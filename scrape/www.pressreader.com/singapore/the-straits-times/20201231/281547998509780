    <p>The United States risks los­ing ground against Covid-19 as a new post-hol­i­day surge fills hos­pi­tals and the scale of vac­cine ad­min­is­tra­tion falls be­low expectatio­ns.</p>
    <p>Adding to wor­ries is the de­tec­tion of the first known case of the more con­ta­gious Bri­tish vari­ant in Colorado, in a young man with no travel his­tory, sug­gest­ing lo­cal trans­mis­sion of un­known ori­gin.</p>
    <p>The United States risks los­ing ground against the Covid-19 coro­n­avirus as a new post-hol­i­day surge in in­fec­tions fills hos­pi­tals and the scale of vac­cine ad­min­is­tra­tion falls be­low expectatio­ns.</p>
    <p>Adding to wor­ries is the de­tec­tion that was re­vealed, on Tues­day, of the first known case in the US of the more con­ta­gious vari­ant that was first iden­ti­fied in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The case is in Colorado, in a young man in his 20s with no travel his­tory, sug­gest­ing lo­cal trans­mis­sion of un­known ori­gin.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Colorado Gov­er­nor Jared Po­lis said: “The in­di­vid­ual has no close con­tacts iden­ti­fied so far, but public health of­fi­cials are work­ing to iden­tify other po­ten­tial cases and con­tacts through thor­ough con­tact trac­ing in­ter­views.”</p>
    <p>This came as the United States’ death toll from the virus con­tin­ues to mount, with a fresh post-hol­i­day surge on top of the pre­vi­ous, post-Thanks­giv­ing one.</p>
    <p>With more than 63,000 dead in just 26 days, this has been the dead­li­est month for the US since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>Even worse is com­ing, ex­perts warn.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the US recorded a new daily high of more than 3,700 new deaths linked to the coro­n­avirus. It also re­ported the most hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions from Covid-19, with more than 124,600 pa­tients na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral states are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing record lev­els of new in­fec­tions. Ge­or­gia Gov­er­nor Brian Kemp said the state was about to open a tem­po­rary hospi­tal with an ad­di­tional 60 beds.</p>
    <p>Texas of­fi­cials re­ported a record 11,700 hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>In Los An­ge­les County, Cal­i­for­nia, hos­pi­tals are re­port­edly run­ning out of oxy­gen, with Covid-19 in­pa­tient num­bers near­ing 7,200 – al­most 1,000 times higher than just two months ago.</p>
    <p>Stay-at-home or­ders were re­newed in­def­i­nitely on Tues­day for al­most the en­tire state.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the vac­cine roll-out is en­coun­ter­ing prob­lems. Fewer doses than pre­dicted are be­ing shipped to states. And many states are short of re­sources.</p>
    <p>States and public health of­fi­cials have been ask­ing for more than US$8 bil­lion (S$10.6 bil­lion) in ad­di­tional fund­ing for the vac­ci­na­tion drive. The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has thus far pro­vided just US$340 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“We’re try­ing to do every­thing on a shoestring, when re­ally we need vast amounts of money in­vested,” Ms Ann Le­wandowski of the Ru­ral Wis­con­sin Health Co­op­er­a­tive told the me­dia this week.</p>
    <p>Around US$8 bil­lion is pro­vided for in the coro­n­avirus stim­u­lus pack­age signed by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Sun­day, so there is some hope that the ef­fort will scale up once the funds are dis­bursed. But mean­while, the ef­fort has fallen be­hind.</p>
    <p>While Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Sec­re­tary Alex Azar has said ev­ery Amer­i­can will be able to get the vac­cine by the end of next June – which pre­sumes a rate of vac­ci­na­tion of 3.5 mil­lion a day – the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Control and Pre­ven­tion on Mon­day said 2.1 mil­lion doses of coro­n­avirus vac­cines have been ad­min­is­tered in two weeks.</p>
    <p>Dr Leana S. Wen, vis­it­ing pro­fes­sor of health pol­icy and man­age­ment at the Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton Univer­sity Milken In­sti­tute School of Public Health, tweeted on Tues­day: “At the cur­rent rate of #covid19 vac­ci­na­tions, it will take the US 10 years to in­oc­u­late 80 per cent of Amer­i­cans.”</p>
    <p>She blamed the un­der­per­for­mance on “over­promis­ing then mov­ing the goal­post. Dif­fus­ing re­spon­si­bil­ity to states with­out giv­ing them guid­ance or re­sources”.</p>
    <p>“It is a real tragedy to have vac­cines sit in ware­houses when thou­sands are dy­ing ev­ery day,” she tweeted.</p>
    <p>Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases di­rec­tor An­thony Fauci said on Mon­day: “We are be­low where we want to be.</p>
    <p>“Not be­ing re­spon­si­ble my­self for the roll-out, I can’t per­son­ally guar­an­tee that we’re go­ing to catch up. I hope we do.”</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den in a speech crit­i­cised the speed of vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>But he also tem­pered expectatio­ns, say­ing: “This will take more time than any­one would like and more time than the prom­ises from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion have sug­gested.</p>
    <p>“This is go­ing to be the greatest op­er­a­tional chal­lenge we’ve ever faced as a na­tion, but we are go­ing to get it done. It’s go­ing to take a vast new ef­fort that is not yet un­der way.”</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the coro­n­avirus for the first time took the life of a con­gress­man. Louisiana Repub­li­can Luke Let­low, 41, elected this month and due to be sworn in on Sun­day, tested pos­i­tive on Dec 18.</p>
    <p>On Dec 19, he was hos­pi­talised, and treated with steroids and the an­tivi­ral drug remde­sivir. Eleven days after test­ing pos­i­tive, he died, leav­ing be­hind his wife and two chil­dren.</p>
