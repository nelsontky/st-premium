    <p>We re­fer to se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik’s com­men­tary (Why pri­vate health in­surance prac­tices need fix­ing, Dec 10) and points raised by the In­surance and Fi­nan­cial Prac­ti­tion­ers As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore in its let­ter (Agent com­mis­sions not a cost with­out value, Dec 22).</p>
    <p>We agree that costs need to be man­aged for health­care to re­main af­ford­able. Some fac­tors lead­ing to th­ese in­creased health­care costs, such as im­proved ac­cess to ap­pro­pri­ate health­care, lead to im­proved health. But there are also cost in­creases which add min­i­mal value to out­comes, and th­ese need to be ac­tively tack­led.</p>
    <p>The rein­tro­duc­tion of co-pay­ment for pol­i­cy­hold­ers of In­te­grated Shield Plans (IPs) with rid­ers is a key step in man­ag­ing health­care costs. Co-pay­ment for new rid­ers took ef­fect on April 1 last year, and pol­i­cy­hold­ers who pur­chased ex­ist­ing rid­ers from April 2018 to March last year must switch to the new co-pay rid­ers by April 1 next year, as man­dated by the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>How­ever, health claims in­fla­tion for pol­i­cy­hold­ers with­out rid­ers is also high, al­beit lower than for those with rid­ers. Hence, rid­ers are not the only fac­tor driv­ing up health­care costs.</p>
    <p>Claims cost in­creases are the pri­mary rea­son for pre­mium in­creases. While man­age­ment and dis­tri­bu­tion costs fac­tor into pre­mi­ums, th­ese have re­mained rel­a­tively sta­ble.</p>
    <p>Man­age­ment ex­pense as a frac­tion of gross pre­mium de­clined from 2010 to last year, and cur­rently ranges from 5 per cent to 11 per cent for IP in­sur­ers with size­able books of busi­ness. To­tal dis­tri­bu­tion cost also de­clined over the same pe­riod, rang­ing from 7 per cent to 16 per cent.</p>
    <p>IP in­sur­ers have been ac­tively im­ple­ment­ing mea­sures to fur­ther re­duce man­age­ment ex­penses, such as au­tomat­ing claims pro­cess­ing.</p>
    <p>The spe­cific in­surer cited by Ms Kha­lik for hav­ing more than half of pre­mi­ums col­lected go to man­age­ment and dis­tri­bu­tion costs is an out­lier – rel­a­tively new to the mar­ket with a smaller port­fo­lio and may not yet have economies of scale. Its dis­tri­bu­tion costs may also be higher be­cause com­mis­sions are higher in the first year of a pol­icy.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ing health­care costs are in­deed a na­tional con­cern and rein­tro­duc­ing co-pay­ment is only part of the answer. Ef­fec­tively ad­dress­ing this is­sue re­quires a multi-stake­holder ap­proach which brings to­gether in­sur­ers, pol­i­cy­hold­ers, health­care providers and the Gov­ern­ment to play their part in keep­ing health­care af­ford­able in the long term.</p>
