    <p>•</p>
    <p>China’s re­cov­ery from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic con­tin­ued in the third quar­ter and showed signs of broad­en­ing as con­sumer spend­ing ac­cel­er­ated, keep­ing the econ­omy on track to be the world’s only ma­jor one to grow this year.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) ex­panded 4.9 per cent in the third quar­ter from a year ago, miss­ing econ­o­mists’ fore­cast for a 5.5 per cent ex­pan­sion. Both re­tail sales and in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion gained mo­men­tum last month, re­as­sur­ing mar­kets that the coun­try’s re­cov­ery is on track.</p>
    <p>The num­bers show China’s early and ag­gres­sive con­tain­ment of the coro­n­avirus has set the econ­omy up for a faster re­bound than any of its peers. That is a rare pos­i­tive for a world econ­omy still claw­ing its way out of its worst slump since the Great De­pres­sion – a re­vival fur­ther com­pli­cated by the resur­gent virus in Europe and the United States.</p>
    <p>“It’s an en­cour­ag­ing and hope­ful mes­sage for the rest of the world,” said Mr Rob Sub­bara­man, global head of macro re­search at No­mura Hold­ings in Singapore. “If you suc­cess­fully han­dle the health cri­sis, your econ­omy can re­cover.”</p>
    <p>Re­tail sales ex­panded 3.3 per cent last month from a year ear­lier, in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion grew 6.9 per cent and in­vest­ment growth ac­cel­er­ated to 0.8 per cent in the nine months to the end of the quar­ter. Strong im­port growth in the third quar­ter may have dented the GDP number, even though it is broadly seen as a bullish sign for de­mand.</p>
    <p>Out­put ex­panded 0.7 per cent in the year to date, mean­ing that the world’s se­cond-largest econ­omy has now re­gained all the ground it lost in the early months of the year.</p>
    <p>Mar­kets were mixed on the news yes­ter­day. The CSI 300 In­dex of stocks, which last week was within 1 per cent of a five-year high, fell 0.3 per cent as of the mid­day break in Shang­hai. The yuan was lit­tle changed near 6.7 per US dol­lar, af­ter briefly trad­ing at its strong­est in 18 months.</p>
    <p>Un­der­pin­ning the re­cov­ery has been the con­tain­ment of the virus that has al­lowed fac­to­ries to quickly re­open and cap­i­talise on a global rush for med­i­cal equip­ment and work-from-home tech­nol­ogy. That ex­port strength was off­set by a re­cent in­crease in im­ports, de­press­ing the con­tri­bu­tion of net trade to out­put growth.</p>
    <p>“That should not be viewed neg­a­tively,” said China econ­o­mist Liu Peiqian at Natwest Mar­kets in Singapore, be­cause the strong im­port growth sug­gests that the re­cov­ery in un­der­ly­ing eco­nomic growth is ac­cel­er­at­ing.</p>
    <p>The im­prov­ing pic­ture has come with rel­a­tively re­strained gov­ern­ment bor­row­ing and cen­tral bank eas­ing com­pared with China’s peers. In­stead, the gov­ern­ment has fo­cused on tar­geted sup­port for busi­ness and the cen­tral bank on keep­ing liq­uid­ity flow­ing; to­day’s read­ings sug­gest there is no need to change tack.</p>
    <p>Cen­tral bank gov­er­nor Yi Gang said on Sun­day that China has “proac­tive fis­cal pol­icy” and “an acom­moda­tive mon­e­tary pol­icy to sup­port the econ­omy”.</p>
    <p>“Right now, China has ba­si­cally got Covid-19 un­der con­trol,” he said at a we­bi­nar or­gan­ised by the Group of 30. “In gen­eral, the Chi­nese econ­omy re­mains re­silient with great po­ten­tial. Con­tin­ued re­cov­ery is an­tic­i­pated, which will ben­e­fit the global econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Yet the re­cov­ery is not with­out its holes. Even with the virus un­der con­trol, shop­pers have spent about 7 per cent less in the first nine months of the year com­pared with the same pe­riod last year. Ser­vices sec­tors in­clud­ing tourism, ed­u­ca­tion and travel are con­tin­u­ing to lag.</p>
    <p>“The econ­omy is not en­tirely back in its strong­est shape,” Ms He­len Qiao, chief Greater China econ­o­mist at Bank of Amer­ica, told Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion. “The ser­vices sec­tor is not do­ing that well.”</p>
    <p>It is also un­clear how durable the re­cov­ery will prove to be, given do­mes­tic pres­sures from un­em­ploy­ment and ris­ing cor­po­rate and house­hold debt. China Ever­grande Group, the world’s most in­debted de­vel­oper, has rat­tled in­vestors amid fears for its fi­nan­cial health.</p>
    <p>Much will also de­pend on how re­la­tions with the United States evolve af­ter Novem­ber’s pres­i­den­tial election. Any wors­en­ing of trade fric­tions could throw a span­ner in the ex­port re­vival.</p>
    <p>Anal­y­sis of In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) data shows that the pro­por­tion of world­wide growth com­ing from China is ex­pected to in­crease from 26.8 per cent next year to 27.7 per cent in 2025, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg cal­cu­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The IMF says Chi­nese growth is vir­tu­ally the only rea­son it ex­pects global out­put to be 0.6 per cent higher by the end of 2021 com­pared with the end of 2019.</p>
    <p>Get­ting the econ­omy quickly back on its feet is cru­cial to China’s global am­bi­tions. This was ham­mered home last week by President Xi Jin­ping dur­ing a tour of tech­nol­ogy hub Shen­zhen, where he dou­bled down on calls to take the global lead in tech­nol­ogy and other strate­gic in­dus­tries.</p>
