    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Some­thing that starts small gets un­der your skin, so make sure you are ready to dis­cuss it or find a way to re­lease the pres­sure once it starts to build.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy is con­flicted – so much so that you may find it harder to re­late to cer­tain peo­ple. Try your best to just smile and wait for this phase to pass.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>What is the big­gest mys­tery in your life? It is time to tackle it. Your en­ergy may be primed for ad­ven­ture, but take on only as much as you know you can han­dle.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>This may not be the best time to deal with busi­ness ne­go­ti­a­tions. Wait un­til you are ab­so­lutely sure of your­self.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Let your­self be self­ish to­day? Your en­ergy is a lit­tle tied up in knots, so it is only fair that you should be able to do what you like.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your abil­ity to reach peo­ple and get them to see things your way is height­ened. You should find it easy to make friends and in­flu­ence peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Go shop­ping or dive into that ma­jor pur­chase you have been putting off. You are like­lier to get a good deal and some­times you have to go big or go home.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Al­most ev­ery­one can see your aura of power in the room, so act as if you have come out on top. You should be able to make good things hap­pen with ease.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your imag­i­na­tion is your most po­tent as­set, so make sure you are us­ing it like a boss. That could mean de­rail­ing old plans or start­ing out in bold di­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You have to get or­gan­ised – even if that feels like an im­pos­si­ble task.</p>
    <p>Keep fo­cus­ing on what is most vi­tal and take a lit­tle time out to ask for help.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your emo­tions feel raw and ex­posed, but do not let that keep you from any­thing im­por­tant. They could help you out, so re­lax and see what hap­pens.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing fuzzy-headed, but it is noth­ing to worry about. You get along bet­ter than most with a lack of in­for­ma­tion. Go ahead with your in­tu­ition.</p>
