    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Se­cu­rity of­fi­cers in dark suits drew their pis­tols and trained them on the shout­ing mob try­ing to smash their way through the door of the nor­mally se­date House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives cham­ber.</p>
    <p>The ex­tra­or­di­nary scene un­folded amid the un­prece­dented as­sault on the US Congress by sup­port­ers of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>It was one of many shock­ing mo­ments that played out on tele­vi­sion screens across the world as the seat of an iconic democ­racy came un­der as­sault from hun­dreds of pro­test­ers an­gered by Mr Trump’s loss to his Demo­cratic op­po­nent Joe Bi­den in last Novem­ber’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>One woman was shot and killed in a chaotic crush of peo­ple near a stair­way. A video posted on so­cial me­dia showed what sounded like a gun­shot and an of­fi­cer in dark cloth­ing armed with a ri­fle stand­ing near where she fell. Other of­fi­cers rushed to as­sist her. The cir­cum­stances of her shoot­ing, in­clud­ing who fired the shot, were not clear. Three oth­ers died of “med­i­cal emer­gen­cies”, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>What be­gan as a rau­cous protest against Mr Trump’s de­feat boiled over into a siege of the Capi­tol – a sym­bol of US democ­racy – that paral­ysed Congress as it went through the fi­nal steps of rat­i­fy­ing the vic­tory of Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Riot­ers brawled with po­lice of­fi­cers, pushed their way past metal se­cu­rity bar­ri­cades, broke win­dows and forced their way inside the build­ing, forc­ing law­mak­ers in both the House and the Se­nate to sus­pend their work and in­stead go into hid­ing in of­fices and other se­cured rooms.</p>
    <p>A grey-bearded pro­tester used what looked like a plex­i­glass riot shield to break a glass win­dow of the Capi­tol, clear­ing the way for riot­ers to climb through.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers with mil­i­tary ex­pe­ri­ence, in­clud­ing Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Ja­son Crow, a for­mer US Army Ranger, and Repub­li­can Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Mark­wayne Mullin, a for­mer mixed mar­tial arts fighter, jumped in to help.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Reuben Gal­lego, a for­mer Marine, told fel­low House mem­bers how to put on their gas masks.</p>
    <p>Much of the melee was cap­tured in pho­tos and videos posted on so­cial me­dia and news footage, and wit­nessed by jour­nal­ists.</p>
    <p>The riot­ers who stormed the Capi­tol roamed freely through the cor­ri­dors, car­ry­ing flags – at least one a large Con­fed­er­ate bat­tle en­sign – and snap­ping pho­to­graphs.</p>
    <p>One man posed for a photo in the of­fice of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, one booted foot propped on the cor­ner of her desk.</p>
    <p>Another grinned at a news pho­tog­ra­pher as he carted a lectern down a hall­way.</p>
    <p>As demon­stra­tors pressed closer to law­mak­ers, they scuf­fled with of­fi­cers. One group dis­charged a fire</p>
    <p>SOUND OF GUN­FIRE</p>
    <p>ex­tin­guisher, leav­ing a haze. Tear gas blew into the ro­tunda be­neath the iconic build­ing’s soar­ing dome.</p>
    <p>Some riot­ers be­sieged the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives cham­ber while law­mak­ers were inside, bang­ing on its doors, cut­ting off es­cape routes.</p>
    <p>“It... felt like it was hap­pen­ing in slow mo­tion,” said Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Eric Swal­well.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity of­fi­cers piled fur­ni­ture against the cham­ber’s door and drew their pis­tols. Law­mak­ers and re­porters heard l oud pop­ping noises from out­side and dived for cover on the floor.</p>
    <p>“I was open­ing my gas mask and we heard ‘pop, pop, pop’, and we all went down,” said Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Vi­cente Gon­za­lez.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 15 min­utes, Capi­tol po­lice of­fi­cers se­cured enough of a path­way through the Capi­tol to es­cort House mem­bers from the cham­ber to another lo­ca­tion, urg­ing them to hurry as they wound down stairs and through tun­nels to avoid the chaos.</p>
    <p>SHEL­TER­ING IN OF­FICES</p>
    <p>Many House mem­bers were in their of­fices when the as­sault hap­pened as Mrs Pelosi had lim­ited the num­ber of peo­ple in the cham­ber to 11 from each party be­cause of con­cerns about the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Some evac­u­ated at the urg­ing of the Capi­tol po­lice, while oth­ers bar­ri­caded them­selves inside their of­fices. Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Mike Gal­lagher, a Repub­li­can from Wis­con­sin, said in a video on so­cial me­dia that he was “shel­ter­ing in place” in his of­fice. “This is banana repub­lic crap that we are watch­ing hap­pen right now,” he said.</p>
    <p>Across the Capi­tol, other demon­stra­tors pushed into the Se­nate gallery, where min­utes ear­lier se­cu­rity of­fi­cials had evac­u­ated law­mak­ers and Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, who presided over the vote-count­ing.</p>
    <p>A few climbed down from the gallery to the cham­ber floor, then climbed to the dais for pho­to­graphs. One man, bare-chested and wear­ing a fur hat with horns, his face painted red, white and blue, posed for pho­tos there hold­ing an Amer­i­can flag.</p>
    <p>Dozens of law­mak­ers hun­kered down in a se­cure room for hours while of­fi­cers worked to clear the build­ing. Law­mak­ers from both par­ties, riven hours ear­lier by the elec­tion out­come, prayed to­gether for Amer­i­can democ­racy.</p>
    <p>When Congress re­turned on Wed­nes­day night to re­sume count­ing of the votes, clus­ters of armed agents, some wear­ing tac­ti­cal gear and car­ry­ing au­to­matic weapons, were sta­tioned around the Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>I was open­ing my gas mask and we heard ‘pop, pop, pop’, and we all went down. ’’</p>
