    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong’s new hot­line for res­i­dents to re­port vi­o­la­tions of a con­tro­ver­sial na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion re­ceived 1,000 tips hours af­ter l aunch­ing, the South China Morn­ing Post re­ported, citing a po­lice spokesman.</p>
    <p>The tip line was an­nounced on Thurs­day by the Hong Kong Po­lice Force’s Na­tional Se­cu­rity De­part­ment, a unit set up af­ter the June en­act­ment of the law crim­i­nal­is­ing sub­ver­sion, se­ces­sion, as well as col­lu­sion with for­eign pow­ers and ter­ror­ism.</p>
    <p>The line was aimed at “fa­cil­i­tat­ing mem­bers of the public to pro­vide or re­port na­tional se­cu­rity re­lated in­for­ma­tion”, in­clud­ing pho­tos, au­dio and video clips, the po­lice said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents will be able to send such in­for­ma­tion over e-mail, texts or the Chi­nese so­cial mes­sag­ing plat­form WeChat, the po­lice state­ment said.</p>
    <p>The po­lice force did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment about the Post’s re­port.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar­ity of the hot­line could fuel more con­cerns about free­doms in the city un­der the na­tional se­cu­rity law, which has been crit­i­cised by democ­racy ad­vo­cates and for­eign gov­ern­ments as an as­sault on Hong Kong’s fu­ture as a safe place for in­ter­na­tional busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The law’s en­act­ment dra­mat­i­cally wors­ened ties be­tween the Asian fi­nan­cial hub and West­ern democ­ra­cies in­clud­ing the United States, lead­ing sev­eral coun­tries to sus­pend ex­tra­di­tion agree­ments with the for­mer Bri­tish colony.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong of­fi­cials and their back­ers in Bei­jing have ar­gued that the law was nec­es­sary to re­store sta­bil­ity and eco­nomic pros­per­ity af­ter months of some­times-vi­o­lent prodemoc­racy protests helped push the city into a re­ces­sion, even be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While many law en­force­ment agen­cies – in­clud­ing the US De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity and the Lon­don Metropolit­an Po­lice – di­rect cit­i­zens to ter­ror­ism tip lines,</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s na­tional se­cu­rity law also in­cludes po­lit­i­cal crimes such as sup­port­ing in­de­pen­dence or in­cit­ing ha­tred against the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>More than half of the 28 peo­ple ar­rested so far by the po­lice unit re­spon­si­ble for the law are fac­ing al­le­ga­tions re­lated to speech deemed se­ces­sion­ist or sedi­tious, such as wav­ing ban­ners, chant­ing slo­gans or mak­ing on­line posts.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong line is sim­i­lar to one that ex­ists in main­land China. The coun­try’s Min­istry of State Se­cu­rity launched a hot­line and on­line plat­form in 2018 to re­ceive re­ports from in­di­vid­u­als about po­ten­tial spy­ing ac­tiv­i­ties and be­hav­iour that en­dan­gered na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also promised to award peo­ple who pro­vided use­ful in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s na­tional se­cu­rity law was drafted in Bei­jing by cen­tral gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and im­posed on the semi-au­tonomous city over the sum­mer, with­out any for­mal lo­cal de­bate.</p>
    <p>Since then, Hong Kong’s protests have largely dis­si­pated, some po­lit­i­cal groups have dis­banded and a hand­ful of peo­ple have been ar­rested un­der the new law.</p>
