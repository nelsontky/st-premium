    <p>LIS­BON • Corentin Tolisso says tre­ble-chas­ing Bay­ern Mu­nich should be wary of his former club Lyon in to­day’s Cham­pi­ons League semi-fi­nal as the “greedy” Bavar­i­ans look to build on their stun­ning de­mo­li­tion of Barcelona.</p>
    <p>Both Ju­ven­tus and Manchester City paid the price for un­der­es­ti­mat­ing the French side, who ended sev­enth after the Ligue 1 sea­son ended in April be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As a Lyon academy grad­u­ate and hav­ing spent a decade there be­fore leav­ing the club in 2017, Tolisso is well aware of their pedi­gree, de­spite never win­ning the Cham­pi­ons League and only reach­ing this late stage once be­fore in 2010.</p>
    <p>On his coun­try’s sec­ond-rich­est foot­ball team, who have played in Europe for 23 straight sea­sons, the France mid­fielder said: “From a Ger­man point of view, per­haps Lyon’s the least known team.</p>
    <p>“But against City, we all saw what this team are ca­pa­ble of. We will never un­der­es­ti­mate them. When the big games come up, Lyon are al­ways there. No team can reach the semi-fi­nals by chance.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the words of cau­tion, Bay­ern are the favourites, not just to progress past the last four, but also to win their sixth Euro­pean Cup.</p>
    <p>There is an air of de­ter­mi­na­tion in the camp of the Bun­desliga cham­pi­ons, who have clinched the Ger­man Cup and have de­signs on their sec­ond tre­ble after their first in 2013. Only Barcelona have ever won two tre­bles – in 2009 and 2015.</p>
    <p>De­fender Jerome Boateng, who was part of that 2013 team, feels this cur­rent crop is as good as the side that had club greats like Ar­jen Robben, Bas­tian Sch­we­in­steiger and Philipp Lahm.</p>
    <p>“To be hon­est, I no­ticed from day one that some­thing was up,” the Ger­many de­fender said. “That was our big goal for the sea­son.</p>
    <p>“We played better in the Cham­pi­ons League from the start than we might have done in the Bun­desliga. We were ex­tremely greedy all the time.”</p>
    <p>This team ap­pear to have the same in­sa­tiable ap­petite for tro­phies, earn­ing the nick­name “FC</p>
    <p>Never Sat­is­fied” by the Ger­man me­dia and they are cer­tainly hun­gry for goals too.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern’s av­er­age of 4.33 goals per game is a new Cham­pi­ons League record, hav­ing net­ted 39 times in nine Euro­pean games.</p>
    <p>To top it off, Poland striker Robert Le­wandowski is the com­pe­ti­tion’s top scorer with 14 goals – three short of Cris­tiano Ron­aldo’s 2013-14 record in a sin­gle Cham­pi­ons League sea­son.</p>
    <p>How­ever, noth­ing is be­ing taken for granted against Lyon.</p>
    <p>“The next game is al­ways the most dif­fi­cult,” said Boateng, de­spite Bay­ern win­ning their last 20 games and be­ing on an un­beaten run since Ger­man foot­ball re­sumed in May.</p>
    <p>“The thrash­ing of Barcelona now counts for noth­ing. Our op­po­nent is not standing where he is for noth­ing.”</p>
    <p>Both Bay­ern and Lyon have no new in­juries to report, with Hansi Flick’s men set to wel­come back France de­fender Ben­jamin Pavard, who missed their past two games due to an an­kle com­plaint.</p>
    <p>TRE­BLE TAR­GET</p>
    <p>To be hon­est, I no­ticed from day one that some­thing was up. That was our big goal for the sea­son... We were ex­tremely greedy all the time. ’’</p>
    <p>JEROME BOATENG, Bay­ern de­fender, on ex­pect­ing big things from the lat­est squad, hav­ing won the tre­ble with the Ger­man gi­ants in 2013.</p>
