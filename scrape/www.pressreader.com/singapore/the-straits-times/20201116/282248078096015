    <p>Hoh Law Cor­po­ra­tion, which topped the list in the neg­li­gence law cat­e­gory in the ST Best Law Firms 2021 sur­vey and was also ranked among the top law firms in fam­ily law and man­power and em­ploy­ment, opened its 10th branch of­fice in Wood­lands last week.</p>
    <p>Started by Mr Hoh Chin Cha in 1991 with a mod­est of­fice in Mid­dle Road, the com­pany now has the most num­ber of branches of any law firm in Sin­ga­pore and has firmly es­tab­lished it­self as one with a ded­i­cated fo­cus on com­mu­nity is­sues and pro­vid­ing le­gal so­lu­tions to the masses.</p>
    <p>“Our com­mit­ment to pro­vid­ing qual­ity le­gal so­lu­tions at af­ford­able prices has been ac­knowl­edged by our stake­hold­ers, peers and clients, as shown by this sur­vey,” said Mr Hoh, the firm’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Our work cen­tres on neg­li­gence, fam­ily law and em­ploy­ment is­sues. In this re­spect, we rou­tinely ad­vise and rep­re­sent mi­grant work­ers who have been in­volved in ac­ci­dents in the course of their em­ploy­ment and are com­mit­ted to en­sur­ing that their in­ter­ests are pro­tected. We also fre­quently ren­der pro bono as­sis­tance to en­sure that mi­grant work­ers are af­forded equal ac­cess to jus­tice,” he added.</p>
    <p>The firm has han­dled a litany of headline-grab­bing cases over the years. For ex­am­ple, they helped a woman ob­tain com­pen­sa­tion after she was paral­ysed by the fall­ing branches of a tree within a cathe­dral’s precincts in 2009.</p>
    <p>In serv­ing the pub­lic, Hoh Law Cor­po­ra­tion has forged strong part­ner­ships with the com­mu­nity and with var­i­ous char­i­ties and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions, said Mr Hoh.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is also in­volved in Bangladesh, in the con­struc­tion of a com­plex hous­ing a nurs­ing home and lodg­ing fa­cil­i­ties for work­ers who need ac­com­mo­da­tion while await­ing travel ar­range­ments to Sin­ga­pore. The nurs­ing home, lo­cated near a hospi­tal, is to be op­er­ated with a lo­cal char­ity. It is due to open next year and will serve Bangladesh­i work­ers in­jured while work­ing in Sin­ga­pore, Mr Hoh added.</p>
    <p>“Closer to home, Hoh Law Cor­po­ra­tion also worked to­gether with var­i­ous non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions and char­i­ties dur­ing the Covid-19 pandemic by re­sourc­ing the dis­tri­bu­tion of rice and masks to for­eign work­ers in Sin­ga­pore and in Bangladesh,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We have also pledged $1 mil­lion to es­tab­lish the HOH Foun­da­tion – which re­flects our mis­sion to serve the com­mu­nity, the peo­ple and the masses with in­tegrity.”</p>
    <p>Mr Hoh added that the foun­da­tion, which is pend­ing reg­is­tra­tion, will be fi­nanc­ing the daily op­er­at­ing costs of the home in Bangladesh in ad­di­tion to its con­struc­tion.</p>
