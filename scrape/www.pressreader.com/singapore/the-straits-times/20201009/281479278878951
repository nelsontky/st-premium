    <p>Crocs and Justin Bieber. Longchamp and Poke­mon. Louis Vuit­ton and the NBA.</p>
    <p>A Franken­stein story of fash­ion? Not quite. These un­likely tie-ups are j ust some of the head­line­mak­ing part­ner­ships in the fash­ion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Like many trends, the phe­nom­e­non of the fash­ion col­lab­o­ra­tion has evolved over the years. And these days, big­ger, bolder and more bizarre seems to be the new game play.</p>
    <p>While nei­ther Crocs nor the Cana­dian pop star – who first hinted about the tie-up on In­sta­gram – has con­firmed the al­liance, it is not im­prob­a­ble. The foam footwear brand has re­leased its share of sur­pris­ing col­lab­o­ra­tions, its most re­cent be­ing with Latin rap­per Bad Bunny.</p>
    <p>The glow-in-the-dark shoe sold out in 16 minutes.</p>
    <p>There is business value in shock value, says as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of mar­ket­ing at Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity Han­nah Chang, who adds that it has been a “very strange year” in terms of fash­ion col­lab­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“We’re see­ing a lot of sur­pris­ing and some­what un­ex­pected col­lab­o­ra­tions,” she says.</p>
    <p>She sin­gles out “in­dus­try cross­over col­lab­o­ra­tions” like Louis Vuit­ton and the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA), or Ikea and Of­fWhite founder Vir­gil Abloh l ast year for do­ing a good job of cap­tur­ing com­pletely dif­fer­ent tar­get mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 may even have a part to play. While she ac­knowl­edges that “col­labs don’t hap­pen overnight”, the re­leases this year come when the fight for eye­balls is more cru­cial than ever.</p>
    <p>“It’s a time that’s fairly dif­fi­cult to get con­sumers’ at­ten­tion. Even though con­sumers are stuck at home and spend­ing more time on screens, you’re also com­pet­ing with a lot more peo­ple for their at­ten­tion – so how do you stand out?</p>
    <p>“This type of un­ex­pected, high­pro­file brand col­lab­o­ra­tion not only broad­ens con­sumer ap­peal, but also helps cap­ture at­ten­tion.”</p>
    <p>The fash­ion col­lab­o­ra­tion had ar­guably no­ble and cre­ative in­ten­tions – be­gin­ning i n the early 2000s – when it first took off as a com­mer­cial nov­elty.</p>
    <p>Many credit Louis Vuit­ton as a fron­trun­ner, in court­ing punk fash­ion de­signer Stephen Sprouse in 2001 for his take on LV clas­sics; and Ja­panese con­tem­po­rary artist Takashi Mu­rakami two years later.</p>
    <p>The late Karl Lager­feld and fast­fash­ion gi­ant H&M teamed up in 2004 – kick-start­ing the lat­ter’s yearly se­ries of col­lab­o­ra­tions – and Ja­panese ap­parel brand Uniqlo soon fol­lowed suit, with a string of high-pro­file part­ner­ships in­clud­ing one with Ger­man de­signer Jil San­der that helped ce­ment the brand’s rep­u­ta­tion to­day as a leader in col­lab­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>By the 2010s, ev­ery­one in the in­dus­try was part­ner­ing some way or an­other.</p>
    <p>No doubt, there is ap­peal in work­ing to­gether. As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ang Swee Hoon, deputy head of the de­part­ment of mar­ket­ing at the NUS Business School, points out that brands col­lab­o­rate be­cause of “a win-win” – in gen­er­at­ing more aware­ness, ex­pand­ing to a larger tar­get mar­ket and cul­ti­vat­ing a more favourable brand im­age.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, the bot­tom line is sales. Look at the col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween Nike and Michael Jor­dan (in 1984) – Air Jor­dan has be­come so huge it now op­er­ates as a dis­tinct business from Nike.”</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager Tami Lai, 29, re­calls us­ing her lunch break to shop for the Uniqlo x Christophe Le­maire col­lab­o­ra­tion when it ar­rived five years ago.</p>
    <p>“I was drawn to the col­lec­tion be­cause of the min­i­mal­ist aes­thetic of the pieces, which fits my style. I also liked that it made them quite dis­tinct from the reg­u­lar Uniqlo lines and it def­i­nitely helped that they were at Uniqlo price points,” she says.</p>
    <p>But not all tie-ups get her dol­lar, adds the dis­cern­ing shop­per, even if they in­volve brands that she likes.</p>
    <p>“I’ll con­sider mak­ing a pur­chase only if the piece is some­thing that I’d wear and if it’s within bud­get.”</p>
    <p>As­soc Prof Ang says with the eco­nomic down­turn af­fect­ing many busi­nesses, col­lab­o­ra­tions may be all the more ef­fec­tive in stretch­ing the mar­ket­ing dol­lar for both par­ties.</p>
    <p>“We can look for­ward to col­lab­o­ra­tions be­yond the usual de­sign realm,” she pre­dicts. “Brands are learning that work­ing to­gether can be more fruit­ful. It is good to see more col­lab­o­ra­tion than com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>TEAM­WORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK</p>
    <p>One en­cour­ag­ing trend that has come out of Covid-19 is a greater ap­pre­ci­a­tion of lo­cal tal­ent, in the light of pan­demic-in­duced lock­downs around the world, ob­serves As­soc Prof Chang.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple started feel­ing that it was time to sup­port one an­other; there was a joint iden­tity. It’s an ex­cel­lent idea for a brand to work with lo­cal brands – to say ‘we’re in this to­gether’.”</p>
    <p>Ja­panese sports­wear brand Asics is one such ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Last month, it sought 30 lo­cal and re­gional cre­atives for a cam­paign to com­mem­o­rate the 30th an­niver­sary of its Gel-Lyte III sneaker. Eleven cre­atives across a range of dis­ci­plines from Sin­ga­pore were asked to make their mark on the sneaker.</p>
    <p>It was a nod to the brand’s “legacy of mak­ing a mark on sneaker de­sign, while sup­port­ing the next gen­er­a­tion of cre­atives cur­rently mak­ing their own mark on the cre­ative in­dus­try”, says Mr Roy Lan, re­gional mar­ket­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager at Asics Asia.</p>
    <p>“While we did work with some notable names in the re­gion, we felt it was im­por­tant to give ex­po­sure to up-and-com­ing cre­atives who would ben­e­fit from this plat­form.”</p>
    <p>One of the col­lab­o­ra­tors, henna artist Shasha Soet, 28, has seen more in­ter­est in both her business and the medium of henna since the cam­paign launched.</p>
    <p>The self-taught bridal henna artist (@nit­tra­hen­nadef­i­ni­tion) painted a re­verse henna de­sign on the shoes, with an ad­join­ing heart on the in­ner soles – her sig­na­ture de­sign for the palms of her brides.</p>
    <p>She has since been ap­proached for cus­tom jobs to paint on peo­ple’s shoes.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple were amazed that you can draw with henna on shoes,” she says. “It’s been great for peo­ple to see my ver­sa­til­ity – to go on dif­fer­ent medi­ums than just skin.”</p>
    <p>Due to “tight pro­duc­tion time­lines” the sneak­ers are not for sale, and in­stead will be show­cased at a sneaker con­ven­tion in Malaysia in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>But the brand has “def­i­nitely re­ceived in­ter­est” from the cre­atives’ au­di­ences about pur­chas­ing the shoes, Mr Lan says, adding that Asics is cur­rently ex­plor­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of work­ing with se­lect de­sign­ers on a cap­sule col­lec­tion for sale next year.</p>
    <p>An­other Asics col­lab­o­ra­tor Toby Tan, 26, be­lieves brands are be­gin­ning to “lever­age on the cre­ativ­ity of artists”, who have long em­braced the spirit of col­lab­o­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>The mu­ral­ist and il­lus­tra­tor (@to­by­ato) has worked with other brands such as Uniqlo, Levi’s and Vans be­fore, mostly for cam­paigns spot­light­ing lo­cal tal­ent.</p>
    <p>“Do­ing good work alone isn’t nec­es­sar­ily enough; we have to re­main rel­e­vant i n the i ndus­try and cre­ative scene.</p>
    <p>“Brand col­lab­o­ra­tions are a good way for us to do that – as brands al­ready have a reach, it gives us a plat­form to show our work,” says Mr Tan, whose de­sign in­cor­po­rates a tiger mo­tif, in a homage to Asics’ her­itage.</p>
    <p>“I don’t mind that the shoe is not for sale. The de­mand is there,” he says, adding that he has had fol­low­ers from Europe ask­ing him if the shoe will be sold there.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a sprint; it’s a marathon. I think if more of these col­lab­o­ra­tions hap­pen, peo­ple will see what Sin­ga­pore cre­atives can do, and even­tu­ally it will lead to cre­at­ing items (with us) for sale. That would be nice, to sup­port lo­cal cre­atives.”</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, col­lab­o­ra­tions should not be hasty de­ci­sions or done short-sight­edly, says As­soc Prof Chang.</p>
    <p>“It has im­me­di­ate ben­e­fits, but in the long term, you have to see how it de­fines and po­si­tions your brand in the mind of cus­tomers. If it con­fuses con­sumers then it might back­fire.”</p>
    <p>There are “spillover ef­fects” such as hav­ing one brand’s neg­a­tive rep­u­ta­tion af­fect the other, she ex­plains.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a triv­ial mat­ter pick­ing which brand to col­lab­o­rate with; the well-known brand al­ways has more to lose.”</p>
    <p>Peo­ple were amazed that you can draw with henna on shoes. It’s been great for peo­ple to see my ver­sa­til­ity – to go on dif­fer­ent medi­ums than just skin.</p>
    <p>HENNA ARTIST SHASHA SOET, one of 11 lo­cal cre­atives Ja­panese sports­wear brand Asics is col­lab­o­rat­ing with for a cam­paign to com­mem­o­rate the 30th an­niver­sary of its Gel-Lyte III sneaker</p>
