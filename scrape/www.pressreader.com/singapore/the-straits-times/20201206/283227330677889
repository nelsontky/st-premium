    <p>MANAMA • For­mula One world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton, who was di­ag­nosed with the coro­n­avirus last week, is strug­gling with the ill­ness and is in doubt for this week’s sea­son-end­ing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The seven-time cham­pion won the Bahrain Grand Prix last week­end and was ruled out of to­day’s Sakhir Grand Prix af­ter wak­ing up on Mon­day with mild symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old is now in the process of iso­lat­ing for 10 days, ac­cord­ing to the es­tab­lished pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>“He is not great,” said Wolff of Hamil­ton, who will be re­placed by Ge­orge Rus­sell for to­day’s race.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 is some­thing you mustn’t take lightly and he is in safe hands. That is the most im­por­tant, but it is these early days that are not so nice.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to Sky Sports F1, Wolff also said Hamil­ton was still suf­fer­ing from “mild symp­toms” and a large dose of frus­tra­tion at miss­ing a race week­end for the first time in his F1 ca­reer since his de­but in Aus­tralia in 2007.</p>
    <p>“As you can imag­ine, a race driver out of his car... com­bine it with Covid, he would rather sit in there (nod­ding to­wards the Mercedes garage).”</p>
    <p>When Hamil­ton com­pletes his 10 days’ iso­la­tion, he will need to take an­other Covid-19 test to en­sure he is given the all-clear ahead of the Abu Dhabi event start­ing on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The Bri­ton is the third driver this year to miss a race due to Covid-19, fol­low­ing Rac­ing Point duo Ser­gio Perez and Lance Stroll.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, his con­tract talks with Mercedes will also have to wait un­til he re­cov­ers, Wolff added.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton is out of con­tract at the end of the year and, af­ter win­ning the cham­pi­onship at l ast month’s Turk­ish Grand Prix, he in­di­cated ne­go­ti­a­tions with the team would step up over the sea­son-end­ing Mid­dle Eastern triple header.</p>
    <p>“Well, the time­line is be­ing pushed back un­til he re­cov­ers,” Wolff said.</p>
    <p>“We know that we need to get it done, pretty well aware both of us. But the pri­or­ity now is of him get­ting back on his feet and be­ing back (coro­n­avirus) neg­a­tive and then we will meet to put pen to pa­per.”</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton, who earns an es­ti­mated £40 mil­lion (S$71.7 mil­lion) a year, be­came the most suc­cess­ful driver in the sport this sea­son, sur­pass­ing Michael Schumacher’s record for most wins and equalling the Ger­man great’s ti­tle haul.</p>
