    <p>Wet weather brings with it a crav­ing for hot and spicy food. And for many, laksa is top on the list.</p>
    <p>The noo­dle soup, flavoured with a paste of chill­ies, shal­lots, gar­lic and can­dlenut and thick­ened with co­conut milk, tick­les the palate and warms you up when the mer­cury drops. And it feels less heavy than when in­gested on a sunny day.</p>
    <p>There are two types of laksa indige­nous to Sin­ga­pore, with one richer i n co­conut milk called Ka­tong laksa af­ter the area where it first be­came pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, there were four stalls along a short stretch of East Coast Road sell­ing this style of laksa, but only one – 328 Ka­tong Laksa – re­mains there to­day.</p>
    <p>It now has five other branches, in­clud­ing in malls such as Tiong Bahru Plaza and West­gate. Com­peti­tors have also sprouted across the is­land.</p>
    <p>The other type of laksa, which is more com­mon, has less co­conut milk and a slightly more wa­tery gravy. It can be found in most hawker cen­tres, but few stand out.</p>
    <p>Many stalls rely on just spices for flavour, with­out both­er­ing to come up with a good base stock. Even some ac­claimed stalls I re­cently tried had this prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Laksa fans, too, fall into two camps. One fac­tion in­sists that the dish is not com­plete with­out cock­les (or hum in Chi­nese di­alects), while the other avoids it be­cause of the metal­lic taste or con­cerns over con­tract­ing hepati­tis A.</p>
    <p>I am for cock­les be­cause I like how they blend in with the spicy noo­dles and add an­other layer to the flavour pro­file. They are also an ex­cel­lent source of vi­ta­min B12, io­dine and iron.</p>
