    <p>It may defy logic but some­times the big­ger the lie, the more it will be be­lieved. How else to ex­plain why more than 10,000 peo­ple fell vic­tim to the now-de­funct scam firm Sun­shine Em­pire, even when it used gim­micky ideas that were prob­a­bly copied from movies.</p>
    <p>One way it sought to im­press po­ten­tial in­vestors was to pro­mote the no­tion of the world’s first un­der­sea theme park and ho­tel, to be built off the coast of Sabah in East Malaysia.</p>
    <p>My col­league Hedy Khoo and I first saw the artist’s im­pres­sion for this project when we were cov­er­ing this saga for The New Pa­per in Oc­to­ber 2007. We agreed that it re­minded us of the crab-like un­der­wa­ter fortress in the James Bond movie The Spy Who Loved Me.</p>
    <p>Sun­shine’s ver­sion was de­signed to look like a lob­ster, but it was much big­ger since it was in­tended to house hun­dreds of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Strangely, no one ques­tioned the vi­a­bil­ity of this project be­cause the plan made no men­tion of how peo­ple would be trans­ported to and from the un­der­sea com­plex.</p>
    <p>To see how they lured in­vestors, Hedy at­tended one of the sales meet­ings at Sun­shine’s of­fice in Toa Payoh Hub, along with more than 100 oth­ers, mostly young peo­ple. As the pri­mary tar­get was young in­vestors, the speaker was a young woman, dressed smartly in a black blazer over a white busi­ness shirt and skirt.</p>
    <p>The talk took the tone of a mo­ti­va­tional speech with the speaker run­ning up en­er­get­i­cally from the back of the room to the stage. She also urged the au­di­ence to ap­plaud them­selves at reg­u­lar in­ter­vals.</p>
    <p>She asked them: “Who is here to learn how to make more money?”</p>
    <p>When some in the au­di­ence re­sponded with a show of hands, she ex­claimed: “Give your­selves a big round of ap­plause!”</p>
    <p>To make peo­ple be­lieve they would be in­vest­ing in a com­pany with a great busi­ness plan, the audi</p>
    <p>ence was shown slide af­ter slide of ma­jor projects in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Other than the un­der­sea project, named the Magic King­dom, there were also plans to build:</p>
    <p>An Em­pire Ma­rine Theme Park in Me­laka com­pris­ing an in­tri­cate net­work of float­ing vil­las and struc­tures that formed the shape of a lion’s head. A multi-mil­lion dol­lar wire­less broad­band project in Tai­wan that would pur­port­edly cover about 90 per cent of the city of Tai Chung.</p>
    <p>A mega shop­ping com­plex-cum-lux­u­ri­ous condo project in Me­laka that was known as Em­pire Sun­shine Villa.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that even the young could in­vest in such big projects, each in­vest­ment pack­age was priced at around $10,000 to $12,000. It was not known how many peo­ple signed af­ter each talk, but some of the par­tic­i­pants came with stacks of dol­lar notes.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the meet­ing, Hedy con­tacted the au­thor­i­ties in Tai­wan,</p>
    <p>Sabah and Me­laka to check whether there were in­deed such projects planned.</p>
    <p>A se­nior town plan­ner of Tai Chung city said while there was in­deed a wire­less broad­band project, this was be­ing done with an­other com­pany that had no links with Sun­shine Em­pire.</p>
    <p>A call to Sabah’s Min­istry of Tourism, Cul­ture and En­vi­ron­ment re­vealed that of­fi­cials there had not heard about the un­der­sea com­plex.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal call, to the Me­laka City Coun­cil, how­ever, came with a twist – a com­pany linked to the group had sub­mit­ted a pro­posal for a com­mer­cial build­ing on a plot of land about the size of a foot­ball field. While this was be­ing re­viewed, the city said no one had sub­mit­ted any plans to build an un­der­wa­ter theme park.</p>
    <p>Not long af­ter re­ports on the du­bi­ous projects were pub­lished, the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment clamped down on the scam, and it was later re­vealed in court that the per­pe­tra­tors had swin­dled nearly</p>
    <p>$190 mil­lion from their in­vestors. Only $21 mil­lion was re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>There are im­por­tant lessons to be drawn from such cases.</p>
    <p>NO SUCH THING AS A SURE-WIN GOOD IN­VEST­MENT</p>
    <p>Any crook can give you a prom­ise that he can de­liver a re­turn of 50 per cent or more.</p>
    <p>Just pay him $10,000 and he can im­me­di­ately give you back $5,000 as the promised profit.</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, you have just been swin­dled out of $5,000 – this is the hall­mark of the so-called Ponzi scams whose make-be­lieve prof­its are from in­vestors’ own money.</p>
    <p>DON’T BE­LIEVE ANY­THING WITH­OUT CHECK­ING</p>
    <p>With a good graphic artist, it is easy to show po­ten­tial in­vestors that they can build an is­land as big as Sin­ga­pore. If this is true, you should be able to read about this in all the ma­jor news plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Some scam­mers also like to put up pho­to­graphs of them­selves with gov­ern­ment min­is­ters, with</p>
    <p>the in­sid­i­ous in­tent to im­ply that th­ese lead­ers en­dorse their work.</p>
    <p>You should know by now that it is not hard to take pho­tos with min­is­ters when they are out and about. Be­ing oblig­ing to fel­low cit­i­zens over a we­fie does not give any­one the right to mis­use such pho­tos.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, don’t just take re­marks like “as re­ported in The Straits Times” as an en­dorse­ment. Look for the orig­i­nal re­port and de­cide only af­ter you have read it.</p>
    <p>ALL THAT GLIT­TERS IS NOT GOLD</p>
    <p>Don’t be taken in by plush of­fices and big cars, as th­ese are no guar­an­tee of a per­son’s trust­wor­thi­ness.</p>
    <p>A wise sales col­league once told me: “Never drive a big car to meet clients as they will think you can af­ford it be­cause you over­charge them!”</p>
    <p>So be­fore you hand over money to some­one who fits such a de­scrip­tion, you may want to grill that per­son on how ev­ery cent of your money will be spent.</p>
