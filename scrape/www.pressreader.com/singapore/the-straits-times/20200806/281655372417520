    <p>Plans are in the works to bet­ter sup­port mi­grant work­ers’ men­tal health and al­low them more free­dom to leave their dor­mi­to­ries, as a re­cent spate of sui­cides and at­tempted sui­cides raises con­cerns about their men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that while it had not seen a spike in the num­ber of sui­cides among mi­grant work­ers “com­pared to pre­vi­ous years”, it was watch­ing the si­t­u­a­tion closely and work­ing with part­ners and groups to give mi­grant work­ers more men­tal health sup­port.</p>
    <p>In­ci­dents re­ported by me­dia and videos shared on­line have re­newed con­cerns over the men­tal and emo­tional health of work­ers, many of whom have spent the last few months con­fined to their liv­ing quar­ters.</p>
    <p>In some in­stances, work­ers have put them­selves at risk by stand­ing on win­dow or build­ing ledges, or died in their dorms.</p>
    <p>Since May, there have been at least five work­ers de­tained un­der the Men­tal Health Act af­ter at­tempt­ing to hurt them­selves, and at least two re­ported cases of work­ers dy­ing of un­nat­u­ral causes in dorms.</p>
    <p>AC­CESS TO COUN­SELLING</p>
    <p>MOM said its in­ves­ti­ga­tions showed i nci­dents tend to stem from is­sues mi­grant work­ers faced back home, with their mar­riages or fam­i­lies, or un­fore­seen in­ci­dents in their home coun­tries. Work­ers suf­fered dis­tress be­cause they were un­able to re­turn home eas­ily.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it was work­ing on get­ting work­ers back home. “But as there are var­i­ous fac­tors in­volved, such as en­sur­ing that these work­ers have re­cov­ered and have taken a swab test as re­quired by some home coun­tries, we seek em­ploy­ers’ and work­ers’ un­der­stand­ing that it may take some time for work­ers to be able to re­turn home,” it said.</p>
    <p>MOM also said it was work­ing with work­ers’ groups to en­sure they have ac­cess to coun­selling and sup­port, pro­vid­ing work­ers with in­for­ma­tion in a timely man­ner, and find­ing ways to re­duce the time they spend in their rooms.</p>
    <p>The first dorms were iso­lated in early April to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, work­ers stay­ing in the dorms still can­not leave the premises for the most part, even on their rest days.</p>
    <p>Those cleared for work have to re­turn to their dorm im­me­di­ately af­ter work. Since yes­ter­day, how­ever, work­ers have been able to leave their dorms to run spec­i­fied es­sen­tial er­rands, such as med­i­cal ap­point­ments or bank­ing ser­vices, with ap­proval from their em­ploy­ers or dorm op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Stress, caused by quar­an­tines and un­cer­tainty over per­sonal health, fam­i­lies and jobs, has been build­ing up among mi­grant work­ers, non­govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions (NGOs) told ST.</p>
    <p>Many of these groups have been call­ing at­ten­tion to the psy­cho­log­i­cal im­pact of move­ment re­stric­tions on the vul­ner­a­ble and low­paid group since the pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Zaqy Mo­hamad told ST on Tues­day that there will be a “re­lax­ation from the cur­rent po­si­tion” to ex­plore ways for work­ers to safely leave the dorms, for ex­am­ple through stag­gered rest days.</p>
    <p>“These are part of the sup­port we will give as we tran­si­tion to the next stage... We are not ready to re­lease them com­pletely to the com­mu­nity, but you can’t keep them cooped up,” he said.</p>
    <p>MOM said it had stag­gered times for work­ers to leave their rooms to ac­cess com­mon ar­eas, and worked with NGOs to sched­ule ac­tiv­i­ties. For in­stance, HealthServ­e con­ducts ac­tiv­i­ties such as ex­er­cise ses­sions for work­ers stay­ing on cruise ships three times a week.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said that when com­mu­nity and dor­mi­tory cases have been sus­tained at low lev­els for a pe­riod of time, work­ers would be able to leave their dor­mi­to­ries for the recre­ational cen­tres (RCs) “in a mea­sured and safe man­ner”.</p>
    <p>“It is im­per­a­tive for us to man­age not just their per­sonal health with re­gard to Covid-19, but also their men­tal health,” added Mr Zaqy.</p>
    <p>HealthServ­e, the main char­ity here with men­tal health ser­vices for mi­grant work­ers, said it has coun­selled over 700 for­eign work­ers since it launched its vir­tual coun­selling clinic in late April.</p>
    <p>While the num­ber of cases it sees of work­ers in dis­tress has dropped slightly from June to July, the in­ten­sity of the cases has height­ened.</p>
    <p>Its head of com­mu­ni­ca­tions and en­gage­ment, Ms Suwen Low, said: “There are more high-risk cases com­ing to us, which in­clude in­stances of self-harm and sui­cide ideation.”</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING OUT FOR THE DIS­TRESSED</p>
    <p>In the last two weeks, the num­ber of cases which have pre­sented thoughts of sui­cide has tripled, with about 10 per cent be­ing more se­ri­ous, she added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, daily calls to the Mi­grant Work­ers’ Cen­tre helpline have in­creased by three times, said chair­man Yeo Guat Kwang, not­ing that when a caller dis­plays emo­tional or men­tal dis­tress the case is es­ca­lated to pro­fes­sional coun­sel­lors or men­tal health pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>Ms Low said HealthServ­e usu­ally sees the most se­vere mi­grant worker cases. “For work­ers, frus­tra­tions and anx­i­ety have been around since the start, but of course this is made worse by the pro­longed con­fine­ment,” she said.</p>
    <p>Added Ms Low: “For many of them, the ques­tion is ‘when, when can I leave the cruise ship’, ‘when can I leave the dorm’, ‘when can I go back to my coun­try?’”</p>
    <p>Step­ping up vig­i­lance to keep an eye out for work­ers in dis­tress are the For­ward As­sur­ance and Sup­port (Fast) teams, which are teams of po­lice and MOM of­fi­cers and sol­diers de­ployed to the dorms.</p>
    <p>In view of re­cent events, they will as­sess if a worker may ben­e­fit from speak­ing to a men­tal health coun­sel­lor, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>“We have also worked with IMH to train and bet­ter equip front-line staff with the knowl­edge and skills to help work­ers who may re­quire sup­port,” MOM added.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, the min­istry said it had made “con­sid­er­able ef­fort” to keep work­ers up to date on Covid-19-re­lated ef­forts, through daily mes­sages and also ma­te­ri­als in their lan­guages. “These ma­te­ri­als en­cour­age work­ers to iden­tify symp­toms of dis­tress, look out for one an­other, be a buddy to a friend, and know where to seek help,” it said.</p>
    <p>To re­duce the num­ber of work­ers stay­ing in the dorms, some of the 300,000 mi­grant work­ers were housed on cruise ships, in ho­tels, va­cant Hous­ing Board blocks and mil­i­tary camps.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties ex­pect to clear all dorms – save for 17 blocks in eight pur­pose-built dorms – of Covid-19 by the be­gin­ning of this month, and as of Tues­day, nine in 10, or about 273,000 work­ers, have been given the all-clear.</p>
    <p>In June, amend­ments were made to for­eign man­power rules that cod­i­fied cer­tain pro­to­cols re­lated to work­ers stay­ing in the dorms, in­clud­ing the need for em­ploy­ers to en­sure they have ac­cess to food and ne­ces­si­ties and also the need for em­ployer con­sent should a worker need to leave the dorm.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter in par­tic­u­lar caused con­cern among NGOs like the Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nom­ics (Home) and Tran­sient Work­ers Count Too (TWC2), and former Nom­i­nated MP Anthea Ong.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment, the trio along with other groups said the changes would “neg­a­tively im­pact work­ers’ al­ready wors­en­ing men­tal health” and said the re­stric­tions would be an added chal­lenge for the men.</p>
    <p>“The volatile eco­nomic si­t­u­a­tion has made it nec­es­sary for work­ers to seek fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to meet ba­sic needs, ob­tain em­ploy­ment ad­vice and look for new jobs. Re­strict­ing their mo­bil­ity will make it more chal­leng­ing for them to seek help and pro­tect their liveli­hoods,” said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Still, even if work­ers are al­lowed to re­turn to work and what likely will be a muted form of recre­ational ac­tiv­i­ties on their rest days, psy­chi­a­trist Lim Boon Leng said it might not re­solve their anx­i­eties.</p>
    <p>He said the ma­jor­ity will be all right but there will be some who will face dif­fi­cul­ties ad­just­ing.</p>
    <p>“There might be a mi­nor­ity who may have lapsed into de­pres­sive or anx­i­ety dis­or­ders. There is the need to make sure they re­ceive the proper treat­ment for this,” he said.</p>
    <p>STEP­PING UP CARE We have also worked with IMH to train and bet­ter equip front­line staff with the knowl­edge and skills to help work­ers who may re­quire sup­port. ’’ THE MIN­ISTRY OF MAN­POWER</p>
