    <p>The re­cent par­lia­men­tary de­bate on whether to ban res­i­dents from smok­ing near win­dows or on their bal­conies is im­por­tant, for ar­gu­ments at its heart cen­tre on pri­vate rights ver­sus public health. Smok­ing costs and harms are real, and it is time to se­ri­ously con­sider new ways to curb smok­ing, says Pro­fes­sor Eus­ton Quah.</p>
    <p>The re­cent par­lia­men­tary de­bate on whether to ban res­i­dents from smok­ing near win­dows or on their bal­conies is im­por­tant, for ar­gu­ments at its heart cen­tre on pri­vate rights ver­sus public health.</p>
    <p>Public health poli­cies have gained mo­men­tum in re­duc­ing the num­ber of smok­ers over time, so this must be kept up and eval­u­ated for greater ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>As for pri­vate rights, eco­nom­ics tells us that pri­vate trans­ac­tions can have neg­a­tive ex­ter­nal ef­fects on third par­ties. For ex­am­ple, pol­lut­ing the air and wa­ter­ways and cre­at­ing a high vol­ume of noise or con­ges­tion harm oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The eas­i­est so­lu­tion is to com­pel the per­pe­tra­tors to pay for their ac­tions and to re­ward ben­e­fi­cial ac­tiv­i­ties by some means of com­pen­sa­tion or sub­sidy.</p>
    <p>Seen this way, there is no case for pri­vacy pro­tec­tion ar­gu­ments here for smok­ing at bal­conies and win­dows, as it clearly pol­lutes the sur­round­ing clean air of neigh­bours. Neigh­bours have a right to clean air and they should be com­pen­sated for hav­ing to bear the con­se­quences of neigh­bour­ing smok­ers foul­ing the qual­ity of their air. This is akin to dam­age sus­tained in an ac­ci­dent and claims are made for com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The big ob­sta­cle is the im­ple­men­ta­tion of laws to elicit com­pen­sa­tion and de­ter­min­ing the amount.</p>
    <p>SO­CIAL COST OF SMOK­ING</p>
    <p>First, let us con­sider the costs. In the lat­est study on the so­cial cost of smok­ing in Sin­ga­pore, pub­lished in the Bri­tish Med­i­cal Jour­nal (Open Ac­cess) in 2017, this was es­ti­mated to be about US$480 mil­lion in 2014. The re­search re­lied on al­most the same method­ol­ogy I had used in my Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Jour­nal pa­per in 2002, which was the first study on the costs of smok­ing on health in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, there’s been a re­vival among ado­les­cents in tak­ing up smok­ing. As well, the pro­por­tion of fe­male to male smok­ers is ris­ing, although male smok­ers still dom­i­nate. No one knows why this is so, but we can spec­u­late that it might be due to peer pres­sure, in­creas­ing cu­rios­ity to ex­per­i­ment and the need to be per­ceived as “cool”.</p>
    <p>Much has been done to curb smok­ing, such as rais­ing the le­gal age for do­ing so and dis­cour­ag­ing the pur­chase of to­bacco prod­ucts through var­i­ous means such as re­mov­ing ad­ver­tise­ments, en­sur­ing plain pack­ag­ing, and us­ing high pric­ing and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The new ques­tion is: Can more be done, es­pe­cially in view of the lat­est con­tro­versy in­volv­ing sec­ond-hand smoke?</p>
    <p>The neg­a­tive health ef­fects of smok­ing are sub­stan­tial and well doc­u­mented. Smok­ing is re­spon­si­ble for a wide ar­ray of ill­nesses, in­clud­ing cancer, heart dis­ease, stroke, res­pi­ra­tory and chronic lung dis­eases. There is ev­i­dence that mor­tal­ity in­creases with the amount smoked and the length of smok­ing over one’s life.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-hand smoke has also been iden­ti­fied by most med­i­cal au­thor­i­ties, in­clud­ing the United States Depart­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, as con­tribut­ing to the death rates of non-smok­ers. A 2018 study placed sec­ond-hand smoke as con­tribut­ing to one in eight deaths world­wide and one in six in the case of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There are also sig­nif­i­cant losses in pro­duc­tiv­ity aris­ing from smok­ing:</p>
    <p>Smok­ers tend to be sick more of­ten than non-smok­ers do­ing sim­i­lar work. A Swedish study showed that smok­ers take on av­er­age 7.7 more sick days an­nu­ally than non-smok­ing col­leagues.</p>
    <p>• They re­quire smok­ing breaks dur­ing their work days and this can dis­rupt the flow of work, not only for them­selves but also for their col­leagues.</p>
    <p>• Sec­ond-hand smoke causes dis­com­fort and ir­ri­ta­tion to non-smok­ing col­leagues, and this may af­fect their work per­for­mance and lower their pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>• Smok­ers are more likely to fall ill, at times with se­ri­ous ill­nesses, and this may re­quire more home care by fam­ily mem­bers which will, in turn, dis­rupt their own pro­duc­tive work.</p>
    <p>The ar­gu­ment that it is none of the busi­ness of non-smok­ers to curb smok­ing as the costs are borne by smok­ers them­selves is wrong.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ety bears a huge bur­den, both from health­care costs and pro­duc­tiv­ity losses.</p>
    <p>Health­care costs in­volve not just costs to smok­ers but also to non-smok­ers. Of­ten, since med­i­cal and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion sub­si­dies are paid for by tax­pay­ers, it is not only smok­ers but also non-smok­ers who pay.</p>
    <p>WHAT CAN BE DONE?</p>
    <p>One way is to use pric­ing from the eco­nom­ics tool­kit to change be­hav­iour; in this in­stance, one may want to con­sider a two-tier pric­ing sys­tem for the pay­ment of con­ser­vancy and other fees. The hous­ing man­age­ment, or Hous­ing Board, may con­sider re­quir­ing a house­hold dec­la­ra­tion of whether there are smok­ers. That in­for­ma­tion is stored and house­holds with smok­ers will be re­quired to pay a higher con­ser­vancy and fee charge.</p>
    <p>At any point, when the smok­ing house­holds cease smok­ing for at least a full year or more, they would re­vert to the nor­mal con­ser­vancy charges.</p>
    <p>This pro­posal will func­tion like an emis­sion tax with a levied price for smok­ing, ex­cept that it will not vary by the amount smoked or by the num­ber of smok­ers in a house­hold. It is in­stead a sim­ple flat rate on the smok­ing house­hold.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies will need to be done on what should be the price of smok­ing, as well as the penalty for a false dec­la­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>It might be ar­gued, how­ever, that it would be chal­leng­ing to mon­i­tor and catch a cul­prit smoker. Eco­nom­ics sug­gests that since the prob­a­bil­ity of get­ting caught is low, then the penalty will have to be high to de­ter po­ten­tial cul­prits.</p>
    <p>The point is that we need to cre­ate a dis­in­cen­tive for smok­ing in and within res­i­den­tial ar­eas, sim­i­lar to those for vi­o­la­tions such as lit­ter­ing and other un­wanted be­hav­iours.</p>
    <p>An­other more im­me­di­ate and sim­ple so­lu­tion is to have more signs at strate­gic places in hous­ing es­tates to re­mind smok­ing res­i­dents to be aware of their neigh­bours. Hope­fully, it will cause be­havioural changes in smok­ers through greater peer pres­sure from so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>NO EASY SO­LU­TIONS</p>
    <p>The burn­ing is­sue here is not about ac­cept­ing the less salu­bri­ous ef­fects of com­mu­nal liv­ing, nor is it about give-and-take sit­u­a­tions. It is about in­flict­ing costs on oth­ers. Non-smok­ers suf­fer both short-term and long-term tan­gi­ble health costs. These af­fect both the health sta­tus and pro­duc­tiv­ity of a na­tion.</p>
    <p>And, un­like trans­bound­ary air pol­lu­tion from the burn­ing of forests caus­ing eco­nomic and health dam­age to neigh­bour­ing coun­tries, smok­ing in homes is within a coun­try’s le­gal ju­ris­dic­tion and so can be stopped.</p>
    <p>Me­di­a­tion, ed­u­ca­tion and public cam­paigns will help, but these re­me­dial pol­icy ac­tions have been around for a long time and, mean­while, the cost of smok­ing con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>It is time to se­ri­ously con­sider other mea­sures and think out­side the box. Smok­ing costs and harms are real, and these should be ad­dressed more strin­gently.</p>
