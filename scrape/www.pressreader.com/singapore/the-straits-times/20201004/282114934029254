    <p>PARIS • Ger­man qual­i­fier Daniel Alt­maier, ranked 186th in the world, bun­dled out Ital­ian sev­enth seed Mat­teo Ber­ret­tini from the French Open with a com­pre­hen­sive 6-2, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 vic­tory yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old was not even sure he would make his de­but at the clay-court Grand Slam as he was strug­gling with an in­jury and needed a go-ahead from a doc­tor at the last minute to take part in the qual­i­fiers.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Alt­maier picked up the big­gest win in his nascent ca­reer on at Roland Gar­ros’ Court Philippe Cha­trier by de­feat­ing the world No. 8 Ber­ret­tini, hav­ing also beaten Feli­ciano Lopez and JanLen­nard Struff in his pre­vi­ous rounds.</p>
    <p>“It’s my first time on this court and play­ing in Paris, I’m delighted to be in the fourth round,” Alt­maier said in an on-court in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“My coach and I have been work­ing so hard to be here, and while I’ve strug­gled with a few in­juries, I am su­per pleased it’s at Roland Gar­ros.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore qual­i­fy­ing, I was strug­gling with an in­jury, so I wasn’t sure I was go­ing to play. I hope the crowd and the TV au­di­ence en­joyed watch­ing, as I want to en­ter­tain.”</p>
    <p>He be­came the fourth man to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam as a qual­i­fier after Lee Hyung­taik (2000 US Open), David Gof­fin (2012 French Open) and Juan Ig­na­cio Lon­dero (2019 French Open).</p>
    <p>Alt­maier broke the off-colour Ital­ian’s serve four times to win their first ca­reer meet­ing in two hours and 15 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“Pretty up­set. I was re­ally feel­ing bad on the court. I’m feel­ing bad now,” said Ber­ret­tini.</p>
    <p>“Didn’t play well in the big stage. It’s painful. But I guess that’s ten­nis.</p>
    <p>“For me, I felt the con­di­tions were pretty heavy. I tried to fight. I tried to play with what I had, but wasn’t enough. I think he re­ally de­served the win.”</p>
    <p>Alt­maier hit 23 win­ners, many of them came from his siz­zling one­handed back­hand, while Ber­ret­tini’s pow­er­ful game lacked con­trol as he dished up 42 un­forced er­rors, the last of them on match point.</p>
    <p>Alt­maier will meet US Open semi-fi­nal­ist Pablo Carreno Busta in the fourth round. The Spa­niard beat his com­pa­triot Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4.</p>
    <p>In an­other third-round match, Ste­fanos Tsitsipas de­feated Al­jaz Be­dene via a walkover. The Greek star was lead­ing 6-1, 6-2, 3-1.</p>
