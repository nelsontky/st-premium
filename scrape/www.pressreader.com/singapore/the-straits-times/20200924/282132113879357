    <p>From to­day, su­per­mar­ket chain Gi­ant will lower the prices of 650 daily es­sen­tials for six months by 20 per cent, on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>It will also re­fresh its brand, with its 53 Sin­ga­pore stores in­cor­po­rat­ing new fea­tures in­clud­ing in­store bak­eries and Guardian phar­ma­cies.</p>
    <p>The price re­duc­tion is cost­ing Gi­ant around $17 mil­lion and is prompted by its con­sumer re­search find­ing that cost of liv­ing con­cerns are top on peo­ple’s minds dur­ing the on­go­ing pan­demic, said Dairy Farm’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer for its South-east Asia food busi­ness Chris Bush yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The one thing that they told us loud and clear is they would like cheaper prices, they’d like greater value and they’d also like more stable prices, par­tic­u­larly on those es­sen­tial prod­ucts that they buy most of­ten,” he told re­porters dur­ing a me­dia con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The price re­duc­tions will ap­ply to prod­ucts across Gi­ant’s own brands, fresh prod­ucts as well as national brands like Dove.</p>
    <p>Van­namei prawns, for ex­am­ple, will be sold for $1 per 100g, down from $1.89 pre­vi­ously. A box of 50 green tea bags by OSK will re­tail for $5, down from $6.95.</p>
    <p>About 2,000 new prod­ucts have also been added to Gi­ant’s stores, along with such fea­tures as $1 zones and stalls sell­ing fried chicken.</p>
    <p>Only its hy­per­mar­kets in Tampines and IMM will have the full range of new of­fer­ings, owing to space con­straints.</p>
    <p>Gi­ant’s move to make es­sen­tials more af­ford­able fol­lows FairPrice’s price freeze of 100 house brand items, which be­gan in March last year and will run un­til the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Asked if it was in­flu­enced by FairPrice’s price freeze and foray into the hy­per­mar­ket for­mat, Mr Bush said Gi­ant’s plans are based on cus­tomer feedback and not a re­sponse to any par­tic­u­lar com­peti­tor.</p>
    <p>The clo­sure of sev­eral of Gi­ant’s big­ger stores in re­cent years – in­clud­ing those at VivoCity and Park­way Pa­rade – are part of the group’s nor­mal busi­ness re­view and leas­ing ar­range­ments, he added.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery now and again, un­for­tu­nately, we need to close some stores, but at the same time, we open a lot of stores. So I wouldn’t read any­thing more into that.”</p>
    <p>Be­yond the phys­i­cal re­vamp, Gi­ant is also work­ing on im­prov­ing store op­er­a­tions, hy­giene stan­dards, prod­uct avail­abil­ity and ser­vice lev­els, he said.</p>
    <p>The $17 mil­lion it will forgo in cut­ting prices is largely funded from the sav­ings amassed from higher pro­duc­tiv­ity and sup­ply chain ef­fi­cien­cies, he added, de­clin­ing to dis­close the to­tal cost of its re­brand­ing ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Yik Hun, mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor of South-East Asia Food at Dairy Farm Group, said Gi­ant hopes to main­tain the price re­duc­tions be­yond the six-month com­mit­ment.</p>
    <p>“The only way we can do it is to get the vol­ume and sup­port from our sup­plier part­ners,” he added.</p>
