    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic may have stopped mixed mar­tial arts pro­mo­tion One Cham­pi­onship from hold­ing large-scale fights, but the com­pany has fig­ured out how the show can go on – dig­i­tally.</p>
    <p>Be­sides live-streaming fights so that fans can tune in from wherever they are, the Singapore-based firm is work­ing on tak­ing the dig­i­tal ex­pe­ri­ence to the next level by of­fer­ing data-driven in­sights for view­ers as they stream live shows.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, sta­tis­tics could be dis­played on-screen in real time show­ing the speed of a par­tic­u­lar punch or kick.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is also ex­plor­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of other cut­tingedge con­cepts, such as the use of holo­graphic com­put­ing to help ath­letes vi­su­alise fights so as to pre­vent in­juries dur­ing train­ing.</p>
    <p>These are just some of the ben­e­fits of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion for One Cham­pi­onship to make its of­fer­ings more im­mer­sive in re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus, which has halted live sport­ing events with spec­ta­tor crowds.</p>
    <p>One Cham­pi­onship is among nearly three-quar­ters of Singapore’s or­gan­i­sa­tions that are ac­cel­er­at­ing their pace of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion due to the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to new sur­vey re­sults jointly re­leased yes­ter­day by tech gi­ant Mi­crosoft and mar­ket re­search firm IDC Asi­aPa­cific.</p>
    <p>Con­ducted in two phases – first in De­cem­ber last year and Jan­uary this year (“pre-Covid”), and then again in July (“since Covid”) – the study sur­veyed 202 busi­ness de­ci­sion-mak­ers and 219 work­ers in Singapore.</p>
    <p>Re­spon­dents were from var­i­ous sec­tors, in­clud­ing health­care, man­u­fac­tur­ing, bank­ing and re­tail.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft Singapore man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Kevin Wo told The Straits Times: “With the pan­demic and the eco­nomic cri­sis it has brought, all of us are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing new chal­lenges and changes at a speed and scale that we’ve not had to ad­dress be­fore.”</p>
    <p>About 80 per cent of the firms sur­veyed in July said that in­no­va­tion is crit­i­cal to strat­egy suc­cess, up from the 67 per cent in phase one.</p>
    <p>“In­no­va­tion is no longer an op­tion, but es­sen­tial to sur­vival and suc­cess,” said Mr Wo.</p>
    <p>The re­port said that be­ing forced to in­no­vate quickly amid the pan­demic has made firms re­alise that it was not as chal­leng­ing as they had ex­pected.</p>
    <p>More than half of the com­pa­nies said in July that they found it eas­ier to drive in­no­va­tion, up from the 31 per cent be­fore Covid-19 hit.</p>
    <p>Some of the fac­tors cited as ma­jor in­no­va­tion block­ers be­fore the out­break were cul­ture, i nno­va­tion mind­set and fear of fail­ure.</p>
    <p>Mr Wo said: “Or­gan­i­sa­tions had to switch to dig­i­tal as the pan­demic pro­vided a strong im­pe­tus for them to act im­me­di­ately, so what­ever bar­ri­ers they had pre­vi­ously had to be re­moved. Pre-Covid, or­gan­i­sa­tions in Singapore al­ways had dig­i­tal on their agenda, but their ap­proach to in­no­va­tion was more of an evolved jour­ney – ex­per­i­ment­ing and ad­just­ing along the way.”</p>
    <p>The study also in­tro­duced the Cul­ture of In­no­va­tion Frame­work, which as­sesses a com­pany’s ap­proach to in­no­va­tion by look­ing at peo­ple, process, data and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, Singapore firms scored the low­est in the peo­ple cat­e­gory, which looks at in­di­ca­tors such as skilling ini­tia­tives and hav­ing a di­verse work­force.</p>
    <p>Mr Wo said: “The re­al­ity is that tech­nol­ogy on its own will not make a dif­fer­ence – it is peo­ple who will al­low or­gan­i­sa­tions to in­no­vate and trans­form.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies must not only in­vest in tech­nol­ogy, but also in­vest in hu­man cap­i­tal so as to cul­ti­vate a work­place cul­ture that en­cour­ages in­no­va­tion and em­braces dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.”</p>

Be&#xAD;sides live streams, the com&#xAD;pany is also work&#xAD;ing on of&#xAD;fer&#xAD;ing data-driven in&#xAD;sights for view&#xAD;ers, for ex&#xAD;am&#xAD;ple, by dis&#xAD;play&#xAD;ing the speed of a punch or kick on-screen in real time.</p>
