    <p>Malaysia’s op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim’s plan to un­seat Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin has fi­nally un­rav­elled. But that does not mean the Prime Min­is­ter is in the clear. Sev­eral chal­lenges still await him in the com­ing weeks, start­ing with Bud­get 2021 which is set to be tabled on Nov 6.</p>
    <p>A month after op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim first claimed to have a “for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity” of Malaysia’s Par­lia­ment, the Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) pres­i­dent’s un­likely plan to un­seat Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin has fi­nally un­rav­elled.</p>
    <p>Umno pres­i­dent Zahid Hamidi re­treated on Wed­nes­day from threats to quit Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s govern­ment, call­ing in­stead for a po­lit­i­cal cease­fire among par­ties which form the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact.</p>
    <p>But it also meant a sur­ren­der by de­fault for Datuk Seri An­war, who went to the Palace on Oct 13 in the be­lief that Zahid and for­mer premier Na­jib Razak’s joint back­ing would de­liver enough MPs to take con­trol of the 222-strong fed­eral leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>Yet the huge blow to the cred­i­bil­ity of Mr An­war – who has failed on at least four coup at­tempts now in the past 12 years – does not mean the prime min­is­ter is in the clear. The Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia leader has run the gaunt­let in the eight months he has been premier, but sev­eral chal­lenges still await him in the com­ing weeks, start­ing with</p>
    <p>Bud­get 2021 which is set to be tabled on Nov 6.</p>
    <p>“An­war may have suf­fered a ma­jor set­back, but the cease­fire doesn’t mean Muhyid­din’s night­mare is over. The PM still needs to face Par­lia­ment for Bud­get 2021.</p>
    <p>“With a ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity, the govern­ment is in con­stant ne­go­ti­a­tions to re­main in power,” risk con­sul­tants BowerGroup­Asia’s di­rec­tor Adib Zalkapli told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>It is barely a happy camp as Umno, PN’s largest com­po­nent, has been com­plain­ing vo­cif­er­ously in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Just a hand­ful of rene­gades would bring the rul­ing al­liance be­low a sim­ple ma­jor­ity – it stood at 113 un­til the re­cent po­lit­i­cal im­broglio – and po­ten­tially de­feat the bud­get.</p>
    <p>By con­ven­tion, the fail­ure to pass a sup­ply Bill to fund the govern­ment is akin to a no-con­fi­dence mo­tion that would re­sult in the col­lapse of the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>PKR, in a curt re­sponse, said it “notes and re­spects” Zahid’s pledge to back the PN govern­ment amid a resur­gent coro­n­avirus out­break in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>“We will main­tain ef­forts to­wards restor­ing the public man­date with MPs who have the same goals and hope, which is to cor­rect the di­rec­tion of the na­tion’s lead­er­ship,” sec­re­tary-gen­eral Sai­fud­din Na­su­tion said in a press re­lease on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>A con­tin­ued as­sault on Mr Muhyid­din by the op­po­si­tion led by Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) leaves the govern­ment’s sta­bil­ity an on­go­ing con­cern.</p>
    <p>But Mr An­war’s own cal­cu­lus to fi­nally as­cend to the high­est of­fice, after be­ing sacked from govern­ment over two decades ago, re­mains a puz­zle.</p>
    <p>When the PH chief first de­clared on Sept 23 that he had the num­bers, only Zahid among the PN ranks openly ad­mit­ted “many MPs” out of Umno’s 39 were con­sid­er­ing</p>
    <p>back­ing the for­mer deputy premier, while other fac­tions quickly dis­as­so­ci­ated them­selves.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP), which has 42 out of PH’s 91 MPs, then warned it would not work with an Umno led by Zahid or Na­jib.</p>
    <p>The duo are bat­tling dozens of graft charges, with im­me­di­ate past Umno pres­i­dent Na­jib al­ready ap­peal­ing a 12-year sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, Mr Muhyid­din’s Malay-Mus­lim al­lies – Umno and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) – have also per­sis­tently ac­cused the Chi­nese-dom­i­nated DAP and Mr An­war of un­der­min­ing the in­ter­ests of Malaysia’s ma­jor­ity com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Even non-Malay PN mem­bers such as the Malaysian Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tion and Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak – the coali­tion which rules the eastern state – said they could not co­op­er­ate with DAP.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported on Tues­day that Zahid’s will­ing­ness to deal with Mr An­war, even as lever­age to ne­go­ti­ate for a bet­ter deal from PM Muhyid­din, re­sulted in back­lash from PAS and Ber­satu as well as a large seg­ment of Umno’s lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>“Zahid was told to walk out if he wants to get in bed with DAP,” a PN of­fi­cial with knowl­edge of the dis­cus­sions told ST.</p>
    <p>How Mr An­war planned to rec­on­cile these stark dif­fer­ences re­mains un­clear, as the 73-year-old played his cards so close to his chest that not just PH al­lies but even se­nior PKR of­fi­cials were kept in the dark.</p>
    <p>This leaves a hung Par­lia­ment, and sub­se­quent fresh elec­tions a likely re­sult, should Mr Muhyid­din fail to pass a bud­get.</p>
    <p>De­spite new record highs of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in re­cent days, some an­a­lysts and Umno in­sid­ers say a hand­ful of dis­grun­tled MPs could still force the is­sue in the be­lief that blame for trig­ger­ing elec­tions dur­ing a pan­demic would not se­verely im­pact their chances of suc­cess.</p>
    <p>But even if snap polls are avoided dur­ing the bud­get sit­ting which ends in De­cem­ber, Mr Muhyid­din’s al­lies still want a vote to be held soon after the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus wave is un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s camp may yet con­sider their failed coup a suc­cess as the premier needs to con­tain not just the Covid-19 out­break, but soothe fes­ter­ing wounds in his in­creas­ingly frac­tious govern­ment.</p>
    <p>NIGHT­MARE MAY NOT BE OVER An­war may have suf­fered a ma­jor set­back, but the cease­fire doesn’t mean Muhyid­din’s night­mare is over. The PM still needs to face Par­lia­ment for Bud­get 2021. With a ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity, the govern­ment is in con­stant ne­go­ti­a­tions to re­main in power.
