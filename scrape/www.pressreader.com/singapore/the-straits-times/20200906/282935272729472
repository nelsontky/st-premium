    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s mul­ti­cul­tural so­ci­ety lays the foun­da­tions for its cit­i­zens to thrive and hold their own on the in­ter­na­tional stage, says bank ex­ec­u­tive Jolynn Wong.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old, who has been work­ing abroad for the last two years, ex­plains: “(It) helps us nav­i­gate chal­leng­ing, fast-chang­ing sit­u­a­tions with di­verse stake­hold­ers.”</p>
    <p>Ms Wong worked in sev­eral re­gional roles in her first eight years at DBS Bank, which gave her the op­por­tu­nity to visit its over­seas mar­kets fre­quently.</p>
    <p>But while those pro­vided good ex­po­sure, noth­ing com­pares to be­ing in the thick of things when posted over­seas, liv­ing in the lo­cal cul­ture and with the lo­cal way of do­ing busi­ness, she says.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong, who is not mar­ried, moved to In­dia in 2018, where she worked in a busi­ness de­vel­op­ment role and led a team of over 100 re­la­tion­ship man­agers</p>
    <p>across 12 cities.</p>
    <p>She re­lo­cated to Hong Kong last Oc­to­ber and took up a new role as an ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor for global trans­ac­tion ser­vices at DBS’ op­er­a­tions there.</p>
    <p>“The ex­pe­ri­ence of work­ing in a di­verse coun­try such as In­dia, where each one of the 28 states has its own com­plex­i­ties, or a glob­ally con­nected city like Hong Kong, has re­ally taught me to be more adapt­able and ver­sa­tile,” Ms Wong says.</p>
    <p>While com­ing from Sin­ga­pore has given her a leg-up in some as­pects, she ac­knowl­edges that there are, of course, ar­eas where Sin­ga­pore­ans can do bet­ter.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Sin­ga­pore­ans can be per­ceived as be­ing too po­lite to speak up.</p>
    <p>But there are ways to put your thoughts across clearly and tact­fully, she says.</p>
    <p>Be­ing Sin­ga­porean also means that peo­ple tend to trust you “a lit­tle more from the out­set”, Ms Wong says, be­cause of the strength of the Repub­lic’s global rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“This is an ad­van­tage we should not take for granted and squan­der, and as Sin­ga­pore­ans work­ing over­seas, we all have a part to play in up­hold­ing the Sin­ga­pore brand.”</p>
