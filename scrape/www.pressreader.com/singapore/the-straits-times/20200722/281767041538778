    <p>PETALING JAYA • From Fri­day, people en­ter­ing Malaysia from over­seas will have to un­dergo their manda­tory quar­an­tine at ho­tels or quar­an­tine cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob, who is also De­fence Min­is­ter, yes­ter­day said this re­quire­ment ap­plies to Malaysians and non-cit­i­zens granted en­try to the country, and that they will have to bear the full cost of their stay.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, those who test neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus upon ar­rival can choose to serve their 14-day quar­an­tine at home. But this op­tion will no longer be avail­able from Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The new rule comes amid ris­ing Covid-19 cases af­ter Malaysia eased its shut­down mea­sures on June 10, al­low­ing busi­nesses and most social ac­tiv­i­ties to re­sume but with social dis­tanc­ing pro­to­cols in place.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, five cases were de­tected in the “Nov­gorod clus­ter”, which orig­i­nated from a Malaysian who had re­turned from Rus­sia on July 5.</p>
    <p>He had tested neg­a­tive for the virus on ar­rival, but later tested pos­i­tive on a sec­ond test.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Is­mail Sabri also said the po­lice will no longer just ad­vise or warn those who flout social dis­tanc­ing rules un­der the re­cov­ery phase of the country’s move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO).</p>
    <p>“Many people seem to as­sume that there are no laws in place, as if the MCO has ended,” he said. “The po­lice have de­cided that there will be no more warn­ings and advice. They will take stern ac­tion against any­one who vi­o­lates the MCO.”</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, po­lice de­tained 80 in­di­vid­u­als for vi­o­lat­ing the MCO – of which 20 were re­manded, four re­leased on bail, and an­other 56 fined.</p>
    <p>Malaysia recorded 15 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, lift­ing the to­tal to 8,815 cases while deaths re­mained at 123.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s was the third straight daily double-digit rise in in­fec­tions, af­ter the country man­aged to hold daily growth to sin­gle dig­its since move­ment con­trols were eased.</p>
