    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Amer­ica’s na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser on Fri­day said the US Coast Guard (USCG) was bas­ing en­hanced re­sponse cut­ters in the western Pa­cific for mar­itime se­cu­rity mis­sions, cit­ing il­le­gal fish­ing and ha­rass­ment of ves­sels by China.</p>
    <p>Mr Robert O’Brien also said the Coast Guard planned to eval­u­ate in the next fis­cal year a fea­si­bil­ity of bas­ing fast re­sponse cut­ters i n Amer­i­can Samoa in the South Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>His state­ment de­scribed the United States as a Pa­cific power and added that China’s “il­le­gal, un­re­ported and un­reg­u­lated fish­ing, and ha­rass­ment of ves­sels op­er­at­ing in the ex­clu­sive eco­nomic zones of other coun­tries in the Indo-Pa­cific threat­ens our sovereignt­y, as well as the sovereignt­y of our Pa­cific neigh­bours and en­dan­gers re­gional sta­bil­ity”.</p>
    <p>He said US ef­forts, in­clud­ing by the Coast Guard, were “crit­i­cal to coun­ter­ing th­ese desta­bil­is­ing and ma­lign ac­tions”. “To that end, the USCG is strate­gi­cally home port­ing sig­nif­i­cantly en­hanced fast re­sponse cut­ters... in the western Pa­cific,” he added, with­out de­tail­ing where the ves­sels would be based or how many were in­volved.</p>
    <p>Mr O’Brien said the new-gen­er­a­tion Coast Guard ves­sels would con­duct mar­itime se­cu­rity mis­sions, such as fish­ery pa­trols, and en­hance mar­itime-do­main aware­ness and en­force­ment ef­forts in col­lab­o­ra­tion with “re­gional part­ners who have lim­ited off­shore sur­veil­lance and en­force­ment ca­pac­ity”.</p>
    <p>“En­hanc­ing the pres­ence of the USCG in the Indo-Pa­cific en­sures the United States will re­main the mar­itime part­ner of choice in the re­gion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Coast Guard did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment. The state­ment comes just ahead of a planned visit to Asia by US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo.</p>
    <p>He led a meet­ing of for­eign min­is­ters from In­dia, Ja­pan and Aus­tralia this month in Tokyo, a group­ing that Wash­ing­ton hopes to de­velop as a bul­wark against China’s grow­ing as­sertive­ness and ex­ten­sive mar­itime claims in the re­gion, in­clud­ing most of the strate­gic South China Sea.</p>
    <p>The US Navy reg­u­larly angers China by con­duct­ing what it calls “free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion” op­er­a­tions close to some of the is­lands China oc­cu­pies and which are also claimed by other states.</p>
    <p>Mr O’Brien’s an­nounce­ment comes less than two weeks ahead of a Nov 3 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, in which Mr Don­ald Trump’s cam­paign has made a tough ap­proach to China a ma­jor for­eign-pol­icy theme to help him se­cure a sec­ond term in of­fice.</p>
