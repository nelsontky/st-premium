    <p>Ja­panese gam­ing spe­cial­ist Dig­i­tal En­ter­tain­ment As­set (DEA) has set up op­er­a­tions in Sin­ga­pore to roll out re­gional on­line gam­ing – or e-gam­ing – that will run on its pro­pri­etary blockchain plat­form.</p>
    <p>Founded by techno­preneur Naohito Yoshida, DEA will use its PlayMin­ing plat­form to of­fer re­gional gamers ac­cess to games and dig­i­tal art col­lec­tions as well as the abil­ity to in­ter­act with Ja­panese manga char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr Yoshida told The Straits Times that DEA’s of­fer­ings stand apart from the com­pe­ti­tion as it en­ables users to earn cryp­tocur­rency, which can ul­ti­mately be con­verted to cash.</p>
    <p>“I am very ex­cited to merge gam­ing and an­i­ma­tion with blockchain tech­nol­ogy as this will be the cusp of a new in­dus­try of the fu­ture,” said Mr Yoshida, who is now based in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The PlayMin­ing plat­form uses DEAP­coins, a cryp­tocur­rency minted on Aug 29 last year and now traded on in­ter­na­tional cryp­tocur­rency ex­changes like OKEx (Hong Kong), Bithumb Global (South Korea), Bit­trex Global (Euro­pean Union), In­do­dax (In­done­sia) and DigiFinex (Hong Kong).</p>
    <p>Mr Yoshida, pop­u­larly known as Goro-san in e-gam­ing cir­cles, is also the founder of three listed com­pa­nies on the Tokyo Stock Ex­change – Cele­brix, Za­paras and Eole. He is the chair­man of Eole.</p>
    <p>But he now sees a huge po­ten­tial for e-gam­ing in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is of­fi­cially launch­ing its blockchain-based JobTribes manga game in the In­done­sian mar­ket next month.</p>
    <p>Mr Yoshida re­vealed that the soft launch it­self had al­ready gar­nered a fol­low­ing of more than 100,000 around the re­gion, with half from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>He reck­ons that much of this en­thu­si­asm has been driven by the po­ten­tial to earn ex­tra in­come.</p>
    <p>“We pro­vide our en­ter­tain­ment con­tent for free, and what you earn in the game can be used in real life. It pro­vides a real in­come op­por­tu­nity for the gamer,” he said.</p>
    <p>Un­der PlayMin­ing’s Play and Earn scheme, users play games free to earn DEAP­coins that can be used to ei­ther power up their games or pur­chase dig­i­tal art.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal art can be traded on DEA’s blockchain-based plat­form – DEA Dig­i­tal Art Auc­tion – and ul­ti­mately turned into cash.</p>
    <p>Mr Yoshida reck­ons his games could at­tract two mil­lion users by early next year.</p>
    <p>Fuelling DEA’s re­gional am­bi­tion and op­ti­mism is the fact that the global on­line gam­ing mar­ket of more than 2.7 bil­lion gamers is grow­ing ex­po­nen­tially, ac­cord­ing to e-sport and gam­ing an­a­lyt­ics web­site New­zoo.</p>
    <p>To­tal global spend­ing by gamers this year is ex­pected to be US$159.3 bil­lion (S$216.4 bil­lion), with the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion ac­count­ing for 55 per cent, or US$87 bil­lion, of that rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Glob­alWe­bIn­dex notes that more than one bil­lion peo­ple world­wide stream games over the In­ter­net each month and an­other one bil­lion peo­ple watch live streams of other peo­ple play­ing games each month.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try in­sid­ers reckon that the amal­ga­ma­tion of blockchain tech­nol­ogy with gam­ing holds huge po­ten­tial for the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The blockchain plat­form sup­ports de­cen­tralised as­set ex­changes, ver­i­fi­able scarcity of vir­tual ob­jects and col­lectibles as well as fast and se­cure pay­ment net­works, while also en­abling de­vel­op­ers to mon­e­tise their cre­ations.</p>
    <p>Global tech­nol­ogy names like Google, Ten­cent, Sony and Nin­tendo have also started to in­vest heav­ily in gam­ing.</p>
    <p>While de­vel­op­ing its South-east Asian mar­ket from its Sin­ga­pore base, Mr Yoshida said DEA is look­ing for­ward to ex­pand­ing into In­dia be­cause of that coun­try’s huge mar­ket po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>DEA is also con­sid­er­ing list­ing its cryp­tocur­rency on ex­changes in In­dia, the Philip­pines, Tai­wan and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Mr Yoshida said he is seek­ing in­vestors in South-east Asia to part­ner DEA as it rapidly rolls out its op­er­a­tions through the re­gion.</p>
    <p>We pro­vide our en­ter­tain­ment con­tent for free, and what you earn in the game can be used in real life. It pro­vides a real in­come op­por­tu­nity for the gamer.</p>
