    <p>WASHINGTON • When US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump presided over a grandiose White House sign­ing cer­e­mony for new ac­cords be­tween Is­rael and two Arab states last week, his re-elec­tion cam­paign wasted lit­tle time cash­ing in.</p>
    <p>Two days af­ter the event, his cam­paign re­leased a slick, 30-sec­ond ad­ver­tise­ment fea­tur­ing footage from the cer­e­mony and de­pict­ing Mr Trump as a heroic peace­maker for bring­ing Is­rael into nor­malised re­la­tions with the United Arab Emi­rates and Bahrain.</p>
    <p>“They said it couldn’t be done. But Pres­i­dent Trump did it,” a nar­ra­tor de­clares in the dra­matic tones heard in Hol­ly­wood block­buster pre­views. “The first Mid­dle East peace agree­ment in decades.”</p>
    <p>In an elec­tion dom­i­nated by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, ra­cial un­rest and now a Supreme Court va­cancy, the Pres­i­dent’s Mid­dle East deal has al­ready faded into the end­less news cy­cle.</p>
    <p>But the ad is the lat­est sign that how­ever much Mr Trump might value his diplo­macy for its po­ten­tial to re­shape the re­gion, his cam­paign also sees a po­tent mes­sage that may not be top of mind for most vot­ers but could move a hand­ful of the right ones in the right places.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s al­lies say the deal res­onates par­tic­u­larly with Jewish Amer­i­cans, who are a key vot­ing bloc in the crit­i­cal swing state of Florida, and evan­gel­i­cal Chris­tians, who are fer­vent sup­port­ers of Is­rael and its broad­est ter­ri­to­rial claims.</p>
    <p>“This is an im­por­tant event, not just be­cause of the sub­stance but be­cause of the sym­bol­ism as well,” said Mr Matt Brooks, the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Repub­li­can Jewish Coali­tion.</p>
    <p>“I think that shows to peo­ple who may not be nec­es­sar­ily tuned in to foreign pol­icy that he’s got the lead­er­ship and judg­ment to act on a vi­sion and have suc­cess.”</p>
    <p>Democrats call such talk wish­ful think­ing, ar­gu­ing that vot­ers cur­rently care lit­tle about foreign pol­icy. They also note Mr Trump’s un­pop­u­lar­ity among Amer­i­can Jews, cit­ing a poll re­leased last week by the Jewish Elec­torate In­sti­tute, which found that he trails his Demo­cratic op­po­nent, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, 67 per cent to 30 per cent among Jewish vot­ers.</p>
    <p>“What­ever their long-term mean­ing, I’m not sure that these deals, com­ing as late as they are in the mid­dle of a pan­demic and the fi­nal throes of the race, mean that much,” said Mr David Ax­el­rod, a for­mer se­nior strate­gist to pres­i­dent Barack Obama, even be­fore the death of Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s not where peo­ple are fo­cused and vot­ers tend to dis­count late-break­ing an­nounce­ments as part of the cam­paign.”</p>
    <p>More sig­nif­i­cant could be Jewish and evan­gel­i­cal vot­ers. Even if most Amer­i­cans care lit­tle about shift­ing Mid­dle East al­liances, i n swing states that could be de­cided by mere thou­sands of votes, such as Florida, even a slight shift within those groups could swing a close state to­wards Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Mr Karl Rove – a for­mer strate­gist to pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush – who now in­for­mally ad­vises the Trump cam­paign, noted that in his win­ning 2018 cam­paign, Gov­er­nor Ron DeSan­tis of Florida won by fewer than 40,000 votes af­ter car­ry­ing 35 per cent of the Jewish vote.</p>
    <p>“Evan­gel­i­cals do care about char­ac­ter, so there is this ten­sion,” Mr Rove said. “So when he gets con­ser­va­tive judges and stands with Is­rael and forges new friend­ships in the re­gion, that helps.”</p>
