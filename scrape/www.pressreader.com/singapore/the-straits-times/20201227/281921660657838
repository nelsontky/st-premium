    <p>Two Sin­ga­pore­ans sen­tenced to death in China for drug traf­fick­ing have been pro­vided con­sular as­sis­tance by the Sin­ga­pore Con­sulate-Gen­eral in Guangzhou, said the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>MFA said that the con­sulate-gen­eral pro­vided reg­u­lar as­sis­tance to Siti As­lina Ju­naidi and Mohd Yusri Mohd Yus­sof, in­clud­ing vis­it­ing them reg­u­larly un­til the Covid-19 outbreak hit this year.</p>
    <p>The con­sulate-gen­eral also en­sured that the pair had ac­cess to med­i­cal at­ten­tion and le­gal as­sis­tance, and has been in con­tact with their fam­i­lies to pro­vide con­sular sup­port as re­cently as last week.</p>
    <p>As­lina, who is now 35, and Mohd Yusri, 44, were ini­tially ar­rested in Oc­to­ber 2015 in Shen­zhen for al­legedly smug­gling 11kg of metham­phetamine in 28 women’s hand­bags in­side their suit­cases, CNN re­ported on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>They were found guilty of drug traf­fick­ing and sen­tenced to death in July. As Mohd Yusri’s sen­tence has been sus­pended for two years, he may get a lighter sen­tence of life im­pris­on­ment in­stead.</p>
    <p>As­lina is con­sid­ered to have played a more ac­tive role, said CNN, and if her fi­nal ap­peal is un­suc­cess­ful, she faces ex­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean hu­man rights lawyer M. Ravi, who has been giv­ing ad­vice on the case, said on Face­book on Thurs­day that find­ing le­gal rep­re­sen­ta­tion in China has been dif­fi­cult, but a pro bono lawyer has stepped for­ward to help.</p>
    <p>Mr Ravi added that he is look­ing for­ward to work­ing closely with the yet un­named lawyer to have As­lina’s case re­viewed by the Ap­peal Court in China.</p>
    <p>A court had heard that As­lina met a man named Chibu­zor On­wuka while job hunt­ing on­line late in 2014. The man of­fered her $2,000 to $3,000 in com­mis­sions per trip to move goods – of­ten hand­bags, lin­gerie and toner car­tridges – be­tween China and Cam­bo­dia one to two times a month.</p>
    <p>As­lina would pick up prod­ucts in Guangzhou and travel by plane with them to Ph­nom Penh.</p>
    <p>She re­ferred Mohd Yusri to the scheme in July 2015, but the two were later caught af­ter they had gone on two such trips to­gether.</p>
    <p>Both As­lina and Mohd Yusri re­port­edly claimed they did not have any knowl­edge of the drugs in­side the prod­ucts when they were ar­rested by Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>It is not known where Chibu­zor On­wuka is but he is be­ing “han­dled sep­a­rately”, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments.</p>
