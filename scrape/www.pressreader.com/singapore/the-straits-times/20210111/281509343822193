    <p>In­done­sia’s search teams have de­ter­mined the es­ti­mated lo­ca­tion of the black box of a crashed Sri­wi­jaya Air Boe­ing 737 plane after scour­ing the Java sea floor us­ing sonar, and re­trieved body parts and air­craft de­bris.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trans­port Safety Com­mis­sion (KNKT) chief So­er­janto Tjahjono said search teams picked up two emer­gency sig­nals trans­mit­ted by the black box on the sea floor about 23m deep. The black box con­sists of the cock­pit voice recorder and the flight data recorder of the plane, which crashed last Satur­day af­ter­noon shortly after take-off.</p>
    <p>The cause re­mains un­known, but Cap­tain Nurc­ahyo Utomo, head of air safety in­ves­ti­ga­tion at KNKT, told The Straits Times that the plane likely broke apart when</p>
    <p>it crashed into the sea.</p>
    <p>“It is not yet con­clu­sive... The pre­lim­i­nary data in­di­cates that the air­craft broke apart upon im­pact with the wa­ter,” he said, adding that the de­bris would have been scat­tered across a larger area if the plane had bro­ken apart in mid-air.</p>
    <p>Weather was favourable to search op­er­a­tions yes­ter­day be­fore the sea cur­rent turned stronger later in the day, with heavy rain in the evening. Vis­i­bil­ity un­der­wa­ter was about 3m dur­ing the daylight, ac­cord­ing to divers de­ployed there.</p>
    <p>“With night­fall, we re­frain from re­ly­ing on divers… Ves­sels with sonar ca­pac­ity con­tinue op­er­at­ing,” Mr Ras­man M.S., the op­er­a­tions di­rec­tor of In­done­sia’s search and res­cue agency Basar­nas, told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary chief Hadi Tjah­janto said buoys had been placed as mark­ings on the sur­face to as­sist fur­ther searches.</p>
    <p>Capt Nurc­ahyo said his agency re­ceived an of­fer from Sin­ga­pore’s Trans­port Safety In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau to as­sist in the search of the black box, and has also com­mu­ni­cated with the United States Na­tional Trans­porta­tion Safety Board.</p>
    <p>“For the ar­rival of coun­ter­parts from over­seas, KNKT is still work­ing with the rel­e­vant lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to get the nod as cur­rently In­done­sia im­poses a ban on the en­try of all for­eign na­tion­als un­til Jan 14 (due to Covid-19),” Capt Nurc­ahyo said in a video mes­sage sent to re­porters.</p>
    <p>The po­lice dis­as­ter vic­tim iden­ti­fi­ca­tion depart­ment re­ceived seven bags of body parts yes­ter­day and will start the iden­ti­fi­ca­tion process to­day. Twenty-one DNA sam­ples were taken from the fam­i­lies of the vic­tims yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ten bags of smaller air­craft de­bris and 16 larger parts of the wreck­age were hauled from the Java Sea yes­ter­day and would be handed over to KNKT for in­ves­ti­ga­tion, ac­cord­ing to Basar­nas chief Ba­gus Pu­ruhito at last night’s press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Among the de­bris were parts of the plane’s wheels and the en­gine, a torn steel al­loy sheet with blue and red paint that matches Sri­wi­jaya Air’s cor­po­rate colours and pink chil­dren’s trousers.</p>
    <p>The Boe­ing 737-500 plane dis­ap­peared from radar four min­utes after tak­ing off, above the sea roughly be­tween Laki is­land and Lan­cang is­land. Sixty-two peo­ple were aboard – 12 crew and 50 pas­sen­gers, in­clud­ing seven chil­dren and three in­fants.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo yes­ter­day ex­pressed his deep con­do­lences to the fam­i­lies of the vic­tims.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, he said: “I or­dered the Trans­port Min­is­ter and the search and res­cue agency head – as­sisted by the armed forces and po­lice – to im­me­di­ately con­duct search and res­cue op­er­a­tions as swiftly as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>The search fo­cuses on the outer ring of the Laki and Lan­cang is­lands off the Jakarta coast.</p>
    <p>“We will op­er­ate in the same lo­ca­tions – sea sur­face and un­der­wa­ter – ex­pand­ing the search area slightly and reach­ing some coastal ar­eas in the di­rec­tion the sea cur­rents are flow­ing,” Mr Ba­gus told re­porters.</p>
