    <p>Af­ter the an­nus hor­ri­bilis that was 2020, which ush­ered in the worst eco­nomic re­ces­sion in Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory, the econ­omy will re­bound in 2021.</p>
    <p>But we can­not yet be con­fi­dent that this will segue into sus­tained growth, be­cause the shadow of Covid-19 still looms large.</p>
    <p>There are three di­men­sions of this that will weigh on the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The first is global eco­nomic con­di­tions. De­spite Sin­ga­pore’s com­mend­able con­trol of the pan­demic, it has a high de­pen­dence not only on trade, but also on the cross-bor­der flows of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>So while Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess in pan­demic con­trol is a nec­es­sary con­di­tion for the econ­omy to mount a sus­tained recovery, it is not suf­fi­cient. The suc­cess of other coun­tries – es­pe­cially those with which Sin­ga­pore has strong link­ages – is also im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, the re­ces­sion in­duced by the pan­demic was not a nor­mal re­ces­sion. Not all sec­tors of the econ­omy were equally hit.</p>
    <p>Some were (and re­main) dev­as­tated, oth­ers were rel­a­tively less af­fected and a few pros­pered even more than be­fore the pan­demic. The un­bal­anced na­ture of the re­ces­sion will have im­por­tant im­pli­ca­tions for the pace and tra­jec­tory of the recovery.</p>
    <p>Third, the year-long pan­demic will have en­dur­ing af­ter-ef­fects. Some of these will be pos­i­tive, such as the ac­cel­er­a­tion of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion among con­sumers and busi­nesses, which will not be re­versed.</p>
    <p>But oth­ers are neg­a­tive, in­clud­ing the in­val­i­da­tion of long­stand­ing busi­ness models, dis­rupted sup­ply chains and ris­ing cor­po­rate dis­tress, which will come into sharper fo­cus only later this year and could have rip­ple ef­fects.</p>
    <p>GLOBAL UN­CER­TAIN­TIES</p>
    <p>The low base for gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) last year, ris­ing con­sumer con­fi­dence as vac­cines are de­ployed and the release of pentup de­mand will en­sure that all economies re­bound by vary­ing de­grees this year.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore, the of­fi­cial pro­jec­tion is for 4 to 6 per cent growth.</p>
    <p>Al­though this will be the high­est in a decade (helped by a low base fol­low­ing a con­trac­tion of 6.5 to 6 per cent last year), GDP will still re­main be­low pre-pan­demic lev­els till at least the end of this year.</p>
    <p>The economies of Sin­ga­pore’s ma­jor trade part­ners will also re­bound – China by 8.2 per cent, the United States by 3.9 per cent, the euro zone by 5.2 per cent, and the Asean-5 (In­done­sia, Malaysia, Philip­pines, Thai­land and Viet­nam) by 6.2 per cent, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund (IMF) in its lat­est (Oc­to­ber) World Eco­nomic Out­look.</p>
    <p>But a cou­ple of caveats here: First, de­spite re­bound­ing, the GDP of the US and euro zone – two of Sin­ga­pore’s three largest trade part­ners – will still fall short of 2019 lev­els. And se­cond, af­ter Oc­to­ber, large parts of the US and the euro zone (as well as some Asian coun­tries) faced re­newed waves of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and in­ten­si­fied their lock­downs, sti­fling eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity – which could make the IMF’s pro­vi­sional pro­jec­tions look op­ti­mistic.</p>
    <p>Cross-bor­der travel to and from Sin­ga­pore is still sub­dued. From Jan­uary through end-Oc­to­ber, vis­i­tor ar­rivals were down 83 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>While the Govern­ment plans to in­tro­duce “travel bub­bles”, the ef­fec­tive­ness of these will de­pend not only on how well Sin­ga­pore con­trols the pan­demic, but also on how well other coun­tries do so, which is still un­cer­tain; Sin­ga­pore can open its bor­ders, but this will not do much good if other coun­tries can­not open theirs, or im­pose dra­co­nian travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>As long as this un­cer­tainty per­sists, the prospects for tourism-de­pen­dent sec­tors such as avi­a­tion and large parts of hos­pi­tal­ity, food and bev­er­age, of­fline re­tail and en­ter­tain­ment will re­main pre­car­i­ous.</p>
    <p>UN­BAL­ANCED RE­CES­SION, IN­COM­PLETE RECOVERY</p>
    <p>As in many coun­tries, Sin­ga­pore’s re­ces­sion has been highly un­even. A few sec­tors or sub-sec­tors such as e-com­merce, do­mes­tic lo­gis­tics, supermarke­ts and tech­nol­ogy-in­ten­sive and bio­med­i­cal sec­tors have flour­ished, thanks to changes in con­sumer be­hav­iour, ris­ing dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, and strong de­mand for semi­con­duc­tors and med­i­cal sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial ser­vices as well as parts of man­u­fac­tur­ing have held up rea­son­ably well. But high-con­tact sec­tors, such as tourism-re­lated in­dus­tries, have been badly hit.</p>
    <p>The brunt of the Covid-19 re­ces­sion has mainly been borne by the labour-in­ten­sive ser­vice sec­tor, which is true of vir­tu­ally all economies. Thus, in its bian­nual Macroe­co­nomic Re­view in Oc­to­ber, the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore cau­tioned that “some pock­ets of the econ­omy may not re­cover to pre-pan­demic lev­els even by the end of (2021)” and that the eco­nomic re­bound the econ­omy ex­pe­ri­enced in the third quar­ter “is ex­pected to fade to an in­com­plete recovery”.</p>
    <p>It also flagged the like­li­hood of firms and house­holds hold­ing back on in­vest­ment and dis­cre­tionary spend­ing be­cause of in­come losses and in­creased un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>There is another as­pect of un­bal­anced re­ces­sions – where cor­po­rate dis­tress is par­tic­u­larly con­cen­trated in spe­cific sec­tors – which is wor­ri­some, and that re­lates to jobs.</p>
    <p>Re­cent re­search by econ­o­mists from the Bank for In­ter­na­tional Set­tle­ments in­di­cates that such re­ces­sions “tend to be deeper and longer, and leave an es­pe­cially large im­print on the labour mar­ket, likely be­cause of skill mis­matches and sec­tor-spe­cific hu­man cap­i­tal”. In other words, in un­bal­anced re­ces­sions, job losses tend to be con­cen­trated in cer­tain ar­eas of the econ­omy, whereas job va­can­cies tend to arise in to­tally dif­fer­ent ar­eas that need spe­cific skills.</p>
    <p>This has been the case in Sin­ga­pore, where many of the job losses so far have been in avi­a­tion, of­fline re­tail, hos­pi­tal­ity and the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try, and among nonPMETs (pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians), whereas many of the va­can­cies are in tech­nol­ogy sec­tors, health­care, fi­nance and parts of man­u­fac­tur­ing, and PMETs are in high de­mand.</p>
    <p>While re­train­ing, ca­reer-con­ver</p>
    <p>$14.3b</p>
    <p>Estimated value of for­eign in­vest­ment commitment­s in the first half of last year, com­pared with $15.2 bil­lion for the whole of 2019. non-per­form­ing loans – which are typ­i­cally a lag­ging in­di­ca­tor in any eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>NOT ALL DOOM AND GLOOM</p>
    <p>The year 2021 will not be all doom and gloom for the econ­omy. Many busi­nesses have gone dig­i­tal and trans­formed their busi­ness models to be­come more cost-ef­fi­cient and pro­duc­tive – which will be a per­ma­nent change that will au­gur well for their fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has strengths in many of the core in­dus­tries that may ben­e­fit from tail­winds in the post-pan­demic era, such as semi­con­duc­tors, bio­med­i­cal and dig­i­tally pow­ered busi­ness and fi­nan­cial ser­vices. It has been able to at­tract sig­nif­i­cant for­eign in­vest­ment commitment­s, even dur­ing the pan­demic – about $14.3 bil­lion in the first half of last year, com­pared with $15.2 bil­lion for the whole of 2019.</p>
    <p>And as vac­cines pro­lif­er­ate glob­ally, con­sumer con­fi­dence around the world will surge and even travel-re­lated sec­tors will open up. But Covid-19 will still con­tinue to cast a shadow on the econ­omy – even as it re­cov­ers – well into 2021.</p>
