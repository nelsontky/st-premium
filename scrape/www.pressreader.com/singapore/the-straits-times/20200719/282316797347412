    <p>When Cindy Craw­ford an­nounced she was in­tend­ing to move on from mod­el­ling ahead of her 50th birth­day four years ago, it made head­lines. Such is the power of this beauty with the trade­mark mole. The ru­mours turned out to be some­what ex­ag­ger­ated.</p>
    <p>She is back, ap­pear­ing on the cover of Harper’s Bazaar, look­ing as fit and fab­u­lous as she ever was.</p>
    <p>She is pos­si­bly the first of her su­per­model co­terie – the oth­ers be­ing Naomi Camp­bell, 50, Christy Turling­ton, 51, Claudia Schif­fer, 49, and Linda Evan­ge­lista, 55 – to have suc­cess­fully par­layed her mod­el­ling fame into Cindy Inc, build­ing an em­pire rang­ing from sk­in­care to home de­sign.</p>
    <p>The ma­tri­arch of her own mod­el­ling clan – her two chil­dren, son Pres­ley, 21, and daugh­ter Kaia, 18, are fash­ion su­per­stars them­selves — now has the free­dom to pick and choose her projects.</p>
    <p>Craw­ford takes a few min­utes out of her busy sched­ule to an­swer our ques­tions.</p>
    <p>This ar­ti­cle first ap­peared in Harper’s Bazaar Sin­ga­pore, the lead­ing fash­ion glossy on the best of style, beauty, de­sign, travel and the arts.</p>
    <p>Go to www.harpers bazaar.com.sg and fol­low @harpers­bazaarsg on In­sta­gram and harpers bazaarsin­ga­pore on Face­book. The July is­sue is out on news­stands.</p>
    <p>Tell us about your first cover shoot for Harper’s Bazaar Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It was in De­cem­ber 2005. I was in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in my role as an Omega am­bas­sador.</p>
    <p>The watch brand asked me to do a shoot as part of my sched­ule there.</p>
    <p>I re­mem­ber ar­riv­ing at Car­cosa Seri Ne­gara and I in­stantly con­nected with Ken­neth Goh, the editor-in-chief, as well as Si­mon Upton, the pho­tog­ra­pher. It was such an el­e­gant story and we loved shoot­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>How do you keep look­ing and feel­ing fab­u­lous af­ter more than 30 years in the busi­ness?</p>
    <p>Thanks, I do try. I ex­er­cise, try to eat right and take care of my skin, but the most im­por­tant thing is hav­ing grat­i­tude and do­ing things that make you feel good: like liv­ing your work, con­nect­ing with friends and fam­ily, and giv­ing back.</p>
    <p>What is your ad­vice to new mod­els?</p>
    <p>This is such an ex­cit­ing time in the mod­el­ling in­dus­try and I have a front-row seat watch­ing my daugh­ter Kaia’s ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Some of my ad­vice is the same as it would be for any job – be on time, be pre­pared and stay off your phone.</p>
    <p>But specif­i­cally for mod­el­ling, au­then­tic­ity is even more im­por­tant now than ever.</p>
    <p>As the fash­ion in­dus­try em­braces diver­sity, so­cial me­dia gives ev­ery­one a plat­form to speak his truth and share what is im­por­tant to him.</p>
    <p>Is there one thing that you want to forge in this new decade?</p>
    <p>My fo­cus will be more and more on bal­ance and be­ing of ser­vice.</p>
    <p>My chil­dren are nearly grown, but I know I still have a lot to give. Find­ing new ways to share my gifts is what ex­cites me.</p>
    <p>Who are the fab­u­lous women who in­spire you? Who is your real-life hero?</p>
    <p>More than any­one else, my mother in­spires me and is my hero.</p>
    <p>She lost a child, my lit­tle brother Jeff, to leukaemia and also went through a bad divorce from my fa­ther.</p>
    <p>But she re­mains the type of woman who chooses to see the best in ev­ery­thing and ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>For mod­el­ling, au­then­tic­ity is even more im­por­tant now than ever. As the fash­ion in­dus­try em­braces diver­sity, so­cial me­dia gives ev­ery­one a plat­form to speak his truth and share what is im­por­tant to him.</p>
