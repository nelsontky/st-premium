    <p>WARSAW • Poland is open­ing a field hospi­tal at Warsaw’s land­mark na­tional sta­dium and will bring i n the army to han­dle drive-through Covid-19 test­ing fa­cil­i­ties amid a surge in new in­fec­tions that threat­ens to over­whelm the health­care sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said the gov­ern­ment was in talks with pri­vate med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties to pro­vide beds and wards for coro­n­avirus pa­tients, and planned to dou­ble the base salaries of state health work­ers.</p>
    <p>Other ma­jor cities are also rush­ing to set up new tem­po­rary hos­pi­tals, the Health Min­istry said, af­ter new daily cases nearly hit 10,000 last week. Yes­ter­day, 7,482 cases were re­ported, af­ter a week­end downtick in test­ing.</p>
    <p>“I fear that look­ing at the de­vel­op­ment of the sit­u­a­tion, we will have this in­fra­struc­ture (of new tem­po­rary hos­pi­tals) set up for weeks, if not months, in sev­eral places in Poland,” gov­ern­ment spokesman Piotr Muller said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Adam Niedziel­ski said new daily in­fec­tions could soon surge to 20,000 if so­cial dis­tanc­ing and other rules were not widely com­plied with.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has al­ready urged cit­i­zens to stay home, and or­dered gyms and pools to close, restau­rants to cut hours, and schools to shift to re­mote classes.</p>
    <p>But Mr Niedziel­ski said the gov­ern­ment had not de­cided to in­tro­duce any ad­di­tional re­stric­tions on people vis­it­ing fam­ily and friends’ graves on Nov 1, when mil­lions of Poles re­mem­ber their loved ones on All Saints’ Day.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment was ini­tially suc­cess­ful in con­tain­ing the first wave of the pan­demic in the spring, but has faced crit­i­cism for fail­ing to pre­pare the coun­try for the se­cond wave.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has al­ready... or­dered gyms and pools to close, restau­rants to cut hours, and schools to shift to re­mote classes.</p>
