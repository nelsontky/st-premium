    <p>For­mer sales en­gi­neer Sher­min Ho re­ceived word about be­ing laid off not once, but twice over the course of about a month.</p>
    <p>The first time she was told about her re­trench­ment was in early May, about a week after she dis­cov­ered that she was al­most two months preg­nant with her first child.</p>
    <p>“It was a tough pe­riod be­cause the preg­nancy was un­planned. So when the re­trench­ment no­tice came around, it felt like a dou­ble whammy,” said Ms Ho, 29, whose hus­band is a full-time tu­tor.</p>
    <p>But after telling the soft­ware com­pany’s hu­man re­source de­part­ment about her preg­nancy, the re­trench­ment let­ter, which did not in­clude ma­ter­nity ben­e­fits, was with­drawn.</p>
    <p>She heaved a sigh of re­lief and thought her job, which she started in De­cem­ber last year, would be safe for at least the next year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the sec­ond wave of re­trench­ments came in June, and she was once again told that she would be laid off. This time, the re­trench­ment pack­age in­cluded ma­ter­nity ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>The re­trench­ments re­sulted in the com­pany, which is head­quar­tered in the United States, lay­ing off 15 per cent of its work­force across its 40 of­fices.</p>
    <p>About 15 peo­ple from the Sin­ga­pore of­fice lost their jobs.</p>
    <p>“The sec­ond time around, I was a lot more calm be­cause it was the same process. And I al­ready knew the com­pany was not do­ing as well,” said Ms Ho. “But, of course, it was still a sur­prise as I never thought I would be re­trenched at my age.”</p>
    <p>After fran­ti­cally send­ing out ap­pli­ca­tions, at­tend­ing vir­tual in­ter­views, and com­plet­ing writ­ing tests and pre­sen­ta­tions all in a bid to se­cure a new job, she found work late last month as a busi­ness an­a­lyst at a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany.</p>
    <p>“I knew that as a preg­nant woman com­pet­ing against other can­di­dates, it would be chal­leng­ing es­pe­cially in this cli­mate,” said Ms Ho.</p>
    <p>But the “roller coaster ride” ex­pe­ri­ence has taught her to em­brace the tough times.</p>
    <p>“While there was un­cer­tainty and self-doubt in the be­gin­ning, I do find sup­port from the other col­leagues who were also laid off. We have each other for sup­port.”</p>
