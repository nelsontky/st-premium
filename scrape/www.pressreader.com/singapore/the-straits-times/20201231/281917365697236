    <p>ADEN (Ye­men) • At least 20 peo­ple were killed and dozens more wounded in an at­tack on Aden air­port yes­ter­day, a se­cu­rity source said, shortly after a plane car­ry­ing a newly formed Cabi­net for govern­ment-held parts of Ye­men ar­rived from Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>Loud blasts and gun­fire were heard at the air­port shortly after the plane ar­rived, wit­nesses said.</p>
    <p>The Cabi­net mem­bers, in­clud­ing Prime Min­is­ter Maeen Ab­dul­ma­lik Saeed, as well as Saudi Am­bas­sador to Ye­men Mo­hammed Said Al-Jaber, were trans­ferred safely to the city’s pres­i­den­tial palace, the wit­nesses and Saudi me­dia said.</p>
    <p>“We and the mem­bers of the govern­ment are in the tem­po­rary cap­i­tal of Aden and ev­ery­one is fine,” Mr Maeen tweeted from Maasheq palace.</p>
    <p>“The cow­ardly ter­ror­ist act that tar­geted Aden air­port is part of the war that is be­ing waged against the Ye­meni state and its great peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Mr Al-Jaber tweeted: “Peace, se­cu­rity and sta­bil­ity will pre­vail thanks to Ye­me­nis’ strong will and their brave govern­ment.”</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of In­for­ma­tion Moam­mar Al-Eryani, also on Twit­ter, blamed Iran-backed Houthi rebels who have been fight­ing the govern­ment since 2014.</p>
    <p>No one claimed re­spon­si­bil­ity. A lo­cal se­cu­rity source said three mor­tar shells had landed on the air­port’s hall.</p>
    <p>The newly formed Cabi­net unites the govern­ment of Pres­i­dent Abd-Rabbu Man­sour Hadi with south­ern sep­a­ratists.</p>
    <p>The two groups are the main Ye­meni fac­tions in a south­ern­based, Saudi-backed al­liance, fight­ing against the Houthi move­ment that con­trols the north, in­clud­ing the cap­i­tal, Sanaa.</p>
    <p>Live tele­vi­sion footage f rom Saudi-owned Al Ara­biya chan­nel showed dozens of peo­ple leav­ing the air­plane when a first blast hit the air­port’s hall. Heavy gun­fire from ar­moured ve­hi­cles fol­lowed, with plumes of white and black smoke ris­ing from the scene.</p>
    <p>Other video footage showed smashed glass and dam­age to the ter­mi­nal’s con­crete walls.</p>
    <p>The south­ern port city of Aden has been mired in vi­o­lence be­cause of a rift be­tween the sep­a­ratists and Mr Hadi’s govern­ment, based there after be­ing driven from the cap­i­tal by the Houthis in 2014.</p>
    <p>The sep­a­ratist South­ern Tran­si­tional Coun­cil, which seeks in­de­pen­dence for south Ye­men, de­clared self-rule in Aden ear­lier this year, trig­ger­ing clashes and com­pli­cat­ing United Na­tions ef­forts to forge a per­ma­nent cease­fire in the over­all con­flict.</p>
    <p>The Saudi-led coali­tion announced ear­lier this month the new power-shar­ing Cabi­net that would in­clude the sep­a­ratists.</p>
    <p>The new govern­ment will have to ad­dress ur­gent is­sues like the de­val­u­a­tion of the riyal, pro­vid­ing ba­sic ser­vices and im­ple­ment­ing the se­cu­rity and mil­i­tary parts of the Novem­ber 2019 power-shar­ing agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The Cabi­net trav­elled from Riyadh, where both par­ties ne­go­ti­ated for more than a year with Saudi me­di­a­tion.</p>
    <p>UN Ye­men en­voy Martin Grif­fiths con­demned the at­tack in a state­ment: “I wish the Cabi­net strength i n fac­ing the dif­fi­cult tasks ahead. This un­ac­cept­able act of vi­o­lence is a tragic re­minder of the im­por­tance of bring­ing Ye­men ur­gently back on the path to­wards peace.”</p>
    <p>The cow­ardly ter­ror­ist act that tar­geted Aden air­port is part of the war that is be­ing waged against the Ye­meni state and its great peo­ple.</p>
