    <p>Most week­ends, Sin­ga­pore-based Malaysian dancer Eva Tey crosses the Cause­way to visit her re­tired par­ents in Jo­hor Baru.</p>
    <p>But since the bor­der be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia closed in March due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, she has not been able to go see them.</p>
    <p>In this time, the 28-year-old has felt acute lone­li­ness. “I am also wor­ried about the wel­fare of my par­ents as the sit­u­a­tion is not get­ting any bet­ter in Malaysia,” she says.</p>
    <p>She poured these feel­ings into chore­ograph­ing Be­hind Closed Doors, a project by Maya Dance The­atre about the so­cial iso­la­tion ex­pe­ri­enced by se­niors. It takes the form of an interactiv­e web­site that in­cludes a dance film, a photo ex­hi­bi­tion, po­ems by lo­cal writer Cyril Wong and in­ter­views and re­sources about el­derly lone­li­ness.</p>
    <p>Maya Dance The­atre, founded in 2007 by Kavitha Kr­ish­nan and Im­ran Manaff, com­bines clas­si­cal bharatanat­yam and con­tem­po­rary dance.</p>
    <p>Its so­cially grounded works have ex­am­ined sober­ing is­sues, from men­tal health to sex­ual vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Be­hind Closed Doors is based on five months of re­search, in­clud­ing speak­ing with 12 se­niors. The dance film cen­tres on an empty chair (above) shot in five homes and ex­plores the lack of con­nec­tion be­tween se­niors and their grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“It is not as sim­ple as the el­derly be­ing ne­glected by the younger gen­er­a­tion,” says Tey, who has been a prin­ci­pal dancer with Maya Dance The­atre since 2015.</p>
    <p>“This dance film in­tends to bring out the two sides of the coin, the per­spec­tives of the el­derly and the young adults.”</p>
