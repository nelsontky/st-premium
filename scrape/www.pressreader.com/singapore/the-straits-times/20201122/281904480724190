    <p>He scored the big­gest elec­toral vic­tory in a gen­er­a­tion but as the first an­niver­sary of that sem­i­nal achieve­ment is ap­proach­ing, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s govern­ment re­sem­bles a zom­bie, stum­bling aim­lessly from one cri­sis to an­other.</p>
    <p>Only a month re­mains be­fore Bri­tain’s cur­rent free trade sta­tus with the Euro­pean Union ex­pires. Yet no deal to reg­u­late fu­ture trade with Europe has been con­cluded, and Mr John­son largely ig­nores the sub­ject, obliv­i­ous to the fact that if no ar­range­ments are in place, the im­pact on Bri­tain’s econ­omy will be cat­a­strophic.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter also ap­pears to have no clear strat­egy on how to deal with the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on whom he is ad­dress­ing, he is ei­ther ad­vo­cat­ing lock­ing down all ac­tiv­i­ties in or­der to re­duce in­fec­tion rates, or urg­ing Bri­tons to re­turn to nor­mal­ity, and he ap­pears to be mak­ing both cases with equal con­vic­tion.</p>
    <p>And if this is not enough, over the past week alone, Mr John­son clashed with some of his top pol­icy ad­vis­ers be­cause they had quar­relled with the Prime Min­is­ter’s girl­friend, a story which reads like a badly scripted TV soap opera.</p>
    <p>For good mea­sure, Mr John­son also lost a se­nior civil ser­vant who walked out in dis­gust be­cause the Prime Min­is­ter re­fused to discipline a Cab­i­net min­is­ter who</p>
    <p>vi­o­lated the of­fi­cial stan­dards of good gover­nance.</p>
    <p>Sel­dom be­fore has a Bri­tish leader fallen from grace so quickly, and so com­pre­hen­sively. But the roller-coaster ex­is­tence of peaks of fame fol­lowed by po­lit­i­cal disas­ter and then a sud­den re­vival is what the “Boris John­son Ex­pe­ri­ence” is all about.</p>
    <p>The 56-year-old has spent a life­time keep­ing ev­ery­one guess­ing about his abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Although highly in­tel­li­gent, well read and ed­u­cated at Bri­tain’s top pri­vate school and one of the top Ox­ford col­leges, Mr John­son rather en­joys cul­ti­vat­ing the im­age of a bum­bling in­di­vid­ual.</p>
    <p>He started his ca­reer as a jour­nal­ist, where he earned a rep­u­ta­tion for – to put it po­litely – in­vent­ing “al­ter­na­tive facts” by some­times re­port­ing sto­ries which never ex­isted.</p>
    <p>His pri­vate life has al­ways been a mess: Two for­mer mar­riages plus an­other on the way, plenty of girl­friends in be­tween and at least six chil­dren from var­i­ous li­aisons, with the ru­mour that even Mr John­son is strug­gling to keep track of his to­tal score.</p>
    <p>He comes across as the clas­sic up­per-class English­man, com­plete with his use of slang words typ­i­cal of Bri­tain’s elite board­ing school. But this sup­posed epit­ome of aris­to­cratic Bri­tain is a quar­ter Turk­ish and a quar­ter Jewish, and held United States cit­i­zen­ship for a large part of his life. In short, what you see with Mr John­son is sel­dom what you get.</p>
    <p>He rose to the top be­cause he had a per­fect sense of po­lit­i­cal tim­ing and con­sid­er­able amount of per­sonal charm. But now that he has achieved his dream of be­ing prime min­is­ter, he seems ut­terly bored with dis­charg­ing the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of high of­fice.</p>
    <p>He sel­dom reads the briefs civil ser­vants pre­pare for him, so is of­ten caught off-guard in an­swer­ing ques­tions in Par­lia­ment; his stan­dard tech­nique when he is lost for words is ei­ther to change the topic or, if this is im­pos­si­ble, sim­ply in­vent an an­swer.</p>
    <p>The strat­egy is based on the as­sump­tion that few peo­ple bother to check the facts he rat­tles off and, even if they do dis­cover that the Prime Min­is­ter’s an­swer was in­cor­rect, by then at­ten­tion would have shifted to other mat­ters.</p>
    <p>And when con­fronted with dif­fi­cult pol­icy op­tions, Mr John­son’s in­stinct is sim­ply to pre­var­i­cate and avoid mak­ing any de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Left to his own de­vices, the Prime Min­is­ter’s pref­er­ences are to spend most of his time in the com­pany of women, good books and good food, ap­par­ently in that or­der of pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is that Mr John­son’s ob­vi­ous dis­in­ter­est in op­er­at­ing the ma­chin­ery of govern­ment is now hav­ing an im­pact on the coun­try’s per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Mr Charles Moore, the of­fi­cial bi­og­ra­pher of Lady Mar­garet Thatcher, Bri­tain’s leg­endary prime min­is­ter dur­ing the 1980s, bril­liantly summed up Bri­tain’s cur­rent predica­ment in the fol­low­ing terms: “With Boris, the na­tion must con­stantly con­front the prob­lem that a) he is alarm­ingly un­suited for high com­mand but b) he has unique lead­er­ship qual­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>And the dilemma fac­ing the coun­try looks likely to only get worse.</p>
    <p>Last week’s loss of the 48-year-old Mr Do­minic Cum­mings, the Prime Min­is­ter’s chief po­lit­i­cal ad­viser who at­tained celebrity sta­tus for his di­shev­elled ap­pear­ance but was the real brain be­hind the John­son en­ter­prise, means that the in­ter­nal power strug­gle over who should be the Prime Min­is­ter’s chief of staff will in­ten­sify.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son him­self is self-iso­lat­ing for an­other week for fear that he may have con­tracted the coron­avirus for a se­cond time this year.</p>
    <p>And that makes Ms Car­rie Sy­monds, his fi­ancee and mother of his lat­est child, the only ad­viser with ac­cess to the Prime Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Ap­par­ently, Ms Sy­monds has strong views on ev­ery­thing from a Cab­i­net reshuf­fle to what in­di­vid­ual govern­ment depart­ments should be do­ing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, and as has been the case for the past year, no­body quite knows what the Prime Min­is­ter is think­ing.</p>
    <p>The 56-year-old has spent a life­time keep­ing ev­ery­one guess­ing about his abil­i­ties. Although highly in­tel­li­gent, well read and ed­u­cated at Bri­tain’s top pri­vate school and one of the top Ox­ford col­leges, Mr John­son rather en­joys cul­ti­vat­ing the im­age of a bum­bling in­di­vid­ual.</p>
