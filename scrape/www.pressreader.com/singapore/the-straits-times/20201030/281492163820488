    <p>PARIS • France raised the se­cu­rity alert for French ter­ri­tory to the high­est level yes­ter­day after a knife­man mur­dered three peo­ple at a church, be­head­ing at least one of them in what was de­scribed as a ter­ror at­tack in the city of Nice.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex, who made the an­nounce­ment in Par­lia­ment, called the at­tack “as cow­ardly as it is bar­baric”.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, who vis­ited the site of the at­tack, vowed that “France will not give up on our val­ues” as he urged peo­ple of all re­li­gions to unite and not “give in to the spirit of divi­sion”.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, French po­lice ar­rested a man armed with a long knife in the south-east­ern city of Lyon yes­ter­day as he was about to board a tram.</p>
    <p>The sus­pect, an Afghan na­tional in his 20s who was dressed in tra­di­tional Afghan clothes, “seemed ready to take ac­tion”, said Mr Pierre Oliver, the mayor of Lyon’s Sec­ond Ar­rondisse­ment.</p>
    <p>In Mont­favet, near the city of Avi­gnon, po­lice said they shot dead a man who had ear­lier threat­ened passers-by with a hand­gun.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to French ra­dio sta­tion Europe 1, the man had shouted “Al­lahu Ak­bar” (God is great­est).</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the Nice as­sailant had re­peat­edly shouted “Al­lahu Ak­bar</p>
    <p>even while un­der med­i­ca­tion” after he was in­jured dur­ing his ar­rest, the city’s mayor Chris­tian Estrosi said.</p>
    <p>The Nice at­tacker has been iden­ti­fied as Brahim Aous­saoui, a 21-yearold Tu­nisian who ar­rived in Europe late last month.</p>
    <p>A man and a woman died at the Basil­ica of Notre-Dame, in the heart of the Mediter­ranean re­sort city, while a third per­son died from in­juries after seek­ing refuge in a nearby bar, a po­lice source told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>The dead man was the church’s sac­ristan, who had opened the doors at about 8.30am. The first mass of the day was not due to start for an­other two hours.</p>
    <p>But soon after the 45-year-old started work, a man armed with a knife en­tered the church and slit his throat, be­headed an el­derly woman and badly wounded an­other woman, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>French anti-ter­ror pros­e­cu­tors have opened an in­quiry into what Mr Estrosi called an “Is­lamo-fas­cist at­tack”.</p>
    <p>The at­tack comes while France is still reel­ing from the be­head­ing ear­lier this month of French mid­dle school teacher Sa­muel Paty in Paris by a man of Chechen ori­gin.</p>
    <p>Mr Paty’s at­tacker had said he wanted to pun­ish him for show­ing pupils car­toons of Prophet Muham­mad in a civics les­son.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Macron and his col­leagues – backed by many or­di­nary cit­i­zens – have de­fended the right to dis­play the car­toons, which Mus­lims view as blas­phe­mous.</p>
    <p>At a memo­rial ser­vice for Mr Paty on Oct 21, Mr Macron said that France would not give up the car­i­ca­tures, and pledged to tackle ex­treme Is­lamism in the coun­try, which out­raged many Mus­lim­ma­jor­ity coun­tries, with some gov­ern­ments ac­cus­ing Mr Macron of pur­su­ing an anti-Is­lam agenda.</p>
    <p>Protests have erupted in Bangladesh, Pak­istan, Iraq, Gaza and Turkey.</p>
    <p>In Saudi Ara­bia, a Saudi cit­i­zen wounded a guard in a knife at­tack at the French con­sulate in Jed­dah yes­ter­day. “The as­sailant was ap­pre­hended by Saudi se­cu­rity forces im­me­di­ately after the at­tack. The guard was taken to hos­pi­tal, and his life is not in dan­ger,” the French Em­bassy in Riyadh said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has said it strongly con­demned “provoca­tive acts” that would de­fame Is­lam, while In­done­sia’s Vice-Pres­i­dent Ma’ruf Amin has de­cried Mr Macron’s com­ments that “gen­er­alise Mus­lims”.</p>
    <p>But Euro­pean gov­ern­ments have come out in sup­port of France, with lead­ers from Ger­many, Italy and the Nether­lands pub­licly ex­press­ing their sol­i­dar­ity with Mr Macron.</p>
