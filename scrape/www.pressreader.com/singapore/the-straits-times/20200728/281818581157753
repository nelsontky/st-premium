    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s econ­omy min­is­ter says that the govern­ment will urge busi­nesses to aim for 70 per cent telecom­mut­ing and en­hance other so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures amid a rise in coro­n­avirus cases among work­ers, some in­fected dur­ing af­ter-work so­cial­is­ing.</p>
    <p>Though Ja­pan has largely avoided the mass in­fec­tions that have killed tens of thou­sands else­where, a record surge in cases in the past week in Tokyo and other ma­jor ur­ban ar­eas has ex­perts wor­ried that the coun­try faces a sec­ond wave.</p>
    <p>Econ­omy Min­is­ter Ya­su­toshi Nishimura yes­ter­day said i n a video meet­ing with Ja­panese gov­er­nors that busi­ness lead­ers will be asked to ramp up anti-virus mea­sures such as en­cour­ag­ing the level of telecom­mut­ing achieved dur­ing the coun­try’s state of emer­gency ear­lier this year, when telecom­mut­ing hit 70 per cent to 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>It has since fallen to about 30 per cent, he added.</p>
    <p>He also called on com­pa­nies to en­cour­age stag­gered shifts and avoid large af­ter-work gath­er­ings for drinks or meals.</p>
    <p>Tokyo last week re­ported a daily record of 366 cases, with num­bers also ris­ing in Osaka.</p>
    <p>The south­ern city of Fukuoka re­ported a record 90 cases on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>De­spite the rise in cases, the govern­ment does not plan to call an­other state of emer­gency, Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion com­pared with April is very dif­fer­ent,” he said, cit­ing the small num­ber of se­ri­ous cases as well as fewer in­fec­tions among the elderly.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, 131 new cases were con­firmed in the cap­i­tal, Gover­nor Yuriko Koike said, but noted that test­ing had fallen to about 20 per cent of usual num­bers over the ex­tended hol­i­day week­end.</p>
    <p>She added that se­ri­ous cases rose by one, to 19.</p>
    <p>Con­cern has grown about clus­ters, specif­i­cally those in­volv­ing host and host­ess bars or connected to af­ter-work so­cial­is­ing, along with a rise in cases among those in their 40s and 50s.</p>
    <p>The rate of telecom­mut­ing has lagged in Ja­pan be­cause of a pa­per­driven cul­ture and tech­no­log­i­cal short­com­ings, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral govern­ment re­mains de­ter­mined to restart eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and last week launched a do­mes­tic travel cam­paign in the face of wide­spread crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>Around 30,000 peo­ple in Ja­pan have been in­fected and nearly 1,000 have died.</p>
