    <p>De­sign</p>
    <p>With a hole-punch selfie cam­era and thin bezels around its dis­play, the Pixel 4a looks like most An­droid phones from the past year or two. In com­par­i­son, the iPhone SE re­sem­bles the iPhone 8 (2017) with its chunky screen bezels and rel­a­tively small screen. It looks like some­thing you will find in a vin­tage shop.</p>
    <p>Both phones are handy by to­day’s stan­dards and ideal for those who pre­fer smaller phones. The Pixel 4a (144 x 69.4 x 8.2mm) is slightly larger than the iPhone SE (138.4 x 67.3 x 7.3mm), though they weigh the same (around 140g).</p>
    <p>Win­ner: The Pixel 4a not only looks more mod­ern, but also of­fers a higher screen-to-body ra­tio than the iPhone SE.</p>
    <p>Screen</p>
    <p>See­ing as the Pixel 4a has a 5.8-inch Oled screen com­pared with the iPhone SE’s 4.7-inch LCD, this should be a slam dunk for the Pixel 4a.</p>
    <p>The truth is, the dif­fer­ences are less sig­nif­i­cant than you would think. Yes, the iPhone’s LCD screen can­not pro­duce per­fect blacks like how the Pixel’s Oled screen can, but this LCD screen is of the high­est qual­ity. It is well cal­i­brated and can get very bright (up to 625 nits).</p>
    <p>It also sup­ports Ap­ple’s TrueTone fea­ture that changes the colour tem­per­a­ture ac­cord­ing to am­bi­ent light­ing. While there is a sim­i­lar fea­ture in the flag­ship Pixel 4, it ap­par­ently did not make the cut in the cheaper Pixel 4a.</p>
    <p>How­ever, t he big­gest dis­crep­ancy is in the screen res­o­lu­tion. The 1,334 x 750-pixel res­o­lu­tion of­fered by the iPhone SE is sim­ply inferior to the Pixel 4a’s 2,340 x 1,080-pixel res­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Win­ner: The Pixel 4a of­fers more screen and pix­els than the iPhone SE, de­spite be­ing al­most the same size.</p>
    <p>Cam­eras</p>
    <p>While the higher-end Pix­els and iPhones sport mul­ti­ple rear cam­eras, the wa­tered-down Pixel 4a and iPhone SE come with only one 12-megapixel rear cam­era.</p>
    <p>How­ever, cam­era hard­ware is less crit­i­cal for the Pixel 4a, as Google re­lies heav­ily on soft­ware al­go­rithms (com­pu­ta­tional pho­tog­ra­phy) for its cam­era. Plus, the Pixel 4a has the same cam­era sen­sor as the one on the flag­ship Pixel 4.</p>
    <p>In my test, the pho­tos taken by the Pixel 4a and the Pixel 4 are prac­ti­cally in­dis­tin­guish­able. The Pixel 4a takes slightly longer to process pho­tos be­cause it lacks the Pixel 4’s ded­i­cated im­age pro­ces­sor. It also lacks the Pixel 4’s tele­photo cam­era, which is a mi­nor loss. But you still get Google’s much vaunted Night Sight and as­tropho­tog­ra­phy fea­tures on the Pixel 4a.</p>
    <p>This is not the case for the iPhone SE’s cam­era, which lacks the Night mode and Deep Fu­sion fea­tures found in more ex­pen­sive iPhones. While its cam­era is still de­cent, it is not as ca­pa­ble as the Pixel 4a’s, es­pe­cially if you of­ten take pho­tos in low light.</p>
    <p>Win­ner: The Pixel 4a has the same cam­era hard­ware and soft­ware as the flag­ship Pixel 4, un­like the iPhone SE.</p>
    <p>Fea­tures</p>
    <p>Face recog­ni­tion is un­avail­able on these two mid-range mod­els – re­placed by fin­ger­print sen­sors – though given the cur­rent face mask-wear­ing sit­u­a­tion, it is not a down­side.</p>
    <p>The iPhone’s thick bot­tom bezel houses its Touch ID fin­ger­print sen­sor while the Pixel 4a puts its fin­ger­print reader at the back of its matt plas­tic body.</p>
    <p>The iPhone SE, though, has flag­ship fea­tures in the form of wire­less charg­ing and wa­ter re­sis­tance. It also sup­ports the lat­est Wi-Fi 6 stan­dard.</p>
    <p>All these fea­tures are miss­ing in the Pixel 4a.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the Pixel 4a still has a 3.5mm head­phone jack, which has been miss­ing on iPhones since 2016.</p>
    <p>Win­ner: The iPhone SE for hav­ing fea­tures typ­i­cally found in high­erend mod­els.</p>
    <p>Performanc­e</p>
    <p>The iPhone SE uses the same A13 Bionic chip that is found in Ap­ple’s flag­ship model. It is, with­out a doubt, the fastest mo­bile pro­ces­sor now. Not only would it eas­ily beat the Pixel 4a’s mid-range Qual­comm Snap­dragon 730G in bench­mark tests, but the A13 will also run cir­cles around flag­ship An­droid phones like the Sam­sung Galaxy S20 Ul­tra.</p>
    <p>But in real-world us­age, the performanc­e dif­fer­ence is less pro­nounced. The Pixel 4a is no slouch and does not feel slug­gish at all.</p>
    <p>Users who re­quire more in­ter­nal stor­age can up­grade to a 256GB ver­sion of the iPhone SE, while the Pixel 4a is avail­able only with 128GB non-ex­pand­able stor­age.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Google Pho­tos of­fers free un­lim­ited photo and video up­loads to the cloud at high qual­ity, while Pixel 4a own­ers can get a three-month free trial for the Google One cloud stor­age ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Win­ner: The iPhone SE has the more ca­pa­ble pro­ces­sor, mak­ing it more fu­ture-proof.</p>
    <p>Soft­ware</p>
    <p>Both Ap­ple’s i OS and Google’s An­droid mo­bile op­er­at­ing sys­tems (OS) have been slowly con­verg­ing over the years with each plat­form “bor­row­ing” fea­tures f rom the other.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Google has added more pri­vacy con­trols in An­droid to match the ones i ntro­duced by Ap­ple in iOS. Mean­while, Ap­ple has taken baby steps to­wards re­lax­ing its tight grip over iOS by al­low­ing users to set their own de­fault e-mail and browser apps in­stead of be­ing forced to use Ap­ple’s ver­sions.</p>
    <p>One thing that may tip users to­wards the iPhone SE could be Ap­ple’s im­pres­sively long sup­port for its de­vices (for five to six years).</p>
    <p>Google prom­ises three years of OS up­dates for its Pixel phones, which is a year longer than most An­droid smart­phone mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Win­ner: It is a tie as this boils down to per­sonal pref­er­ence. Be­cause both iOS and An­droid plat­forms try their best to lock users to their ecosys­tems, it is un­com­mon for users to switch be­tween them.</p>
    <p>Bat­tery life</p>
    <p>Re­view­ers crit­i­cised last year’s 5.7-inch Pixel 4 for its poor bat­tery life, but they should have no com­plaints about the Pixel 4a.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter has a larger 3,140mAh bat­tery, up from 2,800mAh in the Pixel 4. And un­like the Pixel 4, which has a faster but pow­er­hun­gry 90Hz re­fresh rate dis­play, the 4a has a stan­dard 60Hz screen.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the Pixel 4a com­fort­ably lasted an en­tire day of us­age with­out re­quir­ing a top-up mid­way.</p>
    <p>In the Straits Times’ video-loop test, the Pixel 4a lasted 111/ hours 2 with the screen bright­ness and vol­ume set to max­i­mum. In com­par­i­son, the Pixel 4 man­aged nine hours while the iPhone SE, which has a puny 1,821mAh bat­tery, lasted 61/ hours. 2</p>
    <p>Win­ner: While the Pixel 4a will not win any ac­co­lades for its bat­tery stamina, it is clearly bet­ter than the iPhone SE.</p>
