    <p>The navy’s Ac­com­pa­ny­ing Sea Se­cu­rity Team (AS­SeT) can usu­ally see the threats it faces when board­ing ships, but Covid-19 has proven to be an in­vis­i­ble and elu­sive en­emy.</p>
    <p>The con­cern is not un­founded: the virus has al­ready struck close to home, with at least five work­ers in marine and re­lated in­dus­tries believed to have been in­fected in their work­place.</p>
    <p>Mas­ter Sergeant Kevin Ni­cholas Si­mon, an AS­SeT of­fi­cer, was on guard when­ever he in­spected a ship. “I was quite afraid be­cause ev­ery time we board ves­sels, the na­tion­al­i­ties are multi-na­tion­al­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>He added: “At first, we were just wor­ried about per­son­nel from China, but later saw in the news that (Covid-19 had) spread to all the other coun­tries in the world.”</p>
    <p>New pro­to­cols were in­tro­duced. Be­fore board­ing, they would ra­dio the ship’s cap­tain to ask if all crew mem­bers were feel­ing well and to en­sure ev­ery­one wore face masks.</p>
    <p>MSG Kevin, 30, said crew typ­i­cally com­ply with in­struc­tions.</p>
    <p>AS­SeT of­fi­cers also don ex­tra per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, in­clud­ing N95 masks, la­tex gloves un­der­neath reg­u­lar com­bat gloves, and gog­gles, for pro­tec­tion when in­ter­act­ing with ship crew.</p>
    <p>Don­ning the N95 masks posed a chal­lenge. Said MSG Kevin: “Our gear, with every­thing, is about 15kg to 20kg. And then we have to climb up the... Ja­cob’s Ladder, which is about 6m to 7m. With the N95 mask on, by the time you are on board the ship, you are very breath­less.”</p>
    <p>The ves­sels are of­ten huge, so of­fi­cers usu­ally have to take another five to six flights of stairs just to get to the bridge, which is the con­trol cen­tre of the ship.</p>
