    <p>Malaysia’s se­nior min­is­ter Azmin Ali and 10 other MPs have for­mally joined Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s po­lit­i­cal party, a move that should strengthen Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia amid con­tin­u­ing po­lit­i­cal tur­bu­lence in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The group of 11 fed­eral law­mak­ers had been in­de­pen­dent MPs in the past five months after leav­ing Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) fol­low­ing a bit­ter power tus­sle with its pres­i­dent An­war Ibrahim.</p>
    <p>“Sin­cerely, on this sa­cred evening, my­self and the ‘war­riors’ from Perlis to Sabah... hereby de­clare to join Ber­satu. We sup­port the lead­er­ship of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin,” Datuk Seri Azmin said, in a speech at a congress at­tended by the Premier in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>“Now is the time to ‘ ber­satu’ (unite). Ber­satu for the na­tion. Ber­satu for Malaysia,” Mr Azmin said, to rous­ing cheers from the meet­ing hall which was filled with some 2,500 sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Three of the 11 former PKR MPs are Cab­i­net min­is­ters i n the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment – Se­nior Min­is­ter for Econ­omy Azmin, Hous­ing and Lo­cal Gov­ern­ment Min­is­ter Zu­raida Ka­marud­din and Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and Mul­ti­me­dia Min­is­ter Sai­fud­din Ab­dul­lah. Their de­ci­sion to join Ber­satu raises its to­tal num­ber of law­mak­ers to 32.</p>
    <p>The years-long feud be­tween Mr Azmin, the former PKR deputy pres­i­dent, and Datuk Seri An­war had steadily built up over the years and turned per­sonal after a vi­ral sex video al­legedly in­volv­ing Mr Azmin with another man made its rounds in June last year. Mr Azmin and his fac­tion blamed the An­war fac­tion for the video, which they said was fake.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war had said Mr Azmin should re­sign if he was in­deed one of the two men fea­tured in the video, which prompted the lat­ter to tell his former boss to “look in the mir­ror”. Mr An­war twice went to jail over claims of hav­ing had sex with men, a crime in Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The Fe­bru­ary de­fec­tion of the 11</p>
    <p>MPs com­bined with the de­fec­tion of most Ber­satu law­mak­ers caused the col­lapse of the 22-month-old Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) gov­ern­ment, then led by premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad.</p>
    <p>“We were headed for trou­ble two years ago (when PH won the gen­eral elec­tion). Our roles were sup­posed to be dif­fer­ent, we were sup­posed to care for the peo­ple but we were busy bick­er­ing on who should be the next prime min­is­ter,” said Madam Zu­raida in her speech, re­fer­ring to ten­sions in PH be­tween Tun Dr Ma­hathir and Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>“In our cri­sis to de­cide on who to back... we made the right choice by sup­port­ing Tan Sri Muhyid­din as PM,” she added.</p>
    <p>At the congress, Mr Muhyid­din, who is pres­i­dent of Ber­satu, re­vealed that the Malay-based party is propos­ing a new chap­ter to ac­com­mo­date and al­low non-Malay lead­ers to con­trib­ute and hold po­si­tions in the party. A com­mit­tee led by its Supreme Coun­cil mem­ber Rais Ya­tim has been formed to look into the process.</p>
    <p>“We pro­pose a new chap­ter that could help af­fil­i­ated mem­bers con­trib­ute ideas and hold lead­er­ship po­si­tions. The com­mit­tee un­der Tan Sri Rais will look into it and bring up the mat­ter to the Supreme Coun­cil,” he said in his speech.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din said that should the pro­posal be ac­cepted, there would be an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing to amend Ber­satu’s Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu to­day faces two ma­jor chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>One is de­fec­tions from its ranks to a new party be­ing formed by Dr Ma­hathir – Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air. The other is be­ing ac­cepted fully by its en­e­mies-turned-al­lies in Umno and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS).</p>
    <p>Though both Umno and PAS are in the same PN gov­ern­ment to­day, there re­main sus­pi­cions be­tween all three al­lied par­ties five months into their po­lit­i­cal mar­riage. Umno has in­di­cated it would not be­come an of­fi­cial mem­ber of PN.</p>
    <p>This is partly due to the fact that of the 32 Ber­satu MPs, 14 were law­mak­ers who de­fected from Umno and another 11 from long-time op­po­si­tion party PKR.</p>
