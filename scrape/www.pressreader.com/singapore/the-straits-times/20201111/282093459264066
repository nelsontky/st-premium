    <p>Com­pa­nies will have to be nim­ble and trans­form their busi­ness mod­els with dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy to join the e-com­merce band­wagon, if they want to re­main rel­e­vant in a rapidly ad­vanc­ing dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This and other top­ics were cov­ered in a we­bi­nar ses­sion yes­ter­day for about 800 young Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>The main speaker was Mr Ho Suu Wei, who is on­line pay­ments provider Pay­Pal’s South-east Asia gov­ern­ment re­la­tions direc­tor.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s ses­sion – the sec­ond of seven – also touched on the im­por­tance of data pro­tec­tion amid dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The we­bi­nar se­ries is the first event to be rolled out un­der the Asia-Ready Ex­po­sure Pro­gramme (AEP) first an­nounced in Fe­bru­ary by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme aims to equip young Sin­ga­pore­ans with cross­cul­tural skills, and help them bet­ter un­der­stand Asean, China and In­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said then that more Sin­ga­porean stu­dents from in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing would have the chance to go abroad, and had set a tar­get for 70 per cent of them to gain overseas ex­po­sure, up from about half of all stu­dents from lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties, poly­tech­nics and the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion cur­rently.</p>
    <p>The Asia-Ready we­bi­nar se­ries was launched last month by the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil, in part­ner­ship with the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs and Asean Busi­ness Youth As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The se­ries will run till March next year, and give youth in­sights into is­sues and op­por­tu­ni­ties in Asia, en­hance their ap­pre­ci­a­tion for the re­gion and equip them with rel­e­vant knowl­edge in the evolv­ing so­cioe­co­nomic cli­mate.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the di­a­logue, Mr Ho said the rise in e-com­merce and dig­i­tal pay­ments has changed the way peo­ple live and work.</p>
    <p>If mer­chants are not able to trans­form their busi­ness mod­els fast enough by em­brac­ing dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy to jump on the e-com­merce band­wagon, “they might find them­selves in some sort of trou­ble”, he added.</p>
    <p>Prime lo­ca­tions of phys­i­cal shops used to be a key busi­ness dif­fer­en­tia­tor, but this is no longer the case, he noted.</p>
    <p>“(In the past), if mer­chants had a strate­gic lo­ca­tion with good hu­man traf­fic, their busi­nesses were likely to do bet­ter... Now, the con­sid­er­a­tions have changed with ecom­merce sites and so­cial me­dia plat­forms,” said Mr Ho.</p>
    <p>“If you are fa­mil­iar with on­line mar­ket­ing, dis­tri­bu­tion and lo­gis­tics, the world is lit­er­ally your oys­ter.”</p>
    <p>Un­der the AEP, par­tic­i­pants will also take on e-learn­ing mod­ules to learn more about the lan­guages and cul­tures of Asean, China and In­dia.</p>
    <p>They will have to work on a lo­cal pro­ject cu­rated by AEP or­gan­is­ers to broaden their ex­po­sure to Asia’s grow­ing economies, as well as at­tend fa­cil­i­tated de­brief ses­sions to re­flect and share about the AEP ex­pe­ri­ence with their peers.</p>
    <p>(In the past), if mer­chants had a strate­gic lo­ca­tion with good hu­man traf­fic, their busi­nesses were likely to do bet­ter... Now, the con­sid­er­a­tions have changed with e-com­merce sites and so­cial me­dia plat­forms. If you are fa­mil­iar with on­line mar­ket­ing, dis­tri­bu­tion and lo­gis­tics, the ’’ world is lit­er­ally your oys­ter.</p>
    <p>MR HO SUU WEI, Pay­Pal’s South-east Asia gov­ern­ment re­la­tions direc­tor, say­ing that prime lo­ca­tions of phys­i­cal shops used to be a key busi­ness dif­fer­en­tia­tor but this is no longer so.</p>
