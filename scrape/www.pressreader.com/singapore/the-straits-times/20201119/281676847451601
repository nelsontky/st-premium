    <p>NEW YORK • Roche Hold­ing has com­pleted early tests of its abil­ity to pro­duce large quan­ti­ties of Re­gen­eron Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals’ Covid-19 an­ti­body treat­ment, putting it on track to be­gin man­u­fac­tur­ing the drug once it is au­tho­rised by reg­u­la­tors, Re­gen­eron has said.</p>
    <p>The ex­per­i­men­tal ther­apy was used to treat United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump last month.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies aim to be able to make two mil­lion doses of the an­ti­body cock­tail next year, but are await­ing clear­ance from reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>Roche “has al­ready started engi­neer­ing runs at scale and (has) been suc­cess­ful”, Re­gen­eron pres­i­dent and chief sci­en­tific of­fi­cer Ge­orge Yan­copou­los said in an in­ter­view on Tues­day, ahead of this week’s Reuters To­tal Health con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>A Roche spokesman said the Swiss drug­maker would be ready to be­gin pro­duc­ing the treat­ment in the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>Re­gen­eron has had dis­cus­sions with the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion al­most every day since it sub­mit­ted its ap­pli­ca­tion for emer­gency use of the Covid-19 drug last month, and ex­pects a fi­nal de­ci­sion in the “very near fu­ture”, Mr Yan­copou­los, a co-founder of the US biotech com­pany, said.</p>
    <p>Re­gen­eron hopes to ap­ply for full ap­proval of the drug shortly af­ter­wards, he said, echo­ing his com­ment dur­ing Re­gen­eron’s in­vestor call ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has a con­tract to pro­vide 300,000 doses of the an­ti­body ther­apy, called REGNCOV2, to the US gov­ern­ment and ex­pects to be able to meet that com­mit­ment by as early as Jan­uary. It has more than 50,000 doses cur­rently stock­piled.</p>
    <p>The two mil­lion doses Re­gen­eron ex­pects to be able to pro­duce in part­ner­ship with Roche next year may not be enough to treat all the pa­tients world­wide who could ben­e­fit from it, Mr Yan­copou­los said, based on the rate at which the virus is again spread­ing and sick­en­ing peo­ple glob­ally.</p>
    <p>He added that Re­gen­eron is in talks with US of­fi­cials about pro­vid­ing more doses than it has al­ready agreed to, but has not reached any con­clu­sive agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Re­gen­eron’s cur­rent con­tract with the US gov­ern­ment priced 300,000 doses at US$450 mil­lion (S$604 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Re­gen­eron has been speak­ing reg­u­larly with US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den’s Covid-19 task force and has shown them a pre­sen­ta­tion on the an­ti­body treat­ment, Mr Yan­copou­los said.</p>
    <p>After Mr Trump re­ceived the Re­gen­eron treat­ment along with sev­eral other medicines dur­ing his bout with Covid-19, he touted it as a vir­tual “cure” for the ill­ness, promis­ing to make it free for Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>Re­gen­eron has had dis­cus­sions with the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion al­most every day since it sub­mit­ted its ap­pli­ca­tion for emer­gency use of the Covid-19 drug last month, and ex­pects a fi­nal de­ci­sion in the “very near fu­ture”, Mr Ge­orge Yan­copou­los, a co-founder of the US biotech com­pany, said.</p>
