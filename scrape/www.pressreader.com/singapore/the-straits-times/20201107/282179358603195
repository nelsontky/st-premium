    <p>The United States’ prob­lems won’t be over when the slow-mo­tion train wreck of the elec­tion is fi­nally con­cluded and, as now seems likely, Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den sits be­hind the desk in the Oval Of­fice.</p>
    <p>As pres­i­dent, Mr Bi­den will come to power di­min­ished by the nar­row­ness of his vic­tory over Repub­li­can ri­val Don­ald Trump. He will also face some of the most daunt­ing prob­lems ever to con­front a US pres­i­dent. Many are ob­vi­ous – a rag­ing pan­demic, a con­va­les­cent econ­omy and a deeply di­vided so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>But per­haps the most daunt­ing and po­ten­tially dan­ger­ous ques­tion on the pres­i­dent’s desk is not so ob­vi­ous. It is what to do if China uses force against Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>That is far from a hy­po­thet­i­cal ques­tion these days, as ris­ing ten­sions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing are be­ing echoed and am­pli­fied in the Tai­wan Strait.</p>
    <p>If a cri­sis erupts there, the pres­i­dent would con­front a bru­tally stark and sim­ple choice, be­cause ques­tions of peace and war sel­dom al­low for nu­ance. Ei­ther he sends in the US mil­i­tary to help de­fend Tai­wan, or he doesn’t.</p>
    <p>If he decides to fight for Tai­wan, he would start a war with China which the US is not guar­an­teed to win. It would quickly be­come a full-scale con­flict, and quite pos­si­bly cross the nu­clear thresh­old. If that hap­pened, no one could be sure that the US it­self might not suf­fer nu­clear at­tack.</p>
    <p>But the con­se­quences of not help­ing Tai­wan would also be dis­as­trous. The US’ abil­ity and will­ing­ness to de­fend Tai­wan loom as the ul­ti­mate test of its strate­gic lead­er­ship in Asia. Al­though it has no for­mal treaty com­mit­ments to do so, Amer­i­can lead­ers and pol­i­cy­mak­ers have for decades en­cour­aged US al­lies in Asia to as­sume that it would do what­ever it took to de­fend Tai­wan from any un­pro­voked Chi­nese at­tack.</p>
    <p>If the US failed to live up to these ex­pec­ta­tions, the cred­i­bil­ity of its for­mal se­cu­rity com­mit­ments to al­lies like Ja­pan, South Korea, the Philip­pines and Aus­tralia would be fa­tally com­pro­mised. That in turn would un­der­mine the US’ po­si­tion as the re­gion’s pri­mary power, be­cause those al­liances pro­vide the op­er­a­tional ac­cess and the po­lit­i­cal sup­port which are es­sen­tial to sus­tain­ing the US mil­i­tary pres­ence in the re­gion so far from home.</p>
    <p>CHINA’S CAL­CU­LA­TIONS</p>
    <p>The risk of a US-China con­fronta­tion over Tai­wan is higher to­day than it has been for over 50 years. That is partly be­cause Bei­jing is be­com­ing wor­ried and im­pa­tient. Lead­ers in Bei­jing re­main as com­mit­ted as ever to even­tu­ally bring­ing Tai­wan un­der Bei­jing’s rule, but time is not on their side. Tai­wan Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen’s vic­tory in the Tai­wanese pres­i­den­tial elec­tion ear­lier this year con­firmed that public opin­ion there is be­com­ing more and more hos­tile to the idea of any form of ac­com­mo­da­tion with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Last year’s un­rest in Hong Kong, and Bei­jing’s stern re­sponse, have only con­firmed to anx­ious Tai­wanese that their hard-won po­lit­i­cal free­doms would not sur­vive “re­uni­fi­ca­tion”. So the longer China de­lays, the harder it will be to im­pose its rule. Many in Bei­jing must there­fore be urg­ing de­ci­sive ac­tion soon, and given at­ti­tudes in Tai­wan that could only mean us­ing force.</p>
    <p>What are Bei­jing’s op­tions? Clearly an out­right in­va­sion of the is­land would be very de­mand­ing, even for China’s rapidly de­vel­op­ing armed forces. It is much more likely to im­pose an air and naval block­ade which would paral­yse Tai­wan, bring its econ­omy to a stand­still, and hope­fully com­pel Taipei to sur­ren­der.</p>
    <p>This strat­egy would have the ad­van­tage that China could avoid fir­ing the first shots. That would be the re­spon­si­bil­ity of who­ever first tried to break the block­ade, whether Tai­wan it­self or the US.</p>
    <p>That points to an­other rea­son why Bei­jing might well be tempted to ini­ti­ate this kind of cri­sis over the next few years. Not only would it break the log­jam over Tai­wan’s fu­ture and of­fer Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping the glory of bring­ing this “rene­gade prov­ince” back into China, it would also of­fer a golden op­por­tu­nity to test the US’ re­solve by con­fronting Amer­i­can lead­ers with pre­cisely the dread­ful choice out­lined above.</p>
    <p>Of course China’s lead­ers do not want a war with the US, but they are will­ing to take risks by act­ing provoca­tively when they be­lieve Wash­ing­ton will not be pre­pared to re­spond ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>They have been do­ing this for years in the South China Sea, demon­strat­ing their grow­ing power by build­ing is­land bases in de­fi­ance of the US, and cal­cu­lat­ing cor­rectly that Wash­ing­ton would not be will­ing to risk a con­flict by re­spond­ing de­ci­sively to stop them.</p>
    <p>De­fy­ing the US over Tai­wan would take this tac­tic to a whole new level, run­ning greater risks but of­fer­ing greater re­wards in un­der­min­ing US cred­i­bil­ity in Asia.</p>
    <p>Those risks look worth run­ning be­cause Bei­jing has grown in­creas­ingly con­fi­dent that the US has no cred­i­ble mil­i­tary op­tions to win a war over Tai­wan. And that is be­cause China has in­vested mas­sively in new air and naval ca­pa­bil­i­ties that can tar­get power-pro­jec­tion forces such as the air­craft car­ri­ers that the US would rely on to fight off China’s coast.</p>
    <p>Twenty years ago, US com­man­ders could prom­ise a swift and de­ci­sive vic­tory in any war over Tai­wan, but to­day they can­not. And the less likely they are to win a swift vic­tory, the less likely it is that the US will choose to fight.</p>
    <p>That is es­pe­cially true be­cause any US-China war could go nu­clear. No one knows pre­cisely how that could hap­pen, but it is clearly a risk in any es­ca­lat­ing con­flict be­tween two nu­clear-armed pow­ers. The US still re­serves the right to use nu­clear weapons first against an ad­ver­sary like China if it can­not win with con­ven­tional forces, but that would risk Chi­nese nu­clear re­tal­i­a­tion against Amer­i­can cities.</p>
    <p>And it is not im­pos­si­ble that China might choose to cross the nu­clear thresh­old first to tar­get US bases in Asia, risk­ing US re­tal­i­a­tion against China. These dan­gers must weigh heav­ily with US lead­ers, and en­cour­age the Chi­nese to con­clude that the US would step back from Asia rather than risk a war over Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Some of this is clearly un­der­stood by Amer­i­can pol­i­cy­mak­ers and an­a­lysts, which is why ten­sions over Tai­wan are be­ing ratch­eted up from the US side too. Like the Chi­nese, they see that Tai­wan is the ul­ti­mate test­ing ground for their con­test with China over strate­gic lead­er­ship in Asia.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, as an­i­mos­ity to­wards China has mounted in Wash­ing­ton, the US has in­creas­ingly matched Bei­jing’s provoca­tive ac­tions with provo­ca­tions of its own.</p>
    <p>High-level US of­fi­cials have vis­ited Tai­wan in de­fi­ance of long­stand­ing agree­ments with China, and arms sales to Tai­wan have been ramped up.</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tantly, there has been a grow­ing move in Congress to re­move the de­lib­er­ate am­bi­gu­ity in the US’ for­mal com­mit­ment by stat­ing cat­e­gor­i­cally that the coun­try would de­fend Tai­wan from China. That would, of course, be very provoca­tive for China. The ad­vo­cates of this pro­posal ar­gue that it would con­vince China not to gam­ble on the US step­ping back from a con­flict.</p>
    <p>They be­lieve China doubts the US’ re­solve be­cause US dec­la­ra­tions are am­bigu­ous. They as­sume that the US would still eas­ily win a war with China, de­spite the clear con­sen­sus in the Pen­tagon that this is no longer true, and they also as­sume that the Chi­nese share this view.</p>
    <p>These as­sump­tions are wrong and very dan­ger­ous, be­cause they en­cour­age US pol­i­cy­mak­ers to es­ca­late the con­fronta­tion over Tai­wan while un­der­es­ti­mat­ing the risk that China will call Wash­ing­ton’s bluff and re­sort to force. Once that hap­pens, the pres­i­dent would find him­self con­fronting that dis­as­trous choice be­tween an un­winnable war and an ig­no­min­ious re­treat.</p>
    <p>How can this be avoided? To ex­plore this, we need to step back from the Tai­wan is­sue it­self and see the big­ger pic­ture of what is hap­pen­ing in Asia.</p>
    <p>The US’ dilemma over Tai­wan is sim­ply a re­flec­tion of the fun­da­men­tal trans­for­ma­tion of the strate­gic sit­u­a­tion in Asia that has re­sulted from China’s rise. China to­day is a truly for­mi­da­ble ri­val that can im­pose very high costs and risks on the US in its own back­yard. That forces the US to re­think whether it any longer makes sense to shoul­der those costs and risks – in­clud­ing the risk of a ma­jor un­winnable war – to pre­serve its old ac­cus­tomed place in Asia.</p>
    <p>If not, then step­ping back now with a mea­sure of de­lib­er­a­tion and dig­nity, rather than in the heat and hu­mil­i­a­tion of a cri­sis, might be a smarter move. If Mr Bi­den finds his way to the Oval Of­fice, that is one ques­tion he has to pon­der: What price sus­tain­ing the no­tion of the US as the re­gion’s hege­mon?</p>
