    <p>Work­ers’ Party (WP) MP Sylvia Lim will not be speak­ing on the high­pro­file case in­volv­ing for­mer maid Parti Liyani, who was re­cently ac­quit­ted of theft, when Par­lia­ment sits on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng will speak on the topic of pro­tec­tion against se­cond-hand cig­a­rette smoke in homes in his ad­journ­ment mo­tion.</p>
    <p>Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin said in a Face­book post yesterday that Ms Lim and Mr Ng were at Par­lia­ment to wit­ness the bal­lot­ing, which Mr Ng won.</p>
    <p>When more than one MP have sub­mit­ted an ad­journ­ment mo­tion, the MP who gets to speak at a sit­ting is de­cided by bal­lot.</p>
    <p>Three other MPs had also sub­mit­ted ad­journ­ment mo­tions, which is meant to raise ad­di­tional mat­ters of public con­cern and is al­lot­ted to one MP for each Par­lia­ment sit­ting.</p>
    <p>The trio are Ms Denise Phua (Jalan Be­sar GRC), Ms Car­rie Tan (Nee Soon GRC), and Dr Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah (Jalan Be­sar GRC).</p>
    <p>Ms Parti’s crim­i­nal case, in which the fam­ily of prom­i­nent busi­ness chief Liew Mun Leong ac­cused her of steal­ing items to­talling $34,000, has sparked an up­roar after a High Court judge found, on ap­peal, that her con­vic­tion by the trial judge to be “un­safe” for var­i­ous rea­sons. Th­ese in­cluded the way the po­lice han­dled the ev­i­dence and the mo­tive be­hind the ac­cu­sa­tions made by some mem­bers of the Liew fam­ily. It led to ques­tions raised about the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem’s treat­ment of peo­ple who are less well-off.</p>
    <p>The is­sue, how­ever, looks set to be dis­cussed at Mon­day’s sit­ting as sev­eral MPs have filed par­lia­men­tary ques­tions on the case. They in­clude Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok), Mr Vikram Nair (Sem­bawang GRC) and Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC).</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Home and Law Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam had also said he would make a min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment on the mat­ter but did not spec­ify when.</p>
    <p>The ad­journ­ment mo­tion filed by Ms Lim, MP for Alju­nied GRC, is ti­tled “Jus­tice For All: En­hanc­ing Eq­uity in the Crim­i­nal Jus­tice Sys­tem”. It is meant to dis­cuss as­pects of the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem and the chal­lenges faced by per­sons of less means in nav­i­gat­ing it.</p>
    <p>An ad­journ­ment mo­tion takes place at the end of the sit­ting, with 20 min­utes al­lo­cated to the MP and 10 min­utes for the Min­is­ter to re­spond. Those not cho­sen can be re­sub­mit­ted for the bal­lot to take place for the next sit­ting.</p>
    <p>As for Mr Ng’s mo­tion for the Oct 5 sit­ting, he said in a Face­book post on Sept 12 that more peo­ple have been af­fected by se­cond-hand smoke, such as dur­ing and after the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod ear­lier this year, and asked for feed­back on the is­sue.</p>
