    <p>At the start of the Covid-19 pan­demic, Mr Cai Yinzhou, 30, re­alised that mi­grant work­ers liv­ing close to­gether in dor­mi­to­ries were es­pe­cially vul­ner­a­ble to in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Many did not un­der­stand the of­fi­cial ad­vi­sories. There was some con­fu­sion and anx­i­ety when the first few work­ers caught the virus.</p>
    <p>Mr Cai penned a list of rec­om­men­da­tions on what should be done to keep th­ese work­ers safe. His sug­ges­tions, which he posted on Face­book, in­cluded re­duc­ing the num­bers liv­ing to­gether, is­su­ing masks and stricter en­force­ment of hy­giene stan­dards in large dorms with over 1,000 work­ers.</p>
    <p>The post came more than a month be­fore the first clus­ter out­break in the largest dorms. When that hap­pened, his note and other ef­forts helped raise aware­ness about the work­ers’ liv­ing con­di­tions, and spurred more ef­forts and re­sources to sup­port them.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Covid-19 hit Sin­ga­pore’s shores, Mr Cai was play­ing a part in sup­port­ing the mi­grant worker com­mu­nity here. Grow­ing up in Gey­lang, he made friends with mi­grant work­ers in the area, bond­ing over games of bad­minton and vol­ley­ball. He learnt more about their lives here, and the fam­i­lies they missed back home. He was also deeply af­fected by their con­cerns and what they had at stake as sole bread­win­ners.</p>
    <p>Mr Cai set up and cur­rently runs Cit­i­zen Ad­ven­tures, which con­ducts tours for peo­ple who want to un­der­stand so­cial ecosys­tems, and so­cial ini­tia­tives such as Back­alley Bar­bers, which of­fers free hair­cuts to mi­grant work­ers, nurs­ing home res­i­dents and those who can­not af­ford to go to a bar­ber.</p>
    <p>He plans to con­tinue to en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore­ans to think about their priv­i­leged po­si­tion in re­la­tion to so­cial in­equities and the en­vi­ron­ment. “The work lies in prac­ti­cal ini­tia­tives to serve a par­tic­u­lar need, am­pli­fy­ing that through so­cial me­dia, ral­ly­ing peo­ple to­gether for a cause and then hav­ing con­ver­sa­tions... and mov­ing the nee­dle on the is­sue,” he said.</p>
