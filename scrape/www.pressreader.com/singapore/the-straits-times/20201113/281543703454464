    <p>A former prop­erty agent was sen­tenced to death yes­ter­day af­ter he was found guilty of mur­der­ing his preg­nant wife and their four-year-old daugh­ter. Teo Ghim Heng (pic­tured left in 2017) stran­gled his wife, who was six months preg­nant, and daugh­ter at their Wood­lands flat on Jan 20, 2017.</p>
    <p>A former prop­erty agent was sen­tenced to death yes­ter­day af­ter he was found guilty of mur­der­ing his preg­nant wife and their four-yearold daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>“This is a tragic case. It is a case of lives lost, a fam­ily torn asun­der,” said High Court judge Kannan Ramesh in de­liv­er­ing his de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Teo Ghim Heng, 45, had stran­gled his wife Choong Pei Shan, 39, a house­wife who was six months preg­nant, and daugh­ter Zi Ning in their Wood­lands flat on Jan 20, 2017. He spent a week with their bod­ies in the flat be­fore set­ting the corpses on fire, the court heard in a trial that started in July last year.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Ramesh con­victed Teo of two counts of mur­der, which carry the manda­tory death penalty.</p>
    <p>The judge re­jected the de­fence’s ar­gu­ments that Teo was suf­fer­ing from de­pres­sion, and that he had been pro­voked and lost con­trol af­ter his wife called him “use­less” in front of their daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Teo and Madam Choong mar­ried in 2009. It was the sec­ond mar­riage for both. He used to be a suc­cess­ful prop­erty agent but in 2015, his in­come dropped due to a down­turn in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In late 2016, he took on an­other job as a sales co­or­di­na­tor at a ren­o­va­tion com­pany. But the fam­ily’s ex­penses re­mained un­changed as Teo had a gam­bling habit.</p>
    <p>By the end of 2016, he was sad­dled with a debt of about $120,000 and had even listed the flat for sale.</p>
    <p>On Jan 18, 2017, the cou­ple ar­gued over the fam­ily’s fi­nances. Dur­ing the quar­rel, he brought up an ex­tra­mar­i­tal af­fair that Madam Choong had in 2014.</p>
    <p>On the morn­ing of Jan 20, 2017, Teo de­cided not to send Zi Ning to school as her fees were over­due.</p>
    <p>On learn­ing this, Madam Choong be­rated Teo for be­ing use­less.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Teo, a “red mist” de­scended upon him and his mind went blank. He stran­gled her with a bath towel be­fore us­ing his bare hands to make sure she was dead. He then stran­gled his daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Jus­tice Ramesh said Teo’s be­hav­iour be­fore and af­ter the of­fences did not paint a pic­ture of some­one who was suf­fer­ing from de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Among other things, the judge said Teo’s fre­quent vis­its to porno­graphic web­sites be­fore and af­ter he killed his wife and daugh­ter did not square with his claims that he had lost in­ter­est in sex.</p>
    <p>The judge noted that af­ter the killings, Teo spent his time surf­ing the Web and watch­ing videos, left the house for meals when he was hun­gry, and slept reg­u­lar hours.</p>
    <p>“There did not ap­pear to be, on the ev­i­dence, any mourn­ing or de­spon­dency on the part of the ac­cused, de­spite the demise of his wife and child,” he said.</p>
    <p>The judge also noted Teo’s mul­ti­ple lies. To buy him­self time when Madam Choong’s fam­ily was look­ing for her, Teo changed her Face­book cover photo to keep up the fa­cade that she was alive.</p>
    <p>Teo also fab­ri­cated four “sui­cide notes” and later lied to the po­lice that Madam Choong had a hand in writ­ing them.</p>
    <p>TRAGIC CASE</p>
    <p>This is a tragic case. It is a case of lives lost, a fam­ily torn asun­der.</p>
    <p>HIGH COURT JUDGE KANNAN RAMESH, in de­liv­er­ing his de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>NO SIGN OF DE­SPON­DENCY</p>
    <p>There did not ap­pear to be, on the ev­i­dence, any mourn­ing or de­spon­dency on the part of the ac­cused, de­spite the demise of his wife and child.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Ramesh said the se­quence of events clearly showed that Teo was in full con­trol of his fac­ul­ties when he stran­gled his wife and daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>In court, Teo said the process of stran­gling Madam Choong took 10 to 15 min­utes.</p>
    <p>As he stran­gled her, he told her in Man­darin: “We owe too much money, you leave first. Zi Ning and I will join you shortly. I don’t want</p>
    <p>you and Zi Ning to have to bear the bur­den of my debt af­ter I (am) gone.”</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Ramesh said Teo’s con­duct was “con­scious, de­lib­er­ate and out­come-driven, cer­tainly af­ter the mist had cleared”.</p>
    <p>As for Zi Ning, Teo had asked the girl to sit on his lap be­fore stran­gling her, and as she strug­gled, he told her that he would join her.</p>
    <p>“Such be­hav­iour shows full con</p>
    <p>trol on the part of the ac­cused... He knew ex­actly what he was do­ing, and his ac­tions were goal-ori­en­tated,” said the judge.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Teo’s dou­ble mur­der con­vic­tion, a third charge of killing his un­born son was with­drawn by the prose­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>Teo’s lawyers said he in­tends to ap­peal against the court’s de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>JUS­TICE RAMESH, who said the ac­cused’s be­hav­iour be­fore and af­ter the of­fences did not paint a pic­ture of some­one suf­fer­ing from de­pres­sion.</p>
