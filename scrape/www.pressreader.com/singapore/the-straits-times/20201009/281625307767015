    <p>ONLY OP­TION NOW</p>
    <p>I have never been on a cruise pre-Covid-19 be­cause I would rather fly, but now that I have no choice, I will take what­ever op­tion I can get.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple have clearly split views about whether it is safe to go on up­com­ing cruises to nowhere that have re­ceived the of­fi­cial nod.</p>
    <p>An on­line poll of more than 1,000 Straits Times read­ers showed that 51 per cent gave it the thumbs up, and 49 per cent, the thumbs down.</p>
    <p>The naysay­ers cite a lack of con­fi­dence about the safety mea­sures in place against the coro­n­avirus, while the en­thu­si­asts say it is a wel­come get­away at a time when other forms of travel are not an op­tion.</p>
    <p>Data en­gi­neer Thng Kai Ting, 24, sees it as the only way to en­joy a sense of “get­ting away”. “I have never been on a cruise pre-Covid-19 be­cause I would rather fly, but now that I have no choice, I will take what­ever op­tion I can get.”</p>
    <p>A gen­eral prac­ti­tioner, who wanted to be known only as Dr Lua, 39, cited the difficulty of co­or­di­nat­ing and man­ag­ing ac­tiv­i­ties such as meal times.</p>
    <p>“Even with half the num­ber of guests, you are still go­ing to have hun­dreds of peo­ple eat­ing at the same time,” he added. “There are still a lot of un­knowns, and with many peo­ple in a con­fined space – I am not sure it is a good idea.”</p>
    <p>They were com­ment­ing on the</p>
    <p>DATA EN­GI­NEER THNG KAI TING</p>
    <p>go-ahead that Gent­ing Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional have re­ceived from the au­thor­i­ties to of­fer cruises to nowhere from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But they have to fol­low a strict set of guide­lines to pre­vent the on­board spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>These in­clude cater­ing only to Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents and at a re­duced ca­pac­ity of 50 per cent, con­duct­ing Covid-19 tests be­fore board­ing, strict and fre­quent clean­ing and san­i­ta­tion on board and en­sur­ing no re­cir­cu­la­tion of air on the ship.</p>
    <p>Cruise ships have been hot spots for the Covid-19 virus, es­pe­cially in the ini­tial months of the pan­demic ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>One in­ci­dent that cap­tured the world’s at­ten­tion was the Di­a­mond</p>
    <p>Princess which docked in Yoko­hama with about 3,700 peo­ple who were quar­an­tined on board. More than 700 of them were in­fected.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts noted the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board’s new safety mea­sures for the cruise lines are stricter than those for other at­trac­tions that are open here.</p>
    <p>“The safety mea­sures are more strin­gent than what is re­quired of ho­tels of­fer­ing stay­ca­tions,” said Pro­fes­sor Jeremy Lim, di­rec­tor of the Lead­er­ship In­sti­tute for Global Health Trans­for­ma­tion at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>Given the very low com­mu­nity preva­lence of the virus and the re­quire­ment of a neg­a­tive test be­fore board­ing, the risk of an in­fec­tion is low, Prof Lim said.</p>
    <p>“Also, while cruis­ing, pas­sen­gers will need to main­tain pub­lic health mea­sures such as wear­ing masks and be­ing so­cially dis­tant, moves that will fur­ther re­duce the risk of trans­mis­sion,” he added.</p>
    <p>Still, some, like Madam Julie Teo, who is self-em­ployed in the ship­ping business, are still wary.</p>
    <p>Said the 57-year-old: “I am not a big fan of cruises, but with­out Covid-19 around, I would not mind go­ing.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, I just don’t think it is safe to be stuck on a boat with the same peo­ple for a few days.”</p>
    <p>UN­SURE OF SAFETY</p>
    <p>Even with half the num­ber of guests, you are still go­ing to have hun­dreds of peo­ple eat­ing at the same time... There are still a lot of un­knowns, and with many peo­ple in a con­fined space – I am not sure it is a good idea.</p>
    <p>DR LUA, a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner.</p>
