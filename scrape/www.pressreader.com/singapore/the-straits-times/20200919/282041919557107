    <p>Lim Yok Lyn, 47, Sin­ga­pore Straits Wine Com­pany’s CEO at the time, and its head of op­er­a­tions Yip Kin Chee, 74, are ac­cused of abet­ting one of their sales ex­ec­u­tives Mi­cael Mu­soni, 30, to pass the monies to Fa­rook Mo­hamed Faizal, 37, as an in­duce­ment to ad­vance the wine firm’s busi­ness in­ter­est with Cut By Wolf­gang Puck restau­rant.</p>
    <p>The chief ex­ec­u­tive of Sin­ga­pore Straits Wine Com­pany and its head of op­er­a­tions al­legedly abet­ted one of their sub­or­di­nates to give bribes to­talling more than $5,000 to a man who was then an as­sis­tant gen­eral man­ager at the Cut By Wolf­gang Puck restau­rant.</p>
    <p>Lim Yok Lyn, 47, the wine com­pany’s CEO at the time, and Yip Kin Chee, 74, are ac­cused of com­mit­ting the of­fences be­tween 2017 and 2018.</p>
    <p>Lim’s case was heard in a district court yes­ter­day and a search on the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity’s web­site re­veals that she no longer holds a di­rec­to­rial po­si­tion at the com­pany.</p>
    <p>The two Sin­ga­porean women are ac­cused of abet­ting one of the com­pany’s sales ex­ec­u­tives Mi­cael Mu­soni, 30, to pass the monies to Fa­rook Mo­hamed Faizal, 37, as an in­duce­ment to ad­vance the wine firm’s busi­ness in­ter­est with the restau­rant in Ma­rina Bay Sands.</p>
    <p>The duo are also ac­cused of abet­ting Mu­soni to cor­ruptly agree to of­fer a bribe of $970 to Fa­rook, an In­dian na­tional, in May 2018.</p>
    <p>Lim and Mu­soni, who is Ital­ian, each face eight graft charges, while Fa­rook faces seven.</p>
    <p>Yip had ear­lier been charged with 10 counts of cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, she al­legedly abet­ted the wine com­pany’s as­sis­tant sales man­ager Ee Chay Wea, 39, to give bribes to­talling more than $1,000 to a mar­ket­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager of Sin­cere Watch in May and June 2018.</p>
    <p>Ee, who is Malaysian, is said to have passed the monies to Chi­nese na­tional David Ang Wei Xiong, 33, as an in­duce­ment to ad­vance the wine com­pany’s busi­ness in­ter­est with Sin­cere Watch.</p>
    <p>Ee and Ang each face two graft charges.</p>
    <p>Fa­rook’s case has been ad­journed to next Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing the other five al­leged of­fend­ers have been ad­journed to next month.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of graft, an of­fender can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $100,000 for each charge.</p>
