    <p>SEOUL • The first panda to be born in South Korea was in­tro­duced to a group of chil­dren and re­porters yes­ter­day and given a name – Fu Bao, mean­ing lucky trea­sure.</p>
    <p>Fu Bao, born three months ago, ap­peared healthy and happy if a lit­tle shy as zookeep­ers pre­sented her to the chil­dren, who were wear­ing panda T-shirts and masks, at her home at the Ever­land theme park.</p>
    <p>“We love you, Fu Bao,” the chil­dren shouted. Fu Bao’s par­ents, seven-year-old fe­male Ai Bao and eight-year-old male Le Bao, ar­rived in 2016 from China’s Sichuan prov­ince, the home of giant pan­das, as part of China’s “panda diplo­macy”.</p>
    <p>Giant pan­das are one of the world’s most en­dan­gered species and the birth of a cub is some­thing to cel­e­brate.</p>
    <p>Fe­male pan­das can con­ceive only once a year within a lim­ited pe­riod, and cubs have very low chances of sur­vival as they are of­ten born pre­ma­turely, usu­ally weigh­ing less than 200g.</p>
    <p>Fu Bao weighed 197g and was 16.5cm long at birth but has grown fast. It now weighs 5.8kg and mea­sures 58.5cm, Ever­land said.</p>
    <p>“She’s grow­ing rapidly and started cut­ting her teeth and sit­ting up on her own ahead of her 100th day,” the zoo said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Some 50,000 peo­ple took part in a poll to choose Fu Bao’s name.</p>
    <p>The zoo said she would make her public de­but in com­ing weeks, when she can walk and eat bam­boo. She is ex­pected to re­turn to China in three or four years.</p>
