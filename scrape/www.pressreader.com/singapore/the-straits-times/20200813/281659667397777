    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat has as­sured busi­ness and union lead­ers that work­ers and com­pa­nies will con­tinue to get sup­port as the re­ces­sion deep­ens and the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) ends.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Fi­nance Min­is­ter, said he has been hav­ing in­ten­sive dis­cus­sions with govern­ment agen­cies to re­view and adjust these schemes as the sit­u­a­tion de­vel­ops.</p>
    <p>His com­ments are the first hint since the lat­est eco­nomic num­bers were re­leased on Tues­day that sup­port mea­sures may ta­per off rather than just come to a stop. Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy con­tracted 6.7 per cent in the first half of this year and is ex­pected to shrink by be­tween 5 per cent and 7 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said in a Face­book post last night that he and Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo, Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling, and labour chief Ng Chee Meng had spent the past two days meet­ing busi­ness and union lead­ers to dis­cuss the ef­fec­tive­ness of sup­port mea­sures the Govern­ment had rolled out in the last few months to help com­pa­nies keep their work­ers em­ployed.</p>
    <p>He noted that their dis­cus­sions took place against the back­drop of Sin­ga­pore’s worst quar­terly gross do­mes­tic prod­uct per­for­mance, and as some schemes like the JSS, which helps co-fund the first $4,600 of monthly wages of lo­cal work­ers, are end­ing soon.</p>
    <p>“Par­tic­i­pants ac­knowl­edged that these schemes can­not con­tinue in­def­i­nitely, but asked how sup­port for our busi­nesses and work­ers will change in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>“I as­sured them of our con­tin­ued com­mit­ment to sup­port our work­ers and com­pa­nies. I have also been hav­ing in­ten­sive dis­cus­sions with our agen­cies to re­view and evolve our schemes as the sit­u­a­tion de­vel­ops,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng added that while the road to eco­nomic re­cov­ery will be long and Covid-19’s im­pact on the labour mar­ket could yet deepen, it was up­lift­ing to hear of firms find­ing ways to cope with the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Some have piv­oted away from their cur­rent busi­nesses to new ar­eas that play to their core strengths.</p>
    <p>Many have ac­cel­er­ated their dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion plans and ex­panded their on­line of­fer­ings, he noted.</p>
    <p>“Some are sourc­ing for op­por­tu­ni­ties abroad through on­line busi­ness en­gage­ments. In the process, they are also reskilling their work­ers and re­design­ing jobs to take on these new op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Many ideas were also gen­er­ated on how to lever­age the tri­par­tite re­la­tion­ship be­tween the Govern­ment, labour unions and en­ter­prises to help Sin­ga­pore­ans build new skills and adapt to the post­Covid-19 world, he added.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, the grav­ity of our eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion weighed heav­ily on the minds of our busi­ness and union lead­ers,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>“The road ahead will be tough, but with de­ter­mi­na­tion and a spirit of en­ter­prise and col­lab­o­ra­tion, we can come out of this cri­sis stronger.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mrs Teo and her Man­power Min­istry col­leagues, Sec­ond Min­is­ter Tan See Leng and Se­nior Min­is­ter of State Zaqy Mo­hamad, also held a di­a­logue with young busi­ness lead­ers from the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try. Mrs Teo said the con­ver­sa­tion showed busi­ness lead­ers “had a pulse on the job sit­u­a­tion”, and raised ideas on ways to match more lo­cals with jobs in sec­tors such as re­new­able en­ergy and in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>She said: “I look for­ward to speak­ing to many more from the busi­ness com­mu­nity as we work to­gether to emerge stronger from the cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>ADAPT­ING TO THE SIT­U­A­TION</p>
    <p>I as­sured them of our con­tin­ued com­mit­ment to sup­port our work­ers and com­pa­nies. I have also been hav­ing in­ten­sive dis­cus­sions with our agen­cies to re­view and evolve our schemes as the sit­u­a­tion de­vel­ops. ’’</p>
