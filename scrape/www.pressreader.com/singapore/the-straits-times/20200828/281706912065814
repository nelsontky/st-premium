    <p>If there is one thing re­cent events have shown, it is that the sta­tus quo can­not be taken for granted – not when busi­ness as usual can be brought to its knees so eas­ily, and by a tiny foe.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore in­tends to rise to the chal­lenge posed by the coro­n­avirus with a fo­cus on sus­tain­able devel­op­ment, ac­cord­ing to plans set out by three min­istries yes­ter­day in their ad­denda to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>The Trans­port Min­istry, for one, wants to re­vive the ail­ing Changi air hub and strengthen the mar­itime sec­tor, even while supporting ini­tia­tives that aim to re­duce emis­sions in both ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­istry is help­ing the con­struc­tion sec­tor, hard hit by the pan­demic, get back on its feet again, so that green build­ings and other in­fra­struc­ture can be built amid a “city in na­ture”.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Sustainabi­lity and the En­vi­ron­ment is bolder yet, en­vi­sion­ing growth op­por­tu­ni­ties in a “low-car­bon and cli­matere­silient fu­ture” for Sin­ga­pore, a na­tion that re­lies on fos­sil fu­els for en­ergy and has a thriv­ing petro­chem­i­cal sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus on sustainabi­lity in recovery is timely.</p>
    <p>The rea­son: While the coro­n­avirus would even­tu­ally be tamed with medicines and vac­cines, the loom­ing threat of cli­mate change will per­sist and has to be dealt with.</p>
    <p>Chang­ing weather pat­terns and ex­treme weather events could have sim­i­lar im­pact on the world as Covid-19 – the loss of lives and liveli­hoods, strain on health­care sys­tems and global sup­ply chains, and shat­tered economies.</p>
    <p>But in Sin­ga­pore, the fo­cus on en­vi­ron­men­tal sustainabi­lity is not en­tirely new.</p>
    <p>Found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew had em­pha­sised the need for a clean en­vi­ron­ment from Sin­ga­pore’s in­fancy, and many ini­tia­tives have since been im­ple­mented to make Sin­ga­pore greener.</p>
    <p>Yet, the lat­est up­dates – with the fo­cus on the recovery of cer­tain sec­tors and cre­ation of jobs – have high­lighted the multi-di­men­sional na­ture of sustainabi­lity.</p>
    <p>Be­yond en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion, sustainabi­lity is also about en­sur­ing peo­ple here con­tinue to have jobs, and that Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety re­mains in­clu­sive and live­able.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can econ­o­mist Jef­frey Sachs noted that while sus­tain­able devel­op­ment was ini­tially a con­cept that cen­tred on how devel­op­ment should not threaten the needs of present and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions, it has evolved.</p>
    <p>It now fo­cuses more on link­ing economic devel­op­ment, so­cial in­clu­sion and en­vi­ron­men­tal sustainabi­lity, he wrote in his book The Age Of Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the spread of the coro­n­avirus has high­lighted the in­ter­sec­tion be­tween en­vi­ron­men­tal and hu­man health, and the im­pact on so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal sustainabi­lity is not new for Sin­ga­pore, but the pan­demic seems to have spurred a greater will­ing­ness to push the bound­aries.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said yes­ter­day the re­duced traf­fic and new travel pat­terns cre­ated by Covid-19 have opened a “win­dow of op­por­tu­nity to reimag­ine our road in­fra­struc­ture”.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, cer­tain un­der­used road lanes can be con­verted to cy­cling and bus lanes,” he said.</p>
    <p>There have also been ad hoc “car-free” events in Sin­ga­pore to pro­mote the na­tion’s car-lite vi­sion.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ong yes­ter­day floated the pos­si­bil­ity of pedes­tri­an­is­ing cer­tain roads.</p>
    <p>A low-car­bon fu­ture for Sin­ga­pore has been raised be­fore, al­though ear­lier dis­cus­sions of­ten cen­tred on the coun­try’s drive to tap more re­new­able en­ergy and boost­ing en­ergy ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, for­mer min­is­ter for the en­vi­ron­ment and wa­ter re­sources Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli had said that part of the petro­chem­i­cal sec­tor will re­main, even as Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to push the bound­aries on cut­ting emis­sions.</p>
    <p>But Ms Grace Fu, who took over Mr Masa­gos’ port­fo­lio in the re­cent Cab­i­net reshuf­fle that also saw the min­istry re­named to re­flect the greater role of sustainabi­lity, had high­lighted an­other as­pect of this vi­sion – the need for Sin­ga­pore to tran­si­tion, com­pet­i­tively, to a low-car­bon and cli­mate-re­silient fu­ture.</p>
    <p>She cited op­por­tu­ni­ties in de­car­bon­i­sa­tion, and grow­ing green in­dus­tries such as car­bon ser­vices and cli­mate science.</p>
    <p>At the open­ing of the 14th Par­lia­ment on Mon­day, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob spoke of over­com­ing Covid-19 with a push to­wards a green econ­omy and more sus­tain­able growth.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, three min­istries gave de­tails on how this could be done.</p>
    <p>The plans were en­cour­ag­ing, but the devil is in the de­tails.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus on sustainabi­lity in recovery is timely.</p>
    <p>The rea­son: While the coro­n­avirus would even­tu­ally be tamed with medicines and vac­cines, the loom­ing threat of cli­mate change will per­sist and has to be dealt with.</p>
