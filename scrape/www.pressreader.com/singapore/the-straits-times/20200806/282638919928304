    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Dis­ney’s muchde­layed block­buster Mu­lan will skip the big screen and premiere on stream­ing plat­form Dis­ney+ next month, it was an­nounced on Tues­day, as coron­avirus keeps the­atres shut across much of the United States.</p>
    <p>The un­prece­dented de­ci­sion – de­scribed by chief ex­ec­u­tive Bob Chapek as a “one-off” for a Dis­ney block­buster – is the lat­est ma­jor blow for movie the­atre chains al­ready reel­ing from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mu­lan, a mega-bud­get live ac­tion re­make of the tale of a leg­endary Chi­nese war­rior star­ring Liu Yifei, will be avail­able from Sept 4 in homes to Dis­ney+ sub­scribers for an ad­di­tional US$29.99 (S$41).</p>
    <p>“We see this as an op­por­tu­nity to bring this in­cred­i­ble film to a broad au­di­ence cur­rently un­able to go to movie the­atres, while also fur­ther en­hanc­ing the value and at­trac­tive­ness of a Dis­ney+ sub­scrip­tion,” Mr Chapek told an earn­ings call.</p>
    <p>The film will launch si­mul­ta­ne­ously in the­atres in ter­ri­to­ries such as China, which do not have Dis­ney+ launch plans. The move comes as a sec­ond wave of coron­avirus cases in the US stalls re­open­ing plans of the­atres in key mar­kets such as New York and Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, stu­dios typ­i­cally waited 90 days to re­lease ma­jor films dig­i­tally af­ter their the­atri­cal open­ings. But sev­eral ma­jor stu­dio movies, in­clud­ing Trolls World Tour (2020), have grossed tens of mil­lions dur­ing the pan­demic by aban­don­ing the­atri­cal re­leases and go­ing di­rectly to stream­ing – of­ten at pre­mium rental rates.</p>
    <p>“We are look­ing at Mu­lan as a one­off as op­posed to try­ing to say there is some new busi­ness win­dow model we are look­ing at”, said Mr Chapek. But he added that the ex­per­i­ment would pro­vide “very in­ter­est­ing” in­for­ma­tion on con­sumers’ will­ing­ness to shell out US$30 for a new stream­ing ti­tle. If suc­cess­ful, the price would help to “re­cap­ture some of that in­vest­ment” in a “fairly ex­pen­sive” movie, he said.</p>
    <p>Mu­lan cost an es­ti­mated US$200 mil­lion to pro­duce. It was orig­i­nally due for re­lease in March – Dis­ney even held its red-car­pet world premiere in Hol­ly­wood – be­fore be­ing de­layed mul­ti­ple times.</p>
    <p>It was one of a hand­ful of ma­jor tent­pole Hol­ly­wood re­leases ex­pected to help drive wary con­sumers back to movie the­atres.</p>
    <p>Tenet, di­rec­tor Christo­pher Nolan’s sci-fi epic, will re­lease in­ter­na­tion­ally on Aug 26 be­fore hit­ting a lim­ited num­ber of US screens next month, Warner Bros said last week.</p>
