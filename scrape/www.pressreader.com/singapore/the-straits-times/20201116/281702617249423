    <p>In­dia con­tin­ues to have mis­giv­ings over the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) and these have only hard­ened due to the Covid-19 cri­sis, said a se­nior of­fi­cial from the Min­istry of Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>In­dia an­nounced its de­ci­sion to opt out of the multi-coun­try trade agree­ment at the RCEP sum­mit in November last year.</p>
    <p>The think­ing in New Delhi over the pact has not changed, even as RCEP coun­tries, in a min­is­te­rial dec­la­ra­tion on In­dia’s par­tic­i­pa­tion last Wed­nes­day, said the agree­ment is open for In­dia to join and restart ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>This was re­it­er­ated by 15 RCEP lead­ers yes­ter­day in their joint state­ment: “We would highly value In­dia’s role in RCEP and re­it­er­ate that the RCEP re­mains open to In­dia. As one of the 16 orig­i­nal par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries, In­dia’s ac­ces­sion to the RCEP agree­ment would be wel­come in view of its par­tic­i­pa­tion in RCEP ne­go­ti­a­tions since 2012 and its strate­gic im­por­tance as a re­gional part­ner in cre­at­ing deeper and ex­panded re­gional value chains.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ashok Ma­lik, pol­icy ad­viser in In­dia’s Min­istry of Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs, said: “In­dia’s en­gage­ment with Asean coun­tries... will con­tinue, we saw it with the In­dia-Asean sum­mit (last Thurs­day). But in the case of RCEP, in its given form, it was felt that it was not ben­e­fi­cial to the In­dian econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “Mis­giv­ings, es­pe­cially about over-de­pen­dence on cer­tain coun­tries’ sup­plies and im­ports, and about very lib­eral coun­tryof-ori­gin rules, would make this a very dif­fi­cult agree­ment. Some of those mis­giv­ings have hard­ened after the pandemic-caused dis­rup­tion.”</p>
    <p>The en­gage­ment be­tween In­dia and Asean has been grow­ing in im­por­tance in re­cent times. Most Asean coun­tries have been keen to cul­ti­vate closer ties with In­dia, push­ing for greater eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion and, in some cases, se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion as well.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s de­ci­sion to exit RCEP ne­go­ti­a­tions was a po­lit­i­cal call taken at the high­est level, amid do­mes­tic op­po­si­tion from trad­ing groups.</p>
    <p>Trade deficits that In­dia faces with 12 of the 15 RCEP part­ners, a re­fusal to con­sider the ser­vice sec­tor – which in­cludes move­ment of work­ers and pro­fes­sion­als – in the pact, and con­cerns over rules of ori­gin were all fac­tors in the exit, In­dian fed­eral min­is­ter Piyush Goyal told Par­lia­ment last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>In­dia has been wary of open­ing its mar­kets to China. In­dia’s trade deficit with China was US$48.66 bil­lion (S$65.6 bil­lion) in 2019-2020. And there were bor­der skir­mishes this year, lead­ing to a back­lash against Chi­nese prod­ucts in In­dia.</p>
    <p>The ap­proach, Mr Ma­lik said, was to look at other ways for In­dian com­pa­nies to join the global chain. The Cab­i­net has ap­proved pro­duc­tion-linked in­cen­tives of 1.45 tril­lion ru­pees (S$26.2 bil­lion) for man­u­fac­tur­ers in 10 sec­tors, in­clud­ing cars, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and food prod­ucts. Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi has urged self-re­liance.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Ma­lik: “I think that route is be­ing pre­ferred and seen in the im­me­di­ate fu­ture as vi­able to build In­dia’s strengths, pend­ing a re­newed thrust and en­try into wider trade treaties in the medium to long term. But the im­me­di­ate fo­cus is on build­ing the na­tional econ­omy, as in­deed the Asian tigers did in an ear­lier era. All this makes RCEP dif­fi­cult in the near fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts be­lieve In­dia would need to take a more lib­eral view of mul­ti­lat­eral trade agree­ments if it does not want to be left be­hind.</p>
    <p>“We would have to bal­ance with the larger is­sues there be­fore us in terms of sup­ply chain con­straints. Al­most 38 per cent of our im­ports are ac­tu­ally cru­cial in­puts for our ex­ports. So we would have to con­tinue to ex­plore these global link­ages,” said Dr Sachin Chaturvedi of New Delhi-based think-tank Re­search and In­for­ma­tion Sys­tem for De­vel­op­ing Coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Many Aus­tralians have been leav­ing ma­jor cities to live in re­gional ar­eas since the Covid-19 pandemic, which has led them to re­alise they can work from home and do not need to en­dure ex­or­bi­tant prop­erty prices and heavy con­ges­tion.</p>
    <p>The ex­o­dus has left Sydney and Mel­bourne ex­pe­ri­enc­ing net losses of 14,000 peo­ple and 10,000 peo­ple, re­spec­tively, in the first half of the year. Most of the peo­ple who left went to re­gional and ru­ral ar­eas around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­la­tion shift marks a re­ver­sal of the stan­dard trend in Aus­tralia, which has typ­i­cally in­volved peo­ple mov­ing to the cities from re­gional ar­eas, where av­er­age wages are lower and where some ar­eas have much higher un­em­ploy­ment. Al­most 70 per cent of Aus­tralia’s pop­u­la­tion of 25.6 mil­lion res­i­dents live in the eight cap­i­tal cities. More than 40 per cent live in Sydney and Mel­bourne, the two largest cities.</p>
    <p>The flight from ur­ban ar­eas has had a dra­matic im­pact on the prop­erty mar­ket, caus­ing price rises in re­gional ar­eas as city prices fall. Since the pandemic hit Aus­tralia in March, prop­erty prices in cities have fallen by 2.3 per cent, while re­gional val­ues rose by 1.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty prices in some re­gional ar­eas are boom­ing. In the South­ern Grampians, a pic­turesque re­gion about 300km west of Mel­bourne in the state of Vic­to­ria, house prices rose 31 per cent in the year to Sept 30.</p>
    <p>A prop­erty agent in the South­ern Grampians, Mr John Law­son, said the de­mand for lo­cal prop­er­ties was “ab­so­lutely crazy”.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never seen any­thing like this in 48 years in real es­tate,” he told the Do­main prop­erty web­site.</p>
    <p>“We’ve had peo­ple from Mel­bourne, Queens­land, other re­gional cen­tres and even West­ern Aus­tralia buy­ing houses and blocks of land sight un­seen. They all just want to get out.”</p>
    <p>Some re­gional ar­eas had al­ready be­gun to grow be­fore the pandemic, mainly due to peo­ple leav­ing the cities, where prop­erty prices have soared in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>In the cap­i­tal cities, the me­dian prop­erty price is A$638,264 (S$625,256), against A$403,181 in re­gional ar­eas, ac­cord­ing to prop­erty an­a­lysts Core-Logic. The me­dian prices in Sydney and Mel­bourne are A$860,955 and A$666,240, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Ms Jo Yates, who left Sydney in New South Wales for the town of Te­wantin in Queens­land state, had ex­pected the move to be tem­po­rary, but is now plan­ning to stay.</p>
    <p>“Just com­ing up here, and hav­ing a bit of space, ac­tu­ally made me re­alise how on top of each other we were, how stressed every­body was, how un­friendly it can be,” she told The Sun Her­ald. “For half the money I was pay­ing in Bondi (in Sydney), I’ve got a four-bed­room house in­stead of a two-bed­room unit,” the 41-year-old added.</p>
    <p>But it is not yet clear whether the ex­o­dus will be per­ma­nent or whether Aus­tralians will re­turn to their ur­ban lives when the pandemic ends.</p>
    <p>Ur­ban plan­ning ex­pert Tony Matthews from Griffith Univer­sity said Aus­tralia ap­peared to be en­ter­ing a new era of “re­gion­al­ism”, in which res­i­dents would fan out from the cap­i­tal cities to larger re­gional cen­tres. The in­flux in re­gional ar­eas would boost eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and help lo­cal busi­nesses, he said.</p>
    <p>“The move out of cities is on; we’re not go­ing back­ward from this,” Dr Matthews told the news.com.au web­site.</p>
    <p>“The big prob­lem for re­gional cities was that they didn’t have the jobs for pro­fes­sional work­ers. But the rev­o­lu­tion in work from home has in­ad­ver­tently solved that prob­lem as your job can now move with you,” he pointed out.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne ex­pe­ri­enced a se­ri­ous sec­ond wave of the coro­n­avirus but is emerg­ing from its lock­down. The state of Vic­to­ria yes­ter­day recorded its 16th con­sec­u­tive day of no new cases and no deaths.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has recorded a to­tal of 27,711 cases and 907 deaths.</p>
    <p>A de­mog­ra­pher at the Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity, Dr Liz Allen, said the re­cent ex­o­dus had up­ended the trend of peo­ple mov­ing into larger cities, but she did not think it would be a long-term change. “Once there is a so­lu­tion to Covid-19, then peo­ple will start re­turn­ing to the cities but whether they are the same peo­ple as those that left is an­other story,” she told The Age news­pa­per.</p>
