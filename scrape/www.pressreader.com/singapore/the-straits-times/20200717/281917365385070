    <p>PARIS • If ev­ery­one alive con­sumed steaks and dairy the way Brazil­ians and Amer­i­cans do, we would need an ex­tra five plan­ets to feed the world, ac­cord­ing to the first re­port to com­pare the car­bon emis­sions from food con­sump­tion i n the Group of 20 (G-20) na­tions, re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Of the world’s big economies, only the per-capita car­bon “food­prints” in In­dia and In­done­sia are low enough to help meet the Paris cli­mate tar­get of cap­ping global warm­ing at 1.5 deg C, ac­cord­ing to the Diet for a Bet­ter Fu­ture re­port.</p>
    <p>It said that in China, where sus­tained eco­nomic growth has boosted con­sump­tion of meat and im­ported food, the av­er­age diet – on a plan­e­tary scale – would ex­ceed the 1.5 deg C thresh­old by nearly twofold.</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­tion of food for 7.7 bil­lion peo­ple is re­spon­si­ble for a quar­ter of the global car­bon emis­sions that drive cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>About 40 per cent of that comes from live­stock pro­duc­tion and food waste, with the rest gen­er­ated by rice pro­duc­tion, fer­tiliser use, land con­ver­sion and de­for­esta­tion to ac­com­mo­date com­mer­cial crops.</p>
    <p>“Cur­rently, in­di­vid­u­als in a hand­ful of coun­tries are eat­ing way too much of the wrong foods at the ex­pense of the rest of the world,” Dr Brent Lo­ken, global food lead at World Wildlife Fund and lead au­thor of the re­port, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>These im­bal­anced di­ets of a rel­a­tive hand­ful of rich coun­tries are “to the detri­ment of cli­mate, health and economies”, he said.</p>
    <p>The re­port by EAT – an Os­lobased non-profit group that has led peer-re­viewed re­search on the nexus of diet, health and cli­mate change – also rated G-20 na­tional di­etary guide­lines, pro­ject­ing the car­bon foot­print they would pro­duce if fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, this rank­ing roughly mir­rors ac­tual con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina tops the list with a diet ex­ceed­ing cli­mate thresh­olds by nearly five­fold, fol­lowed by Canada, Brazil, the United States, Rus­sia and Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the spec­trum, the coun­tries with the most cli­mate-friendly di­etary guide­lines are In­done­sia, In­dia, South Korea, China and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>“This re­port makes it pos­si­ble for the first time to com­pare and track the car­bon emis­sions baked into each coun­try’s na­tional guide­lines,” said Pro­fes­sor Co­rina Hawkes, di­rec­tor of the Univer­sity of Lon­don’s Cen­tre for Food Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>How the world sources food also has an im­pact on dis­ease, in­clud­ing viral out­breaks such as the coro­n­avirus, the au­thors said.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent pan­demic has high­lighted just how bro­ken our food sys­tem is,” said Dr Lo­ken.</p>
    <p>“The food that we eat and how we pro­duce it are also key driv­ers in the emer­gence of deadly viruses such as the one that leads to Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>De­for­esta­tion in par­tic­u­lar erases the bound­ary be­tween hu­man set­tle­ments and nat­u­ral reser­voirs of dis­ease in wild an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem of waste is con­cen­trated in wealthy na­tions, Dr Lo­ken said, adding: “It’s an is­sue mainly be­cause rich peo­ple throw away too much food.”</p>
    <p>The re­port also ar­gues that there are sweep­ing ben­e­fits – both for health and economies – to shift­ing to­wards health­ier di­ets rich in legumes, veg­eta­bles, fruit and nuts, and light on dairy and meats, es­pe­cially beef and lamb.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier re­search has cal­cu­lated that an over­haul of the global food sys­tem could un­leash tril­lions of dol­lars each year in new busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties, and save even more in terms of re­duced dam­age to peo­ple’s health and the planet.</p>
    <p>HARM DONE</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, in­di­vid­u­als in a hand­ful of coun­tries are eat­ing way too much of the wrong foods at the ex­pense of the rest of the world.</p>
