    <p>Usu­ally, I sub­scribe to the “go big or go home” school of thought. I like my flavours big, my por­tions huge, my am­bi­tions out­sized.</p>
    <p>Not for me the del­i­cate, the frag­ile, the sub­tle. Yawn. Please go home and stay there.</p>
    <p>Then, I chance upon the small­est, most del­i­cate sand­wich cook­ies, from a home-based food busi­ness called Just Julia Homebakes. I make an un­char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally small or­der. I have or­dered enough things to know not ev­ery heir­loom recipe out there is a good one. I look at the pretty Vi­en­nese Whirl cook­ies and feel con­fi­dent I can eat all 10 at once.</p>
    <p>They are about the size of a lit­tle gem bis­cuit.</p>
    <p>But I have one first, and now I know why they’re so tiny. It’s to make you want more.</p>
    <p>Ms Julia Tan, 31, whose busi­ness this is, started it in May 2016, tweak­ing her grand­mother’s cookie recipes. Her Cof­fee & Specu­loos Vi­en­nese Whirls (from $5 for 10, right) are the bomb. The cof­fee flavour is in­tense and this is re­mark­able, con­sid­er­ing she does not use cof­fee ex­tract to flavour them.</p>
    <p>The but­tery lit­tle cook­ies are sand­wiched with Specu­loos but­ter, which I can do with­out, but it does make each one a very ex­cel­lent tea time treat.</p>
    <p>Tof­feenut Vi­en­nese Swirls (from $5 for seven) has the nuts sus­pended in caramel right smack in the mid­dle of a but­ter cookie swirl. I mar­vel at the pa­tience it must take to make these treats.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan also of­fers chunky cook­ies, brown­ies and cakes.</p>
    <p>Did some­one say chunky?</p>
    <p>But I have fallen in love with tiny. Who would have thought?</p>
