    <p>The Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases (NCID) has tem­po­rar­ily stopped en­rolling Covid-19 pa­tients for a mon­o­clonal an­ti­body trial af­ter the Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany that de­vel­oped the drug had to halt the trial last week due to safety con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Singapore is only the third coun­try to be in­volved in the trial af­ter the United States and Den­mark, and this is the na­tion’s first phase three mon­o­clonal an­ti­body trial.</p>
    <p>The NCID an­nounced that it was ready to en­rol its first pa­tients in the trial as of Oct 6, and a week later, on Oct 13, the pharma com­pany, Eli Lilly, said it had to pause the late-stage trial, called Ac­tiv-3.</p>
    <p>The drug­maker did not dis­close de­tails about what the safety con­cern was or how many people were af­fected.</p>
    <p>“Fol­low­ing in­struc­tions from the Ac­tive-3 safety mon­i­tor­ing board, the NCID im­me­di­ately paused screen­ing and en­rol­ment of new Covid-19 pa­tients for the trial,” the NCID told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The halt does not af­fect the treat­ment of pa­tients who have al­ready been en­rolled in the trial.</p>
    <p>So far, one pa­tient in Singapore has joined the study and is well, with no ad­verse ef­fects re­lated to the drugs in­volved in the study, said the NCID.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre added that the safety mon­i­tor­ing board is re­view­ing the study’s data fur­ther and will ad­vise in the next few weeks whether it is safe to con­tinue with the trial.</p>
    <p>“Rig­or­ous mon­i­tor­ing of pa­tient safety is a crit­i­cal com­po­nent in the de­vel­op­ment of new treat­ments. It is not un­usual that any clin­i­cal trial may be tem­po­rar­ily paused to re­view data in more de­tail if any pos­si­ble con­cerns are raised,” the cen­tre added.</p>
    <p>The NCID pre­vi­ously said that it aims to en­rol 100 lo­cal pa­tients in the study.</p>
    <p>Ac­tive-3’s mon­o­clonal an­ti­body is a pu­ri­fied, highly ac­tive an­ti­body that tar­gets the spike pro­tein of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>On Oct 8, the NCID said it will en­rol Covid-19 pa­tients with pneu­mo­nia or high-risk pa­tients older than 45 with chronic health prob­lems such as di­a­betes or high blood pres­sure.</p>
    <p>The pa­tients will get ei­ther the an­ti­body or a placebo, and all will be given the an­tivi­ral drug remde­sivir.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients may also be given the steroid dex­am­etha­sone, a drug which broadly sup­presses the body’s im­mune re­sponse and can be used to treat se­vere asthma and se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­tive-3 was not the only Covid-19-re­lated trial to be sus­pended last week.</p>
    <p>John­son & John­son had to pause ad­vanced tri­als for a po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine af­ter a vol­un­teer fell ill.</p>
