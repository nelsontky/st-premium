    <p>Chelsea man­ager Frank Lam­pard hailed Kai Havertz’s hat­trick per­for­mance i n their 6-0 League Cup win over Barns­ley as the first of many great nights to come from the Ger­many for­ward.</p>
    <p>The club’s most ex­pen­sive sum­mer sign­ing strug­gled in Premier League games against Brighton and Liver­pool, but showed on Wed­nes­day why Chelsea spent £71 mil­lion (S$124.5 mil­lion) to get him from Bun­desliga out­fit Bayer Lev­erkusen.</p>
    <p>His first se­nior tre­ble came from four shots – all on tar­get, with no player reg­is­ter­ing more ef­forts. Havertz also made more tack­les (five) than any other player.</p>
    <p>“I said in the last two games that</p>
    <p>Kai has had no pre-sea­son and in sign­ing for the club, I think it took a few days out as well,” Lam­pard told re­porters af­ter Chelsea booked their place in the fourth round, where they will face Tot­ten­ham or Ley­ton Ori­ent.</p>
    <p>“The com­bi­na­tions he had with Tammy Abra­ham, the way he grew into the game and had con­fi­dence and the three goals.</p>
    <p>“It was a great night for Kai and the first of many for him.”</p>
    <p>Havertz is al­ready look­ing for­ward to fac­ing West Bromwich Al­bion in the Premier League tomorrow.</p>
    <p>“I think that step by step, I will be fit­ter and this match was very good for me, to get more con­fi­dence,” said the 21-year-old, who com­pleted his hat-trick against the Cham­pi­onship side inside 65 min­utes when he nut­megged the goal­keeper and stroked the ball home.</p>
    <p>“I hope to con­tinue on Satur­day like that.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low new boys Thi­ago Silva and Ben Chilwell made their Chelsea de­buts against the sec­ond-tier English team, while Abra­ham and Ross Barkley made the most of rare starts to get their names on the score­sheet, with Olivier Giroud com­plet­ing the scor­ing.</p>
    <p>Chelsea yes­ter­day took their sum­mer spend­ing to £250 mil­lion with the sign­ing of goal­keeper Edouard Mendy from Rennes on a five-year deal for a re­ported fee of £22 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Sene­gal stop­per kept nine clean sheets in 24 Ligue 1 ap­pear­ances last sea­son.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old was one of the</p>
    <p>ACCLIMATIS­ING TO ENGLISH GAME</p>
    <p>I think that step by step, I will be fit­ter and this match was very good for me, to get more con­fi­dence. I hope to con­tinue on Satur­day like that.</p>
    <p>KAI HAVERTZ , Chelsea and Ger­many for­ward be­lieves he is set­tling into life at Stam­ford Bridge af­ter his block­buster sum­mer move and has West Bromwich Al­bion next in his sights.</p>
    <p>main rea­sons why Rennes se­cured Cham­pi­ons League qual­i­fi­ca­tion for the first time in the club’s his­tory, sav­ing 76.3 per cent of shots he faced.</p>
    <p>He will com­pete for a start­ing spot with Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga, who has strug­gled for form and con­fi­dence at Stam­ford Bridge, and could start against the Baggies.</p>
    <p>Arse­nal won the only all-Premier League tie on Wed­nes­day as they beat Le­ices­ter 2-0.</p>
    <p>Chris­tian Fuchs’ own goal broke the dead­lock at the King Power Sta­dium and Ed­die Nke­tiah added a late sec­ond for the Gun­ners, who could face Liver­pool at An­field twice i n three days next week should the Premier League cham­pi­ons progress past Lin­coln this morn­ing (Sin­ga­pore time).</p>
    <p>Ever­ton con­tin­ued their fine start to the sea­son with a 5-2 win at League One side Fleet­wood de­spite two howlers from Eng­land No. 1 Jor­dan Pick­ford, while New­cas­tle recorded their big­gest away win, ham­mer­ing third-tier More­cambe 7-0.</p>
