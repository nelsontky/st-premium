    <p>MEL­BOURNE • Aus­tralia’s sec­ond­biggest city will this week exit its coron­avirus lock­down fol­low­ing nearly four months un­der oner­ous re­stric­tions, af­ter no new daily cases or deaths were recorded.</p>
    <p>Stay-at-home or­ders for Mel­bourne’s five mil­lion res­i­dents will be lifted from mid­night to­day, while restau­rants, beauty sa­lons and re­tail stores will be per­mit­ted to throw open their doors.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne and the rest of Vic­to­ria state recorded the first 24-hour pe­riod with­out any new Covid-19 cases since June 8 – be­fore se­cu­rity bun­gles at quar­an­tine ho­tels for re­turned in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers sparked a ma­jor out­break in July.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the much-an­tic­i­pated eas­ing of re­stric­tions yes­ter­day, Vic­to­ria’s Premier Daniel An­drews’ voice cracked as he de­clared it an “emo­tional day”.</p>
    <p>“This has been a very dif­fi­cult year. And Vic­to­ri­ans have given a lot and I’m proud of ev­ery sin­gle one of them,” he said in the state cap­i­tal. Asked if ale-lov­ing Vic­to­ri­ans could now “get on the beers”, Mr An­drews said he “might go a lit­tle higher up the shelf”.</p>
    <p>Ju­bi­lant so­cial me­dia users de­clared the re­turn to zero cases and deaths “Donut Day”, with the hash­tag trend­ing as Twit­ter users posted self­ies with the sweet treats.</p>
    <p>In the sum­mer, Mel­bourne be­came the epi­cen­tre of the coun­try’s sec­ond coron­avirus wave, with new daily cases ris­ing above 700 in Au­gust, when the rest of Aus­tralia was al­ready rolling back re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Some curbs were al­ready lifted last week, al­low­ing hair­cuts and golf games to re­turn, but fur­ther eas­ing planned for Sun­day was de­layed by 24 hours to as­sess thou­sands of test re­sults af­ter a small out­break in the city’s north.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews said all the tests had re­turned neg­a­tive. “It was worth wait­ing to be ab­so­lutely con­fi­dent to be sure that our team had their arms around those pos­i­tive cases and fun­da­men­tal con­trol of the out­break – and that is ex­actly what these num­bers show us,” he said.</p>
    <p>Pres­sure had been mount­ing for weeks on of­fi­cials to al­low the city more free­doms, with a litany of rules re­main­ing as they took a cau­tious ap­proach to re­open­ing de­spite the fall­ing num­ber of cases.</p>
    <p>The rest of Vic­to­ria state is al­ready en­joy­ing fewer curbs, with gyms set to re­open and out­door live mu­sic to re­sume from to­day.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions on travel be­tween Mel­bourne and re­gional Vic­to­ria will be lifted from Nov 8, with a 25km travel ra­dius for city res­i­dents also set to be re­moved the same day. But the state re­mains cut off from the rest of Aus­tralia, where the re­gional au­thor­i­ties have largely taken a hy­per-vig­i­lant re­sponse to Covid-19 such as main­tain­ing in­ter­nal bor­der re­stric­tions.</p>
