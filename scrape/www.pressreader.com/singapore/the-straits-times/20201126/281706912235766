    <p>In­done­sia’s Mar­itime Af­fairs and Fish­eries Min­is­ter Edhy Prabowo has been ar­rested for al­leged cor­rup­tion re­lated to his min­istry’s de­ci­sion to lift a ban on lob­ster lar­vae ex­ports.</p>
    <p>Mr Edhy was ar­rested along with more than a dozen oth­ers early yes­ter­day at the coun­try’s main Soekarno-Hatta In­ter­na­tional Air­port in Jakarta, the Cor­rup­tion Erad­i­ca­tion Com­mis­sion’s (KPK) act­ing spokesman Ali Fikri said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Among the 17 de­tained are the Mar­itime Af­fairs and Fish­eries Min­is­ter and his wife, sev­eral min­istry of­fi­cials and peo­ple from pri­vate com­pa­nies,” Mr Ali said, adding that KPK will in­ter­ro­gate the de­tainees for 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing news of the ar­rest, Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo re­leased a state­ment say­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>“I trust KPK as it works in a trans­par­ent, open and pro­fes­sional man­ner. The gov­ern­ment is con­sis­tent in sup­port­ing ef­forts to pre­vent and erad­i­cate cor­rup­tion.”</p>
    <p>News web­site Tempo.co had re­ported the ar­rest. It said Mr Edhy was rounded up at 1.23am as he ar­rived from a trip to the United States. The re­port was later con­firmed by KPK com­mis­sioner Nawawi Po­molango.</p>
    <p>KPK deputy com­mis­sioner Nu­rul Ghufron told Kom­pas.com the agency was in­volved in the ar­rests.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­lated to the ex­port of lob­ster lar­vae,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Edhy was added to the list of In­done­sian min­is­ters and other high-pro­file fig­ures de­tained by KPK in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust 2018, then So­cial Af­fairs Min­is­ter Idrus Marham was ar­rested by KPK for re­ceiv­ing bribes from a busi­ness­man. It was in ex­change for his sup­port for a power plant project in the Riau prov­ince.</p>
    <p>The for­mer min­is­ter was con­victed last year by a district court and given three years’ jail be­fore the Supreme Court cut his sen­tence to two years.</p>
    <p>In 2017, KPK nabbed and threw in jail for 15 years then Speaker of Par­lia­ment Setya No­vanto for si­phon­ing off funds from a na­tional iden­tity card pro­cure­ment project.</p>
    <p>KPK had also ar­rested rogue state prose­cu­tors and ac­tive po­lice gen­er­als.</p>
    <p>Mr Edhy had in De­cem­ber last year re­versed a pol­icy in­tro­duced by his pre­de­ces­sor, Mr Susi Pud­ji­as­tuti, who placed a ban on the ex­port of lob­ster lar­vae in 2016, cit­ing con­ser­va­tion and eco­nomic rea­sons.</p>
    <p>At a hear­ing in Par­lia­ment to re­verse the pol­icy, Mr Edhy told MPs that do­ing so would ben­e­fit fish­er­men and the state cof­fers.</p>
    <p>He also ar­gued that the lift­ing of the ban would not af­fect the ma­ture lob­ster pop­u­la­tion, point­ing out a re­search re­port which re­vealed that less than 1 per cent of lob­ster lar­vae reach ma­tu­rity in their nat­u­ral habi­tat.</p>
    <p>Mr Charles Meikyansah, a mem­ber of the par­lia­men­tary com­mit­tee over­see­ing environmen­t and mar­itime af­fairs, told Jakartabas­ed El­sh­inta ra­dio yes­ter­day that the com­mit­tee was split on the de­ci­sion to lift the ban.</p>
    <p>But they even­tu­ally sup­ported the min­is­ter’s mo­tion, on con­di­tion that his min­istry up­holds sus­tain­abil­ity and main­tains trans­parency when se­lect­ing com­pa­nies to ex­port lob­ster lar­vae.</p>
    <p>It later emerged that among the com­pa­nies granted per­mis­sion, one was linked to politi­cians with Gerindra, the po­lit­i­cal party Mr Edhy hails from.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter de­nied he was aware of this, in­sist­ing he was not di­rectly in­volved in any op­er­a­tional de­ci­sion to grant com­pa­nies per­mis­sion to ex­port. He said a team, com­pris­ing se­nior bu­reau­crats in the min­istry, had made the de­ci­sion.</p>
