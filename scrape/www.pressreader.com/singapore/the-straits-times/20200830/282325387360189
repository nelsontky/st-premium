    <p>When life throws us a curve, we have lit­tle choice but to fo­cus, an­tic­i­pate the up­com­ing ob­sta­cles, then run like wild­fire. In base­ball jargon, we long for a home run, while in life, we sim­ply want to fix what is bro­ken in our mix.</p>
    <p>My family’s most re­cent curve ball be­gan dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker when, like many oth­ers bound to the home, we fo­cused in­wards. Re­turn­ing to the kitchen, I pre­pared healthy meals for my family and we all, in­clud­ing Happy, 17, and Bee, 12, ex­er­cised daily. As a re­sult, and cou­pled with no travel, my hus­band Jim lost 10kg.</p>
    <p>When he went for his phys­i­cal, we all an­tic­i­pated a pos­i­tive, reaf­firm­ing health re­port.</p>
    <p>Al­though he is 77 years old, ini­tial tests showed his weight was the same as it was in his late 30s, and he was just as fast on the tread­mill as he was 40 years ago.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his ex­er­cise stress test, which mir­rors how the heart works, dis­played an “ano­maly” in his heart. While a nurse as­sured Jim this was likely noth­ing, a CT scan a few days later in­di­cated oth­er­wise. The ano­maly meant he had to un­dergo a coro­nary an­giogram.</p>
    <p>Once I en­tered the op­er­at­ing the­atre post-an­giogram, with my hus­band som­bre, surely con­tem­plat­ing his fate, car­di­ol­o­gist Dr Stan­ley Chia showed me a video of Jim’s block­age – 80 per cent in the main artery, as well as high block­age in an­other two spots. There was no deny­ing this.</p>
    <p>Our ini­tial eupho­ria over Jim’s ex­cel­lent health turned to one of dis­be­lief. How could he feel so good, ex­er­cis­ing daily, eat­ing well, with nary a symp­tom, while liv­ing with block­age that could re­sult in a heart at­tack or stroke? Even death was a pos­si­bil­ity, if ei­ther the heart mus­cle or brain were to be starved of blood flow for too long.</p>
    <p>Over the next cou­ple of days, we con­tem­plated how to pro­ceed: if tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine might of­fer a so­lu­tion, if there was any other op­tion be­yond by­pass surgery. Once we knew the re­al­ity of the block­age, and the tragic pos­si­bil­i­ties for his fu­ture, all of us, es­pe­cially Jim, were ready to ar­range the pro­ce­dure pronto.</p>
    <p>Once the by­pass op­er­a­tion was sched­uled for four days away, lin­ger­ing ques­tions con­tin­ued to jockey for space in my para­noid head: What if he had not gone for the phys­i­cal? How long would he live with­out the by­pass surgery? Were we mak­ing the right de­ci­sion since there is a risk, from 1 to 3 per cent, of death dur­ing the op­er­a­tion? Would health in­surance cover all of this ex­ten­sive surgery and hos­pi­tal stay?</p>
    <p>Ob­vi­ously, how Jim felt is what re­ally mat­tered, but as his wife of 20 years, I felt an im­mense weight of the un­known. He could not die. Happy and Bee both needed him. Jim was my pil­lar: How to cope if I were to lose him? Un­able to dis­cuss the or­deal with­out tear­ing up, I re­mained out­wardly strong for Jim and our daugh­ters, while alone, I mor­phed into an un­cer­tain, anx­ious ghost of my­self.</p>
    <p>Shar­ing the de­tails with my clos­est friends, I ap­pre­ci­ated the of­fers of sup­port and help, but there was lit­tle they could do.</p>
    <p>While deal­ing with the un­cer­tainty, I sought soli­tude. On the eve of the surgery, our labradoo­dle Bella, who sleeps with Happy, re­fused to leave Jim’s and my bed­room. She knew.</p>
    <p>On the dreaded morn­ing, at 9.25am, two nurses paused be­fore rolling Jim’s stretcher into the op­er­at­ing area. As re­quired with the present pan­demic, I wore a mask and Jim’s kiss did not touch the skin of my cheek. Sec­onds later, af­ter a fi­nal squeeze of my hand, he was wheeled away. I in­stantly won­dered if that in­com­plete kiss would ever be a re­gret.</p>
    <p>In the end, the triple by­pass surgery went like clock­work. His car­dio­tho­racic sur­geon, Dr Lim Chong Hee, opened Jim’s chest cav­ity and grafted a new artery from his leg onto the heart, as a heart-lung ma­chine kept his or­gans func­tion­ing. The op­er­a­tion, less than three hours long, suc­ceeded in al­low­ing blood to flow around the block­ages.</p>
    <p>“Jim was a su­per­star. He’s al­ready breath­ing on his own. Visit him in a few hours,” Dr Lim shared, when we fi­nally spoke in the early af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>In­stead, I rushed to visit Jim. Groggy, sal­low, ashen and frail, he looked dread­ful – an im­age I still can­not erase.</p>
    <p>“He just had open-heart surgery!” my mother barked over the phone when I re­counted this.</p>
    <p>When Jim saw me, his voice faint and words slow, since the breath­ing tube had just been re­moved, he said, with a crooked smile: “Tell Bee she must do her oral ex­ams.”</p>
    <p>At din­ner the night be­fore, he had shared lively ban­ter with Bee, who de­creed: “If the surgery doesn’t go well, I will not have to do English and Chi­nese orals!”</p>
    <p>Nat­u­rally, I laughed some­thing silly, grate­ful for the suc­cess­ful surgery, and for Jim dis­play­ing a wee bit of his trade­mark wit so soon in the af­ter­math.</p>
    <p>By the next morn­ing, he looked more him­self, while com­plain­ing of the loud night he had en­dured in the ICU. His sur­geon Dr Lim, at­ten­tive, with plenty of re­as­sur­ing What­sApp up­dates over the seven-day hos­pi­tal or­deal, and I shared a ner­vous laugh to­gether as Jim was moved to the gen­eral ward.</p>
    <p>“They don’t know what’s com­ing at them,” Dr Lim whis­pered, with a chuckle.</p>
    <p>All of this drama taught me that be­yond my hus­band, in Sin­ga­pore, heart dis­ease and stroke are se­ri­ous con­cerns. Seven­teen peo­ple die from these ev­ery sin­gle day, ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Heart Foun­da­tion, ac­count­ing for 29.2 per cent of all deaths last year. That means al­most one in three die from heart dis­ease or stroke.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, glob­ally, car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­eases are the top cause of death, killing al­most 18 mil­lion an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>More men die sud­denly from heart at­tacks than women, and half of men who die of heart at­tacks have no symp­toms at all. In­ter­est­ingly, heart dis­ease kills about six times more women than breast can­cer does, while fe­males are more prone to ex­pe­ri­ence symp­toms of heart dis­ease like short­ness of breath, jaw pain, back pain, nau­sea and light-head­ed­ness ver­sus the “clas­sic” chest-pres­sure warn­ing sign.</p>
    <p>Too of­ten, both males and fe­males blame hard work or our stress­ful lives for caus­ing the symp­toms, not equat­ing the pain to our over­worked hearts. Thus, we fail to men­tion it to our doc­tors.</p>
    <p>I have also learnt we can have a heart at­tack with­out even know­ing it. Silent heart at­tacks, or silent my­ocar­dial in­farc­tions, lack the in­tense symp­toms – chest pain and pres­sure, ex­treme pain in the arm, neck or jaw, sweat­ing or short­ness of breath – of a “real” heart at­tack.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Har­vard Med­i­cal School, 45 per cent of heart at­tacks are silent, found sub­se­quently by an elec­tro­car­dio­gram. Scar­ring from a silent heart at­tack can trig­ger ab­nor­mal heart rhythms, an­other heart at­tack and even death dur­ing ex­er­cise. Some say what we do not know can­not hurt us, but that is ob­vi­ously not the case here.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing obe­sity, high blood pres­sure and high choles­terol in check plays a big part in keep­ing all of us heart-healthy. From 2010 to 2017, high blood pres­sure and high blood choles­terol rose from 14 per cent to 33 per cent among res­i­dents aged 18 to 69 lo­cally. With our pop­u­la­tion age­ing rapidly, this dan­ger­ous num­ber will only in­crease.</p>
    <p>Con­trol­ling the risks, through good di­ets, ex­er­cise and not smok­ing, does not mean we are above the fray, but if these are not well reg­u­lated, then the risks only climb higher. We are ask­ing for a curve ball, or maybe worse.</p>
    <p>I share this very per­sonal story to en­cour­age read­ers with a symp­tom per­haps con­nected to heart dis­ease, or for those who have not had a check-up in for­ever, to please visit a doc­tor. Even if we think we are fit, as Jim did, the Min­istry of Health’s en­hanced sub­si­dies for Screen for Life should en­cour­age more to go for reg­u­lar health screen­ings at Com­mu­nity Health As­sist Scheme gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clin­ics.</p>
    <p>To­day, six weeks post-surgery, Jim is back in his groove, ex­er­cis­ing, do­ing Zoom calls, eat­ing healthily and savour­ing life. As I watch over him like a hawk, it drives him batty, but with my eye on the prize, I ex­pect to have him around for a long time. Thank­fully, with the de­tec­tion of the block­age, and the re­sult­ing triple by­pass surgery, he is go­ing strong.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery sin­gle one of us needs to treat our health as a gen­uine pri­or­ity, liv­ing as we know we should, for our­selves – but also, for the sake of those who love us.</p>
