    <p>BRUS­SELS, ROME, GENEVA • Bel­gium will let shops re­open from to­mor­row, but will keep other coro­n­avirus curbs over the fes­tive pe­riod, in­clud­ing lim­its on gath­er­ings over Christ­mas and a ban on fire­works at New Year, said Bel­gian Prime Min­is­ter Alexan­der De Croo.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries across Europe have been bat­tling a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions, and wrestling with how to keep their cit­i­zens safe while al­low­ing them a lit­tle re­lief over the hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>“If we loosen too soon, the num­bers will shoot up and then it will be very dif­fi­cult,” Mr De Croo told a news con­fer­ence on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“If we have a third wave, it will be worse than the sec­ond and it will be harder to get out of it.”</p>
    <p>While Bri­tain will al­low up to three house­holds to meet at home over Christ­mas, Bel­gian house­holds will be able to be in close con­tact with only one ad­di­tional per­son. Peo­ple liv­ing on their own will be able to meet two oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Non-es­sen­tial stores will be al­lowed to re­open, but Bel­gians will have to shop alone and only spend 30 min­utes in­side.</p>
    <p>Mu­se­ums and swim­ming pools can open, but fire­works, a sta­ple of New Year cel­e­bra­tions, will be banned to limit gath­er­ings and for­eign travel is strongly dis­cour­aged. Bars, restau­rants, hair­dress­ing salons, and sports and cul­tural cen­tres re­main closed.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has claimed 16,219 lives in the coun­try of 11 mil­lion peo­ple, Europe’s high­est rate per capita of con­firmed fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Ital­ian gov­ern­ment will ease anti-Covid re­stric­tions in five re­gions from yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing in the coun­try’s rich­est and most pop­u­lous re­gion Lom­bardy, the Health Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Lom­bardy, Pied­mont and Cal­abria will be down­graded from red to or­ange zones, while Si­cily and Lig­uria will drop from the or­ange to the yel­low zone, which has the least re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Fri­day’s de­ci­sion fol­lows a grad­ual de­cline in Covid-19 hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions in much of Italy over the past week, with the num­ber of new cases also re­treat­ing from the highs seen ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Italy in­tro­duced a three-tier zon­ing sys­tem three weeks ago, with cal­i­brated curbs depend­ing on a va­ri­ety of fac­tors, in­clud­ing in­fec­tion rates and hos­pi­tal oc­cu­pancy.</p>
    <p>Red zone res­i­dents are only al­lowed to leave their homes for work, health rea­sons or emer­gen­cies, while bars, restau­rants and most shops are shut­tered.</p>
    <p>In the or­ange zone, peo­ple can move freely within their towns and cities, but can­not travel else­where. Bars and restau­rants are closed, but shops can open.</p>
    <p>Ms Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WHO) tech­ni­cal lead for Covid-19, said on Fri­day that even if coun­tries see a fall in coro­n­avirus cases, they need to stay vig­i­lant.</p>
    <p>“What we don’t want to see is sit­u­a­tions where you are mov­ing from lock­down to bring­ing (the virus) un­der con­trol to an­other lock­down,” she told a vir­tual brief­ing in Geneva.</p>
    <p>“It is in our power to keep trans­mis­sion low. We have seen dozens of coun­tries show us that it can be brought un­der con­trol and kept un­der con­trol.”</p>
    <p>The agency’s top emer­gency ex­pert said on Fri­day that it would be “highly spec­u­la­tive” for the WHO to say the coro­n­avirus did not emerge in China, where it was first iden­ti­fied in a food mar­ket in De­cem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>China is push­ing a nar­ra­tive via state me­dia that the virus ex­isted abroad be­fore it was dis­cov­ered in the cen­tral city of Wuhan, cit­ing the pres­ence of the coro­n­avirus on im­ported frozen food pack­ag­ing and sci­en­tific pa­pers claim­ing it had been cir­cu­lat­ing in Europe last year.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s highly spec­u­la­tive for us to say that the dis­ease did not emerge in China,” Dr Mike Ryan said at a vir­tual brief­ing in Geneva af­ter be­ing asked if Covid-19 could have first emerged out­side China.</p>
    <p>“It is clear from a pub­lic health per­spec­tive that you start your in­ves­ti­ga­tions where the hu­man cases first emerged,” he added, say­ing that ev­i­dence might then lead to other places.</p>
