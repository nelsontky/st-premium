    <p>When the Covid-19 pandemic be­gan spread­ing across Aus­tralia in March, state and fed­eral lead­ers over­came their tra­di­tional bick­er­ing to work closely to­gether in a rare show of na­tional sol­i­dar­ity. How­ever, that un­usual unity has ended fol­low­ing a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions in the state of Vic­to­ria that has led to fierce di­vi­sions and re­crim­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>The 119-year-old fed­er­a­tion, which in­cludes the fed­eral gov­ern­ment as well as six state and two ter­ri­tory govern­ments, is now com­ing un­der se­ri­ous strain amid ac­ri­mo­nious dis­putes be­tween the dif­fer­ent tiers of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the early months of the pandemic, Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son took the un­usual step of con­ven­ing a na­tional Cab­i­net, which in­cludes the lead­ers of the states and ter­ri­to­ries and en­abled a co­or­di­nated na­tion­wide re­sponse. The Cab­i­net has now met al­most 30 times.</p>
    <p>But the out­break in Vic­to­ria led to cracks in the con­sen­sus as states have split on whether to tighten their bor­der clo­sures. Some states banned all do­mes­tic vis­i­tors, oth­ers re­stricted vis­i­tors from Vic­to­ria or from af­fected ar­eas in New South Wales.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son, who be­longs to the Lib­eral Party, has been push­ing for a speedy end to the var­i­ous travel bans, say­ing they are oner­ous and are caus­ing fur­ther eco­nomic dam­age.</p>
    <p>But Western Aus­tralia, which is led by a La­bor gov­ern­ment, last week re­jected a plan to open in­ter­state bor­ders by the Christ­mas hol­i­day in late De­cem­ber. The state is largely free of the virus and has been eco­nom­i­cally shel­tered by strong China-fu­elled de­mand for its re­sources.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing his de­ci­sion, state Premier Mark McGowan said: “Un­like the rest of the coun­try, WA is not cur­rently in a re­ces­sion. So we won’t be pre­ma­turely re­open­ing our bor­ders.”</p>
    <p>Queens­land, which is led by a La­bor gov­ern­ment, has also come un­der in­tense pres­sure from the fed­eral gov­ern­ment to re­open its bor­der with New South Wales.</p>
    <p>Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter Peter Dut­ton ac­cused the Queens­land gov­ern­ment of keep­ing the bor­der shut to im­prove its prospects ahead of an up­com­ing elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are right to be an­gry,” Mr Dut­ton told 2GB Ra­dio on Thurs­day. “There is no health rea­son (for the clo­sure)... it’s all for po­lit­i­cal rea­sons. Un­for­tu­nately, a lot of peo­ple are suf­fer­ing and feel­ing the con­se­quences.”</p>
    <p>But the Premier of Queens­land, Ms An­nasta­cia Palaszczuk, crit­i­cised the fed­eral gov­ern­ment’s ap­proach, say­ing she “will not be bul­lied nor will I be in­tim­i­dated”.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, Aus­tralia had recorded 26,565 cases of Covid-19 and 797 deaths. Of the 55 new cases yes­ter­day, 43 were in Vic­to­ria, 10 in New South Wales and two in Queens­land. There were no new cases in all the other states and ter­ri­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the dis­pute over travel bans, the fed­eral gov­ern­ment has also crit­i­cised Vic­to­ria’s La­bor gov­ern­ment over its han­dling of the out­break.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing fed­eral Lib­eral-Na­tional coali­tion has at­tacked Vic­to­ria’s La­bor leader Daniel An­drews for fail­ures in the ho­tel quar­an­tine process which led to the out­break and for hav­ing in­ad­e­quate con­tact trac­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Trea­surer Josh Fry­den­berg has squarely blamed Mr An­drews for the costly sec­ond wave, which has led to a strin­gent lock­down and an 8pm to 5am cur­few.</p>
    <p>“This has to be the big­gest pub­lic pol­icy fail­ure by a state gov­ern­ment in liv­ing mem­ory,” Mr Fry­den­berg told re­porters re­cently.</p>
    <p>The split be­tween the fed­eral gov­ern­ment and some state govern­ments has partly been driven by po­lit­i­cal par­ti­san­ship.</p>
    <p>But vet­eran po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tor Paul Kelly ob­served that a broader prob­lem is that state govern­ments have pri­mary re­spon­si­bil­ity for front-line health ser­vices and so are keen to im­pose strin­gent lock­downs and bor­der clo­sures. In con­trast, the fed­eral gov­ern­ment is seen as hav­ing over­all re­spon­si­bil­ity for the econ­omy and un­em­ploy­ment and so is urg­ing states to wind back restric­tions and open their bor­ders.</p>
    <p>“The big trap fac­ing Mor­ri­son is that the pre­miers are be­ing judged by their ca­pac­ity to con­tain t he virus, not by t heir economies,” Mr Kelly wrote in The Aus­tralian. “Success on the med­i­cal front is achieved by lock­downs and bor­der clo­sures un­sup­ported by Mor­ri­son and at the di­rect cost of eco­nomic re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>De­spite press­ing the states to re­open their economies, Mr Mor­ri­son has con­tin­ued to push for na­tional unity. Dur­ing a re­cent dis­cus­sion of the Covid-19 cri­sis, he also ac­knowl­edged that “at times it has felt like Aus­tralia could break apart”.</p>
    <p>“The fed­er­a­tion is hard, al­ways has been,” he told re­porters. “Any­one who’s ever sat in my of­fice has al­ways known that, and we’ve all tried to find bet­ter ways to make it work and so we re­main com­mit­ted to that.”</p>
