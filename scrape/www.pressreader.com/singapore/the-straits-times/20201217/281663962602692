    <p>•</p>
    <p>HANOI A strong re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, surg­ing ex­ports and healthy pub­lic spend­ing have helped Viet­nam buck a global re­ces­sion this year and fast-track its re­cov­ery, with an­a­lysts pre­dict­ing it is likely to en­joy one of the high­est growth rates in the world.</p>
    <p>But the pain is not over for some sec­tors, with con­tain­ment mea­sures and bor­der dis­rup­tions ham­mer­ing the coun­try’s tourism in­dus­try and leav­ing the once-boom­ing avi­a­tion sec­tor limp­ing.</p>
    <p>While many coun­tries have had high in­fec­tion and mor­tal­ity rates, Viet­nam has recorded fewer than 1,500 coro­n­avirus cases and 35 deaths, thanks to mass quar­an­tines, ex­pan­sive con­tact trac­ing and strict con­trols on move­ment, al­low­ing fac­to­ries to largely stay open and peo­ple to swiftly get back to work.</p>
    <p>“The se­ri­ous lock­down lasted for less than three months, so do­mes­tic ac­tiv­ity was quickly back to nor­mal by June,” pub­lic pol­icy lec­turer Nguyen Xuan Thanh from Ful­bright Univer­sity Viet­nam told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>While many Western coun­tries were im­plor­ing ci­ti­zens to stay home in the mid­dle of the year, Viet­nam res­i­dents were able to flock to scenic beaches as the gov­ern­ment tried to give the do­mes­tic tourism in­dus­try a much-needed shot in the arm.</p>
    <p>There were grave fears for the coun­try’s ex­port-re­liant economy as de­mand for cloth­ing, footwear and smart­phones slumped in some of its big­gest mar­kets, in­clud­ing the Euro­pean Union, Ja­pan and South Korea.</p>
    <p>“But it turned out that ex­ports still helped pro­mote growth this year,” Mr Thanh said. “That’s be­cause Viet­nam has a very diver­si­fied ex­port mar­ket – it’s not de­pen­dent on any sin­gle ex­port des­ti­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ship­ments to China grew more than 15 per cent year on year in the first nine months, ac­cord­ing to the Viet­nam Gen­eral Cus­toms Ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>De­mand for many items made in Viet­nam – such as home elec­tron­ics, of­fice fur­ni­ture, com­put­ers and tele­vi­sions – soared dur­ing the pan­demic as peo­ple were forced to stay home dur­ing lock­downs.</p>
    <p>This has meant that while it will fall short of its tar­get of 6.8 per cent growth this year, the economy is ex­pected to ex­pand 2.4 per cent, which the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) said would be among the best in the world.</p>
    <p>The IMF has fore­cast a global con­trac­tion of 4.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers said Viet­nam had also ben­e­fited from the United StatesChin­a trade war as com­pa­nies such as Ap­ple look to shift their sup­ply chains to avoid tar­iffs.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam’s ex­ports to the US rose by about one-quar­ter to US$54.7 bil­lion (S$72.7 bil­lion) in the first nine months of the year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ab­sence of for­eign trav­ellers has dealt a se­vere blow to the tourism sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The Unesco-recog­nised an­cient im­pe­rial city of Hue – which is pop­u­lar with for­eign vis­i­tors – now re­sem­bles a ghost town, with Thua Thien Hue province’s tourism de­part­ment say­ing that 80 per cent of ho­tels were closed, while 8,000 peo­ple had lost their jobs.</p>
    <p>“We are suf­fer­ing heav­ily from the pan­demic,” said provin­cial tourism de­part­ment deputy head Nguyen Van Phuc.</p>
    <p>It is a sim­i­larly grim story in Hanoi, where ho­tel owner Nguyen Dinh Toi – who runs ho­tels in Hanoi’s old quar­ter, Ha­long Bay and Sapa – said that “tourism has died”.</p>
    <p>“We sur­vived the Sars (se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome) epi­demic, the fi­nan­cial storm of 2009 to 2010... but now, the sit­u­a­tion is un­be­liev­able.”</p>
    <p>Still, Viet­nam’s economy is less ex­posed than other tourism-de­pen­dent coun­tries in the re­gion, such as Thai­land, where the IMF pre­dicts the economy to slump by 7.1 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>The Viet­namese gov­ern­ment has also helped cush­ion the eco­nomic blow by pour­ing money into in­fra­struc­ture projects such as roads and bridges, said Mr Thanh.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic in­vest­ment in the first 11 months of the year rose 34 per cent, the high­est in nine years, the gov­ern­ment said.</p>
