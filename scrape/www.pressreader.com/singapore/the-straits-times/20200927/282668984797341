    <p>Beau­ti­ful, in­tel­li­gent and a role model to mil­lions, su­per­model Ash­ley Gra­ham is now a mother.</p>
    <p>The body pos­i­tiv­ity ad­vo­cate chose Harper’s Bazaar for her first ma­jor shoot and interview fol­low­ing the birth of her baby boy in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Then the coro­n­avirus pan­demic took hold, and she and her fam­ily left New York to quar­an­tine in Ne­braska, where she was brought up. Rather than can­cel the shoot, the mag­a­zine asked Gra­ham’s hus­band, cin­e­matog­ra­pher Justin Ervin, if he would take the pho­to­graphs.</p>
    <p>Shot over two days amid the rolling grass­land and in the de­serted towns near her mother’s home, those in­ti­mate pic­tures of Gra­ham and her son Isaac, along with her mem­o­ries of the past mo­men­tous months, are a tes­ta­ment to the eter­nal joy of fam­ily love and the beauty to be found in the hu­man ex­pe­ri­ence even dur­ing an un­prece­dented cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Here, she talks about some of the mile­stones in her jour­ney to be­com­ing a mother for the first time.</p>
    <p>SPRING 2019</p>
    <p>Gra­ham was preg­nant with her first baby. “I was so ex­cited. I knew im­me­di­ately I was go­ing to be a great mum.”</p>
    <p>But the poster girl for body pos­i­tiv­ity found it un­ex­pect­edly hard to cope with the changes of her own body. “That was the wildest part. I thought, ‘What about the things I’ve told my­self? What about the af­fir­ma­tions I’ve gone through?’ None of th­ese mat­tered be­cause my body was chang­ing so rapidly. It re­ally took me some time to fig­ure it out men­tally, be­cause it was like there was an alien tak­ing over my body.”</p>
    <p>She thinks she had pre­na­tal de­pres­sion. “When you go from laugh­ing to cry­ing in 30 sec­onds, you do won­der if you are okay. Un­be­known to me, that’s preg­nancy.</p>
    <p>“One of the best things I did for my­self was to make preg­nant friends – and then I re­alised I wasn’t alone, I was nor­mal, and that calmed me down. I started to en­joy be­ing preg­nant in my third trimester.”</p>
    <p>JAN 18, 2020</p>
    <p>Gra­ham and her hus­band of 10 years had long ago de­cided on a home birth.</p>
    <p>At 7am, she woke up with con­trac­tions. Her plan was to con­tinue with the day: go out to brunch, take a yoga class and get a pedi­cure. But her wa­ters broke while she was do­ing a cat-cow stretch.</p>
    <p>“It was the first re­ally big con­trac­tion. I started cry­ing and I was like, wow, game on.”</p>
    <p>Two mid­wives and a doula ar­rived and set up a birthing pool in the liv­ing room of the cou­ple’s Brook­lyn apart­ment.</p>
    <p>“Justin wanted to be as help­ful as pos­si­ble and the mid­wife told him, ‘There’s noth­ing you can do, noth­ing.’ There’s a photo of him rub­bing my arm as I’m hang­ing over the edge of the pool, gaz­ing into the eyes of the mid­wife, who’s keep­ing me fo­cused and help­ing me count.</p>
    <p>“You can tell there’s a tear run­ning down his face – it was ag­o­nis­ing for him to see me in so much pain and not be able to do any­thing about it.”</p>
    <p>In the end, Ervin de­cided to make din­ner in case Gra­ham was hun­gry af­ter giv­ing birth. She says: “I was in the pool and I looked over to see him in the kitchen cut­ting up meat and adding sea­son­ing, be­cause it was all he could do.”</p>
    <p>A baby boy weigh­ing 3.3kg was born at 6.05pm. “It was a eu­phoric ex­pe­ri­ence, see­ing my son with my hus­band in the pool. We ma­noeu­vred into my bed­room and we all lay on our bed, and that was where he got weighed and mea­sured and ex­am­ined.”</p>
    <p>The baby is called Isaac.</p>
    <p>“When he was in high school, Justin de­cided that if he had a son, he would call him Isaac. In the Bi­ble, it means laugh­ter. We kept telling him that in utero, and sure enough, he came out with a smile on his face. He’s one of the hap­pi­est ba­bies I’ve ever met,” says Gra­ham.</p>
    <p>She later cam­paigned against coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols in hos­pi­tals that re­quire women to give birth alone. “If I hadn’t had my mid­wives or even Justin in the room, the whole ex­pe­ri­ence would have been very dif­fer­ent for me,” she says.</p>
    <p>In March, New York Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo signed an ex­ec­u­tive or­der al­low­ing all women in the state to have a part­ner in the de­liv­ery room.</p>
    <p>MARCH 12</p>
    <p>By this time, Isaac was al­most two months old and Gra­ham’s planned ma­ter­nity leave was draw­ing to a close. When she went back to mod­el­ling, her mother Linda was go­ing to help look af­ter the baby.</p>
    <p>But i n New York, cases of Covid-19 were mount­ing, res­i­dents were self-quar­an­tin­ing and the apart­ment had no out­side space. Linda sug­gested they all de­camp to the fam­ily home in Ne­braska.</p>
    <p>“She talked us into it. She said, ‘It’s 20 hours, let’s just go and I’ll drive all the way’,” says Gra­ham.</p>
    <p>They packed a suit­case each – “I thought we’d be away only a cou­ple of weeks” – and bor­rowed a friend’s sport util­ity ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>“Justin had just made a lamb roast and he said, ‘We’re not throw­ing this away’, so we put it in the back of the car and that was what we ate on the trip.”</p>
    <p>They left New York at 4am on Friday, March 13. “My mum says it’s nice to see the sun­rise in the car.”</p>
    <p>The 2,092km jour­ney took them in a straight line across Ohio, In­di­ana, Illi­nois and Iowa.</p>
    <p>En route, they lis­tened to pod­casts, Bill Withers and Aretha Franklin; ate cold lamb; and stopped only when Isaac needed a feed. Linda drove for the first 16 hours straight, Ervin took the last four and they ar­rived in Lin­coln, Ne­braska, around mid­night on the fol­low­ing day.</p>
    <p>SPRING</p>
    <p>The fam­ily is now en­sconced in the large, ranch-style house in which Gra­ham lived with her sis­ters from the age of 13, a short drive from the farm where her un­cle still grows corn.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the day, she and Ervin colonised the base­ment, which had been kit­ted out with yoga mats, weights and TRX re­sis­tance bands. “It’s big­ger than our en­tire Brook­lyn apart­ment,” says Gra­ham.</p>
    <p>Morn­ings started with an on­line work­out led by celebrity trainer Kira Stokes. Af­ter that, Gra­ham worked – in Zoom meet­ings or film­ing for her nu­mer­ous com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>“I’ve just shot for El­len­tube (Ellen DeGeneres’ YouTube chan­nel) – Justin had to set up three cam­eras, so thank God he’s a cin­e­matog­ra­pher. And we’ve fig­ured out how to shoot my podcast, Pretty Big Deal, re­motely.</p>
    <p>“But I’m also han­dling new­born stuff ev­ery day. The good thing is, if I tilt my com­puter screen up­wards, I can feed the baby with­out any­body see­ing.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter­noons were mostly ded­i­cated to Isaac. “He’s such an out­side baby – he likes the grass, he likes the sun.”</p>
    <p>Once a week, the cou­ple went on a date. “All we’re do­ing is driv­ing to the park, watch­ing the sun­set, hav­ing a kiss in the car. It’s the sim­plest thing, but it’s a game changer.”</p>
    <p>APRIL 7</p>
    <p>Af­ter the spring snow, the weather turned suf­fi­ciently sunny for the Harper’s Bazaar photo shoot.</p>
    <p>Ervin and the mag­a­zine’s cre­ative direc­tor Jo Goodby agreed on a vi­sion of clas­sic Amer­i­cana, in­spired by Gra­ham’s jour­ney across Amer­ica and the gen­tle hills and broad skies of Ne­braska.</p>
    <p>On Ervin’s mood board was a pic­ture of An­drew Wyeth’s fa­mous 1948 paint­ing, Christina’s World, show­ing a young woman ly­ing in a wide, grassy land­scape, gaz­ing up at a dis­tant house.</p>
    <p>Gra­ham says: “Justin saw this one lit­tle white house on a hill and that be­came the fo­cal point for the whole shoot.”</p>
    <p>They de­cided to work in two lo­ca­tions: the nearby fields of the Pioneers Park na­ture re­serve and on Gra­ham’s un­cle’s farm, an hour away.</p>
    <p>A lim­ited se­lec­tion of clothes had been sent di­rectly to the house, but lock­down guide­lines meant that no out­siders could join the shoot.</p>
    <p>On the day, the team con­sisted only of Gra­ham, Ervin, Linda and her boyfriend, Michael.</p>
    <p>“Michael was Justin’s per­sonal as­sis­tant, light­ing man, the guy who did the Star­bucks run. My mum was tak­ing care of Isaac the whole time, car­ry­ing him in a front-fac­ing sling, but she was also hold­ing a light re­flec­tor.”</p>
    <p>Gra­ham did her own hair and make-up. “I kept it easy breezy, I let my hair air-dry and I didn’t even wear mas­cara be­cause I’m the kind of girl who runs around like this. I also did the styling and helped to art di­rect.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ervin was the pho­tog­ra­pher, cin­e­matog­ra­pher, art direc­tor and fash­ion as­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one knew his role, but man, it was a lot of work,” Gra­ham says.</p>
    <p>Shot over two af­ter­noons – “We wanted the beau­ti­ful, magic-hour light” – it was one of the most per­son­ally mean­ing­ful shoots she had ever par­tic­i­pated in.</p>
    <p>“We took one pic­ture in­side my grand­fa­ther’s truck. He (died) six years ago and my mum left ev­ery­thing in­side the same, from his ChapStick to his li­cence in the vi­sor and the money in the ash­tray.</p>
    <p>“There were five more min­utes of sun­light; my mum was on one side with a re­flec­tor, Michael was on the other side with another re­flec­tor and we got the shot.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber look­ing at the photo and think­ing, ‘This is so cool. The four of us put this to­gether, and it’s so cin­e­matic.’ It’s a beau­ti­ful mo­ment to look back on dur­ing th­ese weird times, and to re­mem­ber that we had so much joy.”</p>
    <p>APRIL 29</p>
    <p>Gra­ham Skyped the mag­a­zine from the base­ment of her mother’s ranch, hav­ing just fin­ished a work­out with Stokes. She was not wear­ing make-up, her hair was pulled back from her face and she was in a sweat­shirt and leg­gings, but she could grace any mag­a­zine cover.</p>
    <p>De­spite the fact that Isaac had been wak­ing her ev­ery cou­ple of hours to feed, her skin was flaw­less, her eyes wide and bright.</p>
    <p>“I ac­tu­ally feel re­ally good,” she says. “I don’t know what it is – mother re­silience? I’ve learnt that I can func­tion with­out sleep – I didn’t know that.”</p>
    <p>It was not the only source of sur­prise. The weeks of quar­an­tine brought some worry and sad­ness – the cou­ple lost a friend to Covid-19 and many other friends con­tracted the ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, she says, “the sil­ver lin­ing is hav­ing all of th­ese in­cred­i­ble, spe­cial mo­ments with Isaac and the nostal­gia of be­ing with my son in the home I grew up in. I’ve had time to fo­cus and I’m so grate­ful”.</p>
    <p>Once the cri­sis is past, Gra­ham be­lieves so­ci­ety will “have a deeper re­spect for pa­tience, kind­ness and grat­i­tude. And I re­ally want to be that role model for my son”.</p>
