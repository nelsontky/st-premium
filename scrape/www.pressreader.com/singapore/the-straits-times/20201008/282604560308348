    <p>WIN­TER IS COM­ING, LET’S SWIM: Cap­tain Amer­ica ac­tor Chris Evans is mak­ing the most of pool time be­fore win­ter sets in.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old turned up the heat by post­ing a video on In­sta­gram of him do­ing a back­flip into a swim­ming pool on Tues­day. His cap­tion: “Last swim be­fore the pool hi­ber­nates... (It was freez­ing.)”.</p>
    <p>The shirt­less Marvel star’s chis­elled torso and vast col­lec­tion of tat­toos are on full dis­play as he is seen in a pair of black swim­ming shorts.</p>
    <p>Evans, who had ac­ci­den­tally leaked an ex­plicit pic­ture last month, took a dig at his pale skin with the cap­tion: “I won­der what it’s like to be tan.”</p>
    <p>He was one of many celebri­ties who took to Twit­ter on Tues­day to slam United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump for his “Don’t be afraid of Covid” re­mark af­ter he was dis­charged from hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor wrote: “You’ve been un­der round-the-clock care by the best doc­tors us­ing the best drugs. Do you re­ally think ev­ery­one has ac­cess to that?! Sadly, I’m sure you’re aware of that dis­par­ity, you just don’t care. This is reck­less to a shock­ing de­gree, even for you.”</p>
