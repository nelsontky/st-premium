    <p>Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den has been elected the next Pres­i­dent of the United States, mak­ing Mr Don­ald Trump the first oneterm pres­i­dent in nearly 30 years.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor news net­works, in­clud­ing Fox, called vic­tory for Mr Bi­den and his run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris after his lead in the bat­tle­ground state of Penn­syl­va­nia stretched to 34,200. That win net­ted him 20 elec­toral votes and brought his to­tal to 273 – ex­ceed­ing the 270 needed to win the White House.</p>
    <p>As the next vice-pres­i­dent, Sen­a­tor Har­ris will make his­tory as the first black woman and first per­son of South Asian de­scent to hold the sec­ond-high­est of­fice in the US.</p>
    <p>“I am hon­oured and hum­bled by the trust the Amer­i­can peo­ple have placed in me and in vice-pres­i­dent-elect Har­ris,” Mr Bi­den, who served as sen­a­tor for Delaware from 1973 to 2009 and as vice-pres­i­dent from 2009 to 2016 un­der Pres­i­dent Barack Obama, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“In the face of un­prece­dented ob­sta­cles, a record num­ber of Amer­i­cans voted. Prov­ing once again, that democ­racy beats deep in the heart of Amer­ica.”</p>
    <p>CNN was the first to make the call that Mr Bi­den had won Penn­syl­va­nia and there­fore the presidency, fol­lowed within min­utes by ABC, NBC, CBS, the As­so­ci­ated Press and CNN.</p>
    <p>Net­works later also called Ne­vada and Ari­zona for Mr Bi­den, bring­ing his vote tally to 284, but it was his vic­tory in Penn­syl­va­nia that closed off Mr Trump’s path to re-elec­tion. Mr Trump, who was re­port­edly play­ing golf when he got the news, said he would not con­cede de­feat.</p>
    <p>His ini­tial lead in Penn­syl­va­nia, Ge­or­gia and other states where count­ing was still on­go­ing was grad­u­ally whit­tled down as mail-in bal­lots and votes from ur­ban cen­tres were counted.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who will be Amer­ica’s 46th pres­i­dent, will also be its old­est when he is sworn into of­fice in Jan­uary. He turns 78 in two weeks.</p>
    <p>He also won the pop­u­lar vote, net­ting a record 74.8 mil­lion votes so far – over 4.3 mil­lion votes more than Mr Trump, whose tally stands at 70.6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Vow­ing defiance, the Trump cam­paign has mounted le­gal chal­lenges on var­i­ous fronts that elec­tion of­fi­cials, po­lit­i­cal an­a­lysts, and the Bi­den cam­paign have called base­less.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion came amid a pan­demic that has killed nearly 240,000 Amer­i­cans so far and after a sum­mer of racial jus­tice protests, and re­vealed a deeply di­vided Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Cam­paign­ing on a plat­form of unity and heal­ing, Mr Bi­den charted a course to vic­tory by re­build­ing the “blue wall” – the tra­di­tion­ally Demo­cratic states in the up­per Mid­west of Michi­gan, Wis­con­sin and Penn­syl­va­nia that Mr Trump won in 2016.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den flipped them all.</p>
    <p>He is also ahead in Ge­or­gia, where he would be the first Demo­crat to win the state since 1992, and in Ari­zona, which no Demo­crat has won since 1996. The only bat­tle­ground state where count­ing is still go­ing on that Mr Trump could win is North Carolina.</p>
    <p>Promis­ing to be a pres­i­dent for “all Amer­i­cans”, Mr Bi­den called for Amer­i­cans to come to­gether and be­gin the process of heal­ing.</p>
    <p>“With the cam­paign over, it’s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric be­hind us and come to­gether as a na­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris tweeted: “This elec­tion is about so much more than Joe Bi­den or me. It’s about the soul of Amer­ica and our will­ing­ness to fight for it. We have a lot of work ahead of us. Let’s get started.”</p>
    <p>It may have been a nar­row win, but it was de­ci­sive: A ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans by any mea­sure – pop­u­lar vote or Elec­toral Col­lege – re­jected four more years of</p>
    <p>Don­ald J. Trump.</p>
    <p>And de­spite in­tense pres­sure from crowds, court cases and con­spir­acy the­o­rists, its dogged demo­cratic process did not fail the United States of Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>It will not be easy for Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den to man­age a bit­terly di­vided coun­try. But he brings vast ex­pe­ri­ence from al­most half a cen­tury of nav­i­gat­ing Wash­ing­ton and the world, eight of those years as vice-pres­i­dent to Mr Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>And very sig­nif­i­cantly, Mr Bi­den, 77, rep­re­sents a bridge to Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris, 56, who will be the first black woman and first per­son of South Asian de­scent to hold the na­tion’s sec­ond-high­est of­fice, plac­ing her a heart­beat from the presidency it­self, and in pole po­si­tion for a run at the White House in 2024.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic Party ticket’s win came on the back of a record turnout of 160 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to pre­lim­i­nary data – a fall­out, an­a­lysts say, of the in­tense po­lar­i­sa­tion and sense of ur­gency over this elec­tion. And that in the mid­dle of a deadly pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We owe this win to black, in­dige­nous, young peo­ple of colour, and new im­mi­grant vot­ers who flooded the polls de­spite sig­nif­i­cant bar­ri­ers to fight for a bet­ter fu­ture for all of us,” the Bi­den-Har­ris ad­vo­cacy group 350.org said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who is due to be in­au­gu­rated on Jan 20 next year, is al­ready putting to­gether a tran­si­tion team, though Pres­i­dent Trump is still in­sist­ing he has been cheated of vic­tory, and may take his bat­tle to the courts.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less an­a­lysts ex­pect that, if all goes to plan, in his first weeks in of­fice, Mr Bi­den is likely to re­store cli­mate change to the cen­tre of pol­i­cy­mak­ing in Wash­ing­ton, with the US recom­mit­ting to the Paris Agree­ment on curb­ing global warm­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr An­drew Steer, pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the World Re­sources In­sti­tute, said in an e-mail: “It’s a new day for is­sues that are crit­i­cal for Amer­i­cans’ health and well-be­ing and for the planet.”</p>
    <p>The US will also very likely re-en­gage with the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, and will likely restart diplo­matic di­a­logue with Iran. A more broad-based di­a­logue with China will likely re­sume even as strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion re­mains.</p>
    <p>Es­sen­tially, after four years of per­son­al­ity-cen­tric mega­phone diplo­macy from Mr Trump, Mr Bi­den will re­store a mea­sure of tra­di­tional diplo­macy, in­clud­ing re­pair­ing re­la­tions with al­lies in Europe and Asia jolted by Mr Trump’s abra­sive trans­ac­tional ap­proach.</p>
    <p>In­ter­nal ten­sion in the US will cer­tainly still be hard to nav­i­gate.</p>
    <p>“Trump­ism will re­main a ma­jor force in US pol­i­tics,” said pro­fes­sor of in­ter­na­tional pol­i­tics In­der­jeet Par­mar at the City, Univer­sity of Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“A pow­er­ful Left aided by Black Lives Mat­ter and… young peo­ple in­debted and rag­ing against cli­mate change will de­mand rad­i­cal re­forms; and the world will be wary of US un­pre­dictabil­ity and the pos­si­ble re­turn of Trump in 2024,” Dr Par­mar told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic and its eco­nomic fall­out de­mand mas­sive state ac­tion at least tem­po­rar­ily,” he said.</p>
    <p>On the diplo­matic front, he thought a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would seek to re­store a sem­blance of nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>Milken In­sti­tute Asia fel­low Cur­tis Chin, a for­mer US am­bas­sador to the Asian Devel­op­ment Bank, told ST that</p>
