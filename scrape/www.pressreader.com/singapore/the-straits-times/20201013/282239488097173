    <p>Valt­teri Bot­tas has ad­mit­ted he needs a mir­a­cle to stop Mercedes team­mate Lewis Hamil­ton from claim­ing a record­e­qualling sev­enth For­mula One cham­pi­onship, but he has no in­ten­tion of con­ced­ing de­feat un­til the con­test is math­e­mat­i­cally im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The Finn, who was forced to re­tire on lap 19 of Sun­day’s Eifel Grand Prix af­ter suf­fer­ing a power fail­ure, is now 69 points be­hind the Bri­ton who equalled Michael Schu­macher’s record of 91 race wins in Ger­many. It was Hamil­ton’s sev­enth win in 11 races this sea­son and, re­mark­ably, ex­tended his record run of con­sec­u­tive fin­ishes in the points to 44.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand the gap to Lewis is now pretty big in the points,” Bot­tas said, with char­ac­ter­is­tic un­der­state­ment. “So, I would defini­tively need a mir­a­cle, but, as al­ways, there’s no point in giv­ing up. I have to keep the bar high for me and keep try­ing... I think that’s the best mind­set – there’s no point now to non-stop cal­cu­late the points for Lewis.</p>
    <p>“For me, the mind­set is to never give up. It’s still with me so – no chance to get out of it.”</p>
    <p>With six races re­main­ing, start­ing in Por­tu­gal in two weeks, Hamil­ton has such a lux­u­ri­ous cush­ion that he is only likely to let a sev­enth ti­tle slip if he has at least three non-fin­ishes.</p>
    <p>But while the for­mer Wil­liams driver can­not ac­count for mechanical fail­ure, Nico Ros­berg, who pipped Hamil­ton to the 2016 cham­pi­onship, still felt his re­place­ment has not done enough to chal­lenge the Sil­ver Ar­rows’ No. 1 driver.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man told Sky Sports, “It’s such a big gap that it’s go­ing to be al­most im­pos­si­ble for Valt­teri to close up.”</p>
