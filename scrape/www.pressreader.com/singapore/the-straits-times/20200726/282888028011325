    <p>They are no longer just shop­ping for the usual lux­ury goods.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has made those who can af­ford it to look for safe havens, not to park their cash, but as a refuge for them­selves.</p>
    <p>The next time the world’s rich are forced into lock­down, they would like to have an es­cape ready to a re­mote and sunny beach. Or per­haps to New Zealand, one of the few coun­tries that have elim­i­nated Covid-19.</p>
    <p>They are will­ing to pay for the priv­i­lege, of course.</p>
    <p>They can turn to pro­grammes that guar­an­tee cit­i­zen­ship or res­i­dency in ex­change for in­vest­ment in the host coun­try, us­ing spe­cial­ity com­pa­nies such as Hen­ley & Part­ners, the world’s big­gest cit­i­zen­ship and res­i­dency ad­vi­sory firm. With the per­sis­tent threat of vi­ral in­fec­tions and sud­den lock­downs, the com­pany is help­ing those with deep pock­ets buy ac­cess to a safe haven.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, you can ac­quire the right to live, work and study in New Zealand if you part with NZ$3 mil­lion (S$2.75 mil­lion) or NZ$10 mil­lion, de­pend­ing on the type of in­vestor res­i­dent visa you choose.</p>
    <p>About €1.2 mil­lion (S$1.9 mil­lion), in­clud­ing a prop­erty pur­chase, will get a mar­ried cou­ple cit­i­zen­ship in Malta.</p>
    <p>“They’re now re­al­is­ing: Let’s ac­tu­ally get the con­tin­gency plan in place,” said Mr Do­minic Volek, Hen­ley’s head of sales, of his po­ten­tial cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“That’s why we’ve seen quite a spike now, not only in in­quiries, but also in the fam­i­lies ac­tu­ally sign­ing up and say­ing, ‘Let’s start the process’.”</p>
    <p>New in­quiries jumped 49 per cent in the first four months of this year, com­pared with the same pe­riod in 2019, ac­cord­ing to the com­pany. There was a 22 per cent in­crease in those want­ing to pro­ceed with an ap­pli­ca­tion for new cit­i­zen­ship or res­i­dency rights.</p>
    <p>The wealthy are not just in­ter­ested in Caribbean is­lands where they can self-iso­late on sandy beaches. They’re also look­ing to Aus­tralia and New Zealand, coun­tries that im­pressed with their han­dling of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ms Na­dine Gold­foot, a man­ag­ing part­ner at law firm Fragomen, said the pan­demic has driven wealthy peo­ple to take ac­tion. “What is be­com­ing and will con­tinue to be very im­por­tant now in peo­ple’s se­lec­tion process is how the coun­try has fared dur­ing the pan­demic and how the gov­ern­ment has ap­proached it,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, peo­ple view the move as a wealth-man­age­ment tool as much as a way to travel visa-free, ac­cord­ing to Hen­ley.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est in Por­tu­gal’s res­i­denceby-in­vest­ment pro­gramme in­creased in re­cent months, at­tract­ing clients hop­ing to in­vest in the coun­try’s sta­ble real es­tate mar­ket and take ad­van­tage of its rel­a­tively low coro­n­avirus case count.</p>
    <p>To be sure, even the world’s wealth­i­est can’t es­cape im­me­di­ate quar­an­tines and travel bans. Re­ceiv­ing sec­ond pass­ports or res­i­dency rights takes time – at least three months for Caribbean pro­grammes and much longer for the ones in the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Still, even as travel-re­lated busi­nesses suf­fer, Hen­ley is ex­pand­ing. The com­pany re­cently es­tab­lished an of­fice in Nige­ria and will soon open another in In­dia, where surg­ing coro­n­avirus cases and ten­sions on the bor­der with China have seen as in­crease in the num­ber of wealthy In­di­ans plan­ning for a po­ten­tial es­cape.</p>
    <p>Given that the virus and re­lated lock­downs are “a risk peo­ple are go­ing to be liv­ing with for the time be­ing, they want to be some­where where that’s a man­age­able ex­pe­ri­ence”, Fragomen’s Ms Gold­foot said.</p>
