    <p>PHILADEL­PHIA • Sup­port­ers of Demo­crat Joe Bi­den banged pots, honked their car horns and set off fire­works across cities i n the United States after their can­di­date cap­tured the presidency in a nar­row win over Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>Min­utes after ma­jor television net­works de­clared Mr Bi­den the win­ner fol­low­ing four nail-bit­ing days since last Tues­day’s elec­tion, peo­ple streamed to the White House to cel­e­brate out­side a se­cu­rity fence as the sound of boom­ing fire­works was heard in the distance.</p>
    <p>In nearby Dupont Cir­cle, sev­eral hun­dred peo­ple formed a pa­rade, play­ing music, singing and danc­ing, and marched to­wards the White House to the sound of honk­ing horns and clang­ing cow­bells.</p>
    <p>Loud cheers erupted in the halls of the ho­tel where Bi­den aides are stay­ing. “Worth ev­ery minute” of the wait, said one of the aides.</p>
    <p>Cam­paign staff ex­changed el­bow bumps and air hugs in the ho­tel lobby.</p>
    <p>In the New York bor­ough of Brook­lyn, cars honked and peo­ple pumped their fists and cheered on the streets.</p>
    <p>“The night­mare is over,” said Mr An­drew Ravin, 45, while his neigh­bour Ken­neth Henry, 51, said: “We can breathe again.”</p>
    <p>In Detroit the day be­fore, sev­eral hun­dred sup­port­ers of Pres­i­dent Trump, some car­ry­ing guns, had raised pre­ma­ture chants of “We won!” out­side a vote-count­ing cen­tre for Michi­gan’s largest city, de­spite news or­gan­i­sa­tions hav­ing called the state for Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Some Trump sup­port­ers, tak­ing a cue from the Pres­i­dent, had in­sisted that some­thing must be wrong with any count show­ing Mr Bi­den win­ning, and brought ri­fles and hand­guns with them to ral­lies out­side tab­u­la­tion cen­tres in Detroit and Phoenix.</p>
    <p>Wear­ing “Make Amer­ica Great Again” red base­ball caps and other pro-Trump garb, some fell to their knees in pub­lic prayer.</p>
    <p>Mr Ge­orge Vosca, 72, a re­tired Illi­nois gov­ern­ment em­ployee, drove for an hour with his wife to join a pro-Trump rally out­side the Wis­con­sin state Capi­tol build­ing in Madi­son.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard to be­lieve that we all went to bed Tues­day night and Trump was so far ahead and now he’s be­hind,” said Mr Vosca.</p>
