    <p>GRAND PRIX WINS LEWIS HAMILTON HAS, AF­TER LAT­EST VIC­TORY AT SPA</p>
    <p>SPA-FRAN­COR­CHAMPS • Lewis Hamilton may be 35, but the “fault­less” Bri­ton is not slow­ing down at all as he clinched yet an­other win at the Bel­gian Grand Prix yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The six-time world cham­pion was vic­to­ri­ous at Spa-Fran­cor­champs in a Mercedes one-two with Valt­teri Bot­tas, as Max Ver­stap­pen fin­ished third for Red Bull.</p>
    <p>The top three were in the same or­der through­out the whole race.</p>
    <p>Hamilton’s 89th ca­reer vic­tory left him two wins short of former Fer­rari great Michael Schu­macher’s all-time record of 91.</p>
    <p>He told Sky F1’s Martin Brun­dle: “It wasn’t the eas­i­est of races. I had a lock-up into Turn Five and then one into the last cor­ner.</p>
    <p>“It was a bit of a strug­gle. I was ner­vous... but we just keep our heads down. It’s an in­cred­i­ble men­tal­ity to work around. I’m 35, go­ing on 36, but I feel bet­ter than ever. I’m re­ally grate­ful to the team.”</p>
    <p>The win stretched his lead at the top of the driv­ers’ stand­ings to a mas­sive 47 points – nearly the equiv­a­lent of two race wins.</p>
    <p>Bot­tas, who is third in the stand­ings be­hind Hamilton and Ver­stap­pen, was 8.448 sec­onds be­hind his team­mate. He said: “I just couldn’t catch him on the straight. Lewis was fault­less to­day.”</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen took his sixth con­sec­u­tive podium fin­ish this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“There wasn’t much to do. I couldn’t re­ally keep up with the Mercedes,” he told Brun­dle.</p>
    <p>“I was catch­ing up to Valt­teri but they told him to speed up and I couldn’t keep up.”</p>
    <p>The race was largely in­ci­dent­free with the ex­cep­tion of an early crash in­volv­ing Alfa Romeo’s An­to­nio Giov­inazzi and Wil­liams’ Ge­orge Russell.</p>
    <p>The Re­nault pair of Daniel Ric­cia­rdo and Este­ban Ocon were fourth and fifth, as Alex Al­bon fin­ished sixth in the sec­ond Red Bull.</p>
    <p>McLaren’s Lando Nor­ris, Al­phaTauri’s Pierre Gasly, and the two Rac­ing Points of Lance Stroll and Ser­gio Perez rounded off the top 10.</p>
    <p>Fer­rari, win­ners in Bel­gium for the last two years, had no points this time round with Se­bas­tian Vet­tel and Charles Le­clerc fin­ish­ing 13th and 14th re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The Ital­ian team’s lack of speed was laid bare down the Spa track’s long straights, with ri­vals pick­ing them off with ease.</p>
    <p>Their form even drew a shake of the head from Car­los Sainz, who is set to re­place Vet­tel next sea­son. The Spa­niard did not start the race as his McLaren car suf­fered an ex­haust fail­ure.</p>
    <p>As has been all sea­son, there were no fans to wit­ness the ac­tion. But the suc­ces­sion of be­hind closed door races this sea­son is set to end as al­most 3,000 fans will be al­lowed to at­tend the Sept 11-13 Tus­cany Grand Prix at Mugello, the Ital­ian cir­cuit con­firmed. The Fer­rar­i­owned Mugello is where Hamilton can break Schu­macher’s mark at the ear­li­est, with the Ital­ian Grand Prix slated for Monza this week­end.</p>
