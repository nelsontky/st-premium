    <p>The World Eco­nomic Fo­rum (WEF) an­nual meet­ing will now take place in Sin­ga­pore from May 25 to 28, nearly two weeks later than pre­vi­ously stated.</p>
    <p>This is ac­cord­ing to an up­date on the WEF’s web­site. The con­fer­ence, which gath­ers top po­lit­i­cal, busi­ness and aca­demic lead­ers to dis­cuss press­ing global is­sues, was orig­i­nally sched­uled to be held from May 13 to 16.</p>
    <p>Hari Raya Puasa falls on May 13. The WEF did not re­spond to queries on when and why the meet­ing date was changed.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to shift the meet­ing to Sin­ga­pore from Switzer­land was made in the light of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Europe. It will re­turn to Davos in 2022.</p>
    <p>Last year’s meet­ing in Jan­uary saw about 3,000 par­tic­i­pants gather in Davos. This year’s fo­rum will, for the first time, in­clude a vir­tual com­po­nent to al­low for greater par­tic­i­pa­tion dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Par­lia­ment on Tues­day, Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Alvin Tan said all WEF par­tic­i­pants will have to abide by strict public health re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude un­der­go­ing a rig­or­ous Covid-19 test­ing reg­i­men in­volv­ing pre-de­par­ture and on-ar­rival tests, as well as ad­her­ing to strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said mea­sures will also be put in place to man­age the in­ter­ac­tions between the lo­cal com­mu­nity and the event at­ten­dees.</p>
    <p>Spe­cific public health re­quire­ments and con­tin­gency plans are cur­rently be­ing worked out, and will take into con­sid­er­a­tion the lat­est sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore and around the world.</p>
    <p>He added that the Gov­ern­ment has been in­tro­duc­ing in­ter­ested lo­cal firms and ser­vice providers to WEF and its event or­gan­iser, Publi­cisLive, for po­ten­tial part­ner­ships.</p>
