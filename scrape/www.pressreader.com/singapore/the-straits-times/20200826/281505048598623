    <p>The two men be­hind a Sin­ga­por­ereg­is­tered com­pany that has made a move to take over New­cas­tle United have taken down the web­site of a foun­da­tion linked to them, say­ing that it had been “re­leased pre­ma­turely”.</p>
    <p>The Loh Broth­ers Foun­da­tion at the Web ad­dress www.lo­hbroth­ers­foun­da­tion.org was re­moved yes­ter­day evening, fol­low­ing queries by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Cousins Nel­son Loh, 40, and Ter­ence Loh, 42, are co-founders of the Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group that has made a bid for the English Premier League foot­ball club.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, they said that “cer­tain er­rant in­di­vid­u­als” had put up the web­site of the foun­da­tion, which claimed as its board mem­bers Sin­ga­pore Ex­change Reg­u­la­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Tan Boon Gin and Se­nior Coun­sel Sreeni­vasan Narayanan, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands from sources that Mr Tan is not a board mem­ber of the foun­da­tion, al­though Mr Sreeni­vasan is.</p>
    <p>The Lohs did not ad­dress this, but said in their joint state­ment that they had re­cently dis­cov­ered the ex­is­tence of the web­site.</p>
    <p>“While we had in­tended to set up a char­i­ta­ble foun­da­tion and had pur­chased the said do­main name, the en­tity has yet to be set up. It ap­pears that the con­tent of the web­site were re­leased pre­ma­turely and we are tak­ing steps to ad­dress this,” they said.</p>
    <p>“The pre­ma­ture post­ing of the con­tent of the web­site ap­pears to be the re­sult of the ac­tions of cer­tain er­rant in­di­vid­u­als,” they added.</p>
    <p>The two men had spo­ken about a Loh Foun­da­tion in in­ter­views in 2018 and last year with var­i­ous me­dia.</p>
    <p>In a 2018 pro­file story in The Peak mag­a­zine, they said that they had es­tab­lished a “Loh Foun­da­tion Gir­ton Col­lege (Univer­sity of Cam­bridge) Schol­ar­ship” to spon­sor up to two Sin­ga­porean un­der­grad­u­ates ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>An in­ter­view in The Robb Re­port pub­lished last year had said that the two men would have set up the Loh Foun­da­tion by the end of last year.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Loh Broth­ers Foun­da­tion web­site was taken down yes­ter­day, it had fea­tured pho­tos of the two cousins, who had of­ten said in in­ter­views that they were as close as broth­ers.</p>
    <p>A de­scrip­tion un­der the site’s About Us sec­tion said the men seek to “pos­i­tively im­pact com­mu­ni­ties by pro­vid­ing through sports pro­grammes and ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>Other pages on the web­site had high­lighted the sports spon­sor­ship and ed­u­ca­tion schol­ar­ships that the cousins had given out through com­pa­nies or en­ti­ties they founded or were linked to.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes the Novu Racing Team which the foun­da­tion web­site said had sup­ported Sin­ga­porean race-car driver Yuey Tan since 2012.</p>
    <p>It also had listed their con­tri­bu­tions as “pa­trons of the Hong Kah (Gek Poh) grass­roots com­mu­nity” and said they had “made tremen­dous con­tri­bu­tions over the last 10 years to fund var­i­ous Sin­ga­pore grass­roots char­ity events, such as char­ity tour­na­ments, built two PAP Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion preschools and worked with Playeum (a chil­dren’s not-for-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion)”.</p>
    <p>The web­site had stated that the foun­da­tion’s other board mem­bers, apart from Mr Tan and Mr Sreeni­vasan, are the two Mr Lohs and Mr Yi Bao who is listed as the chair­man of Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy com­pany Megvii Face++.</p>
    <p>The re­moval of the web­site fol­lows sim­i­lar with­drawals of other web­pages and press re­leases linked to the BN Group or its en­ti­ties as more dis­crep­an­cies about their claims emerged.</p>
