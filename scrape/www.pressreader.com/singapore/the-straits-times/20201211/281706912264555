    <p>The peo­ple, es­pe­cially the poor, are af­fected by the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic, where some have lost their jobs and in­come. The peo­ple should not be be­trayed due to the in­flu­ence of the emo­tional grudge over con­ser­va­tive po­lit­i­cal think­ing.</p>
    <p>SUL­TAN NAZRIN SHAH, after the swear­ing-in cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>KUALA KANGSAR • Perak ruler Sul­tan Nazrin Shah crit­i­cised the Malaysian state’s as­sem­bly­men after yes­ter­day’s swear­ing-in cer­e­mony of new Men­teri Be­sar Saarani Mo­hamad, the third such cer­e­mony to be held since the gen­eral elec­tion in May 2018.</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Nazrin said the oc­ca­sion was not some­thing to be proud of, but was in­stead a re­flec­tion of fail­ure in the his­tory of the Perak state assem­bly.</p>
    <p>“The politi­cians have con­sis­tently failed in se­cur­ing a strong sup­port and this may have dis­tracted them from fo­cus­ing on spend­ing time and en­ergy to ad­min­is­ter the best for the peo­ple,” said the ruler.</p>
    <p>“As­sem­bly­men were cho­sen by the peo­ple be­cause they trusted them (as­sem­bly­men) to carry out the re­spon­si­bil­ity to pro­vide ser­vices and up­grade their econ­omy as well as their so­cial needs.</p>
    <p>“The peo­ple, es­pe­cially the poor, are af­fected by the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic, where some have lost their jobs and in­come. The peo­ple should not be be­trayed due to the in­flu­ence of the emo­tional grudge over con­ser­va­tive po­lit­i­cal think­ing,” he said after the swear­ing-in cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Datuk Saarani, who is the as­sem­bly­man for Kota Tam­pan and chair­man of Umno in Perak, was ap­pointed after for­mer men­teri be­sar Ah­mad Faizal Azumu was ousted in a con­fi­dence vote filed by Umno last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Faizal’s re­moval ex­posed a rift be­tween Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia and Umno, who are al­lies in the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) pact that gov­erns in Perak state as well as at the fed­eral level.</p>
    <p>The al­liance re­solved the Perak lead­er­ship cri­sis on Wed­nes­day, when its mem­ber par­ties agreed to back Mr Saarani as the new men­teri be­sar and forge closer ties with each other.</p>
    <p>“The par­ties agreed to strengthen co­op­er­a­tion be­tween par­ties in the Perikatan gov­ern­ment in Perak and at the fed­eral level for po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and har­mony,” said the joint state­ment is­sued on Wed­nes­day by lead­ers from the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional (BN) al­liance, Ber­satu and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS).</p>
    <p>It was also re­vealed that BN chair­man Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi had apol­o­gised on be­half of BN’s Perak as­sem­bly­men for vot­ing against Mr Faizal last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>In the 59-seat state assem­bly, Umno holds 25 seats, Ber­satu five, PAS three and Ger­akan one, with one seat held by an in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion coali­tion Pakatan Hara­pan holds 24 seats – com­pris­ing 16 from the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP), three from Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat and five from Parti Amanah Ne­gara.</p>
    <p>Last week­end, Zahid, who is also Umno pres­i­dent, had said it was open to work­ing with all par­ties, in­clud­ing the op­po­si­tion, to form the gov­ern­ment in Perak.</p>
    <p>DAP re­sponded pos­i­tively to the over­ture, say­ing it would con­sider team­ing up with Umno, a long­stand­ing ri­val, in the in­ter­ests of the state.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with the PN pact re­main­ing in­tact, Mr Saarani is now backed by a suf­fi­cient ma­jor­ity to govern with­out need­ing sup­port from the op­po­si­tion.</p>
