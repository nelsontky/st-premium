    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral bank will likely keep pol­icy set­tings steady in Oc­to­ber on hopes that the econ­omy will re­cover as the fi­nan­cial hub fur­ther loosens coro­n­avirus curbs and on ex­pec­ta­tions that fis­cal pol­icy will be the main driver of a re­bound, a Reuters poll showed.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) will keep its mon­e­tary pol­icy set­tings un­changed at its bian­nual meet­ing due to take place no later than Oct 14, ac­cord­ing to all 13 econ­o­mists in the poll.</p>
    <p>It comes as the trans­port and tourism hub faces its big­gest down­turn ever, with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic seen to wipe out years of eco­nomic ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>“Do­mes­tic de­mand is likely go­ing to re­cover with the mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions set to fur­ther ease in Q4, but ex­ter­nal de­mand re­mains un­cer­tain as trad­ing part­ners con­tinue to grap­ple with the Covid-19 out­break,” said Ms Sung Eun Jung at Ox­ford Eco­nom­ics, bet­ting the MAS would main­tain its ac­com­moda­tive stance.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral bank man­ages mon­e­tary pol­icy through ex­change rate set­tings, let­ting the lo­cal dol­lar rise or fall against the cur­ren­cies of its main trad­ing part­ners within an undis­closed band.</p>
    <p>It de­liv­ered its big­gest eas­ing move since the 2009 fi­nan­cial cri­sis at its March meet­ing, by flat­ten­ing the band’s rate of in­crease and ef­fec­tively shift­ing its cen­tre lower. The MAS has said fis­cal pol­icy was the “cen­tre­piece” of the eco­nomic re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has pumped nearly $100 bil­lion worth of stim­u­lus into the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists say the worst may be over for the bell­wether econ­omy that con­tracted a record 13.2 per cent year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter, but warn the re­cov­ery is likely to be slug­gish.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 case num­bers fall­ing lo­cally, the coun­try has been grad­u­ally lift­ing some of its lock­down mea­sures to re­open its econ­omy in re­cent months and has sig­nalled it wants to slowly re­sume tourism and travel.</p>
    <p>The trade-re­liant econ­omy’s ex­ports have mostly held up this year, sup­ported by global de­mand for Sin­ga­pore’s phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal prod­ucts, but there are con­cerns about whether ex­port growth is sus­tain­able given the slug­gish global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic de­mand is likely go­ing to re­cover with the mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions set to fur­ther ease in Q4, but ex­ter­nal de­mand re­mains un­cer­tain as trad­ing part­ners con­tinue to grap­ple with the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
