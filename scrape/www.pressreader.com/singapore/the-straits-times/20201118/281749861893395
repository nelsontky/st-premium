    <p>With coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions con­tin­u­ing to surge world­wide and vac­cines yet to be re­leased, the need for ac­cu­rate health re­port­ing and ev­i­dence-based jour­nal­ism around Covid-19 is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>To bet­ter pre­pare news­rooms for fu­ture health-re­lated crises or large-scale sci­ence emer­gen­cies, the World Ed­i­tors Fo­rum – WanIfra’s net­work for ed­i­tors – will be host­ing the Sci­ence In The News­room Global eSum­mit 2020.</p>
    <p>The on­line event, ti­tled Jour­nal­ism In The Age Of The Pan­demic, is de­signed to help news­rooms draw lessons from ex­ist­ing Covid-19 cov­er­age and build com­pe­ten­cies in bet­ter ev­i­dence­based sto­ry­telling.</p>
    <p>To be held next Mon­day and Tues­day, the in­au­gu­ral sum­mit will fea­ture speak­ers such as Dr Sylvie Briand, di­rec­tor of the Global In­fec­tious Haz­ard Pre­pared­ness de­part­ment; Ms Alyssa Zei­zler, Wall Street Journal’s re­search & de­vel­op­ment chief and prod­uct lead for news­room tools; Mr David Walm­s­ley, editor-in-chief at The Globe and Mail; and The Straits Times’ se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik.</p>
    <p>It will show­case four 90-minute ses­sions which will cover top­ics such as ad­dress­ing fu­ture pan­demics, coun­ter­ing mis­in­for­ma­tion and boosting news­room ex­per­tise de­spite shrink­ing bud­gets.</p>
    <p>Award-win­ning jour­nal­ist Shirish Kulka­rni will also share his re­search on the build­ing blocks for good sto­ry­telling, and the tools that jour­nal­ists can use to de­liver mem­o­rable jour­nal­ism.</p>
    <p>The sum­mit is part of a new Sci­ence In The News­room pro­gramme, held by Wan-Ifra and sup­ported by Te­masek Foun­da­tion, con­sist­ing of high-im­pact work­shop train­ing and shar­ing of best news­room prac­tices.</p>
    <p>It seeks to bridge gaps in spe­cial­ist health and sci­ence re­port­ing skills, teach jour­nal­ists how to bet­ter ad­dress mis­in­for­ma­tion around com­plex is­sues and build greater pub­lic trust in news­rooms.</p>
    <p>Its first run, held in Au­gust and Septem­ber, at­tracted close to 90 jour­nal­ists from Africa, South Asia and Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the eSum­mit, the pro­gramme will also pro­duce a jour­nal­ism hand­book as a ref­er­ence to share with news­rooms world­wide, con­tain­ing key lessons, ac­tion points and re­sources.</p>
    <p>ST editor War­ren Fer­nan­dez, who is also editor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English, Malay and Tamil Me­dia Group and pres­i­dent of the World Ed­i­tors Fo­rum, said that news­rooms are see­ing a spike in read­er­ship as peo­ple look for re­li­able and au­thor­i­ta­tive writ­ers they can trust.</p>
    <p>“To build that trust, we need to have the ex­per­tise on the sub­ject, and the skills and abil­ity to com­mu­ni­cate the com­plex­ity of the med­i­cal and sci­en­tific is­sues in ways that peo­ple can un­der­stand and re­late to.</p>
    <p>“This sum­mit, as well as the train­ing, is de­signed to do that,” said Mr Fer­nan­dez.</p>
