    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Amer­i­can model Chrissy Teigen is back on so­cial me­dia for the first time since her mis­car­riage ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old had not posted any­thing since she dis­closed on Oct 1 that she had lost her baby boy af­ter suf­fer­ing preg­nancy com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The tele­vi­sion per­son­al­ity and cook­book au­thor looked to have perked up over the week­end af­ter she saw a post shared on the In­sta­gram ac­count of Betches Me­dia.</p>
    <p>It quoted user Kara More­hart, who wrote: “Just booked an eye­brow wax­ing ap­point­ment and I’m ex­cited I’ll be wear­ing a mask so I don’t have to hear ‘mous­tache too?’”</p>
    <p>Teigen com­mented: “Fi­nally, a gig­gle. Thank you.”</p>
    <p>Her re­sponse gar­nered many sup­port­ive mes­sages from fans who wished her well.</p>
    <p>Teigen and her hus­band, mu­si­cian John Leg­end, an­nounced in Au­gust they were ex­pect­ing a third child af­ter she de­buted her baby bump at the end of the 41-year-old singer’s mu­sic video for the song Wild.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who mar­ried in 2013, have two chil­dren – daugh­ter, Luna, four, and son, Miles, two.</p>
    <p>Teigen had kept her fans up­dated on her preg­nancy on so­cial me­dia, in­clud­ing on Sept 29, when she was hos­pi­talised due to heavy bleed­ing.</p>
    <p>She shared the dev­as­tat­ing news of her preg­nancy loss two days later on Twit­ter: “Driv­ing home from the hospi­tal with no baby. How can this be real?”</p>
    <p>She fol­lowed it up on In­sta­gram with a longer heart-rend­ing post. She shared pho­tos of her and Leg­end in hospi­tal, in­clud­ing of them hold­ing the child, who had been bun­dled up in a blan­ket.</p>
