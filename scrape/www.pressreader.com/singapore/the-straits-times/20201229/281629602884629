    <p>WASHINGTON Cur­rent and for­mer US health of­fi­cials have taken to the air­waves to warn Amer­i­cans of a po­ten­tial jump in coro­n­avirus cases after the hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>“A surge upon a surge” may be on the way after the Christ­mas and New Year pe­riod, Dr An­thony Fauci, the gov­ern­ment’s top in­fec­tious dis­eases doc­tor, warned on CNN’s State Of The Union pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>For­mer US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion chief Scott Got­tlieb said on CBS’ Face The Na­tion that “we have a grim month ahead of us” after a re­cent in­crease in cases, with hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions ris­ing on a lag of a few weeks.</p>
    <p>The comments on Sun­day came as the num­ber of con­firmed Covid-19 in­fec­tions in the United States sur­passed 19 mil­lion and deaths linked to the dis­ease reached 333,000.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has added an­other one mil­lion new cases in just six days, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci, direc­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases, warned that the US is at a “very crit­i­cal point” in com­bat­ing the pan­demic after many Amer­i­cans ig­nored guid­ance to avoid travel.</p>
    <p>Fly­ing has picked up of late de­spite re­main­ing well be­low lev­els from a year ago. Fig­ures from the Trans­porta­tion Se­cu­rity Ad­min­is­tra­tion show more than one mil­lion peo­ple moved through US airport check­points on five of the past nine days head­ing into and through the hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Ad­mi­ral Brett Giroir, a mem­ber of the White House coro­n­avirus task force, said the risks en­tailed by trav­el­ling de­pend mostly on what peo­ple do once they get to their des­ti­na­tions, as ac­tu­ally be­ing in an air­plane is typ­i­cally safe.</p>
    <p>“What we re­ally worry about is the min­gling of dif­fer­ent bub­bles once you get to your des­ti­na­tion,” Adm Giroir said on Fox News Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Vac­ci­na­tions in the US be­gan on Dec 14 with health­care work­ers and res­i­dents of nurs­ing homes be­ing in­oc­u­lated with Pfizer and BioNTech’s vac­cine.</p>
    <p>So far, al­most two mil­lion vac­cine doses have been ad­min­is­tered in the coun­try, ac­cord­ing to a state-by-state tally com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Those num­bers are ac­cel­er­at­ing as a sec­ond vac­cine by Moderna is be­ing dis­trib­uted, but of­fi­cials say the pace of the roll-out is slip­ping be­hind sched­ule.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials are on alert for a more in­fec­tious strain of the virus that has emerged in Bri­tain, Ger­many, Switzer­land, Ire­land and Ja­pan, though there is no clear ev­i­dence that it results in more se­vere cases of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers ar­riv­ing i n the US from Bri­tain face more re­stric­tions be­cause of the new vari­ant, with the US in­sist­ing on pas­sen­gers test­ing neg­a­tive for Covid-19 within 72 hours of de­par­ture from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Dr Got­tlieb, a board mem­ber of Pfizer, said he be­lieves Bri­tain’s virus strain is al­ready in the US, and in “a rea­son­able num­ber at this point”.</p>
    <p>He saw signs that Amer­ica’s new daily Covid-19 cases were start­ing to plateau, but since hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and fa­tal­i­ties tend to lag by two to three weeks, “we have a very dif­fi­cult month ahead of us”.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has re­mained silent about the new vari­ant and the wors­en­ing crisis grip­ping some parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>He took to Twit­ter last Satur­day to crit­i­cise Demo­cratic gov­er­nors for tak­ing emer­gency steps to con­tain the out­break. “The lock­downs in Demo­crat-run states are ab­so­lutely ru­in­ing the lives of so many peo­ple,” Mr Trump tweeted.</p>
