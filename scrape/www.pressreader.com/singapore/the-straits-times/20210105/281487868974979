    <p>A Pri­mary 1 pupil and his fa­ther hav­ing their tem­per­a­tures taken on the first day of the new school year at Wa­ter­way Pri­mary School in Pung­gol Drive yes­ter­day. Each child was al­lowed to be ac­com­pa­nied by only one par­ent. Mul­ti­ple screen­ing sta­tions were also set up to pre­vent con­ges­tion. Across Sin­ga­pore, around 3,500 Kinder­garten 1 chil­dren and 40,000 Pri­mary 1 pupils started school yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The two stu­dents who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 re­cently are a timely re­minder that pre­cau­tions are still very much nec­es­sary, said Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong yes­ter­day, on the first day of the school year.</p>
    <p>He said clus­ters could have eas­ily emerged had the cases been un­cov­ered dur­ing the school term, cau­tion­ing that safe dis­tanc­ing must still be ob­served even in phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>“Even in phase three, we main­tain all the nec­es­sary safe man­age­ment mea­sures through­out our schools,” said Mr Wong, cit­ing health screen­ing at the gates and the ex­am­i­na­tion-style seat­ing ar­range­ments in class­rooms.</p>
    <p>Two stu­dents from Raf­fles Girls’ School (RGS) had ear­lier tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus. The first was a fam­ily mem­ber of an ear­lier Covid-19 case, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who works as a marine sur­veyor.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond stu­dent had vis­ited the first teen at her home for a few hours on a day that the marine sur­veyor was present.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong was speak­ing dur­ing a me­dia visit to Wa­ter­way Pri­mary School on the first day of school, where The Straits Times ob­served the safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>Only Pri­mary 1 pupils be­gan classes yes­ter­day in pri­mary schools. Kinder­garten 1 (K1) chil­dren from the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion kinder­gartens also at­tended school yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Across Sin­ga­pore, about 3,500 K1 chil­dren and 40,000 Pri­mary 1 pupils went to school yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Kinder­garten 2 and Pri­mary 2 to Pri­mary 6 chil­dren got an ex­tra day of hol­i­day and stayed at home. They start school to­day.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion and sec­ondary schools also re­opened yes­ter­day, while ju­nior col­leges and Mil­len­nia In­sti­tute will do so next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>At Wa­ter­way Pri­mary, pupils and ac­com­pa­ny­ing par­ents had to have their tem­per­a­tures taken be­fore en­ter­ing the school, with mul­ti­ple screen­ing sta­tions set up to pre­vent con­ges­tion. Only one par­ent was al­lowed per child.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers were sta­tioned around the school to di­rect the chil­dren to the gath­er­ing points for their re­spec­tive classes as well.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong said the aim is to “en­sure that we can keep schools open and safe, and that we can keep learn­ing go­ing through­out the school year”.</p>
    <p>“We have al­ready seen a lot of dis­rup­tions in school life in many other coun­tries last year and, even now, con­tin­u­ing in many places where schools re­main closed. We do not want that to hap­pen in Sin­ga­pore and we are de­ter­mined to make sure that our stu­dents can con­tinue to learn, and en­joy learn­ing in our schools in a safe and sus­tain­able man­ner,” he added.</p>
    <p>Wa­ter­way Pri­mary prin­ci­pal Wee-Kwan Liam, 62, said that as only the Pri­mary 1 and K1 chil­dren were at the school yes­ter­day, there was a lot more man­power and teach­ers could help the chil­dren set­tle into their class­rooms. “(What is ad­di­tional) this year is the safety man­age­ment mea­sures, where the ba­sic ap­proach is about per­sonal hy­giene, per­sonal re­spon­si­bil­ity and so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity,” she said.</p>
    <p>Par­ents were also asked to gather in class­rooms to at­tend an in­tro­duc­tion ses­sion by teach­ers and watch a video ad­dress by the prin­ci­pal.</p>
    <p>One par­ent, Mrs Aryany Abdul Manab, 36, said it was good that teach­ers fo­cused on the younger chil­dren on the first day of school.</p>
    <p>“It’s to get them ac­cus­tomed to a dif­fer­ent rou­tine – where to go, what to do... I think it was a good ini­tia­tive,” said Mrs Aryany, a pri­vate pre-school prin­ci­pal, who was with her seven-year-old-son.</p>
    <p>Pri­mary 1 pupil Jaden Heng was ner­vous but ex­cited about the first day of school: “I feel good be­cause I can learn more things. I haven’t made any friends yet but I am ex­cited to meet my class­mates.”</p>
