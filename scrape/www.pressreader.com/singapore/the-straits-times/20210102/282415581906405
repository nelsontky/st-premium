    <p>The Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) will re­view and take nec­es­sary ac­tion if CoAs­sets’ li­censed sub­sidiary – now known as CA Fund­ing – has breached reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>As a mat­ter of pol­icy, MAS does not dis­close its deal­ings with reg­u­lated fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>MAS added that it is aware that police re­ports have been lodged against CoAs­sets. It also clar­i­fied that it does not reg­u­late the group, but only the spe­cific en­tity that is li­censed with MAS.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of CoAs­sets’ re­tail in­vestors were left reel­ing early last month when it came to light that the Sin­ga­pore-based al­ter­na­tive lend­ing plat­form had trans­ferred US$30 mil­lion (S$40 mil­lion) of its bor­row­ings to a lit­tle-known debt recovery firm, Sun­fits, ac­cord­ing to a Tech in Asia re­port.</p>
    <p>Sun­fits wrote in a note to in­vestors that it could not col­lect on the debt as there is no “vis­i­bil­ity” on any of the as­sets. In a sep­a­rate e-mail sent on Mon­day, it was re­vealed that CA Fund­ing is “cur­rently non-op­er­a­tional and in­sol­vent”, with loan recovery “ex­tremely chal­leng­ing”.</p>
    <p>Ag­grieved in­vestors have since filed police re­ports against CoAs­sets co-founders Getty Goh, who was the for­mer group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, and Seh Huan Kiat, and have grouped to­gether on so­cial me­dia chan­nels such as Tele­gram to pur­sue le­gal ac­tion.</p>
    <p>When asked by The Busi­ness Times if the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment was han­dling the mat­ter, the police confirmed only that re­ports had been lodged.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book state­ment that was later taken down, Mr Goh de­nied blame for the fi­asco. He had stepped down as chair­man and group CEO ear­lier last year, but re­mains CEO of the MAS-li­censed CA Fund­ing.</p>
    <p>The chair­man­ship and group CEO posts were taken over by Mr Denka Wee, di­rec­tor of real es­tate bro­ker­age firm DWG. Mr Wee re­signed as CoAs­sets chair­man last month.</p>
    <p>The ear­lier plan was for DWG to ab­sorb CoAs­sets and help in­vestors with an exit, wrote Mr Goh. How­ever, the deal failed to take off, with dif­fer­ing ac­counts of what tran­spired.</p>
    <p>CoAs­sets first started out as a crowd­fund­ing site for real es­tate in 2013, but later em­barked on a dif­fer­ent busi­ness model where it set up sub­sidiaries and is­sued loans known as prom­is­sory notes to in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Prom­is­sory notes are debt in­stru­ments that al­low com­pa­nies to ob­tain fi­nanc­ing from sources other than a bank. As these prom­is­sory notes are higher risk, they are usu­ally of­fered only to cor­po­rate or so­phis­ti­cated in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Amid talk of a po­ten­tial merger with DWG, Mr Goh had con</p>
    <p>vinced in­vestors to stay on board and ex­tend the pay­ment dead­lines for many of the prom­is­sory notes that were set to ma­ture last year, claim­ing that the notes were con­trac­tu­ally guar­an­teed by DWG and Mr Wee. This came as Covid-19 be­came the fi­nal nail in the cof­fin, hit­ting the al­ter­na­tive lend­ing in­dus­try hard and dry­ing up fund­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in­vestors who were count­ing on the guar­an­tee found their hopes dashed when DWG voided the agree­ment, cit­ing “sus­pi­cious ac­tiv­ity” af­ter a re­view of doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail state­ment to Tech in Asia, DWG claimed it had dis­cov­ered “ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties, mis­in­for­ma­tion and sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tions” when it looked into CoAs­sets.</p>
    <p>For­mer CoAs­sets chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Lawrence Lim has gone public to urge af­fected in­vestors to file police re­ports.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Tech in Asia, he raised is­sues with the prom­is­sory notes such as the lack of trans­parency, with funds mostly di­verted to one com­pany that in­vested in projects such as tech start-ups and film pro­duc­tions. They were also not backed by col­lat­eral.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim also alleged that CoAs­sets did not in­form in­vestors that the com­pa­nies in its port­fo­lio had trou­ble re­pay­ing the loans and con­tin­ued to raise funds.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral af­fected in­vestors ex­pressed their frus­tra­tion on so­cial me­dia, al­leg­ing that they were told the prom­is­sory notes were backed with col­lat­eral and per­sonal guar­an­tees.</p>
    <p>Early last year, CoAs­sets told in­vestors it had 17kg of emer­alds worth US$6 mil­lion that could be used as col­lat­eral. But it was re­vealed that the emer­alds were worth only about US$15,000 in an in­de­pen­dent valu­a­tion by Sun­fits.</p>
    <p>Both Sun­fits and DWG are also con­sid­er­ing le­gal ac­tion, ac­cord­ing to Tech in Asia.</p>
    <p>In CoAs­sets’ lat­est an­nual re­port, the com­pany’s rev­enue fell by 250 per cent for the year to June 30, 2020, with US$13.3 mil­lion in as­set im­pair­ments.</p>
    <p>CoAs­sets was pre­vi­ously listed on the Aus­tralian Se­cu­ri­ties Ex­change in 2016, but ap­plied to delist last April, cit­ing a low num­ber of share­hold­ers and low trad­ing vol­ume. It had ear­lier dis­closed in end-2019 that it was be­ing in­spected by MAS, but it is un­clear if any ac­tion was taken in the end.</p>
