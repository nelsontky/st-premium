    <p>The fi­nal two un­de­clared states in the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion have been called by TV net­works – with Demo­crat chal­lenger Joe Bi­den winning the for­mer Repub­li­can strong­hold of Ge­or­gia, and in­cum­bent Don­ald Trump get­ting North Carolina. The lat­est tal­lies gave Mr Bi­den a solid over­all win of 306 against 232.</p>
    <p>REHOBOTH BEACH/WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has fur­ther so­lid­i­fied his elec­tion vic­tory by winning the state of Ge­or­gia, leav­ing Mr Don­ald Trump lit­tle hope of re­vers­ing the out­come through le­gal chal­lenges and re­counts.</p>
    <p>Edi­son Re­search, which made the Ge­or­gia call, also pro­jected that North Carolina, the only other bat­tle­ground state with an out­stand­ing vote count, would go to Pres­i­dent Trump, fi­nal­is­ing the elec­toral vote tally at 306 for Mr Bi­den to 232 for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>The numbers gave Mr Bi­den, a Demo­crat, a re­sound­ing vic­tory over Mr Trump in the Elec­toral Col­lege, equal to the 306 votes that Mr Trump, a Repub­li­can, se­cured to de­feat Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton in a 2016 win that Mr Trump had called a “land­slide”.</p>
    <p>Al­though the na­tional pop­u­lar vote does not de­ter­mine the elec­tion out­come, Mr Bi­den was ahead by more than 5.3 mil­lion votes, or 3.4 per­cent­age points.</p>
    <p>His share of the pop­u­lar vote, at 50.8 per cent, was slightly higher than Mr Ron­ald Rea­gan’s share of the vote in 1980 when Mr Rea­gan de­feated Mr Jimmy Carter.</p>
    <p>To win a sec­ond term, Mr Trump would need to over­turn Mr Bi­den’s lead in at least three states, but he has so far failed to pro­duce ev­i­dence that he could do so in any of them.</p>
    <p>States face a Dec 8 “safe har­bour” dead­line to cer­tify their elec­tions and choose elec­tors for the Elec­toral Col­lege, which will of­fi­cially se­lect the new pres­i­dent on Dec 14.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Bi­den’s team is press­ing ahead with the tran­si­tion, iden­ti­fy­ing leg­isla­tive pri­or­i­ties, re­view­ing fed­eral agency poli­cies and pre­par­ing to fill thou­sands of jobs in the new ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>This comes de­spite Mr Trump’s re­fusal to con­cede the Nov 3 elec­tion, which ma­jor news or­gan­i­sa­tions called for Mr Bi­den on Nov 7.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect will be briefed by his own na­tional se­cu­rity ex­perts this week, his tran­si­tion of­fi­cial Jen Psaki said on Friday. There are con­cerns that be­ing out of the loop be­cause of de­lays to the tran­si­tion could be a na­tional se­cu­rity risk.</p>
    <p>“We’re charg­ing ahead with the tran­si­tion,” Ms Psaki said on a con­fer­ence call while stress­ing that Mr Bi­den still needs “real-time in­for­ma­tion” from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to deal with the resur­gent coro­n­avirus pandemic and na­tional se­cu­rity threats.</p>
    <p>“With ev­ery day that passes on, it be­comes more con­cern­ing that our na­tional se­cu­rity team and the Pres­i­dent-elect and the Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect don’t have ac­cess to those threat as­sess­ments, in­tel­li­gence brief­ings, real-time in­for­ma­tion about our en­gage­ments around the world,” Ms Psaki said.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause, you know, you don’t know what you don’t know.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who has promised to pick a di­verse Cab­i­net, is re­port­edly con­sid­er­ing for­mer Fed­eral Re­serve chair Janet Yellen to be his Trea­sury sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>Dr Yellen has with­drawn from at least one up­com­ing speak­ing en­gage­ment be­cause she is now in con­tention for Trea­sury sec­re­tary, one of the peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said. The peo­ple spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den team is also eye­ing Fed gov­er­nor Lael Brainard and for­mer Fed vice-chair Roger Fer­gu­son for the job, Bloomberg News re­ported in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Dr Yellen is a dis­tin­guished fel­low in res­i­dence at the Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Bi­den tran­si­tion team said it was not mak­ing any new per­son­nel de­ci­sions yet.</p>
