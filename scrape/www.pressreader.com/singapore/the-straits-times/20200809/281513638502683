    <p>Ms Grace Sai was ner­vous as she walked to­wards the Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms counter at the Wood­lands check­point.</p>
    <p>Please, please don’t make me open my suit­case, she prayed silently.</p>
    <p>“But of course, I kena,” she says, dra­mat­i­cally flip­ping her palms up­wards and laps­ing into Singlish to em­pha­sise how her worst fear came true.</p>
    <p>The Cus­toms of­fi­cer stared at the 30 fruit­cakes in her suit­case. “Is there a war in Sin­ga­pore? Are you go­ing to feed the whole coun­try?” he asked.</p>
    <p>The cakes, she replied fee­bly, were baked by her mother in Ipoh so that she could sell them and raise money for her start-up.</p>
    <p>He asked: “What is a start-up?” To her re­lief, he let her through. Over the next few days, she sold the cakes at $100 each to friends and con­tacts.</p>
    <p>The $3,000 she raised al­lowed her to hang on, for two more months, to a dream she hoped to re­alise: launch­ing The Hub, one of Sin­ga­pore’s first co-work­ing start-ups.</p>
    <p>Time was run­ning out for the Ipoh-born en­tre­pre­neur, then 28, who had al­ready busted the sev­en­month dead­line she had given her­self to make the con­cept fly.</p>
    <p>“But in those two months, ev­ery­thing hap­pened. And ev­ery­thing changed,” she says, eyes crin­kling.</p>
    <p>She got a seed round and found a build­ing off Or­chard Road. The Hub took off like a house on fire, with mem­ber­ship in­creas­ing more than ten-fold to more than 300 in barely a year.</p>
    <p>Sought af­ter by gov­ern­ment think-tanks and hailed as a start-up pioneer and builder of in­no­va­tion ecosys­tems, she was soon giv­ing TED talks and fly­ing all over the world to give pre­sen­ta­tions to the likes of Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel.</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward eight years.</p>
    <p>Ms Sai – now the mother of a year-old tod­dler – is co-founder of Found8 which made head­lines a year ago when it raised US$20 mil­lion (S$27 mil­lion) to de­velop cowork­ing spa­ces in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>With five lo­ca­tions in Sin­ga­pore and one in Malaysia, the out­fit has about 1,000 mem­bers who can tap a net­work com­pris­ing in­vestors, men­tors, in­no­va­tion ex­perts and pro­fes­sional ser­vices firms. As it is Google for Star­tups’ first South-east Asia part­ner, mem­bers get ac­cess to a suite of perks, philoso­phies and com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>At a con­fer­ence room in the cheer­ily ap­pointed Found8 space i n Amoy Street, the chatty Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent sits, re­count­ing the many de­tours she has nav­i­gated in her life.</p>
    <p>She grew up in Ipoh, the fifth of six chil­dren of a sec­ondary school as­sis­tant head­mas­ter and a kinder­garten prin­ci­pal.</p>
    <p>“They were pro­gres­sive. They never asked us to study but en­cour­aged us to be in­quis­i­tive and find things out for our­selves,” says Ms Sai, who re­mem­bers turn­ing the house into a theme park with her sib­lings and charg­ing their friends for dif­fer­ent “at­trac­tions”.</p>
    <p>Ex­tremely com­pet­i­tive, the straight As stu­dent at Methodist Girls School was a high-flier.</p>
    <p>“I was pres­i­dent of three clubs, con­ducted the choir and was a state de­bater,” says Ms Sai, who har­boured dreams of be­com­ing a “love doc­tor” solv­ing the ro­man­tic en­tan­gle­ments of lis­ten­ers on ra­dio.</p>
    <p>Her ster­ling SPM re­sults – the Malaysian equiv­a­lent of the O lev­els – won her an Asean schol­ar­ship to study at St An­drew’s Ju­nior Col­lege in Sin­ga­pore in 2000.</p>
    <p>“The let­ter came on Christ­mas Eve but I hid it from my par­ents be­cause I didn’t want to come. I thought I wanted a sim­ple life. But my brother pecah lobang,” she says, us­ing the Malay term for spilling the beans.</p>
    <p>A few days later, she found her­self on the bus cry­ing all the way from Ipoh to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Once here, she found her groove quickly and went on to study busi­ness at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Uni­ver­sity (NTU). A turn­ing point came when NTU mar­ket­ing pro­fes­sor Hooi Den Huan ap­proached her to write case stud­ies for Re­think­ing Mar­ket­ing (2003), a book he co-au­thored with Amer­i­can mar­ket­ing au­thor­ity Philip Kotler and In­done­sian mar­ket­ing ex­pert Her­mawan Kar­ta­jaya.</p>
    <p>“Some­one told him I could speak and write in many lan­guages,” says Ms Sai, who is flu­ent in English, French, Ger­man, Malay, In­done­sian and sev­eral Chi­nese di­alects.</p>
    <p>The au­thors were so pleased with her work that Mr Kar­ta­jaya of­fered her a job as his ex­ec­u­tive as­sis­tant in MarkPlus Inc, the largest mar­ket­ing con­sul­tancy in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>In 2006, she packed her bags for Jakarta.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to know the real world and find the path my­self,” she says.</p>
    <p>Mr Kar­ta­jaya wears mul­ti­ple hats, one of which was con­sul­tant to former In­done­sian pres­i­dent Susilo Bam­bang Yud­hoy­ono.</p>
    <p>“I met SBY,” she says, us­ing the acro­nym he is known by, “in the first week I was there. And I also got a chance to work with (au­thor) Kotler. That’s when my global ex­po­sure be­gan.”</p>
    <p>A year later, her sis­ter asked her to set up a telco com­pany in Jakarta. Win­ning telco con­tracts and build­ing telco tow­ers, she says, in­volved deal­ing with all sorts of peo­ple, some of whom were shady.</p>
    <p>But she coped well, thanks to her one year at MarkPlus where she not only cul­ti­vated an in­valu­able net­work of con­tacts but also de­vel­oped some en­tre­pre­neur­ial smarts.</p>
    <p>“It made me re­alise hav­ing a set of strong val­ues and prin­ci­ples is im­por­tant be­cause it’s very easy to get dodgy. I did it my way and pro­duced re­sults,” she says proudly.</p>
    <p>Money, she re­alised, is not hard to make.</p>
    <p>“But it wasn’t nec­es­sar­ily mean­ing­ful just mak­ing a busi­ness work be­cause it wasn’t pur­pose-led.”</p>
    <p>It led, she says with a laugh, to a “quar­ter-life cri­sis”. Then she had a strange dream in­volv­ing a build­ing with a basketball court and 342 rooms for home­less chil­dren to study in.</p>
    <p>“It was so vivid that I just drew it out when I woke up. I also had a feel­ing that it was some­thing I had to do.”</p>
    <p>She spoke to her late fa­ther, who told her to fo­cus on build­ing her ca­reer and do good later in life. Be­cause she stub­bornly ig­nored his ad­vice, fa­ther and daugh­ter did not speak for six months.</p>
    <p>In­spired by Mr John Woods, the Mi­crosoft ex­ec­u­tive who left the com­puter gi­ant to set up the non­profit Room To Read, Ms Sai de­cided to launch Books For Hope by build­ing li­braries in re­mote com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>She wrote an e-mail to her net­work of friends and con­tacts, chron­i­cling her dream and de­tail­ing ways peo­ple could help.</p>
    <p>“In three weeks, I had about 4,000 books in my apart­ment,” says Ms Sai, who would trudge off into re­mote vil­lages on week­ends with books, build­ing ma­te­ri­als and an army of vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>In just two years, Books For Hope set up 29 li­braries, stock­ing them with more than 30,000 books.</p>
    <p>Her work was a game changer in more ways than one. It led to her nab­bing a Skoll Schol­ar­ship – from e-Bay founder Jeff Skoll – to do an MBA for so­cial en­trepreneur­s at Ox­ford Uni­ver­sity in 2009.</p>
    <p>“My one year in Ox­ford was amaz­ing. The school stood for some­thing, groom­ing a new gen­er­a­tion of busi­ness lead­ers who did not de­stroy the world but i mproved lives,” says Ms Sai, whose class­mates in­cluded the Wrin­klevoss twins, tech­preneurs who fa­mously sued Face­book founder Mark Zucker­berg for steal­ing their Con­nectU idea to cre­ate Face­book in 2004.</p>
    <p>She met tons of in­ter­est­ing peo­ple in­clud­ing TED founder Chris Talk and singer An­nie Len­nox, who founded The Cir­cle, an NGO to cham­pion women’s rights. One night, she even found her­self sit­ting next to her hero, Mr Woods, at din­ner.</p>
    <p>Ms Sai grad­u­ated with dis­tinc­tion in 2010.</p>
    <p>“It was my thing. I found my tribe and I felt that the world was my oys­ter. You know, peo­ple who chart their own paths are su­per lonely be­cause they’ve got to deal with naysay­ers so you need to form a com­mu­nity which sup­ports you.”</p>
    <p>As part of her course, she had a stint in Sil­i­con Val­ley where she chanced upon The Hub and fell in love with the co-work­ing con­cept, where dif­fer­ent en­ter­prises – from Web devel­op­ers to so­cial en­trepreneur­s – come to­gether to solve prob­lems through the cre­ative process.</p>
    <p>Although she could have worked in San Francisco or Lon­don, she de­cided to come back to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“I felt I could be more pur­pose­ful in this re­gion. This is a blue ocean, com­pletely ripe for new busi­ness mod­els,” she says.</p>
    <p>She poured $30,000 – her sav­ings from her MBA schol­ar­ship – to start The Hub, later re­named Im­pact Hub.</p>
    <p>“I told my­self I could last for seven months with­out a salary,” says Ms Sai, who moved into an apart­ment in the red-light dis­trict of Gey­lang to save money.</p>
    <p>Seven months came and went. Although she had noth­ing to show for it, she re­fused to give up. So she took a bus and high­tailed it to her par­ents’ home in Ipoh, bought fruit and nuts and got her mother to bake her 30 of her fa­mous fruit­cakes.</p>
    <p>The rest is start-up his­tory.</p>
    <p>“The space was like a mini-United Na­tions. At one stage, we had 55 na­tion­al­i­ties there. Golden Gate Ven­tures, Tech In Asia and sev­eral other well-known names today all started out there,” she says, adding that the likes of Mr Toivo An­nus (co-founder of Skype) also hung out in the space.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ms Sai, who started a cor­po­rate in­no­va­tion prac­tice, con­tin­ued beef­ing up her CV. She ob­tained an ex­ec­u­tive mas­ter’s in coach­ing and con­sult­ing for change from Insead and also com­pleted a fel­low­ship with Kauff­man Fel­lows, a lead­er­ship or­gan­i­sa­tion in in­no­va­tion and cap­i­tal for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>In 2017, she left the Im­pact Hub net­work to start Found.</p>
    <p>“At that time, the ecosys­tem here was grow­ing very quickly. There was a need for in­ter­me­di­aries like us to also serve the wider tech ecosys­tem,” she says.</p>
    <p>Last year, she joined forces with Ms Michelle Yong from com­peti­tor Col­li­son8 to found Found8. She fo­cuses on cor­po­rate in­no­va­tion while Ms Yong takes care of re­gional ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>Asked how badly im­pacted the busi­ness is by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, she says safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures have halved her in­ven­tory.</p>
    <p>But Ms Sai, who is mar­ried to the head hon­cho of an in­surtech startup, is not wor­ried.</p>
    <p>“There are t wo schools of thought. One be­lieves the fu­ture is work from home. An­other be­lieves that cor­po­rates will let go of their long-term leases to come into more flex­i­ble op­tions like ours. Whether the at­tri­tion can be re­placed by an in­flux of cus­tomer pro­file re­mains to be seen,” she says.</p>
    <p>The up­side from the pan­demic? The cor­po­rate in­no­va­tion part of the busi­ness which she heads is win­ning deal af­ter deal. “We’ve had a record quar­ter be­cause com­pa­nies now see the im­por­tance of change and in­no­va­tion.”</p>
    <p>While de­struc­tive, she says the pan­demic has a re­flec­tive el­e­ment.</p>
    <p>“It strips away all noise and calls for us to re­turn to our pur­pose, why we started in the first place. It’s a chance for com­pa­nies that have over­spent, over-hired and are over­hyped to come back to ba­sics.</p>
    <p>“It’s also a great op­por­tu­nity for us to re­think how busi­ness can be used for so­ci­etal good.”</p>
