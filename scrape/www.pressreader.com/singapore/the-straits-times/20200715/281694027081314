    <p>The Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) has cho­sen as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Leong Mun Wai, 60, and vice-chair­man Hazel Poa, 49, to fill the two Non-Con­stituency MP (NCMP) po­si­tions it se­cured at the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Party chief Tan Cheng Bock, 80, an­nounced the choice of the two NCMPs at a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, in what is a likely sig­nal of who the party has cho­sen to lead its re­newal.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, who has of­ten spo­ken about the need for the party to go be­yond him, pre­vi­ously ruled him­self out of the seat, say­ing that he has been an MP be­fore and would rather have his team­mates gain some par­lia­men­tary ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong and Ms Poa were on the party’s West Coast GRC slate, which se­cured 48.31 per cent of the votes against the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party team led by Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran, emerg­ing as the best losers in the July 10 polls.</p>
    <p>Both NCMP nom­i­nees had said they had reser­va­tions about the scheme, but said yes­ter­day that they un­der­stood the de­ci­sion made by the party.</p>
    <p>On the cam­paign trail a week ear­lier, Mr Leong said he would not be keen on tak­ing up an NCMP po­si­tion if he was of­fered it, adding: “If you use the NCMP (po­si­tion), you are re­garded as a loser MP, and you have no ac­cess to the peo­ple. The peo­ple are the ones we want to serve.”</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing those re­marks yes­ter­day, Mr Leong said: “I had some per­sonal ob­jec­tions to the scheme. Nev­er­the­less, I’m hum­bled by the trust the party has placed in me to take up this NCMP (po­si­tion). And very im­por­tantly, the party needs to... rep­re­sent the 48.5 per cent of vot­ers who voted for us, and also all the Sin­ga­pore­ans that cheered us in this elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ms Poa sim­i­larly said be­com­ing NCMPs would help them rep­re­sent the views of vot­ers who sup­ported them in the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“I feel that this is an op­por­tu­nity for us to bring their voices into Par­lia­ment, so we will want to, over the next five years, con­tinue to en­gage West Coast res­i­dents to find out (their views) in more de­tail, be­cause we ac­tu­ally haven’t had much time be­fore this,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the press con­fer­ence, the two – who apart from Dr Tan were the high­est-rank­ing party mem­bers in the West Coast GRC team – were widely ex­pected to be the ones nom­i­nated to take up the NCMP seats.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said the de­ci­sion was made af­ter an in­ter­nal dis­cus­sion by the</p>
    <p>West Coast GRC team, be­fore be­ing con­firmed by the party’s cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>“So amongst them­selves, they think that they are the bet­ter (choices). They feel that they can per­form bet­ter than the oth­ers,” said Dr Tan, not­ing that he felt the other two mem­bers, Mr Jeffrey Khoo and Mr Nadara­jah Lo­ganathan, were also ca­pa­ble.</p>
    <p>He said the con­sid­er­a­tions in­cluded how the can­di­dates per­formed dur­ing the party’s we­bi­nars and its out­reach on the ground. He added that both of them are also bilin­gual, which helps the party take its mes­sage to those who do not speak English.</p>
    <p>Ms Poa en­tered pol­i­tics in 2010 with the Re­form Party, and switched to the Na­tional Sol­i­dar­ity Party (NSP) ahead of the 2011 elec­tion where she was part of the team con­test­ing in Chua Chu Kang GRC. She sub­se­quently rose to be­come NSP chief but re­signed be­fore the 2015 elec­tion due to a dis­agree­ment. Ms Poa was a found­ing mem­ber of the PSP when it was set up last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong, re­garded as Dr Tan’s right-hand man in the party, was a new face at this elec­tion. He had pre­vi­ously been man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of OCBC Se­cu­ri­ties.</p>
    <p>Both Mr Leong and Ms Poa are for­mer gov­ern­ment schol­ar­ship hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The NCMP scheme cur­rently pro­vides for at least 12 op­po­si­tion Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment. With the Work­ers’ Party (WP) hav­ing 10 elected MPs, the duo from PSP will be the only NCMPs in the next Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said the PSP NCMPs will sup­port WP chief Pri­tam Singh who is also set to be ap­pointed Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, the first time such a po­si­tion has been for­malised.</p>
    <p>“Our two friends here will also ac­cept him as the leader, and we will go along with him,” said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>He stressed, how­ever, that the PSP will not be con­fronta­tional in its ap­proach in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“We want to be sure that the de­bate gets good re­sults for Sin­ga­pore, be­cause it’s this ex­change of ideas that is go­ing on in the House that will get a bet­ter out­come of what­ever poli­cies,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mov­ing for­ward, Dr Tan said the party will con­tinue reach­ing out to Sin­ga­pore­ans, such as start­ing branches in each of the wards in con­stituen­cies, so it can es­tab­lish a pres­ence and be pre­pared when the next elec­tion comes.</p>
    <p>“Over the next five years, we are two-pronged. In Par­lia­ment, they will bring up is­sues that we find on the ground. And on the ground, my­self and my whole team will be comb­ing the ground. So we should be very ready in five years’ time.”</p>
    <p>Progress Sin­ga­pore Party’s vice-chair­man Hazel Poa and as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Leong Mun Wai at yes­ter­day’s press con­fer­ence. Both were on the party’s West Coast GRC slate, which se­cured 48.31 per cent of the votes against the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party team in the July 10 elec­tion.</p>
