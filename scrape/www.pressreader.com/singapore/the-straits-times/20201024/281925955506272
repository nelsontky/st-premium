    <p>Public con­cern over the safety of flu shots has grown in South Korea as the au­thor­i­ties re­ported 36 cases of death af­ter vac­ci­na­tion as at 1pm yes­ter­day, putting strain on ef­forts to curb a po­ten­tial “twindemic” of win­ter flu and the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is still grap­pling with Covid-19, re­port­ing 155 cases yes­ter­day – the high­est since Sept 11 and the se­cond day in a row with case num­bers in the triple dig­its.</p>
    <p>This brings the to­tal to 25,698.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties now also have to tackle a deep­en­ing fear of the state-ad­min­is­tered free flu vac­cine pro­gramme af­ter two batches of vac­cine were found faulty.</p>
    <p>South Korea hopes to in­oc­u­late some 19 mil­lion peo­ple for free, es­pe­cially vul­ner­a­ble groups such as young chil­dren and the el­derly, ahead of the an­nual flu sea­son next month, when tem­per­a­tures drop.</p>
    <p>No causal link has been found yet be­tween the flu shots and the fa­tal­i­ties so far, and in­ves­ti­ga­tions are un­der way to de­ter­mine the ex­act cause of the deaths.</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­known how a 17-year-old liv­ing in In­cheon, the first case, died on Oct 16, two days af­ter get­ting a free flu shot.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s foren­sic agency said it has found no di­rect link be­tween his death and the flu shot.</p>
    <p>But the num­ber of sim­i­lar deaths has since spiked, with 18 alone re­ported on Thurs­day. Most of the deaths in­volved el­derly peo­ple with un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>A woman in her 80s liv­ing in the south­ern port city of Bu­san died yes­ter­day af­ter be­ing taken to the hos­pi­tal for breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties. She had been given a flu shot at an­other hos­pi­tal four days ago.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said she prob­a­bly died of car­dio­vas­cu­lar is­sues, but an au­topsy will be per­formed to con­firm if her death is re­lated to the flu shot.</p>
    <p>Seoul has re­ported at least four such deaths, in­clud­ing a 53-year-old woman who de­vel­oped breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties and died on Wed­nes­day, four days af­ter get­ting vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion Agency (KDCA), vac­cines man­u­fac­tured by at least six of 10 com­pa­nies en­rolled in the gov­ern­ment pro­gramme are linked to such deaths – SK Bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, Shin­sung Pharm, Korea Vac­cine, Bo­ryung Pharm, LG Chem and GC Pharma.</p>
    <p>Two batches of flu vac­cine have been found faulty – one by Shin­sung Pharm that was wrongly stored at room tem­per­a­ture last month in­stead of be­ing re­frig­er­ated, the other by Korea Vac­cine that was found to con­tain white par­ti­cles ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The news sent jit­ters across the coun­try, putting an end to queues for vac­ci­na­tions. Still, the health au­thor­i­ties are push­ing ahead with the na­tion­wide vac­cine pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>KDCA commission­er Jeong Eunkyeong said at a Par­lia­ment hear­ing on Thurs­day that ex­perts agreed “the deaths do not ap­pear to be caused by vac­cine prod­ucts or is­sues with tox­i­c­ity”.</p>
    <p>She added that an inquiry into a pos­si­ble causal re­la­tion­ship will take at least two weeks.</p>
    <p>The Korean Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion has rec­om­mended post­pon­ing the vac­cine pro­gramme for a week while await­ing the probe’s re­sults.</p>
    <p>As at Sun­day, 9.55 mil­lion peo­ple have re­ceived flu shots, ac­cord­ing to the KDCA. About half were spon­sored by the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Teacher Park My­ong-sook, 58, is wor­ried about pos­si­ble side ef­fects af­ter get­ting her flu shot.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple get flu shots to live, but it is now killing us,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
