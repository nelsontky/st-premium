    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land be­gan le­gal ac­tion yes­ter­day against Face­book and Twit­ter for ig­nor­ing re­quests to take down con­tent, in its first such move against ma­jor In­ter­net firms.</p>
    <p>The Dig­i­tal Min­istry filed le­gal com­plaints with the cy­ber­crime po­lice af­ter the two so­cial me­dia gi­ants missed 15-day dead­lines to com­ply fully with court-is­sued take­down or­ders from Aug 27, said Min­is­ter of Dig­i­tal Econ­omy and So­ci­ety Put­tipong Pun­nakanta.</p>
    <p>No ac­tion was taken against Al­pha­bet’s Google as orig­i­nally sug­gested as it took down all the YouTube videos spec­i­fied in the or­der late on Wed­nes­day, Mr Put­tipong said.</p>
    <p>“This is the first time we’re us­ing the Computer Crime Act to take ac­tion against plat­forms for not com­ply­ing with court or­ders,” the min­is­ter told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“Un­less the com­pa­nies send their rep­re­sen­ta­tives to ne­go­ti­ate, po­lice can bring crim­i­nal cases against them. But if they do, and ac­knowl­edge the wrong­do­ing, we can set­tle on fines.”</p>
    <p>Mr Put­tipong did not dis­close de­tails of the con­tent or say what laws had been vi­o­lated.</p>
    <p>The com­plaints were against the United States par­ent com­pa­nies and not their Thai sub­sidiaries, he said.</p>
    <p>The min­istry will file more such take­down re­quests to Face­book, Twit­ter and Google, ask­ing them to re­move more than 3,000 items from their plat­forms – with con­tent rang­ing from pornog­ra­phy to crit­i­cism of the monar­chy, Mr Put­tipong said.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter de­clined to com­ment, while Face­book and Google did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Thai­land has a tough lese ma­jeste law that pro­hibits in­sult­ing the monar­chy. The Computer Crime Act, which out­laws the up­load­ing of in­for­ma­tion that is false or af­fects na­tional se­cu­rity, has also been used to pros­e­cute on­line crit­i­cism of the royal fam­ily.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, the au­thor­i­ties have filed court or­ders with re­quests to so­cial me­dia plat­forms to restrict or re­move per­ceived royal in­sults and other il­le­gal con­tent such as those re­lated to gam­bling or copy­right vi­o­la­tions.</p>
