    <p>LON­DON • Eng­lish ac­tor Jeremy Bul­loch, who played i nfa­mous bounty hunter Boba Fett in the orig­i­nal Star Wars films, has died at the age of 75.</p>
    <p>Bul­loch died on Thurs­day i n hos­pi­tal in Toot­ing, south Lon­don, “fol­low­ing health com­pli­ca­tions, in­clud­ing sev­eral years liv­ing with Parkin­son’s disease”, his web­site said.</p>
    <p>“Jeremy had a long and happy life as an ac­tor and was best known for his roles in the films Sum­mer Hol­i­day, Star Wars and James Bond,” it added.</p>
    <p>Born i n Mar­ket Har­bor­ough, Le­ices­ter­shire, Bul­loch ap­peared in clas­sic tele­vi­sion shows of the 1970s and 1980s – in­clud­ing Doc­tor Who and Robin Of Sher­wood – and had sup­port­ing roles in three James Bond movies.</p>
    <p>But he is best known for play­ing fan favourite Star Wars char­ac­ter Boba Fett in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The Re­turn Of The Jedi (1983).</p>
    <p>He landed the role af­ter a call from his half-brother Robert Watts, who was an as­so­ciate pro­ducer on The Empire Strikes Back.</p>
    <p>“I’d never man­aged to give Jeremy a job on film,” Watts said in 2008, ac­cord­ing to StarWars.com. “So I rang him up and said, ‘If the suit fits, the part’s yours.’ He came in and it fit.”</p>
    <p>His “un­for­get­table per­for­mance as no­to­ri­ous bounty hunter Boba Fett has cap­ti­vated au­di­ences since he first ap­peared”, the of­fi­cial Star Wars Twit­ter ac­count said.</p>
    <p>“He will be re­mem­bered not only for his i conic por­trayal of the leg­endary char­ac­ter, but also for his warmth and gen­er­ous spirit which have be­come an en­dur­ing part of his rich legacy,” it added.</p>
    <p>Bul­loch’s fel­low Star Wars ac­tors paid him trib­ute on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“Jeremy Bul­loch was the quin­tes­sen­tial Eng­lish gen­tle­man,” Mark Hamill, who played Luke Sky­walker, said on Twit­ter. “A fine ac­tor, de­light­ful com­pany and so kind to ev­ery­one lucky enough to meet or work with him. I will deeply miss him and am so grate­ful to have known him.”</p>
    <p>Billy Dee Wil­liams, who played Lando Cal­ris­sian, tweeted: “To­day, we lost the best bounty hunter in the galaxy... RIP Jeremy Bul­loch.”</p>
    <p>Although Boba Fett was a rel­a­tively mi­nor char­ac­ter in the films, he was a favourite with fans and is cur­rently played by New Zealand ac­tor Te­muera Mor­ri­son in the pop­u­lar tele­vi­sion se­ries The Mandaloria­n (2019 to present).</p>
    <p>In 2018, Bul­loch wrote a note of thanks to fans and said he had de­cided to stop at­tend­ing con­ven­tions and “hang up the Fett hel­met”.</p>
    <p>“In 1979, I was called onto the set of Empire Strikes Back to play Boba Fett and, since that day, it has changed the en­tire direction of my life in such a won­der­ful way,” he wrote on his web­site.</p>
    <p>“It has been a priv­i­lege to have had the op­por­tu­nity to in­spire so many gen­er­a­tions of Star Wars fans. Thank you all so much and we will miss you all. May the Force be with you al­ways.”</p>
    <p>Bul­loch is sur­vived by his wife Mau­reen, three sons and 10 grand­chil­dren.</p>
