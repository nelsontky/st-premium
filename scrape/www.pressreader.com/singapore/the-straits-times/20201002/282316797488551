    <p>OR­LANDO • Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver sounded an op­ti­mistic tone when dis­cussing the pos­si­ble re­turn of fans next sea­son, with the caveat that a vac­cine might be nec­es­sary to fill are­nas to ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on Wed­nes­day from Or­lando to re­porters at his an­nual press con­fer­ence be­fore Game 1 of the NBA Fi­nals, he spoke of his hopes that NBA games could again in­clude spec­ta­tors – in par­tially stocked seats at a min­i­mum.</p>
    <p>“With ap­pro­pri­ate pro­to­cols in terms of dis­tanc­ing, and ad­vanced test­ing, you will be able to bring fans back into are­nas,” Sil­ver said.</p>
    <p>“It’s cer­tainly our goal. But it’s de­pen­dent on some ad­di­tional ad­vance­ments. Based on every­thing I’ve read there’s ab­so­lutely no chance that there will be a vac­cine that is widely dis­trib­uted be­fore next sea­son. Rapid test­ing may be the key here.”</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to his de­sire to see happy cus­tomers watch­ing basketball again next year, Sil­ver and NBA own­ers have prag­matic cause for bring­ing a live au­di­ence back: Money.</p>
    <p>Some re­ported es­ti­mates be­lieve ap­prox­i­mately 40 per cent of league prof­its comes from all the rev­enue streams flow­ing when fans at­tend games, from tick­ets, con­ces­sions, park­ing and mer­chan­dise sales. But Sil­ver con­tin­ued to re­main non-com­mit­tal whether fans will re­turn next sea­son, or if the league will again be forced to con­duct a reg­u­lar sea­son in a bub­ble set-up. He said the bub­ble for­mat re­mained a pos­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“It’s some­thing we’re go­ing to have to con­tinue look­ing at,” he added.</p>
    <p>Whether or not fans are al­lowed to re­turn next sea­son, sev­eral other is­sues will need to be worked out, start­ing with when that sea­son will ac­tu­ally start.</p>
    <p>Sil­ver again men­tioned he is look­ing to ei­ther De­cem­ber or Jan­uary as pos­si­ble win­dows to be­gin next sea­son, but he is first hold­ing out for more sci­en­tific as­sur­ances that all in­volved can re­main safe and re­spon­si­ble no mat­ter which plan the league utilises.</p>
    <p>Another ma­jor item to tackle in­volves labour de­tails. Many ba­sic league de­tails for a 2020-21 sea­son are up in the air, in­clud­ing when free agency will be­gin or even what the salary cap will be.</p>
    <p>But Sil­ver does not an­tic­i­pate rugged bar­gain­ing ses­sions in this un­cer­tain en­vi­ron­ment be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I don’t have ex­pec­ta­tions of labour is­sues... there’s no doubt there are is­sues on the ta­ble that have to be ne­go­ti­ated,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I think while no doubt there will be is­sues and dif­fi­cult ne­go­ti­a­tions ahead, I think we’ll work them out as we al­ways have.”</p>
