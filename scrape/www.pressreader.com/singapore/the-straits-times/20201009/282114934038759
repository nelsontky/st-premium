    <p>In the case of the Yishun death, it was re­ported that the attacker and his step­fa­ther had taken mat­ters into their own hands in 2016 af­ter the vic­tim per­sisted in vis­it­ing their flat even af­ter the fam­ily lodged more than 50 po­lice re­ports against him (Yishun death: Jail for attacker and his step­fa­ther, Oct 6).</p>
    <p>It seems strange that de­spite them re­port­ing the in­ci­dents of stalk­ing and ha­rass­ment to the po­lice, they still took mat­ters into their own hands in the end. Does it make sense then to report such cases to the po­lice?</p>
    <p>It was re­ported that the po­lice had sug­gested to the ag­grieved fam­ily to make a mag­is­trate’s com­plaint so that a me­di­a­tion process could then be put in place.</p>
    <p>While I have ev­ery sym­pa­thy for the vic­tim’s fam­ily, I think the broader ques­tion we need to ask is: How does one ob­tain re­dress when such in­tru­sion goes on for a pro­longed pe­riod caus­ing dis­tress, fear and ten­sion to a fam­ily?</p>
    <p>Do the po­lice not have the ca­pac­ity to han­dle such cases? De­spite the nu­mer­ous po­lice re­ports, lit­tle help seemed to have been forth­com­ing to re­solve the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Per­haps, there should be an in­de­pen­dent au­dit of how such com­plaint cases are han­dled by the po­lice, not un­like the Au­di­tor-Gen­eral’s re­view of gov­ern­ment agen­cies. Any gaps in pro­ce­dure should un­dergo a root-cause analysis with ac­tion­able con­se­quences.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, any­one in a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion will not see a need to report the mat­ter to the po­lice.</p>
