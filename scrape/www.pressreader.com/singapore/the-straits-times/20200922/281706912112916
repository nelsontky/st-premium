    <p>Most peo­ple would think twice about hav­ing some­thing in­serted into their nose or throat, which could ex­plain why some say no to be­ing swabbed for Covid-19 tests if given a choice. Ti­mothy Goh - who has a strong dis­like for such pro­ce­dures - finds out first-hand what swab­bing pro­ce­dures feel like.</p>
    <p>TEST 1 Na­sopha­ryn­geal swab (con­ducted by SwabBot)</p>
    <p>A ro­tat­ing swab is in­serted through the nos­tril to the back of the nasal cav­ity by a spe­cially de­signed ro­bot.</p>
    <p>This was the test I was most ner­vous about, as it was done by a ro­bot. Lean­ing close to the ma­chine in a seated po­si­tion, I braced my­self for a burst of pain. In­stead, the feel­ing was sim­i­lar to when wa­ter got into my nose while swim­ming. It smarted a lit­tle, but the ma­chine was in­cred­i­bly gentle – and the process was over in a few sec­onds.</p>
    <p>It was not com­pletely pain­less, but it cer­tainly was not as painful as other ex­pe­ri­ences such as bit­ing my lip or get­ting pinched, and def­i­nitely not enough to make me tear up. Dis­com­fort level: 3/10</p>
    <p>TEST 2</p>
    <p>Na­sopha­ryn­geal swab (con­ducted by a health­care pro­fes­sional) This is con­sid­ered the cur­rent gold stan­dard for tests due to its abil­ity to de­tect the virus.</p>
    <p>Some pa­tients re­flex­ively flinch or pull their heads away from the swab­ber when the swab en­ters their nose.</p>
    <p>In my case, I did not feel the swab un­til it hit the back of my nasal cav­ity, which was when I ex­pe­ri­enced the now-fa­mil­iar sense of get­ting wa­ter up my nose. It was slightly more painful, and I felt my eyes sting but did not tear up.</p>
    <p>Again, the process was over in a cou­ple of sec­onds. This test was not as painful as some peo­ple had de­scribed, and felt far bet­ter than an in­jec­tion. Dis­com­fort level: 4/10</p>
    <p>TEST 3</p>
    <p>Nasal swab</p>
    <p>A swab is in­serted par­tially up the nose by a health­care pro­fes­sional and ro­tated.</p>
    <p>Nasal swabs dif­fer from na­sopha­ryn­geal swabs as the swab is in­serted only par­tially up the nose.</p>
    <p>This makes it al­most com­pletely pain­less. The sen­sa­tion felt like dig­ging my nose and go­ing a lit­tle too far.</p>
    <p>Such swabs need to be paired with other tests to be ef­fec­tive, such as the oropha­ryn­geal swab at the back of the throat. Some swab­bers may pre­fer to use a com­bi­na­tion of the oropha­ryn­geal swab and the nasal swab in­stead of a na­sopha­ryn­geal swab. Dis­com­fort level: 1/10</p>
    <p>TEST 4 Oropha­ryn­geal swab</p>
    <p>A swab is in­serted to the back of the throat through the mouth till it is touch­ing the ton­sils, and moved around to col­lect sam­ples. It is of­ten paired with the nasal swab.</p>
    <p>De­spite no pain at all, I gagged in­stinc­tively when the swab touched the back of my throat. This made it rather un­com­fort­able, and it took an­other two tries be­fore I could sup­press my re­flex and the doc­tor could prop­erly swab me. Pa­tients who do not have as strong a gag re­flex may find this test less un­pleas­ant than those in­volv­ing the nose. Dis­com­fort level: 5/10</p>
