    <p>CON­TESTED RE­SULT</p>
    <p>Elec­tion is­sues, such as a con­tested re­sult in a key swing state, could lead to no can­di­date get­ting an out­right ma­jor­ity of 270 elec­toral votes. In this sit­u­a­tion, the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives will choose the new pres­i­dent from the top three can­di­dates. Each of the 50 states gets one vote and the can­di­date who wins at least 26 state votes be­comes pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The Se­nate elects the vice-pres­i­dent from the two re­main­ing can­di­dates, with each of the 100 sen­a­tors get­ting a vote. This Congress ses­sion will be led by Repub­li­can Vi­cePres­i­dent Mike Pence, the Se­nate’s cur­rent pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Only twice in Amer­i­can his­tory was its pres­i­dent elected this way: in 1800 and in 1824.</p>
    <p>More likely is a sit­u­a­tion like the one in Florida in 2000, when the re­sult was close enough to trig­ger an au­to­matic re­count un­der state law.</p>
    <p>This led to le­gal bat­tles be­tween the Bush and Gore cam­paigns that ul­ti­mately ended with a US Supreme Court rul­ing to stop the re­count. Repub­li­can can­di­date Ge­orge W. Bush went on to be pres­i­dent while his Demo­cratic op­po­nent Al Gore con­ceded in­stead of es­ca­lat­ing the sit­u­a­tion to Congress.</p>
    <p>Mr Donald Trump has said, more than once, that the 2020 elec­tion could end up with a de­ci­sion by the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans are com­mit­ted to nom­i­nat­ing and in­stalling Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett, a con­ser­va­tive, to the court by Elec­tion Day, which would bring the num­ber of Trumpap­pointed Supreme Court jus­tices to three of the nine spots.</p>
    <p>But that does not nec­es­sar­ily mean they will weigh in in his favour if it comes down to that. The Supreme Court may even de­cide not to rule on what it sees as a po­lit­i­cal mat­ter.</p>
    <p>This out­come may also change depend­ing on whether the Repub­li­cans keep or lose the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>TRUMP DOES NOT AC­CEPT LOSS</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has re­peat­edly re­fused to com­mit to ac­cept­ing the re­sult of the elec­tion if he loses, rais­ing a pos­si­bil­ity that he may say no to leav­ing the White House.</p>
    <p>States are brac­ing them­selves for a surge of mail-in bal­lots, and given the pan­demic, nearly half of the Democrats say they are plan­ning to vote by mail com­pared with only a quar­ter of Repub­li­cans who say the same. This raises the pos­si­bil­ity that votes counted ear­lier may show an early Trump vic­tory, only for his lead to erode.</p>
    <p>Should this hap­pen, Mr Trump may call the re­sults rigged, trig­ger­ing protests from his sup­port­ers and ef­forts from his cam­paign to ask the courts to re­ject some mailin bal­lots as in­valid.</p>
    <p>This also de­pends on a Bi­den mar­gin of vic­tory. If his op­po­nent wins by a land­slide, Mr Trump may lose the sup­port of the Repub­li­can Party, and may even be phys­i­cally re­moved from the White House, likely by the Se­cret Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>But if he and the Repub­li­cans dig their heels in, it may trig­ger an un­prece­dented con­sti­tu­tional cri­sis, es­pe­cially if the sit­u­a­tion is un­re­solved by In­au­gu­ra­tion Day.</p>
    <p>Quite likely, un­rest may hit the streets.</p>

With Pres&#xAD;i&#xAD;dent Trump hav&#xAD;ing come down with Covid-19, Mr Bi&#xAD;den will be able to show that his strat&#xAD;egy of wear&#xAD;ing masks and avoid&#xAD;ing large crowds was pru&#xAD;dent.</p>
