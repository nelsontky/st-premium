    <p>(France) • Tadej Po­gacar has yet to wear the yel­low jer­sey in this year’s Tour de France. The first time the 21-year-old will don the over­all leader’s jer­sey will be to ride into Paris today to be anointed as the cham­pion.</p>
    <p>He pro­duced one of the best rides in the com­pe­ti­tion’s his­tory to dis­place fel­low Slove­nian Pri­moz</p>
    <p>Roglic at the top, win­ning yes­ter­day’s penul­ti­mate stage – a 36.2km in­di­vid­ual time trial be­tween Lure and La Planche des Belles Filles.</p>
    <p>The UAE Team Emi­rates rider won the solo ef­fort against the clock as Roglic, who had started the day with a 57-sec­ond lead in the gen­eral clas­si­fi­ca­tion, cracked in the up­hill sec­tion, a 5.9km climb at an av­er­age gra­di­ent of 8.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The vic­tory in 55 min­utes and 55 sec­onds on Po­gacar’s Tour de­but is set to give him an in­cred­i­ble tre­ble, as he also claimed the King of the Moun­tain’s polka dots and the best young riders’ white jer­sey.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what to say, it’s a dream,” said Po­gacar, who now leads sec­ond-placed Roglic by 59 sec ahead of today’s fi­nal stage, a largely pro­ces­sional ride to the Champs El­y­sees in Paris where only the fi­nal sprint is con­tested as tra­di­tion dic­tates the leader is not at­tacked.</p>
    <p>“Get­ting the yel­low jer­sey on the fi­nal day, we were dream­ing of it since the start.</p>
    <p>“I knew ev­ery cor­ner on the road, thanks to the work of my team... My dream was just to be on the Tour de France and now I’ve won it. It’s un­be­liev­able.”</p>
    <p>Roglic, who had worn the yel­low jer­sey for 11 days, sat on the ground griev­ing af­ter blow­ing his lead but got up to hug and con­grat­u­late his coun­try­man – Slove­nia’s first Tour cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“I just ob­vi­ously didn’t push enough,” he says. “It was like that, I was just more and more with­out the power I needed. I gave it ev­ery­thing un­til the end.</p>
    <p>“We will see what hap­pens now. I can be happy with the re­sult and the rac­ing we showed here. Let’s take the pos­i­tive things out.”</p>
    <p>Roglic’s Jumbo-Visma team­mate Tom Du­moulin was sec­ond in the time trial – 1:21 be­hind Po­gacar.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Richie Porte of TrekSe­gafredo was third in the same time, enough to se­cure third place in the over­all stand­ings– 3:30 adrift of Po­gacar.</p>
    <p>The fi­nale brought back mem­o­ries of Greg Le­mond trail­ing Lau­rent Fignon by 50sec go­ing into the last stage in 1989 be­fore win­ning it by eight sec­onds.</p>
