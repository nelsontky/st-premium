    <p>In its bid to ri­val the United States, Bei­jing wants to es­tab­lish the in­dus­trial stan­dards that will shape fu­ture in­dus­tries. Ex­perts say that this in­ten­si­fy­ing US-China bat­tle to dom­i­nate stan­dards, es­pe­cially in emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies, could di­vide the world into dif­fer­ent in­dus­trial blocs.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG/BEI­JING • Mr Zhao Houlin is head of the United Na­tions’ telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions agency, an in­de­pen­dent in­ter­na­tional ar­biter that sets some of the rules shap­ing the modern tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try. But that does not stop him from let­ting his pa­tri­o­tism burst into the open.</p>
    <p>A former gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial in China, Mr Zhao has re­peat­edly li­onised the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive (BRI), the pet project of Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping to in­vest in over­seas in­fra­struc­ture. He has also de­fended Huawei, the con­tro­ver­sial Chi­nese telecoms cham­pion, against the United States’ ac­cu­sa­tions that its equip­ment can be used for es­pi­onage.</p>
    <p>“Those pre­oc­cu­pa­tions with Huawei equip­ment, up to now there is no proof so far,” Mr Zhao, who is sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the In­ter­na­tional Telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion Union (ITU), told re­porters in Geneva last year. “I would en­cour­age Huawei to be given equal op­por­tu­ni­ties to bid for busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>But it is in his un­abashed sup­port for Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy stan­dards that Mr Zhao’s loy­alty to Bei­jing is most strik­ing. Although he was sworn into his ITU role with a pledge to act “with the in­ter­est of the union only in view” while avoid­ing influence from any one coun­try, he reg­u­larly cel­e­brates China’s grow­ing pres­ence in the telecoms and In­ter­net in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>“Nowa­days in the dis­cus­sion of rel­e­vant ITU stan­dards, China’s tech­ni­cal strength is al­ready in the first ech­e­lon and the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity ex­pects China to play a greater role in the UN sys­tem,” Mr Zhao was quoted by the</p>
    <p>Peo­ple’s Daily, an of­fi­cial Chi­nese news­pa­per, as say­ing two weeks ago. In other state­ments car­ried by the Chi­nese me­dia, he has praised the role of the coun­try’s telecoms com­pa­nies in set­ting new in­dus­try stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhao de­clined to com­ment on his state­ments. His ad­vo­cacy of China’s in­ter­ests, how­ever, throws light on the in­ten­si­fy­ing geopo­lit­i­cal bat­tle­ground of tech­no­log­i­cal stan­dards, a much over­looked yet cru­cial as­pect of a new strug­gle for global influence be­tween China and the US.</p>
    <p>Such stan­dards might seem ob­scure, but they are a cru­cial el­e­ment of modern tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>If the Cold War was dom­i­nated by a race to build the most nu­clear weapons, the con­test be­tween the US and China – as well as the Euro­pean Union – will partly be played out through a strug­gle to con­trol the bu­reau­cratic rule-set­ting that lies be­hind the most im­por­tant in­dus­tries of the age.</p>
    <p>GEAR­ING UP</p>
    <p>The com­mer­cial and geopo­lit­i­cal power of in­dus­trial pro­to­cols has long been recog­nised. Werner von Siemens, the 19th-cen­tury Ger­man in­dus­tri­al­ist and in­no­va­tor who gave his name to the Siemens con­glom­er­ate he founded, said: “He who owns the stan­dards, owns the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Stan­dard-set­ting has for decades largely been the pre­serve of a small group of in­dus­tri­alised democ­ra­cies. Ev­ery­thing from the width of train tracks, to soft­ware, satel­lites, the fre­quen­cies that mo­bile phones use and a whole gamut of rules about how elec­tronic gad­gets work and process data have been de­cided by Western-dom­i­nated stan­dards or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>But China now has other ideas. “In­dus­trial stan­dards are an im­por­tant area of con­tes­ta­tion in the new Cold War, with both Bei­jing and Washington gear­ing up to shape the devel­op­ment and im­ple­men­ta­tion of global stan­dards”, says Dr Adam Se­gal, direc­tor of the dig­i­tal and cy­berspace pol­icy pro­gramme at the Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions, a New York-based think-tank.</p>
    <p>He and other ex­perts say an in­ten­si­fy­ing US-China bat­tle to dom­i­nate stan­dards, es­pe­cially in emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies, could start to di­vide the world into dif­fer­ent in­dus­trial blocs. In the same way that rail pas­sen­gers who travel from Western Europe to some former Soviet bloc coun­tries must to this day change trains to ac­com­mo­date dif­fer­ent track widths, strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion be­tween the US and China raises the spec­tre of a frag­men­ta­tion of stan­dards that cre­ates a new tech­no­log­i­cal di­vide.</p>
    <p>Dr Se­gal says it is pos­si­ble, for ex­am­ple, that 5G mo­bile telecoms – a bedrock tech­nol­ogy that en­ables the “In­ter­net of Things” – may be di­vided into two com­pet­ing stacks to re­flect US and Chi­nese influence. Some mea­sure of divi­sion is also pos­si­ble in semi­con­duc­tors, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) and other ar­eas where US-China ri­valry is in­tense, he adds.</p>
    <p>“In some sec­tors, there will be two stacks that are rel­a­tively in­com­pat­i­ble,” says Dr Se­gal. “But in oth­ers, there is likely to be some de­mand that they co­op­er­ate. It is pos­si­ble that large markets that make it clear they do not want to choose be­tween China and the US may be able to pres­sure Chi­nese and US tech firms to en­sure some de­gree of com­pat­i­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>In Washington, the bat­tle for influence over tech­nol­ogy stan­dards is seen in some quar­ters as cru­cial to de­fend­ing democ­racy from the influence of China, which former sec­re­tary of state Madeleine Al­bright de­scribes as “the world’s lead­ing pi­o­neer of what we call techno-au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism”.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic vice-chair of the US Se­nate in­tel­li­gence com­mit­tee Mark Warner sees the threat from China in equally un­am­bigu­ous terms. Bei­jing is in­tend­ing to con­trol the next gen­er­a­tion of dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture, he says, and, as it does so, to im­pose prin­ci­ples that are an­ti­thet­i­cal to US val­ues of trans­parency, di­ver­sity of opin­ion, in­ter­op­er­abil­ity and re­spect for hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>“Over the last 10 to 15 years, (the US) lead­er­ship role has eroded and our lever­age to es­tab­lish stan­dards and pro­to­cols re­flect­ing our val­ues has di­min­ished,” Mr Warner told a we­bi­nar last month. “As a re­sult, oth­ers, but mostly China, have stepped into the void to ad­vance stan­dards and val­ues that ad­van­tage the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party.”</p>
    <p>“Com­mu­nist Party lead­ers are de­vel­op­ing a model of tech­no­log­i­cal gover­nance that... would make Or­well blush,” Mr Warner added, re­fer­ring to Ge­orge Or­well, the Bri­tish writer of dystopian novel 1984.</p>
    <p>Such is­sues are ex­er­cis­ing oth­ers in Washington too. Two con­gress­men, Mr David Sch­weik­ert and Dr Ami Bera, in­tro­duced bi­par­ti­san leg­is­la­tion called the En­sur­ing Amer­i­can Lead­er­ship</p>
    <p>Over In­ter­na­tional Stan­dards Act in June to com­mis­sion a study on China’s influence in the set­ting of global tech­nol­ogy stan­dards.</p>
    <p>MIL­I­TARY AND CIVIL AP­PLI­CA­TIONS</p>
    <p>From a US per­spec­tive, China’s chal­lenge de­rives from three main ar­eas.</p>
    <p>First, it is de­vel­op­ing world-beat­ing tech­nol­ogy in sev­eral emerg­ing ar­eas, such as 5G telecoms and AI. Sec­ond, as it ex­ports this tech­nol­ogy – of­ten to the more than 100 coun­tries that par­tic­i­pate in the BRI – it is nur­tur­ing ad­her­ence to a dis­tinctly Chi­nese set of stan­dards and pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Third, Bei­jing is boost­ing its influence in the UN and other stan­dard-set­ting bod­ies to en­hance the in­ter­ests of its own com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Mr Yang Guang, a Bei­jing-based senior an­a­lyst at con­sul­tancy Strat­egy An­a­lyt­ics, says China has long been in­ter­ested in rais­ing the pro­file of its tech­nol­ogy stan­dards. “It is just that for­eign­ers didn’t pay at­ten­tion be­fore,” he says, nam­ing as ex­am­ples TD-SCMA and WAPI, two telecoms stan­dards that largely failed to catch on more than a decade ago.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is work­ing to­wards a stan­dards mas­ter­plan – China Stan­dards</p>
    <p>2035 – which Bei­jing was ex­pected to pub­lish be­fore the end of this year. The strat­egy is ex­pected to set out stan­dard­i­s­a­tion goals for cru­cial next-gen­er­a­tion tech­nolo­gies. It is also due to em­pha­sise the im­per­a­tive to strengthen China’s role in stan­dards or­gan­i­sa­tions, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>“The strat­egy will also fo­cus on stan­dards to fa­cil­i­tate civil-mil­i­tary fu­sion – a con­cept that has gained con­sid­er­able trac­tion in China and has caused a stir in strate­gic com­mu­ni­ties over­seas, par­tic­u­larly in Washington,” wrote re­search fel­low John Sea­man in a re­port this year for the French In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Re­la­tions and the Pol­icy Cen­tre for the New South.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary-civil fu­sion is a plan to use the best of civil­ian re­search and devel­op­ment to bol­ster the tech­no­log­i­cal ca­pac­i­ties of the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army.</p>
    <p>The drive is led by Mr Xi him­self, who heads the Com­mis­sion for Mil­i­tary-Civil Fu­sion Devel­op­ment. It is be­lieved to tar­get civil­ian ad­vances in “dual-use” ar­eas such as quan­tum com­put­ing, big data, semi­con­duc­tors, 5G and AI, but con­crete ini­tia­tives are shrouded in se­crecy.</p>
    <p>“China’s great­est po­ten­tial lies in ar­eas where stan­dards have yet to be col­lec­tively de­vel­oped and de­fined,” Mr Sea­man says.</p>
    <p>“It can roll out tech­nolo­gies us­ing Chi­nese stan­dards in for­eign markets, cre­at­ing ‘facts on the ground’.”</p>
    <p>DIG­I­TAL SILK ROAD</p>
    <p>Cru­cial to the goal of pop­u­lar­is­ing Chi­nese stan­dards over­seas is the BRI, which Mr Zhao de­scribed in a blog on the ITU’s web­site as hold­ing “so much prom­ise”.</p>
    <p>The BRI is gen­er­ally seen as a huge Chi­nese pro­gramme to build roads, rail­ways, ports, air­ports and other forms of in­fra­struc­ture in mostly de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. But this por­trayal over­looks a key point. The BRI is also a means of dif­fus­ing Chi­nese tech­nolo­gies – and the stan­dards they op­er­ate on – across the de­vel­op­ing world by con­struct­ing what Bei­jing calls a “dig­i­tal silk road”.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has been ac­tively pro­mot­ing its In­ter­net and cy­ber gover­nance play­book in many de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, most re­cently by lever­ag­ing 5G con­nec­tiv­ity and smart city projects along the dig­i­tal silk road,” says Ms Rebecca Arce­sati, an an­a­lyst at Mer­ics, a Ber­lin-based think-tank.</p>
    <p>“Smart cities” are a fo­cus of this stan­dards dif­fu­sion ef­fort be­cause they in­cor­po­rate so many emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies. The fa­cial recog­ni­tion sys­tems, big data anal­y­sis, 5G telecoms and AI cam­eras that go into cre­at­ing smart cities are all tech­nolo­gies for which stan­dards re­main up for grabs.</p>
    <p>Thus smart cities, which au­to­mate mul­ti­ple mu­nic­i­pal func­tions, rep­re­sent a big prize for China’s stan­dards drive.</p>
    <p>“China is set­ting stan­dards from the bot­tom-up through wide­spread ex­port and for­eign adop­tion of its tech­nol­ogy,” says Mr Jonathan Hillman, an an­a­lyst at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies, a Washington-based think-tank.</p>
    <p>“A coun­try such as Ser­bia might not sit down and de­cide they want to adopt Chi­nese stan­dards, but af­ter enough pur­chases and deals, they might end up with Chi­nese stan­dards. There is the risk of lock-in, a point af­ter which switch­ing be­comes too costly.”</p>
    <p>Ser­bia is just one of many coun­tries that has signed up to a Chi­nese-in­stalled smart city pack­age com­plete with sur­veil­lance cam­eras sup­plied by Hikvi­sion, a com­pany black­listed by the US be­cause of sus­pected hu­man rights abuses in Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the smart city pack­age is prov­ing im­mensely pop­u­lar for gov­ern­ments that wish to au­to­mate ser­vices – such as traf­fic man­age­ment, sewage sys­tems and public safety – while keep­ing a close eye on what its peo­ple are up to.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to re­search by RWR Ad­vi­sory, a Washington-based con­sul­tancy, Chi­nese com­pa­nies have made 116 deals to in­stall smart city and “safe city” pack­ages around the world since 2013, with 70 of these tak­ing place in coun­tries that also par­tic­i­pate in the BRI.</p>
    <p>The main dif­fer­ence be­tween “smart” and “safe” city equip­ment is that the lat­ter is in­tended pri­mar­ily to surveil and mon­i­tor the pop­u­la­tion, while the former is pri­mar­ily aimed at au­tomat­ing mu­nic­i­pal func­tions while also in­cor­po­rat­ing sur­veil­lance func­tions.</p>
    <p>Cities in Western and South­ern Europe to­gether signed up to a to­tal of 25 such “smart” and “safe” projects, ac­cord­ing to RWR Ad­vi­sory. Cities in South-east Asia and the Mid­dle East were also key re­cip­i­ents, tak­ing 16 and 15 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>RWR Ad­vi­sory chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer An­drew Davenport says smart cities open the door to a se­ries of risks. “Smart cities es­sen­tially in­crease the down­side risk con­sid­er­ably of cy­ber in­tru­sions or abuses, both in terms of data se­cu­rity and cy­ber se­cu­rity,” he says. “The cy­ber risk that is as­so­ci­ated with en­ti­ties that are sub­ject to Chi­nese laws and gover­nance struc­tures is am­pli­fied in this en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>Along­side these ex­port moves de­signed to in­cul­cate its tech­nol­ogy stan­dards, China is also ac­tive in sign­ing po­lit­i­cal agree­ments to the same end.</p>
    <p>The 2019 China Stan­dard­i­s­a­tion Devel­op­ment an­nual re­port, an of­fi­cial doc­u­ment, makes clear that pro­mot­ing Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy stan­dards is a BRI pri­or­ity. As of last year, some 85 stan­dard­i­s­a­tion co­op­er­a­tion agree­ments with 49 coun­tries and re­gions had been signed, though scant lit­er­a­ture ex­ists on the depth and spe­cific con­tents of such agree­ments.</p>
    <p>IN­STI­TU­TIONAL PUSH</p>
    <p>Not con­tent with forg­ing bi­lat­eral agree­ments along the Belt and Road, China is also try­ing to per­suade mul­ti­lat­eral stan­dards agen­cies to recog­nise its grow­ing clout.</p>
    <p>As re­cently as 2007, China was a min­now in the In­ter­na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Stan­dard­i­s­a­tion (ISO), one of the world’s lead­ing stan­dard-set­ting bod­ies, with 164 mem­ber coun­tries. Back then, it had sparse rep­re­sen­ta­tion on the all-im­por­tant tech­ni­cal com­mit­tees and sub-com­mit­tees that do much to de­cide which stan­dards to adopt.</p>
    <p>But in 2008, Bei­jing man­aged to win a place as the sixth per­ma­nent mem­ber of the ISO’s coun­cil and in 2013 it be­came a per­ma­nent mem­ber of its tech­ni­cal man­age­ment board, along­side the US, Ja­pan, Bri­tain, Ger­many and France.</p>
    <p>In 2015, the or­gan­i­sa­tion got its first Chi­nese pres­i­dent when former steel in­dus­try ex­ec­u­tive Zhang Xiao­gang was cho­sen for a three-year term.</p>
    <p>It has been a sim­i­lar story at the 88-mem­ber In­ter­na­tional Elec­trotech­ni­cal Com­mis­sion (IEC), an or­gan­i­sa­tion that pub­lishes stan­dards on all elec­tronic items. China’s influence at the IEC has grown steadily, cul­mi­nat­ing in the ap­point­ment in Jan­uary of Dr Shu Yin­biao – who is also chair­man of the State Grid Cor­po­ra­tion of China – as pres­i­dent of the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhao com­pletes the pic­ture as head of the ITU, which he is due to lead un­til 2023.</p>
    <p>The in­creased rep­re­sen­ta­tion has had a marked ef­fect on China’s stan­dard-set­ting clout. As of March last year, for in­stance, China had pro­posed 11 stan­dards for the In­ter­net of Things within the ISO/IEC frame­work, of which five had been adopted and pub­lished and six were still pend­ing re­view, Mr Sea­man said.</p>
    <p>State Grid Cor­po­ra­tion of China has also pulled off a coup. The IEC has agreed to take on co­or­di­nat­ing stan­dards for a con­cept called Global En­ergy In­ter­con­nec­tion, which es­sen­tially aims to cre­ate huge grids of power ca­bles that run be­tween coun­tries and con­ti­nents. If the idea gets off the ground, it could di­rectly ben­e­fit State Grid, which is the global leader in mak­ing ul­tra-high volt­age trans­mis­sion lines.</p>
    <p>The build-up of such in­sti­tu­tional fire­power in these stan­dard-set­ting bod­ies is a sure sign that China is set to wield much more influence over global tech­no­log­i­cal stan­dards.</p>
    <p>But equally as sure is that the back­lash from Washington is build­ing. Europe, for its part, is likely to be squeezed by com­pet­ing su­per­power am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>“The non-trans­par­ent and au­thor­i­tar­ian way in which China is go­ing about data se­cu­rity man­age­ment at home un­der­mines trust in its stan­dards and plat­forms abroad,” says Ms Arce­sati. “On the other hand, the cur­rent US strat­egy is es­sen­tially equat­ing data se­cu­rity with a to­tal and uni­lat­eral de­cou­pling from Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy in the dig­i­tal do­main.</p>
    <p>“This puts Europe in an ex­tremely dif­fi­cult po­si­tion,” she adds.</p>
    <p>The worst-case sce­nario, as de­scribed by Mr Sea­man, is of a grow­ing tech­no­log­i­cal di­vide. If in­ter­na­tional col­lab­o­ra­tion on stan­dards grinds to a halt, it could cre­ate op­pos­ing tech­nol­ogy blocs that do not talk to each other. “Think of it al­most like try­ing to con­nect with some­one on WeChat by us­ing Face­book, but on an in­dus­trial scale.”</p>
    <p>Mr Davenport sees a sim­i­lar risk. “If the US does en­gage more proac­tively in try­ing to con­front Chi­nese influence over stan­dard-set­ting bod­ies... it could lead China to ex­plore cre­at­ing par­al­lel al­ter­na­tives. This could ul­ti­mately re­sult in a more bi­fur­cated arena on in­dus­trial stan­dards.”</p>
    <p>GREAT PO­TEN­TIAL</p>
    <p>China’s great­est po­ten­tial lies in ar­eas where stan­dards have yet to be col­lec­tively de­vel­oped and de­fined... It can roll out tech­nolo­gies us­ing Chi­nese stan­dards in for­eign markets, cre­at­ing ‘facts on the ground’.</p>
