    <p>Be­cause the hu­man toll of Covid-19 is so stag­ger­ing, few have no­ticed that an­i­mals and the en­vi­ron­ment have been hard-hit by the pan­demic too. The Sunday Times</p>
    <p>talks to those who are keep­ing watch on the earth and the wel­fare of its furry crea­tures, crit­ters and other wild things</p>
    <p>Last year, Ms Melodee Tan, 29, founder of non-profit ad­vo­cacy group Hope for An­i­mals (HFA), wanted to live stream adop­tion events to reach a wider au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Her fi­ance and fel­low ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee mem­ber Do­minic Neo, 29, who pre­vi­ously worked in the events in­dus­try and is be­tween jobs, came up with the idea after watch­ing live-stream gam­ing.</p>
    <p>But lack­ing the ex­per­tise, they put the idea on the back burner, un­til Covid-19 coaxed it out of stor­age.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, the pan­demic has forced an­i­mal wel­fare ac­tivists to get wildly cre­ative.</p>
    <p>Un­able to hold large-scale events such as fund-rais­ing gala din­ners and phys­i­cal adop­tion drives, these groups have gone on­line, re­ly­ing on live stream­ing, In­sta­gram sto­ries and on­line talk shows to fea­ture dogs, cats and rab­bits which need new homes.</p>
    <p>In April, just be­fore cir­cuit breaker mea­sures kicked in, Ms Tan roped in about 35 vol­un­teers from the arts and me­dia com­mu­ni­ties to launch an on­line adop­tion drive called Pro­ject Adopt Live, which show­cases an­i­mals liv­ing in shel­ters or at fos­ter homes.</p>
    <p>Her vol­un­teer-run group, HFA, does pub­lic out­reach for about 10 shel­ters, help­ing them to raise funds and aware­ness.</p>
    <p>After Covid-19 flared up, she had to can­cel 12 adop­tion drives-cum­fund-rais­ing events planned this year. The car­ni­val-like events, usu­ally held at parks and malls, used to fea­ture ven­dors selling pet-re­lated prod­ucts as well as work­shops, talks and games.</p>
    <p>These have since moved on­line. Although vir­tual adop­tion drives do not have the same reach as phys­i­cal events, Ms Tan ob­serves they at­tract more se­ri­ous adopters, com­pared with gawk­ers and fam­i­lies look­ing for a day out at a pet car­ni­val.</p>
    <p>Fewer dis­trac­tions and the se­cu­rity of a com­puter screen also mean po­ten­tial adopters are more will­ing to ask ques­tions about train­ing and car­ing for the an­i­mal.</p>
    <p>Another up­side of vir­tual adop­tion drives is they help even the play­ing field for older – and less de­sir­able – an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cally, pup­pies and kit­tens are “hot stock” and get snapped up quickly. Cat Wel­fare So­ci­ety (CWS) pres­i­dent Thenuga Vi­jaku­mar notes that it usu­ally takes adult cats aged over a year much longer to find a home.</p>
    <p>But on­line, shel­ters get to pro­file older an­i­mals such as nine-year-old James, an af­fec­tion­ate cat which has lived in the So­ci­ety for the Preven­tion of Cru­elty to An­i­mals shel­ter for the past two years.</p>
    <p>Adop­tion drive live-stream hosts, such as mar­ried ac­tors Jo Tan and Ed­ward Choy, who are dog own­ers, use the plat­form to ed­u­cate view­ers on the ben­e­fits of adopt­ing older an­i­mals, such as how they are of­ten toi­let-trained and eas­ier to in­te­grate into a new house­hold.</p>
    <p>By in­ter­act­ing with the dogs on cam­era, hosts and shel­ter staff also de­bunk stereo­types that these older dogs are ag­gres­sive or “dam­aged”, says Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing these episodes, celebrity guests such as MTV VJ Hanli Hoe­fer pop in to share her pet sto­ries. Oth­ers speak on top­ics such as how to cat-proof a home and how dogs and new­born ba­bies can co-ex­ist.</p>
    <p>“When you take in a dog that a lot of other peo­ple have been quick to dis­miss, you’re chang­ing an an­i­mal’s life. To see it open up and be­come the lov­ing an­i­mal it in­nately is, that’s the true re­ward,” says Hoe­fer, who has two adopted dogs.</p>
    <p>HFA has since aired about 15 live-stream episodes so far, with each fea­tur­ing five to eight an­i­mals. About half of these have suc­cess­fully found new homes.</p>
    <p>And although Ms Tan does not have pre-pan­demic adop­tion fig­ures from the in­di­vid­ual shel­ters, she be­lieves over­all adop­tion rates dur­ing and after the cir­cuit breaker have gone up.</p>
    <p>She at­tributes this trend to peo­ple stay­ing home more dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and be­yond, which has given them a new-found ap­pre­ci­a­tion of sim­ple joys, such as spend­ing time with loved ones and per­haps wel­com­ing a new furkid into the house­hold.</p>
    <p>“When times are hard, it forces you to re­flect on your goals and de­sires. Some peo­ple have be­come used to be­ing at home and re­alised they are ready for a pet as they don’t need to go out as of­ten,” she says.</p>
    <p>Ms Thenuga, 34, says adop­tions for CWS have also in­creased. Only an aver­age of 15 cats un­der its care found new homes each month be­fore Covid-19, com­pared with more than 20 a month of late.</p>
    <p>The former lawyer be­lieves this is partly due to the suc­cess of its Adop­tion Satur­days cam­paign since April, where it posts photos and videos of cats on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Since last month, it has also taken part in on­line adop­tion drives such as e-Pets’ Day Out, or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Parks Board.</p>
    <p>But although adop­tions have gone up, there are ever more cats look­ing for new homes.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the so­ci­ety, which runs a ster­il­i­sa­tion pro­gramme to man­age Sin­ga­pore’s cat pop­u­la­tion, had to halt these ef­forts for six weeks dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, lead­ing to a spike in the num­ber of stray cats. Some fe­lines also re­side in worker dor­mi­to­ries, which are still off-lim­its to the team.</p>
    <p>As cats need only about 60 days to re­pro­duce, the work of ster­il­i­sa­tion, me­di­a­tion, ed­u­ca­tion and ad­vo­cacy never stops. So, be­yond the pan­demic, Ms Thenuga says CWS will con­tinue to hold on­line</p>
    <p>adop­tion drives, us­ing them to com­ple­ment in-per­son adop­tion events when it is safe to do so.</p>
    <p>“When you are talking to a fos­terer and in­ter­act with the cat, you get a sense of the cat’s per­son­al­ity in per­son. It is a much richer ex­pe­ri­ence than a video call or photos. But given the con­straints, go­ing on­line at l east helps us in­crease the vis­i­bil­ity of cats look­ing for new homes,” says Ms Thenuga.</p>
    <p>She is con­fi­dent that if cat lovers in Sin­ga­pore can rise to t he oc­ca­sion even amid a pan­demic, the char­ity will be able to weather storms ahead.</p>
    <p>“It has been hum­bling to see the com­mu­nity band to­gether and peo­ple’s pri­or­i­ties emerge,” she says. “Even in dis­tressed times, peo­ple see a need for an­i­mal wel­fare.”</p>
