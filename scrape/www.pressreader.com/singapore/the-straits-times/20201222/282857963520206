    <p>UNITED STATES • Pop star Ari­ana Grande is en­gaged to lux­ury real es­tate agent Dal­ton Gomez, she an­nounced on In­sta­gram on Sun­day. Shar­ing pho­tos of her­self with Gomez (and a di­a­mond and pearl ring), she cap­tioned her post, “For­ever n then some”.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old had hinted at her re­la­tion­ship with Gomez over the past year, tuck­ing pho­tos with him into stacks of im­ages shared on In­sta­gram. A mu­sic video for her col­lab­o­ra­tion with Justin Bieber on this year’s Stuck With U, a nod to quar­an­tine, was the cou­ple’s pub­lic de­but in May, fea­tur­ing a clip of Grande and Gomez danc­ing.</p>
    <p>Along with its “un­apolo­get­i­cally and some­times hu­mor­ously li­bidi­nous lyrics”, Grande’s most re­cent al­bum, Po­si­tions, which was re­leased in Oc­to­ber, has “oc­ca­sional slips of vul­ner­a­bil­ity that re­veal the gid­di­ness and anx­i­ety of new love”, The New York Times wrote in its re­view.</p>
    <p>Gomez, a real es­tate agent at the Aaron Kir­man Group in Los An­ge­les, was born and raised in South­ern Cal­i­for­nia, ac­cord­ing to his pro­file on the agency’s web­site. He has worked in lux­ury real es­tate for five years, over­see­ing sales of homes like the late ar­chi­tect Pierre Koenig’s Case Study No. 21 in Los An­ge­les, which served as the set of Charmed (1998 to 2006).</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter the re­lease of Grande’s 2018 al­bum, Sweet­ener, her for­mer boyfriend, rap­per Mac Miller, died of an ac­ci­den­tal over­dose at 26. He had col­lab­o­rated with Grande on her hit song, The Way, in 2013.</p>
    <p>“I adored you from the day I met you when I was 19 and I al­ways will,” she said of Miller in a post on In­sta­gram af­ter his death.</p>
    <p>At the time of his death, she had been en­gaged to co­me­dian Pete David­son, 27, for only a few months. Grande called off the en­gage­ment shortly af­ter.</p>
    <p>David­son at­trib­uted their split to Miller’s death, telling ra­dio host Char­la­m­agne Tha God in an in­ter­view that “I pretty much knew it was over af­ter that”.</p>
    <p>Grande, gained promi­nence as Cat Valen­tine on the Nick­elodeon show Vic­to­ri­ous, which aired from 2010 to 2013, but it was her mu­sic ca­reer that gave her in­ter­na­tional star­dom. Her re­cent song Po­si­tions peaked at No. 1 on the Bill­board Global 200.</p>
