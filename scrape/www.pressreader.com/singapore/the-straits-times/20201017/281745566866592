    <p>LON­DON • The world’s in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial cap­i­tal Lon­don was set to en­ter a tighter Covid-19 lock­down from mid­night last night as Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son seeks to tackle a swiftly ac­cel­er­at­ing sec­ond coro­n­avirus wave.</p>
    <p>The res­pi­ra­tory pan­demic, which emerged in China last year and has killed more than a mil­lion peo­ple world­wide, is spread­ing in most parts of Bri­tain, whose of­fi­cial death toll of 43,155 is the high­est in Europe.</p>
    <p>Anger, though, is ris­ing over the eco­nomic, so­cial and health costs of the big­gest cur­tail­ment of free­doms since war­time.</p>
    <p>One for­mer gov­ern­ment ad­viser warned some peo­ple would have trou­ble cloth­ing their chil­dren soon.</p>
    <p>Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock said Lon­don – which has a pop­u­la­tion of nine mil­lion – and the ad­ja­cent, heav­ily pop­u­lated county of</p>
    <p>Es­sex would be put on a high alert level, up from medium, at one minute past mid­night (7.01am to­day, Sin­ga­pore time).</p>
    <p>The main im­pact of the move to the high alert level is that peo­ple can­not meet other house­holds so­cially in any set­ting in­doors – for ex­am­ple, at home or in a res­tau­rant.</p>
    <p>Travel should be re­duced where pos­si­ble, Mr Han­cock said.</p>
    <p>“Things will get worse be­fore they get bet­ter,” Mr Han­cock said. “But I know that there are brighter skies and calmer seas ahead – that the in­ge­nu­ity of sci­ence will find a way through, and un­til then, we must come to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s move to halt so­cial­is­ing in its cap­i­tal means that Lon­don and Paris – Europe’s two rich­est cities – are shortly to be liv­ing un­der the shadow of state-im­posed re­stric­tions as the sec­ond wave of the out­break spreads through Europe.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron an­nounced night cur­fews for four weeks from to­day in Paris and other ma­jor cities.</p>
    <p>Daily cases in France have jumped to more than 17,000 from less than 12,000 a week ago, and more than 40 per cent of in­ten­sive­care beds in the Paris re­gion are taken by Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>There is now even the sug­ges­tion that France’s re­gional elec­tions next March will be de­layed.</p>
    <p>Lon­don, the world’s cen­tre for in­ter­na­tional bank­ing and for­eign ex­change trad­ing, is ri­valled only by New York in fi­nan­cial clout.</p>
    <p>The worst-hit Lon­don ar­eas are Richmond, Hack­ney, the City of Lon­don, Eal­ing, Red­bridge and Har­row.</p>
    <p>Lon­don Mayor Sadiq Khan said: “I must warn Lon­don­ers: We’ve got a dif­fi­cult win­ter ahead.”</p>
    <p>Manch­ester, in the north of Eng­land and one of Bri­tain’s largest cities, had been tipped to be moved to “very high” alert from “high”, but Mr Han­cock said talks with lo­cal lead­ers were con­tin­u­ing, so no de­ci­sion had yet been made.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son, who scored a land­slide elec­tion vic­tory last December, says his gov­ern­ment is fight­ing a war against the virus and that some sac­ri­fices are nec­es­sary to save lives. But op­po­nents say his Con­ser­va­tive gov­ern­ment was too slow to act when the virus first struck, failed to pro­tect the el­derly in care homes, and bun­gled the test­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In ar­eas put on the high alert level, so­cial­is­ing out­side house­holds or sup­port bub­bles is not al­lowed in­doors, though work can con­tinue and schools con­tinue to op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>The “very high” alert level for­bids so­cial­is­ing, forces pubs and bars to close and pro­hibits travel out­side the area.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s for­mer home­less­ness ad­viser, Dame Louise Casey, said Bri­tain faces a “pe­riod of des­ti­tu­tion” in which some fam­i­lies “can’t put shoes on” chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“Are we ac­tu­ally ask­ing peo­ple in places like Liver­pool to go out and pros­ti­tute them­selves, so that they could put food on the ta­ble?” Ms Casey told the BBC.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool in Eng­land’s north-west is al­ready in the high­est-risk tier.</p>
    <p>“There’s this sense from Down­ing Street and from West­min­ster that peo­ple will make do,” Ms Casey said, re­fer­ring to the na­tional gov­ern­ment’s head­quar­ters. “Well, they weren’t cop­ing be­fore Covid.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">To tackle Bri&#xAD;tain&#x2019;s sec&#xAD;ond wave of coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus in&#xAD;fec&#xAD;tions, Lon&#xAD;don and the ad&#xAD;ja&#xAD;cent county of Es&#xAD;sex are on a high alert level as of 7.01am to&#xAD;day, Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore time. This means peo&#xAD;ple can&#xAD;not meet those from other house&#xAD;holds so&#xAD;cially in any in&#xAD;door set&#xAD;ting.</p>
