    <p>SEOUL • The South Korean au­thor­i­ties have urged vig­i­lance as small coro­n­avirus clus­ters emerged in a third wave, cen­tred in the Seoul area, with in­fec­tions near nine-month highs.</p>
    <p>The Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency (KDCA) yes­ter­day re­ported 583 new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, down from the 629 re­ported on Fri­day, which was the high­est since the first wave peaked in Fe­bru­ary and early March.</p>
    <p>Af­ter im­ple­ment­ing tighter re­stric­tions yes­ter­day, the gov­ern­ment is to de­cide to­day whether to fur­ther tighten curbs in a coun­try that had seen ini­tial suc­cess through ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing and other steps.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions of the virus that causes Covid-19 av­er­aged 487.9 last week, up 80 cases from the week be­fore. This wave of in­fec­tions is dif­fer­ent from the first two, which were driven by large-scale trans­mis­sion, said KDCA of­fi­cial Lim Sook-young.</p>
    <p>“The re­cent out­breaks are small, mul­ti­ple and are spread in peo­ple’s ev­ery­day lives,” Ms Lim told a news brief­ing.</p>
    <p>“Please keep in mind that the cur­rent wave is not lim­ited to a spe­cific group or place but may be around our homes, fam­ily and ac­quain­tances.”</p>
    <p>Seoul ac­counted for 235 of the new in­fec­tions. More than half of South Korea’s 52 mil­lion peo­ple live in the cap­i­tal and sur­round­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Among Seoul’s small but widespread clus­ters, con­firmed cases linked to a dance class rose by nine to 249 in less than two weeks, while 21 peo­ple tested pos­i­tive in a clus­ter re­lated to a wine bar.</p>
    <p>Seoul launched un­prece­dented cur­fews yes­ter­day, shut­ter­ing most es­tab­lish­ments and shops at 9 pm for two weeks and cut­ting back pub­lic trans­porta­tion op­er­a­tions by 30 per cent in the evenings.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple se­ri­ously or se­verely ill with Covid-19 rose by five to 121, us­ing more of the na­tion’s dwin­dling num­ber of sickbeds, KDCA re­ported. The health au­thor­i­ties said on Fri­day there were just 59 sickbeds im­me­di­ately avail­able for se­ri­ous or se­vere cases and the beds might run out in less than two weeks.</p>
    <p>South Korea has re­ported 36,915 coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and 540 deaths, the KDCA said.</p>
