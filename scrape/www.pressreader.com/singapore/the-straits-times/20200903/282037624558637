    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore re­tained its po­si­tion as the world’s 25th top univer­sity and Asia’s third best, ac­cord­ing to the Times Higher Ed­u­ca­tion rank­ings re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>China’s Ts­inghua Univer­sity, Asia’s top univer­sity, be­came the first univer­sity in the re­gion to break into the global top 20 when it was ranked by the higher ed­u­ca­tion pub­li­ca­tion in 20th place. Pek­ing Univer­sity, ranked sec­ond in Asia, was placed in the 23rd po­si­tion glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The Nanyang Technologi­cal Univer­sity (NTU) moved up one place to the 47th po­si­tion this year.</p>
    <p>Times Higher Ed­u­ca­tion had as­sessed uni­ver­si­ties on 13 per­for­mance in­di­ca­tors grouped into five ar­eas: teach­ing (the learn­ing en­vi­ron­ment); re­search (vol­ume, in­come and rep­u­ta­tion); ci­ta­tions (re­search in­flu­ence); in­ter­na­tional out­look (staff, stu­dents and re­search); and in­dus­try in­come (knowl­edge trans­fer).</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s Univer­sity of Oxford re­tained its top spot for the fifth con­sec­u­tive year.</p>
    <p>It was fol­lowed by four uni­ver­si­ties in the United States – Stan­ford, Har­vard, the Cal­i­for­nia In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy and the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on Ts­inghua Univer­sity’s rise, Times Higher Ed­u­ca­tion said the in­sti­tu­tion’s achieve­ment is an in­di­ca­tor of the wider pos­i­tive move­ments in higher ed­u­ca­tion for main­land China, and the rest of Asia in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, there are 16 Asian uni­ver­si­ties in the top 100.</p>
    <p>Mr Phil Baty, chief knowl­edge of­fi­cer at the pub­li­ca­tion, said the trend of uni­ver­si­ties in Asia do­ing bet­ter is likely to ac­cel­er­ate fur­ther.</p>
    <p>He added that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic her­alds huge chal­lenges for pri­mar­ily west­ern uni­ver­si­ties, par­tic­u­larly those in the US and Bri­tain, “who face the very real risk of los­ing sig­nif­i­cant in­ter­na­tional stu­dent tal­ent, and the bil­lions of dol­lars in fees that they bring”.</p>
    <p>“While the uni­ver­si­ties at the very top of the ta­ble, with long his­to­ries of suc­cess and pres­tige, will prove hard to un­seat, these fac­tors, com­bined with the ef­fects of a pos­si­ble deep and long-last­ing global re­ces­sion and its likely im­pact on univer­sity fund­ing lev­els, could her­ald the start of a dra­matic re­bal­anc­ing of the global knowl­edge econ­omy,” he said.</p>
    <p>NUS said it was heart­ened to be ranked among the lead­ing uni­ver­si­ties in the world and Asia.</p>
    <p>It added that, now more than ever, uni­ver­si­ties play a crit­i­cal role as a con­duit for learn­ing and in­no­va­tion – to equip stu­dents, in­dus­tries and coun­tries for a post-coro­n­avirus world.</p>
    <p>Since the onset of the pan­demic, the univer­sity has been work­ing on Covid-19-re­lated re­search, rang­ing from rapid di­ag­nos­tics, vac­cine de­vel­op­ment and ac­cel­er­at­ing dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts to cre­ate a mul­ti­modal, blended learn­ing en­vi­ron­ment for its stu­dents.</p>
    <p>NTU said the Times Higher Ed­u­ca­tion rank­ing is yet an­other in­di­ca­tor of its con­tin­ued up­ward tra­jec­tory in all the ma­jor global in­dexes.</p>
    <p>This year’s rank­ing an­a­lysed over 86 mil­lion ci­ta­tions across more than 13.6 mil­lion re­search pub­li­ca­tions and in­cluded sur­vey re­sponses from 22,000 schol­ars glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Mr Phil Baty, chief knowl­edge of­fi­cer at Times Higher Ed­u­ca­tion, said the pan­demic her­alds huge chal­lenges for pri­mar­ily west­ern uni­ver­si­ties, par­tic­u­larly those in the US and Bri­tain, “who face the very real risk of los­ing sig­nif­i­cant in­ter­na­tional stu­dent tal­ent, and the bil­lions of dol­lars in fees that they bring”.</p>
