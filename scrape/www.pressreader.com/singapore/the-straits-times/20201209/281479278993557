    <p>A land­mark study of more than 100,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans has found that those whose par­ents di­vorced be­fore they turned 21 earned less than those whose par­ents stayed to­gether.</p>
    <p>They also were less likely to get a univer­sity de­gree or get mar­ried – these were among other long-term “di­vorce penal­ties” or dis­ad­van­tages high­lighted by the study, which ex­am­ined mar­i­tal and eco­nomic data of Sin­ga­porean chil­dren born be­tween 1979 and 1981. The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment re­leased the find­ings yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A land­mark study ex­am­in­ing the mar­i­tal and eco­nomic records of more than 100,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans found that their par­ents’ di­vorce in­flicted a long-last­ing toll on key ar­eas of their lives.</p>
    <p>At age 35, these adult chil­dren whose par­ents di­vorced be­fore they turned 21 earned less than their peers whose par­ents stayed to­gether, and they them­selves were more likely to get di­vorced, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF) study.</p>
    <p>The first lo­cal study of its kind, ti­tled In­ter-gen­er­a­tional Ef­fects of Di­vorce on Chil­dren in Sin­ga­pore, found they face long-term “di­vorce penal­ties” or dis­ad­van­tages brought about by their par­ents’ mar­i­tal split.</p>
    <p>The study, re­leased yes­ter­day, found that:</p>
    <p>Chil­dren from di­vorced fam­i­lies were less likely to ob­tain a univer­sity de­gree. Only 27.8 per cent of these chil­dren were univer­sity grad­u­ates, com­pared with 37 per cent of chil­dren from in­tact fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>• Chil­dren whose par­ents di­vorced earned less than their peers whose par­ents stayed mar­ried, and these chil­dren had smaller sums in their Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund ac­counts. For ex­am­ple, the av­er­age in­come per­centile rank of chil­dren from di­vorced fam­i­lies was 41.8, lower than the 46.7 for chil­dren whose par­ents stayed to­gether. The higher the in­come, the higher the per­centile rank.</p>
    <p>• Chil­dren whose par­ents went their sep­a­rate ways were also less likely to get mar­ried, with 73.6 per cent of them ty­ing the knot by the time they turned 35. This is com­pared with 75.9 per cent for chil­dren from in­tact fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>• Chil­dren whose par­ents were di­vorced were more likely to be di­vorced them­selves, with 21.7 per cent end­ing their mar­riages by the time they turned 35. This is com­pared with 13.8 per cent for chil­dren whose par­ents stayed wed.</p>
    <p>An MSF spokesman said the dif­fer­ences in the two groups of chil­dren were sta­tis­ti­cally sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>The study ex­am­ined the eco­nomic and mar­riage out­comes of 101,180 Sin­ga­porean chil­dren born be­tween 1979 and 1981 and was based on ag­gre­gated data from mul­ti­ple sources of ad­min­is­tra­tive and sur­vey records.</p>
    <p>The Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics and MSF con­ducted the study.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers found that the par­ents of 8.8 per cent, or 8,880 peo­ple, di­vorced be­fore the child had cel­e­brated his or her 21st birth­day.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that the study was com­par­ing fam­i­lies of sim­i­lar back­grounds, apart from the par­ents’ mar­i­tal sta­tus, chil­dren from di­vorced fam­i­lies were matched with those whose par­ents re­mained mar­ried on a range of de­mo­graphic char­ac­ter­is­tics, such as their par­ents’ ages and their high­est qual­i­fi­ca­tion at the point of mar­riage.</p>
    <p>The study comes as the num­ber of di­vorces has inched up, with 7,330 di­vorces last year, up from 6,990 in 2018.</p>
    <p>Some 55 per cent of di­vorces last year in­volved cou­ples with at least one child un­der 21.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment Masagos Zulkifli said in the study’s me­dia state­ment: “With this land­mark study, we now know that the ef­fects of di­vorce on a child are not tem­po­rary, and im­pact the child’s fu­ture, his ed­u­ca­tion and his fam­ily when he mar­ries. This is why post-di­vorce, pos­i­tive co-par­ent­ing is so im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>So­ci­ol­o­gists and coun­sel­lors in­ter­viewed sug­gested a few fac­tors in di­vorce that af­fected chil­dren neg­a­tively.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity so­ci­ol­o­gist Paulin Straughan said: “With ev­ery mar­riage dis­so­lu­tion, there is a high like­li­hood that the well-be­ing of the fam­ily unit (in terms of fi­nan­cial, so­cial and emo­tional as­sets) is re­duced.”</p>
    <p>The of­ten long-drawn ten­sions in the fam­ily, cou­pled with re­duced fi­nan­cial and emo­tional re­sources as a re­sult of the di­vorce, af­fect the child in dif­fer­ent ways, from do­ing well in school to man­ag­ing re­la­tion­ships and con­flicts, she added.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Jean Ye­ung, found­ing direc­tor of the Cen­tre for Fam­ily and Pop­u­la­tion Re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, cau­tioned that it can­not be con­cluded from the study that di­vorce causes worse out­comes for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause there are many other vari­ables that cause both the di­vorce and the chil­dren to fare worse that can­not be pre­cluded.</p>
    <p>These vari­ables could in­clude per­sonal cir­cum­stances and char­ac­ter­is­tics that lead to greater stress within the fam­ily, for ex­am­ple, lead­ing to the di­vorce and also the child’s lower aca­demic and other achieve­ments.</p>
    <p>Prof Ye­ung ex­plained: “Hence, the lower achieve­ment of the child is not caused by the di­vorce, though it may be ex­ac­er­bated by the di­vorce.”</p>
    <p>The study stated as much, say­ing: “While the re­sults might not strictly in­form us of the causal im­pact of di­vorce, they pro­vide an in­dica­tive sense of chil­dren’s longterm out­comes associated with parental di­vorce, which would in turn help in­form in­ter­ven­tions for chil­dren when cou­ples file for di­vorce.”</p>
    <p>The In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies’ se­nior re­search fel­low Mathew Mathews noted that not ev­ery child who comes from a di­vorced fam­ily is af­fected in the same way.</p>
    <p>He said: “The avail­abil­ity of ad­e­quate sup­port – per­haps from the ex­tended fam­ily and com­mu­nity – can me­di­ate the ex­tent of neg­a­tive ef­fects that chil­dren ex­pe­ri­ence post-di­vorce.”</p>
    <p>The re­port said that to mit­i­gate the neg­a­tive im­pact of di­vorces, ef­forts to help cou­ples build strong mar­riages and in­ter­ven­tions to help chil­dren ad­just to life after their par­ents’ di­vorce are im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>The MSF and its com­mu­nity part­ners run a suite of ser­vices, from mar­riage prepa­ra­tion pro­grammes to help cou­ples pre­pare for their lives to­gether to six di­vorce sup­port agen­cies pro­vid­ing spe­cialised help to cou­ples go­ing their sep­a­rate ways.</p>
    <p>LONG-TERM IM­PACT</p>
    <p>With this land­mark study, we now know that the ef­fects of di­vorce on a child are not tem­po­rary, and im­pact the child’s fu­ture, his ed­u­ca­tion and his fam­ily when he mar­ries. This is why post-di­vorce, pos­i­tive co-par­ent­ing is so im­por­tant. ’’</p>
