    <p>SAV­ING THE EARTH</p>
    <p>The cur­rent pan­demic has al­lowed more than 850 pub­licly listed com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore to be ex­empted from print­ing an­nual re­ports. It has saved Sin­ga­pore an es­ti­mated one bil­lion pages of printed re­ports, which has led to sav­ings on ink and postage.</p>
    <p>At the same time, vir­tual meet­ings and an­nounce­ments have re­sulted in more ef­fec­tive use of man­power and time, as well as cost sav­ings.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change should con­tinue to al­low such ar­range­ments.</p>

    <p>FILTHY MRT STA­TION EX­ITS</p>
    <p>It was men­tioned that as part of the up­com­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal san­i­ta­tion pro­gramme, thor­ough clean­ing of ar­eas that are not eas­ily ac­ces­si­ble has to be car­ried out at least once ev­ery six months (New law to boost hy­giene lev­els in high-risk premises, Oct 6).</p>
    <p>I re­quest that the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­ment look into the clean­li­ness level of MRT sta­tions, specif­i­cally their street-level ex­its.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause when I take the es­ca­la­tor at these ex­its, I al­most al­ways see a thick layer of dust on the sur­round­ing pil­lars and walls.</p>
    <p>While these are not high-touch and high-risk ar­eas, such a filthy con­di­tion is un­sightly and leaves a bad im­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>How of­ten are these ar­eas cleaned, and do the au­thor­i­ties con­duct in­spec­tions?</p>

    <p>WHY THE SER­VICE CHARGE?</p>
    <p>FairPrice charges a ser­vice fee and a de­liv­ery fee for on­line or­ders. This seems quite out of sync with other on­line re­tail­ers such as RedMart, Ama­zon, Gi­ant and Cold Stor­age, as well as smaller in­de­pen­dent on­line grocery ven­dors, which charge only a de­liv­ery fee and waive it be­yond a defined thresh­old.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, it seems some­what of a mis­rep­re­sen­ta­tion to ad­ver­tise only the de­liv­ery fee (free for pur­chases over $79) and not men­tion that a com­pul­sory ser­vice fee of $3.99 al­ways ap­plies.</p>
    <p>Is there a rea­son that FairPrice chooses to bur­den the con­sumer this way?</p>
    <p>Com­par­ing prices of goods over the past sev­eral months, one will find that FairPrice’s pric­ing is on a par with other ven­dors – not sig­nif­i­cantly dis­counted to jus­tify the ex­tra cost.</p>

    <p>SIA COULD FOL­LOW QANTAS’ EX­AM­PLE</p>
    <p>I was dis­ap­pointed that en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists ob­jected to Sin­ga­pore Air­line’s idea of “flights to nowhere” with­out of­fer­ing an al­ter­na­tive pro­posal (En­vi­ron­men­tal groups con­cerned about flights to nowhere, Sept 17).</p>
    <p>What SIA was con­sid­er­ing was no dif­fer­ent from what Aus­tralian air­line Qantas will be do­ing.</p>
    <p>From next month, Qantas will make 12-hour flights that take trav­ellers from Syd­ney, Mel­bourne, Bris­bane, Ade­laide and Perth to view Antarc­tica and then re­turn to Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>SIA could make flights to at­trac­tions such as trop­i­cal beaches and In­done­sian vol­ca­noes.</p>
    <p>A real flight helps keep the air­craft fly­ing and keeps pi­lots, cabin crew and main­te­nance staff em­ployed. In these chal­leng­ing times, we need to think out­side the box.</p>
