    <p>When I ar­rive at Ho­tel Clas­sic by Venue, a staff mem­ber prof­fers a cold towel on a plate.</p>
    <p>I have trav­elled only 20 min­utes from my home in the east and it has not been a tir­ing jour­ney by any means, but the ges­ture re­minds me of sooth­ing re­sort lob­bies and trop­i­cal wel­come drinks from a long­for­got­ten time.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel is among a trio of bou­tique prop­er­ties un­der the Venue brand lo­cated in Joo Chiat. They are run by home-grown com­pany World­wide Ho­tels, which owns and man­ages 38 prop­er­ties in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Ken­neth Seah, sec­tor man­ager for the Venue brand ho­tels, says Joo Chiat’s rep­u­ta­tion as a foodie haunt has en­ticed Sin­ga­pore­ans look­ing to ex­plore new en­claves.</p>
    <p>So it’s cheap, but is it com­fort­able?</p>
    <p>Ho­tel Clas­sic by Venue lives up to its name, of­fer­ing the quin­tes­sen­tial ho­tel ex­pe­ri­ence at a frac­tion of the price.</p>
    <p>My Su­pe­rior Room is un­der­stated and el­e­gant – with walls, floors and a mar­bled head­board in neu­tral shades of light brown and grey. On the wall, sleek black pan­els con­trol ev­ery­thing from the tem­per­a­ture to a “do not dis­turb” but­ton for house­keep­ing.</p>
    <p>The bath­room is shiny and size­able, with thought­ful touches such as hand towels (the only bud­get ho­tel I re­viewed to of­fer this) and an am­ple-sized ledge for toi­letries. It is lovely to lux­u­ri­ate un­der a pow­er­ful rain shower and step out to plush bath towels.</p>
    <p>Over­look­ing an al­ley, my room is gen­er­ally quiet, though I do hear muf­fled chat­ter and other guests re­turn­ing to their rooms at night. Blinds keep the room so dark and cosy, I sleep in till al­most noon.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>Per­anakan cul­ture abounds in Joo Chiat.</p>
    <p>Stop by home mu­seum The In­tan in Joo Chiat Ter­race, lov­ingly cu­rated by Mr Alvin Yapp, who has been col­lect­ing the an­tiques of his her­itage since he was a teenager.</p>
    <p>The shop­house is a trea­sure trove of fur­ni­ture and beaded slip­pers, and a rain­bow of tif­fin car­ri­ers and spit­toons line its stair­case. Vis­its are by ap­point­ment only.</p>
    <p>Learn how Per­anakan ke­bayas and beaded shoes are made at the her­itage gallery of the Rumah Kim Choo shop­house along East Coast Road and stop for a photo in Koon Seng Road, where candy-coloured Per­anakan shop­houses line up gaily in the sun.</p>
    <p>You’ve saved on a stay, now in­dulge in a good meal.</p>
    <p>Viet­namese restau­rants abound. Fol­low the queues and you will wind up at Long Phung Viet­namese Restau­rant along Joo Chiat Road, five min­utes away on foot.</p>
    <p>It is the most well-known Viet­namese out­let in the area and, if you are look­ing for a hearty bowl of pho, it will not dis­ap­point.</p>
    <p>But I take a gam­ble on Lap Viet­namese Restau­rant next door, where staff and pa­trons con­verse in Viet­namese and ev­ery ta­ble seems to have or­dered the same plate of gar­lic-fried cock­les ($7).</p>
    <p>The cock­les are plump and juicy, with chunks of lard and gar­lic mask­ing a slight muddy taste. And my bun thit nuong cha gio ($8), or rice noo­dles topped with grilled pork, fried spring rolls and a gar­den of herbs and greens, bursts with flavour.</p>
    <p>A foodie friend rec­om­mends Malaysian chain You Kee XO at Joo Chiat Place, which she says is one of her favourite char siew joints.</p>
    <p>In­deed, my first bite of the char siew noo­dles ($5.50) is crisp, caramelise­d, unc­tu­ous bliss. The noo­dles are springy and flavour­ful, but rice is best for mop­ping up all the bub­bling, gooey sauce from the Hand­made Sig­na­ture Bean Curd ($8.80).</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: Hid­den gem or bud­get disas­ter?</p>
    <p>Stay a night or two, es­pe­cially if the east is a long trek from home. There are lots to keep you oc­cu­pied and the ho­tel pro­vides a com­fort­able base from which to see and do it all.</p>
