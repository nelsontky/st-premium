    <p>As the of­fi­cial Leader of the Op­po­si­tion (LO), Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh will be given the right of first re­sponse among MPs, have more time to speak in Par­lia­ment and also get con­fi­den­tial brief­ings from the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>He will be paid $385,000 a year – double what other MPs get – and get al­lowances to hire more staff.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are among the priv­i­leges and re­sources he will be ac­corded with the po­lit­i­cal ap­point­ment, a first for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Along with them come du­ties such as lead­ing and or­gan­is­ing the scru­tiny of the Gov­ern­ment’s po­si­tions and ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Th­ese de­tails were an­nounced yes­ter­day af­ter­noon in a state­ment is­sued by the of­fices of Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin and Leader of the House Grace Fu, af­ter the two met Mr Singh ear­lier to give him a run­down of his role.</p>
    <p>Since Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong first an­nounced on July 11 that the Gov­ern­ment would des­ig­nate Mr Singh as the LO, there has been much public in­ter­est in what the role will en­tail.</p>
    <p>The position is not pro­vided for in ei­ther the Con­sti­tu­tion or the Stand­ing Or­ders of Par­lia­ment, said the state­ment, which noted that Sin­ga­pore has never had for­mal LOs even in the 1950s and early 1960s, when there were sub­stan­tial num­bers of op­po­si­tion leg­isla­tive as­sem­bly­men. Mr Lee Kuan Yew, who led the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party as the largest op­po­si­tion party between 1955 and 1959, and Dr Lee Siew Choh, who led Barisan Sosialis as the largest op­po­si­tion party between 1961 and 1963, were never for­mally des­ig­nated as the LO.</p>
    <p>In de­cid­ing on the specifics of the of­fice, the Gov­ern­ment had looked to other West­min­ster par­lia­men­tary sys­tems such as Aus­tralia and Bri­tain, which have for­mally des­ig­nated op­po­si­tion, and also con­sid­ered Sin­ga­pore’s cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh’s du­ties as the LO in­clude lead­ing the op­po­si­tion in pre­sent­ing al­ter­na­tive views in par­lia­men­tary de­bates on poli­cies, Bills and mo­tions. He will also lead and or­gan­ise the scru­tiny of the Gov­ern­ment’s po­si­tions and ac­tions.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, he will be con­sulted on the ap­point­ment of op­po­si­tion MPs to Se­lect Com­mit­tees, in­clud­ing Stand­ing Se­lect Com­mit­tees like the Public Ac­counts Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion to his par­lia­men­tary du­ties, the LO may be called upon to take on other du­ties such as at­tend­ing of­fi­cial state func­tions and tak­ing part in vis­its and meet­ings along­side mem­bers of the Gov­ern­ment and the Public Ser­vice,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>To en­sure he can ful­fil his du­ties, Mr Singh will be ac­corded cer­tain priv­i­leges and pro­vided with more re­sources. In Par­lia­ment, he will get leges and re­mu­ner­a­tion ex­tended to Sin­ga­pore’s Leader of the Op­po­si­tion as out­lined in the joint press re­lease largely fol­lows the spirit of the con­ven­tion to­wards the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion as prac­tised by the UK Par­lia­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added: “Mem­bers of the public would be aware that the for­mal des­ig­na­tion of an LO is a new one the right of first re­sponse among MPs, and have the right to ask the lead ques­tion to min­is­ters on poli­cies, Bills and mo­tions, sub­ject to exin Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal his­tory.”</p>
    <p>He also said he would ex­tend his sup­port to the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party’s two Non-Con­stituency MPs, given the staff and re­sources he will have.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment will re­open on Aug 24 with the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, and the de­bate on it will start a week later, on Aug 31. ist­ing speak­ing con­ven­tions.</p>
    <p>He will also have more time for his speeches, equiv­a­lent to that given to po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh was ap­pointed to the role af­ter the WP made his­toric gains in the July 10 polls, win­ning 10 par­lia­men­tary seats and its sec­ond group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency.</p>
    <p>In a sub­se­quent post last night, he said he would al­lo­cate 50 per cent of his $385,000 an­nual salary, af­ter taxes, for four pur­poses – the first of which is to help low-in­come resi</p>
    <p>All MPs are al­lowed to speak for 20 min­utes in re­sponse to ques­tions raised, and up to 10 min­utes when Par­lia­ment sits as a com­mit­tee, like dents in Hougang SMC, Alju­nied GRC and Sengkang GRC through the WP Com­mu­nity Fund or the WP Grass­roots Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>His salary will also go to­wards fund­ing com­mu­nity pro­grammes in WP-held con­stituen­cies, char­i­ta­ble or wor­thy causes, as well as WP spe­cific needs, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh wrote on Face­book that when de­lib­er­at­ing on the con­tents of a Bill, ac­cord­ing to the Stand­ing Or­ders of Par­lia­ment. Min­is­ters and par­lia­men­tary sec­re­taries are en­ti­tled to speak for up to 40 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh will also re­ceive con­fi­den­tial brief­ings by the Gov­ern­ment on “se­lect mat­ters of na­tional se­cu­rity and ex­ter­nal re­la­tions, and in the event of a na­tional cri­sis or emer­gency”, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>The con­tent of th­ese brief­ings can­not be dis­closed to oth­ers, in­clud­ing other op­po­si­tion MPs, said the Of­fices of the Speaker and Leader of the House when asked.</p>
    <p>They de­clined to say if the LO will also get ad­vance pol­icy brief­ings.</p>
    <p>As for staff sup­port, he will re­ceive ad­di­tional al­lowance to hire up to three ad­di­tional leg­isla­tive as­sis­tants, on top of the al­lowance all MPs re­ceive to hire one leg­isla­tive as­sis­tant and a sec­re­tar­ial as­sis­tant.</p>
    <p>He will also be pro­vided a sec­re­tary to sup­port him ad­min­is­tra­tively with par­lia­men­tary busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The sec­re­tary and as­sis­tants will not be em­ployed as public of­fi­cers, said the Of­fices of the Speaker and Leader of the House.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh will have an of­fice and the use of a meet­ing room in Par­lia­ment House as well.</p>
    <p>Not­ing PM Lee’s ac­knowl­edge­ment that the re­cent elec­tion re­sults showed a strong de­sire among Sin­ga­pore­ans for a greater di­ver­sity of views in pol­i­tics, and that this trend is here to stay, the state­ment said: “Des­ig­nat­ing a Leader of Op­po­si­tion will recog­nise this de­sire while en­abling our po­lit­i­cal sys­tem to evolve in a way that main­tains our sense of na­tional pur­pose.”</p>
    <p>It added that as with any new po­lit­i­cal ap­point­ment, the role of the LO will evolve as Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal sys­tem evolves. “We look for­ward to work­ing with the LO to cre­ate a ro­bust but sta­ble po­lit­i­cal sys­tem serv­ing the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Ms Fu will de­liver a state­ment in Par­lia­ment to for­mally set out the terms of the LO. it is a priv­i­lege to be ap­pointed as the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“While I am grate­ful to re­ceive the ad­di­tional sup­port and re­mu­ner­a­tion that comes with the ti­tle of Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, the ap­point­ment will re­quire more in­vest­ment of my time and longer hours away from my fam­ily,” he said.</p>
    <p>Af­ter putting his daugh­ters to bed, he said he dis­cussed the ap­point­ment with his wife, in­clud­ing what the salary in­crease would mean to their fam­ily, among other things.</p>
    <p>“Both of us felt strongly that a per­cent­age of the salary should be used for a greater pur­pose,” he said.</p>
    <p>The LO ap­point­ment car­ries with it many ad­di­tional re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, he added.</p>
    <p>“The road ahead will not be easy, but I thank Sin­ga­pore­ans for their sup­port and en­cour­age­ment.”</p>
    <p>NEW DES­IG­NA­TION</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the public would be aware that the for­mal des­ig­na­tion of an LO is a new one in Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal his­tory. ’’</p>
