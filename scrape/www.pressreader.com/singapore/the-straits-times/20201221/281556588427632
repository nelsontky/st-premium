    <p>Re­gard­less of their own in­come and ed­u­ca­tional lev­els, par­ents pro­vid­ing learn­ing ac­tiv­i­ties at home can have a ma­jor in­flu­ence in de­vel­op­ing their young chil­dren’s maths and lan­guage skills. This was borne out by Sin­ga­pore’s first kin­der­garten study, which fol­lowed 1,537 chil­dren from 80 pre-schools.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of their own in­come and ed­u­ca­tional lev­els, par­ents pro­vid­ing learn­ing ac­tiv­i­ties at home can have a ma­jor in­flu­ence on de­vel­op­ing their young chil­dren’s maths and lan­guage skills.</p>
    <p>This was borne out by Sin­ga­pore’s first kin­der­garten study which fol­lowed 1,537 chil­dren from 80 pre-schools from Kin­der­garten 1 to Pri­mary 1. The study un­der­scored the im­por­tance of preschool ed­u­ca­tion – as well as the role that par­ents can play.</p>
    <p>It found that in kin­der­garten, chil­dren from less af­flu­ent homes progress at the same rate as their peers from more af­flu­ent homes. But there is a gap in skills be­tween chil­dren from the dif­fer­ent in­come groups when they en­ter K1, and it re­mains when they are in P1.</p>
    <p>Called the Sin­ga­pore Kin­der­garten Im­pact Project (Skip), the study tracked the chil­dren from 2015, when they en­tered kin­der­garten, till July 2017, seven months af­ter they en­rolled in Pri­mary 1.</p>
    <p>Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion re­search sci­en­tist Ng Ee Lynn, who led the study, said it af­firmed the on­go­ing ef­forts to im­prove ac­ces­si­bil­ity, af­ford­abil­ity and qual­ity of pre-school ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“We are on the right track. Good qual­ity pre-school ed­u­ca­tion is im­por­tant. The Skip study showed that the two years in kin­der­garten raised the lan­guage, maths and other skills such as the abil­ity to fo­cus, which are im­por­tant to learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>The early ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem has seen sig­nif­i­cant changes in re­cent years, in­clud­ing a spruced up cur­ricu­lum and bet­ter train­ing for pre-school ed­u­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>She added: “The other sig­nif­i­cant find­ing is that what par­ents do with their chil­dren at home mat­ters. De­spite their ed­u­ca­tion or in­come level, if they pro­vided op­por­tu­ni­ties for chil­dren to learn, be it count­ing games or singing rhyming songs, it helps to build a child’s lit­er­acy and nu­mer­acy skills.”</p>
    <p>The study also found that read­ing books in the mother tongue lan­guage at home con­trib­utes to chil­dren’s level of vo­cab­u­lary at K1.</p>
    <p>In terms of ex­ec­u­tive func­tion­ing skills that are cru­cial for learn­ing, such as the abil­ity to pay at­ten­tion and jug­gle mul­ti­ple tasks, the team found that while chil­dren from lower-in­come fam­i­lies may en­ter K1 with lower ex­ec­u­tive func­tion­ing skills – as well as lower lit­er­acy and nu­mer­acy skills – they went on to im­prove on these skills at the same rate as their peers from K1 to P1.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Ng: “Given the im­por­tance of the home en­vi­ron­ment in chil­dren’s de­vel­op­men­tal out­comes, ex­ist­ing gov­ern­ment pro­grammes such as KidS­tart to strengthen parental ed­u­ca­tion and sup­port for chil­dren from dis­ad­van­taged homes will be im­por­tant to level the play­ing field.”</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion and the Early Child­hood De­vel­op­ment Agency said the Gov­ern­ment pro­vides tar­geted sup­port for chil­dren from lower-in­come fam­i­lies to have a good start in life and will con­tinue to ex­plore ways to nar­row the per­for­mance gap be­tween chil­dren from lower-in­come fam­i­lies and their peers.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Poh Wah, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Lien Foun­da­tion, which seeded the Cir­cle of Care pro­gramme that pro­vides all-round sup­port for dis­ad­van­taged chil­dren and their fam­i­lies, said that in clos­ing the gap, the au­thor­i­ties must re­mem­ber that “ed­u­ca­tional prob­lems can­not be solved by schools alone just as health prob­lems can­not be solved solely by hos­pi­tals”.</p>
    <p>He added: “To bet­ter meet the com­plex needs of chil­dren and fam­i­lies, the pro­fes­sional bound­aries be­tween the pre-school, early in­ter­ven­tion and pri­mary school sys­tems need to be more por­ous and bridged with other care pro­fes­sions.”</p>
