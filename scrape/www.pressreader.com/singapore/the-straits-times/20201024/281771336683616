    <p>A Mex­i­can restau­rant in Cir­cu­lar Road has been is­sued an or­der to close its premises for 20 days af­ter breach­ing Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures mul­ti­ple times.</p>
    <p>The Ur­ban Rede­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (URA) told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that this is the long­est clo­sure it has is­sued to a food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­let so far.</p>
    <p>The Los Ami­gos restau­rant was or­dered to close from Thurs­day to Nov 10.</p>
    <p>The URA said that on Oct 10, its of­fi­cers saw dif­fer­ent groups of cus­tomers at the restau­rant standing less than 1m apart from one an­other, and a gath­er­ing of eight peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Since phase two of Covid-19 mea­sures be­gan on June 19, groups have been re­quired to keep a dis­tance of at least 1m from one an­other in public, and gath­er­ings of more than five are not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>This is the se­cond time Los Ami­gos has been taken to task. It was pre­vi­ously fined $1,000 and or­dered to close for 10 days in July for hav­ing gath­er­ings of more than five on its premises.</p>
    <p>“De­spite this, we con­tinue to ob­serve re­peated, mul­ti­ple breaches of safe man­age­ment mea­sures. The op­er­a­tor has been in­formed that this is un­ac­cept­able,” said the URA.</p>
    <p>An­other F&B out­let, Kan­pai 789, was fined $2,000 for not en­sur­ing that cus­tomers from dif­fer­ent groups stood at least 1m apart</p>
    <p>from one an­other.</p>
    <p>The eatery in Robert­son Walk was pre­vi­ously fined $1,000 dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in April when staff were found not to be wear­ing masks prop­erly.</p>
    <p>Two other F&B out­lets – Fo­rum</p>
    <p>Seafood Vil­lage Restau­rant in Boat Quay and Xiang Sig­na­ture in Liang Seah Street – were each fined $1,000 for ad­mit­ting groups of more than five into their premises.</p>
    <p>Thir­teen in­di­vid­u­als were also fined $300 each for gath­er­ing in</p>
    <p>groups of more than five in the Boat Quay area.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­ity urged pa­trons to be so­cially re­spon­si­ble and ob­serve the Covid-19 rules, which in­clude mask­ing up when they are not eat­ing or drink­ing.</p>
    <p>The URA re­it­er­ated that it will not hes­i­tate to take en­force­ment ac­tion against both pa­trons and op­er­a­tors who do not com­ply with safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
