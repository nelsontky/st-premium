    <p>A week-long se­ries of ground-up ini­tia­tives to raise aware­ness of the long-term ex­is­ten­tial chal­lenge posed by cli­mate change is un­der way.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate Ac­tion Week, or­gan­ised by the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE), kicked off on Satur­day with an on­line talk on ur­ban farm­ing by Ms Danielle Chan, an alumna of the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore who co-founded the ur­ban farm­ing com­pany Ci­tipon­ics.</p>
    <p>Other events that will run till Aug 21 as part of the ini­tia­tive in­clude we­bi­nars, panel dis­cus­sions, work­shops and even a vir­tual “Youth4Cli­mate” con­cert by real es­tate giant City De­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>Many of the ac­tiv­i­ties are be­ing con­ducted vir­tu­ally and are open to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The 30 ini­tia­tives or­gan­ised by 27 part­ners from the peo­ple, pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tors are aimed at build­ing broader pub­lic aware­ness of key is­sues in sus­tain­abil­ity and cli­mate change, the min­istry said in a state­ment on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous pri­mary schools, se­condary schools and ju­nior col­leges are among the or­gan­is­ers, as are cof­fee pro­ducer Ne­spresso and non­govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the World Wide Fund for Na­ture Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>MSE said cli­mate change is a long-term ex­is­ten­tial chal­lenge for Sin­ga­pore, and it must press on with sus­tain­abil­ity ef­forts even as it ad­dresses the im­me­di­ate is­sues posed by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Gal­vanis­ing a whole-of-na­tion ef­fort will be a key de­ter­mi­nant of Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess in mit­i­gat­ing and adapt­ing to the chal­lenges posed by cli­mate change,” it added.</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond edi­tion of Cli­mate Ac­tion Week, which was ini­ti­ated last year fol­low­ing the suc­cess of the Year of Cli­mate Ac­tion cam­paign in 2018, which saw about 800 cli­mate ac­tion-re­lated events ini­ti­ated and or­gan­ised here.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu said in a</p>
    <p>Face­book post on Satur­day night: “A sus­tain­able na­tion is a re­silient one, and we can all do our part in this long-term en­deav­our.”</p>
    <p>She en­cour­aged the pub­lic to take part in the ac­tiv­i­ties and hoped par­tic­i­pants will find them en­rich­ing.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion on the ac­tiv­i­ties can be found on the MSE’s cli­mategamech­anger.sg web­site.</p>
