    <p>A 66-year-old man, who killed his men­tally ill adult daugh­ter in 2018 af­ter she pointed a knife at him, was re­leased from prison yes­ter­day, the day he was sen­tenced to two years and nine months in jail.</p>
    <p>In sen­tenc­ing Tan Tian Chye yes­ter­day, High Court judge Hoo Sheau Peng noted that he had been a “self­less, lov­ing and de­voted fa­ther” who tire­lessly cared for his de­mand­ing daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>The judge back­dated the sen­tence to Nov 20, 2018, the day Tan was re­manded in cus­tody. Given the usual one-third re­mis­sion for good be­hav­iour, Tan was re­leased from prison yes­ter­day evening.</p>
    <p>This was a tragic case, said Jus­tice Hoo, which serves as a stark re­minder of the im­por­tance of be­ing alert to the men­tal health of fam­ily mem­bers and seek­ing timely treat­ment. She noted that Tan and his wife had been on the verge of sui­cide as their daugh­ter be­came in­creas­ingly un­rea­son­able.</p>
    <p>Tan’s daugh­ter, Ms De­siree Tan Ji­ap­ing, 35, had scolded her par­ents in­ces­santly, con­stantly found fault with them and even made them bow be­fore her.</p>
    <p>The un­em­ployed woman also told her par­ents to trans­fer their money to her and even told her fa­ther, a pri­vate-hire driver, that he needed to drive more fre­quently to earn more money.</p>
    <p>Tan and his wife did what­ever they could to pacify their daugh­ter, who was di­ag­nosed with a men­tal disor­der but re­fused treat­ment. Once, he slapped his wife in front of their daugh­ter to ap­pease her.</p>
    <p>On Nov 19, 2018, Ms Tan told her fa­ther that she felt like killing him and then pointed a knife at him. The pair had a con­fronta­tion in the kitchen of their Be­dok South flat, which ended with Tan stran­gling his daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>A psy­chi­atric as­sess­ment found that Tan was suf­fer­ing from a ma­jor de­pres­sive episode and sig­nif­i­cant care­giver stress, which sub­stan­tially im­paired his re­spon­si­bil­ity for his acts in killing his daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Tan had pleaded guilty to a re­duced charge of cul­pa­ble homi­cide.</p>
    <p>Af­ter he was sen­tenced yes­ter­day, he thanked the judge, the prose­cu­tors and his lawyers. “May God bless all of you,” he added.</p>
    <p>The court had heard that Ms Tan could not hold on to a full-time job af­ter grad­u­at­ing from univer­sity in 2006 and de­pended on her par­ents to pro­vide for her. The name of her univer­sity was not men­tioned in court.</p>
    <p>In 2012, she was taken to Changi Gen­eral Hospi­tal (CGH) af­ter she fainted at an MRT sta­tion. She was as­sessed to have panic at­tacks with ago­ra­pho­bia – a con­di­tion which made her anx­ious in un­fa­mil­iar en­vi­ron­ments – and “hypochon­dri­a­cal</p>
    <p>A psy­chi­atric as­sess­ment found that Tan was suf­fer­ing from a ma­jor de­pres­sive episode and sig­nif­i­cant care­giver stress, which sub­stan­tially im­paired his re­spon­si­bil­ity for his acts in killing his daugh­ter. Tan had pleaded guilty to a re­duced charge of cul­pa­ble homi­cide.</p>
    <p>Af­ter he was sen­tenced yes­ter­day, he thanked the judge, the prose­cu­tors and his lawyers. “May God bless all of you,” he added.</p>
    <p>pre­oc­cu­pa­tions”.</p>
    <p>From then on, she be­came very anx­ious about leav­ing the flat on her own and her boyfriend moved into the flat to live with her. She also be­came more par­tic­u­lar, and would ask her par­ents to clean items re­peat­edly un­til she was sat­is­fied.</p>
    <p>Tan would take time off from work to take her out to help her over­come her anx­i­ety. He also bought a sec­ond-hand car, which he al­lowed her boyfriend to use to take her out.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Ms Tan told her par­ents that she wanted to ap­ply for a Build-To-Or­der flat with her boyfriend. She pestered her par­ents to bor­row money from rel­a­tives and made her younger brother re­turn $50,000 her par­ents had spent on his ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“The de­ceased be­came more in­sis­tent and abu­sive, and blamed the ac­cused and his wife for not lov­ing her and not pro­vid­ing enough for her,” Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Bha­jan­vir Singh told the court.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan also be­came up­set upon find­ing out that she was not the sole ben­e­fi­ciary of her mother’s Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund monies and scolded her par­ents un­til her mother changed the nom­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>In mid-2018, Ms Tan started to com­plain about the smell of cig­a­rette smoke in the flat and de­manded that her par­ents find the cul­prit. She also made them buy pow­er­ful fans and use card­board to fan away the smoke.</p>
    <p>On Oct 22 that year, Tan took her to CGH. She was di­ag­nosed with un­spec­i­fied anx­i­ety disor­der but de­clined med­i­ca­tion, and in­stead moved to her aunt’s place to es­cape the smoke.</p>
    <p>On Nov 19, 2018, af­ter Tan picked her up from the aunt’s place, she told him over lunch that she felt like killing him with a fork.</p>
    <p>She con­tin­ued scold­ing and curs­ing him on the way home.</p>
    <p>Upon reach­ing home, she went to the kitchen. Tan picked up a metal pole to arm him­self out of fear that she would harm him.</p>
    <p>In the kitchen, when he saw her point­ing a knife at him, he hit her with the pole and af­ter she fell to the floor, he grabbed a cloth and stran­gled her with it.</p>
    <p>Tan then called the po­lice to re­port that he had killed his daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times went to Changi Prison Com­plex yes­ter­day evening, a grey-haired Tan walked out of the prison gate clutch­ing a bag of his be­long­ings, wear­ing a red polo T-shirt and flip-flops.</p>
    <p>He and a woman, who looked to be in her 50s, ex­changed an emo­tional hug at the gate as Tan wiped tears from his eyes.</p>
    <p>They did not re­spond to ques­tions from The Straits Times and left soon af­ter in a car.</p>
