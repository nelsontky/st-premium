    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic, a newly elected pres­i­dent of the United States and chang­ing power re­la­tions in the re­gion are among the sea of changes that hap­pened this year, af­fect­ing life as we know it.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic, in par­tic­u­lar, has changed how we live, in­tro­duc­ing con­cepts such as so­cial dis­tanc­ing and in­creas­ing the use of tech­nol­ogy at work.</p>
    <p>The world is also set to feel the rip­ples emit­ted in a change of ad­min­is­tra­tion in its largest econ­omy, rais­ing the ques­tion of how trade ten­sions be­tween the US and China will play out in the new year.</p>
    <p>Shin­ing a spot­light on th­ese prom­i­nent top­ics is The Straits Times Global Out­look Fo­rum to be held online on Jan 11.</p>
    <p>Ti­tled Asia And Asean: The Way For­ward?, the an­nual con­fer­ence is or­gan­ised by The Straits Times in part­ner­ship with pre­sent­ing spon­sor OCBC Pre­mier Bank­ing.</p>
    <p>The key­note speaker will be Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee</p>
    <p>Keat, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter and Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng will also be tak­ing ques­tions from au­di­ence mem­bers in a 45-minute live seg­ment mod­er­ated by Mr War­ren Fer­nan­dez, ed­i­tor-in-chief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ Eng­lish/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group and ed­i­tor of ST.</p>
    <p>A panel dis­cus­sion mod­er­ated by ST’s US bureau chief Nir­mal Ghosh, who is based in Wash­ing­ton, fol­lows the ques­tion-and-an­swer seg­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Ghosh took up his as­sign­ment in Wash­ing­ton in 2016 and hosts the pa­per’s ST Asian In­sider video se­ries that show­cases an Asian per­spec­tive on global talk­ing points of the week.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants in the panel in­clude OCBC trea­sury re­search and strat­egy head Se­lena Ling, who is also a mem­ber of the OCBC Wealth Panel, ST as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Ravi Vel­loor, ST China bureau chief Tan Dawn Wei and Caixin Me­dia deputy manag­ing ed­i­tor Huang Shan.</p>
    <p>Caixin Me­dia runs China busi­ness and fi­nan­cial news out­lets Caixin.com, Caix­inGlobal.com and Caixin Weekly, among other pub­li­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous ti­tles of the one-day an­nual fo­rum in­clude The Road Ahead: Life Af­ter Brexit For Britain And The EU in 2016 and 2017’s Fac­ing The Chal­lenges Of A New World Or­der af­ter the US elected Mr Don­ald Trump to be its pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Last year, the ti­tle was Nav­i­gat­ing A World In Con­flict, which dis­cussed the grow­ing trade ten­sions be­tween the US and China, the diplo­matic spat be­tween Ja­pan and South Korea over wartime labour, and the con­flict be­tween Pak­istan and In­dia over Kash­mir.</p>
