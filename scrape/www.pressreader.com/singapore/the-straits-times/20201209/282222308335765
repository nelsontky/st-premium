    <p>SIX Dig­i­tal Ex­change and SBI Dig­i­tal As­set Hold­ings plan to cre­ate an ex­change for dig­i­tal as­sets that is based in Sin­ga­pore and will start oper­a­tion by 2022.</p>
    <p>The plan, which is sub­ject to reg­u­la­tory ap­proval from the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, sees for­malised Sin­ga­pore op­er­a­tions next year, with the goal of launch­ing ac­tive of­fer­ings by 2022 at the lat­est, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Con­nec­tiv­ity to Swiss and Ja­panese busi­nesses as well as other part­ner­ships are ex­pected to fol­low. The joint ven­ture’s is­suance, ex­change and CSD plat­forms are ex­pected to be fully reg­u­lated by ex­ist­ing Sin­ga­pore law.</p>
    <p>“Our reach as soon as we go live will be across the whole of South­east Asia, and we ex­pect to have mar­ket par­tic­i­pants from across the re­gion as soon as we launch,” said Mr Tim Grant, head of SDX. “The real play is global liq­uid­ity. That’s what the in­sti­tu­tional mar­ket wants. It doesn’t want to trade 9am to 4pm in its own mar­ket then go to the next and the next.”</p>
    <p>This is all hap­pen­ing at a time when the world of crypto and dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies is com­ing of age. Bit­coin just sur­passed its De­cem­ber 2017 record high. Com­pa­nies like Mi­croS­trat­egy and Square are em­brac­ing crypto, and it is win­ning fans like Mr Paul Tu­dor Jones and Mr Stan Druck­en­miller.</p>
    <p>How­ever the space is still volatile. That late 2017 peak saw a spate of growth plans that never came to fruition. And there are still strug­gles with le­gal and reg­u­la­tory is­sues. The founders of crypto trad­ing gi­ant BitMEX re­signed from their roles with the oper­a­tion after be­ing charged by the United States au­thor­i­ties with skirt­ing laws pre­vent­ing money laun­der­ing, in one ex­am­ple. De­cen­tralised fi­nance or DeFi, a re­cent boom, has had its share of con­tro­ver­sies too.</p>
    <p>SDX and SBI are out­lin­ing some big plans for the new oper­a­tion, how­ever. “We’re try­ing to dis­rupt our­selves,” Mr Fer­nando Vazquez Cao, chief ex­ec­u­tive of SBI Dig­i­tal As­set Hold­ings, said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The ex­change plans to of­fer eq­uity – both listed shares and pri­vate place­ments – as well as debt in­stru­ments, fund struc­tures and struc­tured prod­ucts, said Mr Grant. The ven­ture will be look­ing at crypto as­sets and even “non­bank­able” as­sets like real es­tate and art, he said.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, a ven­ture was an­nounced on Mon­day in which SIX Dig­i­tal Ex­change, Swiss­com and Sygnum Bank will en­able Swiss banks to of­fer ac­cess to dig­i­tal as­sets for their cus­tomers through an in­sti­tu­tional dig­i­tal as­set gate­way.</p>
    <p>An ini­tial joint ser­vice, based on the al­ready avail­able Custo digit plat­form, is tar­geted to start in the first quar­ter of next year with plans to add “sig­nif­i­cant ca­pa­bil­i­ties” through­out the year, ac­cord­ing to a re­lease.</p>
