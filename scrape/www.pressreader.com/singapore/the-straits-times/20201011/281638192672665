    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic, which has been de­scribed as a cri­sis of a gen­er­a­tion, can also be an “op­por­tu­nity of a gen­er­a­tion”, with Sin­ga­pore turn­ing dis­rup­tions caused by the coro­n­avirus into op­por­tu­ni­ties, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He noted the world is fac­ing many chal­lenges, in­clud­ing geopo­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty be­cause of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore re­mains a “safe har­bour” due to its sta­bil­ity and fore­sight, which makes it at­trac­tive to in­vestors and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>A re­port in June by the In­sti­tute for Man­age­ment De­vel­op­ment placed Sin­ga­pore at the top of its world com­pet­i­tive­ness rank­ing.</p>
    <p>The Swiss think-tank noted that the fac­tors be­hind Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess in­clude its ro­bust in­ter­na­tional trade and in­vest­ment poli­cies, and em­ploy­ment and labour market mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion com­mu­nity sem­i­nar, Mr Chan, who is deputy chair­man of PA, said: “If we demon­strate to the world that we still have the guts to think long-term, plan longterm and do things with a longterm per­spec­tive, we will stand out amongst the rest of the world as a shin­ing red dot.”</p>
    <p>“And be­cause we can stand out as a shin­ing red dot, more peo­ple will come here to put their in­vest­ment (and cre­ate) bet­ter jobs for our peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“So we need to watch the changes around the world closely, even as we fight Covid-19 lo­cally.”</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nity sem­i­nar yes­ter­day was held with 1,500 staff and vol­un­teers spread out in 150 lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Some had also at­tended the dis­cus­sion on video con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said as PA adapts to a Covid-19 world, com­mu­nity build­ing work must con­tinue un­der safe man­age­ment mea­sures, es­pe­cially re­duc­ing group size and the den­sity, in­ten­sity and du­ra­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But it is an op­por­tu­nity to re­model op­er­a­tions and meth­ods in car­ry­ing out its mis­sion.</p>
    <p>He noted some com­mu­nity cen­tres have sig­nif­i­cantly in­creased the num­ber par­tic­i­pat­ing in their ac­tiv­i­ties by go­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Chan high­lighted the ef­forts of PA staff and vol­un­teers, which in­cluded de­liv­er­ing es­sen­tial items and food to over 5,000 peo­ple un­der quar­an­tine and on stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, PA said that more than 40,000 staff and vol­un­teers were in­volved in the three maskcol­lec­tion ex­er­cises, with 109 com­mu­nity cen­tres and 661 res­i­dents’ com­mit­tee cen­tres mo­bilised as col­lec­tion cen­tres.</p>
    <p>PA is cur­rently in­volved in the dis­tri­bu­tion of the TraceTo­gether to­ken.</p>
    <p>About 1,900 vol­un­teers and staff have been roped in to distribute 96,000 to­kens in Jalan Be­sar and Tan­jong Pa­gar.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing PA staff and vol­un­teers, Mr Chan said: “It’s not just about us as in­di­vid­u­als, it’s about us as a com­mu­nity com­ing to­gether.</p>
    <p>“And now, even to­day, as we speak, blood do­na­tion drives con­tinue, on­line cour­ses con­tinue, di­a­logues con­tinue to keep our res­i­dents posted and en­gaged.”</p>
    <p>“For all these ef­forts, this is why I say that with­out your con­tri­bu­tions, with­out your ef­forts, Sin­ga­pore to­day, eight months into Covid-19, will be a very dif­fer­ent Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the me­dia af­ter the sem­i­nar, Mr Chan said PA staff and vol­un­teers had dis­cussed how they plan to fur­ther help Sin­ga­pore­ans amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They also dis­cussed ac­tiv­i­ties that can be held in phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, which will al­low for larger groups, among other things.</p>
    <p>Some PA events, in­clud­ing the an­nual Chin­gay Pa­rade, could con­tinue but they may be smaller in scale or take a dif­fer­ent for­mat, he added.</p>
