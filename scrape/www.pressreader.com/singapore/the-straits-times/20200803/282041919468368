    <p>When Mr Mo­hamad Farhan Mohd Fadil was con­sid­er­ing a ca­reer switch, the bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try ap­pealed to him as he felt pro­duc­ing medicine makes a dif­fer­ence in peo­ple’s lives. The in­dus­try is still go­ing strong dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, he said.</p>
    <p>So af­ter 15 years in the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force where he was last a po­lice academy course man­ager, he de­cided to make a bold move last year. Mr Farhan, 38, signed up for the At­tach and Train Pro­gramme for Bi­o­log­ics Man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter two months of train­ing at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic, he is now about a year into an 18-month at­tach­ment as a man­u­fac­tur­ing biotech­nol­o­gist trainee at Roche Sin­ga­pore Tech­ni­cal Op­er­a­tions (RSTO).</p>
    <p>He is in the team sup­port­ing pro­duc­tion of Lu­cen­tis, a medicine for pa­tients with an eye dis­or­der called wet age-re­lated mac­u­lar de­gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“There was a lot to read up on and digest be­cause the bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try is very strict on SOPs (stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures), but I have good col­leagues to guide me and ev­ery­one works with a buddy,” he said.</p>
    <p>Although the train­ing al­lowance rep­re­sents a pay cut of about 30 per cent for him, and a per­ma­nent job is not guar­an­teed, Mr Farhan said he be­lieves the ca­reer switch will lead him to bet­ter prospects.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of six-year-old twins added that his wife has been sup­port­ive and ar­ranges her nurs­ing shifts around his shifts.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully I will be able to earn more in the fu­ture. And it’s im­por­tant to equip my­self with new skills to stay rel­e­vant so that I can be in de­mand and have a bet­ter job,” he said.</p>
    <p>RSTO head of man­u­fac­tur­ing Tracy Lo said that the firm has taken in 141 trainees so far through the pro­gramme, and hired 46 of the 89 trainees who have com­pleted their on-the-job train­ing.</p>
    <p>“Em­bark­ing on the man­power pro­gramme... has en­abled RSTO to build our tal­ent pipe­line and aug­ment our tal­ent ac­qui­si­tion strat­egy where we can ex­pand our hir­ing pipe­line be­yond the con­ven­tional sources,” she said.</p>
