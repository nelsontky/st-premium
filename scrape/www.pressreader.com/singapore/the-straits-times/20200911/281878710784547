    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • The av­er­age size of wildlife pop­u­la­tions has plum­meted by two-thirds world­wide since 1970 as forests were felled to grow food, the World Wide Fund for Na­ture (WWF) said yes­ter­day, warn­ing that harm­ing ecosys­tems hikes the risk to hu­mans of in­fec­tious dis­eases like Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Land con­ver­sion for farm­ing and wildlife trade were key rea­sons for the 68 per cent av­er­age drop across thou­sands of pop­u­la­tions of mam­mals, birds, am­phib­ians, rep­tiles and fish be­tween 1970 and 2016, ac­cord­ing to WWF’s Liv­ing Planet Re­port 2020.</p>
    <p>“De­for­esta­tion and in the larger sense, habi­tat loss – which is driven by how we pro­duce and con­sume food – is the main cause of this dra­matic de­cline,” said Ms Fran Price, leader of the global for­est prac­tice at WWF In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Ms Price pointed the fin­ger at large-scale com­mer­cial agri­cul­ture mainly in the trop­ics and sub-trop­ics, in­clud­ing the pro­duc­tion of palm oil, soy and beef.</p>
    <p>Last year, trop­i­cal rain­forests – whose preser­va­tion is con­sid­ered cru­cial to curb­ing cli­mate change – dis­ap­peared at a rate of one foot­ball pitch every six sec­onds, ac­cord­ing to data from mon­i­tor­ing ser­vice Global For­est Watch.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal­ists say conserving ex­ist­ing forests and restor­ing dam­aged ones re­duces the risk of flood­ing, helps limit global warm­ing by stor­ing more car­bon and pro­tects bio­di­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>The WWF re­port, with con­tri­bu­tions from about 125 ex­perts, tracked al­most 21,000 pop­u­la­tions of nearly 4,400 ver­te­brate species, giv­ing an over­view of the state of the nat­u­ral world.</p>
    <p>Those that live in fresh­wa­ter suf­fered an 84 per cent de­cline, it noted. Other worst-hit wildlife in­cluded East­ern low­land gorillas in the Demo­cratic Repub­lic of Congo and the African grey par­rot i n Ghana, said Ms Price.</p>
    <p>WWF di­rec­tor-gen­eral Marco</p>
    <p>Lam­ber­tini said in a state­ment: “These se­ri­ous de­clines in wildlife species pop­u­la­tions are an in­di­ca­tor that na­ture is un­rav­el­ling and that our planet is flash­ing red warn­ing signs of sys­tems fail­ure.”</p>
    <p>FOR­EST BUF­FERS</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists say the rapid pace of de­for­esta­tion is also a ma­jor fac­tor in the spread of zoonotic dis­eases – which are passed from an­i­mals to hu­mans – such as the coro­n­avirus caus­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“With de­for­esta­tion and in­creased wildlife, live­stock-hu­man in­ter­ac­tions, there is more of a chance of spillover of zoonotic dis­eases like Ebola, like Covid-19,” Ms Price told the Thom­son Reuters Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“Forests re­ally act as buf­fers to keep those dis­eases away from hu­mans – and the more we de­stroy them, the more chances there are that we are go­ing to un­leash some­thing that can have dire im­pacts on hu­man­ity.”</p>
    <p>If the world con­tin­ues with busi­ness as usual over the next decade, the losses in wildlife would take decades to re­v­erse and pop­u­la­tions are less likely to be re­vived, she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Price urged bolder com­mit­ments and ef­forts by govern­ments and cor­po­ra­tions to make global sup­ply chains more sus­tain­able. Con­sumers also need to un­der­stand the im­pact of their pur­chas­ing habits on na­ture and buy more re­spon­si­bly, she added.</p>
    <p>The WWF re­port in­cluded 20 es­says by ex­perts from China to Mexico, writ­ing on how they per­ceive a healthy planet for peo­ple and na­ture. Among them, re­spected Bri­tish nat­u­ral­ist and vet­eran broad­caster David At­ten­bor­ough urged peo­ple to “work with na­ture rather than against it”.</p>
    <p>The time for a pure fo­cus on na­tional in­ter­ests had passed, he wrote. “The wealth­ier na­tions have taken a lot and the time has now come to give,” he added.</p>
