    <p>If the med­i­cal per­son­nel treat­ing US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump are to be be­lieved – and this is a big “if” given the ad­mit­ted ob­fus­ca­tion early on in his Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis – then the Amer­i­can leader is on pace to wrap up his en­tire or­deal with the in­fec­tion in less time than a typ­i­cal vis­i­tor to Sin­ga­pore spends on Stay Home No­tice.</p>
    <p>The 74-year an­nounced that he tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 two Thurs­days ago, was taken to the hos­pi­tal the next day, dis­charged last Mon­day and then cleared to at­tend pub­lic events in per­son as of yes­ter­day. That is 10 days from start to fin­ish.</p>
    <p>Through the course of the episode, events un­folded quickly, with news breaks com­ing by the hour. Peo­ple had to quickly ed­u­cate them­selves about blood oxy­gen lev­els as well as drugs with the names remde­sivir, re­gen­eron and dex­am­etha­sone. Mean­while, the White House clus­ter has grown to in­clude at least 34 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But as things start to set­tle af­ter an ex­traor­di­nar­ily chaotic week in Wash­ing­ton, we can look back on the po­ten­tial im­pact the world’s most high-pro­file Covid-19 case has – not just on the US and its com­ing elec­tions, but also on the tra­jec­tory of the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>1. The lim­its of test­ing</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Trump is ar­guably the sin­gle most pro­tected per­son on the en­tire planet, and yet he got Covid,” Trump cam­paign spokesman Ja­son Miller told NBC news last week­end, cit­ing the fact that Mr Trump was tested reg­u­larly and any­one com­ing into con­tact with the US com­man­der-in-chief was also tested and had their tem­per­a­ture taken.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem, as many med­i­cal ex­perts noted, is that the ad­min­is­tra­tion re­lied too heav­ily on a sin­gle mea­sure, with­out pay­ing at­ten­tion to any of the oth­ers.</p>
    <p>For months, the White House de­pended on a rapid di­ag­nos­tic test for pro­tec­tion while for­go­ing mea­sures like wear­ing masks and safe dis­tanc­ing. Tests vary greatly in their abil­ity to de­tect the virus. Some re­quire only a small amount of virus to re­turn a pos­i­tive re­sult, while oth­ers don’t raise the alarm un­til some­one is closer to the peak of his or her in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The up­shot is that peo­ple can be spread­ing the virus for days be­fore ever ex­pe­ri­enc­ing symp­toms or test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>The most sen­si­tive tests tend to be the PCR ones – the most com­mon type done in Sin­ga­pore – but these also tend to be the slow­est to give re­sults, with swabs need­ing to be pro­cessed in a lab.</p>
    <p>Anti­gen tests, like the ones used by the White House, are much faster but re­quire a much higher vi­ral load be­fore show­ing that a per­son is in­fected.</p>
    <p>White House press sec­re­tary Kayleigh McE­nany’s ex­am­ple il­lus­trates the risk. She, like many other top Trump aides, was tested ev­ery day since the pres­i­dent caught the dis­ease. She tested neg­a­tive for four con­sec­u­tive days from Thurs­day to Sun­day be­fore test­ing pos­i­tive on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>As she did not quar­an­tine dur­ing the four days, de­spite hav­ing come into con­tact with a pa­tient, meant she had four days in which she could have in­fected oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Test­ing is not a pass­port for be­hav­ing reck­lessly and does lit­tle if not paired with other mea­sures.</p>
    <p>2. How Trump’s di­ag­no­sis af­fects global Covid fight</p>
    <p>The im­pact of Mr Trump’s coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion needs to be split into two, based on what he says and what he does (or rather, what is be­ing done to him).</p>
    <p>The two are very dif­fer­ent and how they af­fect any­one’s per­cep­tion of the dis­ease will likely de­pend on which as­pect they pay at­ten­tion to.</p>
    <p>To hear Mr Trump talk about Covid-19, the dis­ease is mi­nor and not worth the un­prece­dented sac­ri­fices put in so far to con­trol it.</p>
    <p>“Don’t be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dom­i­nate your life. We have de­vel­oped, un­der the Trump Ad­min­is­tra­tion, some re­ally great drugs & knowl­edge. I feel bet­ter than I did 20 years ago!” tweeted Mr Trump on the day he was dis­charged from hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage and the sub­se­quent the­atrics around it – Mr Trump re­turned to the White House, walked up a flight of stairs then ripped off his mask for a photo op­por­tu­nity – were all meant to present a tri­umphant im­age.</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ers of the pres­i­dent will see that it is now pos­si­ble, thanks to med­i­cal break­throughs, for a 74-year-old to get in­fected and emerge just days later feel­ing not just back to nor­mal but re­ju­ve­nated.</p>
    <p>From a po­lit­i­cal strat­egy stand­point, it makes sense. If the dis­ease is not as se­ri­ous as it was first made out to be, then the crit­i­cisms of his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s han­dling of it will seem sim­i­larly overblown.</p>
    <p>From a pub­lic health stand­point, there were fears that such a cav­a­lier at­ti­tude to a dis­ease that has al­ready claimed more than one mil­lion lives un­der­mines the al­ready dif­fi­cult task of get­ting the gen­eral pub­lic to stay home, wear masks and so­cially dis­tance.</p>
    <p>That said, I be­lieve the fall­out won’t be very wide­spread. The peo­ple most re­cep­tive to this mes­sage are likely to be po­lit­i­cally aligned with the pres­i­dent and thus al­ready not com­ply­ing with most safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>For the rest, es­pe­cially those out­side the United States and un­moored from the par­ti­san­ship of Amer­i­can pol­i­tics, the cir­cum­stances of such a high-pro­file Covid-19 case could ac­tu­ally re­in­force mes­sages about the threat of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Strip­ping away the bravado of Mr Trump’s words, you see the leader of one of the world’s most pow­er­ful coun­tries, with an un­lim­ited amount of re­sources at his dis­posal, un­able to es­cape the clutches of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>And just a day af­ter an­nounc­ing that he had tested pos­i­tive, Mr Trump seemed to re­quire pow­er­ful med­i­cal in­ter­ven­tion. In the words of one med­i­cal ex­pert, Mr Trump’s med­i­cal team “threw the kitchen sink at him” in terms of Covid-19 med­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Though he is not known to have re­ceived the hy­drox­y­chloro­quine he had ear­lier ad­vo­cated as a Covid-19 panacea, Mr Trump re­ceived al­most ev­ery other promis­ing med­i­ca­tion – even one, re­gen­eron, that has not yet been ap­proved for wide­spread use. That the med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als were will­ing to try ex­per­i­men­tal treat­ments on such an im­por­tant pa­tient sug­gests the pres­i­dent’s symp­toms were not mild.</p>
    <p>So while it is pos­si­ble to see the episode as an in­di­ca­tion that the threat of the coro­n­avirus is ex­ag­ger­ated, it is also en­tirely pos­si­ble to take away the mes­sage that the virus is ex­tremely in­fec­tious and vir­u­lent.</p>
    <p>3. Covid un­likely to swing votes</p>
    <p>By all ac­counts, the 2020 race has been an un­pre­dictable one.</p>
    <p>Al­ready this year, Mr Trump’s Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis aside, there were rev­e­la­tions about him al­legedly pay­ing only US$750 (S$1,000) in tax, the re­lease of record­ings in­di­cat­ing he knew the sever­ity of the virus early but down­played it in pub­lic, na­tion­wide protests sparked by the death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd at the hands of po­lice of­fi­cers and the drama of a planned Supreme Court judge ap­point­ment af­ter the death of Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg.</p>
    <p>Yet, some­one look­ing at the polling would not be able to tell just how volatile the sit­u­a­tion on the ground has been.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the poll tracker from polling analysis web­site FiveThir­tyEight, since Au­gust, when both can­di­dates were of­fi­cially nom­i­nated by their re­spec­tive par­ties, the num­ber of vot­ers say­ing they would vote for Mr Trump has hov­ered in a nar­row range be­tween 42 per cent and 43 per cent for the en­tire pe­riod.</p>
    <p>In the same av­er­age of polls, the num­ber of peo­ple say­ing they would vote for Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den has stayed be­tween 50 per cent and 51 per cent for all ex­cept a few days since then. He ap­peared to get a bump af­ter the first chaotic pres­i­den­tial de­bate but it re­mains to be seen if that boost is per­ma­nent. In re­cent history, such de­bates have not pro­duced last­ing im­pacts.</p>
    <p>That so much can hap­pen with­out any ap­par­ent im­pact on how peo­ple in­tend to vote sug­gests that the news is no longer shap­ing voter pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>Deep par­ti­san­ship and the fact that both can­di­dates are ex­tremely well-known fig­ures have a part to play in the sta­bil­ity of the polls. It is likely that there just aren’t that many un­de­cided vot­ers left.</p>
    <p>If hear­ing Pres­i­dent Trump ad­mit to down­play­ing the dis­ease doesn’t change minds, know­ing he caught it isn’t likely to move the nee­dle.</p>
    <p>This isn’t nec­es­sar­ily to sug­gest that the in­fec­tion has had no im­pact at all.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has trailed Mr Bi­den in the polls for the en­tire elec­tion sea­son and he has been bank­ing on the fi­nal run-up to try and close the gap.</p>
    <p>In the fi­nal month of cam­paign­ing in 2016, Mr Trump kept up a break­neck pace of ral­lies and fund-raisers in swing states which ul­ti­mately pushed him over the line against Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton.</p>
    <p>This elec­tion, per­haps more so than pre­vi­ous ones, is not about try­ing to win over new vot­ers.</p>
    <p>It is about making sure your sup­port­ers are en­er­gised to go out and vote while you try to dis­cour­age your op­po­nent’s vot­ers from tak­ing the trou­ble to turn up at the polling booth.</p>
    <p>Ral­lies are a core part of that strat­egy for Mr Trump and be­ing in quar­an­tine runs the clock down just when he needs it.</p>
    <p>His Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis in ef­fect re­moved one week from the fi­nal month of cam­paign­ing and short­ened the time Mr Trump has to close the gap. It is 10 days talk­ing about his health and not work­ing to en­er­gise his base.</p>
    <p>It is also not yet clear that the book can be closed on Mr Trump’s Covid-19 episode.</p>
    <p>For all the up­beat talk about his health, he has not yet tested neg­a­tive and it re­mains un­clear if the dis­ease has run its course. The risk of in­fec­tion is also ever present for for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Bi­den.</p>
    <p>And if ei­ther man is in­ca­pac­i­tated by the virus, that would be a sur­prise strong enough to change the course of the race.</p>
