    <p>BER­LIN • The po­lit­i­cal tragedy that was un­fold­ing this week in Minsk fol­low­ing an ob­vi­ously rigged elec­tion not only had the brave peo­ple of Be­larus find­ing them­selves on the los­ing end. The Euro­pean Union also painfully had to recog­nise its lim­its.</p>
    <p>Once again, the EU wit­nessed a clear breach of in­ter­na­tional rules and stan­dards hap­pen­ing right on its doorstep – and could do noth­ing but pay lip ser­vice and is­sue rather lame state­ments. It was an­other af­fir­ma­tion that the eco­nom­i­cally pow­er­ful EU is suf­fer­ing from a lack of po­lit­i­cal lever­age.</p>
    <p>Be­larus, a buf­fer state be­tween Rus­sia and the EU, his­tor­i­cally had no real chance to de­velop an iden­tity on its own. Over cen­turies ei­ther be­long­ing to the Pol­ish-Lithua­nian Com­mon­wealth or to the Rus­sian em­pire, it was only in 1991 that the coun­try be­gan to en­joy some sort of in­de­pen­dence. Fac­tu­ally, this in­de­pen­dence lasted only a few years.</p>
    <p>By elect­ing Mr Alexan­der Lukashenko as pres­i­dent in 1994, the peo­ple of Be­larus voted for a strong­man who had no love left for democ­racy. In­stead, Be­laru­sians fell for a man who made peo­ple be­lieve that only an au­to­cratic ruler could safe­guard the coun­try from be­ing swal­lowed up by Moscow. This nar­ra­tive worked for quite some time un­til its im­pli­ca­tions on do­mes­tic free­doms be­came ob­vi­ous.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko, a for­mer direc­tor of a kolkhoz, a col­lec­tive farm un­der com­mu­nism, turned Be­larus into a dic­ta­tor­ship. Free speech was sup­pressed, politi­cians of the op­po­si­tion had to flee the coun­try or mys­te­ri­ously dis­ap­peared, se­cu­rity forces were em­pow­ered and three-quar­ters of the econ­omy were kept in the hands of the state, en­abling a finely wo­ven net of con­trol over its peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Free­dom from Moscow’s po­lit­i­cal con­trol had come with a huge price tag of a loss of do­mes­tic lib­er­ties.</p>
    <p>This all hap­pened while the EU was watch­ing. Al­though sanc­tions were im­posed as a re­sult of the con­tin­ued vi­o­la­tions of hu­man rights, they had lit­tle im­pact in a repub­lic that eco­nom­i­cally is heav­ily in­ter­twined with only one coun­try: Rus­sia. Moscow not only de­liv­ers the much-needed gas, it is also Be­larus’ main trad­ing part­ner. Mr Lukashenko has skil­fully played a game of cat and mouse with Moscow for years.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the EU lifted most of the sanc­tions hop­ing this would lead to a more hu­mane reign of the au­to­crat. Two years ear­lier, Minsk was even made the venue for the so-called Minsk pro­to­col, a group among oth­ers in­clud­ing Rus­sia, France and Ger­many that chose the cap­i­tal of Be­larus for its peace ne­go­ti­a­tions for Ukraine. Thus el­e­vated, Mr Lukashenko en­joyed years of in­ter­na­tional recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>That, how­ever, did not lead to any change in his do­mes­tic pol­i­cy­mak­ing. In the run-up to the elec­tion this month, op­po­si­tion can­di­dates were banned from tak­ing part on spu­ri­ous grounds, ac­cess to state me­dia was al­most zero, and in­de­pen­dent me­dia plat­forms and pub­lic gath­er­ings were ob­structed.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers of the elec­tion watch­dog OSCE, the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Se­cu­rity and Co­op­er­a­tion in Europe, were not in­vited. The of­fi­cial re­sults handed Mr Lukashenko a land­slide re-elec­tion vic­tory, but were dis­puted by the op­po­si­tion and sparked protests by thou­sands that drew a crack­down.</p>
    <p>Be­larus’ ac­tions re­ceived sup­port from Hun­gar­ian Prime Min­is­ter Vik­tor Or­ban, who even urged the EU to drop the few re­main­ing sanc­tions against Be­larus as he trav­elled to Minsk in June for a meet­ing with Mr Lukashenko.</p>
    <p>It is there­fore very likely that Hun­gary will vote against any new puni­tive mea­sures of the EU against Be­larus that are now dis­cussed as a con­se­quence of the bru­tal crack­down of the past days. Since the im­po­si­tion of sanc­tions re­quires a unan­i­mous vote by all mem­bers of the EU, a Hun­gar­ian “nay” can block any such ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>To­gether with Poland, Hun­gary is one of the EU mem­bers that re­peat­edly gets in trou­ble with Brussels be­cause of its own poor record when it comes to the rule of law, in­de­pen­dence of the ju­di­ciary and free­dom of the press.</p>
    <p>It is there­fore an irony of his­tory that Poland this week has called for an ex­tra­or­di­nary EU sum­mit to dis­cuss the sit­u­a­tion in Be­larus. How­ever, the Pol­ish move is driven by fears that Rus­sia, for decades Poland’s arch en­emy, may come closer to its bor­ders in case Be­larus dis­in­te­grates.</p>
    <p>This con­text lays bare one of the key prob­lems of the cur­rent state of the EU. The group­ing car­ries mem­bers such as Poland and Hun­gary that are mas­sively ben­e­fit­ing from EU funds, but de­spise main EU prin­ci­ples which ar­guably leads to an ero­sion of the gen­eral idea of what a united Europe is stand­ing for.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the re­cent sum­mit in Brussels last month, when a huge fi­nan­cial pack­age was adopted to fight the eco­nomic con­se­quences of the Covid-19 pan­demic, mem­bers were hag­gling over money and in­creas­ingly look­ing at the EU only as a gi­ant cash cow to be milked. The EU as a bea­con for po­lit­i­cal free­dom that can reach be­yond its bor­ders did not play any ma­jor role.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia in the mean­time can lean back with­out be­ing afraid that the EU will sig­nif­i­cantly in­flu­ence events in Minsk.</p>
    <p>When Ger­man For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas was talk­ing this week to his Rus­sian coun­ter­part Sergey Lavrov in Moscow, Rus­sia’s top diplo­mat even had the chutz­pah to play down protests in Minsk and com­pare them with ri­ots against the Group of 20 sum­mit in Ham­burg in 2017. Then, hooli­gans from all over Europe in­sti­gated chaos to ham­per the sum­mit, while in Minsk peo­ple le­git­i­mately protested against ob­vi­ous elec­tion fraud.</p>
    <p>All this raises the ques­tion of whether au­to­crats and dic­ta­tors are no longer un­der suf­fi­cient pres­sure from democ­ra­cies.</p>
    <p>Whether it is Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin in Rus­sia, Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan in Turkey, Pres­i­dent Ni­co­las Maduro in Venezuela or Mr Lukashenko in Be­larus, to name only a few: they seem to get away with large-scale op­pres­sion, fraud and false nar­ra­tives.</p>
    <p>The EU, in this process, looks ex­hausted, dis­united and un­able to take se­ri­ous ac­tion. This is the other tragedy of events in Minsk.</p>
