    <p>Some op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men (NS­men) will have to take Covid-19 tests if they can­not avoid be­ing near other peo­ple dur­ing their train­ing, said De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This added mea­sure, which will start this month, is meant to en­hance the de­tec­tion of Covid-19 in­fec­tions and mit­i­gate their spread, given the in­crease in the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces’ (SAF) train­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, he added.</p>
    <p>“For these swab tests, DSO (Na­tional Lab­o­ra­to­ries) is as­sist­ing the SAF to use other meth­ods which are more suited to mass test­ing,” he said. “For ex­am­ple, oropha­ryn­geal mid-turbinate swabs or saliva test­ing.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tial re­sults of tri­als of both these dif­fer­ent ap­pli­ca­tions have been promis­ing with re­gard to the ac­cept­abil­ity and ac­cu­racy of these newer meth­ods.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ng was re­spond­ing to Work­ers’ Party MP Den­nis Tan (Hougang), who asked how the Covid-19 cri­sis has af­fected SAF oper­a­tions and train­ing, and what was be­ing done to en­sure that op­er­a­tional readi­ness and qual­ity of train­ing were not af­fected.</p>
    <p>In his re­sponse, the min­is­ter noted that de­spite Covid-19 be­ing dubbed as the test of this gen­er­a­tion, other se­cu­rity threats are in no way di­min­ished.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, ba­sic mil­i­tary train­ing and largescale overseas ex­er­cises were sus­pended, and in-camp train­ing de­ferred, but other crit­i­cal oper­a­tions have con­tin­ued, he said.</p>
    <p>These in­clude is­land de­fence, pro­tec­tion of key in­stal­la­tions, mar­itime se­cu­rity, air de­fence and counter-ter­ror­ism oper­a­tions. Train­ing schools that are es­sen­tial to sus­tain­ing op­er­a­tional units have also con­tin­ued to run.</p>
    <p>Pre­cau­tions have also been taken for these crit­i­cal units, such as re­duc­ing train­ing group sizes and hav­ing test­ing regimes.</p>
    <p>Some per­son­nel per­form­ing crit­i­cal oper­a­tions have also had to iso­late them­selves in camps and bases for a pe­riod of time be­fore and dur­ing their du­ties.</p>
    <p>The SAF has coped well with the chal­lenges brought on by Covid-19, said Dr Ng, and is pro­gres­sively re­sum­ing more train­ing and ex­er­cises while tak­ing health and safety pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>And while the SAF con­trib­utes to Sin­ga­pore’s fight against Covid-19, it will not be dis­tracted from its core re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, he added.</p>
    <p>“The SAF recog­nises that Sin­ga­pore’s se­cu­rity chal­lenges do not di­min­ish dur­ing this Covid-19 pan­demic – in fact our as­sump­tion is that would-be ag­gres­sors can take advantage of the sit­u­a­tion to do us harm,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The SAF will there­fore con­tinue to be vig­i­lant, and main­tain its level of op­er­a­tional readi­ness through re­al­is­tic train­ing and full man­ning of crit­i­cal units.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan also asked if there were any plans for the SAF to en­hance its train­ing pro­grammes lo­cally or overseas in the com­ing year, if the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion im­proves.</p>
    <p>Dr Ng said Covid-19 can­not be a rea­son not to train. While ad­just­ments have been made to al­low lo­cal train­ing to con­tinue, a lot of army ex­er­cises that have been done overseas is sub­ject to the host coun­tries’ agree­ment.</p>
    <p>“We keep knock­ing on doors to say, ‘We would take mea­sures to pro­tect your pub­lic, and we will make sure that we’re dis­ci­plined, make sure we’re test­ing, but we want to start train­ing’.</p>
    <p>“But we can un­der­stand that that is sub­ject to many fac­tors. Be that as it may, where we can, we will con­tinue and step up lo­cal train­ing.”</p>
    <p>He stressed that mass test­ing is needed for sol­diers to have con­fi­dence to train at the de­sired tempo.</p>
    <p>“If you ask your tank pla­toons to mount up and go into their tanks, they can’t prac­tise safe dis­tanc­ing. And there­fore you have to test all of them. And the way to do that is to have tests which are ac­cept­able, which are ac­cu­rate.”</p>
