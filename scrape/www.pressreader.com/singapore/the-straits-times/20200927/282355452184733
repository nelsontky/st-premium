    <p>I am at the for­mer Gov­ern­ment House, a bun­ga­low atop Fort Can­ning Hill, feel­ing sorry for Sir Stam­ford Raf­fles.</p>
    <p>He who founded Sin­ga­pore in 1819 fea­tures, inevitably, in a new her­itage tour, Foibles In Lead­er­ship: A Hackatour Of The Greats In Sin­ga­pore’s Past.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers, Jour­neys, a com­pany that runs her­itage tours, bills it as an al­ter­na­tive his­tory of Sin­ga­pore dat­ing from the 14th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>It is a bold claim I am not en­tirely con­vinced about. But when it comes to pre­sent­ing a more nu­anced un­der­stand­ing of his­tory, com­pared with pop­u­lar text­book nar­ra­tives, the or­gan­is­ers nail it.</p>
    <p>Raf­fles got some push­back last year un­der the glare of Sin­ga­pore’s bi­cen­ten­nial. Some com­men­ta­tors slammed the colo­nial agent as be­ing more of an op­por­tunis­tic op­pres­sor than a vi­sion­ary leader.</p>
    <p>Re­vi­sion­ist readings of Raf­fles’ role had ex­isted be­fore that, tilt­ing the bal­ance of his­tor­i­cal credit to­wards Sin­ga­pore’s hard­work­ing first Res­i­dent Wil­liam Far­quhar.</p>
    <p>But this painstak­ingly re­searched her­itage walk, which starts at Fort Can­ning Hill and takes in ar­eas near Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore, shows me a dif­fer­ent side of Raf­fles.</p>
    <p>My guide, Jour­neys direc­tor Jeya Ayadu­rai, reads out a let­ter Raf­fles wrote to a friend af­ter mov­ing into the house on top of the hill, which was built in 1822.</p>
    <p>In it, he has been suf­fer­ing from headaches and his doc­tor ad­vises that he might feel bet­ter if he moves to a higher al­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>Even though fun-size Fort Can­ning Hill is hardly the salu­bri­ous Swiss Alps, which was stacked with sana­to­ri­ums in the 19th cen­tury, Raf­fles pro­nounces that he feels “a great dif­fer­ence” just two weeks af­ter tak­ing oc­cu­pancy.</p>
    <p>It may have been a for­lornly valiant at­tempt to keep calm and carry on, but Raf­fles is haunted by death. Four of his five chil­dren died be­fore the age of four in Ben­coolen, where he is Lieu­tenant-Gov­er­nor.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “The tombs of the Malay kings, are, how­ever, close at hand; and I have set­tled that if it is my fate to die here, I shall take my place amongst them.”</p>
    <p>The 14th-cen­tury kings of Sin­ga­pore had a palace on the hill and one of them has a kera­mat, or shrine, named af­ter him. Kera­mat Iskan­dar Shah is still found on Fort Can­ning Hill.</p>
    <p>Raf­fles re­turns to Eng­land, where his wife finds him dead at home the day be­fore his 45th birth­day in 1826. This em­pire builder, who lived fast and died young, suf­fered a haem­or­rhage in his brain.</p>
    <p>As my guide, Mr Ayadu­rai, 59, talks about Raf­fles, I find my­self tuck­ing in my knees and hug­ging them, seated on the steps that lead up to the for­mer Gov­ern­ment House. I feel like a child gath­er­ing with her fel­lows to hear his spell­bind­ing sto­ries.</p>
    <p>Mr Ayadu­rai has another neat trick – he calls at­ten­tion to de­tails that may not loom large in his­tor­i­cal ac­counts, but add greatly to the over­all ex­cite­ment.</p>
    <p>We have walked down the hill near the for­mer City Hall, now the Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore mu­seum, where the of­fi­cial sur­ren­der of the Ja­panese dur­ing World War II was held on Sept 12, 1945.</p>
    <p>The night be­fore, Lord Louis Mount­bat­ten, Supreme Al­lied Com­man­der of South-east Asia, re­ceives word that his Ja­panese coun­ter­part, Hi­saichi Ter­auchi, Supreme Com­man­der of the Im­pe­rial Ja­panese Forces, South­ern Re­gion, has taken ill.</p>
    <p>If I were Lord Mount­bat­ten, I would think Ter­auchi was do­ing the skive of the cen­tury, and swear in Hokkien at the GP who gave him the MC.</p>
    <p>Lord Mount­bat­ten sends his own physi­cian to Ter­auchi, who, in­deed, has been felled by a stroke.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Seishiro Ita­gaki takes his place the next day and the sur­ren­der marks the end of the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion in South-east Asia. As Nazi Ger­many had sur­ren­dered ear­lier in May that year, the war was truly over.</p>
    <p>It is rare to get a sense of his­tory as a sus­pense­ful thriller. Count me in for the next cliffhange­r her­itage ride.</p>
