    <p>I miss trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>I used to travel of­ten, some­times with fam­ily, some­times with friends. From the brain­storm­ing of pos­si­ble des­ti­na­tions to the thrill of tak­ing off, I en­joyed the en­tire process.</p>
    <p>Much like the early stages of ro­man­tic love, the lure of travel ob­scures the pain of visa ap­pli­ca­tions, it­er­a­tive dis­cus­sions about itin­er­ar­ies and end­less scrolling through ho­tel list­ings.</p>
    <p>Given the bit­ter­sweet na­ture of travel, I have no doubt that the com­pul­sion to re­main home­bound is mak­ing me pine for travel more ar­dently this year.</p>
    <p>When I moved to the United States, I found the wide open spa­ces dis­con­cert­ing. In densely pop­u­lated Mumbai, where I grew up, walk­ing down fa­mil­iar streets meant run­ning into at least a hand­ful of peo­ple I knew.</p>
    <p>In Amer­ica, I could walk past carparks filled with cars, but not make eye con­tact with an­other per­son.</p>
    <p>Af­ter hours of driv­ing, I would find a McDon­ald’s out­let that looked ex­actly like the one in my neigh­bour­hood; un­like in In­dia, where di­alects and cuisines changed as our ve­hi­cle passed through dis­tricts and states.</p>
    <p>When we first ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore, my teenage daugh­ter was sur­prised to note that “air­port” in Sin­ga­pore meant only in­ter­na­tional air­port and there was no do­mes­tic air­port.</p>
    <p>Over time, I learnt to use “over­seas” as the catch-all term for travel, since there was no sim­ple “out of town” trip that could be ac­com­plished with­out leav­ing the red dot.</p>
    <p>“It’s the small­est place I have ever lived,” I com­plained to who­ever was will­ing to lis­ten. How could I live on such a small is­land?</p>
    <p>The so­lu­tion turned out to be ex­tremely sim­ple: Sin­ga­pore Air­lines. Through the air­line’s network, I could get to San Francisco and Copen­hagen as eas­ily as I could to Siem Reap and Bali. The ease of nav­i­gat­ing an award-win­ning air­port made de­par­ture a breeze and the easy efficiency upon ar­rival made me feel at home the minute I landed.</p>
    <p>In seven short years, the magic por­tal of Changi Air­port trans­ported me to 17 coun­tries – un­til the pandemic hit. My plans to add three new coun­tries this year to my cur­rent tally of 30 were thwarted.</p>
    <p>As I walked around the green trails in my neigh­bour­hood, hid­ing my dis­ap­point­ment un­der my mask, I looked closely at the pink and pur­ple blos­soms that bright­ened the trail, flow­ers which I had pre­vi­ously no­ticed but al­ways ig­nored.</p>
    <p>Why was I so care­less with the fa­mil­iar and so fas­ci­nated with the for­eign? Was the urge to get away a re­sponse to a push from the dull rou­tine of daily life? Per­haps I could try a stay­ca­tion at a lux­ury ho­tel with an in-house spa.</p>
    <p>Or was it the pull of ex­otic lo­ca­tions in far­away lands? Per­haps a vir­tual Airbnb ex­pe­ri­ence could sat­isfy the crav­ing for a peek into a glam­orous, far-flung lo­cale.</p>
    <p>Or was it a wish for ex­pan­sion that could be ex­pe­ri­enced only by leav­ing the bor­ders of a city-state? Maybe a short “sea­ca­tion” on a cruise ship that floated in in­ter­na­tional wa­ters would help.</p>
    <p>Travel of­fers us an easy es­cape, a change of scene that recharges our senses. We forego the com­forts of home and take off by road and sea. But there is some­thing spe­cial about fly­ing, a feel­ing of flee­ing not just man-made bound­aries on land, but also a pulling away from earth it­self, for how­ever long the air­craft stays air­borne.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore ar­riv­ing in a new coun­try, the flight be­comes a gate­way for new ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, when Qan­tas of­fered a six-hour flight across the vast con­ti­nent of Aus­tralia that promised views of Uluru and the Great Bar­rier Reef, tick­ets sold out in 10 min­utes. Eva Air’s three-hour moon-gaz­ing flight dur­ing the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val was fully booked.</p>
    <p>To me, get­ting on a flight that takes off and lands at the same air­port doesn’t hold much in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>While I fondly re­mem­ber the com­fort of busi­ness-class cab­ins on oth­er­wise bor­ing busi­ness trips, I can’t for­get one in­ter­minable transat­lantic flight in the early days of my trav­el­ling life when I was seated be­tween smok­ing pas­sen­gers in the rear of the air­craft.</p>
    <p>Be­ing veg­e­tar­ian lim­its my food choices on air­planes and I have of­ten been left hun­gry when my re­quest for a spe­cial meal was ig­nored or lost.</p>
    <p>Whether I am fly­ing out or re­turn­ing home, I al­ways choose itin­er­ar­ies with di­rect flights when pos­si­ble or those with the short­est over­all travel time.</p>
    <p>I travel to be awed and in­spired by new places, to be sur­prised and chal­lenged by novel ex­pe­ri­ences that can­not hap­pen when I’m read­ing a book or watch­ing a show on screen.</p>
    <p>In the words of No­bel lau­re­ate Ana­tole France: “What is trav­el­ling? Chang­ing your place? By no means. Trav­el­ling is chang­ing your opin­ions and your prej­u­dices.”</p>
    <p>Whether I soared above the oth­er­worldly fairy chim­neys of Cap­pado­cia in a hot air bal­loon or walked through the labyrinthi­ne me­d­ina of Fez, I en­gaged with my new en­vi­ron­ment with all my senses.</p>
    <p>In Is­tan­bul’s Grand Bazaar, my friends and I grinned in re­sponse to the flam­boy­ant, good-na­tured greet­ings of “welcome, In­dia” from ea­ger sales­men, ir­re­spec­tive of whether we stepped into or moved away from their shop.</p>
    <p>High up in the At­las moun­tains of Morocco, a lit­tle girl pointed to the red bindi on my fore­head and folded her hands in a na­maste ges­ture, fol­lowed by a typ­i­cal Bol­ly­wood dance move that made me laugh, but also con­nected us</p>
    <p>I travel to be awed and in­spired by new places, to be sur­prised and chal­lenged by novel ex­pe­ri­ences that can­not hap­pen when I’m read­ing a book or watch­ing a show on screen.</p>
    <p>with a shared sense of know­ing.</p>
    <p>I was hum­bled by the kind­ness of our tour guide at Jostedal in Nor­way, where our am­bi­tious kayak­ing and glacier-climb­ing ex­pe­di­tion turned into a freez­ing night­mare; and im­pressed by the young hitch­hiker from Bel­gium, whom we picked up on a warm De­cem­ber day in New Zealand’s South Is­land.</p>
    <p>Whether it’s a quick week­end trip to Pe­nang or a two-week driv­ing tour of Europe, hav­ing en­coun­tered a va­ri­ety of peo­ple and ex­pe­ri­enced the va­garies of na­ture, I re­turn home re­freshed, re­newed and will­ing to ob­serve my home turf more closely.</p>
    <p>I agree with novelist Ann Patch­ett, who said: “The best va­ca­tion is the one that re­lieves me of my own life for a while and then makes me long for it again.”</p>
    <p>Given the cur­rent state of the Covid-19 world, with no travel in the fore­see­able fu­ture, this is all I can do: brew some Moroc­can mint tea, fire up the tajine and set up a Zoom call with my travel bud­dies to pore over pho­to­graphs and re­live happy mem­o­ries of time spent ex­plor­ing far­away lands.</p>
