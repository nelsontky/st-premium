    <p>Con­sumers can ex­pect more dig­i­tal wealth man­age­ment ser­vices on UOB’s mo­bile bank­ing app in the next few months.</p>
    <p>Ms Jac­que­lyn Tan, its head of group per­sonal fi­nan­cial ser­vices, said cus­tomers who are more en­gaged tend to trans­act at a higher fre­quency with the bank and spend more with their cards.</p>
    <p>“Pay­ments drive trans­ac­tions, fre­quency and loy­alty, and cre­ate a deeper bank­ing re­la­tion­ship as a whole,” said Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>She noted that 45 per cent of</p>
    <p>UOB’s con­sumer bank­ing cus­tomers make at least one trans­ac­tion a month on its UOB Mighty mo­bile bank­ing app or per­sonal In­ter­net bank­ing plat­form.</p>
    <p>The bank aims to raise this fig­ure to be­tween 45 per cent and 65 per cent by of­fer­ing new ser­vices and im­prov­ing ex­ist­ing ones, added Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>UOB will launch a Sim­ple In­vest tool on UOB Mighty in the first quar­ter of this year, adding on to ex­ist­ing wealth man­age­ment ser­vices in ar­eas such as multi-cur­rency in­vest­ments, gold and sil­ver.</p>
    <p>The tool will be sim­i­lar to its Sim­ple In­sure ser­vice that was launched on the app last month to of­fer cancer in­surance that re­quires just a sim­ple health dec­la­ra­tion. Sim­i­lar in­surance plans will be of­fered in com­ing months.</p>
    <p>The bank is also strength­en­ing its part­ner­ship net­work.</p>
    <p>Last year, it linked up with Visa to al­low cus­tomers to add their cards se­curely into third-party apps via UOB Mighty with­out the need for a phys­i­cal card.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers can al­ready use this new ser­vice to add their Visa card di­rectly to Fit­bit Pay with­out hav­ing to en­ter their de­tails.</p>
    <p>Card hold­ers will also be able to do this on the Fave, Grab and</p>
    <p>Shopee apps with their UOB Visa and Master­card plas­tic later this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said that these ini­tia­tives have “helped us not only with the trans­fer of in­for­ma­tion, but also to build a seam­less cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence and in­crease the rel­e­vance of bank­ing prod­ucts” when peo­ple make pur­chases.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of UOB cus­tomers who used PayNow for the first time rose by more than 50 per cent from Jan­uary to Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, cus­tomers still ap­pre­ci­ate per­sonal in­ter­ac­tion de­spite their greater adop­tion of dig­i­tal tools, and the bank is also re­tain­ing its hu­man touch, said Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>A UOB sur­vey last year found that about 65 per cent of cus­tomers here say they value face-to­face in­ter­ac­tions when it comes to fi­nan­cial plan­ning and ap­ply­ing for loans.</p>
    <p>“It’s not only about in­vest­ing in our dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties, but also in our omni-chan­nel strat­egy to en­gage cus­tomers both on­line and off­line,” said Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>“This makes cus­tomer en­gage­ment even more mean­ing­ful, es­pe­cially for longer-term con­sid­er­a­tions such as wealth plan­ning.”</p>
