    <p>•</p>
    <p>MEL­BOURNE Aus­tralia’s coron­avirus hot spot state of Vic­to­ria yes­ter­day ex­tended a hard lock­down in its cap­i­tal Mel­bourne by two weeks to the end of this month as in­fec­tion rates have de­clined more slowly than hoped.</p>
    <p>State Premier Daniel An­drews ex­tended the hard lock­down, in place since Aug 2, to Sept 28 with a slight re­lax­ation, and mapped out a grad­ual eas­ing of re­stric­tions over the fol­low­ing two months.</p>
    <p>“I know peo­ple are dis­ap­pointed. I’m dis­ap­pointed too that we can­not open up faster. But the key point here is to open and stay open,” Mr An­drews said.</p>
    <p>Start­ing from 11.59pm on Sept 13, some stage four re­stric­tions will be­gin eas­ing in Mel­bourne, with the nightly cur­few start­ing at 9pm in­stead of 8pm. Peo­ple will be al­lowed out­doors for up to two hours in­stead of one, and those liv­ing alone will be al­lowed to have a vis­i­tor. Af­ter Sept 28, if in­fec­tion rates have dropped to be­tween 30 and 50 for 14 days, child­care, con­struc­tion sites, man­u­fac­tur­ing plants and ware­houses will go back to nor­mal. Schools will also par­tially re­open and out­door gath­er­ings of up to five peo­ple would be al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Oct 26, if daily in­fec­tion rates have dropped be­low five over the pre­vi­ous two weeks, cafes and restau­rants could re­open and shops and hair­dressers would do so.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the cur­few would be lifted, there would be no lim­its on leav­ing home, out­door gath­er­ings could in­crease to 10, homes would be able to have five vis­i­tors, and some adult non-con­tact sports could re­sume. Re­gional Vic­to­ria will see a sim­i­lar eas­ing of re­stric­tions to this so-called “stage three” level from Sept 13.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Nov 23, cafes, bars and restau­rants could have more peo­ple in­doors, schools could re­open more fully, mu­se­ums and other en­ter­tain­ment venues could re­open, pub­lic gath­er­ings of up to 50 peo­ple would be al­lowed, and up to 20 vis­i­tors per­mit­ted in homes.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria ac­counts for about 75 per cent of the coun­try’s 26,282 cases and 90 per cent of its 753 deaths. The state yes­ter­day re­ported 63 new in­fec­tions and five deaths.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia will re­ceive the first doses of an As­traZeneca and Ox­ford Univer­sity Covid-19 vac­cine next Jan­uary if tri­als prove suc­cess­ful, af­ter Can­berra agreed on a deal to pur­chase a sec­ond po­ten­tial vac­cine, Prime Min­is­ter Scott Morrison is ex­pected to say to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia said last month that it had signed a pre­lim­i­nary agree­ment with As­traZeneca for enough doses for its pop­u­la­tion that would be man­u­fac­tured by phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany CSL.</p>
    <p>That deal ap­peared i n some doubt when CSL said its pri­or­ity was man­u­fac­tur­ing an al­ter­na­tive po­ten­tial vac­cine de­vel­oped with the Univer­sity of Queens­land (UQ).</p>
    <p>Agree­ing on a deal to over­come the po­ten­tial road­block, Aus­tralia will now also buy 51 mil­lion doses of the UQ vac­cine.</p>
