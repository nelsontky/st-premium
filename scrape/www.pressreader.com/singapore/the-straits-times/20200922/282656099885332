    <p>• Tai­wanese model-ac­tress Chiling Lin has re­port­edly been try­ing to get preg­nant ever since she mar­ried Ja­panese ac­tor Akira, 39, in June last year.</p>
    <p>Lin, 45, was re­cently seen at a hospi­tal in Taipei but the visit was un­for­tu­nately not linked to good news.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s Ap­ple Daily learnt that she went for an op­er­a­tion at the Ear Nose & Throat (ENT) de­part­ment at the hospi­tal last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The news­pa­per sought con­fir­ma­tion from Lin’s man­ager, who said that Lin went for an op­er­a­tion for bronchial prob­lems which had bugged her for five years.</p>
    <p>“Sis­ter Chiling has been suf­fer­ing from al­ler­gic in­flam­ma­tion due to bronchial prob­lems. The doc­tors ad­vised her to do a mi­nor op­er­a­tion at the ENT de­part­ment af­ter ex­am­in­ing her re­s­pi­ra­tory sys­tem,” the man­ager said.</p>
    <p>Lin’s man­ager de­clined to con­firm her ex­act con­di­tion, but said that she has been dis­charged from hospi­tal .</p>
    <p>This is not the first time that Lin has had health is­sues. The Red Cliff (2008, 2009) ac­tress fell from a horse and frac­tured six ribs while film­ing an ad­ver­tise­ment in Dalian, China, in 2005.</p>
    <p>In 2018, she had to take a break from pro­mot­ing the film The Mon­key King 3, which also starred Aaron Kwok and Feng Shaofeng, in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Her man­ager told the me­dia then that doc­tors have ad­vised her to rest and take an­tibi­otics af­ter she was found to have an au­toim­mune dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Last year, Lin had to ab­sent her­self from a char­ity event in Taipei as she had a flu and lost her voice af­ter at­tend­ing an event in Shang­hai.</p>
