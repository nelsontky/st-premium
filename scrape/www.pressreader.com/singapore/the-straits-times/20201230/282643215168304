    <p>The world’s big­gest YouTube star, Felix Kjell­berg, better known as PewDiePie or Pewds, has a new ti­tle – The Most Hand­some Face of 2020.</p>
    <p>In the an­nual list of good-look­ers and head-turn­ers re­leased by TC Can­dler on Mon­day, the 31-yearold Swede took the top spot, beat­ing South Korean band BTS’ Kim Tae-hyung, who goes by the stage name V.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter­sphere ex­ploded as dis­grun­tled BTS fans clashed with the fol­low­ers of PewDiePie, who has 108 mil­lion subscriber­s to his YouTube chan­nel.</p>
    <p>TC Can­dler also re­leased its list of The 100 Most Beau­ti­ful Faces, with 19-year-old Is­raeli model-ac­tress Yael Shel­bia tak­ing the crown and Black­pink’s Lisa in the No. 2 spot.</p>
    <p>Last year, Kjell­berg was in sec­ond place on the highly an­tic­i­pated list of The 100 Most Hand­some Faces, which cre­ates a buzz with its an­nual rank­ing of the top faces across the globe.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter user @sanadesser­t lamented: “Pewdiepie was named the most hand­some man of 2020... I know they ly­ing. How they gonna put him over Tae­hyung. The KIM TAE­HYUNG.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, PewDiePie fans rev­elled in their idol’s as­cent to the top in rank­ing, with one @mel­on­aana tweet­ing: “Here we go again. Some toxic K-pop stans be­rat­ing Pewdiepie be­cause he’s Top 1 in 100 Most Hand­some Faces. Pewds de­serve it.”</p>
    <p>Another Pewds fan, @tim­o­ther­ak­ista, fired a salvo on Twit­ter: “Here comes the armys (sic) and other Kpop fans start­ing a war be­cause some Swedish guy beat their Gods.”</p>
    <p>Even though there were a num­ber of South Korean stars in the top 50, in­clud­ing Jungkook (4th) and Jimin (17th), both from BTS, NCT’s Taey­ong (15th) and As­tro’s Cha Eun-woo (22nd), K-pop fans were up in arms.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter user @iuaeri summed up her dis­may: “PewDiePie won most hand­some face of 2020... man, this re­ally is the worst year for hu­man­ity.”</p>
    <p>Other no­table male stars on this year’s list in­clude Harry Styles, Chris Hemsworth, Shawn Men­des, Henry Cav­ill, Ja­son Mo­moa, Zayn Ma­lik, David Beck­ham and sev­eral more per­son­al­i­ties across var­i­ous pro­fes­sions.</p>
