    <p>About 155,000 HDB house­holds with five or more mem­bers will be re­ceiv­ing dou­ble the usual re­bate on their util­ity bills this month through the goods and ser­vices tax voucher U-Save scheme.</p>
    <p>The value of the larger re­bate for big­ger fam­i­lies is pegged to their type of HDB hous­ing, with those in one- and two-room flats re­ceiv­ing $200 in­stead of the stan­dard $100.</p>
    <p>With the ad­di­tional re­bates, larger fam­i­lies in three- and four­room flats will re­ceive $180 and $160, re­spec­tively this month.</p>
    <p>Those in five-room flats will get $140, while those in ex­ec­u­tive or multi-gen­er­a­tion flats will get $120.</p>
    <p>This is the first of two in­creased re­bates for larger fam­i­lies, with the next round in Jan­uary 2021.</p>
    <p>The U-Save scheme aims to help house­holds with their liv­ing ex­penses, par­tic­u­larly lower- and mid­dle-in­come house­holds, said the Min­istry of Fi­nance yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The re­bate will di­rectly off­set each house­hold’s util­ity bill.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 940,000 HDB house­holds will be re­ceiv­ing their U-Save pay­outs this month.</p>
    <p>Two ear­lier re­bates were paid out in April and July, with ad­di­tional re­bates to those who qual­i­fied for the U-Save Spe­cial Pay­ment.</p>
    <p>This comes as elec­tric­ity bills are set to go up for 53 per cent of house­holds in Sin­ga­pore that are pow­ered by SP Group.</p>
    <p>The en­ergy util­i­ties provider an­nounced last Wed­nes­day that elec­tric­ity tar­iffs will rise by about 9 per cent in the three months of Oc­to­ber to De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The ad­di­tional U-Save re­bates for larger fam­i­lies were an­nounced by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Min­is­ter for Fi­nance Heng Swee Keat in Fe­bru­ary as part of the Covid-19 Care and Sup­port Pack­age.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Mr Heng said: “With greater job un­cer­tainty, house­holds are un­der­stand­ably con­cerned about ex­penses... I hope this ad­di­tional sup­port goes some way in help­ing our house­holds cope in these dif­fi­cult times.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will dis­burse $630 mil­lion through the U-Save scheme this fi­nan­cial year, said the min­istry.</p>
