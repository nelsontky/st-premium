    <p>The vice-pres­i­den­tial de­bate be­tween Repub­li­can Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and Demo­cratic chal­lenger Se­na­tor Ka­mala Har­ris on Wed­nes­day night was rel­a­tively civil, though both speak­ers of­ten evaded the ques­tions di­rected at them.</p>
    <p>That was a wel­come change, an­a­lysts said, from the first pres­i­den­tial de­bate be­tween United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den that turned into a shout­ing match.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence, in par­tic­u­lar, known not only for his re­li­gious con­ser­vatism but also his un­flap­pable com­po­sure, did not lose it. And in many ways, the US got to wit­ness a metaphor­i­cal bridge for the seem­ingly in­sur­mount­able po­lit­i­cal and cul­tural di­vide – a mul­tira­cial pro­gres­sive ver­sus a white con­ser­va­tive.</p>
    <p>“This was a much more sub­stan­tive dis­cus­sion tonight,” said Dr Mitchell McKin­ney, a pro­fes­sor from the Univer­sity of Mis­souri and an ex­pert on cam­paign de­bates.</p>
    <p>“Both of the vice-pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates will come away from this de­bate claim­ing vic­tory, and both avoided any ma­jor gaffes or blun­ders that would do dam­age to their ticket’s chances with vot­ers.”</p>
    <p>Eura­sia Group pres­i­dent Ian Brem­mer wrote on Twit­ter: “Tonight, Bi­den folks thought Har­ris won. Trump folks thought Pence won. That’s a draw.”</p>
    <p>But even though the de­bate was of greater in­ter­est than usual given that both can­di­dates are next in line should some­thing hap­pen to the two old­est pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nees in US his­tory (Mr Trump is 74 and Mr Bi­den is 77), it is un­likely to have moved the nee­dle much in the elec­tion, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>“No one watch­ing this de­bate will vote for pres­i­dent based on their run­ning mates,” said an­a­lyst Tae­gan God­dard, who runs the Po­lit­i­cal Wire news­let­ter.</p>
    <p>“Par­ti­sans are look­ing for the run­ning mate to re­in­force the top of the ticket. If I had to guess, Democrats were prob­a­bly hap­pier about Har­ris than Repub­li­cans were about Pence,” Mr God­dard wrote.</p>
    <p>“But over­all, this de­bate didn’t change much.”</p>
    <p>In the broader con­text of the pres­i­den­tial cam­paign, polls show Mr Bi­den widen­ing his lead over Mr Trump. A New York Times av­er­age of na­tional polls showed Mr Bi­den lead­ing by 9.51 points – more than two points ahead of the av­er­age about a week ago.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rate state polls show that Ohio is a toss-up, with Mr Bi­den lead­ing 45 per cent to Mr Trump’s 44 per cent. In 2016, Mr Trump won Ohio, which has 18 elec­toral votes, by 8 per­cent­age points.</p>
    <p>Quin­nip­iac Univer­sity polls re­leased on Wed­nes­day showed Mr Bi­den lead­ing with 51 per cent to Mr Trump’s 40 per cent in Florida and 54 per cent to 41 per cent in Penn­syl­va­nia – both states that Mr Trump won in 2016.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, early votes have al­ready far out­stripped the 2016 num­bers at the same stage of the race. More than 5.6 mil­lion peo­ple have voted early so far, com­pared with about 75,000 in 2016. Early vot­ing is gen­er­ally seen as favour­ing the Demo­cratic Party.</p>
    <p>Florida has had the great­est num­ber of early vot­ers fol­lowed by Vir­ginia, Michi­gan and Wis­con­sin. South Dakota has seen the great­est in­crease in early vot­ers com­pared with 2016.</p>
    <p>Twenty-three per cent of South Dakota’s 2016 turnout has voted early, fol­lowed by 19 per cent in Wis­con­sin and Vir­ginia, and 15 per cent in Wy­oming.</p>
    <p>“Those are just stag­ger­ing num­bers to see, that this many peo­ple have al­ready voted in these states,” Dr Michael McDon­ald, an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of po­lit­i­cal sci­ence at the Univer­sity of Florida, told USA To­day. He man­ages the United States Elec­tions Project that tracks early vot­ing to­tals.</p>
    <p>At­ten­tion will now turn to the sec­ond pres­i­den­tial de­bate be­tween Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den that is sched­uled for next Thurs­day in Mi­ami. The de­bate was thrown into limbo fol­low­ing the</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent’s Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is back in the White House and is ap­par­ently asymp­to­matic af­ter tak­ing what med­i­cal ex­perts say are ba­si­cally ex­per­i­men­tal drugs.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Com­mis­sion on Pres­i­den­tial De­bates said the de­bate will be vir­tual “to pro­tect the health and safety of all in­volved.” It will take the form of a town meet­ing, with the can­di­dates par­tic­i­pat­ing from sep­a­rate, re­mote lo­ca­tions, the Com­mis­sion said.</p>
    <p>But speak­ing to Fox Business on the phone yes­ter­day, Mr Trump said, “No I’m not go­ing to waste my time on a vir­tual de­bate.”</p>

The de&#xAD;bate was of greater in&#xAD;ter&#xAD;est than usual as both are next in line if some&#xAD;thing should hap&#xAD;pen to the two old&#xAD;est pres&#xAD;i&#xAD;den&#xAD;tial nom&#xAD;i&#xAD;nees in US his&#xAD;tory.</p>
