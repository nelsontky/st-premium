    <p>The fam­ily of a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany ex­ec­u­tive, who died at the age of 44 fol­low­ing a li­po­suc­tion pro­ce­dure in 2013, lost a sub­stan­tial source of fi­nan­cial sup­port as a re­sult of her death, her hus­band has said.</p>
    <p>He made the claim in a med­i­cal neg­li­gence suit in the High Court against the sur­geon who car­ried out the op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Madam Yeong Soek Mun, also known as Mandy, earned about $420,000 a year as head of re­gional mar­ket de­vel­op­ment at Roche Di­ag­nos­tics Asia Pa­cific, the court heard yes­ter­day on the first day of trial.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, re­tired po­lice­man Seto Wei Meng, 55, as the ad­min­is­tra­tor of her es­tate, is su­ing sur­geon Ed­ward Foo Chee Boon for un­spec­i­fied dam­ages, which is to be as­sessed by the court.</p>
    <p>A sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of his claim re­lates to the loss of sup­port and loss of sav­ings or in­her­i­tance claims.</p>
    <p>Mr Seto, rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel Kuah Boon Theng, con­tended that his wife paid for a large por­tion of the fam­ily’s ex­penses, in­clud­ing the ed­u­ca­tional ex­penses of their two sons, who were 13 and 17 when she died. She also sup­ported her par­ents, he said.</p>
    <p>He said Madam Yeong would have ac­cu­mu­lated more wealth had she not died pre­ma­turely.</p>
    <p>On June 28, 2013, Madam Yeong un­der­went a pro­ce­dure at the TCS at Cen­tral Clinic to re­move fat from her ab­dom­i­nal flanks, fol­lowed by a fat trans­fer to smooth the “dents” in her thighs. It was her third li­po­suc­tion pro­ce­dure at the clinic.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a two-hour op­er­a­tion, she de­vel­oped com­pli­ca­tions and was taken to Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SGH), where she died 21/ hours</p>
    <p>2 later.</p>
    <p>In 2014, a coroner’s in­quiry found that she had died from pul­monary fat em­bolism, in which blood flow is blocked by fat par­ti­cles.</p>
    <p>The state coroner ex­pressed con­cerns about how the time of Madam Yeong’s col­lapse was changed sev­eral times in the clinic’s records. He also crit­i­cised the 24-minute de­lay be­fore an am­bu­lance was called.</p>
    <p>In 2016, Mr Seto filed a suit against Dr Foo. He al­leged that Dr Foo did not ob­tain in­formed con­sent from his wife and that the med­i­cal care pro­vided fell be­low the ap­pro­pri­ate stan­dard.</p>
    <p>Dr Foo, rep­re­sented by Se­nior</p>
    <p>Coun­sel N. Sreeni­vasan, con­tended that Madam Yeong had died from an ex­tremely rare com­pli­ca­tion and that he had done all he could to save her life.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the sur­geon pulled SGH into the suit as a third party, claim­ing that it had failed to re­sus­ci­tate Madam Yeong prop­erly.</p>
    <p>SGH, rep­re­sented by Ms Mak Wei Munn, called the ac­tion a be­lated at­tempt to shirk re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
