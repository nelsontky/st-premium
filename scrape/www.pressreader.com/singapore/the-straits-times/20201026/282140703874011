    <p>For­eign work­ers have been in the spot­light since the out­break of Covid-19 in dorms here. But less known is the role some have played in ral­ly­ing their own com­mu­nity, and as part of the larger Sin­ga­pore whole.</p>
    <p>A team of stu­dent re­porters from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity shows the pan­demic from the work­ers’ per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>It is al­most dawn when Bangladesh­i worker Bil­lal Khan, 28, com­pletes his 11-hour night shift on the MRT tracks, in­stalling noise bar­ri­ers along viaducts, and re­turns to his fac­tory-con­verted dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>But his work is not done. At 11am, the se­nior site su­per­vi­sor logs on to the Face­book page he cre­ated – Over­seas For­eign Work­ers in Sin­ga­pore. He then reads the news and looks for ar­ti­cles that have been trans­lated into Ben­gali to de­cide which to share with his more than 5,000 fol­low­ers. Some days, he has to trans­late the news stories him­self.</p>
    <p>The page, cre­ated in April, keeps work­ers up­dated on the Covid-19 pan­demic and ini­tia­tives, such as where they can get free top-up cards.</p>
    <p>Mr Bil­lal also part­ners with non­govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions (NGOs) such as Gey­lang Ad­ven­tures and Mi­grant Mat­ters to de­liver es­sen­tial items, such as toi­letries, to work­ers. He has given out more than 6,000 masks, 3,000 Sing­tel top-up cards, 1,000 bot­tles of soap and sham­poo, and 100 mat­tresses so far.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teer­ing is not new to him. When he was in high school, he founded a char­ity in his home town in Cu­milla, Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>He fa­cil­i­tated a group chat to col­late the needs of lower-in­come fam­i­lies around his neigh­bour­hood. He or­gan­ised do­na­tion drives to raise funds and col­lect items such as rice and veg­eta­bles to dis­trib­ute to the fam­i­lies. The char­ity ran for three years be­fore com­ing to a stop in 2010 when he left for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Like Mr Bil­lal, sev­eral for­eign work­ers have stepped for­ward to take the lead in their com­mu­ni­ties dur­ing the pan­demic. Some coun­selled oth­ers, acted as go-betweens</p>
    <p>with NGOs and even as­sisted dorm staff dur­ing lock­downs.</p>
    <p>BRIDG­ING THE IN­FOR­MA­TION GAP</p>
    <p>An­other Bangladesh­i worker, Mr Zasim, 27, who goes by one name, was ap­pointed an am­bas­sador for the Mi­grant Work­ers’ Cen­tre (MWC), an NGO that caters to the well-be­ing of work­ers.</p>
    <p>From March, the safety su­per­vi­sor an­swered about 30 calls a day from fel­low work­ers wor­ried about how much they would be paid.</p>
    <p>But in May, Mr Zasim was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19. While at Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal from May 5 to 19, he posted videos on his Face­book page doc­u­ment­ing his re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The videos were later used by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) on its Face­book page to show the treat­ment that Mr Zasim re­ceived dur</p>
    <p>ing his hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>He said he wanted to as­sure other work­ers they would be well cared for if they con­tracted the coro­n­avirus. “Ev­ery­one will be­lieve me since I’m the per­son with Covid-19,” said Mr Zasim.</p>
    <p>When he re­cov­ered, he worked with a group started by stu­dents at Tan­glin Trust School, called Mi­grant Sup­port Group, that wanted to col­lect es­sen­tial items for work­ers. Mr Zasim sug­gested pil­lows, de­ter­gent, in­stant noo­dles, cof­fee and ce­real, and the stu­dents ran do­na­tion drives to col­lect them. They man­aged to get enough for 1,000 work­ers and de­liv­ered the care packs to their dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>CAR­ING FOR THOSE AROUND THEM</p>
    <p>When the Westlite Mandai dorm was in lock­down, con­struc­tion</p>
    <p>worker Dhanam Athiban, 28, vol­un­teered to as­sist med­i­cal staff con­duct­ing swab tests.</p>
    <p>He also de­liv­ered meals to work­ers un­able to leave their rooms. He had to un­dergo train­ing by MOM of­fi­cers, par­tic­u­larly on how to wear per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>The Westlite dorm man­agers later paid him $25 a day for his help. The ex­pe­ri­ence was eye-open­ing as he had vol­un­teered in the past to only clean vil­lages near his home town in Ra­manatha­pu­ram, In­dia.</p>
    <p>“There are peo­ple here from dif­fer­ent coun­tries who speak dif­fer­ent lan­guages and eat dif­fer­ent food,” Mr Dhanam said. Some dorm res­i­dents also called on him to help with send­ing money to their fam­i­lies so that they would have cash to pur­chase house­hold ne­ces­si­ties.</p>
    <p>He also be­came the go-to guy for</p>
    <p>many work­ers who opened up and shared their con­cerns about work and their loved ones back home with him. “Around 90 per cent of them have be­come my friends. That is my big­gest hap­pi­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ahmed Amad, 34, was ap­pointed by his em­ployer to over­see 100 work­ers stay­ing at his com­pany’s fac­tory-con­verted dorm.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, since tak­ing charge in March, the Bangladesh­i health and safety su­per­vi­sor worked with NGOs like MWC and Tran­sient Work­ers Count Too to ar­range for masks, fruits and other items to be de­liv­ered to the work­ers.</p>
    <p>His ges­ture touched the hearts of many of his fel­low res­i­dents, in­clud­ing Bangladesh­i san­i­ta­tion plumber Miah Razib, 28, who said: “Ahmed ar­ranged it all on his own. We did not tell him to do it.”</p>
    <p>An­other dorm res­i­dent, In­dian na­tional Ka­jap­a­thy Iyap­pan, 28, said Mr Ahmed treats ev­ery­one as equals. “He does not see In­di­ans or Bangladesh­is dif­fer­ently,” he said.</p>
    <p>He also re­ferred to Mr Ahmed as his “guru” for en­cour­ag­ing him to en­rol in a driv­ing school for a Class 3 li­cence. Af­ter get­ting his li­cence, Mr Iyap­pan was pro­moted to lorry driver and re­ceived a $100 pay rise.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Bil­lal’s suc­cess on Face­book con­tin­ues. Ben­gali me­dia site 24asia.news asked him to man­age its Face­book page, which has more than 100,000 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bil­lal de­clined. He did not want to give up his own page. “I do not need to be fa­mous,” he said. “I’m just do­ing my part for my mi­grant broth­ers.”</p>
