    <p>WHERE 22 Or­ange Grove Road AD­MIS­SION Splash Zone is open to all guests stay­ing at Shangri-La’s ho­tel, ser­viced apart­ments and res­i­dences (cost­ing up­wards of an av­er­age of $270 a night). It is also open to cus­tomers of the ho­tel’s Dine & Splash pack­age, as well as those on its buds mem­ber­ship pro­gramme (from $988 a year for one adult and one child)</p>
    <p>INFO www.shangri-la.com/sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>THE LOW­DOWN</p>
    <p>Shangri-La Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore’s newly opened Splash Zone is touted as the largest out­door wa­ter play­ground and fam­ily pool in a lux­ury ho­tel here. The 1,300 sq ft space con­tains six wa­ter play ar­eas.</p>
    <p>FUN FAC­TOR</p>
    <p>We like that there are dif­fer­ent zones for par­ents and chil­dren of var­i­ous ages.</p>
    <p>My seven-year-old spends so much time on the pi­rate ship with slides and climb­ing fea­tures that she and the staff sta­tioned there are on a first-name ba­sis. My wife and I spend more time with our tod­dler at the wad­ing pools, mini slides, wa­ter wheels, mist sprays and gen­tle wa­ter sprays.</p>
    <p>Care­givers who do not have to look out for their kids con­stantly can lounge on the pool­side decks or do laps at the free-form pool.</p>
    <p>LEARN­ING VALUE</p>
    <p>The area for tod­dlers has fa­cil­i­ties such as wa­ter spouts and lam­i­nar wa­ter flow to en­cour­age sen­sory ex­plo­ration.</p>
    <p>ROOM FOR IM­PROVE­MENT</p>
    <p>Each ses­sion lasts 60 min­utes, which feels a lit­tle short for my wa­ter-lov­ing girls. The du­ra­tion is sub­ject to change, so check with the ho­tel be­fore you go.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery ses­sion is lim­ited to the first 50 peo­ple who regis­ter.</p>
    <p>It is not a place we can rock up to any time we feel like it – we would have to first book a room, get a Dine & Splash pack­age or join its buds mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>INSIDER TIP</p>
    <p>If you are not stay­ing at the ho­tel, you can use the two toi­lets and three out­door show­ers at the Splash Zone.</p>
    <p>Tow­els and floats are pro­vided. Drinks and items such as gog­gles and pool shoes can be bought on­site. There are also lock­ers to stash your be­long­ings.</p>
    <p>WILL WE BE BACK?</p>
    <p>When we are ready to splurge on a one-night stay­ca­tion in a lux­ury ho­tel, this will be it.</p>
