    <p>A man was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to eight months’ jail and two strokes of the cane for mo­lest­ing a friend in her home af­ter a night out.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the 30-yearold Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty in a dis­trict court to one count of mo­lesta­tion.</p>
    <p>Four other sim­i­lar charges were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The of­fender can­not be named be­cause of a gag or­der to pro­tect the vic­tim’s iden­tity.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the two were drink­ing with other friends from about 9pm on Nov 15 last year and left the bar around 1am.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old woman in­vited the man and two other friends to hang out at her home in a Mount Ver­non Road con­do­minium.</p>
    <p>One of the friends left around 3am, while the other fell asleep on a liv­ing room sofa.</p>
    <p>The ac­cused asked the woman if he could stay overnight. They con­tin­ued chat­ting in the liv­ing room when she agreed.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Daniel</p>
    <p>Ling had ear­lier said: “The ac­cused and the vic­tim talked about ‘spoon­ing’, which is a sex­ual topic. Af­ter some time, both the vic­tim and the ac­cused fell asleep on the liv­ing room floor.</p>
    <p>“Some time later, the vic­tim woke up and re­alised that the ac­cused was hug­ging her from be­hind.”</p>
    <p>She left him to use the toi­let and fell asleep in her own bed­room, leav­ing the door to it open.</p>
    <p>The man then crept into her bed. The vic­tim was shocked to find him rest­ing be­side her, the court heard.</p>
    <p>He then slipped his left hand into her top and mo­lested her.</p>
    <p>DPP Ling had told the court: “Scared and fright­ened, the vic­tim took the op­por­tu­nity to roll away from the ac­cused and faced away from him. The vic­tim felt dis­gusted and out­raged.</p>
    <p>“Soon af­ter, the ac­cused’s alarm went off, in­di­cat­ing that it was about 6.30am. The ac­cused got up from the vic­tim’s bed and left the (unit).”</p>
    <p>The woman told her boyfriend, who was then study­ing over­seas, about the in­ci­dent, be­fore alert­ing the po­lice on Nov 21 last year.</p>
    <p>The of­fender is now out on bail of $15,000 and will sur­ren­der him­self on Jan 4 next year to be­gin serv­ing his sen­tence.</p>
    <p>For mo­lesta­tion, he could have been jailed for up to two years, and fined or caned.</p>
