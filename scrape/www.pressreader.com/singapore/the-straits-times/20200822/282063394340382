    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has re­in­forced the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing links among coun­tries and peo­ples, Se­nior Min­is­ter and Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for National Se­cu­rity Teo Chee Hean said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It has shown how such con­nec­tions can­not be taken for granted, he said at the open­ing of an on­line con­fer­ence – China and the</p>
    <p>Mar­itime Silk Road: Ship­wrecks, Ports and Prod­ucts – or­gan­ised by the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum (ACM).</p>
    <p>The three-day event comes ahead of next month’s open­ing of an ex­hi­bi­tion at Shang­hai Mu­seum that will show­case high­lights of the ACM’s Tang Ship­wreck col­lec­tion in China for the first time.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo said the col­lec­tion “gives us a sense of the his­tory of past eras, and al­lows us to bet­ter ap­pre­ci­ate the links that have con­nected civil­i­sa­tions through the ages”.</p>
    <p>“This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant in an in­creas­ingly in­ter­con­nected world which of­fers much prom­ise, but where, un­for­tu­nately, iso­la­tion­ist sen­ti­ments in many coun­tries can also be am­pli­fied,” he said.</p>
    <p>He noted how the dig­i­tal for­mat of the event shows that his­tory is re­plete with ex­am­ples of how peo­ple find ways to con­tinue to in­ter­act in spite of ob­sta­cles and chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“It is when in­ter­ac­tions take place, with open ex­changes of trade, goods, cul­tures, ideas and peo­ple, that hu­man civil­i­sa­tion as a whole ad­vances,” he said.</p>
    <p>The ACM will host the Yon­gle, Wanli – Em­per­ors of the Ming ex­hi­bi­tion in Novem­ber which will fea­ture loans from the Palace Mu­seum in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Both ex­hi­bi­tions com­mem­o­rate the 30th an­niver­sary of diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China this year.</p>
    <p>“They show­case the his­tor­i­cal breadth and depth of our bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship, which con­tin­ues to grow from strength to strength with each gen­er­a­tion,” said Mr Teo.</p>
    <p>He said the Tang Ship­wreck col­lec­tion is a tan­gi­ble demon­stra­tion of the long­stand­ing his­tor­i­cal links be­tween China, South-east Asia and the Mid­dle East that con­tinue to flour­ish to­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo had vis­ited the col­lec­tion at the ACM on Thurs­day with China’s top diplo­mat Yang Jiechi, who was in town on a three-day visit.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tion has some 60,000 ce­ram­ics and lux­u­ri­ous ob­jects of gold and sil­ver that paint a pic­ture of the rich ex­changes since at least the ninth cen­tury along the mar­itime Silk Road.</p>
    <p>The ship­wreck, dis­cov­ered near Beli­tung Is­land off Su­ma­tra in 1998, con­firmed that South-east Asia lay at the heart of this an­cient sea trad­ing net­work.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Teo said the ves­sel it­self demon­strates these in­ter­con­nec­tions – an Arab dhow made of tim­ber sewn to­gether in the style of Per­sian Gulf ships, with wood from Africa and re­paired with ma­te­ri­als na­tive to In­dia and South-east Asia, most likely bound for what would be present-day Iraq and Iran.</p>
    <p>He noted that one of the arte­facts that will be on dis­play in Shang­hai is a blue-and-white dec­o­rated dish – pro­duced in China but dec­o­rated with bril­liant blue cobalt glaze, which was mined in Iran and un­avail­able in China at the time.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo said Sin­ga­pore was a key node along this mar­itime Silk Road, and con­tin­ues to be a hub for trade and the ex­change of ideas.</p>
    <p>He also re­it­er­ated Sin­ga­pore’s sup­port for China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive, which seeks to rekin­dle these Silk Road links – over land and sea.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, he said, “sees the ben­e­fit of en­hanced con­nec­tiv­ity and de­vel­op­ment in the Silk Road spirit of peace and co­op­er­a­tion, open­ness and in­clu­sive­ness, mu­tual learn­ing and mu­tual ben­e­fit”.</p>
    <p>A key part of build­ing mu­tual re­spect and un­der­stand­ing lies in cul­tural and his­tor­i­cal ex­changes, he added.</p>
    <p>“The Tang Ship­wreck col­lec­tion tells the story of how we have all con­nected and worked to­gether over cen­turies to over­come chal­lenges to­gether and achieve shared pros­per­ity and hu­man progress.”</p>
