    <p>If con­firmed by the Se­nate as Trea­sury sec­re­tary, Dr Janet Yellen will be among the most ac­com­plished peo­ple to take over the big of­fice at 1500 Penn­syl­va­nia Av­enue in the 231-year his­tory of the de­part­ment.</p>
    <p>Few peo­ple in any era have served at the high­est lev­els of economic pol­i­cy­mak­ing for as long, and with as much dis­tinc­tion. Among other things, she will be the first per­son to have been the chief White House economist and head of both the Trea­sury and the Fed­eral Re­serve.</p>
    <p>At the Fed, she played a ma­jor role in en­gi­neer­ing the long­est economic ex­pan­sion in Amer­i­can his­tory, cut short only by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans should hope that she has had plenty of rest in the three years since leav­ing govern­ment, be­cause the job she is set to soon oc­cupy may be the hard­est one yet.</p>
    <p>Her big­gest task will be to nav­i­gate the tricky eco­nomics and even trick­ier pol­i­tics of gen­er­at­ing a strong re­cov­ery out of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A stale­mate on Capi­tol Hill over pan­demic re­lief cre­ates the risk that the econ­omy will dip back into re­ces­sion in the months be­fore a coronaviru­s vac­cine is widely avail­able.</p>
    <p>If no deal is reached be­fore Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den is in­au­gu­rated in Jan­uary, Dr Yellen will prob­a­bly play an im­por­tant role in try­ing to push law­mak­ers to agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The Trea­sury sec­re­tary acts as the United States’ chief fi­nan­cial diplo­mat and, in that role, she will face the un­en­vi­able task of try­ing to re­shape a world economic sys­tem that has been dis­rupted by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s trade wars and a bi­par­ti­san rise in dis­trust of China.</p>
    <p>More broadly, the job is more com­plex than sim­ply act­ing as the coun­try’s economist-in-chief. She will be drawn into a wider range of pol­icy ar­eas, and into more in­ten­sive diplo­macy and po­lit­i­cal ma­noeu­vring than she has been to date.</p>
    <p>As im­por­tant and pow­er­ful as the Fed is, in some ways, it can re­sem­ble a univer­sity eco­nomics de­part­ment more than a fast-paced cen­tre of pol­i­cy­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Yellen, like her pre­de­ces­sors, had the ben­e­fit of be­ing able to spend long hours analysing the state of the econ­omy and de­bat­ing the best course of pol­icy, and pre­cisely craft­ing ev­ery word of pub­lic state­ments. Trea­sury sec­re­taries, by con­trast, have their fin­gers in a wide range of do­mes­tic and for­eign poli­cies.</p>
    <p>In re­cent weeks alone, the de­part­ment an­nounced it was im­pos­ing sanc­tions re­lated to North Korea and Iran, in­tro­duc­ing plans for how busi­nesses will be taxed on their pan­demic rescue loans and rul­ing on re­quire­ments for di­vest­ment of the so­cial platform TikTok for na­tional se­cu­rity rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Dr Yellen is no stranger to high-level pol­i­tics and in­ter­na­tional diplo­macy but, if con­firmed, she will be more en­gaged than ever in try­ing to bend both do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional ri­vals to an ad­min­is­tra­tion’s will.</p>
    <p>One par­tic­u­larly in­ter­est­ing area to watch will be the re­la­tion­ship be­tween fis­cal pol­icy – the power to tax and spend, soon to be partly un­der Dr Yellen’s stew­ard­ship – and her for­mer do­main of mon­e­tary pol­icy, the power to ad­just the sup­ply of money.</p>
    <p>Those lines have be­come more blurred this year.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic re­sponse has been or­gan­ised as a joint effort be­tween the Trea­sury, which is putting up bil­lions of dol­lars in cap­i­tal to sup­port debt mar­kets, and the Fed, which ad­min­is­ters the pro­grammes and lends bil­lions more from its own lim­it­less bal­ance sheet to make them more pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>But there have been clear schisms thus far. The Fed has been more in­clined to struc­ture the pro­grammes to help the econ­omy more but with greater risk that the Trea­sury will lose money, while the Trump Trea­sury has been more cau­tious. Mean­while, the Fed is buy­ing vast sums of Trea­sury bonds and keep­ing in­ter­est rates close to zero in­def­i­nitely, seek­ing to stim­u­late the econ­omy – and ef­fec­tively giv­ing the govern­ment carte blanche to spend as nec­es­sary to con­tain the economic fall­out of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It raises knotty ques­tions about just how in­de­pen­dent the cen­tral bank is, and should be, from the rest of the govern­ment at a time of cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Dr Yellen will ap­proach these ques­tions steeped in the in­sti­tu­tional val­ues of the Fed, where she started her ca­reer as a young re­searcher. She has served as pres­i­dent of the San Fran­cisco out­post of the cen­tral bank, as its vice-chair­man, and four years as its leader.</p>
    <p>She and cur­rent Fed chair­man Jerome Pow­ell were col­leagues for many years. She en­trusted him with much of the hard, unglam­orous work of oversee­ing the cen­tral bank’s op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>When she and Mr Pow­ell have the reg­u­lar break­fasts and lunches that are typ­i­cal for the oc­cu­pants of their jobs, there will be an irony that she, as an economist, has a more con­ven­tional re­sume for a Fed chair­man and he, a lawyer and for­mer Wall Street and Trea­sury of­fi­cial, has a job his­tory more typ­i­cal of a Trea­sury sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>Still, ex­pect her to push for more lib­eral use of emer­gency credit fa­cil­i­ties to sup­port the econ­omy, while also main­tain­ing a rel­a­tively tra­di­tional view of the im­por­tance of Fed in­de­pen­dence and its abil­ity to shape mon­e­tary pol­icy with­out be­ing sec­ond-guessed by po­lit­i­cal au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A Trea­sury sec­re­tary with less at­tach­ment to the Fed might take a more flex­i­ble view of the roles of the two or­gan­i­sa­tions. In that sense, the se­lec­tion of Dr Yellen tells us some­thing sig­nif­i­cant about Mr Bi­den’s pri­or­i­ties as he as­sem­bles his team – in par­tic­u­lar, a view that what mat­ters is not flash and daz­zle, but at­tributes like cred­i­bil­ity, se­ri­ous­ness and stature.</p>
    <p>If con­firmed, Dr Yellen will take of­fice amid a mess of an econ­omy, a po­larised po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment and a frayed global economic sys­tem. She will need ev­ery ounce of those qual­i­ties.</p>
