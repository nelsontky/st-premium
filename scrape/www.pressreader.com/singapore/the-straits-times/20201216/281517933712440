    <p>Short-term busi­ness trav­ellers from all coun­tries will be able to stay, work and meet at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties here from mid-Jan­uary, with­out the need for prior quar­an­tine, as ef­forts get un­der way to draw them back to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Those who opt to use the ar­range­ment – likely the first of its kind in the world – will be trans­ported from the air­port to large ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties equipped with self-ser­vice food and bev­er­age op­tions and gym pods.</p>
    <p>There, they can have meet­ings through floor-to-ceil­ing air-tight glass pan­els with lo­cal busi­ness­men and busi­ness­men from other coun­tries, with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>“Global busi­ness travel has been se­verely af­fected by the need for quar­an­tine mea­sures... Dif­fer­ent coun­tries will con­tinue to have dif­fer­ent risk pro­files, and we should not let this hin­der busi­ness meet­ings,” Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said while on a tour of Con­nect@Changi yes­ter­day, one of the fa­cil­i­ties that will be used to house trav­ellers in the seg­re­gated travel lane.</p>
    <p>“Ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties can al­low Sin­ga­pore­ans to meet (busi­ness) trav­ellers from else­where. They can also al­low (busi­ness) trav­ellers from else­where to meet one an­other.”</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar Covid-19 test­ing will be con­ducted through­out the du­ra­tion of their stay – for in­stance, on al­ter­nate days – in ad­di­tion to tests be­fore de­par­ture from their home coun­tries and upon ar­rival here.</p>
    <p>They will also have to move within the fa­cil­ity in their pre­de­clared travel group of up to five peo­ple to re­duce the risk of mass trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The seg­re­gated travel lane is dis­tinct from ex­ist­ing re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ments, which ap­ply only to se­lected coun­tries but al­low those on es­sen­tial busi­ness here to move around Sin­ga­pore more freely.</p>
    <p>The new scheme is ex­pected to in­crease traf­fic at Changi Air­port, where about 15 per cent of trav­ellers pre-Covid-19 en­tered the coun­try for busi­ness-re­lated rea­sons.</p>
    <p>It should also have knock-on ef­fects on the hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor, which could cater food and pro­vide ac­com­mo­da­tion for the trav­ellers once they are given ap­proval, although re­stric­tions in trav­ellers’ move­ments mean the im­pact could be lim­ited.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts, how­ever, said the move has a larger sym­bolic ef­fect and will boost con­fi­dence in Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus as a busi­ness hub, es­pe­cially with the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum set to take place here next year.</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun said: “We have fallen a long way from our peak, so these cal­cu­lated steps to ease re­stric­tions all go to­wards help­ing as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble to claw back some busi­ness. The more we can re­as­sure busi­ness trav­ellers, the bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>Based on pat­terns es­tab­lished last year, roughly nine in 10 of busi­ness trav­ellers to Sin­ga­pore stayed in the coun­try for five days or fewer, hint­ing at the de­mand for such ex­pe­dited, busi­ness-spe­cific travel ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Many of these trav­ellers are cur­rently not cov­ered by re­cip­ro­cal green lane ar­range­ments and have to un­dergo quar­an­tine be­fore they can meet their lo­cal part­ners face to face.</p>
    <p>Con­nect@Changi is a four-star fa­cil­ity cur­rently be­ing built at Sin­ga­pore Expo and Max Atria, about a five-minute drive from Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try will study the de­mand for the seg­re­gated travel lane to assess the num­ber of ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties needed, and could broaden the use of the lane for med­i­cal or fam­ily-vis­it­ing uses.</p>
    <p>For the first time since its launch about 40 years ago, the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum’s (WEF) Global Com­pet­i­tive­ness Re­port has sus­pended its an­nual rank­ing of the com­pet­i­tive­ness of coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Faced with the need for new think­ing on eco­nomic re­cov­ery, as well as miss­ing data from in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, the WEF has in­stead turned its fo­cus to the qual­i­ties that will empower a coun­try for fu­ture eco­nomic trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>It has iden­ti­fied 11 pri­or­ity ar­eas for gov­ern­ments across four key ar­eas: the en­abling en­vi­ron­ment, hu­man cap­i­tal, mar­kets, and the in­no­va­tion ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>These are listed in a spe­cial edi­tion of the WEF an­nual re­port re­leased to­day.</p>
    <p>It also said that coun­tries like Sin­ga­pore, which are dig­i­tally ad­vanced, are well placed to man­age the im­pact of Covid-19 be­cause they have strong so­cial safety nets and ro­bust health­care sys­tems.</p>
    <p>“While the im­me­di­ate pri­or­ity is to re­spond to the health cri­sis... it is also a mo­ment to de­ter­mine how we may shape our eco­nomic sys­tems in the fu­ture so that they are not just pro­duc­tive but also lead to en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity and shared pros­per­ity,” it added.</p>
    <p>Here is how Sin­ga­pore fared in some of the ar­eas:</p>
    <p>1 HU­MAN CAP­I­TAL DE­VEL­OP­MENT</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore tied with Fin­land for hav­ing a ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem that is well placed to meet the needs of em­ploy­ers. It scored 79 out of 100 points, be­hind Switzer­land (82).</p>
    <p>The re­port said global tal­ent short­ages will re­main sig­nif­i­cant un­less coun­tries ramp up reskilling and up­skilling pro­grammes. It cited Sin­ga­pore and France as ex­am­ples of coun­tries which have funded work­ers for ad­di­tional train­ing.</p>
    <p>2 SAFETY NETS AND FI­NAN­CIAL SOUNDNESS</p>
    <p>Economies with strong safety nets – such as Den­mark, Fin­land and Nor­way – are bet­ter able to sal­vage liveli­hoods. The re­port also cited Sin­ga­pore, Tai­wan, Fin­land, the United States and the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE) as economies with strong fi­nan­cial sys­tems.</p>
    <p>This means they can more eas­ily pro­vide credit to small and medium-sized en­ter­prises and keep them afloat, it said.</p>
    <p>3 GOV­ER­NANCE AND PLAN­NING</p>
    <p>Coun­tries that can bet­ter plan and co­or­di­nate health mea­sures with fis­cal and so­cial poli­cies are more suc­cess­ful in tack­ling the cri­sis, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries that have per­formed “rel­a­tively well” in this area in­clude Sin­ga­pore, Switzer­land, Lux­em­bourg, Aus­tria and the UAE.</p>
    <p>4 HEALTH­CARE SYS­TEM AND RE­SEARCH CA­PAC­ITY</p>
    <p>Anec­do­tal ev­i­dence shows economies that ex­pe­ri­enced pre­vi­ous coron­avirus epi­demics like Sars – such as South Korea, Sin­ga­pore and Tai­wan – had bet­ter pro­to­cols and tech­no­log­i­cal sys­tems in place to con­tain the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries with greater biotech­nol­ogy ca­pac­ity and es­tab­lished col­lab­o­ra­tions be­tween uni­ver­si­ties and com­pa­nies – such as Switzer­land, the US and the Nether­lands – are bet­ter able to de­velop so­lu­tions to cope with fu­ture pan­demics, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>5 DIG­I­TAL TRANS­FOR­MA­TION</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is placed third on a top 10 list of economies with a ro­bust dig­i­tal le­gal frame­work. The US is first, fol­lowed by Lux­em­bourg.</p>
    <p>It also fared well in in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy adop­tion (sixth) and dig­i­tal skills (sixth). But it is not among the top 10 for flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments like vir­tual teams and re­mote work­ing.</p>
    <p>6 MOVE­MENT OF PEO­PLE</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is among the 30 economies out of 141 sur­veyed where hir­ing for­eign labour has be­come harder than it was in 2008.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers in­clude Aus­tria, Switzer­land, Den­mark, Italy, Ice­land, the United Kingdom and Swe­den.</p>
    <p>The tight­en­ing of mi­gra­tion poli­cies has lim­ited com­pa­nies’ ac­cess to the in­ter­na­tional pool of tal­ent, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>It also said there is a risk that these pro­tec­tion­ist poli­cies and mind­sets will per­sist.</p>
