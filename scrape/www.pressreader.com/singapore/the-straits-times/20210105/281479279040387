    <p>It has been a hec­tic two years for si­lat ex­po­nent Nu­jaid Hasif Zainal Abidin, who had to jug­gle his aca­demic stud­ies with his ca­reer as a na­tional ath­lete – all this while strug­gling with the curve­ball that Covid-19 threw him last year.</p>
    <p>But Hasif’s ef­forts paid off yes­ter­day when the 20-year-old emerged as the Sin­ga­pore Sports School’s (SSP) top scorer in the In­ter­na­tional Bac­calau­re­ate (IB) di­ploma ex­am­i­na­tions, with a score of 44 out of a max­i­mum 45 points.</p>
    <p>Hasif, who had called time on his ca­reer in June last year, six months af­ter win­ning gold at the 2019 SEA Games, said: “Af­ter re­ceiv­ing my re­sults, I couldn’t process it be­cause ev­ery­thing just hap­pened so fast I can’t re­ally re­mem­ber it. But I thought, ‘I ac­tu­ally did it’.</p>
    <p>“I set this goal (of 44 points) for my­self and at the back of my mind, I thought even if I fall short, at least it’s still quite a good score. I never thought that I would ac­tu­ally reach that goal.”</p>
    <p>He said his flex­i­ble school sched­ule and be­ing part of the ex­tended IB pro­gramme, which saw him com­plete the syl­labus in four years in­stead of the usual two, had helped him achieve his tar­get.</p>
    <p>The Jakarta Asian Games in 2018 proved to be a hec­tic pe­riod as he had to sit for his pre­lim­i­nary ex­ams af­ter the Games with­out any make-up classes.</p>
    <p>Hasif re­counted: “While ev­ery­one was re­cov­er­ing and do­ing re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion af­ter each day, I had to take out my lap­top and fin­ish my es­says. But the peo­ple around me were al­ways un­der­stand­ing of when I needed to fo­cus more on train­ing or school work.” Home-based learn­ing dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod last year also threw up an­other chal­lenge as he found study­ing and learn­ing con­tent harder over Zoom.</p>
    <p>Hasif, who has not de­cided which univer­sity to en­rol in, is now fo­cused on spend­ing time with his fam­ily be­fore en­list­ing for na­tional ser­vice (NS) next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Other SSP stu­dent-ath­letes who re­ceived good news when the re­sults were re­leased yes­ter­day were na­tional squash cham­pion Au Yeong Wai Yhann and shooter Ho Xiu Yi, who scored 43 and 38 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Au Yeong was re­lieved to score 43 af­ter a year of dis­rup­tions owing to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“When you’re go­ing to sit an exam, you feel more as­sured when you have face-to-face con­tact with your teach­ers go­ing through what­ever you’re un­sure of, but we did a lot of Zoom,” said Au Yeong, 21, who plans to study psy­chol­ogy at the Univer­sity of Ed­in­burgh.</p>
    <p>“But it was also a bless­ing in dis­guise be­cause there weren’t many com­pe­ti­tions and with no trav­el­ling at all, I man­aged to put a bit more time into study­ing,” she added.</p>
    <p>Aside from the SSP stu­dent-ath­letes, na­tional swim­mer Jonathan Tan was also cel­e­brat­ing yes­ter­day af­ter the An­glo-Chi­nese School (In­de­pen­dent) stu­dent re­ceived a pleas­ant sur­prise in the form of his 41-point IB score.</p>
    <p>Tan, 18, said: “I told my­self that any­thing above 40 would be good be­cause I was plan­ning to com­plete this year but be­cause of Covid-19, I de­cided to take the exam last year.</p>
    <p>“The tran­si­tion was quite tough be­cause I was away quite a lot in 2019 for train­ing camps and com­pe­ti­tions so I had quite a lot to catch up on and I had to change gear men­tally.”</p>
    <p>The teenager, who is aim­ing to qual­ify for the Tokyo Olympic Games this year, added: “What keeps me go­ing when it’s tough is my pas­sion for swim­ming. I love it and want to do well in it.”</p>
