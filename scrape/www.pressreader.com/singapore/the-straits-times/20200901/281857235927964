    <p>WELLING­TON • Schools and busi­nesses re­opened in Auck­land yes­ter­day af­ter the lift­ing of a lock­down in New Zealand’s largest city to con­tain the resur­gence of the coro­n­avirus, but face masks were made manda­tory on pub­lic trans­port across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The Pa­cific na­tion of five mil­lion peo­ple had ap­peared to have suc­ceeded in halt­ing community trans­mis­sion of Covid-19, but a fresh out­break in Auck­land prompted the govern­ment to place the city back in lock­down last month.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern scaled back the re­stric­tions in Auck­land on Sun­day, but made masks com­pul­sory on pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said yes­ter­day that she was con­fi­dent the new mea­sure would be taken up across New Zealand, adding that “a bit of smil­ing with the eyes be­hind the mask” and kind­ness to Auck­lan­ders, in par­tic­u­lar, would help get the coun­try through the lat­est out­break.</p>
    <p>“We have a plan that we know will work. We just need ev­ery­one’s com­pli­ance and help. If ev­ery­one sticks to those guide­lines and rules, cou­pled to­gether with all the pub­lic health mea­sures that we have, we can make this work,” Ms Ardern, wear­ing a mask her­self, told re­porters in Auck­land.</p>
    <p>Lim­its on pub­lic gath­er­ings in Auck­land re­main and the rest of the coun­try re­mains on alert level 2, which means so­cial dis­tanc­ing norms must be fol­lowed. The govern­ment ex­pects to fur­ther re­view all alert set­tings by Sun­day.</p>
    <p>New Zealand be­came the envy of the world ear­lier this year when it suc­ceeded in elim­i­nat­ing community trans­mis­sion of the coro­n­avirus by im­pos­ing a strict na­tion­wide lock­down.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Ardern said the govern­ment con­tin­ues to pur­sue an elim­i­na­tion strat­egy and is con­fi­dent it can stamp out the out­break in Auck­land.</p>
    <p>The Auck­land clus­ter has grown to 141 cases in to­tal, and the govern­ment ex­pects new in­fec­tions among close con­tacts to con­tinue for some time. The source of the out­break is still be­ing in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>New Zealand an­nounced nine new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, five of which were in the community and were traced to the Auck­land clus­ter.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has recorded 1,387 to­tal con­firmed cases of Covid-19 so far, and 22 deaths.</p>
