    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s plans to in­tro­duce new leg­is­la­tion al­low­ing his gov­ern­ment to ig­nore treaty obli­ga­tions which his coun­try made to the Euro­pean Union have suf­fered a se­ri­ous set­back af­ter Mr Joe Bi­den, the lead­ing Amer­i­can pres­i­den­tial can­di­date, warned that such a move would en­dan­ger Bri­tain’s chances of sign­ing any free trade deal with the US.</p>
    <p>In a tweet re­leased just as top Bri­tish diplo­mats were in Wash­ing­ton seek­ing to re­as­sure US of­fi­cials, Mr Bi­den warned that any trade deal be­tween the United States and Bri­tain “must be con­tin­gent upon re­spect” for in­ter­na­tional treaties, and par­tic­u­larly those be­tween Bri­tain and Ire­land, the only coun­try with which the Bri­tish have a land bor­der.</p>
    <p>For the mo­ment, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment seems un­de­terred; its con­tro­ver­sial plan to give min­is­ters in Lon­don pow­ers to ig­nore obli­ga­tions to the EU is still mak­ing its way through Par­lia­ment in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>But, with stiff op­po­si­tion abroad and the prospects of a re­bel­lion from his own par­lia­men­tary benches, the ex­pec­ta­tion in Lon­don is that the Bri­tish leader is al­ready seek­ing a way out of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain ceased to be a mem­ber of the EU at the end of Jan­uary, based on a treaty which spec­i­fies its fu­ture re­la­tions with the con­ti­nent. One of the key as­pects of that treaty was the ques­tion of North­ern Ire­land, which re­mains part of the UK but shares a bor­der with Ire­land, which re­mains a mem­ber of the EU.</p>
    <p>As part of the 1998 so-called Good Fri­day Agree­ment which ended decades of blood­shed be­tween Catholics and Protes­tants in North­ern Ire­land, Bri­tain and Ire­land vowed to make the bor­der be­tween them ir­rel­e­vant, by hav­ing no checks there.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish promised that, de­spite the fact that they are now out­side the EU, the hard bor­der on the is­land of Ire­land would not re­turn, and the Cus­toms checks which the EU now de­mands from Bri­tain would be done be­tween North­ern Ire­land and the rest of the Bri­tish mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Now, how­ever, the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has in­tro­duced draft leg­is­la­tion which gives its min­is­ters pow­ers to sus­pend these Cus­toms con­trols with North­ern Ire­land, in ef­fect forc­ing Ire­land to im­pose Cus­toms con­trols, as it would be re­quired to do as a re­main­ing EU mem­ber.</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse, min­is­ters in Lon­don are breezily ad­mit­ting that this vi­o­lates in­ter­na­tional treaties to which they are sig­na­to­ries.</p>
    <p>If the Bri­tish leg­is­la­tion goes ahead, the EU is threat­en­ing to sue Bri­tain in the Euro­pean Court of Jus­tice for breach of prom­ises.</p>
    <p>But Amer­i­can politi­cians are fu­ri­ous too.</p>
    <p>Af­ter meet­ing Bri­tish For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab in Wash­ing­ton this week, US House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives Speaker Nancy Pelosi de­clared that “if the UK vi­o­lates its in­ter­na­tional agree­ments” by un­der­min­ing the Good Fri­day ac­cord with Ire­land, “there will be no chance of a US-UK trade agree­ment pass­ing Congress”.</p>
    <p>Mr Raab also re­ceived an open let­ter from other in­flu­en­tial lawmakers in Congress, rais­ing sim­i­lar ob­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>Some of the US out­rage is con­nected to do­mes­tic elec­toral cal­cu­la­tions: it is no­tice­able, for in­stance, that the Con­gress­men mak­ing the most noise on the mat­ter rep­re­sent precincts in the states of New York and Mas­sachusetts, where the eth­nic Ir­ish vote is very in­flu­en­tial.</p>
    <p>But for Amer­i­can politi­cians like Mr Bi­den – him­self of part-Ir­ish de­scent – or for Ms Pelosi, Bri­tain’s de­par­ture from the EU and threat to vi­o­late treaties is seen as syn­ony­mous with Amer­ica’s way­ward be­hav­iour un­der US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump; the fact that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has re­frained from crit­i­cis­ing Bri­tain in pub­lic and that Mr Trump fre­quently ex­presses sup­port for Prime Min­is­ter John­son has only height­ened sus­pi­cions of the Bri­tish politi­cians among their Demo­cratic coun­ter­parts in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son, who spent most of Wed­nes­day an­swer­ing awk­ward par­lia­men­tary ques­tions in Lon­don, ap­pears de­ter­mined to push through his con­tro­ver­sial leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>And, since he en­joys an 80-seat par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity, the Bri­tish Pre­mier can pre­vail, even if some of his back­bench MPs vote against the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr John­son has started claim­ing that he wants to avoid a show­down al­to­gether, by telling MPs that he has “ev­ery hope and ex­pec­ta­tion” that a free trade agree­ment with Eu­rope will be con­cluded, thereby re­mov­ing the need for any bor­der con­trols.</p>
    <p>And, in re­turn, EU of­fi­cials have denied any in­ten­tion of us­ing the thorny North­ern Ire­land ques­tion as a lever to lure the prov­ince away from the rest of the United King­dom, as Bri­tish gov­ern­ment min­is­ters have al­leged.</p>
    <p>Hopes are there­fore ris­ing that this may be suf­fi­cient for the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment to claim vic­tory in this dis­pute and drop threats to ex­ist­ing treaties.</p>
    <p>Still, the rep­u­ta­tional dam­age to the United King­dom is con­sid­er­able.</p>
    <p>“This is a mat­ter of law and trust and good faith,” Dr Ur­sula von der Leyen, pres­i­dent of the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, the EU’s ex­ec­u­tive body, pointed out.</p>
