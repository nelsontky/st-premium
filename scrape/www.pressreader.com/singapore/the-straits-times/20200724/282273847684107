    <p>LONDON • Chi­nese state tele­vi­sion is tak­ing English Premier League foot­ball matches off the air, bring­ing the lu­cra­tive world of pro­fes­sional foot­ball into the in­creas­ingly fraught re­la­tions be­tween Bei­jing and the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>CCTV, which has the rights to broad­cast EPL games in China, will not show the re­main­der of the com­pe­ti­tion, said a per­son fa­mil­iar with the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>The match be­tween Liverpool and Chelsea was not aired as planned on Wed­nes­day, the per­son said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied while dis­cussing in­ter­nal mat­ters.</p>
    <p>There is one fi­nal round of matches re­main­ing this sea­son, slated to be played on Sun­day but CCTV’s sched­ule no l onger in­cludes those games.</p>
    <p>The move comes amid a de­te­ri­o­ra­tion of ties be­tween the two coun­tries in re­cent weeks, with Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s gov­ern­ment ban­ning telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions gi­ant Huawei Tech­nolo­gies and op­pos­ing the new se­cu­rity law im­posed in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain and the United States – which has also been tak­ing a more con­fronta­tional stance with China – have dis­cussed cre­at­ing a coali­tion of coun­tries to counter Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>This would not be the first time com­pet­i­tive sport has been brought into geopol­i­tics. Last year, CCTV dropped cov­er­age of Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) games af­ter Hous­ton Rock­ets gen­eral man­ager Daryl Morey made com­ments sup­port­ing prodemoc­racy pro­test­ers in Hong Kong. CCTV still does not air NBA games in China.</p>
    <p>The move did not ap­pear to ex­tend to stream­ing plat­forms, with the Liverpool-Chelsea match aired on Chi­nese video app PPTV.</p>
    <p>CCTV’s ac­tion “is sym­bolic of what else could come fol­low­ing de­ci­sions around Hong Kong and Huawei”, said Mark Tan­ner, founder of Shanghai-based re­search and mar­ket­ing firm China Skinny.</p>
    <p>And in an in­ten­si­fy­ing of the NBA’s spat with China, the league said it has sev­ered ties with a train­ing cen­tre in the restive western Xin­jiang re­gion.</p>
    <p>In a letter pub­lished on­line by Se­na­tor Mar­sha Black­burn, the NBA also said it had lost “hun­dreds of mil­lions of dol­lars” in rev­enue amid the bit­ter row.</p>
    <p>“The NBA has had no in­volve­ment with the Xin­jiang bas­ket­ball academy for more than a year, and the re­la­tion­ship has been ter­mi­nated,” deputy com­mis­sioner Mark Ta­tum wrote.</p>
    <p>While foot­ball is not as de­vel­oped in China as it is in many Euro­pean or South Amer­i­can na­tions, it is seen as a huge po­ten­tial growth mar­ket, with Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping a no­table fan of the game.</p>
    <p>The move by CCTV, the coun­try’s main state-backed broad­caster, could af­fect a 2015 plan from the leader to trans­form China into a foot­ball su­per­power.</p>
    <p>That pro­posal had prompted com­pa­nies such as Chi­nese en­ter­tain­ment gi­ant Dalian Wanda Group to pour mil­lions of dol­lars into for­eign clubs – a trend that has abated fol­low­ing a crack­down by Bei­jing on cap­i­tal out­flows.</p>
