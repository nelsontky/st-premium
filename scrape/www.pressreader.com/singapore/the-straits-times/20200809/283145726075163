    <p>Grow­ing up, I was lucky enough to catch the Na­tional Day Pa­rade live on more than one oc­ca­sion, while in other years, my friends, the fam­ily and I would crowd around the tele­vi­sion set at home.</p>
    <p>At the stir­ring trum­pet-calls an­nounc­ing the Na­tional An­them, a sense of pride would swell in my chest. Yet, I could not un­der­stand why I had this in­ex­pli­ca­ble love for coun­try. Was it sim­ply an evo­lu­tion­ary need for group be­long­ing?</p>
    <p>When I left Sin­ga­pore for four years of study in Bri­tain at 19, the rea­sons be­came clearer.</p>
    <p>I missed Sin­ga­pore dearly for the sense of se­cu­rity it gave me. In the quiet neigh­bour­hood of Can­ley in the West Mid­lands where I stayed, the street­lights were few and dim. I would of­ten speed-walk home, a hand in my pocket clutch­ing my keys, and never with ear­phones plugged in.</p>
    <p>I missed the ease with which I could get an af­ford­able and warm plate of food, the sheer va­ri­ety of which any hawker cen­tre pro­vides.</p>
    <p>As a for­eign stu­dent on a bud­get, I cooked most of my meals as food was other­wise costly.</p>
    <p>I missed the ef­fi­cient man­ner in which things were done. Open­ing a bank ac­count took weeks.</p>
    <p>While I loved Lon­don for its hus­tle and bus­tle, the cease­less grey of its build­ings every­where paled next to my mem­o­ries of the leafy trees shel­ter­ing the walk from my home in Sin­ga­pore to the near­est – or, for that mat­ter, any – MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>These as­pects of Sin­ga­pore have al­ways been hall­marks of the coun­try, but as we cel­e­brate its</p>
    <p>55th birthday, I hope that we can look into de­vel­op­ing other parts of so­ci­ety that we can be proud of.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing lived through about half of the na­tion’s birthdays – I’m 25 –</p>
    <p>I am proud to see what our lit­tle is­land has be­come. But there is much more I hope it can be, and that I would like to see in the next 55 years.</p>
    <p>Amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, I have read and writ­ten sto­ries of peo­ple who went out of their way to help the vul­ner­a­ble in our so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Some have made spe­cial masks with a trans­par­ent por­tion to help deaf stu­dents who rely on lip read­ing. Two sib­lings, aged 17 and 21, de­cided to take mat­ters into their own hands to set up a men­tor­ship pro­gramme for those out of work, while many oth­ers con­tinue to cook and of­fer free food to those in need.</p>
    <p>At the same time, we wit­nessed Sin­ga­pore­ans hoard­ing food and toi­let pa­per, and strangers be­ing shamed on so­cial me­dia for not wear­ing their masks prop­erly, rather than be­ing told in a way that would en­gen­der pos­i­tive change. There were also com­ments on so­cial me­dia with a twinge of xeno­pho­bia when for­eign-worker dor­mi­to­ries be­gan ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a surge of coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>And while our front-line fight­ers were do­ing their best to tackle the virus, there were in­ci­dents where health­care work­ers who were in uni­form on pub­lic trans­port on their way home were shunned by other com­muters.</p>
    <p>I would, there­fore, like to see Sin­ga­pore be­come a more in­clu­sive and em­pa­thetic so­ci­ety, and for Sin­ga­pore­ans to bet­ter un­der­stand that oth­ers may be go­ing through in­vis­i­ble strug­gles, such as spe­cial needs and dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Re­cent ac­counts give me hope. Last month, my col­league Ting Wei wrote that bus op­er­a­tor Tower Tran­sit hired a wheelchair user as a cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence and in­clu­siv­ity of­fi­cer – the first role of its kind here cre­ated by a pub­lic trans­port op­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>In June, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob called for em­ploy­ment for per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties to be looked at as a na­tional is­sue, rather than for it to be the purview of wel­fare or­gan­i­sa­tions and so­cial ser­vice agen­cies.</p>
    <p>We’ve also seen so­cial me­dia be­ing used for good, such as in May, when a Sin­ga­porean woman di­ag­nosed with Stage 4 breast cancer while in the US was able to re­unite with her fam­ily here, af­ter the pub­lic raised more than $300,000 to fund her trip home.</p>
    <p>Such moves make me hope­ful that out of the eco­nomic dis­lo­ca­tion and un­cer­tainty caused by Covid-19, greater in­clu­siv­ity and more em­pa­thy are also the re­sult.</p>
    <p>I would also like to see us tackle dif­fi­cult top­ics of reli­gion and race with greater sen­si­tiv­ity and ob­jec­tiv­ity, and less di­vi­sive­ness.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve there is room for us as a so­ci­ety to ad­dress these dif­fi­cult is­sues to­gether, rather than by sweep­ing them un­der the mat. The Gov­ern­ment has in­di­cated it wants younger Sin­ga­pore­ans to have more say in how such top­ics are dis­cussed, and the onus is now on my gen­er­a­tion to do so as­sid­u­ously.</p>
    <p>I’ve been hav­ing more con­ver­sa­tions about these top­ics with my friends, and have also come across sev­eral in­sight­ful reads online. If more of us take a step to­wards bet­ter un­der­stand­ing these top­ics, we would have space for more civil and con­struc­tive con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is al­ready known world­wide for its ef­fi­ciency, or­gan­i­sa­tion and se­cu­rity, even though it took be­ing away for me to re­alise this.</p>
    <p>Let us make in­clu­siv­ity, em­pa­thy and un­der­stand­ing our hall­marks, too.</p>
