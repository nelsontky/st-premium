    <p>Around 95,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents have re­ceived fi­nan­cial help through the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant (CSG), in­clud­ing 22,000 peo­ple who suc­cess­fully ap­plied for a sec­ond tranche.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Social and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli pro­vided the up­date in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter did not state the to­tal amount dis­bursed, but it was re­ported in Oc­to­ber that about $148 mil­lion has been dis­trib­uted through the CSG to more than 83,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In his post, Mr Masa­gos said that those who are el­i­gi­ble, and in need of help, can still ap­ply for the CSG till 6pm to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>They can sub­mit their ap­pli­ca­tion via go.gov.sg/CSG with their SingPass and sup­port­ing doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos noted the on­go­ing eco­nomic im­pact of the pan­demic on some Sin­ga­pore­ans as the coun­try en­ters phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>He said the new Covid-19 Re­cov­ery Grant (CRG) will pro­vide some cush­ion from other fi­nan­cial sup­port schemes draw­ing to a close by the end of this year, such as the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Relief Scheme and CSG.</p>
    <p>The CRG sup­ports lower- to mid­dle-in­come Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents who have lost their jobs, have been placed on in­vol­un­tary no-pay leave, or have suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant in­come loss, and have less fi­nan­cial means and fam­ily sup­port.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Masa­gos: “The Covid-19 Sup­port Grant and CRG are part of a suite of gov­ern­ment mea­sures to help Sin­ga­pore­ans sail through this storm, and I am heart­ened that many in­di­vid­u­als, groups and or­gan­i­sa­tions have also stepped up to help their fel­low cit­i­zens through a va­ri­ety of as­sis­tance schemes.</p>
    <p>“Let us all re­main united and help one another as we emerge from this cri­sis to­gether as one na­tion.”</p>
    <p>The CRG pro­vides up to $700 a month for three months.</p>
    <p>It is for peo­ple who are unem­ployed – ei­ther on ac­count of re­trench­ment or be­cause their con­tracts have been ter­mi­nated – or those who have been placed on in­vol­un­tary no-pay leave for at least three con­sec­u­tive months.</p>
    <p>Other groups will get up to $500 a month for three months un­der the same grant.</p>
    <p>These are em­ploy­ees who are fac­ing salary losses of at least 50 per cent on av­er­age for at least three con­sec­u­tive months; and self-em­ployed peo­ple fac­ing an av­er­age loss in net trade in­come (NTI) of at least 50 per cent over a pe­riod of at least three con­sec­u­tive months, com­pared with their av­er­age monthly NTI last year or this year.</p>
    <p>More in­for­ma­tion on el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria and how to ap­ply for the grant are avail­able at go.gov.sg/CRG</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions open on Jan 18.</p>
