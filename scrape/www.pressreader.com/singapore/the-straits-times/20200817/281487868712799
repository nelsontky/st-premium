    <p>Eighty-four-year-old Mr Lui Hock Seng is sel­dom seen without his Nikon cam­era.</p>
    <p>Even when he goes to the hos­pi­tal for med­i­cal ap­point­ments, the cam­era is nes­tled in­side his red back­pack.</p>
    <p>When his son voices his con­cern about Mr Lui lug­ging a heavy bag around to see the doc­tor, he replies: “What if I miss a shot?”</p>
    <p>His ded­i­ca­tion to turn­ing or­di­nary mo­ments into some­thing spe­cial spans decades of pas­sion. A sprightly pace be­lies his age.</p>
    <p>A for­mer me­chanic by pro­fes­sion and a pho­tog­ra­pher by vo­ca­tion, Mr Lui has been unas­sum­ingly doc­u­ment­ing Sin­ga­pore for more than half a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Since 2012, he has been work­ing as a cleaner at Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>The son of a tailor and a house­wife, his in­ter­est in photograph­y started in his youth in the 1950s, when his older brother brought a Ger­man­made Rollei­flex cam­era home.</p>
    <p>Back then, he did not have ac­cess to a dark­room to make prints, so he im­pro­vised by us­ing black cloth to cover the win­dows in the bath­room or kitchen of the zinc-roofed house he shared with his par­ents and five sib­lings.</p>
    <p>He was a mem­ber of the Southeast Asia Pho­to­graphic So­ci­ety for a few years, dur­ing which he honed his photograph­y skills. His sub­jects ranged widely from streetscap­es to por­traits to ar­chi­tec­ture.</p>
    <p>Even an ac­ci­dent at work in his early 40s that re­sulted in par­tial loss of vi­sion did not de­ter him. A metal splin­ter struck his right eye when he was re­pair­ing a car, so he put his left eye to the cam­era in­stead.</p>
    <p>Al­though Mr Lui never pur­sued photograph­y pro­fes­sion­ally, he has picked up awards in sev­eral photo com­pe­ti­tions over the years, and was even ac­cepted as an As­so­ci­ate of The Royal Pho­to­graphic So­ci­ety (ARPS) of Great Bri­tain (1963).</p>
    <p>In 2016, he won third prize in the colour cat­e­gory in the Kam­pong Glam Com­mu­nity Club photograph­y com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>His black-and-white pho­to­graphs of Sin­ga­pore, taken in the 1960s and 1970s, have gained recog­ni­tion in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>In 2018, at the age of 81, the self­taught pho­tog­ra­pher held his first solo ex­hi­bi­tion at Ob­jec­tifs, a cen­tre for photograph­y and film. He also re­leased Pass­ing Time, his first photo book, which cap­tured scenes of Sin­ga­pore from days gone by.</p>
    <p>The same year, he was di­ag­nosed with lym­phoma and un­der­went sev­eral rounds of chemo­ther­apy.</p>
    <p>Shortly after he fin­ished his last round of treat­ment and was dis­charged in March last year, his wife, who had used a wheel­chair and resided in an old folks’ home, died.</p>
    <p>He has three sons and lives in a Hous­ing Board flat in Bis­han with a son in his 50s whose mo­bil­ity is im­paired be­cause of a cy­cling ac­ci­dent. His youngest son, Mr Roger Lui, 46, re­turned to Sin­ga­pore to help care for Mr Lui after work­ing in the oil and gas in­dus­try in Thai­land for about eight years.</p>
    <p>“Fam­ily out­ings in the past oc­ca­sion­ally turned into my fa­ther’s photograph­y ex­cur­sions, much to my mother’s cha­grin,” mused the younger man.</p>
    <p>Touched by Mr Lui’s pas­sion for photograph­y de­spite his med­i­cal con­di­tion, Nikon gave him a Coolpix P1000 last Au­gust.</p>
    <p>An in­tro­vert, he used to spend al­most ev­ery week­end out cap­tur­ing scenes of Sin­ga­pore, but the Covid-19 pan­demic has forced the ac­tive se­nior to pace him­self.</p>
    <p>He now heads out twice a month, mask on and stay­ing away from crowds, while do­ing what he loves.</p>
    <p>“I’m rest­less, so I like to move about. Photograph­y brings me hap­pi­ness,” he says.</p>
    <p>While he laments nos­tal­gi­cally about the places he used to pho­to­graph that no longer ex­ist, he con­tin­ues to cap­ture mem­o­ries of na­ture and peo­ple in colour to­day.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing has damp­ened his pas­sion over the years, not a bad eye, not cancer, not even a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>EV­ERY OP­POR­TU­NITY SEIZED Fam­ily out­ings in the past oc­ca­sion­ally turned into my fa­ther’s photograph­y ex­cur­sions, much to my mother’s cha­grin. ’’ MR ROGER LUI, the youngest son of Mr Lui Hock Seng.</p>
    <p>ON THE GO I’m rest­less, so I like to move about. Photograph­y brings me hap­pi­ness. ’’ MR LUI HOCK SENG, on how he en­joys go­ing out to cap­ture scenes of Sin­ga­pore with his cam­era.</p>
