    <p>Af­ter a long wait, Malaysian ap­pren­tice jockey Cheah Wei Wen will be mak­ing his Kranji de­but to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The Pe­nang-born 19-year-old has been nom­i­nated on Happy Lucky Star in Race 1, Darc Bounty in Race 12 and Billy Bri­tain in Race 14.</p>
    <p>All his rides are trained by his new mas­ter, Stephen Gray.</p>
    <p>For­merly with Kuala Lumpur­based trainer Richard Lines, Cheah headed south to live out his dream of rid­ing in Sin­ga­pore in Fe­bru­ary. But his im­mi­nent bap­tism of fire was doused by the rac­ing sus­pen­sion due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He rode in track­work and tri­als, and was given the green light to ride in races last week. Gray sup­ported his new kid on the block right away with the three rides to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“I’m very happy I will get to ride this Sun­day. It was al­ways my dream to come to Sin­ga­pore and ride one day,” said Cheah, who rode 13 win­ners in 1 1/2 years in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>“My for­mer boss, Mr Richard Lines, is a close friend of Mr Gray. He rang him up last year, and luck­ily, he had no ap­pren­tice jockey at the time – and that’s how I came over here.</p>
    <p>“Malaysia has been good to me, and I re­ally learnt a lot there. But it’s a very good op­por­tu­nity for me to ride in Sin­ga­pore for Mr Gray.</p>
    <p>“Mr Lines also en­cour­aged me, as he be­lieved I would learn more and be­come more in­de­pen­dent if I rode here.”</p>
    <p>Cheah ar­rived in Fe­bru­ary and he thought he would get his Sin­ga­pore li­cence af­ter one or two months. But he was dis­ap­pointed when the virus caused the rac­ing shut­down.</p>
    <p>“I just had to take it. All I could do is keep rid­ing track­work and also on the me­chan­i­cal horse. I jogged every day to keep my weight around 51kg,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t give up. I’m also lucky (three-time Sin­ga­pore cham­pion jockey) Vlad Duric helped out at the sta­bles dur­ing the lock­down. He gave me a lot of ad­vice.”</p>
    <p>Cheah had an early start in horse rac­ing. He sat on his first horse when he was five. His mother was a sec­re­tary to Lines, who was then based at the Batu Gan­tung race­course in Pe­nang.</p>
    <p>“When Mr Lines moved to KL, we joined him there. I was 16, be­came more in­volved in rac­ing, and that’s when I knew I wanted to be­come a jockey,” said Cheah, whose sis­ter is a fly­ing in­struc­tor in Langkawi.</p>
    <p>“My mum didn’t want me to choose that ca­reer, but I told her I didn’t want to study any more. I had made up my mind.”</p>
    <p>He was coached by for­mer Aus­tralian jockey Clau­dio Greco and top Malaysian-based Brazil­ian jockey Jose de Souza.</p>
    <p>He had his first ride on Sept 2, 2018. He fin­ished third on the Lines-trained Perfect Run.</p>
    <p>“I had to wait for my 15th ride to get my first win, and it was on the same horse, Perfect Run (on Nov 10, 2018). I’ll never for­get that day, it meant a lot to me.”</p>
    <p>Cheah is hop­ing he would not have to wait long for his first Kranji suc­cess, since his new mas­ter does not be­lieve in throw­ing his ap­pren­tices with no-hop­ers.</p>
    <p>“As much as pos­si­ble, I try to put my kids on horses who can run a bit. They won’t learn any­thing on slow horses,” said the Kiwi men­tor, who is at his 20th sea­son at Kranji.</p>
