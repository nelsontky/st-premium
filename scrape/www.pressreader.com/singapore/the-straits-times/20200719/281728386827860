    <p>To im­prove its per­for­mance in fu­ture elec­tions, the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) has to do a bet­ter job of ap­peal­ing to young vot­ers, said Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing party also has to ad­dress the “eco­nomic pains” of the mid­dle-aged sand­wiched class to bet­ter the 61.2 per cent vote share it re­ceived at the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who is a mem­ber of the PAP’s top cen­tral ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee, high­lighted these two ar­eas in a speech to party ac­tivists streamed from the PAP’s Be­dok head­quar­ters. He also took ques­tions from re­porters af­ter­wards.</p>
    <p>The PAP has to work hard to un­der­stand and con­nect with young vot­ers, who have dif­fer­ent as­pi­ra­tions, hopes and ex­pec­ta­tions, he said.</p>
    <p>“The is­sues they care about are dif­fer­ent from the older gen­er­a­tion and the older Sin­ga­pore­ans, and they also look at ex­ist­ing is­sues dif­fer­ently,” he said.</p>
    <p>“So we need to build trust and a new so­cial com­pact with younger Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>He also spoke of the need to mo­bilise young peo­ple to help those who need help, not­ing that a few of the PAP’s new MPs are young Sin­ga­pore­ans who “have come up the hard way and feel pas­sion­ately about help­ing oth­ers to suc­ceed”.</p>
    <p>“We will need to get more young peo­ple like them to iden­tify with the PAP as a party that pro­vides hope and a path to the fu­ture, and build our bonds with a new gen­er­a­tion of vot­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the eco­nomic pain of a sub­stan­tial num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans in their 40s and 50s who are look­ing af­ter both elderly par­ents and young chil­dren is equally cru­cial, he added.</p>
    <p>This sand­wiched group has been feel­ing the pinch even be­fore Covid-19 hit, he noted, and is now fac­ing greater chal­lenges as the pan­demic wors­ens, with some hav­ing to take pay cuts or even los­ing their jobs.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the coro­n­avirus, said this is why many of the schemes an­nounced in the four Bud­gets ear­lier this year have been aimed at this group.</p>
    <p>He high­lighted how in the first Bud­get, the Gov­ern­ment in­creased the Skill­sFu­ture Credit top-up for mid-ca­reer work­ers aged 40 to 60 by an ex­tra $500, to help them stay em­ploy­able and move on to new jobs and roles. Some one mil­lion work­ers ben­e­fited from this.</p>
    <p>While there is no way to quickly re­solve the eco­nomic chal­lenges faced by this group of Sin­ga­pore­ans, Mr Wong said that the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to work on com­ing up with ways to help this group ad­dress their dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, no amount of help will be enough in a cri­sis of</p>
    <p>POLI­CIES WILL BE RE­VIEWED, UP­DATED</p>
    <p>No amount of help will be enough in a cri­sis of this mag­ni­tude.</p>
    <p>So, we will con­tinue to re­view and up­date our poli­cies, and we will do what­ever we can to ad­dress their anx­i­eties and pain dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>NA­TIONAL DE­VEL­OP­MENT MIN­IS­TER LAWRENCE WONG, on sup­port for Sin­ga­pore­ans in their 40s and 50s who are feel­ing the pain in the cur­rent cri­sis.</p>
    <p>this mag­ni­tude. So, we will con­tinue to re­view and up­date our poli­cies, and we will do what­ever we can to ad­dress their anx­i­eties and pain dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod,” he said.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter also said that the na­ture of the elec­tion cam­paign­ing, which was mostly done on­line due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions, did not con­nect with some vot­ers.</p>
    <p>“This was a dig­i­tal cam­paign, and we do not do so well in this arena,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Asked if the party’s GE post­mortem had un­cov­ered new rev­e­la­tions that pre­vi­ous re­views did not, Mr Wong said some is­sues – like the need to im­prove on­line cam­paign­ing – have come up af­ter pre­vi­ous elec­tions.</p>
    <p>“We heard this in 2011 as well (about) the need to con­tinue to ap­peal and en­gage younger vot­ers, we are aware. So, in a way, these are a work in progress and we will con­tinue to work harder at it,” he said.</p>
    <p>One spe­cific way would be for the PAP to fo­cus its en­er­gies on mas­ter­ing new dig­i­tal plat­forms that will best con­nect with vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong cited feed­back from a res­i­dent that while the party’s videos on Face­book were good, they were not suited for a plat­form like In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>He added that there might even be new medi­ums, like video-shar­ing plat­form TikTok, which could be­come more rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>“So we will have to ac­cel­er­ate that work to master this new medium, again do­ing more than we have been al­ready but work­ing dou­bly hard at this,” he said.</p>
