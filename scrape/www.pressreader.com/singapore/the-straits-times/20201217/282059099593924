    <p>BW Rhine, a Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered com­mer­cial oil tanker, was at­tacked by an “ex­plo­sives-laden boat”, ac­cord­ing to an of­fi­cial spokesman for Saudi Ara­bia’s Min­istry of En­ergy.</p>
    <p>It is yet un­clear who was be­hind the at­tack and there are no other de­tails about the ex­plo­sive-laden ves­sel at this point.</p>
    <p>BW Rhine was an­chored in Jed­dah, a Saudi port.</p>
    <p>It was re­ported to be dam­aged in the early hours of Mon­day, said Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The tanker suf­fered hull dam­age and there was a small fire, but the 22 crew mem­bers – none of them is Sin­ga­porean – were not in­jured, added MFA.</p>
    <p>The ship is op­er­ated by Haf­nia, a Sin­ga­pore-head­quar­tered tanker firm.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Haf­nia said in a state­ment that the tanker was hit while dis­charg­ing cargo in Jed­dah at about 12.40am lo­cal time that day.</p>
    <p>The crew man­aged to ex­tin­guish the fire with as­sis­tance from the shore-based fire bri­gade and tug boats.</p>
    <p>“It is pos­si­ble that some oil has es­caped from the ves­sel, but this has not been con­firmed and in­stru­men­ta­tion cur­rently in­di­cates that oil lev­els on board are at the same level as be­fore the in­ci­dent,” it added.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent comes less than three weeks af­ter an oil tanker was dam­aged in a pos­si­ble at­tack at the Saudi ter­mi­nal of Shuqaiq, south of Jed­dah, re­ported Bloomberg on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>While it is still un­cer­tain who is to be blamed for the in­ci­dent,</p>
    <p>A close-up of a satel­lite im­age show­ing the BW Rhine tanker in Jed­dah on Tues­day. Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs said the ves­sel suf­fered hull dam­age but the 22 crew mem­bers were not in­jured.</p>
    <p>the Bloomberg re­port men­tioned that Ye­men’s Houthi rebels have pre­vi­ously used sea mines to at­tack ships in Saudi Ara­bian waters.</p>
    <p>The Houthis, who are sup­ported by Iran, have been fight­ing Ye­men’s United Na­tions-backed gov­ern­ment since 2014.</p>
    <p>A Saudi-led coali­tion in­ter­vened a year later on the side of the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore is cur­rently in­ves­ti­gat­ing the in­ci­dent with the rel­e­vant Saudi author­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore con­demns all at­tacks on com­mer­cial ves­sels which pose a se­ri­ous threat to the se­cu­rity and safety of in­ter­na­tional mar­itime nav­i­ga­tion and trade, added MFA.</p>
