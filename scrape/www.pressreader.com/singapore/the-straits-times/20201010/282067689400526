    <p>Sin­ga­pore was ranked 16th out of 30 cities in this year’s global de­men­tia in­no­va­tion readi­ness in­dex, which con­sid­ers how ready cities are in adopt­ing novel ap­proaches to com­bat de­men­tia. We look at the chal­lenges fac­ing Sin­ga­pore as it strives to be­come a more de­men­tia-in­clu­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Not hav­ing a clear idea of how many peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore are liv­ing with de­men­tia and the rel­a­tive in­abil­ity of gen­eral prac­ti­tion­ers to di­ag­nose the con­di­tion are some of the chal­lenges that stand in the way of bet­ter care for suf­fer­ers of the dis­tress­ing con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>These is­sues were raised in a re­cent report that looked at the readi­ness of 30 cities around the world in adopt­ing novel ap­proaches to com­bat de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore was ranked 16th out of 30 cities in the 2020 global de­men­tia in­no­va­tion readi­ness in­dex, which was launched on Thurs­day by the US-based Global Coali­tion on Ag­ing (GCOA), Bri­tain-based Alzheimer’s Dis­ease In­ter­na­tional and Sin­ga­pore’s Lien Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>The top spot in the in­dex went to London, where the lo­cal Alzheimer’s so­ci­ety is lead­ing an ef­fort – sup­ported by the mayor’s of­fice – to be­come a de­men­ti­afriendly city by 2022.</p>
    <p>It is fol­lowed by Glas­gow, Manch­ester, Am­s­ter­dam and Van­cou­ver. Tokyo, the top-per­form­ing Asian city, took sev­enth spot.</p>
    <p>De­men­tia is a global phe­nom­e­non and one that is in­creas­ingly on the radar here as the pop­u­la­tion ages. It de­scribes a set of symp­toms such as mem­ory prob­lems and mood and be­havioural changes that oc­cur when the brain is dam­aged by cer­tain dis­eases, of which Alzheimer’s is the most com­mon.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is mak­ing head­way in im­prov­ing care, with its com­mit­ment to sup­port­ing peo­ple with de­men­tia and the de­vel­op­ment of di­rect com­mu­nity sup­port for them and their care­givers. And aware­ness of the con­di­tion, which has no cure, has grown in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>The report high­lighted some of the ini­tia­tives in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing seem­ingly small ef­forts to up­grade 22 pub­lic hous­ing blocks with clearer sig­nage and vis­ual cues to help peo­ple with de­men­tia nav­i­gate their com­mu­ni­ties, while show­ing that there is am­ple room for im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>GCOA as­so­ciate di­rec­tor Sam Savin told The Straits Times that one of the is­sues here is that there is no pub­licly avail­able de­men­tia plan. Bri­tain, for in­stance, has one.</p>
    <p>“And there’s a gap be­tween the num­ber of peo­ple ex­pected to be liv­ing with de­men­tia and the num­ber of peo­ple with a con­firmed di­ag­no­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Jason Foo, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Alzheimer’s Dis­ease As­so­ci­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore, said a na­tional de­men­tia plan is on its wish list, as it would al­low re­lated min­istries to share data that would en­able so­cial ser­vice agen­cies to for­mu­late ef­fec­tive strate­gies.</p>
    <p>“There is a need for a more col­lab­o­ra­tive ap­proach from the Gov­ern­ment down to the so­cial ser­vice agen­cies to part­ner one an­other to achieve long-term goals to­gether... The Gov­ern­ment and so­cial ser­vice agen­cies should play to their own strengths and com­ple­ment one an­other, not com­pete,” he said.</p>
    <p>The gap that Mr Savin cited is the di­ag­no­sis gap and is ac­tu­ally a world­wide prob­lem, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Philip Yap, a senior con­sul­tant geri­a­tri­cian who leads the mem­ory and de­men­tia care ser­vice at Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal (KTPH).</p>
    <p>To get a solid grasp of the size of the prob­lem here, pub­lic aware­ness needs to go up and peo­ple need to come for­ward, Prof Yap said.</p>
    <p>What is known is that around one in 10 se­niors aged 60 and above here may have de­men­tia. This pool is es­ti­mated at around 86,000 peo­ple and is ex­pected to soar to 130,000 or more by 2030.</p>
    <p>“At the mem­ory clinic, we see more peo­ple with de­men­tia com­ing for­ward, but there are still many who at­tribute it to nor­mal age-re­lated mem­ory loss,” Prof Yap said.</p>
    <p>So this group is not aware of the pro­gres­sive na­ture of de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>“To­day, you’re OK but in one year’s time, you may not be OK and in two years’ time, you may lose your abil­ity to be in­de­pen­dent, you start to get lost,” he said.</p>
    <p>Stigma is an­other is­sue keep­ing peo­ple from get­ting an early di­ag­no­sis. This is es­sen­tially dis­crim­i­na­tion against peo­ple with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo said: “Fam­ily mem­bers may sus­pect de­men­tia, but they may not see the need to get their loved ones di­ag­nosed early be­cause of stigma, or the no­tion that di­ag­no­sis may cause more harm than good.”</p>
    <p>And when peo­ple do seek help, the bot­tle­neck here due to the lack of pri­mary care of­ten gets in the way of early di­ag­no­sis. Re­fer­rals to spe­cial­ists take time. The wait­ing time can be a few months.</p>
    <p>One of the is­sues raised in the report was for gen­eral prac­ti­tion­ers (GPs) to di­ag­nose and treat de­men­tia, as they would be able to help re­duce the bur­den that would oth­er­wise be placed on spe­cial­ists.</p>
    <p>It would be an ideal move, es­pe­cially as peo­ple with de­men­tia tend to be older and thus have other med­i­cal prob­lems like hy­per­ten­sion, or con­di­tions such as con­sti­pa­tion. For ex­am­ple, a pa­tient may not be tak­ing his di­a­betes med­i­ca­tion prop­erly be­cause he has de­men­tia, said Prof Yap.</p>
    <p>Right now, though, GPs here lack the knowl­edge, in­cen­tive and ca­pa­bil­i­ties to di­ag­nose and treat de­men­tia, and would need ac­cess to ser­vices like com­mu­nity-based men­tal health teams and post-di­ag­nos­tic sup­port to do this.</p>
    <p>“We typ­i­cally take about 45 minutes to one hour to as­sess a pa­tient with pos­si­ble de­men­tia. It’s not usu­ally the time that GPs can af­ford,” Prof Yap said.</p>
    <p>In the Car­i­tas net­work, pi­loted by the Agency for In­te­grated Care (AIC) and which KTPH is a part of, Yishun Poly­clinic pa­tients get to con­sult spe­cial­ists like Prof Yap over video­con­fer­ence once a month.</p>
    <p>Get­ting them to go to the hos­pi­tal could mean a wait of a few months, but with such part­ner­ships, the pa­tients can have quicker ac­cess, he said.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, 14 out of 20 poly­clin­ics here of­fer ded­i­cated men­tal health and/or de­men­tia ser­vices, said a spokesman for the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>“Fam­ily physi­cians, nurses, psy­chol­o­gists and med­i­cal so­cial work­ers at the poly­clin­ics are trained and sup­ported by spe­cial­ists from part­ner­ing re­gional hos­pi­tals to care for per­sons with de­men­tia.”</p>
    <p>The spokesman said they will con­tinue to de­velop de­men­tia care ser­vices in the pri­mary care set­ting.</p>
    <p>Mr Savin said the report also noted the lack of qual­ity in-home care as the Gov­ern­ment pri­ori­tises fam­ily as the first line of care.</p>
    <p>“This means peo­ple liv­ing with de­men­tia who might not have enough fam­ily sup­port may have no other op­tion but to be moved to a nurs­ing home (be­cause they can’t get in­home sup­port),” he added.</p>
    <p>There are also very few as­sisted liv­ing fa­cil­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore, though this is one area that will im­prove soon.</p>
    <p>The MOH will be pi­lot­ing new as­sisted liv­ing op­tions to fa­cil­i­tate in­de­pen­dent liv­ing and en­able se­niors to age i n place, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Last year, in a move to widen the de­men­tia care op­tions, Sin­ga­pore launched a ten­der for the first de­men­tia vil­lage oc­cu­py­ing 10 bun­ga­lows in Sem­bawang. The idea was to have a gated com­mu­nity where peo­ple with de­men­tia can live safely.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it re­ceived just one bid, which was re­jected in May be­cause the of­fer price of $15 mil­lion was deemed too low.</p>
    <p>Mr Savin said: “Al­though wait­ing times for nurs­ing homes over­all have fallen na­tion­ally, they are still long for peo­ple liv­ing with de­men­tia. This is as nurs­ing home staff do not nec­es­sar­ily have the skills to care for peo­ple with de­men­tia and may be hes­i­tant to ad­mit them.”</p>
    <p>And the qual­ity of care in nurs­ing homes can be spotty, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Savin said that while per­son­cen­tric care has made in­roads into some of the more pro­gres­sive homes, other care homes are in­sti­tu­tion­alised and peo­ple with de­men­tia may have lit­tle au­ton­omy and be sub­ject to phys­i­cal and chem­i­cal re­straints.</p>
    <p>The topic of re­straint is one that gets Prof Yap fired up.</p>
    <p>In an opinion piece he wrote in 2017, he ques­tioned the value of putting safety (when you re­strain a pa­tient to pre­vent a fall) above the re­spect for the pa­tient’s au­ton­omy and dig­nity.</p>
    <p>“Pro­vid­ing re­straint-free care can go a long way in pre­serv­ing the dig­nity of older per­sons and chang­ing the im­age of el­der­care to one that is more hu­mane and hope­ful,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, au­dits on de­men­tia care qual­ity in hos­pi­tals helped to im­prove hos­pi­tal treat­ment.</p>
    <p>These are not done in Sin­ga­pore, and with­out them there is not a good way to find out if good care is given, Prof Yap said.</p>
    <p>A hos­pi­tal pa­tient who is con­fused and try­ing to get out of bed may be tied down to pre­vent him from fall­ing, but “if you go to the UK, re­straints are not even al­lowed”, he noted.</p>
    <p>KTPH has a re­straint-free ward. The in­dex noted that Sin­ga­pore has es­tab­lished some promis­ing prac­tices, in­clud­ing AIC’s Com­mu­nity Men­tal Health Ecosys­tem and the bundling of for­merly dis­crete de­men­tia care ser­vices into larger neigh­bour­hood net­works.</p>
    <p>Non-profit com­mu­nity care provider Tsao Foun­da­tion leads one such net­work in Wham­poa, while KTPH and AIC to­gether helm an­other in north­ern Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, ac­cess to de­men­tia care can be im­proved.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo said: “There is a broad sys­tem of de­men­tia care in Sin­ga­pore – from helplines and ac­tiv­ity cen­tres to home care and res­i­den­tial fa­cil­i­ties – but it re­mains shal­low.”</p>
    <p>Many of these pro­grammes and ser­vices tend to be generic and clin­i­cal, for ex­am­ple. Fur­ther­more, many cen­tres strug­gle to cope with dif­fi­cult-to-han­dle cases, es­pe­cially those with be­havioural is­sues, he said.</p>
    <p>Many fam­i­lies are “lost” at the point of di­ag­no­sis, or have lim­ited sup­port, and find the sys­tem quite over­whelm­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>There is a need for more in­te­grated ser­vices such as the newly launched Post Di­ag­nos­tic Sup­port to help care­givers, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo also said means test­ing here, which fo­cuses on low-in­come fam­i­lies, can be ex­tended to mid­dle-in­come fam­i­lies as they may need help with the high cost of de­men­tia care.</p>
    <p>The MOH spokesman said they will study the report, which iden­ti­fied ar­eas for im­prove­ment in early de­tec­tion and di­ag­no­sis, as well as ac­cess to care, as they build on the strengths it high­lighted.</p>
    <p>Among many ini­tia­tives, the MOH will con­tinue to ed­u­cate the pub­lic on the im­por­tance of early di­ag­no­sis and the sup­port avail­able.</p>
    <p>“Sup­port­ing per­sons with de­men­tia re­quires a whole-of-so­ci­ety ef­fort and we will con­tinue to work with our part­ners to build a bet­ter sup­port sys­tem for per­sons with de­men­tia and their care­givers,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo con­curred and said that de­vel­op­ing and adopt­ing in­no­va­tions i n de­men­tia care is a marathon, not a sprint.</p>
    <p>“Per­sons liv­ing with de­men­tia are still your neigh­bours, your friends, your con­stituents. Let us sup­port them to live good-qual­ity lives in the neigh­bour­hood, for as long as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>A WHOLE-OF-SO­CI­ETY EF­FORT</p>
    <p>Sup­port­ing per­sons with de­men­tia re­quires a whole-of-so­ci­ety ef­fort and we will con­tinue to work with our part­ners to build a bet­ter sup­port sys­tem for per­sons with de­men­tia and their care­givers. ’’</p>
