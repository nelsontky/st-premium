    <p>An ar­rest war­rant is­sued against a teenager, who was part of an un­law­ful gath­er­ing held de­spite Covid-19 re­stric­tions, was can­celled af­ter she fi­nally turned up at a district court on Tues­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prin­ci­pal District Judge Seah Chi-Ling rep­ri­manded Aqlima Ab­dul Azmi, 19, be­fore sen­tenc­ing her to a fine of $3,000.</p>
    <p>She did not pay the amount and is now serv­ing the de­fault sen­tence of 12 days’ jail.</p>
    <p>Aqlima, who was ab­sent on Tues­day morn­ing when a court of­fi­cer called out her name, had pleaded guilty in Au­gust to an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>She was part of a group of 13 who had gath­ered at a fit­ness cor­ner near Block 42 Beo Cres­cent, off Have­lock Road, on June 27.</p>
    <p>The group in­cluded two mi­nors. They were there at around 9pm that day and all of them, ex­cept for the two mi­nors, con­sumed al­co­hol un­til around 1am, when a res­i­dent from a nearby flat alerted the po­lice.</p>
    <p>All 13 were sub­se­quently hauled up.</p>
    <p>Sai Raghu Vaish­navee Ragu, 19, and Mo­ham­mad Zack Da­nial Ahamad Zaki, 20, pleaded guilty in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Zack was fined $3,000 on Tues­day, while Sai Raghu was sen­tenced to a year’s pro­ba­tion.</p>
    <p>Sai Raghu has to re­main in­doors from 11pm and 6am ev­ery day and per­form 40 hours of com­mu­nity ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Her mother was also bonded for $5,000 to en­sure her good be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Four oth­ers – Nur Sal­iza Mo­hamed Sani, 23; Nu­rul Sheilla Nata­sya Suhaimi, 25; Nu­raznie Ith­nin, 31; and Muham­mad Zaki Jo­hari, 33 – were each fined $4,000.</p>
    <p>The youngest – a 14-year-old boy – was given a 12-month con­di­tional warn­ing.</p>
    <p>Two oth­ers – a 15-year-old youth and a 26-year-old Malaysian man –</p>
    <p>were in­ves­ti­gated for un­re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing three oth­ers are still pend­ing. They are Mo­hamad Iman Ab­dul Rahim, 19; Remy Shah Hail Mee, 20; and Norsyahmi Norhe­sham, 21.</p>
    <p>As part of phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic re­open­ing, which took ef­fect on June 19, each house­hold can re­ceive up to five vis­i­tors a day.</p>
    <p>Groups of up to five peo­ple can also meet out­side homes. They should, how­ever, prac­tise safe dis­tanc­ing and avoid mix­ing be­tween dif­fer­ent groups.</p>
    <p>For each charge un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act, a first-time of­fender can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $10,000.</p>
    <p>A re­peat of­fender can be jailed for up to a year and fined up to $20,000.</p>
