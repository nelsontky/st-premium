    <p>Two arts in­sti­tu­tions in Sin­ga­pore are los­ing their long-time homes, while a third faces the pos­si­bil­ity of los­ing much of its space. This raises im­por­tant ques­tions about struc­tural, fund­ing and pol­icy is­sues in Sin­ga­pore’s arts scene.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­cul­tural Theatre In­sti­tute (ITI), a 20-year-old academy spe­cial­is­ing in train­ing ac­tors in con­tem­po­rary and clas­si­cal Asian theatre tech­niques, will va­cate its 10,000 sq ft venue by the end of the year. Emily Hill, a con­ser­va­tion bun­ga­low owned by the Sin­ga­pore Land Author­ity, has been the school’s home since 2007.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Thirunalan Sasitharan, 62, says: “There’s go­ing to be a hefty in­crease in the rent and we just can’t af­ford it.”</p>
    <p>Vet­eran theatre com­pany The Nec­es­sary Stage (TNS) will have to va­cate the Ma­rine Pa­rade Com­mu­nity Club (MPCC) in Au­gust next year. The com­pany, founded by Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent Alvin Tan, has been based there since 2000.</p>
    <p>TNS has been in a pro­tracted year-long dis­cus­sion with the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion (PA), which owns the com­mu­nity club space, and the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC), which is the in­ter­me­di­ary for arts hous­ing, since the PA an­nounced in a so­cial­me­dia post in July last year that MPCC would be un­der­go­ing ren­o­va­tions.</p>
    <p>TNS gen­eral man­ager Melissa Lim, 43, says the news was a sur­prise as the com­pany had not been in­formed prior to the post. She says: “We have al­ready planned for pro­duc­tions, re­hearsals and work­shops in our space up to 2023, so this will im­pact se­verely on our plans and bud­get­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Substation, a pi­o­neer­ing con­tem­po­rary arts in­sti­tu­tion founded in 1990 by late theatre doyen Kuo Pao Kun, is also wor­ried about pos­si­ble venue loss af­ter the NAC takes back the build­ing for ren­o­va­tions in July next year.</p>
    <p>Raka Maitra, 50, says dis­cus­sions had been on­go­ing about The Substation’s fate long be­fore she and Dr Woon Tien Wei, 45, came on board as co-artis­tic di­rec­tors ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>“The NAC is not telling us that it won’t re­turn the place to us. But it will prob­a­bly be that we won’t come back in full ca­pac­ity,” she adds. She wor­ries that The Substation may face the same fate as Cen­tre 42, a theatre de­vel­op­ment venue in Water­loo Street.</p>
    <p>It was an­nounced in Jan­uary that Cen­tre 42 would be ren­o­vated and an Arts Re­source Hub (an NAC ini­tia­tive to sup­port free­lancers) added, which would also co-run the venue.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment was greeted with dis­may by mem­bers of the arts com­mu­nity, who fret­ted that the change in man­age­ment would af­fect Cen­tre 42’s op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Maitra says: “Just giv­ing The Substation an of­fice is not go­ing to work. How is it go­ing to be an in­cu­ba­tor if it doesn’t have a stu­dio for the artists, if it doesn’t have a theatre to of­fer them?”</p>
    <p>The Substation’s gross floor area of about 1,630 sq m in­cludes a 120 sq m black box, 60 sq m of stu­dio space and a 113 sq m art gallery.</p>
    <p>NAC says it is work­ing with both TNS and ITI on new hous­ing op­tions: “TNS is work­ing with NAC to make book­ings for the Stam­ford Arts Cen­tre Black Box sched­ule, to fa­cil­i­tate its early pro­duc­tion plan­ning. NAC will con­tinue to sup­port ITI in its search for space.”</p>
    <p>As for The Substation, “NAC has of­fered subsidised hous­ing to The Substation at Good­man Arts Cen­tre dur­ing the ren­o­va­tion. There­after, The Substation has been of­fered a re­turn to the ren­o­vated build­ing on the Frame­work for Arts Spa­ces”.</p>
    <p>The frame­work of­fers arts hous­ing un­der four schemes: In­cu­ba­tion, For De­vel­op­ing Artists And Arts Groups, Arts Cen­tres, and Com­mu­ni­ties/Sports Fa­cil­i­ties (CSF).</p>
    <p>The first three schemes of­fer three-year leases, some of which are re­new­able, but capped at a max­i­mum of nine years. The CSF is an Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity (URA) scheme which dic­tates that 60 per cent or more of the to­tal gross floor area must be used for com­mu­nity/pub­lic out­reach.</p>
    <p>Arts spa­ces have grown al­most five times since 1985, when the Art Hous­ing Scheme was in­tro­duced, from less than 10,000 sq m to al­most 50,000 sq m.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the URA, which over­sees the mas­ter plan for land use, says: “To en­sure that the nec­es­sary spa­ces are set aside for the arts com­mu­nity, we work with the NAC, which di­rectly en­gages the arts com­mu­nity, to iden­tify suit­able arts spa­ces that are aligned with the pri­or­i­ties mapped out in its arts mas­ter plan.</p>
    <p>“In gen­eral, the arts com­mu­nity can con­sider land that is zoned for ‘Civic & Com­mu­nity In­sti­tu­tion’ and ‘Res­i­den­tial/In­sti­tu­tion’ un­der URA’s mas­ter plan, as well as com­mer­cial de­vel­op­ments.”</p>
    <p>NAC’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, Mrs Rosa Daniel, 56, ac­knowl­edges that there are legacy is­sues as arts hous­ing pol­icy evolved to keep up with the scene’s de­vel­op­ment. Hence, an ef­fort is on to ra­tio­nalise the schemes.</p>
    <p>But she re­it­er­ates the coun­cil’s com­mit­ment to sup­port­ing arts com­pa­nies with grants and hous­ing sub­si­dies: “NAC aims for a sus­tain­able ap­proach to en­sure the longterm vi­a­bil­ity of our arts groups and artists.”</p>
    <p>There’s go­ing to be a hefty in­crease in the rent and we just can’t af­ford it.</p>
    <p>’’ IN­TER­CUL­TURAL THEATRE IN­STI­TUTE DI­REC­TOR THIRUNALAN SASITHARAN on its space at Emily Hill, a con­ser­va­tion bun­ga­low owned by the Sin­ga­pore Land Author­ity</p>
    <p>The dis­place­ment of long-time arts in­sti­tu­tions brings up is­sues re­lat­ing to struc­ture, fund­ing and pol­icy in the lo­cal arts scene, as well as the shrink­ing space for ex­per­i­men­tal art-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>Maitra says: “Each arts space, our needs are dif­fer­ent. I don’t think NAC re­ally un­der­stands the dif­fer­ence between arts hous­ing and a home for the arts. When it ap­plies this cookie-cut­ter pol­icy to all arts groups, it’s very prob­lem­atic be­cause you can’t have the same rules or strate­gies for all arts groups.”</p>
    <p>The Substation, which pre­dates the for­ma­tion of NAC by a year, is a cul­tural land­mark, says As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Hoe Su Fern, 38, arts and cul­ture man­age­ment pro­gramme co­or­di­na­tor at the School of So­cial Sciences in Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“Many arts and cul­tural spa­ces have dis­ap­peared, from the Fort Can­ning Drama Cen­tre to the Telok Ayer Per­form­ing Arts Cen­tre to the FluxUs Record Store. For The Substation to per­sist and soldier on, it serves as an im­por­tant phys­i­cal marker of our arts and cul­tural mem­ory,” she adds.</p>
    <p>What all three spa­ces have in com­mon is their ded­i­ca­tion to ex­per­i­men­ta­tion and in­cu­ba­tion, which has con­trib­uted to the de­vel­op­ment and mat­u­ra­tion of arts prac­ti­tion­ers. The sta­bil­ity of­fered by a long-term space is crit­i­cal to their artis­tic pur­suits.</p>
    <p>Over the years, TNS’ 716 sq m space, which in­cludes a 142.3 sq m black box, has been in­te­gral to the com­pany’s evo­lu­tion and artis­tic prac­tice.</p>
    <p>Tan, 56, says TNS’ col­lab­o­ra­tive method­ol­ogy evolved be­cause it had a se­cure home base: “Rent-free space is of para­mount im­por­tance for de­vel­op­ing new work be­cause pro­cesses need the lux­ury of space so artist-col­lab­o­ra­tors can give artis­tic at­ten­tive­ness to ex­plo­rations.</p>
    <p>“Most Sin­ga­porean com­pa­nies bleed (grants in our left pocket and out from our right pocket to pay for theatre rental) and go into the red to af­ford theatre-mak­ing in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “Our set was able to be parked in our black box long be­fore open­ing, so our ac­tors were able to ‘live’ in and with them, so their per­for­mance with the set has al­ways been or­ganic, in­creas­ing the qual­ity of our new works.”</p>
    <p>The TNS pantry, where cast and crew gather for con­vivial tea and meal breaks, is famed in the arts com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Play­wright Chong Tze Chien, 45, has “fond mem­o­ries” of the place where he got his theatre start. He joined TNS full time in 1999 and left in 2004.</p>
    <p>Chong says: “Their space at MPCC was my artis­tic play­ground and home. We had more than seven full-time artists at one point, such as my peers Natalie Hennedige and Sean Tobin.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing a black box in that space meant we could de­vote re­sources to artis­tic ex­changes and tal­ent de­vel­op­ment, which left an in­deli­ble im­pres­sion on me as a young prac­ti­tioner and arts ed­u­ca­tor.”</p>
    <p>Hennedige went on to found Cake The­atri­cal Pro­duc­tions and is fes­ti­val di­rec­tor des­ig­nate for the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Fes­ti­val of Arts, while Tobin was head of fac­ulty for theatre at the School of the Arts and has been the artis­tic di­rec­tor of the M1 Fringe Fes­ti­val since 2015.</p>
    <p>Prof Hoe notes that such in­cu­ba­tor spa­ces are “im­por­tant in­for­mal nodes” for the arts scene at large. “They pro­vide a lo­cus for mu­tual sup­port and a sense of fra­ter­nity and sol­i­dar­ity for ev­ery­one who works in, and is in­ter­ested in the arts. They also pro­vide space for artists to come to­gether for mu­tual sup­port and the shar­ing of in­ter­ests.”</p>
    <p>Sasitharan adds: “In­de­pen­dent arts groups are im­por­tant for di­ver­sity. They are ab­so­lutely crit­i­cal in any mul­ti­cul­tural, multi-eth­nic set­ting.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s arts scene has ex­ploded in the past 30 years, thanks in part to the pi­o­neer­ing work of th­ese spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Chong says of TNS: “That space, to me, was a hold­ing place for artists to test their works, de­velop their craft and nur­ture tal­ent with­out judg­ment. It was an in­cu­ba­tion space not just for in-house artists, but also for in­de­pen­dent artists and as­pir­ing prac­ti­tion­ers.</p>
    <p>“With that space, TNS was a pow­er­house de­vel­op­ing works and artists for the fu­ture. Haresh’s plays and TNS’ works grew in so­phis­ti­ca­tion in the lab process.”</p>
    <p>Haresh Sharma has been TNS’ res­i­dent play­wright since 1986 and is also a Cul­tural Medal­lion re­cip­i­ent.</p>
    <p>Chong points out that TNS has cul­ti­vated tal­ent such as ac­tress Siti Khal­i­jah Zainal as well as pi­loted pro­grammes such as Theatre For Se­niors, “the im­pact of which is still be­ing felt to­day”.</p>
    <p>The pre­car­i­ous­ness of small in­sti­tu­tions, no mat­ter how re­spected, points to flaws in the arts ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest is­sues is fund­ing, which is espe­cially crit­i­cal as th­ese groups, by their very na­ture, spe­cialise in the rad­i­cal and ex­per­i­men­tal, which strug­gle to find spon­sor­ship and an au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Prof Hoe points out: “Th­ese fea­tures of The Substation have also pro­duced mon­u­men­tal chal­lenges. For in­stance, The Substation has mostly been on a one-year arts hous­ing lease, un­like other spa­ces that ob­tain a two- to three-year lease. Its pur­suit of the less com­mer­cial and main­stream also means that the pro­grammes are not al­ways fi­nan­cially vi­able.”</p>
    <p>NAC’s Art Hous­ing Scheme sub­sidises rental and its ma­jor com­pany grants of­fer fund­ing of up to 70 per cent of a com­pany’s bud­get.</p>
    <p>But Sasitharan says: “The fund­ing struc­tures do not re­flect the sig­nif­i­cance of th­ese in­de­pen­dent arts or­gan­i­sa­tions. In­vari­ably, work done by in­de­pen­dent arts or­gan­i­sa­tions tend to be un­der­funded or may re­ceive only sub­sis­tence fund­ing. If there is a slight change to any­thing, for in­stance, if rent goes up, or, worse, some­thing like Covid-19 hap­pens, in­come streams are af­fected straight away.</p>
    <p>“All of the money we raise goes to op­er­a­tional needs. Once cash flow is af­fected, bam, it be­comes an ex­is­ten­tial cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>Even though ITI is a ma­jor grant re­cip­i­ent, he adds: “Most com­pa­nies, even in the best-case sce­nario, get 50 per cent if they’re lucky... So, even by its own stan­dards, NAC is un­der-fund­ing com­pa­nies that it deems are ma­jor play­ers in the arts ecol­ogy.”</p>
    <p>He also points out: “There is a com­pletely dis­pro­por­tion­ate man­ner in which fund­ing is given to in­fra­struc­ture projects, to cap­i­tal projects in the arts. So the build­ing of the­atres, the build­ing of mu­se­ums, the large na­tional projects, suck up mas­sive fund­ing. This is the ed­i­fice com­plex.”</p>
    <p>There has been a ten­dency over the past decade to cen­tralise arts fund­ing and in­sti­tu­tions, arts vet­er­ans note. Prof Hoe says: “A thriv­ing arts ecosys­tem should be de­cen­tralised and di­verse.</p>
    <p>“For­mal in­sti­tu­tions, such as state-ini­ti­ated and state-man­aged spa­ces, tend to op­er­ate by play­ing within OB (out of bounds) mark­ers and the con­di­tions of the state. While for­mal in­sti­tu­tions like the Es­planade may of­fer im­por­tant re­sources, in­creas­ingly, they are also cre­at­ing and pro­duc­ing their own pro­grammes. All th­ese mean that th­ese spa­ces and in­sti­tu­tions tend to gate-keep, rather than en­able the bet­ter­ing of lo­cal con­di­tions for artis­tic and cul­tural pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>“We need spa­ces that cham­pion the voice and ex­pres­sion of the artist, rather than those of the state.”</p>
