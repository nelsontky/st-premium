    <p>KIEV An air­line has banned a Turk­ish woman from fu­ture flights af­ter she opened a plane’s emer­gency exit door and climbed onto its wing on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The woman stepped onto the wing when the air­craft landed in Kiev, Ukraine, com­plain­ing that she was feel­ing “too hot”.</p>
    <p>The woman had flown from An­talya, Turkey, with her hus­band and two chil­dren, Bri­tish pa­per The Sun re­ported on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>An In­sta­gram page ded­i­cated to the Ukrainian city Bo­ryspil later posted a video of the woman on the wing.</p>
    <p>The video showed her re-en­ter­ing the plane through the emer­gency exit while the air­port staff ap­peared to talk to her from the ground.</p>
    <p>A fel­low pas­sen­ger said that al­most ev­ery­one had dis­em­barked from the air­craft when the woman stepped onto the wing, the Evening Stan­dard re­ported.</p>
    <p>“She walked al­most all the way from the tail to the emer­gency exit row, opened the door and went out,” the pas­sen­ger said. Her two chil­dren had al­ready de­planed as well when they saw her on the wing.</p>
    <p>Upon see­ing the woman, the pi­lot called for an am­bu­lance, po­lice and bor­der guards.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the re­port, the woman had al­ready made her way back inside the plane when they ar­rived.</p>
    <p>The author­i­ties later con­firmed that she was not un­der the in­flu­ence of al­co­hol or drugs af­ter run­ning a test on her.</p>
    <p>Ukraine In­ter­na­tional Air­lines has since banned her from fu­ture flights with it. It said in a state­ment that she had “il­le­gally opened the emer­gency exit” of the air­craft.</p>
    <p>“The pas­sen­ger was black­listed for gross vi­o­la­tion of avi­a­tion safety rules and be­hav­iour on board,” it added.</p>
