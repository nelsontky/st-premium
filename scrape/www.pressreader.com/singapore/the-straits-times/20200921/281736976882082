    <p>SEOUL • South Korea yes­ter­day ex­tended Level 2 so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures for a week un­til Sun­day, which lim­its in­door gath­er­ings to be­low 50 and out­door meet­ings to fewer than 100, and could tighten lim­its for the Chuseok hol­i­day, when peo­ple tra­di­tion­ally re­unite with their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun said the Level 2 re­stric­tions need to be kept ahead of Chuseok as “cases with un­trace­able ori­gins are steadily in­creas­ing and fewer tests be­ing car­ried out on week­ends means we should be on high alert”.</p>
    <p>So­cial dis­tanc­ing poli­cies for the hol­i­day, from Sept 30 to Oct 2, will be an­nounced in the com­ing days.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 82 new coro­n­avirus cases as at mid­night last Satur­day, the low­est daily in­fec­tions since the mid­dle of last month, ac­cord­ing to the Korea Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>Of the to­tal, 72 were lo­cally trans­mit­ted. The coun­try’s to­tal tally is 22,975, with 383 deaths.</p>
    <p>Clus­ters of in­fec­tions from a church and a po­lit­i­cal rally sparked a sec­ond wave of out­breaks last month, driv­ing the daily tally to more than 400, be­fore the num­bers be­gan drop­ping to the low 100s early this month.</p>
    <p>Some events have still gone ahead – with a twist: On an open field in Seoul at the week­end, the au­di­ence watched from the safety of their cars as a clown jug­gled and ac­ro­bats launched them­selves through the air above a stage.</p>
    <p>The an­nual cir­cus – usu­ally held in May – was pushed back twice this year be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The per­form­ing arts are very im­por­tant, even dur­ing a pan­demic,” said Seoul Street Art Cre­ation Cen­tre man­ager Cho Beong-hee. “So we came up with dif­fer­ent ideas in try­ing to make this event hap­pen and the drive-in op­tion was cho­sen as it was deemed the safest idea.”</p>
    <p>Each event al­lows 30 cars to park in front of the stage. The event is streamed on­line for free.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the lack of in­ter­ac­tion with the au­di­ence posed new chal­lenges for the per­form­ers. “I had to reimag­ine and re­think new ways to go about my per­for­mance,” said per­former Lee Sung-hyung.</p>
    <p>The crowd clapped and honked car horns as ac­ro­bats swung above the gi­ant stage, hoisted by a crane.</p>
    <p>In the au­di­ence, Ms Yu Hye-jin said she was sat­is­fied with her seat. “I think watch­ing per­for­mances in cars is great,” she added. “I think it can be done in the fu­ture, with other per­for­mances like mu­si­cals.”</p>
