    <p>TOKYO/SEOUL/BEI­JING Some Asian coun­tries are rolling out early and more ag­gres­sive in­fluenza vac­ci­na­tion pro­grammes this year, seek­ing to re­duce the po­ten­tial of peo­ple con­tract­ing the flu and Covid-19 si­mul­ta­ne­ously and crip­pling health­care sys­tems.</p>
    <p>With a sec­ond or third wave of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic loom­ing for many coun­tries, tack­ling this year’s flu sea­son – typ­i­cally from De­cem­ber to Fe­bru­ary – has taken on in­creased ur­gency.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, the Health Min­istry is pre­par­ing 31.2 mil­lion flu shots, up 7 per cent from last year and the most since 2015. Of­fi­cials are also urg­ing symp­to­matic pa­tients to call med­i­cal hot­lines be­fore go­ing for testing to avoid con­ta­gion at hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>“We are go­ing to focus our med­i­cal re­sources on the se­verely ill in an­tic­i­pa­tion of the sea­sonal in­fluenza epi­demic,” Dr Takeshi Enami, a Ja­panese Health Min­istry of­fi­cial, said last week after a meet­ing of dis­ease ex­perts.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has urged wide­spread flu vac­ci­na­tions this year, amid con­cerns that the same peo­ple who are most vul­ner­a­ble to risks from Covid-19, such as the el­derly and those with res­pi­ra­tory con­di­tions, are also at great­est risk for the flu.</p>
    <p>Data on the num­ber of an­nual flu cases across Asia is lim­ited, al­though Ja­pan had about 12 mil­lion cases in the 2018/19 sea­son, ac­cord­ing to an of­fi­cial source.</p>
    <p>In South Korea, the health au­thor­i­ties are procur­ing 30 mil­lion flu vac­cines for the win­ter sea­son, up 20 per cent from last year.</p>
    <p>Around 19 mil­lion peo­ple will be in­oc­u­lated for free, cov­er­ing a third of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion, up from 13.8 mil­lion a year ago. Of­fi­cials are also ex­tend­ing the de­mo­graphic win­dow for free vac­ci­na­tion this year, cov­er­ing chil­dren from six months to 18, adults over 61 and preg­nant women.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s big­gest flu vac­cine maker GC Pharma told Reuters it will make over 10 mil­lion flu shots for this sea­son, up from the 8.5 mil­lion doses last year.</p>
    <p>In Tai­wan, the gov­ern­ment said it views the sea­sonal flu and the coro­n­avirus as two sep­a­rate con­cerns as they can con­trol Covid-19 with ex­ist­ing strict rules, in­clud­ing manda­tory quar­an­tines.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said late last month that they planned to pro­vide more than six mil­lion free doses this year.</p>
    <p>In China, where flu shots are typ­i­cally not free, some lo­cal au­thor­i­ties have re­ported a surge in de­mand. Dis­ease preven­tion au­thor­i­ties in the Changn­ing dis­trict of Shang­hai city said they ex­pect de­mand for flu vac­cines in the au­tumn and win­ter to in­crease some 50 per cent from pre­vi­ous years.</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia, where the flu sea­son runs roughly from June to Septem­ber, of­fi­cials pro­cured 16.5 mil­lion flu shots, up from 13.2 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>The moves in Asia echo sim­i­lar ef­forts in North Amer­ica and Europe.</p>
    <p>In the United States, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms are ex­pected to pro­vide around 200 mil­lion flu vac­cines this year, about 20 per cent more than usual.</p>
