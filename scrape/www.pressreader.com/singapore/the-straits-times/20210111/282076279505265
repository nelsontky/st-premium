    <p>Teacher Alvin Yap, 35, takes GoPro videos of his fam­ily when they go on out­ings.</p>
    <p>So he made sure to doc­u­ment his three-year-old son Al­phus’ first visit to Univer­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore (USS) on Dec 21.</p>
    <p>His wife Paige Chia, a 35-yearold bank ex­ec­u­tive, had used her $100 Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers to buy two adult tick­ets and one child ticket for their sev­enyear-old daugh­ter Ash­ley, top­ping up the re­main­der in cash.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren un­der four years old, like Al­phus, can en­ter USS free.</p>
    <p>On the day of the out­ing, there was a driz­zle and, as a re­sult, some of the rides had to be closed tem­po­rar­ily for safety rea­sons.</p>
    <p>In fact, it had been a wet, windy week, and the night be­fore their Sen­tosa ad­ven­ture, the chil­dren had prayed that it would not rain, said Mr Yap.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily queued in the rain for more than 40 min­utes so Al­phus could take his first roller­coaster ride on Puss In Boots’ Gi­ant Jour­ney.</p>
    <p>“He was very ex­cited and even though a large part of the crowd left (be­cause of the rain), we de­cided to stay put,” said Mr Yap.</p>
    <p>A spe­cial mo­ment he doc­u­mented on video was his chil­dren’s meet­ing with the Min­ions.</p>
    <p>Both of them are fans of the De­spi­ca­ble Me movie fran­chise, which fea­tures the Min­ions char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Yap: “The Min­ions came out in Christ­mas cos­tumes and they re­ally brought up our spir­its.”</p>
    <p>For him, cap­tur­ing all that on video was worth­while as the fam­ily can re­live the pre­cious mem­o­ries.</p>
    <p>“My daugh­ter is seven now, but she can still see what hap­pened when she was three or four,” he said.</p>
    <p>Since Septem­ber last year, house­wife Low Fang Ting, 34, has been tak­ing her three chil­dren out on tours to learn more about the city’s unique precincts.</p>
    <p>Most re­cently, they went on a two-hour-long out­ing in Lit­tle In­dia, or­gan­ised by tour op­er­a­tor Mon­ster Day Tours.</p>
    <p>Although walk­ing tours, like cy­cling and kayak­ing trips, can have up to 20 par­tic­i­pants, Ms Low and her three chil­dren – Ash­ley, two, Caleb, four and Hayley, five – were the only ones on the tour.</p>
    <p>“My tour guide could re­ally cater to our needs. We skipped a few places when my chil­dren were tired from walk­ing. He could also an­swer all their ques­tions,” said Ms Low.</p>
    <p>One high­light was vis­it­ing a cof­fee shop in Lit­tle In­dia where her guide or­dered cha­p­ati for them for break­fast.</p>
    <p>“It was my chil­dren’s first time try­ing this. They are not so used to the spicy taste but they liked it,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Low paid $50 for her Lit­tle In­dia tour tick­ets which she bought from Glob­alTix us­ing Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily also vis­ited The New World arch lo­cated out­side the Far­rer Park MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>“It was nos­tal­gic for me, hav­ing seen this in movies. I could also tell the kids that their grand­par­ents vis­ited the New World Amuse­ment Park in the old days,” she said.</p>
    <p>She is on the look­out for a tour in Chi­na­town after the Chi­nese New Year dec­o­ra­tions have been put up.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, she vis­ited Kam­pong Glam with her chil­dren and hus­band, also with Mon­ster Day Tours.</p>
    <p>“I pre­fer cul­tural tours. It’s an ed­u­ca­tional op­por­tu­nity for my chil­dren. And they are learn­ing about ra­cial har­mony in schools,” she said.</p>
