    <p>Cleve­land will see US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and for­mer vicepres­i­dent Joe Bi­den go head to head for the first time on the same stage, amid a bit­terly ac­ri­mo­nious cam­paign in a dan­ger­ously di­vided United States.</p>
    <p>The first of three pres­i­den­tial de­bates – at 9am to­mor­row Sin­ga­pore time – will be a chal­lenge prin­ci­pally for Mr Bi­den. While he is con­sis­tently, if nar­rowly, lead­ing in na­tional polls, Mr Bi­den is pitch­ing him­self as the anti-Trump, who will bring de­cency, com­pas­sion and unity back to Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>But he also faces ac­cu­sa­tions of be­ing weak and unin­spir­ing. He has staged far fewer in-per­son cam­paign events than Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>He also faces a Pres­i­dent skilled in the arts of blud­geon­ing ri­vals and play­ing to the gallery of his own nar­row but de­voted base.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is likely to be the tar­get of well-aimed barbs over the con­duct of his son, Hunter Bi­den, who is al­leged to have ben­e­fited from his fa­ther be­ing vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The flip side is that ex­pec­ta­tions of Mr Bi­den are rel­a­tively low, so a pass­able per­for­mance will im­press.</p>
    <p>Also, he comes into the de­bate on the heels of po­ten­tially dam­ag­ing rev­e­la­tions, in an ap­par­ently ex­ten­sively re­searched New York Times ar­ti­cle, that Mr Trump has been pay­ing star­tlingly low in­come tax on his fam­ily busi­ness em­pire.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent, while de­flect­ing blame to China, is also vul­ner­a­ble on his pan­demic record; last week, Amer­ica passed the grim mile­stone of 200,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Un­like Mr Trump, who con­sid­ers his al­most daily prickly ex­changes with re­porters as ad­e­quate train­ing, Mr Bi­den has been pre­par­ing ex­ten­sively for the de­bates. Af­ter Ohio, they will meet in Florida on Oct 15 and in Ten­nessee on Oct 22.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Trump will def­i­nitely try to throw the (for­mer) vice-pres­i­dent a bunch of curve­balls that are de­signed to get him off his game,” Mr Jay Car­ney, who was Mr Bi­den’s com­mu­ni­ca­tions di­rec­tor and also White House press sec­re­tary un­der pres­i­dent Barack Obama, told Bloomberg News.</p>
    <p>“(Mr Bi­den) fully ex­pects and is pre­par­ing for that and knows that tak­ing that bait is not what he wants to do,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month at a fundraiser, Mr Bi­den said: “I hope I don’t get baited into get­ting into a brawl with this guy.” He added: “It’s go­ing to be hard, be­cause I pre­dict he’s go­ing to be shout­ing.”</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Mr Bi­den told MSNBC that Mr Trump “doesn’t</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is likely to be the tar­get of well-aimed barbs over the con­duct of his son, Hunter Bi­den, who is al­leged to have ben­e­fited from his fa­ther be­ing vice-pres­i­dent. The flip side is that ex­pec­ta­tions of Mr Bi­den are rel­a­tively low, so a pass­able per­for­mance will im­press.</p>
    <p>know how to de­bate the facts. He’s not that smart. He doesn’t know that many facts. He doesn’t know much about for­eign pol­icy. He doesn’t know much about do­mes­tic pol­icy. He doesn’t know much about the de­tail”.</p>
    <p>In an av­er­age of na­tional polls main­tained by the po­lit­i­cal analysis web­site FiveThir­tyEight, Mr Bi­den has a roughly seven-point, 50.3 per cent to 43 per cent, lead over Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>But six states – Florida, Ge­or­gia, North Carolina, Ari­zona, Wis­con­sin and Ohio – are con­sid­ered toss-ups, which is alarm­ing for Mr Bi­den as it in­di­cates that Mr Trump could re­peat his 2016 tri­umph, in which he lost the pop­u­lar vote but won a hand­ful of key states to win the al­limpor­tant Elec­toral Col­lege.</p>
    <p>The 90-minute de­bate at Case West­ern Re­serve Univer­sity and Cleve­land Clinic will be mod­er­ated by Fox News host Chris Wal­lace.</p>
    <p>The top­ics, each of which will get about 15 min­utes, are Mr Trump’s and Mr Bi­den’s records; the Supreme Court; the han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic; the econ­omy, race and vi­o­lence in Amer­i­can cities; and the in­tegrity of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>An ob­vi­ous omis­sion, climate change, will al­most cer­tainly fig­ure in sub­se­quent de­bates.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of the Supreme Court has been thrown into sharp fo­cus with the death of Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg, an icon for lib­er­als and the left, and Mr Trump’s nom­i­na­tion last week of Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett, a dar­ling of re­li­gious con­ser­va­tives, to fill the va­cancy.</p>
    <p>He is in­tent on Mrs Bar­rett’s con­fir­ma­tion be­fore the elec­tion to ce­ment what would then be a prin­ci­pal do­mes­tic le­gacy – pack­ing the court with con­ser­va­tives.</p>
    <p>The last topic is also fraught, and not un­con­nected with the push to fill the seat left va­cant by Jus­tice Gins­burg.</p>
    <p>Many an­a­lysts see Amer­ica bar</p>
    <p>relling to­wards a con­sti­tu­tional cri­sis and pos­si­ble vi­o­lence if, as seems likely, the re­sult of the elec­tion is ei­ther mud­died by a long, drawn-out process in­volv­ing court bat­tles, or sim­ply not ac­cepted by one or the other can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has re­peat­edly and ex­plic­itly ques­tioned the in­tegrity of mail-in bal­lots, which have al­ways been a fea­ture of Amer­i­can elec­tions – in some states more than oth­ers – and in this elec­tion as­sume greater im­por­tance given the risk of min­gling in queues and groups in the midst of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He has stated more than once that the only way he can lose is if the elec­tion is “rigged”.</p>
    <p>Like heavy­weight wrestling matches, the pres­i­den­tial de­bates are part of the show­biz of Amer­i­can pol­i­tics, an ecosys­tem in which Mr Trump, a for­mer re­al­ity tele­vi­sion star, thrives.</p>
    <p>As a long-time sen­a­tor and a veteran of the Barack Obama cam­paigns, Mr Bi­den’s ex­pe­ri­ence of de­bates is very sub­stan­tial – but more tra­di­tional.</p>
    <p>“De­bates don’t re­ward folks who speak in com­plete sen­tences and long para­graphs,” Mr Car­ney said.</p>
    <p>“They re­ally re­ward one-lin­ers and in­sults and zingers.”</p>
