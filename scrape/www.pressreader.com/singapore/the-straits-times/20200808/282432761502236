    <p>BREAK­ING THE WALL</p>
    <p>The first leg was a dif­fi­cult game for us, they (Napoli) put a lot of men be­hind the ball and it was not our best game or re­sult but I be­lieve we can do bet­ter against them now. ’’</p>
    <p>FRENKIE DE JONG, Barcelona mid­fielder, on their Cham­pi­ons League last-16, sec­ond-leg tie against Napoli to­day.</p>
    <p>• Af­ter hav­ing three weeks to rest and process their tur­bu­lent end to the do­mes­tic cam­paign, Barcelona re­turn to ac­tion in to­day’s Cham­pi­ons League last-16, sec­ond-leg tie at home to Napoli, with Quique Se­tien’s fu­ture on the line.</p>
    <p>The tie is finely bal­anced at 1-1, with the win­ners earn­ing a ticket to the “fi­nal eight” knock­out tour­na­ment in Lis­bon next week, Uefa’s so­lu­tion to a com­pe­ti­tion dis­rupted by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Even though the draw in Naples in Fe­bru­ary was not the worst re­sult for Barca, their per­for­mance was slammed by cap­tain Lionel Messi, who de­clared they would have no hope of win­ning their fifth Euro­pean Cup if they con­tin­ued to play as they did.</p>
    <p>His damn­ing as­sess­ment came home to roost when the sea­son restarted in June af­ter the coro­n­avirus stop­page and Barca sur­ren­dered the Span­ish La Liga ti­tle to Real Madrid, prompt­ing the for­ward to launch a new tirade.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gen­tinian’s out­burst was in­ter­preted as a swipe against Se­tien, who had never man­aged a team in the Cham­pi­ons League un­til he suc­ceeded Ernesto Valverde in Jan­uary and ended the league cam­paign shorn of credit.</p>
    <p>Even though club pres­i­dent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu gave the coach a vote of con­fi­dence ahead of the sec­ond leg, it is im­pos­si­ble to see him sur­viv­ing an elim­i­na­tion by</p>
    <p>Napoli as it would mean Barca’s first tro­phy­less sea­son since 2008.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, the Cham­pi­ons League has been an ob­ses­sion for the team ever since their last tri­umph in 2015, so much so that Valverde was dis­missed due to his in­abil­ity to steer the team to Euro­pean glory even though he led them to backto-back league ti­tles.</p>
    <p>The Cata­lan giants will be without the sus­pended Ser­gio Bus­quets and Ar­turo Vi­dal, but have been boosted by the re­turn of Frenkie de Jong, Ous­mane Dem­bele and An­toine Griez­mann from in­jury.</p>
    <p>“The first leg was a dif­fi­cult game for us, they (Napoli) put a lot of men be­hind the ball and it was not our best game or re­sult but I be­lieve we can do bet­ter against them now,” Dutch mid­fielder de Jong told Barca’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Napoli, mean­while, are sweat­ing on the fit­ness of for­ward Lorenzo In­signe af­ter he hurt a thigh mus­cle in his team’s last match of Serie A, in which they came sev­enth, their worst do­mes­tic fin­ish in the Ital­ian league since 2009.</p>
