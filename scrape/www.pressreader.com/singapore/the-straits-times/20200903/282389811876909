    <p>•</p>
    <p>Next month’s World Golf Cham­pi­onship-HSBC Cham­pi­ons in Shang­hai, won last year by Rory McIl­roy, has been axed be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, wip­ing out this year’s Asian swing of the PGA Tour.</p>
    <p>The event, which last year had the largest prize fund of any tour­na­ment out­side the US or Ma­jors at US$10.25 mil­lion (S$13.95 mil­lion), is co-sanc­tioned by the PGA, Euro­pean and Asian Tours.</p>
    <p>It had been sched­uled to take place from Oct 29 to Nov 1 at the She­shan In­ter­na­tional Golf Club and was the fi­nal stop on the PGA’s Tour’s US$29.75 mil­lion, three­event Asian swing.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic has laid waste to the high­light of the Asian golf cal­en­dar, with South Korea’s CJ Cup and Ja­pan’s Zozo Cham­pi­onship re­lo­cated to cour­ses in the US.</p>
    <p>All in­ter­na­tional sports events in China have been can­celled for at least the rest of this year be­cause of the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“We’ve worked ex­ten­sively with all tours, in­ter­na­tional of­fi­cials, the China Golf As­so­ci­a­tion and other lo­cal par­ties to find a so­lu­tion to host the WGC-HSBC Cham­pi­ons,” said Ty Votaw, the PGA Tour’s vice-pres­i­dent of in­ter­na­tional op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“In line with Chi­nese gov­ern­ment guide­lines and be­ing mind­ful of the lo­gis­ti­cal im­pli­ca­tions, we col­lec­tively made the dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion to can­cel the 2020 event.”</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the US$9.75 mil­lion Zozo event, which was launched last year and mem­o­rably won by Tiger Woods for a record-equalling 82nd PGA Tour vic­tory, was moved to Sher­wood Coun­try Club in Thou­sand Oaks, Cal­i­for­nia. It will be held from Oct 22-25.</p>
    <p>The CJ Cup, which has the same prize fund as its Ja­panese coun­ter­part and was won by Justin Thomas last year, will be staged in Las Ve­gas from Oct 15-18 rather than its usual lo­cale of Jeju Is­land. Both tour­na­ments will be held be­hind closed doors.</p>
