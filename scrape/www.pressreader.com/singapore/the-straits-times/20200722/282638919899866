    <p>Tai­wanese ac­tress and singer-song­writer Shadya Lan has filed for a pro­tec­tion or­der against her ex-hus­band Tong En­ning, re­ported Ori­en­tal Daily News.</p>
    <p>Lan, 35, mar­ried the chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer of a tech­nol­ogy com­pany in 2012. They have a daugh­ter, nick­named Tong Tong.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the cou­ple called it quits last year due to com­pat­i­bil­ity is­sues, end­ing nearly seven years of mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Since the di­vorce, Mr Tong has posted many al­le­ga­tions against his former spouse on Face­book. He wrote in one: “Re­gret­tably, six years have passed and we could not go on any longer. I have tried my best to take care of this family, but you weren’t pre­pared for mar­ried life.”</p>
    <p>He ac­cused the singer of “treat­ing home like a school dor­mi­tory”, al­leg­ing that she would spend half her time at home and the other half at her friend’s house.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong also com­plained that al­though he of­ten en­cour­aged her in her ca­reer, he did not feel ac­knowl­edged: “You of­ten thank so many people in your speeches, but not once have you men­tioned my name.”</p>
    <p>He added that her fo­cus on her ca­reer made her ne­glect her daugh­ter, and ac­cused her of pre­fer­ring her friends to her daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ori­en­tal Daily News, Lan has de­nied Mr Tong’s ac­cu­sa­tions, say­ing: “It’s re­gret­table that my ef­forts in our mar­riage have not been felt.”</p>
    <p>The singer has filed for a pro­tec­tion or­der as the ver­bal abuse from Mr Tong dur­ing and af­ter their mar­riage had be­come “in­tol­er­a­ble”.</p>
