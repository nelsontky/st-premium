    <p>Mambo Jambo in Las Ve­gas?</p>
    <p>Along with the Zouk Group’s night­club and food and bev­er­age con­cepts, the quintessen­tially Sin­ga­porean, retro-themed club night could be mak­ing its way to Sin City.</p>
    <p>The group is slated to open a multi-con­cept com­plex in Re­sorts World Las Ve­gas next sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Its con­cepts will oc­cupy 100,000 sq ft of space in the US$4.3 bil­lion (S$5.8 bil­lion) in­te­grated re­sort, which will be the Las Ve­gas Strip’s first de­vel­op­ment to be built from the ground up in over a decade.</p>
    <p>It marks the 29-year-old home­grown life­style and entertainm­ent group’s first foray into the United States, and its most am­bi­tious ven­ture yet.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing ex­clu­sively to The Straits Times, chief ex­ec­u­tive An­drew Li says: “When Gent­ing Hong Kong ac­quired Zouk in 2015, it was al­ways the plan to build this life­style port­fo­lio un­der the Gent­ing Group, so this part­ner­ship with Re­sorts World Las Ve­gas is the next tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“There’s al­most 30 years of his­tory, brand DNA and legacy with Zouk, and we can bring some­thing spe­cial to this al­ready quite momentous project.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral tried-and-tested con­cepts by Zouk in Sin­ga­pore and Gent­ing High­lands, Malaysia, will be set up in Las Ve­gas – namely the “best of brands ac­cu­mu­lated over the last five years”, says Mr Li.</p>
    <p>Be­sides recre­at­ing the i conic Zouk Night­club, the group will also open the third out­let of so­cial gam­ing bar RedTail – where guests can en­joy pre­mium beer, wine, cock­tails and shared plates while play­ing games like beer pong, darts and pool.</p>
    <p>Zouk Gent­ing’s “vibe din­ing” con­cept Fuhu – a high-en­ergy, ex­pe­ri­en­tial din­ing venue that serves con­tem­po­rary Asian cui­sine – will also go to Las Ve­gas.</p>
    <p>The new AYU day­club, on the other hand, will be an all-day, out­door venue in­spired by South-east Asia’s idyl­lic is­lands.</p>
    <p>Zouk Sin­ga­pore’s lessons from the pan­demic – in­clud­ing turn­ing its club space at Clarke Quay into a spin stu­dio and cin­ema – will also be ap­plied to the Las Ve­gas com­plex.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has made us think what else we can do, be­cause night­clubs in the day are mas­sive un­used space that have so many pos­si­bil­i­ties,” says Mr Li.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the venues within Re­sorts World Las Ve­gas, he adds that the con­cepts that Zouk is bring­ing in will com­ple­ment one an­other and pro­vide “var­i­ous touch points (for the guest to en­joy) from the start of the day till the end”.</p>
    <p>And that is the edge Mr Scott Si­bella, pres­i­dent of Re­sorts World Las Ve­gas, feels they have over es­tab­lished play­ers like Wynn Las Ve­gas, The Cos­mopoli­tan and The Vene­tian on the crowded Strip.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated on the north end of the Strip, the re­sort, which will house two 66-storey ho­tel tow­ers with 3,500 rooms in to­tal, is be­ing built on an 35.6ha site by Gent­ing Ber­had. It will also have a 5,000-seat theatre, 350,000 sq ft of con­ven­tion space and a 2.2ha pool com­plex.</p>
    <p>“Given its size, you never have to leave the prop­erty and that’s not some­thing you see a lot of on the Strip,” Mr Si­bella notes.</p>
    <p>“We feel com­fort­able that it hasn’t been done this way and we don’t have to sur­vive off j ust Satur­day night’s tak­ings.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “From what Zouk can bring here in terms of its cul­ture and brand of Asian hos­pi­tal­ity, maybe we can change the way it’s pro­grammed in Las Ve­gas, where the venues could see ev­ery­thing from a band or a DJ play­ing, or be used for con­ven­tions and hos­pi­tal­ity... There will be some­thing for ev­ery­body.”</p>
    <p>Both Zouk Group and Re­sorts World Las Ve­gas are op­ti­mistic about open­ing next sum­mer, even with the un­cer­tain­ties of the pan­demic, which is still plagu­ing many parts of the world.</p>
    <p>Mr Li says: “When you look at places like China and Tai­wan, where they’ve things un­der con­trol, life is back to nor­mal, and you see that peo­ple crave so­cial in­ter­ac­tion and entertainm­ent.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter all this pent-up frus­tra­tion from the pan­demic, it will be a great time to open... This world-class prop­erty is new and ready to wel­come back peo­ple to Las Ve­gas.”</p>
