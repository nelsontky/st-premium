    <p>CASH­LESS DILEMMA IN CABS</p>
    <p>With the Gov­ern­ment push­ing for a cash­less so­ci­ety and en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to use e-pay­ment sys­tems even in hawker cen­tres, I won­der why cabs make it dif­fi­cult to use the same method of pay­ment. Com­fortDelGro charges a fee for us­ing credit cards. I think it is time for us to move for­ward and elim­i­nate this re­luc­tance to change our mind­set.</p>
    <p>WHY IS CRUISE TO NOWHERE OK?</p>
    <p>When Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) wanted to launch flights to nowhere, there was an up­roar from en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists and cer­tain quar­ters about car­bon emis­sions as well as Covid-19 in­fec­tion con­cerns. But when it comes to cruises to nowhere, the near ab­sence of push­back is baf­fling. Don’t cruises to nowhere emit car­bon and are they im­mune to Covid-19 risks?</p>
    <p>Or should SIA launch a “casino in the air” in­stead, to gain ac­cep­tance? Why the glar­ing dou­ble stan­dards?</p>

    <p>HEL­METS VI­TAL WHEN CYCLING</p>
    <p>The case of the maid who was se­ri­ously in­jured dur­ing a cycling trip on Pu­lau Ubin could have been avoided (Maid suf­fers head in­jury dur­ing cycling trip at Ubin, Oct 11).</p>
    <p>The manda­tory wear­ing of a hel­met when cycling should be ex­tended to foot­paths or off-road paths be­fore more se­ri­ous in­juries or loss of lives. I have also no­ticed that many of the food de­liv­ery rid­ers on bi­cy­cles, who cy­cle at top speed to de­liver food on time, do not wear hel­mets.</p>

    <p>LOWER BUS FARE FOR SE­NIORS</p>
    <p>The pub­lic bus fare for se­nior cit­i­zens is 59 cents for the first 3.2km.</p>
    <p>Most se­nior cit­i­zens travel to the wet market, hawker cen­tre or poly­clinic, usu­ally within a 2km dis­tance from their homes. If bus com­pa­nies re­duce the fare to 30 cents for the first 1.5km, it would def­i­nitely help to re­duce trans­porta­tion costs for most se­nior cit­i­zens. I hope the bus com­pa­nies will con­sider this. It would help de­fray trans­port costs for many se­nior cit­i­zens.</p>

    <p>CARS WITH LOUD EN­GINE A NUI­SANCE</p>
    <p>I ap­pre­ci­ate the work by the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity in mon­i­tor­ing and ap­pre­hend­ing speed­sters on our roads. We should also catch those with noisy mod­i­fied en­gines. We should have noise sen­sors on some high­ways and roads to catch these peo­ple – espe­cially on the East Coast Park­way and Still Road com­ing from Jalan Eunos, ev­ery Fri­day and Satur­day.</p>

    <p>CHARGED BY SINGTEL FOR NO SER­VICE</p>
    <p>My Singtel TV pack sub­scrip­tion ex­pired and there is no con­tract at­tached to it. I con­tacted cus­tomer ser­vice to ter­mi­nate the the sub­scrip­tion and was told to take the set-top box to one of the four Singtel cen­tres.</p>
    <p>There, I was told it would take 14 work­ing days for the telco to process the ter­mi­na­tion and that I would be charged for the du­ra­tion of that pro­cess­ing pe­riod. Why should I be pay­ing for this when the equip­ment has al­ready been re­turned and I no longer have any ac­cess to the TV ser­vice?</p>
