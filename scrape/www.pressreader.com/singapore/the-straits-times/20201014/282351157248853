    <p>It was July 6, 2008. Bri­tish Grand Prix won, Lewis Hamil­ton headed home lis­ten­ing to ra­dio com­men­tary of the Wim­ble­don men’s sin­gles fi­nal. He caught half an hour of the 4hr 48min clas­sic – enough to recog­nise that he and Rafael Nadal are cut from the same cloth.</p>
    <p>The Bri­ton, then 23, said af­ter Nadal de­feated Roger Fed­erer for his first All Eng­land crown: “Nadal had never tasted it, and for me I can prob­a­bly iden­tify with his hunger to win that first ti­tle. I’ve had the hunger since I was a five- or six-year-old. It’s al­ways been there, and I think (it) al­ways will be.”</p>
    <p>Win­ning has not di­min­ished their ap­petites 4,480 days later. On Sun­day, Hamil­ton and Nadal equalled all-time records be­long­ing to Michael Schu­macher (91 race wins) and Fed­erer (20 Grand Slam ti­tles), with LeBron James com­plet­ing the his­toric 12-hour span by be­com­ing the first to win three Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player awards with three teams.</p>
    <p>They could all be kin­dred spir­its, even if they ap­pear to be from vastly dif­fer­ent worlds.</p>
    <p>Kids here are un­likely to have Hamil­ton’s ac­cess to a multi-mil­lion dol­lar ma­chine, Nadal’s sport­ing lin­eage or grow up to boast James’ physique. But they can em­u­late their work ethic, com­mit­ment to their craft, and never-say-die at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>Nadal goes to bat­tle alone; James looks to bring the best out of his LA Lak­ers team­mates, Hamil­ton plots to de­feat his. The ten­nis and bas­ket­ball stars are con­fronted by court di­men­sions that never change; the For­mula One racer nav­i­gates unique cir­cuits. James and Hamil­ton ad­justed to dif­fer­ent teams; Nadal dif­fer­ent sur­faces.</p>
    <p>Yet that thirst to al­ways be bet­ter to­mor­row runs through them.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­ing they turned pro­fes­sional 19 (Nadal), 17 (James) and 13 years (Hamil­ton) ago, that’s a whole lot of fine-tun­ing.</p>
    <p>Nadal won a French Open in Oc­to­ber in colder con­di­tions that caused the ball to bounce much lower than when he first lifted the Mus­ke­teers’ Cup in 2005. Hamil­ton won his first ti­tle in 2008 with a V8 en­gine and his lat­est with a V6. James, with his home­town Cleve­land Cava­liers, found a way to over­come the Golden State War­riors, the su­per team with three All-Stars, in 2016 for the third of his four cham­pi­onships.</p>
    <p>Im­prove­ment is what’s nec­es­sary to reach and stay at the top.</p>
    <p>Nadal is the first man in the Open era to win a Grand Slam ti­tle 15 years af­ter his first one at Roland Gar­ros.</p>
    <p>There are 11 years be­tween Hamil­ton’s maiden and most re­cent ti­tle – the long­est gap in F1 history. James, 35, has never missed a play-off game. His 260 post-sea­son games since 2007 are the most ever and his 10 Fi­nals ap­pear­ances are more than 27 of the 30 NBA fran­chises.</p>
    <p>But as great as they are, few saw such great­ness com­ing. Doubts sur­faced faster than the Twit­terati could type: James has it easy in the East, he can’t carry a team in the West. Hamil­ton is win­ning only be­cause he’s driv­ing the fastest car. (He has out­per­formed team­mate Val­terri Bot­tas 8-3 in qual­i­fy­ing and races this sea­son.) Nadal’s knees would never hold up into his 30s. The only time those 34-year-old knees buck­led on Sun­day was af­ter a 6-0, 6-2, 7-5 beat­down of world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic, not pre­vi­ously de­feated by an op­po­nent this year.</p>
    <p>They are united in their abil­ity to stay mo­ti­vated and that sets them apart.</p>
    <p>Kids here are un­likely to have Hamil­ton’s ac­cess to a multi-mil­lion dol­lar ma­chine, Nadal’s sport­ing lin­eage or grow up to boast James’ physique. But they can em­u­late their work ethic, com­mit­ment to their craft, and never-say-die at­ti­tude.</p>
    <p>James’ 2016 Cava­liers are the only team to over­come a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Fi­nals. Nadal only has one gear and it’s high, as Hamil­ton re­alised in 2008. That year, at the last cor­ner of the last lap of the last race of the sea­son, Hamil­ton over­took a ri­val to be­come the youngest F1 world cham­pion.</p>
    <p>Twelve years on, the chase for a sev­enth ti­tle is gath­er­ing pace. He’s close to the fin­ish line. James and Nadal can­not even see one yet.</p>
