    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Bos­ton for­ward Jayson Ta­tum rel­ished the moment he banked in a game-win­ning three pointer over Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo with 1.5 sec­onds left to give the Celtics a 122-121 Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son-open­ing vic­tory over the Mil­wau­kee Bucks on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo, the two-time de­fend­ing NBA Most Valu­able Player, had a chance to tie it from the free-throw line with four­tenths of a se­cond left, but the Greek su­per­star missed his se­cond free throw af­ter be­ing fouled at the rim and the Celtics came away with the win on their home floor.</p>
    <p>“Ever since I was a kid I wanted to be in that po­si­tion,” Ta­tum said of step­ping up de­spite a rel­a­tively poor shoot­ing night.</p>
    <p>“If it goes down or not, that’s what I work so hard for. You just want to be in that moment.”</p>
    <p>He fin­ished with 30 points but con­nected on just 12 of 28 shots from the floor.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what my field goal per­cent­age was, but I know I played ter­ri­ble,” added Ta­tum, who also pulled down seven re­bounds and handed out two as­sists.</p>
    <p>“But it’s a team game. Ev­ery­body con­trib­uted. It’s the first one of the sea­son, so it felt good to get a win.”</p>
    <p>Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 33 points, five re­bounds and four as­sists.</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo, who last week signed a five-year con­tract ex­ten­sion re­port­edly worth a record US$228 mil­lion (S$303 mil­lion), led Mil­wau­kee with 35 points, 13 re­bounds, two as­sists and two blocks.</p>
    <p>Khris Mid­dle­ton had 27 points and 14 re­bounds for the Bucks, who fin­ished the 2019-20 reg­u­lar sea­son with the best record in the NBA but fell to the Mi­ami Heat in the Eastern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>Prized off-sea­son ac­qui­si­tion Jrue Hol­i­day added 25 points.</p>
    <p>De­spite the end re­sult, An­te­tok­oun­mpo led his team back from a 101-84 deficit to be­gin the fourth.</p>
    <p>The Bucks opened the quar­ter with a 13-4 run to close the gap to 105-97, and An­te­tok­oun­mpo scored Mil­wau­kee’s next 10 points, trim­ming the deficit to two. A Brook Lopez tip-in with 4min 22sec left tied the score at 113.</p>
    <p>An­te­tok­oun­mpo put the Bucks ahead 115-113 with 3:26 re­main­ing, but Ta­tum had the Celtics back up 119-117 on a fade­away with 1:24 to go.</p>
    <p>Hol­i­day’s three-pointer at 1:10 made it 120-119 to Mil­wau­kee, and the game re­mained score­less un­til Ta­tum’s game-win­ning bucket.</p>
    <p>“I think aside from the ball go­ing in the bas­ket, I’m not sure we could have de­fended Ta­tum much bet­ter than we did,” Bucks coach Mike Bu­den­holzer said on ESPN.</p>
    <p>“I thought Gian­nis did a great job in­di­vid­u­ally, great con­test. Credit to Ta­tum, he banked in a three at the end of the clock.”</p>
