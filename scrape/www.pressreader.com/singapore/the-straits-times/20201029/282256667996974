    <p>• Nico Ros­berg hailed Lewis Hamil­ton’s record 92nd For­mula One vic­tory and sport­ing longevity as a great achieve­ment on Tues­day but said the way the Bri­ton was us­ing his plat­form to raise aware­ness for global is­sues was just as im­pres­sive.</p>
    <p>The pair were team­mates and fierce ri­vals at Mercedes from 2013 un­til 2016, with the Ger­man re­tir­ing af­ter win­ning his maiden cham­pi­onship that year.</p>
    <p>Ros­berg was also a team­mate of Michael Schu­macher, whose record Hamil­ton broke in Por­tu­gal last Sun­day, from 2010-12 af­ter the Fer­rari great re­turned to the sport with the Sil­ver Ar­rows fol­low­ing a four-year ab­sence.</p>
    <p>“I have huge re­spect for what he’s man­aged to achieve,” Ros­berg told Reuters af­ter a launch for the Ex­treme E off-road elec­tric se­ries that starts next year with both men en­ter­ing teams.</p>
    <p>“One thing is be­ing at the level that he’s at, just a phe­nom­e­nal driver, but then to stick in there and year in, year out, stay at that high level and be the guy to beat ev­ery year and still dom­i­nate, that’s just so hard.</p>
    <p>“It surely will go down as one of the great­est sport­ing achievemen­ts in gen­eral, not only in F1, across all sports. I can just take my hat off to him.”</p>
    <p>Ros­berg also said he was also “su­per proud” of hav­ing beaten some­one des­tined to be­come the most suc­cess­ful F1 driver of all time.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton is odds-on to equal Schu­macher’s record of seven cham­pi­onships this sea­son and few would bet against him next term.</p>
    <p>Ros­berg claimed that it was im­pos­si­ble to de­cide be­tween Schu­macher and Hamil­ton in terms of great­ness and would put them as equals.</p>
    <p>“At the same time, I think it’s re­ally cool how Lewis is us­ing his plat­form and aware­ness to do good in the world. He’s re­ally look­ing for­ward, think­ing about the fu­ture... I also have huge re­spect for that,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Amongst all this crazi­ness of be­com­ing the best of all time in F1, he still has ca­pac­ity to think of the greater pic­ture and that I re­spect maybe even more.”</p>
    <p>As F1’s only black driver, Hamil­ton has been cam­paign­ing for racial jus­tice while wear­ing a Black Lives Mat­ter T-shirt and tak­ing a knee be­fore races this cam­paign.</p>
    <p>He has also spo­ken about po­lice vi­o­lence in Nige­ria and as a ve­gan and en­vi­ron­men­tal­ist, he has pushed for an­i­mal wel­fare, while set­ting up a com­mis­sion to make mo­tor sport more di­verse.</p>
    <p>Ex­treme E is a se­ries that aims to high­light the ef­fects of cli­mate change by rac­ing in ex­treme en­vi­ron­ments and is Hamil­ton’s first ven­ture as a team owner. While nei­ther he nor Ros­berg will be driv­ing, they share a com­mon sense of pur­pose.</p>
    <p>“I want to be in sus­tain­able rac­ing. I want to be in mo­tor sport where the plat­form is be­ing used to drive pos­i­tive change,” said Ros­berg. “That is the most im­por­tant and cru­cial el­e­ment for me, that we’re not just en­ter­tain­ing but we’re driv­ing change.</p>
    <p>“We’re us­ing the plat­form to in­no­vate tech­nol­ogy, to raise aware­ness, for ex­am­ple for cli­mate change.”</p>
