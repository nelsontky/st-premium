    <p>Your op­por­tu­nity to feel like a fash­ion ed­i­tor is here, at Sin­ga­pore’s first vir­tual fash­ion fes­ti­val, The Front Row.</p>
    <p>Con­cep­tu­alised by fash­ion vet­eran Daniel Boey, 55, the fes­ti­val recre­ates a fash­ion week ex­pe­ri­ence on­line at the­fron­trow.style. The event kicked off yes­ter­day and will run till Aug 29.</p>
    <p>The on­line por­tal houses a 3D fes­ti­val vil­lage which visi­tors can nav­i­gate to vir­tu­ally at­tend run­way shows, pan­els, work­shops and pod­casts.</p>
    <p>On show are 31 lo­cal and 10 re­gional la­bels – “de­sign­ers we felt have the pulse on the fu­ture, who know how to adapt no mat­ter what the econ­omy throws at them”, Boey tells The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>From his of­fice i n Ubi, t he cre­ative di­rec­tor cuts a strik­ing fig­ure in a pur­ple suit and his sig­na­ture square-framed glasses – fit­ting for some­one of­ten called the god­fa­ther of Sin­ga­pore fash­ion.</p>
    <p>He had the idea in April, around the time the cir­cuit breaker was ex­tended. Since March, his team, Daniel Boey Cre­atives, had been work­ing on adapt­ing the an­nual Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts fash­ion show to a partly vir­tual event.</p>
    <p>When the cir­cuit breaker was ex­tended by a month, he saw the po­ten­tial to ex­pand it to a fes­ti­val for all to at­tend.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery other in­dus­try was com­ing to­gether – mu­sic, theatre, food. Rather than wait for things to hap­pen, we thought, let’s try and make things hap­pen on our own.”</p>
    <p>With no tech knowl­edge, he reached out to friends and con­tacts who could help with digi­tis­ing his grand ideas. An ac­quain­tance from dig­i­tal agency AP Me­dia an­swered his plea.</p>
    <p>The com­pany had prior ex­pe­ri­ence turn­ing the Sin­ga­pore Her­itage Fes­ti­val into an on­line event in June and knew ex­actly what he had in mind, says Boey.</p>
    <p>“It couldn’t be a 2D web­site – it had to be im­mer­sive, to recre­ate as much of the ex­cite­ment of a real fes­ti­val as pos­si­ble,” he says, adding that they took in­spi­ra­tion from the in­ter­ac­tiv­ity of role-play­ing video games.</p>
    <p>To sim­u­late mov­ing through rooms and “re­al­is­tic land­scapes”, the 360-de­gree fes­ti­val vil­lage has zones mod­elled after Sin­ga­pore’s cityscape.</p>
    <p>For i nstance, in the Run­way Room, a mod­ern re-cre­ation of the for­mer Na­tional Theatre which was de­mol­ished in 1986, visi­tors can watch run­way shows, while a ko­pi­tiam mod­elled on the now-closed her­itage con­fec­tionery Chin Mee Chin is a space f or ac­cess­ing pod­casts, panel dis­cus­sions and styling work­shops.</p>
    <p>All the events run on a sched­ule and after each day, they will be archived for easy re­view­ing, with the por­tal re­main­ing up for 12 months.</p>
    <p>You can shop too. It will be like a “vir­tual shop­ping fes­ti­val meets fash­ion fes­ti­val”, with links to the brands’ e-stores if you like what you see on the run­way, says Boey.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to try and help the de­sign­ers with their sales as well,” he adds.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tions are pre­sented as pre-filmed run­way shows, fash­ion videos and short films, which last from three to 10 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the fes­ti­val, de­sign­ers will ap­pear in a live stream after their shows to take ques­tions and talk about their col­lec­tions.</p>
    <p>Some shows – like those of home­grown de­sign­ers Max Tan and Gin Lee – were staged and filmed here.</p>
    <p>The two shows were shot in lo­cal art gal­leries.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers were re­motely pro­duced by the de­sign­ers abroad, such as Mel­bourne-based Sin­ga­porean de­signer Jude Ng, who filmed his docu-show in his show­room be­fore the cur­rent lock­down.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing had the “lux­ury of study­ing the suc­cess and fail­ures” of brands which went on­line early in the pan­demic, Boey be­lieves The Front Row will be more than just a “glossy TV com­mer­cial”.</p>
    <p>“Con­cep­tual but en­ter­tain­ing” ex­pe­ri­ences will hope­fully keep peo­ple hooked through­out the 10-day event, like in a com­puter game that keeps one en­gaged and ea­ger to get to new lev­els, Boey says.</p>
    <p>“We want peo­ple to stay on and watch other shows as well, to see what other sto­ries the de­sign­ers have to tell.”</p>
    <p>Fash­ion weeks of late, he adds, had be­come “a cir­cus”, with “peo­ple do­ing out­ra­geous things for shock value and for in­flu­encers to take pic­tures”.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to bring it back to the de­sign­ers and make them the fo­cus – and not just any de­signer, but those who would be rel­e­vant for the fu­ture of fash­ion.”</p>
    <p>And while the con­cept of of­fer­ing view­ers a front-row seat to the ac­tion may be a de­par­ture from fash­ion i ndus­try norms, where run­way shows are tra­di­tion­ally closed-door events, choos­ing not to evolve mind­sets would have been a “death knell”, says the vet­eran.</p>
    <p>“You re­ally have to keep up with the times. This whole thing about fash­ion be­ing ex­clu­sive – I think it’s some­thing fash­ion peo­ple cre­ated to make them­selves feel im­por­tant; and I say that as a ‘fash­ion per­son’.”</p>
    <p>With 2020 mark­ing his 30th year in the in­dus­try, he sees this as the best way to give back to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Many sup­port­ing in­dus­tries around fash­ion – mod­el­ling, hair and make-up, light­ing and set de­sign – have been suf­fer­ing, he notes.</p>
    <p>Funded by gov­ern­ment agency En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, the fes­ti­val has helped drive some in­come back to these play­ers and Boey hopes it will “pave the way to­wards the new nor­mal” of fash­ion events.</p>
    <p>Model Kaigin Yong, from Now Model Man­age­ment, was in­volved in six shows for The Front Row and paid for each show.</p>
    <p>While she had man­aged to book a few vir­tual photo shoots with mag­a­zines dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, she is thank­ful that “the in­dus­try’s sup­port for lo­cal mod­els has been stronger than ever”.</p>
    <p>“I feel like I’m start­ing out mod­el­ling all over again as there is so much to learn and adapt as fash­ion goes dig­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“With vir­tual shoots and vir­tual run­way shows be­com­ing more com­mon, mod­els need to be ac­tively in­volved in the cre­ative process, such as do­ing our own make-up and hair styling,” says the 25-year-old, who has been mod­el­ling for about three years.</p>
    <p>Fash­ion de­signer Gin Lee sees the fes­ti­val as an evo­lu­tion of the fash­ion week model, and in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>“In these un­usual times, ex­plor­ing new medi­ums is great, es­pe­cially to chal­lenge the sta­tus quo of the fash­ion in­dus­try. Typ­i­cal fash­ion shows tend to be highly un­af­ford­able for smaller de­signer la­bels,” she says.</p>
    <p>And if it all goes south, it will still have been a valiant ef­fort, “but touch wood”, Boey adds, fu­ri­ously palm­ing the wooden ta­ble in front of him.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, you can ei­ther choose to wal­low in self-pity or tackle the prob­lem,” he says.</p>
    <p>“At least we can say we tried.”</p>
    <p>With vir­tual shoots and vir­tual run­way shows be­com­ing more com­mon, mod­els need to be ac­tively in­volved in the cre­ative process, such as do­ing our own make-up and ’’ hair styling.
