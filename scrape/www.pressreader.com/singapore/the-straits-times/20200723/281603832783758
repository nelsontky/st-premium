    <p>Our cur­rent un­der­stand­ing of the im­pact of im­mi­gra­tion is not only im­per­fect, but also woe­fully in­ad­e­quate. More data and re­search on its im­pact in Sin­ga­pore will serve to en­lighten the pub­lic de­bate and al­low more ef­fec­tive im­mi­gra­tion poli­cies to be de­signed, says se­nior lec­turer Kelvin Seah Kah Cheng.</p>
    <p>Im­mi­gra­tion stood out as a hotly de­bated is­sue in the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion. This fo­cus is per­haps un­sur­pris­ing, given Sin­ga­pore’s size­able use of for­eign man­power.</p>
    <p>Last year, the num­ber of for­eign­ers – in­clud­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers – stood at</p>
    <p>1.4 mil­lion, mak­ing up 37.7 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal work­force. A read­ing of the com­ments made both on­line and off­line on the is­sue sug­gests that views on im­mi­gra­tion tend to be po­larised.</p>
    <p>‘GOOD’ AND ‘BAD’ DICHOTOMY</p>
    <p>Those who be­lieve im­mi­gra­tion is “good” of­ten ar­gue that it brings down costs and makes Sin­ga­pore more at­trac­tive to multi­na­tional com­pa­nies, which then leads to job cre­ation for lo­cals. Var­i­ous in­dus­try as­so­ci­a­tions, for in­stance, have tried to push forth the claim that, with re­duced im­mi­gra­tion, Sin­ga­pore­ans would be at the los­ing end and would have to pay higher prices. They also con­tend that re­stric­tions on for­eign man­power would make com­pa­nies less com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Those who be­lieve im­mi­gra­tion is “bad” of­ten ar­gue that Sin­ga­pore­ans would be harmed as im­mi­grants com­pete with them for jobs. They con­tend that Sin­ga­pore’s im­mi­gra­tion policy has been too lib­eral – and that quo­tas for work per­mit and S Pass hold­ers are too gen­er­ous (de­spite ef­forts by the Gov­ern­ment to re­duce them over the past decade) and there is no quota or levy im­posed on Em­ploy­ment Pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Im­mi­gra­tion draws strong opin­ions from peo­ple be­cause peo­ple be­lieve it will af­fect them.</p>
    <p>What is un­clear, though, is how they would be af­fected.</p>
    <p>The above claims sug­gest that it could go ei­ther way.</p>
    <p>Why is im­mi­gra­tion such a con­tentious is­sue? And how can we best ad­dress it go­ing for­ward?</p>
    <p>WHAT THE­ORY TELLS US</p>
    <p>In fact, economic the­ory pre­dicts that im­mi­gra­tion will not af­fect ev­ery na­tive worker in the same way: Some na­tive worker groups will gain while oth­ers will lose.</p>
    <p>Whether a na­tive worker ben­e­fits or loses from im­mi­gra­tion is likely to de­pend on his skill level and on the skill com­po­si­tion of the im­mi­grants. Tra­di­tional models of im­mi­gra­tion pre­dict that, gen­er­ally, low-skilled im­mi­gra­tion ben­e­fits high-skilled na­tives but hurts low-skilled ones. The logic is that while low-skilled im­mi­grants are likely com­ple­men­tary to high-skilled na­tives, they are likely to be sub­sti­tutes for low-skilled na­tives. The con­verse ap­plies for high-skilled im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Of course, con­clu­sions from the­ory are not de­fin­i­tive and may hinge on cer­tain as­sump­tions. So it is im­por­tant to study the im­pact of im­mi­gra­tion em­pir­i­cally, us­ing data.</p>
    <p>Ex­actly which na­tive groups gain and which groups lose? How large are the gains and losses? What hap­pens to na­tive em­ploy­ment and wages after all ad­just­ments in the econ­omy have oc­curred?</p>
    <p>But even this en­deav­our has not yielded con­clu­sive find­ings. To be sure, many em­pir­i­cal stud­ies done in­ter­na­tion­ally have found im­mi­gra­tion to have only small and in­signif­i­cant ef­fects on wages and em­ploy­ment of na­tive work­ers.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sors Rachel Fried­berg and Jen­nifer Hunt from Brown Univer­sity and Rut­gers Univer­sity re­spec­tively note this in their early study titled The Im­pact Of Im­mi­grants On Host Coun­try Wages, Em­ploy­ment And Growth, pub­lished in the Jour­nal of Economic Per­spec­tives in 1995.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this con­clu­sion has since been chal­lenged by the likes of re­cent work by Pro­fes­sor Chris­tian Dust­mann from Univer­sity Col­lege Lon­don and his col­leagues, pub­lished in the Quar­terly Jour­nal of Eco­nom­ics in 2017. Us­ing Ger­man data, Prof Dust­mann and his col­leagues show that a sharp and un­ex­pected in­flow of Czech work­ers to ar­eas along the</p>
    <p>Ger­man-Czech bor­der led to a sharp de­cline in lo­cal na­tive em­ploy­ment in Ger­man bor­der mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The lack of con­sen­sus from em­pir­i­cal stud­ies arises partly from the use of dif­fer­ent method­olo­gies. An­other fac­tor is that stud­ies have used data from dif­fer­ent coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of im­mi­gra­tion is likely to be coun­try-spe­cific, which means that it is dif­fi­cult to gen­er­alise the re­sults found in other coun­tries to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Em­pir­i­cally, what do we know about the labour mar­ket im­pact of im­mi­gra­tion in Sin­ga­pore? Not much. One rea­son for this is the lack of high-qual­ity peer-re­viewed Sin­ga­pore-based em­pir­i­cal re­search ad­dress­ing this, ow­ing pos­si­bly to the lack of pub­licly avail­able data.</p>
    <p>SIM­PLE AS­SO­CI­A­TIONS NOT ENOUGH</p>
    <p>It is worth not­ing that sim­ple as­so­ci­a­tions be­tween im­mi­gra­tion and labour mar­ket out­comes should not be taken as con­vinc­ing ev­i­dence of such im­pacts.</p>
    <p>In­deed, pro­po­nents of im­mi­gra­tion have of­ten tried to ar­gue that im­mi­gra­tion has been ben­e­fi­cial, by point­ing to sta­tis­tics which show a pos­i­tive re­la­tion­ship be­tween the in­comes and em­ploy­ment of na­tives and im­mi­gra­tion over time.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, op­po­nents have tried to ar­gue that im­mi­gra­tion has led to a stag­na­tion in the wages of na­tives be­long­ing to cer­tain oc­cu­pa­tions, by point­ing to sta­tis­tics which show a neg­a­tive re­la­tion­ship be­tween im­mi­gra­tion and the wages of na­tives in th­ese oc­cu­pa­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, th­ese sim­ple as­so­ci­a­tions, by them­selves, do not con­sti­tute con­vinc­ing ev­i­dence of cause and effect since they may be spu­ri­ously driven by other fac­tors such as macroe­co­nomic con­di­tions, in­de­pen­dent of im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>To es­tab­lish causal­ity, we need to know “what would have been?”.</p>
    <p>Would na­tive em­ploy­ment and wages have been higher if there were less mi­gra­tion? If so, this would be in­dica­tive that na­tives were hurt by im­mi­gra­tion. The con­verse would be true if na­tive em­ploy­ment and wages would have been lower with less im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Es­ti­mat­ing causal ef­fects re­quires more elab­o­rate sta­tis­ti­cal meth­ods, which go be­yond sim­ple as­so­ci­a­tions.</p>
    <p>What makes im­mi­gra­tion so con­tentious is just how lit­tle we know about it. This leaves a lot of room for spec­u­la­tion and for dif­fer­ent groups to make dif­fer­ent claims about its ef­fects, some­times based on vested in­ter­ests. It also cre­ates a lot of un­cer­tainty and in­se­cu­rity in peo­ple, who are un­sure if im­mi­gra­tion will ben­e­fit them.</p>
    <p>MORE DATA AND RE­SEARCH NEEDED</p>
    <p>Im­mi­gra­tion brings about both costs and ben­e­fits. It trig­gers many com­plex changes in the econ­omy – not just the labour mar­ket, but also other mar­kets such as hous­ing and prod­uct. Some of th­ese changes oc­cur im­me­di­ately; oth­ers take time to oc­cur. A com­pre­hen­sive as­sess­ment would need to con­sider all th­ese ef­fects and to as­sess how dif­fer­ent groups in so­ci­ety are im­pacted by im­mi­gra­tion – both in the short and in the long run. This re­quires that we know the mag­ni­tude of the costs and ben­e­fits as­so­ci­ated with im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Yet, our cur­rent un­der­stand­ing of the im­pact of im­mi­gra­tion is not only im­per­fect, but also woe­fully in­ad­e­quate. This is trou­bling be­cause a lack of em­pir­i­cal data and ab­sence of un­der­stand­ing about th­ese is­sues pre­vent us from know­ing ex­actly what the trade-offs as­so­ci­ated with im­mi­gra­tion are and to im­prove upon pub­lic de­ci­sion-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>It also risks us run­ning into a sit­u­a­tion where de­ci­sions are made in the in­ter­ests of lobbying groups rather than in the col­lec­tive in­ter­est of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>More data and re­search on the im­pact of im­mi­gra­tion in Sin­ga­pore will serve to en­lighten the pub­lic de­bate and al­low more ef­fec­tive im­mi­gra­tion poli­cies to be de­signed.</p>
