    <p>When Robert De Niro’s 70-year-old char­ac­ter takes up an in­tern­ship at an e-com­merce fash­ion start-up in the movie The In­tern (2015), he starts off need­ing help with tech­nol­ogy and not hav­ing much to do.</p>
    <p>But he finds ways to learn and help, and even­tu­ally be­comes an in­valu­able mem­ber of the team.</p>
    <p>Like in reel life, some ma­ture in­terns here have also re­ceived good re­views from their host or­gan­i­sa­tions, rang­ing from start-ups to statu­tory boards.</p>
    <p>Ms Man­isha See­wal, group chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer of au­to­mo­tive mar­ket­place Carro, hosted a 50-year-old dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing in­tern for two months this year.</p>
    <p>“We were very im­pressed with her... demon­strat­ing the growth mind­set that’s needed to suc­ceed in to­day’s job mar­ket. The younger in­terns too looked up to her as a role model for learn­ing con­stantly,” she said.</p>
    <p>The in­tern, who was new to dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing, landed a full-time role in a dif­fer­ent in­dus­try and also signed up for a one-year dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing course at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic, she added.</p>
    <p>Mr Guil­laume Catella, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of ven­ture builder start-up Creatella, is cur­rently host­ing a sec­ond ma­ture in­tern from Sin­ga­pore, Ms Joyce Toh, 44 (see story be­low).</p>
    <p>The firm typ­i­cally hosts up to 10 in­terns a year in­ter­na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>Mr Catella said the first ma­ture in­tern three years back, whose back­ground was in lit­er­a­ture, quickly went from in­tern to dig­i­tal mar­keter, project man­age­ment as­sis­tant and project man­ager, be­fore launch­ing a start-up her­self.</p>
    <p>“Ma­ture in­terns never fail to sur­prise us pos­i­tively. We too learn from their past ex­pe­ri­ence and per­spec­tives,” he said. “Our team’s val­ues and work method­ol­ogy tend to at­tract more younger peo­ple, but as long as some­one feels strongly aligned with our vi­sion and val­ues, his age is ir­rel­e­vant,” he added.</p>
    <p>In­stead of hav­ing a fixed in­tern­ship pro­gramme, Mr Catella said the firm takes the time to un­der­stand its in­terns’ strengths, what they want to learn most, their ca­reer goals and skill sets they need to de­velop, and then cre­ate roles, road maps and a struc­ture that fits them.</p>
    <p>Mid-ca­reer job seek­ers can con­sider com­pany at­tach­ments un­der the SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways pro­gramme. As at the end of last month, there were about 10,600 such op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Even though it is not a per­ma­nent role, Work­force Sin­ga­pore prin­ci­pal ca­reer coach Glen­ford Koh said tak­ing on a com­pany at­tach­ment or com­pany-based train­ing un­der the pro­gramme shows prospec­tive em­ploy­ers that a job seeker is adapt­able and proac­tive in con­tin­u­ing to be pro­duc­tive and en­gaged in the work­force – at­tributes which most em­ploy­ers look for in a can­di­date.</p>
    <p>On how ma­ture work­ers can make the most of an in­tern­ship, Mr Paul Heng, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of NeXT Ca­reer Con­sult­ing Group, Asia, rec­om­mended start­ing with a mind­set that tak­ing on a ma­ture in­tern­ship is not a step back­wards, but the be­gin­ning of a new chap­ter in one’s ca­reer. Em­ploy­ers or su­per­vi­sors must also want to make it work. Both in­terns and bosses need to be re­al­is­tic and be pre­pared to set rea­son­able key per­for­mance in­di­ca­tors, he said.</p>
    <p>Also key is sup­port from one’s spouse or fam­ily, he added. They must un­der­stand the re­al­ity of the sit­u­a­tion and be aware of why their fam­ily mem­ber wants or needs to take on an in­tern­ship. “Moral and prac­ti­cal sup­port can make a dif­fer­ence be­tween suc­cess and fail­ure,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh noted that if the com­pany does not broach the sub­ject of an em­ploy­ment con­tract three months be­fore the at­tach­ment is due to end, the mid-ca­reer job seeker should take the ini­tia­tive to speak with the im­me­di­ate su­per­vi­sor to de­ter­mine whether he has a fu­ture with the com­pany.</p>
    <p>“Take the chance to thank them for the op­por­tu­nity to learn new skills and gain ex­pe­ri­ence in the past few months too,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If the com­pany val­ues the job seek­ers, it will make an of­fer that ap­peals to them.</p>
    <p>“A pro­gres­sive em­ployer will also value the ma­tu­rity, past work­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and trans­fer­able skills of mid-ca­reer job seek­ers and be will­ing to of­fer higher pay than it would to fresh grad­u­ates.”</p>
