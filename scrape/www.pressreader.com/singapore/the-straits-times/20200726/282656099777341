    <p>The is­sue of how gov­ern­ments should lead their so­ci­eties into a post-Covid-19 world oc­cu­pies many minds these days, as the global pan­demic shows no sign of abat­ing, six months af­ter the virus in­fected peo­ple in China be­fore spread­ing rapidly around the world.</p>
    <p>So it is with Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Two weeks af­ter an event­ful gen­eral elec­tion that saw a record 10 seats go to the op­po­si­tion Work­ers’ Party, the coun­try is mov­ing on rapidly.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans, too, are get­ting on with liv­ing with Covid-19, with many work­ing from home and ob­serv­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules. The min­is­te­rial task force has re­sumed its reg­u­lar me­dia con­fer­ences and up­dates. Anx­i­eties over health, jobs and wages re­main top of mind for many.</p>
    <p>As many ob­servers have pointed out, coun­tries with trusted, ef­fec­tive gov­ern­ment sys­tems and co­he­sive com­mu­ni­ties with a stronger sense of sol­i­dar­ity ap­pear to do bet­ter cop­ing with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In such so­ci­eties, po­lit­i­cal lead­ers adopt sci­en­tific ex­perts’ ad­vice and trans­late it into clear dos and don’ts that cit­i­zens will­ingly abide by. In­di­vid­u­als com­ply with so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules and wear­ing of masks in pub­lic, in the be­lief that such per­sonal acts of in­con­ve­nience are for the pub­lic good.</p>
    <p>In so­ci­eties with frag­mented in­sti­tu­tions pulling in dif­fer­ent directions and po­larised pol­i­tics, such as Amer­ica un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, there is a lack of co­or­di­na­tion.</p>
    <p>May­ors counter state gov­er­nors’ de­ci­sions; the fed­eral gov­ern­ment’s dic­tates are over­rid­den by in­di­vid­ual states; and nu­mer­ous law­suits are launched by pub­lic of­fi­cials against other of­fices, to over­turn mask-wear­ing rules or to pre­vent busi­ness-friendly ad­min­is­tra­tions from open­ing schools and work­places. The re­sult is con­fu­sion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, peo­ple go about their lives, sans mask, sans so­cial dis­tanc­ing, and the virus spreads, cross­ing four mil­lion in­fec­tions last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>It is be­com­ing clear that man­ag­ing a pub­lic health cri­sis re­quires a well-func­tion­ing state, one able to har­ness re­sources across the com­plex pub­lic ad­min­is­tra­tion ma­chin­ery, and able to tap pri­vate and com­mu­nity re­sources and weave them to­gether into a co­her­ent strat­egy.</p>
    <p>The role of the state in a post-pan­demic world was the sub­ject of a stim­u­lat­ing webinar dis­cus­sion last Wed­nes­day evening, or­gan­ised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy (LKYSPP).</p>
    <p>Ti­tled “Af­ter the pan­demic – the re­birth of big gov­ern­ment? State ca­pac­ity, trust and pri­vacy in the post-Covid-19 era”, it fea­tured Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies; Bloomberg edi­tor-in-chief John Mick­leth­wait and Fi­nan­cial Times (FT) global busi­ness colum­nist Rana Foroohar.</p>
    <p>LKYSPP as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of prac­tice James Crab­tree, a for­mer FT jour­nal­ist, was the moder­a­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man said the post-Covid-19 world needed not a big gov­ern­ment, but an ac­tivist one that fo­cused on do­ing the right things.</p>
    <p>This ac­tivist gov­ern­ment can mar­shal pub­lic re­sources of the state, and the pri­vate fi­nance and en­tre­pre­neur­ial spirit of the mar­ket, to co-cre­ate so­lu­tions that make for a more pro­gres­sive, fairer so­ci­ety, he said.</p>
    <p>“We’re not go­ing back to large states per se, but we do have to go back to... a sense of mo­ral pur­pose in gov­ern­ment, hav­ing the con­fi­dence to con­vince the pop­u­la­tion that these are the right things to do – and we’re all go­ing to have to or­gan­ise our­selves to­gether to achieve it – and an abil­ity to fo­cus the re­sources of the state on what mat­ters most, rather than every­thing.</p>
    <p>“You don’t nec­es­sar­ily have to be very large, but you have to be very good at the most im­por­tant things you should be do­ing, and go about it with the spirit of an ac­tivist.”</p>
    <p>This re­quires gov­ern­ments to re­cen­tre gov­ern­ment and fis­cal pol­icy on the pro­vi­sion of key pub­lic goods such as health­care and ed­u­ca­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>“So if you fo­cus on pub­lic goods and try and do it well, and you try and lev­er­age the en­er­gies of the pri­vate sec­tor and com­mu­ni­ties, you have an ef­fec­tive state.”</p>
    <p>In talk­ing about a re­order­ing of the state, mar­ket and com­mu­nity, Mr Thar­man said the post-Covid-19 world needs a new so­cial com­pact that re­quires a cul­ture of col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity to achieve.</p>
    <p>While Mr Thar­man spoke about gov­ern­ments in gen­eral, his point is es­pe­cially per­ti­nent for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>CUL­TURE OF COL­LEC­TIVE RE­SPON­SI­BIL­ITY</p>
    <p>To have a cul­ture of col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity that sup­ports good pol­i­cy­mak­ing, Sin­ga­pore needs to get its pol­i­tics right, to adopt a term some­times used by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>Get­ting pol­i­tics right is be­com­ing more im­por­tant these days, as de­bate over is­sues be­comes more po­lar­is­ing. In the af­ter­math of an elec­tion, it re­quires peo­ple to build bridges and come to­gether across po­lit­i­cal di­vides.</p>
    <p>The West­min­ster par­lia­men­tary sys­tem, which Sin­ga­pore’s Par­lia­ment is based on, is ad­ver­sar­ial by na­ture, with par­ties de­signed to check and op­pose each other.</p>
    <p>But for Sin­ga­pore to sur­vive and thrive in a post-Covid-19 world, we will have to quickly evolve our own prac­tice of po­lit­i­cal co­op­er­a­tion and bi­par­ti­san­ship.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is sim­ply too small for its denizens to fight among them­selves. As it is, each elec­tion bat­tle leaves some vot­ers feel­ing bruised. Our pub­lic agora on­line al­ready shows signs of be­com­ing po­larised.</p>
    <p>We must re­verse any ten­den­cies to­wards par­ti­san fight­ing, whether among politi­cians or their sup­port­ers, and seek to come to­gether as a na­tion to fo­cus on how to im­prove our so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>This re­quires the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) to give up its pol­i­tics of dom­i­nance and adopt the pol­i­tics of na­tional unity.</p>
    <p>A vivid ex­am­ple of what this means was when PM Lee said at the early-morn­ing post-polls me­dia con­fer­ence that Work­ers’ Party (WP) chief Pri­tam Singh would be given the of­fi­cial role and ti­tle of Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, with sup­port and re­sources to help him carry out his role ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>Con­trast this with past elec­tions, when PAP lead­ers be­moaned their party’s loss of sup­port and threat­ened to with­hold gov­ern­ment-funded es­tate up­grad­ing projects from op­po­si­tion-held con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>Such moves helped prop up the PAP vote share through the 1990s and 2000s. It was good party pol­i­tics, but bad for na­tional unity.</p>
    <p>Striv­ing for na­tional unity re­quires the PAP gov­ern­ment to ac­cept al­ter­na­tive par­ties in Par­lia­ment and work with them for the good of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>For­mal­is­ing a Leader of the Op­po­si­tion role was a very good first step. Op­er­a­tional­is­ing it well is cru­cial. Sin­ga­pore­ans will be watch­ing to see how Mr Singh and the WP will be treated in Par­lia­ment, by the civil ser­vice, and as they carry out con­stituency and town coun­cil du­ties.</p>
    <p>Will in­cum­bent of­fi­cials and es­tab­lish­ment in­sti­tu­tions treat them with re­spect and co­op­er­a­tion, or will there be at­tempts to hin­der or block their ef­forts?</p>
    <p>AN OP­PO­SI­TION THAT PRO­MOTES UNITY</p>
    <p>Like­wise, many are also wait­ing to see how Mr Singh and his party con­duct them­selves and go abut their roles as loyal op­po­si­tion, al­ways putting Sin­ga­pore’s in­ter­ests first, ahead of par­ti­san point scor­ing.</p>
    <p>Build­ing na­tional unity re­quires no less ef­fort from other po­lit­i­cal play­ers.</p>
    <p>The WP has to live up to be­ing for­mally recog­nised as the al­ter­na­tive party in Par­lia­ment. To do so, it must put Sin­ga­pore first, not the party. It also needs to ad­dress its role in Par­lia­ment se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>As PM Lee said of the WP, ac­knowl­edg­ing vot­ers’ de­sire for op­po­si­tion voices: “I look for­ward to them par­tic­i­pat­ing in and con­tribut­ing to the de­bate in Par­lia­ment, and to the na­tional de­bate, as we deal with the ur­gent is­sues be­fore us.”</p>
    <p>Mr Singh has pledged the WP will be loyal to Sin­ga­pore, and play a con­struc­tive role as op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Its aim is not to “nee­dle the PAP” but to seek good out­comes for Sin­ga­pore. It can do so by mak­ing sure peo­ple’s voices are front and cen­tre in Par­lia­ment, and also act­ing as a check on the Gov­ern­ment, he has said.</p>
    <p>The WP will thus be ex­pected to go be­yond crit­i­cis­ing, to scru­ti­n­is­ing gov­ern­ment poli­cies and of­fer­ing vi­able al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>The WP, and the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party, which has two Non-Con­stituency MP seats, must raise their game fast. Their MPs have to think like pol­i­cy­mak­ers, not just politi­cians.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, ask­ing for more sub­si­dies is al­ways easy and pop­u­lar; but sup­port­ing lim­its to sub­si­dies to main­tain fis­cal sus­tain­abil­ity may be the more prin­ci­pled course of ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore vot­ers are nei­ther spendthrif­ts nor stupid; they will see through a party that seeks to win sup­port by spend­ing sav­ings from re­serves set aside for their grand­chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, eco­nomics pro­fes­sor and Sengkang GRC MP Ja­mus Lim is hav­ing to ex­plain and jus­tify the WP’s pro­posal for a min­i­mum wage, when the econ­omy is in a re­ces­sion and em­ploy­ers are go­ing bank­rupt; and the sus­tain­abil­ity of its sug­gested low-pre­mium na­tional re­dun­dancy scheme at a time when job losses are ex­pected to mount.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers hold­ing al­ter­na­tive par­ties to ac­count will force them to sharpen their pol­icy pro­pos­als and is a wel­come de­vel­op­ment for our democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment is the right fo­rum to thrash out the pros and cons of ri­val ap­proaches to eco­nomic and so­cial poli­cies, so that the right leg­is­la­tion is put in place for post-Covid-19 Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>CIT­I­ZENS AND RE­SPON­SI­BIL­ITY</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, vot­ers and cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>What does a cul­ture of col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity mean for all of us, who are not in the di­rect po­lit­i­cal arena, but whose words and ac­tions help shape the na­tion’s po­lit­i­cal process and poli­cies?</p>
    <p>Just as we re­quire po­lit­i­cal play­ers to act in prin­ci­pled, fair ways, we too must be­have like­wise.</p>
    <p>Dis­cuss pub­lic is­sues fairly and ra­tio­nally, with­out name-call­ing or launch­ing per­sonal at­tacks on those with dif­fer­ent po­lit­i­cal views.</p>
    <p>Our on­line po­lit­i­cal dis­cus­sion sphere is veer­ing on neg­a­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Each of us can re­solve not to feed the beasts of ig­no­rance and anger on so­cial me­dia by shar­ing toxic posts.</p>
    <p>Im­por­tantly, speak out against bad be­hav­iour and lend your sup­port to those do­ing so.</p>
    <p>Whether in pri­vate chat groups, in per­son, or on pub­lic so­cial me­dia, by­standers play an im­por­tant role in shap­ing the tone of dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>Call­ing out bul­lies and trolls, speak­ing up for mi­nori­ties be­ing ha­rassed, and gen­er­ally tak­ing a stand against bad be­hav­iour, can re­duce such neg­a­tive acts.</p>
    <p>If ev­ery bul­ly­ing com­ment or per­sonal at­tack is met with a cho­rus of po­lite but firm dis­ap­proval from by­standers, chances of that bully stop­ping, or bet­ter still, re­form­ing his be­hav­iour, is high.</p>
    <p>In the months ahead, as the Gov­ern­ment moves full swing into its post-elec­tion agenda of get­ting through Covid-19, there will be many dif­fi­cult de­ci­sions to make and hard times to get through.</p>
    <p>Many busi­nesses will fail, and peo­ple will lose their jobs. Fam­i­lies will be un­der stress. Health­care re­sources will con­tinue to be stretched. At some point, state sup­port for ail­ing com­pa­nies and work­ers will have to ta­per off.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, there is ur­gency to re­model Sin­ga­pore to cope bet­ter with Covid-19 and pre­pare for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, the pan­demic has ex­posed our frail­ties as a so­ci­ety – most no­tably, the way vul­ner­a­ble mi­grant work­ers, the el­derly and low-in­come fam­i­lies are worst hit by health and in­come losses.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has un­der­lined our geopo­lit­i­cal vul­ner­a­bil­ity as shift­ing sup­ply chains and grow­ing na­tion­al­ism threaten to ma­roon Sin­ga­pore’s re­source-scarce, tiny, is­land city state in a sea of pro­tec­tion­ism.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, we have a new team of po­lit­i­cal lead­ers in place who will find it in­creas­ingly harder to win over a younger gen­er­a­tion more ex­cited by the prom­ise of po­lit­i­cal ex­per­i­men­ta­tion than per­suaded that the story of Sin­ga­pore’s vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties is not fic­tion but an ex­is­ten­tial fact.</p>
    <p>The months and years ahead are go­ing to be tough. Dif­fi­cult de­ci­sions and trade-offs have to be made on how to re­shape Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Be­fore we em­bark on ac­tivist pol­i­cy­mak­ing, we need ev­ery­one on board, re­gard­less of po­lit­i­cal af­fil­i­a­tion, pulling in the same di­rec­tion.</p>
