    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia said it is close to reach­ing a deal to pro­duce a Covid-19 vac­cine, as the coun­try strug­gles to con­tain spi­ralling in­fec­tions in Vic­to­ria, a state that has seen re­newed lock­down mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Greg Hunt said yes­ter­day that the Aus­tralian govern­ment is in ad­vanced ne­go­ti­a­tions with dif­fer­ent com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Mr Hunt told Sky News and The Sunday Tele­graph that he was gen­uinely op­ti­mistic that a vac­cine would be in­ter­na­tion­ally avail­able by next year.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral govern­ment is in the fi­nal stages of ne­go­ti­a­tions with a ma­jor vac­cine man­u­fac­turer, be­lieved to be Bri­tish drug maker As­traZeneca, to pro­duce doses of the vac­cine in Aus­tralia, The Sunday Tele­graph re­ported.</p>
    <p>A fi­nal pro­posal is ex­pected to go be­fore the Ex­pen­di­ture Re­view Com­mit­tee within days, and sources are con­fi­dent that a con­tract will be signed within a fort­night, The Sunday Tele­graph said.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment wants to use lo­cal fa­cil­i­ties to pro­duce the vac­cine, with as many as 30 po­ten­tial sites be­ing re­viewed, ac­cord­ing to the news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia would join Mex­ico and Ar­gentina in reach­ing an agree­ment to pro­duce the treat­ment be­ing de­vel­oped by As­traZeneca and the Uni­ver­sity of Ox­ford. The vac­cine is among the lead­ers in the race to de­velop an im­mu­ni­sa­tion against Covid-19 that has killed more than 768,000 peo­ple world­wide.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Pas­cal So­riot is a pend­ing board mem­ber of Aus­tralia’s big­gest health com­pany CSL.</p>
    <p>Mr Hunt told Sky News that Aus­tralia was mak­ing sig­nif­i­cant progress in ne­go­ti­at­ing ac­cess to var­i­ous po­ten­tial vac­cines and would ide­ally man­u­fac­ture any can­di­date on­shore through CSL.</p>
