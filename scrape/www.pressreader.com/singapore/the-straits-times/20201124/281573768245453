    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy may ex­pand by 4 per cent to 6 per cent next year, the fastest pace in a decade, helped by a low base, the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try said yes­ter­day. How­ever, gross do­mes­tic prod­uct will prob­a­bly not re­turn to pre-coro­n­avirus lev­els un­til the end of next year, it said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy has turned a corner and will re­bound next year, though the re­cov­ery is ex­pected to be grad­ual.</p>
    <p>It is still poised to grow by the fastest pace in a decade, helped by a low base, the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In its maiden fore­cast for next year, MTI said the econ­omy may ex­pand by 4 per cent to 6 per cent – the most since 2011, when it grew by 6.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) will prob­a­bly not re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els un­til the end of next year, it said while pre­sent­ing the Eco­nomic Sur­vey of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said that while the growth out­look may have i mproved, there was still much work to be done. “While we are turn­ing the corner, we still have a long way to go in our eco­nomic re­cov­ery,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some of the gloom brought on by the pan­demic is be­ing dis­pelled. There were signs that the con­tin­ued ex­pan­sion of trade and man­u­fac­tur­ing, and a grad­ual re­cov­ery in con­struc­tio­nand tourism-re­lated sec­tors, would spur the re­bound.</p>
    <p>For this year, the econ­omy will con­tract by 6.5 per cent to 6 per cent – less than the pre­vi­ous es­ti­mate of a 7 per cent to 5 per cent shrink­age.</p>
    <p>The full-year es­ti­mate was nar­rowed af­ter the econ­omy did bet­ter in the third quar­ter than ex­pected. It ex­panded by 9.2 per cent on a quar­ter-on-quar­ter sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis in the July-Septem­ber pe­riod, a turn­around from the 13.2 per cent de­cline in the sec­ond quar­ter, the Eco­nomic Sur­vey showed.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to sup­port busi­nesses and work­ers to pivot and adapt to the new re­al­i­ties of a Covid-19-stricken world, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>“If we are able to help our busi­nesses and work­ers make the nec­es­sary ad­just­ments and pivot quickly, I have ev­ery rea­son to be­lieve that we will emerge in a stronger po­si­tion than be­fore,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gabriel Lim, Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary for Trade and In­dus­try, said the im­proved show­ing in the third quar­ter came as ac­tiv­i­ties re­sumed af­ter the cir­cuit breaker ended on June 1. “While growth is ex­pected to re­bound from the low base this year, our eco­nomic re­cov­ery is ex­pected to be grad­ual, with GDP not likely to re­turn to pre-Covid lev­els un­til the end of 2021,” he noted.</p>
    <p>“Fur­ther­more, there re­mains un­cer­tainty over how the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion will evolve glob­ally in the year ahead, which will de­pend in part on the progress in vac­cine de­vel­op­ment, pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion.”</p>
    <p>The fore­cast of a re­turn to pos­i­tive growth next year is based on an im­proved out­look for trade-re­lated ser­vices, while the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor con­tin­ues to march on, boosted by ro­bust elec­tron­ics and semi­con­duc­tor de­mand.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion- and tourism-re­lated sec­tors are pro­jected to see a grad­ual re­cov­ery in vis­i­tor ar­rivals, which in turn will ben­e­fit con­sumer-fac­ing re­tail and food ser­vice sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Still, eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity in these sec­tors is not likely to re­turn to preCovid-19 lev­els, even by end-2021.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion may re­cover, al­though safe man­age­ment mea­sures will keep the sec­tor sub­dued.</p>
    <p>Mr Kenny Tan, a di­rec­tor at the Min­istry of Man­power, said em­ploy­ers are likely to take a cau­tious view to­wards fresh hir­ing.</p>
    <p>Thus, un­em­ploy­ment will likely re­main at el­e­vated lev­els, even as GDP growth re­bounds, he added.</p>

    <p>As Sin­ga­pore em­barks on its long road to re­cov­ery, busi­nesses and work­ers must adapt to the new re­al­i­ties of the Covid-19 world, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The im­prove­ment in Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy in the third quar­ter of this year shows that the Repub­lic is on the right path, he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy, while show­ing a con­trac­tion, beat es­ti­mates as it shrank by 5.8 per cent year on year in the third quar­ter – an im­prove­ment from the 13.3 per cent de­cline seen in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter that was Sin­ga­pore’s worst quar­terly per­for­mance on record.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a me­dia briefing, Mr Chan said it is only a mat­ter of time be­fore Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy re­turns to pre-Covid-19 lev­els in terms of eco­nomic num­bers.</p>
    <p>But the qual­i­ta­tive as­pect of the Repub­lic’s re­cov­ery – or how it re­cov­ers – is more im­por­tant, given how the econ­omy would have changed per­ma­nently, he said. Sup­ply chain pat­terns and the surge in dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ments would be dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic mea­sures must keep pace with the de­mands of the mar­ket, which is why it is im­per­a­tive to help busi­nesses and work­ers move to­wards new growth ar­eas, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment’s sup­port mea­sures to­wards busi­nesses and work­ers will also pivot, he added, not­ing that it is not pos­si­ble for the Gov­ern­ment to in­def­i­nitely sup­port busi­ness mod­els that are no longer rel­e­vant and com­pet­i­tive in a Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing for­ward, our sup­port must be more tar­geted and fo­cus on pos­i­tive out­comes for our busi­nesses and work­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties will help busi­nesses strengthen ex­ist­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties and build new ones, ex­pand into new over­seas mar­kets, as well as dig­i­talise and ac­cess new op­por­tu­ni­ties through on­line plat­forms, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>He out­lined four fac­tors that will im­pact the pace of eco­nomic re­cov­ery do­mes­ti­cally and glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Two of the fac­tors are within Sin­ga­pore’s con­trol: The coun­try’s coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion rates and the abil­ity of its busi­nesses and work­ers to pivot and adapt to the Covid-19 world, he noted.</p>
    <p>“If we are able to con­tinue to keep our in­fec­tion rates low, we will be able to re­sume more ac­tiv­i­ties and in­crease our in­ter­ac­tions with the rest of the world. This will re­quire the con­tin­ued co­op­er­a­tion of our people to ad­here to the pre­vail­ing mea­sures,” Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>But global de­vel­op­ments – the geopo­lit­i­cal dy­nam­ics be­tween big coun­tries such as the United States and China, and the re­cur­ring waves of in­fec­tion glob­ally – are out­side Sin­ga­pore’s con­trol, he said.</p>
    <p>“We do not yet know how the new US ad­min­is­tra­tion will ap­proach its re­la­tions with China. But we hope both sides will dial down ten­sions and re­turn to a more open and in­clu­sive global eco­nomic or­der,” Mr Chan said, adding that the path for­ward lies in greater in­ter­de­pen­dence, and not in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, re­cur­ring waves of in­fec­tion abroad, lead­ing to new lock­downs, will also have a knock-on ef­fect on global de­mand, which will af­fect ex­port-ori­ented economies like Sin­ga­pore, he said.</p>
    <p>“So long as we man­age the con­trol­lable fac­tors well, and mit­i­gate the risks of those be­yond our con­trol, I be­lieve we can re­cover more quickly,” Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore now has the test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties and health­care ca­pac­ity to man­age risks from im­ported cases. This will en­sure they do not in­fect the lo­cal com­mu­nity, which will al­low the Repub­lic to fur­ther open its bor­ders.</p>
    <p>This would al­low more Sin­ga­pore-based res­i­dents and work­ers to travel over­seas for work, and for the nec­es­sary pro­fes­sion­als and work­ers who drive the na­tion’s econ­omy and sup­port its so­cial ser­vices to come in, he added.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Sin­ga­pore will also be able to pro­gres­sively host more sig­nif­i­cant meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) events to main­tain its po­si­tion as a lead­ing busi­ness node, Mr Chan said, adding that he will share more on this at the Trav­elRe­vive trade show to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of im­ported cases may rise, but the risk to the lo­cal com­mu­nity will be mit­i­gated,” said the min­is­ter.</p>
