    <p>To help the econ­omy re­cover from the se­vere blows of Covid-19, Sin­ga­pore will keep in­vest­ing in tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion to safe­guard its com­pet­i­tive edge glob­ally and cre­ate op­por­tu­ni­ties for work­ers and busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat made the point yes­ter­day when he stressed the con­tin­u­ing im­por­tance of sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy (S&T) as an en­gine of growth.</p>
    <p>Re­search, in­no­va­tion and en­ter­prise in Sin­ga­pore will help trans­form the econ­omy to cre­ate more jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, he added in the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion’s (NRF) Ad­den­dum to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress. Mr Heng chairs the foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“We will scale up i nno­va­tion plat­forms to drive S&T adop­tion across in­dus­try, and en­hance the trans­la­tion of re­search out­comes into glob­ally com­pet­i­tive and mar­ketable S&T so­lu­tions that will de­rive greater value for Sin­ga­pore and the world,” he said.</p>
    <p>S&T ef­forts have been crit­i­cal in turn­ing the tide against Covid-19 here, he noted, adding that there are more than 200 re­search projects un­der way to bol­ster the coun­try’s bat­tle against the coro­n­avirus and pre­pare it for fu­ture pan­demics.</p>
    <p>Even in a post-Covid-19 world, these re­search ef­forts will be cru­cial in help­ing to cre­ate new op­por­tu­ni­ties for eco­nomic growth. The NRF will con­tinue to de­velop S&T ar­eas in which Sin­ga­pore is strong, Mr Heng said, cit­ing ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing and en­gi­neer­ing, health and bio­med­i­cal sciences, sus­tain­abil­ity and ur­ban so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>New ar­eas where S&T can help firms grow will not be ig­nored, he added, not­ing that the NRF ini­ti­ated the Mar­itime Trans­for­ma­tion and Avi­a­tion Trans­for­ma­tion pro­grammes to ad­vance Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion as a mar­itime and avi­a­tion hub. Ef­forts such as these lever­age cut­ting-edge tech­nolo­gies that will al­low Sin­ga­pore to re­main a crit­i­cal trans­port and lo­gis­tics node whose re­silience and re­li­a­bil­ity will be more valued when the Covid-19 scourge is over­come, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>The NRF’s agenda also in­cludes plans to keep on build­ing a base of ca­pa­ble sci­en­tists and en­gi­neers in Sin­ga­pore, with strong links to global com­mu­ni­ties, plus en­cour­ag­ing more young Sin­ga­pore­ans to pur­sue ca­reers built around S&T to spur more in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>SUP­PORT­ING IN­NO­VA­TION WITH TOP IN­FRA­STRUC­TURE</p>
    <p>In the same vein, Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran, said Sin­ga­pore’s in­no­va­tion ef­forts will be pow­ered by its in­vest­ments in world-class in­fra­struc­ture as well as re­search and de­vel­op­ment (R&D).</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s high de­gree of con­nec­tiv­ity, lauded as one of its strengths in­ter­na­tion­ally, will be fur­ther im­proved with the de­vel­op­ment of 5G in the coun­try, said Mr Iswaran, whose min­istry also re­leased its Ad­den­dum yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We are build­ing a se­cure and re­silient 5G com­mu­ni­ca­tions net­work, which will pro­vide the foun­da­tion for in­no­va­tive ap­pli­ca­tions and ser­vices. We will grow in­dige­nous ca­pa­bil­i­ties in tech­nolo­gies that drive value cre­ation.”</p>
    <p>His min­istry also plans to col­lab­o­rate with academia and in­dus­try part­ners to deepen Sin­ga­pore’s R&D and trans­la­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties, par­tic­u­larly in fields like ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, cy­ber se­cu­rity, me­dia and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ment in tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tion is al­ready bear­ing fruit, as Sin­ga­pore is widely re­garded as one of the top fin­tech hubs in the world.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam said yes­ter­day that an es­ti­mated 1,000 fin­tech firms are now based here, fol­low­ing five years of in­vest­ment in dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion and in­no­va­tion of the fi­nan­cial sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Thar­man, who is the Min­is­terin-charge of the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS), said in its Ad­den­dum yes­ter­day that it will drive progress on elec­tronic pay­ments and dig­i­tal bank­ing.</p>
    <p>MAS will also work with the fi­nan­cial ser­vices and fin­tech sec­tors to adopt dig­i­tal so­lu­tions that will strengthen op­er­a­tional re­silience, im­prove pro­duc­tiv­ity, bet­ter man­age risks and en­gage cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“Achiev­ing a high de­gree of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion will be a key source of com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage for our fi­nan­cial sec­tor in the fu­ture,” Mr Thar­man said.</p>
