    <p>About 3,500 madrasah stu­dents will ben­e­fit from a spe­cial Covid-19 dis­burse­ment of $500,000 from the Is­lamic Reli­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) to the six full-time Is­lamic reli­gious schools here.</p>
    <p>This one-off dis­burse­ment, in view of the chal­lenges faced by the madrasah sec­tor dur­ing the pan­demic, will go to­wards sup­port­ing their stu­dent pro­grammes, said Muis yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The six madrasahs are:</p>
    <p>• Madrasah Alju­nied Al-Is­lamiah ($76,459);</p>
    <p>• Madrasah Al­sagoff Al-Ara­biah ($41,246);</p>
    <p>• Madrasah Al-Ara­biah Al-Is­lamiah ($43,490);</p>
    <p>• Madrasah Irsyad Zuhri Al-Is­lamiah ($167,649);</p>
    <p>• Madrasah Al-Ma’arif Al-Is­lamiah ($96,240) and</p>
    <p>• Madrasah Wak Tan­jong Al-Is­lamiah ($74,916).</p>
    <p>This sup­port will be used for stu­dent pro­grammes based on each school’s needs, with the quan­tum based on the en­rol­ment size.</p>
    <p>Madrasahs, which are pri­vate schools, rely heav­ily on the sup­port of the com­mu­nity, said Muis.</p>
    <p>They are sup­ported through school fees and grants from var­i­ous sources such as the Mosque Build­ing and Men­daki Fund (MBMF) as well as gov­ern­ment fund­ing.</p>
    <p>These funds mostly go to­wards man­power and train­ing ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Madrasahs also reg­u­larly un­der­take fund rais­ing to sup­ple­ment the short­fall for the school op­er­a­tional and stu­dent pro­gramme needs.</p>
    <p>How­ever, due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, sev­eral ex­ter­nal fundrais­ing events had to be sus­pended or can­celled. It was also more dif­fi­cult for donors to make do­na­tions phys­i­cally.</p>
    <p>This has re­sulted in a sub­stan­tial short­fall in rev­enue from typ­i­cal fund-rais­ing sources and do­na­tion drives, such as col­lec­tions dur­ing Fri­day con­gre­ga­tional prayers, Muis said.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the im­ple­men­ta­tion of safe man­age­ment mea­sures at the madrasahs has in­creased their op­er­a­tional costs.</p>
    <p>Muis had thus ear­lier worked with the madrasahs to de­velop and launch the OurMadrasa­h.sg por­tal on Dec 4 to raise funds. Over the last few weeks, about $50,000 had been raised through on­line do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Call­ing madrasahs key in­sti­tu­tions for the Mus­lim com­mu­nity, Muis chief ex­ec­u­tive Esa Ma­sood said: “Our madrasah lead­ers, teach­ers and stu­dents have adapted well to the chal­leng­ing sit­u­a­tion over the past year and have con­tin­ued to per­form well.</p>
    <p>“This dis­burse­ment sig­ni­fies Muis’ con­tin­ued sup­port for our madrasahs. We urge the com­mu­nity to rally to­gether and con­tinue to stand in sol­i­dar­ity with our madrasahs so that they can con­tinue the im­por­tant work to nur­ture the next gen­er­a­tion of asati­zah (reli­gious teach­ers) to guide our com­mu­nity.”</p>
