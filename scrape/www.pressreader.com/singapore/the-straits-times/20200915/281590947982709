    <p>Since yes­ter­day, the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) can im­me­di­ately pros­e­cute those who cre­ate se­ri­ous fire safety risks as amend­ments to the Fire Safety Act came into ef­fect. Among the key changes are en­hanced penal­ties for ir­re­spon­si­ble in­dus­try pro­fes­sion­als who fail to prop­erly su­per­vise and cer­tify fire safety works.</p>
    <p>From yes­ter­day, the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) can im­me­di­ately pros­e­cute those who cre­ate se­ri­ous fire safety risks, such as ob­struct­ing fire es­cape routes, as amend­ments to the Fire Safety Act come into ef­fect.</p>
    <p>The Act, which was passed in Par­lia­ment last year, spells out stronger reg­u­la­tory and en­force­ment pow­ers for the SCDF in en­sur­ing fire safety and in­tro­duces new of­fences to stop the use of non-com­pli­ant fire safety prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Among the key changes are en­hanced penal­ties for ir­re­spon­si­ble in­dus­try pro­fes­sion­als who fail to prop­erly su­per­vise and cer­tify fire safety works.</p>
    <p>The SCDF will also be em­pow­ered to man­date build­ing own­ers to im­prove their fire safety fea­tures, such as by in­stalling fire alarm sys­tems and fire hose reels.</p>
    <p>“SCDF will adopt a ju­di­cious, riskbased ap­proach in iden­ti­fy­ing build­ings for fire safety up­grades, and will work closely with the build­ing own­ers to en­hance the fire safety of their build­ings,” said the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA), in a state­ment last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The need for stricter fire safety reg­u­la­tions was high­lighted in the past year, with fire­fight­ers dis­cov­er­ing faulty fire safety equip­ment while re­spond­ing to fire in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>In one in­ci­dent last Novem­ber, fire­men at­tend­ing to a fire in a Bukit Ba­tok Hous­ing Board flat found that the hose reel cab­i­nets in the vicin­ity had been pad­locked and the hose reels were dry. A woman, 60, who was res­cued from the fire later died in the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The Jurong-Cle­menti Town Coun­cil was sub­se­quently served Fire Haz­ard Abate­ment No­tices for not com­ply­ing with fire safety re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Last month, fire­fight­ers dis­cov­ered a faulty wet riser in a Toa Payoh HDB block while re­spond­ing to a fire there. In­ves­ti­ga­tions are still on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­fore yes­ter­day, SCDF could take pros­e­cu­to­rial ac­tion only when the er­rant par­ties who cause fire safety risks fail to com­ply with their no­tices, said MHA.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with the new amend­ments to the Fire Safety Act, the SCDF can take im­me­di­ate pros­e­cu­to­rial ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The SCDF will soon be able to de­mand that all non-com­pli­ant fire safety prod­ucts be re­moved, dis­posed of or re­called.</p>
    <p>It will also be il­le­gal for any­one to sup­ply or in­stall such prod­ucts, with the SCDF able to take ac­tion against any party in the sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>In the state­ment, the MHA also an­nounced that emer­gency pre­pared­ness mea­sures must be put in place at build­ings be­ing used as hos­pi­tals, nurs­ing homes, dis­abil­ity homes and worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The SCDF will be em­pow­ered to spec­ify what type of Com­pany Emer­gency Re­sponse Team and fire safety equip­ment are re­quired at the dif­fer­ent premises.</p>

        <p data-role="text">The charred re&#xAD;mains of a fam&#xAD;ily&#x2019;s be&#xAD;long&#xAD;ings in a Bukit Ba&#xAD;tok flat after a fire broke out last Novem&#xAD;ber. Fire&#xAD;men at&#xAD;tend&#xAD;ing to the fire found that hose reel cab&#xAD;i&#xAD;nets in the vicin&#xAD;ity had been pad&#xAD;locked and that hose reels were dry.
