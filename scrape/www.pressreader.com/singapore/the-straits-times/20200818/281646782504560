    <p>A grant that helps Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents who have lost their jobs or suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant in­come loss due to the pan­demic will be ex­tended till De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, which pro­vides up to $800 a month for three months, opened in May and were ini­tially due to close af­ter Sept 30.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the ex­ten­sion in a min­is­te­rial state­ment yes­ter­day, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said the scheme has dis­bursed more than $90 mil­lion to over 60,000 res­i­dents so far.</p>
    <p>To qual­ify for the grant, un­em­ployed ap­pli­cants must demon­strate job search or train­ing ef­forts, among other things.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing re­cip­i­ents of the grant can also ap­ply to re­new their sup­port for an­other three months, if they remain el­i­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment will an­nounce details early next month, said Mr Heng, who is also Finance Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He noted that Sin­ga­pore’s labour mar­ket is likely to remain weak be­yond this year. Ob­servers have said that more re­trench­ments are ex­pected in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Heng: “We are study­ing how to con­tinue sup­port­ing em­ploy­ees and self-em­ployed persons who are most vul­ner­a­ble.”</p>
    <p>An­other group that Sin­ga­pore has to look out for is low-wage work­ers, he added. He an­nounced that more work­ers will be el­i­gi­ble for the Work­fare Spe­cial Payment, a $3,000 cash pay­out that will ben­e­fit lower-in­come work­ers.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, those on the Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment (WIS) scheme for work done last year are el­i­gi­ble for the pay­out. Go­ing for­ward, those who were not on WIS last year but who have re­ceived or will be re­ceiv­ing WIS for work done this year, can also qual­ify.</p>
    <p>The WIS tops up the salaries of lower-in­come Sin­ga­pore­ans. En­hance­ments to the scheme kicked in this year, with the qual­i­fy­ing in­come cap raised to $2,300 per month. Among other cri­te­ria, those aged 35 and above can qual­ify for WIS. Each el­i­gi­ble in­di­vid­ual can only qual­ify for and re­ceive the $3,000 payment once.</p>
    <p>This payment will be given in two equal parts – last month and in Oc­to­ber – to work­ers who were el­i­gi­ble for WIS for their work done last year.</p>
    <p>Those who re­ceived WIS for work done this year will re­ceive the $3,000 pay­out from Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees’ el­i­gi­bil­ity for WIS and the Work­fare Spe­cial Payment will be au­to­mat­i­cally as­sessed based on Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund con­tri­bu­tions made by their em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Those who are self-em­ployed will have to de­clare their in­come and make their re­quired Medis­ave con­tri­bu­tion by Dec 31 next year for work done this year, or by March 31 next year for work done last year.</p>
    <p>Labour MP Mohd Fahmi Ali­man wel­comed the re­vised cri­te­ria to the Work­fare Spe­cial Payment, which will ben­e­fit work­ers who are earn­ing less now or who have moved into lower-pay­ing jobs.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser cheered the ex­ten­sion of the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, but said it is “at best, a stop-gap mea­sure”.</p>
    <p>“If we agree that the ap­proach of con­tin­u­ally dish­ing out money is not sus­tain­able, then it boils down to part­ner­ing busi­nesses to cre­ate jobs,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Ong Qiyan, a deputy di­rec­tor at NUS’ So­cial Ser­vice Re­search Cen­tre, said it is crit­i­cal to en­sure that those who have re­duced work hours or in­come are able to at­tend train­ing pro­grammes which can im­prove their job prospects.</p>
    <p>They may face bar­ri­ers in do­ing so, for ex­am­ple, if they lack em­ployer sup­port, she said.</p>
