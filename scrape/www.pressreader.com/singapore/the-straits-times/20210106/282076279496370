    <p>The Asean Sec­re­tariat should look at ways to set up a re­gional air travel bub­ble for pan-Asean leisure travel with no quar­an­tine, a re­port by the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign (SUTD) has said.</p>
    <p>It ob­served that cur­rent mea­sures that pro­mote in­tra-Asean es­sen­tial or busi­ness travel have not been ef­fec­tive in restor­ing air pas­sen­ger num­bers, as they ap­plied to less than 1 per cent of peo­ple who would have made the trips last year.</p>
    <p>The White Pa­per, pub­lished last month and ti­tled Restart­ing In­ter­na­tional Air Travel Within Asean, makes a case, us­ing flight statis­tics from var­i­ous sources, for al­low­ing the restart of quar­an­tine-free re­gional tourism. It says that is the most ef­fec­tive next step that gov­ern­ments can take to pull their avi­a­tion in­dus­tries out of the dol­drums amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Asean’s avi­a­tion and travel sec­tors are al­ready reel­ing, and the eco­nomic im­pact could be­come dev­as­tat­ing with­out a par­tial re­cov­ery of leisure travel,” the re­port, writ­ten by in­de­pen­dent avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Bren­dan So­bie of So­bie Avi­a­tion, warned. “Air travel bub­bles rep­re­sent a plat­form to sup­port a par­tial re­cov­ery of the in­tra-Asean air trans­port mar­ket in 2021.”</p>
    <p>The pa­per, com­mis­sioned by SUTD’s Avi­a­tion Stud­ies In­sti­tute, which was es­tab­lished jointly with the Civil Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, bases its rec­om­men­da­tion on global trends as well as re­gional flight pat­terns.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing its cue from other re­gions such as Europe, Africa, the Mid­dle East and the Amer­i­cas, the re­port said air travel in the near term will likely fo­cus on short-dis­tance re­gional flights, as more pas­sen­gers are re­luc­tant to travel too far dur­ing the pan­demic or the ini­tial post-pan­demic pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Even now, it said, the re­sump­tion of in­tra-Asean travel is al­ready lag­ging be­hind that in other re­gions, and air­lines in the 10 Asean coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, can­not keep up cur­rent un­eco­nomic lev­els with­out sig­nif­i­cant changes.</p>
    <p>“Asean air­lines have a press­ing need to re­build rev­enue streams. For the three months end­ing Sept 30, 2020, Asean-based pub­licly traded air­line groups re­ported in their quar­terly fi­nan­cial state­ments rev­enue de­clines of 75 per cent to 94 per cent,” the pa­per said.</p>
    <p>Two small air­lines in Asean have shut down since the start of the pan­demic, and two larger ones are re­ha­bil­i­tat­ing with su­per­vi­sion from bank­ruptcy courts.</p>
    <p>Prior to the pan­demic, about four mil­lion peo­ple flew be­tween Asean coun­tries ev­ery month. Be­tween April and Oc­to­ber last year, the num­ber fell to fewer than 100,000 peo­ple, mostly con­sist­ing of oneway repa­tri­at­ing or worker traf­fic.</p>
    <p>In a nor­mal year, travel within Asean makes up about a fifth of to­tal air pas­sen­ger traf­fic in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The pa­per said an air travel bub­ble elim­i­nates the need for quar­an­tine – the big­gest de­ter­rence to re­gional tourism now.</p>
    <p>“Most vis­i­tors trav­el­ling be­tween Asean coun­tries are typ­i­cally short-stay vis­i­tors who would nor­mally visit for a pe­riod that is sig­nif­i­cantly less than the quar­an­tine pe­riod,” it said.</p>
    <p>But the pa­per also noted that a pan-Asean air travel bub­ble need not ap­ply to all mem­bers at once, and could be lim­ited to those that do not have many un­trace­able in­fec­tions. It cited the Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong model where ar­range­ments would be sus­pended, as they cur­rently are, if un­linked Covid-19 in­fec­tions ex­ceeded five cases on a seven-day mov­ing av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the Covid-19 task force here, has pre­vi­ously said a blan­ket travel bub­ble is dif­fi­cult to im­ple­ment for all coun­tries in the re­gion ow­ing to their dif­fer­ent in­ci­dence rates. He said then that Sin­ga­pore will still look at the sit­u­a­tion “coun­try by coun­try”, and ap­ply the ap­pro­pri­ate prin­ci­ples to in­di­vid­ual coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion Stud­ies In­sti­tute di­rec­tor Peter Jack­son said: “We com­mis­sioned this White Pa­per to cap­ture the ex­tent of the down­turn in avi­a­tion within the Asean re­gion and to answer a few ba­sic ques­tions. We hope it con­trib­utes to mul­ti­lat­eral dis­cus­sions on de­ter­min­ing a path for­ward.”</p>
