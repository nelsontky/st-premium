    <p>JERUSALEM • The scene cuts from Dubai to Tel Aviv, the lyrics switch from Ara­bic to He­brew to English and the song is a slightly kitsch elec­tro-pop duet by artists who, for now, re­main apart.</p>
    <p>The nor­mal­i­sa­tion of ties be­tween Is­rael and the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE) has pro­duced its first mu­si­cal col­lab­o­ra­tion: Ah­lan Bik, or Hello You in Ara­bic.</p>
    <p>“This is a his­toric mo­ment,” said Is­raeli singer Elkana Marziano, whose duet with Emi­rati artist Walid Al­jasim has clocked more than 1.1 mil­lion YouTube views since it was posted on Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Marziano, 28, is a for­mer win­ner of Is­rael’s ver­sion of The Voice, a singing com­pe­ti­tion tele­vi­sion show, and an Ara­bic speaker in­flu­enced by the Mizrahi cul­ture of Jews from the Arab world.</p>
    <p>He said he and Al­jasim had col­lab­o­rated over the Zoom video­con­fer­enc­ing ser­vice, with some parts of the song recorded in Dubai and oth­ers in Is­rael.</p>
    <p>“The un­der­stand­ing was im­me­di­ate,” Marziano said of the part­ner­ship.</p>
    <p>One on­line com­menter, who posted un­der the name Shaked Sharon, said: “With this song, you feel the new Mid­dle East.”</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, Is­rael and the UAE an­nounced they had reached a United States-bro­kered deal to nor­malise ties, fol­low­ing years of dis­creet eco­nomic and se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Is­rael’s Par­lia­ment, the Knes­set, ap­proved the UAE deal last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Bahrain ul­ti­mately j oined the pact known as the Abra­ham Ac­cords signed at the White House last month, mak­ing it and the UAE the third and fourth Arab states to es­tab­lish full diplo­matic ties with Is­rael.</p>
    <p>Is­rael signed a peace agree­ment with neigh­bour­ing Egypt in 1979 and with Jor­dan in 1994.</p>
    <p>Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu has boasted that the Gulf deals high­light shift­ing pri­or­i­ties in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The right-winger has i nsisted that more Arab states want ties with Is­rael even though its con­flict with the Pales­tini­ans re­mains un­re­solved.</p>
    <p>The UAE’s Sheikh Mo­hammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, has said the pact “opens the way to a new era of co­op­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Pales­tinian lead­ers have con­demned the deals and called on the Arab world to with­hold estab­lish­ing ties with Is­rael un­til it reaches a vi­able peace with the Pales­tini­ans.</p>
    <p>While some YouTube com­menters have cel­e­brated Ah­lan Bik, oth­ers have con­demned the song and Is­raeli-Emi­rati nor­mal­i­sa­tion, while call­ing for the cre­ation of a Pales­tinian state.</p>
    <p>The song was writ­ten by Is­raeli com­poser Doron Medalie, who also wrote Toy, which won the 2018 Euro­vi­sion con­test in Is­rael.</p>
    <p>The cho­rus – “I hear you friend far away, far away” – is re­peated in the three l an­guages, while the mu­sic video’s ac­tion piv­ots from Marziano danc­ing with friends in Is­rael to Al­jasim in Dubai.</p>
    <p>Marziano said peace was a com­mon theme in Is­raeli mu­sic. The Mid­dle East­ern coun­try has reg­u­larly been in con­flict with its neigh­bours since its found­ing in 1948.</p>
    <p>He said it was a “per­sonal vic­tory” to see young Is­raelis and Emi­ratis in­ter­act­ing on­line to dis­cuss the song on his YouTube page, adding that he is plan­ning a live con­cert with Al­jasim when the coro­n­avirus pan­demic ends.</p>
    <p>“I am moved by the i dea of singing this song, and oth­ers, on the same stage with Al­jasim,” Marziano said.</p>
