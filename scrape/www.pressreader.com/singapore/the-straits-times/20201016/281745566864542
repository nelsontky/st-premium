    <p>Three new coro­n­avirus cases were re­ported yes­ter­day, bring­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,892, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>None of these were com­mu­nity cases.</p>
    <p>Two of the three new cases were im­ported, com­pris­ing a Sin­ga­porean who re­turned from the United States, and a work per­mit holder who re­turned from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Both im­ported cases were placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The last new case was a pa­tient from a worker’s dor­mi­tory who was de­tected through rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dorms. He was asymp­to­matic when tested.</p>
    <p>Mo­ham­madi Res­tau­rant in Lembu Road in Lit­tle In­dia was added yes­ter­day to the list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient was at the res­tau­rant last Satur­day be­tween 1pm and 2pm.</p>
    <p>MOH said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid places on the list as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited to get peo­ple who were at these places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the gov.sg web­site.</p>
    <p>MOH also said that the Covid-19 clus­ter at SCM Tuas Lodge has been closed as it has had no new cases linked to it for 28 days, or two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from an av­er­age of one case per day two weeks ago, to an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also de­creased from a daily av­er­age of fewer than one case per day to none in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 12 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,749 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 36 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 64 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
