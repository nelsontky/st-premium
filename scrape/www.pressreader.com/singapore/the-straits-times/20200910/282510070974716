    <p>SIA</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian singer-song­writer Sia (left) be­gan cov­er­ing her face with wigs dur­ing live per­for­mances in the early 2010s.</p>
    <p>In 2016, she went on the seg­ment Car­pool Karaoke and ex­plained to host James Cor­den: “I don’t wear this un­less there are cam­eras around. I only wear this just to try and main­tain a mod­icum of pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>“I thought what doesn’t ex­ist in pop mu­sic at the mo­ment, and it was mys­tery.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Chan­de­lier singer made a rare ap­pear­ance sans mask at the Fash­ion Los An­ge­les Awards last year. She said she was not there as a pop star, but as a friend of fash­ion de­signer Chris­tian Siri­ano.</p>
    <p>DAFT PUNK</p>
    <p>Known for their trippy, syn­the­sised beats, French elec­tronic mu­sic duo Daft Punk (left) are also fa­mous for hid­ing their faces be­hind fu­tur­is­tic-look­ing ro­bot hel­mets.</p>
    <p>Con­sist­ing of Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Ban­gal­ter, the group per­formed with­out head­gear in their early days in the mid-1990s, but started con­ceal­ing their faces in 1999.</p>
    <p>Ban­gal­ter was once quoted in a Vice mag­a­zine ar­ti­cle as say­ing: “(In 1999), we were do­ing a track and our sam­pler crashed and ex­ploded and there were sparks... We were hurt a lit­tle bit so we had to make a lit­tle surgery and then we be­came robots.”</p>
    <p>SLIP­KNOT</p>
    <p>Their mu­sic is dark and scary, and so are their masks.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can heavy metal band Slip­knot’s nine mem­bers (left) have donned a va­ri­ety of creepy-look­ing dis­guises, from sin­is­ter clowns to nail-pro­trud­ing head­pieces that re­sem­ble the Pin­head char­ac­ter from the Hell­raiser hor­ror film fran­chise (1987 to 2018).</p>
    <p>Masks have been part of the band’s im­age since their early days in the 1990s. Lead singer Corey Tay­lor once told NY Rock web­site: “It’s our way of be­com­ing more in­ti­mate with the mu­sic. It’s a way for us to be­come un­con­scious of who we are and what we do out­side of mu­sic.”</p>
