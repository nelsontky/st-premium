    <p>For me, like many Sin­ga­pore­ans, a face mask was once some­thing I wore only when the haze turned our blue skies grey.</p>
    <p>But with the Covid-19 pan­demic, wear­ing a face mask out­doors is now as es­sen­tial as don­ning swimwear at the swim­ming pool.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment and my com­pany have given out free face masks. I have also bought four boxes of dis­pos­able ones.</p>
    <p>But, de­spite hav­ing enough to prob­a­bly last through the rest of this wretched year, I have still been search­ing for the per­fect face mask. It proved elu­sive, even though I had just two cri­te­ria, un­til last week.</p>
    <p>First, I was look­ing for some­thing en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly.</p>
    <p>While dis­pos­able face masks are hy­gienic and con­ve­nient, they can be an en­vi­ron­men­tal haz­ard.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, peo­ple have been throw­ing them away in­dis­crim­i­nately – I reg­u­larly find dis­carded face masks at void decks, carparks, park con­nec­tors and even on my air-con­di­tioner ledge.</p>
    <p>As for re­us­able face masks, the Gov­ern­ment-is­sued ones are just too small for my big face.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, I was look­ing for a work­out-friendly face mask.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause I wear one when I go jog­ging, de­spite the Gov­ern­ment al­low­ing us to go with­out a mask when we are work­ing out.</p>
    <p>Be­ing the ki­asi (“afraid to die” in Hokkien) Sin­ga­porean that I am, and hav­ing read how the coro­n­avirus can po­ten­tially stay air­borne for hours, I have de­cided to err on the side of cau­tion.</p>
    <p>Not to men­tion, I have seen too many “jog­gers” out in force at parks and beaches who are not ex­actly work­ing out – merely tak­ing a stroll with­out masks.</p>
    <p>Once, when run­ning late at night, I ran into a fam­ily of four tak­ing a mid­night stroll in the park with­out their masks on.</p>
    <p>Thus, I need a re­us­able face mask that will al­low me to jog with­out chok­ing me to death.</p>
    <p>Many face masks have ex­ha­la­tion valves to im­prove ven­ti­la­tion and pre­vent the fog­ging up of the wearer’s glasses.</p>
    <p>But those are a no-go for me. As pop­u­lar lo­cal per­son­al­ity Mr Brown ex­plained in his tweet ear­lier this month, he will stay far away from those who wear such face masks, be­cause the valves let un­fil­tered air flow out­wards.</p>
    <p>I am with Mr Brown on this – the point of a face mask is to not only pro­tect your­self, but also to pro­tect oth­ers from you.</p>
    <p>The droplets you dish out might con­tain germs and bac­te­ria po­ten­tially harm­ful to oth­ers. So, face masks with ex­ha­la­tion valves are out.</p>
    <p>I have tried a face mask with a mo­torised fan that charges via a mi­cro-USB ca­ble. It pulls air out from in­side the face mask to ex­pel through a fil­ter.</p>
    <p>While it pro­tects ev­ery­one, the fil­ter has to be changed af­ter every use. And some­times (or most of the time), th­ese fil­ters are sold out.</p>
    <p>So, when Un­der Ar­mour (UA) launched its Sports­mask – a re­us­able, wa­ter-re­sis­tant per­for­mance face mask with­out ex­ha­la­tion valves or a mo­torised fan, de­signed for work­outs and max­i­mum breatha­bil­ity – last month in the United States, it piqued my in­ter­est im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>The face mask, avail­able in black and in four sizes, sold out quickly upon launch in the US. It ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore last week, sell­ing at $35 a piece and promptly sold out too. But UA sent me one, so I got to try it. And I think I have fi­nally found the per­fect face mask.</p>
    <p>The Sports­mask has three lay­ers – a wa­ter-re­sis­tant outer shell with breath­able fab­ric; a polyuretha­ne open-cell foam mid­dle layer that lets air through but stops mois­ture and sweat; and an in­ner layer with UA’s pro­pri­etary ISO-Chill fab­ric lining, which is sup­posed to feel cool against your skin.</p>
    <p>The ear loops also have this lining, while the face mask has been given an anti-mi­cro­bial treat­ment to in­hibit bac­te­ria in the mask, ac­cord­ing to UA.</p>
    <p>A mould­able nose-bridge helps se­cure the face mask in place and mit­i­gate air flow to the eyes. It even has a small, handy cloth stor­age bag.</p>
    <p>When I first put on the Sports­mask, it felt re­ally com­fort­able, de­spite be­ing a lit­tle heav­ier than a con­ven­tional face mask.</p>
    <p>It did not bob­ble much or fog up my glasses dur­ing my jogs. More im­por­tantly, it had amaz­ing breatha­bil­ity when I was jog­ging – akin to wear­ing those thin dis­pos­able face masks when you are walk­ing.</p>
    <p>The down­side is that it is sup­posed to last only 35 washes (ei­ther ma­chine- or hand-washed), though this is slightly more than the usual 30 washes spec­i­fied by most re­us­able face masks.</p>
    <p>But I am sold and will be get­ting two – the pur­chase limit UA im­poses on each per­son.</p>
    <p>The UA Sports­mask is sold only via the Sin­ga­pore UA on­line store and the three UA stores in Or­chard Cen­tral, Vivoc­ity and Fu­nan.</p>
    <p>New stocks are ex­pected to ar­rive soon.</p>
