    <p>Great East­ern Hold­ings posted a 40 per cent rise in net profit to $287.9 mil­lion for the third quar­ter ended Sept 30, from $205.1 mil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>The in­sur­ance arm of OCBC Bank yes­ter­day said this was mainly due to higher val­u­a­tion of in­vest­ments, on the back of im­proved fi­nan­cial mar­ket con­di­tions dur­ing the quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Op­er­at­ing profit slipped 4 per cent to $171.4 mil­lion, from $178.5 mil­lion a year ear­lier. This was due to greater new busi­ness strain re­sult­ing from higher sales in Sin­ga­pore, Great East­ern said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, non-op­er­at­ing profit came in at $50 mil­lion for the third quar­ter, re­vers­ing from a loss of $31.3 mil­lion in the pre­ced­ing year.</p>
    <p>Profit from the share­hold­ers’ fund rose 20 per cent to $74.9 mil­lion, from $62.3 mil­lion a year ago, owing to higher mark-to-mar­ket gains from equities, the in­surer noted.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, a pickup in ac­tiv­ity across all mar­kets led to a 36 per cent growth in to­tal weighted new sales to $432.8 mil­lion, from $317.5 mil­lion in the year-ago pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Amid higher sales, new busi­ness em­bed­ded value edged up 2 per cent to $160.2 mil­lion, from $157.4 mil­lion in the cor­re­spond­ing pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Group chief ex­ec­u­tive Khor Hock Seng said Great East­ern’s fo­cus on strength­en­ing its dis­tri­bu­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties paid off in the first nine months of the year. He noted that the group was able to adapt in the cur­rent op­er­at­ing en­vi­ron­ment by cap­i­tal­is­ing on its dig­i­tal and tech­nol­ogy in­fra­struc­ture, which con­trib­uted to higher sales.</p>
    <p>The group now has an agency force size of over 30,000 across the re­gion, he said. “We are com­mit­ted to boost­ing hir­ing and of­fer­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties amid em­ploy­ment un­cer­tain­ties. In Sin­ga­pore, we have hired over 1,000 fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tives, wel­com­ing re­cruits from a range of di­verse back­grounds, such as fresh grad­u­ates and mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als.”</p>
    <p>Great East­ern shares closed 0.67 per cent up at $17.90 on Tues­day.</p>
