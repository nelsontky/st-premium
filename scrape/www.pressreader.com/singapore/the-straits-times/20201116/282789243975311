    <p>Hong Kong ac­tor Savio Tsang, who is known mainly for his sup­port­ing roles in Hong Kong tele­vi­sion se­ri­als, died of lung cancer last Thurs­day. He was 58.</p>
    <p>There were ru­mours that he was in crit­i­cal con­di­tion last Thurs­day, with his death con­firmed by ac­tress Candy Man on Face­book last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Man, 60, wrote in Chi­nese: “We worked to­gether on your de­but TV se­rial. Didn’t you say we should work to­gether again the last time we met? Rest in peace.”</p>
    <p>She was re­fer­ring to the TV se­rial The Gen­eral (1982), which starred Kenny Ho, Rosamund Kwan and New­ton Lai.</p>
    <p>Be­sides a more re­cent photo of her with Tsang, Man also posted other pic­tures of them to­gether from the pe­riod drama Su­per Hero (1983), in which they played a cou­ple.</p>
    <p>Tsang’s for­mer girl­friend, ac­tress Mui Siu Wai, whom he dated for 13 years be­fore they broke up due to an al­leged third party, told the Hong Kong me­dia that she had not met Tsang for more than 10 years.</p>
    <p>Mui, 54, said she also learnt of his death from the me­dia and said she would at­tend his fu­neral .</p>
    <p>Tsang was last seen in pub­lic in November last year while film­ing the TVB va­ri­ety show Can­topop At 50.</p>
    <p>While pro­mot­ing the TV se­rial Find­ing Her Voice in Oc­to­ber last year, he said he was hav­ing lung prob­lems and could only make guest ap­pear­ances on shows.</p>
    <p>Find­ing Her Voice also starred dis­graced ac­tress Jac­que­line Wong, who was caught in a cheat­ing scan­dal with mar­ried singer Andy Hui in April last year. The se­ries was taken out of cold stor­age after be­ing ini­tially canned.</p>
    <p>Tsang did not at­tend the cel­e­bra­tory din­ner for Find­ing Her Voice in De­cem­ber. He also did not at­tend the se­rial’s char­ity din­ner in Kuala Lumpur with co-stars Hugo Ng, Ram Chi­ang, Jimmy Au and Joe Tay in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Tsang grad­u­ated from then Red­if­fu­sion Tele­vi­sion’s fi­nal artist train­ing pro­gramme and rose to promi­nence after play­ing a po­lice­man in the TV se­rial 101 Cit­i­zen Ar­rest (1983), in which he won Best New­comer at the Asia Tele­vi­sion Awards. He joined TVB in 1990 and played mostly sup­port­ing roles in the sta­tion’s se­ri­als. He joined Hong Kong Tele­vi­sion Net­work in 2012 be­fore re­turn­ing to TVB three years later.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Find­ing Her Voice, his re­cent TV works in­clude The Man Who Kills Trou­bles and Line Walker: Bull Fight, which is cur­rently show­ing on tele­vi­sion.</p>
