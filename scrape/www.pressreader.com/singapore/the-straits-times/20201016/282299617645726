    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic is now close to eight months and count­ing, and sport has not been spared, par­tic­u­larly in Asia, with many events get­ting canned.</p>
    <p>Since May, global com­pe­ti­tions have re­sumed, with the Na­tional Football League (NFL) the last to get un­der way last month as the pre­vi­ous cam­paign ended at the out­set of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Asian gov­ern­ments have taken a more hard­line ap­proach to deal­ing with the cri­sis – China in July called off all ma­jor sport­ing events for the rest of this year. The mega tele­vi­sion deals as­so­ci­ated with Euro­pean and Amer­i­can-based sports, how­ever, mean the show must go on else­where.</p>
    <p>Through the cross adap­tion of mea­sures and en­act­ing of a con­trolled bio­sphere, they have had vary­ing de­grees of suc­cess in min­imis­ing the risk of con­tract­ing the virus, al­though all events con­tinue to be held ei­ther be­hind closed doors or in front of a re­stricted crowds.</p>
    <p>NBA’S AIR­TIGHT BUB­BLE</p>
    <p>The big­gest suc­cess story has to be the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA). Last Sun­day, the 2019-20 sea­son wrapped up, with the league re­port­ing zero Covid-19 cases after three months and 172 games in its Dis­ney World “bub­ble” in Or­lando, Florida.</p>
    <p>Only one other league has man­aged such a blem­ish-free record, with the Na­tional Hockey League (NHL) con­clud­ing its play-offs in its two bub­bles in Ed­mon­ton and Toronto, Canada with­out a pos­i­tive case.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that NBA games would go off with­out a hitch, the league im­ple­mented the most air­tight con­trols seen to date.</p>
    <p>Play­ers, staff and me­dia had to spend more than 100 days away from their loved ones at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Com­plex, with ev­ery­thing from food to en­ter­tain­ment con­tained within the cam­pus. Covid-19 test­ing was</p>
    <p>It ap­pears the NBA, NHL and MLS’ bub­ble for­mat best re­duces the chances of get­ting Covid-19, but a hy­brid model re­volv­ing around match days or for the du­ra­tion of an event can equally work well pro­vided mea­sures are taken se­ri­ously and en­forced.</p>
    <p>car­ried out at reg­u­lar in­ter­vals and around the clock. The cam­pus it­self was split into zones, with no one al­lowed to en­ter, leave or cross over with­out per­mis­sion and in­frac­tions were not tol­er­ated.</p>
    <p>Play­ers like Hous­ton Rock­ets for­ward Danuel House were ex­pelled from the bub­ble for break­ing the rules. Even those leav­ing the cam­pus with writ­ten per­mis­sion were sub­jected to quar­an­tine or­ders on re­turn, like the Los An­ge­les Clip­pers pair of Mon­trezl Har­rell and Lou Wil­liams.</p>
    <p>So­cial dis­tanc­ing and the wear­ing of masks were made com­pul­sory. Play­ers also wore Mag­icBands and Kinexon SafeZone tags – smart wrist­bands that track health screen­ing in­for­ma­tion, where­abouts and se­cu­rity clear­ance. They also alert play­ers when they break safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and mon­i­tor who they are in close con­tact with, fa­cil­i­tat­ing con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>While the NBA is keen to avoid another re­peat of the bub­ble next sea­son – which is set to start in Jan­uary – the league knows that its form of a bub­ble is a proven con­cept that works.</p>
    <p>“Work­ing to­gether, teams and play­ers, we found a way to play through a pan­demic, keep ev­ery­one safe,” NBA com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver said. “For that, ev­ery team de­serves to be cel­e­brated.”</p>
    <p>Like the NBA, Ma­jor League Soccer re­sumed its sea­son in the same bub­ble un­der the same re­stric­tions, al­though it was a one-month ex­per­i­ment dubbed the “MLS is back Tour­na­ment”. There were no Covid-19 cases while teams were in­side the bub­ble, but the com­pe­ti­tion has since rev­erted back to the usual home-and-away for­mat at their usual sta­di­ums.</p>
    <p>Since Au­gust, there have been at least 17 con­firmed cases among play­ers and a string of post­poned games, re­in­forc­ing how ef­fec­tive a se­cure bub­ble can be.</p>
    <p>SEMI-BUB­BLES IN OTHER SPORTS</p>
    <p>Ten­nis’ Grand Slam tour­na­ments recom­menced with the US Open in Au­gust held within a bub­ble in New York. Play­ers were con­fined to one of two des­ig­nated ho­tels or a se­lected house in the case of world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic, and were not per­mit­ted to leave ex­cept to train or play matches.</p>
    <p>Daily tem­per­a­ture checks, reg­u­lar Covid-19 test­ing, so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, and re­stricted times spent in shared fa­cil­i­ties like locker rooms, train­ing fa­cil­i­ties and on-site gyms meant Benoit Paire was the only player who tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The French Open, which ended last weekend, em­ployed less strin­gent rules. While play­ers were al­lowed to move only be­tween a ho­tel and Roland Gar­ros, the ho­tel was open to out­side guests.</p>
    <p>De­spite some scares like Alexander Zverev re­port­ing a high fever and some play­ers like Fer­nando Ver­dasco and Damir Dzumhur be­ing barred from par­tic­i­pat­ing after pos­i­tive pre-tour­na­ment tests, no one was in­fected in the Paris bub­ble.</p>
    <p>In For­mula One, its bub­ble is only in op­er­a­tion on race week­ends and has the same re­stric­tive pro­to­cols as other sports de­signed to stem the spread of the virus. The mea­sures have had mixed re­sults: one driver, Ser­gio Perez of Rac­ing Point, tested pos­i­tive after mak­ing a per­sonal trip to Mex­ico, while a num­ber of team staff have also con­tracted Covid.</p>
    <p>Golf’s PGA Tour also em­ploys sim­i­lar mea­sures for its events across the United States, lean­ing on char­tered flights and pre­de­ter­mined host ho­tels in ad­di­tion to reg­u­lar test­ing and the re­quire­ment of a neg­a­tive di­ag­no­sis in or­der to par­tic­i­pate. There was a slew of pos­i­tive cases when the cir­cuit first re­sumed in June, but the numbers have ta­pered off al­though world No. 1 Dustin John­son, ear­lier this week, be­came the high­est-pro­file golfer to be in­fected.</p>
    <p>NO BUB­BLE</p>
    <p>Un­like the NBA and MLS,</p>
    <p>Euro­pean football and the NFL have es­chewed the bub­ble model due to con­straints and also a pref­er­ence to stick with its usual for­mat.</p>
    <p>The big five Euro­pean football leagues, in gen­eral, have man­aged to pre­vent mass Covid-19 out­breaks among play­ers and staff since March, with cases typ­i­cally iso­lated.</p>
    <p>The Bun­desliga got the ball rolling with dis­in­fected equip­ment, reg­u­lar Covid-19 test­ing be­fore and after games, safe dis­tanc­ing in place, com­pul­sory wear­ing of masks, and pro­mot­ing non-phys­i­cal con­tact for cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>Play­ers are iso­lated in ho­tels just be­fore games and those who test pos­i­tive are sub­ject to seven or 14 days of self-iso­la­tion de­pend­ing on state reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The Premier League has largely copied the Ger­man league’s tem­plate, with the English top flight re­quir­ing play­ers to self-iso­late for seven days in the event of a pos­i­tive test, while</p>
    <p>Ital­ian Serie A play­ers have to quar­an­tine for 10 days.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the in­ter­sec­tion be­tween the paus­ing of do­mes­tic com­pe­ti­tion for in­ter­na­tional games, or when there is a break in com­pe­ti­tion, has ex­posed a loop­hole for the virus to slip through, espe­cially when play­ers travel abroad.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, Ju­ven­tus’ Cris­tiano Ron­aldo be­came the big­gest name in football to get Covid-19 after be­ing in­fected on in­ter­na­tional duty with Por­tu­gal.</p>
    <p>Last month, there was a clus­ter of cases at French cham­pi­ons Paris Saint-Ger­main after Ney­mar and sev­eral of his team­mates came down with the virus after par­ty­ing in Spain dur­ing the off-sea­son.</p>
    <p>CHAL­LENGES RE­MAIN</p>
    <p>Not all com­pe­ti­tions have, how­ever, done as well in keep­ing out the virus, with the NFL’s lax mea­sures be­ing called out.</p>
    <p>A full-fledged out­break has hit the Ten­nessee Ti­tans – 24 play­ers and staff have been in­fected – and there has been a string of post­pone­ments ow­ing to pos­i­tive cases at other teams.</p>
    <p>The league, only this week, be­gan poly­merase chain re­ac­tion – or PCR – test­ing on game days and the use of masks in walk-throughs.</p>
    <p>NFL chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Allen Sills has been adamant the com­pe­ti­tion will not shift to a bub­ble ow­ing to the “emo­tional” and “be­havioural health toll” it takes, al­though NFL com­mis­sioner Roger Good­ell ear­lier this week hinted that of­fi­cials may need to be “flex­i­ble and adapt­able” if cases con­tinue to rise.</p>
    <p>It ap­pears the NBA, NHL and MLS’ bub­ble for­mat best re­duces the chances of get­ting Covid-19, but a hy­brid model re­volv­ing around match days or for the du­ra­tion of an event can equally work well pro­vided mea­sures are taken se­ri­ously and en­forced.</p>
    <p>After all, in the Covid era, the safety chain is only as strong as the weak­est link.</p>
