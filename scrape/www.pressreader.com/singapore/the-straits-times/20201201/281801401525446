    <p>At a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Kuala Lumpur po­lice chief Sai­ful Azly Ka­marud­din said a urine test re­vealed that the man was on med­i­ca­tion. “It is also un­der­stood that he has some men­tal health is­sues. No record of treat­ment has been found yet, but his friends and fam­ily have said this,” Datuk Sai­ful said, adding that the sus­pect has been re­manded for seven days.</p>

    <p>“I heard a loud noise and shouts and then the wife scream­ing for help. My hus­band went out to... help but when we saw the man out­side the door look­ing back at us, we went back in­side.</p>
    <p>“I’ve seen the lit­tle boy be­fore. This is such a shock,” she said.</p>
    <p>An­other neigh­bour, who also asked not to be named, showed re­porters the blood spat­ter on the stair­case out­side the apart­ment unit, said to be from in­juries suf­fered by fam­ily mem­bers as they fled their home.</p>
