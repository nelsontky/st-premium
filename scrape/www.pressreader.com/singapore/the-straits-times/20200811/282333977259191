    <p>SYL­VA­NIA (Ohio) • With only one more LPGA event be­fore the year’s first women’s Ma­jor, the Women’s Bri­tish Open, Danielle Kang will be the heavy favourite in Scot­land, es­pe­cially as the top South Korean golfers, in­clud­ing world No. 1 Ko Jin-young will not be trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can so­lid­i­fied her sta­tus as the sport’s most in-form player af­ter she com­pleted back-to­back LPGA Tour tri­umphs – the first to do so since China’s Feng Shan­shan in 2017 – by win­ning the Marathon Clas­sic on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Kang closed with a fi­nal round three-un­der 68 to fin­ish at 15-un­der 269, one clear of overnight leader Ly­dia Ko (73) and Eng­land’s Jodi Ewart Shad­off (67).</p>
    <p>The victory, which moved Kang two places up to world No. 2, came a week af­ter she landed the Drive On Cham­pi­onship, the Tour’s first tour­na­ment since it was shut down in Fe­bru­ary due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Her win, how­ever, had as much to do with former world No. 1 Ko’s dra­matic late col­lapse. The Kiwi, poised to end two years and 44 tour­na­ments without a victory, looked to be cruis­ing af­ter open­ing up a five-shot lead with six holes to play at High­land Mead­ows.</p>
    <p>But the 23-year-old en­dured a night­mare fin­ish down the stretch that in­cluded bo­geys on the 14th and 16th be­fore a dis­as­trous dou­ble-bo­gey seven on the 18th.</p>
    <p>Kang sensed blood once she saw Ko stum­ble.</p>
    <p>“My cad­die looked at me and said, ‘You’re right in it,’” the 27-year-old</p>
    <p>Kang said af­ter­wards. “I looked at him and said, ‘I’m five down with six holes to go.’ I kind of liked that men­tal­ity, made some good birdies com­ing in and kept it to­gether.”</p>
    <p>The LPGA Tour now heads to Bri­tain for the Ladies Scot­tish Open, which starts on Thurs­day, and Kang has set her sights on win­ning her sec­ond Ma­jor af­ter the 2017 Women’s PGA Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been play­ing re­ally great con­sis­tently be­fore and af­ter quar­an­tine,” the five-time Tour win­ner said. “A big part of how I’ve ap­proached the golf game is I’m re­ally not fo­cused on a lot of other things other than just get­ting bet­ter at things I want to get bet­ter at.</p>
    <p>“We al­ways have room to im­prove. That’s the beauty of golf.”</p>
    <p>For Ko, who is now ranked 55th, the wait goes on.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s God’s way of telling me it wasn’t my day,” she said wist­fully. “When you look back, you’re like, ‘Maybe I should have done this, maybe I should have done that.’ But, what can you do?”</p>
    <p>Else­where, na­tive Cal­i­for­nian Rose Zhang won the long­est US Women’s Am­a­teur ti­tle match in 54 years, end­ing Gabriela Ruf­fels’ bid to be­come the cham­pi­onship’s first re­peat win­ner since Kang in 2011.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian missed from three feet, watch­ing as her par putt lip out of the 38th hole on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther player led by more than two-up through­out the 36-hole match, which meant the event had to go to ex­tra holes for the first time since 2001.</p>
