    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United main­tained their 100 per cent away record i n the Pre­mier League af­ter a 3-2 win at base­ment club Sh­effield United on Thurs­day but their poor home form con­tin­ues to con­cern Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer.</p>
    <p>The Red Devils have won all six league games on the road and have col­lected more points on their trav­els than at Old Traf­ford, where their only vic­tory was against 19th-placed West Bromwich Al­bion last month.</p>
    <p>If his side are to mount a se­ri­ous ti­tle challenge, they must turn the Theatre of Dreams into a fortress, Sol­sk­jaer in­sisted.</p>
    <p>Speaking af­ter a dou­ble by Mar­cus Rash­ford and An­thony Mar­tial’s first Pre­mier League strike of the cam­paign over­came David Mc­Goldrick’s brace, the United man­ager said: “We need to sort out the home form.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, it’s not like it’s home and away in th­ese con­di­tions with­out fans and it seems like we’re go­ing to be in this sit­u­a­tion a lit­tle</p>
    <p>longer, but we should be more used to the Old Traf­ford pitch than th­ese pitches.”</p>
    <p>But Sol­sk­jaer be­lieves their per­for­mance at Bra­mall Lane bodes well for to­mor­row, when United host Leeds, as long as they do not ease off.</p>
    <p>“We played some bril­liant foot­ball be­tween their first goal and their sec­ond goal – the end was a bit too un­com­fort­able for my lik­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Asked whether his play­ers feel they can yet win the ti­tle for the first time since 2012-13 as clearcut favourites have yet to emerge, Sol­sk­jaer added: “We can’t get our heads too far ahead, but I am happy the play­ers might be think­ing that way be­cause that means re­cov­ery, fo­cus is bet­ter and those lit­tle mar­gins mean a lot.”</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian also de­fended striker Edin­son Ca­vani, who was charged with an ag­gra­vated breach of the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion’s rules for us­ing a racial term in an In­sta­gram post.</p>
    <p>The Uruguayan, who faces a three-game sus­pen­sion, did not play against the Blades due to in­jury.</p>
    <p>But Sol­sk­jaer protested his in­no­cence, say­ing: “I know that Edin­son never meant any harm, it’s his friend he was re­ply­ing to. He has come into a new coun­try and made a mis­take and he’s apol­o­gised. He didn’t mean any mal­ice, so we’ll work with the FA and hope­fully, he’ll be okay.”</p>
    <p>United are sixth on 23 points and trail lead­ers Liver­pool by five points but have played a game fewer.</p>
