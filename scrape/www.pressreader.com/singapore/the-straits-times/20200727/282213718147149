    <p>One thing I dis­cov­ered dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker was how much help my son, who is in Se­condary 3, needed to catch up in his school work.</p>
    <p>I had known he was lag­ging be­hind his peers; I had re­ceived calls from his teach­ers telling me that he was inat­ten­tive and oc­ca­sion­ally dis­rup­tive in class, and had bro­ken mi­nor school rules.</p>
    <p>But it was only when we were put to­gether dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker that my hus­band and I re­alised we needed to do some­thing.</p>
    <p>I was thank­ful that dur­ing home-based learn­ing, par­ents were able to ac­cess the as­sign­ments and teach­ing ma­te­ri­als posted on­line.</p>
    <p>Although it was decades ago when we stud­ied some of the sub­jects, we were still able to help to a cer­tain ex­tent as tem­po­rary teach­ers at home.</p>
    <p>Now that my son is back in school, we are keep­ing an eye on his progress, but we no longer have as clear a picture.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, I re­mem­ber ex­press­ing my con­cern about the steep and stress­ful tran­si­tion from pri­mary school to se­condary school to his teach­ers when he was in Sec 1.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents are ex­pected to in­de­pen­dently keep up with a sub­stan­tial in­crease in work vol­ume, and I fear that this may af­fect their at­ti­tude to­wards learn­ing. Those who do not have help read­ily avail­able to them may give up, lose their at­tach­ment to school and run into is­sues such as delin­quency.</p>
    <p>My wish is for the se­condary school sys­tem to be kinder to young Sin­ga­pore­ans and make school life a bit more man­age­able for them.</p>
    <p>I sug­gest that Sec 1 stu­dents start with six sub­jects, which is al­ready an in­crease from the four sub­jects in Pri­mary 6. The num­ber of sub­jects can then in­crease from</p>
    <p>Sec 2.</p>
    <p>A blend of home-based learn­ing and class­room learn­ing should also be used from the start of Sec 1. Stu­dents should have easy ac­cess to on­line notes and as­sign­ments af­ter class, and not have to worry about copy­ing notes dur­ing class, which may hurt their abil­ity to un­der­stand and keep up.</p>
    <p>Class­room lessons should fo­cus on get­ting stu­dents to un­der­stand con­cepts. Kang Soh Teng</p>
