    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land will ex­tend a state of emer­gency through next month as the tourism-de­pen­dent na­tion gears up for the re­open­ing of bor­ders to for­eign vis­i­tors af­ter a six-month gap, while main­tain­ing its rel­a­tive suc­cess in con­tain­ing lo­cal trans­mis­sion of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The na­tional Covid-19 task force chaired by Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha yes­ter­day ap­proved the ex­ten­sion of emer­gency rules through Oct 31, ac­cord­ing to Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Wis­sanu KreaNgam. The panel also ap­proved special tourist visas for for­eign tourists start­ing next month, Tourism and Sports Min­is­ter Phiphat Ratchak­it­prakarn said in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>The one-month ex­ten­sion, when ap­proved by the Cab­i­net to­day, would be the sixth since the ini­tial or­der in March. The emer­gency rules al­low the gov­ern­ment to en­force manda­tory quar­an­tines and stream­line disease-con­trol plans with­out mul­ti­ple ap­provals from var­i­ous agen­cies. The mea­sures were set to end to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Thai­land has man­aged to con­trol the coro­n­avirus out­break quickly, and was able to grad­u­ally restart most parts of its econ­omy since May. It has so far re­ported just over 3,500 cases and 59 deaths, and the ma­jor­ity of its re­cent cases were found in state quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>But its econ­omy, which is also re­liant on man­u­fac­tur­ing, is on track for its worst con­trac­tion on record as the pan­demic has dis­rupted in­ter­na­tional trade and travel.</p>
    <p>The first lot of for­eign tourists – 150 Chi­nese nationals – will ar­rive in Phuket in a char­ter flight from Guangzhou on Oct 8, Mr Phiphat said. They will be fol­lowed by an­other Chi­nese group on Oct 25 and the first Euro­pean vis­i­tors in early Novem­ber, he said.</p>
    <p>“Many peo­ple want to come to Thai­land be­cause we can con­trol the out­break well,” Mr Prayut said. “We have to re­open so the econ­omy can go for­ward. If we don’t do any­thing, it’ll be bad all around.”</p>
