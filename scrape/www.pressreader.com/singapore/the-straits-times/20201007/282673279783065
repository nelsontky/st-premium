    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Amer­i­can ac­tor Alec Bald­win has de­fended his im­per­son­ation (left) of Mr Don­ald Trump on tele­vi­sion’s Satur­day Night Live (SNL) sketch show while the United States Pres­i­dent was hos­pi­talised with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In an In­sta­gram video in re­sponse to crit­i­cism on so­cial me­dia, Bald­win said he would not have done so had Mr Trump been “truly, gravely ill”.</p>
    <p>The 62-year-old ac­tor said the pro­duc­ers and the NBC net­work “don’t want to sink the ship. So if there was ever the sug­ges­tion that Trump was truly, gravely ill... re­ally in trou­ble, then I would bet you ev­ery­thing I have that we wouldn’t even get near that in terms of the con­tent of the show”.</p>
    <p>SNL was broad­cast from New York the day af­ter Mr Trump was ad­mit­ted to t he hos­pi­tal with coro­n­avirus symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The sever­ity of his ill­ness is un­clear af­ter con­flict­ing re­ports from doc­tors and US of­fi­cials. Mr Trump re­turned to the White House on Mon­day night af­ter be­ing treated for three days at the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The TV show opened with a sketch mak­ing fun of last Tues­day’s rau­cous pres­i­den­tial de­bate be­tween Mr Trump and Demo­cratic con­tender Joe Bi­den, played by ac­tor Jim Car­rey, that took place be­fore Mr Trump tested pos­i­tive for the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>“Did you take the Covid test you promised to take in advance?” asked ac­tor Beck Ben­nett, who played de­bate mod­er­a­tor Chris Wal­lace of Fox News.</p>
    <p>“Ab­so­lutely, scout’s hon­our,” said Bald­win’s Mr Trump with his fin­gers crossed. “The China virus is a hoax – and that will prob­a­bly come back to haunt me later this week.”</p>
    <p>Bald­win, who won an Emmy in 2017 for play­ing Mr Trump, dis­missed “the per­cep­tion that we’re mock­ing him while he’s sick”.</p>
    <p>“We only have the words of the White House it­self and the peo­ple who work there them­selves to go on, and all of them have been say­ing that he is not in any dan­ger,” Bald­win said in his post­ing.</p>
    <p>Later in last Satur­day’s show, co­me­dian Chris Rock quipped: “Pres­i­dent Trump is in the hos­pi­tal due to Covid, and my heart goes out to Covid.”</p>
    <p>NBC did not re­turn a re­quest for com­ment on Mon­day on Bald­win’s re­marks or the con­tent of the SNL broad­cast.</p>
