    <p>Tot­ten­ham man­ager Jose Mour­inho took aim at Jur­gen Klopp af­ter his team’s 2-1 Premier League away de­feat by Liver­pool on Wed­nes­day and even found time to re­open his old feud with Pep Guardi­ola.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Son He­ung-min can­celled out Mo­hamed Salah’s opener in the first half, a 90th-minute header from Roberto Firmino sent the hosts three points clear of Spurs (25) at the top of the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>It was hard to take for Mour­inho, whose team were not only mo­ments away from a hard-earned draw but could have won the game with Steven Berg­wijn hit­ting the post and Harry Kane miss­ing a great chance at An­field.</p>
    <p>Asked about what ap­peared to be a testy ex­change with Klopp af­ter the fi­nal whis­tle, Mour­inho told Ama­zon Prime: “I told him the best team lost. He dis­agreed. That’s his opin­ion.</p>
    <p>“By the way, if I be­haved the way on the touch­line like he does, I have no chance to stay there – and I’m out af­ter a minute.”</p>
    <p>When a re­porter ques­tioned whether he was re­fer­ring to Klopp’s over-ex­u­ber­ant re­ac­tions on the side­lines, Mour­inho said: “That’s an­i­mated? That’s an­i­mated? Or do you want me to take the screen (from) the fourth of­fi­cial’s hands?”</p>
    <p>The Por­tuguese was ref­er­enc­ing Manch­ester City man­ager Guardi­ola’s re­sponse to the amount of added time shown at the end of his team’s 1-1 draw with West Bromwich Al­bion on Tues­day by grab­bing the fourth of­fi­cial’s elec­tronic board. Claim­ing there are dou­ble stan­dards, he added: “For some rea­son, I am dif­fer­ent. And that’s that.”</p>
    <p>On Klopp, Mour­inho later told the BBC: “Ev­ery­thing is fine be­tween us. The ref­er­ees let him be­have the way he does. It’s not my prob­lem. I feel sad for it be­cause I can­not do it but it’s just the way it is.”</p>
    <p>Klopp ap­peared non­plussed when asked about his ar­gu­ment with Mour­inho at full-time.</p>
    <p>“It was not heated at all,” he told the BBC. “He wasn’t happy be­cause he told me the bet­ter team lost – and I thought he was jok­ing. But he wasn’t. So that’s it.”</p>
    <p>But while the hosts sealed a vi­tal win, the Ger­man saw enough from the vis­i­tors to de­clare they were ti­tle chal­lengers and not just chas­ing for a Cham­pi­ons League spot.</p>
    <p>Spurs have not won the league since 1960-61 but Klopp said: “They will be top of the ta­ble un­til the end of the sea­son be­cause they are re­ally good. But to play against them is a proper chal­lenge and to play like us, is pretty spe­cial.</p>
    <p>“Of course, Tot­ten­ham had chances, I know that they scored a goal and an un­be­liev­ably tight off­side de­ci­sion – we are re­ally not lucky with these mo­ments in the mo­ment. They had other chances.</p>
    <p>“But around these mo­ments, we were com­pletely in charge of the game, which is im­por­tant, stay con­cen­trated, pro­tected our at­tacks sen­sa­tion­ally well, counter-press was good, pass­ing was good.”</p>
    <p>Spurs host an­other top-four ri­val in Le­ices­ter on Sun­day and Mour­inho urged his play­ers to learn from this bit­ter loss so as to “kill matches of this di­men­sion”.</p>
    <p>“I think the first thing that makes ti­tle con­tenders is to go to ev­ery match to win it, with that am­bi­tion,” he said. “I prom­ise you that the am­bi­tion is there... We had it, knew how to hurt and should do much more than we did.”</p>
    <p>NOT FOR ME</p>
    <p>By the way, if I be­haved the way on the touch­line like he does, I have no chance to stay there – and I’m out af­ter a minute.</p>
    <p>JOSE MOUR­INHO, Spurs man­ager, who feels other coaches are let off more eas­ily for their be­hav­iour.</p>
