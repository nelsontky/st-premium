    <p>If ever Ms Ka­mala Har­ris gains the vice-pres­i­dency of the United</p>
    <p>States and makes a trip to Sin­ga­pore there­after, the lead­er­ship here should have lit­tle dif­fi­culty plan­ning a meal at a pub­lic venue, as it some­times likes to do: A tho­sai at Madras New Wood­lands in Up­per Dick­son Road would make for great vi­su­als. Equally, a steak din­ner at Mor­ton’s will do just fine.</p>
    <p>These are the worlds strad­dled by Ms Har­ris, the ju­nior sen­a­tor from Cal­i­for­nia and former at­tor­ney­gen­eral of Amer­ica’s rich­est state who is the child of a Ja­maican-born fa­ther and a Tamil In­dian mother, both US im­mi­grants.</p>
    <p>“My mother in­stilled in my sis­ter, Maya, and me the val­ues that would chart the course of our lives. She raised us to be proud, strong black women. And she raised us to know and be proud of our In­dian her­itage,” Ms Har­ris said in her ac­cep­tance speech, after her nom­i­na­tion to be Mr Joseph Bi­den’s run­ning mate for the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion was en­dorsed by the Demo­cratic Party.</p>
    <p>Golf le­gend Tiger Woods rarely makes a big deal of his Asian her­itage – his mother is Thai – choos­ing to stay mostly within the African-Amer­i­can iden­tity in­her­ited from his fa­ther but Ms Har­ris, now just as fa­mous, puts her Asian-ness to good use. Tal­ented as she is in her own cho­sen trade</p>
    <p>– law – she didn’t win two elec­tions to state at­tor­ney-gen­eral and sub­se­quently, the Se­nate, by shy­ing away from clever mes­sag­ing.</p>
    <p>The men­tion of her In­dian roots by Ms Har­ris, who went to black col­leges such as Howard Univer­sity in Wash­ing­ton, DC and chaired the Black Stu­dents So­ci­ety at Hast­ings</p>
    <p>Col­lege in Cal­i­for­nia, is de­lib­er­ate; Indians are the most pros­per­ous im­mi­grant com­mu­nity in the United States and, also, in­creas­ingly ac­tive in po­lit­i­cal life.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris surely knows too that many In­dian Amer­i­cans are tilt­ing to­wards Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, in part thanks to the as­sid­u­ous woo­ing of the Trump White House by the gov­ern­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi, who is pop­u­lar with over­seas Indians.</p>
    <p>Still, while there have been women can­di­dates for vi­cepres­i­dent be­fore her, Ms Har­ris’ pres­ence on the ticket adds a mea­sure of ex­cite­ment be­cause it is the first time a black woman, and one with half-Asian eth­nic­ity, has come so close to be­ing a heart­beat away from the Oval of­fice.</p>
    <p>How should Asia view the Har­ris phe­nom­e­non? De­pend­ing on where you sit, she raises mixed feel­ings.</p>
    <p>For one thing, it is a pos­i­tive that Cal­i­for­nia, where she was born and raised till the age of 12 – her par­ents were re­searchers at Berke­ley – is a Pa­cific-fronting state with close con­nec­tions to Asia.</p>
    <p>Although this did not stop her from op­pos­ing the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship agree­ment, a tip of the hat to the Amer­ica First con­stituency gal­vanised by Mr Trump per­haps, it helps that her state, home to Sil­i­con Val­ley, is known for an out­ward-ori­ented, pro­gres­sive cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia is also no­table for its di­ver­sity; in that re­spect, it nudges out even Texas and Hawaii, other US states that too have very mixed pop­u­la­tions. In­deed, San Fran­cisco’s Chi­na­town, al­most as big as the one in Queens, New York, is the coun­try’s old­est, hark­ing back to the days of the Cal­i­for­nia Gold Rush in the mid-19th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Her own per­sona em­braces not only mul­tira­cial­ism but mul­ti­cul­tur­al­ism as well. She was, for in­stance, raised to wor­ship at both a black church and a Hindu tem­ple – val­ues that sit well with most Asian so­ci­eties, es­pe­cially those that set store by re­li­gious har­mony and sec­u­lar val­ues.</p>
    <p>The en­vi­ron­ment in which she was raised would sug­gest she would carry an abid­ing re­spect for tal­ent and in­tel­lect. Her growth, after all, was within the grooves of academe, both in San Fran­cisco and in Mon­treal, Canada, where her mother moved with her two girls fol­low­ing her di­vorce.</p>
    <p>These in­flu­ences would no doubt shape Ms Har­ris’ think­ing about the fu­ture of an Amer­ica that’s be­ing pushed into a crude de­cou­pling from Asia’s dom­i­nant eco­nomic and mil­i­tary power, right to the level of univer­sity ad­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>NU­ANCED VIEWS</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing that there must have been some in­tense dis­cus­sions with Mr Bi­den be­fore she joined his ticket, it is a fair guess that she would have signed on to the lat­ter’s more so­phis­ti­cated view of the strate­gic con­test with China, if she did not have an even more nu­anced view her­self.</p>
    <p>Although her forte is do­mes­tic is­sues such as law en­force­ment against the vast for­eign policy ex­per­tise of Mr Bi­den, he will most likely be seen as a lame duck from early in the pres­i­dency, should he suc­ceed at all.</p>
    <p>That’s be­cause he would be 78 years old when he takes of­fice and un­likely to seek a sec­ond term. That would lend Ms Har­ris an im­por­tance, and in­flu­ence, that vice-pres­i­dents typ­i­cally do not have.</p>
    <p>For these rea­sons, China’s power elite would prob­a­bly wel­come a Bi­den-Har­ris rise, even if the aver­age Chi­nese per­son on the street may have a more am­biva­lent view.</p>
    <p>It gets more com­pli­cated with Ja­pan, and In­dia, land of her mother’s birth, where the re­verse seems to be the case.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic opin­ion polls con­ducted by Gallup, Yomi­uri Shim­bun,</p>
    <p>Nikkei and NHK have con­sis­tently shown that most Ja­panese would not like to see Mr Trump re-elected. How­ever, Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe and his rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party are heav­ily in­vested in Mr Trump, partly be­cause of strate­gic con­sid­er­a­tions vis-a-vis China and North Korea.</p>
    <p>An ar­ti­cle in the April 10 is­sue of The Amer­i­can In­ter­est, by a</p>
    <p>Ja­panese gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial who signed off as “YA”, cat­e­gor­i­cally stated that “we just don’t want to see the United States go back again to en­gage­ment (with China), which will un­doubt­edly come at our, and other Asian coun­tries’ ex­pense”.</p>
    <p>Like Tokyo, New Delhi too has grown to be­ing more com­fort­able with Repub­li­can ad­min­is­tra­tions, see­ing them as less ide­o­log­i­cal on is­sues like hu­man rights, com­pared with Democrats.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, Mr Modi even risked mas­sive com­mu­nity spread­ing of the coro­n­avirus in his anx­i­ety to en­sure a mil­lion-strong turnout for the pub­lic re­cep­tion he ac­corded the vis­it­ing Mr Trump in his home state.</p>
    <p>Ka­mala, in San­skrit, trans­lates as lo­tus, which is the sym­bol of the rul­ing Bharatiya Janata Party. Or­di­nar­ily, the party’s Hindu na­tion­al­ist ide­o­logues should have cel­e­brated her prospec­tive rise as another sym­bol of global Hindu resur­gence. How­ever, the Modi gov­ern­ment is markedly wary about Ms Har­ris, par­tic­u­larly her scep­ti­cism about New Delhi’s Kash­mir policy.</p>
    <p>So, even as mil­lions of Indians, par­tic­u­larly in the south­ern states, rap­tur­ously em­brace Ms Har­ris as their own, there has been a mount­ing so­cial me­dia cam­paign within In­dian-Amer­i­can groups sug­gest­ing that both Ms Har­ris and Mr Bi­den are “bad news for In­dia”. Some trolls even de­scribe Ms Har­ris as a “Pak­istani”.</p>
    <p>TOUGH CAM­PAIGNER</p>
    <p>To be sure, the Bi­den-Har­ris ticket is by no means a shoo-in on Nov 3. De­spite trail­ing by more than 7 per­cent­age points in pop­u­lar­ity rank­ings cur­rently, Mr Trump is a for­mi­da­ble chal­lenger, with a knack for coin­ing jibes that tend to stick in peo­ple’s minds –</p>
    <p>“Crooked Hil­lary” for Mrs Clin­ton and “Sleepy Joe” for the near-sep­tu­a­ge­nar­ian Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>He has de­scribed Ms Har­ris as “very, very nasty”.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal for­tunes can turn. Even as Europe bat­tles a surge in coro­n­avirus cases, US cases are sta­bil­is­ing and may even start eas­ing by Elec­tion Day, help­ing Mr Trump claim suc­cess in han­dling the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>And if the Bi­den-Har­ris pair do make it this year, there is still no guar­an­tee that Ms Har­ris’ po­lit­i­cal ca­reer will ad­vance fur­ther, un­less Mr Bi­den’s ten­ure should be cut short for any rea­son and she suc­ceeds him in the pres­i­dency. Surely, there are pow­er­ful fig­ures in her own party – the charis­matic New York Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo, for in­stance, who are prob­a­bly eye­ing their na­tional chances for the 2024 nom­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>If she sur­mounts that ob­sta­cle, the task would still be a huge one; in 1960, then-vice pres­i­dent Richard Nixon lost the pop­u­lar vote nar­rowly to the young sen­a­tor from Mas­sachusetts,</p>
    <p>John F. Kennedy, who swept the Elec­toral Col­lege.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, every­one knows that the pop­u­lar vote it­self is not enough to win the pres­i­dency. Mrs Clin­ton did take it in the last elec­tion, as did party mate Al Gore against Mr Ge­orge W. Bush ear­lier, but both were thwarted by the Elec­toral Col­lege sys­tem.</p>
    <p>There’s also no say­ing that if an Amer­ica that was not ready to make Mrs Clin­ton the first woman pres­i­dent in 2016 would be more amenable to elect another woman, and a black woman at that, in 2024.</p>
    <p>That said, Ms Har­ris’ star could well be on the as­cen­dant.</p>
    <p>A can­di­date’s se­lec­tion is based not merely on qual­i­fi­ca­tions but more im­por­tantly, electabil­ity.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris’ role is to bring in the black voter – tra­di­tion­ally less en­thu­si­as­tic about turn­ing up to vote – as well as women and mil­len­ni­als.</p>
    <p>De­spite her ob­vi­ous qual­i­fi­ca­tions as the highly ed­u­cated former US sec­re­tary of state, sen­a­tor and first lady,</p>
    <p>Mrs Clin­ton lost the 2016 race to Mr Trump partly be­cause of Demo­cratic voter fa­tigue after eight years of Obama rule, mil­len­ni­als look­ing to third-party can­di­dates and many His­pan­ics fail­ing to show up to vote.</p>
    <p>But to­day, amid steep un­em­ploy­ment and a rag­ing pan­demic, Amer­i­cans have good rea­sons to think that things could not be worse. Older white Amer­i­cans, many of whom voted for Mr Trump, are among the peo­ple most af­fected by the coro­n­avirus. That may leave them more open to try­ing a change, leav­ing just enough of an open­ing for Mr Bi­den and Ms Har­ris to squeeze through.</p>
