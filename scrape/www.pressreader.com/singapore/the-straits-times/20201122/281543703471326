    <p>As a num­ber of Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates un­dergo late-stage tri­als, the lead­ers of the Group of 20 (G-20) economies yes­ter­day un­der­scored the im­por­tance of en­sur­ing eq­ui­table and af­ford­able ac­cess to vac­cines for the world to re­cover from the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said this is some­thing coun­tries should work to­gether to en­sure. He pledged Sin­ga­pore’s sup­port for ef­forts to en­sure that the dis­tri­bu­tion of new vac­cines is shared fairly.</p>
    <p>He also called on world lead­ers to strengthen the global dis­ease sur­veil­lance net­works so that the world will be bet­ter pre­pared to de­tect, con­trol and over­come the next pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The first day of the Riyadh summit, held vir­tu­ally, saw G-20 lead­ers and guests dis­cuss the coron­avirus. They are ex­pected to dis­cuss plans for eco­nomic re­cov­ery to­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore stands ready to sup­port the G-20 in its en­deav­ours to rein­vig­o­rate mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism – and to cre­ate a fair, pre­dictable and sta­ble in­ter­na­tional or­der, which will al­low ev­ery coun­try, big and small, to grow and pros­per.</p>
    <p>With the Covid-19 pan­demic dom­i­nat­ing the agenda on the first day of the Group of 20 (G-20) Riyadh summit yes­ter­day, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong called on world lead­ers to work to­gether to en­sure the eq­ui­table dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines, and to boost sur­veil­lance net­works for diseases.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the first ses­sion of the two-day meet­ing, held vir­tu­ally ow­ing to travel re­stric­tions, PM Lee told G-20 lead­ers that the group is well placed to co­or­di­nate and drive the global re­sponse re­quired to tackle the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>He said the Saudi pres­i­dency had gal­vanised in­ter­na­tional ac­tion by co­or­di­nat­ing fis­cal re­sources, pri­or­i­ties and poli­cies on a global level, by sup­port­ing the most vul­ner­a­ble coun­tries and by com­plet­ing a G-20 ac­tion plan for a strong and sus­tain­able eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore fully sup­ports th­ese ef­forts, said PM Lee, who put for­ward two sug­ges­tions on what more G-20 coun­tries could do to­gether.</p>
    <p>The first is to en­sure af­ford­able and eq­ui­table ac­cess to vac­cines – a point also made by other lead­ers, in­clud­ing Saudi Ara­bia’s King Sal­man bin Ab­du­laziz Al Saud, who chaired the meet­ing.</p>
    <p>The scale of the pan­demic led to a scram­ble for med­i­cal sup­plies ear­lier this year, with some coun­tries lim­it­ing ex­ports, and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has warned about a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion with “vac­cine na­tion­al­ism”.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said he was glad the G-20 had ad­vanced vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism by back­ing global ini­tia­tives such as the Ac­cess to Covid-19 Tools Ac­cel­er­a­tor and the Covid-19 Vac­cine Global Ac­cess (Co­vax) Fa­cil­ity, which were set up to en­sure that the dis­tri­bu­tion of any new vac­cines would be shared equally.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is a co-chair of the Friends of the Co­vax Fa­cil­ity, and will do its part in con­tribut­ing to the Co­vax Ad­vance Mar­ket Com­mit­ment, which helps fund vac</p>

    <p>cines for lower-in­come coun­tries, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic will also con­tinue to work closely with the WHO and Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions to ac­cel­er­ate vac­cine devel­op­ment and en­hance long-term pan­demic pre­pared­ness, he added.</p>
    <p>The se­cond sug­ges­tion PM Lee made was to strengthen global dis­ease sur­veil­lance net­works so that the world will be bet­ter pre­pared for the next pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has wreaked havoc on the whole world. But the next pan­demic – Dis­ease X – may be more con­ta­gious and far dead­lier.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee said the ef­fec­tive­ness of such net­works de­pends on coun­tries in­vest­ing in their do­mes­tic sur­veil­lance and re­sponse ca­pa­bil­i­ties, and on their will­ing­ness to share in­for­ma­tion with one an­other.</p>
    <p>He also hoped that all coun­tries would em­brace mul­ti­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion un­der the lead­er­ship of the WHO.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has re­in­forced the need for coun­tries to work to­gether. Ul­ti­mately, no coun­try is safe un­til ev­ery coun­try is safe,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore stands ready to sup­port the G-20 in its en­deav­ours to rein­vig­o­rate mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism – and to cre­ate a fair, pre­dictable and sta­ble in­ter­na­tional or­der, which will al­low ev­ery coun­try, big and small, to grow and pros­per.”</p>
    <p>The G-20 com­prises 19 large ad­vanced and emerg­ing economies and the Euro­pean Union, and was con­vened by the United States to co­or­di­nate a global re­sponse to the 2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has been in­vited to this year’s G-20 meet­ings as a guest.</p>
    <p>It is also con­vener of the Global Gover­nance Group – an in­for­mal coali­tion of 30 coun­tries that seeks to in­flu­ence the G-20 to take into ac­count the in­ter­ests of smaller coun­tries af­fected by its de­ci­sions.</p>
