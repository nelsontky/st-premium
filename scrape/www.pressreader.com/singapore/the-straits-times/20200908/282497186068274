    <p>In­flu­en­tial Czech di­rec­tor Jiri Men­zel (left), whose 1966 movie, Closely Watched Trains, won the Academy Award for Best For­eign Lan­guage Film, has died at age 82, his wife Olga Men­zelova said on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Men­zel was part of the Czech New Wave of film-mak­ers of the 1960s that in­cluded One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984) di­rec­tor Mi­los For­man and avant-garde di­rec­tor Vera Chytilova.</p>
    <p>Men­zel strug­gled with se­ri­ous health prob­lems and rarely ap­peared in pub­lic af­ter brain surgery in 2017. Men­zel’s wife said he died at home last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Men­zel gained fame for Closely Watched Trains, the com­ing-of-age story of a young train dis­patcher in Ger­man-oc­cu­pied Czecho­slo­va­kia dur­ing World War II.</p>
    <p>It was based on a novel by Czech writer Bo­hu­mil Hra­bal, whose works were a source of other Men­zel films, in­clud­ing I Served The King Of Eng­land in 2006.</p>
    <p>“I had more luck than rea­son,” he said in 2016, re­call­ing his Os­car­win­ning movie. “More than all the prizes and medals I re­ceived for this movie, I val­ued the life­long friend­ship with Hra­bal.”</p>
    <p>Like other di­rec­tors of his gen­er­a­tion, Men­zel faced prob­lems with the com­mu­nist author­i­ties.</p>
    <p>His 1969 film, Larks On A String, de­pict­ing a group of po­lit­i­cally per­se­cuted peo­ple forced to work in a scrap­yard, was not shown in his home coun­try un­til 1990.</p>
    <p>It went on to win the Golden Bear at the Ber­lin In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val in 1990.</p>
    <p>Men­zel ex­celled in bit­ter­sweet de­pic­tions of life, with doses of hu­mour and nos­tal­gia. Many of his works are revered among Czech au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>His 1985 film, My Sweet Lit­tle Vil­lage, was nom­i­nated for an Os­car. A num­ber of his other movies have be­come clas­sics for Czech film watch­ers and di­rec­tors.</p>
    <p>Men­zel also acted in dozens of movies and plays. A bach­e­lor late into life, he and Men­zelova, a film pro­ducer, mar­ried in 2004.</p>
