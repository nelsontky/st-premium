    <p>HONG KONG A Chi­nese court yes­ter­day jailed 10 Hong Kong democ­racy ac­tivists for up to three years over a bid to flee the city by speed­boat to Tai­wan, as a crack­down on dis­sent in the ter­ri­tory in­ten­si­fies.</p>
    <p>The group was ar­rested by the Chi­nese coast guard on Aug 23 en route to the self-ruled is­land, which has qui­etly opened its doors to Hong Kongers seek­ing sanc­tu­ary.</p>
    <p>The court i n Shen­zhen sen­tenced Tang Kai Yin to three years in jail and Quinn Moon to two years for or­gan­is­ing an il­le­gal bor­der cross­ing.</p>
    <p>The eight oth­ers re­ceived seven months be­hind bars for il­le­gally cross­ing the bor­der.</p>
    <p>They were also fined up to 20,000 yuan (S$4,000) in ad­di­tion to their jail terms.</p>
    <p>The sen­tenc­ing fol­lows this year’s im­po­si­tion of a new se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong that gives the govern­ment broad pow­ers to prose­cute po­lit­i­cal dis­si­dents.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of ac­tivists have fled over­seas and po­lit­i­cal or­gan­i­sa­tions have shut­tered their doors as Bei­jing seeks to keep a lid on un­rest that rocked the fi­nan­cial hub for months last year.</p>
    <p>Twelve peo­ple were caught on the boat. The group were fac­ing pros­e­cu­tion in Hong Kong linked to last year’s protests be­fore try­ing to es­cape. They are likely to face fur­ther charges in the city after serv­ing their main­land sen­tences.</p>
    <p>Two mi­nors from the group, aged 17 and 18, were re­turned to the city yes­ter­day after they ad­mit­ted to wrong­do­ing, Chi­nese of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The pair face charges of con­spir­acy to com­mit ar­son and pos­ses­sion of an of­fen­sive weapon and have been re­manded in cus­tody.</p>
    <p>The Yan­tian District Peo­ple’s Procu­ra­torate said it would not pur­sue its case against t he t wo teenagers.</p>
    <p>Lawyers of the 10 adult ac­tivists yes­ter­day said the sen­tences were too heavy and the al­le­ga­tion of or­gan­is­ing a bor­der cross­ing was not sub­stan­ti­ated.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to main­land me­dia, Tang bought the boat in Au­gust and learnt ba­sic driv­ing skills for the es­cape, while Quinn Moon was re­spon­si­ble for com­mu­ni­cat­ing with the rest of the group, urg­ing them to tell the coast guard they were go­ing fish­ing if caught.</p>
    <p>They all pleaded guilty to the crime and signed con­fes­sion pa­pers in the pres­ence of lawyers, Guang­dong’s South­ern Daily re­ported.</p>
    <p>The United States on Mon­day called for the im­me­di­ate re­lease of the group, say­ing they were “flee­ing tyranny”.</p>
    <p>“Com­mu­nist China will stop at noth­ing to pre­vent its peo­ple from seek­ing free­dom else­where,” a US em­bassy spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Amnesty In­ter­na­tional said that the group were at risk of tor­ture while serv­ing sen­tences in main­land jails.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry on Mon­day pushed back against the crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>Spokesman Zhao Li­jian said Wash­ing­ton must “im­me­di­ately stop in­ter­fer­ing in China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs through the Hong Kong is­sue and im­me­di­ately stop in­ter­fer­ing in China’s ju­di­cial sovereignt­y”.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong gives the authoritie­s pow­ers of pros­e­cu­tion for acts con­sid­ered as ter­ror­ism, se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion or col­lu­sion with for­eign en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing says the law was needed to re­store peace and sta­bil­ity, but crit­ics have con­demned it as a fa­tal at­tack on Hong Kong’s free­doms.</p>
