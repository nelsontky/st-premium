    <p>It can be dif­fi­cult to stand out in a sea of home-based food busi­nesses. One way is to sell some­thing that other peo­ple are not.</p>
    <p>That is what piques my in­ter­est in Su Nougat. The busi­ness be­longs to Ms Fairli Poh, 29, whose day job is in a bank. In her free time, start­ing at 4am un­til her work day be­gins at 9am, she makes nougat.</p>
    <p>That is not usu­ally some­thing on any­body’s radar, but I urge you to try her wares. For one thing, they are not sickly sweet.</p>
    <p>In fact, my favourite flavour is Scal­lion ($6), the lone savoury op­tion. It is in­spired by Tai­wanese sand­wich bis­cuits with scal­lion nougat in the mid­dle.</p>
    <p>The nougat in those bis­cuits can be very stiff and will stick to your teeth, but Su’s is quite the op­po­site. It is soft and yield­ing, and stud­ded with scal­lions, al­monds, cashews and cran­ber­ries. Salt and but­ter come through as well, and the cubes are tossed with milk pow­der.</p>
    <p>Ms Poh says she is work­ing on salted duck egg and mala ver­sions, and I can­not wait.</p>
    <p>The other one I would get is the sea­sonal Sea Salt Hazel­nut Choco­late ($10, above), which is equal parts sweet and salty. The dark choco­late chips and co­coa pow­der sup­ply the choco­late vibe, the hazel­nuts re­mind me of that fa­mous spread, but the sea salt and Hi­malayan pink salt stop ev­ery­thing from be­ing too cloy­ing.</p>
    <p>I am less en­am­oured of the sea­sonal Rose Ly­chee and Chrysan­the­mum flavours. They sound ex­cel­lent on pa­per, but re­ally need to de­liver in the flavour depart­ment.
