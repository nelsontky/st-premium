    <p>The abrupt thwart­ing of bil­lion­aire Jack Ma’s Ant Group’s US$37 bil­lion (S$50.4 bil­lion) dual list­ing is a stark re­minder of the un­cer­tainty and pit­falls of plac­ing bets on Chi­nese firms, ob­servers say.</p>
    <p>Ms Ste­fanie Yuen Thio, joint man­ag­ing part­ner at TSMP Law Cor­po­ra­tion, was sur­prised by the tim­ing of the sus­pen­sion as laws are not made overnight.</p>
    <p>“This episode is an im­por­tant re­minder that even as we mar­vel at the as­cen­dancy of China as an eco­nomic and fi­nan­cial pow­er­house, a dif­fer­ent ap­proach to deal­ing with its au­thor­i­ties is needed. If even Jack Ma can be hob­bled like this, smaller players must pro­ceed with cau­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>China on late Tues­day suspended the ini­tial public of­fer­ing (IPO) in Shang­hai and Hong Kong by the Chi­nese home-grown fin­tech giant, just two days be­fore what was set to be the world’s largest-ever stock mar­ket de­but.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, re­tired Sin­ga­pore diplo­mat Bi­la­hari Kausikan noted that the move by Bei­jing is a re­minder of who is in charge.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple for­get China is a communist coun­try. Not in its ide­ol­ogy, but in its po­lit­i­cal struc­ture. It is a Lenin­ist state run by a van­guard party that de­mands ab­so­lute con­trol. I un­der­stand the sus­pen­sion to be in ef­fect a can­cel­la­tion,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>But Kaiyuan Cap­i­tal’s chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer Brock Sil­vers be­lieves the sus­pen­sion, though a tremen­dous shock to the mar­ket, will not be a per­ma­nent set­back.</p>
    <p>“Ant’s IPO was also a bea­con for fur­ther cor­po­rate repa­tri­a­tions, one which Bei­jing will not want to dis­cour­age.”</p>
    <p>That said, Mr Sil­vers noted that the group still faces pos­si­ble fall­out in the cur­rent Sino-US tech en­vi­ron­ment and raised doubts as to whether sen­ti­ment will fully re­cover even as the IPO may pro­ceed.</p>
    <p>Ad­junct As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor James Cheng of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School noted that the reg­u­la­tory is­sues have been around from the get-go. “At the core, it is an is­sue of how the en­tire fi­nan­cial sec­tor’s profit mar­gin and risk are dis­trib­uted among the players.”</p>
    <p>He added that this is a good re­minder for in­vestors to be more multi-faceted in as­sess­ing firms’ busi­ness mod­els, es­pe­cially in emerg­ing mar­kets where reg­u­la­tions and po­lit­i­cal regimes are evolv­ing as their economies de­velop.</p>
    <p>The block­buster IPO was suspended in Shang­hai and Hong Kong after four reg­u­la­tory agen­cies sum­moned Mr Ma and the com­pany’s top two ex­ec­u­tives to a closed-door meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese me­dia re­ported that there have been more public dis­cus­sions in China re­cently over is­sues caused by large tech firms mov­ing into the fi­nan­cial space, es­pe­cially over fair com­pe­ti­tion and data pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>Some re­ports pointed to Mr Ma’s re­cent speech ques­tion­ing the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s out­dated ap­proach to reg­u­la­tion as rea­son for the de­rail­ment.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese reg­u­la­tors have ques­tioned Ant’s self-dis­tri­bu­tion of shares in re­cent weeks, said Mr Sil­vers, who added that “Ma’s com­ments were a re­sult of that process, not a cause”.</p>
    <p>Still, to be “a cred­i­ble and re­li­able in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial cen­tre, you need con­sis­tency and trans­parency in the ap­pli­ca­tion of your laws”, said Ms Yuen Thio.</p>
    <p>The dual list­ing by Ant Group, a fi­nan­cial-ser­vices com­po­nent carved out of Mr Ma’s Alibaba em­pire, was to be the world’s big­gest IPO, sur­pass­ing the US$25 bil­lion raised in 2014 by Alibaba Group Hold­ing and the US$29.4 bil­lion raised last De­cem­ber by Saudi Aramco.</p>
    <p>Just days be­fore the planned launch, the stock sale – priced at 68.8 yuan (S$14) each in Shang­hai and HK$80 (S$14) in Hong Kong – was heav­ily over­sub­scribed by in­sti­tu­tional and re­tail in­vestors, who placed or­ders worth US$3 tril­lion.</p>
    <p>In a fil­ing to the Hong Kong bourse, Ant said re­tail in­vestors will get their money back to­gether with the other bro­ker­ages and levies, at no in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>China’s na­tional pen­sion fund, and China state-owned fund man­agers, in­sur­ers and len­ders have a stake in the list­ing, while for­eign in­vestors in­clude Sin­ga­pore’s GIC and Te­masek Fuller­ton Al­pha, Canada Pen­sion Plan In­vest­ment Board and the Abu Dhabi In­vest­ment Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, Te­masek de­clined com­ment.</p>
    <p>Shares of Alibaba plunged by more than 7 per cent yes­ter­day, partly driv­ing down the Hang Seng In­dex to end 0.2 per cent, or 53.59 points, lower at 24,886.14.</p>
