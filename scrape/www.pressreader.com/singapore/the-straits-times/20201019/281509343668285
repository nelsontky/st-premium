    <p>A hos­tel along Ben­coolen Street has been or­dered to sus­pend op­er­a­tions for 30 days af­ter it was caught flout­ing Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board or­dered Hawaii Hos­tel to sus­pend op­er­a­tions from Oct 11 to Nov 9 af­ter in­ves­ti­ga­tions showed it had per­mit­ted over 260 guests to check in for leisure pur­poses since Sept 17.</p>
    <p>The sus­pen­sion is one of the tough­est penal­ties to date for a breach of safe man­age­ment mea­sures and the board re­minded hos­tel op­er­a­tors that “leisure book­ings are cur­rently not per­mit­ted”. It urged them to com­ply with all the mea­sures “to safe­guard the health and well-be­ing of our peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>In one of the tough­est penal­ties to date, a hos­tel has been or­dered to sus­pend op­er­a­tions for 30 days for flout­ing Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) or­dered Hawaii Hos­tel in Ben­coolen Street to sus­pend op­er­a­tions from Oct 11 to Nov 9 af­ter in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed the hos­tel had per­mit­ted more than 260 guests to check in for leisure pur­poses since Sept 17.</p>
    <p>“Hos­tel op­er­a­tors are re­minded that leisure book­ings are cur­rently not per­mit­ted. They should also com­ply with all safe man­age­ment mea­sures to safe­guard the health and well-be­ing of our peo­ple, and pre­vent new clus­ters from form­ing,” STB said.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, STB said its of­fi­cers also found that Hawaii Hos­tel pre­vi­ously made false state­ments to safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors, stat­ing its cus­tomers were long-term guests in­stead of guests on leisure book­ings. The hos­tel had also failed to record its guests’ pur­pose of stay.</p>
    <p>The hos­tel is not per­mit­ted to ac­cept new book­ings or ac­cept check-ins dur­ing its sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>As hos­tels are close-liv­ing quar­ters where non-re­lated in­di­vid­u­als are likely to come into close con­tact with one an­other in en­closed spa­ces and for pro­longed pe­ri­ods of time, there is a high risk of virus trans­mis­sion as­so­ci­ated with the phys­i­cal set­ting.</p>
    <p>STB’s reg­u­lar en­force­ment checks also found two es­tab­lish­ments con­duct­ing busi­ness de­spite not be­ing per­mit­ted to do so.</p>
    <p>On Oct 9, STB of­fi­cers found that 72 Mad Monk, a bar at Con­corde Shop­ping Cen­tre, was open de­spite not hav­ing a valid food shop li­cence.</p>
    <p>The es­tab­lish­ment also al­lowed cus­tomers to play pool and con­sume al­co­hol past 10.30pm.</p>
    <p>In an­other in­stance, on Oct 10, STB of­fi­cers con­ducted checks at Kris Bol­ly­wood, lo­cated in Con­corde Ho­tel, and found two peo­ple con­sum­ing al­co­hol on the premises past 10.30pm.</p>
    <p>Both busi­nesses are now un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act 2020, first-time of­fend­ers may be fined up to $10,000. Sub­se­quent of­fences may carry fines of up to $20,000.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Oct 6 and Oct 14, STB is­sued fines rang­ing from $300 to $1,000 to 16 peo­ple for fail­ing to wear a mask. Since the start of phase two, checks have been stepped up at tourism es­tab­lish­ments and precincts.</p>
    <p>Five food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ments were also fined for breach­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures this month.</p>
    <p>Four of them – Ba­gus Sio Good at #01-07A Far East Plaza, Chuan Yang Ji Mut­ton Soup Steam­boat at 211 South Bridge Road, The Hot Gath­er­ing at 32 Up­per Cross Street and Ko­mala’s Restau­rant at 330 Seran­goon Road – had failed to en­sure 1m safe dis­tanc­ing be­tween seated cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>The fifth, Beauty In The Pot at #05-16 The Cen­tre­point, had ac­cepted a book­ing of six per­sons at the same ta­ble, one more than the five al­lowed un­der the law.</p>
