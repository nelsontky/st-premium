    <p>• Alexan­der Zverev said he tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19 af­ter play­ing sick with a fever and breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties in the fourth round of the French Open on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“I re­ceived the re­sult to­day. It’s neg­a­tive. I don’t have Covid-19,” the Ger­man, who lost in the fourth set to Ital­ian Jan­nik Sin­ner, told Eurosport on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been bet­ter. I have a cold. You can also have it dur­ing the Covid-19 pe­riod. We’ve been play­ing at eight de­grees and driz­zle for two weeks.</p>
    <p>“It is nor­mal that the body is tired. I haven’t had a real break af­ter the US Open ei­ther. This is my typ­i­cal cold. I know it al­ready.</p>
    <p>“I have a bit of a sore throat, then a cold and my nose is full fol­lowed at night by fever maybe. The fever was 37.6 (deg C).</p>
    <p>“I wasn’t 100 per cent yes­ter­day and I will take a few days to re­cover.”</p>
    <p>French Open or­gan­is­ers on Sun­day said Zverev’s last test was done on Sept 29 and that he did not con­sult tour­na­ment doc­tors de­spite ex­pe­ri­enc­ing Covid-19 symp­toms.</p>
    <p>They added that his next rou­tine test was sched­uled for this Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Zverev said there was no obli­ga­tion for him to check i n with Roland Gar­ros doc­tors.</p>
    <p>“There was no obli­ga­tion to in­di­cate whether one was ill or not,” the 23-year-old said.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 No­vak Djokovic said he would not be against or­gan­is­ers check­ing body tem­per­a­ture be­fore matches, which is not the case at the French Open.</p>
    <p>“Re­ally, hon­estly, I don’t know how he feels, what is go­ing on, whether they should have the tem­per­a­ture checks,” the Serb said.</p>
    <p>“I wouldn’t mind. I mean, I don’t have any­thing against that. Why not?</p>
    <p>“If that al­lows I guess the med­i­cal team here in Roland Gar­ros and or­gan­i­sa­tion to have a bet­ter idea of whether some­one is hav­ing symp­toms that could be re­lated to this virus, then okay, fine.”</p>
    <p>The French Open was pushed back four months from its tra­di­tional May-June slot due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Health pro­to­cols in Paris, which has seen a surge in in­fec­tions, have been tight­ened with only 1,000 fans al­lowed on site each day.</p>
