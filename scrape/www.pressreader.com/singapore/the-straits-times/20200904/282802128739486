    <p>THE COMPLETE BEETHOVEN</p>
    <p>VI­O­LIN SONATAS: UP CLOSE AND PER­SONAL</p>
    <p>More Than Mu­sic/</p>
    <p>Streamed on Face­book/</p>
    <p>Aug 23, last Satur­day & Sun­day</p>
    <p>This year marks the 250th an­niver­sary of the birth of great Ger­man com­poser Lud­wig van Beethoven (1770-1827). No sym­phony or con­cer­tos cy­cles had been planned in Sin­ga­pore but given the Covid-19 pan­demic, one should be grate­ful for More Than Mu­sic’s on­line cy­cle of his 10 vi­o­lin sonatas.</p>
    <p>Con­trary to ear­lier pub­lic­ity, this is not the first time such a cy­cle has been pre­sented here. Back in 1999, vet­eran Pe­nang-born pi­anist Den­nis Lee per­formed it with five young Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Orches­tra vi­o­lin­ists in three con­certs at Vic­to­ria Con­cert Hall.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, this was still a show­case by a who’s who of Sin­ga­pore’s clas­si­cal scene: vi­o­lin­ists Loh Jun Hong, Chan Yoong Han and Yang Shux­i­ang, part­nered with Abi­gail Sin, Lim Yan and Al­bert Tiu, pi­anists who are also fac­ulty mem­bers of the Yong Siew Toh Con­ser­va­tory.</p>
    <p>The per­for­mances were recorded at Es­planade Recital Stu­dio and they had been re­leased on­line in pub­lished or­der ev­ery Satur­day and Sun­day af­ter­noon since Aug 23.</p>
    <p>The 10 sonatas spanned from 1798 to 1812, en­com­pass­ing the “Early” and “Mid­dle” pe­ri­ods of</p>
    <p>Beethoven’s cre­ative out­put.</p>
    <p>Like his bet­ter known pi­ano sonatas, these dis­play a wealth of ex­pres­sion and fea­ture very dif­fi­cult pi­ano parts which he played him­self. Lit­tle won­der these were of­ten re­ferred to as sonatas for pi­ano with vi­o­lin.</p>
    <p>The early Op.12 tril­ogy is less of­ten heard but of­fers contrasts in emo­tions. No.1 In D Ma­jor estab­lished his spir­ited and ex­tro­verted style, a con­scious re­ac­tion to the gen­til­ity of Mozart’s sonatas for the same in­stru­ments. Loh’s in­ci­sive ap­proach and ex­cel­lent in­to­na­tion, with Sin’s keenly re­spon­sive part­ner­ship, made it a plea­sure to be­hold.</p>
    <p>All the per­form­ers gave a short pre­am­ble, pro­vid­ing suc­cinct in­sights to each work. Sonata No.2 In A Ma­jor was more light­hearted, with even an air of mis­chief. Its hu­mour in the outer move­ments was well cap­tured by Chan and Lim (mem­bers of the well-estab­lished Take Five quin­tet), who also plumbed the depths in the slow move­ment’s more se­ri­ous mo­ments.</p>
    <p>The most ex­u­ber­ant of the set, Sonata No.3 In E Flat Ma­jor suited the duo of Yang and Tiu just fine.</p>
    <p>The for­mer’s un­bri­dled demon­stra­tion of pas­sion found a per­fect foil in the lat­ter’s sen­si­tive yet scin­til­lat­ing fin­ger­work. The cast­ing of the sonatas and al­lo­ca­tion of the re­spec­tive per­form­ers had been spot on through­out.</p>
    <p>Sonata No.4 In A Ma­jor, Op.23, was the first of the stand-alone sonatas. From the out­set, its dra­matic in­ten­sity and bristling en­ergy saw Chan and Sin flex­ing mus­cle and sinew. Its height­ened ten­sion was con­trasted by the minc­ing steps and play of coun­ter­point in the sec­ond move­ment. This was be­fore the fi­nale’s un­ease, bring­ing back ear­lier tri­als and tribu­la­tions for a nervy fin­ish.</p>
    <p>This ex­cel­lently cu­rated cy­cle con­tin­ues with Sonata No.5 and on­wards from Satur­day till Sept 20. To watch, go to www.face­book.com/ MoreThanMu­sicCon­certs.</p>
