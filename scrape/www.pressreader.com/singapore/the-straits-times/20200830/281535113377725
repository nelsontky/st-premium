    <p>At a time when pro­tec­tion­ist sen­ti­ment is on the rise glob­ally, Sin­ga­pore must re­main open to the world in or­der to at­tract in­vest­ments and cre­ate good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said.</p>
    <p>One fac­tor that has played a part in the ex­pan­sion of multi­na­tional com­pa­nies here is the net­work of free trade agree­ments (FTAs) Sin­ga­pore has with ma­jor trad­ing part­ners.</p>
    <p>These FTAs help cre­ate good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans, Mr Chan said, cit­ing how res­i­dent work­ers em­ployed as pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) rose from 1.12 mil­lion in 2014 to 1.3 mil­lion last year. Over this pe­riod, the share of PMETs among em­ployed res­i­dents rose from 53 per cent to 58 per cent.</p>
    <p>His com­ments, in an in­ter­view with The Sun­day Times and Lianhe Zaobao on Friday, come as sen­ti­ments against for­eign­ers and FTAs are sour­ing as the re­ces­sion deep­ens. Some crit­ics of FTAs have said that the pacts favour for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>He said the anx­i­ety Sin­ga­pore­ans have about jobs is un­der­stand­able.</p>
    <p>Cit­i­zens con­tinue to get top pri­or­ity for jobs, Mr Chan stressed, adding that the real is­sue is not the num­ber of for­eign­ers, but a weak econ­omy that is mak­ing every­one wor­ried.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment will help by “go­ing all out” to at­tract in­vest­ments and cre­ate good jobs, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that while short-term mea­sures in­clude fi­nan­cial sup­port for com­pa­nies, jobs match­ing and train­ing pro­grammes, there is a longer-term chal­lenge – help­ing</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans suc­ceed in a hy­per­com­pet­i­tive world post-Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“The for­eign­ers is­sue must be seen in this con­text,” he said.</p>
    <p>In the in­ter­view, Mr Chan spelt out three as­pects of Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion on hav­ing for­eign man­power com­ple­ment a core of cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>One, there must be fair­ness and zero tol­er­ance for dis­crim­i­na­tion of any kind, and tough ac­tion has been taken on firms with hir­ing bias.</p>
    <p>Two, di­ver­sity mat­ters and firms should avoid hir­ing from only a sin­gle source coun­try.</p>
    <p>Three, lo­cal­i­sa­tion – the trans­fer of skills to de­velop a pipe­line of lo­cal tal­ent – is key, and many Sin­ga­pore­ans have ben­e­fited and taken lead­er­ship roles in multi­na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>At a time when some coun­tries are re­assess­ing the ben­e­fits of FTAs, this is not the time to take a wreck­ing ball to the pacts Sin­ga­pore has signed, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>The net­work of FTAs is greater than the sum of its parts, be­cause no in­vestor in Sin­ga­pore plans to serve only one ex­ter­nal mar­ket, he said. There­fore, the more FTAs Sin­ga­pore has, the more com­pet­i­tive it is in at­tract­ing in­vest­ments and cre­at­ing jobs.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially crit­i­cal as Sin­ga­pore is a city-state with­out a nat­u­ral hin­ter­land, he added. “We have to cre­ate what we call a man-made com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage... this ap­plies to all our FTAs.”</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged that it is dif­fi­cult for many Sin­ga­pore­ans to un­der­stand that their com­pa­nies are di­rectly or in­di­rectly serv­ing these mar­kets. But, he said, “in­di­vid­u­ally, bi­lat­er­ally, each and ev­ery FTA adds to the net­work ef­fect”.</p>
    <p>Of Sin­ga­pore’s 25 FTAs, the Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment (Ceca) has of­ten been a tar­get for crit­ics who say it opened the flood­gates for In­dian na­tion­als to enter Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan pointed out that Ceca does not grant In­dian na­tion­als un­con­di­tional ac­cess to Sin­ga­pore and im­mi­gra­tion priv­i­leges. Like all other for­eign­ers, they must meet Sin­ga­pore’s pre­vail­ing em­ploy­ment pass cri­te­ria, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“We must never give up our rights to en­force our own rules, es­pe­cially when it comes to im­mi­gra­tion and cit­i­zen­ship,” he said.</p>
    <p>And while the con­cen­tra­tion of cer­tain na­tion­al­i­ties in high­growth sec­tors – such as in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy and pro­fes­sional and fi­nan­cial ser­vices – is shaped by the choice of sec­tors Sin­ga­pore wants to grow, Mr Chan said, they re­quire a crit­i­cal mass of skilled peo­ple and hence a cer­tain num­ber of for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore­ans are be­ing trained and given a fair play­ing field to com­pete for them, he added.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that as global sup­ply chains reshuf­fle and com­pa­nies re­think their global foot­print, Sin­ga­pore must aim to win not only high value-added ac­tiv­i­ties, but also crit­i­cal parts in the en­tire value chain.</p>
    <p>“It is not enough to just make money and cre­ate good jobs – all those are still nec­es­sary but not suf­fi­cient. We need to have crit­i­cal parts which can­not be eas­ily by­passed by oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>Re­as­sur­ing Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens of their place in the sun, Mr Chan said: “I don’t be­lieve Sin­ga­pore­ans are afraid to com­pete. I’ve ev­ery con­fi­dence in their abil­ity to com­pete.</p>
    <p>“All they are ask­ing for is a fair play­ing field, and to strengthen lo­cal de­vel­op­ment ef­forts. We will make sure that we do this, and this is what we are go­ing to do for the next gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>FAIR PLAY­ING FIELD</p>
    <p>I don’t be­lieve Sin­ga­pore­ans are afraid to com­pete. I’ve ev­ery con­fi­dence in their abil­ity to com­pete. All they are ask­ing for is a fair play­ing field, and to strengthen lo­cal de­vel­op­ment ef­forts. We will make sure that we ’’ do this.</p>
    <p>MR CHAN CHUN SING</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing sums up the Govern­ment’s po­si­tion on for­eign man­power in three words: fair­ness, di­ver­sity, and lo­cal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>First, there is “zero tol­er­ance for dis­crim­i­na­tion of any kind”, he said in an in­ter­view with The Sun­day Times and Lianhe Zaobao on Friday on Sin­ga­pore’s ap­proach to strength­en­ing its work­force even as it had to re­main open to tal­ent and free trade pacts to cre­ate jobs and grow the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies with dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices will be put on the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work watch list, and their ap­pli­ca­tions for for­eign work passes cur­tailed.</p>
    <p>The frame­work was in­tro­duced in 2014 af­ter Sin­ga­pore­ans voiced un­hap­pi­ness about for­eign­ers tak­ing away good-pay­ing pro­fes­sional, man­age­rial, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) jobs from them.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, com­pa­nies that need to tap for­eign man­power should avoid re­cruit­ing from only a sin­gle source.</p>
    <p>“If we want to serve in­ter­na­tional mar­kets, then it is only log­i­cal that busi­nesses have di­verse in­ter­na­tional teams,” Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>It is also good for busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity. As travel re­stric­tions and lock­downs dur­ing Covid-19 have shown, over-re­liance on any sin­gle source of man­power can be dis­rup­tive.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that have a di­verse work­force also fare bet­ter at so­cial in­te­gra­tion, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>Third, lo­cal­i­sa­tion – the trans­fer of skills to de­velop a pipe­line of lo­cal tal­ent – is key. For com­pa­nies that need im­prove­ment in this area, eco­nomic agen­cies and trade as­so­ci­a­tions will work with them to boost their tal­ent de­vel­op­ment sys­tem and prac­tices.</p>
    <p>“Many Sin­ga­pore­ans have ben­e­fited from these de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes and have gone on to lead­er­ship po­si­tions,” said Mr Chan, cit­ing Exxon­Mo­bil Asia-Pa­cific and Shell Sin­ga­pore as ex­am­ples of multi­na­tion­als whose oper­a­tions here are helmed by Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>One fac­tor that has played a part in these multi­na­tional gi­ants growing their pres­ence here is the pro­lif­er­a­tion of free trade agree­ments (FTAs) Sin­ga­pore has in place with ma­jor trad­ing part­ners.</p>
    <p>These FTAs help cre­ate good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans through their net­work ef­fect, added Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>“When­ever in­vestors in­vest in Sin­ga­pore, they do not plan on just serv­ing the lo­cal mar­ket, nor do they plan on serv­ing just one other ex­ter­nal mar­ket,” he said. “The more FTAs we have... the more com­pet­i­tive we are in at­tract­ing in­vest­ments and cre­at­ing jobs.”</p>
    <p>Of Sin­ga­pore’s 25 FTAs, the Sin­ga­pore-In­dia Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment (Ceca) has of­ten been fod­der for crit­ics of the Govern­ment who say it opened the flood­gates for In­dian na­tion­als to enter Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>A lot of the mis­giv­ings about Ceca cen­tre on the be­lief that it grants In­dian na­tion­als and their de­pen­dants un­fet­tered en­try into Sin­ga­pore. Mr Chan coun­tered that Ceca does not grant In­dian na­tion­als un­con­di­tional ac­cess into Sin­ga­pore and im­mi­gra­tion priv­i­leges.</p>
    <p>Like all other for­eign­ers, they must meet Sin­ga­pore’s pre­vail­ing Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) cri­te­ria, such as min­i­mum salary thresh­olds, he said.</p>
    <p>What about the call from some op­po­si­tion par­ties – no­tably the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party – to re­view FTAs, in­clud­ing Ceca?</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said that while it is tempt­ing to play to the gallery, rene­go­ti­at­ing an FTA is not just about what Sin­ga­pore wants. “What bar­gain­ing power do we have to get some­thing from (the other party)? Are we able to get what we want with­out giv­ing up even more?”</p>
    <p>A larger num­ber of FTAs strength­ens Sin­ga­pore’s bar­gain­ing power be­cause it pro­vides more op­tions, he said. “Get­ting rid of FTAs is not the cor­rect an­ti­dote. Rene­go­ti­at­ing an FTA at the wrong time is also not the cor­rect an­ti­dote.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chan noted that the con­cen</p>
    <p>CRE­AT­ING JOBS</p>
    <p>When­ever in­vestors in­vest in Sin­ga­pore, they do not plan on just serv­ing the lo­cal mar­ket, nor do they plan on serv­ing just one other ex­ter­nal mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The more FTAs we have... the more com­pet­i­tive we are in at­tract­ing in­vest­ments and cre­at­ing ’’ jobs.</p>
    <p>TRADE AND IN­DUS­TRY MIN­IS­TER CHAN CHUN SING, on the net­work ef­fect of free trade pacts.</p>
    <p>tra­tion of cer­tain na­tion­al­i­ties in some sec­tors is shaped by the fact that these are high-growth ar­eas com­pet­ing for global tal­ent.</p>
    <p>If Sin­ga­pore fo­cuses its ef­forts on growing a very small set of sec­tors, it may stand a bet­ter chance of en­sur­ing a higher pro­por­tion of lo­cals in each sec­tor, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>But then, the econ­omy be­comes con­cen­trated and frag­ile, and the choices of jobs for the next gen­er­a­tion will be lim­ited.</p>
    <p>“If we want the di­ver­sity of choices, then we will need a cer­tain (for­eign) com­ple­ment to each of these sec­tors,” he said, ad­mit­ting it is a “heartwrenc­hing” dilemma.</p>
    <p>But he said it is the right thing to do – de­velop high-growth sec­tors, cre­ate bet­ter jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans and train them up quickly, and give them a fair play­ing field to com­pete.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will also en­sure it con­tin­ues to in­vest in schools and con­tin­u­ing education so that peo­ple have the skills to stay com­pet­i­tive, in par­tic­u­lar those in their 40s and 50s. The Govern­ment is also help­ing to give older and mid­dle-aged Sin­ga­pore­ans greater help on the jobs and skills front, he added.</p>
    <p>The lat­est ef­fort to level the play­ing field was the an­nounce­ment on Thurs­day that the min­i­mum qual­i­fy­ing salary for EPs and S Passes, which al­low for­eign pro­fes­sion­als and mid-skilled work­ers to work here, will be in­creased.</p>
    <p>From Tues­day, firms ap­ply­ing for new EPs for for­eign pro­fes­sion­als need to pay them at least $4,500 a month, up from $3,900. The bar is higher for those in fi­nan­cial ser­vices – at least $5,000 for new EP hold­ers from Dec 1, the first time a higher qual­i­fy­ing salary is spec­i­fied for a par­tic­u­lar sec­tor.</p>
    <p>What does Mr Chan think of some Sin­ga­pore­ans’ fears that firms will use the op­por­tu­nity to raise the salaries of these for­eign­ers?</p>
    <p>“I don’t see this as a min­i­mum salary. When we raise the head­room (for pay), it ac­tu­ally cre­ates more space for Sin­ga­pore­ans to com­pete,” he said, adding that this must be done pro­gres­sively so as not to shock the sys­tem. “Even as firms move to­wards less re­liance on the lower end of the EP hold­ers, they still need time to make ad­just­ments.”</p>
    <p>He stressed that Sin­ga­pore is still very much open for busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“We need to be the mag­net where peo­ple still want to do busi­ness in, and do busi­ness through.</p>
    <p>“In fact, there are things in the Covid-19 world that have ac­cen­tu­ated our strengths: strong lead­er­ship, a sta­ble en­vi­ron­ment, co­her­ent long-term poli­cies, con­nec­tiv­ity to the world, pro­tec­tion of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty, sta­ble tri­par­tite re­la­tion­ship, skilled work­force and, most im­por­tantly, a pro­gres­sive peo­ple that em­brace the world.”</p>
