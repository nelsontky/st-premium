    <p>A man charged with the care of his in­tel­lec­tu­ally dis­abled daugh­ter sex­u­ally as­saulted the 17-yearold in the bed­room they shared with his brother, who lay sleep­ing while it hap­pened.</p>
    <p>It was not the first time the man, now 52, had as­saulted his daugh­ter. He had done so when she was be­tween six and eight years old.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the man, who can­not be named to pro­tect the victim’s iden­tity, was jailed for 20 years af­ter he pleaded guilty to one count of ag­gra­vated sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion, and an­other count of sex­ual as­sault by pen­e­tra­tion. A third charge of mo­lesta­tion was taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the girl, who has mild in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity, was liv­ing with the man, two of her un­cles, her aunt and an older brother when the in­ci­dent oc­curred in Oc­to­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Her mother had moved out of the mat­ri­mo­nial home some years ago, and the girl and her fa­ther usu­ally slept in the same room, on dif­fer­ent mat­tresses laid side by side, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor (DPP) Sarah Siaw said the girl and one of her un­cles were sleep­ing in the room on dif­fer­ent mat­tresses on Oct 26, 2018, when her fa­ther walked in. The man, who was work­ing as a dish­washer, had been drink­ing ear­lier and he moved next to the girl, and sex­u­ally as­saulted her.</p>
    <p>“The victim found this very painful and she felt scared. She cov­ered her face with both her hands and tried to push the ac­cused away,” said DPP Siaw.</p>
    <p>The man stopped af­ter sev­eral min­utes and fell asleep be­side her, but the victim “cried silently to her­self in bed”.</p>
    <p>His ac­tions were dis­cov­ered later that day when the girl’s teacher no­ticed that she seemed very dis­turbed and asked if she was okay, said DPP Siaw.</p>
    <p>It later emerged that the man had as­saulted her be­fore, in 2008 or 2009, when the girl’s mother was still liv­ing in their mat­ri­mo­nial home. He sex­u­ally abused her in a sim­i­lar man­ner, when her mother was not around one night, said DPP Siaw.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult of be­ing sex­u­ally abused by her fa­ther, the victim de­vel­oped a de­sire to harm her­self. She would use a ruler to try and cut her­self, and also tried to hurt her­self us­ing a sta­pler,” she added.</p>
    <p>DPP Chee Ee Ling said the home is meant to be a“safe haven”, yet the man had ex­ploited his po­si­tion as a fa­ther and vi­o­lated the girl.</p>
