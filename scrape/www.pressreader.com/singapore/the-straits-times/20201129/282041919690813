    <p>Mr Pre­ston Wong, 31, is chief ex­ec­u­tive and lead in­no­va­tor at Treat­sure, an app that serves as a mo­bile mar­ket place for busi­nesses and con­sumers to sell and buy sur­plus food that would oth­er­wise go to waste.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get started?</p>
    <p>A I saw my fam­ily throw­ing out con­sum­ables and ex­pir­ing sur­plus food from our re­frig­er­a­tor and re­alised oth­ers are prob­a­bly do­ing the same, per­pet­u­at­ing the prob­lem of food wastage. An idea then sprang to mind. What if I were to build a plat­form to sell or share sur­plus food items?</p>
    <p>Q How did you marry tech­nol­ogy and vol­un­teerism to tackle food waste?</p>
    <p>A Char­i­ties such as Food From The Heart and SG Food Res­cue are do­ing good work in re­duc­ing food waste, but the man­power needed to col­lect, sort and dis­trib­ute sur­plus food is mas­sive.</p>
    <p>A so­lu­tion us­ing tech­nol­ogy would cre­ate greater im­pact. Ken­neth (Ham, chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer at Treat­sure) and I de­cided to ad­dress this prob­lem by de­vel­op­ing a mo­bile app. We did not know what we were get­ting into – long hours, no salary, and emo­tional strug­gles. It took a year of mar­ket re­search, app de­vel­op­ment and sales pitches be­fore we launched Treat­sure in Septem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>Q What has been the re­sponse to the app?</p>
    <p>A We did not start out with a lot of fan­fare or me­dia aware­ness. My sis­ter and I just bought and dis­trib­uted pas­tries at Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre and Bugis Junc­tion to peo­ple who were will­ing to lis­ten, down­load our app and sub­scribe.</p>
    <p>Today, there are 20,000 sub­scribers, and the num­ber is grow­ing.</p>
    <p>Our busi­ness part­ners are nine hotels that al­low users to pack food from their buf­fets, up to an hour be­fore clos­ing time, for $10 a box. Sub­scribers scan the QR code to buy a box. To sus­tain our vi­a­bil­ity, we take a cut from the busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Q What chal­lenges did the Covid-19 pan­demic and cir­cuit breaker mea­sures pose?</p>
    <p>A Be­fore the pan­demic, Treat­sure ex­panded into the sur­plus gro­cery space. We col­lab­o­rated with start-up Ug­lyFood to save food that had been re­jected or cos­met­i­cally fil­tered be­cause they were bruised, or had dented or torn pack­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>We are glad we did this be­cause when the cir­cuit breaker was im­posed on April 7 – dras­ti­cally chang­ing the buf­fet ex­pe­ri­ence – Treat­sure was able to con­tinue in its quest to re­duce food wastage. We work with on­line gro­cers, su­per­marts and distrib­u­tors, and man­age to give th­ese ab­so­lutely con­sum­able foods a sec­ond lease of life.</p>
    <p>Q What’s next for Treat­sure?</p>
    <p>A For now, the pan­demic and sub­se­quent re­stric­tions re­main an un­cer­tain chal­lenge for our buf­fet and hos­pi­tal­ity seg­ment. So, for sub­scribers, we hope to ex­pand our list of gro­cery part­ners and prod­ucts that can be saved, as well as of­fer users more ac­ces­si­ble self pickup op­tions. Our start-up will also look into re­search and de­vel­op­ment in new tech­nolo­gies and so­lu­tions in re­duc­ing food waste.</p>
    <p>Q Is cut­ting food waste just a busi­ness or also a part of your lifestyle?</p>
    <p>A My fam­ily and I ex­er­cise re­straint, buy only what we need and do not over­stock the fridge. We also find ways to re­pur­pose ex­cess in­gre­di­ents.</p>
