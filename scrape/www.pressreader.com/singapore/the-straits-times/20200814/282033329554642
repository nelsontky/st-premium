    <p>Earn­ings plunged at prop­erty heavy­weight City De­vel­op­ments Limited (CDL) in the first half year as the Covid-19 pan­demic “se­verely im­pacted” its busi­nesses, es­pe­cially its ho­tel op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>CDL group chief ex­ec­u­tive Sher­man Kwek said a thor­ough re­view is on­go­ing for the ho­tels seg­ment, while a close watch is be­ing kept on signs of im­prove­ment in global travel sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>The group is ex­plor­ing the pos­si­ble divest­ments of non-core ho­tels and China in­vest­ment prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>CDL’s net profit for the six months to end-June fell 99.1 per cent to $3.1 mil­lion, from $362 mil­lion for the same pe­riod last year, CDL said yesterday.</p>
    <p>This re­sulted in a first-half loss per share of 0.4 cent, after de­duct­ing pref­er­ence div­i­dends of $6.4 mil­lion which were paid on June 30. This com­pares with earn­ings per share of 39.2 cents in the year-ago pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue for the first half fell 32.8 per cent to $1.07 bil­lion, from $1.6 bil­lion a year ago. The de­cline was seen across all busi­ness seg­ments, but with ho­tel op­er­a­tions ac­count­ing for 82 per cent of the drop.</p>
    <p>CDL ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Kwek</p>
    <p>Leng Beng said pres­sures will re­main on the group’s ho­tel op­er­a­tions in the sub­se­quent quar­ters, al­though its prop­erty de­vel­op­ment and in­vest­ment prop­er­ties seg­ments have been rel­a­tively re­silient.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the un­cer­tain­ties, we are con­fi­dent that with the even­tual pent-up de­mand for travel, the road to re­cov­ery will be ac­cel­er­ated, es­pe­cially when a vac­cine for Covid-19 is likely to be avail­able next year,” he said.</p>
    <p>Earn­ings were mainly dragged down by ho­tel op­er­a­tions post­ing a pre-tax loss of $208.2 mil­lion, which in­cluded $33.9 mil­lion of im­pair­ment losses made in view of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As of end-June, 28 per cent of the group’s 152 ho­tels world­wide were tem­po­rar­ily closed and those that re­mained open were op­er­at­ing at much lower oc­cu­pancy. In con­stant cur­rency, global ho­tel rev­enue per avail­able room fell by 56.6 per cent to $60.30 from $139.10 a year ago, while global oc­cu­pancy dropped to 39.4 per cent from 72.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>CDL noted that earn­ings were also im­pacted by lower di­vest­ment gains, which in the cor­re­spond­ing pe­riod last year in­cluded a $197.2 mil­lion pre-tax gain from the di­vest­ment of Man­ulife Cen­tre and 7 & 9</p>
    <p>Tampines Grande. In con­trast, the di­vest­ment gains for the first half of this year came to $49.9 mil­lion from the sale of Mil­len­nium Ho­tel Cincinnati and the dis­posal of a 75 per cent stake in sub­sidiary Scep­tre Hos­pi­tal­ity Re­sources.</p>
    <p>With the cir­cuit breaker af­fect­ing Sin­ga­pore res­i­den­tial sales in the first half, CDL said the group and joint ven­ture as­so­ciates sold 356 units to­talling $514.7 mil­lion, com­pared with $1.6 bil­lion in sales for the year-ago pe­riod, which also gained from more ul­tra-lux­ury projects that had fat­ter profit mar­gins.</p>
    <p>To date, the group’s 861-unit The Tapestry and the 716-unit Whistler Grand have sold 842 and 576 units re­spec­tively, while Am­ber Park has sold 211 of its 592 units, said CDL. Its joint ven­ture 820-unit ex­ec­u­tive con­do­minium pro­ject, Pier­mont Grand, and the 680-unit Sengkang Grand Res­i­dences, have sold 577 and 255 units re­spec­tively, the com­pany added.</p>
    <p>CDL said it plans to launch in this quar­ter its con­do­minium pro­ject with Hong Leong Hold­ings, the 566-unit Pen­rose in Sims Drive, close to Alju­nied MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Next year, CDL plans to launch a con­do­minium com­pris­ing about 540 units in Ir­well Bank Road, as well as the res­i­den­tial com­po­nent of its joint ven­ture Liang Court re­de­vel­op­ment, com­pris­ing some 700 units.</p>
    <p>The group is also fil­ing for pro­vi­sional per­mis­sion to re­de­velop Fuji Xerox Tow­ers in the Cen­tral Busi­ness District into a 51-storey free­hold mixed-use de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary plan­ning ap­pli­ca­tions are cur­rently be­ing re­viewed to re­de­velop Cen­tral Mall.</p>
    <p>CDL shares closed 1.4 per cent higher at $8.46 yesterday.</p>
