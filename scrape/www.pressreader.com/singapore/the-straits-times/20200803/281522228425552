    <p>Sin­ga­porean Dick­son Yeo’s plead­ing guilty in a US court last month to spy­ing for China has cast a spot­light on the world of es­pi­onage, the role tech­nol­ogy plays and why in­tel­li­gence agen­cies con­tinue to tap in­di­vid­u­als to gather sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion. re­ports.</p>
    <p>At the be­hest of a Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tive, two years ago, Sin­ga­porean Dick­son Yeo con­jured up a con­sul­tancy firm and posted a fake job list­ing on pro­fes­sional net­work­ing site LinkedIn.</p>
    <p>The re­sponse floored him.</p>
    <p>He got over 400 re­sumes, most of them from US mil­i­tary and gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ees with se­cu­rity clear­ances. He sent on those he found in­ter­est­ing to a Chi­nese op­er­a­tive.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, Yeo was ar­rested when he l anded i n the United States for a trip dur­ing which he planned to re­cruit a US Army of­fi­cer as­signed to the Pen­tagon who had re­sponded to the job list­ing.</p>
    <p>On July 24, he pleaded guilty to act­ing within the US as an il­le­gal agent of Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>In court doc­u­ments, the 39-yearold de­scribed LinkedIn’s al­go­rithm as re­lent­less, and he checked it al­most every day to re­view sug­gested po­ten­tial con­tacts.</p>
    <p>He told US law en­force­ment of­fi­cers it felt al­most like an ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>The so­cial net­work­ing site was the plat­form through which Yeo, a PhD stu­dent at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Pub­lic Pol­icy – which re­cently ter­mi­nated his can­di­da­ture af­ter his case came to light – cul­ti­vated Amer­i­cans to pass over non­pub­lic in­for­ma­tion to China.</p>
    <p>This in­for­ma­tion touched on the US Depart­ment of Com­merce, the US-China trade war and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, among other top­ics.</p>
    <p>Yeo’s LinkedIn ac­count was taken down shortly af­ter re­ports of his case sur­faced last month.</p>
    <p>The case has drawn global at­ten­tion and cast a spot­light on ef­forts by in­tel­li­gence agen­cies to tap so­cial net­work­ing sites, es­pe­cially at a time when ten­sions be­tween the US and China are ris­ing.</p>
    <p>Es­pi­onage and in­tel­li­gence gath­er­ing are key ca­pa­bil­i­ties that coun­tries hone to gain an edge – from get­ting bat­tle plans to re­ceiv­ing sen­si­tive tech­no­log­i­cal se­crets, of com­peti­tors and close part­ners alike. Agen­cies also try not to get caught, and try to keep a dis­tance from their agents or deny in­volve­ment when found out.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers tell The Straits Times that every state is in­ter­ested in clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion. And while tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances have helped in­tel­li­gence gath­er­ing to a large ex­tent, states will con­tinue to find and cul­ti­vate tar­gets like Yeo to get an edge.</p>
    <p>Dr Ben­jamin Ho of Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies (RSIS), who spe­cialises in Chi­nese for­eign pol­icy and na­tional se­cu­rity (in­tel­li­gence), said spy­ing “is not just be­tween the US and China, but even among coun­tries that are sup­pos­edly ‘friendly’ to each other”.</p>
    <p>Yeo was him­self tar­geted by Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cials some time in 2015. Af­ter giv­ing a pre­sen­ta­tion in Bei­jing on the po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion in South-east Asia, he was ap­proached by var­i­ous in­di­vid­u­als who claimed to rep­re­sent Chin­abased think-tanks.</p>
    <p>They of­fered him money in ex­change for po­lit­i­cal re­ports and in­for­ma­tion. Yeo came to know that they were in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tives of China and, over the next four years, he was drawn in deeper.</p>
    <p>He also got a post as a vis­it­ing scholar at Ge­orge Washington Univer­sity’s Sigur Cen­tre for Asian Stud­ies for the first half of last year.</p>
    <p>Yeo’s case comes in the wake of last year’s sen­tenc­ing of two for­mer Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency (CIA) of­fi­cers, Jerry Chun Shing Lee and Kevin Mal­lory, who had traded se­crets with Chi­nese in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tives. The two US cit­i­zens, who re­ceived pay­ments from their spy­mas­ters, were sen­tenced sep­a­rately to 19- and 20-year jail terms, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Lee’s work was said to have led to the dev­as­tat­ing col­lapse of a CIA net­work of in­for­mants in China, with many of them van­ish­ing – ei­ther im­pris­oned or ex­e­cuted.</p>
    <p>In­tel­li­gence ex­pert Neil Quarmby ex­pects more spy networks to be un­cov­ered as coun­tries re­di­rect their ef­forts to present threats, and as the fo­cus shifts away from counter-ter­ror­ism, with the threat from the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>“As the Western in­tel­li­gence sys­tems take a deep breath from ISIS, their counter-in­tel­li­gence sys­tems have recog­nised a loss of fo­cus from state threats,” said Mr Quarmby, chief ex­ec­u­tive of In­tel­li­gence Ris­ing, who has had an ex­ten­sive ca­reer in in­tel­li­gence span­ning the Aus­tralian mil­i­tary, law en­force­ment and reg­u­la­tory agen­cies.</p>
    <p>“There has been a sig­nif­i­cant shift in counter-in­tel­li­gence pri­or­ity to tar­get for­eign in­tel­li­gence in­flu­ence in re­cent years. This is likely to con­tinue and re­ceive greater in­vest­ment. Over the next 10 years, such pro­tracted counter-in­tel­li­gence work is likely to of­fer up a lot more cases pub­licly,” he said.</p>
    <p>FROM DEAD DROP TO DROPBOX</p>
    <p>What mod­ern-day spies face in the field may dif­fer from what it used to be dur­ing the Cold War when the US and the Soviet Union were deadly ad­ver­saries. With the threat of nu­clear war loom­ing on the hori­zon, the stakes were high as both na­tions and their al­lies en­gaged in de­cep­tion to ob­tain sen­si­tive tech­nol­ogy or tac­ti­cal and strate­gic in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Agents of­ten en­gaged in dead drops, pre­ar­ranged lo­ca­tions to drop off and pick up items, and brush passes, or brief en­coun­ters in pub­lic, to re­lay in­for­ma­tion covertly. They were trained in surveil­lance de­tec­tion tech­niques to make sure they were not be­ing fol­lowed. Small cam­eras were used to pho­to­graph clas­si­fied and se­cret doc­u­ments. Pro­cessed films were of­ten stuffed into false book spines or fish­ing rod han­dles be­fore be­ing passed to han­dlers.</p>
    <p>Such mea­sures were nec­es­sary be­cause cap­tured spies were rarely re­claimed by the gov­ern­ment that dis­patched them. The pun­ish­ment was of­ten a long jail term, or death.</p>
    <p>To­day, ad­vance­ments in com­mu­ni­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy of­fer some pro­tec­tion and plau­si­ble de­ni­a­bil­ity when things go wrong.</p>
    <p>All that is needed is a smart­phone to re­lay in­for­ma­tion, videos and</p>
    <p>doc­u­ments us­ing en­crypted soft­ware. So­cial net­work­ing sites are of­ten used, as are file-shar­ing ser­vices like Dropbox.</p>
    <p>Proxy agents from third coun­tries – like Yeo – are use­ful to in­crease the de­ni­a­bil­ity fac­tor. This way, in­tel­li­gence gath­er­ing can be done from a safe dis­tance – how Yeo’s han­dlers had run his spy ring.</p>
    <p>To­day, in­tel­li­gence agen­cies also cast their nets on­line to fish for po­ten­tial tar­gets. RSIS re­search fel­low Muham­mad Faizal Abdul Rahman noted that in­tel­li­gence ser­vices use Osint, or open source in­tel­li­gence, in­clud­ing so­cial me­dia and net­work­ing plat­forms, to spot po­ten­tial agent can­di­dates with spe­cialised knowl­edge and tal­ent, as well as ac­cess to clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“The In­ter­net and so­cial me­dia are meant to be open, free and con­nect peo­ple across bor­ders,” said Mr Faizal, who spe­cialises in home­land se­cu­rity, in­tel­li­gence and coun­tert­er­ror­ism. “Th­ese fea­tures un­for­tu­nately also pro­vide more ef­fi­cient means for var­i­ous threat ac­tors such as crim­i­nals, ter­ror­ists, dis­in­for­ma­tion creators and hos­tile in­tel­li­gence ser­vices to com­mu­ni­cate, re­cruit and fa­cil­i­tate their op­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>But with a plethora of in­for­ma­tion read­ily avail­able on­line, does it mean spies are no longer needed to col­lect Hu­mint, or hu­man in­tel­li­gence? Far from it.</p>
    <p>“While the in­for­ma­tion age has de­liv­ered ex­po­nen­tially in­creas­ing data, it has not de­liv­ered mean­ing (es­pe­cially in re­la­tion to hu­man in­tent), and hence the de­mand for hu­man in­tel­li­gence has only strength­ened,” said Mr Quarmby.</p>
    <p>“Good hu­man in­tel­li­gence sys­tems still rely heav­ily on the per­sonal touch – as this usu­ally forms part of the value sought by the agent be­ing ex­ploited.”</p>
    <p>But not all in­for­ma­tion or can­di­dates are prized, said Dr Ho of RSIS.</p>
    <p>“The re­cruiter – not un­like an HR prac­ti­tioner – would have to suss out the gold from the dross,” he said. Of strate­gic value – whether to other states, busi­ness cor­po­ra­tions or crim­i­nal networks – is non-pub­lic in­for­ma­tion on mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties, eco­nomic and for­eign poli­cies, and re­search on sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy. Equally sought, said Mr Quarmby, are can­di­dates who can be nur­tured due to their ac­cess to vi­tal in­for­ma­tion at a later time or their abil­ity to in­flu­ence or re­duce “the voice of de­bate in a so­ci­ety to sup­port the com­mu­ni­cated po­si­tion of an­other state”.</p>
    <p>NOTH­ING COINCIDENT­AL</p>
    <p>That a re­searcher like Yeo, whose pro­posed PhD the­sis topic was China’s treat­ment of small states of strate­gic value, was tar­geted for re­cruit­ment is likely no co­in­ci­dence, ob­servers note.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing is cal­cu­lated when a per­son ends up in the cross hairs of an in­tel­li­gence agency, said Mr</p>
    <p>Mikko Niemela, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Cy­ber In­tel­li­gence House.</p>
    <p>Sup­posed “ca­sual en­coun­ters” at diplo­matic func­tions or along univer­sity cor­ri­dors, or even self-in­tro­duc­tions on so­cial me­dia por­tals, are pre­med­i­tated.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese agen­cies don’t ap­proach any­one with­out a plan, so they have al­ready found some­thing in the pro­file that can be used to ad­vance their in­ter­ests,” said Mr Niemela, who also leads a Dark Web re­search team in the United Na­tions Of­fice on Drugs and Crime.</p>
    <p>When a po­ten­tial tar­get’s vul­ner­a­bil­ity is un­cov­ered – a fi­nan­cial prob­lem, an ad­dic­tion or even em­bar­rass­ing per­sonal in­for­ma­tion – it be­comes eas­ier to re­cruit the agent. Added Mr Niemela: “Spy agen­cies rarely push any­one to do some­thing il­le­gal. They would rather lure peo­ple in, and once they are in, they are re­minded that they (have) crossed the line and now it is a good idea to co­op­er­ate fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>There are three stages – spot­ting the tal­ent, re­cruit­ing the per­son and man­ag­ing the case – in the process, ex­plained Mr Quarmby.</p>
    <p>Once iden­ti­fied, the agent would be nudged into smaller, dis­crete on­line networks where re­cruit­ment oc­curs. Mr Quarmby said: “Uni­ver­si­ties pro­vide in­ter­nal so­cial networks en­abling this, for ex­am­ple, but equally there are nu­mer­ous sys­tems for chat rooms and chat networks avail­able to preda­tory in­tel­li­gence sys­tems.”</p>
    <p>In Yeo’s case, he got one of the can­di­dates to write a re­port on the geopo­lit­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions of Ja­pan pur­chas­ing the F-35 stealth fighter jet from the US.</p>
    <p>An­other, a US State Depart­ment em­ployee, wrote a re­port on an un­named mem­ber of the US Cab­i­net.</p>
    <p>Yeo paid them to write re­ports that he said were meant for clients in Asia. In re­al­ity, they were se­cretly sent to the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment. The writ­ers un­wit­tingly be­came Yeo’s agents.</p>
    <p>The Fi­nan­cial Times, in a re­port last Fri­day, said Yeo’s case un­der­scores “grow­ing fears among in­tel­li­gence agen­cies around the world that they are un­able to parry China’s in­creas­ingly as­tute on­line es­pi­onage ef­forts aimed at of­fi­cials with high-level se­cu­rity clear­ances”. FT cited a se­nior US counter-in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cial as say­ing that spies are known to pose as head­hunters with en­tic­ing ca­reer op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Yeo’s case may have also re­cast the spot­light on academia as a cover for spies. A re­search fel­low at a Sin­ga­pore in­sti­tute, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity, said that over the years, he has oc­ca­sion­ally faced sus­pi­cious ap­proaches for paid anal­y­sis on se­cu­rity-re­lated sub­jects.</p>
    <p>But he was cau­tious about tak­ing such jobs, es­pe­cially if the re­quest came out of the blue.</p>
    <p>“There are peo­ple who claim to be work­ing for le­git­i­mate or­gan­i­sa­tions, but I am un­able to ver­ify their claims,” said the re­search fel­low.</p>
    <p>“I get more sus­pi­cious and will im­me­di­ately de­cline the work if my due dili­gence checks end up with noth­ing on the or­gan­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>RSIS’ Mr Faizal noted that aca­demic in­sti­tu­tions are “tem­ples of knowl­edge and tal­ent, and have been the ground for spy re­cruit­ment and ac­tiv­i­ties for var­i­ous in­tel­li­gence ser­vices as far back as World War II”. He added: “This is some­thing peo­ple in aca­demic cir­cles should be aware of, given re­cent cases and cy­ber at­tacks tar­get­ing re­search in­sti­tu­tions.”</p>
    <p>PERVASIVE IN­TER­EST</p>
