    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has led to peo­ple spend­ing more time on their dig­i­tal de­vices at home. This can cause dig­i­tal eye strain – vi­sion- and eye-re­lated symp­toms aris­ing from the pro­longed use of dig­i­tal de­vices, which can cause blurred vi­sion, tired eyes and headaches, say oph­thal­mol­o­gists.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive Shushan­nah Lee started hav­ing blurry vi­sion and eye fa­tigue dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>She would use her lap­top for eight to 12 hours a day while work­ing from home, and in be­tween those hours, she would also use her mo­bile phone. On week­ends, she would un­wind by binge-watch­ing Netflix on tele­vi­sion for 10 hours.</p>
    <p>She also had poor eye-care habits, like po­si­tion­ing the screens too close to her eyes.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, the 29-year-old, who wears spec­ta­cles, thought her blurry vi­sion could be caused by wors­en­ing my­opia. But when she con­sulted an oph­thal­mol­o­gist last month, she found out she had dig­i­tal eye strain.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal eye strain refers to a clus­ter of vi­sion- and eye-re­lated symp­toms aris­ing from the pro­longed use of dig­i­tal de­vices such as com­put­ers, tablets and mo­bile phones.</p>
    <p>Dr Errol Chan, a con­sul­tant oph­thal­mol­o­gist at LSC Eye Clinic, said the Covid-19 pan­demic has led to peo­ple spend­ing more time on dig­i­tal de­vices.</p>
    <p>Video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­forms, we­bi­nars, e-learn­ing cour­ses and home-based learn­ing for stu­dents have be­come more com­mon.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple have also been watch­ing shows and play­ing games more of­ten on their smart­phones, es­pe­cially dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Dr Chan has seen an in­crease in the num­ber of pa­tients with dig­i­tal eye strain, as a re­sult of the uptick in dig­i­tal screen use.</p>
    <p>“Some of my pa­tients have to use their de­vices for 12 hours or more, mostly for work. They ad­mit that they are spend­ing more time on their de­vices than be­fore,” he said.</p>
    <p>Even out­side the home, peo­ple of­ten have to whip out their smart­phones to check in and out of places us­ing SafeEn­try or to look at restau­rant menus on their phones.</p>
    <p>The LED light emit­ted from screens can strain the eyes.</p>
    <p>“The glare from it makes it more dif­fi­cult for us to ap­pre­ci­ate a clear and crisp im­age, so the eyes strain in an at­tempt to bring the ob­ject of in­ter­est into fo­cus,” said Dr Chan.</p>
    <p>Symp­toms of dig­i­tal eye strain in­clude dis­com­fort, tear­ing, blur­ring of vi­sion, red­ness, a dry eye sen­sa­tion and headaches.</p>
    <p>Dr Daniel Chua, a con­sul­tant at the re­frac­tive surgery de­part­ment of the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Eye Cen­tre, said these symp­toms re­sult from peo­ple look­ing at the screens of dig­i­tal de­vices for a long time, sim­i­lar to read­ing, writ­ing or per­form­ing ac­tiv­i­ties such as sewing for a long pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“The symp­toms may be wors­ened by look­ing at small screens, tak­ing in­suf­fi­cient breaks or the use of wrong pre­scrip­tion glasses,” he added.</p>
    <p>One of the symp­toms Ms Lee, the mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive, ex­pe­ri­enced was dry­ness of the eyes.</p>
    <p>Adults aged 40 and above should un­dergo eye-dis­ease screen­ing to mon­i­tor vi­sion changes, as age-re­lated eye con­di­tions such as glau­coma and cataracts are more likely to oc­cur.</p>
    <p>She said: “Some­times, I get en­grossed with work on the lap­top and for­get to blink, which causes my eyes to be­come dry. Once, my left eye was so dry, my con­tact lens fell out.”</p>
    <p>She now uses lu­bri­cat­ing eye drops daily to keep her eyes moist and re­lieve symp­toms as­so­ci­ated with the strain.</p>
    <p>Dr Chan said star­ing at a dig­i­tal screen for a long time and for­get­ting to blink of­ten leads to dry eyes.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained that blink­ing al­lows a layer of tears to coat the corneas and pre­vents the eyes from dry­ing out.</p>
    <p>Mr Martin Cabr­era, a health­care pro­fes­sional, found out he had dig­i­tal eye strain in Au­gust when he saw an oph­thal­mol­o­gist for blurred vi­sion and dry eyes.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old said the symp­toms first be­came no­tice­able in May, when he spent long hours play­ing games on his mo­bile phone at home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. He also of­ten switched off the ceil­ing light and re­lied on the light from his screen to use his phone.</p>
    <p>Like Ms Lee, he now uses lu­bri­cat­ing eye drops daily and takes short breaks in be­tween us­ing his lap­top and mo­bile phone. He also lim­its the amount of time he spends on dig­i­tal de­vices.</p>
    <p>There is no med­i­cal ev­i­dence sug­gest­ing that pro­longed use of dig­i­tal de­vices causes long-term harm to one’s vi­sion, both doc­tors said.</p>
    <p>Short-term prob­lems such as dry eyes and blurred vi­sion tend to im­prove with the re­duc­tion of dig­i­tal de­vice use, said Dr Chua.</p>
    <p>To re­duce eye fa­tigue, take reg­u­lar breaks and l ook at dis­tant ob­jects for 20 sec­onds af­ter 20 min­utes of screen time, he advised.</p>
    <p>He also sug­gested op­ti­mis­ing the home-of­fice set-up, such as us­ing larger screens and il­lu­mi­nat­ing the work space with a ta­ble lamp to re­duce eye strain.</p>
    <p>Dr Chua urged adults aged 20 to 39 to go for a com­pre­hen­sive eye ex­am­i­na­tion if they are suf­fer­ing from an eye in­jury or have a fam­ily his­tory of eye dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Adults aged 40 and above should un­dergo eye-dis­ease screen­ing to mon­i­tor vi­sion changes, as agere­lated eye con­di­tions such as glau­coma and cataracts are more likely to oc­cur.</p>
    <p>They should con­sult their doc­tor on the fre­quency of sub­se­quent screen­ings, said Dr Chua.</p>
    <p>While most in­di­vid­u­als with dig­i­tal eye strain can man­age their symp­toms with sim­ple mea­sures, Dr Chan said it is im­por­tant for peo­ple to seek help if the symp­toms do not im­prove.</p>
    <p>“The symp­toms are not all spe­cific to dig­i­tal eye strain and can be caused by other eye con­di­tions as well,” he said.</p>
