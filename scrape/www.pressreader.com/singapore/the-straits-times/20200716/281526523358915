    <p>Zom­bie flick Train To Bu­san: Penin­sula is poised to be a hit around Asia, not just be­cause it is the highly an­tic­i­pated fol­low-up to Train To Bu­san (2016), a movie that set a record for South Korean films around the world. It is also the first brand-name ac­tion movie to be re­leased in theatres as most Hol­ly­wood films have been moved to next month and be­yond.</p>
    <p>The cast and di­rec­tor of zom­bie movie Train To Bu­san: Penin­sula would like to wel­come every­one back to re­opened cin­e­mas, but they add a note of cau­tion.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Yeon Sang-ho, 42, says: “Penin­sula is meant to be seen in theatres, but it should be seen safely.”</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Lee Jung-hyun, 40, adds: “Wear a mask.”</p>
    <p>The film is poised to be a hit around Asia, not just be­cause it is the highly an­tic­i­pated fol­low-up to Train To Bu­san (2016), a movie that set a record for South Korean films in Sin­ga­pore and around the world.</p>
    <p>It is the first brand-name ac­tion movie to be re­leased in theatres as most Hol­ly­wood films have been moved to Au­gust and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Ac­tor Gang Dong-won (Se­cret Re­u­nion, 2010), who plays ex­sol­dier Jung-suk, an es­capee who re­turns to the zom­bie zone of the Korean penin­sula to re­trieve looted cash, recog­nises the op­por­tune tim­ing.</p>
    <p>“Glob­ally, the film in­dus­try is suf­fer­ing a very dif­fi­cult time... With Penin­sula be­ing in the box of­fice as the first block­buster, I hope that this will spark some kind of hope for the global film in­dus­try,” the 39-year-old says in an e-mail in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>In the fol­low-up, which takes place four years af­ter the events of the first movie, Jung-suk is among the many Korean refugees shel­ter­ing in Asian coun­tries, where his coun­try­men are seen as dis­eased. The en­tire Korean penin­sula, over­run by the un­dead, has been sealed.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing lost ev­ery­thing he loved dur­ing the evac­u­a­tion and treated like scum in Hong Kong, he is dis­il­lu­sioned with hu­man­ity. Then a triad makes him an of­fer: Lead a team of raiders into the hot zone, re­trieve looted cash and be­gin a new life as a rich man in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The movie is an am­bi­tious de­par­ture from the first movie. Ac­tion scenes have been scaled up and a land­scape of a city in ru­ins has been cre­ated.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor and co-writer Yeon says he got the idea for us­ing the first film as an ori­gin story, then jump­ing off to a larger, more am­bi­tious se­quel even be­fore he be­gan shoot­ing the first movie, which he also di­rected.</p>
    <p>While scout­ing lo­ca­tions for Train To Bu­san, he hit on the idea of a se­quel set in a des­o­late zone, a place where re­turn­ing es­capees are forced to con­front not just dan­ger, but survivor guilt.</p>
    <p>“Train To Bu­san ex­plored the fears of nor­mal peo­ple fac­ing an un­known virus. Penin­sula has a dif­fer­ent kind of hor­ror. Jung-suk, af­ter es­cap­ing the virus, has to face another kind of fear – ex­plor­ing an un­known place.”</p>
    <p>Another thing that has changed in four years is the growth of the dig­i­tal ef­fects in­dus­try in South Korea. Back in 2016, the more am­bi­tious, large-scale scenes i n Penin­sula could not have been done ef­fec­tively, says Yeon.</p>
    <p>“When we first en­vi­sioned the sto­ry­line, we wor­ried if this was even pos­si­ble with Korea’s film in­dus­try be­cause of the mas­sive set­tings re­quired. We doubted we could even cre­ate the look of a waste­land.”</p>
    <p>But once pro­duc­tion started, those wor­ries proved to be un­founded.</p>
    <p>He says: “We re­alised that Korea’s film in­dus­try has im­proved tremen­dously.”</p>
