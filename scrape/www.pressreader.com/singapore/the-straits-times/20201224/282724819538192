    <p>The ex-girl­friend of Stephen Chow has lost her law­suit against the Hong Kong ac­tor-di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>She had ac­cused him of fail­ing to pay her com­mis­sion to­talling more than HK$70 mil­lion (S$12 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the judg­ment re­leased by the Hong Kong High Court yes­ter­day, Ms Alice Yu will thus have to foot the le­gal fees in­curred.</p>
    <p>Chow, 58, and Ms Yu, 49, split up in 2010 af­ter a 13-year re­la­tion­ship. He has di­rected hits such as Kung Fu Hus­tle (2004), CJ7 (2008) and The Mer­maid (2016).</p>
    <p>Ms Yu tes­ti­fied in court last month that she and Chow had reached a ver­bal agree­ment on the com­mis­sion on Christ­mas Eve in 2002.</p>
    <p>He had sug­gested giv­ing her a bi­cy­cle as a gift. But she then pro­posed a 10 per cent com­mis­sion on their in­vest­ments, in­clud­ing three lux­ury units with five park­ing spa­ces and projects un­der his in­vest­ment fund.</p>
    <p>Chow ad­mit­ted in court to mak­ing the prom­ise, but he said they were merely “sweet words” ut­tered dur­ing courtship.</p>
    <p>Ms Yu in­sisted that he was then both her boyfriend and busi­ness part­ner, with the ver­bal agree­ment hence a busi­ness con­tract and legally en­force­able, or Chow would not have shared some in­vest­ments prof­its with her af­ter their break-up.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tor said the money was a gift to her with no other mo­tives.</p>
    <p>The judge ruled in favour of Chow yes­ter­day, say­ing that Ms Yu did not act as an agent for the prop­er­ties and did not fa­cil­i­tate his in­vest­ments.</p>
