    <p>NEW YORK • Mr Barack Obama has been por­trayed sev­eral times in movies and tele­vi­sion se­ri­als.</p>
    <p>The for­mer United States pres­i­dent has been played by ac­tors such as Parker Sawyers in the bi­o­graph­i­cal ro­man­tic drama Southside With You (2016), Devon Ter­rell in the bi­o­graph­i­cal film Barry (2016) and Kings­ley Ben-Adir in the mini-se­ries The Comey Rule (2020).</p>
    <p>Cana­dian rap­per Drake may have the chance to join the list if there is an­other biopic on Mr Obama, who was in of­fice from 2009 to 2017.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent in­ter­view on 360 With Speedy Mor­man with Com­plex News host Speedy Mor­man, Mr Obama, 59, gave his sup­port to Cana­dian rap­per Drake to play him should an op­por­tu­nity arise.</p>
    <p>“You know what, Drake has – more im­por­tantly, I think – my house­hold’s stamp of ap­proval,” Mr Obama said. “I sus­pect Malia and Sasha would be just fine with it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Obama is mar­ried to Mrs Michelle Obama and the cou­ple have two daugh­ters, Malia, 22, and Sasha, 19. Malia is said to be a huge fan of Drake, ac­cord­ing to web­site</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood Life.</p>
    <p>Drake, 34, has ex­pressed his wish to play Mr Obama as early as 10 years ago when the then pres­i­dent was in his first term in of­fice. “I hope some­body makes a movie about Obama’s life soon be­cause I could play him. That’s the goal,” Drake said in an in­ter­view with Pa­per magazine in 2010.</p>
    <p>“I watch all the ad­dresses. Any­time I see him on TV, I don’t change the chan­nel, I def­i­nitely pay at­ten­tion and lis­ten to the in­flec­tions of his voice,” said the rap­per, who gained recog­ni­tion as an ac­tor on Cana­dian teen drama tele­vi­sion se­ries De­grassi: The Next Gen­er­a­tion (2001 to 2015).</p>
    <p>“If you ask any­one who knows me, I’m pretty good at im­pres­sions,” the God’s Plan singer added.</p>
    <p>Asked by Speedy Mor­man about Drake’s am­bi­tion to play him, Mr Obama, who re­leased his mem­oir A Promised Land last month, said: “I will say this. Drake seems to be able to do any­thing he wants. I mean, that is a tal­ented, tal­ented brother. So, if the time comes and he’s ready...”</p>
    <p>Drake has so far not re­sponded to Mr Obama’s en­dorse­ment.</p>
