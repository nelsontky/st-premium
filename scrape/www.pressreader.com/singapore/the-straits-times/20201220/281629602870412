    <p>Fresh waves of Covid-19 in­fec­tions around the world have spurred gov­ern­ments to in­tro­duce social re­stric­tions in a move to con­trol the out­breaks, damp­en­ing the oth­er­wise fes­tive Christ­mas sea­son, par­tic­u­larly in Europe.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures rolled out in­clude lim­it­ing the num­ber of at­ten­dees in gath­er­ings, shut­ting down bars and restau­rants ex­cept for take­aways, and in­tro­duc­ing cur­fews.</p>
    <p>The tougher mea­sures come as in­fec­tions spike in coun­tries such as South Korea, the United States and Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the mea­sures taken in dif­fer­ent places to cope with the pan­demic:</p>
    <p>UNITED KING­DOM</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son yes­ter­day an­nounced a “stay at home” or­der for London and south-east Eng­land to slow a new coro­n­avirus strain that is sig­nif­i­cantly more in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The new strain of the virus “does ap­pear to be passed on sig­nif­i­cantly more eas­ily”, Mr John­son said at a tele­vised brief­ing.</p>
    <p>He or­dered new re­stric­tions for London and south-eastern Eng­land from to­day, say­ing that un­der the new “tier four” rules, “res­i­dents in those ar­eas must stay at home” at least un­til Dec 30.</p>
    <p>Un­der tier four, all non-es­sen­tial shops will be closed, and all for­eign travel banned ex­cept for es­sen­tial pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son, af­ter emer­gency talks with his most se­nior of­fi­cials, can­celled plans to ease pan­demic re­stric­tions for five days dur­ing the hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>House­hold mix­ing will be banned in London and the south­east and so­cial­is­ing is re­stricted to just Christ­mas Day across the rest of Eng­land.</p>
    <p>GER­MANY</p>
    <p>Europe’s largest econ­omy en­tered a lock­down last Wed­nes­day to try and bring soar­ing Covid-19 cases un­der con­trol as fears mounted that the pan­demic was spi­ralling out of con­trol, re­ported Reuters. Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel and the 16 state gov­er­nors an­nounced last Sun­day a tough lock­down un­til Jan 10 at the ear­li­est.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel yes­ter­day urged Ger­mans to avoid vis­it­ing fam­ily mem­bers over Christ­mas and to use video calls in­stead for greet­ings.</p>
    <p>Shops and schools have been shut since last Wed­nes­day, in a pre-Christ­mas tight­en­ing of re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>FRANCE</p>
    <p>Bou­tiques in the cen­tre of Paris shut early and shop­pers hur­ried home to meet a new 8pm cur­few im­posed last Tues­day, to try to pre­vent a new spike in Covid-19 in­fec­tions, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment re­placed a stayat-home or­der with the nightly cur­few. From 8pm un­til 6am, peo­ple can go out only for work, on of­fi­cial business, or for med­i­cal rea­sons. Any­one break­ing the cur­few is li­able for a €135 (S$219) fine.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials re­in­stated some of the tough rules that were im­posed four months ago and sub­se­quently lifted, af­ter the re­lax­ation saw a new wave of the Covid-19 out­break rise to­wards its peak.</p>
    <p>Un­til Wed­nes­day, restau­rants can­not serve dine-in cus­tomers be­tween 6pm and 4.59am the fol­low­ing day. There is also a cap of two pa­trons per ta­ble dur­ing dine-in hours. Busi­nesses such as gyms, sports cen­tres, as well as beauty and mas­sage par­lours, are also closed. Ban­quets have to cut ca­pac­ity from a max­i­mum of 40 pa­trons to 20, while more civil ser­vants are to work from home.</p>
    <p>PHILIP­PINES</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte said par­tial re­stric­tions would re­main in the cap­i­tal re­gion un­til the end of the year, with the gov­ern­ment urg­ing Filipinos to limit Christ­mas gath­er­ings to pre­vent a post-hol­i­day surge in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple must wear masks and face shields and ob­serve social dis­tanc­ing in Metro Manila as well as in Davao and six other ar­eas for the whole of this month, while less strin­gent re­stric­tions will be en­forced for the rest of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In­te­rior Sec­re­tary Ed­uardo Ano said Christ­mas par­ties, fam­ily re­unions and carol singing out­side homes are con­sid­ered pro­hib­ited mass gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>UNITED STATES</p>
    <p>Re­sponses to the Covid-19 pan­demic vary ac­cord­ing to each state. For ex­am­ple, Cal­i­for­nia Gov­er­nor Gavin New­som an­nounced on Dec 3 new lock­down or­ders that will last for at least three weeks.</p>
    <p>They ban out­door din­ing for the sec­ond time this year in most of the state and shut down per­son­al­care ser­vices such as hair and nail sa­lons, and play­grounds.</p>
    <p>In Delaware, Gov­er­nor John Car­ney is­sued a stay-at-home ad­vi­sory, ask­ing peo­ple not to gather in­doors with any­one out­side their house­hold.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Michi­gan Gov­er­nor Gretchen Whit­mer or­dered a three-week shut­down that closed casi­nos and cin­e­mas and sus­pended in-per­son high school and col­lege classes.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment pro­vides in­for­ma­tion on how to cope with Covid-19, in­clud­ing guide­lines on how em­ploy­ers and work­ers can im­ple­ment safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures at work­places, but states vary widely on their pan­demic re­sponse.</p>
    <p>SOUTH KOREA</p>
    <p>South Korea is con­sid­er­ing rais­ing social dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions to the high­est level as Covid-19 cases surge.</p>
    <p>Phase 3, the top level in a fivetier sys­tem, would shut down large sec­tors of the econ­omy, with peo­ple hav­ing to stay at home. All but es­sen­tial per­son­nel would be asked to work from home. Schools would be closed and only on­line classes per­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, the gov­ern­ment or­dered schools to close from the next day in Seoul and sur­round­ing ar­eas – a re­gion cur­rently un­der the sec­ond-high­est phase 2.5.</p>
    <p>The rest of the coun­try is un­der phase 2.</p>
    <p>ITALY</p>
    <p>The coun­try has an­nounced a new regime of re­stric­tions un­til Jan 6 that in­cludes lim­its on peo­ple leav­ing their homes more than once a day, clos­ing non-es­sen­tial shops, bars and restau­rants, and curbs on re­gional travel.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious cel­e­bra­tions will be al­lowed only un­til 10pm, Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Food shops, hair­dress­ing sa­lons, phar­ma­cies, to­bac­conists and laun­dries as well as book­stores will, how­ever, re­main open.</p>
    <p>The con­fine­ment would be re­laxed on Dec 28, 29, 30 and on Jan 4, when shops can re­main open un­til 9pm and peo­ple will be al­lowed to move about freely, Mr Conte said. He also asked Ital­ians to re­spect a new rule which lim­its host­ing guests at home to two adults.</p>
    <p>AUS­TRIA</p>
    <p>Aus­tria or­dered non-es­sen­tial stores to close again, while restau­rants and ho­tels will re­main shut.</p>
    <p>Schools will not re­open as usual af­ter the Christ­mas hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures take ef­fect on Dec 26 and will be lifted on Jan 18.</p>
