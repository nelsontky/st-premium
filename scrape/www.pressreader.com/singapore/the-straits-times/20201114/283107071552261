    <p>Cana­dian R&B singer The Weeknd will per­form at this sea­son’s Su­per Bowl half-time show, the Na­tional Foot­ball League (NFL) an­nounced on Wed­nes­day, a cov­eted slot likely to face re­stric­tions due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The NFL’s se­lec­tion of the star, whose real name is Abel Tes­faye, is in line with Amer­i­can foot­ball’s ef­forts in re­cent years to shake off its rep­u­ta­tion for pri­ori­tis­ing age­ing clas­sic rock acts over younger, more di­verse artists.</p>
    <p>“We all grow up watch­ing the world’s big­gest acts play­ing the Su­per Bowl and one can only dream of be­ing in that po­si­tion,” The Weeknd, 30, said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“I’m hum­bled, hon­oured and ec­static to be the centre of that in­fa­mous stage this year,” con­tin­ued the star known for hits such as Blind­ing Lights and Star­boy, a col­lab­o­ra­tion with French dan­ce­pop duo Daft Punk.</p>
    <p>It is the NFL’s sec­ond half-time show pro­duc­tion part­ner­ship with hip-hop mogul Jay-Z’s Roc Na­tion.</p>
    <p>Last year, the NFL tapped Jay-Z to steer its mu­si­cal per­for­mances – the half-time show is among pop’s most vis­i­ble gigs – which the league hailed as a move to pro­mote so­cial jus­tice.</p>
    <p>The artist said it would al­low the NFL to ad­vance from protest to ac­tion, af­ter it strug­gled to se­cure per­form­ers last year over the treat­ment of for­mer San Fran­cisco 49ers quar­ter­back Colin Kaeper­nick, whose kneel­ing protests against so­cial in­jus­tice and racial in­equal­ity drew in­ter­na­tional at­ten­tion and con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>But many crit­i­cised Jay-Z’s deal with the NFL, with some call­ing it a “money move”.</p>
    <p>The Weeknd has sup­ported the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment and also do­nated US$200,000 (S$270,000) to Kaeper­nick’s le­gal de­fence ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear how the pan­demic will shift plans for the singer, who in the past has gone for elab­o­rate and high-pro­duc­tion stag­ings.</p>
    <p>NFL com­mis­sioner Roger Good­ell has said “our in­tent is to have as many fans at the Su­per Bowl as can be done safely” for the event slated for Feb 7 in Tampa, Florida.</p>
