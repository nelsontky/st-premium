    <p>LON­DON • When Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son held a video­con­fer­ence with lead­ers of the Euro­pean Union last month, of­fi­cials on both sides came away op­ti­mistic that a deal on their post-Brexit re­la­tion­ship was in sight. That con­fi­dence is evap­o­rat­ing.</p>
    <p>In­for­mal meet­ings between the Bri­tish and EU’s chief ne­go­tia­tors since then have failed to make progress, said peo­ple with knowl­edge of the dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Mr John­son yes­ter­day said Bri­tain will con­tinue to en­gage con­struc­tively with the EU in talks on a fu­ture re­la­tion­ship, but Lon­don is not will­ing to give up its rights as an in­de­pen­dent state.</p>
    <p>“Our po­si­tion on our sovereignt­y, laws and fish­eries is clear, we will not give up our rights as an in­de­pen­dent state,” the spokesman told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to en­gage con­struc­tively with the EU on th­ese key is­sues and will work hard to reach the broad out­line of an agree­ment, but as we have been clear all along, we are not ask­ing for a spe­cial, be­spoke or unique deal.”</p>
    <p>EU chief ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier had sig­nalled the bloc is ready to give ground on the three most contentiou­s top­ics in the ne­go­ti­a­tions: EU ves­sels’ ac­cess to Bri­tish fish­ing waters; how closely Bri­tain will stay aligned to Euro­pean rules on state aid; and what role the Euro­pean Court of Jus­tice will play in polic­ing the pact.</p>
    <p>The EU side is baf­fled that Bri­tain has not shown any in­di­ca­tion of where it is will­ing to com­pro­mise, one of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>Part of Bri­tain’s lack of move­ment can be ex­plained by Lon­don be­liev­ing it has the up­per hand. Not only does Mr John­son ap­pear com­fort­able with cut­ting ties with the EU with­out a deal, Bri­tish of­fi­cials ar­gue that in many ar­eas – on fish­eries, for ex­am­ple – Euro­pean coun­tries will even­tu­ally be­lieve it is bet­ter to swal­low Bri­tain’s hard-line po­si­tion be­cause they would be even worse off than in the event of no deal be­ing reached.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Barnier and Mr John­son’s Europe ad­viser David Frost be­gan their first full round of ne­go­ti­a­tions for six weeks with a din­ner in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain left the EU in Jan­uary and is in a sta­tus quo tran­si­tion pe­riod un­til the end of the year, when some com­pa­nies fear dis­rup­tion if the two sides fail to se­cure a free trade deal.</p>
    <p>The talks, which con­clude at Thurs­day lunchtime, will also cover ar­eas rang­ing from en­ergy to se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion. A fi­nal ne­go­ti­at­ing round is set for the week of Aug 17.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son, mean­while, is fac­ing a re­bel­lion from mem­bers of his Con­ser­va­tive Party seek­ing to amend gov­ern­ment leg­is­la­tion and give Par­lia­ment a veto on new trade deals.</p>
    <p>MP Jonathan Djano­gly, who is head­ing the push for the amend­ment, sug­gested that the gov­ern­ment’s re­luc­tance to give law­mak­ers a say over fu­ture trade deals is at odds with the Leave cam­paign’s prom­ise in the ref­er­en­dum to “take back con­trol”.</p>
