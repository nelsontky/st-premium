    <p>WASH­ING­TON The US gov­ern­ment has an­nounced it would de­lay en­force­ment of a ban on TikTok, say­ing it would com­ply with a court or­der in favour of the Chi­nese-owned so­cial me­dia sen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has in­sisted on the need to ban the fast-grow­ing app, say­ing it has links to the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment through its parent com­pany ByteDance, and that user data could be ob­tained by Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The hit short-form video app – which has some 100 mil­lion users in the United States – was given a re­prieve af­ter the Com­merce De­part­ment said it was hold­ing off on ban­ning it ow­ing to an in­junc­tion by a fed­eral judge is­sued on Oct 30.</p>
    <p>“The de­part­ment is com­ply­ing with the terms of this or­der,” it said in a state­ment on Thurs­day, adding that the ban “will not go into ef­fect pend­ing fur­ther le­gal de­vel­op­ments”.</p>
    <p>The US gov­ern­ment has launched an ap­peal against the judge’s de­ci­sion in the case, which was brought by TikTok in­flu­encers.</p>
    <p>The White House has said TikTok must be­come a US firm con­trolled by Amer­i­can in­vestors to avert a ban.</p>
    <p>But any plan would likely need ap­proval from Bei­jing, which has baulked at giving up con­trol of its so­cial me­dia star.</p>
    <p>China’s Com­merce Min­istry pub­lished new rules in Au­gust that added “civil­ian use” to a list of tech­nolo­gies that are re­stricted for ex­port, which could make it more dif­fi­cult for ByteDance to sell TikTok, which fea­tures clips of ev­ery­thing from dance rou­tines to pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on the re­prieve, TikTok said: “(We) look for­ward to reach­ing a res­o­lu­tion that ad­dresses their se­cu­rity con­cerns, even as we dis­agree with them.”</p>
    <p>ByteDance and TikTok have pro­posed cre­at­ing a new com­pany with IT firm Or­a­cle as a tech­nol­ogy part­ner and re­tail gi­ant Wal­mart as a busi­ness part­ner, but no deal has been con­firmed.</p>
    <p>ByteDance had been given un­til Thurs­day to re­struc­ture own­er­ship of the app in the US to ad­dress na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns, but it filed a pe­ti­tion in a Wash­ing­ton court this week ask­ing for a de­lay.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his aides have claimed TikTok and ByteDance can be used to col­lect data on Amer­i­cans for Chi­nese es­pi­onage, a claim they deny.</p>
