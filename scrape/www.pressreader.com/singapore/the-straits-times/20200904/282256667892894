    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing grew at a slower pace last month on the back of a weaker job mar­ket, but the elec­tron­ics sec­tor stole the show by re­turn­ing to ex­pan­sion­ary mode af­ter con­tract­ing for six straight months.</p>
    <p>Last month’s read­ing of the Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex (PMI) re­leased yes­ter­day came in at 50.1 points, down 0.1 point from July, when it rose by 1.2 points.</p>
    <p>A PMI read­ing over 50 in­di­cates ex­pan­sion, while one be­low 50 shows con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>The elec­tron­ics sec­tor’s PMI rose by 1.4 points to 50.6, the high­est level since Septem­ber 2018, when the read­ing was 51.4.</p>
    <p>Elec­tron­ics last ex­ceeded the 50 thresh­old in Jan­uary this year at 50.1, prior to the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>The Jan­uary ex­pan­sion was pre­ceded by 14 months of con­trac­tion, mainly due to the United StatesChin­a trade war and the slow­down in the Chi­nese econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The man­u­fac­tur­ing PMI in Sin­ga­pore, which is in the midst of its worst re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence, has been on the mend since April, when the PMI dropped to 44.7 – the low­est level since Novem­ber 2008 amid the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) shrank by a record 13.2 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, with the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor con­tract­ing 0.7 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in the same quar­ter, non-oil do­mes­tic ex­ports (Nodx) grew by 6.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan said the mod­est sec­ond-quar­ter drop in man­u­fac­tur­ing, rel­a­tive to GDP, and the surge in Nodx sug­gested eco­nomic growth may have hit a floor and last month’s PMI data backed that view.</p>
    <p>“The ex­pan­sions in both man­u­fac</p>
    <p>tur­ing and elec­tron­ics PMIs sig­nal that a re­cov­ery is tak­ing place, and over­all GDP is ex­pected to im­prove rel­a­tive to the con­trac­tion in the sec­ond quar­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Pur­chas­ing and Ma­te­ri­als Man­age­ment (SIPMM), which com­piles the monthly PMI re­port, said last month’s man­u­fac­tur­ing PMI was aided by more new or­ders and a faster rate of ex­pan­sion in fac­tory out­put.</p>
    <p>The jump in elec­tron­ics PMI was at­trib­uted to first-time ex­pan­sion read­ings for new or­ders and fac­tory out­put.</p>
    <p>The elec­tron­ics in­ven­tory in­dex posted a faster rate of ex­pan­sion but the sec­tor’s em­ploy­ment in­dex posted a slower con­trac­tion, said SIPMM.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee Ju Ye, econ­o­mist at May­bank Kim Eng Se­cu­ri­ties, said elec­tron­ics has out­per­formed other clus­ters in re­cent months, amid re­silient de­mand for semi­con­duc­tors for data centres and cloud ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Ms Sophia Poh, SIPMM vice-pres­i­dent for in­dus­try en­gage­ment and de­vel­op­ment, said: “Au­gust PMI</p>
    <p>read­ings pointed to a sil­ver lin­ing in the elec­tron­ics sec­tor, which ap­peared to pro­vide a needed boost for over­all man­u­fac­tur­ing.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the em­ploy­ment in­dex for man­u­fac­tur­ing PMI con­tracted at a faster rate from the previous month and con­tracted for the sev­enth month in a row.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, OCBC Bank’s head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy, said the weak em­ploy­ment in­dex read­ing in­di­cates that the labour mar­ket re­cov­ery will con­tinue to lag be­hind the over­all eco­nomic re­cov­ery. She said her third-quar­ter GDP growth forecast stands at mi­nus 7.1 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>UOB’s Mr Gan ex­pects full-year GDP to shrink by 5 per cent.</p>
