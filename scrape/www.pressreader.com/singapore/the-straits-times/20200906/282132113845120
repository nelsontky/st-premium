    <p>LOUDEN­VIELLE (France) • There was joy and dis­ap­point­ment for the hosts as Nans Peters won the eighth stage of the Tour de France af­ter a long break­away in the Pyre­nees yes­ter­day, while fel­low French­man Thibaut Pinot as good as lost all hope of win­ning the race.</p>
    <p>Peters took his first ca­reer Tour de France stage win – the 141km moun­tain­ous trek from Caz­eressur-Garonne – af­ter prov­ing to be the strong­est in a 13-rider break­away.</p>
    <p>It was the first Tour stage win for his team AG2R La Mon­di­ale in three years.</p>
    <p>Trek-Se­gafredo’s Toms Sku­jins fin­ished sec­ond and Mo­vis­tar’s Car­los Verona was third. The duo were 47 sec­onds be­hind.</p>
    <p>“I told my­self, be­lieve, be­lieve, be­lieve,” Peters said af­ter solo­ing to the fin­ish in Louden­vielle in just over four hours.</p>
    <p>A French stage win was the tonic home fans needed on a day their best hope to end the coun­try’s 35-year ti­tle drought – Groupa­maFDJ’s 30-year-old Pinot – was dropped on the Port de Bales 41km from the fin­ish as in­juries from an open­ing-day crash took their toll.</p>
    <p>Dutch­man Tom Du­moulin also cracked, while de­fend­ing cham­pion Egan Ber­nal strug­gled on the sec­ond as­cent.</p>
    <p>Bri­ton Adam Yates hung on to the over­all leader’s yel­low jer­sey, man­ag­ing to cross the line with the main con­tenders de­spite be­ing dropped sev­eral times on the as­cent of the Col de Peyre­sourde.</p>
    <p>He leads pre-race favourite Pri­moz Roglic, who looked in con­trol through­out, by three sec­onds and France’s Guil­laume Martin by nine.</p>
    <p>Roglic’s fel­low Slove­nian Tadej Po­gacar, who had lost time on a stage fraught with cross­winds on Fri­day, was the most suc­cess­ful at­tacker. He re­gained 40 sec­onds to move up to ninth place over­all, 48 sec­onds off the pace.</p>
    <p>I knew (Il­nur) Zakarin was stronger than me up the climbs but I never gave up. I con­vinced my­self to not crack. I had seen in the down­hill of Port de Bales that he de­scended like a goat, so I was con­fi­dent to beat him in the fi­nale of the stage.</p>
    <p>NANS PETERS, AG2R La Mon­di­ale rider, who won the eighth stage yes­ter­day, on Il­nur Zakarin, his clos­est chal­lenger as they be­gan their de­scent be­fore end­ing fourth.</p>
