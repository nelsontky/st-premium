    <p>The group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer (CEO) of main­board-listed City De­vel­op­ments Lim­ited’s (CDL) ho­tel arm, Mil­len­nium & Copthorne Ho­tels (M&C), has re­signed after four months in the po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Clarence Tan, 52, will cease to be CEO of M&C from Aug 2. He was ap­pointed on April 2.</p>
    <p>“Mr Tan has shared that he is re­sign­ing in or­der to spend more time with his family,” CDL said on Tues­day evening. “Mov­ing for­ward, he re­mains open to in­ter­est­ing or suit­able op­por­tu­ni­ties that may come along.”</p>
    <p>CDL took M&C pri­vate last year, and the Bri­tish com­pany was sub­se­quently delisted from the Lon­don Stock Ex­change.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan was the first to take the helm after the delist­ing, fol­low­ing the de­par­ture of former M&C group CEO and di­rec­tor Jen­nifer Fox in Septem­ber 2018 after three months in the job. No rea­son was given for Ms Fox’s move.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said back in March that he saw “a sig­nif­i­cant op­por­tu­nity to re­shape M&C’s strate­gies and re­po­si­tion the busi­ness” amid op­er­at­ing chal­lenges and un­cer­tainty brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In May, M&C cut its global head­count by 8 per cent and fur­loughed an­other 30 per cent of staff in its owned-and-man­aged ho­tel port­fo­lio. Se­nior man­age­ment and ex­ec­u­tives in M&C have, since April 1, also ac­cepted salary cuts of up to 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>Shares of CDL closed down 14 cents or 1.65 per cent to $8.36 yesterday.</p>
