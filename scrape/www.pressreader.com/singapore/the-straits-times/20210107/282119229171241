    <p>A fire broke out at a third-floor of­fice in Kwong Wai Shiu Hos­pi­tal (KWSH) in Seran­goon Road on Tues­day night, but no one was in­jured.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) said that it was alerted to the in­ci­dent at about 8.25pm and the fire was ex­tin­guished us­ing a wa­ter jet.</p>
    <p>There were no in­juries re­ported, and no evac­u­a­tion was or­dered.</p>
    <p>SCDF is still in­ves­ti­gat­ing the cause of the fire.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on Tues­day night, KWSH said the fire hap­pened at Block A of the hos­pi­tal in the HCA Hospice Care of­fice.</p>
    <p>No one was in the of­fice at the time.</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal’s nurs­ing home res­i­dents are housed in a sep­a­rate block. Its wards have been checked and no res­i­dents were af­fected by the fire, added KWSH.</p>
    <p>In an up­date to the post in the early hours yes­ter­day, the hos­pi­tal said that due to the fire, HCA’s Day Hospice in Seran­goon would be closed yes­ter­day.</p>
