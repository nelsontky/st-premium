    <p>BAGH­DAD • Thousands of Iraqi mourn­ers yes­ter­day con­demned the “Amer­i­can oc­cu­piers”, one year af­ter a US drone strike killed Iran’s revered com­man­der Qassem Soleimani and his Iraqi lieu­tenant Abu Mahdi al-Muhan­dis.</p>
    <p>The an­niver­sary of their deaths in Bagh­dad – which brought arch enemies the United States and Iran to the brink of war – was also marked in Iran and by sup­port­ers in Syria, Le­banon, Ye­men and else­where.</p>
    <p>The lead-up to the com­mem­o­ra­tions of the Shi’ite Mus­lim com­man­ders has again height­ened re­gional ten­sions in the weeks be­fore US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who or­dered the killings, leaves the White House.</p>
    <p>In Iraq, the pow­er­ful pro-Ira­nian Hashed al-Shaabi para­mil­i­tary net­work, which Mr Muhan­dis com­manded, led the som­bre and an­gry vig­ils for him and Ma­jor-Gen­eral Soleimani, who headed the for­eign op­er­a­tions arm of Iran’s Is­lamic Rev­o­lu­tion­ary Guard Corps.</p>
    <p>Thousands of black-clad mourn­ers con­verged on Satur­day night at the spot near Bagh­dad’s in­ter­na­tional air­port where the United States hit the two ve­hi­cles and killed Maj-Gen Soleimani, Mr Muhan­dis and eight other men.</p>
    <p>By can­dle­light, they hon­oured their “mar­tyrs” and con­demned the Amer­i­can “great Satan” at the site where nearby walls are still pock­marked by shrap­nel.</p>
    <p>“We tell Amer­ica and the enemies of Is­lam that they can in­flict the great­est sac­ri­fices on us, but we will con­tinue to re­sist de­spite the blood­shed,” said Hashed sup­porter Batul Na­j­jar.</p>
    <p>The Hashed – fac­tions of which Wash­ing­ton has blamed for rocket strikes against its em­bassy and troops in Iraq – has in­creas­ingly chal­lenged Iraqi Prime Min­is­ter Mustafa al-Kad­himi, whom it ac­cuses of hav­ing helped plot the drone strikes.</p>
    <p>This has brought to the boil once more ten­sions in the war-bat­tered and po­lit­i­cally frag­ile coun­try which the US in­vaded in 2003, and which is strug­gling with an eco­nomic cri­sis amid low oil prices and the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With more mass gath­er­ings planned yes­ter­day at Bagh­dad’s cen­tral Tahrir Square, Mr Ahmed As­sadi, one of the l ead­ers of Hashed’s par­lia­men­tary bloc, vowed: “Abu Mahdi al-Muhan­dis, we will go out by the mil­lions to bran­dish your por­trait on Tahrir.”</p>
    <p>Gi­ant posters of Maj-Gen Soleimani and Mr Muhan­dis were hung up above the iconic square – which in late 2019 be­came the cen­tre of large anti-gov­ern­ment protests – from an aban­doned build­ing.</p>
    <p>Amid the ten­sions, Iraqis, and many in the wider re­gion, are ner­vously watch­ing for any signs of es­ca­la­tion be­fore Mr Trump leaves the White House on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump con­fronted decades­old foe Iran by with­draw­ing in 2018 from its nu­clear deal with world pow­ers and launch­ing a “max­i­mum pres­sure” cam­paign to fur­ther eco­nom­i­cally pun­ish and iso­late the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The out­go­ing Pres­i­dent re­cently tweeted that the US was hear­ing the “chat­ter of ad­di­tional at­tacks against Amer­i­cans in Iraq”, and warned that “if one Amer­i­can is killed, I will hold Iran re­spon­si­ble. Think it over”.</p>
    <p>In re­cent days, US B-52 bombers have flown across the re­gion for the sec­ond time in less than a month but, in what some read as a sign of de-es­ca­la­tion, Wash­ing­ton has also re­port­edly or­dered its Nimitz air­craft car­rier to leave the Gulf.</p>
    <p>Iran’s Rev­o­lu­tion­ary Guards Corps chief Hos­sein Salami vowed on Satur­day to re­spond to any “ac­tion the en­emy takes”, as he vis­ited a strate­gic Gulf is­land.</p>
    <p>“We would re­spond with a re­cip­ro­cal, de­ci­sive and strong blow to what­ever ac­tion the en­emy would take against us,” he warned.</p>
    <p>Iran and the US – bit­ter foes since the 1979 Ira­nian Is­lamic revo­lu­tion and the US em­bassy hostage cri­sis in Te­heran – have twice come to the brink of war since June 2019, most re­cently af­ter Maj-Gen Soleimani’s killing.</p>
    <p>Iran’s For­eign Min­is­ter Mo­ham­mad Javad Zarif last Thurs­day ac­cused Mr Trump of aim­ing to fab­ri­cate a “pre­text for war”, af­ter the US Pres­i­dent blamed Te­heran for a Dec 20 rocket strike on the US em­bassy in Bagh­dad.</p>
    <p>In the war of words, Mr Zarif on Satur­day also claimed that in Iraq, “Is­raeli agent-provo­ca­teurs are plot­ting at­tacks against Amer­i­cans (to put) Trump in a bind with a fake ca­sus belli”.</p>
