    <p>A woman whose ini­tial 20-month jail term for maid abuse was cut to eight months last year had her sen­tence in­creased to 14 months by the Court of Ap­peal yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Suzanna Bong Sim Swan, 48, was found guilty of one charge of caus­ing hurt to Ms Than Than Soe on May 17, 2015, by hit­ting the maid’s left cheek re­peat­edly with a glass bot­tle con­tain­ing med­i­cated oil.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the apex court said it was im­por­tant to con­sider all the cir­cum­stances of an of­fence to as­sess the level of the of­fender’s wrong­do­ing and the ex­tent of the vic­tim’s suf­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>In this case, Bong’s acts took place in the con­text of a sus­tained pat­tern of abuse for a pe­riod of al­most two years, dur­ing which the do­mes­tic worker from Myan­mar was sub­jected to phys­i­cal abuse and op­pres­sive work­ing con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Bong reg­u­larly as­saulted the maid – who was 27 when she started her em­ploy­ment in 2013 – and of­ten punched the vic­tim in the eye or face. Bong also rubbed curry on the vic­tim’s face for not heat­ing it up for din­ner, pulled her hair and slapped her.</p>
    <p>About 10 months af­ter ar­riv­ing in Sin­ga­pore, the vic­tim’s eye­sight be­gan to de­te­ri­o­rate. She told her em­ployer about it but Bong dis­missed it.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim called the police af­ter Bong as­saulted her with the glass bot­tle, and was later found to be legally blind in her left eye.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Bong was sen­tenced to 20 months’ jail by a dis­trict court and or­dered to pay com­pen­sa­tion of $38,540.40 to the vic­tim.</p>
    <p>Bong ap­pealed to the High Court, which re­duced her sen­tence to eight months and the com­pen­sa­tion sum to $1,000.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chua Lee Ming said then that there was no ev­i­dence that Bong’s acts on May 17, 2015 caused the vic­tim’s in­juries, which might have been caused by pre­vi­ous in­stances of abuse for which Bong was not charged.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion then brought the case to the Court of Ap­peal to de­ter­mine ques­tions of law that arose in the case.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, the Court of Ap­peal ruled that if there has been a pat­tern of abuse, it would be wrong to view the charge in iso­la­tion be­cause that would give a false as­sess­ment of the suf­fer­ing of the vic­tim and of the of­fender’s cul­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the apex court, com­pris­ing Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon and Judges of Ap­peal An­drew Phang and Tay Yong Kwang, in­creased Bong’s jail term to 14 months.</p>
    <p>She was granted a one-week de­fer­ment and was or­dered to start serv­ing her sen­tence on Sept 30.</p>
