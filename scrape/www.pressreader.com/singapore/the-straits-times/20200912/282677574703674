    <p>My plant is placed at the edge of the liv­ing room, near the bal­cony. It pro­duces new leaves con­stantly, but the edges even­tu­ally turn brown. I wa­ter the plant thor­oughly once a week. I tried do­ing it twice weekly but see wa­ter col­lect­ing on the plate it is placed on.</p>
    <p>See Soo Eng</p>
    <p>The plant is com­monly called the Sweet Prayer Plant and its botan­i­cal name is Thau­ma­to­coc­cus daniel­lii. The brown edges on the leaves in­di­cate that the plant may be dam­aged by salt burn. Dam­aged leaves will not re­cover and will be taken over by new leaves over time.</p>
    <p>How long has the plant been grow­ing in the cur­rent pot of soil? Long-term grow­ing in the same con­tainer of grow­ing me­dia can lead to ex­cess fertiliser salt build-up. You can flush the soil with wa­ter to re­move some of these salts and repot the plant in fresh grow­ing me­dia.</p>
    <p>Take care not to dis­turb the root ball too much as that can lead to trans­plant shock.</p>
    <p>Also, prayer plants in gen­eral are sen­si­tive to flu­o­ride found in Sin­ga­pore’s tap wa­ter. Some gar­den­ers col­lect rain­wa­ter to wa­ter their prayer plants to avoid the oc­cur­rence of this is­sue.</p>
