    <p>De­vel­oper Kep­pel Land’s car­bon emis­sion in­ten­sity last year was about 22 per cent be­low that of 2010 – beat­ing its tar­get of a 16 per cent re­duc­tion by 2020.</p>
    <p>The firm aims to achieve a 40 per cent cut from 2010 lev­els by 2030, it noted in a sus­tain­abil­ity re­port out to­day that also out­lined the eco­nomic, en­vi­ron­men­tal and so­cial im­pact of its build­ings and ac­tiv­i­ties across Sin­ga­pore and abroad.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Land has also aligned its strat­egy with six of the United Na­tions’ 17 Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Goals.</p>
    <p>Its re­port noted that it has gar­nered 84 Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity (BCA) Green Mark awards for its prop­er­ties in Sin­ga­pore and over­seas.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Bay Tower is also the first com­mer­cial project here to use re­new­able en­ergy to power all its op­er­a­tions, in­clud­ing ten­ant of­fices.</p>
    <p>The to­tal es­ti­mated re­duc­tion in en­ergy con­sump­tion from all its Green Mark-awarded projects, when fully com­pleted, will be over 220 mil­lion kwh a year.</p>
    <p>This is equiv­a­lent to the amount of en­ergy re­quired to power around 50,000 homes in Sin­ga­pore for a year, and trans­lates to an­nual cost sav­ings of around $55 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Swee Yiow said in the re­port that the com­pany will con­tinue to sharpen its fo­cus on in­no­va­tion to pro­vide sus­tain­able so­lu­tions that will con­trib­ute to cli­mate ac­tion.</p>
    <p>He noted that the de­sign and use of of­fices and homes will evolve in the wake of the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has brought to the fore the im­por­tance of smart, flex­i­ble and sus­tain­able de­signs, as well as build­ing fea­tures that im­prove health.</p>
    <p>“These are at­tributes that Kep­pel Land’s de­vel­op­ments have long been known for, and we will con­tinue to seize busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties in smart, green de­vel­op­ments of the fu­ture,” Mr Tan added.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has set a tar­get to in­vest an av­er­age of 2 per cent of its an­nual profit to sup­port sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment by 2030.</p>
    <p>Last year, it launched an ini­tia­tive to in­vest $500,000 a year in seed fund­ing for in­no­va­tive ideas de­vised by its staff.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Land staff also clocked up about 8,050 vol­un­teer hours through com­mu­nity outreach ac­tiv­i­ties and spon­sored pro­grammes here and over­seas, the re­port noted.</p>
    <p>The projects which staff par­tic­i­pated in lo­cally in­clude the BCAKep­pel Land pub­lic outreach pro­gramme GreenSeeds, a three-year ini­tia­tive com­pleted last year that in­volved nine schools cre­at­ing green spa­ces within their com­pounds as part of ef­forts to raise aware­ness of con­ser­va­tion and re­source ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>The firm also worked with part­ners in China to pro­vide teach­ing re­sources to schools in im­pov­er­ished ar­eas in Yun­nan prov­ince and con­tin­ued its part­ner­ship with the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Foun­da­tion for the sec­ond phase of a mo­bile li­brary scheme in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
