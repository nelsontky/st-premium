    <p>Viet­namese tourists rushed to leave Danang city yes­ter­day as the govern­ment im­posed curbs there to con­tain fresh com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion of Covid-19. With the source of in­fec­tion still a mys­tery, the po­lice have stepped up mass in­spec­tion ef­forts to un­cover il­le­gal en­trants.</p>
    <p>Viet­namese tourists rushed to leave the cen­tral city of Danang as the govern­ment im­posed stay­home mea­sures to con­tain com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion of Covid-19, with 11 new cases con­firmed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With the source of in­fec­tion still a mys­tery, po­lice have stepped up mass in­spec­tion ef­forts to un­cover il­le­gal en­trants.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam’s civil avi­a­tion au­thor­ity had ear­lier given air­lines the green light to boost ca­pac­ity and in­crease the fre­quency of flights from Danang to help evac­u­ate trav­ellers among the 80,000 peo­ple es­ti­mated to be stranded in the city.</p>
    <p>Mr Dinh Viet Thang, di­rec­tor­gen­eral of Civil Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity of Viet­nam, said: “Tourists who are stuck in Danang might run out of money and places to stay. If we do not solve this prob­lem, more prob­lems may arise.”</p>
    <p>Un­til last Satur­day, Viet­nam was set to cross 100 days with­out any lo­cal trans­mis­sions, af­ter emerg­ing from a na­tion­wide lock­down. With the border still largely closed to foreign vis­i­tors, the coun­try was also in the mid­dle of a lo­cal tourism drive to re­vive the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But a new case in the bustling coastal city of Danang con­firmed last Satur­day – fol­lowed quickly by an­other three over the week­end in the same city and nearby Quang Ngai province – sparked an ex­o­dus of lo­cal trav­ellers not want­ing to get caught out by a lock­down.</p>
    <p>Most of the 11 new cases con­firmed yes­ter­day were ei­ther staff or pa­tients at Danang gen­eral hos­pi­tal, which has been iso­lated.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials ear­lier blamed the new in­fec­tions on a new, more con­ta­gious strain of the coro­n­avirus that had not been de­tected in the coun­try be­fore.</p>
    <p>For the next two weeks, Danang res­i­dents have to stay home un­less head­ing to work in es­sen­tial jobs, buy­ing food or han­dling emer­gen­cies. They can gather in groups of no more than two in pub­lic. Trans­porta­tion to and from Danang, as well as taxi ser­vices have been sus­pended. Su­per­mar­kets and mar­kets re­main open.</p>
    <p>Fes­ti­vals, re­li­gious cer­e­monies and sports events have al­ready been sus­pended and non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses, like bars, closed.</p>
    <p>“We have to be res­o­lute, oth­er­wise we will fail in this anti-pan­demic cam­paign,” Prime Min­is­ter Nguyen Xuan Phuc was quoted by me­dia out­let Vnex­press say­ing.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties else­where are on alert for ar­rivals from Danang. In Ho Chi Minh City, health of­fi­cials de­clared that any­one who ar­rived in Danang from the start of the month would be sub­ject to com­pul­sory health dec­la­ra­tion and Covid-19 test­ing. In the north­ern prov­inces of Hai Phong and Bac Giang, a 14-day quar­an­tine is ap­pli­ca­ble to any­one who has re­turned from Danang since July 13.</p>
    <p>There have been larger knock-on ef­fects, with the sus­pen­sion of do­mes­tic foot­ball league matches un­til fur­ther no­tice.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, po­lice try­ing to stop the risk of im­ported cases have found dozens of Chi­nese na­tion­als who en­tered Viet­nam illegally and evaded its manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine over the past month. Last Satur­day, po­lice ar­rested a Chi­nese man for al­legedly be­ing part of a ring that smug­gled Chi­nese na­tion­als into Danang and nearby Quang Nam province.</p>
    <p>Since the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic, Viet­nam has recorded 431 cases of in­fec­tions and no deaths.</p>
