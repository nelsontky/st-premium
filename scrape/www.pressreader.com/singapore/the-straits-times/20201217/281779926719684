    <p>• Sup­port­ers of hard­line In­done­sian cleric Rizieq Shi­hab protested out­side po­lice head­quar­ters in Sam­pang re­gency, East Java, yes­ter­day, to de­mand jus­tice for six of their group’s mem­bers who were killed in a shoot-out with the po­lice and for the re­lease of their leader.</p>
    <p>Rizieq, who heads the con­tro­ver­sial Islamic De­fend­ers Front (FPI), has been de­tained since last Satur­day at the Metro Jaya re­gional po­lice head­quar­ters just out­side Jakarta.</p>
    <p>He is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for breach­ing coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions by hold­ing events that drew thou­sands of fol­low­ers in the city.</p>
    <p>In Sam­pang yes­ter­day, sev­eral dozen pro­test­ers gath­ered out­side the sta­tion to chant slo­gans and lis</p>
    <p>ten to speeches by rally or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>Many were with­out face masks and did not ob­serve so­cial dis­tanc­ing as ad­vised by the gov­ern­ment amid a pan­demic that has logged nearly 530,000 cases in the vast ar­chi­pel­ago and killed more than 19,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“We are at the Sam­pang po­lice sta­tion to de­mand jus­tice, for po­lice to com­plete in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the killing of FPI cadres in Jakarta,” a</p>
    <p>rally or­gan­iser, Mahrus, was quoted as say­ing by lo­cal news me­dia.</p>
    <p>He added that the pro­test­ers also de­manded the im­me­di­ate re­lease of the cleric.</p>
    <p>Last week, the po­lice shot dead six of Rizieq’s fol­low­ers in a high­way shoot-out as his sup­port­ers ac­com­pa­nied him to a func­tion in a con­voy of ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said those killed were car­ry­ing weapons in­clud­ing pis­tols,</p>
    <p>which has been de­nied by the FPI.</p>
    <p>Be­fore his ar­rest, the 55-year-old preacher had been called in by the po­lice sev­eral times to give a state­ment for al­low­ing thou­sands of his sup­port­ers to gather at the Jakarta air­port and in a gath­er­ing at his house last month, soon af­ter he re­turned from a three-year self-im­posed ex­ile in Saudi Ara­bia.</p>
    <p>But he had man­aged to avoid them un­til his ar­rest last Satur­day.</p>
