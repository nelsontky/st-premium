    <p>An­other wave of opin­ion polls re­leased on Sun­day showed vot­ers l ean­ing to­wards Demo­crat Joe Bi­den over Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in Michi­gan, Flor­ida and Ari­zona, three key states won by Mr Trump in 2016.</p>
    <p>Han­dling of the coro­n­avirus out­break spells trou­ble for Mr Trump, poll­sters say, as US cases now ex­ceed four mil­lion and deaths are over 146,000. The US elec­tion is around a hun­dred days away but early vot­ing will start i n some states as soon as five weeks’ time.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is ahead in Ari­zona by 49 per cent to 45 per cent among reg­is­tered vot­ers, ac­cord­ing to a CNN poll con­ducted by SSRS, a sur­vey and mar­ket re­search firm.</p>
    <p>An­other Ari­zona poll re­leased on Sun­day, from NBC News/Marist, put Mr Bi­den up by 5 per­cent­age points, 50 per cent to 45 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ari­zona vot­ers said Mr Bi­den would do a bet­ter job han­dling the Covid-19 out­break and race re­la­tions. Mr Trump’s sup­port­ers were more en­thu­si­as­tic than Mr Bi­den’s, though – a fac­tor that the Pres­i­dent and his re­elec­tion cam­paign have em­pha­sised.</p>
    <p>Democrats also en­joy a wide ad­van­tage in Ari­zona’s Se­nate con­test be­tween in­cum­bent Repub­li­can Martha McSally and chal­lenger Mark Kelly. Mr Kelly, a Nasa astro­naut and hus­band of former Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Gabrielle Gif­fords, had a 12-point lead over Ms McSally, 53 per cent to 41 per cent, af­ter hav­ing a 3-point edge in March, NBC said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump won Michi­gan in 2016 by a nar­row 10,704-vote mar­gin. The new CNN poll put Mr Bi­den on top there by 52 per cent to 40 per cent. An­other poll out on Sun­day, from CBS/YouGov, showed Mr Bi­den lead­ing by 6 points.</p>
    <p>Some 70 per cent of Michi­gan’s reg­is­tered vot­ers re­ported dis­lik­ing how the Pres­i­dent han­dles him­self per­son­ally. Mr Bi­den had mixed scores on that mea­sure him­self but did bet­ter than Mr Trump by dou­ble dig­its.</p>
    <p>Some sur­veys also showed that when both can­di­dates were dis­liked, more vot­ers were lean­ing to­wards Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>CBS showed Mr Trump up by 1 point over Mr Bi­den in Ohio af­ter win­ning the state by 8 points in 2016. Much of Mr Bi­den’s sup­port in Michi­gan and Ohio came from peo­ple who are mainly vot­ing against Mr Trump rather than for Mr Bi­den, CBS said.</p>
    <p>In Flor­ida, Mr Bi­den is ahead 51 per cent to 46 per cent, ac­cord­ing to the CNN sur­vey. Like Ari­zona, Flor­ida is deal­ing with a rapid rise in the level of coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>The RealClearP­ol­i­tics sum­mary of ma­jor polls, in­clud­ing those re­leased on Sun­day, shows Mr Bi­den up by 4 points in Ari­zona, 8.4 points in Michi­gan, and 7.8 points in Flor­ida.</p>
