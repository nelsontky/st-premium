    <p>SEOUL • Oil edged higher ahead of a re­sump­tion of Opec+ talks that were un­ex­pect­edly sus­pended due to a dis­agree­ment over whether to raise out­put in Fe­bru­ary as the coro­n­avirus con­tin­ues to surge.</p>
    <p>Fu­tures in New York gained to­wards US$48 a bar­rel af­ter drop­ping the most in two weeks on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions were to restart yes­ter­day, af­ter a ma­jor­ity of mem­bers, in­clud­ing Saudi Ara­bia, op­posed Rus­sia’s pro­posal for an­other sup­ply hike.</p>
    <p>The talks are hap­pen­ing against a shaky short-term de­mand back­drop. Eng­land has been or­dered into a third lock­down un­til midFe­bru­ary, Ger­many is set to ex­tend its curbs and Ja­pan is con­sid­er­ing an­other state of emer­gency for the Tokyo area.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Asian re­fin­ers will not be get­ting into long-term sup­ply con­tracts for fuel sales this year, a sign that the re­gion’s en­ergy con­sump­tion re­cov­ery is far from cer­tain, although a cold snap in the northern hemi­sphere is aid­ing de­mand for heat­ing fu­els.</p>
    <p>Crude had risen to near US$50 a bar­rel ear­lier on Mon­day, aided by a weak dol­lar.</p>
    <p>The early stages of Covid-19 vac­cine roll­outs have stoked op­ti­mism that de­mand will re­bound with the global econ­omy, and oil has emerged as a trade to hedge in­fla­tion. But with so many mo­bil­ity curbs, the threat to con­sump­tion re­mains sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>“There are not many places where we are see­ing a re­lax­ation of re­stric­tions,” said ING Group’s head of com­modi­ties strat­egy War­ren Pat­ter­son. “They have lit­tle op­tion but to main­tain cur­rent cuts.”</p>
    <p>Rus­sia and Saudi Ara­bia’s ini­tial</p>
    <p>po­si­tions i n the Opec+ sup­ply talks were di­a­met­ri­cally op­posed, with Riyadh ar­gu­ing to re­scind the 500,000-bar­rel a day sup­ply in­crease this month and Moscow want­ing a hike of t he same amount, del­e­gates said.</p>
    <p>The Saudis later in­di­cated that rolling over cur­rent out­put lev­els into Fe­bru­ary would be ac­cept­able, they said.</p>
    <p>Moscow ap­pears to be out­num</p>
    <p>bered but the al­liance re­quires con­sen­sus be­fore con­clud­ing talks.</p>
    <p>The dis­cus­sions come at a time when oil de­mand is go­ing to get worse be­fore it gets bet­ter, En­ergy As­pects co-founder Am­rita Sen said in a Bloomberg TV in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Iran, mean­while, seized a South Korean-flagged oil tanker in the Strait of Hor­muz on Mon­day, hours be­fore say­ing it would step up its nu­clear ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
