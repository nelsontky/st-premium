    <p>I j ust placed a $12,000 wa­ger against the Covid-19 virus.</p>
    <p>Yes, the pan­demic is far from over. But I refuse to imag­ine that the world’s bor­ders will re­main tightly closed for an­other 12 months, with leisure travel non-ex­is­tent.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine is around the corner while travel bubbles will con­tinue to brew. The Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong air travel bub­ble was post­poned two days ago, but it is not fully de­flated yet.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, air­fares are avail­able at bar­gain prices, paired with favourable book­ing terms and con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>So, I took the plunge and bought four air tick­ets for travel for next year. Here is why I have fig­ured that the odds are in my favour.</p>
    <p>LOW­EST FARES IN HALF A DECADE</p>
    <p>In­ter­net searches con­ducted ear­lier this month show air­fares for early next year go­ing at bar­gain prices, com­pared with the prepan­demic days last year. (The global travel in­dus­try started to fal­ter from mid-Jan­uary this year. In this light, Jan­uary 2019 is a bet­ter bench­mark for price com­par­isons).</p>
    <p>Global travel search engine Skyscan­ner’s data, at the point of writ­ing, showed sav­ings of up to 51 per cent on some routes for air­fares for Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary next year, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year and in 2018 (see C2).</p>
    <p>“Three per­sons can fly for the cost of two per­sons now,” says Mr S.H. Lim, a tick­et­ing agent with a lead­ing out­bound op­er­a­tor with 20 years’ ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Long-haul fares, in par­tic­u­lar to Europe, plunged be­tween 15 per cent and 25 per cent. Re­gional mid-haul flights to Ja­pan and</p>
    <p>South Korea are good deals too.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness class cab­ins have be­come more af­ford­able. For ex­am­ple, Turk­ish Air­lines of­fers busi­ness class from Sin­ga­pore to Lon­don – tran­sit via Is­tan­bul – for only $2,595 (see ta­ble on Cheaper Flights From Sin­ga­pore). Prepan­demic, this price hardly got people be­yond Asia in busi­ness class.</p>
    <p>Na­tional car­rier Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) of­fers round-trip busi­ness class flights to Tokyo for $3,000 – a sharp con­trast to the $5,500 I usu­ally forked out on that pop­u­lar sec­tor. Pro tips:</p>
    <p>• Fly busi­ness class for big sav­ings.</p>
    <p>• Check up­dates on the air­line’s fi­nan­cial sta­tus. Avoid air­lines un­der fi­nan­cial re­struc­tur­ing or in dire cash-flow sit­u­a­tions. Com­pet­ing car­ri­ers, with a tran­sit into their hubs, price their tick­ets at al­most half of SIA’s di­rect flights. But be mind­ful that the ar­rival des­ti­na­tion’s bor­der en­try rules may be dif­fer­ent for tran­sit flights.</p>
    <p>GET A FREE SEC­TOR AND EVEN PAY LESS</p>
    <p>My de­fault car­rier is SIA, given its loy­alty pro­gramme and be­cause my home base is Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>For years, my favourite travel hack was to snag a free tag-on flight.</p>
    <p>Now, cou­pled with low fares, this trick has mor­phed into: fly far­ther yet pay less.</p>
    <p>A re­turn SIA busi­ness class ticket for early Fe­bru­ary next year from Sin­ga­pore to Tokyo costs $2,938 (see ta­ble on Fly Far­ther And Pay Less). But if I book­end the front and back of this itin­er­ary with an ex­tra Asean des­ti­na­tion such as Bangkok, the fare drops to $2,173.</p>
    <p>This sav­ings of $765 can buy a five-night stay at the Grand Hy­att Bangkok, lots of happy hours at my favourite Thai mas­sage haven and serv­ings of Miche­lin-starred Jay Fai’s crab omelette.</p>
    <p>Over the past five years, I have used this Bangkok-Sin­ga­pore-Ja­pan hack half a dozen times and can­not re­call such low busi­ness fares.</p>
    <p>An­other tag-on: Add a Ho Chi Minh City sec­tor to Sin­ga­pore and on­wards to Paris on SIA and there is an eye-pop­ping fare saving of $1,479 on busi­ness class and $88 on econ­omy fares, com­pared with an itin­er­ary that orig­i­nates from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on fares and routes, the sav­ings can run into thou­sands of dol­lars for fam­i­lies or big groups.</p>
    <p>These Asean des­ti­na­tions are a short hop away, ser­viced by fre­quent in­ex­pen­sive flights.</p>
    <p>For those with spare time or have a flex­i­ble sched­ule, this is a free tag-on hol­i­day. Stopovers in Sin­ga­pore are also per­mit­ted, sub­ject to fare rules.</p>
    <p>No, nei­ther the air­fare wiz­ards of SIA nor its al­go­rithms got their per­mu­ta­tions wrong.</p>
    <p>Be­ing the for­eign car­rier in those des­ti­na­tions, SIA needs to com­pete with the na­tional car­rier there. Con­versely, SIA com­mands a pre­mium for flights orig­i­nat­ing from its home base of Sin­ga­pore. Pro tips:</p>
    <p>• Select tag-on flight sec­tors from</p>
    <p>coun­tries with good sched­ules.</p>
    <p>• Dif­fer­ent “start and end” cities are per­mit­ted. For ex­am­ple,</p>
    <p>I can com­mence my SIA itin­er­ary from Bangkok to Europe (via Sin­ga­pore) and end my re­turn jour­ney in Phuket, so long as it in­volves the SIA group for the same coun­try.</p>
    <p>• Open jaw sec­tors are per­mit­ted, pro­vided the sec­tor is from the same zone. For ex­am­ple, the SIA flight may com­mence from Kuala Lumpur (via Sin­ga­pore) to Paris – but the re­turn route is from Munich in­stead. Such itin­er­ar­ies pro­vide va­ri­ety and avoid back-track­ing.</p>
    <p>FLEX­I­BIL­ITY IS KEY, BUT KNOW THE RULES</p>
    <p>“No­body will buy a ticket to­day if there is no flex­i­bil­ity,” says Mr Wong S.H., a travel in­dus­try vet­eran with 40 years’ ex­pe­ri­ence. The ic­ing is the slew of un­prece­dented flex­i­ble tick­et­ing terms.</p>
    <p>To en­tice trav­ellers to buy tick­ets be­fore Dec 31 this year, air­lines dan­gle free changes on dates, re-rout­ing, re­funds and travel cred­its for fu­ture travel.</p>
    <p>Each car­rier has its set of terms and con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Most air­lines group their fares into three cat­e­gories, start­ing with the low­est, most re­stric­tive fare – in both econ­omy and busi­ness classes – be­ing non-re­fund­able. The other two higher-fare gen­res al­low re­funds for a fee.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of fare types, all tick­ets are valid for a year.</p>
    <p>Among the most gen­er­ous is Qatar Air­ways, which of­fers ticket va­lid­ity for two years; un­lim­ited changes un­til Dec 31 next year; ex­change for travel voucher with bonus; full re­fund for flight can­cel­la­tions by the air­line; and swop­ping the ticket for air miles.</p>
    <p>I bought the low­est-tier non­re­fund­able SIA busi­ness class ticket to Ja­pan for travel next Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>For me, Ja­pan is a yearly foodie pil­grim­age and I am bet­ting against the pos­si­bil­ity the coun­try will be shut­tered for an­other year. If things are still sketchy come Fe­bru­ary, I can al­ways push back the travel dates.</p>
    <p>Pro tips:</p>
    <p>• Check the fine print.</p>
    <p>• Buy non-re­fund­able tick­ets to your favourite des­ti­na­tions or a must-do trip. But fret not as non-re­fund­able tick­ets al­low a re­book­ing for a new itin­er­ary or date, sub­ject to fare dif­fer­ences and fees.</p>
    <p>• For trips that are less cer­tain, opt for re­fund­able tick­ets. These cost a few hun­dred dol­lars more, with re­fund ad­min­is­tra­tive fees, but you get the cash back im­me­di­ately. I would opt for re­fund­able tick­ets if they are high-value fares.</p>
    <p>FRE­QUENT CHANGES ARE COSTLY: RE­QUEST AN OPEN-DATED TICKET</p>
    <p>For tick­ets bought be­fore Dec 31 this year, SIA of­fers a sin­gle com­pli­men­tary re­book­ing for travel next year. Fees for sub­se­quent re­book­ings will cost be­tween $25 and $340, de­pend­ing on fare type and cabin class.</p>
    <p>How­ever, com­peti­tors – such as Cathay Pa­cific, Qatar Air­ways and Turk­ish Air­lines – of­fer un­lim­ited changes un­til end-De­cem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>Given the stiff com­pe­ti­tion, in­dus­try ob­servers say SIA is likely to of­fer some match-up in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, SIA cited “com­mer­cial sen­si­tiv­ity” and de­clined to pro­vide more de­tails on its fu­ture plans.</p>
    <p>Pro tips:</p>
    <p>• Fre­quent changes can be costly. My ticket is based on my most likely travel date to min­imise the chance of an aborted trip. If the orig­i­nal de­par­ture date is called off and there is un­cer­tainty ahead, I will re­quest to amend the ticket to an open date. This is free.</p>
    <p>• When my travel dates are firm, I will lock in the new dates and have a ticket reis­sued. This qual­i­fies for the one-time com­pli­men­tary change, sub­ject to any fare dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>EX­TEND­ING THE USE OF</p>
    <p>YOUR TICKET BE­YOND A YEAR</p>
    <p>Though tick­ets are valid for a year, there is a trick to ex­tend its mone­tary life­span.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the one-year ex­piry, a ticket may be reis­sued with a new itin­er­ary or dif­fer­ent fare type. The reis­sued ticket re­ceives a new life­span of 12 months. You can reis­sue again and again, but there are re­book­ing fees each time.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong does not fore­see in­ter­na­tional travel re­turn­ing to nor­mal next year.</p>
    <p>“Maybe in two years’ time, it would be pos­si­ble to ex­tend in a big­ger way,” he said at a vir­tual event as­so­ci­ated with the Asi­aPa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion (Apec) group­ing last Thursday.</p>
    <p>Still, my ticket punt lies in my faith that leisure travel will re­turn.</p>
    <p>Fares will sky­rocket when­ever a travel re­stric­tion eases or as travel con­fi­dence picks up.</p>
    <p>The re­cent slew of pos­i­tive vac­cine news is like a shot in the arm for me – I ended up buy­ing tick­ets to the United States and Europe for sum­mer/au­tumn next year, in ad­di­tion to my orig­i­nal plan for a Ja­pan trip.</p>
    <p>I am sure SIA will ap­pre­ci­ate my ticket pur­chases more than a din­ing ticket in its parked air­craft.</p>

    <p>Pre-pan­demic, John Tan, a for­mer jour­nal­ist, had av­er­aged some 70 flights a year over the past decade. His most ex­pen­sive ticket was a round-the-world Star Al­liance busi­ness class fare, which cost more than $16,000. But his most mem­o­rable was a no-frills $18 Ryanair flight from Bucharest to Rome.</p>
