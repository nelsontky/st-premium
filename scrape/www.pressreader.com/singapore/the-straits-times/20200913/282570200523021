    <p>As if fight­ing the virus were not bad enough, Covid-19 pa­tients have to con­tend with los­ing their sense of smell and taste too.</p>
    <p>This got a group of chefs think­ing of new ways to make their food ap­petis­ing. They work in three gov­ern­ment hos­pi­tals – Alexan­dra Hos­pi­tal (AH), Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal (KTPH) and Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (NTFGH) – where Covid-19 pa­tients have been warded.</p>
    <p>All were able to tai­lor meals quickly for th­ese pa­tients be­cause the food is made in-house, rather than be­ing out­sourced, as it is in some hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Anos­mia, the loss of the sense of smell, and ageu­sia, where the pa­tient has a di­min­ished sense of taste, are pe­cu­liar symp­toms of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Dr Ooi Say Tat, an in­fec­tious­dis­eases doc­tor at KTPH, says the ex­act rea­son is not known, but be­cause Covid-19 in­volves sen­sory nerves, pa­tients might lose their sense of smell and/or taste.</p>
    <p>Since nu­tri­tion is key to heal­ing, the chefs had to come up with ways to en­tice pa­tients to eat, so that they can re­cover.</p>
    <p>In non-Covid-19 times, they cater to a va­ri­ety of di­ets any­way, in­clud­ing for pa­tients who, be­cause of cer­tain med­i­ca­tions, lose their sense of taste and smell. They also have to stick to strict nu­tri­tion guide­lines.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 pa­tients, the chal­lenge is to cre­ate food that would be ap­peal­ing to a va­ri­ety of na­tion­al­i­ties – in­clud­ing mi­grant work­ers from In­dia, Bangladesh, Thai­land, Myan­mar and China – with­out adding salt and fat. So they in­ten­sify the flavour of food by us­ing more fresh herbs and spices, and of­fer dishes that are close to the daily di­ets of the pa­tients.</p>
    <p>All three hos­pi­tals knew, early on, that they would have to make quick changes to what they serve Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Mr Choo Kok Seng, ex­ec­u­tive chef of NTFGH in Jurong, which has 700 beds, says: “Around mid-April, we re­ceived feed­back from ward nurses that Covid-19 pa­tients did not like our cur­rent pa­tient meals. Many of our Covid-19 pa­tients are for­eign work­ers from In­dia and Bangladesh.”</p>
    <p>It was the same at KTPH i n Yishun, which has 795 beds and has cared for more than 2,600 Covid-19 pa­tients to date.</p>
    <p>The soup and green veg­eta­bles that are part of the meal trays were re­turned, un­touched, to the kitchen. Mi­grant worker pa­tients did not take to them.</p>
    <p>A KTPH spokesman says: “We have Ben­gali and Tamil in­ter­preters, and mi­grant health­care work­ers from Bangladesh and In­dia, and we en­listed their help to tweak our menu. Covid-19 pa­tients are not al­lowed to move around freely. The least we can do is to give them food that they can eat.”</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal re­placed the greens with more fa­mil­iar veg­eta­bles – drum­stick, a long, bean-like veg­etable and moringa leaves, both from the same plant; and snake gourd. It was al­ready us­ing th­ese veg­eta­bles for pa­tient meals.</p>
    <p>Rasam, a soup with tang from ta­marind, is served at lunch and din­ner to stim­u­late the ap­petite.</p>
    <p>In­stead of adding more salt to bring out the flavour of the food, Mr Nge Aik Tee, the ex­ec­u­tive chef, had his team in­ten­sify the flavour of the stocks they make, by us­ing more veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>Mr Ghaz­ali Mo­hamad, head of the hos­pi­tal’s food ser­vices team, says mi­grant worker pa­tients are used to eat­ing more car­bo­hy­drates, so the hos­pi­tal in­creased the por­tions, serv­ing th­ese pa­tients 11/ times more rice.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>The hos­pi­tal’s chef de par­tie, Mr Shaikh Arsed Ali, who is from In­dia, makes upma, a pop­u­lar In­dian dish, us­ing rice ver­mi­celli; khichdi, a spicy por­ridge dish; pon­gal rice; and ke­sari, a semolina dessert.</p>
    <p>At NTFGH, new menu items usu­ally go through a process of eval­u­a­tion by di­eti­tians and se­nior man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>But in un­prece­dented times, chef Choo was able to fast-track his new of­fer­ings and get them on meal trays.</p>
    <p>The soup and green veg­eta­bles that mi­grant worker pa­tients shunned were re­placed with fruit juices and veg­etable cur­ries fea­tur­ing cau­li­flower, egg­plant and potatoes. Some new of­fer­ings the team came up with in­clude lentil curry, masala chick­peas and chicken curry. In­ten­sity of flavour comes from spices such as cumin, co­rian­der and star anise.</p>
    <p>For non-mi­grant worker pa­tients, his team in­fuses the hor­fun the hos­pi­tal usu­ally serves with more wok hei, by fry­ing the rice noo­dles longer to get that ap­petis­ing charred flavour. Stocks are made with ex­tra bones and with dried mush­rooms, car­rot and corn, to deepen the flavour.</p>
    <p>With the west­ern meals, fresh herbs such as thyme, and in­gre­di­ents such as fresh toma­toes, perk up dishes.</p>
    <p>AH, with 215 beds, used to out­source its meals, but last month, it de­buted an in-house food ser­vices team. It op­er­ates out of a tem­po­rary kitchen while a de­signed-from­scratch one is be­ing built.</p>
    <p>Even so, it has been able to cater to the more than 950 Covid-19 pa­tients who have been warded there.</p>
    <p>Mr Se­bas­tian Low, who heads the food ser­vices team, and ex­ec­u­tive chef Nor­man Leow fo­cus on what they can make in-house to add to and am­plify in­gre­di­ents such as minced chicken pat­ties, fish and veg­e­tar­ian mock meats that the hos­pi­tal buys from sup­pli­ers. In time to come, those pat­ties will be made in-house.</p>
    <p>For now, there is a killer makhani sauce and a green curry sauce that can go on any pro­tein; sayur lodeh; veg­etable curry bright with ta­marind; to­mato rice fra­grant with mus­tard seed and curry leaves; and nasi kun­yit tinged yel­low with turmeric.</p>
    <p>Th­ese dishes are also served to non-Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>For dessert, there is fruit and wob­bly jelly made with lemon­grass-in­fused green tea, sweet­ened with xyl­i­tol, so that di­a­betic pa­tients and those with dif­fi­culty swal­low­ing can also en­joy a pretty rose-shaped dessert.</p>
    <p>One Covid-19 pa­tient there, a Sin­ga­porean in his 20s, was han­ker­ing af­ter fried car­rot cake. The kitchen whipped up a plate for him for break­fast, us­ing radish cake from a sup­plier.</p>
    <p>“He was very happy,” says chef Leow.</p>
