    <p>In au­thor and film-maker Guo Xiaolu’s new novel, A Lover’s Dis­course, the nar­ra­tor, a young Chi­nese woman do­ing her PhD in Lon­don, de­scribes the feel­ing of “wu yu”.</p>
    <p>It is a kind of word­less­ness, she says, a loss of lan­guage that has en­veloped her amid the strange sounds and signs of a Lon­don in the throes of Brexit. When she writes to a love in­ter­est about her “wu yu”, he sug­gests that if she is los­ing one lan­guage, she must be gain­ing an­other.</p>
    <p>“Why can’t I hold on to one lan­guage while gain­ing an­other at the same time?” she thinks. “Why do I have to lose one first?”</p>
    <p>Love, lan­guage and the la­cu­nae be­tween the two are themes that run through­out A Lover’s Dis­course, as they do Guo’s first novel in English, A Con­cise Chi­nese-English Dic­tio­nary For Lovers, writ­ten dic­tio­nary-style in bro­ken English in 2007.</p>
    <p>In a way, A Lover’s Dis­course is a con­tin­u­a­tion of this ear­lier novel – both are about young Chi­nese women ac­cli­ma­tis­ing to Lon­don and new lovers – just as they are off­shoots of Guo’s own story.</p>
    <p>Guo, 47, led a hard­scrab­ble child­hood in China and moved to Lon­don in 2002 to study doc­u­men­tary film di­rect­ing.</p>
    <p>“I was 30 years old and I be­gan to write like a child in a sec­ond lan­guage,” she re­calls over Skype from her home in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>She has lived in France, Ger­many, Switzer­land and New York. “All these places sur­rounded me with for­eign lan­guages, a third lan­guage, a fourth lan­guage, and it cre­ated this dis­course, al­most a dishar­mony, to think and write in. You could be com­pletely lost. I found that very in­spir­ing.”</p>
    <p>Guo, who was named one of Granta’s Best of Young Bri­tish Novelists in 2013, is the au­thor of seven books in Chi­nese and seven books in English.</p>
    <p>She was short­listed for the Orange Prize for Fic­tion for A Con­cise Chi­nese-English Dic­tio­nary and won the Na­tional Book Crit­ics Cir­cle Award for her 2017 mem­oir Once Upon A Time In The East.</p>
    <p>Last year, she was one of the judges for the Booker Prize, which con­tro­ver­sially named two win­ners, Mar­garet At­wood and Bernar­dine Evaristo. “It was an amaz­ing ex­pe­ri­ence,” she says, skirt­ing a ques­tion on which side of the tie she had been on.</p>
    <p>In A Lover’s Dis­course, the nar­ra­tor and her part­ner, an Aus­tralian-Ger­man land­scape ar­chi­tect, live on a canal house­boat to es­cape the stric­tures of ur­ban liv­ing, al­though she dis­cov­ers it is not as glam­orously bo­hemian as it seems. Later, they have a baby and she nav­i­gates moth­er­hood while strug­gling with her own sense of be­long­ing.</p>
    <p>The par­ents of Guo’s part­ner, Aus­tralia-born phi­los­o­phy lec­turer Stephen Barker, lived for many years on a boat near Queens­land in the Pa­cific Ocean. She and Pro­fes­sor Barker have a daugh­ter, Moon, seven.</p>
    <p>But it is not enough to write based on per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence, she cau­tions. “It’s also ex­tremely im­por­tant to have the in­tel­lec­tual ca­pac­ity to write some­thing you have not lived.”</p>
    <p>A Lover’s Dis­course is Guo’s spin on French philoso­pher Roland Barthes’ A Lover’s Dis­course: Frag­ments (1977). She says she loves Barthes’ work, his “off-cen­tre way of think­ing”.</p>
    <p>Barthes is best-known for his “death of the au­thor” t heory, which chal­lenges the tra­di­tion of priv­i­leg­ing the au­thor’s bi­og­ra­phy and in­tent as the con­trol­ling mean­ing of a text.</p>
    <p>Through­out her novel, Guo probes the no­tions of au­thor­ship and au­then­tic­ity. As part of her PhD re­search, the nar­ra­tor goes to the vil­lage of Dafen in Guang­dong, China, where ar­ti­sans – mostly self­taught – churn out re­pro­duc­tions of mas­ter­pieces by Claude Monet, Vin­cent van Gogh, Leonardo da Vinci and more.</p>
    <p>Guo, who has made 11 films, went to Dafen to make her 2018 doc­u­men­tary Five Men And A Car­avag­gio, which fol­lows a re­pro­duc­tion of Car­avag­gio’s John In The Wilder­ness from its cre­ation in Dafen to its cri­tiquing in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>“We’re com­ing into this age where ev­ery­thing’s re­pro­duced, copied or in­ter­preted in such dif­fer­ent ways, where stuff is be­ing masspro­duced and democra­tised,” says Guo, nod­ding to cul­tural critic Wal­ter Ben­jamin’s 1935 es­say The Work Of Art In The Age Of Me­chan­i­cal Re­pro­duc­tion. “It’s a great era to think about what is art.”</p>
    <p>In the novel, she says, the death of the au­thor cor­re­sponds to the re­birth of the in­di­vid­ual. “We as in­di­vid­u­als should be the authors of our own lives, which means we should refuse a mass-pro­duced con­cept of com­mer­cial life. We should in­vent our own lives.”</p>
    <p>Guo’s fa­ther was an artist, which in­deli­bly im­printed the value of art in her young mind. A state painter and a poet, he spent 15 years in a prison camp in the 1950s and dur­ing the Cul­tural Rev­o­lu­tion. Her mother was a Red Guard and later a fac­tory worker.</p>
    <p>Born and raised in Zhe­jiang prov­ince, Guo was given away twice as a child, first to a poor peas­ant cou­ple in the moun­tains, then two years later to her grand­par­ents in the fish­ing vil­lage of Shi­tang. In that house­hold, where there was lit­tle to eat, she watched her grand­fa­ther abuse her grand­mother, who had been a child bride.</p>
    <p>It was only when she was seven that she met her par­ents and went to live with them and her older brother in the city of Wen­ling.</p>
    <p>“I think we chil­dren suf­fered as much as our grand­par­ents who went through the war and our par­ents who went through the Cul­tural Rev­o­lu­tion,” she says. Both her par­ents have since died of can­cer.</p>
    <p>“First, there’s the ma­te­rial de­pri­va­tion and then there’s the emo­tional de­pri­va­tion. We grew up in this love­less, ma­te­ri­al­ist, re­ally bleak so­cial en­vi­ron­ment. Some­how we sur­vived. Peo­ple say that Chi­nese peo­ple are tough and re­silient, but I think we are still in this state of post-trauma.”</p>
    <p>Guo had to for­feit her Chi­nese pass­port when she took Bri­tish na­tion­al­ity. She says she has found Brexit a “huge dis­ap­point­ment”.</p>
    <p>“It gives the for­eign­ers here in Lon­don a lot of un­cer­tainty and a new ques­tion: Are we stay­ing, or are we mov­ing back? It wasn’t a ques­tion be­fore that Lon­don’s one of the great­est cities in the world. But now I ques­tion it: Is Lon­don still wor­thy to grasp on to?”</p>
    <p>In A Lover’s Dis­course, the nar­ra­tor moves out of Lon­don to a farm in Ger­many, but finds she misses the city. “Lon­don was the place I had be­gun my adult life, the place I had fi­nally re­alised that I had for­ever lost my par­ents and my home coun­try,” she says. She tells her part­ner: “It might take me years to know where we will end up.”</p>
    <p>He re­sponds: “Or, per­haps never.”</p>
