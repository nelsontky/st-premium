    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans will re­ceive more sup­port at each stage of life, as part of a shift in the Govern­ment’s so­cial pol­icy af­ter the Covid-19 cri­sis ends, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment will do more to help young fam­i­lies own their homes, and to im­prove their own and their chil­dren’s lives through qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing path­ways, she said.</p>
    <p>Mid­dle-aged Sin­ga­pore­ans will re­ceive more help to se­cure good jobs and give them greater as­sur­ance of re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy, she added. Se­niors will be well taken care of so that they can age well and with dig­nity.</p>
    <p>In her tra­di­tional ad­dress at the open­ing of Par­lia­ment, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah said Sin­ga­pore be­gan strength­en­ing its so­cial safety nets more than a decade ago, and has rolled out many emer­gency mea­sures amid the Covid-19 cri­sis to help Sin­ga­pore­ans cope.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant and the Tem­po­rary Re­lief Fund, which pro­vided fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to those whose jobs or in­come were af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are tem­po­rary re­lief mea­sures, but we do ex­pect a per­ma­nent shift to a new nor­mal af­ter the cri­sis,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent noted that in­di­vid­u­als will need greater so­cial sup­port than be­fore as Sin­ga­pore en­ters an era of volatil­ity, un­cer­tainty and dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>“We will have to con­sider care­fully how to strengthen our so­cial safety nets, to give Sin­ga­pore­ans more as­sur­ance cop­ing with life’s un­cer­tain­ties,” she said, adding this will have to be done in a way that is fi­nan­cially sus­tain­able for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>But more re­dis­tri­bu­tion can­not be the only way to help those who are lag­ging be­hind, said Madam Hal­imah.</p>
    <p>Be­yond this, Sin­ga­pore will also have to con­tinue strength­en­ing so­cial mo­bil­ity and broad­en­ing its con­cep­tion of merit, she added.</p>
    <p>Mer­i­toc­racy, a cru­cial pil­lar of so­ci­ety, has served Sin­ga­pore well over the past 55 years, she said.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, just as our so­cial norms and poli­cies have evolved in tan­dem with Sin­ga­pore’s devel­op­ment, so too must our model of mer­i­toc­racy.”</p>
    <p>She said the Govern­ment recog­nises that un­fet­tered mer­i­toc­racy can fos­ter ex­ces­sive com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“We also re­alise the need to level up fam­i­lies who are at a dis­ad­van­tage, and give their chil­dren a fair start in life,” she added.</p>
    <p>“We want to keep our so­ci­ety open and so­cially mo­bile, and not al­low it to strat­ify and os­sify over time.”</p>
    <p>That is why Sin­ga­pore has made a con­certed ef­fort to value a wide range of tal­ents, and con­tin­ues to in­vest heav­ily in ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing, she said.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, schools and in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing ad­mit stu­dents through other bench­marks be­sides aca­demic re­sults, while the Pub­lic Ser­vice Com­mis­sion has widened its catch­ment of schol­ar­ship hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal par­ties are also field­ing can­di­dates who took dif­fer­ent paths in life, and have di­verse tal­ents and strengths, she said.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple path­ways are also be­ing de­vel­oped for young Sin­ga­pore­ans to achieve their fullest po­ten­tial re­gard­less of their start­ing point, while the Skill­sFu­ture scheme will en­able every worker to gain more skills and progress through­out his ca­reer, be­yond his ini­tial qual­i­fi­ca­tions, she added.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ers must sup­port life­long learn­ing as the new norm. So­ci­ety must value peo­ple for what they con­trib­ute, in every job and every role,” said the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>She added that build­ing a fair and just so­ci­ety goes be­yond govern­ment ac­tions. “It re­quires the sup­port and par­tic­i­pa­tion of all Sin­ga­pore­ans,” she said.</p>
    <p>It also turns on how Sin­ga­pore­ans look af­ter the most vul­ner­a­ble mem­bers of so­ci­ety, from help­ing stu­dents from dis­ad­van­taged fam­i­lies through schemes that bring dif­fer­ent groups to­gether, to pro­vid­ing train­ing and job op­por­tu­ni­ties for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties as well as bridg­ing the dig­i­tal di­vide for se­niors.</p>
    <p>“We have made progress over the last decade, and we will do much more in this term of govern­ment to see our peo­ple through the cri­sis and be­yond,” she said.</p>
    <p>“The more closely knit we are as a peo­ple, the fur­ther we can move ahead as a na­tion.”</p>
