    <p>WASH­ING­TON • World Bank chief econ­o­mist Car­men Rein­hart said the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is turn­ing into a ma­jor eco­nomic cri­sis and warned of the pos­si­bil­ity of a fi­nan­cial cri­sis emerg­ing.</p>
    <p>“This did not start as a fi­nan­cial cri­sis but it is mor­ph­ing into a ma­jor eco­nomic cri­sis, with very se­ri­ous fi­nan­cial con­se­quences,” Ms Rein­hart said i n an i nter­view with Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion. “There’s a long road ahead.”</p>
    <p>Ms Rein­hart, who took on her role in June, is best known for her work on the last fi­nan­cial cri­sis with then Har­vard col­league Ken­neth Ro­goff in their 2009 book, This Time Is Dif­fer­ent: Eight Cen­turies Of Fi­nan­cial Folly. It made the pair the go-to re­source on the his­tory of gov­ern­ment de­faults, re­ces­sions, bank runs, cur­rency sell­offs, and in­fla­tion­ary spikes.</p>
    <p>Asked whether cen­tral banks buy­ing bonds to keep yields low is ul­ti­mately a zero-sum game when ev­ery­one is do­ing it, Ms Rein­hart said:</p>
    <p>“This is a war. Dur­ing wars, gov­ern­ments fi­nance their war ex­pen­di­tures how­ever they can and right now there are dire needs.</p>
    <p>“The sce­nario we are in is not a sus­tain­able one.”</p>
    <p>Ms Rein­hart spoke af­ter the world’s rich­est na­tions agreed to re­new a debt-re­lief ini­tia­tive for the poor­est through at least the first half of next year, fall­ing short of the World Bank’s call for a full-year ex­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>China is owed al­most 60 per cent of the money that the world’s poor­est na­tions would be due to re­pay this year, ac­cord­ing to World Bank data. It has made many loans to de­vel­op­ing coun­tries with terms that are not trans­par­ent and at higher in­ter­est rates than they can af­ford, the bank’s pres­i­dent said in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Asked about China not par­tic­i­pat­ing in the debt-sus­pen­sion re­lief, Ms Rein­hart said the na­tion was in fact in­volved, just “less than fully”.</p>
    <p>The China De­vel­op­ment Bank, a ma­jor lender, has not joined the ef­fort, nor have pri­vate sec­tor cred­i­tors, she said. “Full par­tic­i­pa­tion is some­thing we should strive for but un­for­tu­nately haven’t yet seen.”</p>
    <p>This is a war. Dur­ing wars, gov­ern­ments fi­nance their war ex­pen­di­tures how­ever they can and right now there are dire needs. The sce­nario we are in is not a sus­tain­able one.</p>
