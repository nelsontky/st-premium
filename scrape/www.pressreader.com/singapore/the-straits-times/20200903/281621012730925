    <p>The de­ci­sion to im­pose the nearly two-month-long circuit breaker to choke the spread of Covid-19 was made by Cab­i­net min­is­ters and not by mem­bers of the civil ser­vice, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>PM Lee re­vealed this in mak­ing a point about how his Cab­i­net min­is­ters have to study the work of their min­istries well and, if necessary, over­ride their staff.</p>
    <p>Such a course of ac­tion could be be­cause there are po­lit­i­cal fac­tors that the min­is­ters are privy to, but it is also be­cause the min­is­ters have to ex­er­cise judg­ment and take re­spon­si­bil­ity for their de­ci­sions. “The staff did not rec­om­mend the circuit breaker. We dis­cussed it in Cab­i­net, there were many pros and cons,” said PM Lee, adding that he told his col­leagues to think about the move care­fully and take time to de­cide.</p>
    <p>“I said: Bet­ter think about this care­fully... Go back, sleep on it, work out the pro­posal, work out an­other pro­posal, 30 per cent more dra­co­nian. Come back to­mor­row morn­ing. Talk about it. Dis­cuss, de­cide.”</p>
    <p>“The Cab­i­net de­cides. It is a big de­ci­sion, $5 bil­lion of a sup­ple­men­tary Bud­get. Civil ser­vants – un­elected – can make this, can carry this?... Any­body can make it hap­pen? I think that is not in this world.”</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh on the is­sue of whether a change in gov­ern­ment will im­pact the qual­ity of the civil ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh had put to PM Lee a quote from found­ing prime minister Lee Kuan Yew as­sert­ing that due to its good pub­lic ser­vice, Sin­ga­pore will be able to run well even if there is a change in gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said the civil ser­vice has been de­signed to be as ca­pa­ble as pos­si­ble to not col­lapse straight­away if the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party is out of gov­ern­ment, but good lead­ers are needed for it to con­tinue run­ning as a sys­tem that is finely tuned and ca­pa­ble.</p>
    <p>He added that the min­is­ters in his Cab­i­net are part of the ex­ec­u­tive staff who run the min­istry and are ex­pected to know the ins and outs of pol­icy. “He must mas­ter and ex­plain it. And when he runs the min­istry, he must de­cide what the con­tents are, what the di­rec­tion is, the de­tails and, if necessary, over­ride the of­fi­cials and de­cide on the di­rec­tion.”</p>
