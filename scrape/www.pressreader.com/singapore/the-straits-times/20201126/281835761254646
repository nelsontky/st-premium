    <p>• China will likely re­turn to a more “proper” range of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment next year, Pre­mier Li Ke­qiang said, in­di­cat­ing a strong re­bound in growth af­ter this year’s pan­demic slump.</p>
    <p>Af­ter tak­ing a se­vere knock in the first quar­ter, the econ­omy is re­cov­er­ing and set to post pos­i­tive growth this year, Mr Li said at a joint me­dia brief­ing on Tues­day along­side the lead­ers of six in­ter­na­tional eco­nomic in­sti­tu­tions, in­clud­ing the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund and World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect China’s econ­omy will re­turn to the proper range of de­vel­op­ment next year,” he said. “China’s macro poli­cies will re­main sta­ble, ef­fec­tive and sus­tain­able.”</p>
    <p>Mr Li re­it­er­ated China’s eco­nomic strat­egy of al­low­ing con­sump­tion to play a lead­ing role in driv­ing growth, and grad­u­ally open­ing up to for­eign in­vestors. He said China does not de­lib­er­ately tar­get a trade sur­plus, an is­sue that has been a source of ten­sion with the United States.</p>
    <p>“We will ab­so­lutely not pur­sue a trade sur­plus,” Mr Li said. “We will main­tain equal im­por­tance for im­ports and ex­ports. We want to achieve trade bal­ance and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment.”</p>
    <p>China re­cently laid out its five- and 15-year plans for the econ­omy, out­lin­ing an am­bi­tion to dou­ble gross do­mes­tic prod­uct by 2035, with a fo­cus on self-re­liance in tech­nol­ogy and boost­ing do­mes­tic con­sump­tion. The econ­omy, the sec­ond-largest in the world, is the only ma­jor one tipped to ex­pand this year – by about 2 per cent, ac­cord­ing to econ­o­mists sur­veyed by Bloomberg – af­ter the au­thor­i­ties brought the pan­demic un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment sec­re­tary-gen­eral An­gel Gur­ria said at the same brief­ing that China’s econ­omy could ex­pand by about 8 per cent next year, be­fore eas­ing to about 5 per cent. Mr Li did not give a fore­cast for growth.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund manag­ing di­rec­tor Kristalina Ge­orgieva said at the brief­ing that some coun­tries may be los­ing mo­men­tum as they deal with new waves of virus in­fec­tions. She added that vac­cines and treat­ments should be made avail­able to ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a sep­a­rate gov­ern­ment state­ment, Mr Li said at the meet­ing that China will use re­forms to pro­mote the econ­omy’s re­cov­ery and will con­tinue its ac­tive fis­cal and sta­ble mon­e­tary poli­cies.</p>
    <p>He also said China wel­comes more coun­tries join­ing the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship trade pact, which was signed ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>We will ab­so­lutely not pur­sue a trade sur­plus. We will main­tain equal im­por­tance for im­ports and ex­ports. We want to achieve trade bal­ance and sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment.</p>
