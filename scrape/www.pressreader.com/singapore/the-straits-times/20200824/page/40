    <h3>LIFE | MIND &amp; BODY</h3>
    <p>
        life mind & body C4 THE STRAITS TIMES MONDAY, AUGUST 24, 2020 | | | Sparkling in your golden years Sometimes, we go against the tide to show ourselves that we are indeed capable of countering the proverbial biological clock — often at our very own expense. What once used to be weekly tennis sessions with the buddies now limps into bi-weekly brisk walks. Remember how at the peak of your powers, you could last the full 90 in a football game, and still have it in your reserves to complete the warm-down after? Now, a cameo from the bench would suffice.
But ageing does not have to be all that bad. While it certainly takes some getting used to, and an acceptance that we cannot go on forever working our bodies like we used to, there are ways to soften the blow to ensure a seamless passage into the golden years. By JUSTIN CHUA Here are a few. Learn something new In order to stay sharp, keeping your mind engaged is essential, and one way to do just that is to never stop learning. Life is essentiall­y a never-ending opportunit­y to take on new skills, and experience­s. From taking up a cooking course, to learning a new language, your newfound pockets of time are there to be seized upon! Embrace simplicity Appreciate the simple things in life. If ever there was a time to stop and smell the flowers, this would be it. Shedding the former you does not necessaril­y mean a loss. Try focusing on the gained opportunit­y to enjoy what your work life rarely allowed for, like spending more time with your family and completing the Netflix catalogue. Listen to your body While it is only natural that you might not be able to go power through your former exercise routine, you should still try to maintain some form of an active lifestyle. Avoid exerting yourself, so take it all in your stride. Photos: Get t yImages specialist aesthetic wellness Dr GOH Adj. EYE Assoc. SPECIALIST
