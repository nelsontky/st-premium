    <p>• Banks are putting the brakes on Bri­tish com­mer­cial real es­tate lend­ing as the pan­demic bat­ters the econ­omy and stokes fears about loom­ing de­faults.</p>
    <p>New loans de­clined in the first half by 34 per cent from a year ear­lier to £15.5 bil­lion (S$27.3 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to a re­port from The Busi­ness School in the City of London. More than a fifth of lenders sur­veyed said they made no new com­mer­cial prop­erty loans in the pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus has plunged Bri­tain into a painful re­ces­sion. Gov­ern­ment l ock­down mea­sures to slow the out­break have forced many busi­nesses – espe­cially restau­rants, bars and re­tail­ers – to close, crip­pling their abil­ity to pay rent and threat­en­ing prop­erty prices. That is rais­ing the prospect of more loan de­faults as the value of com­mer­cial prop­er­ties de­creases, leav­ing bor­row­ers in vi­o­la­tion of the terms of their loans.</p>
    <p>“The short-term ef­fects of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic have only just be­come vis­i­ble, but the longterm ef­fects will im­pact lend­ing and bank­ing into next year and be­yond,” said The Busi­ness School se­nior re­search fel­low and au­thor of the re­port Ni­cole Lux.</p>
    <p>So far, many lenders have ex­tended loans or pro­vided short­term re­fi­nanc­ing to strug­gling bor­row­ers, ac­cord­ing to the re­port. That could change in the fourth quar­ter, when en­force­ment ac­tions could be­gin for some prop­erty types such as re­tail, shop­ping cen­tres and ho­tels.</p>
    <p>The amount lenders were pre­pared to of­fer against the best re­tail out­lets av­er­aged just over half of the value of the prop­er­ties, the low­est level ever recorded by the re­search. Only 27 of the 76 lenders sur­veyed would of­fer a price for such loans.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey sam­ple in­cluded banks, build­ing so­ci­eties, in­sur­ers and other lenders.</p>
