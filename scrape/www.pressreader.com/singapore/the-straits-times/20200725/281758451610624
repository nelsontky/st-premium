    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are un­likely to be able to go on week­end hol­i­days in Malaysia any time soon as travel re­quire­ments be­tween both coun­tries will re­main strin­gent, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a vir­tual me­dia con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, he added that the new cross-bor­der travel ar­range­ments put in place are meant for work­ers in es­sen­tial ser­vices who need to travel to and fro be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“For those who are think­ing about hol­i­days, un­for­tu­nately I think we have to put off the idea for quite some time yet,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia agreed to restart travel through two schemes: the re­cip­ro­cal green lane and the pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>The for­mer is meant for those on es­sen­tial or of­fi­cial busi­ness, while the lat­ter al­lows Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents and Malaysia res­i­dents who hold long-term im­mi­gra­tion passes for busi­ness and work pur­poses in the other coun­try to en­ter that coun­try for work.</p>
    <p>Af­ter at least three con­sec­u­tive months in their coun­try of work, they may re­turn to their home coun­try for short-term home leave.</p>
    <p>More de­tails will be an­nounced be­fore these new travel schemes take ef­fect on Aug 10. El­i­gi­ble trav­ellers for the green lane will have to get swabbed for Covid-19 and sub­mit their itin­er­ar­ies to the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said dis­cus­sions on travel ar­range­ments with Malaysia are on track.</p>
    <p>But ar­range­ments for com­muters who travel back and forth be­tween both coun­tries on a daily ba­sis are still be­ing dis­cussed, he added.</p>
    <p>“We do not want to see that large vol­ume of daily com­muters, as was the case be­fore Covid-19... Nei­ther Malaysia nor Sin­ga­pore will be able to ac­com­mo­date that large vol­ume of travel on a daily ba­sis in a safe and sus­tain­able man­ner in a Covid-19 en­vi­ron­ment,” he said.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Travel re&#xAD;quire&#xAD;ments be&#xAD;tween Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore and Malaysia will stay strin&#xAD;gent, so short trips to pop&#xAD;u&#xAD;lar Malaysian des&#xAD;ti&#xAD;na&#xAD;tions like Me&#xAD;laka (above) are un&#xAD;likely in the near fu&#xAD;ture.</p>
