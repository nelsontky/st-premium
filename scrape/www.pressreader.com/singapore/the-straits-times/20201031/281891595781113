    <p>Two years ago, of­fi­cials from a govern­ment depart­ment in Aus­tralia made a deal to buy a 12ha patch of farm­land to be used as a run­way for a new in­ter­na­tional air­port in Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>But it emerged in a re­cent govern­ment au­dit re­port that the of­fi­cials had ended up agree­ing to pay al­most A$30 mil­lion (S$28.8 mil­lion) for the land, even though the prop­erty had been val­ued at just A$3 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>This un­usual deal caused pub­lic out­rage and is now be­ing in­ves­ti­gated by the Aus­tralian Fed­eral Po­lice.</p>
    <p>It is just one of a se­ries of scandals in re­cent weeks that have led to grow­ing calls for the fed­eral govern­ment to set up a lon­gawaited na­tional anti-cor­rup­tion com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>An­other case in­volved the chief ex­ec­u­tive of the pub­licly owned Aus­tralia Post, Ms Chris­tine Hol­gate.</p>
    <p>She was urged by the govern­ment to stand aside af­ter it emerged that she gave Cartier watches to four top ex­ec­u­tives to thank them for clinch­ing a busi­ness deal.</p>
    <p>The watches were worth about A$20,000 in to­tal.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said last week he was shocked and ap­palled by the rev­e­la­tions and de­scribed the gifts as “dis­grace­ful”.</p>
    <p>He added: “We are the share­hold­ers of Aus­tralia Post on be­half of the Aus­tralian peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“The chief ex­ec­u­tive... has been in­structed to stand aside; if she doesn’t wish to do that, she can go.”</p>
    <p>De­spite Mr Mor­ri­son’s com­ments, Ms Hol­gate’s lawyers said on Thurs­day that she has not been for­mally stood aside.</p>
    <p>A sep­a­rate in­ci­dent in­volved Mr James Ship­ton, chair­man of cor­po­rate watch­dog the Aus­tralian Se­cu­ri­ties and In­vest­ments Com­mis­sion (Asic).</p>
    <p>Af­ter it emerged that the com­mis­sion had paid A$118,557 to pre­pare his tax re­turns, Mr Ship­ton said he would stand aside pend­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>He also agreed to re­pay the ex­penses, which were spent on per­sonal tax ad­vice as part of his move back from the United States to head Asic in 2018.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­ci­dents have added to long-run­ning calls for the rul­ing coali­tion to cre­ate a stand­ing fed­eral anti-cor­rup­tion body that could in­ves­ti­gate al­leged mis­con­duct by politi­cians and govern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia, states tend to have strong anti-cor­rup­tion bod­ies which have led to the down­fall of sev­eral lead­ers.</p>
    <p>But there is no sim­i­lar fed­eral body.</p>
    <p>Over­all trust in the govern­ment in Aus­tralia has been de­clin­ing in re­cent years – a slide blamed on a se­ries of in­ter­nal po­lit­i­cal coups.</p>
    <p>This lack of trust has prompted calls to im­prove trans­parency and also ad­dress cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>An in­de­pen­dent MP, Ms He­len Haines, this week in­tro­duced her own Bill to cre­ate an anti-cor­rup­tion agency.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed agency would be able to hold open hear­ings and in­ves­ti­gate mat­ters re­ferred to it by the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“Like most Aus­tralians, I’ve lost pa­tience af­ter watch­ing rolling scandals and noth­ing com­ing of it – ex­cept di­min­ish­ing trust in politi­cians when we most need it,” Ms Haines said on Twit­ter on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>But the rul­ing Lib­eral-Na­tional Coali­tion is un­likely to sup­port it and has in­stead pro­posed its own plan to cre­ate an anti-cor­rup­tion body.</p>
    <p>The coali­tion be­gan work­ing on plans for such a body in 2018 and had a draft ready in De­cem­ber last year but has yet to in­tro­duce it to Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Asked about the de­lay, Mr Mor­ri­son said he was con­cerned about di­vert­ing at­ten­tion from the re­sponse to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion La­bor party crit­i­cised the de­lay, sug­gest­ing the coali­tion is mov­ing slowly to avoid scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>“It is a de­lib­er­ate de­ci­sion from Mor­ri­son to try to go slow when it comes to deal­ing with cor­rup­tion,” La­bor MP Tony Burke told Sky News.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts have crit­i­cised the coali­tion’s pro­posed com­mis­sion, say­ing it will be too weak and un­able to pub­licly hear cor­rup­tion in­quiries into politi­cians and their staff.</p>
    <p>The Univer­sity of New South Wales’ Mark Rolfe, an ex­pert on Aus­tralian pol­i­tics, de­scribed the coali­tion’s pro­posed com­mis­sion as a “joke”.</p>
    <p>“It’s not go­ing to be look­ing at politi­cians or at the re­la­tions of min­is­ters and de­part­ments, which is what the cur­rent (New South Wales state cor­rup­tion com­mis­sion) does,” he said on Thurs­day in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“But I don’t think Mor­ri­son wants a fed­eral (com­mis­sion) look­ing un­der all the rocks and stones and dis­cov­er­ing things un­der there that might dam­age his govern­ment.”</p>
    <p>An ex­pert on po­lit­i­cal ac­count­abil­ity, Dr Yee-Fui Ng of Monash Univer­sity, said the coali­tion’s pro­posal would al­low in­quiries to be launched only if the com­mis­sion al­ready sus­pects that crim­i­nal cor­rup­tion had oc­curred.</p>
    <p>This, she said, was a “dif­fi­cult hur­dle to clear” and would limit the com­mis­sion’s abil­ity to un­veil cor­rup­tion through its own in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“It shouldn’t be left to the govern­ment to mon­i­tor it­self any longer,” she wrote on The Con­ver­sa­tion web­site.</p>
