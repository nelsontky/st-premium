    <p>Bri­tish op­er­a­tor Tower Tran­sit yes­ter­day clinched a $1.03 bil­lion con­tract for two bus pack­ages, which in­clude routes in Sem­bawang and Yishun cur­rently run by SMRT.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA) awarded Tower Tran­sit Sin­ga­pore (TTS) a five-year con­tract for the Bulim and Sem­bawangYish­un pack­ages, which cover 56 bus routes.</p>
    <p>The con­tract will be­gin from the sec­ond quar­ter of next year, and is a gain for Tower Tran­sit as it ex­pands its foot­print in the trans­port land­scape here.</p>
    <p>Tower Tran­sit will also con­tinue to man­age Bukit Ba­tok and Jurong East bus in­ter­changes, which are part of the Bulim pack­age it now runs, as well as Sem­bawang and Yishun bus in­ter­changes, which are cur­rently man­aged by SMRT.</p>
    <p>The LTA said Tower Tran­sit’s bid had re­ceived the high­est to­tal score af­ter fac­tor­ing in price and qual­ity fac­tors.</p>
    <p>The roughly 320 buses in the Bulim pack­age ferry com­muters in Cle­menti, Jurong East and Bukit Ba­tok along 29 routes. The Sem­bawang-Yishun pack­age com­prises about 400 buses ply­ing 27 routes.</p>
    <p>The change in op­er­a­tor means SMRT driv­ers in­volved in th­ese routes will be of­fered a job by Tower Tran­sit.</p>
    <p>Guide­lines stip­u­late that Tower Tran­sit’s em­ploy­ment terms can­not leave the driv­ers worse off than their cur­rent agree­ment with SMRT.</p>
    <p>The ten­der, called last Novem­ber, was the first time the LTA con­cur­rently called ten­ders for two pack­ages, which it said could achieve “economies of scale”.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tors sub­mit­ted a bid for the com­bined pack­age, and also bid for each bus pack­age sep­a­rately.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences (SUSS) trans­port econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira said the fi­nal bids bore this aim out.</p>
    <p>“It looks from the bids that TTS was able to promise this to a greater ex­tent than some of the com­peti­tors... But all par­ties did in­cor­po­rate a dis­count for the joint bid com­pared with the sin­gle bids,” he said.</p>
    <p>Tower Tran­sit bid $482 mil­lion for the Bulim pack­age, $582 mil­lion for the Sem­bawang-Yishun pack­age, and $1.03 bil­lion for the com­bined one.</p>
    <p>SMRT bid $540 mil­lion for the Bulim bus pack­age, $700 mil­lion for the Sem­bawang-Yishun bus pack­age, and $1.19 bil­lion for the com­bined one.</p>
    <p>On TTS’ al­most dou­bling of its bus routes, SUSS trans­port re­searcher Park Byung Joon said it would have been a very dif­fer­ent story if SMRT and SBS Tran­sit had won, sug­gest­ing that it “would have been the end of bus ten­der in Sin­ga­pore” and the re­turn to the era of hav­ing only two bus op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>“TTS is not and will never be in the po­si­tion to com­pete with the two lo­cal gi­ants,” he said. “TTS is go­ing to be as big as what LTA is go­ing to al­low them to be.”</p>
