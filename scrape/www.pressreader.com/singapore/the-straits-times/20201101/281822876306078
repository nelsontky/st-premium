    <p>At ral­lies, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has re­peat­edly claimed that the elec­tion is be­ing rigged against him and sug­gested that the only way he loses is if Democrats cheat.</p>
    <p>But while there have been iso­lated cases of fraud, there is lit­tle ev­i­dence of ex­ten­sive or sig­nif­i­cant fraud in elec­tions in the United States, and noth­ing back­ing his al­le­ga­tions that mail vot­ing is sus­cep­ti­ble to wide­spread fraud.</p>
    <p>The rhetoric, how­ever, has been ef­fec­tive. Mul­ti­ple polls have shown that both sides of the po­lit­i­cal di­vide be­lieve the other will cheat to win, lay­ing the ground­work for an elec­tion re­sult that one side or the other will al­most in­evitably feel ag­grieved at.</p>
    <p>“Whether (Demo­crat con­tender Joe) Bi­den or Trump emerges as the win­ner, mil­lions of Amer­i­cans will likely be­lieve that their can­di­date was robbed,” Johns Hop­kins Uni­ver­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Yascha Mounk wrote in a com­men­tary in The At­lantic in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>He cited a July poll of 1,000 Amer­i­cans com­mis­sioned by non-profit groups Cam­paign Le­gal Cen­tre and Pro­tect Democ­racy. It found that 43 per cent of Trump vot­ers think that if Mr Bi­den wins, it will be be­cause vot­ing sys­tems are rigged and voter fraud is com­mit­ted, com­pared with 33 per cent who think his vic­tory will be be­cause he got more votes.</p>
    <p>For Bi­den vot­ers, 63 per cent said a Trump vic­tory will be be­cause of voter sup­pres­sion and for­eign in­ter­fer­ence, dwarf­ing the 20 per cent who think it will be be­cause he got more votes.</p>
    <p>“Most Amer­i­cans be­lieve the up­com­ing elec­tion will be le­git­i­mate – un­less their favourite can­di­date loses,” said Dr Mounk, a se­nior ad­viser at Pro­tect Democ­racy.</p>
    <p>“Amer­i­can democ­racy could face one of the big­gest tests of its le­git­i­macy in liv­ing mem­ory.”</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, a Mon­mouth Uni­ver­sity poll sim­i­larly found that a “small but size­able num­ber of vot­ers”, 37 per cent of the 758 sur­veyed, could be sus­pi­cious of the elec­tion re­sult what­ever it may be.</p>
    <p>Just un­der half be­lieved in the ex­is­tence of “se­cret vot­ers” who sup­port Mr Trump and will ma­te­ri­alise on elec­tion day, while just over half reckon there is for­eign in­ter­fer­ence in the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Most Amer­i­cans who have made up their minds ex­pect the can­di­date of the other party to cheat.</p>
    <p>Nearly all (91 per cent) firm Bi­den sup­port­ers ex­pect Mr Trump to cheat, but only 8 per cent said the same of their own can­di­date. Firm Trump sup­port­ers mir­rored this dy­namic, with 78 per cent say­ing it is likely the Bi­den cam­paign will cheat and 8 per cent say­ing the same for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent has al­ready started sow­ing doubt about elec­tion in­tegrity. This not only in­creases scep­ti­cism among his own sup­port­ers but also raises sus­pi­cion among his op­po­nents,” said Mon­mouth Uni­ver­sity Polling In­sti­tute di­rec­tor Pa­trick Mur­ray.</p>
    <p>Voter fraud, which can in­clude fraud­u­lently vot­ing on some­one else’s be­half, vot­ing when in­el­i­gi­ble, vot­ing more than once and chang­ing the vote count, is rel­a­tively rare in Amer­i­can pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion di­rec­tor Christo­pher Wray told the Se­nate at a hear­ing in Septem­ber that the Bureau has not seen ev­i­dence of wide­spread voter fraud, un­der­cut­ting Mr Trump’s claims.</p>
    <p>The Her­itage Foun­da­tion, a con­ser­va­tive think-tank, found 1,300 cases of voter fraud and has col­lated them in a data­base.</p>
    <p>The data­base has been crit­i­cised as ex­ag­ger­ated by the left-lean­ing think-tank, Bren­nan Cen­tre for Jus­tice, which noted that over 3 bil­lion votes had been cast in the time pe­riod the cases are drawn from.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic has caused a surge in mail vot­ing, which some states are not as ex­pe­ri­enced in, re­sult­ing in some cases of hu­man er­ror and tech­no­log­i­cal mal­func­tions that Mr Trump has seized on as ev­i­dence to back his claims.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, nearly 50,000 vot­ers in Ohio re­ceived in­cor­rect ab­sen­tee bal­lots last month, af­ter a ma­chine was set wrongly. Cor­rected bal­lots were mailed within 72 hours, said elec­tion of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Yet, the per­cep­tion of vot­ing fraud per­sists, fu­elling vot­ers’ dis­trust in the elec­tion process and rais­ing fears of vi­o­lence in the af­ter­math from those who do not ac­cept the re­sult.</p>
    <p>The propen­sity for Democrats to cast mail bal­lots, which are counted later and may have the ca­pac­ity to turn the tide against an early red wave from Repub­li­cans who vote in per­son on Tues­day, may also fuel un­hap­pi­ness if the re­sult tilts against Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin voter and home health­care nurs­ing as­sis­tant Laura Bur­bie, 55, told The Sun­day Times: “I’m re­ally afraid be­cause it is so ugly and so heated out there right now that I don’t think it mat­ters who’s go­ing to win.</p>
    <p>“I fear for the day af­ter the elec­tion. I just have this fear that as ugly as it is right now, it’s go­ing to be worse and I can’t imag­ine worse.”</p>
