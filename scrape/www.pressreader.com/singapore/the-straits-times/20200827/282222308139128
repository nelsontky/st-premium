    <p>Fi­nance pro­fes­sion­als ex­pect a slow re­turn to nor­mal from the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus-in­duced re­ces­sion, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey by the As­so­ci­a­tion of Char­tered Cer­ti­fied Ac­coun­tants (ACCA) Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This comes as 66 per cent of the re­spon­dents, from an ex­pert panel of 115 fi­nance pro­fes­sion­als, said their firms’ cus­tomers have com­pletely stopped or re­duced their pur­chases, and 37 per cent said they are hav­ing cash flow prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the sur­vey, re­leased on Tues­day, a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of busi­ness lead­ers – 81 per cent – have now com­pleted a fi­nan­cial re­fore­cast. Of these, 12 per cent pre­dict neg­a­tive rev­enue growth of 50 per cent or more as the most likely out­come from the ex­pected im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Just un­der half (47 per cent) are fo­cus­ing their time on se­cur­ing medium-term sta­bil­ity and op­por­tu­ni­ties for their com­pa­nies over the next one to six months.</p>
    <p>Mr Reuter Chua, head of ACCA Sin­ga­pore, said: “Our data for June re­veals con­tin­ued cash flow challenges, with more than a third in Sin­ga­pore say­ing this is a prob­lem. A sim­i­lar num­ber of busi­nesses are mov­ing now to se­cure ad­di­tional fund­ing.</p>
    <p>“Since the March re­search, the new data re­veals greater con­cerns over fi­nanc­ing and debt is­sues, and given the global eco­nomic cli­mate, it means these will be dif­fi­cult mat­ters to re­solve.”</p>
    <p>He said the key is­sue is a col­lapse in cus­tomer de­mand for many or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“It’s a domino ef­fect, with both prod­uct launches and in­vest­ment plans be­ing de­ferred, fur­ther com­pounded by sup­ply chain challenges and is­sues with cus­tomer or­der ful­fil­ment,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ninety per cent of the pro­fes­sion­als in the sur­vey said they have now adopted flex­i­ble work­ing-from-home strate­gies, and 65 per cent have adopted staff ro­tas to ac­com­mo­date so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment sup­port has been ef­fec­tive, ac­cord­ing to 66 per cent of the re­spon­dents. How­ever, 6 per cent be­lieved the sup­port was in­ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey showed that 32 per cent of the re­spon­dents are also re-eval­u­at­ing their so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity to the wider com­mu­ni­ties af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In terms of guid­ance to cope with dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, ACCA rec­om­mends that the first step is to act to en­sure op­er­abil­ity, then an­a­lyse the sit­u­a­tion ahead by look­ing for op­por­tu­ni­ties and then, fi­nally, comes trans­for­ma­tion of the or­gan­i­sa­tion by es­tab­lish­ing a dig­i­tal strat­egy.</p>
    <p>This en­tails iden­ti­fy­ing the role of tech­nol­ogy to sup­port the fu­ture strate­gic work­force plan vir­tu­ally and phys­i­cally, and how its pres­ence can be sus­tained.</p>
