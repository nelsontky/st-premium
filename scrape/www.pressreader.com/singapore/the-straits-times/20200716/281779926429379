    <p>HONG KONG • Young Hong Kong pro-democ­racy politi­cians vowed yes­ter­day they would not be cowed by China’s new se­cu­rity law and would press ahead with plans to win a ma­jor­ity in the city’s leg­is­la­ture, or Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (Legco).</p>
    <p>Over 600,000 peo­ple turned out at the week­end to choose can­di­dates for up­com­ing leg­isla­tive elec­tions de­spite warn­ings from gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials that the ex­er­cise it­self could breach Bei­jing’s sweep­ing new law.</p>
    <p>The un­of­fi­cial pri­mary vote was an at­tempt by a coali­tion of democ­racy groups to avoid a po­ten­tially dam­ag­ing voter split dur­ing Septem­ber’s polls for the city’s par­tially elected leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>Re­sults re­leased yes­ter­day showed six­teen young fire­brand politi­cians – who have dubbed them­selves the “re­sis­tance camp” and have long been crit­i­cal of Bei­jing – had done es­pe­cially well.</p>
    <p>Older, more tra­di­tional can­di­dates made up a smaller se­lec­tion of the win­ners.</p>
    <p>The young ac­tivists in­clude 23-year-old for­mer stu­dent protest leader Joshua Wong, as well as Mr Jimmy Sham, who helped or­gan­ise last year’s pro-democ­racy ral­lies.</p>
    <p>“The re­sults of the pri­mary elec­tion showed that the re­sis­tance fac­tion has be­come main­stream,” Mr Lester Shum, another for­mer stu­dent leader, told re­porters at a press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“Now our most im­por­tant task is to unite and meet Bei­jing’s pup­pet regime in Hong Kong head on,” he added.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the pri­mary, Bei­jing’s Li­ai­son Of­fice in Hong Kong ac­cused democ­racy ac­tivists of try­ing to launch a rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>It also said that any can­di­dates cam­paign­ing to paral­yse the leg­is­la­ture by win­ning a ma­jor­ity broke an anti-sub­ver­sion clause of the new law.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial line raises the prospect that some can­di­dates might be pros­e­cuted or barred from stand­ing in the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But ac­tivists in­sisted they had the right to block gov­ern­ment leg­is­la­tion if their camp won a ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>“If we are elected a leg­is­la­tor, cast­ing a neg­a­tive vote is part of our law­ful right,” said Mr Fer­gus Le­ung, one of the ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, for­mer law­maker Au Nok Hin said he was with­draw­ing from the group, which or­gan­ised the pri­mary, be­cause of Bei­jing’s threat of pros­e­cu­tion.</p>
    <p>“With­drawal is the only choice that I can pro­tect my­self and oth­ers,” he wrote in a Face­book state­ment.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s leg­is­la­ture is weighted to favour pro-Bei­jing par­ties, with only half the 70 seats di­rectly elected.</p>
