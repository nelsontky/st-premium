    <p>Six new Covid-19 cases were re­ported in Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>This is the low­est re­ported daily num­ber since March 5, which saw five new cases.</p>
    <p>The new cases in­clude four im­ported ones and one in the dor­mi­to­ries. One Sin­ga­porean is the sole com­mu­nity case re­ported yes­ter­day, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nity case was de­tected un­der en­hanced com­mu­nity test­ing of all in­di­vid­u­als aged 13 and above who are di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion at first pre­sen­ta­tion to a doc­tor, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>All the iden­ti­fied close con­tacts of the case have been iso­lated and placed on quar­an­tine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod so that asymp­to­matic cases can be de­tected.</p>
    <p>“We will also con­duct sero­log­i­cal tests for his house­hold con­tacts to de­ter­mine if he could have been in­fected by them,” said MOH.</p>
    <p>Bar­ber Point in River­vale Plaza and the 64+4 food­court in Loyang</p>
    <p>Lane were among places vis­ited by the in­di­vid­ual while he was still in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited them to get those who were at those places at the same time to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>Close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The lat­est in­crease takes Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases to 57,800.</p>
    <p>An­other 28 Covid-19 pa­tients have been dis­charged from hos­pi­tals or com­mu­nity iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties, bring­ing the to­tal of those who have fully re­cov­ered and been dis­charged to 57,547.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently 46 con­firmed cases who are still in hos­pi­tal. Of these pa­tients, most are sta­ble or im­prov­ing and no one is in the in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
    <p>MOH said the over­all num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has in­creased from an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day in the week be­fore to an av­er­age of one case per day in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day in the past two weeks.</p>
