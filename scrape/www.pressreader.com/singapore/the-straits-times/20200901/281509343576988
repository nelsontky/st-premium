    <p>Ten­sions be­tween In­dia and China have flared anew with the In­dian Army say­ing it thwarted an ad­vance by Chi­nese troops along the banks of a lake that strad­dles both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The con­fronta­tion, ac­cord­ing to the In­dian Army, took place on the south­ern bank of Pan­gong Tso lake, which stretches from Ti­bet to Ladakh, an area which has been a ma­jor source of cur­rent fric­tion on the bor­der.</p>
    <p>A source with knowl­edge of the mat­ter on the In­dian side said Chi­nese troops were mov­ing to cap­ture a higher van­tage point to gain a dom­i­nant po­si­tion on the south­ern bank of the 135 km lake.</p>
    <p>The In­dian Army, in an of­fi­cial state­ment, blamed the Chi­nese side for rais­ing ten­sions and car­ry­ing out “provoca­tive mil­i­tary move­ments to change the sta­tus quo”.</p>
    <p>But a spokesman for China’s Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army Western The­atre Com­mand blamed In­dia for the in­cur­sion, say­ing: “We solemnly re­quest the In­dian side to im­me­di­ately with­draw its il­le­gally cross­ing troops, strictly con­trol and re­strain the front-line troops, earnestly abide by its com­mit­ments, and avoid fur­ther es­ca­la­tion of the sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ten­sions be­tween In­dia and China have flared anew with the In­dian Army say­ing it thwarted an ad­vance by Chi­nese troops along the banks of a lake that strad­dles both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries blamed each other for the in­cur­sion.</p>
    <p>The con­fronta­tion, ac­cord­ing to the In­dian Army, took place on the south­ern bank of the pic­turesque Pan­gong Tso lake, which stretches from Ti­bet to Ladakh, an area that has been a ma­jor source of fric­tion. One-third of the lake lies in In­dia and the rest in China, ac­cord­ing to the of­fi­cial web­site of the Ladakh union ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>A source with knowl­edge of the mat­ter on the In­dian side said Chi­nese troops were mov­ing to cap­ture a higher van­tage point to gain a dom­i­nant po­si­tion on the south­ern bank of the 135km lake.</p>
    <p>The In­dian army, in an of­fi­cial state­ment, blamed the Chi­nese side for rais­ing ten­sions and car­ry­ing out “provoca­tive mil­i­tary move­ments”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a spokesman for the Western The­atre Com­mand of the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA), Colonel Zhang Shuili, ac­cused the In­dian Army of il­le­gally cross­ing the bor­der and asked it to with­draw to “avoid fur­ther es­ca­la­tion of the sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>In an of­fi­cial state­ment, In­dian Army spokesman Colonel Aman Anand, said: “On the night of 29/30 Au­gust 2020, PLA troops vi­o­lated the pre­vi­ous con­sen­sus ar­rived at dur­ing mil­i­tary and diplo­matic en­gage­ments dur­ing the on­go­ing stand-off in east­ern Ladakh and car­ried out provoca­tive mil­i­tary move­ments to change the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>“In­dian troops pre-empted this PLA ac­tiv­ity on the south­ern bank of Pan­gong Tso lake, un­der­took mea­sures to strengthen our po­si­tions and thwart Chi­nese in­ten­tions to uni­lat­er­ally change facts</p>
    <p>A spark would be detri­men­tal for the sit­u­a­tion along the bor­der... this is a very del­i­cate, frag­ile and volatile sit­u­a­tion, which can ex­plode if it is not han­dled at the high­est level. ’’</p>

    <p>on the ground.”</p>
    <p>A bri­gade com­man­der level flag meet­ing is in progress at Chushul to re­solve the is­sues, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Many parts of the un­de­mar­cated bor­der in the area be­tween the two coun­tries are the sub­ject of dis­pute.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions have flared up oc­ca­sion­ally but the sit­u­a­tion de­te­ri­o­rated con­sid­er­ably this year, cul­mi­nat­ing in a clash on June 15 in which 20 In­dian soldiers were killed. The Chi­nese did not re­lease ca­su­alty fig­ures af­ter the clash in the Gal­wan Val­ley in Ladakh.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary and diplo­matic talks be­tween the two are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian yes­ter­day said that PLA bor­der troops had never crossed the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol (LAC) and that both sides were en­gaged in con­sul­ta­tions through diplo­matic and mil­i­tary chan­nels.</p>
    <p>In­dia views the cur­rent bor­der flare-up as the worst since 1962, when it went to war with China.</p>
    <p>“We have a very large num­ber of Chi­nese forces and, frankly, we are at a loss,” For­eign Min­is­ter S. Jais­hankar told the Hin­dus­tan Times. “I ac­cept there are some dif­fer­ences in per­cep­tions in the LAC. But there is again a clear un­der­stand­ing that nei­ther side will at­tempt to uni­lat­er­ally change the sta­tus quo.”</p>
    <p>The bor­der is­sue has af­fected the eco­nomic re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two Asian gi­ants, with In­dia mov­ing to in­tro­duce ad­di­tional rules for Chi­nese firms and to re­strict their growth in ar­eas such as telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions and power. China is In­dia’s largest trad­ing part­ner and bi­lat­eral trade hit US$92.68 bil­lion (S$126.1 bil­lion) last year.</p>
    <p>Many an­a­lysts be­lieve the two coun­tries are still far apart and that the sit­u­a­tion re­mains dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>“There is heavy de­ploy­ment on ei­ther side. A spark would be detri­men­tal for the sit­u­a­tion along the bor­der. I would say this is a very del­i­cate, frag­ile and volatile sit­u­a­tion, which can ex­plode if it is not han­dled at the high­est level,” said Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity Pro­fes­sor B. R. Deepak.</p>
    <p>“The diplo­matic and mil­i­tary so­lu­tion may not be the way to re­solve the sit­u­a­tion, it needs in­ter­ven­tion at the high­est level. I think Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi and Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping need to ac­ti­vate the hot­line. This has to be seen in tan­dem with the de­te­ri­o­rat­ing re­la­tions in the field of trade and com­merce,” he added.</p>
