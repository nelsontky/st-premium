    <p>MOS­COW • Krem­lin critic Alexei Navalny, who fell gravely ill last Thurs­day af­ter what his al­lies be­lieve was a poi­son­ing, was un­der in­tense po­lice sur­veil­lance in pre­ced­ing days, a Rus­sian tabloid news­pa­per cited law en­force­ment sources as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­fore he col­lapsed on a flight dur­ing a trip to Siberia, Mr Navalny was fol­lowed by Rus­sian Fed­eral Se­cu­rity Ser­vice plain­clothes of­fi­cers and his move­ments were closely mon­i­tored via closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion, the re­port in the Moskovsky Kom­so­mo­lets news­pa­per said.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny, a long-time op­po­nent of Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin and cam­paigner against cor­rup­tion, was flown in an air am­bu­lance on Satur­day for treat­ment in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old was in an in­duced coma when he was evac­u­ated from the Siberian city of Omsk, but there has been no word yet from the Charite hos­pi­tal in Ber­lin on his con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>His team were due to host a brief­ing via YouTube yes­ter­day evening to dis­cuss “every­thing we know so far about Alexei’s poi­son­ing”, but sub­se­quently can­celled it say­ing they were not ready, press sec­re­tary Kira Yarmysh and cam­paign head­quar­ters head Leonid Volkov wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>But ac­cord­ing to an ally who helped or­gan­ise Mr Navalny’s evac­u­a­tion from Rus­sia to Ber­lin’s Charite hos­pi­tal, Mr Navalny was in “very crit­i­cal” but sta­ble con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of the tests and a prog­no­sis may not be avail­able for sev­eral days, Mr Volkov, his chief of staff, said in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing se­cu­rity ser­vice sources, Moskovsky Kom­so­mo­lets de­scribed the time­line of his trip be­fore he fell ill down to the num­ber of rooms his team had booked in a lo­cal ho­tel and the fact that Mr Navalny chose not to sleep in the room booked un­der his name.</p>
    <p>An apart­ment rented for him by one of his sup­port­ers was dis­cov­ered by po­lice sur­veil­lance, the pa­per re­ported, when a sushi take­away was or­dered to the ad­dress by one of Mr Navalny’s sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>“The scale of the sur­veil­lance does not sur­prise me at all, we were per­fectly aware of it be­fore,” Ms Yarmysh wrote on Twit­ter. “What is sur­pris­ing, how­ever, is that (se­cu­rity ser­vice sources) did not shy away from de­scrib­ing it.”</p>
    <p>His sud­den and se­vere ill­ness has raised sus­pi­cions af­ter a string of Krem­lin crit­ics have be­come vic­tims of poi­son­ing.</p>
    <p>In its re­port, Moskovsky Kom­so­mo­lets cited se­cu­rity sources as say­ing that their sur­veil­lance of Mr Navalny’s move­ments did not re­veal any sus­pi­cious con­tacts that could be re­lated to his ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity ser­vices be­lieve that if Mr Navalny was poi­soned, the in­ci­dent would have taken place ei­ther in the air­port or on the plane, the news­pa­per wrote.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the pa­per said they are still await­ing re­sults of lab­o­ra­tory tests of sam­ples taken by po­lice from all the places Mr Navalny and his team vis­ited on their trip, in­clud­ing sam­ples of the air.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial re­sults are ex­pected to­day, with re­sults from tests for ra­dioac­tive ma­te­rial due later in the week, the pa­per said. It did not say if these would be made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors at the hos­pi­tal in Omsk where Mr Navalny was treated be­fore his evac­u­a­tion to Ger­many have said they do not be­lieve he was poi­soned. They di­ag­nosed him with a meta­bolic dis­ease that may have been caused by low blood sugar.</p>
    <p>Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last Fri­day that it was still un­clear what caused Mr Navalny to fall ill.</p>
    <p>He had pre­vi­ously said that any poi­son­ing would need to be con­firmed by lab­o­ra­tory tests and that doc­tors were do­ing every­thing they could to help Mr Navalny.</p>
    <p>“Only time will tell what the out­come is,” Mr Jaka Bizilj, co-founder of the Cinema for Peace group that fa­cil­i­tated Mr Navalny’s move, said in a phone in­ter­view on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“If he sur­vives, will he be the old Navalny? We’re com­pletely in the dark right now,” said Mr Bizilj.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny’s widely viewed re­ports about cor­rup­tion in Mr Putin’s in­ner cir­cle have made him count­less en­e­mies over the years.</p>
    <p>He has a huge fol­low­ing on so­cial me­dia, with 2.2 mil­lion sub­scribers on Twit­ter alone, and his YouTube chan­nel reg­u­larly posts in­ves­ti­ga­tions that have em­bar­rassed top al­lies of Mr Putin, such as former prime min­is­ter Dmitry Medvedev, for their lav­ish life­styles.</p>
    <p>“No mat­ter whether it’s an at­tempted mur­der or just scare tac­tics, poi­son­ings are pretty much al­ways some­how con­nected to the se­cu­rity ser­vices,” Ms Ta­tiana Stanovaya, head of R. Poli­tik, a po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tancy, said in a so­cial me­dia post.</p>
