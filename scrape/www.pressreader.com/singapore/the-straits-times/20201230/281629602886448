    <p>The part-time Grab driver who was the sole Covid-19 com­mu­nity case on Mon­day has been tem­po­rar­ily sus­pended from the Grab plat­form, in line with the ride-hail­ing op­er­a­tor’s safety pre­cau­tion mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Grab said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that it is work­ing with the Min­istry of Health to pro­vide all nec­es­sary in­for­ma­tion on the man – who also works as a Sin­ga­pore Air­lines cabin crew mem­ber – for con­tact trac­ing pur­poses.</p>
    <p>It added that to en­sure higher safety and hy­giene stan­dards, all its driv­ers have ac­cess to free sani­tiser and dis­in­fec­tant at the Grab Driver Cen­tre. After ev­ery ride, Grab driv­ers and pas­sen­gers can pro­vide feed­back or re­port on any health and hy­giene-re­lated con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a 48-year-old Sin­ga­porean man who re­turned from In­done­sia was one of 13 coro­n­avirus cases an­nounced yes­ter­day, bring­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,542.</p>
    <p>All the coro­n­avirus cases an­nounced yes­ter­day were im­ported, and com­prised one Sin­ga­porean, two per­ma­nent res­i­dents, nine work per­mit hold­ers and one short-term visit pass holder.</p>
    <p>A 71-year-old fe­male per­ma­nent res­i­dent had re­turned from the United States. The other cases re­turned from Bangladesh, In­dia, In­done­sia and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases had been placed on stay-home no­tice or iso­lated on arrival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from worker dor­mi­to­ries yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>No new places were added to the list of lo­ca­tions vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with just one cur­rently un­linked case in the past week.</p>
    <p>With 14 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,385 pa­tients have now fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 37 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, while 76 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
