    <p>Alibaba Group Hold­ing is in talks to in­vest US$3 bil­lion (S$4.1 bil­lion) in South-east Asian ride-hail­ing gi­ant Grab Hold­ings, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese e-com­merce gi­ant, a sole in­vestor in the round, will spend a por­tion of the funds to acquire some of the Grab stock held by Uber Tech­nolo­gies, one of the peo­ple said, ask­ing not to be named as the dis­cus­sions are pri­vate.</p>
    <p>The deal may rep­re­sent one of Alibaba’s big­gest bets on South-east Asia since its first in­vest­ment in Lazada in 2016. China’s largest cor­po­ra­tion has pre­vi­ously made lim­ited for­ays in ride-hail­ing but a po­ten­tial tie-up with Grab gives it ac­cess to data on mil­lions of users in eight coun­tries, a grow­ing de­liv­ery fleet as well as a stake in dig­i­tal wal­let and fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial fund­ing – about a fifth of Grab’s last known val­u­a­tion of US$14 bil­lion – comes amid grow­ing ques­tions over the com­pany’s abil­ity to live up to its lofty price tag as it grap­ples with the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. Grab chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer An­thony Tan has said the firm is fac­ing its “sin­gle big­gest crisis”, while co-founder Tan Hooi Ling warned in May of a “long win­ter”.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing in­vestors have been frus­trated by what they see as value-de­stroy­ing com­pe­ti­tion with Grab’s re­gional arch-ri­val Go­jek.</p>
    <p>The world’s big­gest ride-hail­ing com­pa­nies have waged years of costly bat­tles in their ri­vals’ ter­ri­to­ries be­fore they agreed to stay out of one an­other’s core mar­kets. The truce left Uber with con­sid­er­able stakes in its ri­vals worth more than US$9 bil­lion, in­clud­ing a 23.2 per cent stake in Grab at the end of 2018. Un­der the terms of a deal that Uber struck to exit South-east Asia, Grab is on the hook for more than US$2 bil­lion to the San Fran­cis­cobased com­pany if it does not go pub­lic by mid-2023.</p>
    <p>Mr Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank Group, an in­vestor in all of the world’s big­gest ride-hail­ing com­pa­nies, is at the cen­tre of the dis­cus­sions. The Ja­panese com­pany has used its po­si­tion as a ma­jor share­holder to push Uber to un­load stakes in Grab, Didi Chux­ing of China and Rus­sia’s Yan­dex, the per­son said.</p>
    <p>Uber said in April it would write down about US$2 bil­lion in those in­vest­ments after the pan­demic up­ended the ride-hail­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Grab rep­re­sen­ta­tives de­clined to com­ment, while Uber and SoftBank did not re­ply to queries. Alibaba of­fered no im­me­di­ate com­ment.</p>
    <p>SoftBank has also pushed Grab to make peace with Go­jek. Even as spec­u­la­tion about a pos­si­ble merger has re-sur­faced, the two are far from reach­ing a deal, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter. The ne­go­ti­a­tions are ham­pered by a hos­tile re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two com­pa­nies and the com­plex­ity of co­or­di­nat­ing be­tween so many in­vestors, they said.</p>
    <p>JP­Mor­gan Chase is ad­vis­ing Grab and Gold­man Sachs is ad­vis­ing Go­jek, other peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said. One sce­nario dis­cussed in the past is to po­ten­tially com­bine only the com­pa­nies’ trans­porta­tion busi­ness in In­done­sia, one of them said.</p>
    <p>Grab and Go­jek, val­ued at US$10 bil­lion, are fierce ri­vals with an am­bi­tion to cre­ate an all-in-one “su­per app”. They also com­pete in food de­liv­ery and fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, by far the largest and the most promis­ing mar­ket i n South-east Asia, re­mains the key stick­ing point i n any po­ten­tial merger, with both firms want­ing a ma­jor­ity stake in the merged busi­ness there, ac­cord­ing to the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Go­jek, seen as In­done­sia’s na­tional cham­pion whose app has been down­loaded the most in the coun­try, will not be squeezed into a deal, said an­other per­son fa­mil­iar with the dis­cus­sions. It has in the past de­nied merger spec­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Any deal would also likely face reg­u­la­tory hur­dles be­cause it would com­bine the top two play­ers in the re­gion, re­duc­ing com­pe­ti­tion in ride-hail­ing and newer fields like food de­liv­ery and fi­nance.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic and lock­down mea­sures have bat­tered both com­pa­nies, forc­ing them to cut jobs and stream­line their busi­nesses. Still, Go­jek has pulled in new cap­i­tal from Face­book and PayPal, a show of confidence in its ef­forts to cre­ate a dig­i­tal pay­ments plat­form in the re­gion.</p>
