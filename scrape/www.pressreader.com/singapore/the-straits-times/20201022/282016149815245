    <p>Prospec­tive tourists will soon be able to view 3D mod­els of Sin­ga­pore icons like the Mer­lion from their liv­ing room, as part of an aug­mented re­al­ity (AR) push by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB).</p>
    <p>The tourism board is build­ing a data­base of such con­tent that busi­nesses in the in­dus­try can use to pro­mote Sin­ga­pore as a des­ti­na­tion and en­hance their on-site ex­pe­ri­ence, Mr Poh Chi Chuan, STB’s act­ing chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer, told The Straits Times in an in­ter­view yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This will help lo­cal busi­nesses pro­vide a bet­ter end-to-end ex­pe­ri­ence for vis­i­tors, which will be key in the fu­ture of travel as con­sumers be­come more se­lec­tive in their des­ti­na­tion choices, he said.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses can, for ex­am­ple, use the tech­nol­ogy to give po­ten­tial vis­i­tors a pre­view of their of­fer­ings, down to the lay­out of a ho­tel room. AR can also be used to over­lay in­for­ma­tion or add in­ter­ac­tive el­e­ments at an at­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>While the tech­nol­ogy is not new, it is a use­ful and ac­ces­si­ble tool to en­gage con­sumers as global travel re­stric­tions re­main in place, Mr Poh said, adding that there are many ap­pli­ca­tions for its use.</p>
    <p>“I think com­pa­nies that are able to use AR ef­fec­tively will have an edge when travel re­sumes.”</p>
    <p>The STB is work­ing with the Na­tional Her­itage Board to cre­ate 1,000 3D mod­els of cul­tural and her­itage items, among other things, that can be viewed through a user’s phone cam­era.</p>
    <p>These will be made avail­able to op­er­a­tors through the Tourism In­for­ma­tion and Ser­vices Hub from next year and can be in­te­grated with their web­sites or mobile apps.</p>
    <p>STB’s team of in-house de­vel­op­ers is work­ing on a se­ries of AR pro­to­types to show­case the pos­si­bil­i­ties of the tech­nol­ogy, Mr Poh said, cit­ing an an­i­ma­tion of hawker stalls as one ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>The AR ini­tia­tive is part of a larger</p>
    <p>dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion plan for the tourism in­dus­try, which was an­nounced by Mr Poh dur­ing the vir­tual ITB Asia</p>
    <p>trade show yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said in a speech that the sec­tor is in for a long win­ter, as in­ter­na­tional travel is ex­pected to take three years to re­cover.</p>
    <p>“When re­cov­ery hap­pens, we be­lieve that our tourism land­scape and cus­tomer pro­files will have changed,” he said, adding that it is cru­cial for tourism busi­nesses to start pre­par­ing for this new re­al­ity now.</p>
    <p>To do so, they can use the Tourism Trans­for­ma­tion In­dex, a self-di­ag­nos­tic tool to help busi­nesses as­sess their strengths and iden­tify ar­eas of op­por­tu­nity, to be launched later this year.</p>
    <p>Up­dates will be made to the Sin­ga­pore Tourism An­a­lyt­ics Net­work (Stan) in­for­ma­tion por­tal that will al­low com­pa­nies to bench­mark their per­for­mance against their peers and bet­ter un­der­stand their tar­get au­di­ence, Mr Poh said.</p>
    <p>Data sets such as anonymised ge­olo­ca­tion in­for­ma­tion will be added to the por­tal to pro­vide in­sight on what tourists do while in Sin­ga­pore, he added.</p>
    <p>This will al­low tourism op­er­a­tors to bet­ter plan for their busi­ness needs, he said, adding that the up­com­ing travel bub­ble with Hong Kong will pro­vide use­ful lessons.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore At­trac­tions chair­man Kevin Cheong said the use of AR can add new el­e­ments to at­trac­tions with­out the need for heavy in­vest­ments or ad­di­tional space, though good con­tent re­mains key.</p>
    <p>The tech­nol­ogy can also val­ueadd in prac­ti­cal ways, such as dis­play­ing sign­boards and ex­hibit in­for­ma­tion in a tourist’s first lan­guage, he added. “AR cou­pled with data an­a­lyt­ics to pro­vide in­for­ma­tion on guest en­gage­ment and pref­er­ences would be ideal.”</p>
