    <p>Big­ger Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flats in Bis­han and Toa Payoh (Bi­dadari) have been over­sub­scribed just one day after their launch, even as buy­ers faced is­sues sub­mit­ting ap­pli­ca­tions on the Hous­ing Board web­site. At 5pm yes­ter­day, five-room flats in Toa Payoh’s Bart­ley Bea­con hous­ing project were the most in de­mand.</p>
    <p>Big­ger Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flats in Bis­han and Toa Payoh (Bi­dadari) have been over­sub­scribed just one day after their launch, even as buy­ers faced is­sues sub­mit­ting ap­pli­ca­tions on the Hous­ing Board web­site.</p>
    <p>The HDB web­site was hit by glitches for more than 24 hours after it launched some 5,700 BTO flats and 5,220 Sale of Bal­ance Flats (SBF) at 10am on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day at noon, HDB said in a Face­book post that the is­sues had been re­solved and e-ser­vices were avail­able on its web­site.</p>
    <p>Af­fected buy­ers had com­plained on Face­book that they were un­able to pay the $10 ad­min­is­tra­tive fee to ap­ply for a flat or were un­sure if their pay­ment had gone through. HDB did not spec­ify the cause.</p>
    <p>De­spite the glitches, the big­ger flats in the ma­ture es­tates of Bis­han and Toa Payoh were al­ready heav­ily over­sub­scribed just one day into the one-week sales ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>At 5pm yes­ter­day, five-room flats in Toa Payoh’s Bart­ley Bea­con hous­ing project were the most in de­mand, with more than five ap­pli­cants for each of the 144 units.</p>
    <p>Prices for these flats start from $627,000, ex­clud­ing grants, mak­ing them the most ex­pen­sive units in this launch.</p>
    <p>The to­tal of 910 four-room flats and 184 three-room flats in Bart­ley Bea­con and ParkView @ Bi­dadari – the other BTO project in Toa Payoh – were not yet over­sub­scribed as at yes­ter­day evening, but were ex­pected to see more de­mand.</p>
    <p>The next most pop­u­lar project is Bis­han Ridges, with around two ap­pli­cants for each of the avail­able units. Its 1,222 four-room flats drew 2,606 ap­pli­cants while its 124 three-room flats drew 233 ap­pli­cants. Buy­ers in Bis­han Ridges, which is within walk­ing dis­tance of Bis­han MRT sta­tion, will have to wait the long­est for the flats, with an es­ti­mated com­ple­tion date in the se­cond quar­ter of 2026.</p>
    <p>In Tampines, the 360 four-room flats and 244 five-room flats at</p>
    <p>Tampines GreenEmer­ald were also over­sub­scribed, draw­ing 534 and 356 ap­pli­cants re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>De­mand was just as high in the non-ma­ture es­tate of Sem­bawang, where the 84 three-room, 238 four­room and 184 five-room flats were around two times over­sub­scribed.</p>
    <p>Ten­gah’s two hous­ing projects – Gar­den Court@Ten­gah and Gar­den Ter­race@Ten­gah – proved the least pop­u­lar so far, draw­ing just around the same num­ber of ap­pli­cants as the avail­able flats for four</p>
    <p>room and five-room flat types.</p>
    <p>Flats in Ten­gah will be the ear­li­est to be ready in this launch, around the first quar­ter of 2024.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for the flats close next Mon­day. The flats will be al­lo­cated through bal­lot­ing.</p>
    <p>Next Fe­bru­ary, HDB will launch some 3,500 flats in ar­eas such as Bukit Ba­tok. An­other 3,800 flats will be of­fered in places like Bukit Merah and Wood­lands next May.</p>
