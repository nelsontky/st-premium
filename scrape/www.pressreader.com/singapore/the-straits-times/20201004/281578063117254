    <p>When the Corner­stone Com­mu­nity Church opens its doors to­day, around 100 wor­ship­pers will stream in to each of its au­di­to­ri­ums in Ka­tong and Bugis for ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The church is among some places of wor­ship that started open­ing up to big­ger groups this week­end after safe dis­tanc­ing rules for such venues were eased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The crowd limit has been raised to 100 peo­ple at any one time – dou­ble the pre­vi­ous limit in place since the cir­cuit breaker ended in late</p>
    <p>June. Live mu­sic was also al­lowed at 16 faith or­gan­i­sa­tions as part of a pi­lot pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>De­spite the green light, churches, tem­ples, mosques and other places of wor­ship mostly took a cau­tious ap­proach, with many keep­ing to the lower crowd limit over the first week­end. Wor­ship­pers also did not rush to at­tend ser­vices, with many still wary of crowds.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day morn­ing, the tem­ples in Water­loo Street, typ­i­cally a hive of ac­tiv­ity be­fore Covid-19 hit, saw a trickle of devo­tees.</p>
    <p>Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Tem­ple, the big­gest tem­ple in the area, stopped open­ing on week­ends dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and re­mained closed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There were no crowds at the Bud­dha Tooth Relic Tem­ple in Chi­na­town, which was keep­ing to its rule of not al­low­ing walk-in vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>It was one of a few re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions on the trial for live mu­sic, and sounds of chant­ing em­anated from its cav­ernous prayer hall. But there were few peo­ple in­side; only those who had made ap­point­ments were al­lowed in.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness­man Adam Toh, 47, who was pray­ing out­side the tem­ple with his sons, aged seven and three, said: “This is good enough for us. My kids are young and I am a bit un­easy about bring­ing them to crowded places with Covid-19 still not over.”</p>
    <p>IT se­cu­rity of­fi­cer Veena Govin­daraj, 44, who was at Sri Kr­ish­nan Tem­ple in Water­loo Street, said she hoped it would not get too crowded: “So far the tem­ple is man­ag­ing the crowds very well. I think as long as peo­ple fol­low the safe dis­tanc­ing rules and wear masks, things will be okay.”</p>
    <p>Even places of wor­ship that did open up to more peo­ple had lim­ited their ac­tiv­i­ties, given in­fec­tion risks and con­cerns among wor­ship­pers.</p>
    <p>Corner­stone Com­mu­nity Church, for in­stance, kept phys­i­cal ser­vices to about 45 min­utes com­pared with on­line ones that last over an hour. It also did not play live mu­sic or give com­mu­nion.</p>
    <p>Still, tick­ets for the ser­vices at both its Ka­tong and Bugis lo­ca­tions were snapped up within min­utes when on­line book­ing started.</p>
    <p>Corner­stone’s Pas­tor Lim Lip Yong said: “It’s a great re­prieve for peo­ple to go to church and par­tic­i­pate in some­thing con­gre­ga­tional. But we un­der­stand the need to be cau­tious.”</p>
    <p>BW Monastery, which was also ready to re­ceive more devo­tees, con­tin­ued to hold off on start­ing chant­ing ses­sions.</p>
    <p>These typ­i­cally at­tract up to 300 devo­tees, a num­ber that the monastery could not ac­com­mo­date with safe dis­tanc­ing in place, said chief ex­ec­u­tive Lim Jue Meng.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want to dis­ap­point some of them. If we do it on­line ev­ery­body will get a chance to par­tic­i­pate,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Also, hav­ing hun­dreds of peo­ple chant­ing to­gether will in­crease the risk of Covid-19 and we don’t want to en­dan­ger our devo­tees.”</p>
    <p>Wor­ship­pers at Sri Veera­makaliamma­n Tem­ple in Little In­dia fi­nally got to at­tend prayers where live mu­sic was played. Pre­vi­ously these rit­u­als had been held with­out devo­tees in at­ten­dance.</p>
    <p>Tem­ple sec­re­tary R. Ra­jakanth said devo­tees who were at the tem­ple wel­comed the mu­sic: “Hin­duism is not a silent re­li­gion, it is cen­tred on mu­sic and sounds.”</p>
    <p>The in­crease in crowd lim­its did not make much dif­fer­ence at Taoist tem­ples as devo­tees typ­i­cally visit through­out the day and do not stay long, said Taoist Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Tan Thiam Lye.</p>
    <p>It is only dur­ing spe­cial oc­ca­sions, such as the up­com­ing Nine Em­peror Gods Fes­ti­val, that the tem­ples will see big crowds. Mr Tan said they are al­ready prepar­ing to put up tents and are re­cruit­ing vol­un­teers to help with crowd con­trol.</p>
    <p>Catholic churches and mosques were among places of wor­ship that con­tin­ued to keep to the 50-per­son rule over the week­end.</p>
    <p>The Catholic Church said on its web­site that some parishes will be­gin of­fer­ing 100 places for Mass from Tues­day, “con­tin­gent on the churches hav­ing the rel­e­vant safety man­age­ment plans in place”.</p>
    <p>The Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore said the num­ber of slots avail­able for daily con­gre­ga­tional prayers will be in­creased at 19 mosques from Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>NOT EN­DAN­GER­ING DEVO­TEES</p>
    <p>We don’t want to dis­ap­point some of them. If we do it on­line ev­ery­body will get a chance to par­tic­i­pate... Also, hav­ing hun­dreds of peo­ple chant­ing to­gether will in­crease the risk of Covid-19 and we don’t want to en­dan­ger our devo­tees.</p>
