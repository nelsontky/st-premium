    <p>MELBOURNE • World No. 1 No­vak Djokovic and sec­ond-ranked Rafael Nadal will headline a slimmed-down field at the coro­n­avirus-hit ATP Cup, or­gan­is­ers said, with the tour­na­ment cut in half to 12 teams.</p>
    <p>The cham­pi­onship de­buted across three Aus­tralian cities – Perth, Bris­bane and Syd­ney – last Jan­uary, with 24 na­tions split into six groups ahead of a fi­nals se­ries.</p>
    <p>Djokovic’s Ser­bia emerged tri­umphant, over­pow­er­ing Nadal’s Spain to win the inau­gu­ral ti­tle.</p>
    <p>But the on­slaught of Covid-19 has forced a rad­i­cal change to how the 2021 sea­son will look, with the Aus­tralian Open pushed back by three weeks to Feb 8.</p>
    <p>Play­ers will ar­rive in Aus­tralia from Jan 15 and un­dergo a manda­tory two-week quar­an­tine be­fore the ATP Cup is held along­side two</p>
    <p>WTA 500 and two ATP 250 events, all in Melbourne in the week lead­ing up to the first Grand Slam of the year.</p>
    <p>Teams qual­i­fied for the ATP Cup based on men’s sin­gles rank­ings, with Aus­tria, Rus­sia, Greece, Ger­many, Ar­gentina, Italy, Ja­pan, France and Canada also mak­ing the grade.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia, one of the los­ing semi­fi­nal­ists last year, was in­cluded as host na­tion, but with­out show­man Nick Kyr­gios, who is not on the team sheet.</p>
    <p>All of the world’s top 10 play­ers will take part, ex­cept record 20-time Slam cham­pion Roger Fed­erer, who has pulled out of the Aus­tralian Open for the first time in his ca­reer as he con­tin­ues his re­cov­ery from two rounds of knee surgery.</p>
    <p>ATP Fi­nals cham­pion Daniil Medvedev head­lines a strong Rus­sian team, who reached the semi-fi­nals last year, along­side fel­low top-10 star An­drey Rublev, while world No. 3 Dominic Thiem will try to take Aus­tria to glory.</p>
    <p>“The play­ers are look­ing for­ward to step­ping up and rep­re­sent­ing their coun­tries again, and the field, in­clud­ing de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons Ser­bia and fi­nal­ists Spain, is strong,” said tour­na­ment di­rec­tor Tom Larner.</p>
    <p>“This is a for­mat that shows off the pas­sion of the play­ers and we’re ex­pect­ing some spec­tac­u­lar ten­nis ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>The 12 teams, all of whom fea­tured last year, will be di­vided into four groups of three, with the win­ners of each pro­gress­ing to the semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>Each tie will com­prise two sin­gles matches and one dou­bles match. The draw will be made on Jan 20 ahead of the tour­na­ment start­ing on Feb 1.</p>
    <p>FIRE UP</p>
    <p>This is a for­mat that shows off the pas­sion of the play­ers and we’re ex­pect­ing some spec­tac­u­lar ten­nis ac­tion.</p>
    <p>TOM LARNER, tour­na­ment di­rec­tor, on the in­no­va­tive ATP Cup event.</p>
