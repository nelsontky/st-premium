    <p>The world is soon likely to con­front a se­ri­ous new chal­lenge to the fight against Covid-19: vac­cine hes­i­tancy.</p>
    <p>In the United States and Britain, large num­bers of peo­ple – at least 30 per cent – have said in re­cent sur­veys that they would hes­i­tate to take or refuse a vac­cine that could pro­tect them from the coro­n­avirus and slow its spread.</p>
    <p>These num­bers prob­a­bly un­der­state the prob­lem. Peo­ple might tell a re­searcher that they will get vac­ci­nated even if they won’t. And the prob­lem might be even worse if a vac­cine is made avail­able un­der a speeded-up “emer­gency use” ex­cep­tion to the usu­ally lengthy ap­proval process, am­pli­fy­ing pub­lic con­cerns about rush­ing it out.</p>
    <p>What can be done?</p>
    <p>To an­swer that ques­tion, we need to un­der­stand why some peo­ple are re­luc­tant to take vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Re­search ex­plores the in­flu­ence of three fac­tors, of­ten known as the three Cs.</p>
    <p>The first is con­ve­nience. Hu­man be­ings suf­fer from in­er­tia, and they also pro­cras­ti­nate. If it’s not so easy to get vac­ci­nated, many peo­ple won’t do it.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cal prox­im­ity to vac­ci­na­tion sites helps; so do short wait­ing times. Long lines hurt. So do pa­per­work re­quire­ments and ad­min­is­tra­tive ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>If wide­spread im­mu­nity is the goal, of­fi­cials must not un­der­es­ti­mate the im­por­tance of elim­i­nat­ing in­con­ve­niences, both small and large. The good news is that when vac­cines are eas­ily avail­able, the rate of vac­ci­na­tion increases greatly, even among peo­ple who have doubts.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond fac­tor is com­pla­cency. With re­spect to dis­eases, a lot of peo­ple tend to think that their per­sonal risk is low. “Op­ti­mism bias”, as it is called, makes vac­ci­na­tion seem un­nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The third fac­tor is confidence: pub­lic trust in the ef­fi­cacy and safety of the vac­cine, and also in the mo­ti­va­tions and com­pe­tence of those who are be­hind it.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple dis­trust vac­cines in gen­eral. Many oth­ers dis­trust par­tic­u­lar vac­cines, or new ones, which they might per­ceive to be in­ad­e­quately tested. In ex­treme form, dis­trust turns peo­ple into anti-vax ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>In the con­text of Covid-19, dis­trust might well be a par­tic­u­lar prob­lem, po­ten­tially lead­ing many peo­ple to think, “I am not go­ing to be a hu­man guinea pig”, or at least to wait for some pe­riod be­fore get­ting vac­ci­nated. Dur­ing that wait­ing pe­riod, a lot of peo­ple might get sick.</p>
    <p>For those seek­ing to pro­mote vac­ci­na­tion, the first step is to spec­ify the par­tic­u­lar source of hes­i­tancy, and to learn which is most im­por­tant, and ex­actly where.</p>
    <p>For poor peo­ple, a lack of con­ve­nience might loom large. Among young peo­ple, the main prob­lem might be com­pla­cency. For peo­ple who dis­trust au­thor­ity and sci­ence, and who think that ex­perts have no idea what they are do­ing, the prob­lem is a lack of confidence.</p>
    <p>Con­ve­nience might turn out to be</p>
    <p>the eas­i­est prob­lem to solve. Once a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine is avail­able, it should be a high pri­or­ity to en­sure that it is easy for ev­ery­one to get (start­ing with peo­ple who are at par­tic­u­lar risk). An eco­nomic in­cen­tive, such as a small gift cer­tifi­cate, can help.</p>
    <p>Com­pla­cency is likely to be a spe­cial prob­lem for those who be­lieve, rea­son­ably or not, that their per­sonal mor­tal­ity risk is low.</p>
    <p>A good re­sponse would be to of­fer vivid warn­ings, in­clud­ing truth­ful nar­ra­tives about deaths and se­ri­ous ill­ness among those who are young, healthy and tough. It can also help to em­pha­sise that vac­ci­na­tion pro­tects not only those who get vac­ci­nated, but also oth­ers whom they might oth­er­wise in­fect.</p>
    <p>If young peo­ple think that their own risks are low, they might nonethe­less choose to get</p>
    <p>vac­ci­nated if they are con­vinced that do­ing so will pro­tect some­body’s mother or grand­mother.</p>
    <p>Confidence can be the tough­est nut to crack. Mis­in­for­ma­tion strength­ens pub­lic dis­trust, and with re­spect to a Covid-19 vac­cine, there is bound to be a lot of that.</p>
    <p>And for vac­ci­na­tion, some peo­ple show “re­ac­tance”, which means they have a neg­a­tive at­ti­tude about of­fi­cial re­quests or re­quire­ments – and rebel against them.</p>
    <p>The good news is that it’s pos­si­ble to de­bunk mis­in­for­ma­tion, above all by em­pha­sis­ing facts, and not draw­ing a lot of at­ten­tion to false­hoods (men­tion­ing them, even in the course of a de­bunk­ing ef­fort, can backfire).</p>
    <p>For peo­ple who dis­trust the au­thor­i­ties, an ef­fec­tive re­sponse is to meet them where they are, and</p>
    <p>to ap­peal di­rectly to their sense of so­cial iden­tity or cul­ture. Such re­sponses, some­times de­scribed as “com­mu­nity-based”, in­form peo­ple that their peers, and those with their own val­ues, are get­ting vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Cred­i­ble or sur­pris­ing “val­ida­tors” – high-pro­file peo­ple who are re­spected and ad­mired by those who lack confidence in vac­cines – could be a big help.</p>
    <p>Sup­pose that peo­ple in a com­mu­nity are known to fear that a vac­cine won’t work, or that it is part of some kind of plot, or that it will have ter­ri­ble side-ef­fects. Trusted politi­cians, ath­letes or ac­tors – thought to be “one of us” rather than “one of them” – might ex­plic­itly en­dorse vac­ci­na­tion (and re­port that they them­selves have got the vac­cine).</p>
    <p>It’s ob­vi­ous that sci­en­tific</p>
    <p>ques­tions have sci­en­tific an­swers. It’s less ob­vi­ous that ques­tions about hu­man be­hav­iour also have sci­en­tific an­swers.</p>
    <p>With re­spect to how to pro­mote vac­ci­na­tion, our in­tu­itions of­ten go badly wrong. But there’s a lot of ev­i­dence out there, and in try­ing to pro­tect peo­ple from Covid-19, na­tions can draw on it.</p>
    <p>The chal­lenge, and the op­por­tu­nity, is that ev­ery­one will be in un­charted wa­ters, which means that we have to be flex­i­ble and will­ing to learn what works and what doesn’t.</p>
