    <p>You’ve prob­a­bly bought and sold clothes, ac­ces­sories and even cars or prop­erty on some trad­ing apps.</p>
    <p>Now you can level up by in­vest­ing in gold on a new trad­ing app de­signed to make it eas­ier for just about any­one who wishes to make pas­sive in­come from buy­ing and selling the pre­cious metal.</p>
    <p>The founders of Ever­est</p>
    <p>Gold re­alised that be­sides banks, there were no reg­u­lar channels or trad­ing plat­forms for gold in­vestors to buy and sell gold, es­pe­cially those who are in­ex­pe­ri­enced or who are only com­fort­able with smaller in­vest­ment sums.</p>
    <p>Gold has tra­di­tion­ally been viewed as a safe haven in­vest­ment through­out the cen­turies, act­ing as a form of liq­uid in­sur­ance against ad­verse eco­nomic con­di­tions such as wartime, fi­nan­cial cri­sis and health pan­demics like the cur­rent Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>And ac­cord­ing to re­search com­mis­sioned by the</p>
    <p>World Gold Coun­cil, gold prices gen­er­ally rise in both in­fla­tion­ary sce­nar­ios as well as in lower in­fla­tion sce­nar­ios be­cause of its low cor­re­la­tion with other as­sets.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in most cases, there are high bar­ri­ers to in­vest­ing in gold. Ever­est</p>
    <p>Gold aims to bring down those bar­ri­ers and make gold in­vest­ing more ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able to most of us.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the Ever­est Gold trad­ing plat­form has no trans­ac­tion fees and you do not need any trad­ing ex­pe­ri­ence to get started. The bonus: You can buy as lit­tle as 0.01g of gold.</p>
    <p>To do so, sim­ply cre­ate an ac­count on your lap­top or mo­bile, or down­load the Ever­est Gold in­vest­ment app, and start trad­ing. The key is to buy gold at low prices — there are even Gold Sub­scrip­tion Events where you get to pur­chase the pre­cious metal at spe­cial prices — and sell when they rise. Then, with a few clicks, with­draw your rev­enue in­stantly from your ac­count. You can also col­lect gold and store it in Ever­est Gold’s se­cure vault.</p>
    <p>And how safe is it to trade gold with Ever­est Gold?</p>
    <p>The com­pany has en­tered into a tri­par­tite su­per­vi­sion ar­range­ment with Pa­cific Trustees Sin­ga­pore and in­ter­na­tional gold vault chain Malca-Amit to jointly su­per­vise the gold pur­chased. This means that nei­ther party can ex­er­cise rights over the pur­chases to en­sure op­ti­mal in­vest­ment safety.</p>
    <p>Ever­est Gold is also a reg­u­lated dealer of pre­cious met­als in Sin­ga­pore, fully reg­u­lated and li­censed by the Sin­ga­porean PSPM Act of 2019, le­gally ap­proved by the Min­istry of Law.</p>
    <p>To sign up for a gold trad­ing ac­count, visit http://mar­ket. ever­est.gold or down­load the app.</p>
