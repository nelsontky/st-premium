    <p>They de­fended against “enemy” air­craft at­tacks and co­or­di­nated si­mul­ta­ne­ous flights of manned he­li­copters and un­manned ae­rial ve­hi­cles (UAVs) at sea – these sce­nar­ios put mem­bers of the Sin­ga­pore and Aus­tralian navies to the test dur­ing the lat­est Ex­er­cise Sin­ga­roo.</p>
    <p>Other than hon­ing com­pe­ten­cies, the bi­en­nial ex­er­cise be­tween the Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Navy (RSN) and the Royal Aus­tralian Navy – now in its 25th year – has been a plat­form to build­ing en­dur­ing friend­ships with a re­gional neigh­bour, RSN crew told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Colonel Ho Jee Kien, 45, com­man­der of the 8th Flotilla and deputy com­man­der of the ex­er­cise task group, said the com­plex­ity of the ex­er­cise has in­creased in the past 25 years, partly be­cause the ships used by both navies have changed.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Sin­ga­pore’s sub­marines, naval he­li­copters and frigates were grad­u­ally in­cluded as they be­came op­er­a­tionalised.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, we’re able to de­sign this ex­er­cise to have a larger scope, in­volv­ing dif­fer­ent kinds of ca­pa­bil­i­ties, and to stretch our abil­ity to con­duct op­er­a­tions at sea,” he said.</p>
    <p>The three-day ex­er­cise, in­au­gu­rated in 1995, con­cluded on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>This year, the RSN took part with a For­mi­da­ble-class frigate, RSS Tena­cious; two Vic­tory-class mis­sile corvettes, RSS Valiant and RSS Val­our, with ScanEa­gle UAVs on board; and a sub­ma­rine.</p>
    <p>The In­de­pen­dence-class lit­toral mis­sion ves­sel (LMV) RSS Daunt­less also made its de­but in the ex­er­cise, which was held in the south­ern reaches of the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Sailors from both navies were tested over three days in var­i­ous sce­nar­ios, in­clud­ing pro­tect­ing an oil tanker from a sub­ma­rine “threat” and mount­ing a de­fence against two Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Air Force F-16 fighter jets.</p>
    <p>An Aus­tralian he­li­copter also flew in the same area as the ScanEa­gle, to pro­vide sur­veil­lance ca­pa­bil­i­ties – a com­plex ma­noeu­vre that re­quired real-time co­or­di­na­tion be­tween both sides.</p>
    <p>“You will not be able to do these un­less you re­ally un­der­stand each other. And this takes time, and many edi­tions of ex­er­cises to build up. I think this is the out­come of what I call 25 years of part­ner­ship,” said Col Ho.</p>
    <p>The in­clu­sion of an LMV for the first time showed off the mod­u­lar na­ture of the ship, he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s LMVs are typ­i­cally de­ployed for mar­itime se­cu­rity op­er­a­tions like pa­trols in its waters, al­though they can also be con­fig­ured for other op­er­a­tions, such as pro­tec­tion of sea lanes of com­mu­ni­ca­tion, dis­as­ter relief and con­ven­tional war­fare.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pre­cau­tions taken by the par­tic­i­pat­ing RSN crew in­cluded ad­her­ing to seg­re­gated work, rest and eat­ing ar­eas on board ships with min­i­mal in­ter­ac­tion among the crews of dif­fer­ent groups.</p>
    <p>Per­son­nel also had to keep to stay-home re­stric­tion or­ders for seven days be­fore the over­seas de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>They were al­lowed to go home only af­ter serv­ing on board their ships and leave home only for es­sen­tial trips.</p>
    <p>There was also no phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion be­tween the two navies, al­though ships from both sides per­formed a sail­past and came within 300m of each other.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a vir­tual i nter­view on Wed­nes­day, RSN crew in­volved spoke about the ex­pe­ri­ence, as well as how the ex­er­cise was dif­fer­ent be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary Ex­pert 2 Jee­van Raj, 29, who is a nav­i­ga­tion su­per­vi­sor on RSS Daunt­less, de­scribed the ex­er­cise as a mile­stone for his ship.</p>
    <p>He is among its pi­o­neer crew that par­tic­i­pated in tri­als be­fore the LMV was com­mis­sioned ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Another par­tic­i­pant, Third Sergeant She­mael Matthews, said Ex­er­cise Sin­ga­roo honed his skills as an UAV op­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the sail­past con­ducted dur­ing sun­set, we lined up along the up­per deck of the ship and saw the Aus­tralians wav­ing back – I felt it was a re­ally nice ges­ture and some­thing re­ally mem­o­rable,” said the 20-year-old full-time na­tional ser­vice­man.</p>
