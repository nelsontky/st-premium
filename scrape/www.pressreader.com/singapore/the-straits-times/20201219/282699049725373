    <p>A di­rec­tor of a com­pany that deals with elec­tri­cal and metal sub­con­tract­ing works has be­come the first per­son here to be sent to jail for giv­ing false in­for­ma­tion to the In­land Rev­enue Authority of Sin­ga­pore (Iras).</p>
    <p>For his of­fences, Law Yu Hong, a di­rec­tor of a com­pany called Ho Sin, was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to 10 days’ jail and a fine of $5,000. He was also or­dered to pay a penalty of $38,400 – twice the amount he had tried to fraud­u­lently ob­tain through a ruse in­volv­ing a govern­ment pro­duc­tiv­ity scheme.</p>
    <p>The 53-year-old Sin­ga­porean had ear­lier ad­mit­ted that he had given false in­for­ma­tion to Iras dur­ing the course of in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>He also ad­mit­ted to abet­ting Ho Sin in pro­vid­ing false in­for­ma­tion to the Comp­trol­ler of In­come Tax in its cash pay­out ap­pli­ca­tion form for the Pro­duc­tiv­ity and In­no­va­tion Credit (PIC) scheme.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive was in­tro­duced in 2010 to en­cour­age busi­nesses to in­vest in pro­duc­tiv­ity and in­no­va­tion. The scheme, which ended in 2018, of­fered tax de­duc­tions or cash pay­outs to com­pa­nies that made gen­uine in­vest­ments to en­hance pro­duc­tiv­ity and in­no­va­tion, such as by in­vest­ing in staff train­ing, in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy or au­to­ma­tion equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Law’s case is linked to that of Ng Cheow Chai, 47, who was the manag­ing di­rec­tor of equip­ment whole­saler SMS Ma­chin­ery at the time of the of­fences. Ng was also the mas­ter­mind be­hind the largest case of fraud in­volv­ing the PIC scheme.</p>
    <p>Ng had helped 83 busi­nesses sub­mit fraud­u­lent claims to the scheme be­tween March 2013 and July 2016, seek­ing pay­outs to­talling $2.7 mil­lion that they were not en­ti­tled to.</p>
    <p>He was sen­tenced to 46 months’ jail in March and or­dered to pay a penalty of $5.75 mil­lion – four times the amount of the pay­outs wrong­fully ob­tained.</p>
    <p>He has to spend an ad­di­tional 311/ months be­hind bars if he is un­able to pay the amount.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Law had ear­lier con­tacted Ng to buy a shear­ing ma­chine for Ho Sin.</p>
    <p>Tax pros­e­cu­tor Irene Kuek from Iras said: “Sub­se­quently, (Ng) pre­sented to the ac­cused a pro­posal to sub­mit an in­flated PIC claim to Iras to ob­tain a higher PIC cash pay­out such that (Ho Sin) would not need to pay a sin­gle cent for the new ma­chine. The ac­cused agreed to the pro­posal.”</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, Iras said that Ho Sin forged com­mer­cial doc­u­ments to cre­ate a false trans­ac­tion be­tween it and Ng’s busi­ness. A form was then sub­mit­ted in 2016, falsely stat­ing that the ma­chine cost $80,000 when its ac­tual price was $48,000.</p>
    <p>The pay­out was not dis­bursed fol­low­ing an au­dit, and Iras be­gan an in­ves­ti­ga­tion against Law. He lied dur­ing the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, claim­ing the trans­ac­tion was gen­uine.</p>
