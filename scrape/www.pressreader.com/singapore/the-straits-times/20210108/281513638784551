    <p>KEEN IN­TER­EST EX­PECTED</p>
    <p>Be­sides res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ers who will be keen to sub­di­vide the site into mul­ti­ple landed homes, we also ex­pect in­ter­est from high-net-worth and multi-gen­er­a­tional fam­i­lies look­ing to buy for their own stay.</p>
    <p>MS SWEE SHOU FERN, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of in­vest­ment ad­vi­sory at Ed­mund Tie, on how the property is “an ex­cep­tional op­por­tu­nity for im­me­di­ate re­de­vel­op­ment”.</p>
    <p>The house that for­mer China tour guide Yang Yin nearly cheated from a rich Sin­ga­porean wi­dow is up for sale again, at a lower price of $25 mil­lion, or about $785 per sq ft (psf) on land area.</p>
    <p>The property was put up for sale by real es­tate con­sult­ing firm Ed­mund Tie yes­ter­day, nearly three years af­ter the pre­vi­ous ten­der in Fe­bru­ary 2018.</p>
    <p>Madam Chung Khin Chun’s bun­ga­low in Ger­ald Cres­cent, off Yio Chu Kang Road, sits on a 31,882 sq ft plot of land – about the size of half a foot­ball field. It has a 999-year lease that be­gan in 1879.</p>
    <p>The 2018 sale by ten­der by es­tate agency Sav­ills Sin­ga­pore was un­suc­cess­ful as nei­ther of the two bids met the ex­pected price of $35 mil­lion, or $1,100 psf on land area.</p>
    <p>Madam Chung’s niece and guardian Hedy Mok, now 67, had told The Straits Times then that she had hold­ing power to wait so she did not sell the house.</p>
    <p>Madam Chung, now 94, had been em­broiled in a bit­ter, high­pro­file dis­pute with Yang over her as­sets, in­clud­ing the property.</p>
    <p>Act­ing as tour guide for the re</p>
    <p>tired phys­io­ther­a­pist when she vis­ited China in 2008, Yang moved into her bun­ga­low a year later, brought his fam­ily to Sin­ga­pore and got the wi­dow to make a will that al­lowed him to in­herit everything.</p>
    <p>Yang’s crimes sur­faced in Septem­ber 2014 af­ter a seven-hour stand-off between the wi­dow and his wife.</p>
    <p>He pleaded guilty in Au­gust 2016 to mis­ap­pro­pri­at­ing $1.1 mil­lion from Madam Chung and fal­si­fy­ing re­ceipts for a sham com­pany to stay here and ob­tain per­ma­nent res­i­dency.</p>
    <p>He was sen­tenced to 11 years and two months in jail.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, Madam Mok said her aunt has been living with her at her semi-detached house in East Coast for the past six years.</p>
    <p>“She is com­fort­able and happy, and has come to re­gard my house as her home. She is aware that the bun­ga­low is be­ing put up for sale again,” added Madam Mok, who would not com­ment on the guide price of the house or the pro­ceeds.</p>
    <p>Property ex­perts at­trib­uted the lower ask­ing price of $25 mil­lion this year to sev­eral dif­fer­ences between 2018 and the fourth quar­ter of last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Ni­cholas Mak, ERA Re­alty’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy, said the hous­ing mar­ket in the first quar­ter of 2018 was “quite bullish”, but hous­ing prices fell af­ter cooling mea­sures were in­tro­duced in July that year.</p>
    <p>He added that while landed property prices rose by 11 per cent from the start of 2018 to the end of last year, the eco­nomic cli­mate to­day is still weaker due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Mr Ku Swee Yong, chief ex­ec­u­tive of In­ter­na­tional Property Ad­vi­sor, said the auc­tion in 2018 was prob­a­bly priced for a strong econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“Given the cur­rent lim­its on landed property de­vel­op­ment, rel­a­tively high de­vel­op­ment charges payable to the au­thor­i­ties, cou­pled with the un­cer­tain eco­nomic out­look, I be­lieve this $25 mil­lion... is a rea­son­able price,” said Mr Ku.</p>
    <p>Ms Swee Shou Fern, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of in­vest­ment ad­vi­sory at Ed­mund Tie, said that the Ger­ald Cres­cent property “presents an ex­cep­tional op­por­tu­nity for im­me­di­ate re­de­vel­op­ment”.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ers who will be keen to sub­di­vide the site into mul­ti­ple landed homes, we also ex­pect in­ter­est from high­net-worth and multi-gen­er­a­tional fam­i­lies look­ing to buy for their own stay,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ten­der for the land near Yio Chu Kang Road will close on Feb 9 at 3pm.</p>
