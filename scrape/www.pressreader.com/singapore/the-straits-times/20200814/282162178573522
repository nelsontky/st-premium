    <p>NEW YORK • The Au­gusta Na­tional Golf Club an­nounced on Wed­nes­day that this year’s Masters, post­poned from its tra­di­tional April date to Nov 12-15, will be held with­out pa­trons or guests in at­ten­dance.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion was made be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and came after an ear­lier de­ci­sion by the PGA Tour to bar fans for the re­main­der of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Few other golf tour­na­ments have a widely known phrase to de­scribe the fan pres­ence, but the “Au­gusta roars” – the re­sound­ing crowd re­sponse that echoes around the course – have be­come syn­ony­mous with the Masters per­haps as much as its bloom­ing aza­leas.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there will not be a gallery when 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion Tiger Woods tees off the defence of his Masters ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Au­gusta’s de­ci­sion – the last of the Ma­jors to say it would pro­ceed with­out spec­ta­tors – could sig­nal that will be the norm even into next sea­son.</p>
    <p>The first two events of next sea­son, the Safe­way Open and San­der­son Farms Cham­pi­onship, have al­ready an­nounced that they will not have fans on site dur­ing their Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber dates.</p>
    <p>“Through­out this process, we have con­sulted health of­fi­cials and a va­ri­ety of sub­ject mat­ter ex­perts,” said Fred Ri­d­ley, chair­man of Au­gusta Na­tional.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, we de­ter­mined that the po­ten­tial risks of wel­com­ing pa­trons and guests to our grounds in Novem­ber are sim­ply too sig­nif­i­cant to over­come.</p>
    <p>“Even in the cur­rent cir­cum­stances, stag­ing the Masters with­out pa­trons is deeply dis­ap­point­ing.</p>
    <p>“The guests who come to Au­gusta each spring from around the world are a key com­po­nent to mak­ing the tour­na­ment so spe­cial.</p>
    <p>“Au­gusta has the re­spon­si­bil­ity, how­ever, to un­der­stand and ac­cept the chal­lenges as­so­ci­ated with this virus and take the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions to con­duct all as­pects of the tour­na­ment in a safe man­ner.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, 12-time PGA Tour win­ner Zach John­son, who is known for his gra­cious de­meanour and good sports­man­ship, was named the re­cip­i­ent of this year’s Payne Ste­wart Award on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The hon­our is given an­nu­ally to a player shar­ing the late Ste­wart’s re­spect for the tra­di­tions of the game and his com­mit­ment to up­hold golf’s her­itage of char­i­ta­ble sup­port.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Huge crowds were on hand to cheer Tiger Woods as he cel&#xAD;e&#xAD;brated last year&#x2019;s Masters win. Fans will be barred from this year&#x2019;s de&#xAD;layed edi&#xAD;tion in Novem&#xAD;ber due to Covid-19.</p>
