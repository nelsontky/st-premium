    <p>BEI­JING • China will put sanc­tions on Lock­heed Martin for its in­volve­ment in the lat­est US arms sale to Chi­nese-claimed Tai­wan, Bei­jing said yes­ter­day, adding ten­sion to its trou­bled re­la­tion­ship with the United States.</p>
    <p>The US weapons maker is the main con­trac­tor for a US$620 mil­lion (S$864 mil­lion) up­grade pack­age for Tai­wan’s Pa­triot sur­faceto-air mis­siles, which the US gov­ern­ment ap­proved last week.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian also called on the United States to stop selling weapons to Tai­wan to “avoid fur­ther harm­ing Sino-US ties and peace and sta­bil­ity in the Tai­wan Strait”.</p>
    <p>“In or­der to safe­guard the coun­try’s in­ter­ests, China has de­cided to take nec­es­sary steps, and put sanc­tions on the main con­trac­tor for this sale, Lock­heed Martin,” Mr Zhao told reporters, with­out giv­ing de­tails.</p>
    <p>The com­pany did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The United States, like most coun­tries, has no of­fi­cial diplo­matic ties with Tai­wan, but is bound by law to pro­vide the demo­cratic is­land with the means to de­fend it­self.</p>
    <p>China has an­nounced sim­i­lar sanc­tions be­fore on Amer­i­can com­pa­nies for Tai­wan arms sales, though it is un­clear what form they have taken.</p>
    <p>The US has long had an arms em­bargo on China.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment in Tai­wan has wel­comed the mis­sile up­grade.</p>
    <p>It is bol­ster­ing its de­fences for what it sees as in­creas­ingly threat­en­ing moves by Bei­jing, such as its reg­u­lar air force and naval ex­er­cises near Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan De­fence Min­is­ter Yen Teh-fa, vis­it­ing troops dur­ing the an­nual Han Kuang mil­i­tary ex­er­cise this week, said they needed to be strong in the face of “all sorts of threats and provo­ca­tions” from China.</p>
    <p>“This tells our peo­ple and the Com­mu­nists that we have the con­fi­dence and abil­ity to pro­tect our peo­ple and home­land, and de­fend the coun­try’s se­cu­rity,” his min­istry cited him as say­ing.</p>
    <p>While Tai­wan’s mil­i­tary is well­trained and well-equipped with mostly US-made hard­ware, China has huge nu­mer­i­cal su­pe­ri­or­ity and is adding ad­vanced equip­ment of its own such as stealth fight­ers and new bal­lis­tic mis­siles.</p>
