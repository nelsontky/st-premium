    <p>For Mr Ab­hi­jeet Ku­mar, Covid-19 could not have come at a worse time. As soon as the In­dian govern­ment im­posed a lockdown to bat­tle the coro­n­avirus in March, he lost his cus­tomer ser­vice job in a mall in Patna, the cap­i­tal of Bi­har.</p>
    <p>With an un­well mother back home in the small town of Gopal­ganj, a father laid off from a con­struc­tion com­pany in Dubai, and a school-go­ing brother, the weight of fi­nan­cial pres­sures sat heav­ily on the 19-year-old’s shoul­ders.</p>
    <p>In the eco­nomic crash that came with the lock­downs, over 41 mil­lion Indians like Mr Ku­mar lost their jobs. Mi­grant work­ers kicked out of of­fices and malls in big cities walked back miles to their vil­lages across the coun­try. In the first week of May, In­dia’s over­all unem­ploy­ment rate rose as high as 27.11 per cent.</p>
    <p>A crop of new web­sites and apps are now try­ing to help the newly job­less mil­lions. Some are by state gov­ern­ments, oth­ers by en­trepreneur­s who are tweak­ing tech­no­log­i­cal so­lu­tions they were al­ready build­ing for blue-col­lar work­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ku­mar signed up to one called Job­s­gaar, a web­site in English and Hindi that con­nects job seek­ers to lo­cal traders and small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises in Tier 2 and 3 towns. One list­ing from a mo­tor­cy­cle agency 6km from Mr Ku­mar’s home caught his eye: “Wanted sales­man with min­i­mum 6 mons (sic) ex­pe­ri­ence. Salary Rs. 12,000.” That amount is about $223.</p>
    <p>He promptly ap­plied. Af­ter a face-to-face in­ter­view in which he re­vealed ad­di­tional photo-edit­ing skills, he was hired.</p>
    <p>“I ride to work in 20 min­utes. I stay with fam­ily. I even take a lunch box to work. I earn the same salary I did ear­lier but I save more. I also have time to restart the sci­ence de­gree I gave up,” said Mr Ku­mar.</p>
    <p>This is ex­actly what Job­s­gaar founder Atul Pratap Singh had en­vi­sioned. Hail­ing from a small town in Ut­tar Pradesh him­self, he found chemists and small fac­tory own­ers look­ing for work­ers, while young job seek­ers mi­grated to met­ro­pol­i­tan cities in search of a liveli­hood.</p>
    <p>“The prime is­sue for 450 mil­lion</p>
    <p>Indians in the semi-for­mal work­force is not lack of skill but the void be­tween op­por­tu­nity and work­force,” said Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>In­dia faced an unem­ploy­ment cri­sis even be­fore the pan­demic, hitting 6.1 per cent in 2017-2018, the high­est in 45 years. The Covid-19 lock­downs have ex­ac­er­bated this, trig­ger­ing a re­verse mi­gra­tion of the work­force to vil­lages.</p>
    <p>Job­s­gaar launched its por­tal in July, at the height of the cri­sis, fo­cus­ing on jobs in Ut­tar Pradesh, Bi­har and As­sam – states that a ma­jor­ity of blue-col­lar mi­grants are from and have now re­turned to.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh re­called the first job list­ing was for a tyre punc­ture as­sis­tant in Kan­pur for a pay of 8,000 ru­pees.</p>
    <p>In 55 days, 10,000 ap­pli­cants and more than 300 busi­nesses signed up on Job­s­gaar. More than 90 per cent are from small towns.</p>
    <p>“We’ll be launch­ing a new fea­ture soon where peo­ple can cre­ate a vis­ual re­sume, like a TikTok video, in which they in­tro­duce them­selves and their skills,” said Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>Another app, Apna (Ours), which calls it­self “the LinkedIn for blue­and grey-col­lar work­ers”, has list­ings, but also vir­tual com­mu­ni­ties for each of its 60 job types, such as driv­ers, nurses and plumbers.</p>
    <p>“So­cial and work lives are very strongly linked in this job mar­ket. We try to repli­cate these trust net­works vir­tu­ally,” said Mr Nir­mit Parikh, founder of the Apna app. Job seek­ers chat with one another about op­por­tu­ni­ties, of­fer help and warn about cheating em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Ad­ver­tis­ing agency Lowe Lin­tas launched an app called Kaam Wa­pasi (Re­turn to Work) with jobs from Mumbai, Delhi and Ban­ga­lore in con­struc­tion, de­liv­ery, restau­rants and fac­tory shop floors.</p>
    <p>Mr Vi­rat Tan­don, Mul­lenLowe Lin­tas’ group chief ex­ec­u­tive, called Kaam Wa­pasi “a col­lab­o­ra­tion of like-minded cor­po­rates”. Telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pany Air­tel pushes text mes­sages about jobs, Zee Net­work car­ries free ads on its Hindi chan­nels, Axis Bank of­fers on­line pay­ment ser­vices, and Ra­zor­pod wrote the app’s code for no charge.</p>
    <p>“Big com­pa­nies hir­ing may not have many va­can­cies, but are of­fer­ing bet­ter pay (than they were ear­lier), per­ma­nent con­tracts, ac­com­mo­da­tion and bet­ter ben­e­fits now to at­tract ex­pe­ri­enced mi­grant work­ers,” said Mr Tan­don.</p>
    <p>All the tech so­lu­tions cur­rently do not charge fees. Said Mr Singh: “We have a rev­enue model that we’ll get to, but only af­ter the cri­sis is over.”</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments are step­ping up, too. In Haryana, a state call cen­tre is con­tact­ing about 100,000 un­em­ployed peo­ple who reg­is­tered with the state em­ploy­ment de­part­ment to match them with job va­can­cies.</p>
    <p>The Delhi govern­ment launched its own jobs web­site on July 27. Today, it has 1.1 mil­lion job seek­ers and more than 810,000 ac­tive va­can­cies in 32 cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>“Built for the tar­get seg­ment, it’s a no-frills web­site in Hindi and English that works well on a mo­bile browser. You just fill a short form and in a cou­ple of min­utes, start search­ing for jobs,” said Mr Jasmine Shah, vice-chair­man of the Delhi govern­ment’s pol­icy think-tank.</p>
    <p>But the suc­cess rate of ap­pli­cants is dif­fi­cult to mea­sure, said Mr Shah. On a central govern­ment app launched by Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi, more than 6.9 mil­lion peo­ple reg­is­tered in 40 days, but only 691 took the jobs of­fered.</p>
    <p>Mr Ku­mar said young work­ers like him are more vig­i­lant today.</p>
    <p>“In the lockdown, we saw em­ploy­ers aban­don us. We need in­come, but we won’t sell our­selves cheap any more.”</p>
