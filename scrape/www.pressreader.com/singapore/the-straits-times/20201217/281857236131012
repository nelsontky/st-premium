    <p>PUTRAJAYA Malaysia’s King yes­ter­day gave his con­sent for an emer­gency to be de­clared in two con­stituen­cies in Perak and Sabah, to postpone by-elec­tions in the two seats.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said the Cabi­net had pre­sented its views to the King on the polls in Gerik (Perak) and Bu­gaya (Sabah), which were slated to be held si­mul­ta­ne­ously on Jan 16.</p>
    <p>This was the third post­pone­ment of a by-elec­tion, with Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah pre­vi­ously declar­ing a lo­cal emer­gency to de­lay polls for the Batu Sapi par­lia­men­tary seat in Sabah.</p>
    <p>“The Yang di-Per­tuan Agong (King) has given his con­sent for an emer­gency to be de­clared for both by-elec­tions,” Tan Sri Muhyid­din said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“On Dec 4, the Cabi­net dis­cussed... the con­se­quences of hold­ing the Gerik and Bu­gaya by-elec­tions if the Covid-19 pan­demic was still widespread in the coun­try. Learn­ing from the les­son of the (virus) out­break that was brought about by the Sabah by-elec­tion (in Septem­ber), the Cabi­net feels that these two by-elec­tions should be avoided, due to health, liveli­hood and pub­lic or­der fac­tors.”</p>
    <p>In declar­ing the Batu Sapi emer­gency, of­fi­cials said life would go on as usual in the ward with the health pro­to­cols in place, with only the by-elec­tion post­poned.</p>
    <p>The Gerik fed­eral Par­lia­ment seat be­came va­cant af­ter its in­cum­bent MP Datuk Has­bul­lah Os­man died of a heart at­tack on Nov 16. The fol­low­ing day, Madam Ma­nis Muka Mohd Darah, who rep­re­sented the Bu­gaya state seat, died due to kid­ney com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The Batu Sapi fed­eral seat was de­clared va­cant fol­low­ing the death of for­mer min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s De­part­ment Liew Vui Keong on Oct 2.</p>
