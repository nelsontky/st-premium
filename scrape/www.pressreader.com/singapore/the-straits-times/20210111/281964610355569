    <p>Up to last year, SP al­lowed its cus­tomers to en­rol for re­cur­ring credit card pay­ments with DBS/POSB.</p>
    <p>But last year, it in­formed them that it would switch the pay­ment plat­form used to process the re­cur­ring credit card pay­ments to the SP Util­i­ties app.</p>
    <p>When I called SP last year, I was told that I could do the switch on SP’s web­site on Jan 1 this year, via a PC or lap­top as an al­ter­na­tive to us­ing a smart­phone to down­load the app.</p>
    <p>But on Jan 1, I found it was not so. The only way to set up the pay­ment is to down­load the app via a smart­phone.</p>
    <p>Would the au­thor­i­ties please com­ment on whether Sin­ga­pore’s dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion jour­ney is now at the point where other modes of In­ter­net trans­ac­tion are dis­al­lowed and ev­ery­one is forced onto smart­phones?</p>
    <p>I am puz­zled as to why peo­ple are not al­lowed to use their PCs or lap­tops in­stead.</p>
    <p>To make mat­ters worse, the credit card will now be charged seven days be­fore the pay­ment due date. Pre­vi­ously, the card was charged on the same day as the pay­ment due date.</p>
    <p>Why has the charge date been brought for­ward?</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond case of a Gov­ern­ment-linked en­ter­prise giv­ing the public no al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>The ear­lier case was that of Sing­tel, which did not al­low the pa­per op­tion for the elec­tion of scrip div­i­dends, cit­ing that it had more than 1.1 mil­lion share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>This does not give the mi­nor­ity a way out if they have no com­puter or smart­phone to use the In­ter­net.</p>
