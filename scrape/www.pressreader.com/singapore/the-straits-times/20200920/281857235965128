    <p>BER­LIN • The first known death from a cy­ber at­tack has been re­ported af­ter cy­ber crim­i­nals hit a hospi­tal in Dus­sel­dorf, Ger­many, with so-called ran­somware, in which hack­ers en­crypt data and hold it hostage un­til the vic­tim pays a ran­som.</p>
    <p>The ran­somware in­vaded 30 servers at Univer­sity Hospi­tal Dus­sel­dorf last week, crash­ing sys­tems and forc­ing the hospi­tal to turn away emer­gency pa­tients. As a re­sult, the Ger­man au­thor­i­ties said, a woman in life-threat­en­ing con­di­tion was sent to a hospi­tal 32km away in Wup­per­tal and died from treat­ment de­lays.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals have been a fre­quent tar­get of cy­ber­crime, par­tic­u­larly ran­somware at­tacks, be­cause the need to access health records and com­puter sys­tems cre­ates ur­gency that in­creases the like­li­hood that vic­tims will pay their ex­tor­tion­ists.</p>
    <p>“Hos­pi­tals can’t af­ford down­time, which means they may be more likely to pay – and quickly with min­i­mal ne­go­ti­a­tion – to re­store their services,” said Mr Brett Cal­low, a threat an­a­lyst at Em­sisoft, a New Zealand se­cu­rity firm, on Fri­day. “That makes them a prime tar­get.”</p>
    <p>The most ag­gres­sive re­ported at­tacks on health­care fa­cil­i­ties so far were North Korea’s “Wan­naCry” ran­somware strike in 2017, which froze Bri­tish hos­pi­tals and forced doc­tors to can­cel op­er­a­tions and turn pa­tients away.</p>
    <p>An­other was a Rus­sian “NotPetya” at­tack one month later, which forced US hos­pi­tals in ru­ral Vir­ginia and across Penn­syl­va­nia to turn away pa­tients whose records they could no longer access.</p>
    <p>It is not clear whether the cy­ber crim­i­nals in­tended to take Univer­sity Hospi­tal Dus­sel­dorf’s sys­tems hostage, or if the hospi­tal was col­lat­eral dam­age in an at­tack on a univer­sity.</p>
    <p>The ran­som note was ad­dressed to Hein­rich Heine Univer­sity, which is af­fil­i­ated with the hospi­tal, not to the hospi­tal it­self.</p>
    <p>Po­lice in Dus­sel­dorf con­tacted at­tack­ers via the ran­som note to ex­plain that it was the hospi­tal, not the univer­sity, that had been hit. At­tack­ers stopped the hack and turned over the en­cryp­tion key to un­lock the data.</p>
