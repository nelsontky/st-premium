    <p>Charges have not been levied against dozens of peo­ple ar­rested in Hong Kong two days ago, with most of them granted bail af­ter an overnight de­ten­tion, the city’s po­lice force yes­ter­day said.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said that so far, none of the 55 politi­cians and ac­tivists ar­rested in a na­tional se­cu­rity sweep on Wed­nes­day have been charged, de­spite be­ing told they had been hauled up for sub­vert­ing the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Only three were de­nied bail. They are for­mer De­mo­sisto leader Joshua Wong, vice-chair­man of lo­cal­ist group Peo­ple Power Tam</p>
    <p>Tak Chi, and for­mer Demo­cratic Party chair­man Wu Chi Wai.</p>
    <p>Wong is serv­ing time for or­gan­is­ing and in­cit­ing peo­ple to join the siege of Wan Chai po­lice head­quar­ters dur­ing the 2019 un­rest while Tam, who faces sedi­tion charges, is in pri­son await­ing trial in May.</p>
    <p>Wu is still in re­mand, with the court yes­ter­day re­vok­ing bail granted to him in an ear­lier case af­ter find­ing that he had failed to sur­ren­der his Bri­tish Na­tional Over­seas pass­port.</p>
    <p>He was pre­vi­ously or­dered by the court to sur­ren­der his travel doc­u­ments as part of bail terms set in an­other case in which he is ac­cused of in­cit­ing oth­ers to take part in a July 1 rally last year.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia re­ported that the other peo­ple ar­rested, re­leased on bail set at be­tween HK$30,000 and HK$50,000 (S$5,100 and S$8,500), are to re­port to the po­lice early next month. Their pass­ports have been im­pounded.</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s dawn raids led to 53 democ­racy ac­tivists – in­clud­ing Benny Tai, a con­victed leader of the 2014 Oc­cupy Cen­tral move­ment, for­mer law­mak­ers Au Nok Hin, He­lena Wong, Kwok Ka Ki and Jeremy Tam, district coun­cil­lors Lester Shum and Jimmy Sham, and Hong Kong-based Amer­i­can lawyer John Clancey – be­ing ar­rested. It was the big­gest such crack­down since China im­posed a se­cu­rity law on the city last year.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said the group planned to over­throw the gov­ern­ment by or­gan­is­ing or par­tic­i­pat­ing in a pri­mary elec­tion last July.</p>
    <p>The pri­mary elec­tion held by the pan-democrats saw some 600,000 res­i­dents turn­ing up to vote for their choice of rep­re­sen­ta­tives in Par­lia­ment or the Leg­isla­tive Council (LegCo).</p>
    <p>An elec­tion for the 70 LegCo seats was sup­posed to be held last Septem­ber but Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam post­poned it be­cause of the Covid-19 out­break. The elec­tion is now due in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam had pre­vi­ously warned that the pri­mary elec­tion could be breach­ing the se­cu­rity law that was en­acted for Hong Kong by Bei­jing in late June last year.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic Party, which has six for­mer law­mak­ers ar­rested in the po­lice op­er­a­tion, yes­ter­day called a con­fer­ence at which mem­bers in­clud­ing Lam Cheuk-ting and party chief Lo Kin-hei de­nounced the mass ar­rests as “ob­vi­ous po­lit­i­cal sup­pres­sion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lam, who called the ar­rests “a po­lit­i­cal de­ci­sion”, said of­fi­cers who held him could not pro­vide ev­i­dence such as the dates of the videos that showed his par­tic­i­pa­tion in last year’s pri­mary elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“I’m quite sure they may charge some of us... whether they have ev­i­dence or not. They want to cre­ate a chill­ing ef­fect. They want us to bow to the regime, say yes to any­thing re­gard­ing the Car­rie Lam ad­min­is­tra­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Sec­re­tary for Se­cu­rity John Lee and se­nior su­per­in­ten­dent Steve Li of the po­lice force’s na­tional se­cu­rity depart­ment said the op­po­si­tion’s plan was to paral­yse and over­throw the gov­ern­ment, thus breach­ing Ar­ti­cle 22 of the se­cu­rity law, which cov­ers at­tempts to sub­vert state power.</p>
    <p>They made the points, which have been echoed by some pro-Bei­jing law­mak­ers, that the un­of­fi­cial pri­mary elec­tion was part of the op­po­si­tion camp’s 35+ strat­egy and 10-step mu­tual dis­rup­tion plan.</p>
    <p>The move, mooted by Mr Tai, seeks to help the op­po­si­tion bloc win at least 35 seats in LegCo to en­able them to block gov­ern­ment bud­get and mount pres­sure for demo­cratic re­forms.</p>
    <p>Ar­ti­cle 52 of the Ba­sic Law, or the city’s mini Con­sti­tu­tion, says the chief ex­ec­u­tive must re­sign if he or she re­peat­edly fails to get a bud­get ap­proved by the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>This week’s mass ar­rests have drawn crit­i­cism from the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, with US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo threat­en­ing sanc­tions and the Euro­pean Union call­ing for the re­lease of those de­tained.</p>
    <p>But Bei­jing has de­fended the Hong Kong po­lice’s move, urg­ing crit­ics to im­me­di­ately stop in­ter­fer­ing in China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs.</p>
    <p>CHILL­ING EF­FECT</p>
    <p>I’m quite sure they may charge some of us sooner or later, whether they have ev­i­dence or not. They want to cre­ate a chill­ing ef­fect. They want us to bow to the regime, say yes to any­thing re­gard­ing the Car­rie Lam ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
