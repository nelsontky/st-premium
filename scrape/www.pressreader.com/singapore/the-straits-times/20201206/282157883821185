    <p>What I have ob­served is sim­ply that es­tab­lished schools tend to have more proac­tive alumni who can help busy school staff do the work of reach­ing out to other alumni they know, and per­haps have more ex­pe­ri­ence in co­or­di­nat­ing such pro­grammes. Hav­ing such a “twinned” alumni vol­un­teer­ing pool cre­ates economies of scale, as both schools can share re­sources.</p>
    <p>When I was 15, my batch­mates from CHIJ St Ni­cholas Girls’ School and I had the chance to sign up for tem­po­rary work stints that were on of­fer in var­i­ous or­gan­i­sa­tions from the hos­pi­tal­ity to lo­gis­tics sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing my week-long stint with a well-known real es­tate group, I got to tour the com­pany of­fice, work un­der a su­per­vi­sor on some ba­sic ad­min­is­tra­tive tasks, and net­work with staff from the hu­man re­source depart­ment over lunch in Clarke Quay – giv­ing me my first glimpse of life in the work­ing world.</p>
    <p>At the end of my first year of ju­nior col­lege at Hwa Chong In­sti­tu­tion (HCI), our teach­ers or­gan­ised a se­ries of ca­reer talks for us af­ter the ex­ams. Many were fronted by HCI alumni who had carved out their ca­reers in var­i­ous fields, from law to medicine to jour­nal­ism.</p>
    <p>In one talk I at­tended, an HCI alum­nus who had gone on to work at The New Pa­per spoke about what it was like to be a jour­nal­ist – a shar­ing that helped nudge me to­wards ap­ply­ing for an in­tern­ship at Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings that cul­mi­nated in me join­ing The Straits Times as a re­porter.</p>
    <p>With the re­cent re­lease of the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion re­sults, many pupils and par­ents in Sin­ga­pore would have pon­dered over which schools to ap­ply to next.</p>
    <p>Much has changed since I left school a decade ago, with more peo­ple now be­com­ing con­vinced that they should not be blindly chas­ing af­ter so-called “brand name” schools, or those that of­fer the In­te­grated Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry has also poured re­sources into en­sur­ing that every school has its niche strengths and that neigh­bour­hood schools, too, have state-of-the-art fa­cil­i­ties and tal­ented teach­ing staff.</p>
    <p>How­ever, one long­stand­ing is­sue re­mains: Older and more es­tab­lished schools are likely to have more in­volved alumni net­works that can pro­vide ca­reer ex­po­sure op­por­tu­ni­ties like in­tern­ships, talks or of­fice vis­its for their stu­dents – much like those that I went on when I was in school.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lished schools with longer his­to­ries – many dat­ing back to pre-in­de­pen­dence days – have a wider pool of in­volved and ac­tive alumni to tap. Many are af­fil­i­ated to clan or re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions, which nur­ture a stronger sense of iden­tity and com­mu­nity among those who have grad­u­ated.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, newer schools are less ex­pe­ri­enced in build­ing alumni net­works to help or­gan­ise such pro­grammes, which could be in­stru­men­tal in shap­ing one’s life path.</p>
    <p>It is pre­cisely to bridge the gap in ac­cess to ed­u­ca­tion and ca­reer and guid­ance op­por­tu­ni­ties across schools that non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Ac­cess Sin­ga­pore was started last year.</p>
    <p>As its founder Clarence Ching, 25, told me re­cently, es­tab­lished schools tend to have much stronger net­works and op­por­tu­ni­ties for stu­dents to learn about di­verse ca­reer path­ways from pre­vi­ous alumni.</p>
    <p>Less es­tab­lished schools, on the other hand, of­fer fewer of such op­por­tu­ni­ties for stu­dents. So stu­dents may not know what ca­reer op­tions ex­ist in the work­ing world, which may af­fect their so­cial mo­bil­ity, he added.</p>
    <p>Ac­cess Sin­ga­pore works with schools like North­brooks Sec­ondary, Naval Base Sec­ondary and Jurongvill­e Sec­ondary. It brings in com­pa­nies, such as lo­gis­tics provider Ninja Van, cy­ber se­cu­rity firm Kasper­sky Lab and con­sult­ing firm PwC, to pro­vide of­fice tours, ca­reer talks and other ca­reer-ex­po­sure pro­grammes for stu­dents.</p>
    <p>To be fair, es­tab­lished schools can hardly be faulted for nur­tur­ing strong alumni net­works and tap­ping them to broaden op­por­tu­ni­ties for their cur­rent stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, many of us have an emo­tional con­nec­tion to our for­mer schools, and would like to give back to or­gan­i­sa­tions that have shaped and moulded us. Schools also recog­nise the im­por­tance of de­vel­op­ing their stu­dents and want to go the ex­tra mile for them.</p>
    <p>But this will not lead to eq­ui­table out­comes if equally tal­ented stu­dents from other schools lose out on such op­por­tu­ni­ties that oth­ers have easy ac­cess to.</p>
    <p>Here is an idea to help bridge the gap and com­ple­ment the work that or­gan­i­sa­tions like Ac­cess do: have a more es­tab­lished school part­ner with an­other school in the vicin­ity, so that pro­grammes in­volv­ing alumni are open to both.</p>
    <p>Talks from alumni can then be held at both schools. Alumni from the older school can also share re­sources and best prac­tices to help the part­ner school build up its own net­work.</p>
    <p>In fact, my alma mater, HCI, has al­ready em­barked on part­ner­ships with other schools for some of its alumni pro­grammes. In 2018, stu­dents from Jurong West Sec­ondary School were in­vited to join HCI stu­dents to live on cam­pus at the HCI Board­ing School, where they also took part in net­work­ing ses­sions with prom­i­nent alumni. For ex­am­ple, stu­dents from both schools at­tended a di­a­logue and in­ter­acted with then Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Koh Poh Koon, an HCI alum­nus.</p>
    <p>Cyn­ics may say that alumni mem­bers wouldn’t want to vol­un­teer at a school they have no ties to.</p>
    <p>When I asked Ac­cess’ Mr Ching about this, he said this has hardly been his ex­pe­ri­ence, par­tic­u­larly for young work­ing pro­fes­sion­als. In fact, they are very open to vol­un­teer­ing in other schools other than their own when ap­proached.</p>
    <p>I can re­late to that. While I’ve given talks or helped at school events for my alma mater, I have also ac­cepted in­vi­ta­tions from per­sonal or pro­fes­sional con­tacts to con­duct sim­i­lar ca­reer talks in other schools and in­sti­tu­tions – and found the ex­pe­ri­ence in both set­tings equally re­ward­ing.</p>
    <p>What I have ob­served is sim­ply that es­tab­lished schools tend to have more proac­tive alumni who can help busy school staff do the work of reach­ing out to other alumni they know, and per­haps have more ex­pe­ri­ence in co­or­di­nat­ing such pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing such a “twinned” alumni vol­un­teer­ing pool cre­ates economies of scale, as both schools can share re­sources.</p>
    <p>It helps if the part­ner school is in the same neigh­bour­hood, as that gives alumni and stu­dents some com­mon shared ex­pe­ri­ences to build upon.</p>
    <p>With in­equal­ity world­wide driv­ing so­ci­eties apart, hav­ing such part­ner alumni net­works is just one small way to bridge gaps.</p>
