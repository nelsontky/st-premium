    <p>WHERE 02-166 Chi­na­town Com­plex Food Cen­tre, Block 335 Smith Street</p>
    <p>OPEN 5.30am to 8.30pm, closed on two Wed­nes­days a month</p>
    <p>Pre­pare to queue if you want to eat at this stall with 80 years of his­tory. The line starts as early as 6am, but it is fast-mov­ing. With at least four servers dol­ing out the dishes at any one time, ser­vice is brisk.</p>
    <p>The bee­hoon ($1) is any­thing but plain. Fried into short strands, the ver­mi­celli has a bouncy tex­ture and is sat­u­rated with smoky flavours of the wok.</p>
    <p>It is sim­ply fried with black soya sauce, salt and chicken pow­der, and a gen­er­ous toss of beansprout­s adds a fresh crisp to each bite.</p>
    <p>The fried mee costs $1. A yuan yang or­der of both bee­hoon and noo­dles will set you back $2.</p>
    <p>The fried items are all fac­tory-supplied but of good qual­ity. The ngoh hi­ang ($1), fish fil­let ($1) and lun­cheon meat (60 cents) are the most pop­u­lar items.</p>
    <p>Avoid the sunny-side-up, which is greasy and unim­pres­sive. But the tau kwa (60 cents), which seems like a bor­ing choice, is crisp on the out­side and ten­der on the in­side. En­joy it with the chilli and sweet sauce that is meant for dous­ing chee cheong fun.</p>
    <p>An in­ter­est­ing side dish here is the jel­ly­fish ($4 for small, $6 for medium), which comes with two limes, plenty of fresh co­rian­der and, when avail­able, Chi­nese cel­ery. A dash of light soya sauce and sesame oil lifts the dish. If you find it too bland, do not hes­i­tate to ask for more sea­son­ing.</p>
    <p>Also, do not miss out on the yam cake which is made in-house. The im­pos­si­bly smooth tex­ture of the yam cake looks fac­tory-pro­cessed, but the pow­dery tex­ture of yam is suf­fused with the aro­mas of dried prawn and fried shal­lot oil.</p>
    <p>It tastes of ded­i­ca­tion. In­deed, stall owner Yuen Meng Loi, 70, who took over the stall when her fa­ther died in 1981, says she has kept largely to his orig­i­nal yam cake recipe.</p>
