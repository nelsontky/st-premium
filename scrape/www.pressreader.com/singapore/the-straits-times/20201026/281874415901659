    <p>MI­AMI • A trop­i­cal de­pres­sion gained power south of Cuba to be­come Trop­i­cal Storm Zeta yes­ter­day as it trav­elled north into the Gulf of Mex­ico, where it is poised to be­come the record 11th storm to hit the US in a sin­gle year.</p>
    <p>The storm had winds of 65 kilo­me­tres per hour as it moved north­west about 400km south of Cuba’s western tip, the US Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre said.</p>
    <p>A turn to the north-west and in­crease in for­ward speed are ex­pected by to­day, it said.</p>
    <p>If it stays on track, it could brush the edge of the off­shore oil and nat­u­ral gas fields near Louisiana that have seen nu­mer­ous shut-ins this sea­son. Mr Eric Blake, a se­nior hur­ri­cane spe­cial­ist at the cen­tre, said Zeta could be­come a hur­ri­cane over the south-west Gulf of Mex­ico to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>So many storms have formed this year that the cen­tre ran out of of­fi­cial names and has started us­ing Greek let­ters to des­ig­nate sys­tems. The United States has been hard hit by hur­ri­canes Isa­ias, Laura, Hanna, Sally and Delta – all strik­ing the coast­line and caus­ing bil­lions of dol­lars in dam­age.</p>
    <p>While some storms, in­clud­ing Isa­ias and Fay, hit the East Coast, most struck the Gulf Coast between Texas and Florida. They in­cluded hur­ri­canes Laura and Delta, which came ashore near Cameron, Louisiana, send­ing res­i­dents a dou­ble dose of mis­ery.</p>
    <p>Zeta will prob­a­bly also strike Louisiana, mak­ing it the fifth storm to do so this year.</p>
    <p>A typ­i­cal At­lantic hur­ri­cane sea­son only spins up 12 storms, and only 2005 pro­duced more sys­tems than this year, with 28.</p>
    <p>The six-month sea­son the­o­ret­i­cally ends on Nov 30 but a num­ber of storms formed be­fore the sea­son’s of­fi­cial start date of June 1 this year, and some me­te­o­rol­o­gists think they could keep com­ing into De­cem­ber.</p>
