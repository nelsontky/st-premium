    <p>Wu Ching-feng and Waa Wei have been crowned best singers at Tai­wan’s Golden Melody Awards, as Malaysian singer Fish Leong failed to win the award for the sixth con­sec­u­tive time. The 31st edi­tion of the mu­sic awards, orig­i­nally sched­uled in June, was held in Taipei last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Wu, front­man of Tai­wanese band Soda­green, won Best Male Vo­cal­ist (Man­darin) for his al­bum Space­man, beat­ing big names Wakin Chau and Chang Chen-yue, as well as Malaysian rap­per Name­wee, Tai­wanese rap­per J.Sheon and Chi­nese singer Chiu.</p>
    <p>Wu, who was sued last year by his for­mer men­tor and record la­bel boss Will Lin due to a copy­right dis­pute, said emo­tion­ally dur­ing the ac­cep­tance speech: “I have to self­ishly say to my­self, ‘Thanks to my­self for not be­ing de­feated... thanks to my­self for still try­ing to sing. You have done your best. Thank you.’”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to mu­sic pro­ducer Isaac Chen, who was head of the judg­ing panel, Wu won the award in the first round of vot­ing.</p>
    <p>Wei, who was also the host of the cer­e­mony, won Best Fe­male Vo­cal­ist (Man­darin) for her al­bum Hid­den, Not For­got­ten, beat­ing Leong, Tai­wanese-Amer­i­can singer Joanna Wang, Hong Kong singer G.E.M., as well as Tai­wanese singers Peggy Hsu and Faith Yang.</p>
    <p>Weep­ing as she de­liv­ered her ac­cep­tance speech, Wei said: “This is my first Golden Melody Award and I hope there will be sec­ond and third ones.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Chen, Wei beat Wang by only one vote in the sec­ond round of vot­ing.</p>
    <p>Leong yes­ter­day posted on In­sta­gram a photo of her pre­pared speech, as she wrote: “The crib sheet in my hand. Still un­able to ful­fil a dream.”</p>
    <p>The big­gest win­ner this year was Tai­wanese abo­rig­i­nal singer Abao, who clinched Song of the Year for Thank You, as well as Al­bum of the Year and Best Indige­nous Lan­guage Al­bum for Mother Tongue.</p>
    <p>The Best Mu­si­cal Group went to Tai­wanese rock band Fire Ex for their al­bum Stand Up Like A Tai­wanese, while Best New Vo­cal went to singer Chih Siou for his al­bum The Ele­phant In The Room.</p>
    <p>Singers who per­formed in­cluded Leong, Wang, Sin­ga­pore’s JJ Lin and S.H.E’s Hebe Tien.</p>
