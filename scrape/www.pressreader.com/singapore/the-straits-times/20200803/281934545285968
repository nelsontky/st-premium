    </section>

    <p>The scale of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and the eco­nomic shut­downs it caused set in mo­tion a se­ries of de­bates and ques­tions about what the world may look like once its stran­gle­hold on so­ci­ety loosens: Will we travel less? Will we work at home more? Will norms in schools and at large-scale pub­lic events be changed for years?</p>
    <p>Less no­ticed, but just as im­por­tant, is the po­ten­tial that the coro­n­avirus could be a cat­a­lyst to over­haul the global eco­nomic or­der. A de­bate on the fail­ures of the global econ­omy had al­ready started be­fore the pan­demic, born of a sense that cap­i­tal­ism and cor­po­ra­tions had be­come par­a­sites on the planet.</p>
    <p>In the af­ter­math of the pan­demic, the world’s rich coun­tries should do more than just wait for cor­po­ra­tions to change. They have to over­haul their mon­e­tary poli­cies, the forms of pri­vate in­vest­ment they in­cen­tivise and the at­ti­tudes of their an­titrust en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­til now, mon­e­tary pol­icy has re­warded hold­ers of fi­nan­cial as­sets over those who have stock in real as­sets like land, fac­to­ries and labour. That’s be­cause the world’s most pow­er­ful cen­tral banks have pri­ori­tised con­trol­ling in­fla­tion over ex­pand­ing in­dus­trial ca­pac­ity and em­ploy­ment in what’s called the “real econ­omy”.</p>
    <p>This sta­tus quo in cen­tral bank­ing, which has been dom­i­nant for four decades, has en­cour­aged cor­po­ra­tions, es­pe­cially the largest pub­licly traded com­pa­nies, to fo­cus on short-term fi­nan­cial gains and share prices at the ex­pense of pur­su­ing longer-term in­vest­ments that would reap more broadly shared re­wards.</p>
    <p>Com­pound­ing the gains of those who al­ready own plenty of cap­i­tal has re­sulted in the en­trenched in­come in­equal­ity and stag­nant wages that cit­i­zens in dozens of coun­tries be­moan.</p>
    <p>In the United States, the Fed­eral Re­serve is ex­pected to op­er­ate un­der its dual man­date to pro­mote “max­i­mum em­ploy­ment” and sta­bilise prices (by lim­it­ing in­fla­tion). How­ever, while cen­tral banks like the Fed have ex­plicit in­fla­tion tar­gets – typ­i­cally aim­ing to keep the rate at 2 per cent – they do not have ex­plicit un­em­ploy­ment tar­gets.</p>
    <p>The Fed could in­stead put new poli­cies in place that make a very low un­em­ploy­ment rate – or more ag­gres­sively, un­der­em­ploy­ment rate – the new trig­ger for whether it de­cides to stim­u­late or hit the fi­nan­cial brakes on the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This shift would avert the risk of de­press­ing wages and be help­ful to groups in the work­force who are dis­crim­i­nated against and of­ten “first fired, last hired”. And cru­cially, it would re­ward com­pa­nies for longer-term in­vest­ments that pro­mote real eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>How else can the fi­nan­cial mar­kets be en­cour­aged to pri­ori­tise real, pro­duc­tive in­vest­ment? Gov­ern­ments can be­gin to is­sue higher taxes on div­i­dend pay­ments to large share­hold­ers of big, pub­licly traded com­pa­nies and pair that with tax re­duc­tions on long-term in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>It’s not sur­pris­ing that in­vestors – who for years looked at a land­scape of slug­gish-to-mod­er­ate global growth – have been look­ing for quick fi­nan­cial re­turns rather than pro­duc­tive, but some­times risky, long-term in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Guided by share­holder de­mands, for the past decade, busi­nesses have fo­cused on de­liv­er­ing re­turns quickly and pre­dictably to in­vestors in­stead of in­vest­ing in longer-hori­zon in­fra­struc­tures – like re­search, plants and ma­chin­ery that would ul­ti­mately lead to in­no­va­tion and drive eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a 2019 re­port, Amer­i­can In­vest­ment in the 21st Cen­tury led by Se­na­tor Marco Ru­bio of Florida, net pri­vate do­mes­tic in­vest­ment in fixed as­sets like equip­ment, ma­chin­ery and prop­erty has shrunk in half since the mid-1980s.</p>
    <p>Higher taxes on large div­i­dend pay­ments and fed­eral sub­si­dies for long-term in­vest­ments could help Amer­ica re­verse course.</p>
    <p>We also need to ad­dress con­cen­tra­tion of cor­po­rate power. To over­haul the pre­vail­ing global eco­nomic ar­chi­tec­ture, the globe’s lead­ing gov­ern­ments will need to ad­dress the fact that many sec­tors – air­lines, bank­ing, tech­nol­ogy – have be­come oli­gop­ol­ies dom­i­nated by just a few multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions. Th­ese Gilded Age style mar­kets re­duce com­pe­ti­tion and con­cen­trate the pric­ing power of large, well-con­nected cor­po­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>There have been calls to break up tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies or to limit their scale and mo­nop­o­lis­tic ten­den­cies. How­ever, dozens of na­tional reg­u­la­tors are pit­ted against global cor­po­ra­tions that can use their mul­ti­ple bases to evade rules in­con­ve­nient to them. So in­ter­na­tional reg­u­la­tory co­op­er­a­tion will be needed to rein in the in­creas­ingly un­fet­tered power of th­ese multi­na­tional be­he­moths.</p>
    <p>At a time when many gov­ern­ments seem steered by na­tion­al­ism, ef­fec­tive cross-bor­der co­op­er­a­tion is hard to imag­ine. How­ever, feats of global co­op­er­a­tion from the past – like the post-World War II es­tab­lish­ment of the Bret­ton Woods sys­tem’s new world or­der – of­fer ex­am­ples of lead­ers even­tu­ally meet­ing the mo­ment even amid for­mi­da­ble chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is not just giv­ing us a chance to re­think how to best live and work. It is also pro­vid­ing an op­por­tu­nity to re­con­sider the way that the very struc­tures of our world econ­omy op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>The world’s rich coun­tries should do more than just wait for cor­po­ra­tions to change. They have to over­haul their mon­e­tary poli­cies, the forms of pri­vate in­vest­ment they in­cen­tivise and the at­ti­tudes of their an­titrust en­force­ment.</p>
