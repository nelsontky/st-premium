    <p>•</p>
    <p>MADRID Real Madrid coach Zine­dine Zidane has said he is not con­tem­plat­ing los­ing his job if his side fail to progress from the Cham­pi­ons League group stage.</p>
    <p>The 13-time Euro­pean cham­pi­ons, who have never failed to make it to the last 16, host Group B lead­ers Borus­sia Monchengla­d­bach to­day in the fi­nal group game need­ing a win at the Al­fredo di Ste­fano Sta­dium to make sure of progress.</p>
    <p>Any­thing less could open the trap door de­pend­ing on Shakhtar Donetsk’s re­sult at In­ter Mi­lan.</p>
    <p>Monchengla­d­bach are ahead by a point on eight with Shakhtar above Real – both are on seven points – on the ba­sis of a su­pe­rior head-to-head record. In­ter, with five points, are also still in the run­ning.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia re­ports have sug­gested Zidane will be sacked should the Span­ish cham­pi­ons drop into the Europa League for the first time since the 1994-95 sea­son.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the French­man in­sisted his only fo­cus is on get­ting the vic­tory, rather than his fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“The club will do what they have to do (in the event of not qual­i­fy­ing), as they al­ways do, but I’m only think­ing about the game,” Zidane said at his vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day. “I’m not think­ing about any­thing else other than win­ning. I’m fo­cused on to­mor­row’s game and we know what we have to do. It’ll be tough, but we need to be able to walk off the pitch sat­is­fied with our work.</p>
    <p>“We know there’s an­other game go­ing on but we’re only think­ing about our game. We know ex­actly what the sit­u­a­tion is. We want to get the three points and fin­ish top of the group; that’s what we’re all think­ing about. All matches are im­por­tant but this is a great chance to show what we are as a team.”</p>
    <p>On whether he would hold any grudges should he get booted out de­spite 11 tro­phies, in­clud­ing three straight Cham­pi­ons League ti­tles with Real, Zidane said: “What hap­pened in the past is in the past. To­mor­row is a game to show what we can do. I’m sure we’ll have a great game to­mor­row.”</p>
    <p>Zidane will be boosted by the re­turn of cap­tain Ser­gio Ramos after a six-game ab­sence and de­fender Dani Car­va­jal fol­low­ing a fourgame spell on the side­lines.</p>
    <p>While the pres­sure is on Real,</p>
    <p>Glad­bach coach Marco Rose is wary of a back­lash from the hosts, who have been stung by crit­i­cism of their patchy form.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man Bun­desliga out­fit have never gone past the group stage of the Cham­pi­ons League – they last reached the Euro­pean Cup knock­out stage in 1978 – yet they only re­quire a draw to book their slot. But play­ing for a point is “never a wise de­ci­sion”, ad­mit­ted Rose.</p>
    <p>“Such teams func­tion best un­der pres­sure,” he said yes­ter­day. “We also saw that against In­ter Mi­lan (Real won both legs). We know what to ex­pect and that we will need to de­fend re­ally hard and with pas­sion.”</p>
    <p>In Group A, Atletico Madrid travel to Aus­tria know­ing they need to avoid de­feat at Red Bull Salzburg to ad­vance as run­ners-up be­hind Euro­pean cham­pi­ons Bay­ern Mu­nich.</p>
