    <p>LON­DON • The num­ber of Bri­tish re­tail­ers fight­ing for sur­vival has jumped by about a quar­ter this year.</p>
    <p>Al­most 40,000 com­pa­nies – selling both on­line and in stores – are cur­rently in “sig­nif­i­cant fi­nan­cial dis­tress”, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey by in­sol­vency firm Beg­bies Traynor Group.</p>
    <p>The fig­ure has risen 24 per cent from this time last year as re­tail­ers grap­ple with the es­ca­lat­ing im­pact of Covid-19. It has climbed 11 per cent since just Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“This has been one of the tough­est years ever” for re­tail­ers, said Ms Julie Palmer, a part­ner at Beg­bies Traynor, in an e-mail state­ment. “While many i ndus­tries have been hit hard, re­tail – which was al­ready suf­fer­ing a cri­sis of con­fi­dence – has been shaken to its foun­da­tions.”</p>
    <p>Shops in Bri­tain had only re­cently re­opened from a lock­down when the gov­ern­ment or­dered non-es­sen­tial stores in south-east Eng­land to shut again on Sun­day, in a bid to stem a more in­fec­tious mu­ta­tion of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>En­forced clo­sures in the run-up to Christ­mas – and less than two weeks be­fore the end of the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod – could prove fa­tal for some com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>This year has al­ready seen the col­lapse of a num­ber of chains, no­tably depart­ment store op­er­a­tor Deben­hams and Sir Philip Green’s Ar­ca­dia Group. Between them, they em­ploy over 20,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Both had been strug­gling for some time, weighed down by costly stores as they tried to com­pete with on­line up­starts. Covid-19 only ac­cel­er­ated their demise.</p>
    <p>Ms He­len Dick­in­son, chief ex­ec­u­tive of in­dus­try trade body Bri­tish Re­tail Con­sor­tium, said: “Faced with the prospect of los­ing £2 bil­lion (S$3.6 bil­lion) per week in sales for the third time this year, many busi­nesses will be in se­ri­ous dif­fi­culty and many thou­sands of jobs could be at risk.”</p>
    <p>Even those that seemed to be far­ing bet­ter are tak­ing a hit.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Mike Ash­ley’s Frasers Group, which owns the Sports Di­rect brand and is in ne­go­ti­a­tions to save part of the Deben­hams busi­ness, with­drew a profit fore­cast made only 10 days ear­lier.</p>
    <p>It said it could no longer com­mit to a pre­dic­tion for profit to in­crease 20 per cent to 30 per cent this year, given a shut­down of many stores dur­ing “peak trad­ing and the high like­li­hood of fur­ther rolling lock­downs na­tion­wide over the fol­low­ing months”.</p>
    <p>Shares of Frasers fell more than 10 per cent on Mon­day, con­tribut­ing to a broader sell-off among fash­ion re­tail stocks.</p>
    <p>Re­tail­ers are call­ing for fresh fi­nan­cial sup­port from the gov­ern­ment to help them weather a cri­sis made worse by the cur­rent chaos at Bri­tish ports – which fol­lowed the de­ci­sion by a num­ber of Euro­pean Union coun­tries to tem­po­rar­ily close their bor­ders with Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Mr Ju­lian Dunker­ton, CEO of ap­parel brand Su­perdry, said Bri­tain’s town cen­tres face a “bleak” fu­ture with­out help. “The gov­ern­ment needs to act ur­gently,” he said, call­ing for a re­duc­tion in the value-added tax shop­pers pay on cer­tain goods, among other mea­sures.</p>
