    <p>Re­united with three-time Sin­ga­pore cham­pion jockey Vlad Duric, Top Knight scored a de­serv­ing vic­tory in the $500,000 Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Derby, resched­uled from April 18 to yes­ter­day due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and run be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>The Michael Clements-trained and Fal­con Rac­ing No. 7 Stable­owned seven-time win­ner over­came the sec­ond-widest bar­rier, No. 13, and the yield­ing track to thun­der home from last to repli­cate last year’s Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Guineas fin­ish.</p>
    <p>He got up in the nick of time to win by a neck from the Cliff Brown­trained $453 out­sider Elite In­cred­i­ble, the horse he beat in the fi­nal leg of the Sin­ga­pore Three-YearOld Chal­lenge in May last year.</p>
    <p>Top Knight, the last leg of Duric’s five-timer, started as the $15 sec­ond favourite, be­hind his last-start $1 mil­lion Group 1 Kranji Mile con­queror Ara­maayo ($13), who fin­ished fifth.</p>
    <p>The Lee Freed­man-trained hat­trick win­ner Min­is­ter held on for third, two lengths away.</p>
    <p>Top Knight gar­nered five sec­onds from his last six starts, which in­cluded the Group 3 Sil­ver Bowl over 1,400m in Fe­bru­ary, Group 2 Stew­ards’ Cup over 1,600m in March and the Kranji Mile last start.</p>
    <p>Duric had been Top Knight’s reg­u­lar rider from the be­gin­ning of last year but reign­ing cham­pion ap­pren­tice Si­mon Kok rode the horse in the last two starts.</p>
    <p>The Derby field left cleanly, ex­cept for Quad­copter. Duric neatly parked Top Knight in the rear of the 1,800m fea­ture. He be­came last when Quad­copter made up ground to over­take him.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter led from the start, but Elite In­cred­i­ble poked ahead with 300m left. Re­spond­ing to Duric’s vig­or­ous rid­ing, Top Knight inched closer and closer.</p>
    <p>For a mo­ment, it looked like his ef­fort would be in vain. But Top Knight showed what class was all about and claimed his eighth suc­cess in 17 starts, tak­ing his prize money to about $1.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>When Top Knight pro­duced his char­ac­ter­is­tic fin­ish yes­ter­day, Clements thought the Derby was his. But he be­came a lit­tle wor­ried when Elite In­cred­i­ble proved stub­born at the fin­ish.</p>
    <p>“At the 200m mark, I thought we could win the race. But, as we got closer to the fin­ish­ing line, the sec­ond horse kept find­ing more. At some stage, we thought we were never go­ing to get there,” said the Zim­babwe-born trainer.</p>
    <p>“But, for­tu­nately, Top Knight is a gen­uine fighter.”</p>
    <p>He was more con­cerned about the wet track than the wide draw but Top Knight han­dled it well.</p>
    <p>“We had the winkers on for the horse today and he seemed to be trav­el­ling a lot bet­ter ear­lier on. He was not get­ting so far back, so I was quite happy with the po­si­tion he held in the run­ning,” he said.</p>
    <p>“He turned for home with his usual strong run on the out­side.”</p>
    <p>Clements feels the 1,800m could be his cham­pion’s op­ti­mum dis­tance but the $1 mil­lion Sin­ga­pore Gold Cup over 2,000m is still on the agenda. “The Gold Cup trip is a ques­tion mark. But, any­way, we’ve got some time to work things out,” he said.</p>
