    <p>SYD­NEY Twit­ter has re­buffed Aus­tralian calls to re­move a Bei­jing of­fi­cial’s in­cen­di­ary tweet tar­get­ing Aus­tralian troops, as China dou­bled down on crit­i­cism in the face of mount­ing in­ter­na­tional con­dem­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian sparked out­rage in Can­berra on Mon­day when he posted a staged im­age of an Aus­tralian sol­dier hold­ing a bloody knife to an Afghan child’s throat. The child is seen hold­ing a lamb.</p>
    <p>The post came just days af­ter Aus­tralian prose­cu­tors launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into 19 mem­bers of the coun­try’s mil­i­tary over al­leged war crimes com­mit­ted in Afghanista­n be­tween 2005 and 2016.</p>
    <p>A Twit­ter spokesman con­firmed that the so­cial me­dia com­pany had marked the im­age con­tained within the tweet as sen­si­tive me­dia.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son had called the tweet “re­pug­nant”, hold­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence from quar­an­tine to de­mand Twit­ter take it down and China apol­o­gise.</p>
    <p>He said Bei­jing should be “to­tally ashamed” of the “out­ra­geous and dis­gust­ing slur” against the Aus­tralian armed forces.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter is banned for most cit­i­zens in China and Bei­jing has for decades been ac­cused of wide­spread hu­man rights abuses.</p>
    <p>Some Aus­tralian al­lies ex­pressed con­cern over the tweet, in­clud­ing New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern.</p>
    <p>“In this case, an im­age has been used that is not fac­tu­ally cor­rect, that is not a gen­uine im­age, so we have raised that di­rectly with the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties,” she told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The French for­eign af­fairs min­istry said the post was “un­wor­thy of the diplo­matic stan­dards we have the right to ex­pect from a coun­try like China”.</p>
    <p>A spokesman said the im­age was “in­sult­ing for all the coun­tries whose armed forces have been en­gaged in Afghanista­n for the last 20 years”.</p>
    <p>In a re­strained state­ment, Kabul said it was “jointly work­ing” with Can­berra to in­ves­ti­gate the al­leged mis­con­duct of Aus­tralian troops, adding that both Aus­tralia and China were “key play­ers” in main­tain­ing in­ter­na­tional con­sen­sus on peace and de­vel­op­ment in Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>There was fur­ther em­bar­rass­ment for Aus­tralia yes­ter­day when The Guardian news web­site pub­lished an im­age pur­port­ing to show an Aus­tralian sol­dier chug­ging beer from a dead Tale­ban fighter’s pros­thetic leg.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Chi­nese em­bassy in Can­berra ac­cused Aus­tralia of mak­ing too much of Mr Zhao’s tweet.</p>
    <p>“The rage and roar of some Aus­tralian politi­cians and me­dia is noth­ing but mis­read­ing of and over­re­ac­tion to Mr Zhao’s tweet,” the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The em­bassy also sug­gested that Aus­tralian of­fi­cials were at­tempt­ing to “de­flect pub­lic at­ten­tion from the hor­ri­ble atroc­i­ties by cer­tain Aus­tralian sol­diers” and “stoke do­mes­tic na­tion­al­ism”.</p>
    <p>The diplo­matic row has sent re­la­tions be­tween Bei­jing and Can­berra plung­ing to a new low.</p>
    <p>China has im­posed a se­ries of eco­nomic sanc­tions on Aus­tralian goods in re­cent months, while state-con­trolled news out­lets have re­peat­edly at­tacked Aus­tralia over a range of is­sues.</p>
    <p>It comes af­ter Can­berra be­gan push­ing back on Bei­jing’s grow­ing power in the re­gion, cracked down on Chi­nese in­flu­ence op­er­a­tions Down Un­der and called for an in­de­pen­dent in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
