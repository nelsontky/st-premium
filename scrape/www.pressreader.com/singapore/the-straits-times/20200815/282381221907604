    <p>• Six-time For­mula One world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton has shrugged off a plan to re­strict cars’ en­gine modes in qual­i­fy­ing, claim­ing that it will have lit­tle im­pact on slow­ing his dom­i­nant Mercedes team.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Au­to­mo­bile Fed­er­a­tion (FIA) con­firmed ahead of to­mor­row’s Span­ish Grand Prix that the 10 teams had been in­formed a change was be­ing eval­u­ated.</p>
    <p>A tech­ni­cal di­rec­tive could take ef­fect at the Bel­gian Grand Prix on Aug 30.</p>
    <p>The change would re­quire teams to use the same en­gine modes in qual­i­fy­ing as in the race, where power is typ­i­cally turned up to the max­i­mum only in short bursts to pre­serve en­gine life­span and re­li­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mercedes, win­ners of the past six driv­ers’ and con­struc­tors’ ti­tles, have started all five races this sea­son from pole po­si­tion, and Hamil­ton is view­ing this new pro­posal as the latest at­tempt to rein their speed in.</p>
    <p>“It’s not a sur­prise. They’re al­ways try­ing to slow us down,” the 35-year-old Bri­ton, who has a 30-point lead in the cham­pi­onship stand­ings over Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen (77), told re­porters at Barcelona’s Cir­cuit de Catalunya.</p>
    <p>“But it doesn’t re­ally change a huge amount for us, so it’s not a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“The guys at our team have just done such a great job with the en­gine.</p>
    <p>“It’s ob­vi­ously to slow us down but I don’t think it’s go­ing to get the re­sult that they want. But that’s to­tally fine if they do.”</p>
    <p>His Fin­nish team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas added that the Sil­ver Ar­rows were not pan­ick­ing, warn­ing that a change across the board might not be good for rac­ing.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery team ob­vi­ously they have dif­fer­ent modes, how much they want to risk in terms of wear­ing (down) the en­gine,” he said. “Also in terms of strate­gic things... many times we’re us­ing dif­fer­ent kind of modes whether we are de­fend­ing, at­tack­ing.</p>
    <p>“From my side, it feels like if it would be the same en­gine mode for ev­ery­one all through the race, there could be less over­tak­ing be­cause ev­ery­one is just run­ning the same modes in­stead of play­ing with them.”</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton, who has won three of the five grands prix this year and is just four wins from equalling Michael Schu­macher’s record of 91, was just 0.039 sec be­hind Bot­tas (1min 16.785sec) in a Mercedes one-two in the first prac­tice ses­sion yes­ter­day.</p>
