    <p>IN­GRE­DI­ENTS</p>
    <p>1 to 1.2kg seafood (I used salmon, white­bait, squid and prawns), weighed af­ter trim­ming and re­mov­ing shells</p>
    <p>250g onions (about two medium)</p>
    <p>50g laksa leaves on the stems</p>
    <p>800g to 1kg Rus­set pota­toes</p>
    <p>2 tsp salt</p>
    <p>100g salted but­ter</p>
    <p>200g shred­ded cheese, di­vided</p>
    <p>(I used a mix of ched­dar and moz­zarella)</p>
    <p>2 Tbs cook­ing oil, plus 1 tsp for greas­ing</p>
    <p>200g store-bought laksa paste</p>
    <p>125ml wa­ter or prawn stock</p>
    <p>(see step 1)</p>
    <p>100ml co­conut milk</p>
    <p>80g panko crumbs</p>
    <p>METHOD</p>
    <p>1. If us­ing shell-on prawns, save the heads and shells and make a quick stock for the pie. Rinse the shells un­der run­ning wa­ter and drain well. Place in a medium saucepan with 250ml wa­ter and bring to a boil. Con­tinue boil­ing un­til stock is</p>
    <p>re­duced by half, to 125ml. This will take eight to 10 min­utes over medium high heat. Strain the stock and set it aside. Dis­card the heads and shells. 2. Cut the fish into thick chunks. If us­ing salmon, pull out the pin bones first, and leave the skin on so the pieces keep their shape. Devein the prawns, if us­ing. Rinse the squid out un­der run­ning wa­ter and pull out its head and trans­par­ent car­ti­lage.</p>
    <p>Cut it into rings. Dis­card the car­ti­lage. Cut off the eyes and head, but re­serve the ten­ta­cles.</p>
    <p>If us­ing white­bait, rinse un­der run­ning wa­ter and drain.</p>
    <p>3. Chop the onions finely and set aside. Pick the leaves off the laksa leaf stems. Dis­card brown and with­ered leaves and the stems.</p>
    <p>Give the leaves a quick rinse un­der run­ning wa­ter and pat dry with paper tow­els. Chop them finely.</p>
    <p>4. Scrub the pota­toes. Place them in a saucepan with the salt, bring to a boil and cook un­til a knife pierces through the pota­toes eas­ily. Peel the pota­toes, cut into rough chunks and put them in a large mix­ing bowl. Add the but­ter and 100g of the shred­ded cheese. Mash un­til smooth. Have a taste and add salt if you need to. Cover the mashed pota­toes and set aside.</p>
    <p>5. Spoon the cook­ing oil into a large fry­ing pan or wok set over medium heat. When it is hot, add the onions and cook them for two to three min­utes, un­til translucen­t. Turn the heat to medium low. Add the laksa paste and fry for four to five min­utes. Add the 125ml of wa­ter or prawn stock, stir to mix, turn the heat up to medium high and bring to a boil. Pour in the co­conut milk and stir to mix.</p>
    <p>Add the seafood. If us­ing salmon, that should go in first, fol­lowed by the prawns and other seafood.</p>
    <p>Squid should al­ways go in last to pre­vent it from over­cook­ing.</p>
    <p>6. When all the seafood have turned opaque, turn off the heat. Add the chopped laksa leaves and stir them through the seafood.</p>
    <p>7. Pre­heat the oven to 200 deg C and place the metal rack in the mid­dle of it. Line a bak­ing tray that is larger than the bak­ing dish with foil. This is to catch drips if they hap­pen.</p>
    <p>8. Lightly oil a deep, oven­proof bak­ing dish. The one I use mea­sures 32cm by20cm. Scat­ter the panko crumbs at the bot­tom. Spoon the seafood into the bak­ing dish, us­ing the back of a spoon to even out the layer. Spoon the mashed potato over the seafood, smooth out with the back of a clean spoon. Scat­ter over the re­main­ing cheese.</p>
    <p>9. Place the bak­ing dish on the lined bak­ing tray. Bake for 15 to 20 min­utes or un­til the top of the pie is bub­bly and golden brown. Let it rest 10 min­utes and serve.</p>
    <p>Serves six</p>
