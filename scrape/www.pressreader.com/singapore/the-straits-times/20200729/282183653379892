    <p>HONG KONG • Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and some other na­tions are ready­ing in­cen­tives to at­tract banks and as­set man­agers in Hong Kong that are wor­ried about the new se­cu­rity law im­posed by China, but fi­nance sec­tor ex­perts say even if they move, it will be to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>High taxes and costs, bloated bu­reau­cra­cies and cul­tural dif­fer­ences in some of th­ese Asia-Pa­cific na­tions present formidable chal­lenges for the Hong Kong fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to re­lo­cate even par­tially, while Sin­ga­pore’s sim­i­lar­i­ties to Hong Kong give it an ad­van­tage, they say, though the South-east Asian city-state has not ac­tively been seek­ing such busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing im­posed a tough na­tional se­cu­rity law from July 1 on Hong Kong, re­gional home to many global fi­nan­cial groups, prompt­ing com­pa­nies to re­assess their oper­a­tions there.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tors said last week they had been ap­proached by in­sti­tu­tions con­cerned about the law, but they said it would not af­fect oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, re­gional ri­vals hope to ben­e­fit from the con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“The po­lit­i­cal up­heaval in Hong Kong has cre­ated an op­por­tu­nity for Aus­tralia and Syd­ney to be­come a stronger re­gional fi­nan­cial cen­tre,” Se­na­tor An­drew Bragg wrote to Aus­tralia’s Trea­surer this month, propos­ing pol­icy changes.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan in­cluded at­tract­ing “ex­cel­lent hu­man re­sources” to form a global fi­nan­cial cen­tre in an eco­nomic pol­icy roadmap ear­lier this month, fol­low­ing of­fi­cial re­marks they could win busi­ness from Hong Kong. Draft pro­pos­als from the rul­ing party in­clude visa sup­port and stream­lin­ing ap­provals for in­vest­ment man­age­ment li­cences.</p>
    <p>Smaller fi­nan­cial cen­tres are also try­ing their luck.</p>
    <p>Bu­san in South Korea is of­fer­ing tax breaks and rent-free of­fices to fi­nan­cial firms, while Tai­wan’s top reg­u­la­tor told Reuters he hoped the is­land’s rule of law and demo­cratic val­ues would at­tract busi­ness.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the mooted re­forms do not move the dial enough, say some pro­fes­sion­als in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Tokyo will, frankly, strug­gle to steal sig­nif­i­cant mar­ket share from, let alone re­place, Hong Kong,” said Mr Steven Tran, a part­ner at law firm Mayer Brown in Hong Kong, who was pre­vi­ously based in Tokyo for four years.</p>
    <p>Mr Tran said Ja­panese taxes, to­gether with a per­ceived greater level of bu­reau­cracy, higher labour costs and less English lan­guage flu­ency, would make it harder for fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to op­er­ate re­gional hubs from Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s cor­po­rate tax rate of 16.5 per cent is a lit­tle over half that of Ja­pan and Aus­tralia’s, and among the low­est in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Con­vinc­ing se­nior staff to give up an in­ter­na­tional life­style in Hong Kong is an­other chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>“Typ­i­cally, when ex­pa­tri­ates move to Ja­pan they need much more hand-holding than when mov­ing to Hong Kong,” said Toky­obased busi­ness devel­op­ment man­ager Jeremy Laugh­lin at Santa Fe Re­lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Lan­guage and cul­tural dif­fi­cul­ties as well as the ab­sence of ad­e­quate fi­nan­cial in­fras­truc­ture could scup­per South Korea and Tai­wan’s ef­forts too.</p>
    <p>Cul­tural is­sues are less dif­fi­cult for Aus­tralia, but Fi­nan­cial Services Coun­cil chief ex­ec­u­tive Sally Loane said Aus­tralia needed to im­ple­ment greater tax re­form and make reg­u­la­tory changes to align its fund man­age­ment in­dus­try with other Asian ju­ris­dic­tions to at­tract Hong Kong busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Firms have not made any ma­jor moves from Hong Kong as yet, but they are be­ing cir­cum­spect even about dis­cussing con­tin­gency plans as the topic is sen­si­tive and many hope to ex­pand in main­land China.</p>
    <p>Lawyers and ad­vis­ers say Sin­ga­pore is the most likely ben­e­fi­ciary of any re­lo­ca­tion, thanks to its cor­po­rate tax rate of 17 per cent, a busi­ness friendly en­vi­ron­ment, and its stand­ing as a fi­nan­cial cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one is com­pet­ing for tal­ent but in terms of pop­u­la­tion, eco­nomic pro­file, and ease of do­ing busi­ness, Sin­ga­pore is the most sim­i­lar to Hong Kong,” said Sin­ga­pore­based an­a­lyst Ja­son Salim at risk con­sul­tancy Con­trol Risks.</p>
