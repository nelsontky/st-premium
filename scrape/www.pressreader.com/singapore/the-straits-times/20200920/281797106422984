    <p>De­spite a l an­guage bar­rier and health chal­lenges, 81-year-old Lim Ee Chin came for­ward to help her next-door neigh­bour Aisyah Vil­le­gas when a fire broke out in the liv­ing room of her flat.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim im­me­di­ately sprang into ac­tion when she saw black smoke bil­low­ing out of Ms Aisyah’s front door.</p>
    <p>She filled a pail with wa­ter in her bath­room, dragged it across her liv­ing room floor to her front gate and passed it to Ms Aisyah’s brother, who had fran­ti­cally dashed out of the flat to seek help.</p>
    <p>It was not an easy feat for Madam Lim, who has a curved spine and heart is­sues, but this did not bother her in that in­stant.</p>
    <p>“Of course I had to help. When I saw their house burn­ing, it hurt my heart. They didn’t set the fire on pur­pose. What if they have no house to live in?” she said i n Man­darin, when The Sun­day Times vis­ited her on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>For her brav­ery, she re­ceived the Com­mu­nity First Re­spon­der Award on Aug 27, which was given out by the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force.</p>
    <p>She is the old­est re­cip­i­ent of the award, which is pre­sented to mem­bers of the pub­lic who have stepped for­ward to ren­der as­sis­tance to oth­ers in dis­tress, to save prop­erty, or both.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim said she could not re­call how many pails of wa­ter she fetched that night on Aug 9, but “it felt like an hour that would never end”.</p>
    <p>She had been watch­ing tele­vi­sion in the liv­ing room of her 12th­storey flat in Block 917, Jurong West Street 91, when she saw the smoke and heard her neigh­bour’s cry for help.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim’s swift ac­tions that night left an im­pres­sion on Ms Aisyah, 27, who said that apart from the usual neigh­bourly greet­ings, she had not in­ter­acted much with the older woman be­fore the fire be­cause of the lan­guage bar­rier be­tween them.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim has lived in the flat for around 10 years, while Ms Aisyah moved i nto hers three</p>
    <p>KIND PER­SON</p>
    <p>years ago.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim, who did not have any for­mal ed­u­ca­tion, speaks mainly Man­darin and Chi­nese di­alects, with a smat­ter­ing of self</p>
    <p>taught English and Malay.</p>
    <p>Ms Aisyah, who lives in the cor­ner unit with her hus­band, two step­sons and her brother, said of Madam Lim: “She’s al­ready so old but she still came out to help us so I was very sur­prised, though she has al­ways been very kind to us.”</p>
    <p>Ms Aisyah, who works as a re­tail as­sis­tant, said the fire ap­peared to have been caused by an elec­tri­cal fault, although the ex­act cause is un­clear.</p>
    <p>She plans to buy some face masks for her Good Sa­mar­i­tan neigh­bour as thank-you gifts.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim, who re­tired in 2018 af­ter work­ing in a tin fac­tory for 36 years, spends most of her time now at home, go­ing out mainly to buy food and for doc­tor vis­its.</p>
    <p>Her 68-year-old sis­ter, who lives with her in the flat and wanted to be known only as Madam Loh, en­cour</p>
    <p>ages her to go out more of­ten.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim was adopted by Madam Loh’s mother at a young age but did not change her sur­name.</p>
    <p>The two women have never mar­ried. They have a brother and sis­ter.</p>
    <p>Madam Loh, who does ad­min­is­tra­tive work in an au­dit firm, said of Madam Lim: “My sis­ter was not ed­u­cated at all but she’s re­ally in­tel­li­gent and her mem­ory is very good – it’s even bet­ter than mine.”</p>
    <p>Madam Lim said she feels over­whelmed by all the me­dia at­ten­tion from the award and she does not see her ac­tions as “any­thing spe­cial”.</p>
    <p>“It’s just what neigh­bours do for each other, there’s no need to make a big fuss over it.”</p>
    <p>She’s al­ready so old but she still came out to help us so I was very sur­prised, though she has al­ways been very kind to us.</p>
