    <p>A large tree log sits next to the waters of the Sin­ga­pore Strait be­tween Labrador Na­ture Re­serve and Sen­tosa Is­land.</p>
    <p>On this “love log”, as pro­lific Sin­ga­porean match­maker Anisa Has­san calls it, her high-net-worth clients pour their hearts out to her amid na­ture and the gen­tle lap­ping of waves against the shore.</p>
    <p>The neigh­bour­hood is also home to Ma­rina at Kep­pel Bay, where some of her clients’ yachts are parked, as well as lux­ury condominiu­m Re­flec­tions at Kep­pel Bay.</p>
    <p>But deep pock­ets or not, when it comes to mat­ters of the heart, emo­tions are uni­ver­sal.</p>
    <p>“Many tears have been spilt here,” says Ms Anisa, the founder of lux­ury match­mak­ing ser­vice Date High Fly­ers (DHF).</p>
    <p>Thanks to her, more than 1,000 cou­ples have got mar­ried in her 16 years in the match­mak­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The for­mer jour­nal­ist, who is in her 40s and has been mar­ried for 22 years, with two kids aged 16 and 19, is an early mover in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>She ran the Sin­ga­pore fran­chise of Amer­i­can dat­ing plat­form It’s Just Lunch from 2004 to 2017, which fo­cuses on set­ting up first dates.</p>
    <p>“All we had at the time was the Govern­ment’s SDU (So­cial De­vel­op­ment Unit), which en­cour­aged mar­riage among grad­u­ates,” she says.</p>
    <p>SDU is now known as the So­cial De­vel­op­ment Net­work.</p>
    <p>She adds: “But some­thing like It’s Just Lunch worked for busy pro­fes­sion­als, who did not like the Govern­ment goad­ing them to set­tle down.”</p>
    <p>She met her 49-year-old hus­band, who runs a busi­ness con­sul­tancy, in ju­nior col­lege.</p>
    <p>With DHF, which she set up in end-2017, she fo­cuses on “high­net-worth in­di­vid­u­als with com­mit­ted re­la­tion­ships and mar­riage in mind”.</p>
    <p>Four in 10 of her clients – ei­ther di­vorced or wid­owed – are into their sec­ond or third mar­riages. One in four of the matches that re­sults in mar­riage are in­ter-eth­nic ones.</p>
    <p>Last year saw the high­est num­ber of cou­ples who di­vorced or an­nulled their mar­riages in Sin­ga­pore in at least 20 years, ac­cord­ing to data re­cently re­leased by the De­part­ment of Sta­tis­tics.</p>
    <p>The me­dian age at first mar­riage for men rose from 29.8 years in 2009 to 30.4 years, and from 27.5 years to 28.8 years for women.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore­ans spend more time get­ting an ed­u­ca­tion and build­ing their ca­reers, more are mar­ry­ing at a later age, so­ci­ol­o­gists and coun­sel­lors say.</p>
    <p>Ms Anisa’s client base of 900 is in­ter­na­tional – 60 per cent are lo­cals. The younger ones, aged be­tween 25 and 35, be­come her clients af­ter their par­ents ap­proach her, and are pre­dom­i­nantly from the South Asian com­mu­nity, where match­mak­ing and ar­ranged mar­riages are still com­mon prac­tices.</p>
    <p>DHF’s ser­vice com­prises two cat­e­gories: “luxe” and the more pre­mium “black la­bel”.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter is lim­ited to 50 clients – usu­ally men in their 40s to 60s – whom Ms Anisa per­son­ally sees to.</p>
    <p>She likens it to a “spe­cialised ser­vice, ver­sus go­ing to the gen­eral prac­ti­tioner” – she works with and talks to clients reg­u­larly be­fore she “gives her di­ag­no­sis”.</p>
    <p>She is sup­ported by two con­sul­tants, who help her with the matches, and two co­or­di­na­tors, who help set up dates or send flow­ers and some­times even a limou­sine to pick up dates.</p>
    <p>“Some clients tend to go the dis­tance be­cause money is no ob­ject, and they see it as a nicety,” she says.</p>
    <p>She works on a re­tainer ba­sis, typ­i­cally rang­ing from six months to a year, and prices vary from $1,000 to $5,500 a month.</p>
    <p>It de­pends on how far she has to reach into her global net­work to hunt for a match.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous searches have in­cluded a Filipino Chi­nese woman and a Pak­istani groom who fit the re­quire­ments of an up­per-class fam­ily here.</p>
    <p>The com­par­isons with elite In­dian match­maker Sima Ta­paria, the star of Net­flix’s hit re­al­ity se­ries In­dian Match­mak­ing – which has be­come some­what of a cul­tural phe­nom­e­non and sparked global in­ter­est in the world of match­mak­ing – are in­evitable.</p>
    <p>Like Ta­paria, who jets be­tween the United States and In­dia play­ing Cu­pid to young Indians, Ms Anisa gets flown to Qatar, Australia and other coun­tries to meet po­ten­tial clients and their fam­i­lies in their homes.</p>
    <p>“Es­pe­cially with South Asian clients, they like to in­tro­duce you to the fam­ily. It’s also a chance to get to know what these highly-charged in­di­vid­u­als do when they’re not work­ing,” she says.</p>
    <p>But un­like the in­fa­mous, some­times caus­tic Ta­paria, who will take on clients she does not like, Ms Anisa be­lieves in man­ag­ing the ex­pec­ta­tions of her clients from the start, so they can pur­sue an “equal part­ner­ship based on val­ues”.</p>
    <p>“I must also like them, so I can ad­vo­cate for them,” she adds.</p>
    <p>She does not feel threat­ened by the growth of dat­ing apps, which has eaten into the tra­di­tional match­mak­ing pie and which many of her clients are also us­ing.</p>
    <p>Be it Tin­der, Bum­ble or Hinge, she feels her ser­vice is “not com­pet­ing with, but com­ple­ment­ing” them.</p>
    <p>In fact, she even helps her clients op­ti­mise their pro­files on these apps, “to make sure they are get­ting good mileage and bet­ter hits”.</p>
    <p>But with the lofty goal of match­mak­ing “one mil­lion mar­riages”, Ms Anisa has also en­tered the dig­i­tal space with her own app, Joompa, which caters specif­i­cally to Mus­lim sin­gles in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The app, which soft-launched in Malaysia late last year, has more than 15,000 down­loads there. Sub­scrip­tion costs $9.95 to $60. Here, launch plans were thwarted by Covid-19, but she hopes to get it off the ground by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing that DHF’s high fees make it too in­ac­ces­si­ble to many, she says the app is more “mass mar­ket friendly”.</p>
    <p>“I’ve put my ex­per­tise and knowl­edge on the app, so you still get the Anisa touch,” she adds.</p>
