    <p>The South Korean cap­i­tal and its sur­round­ing ar­eas will ban meet­ings of more than four peo­ple in a bid to clamp down on year-end fes­tiv­i­ties and curb a third wave of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic gath­er­ing strength be­cause of clus­ters from so­cial gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Covid-19 cases here has bro­ken the 50,000 mark, with 926 new cases added yes­ter­day – down from Sun­day’s record­high of 1,097. This raises the to­tal tally to 50,591, with the death toll reach­ing 698 af­ter adding 24 new fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tion will be im­posed in Seoul, sur­round­ing Gyeonggi prov­ince, and nearby In­cheon city from to­mor­row to Jan 3.</p>
    <p>It will ap­ply to all kinds of pri­vate and cor­po­rate gath­er­ings, in­doors or out­doors, ex­cept wed­dings and fu­ner­als, where 50 peo­ple may still gather.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing the new mea­sure yes­ter­day, Act­ing Seoul Mayor Seo Jung-hyup said: “We can­not over­come the cur­rent cri­sis with­out re­duc­ing clus­ter in­fec­tions that are spread­ing through pri­vate gath­er­ings with fam­i­lies, friends and col­leagues.”</p>
    <p>He also urged all cit­i­zens to com­ply with the new rule, adding that the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion in Seoul is “like the calm be­fore the storm”.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal area ac­counts for about 70 per cent of the to­tal num­ber of cases, with Seoul alone re­port­ing a record-high 473 cases on Sun­day be­fore drop­ping to 328 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“This is our last chance to curb the out­break,” Mr Seo said.</p>
    <p>The mea­sure does not ap­ply to fam­i­lies with five or more mem­bers at the same reg­is­tered ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said they will fine peo­ple who flout the new ban and sus­pend busi­nesses and estab­lish­ments that al­low gath­er­ings of more than four peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The rule is stricter than cur­rent so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures for the cap­i­tal area, which ban gath­er­ings of 50 and more peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Calls have grown for so­cial dis­tanc­ing to be raised to the high­est level, which will for­bid gath­er­ings of 10 or more peo­ple and shut down over two mil­lion estab­lish­ments. But the gov­ern­ment has in­sisted this should be the last re­sort be­cause of con­cerns over the eco­nomic fall­out.</p>
    <p>As Mr Seo re­it­er­ated yes­ter­day: “We have to do every­thing we can do so that we don’t reach the fi­nal stage of Level 3, where our econ­omy and daily life will be dam­aged.”</p>
    <p>In­stead, health au­thor­i­ties are hop­ing to curb the out­break by tight­en­ing anti-virus mea­sures where they are most ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Se­nior health of­fi­cial Sohn Young-rae said yes­ter­day that more mea­sures aimed at curb­ing a pos­si­ble spread of the virus over the Christ­mas and New Year long week­ends will be an­nounced to­day. This could af­fect win­ter sports fa­cil­i­ties and beaches where peo­ple gather to watch the sun­rise on New Year’s Day.</p>
    <p>Given the new ban, ad­min­is­tra­tor Jenny Kim, 38, may have to can­cel a Christ­mas Eve gath­er­ing with 10 friends in Seoul.</p>
    <p>“We are con­sid­er­ing to gather at a venue out­side of Gyeonggi, but that would re­quire four to five hours of trav­el­ling time, so it may be too much trou­ble to ar­range,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Maybe I’ll just stay at home and watch a movie.”</p>
