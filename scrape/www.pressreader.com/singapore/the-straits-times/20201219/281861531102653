    <p>Se­nior Chi­nese lead­ers have pledged to main­tain “nec­es­sary sup­port” to keep up China’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery, as the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy con­tin­ues to face un­cer­tain­ties and head­winds.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials had pointed out that changes due to the Covid-19 pan­demic and the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment had cre­ated many un­cer­tain­ties, and the foundation for China’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery was “not solid”, ac­cord­ing to a read­out re­leased yes­ter­day evening by state news agency Xin­hua at the end of a key eco­nomic meet­ing.</p>
    <p>“The global eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion next year will re­main com­plex and se­vere, the re­cov­ery will be un­sta­ble and un­even, and var­i­ous risks caused by the im­pact of the epi­demic can­not be ig­nored,” said the Xin­hua com­mu­nique.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials had said dur­ing the three-day meet­ing to set out China’s eco­nomic pri­or­i­ties for the com­ing year that Bei­jing must main­tain “con­ti­nu­ity, sta­bil­ity and sus­tain­abil­ity” in its macro-eco­nomic poli­cies, adding that there would be no pol­icy U-turns.</p>
    <p>Held at the close of the year, the an­nual Cen­tral Eco­nomic Work Con­fer­ence was at­tended by top Chi­nese lead­ers – in­clud­ing Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and Pre­mier Li Ke­qiang – as well as of­fi­cials from the Cen­tral Com­mit­tee of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) and the State Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The closed-door meet­ing is closely watched by ob­servers for in­di­ca­tions on what pol­icy direc­tions China will take mov­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s econ­omy is ex­pected to grow about 2 per cent this year, the only ma­jor econ­omy to reg­is­ter pos­i­tive growth against the back­drop of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts ex­pect China to post 2021 growth of up to 8 per cent, on the back of this low base.</p>
    <p>Next year will be key for China as it marks the 100th an­niver­sary of the CCP, and is also the first year of the coun­try’s new five-year de­vel­op­ment plan.</p>
    <p>Other pol­icy pri­or­i­ties laid out by of­fi­cials in­clude boost­ing do­mes­tic con­sump­tion, strength­en­ing the in­de­pen­dence of in­dus­trial sup­ply chains, and boost­ing China’s strength in strate­gic tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Taken to­gether, they con­sti­tute a broader pol­icy aimed at in­creas­ing self-re­liance and mit­i­gat­ing the im­pact from the tech­no­log­i­cal and eco­nomic de­cou­pling that Wash­ing­ton has pur­sued in the last few years, said ob­servers.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts must fo­cus on “solv­ing the ma­jor prob­lems that re­strict the coun­try’s de­vel­op­ment and se­cu­rity”, said Xin­hua.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi had put forth a “dual cir­cu­la­tion strat­egy” this year that is meant to re­duce China’s re­liance on ex­ter­nal mar­kets. Part of the strat­egy in­volves boost­ing do­mes­tic de­mand and con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>“The most fun­da­men­tal thing about ex­pand­ing con­sump­tion is to pro­mote em­ploy­ment, im­prove so­cial se­cu­rity, op­ti­mise in­come distri­bu­tion, ex­pand the mid­dle in­come group, and solidly pro­mote com­mon pros­per­ity,” re­ported Xin­hua yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Chi­nese lead­ers also pledged to strengthen anti-mo­nop­oly ef­forts in the com­ing year, as Bei­jing moves to en­hance su­per­vi­sion of its large tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>They pointed to the need to “strengthen reg­u­la­tion, en­hance su­per­vi­sion ca­pa­bil­i­ties, and res­o­lutely oppose mo­nop­oly and un­fair com­pe­ti­tion”, said Xin­hua.</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nique added that of­fi­cials agreed “fi­nan­cial in­no­va­tion must be car­ried out un­der the premise of care­ful su­per­vi­sion”.</p>
    <p>Th­ese com­ments are the lat­est in­di­ca­tion that Bei­jing will rein in the in­flu­ence of its large tech com­pa­nies, fol­low­ing last month’s re­lease of draft reg­u­la­tions tar­geted at mo­nop­o­lis­tic prac­tices in the In­ter­net industry.</p>
    <p>Last month, reg­u­la­tors also pulled the plug on Ant Group’s planned US$37 bil­lion (S$49 bil­lion) ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>Shang­hai-based in­de­pen­dent economist Ye Tan said this year’s con­fer­ence showed pol­i­cy­mak­ers were still wor­ried about the un­cer­tain­ties posed by China’s ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment, and sta­bil­is­ing the econ­omy is still the first pri­or­ity.</p>
