    <p>KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia yes­ter­day re­ported 10 deaths caused by Covid-19, the high­est death toll from the dis­ease in a sin­gle day since Covid-19 was tracked in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Eight of the 10 fa­tal­i­ties were from Sabah, the epi­cen­tre of the out­break in Malaysia in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing two deaths were re­ported in Labuan and Kedah. The coun­try’s death toll stood at 214.</p>
    <p>There were a to­tal of 710 in­fec­tions re­ported yes­ter­day, the sev­enth day in a row that daily cases ex­ceeded 700. Malaysia hit a record high of 871 cases in a day on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Sabah state yes­ter­day again logged the high­est num­ber with 528 cases, or 74.3 per cent of the 710 daily cases. This was fol­lowed by Se­lan­gor (62), Pe­nang (39), Negeri Sem­bi­lan (37) and the fed­eral ter­ri­tory of Labuan (19).</p>
    <p>The surge and spread of in­fec­tions all over the coun­try in the last few weeks have been mostly blamed on the two-week elec­tion cam­paign­ing pe­riod be­fore the Sept 26 Sabah state polls. Po­lit­i­cal cam­paign­ers from the elec­tion later went back to their home states to spread the highly con­ta­gious dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The triple-digit figures yes­ter­day brought the cu­mu­la­tive to­tal re­ported in the coun­try to 24,514, with ac­tive cases at 8,416.</p>
    <p>There are now 90 peo­ple be­ing treated in in­ten­sive care units, with 28 of them re­quir­ing ven­ti­la­tor sup­port.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, even as the public re­mains anx­ious that po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity due to Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s weak hold on power could re­sult in a gen­eral elec­tion soon, an­other state is mulling over when to call state polls.</p>
    <p>Sarawak, Malaysia’s big­gest state by land size, must hold its polls by June next year, or the state as­sem­bly will au­to­mat­i­cally dis­solve at the end of its five-year term.</p>
    <p>Sarawak typ­i­cally holds its state polls sep­a­rately from Malaysia’s gen­eral elec­tion, though its 31 fed­eral MPs are elected dur­ing na­tional polls. The 82-seat Sarawak as­sem­bly is dom­i­nated by the four­party Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak coali­tion, which has 72 seats.</p>
    <p>Sarawak Chief Min­is­ter Abang Jo­hari Tun Openg said: “We are sub­ject to ad­vice from the Health Min­istry on whether we should go (for an elec­tion) or not. I am also con­cerned about the health of the peo­ple.”</p>
