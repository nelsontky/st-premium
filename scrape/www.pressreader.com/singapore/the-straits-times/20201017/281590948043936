    <p>The high-pro­file spat between marathoner Soh Rui Yong and Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) is over af­ter the two-time SEA Games cham­pion agreed to with­draw his law­suit against SA, which fol­lowed his non-se­lec­tion for the 2019 SEA Games. The cease­fire is a boost for the new SA man­age­ment team, who were elected on Sept 25.</p>
    <p>One of the most high-pro­file spats in lo­cal sport has ended, with marathoner Soh Rui Yong dis­con­tin­u­ing his law­suit against Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA).</p>
    <p>In a state­ment posted on its web­site yes­ter­day, the na­tional track and field body said that two-time SEA Games marathon cham­pion Soh has agreed to “with­draw and dis­con­tinue” his law­suit that fol­lowed his non-se­lec­tion for the 2019 SEA Games.</p>
    <p>Just hours later, SA ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ma­lik Alju­nied, who is also in­volved in a le­gal dis­pute with Soh, an­nounced his depar­ture from SA.</p>
    <p>He in­formed the me­dia that he would be re­turn­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Olympic Coun­cil (SNOC), his pre­vi­ous em­ployer.</p>
    <p>The truce with Soh marks a ma­jor boost for the new SA man­age­ment team, led by Lien Choong Luen, who were elected into power by af­fil­i­ates on Sept 25. Among their cam­paign promises was a pledge to pri­ori­tise the res­o­lu­tion of le­gal is­sues SA had be­come em­broiled in over the last two years.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, SA said: “Through ex­ten­sive en­gage­ment with Mr Soh by the new lead­er­ship in the two weeks since as­sum­ing of­fice, we are pleased to an­nounce that (SA) and Mr Soh have agreed to put an end to all their dis­agree­ments, and dou­ble down on ef­forts to work to­gether for the bet­ter­ment of the ath­let­ics com­mu­nity, the sport, and the na­tion’s re­gional and in­ter­na­tional as­pi­ra­tions.”</p>
    <p>SA said it “with­draws un­con­di­tion­ally” the por­tions of its me­dia state­ment dated Aug 3, 2019 stat­ing that Soh had “on sev­eral oc­ca­sions breached (SA’s) Ath­letic Code of Con­duct” and “or his trans­gres­sions, (SA) had at­tempted to coun­sel and rea­son with him, as part of a holis­tic re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion process”.</p>
    <p>The na­tional body also ex­tended its “sincere apol­ogy” to Soh for any in­con­ve­nience and dis­tress that the state­ments caused him, and will stand down dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings ini­ti­ated on Sept 25 by the out­go­ing SA man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>On his part, Soh agreed to with­draw and dis­con­tinue his law­suit against SA, and ac­knowl­edged his re­spon­si­bil­ity that as one of the coun­try’s “bright­est ath­let­ics prospects”, he is a role model for younger ath­letes.</p>
    <p>He “will hence­forth work with SA and the SNOC to pro­mote a pos­i­tive im­age of the sport to the best of his abil­ity,” added the state­ment.</p>
    <p>SA also said that it is “com­mit­ted to sup­port­ing Mr Soh to once again don na­tional colours and com­pete for Sin­ga­pore against the best in the re­gion and the world”, as he aims to be­come the first Sin­ga­porean man to qual­ify for the Com­mon­wealth Games Marathon and Asian Games Marathon.</p>
    <p>SA’s an­nounce­ment comes four days af­ter a suc­cess­ful High Court ap­pli­ca­tion by its for­mer le­gal coun­sel, Mahmood Gaz­navi of Mahmood Gaz­navi & Part­ners, to strike out Soh’s al­le­ga­tion of mal­ice in the suit.</p>
    <p>Soh told The Straits Times: “I’d like to thank Lien and his team for the ex­ten­sive ef­fort they have put into this to make things work. I look</p>
    <p>JUST THE ME­DI­A­TOR</p>
    <p>We serve to help sup­port the ath­letes and the sport… I’m merely a small mid­dle­man in all of this.</p>

    <p>LOOK­ING AHEAD</p>
    <p>I look for­ward to work­ing with them over the next two years, and hope­fully be­yond, to bring SA to new heights.</p>

    <p>When con­tacted, Lien played down his team’s role in the mend­ing of fences. He, in­stead cred­ited</p>
    <p>Soh and the SNOC, as well as Soh’s lawyer Clarence Lun of Fox­wood LLC, and SA’s new le­gal team Break­point LLC.</p>
    <p>On Ma­lik step­ping down, he said: “Ma­lik was on sec­ond­ment from SNOC to serve as the gen­eral man­ager and then in SA, and he has re­quested to re­turn to SNOC, which we ac­ceded to. SA is grate­ful for his con­tri­bu­tions over the past 11/2 years.”</p>
