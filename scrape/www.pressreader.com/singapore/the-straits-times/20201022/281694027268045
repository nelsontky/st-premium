    <p>State-owned Chi­nese phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Sinopharm Group is set­ting up pro­duc­tion lines to sup­ply one bil­lion doses of two Covid-19 vac­cines cur­rently in the fi­nal stages of test­ing, ac­cord­ing to me­dia reports.</p>
    <p>Its chair­man Liu Jingzhen said at a news con­fer­ence on Tues­day that the vac­cines will be safe, but gave no in­di­ca­tion of when test­ing re­sults are ex­pected.</p>
    <p>He added that Sinopharm is “in the last kilo­me­tre of a long march” and pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity will reach one bil­lion doses next year.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion lines are be­ing set up in Bei­jing and Wuhan, the city in cen­tral China where Covid-19 first emerged.</p>
    <p>So far, about 60,000 vol­un­teers have been in­oc­u­lated with four Chi­nese vac­cines in Phase III tri­als, ac­cord­ing to a China Daily re­port yes­ter­day which cited a Chi­nese gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>No se­vere ad­verse re­ac­tion has been re­ported among the vol­un­teers, the of­fi­cial said, adding that pre­lim­i­nary re­sults show that the vac­cines are gen­er­ally safe and have mi­nor side ef­fects such as pain and bruis­ing at the in­jec­tion site, as well as tem­po­rary low-grade fever.</p>
    <p>But Western news out­lets have ques­tioned China’s haste to in­oc­u­late cit­i­zens with vac­cines still in late-stage test­ing, cit­ing ex­perts who are wor­ried about is­sues of con­sent among vol­un­teers who are tak­ing the vac­cines, as well as po­ten­tial harm­ful side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a Sept 26 New York Times re­port, China has so far dosed em­ploy­ees at state-owned com­pa­nies and gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, among other work­ers it con­sid­ers es­sen­tial.</p>
    <p>“China’s rush has bewil­dered ex­perts,” the re­port said. “No other coun­try has in­jected peo­ple with un­proven vac­cines out­side the drug trial process to such a huge scale.”</p>
    <p>But Mr Zheng Zhong­wei, a direc­tor at China’s Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion, said on Tues­day that the roll-out is jus­ti­fied, given the risk of Covid-19 re­turn­ing through its borders and the lack of sig­nif­i­cant side ef­fects so far from the shots given to vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>Mr Zheng, who is over­see­ing Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­op­ment, added that China is still fac­ing pres­sure from im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>China’s emer­gency-use pa­ram­e­ters were ap­proved af­ter rig­or­ous de­lib­er­a­tion among vac­cine and ethics ex­perts, and with the back­ing of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO), said Mr Zheng.</p>
    <p>At a WHO meet­ing in May, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said Covid-19 vac­cines pro­duced by China will be a global pub­lic good. He pledged US$2 bil­lion (S$2.71 bil­lion) over the next two years to tackle the virus.</p>
    <p>Me­dia reports sug­gest China is in a hurry to win the global race to de­velop a vac­cine, to dis­pel crit­i­cism that it had mis­han­dled the pan­demic in its ini­tial stages and boost its im­age.</p>
    <p>On Oct 8, China signed on to Covax, the WHO-backed ini­tia­tive for the dis­tri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines, join­ing 170 other na­tions.</p>
    <p>China said it had been as­sist­ing Chi­nese vac­cine re­search and de­vel­op­ment com­pa­nies par­tic­i­pat­ing in Covax, to pro­vide vac­cines for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“This will be China’s con­tri­bu­tion to en­sur­ing vac­cine ac­ces­si­bil­ity and af­ford­abil­ity in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries,” said For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing.</p>
