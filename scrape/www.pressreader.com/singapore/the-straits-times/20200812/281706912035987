    <p>As the econ­omy and travel grad­u­ally restart, mi­grant work­ers re-en­ter­ing both the coun­try and the work­force pose po­ten­tial Covid-19 risks. To ad­dress this, the au­thor­i­ties have turned to dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy, us­ing tools like apps and wear­able GPS de­vices to keep track of their health and move­ments.</p>
    <p>Se­nior gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials told The Straits Times that such tech­no­log­i­cal so­lu­tions have led to great sav­ings in man­power and re­sources, and it would be oth­er­wise un­think­able to han­dle the vast num­bers and lo­gis­tics in­volved.</p>
    <p>MON­I­TOR­ING DE­VICES</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ally re­opens, the ef­fort to keep in­fec­tions low starts at the bor­ders.</p>
    <p>From 11.59pm on Mon­day, in­bound trav­ellers, with some ex­cep­tions, would have started wear­ing elec­tronic de­vices to en­sure they serve their 14-day manda­tory stayhome no­tice (SHN) prop­erly.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) is­sues one de­vice for work pass hold­ers and their de­pen­dants stay­ing out­side ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties, while the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity (ICA) an­nounced last week that it will be is­su­ing a dif­fer­ent set for other trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>MOM’s de­vice is ba­si­cally a smart­watch that alerts the min­istry if its wearer leaves his or her place of res­i­dence. Once a worker clears im­mi­gra­tion, of­fi­cers tag them with it and make sure it is func­tional, af­ter which the de­vice is locked and can­not be re­moved un­til the SHN ends.</p>
    <p>Al­though the ICA and MOM de­vices are both worn on the wrist and serve sim­i­lar func­tions, they do so in dif­fer­ent ways.</p>
    <p>ICA’s wrist­band de­vice uses an app and an­other “gate­way” de­vice that must be plugged into a power socket at the res­i­dence. It uses Blue­tooth sig­nals, and alerts the au­thor­i­ties if the dis­tance be­tween the wrist­band and gate­way at home gets too large, but can­not re­lay the ex­act cur­rent lo­ca­tion of its wearer.</p>
    <p>MOM’s de­vice works on its own with­out need­ing an app or an ad­di­tional de­vice. Un­like ICA’s wrist­band, it uses GPS and 4G tech­nol­ogy and can tech­ni­cally track the wearer’s spe­cific cur­rent lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The smart­watch has other fea­tures, in­clud­ing a heart­beat sen­sor, al­low­ing MOM to track the worker’s health. As is the case with the ICA de­vice, any at­tempt to tam­per with the smart­watch or re­move it will trig­ger an alert to the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Last week, an ICA spokesman said the two de­vices were sep­a­rate so­lu­tions, but this is not due to dif­fer­ences in op­er­a­tional needs. He said MOM and ICA would as­sess the suitabilit­y of their re­spec­tive de­vices in time and a de­ci­sion will be made on any changes for op­er­a­tional needs.</p>
    <p>Mr Don Yeo, se­nior as­sis­tant di­rec­tor in MOM’s for­eign man­power man­age­ment depart­ment, said the main pur­pose of MOM’s de­vice was for it to be a stand­alone tool that could mon­i­tor work­ers round the clock.</p>
    <p>The de­vice sig­nif­i­cantly re­duces the amount of man­power needed to mon­i­tor work­ers, he added. “With our cur­rent modus operandi, we call the worker about once a day (dur­ing the stay-home pe­riod). But with the watch, if the wearer is com­pli­ant, we need to do only one or two calls for the en­tire 14 days.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said no data is stored on the de­vice. Any sent back to MOM’s servers is en­crypted, and will not be re­tained be­yond six months from the end of the SHN in most cases.</p>
    <p>Within 24 hours af­ter his SHN ends, the worker goes to a re­turn point where the de­vice is re­moved and dis­in­fected for fu­ture use.</p>
    <p>While Mr Yeo could not share de­tails on the cost or num­ber of de­vices, he said de­vel­op­ment started in May, and they were man­u­fac­tured by a third-party ven­dor ac­cord­ing to MOM’s spec­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>TRACK­ING HEALTH, MOVE­MENT</p>
    <p>With test­ing com­pleted for all of the 323,000 mi­grant work­ers, the au­thor­i­ties have put in place sev­eral safety mea­sures to make sure their re­turn to work is not marred by a spike in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>These mea­sures, how­ever, also mean a great deal of co­or­di­na­tion be­hind the scenes – both in terms of the move­ment and health of work­ers in­side dorms and be­tween nu­mer­ous gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>MOM launched the FWMOMCare mo­bile app on May 18 to mon­i­tor work­ers’ health, said Mr Sing Khang Leng, the min­istry’s chief in­for­ma­tion of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>The app is used by over 414,000 work­ers – the ma­jor­ity of whom re­side in dorms – to re­port their health sta­tus to the au­thor­i­ties, and also to scan QR codes at dif­fer­ent lo­ca­tions, such as within dorm rooms, to re­port their where­abouts.</p>
    <p>Apart from reg­is­ter­ing their tem­per­a­tures, it asks work­ers if they have symp­toms like short­ness of breath or runny nose, and tracks their oxy­gen lev­els and heart rate. If un­well, the work­ers are prompted to use a tele­con­sul­ta­tion ser­vice run by the Health Min­istry, typ­i­cally avail­able within half an hour. The dorm op­er­a­tor and the worker’s em­ployer are also in­formed, said Mr Sing.</p>
    <p>New fea­tures have been grad­u­ally added. For ex­am­ple, since July 23, the app can dis­play elec­tronic dis­charge memos for work­ers who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19. Is­sued by MOH, the memo is pro­tected from tam­per­ing by dig­i­tal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion us­ing blockchain tech­nol­ogy from lo­cal firm Ac­cred­ify.</p>
    <p>RE­SUM­ING WORK SAFELY</p>
    <p>The FWMOMCare app is com­ple­mented by a mas­sive dig­i­tal sys­tem used to track the work sta­tus of over one mil­lion work­ers.</p>
    <p>Called Ac­cessCode, the “traf­fic light” sys­tem, as Mr Sing de­scribed it, gives a green sta­tus for work­ers who are al­lowed to re­turn to work and red for those who are not.</p>
    <p>On the front end, the process is sim­ple enough. Work­ers flash the SGWorkPass mo­bile app and are al­lowed to leave their dorms for work if it has a green Ac­cessCode sta­tus.</p>
    <p>Their sta­tus is also checked when they use FWMOMCare to scan a QR code be­fore they en­ter their work­place. Separately, MOM launched the Safe@Work on­line ser­vice for em­ploy­ers to check the sta­tus of all their work­ers.</p>
    <p>But this is pos­si­ble only be­cause mas­sive co­or­di­na­tion is tak­ing place be­hind the scenes be­tween mul­ti­ple gov­ern­ment bod­ies, eas­ily in­volv­ing over 100 of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem pulls to­gether nu­mer­ous cri­te­ria, in­clud­ing the worker’s health, whether he has in­stalled the TraceTo­gether mo­bile app, whether his dorm has been cleared of Covid-19, and whether his em­ployer has been ap­proved to restart work. The last in­volves the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try and sec­tor agen­cies like the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity and the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board.</p>
    <p>To de­velop the app, MOM worked with the Defence Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy Agency and GovTech, mak­ing use of an ex­ist­ing gov­ern­ment com­put­ing cloud to se­curely han­dle the data. It took about three to four weeks of de­vel­op­ment be­fore the sys­tem was launched in early June.</p>
    <p>Mr Sing said that there are “a lot of mov­ing pieces” and ul­ti­mately all par­ties – in­clud­ing em­ploy­ers and dorm op­er­a­tors – need to play their part. “As much as we want to au­to­mate many of these pro­cesses, the re­al­ity is that there are cer­tain gaps that still hap­pen,” he said.</p>
    <p>These in­clude things like the ac­cu­racy of data, such as the res­i­dence and other de­tails of the worker.</p>
    <p>“If you pump in bad data, you get bad out­comes. The sys­tem is only as in­tel­li­gent as the data you put in,” he said, adding that MOM of­fi­cers are con­stantly clean­ing data even as they im­prove the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said that with­out tech­nol­ogy, it would have been “hu­manly im­pos­si­ble” to man­u­ally co­or­di­nate the thou­sands of work­ers stay­ing in the dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>“It would be to­tally un­sus­tain­able and un­re­al­is­tic to com­pile the data from tem­per­a­ture checks and clear work­ers to leave the dorms for work man­u­ally. So if we did not have a tech so­lu­tion, I can’t imag­ine what would hap­pen,” he said.</p>
