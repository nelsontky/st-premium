    <p>More than $1.86 mil­lion worth of book­ings were made with Sin­gapo-Redis­cov­ers vouch­ers yes­ter­day, when the scheme to give the tourism in­dus­try here a boost kicked off.</p>
    <p>By 4.30pm, the au­tho­rised book­ing plat­forms re­ceived more than 11,900 book­ings. Some of­fer­ings were even sold out.</p>
    <p>The Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers voucher scheme got off to a strong start yes­ter­day with a flurry of on­line book­ings, re­sult­ing in some of­fer­ings be­ing sold out by mid­day.</p>
    <p>As at 4.30pm yes­ter­day, the five ap­pointed book­ing plat­forms had re­ceived more than 11,900 book­ings, to­talling about $1.86 mil­lion in vouch­ers and pay­ments, the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) said in a state­ment last night.</p>
    <p>The $100 tourism vouch­ers cred­ited yes­ter­day to all adult Sin­ga­pore­ans have so far led to a good mix of book­ings across ho­tels, at­trac­tions and tours, said STB, adding that there has been healthy in­ter­est in bun­dled pack­ages.</p>
    <p>Ms An­gel Ho was among those who be­gan brows­ing the of­fer­ings at mid­night, when the five book­ing plat­forms – Changi Rec­om­mends, Glob­alTix, Trav­eloka, Trip.com and Klook – went live with their voucher-ap­pli­ca­ble stay­ca­tions, at­trac­tion tick­ets and tours.</p>
    <p>Ms Ho, 32, said the mul­ti­ple plat­forms made for a te­dious search, although the re­demp­tion process was smooth.</p>
    <p>She booked a pack­age on Glob­alTix for two adults and two chil­dren to visit the Sin­ga­pore Zoo and River Sa­fari, pay­ing $60 af­ter the $100 voucher dis­count.</p>
    <p>“To me, $60 for my fam­ily of four to both parks is rea­son­able. With­out the vouch­ers, I doubt I would want to spend that much,” said the lo­gis­tics ad­min­is­tra­tor.</p>
    <p>While no ma­jor tech­ni­cal is­sues were re­ported yes­ter­day, some said they had prob­lems re­deem­ing their vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>Housewife Shin-Yu Tan said she tried to book tick­ets to Snow City for her fam­ily of four on Klook yes­ter­day morn­ing, but was met with an er­ror mes­sage af­ter ap­ply­ing the gen­er­ated voucher code.</p>
    <p>As her hus­band had al­ready taken leave for their in­tended date, Mrs Tan, 33, ended up pay­ing the full price of $86.20 for the tick­ets and glove rentals.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries, Klook said cus­tomers may have ex­pe­ri­enced dif­fi­culty com­plet­ing their book­ings as some pop­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties were sold out.</p>
    <p>Ms Sarah Wan, Klook’s mar­ket­ing di­rec­tor for South-east Asia, apol­o­gised to cus­tomers for the in­con­ve­nience, adding that Klook has been work­ing with mer­chants to en­sure that in­ven­tory is re­stocked as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>More than 280 prod­ucts are avail­able for re­demp­tion across the five plat­forms, STB said yes­ter­day, adding that more value-for-money deals will be rolled out over the next seven months.</p>
    <p>While tour and at­trac­tion op­er­a­tors had ex­pressed con­cern that a large part of the vouch­ers’ worth would go to­wards stay­ca­tions, the re­stric­tion against pool­ing vouch­ers for a sin­gle trans­ac­tion ended up dis­cour­ag­ing some con­sumers from pick­ing this op­tion.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tions man­ager Caleb Tan, 48, said the stay­ca­tion pack­ages on of­fer were too ex­pen­sive and that he would book hol­i­day ac­tiv­i­ties for his two chil­dren in­stead.</p>
    <p>“The $100 can barely cover half the cost of one night at a de­cent four- or five-star ho­tel,” he said.</p>
    <p>The $320 mil­lion Sin­gapo-Redis­cov­ers credit scheme, meant to boost Sin­ga­pore’s tourism sec­tor, is the first na­tional dig­i­tal-only voucher pro­gramme to be rolled out by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Those who face dif­fi­cul­ties nav­i­gat­ing the on­line sites and need as­sis­tance can visit any of the 69 phys­i­cal coun­ters set up at com­mu­nity cen­tres and other lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Taxi driver Ng Beng Lam, 72, and his wife Ong Choon Hwa, 68, were the first in line to make a book­ing at Tampines East Com­mu­nity Cen­tre yes­ter­day morn­ing. They ar­rived an hour be­fore the coun­ters op­er­ated by Klook and UOB Travel Plan­ners opened at 10am.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple booked tick­ets for the Sands SkyPark and Ob­ser­va­tion Deck at Ma­rina Bay Sands, and the Sin­ga­pore Flyer, spend­ing about half of their vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>“This is a chance for my fam­ily and I to visit th­ese at­trac­tions af­ter this tough year,” said Mr Ng.</p>
    <p>There seemed to be no rush to make a book­ing at the phys­i­cal coun­ters yes­ter­day, with no more than 10 peo­ple seen vis­it­ing the coun­ters at Tampines East Com­mu­nity Cen­tre be­tween 11am and noon.</p>
    <p>Bank em­ployee Josh See, 38, plans to wait un­til the school hol­i­days are over be­fore us­ing his vouch­ers. “I’ll prob­a­bly use them for at­trac­tions but I don’t want to deal with the crowds. Plus, the book­ing process sounds messy so I’ll let them work out the kinks first.”</p>
