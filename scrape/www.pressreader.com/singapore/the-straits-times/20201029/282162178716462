    <p>The high-wa­ter mark for semi­con­duc­tor deals was reached in 2016, when US$122 bil­lion in trans­ac­tions were struck for the en­tire year. If ac­qui­si­tions con­tinue at the cur­rent pace, this year will eas­ily top that level. The largest deal of 2016 was SoftBank Group’s US$24 bil­lion pur­chase of Arm.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ad­vanced Mi­cro De­vices’ (AMD) US$35 bil­lion (S$47.8 bil­lion) pur­chase of ri­val semi­con­duc­tor maker Xil­inx pushes 2020 to­wards a record year for chip deals, as large tech com­pa­nies rush to con­sol­i­date the in­creas­ingly com­pet­i­tive in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>There have now been US$110 bil­lion of deals an­nounced in the semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try this year, led by Nvidia’s US$40 bil­lion bid for chip de­signer Arm, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>The Xil­inx deal makes 2020 the big­gest year at this point on record for pend­ing and com­pleted deals in­volv­ing semi­con­duc­tors, the data shows.</p>
    <p>The high-wa­ter mark for semi­con­duc­tor deals was reached in 2016, when US$122 bil­lion in trans­ac­tions were struck for the en­tire year.</p>
    <p>If ac­qui­si­tions con­tinue at the cur­rent pace, this year will eas­ily top that level. The largest deal of 2016 was SoftBank Group’s US$24 bil­lion pur­chase of Arm.</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion in the semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try is hot­ting up as com­pa­nies that were once cus­tomers, such as Ap­ple, de­sign their own chips and es­tab­lished play­ers like Nvidia branch out into new ar­eas.</p>
    <p>One ad­viser es­ti­mates that there are 75 pub­lic chip com­pa­nies now and that num­ber could be cut in half be­cause of con­sol­i­da­tion in the next few years.</p>
    <p>With the Arm deal, Nvidia gets ac­cess to semi­con­duc­tor de­signs that are in most smart­phones and li­cences for chips that run thou­sands of ap­pli­ances known as the In­ter­net of Things.</p>
    <p>Buy­ing San Francisco-based Xil­inx gives AMD ac­cess to pro­gram­mable chips for wire­less tele­coms net­works ahead of phone car­ri­ers’ plans to build out high-speed fifth­gen­er­a­tion mo­bile net­works. It also helps the firm ex­pand fur­ther in the prof­itable mar­ket for data-cen­tre com­puter com­po­nents, cur­rently dom­i­nated by In­tel. Ear­lier this month, In­tel agreed to sell its Nand mem­ory unit to South Korea’s SK Hynix for about US$9 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>These ri­val­ries have made the in­dus­try stand out in an oth­er­wise slug­gish deal mar­ket. Glob­ally, merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions in all sec­tors are down roughly 23 per cent to about US$1.9 tril­lion from the same pe­riod last year, Bloomberg data shows.</p>
