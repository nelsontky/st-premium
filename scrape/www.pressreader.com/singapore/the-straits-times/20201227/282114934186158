    <p>For em­ploy­ees’ re­la­tion­ship to work to change mean­ing­fully, com­pa­nies need to start think­ing about it now. What has pre­vi­ously been sub­text will have to be­come text. If your de­part­ment all comes in on Thurs­days, what do you do with that valu­able weekly time? Which meet­ings are es­sen­tial, which could be silent, or a sim­ple progress update?</p>
    <p>There’s a com­mon re­frain among peo­ple who’ve been ma­rooned in their homes this year, try­ing to man­age their jobs and their chil­dren’s dis­tance learn­ing, al­ways fight­ing the los­ing bat­tle against the dishes, the laun­dry, the dog hair, the gro­cery list. “I can­not wait to get back to the of­fice,” they say.</p>
    <p>But peo­ple don’t re­ally want to get back to the of­fice. They want to get out of their apart­ments, their houses, their par­ents’ houses.</p>
    <p>They want their chil­dren back in school and also out of the house. They want to see peo­ple’s faces again, and have con­ver­sa­tions with peo­ple who are closer than 2m from them. But that doesn’t mean they ac­tu­ally want to be back in the of­fice – at least not the way the of­fice was be­fore.</p>
    <p>Many com­pa­nies are prepar­ing to bring em­ploy­ees back in the spring or sum­mer, de­pend­ing on how fast the Covid-19 vac­cines are rolled out. Pic­ture it: At first, the of­fice will feel like the first day of school, se­nior year – ev­ery­thing’s fa­mil­iar and all your old com­forts are there, and ev­ery­one’s thrilled to have the sort of prox­im­ity we’ve ac­tively avoided for months.</p>
    <p>But the old an­noy­ances will ar­rive right on sched­ule. The com­mute will still be long; there will still be too many meet­ings and time-sucks; it’ll still feel like a mad rush to get out the door in the morn­ing or get dinner on the table at night. The ques­tion will present it­self: Why, again, do we in­sist on trav­el­ling to an of­fice ev­ery day?</p>
    <p>When I talked to dozens of an­a­lysts, hu­man re­source ex­perts, ar­chi­tects, con­sul­tants, real es­tate agents and of­fice fur­ni­ture de­sign­ers, the con­sen­sus was clear: The fu­ture of of­fice work is flex­i­bil­ity. At one end of that flex­i­bil­ity spec­trum, there will be fully “dis­trib­uted” com­pa­nies like the soft­ware maker GitLab, with no head­quar­ters and em­ploy­ees scat­tered world­wide. At the other, there’ll be more old-fash­ioned or­gan­i­sa­tions that de­mand face time in the of­fice, but whose be­lief in the in­fea­si­bil­ity of re­mote work has been per­ma­nently un­der­cut.</p>
    <p>And then there’s the vast cor­po­rate in be­tween. Head­quar­ters aren’t go­ing away, but more com­pa­nies will em­brace the hub-and-spoke model: smaller foot­prints in big, ex­pen­sive cities, and smaller of­fices in places where em­ploy­ees want – and can af­ford – to live. Some com­pa­nies will keep their ex­ist­ing of­fice space and al­low peo­ple to claim stag­gered sched­ules that align with their pref­er­ences, avoid peak com­mut­ing times and re­duce over­all ca­pac­ity in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers will try what used to be known as “hot de­sk­ing”, in which mul­ti­ple work­ers share a desk. Still oth­ers will of­fer stipends for em­ploy­ees to join the small neigh­bour­hood-ori­ented work­ing spa­ces that will pro­lif­er­ate as Amer­i­cans get vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple will be leav­ing their homes, hav­ing con­ver­sa­tions, work­ing with oth­ers – which is what they ac­tu­ally miss when they say they miss the of­fice. They’ll just be do­ing it more on their terms.</p>
    <p>There are prob­lems, of course, with each of these sce­nar­ios.</p>
    <p>Let peo­ple do what they want and the pre-pan­demic power dy­nam­ics of the of­fice will sim­ply re­pro­duce them­selves. No one, for ex­am­ple, should be al­lowed to go to the of­fice ev­ery day – oth­er­wise it’ll just be­come yet an­other way to prove your­self the better, more present worker. And the em­ploy­ees most likely to em­brace the flex­i­bil­ity of work­ing from home are the same peo­ple ex­pected to per­form the ma­jor­ity of labour in the home: women.</p>
    <p>Re­mote work will have to be viewed as equally important as in-per­son work. In prac­tice, that means re­think­ing what re­mote work­ing ac­tu­ally looks like – that is, very lit­tle like what we’re do­ing now. We’re not just work­ing from home, af­ter all. We’re work­ing from home dur­ing a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>We might have hap­haz­ardly ar­rived at work­arounds but there’s still so much more to de­velop, whether in terms of ded­i­cated heads of re­mote work, or tech­nol­ogy that ac­tu­ally makes hy­brid in-per­son and re­mote meet­ings feel less awk­ward.</p>
    <p>“I think the fu­ture is ac­tu­ally hav­ing to man­age peo­ple,” said Mr Adam Segel, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Cove, which helps com­pa­nies or­gan­ise shared desk and con­fer­ence space. “The de­fault set­ting right now is that you just see peo­ple in the of­fice and that’s how you man­age them. But now, peo­ple ac­tu­ally have to learn how to com­mu­ni­cate about the work that you’re do­ing, about pro­duc­tiv­ity, about ex­pec­ta­tions.”</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies that are cre­at­ing the tech, the flex­i­ble of­fice space, the mo­du­lar, high-turnover con­fer­ence rooms – they’re ready. But ev­ery­one else still seems to be in main­te­nance mode.</p>
    <p>“I haven’t heard from any­body who’s think­ing about how we’re go­ing to make ‘Work­ing Par­ent­ing 2.0’ or ‘Flex­i­bil­ity 2.0’ work,” said Ms Daisy Dowl­ing, who runs a con­sult­ing and coach­ing busi­ness for work­ing par­ents.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are too as­saulted right now and they haven’t quite got to the plan­ning yet. But that’s kind of scary be­cause when we do get there, they won’t have the struc­tures in place.”</p>
    <p>If the struc­tures aren’t in place, piece­meal hy­brid sched­ules will fail and we’ll end up right back where we were be­fore.</p>
    <p>For em­ploy­ees’ re­la­tion­ship to work to change mean­ing­fully, com­pa­nies need to start think­ing about it now. What has pre­vi­ously been sub­text will have to be­come text. If your de­part­ment all comes in on Thurs­days, what do you do with that valu­able weekly time? Which meet­ings are es­sen­tial, which could be silent or a sim­ple progress update?</p>
    <p>If you take the train into the city only once a week, that day be­comes use­ful: a time just for col­lab­o­ra­tion and ideas, in­stead of just an­other day spent end­lessly tog­gling be­tween e-mails and meet­ings, do­ing ev­ery­thing and get­ting noth­ing done. In­stead of re­sent­ing your ex­haust­ing slog into the city, it might start to feel re­ally pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>“Right now, we’re in an emer­gency, and the red lights are flash­ing,” said Mr Michael Co­la­cino, pres­i­dent of the of­fice real es­tate com­pany Square­Foot. “But when the lights are off, the ques­tion will still be: How do I get the en­gi­neer I want, or the</p>
    <p>Web de­signer I want? How do I in­duce them to come here? I can pay them more money, which is ex­pen­sive. Or I can give them more space, more feel­ing of safety, more ameni­ties.”</p>
    <p>All of these com­pa­nies cater­ing to the highly-skilled work force told me the same thing: Post-Covid-19, flex­i­bil­ity is go­ing to make the of­fice even better. Work­ers are go­ing to have a higher qual­ity of life, more time with their kids, more con­nec­tion to their com­mu­ni­ties. They’ll be able to live where they want to live, stop paying ex­or­bi­tant rent. They might even fig­ure out how to work less, sim­ply by be­ing able to con­cen­trate more. This is the wild, bliss­ful, utopian flex­i­ble fu­ture.</p>
    <p>But this is also a huge shift in the un­der­stand­ing of cor­po­rate flex­i­bil­ity – an ethos that was em­braced in the 1980s and 1990s. Back then, flex­i­bil­ity was for hir­ers, not em­ploy­ees. Cor­po­ra­tions wanted a work force that could be ex­panded and cut quickly, that wasn’t yoked to the firm through long-term con­tracts, faint ideas of loy­alty or union de­mands. In short, they wanted dis­pos­able work­ers in­stead of the long-term (or even lifer) em­ployee who had his­tor­i­cally weighed down the bot­tom line.</p>
    <p>The “flex­i­ble” ethos was sold to em­ploy­ees with the lan­guage of choice – it’s lib­er­at­ing to be a free­lancer or a con­trac­tor – even though it was of­ten “free­dom” to work more, for less pay, with far less sta­bil­ity. This made share­hold­ers happy but left com­pa­nies with a burned-out, less pro­duc­tive and ever more alien­ated work force.</p>
    <p>This was a prob­lem pre-pan­demic and it’s a big­ger prob­lem now. Which brings us to the bleak heart of the is­sue: A vast ma­jor­ity of peo­ple who were in “good” jobs – sta­ble, well paid, with ben­e­fits – be­fore the pan­demic have man­aged to keep those good jobs. Do­ing the job might have be­come more dif­fi­cult but the job it­self has largely re­mained steady.</p>
    <p>These em­ploy­ees are the ones whose bosses are go­ing to be seek­ing these so­lu­tions, who are think­ing of hir­ing heads of re­mote work, who are look­ing to even fur­ther “ameni­tise” their spa­ces, to fig­ure out new strate­gies to make work-life bal­ance real.</p>
    <p>For the rich and for the of­fice worker whose skills are in de­mand, the Covid-19 re­ces­sion has been over for months. With that sort of eco­nomic sta­bil­ity brings the abil­ity to in­no­vate and think about what “flex­i­ble” could mean mov­ing for­ward – in­clud­ing, hope­fully, new ways of think­ing about the cen­tral­ity of work in our lives. When you’re not com­pelled to be in the of­fice from 9 to 5, “flex­i­bil­ity means you ac­tu­ally sched­ule your day around your life”, as Mr Segel put it, “in­stead of around your work”.</p>
    <p>That sounds great. But ac­tual work-life bal­ance – the kind that comes with health­care and the abil­ity to some­day re­tire – should be for ev­ery­one, not just Web de­sign­ers and pro­gram­mers. The bar­gain­ing power that comes from some­thing as old-fash­ioned as a union or some­thing as seem­ingly rad­i­cal as Uni­ver­sal Ba­sic In­come would lib­er­ate work­ers to ask for more. Not more money, nec­es­sar­ily. But gen­uine flex­i­bil­ity to make work sec­ondary.</p>
    <p>If the fu­ture of work is flex­i­bil­ity, our chal­lenge now is to make sure that fu­ture doesn’t just worsen the ever-widen­ing di­vide in Amer­i­can so­ci­ety be­tween those promised a new vi­sion of the good, bal­anced life, and those for whom “flex­i­bil­ity” means ef­fac­ing your wants and needs and dreams, once again, to the fickle de­mands of your em­ployer.</p>
    <p>The “flex­i­ble” ethos was sold to em­ploy­ees with the lan­guage of choice – it’s lib­er­at­ing to be a free­lancer or a con­trac­tor – even though it was of­ten “free­dom” to work more, for less pay, with far less sta­bil­ity. This made share­hold­ers happy but left com­pa­nies with a burned-out, less pro­duc­tive and ever more alien­ated work force. This was a prob­lem pre-pan­demic and it’s a big­ger prob­lem now.</p>
