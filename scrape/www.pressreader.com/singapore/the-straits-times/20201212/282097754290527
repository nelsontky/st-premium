    <p>When I re­ceive calls from banks, tel­cos and trans­port ser­vice providers, the first thing they ask for is my NRIC num­ber to ver­ify my iden­tity (Clar­ify when firms need to col­lect NRIC num­ber, Dec 10).</p>
    <p>My im­me­di­ate re­ply to them is: You called me and not the other way round, you should ver­ify your iden­tity to me. In all cases, the caller was im­me­di­ately stumped.</p>
    <p>When I ex­plained that I had no idea if they were who they claimed to be, and asked them to tell me my NRIC num­ber in­stead, they would say that they were not al­lowed to di­vulge per­sonal de­tails. I would agree and sug­gest they state part of the num­ber in­stead, but so far all have de­clined.</p>
    <p>Some­times, I would feel com­fort­able enough to iden­tify my­self us­ing part of my NRIC num­ber af­ter the caller re­ferred to spe­cific de­tails of my case or com­plaint.</p>
    <p>In other cases, I was given a case num­ber and told to call the com­pany’s cus­tomer hot­line.</p>
    <p>Ei­ther way, such phone trans­ac­tions are rather clumsy, in­ef­fi­cient and/or not en­tirely se­cure.</p>
    <p>My ex­pe­ri­ences show that cus­tomer ser­vice of­fi­cers lack train­ing. And what is more dis­turb­ing is the pos­si­bil­ity of scam call­ers tak­ing ad­van­tage of this and trick­ing peo­ple with­out hav­ing to prove that they are who they say they are.</p>
    <p>We should make it a stan­dard re­quire­ment that any call ini­ti­ated by a busi­ness or or­gan­i­sa­tion must al­ways start with the caller ver­i­fy­ing his own iden­tity first. It amazes me that this sim­ple logic is not im­me­di­ately ap­par­ent.</p>
