    <p>SEOUL • North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was shown sur­rounded by pis­tol-tot­ing gen­er­als. In the South, masked vet­er­ans main­tained so­cial dis­tance, as the two sides yes­ter­day sep­a­rately marked the ar­mistice that ended Korean War hos­til­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The con­trast­ing events marked 67 years since the 1953 cease­fire that left the penin­sula di­vided and mil­lions of fam­i­lies split by the demil­i­tarised zone.</p>
    <p>In the North’s cap­i­tal yes­ter­day, Mr Kim handed out com­mem­o­ra­tive pis­tols to dozens of gen­er­als and of­fi­cers, who pledged their loy­alty to him, state me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>The North re­ported its first sus­pected case of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion at the week­end – af­ter in­sist­ing for months that it had kept it­self free of the dis­ease that has swept the world – but pic­tures showed the gen­er­als all gath­ered close to­gether for a group photo, none of them wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>Over in the South Korean cap­i­tal Seoul, scores of vet­er­ans – wear­ing masks and in so­cially dis­tanced seats – at­tended a tribute cer­e­mony, themed Days Of Glory.</p>
    <p>On screen, dra­matic re­con­struc­tions of the 1950-1953 war were in­ter­spersed with in­ter­views with foreign vet­er­ans, and mes­sages of sup­port from cur­rent lead­ers of the coun­tries that had sent troops to sup­port the South, among them US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his French coun­ter­part Em­manuel Macron.</p>
    <p>Mil­lions of peo­ple were killed dur­ing the three-year con­flict, which be­gan when the com­mu­nist North in­vaded the United Sates-backed South as leader Kim Il Sung – grand­fa­ther of Mr Kim Jong Un – sought to re­unify by force the penin­sula that Moscow and Wash­ing­ton had di­vided at the end of World War II.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese- and Soviet-backed</p>
    <p>North fought to a stand­still against the South and a US-led United Na­tions coali­tion.</p>
    <p>The hos­til­i­ties ended on July 27, 1953, with a cease­fire that has never been re­placed by a peace treaty, which means the two sides are tech­ni­cally still at war.</p>
    <p>The North has built up a nu­clear arse­nal that it says it needs to pro­tect it­self against a US in­va­sion, and has been sub­jected to mul­ti­ple in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Py­ongyang re­gards the con­flict as a vic­tory, and the an­niver­sary is a pub­lic hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>The North’s of­fi­cial news agency KCNA re­ported that the com­mem­o­ra­tive pis­tols were named af­ter Mount Paektu, the dor­mant vol­cano on the Chi­nese-Korean border that is re­garded as the spir­i­tual birth­place of the Korean peo­ple. The pis­tol also car­ried Mr Kim Jong Un’s name as a to­ken of his trust in the mil­i­tary com­man­ders.</p>
    <p>At an­other South­ern cer­e­mony in Pan­munjom, the truce vil­lage in the demil­i­tarised zone, Gen­eral Robert Abrams, the com­man­der of UN Com­mand and US Forces Korea, noted the stark de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in con­di­tions on the penin­sula.</p>
    <p>Seoul-Py­ongyang ties have wors­ened steadily, and last month the North blew up a li­ai­son of­fice on its side of the border.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, “there was an air of cau­tious op­ti­mism as the world wit­nessed a sig­nif­i­cant and pal­pa­ble re­duc­tion of ten­sions be­tween North and South Korea”, Gen Abrams told a hand­ful of uni­formed of­fi­cers and diplo­mats in masks.</p>
    <p>“To­day, this cau­tious op­ti­mism has shifted some­what to an air of un­cer­tainty,” he said.</p>
    <p>The US sta­tions 28,500 troops in the South to de­fend its in­ter­ests and pro­tect it from its neigh­bour.</p>
