    <p>My po­lit­i­cal awak­en­ing hap­pened when I was in sec­ondary school in the 1950s. I be­came aware that there was a world­wide move­ment of peo­ple liv­ing un­der colo­nial rule and these peo­ple were rising up against their colo­nial masters. They wanted self-de­ter­mi­na­tion and independen­ce.</p>
    <p>The strug­gle by In­dia against the Bri­tish rule caught my imag­i­na­tion and sup­port. There were two heroic fig­ures in that strug­gle. They were Ma­hatma Gandhi and Pan­dit Jawa­har­lal Nehru.</p>
    <p>Gandhi’s re­jec­tion of vi­o­lence and his use of civil dis­obe­di­ence as a weapon against the Bri­tish were con­trar­ian and as­ton­ish­ing to a young stu­dent. Gandhi’s vic­tory in gain­ing independen­ce for In­dia in 1947 seemed like a mir­a­cle.</p>
    <p>When Gandhi was as­sas­si­nated on Jan 30, 1948, many of us cried.</p>
    <p>I am, there­fore, shocked that there is a move­ment in In­dia to glo­rify Gandhi’s as­sas­sin, Nathu­ram Vi­nayak Godse. Some­thing must be se­ri­ously wrong in In­dia if the as­sas­sin of its na­tional hero is be­ing glo­ri­fied in­stead of be­ing vil­i­fied.</p>
    <p>What is the In­dia of my dreams? First, I dream of an In­dia which is sec­u­lar. By this, I mean that the In­dian state has no re­li­gion and all In­di­ans have the con­sti­tu­tional right to choose their own re­li­gions.</p>
    <p>Hin­dus, Sikhs, Jains, Bud­dhists, Mus­lims, Chris­tians, Zoroas­tri­ans, Jews, Ba­hais and athe­ists would live har­mo­niously with one another. The Hin­dus, who form the ma­jor­ity, would re­spect the other faiths and would not per­se­cute any re­li­gious mi­nor­ity. In­dia could be an ex­am­ple to the world of re­li­gious di­ver­sity and re­li­gious har­mony.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, I dream of an In­dia which is a strong and vi­brant democ­racy. In­dia has a pop­u­la­tion of 1.339 bil­lion peo­ple. It will soon be the most pop­u­lous coun­try in the world.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple say that China can­not be­come a democ­racy be­cause it is too big. Those who make this ar­gu­ment have ob­vi­ously for­got­ten the case of In­dia.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess of the In­dian democ­racy is par­tic­u­larly im­pres­sive as the coun­try is cul­tur­ally and lin­guis­ti­cally di­verse.</p>
    <p>It is, of course, true that the In­dian democ­racy is not with­out its flaws. But it is im­pres­sive that a coun­try with such a big pop­u­la­tion could go reg­u­larly to the polls to elect a gov­ern­ment of its choice. Tran­si­tions of power take place peace­fully. I dream of a day when vote-buy­ing, cor­rupt politi­cians and crim­i­nal politi­cians and other ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties will be a thing of the past.</p>
    <p>Third, I dream of an In­dia which is ad­mired for its strong ad­her­ence to the rule of the law.</p>
    <p>The rule of law is one of hu­mankind’s most pre­cious achieve­ments. What it means is that no one is above the law and ev­ery­one is sub­ject to the law. It means that the po­lice­man, the pros­e­cu­tor and the judge can­not be bought. In other words, jus­tice is not for sale. It also means that the ju­di­ciary is in­de­pen­dent of the ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>In the World Jus­tice Project’s Rule of Law In­dex 2019, In­dia ranked 68 out of 126 coun­tries. One of the rea­sons for In­dia’s low rank­ing is ju­di­cial de­lay.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, it can take years for an ag­grieved per­son to ob­tain jus­tice through its courts. There are</p>
    <p>4.3 mil­lion cases pend­ing in the coun­try’s high courts, with 800,000 be­ing over 10 years old. Another prob­lem is the abuse of the le­gal sys­tem by un­scrupu­lous per­sons as a means to ex­tort money from per­sons they have sued. I dream of the day when In­dia will be ranked among the top 10 coun­tries of the world for the rule of law.</p>
    <p>Fourth, I dream of an In­dia in which girls and women will en­joy equal rights with boys and men.</p>
    <p>In the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum’s Global Gen­der Gap In­dex, In­dia is ranked 112 out of 153 coun­tries. In the United Na­tions Devel­op­ment Pro­gramme’s Gen­der In­equal­ity In­dex, In­dia is ranked 135 out of 187 coun­tries. The fe­male lit­er­acy rate in In­dia is 60.6 per cent com­pared to 81.3 per cent for men. The rates of mal­nu­tri­tion are ex­cep­tion­ally high for ado­les­cent girls and preg­nant and lac­tat­ing women. Vi­o­lence against women, es­pe­cially sex­ual vi­o­lence, has been on the rise.</p>
    <p>I dream of an In­dia in which no per­son, no mat­ter what caste he or she be­longs to, will be dis­crim­i­nated against. I dream of a day in which the rights en­shrined in the Univer­sal Dec­la­ra­tion of Hu­man Rights and in the two covenants will be en­joyed by all In­di­ans, ir­re­spec­tive of race, re­li­gion, gen­der and caste.</p>
    <p>Fifth, I dream of an In­dia in which the ab­ject poverty we see to­day will no longer ex­ist. Ac­cord­ing to the In­dian gov­ern­ment, 29.8 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion lives be­low the poverty line. This means about 360 mil­lion peo­ple. This is based upon a poverty line fixed at US$0.65 (S$0.87) a day. The World Bank draws the poverty line at US$2 a day.</p>
    <p>What­ever the fig­ure, the num­ber of poor peo­ple in In­dia is shock­ingly high. Who are the poor peo­ple? They are farm work­ers in vil­lages, ca­sual work­ers in cities, the tribal peo­ple, the Dal­its or Un­touch­ables and the Mus­lims.</p>
    <p>To re­duce poverty in In­dia, we need the In­dian econ­omy to grow at a much faster rate than the present. We also need a fairer dis­tri­bu­tion of the fruits of eco­nomic progress. We need In­dian lead­ers who will make the re­duc­tion of poverty a na­tional pri­or­ity, not in words but in deeds.</p>
    <p>Sixth, I dream of an In­dia whose econ­omy is on a par with that of China. The two coun­tries have pop­u­la­tions of ap­prox­i­mately the same size. How­ever, in 2019, the Chi­nese econ­omy was 4.78 times big­ger than that of In­dia. In­dia has been grossly un­der-per­form­ing.</p>
    <p>In or­der to catch up with China, In­dia has to raise its an­nual rate of growth to be­tween 8 and 10 per cent and main­tain it at that level for two to three decades. Can it be done? The an­swer is yes if the gov­ern­ment and peo­ple of In­dia have a shared po­lit­i­cal will to ac­com­plish that am­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>Sev­enth, I dream of an In­dia which is high for good gov­er­nance and low for cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>In Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional’s Cor­rup­tion Per­cep­tion In­dex for 2019, In­dia was ranked 80 out of 179 coun­tries. Cor­rup­tion is a se­ri­ous prob­lem in In­dia. At present, In­dia is ranked high for cor­rup­tion and low for good gov­er­nance. I would like to see that re­versed.</p>
    <p>Eighth, I dream of an In­dia which is ad­mired for its soft power.</p>
    <p>In­dia has a rich and an­cient civil­i­sa­tion. Hin­duism, Bud­dhism, Sikhism and Jain­ism are four of the world’s great re­li­gions. In­dia is renowned for its Bol­ly­wood movies and its cricket stars. Gandhi, Nehru, Rabindrana­th Tagore and Amartya Sen are world icons.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in spite of these as­sets, In­dia’s soft power to­day is weak. In the 2019 Soft Power 30, In­dia is not in­cluded in the top 30 coun­tries for soft power. I have asked the au­thor of the in­dex why In­dia is not in­cluded. He said that there were too many neg­a­tives about In­dia, for ex­am­ple, poverty and in­equal­ity, op­pres­sion of women and other mi­nori­ties, pol­luted cities, poor state of ed­u­ca­tion and pub­lic health, etc.</p>
    <p>The In­dia of my dreams is a sec­u­lar In­dia and a model of re­li­gious di­ver­sity and har­mony. It is a vi­brant democ­racy with a strong ad­her­ence to the rule of law. It pro­tects the rights of girls, women, Dal­its, the tribal peo­ple and other mi­nori­ties. In­dia will have caught up with China eco­nom­i­cally. Poverty will be re­duced to be­low 10 per cent. In­dia’s soft power will be ad­mired by the world. I hope that the In­dia of my dreams will, one day, be­come a re­al­ity.</p>
