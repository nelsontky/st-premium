    <p>A do­mes­tic helper hit her em­ployer’s one-month-old baby three times on his back to “vent her stress”.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian Lana Ngizatul Mona, 26, was caught af­ter the in­fant’s mother viewed closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion (CCTV) footage of the in­ci­dent. The baby boy suf­fered a bruise on his right shoul­der as a re­sult of the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Lana was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to nine months’ jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to one count of ill-treat­ing the baby, who can­not be named ow­ing to a gag or­der.</p>
    <p>The child’s mother had em­ployed Lana, who started work­ing at the woman’s flat near Hougang on Feb 26.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Tan Pei Wei told the court that the maid was tasked to care for her em­ployer’s four chil­dren and per­form gen­eral house­hold chores.</p>
    <p>The mother was in her bed­room around 7.30am on April 30 when she heard the baby cry­ing loudly in the liv­ing room. She checked the CCTV footage and saw Lana hit­ting her son’s back three times.</p>
    <p>The DPP added: “In the CCTV footage, the ac­cused is seen hit­ting the vic­tim on the back with her wrist. The vic­tim cried im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused was next seen hit­ting the vic­tim on the back with her fist twice, caus­ing the vic­tim to cry again. All three blows were force­ful and had audi­ble im­pact.”</p>
    <p>Lana later told in­ves­ti­ga­tors that she had hit the in­fant due to stress.</p>
    <p>Her em­ployer alerted the po­lice that morn­ing and the child was taken to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>DPP Tan yes­ter­day urged District Judge Salina Ishak to sen­tence Lana to at least nine months’ jail.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tor said: “The vic­tim was only one month old at the ma­te­rial time and was ab­so­lutely de­fence­less against the of­fender.</p>
    <p>“He was un­able to run away from the of­fender and his only means of ex­press­ing his dis­tress at her blows was to cry.”</p>
    <p>For ill-treat­ing a child, an of­fender can be jailed for up to eight years and fined up to $8,000.</p>
