    <p>Heav­ily preg­nant Katy Perry is about to pop any time, but she has an­other “baby” on the way in the form of her sixth stu­dio al­bum, which will drop on Aug 28.</p>
    <p>While a Katy Perry al­bum is typ­i­cally chock-full of bright and shiny pop tunes, she re­vealed that her lat­est, Smile, was borne of a par­tic­u­larly dark time in her life .</p>
    <p>“It’s called Smile be­cause I walked through hell to get my smile back when I lost it in 2017 and 2018, so I started writ­ing songs when I was com­ing out of a re­ally dark time when I was su­per de­pressed,” con­fessed the 35-year-old, who was speak­ing to re­gional me­dia over a Zoom call from her Cal­i­for­nia home yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Clad in a bub­blegum-pink off­shoul­der dress and tur­ban, her ef­fer­ves­cent pres­ence be­lies the dark­ness she delved into when mak­ing the record.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view on The Howard Stern Show last month, she re­vealed that her de­pres­sion stemmed from the dis­ap­point­ing re­lease of her 2017 al­bum Wit­ness, which she said “didn’t nec­es­sar­ily meet my ex­pec­ta­tions”.</p>
    <p>Part of com­ing into her own meant “jump­ing off the rat race of be­ing the best pop star ever”.</p>
    <p>“I let go of this in­tense com­pe­ti­tion part of it be­cause it be­came un­healthy and it’s what made me spi­ral in 2017. In let­ting go of that, I opened my­self up to di­men­sions as a hu­man and as a woman,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I’m not on this con­stant tread­mill of try­ing to be the best pop star ever. Now I just want to be the best hu­man ever, the best mum, part­ner, sis­ter, daugh­ter. I want to do all that!”</p>
    <p>The songs on Smile were writ­ten in the last two years, as she emerged from the haze of de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>“I started telling my­self... to keep on danc­ing through those teary eyes – I am re­silient, gotta get back that smile. These were lit­tle ti­tles and mantras and they be­came songs,” she said.</p>
    <p>The re­sult is a record that cen­tres around “thought­ful­ness, hope, re­silience and joy”.</p>
    <p>“It’s a raw record even though it’s up­beat, and what­ever I can do to shed a lit­tle light in this dark mo­ment, I’ll do it,” she added.</p>
    <p>“Mu­sic has al­ways been there for me in my dark­est times, espe­cially when I was younger. When I was so over­whelmed with emo­tions and didn’t know how to or­gan­ise them, if I turned on the right song, I felt un­der­stood, I felt seen.”</p>
    <p>Her fans can rest as­sured that the al­bum is still “pure pop” and son­i­cally more in the style of Prism (2013) and Teenage Dream (2010). All the songs are up­beat ex­cept for the al­bum closer, the mid-tempo What Makes A Woman.</p>
    <p>Smile is also par­tic­u­larly timely in these dark times, but pan­demic or not, Perry feels “hope is al­ways in style”.</p>
    <p>“My hope is that I can just put the record out and speak can­didly about my own ex­pe­ri­ence so that some­one can iden­tify with it... I can only lead by ex­am­ple.”</p>
    <p>An­other big rea­son she has found her smile again: She is ex­pect­ing her first child with fi­ance, English ac­tor Or­lando Bloom of Lord Of The Rings and Pi­rates Of The Caribbean fame.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Howard Stern in­ter­view, Perry said Bloom was in­stru­men­tal in get­ting her through her dark pe­riod and that he is per­fect for her.</p>
    <p>She also has his nine-year-old son Flynn – from his pre­vi­ous mar­riage to model Mi­randa Kerr – to thank for pick­ing out the first sin­gle from Smile, re­leased in May last year.</p>
    <p>“He loves mu­sic and Tik­Tok and knows what’s go­ing on in the world, so I played him three songs last year and asked him which one to put out first. He chose Never Re­ally Over,” she said, adding that he was one of the first to lis­ten to songs from the record.</p>
    <p>Due to give birth this month, she ad­mit­ted she had not planned on putting out an al­bum con­cur­rently.</p>
    <p>“But 2020 is about throw­ing plans up in the air,” she quipped.</p>
    <p>But moth­er­hood has also gifted her a new per­spec­tive that has strength­ened her re­solve both per­son­ally and pro­fes­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>“The needs of a new­born and pre­par­ing to bring a life that is so vul­ner­a­ble and del­i­cate (into the world) are way be­yond what I imag­ined,” she said.</p>
    <p>A United Na­tions Chil­dren’s Fund Good­will Am­bas­sador since 2013, her fo­cus has been on chil­dren and ado­les­cents who are most vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a child, Perry added, “blows my mind and gives me this fire in my belly, which I think will trans­late into be­ing ac­tive in sup­port­ing and stand­ing up for chil­dren, moth­ers and women”.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways had this sense of want­ing jus­tice to pre­vail, and as I turn into mama bear, it’s go­ing to get even bolder,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I’m ex­cited to take that new­found fire and ap­ply it in all as­pects of my life – even in song­writ­ing and in be­ing un­afraid to tell the sto­ries, whether they’re pretty or not.”</p>
    <p>She wants it to be okay to talk about real life, even if she is a pop star.</p>
    <p>“There’s some hu­man­ity, and stigma taken off, when peo­ple talk about the hard times. Life isn’t a per­fect In­sta­gram post, it’s all of the things.”</p>
    <p>I’m not on this con­stant tread­mill of try­ing to be the best pop star ever. Now I just want to be the best hu­man ever, the best mum, part­ner, sis­ter, daugh­ter. I want ’’ to do all that!</p>
