    <p>UNITED NA­TIONS • Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping told the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly yes­ter­day that Bei­jing has “no in­ten­tion to fight ei­ther a Cold War or a hot one with any coun­try”, as ten­sions grow be­tween China and the US.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to nar­row dif­fer­ences and re­solve dis­putes with oth­ers through di­a­logue and ne­go­ti­a­tion. We will not seek to de­velop only our­selves or en­gage in a zero-sum game,” he said in a pre-recorded video state­ment to the an­nual gath­er­ing of world lead­ers, con­ducted vir­tu­ally this year due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There has been talk in re­cent months about the pos­si­bil­ity of Bei­jing getting dragged into an armed con­flict with Wash­ing­ton. The South China Sea ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes are seen as the like­li­est trig­ger for any scuf­fle.</p>
    <p>Long-sim­mer­ing ten­sions be­tween the United States and China also hit boil­ing point over the han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic, spot­light­ing Bei­jing’s bid for greater mul­ti­lat­eral in­flu­ence in a chal­lenge to Wash­ing­ton’s tra­di­tional lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus was first de­tected in China late last year and Wash­ing­ton ac­cuses Bei­jing of a lack of trans­parency that it says wors­ened the out­break.</p>
    <p>In what ap­peared to be a re­buke to US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, though both lead­ers’ speeches were pre-recorded, Mr Xi called for a global re­sponse to the virus and giv­ing the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) a lead­ing role. “Fac­ing the virus, we should en­hance sol­i­dar­ity and get through this to­gether. We should fol­low the guid­ance of sci­ence, give full play to the lead­ing role of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion,” Mr Xi said. “Any at­tempt of politi­cis­ing the is­sue or stig­ma­ti­sa­tion must be re­jected.”</p>
    <p>He also warned against the per­ils of a “clash of civil­i­sa­tions” dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier speech on Mon­day at a meet­ing to mark the world body’s 75th an­niver­sary, Mr Xi took a veiled swipe at the US in a strongly worded ad­dress, say­ing no coun­try should “be al­lowed to do what­ever it likes and be the hege­mon, bully or boss of the world”.</p>
    <p>Push­ing for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries to have a greater role in world af­fairs, Mr Xi said the UN could be “more bal­anced” and urged “in­ter­na­tional or­der un­der­pinned by in­ter­na­tional law”, the of­fi­cial Xin­hua news agency reported.</p>
