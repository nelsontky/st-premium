        Invest | The Sunday Times Sunday, August 2, 2020 | B12 ST ILLUSTRATI­ON: CEL GUL APA How to prepare for a retrenchme­nt The stress of uncertaint­y may prompt fantasies about beating your company to the punch and quitting. Don’t do it! And don’t accept a company’s offer to let you resign rather than be let go.
“A lot of people think that if they resign, it looks like they’ve been in the driver’s seat,” Mr Cohen said, adding: “But in this market, where getting fired is the norm, explaining to future employers that you chose to resign will sound very odd and quite frankly raise questions about your credibilit­y.”
Copy your contacts. Among many workers’ most valuable assets are the contacts they have built up over the years. If you don’t already have current informatio­n for business contacts stored in a file on your phone or personal computer, start the process.
Copy any samples of work a future employer might want to see, while being careful not to run afoul of non-compete clauses and company policies governing proprietar­y data.
Sniff out severance. Try to find your company’s terminatio­n and severance policy. Dig up your letter of employment or contract to see if it mentions severance. If it doesn’t, quietly ask around and look on a site like Glassdoor.com to see if it’s to your industry that you may be able to join.
Perfect your video presence. Practise using Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts or whatever video conferenci­ng program an interviewe­r might choose. Record yourself in a mock interview with a friend. Use a neutral background, wear solid colours, and remember to silence your phone and computer pop-ups.
Beware of being called back early from work abroad. The typical industry practice is that employees working abroad are repatriate­d before they know that their job will be terminated, said Ms Katrin Razzano, a vice-president at relocation firm Graebel Companies. That way, the person can be fired on home turf and a company won’t run afoul of a foreign country’s rules around laying people off.
Search out bright spots. There are always growing areas, even in dire economic situations. In Singapore, the fintech sector has been growing quickly, even amid the coronaviru­s pandemic, and an expansion by global private banks in Singapore has intensifie­d rivalry for talent, according to Bloomberg Intelligen­ce analysts. Also, interest from Hong Kong-based companies in exploring a move to Singapore has increased. mentioned in company reviews. In the United States, for businesses that offer severance, the norm is one or two weeks of pay for each year of employment, maxing out at about six months, though executives may get a year.
If you work at a large company, check if there’s a group for former employees on Facebook. You may be able to message its members for informatio­n.
Your company may not budge, but try to negotiate. “Ask for everything and more,” Mr Cohen said. “More money. Your bonus. The ability to exercise stock options or receive differed compensati­on. Access to your work phone during the severance period. The worst they can do is say no.”
Raise your profile. Yes, this means updating your resume and LinkedIn profile. Highlight your success in working remotely. But before polishing a LinkedIn profile, go into privacy settings and turn off automatic notificati­ons to your network if you want to keep the changes low-profile.
If you don’t want someone at work to see profile updates, you can block specific people.
If you think a layoff is coming and want to look for a new job discreetly, a feature LinkedIn added this year allows you to adjust your status to “#OpentoWork” and to specify who can see that: only recruiters, or everyone.
Build up savings, pay down debt. Having a few months of expenses saved can avoid the need to take on expensive credit-card debt or skipping payments and hurting your credit score in the process.
Aim to save six months or more of living expenses. That sounds high, but remember, that’s not necessaril­y six full pay cheques. You want enough to cover essentials: housing, car payments, utilities, Internet, mobile phones, healthcare.
While employed, get in touch with former colleagues who have moved to consulting or project work, and if you’re let go, consider going that route, which could eventually lead to a full-time job.
One bright spot is that with remote work more common, more employers are willing to look farther afield for candidates. To spark ideas for new directions, check out the site 50 Ways To Get A Job.
Be a creative networker. Finding groups on Facebook and LinkedIn is the first step, but look into what’s offered by your university’s career office, profession­al groups you belong to and ask around for private Facebook communitie­s connected Act surprised, even if you aren’t. And make them feel awful.
That’s the first thing you should do if your boss says you’re being laid off, said Mr Roy Cohen, who runs his own career consulting business. “Always convey utter, absolute shock,” he said.
“The goal is to make them feel bad. That way, if you do want to try and negotiate a better package, there is some potential they may feel guilty in some way.”
An avalanche of layoffs has been moving across the global corporate landscape, in almost every industry, as firms assess their long-term strategy in a post-pandemic world.
Prepping yourself to play head games is one strategy to try if you worry your job might be next. But there are many more practical steps to take. Being laid off will still suck, but it will hurt less if you’ve put plans into motion.
Resist the pre-emptive strike. SEIZE THE INITIATIVE Always convey utter, absolute shock. The goal is to make them feel bad. That way, if you do want to try and negotiate a better package, there is some potential they may feel guilty in some way. ’’ MR ROY COHEN, who runs his own career consulting business.
