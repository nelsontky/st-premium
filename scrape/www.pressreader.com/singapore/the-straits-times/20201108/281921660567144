    <p>Great Eastern fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tive Syafiq Shah, 26, shares what he’s gained from a ca­reer in fi­nan­cial plan­ning.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Mr Shah grad­u­ated from the Univer­sity of Wol­lon­gong with a de­gree in com­merce (fi­nance), he un­der­went a four-month in­tern­ship in re­tail op­er­a­tions at a bank .</p>
    <p>The “typ­i­cal cor­po­rate of­fice en­vi­ron­ment” left much to be de­sired, and led to him choos­ing a ca­reer in fi­nan­cial plan­ning in­stead.</p>
    <p>“What I want out of my ca­reer is to be able to work as hard as I can and achieve work-life bal­ance at the same time.</p>
    <p>“I love the fact that I am able to make my own sched­ule for the day. With this job, I al­ways feel pos­i­tive and happy when wak­ing up in the morn­ing for work.”</p>
    <p>The job sat­is­fac­tion has led to suc­cess. Within just four months of be­ing a fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tive, he re­ceived the Mil­lion Dol­lar Round Ta­ble (MDRT) As­pi­rant Award.</p>
    <p>The MDRT is a global trade as­so­ci­a­tion that recog­nises top-per­form­ing fi­nan­cial ser­vices pro­fes­sion­als around the world.</p>
    <p>In­surance is a mean­ing­ful ca­reer to pur­sue and grow in, to sup­port peo­ple’s pro­tec­tion needs with pro­fes­sional ad­vice and as­sis­tance through­out their dif­fer­ent life stages.</p>
    <p>Mr Shah shares he has seen fam­i­lies and re­la­tion­ships sour due to money is­sues and a lack of plan­ning.</p>
    <p>With this ex­pe­ri­ence, he hopes to help peo­ple in­sure them­selves against un­fore­seen events and ac­ci­dents — es­pe­cially amid the un­cer­tain­ties from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I want to reach out to peo­ple and make an im­pact on their lives by ed­u­cat­ing and em­pow­er­ing them with fi­nan­cial plan­ning, so that they can proac­tively take steps to ad­e­quately pro­tect their fi­nan­cial well-be­ing through­out their lives.”</p>
    <p>It has only been a year since Mr Shah be­came a fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tive, but he al­ready sees him­self stay­ing put for the long haul.</p>
    <p>He says that reg­u­lar train­ing cour­ses of­fered to fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tives to up­date their skills make him feel more se­cure and as­sured about his fu­ture in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“The best part of the job for me is be­ing part of my clients’ key life stages, and the op­por­tu­ni­ties for life­long learn­ing en­cour­age me to push my­self and think dif­fer­ently all the time.”</p>
