    <p>Have you ever heard of a head of re­mote work­ing?</p>
    <p>No? Join the club. Mil­lions may have been work­ing from home since March and bosses may be talk­ing of a per­ma­nent shift to “hy­brid” work­ing, where some staff stay at home while oth­ers go to the of­fice and most do a bit of both.</p>
    <p>But the job of over­see­ing every­thing a far-flung work­force needs, from de­cent chairs to smarter ways of stay­ing in touch, is typ­i­cally be­ing done by the same ex­ec­u­tives who were there pre-pan­demic – on top of their day jobs.</p>
    <p>A hand­ful of com­pa­nies, mostly tech groups, have cre­ated a head of re­mote role.</p>
    <p>Most have not, which un­der­lines an un­set­tling truth about Covid-19: it may have up­ended the world of work but the ba­sic struc­tures of the work­ing world have barely budged.</p>
    <p>This may be about to mat­ter more.</p>
    <p>As JPMor­gan Chase found last week, when it had to send some work­ers home af­ter one tested pos­i­tive, get­ting peo­ple back to the of­fice is tough. But stay­ing home has prob­lems too. A lot of lead­ers are nat­u­rally eye­ing hy­brid work­ing. How are they likely to fare?</p>
    <p>Hor­ri­bly, ac­cord­ing to Mr Sid Si­jbrandij, a 41-year-old Dutch tech boss who has be­come some­thing of a re­mote work celebrity dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I think most com­pa­nies are not go­ing to pull it off,” he told me last week from San Fran­cisco where he runs GitLab, a soft­ware de­vel­op­ment com­pany with a work-from-any­where pol­icy that is ex­treme even for Sil­i­con Val­ley.</p>
    <p>Born in 2011 and backed by Gold­man Sachs, GitLab has more than 1,300 staff in 67 coun­tries. They all work re­motely, as does Mr Si­jbrandij, the group’s chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder.</p>
    <p>He thinks com­pa­nies will strug­gle with hy­brid work­ing be­cause re­mote work­ing alone re­quires ef­fort and prac­tices that he ad­mits are “not nat­u­ral”.</p>
    <p>GitLab, for ex­am­ple, goes to great lengths to repli­cate the in­for­mal chats and meet­ings that hap­pen nor­mally in an of­fice. Staff are urged to de­vote a few hours a week to so­cial calls: “cof­fee chats” with any other em­ployee, or “juice chats” with fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>There are also rules on meet­ings. Half-hour ones should last only 25 min­utes and hour-long ones should end at 50 min­utes, so peo­ple can blather or re­cover in-be­tween.</p>
    <p>There are more rules for how to com­mu­ni­cate. Zoom is for call­ing. Slack is for chat­ting, and so on. “We’re pre­scrip­tive about what peo­ple should use,” says Mr Si­jbrandij. “We’re not like, ‘Use what­ever you want’.”</p>
    <p>Every­thing is set out in a mam­moth on­line hand­book that peo­ple are sup­posed to con­sult.</p>
    <p>You can take a quiz to test your grasp of it all.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has, of course, had a head of re­mote since July last year, long be­fore Covid-19 was even a cross­word clue.</p>
    <p>The point of all this is that it is hard to make re­mote work­ing work and Mr Si­jbrandij thinks that try­ing to do it on top of man­ag­ing work­ers in the of­fice is ask­ing for trou­ble.</p>
    <p>“I think it will kind of be a de­graded ex­pe­ri­ence for both the re­mote peo­ple and the peo­ple at the of­fice, but I think it will be worse for the re­mote peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>One big rea­son: most lead­ers will go back to the of­fice. Over time, no mat­ter how much they in­sist they sup­port peo­ple at home, ev­ery­one will know that to get ahead, you should be in the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Some data backs this up. One study of re­mote work­ing in a Chi­nese travel agency showed staff at home were more pro­duc­tive and hap­pier, but less likely to be pro­moted.</p>
    <p>Mr Si­jbrandij thinks any boss who brings in hy­brid work­ing should stay at home, be­cause re­mote work­ers will be most dis­ad­van­taged.</p>
    <p>I can­not see that work­ing for ev­ery busi­ness, but it does make sense for many. So does one of his top tips for any leader in the un­en­vi­able po­si­tion of try­ing to fig­ure out what to do next: be very care­ful about shift­ing to a hy­brid model. Once you do it, it’s a one-way street.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple will move state or coun­try. If you want them back, good luck. For some com­pa­nies, it might be bet­ter to get ev­ery­one back in the of­fice. Ei­ther way, it is a big de­ci­sion that should not be taken lightly. Hav­ing a head of re­mote might be a se­ri­ous help.</p>
