    <p>If all goes well, if we can con­tinue to main­tain this level of com­pli­ance and we can con­tinue to con­trol the in­fec­tion well, then we will be able to con­tinue with this path of re­sum­ing and open­ing up our econ­omy and our so­ci­ety steadily. We are al­ready work­ing out the road map to­wards phase three. We have some plans on how this can be done over the sub­se­quent weeks, and when we are ready, we will share these plans with Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>More ac­tiv­i­ties will re­sume in the com­ing weeks and busi­nesses will be able to run their op­er­a­tions more smoothly since Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to keep the num­ber of Covid-19 cases in the com­mu­nity rel­a­tively low, said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In the most sig­nif­i­cant eas­ing of re­stric­tions at work­places since the cir­cuit breaker was im­posed in April, more em­ploy­ees will be al­lowed to re­turn to the of­fice from next Mon­day. How­ever, safe man­age­ment mea­sures must be in place and em­ploy­ers should en­sure flex­i­ble work­ing hours and stag­gered re­port­ing times.</p>
    <p>Also, em­ploy­ees must con­tinue to work from home for at least half their work­ing hours as work­ing from home is still the de­fault op­tion.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers must also en­sure that no more than half of the em­ploy­ees who are able to work from home are in the of­fice at any point in time.</p>
    <p>In an­other move to help busi­nesses, es­sen­tial busi­ness travel will be per­mit­ted for se­nior ex­ec­u­tives with ex­ten­sive re­gional or in­ter­na­tional re­spon­si­bil­i­ties through a new pi­lot scheme.</p>
    <p>Un­der the trial, a lim­ited num­ber of passes will be given out through Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic agen­cies, and those who travel will have to abide by a “strict, con­trolled itin­er­ary”. When they re­turn, trav­ellers will be given the op­tion of do­ing a Covid-19 test in­stead of serv­ing a stay-home no­tice, and self-iso­lat­ing un­til the test re­sults are out.</p>
    <p>Events within the work­place, such as sem­i­nars, cor­po­rate re­treats and an­nual gen­eral meet­ings, will also be al­lowed to re­sume as long as safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures are in place. How­ever, work-re­lated events at ex­ter­nal venues re­main pro­hib­ited for now.</p>
    <p>These up­dated re­quire­ments for safe man­age­ment mea­sures at the work­place will take ef­fect next Mon­day. The Health Min­istry said the up­date bal­ances the im­pact of work­ing from home on pro­duc­tiv­ity, while cre­at­ing a safe en­vi­ron­ment for em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a press con­fer­ence by the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the pan­demic, Mr Gan also an­nounced the eas­ing of safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures for re­li­gious ser­vices, mar­riage solem­ni­sa­tions, and wed­ding re­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>From Oct 3, all re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions will be al­lowed to hold con­gre­ga­tional and other wor­ship ser­vices for up to 100 peo­ple, as long as safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures are in place.</p>
    <p>For wed­ding re­cep­tions, up to 100 guests – in­clud­ing the wed­ding cou­ple, but ex­clud­ing ven­dors and ser­vice providers – will be al­lowed. They should be split into groups of no more than 50 peo­ple, or at­tend the wed­ding at sep­a­rate time slots. There should be at least 30 min­utes be­tween slots for clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion of the event space.</p>
    <p>The cap for mar­riage solem­ni­sa­tions will also be in­creased to 100 peo­ple split across mul­ti­ple zones of up to 50 peo­ple each.</p>
    <p>How­ever, venue op­er­a­tors may im­pose a lower cap if they are un­able to com­ply with the zon­ing or stag­gered tim­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said voluntary Covid-19 test­ing of taxi and pri­vate-hire car driv­ers has also started, with more than 10,000 tested over the past two weeks. Around 750 stall­hold­ers and food de­liv­ery per­son­nel were also tested over the week­end. No pos­i­tive cases have been re­ported in these groups so far, he added.</p>
    <p>“This is a good sign as it in­di­cates very low preva­lence in our com­mu­nity,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is also an in­di­ca­tion that our safe dis­tanc­ing and safe man­age­ment mea­sures, cou­pled with the use of face masks and height­ened vig­i­lance on ev­ery­one’s part, are pow­er­ful and ef­fec­tive weapons in our fight against Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the task force with Mr Gan, said the Government is al­ready work­ing on a road map for the third and fi­nal phase of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>“We have some plans on how this can be done over the sub­se­quent weeks, and when we are ready, we will share these plans with Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he said.</p>
