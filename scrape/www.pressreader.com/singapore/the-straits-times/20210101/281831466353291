    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United States has called for the re­lease of a Uighur Mus­lim med­i­cal doc­tor who rel­a­tives say was sen­tenced to 20 years’ jail in China be­cause of her fam­ily mem­bers’ hu­man rights ac­tivism in the US.</p>
    <p>The daugh­ter of Dr Gul­shan Ab­bas told a brief­ing on Wed­nes­day, or­gan­ised with the bi­par­ti­san US Con­gres­sional-Ex­ec­u­tive Com­mis­sion on China, that the fam­ily re­cently learnt of her mother’s sen­tenc­ing in March 2019 on ter­ror­ism-re­lated charges. She had dis­ap­peared in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>The daugh­ter, Ms Ziba Mu­rat, called the charges “pre­pos­ter­ous”.</p>
    <p>Dr Gul­shan’s sis­ter, Ms Rushan Ab­bas, said the charges stemmed from ac­tivism by her and her brother, Mr Rishat Ab­bas, both of whom are based in the United States.</p>
    <p>“We have com­mit­ted to work­ing to de­fend our peo­ple’s rights and ad­vo­cate for jus­tice, and now our sis­ter is de­nied jus­tice as a pun­ish­ment,” Ms Rushan said.</p>
    <p>In a post on Twit­ter, US As­sis­tant Sec­re­tary of State for Democ­racy, Hu­man Rights and Labour Robert De­stro said Dr Gul­shan must be re­leased.</p>
    <p>“Her forcible dis­ap­pear­ance, de­tain­ment and harsh sen­tenc­ing by the CCP (Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party) is ev­i­dence of a fam­ily suf­fer­ing the con­se­quences of speak­ing out against a gov­ern­ment that has no re­spect for hu­man rights,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ziba said she could not re­veal the source of the in­for­ma­tion on the sen­tenc­ing of her mother to pro­tect their iden­tity. “We only learnt that she is sen­tenced to 20 years, and we’re try­ing to get more in­for­ma­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>“My mum is a med­i­cal pro­fes­sional, non-po­lit­i­cal, kind per­son who has spent her life help­ing peo­ple,” she said, adding that her mother was in frag­ile health and suf­fered from mul­ti­ple con­di­tions, in­clud­ing high blood pres­sure.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese Em­bassy in Wash­ing­ton did not re­spond when asked for details of Dr Gul­shan’s sta­tus.</p>
    <p>The chair­man of the US Con­gres­sional-Ex­ec­u­tive Com­mis­sion on China, Mr James McGovern, called the pun­ish­ment of an in­no­cent fam­ily member in what he said was an at­tempt to si­lence free ex­pres­sion “morally rep­re­hen­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>He said it was just part of a “mass per­se­cu­tion” of Uighurs in China that has in­volved de­ten­tion of as many as 1.8 mil­lion peo­ple in in­tern­ment camps, forced labour and other abuses.</p>
    <p>United Na­tions ex­perts and ad­vo­cates say at least a mil­lion eth­nic Uighurs have been de­tained at some point in camps in China’s Xin­jiang re­gion.</p>
    <p>China calls the heav­ily guarded cen­tres ed­u­ca­tional and vo­ca­tional in­sti­tutes, and says that all those who at­tended have grad­u­ated and gone home.</p>
    <p>Ac­cess to the camps is re­stricted and it is not pos­si­ble to in­de­pen­dently ver­ify whether all have closed.</p>
