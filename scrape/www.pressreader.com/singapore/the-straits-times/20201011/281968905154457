    <p>MR TATSUO NAKAI, 38</p>
    <p>Moved in: Septem­ber Moved to: Makuhari, Chiba Oc­cu­pa­tion: Hu­man re­sources di­rec­tor, Lixil, a build­ing ma­te­ri­als firm</p>
    <p>“When my baby was born i n spring dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, we de­cided to move. Cen­tral Tokyo is a great lo­ca­tion if you must com­mute to work, but ide­ally, it isn’t where we wanted to raise our child.</p>
    <p>With Lixil adopt­ing tele­work poli­cies, we now have more free­dom to choose where and how we want to live. My wife and I wanted to be sur­rounded by more na­ture and have more space for the baby – as well as for our three naughty dogs.</p>
    <p>There are parks and even beaches no more than a few steps from our new home, which is larger but costs less than half the Tokyo home.</p>
    <p>As you can imag­ine, my baby and dogs re­ally love run­ning – or crawl­ing – around our much more spa­cious liv­ing room and bal­cony.</p>
    <p>Since April, I have only had to go into the of­fice once. If Lixil had not al­lowed us to work re­motely full­time, I prob­a­bly would not have made the de­ci­sion to move out of cen­tral Tokyo. My com­mut­ing time would have tripled.</p>
    <p>Although my wife, who works in the Marunouchi busi­ness district in Tokyo, still has to com­mute at least three days a week, we have found a way to bal­ance our work to bet­ter suit our life­styles.”</p>
