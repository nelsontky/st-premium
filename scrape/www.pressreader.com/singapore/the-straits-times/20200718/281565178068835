    <p>Health­care items used in the fight against Covid-19, such as sur­gi­cal masks and gloves, have been found strewn among house­hold rub­bish at dump sites on the out­skirts of Jakarta and at the city’s river es­tu­ar­ies. This has raised con­cerns that In­done­sia is strug­gling to man­age its mount­ing med­i­cal waste, caus­ing in­fec­tion risks for those who work and live near waste man­age­ment fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sur­gi­cal masks, gloves, face shields and fluid bags have been found scat­tered among daily house­hold rub­bish at two dump sites in Bekasi, on the out­skirts of Jakarta, rais­ing fears that waste pick­ers and res­i­dents nearby could be in­fected by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, health­care waste made up 16 per cent of the to­tal garbage float­ing in Cil­inc­ing and Marunda river es­tu­ar­ies in Jakarta Bay in March and April.</p>
    <p>And a key in­gre­di­ent in dis­in­fec­tants – chlo­rine – poses a ris­ing pol­lu­tion threat to the Bran­tas River es­tu­ary in In­done­sia’s sec­ond-largest city, Surabaya.</p>
    <p>These find­ings, part of data col­lected from agen­cies such as the Na­tional Waste Coali­tion and the In­done­sian In­sti­tute of Sciences, are wor­ry­ing proof that the world’s fourth-most pop­u­lous na­tion is strug­gling to man­age the mount­ing med­i­cal waste left by the bat­tle against the coro­n­avirus that has in­fected over 83,000 peo­ple and killed nearly 4,000 in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Dr In­tan Suci Nurhati, a se­nior re­searcher at LIPI’s Re­search Cen­tre for Oceanog­ra­phy, said the per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE) found in Cil­inc­ing and Marunda rivers likely came from house­holds.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the amount of med­i­cal waste, in­clud­ing PPE, sy­ringes and in­tra­venous lines surged by 70 per cent from be­fore the pan­demic to 23 tonnes daily dur­ing March to May in hos­pi­tals treat­ing Covid-19 pa­tients, ac­cord­ing to Dr Lina Tri Mugi As­tuti, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the In­done­sian En­vi­ron­men­tal Sci­en­tists As­so­ci­a­tion (IESA).</p>
    <p>She has been look­ing at data col­lected from 71 hos­pi­tals treat­ing Covid-19 pa­tients, out of 133 sur­veyed jointly by IESA and the In­done­sian Hos­pi­tals As­so­ci­a­tion from April 1 to May 20. The av­er­age daily vol­ume of waste be­fore the pan­demic was 13.6 tonnes.</p>
    <p>“That trans­lates into a rise to 1.62kg per (hospi­tal) bed in the pan­demic pe­riod, from 0.96kg be­fore the pan­demic,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Dr Lina said hos­pi­tals should use in­cin­er­a­tors to burn med­i­cal waste.</p>
    <p>“Hos­pi­tals that do not have their own in­cin­er­a­tors can work with a third party. But, they have to at least man­age the waste well be­fore dis­pos­ing them,” she said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a se­nior of­fi­cial in Jakarta dis­missed the con­cerns over med­i­cal garbage, say­ing hos­pi­tals with in­cin­er­a­tors in the cap­i­tal city are al­ready us­ing the in­cin­er­a­tors to get rid of med­i­cal waste.</p>
    <p>Ms Rosa Am­barsari, head of toxic and haz­ardous waste man­age­ment divi­sion at Jakarta’s En­vi­ron­ment Agency, said those with­out in­cin­er­a­tors are work­ing with third par­ties to sort out the med­i­cal trash.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, in In­done­sia’s sec­ond­most pop­u­lous prov­ince of East Java, Mr Mo­hamad Niza­mudin, an of­fi­cial in charge of toxic and haz­ardous man­age­ment at the prov­ince’s En­vi­ron­ment Agency, said pro­vin­cial hos­pi­tals are work­ing with med­i­cal waste pro­ces­sors.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the use of in­cin­er­a­tors has raised other con­cerns for res­i­dents who live near such fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ms Su­tamah, a res­i­dent of Lakar­dowo vil­lage in Mo­jok­erto, East Java, where a med­i­cal waste in­cin­er­a­tor is lo­cated, said in­ten­si­fied burn­ing dur­ing the pan­demic is an­other cause for con­cern.</p>
    <p>“The in­cin­er­a­tor now burns more med­i­cal waste than be­fore. It spews thick black smoke and pun­gent odours,” the 43-year-old said.</p>
    <p>She claimed that many vil­lage in­hab­i­tants have suf­fered from res­pi­ra­tory and skin prob­lems. The in­cin­er­a­tor also de­stroys med­i­cal waste from Bali is­land.</p>
    <p>Asked about ad­dress­ing chlo­rine pol­lu­tion in rivers, Eco­log­i­cal Ob­ser­va­tion and Wet­lands Con­ser­va­tion ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Prigi Arisandi said the gov­ern­ment must map out lo­ca­tions with higher chlo­rine lev­els, then trace the sources. “There should be... warn­ings that chlo­rine waste should not be dis­posed of di­rectly to drainage,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bagong Suy­oto, head of the Na­tional Waste Coali­tion, said that while waste pick­ers are aware they are at risk of Covid-19 in­fec­tion from con­tact with the med­i­cal waste they sort out, they are left with no choice.</p>
    <p>“If they don’t pick waste just for a day, they can­not eat. It is bet­ter for them to keep work­ing de­spite the threat of the dis­ease, in­stead of starv­ing,” he said.</p>
