    <p>AT­LANTA • When Dustin John­son left East Lake last year, af­ter fin­ish­ing in last place, he was headed for an op­er­at­ing ta­ble.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, he left with his first FedExCup, one of the few ac­com­plish­ments that was miss­ing from a re­sume wor­thy of the World Golf Hall of Fame.</p>
    <p>John­son is the cham­pion of a sea­son un­like any other. He did it with a month that re­minded us of how easy he can make the game look.</p>
    <p>This sea­son was any­thing but. The world No. 1 had surgery on his knee less than two weeks af­ter last year’s Tour Cham­pi­onship and didn’t play un­til the Pres­i­dents Cup in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>He made just four starts be­fore the PGA Tour sea­son was shut down for three months by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter his first win of the sea­son – the Trav­el­ers Cham­pi­onship in June – he shot back-to-back 80s at Memo­rial the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never seen him that lost,” said third-ranked Justin Thomas, who played with him that week.</p>
    <p>But John­son is known for his abil­ity to re­cover from set­backs and tough losses.</p>
    <p>Per­haps that is why he is a fit­ting cham­pion for this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Af­ter beat­ing just one player at Memo­rial and with­draw­ing from his next start be­cause of a back in­jury, John­son put on an im­pres­sive dis­play over his fi­nal four starts.</p>
    <p>He closed the sea­son with two wins and two run­ners-up. He was the 54-hole leader in all four events.</p>
    <p>Only two 64s – from Collin Morikawa at the PGA Cham­pi­onship and Jon Rahm at the BMW</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­onship – and two of the sea­son’s most in­cred­i­ble shots could stop John­son dur­ing that clos­ing stretch.</p>
    <p>Af­ter win­ning last month’s North­ern Trust by 11, he then sealed the Tour Cham­pi­onship on Mon­day with a fi­nal round two-un­der 68 for a to­tal 21-un­der 269.</p>
    <p>The three-shot vic­tory over fel­low Amer­i­cans Xan­der Schauf­fele and Thomas, the 2017 FedExCup cham­pion, meant that John­son fi­nally took home the US$15 mil­lion (S$20.6 mil­lion) pay­day af­ter qual­i­fy­ing for East Lake in each of the last 12 sea­sons.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing a FedExCup cham­pion is some­thing that I re­ally wanted to do,” he said. “I wanted to hold that tro­phy at the end of the day. It was some­thing that I wanted to ac­com­plish dur­ing my ca­reer.”</p>
    <p>The 2016 US Open win­ner is the un­ques­tioned top player in the game right now.</p>
    <p>His three vic­to­ries this sea­son tied Thomas for the most on the Tour. The 36-year-old, with a sec­ond place at the sea­son’s only Ma­jor, is also the favourite to be voted PGA Player of the Year by his peers. What a dif­fer­ence a year makes. John­son could barely beat any­one by the end of last sea­son be­cause of his knee and just three months ago, af­ter miss­ing the cut at the Charles Sch­wab Chal­lenge in June, he was 115th in the FedEx Cup points list.</p>
    <p>Prais­ing his Pres­i­dents Cup team­mate, Thomas said: “He was putting so bad, play­ing so bad. But he never gave up. He wasn’t quit­ting... then next thing you know, what, two months later he’s the FedExCup cham­pion and run­ning away. That’s all you need to know about golf right there.”</p>
    <p>Be­cause of his in­juries and strug­gles, John­son has been over­shad­owed by work­out buddy Brooks Koepka and Rory McIl­roy over the last two years.</p>
    <p>But not any­more.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously I’m play­ing very well now,” he said. “I feel like I can play bet­ter, though.”</p>
    <p>That is a scary thought.</p>
