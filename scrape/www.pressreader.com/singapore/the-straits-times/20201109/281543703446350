    <p>Some 1,200 leak-mon­i­tor­ing sen­sors are to be de­ployed is­land­wide be­fore the end of next year, adding to PUB’s toolkit of new leak de­tec­tion tech­nolo­gies. The wa­ter agency said last Fri­day that 120 such sen­sors cur­rently line the large wa­ter mains here, mon­i­tor­ing and analysing noises in the pipes to pick up the pres­ence of leaks.</p>
    <p>Some 1,200 leak mon­i­tor­ing sen­sors are to be de­ployed is­land­wide be­fore the end of next year, adding to PUB’s toolkit of new leak de­tec­tion tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>The wa­ter agency said last Fri­day that 120 such sen­sors cur­rently line the large wa­ter mains here, mon­i­tor­ing and analysing noises in the pipes to pick up the pres­ence of leaks.</p>
    <p>These sen­sors are able to ac­cu­rately iden­tify and pin­point the lo­ca­tion of a leak within 3m.</p>
    <p>In the three years since the sen­sors were pi­loted in 2017, they have de­tected 13 leaks – in­clud­ing a 13mm hole at the base of a pipe be­side a ma­jor ex­press­way.</p>
    <p>While some may think wa­ter leaks are a rare oc­cur­rence here, PUB has recorded about five leaks per 100km of pipes yearly in re­cent years. As Sin­ga­pore’s pipe net­work stretches over about 5,700km, this makes for about 285 leaks a year, or about five a week.</p>
    <p>Mr Waseem Khan, 31, who leads PUB’s leak de­tec­tion unit, clar­i­fied that this is ac­tu­ally one of the low­est rates in the world. The se­nior en­gi­neer added that it is not pos­si­ble to have no leaks in a wa­ter sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“As your pipe­line ages, it un­der­goes wear and tear. (Also), with the soil con­di­tion, you might have cor­ro­sion. You might have works on­go­ing, so third-party dam­age might oc­cur when some­one ex­ca­vates and hits your pipe,” he said.</p>
    <p>PUB said it is im­por­tant to con­tin­u­ally de­tect and re­pair leaks – even small ones – be­fore they es­ca­late, in or­der to con­serve pre­cious wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The agency last Fri­day un­veiled sev­eral new tech­nolo­gies that as­sist in this en­deav­our.</p>
    <p>These in­clude SmartBall – a round sensor en­cased in a pro­tec­tive foam cov­er­ing. It is put into a pipe and pro­pelled along by the flow of the wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The sensor de­tects any cracks or anom­alies along the walls of the pipe by pick­ing up noise sig­na­tures re­lated to leaks. It can sur­vey long stretches of pipe in a sin­gle de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Over 500km of pipes will be mon­i­tored by these sen­sors over the next five years, said the agency.</p>
    <p>PUB’s leak de­tec­tion teams have also been equipped with smart­phone sen­sors since last year.</p>
    <p>One end of the sensor is at­tached to any smart­phone, while the other is placed on a pipe fit­ting to pick up sounds from the pipe.</p>
    <p>An app on the phone will au­to­mat­i­cally digi­tise and an­a­lyse the sounds picked up by the sensor, while fil­ter­ing out any am­bi­ent noise, ac­cu­rately pin­point­ing the lo­ca­tion of any leaks.</p>
    <p>These com­ple­ment the noise log­gers and cor­re­la­tors, de­vices in­tro­duced in the 2000s that also help to check for leaks.</p>
    <p>The use of tech­nol­ogy has re­duced train­ing time for new tech­ni­cians, said Mr Khan. “Pre­vi­ously, you’d need a few months, maybe even years, depend­ing on the per­son, to be able to train them up to use some of these tools for leak de­tec­tion. Now, with the im­ple­men­ta­tion of tech­nol­ogy, the learn­ing curve has short­ened to maybe a few weeks, a few months.”</p>
    <p>PUB direc­tor of wa­ter sup­ply (net­work) Ridzuan Is­mail said: “PUB is al­ways on the look­out for new tech­nolo­gies for early leak de­tec­tion, so that we can min­imise wa­ter loss in the net­work and in­crease the re­silience of ser­vice that we pro­vide to our cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“With in­tel­li­gent leak mon­i­tor­ing and de­tec­tion tech­nol­ogy, we are tak­ing a more pre­ven­tive and pre­dic­tive ap­proach and mov­ing away from a re­source-in­ten­sive op­er­a­tion that re­quires very spe­cialised skills. This will bring us closer to our goal of trans­form­ing our op­er­a­tions through dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion to be­come a smart util­ity of the fu­ture.”</p>
