    <p>A tele­health pro­gramme for pa­tients with high blood pres­sure is be­ing rolled out by all three poly­clinic clus­ters, en­abling pa­tients to mon­i­tor their blood pres­sure at home with the aid of a Blue­tooth-en­abled de­vice that au­to­mat­i­cally trans­mits the read­ings to a care team as well as re­duce their poly­clinic vis­its.</p>
    <p>The home blood pres­sure (BP) mon­i­tor­ing pro­gramme was rolled out at Ang Mo Kio (AMK) Poly­clinic about two months ago and at Be­dok Poly­clinic last month. It will be avail­able at Cle­menti Poly­clinic in the first half of next year. There­after, each clus­ter will push it out to poly­clin­ics un­der their care.</p>
    <p>The roll-out is ex­pected to be com­pleted in about three years, Min­istry of Health Of­fice for Healthcare Trans­for­ma­tion (MOHT) ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Tan Chorh Chuan told re­porters at AMK Poly­clinic on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients in the pro­gramme will be given a Blue­tooth-en­abled de­vice and be asked to down­load an app. They are to take their BP read­ings at least once a week with the de­vice, which au­to­mat­i­cally trans­mits the data to the pa­tients’ poly­clinic care team through the app. If their BP lev­els are not well con­trolled, they will re­ceive chat­bot alerts and tips on BP con­trol. The app can also re­mind them to take their read­ings.</p>
    <p>If needed, ad­di­tional tele­con­sul­ta­tion ad­vice will be pro­vided by their nurse and their med­i­ca­tion may be ad­justed. The app is in English, though the chat­bot alerts are also avail­able in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme costs $6.30 a month for the first two years, in­clu­sive of the de­vice and app sub­scrip­tion, and $7 a month for sub­se­quent years.</p>
    <p>A six-month pi­lot project, which started in Septem­ber last year at AMK Poly­clinic, showed that about 60 per cent of the 120 pa­tients with un­con­trolled BP at the start, and who used the tele­mon­i­tor­ing ser­vice to track their BP lev­els at least once a week, achieved BP con­trol. This com­pared with 52.6 per cent of the 120 pa­tients in the group re­ceiv­ing the usual care, which in­volved mak­ing two to four phys­i­cal vis­its a year to see the doc­tor.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients who sign up for this BP tele­mon­i­tor­ing ser­vice will get a con­sult with the poly­clinic doc­tor, and then a phone con­sul­ta­tion with a nurse in six months’ time, said Dr Va­lerie Teo, a fam­ily physi­cian, con­sul­tant and deputy head of AMK Poly­clinic. Only suit­able pa­tients will be en­rolled, as those with di­a­betes and/or com­plex con­di­tions who re­quire closer mon­i­tor­ing are not suit­able, she added.</p>
    <p>Madam Tham Siew Yee, 65, is one of 250 pa­tients who have en­rolled in the pro­gramme since it was launched at AMK Poly­clinic.</p>
    <p>The re­tiree said it re­moved the need for man­u­ally record­ing her BP lev­els, which she used to do three times a day. Now, she checks her BP one to three times a week.</p>
    <p>“The thing I find use­ful and com­fort­ing is that the read­ing is im­me­di­ately up­loaded and checked by a healthcare team be­hind the scenes on a reg­u­lar ba­sis. This means they don’t need to re­view it only in three months, or six months or at my next ap­point­ment,” she said.</p>
    <p>Hy­per­ten­sion af­fects one in four Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 30 or older, and up to half have un­con­trolled BP, which can lead to se­ri­ous prob­lems, such as stroke and heart fail­ure.</p>
    <p>The BP tele­health pro­gramme was the re­sult of Pri­mary Tech-En­hanced Care – a part­ner­ship be­tween MOHT, Na­tional Healthcare Group Poly­clin­ics, SingHealth Poly­clin­ics, Na­tional Univer­sity Poly­clin­ics and In­te­grated Health In­for­ma­tion Sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Go­ing for­ward, the plan is to roll this out to gen­eral prac­ti­tion­ers as well as in­tro­duce tele­health ser­vices for other chronic con­di­tions, said Pro­fes­sor Tan.</p>
