        <p>Home buy­ers can now get pric­ing and loan in­for­ma­tion of new Hous­ing Board flats on a por­tal which aims to stream­line the process of buy­ing and sell­ing a flat.</p>
        <p>The por­tal, which was launched yes­ter­day, con­sol­i­dates in­for­ma­tion on cur­rent and up­com­ing flats sold di­rectly by HDB, said Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee. It is be­ing pro­gres­sively rolled out and may in­clude HDB re­sale flat list­ings in the fu­ture.</p>
        <p>“This new por­tal will make it more con­ve­nient for home buy­ers and sellers to gather in­for­ma­tion on the pur­chase or sale of a flat through a sin­gle in­te­grated plat­form,” he said in a Face­book post.</p>
        <p>Those hunt­ing for a home can now get pric­ing and loan in­for­ma­tion of new Hous­ing Board flats on a plat­form which aims to stream­line the process of buy­ing and sell­ing a place.</p>
        <p>The por­tal, which is be­ing pro­gres­sively rolled out from yes­ter­day, con­sol­i­dates in­for­ma­tion on cur­rent and up­com­ing flats sold di­rectly by HDB, said Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee in a Face­book post.</p>
        <p>He added that it may in­clude HDB re­sale flat list­ings in sub­se­quent phases.</p>
        <p>HDB al­ready has a sep­a­rate plat­form for re­sale flats, which was launched in Jan­uary 2018. It is where po­ten­tial buy­ers com­mence their ap­pli­ca­tion for their re­sale flat of choice.</p>
        <p>The por­tal for new flats and the plat­form for re­sale flats will run in tan­dem on HDB’s web­site.</p>
        <p>Aside from list­ings, the plat­form for new flats also in­cludes fi­nan­cial cal­cu­la­tors for would-be buy­ers to es­ti­mate their hous­ing bud­get. This is to help them com­pare their hous­ing op­tions, said Mr Lee.</p>
        <p>Those in­tend­ing to sell their flats can use the cal­cu­la­tors to es­ti­mate their sales pro­ceeds, which also take into ac­count monies which have to be re­turned to their Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund. They will also be able to view past trans­ac­tions around their es­tate.</p>
        <p>“This new por­tal will make it more con­ve­nient for home buy­ers and sellers to gather in­for­ma­tion on the pur­chase or sale of a flat through a sin­gle in­te­grated plat­form,” said Mr Lee. Those in­ter­ested can find more in­for­ma­tion at https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/ land­ing. A SingPass ac­count is needed to ac­cess some ser­vices.</p>
        <p>As for sellers and buy­ers of re­sale flats, they will have to use the HDB re­sale por­tal to com­plete their trans­ac­tions. The re­sale por­tal cuts the trans­ac­tion time from 16 weeks to eight weeks when there are no hitches in the process.</p>
        <p>OrangeTee & Tie se­nior vi­cepres­i­dent of re­search and an­a­lyt­ics Chris­tine Sun said the new HDB flat por­tal makes it eas­ier for users to ob­tain most of the es­sen­tial in­for­ma­tion. It is also use­ful for those eye­ing re­sale flats.</p>
        <p>“Some may use the sug­gested pay­ment plan in the new por­tal as a ref­er­ence or benchmark when they talk to prop­erty or bank con­sul­tants prior to pur­chas­ing a re­sale flat,” she said.</p>
        <p>How­ever, she noted that users of the por­tal for new list­ings can cur­rently view only Build-To-Or­der (BTO) projects launched in the last year. Launches be­fore 2020 do not show up. “HDB may con­sider show­ing past sub­scrip­tion rates and in­dica­tive prices of ear­lier BTO launches by towns be­yond the last year,” she said.</p>
        <p>ERA Re­alty’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ni­cholas Mak said that while the por­tal stream­lines the process, it does not mean prop­erty agents are ob­so­lete.</p>
        <p>He noted that the process of find­ing and se­cur­ing a flat of choice, or when sell­ing a unit, may be too daunt­ing for some. “Prop­erty agents could help their clients to achieve the best price as they have the mar­ket knowl­edge and ex­pe­ri­ence,” he said.</p>
        <p>Mr Ni­cholas Chan, 31, a Christian min­is­ter who is in the process of book­ing a BTO flat in Bis­han with his part­ner, said: “Be­fore we booked the Bis­han BTO, we used the cal­cu­la­tors avail­able on the HDB web­site, but we found we had to click around to find the in­for­ma­tion we needed, such as the process of se­lect­ing a flat. This por­tal for new list­ings makes every­thing more ac­ces­si­ble.”</p>
