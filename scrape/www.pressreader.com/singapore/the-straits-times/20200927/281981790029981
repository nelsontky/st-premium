    <p>Tough times call for flex­i­ble ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>In the light of the Covid-19 pan­demic which has thrown the sched­ules for the Asian Tour and Asian De­vel­op­ment Tour in dis­ar­ray, Sin­ga­pore pro­fes­sional golfers are go­ing through a dif­fi­cult patch.</p>
    <p>They have been side­lined for al­most six months now with no com­pe­ti­tions be­cause of the play­ing re­stric­tions and safety mea­sures to com­bat the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In the midst of the pan­demic, the Sin­ga­pore Pro­fes­sional Golfers’ As­so­ci­a­tion (SPGA) held its vir­tual an­nual meet­ing a fort­night ago, and the same faces were re-elected.</p>
    <p>M Mu­ru­giah ex­tended his pres­i­dency to just be­yond 12 years, and fa­mil­iar names Chang Ren Chiat (vi­cepres­i­dent), Jack Solomon (sec­re­tary) and Nasarudin Alias (trea­surer) were also re­turned un­op­posed.</p>
    <p>Mu­ru­giah, 56, who runs his own teach­ing academy at the War­ren Golf and Coun­try Club and was first elected SPGA pres­i­dent in 2008, is aware of his fel­low-pro­fes­sion­als’ predica­ment and is look­ing into help­ing them in their ca­reers.</p>
    <p>He has en­cour­aged Sin­ga­pore’s lead­ing pro­fes­sional Mar­dan Ma­mat and rookie pro Marc Ong to do teach­ing at his academy on a part-time ba­sis while they keep their play­ing touch with rounds mostly at the Choa Chu Kang lay­out.</p>
    <p>Another lead­ing pro Quincy Quek, who used to be a reg­u­lar at the China PGA Tour Se­ries, is also feel­ing the ef­fects of be­ing grounded. How­ever, he teaches twice a week at the golf­inglab at Na­tional Ser­vice Re­sort and Coun­try Club in Changi while spend­ing most of the time look­ing af­ter his sec­ond-born, a boy (five months old) and at­tend­ing to his three-year-old daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Quek is happy that his sponsors, namely Audi, and equip­ment and ap</p>
    <p>parel com­pa­nies such as Tay­lorMade, Titleist, Fenix, Adi­das golf and Oak­ley have stayed with him.</p>
    <p>Two other no­table pro­fes­sion­als, Koh Deng­shan and Choo Tze Huang con­tinue to play and prac­tise at least five times a week in the hope that com­pe­ti­tions will re­sume early next year. The duo have se­cured a money (undis­closed) spon­sor in two busi­ness­men James Koh and Kelvin Chng.</p>
    <p>Koh is co-owner of watch com­pany Chrono95 and Chng is founder and ad­viser of Fin­tech Al­liance Global.</p>
    <p>With venues such as clubs in Jo­hor, Batam and Bin­tan not per­mit­ted</p>
    <p>to ac­com­mo­date Sin­ga­pore­ans and most lo­cal clubs feel­ing the pres­sure of al­low­ing play­ing priv­i­leges only to mem­bers, the SPGA is strug­gling to find a venue to keep their pro­fes­sion­als en­gaged in the game.</p>
    <p>Added to that is the strict ap­pli­ca­tion of safety mea­sures, like safe dis­tanc­ing and avoid­ance of crowd con­gre­ga­tion, which calls for proper dis­ci­pline among play­ers if a tour­na­ment is to be held.</p>
    <p>The SPGA, how­ever, is hop­ing to get clear­ance from Sport­sSG to stage an event soon un­der strict guide­lines.</p>
