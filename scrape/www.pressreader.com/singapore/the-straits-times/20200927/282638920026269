    <p>Make sure your phone is fully charged be­cause you will not want to miss out on the photo op­por­tu­ni­ties at Soek Seng 1954 Bi­cy­cle Cafe.</p>
    <p>From the blue vin­tage Volk­swa­gen at the en­trance to bike art in­stal­la­tions, colour­ful art­work on the ta­bles and re­stored bi­cy­cles on the walls, there is no lack of ma­te­rial for so­cial-me­dia posts and sto­ries.</p>
    <p>In 2016, owner Poon Kng Joo, 64, opened the cafe, named af­ter his father’s mo­tor work­shop set up in 1954, to keep his father’s legacy alive.</p>
    <p>The cafe also serves as a venue for Mr Poon to share his love for art and cy­cling. Most of the art in­stal­la­tions and art­work were cre­ated by him, in­clud­ing the hand-painted signs on the ta­ble tops.</p>
    <p>He also re­stored 17 of the 19 bi­cy­cles on dis­play.</p>
    <p>With the cafe lo­cated next to Sele­tar Air­port, din­ers can get a view of the run­way and parked planes.</p>
    <p>Out­side, there is a Shi­mano-spon­sored tool stand for cyclists.</p>
    <p>The cafe has two sec­tions for in­door din­ing, which seat 32 peo­ple af­ter fac­tor­ing in safe dis­tanc­ing. The out­door din­ing area can seat 20.</p>
    <p>De­spite its far-out lo­ca­tion, the place is pop­u­lar even on week­days, so it is best to make reser­va­tions.</p>
    <p>Prices are nett. Although food and drink or­ders are sent to ta­bles, this is meant to be a self-ser­vice joint.</p>
    <p>Tuck into no-frills com­fort food here, such as Fish & Chips ($11.80) – made us­ing yel­low­tail as Mr Poon is not a fan of dory. The Sir­loin Steak ($15) and Ayam Pang­gang ($10.80) are other pop­u­lar op­tions.</p>
