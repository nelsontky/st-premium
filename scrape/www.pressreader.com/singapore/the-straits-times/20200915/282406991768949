    <p>Mu­sic-lov­ing fans from Sin­ga­pore’s sil­ver gen­er­a­tion will soon have a new free app tai­lored for them – Vin­tage Ra­dio SG.</p>
    <p>To be launched to­mor­row, the online ra­dio app will stream clas­sic pop tunes from the 1950s to the 1970s by artists from rock ’n’ roll king Elvis Pres­ley to lo­cal acts such as Naomi & The Boys.</p>
    <p>It will be an­chored by mul­ti­lin­gual pre­sen­ters whose voices are fa­mil­iar to se­niors here – broad­cast­ing vet­eran Brian Rich­mond, singer and ra­dio host P.N. Bala Supra­ma­niam and for­mer Red­if­fu­sion DJ</p>
    <p>Pa­trick Kwek, also known as Guo Xian­hua, as well as singer Rahimah Rahim.</p>
    <p>The app, which also fea­tures other con­tent geared to­wards se­niors, is the brain­child of for­mer ra­dio pre­sen­ters Mark Rich­mond, 49, and Aloy­sius Tan, 53, as well as sev­eral of their part­ners.</p>
    <p>While mu­sic will be streamed 24 hours, the dee­jays will present only from 8am to mid­night on week­days. Their pre­sen­ta­tions are pre­re­corded.</p>
    <p>Long-time ra­dio lis­ten­ers will re­mem­ber Mark Rich­mond, who is Brian Rich­mond’s son, and Tan as dee­jays from the con­tem­po­rary pop ra­dio sta­tion that is now known as 987. They spent the last six months work­ing on the app while jug­gling their full-time jobs. Mark Rich­mond is Sport Sin­ga­pore’s team lead of Team Sin­ga­pore while Tan runs Ra­dioac­tive.sg, a com­pany that pro­vides stream­ing so­lu­tions for ra­dio net­works.</p>
    <p>Vin­tage Ra­dio SG re­ceived funds from phil­an­thropic groups The Ma­ju­rity Trust, Tsao Foun­da­tion and Oc­tava Foun­da­tion, as well as Temasek Trust’s os­car@sg fund and arts sup­porter An­tho­nia Hui.</p>
    <p>The app is de­signed to be eas­ily used by those who might not be tech-savvy.</p>
    <p>Says Mark Rich­mond: “We’re not here to change the whole ra­dio land­scape. This is some­thing that is unashamedl­y se­nior-cen­tric. Through mu­sic, they can re­live and rekin­dle their past.”</p>
    <p>Tan says the app lets se­niors fa­mil­iarise them­selves with dig­i­tal con­tent in a se­cure en­vi­ron­ment, with­out wor­ry­ing about spam, phish­ing scams or other online haz­ards.</p>
    <p>They did sev­eral focus-group dis­cus­sions with se­niors to find out how best the app can serve them. Some of the con­tent avail­able in­clude ar­ti­cles and videos cen­tred on top­ics such as health and fi­nan­cial lit­er­acy.</p>
    <p>Users are also en­cour­aged to con­trib­ute con­tent. For ex­am­ple, they can be­come pre­sen­ters over the weekend by record­ing them­selves and send­ing over au­dio files, or sub­mit pic­tures for a gallery that fea­tures old pho­to­graphs.</p>
    <p>Tan says the app is de­signed to use min­i­mal data. Users whose de­vices are not con­nected to Wi-Fi will not have to worry about it eat­ing up their data plan, he as­sures.</p>
    <p>Rahimah, who will make her de­but as a ra­dio pre­sen­ter, will speak in both Malay and English.</p>
    <p>“It’s some­thing I’ve never done be­fore but it’s fun and I take it as a chal­lenge,” says the 64-year-old.</p>
    <p>“I’m used to talk­ing to the au­di­ence when I’m on stage, but pre­sent­ing on ra­dio is dif­fer­ent. You can’t see your au­di­ence so you have to vi­su­alise what you want to say.”</p>
    <p>Brian Rich­mond, 73, says he is happy to be part of a project that helps se­niors like him­self be tech­savvy. “Play­ing songs that are oldies but goldies, it’s right up my al­ley, it’s what I do best,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I’ll also in­clude Sin­ga­pore trivia, in­ter­est­ing ‘ did you know?’ fun facts to spice things up.”</p>
    <p>Rich­mond’s words carry a lot of weight among his peers, says Tan. He re­lates how it was dif­fi­cult for him to con­vince his mother, who has Alzheimer’s dis­ease, to stay home or wear a mask when go­ing out dur­ing the pan­demic. “But for peo­ple like her to hear some­one fa­mil­iar like Brian give a pub­lic ser­vice an­nounce­ment, they will take it se­ri­ously, they will lis­ten to them.”</p>
