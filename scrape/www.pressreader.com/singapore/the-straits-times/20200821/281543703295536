    <p>Some high-end watch brands are fi­nally mov­ing into the dig­i­tal era. From aug­mented-re­al­ity fil­ters to chat­bots that con­nect clients with vir­tual sales as­sis­tants, the rapidly ex­pand­ing use of tech­nol­ogy is strik­ing for an in­dus­try whose three best-sell­ing brands do not sup­port e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • It has taken a pan­demic – with shops closed around the world and sales plung­ing – but some high-end watch brands are fi­nally mov­ing into the dig­i­tal era.</p>
    <p>From aug­mented-re­al­ity fil­ters that let you “try on” a watch at home to chat­bots that con­nect clients with vir­tual sales as­sis­tants, the rapidly ex­pand­ing use of tech­nol­ogy is strik­ing for an in­dus­try whose three best­selling brands – Aude­mars Piguet, Rolex and Patek Philippe – do not sup­port e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>And where on­line ex­pe­ri­ences still are con­sid­ered at odds with the very essence of lux­ury.</p>
    <p>Yes, other in­dus­tries moved into the arena years ago. But the speed at which watch sell­ers now are mi­grat­ing on­line – and reach­ing out di­rectly to the pub­lic – re­flects a sud­denly ur­gent need to keep pace with con­sumers ac­cus­tomed to dig­i­tal en­gage­ment, ei­ther be­cause they have hardly known a world with­out it or be­cause the coro­n­avirus out­break has de­manded it.</p>
    <p>“It’s crazy how fast it goes,” said Mr Marco Ga­bella, a co-founder of the watch site Watchon­ista. “Brands have been afraid of dig­i­tal for a long time and now that fear is evap­o­rat­ing.”</p>
    <p>To ap­pre­ci­ate how lit­er­ally the in­dus­try’s chief ex­ec­u­tives have in­ter­preted the con­cept of go­ing di­rect, sim­ply hop on In­sta­gram or join one of the trade’s by-nowu­biq­ui­tous Zoom pre­sen­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“Three weeks ago, I had no idea what an In­sta­gram Live was,” said Mr Max­i­m­il­ian Busser, founder and cre­ative di­rec­tor of the Genev­abased in­de­pen­dent brand MB&F. In mid-May, he used the plat­form to show­case 55 Min­utes, a se­ries of in­ter­views with fel­low watch ex­ec­u­tives and de­sign­ers. “Now we have these for­mats where we’re so much closer and so much more hu­mane.”</p>
    <p>Mr Busser’s first guest was Mr Pa­trick Pru­ni­aux, chief ex­ec­u­tive of two Ker­ing-owned lux­ury watch brands, Ulysse Nardin and Gi­rardPer­re­gaux.</p>
    <p>Mr Pru­ni­aux is a for­mer Ap­ple ex­ec­u­tive, who joined the tech gi­ant in 2014 to work on the first gen­er­a­tion of its smart­watch. He has em­braced video con­fer­enc­ing to stay con­nected with em­ploy­ees and clients dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In May, he con­ducted one-onone Zoom and Mi­crosoft Teams chats with VIP clients to pique their in­ter­est i n t he Freak X Blue Bucherer, a lim­ited-edi­tion watch that Ulysse Nardin and the Swiss re­tailer Bucherer re­leased in June.</p>
    <p>“I don’t see these as sell­ing ses­sions,” Mr Pru­ni­aux said. “Very of­ten, we just de­scribe the prod­uct, but the video con­fer­ence, and the fact that we can bring peo­ple on board that were there at the ori­gin of the prod­uct, adds more value.”</p>
    <p>GEN­ER­AT­ING CU­RIOS­ITY</p>
    <p>While sales are the ul­ti­mate goal, much of the lat­est tech­nol­ogy is de­signed to gen­er­ate cu­rios­ity that would lead po­ten­tial clients to en­gage with a brand on­line.</p>
    <p>On May 15, for ex­am­ple, the Watches of Switzer­land Group, the Le­ices­ter, Eng­land-based owner of nu­mer­ous multi- and mono-brand stores in the United States and Bri­tain, co-hosted a Zoom news con­fer­ence with the Ja­panese watch­maker Grand Seiko to pre­view a new time­piece, the Toge Spe­cial Edi­tion.</p>
    <p>There had been plans to un­veil the model in early April at a pop-up shop in Man­hat­tan, but the cri­sis forced the part­ners to change course.</p>
    <p>“When we started talk­ing about this pro­ject over a year ago, I was imag­in­ing a big party in our New York store and maybe some Ja­panese whiskey,” Mr David Hur­ley, ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent of Watches of Switzer­land Group, said dur­ing the Zoom event.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Grand Seiko worked with Face­book’s Spark AR Stu­dio soft­ware to de­velop an aug­ment­e­dreal­ity fil­ter – what Watches of Switzer­land called a first of its kind for the in­dus­try – that en­ables peo­ple to pro­ject the watch onto their wrists, size a holo­gram of the time­piece up or down, ro­tate it and, cru­cially, snap a photo to share on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“At first, I did not as­so­ciate this tech­nol­ogy with our brand – es­pe­cially be­cause our col­lec­tors al­ways talk about the qual­ity of our di­als and fin­ish­ing,” said Mr Brice Le Troadec, pres­i­dent of Grand Seiko Corp of Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>“But we’ve been try­ing to find cre­ative so­lu­tions out­side of what is nor­mally done in our in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>IWC Schaffhaus­en, one of eight spe­cial­ity watch­mak­ers owned by the Swiss gi­ant Com­pag­nie Fi­nanciere Richemont, can re­late.</p>
    <p>In late April, the brand used aug­mented re­al­ity to high­light its 2020 Por­tugieser col­lec­tion, which de­buted through the on­line edi­tion of the trade fair Watches & Won­ders. A month later, it rolled out a Face­book chat­bot pi­lot pro­gram, giv­ing on­line cus­tomers di­rect ac­cess to a vir­tual ad­viser.</p>
    <p>Also in May, IWC opened its first Vir­tual Bou­tique, a 360-de­gree dig­i­tal re­pro­duc­tion of its flag­ship store in Sin­ga­pore’s Ion Or­chard mall, and hosted two events for se­lected clients com­plete with mix-yourown cock­tails, in­clud­ing a Ne­groni and a Sakura Mar­tini, de­liv­ered via snail mail.</p>
    <p>“We also pro­vided a match­ing Spo­tify playlist to cre­ate the same vibe for ev­ery­one,” IWC’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Christoph Grainger-Herr wrote in an e-mail. “Cus­tomers could walk around in the vir­tual bou­tique, look at watches and in­ter­act with each other as well as with an IWC sales as­so­ciate.”</p>
    <p>The one thing cus­tomers could not do: Buy watches.</p>
    <p>CHAL­LENGE TO SELL ON­LINE</p>
    <p>For most watch brands and deal­ers, get­ting up to speed on ba­sic dig­i­tal strate­gies that have the po­ten­tial to jump-start sales has be­come a top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>“Cre­at­ing choice for how you shop or phys­i­cally get the prod­uct – most of that will be quite sticky,” said Mr Steve No­ble, a se­nior part­ner with McKin­sey & Com­pany, based in Min­neapo­lis. “Some cus­tomers will crave a face-to-face in­ter­ac­tion, an­other group will crave in­ter­ac­tion but not phys­i­cally, while oth­ers will want an en­tirely con­tact­less process.”</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing the new re­al­ity, some for­mer e-com­merce hold­outs have moved into di­rect-to­con­sumer on­line sales in­clud­ing Hublot, Ulysse Nardin and Zenith.</p>
    <p>Mr Pru­ni­aux said: “We know the vast ma­jor­ity of the ex­pe­ri­ence of buy­ing a watch starts on­line.</p>
    <p>“E-com­merce just con­tin­ues the ex­pe­ri­ence, and whether peo­ple buy on­line from our part­ners or our site, we want the ex­pe­ri­ence to be good.”</p>
    <p>Watch­mak­ers also want the ex­pe­ri­ence to be con­sis­tent – but pric­ing can vary widely de­pend­ing on cus­tomers’ lo­ca­tions (prices vary from coun­try to coun­try) and whether they buy di­rectly from the brand or a multi-brand re­tailer, as whole­sale part­ners are not ob­li­gated to sell watches at full re­tail price.</p>
    <p>“It’s all about dis­counts,” said Mr Ali Mu­dara, founder of Pro­jekt8, a lux­ury watch bou­tique in Bahrain. “Cus­tomers come to the store and they ne­go­ti­ate a price. Why buy on­line if they get it cheaper in store?”</p>
    <p>The Swiss watch in­dus­try’s mot­ley ap­proach to pric­ing is not the only ob­sta­cle to cre­at­ing a seam­less omni-chan­nel of­fer­ing for would-be buy­ers.</p>
    <p>Many of the world’s finest watch re­tail­ers – in­clud­ing the Ham­burg, Ger­many-based Wempe and The Hour Glass, head­quar­tered in Sin­ga­pore – sim­ply are not equipped to sell on­line.</p>
    <p>And as pur­vey­ors of the Big Three brands, they are not in­cen­tivised to do so.</p>
    <p>“We are not go­ing to go and sell on the In­ter­net to­mor­row, but that doesn’t mean we are not look­ing at it,” said Mr Fran­cois-Henry Ben­nah­mias, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Aude­mars Piguet. “We are man­ag­ing scarcity, any­way. So it would be a lit­tle coun­ter­pro­duc­tive to of­fer watches on­line that we can­not de­liver.”</p>
    <p>If only all watch brands had such prob­lems.</p>
    <p>With sales of Swiss time­pieces down by dou­ble dig­its in ev­ery ma­jor mar­ket, the prospect of un­sold in­ven­tory means com­pa­nies are scram­bling to re­vamp their dis­tri­bu­tion mod­els. While of­fer­ing di­rect dig­i­tal sales is one way to do that, the de­ci­sion has vast con­se­quences for an in­dus­try built on re­la­tion­ships with whole­salers.</p>
    <p>To pre­pare for a fu­ture in which they may find them­selves in di­rect com­pe­ti­tion with their sup­pli­ers, many watch re­tail­ers have be­come tech con­verts, preach­ing the gospel of Zoom events and on­line chat func­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Oliver Smith owns a name­sake watch and jew­ellery bou­tique in Scotts­dale, Ari­zona, and a Pan­erai bou­tique in As­pen, Colorado.</p>
    <p>He said he woke up one day in May, “and it hit me: I think we could sell some of our prod­ucts on Zoom”.</p>
    <p>On May 15, he used the plat­form for an on­line auc­tion of 35 pre­owned time­pieces. “We sold all but one, maybe two watches, in­clud­ing an A. Lange & Sohne Dato­graph for US$42,000 (S$57,500) and an Aqua­naut from Patek for US$30,000.”</p>
    <p>Around the same time, he added a chat fea­ture on his web­site and ap­pointed a sales­man to re­spond to on­line queries. “We sold US$65,000 worth of watches in the first week, which we would never have sold be­fore,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Greg Si­mo­nian, pres­i­dent of the lux­ury watch re­tailer Wes­time in Los An­ge­les, re­cruited his wife Ni­cole Si­mo­nian to help him and the Bre­itling USA pres­i­dent Thierry Pris­sert present the Swiss brand’s lat­est col­lec­tion to about 30 clients dur­ing a Zoom happy hour.</p>
    <p>To make the May 7 event more fes­tive, Mr Si­mo­nian, ap­par­ently fol­low­ing the same play­book as IWC, ar­ranged for cock­tail-mak­ing kits from a lo­cal dis­tiller to be de­liv­ered to at­ten­dees. Then, via Zoom, “we had a mixol­o­gist show them how to make the per­fect Old-Fash­ioned”.</p>
    <p>“I think peo­ple found it fun,” he said. “For us to have the prod­uct and show it and ex­plain the feel of it – I think that means some­thing.”</p>
    <p>And that is why watch­mak­ers, in the great tra­di­tion of all lux­ury mak­ers, con­tinue to be ret­i­cent about on­line sales. They cling to the no­tion that a lux­ury pur­chase is most ap­peal­ing when a prospec­tive buyer can touch and feel the prod­uct.</p>
    <p>So where does that leave watch brands and re­tail­ers strug­gling to ef­fec­tively show­case a prod­uct prized for its tan­gi­ble qual­i­ties in to­day’s en­vi­ron­ment, where touch is ei­ther pro­hib­ited or lim­ited by so­cial dis­tanc­ing?</p>
    <p>“Vir­tual re­al­ity, Zoom, what­ever it is – the fo­cus will be on tech­nol­ogy re­spond­ing with a whole new world of op­por­tu­nity that will make what we have now seem like just the be­gin­ning,” said Mr Peter Noel Mur­ray, an ex­pert in con­sumer psy­chol­ogy who is based in New York City.</p>
    <p>“The i n-store ex­pe­ri­ence may never be able to be repli­cated, but what choice do we have?”</p>
    <p>Three weeks ago, I had no idea what an In­sta­gram Live was. Now we have these for­mats where we’re so much closer</p>
    <p>’’ and so much more hu­mane.</p>
    <p>MR MAX­I­M­IL­IAN BUSSER (above), founder and cre­ative di­rec­tor of the Geneva-based in­de­pen­dent brand MB&F, who used the plat­form to show­case 55 Min­utes, a se­ries of in­ter­views with fel­low watch ex­ec­u­tives and de­sign­ers</p>
