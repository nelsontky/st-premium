    <p>• Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has told the EU not to threaten Bri­tain, say­ing a Bill which would breach a di­vorce treaty with the bloc was needed to pro­tect the coun­try’s in­tegrity.</p>
    <p>With the Euro­pean Union step­ping up plan­ning for talks on trade to end with­out a deal, Mr John­son has ac­cused its ne­go­tia­tors of threat­en­ing to im­pose a food block­ade be­tween main­land Bri­tain and North­ern Ire­land.</p>
    <p>“Let’s make the EU take their threats off the ta­ble”, Mr John­son said on Twit­ter yes­ter­day. “And let’s get this Bill through, back up our ne­go­tia­tors, and pro­tect our coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Bri­tish law­mak­ers will to­mor­row be­gin de­bat­ing the In­ter­nal Mar­kets Bill, which one min­is­ter has al­ready said would breach in­ter­na­tional law “in a very spe­cific and lim­ited way”.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment says it is needed to clar­ify the North­ern Ire­land pro­to­col el­e­ment of the Brexit deal it signed with the EU in Jan­uary to pro­tect free trade be­tween the four con­stituent na­tions of the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>But Euro­pean law­mak­ers on Fri­day said they would not ap­prove any new trade deal un­less the with­drawal agree­ment was fully im­ple­mented, while there is also talk of pos­si­ble le­gal ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Both sides have set a dead­line of the end of Oc­to­ber for a deal, rais­ing the prospect that nearly US$1 tril­lion (S$1.37 tril­lion) in trade be­tween the EU and Bri­tain could be thrown into con­fu­sion at the start of next year, when a tran­si­tion pe­riod ends.</p>
    <p>Writ­ing in the Daily Tele­graph, Mr John­son said a “great deal” could still be done but it ap­peared the EU were now tak­ing an “ex­treme in­ter­pre­ta­tion” of the North­ern Ir­ish pro­to­col.</p>
    <p>“We never se­ri­ously be­lieved that the EU would be will­ing to use a treaty, ne­go­ti­ated in good faith, to block­ade one part of the UK, to cut it off, or that they would ac­tu­ally threaten to de­stroy the eco­nomic and ter­ri­to­rial in­tegrity of the UK,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s Bill also faces op­po­si­tion from se­nior fig­ures in his Con­ser­va­tive Party and some of his own l aw­mak­ers who are un­happy at the prospect of in­fring­ing in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>In a video con­fer­ence call with his law­mak­ers on Fri­day, he ap­pealed for sup­port for his Bill and for them to avoid re­peat­ing the “squab­bling” over the Brexit di­vorce deal which saw some quit the party and oth­ers thrown out.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Gove, one of Mr John­son’s most se­nior min­is­ters, said the gov­ern­ment had the sup­port of its own law­mak­ers and those in other par­ties.</p>
    <p>But some were clearly un­con­vinced.</p>
    <p>“Un­a­mended I can­not sup­port this Bill... (it) is dam­ag­ing brand UK, di­min­ish­ing our role-model sta­tus as de­fender of global stan­dards,” Con­ser­va­tive law­maker To­bias Ell­wood and chair­man of Par­lia­ment’s de­fence com­mit­tee, wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Pushed on whether Bri­tain would be break­ing in­ter­na­tional law, Mr Gove said the Bill was con­sis­tent with “the rule of law” and de­nied it was a ne­go­ti­at­ing tac­tic to put pres­sure on the EU to make con­ces­sions for a trade deal.</p>
