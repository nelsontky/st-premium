    <p>Our method is called ‘de­sign­ing for the 100 per cent’. That is our as­pi­ra­tion...</p>
    <p>MR CHEW KIA HWEE, a user ex­pe­ri­ence de­signer at the Gov­ern­ment Tech­nol­ogy Agency. Its de­sign­ing team’s ef­forts in mod­ernising the 17-year-old SingPass plat­form won them a Ser­vice De­liv­ery Ex­cel­lence Award at the an­nual Pub­lic Sec­tor Trans­for­ma­tion Awards</p>
    <p>In de­vel­op­ing the SingPass Mo­bile app, the de­sign­ing team was guided by one im­por­tant prin­ci­ple: No­body gets left be­hind as Sin­ga­pore strives to­wards its vi­sion of be­ing a smart na­tion.</p>
    <p>This can be seen in the way the app in­cor­po­rates screen reader and voice com­mand func­tions, such as Siri in Ap­ple’s iOS de­vices, so users with low vi­sion can eas­ily ben­e­fit from its func­tions, said Mr Chew Kia Hwee, a user ex­pe­ri­ence de­signer at the Gov­ern­ment Tech­nol­ogy Agency (GovTech).</p>
    <p>Those with­out smart­phones can still ac­cess SingPass with a one­time pass­word (OTP) sent to them by SMS, he added.</p>
    <p>By the year end, users can also re­ceive OTPs on be­half of their fam­ily mem­bers, es­pe­cially se­niors, who do not have mo­bile phones.</p>
    <p>DE­SIGN­ING AC­CES­SI­BLE TECH­NOL­OGY</p>
    <p>The team’s ef­forts in mod­ernising the 17-year-old SingPass plat­form won them a Ser­vice De­liv­ery Ex­cel­lence Award yes­ter­day at the an­nual Pub­lic Sec­tor Trans­for­ma­tion (PST) Awards.</p>
    <p>In all, 80 awards were given out across 12 cat­e­gories to pub­lic of­fi­cers and agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the GovTech team’s ap­proach, Mr Chew said: “Our method is called ‘de­sign­ing for the 100 per cent’. That is our as­pi­ra­tion and we want to move to­wards de­sign­ing to al­low modes of ac­cess for dif­fer­ent types of users who might have a range of abil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>The app, launched in 2018, re­lies on bio­met­ric ver­i­fi­ca­tion, such as fin­ger­print scan­ners on smart­phones.</p>
    <p>It is a key part of the SingPass na­tional au­then­ti­ca­tion and dig­i­tal iden­tity sys­tem which al­lows users to ver­ify their iden­ti­ties on­line, and trans­act with not only gov­ern­ment agen­cies and ser­vices but also pri­vate sec­tor en­ti­ties such as banks and health­care in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>AL­MOST ALL TRANS­AC­TIONS ON­LINE</p>
    <p>The Hous­ing Board (HDB) won the Trans­for­ma­tive Agency of the Year Award for dig­i­tal­is­ing its ser­vices and plat­forms, among other things.</p>
    <p>More than 200 e-ser­vices are now avail­able around the clock on the HDB web­site and mo­bile app.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, it said more than 53 mil­lion trans­ac­tions were com­pleted on­line last year, ac­count­ing for about 99 per cent of all its trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Its chief ex­ec­u­tive Cheong Koon Hean said: “As a re­sult of our ser­vice trans­for­ma­tion ef­forts, phys­i­cal counter trans­ac­tions have dropped from 2.6 mil­lion in 2011 to just over 600,000 in 2019.</p>
    <p>“With al­most all our ser­vices hav­ing gone on­line, our cus­tomer ser­vice staff can fo­cus on pro­vid­ing more per­son­alised as­sis­tance in ar­eas where the hu­man touch re­mains es­sen­tial, such as fi­nan­cial coun­selling for flat own­ers with fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties.”</p>
    <p>A WORLD-CLASS IDEA</p>
    <p>An­other win­ner was a team led by Mil­i­tary Ex­pert 3 (ME3) Ng Yong</p>
    <p>Yong, a Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force (RSAF) engi­neer.</p>
    <p>ME3 Ng’s team won the Dare To Do Award for propos­ing a more ef­fi­cient way to fix de­fects in the wing po­si­tion lights on the F-15SG fighter jet.</p>
    <p>The award recog­nises pub­lic of­fi­cers or teams that iden­tify op­por­tu­ni­ties to do things bet­ter, take risks and per­se­vere. Pre­vi­ously, the stan­dard pro­ce­dure for fix­ing such de­fects was to re­place the en­tire light­ing assem­bly, which re­quired a few days of down­time.</p>
    <p>ME3 Ng and his team came up with the idea of re­plac­ing just the faulty light­ing mod­ule and worked with Amer­i­can tech­ni­cal ex­perts from air­craft man­u­fac­turer Boe­ing.</p>
    <p>The im­proved process re­sulted in cost sav­ings of about 99 per cent and re­duced the amount of time re­quired to fix the de­fect from 48 man-hours to just three.</p>
    <p>The team’s ef­forts also ben­e­fited F-15 users over­seas as the new method has now be­come part of Boe­ing’s of­fi­cial tech­ni­cal man­ual.</p>
    <p>VI­SION FOR PUB­LIC SEC­TOR TRANS­FOR­MA­TION</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Pub­lic Ser­vice Chan Chun Sing con­grat­u­lated the award win­ners in a video mes­sage shown at the vir­tual cer­e­mony. Mr Chan, who is also the Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter, said he had a two-part vi­sion for pub­lic sec­tor trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“The first part is that we can keep this lit­tle red dot of ours go­ing, grow­ing and glow­ing, so that we will dis­tin­guish our­selves as a peo­ple and as a coun­try amid all the un­cer­tain­ties and com­pe­ti­tion,” he said. “The sec­ond part of my vi­sion is that we can build a sys­tem... in which ev­ery mem­ber of our so­ci­ety can find mean­ing­ful work and find it ful­fill­ing to con­trib­ute to our con­tin­ued sur­vival and suc­cess.”</p>
