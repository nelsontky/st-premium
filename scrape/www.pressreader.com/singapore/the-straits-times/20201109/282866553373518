    <p>On the first night of her Taipei con­cert on Fri­day, Man­dopop singer Rainie Yang fell from a high stage.</p>
    <p>She es­caped with only slight in­juries to her hands and legs, but her hus­band, Chi­nese singer-song­writer Li Rong­hao, was clearly con­cerned.</p>
    <p>Yang, 36, told au­di­ences in a break be­tween per­for­mances that she fell down early in the con­cert, after the lights dimmed when she had fin­ished her ren­di­tion of her new song Bad Lady.</p>
    <p>She said: “It’s the first ac­ci­dent of my life in 20 years.” The Tai­wanese singer thanked a staff mem­ber who caught her in his arms as she fell.</p>
    <p>Li, who was not able to at­tend the con­cert, posted on Weibo a video of it sent to him by a friend.</p>
    <p>He wrote on Fri­day night: “I hon­estly thought she was in­sane sev­eral times dur­ing her prepa­ra­tion for this con­cert. I even told her off a few times. She was prac­tis­ing her dance moves so much her joints were in­flamed and she didn’t want to take med­i­ca­tion ei­ther. She couldn’t even lift her arms this morn­ing.</p>
    <p>“When I found out she fell down, I was wor­ried but also a lit­tle an­gry. Don’t worry, she was for­tu­nately caught by some­one and it’s just ex­ter­nal in­juries.”</p>
    <p>De­spite wor­ry­ing, Li praised his wife’s con­cert as “amaz­ing”.</p>
    <p>To ap­pease her hus­band, Yang replied to his post: “Hubby, don’t worry. Ev­ery­one, don’t worry. I’m fine, thanks to the pro­tec­tion of my staff mem­bers. I’ll take care of my­self to­mor­row and the day after that.”</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, the sec­ond of three nights at the Taipei Arena, she ded­i­cated the song Anony­mous Friend (2010) to her high school sweet­heart – the late Tai­wanese host-singer Alien Huang who died sud­denly of an aor­tic dis­sec­tion in Septem­ber. Although they broke up as teenagers, the two re­mained close friends and Yang con­sid­ered him to be fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Huang’s man­ager was in the au­di­ence on Satur­day night with a toy to sym­bol­ise Huang’s at­ten­dance.</p>
    <p>Be­fore his death, Huang had asked Yang to save him tick­ets for her show on Satur­day.</p>
