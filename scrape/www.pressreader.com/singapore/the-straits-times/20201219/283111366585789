    <p>•</p>
    <p>This week­end marks two mile­stones for Mikel Arteta.</p>
    <p>To­day sees the Arse­nal man­ager re­turn to Ever­ton, a club where he spent 71/ sea­sons as a player be</p>
    <p>2 fore join­ing the Gun­ners in 2011.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard will also hit the one-year mark at the Emi­rates to­mor­row, in full knowl­edge that their 13th FA Cup tri­umph in Au­gust has been tar­nished by the team’s worst start to a top-flight sea­son since the 1974-75 sea­son.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors, lan­guish­ing in 15th place in the ta­ble, will take on the</p>
    <p>Tof­fees at Good­i­son Park, with their win­less league run stretch­ing to six matches.</p>
    <p>Arteta’s men have scored just 11 goals in 13 league games – only three clubs have fewer – and their predica­ment is “not good enough” for the club’s stature.</p>
    <p>Speaking at his vir­tual pre­match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, he said: “It could have been a re­ally pos­i­tive year but the re­cent form in the Pre­mier League has taken the gloss off what we have done in the cal­en­dar year.</p>
    <p>“We have to ac­cept the Pre­mier League form in re­cent weeks has not been good enough for this club. It’s been one of the most chal­leng­ing years in the club’s his­tory, for many, many dif­fer­ent rea­sons.</p>
    <p>“I would say the high­lights of the year are the two tro­phies (the Com­mu­nity Shield) we won... the most dis­ap­point­ing is we haven’t had our fans with us to take us through th­ese dif­fi­cult mo­ments.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Arteta said the board knew there would be no “quick fix” when he ar­rived last De­cem­ber to re­place Unai Emery, who was fired a month ear­lier for a near iden­ti­cal aw­ful run.</p>
    <p>In­sist­ing the “project” was long term and that the club’s hi­er­ar­chy was still be­hind him, he said: “At the end of the day, it is the feel­ing that I feel with the staff, with the coach­ing, with the play­ers, which is the most im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“It’s about what chem­istry you have with them, what un­der­stand­ing they have. Do they fol­low you? Do they be­lieve in what you are try­ing to do?”</p>
    <p>Arteta added ev­ery­body at Arse­nal was pulling in the same direction but find­ing sta­bil­ity would take time af­ter a “big shake-up”.</p>
    <p>“We all knew – at least the peo­ple who made the de­ci­sion with me to start this new project – that this was not a quick fix and it was go­ing to take time,” he said.</p>
    <p>But de­spite his pos­i­tiv­ity amid the gloom, Arse­nal’s im­me­di­ate fix­ture list spells dan­ger for a strug­gling side low on con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Ever­ton, they host Manch­ester City in the League Cup and Chelsea in the Pre­mier League, and a poor se­quence of re­sults may see Arteta turfed out.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing played for the blue half of Mersey­side, he is aware of what to­day’s fifth-placed op­po­nents are ca­pa­ble of, es­pe­cially with 2,000 home fans be­hind them.</p>
    <p>“It is al­ways re­ally tough to go to Good­i­son, I played there and know them re­ally well,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They are teams in two dif­fer­ent mo­ments, but we are pre­par­ing the game to go there and beat them be­cause we need a re­sult.”</p>
    <p>With Arse­nal in a weak­ened state, Ever­ton coun­ter­part Carlo Ancelotti is look­ing to twist the knife but em­pathised with Arteta, say­ing yes­ter­day: “Our job is dif­fi­cult and com­pli­cated and there is pres­sure but it is nor­mal.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one has to reach a tar­get, a goal. Arse­nal, maybe has an­other goal from other teams, but it is the same for every man­ager.”</p>
    <p>Arteta will be with­out Granit Xhaka, who is serv­ing the sec­ond of a three-game ban, and Gabriel, who is also sus­pended, while Thomas Partey re­mains side­lined with in­jury.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton will be miss­ing Al­lan, Fabian Delph and James Ro­driguez but Sea­mus Cole­man is back.</p>
