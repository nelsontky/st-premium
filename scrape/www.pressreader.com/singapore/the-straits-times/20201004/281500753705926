    <p>In­fected with Covid-19 and trail­ing in the polls, can US Pres­i­dent Donald Trump con­found the pundits again and se­cure a sec­ond term?</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Un­til Fri­day, analysing how the vote might go a month ahead of Elec­tion Day on Nov 3 was a mat­ter of weigh­ing up the knowns – voter sen­ti­ments, the ef­fects of the pres­i­den­tial de­bate, and his­toric vot­ing pat­terns.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Donald Trump’s pos­i­tive Covid-19 test, how­ever, plunges the pres­i­den­tial race into un­charted ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>“The an­swers you all are look­ing for – how will the Pres­i­dent’s Covid di­ag­no­sis af­fect the race – are not an­swers we’re go­ing to be get­ting to­day, or this week­end,” wrote poll­ster Nate Silver, the founder of elec­tion mod­el­ling web­site FiveThir­tyEight, on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>One thing is sure: The fact that the US Pres­i­dent him­self has been in­fected by the virus puts his han­dling of the pan­demic – his big­gest weak­ness, which he has done his best to down­play – firmly at the fore­front of vot­ers’ minds more than ever.</p>
    <p>“We are now go­ing to be talk­ing about the coro­n­avirus as the top is­sue for the next four weeks,” said Dr Ian Brem­mer, pres­i­dent and founder of po­lit­i­cal risk analysis firm Eura­sia Group and GZero Me­dia. “That’s a big deal, be­cause Pres­i­dent Trump... doesn’t do as well talk­ing about it, he’s not seen to have han­dled it very well.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s coro­n­avirus bombshell comes as Amer­i­cans have en­dured a tu­mul­tuous sum­mer marked by more than 200,000 coro­n­avirus deaths, a bat­tered econ­omy, and a na­tional reck­on­ing over racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>Un­til this twist, most ma­jor elec­tion mod­els had been pre­dict­ing a vic­tory for Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den, but it was far from a fore­gone con­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent’s na­tional lead di­min­ished from dou­ble dig­its to hover around seven points, un­set­tling those who feared a re­peat of Mr Trump’s shock de­feat of Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton, whose lead in bat­tle­ground states shrank to noth­ing in the days lead­ing up to the 2016 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>For Asia, the l at­est un­fold­ing events come amid in­creas­ing geopo­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>The re­gion had al­ready been con­sid­er­ing the ef­fects if Mr Trump were to pull off an­other sur­prise vic­tory in the Elec­toral Col­lege, earn­ing the man­date to con­tinue his “Amer­ica First” for­eign policy of pulling away from mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions, in­ter­na­tional agree­ments and global norms.</p>
    <p>In four years, he has with­drawn the United States from the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship trade deal, the Paris Agree­ment on com­bat­ing cli­mate change, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the Iran nu­clear deal.</p>
    <p>Al­lies and friends of the US have been drawn into its great power com­pe­ti­tion with China, pres­sured to re­ject Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy and de­nounce Chi­nese be­hav­iour, and pressed into pay­ing more for their de­fence.</p>
    <p>If, among all the new un­cer­tain­ties, Mr Trump re­mains a can­di­date and then Pres­i­dent, an­other four years with him at the helm could mean a fur­ther ero­sion of Amer­i­can lead­er­ship on global is­sues that re­quire co­op­er­a­tion, from vac­cine de­vel­op­ment to com­bat­ing cli­mate change, that would be harder to undo.</p>
    <p>“If he wins again, friend and foe alike will ac­cept that the post-World War II pe­riod of Amer­i­can lead­er­ship has come to a de­fin­i­tive end. The ef­fect will vary from coun­try to coun­try,” Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion for­eign policy se­nior fel­low Thomas Wright wrote in an es­say for The At­lantic.</p>
    <p>“All will pre­pare for a world with less co­op­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s path to re­new his White House lease con­tin­ues to evolve.</p>
    <p>To win, can­di­dates need at least 270 of the 538 elec­toral votes held by the na­tion’s 50 states and cap­i­tal. Win­ning a state’s pop­u­lar vote – that is, the most num­ber of votes in that state – nets them all of that state’s elec­toral votes, with small ex­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>This time, as with most Amer­i­can pres­i­den­tial elec­tions, a hand­ful of swing states hold the key.</p>
    <p>Both Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den have been vy­ing hard for the Rust Belt states flipped by Mr Trump in 2016, but where he is now trail­ing.</p>
    <p>These in­clude Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin, as well as Ohio, which no Repub­li­can has ever be­come pres­i­dent with­out win­ning.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den cam­paign also ap­pears to have a real chance of steal­ing Florida, a prized bell­wether state that has cor­rectly cho­sen the even­tual pres­i­dent in 18 out of 20 races since 1932.</p>
    <p>Once again, its 29 elec­toral votes could very well carry ei­ther can­di­date across the thresh­old and into the White House.</p>
    <p>Who do Trump and Bi­den most need?</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign has been dou­bling down on the voter group that pro­pelled him to vic­tory in 2016: white work­ing-class vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Enough of these vot­ers did not turn out to vote in 2016 that boost­ing their turnout this year could pro­pel Mr Trump to vic­tory in the Mid­west, which he won by ra­zor-thin mar­gins.</p>
    <p>He is also seek­ing to stem the loss of sup­port among women and se­niors, and to peel away enough mi­nor­ity vot­ers from Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the Repub­li­can con­ven­tion, Pres­i­dent Trump’s strat­egy for clos­ing the gap be­came clear: in­ten­sify his sup­port among white work­ing-class vot­ers while di­min­ish­ing op­po­si­tion among white sub­ur­ban­ites, es­pe­cially women,” Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion gov­er­nance stud­ies se­nior fel­lows Wil­liam Gal­ston and Elaine Ka­marck wrote in an analysis on the think-tank’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran poll­ster John Zogby told re­porters at a me­dia brief­ing that Mr Trump also seeks to “cre­ate doubts about Bi­den among younger non-white vot­ers that he’s part of the es­tab­lish­ment”, ty­ing the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent to his time in the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion from 2008 to 2016, and ar­gu­ing that those years were not very good for younger vot­ers.</p>
    <p>To these ends, Mr Trump has been paint­ing the Democrats as so­cial­ists to re­gain his lead among older vot­ers, and por­tray­ing them “as the party of chaos, as the party of ri­ot­ing, party of dis­rup­tion” by ty­ing them to the un­rest that has erupted in some protests over racial in­jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Mr Zogby, the founder of polling firm Zogby In­ter­na­tional, said that the gap had nar­rowed be­tween Mr Bi­den and Mr Trump be­cause the Pres­i­dent had re­gained some sup­port from older vot­ers and “safety mums, mothers who are pre­dom­i­nantly in the sub­urbs and white... who are wor­ried about the per­cep­tion of and the re­al­ity of vi­o­lence in the streets”.</p>
    <p>“Now that both sides have had a chance to hone their mes­sage, you’re see­ing that Donald Trump ac­tu­ally is able to score some points on the whole is­sue of law and or­der, on safety and se­cu­rity,” he said.</p>
    <p>As for Mr Bi­den, he needs to re­assem­ble the Obama coali­tion of younger vot­ers, as well as AfricanAme­r­i­can and Latino vot­ers.</p>
    <p>“If Bi­den can bring out the African-Amer­i­can vot­ers in num­bers that Obama was able to but that Hil­lary was not able to, if Bi­den can bring out the sup­port of young women, par­tic­u­larly young white women, the way Obama did, then it could look very good for Joe Bi­den,” said Mr Zogby.</p>
    <p>What does the choice look like now?</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis and on­go­ing hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion has pulled him off the cam­paign trail, re­strict­ing him to vir­tual events he feels healthy enough for.</p>
    <p>This could prove a cru­cial dis­ad­van­tage at a time when Mr Bi­den – who will be able to demon­strate that his strat­egy of wear­ing masks and avoid­ing large crowds was pru­dent – re­turned to the cam­paign trail last week with a multi-stop train tour across the Mid­west.</p>
    <p>More­over, un­like in 2016, when vot­ers who dis­liked both Mr Trump and Mrs Clin­ton went for Mr Trump in the end, those who sim­i­larly dis­ap­prove of both can­di­dates ap­pear to be break­ing for Mr Bi­den this year.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Trump is many things, but ‘safe’ isn’t one of them,” wrote Dr Gal­ston and Dr Ka­marck.</p>
    <p>Much will de­pend on the Pres­i­dent’s med­i­cal con­di­tion over the next few days.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump re­leased a video mes­sage on Fri­day telling Amer­i­cans he was do­ing very well, but if his sit­u­a­tion wors­ens or vot­ers are un­con­vinced, those on the fence and seek­ing a safe op­tion may be spooked into vot­ing for Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Dr Gal­ston and Dr Ka­marck added: “If Repub­li­cans per­suade sub­ur­ban vot­ers that Democrats will not stand up to vi­o­lence and loot­ing, Pres­i­dent Trump could win a come-from-be­hind vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“If Democrats per­suade these vot­ers that Repub­li­cans are try­ing to win the elec­tion with racist dog­whis­tles, the re­sult could be a Bi­den land­slide.”</p>
