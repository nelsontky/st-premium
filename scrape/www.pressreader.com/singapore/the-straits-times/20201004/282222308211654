    <p>Ms Ch­eryl Guo’s pre-pan­demic trips to Bangkok were never com­plete with­out a stop at 7-Eleven to stock up on pre-pack­aged food such as toasted cheese sand­wiches. The 32-year-old dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive would even take along an ex­tra suitcase to buy snacks such as spe­cial Pocky flavours, mush­room chips, tom yam paste and dried mango for fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>Amid the dearth of travel this year, Ms Guo has found a new way to get her fix.</p>
    <p>In May, dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, she launched Sengkang Group Buy (@sen­gkang­group­buy on In­sta­gram) to col­late f ood or­ders from res­i­dents in her es­tate. Neigh­bours split the de­liv­ery fee or pool or­ders to hit the min­i­mum sum for free de­liv­ery to the or­gan­iser’s home, where they col­lect the items.</p>
    <p>Ms Guo, who is mar­ried with no chil­dren, started out or­der­ing from pop­u­lar lo­cal eater­ies. These in­clude pas­tries from Loong Fatt Tau Sar Piah in Balestier, which draws queues of up to an hour, and Brother­bird Milk and Crois­sants, which sells out on­line within min­utes.</p>
    <p>She later branched out to items from overseas, work­ing with im­porters to bring in food such as sand­wiches and pre-cooked bento meals from 7-Eleven in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Ba­nana cakes from Hiap Joo Bak­ery in Jo­hor Baru, kueh lapis from Batam and tai yang bing or malt sugar pas­tries from Tai­wan are other hot favourites brought in by var­i­ous group buys.</p>
    <p>In the past few months, at least 50 es­tate group buys have sprung up is­land­wide as home de­liv­er­ies bur­geoned dur­ing and after the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>These in­clude eight in es­tates such as Bis­han, Bukit Gom­bak and Wood­lands which are af­fil­i­ated with Sengkang Group Buy and op­er­ate in a sim­i­lar way. They do not mark up the price of food but charge a $2 ad­min­is­tra­tive fee for each or­der.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers such as GroupBuysS­G (@groupbuyss­g), which op­er­ates is­land­wide, charge be­tween $5 and $9 for de­liv­er­ies and a $3 ad­min­is­tra­tive fee for self-col­lec­tion by buy­ers liv­ing be­yond the hosts’ es­tate. Self-col­lec­tion for res­i­dents within the same es­tate is free.</p>
    <p>Most or­gan­is­ers have a day job, but some can earn a tidy sum from this side hus­tle.</p>
    <p>Ms Ash­ley Teo, 33, who is self­em­ployed and works in the fi­nance in­dus­try, be­gan co-host­ing Sengkang Group Buy in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>She co­or­di­nates about two or­ders a day, spend­ing about four to five days on it ev­ery al­ter­nate week, and earns about $2,000 a month from this. It helps make up for the short­fall in her main source of in­come, which fell by a third due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Other or­gan­is­ers like GroupBuysS­G founder Winson Lee, 32, see it as a com­mu­nity ini­tia­tive rather than a busi­ness op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee main­tains that he and a team of about five vol­un­teers do not profit from the or­ders they col­lect. De­liv­ery fees go wholly to driv­ers, who have been af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The creative di­rec­tor, who lives in a Hous­ing Board flat in Pasir Ris, launched the group buy in June after com­bin­ing or­ders with his neigh­bours to hit the min­i­mum or­der for de­liv­ery from Tai Cheong Bak­ery, known for its egg tarts.</p>
    <p>When friends and neigh­bours started ask­ing for the next round of or­ders, he re­alised there was a gap in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“We couldn’t be the only ones in Sin­ga­pore with this prob­lem, so I de­cided to of­fer the ser­vice to more com­mu­ni­ties. We want to help as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble or­der food that is in­ac­ces­si­ble to them,” he says.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teers or­gan­ise one or two group buys each week, tak­ing turns to have the food de­liv­ered to their homes. From there, de­liv­ery driv­ers send the food to buy­ers is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>The group re­ceives about 80 or­ders each time, some­times scor­ing bulk dis­counts, which they say they then pass on to cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Be­sides sup­port­ing de­liv­ery driv­ers and small lo­cal busi­nesses, so­ci­ol­o­gists say these group buys are a way to fos­ter kam­pung spirit in an in­creas­ingly dis­con­nected world.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan Ern Ser, an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, says: “Through reg­u­lar in­ter­ac­tions, neigh­bours would likely get to know one an­other bet­ter and dis­cover more com­mon in­ter­ests, thereby form­ing so­cial ties and a so­cial net­work within the es­tate.”</p>
    <p>Such mu­tual sup­port from a close-knit com­mu­nity can help mem­bers ride out a cri­sis such as the cur­rent pan­demic, he adds.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Queen­stown group buy or­gan­iser Tan Jie Min, 36, says the chief perk is that “hi-bye in­ter­ac­tions have be­come real con­ver­sa­tions”. The re­tail in­dus­try ex­ec­u­tive started host­ing group buys in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Ms Teo of Sengkang Group Buy notes that a sense of com­mu­nity has taken root in the What­sApp groups she runs. Be­sides talk­ing about food and dis­cussing what to or­der next, mem­bers seek help for ev­ery­thing from handy­man con­tacts to places for good duri­ans.</p>
    <p>While new hosts have sprouted up across the is­land, group buys in es­tates such as Sengkang and Pung­gol, with a younger de­mo­graphic, tend to see more de­mand. Hosts say res­i­dents there are more likely to keep abreast of food trends and ap­pre­ci­ate the con­ve­nience of lunchtime hawker de­liv­er­ies as they largely work from home.</p>
    <p>In the mature es­tate of Queen­stown, for in­stance, Ms Tan hosts one to two group buys ev­ery day and gets about 10 or­ders each time.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, group buys in nearby Telok Blan­gah re­ceive an av­er­age of 50 or­ders – many of which come from young par­ents or</p>
    <p>I be­lieve group buys are go­ing to be­come a way of life as peo­ple har­ness the power of group sav­ings and min­imise waste by not or­der­ing too much to hit the min­i­mum spend on their own.</p>
    <p>cou­ples with­out chil­dren.</p>
    <p>For some, group pur­chases have re­placed home-cooked meals and even trips to the gro­cery store.</p>
    <p>Mrs Wendy Tan, who lives in Sengkang, got hooked on the con­ve­nience of group buys dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and now makes about seven to 10 or­ders of food, fruit and desserts ev­ery week.</p>
    <p>“Even though we are now able to go out, we have be­come ac­cus­tomed to hav­ing food de­liv­ered after do­ing it for so many months,” says the ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant, 43, who has no chil­dren.</p>
    <p>For mother-of-three Sylvia Ng, 46, weekly food de­liv­er­ies from GroupBuysS­G have be­come a wel­come pick-me-up for her hus­band and three chil­dren, aged be­tween 10 and 16.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the week, it is nice to give our­selves a treat with food that I don’t have to make a de­tour or queue up spe­cially to buy,” says the mar­ket­ing man­ager, who lives in Pasir Ris. She has pur­chased items such as ba­nana cake from Hiap Joo Bak­ery and kueh from Ah Yee’s Soon Kueh in Joo Chiat.</p>
    <p>Even as more re­turn to the of­fice, de­mand from cus­tomers re­mains healthy. Sengkang Group Buy, which has three full What­sApp groups com­pris­ing about 750 mem­bers in to­tal, has a wait­list of hope­fuls want­ing to join. Its hosts do not in­tend to open a fourth chat group lest they are un­able to cope with the spi­ralling de­mand.</p>
    <p>And Mr Lee of GroupBuysS­G be­lieves that this trend is here to stay.</p>
    <p>He says: “I be­lieve group buys are go­ing to be­come a way of life as peo­ple har­ness the power of group sav­ings and min­imise waste by not or­der­ing too much to hit the min­i­mum spend on their own.”</p>
