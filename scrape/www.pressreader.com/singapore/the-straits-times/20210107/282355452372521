    <p>TOKYO • The or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee of the de­layed Tokyo Olympics and Par­a­lympics has trained 220 IT se­cu­rity ex­perts or so-called white-hat hack­ers to pro­tect the Games from cy­ber at­tacks.</p>
    <p>The “eth­i­cal hack­ers” now work­ing for the or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee are mostly em­ploy­ees of Ja­panese multi­na­tional con­glom­er­ates, in­clud­ing NTT and NEC.</p>
    <p>They have un­der­gone an ex­ten­sive train­ing pro­gramme on the as­sump­tion the Olympics’ open­ing cer­e­mony, due to be held on July 23, could be dis­rupted by cy­ber at­tacks, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The Pyeongchan­g Win­ter Games in 2018 fell vic­tim to a cy­ber at­tack and suf­fered sys­tem prob­lems on the day of the open­ing cer­e­mony, which forced South Korean or­gan­is­ers to make changes to the pro­gramme. There were also dis­rup­tions to In­ter­net ac­cess and broad­cast­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Last year, the US Jus­tice Depart­ment charged six Russian mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cers in con­nec­tion with in­ter­na­tional hack­ing, ac­cus­ing them of world­wide cy­ber at­tacks that in­cluded tar­get­ing the Pyeongchan­g Games.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has also said Rus­sia’s mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence ser­vice has car­ried out cy­ber at­tacks against the or­gan­is­ers of the Tokyo Olympics and other as­so­ci­ated en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>As part of ef­forts to en­sure a suc­cess­ful Olympics, the cy­ber se­cu­rity train­ing con­sisted of lec­tures on 20 sub­jects and ex­er­cises, where mem­bers were di­vided into groups to pro­tect their sys­tem from at­tacks of other teams.</p>
    <p>In a bid to pro­tect crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture, such as elec­tric­ity and trans­porta­tion sys­tems, teams of cy­ber se­cu­rity ex­perts have also been estab­lished in their re­spec­tive fields to share in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has brought about in­creased dif­fi­cul­ties. Since many of­fi­cials work­ing for the Tokyo Games have been telecom­mut­ing, there has been grow­ing con­cern that de­vices be­ing used to work from home will be tar­geted.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the Tokyo Games may limit spec­ta­tor num­bers,</p>
    <p>which in­creases the de­mand for events to be streamed. But the au­thor­i­ties have vowed to over­come the hur­dles.</p>
    <p>“The Games them­selves will be in cy­berspace. The host coun­try has the re­spon­si­bil­ity to share (them) with the world,” a Ja­panese gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial said.</p>
