    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Hokkien Huay Kuan (SHHK) has do­nated $1.8 mil­lion to the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy (SIT) to sup­port the univer­sity’s new cam­pus in the up­com­ing Pung­gol Dig­i­tal District.</p>
    <p>The clan as­so­ci­a­tion’s pres­i­dent Tan Cheng Gay pre­sented a cheque yes­ter­day to the SIT pres­i­dent, Pro­fes­sor Tan Thiam Soon, dur­ing an event to cel­e­brate the SHHK’s 180th an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Man­darin, Mr Tan said the do­na­tion, made through the clan as­so­ci­a­tion’s Hokkien Foun­da­tion char­ity arm, is in line with the SHHK’s phi­los­o­phy of sup­port­ing the com­mu­nity and fund­ing ed­u­ca­tion since its found­ing.</p>
    <p>Suc­ces­sive lead­ers of the clan as­so­ci­a­tion have al­ways be­lieved that “to have knowl­edge is to have the fu­ture”, Mr Tan added.</p>
    <p>In recog­ni­tion of the do­na­tion, SIT has named a lec­ture the­atre at its cur­rent Dover cam­pus after the clan as­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>When its new Pung­gol cam­pus opens in 2023, it will also un­veil the Sin­ga­pore Hokkien Huay Kuan Col­lab­o­ra­tion Loop, a net­work of el­e­vated pedes­trian walk­ways and bridges con­nect­ing the univer­sity’s aca­demic blocks and other ac­tiv­ity hubs.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the event, which was held at the SHHK Cul­tural Acad­emy and live-streamed on Face­book, the SHHK also an­nounced that it will give sup­port grants to</p>
    <p>talling $205,500 to 411 needy stu­dents – seven chil­dren of SHHK staff and mem­bers and 404 stu­dents from its af­fil­i­ated schools.</p>
    <p>The stu­dents will each re­ceive a $500 grant to help their fam­i­lies cope with the Covid-19 pandemic. This is on top of the ex­ist­ing an­nual bur­saries they are get­ting from the Hokkien Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, who was the guest of hon­our at the event, also launched a com­mem­o­ra­tive book trac­ing the SHHK’s 180-year his­tory ti­tled Tran­scend­ing Cen­turies, a com­pi­la­tion of me­dia ar­ti­cles and es­says about the clan as­so­ci­a­tion and its as­so­ci­ated en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Con­grat­u­lat­ing the SHHK on its an­niver­sary, PM Lee noted that the clan as­so­ci­a­tion has evolved to­gether with Sin­ga­pore over the years. “To be able to adapt to the chang­ing en­vi­ron­ment and keep the Huay Kuan thriving, that is an ex­cep­tional achieve­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>PM Lee added that the SHHK has em­braced Sin­ga­pore’s unique mul­tira­cial and mul­ti­cul­tural iden­tity by not only look­ing after Hokkien and Chi­nese Sin­ga­pore­ans, but also pro­vid­ing sup­port to Sin­ga­pore­ans of other races.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong also at­tended the event as a spe­cial guest. Mr Tong, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law, took over as chair­man of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nity Liaison Group from Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The group is tasked with strength­en­ing the Gov­ern­ment’s re­la­tion­ship with Chi­nese com­mu­nity or­gan­i­sa­tions and deep­en­ing its un­der­stand­ing of the Chi­nese com­mu­nity.</p>
