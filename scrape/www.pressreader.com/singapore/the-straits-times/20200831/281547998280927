    <p>In­dia re­ported 78,761 new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, the high­est daily jump in in­fec­tions re­ported by any coun­try since the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic, as the global tally soared past 25 mil­lion. As cases spi­ral, coun­tries fur­ther tight­ened re­stric­tions to try and rein in the spread of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>In­dia has crossed a new som­bre mile­stone with a daily spike of 78,761 fresh coro­n­avirus cases within a 24-hour win­dow. This is the high­est sin­gle-day jump in Covid-19 in­fec­tions re­ported by any coun­try since the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­dia has now recorded a to­tal of more than 3.5 mil­lion cases, mov­ing it closer to Brazil’s 3.8 mil­lion fig­ure. The Latin Amer­i­can coun­try, which recorded 41,350 cases on Saturday, ranks sec­ond in the list of coun­tries af­fected by the virus. The United States has more than 6.1 mil­lion cases, with 42,843 fresh cases recorded on Saturday.</p>
    <p>The three worst-hit coun­tries con­tinue to chalk up mas­sive in­fec­tion num­bers ev­ery day, and are largely re­spon­si­ble for the global tally soar­ing past the 25 mil­lion mark yes­ter­day as coun­tries fur­ther tight­ened re­stric­tions to try and rein in the bil­low­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­dia, which has been record­ing more than 75,000 cases daily since last Thurs­day, in­stead chose to fur­ther re­lax its lock­down re­stric­tions. It will al­low metro ser­vices, which have re­mained shut since March, to re­sume oper­a­tions from next Mon­day and gave the go-ahead for so­cial func­tions with a max­i­mum gath­er­ing of 100 per­sons from Sept 21.</p>
    <p>“Starting metro ser­vices is a huge risk given the spikes we have recorded,” said Dr M.C. Misra, the former di­rec­tor of the All In­dia In­sti­tute of Med­i­cal Sci­ences, a top govern­ment hos­pi­tal in Delhi.</p>
    <p>“So­cial gath­er­ings should have been avoided be­cause of the large num­ber of asymp­to­matic in­di­vid­u­als who may pass it on to oth­ers,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>There are also fears In­dia will record more pos­i­tive cases as test­ing rates go up. More than 1.05 mil­lion tests were con­ducted across the coun­try on Saturday, the high­est ever in a sin­gle day for In­dia.</p>
    <p>This fig­ure was 525,689 at the start of the month.</p>
    <p>“What­ever spike we are see­ing to­day is de­spite the fact that not every­body car­ry­ing the virus has been tested. The num­ber of ac­tual in­fec­tions could be dou­ble, triple or 10 times,” Dr Misra added, re­fer­ring to re­cent sero-sur­veys that in­di­cate wide­spread asymp­to­matic in­fec­tions in some In­dian cities such as Mumbai and Delhi. A sero-sur­vey is con­ducted by test­ing blood serum drawn from a sam­ple of peo­ple in a com­mu­nity to de­tect an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>De­spite the wor­ry­ing spread of the pan­demic that has en­gulfed even In­dia’s ru­ral ar­eas, govern­ment of­fi­cials have high­lighted the fall­ing fa­tal­ity rate – cur­rently at 1.79 per cent of all cases – as well as the present re­cov­ery rate of 76.61 per cent to de­fend their han­dling of the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>An Agence France-Presse re­port yes­ter­day said that a mil­lion ad­di­tional cases have been de­tected glob­ally roughly ev­ery four days since the mid­dle of last month, with coun­tries such as New Zealand and South Korea that had brought their out­breaks largely un­der con­trol now bat­tling new clus­ters.</p>
    <p>The re­port added that masks will be manda­tory from to­day on pub­lic trans­port and flights in New Zealand.</p>
    <p>While the num­ber of daily new cases in South Korea fell below 300 yes­ter­day for the first time in five days, the Yon­hap news agency said the num­ber of daily virus cases has re­mained in the triple dig­its for more than two weeks, and may rise again as new clus­ters have been emerg­ing in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>Tougher so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures have been ex­tended in the greater Seoul area for one more week and curbs im­posed on restau­rants, bak­eries and fran­chise cof­fee chains in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, to­day marks the cut-off date for coun­tries to sub­mit their ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est to par­tic­i­pate in the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s global Covax ini­tia­tive that seeks to en­sure a Covid-19 vac­cine is avail­able world­wide to both higher-in­come and lower-in­come coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It aims to of­fer two bil­lion vac­cine doses by the end of next year equally to all par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries. But it has strug­gled to find full sup­port from some of the more wealthy coun­tries. The US, Bri­tain, Ja­pan and the Euro­pean Union have struck their own deals to se­cure ac­cess to a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>One by one, nine es­tab­lish­ments around Mr K. Ra­mamoor­thy’s In­ter­net cafe in Up­per Dick­son Road have shut­tered, and he fears his might be next.</p>
    <p>These busi­nesses, which in­clude money chang­ers and tex­tile shops, could not cope with the lack of cus­tomers due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, said the 75-year-old.</p>
    <p>His busi­ness at An­tech In­ter­net Cafe has plunged by about 90 per cent.</p>
    <p>“What can I do? We are al­most go­ing to have to close soon be­cause there are no tourists or for­eign work­ers to pay us,” said Mr Ra­mamoor­thy, whose cafe also pro­vides doc­u­ment pro­cess­ing and scan­ning ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s bor­ders re­main largely shut to vis­i­tors, with the ex­cep­tion of some from a few coun­tries.</p>
    <p>And most mi­grant work­ers at dor­mi­to­ries re­main con­fined to their quar­ters out­side of go­ing to work due to mea­sures to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This has been bad news for Lit­tle In­dia, where busi­nesses rely heav­ily on these two groups to keep go­ing.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times vis­ited the area yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, there were no crowds, with staff out­num­ber­ing cus­tomers in some restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle In­dia used to be bustling on week­ends, but shop­keep­ers said the lively at­mos­phere has dis­ap­peared.</p>
    <p>A shop at­ten­dant at a jew­ellery store in Seran­goon Road said the sit­u­a­tion is es­pe­cially bad on week­days, when cus­tomers have be­come “a rare sight”.</p>
    <p>“It is so quiet nowa­days, it feels like it is a com­pletely dif­fer­ent place. I have never seen any­thing like this,” she said.</p>
    <p>In a bid to en­tice cus­tomers, Mr Ro­hit Be­hera, man­ager of pop­u­lar restau­rant Madras New Wood­lands in Up­per Dick­son Road, said he and his team have rolled out as many mea­sures as pos­si­ble to en­sure din­ers feel safe.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant has in­stalled a hands-free tem­per­a­ture-tak­ing sta­tion, de­mar­cated ar­eas to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing and pro­vided hand sani­tiser for cus­tomers to use.</p>
    <p>Mr Be­hera said his restau­rant has seen a 50 per cent drop in busi­ness com­pared with pre-Covid-19 times, but he hopes that the safety mea­sures will draw cus­tomers back.</p>
    <p>“If they see that our place is safe to eat at, they will eat here again, and we can sur­vive even though there are not many tourists here any­more,” he said.</p>
    <p>In May, the Sin­ga­pore In­dian Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try (SICCI) set up a task force to help busi­nesses in Lit­tle In­dia af­fected by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The SICCI said on its Face­book page that it held a walk­a­bout in the area on Saturday and plans to reach out to about 300 busi­nesses by the end of next month to spread the word about the var­i­ous schemes and sup­port mea­sures they can tap.</p>

There are fears that In&#xAD;dia will record more pos&#xAD;i&#xAD;tive cases as test&#xAD;ing rates go up.&#xD;&#xA;More than 1.05 mil&#xAD;lion tests were con&#xAD;ducted across the coun&#xAD;try on Saturday, the high&#xAD;est ever in a sin&#xAD;gle day for In&#xAD;dia.</p>
