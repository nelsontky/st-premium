    <p>Malls in Sin­ga­pore have fallen silent this fes­tive sea­son, when vol­un­teers from The Sal­va­tion Army usu­ally ring bells to so­licit pub­lic do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>The fa­mil­iar red ket­tles used for The Sal­va­tion Army’s an­nual fundraiser, known as Christ­mas Ket­tling, can still be found at se­lected shop­ping cen­tres, but they are un­manned due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic can drop cash into the ket­tle pots or scan the QR code on them to make a do­na­tion. They can also give on­line at christ­mas­ket­tling.sg.</p>
    <p>But the char­ity says that hav­ing no bells for this Christ­mas fundraiser will have a dev­as­tat­ing im­pact on its abil­ity to serve its needy ben­e­fi­cia­ries next year.</p>
    <p>The Sal­va­tion Army’s chief sec­re­tary, Lieu­tenant-Colonel Hary Haran, says that due to the Covid-19 eco­nomic cli­mate and re­stric­tions on vol­un­teers, it ex­pects Christ­mas Ket­tling do­na­tions to drop by about 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>GET­TING CRE­ATIVE</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tion­ally a time of fes­tive giv­ing and vol­un­teerism, Christ­mas has dimmed for some char­i­ties fac­ing a short­fall in fund-rais­ing and vol­un­teers due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions are find­ing new ways to over­come the con­straints of so­cial dis­tanc­ing, which means year-end events – like cor­po­rate din­ner-and-dances, when com­pa­nies of­ten make do­na­tions to char­i­ties of their choice – can no longer take place.</p>
    <p>Char­ity staff, vol­un­teers and donors are de­ter­mined to rein­vent their modus operandi where nec­es­sary to en­sure ben­e­fi­cia­ries still get a Christ­mas filled with cheer.</p>
    <p>Ms Michelle Eu, head of com­mu­nity part­ner­ship at char­ity AWWA, says donors and vol­un­teers con­tinue to be sup­port­ive de­spite the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“At this time of the year, peo­ple are think­ing about how to bring Christ­mas cheer to our clients. We’ve had a lot of in­quiries from cor­po­rates, in­di­vid­u­als and schools. We’ve also had to in­no­vate and get more cre­ative about what we can do.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, one com­pany AWWA works with has spon­sored 25 chil­dren with spe­cial needs to join fes­tive ac­tiv­i­ties such as meet­ing “Santa” on­line, the char­ity’s first such vir­tual meet-and-greet.</p>
    <p>While sea­sonal vol­un­teerism has fallen, Mr Alain Chen, 20, finds it as worth­while as ever.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen, who is wait­ing to en­ter univer­sity next year, has been vol­un­teer­ing since Se­condary 1 with the an­nual Boys’ Brigade Share-aGift project, orig­i­nally as a mem­ber of the Boys’ Brigade in school. He re­cently de­liv­ered some vouch­ers to ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the project.</p>
    <p>He says: “We can­not talk to ben­e­fi­cia­ries as much as we usu­ally do, but be­ing able to meet them face to face is still very mean­ing­ful.”</p>
    <p>This year, Boys’ Brigade Share-aGift seeks to sup­port about 41,400 ben­e­fi­cia­ries through dis­tribut­ing gro­cery vouch­ers and ful­fill­ing Christ­mas wishes for ben­e­fi­cia­ries, who typ­i­cally ask for items for daily use like rice cook­ers.</p>
    <p>Boys’ Brigade standees with PayNow op­tions for e-pay­ment can be found at 145 FairPrice stores. Do­na­tions can also be made on­line at www.bb­share.sg.</p>
    <p>Since school­boys are not al­lowed to take part in the do­na­tion drive this year due to Covid-19, there has been a more than ten­fold drop in vol­un­teers from about 5,700 for pre-Covid-19 Christ­mases to 530 now, says Mr Henry Tan, who chairs the project.</p>
    <p>He adds that they have reached only 46 per cent of the to­tal do­na­tions sought, which he at­tributes to the lack of vol­un­teer pres­ence on the ground.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 forc­ing many in­ter­ac­tions to go on­line, char­i­ties have had to adapt to vir­tual vol­un­teer­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Joyce Teng, com­mu­nity en­gage­ment and part­ner­ships di­rec­tor at Sin­ga­pore Chil­dren’s So­ci­ety, says that given lower phys­i­cal en­gage­ment, the so­ci­ety has taken this op­por­tu­nity to pro­vide monthly train­ing ses­sions for vol­un­teers via Zoom on top­ics such as per­sonal data pro­tec­tion and teach­ing pre-school­ers to pro­tect them­selves from sex­ual abuse.</p>
    <p>The char­ity sec­tor also shares some of the strug­gles of the bad­ly­hit re­tail in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Ms Jace­lyn Lim, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Autism Re­source Cen­tre (Sin­ga­pore), says: “As a char­ity, it’s im­por­tant for us to keep our­selves rel­e­vant and we were forced to step up our e-com­merce.”</p>
    <p>The cen­tre runs a so­cial en­ter­prise, The Art Fac­ulty, which helps artists on the autism spec­trum earn roy­al­ties through the sale of art­works and mer­chan­dise.</p>
    <p>To up its Christ­mas game, The Art Fac­ulty has launched a Se­cret Santa pro­gramme to ar­range, co­or­di­nate and de­liver pur­chases made through its on­line store.</p>
    <p>This year’s ban on large Christ­mas par­ties is sorely felt in Chen Su Lan Methodist Chil­dren’s Home, says the home’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Low Kee Hong.</p>
    <p>The res­i­den­tial home for chil­dren, who typ­i­cally come from bro­ken fam­i­lies, is usu­ally abuzz with year-end ac­tiv­i­ties that serve as “morale boost­ers and pro­vide a sense of belonging”, he says. These in­clude a camp and campfire as well as a Christ­mas con­cert, where the chil­dren look for­ward to per­form­ing for their par­ents.</p>
    <p>This year, ac­tiv­i­ties have to be con­fined to smaller groups in in­di­vid­ual dor­mi­to­ries, which are di­vided by gen­der and age. The home now has 65 res­i­dents, who range from eight to 21 years of age.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren are dec­o­rat­ing their own dor­mi­to­ries, which have a Christ­mas tree each. In small groups, they will be putting on singing, danc­ing and other video per­for­mances that the whole home can watch via Zoom while en­joy­ing so­cially dis­tanced fes­tive meals.</p>
    <p>With no in­ter­min­gling among dor­mi­to­ries and con­straints on group sizes for out­ings, the staff have had to “stretch their imag­i­na­tion” to en­sure the chil­dren have a good Christ­mas and year-end hol­i­day, Mr Low says.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the staff re­cently or­gan­ised eight small group out­ings to Ma­rina Bar­rage, an en­deav­our that could have been one big ex­cur­sion be­fore Covid-19.</p>
    <p>GEN­ER­OUS SUP­PORT</p>
    <p>The chal­lenges of hav­ing Christ­mas un­der Covid-19 are re­flec­tive of the wider chal­lenges that char­i­ties faced this year. But the sil­ver lin­ing, these non-prof­its say, is the re­li­able gen­eros­ity of donors and vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ben­jamin Wil­liam, sec­re­tary­gen­eral and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Sin­ga­pore Red Cross, says: “The num­ber of ben­e­fi­cia­ries that have ap­proached us has in­creased and we’ve had to in­crease our sup­port for them.”</p>
    <p>The needs thrown into the spot­light by job and in­come losses dur­ing the pan­demic are con­sid­er­able.</p>
    <p>“Over the last few months, we’ve sup­ported close to 1,000 ex­tra fam­i­lies. We reg­u­larly sup­port about 150 eco­nom­i­cally chal­lenged fam­i­lies monthly,” says Mr Wil­liam.</p>
    <p>This Christ­mas, as with Hari Raya and Deep­avali ear­lier in the year, the Sin­ga­pore Red Cross will be dis­tribut­ing more care pack­ages to vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple, which could in­clude items such as dried food, soap or adult di­a­pers, de­pend­ing on what the house­hold needs. This is to “soften the blow” for bread­win­ners who may be spend­ing more for fes­tive oc­ca­sions, he says.</p>
    <p>De­spite such chal­lenges, he is op­ti­mistic that the Sin­ga­pore Red Cross, which has ben­e­fited from Covid-19 re­lief schemes like gov­ern­ment sup­port for jobs, can con­tinue to sup­port the needy.</p>
    <p>He says: “What most of us are wor­ried about is the sit­u­a­tion next year.”</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies who are ben­e­fit­ing from Covid-19 as­sis­tance schemes this year may find it harder to do­nate next year, as may the man in the street, if the pan­demic drags on.</p>
    <p>But this year at least, some char­i­ties have even seen an in­crease in fund-rais­ing.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF), which pro­vides pocket money for chil­dren in low-in­come fam­i­lies, has seen cor­po­rate and in­di­vid­ual do­na­tions in­crease by about 70 per cent, says the fund’s gen­eral man­ager Tan Bee Heong.</p>
    <p>STSPMF has also rid­den on the ris­ing de­mand for stay­ca­tions to raise funds, ty­ing up with Or­chard Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore for its Ot­ter Fam­ily Ad­ven­ture stay­ca­tion pack­age, which in­cludes an ot­ter plush toy. For ev­ery pack­age bought this Christ­mas, $20 will go to STSPMF.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan says: “We’ve re­ceived very gen­er­ous do­na­tions and sup­port from the pub­lic. Peo­ple are more will­ing to help dur­ing this pan­demic.”</p>
