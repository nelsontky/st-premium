    <p>FIGHT FOR OUR VOTE</p>
    <p>To­day is sup­pos­edly our vot­ing day, we need to re­sist to fight back for ’’ our vote.</p>
    <p>MADAM WONG, 70, a demon­stra­tor.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG • Po­lice fired rounds of pep­per balls at pro­test­ers in Hong Kong yes­ter­day as hun­dreds took to the streets to demon­strate against the post­pone­ment of leg­isla­tive elec­tions and a new na­tional se­cu­rity law im­posed by China.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said they ar­rested at least 298 peo­ple, mainly for il­le­gal gath­er­ings, in a no­tice on their Face­book page.</p>
    <p>In July, Hong Kong leader Car­rie</p>
    <p>Lam post­poned the Sept 6 elec­tion for seats in the Asian fi­nan­cial hub’s Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil for a year be­cause of a spike in coron­avirus cases. The move dealt a blow to the pro-democ­racy op­po­si­tion who hoped to win a his­toric ma­jor­ity in the coun­cil, where only half the seats are di­rectly elected and the other half are ap­pointed mem­bers who mostly sup­port Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“To­day is sup­pos­edly our vot­ing day, we need to re­sist to fight back for our vote,” said a 70-year-old woman sur­named Wong as she marched with other pro­test­ers.</p>
    <p>The vote would have been the for­mer Bri­tish colony’s first of­fi­cial elec­tion since Bei­jing im­posed new se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion in late June.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment in­sists the de­lay had no po­lit­i­cal mo­tive.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of po­lice were sta­tioned around the bustling Kowloon penin­sula as marchers waved plac­ards and chanted pop­u­lar anti-gov­ern­ment slo­gans such as “lib­er­ate Hong Kong”.</p>
    <p>These slo­gans are now banned un­der the new se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral well-known ac­tivists were ar­rested, in­clud­ing Civil Hu­man Rights Front vice-con­venor Figo Chan and for­mer leg­is­la­tor Le­ung Kwok Hung, also known as “Long Hair”, ac­cord­ing to a post on Chan’s Face­book page.</p>
    <p>Hours be­fore the protest, the po­lice ar­rested ra­dio DJ Tam Tak Chi, an­other democ­racy ac­tivist, for “ut­ter­ing sedi­tious words” – a colo­nial era of­fence.</p>
    <p>Anti-gov­ern­ment demon­stra­tions have de­clined this year mainly be­cause of lim­its on group gath­er­ings, im­posed to counter the spread of Covid-19, and the se­cu­rity law, which pun­ishes ac­tions that China sees as sub­ver­sive, se­ces­sion­ist, ter­ror­ist or col­lu­sions with for­eign forces.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics say the law aims to quash dis­sent in the city, while sup­port­ers say it will bring more sta­bil­ity af­ter a year of of­ten-vi­o­lent anti-gov­ern­ment and anti-China un­rest.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong re­turned to Chi­nese rule in 1997 un­der a guar­an­tee of au­ton­omy but crit­ics say the new law un­der­mines that promise and puts the ter­ri­tory on a more au­thor­i­tar­ian path.</p>
    <p>Ad­vo­cates of the law say it plugs loop­holes in na­tional se­cu­rity left by the city’s in­abil­ity to ful­fil a con­sti­tu­tional re­quire­ment to pass such laws on its own.</p>
    <p>While street protests have largely lost their mo­men­tum, anti-gov­ern­ment and anti-Bei­jing sen­ti­ment per­sists, with China’s of­fer of mass coron­avirus test­ing for Hong Kong res­i­dents prompt­ing calls for a boy­cott amid pub­lic dis­trust.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have cited coron­avirus fears in their moves to re­strict gath­er­ings, which are cur­rently lim­ited to two peo­ple, and the po­lice have re­jected ap­pli­ca­tions for protests in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong has re­ported around 4,800 coron­avirus cases since Jan­uary, far lower than in other ma­jor cities around the world. The num­ber of new daily in­fec­tions has fallen sub­stan­tially from triple dig­its in July to sin­gle dig­its cur­rently.</p>
