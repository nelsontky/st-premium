    <p>PARIS • Whether in Paris, Kuala Lumpur or Cal­i­for­nia, gig econ­omy work­ers fear they can no longer sur­vive on mea­gre earn­ings from jobs that leave them in­creas­ingly vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>The term “gig” stretches back a cen­tury to jazz mu­si­cians who used it to re­fer to a one-off show, but now the “gig econ­omy” in­volves mil­lions of peo­ple in all sorts of jobs, from Uber driv­ers to De­liv­eroo de­liv­ery teams.</p>
    <p>AL­GO­RITHM SLAVES</p>
    <p>Mr Wis­sem Inal does more than 700km a week on his scooter, de­liv­er­ing up to 10 take­out meals in the Paris sub­urbs every evening.</p>
    <p>“At the mo­ment, with the lock­down, I end up with €500 (S$810) a month net,” said the 32-year-old who has driven for De­liv­eroo since 2017 but also takes jobs for Uber Eats and Stu­art.</p>
    <p>Mr Inal has trou­ble see­ing the “good side” of his job at the mo­ment, and crit­i­cises cal­cu­la­tions by De­liv­eroo’s al­go­rithm that de­cide how much to of­fer him for jobs.</p>
    <p>“A de­liv­ery that’s worth €6 at noon is worth just €3 in the evening. You can’t earn a liv­ing with this job, un­less you’re will­ing to live like a slave.” He re­cently joined an as­so­ci­a­tion of gig de­liv­ery driv­ers that seeks to im­prove work­ing con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>“We should be able to de­fend our­selves,” he main­tains.</p>
    <p>FLEX­I­BIL­ITY OR ON DE­MAND?</p>
    <p>When Ms Erica Mighetto be­gan driving with Lyft three years ago, “I just loved it”, she said.</p>
    <p>Her grown son had left the house and she thought it would be a great move un­til she found a job in book­keep­ing or prop­erty man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally en­joyed, you know, choos­ing my own hours,” she told Agence France-Presse (AFP). “I thought life was good.” Ms Mighetto lived in Sacra­mento but would drive more than an hour to the San Fran­cisco area on week­ends be­cause there was more work in the richer towns.</p>
    <p>She slept in her car or shelled out US$25 (S$33) for a room.</p>
    <p>Ms Mighetto was pulling i n US$60 to US$80 an hour be­fore ex­penses in 2017, but a se­ries of rate cuts caused that to fall to US$20 at the be­gin­ning of the year and to less than US$10 in March.</p>
    <p>She finds the al­go­rithms opaque and per­ni­cious.</p>
    <p>“So it knows me per­son­ally,” said Ms Mighetto. “And the bonus of­fers were changed, you know, based on what I was will­ing to ac­cept.” If friends were get­ting bonus of­fers of US$50 for do­ing 20 rides per week, the al­go­rithm would of­fer her US$350 – but for 120 rides a week.</p>
    <p>To get enough jobs and claim the bonus, driv­ers would ac­cept lower fees.</p>
    <p>“You’re in this, like, vi­cious cir­cle black hole,” said Ms Mighetto.</p>
    <p>She does not buy the ar­gu­ment that gig work is flex­i­ble. “I per­son­ally call it on-de­mand work...</p>
    <p>there’s no flex­i­bil­ity – you have to work when there’s de­mand. You’re go­ing to work late nights, long week­ends and every sin­gle hol­i­day.”</p>
    <p>In the spring, she gave up driving for fear of catching Covid-19, but had to fight for un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits of US$450 per week in­stead of the US$167 paid to gig work­ers.</p>
    <p>She re­ceived a US$600 per week sup­ple­men­tal fed­eral ben­e­fit that the United States in­tro­duced as part of its Covid-19 stim­u­lus mea­sures, but it ran out af­ter four months.</p>
    <p>Ms Mighetto is bit­ter about a Cal­i­for­nia ref­er­en­dum – backed by</p>
    <p>Uber – to over­turn a state law that would have forced gig firms to recog­nise their driv­ers as em­ploy­ees, and pay them min­i­mum wages and ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia vot­ers ap­proved the mea­sure with 58 per cent of the vote.</p>
    <p>“We shouldn’t be strip­ping work­ers of ba­sic labour pro­tec­tions so peo­ple can get cheap rides,” she said.</p>
    <p>JUG­GLE THE PLAT­FORMS</p>
    <p>Twenty-seven-year-old Devon Gutekunst de­liv­ers for DoorDash, which just took in al­most US$3.4 bil­lion in its stock mar­ket de­but.</p>
    <p>His smart­phone of­fers him a job – US$5.50 for a 7.4km de­liv­ery in 30 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“That’s the equiv­a­lent of US$11 an hour, that’s too lit­tle,” said Mr Gutekunst.</p>
    <p>“My per­sonal min­i­mum is US$18 an hour. I of­ten make more than that, be­cause I have a strat­egy.” Part of it is to be se­lec­tive and fo­cus on west­ern Los Angeles and the beach towns of Ma­rina Del Rey and Santa Mon­ica.</p>
    <p>But mostly, it con­sists of play­ing different plat­forms off against one another.</p>
    <p>Mr Gutekunst’s job ac­cep­tance rate for DoorDash was 12 per cent that day, but he said it can of­ten be just 2 per cent.</p>
    <p>“To make de­cent money... you re­ally have to jug­gle, to play with all the of­fers to make your liv­ing.”</p>
    <p>US$27 (S$36) FOR 14-HOUR SHIFT IN MALAYSIA</p>
    <p>Mr Amal Fahmi, 24, keeps his eye glued to his cell­phone and the Grab de­liv­ery app pop­u­lar in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>He is one of many Malaysians who make a liv­ing de­liv­er­ing food, med­i­ca­tion and shop­ping by mo­tor­cy­cle in Petaling Jaya, an af­flu­ent sub­urb of Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Covid-19 hit, he was a driver for Grab in Jo­hor, south­ern Malaysia.</p>
    <p>“I could eas­ily make a com­fort­able liv­ing. But af­ter the virus out­break, life be­came tough as many peo­ple lost their jobs and my in­come was re­duced,” Mr Amal told AFP as he waited out­side a depart­ment store for his ninth or­der of the day.</p>
    <p>Given the bleak prospects in Jo­hor, he headed to the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“There were no job op­por­tu­ni­ties in my home town as I lack aca­demic qual­i­fi­ca­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Amal earns a lit­tle more than US$700 a month if he puts in long hours. That day, he reached his daily av­er­age of US$27 af­ter a gru­elling 14 hours.</p>
    <p>“Look around, there are so many of us do­ing de­liv­ery. It is get­ting tough,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Amal would pre­fer a steady job, but does not com­pletely re­gret the path he has cho­sen.</p>
    <p>What mo­ti­vates me is I am the boss... I can man­age my time and, most im­por­tantly, no one scolds me,” he laughed.</p>
