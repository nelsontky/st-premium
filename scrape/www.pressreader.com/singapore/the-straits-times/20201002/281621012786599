    <p>Amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, jobs and the cost of liv­ing weighed heav­ily on Sin­ga­pore­ans’ minds as they headed to the polls in July, ac­cord­ing to a post-elec­tion sur­vey.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal di­ver­sity, too, was a key con­sid­er­a­tion among the coun­try’s younger and bet­ter-ed­u­cated vot­ers.</p>
    <p>And across all age groups, there was a slide in the pro­por­tion of peo­ple who thought the rul­ing Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) was cred­i­ble, while the op­po­site was true for the op­po­si­tion Work­ers’ Party (WP).</p>
    <p>These are among the key find­ings of a post-GE2020 sur­vey con­ducted by the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies (IPS), and which were pre­sented yes­ter­day at an on­line forum it had or­gan­ised.</p>
    <p>The think-tank polled a sam­ple of 4,027 vot­ing-age Sin­ga­pore­ans by three meth­ods – ran­domly through land­lines, as well as mo­bile phones and an on­line sur­vey, which was weighted to be rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the na­tional pop­u­la­tion in terms of age, gen­der and race.</p>
    <p>It had done the same af­ter the gen­eral elec­tions in 2006, 2011 and 2015.</p>
    <p>In GE2020, the PAP’s vote share shrank by al­most nine per­cent­age points from the pre­vi­ous elec­tion in 2015, to 61.24 per cent.</p>
    <p>The July 10 elec­tion also saw the WP make another break­through by wrest­ing the Sengkang Group Rep­re­sen­ta­tion Con­stituency (GRC) – its sec­ond – from the PAP.</p>
    <p>As with pre­vi­ous sur­veys, vot­ers cited the “need for good and ef­fi­cient govern­ment” as the top pri­or­ity on a list of 15 is­sues.</p>
    <p>A new item on this year’s list that was among the top is­sues was the Govern­ment’s han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic. Al­most nine out of 10 vot­ers sur­veyed said it was “im­por­tant” or “very im­por­tant”.</p>
    <p>But three ma­jor is­sues that saw the sharpest spike in be­ing “very im­por­tant” to vot­ers, com­pared with 2015, were the jobs sit­u­a­tion, cost of liv­ing and the need for dif­fer­ent views in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Jobs and cost of liv­ing were a fo­cus of those aged 30 to 54 in low- to mid­dle-in­come house­holds, while hav­ing greater po­lit­i­cal di­ver­sity ap­pealed more to younger vot­ers aged 21 to 29 hold­ing pro­fes­sional, man­age­rial, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) jobs.</p>
    <p>“Both sets of con­sid­er­a­tions played out in GE2020 but among dif­fer­ent groups of vot­ers,” said the IPS re­search team.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with 2015, plu­ral­ists, or those who de­sire more po­lit­i­cal di­ver­sity, rose slightly by around 4 per­cent­age points to 22.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>While they are typ­i­cally younger and more well-off, what stood out this year was the in­creased pro­por­tion among the low­est-in­come house­holds earn­ing less than $2,000 a month, and those with non-ter­tiary post-sec­ondary qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser, a mem­ber of the sur­vey team, said the find­ings in­di­cate that so­cio-eco­nomic class and age are im­por­tant in de­ter­min­ing vot­ers’ per­cep­tions and concerns.</p>
    <p>“Those in their 40s are the sand­wiched gen­er­a­tion who have to look af­ter both the young and el­derly. Dur­ing Covid-19, they are the ones in dan­ger of los­ing their jobs.</p>
    <p>“Their sense of in­come and job in­se­cu­rity may have in­flu­enced the way they voted in this elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>The emer­gence of cred­i­ble op­po­si­tion par­ties over time could also im­pact the way peo­ple vote, he added.</p>
    <p>“All things be­ing equal, if we see one or more of these par­ties gain­ing in cred­i­bil­ity, it will eat into the vote share of the PAP.”</p>
