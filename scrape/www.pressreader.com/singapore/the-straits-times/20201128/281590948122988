    <p>HDT Sin­ga­pore Taxi has be­come the first taxi business to fold un­der the eco­nomic fall­out of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with the Land Trans­port Author­ity this week ac­cept­ing its ap­pli­ca­tion to close. About 90 taxi driv­ers and four back-end staff were let go, a spokesman for the elec­tric taxi op­er­a­tor said.</p>
    <p>HDT Sin­ga­pore Taxi has be­come the first taxi business to fold amid the eco­nomic fall­out from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with the Land Trans­port Author­ity this week ac­cept­ing its ap­pli­ca­tion to close.</p>
    <p>The elec­tric taxi op­er­a­tor said it had been “wrestling with the slow­ing growth” of the business since the start of the year.</p>
    <p>About 90 taxi driv­ers and four back-end staff were let go, an HDT spokesman said, at­tribut­ing the de­ci­sion to the “pro­longed, de­bil­i­tat­ing im­pact” of the coro­n­avirus on the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>It said it is restruc­tur­ing to fo­cus on other green trans­port so­lu­tions, like elec­tric buses and trucks, as well as the leas­ing of elec­tric ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which was granted a full taxi ser­vice op­er­a­tor li­cence in 2018, is the small­est taxi com­pany in Sin­ga­pore. It op­er­ated about 100 elec­tric taxis, and had said it wanted to ex­pand its fleet to 800 by 2022.</p>
    <p>Un­like the more flex­i­ble mod­els of other taxi and pri­vate-hire com­pa­nies, which treat driv­ers as self­em­ployed, HDT em­ployed its cab­bies and paid them salaries, with perks such as an­nual leave and con­tri­bu­tions to the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF).</p>
    <p>Those re­trenched will be paid a month of salary for each year of ser­vice, on a pro-rata ba­sis. Driv­ers will be given their an­nual wage sup­ple­ment, have their Medis­ave ac­counts topped up till the end of the year, and be given a one-off re­trench­ment ben­e­fit “as a ges­ture of grat­i­tude”, the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang Hin Kee, ex­ec­u­tive ad­viser to the Na­tional Taxi As­so­ci­a­tion and the Na­tional Pri­vate Hire Ve­hi­cles As­so­ci­a­tion, said HDT’s em­ploy­ment model meant it has had to bear a big­ger bur­den of the crash in the taxi mar­ket this year.</p>
    <p>He said that, ul­ti­mately, driv­ers could not “de­liver the tar­gets” to match the salary paid by HDT.</p>
    <p>There has also not been much of a clam­our among cab­bies for HDT’s em­ploy­ment model, with many pre­fer­ring to be self-em­ployed and have more flex­i­ble rental.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, it’s about the mar­ket los­ing 40 per cent of rid­er­ship de­mand. There are no tourists and no nightlife and very few en­ter­tain­ment venues,” he said.</p>
    <p>De­mand for taxis and pri­vate­hire cars dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker in April and May was al­most non-ex­is­tent. Even now, with the econ­omy slowly re­open­ing, rid­er­ship con­tin­ues to hover around 60 per cent to 70 per cent of pre-Covid-19 lev­els, severely im­pact­ing driv­ers’ – and taxi com­pa­nies’ – rev­enue streams.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Amy Khor said the news was “un­for­tu­nate” and that taxi driv­ers and staff will re­ceive fair treat­ment such as re­trench­ment ben­e­fits and the nec­es­sary job sup­port from rel­e­vant agen­cies.</p>
    <p>“Driv­ers who wish to con­tinue driv­ing can con­sider join­ing HDT Sin­ga­pore Taxi’s pri­vate hire car and pri­vate bus arms, or other taxi op­er­a­tors or trans­port com­pa­nies,” she said.</p>
    <p>“The Na­tional Taxi As­so­ci­a­tion will also help those who wish to con­sider tran­sit­ing to other ca­reer options out­side of trans­port.”</p>
