    <p>De­spite the eco­nomic un­cer­tain­ties this year due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, more em­ploy­ers have been tap­ping pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes to reskill mid-ca­reer new hires or pre­pare cur­rent em­ploy­ees for new roles, said Work­force Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>De­spite the eco­nomic un­cer­tain­ties this year due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, more em­ploy­ers have been tap­ping pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes (PCPs) to reskill mid-ca­reer new hires or pre­pare cur­rent em­ploy­ees for new roles.</p>
    <p>More than 900 com­pa­nies took part in PCPs in the first half of this year, up about 13 per cent from the same pe­riod last year, said Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG), the statu­tory board which de­vel­ops and runs PCPs.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, more than 2,600 mid­ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als ben­e­fited in the first half of this year, about 20 per cent more than the num­ber who did so in the first half of last year.</p>
    <p>The in­crease was due mainly to more peo­ple tak­ing up re­de­ploy­ment PCPs, which pre­pare them for new or en­hanced roles in their ex­ist­ing or­gan­i­sa­tion, said WSG.</p>
    <p>Other types of PCPs pro­vide train­ing and job place­ments or work at­tach­ments in growth sec­tors.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity Academy part­ners Straits In­ter­ac­tive, a data pro­tec­tion and pri­vacy spe­cial­ist, to jointly de­liver the PCP for Data Pro­tec­tion Of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>The place-and-train pro­gramme has, in the last three months, en­rolled an av­er­age of three par­tic­i­pants a month. Pre­vi­ously, its av­er­age monthly par­tic­i­pa­tion rate was one.</p>
    <p>“The PCPs are par­tic­u­larly rel­e­vant dur­ing th­ese chal­leng­ing times when busi­nesses need new skills as they repivot, and when our work­ing pro­fes­sion­als need reskilling to land new jobs that are par­tic­u­larly rel­e­vant for in­dus­try,” said Dr Lim Lai Cheng, the academy’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>There are now about 100 PCPs across more than 30 sec­tors, and the Gov­ern­ment said in May that it will ramp up PCPs for mid-ca­reerists as part of the 100,000 op­por­tu­ni­ties un­der the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age over the next 12 months.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants’ course fees and salaries or train­ing allowances are sub­sidised by the Gov­ern­ment to help them move into jobs or sec­tors with good ca­reer prospects.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts and past PCP par­tic­i­pants said the right mind­set and ex­pec­ta­tions are key to suc­cess­ful tran­si­tions with th­ese pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Mr Chris Spen­dle, Asean HR leader at hu­man re­source con­sul­tancy Mercer, said one chal­lenge in match­ing the de­mands of em­ploy­ers and work­ers is in pay ex­pec­ta­tions for sub­ject-mat­ter ex­perts or middle man­agers in spe­cialised roles.</p>
    <p>“Work­ers may need to adopt a longer-term earn­ing out­look and recog­nise that some­times a short­term de­crease in com­pen­sa­tion to move into a new job is an in­vest­ment in a new ca­reer path that will al­low for greater earn­ings in the long run, as their cur­rent role’s pay lev­els may stag­nate,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This is es­pe­cially the case in newly cre­ated fields, roles and skill sets where the ben­e­fits of be­ing a first mover, and gain­ing the new skills ahead of one’s peers, can re­ally pay off in the long run.”</p>
    <p>He added that em­ploy­ers can use skills mapping and re­design se­lec­tion pro­cesses, to en­sure they do not overem­pha­sise tech­ni­cal skills and over­look work­ers with the soft skills and per­son­al­ity traits to thrive in an in­creas­ingly un­cer­tain world.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) said in­di­vid­u­als keen on PCPs need to un­der­stand the in­dus­try, em­ploy­ers and jobs that they might be placed in af­ter com­plet­ing train­ing.</p>
    <p>“They will be ‘con­vert­ing’ to new job roles which may have po­ten­tial chal­lenges in train­ing and de­ploy­ment, and thus, they need to adapt well and be re­silient,” she said.</p>
    <p>NUS is a pro­gramme man­ager of two PCPs and train­ing part­ner for an­other two.</p>
    <p>Aux­il­iary po­lice of­fi­cer Hoo Ban Aik, 49, is one who made a big switch when he started work this year on the se­cu­rity team at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health.</p>
    <p>He was re­trenched in 2015 from his en­gi­neer­ing job in the semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try as his com­pany re­struc­tured, and did free­lance de­liv­ery work for a few years. He was un­able to find a full-time job in his pre­vi­ous in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing al­ways re­spected peo­ple in uni­form, he took up the PCP for Aux­il­iary Po­lice Of­fi­cer (Armed) in Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>He at­tended a 12-week res­i­dent course which in­cluded phys­i­cal fit­ness and shoot­ing range train­ing, as well as lessons in law and recog­nis­ing ter­ror­ist threats. Sergeant Hoo said he booked out on Fri­days and booked in on Sun­days.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing twice the av­er­age age among his batch of 12 trainees, he sur­prised him­self by achiev­ing the best re­sults in the in­di­vid­ual phys­i­cal pro­fi­ciency test.</p>
    <p>“The in­struc­tors were very help­ful and con­stantly mo­ti­vated me. It’s im­por­tant to adopt the right mind­set. If you work to­wards your goal step by step, you can achieve it,” he said.</p>
