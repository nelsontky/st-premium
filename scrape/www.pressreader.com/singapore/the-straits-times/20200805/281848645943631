    <p>BEI­JING/SHANG­HAI • China vowed yes­ter­day to re­tal­i­ate if the US per­sisted with “hos­tile ac­tion” against Chi­nese jour­nal­ists who may be forced to leave the coun­try in the com­ing days if their US visas are not ex­tended.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin told re­porters at a daily brief­ing in Bei­jing that no Chi­nese jour­nal­ist in the United States had been granted a visa ex­ten­sion since Wash­ing­ton, on May 11, lim­ited their stay to 90 days, with an op­tion to ex­tend.</p>
    <p>“The US has been es­ca­lat­ing its ac­tions against Chi­nese jour­nal­ists,” Mr Wang told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“The US should im­me­di­ately cor­rect its mis­take and stop its ac­tions. If the US per­sists, China will take a nec­es­sary and le­git­i­mate re­sponse to safe­guard its rights,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang did not say how many Chi­nese jour­nal­ists were af­fected or what re­tal­i­a­tion Bei­jing might con­sider, but the ed­i­tor of China’s Global Times news­pa­per said ear­lier yes­ter­day that US jour­nal­ists based in Hong Kong would be among those tar­geted should Chi­nese jour­nal­ists be forced to leave the US.</p>
    <p>“Chi­nese side has pre­pared for the worst sce­nario that all Chi­nese jour­nal­ists have to leave,” Mr Hu Xi­jin said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“If that’s the case, Chi­nese side will re­tal­i­ate, in­clud­ing tar­get­ing</p>
    <p>US jour­nal­ists based in HK.”</p>
    <p>The Global Times is pub­lished by the Peo­ple’s Daily, the of­fi­cial news­pa­per of China’s rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries, whose re­la­tions have de­te­ri­o­rated sharply re­cently over var­i­ous is­sues in­clud­ing trade and the coro­n­avirus out­break, have ex­changed sev­eral tit­for-tat ac­tions in­volv­ing jour­nal­ists in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton in March slashed the num­ber of Chi­nese na­tion­als al­lowed to work at the US of­fices of ma­jor Chi­nese state-owned me­dia from 160 to 100.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing in turn had ex­pelled US jour­nal­ists work­ing for three Amer­i­can news­pa­pers – The New York Times, The Wall Street Jour­nal and The Wash­ing­ton Post.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has also threat­ened to match any more ac­tion taken by Wash­ing­ton against Chi­nese jour­nal­ists.</p>
