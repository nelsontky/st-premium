    <p>Sin­ga­pore has not made any big changes in its medium- to longterm tourism in­vest­ment plans as a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Projects like the re­de­vel­op­ment of Sen­tosa and Pu­lau Brani, as well as the up­com­ing Jurong Lake Dis­trict tourism hub, will be­gin to take shape by the mid-2020s – when the tourism in­dus­try should see a re­cov­ery, said Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan yesterday.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­vest­ments are nec­es­sary to re­main com­pet­i­tive, he stressed, adding that STB will ramp up mar­ket­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in se­lect over­seas mar­kets so th­ese can be re­vived quickly when travel re­stric­tions are lifted.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said Sin­ga­pore re­mains com­mit­ted to its long-term plans for the tourism sec­tor, as it be­lieves global tourism will pro­gres­sively re­cover.</p>
    <p>The as­sur­ances come amid ques­tions about the fate of the $9 bil­lion ex­pan­sion plans by Sin­ga­pore’s two in­te­grated re­sorts after Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) re­trenched its staff last week. Both RWS and Ma­rina Bay Sands have said they will be con­tin­u­ing with their plans, which are ex­pected to be com­pleted by 2025.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said STB has not been in­formed of any other re­trench­ments, but cau­tioned that more are to be ex­pected. He added that STB is work­ing with the Man­power Min­istry and unions to en­sure sup­port is quickly pro­vided to work­ers when­ever a tourism busi­ness sig­nals it is con­sid­er­ing re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>Last year, Sin­ga­pore’s tourism in­dus­try em­ployed about 65,000 work­ers across ar­eas such as ho­tels and at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>While STB had ear­lier pro­jected tourist ar­rivals to fall by up to 30 per cent this year, Mr Tan said it would be im­pos­si­ble to tell what the true im­pact of the coro­n­avirus out­break would be.</p>
    <p>“We have al­ready seen num­bers for April and May at a 99.9 per cent drop, so that’s the way that we’re look­ing at it for the rest of the year,” he said.</p>
    <p>Projects like the re­de­vel­op­ment of Sen­tosa and Pu­lau Brani, as well as the up­com­ing Jurong Lake Dis­trict tourism hub, will be­gin to take shape by the mid-2020s – when the tourism in­dus­try should see a re­cov­ery, said Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan yesterday.</p>
