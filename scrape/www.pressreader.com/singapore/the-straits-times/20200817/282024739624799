    <p>As­ses­sors ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Law seek to make de­ter­mi­na­tions that en­sure a fair and eq­ui­table out­come for all par­ties in a con­tract dis­pute.</p>
    <p>But this is no easy task.</p>
    <p>Three pro­fes­sion­als with le­gal and au­dit­ing back­grounds, who vol­un­teered to be as­ses­sors to help re­solve dis­putes, high­lighted the chal­lenges they faced in e-mail in­ter­views with The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>They are among more than 200 as­ses­sors from the le­gal, ac­coun­tancy, fi­nan­cial and other in­dus­try sec­tors that have been ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Law to set­tle dis­putes aris­ing from the ap­pli­ca­tion of the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, in the case of a pri­vate-hire driver who was un­able to make his monthly car in­stal­ments to the hire-pur­chase com­pany after the out­break started, au­di­tor Chong Yit Jen had to as­cer­tain whether the driver’s in­abil­ity to pay was due to Covid-19 and not due to his own per­sonal fi­nan­cial is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ms Chong, a se­nior man­ager of as­sur­ance at Ernst & Young, said she looked at the driver’s in­stal­ment pay­ment his­tory and his earn­ings as a pri­vate-hire driver be­fore and after Covid-19 broke out.</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenge is to find a right bal­ance and a mid­dle point for both par­ties; the de­ci­sion should not af­fect ei­ther party ad­versely,” she said.</p>
    <p>In an­other case in­volv­ing a de­posit for a tour that was can­celled, dis­putes lawyer Michelle Lee from Den­tons Rodyk & David­son said both par­ties had dif­fer­ing ideas.</p>
    <p>“While the travel agency of­fered to con­vert the de­posit to travel cred­its for fu­ture book­ings, the cus­tomer re­quested a full re­fund, cit­ing con­cerns such as pos­si­ble insolvency of the travel agency in the near fu­ture,” said Ms Lee.</p>
    <p>“We ex­plored al­ter­na­tive so­lu­tions such as re­fund­ing a por­tion of the de­posit... We also im­posed con­di­tions to make it eas­ier for the con­sumer to utilise the travel cred­its (for ex­am­ple, a longer pe­riod for re­demp­tion and for changes to des­ti­na­tion or pas­sen­gers to be at no ex­tra cost).”</p>
    <p>But par­ties may not al­ways be pleased with the out­come of the as­ses­sor’s de­ter­mi­na­tion in these dis­putes.</p>
    <p>Ms Nur Rauda Mo­hamed Said, who is now a trans­ac­tion coun­sel at Per­pet­ual (Asia) but was a cor­po­rate lawyer when she vol­un­teered to be an as­ses­sor, han­dled dis­putes in­volv­ing event-re­lated con­tracts in­clud­ing wed­ding ban­quet de­posits where venue providers were not will­ing to re­fund any of the de­posit or were will­ing to re­fund only a small amount.</p>
    <p>She noted that some com­mon chal­lenges faced by in­di­vid­u­als in these cases in­clude aus­pi­cious dates which they may not be able to se­cure after Covid-19 re­stric­tions are lifted, while busi­nesses, which are suf­fer­ing from a drop in rev­enue, may strug­gle to make cash re­funds.</p>
    <p>“We try to con­sider both sides of the story, but it is im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore­ans to em­pathise also. Covid-19 has hit ev­ery­body hard,” she added.</p>
