    <p>In a span of five months, Luo Tianze lost both his par­ents to can­cer. Their deaths, in the midst of the Covid-19 pan­demic, came at the end of a seven-year or­deal for the 31-year-old and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>His par­ents will not be there to wit­ness his grad­u­a­tion from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa) and ful­fil his long-stand­ing dream of be­com­ing a pro­fes­sional mu­si­cian.</p>
    <p>“The grief that comes from a loss like this is hard to de­scribe. My par­ents were al­ways around to greet me when I re­turned home af­ter a long day of classes or a per­for­mance. They started this jour­ney with me but I am fin­ish­ing it on my own,” said Mr Luo.</p>
    <p>In 2013, his mother, Madam Chia Kui Lian, a for­mer sales pro­moter, was di­ag­nosed with a rare con­di­tion called Neu­romyeli­tis Op­tica (NMO), a cen­tral ner­vous sys­tem dis­or­der that pri­mar­ily af­fects the eye nerves and spinal cord.</p>
    <p>What be­gan as numb­ness in her limbs de­te­ri­o­rated to ir­re­versible nerve dam­age that ren­dered her wheel­chair-bound in later years.</p>
    <p>In 2016, she was di­ag­nosed with sec­ond-stage lym­phoma, a can­cer that at­tacks in­fec­tion-fight­ing white blood cells.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily suf­fered an­other blow when Mr Luo’s fa­ther, Mr Low Boo Kwan, a re­tired lab of­fi­cer, found out he had fourth-stage pan­cre­atic can­cer in Jan­uary this year.</p>
    <p>As hos­pi­tal vis­its be­came more fre­quent and the house­hold faced fi­nan­cial strain over the years, it was Mr Luo’s pas­sion for mu­sic that gave him the strength to cope and the pur­pose to push ahead.</p>
    <p>Mu­sic has been an in­te­gral part of Mr Luo’s life since he joined the con­cert band at River­side Sec­ondary School and be­gan play­ing the sax­o­phone. But the same pas­sion did not ex­tend to his aca­demic sub­jects.</p>
    <p>“Of the three chil­dren, I was the one who was play­ful and did not pay at­ten­tion to my grades. Like in any tra­di­tional Asian fam­ily, my par­ents wanted to see me suc­ceed,” he said.</p>
    <p>His younger sis­ter, aged 30, is a civil ser­vant while his el­der brother, 34, is a com­puter pro­gram­mer.</p>
    <p>While help­ing a friend coach stu­dents for the Sin­ga­pore Youth Fes­ti­val in 2012, Mr Luo dis­cov­ered he liked teach­ing mu­sic and per­form­ing. In 2016, fol­low­ing national ser­vice and a work stint, he en­rolled in Nafa for a diploma in mu­sic.</p>
    <p>But he soon found him­self skip­ping classes to care for his mum as she got sicker, and then go­ing to school at night to prac­tise.</p>
    <p>“I would stay with her till about 9pm and then go back to school to re­hearse alone. My mu­sic healed me and kept me dis­tracted from pon­der­ing about the next day. It was cathar­tic,” he said.</p>
    <p>When the guilt of be­ing tru­ant got to him, he opened up to some lec­tur­ers and was “sur­prised and hum­bled” by how un­der­stand­ing and help­ful they were.</p>
    <p>“Nafa has been my safe space. When I prac­tise and I teach, I feel happy be­cause th­ese are the things that I love. I am not an ex­pres­sive per­son by na­ture, so mu­sic helped me to find clo­sure with the cir­cum­stances at home, bal­ance my emo­tions and find peace,” he said.</p>
    <p>Go­ing into the last year of his diploma course, Mr Luo found him­self at a cross­roads, torn be­tween con­tin­u­ing on to do a de­gree and go­ing back to work to ease the fam­ily’s fi­nan­cial bur­den. By that time, his fa­ther had suf­fered a stroke.</p>
    <p>“I felt self­ish for want­ing to join the de­gree pro­gramme,” he said.</p>
    <p>His sib­lings, how­ever, were sup­port­ive.</p>
    <p>“While we had fi­nan­cial strug­gles, we re­alised the ul­ti­mate goal was for him to have a de­gree which would serve him well in the long run,” said his brother, Dezhang. “While I was ini­tially scep­ti­cal about his op­por­tu­ni­ties as an artist in Sin­ga­pore, it is com­fort­ing to see his ca­reer path is pro­gress­ing. Where he could not con­trib­ute fi­nan­cially, he tried to give his time and care to our par­ents.”</p>
    <p>Mr Luo’s hard work paid off, win­ning him ad­mis­sion into the Royal Col­lege of Mu­sic (RCM)-Nafa de­gree pro­gramme as well as the San San Mu­sic Merit Award and Higher Ed­u­ca­tion Bur­sary, which he said cov­ered half of the year’s tu­ition fees.</p>
    <p>But his joy was cut short by his fa­ther’s sud­den can­cer di­ag­no­sis in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber watch­ing him sit­ting in his hos­pi­tal bed dur­ing Chi­nese New Year and I knew he was scared; he was ter­ri­fied about the fu­ture. I knew I had to stay ma­ture, and keep push­ing be­cause be­com­ing overly emo­tional was not go­ing to solve any­thing,” said Mr Luo.</p>
    <p>With both his sib­lings work­ing full time, much of the care­giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties fell on him.</p>
    <p>He can­celled his teach­ing ses­sions and re­stricted him­self from leav­ing home as much as pos­si­ble to re­duce the risk of Covid-19 in­fec­tion to his par­ents. He went out only for gro­ceries or medicine.</p>
    <p>Madam Chia’s con­di­tion took a turn for the worse and she fell into a coma. As this was dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, fam­ily mem­bers were able to visit her only two at a time and say their fi­nal good­byes on May 11. She was 64.</p>
    <p>Barely a month af­ter her death, Mr Luo clinched the RCM Mu­si­cal Ex­cel­lence Award, given an­nu­ally to an ex­cep­tional stu­dent in the pro­gramme based on aca­demic per­for­mance and fi­nan­cial needs.</p>
    <p>“I was numb. I re­mem­ber feel­ing sur­prised that I had re­ceived the award, and shar­ing the news with my sib­lings. But when I saw my mother’s empty bed ev­ery morn­ing, I knew that the award did not make up for her ab­sence,” he said.</p>
    <p>The sib­lings’ fa­ther, who was 68, died a few months later on Sept 3, with the three by his bed­side.</p>
    <p>De­spite Mr Luo’s grief, there was re­lief that his par­ents no longer had to suf­fer. To hon­our their last wishes, the sib­lings cre­mated their par­ents and spread their ashes in the sea.</p>
    <p>Mr Luo said he misses his par­ents’ con­stant pres­ence, but is hold­ing fast to his dream of teach­ing and help­ing oth­ers dis­cover muhttps://str.sg/grit04 sic as he did in school. “I learnt com­pas­sion and above all pa­tience dur­ing this pe­riod. I know I will be able to ap­ply this as an in­struc­tor in a class­room,” he said.</p>
    <p>“In the past, when I played mu­sic, a sad song was sim­ply sad and a happy song was just happy. But now I un­der­stand the nu­ances.</p>
    <p>“I can re­late to the com­poser’s melodies or the change in notes. The loss of a loved one helps me re­late to the songs be­yond a generic neg­a­tive or pos­i­tive feel­ing, and it brought ma­tu­rity to my mu­sic.”</p>
