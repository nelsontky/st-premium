    <p>Tuition teacher Sai­ful Rizal Az­man, 32, has ex­pe­ri­enced what it could be like to be fa­mous.</p>
    <p>A group of kids clus­tered around him af­ter ask­ing their friends: “Is that the guy from TikTok?”</p>
    <p>“I was shocked,” said Mr Sai­ful, who posts videos teach­ing math­e­mat­ics (@coach.sai­ful) and has more than 48,000 fol­low­ers on the plat­form.</p>
    <p>The founder of Math Prodi­gies Learn­ing Cen­tre of­ten posts min­i­math­e­mat­ics tu­to­ri­als on TikTok, in­clud­ing those on solv­ing PSLE (Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion) prob­lems.</p>
    <p>One of his posts on the short­form video plat­form, which fea­tures a “speed maths trick” to find what is 25 squared, was viewed about 3.2 mil­lion times.</p>
    <p>Mr Sai­ful, who started us­ing TikTok in Septem­ber last year, said: “The goal is to make kids fall in love with maths and not to fear it, which is usu­ally the main stum­bling block for them.”</p>
    <p>He used to hate the sub­ject him­self. He failed it “many times” and got an F six months be­fore his Olevel ex­ams. He worked on the math­e­mat­ics 10-year series “three times over” to even­tu­ally score an A, he said.</p>
    <p>Amid a spike in TikTok videos with ed­u­ca­tional con­tent cre­ated in Sin­ga­pore, tu­tors and teach­ers are us­ing the plat­form, once the pre­serve of danc­ing videos, to reach a wider au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>TikTok’s user and con­tent op­er­a­tions man­ager, Sin­ga­pore, Ms Doreen Tan, said there has been “an uptick” in videos with teach­ing and learn­ing con­tent on the plat­form in Sin­ga­pore un­der #learning­is­fun.</p>
    <p>Videos with this hash­tag have gained more than 208 mil­lion views on TikTok. The videos cover top­ics from re­vi­sion tips and in­vest­ment hacks to health ad­vice.</p>
    <p>TikTok has launched the hash­tag #studytips, whose videos have about 290 mil­lion views, as part of a series of chal­lenges with ed­u­ca­tional hash­tags that have gar­nered “sig­nif­i­cant lo­cal trac­tion on the plat­form”, Ms Tan said.</p>
    <p>Ms Ber­nice Loon, a ge­og­ra­phy teacher at CHIJ Sec­ondary (Toa Payoh), said ed­u­ca­tional videos gain trac­tion from TikTok’s pop­u­lar­ity among chil­dren and youth.</p>
    <p>Ms Loon, 29, who also posts ed­u­ca­tional con­tent on YouTube and In­sta­gram, is known as That Ge­og­ra­phy Teacher on her epony­mous web­site. She started mak­ing light­hearted TikTok (@ber­nice_loon) videos dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker this year, but switched to post­ing study tips when some­one asked for them.</p>
    <p>She un­packs ge­o­graph­i­cal terms and out­lines tech­niques to nail ex­am­i­na­tion ques­tions for her more than 6,400 fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>“Stu­dents who ben­e­fit the most are those who are not able to keep up in class. I no­tice they will screenshot the TikToks and write it down like their notes,” she said.</p>
    <p>There are pros and cons to us­ing TikTok for teach­ing, says Dr An­drew Yee, a fac­ulty fel­low at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign (SUTD).</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, not all con­tent is suited to be ex­plained through videos that are shorter than a minute, so one of the chal­lenges for ed­u­ca­tors is to iden­tify what kind of con­tent is best con­veyed through TikTok,” he said.</p>
    <p>Still, he added, short-form videos can be “a use­ful tool for mi­cro-learn­ing, where new learn­ing ma­te­rial is pro­vided in a bite-sized pack­age so learn­ers can pick up new knowl­edge in a way that is en­gag­ing and less cog­ni­tively tax­ing”.</p>
    <p>But one con­tro­ver­sial as­pect of so­cial me­dia, he said, is the use of “rec­om­mender al­go­rithms”.</p>
    <p>Dr Yee cau­tioned: “While th­ese al­go­rithms are meant to cu­rate con­tent that is of in­ter­est to the user, they may not nec­es­sar­ily be ori­ented to­wards pro­vid­ing what is most ben­e­fi­cial to the user.</p>
    <p>“Hence, it may be nec­es­sary for teach­ers or par­ents to ac­tively guide kids’ use of TikTok even if they are us­ing it for ed­u­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>Pri­vate tu­tor Dy­lan Lim, 24, does not only use TikTok for teach­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, who gives maths tuition to sec­ondary school stu­dents, also gives ad­vice to teens.</p>
    <p>His ac­count (@dy­lan­limfj), which has about 2,400 fol­low­ers, has posts with ti­tles like Pas­sion Vs Pay­check and Say Good­bye To Care­less Mis­takes.</p>
    <p>He has met stu­dents who are de­cid­ing whether to go to a polytech­nic or ju­nior col­lege. He said: “Many fear that if they pur­sue what they love, their ca­reer prospects would not be good.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said a stu­dent should first find out what he is cu­ri­ous about. He can start by read­ing about a sub­ject he is in­ter­ested in, and then tak­ing up a re­lated course or a pas­sion project. This would give him the con­fi­dence to make a more in­formed de­ci­sion on his aca­demic and ca­reer choices later.</p>
    <p>He said: “My in­ten­tion is to en­gage stu­dents and I see TikTok as a way to hone their in­ter­ests.”</p>
