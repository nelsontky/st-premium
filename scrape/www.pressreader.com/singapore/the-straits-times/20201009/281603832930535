    <p>A new pro­gramme has been launched to sup­port about 20,000 re­tail­ers and food and bev­er­age (F&B) en­ter­prises in the heart­land to keep pace with dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and adopt e-pay­ments as well as other dig­i­tal com­merce so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>The Heart­lands Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme, which was an­nounced yes­ter­day, is part of the Gov­ern­ment’s broader re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts in the heart­land.</p>
    <p>It will of­fer dis­counted so­lu­tions from five dig­i­tal so­lu­tion providers – Carousell, Fave, Grab, Nets and Shopee. Busi­nesses can tap pref­er­en­tial dis­counted rates for e-pay­ments us­ing Fave, Grab and Nets, and gain on­line vis­i­bil­ity through pro­mo­tions and ad­ver­tis­ing on ecom­merce plat­forms Carousell, Fave and Shopee.</p>
    <p>Each en­ter­prise can ap­ply for a dig­i­tal com­merce so­lu­tion with only one ven­dor, and el­i­gi­ble firms need pay only 10 per cent of the qual­i­fy­ing costs.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme is led by the Heart­land Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and Re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion Com­mit­tee and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG), and key part­ners in­clude the com­mu­nity de­vel­op­ment coun­cils; the Fed­er­a­tion of Mer­chants’ As­so­ci­a­tions, Sin­ga­pore (FMAS); Heart­land En­ter­prise Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore (HECS); mer­chants as­so­ci­a­tions and SME cen­tres.</p>
    <p>The Heart­land Dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and Re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion Com­mit­tee is cochaired by Senior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion as well as Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Sim Ann, and Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try as well as Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Low Yen Ling.</p>
    <p>It in­cludes rep­re­sen­ta­tives from ESG, FMAS, Gov Tech, the Hous­ing Board, In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity and the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat told Par­lia­ment on Mon­day that Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and trans­for­ma­tion of firms big and small, and a key pri­or­ity is to build on this mo­men­tum and bring dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion to the heart­land.</p>
    <p>Close to 200 am­bas­sadors from HECS, the SG Dig­i­tal Of­fice and SME cen­tres have started ground outreach ef­forts in neigh­bour­hoods across Sin­ga­pore to quicken the pace of dig­i­tal adop­tion, shar­ing the ben­e­fits of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and pro­vid­ing step-by-step guid­ance to busi­nesses. This in­cludes in­tro­duc­ing avail­able e-pay­ment and dig­i­tal com­merce tools, and ad­vis­ing busi­nesses on which tools are most suit­able for their needs.</p>
    <p>So­lu­tion providers will also or­gan­ise train­ing cour­ses to help en­ter­prises bet­ter un­der­stand these dig­i­tal so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>FMAS pres­i­dent Yeo Hiang Meng noted that chal­lenges in get­ting heart­land en­ter­prises to dig­i­talise in­clude the lack of dig­i­tal knowl­edge as well as mer­chants’ con­cerns over costs of in­vest­ment and trans­ac­tion fees.</p>
    <p>“Though they un­der­stand the ben­e­fits the new tech­nolo­gies can bring them, they are still hes­i­tant as they lack man­power to han­dle the new sys­tems,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Through the Heart­lands Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme, en­ter­prises can save a lot of time and en­ergy in man­ual pro­cesses and in­stead fo­cus on im­prov­ing and ex­pand­ing their business. This will serve as a step­ping stone for en­ter­prises to slowly evolve into a fully dig­i­tal business model,” Mr Yeo said.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim said that while heart­land busi­nesses had al­ready been gear­ing up for trans­for­ma­tion, the Covid-19 pan­demic em­pha­sised the need for dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and in­no­va­tion to even more cus­tomers and business own­ers.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee seeks to help these busi­nesses achieve real change, she said. “This means seek­ing out op­por­tu­ni­ties to in­te­grate hard­ware up­grades with business process ad­just­ments, along­side mo­bil­is­ing of stake­hold­ers like mer­chant as­so­ci­a­tions,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Low echoed that view, ac­knowl­edg­ing that many heart­land en­ter­prises recog­nise the need to trans­form and move be­yond the bricks-and-mor­tar model.</p>
    <p>She said: “We are ral­ly­ing along­side them to up­lift and fu­ture­proof their busi­nesses by ac­cel­er­at­ing their adop­tion of e-pay­ment and dig­i­tal com­merce.”</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing a strong dig­i­tal foun­da­tion will spur these en­ter­prises to look at new and dif­fer­ent ways to im­prove their oper­a­tions and business mod­els so that they can emerge even stronger from the pan­demic,” she added.</p>
