    <p>The Straits Times Vir­tual Run’s 175km race is a sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenge for many run­ners, even ex­pe­ri­enced ones.</p>
    <p>While some might have raced in marathons, it takes plan­ning to cover that dis­tance on your own in a vir­tual event.</p>
    <p>Here are some things to con­sider when plan­ning your runs:</p>
    <p>SET A CLEAR OB­JEC­TIVE</p>
    <p>Re­mem­ber not to be too am­bi­tious and aim to plan runs pro­gres­sively.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, run­ners may aim to: • Com­plete a 6km run</p>
    <p>• Com­plete a 6km run un­der 36</p>
    <p>min­utes</p>
    <p>• In­crease their weekly mileage by</p>
    <p>10 per cent each time</p>
    <p>• Com­plete a 20-minute run</p>
    <p>with­out walk­ing; or</p>
    <p>• Com­plete a 10km run with</p>
    <p>easy-mod­er­ate ef­fort.</p>
    <p>PLAN YOUR ROUTE WELL</p>
    <p>Select an area that you are in­ter­ested in ex­plor­ing or are fa­mil­iar with to help ease the wor­ries you may have.</p>
    <p>Run­ners may also get cre­ative and take dif­fer­ent routes to meet their ob­jec­tives; such as run­ning laps in the park or park con­nec­tor or even run­ning a cer­tain speed for a cer­tain dis­tance be­fore U-turn­ing.</p>
    <p>When plan­ning a route, try to choose one with fewer traf­fic lights. This will help to smoothen your run as much as pos­si­ble as there is less chance of los­ing your pace.</p>
    <p>There will be a more de­tailed guide on se­lect­ing your routes next week.</p>
    <p>TOI­LET BREAKS</p>
    <p>Be­fore start­ing your run, it is al­ways good to take note or find out if there are toi­lets along the route (ev­ery 2-3km would be ideal), such as in com­mu­nity cen­tres, parks, shop­ping malls and cof­fee shops.</p>
    <p>Re­mem­ber to bring a mask in case there is a need to stop for a toi­let or hy­dra­tion break dur­ing your run.</p>
    <p>You are also ex­pected to mask up be­fore and af­ter you run.</p>
    <p>WA­TER RE­FILL</p>
    <p>Due to Covid-19 mea­sures, drink­ing di­rectly from the wa­ter cool­ers at pub­lic hy­dra­tion points are not al­lowed although the re­fill­ing of wa­ter bot­tles is still al­lowed.</p>
    <p>An al­ter­na­tive to bring­ing your own wa­ter bot­tle would be util­is­ing vend­ing ma­chines which are read­ily avail­able in many lo­ca­tions and most of them ac­cept cash­less pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Do bring some notes/coins in case the ma­chine does not ac­cept epay­ment.</p>
    <p>IN­TER­NET CON­NEC­TIV­ITY</p>
    <p>Run­ners may ex­pe­ri­ence many GPS dead spots due to the block­age of sig­nals in ar­eas such as the Down­town/CBD area where there are many tall build­ings, or parks and reser­voirs where there is ex­ten­sive fo­liage (for ex­am­ple MacRitchie).</p>
    <p>My ad­vice would be to start your run in ar­eas which are more open and away from of­fice build­ings (eg Fuller­ton or the Shoppes at Ma­rina Bay Sands) or to run along the board­walk (in MacRitchie) where you will have a bet­ter GPS sig­nal.</p>
    <p>While run­ning at such places with many GPS dead spots, I sug­gest you pay less at­ten­tion to your pace on your smart de­vice as the data may be in­ac­cu­rate.</p>
    <p>Choose a route with a known dis­tance so that you will not have to rely on your smart de­vice for this data, which may not be ac­cu­rate due to the GPS dead spots.</p>
    <p>STAY RESTED AND HY­DRATED</p>
    <p>Run­ners should also try to run at times when it is cooler, such as at dawn or in the evening.</p>
    <p>This will help to re­duce the amount of wa­ter breaks re­quired and the chance of heat in­juries.</p>
    <p>FOOD TO AVOID</p>
    <p>Try to avoid hav­ing spicy food or dairy prod­ucts be­fore your runs. Avoid eat­ing heavy meals two to three hours be­fore you start.</p>
