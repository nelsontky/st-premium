    <p>Some work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries will, from later this month, be able to leave their dorms to visit cen­tres where they can buy gro­ceries and SIM cards, and re­mit money to their loved ones back home.</p>
    <p>This will be part of a trial for work­ers to en­gage in so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties while en­sur­ing they are safe from Covid-19, fol­low­ing the clear­ance of all dor­mi­to­ries on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), to­gether with in­dus­try as­so­ci­a­tions and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions, said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that smallscale tri­als for the vis­its to recre­ation cen­tres will be­gin this month for res­i­dents from se­lected cleared dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The even­tual goal is to al­low res­i­dents from cleared dorms to en­joy their rest days with­out move­ment re­stric­tions, it added.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it recog­nises that leisure and be­ing able to run er­rands are ac­tiv­i­ties that are “im­por­tant for the men­tal well­be­ing of the res­i­dents”.</p>
    <p>It added that it “ap­pre­ci­ates work­ers’ and em­ploy­ers’ co­op­er­a­tion over these last four months and un­der­stands their anx­i­eties”.</p>
    <p>Sui­cides and at­tempted sui­cides re­ported by the me­dia and doc­u­mented in videos shared on­line have re­newed con­cerns over the men­tal and emo­tional health of work­ers, many of whom spent the past few months con­fined to their liv­ing quar­ters.</p>
    <p>MOM did not re­veal how many work­ers will be par­tic­i­pat­ing, but said the tri­als will al­low it to re­fine exit pass ar­range­ments, and pro­gres­sively in­crease the num­ber of par­tic­i­pat­ing dor­mi­to­ries over the next two months.</p>
    <p>The state­ment was jointly is­sued by MOM and 14 in­dus­try as­so­ci­a­tions and NGOs.</p>
    <p>There are eight recre­ation cen­tres, in lo­ca­tions such as Kranji, Tuas, Wood­lands and Kaki Bukit. The min­istry aims to al­low all dor­mi­tory res­i­dents to ap­ply for exit passes to visit these cen­tres by Oc­to­ber, af­ter which it will re­view the rules on how long they can stay out and where they can go on their rest days.</p>
