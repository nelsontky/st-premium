    <p>The re­cent de­ci­sion by the Turk­ish gov­ern­ment to re­con­vert the ma­jes­tic Ha­gia Sophia, which was once the world’s great­est cathe­dral, from a mu­seum back to a mosque has been bad news for Chris­tians around the world. They in­clude Pope Fran­cis, who said he was “pained” by the move, and the spir­i­tual leader of East­ern Chris­tian­ity, Ec­u­meni­cal Pa­tri­arch Bartholome­w, who said he was “sad­dened and shaken”.</p>
    <p>When con­trasted with the joy of Turkey’s con­ser­va­tive Mus­lims, all this may seem like a new episode in an old story: Is­lam ver­sus Chris­tian­ity.</p>
    <p>But some Mus­lims, in­clud­ing my­self, are not fully com­fort­able with this his­toric step, and for a good rea­son: Forced con­ver­sion of shrines, which has oc­curred too many times in hu­man his­tory in all di­rec­tions, can be ques­tioned, even from a purely Is­lamic point of view.</p>
    <p>To see why, look closely into early Is­lam, which was born in 7th-cen­tury Ara­bia as a monothe­ist cam­paign against poly­the­ism.</p>
    <p>AL­LIES AND AS­SUR­ANCES</p>
    <p>Prophet Muham­mad and his small group of be­liev­ers saw the ear­lier monothe­ists – Jews and Chris­tians – as al­lies.</p>
    <p>So when those first Mus­lims were per­se­cuted in pa­gan Mecca, some found asy­lum in the Chris­tian king­dom in Ethiopia. Years later, when the Prophet ruled Me­d­ina, he wel­comed a group of Chris­tians from the city of Na­jran to wor­ship in his own mosque.</p>
    <p>He also signed a treaty with them, which read: “There shall be no in­ter­fer­ence with the prac­tice of their faith... No bishop will be re­moved from his bish­opric, no monk from his monastery, no priest from his par­ish.” This re­li­gious plu­ral­ism was also re­flected in the Qu­ran when it said God pro­tects “monas­ter­ies, churches, syn­a­gogues and mosques in which the name of God is much men­tioned”. (22:40) It is the only verse in the Qu­ran that men­tions churches – and only in a rev­er­en­tial tone.</p>
    <p>To be sure, th­ese the­o­log­i­cal affini­ties did not pre­vent po­lit­i­cal con­flicts. Nor did they pre­vent Mus­lims, right after the Prophet’s pass­ing, from con­quer­ing Chris­tian lands, from Syria to Spain.</p>
    <p>Yet still, the early Mus­lim con­querors did some­thing un­com­mon at the time: They did not touch the shrines of the sub­ju­gated peo­ples.</p>
    <p>The Prophet’s spirit was best ex­em­pli­fied by his sec­ond suc­ces­sor Umar ibn Al-Khat­tab, soon after his con­quest of Jerusalem in 637. The city, which had been ruled by Ro­man Chris­tians for cen­turies, had been taken by Mus­lims after a long and bloody siege.</p>
    <p>Chris­tians feared a mas­sacre, but in­stead found aman or safety. Caliph Umar, “the ser­vant of God” and “the com­man­der of the faith­ful”, gave them se­cu­rity “for their pos­ses­sions, their churches and crosses”. He fur­ther as­sured: “Their churches shall not be taken for res­i­dence and shall not be de­mol­ished... nor shall their crosses be re­moved.”</p>
    <p>Chris­tian his­to­rian Eu­ty­chius even tells us that when Caliph Umar en­tered the city, the pa­tri­arch of Jerusalem, Sophro­nius, in­vited him to pray at the holi­est of all Chris­tian shrines: the Church of the Holy Sepul­chre. Umar po­litely de­clined, say­ing that Mus­lims might later take this as a rea­son to con­vert the church into a mosque.</p>
    <p>He in­stead prayed at an empty area that Chris­tians ig­nored but Jews hon­oured, then as now, as their holi­est site – the Tem­ple Mount, where to­day the West­ern Wall, the last rem­nant of that an­cient Jewish tem­ple, rises to the top of the Mount, on which the Mosque of Umar and the Dome of the Rock were built.</p>
    <p>In other words, Is­lam en­tered Jerusalem without re­ally con­vert­ing it. Even “four cen­turies after the Mus­lim con­quest”, as Is­raeli his­to­rian Oded Peri ob­serves, “the ur­ban land­scape of Jerusalem was still dom­i­nated by Chris­tian pub­lic and re­li­gious build­ings”.</p>
    <p>THE LOGIC OF EM­PIRE</p>
    <p>Yet, Is­lam was be­com­ing the re­li­gion of an em­pire, which, like all em­pires, had to jus­tify its appetite for hege­mony. Soon, some ju­rists found an ex­cuse to overcome the Jerusalem model: There, Chris­tians were given full se­cu­rity be­cause they had ul­ti­mately agreed on a peace­ful sur­ren­der. The cities that re­sisted Mus­lim con­querors, how­ever, were fair game for plun­der, en­slave­ment and con­ver­sion of their churches.</p>
    <p>In the words of Turk­ish scholar Necmed­din Guney, this le­git­i­ma­ti­sa­tion of con­ver­sion of churches came from not the Qu­ran nor the Prophetic ex­am­ple, but rather, “ad­min­is­tra­tive reg­u­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>The ju­rists who made this case, he adds, “were prob­a­bly try­ing to cre­ate a so­ci­ety that makes man­i­fest the supremacy of Is­lam in an age of re­li­gion wars”.</p>
    <p>An­other scholar, Dr Fred Don­ner, an ex­pert on early Is­lam, ar­gues that this po­lit­i­cal drive even dis­torted records of the ear­lier state of af­fairs. For ex­am­ple, later ver­sions of the aman given to the Chris­tians of</p>
    <p>Da­m­as­cus al­lot­ted Mus­lims “half of their homes and churches”. In the ear­lier ver­sion of the doc­u­ment, there was no such clause.</p>
    <p>When the Ot­tomans reached the gates of Con­stantino­ple in 1453, Is­lamic at­ti­tudes had long been im­pe­ri­alised and also tough­ened in the face of end­less con­flicts with the cru­saders.</p>
    <p>Us­ing a dis­puted li­cence of the Hanafi school of ju­rispru­dence they fol­lowed, they con­verted Ha­gia Sophia and a few other ma­jor churches. But they also did other things that rep­re­sent the bet­ter val­ues of Is­lam: They gave full pro­tec­tion to not only Greek, but also Ar­me­nian Chris­tians, re­built Is­tan­bul as a cos­mopoli­tan city and soon also wel­comed the Span­ish Jews who were flee­ing the Catholic Inquisitio­n.</p>
    <p>A CHOICE OF LEGA­CIES</p>
    <p>To­day, cen­turies later, the ques­tion for Turkey is what as­pect of this com­plex Ot­toman her­itage is re­ally more valu­able.</p>
    <p>For the re­li­gious con­ser­va­tives who have ral­lied be­hind Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan in the past two decades, the main an­swer seems to be im­pe­rial glory em­bod­ied in an ab­so­lute ruler. For other Turks, how­ever, the great­ness of the Ot­tomans lies in their plu­ral­ism, rooted at the very heart of Is­lam and it would in­spire dif­fer­ent moves to­day – per­haps open­ing Ha­gia Sophia to both</p>
    <p>Mus­lim and Chris­tian wor­ship, as I have ad­vised for years.</p>
    <p>An­other would be re­open­ing the Halki Sem­i­nary, a Chris­tian school of the­ol­ogy that opened in 1844 un­der Ot­toman aus­pices, fell vic­tim to sec­u­lar na­tion­al­ism in 1971, but is still closed de­spite calls from ad­vo­cates for re­li­gious free­dom.</p>
    <p>For the broader Mus­lim world, Ha­gia Sophia is a re­minder that our tra­di­tion in­cludes both our ev­er­last­ing faith and val­ues, as well as a legacy of im­pe­ri­al­ism.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter is a bit­ter fact of his­tory, like Chris­tian im­pe­ri­al­ism or na­tion­al­ism, which has tar­geted our mosques and even lives as well – from Cor­doba to Sre­brenica. But to­day, we should try to heal such wounds of the past, not open new ones.</p>
    <p>So, if Mus­lims re­ally want to re­vive some­thing from the past, let’s fo­cus on the model ini­ti­ated by the Prophet and im­ple­mented by Caliph Umar. That means no shrines should be con­verted – or re­con­verted. All re­li­gious tra­di­tions should be re­spected. And the mag­na­nim­ity of tol­er­ance should overcome the pet­ti­ness of supremacis­m.</p>
