    <p>Ger­many’s pres­i­dency of the Euro­pean Union was sup­posed to end on a high note to­day, with Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel chair­ing a sum­mit from which the union was con­fi­dently pre­dicted to emerge strength­ened and more co­he­sive.</p>
    <p>It was all planned to be a fit­ting farewell to the Ger­man leader who is soon plan­ning to re­tire from pol­i­tics af­ter more than 15 years at the helm of Europe’s big­gest and wealth­i­est na­tion.</p>
    <p>But although no­body doubts Dr Merkel’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to en­sure the two-day EU sum­mit which starts to­day in Brus­sels ad­dresses all the union’s ur­gent prob­lems, the task of over­com­ing the fun­da­men­tal di­vi­sions now be­set­ting its 27 mem­ber-states ap­pears daunt­ing.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic con­fronts the EU with its worst eco­nomic cri­sis since its foun­da­tion. Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct through­out the union is fore­cast to fall this year by an av­er­age of around 8.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>And to make mat­ters worse, some of the weak­est EU economies have also been hit hard­est. The fall in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct in Italy is pro­jected at 11 per cent, while in Spain the econ­omy could con­tract by as much as 13 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel was in­stru­men­tal in craft­ing the EU re­sponse, for with­out her de­ci­sion to aban­don her coun­try’s tra­di­tional op­po­si­tion to shar­ing in the bor­row­ing bur­den of fel­low mem­ber-states, not much could have been done to avert a cri­sis which would have cer­tainly threat­ened the very ex­is­tence of the union.</p>
    <p>That has been averted. The EU has agreed on the cre­ation of a mas­sive €750 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) re­cov­ery fund to sus­tain its bat­tered economies, mostly bor­rowed from the fi­nan­cial mar­kets un­der the joint guar­an­tee of all its mem­ber-states, a his­toric first. And it has also agreed on a €1.07 tril­lion bud­get for the next seven years, which again will prop up weaker states.</p>
    <p>The snag is that the adop­tion of these im­pres­sive fi­nan­cial in­stru­ments is now held hostage by a dis­pute over the po­lit­i­cal con­di­tions which could be at­tached to dis­tribut­ing the funds. Many EU mem­ber-states led by France in­sist that former com­mu­nist states such as Poland or Hun­gary may be de­prived of some of the fund­ing un­less they agree to cor­rect what crit­ics say are de­par­tures from demo­cratic norms, such as re­duc­ing the free­dom of the press, or re­strict­ing the in­de­pen­dence of their ju­di­ciary.</p>
    <p>Un­sur­pris­ingly, Poland and Hun­gary re­ject any con­di­tion­al­ity, claim­ing that the EU has no le­gal ba­sis for in­tro­duc­ing such clauses, and that the whole idea of “pun­ish­ing” mem­ber-states on the ba­sis of so-called “rule of law” cri­te­ria which no­body can ac­cu­rately de­fine rep­re­sents a dan­ger­ous prece­dent.</p>
    <p>And, since the ap­proval of all 27 mem­ber-states is re­quired for the adop­tion of the spend­ing pro­pos­als, all the funds have yet to be es­tab­lished.</p>
    <p>Hun­gar­ian Prime Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Vik­tor Or­ban, who flew to the Pol­ish cap­i­tal of War­saw this week to co­or­di­nate the two coun­tries’ stance at to­day’s EU sum­mit, re­mains un­re­pen­tant.</p>
    <p>“We – Poles and Hun­gar­i­ans – are on one side, the Ger­man pres­i­dency is on the other,” he told jour­nal­ists af­ter his War­saw meet­ing.</p>
    <p>“To­gether, we are strong enough to de­fend our fi­nan­cial in­ter­ests. Even if some­thing goes wrong, there is no need to worry be­cause to­gether we have the strength to de­fend our po­si­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>But the Pol­ish gov­ern­ment is com­ing un­der do­mes­tic pres­sure to avoid fur­ther clashes with the rest of the EU and it is strik­ing a more con­cil­ia­tory tone.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one agrees that our veto (on the EU bud­get) re­mains a real op­tion, but we must try to find a com­pro­mise,” said Pol­ish Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Jaroslaw Gowin.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel’s task in Brus­sels over the next two days is to of­fer enough con­ces­sions to Hun­gary and Poland to al­low them to sign off on the bud­get and the EU post-pan­demic re­cov­ery fund, while at the same time clamp­ing down on de­mands of other na­tions to by­pass Hun­gary and Poland al­to­gether by es­tab­lish­ing a fund for Euro­pean re­cov­ery with­out these two mem­ber-states, a move which will ren­der the dam­ag­ing split in­side the union per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>And this task will not be easy, since Dr Merkel her­self is un­der at­tack in Ger­many for hav­ing tol­er­ated for too long the lead­ers of Hun­gary and Poland, both of whom be­long to the cen­tre-right fam­ily of po­lit­i­cal par­ties in</p>
    <p>Europe of which she is the chief pro­po­nent.</p>
    <p>Still, no­body should doubt the Ger­man Chan­cel­lor’s leg­endary at­ten­tion to de­tail and ne­go­ti­at­ing skills, or the huge in­flu­ence which her na­tion can bring to bear in Europe.</p>
    <p>And on a more pos­i­tive side, Dr Merkel has been spared one headache to­day: The seem­ingly in­ter­minable de­bate about Bri­tain’s re­la­tion­ship with the union is off the EU sum­mit’s agenda.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel’s task is to of­fer enough con­ces­sions to Hun­gary and Poland to al­low them to sign off on the bud­get and the EU post-pan­demic re­cov­ery fund, while at the same time clamp­ing down on de­mands of other na­tions to by­pass Hun­gary and Poland al­to­gether by es­tab­lish­ing a fund for Euro­pean re­cov­ery with­out these two mem­ber-states, a move which will ren­der the dam­ag­ing split in­side the union per­ma­nent.</p>
