    <p>So many stay­cays, so lit­tle time. What makes this ho­tel spe­cial? Amara Sanc­tu­ary Re­sort Sen­tosa bagged the Ar­chi­tec­tural Her­itage Awards in 2007 for con­serv­ing colo­nial sol­diers’ quar­ters and turn­ing them into lux­ury suites set amid 3.8ha of rain­for­est and gar­dens.</p>
    <p>Seek­ers of self-care will ap­pre­ci­ate the re­sort’s well­ness op­tions, in­clud­ing a well-equipped gym run by Aileron Well­ness and four pools. Loads of #fit­spo (fit­ness in­spi­ra­tion) photo op­por­tu­ni­ties abound.</p>
    <p>First im­pres­sions?</p>
    <p>Stag­gered check-ins mean I can reg­is­ter only at 3pm. With four other groups milling around in the lobby, staff are kept busy. It takes a while to get the pa­per­work done – I feel re­as­sured when I see that the re­cep­tion staff wear gloves – and ar­rive at my one-bed­room pool villa via buggy.</p>
    <p>Un­like the her­itage build­ings on­site, my villa sports a con­tem­po­rary de­sign. The 2.32m by 2.27m pri­vate pool is flanked by two spa­cious pavil­ions – one houses a king-size bed and the other, a liv­ing room.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the bath­room sits an out­door tub made for two. There is also an out­door din­ing ta­ble for four.</p>
    <p>Please tell us there is a spa.</p>
    <p>But of course. I book a 60-minute Swedish mas­sage at Spa Luna in the morning be­fore check-in. The staff are friendly and my tight mus­cles melt un­der ther­a­pist Shan Shan’s skil­ful strokes.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic re­al­ity check: I am con­fused to find a dis­pos­able bowl with cling wrap at the lounge after my mas­sage. It looks like take­away from a food­court, but is ac­tu­ally the spa’s house­made red bean soup.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>Set­tling into the room takes longer than ex­pected be­cause I have to book my break­fast (to be served in the villa) as well as time slots for the fa­cil­i­ties. I aban­don plans to swim and drive for five min­utes to Sen­tosa Cove for a 6pm din­ner to avoid the crowds.</p>
    <p>Strolling along the board­walk after­wards trans­ports me to my last hol­i­day in Auck­land, when my fam­ily dined har­bour­side and gawked at multi-mil­lion-dol­lar yachts.</p>
    <p>Why sleep in when you can get an early start to the day, right?</p>
    <p>Palawan Beach is a cou­ple of min­utes away by foot – per­fect for a morning run or salt­wa­ter swim be­fore the pic­nick­ers ar­rive.</p>
    <p>I am thrilled when an un­ex­pected en­tourage of four pea­cocks fol­lows me back from my 7am walk.</p>
    <p>The rus­tic DreamPool is empty at 8am, so I do my laps in peace and play with the gi­ant unicorn float with­out any­one judg­ing me (up to five peo­ple can book the use of the pools for each two-hour slot).</p>
    <p>The SkyPool, which boasts gor­geous sea views from the rooftop of the ho­tel’s four-storey block, is undis­turbed at noon and the gym has only one per­son in it. Pity I have to check out in an hour.</p>
    <p>Things that made you go “om”?</p>
    <p>Med­i­tat­ing in the pri­vate plunge pool after din­ner. The water is warm enough to be invit­ing and cool enough to take the edge off the hot after­noon. With the stars above me and ci­cadas singing their evening lul­la­bies, I close my eyes and imag­ine I am back in the Mal­dives. All is good.</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: Bliss or miss?</p>
    <p>While the re­sort is start­ing to show its age, I trea­sure its seren­ity – be­sides the check-in crowd, I hardly bump into big groups dur­ing my stay.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice is ef­fi­cient, but could be warmer, es­pe­cially at the re­cep­tion. A care pack with hand sani­tiser and masks would have been a nice touch too.</p>
    <p>If you can get a good deal, go for the vil­las or Larkhill Ter­race suites – the suites have ex­clu­sive ac­cess to a lovely 44m-long pool.</p>
    <p>To truly re­lax and make use of all the well­ness fa­cil­i­ties, I rec­om­mend book­ing at least two nights.</p>
    <p>This ho­tel is ideal for a ro­man­tic es­cape and fam­i­lies with kids of pre-school age and older too.</p>
    <p>HOT TIP</p>
    <p>Visit the two re­main­ing World War II air-raid shel­ters on Sen­tosa within the grounds, which are part of the ho­tel’s her­itage trail. Both are well-ven­ti­lated and make ideal places to re­flect on ev­ery­thing you are grate­ful for.</p>
