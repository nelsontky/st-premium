    <p>Spain and Italy have or­dered dis­cos to be shut, while Greece has re­stricted hours for bars and restau­rants amid con­cerns that Europe’s sum­mer partying is reignit­ing the spread of Covid-19. As the hol­i­day sea­son winds down, Euro­pean of­fi­cials are wary that re­turn­ing va­ca­tion­ers may be spread­ing the virus at work­places and schools. WORLD</p>
    <p>ROME • Spain and Italy have or­dered the shut­ter­ing of dis­cos and Greece has re­stricted hours for bars and restau­rants amid con­cerns that Europe’s sum­mer partying is reignit­ing the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>As the hol­i­day sea­son grad­u­ally winds down, Euro­pean of­fi­cials are wary about re­turn­ing va­ca­tion­ers spread­ing Covid-19 at work­places and schools. Spain has again emerged as a hot spot, trig­ger­ing new travel warn­ings in an­other blow to the coun­try’s US$175 bil­lion (S$239.6 bil­lion) tourism in­dus­try. In the past 14 days, Spain re­ported 116 new cases per 100,000 peo­ple, ac­cord­ing to data from the Euro­pean Cen­tre for Dis­ease Preven­tion and Con­trol.</p>
    <p>That com­pares with 41 in France, 19 in the UK, 16 in Ger­many and nine in Italy, the orig­i­nal epi­cen­tre of the out­break on the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>Across the re­gion, of­fi­cials are caught be­tween try­ing to fos­ter an eco­nomic re­cov­ery af­ter ac­tiv­ity col­lapsed in the sec­ond quar­ter, and pre­vent­ing a surge in in­fec­tions that could stretch health sys­tems and force even tighter re­stric­tions. “We can­not waste the sac­ri­fices made in the past months,” Ital­ian Health Min­is­ter Roberto Sper­anza wrote in a Face­book post late on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel told a meet­ing of her Chris­tian Demo­cratic Union party yes­ter­day in Ber­lin that ris­ing in­fec­tions in Ger­many are of con­cern, but still man­age­able. There is no scope cur­rently for loos­en­ing re­stric­tions, she said.</p>
    <p>The Ir­ish emer­gency health au­thor­i­ties were set to meet in Dublin yes­ter­day to con­sider new mea­sures to curb the pan­demic af­ter re­port­ing the most daily in­fec­tions since May on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>From Ibiza to the crowded ur­ban nightspots of Madrid, some 25,000 dis­cos and clubs in Spain were strug­gling to emerge from one of Europe’s strictest lock­downs, which ended in June.</p>
    <p>Sus­pend­ing op­er­a­tions again was part of a pack­age of 11 mea­sures the coun­try’s re­gional gov­ern­ments agreed to take to curb the fastest virus growth rate among Europe’s ma­jor economies. The Health Min­istry blamed night-time so­cial­is­ing for fu­elling new out­breaks, cast­ing a shadow over the govern­ment’s seven-week ex­per­i­ment to re­store Spain’s famed nightlife. To­tal cases surged by over 27,000 last week.</p>
    <p>Over the weekend, the Nether­lands raised its travel ad­vi­sory level to orange for three Span­ish re­gions, in­clud­ing Madrid and the pop­u­lar Balearic Is­lands. The ad­vi­sory dis­cour­ages non-es­sen­tial travel and re­quires self-quar­an­tine upon re­turn.</p>
    <p>In France, an in­crease in new cases over the past week – near the alert level in ar­eas such as Paris and Mar­seille – has prompted a push for new mea­sures. The lo­cal au­thor­i­ties have sealed some pub­lic ar­eas such as beaches to pre­vent wild par­ties, with night­clubs closed since midMarch.</p>
    <p>The ban on gath­er­ings of more than 5,000 peo­ple has been ex­tended un­til the end of Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The trends are not get­ting worse ev­ery­where. Bel­gium is see­ing a fall in the daily num­ber of in­fec­tions for the first time since the epi­demic started re­gain­ing strength in the mid­dle of last month, and the UK con­tin­ues to open up an econ­omy that has been hit more than any ma­jor Euro­pean na­tion dur­ing the lock­downs.</p>
