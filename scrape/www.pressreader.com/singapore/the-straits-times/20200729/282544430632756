    <p>Pop­u­lar Hong Kong bak­ery Hang He­ung – which has eight out­lets in the for­mer Bri­tish colony – is open­ing its first over­seas store at Ion Or­chard.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pected to open by the end of next month or early Septem­ber, sub­ject to ren­o­va­tion chal­lenges due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the store, the Hong Kong brand will have a Moon­cake Fes­ti­val Pop-up Kiosk at Raf­fles City from Aug 24 and is of­fer­ing a 15 per cent early bird dis­count on moon­cakes.</p>
    <p>Mr Alvin Ng, di­rec­tor of Hang He­ung Sin­ga­pore, says the de­ci­sion to open an out­let here was due to “pos­i­tive re­sponses from Sin­ga­pore­ans” dur­ing the few “short­term pop-ups” that Hang He­ung has or­gan­ised in the past.</p>
    <p>He adds: “We de­cided to set up a per­ma­nent pres­ence in Sin­ga­pore to delight Sin­ga­pore­ans with our de­lec­ta­ble Chi­nese pas­tries all year round.”</p>
    <p>Asked about the de­ci­sion to open an out­let in a time of eco­nomic un­cer­tainty, Mr Ng says while the pan­demic has been “ex­ceed­ingly dif­fi­cult for many re­tail and F&B busi­nesses”, he says the “spirit of sol­i­dar­ity” shown by Sin­ga­pore­ans makes the con­fec­tionery “hope­ful that things will get back to a new nor­mal soon”.</p>
    <p>“While the ini­tial re­sponse may not be as strong as it could po­ten­tially have been if there was no pan­demic, we are def­i­nitely in this busi­ness for the long term and strive to build and es­tab­lish the Hang He­ung brand in Sin­ga­pore suc­cess­fully.”</p>
    <p>Estab­lished in 1920, Hang He­ung is known for its tra­di­tional Chi­nese pas­tries. To­day, its kitchens in Yuen Long, Hong Kong, pro­duces more than 100 types of prod­ucts, in­clud­ing pop­u­lar ones like its wife cake.</p>
    <p>A tra­di­tional Can­tonese pas­try, it comes with win­ter melon paste fill­ing en­cased within a flaky, pa­per-thin crust made of two types of dough.</p>
    <p>Also pop­u­lar are its crispy egg rolls and its silky smooth moon­cakes.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore con­sumers hes­i­tant to visit the malls can still get their fix by or­der­ing from Hang He­ung’s web­site at hanghe­ungsg.com.</p>
