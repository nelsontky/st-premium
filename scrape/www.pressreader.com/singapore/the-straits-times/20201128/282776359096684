    <p>NAPLES • Napoli hon­oured the mem­ory of Diego Maradona with their en­tire first team wear­ing his iconic No. 10 jer­sey as they took on Croa­t­ian side Ri­jeka in the Europa League on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The emo­tional af­fair was the Serie A club’s first game since the death of their great­est player, who died aged 60 after suf­fer­ing a heart at­tack at his home in Ar­gentina on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Maradona led Napoli to their only two Ital­ian league ti­tles (1987, 1990) and their only ma­jor Euro­pean tro­phy, the 1989 Uefa Cup, and while the San Paolo Sta­dium was empty due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, it was not the case out­side the ground.</p>
    <p>Fans tied hun­dreds of blue-and­white scarves to the rail­ings out­side, chant­ing, “Diego, Diego” and other an­thems. There was also a makeshift shrine, with flow­ers, pic­tures, can­dles and bot­tles of wine laid out.</p>
    <p>In­side the sta­dium, a pic­ture of Maradona was shown on the elec­tronic score­board and ban­ners of him were plas­tered all over.</p>
    <p>Napoli rose to the oc­ca­sion, carv­ing out a 2-0 win, cour­tesy of an own goal by Ar­mando Anas­ta­sio and Hirv­ing Lozano’s strike, al­low­ing them to go top of Group F.</p>
    <p>After­wards, coach Gen­naro Gat­tuso paid homage to Maradona, who he knew per­son­ally.</p>
    <p>“Diego is a leg­end and will never die,” the 2006 World Cup win­ner with Italy said. “He is a leg­end from an­other planet.</p>
    <p>“Since yes­ter­day, you could see that the city breathed a dif­fer­ent at­mos­phere. We hope to ded­i­cate some­thing im­por­tant to him and win a tro­phy. In this city, we have talked about it for too many years.</p>
    <p>“I have so many good mem­o­ries, I had the chance to speak to him many times. He has died but his spirit lives on. He made mis­takes in his pri­vate life but he will al­ways be alive be­cause of what he has achieved.”</p>
    <p>Bel­gium for­ward Dries Mertens, Napoli’s record goalscorer with 128 strikes, ad­mit­ted that the som­bre mood made it “tough to pull that shirt on”, but vowed the club would con­tinue to do jus­tice to</p>
    <p>Maradona’s name.</p>
    <p>“It was an aw­ful mo­ment for me, so I can only imag­ine how those who lived through his time at Napoli must have felt,” he told Sky Sport Italia.</p>
    <p>“He made such a big im­pact on this city and for ev­ery­one in the south of Italy. I want to be pos­i­tive, and fo­cus on my mem­o­ries of a smil­ing man who loved foot­ball.</p>
    <p>“I apol­o­gised to him, be­cause my name was used in the same sen­tence as his and that’s not right. He was and al­ways will be unique.”</p>
    <p>He added on In­sta­gram: “You were the first thing that came to my mind when I signed for Naples. Wear­ing the blue shirt will mean even more from now on.</p>
    <p>“You were, and will al­ways be, an in­spi­ra­tion to all of us. If my name has ever been placed next to yours, I apol­o­gise, I will never be at your level. What you did for ‘our’ city will go down in his­tory for­ever. It was an hon­our to have met you. For­ever my idol.”</p>
    <p>Else­where, Arse­nal and Le­ices­ter se­cured their place in the last 32 of the Europa League fol­low­ing a 3-0 Group B vic­tory and 3-3 Group G draw with Molde and Braga re­spec­tively, while Tot­ten­ham thumped Lu­do­gorets 4-0 in Group J.</p>
