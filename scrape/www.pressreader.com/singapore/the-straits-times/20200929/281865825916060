    <p>YEREVAN/BAKU • At least 21 peo­ple were killed yes­ter­day in a sec­ond day of heavy clashes be­tween Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan over the ter­ri­tory of Nagorno-Karabakh that re­port­edly in­volved air power, mis­siles and heavy ar­mour.</p>
    <p>The fiercest fight­ing in years be­tween the two for­mer Soviet re­publics has re­vived con­cern over sta­bil­ity in the South Cau­ca­sus, a cor­ri­dor for pipe­lines car­ry­ing oil and gas to world mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Any move to an all-out con­flict could drag in ma­jor re­gional pow­ers Rus­sia and Turkey. Mos­cow has a de­fence al­liance with Ar­me­nia, while Ankara backs its eth­nic Tur­kic kin in Azer­bai­jan.</p>
    <p>Ms An­gela Frangyan, a doc­u­men­tary film-maker liv­ing in NagornoKar­abakh’s cap­i­tal Stepanaker­t, said res­i­dents had taken cover in bomb shel­ters and con­stant shelling could be heard.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor­ity-Chris­tian Ar­me­nia and mainly-Mus­lim Azer­bai­jan have come to blows pe­ri­od­i­cally in their decades-long con­flict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a break­away re­gion that is in­side Azer­bai­jan but run by eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans.</p>
    <p>Turkey’s Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan has de­manded that Ar­me­nia im­me­di­ately with­draw from Azeri lands he said it was oc­cu­py­ing and added that it was time to end the Nagorno-Karabakh cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia’s Par­lia­ment con­demned what it said was a “fullscale mil­i­tary at­tack” by Azer­bai­jan on Nagorno-Karabakh that was re­ceiv­ing Turkey’s help.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan de­nied Turkey was tak­ing part in the fight­ing, and has de­clared a par­tial mil­i­tary mo­bil­i­sa­tion. Its for­eign min­is­ter said six Azeri civil­ians had been killed and 19 wounded.</p>
    <p>An Ar­me­nian de­fence min­istry rep­re­sen­ta­tive said 200 Ar­me­ni­ans were wounded, ac­cord­ing to In­ter­fax news agency.</p>
    <p>Nagorno-Karabakh re­ported 15 more of its soldiers had been killed, af­ter say­ing on Sun­day that 16 of its ser­vice­men had been killed and over 100 wounded. It also said it had re­cov­ered some ter­ri­tory it had lost con­trol of on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>In­ter­fax quoted the press sec­re­tary of Azer­bai­jan’s de­fence min­istry, Mr Anar Evya­zov, as say­ing that the Azeri mil­i­tary oc­cu­pied sev­eral strate­gi­cally im­por­tant heights near the vil­lage of Tal­ish.</p>
    <p>“Mis­sile, ar­tillery and air strikes are be­ing ap­plied to the en­emy’s po­si­tions, which forced the en­emy to sur­ren­der the held po­si­tions,” he said, adding that Mr Lernik Babayan, com­man­der of the Ar­me­nian mil­i­tary’s air­borne as­sault bat­tal­ion, had been killed near Tal­ish. It was not im­me­di­ately pos­si­ble to ver­ify the re­port.</p>
    <p>The clashes have spurred a flurry of diplo­macy.</p>
    <p>China urged both sides to show re­straint. Rus­sia called for an im­me­di­ate cease­fire and Turkey said it would sup­port Azer­bai­jan.</p>
    <p>United Na­tions sec­re­tary-gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res said on Sun­day that he was “ex­tremely con­cerned over the fresh re­sump­tion of hos­til­i­ties”. His spokesman said in a state­ment: “The sec­re­tary-gen­eral strongly calls on the sides to im­me­di­ately stop fight­ing, de-es­ca­late ten­sions and re­turn to mean­ing­ful ne­go­ti­a­tions with­out de­lay.”</p>
    <p>Mr Guter­res “con­demns the use of force and re­grets the loss of life and the toll on the civil­ian pop­u­la­tion”, the state­ment said, adding that the UN chief would speak to the Pres­i­dent of Azer­bai­jan and the Prime Min­is­ter of Ar­me­nia.</p>
    <p>France, Ger­many, Italy and the Euro­pean Union also urged an im­me­di­ate cease­fire, while Pope Fran­cis prayed for peace.</p>
    <p>Un­der in­ter­na­tional law, Nagorno-Karabakh is recog­nised as part of Azer­bai­jan but the eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans who make up most of the pop­u­la­tion re­ject Azeri rule.</p>
    <p>They have run their own af­fairs, with sup­port from Ar­me­nia, since Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azer­bai­jan in a con­flict that erupted as the Soviet Union col­lapsed in 1991.</p>
    <p>Al­though a cease­fire was agreed in 1994, Azer­bai­jan and Ar­me­nia fre­quently ac­cuse each other of at­tacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the sep­a­rate Azeri-Ar­me­nian fron­tier.</p>
