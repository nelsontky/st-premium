    <p>Umno, the big­gest party i n Malaysia’s rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion, has called for a gen­eral elec­tion to be held once the surge i n coro­n­avirus cases has abated, fol­low­ing a lengthy de­lib­er­a­tion of top party lead­ers yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Umno has de­cided that the peo­ple’s man­date must be re­turned to form a sta­ble gov­ern­ment by hold­ing elec­tions once the Covid-19 pan­demic is un­der con­trol,” Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi said af­ter the three-hour meet­ing late last night of the Supreme Coun­cil. This was the se­cond such meet­ing of Umno’s top de­ci­sion­mak­ing coun­cil this week.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil con­sists of Umno’s pres­i­dent and top of­fice-bear­ers, as well as state party chiefs.</p>
    <p>There was ear­lier spec­u­la­tion in­di­cat­ing that the party would de­cide yes­ter­day evening on a can­di­date to be named as deputy prime min­is­ter in Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Cab­i­net.</p>
    <p>This was to be among the “fresh de­mands” that Umno wanted in or­der to con­tinue its co­op­er­a­tion with the eight-month-old PN gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Party sources had told the me­dia anony­mously that three names – Umno vice-pres­i­dent and De­fence Min­is­ter Is­mail Sabri Yaakob, For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein and Umno deputy pres­i­dent Mo­hamad Hasan – were sup­pos­edly in the run­ning as Umno’s choice for deputy prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>But the state­ment dis­trib­uted to the me­dia at the end of the meet­ing yes­ter­day made no men­tion re­gard­ing the cre­ation of a deputy prime min­is­ter’s post, or whether the is­sue was dis­cussed by the coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri’s Muhyid­din’s Cab­i­net has four se­nior min­is­ters, but no deputy prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Zahid, in his state­ment, called on ex­ist­ing Umno Cab­i­net mem­bers “to re­main in gov­ern­ment” and con­tinue to “take care of peo­ple’s wel­fare and de­fend the party’s dig­nity”. He said the party is com­mit­ted to a “po­lit­i­cal truce” and “na­tional rec­on­cil­i­a­tion” amid a rise in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, an­other Supreme Coun­cil meet­ing saw the party de­lib­er­at­ing on whether to con­tinue back­ing Mr Muhyid­din as prime min­is­ter. It de­cided to con­tinue to back the 13-party PN coali­tion in its cur­rent form.</p>
    <p>Umno lead­ers have con­sis­tently men­tioned the party’s need to have more strate­gic po­si­tions in the cur­rent gov­ern­ment and had threat­ened to with­draw sup­port for Mr Muhyid­din if these de­mands were not met.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s PN has 113 seats in the 222-seat Par­lia­ment, with a nar­row two-seat ma­jor­ity. The un­cer­tainty over the Pre­mier’s ma­jor­ity saw him seek emer­gency pow­ers from the Malaysian King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, last week in or­der to pass a cru­cial fed­eral bud­get. But the re­quest was re­jected by the palace on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Zahid’s state­ment in­di­cated that Umno, with 39 MPs, will back Bud­get 2021 which will be tabled in Par­lia­ment next Fri­day.</p>
