    <p>A study last year found that close to a fifth of im­ported and lo­cally farmed fresh pro­duce – in­clud­ing fish and other seafood – is lost along the food sup­ply chain here every year, amount­ing to a loss of $2.54 bil­lion. In this sec­ond in­stal­ment of a six-part se­ries on food waste, The Sun­day Times, in part­ner­ship with DBS Bank, dives into a fish farm. Ju­dith Tan and Vanessa Liu ex­plore how the farm’s waste is raw ma­te­rial for a restau­rant as the food in­dus­try pushes to­wards zero food waste.</p>
    <p>It is no fishy busi­ness to say that from the mo­ment a fish is har­vested to the time it lands on your plate, about 30 per cent of it would have been lost as waste. With today’s af­flu­ence and pref­er­ence for the con­ve­nience of a fish fil­let, this pro­por­tion can some­times dou­ble.</p>
    <p>“A fil­leted fish is eas­ier to store and freeze if you do not plan to eat it on the same day. It is eas­ier and faster to pre­pare, as well as eas­ier and faster to eat, since there is no need to worry about bones. Today’s con­sumers want this con­ve­nience,” says Mr Mal­colm Ong, chief ex­ec­u­tive of fish­ery com­pany The Fish Farmer.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong, 57, started to work last year with Hai Sia Seafood, one of the largest seafood pro­ces­sors in Sin­ga­pore, to have the grey mul­let, one of the species he farms off the coast of Lim Chu Kang, pro­cessed into fil­lets and sold at su­per­mar­kets such as FairPrice.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to The Fish Farmer’s web­site, grey mul­let is an oil-rich fish that is high in omega-3 fatty acids and vi­ta­mins. Its meat is of a medium to firm tex­ture and has a rich, dis­tinc­tive flavour.</p>
    <p>The fish can be pre­pared in many ways – in­clud­ing steam­ing, grilling and pan-fry­ing – and is a favourite among Teochews.</p>
    <p>For Mr Ong, it makes busi­ness sense to send 3,000kg of mul­let a day to Hai Sia Seafood to be fil­leted, but it wor­ried him to see the of­f­cuts, com­pris­ing the head, bones, trim­mings and the rest of the meat, be­ing thrown away.</p>
    <p>“The fil­let is just meat. It makes up only 40 per cent of the en­tire fish. So the rest of the fish – 60 per cent – would have been thrown away. Th­ese are per­fectly good parts of the fish,” he says.</p>
    <p>Food waste is one of the big­gest waste streams in Sin­ga­pore, and the amount of food wastage gen­er­ated has bal­looned by about 20 per cent over the past 10 years.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency es­ti­mates that 40 per cent of food waste gen­er­ated here is from the com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial sec­tors that han­dle fish, other seafood and veg­eta­bles.</p>
    <p>Last year alone saw around 744 mil­lion kg of food wasted. That is equiv­a­lent to two bowls of rice a per­son a day, or the weight of about 50,000 dou­ble-decker buses.</p>
    <p>A study by the Sin­ga­pore En­vi­ron­ment Coun­cil and con­sul­tancy firm Deloitte Sin­ga­pore last year found that the fish and seafood sec­tor con­trib­uted the sec­ond-largest vol­ume of food loss, at about 25,000 tonnes a year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to mar­ket and con­sumer data provider Statista, more than 125,000 tonnes of seafood was im­ported to Sin­ga­pore, and ap­prox­i­mately 5,340 tonnes was pro­duced here last year. About 124,200 tonnes was con­sumed, trans­lat­ing to about 21kg a per­son.</p>
    <p>World Wide Fund for Na­ture (WWF) Sin­ga­pore’s head of mar­ket trans­for­ma­tion Stefanie Bei­tien says how food is pro­duced and con­sumed is the big­gest threat to the planet today.</p>
    <p>De­spite the high en­vi­ron­men­tal cost of food pro­duc­tion, a third of all food pro­duced goes to waste.</p>
    <p>“Seafood sup­ply chains are of­ten long and com­plex, span­ning busi­nesses across fish­eries, aqua­cul­ture, sup­pli­ers, re­tail­ers and end con­sumers. Food loss and waste hap­pens at every stage across this value chain, so any mea­sure that re­duces the dis­tance be­tween farm to fork helps,” Ms Bei­tien says.</p>
    <p>Proper pro­cess­ing meth­ods, ac­cess to good stor­age fa­cil­i­ties and im­proved cold chain man­age­ment pre­vent food loss and waste, she says.</p>
    <p>At farm level, sus­tain­able aqua­cul­ture pro­duc­tion prac­tices that min­imise en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact and en­hance ef­fi­cient use of re­sources can con­trib­ute to higher sur­vival rates of farmed fish.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies along the seafood sup­ply chain should set tar­gets that track and mea­sure food waste from source through point of sale.</p>
    <p>“Ad­dress­ing food waste, in turn, re­duces pres­sure on nat­u­ral re­sources while in­creas­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity and de­creas­ing price volatil­ity,” Ms Bei­tien says.</p>
    <p>WWF-Sin­ga­pore is work­ing with busi­nesses across the seafood in­dus­try here to help them adopt sus­tain­able sourc­ing prac­tices and im­prove over­all in­dus­try stan­dards, she says.</p>
    <p>As early as 2016, busi­nesses such as re­tail­ers, res­tau­rants, hotels and seafood sup­pli­ers came to­gether with WWF-Sin­ga­pore to crowd­source in­dus­try so­lu­tions at a Sus­tain­able Seafood Busi­ness Fo­rum.</p>
    <p>The same fo­rum also kick­started the Re­spon­si­ble Seafood Group, com­pris­ing lo­cal in­dus­try lead­ers such as lo­gis­tics oper­a­tor Global Ocean­link and in­te­grated re­sort Ma­rina Bay Sands.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with WWF-Sin­ga­pore, they com­mit to re­spon­si­ble sourc­ing stan­dards and pave the way for the rest of the in­dus­try to fol­low suit.</p>
    <p>Says Ms Bei­tien says: “Restau­ra­teurs, re­tail­ers and the F&B (food and bev­er­age) in­dus­try have in­flu­ence over shap­ing con­sumer pref­er­ences. As ‘nose to tail’ and ‘root to stem’ cook­ing are al­ready pop­u­lar culi­nary con­cepts, the ‘fin to gill’ ap­proach can be eas­ily adopted by the</p>
    <p>seafood in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“The in­dus­try can cre­ate prod­ucts with of­f­cuts, such as broth or chow­der. Even non-valu­able fish can be turned into soap, glyc­erol or fer­tilis­ers.</p>
    <p>“Shell waste from crabs, shrimps and krill are the main sources for the ex­trac­tion of chitin and chi­tosan, which are used in the bio­med­i­cal, cos­metic and food in­dus­tries.”</p>
    <p>NOT ALL IS WASTED</p>
    <p>The loss, says Mr Ong, be­gins as far up­stream as the fish farms – when fish are at the fry stage.</p>
    <p>Every year, his farm buys be­tween one mil­lion and 1.5 mil­lion mul­let fry at 20 cents each, which comes up to about $300,000. By the time the mul­let ma­ture and are ready for the din­ner ta­ble at 18 months, half of the fry would not have made it, he says.</p>
    <p>Add to that the loss of as much as 1,800kg of of­f­cuts from the 3,000kg of mul­let pro­cessed into fil­lets daily, “and such wastage is too high”, says Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>Things changed after he was put in touch with Ms Anna Lim, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of home-grown restau­rant chain The Soup Spoon.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber that Kenny in­tro­duced us, want­ing us to col­lab­o­rate and up­cy­cle raw prod­ucts to cut food waste,” says Mr Ong, re­fer­ring to Mr Kenny Eng, 46 – di­rec­tor of hor­ti­cul­tural busi­ness Nyee Phoe Group and its Gar­de­na­sia arm – whose per­sonal pas­sion is to en­cour­age the use of lo­cally pro­duced foods and up­cy­cling of food waste.</p>
    <p>“It was also his pet pro­ject to get lo­cal farm­ers and busi­nesses to work to­gether. It was then that we brain­stormed and came up with the idea of us­ing the of­f­cuts to make soup,” Mr Ong adds.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, 45, says: “Typ­i­cally, cus­tomers would pay top dol­lar for fresh fish fil­lets, but th­ese parts are gen­er­ally limited.</p>
    <p>“Then if the farmer is lucky, he may be able sell off some of the of­f­cuts and bones at a much re­duced price, but most of the time, they are thrown away, as the cost of ware­hous­ing is very high in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“There is still a lot of meat cling­ing to the bones of the of­f­cuts, and it does not make sense to turn th­ese into stock.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing worked on sim­i­lar projects over­seas, Ms Lim says she wanted to do more for Sin­ga­pore brands and pro­duce.</p>
    <p>“It was in 2018 that I met Mal­colm, and we wanted to see how we could col­lab­o­rate on a plat­form to show­case lo­cal pro­duce. Through this plat­form, lever­ag­ing The Soup Spoon brand and our ex­per­tise in mak­ing soups and stews, we are able to up­cy­cle the of­f­cuts to cre­ate de­li­cious recipes and show­case lo­cal pro­duce and the work of lo­cal farm­ers and (get) bet­ter mar­gins for them,” she says. The Soup Spoon pro­cesses about 7.2 tonnes of fish of­f­cuts and 10.8 tonnes of chicken of­f­cuts a year to cre­ate stocks, soups and chow­ders. Ms Lim says that for their part­ner­ship, The Fish Farmer pro­vides the odd parts and bones “while we cre­ate the recipe, process the fish and cre­ate take-home soup packs fea­tur­ing both the farmer and the pro­duce on the pack”, pro­duc­ing batches of 250 packs in seven work­ing days.</p>
    <p>“With this col­lab­o­ra­tion, we man­aged to cut the wastage (of the mul­let) by 50 per cent and re­duce our car­bon foot­print, but we are not stop­ping there. We are still look­ing for ways to do more,” Ms Lim says.</p>
    <p>Ms Bei­tien says busi­nesses that make re­spon­si­ble de­ci­sions have the po­ten­tial to cre­ate pos­i­tive en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact at scale. This is par­tic­u­larly cru­cial in the food in­dus­try, which han­dles large vol­umes of food daily.</p>
    <p>“While the use of of­f­cuts is a cre­ative and cost-ef­fec­tive so­lu­tion, it is also im­por­tant that this is cou­pled with other sus­tain­able prac­tices, such as well-man­aged in­ven­to­ries, por­tion con­trol and pur­chas­ing re­spon­si­bly sourced seafood,” she says.</p>
