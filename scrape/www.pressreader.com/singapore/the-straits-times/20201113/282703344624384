    <p>EM­BRAC­ING TAI­WAN?: Hong Kong ac­tor An­thony Wong has sparked spec­u­la­tion that he is mov­ing to Tai­wan af­ter he said on so­cial me­dia that he is back on the is­land.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the 59-year-old ac­tor posted on Face­book pho­tos of the ho­tel room where he is serv­ing his quar­an­tine. He wrote: “I am in Tai­wan. An­other 14 days.”</p>
    <p>Wong is one of the few Hong Kong ac­tors who have been openly sup­port­ive of the pro-democ­racy move­ment in the Chi­nese ter­ri­tory. As a re­sult, his act­ing ca­reer has been se­verely af­fected af­ter he was black­listed by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Wong, who is known for act­ing in movies such as The Un­told Story (1993), Beast Cops (1998) and In­fer­nal Af­fairs (2002), re­vealed in May while he was in Tai­wan that he had con­sid­ered mov­ing to the is­land, or even to Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>His late fa­ther Fred­er­ick Perry was Bri­tish, but he was brought up by his Can­tonese mother in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Wong’s as­sis­tant told the Tai­wanese me­dia that he is in Tai­wan to film a re­al­ity show and will be there for about two months. She added that the ac­tor’s cur­rent pri­or­ity is work and not im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>She said Wong did con­sider stay­ing long-term in Tai­wan and will con­sider rent­ing a house first be­fore buy­ing one there.</p>
