    <p>•</p>
    <p>K-pop singer Chungha has been hit by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The for­mer mem­ber of girl group I.O.I tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Mon­day, prompt­ing other K-pop artists who had close con­tact with her to go for test­ing as well.</p>
    <p>The mem­bers of pop­u­lar K-pop girl group Twice were among those who went for Covid-19 tests as group mem­ber Sana had met Chungha just last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>All nine mem­bers of Twice as well as the group’s staff tested neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus late on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Chungha, 24, also re­cently met Cos­mic Girls’ Yeon­jung, Gugu­dan’s</p>
    <p>Mina and DIA’s Chaeyeon. All three have also tested neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Chungha had been due to re­lease her sin­gle, X, to­mor­row be­fore re­leas­ing her first full-length al­bum Queren­cia next month.</p>
    <p>She said in a post: “I’m so sorry again and again. I’ve tried to be cau­tious, but I think I needed to be more so. I’ll come back after fully re­cov­er­ing.”</p>
    <p>In ac­cor­dance with of­fi­cial health guide­lines in South Korea, Sana, 23, will be quar­an­tined till next Fri­day. But the other mem­bers of Twice can still con­tinue their ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Chungha (above) tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Mon­day, prompt­ing Twice (left), whose mem­ber Sana had close con­tact with her, to go for test­ing too. All nine mem­bers of the group tested neg­a­tive late on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the singers, staff at the Mnet Asian Mu­sic Awards, which was held on Sun­day, were also tested as Twice had per­formed on the show.</p>
    <p>The group won the Most Pop­u­lar Artist award and was in the top 10 of the World­wide Fans Choice cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>There has been a spate of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in the K-pop in­dus­try re­cently.</p>
    <p>Two mem­bers of boy band Up10­tion, two mem­bers of girl group Ever­glow and singer Lee Chan-won, who spe­cialises in an older folk mu­sic genre called trot, tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 last week.</p>
