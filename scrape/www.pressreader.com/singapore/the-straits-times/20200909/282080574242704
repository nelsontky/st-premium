    <p>There have been a few Fo­rum let­ters re­cently which touched on cus­tomer ser­vice ex­pe­ri­ence, and I agree with the points raised (Em­power staff to func­tion ef­fi­ciently, by Mr Jef­frey Law Lee Beng, Sept 7; Sim­pler re­fund process needed at FairPrice stores, by Ms Amanda Ruiqing Flynn, Sept 4; and Sim­plify ap­pli­ca­tion process for fi­nan­cial aid, by Ms Nurin Nazu­rah Sai­fudin, Aug 13).</p>
    <p>Such en­coun­ters il­lus­trate a need to de­sign a highly cus­tomer-cen­tric ser­vice process in many stores in Sin­ga­pore. They show that we are still lag­ging be­hind in terms of cus­tomer ser­vice ex­pe­ri­ence, which is key to re­tain­ing cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>The is­sues the let­ters raised were sim­i­lar – a dis­con­nect in ser­vice as a re­sult of red tape, pro­cesses and stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures, poor help from as­sis­tants, or bar­ri­ers when at­tempt­ing to get a re­fund.</p>
    <p>When I was in Aus­tralia, I saw how ser­vice staff there took pride in en­sur­ing they pro­vided the best cus­tomer ser­vice ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Here in Sin­ga­pore, amid work-from-home ar­range­ments as a re­sult of the Covid-19 pan­demic, we can still find in­stances of a lack of cus­tomer-cen­tric cul­ture in ser­vice de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Take the ex­am­ple of Mr Ong Kok Lam, who re­quested that NTUC mail its 50th an­niver­sary com­mem­o­ra­tive share­holder vouch­ers to his home as he wanted to avoid go­ing out to col­lect them amid the pan­demic (NTUC should send share­holder vouch­ers by mail, Aug 31). His re­quest was de­clined, with NTUC sug­gest­ing that he au­tho­rise a third party to col­lect the vouch­ers on his be­half.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one has a part to play in curb­ing the spread of Covid-19 and Mr Ong’s re­quest was rea­son­able.</p>
    <p>We can cer­tainly do more to im­prove our ser­vice stan­dards.</p>
