    <p>PropNex Friends is an ex­clu­sive mem­ber­ship pro­gramme aimed at rais­ing con­sumer aware­ness and fos­ter­ing a deeper un­der­stand­ing of the real es­tate mar­ket. By of­fer­ing the lat­est in­for­ma­tion and mar­ket anal­y­sis in the sec­tor, con­sumers would be in a bet­ter po­si­tion to make sound and in­formed de­ci­sions as they em­bark on their prop­erty pur­chase or in­vest­ment jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Over the years, PropNex has cham­pi­oned con­sumer ed­u­ca­tion, in­tro­duc­ing ini­tia­tives such as prop­erty sem­i­nars. In Oc­to­ber, it joined Me­di­a­corp and 99.co to or­gan­ise the Sin­ga­pore Prop­erty Show 2020. The suc­cess­ful four-week event gar­nered over 1 mil­lion in reach via the of­fi­cial web­site and var­i­ous so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>PropNex’s Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Of­fi­cer Is­mail Gafoor said: “The Covid-19 pan­demic has brought about a par­a­digm shift in the way con­sumers view and pur­chase prop­er­ties. We have ob­served that peo­ple are in­creas­ingly tak­ing a more proac­tive ap­proach in seek­ing in­for­ma­tion and assess­ing in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties, by at­tend­ing we­bi­nars and view­ing mul­ti­ple prop­er­ties vir­tu­ally be­fore short­list­ing at­trac­tive op­tions.</p>
    <p>“With the in­tro­duc­tion of PropNex Friends, we are build­ing a com­mu­nity where mem­bers can en­joy the best things in life. Be­yond get­ting well-cu­rated con­tent on the lat­est in real es­tate, they will also en­joy life­style re­lated con­tent and spe­cial priv­i­leges from PropNex as we be­come part of their real es­tate jour­ney.”</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore has achieved a high home­own­er­ship rate of about 91% and for many Sin­ga­pore­ans, hous­ing plays a key role in their re­tire­ment se­cu­rity. It is also a de­sire of many peo­ple to own and live in a pri­vate prop­erty. Hence, hous­ing is likely a topic that is close to ev­ery­one’s hearts,” Mr Is­mail added.</p>
    <p>“Over the past 20 years, PropNex has, in big and small ways, helped Sin­ga­pore­ans ob­tain their dream home or start in­vest­ing in prop­er­ties. We are de­lighted to have been part of those jour­neys and look for­ward to</p>
    <p>An exciting Grand Lucky Draw in cel­e­bra­tion of PropNex’s 20th An­niver­sary</p>
    <p>con­tinue to be the trusted real es­tate ad­vi­sor to con­sumers for many more years to come.”</p>
    <p>GRAND LUCKY DRAW</p>
    <p>As part of its 20th an­niver­sary cel­e­bra­tions, PropNex will be host­ing a grand lucky draw with 10 prizes to be given away. The grand prize is a new one-bed­room con­do­minium unit with a study at Trea­sure At Tampines, a mega devel­op­ment by Sim Lian</p>
    <p>Devel­op­ment Pte Ltd and Sim Lian Land Pte Ltd. This devel­op­ment was the best-sell­ing new condo project in 2019 and con­tin­ued to top the sales chart for the first 10 months of 2020. The rest of the nine prizes are cash prizes of up to $50,000.</p>
    <p>Only PropNex Friends mem­bers who are Sin­ga­pore­ans or Sin­ga­pore Per­ma­nent Res­i­dents aged 18 and above are el­i­gi­ble to par­tic­i­pate in the grand lucky draw. They can in­crease their chances (capped at 20 chances) of win­ning by re­fer­ring other friends to join the PropNex Friends mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>Full terms and con­di­tions are avail­able on the PropNex web­site. Win­ners of the Grand Lucky Draw will be an­nounced on June 27, 2021.</p>
