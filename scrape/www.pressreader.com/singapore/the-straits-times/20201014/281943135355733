    <p>GUANG­DONG • Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping has urged a greater fo­cus on qual­ity to over­come in­creased global un­cer­tainty, as he be­gan a sweep through China’s south­ern man­u­fac­tur­ing pow­er­house of Guang­dong prov­ince.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese leader made his lat­est pitch for “self-reliance” on Mon­day dur­ing a visit to the Chaozhou Three-Cir­cle Group, ac­cord­ing to the of­fi­cial Xin­hua news agency.</p>
    <p>He told work­ers at the Shen­zhen-listed com­pany, which pro­duces ad­vanced ce­ram­ics for most ma­jor Chi­nese mo­bile phone mak­ers, to grasp the lead­er­ship’s in­ten­tions and find places in China’s “grand strat­egy”.</p>
    <p>“Cur­rently, we are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing changes un­seen in a cen­tury, and we need to set our­selves on a path to higher qual­ity self-reliance,” Mr Xi said, in an oft-used al­lu­sion to US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s “Amer­ica First” poli­cies.</p>
    <p>“Self-de­pen­dent in­no­va­tion is key for en­ter­prises’ growth, in­dus­try up­grad­ing and high-qual­ity eco­nomic devel­op­ment.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi’s trip through the Pearl River Delta, which has an an­nual eco­nomic out­put larger than In­done­sia’s, was ex­pected to bol­ster his Greater Bay Area plan to build the re­gion into a global tech­nol­ogy hub.</p>
    <p>The Greater Bay Area devel­op­ment scheme aims to in­te­grate Hong Kong, Ma­cau, Shen­zhen, Guangzhou and seven other ma­jor Guang­dong cities and trans­form the south­ern Chi­nese re­gion into an eco­nomic pow­er­house.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi was slated to out­line his lat­est poli­cies to­day in a speech in Shen­zhen to mark the 40th an­niver­sary of the city’s es­tab­lish­ment as a spe­cial eco­nomic zone.</p>
    <p>China’s trade war with the United States and the pan­demic­driven eco­nomic down­turn have in­creased the ur­gency of Bei­jing’s ef­forts to in­crease lo­cal con­sump­tion and close the tech­nol­ogy gap in strate­gic in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, Mr Xi has urged a shift to a “dual-cir­cu­la­tion” econ­omy fu­elled by do­mes­tic growth and sup­ple­mented by for­eign tech­nol­ogy and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi is also sched­uled to meet the lead­ers of Hong Kong and Ma­cau as he seeks to lever­age the for­mer colonies’ sep­a­rate trade and le­gal sys­tems to help make the broader re­gion more com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The Com­mu­nist Party in­tends to build Shen­zhen into a “so­cial­ist pi­lot zone with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics” over the next five years.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam this week said “there need not be di­rect com­pe­ti­tion be­tween Hong Kong and Shen­zhen” as her gov­ern­ment works to boost an econ­omy pushed into re­ces­sion by Covid-19 and months of protests against China’s in­creas­ing grip.</p>
    <p>“We have free­dom of cap­i­tal flow and cur­rency ex­change, a le­gal sys­tem in line with in­ter­na­tional stan­dards and a large pool of pro­fes­sional tal­ent,” Mrs Lam told Shen­zhen Satel­lite TV.</p>
    <p>“These can com­ple­ment Shen­zhen’s tech­no­log­i­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties and ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing.”</p>
    <p>The ex­port-ori­ented re­form and open­ing-up of Shen­zhen has trans­formed the once-sleepy fish­ing vil­lage into a bustling me­trop­o­lis of more than 13 mil­lion peo­ple. It is home to nu­mer­ous multi­na­tional com­pa­nies in­clud­ing Huawei Tech­nolo­gies and Ten­cent Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi yesterday also in­spected the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army Navy Marine Corps in Chaozhou in Guang­dong, and stressed the aim to build it into an elite force.</p>
