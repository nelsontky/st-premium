    <p>With Na­tional Day around the cor­ner, there is no bet­ter time to cel­e­brate made-in-Sin­ga­pore mu­sic.</p>
    <p>This month’s se­lec­tion of home-grown mu­sic picks in­cludes new Sin­ga­pore-themed songs re­leased to co­in­cide with the na­tion’s birth­day.</p>
    <p>Be­sides fresh tracks such as Nathan Hartono’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) theme song Ev­ery­thing I Am and its remix by Don Rich­mond, as well as Char­lie Lim’s Room At The Ta­ble, there are also reimag­in­ings of clas­sic na­tional songs such as One Peo­ple, One Na­tion, One Sin­ga­pore by mu­si­cians that in­clude jazz stal­wart Jeremy Mon­teiro.</p>
    <p>1 ELEC­TRO POP CLEARLY THE BEST YOU</p>
    <p>JJ Neo</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms</p>
    <p>Singer-ac­tress JJ Neo’s (left) new sin­gle, Clearly The Best You, is a re­minder to ap­pre­ci­ate your home town, loved ones, friends and me­mories when you are down or feel­ing iso­lated.</p>
    <p>As she ex­plains in a press state­ment, “be­ing by your­self in the city, or be­ing by your­self at home, you’re never alone”.</p>
    <p>The song is a fol­low-up to No Time, her last sin­gle re­leased in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>2 CLAS­SI­CAL/POP</p>
    <p>TRIP­TYCH SE­RIES The Teng En­sem­ble Watch it on: bit.ly/teng-trip­tych</p>
    <p>Chi­nese fusion mu­sic group The Teng En­sem­ble pays trib­ute to the mi­grant com­mu­nity with a three­part video se­ries, Trip­tych Se­ries, that high­lights the com­mu­nity’s con­tri­bu­tion to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The project marks the first time the group is work­ing with an In­dian artist – Sin­ga­pore mu­sic stal­wart Shabir (above, right).</p>
    <p>He fea­tures on Thedi­choru (In Search Of The Next Meal) and Child­hood, both of which have lyrics based on famed Tamil poet Bharathi­yar’s works.</p>
    <p>The third track, Xin Zao Beh, a rein­ter­pre­ta­tion of Nanyin clas­sic Eight Horses, cel­e­brates the cul­tural her­itage passed down from Sin­ga­pore­ans’ mi­grant an­ces­tors.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>NA­TIONAL DAY PA­RADE THEME</p>
    <p>ONE PEO­PLE, ONE NA­TION, ONE SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>Jeremy Mon­teiro, SAF Band,</p>
    <p>Ale­may Fer­nan­dez, Fari­dah Ali, Jacintha Abishe­ganaden,</p>
    <p>Stephen Fran­cis and Cle­ment Chow</p>
    <p>Watch it on: bit.ly/2XhqCku</p>
    <p>To mark the 30th an­niver­sary of One Peo­ple, One Na­tion, One Sin­ga­pore, the song’s com­poser Jeremy Mon­teiro has teamed up with the</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces Band for a new in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the Na­tional Day clas­sic.</p>
    <p>The mu­sic video, with each mu­si­cian record­ing his or her part re­motely, fea­tures jazz singer Ale­may Fer­nan­dez on lead vo­cals. It also brings back the artists who sang the orig­i­nal ver­sion – Fari­dah Ali, Jacintha Abishe­ganaden, Stephen Fran­cis and Cle­ment Chow – on the rous­ing cho­rus.</p>
    <p>First used as the theme song for the 1990 Na­tional Day Pa­rade, the lyrics were writ­ten by former ad­man Jim Aitchi­son.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>NA­TIONAL DAY PA­RADE THEME</p>
    <p>COUNT ON ME SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>Cle­ment Chow and Band Di­rec­tors’ As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore)</p>
    <p>Watch it at: bit.ly/3kcedbt</p>
    <p>Four hun­dred Sin­ga­pore wind band mu­si­cians, based here and abroad, have come to­gether for the new mu­sic video of Count On Me Sin­ga­pore by Band Di­rec­tors’ As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore). It fea­tures Cle­ment Chow, the orig­i­nal singer of the 1986 NDP favourite.</p>
    <p>The on­line mu­sic video, which fea­tures pro­fes­sion­als from the Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Or­ches­tra, Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces Band and the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force Band, as well as stu­dent mu­si­cians, will be launched to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>FOLK</p>
    <p>ROOM AT THE TA­BLE</p>
    <p>Char­lie Lim</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/3jTEXNJ</p>
    <p>When singer-song­writer Char­lie Lim (right) sang the 2018 NDP theme song, a re­make of We Are Sin­ga­pore, he added a new pre­lude.</p>
    <p>He has now taken that short verse and ex­panded it into an en­tire song, Room At The Ta­ble.</p>
    <p>“We had many re­quests to turn it into its own song and it’s some­thing I’d been sit­ting on for a while be­cause I felt I had more to say,” he wrote on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Stripped down to just Lim’s con­tem­pla­tive singing and wist­ful gui­tars, the lyrics cel­e­brate di­ver­sity and in­clu­sive­ness.</p>
    <p>He will do­nate pro­ceeds from the song to Tran­sient Work­ers Count 2 (TWC2) and It­srain­ingrain­coats, or­gan­i­sa­tions that aid mi­grant work­ers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>EV­ERY­THING POP I AM Nathan Hartono Watch it on: bit.ly/2PeaI5T</p>
    <p>Com­posed as a trib­ute to “the Sin­ga­pore spirit of to­geth­er­ness”, this year’s NDP theme song Ev­ery­thing I Am is sung by singer-song­writer Nathan Hartono (right).</p>
    <p>“Show me how I should be strong/Teach me that I can be weak,” the Sin­ga­porean croons in the song com­posed by Joshua Wan.</p>
    <p>The mu­sic video, di­rected by film-maker He Shum­ing, fea­tures a range of Sin­ga­pore­ans, from health­care work­ers to lo­cal deaf dance crew Redea­f­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Mu­sic di­rec­tor, com­poser and pro­ducer Don Rich­mond has also done an up­beat remix of the song for par­tic­i­pants of the #GetAc­tiveSG 2020 Na­tional Day Work­out (bit.ly/31bGJRK).</p>
    <p>7 MAN­DOPOP</p>
    <p>HOME SWEET HOME Tingzhi.Hz</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean singer-song­writer Tingzhi.Hz’s (above) lat­est sin­gle, Home Sweet Home, is an ode to Sin­ga­pore and a cel­e­bra­tion of the coun­try’s 55th birth­day.</p>
    <p>“It is here where I find safety, se­cu­rity and peace. I am able to pur­sue and ful­fil my dreams as ev­ery­one is treated equally. It is here where I call home sweet home,” the Jo­hor-born singer says in a press state­ment.</p>
    <p>8 AL­TER­NA­TIVE POP FLAGS</p>
    <p>Inch fea­tur­ing ShiGGa Shay Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms Watch it on: bit.ly/33gH1JS</p>
    <p>Singer-song­writer Inch (above) teams up with fel­low home-grown artist, rap­per ShiGGa Shay, for her lat­est sin­gle, Flags.</p>
    <p>Inch, who is also work­ing on her full-length al­bum, says of their col­lab­o­ra­tion: “He is like a younger brother to me and we have col­lab­o­rated on a num­ber of oc­ca­sions. How­ever, this is the first time he’s jump­ing on a track of mine and it feels nice to be able to share this with him.”</p>
    <p>Billed as a com­men­tary on the state of af­fairs, the song ques­tions how peo­ple should re­act when it seems like the world is fail­ing them.</p>
    <p>9 POP SE­MOGA BA­HA­GIA</p>
    <p>Aisyah Aziz, Ben­jamin Kheng, Narelle Kheng and Shabir</p>
    <p>Watch it on: bit.ly/316g2he</p>
    <p>If you went to school in Sin­ga­pore, you will be fa­mil­iar with Se­moga Ba­ha­gia (May You Achieve Hap­pi­ness), a song that has been the of­fi­cial Chil­dren’s Day an­them since 1970.</p>
    <p>The ever­green tune by na­tional an­them com­poser Zu­bir Said gets an up­date from four young artists – (clock­wise from top left) Aisyah Aziz, Ben­jamin Kheng, Narelle Kheng and Shabir. The mu­sic was ar­ranged by com­poser and con­duc­tor Sul­wyn Lok.</p>
    <p>The mu­sic video, helmed by di­rec­tor Shoki Lin, fea­tures Sin­ga­porean youth who went above and be­yond to help those badly af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>10 MAN­DOPOP NO FILTER</p>
    <p>JJ Lin (fea­tur­ing</p>
    <p>Hiroshi Fu­ji­wara)</p>
    <p>Hear it on: Spo­tify, Ap­ple Mu­sic and other mu­sic stream­ing plat­forms</p>
    <p>Watch it on: bit.ly/2Pe4inp</p>
    <p>Man­dopop star JJ Lin (above) col­lab­o­rates with Ja­panese mu­si­cian and street-wear roy­alty Hiroshi Fu­ji­wara in the dreamy new sin­gle, No Filter.</p>
    <p>Be­sides com­pos­ing the song to­gether with Lin, Fu­ji­wara, who runs fash­ion brand Frag­ment De­sign, also de­signed the sin­gle’s art­work. It fea­tures a pho­to­graph of the sky and clouds that Fu­ji­wara took on a flight. The lyrics are by former Da Mouth singer Harry Chang.</p>
    <p>Lin is ex­pected to re­lease a full al­bum later this year.</p>
