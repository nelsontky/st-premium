    <p>Cer­tifi­cate of en­ti­tle­ment (COE) pre­mi­ums ended mixed in the first ten­der of the year yes­ter­day, with prices hardly changed from the pre­vi­ous ten­der two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>The COE price for cars up to 1,600cc and 130bhp fin­ished 0.1 per cent higher at $40,609. The premium for cars above 1,600cc or 130bhp closed 0.6 per cent lower at $49,001.</p>
    <p>The premium for the Open COE – which can be used for any ve­hi­cle type ex­cept mo­tor­cy­cles but ends up mostly for big­ger cars – ended merely 0.02 per cent, or $11, lower at $49,489.</p>
    <p>The com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle COE price was 2 per cent up at $35,900, while the mo­tor­cy­cle premium closed 2.4 per cent lower at $7,501.</p>
    <p>Mo­tor traders said the Christ­mas and New Year hol­i­day breaks meant fewer buy­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>Mr Ni­cholas Wong, gen­eral man­ager of Kah Mo­tor, said the tra­di­tional year-end rush by deal­ers to meet an­nual sales tar­gets is over, thus cool­ing bid­ding some­what.</p>
    <p>“It is a good breather,” Mr Wong said of the lat­est re­sults, point­ing out that prices had gone up by nearly $10,000 (for big­ger cars) in the last two rounds.</p>
    <p>“Most of those who were rush­ing to clear stock – which pushed up pre­mi­ums – have al­ready man­aged to do so,” he added.</p>
    <p>With the halt in the price spi­ral seen in the clos­ing weeks of last year, buy­ers may be en­cour­aged to come back to show­rooms, he said.</p>
    <p>Deal­ers are di­vided on the COE sup­ply out­look for this year. Some ex­pect a small in­crease in sup­ply on ac­count of about 22,000 cars which had their COEs reval­i­dated for five years in 2016. Five-year re­newals can­not be reval­i­dated fur­ther, and these cars will have to be scrapped this year.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, like Mr Wong, are brac­ing them­selves for a fur­ther dip. He ex­pects that the next three­month quota start­ing next month will shrink by around 6 per cent.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try watch­ers point out that there will be a del­uge of new car model launches this year, fol­low­ing the busi­ness sus­pen­sions brought on by pan­demic lock­downs last year.</p>
