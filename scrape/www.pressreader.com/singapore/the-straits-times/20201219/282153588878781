    <p>Founder of Web de­vel­op­ment firm Pur­ple­flakez</p>
    <p>Wear­able tech cou­pled with an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) plat­form by home-grown dig­i­tal ther­a­peu­tics start-up Bio­four­mis have helped mon­i­tor and man­age the con­di­tions of close to 100,000 Covid-19 pa­tients across four coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, through the use of arm­bands, over 20 phys­i­o­log­i­cal sig­nals of pa­tients in com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore are mon­i­tored round the clock, and pro­cessed with AI to pre­dict com­pli­ca­tions. This data helps doc­tors and nurses de­tect any sign of de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in a pa­tient’s con­di­tion and in­ter­vene quickly.</p>
    <p>Bio­four­mis was founded by Mr Kuldeep Singh Ra­jput, who quit his PhD stud­ies in 2015 to start the firm.</p>
    <p>The AI plat­form also en­ables per­son­alised care and disease pre­dic­tion for pa­tients with com­plex con­di­tions like heart failure and can­cer.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, SoftBank Vi­sion Fund led a US$100 mil­lion (S$133 mil­lion) in­vest­ment in the start-up.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Teck Hwee was 19 when he lost his fa­ther in 2010. De­spite fall­ing into de­pres­sion, he started a Web de­vel­op­ment busi­ness, Pur­ple­flakez, to gen­er­ate side in­come to sup­port his fam­ily and pay off their debts.</p>
    <p>It took a whole year be­fore he found his first client, and un­til then he had of­ten con­tem­plated throw­ing in the towel. But the Ngee Ann Polytech­nic grad­u­ate, who de­vel­oped a pas­sion for Web de­vel­op­ment in se­condary school, per­se­vered, and now heads a team of five.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which has served around 60 clients to date, has ex­panded to pro­vide small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises with nu­mer­ous IT cus­tomised ser­vices to sim­plify their busi­ness pro­cesses, such as con­tent cre­ation, server host­ing sup­port and Web so­lu­tion ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Pur­ple­flakez has also co-spon­sored a char­ity event, Sil­ver Screen­ing 2-For-1, an­nu­ally from 2017 to last year. The movie screen­ings, which brought to­gether vol­un­teers and more than 2,300 se­niors, were graced by film-maker Jack Neo.</p>
