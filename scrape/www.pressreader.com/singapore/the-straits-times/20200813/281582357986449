    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions should con­tinue to iden­tify Sin­ga­pore­ans with high po­ten­tial for lead­er­ship roles and ex­pand the sup­ply of tal­ented lo­cals, the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore said. The call comes af­ter the Min­istry of Man­power said that 47 em­ploy­ers were placed on the watch list for pos­si­ble dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Banks in Sin­ga­pore said they keep a strong lo­cal core in the work­force, while grow­ing the pipe­line of lo­cal tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Their re­sponses came as the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore urged fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to groom Sin­ga­porean lead­ers and grow the tal­ent pool here.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered said its staff lev­els here have grown from 8,000 to 10,000 in re­cent years, with Sin­ga­pore­ans form­ing 70 per cent of the head­count.</p>
    <p>“The bank has in­vested heav­ily in groom­ing Sin­ga­porean lead­ers – 70 per cent of its Sin­ga­pore man­age­ment team are Sin­ga­pore­ans,” it said in a state­ment. “The bank has many Sin­ga­pore core lead­ers across global and re­gional roles as well, and there are cur­rently 140 Sin­ga­pore­ans posted over­seas.”</p>
    <p>DBS Bank said that over 90 per cent of its 12,000-strong work­force here are Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs). It added that it is com­mit­ted “to de­vel­op­ing lo­cal em­ploy­ees across all lev­els, while en­sur­ing a strong com­ple­ment be­tween our lo­cal and for­eign tal­ent”.</p>
    <p>UBS said around 75 per cent of its work­force com­prises Sin­ga­pore­ans or PRs. It has close to 3,000 em­ploy­ees across var­i­ous di­vi­sions. A UBS spokesman said: “We be­lieve in the im­por­tance of long-term suc­ces­sion plan­ning and tal­ent de­vel­op­ment, which is why we have been nur­tur­ing the fu­ture pipe­line of fi­nan­cial lead­ers through our UBS Univer­sity as well as our lat­est UBS-Su­per pro­gramme.” The pro­gramme helps grad­u­ates and mid-ca­reer work­ers de­velop sus­tain­able skills for the fu­ture fi­nan­cial sec­tor.</p>
    <p>HSBC said more than 85 per cent of its em­ploy­ees are Sin­ga­pore­ans or PRs while al­most 75 per cent of its se­nior staff po­si­tions are held by Sin­ga­pore­ans or PRs. There are also 250 Sin­ga­pore­ans work­ing over­seas in se­nior po­si­tions within the bank.</p>
    <p>An HSBC spokesman said: “Our sup­port ex­tends to build­ing a strong Sin­ga­pore core and we have poli­cies and mea­sures to in­vest, de­velop, and pro­mote Sin­ga­porean tal­ent – both within Sin­ga­pore and abroad. As an in­ter­na­tional bank, HSBC also un­re­servedly sup­ports di­ver­sity and in­clu­sion as some­thing that re­flects our val­ues.”</p>
    <p>Lo­cals ac­count for 90 per cent of OCBC Group’s head­count here. Ms Jac­inta Low, its head of hu­man re­source plan­ning, said: “When we are look­ing to hire some­one for a role, we look for can­di­dates with the right skills and ex­pe­ri­ence which best fit the role. We also look out for whether the can­di­date em­bod­ies val­ues which align with our or­gan­i­sa­tion’s core val­ues.”</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank deputy chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive Wee Ee Cheong added that it has ad­justed hir­ing plans for the year, but does not plan on re­trench­ing due to the pan­demic.</p>
