    <p>Work from home be­came a must for most busi­nesses dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod that be­gan in April. The mea­sures are be­ing eased as Sin­ga­pore reopens in phases. How­ever, even as more em­ploy­ees can re­turn to the work­place, some em­ploy­ers con­tinue to al­low their staff to work from home and re­turn to the of­fice only when needed. That both bosses and work­ers should recog­nise the ben­e­fits of work­ing from home is an en­cour­ag­ing sign that the world of work is ad­just­ing it­self to the new nor­mal cre­ated by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. In­deed, ac­cord­ing to the re­sults of a sur­vey, eight out of 10 work­ers say that they pre­fer to work from home or have flex­i­ble work­ing ar­range­ments. Com­mis­sioned by The Straits Times, the sur­vey of nearly 1,800 peo­ple asked what work ar­range­ments they would pre­fer. Four in 10 wanted to split their time between the of­fice and their home, while slightly more than four in 10 said that they wanted to con­tinue work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>Wor­ry­ingly, about half the re­spon­dents felt that they would be pe­nalised by em­ploy­ers if they ex­pressed their pref­er­ence for work­ing from home. How­ever, that at­ti­tude could change as the ben­e­fits of hy­brid work­ing, or a ju­di­cious mix­ture of re­mote and of­fice work, look set to be one of the key fea­tures of the work­place af­ter Covid-19. Clearly, the prac­tice re­flects the de­sire for au­ton­omy, or con­trol over their time, that em­ploy­ees prize. Yet, it also en­sures that bosses can have suf­fi­cient con­trol of the daily work­flow so that cor­po­rate tar­gets are met by em­ploy­ees and ma­lin­ger­ers do not be­come a drag on gen­eral pro­duc­tiv­ity. Also, from a lo­gis­ti­cal point of view, hy­brid work re­duces the need for of­fice space, which is a key fi­nan­cial con­sid­er­a­tion in vi­brant city ar­eas where rents can be high. On the face of it, hy­brid work­ing presents a win-win so­lu­tion for com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are down­sides to that prospect. The ren­tal prop­erty mar­ket would suf­fer from a con­trac­tion of the need for of­fice space. Com­pa­nies that have in­vested in the pur­chase of premises would have to deal with sud­denly re­dun­dant of­fice space. Some firms might find them­selves han­dling what has been called a two-tiered work­force, one present in the of­fice at any time and the other at home. Then, again, some tasks such as writ­ing re­ports can be car­ried out eas­ily at home, but brain­storm­ing ses­sions that de­pend on face-to-face in­ter­ac­tion are suited more to the fa­mil­iar con­fines of a sin­gle of­fice space. Broadly, so­cial­is­ing among col­leagues can en­er­gise and catal­yse the hu­man el­e­ment in work­place com­mu­ni­ca­tion. It is dif­fi­cult to vi­su­alise that com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­ing repli­cated un­der a hy­brid ar­range­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the new nor­mal will re­quire ad­just­ments on all fronts. How to make hy­brid work work­able is a chal­lenge that Sin­ga­pore em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees should ex­plore as the coun­try eases its way into life af­ter Covid-19.</p>
