    <p>Mem­bers of the public at an open field yes­ter­day be­hind Wisma Gey­lang Serai, one of 11 heart­land lo­ca­tions that ush­ered in the new year with a fire­works dis­play. Com­mu­nity count­down pro­grammes also went vir­tual for the first time, with some in­clud­ing a live stream of the fire­works. Mean­while, cities around the world saw muted fes­tiv­i­ties. •</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Fire­works soared into the sky above the Syd­ney Opera House, but the har­bour be­low was a de­serted ghost town, a fit­tingly creepy send-off for a year that will not be missed.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing, no light show il­lu­mi­nated the city from the top of the TV tower. St Peter’s in Rome was al­most empty for ves­pers. Lon­don’s Trafal­gar Square, Moscow’s Red Square, Madrid’s Puerta del Sol and New York’s Times Square were all bar­ri­caded off.</p>
    <p>Good rid­dance, 2020. Hello, 2021. While some cities launched fire­works over empty streets, oth­ers, such as Lon­don and Sin­ga­pore, called off their dis­plays.</p>
    <p>Paris, Rome and Is­tan­bul were un­der cur­few.</p>
    <p>New York’s count­down ball dropped on Broad­way as sched­uled. But in place of thou­sands of peo­ple jammed shoul­der to shoul­der in Times Square, the au­di­ence com­prised a few dozen pre-se­lected key work­ers – in­clud­ing nurses, doc­tors, a gro­cery store worker and a pizza de­liv­ery man – their fam­i­lies kept 2m apart in so­cially dis­tanced pens.</p>
    <p>“It’s go­ing to be ac­tu­ally, ar­guably, the most spe­cial, the most poignant, the most mov­ing New Year’s Eve,” Mayor Bill de Bla­sio, who pushed the but­ton to start the crys­tal ball’s de­scent, told re­porters. “In 2021, we’re go­ing to show peo­ple what it looks like to re­cover, to come back.”</p>
    <p>With more than 1.8 mil­lion peo­ple dead and 83 mil­lion in­fected around the globe since last New Year’s Eve – yet hope emerg­ing that new vac­cines can help tame the pan­demic – the year ended un­like any other in mem­ory.</p>
    <p>THE PARTY GOES ON</p>
    <p>In the Chi­nese city of Wuhan,</p>
    <p>where the pan­demic orig­i­nated a year ago, large crowds took to the streets, in­clud­ing hun­dreds who gath­ered in front of the old Hankow Cus­toms House build­ing. When its old clock struck mid­night, many of them cheered and re­leased bal­loons into the air.</p>
    <p>“I’m so, so, so in­cred­i­bly happy,” said 20-year-old stu­dent and tourist Yang Wenx­uan. “I hope that (in 2021) I can ob­tain my bachelor’s de­gree and I hope I can find a boyfriend.”</p>
    <p>There was a heavy police pres­ence and strict crowd con­trol, but the count­down ap­peared to pro­ceed in a re­laxed at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>Many cities in Tai­wan can­celled public at­ten­dance at events like fire­works dis­plays, and had asked peo­ple to watch them on­line or on tele­vi­sion. But the Taipei city govern­ment al­lowed in-per­son at­ten­dance at its New Year’s events, as well as broad­cast­ing them live – in­clud­ing fire­works set off from the out­side of Taipei 101, once the world’s tallest build­ing.</p>
    <p>The virus also did not stop North</p>
    <p>Korea from stag­ing its celebratio­n in Py­ongyang. State me­dia showed rev­ellers in face masks fill­ing the main square for a con­cert and fire­works.</p>
    <p>But in Madrid’s Puerta del Sol, where Spa­niards typ­i­cally count down to mid­night by stuff­ing grapes into their mouths at each clock strike, police put up bar­ri­ers to keep peo­ple out.</p>
    <p>Mr Jose An­gel Balsa, a 61-year-old re­tiree, said he would spend the evening “with fam­ily, just the four of us at home, hold­ing lots of video calls and hop­ing for this (pan­demic) to end as soon as pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>Berlin rev­ellers usu­ally take to the streets to light up the sky with fire­works on New Year’s Eve, but the au­thor­i­ties banned the use of fire­works in cer­tain public places, in­clud­ing more than 50 zones in the cap­i­tal, to dis­cour­age large crowds from gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Some Ber­lin­ers in­stead tried to launch fire­works from their homes, lead­ing to dozens of fires across the Ger­man cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>At A la Ville de Rodez, an up­mar</p>
    <p>POIGNANT MO­MENT</p>
    <p>It’s go­ing to be ac­tu­ally, ar­guably, the most spe­cial, the most poignant, the most mov­ing New Year’s Eve... In 2021, we’re go­ing to show peo­ple what it looks like to re­cover, to come back.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK MAYOR BILL DE BLA­SIO, who pushed the but­ton to start the crys­tal ball’s de­scent in Times Square.</p>
    <p>ket del­i­catessen in Paris, man­ager Brice Tapon sent cus­tomers home with pack­ages of foie gras, truf­fles and pate for groups of two or three.</p>
    <p>Rules for­bid more than six adults to gather around the din­ner ta­ble.</p>
    <p>One cus­tomer, Ms Anne Chap­lin, said she would “stuff my­self with foie gras, cham­pagne and all this food”.</p>
    <p>“And I’ll stay home.”</p>
