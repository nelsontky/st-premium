    <p>Last week, Work­ers’ Party MP Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) posted on her In­sta­gram ac­count a pic­ture of her­self shar­ing a meal with sev­eral of her party mem­bers, with key land­marks of down­town Sin­ga­pore clearly vis­i­ble in the back­ground.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, who is WP chair­man, had at­tended the open­ing of the 14th Par­lia­ment with for­mer WP chief Low Thia Khi­ang, for­mer Hougang MP Png Eng Huat, and MP Den­nis Tan (Hougang), be­fore dining in the open at a rooftop bar near City Hall. “Wow, what a sky­line,” she wrote. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong cited the pic­ture and her com­ments in his speech in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, not­ing that be­hind the group one could see the Na­tional Gallery, Raf­fles Place and part of the new down­town in Ma­rina South, “brightly lit and spec­tac­u­lar”.</p>
    <p>“In the cap­tion, Ms Lim wrote: ‘What a sky­line’,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>“I thought to my­self: She’s paid an enor­mous trib­ute to the PAP Gov­ern­ment and to the peo­ple of Sin­ga­pore – my pre­de­ces­sors as well as my col­leagues in the cur­rent Gov­ern­ment – and gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans who worked with the PAP Gov­ern­ment to make this hap­pen,” the Prime Minister added.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think she in­tended it, and there­fore I ap­pre­ci­ated it all the more. Together we did make this hap­pen,” he said.</p>
    <p>PM Lee had, in his speech, noted that the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party built Sin­ga­pore with the peo­ple. It had also put enor­mous em­pha­sis on the qual­ity of gov­ern­ment – the pub­lic ser­vice as well as the po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship – he added, say­ing it had gone to great lengths to re­cruit the best peo­ple to en­ter pol­i­tics, join the Gov­ern­ment, and serve Sin­ga­pore.</p>

        <p data-role="text">A pic&#xAD;ture posted last week by Work&#xAD;ers&#x2019; Party MP Sylvia Lim (sec&#xAD;ond from right) of her hav&#xAD;ing din&#xAD;ner with party col&#xAD;leagues at a rooftop bar near City Hall. She had writ&#xAD;ten: &#x201C;Wow, what a sky&#xAD;line.&#x201D; With Ms Lim are (from left) Hougang MP Den&#xAD;nis Tan, for&#xAD;mer WP chief Low Thia Khi&#xAD;ang, Mr Tan&#x2019;s wife Hui Ts&#xAD;ing, Ms Lim&#x2019;s part&#xAD;ner Quah Kim Song and for&#xAD;mer Hougang MP Png Eng Huat. A ne&#xAD;ti&#xAD;zen on Face&#xAD;book asked her why there were six peo&#xAD;ple in the pic&#xAD;ture, to which Ms Lim replied that it was only mo&#xAD;men&#xAD;tary. The coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus re&#xAD;stric&#xAD;tions cap the num&#xAD;ber of peo&#xAD;ple at gather&#xAD;ings to five.</p>
