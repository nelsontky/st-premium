    <p>De­but nov­el­ists dom­i­nated the short­list of this year’s Booker Prize, one of the world’s most pres­ti­gious lit­er­ary awards, the judges an­nounced on Tues­day, while star au­thors such as Hi­lary Man­tel and Anne Tyler did not make the list. Four of the six short­listed books are from first-time writ­ers, and four of the short­listed books are by women. The win­ning ti­tle will be un­veiled at a cer­e­mony in London on Nov 17.</p>
    <p>LONDON • De­but nov­el­ists dom­i­nated the short­list of this year’s Booker Prize, one of the world’s most pres­ti­gious lit­er­ary awards, the judges an­nounced on Tues­day, while star au­thors like Hi­lary Man­tel and Anne Tyler did not make the list.</p>
    <p>Four of the six short­listed books are from first-time writ­ers, three of whom are Amer­i­can, while the fourth holds dual Scot­tish and Amer­i­can na­tion­al­ity. Four of the short­listed books are by women.</p>
    <p>The nom­i­nated de­buts in­clude Dou­glas Stu­art’s Shug­gie Bain, a vi­o­lent tale of a child grow­ing up in 1980s Scot­land; and Bran­don Tay­lor’s Real Life, about a black gay grad­u­ate stu­dent nav­i­gat­ing cam­pus life.</p>
    <p>Diane Cook’s The New Wilder­ness, set in a dystopian fu­ture in which al­most all of the nat­u­ral world has been de­stroyed; and Avni Doshi’s Burnt Sugar, about an artist’s strug­gles to cope with her age­ing mother, are the other two de­buts on the list.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of de­buts “was a sur­prise”, said Sameer Rahim, an au­thor and one of the judges, in a news con­fer­ence in London an­nounc­ing the short­list. But he said it was “a red her­ring” to fo­cus on that is­sue be­cause lots of the au­thors had pre­vi­ous writ­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The judges also read the ma­jor­ity of the sub­mit­ted books on PDFs, few of which con­tained bi­o­graph­i­cal in­for­ma­tion, Rahim added, so they did not know which were by de­but nov­el­ists.</p>
    <p>“You don’t have time to Google the au­thors,” he said.</p>
    <p>In pre­vi­ous years, the Booker short­list has been dom­i­nated by lit­er­ary heavy­weights, with works by Mar­garet At­wood, Sal­man Rushdie and Elif Shafak all on last year’s list.</p>
    <p>In 2018, a group of high-pro­file au­thors de­manded – un­suc­cess­fully – that the Man Booker Foun­da­tion bar Amer­i­can au­thors from be­ing el­i­gi­ble.</p>
    <p>This year’s longlist, re­vealed in July, in­cluded Man­tel’s The Mir­ror And The Light, the con­clu­sion to her ac­claimed tril­ogy about Thomas Cromwell; and Tyler’s Red­head By The Side Of The Road. Nei­ther book made the cut.</p>
    <p>“As good as it was, there were six that were bet­ter,” said de­tec­tive nov­el­ist Lee Child, one of the judges, when asked about Man­tel’s omis­sion in the news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Man­tel won the Booker Prize for the first two parts of her Cromwell tril­ogy – in 2009 for Wolf Hall and in 2012 for Bring Up The Bod­ies.</p>
    <p>The Booker Prize, given to the best work of English-lan­guage fic­tion pub­lished in Bri­tain and Ire­land, has l aunched ca­reers and caused count­less ar­gu­ments since its cre­ation in 1969. Past lau­re­ates have ranged from con­tem­po­rary giants such as Ian McEwan and Ju­lian Barnes to Kazuo Ishig­uro and Roddy Doyle.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion tore up the rule book last year by split­ting the fic­tion award be­tween Canada’s Mar­garet At­wood and An­glo-Nige­rian au­thor Bernar­dine Evaristo.</p>
    <p>It has al­ready courted con­tro­versy this year by pit­ting nine Amer­i­cans or dual-United States cit­i­zens against just three Bri­tons, and now for over­look­ing Man­tel’s The Mir­ror And The Light.</p>
    <p>This year, two of the books on the short­list are by es­tab­lished au­thors – Maaza Mengiste’s The Shadow King and Tsitsi Dan­garem­bga’s This Mourn­able Body – and both works have re­ceived ac­claim.</p>
    <p>Writer Namwali Ser­pell, in a re­view for The New York Times, called Mengiste’s book about Ethiopian women in the sec­ond</p>
    <p>Italo-Ethiopian War a “lyri­cal, re­mark­able new novel”.</p>
    <p>This Mourn­able Body, about a woman strug­gling to find em­ploy­ment in Zim­babwe, has been equally praised.</p>
    <p>Au­thor Alexan­dra Fuller, writ­ing in The New York Times, called it “a masterpiec­e” look­ing at how women try “to imag­ine and work their way out of a nar­ra­tive that has al­ready been de­cided for them”.</p>
    <p>Dan­garem­bga is per­haps the best known name on the list be­cause of her po­lit­i­cal strug­gles. In July, she was ar­rested in Zim­babwe for tak­ing part in anti-cor­rup­tion protests.</p>
    <p>The short­list was cho­sen from a longlist of 13 books. Orig­i­nally, 162 books were sub­mit­ted for the prize. They were read by five judges, in­clud­ing Child and Lemn Sis­say, a Bri­tish poet.</p>
    <p>The win­ning ti­tle will be un­veiled at a cer­e­mony in London on Nov 17. Its au­thor will re­ceive £50,000 (S$87,700).</p>
