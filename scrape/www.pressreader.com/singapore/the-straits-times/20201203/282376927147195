    <p>First i mpres­sions usu­ally fade from memory but in the case of tan­dem para-cy­clist Steve Tee and his pi­lot Ang Kee Meng, their first meet­ing re­mains a mem­o­rable and hu­mor­ous one.</p>
    <p>“Can I feel your legs?” was one of the ini­tial ques­tions Tee, who is visu­ally im­paired, posed to a sur­prised Ang in May 2017.</p>
    <p>Re­count­ing that en­counter, Tee, 39, chuck­les and told The Straits Times: “My for­mer coach (Chris­tian Stauf­fer) told me not to worry be­cause Kee Meng is a big and strong guy with big legs so he will take care of me.</p>
    <p>“When we met, I was cu­ri­ous so I asked if I could touch his leg. I think he was a bit shocked. When I felt his leg, I was also a bit shocked, so we were both shocked in dif­fer­ent ways. Af­ter that and af­ter rid­ing with him, I felt like I could trust him and we can race to­gether. He’s like a men­tor to me and he has lots of ex­pe­ri­ence in cy­cling. He will share tips on how to im­prove my weak­nesses.”</p>
    <p>In tan­dem para-cy­cling, a visu­ally-im­paired ath­lete, called the stoker, is paired with a sighted coun­ter­part, or the pi­lot.</p>
    <p>Ang, 34, is a for­mer na­tional track cy­clist. He said: “When I first met Steve, he was very quiet and shy. Sub­se­quently, I tried to break the ice and he started telling me his sto­ries. He’s like a funny older broth­erso it’s quite fun to go out and ride with him.”</p>
    <p>A friend­ship and suc­cess­ful part­ner­ship has since blos­somed – they claimed a bronze in the 24.6km in­di­vid­ual time trial at the 2017 Asean Para Games in Kuala Lumpur and last year fin­ished third in the 4,000m in­di­vid­ual pur­suit (B) at the 9th Para Asian Track Cham­pi­onships in South Korea – with the pair set to rep­re­sent Sin­ga­pore at next year’s Tokyo Par­a­lympics.</p>
    <p>They will be an­nounced to­day as the first lo­cal ath­lete am­bas­sadors for tyre maker Bridge­stone, which has do­nated more than $160,000 to­wards their equip­ment, train­ing and com­pe­ti­tion costs.</p>
    <p>Paul Choo, Bridge­stone Asia Pa­cific’s vice-pres­i­dent of hu­man re­sources and cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity, said: “Their un­wa­ver­ing com­mit­ment and pos­i­tive at­ti­tude are an in­spi­ra­tion to us all as we nav­i­gate these dif­fi­cult times. We are very proud to be part of their re­mark­able jour­ney.”</p>
    <p>Other na­tional para-ath­letes pre­vi­ously sup­ported by cor­po­rate part­ners in­clude para-swim­mers Yip Pin Xiu (Citi Sin­ga­pore) and Toh Wei Soong (BP Sin­ga­pore and Toy­ota Mo­tor Asia Pa­cific) as well as para-archer Nur Syahi­dah Alim (BP Sin­ga­pore). BP had also sup­ported three-gold Par­a­lympic cham­pion Yip and Par­a­lympic bronze medal­list Theresa Goh for the 2016 Rio Par­a­lympics.</p>
    <p>In June, Tee left his job as a su­per­vi­sor at a call cen­tre to train full­time. He trains 18 to 23 hours a week, while Ang trains more than 25 hours. They usu­ally go for two or three train­ing camps over­seas a year for one to two months each time and are plan­ning one in Perth next year.</p>
    <p>In 2004, Tee was di­ag­nosed with re­tini­tis pig­men­tosa which his doc­tors said would lead to to­tal or near-to­tal blind­ness. When he first heard the news, he was dev­as­tated and shocked as he could no longer par­tic­i­pate in his favourite sports like foot­ball and cy­cling.</p>
    <p>“I went into a state of iso­la­tion for about three weeks,” he re­counted.</p>
    <p>The turn­ing point came when one day, he was awak­ened by the sound of thun­der and re­alised that he was very hun­gry as he had not eaten the whole day.</p>
    <p>As there was no one and no food at home, Tee grabbed an um­brella and bought him­self a packet of chicken rice from a stall that was a 10-minute walk from his home. “I re­alised if you’re hun­gry, you will find a way to pro­tect your­self from the storm and get food,” he said. “Like­wise, if you’re hun­gry, you can over­come any kind of ad­ver­sity or chal­lenges you face in life.”</p>
    <p>By end-2008, he grad­u­ated with a dou­ble major de­gree in com­puter se­cu­rity and net­work­ing and eight months later, landed his first job in a call cen­tre.</p>
    <p>In 2015, he cap­tained Sin­ga­pore’s five-a-side visu­ally im­paired foot­ball team at the Asean Para Games on home soil, be­fore switch­ing to tan­dem cy­cling in 2017.</p>
    <p>At the Par­a­lympics next year, Tee and Ang hope to im­prove their per­sonal best of 4min 47.414sec in the 4,000m event set last Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Ang added: “Hope­fully, we’ll be able to in­spire other younger peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and get them out to the light.</p>
    <p>“It’s about telling peo­ple that if Steve can do it, I’m pretty sure any­one who has a will can do it as well.”</p>
