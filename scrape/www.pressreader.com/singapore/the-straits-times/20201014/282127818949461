    <p>With eight years’ ex­pe­ri­ence un­der her belt, Mrs Lyn Ling thought she had seen ev­ery­thing in the debt col­lec­tion busi­ness.</p>
    <p>But that was un­til Sept 17, when she and a col­league found them­selves in the har­row­ing sit­u­a­tion of des­per­ately hold­ing on to a fe­male debtor who was try­ing to jump from a 13th-storey ledge.</p>
    <p>“We went to her flat to serve her no­tice and talk to her as she had stopped pay­ing her ren­o­va­tion loan,” said Mrs Ling, 35, founder of Fast Debt Re­cov­ery Spe­cial­ist.</p>
    <p>“Sud­denly, she shouted at us, un­locked the gate and rushed to­wards the ledge out­side her unit.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore dash­ing out of the flat, the woman had said in Man­darin: “I can let you see my two bank ac­counts, the to­tal is zero. I jump down now for you to see.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Ling’s col­league Gary Tan, 39, said: “She may have been small in size but she was strong and strug­gling vi­o­lently.”</p>
    <p>As the scream­ing woman raised one leg onto the rail­ing, Mr Tan pulled her away by the shoul­ders while Mrs Ling gripped her legs.</p>
    <p>For the next few min­utes, the pair held on tightly to her.</p>
    <p>The woman even­tu­ally re­gained her com­po­sure and Mrs Ling called the po­lice for help.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ling said the woman had lost her job and her hus­band was bank­rupt. But the woman’s prob­lems were not caused solely by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Two of three debt re­cov­ery com­pa­nies The Straits Times spoke to said their busi­ness has risen since April, when the two-month cir­cuit breaker to stem the spread of Covid-19 was im­posed.</p>
    <p>Debt re­cov­ery agents are hired when debtors go miss­ing or ig­nore tele­phone calls by fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions. These agents are legally al­lowed to pur­sue debtors on be­half of cred­i­tors, in con­trast with loan sharks.</p>
    <p>Ms Yvonne Ho, gen­eral man­ager of Sin­ga­pore Debt Col­lec­tion Ser­vice (SDCS), said the num­ber of cases that the com­pany han­dles has in­creased by 30 per cent a month since April. These cases in­clude debtors de­fault­ing on their obli­ga­tions, such as per­sonal and car loans, and rene­go­ti­at­ing to pay smaller in­stal­ments.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, there has been a rise in the num­ber of debtors who re­fused or were un­able to re­pay loans rang­ing from $2,000 to $300,000.</p>
    <p>“We have seen a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of peo­ple who were re­trenched or saw a drop in their in­comes due to the Covid-19 out­break,” said Ms Ho, 29. “Some busi­ness own­ers have also been un­able to pay rent due to the eco­nomic down­turn.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 out­break, SDCS han­dled be­tween 50 and 100 cases a month on be­half of car leas­ing, con­struc­tion and ren­o­va­tion com­pa­nies. Re­cently, the fig­ure has ex­ceeded the monthly av­er­age.</p>
    <p>But JMS Rogers, another debt col­lec­tion firm, said the num­ber of cases it han­dles has dropped from about 70 a month to fewer than 10.</p>
    <p>Mr Roger Ra­jan, 49, owner of the firm, at­trib­uted the drop to bank­rupt com­pa­nies de­clin­ing to pur­sue debtors as they do not wish to in­cur costs.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ling says that while she has a job to do, she strives to help both the client and the debtor.</p>
    <p>A win-win sit­u­a­tion in these chal­leng­ing times is to re­cover some pay­ment for the client from the debtor.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ling said she is able to help a debtor only if he co­op­er­ates.</p>
    <p>“We are con­cerned about the debtor’s fi­nan­cial sta­tus and want to know how we can help,” she said.</p>
    <p>“There are op­tions for debtors to ap­ply for gov­ern­ment grants and sub­si­dies, and we can ad­vise them on the doc­u­ments they need.”</p>
    <p>In the case of the fe­male debtor, the woman has been given a de­fer­ment up to next Jan­uary, when she is ex­pected to be­gin re­pay­ing her loan.</p>
