    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob yes­ter­day con­ferred the 2020 Pres­i­dent’s Guide Award on five Girl Guides, and Pres­i­dent’s Scout Award on 21 Ven­ture Scouts.</p>
    <p>The award cer­e­mony was held at the Is­tana.</p>
    <p>These awards are the high­est honours be­stowed on Sin­ga­pore’s out­stand­ing Girl Guides and Ven­ture Scouts, in recog­ni­tion of their all-round per­for­mance, ser­vice to the com­mu­nity and ded­i­ca­tion to their re­spec­tive move­ments.</p>
    <p>This year, the win­ners demon­strated ex­tra­or­di­nary lead­er­ship and left an im­pact on the com­mu­nity amid the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Janel Ng Jia Yu, 16, com­pany leader of Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Girls’ School Girl Guides, was among the win­ners. Her ac­com­plish­ments in­clude 20 hours of ser­vice by vol­un­teer­ing at Will­ing Hearts and Lions Be­frien­ders. She par­tic­i­pated in the pack­ing and dis­tri­bu­tion of food items to the needy and hosted ac­tiv­i­ties for the el­derly.</p>
    <p>“I hope to in­spire younger Guides. I wanted to show them that if they aim high enough, they can achieve any­thing,” said Janel.</p>
    <p>An­other win­ner, Abby Yap Qi Qi, 20, felt re­lieved that her years of ser­vice to Ven­ture Scouts had been recog­nised at such a level. The stu­dent at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Man­age­ment is pas­sion­ate about help­ing the el­derly have mean­ing­ful day-to-day ex­pe­ri­ences and sup­port­ing the less well-off. She led a group of vol­un­teers to carry out ac­tiv­i­ties like spring clean­ing and in­ter­act­ing with the el­derly at St John’s Home for El­derly Per­sons.</p>
    <p>Si­auw Yu Chuan, 18, from the Catholic High Scout Group, re­counted his ex­pe­ri­ence of the Pi­o­neer Ex­plo­ration Hike he com­pleted in April last year. The 70km hike took place in Sin­ga­pore and lasted two days. He ex­pe­ri­enced cramps at the 20km mark, but was able to press on with con­stant sup­port and mo­ti­va­tion from his hik­ing com­pan­ion. He learnt the im­por­tance of grat­i­tude and per­se­ver­ance through this jour­ney.</p>
    <p>The three win­ners plan to con­tinue con­tribut­ing to their ju­niors and run projects that will im­prove the com­mu­nity.</p>
