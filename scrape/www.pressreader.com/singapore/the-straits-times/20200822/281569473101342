    <p>Amer­i­can con­tem­po­rary artist Brian Don­nelly, also known as Kaws, col­lab­o­rated with long-time cre­ative stu­dio Al­lRight­sRe­served in Hong Kong to cel­e­brate the 20th an­niver­sary of his Com­pan­ion char­ac­ter. Kaws: Hol­i­day Space in­volved send­ing a Com­pan­ion sculp­ture (be­low) into the strato­sphere for a zero-grav­ity walk be­fore gen­tly coax­ing it back to earth us­ing a parachute.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can con­tem­po­rary artist Brian Don­nelly, also known as Kaws, whose works have fetched mil­lions at art auc­tions, col­lab­o­rated with long-time cre­ative stu­dio Al­lRight­sRe­served (ARR) in Hong Kong to cel­e­brate the 20th an­niver­sary of his Com­pan­ion char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>Com­pan­ion – which sports XXs in place of eyes, large gloved hands and big shoes – is in­spired by Dis­ney’s Mickey Mouse and is one of Kaws’ sig­na­ture creations.</p>
    <p>The 46-year-old artist has ex­hib­ited Com­pan­ion in Seoul, Taipei, Hong Kong and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>His lat­est stop: Space.</p>
    <p>The team from ARR used a high-al­ti­tude bal­loon to pro­pel the metal­lic sculp­ture of Com­pan­ion 41km into the strato­sphere for a two-hour, zero-grav­ity walk be­fore gen­tly coax­ing it back to earth us­ing a parachute.</p>
    <p>Kaws: Hol­i­day Space was video­taped l ast month, but l aunched only on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways been i nspired by space,” the artist tells The Straits Times in an e-mail in­ter­view. “The fas­ci­na­tion of the un­known and the thought of pos­si­bly go­ing (up) one day.”</p>
    <p>In all, the jour­ney – from prepa­ra­tion to land­ing – took about eight hours and was recorded with a 360-de­gree panoramic video cam­era.</p>
    <p>To com­mem­o­rate the space ex­plo­ration, three 30cm-tall Kaws: Hol­i­day Space Com­pan­ion col­lectibles in gold, sil­ver and black were launched on ARR’s DDT on­line store on Tues­day. They were sold out im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Don­nelly says he is con­stantly think­ing about what sculp­ture can mean for peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Covid-19, for in­stance, has made the artist, who works from his stu­dio in Brook­lyn, New York, want to tran­scend the phys­i­cal lim­i­ta­tions and chal­lenges brought on by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause this year marks 20 years since I cre­ated Com­pan­ion, I tried to find a way around all the re­stric­tions and do some­thing special,” says Don­nelly, whose art­works have been col­lected by ac­tors such as Henry Gold­ing, the Malaysian-Bri­tish star of Crazy Rich Asians (2018), and mu­si­cians such as Amer­i­can singer­song­writer Phar­rell Wil­liams.</p>
    <p>“I felt so con­fined the past few months that cre­at­ing a project like this has re­ally given me a chance to es­cape,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Don­nelly was dubbed the “mar­ket phe­nom­e­non of the mo­ment” by The New York Times in Oc­to­ber last year dur­ing the Frieze Lon­don and Frieze Mas­ters art fairs in Re­gent’s Park in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional art gallery Skarst­edt, which deals in works by con­tem­po­rary artists such as Keith Har­ing, Robert Map­plethorpe and Pablo Pi­casso, showed 10 new acrylic ab­stracts by Kaws, as well as two large resin sculp­tures.</p>
    <p>All the works were snapped up by buy­ers, the gallery said.</p>
    <p>His paint­ings were priced be­tween US$450,000 (S$615,000) and US$575,000, while the sculp­tures had tags of US$850,000 each.</p>
    <p>Don­nelly started dab­bling in street graf­fiti around 1996, paint­ing skulls and XX eyes – his sig­na­ture mo­tif – on ad­ver­tis­ing light boxes, tele­phone booths and bus stops on the streets of Man­hat­tan.</p>
    <p>To­day, his works in­clude largescale sculp­tures, paint­ings, street art and mer­chan­dise de­sign that are ex­hib­ited and sold in museums and art gal­leries around the world.</p>
    <p>“I find in­spi­ra­tion un­avoid­able,” says the artist. “Both good and bad in­ter­ac­tions can send me think­ing in a di­rec­tion that might have noth­ing to do with the orig­i­nal mo­ment, but some­how find its way into the art I make.”</p>
