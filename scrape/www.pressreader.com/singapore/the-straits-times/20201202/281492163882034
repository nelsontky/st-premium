    <p>What is your se­cret to look­ing fab­u­lous?</p>
    <p>Hav­ing an at­ti­tude of grat­i­tude, good sleep, drink­ing enough water, ex­er­cis­ing and smil­ing.</p>
    <p>Has there ever been a time when you were not fit and fab?</p>
    <p>Yes, when I was in my early 30s.</p>
    <p>I ran a lot and did not have the ap­petite to eat. I ended up los­ing a lot of weight and was too skinny.</p>
    <p>What is your diet like?</p>
    <p>I am a ve­gan. I eat whole foods such as fruit, veg­eta­bles, whole grains, nuts and seeds. I con­sume brown rice, po­ta­toes and corn.</p>
    <p>What are your in­dul­gences? Pizza, dark choco­late, ve­gan ice cream and brown­ies.</p>
    <p>How do you main­tain a healthy work-life bal­ance?</p>
    <p>I think it’s im­por­tant to ac­cept that there is no per­fect work-life bal­ance. Pri­ori­tis­ing my time, set­ting work hours, stick­ing to them and al­lo­cat­ing time to ex­er­cise are im­por­tant to main­tain­ing a healthy work-life bal­ance.</p>
    <p>What are the three most im­por­tant things in your life?</p>
    <p>Men­tal health, fam­ily and friends, and pur­pose and pas­sion.</p>
    <p>What’s your favourite and least favourite part of your body?</p>
    <p>I don’t have a favourite or least favourite. I train hard to achieve the physique I have to­day.</p>
    <p>What I love most is that my body is my own, I love that it’s dif­fer­ent from any­one else’s and it al­lows me to do so many things I love.</p>
    <p>What are your must-dos be­fore and af­ter a work­out?</p>
    <p>A pre-work­out meal is very im­por­tant. I have to fuel my body to have the en­ergy for the whole train­ing. I also do a proper warm-up be­fore start­ing my work­out.</p>
    <p>Af­ter train­ing, a must-have drink is a plant-based pro­tein smoothie with greens to help strengthen the mus­cle fi­bres, and re­fuel and re­pair the mus­cles. A good 10 min­utes of stretch­ing af­ter the work­out is a must.</p>
    <p>How im­por­tant is it for you to keep up with your fit­ness rou­tine?</p>
    <p>It is very im­por­tant. There are days when I don’t feel like train­ing but I train any­way. It helps me feel good and revs up my en­ergy lev­els and helps im­prove my mood.</p>
    <p>How are you keep­ing fit dur­ing this pe­riod?</p>
    <p>Hav­ing enough rest, main­tain­ing a bal­anced diet and ex­er­cis­ing have been part of my life­style even be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>What are the changes you have made to keep ex­er­cis­ing dur­ing this time?</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker when all gyms were closed, I trained at home. I con­verted one of the rooms to a mini dojo (a room where mar­tial arts is prac­tised) where I spent most of my days train­ing on my own or with friends via video-con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom and teach­ing kids on­line.</p>
    <p>I in­vested in re­sis­tance bands to add to my weights equip­ment and I couldn’t be hap­pier with the re­sults.</p>
    <p>How has your ac­tive life­style in­flu­enced your fam­ily and friends?</p>
    <p>My friends have said I have mo­ti­vated them to stay pos­i­tive, given them ideas on how to stay fit, for ex­am­ple, dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, and re­minded them that fit­ness is about mak­ing grad­ual im­prove­ment and not com­par­isons.</p>
    <p>What’s the most ex­treme thing you have done in the name of fit­ness?</p>
    <p>At­tend­ing train­ing camps, but I would not call it ex­treme as it ben­e­fits and com­ple­ments my learn­ing, un­der­stand­ing and knowl­edge about kali.</p>
    <p>How ex­ten­sive is your col­lec­tion of sports-re­lated para­pher­na­lia?</p>
    <p>It is mod­er­ate. I have box­ing gloves, mixed mar­tial arts gloves and weapons I use for kali.</p>
    <p>Would you go for plas­tic surgery?</p>
    <p>No. For me it’s just not some­thing I would ever se­ri­ously con­sider. I re­spect those who choose to un­dergo it. If you feel that plas­tic surgery would in­crease your con­fi­dence or the qual­ity of your life, then go for it.</p>
    <p>Do you think you’re sexy?</p>
    <p>Hell, yeah! Know­ing what I am pas­sion­ate about and be­ing able to share my pas­sion with­out forc­ing it upon peo­ple; shar­ing it as joy and ex­cite­ment is a very sexy thing.</p>
