    <p>BEI­JING • A fresh coro­n­avirus clus­ter in a port city in north-east China has spread to other prov­inces and prompted new re­stric­tions, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day, as Bei­jing scram­bles to pre­vent a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>China had largely brought the virus un­der con­trol – since it was first de­tected in the coun­try late last year – through a se­ries of strict lock­downs and travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>But in re­cent months, small out­breaks have given cause for con­cern, with China re­port­ing 68 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day – the high­est daily num­ber since April.</p>
    <p>Of those, 57 were in the north­west­ern re­gion of Xin­jiang, where an out­break has re­sulted in mil­lions of res­i­dents be­ing tested as well as strict lock­downs in the re­gional cap­i­tal Urumqi.</p>
    <p>That brings the to­tal num­ber of cases in the re­gion’s cur­rent out­break to 235 since the first in­fec­tion was re­ported on July 16.</p>
    <p>Xin­jiang has yet to ex­plain how pa­tient zero, a 24-year-old woman who worked in a mall in its cap­i­tal Urumqi, con­tracted the virus.</p>
    <p>Six more cases were also re­ported in the in­dus­trial port city of Dalian, Liaon­ing prov­ince, where a new out­break first emerged at a seafood pro­cess­ing plant last week. This brings the to­tal num­ber of new in­fec­tions in Dalian to 44.</p>
    <p>To con­tain the spread of the virus, Xin­jiang and Dalian have tested mil­lions of peo­ple for Covid-19, but the coro­n­avirus is al­ready on the move.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties said the Dalian clus­ter has now spread to nine cities in five re­gions across the coun­try, in­clud­ing as far away as the south-eastern coastal prov­ince of Fu­jian.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in Fu­jian have said the pro­vin­cial cap­i­tal Fuzhou would en­ter “wartime mode” af­ter it dis­cov­ered an asymp­to­matic pa­tient who had trav­elled from Dalian, 1,500km away.</p>
    <p>The new mea­sures mean i ncreased scru­tiny of trav­ellers who en­ter the city from na­tion­wide virus hot spots.</p>
    <p>A fresh Bei­jing case re­ported yes­ter­day was also linked to an asymp­to­matic pa­tient who had trav­elled from Dalian – the first new lo­cal case since a clus­ter in the cap­i­tal was brought un­der con­trol early this month.</p>
    <p>Twelve new asymp­to­matic cases were also recorded in Dalian yes­ter­day. China counts asymp­to­matic cases sep­a­rately.</p>
    <p>Foot­ball matches in the Chi­nese Su­per League are cur­rently be­ing played in the city un­der strict con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The Dalian au­thor­i­ties have banned group cel­e­bra­tory din­ing ac­tiv­i­ties and or­dered cus­tomers to dis­play a lo­cal “health code” when en­ter­ing restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Across the coun­try, 391 peo­ple are still hos­pi­talised with Covid-19. There have been 83,959 in­fec­tions in main­land China in to­tal.</p>
