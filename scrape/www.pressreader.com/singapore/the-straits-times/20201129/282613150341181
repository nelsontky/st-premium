    <p>There are gen­er­ally three types of un­happy peo­ple at work, says life coach Eu­gene Seah.</p>
    <p>You have the ones who are tem­po­rar­ily un­happy due to is­sues with, say, their col­leagues or boss; those who are deeply un­happy be­cause they would rather leave their job and do some­thing more mean­ing­ful; and fi­nally those un­happy souls who are just walk­ing in cir­cles, un­sure of what they want.</p>
    <p>If any of those de­scribes you, you are not alone.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey re­port by data col­lec­tion plat­form Qualtrics that was re­leased in Jan­uary last year said just 49 per cent of Sin­ga­pore re­spon­dents were sat­is­fied with their cur­rent job, be­low the re­ported global av­er­age of 62 per cent of em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Coaches and psy­chol­o­gists agree that hap­pi­ness at work is im­por­tant since peo­ple spend so much time there.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of psy­chol­ogy Wil­liam Tov notes that while it may not be nec­es­sary to be “cheer­ful” at work, it is im­por­tant for em­ploy­ees to be sat­is­fied, and feel pos­i­tive and en­gaged with their job.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple who are sat­is­fied with their jobs tend to per­form bet­ter... Em­ploy­ees who feel pos­i­tive emo­tions at work are not only less likely to en­gage in neg­a­tive be­hav­iour, they are also more likely to help other col­leagues and per­form tasks that go be­yond their ba­sic job de­scrip­tion,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Dr Vic­tor Seah, se­nior lec­turer in psy­chol­ogy at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences, says un­hap­pi­ness at work is re­lated to job stress, de­creased men­tal health and lower lev­els of life sat­is­fac­tion. It also af­fects fam­ily life, he adds. Moth­ers who are un­happy and stressed at work tend to show less warmth and ac­cep­tance to­wards their chil­dren, while work­place un­hap­pi­ness is also as­so­ci­ated with fa­thers be­ing more in­clined to pun­ish­ing be­hav­iours.</p>
    <p>Un­hap­pi­ness can arise from a myr­iad of sources, such as feel­ing dis­re­spected or un­fairly treated, not feel­ing safe when pro­vid­ing feed­back, feel­ing overqual­i­fied, be­ing un­able to fit in with the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s cul­ture, or be­ing in con­flict with or even bul­lied by a col­league or su­pe­rior.</p>
    <p>ROLE OF STAFF</p>
    <p>Mr Seah says peo­ple who are tem­po­rar­ily un­happy can brush up on peo­ple man­age­ment skills, emo­tional mas­tery, time man­age­ment tech­niques and stress man­age­ment to bet­ter cope with the pres­sures they are fac­ing.</p>
    <p>Those who are deeply un­happy can plan a road map to leav­ing their job. This should in­clude mone­tary con­sid­er­a­tions and pick­ing up crit­i­cal skills.</p>
    <p>Those who are un­sure why they are dis­sat­is­fied at work can fo­cus on other as­pects of life rather than their ca­reer. For ex­am­ple, they can find joy in spend­ing time with their fam­ily or vol­un­teer­ing in­stead, says Mr Seah.</p>
    <p>Work­place psy­chol­o­gist Christo­pher Fong, who heads psy­chol­ogy stud­ies at Aven­tis School of Man­age­ment, rec­om­mends seiz­ing any op­por­tu­nity to learn new skills and har­ness a growth mind­set.</p>
    <p>Other sim­ple tips in­clude smil­ing more, dec­o­rat­ing your work space and mak­ing friends at work.</p>
    <p>You can also seek ca­reer guid­ance or talk to your boss about pro­gres­sion or train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Dr Seah says one sur­vey of vic­tims of work­place bul­ly­ing found that the top rec­om­men­da­tion the vic­tims gave was to leave the or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This was ahead of more ac­tive con­struc­tive strate­gies such as seek­ing sup­port, de­fend­ing one­self and en­gag­ing in clar­i­fi­ca­tion talks.</p>
    <p>Vic­tims of bul­ly­ing should try reeval­u­at­ing the sit­u­a­tion, ig­nor­ing in­stances of bul­ly­ing and avoid­ing interactio­ns with the bully, says Dr Seah. Trans­fer­ring to an­other job or quit­ting should be seen as a pos­si­ble last op­tion, he adds.</p>
    <p>ROLE OF EM­PLOY­ERS</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers can also in­crease their em­ploy­ees’ hap­pi­ness by giv­ing them more au­ton­omy and con­trol, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>They add that em­ploy­ers should also en­sure that there is jus­tice and fair­ness in deal­ing with re­sources, in­for­ma­tion and how pro­ce­dures are ap­plied.</p>
    <p>The Qualtrics sur­vey re­port found that, sur­pris­ingly, salary was not the big­gest driver of job sat­is­fac­tion among work­ers here.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the main trig­gers are con­fi­dence in the com­pany’s se­nior lead­er­ship team, a help­ful man­ager in re­solv­ing work-re­lated is­sues and get­ting suf­fi­cient train­ing to per­form the job ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>Dr Seah sug­gests align­ing per­for­mance ap­praisal and bonuses with hap­pi­ness-re­lated out­comes.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, man­age­ment bonuses can be pegged to a re­duc­tion in vol­un­tary turnover.</p>
    <p>Prof Tov notes that feel­ing happy or un­happy has dif­fer­ent con­se­quences for the work­place.</p>
    <p>“Try­ing to make sure that em­ploy­ees are not un­happy is im­por­tant, but so is find­ing ways to en­hance their abil­ity to feel good at work,” he says.</p>
    <p>A new tripartite ad­vi­sory on men­tal well-be­ing at work­places is­sued ear­lier this month en­cour­ages em­ploy­ers to – among other things – pro­vide ac­cess to coun­selling ser­vices, pos­si­bly through Em­ployee As­sis­tance Pro­grammes, to al­low staff to speak to a pro­fes­sional about chal­lenges they face at work and else­where.</p>
    <p>This is how Dr Fong helped an as­sis­tant hu­man re­sources (HR) man­ager in the ho­tel in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The man was un­happy as he be­lieved he should be up for a pro­mo­tion to HR man­ager, after the hard work he had put in for four years.</p>
    <p>He of­ten asked if he would be pro­moted soon and planned to re­sign if the or­gan­i­sa­tion of­fered him no ad­vance­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>His bosses told him to craft a per­sonal de­vel­op­ment plan to­wards be­com­ing a man­ager and as­signed him Dr Fong as coun­sel­lor.</p>
    <p>“Many times, he be­came un­happy, frus­trated and wanted to quit, but align­ing him back to his vi­sion of want­ing to be a man­ager gave him a strong pur­pose to carry on,” says Dr Fong.</p>
    <p>Work­ing on a per­sonal de­vel­op­ment plan also pro­vided a struc­tured frame­work for him to ac­count for his own learn­ing and ca­reer de­vel­op­ment and take re­spon­si­bil­ity in ar­eas that needed im­prove­ment, adds Dr Fong.</p>
    <p>After six months, the man im­pressed his bosses and won the pro­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>While hap­pi­ness at work is im­por­tant, Dr Fong notes that set­ting hap­pi­ness as the pri­mary goal might lead peo­ple to feel the op­po­site.</p>
    <p>“Why? Hap­pi­ness, like all emo­tions, is a fleet­ing state, never a per­ma­nent one. Hence, find­ing pur­pose and mean­ing to your work is the best so­lu­tion,” he says.</p>
