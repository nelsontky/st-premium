    <p>Sin­ga­pore is likely to see neg­a­tive eco­nomic growth of mi­nus 3 per cent or 4 per cent, or more, this year as a re­sult of the two-month cir­cuit breaker and on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But PM Lee stressed that his fo­cus is not on the ex­act growth fig­ure. He was speak­ing at a vir­tual di­a­logue held by the At­lantic Coun­cil, an Amer­i­can think-tank.</p>
    <p>“The key thing is: Which parts of the econ­omy can you pre­serve and op­er­ate nor­mally, and which parts have to be triaged and tran­si­tion into new ac­tiv­i­ties or new busi­ness mod­els,” he said. “And which parts will take some time to come back, and you have got to keep them sort of in sus­pended an­i­ma­tion un­til things come back to nor­mal.”</p>
    <p>This lat­ter cat­e­gory in­cludes sec­tors such as travel and trans­porta­tion, PM Lee said. “We have to try our best to keep those ca­pa­bil­i­ties in­tact so that when things come back to nor­mal again, once again SIA (Sin­ga­pore Air­lines) will be fly­ing, and once again we will be the best air­line in the world.”</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter was be­ing in­ter­viewed by Car­lyle Group co­founder David Ruben­stein for the At­lantic Coun­cil Front Page pro­gramme, which fea­tures a se­ries of vir­tual con­ver­sa­tions with top lead­ers from around the world.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the ses­sion, PM Lee was asked for his take on US-China trade re­la­tions, Sin­ga­pore’s re­sponse to the pan­demic and whether he was happy with the re­sults of the July 10 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“We are sat­is­fied with the re­sults,” PM Lee replied. “We had hoped for a higher pop­u­lar vote, but in the cir­cum­stances, we think it is a clear man­date, and we will make the most of it and serve Sin­ga­pore as best we can in the next five years.”</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party re­ceived 61.23 per cent of the pop­u­lar vote, about 4 per­cent­age points be­low the 65 per cent its lead­ers had hoped to ob­tain.</p>
    <p>On the ques­tion of large num­bers of Covid-19 cases in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries, PM Lee added that the sit­u­a­tion is now un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>“But then, of course, comes the chal­lenge of keep­ing the peo­ple con­tin­u­ing safe and clean, and al­low­ing them to go back to work with­out once again start­ing a cy­cle of in­fec­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>One viewer asked how Sin­ga­pore’s casi­nos and its na­tional car­rier have been cop­ing with the eco­nomic fall­out of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>PM Lee replied that both are cur­rently op­er­at­ing, al­though the flow of tourists to casi­nos has dwin­dled, as have pas­sen­ger loads on SIA’s air­craft. “We are ac­tively try­ing to de­velop green lanes and safe travel ar­range­ments with other coun­tries where Covid-19 is un­der con­trol, so that we can restart the traf­fic,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ruben­stein also asked about the fact that salaries drawn by gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials are com­pa­ra­ble to the private sec­tor’s, and if this is a con­tribut­ing fac­tor to the lack of cor­rup­tion in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>PM Lee re­sponded that it was one of sev­eral fac­tors. “But we still have this prob­lem, and from time to time we come across of­fi­cials at many lev­els – some quite high ones, oc­ca­sion­ally – who have suc­cumbed to temp­ta­tion, and we have to act against them zeal­ously,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Even if it is em­bar­rass­ing or awk­ward for us, we have to do it. Be­cause if we didn’t do it, then that is the end of the sys­tem, and you will not be able to main­tain the in­tegrity and the rep­u­ta­tion which we have built up over so many years.”</p>
    <p>WHAT PM LEE DOES TO RE­LAX</p>
    <p>I ex­er­cise: I walk, I do pi­lates. I take pho­to­graphs, I en­joy tak­ing pic­tures of peo­ple and of places in Sin­ga­pore. I try to keep my home com­puter net­work run­ning, but now I have two sons who are com­puter science grad­u­ates and they do it, and I am just a by­stander.</p>
    <p>’’ PRIME MIN­IS­TER LEE HSIEN LOONG, when asked if he does maths prob­lems or de­signs com­puter games to re­lax.</p>
