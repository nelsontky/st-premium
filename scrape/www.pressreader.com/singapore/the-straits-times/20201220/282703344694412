    <p>Get­ting a mas­ter’s de­gree in business ad­min­is­tra­tion is about a lot more than book learn­ing.</p>
    <p>It’s about the con­ver­sa­tions in class and the chance meet­ings be­fore and af­ter lec­tures. It’s about join­ing clubs that pro­mote a pro­fes­sional or per­sonal in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Above all, it’s about net­work­ing with fel­low stu­dents as well as with cor­po­rate re­cruiters and suc­cess­ful alumni who come to cam­pus – all in the hope of get­ting a ca­reer boost.</p>
    <p>It’s not about sit­ting alone in your apart­ment and star­ing at a Zoom screen for classes, net­work­ing and so­cial­is­ing. An­other vir­tual happy hour, any­one?</p>
    <p>And all this comes with a sub­stan­tial tab.</p>
    <p>Many of the top business schools cal­cu­late the to­tal an­nual cost – count­ing tu­ition, room and board – at more than US$100,000 (S$132,600), with some closer to US$120,000. That doesn’t in­clude the cost of not work­ing for two years. And the schools have not re­duced their tu­ition fees dur­ing this coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents in the MBA class of 2021 across the United States have been hit par­tic­u­larly hard. They be­gan their pro­gramme in the au­tumn of last year, and all went as usual un­til mid­way through the spring se­mes­ter, when classes went vir­tual and the long-planned in­ter­na­tional trips that typ­i­cally pop­u­late the se­mes­ter were can­celled.</p>
    <p>The lucky ones kept their sum­mer in­tern­ships, al­beit re­motely. For oth­ers, in­tern­ships were can­celled. And this school year has been more of the same.</p>
    <p>As to their job prospects at the end of all this? Stu­dents who want to work with large com­pa­nies in tra­di­tional fields such as con­sult­ing, fi­nance and tech­nol­ogy have gen­er­ally fared the best.</p>
    <p>Those who had hoped to join a start-up are still wait­ing, and those who had planned to go into fields that were dis­rupted by the pan­demic – real es­tate, hos­pi­tal­ity, even health­care – are fac­ing an un­cer­tain spring.</p>
    <p>“Is it worth US$200,000, plus what I could have been mak­ing?” asked Mr Ter­ence Mullin, who worked in in­vest­ment bank­ing and pri­vate equity in Chicago be­fore en­rolling at the Haas School of Business at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berke­ley, where all the classes now are on­line and the only ap­proved in­ter­ac­tion is via Zoom.</p>
    <p>“No.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mullin is among the stu­dents who had hoped to change ca­reers – to on­line gam­ing, in his case – and he has yet to re­ceive an of­fer.</p>
    <p>The cost of business school has long been high. Haas, as part of a public univer­sity, is on the less ex­pen­sive end of top pro­grammes, with yearly tu­ition cost­ing un­der US$70,000.</p>
    <p>Columbia Univer­sity’s grad­u­ate pro­gramme at its business school costs US$77,000 a year, with to­tal costs over two years es­ti­mated at US$235,000.</p>
    <p>“The MBA is a high-touch pro­gramme, and cov­er­ing our costs means we charge pretty high tu­ition,” said econ­o­mist Jonah Rock­off, who is se­nior vice-dean of cur­ricu­lum and pro­grammes at Columbia Business School.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways teach my stu­dents the big­gest cost of the MBA is the op­por­tu­nity cost of giv­ing up two years of in­come and ca­reer advancemen­t.”</p>
    <p>Aca­demics, which stu­dents in the past would of­ten say was the least of their rea­sons for go­ing to business school, is the area where the schools have had the most con­trol in trans­lat­ing in-per­son learn­ing to vir­tual or hy­brid mod­els.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents said the ef­fec­tive­ness de­pended as much on the course</p>
    <p>as how it was de­liv­ered.</p>
    <p>Mr Mullin said his ne­go­ti­a­tions class at Haas was prob­a­bly bet­ter on­line, since it in­volved just two stu­dents in a Zoom break­out room. But larger, core classes have been tough.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Vishesh Garg, a se­condyear stu­dent at Columbia who moved from In­dia to at­tend the pro­gramme: “Keep­ing your con­cen­tra­tion go­ing for three hours on Zoom, par­tic­u­larly if you have other classes, is hard.” He has opted to at­tend class in per­son when­ever it is of­fered, he said.</p>
    <p>Yale Univer­sity’s School of Man­age­ment has adopted a hy­brid model, where stu­dents can at­tend class on al­ter­nat­ing days or just go vir­tual.</p>
    <p>Mr David Arteaga-Caicedo, also in his sec­ond year of the pro­gramme, opted to at­tend vir­tu­ally, even though he lives i n New Haven, Con­necti­cut, where Yale is.</p>
    <p>“Part of the beauty of go­ing to class was the serendip­i­tous en­coun­ters,” he said. “Here, you’d go to class and then have to leave im­me­di­ately.”</p>
    <p>Those spon­ta­neous en­coun­ters are some­thing even the top-tier in­sti­tu­tions can­not recre­ate vir­tu­ally. “The pan­demic has taken the bulk of it away,” said Mr Ker­win Charles, dean of Yale’s business school.</p>
    <p>“I’ve said to sec­ond years that we will do all we can in a re­mote con­text or a re­mote mech­a­nism to carry on those ac­tiv­i­ties. But they’re not chance en­coun­ters.”</p>
    <p>When it comes to trav­el­ling for class work or with class­mates – which many stu­dents cite as cru­cial to their se­lec­tion of a business school – that is not hap­pen­ing. Nor are the in­ter­ac­tions with in­ter­na­tional stu­dents – many of whom went home in the spring and have strug­gled to re­turn.</p>
    <p>Ms Megan Re­ichert said she had cho­sen Haas over other business schools be­cause of two classes: in­ter­na­tional business de­vel­op­ment and ex­treme lead­er­ship, which ends with a hik­ing trek in the An­des. Nei­ther hap­pened.</p>
    <p>But she said she had gained some un­ex­pected skills as one of the lead­ers of the spring pro­ject for her in­ter­na­tional business de­vel­op­ment class, in which the stu­dents ad­vised a Chi­nese cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“I was in a po­si­tion to say this is not what I or any­one on our team signed on for, but nor was it what the cor­po­ra­tion had signed on to,” Ms Re­ichert said.</p>
    <p>“I just re­shaped the pro­ject en­tirely around what peo­ple needed. It was a very unique op­por­tu­nity to lead through what was very dis­ap­point­ing, frus­trat­ing news.”</p>
    <p>Stu­dents who went to business school to change ca­reers are, in some cases, find­ing that the pan­demic has put up new chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents who took of­fers from larger com­pa­nies last au­tumn for their sum­mer in­tern­ships may end up in a bet­ter po­si­tion than those who waited un­til the spring, when smaller com­pa­nies and start-ups usu­ally come call­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Arteaga-Caicedo had been trad­ing metal de­riv­a­tives in New York be­fore go­ing to Yale. He wanted to go into con­sult­ing and se­cured an in­tern­ship be­fore the pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>He did an in­tern­ship at a con­sult­ing firm vir­tu­ally and has al­ready ac­cepted a job of­fer for next year.</p>
    <p>“I feel very for­tu­nate,” he said. “The pan­demic has forced me to think about my pri­or­i­ties as well. I’ve been able to step back and pause and ask, ‘What do you re­ally want to do?’”</p>
    <p>Ms Re­ichert had the op­po­site ex­pe­ri­ence. She in­terned at Chewy, the pet food web­site, this past sum­mer, but she did so from her par­ents’ home in Spot­syl­va­nia County, Vir­ginia – 1,600km from Chewy’s head­quar­ters in Da­nia Beach, Florida.</p>
    <p>While she com­mended the com­pany for its ef­forts to make the most out of a bad sit­u­a­tion, she de­cided to re­turn to con­sult­ing in­stead.</p>
    <p>LOS­ING CON­CEN­TRA­TION</p>
    <p>Keep­ing your con­cen­tra­tion go­ing for three hours on Zoom, par­tic­u­larly if you have other classes, is hard.</p>
    <p>MR VISHESH GARG, a sec­ond-year stu­dent at Columbia, who moved from In­dia to at­tend the pro­gramme.</p>
