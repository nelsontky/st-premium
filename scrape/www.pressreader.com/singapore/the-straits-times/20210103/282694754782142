    <p>A VERY DE­TER­MINED PER­SON</p>
    <p>I am a firm be­liever that in­sur­ance com­pa­nies should al­ways be look­ing for a rea­son to pay a claim and not rea­sons to not pay a claim.</p>
    <p>(That think­ing) will get through in time; I am a very de­ter­mined per­son.</p>
    <p>MR LEE YUAN SIONG, chief ex­ec­u­tive and pres­i­dent of AIA Group.</p>
    <p>Ever since Mr Lee Yuan Siong came to my no­tice a few years ago as the Sin­ga­porean who helped power Ping An to be China’s No. 1 in­surer, I’d been look­ing for­ward to an op­por­tu­nity to meet this Chi­na­town-boy-made-good.</p>
    <p>Like Hong Kong-based Mil­ton Cheng, who is global chair of gi­ant Amer­i­can law firm Baker McKen­zie, Mr Lee was one of those Sin­ga­pore­ans whose ca­reers and per­sonal jour­neys prof­ited im­mensely by step­ping out of the com­fort zone of this balmy is­land.</p>
    <p>How­ever, be­ing based in Shen­zhen, China, he was not a man you bumped into around town. Nev­er­the­less, he cast a for­mi­da­ble shadow over Asian C-suites.</p>
    <p>Re­tail fi­nan­cial ser­vices, which he led, was said to have brought in 90 per cent of the Ping An group op­er­at­ing profit.</p>
    <p>When he joined the firm in 2004, it had a 200,000 agency force. At its peak, that num­ber went to</p>
    <p>1.4 mil­lion. It had taken Mr Lee only six years to take Ping An from a dis­tant No. 2 in China to top in­surer.</p>
    <p>Now that he’s the chief ex­ec­u­tive and pres­i­dent of the gi­ant AIA Group, I had the op­por­tu­nity to spend a lit­tle less than two hours with the for­mer Ping An rain­maker for whom the Hong Kong-based in­surer re­port­edly pro­vided a sign­ing-on pack­age of more than US$28 mil­lion (S$37 mil­lion) to com­pen­sate for un­vested long-term re­ward and de­ferred pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Not bad for the Chi­na­town lad who par­layed a Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) schol­ar­ship into a re­mark­able ca­reer in in­sur­ance, start­ing with MAS it­self, then on to pri­vate-sec­tor po­si­tions with Pru­den­tial, Ping An and now, AIA.</p>
    <p>In June, when he took charge of sto­ried AIA, he had been re­port­edly the high­est-paid ex­ec­u­tive in China’s in­sur­ance in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>It speaks for both Mr Lee’s smarts and China’s ac­cep­tance of global tal­ent that the Shen­zhen-based firm would wel­come a non-main­land-born per­son into its se­nior ranks and pro­mote him so rapidly.</p>
    <p>The ride wasn’t easy. When he quit his re­gional role with Pru­den­tial to join Ping An, the Chi­nese in­surer was emerg­ing from a mis-sell­ing con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>It took three years to fix but the job was done, and that laid the foun­da­tions for growth.</p>
    <p>And he also turned Ping An from an in­sur­ance play to an in­te­grated fi­nan­cial ser­vices com­pany.</p>
    <p>Agents sold not just life in­sur­ance but also mo­tor in­sur­ance, health in­sur­ance, em­ployee ben­e­fits, credit cards, bank de­posits, trust prod­ucts and se­cu­ri­ties ac­counts.</p>
    <p>At one time, they were sell­ing 17 dif­fer­ent types of ser­vices and prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The other high point was re­cruit­ing a team to build up Ping An Health­care and Tech­nol­ogy, the telemedici­ne plat­form that now has about 200 mil­lion users and han­dles hun­dreds of thou­sands of con­sul­ta­tions a day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a share sale in 2018, Ping An Good Doc­tor, as it is now called, has a HK$108 bil­lion (S$18.5 bil­lion) mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>These, clearly, were ca­reer-defin­ing ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Now, his chal­lenge is to use all that he knows and has ex­pe­ri­enced to help AIA in the world’s big­gest emerg­ing mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Al­though founded in Shang­hai in 1919, AIA only re-en­tered China in 1992 and to­day, it is the only fully for­eign-owned in­surer al­lowed to op­er­ate in the main­land.</p>
    <p>“AIA picked me for my China ex­pe­ri­ence, es­pe­cially my track record with Ping An. Be­cause I went there early, I have a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the lo­cal cul­ture,” says Mr Lee. “Se­condly, be­cause of tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“And then, I also have a wealth of re­gional ex­pe­ri­ence work­ing with Pru­den­tial and help­ing it grow from an in­ter­na­tional out­post of a Bri­tish com­pany to a very suc­cess­ful re­gional player in 12 mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>Aside from the brag­ging rights of head­ing the big­gest pan-Asian in­surer, Mr Lee, whose in­cred­i­ble per­sonal fit­ness he cred­its to reg­u­lar ex­er­cise and proper sleep habits, clearly rel­ishes challenges.</p>
    <p>Pulling AIA out of its Covid-19-re­lated funk in the first half of last year was one such chal­lenge – se­cond-half re­sults that will soon be pub­lished are ex­pected to show a strong turn­around. In­vestors have no­ticed; AIA shares ended last year trad­ing at HK$95, close to its 52-week high.</p>
    <p>The other chal­lenge is to up AIA’s tech­nol­ogy game and his Ping An record should prove handy.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee had set the Chi­nese firm on a dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion jour­ney long be­fore the term be­came fash­ion­able. Cus­tomers were en­cour­aged to stay in touch with the com­pany through the In­ter­net and soft­ware was pro­vided for agency man­agers to use.</p>
    <p>It was a long jour­ney, but by the time 2010 came round, every­thing was pa­per­less. You could talk to an agent, pick poli­cies, pay and have the pol­icy is­sued in­stan­ta­neously.</p>
    <p>“AIA has a plan to im­prove its tech­nol­ogy, dig­i­tal and an­a­lyt­ics ca­pa­bil­i­ties to pre­pare it­self for the fu­ture and I thought it’s some­thing I can con­trib­ute to,” says Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>“Plus the fact that AIA is known to be the best life in­sur­ance com­pany in Asia and prob­a­bly the world. When I was in Ping An, in­vestors like Cap­i­tal Group used to ask me, ‘So, when are you go­ing to catch up with AIA?’. Now, I can tell them I’ve caught up!”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, 55, says he has set him­self up for two, pos­si­bly three, terms in of­fice of three years each. The Covid-19 pan­demic helped fo­cus think­ing not just for him­self but also about the wider in­dus­try and health in gen­eral. It ac­cel­er­ated trends that un­der­pin the at­trac­tive­ness of Asia’s life and health in­sur­ance mar­ket, and the gaps in pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer mind­sets are chang­ing, mean­while. Peo­ple are more ac­cept­ing of re­mote work and work­ing dig­i­tally. There also is a flight to qual­ity that’s prov­ing to be a tail­wind.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, there are huge un­tapped op­por­tu­ni­ties in China, where prov­inces can be the size of na­tions, and In­dia, where it has a 49:51 joint ven­ture with Tata Group, that should pro­vide years of good growth.</p>
    <p>China is top pri­or­ity. Last year, AIA was al­lowed to sub­sidiarise its branch op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Now, AIA is set to rapidly spread across the vast na­tion from three mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties – Bei­jing, Shang­hai and Tian­jin – and three prov­inces.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, the In­dian mar­ket grew last year and Tata-AIA ac­tu­ally improved mar­ket share, de­spite the Asian na­tion be­ing the most se­verely af­fected by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Stuck in Hong Kong be­cause of travel re­stric­tions, AIA man­age­ment could not es­cape their new CEO, he says. Through Zoom calls and Mi­crosoft Teams, they patched in the var­i­ous coun­try heads and to­gether ham­mered out a strat­egy that was rolled out in August.</p>
    <p>One half of that plan is to move swiftly up the tech­nol­ogy scale with higher dig­i­tal adop­tion and pre­dic­tive an­a­lyt­ics. The other is to seize the 101-year-old firm and de-layer it, cut­ting down si­los and mov­ing to an ag­ile work en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Es­pe­cially in emerg­ing and de­vel­op­ing mar­kets, he says, it is pos­si­ble to grow the dis­tri­bu­tion net­work swiftly with­out com­pro­mis­ing on high qual­ity and stan­dards. Lessons learnt in</p>
    <p>In­dia’s ex­plod­ing mar­ket, for in­stance, are now be­ing ap­plied in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>AIA, he says, will also be or­gan­ised around the cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence, re­gard­less of whether it is ser­vic­ing in­di­vid­u­als or group cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“I am a firm be­liever that in­sur­ance com­pa­nies should al­ways be look­ing for a rea­son to pay a claim and not rea­sons to not pay a claim. (That think­ing) will get through in time; I am a very de­ter­mined per­son.”</p>
    <p>The other trend emerg­ing from AIA un­der his watch is in­te­grat­ing well­ness man­age­ment into health­care and in­sur­ance out­comes, and shar­ing the gains by low­er­ing pre­mi­ums for the cus­tomer. In short, in­flu­enc­ing cus­tomer be­hav­iour in the di­rec­tion of wise, responsibl­e life­style choices – ex­er­cise more, drink and smoke less. The re­sults, he says, have been good, es­pe­cially in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It’s im­pos­si­ble to not no­tice that AIA is sit­ting on a US$12 bil­lion cash pile and that begs the ques­tion: What do you plan to do with it?</p>
    <p>Mr Lee notes AIA’s pro­gres­sive div­i­dend pol­icy – a 5 per cent div­i­dend in­crease was an­nounced dur­ing the in­terim re­sults and paid out.</p>
    <p>“The re­turn on in­vest­ments we get from new busi­ness in­vest­ment is above 20 per cent, right? So, we’ll al­ways be look­ing for new busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties to in­vest into.”</p>
    <p>AIA, he says, will stay fo­cused on Asia with pri­or­ity given to grow­ing the core busi­nesses of life and health in­sur­ance. So if, say, a ban­cas­sur­ance re­la­tion­ship comes avail­able and the eco­nomics makes sense, AIA will look at it closely. Same with life, and health busi­ness. The pur­chase of ING’s Malaysian life in­sur­ance busi­ness some years ago, he says, turned out to be a sound de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>This is Sin­ga­pore, and Asia, where Euro­pean foot­ball is tracked closely across coun­tries. AIA spon­sors Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur in the English Premier League and I ask how that re­la­tion­ship is work­ing out. Is Jose Mour­inho’s job safe?</p>
    <p>The foot­ball-lov­ing Lee proves adept at block­ing a tight ques­tion, and de­flect­ing it.</p>
    <p>“We have a very good re­la­tion­ship with Spurs, not just in terms of brand­ing but cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity ini­tia­tives and so on,” he says. “I am happy to see that they are per­form­ing very well. They are a very per­for­mance-ori­ented or­gan­i­sa­tion, so if he per­forms well, I am sure Spurs will keep him.”</p>
    <p>What about his own de­ci­sion to leave Sin­ga­pore, and seek a ca­reer out­side the is­land. Did that work out?</p>
    <p>“If I didn’t ven­ture out back in the 90s, I be­lieve I would still be suc­cess­ful, but I wouldn’t be the CEO of AIA,” he says.</p>
