    <p>CATAIN­GAN (Philip­pines) • At least one per­son was killed and 43 in­jured when a 6.6-mag­ni­tude earth­quake shook the cen­tral Philip­pines yes­ter­day, send­ing res­i­dents flee­ing from their homes and dam­ag­ing build­ings and roads.</p>
    <p>The shal­low quake struck south­east of Mas­bate Is­land in the Bi­col re­gion at 8.03am, the United States Ge­o­log­i­cal Sur­vey said.</p>
    <p>“There are a l ot of dam­aged houses,” said Staff Sergeant An­to­nio Cle­mente in Catain­gan, a town of about 50,000 peo­ple on the im­pov­er­ished is­land sev­eral kilo­me­tres west of the epi­cen­tre in the Sa­mar Sea. “It was re­ally strong.”</p>
    <p>Lo­cal ra­dio sta­tion re­porter Christo­pher De­ca­mon said he saw emer­gency work­ers pull the body of a man from the rub­ble of a three­storey house on the out­skirts of Catain­gan. The man’s wife es­caped un­harmed.</p>
    <p>“Our peo­ple were broad­cast­ing at the time, but they just ran out of the build­ing,” Mr De­ca­mon told AFP. Po­lice con­firmed the man’s death. Six­teen peo­ple were in­jured in the town. In nearby Palanas, at least 27 were in­jured after be­ing hit by fall­ing ob­jects or when their mo­tor­bikes crashed as the ground moved, Mr Chris Adique, a mu­nic­i­pal dis­as­ter of­fi­cer, told DZBB ra­dio.</p>
    <p>None were in a crit­i­cal con­di­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>Search and res­cue ef­forts were still un­der way in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The quake struck as the ar­chi­pel­ago bat­tles surg­ing num­bers of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, with more than 164,000 cases and move­ment re­stric­tions that vary across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“These nat­u­ral dis­as­ters are a part of our lives and we al­ways re­cover,” said Mr Harry Roque, spokesman for Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte. “Peo­ple should not worry about get­ting re­lief as­sis­tance. (It) will be pro­vided.”</p>
    <p>Cap­tain Alvin Gue­rina, Palanas po­lice chief, told AFP that sev­eral pa­tients, in­clud­ing a preg­nant woman about to go into labour, were evac­u­ated from a hos­pi­tal as a pre­cau­tion in case of af­ter­shocks.</p>
    <p>So far, at least 24 af­ter­shocks have been recorded by the Philip­pine seis­mol­ogy of­fice, with the strong­est reg­is­ter­ing at a mag­ni­tude of 3.8.</p>
    <p>A video posted on Face­book and ver­i­fied by AFP showed light dam­age to a food mar­ket in Catain­gan.</p>
    <p>Over­turned buck­ets and small fish were scat­tered on the ground, and chunks of cement had fallen from a pil­lar. Peo­ple stood out­side on the street.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines is si­t­u­ated on the Pa­cific Ring of Fire, an arc of in­tense seis­mic ac­tiv­ity that stretches from Ja­pan through South-east Asia and across the Pa­cific basin.</p>
