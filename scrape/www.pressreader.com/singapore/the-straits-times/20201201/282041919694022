    <p>The Hous­ing Board has ap­pointed Mr Tan Meng Dui as its new chief ex­ec­u­tive, as part of changes in the agency’s se­nior lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Start­ing Feb 26 next year, he will take over from Dr Cheong Koon Hean, 63, who has been HDB’s chief ex­ec­u­tive since 2010, the</p>
    <p>Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment and HDB said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, 53, is cur­rently the chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA), an ap­point­ment he has held since Oc­to­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>From Jan 1 to Feb 25 next year, Mr Fong Chun Wah, HDB’s cur­rent deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive of build­ings, will be ap­pointed act­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>Mr Luke Goh, 45, who is cur­rently the deputy sec­re­tary of trade at the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try, will suc­ceed Mr Tan as NEA’s chief ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>Dr Cheong, who will re­lin­quish her role as HDB’s chief ex­ec­u­tive on Jan 1, over­saw the for­mu­la­tion and re­view of hous­ing poli­cies and build­ing pro­grammes through­out her decade-long ser­vice. Th­ese in­clude the Build-To-Or­der, En­hance­ment for Ac­tive Se­niors, Home Im­prove­ment Pro­gramme and Lift Up­grad­ing Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Trained as an ar­chi­tect-plan­ner, she spear­headed sev­eral HDB ini­tia­tives, in­clud­ing the ex­pan­sion of hous­ing op­tions for low-in</p>
    <p>come house­holds and the en­hance­ment of hous­ing grants to ben­e­fit more first-time home buy­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Cheong also in­tro­duced the smart HDB town frame­work, which guides the ap­pli­ca­tion of smart tech­nolo­gies to make HDB towns and es­tates more live­able, and the bio­philic town frame­work, which in­cor­po­rates as­pects of the nat­u­ral en­vi­ron­ment into all pub­lic hous­ing de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>She will be suc­ceeded by Mr Tan, who led the SG Clean cam­paign in Fe­bru­ary, at the start of the Covid-19 out­break, to gal­vanise col­lec­tive ac­tion from in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses in or­der to keep pub­lic premises clean and thus re­duce the risk of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>He also over­saw the rapid de­vel­op­ment of waste­water-based sur­veil­lance ca­pa­bil­ity to as­sess Covid-19 trans­mis­sion in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries, and the for­mu­la­tion of a na­tional strat­egy for waste­water test­ing for the pur­pose of dis­ease sur­veil­lance within the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his two years at NEA, he over­saw the de­vel­op­ment of im­proved in­fra­struc­ture to en­hance re­cy­cling, such as dual chutes for non-landed hous­ing de­vel­op­ments and new re­cy­cling la­bels un­der the Na­tional Re­cy­cling Pro­gramme, re­viewed and en­hanced the So­cial En­ter­prise Hawker Cen­tre model, and im­ple­mented Sin­ga­pore’s first no-smok­ing zone in Or­chard Road, among other things.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Tan’s lead­er­ship, NEA led the Gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to the haze sit­u­a­tion last year and man­aged the record dengue out­break this year.</p>
