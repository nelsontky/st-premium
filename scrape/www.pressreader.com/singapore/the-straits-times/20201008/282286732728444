    <p>PARIS Pe­tra Kvi­tova re­turned to the French Open semi-fi­nals for the first time in eight years yes­ter­day af­ter de­feat­ing Ger­many’s Laura Siege­mund 6-3, 6-3, de­scrib­ing Roland Gar­ros as her “lucky place”.</p>
    <p>Czech sev­enth seed Kvi­tova, a two-time Wim­ble­don cham­pion, will face Aus­tralian Open cham­pion Sofia Kenin to­day for a place in the fi­nal on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“It means a lot to be back in the semi-fi­nals,” said 30-year-old Kvi­tova, who was beaten by even­tual cham­pion Maria Shara­pova when she made the same stage in 2012.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter my last match, I was very emo­tional to be in the quar­ter-fi­nals. Now I am in the semis. I never imag­ined this would hap­pen af­ter ev­ery­thing that has hap­pened. “This is my lucky place.”</p>
    <p>It was Paris where Kvi­tova made her come­back in 2017 af­ter spend­ing six months re­cov­er­ing from a ter­ri­fy­ing knife at­tack at her home in De­cem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>The fren­zied as­sault re­quired a four-hour op­er­a­tion and left her with dam­aged lig­a­ments in her play­ing hand. Doc­tors warned her that her ca­reer might be fin­ished.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, she fired 22 win­ners and six aces past 32-year-old Siege­mund, the world No. 66 who was play­ing in the quar­ter-fi­nals of a Slam for the first time.</p>
    <p>One break of serve in the opener was enough for Kvi­tova while five more breaks fol­lowed in the sec­ond set. The world No. 11, who has yet to drop a set at this tour­na­ment, claimed vic­tory when Siege­mund com­mit­ted her third dou­ble fault.</p>
    <p>“I am happy to be here and to be able to com­pete with the best es­pe­cially in these con­di­tions – roof open, roof closed, sun­shine, windy,” Kvi­tova added.</p>
    <p>In the later match, Kenin moved two wins from a sec­ond Grand Slam ti­tle of the year when she de­feated Amer­i­can com­pa­triot Danielle Collins to reach the semi­fi­nals. The 21-year-old fourth seed pre­vailed 6-4, 4-6, 6-0.</p>
    <p>Collins re­quired treat­ment on an ab­domen in­jury at 4-0 down in the de­cider, a con­di­tion not helped by her high-pitched screams of “come on” which be­came pro­gres­sively louder as the tie went on.</p>
    <p>The other semi-fi­nal sees Pol­ish 19-year-old Iga Swiatek tackle Ar­gentina’s Na­dia Podor­oska, the world No. 131 who is bid­ding to be­come the first qual­i­fier to reach the fi­nal of a Grand Slam.</p>
    <p>In the men’s draw, Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas reached his sec­ond Grand Slam semi-fi­nal yes­ter­day with a straight-set win over An­drey Rublev to set up a meet­ing against ei­ther world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic or Pablo Car­reno Busta.</p>
    <p>The Greek fifth seed avenged last month’s loss to Rublev in the Ham­burg fi­nal by de­feat­ing the Rus­sian 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 to match his break­out run at the Aus­tralian Open last year.</p>
    <p>The other semi-fi­nal will see</p>
    <p>Diego Schwartz­man fac­ing 12-time cham­pion Rafael Nadal of Spain, whom he beat in the quar­ter-fi­nals of the Ital­ian Open last month.</p>
    <p>The 12th seeded Ar­gen­tinian had on Tues­day downed a tired Do­minic Thiem in an epic 7-6 (7-1), 5-7, 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 win in the quar­ter-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>Thiem, a fi­nal­ist at Roland Gar­ros in the last two years, had won his pre­vi­ous 11 Slam matches fol­low­ing his US Open vic­tory last month.</p>
    <p>“I was over the limit to­day,” said the Aus­trian third seed who had come through an­other five-set­ter to knock out French wild card Hugo Gas­ton in the pre­vi­ous round.</p>
