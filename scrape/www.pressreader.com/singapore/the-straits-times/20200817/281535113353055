    <p>A scheme to help work­ers in the re­tail and aerospace in­dus­tries is in the works. It could see work­ers matched with sur­ro­gate em­ploy­ers and trained while wait­ing for the job mar­ket to im­prove. Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion pres­i­dent Robert Yap said that the group aims to roll it out within 12 months.</p>
    <p>A scheme to help work­ers in the hard-hit re­tail and aerospace in­dus­tries is in the works, where they could be matched with sur­ro­gate em­ploy­ers and trained while wait­ing for the job mar­ket to im­prove.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion (SNEF) pres­i­dent Robert Yap told The Straits Times that the group is in dis­cus­sions with var­i­ous part­ners on the pro­gramme, and aims to roll it out within 12 months after de­tails are firmed up.</p>
    <p>It would see work­ers be­ing em­ployed by com­pa­nies for pos­si­bly six to 12 months un­der a struc­tured cur­ricu­lum so that they gain in­dus­tryrel­e­vant skills.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment would sub­sidise the salaries of the work­ers. Later on, they can be de­ployed to other firms.</p>
    <p>The re­tail in­dus­try em­ployed about 158,800 peo­ple here as of March, while the aerospace sec­tor em­ploys around 22,000. The sec­tors have been badly af­fected by travel re­stric­tions and the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures to stem the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>To fur­ther boost trans­for­ma­tion in the re­tail sec­tor, SNEF is also push­ing for a new na­tional or­der man­age­ment plat­form that would make it eas­ier for dif­fer­ent play­ers – from re­tail­ers and mall land­lords to e-com­merce com­pa­nies and last-mile de­liv­ery firms – to process or­ders seam­lessly, rather than have mul­ti­ple, small plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The move would also make Sin­ga­pore more com­pet­i­tive, said Mr Yap, who is also ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of lo­gis­tics group YCH.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that though there are ex­ist­ing in­ter­na­tional e-com­merce plat­forms, some small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) lack the dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties or the abil­ity to ne­go­ti­ate with the plat­form own­ers to get good terms.</p>
    <p>The aim is for the en­tire re­tail sec­tor to be trans­formed, which will re­sult in more de­mand for skilled work­ers, who would have been trained up by the sur­ro­gate em­ployer pro­gramme, he said.</p>
    <p>“They can go to re­tail­ers, they can go to brand own­ers, they can go to all the mom-and-pop SME com­pa­nies that will need these skills to help them in this trans­for­ma­tion jour­ney,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap was speak­ing to ST after Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said ear­lier this month that the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil would con­vene for a sec­ond time this year.</p>
    <p>This will oc­cur later this month, and the coun­cil aims to re­lease up­dated guide­lines by next month.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap, a coun­cil mem­ber, said the group’s fo­cus this year is on help­ing com­pa­nies trans­form quickly, and also see how their wage pol­icy can be con­sis­tent with the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap said SNEF is work­ing to pro­vide more coach­ing ser­vices on how to make the most of govern­ment grants so that SMEs can sur­vive the eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>He also hopes for more govern­ment sup­port for large lo­cal en­ter­prises which have Sin­ga­porean work­ers at heart.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay had, dur­ing the Bud­get de­bate in Fe­bru­ary, mooted bring­ing back the Sur­ro­gate Em­ployer Pro­gramme, which NTUC worked with the Govern­ment to ad­min­is­ter from 2001 to around 2011.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme gave union mem­bers ab­sen­tee pay­roll and course fee fund­ing if they were keen to up­grade their skills without the sup­port of their em­ploy­ers. NTUC func­tioned as a sur­ro­gate em­ployer to them.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem said yes­ter­day that SNEF’s planned scheme ap­pears to pro­vide not just a stop-gap mea­sure to keep avi­a­tion and re­tail work­ers in jobs, but a longer-term so­lu­tion to reskill them for fu­ture growth sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Yap said that even as SNEF pushes for more help for busi­nesses to sur­vive the cri­sis, not all are “sal­vage­able”, es­pe­cially if their busi­ness mod­els are no longer rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>“If they stick on to where they are and hope for a life­line, they can only ex­tend a cou­ple of months, but it doesn’t mean that they will be able to get through (the cri­sis). At the end, it would be also a dead end,” he said.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus on the Sin­ga­porean core should not be taken to the ex­treme, with Sin­ga­pore be­com­ing too closed to tal­ent from be­yond its shores, said Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion (SNEF) pres­i­dent Robert Yap.</p>
    <p>Some for­eign­ers with spe­cialised skills are needed to fill gaps and train lo­cals so that com­pa­nies here can be com­pet­i­tive. Also, a de­gree of di­ver­sity pro­vides a bench­mark or “spar­ring part­ner” for lo­cal work­ers to build upon, he said.</p>
    <p>“That kind of scheme must al­ways be there... Other­wise, we are just fight­ing our­selves, we think we are the cham­pion, but (we are) cham­pion only in Siglap. We want to be the cham­pion glob­ally. Just like you com­pete to be Miss Sungei Road. But Miss Sungei Road is only Miss Sungei Road, what about Miss Uni­verse?</p>
    <p>“We must have a bal­ance, other­wise we be­come too closed, then we will lose our com­pet­i­tive edge, we lose our own in­stincts, our lo­cal pop­u­la­tion’s in­stinct to ac­tu­ally be the best be­cause we think we are al­ready the best,” he said.</p>
    <p>At the same time, he hopes there can be more govern­ment sup­port for large lo­cal en­ter­prises or homegrown multi­na­tion­als so that more Sin­ga­pore­ans can take on top man­age­ment po­si­tions with wider port­fo­lios, he said in an in­ter­view last week with The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Such com­pa­nies would push for a Sin­ga­porean core with their heart, com­pared with some other com­pa­nies which may just do the bare min­i­mum, added Mr Yap, 68, who is ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of lo­gis­tics group YCH.</p>
    <p>He also re­sponded to Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay’s re­cent sug­ges­tion that the au­thor­i­ties pub­lish the names of com­pa­nies placed on its Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work watch list for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Re­peat of­fend­ers who have no re­spect for the sys­tem should be named, though he does not think this is nec­es­sary for those who make the mis­take once or are merely sus­pected of bi­ased hir­ing.</p>
    <p>“Once you... name and shame, ac­tu­ally, it is very, very, very bad for the com­pany in terms of em­ploy­ment and also its im­age and... so that could cre­ate too many ad­verse ef­fects,” he said.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing also on the Man­power Min­istry’s move to pro­vide weekly up­dates on the job sit­u­a­tion – such as up­dates on re­trench­ments and sec­tors with job va­can­cies – Mr Yap said this would be use­ful for em­ploy­ers and trade as­so­ci­a­tions. They can try to match spare em­ploy­ees with em­ploy­ers who need work­ers.</p>
    <p>KEEP­ING COM­PET­I­TIVE EDGE</p>
    <p>We must have a bal­ance, other­wise we be­come too closed, then we will lose our com­pet­i­tive edge, we lose our own in­stincts, our lo­cal pop­u­la­tion’s in­stinct to ac­tu­ally be the best be­cause we think we are al­ready the best. ’’</p>
