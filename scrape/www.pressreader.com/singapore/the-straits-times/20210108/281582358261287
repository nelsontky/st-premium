    <p>Malaysia an­nounced on Jan 2 that gov­ern­ment schools will re­open as sched­uled on Jan 20, de­spite new coron­avirus in­fec­tions stay­ing stub­bornly high. Par­ents and ex­perts have dif­fer­ing views on the mat­ter, with some fear­ing out­breaks and oth­ers wel­com­ing a re­turn to in-per­son learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Eleven-year-old Hakim has not gone to school since it was closed in Oc­to­ber last year af­ter a third wave of Covid-19 hit Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Now, he spends his days do­ing house­hold chores in his fam­ily’s two-bed­room flat in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>“We can’t af­ford to buy a new smart­phone, let alone a tablet. I wish we could get just a cheap tablet so he can join the on­line classes at his school,” his mother Liana Ma­lik told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“He misses school and wants to be a good stu­dent as he feels it is a chance to im­prove our lives. But he finds it hard to catch up and re­vise on his own, and we don’t have a printer to print out work­sheets sent by the teacher,” said the 44-year-old ho­tel worker.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Malaysia an­nounced that gov­ern­ment schools will re­open as sched­uled on Jan 20, de­spite new Covid-19 in­fec­tions stay­ing stub­bornly high. The num­ber of daily cases hit a new record of 3,027 cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Par­ents and ex­perts have dif­fer­ing views on whether stu­dents should re­turn to class­rooms – some fear out­breaks while oth­ers wel­come a re­turn to in-per­son learn­ing, cit­ing a lack of ac­cess to on­line learn­ing and poor men­tal health.</p>
    <p>House­wife Ju­lia Muhamad, 40, who is from Se­lan­gor, said: “I re­ally want my kids to go back to school be­cause they need so­cial in­ter­ac­tion. How­ever, as a par­ent, I am not without wor­ries. But we can’t live in fear for­ever and we need to try to re­sume a new nor­mal life some­how.”</p>
    <p>On the other hand, house­wife Rina Razali, 40, prefers to keep her chil­dren at home. “It feels a bit fu­tile. (If) school re­opens and... there’s a case of some­one with Covid-19, then the school will have a to­tal shut­down, with the (par­ents) wor­ry­ing sick if their kids may have been in­fected as well.”</p>
    <p>The other worry is that re­open­ing schools may fur­ther strain public hospi­tal re­sources if there are out­breaks. Ear­lier this month, the Health Min­istry said it was mulling over home quar­an­tine for asymp­to­matic cases as hos­pi­tals were deal­ing with a high num­ber of cases.</p>
    <p>Dr Sazaly Abu Bakar, a pro­fes­sor and di­rec­tor of the Trop­i­cal In­fec­tious Dis­eases Re­search and Ed­u­ca­tion Cen­tre at Univer­siti Malaya, said: “Be­fore schools open, they should first do ran­dom sam­plings of chil­dren from dif­fer­ent parts of the coun­try or states to de­ter­mine the com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion rates.</p>
    <p>“If it is very low to low, per­haps then they can al­low re­open­ing, mak­ing sure of full com­pli­ance with the pre­ven­tive mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>Datuk Dr Awang Bulgiba Awang Mah­mud, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist at Univer­siti Malaya, said: “There should be a proper as­sess­ment – where schools and kin­der­gartens can open and where they can­not, and where on­line learn­ing needs to con­tinue.”</p>
    <p>He noted there has been a “lost gen­er­a­tion” this past year in terms of school­ing, and the level of ed­u­ca­tion re­ceived by chil­dren in Malaysia has been un­equal.</p>
    <p>“Some chil­dren have man­aged to re­ceive some on­line in­struc­tion, while there are many oth­ers who have not due to a lack of de­vices and patchy In­ter­net ac­cess, as well as a lack of on­line ma­te­rial suit­able for the na­tional cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps there should be a scheme to loan lap­tops or tablets to school­child­ren who do not have such de­vices and to en­sure that low-in­come fam­i­lies get the In­ter­net sup­port they need,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Harry Tan, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Na­tional Union of the Teach­ing Pro­fes­sion, said par­ents and teach­ers need to work to­gether to help stu­dents keep up with their stud­ies, es­pe­cially those who lack the means to fol­low lessons on­line.</p>
    <p>“They could per­son­ally hand over learn­ing ma­te­ri­als, send recorded videos or even do cor­re­spon­dence learn­ing,” he was quoted as say­ing by The Star yes­ter­day. “Teach­ers are a cre­ative lot, and they adapted pretty quickly as they un­der­stood the need for change.”</p>
    <p>The last time schools re­opened, in June, more than 700 stu­dents con­tracted the virus. Schools were or­dered to close from Oc­to­ber as more dis­tricts were hit by a resur­gence of Covid-19 in­fec­tions, stem­ming from the statewide polls in Sabah in Septem­ber.</p>
