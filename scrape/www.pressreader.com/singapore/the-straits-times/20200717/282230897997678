    <p>The fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor grew by 5 per cent in the first six months of this year – a sil­ver lin­ing amid gloomy eco­nomic pre­dic­tions due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The growth out­paced the same pe­riod last year, ac­cord­ing to es­ti­mates by the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS).</p>
    <p>While MAS ex­pects growth in the sec­tor to slow be­tween June and De­cem­ber due to weaker credit de­mand and lower in­ter­est rate mar­gins, the sec­tor is also un­likely to con­tract.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon made the pre­dic­tion yes­ter­day, at the re­lease of MAS’ an­nual re­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said that growth in the first half of this year was “mainly due to ex­cep­tion­ally strong growth in the first quar­ter, driven by off­shore bank lend­ing, re-in­sur­ance and life in­sur­ance ac­tiv­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>He also noted that employment in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices and fin­tech sec­tors has re­mained firm.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said: “To date, we have not seen an in­crease in re­trench­ments in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices or fin­tech sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“It is en­cour­ag­ing that some ma­jor fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions have com­mit­ted not to shed any work­ers due to the Covid-19 cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Menon warned that “there could po­ten­tially be some net job loss (go­ing into the sec­ond half of the year), but this is not likely to be large”.</p>
    <p>MAS ex­pects the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor to still be a net creator of jobs this year, though not to the ex­tent seen in pre­vi­ous years, Mr</p>
    <p>FIRM EMPLOYMENT IN SEC­TOR</p>
    <p>To date, we have not seen an in­crease in re­trench­ments in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices or fin­tech sec­tors. It is en­cour­ag­ing that some ma­jor fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions have com­mit­ted not to shed any work­ers due to the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>MR RAVI MENON, speak­ing at the re­lease of MAS’ an­nual re­port.</p>
    <p>Menon added.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that there was a net in­crease of about 4,900 jobs in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices and fin­tech sec­tors last year, in­clud­ing fin­tech jobs in the over­all econ­omy but ex­clud­ing jobs in hold­ing com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The employment i ncrease of 6,400 for the fi­nan­cial and in­sur­ance sec­tors in 2019 – pub­lished by MOM – in­cludes hold­ing com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Mr Menon said: “Net jobs grew by 2,200 in the first quar­ter as banks con­tin­ued to em­ploy for roles such as busi­ness de­vel­op­ment, fi­nan­cial anal­y­sis and soft­ware de­vel­op­ment.”</p>
    <p>“If the fi­nan­cial sec­tor stays above zero per cent growth in the sec­ond half of this year, it will achieve the In­dus­try Trans­for­ma­tion Map tar­get of 4.3 per cent an­nual growth in value-added over 2016 to 2020,” Mr Menon said, re­fer­ring to the $4.5 bil­lion pro­gramme un­der which road maps have been de­vel­oped to en­cour­age tech­no­log­i­cal i nno­va­tion among com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“Un­less there are large-scale job losses in the sec­ond half, the fi­nan­cial ser­vices and fin­tech sec­tors will com­fort­ably meet the ITM tar­get of 4,000 jobs per an­num,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a Man­power Group re­port last month, the hir­ing out­look for next quar­ter among Sin­ga­pore em­ploy­ers is the weak­est since 2009.</p>
    <p>Of the 266 firms polled dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, 38 per cent ex­pect head­count to fall in the three months to Sept 30 com­pared with this quar­ter.</p>
