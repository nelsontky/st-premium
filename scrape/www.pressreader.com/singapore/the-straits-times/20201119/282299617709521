    <p>Green loans have been gain­ing pop­u­lar­ity among Sin­ga­pore prop­erty de­vel­op­ers build­ing sus­tain­abil­ity-re­lated prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>The lat­est to use such fa­cil­i­ties is Cap­i­taLand, which has ob­tained its first three green loans in In­dia, to­talling 17 bil­lion rupees (S$307 mil­lion) from DBS Bank In­dia and HSBC In­dia.</p>
    <p>They will fi­nance the de­vel­op­ment of green-cer­ti­fied busi­ness parks in Chennai, Gur­gaon and Pune.</p>
    <p>Two of the three loans came from DBS – a 4.5-year 6.25 bil­lion ru­pee loan to fi­nance the first phase of In­ter­na­tional Tech Park Chennai, Ra­dial Road, and a three-year 4.25 bil­lion ru­pee loan for the first phase of In­ter­na­tional Tech Park Gur­gaon. Both loans were struc­tured in align­ment with the Asia Pa­cific Loan Mar­ket As­so­ci­a­tion’s Green Loan Prin­ci­ples and are the first in In­dia to be is­sued by a Sin­ga­pore­based lender, DBS said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>HSBC has pro­vided a four-year 6.5 bil­lion ru­pee loan to fi­nance the de­vel­op­ment of In­ter­na­tional Tech Park Pune, Kharadi.</p>
    <p>DBS group head of in­sti­tu­tional bank­ing Tan Su Shan said the bank sees “im­mense po­ten­tial” for growth in Asia’s sus­tain­able fi­nanc­ing mar­ket as com­pa­nies look to fur­ther their sus­tain­abil­ity agenda through re­spon­si­ble fi­nanc­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>“In be­com­ing the first Sin­ga­pore bank to fi­nance green loans in In­dia, we are also es­tab­lish­ing Sin­ga­pore as a re­gional sus­tain­able fi­nanc­ing hub,” she said.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand has a port­fo­lio of more than 20 busi­ness and IT parks, in­dus­trial, lodg­ing and lo­gis­tics prop­er­ties across seven In­dian cities – Ban­ga­lore, Chennai, Goa, Gur­gaon, Hy­der­abad, Mum­bai and Pune.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, OCBC Bank has pro­vided a $71 mil­lion re­volv­ing green loan ref­er­enc­ing the Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Av­er­age (Sora) to lo­cal de­vel­oper Tong Eng Group.</p>
    <p>This is Sin­ga­pore’s first green loan ref­er­enc­ing the Sora, OCBC and Tong Eng said yes­ter­day. Pro­ceeds will be used to re­fi­nance Tong Eng Build­ing, which re­ceived the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity (BCA) Green Mark Plat­inum re-cer­ti­fi­ca­tion last month.</p>
    <p>The loan’s in­ter­est rate will be cal­cu­lated based on the three­month com­pounded Sora pub­lished by the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore plus an ap­pli­ca­ble mar­gin.</p>
    <p>Tong Eng will be in­formed on the first day of the loan and then on each rollover of the amount due at the end of an in­ter­est pe­riod.</p>
    <p>OCBC and Tong Eng said this “com­pound­ing in-ad­vance” method pro­vides bet­ter vis­i­bil­ity and there­fore fa­cil­i­tates cash flow plan­ning with re­gard to in­ter­est pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Tong Eng earned the BCA Green Mark Plat­inum Award by in­cor­po­rat­ing sev­eral green fea­tures in Tong Eng Build­ing that re­sulted in en­ergy sav­ings. The de­vel­oper also out­fit­ted all the lifts with new mo­tors, drives and con­trollers to im­prove their ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>Tong Eng man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Teo Tong Lim said: “Be­sides fur­ther­ing our sus­tain­abil­ity strat­egy, this loan is also an im­por­tant step for us in tran­si­tion­ing our loan book to back­ward-look­ing rates – an in­evitable shift that many busi­nesses will have to un­der­take.”</p>
    <p>He added that be­gin­ning this process early has given the com­pany a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the pric­ing of such loans and the op­er­a­tional changes that have to be made to pre­pare for the pe­riod after the ces­sa­tion of the Swap Of­fer Rate.</p>
    <p>Mr Li­nus Goh, OCBC’s head of global com­mer­cial bank­ing, said launch­ing this loan with the re­fi­nanc­ing for Tong Eng Build­ing is a timely re­minder that ma­ture build­ings can meet to­day’s sus­tain­abil­ity stan­dards. The build­ing has been a fix­ture in the Cen­tral Busi­ness District since the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Tong Eng’s green loan is OCBC’s third Sora-based cor­po­rate loan. The first two were ex­tended to Cap­i­taLand in June and to Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries in Oc­to­ber. The lender in­tro­duced the first Sora-based re­tail home loan in July.</p>
    <p>OCBC has ex­tended around $1.3 bil­lion in cor­po­rate and re­tail loans ref­er­enc­ing Sora, in­clud­ing close to $1 bil­lion in Sora-based home loans.</p>
    <p>SUS­TAIN­ABLE FI­NANC­ING HUB</p>
    <p>In be­com­ing the first Sin­ga­pore bank to fi­nance green loans in In­dia, we are also es­tab­lish­ing Sin­ga­pore as a re­gional sus­tain­able fi­nanc­ing hub.</p>
