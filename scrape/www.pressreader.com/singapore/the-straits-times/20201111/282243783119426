    <p>MANILA • The Philip­pines’ eco­nomic con­trac­tion mod­er­ated in the third quar­ter by less than fore­cast, sig­nalling an un­steady re­cov­ery from the pan­demic even as move­ment re­stric­tions were re­laxed and busi­nesses re­opened.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct shrank 11.5 per cent in the three months through Septem­ber from a year ear­lier, an im­prove­ment from the sec­ond quar­ter’s re­vised 16.9 per cent drop. The me­dian fore­cast in a Bloomberg sur­vey was for a 9.6 per cent de­cline.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with the pre­vi­ous quar­ter, the econ­omy ex­panded 8 per cent, be­low the me­dian es­ti­mate of 8.9 per cent among seven econ­o­mists sur­veyed, yes­ter­day’s data showed. The first se­quen­tial growth this year shows the econ­omy is on the mend head­ing into next year, Act­ing Eco­nomic Plan­ning Sec­re­tary Karl Chua said.</p>
    <p>“The eco­nomic team is op­ti­mistic that the worst is over for the coun­try,” said Mr Chua, adding that of­fi­cials would re­assess their eco­nomic pro­jec­tions in the light of the data. “The path is clearer to a stronger bounce­back in 2021.”</p>
    <p>The peso fell 0.2 per cent to 48.25 per US dol­lar as of 11.08am in Manila. The coun­try’s stock bench­mark rose over 3 per cent, join­ing a rally in Asia on vac­cine op­ti­mism.</p>
    <p>The quar­ter-on-quar­ter growth comes af­ter two straight pe­ri­ods of con­trac­tion, in­clud­ing a re­vised 14.9 per cent drop in the sec­ond quar­ter, when the econ­omy en­tered re­ces­sion amid South-east Asia’s sec­ond-worst Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>“While growth is go­ing in the right di­rec­tion, it will take a while un­til pre-pan­demic pro­duc­tion is at­tained,” said Ms Eu­ge­nia Vic­torino, head of Asia strat­egy at Skan­di­naviska En­skilda Banken AB in Sin­ga­pore. “The risk is the longer the re­cov­ery takes, the more per­ma­nent the de­struc­tion of in­comes be­comes. This will cap growth mo­men­tum go­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Con­sumer and busi­ness sen­ti­ment re­main weak af­ter a stricter quar­an­tine was reim­posed in Manila for two weeks in Au­gust. Unem­ploy­ment rose in the cap­i­tal re­gion, which ac­counts for about a third of the econ­omy, even as the na­tion­wide job­less rate eased in July from a record high in April.</p>
    <p>No ma­jor sec­tor per­formed strongly in the third quar­ter, ac­cord­ing to Mr Ni­cholas Mapa, an econ­o­mist at ING Groep NV.</p>
    <p>“More wor­ri­some is the sus­tained weak­ness in cap­i­tal for­ma­tion, which points to fad­ing po­ten­tial out­put and slower growth for quar­ters to come, no mat­ter how much gov­ern­ment pushes to re­open,” he said.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank will likely re­tain its eas­ing mea­sures un­til longterm eco­nomic growth and job tar­gets are reached. So far this year, it has cut its key rate by 175 ba­sis points, eased some lend­ing rules and boosted money sup­ply.</p>
