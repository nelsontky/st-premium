    <p>Sleep has been a ma­jor chal­lenge for Amer­i­can singer Katy Perry since she wel­comed her daugh­ter Daisy Dove, now three months old.</p>
    <p>Perry, 36, opened up about the chal­lenges of be­ing a new mother last Thurs­day in a chat with ac­tor Hugh Jack­man and his wife De­borra-Lee Fur­ness at the David Lynch Foun­da­tion’s Med­i­tate Amer­ica vir­tual ben­e­fit event.</p>
    <p>She said: “My daugh­ter, she’s such a gift, but there is some­times a chal­lenge con­cern­ing sleep, no mat­ter how much sup­port you have.</p>
    <p>“But where am I go­ing to get those six hours that I used to get? Where did it go? And it went, but I know how to get it back.”</p>
    <p>The Grammy Award-win­ning singer wel­comed her first child with her fi­ance, English ac­tor</p>
    <p>Or­lando Bloom, 43, in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>To cope, she has turned to tran­scen­den­tal med­i­ta­tion (TM) to help her find time to take a break dur­ing the day.</p>
    <p>“There’s been so many dif­fer­ent ways TM has blessed me, but in this par­tic­u­lar mo­ment, as a new mother, I take 20 min­utes,” she said, adding that med­i­ta­tion gives her “the deep­est rest”.</p>
    <p>Bloom shared details about their daugh­ter with host Ellen DeGeneres on her show last month, not­ing that the baby re­sem­bles a mix­ture of him­self, his mother and Perry.</p>
    <p>“It was funny be­cause when she came out, I was like, ‘Oh, it’s me! It’s a mini-me’... and then, for­tu­nately, she got those Katy blues, which was per­fect,” said Bloom.</p>
    <p>Perry, who re­turned in Oc­to­ber to work as a judge on the fourth sea­son of Amer­i­can Idol, had much praise for Bloom, who had stepped up his dad du­ties.</p>
    <p>She told En­ter­tain­ment Tonight pre­vi­ously that Bloom has been “do­ing a great job”, adding that “daddy has stepped in”.</p>
