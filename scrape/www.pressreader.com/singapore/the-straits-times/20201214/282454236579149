    <p>NEW YORK • Hedge funds are eye­ing malls, ho­tels and of­fice build­ings hob­bled by the Covid-19 pan­demic in what some say may be the most lu­cra­tive com­mer­cial real es­tate move of next year.</p>
    <p>In­vestors are look­ing to pro­vide loans and in­vest in bonds for re­struc­tured com­mer­cial real es­tate as­sets in trades that could be worth hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine devel­op­ments have buoyed com­mer­cial real es­tate, along with other risk as­sets.</p>
    <p>“The dis­tressed loan pipe­line is build­ing,” said Mr Leo Huang, se­nior port­fo­lio man­ager and head of com­mer­cial real es­tate debt at Elling­ton Man­age­ment Group.</p>
    <p>“This has been a cy­cle that is so sec­tor-spe­cific that we’ve seen good op­por­tu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Com­mer­cial real es­tate and mort­gage-backed se­cu­ri­ties have be­come a credit pick­ers’ mar­ket, bring­ing a wide dis­per­sion in per­for­mance and losses among deals.</p>
    <p>As­set se­lec­tion and credit work in the com­ing year will be key, mar­ket par­tic­i­pants say.</p>
    <p>“For com­mer­cial real es­tate loans and first mort­gages, there’s a need to source and un­der­write them,” Mr Huang said. “It’s messy and frag­mented. We like that busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>He added that his firm will be able to make in­vest­ments into dis­tressed loans next year.</p>
    <p>Elling­ton has been an ac­tive buyer of the riski­est slices of trans­ac­tions, known as B-pieces, which are the first to take losses but po­ten­tially the most lu­cra­tive.</p>
    <p>Arena In­vestors chief ex­ec­u­tive Dan Zwirn said prop­erty val­u­a­tions may gen­er­ally be lower go­ing for­ward, though there will still be nu­mer­ous op­por­tu­ni­ties. As­sets may need to be fit­ted with cap­i­tal struc­tures that make sense for what will now be re­duced val­ues.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been very ac­tive in par­tic­i­pat­ing in the re­struc­tur­ing of com­mer­cial real es­tate as­sets, in terms of hard money lend­ing, bridge fund­ing and buy­ing whole loans off of the banks,” Mr Zwirn said. “We want to be a fi­nancier of the ben­e­fi­cia­ries as much as those in dis­tress.”</p>
    <p>The com­mer­cial mort­gage­backed se­cu­ri­ties mar­ket has strug­gled as Covid-19 kept shop­pers out of malls, trav­ellers away from ho­tels and work­ers home from of­fices.</p>
    <p>But some seg­ments – such as ware­houses and cold stor­age units – have ben­e­fited, and even among trou­bled malls and ho­tels, there are many that will sur­vive and even thrive, mar­ket ob­servers say.</p>
    <p>There­fore, in­vestors are not view­ing the down­turn as black and white, but have a nu­anced out­look that as­sumes cer­tain prop­er­ties will re­cover, de­pend­ing on how well bor­row­ers are cap­i­talised and on a variety of other fac­tors, such as lo­ca­tion and de­mo­graph­ics.</p>
    <p>While re­tail and hos­pi­tal­ity have suf­fered the most, parts of the multi-fam­ily sec­tor may ben­e­fit from the move away from cities, while life sci­ence re­search cen­tres, telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions tow­ers, cold stor­age and in­dus­trial prop­er­ties have seen in­creased busi­ness.</p>
    <p>In terms of val­u­a­tions for trou­bled sec­tors, it is sim­ply a dif­fer­ent world now: There are as­sets that do not have zero value, but sub­stan­tially di­min­ished value.</p>
    <p>“But there’s a non-zero value that makes sense,” Mr Zwirn said.</p>
    <p>While ho­tels may yet re­cover, and ex­perts of­fer vary­ing opin­ions on the re­turn of ur­ban of­fices, weaker re­gional malls, which were trou­bled even be­fore Covid-19, may never come back.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Huang: “Prop­er­ties that are well lo­cated and spon­sors with deep pock­ets might be able to sur­vive or rein­vent them­selves. Other­wise, prop­er­ties may be turned over to the lender as a deed-in-lieu.”</p>
    <p>Mr Zwirn said there is a world of as­sets out there where, iron­i­cally, the vac­cine is a scary thing.</p>
    <p>“The need for a vac­cine could be used as an ex­cuse for short-term poor per­for­mance,” he said. “When that ex­cuse is re­moved, and we see what the new world looks like, it will be bad.”</p>
