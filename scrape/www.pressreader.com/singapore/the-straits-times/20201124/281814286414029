    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia’s two big­gest states re­u­nited i n emo­tional scenes yes­ter­day as the bor­der – shut for only the sec­ond time in 101 years due to the Covid-19 pan­demic – re­opened and the first flights since July landed in Syd­ney from Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>Friends, fam­ily and a mu­si­cal duo in drag wel­comed pas­sen­gers as they dis­em­barked Qan­tas flight QF401 at 7.20am lo­cal time, the first of 26 flights sched­uled be­tween the two states yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I can come and visit my fa­ther when I need to with­out hav­ing to worry about when I can get home,” one pas­sen­ger said.</p>
    <p>The bor­der be­tween New South Wales and Victoria states closed in July due to an out­break of the coro­n­avirus around Mel­bourne – Aus­tralia’s sec­ond-largest city and Victoria’s cap­i­tal. It was the first such bor­der clo­sure since 1919, when Aus­tralia was bat­tling the Span­ish flu.</p>
    <p>The out­break in Victoria, which to­talled more than 20,000 cases, was con­tained only af­ter a strin­gent lock­down last­ing more than 100 days.</p>
    <p>But with Victoria go­ing more than three weeks with­out de­tect­ing any Covid-19 in­fec­tions, the au­thor­i­ties made the de­ci­sion to re­open the bor­der, much to the re­lief of sep­a­rated fam­i­lies and the tourism and avi­a­tion sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“We never want to be in a po­si­tion again when we have to shut down our bor­ders,” New South Wales state Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The Syd­ney-to-Mel­bourne air route is the world’s sec­ond­bus­i­est, and Aus­tralian law­mak­ers are keen to re­vive do­mes­tic travel and tourism in a bid to re­vive the ail­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia also hopes to restart in­ter­na­tional travel, with flights to New Zealand in the works.</p>
    <p>While New Zealand cit­i­zens can now travel to Victoria with­out hav­ing to go through quar­an­tine, a re­cip­ro­cal agree­ment is still some way off. New Zealand says vis­i­tors from Aus­tralia will re­main barred un­til the en­tire coun­try has gone at least 28 days with­out a sin­gle Covid-19 case.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s econ­omy shrank 7 per cent in the three months that ended in June, the most since records be­gan in 1959, while the un­em­ploy­ment rate hit a 22-year high of 7.5 per cent in July.</p>
    <p>Be­sides re­open­ing its bor­der with Victoria, New South Wales said that up to 500 people can now gather at out­door re­li­gious gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>And on Sun­day, Victoria an­nounced the eas­ing of var­i­ous curbs. “Three months ago, Victoria had 4,293 ac­tive cases. To­day, we have one,” state Premier Daniel An­drews said.</p>
    <p>Victoria ac­counts for about 73 per cent of Aus­tralia’s to­tal Covid-19 cases of just over 27,800 and 90 per cent of its 907 deaths.</p>
