    <p>• Lionel Messi must stay at Barcelona so he can lead the team for the re­main­der of his ca­reer and play a strate­gic role when he re­tires, ac­cord­ing to the club’s lead­ing pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Vic­tor Font.</p>
    <p>The six-time World Player of the Year and their all-time top scorer came close to leav­ing the Cata­lan gi­ants in Au­gust after his re­la­tion­ship with then pres­i­dent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu turned sour.</p>
    <p>Messi con­ceded de­feat in his at­tempt to leave the Nou Camp dur­ing the trans­fer win­dow after Barca stuck to their guns.</p>
    <p>But the Ar­gentina cap­tain can still leave the club, where he has spent his en­tire ca­reer, for free at the end of this sea­son un­less he pens a new con­tract be­fore the end of June.</p>
    <p>Font, who formed part of a cam­paign against Bar­tomeu which led to him re­sign­ing last month, is the front run­ner to win the Jan 24 elec­tion and be­lieves the world’s best­paid player can still be con­vinced to com­mit his fu­ture to the team.</p>
    <p>“When you are lucky enough to have the best player in the world in your team, you need to re­tain that tal­ent,” he told Reuters in an in­ter</p>
    <p>view on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“If Messi goes to a com­peti­tor, we will not find an al­ter­na­tive eas­ily as there is no al­ter­na­tive to Messi. So that’s why re­tain­ing him in the short term is crit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>“But for us, the as­so­ci­a­tion be­tween Messi and Barca is a strate­gic re­la­tion­ship and we want to make sure we cre­ate the right con­di­tions for Messi to play a role in the</p>
    <p>club, even after he re­tires. Messi could con­trib­ute plenty of ideas.”</p>
    <p>The telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions en­tre­pre­neur has been plan­ning a run at the pres­i­dency for seven years and has cho­sen Barca great Xavi Her­nan­dez to lead the team as a gen­eral man­ager in the long term as well as tak­ing over Ron­ald Koe­man as coach.</p>
    <p>Get­ting his for­mer team­mate on board is part of Font’s strat­egy to en­sure the club skip­per re­mains.</p>
    <p>“Messi needs to be con­vinced we have a com­pet­i­tive and win­ning project and Xavi can play a de­ci­sive role in us do­ing that,” said the 48-year-old. “Xavi’s cred­i­bil­ity and know-how about foot­ball is the right one to con­vince some­one like Messi.</p>
    <p>“They are friends, they know each other, they trust each other and that’s go­ing to be key.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, spec­u­la­tion re­mains rife that the 33-year-old Messi wants a new ad­ven­ture, with Manch­ester City said to be among his suit­ors.</p>
    <p>La Liga pres­i­dent Javier Te­bas has never hid­den his dis­taste for the Abu Dhabi-owned English Premier League club, hav­ing re­peat­edly crit­i­cised the way they are run over the years.</p>
    <p>“We would pre­fer Messi to stay in La Liga but (Cris­tiano) Ron­aldo and Ney­mar left, and we have not no­ticed any dif­fer­ence. We are ready,” he said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“It seems the only club in the Premier League that talks about reg­is­ter­ing Messi is Manch­ester City, who com­pete out­side the rules.”</p>
