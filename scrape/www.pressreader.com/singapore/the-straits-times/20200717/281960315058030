    <p>On July 10, the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) won 83 out of 93 seats and se­cured 61.2 per cent of the pop­u­lar vote in the 2020 Gen­eral Elec­tion. In any democ­racy, such an out­come would be re­garded as out­stand­ing. It is im­por­tant to re­mind our­selves that Sin­ga­pore is a democ­racy and not some other form of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>EX­TER­NAL VIEW</p>
    <p>I am quite shocked by the com­ments of some for­eign ob­servers. Pro­fes­sor Michael Barr from Flin­ders Univer­sity in Aus­tralia de­scribed the re­sult as a “disas­ter” for the PAP. Pro­fes­sor Brid­get Welsh from the Univer­sity of Not­ting­ham Malaysia and Na­tional Tai­wan Univer­sity de­scribed the out­come as a “hu­mil­i­at­ing de­feat” for the PAP. Are these fair as­sess­ments?</p>
    <p>Let’s com­pare the PAP’s elec­toral per­for­mance to those of the win­ning par­ties in Aus­tralia, the United King­dom and In­dia.</p>
    <p>In the 2019 Aus­tralian fed­eral elec­tion, Prime Min­is­ter Scott Morrison’s coali­tion won 77 out of 151 seats and se­cured 41 per cent of the pop­u­lar vote.</p>
    <p>In the 2019 gen­eral elec­tion in the UK, the Con­ser­va­tive Party won 365 out of 650 seats and se­cured 43.6 per cent of the pop­u­lar vote.</p>
    <p>In the 2019 In­dian gen­eral elec­tion, the Bharatiya Janata Party won 303 out of 542 seats and 37 per cent of the pop­u­lar vote.</p>
    <p>VIC­TORY FOR PAP AND WP</p>
    <p>When we com­pare the PAP’s elec­toral per­for­mance to those of the win­ning par­ties in these three coun­tries, any fair-minded per­son would con­clude that it was an out­stand­ing vic­tory. It was cer­tainly not a “disas­ter” or a “hu­mil­i­at­ing de­feat”.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the out­come of the elec­tion was a vic­tory for the Work­ers’ Party (WP). There was a doubt, be­fore the elec­tion, whether it would be able to re­tain its seat in Hougang SMC and its five seats in Alju­nied GRC. WP not only re­tained those six seats, and with in­creased ma­jori­ties, but it also won a four-mem­ber group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency, Sengkang, de­feat­ing three PAP of­fice-hold­ers on the op­pos­ing slate.</p>
    <p>LEADER OF THE OP­PO­SI­TION</p>
    <p>I ap­plaud Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s de­ci­sion to ap­point WP chief Pri­tam Singh as the of­fi­cial Leader of the Op­po­si­tion. As</p>
    <p>Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, Mr Singh will be given staff sup­port and re­sources to carry out his re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, PM Lee has said, al­though it is not clear what level of sup­port he will be given and whether he will be paid a salary. In Bri­tain, the leader of the op­po­si­tion draws a salary equiv­a­lent to that of a Cab­i­net min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>By ap­point­ing Mr Singh as the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, PM Lee is ac­knowl­edg­ing that the WP is here to stay and is likely to grow stronger in the com­ing years.</p>
    <p>I agree with Straits Times</p>
    <p>Opin­ion editor Chua Mui Hoong’s com­ment that we may be see­ing the emer­gence of a two-party state in Sin­ga­pore. (July 11, “A re­sult that could please vot­ers from both sides”.) She wrote that the elec­tion re­sult showed that “a two-party sys­tem in its in­fancy is tak­ing shape, as the WP now has the clout to at­tract good can­di­dates, run a good cam­paign and put up al­ter­na­tive pol­icy pro­pos­als. It will be tested in town coun­cil and con­stituency man­age­ment next”.</p>
    <p>I also agree with Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs chair­man Si­mon Tay’s com­ment that the cor­rect re­ply to the question of who won the elec­tion is that Sin­ga­pore won the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>On his Face­book page, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Tay posted: “If Sin­ga­pore­ans want to sig­nal that we have con­cerns but are not pan­icked, that we have trust in a PAP gov­ern­ment but not blind faith, and that we will want di­verse per­spec­tives and voices of hope to be heard, even as we lis­ten to our lead­ers in re­spond­ing to this cri­sis, our mes­sage was sent.</p>
    <p>“Who won the 2020 Gen­eral Elec­tion? Sin­ga­pore won.”</p>
    <p>TIM­ING OF THE ELEC­TION</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is in the midst of two crises: a health cri­sis and an eco­nomic cri­sis. The con­ven­tional wis­dom is that an elec­tion dur­ing a cri­sis will ben­e­fit the in­cum­bent. Why didn’t the PAP ben­e­fit more from the cri­sis?</p>
    <p>I think the rea­son is that many vot­ers felt that hold­ing the elec­tion in the midst of the Covid-19 pan­demic was too op­por­tunis­tic. Many doc­tors had feared that it could lead to a sec­ond surge of the virus out­break.</p>
    <p>TAKE THE HIGH ROAD</p>
    <p>I think the elec­torate was send­ing sev­eral mes­sages to the po­lit­i­cal par­ties. One mes­sage was to urge the par­ties to take the high road and not the low road.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond mes­sage was for them to fo­cus on the is­sues in­stead of at­tack­ing their op­po­nents. Char­ac­ter as­sas­si­na­tion is frowned upon by the elec­torate.</p>
    <p>For this rea­son, the fol­low­ing at­tacks were not well re­ceived:</p>
    <p>• An at­tempt to use lo­cal play­wright Al­fian Sa’at as a stick to beat Mr Singh.</p>
    <p>• An at­tack on Ms Raeesah Khan, a young WP can­di­date for Sengkang GRC, for her so­cial me­dia posts on race is­sues.</p>
    <p>• An at­tempt to brand Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party (SDP) chief and Bukit Ba­tok SMC can­di­date Chee Soon Juan as a liar.</p>
    <p>• The use of Pofma (Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act) over state­ments made by SDP chair­man and Bukit Pan­jang SMC can­di­date Paul Tam­byah.</p>
    <p>IN­TER­NET ELEC­TION</p>
    <p>This is Sin­ga­pore’s first In­ter­net elec­tion. Be­cause of Covid-19, phys­i­cal ral­lies were not pos­si­ble. Po­lit­i­cal par­ties con­cen­trated their ac­tiv­i­ties on home vis­its, meet­ing vot­ers at hawker cen­tres, and cam­paign­ing on­line via e-ral­lies and vir­tual talk shows.</p>
    <p>My im­pres­sion is that all the par­ties did a good job us­ing the In­ter­net to con­nect with vot­ers and to dis­sem­i­nate their mes­sages. The PAP and WP were par­tic­u­larly ef­fec­tive in this re­spect.</p>
    <p>WOMEN POWER</p>
    <p>A won­der­ful as­pect of the 2020 elec­tion was the large num­ber of women can­di­dates – 39 in all.</p>
    <p>It is also sig­nif­i­cant that the PAP women can­di­dates in sin­gle-mem­ber con­stituen­cies, such as Dr Amy Khor, Ms Tin Pei Ling, Ms Sun Xuel­ing and Ms Grace Fu, won their seats by large ma­jori­ties.</p>
    <p>I am very pleased to see more women join­ing pol­i­tics and en­ter­ing Par­lia­ment. We need more women in Par­lia­ment and in the Cab­i­net. My dream is that one day, Sin­ga­pore will have a woman prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>SENGKANG GRC</p>
    <p>WP’s vic­tory in Sengkang GRC was a big sur­prise. It brings back mem­o­ries of the loss of Alju­nied GRC by the PAP to the WP in 2011.</p>
    <p>How did the young WP team of Ms He Ting Ru, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor</p>
    <p>Ja­mus Lim, Mr Louis Chua and Ms Raeesah suc­ceed in de­feat­ing the older PAP team, which in­cluded three of­fice-hold­ers – Mr Ng Chee Meng, Dr Lam Pin Min and Mr Am­rin Amin?</p>
    <p>Mr Ng as labour chief was a Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice, Dr Lam was Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health and Trans­port, and Mr Am­rin was Se­nior Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Home Af­fairs and Health.</p>
    <p>I don’t know the an­swer. Some ex­perts think that it was due to the spe­cial char­ac­ter of the con­stituency, with its higher per­cent­age of younger vot­ers, and to the star power of the WP can­di­date, Prof Lim. Oth­ers think the PAP’s strong crit­i­cism of Ms Raeesah swung young vot­ers over in a sym­pa­thy vote.</p>
    <p>Sengkang GRC is a new con­stituency carved out of pre­vi­ous wards. Most of its vot­ers live in Hous­ing Board flats and it is a con­stituency with many young vot­ers and young fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Do young vot­ers have a dif­fer­ent world view and as­pi­ra­tions than older vot­ers?</p>
    <p>I think the an­swer is yes. Young vot­ers want the Gov­ern­ment to be more con­sul­ta­tive and less pa­ter­nal­is­tic. They are more lib­eral and ac­cept­ing of al­ter­na­tive views and life­styles. They are less race-con­scious and do not agree that Sin­ga­pore is not ready for a non-Chi­nese prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Young vot­ers are also more so­cially con­scious and want to see a rad­i­cal re­duc­tion of poverty and in­equal­ity. They want a fairer Sin­ga­pore. They are more en­vi­ron­men­tally con­scious and want Sin­ga­pore to grow greener.</p>
    <p>They have sent sev­eral mes­sages to the PAP Gov­ern­ment with the vote and I sin­cerely hope the PAP is hear­ing them. I hope the Gov­ern­ment will con­sider them with an open mind and not brush them aside.</p>
    <p>In con­clu­sion, two things bear re­peat­ing.</p>
    <p>First, the out­come of the 2020 elec­tion was a vic­tory for the PAP. It was not a disas­ter or a hu­mil­i­at­ing de­feat.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the WP has made a ma­jor break­through by re­tain­ing Hougang SMC and Alju­nied GRC, and win­ning Sengkang GRC. It is now recog­nised as a cred­i­ble op­po­si­tion, and Sin­ga­pore­ans will ex­pect it to op­pose the</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment in ar­eas where it dis­agrees but al­ways be loyal to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
