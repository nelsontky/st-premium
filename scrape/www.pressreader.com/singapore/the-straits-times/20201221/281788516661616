    <p>Since early this month, six re­tail­ers have pulled prod­ucts by Fu Wan Choco­late from their shelves and stopped col­lab­o­ra­tions with the Tai­wanese choco­late com­pany, af­ter an uniden­ti­fied In­ter­net user posted on­line de­tails of a five-yearold sex­ual ha­rass­ment case in­volv­ing the com­pany’s for­mer chair­man and an in­tern.</p>
    <p>The in­tern, who worked at Fu Wan in 2015, had ac­cused then chair­man Hsu Feng-chia of sex­u­ally ha­rass­ing her at work, re­sult­ing in Mr Hsu be­ing handed a six­month jail sen­tence – which was later com­muted to a fine. He was also re­moved from his po­si­tion the same year.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­net user posted de­tails of the crime last month on Tai­wan’s Dcard fo­rum, the lo­cal equiv­a­lent of Red­dit, which prompted many con­sumers to stop buy­ing Fu Wan prod­ucts. Sev­eral food man­u­fac­tur­ers also cut off col­lab­o­ra­tions with the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Based in south­ern Tai­wan, Fu Wan Choco­late is known for its lo­cally pro­duced choco­lates that have won awards in many in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>Within a week of the Dcard post, the con­sumer back­lash caused ma­jor food man­u­fac­tur­ers Lau­rel</p>
    <p>Corp and Kuai Kuai to re­call prod­ucts they each made us­ing Fu Wan choco­late. They also an­nounced that they would do­nate pro­ceeds from pre­vi­ous sales of these prod­ucts to char­ity.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese dough­nut chain Mis­ter Donut also stopped sell­ing prod­ucts con­tain­ing Fu Wan choco­late, and French hy­per­mar­ket chain Car­refour re­moved all of Fu Wan’s choco­late bars from its stores in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>But law­mak­ers and gen­der equal­ity ex­perts think more can be done. Ms Fan Yun, a rul­ing Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party law­maker, led a press con­fer­ence on Dec 10 call­ing for the Labour Min­istry to amend gen­der equal­ity laws to give em­ploy­ees more pro­tec­tion in cases of sex­ual ha­rass­ment at work.</p>
    <p>Ms Fan and fel­low law­maker Hung Sun-han said Tai­wan’s cur­rent Gen­der Equal­ity in Em­ploy­ment Act dis­cour­ages vic­tims of sex­ual ha­rass­ment from fil­ing com­plaints if the per­pe­tra­tor is their em­ployer, as the law re­quires com­pa­nies to in­ves­ti­gate com­plaints them­selves be­fore fur­ther ac­tion is taken.</p>
    <p>Mr Cho Keng-yu, who is on the board of the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry’s Gen­der Equity Ed­u­ca­tion Com­mit­tee, noted that a com­pany in­ves­ti­ga­tion would have a muz­zling ef­fect. “In the ma­jor­ity of Tai­wan’s work­place sex­ual ha­rass­ment cases, vic­tims are re­luc­tant to speak out as they fear los­ing their jobs,” said Mr Cho, who has also pro­vided coun­selling for em­ploy­ers ac­cused of mo­lest­ing their em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>To rem­edy the sit­u­a­tion, law­mak­ers are propos­ing an amend­ment that would in­stead al­low vic­tims to ap­proach the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties if their em­ployer or su­per­vi­sor is the per­pe­tra­tor.</p>
    <p>Ms Huang Yi-ling, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Tai­wan Oc­cu­pa­tional Safety and Health Link, echoed Mr Cho’s views.</p>
    <p>“The law asks the com­pa­nies to come up with a so­lu­tion with the vic­tims. A case is brought to the au­thor­i­ties’ at­ten­tion and recorded in the gov­ern­ment’s data only when it doesn’t get re­solved within the com­pany,” noted Ms Huang.</p>
    <p>This means that gov­ern­ment data on sex­ual ha­rass­ment cases is not ac­cu­rate, and may not re­flect an in­creas­ing num­ber of vic­tims in Tai­wan tak­ing ac­tion against their ha­rassers as the #MeToo move­ment spreads in Asia.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ms Fan, Fu Wan Choco­late is the first com­pany in Tai­wan to face a boy­cott of its prod­ucts ow­ing to sex­ual ha­rass­ment within the com­pany.</p>
    <p>But while the boy­cott ac­tion has gained trac­tion, Ms Huang said the pub­lic for­gets such is­sues quickly.</p>
    <p>She said there should be mon­i­tor­ing of a com­pany’s cul­ture to en­sure the work en­vi­ron­ment is safe for em­ploy­ees.</p>
