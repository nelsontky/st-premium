    <p>The twice-de­layed high-speed rail (HSR) project be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia will no longer go ahead, af­ter both coun­tries were un­able to reach an agree­ment on changes pro­posed by Malaysia. The ter­mi­na­tion of the agree­ment came amid re­cent ru­mours that Malaysia has de­cided to build the line alone.</p>
    <p>The twice-de­layed high-speed rail (HSR) project be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia will no longer go ahead, af­ter both coun­tries were un­able to reach an agree­ment on changes pro­posed by Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The ter­mi­na­tion of the agree­ment was an­nounced by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian coun­ter­part, Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin, yes­ter­day, and came amid re­cent ru­mours that Malaysia had de­cided to build the line alone.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­a­tions hit an im­passe af­ter Malaysia pro­posed changes due to the eco­nomic im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In their joint state­ment, the prime min­is­ters, who had spo­ken via video­con­fer­ence on Dec 2, said: “Both gov­ern­ments had con­ducted sev­eral dis­cus­sions with re­gard to these changes and had not been able to reach an agree­ment. There­fore, the HSR agree­ment had lapsed on Dec 31.”</p>
    <p>Malaysian Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Depart­ment Mustapa Mo­hamed said yes­ter­day that his govern­ment had wanted to bring for­ward the con­struc­tion phase and also pro­posed a new project struc­ture which would have pro­vided more fi­nanc­ing op­tions.</p>
    <p>He added that Malaysia will hon­our its obli­ga­tions and both coun­tries will ini­ti­ate the nec­es­sary pro­ce­dures to de­ter­mine the amount of com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>PM Lee and Mr Muhyid­din also said: “Both coun­tries re­main com­mit­ted to main­tain good bi­lat­eral re­la­tions, and co­op­er­ate closely in var­i­ous fields, in­clud­ing strength­en­ing the con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween the two coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>The writ­ing was on the wall af­ter Malaysian news re­ports in re­cent months sug­gested that the Malaysian Cabi­net was plan­ning to con­tinue on its own and end the line in Johor in­stead of Jurong.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s state­ments did not de­tail the com­pen­sa­tion amount that Malaysia has to pay Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Trans­port Min­istry said that as Malaysia al­lowed the agree­ment to lapse, it will have to com­pen­sate Sin­ga­pore for costs al­ready in­curred.</p>
    <p>Based on ear­lier es­ti­mates, Sin­ga­pore had al­ready spent more than $250 mil­lion for de­sign, man­power and land ac­qui­si­tions by the end of May 2018, then Trans­port Min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan told Par­lia­ment in July that year.</p>
    <p>He also said Sin­ga­pore would con­tinue to in­cur costs – over $6 mil­lion each month in June and July, and at least $40 mil­lion from August to the end of 2018.</p>
    <p>When Sin­ga­pore agreed to Malaysia’s re­quest for a sus­pen­sion in August that year, more costs were in­curred to com­pen­sate con­trac­tors for break­ing con­tracts, and to fill back sites al­ready ex­ca­vated, for in­stance. Malaysia had agreed to re­im­burse Sin­ga­pore $15 mil­lion for these abortive costs.</p>
    <p>The 350km rail line, which Malaysia mooted and both sides agreed to build in 2013, was to have run from Ban­dar Malaysia in down­town Kuala Lumpur to Jurong East.</p>
    <p>It would have had seven sta­tions, and would have cut travel time be­tween Kuala Lumpur and Sin­ga­pore, one of the busiest air routes.</p>
    <p>The trip would have taken 90 min­utes on the HSR, com­pared with over four hours by car and about five hours end to end by air.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore com­menced work on the project, ap­point­ing a firm to de­sign in­fra­struc­ture and call­ing an in­ter­na­tional j oint ten­der with Malaysia for an as­sets com­pany, af­ter both coun­tries signed a legally­bind­ing bi­lat­eral agree­ment in De­cem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>The project was put on hold fol­low­ing a change in the Malaysian govern­ment in May 2018. The twoyear sus­pen­sion was set to ex­pire in May last year and ex­tended for a se­cond and fi­nal time till Dec 31.</p>
    <p>The lat­est de­vel­op­ment has come un­der crit­i­cism by some in Malaysia, among them f ormer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak, who said yes­ter­day that a do­mes­tic line was not eco­nom­i­cally vi­able.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, ob­servers do not ex­pect a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on bi­lat­eral ties, say­ing that the joint state­ment in­di­cates a mu­tual agree­ment was reached on the ter­mi­na­tion.</p>
