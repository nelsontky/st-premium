    <p>NEW YORK • Anx­i­ety sweat. Horse-hair. Wet grass and soil af­ter rain. Sul­phuric com­pounds from gun­pow­der. Eau de cologne con­tain­ing rose­mary, berg­amot and bit­ter orange. A touch of leather.</p>
    <p>This might have been what Napoleon’s re­treat from the Bat­tle of Water­loo in 1815 smelled like.</p>
    <p>At least, these are some of the el­e­ments Ms Caro Ver­beek, an art his­to­rian and ol­fac­tory re­searcher, tried to in­cor­po­rate when she was re­con­struct­ing the smell, in part­ner­ship with per­fumer Bir­git Si­jbrands, scent de­signer Bernardo Flem­ing of In­ter­na­tional Fla­vors & Fra­grances and the Ri­jksmu­seum in Am­s­ter­dam.</p>
    <p>“Wars are ex­tremely smelly. Sol­diers don’t write about in­juries as much as they write about the ter­ri­ble sounds and smells, so we know more about them,” she said.</p>
    <p>They also knew it had rained the night be­fore the bat­tle, that anx­i­ety sweat smells dif­fer­ent from nor­mal sweat, and that there were thou­sands of horses on the field. And they were aware of the in­gre­di­ents of Napoleon’s per­fume – he wore litres of it ev­ery day and car­ried a bot­tle in his boot.</p>
    <p>These were some details Ms Ver­beek re­lied on for the re­con­struc­tion, as part of a pro­ject called In Search Of Lost Scents. The scent is of­fered in the Ri­jksmu­seum as part of tours – on strips of pa­per or in a neck­lace with tiny pumps – along­side Jan Willem Piene­man’s 1824 paint­ing of the scene.</p>
    <p>In the grow­ing field of smell re­search, sci­en­tists, artists, his­to­ri­ans and cul­tural her­itage spe­cial­ists are com­ing to­gether to work on what is per­haps the trick­i­est sense to pre­serve.</p>
    <p>Some are work­ing on try­ing to con­serve the smells of the times.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, like Ms Ver­beek, are work­ing on re­con­struct­ing some of the lost scents.</p>
    <p>These are some of the ar­eas that Odeu­ropa, a re­search con­sor­tium on ol­fac­tory her­itage that was awarded a €2.8 mil­lion (S$4.5 mil­lion) grant, is fo­cused on study­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Inger Lee­mans, a cul­tural her­itage pro­fes­sor and pro­ject leader of Odeu­ropa, said: “We’re also ask­ing, what are the fra­grant places of our coun­tries or Europe?”</p>
    <p>She added: “We’re los­ing them fast be­cause time never stops, but is it valid to try to safe­guard those places or re­con­struct them? How do you bring the past to the nose?”</p>
    <p>His­tory is rife with smells peo­ple will never be able to re­claim.</p>
    <p>De­spite the de­tailed ef­forts of Ms Ver­beek, they will never re­ally know what the Bat­tle of Water­loo smelled like. They may not even be able to re­cap­ture the smells of their child­hoods.</p>
    <p>Many scents that are van­ish­ing in­clude moth­balls, burn­ing piles of leaves in au­tumn and typewriter rib­bons.</p>
    <p>Although tech­nol­ogy has made it eas­ier to iso­late the chem­i­cal com­pounds of a smell, odours are also highly con­text de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>But pre­serv­ing smell re­quires more than just ol­fac­tory data.</p>
    <p>Ms Ce­cilia Bem­bibre, a re­searcher at the In­sti­tute for Sus­tain­able Her­itage at Univer­sity Col­lege London, is work­ing on a sys­tem­atic means of ar­chiv­ing smell, us­ing chem­istry and qual­i­ta­tive tools. She has done this for the smell of old books.</p>
    <p>The field of scent re­search is gain­ing recog­ni­tion, but smell has long been less stud­ied than the other senses. “It’s gain­ing ground, but it’s a bit of an odd­ity,” she said.</p>
