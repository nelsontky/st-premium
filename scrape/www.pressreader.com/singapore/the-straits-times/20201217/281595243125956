    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong will be on lo­cal leave for two weeks from today, his of­fice said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>No act­ing prime min­is­ter will be ap­pointed dur­ing this pe­riod as he will re­main con­tactable.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to me­dia queries, PM Lee’s press sec­re­tary, Ms Chang Li Lin, clar­i­fied that Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat would also be on lo­cal leave on some days while PM Lee is on leave.</p>
    <p>PM Lee de­cided he could con­tinue, since he was not trav­el­ling and would re­main con­tactable, rather than switch­ing be­tween him­self and Mr Heng as act­ing prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng will chair the Cabi­net meet­ings dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day night, PM Lee said: “No trav­el­ling over­seas this year. In­stead, I will be ex­plor­ing our is­land and catch­ing up on my read­ing.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee added that he will up­date his so­cial me­dia fol­low­ers if he came across any­thing in­ter­est­ing dur­ing his walks.</p>
    <p>The last time the Prime Min­is­ter went on leave in De­cem­ber last year, Mr Heng was the act­ing prime min­is­ter from Dec 25 un­til the end of PM Lee’s leave on Jan 3 this year.</p>
    <p>This was be­fore the first con­firmed case of Covid-19 was an­nounced in Sin­ga­pore on Jan 23.</p>
