    <p>A les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual and trans­gen­der (LGBT) rights ac­tivist has ap­plied to the High Court for a manda­tory or­der for Cab­i­net to move a Bill in Par­lia­ment to abol­ish the law that crim­i­nalises sex be­tween men.</p>
    <p>In an­other at­tempt to re­peal Sec­tion 377A of the Pe­nal Code, Dr Roy Tan Seng Kee, 62, ar­gued that the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s po­si­tion on the non-en­force­ment of Sec­tion 377A ren­ders the law otiose, mean­ing it is use­less and serves no prac­ti­cal pur­pose.</p>
    <p>The re­tired gen­eral prac­ti­tioner said in a state­ment on Thurs­day that Sec­tion 377A had be­come a “dead let­ter” – an ob­so­lete law that has out­lived its rel­e­vance – and its re­ten­tion is un­law­ful, given the Gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion not to en­force it.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Supreme Court of Ju­di­ca­ture Act, the High Court can is­sue “any per­son or au­thor­ity any di­rec­tion, or­der or writ for the en­force­ment of any right con­ferred by any writ­ten law or for any other pur­pose”.</p>
    <p>In ap­ply­ing for a manda­tory or­der, ap­pli­cants can also ask the court to make a dec­la­ra­tion, or a state­ment of the court’s au­thor­i­ta­tive opin­ion on a mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments filed by lawyer M. Ravi, Dr Tan is also seek­ing a dec­la­ra­tion that Sec­tion 377A is in­con­gru­ous and in­con­sis­tent with var­i­ous other laws.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan had filed a con­sti­tu­tional chal­lenge against Sec­tion 377A last year, ar­gu­ing, among other things, that the Gov­ern­ment’s stance on not en­forc­ing Sec­tion 377A was in­com­pat­i­ble with Sec­tions 17 and 424 of the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code.</p>
    <p>Sec­tion 17 re­quires the po­lice to un­con­di­tion­ally in­ves­ti­gate all com­plaints of sus­pected ar­restable of­fences, while Sec­tion 424 makes it com­pul­sory for any­one who is aware of any pos­si­ble com­mis­sion of a crime to in­form the po­lice of it.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice See Kee Oon dis­missed Dr</p>
    <p>Tan’s case in March this year, along with two other cases filed in 2018.</p>
    <p>In a judg­ment re­leased in March, Jus­tice See said some of Dr Tan’s ar­gu­ments had taken is­sue with the en­force­ment of the law, not its con­sti­tu­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>He noted that these is­sues were sep­a­rate and dis­tinct, and that the man­ner in which a pro­vi­sion was en­forced, even if ar­bi­trary, could not in it­self ren­der the pro­vi­sion un­con­sti­tu­tional.</p>
    <p>“The ap­pro­pri­ate re­course i n such a sit­u­a­tion would be to seek ad­min­is­tra­tive re­view, not con­sti­tu­tional re­view,” the judge said.</p>
    <p>The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, the re­spon­dent in all three pre­vi­ous chal­lenges, had ar­gued that the ques­tion of whether to re­peal Sec­tion 377A is a “deeply di­vi­sive so­cio-po­lit­i­cal is­sue” which should be de­cided by Par­lia­ment, not the ju­di­ciary.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan is now hop­ing to have the mat­ter con­sid­ered in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He noted that Sec­tion 9A (1) of the In­ter­pre­ta­tion Act re­quires the courts to in­ter­pret a writ­ten law in a way that pro­motes the pur­pose or ob­ject un­der­ly­ing that law.</p>
    <p>“Par­lia­ment’s un­der­tak­ing not to proac­tively en­force Sec­tion 377A ren­ders the courts un­able to per­form their le­gal obli­ga­tion,” Dr Tan said. He added that he will draw on re­cent prece­dents in Bri­tish com­mon law to sup­port his case.</p>
