    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The chief ex­ec­u­tives of four of the world’s largest tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies – Ama­zon, Face­book, Ap­ple and Al­pha­bet’s Google – were set to ar­gue in a con­gres­sional hear­ing on an­titrust that they face in­tense com­pe­ti­tion from one an­other and from other ri­vals.</p>
    <p>The tes­ti­mony from Ama­zon’s Mr Jeff Be­zos, Face­book’s Mr Mark Zucker­berg, Google’s Mr Sun­dar Pichai and Ap­ple’s Mr Tim Cook, which was re­leased on Tues­day, por­trayed four chief ex­ec­u­tives who are look­ing over their shoul­ders at com­peti­tors who could ren­der them ob­so­lete.</p>
    <p>Mr Pichai ar­gued that search – which Google dom­i­nates by most met­rics – was broader than just typ­ing a query into Google, and said he re­mained con­cerned about be­ing rel­e­vant as peo­ple turn to Twit­ter, Pin­ter­est or other web­sites for in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“We know Google’s con­tin­ued suc­cess is not guar­an­teed. Google op­er­ates in highly com­pet­i­tive and dy­namic global mar­kets, in which prices are free or fall­ing, and prod­ucts are con­stantly im­prov­ing,” he said, in the pre­pared re­marks.</p>
    <p>The four were to tes­tify yes­ter­day to a panel of law­mak­ers in­ves­ti­gat­ing how their busi­ness prac­tices and data gath­er­ing have hurt smaller ri­vals as they seek to re­tain their dom­i­nance, or ex­pand.</p>
    <p>In his re­marks, Mr Be­zos said Ama­zon oc­cu­pies a small share of the over­all re­tail mar­ket and com­petes with re­tail­ers like Wal­mart, which is twice its size.</p>
    <p>He also said the coron­avirus pan­demic has boosted e-com­merce busi­nesses across the spec­trum and not just Ama­zon.</p>
    <p>Mr Be­zos also laid out how small sell­ers have suc­ceeded on Ama­zon’s third-party mar­ket­place, a prac­tice that has come un­der scru­tiny from law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>In his pre­pared tes­ti­mony, Mr Zucker­berg ar­gued that Face­book com­petes against other com­pa­nies ap­pear­ing at the hear­ing and against oth­ers glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Mr Zucker­berg was also to de­fend Face­book’s ac­qui­si­tions by say­ing the so­cial me­dia plat­form helped com­pa­nies such as What­sApp and Instagram grow. Both are owned by Face­book.</p>
    <p>He was also to re­mind law­mak­ers of the com­pet­i­tive threat which US tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies face from China, say­ing China is build­ing its “own ver­sion of the In­ter­net fo­cused on very dif­fer­ent ideas, and they are ex­port­ing their vi­sion to other coun­tries”.</p>
    <p>Mr Zucker­berg also re­newed Face­book’s call for gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>He has pre­vi­ously called for more laws in ar­eas where the com­pany has been crit­i­cised – such as harm­ful con­tent in so­cial me­dia, elec­tion in­tegrity and pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple’s Mr Cook was to tell the com­mit­tee that the com­pany “does not have a dom­i­nant mar­ket share in any mar­ket where we do busi­ness” and “that is not just true for iPhone, it is true for any prod­uct cat­e­gory”.</p>
    <p>He was to ar­gue that the com­pany’s “com­mis­sions are com­pa­ra­ble to or lower than com­mis­sions charged by the ma­jor­ity of our com­peti­tors”, and “they are vastly lower than the 50 per cent to 70 per cent that soft­ware de­vel­op­ers paid to dis­trib­ute their work be­fore we launched the App Store”.</p>
    <p>The four were to tes­tify yes­ter­day to a panel of law­mak­ers in­ves­ti­gat­ing how their busi­ness prac­tices and data gath­er­ing have hurt smaller ri­vals as they seek to re­tain their dom­i­nance, or ex­pand.</p>
