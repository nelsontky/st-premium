    <p>Park con­nec­tors are my new­found ob­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>They weave through un­fa­mil­iar res­i­den­tial es­tates (and their play­grounds) and are never too far away from a ko­pi­tiam or a hawker cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Start at the western end of Alexan­dra Canal in Tan­glin Road near the quaint Masjid Jamek Queen­stown (946 Mar­garet Drive) and fol­low the canal on the idyl­lic Alexan­dra Park Con­nec­tor.</p>
    <p>Take a small de­tour when you reach Prince Charles Cres­cent to Tiong Bahru Play­ground</p>
    <p>(along Tiong Bahru Road) of the tilt­ing train fame.</p>
    <p>Walk through Tiong Bahru Park and take a left on Lower Delta Road to get back to the park con­nec­tor.</p>
    <p>Make sure you are on the north­ern bank be­cause 10 min­utes into the walk, you will see Zion River­side Food Cen­tre (70 Zion Road), with its lovely lo­ca­tion right by the canal.</p>
    <p>If it is open, stop by for a juice or an iced cof­fee.</p>
    <p>Con­tinue along the canal as it be­comes the Sin­ga­pore River af­ter Zion Road, which will take you to STPI – Cre­ative Work­shop & Gallery (41 Robert­son Quay).</p>
    <p>We have al­ways loved pop­ping in as its cu­ra­tion is usu­ally on point and its ex­hi­bi­tion size man­age­able for young chil­dren. En­try is free.</p>
    <p>Do not miss its up­com­ing ex­hi­bi­tion Strange Forms</p>
    <p>Of Life that will be guest-cu­rated by Sin­ga­porean vis­ual artist Guo-Liang Tan. The ex­hi­bi­tion opens on Dec 5.</p>
    <p>If your child is as ob­sessed with tongkangs as much as mine is, end the day at Clarke Quay (right) where the rows of parked tongkangs are a sight to be­hold.</p>
