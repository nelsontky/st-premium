    <p>Shortly af­ter tour guide and founder of lo­cal op­er­a­tor Let’s Go Tour Robin Loh, 48, launched his new busi­ness ven­ture Un­der Da Boat Seafood Mar­ket in June, a mem­ber of the pub­lic con­tacted him to or­gan­ise a ke­long tour for his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“He ap­proached me as I have both guid­ing ex­per­tise and an un­der­stand­ing of the lo­cal fish­ing in­dus­try,” says Mr Loh.</p>
    <p>For­merly scep­ti­cal of the de­mand for lo­cal tourism, the re­quest changed his mind. Hav­ing fished recre­ation­ally for over 20 years, the co-owner of a half-cabin cruiser re­alised he had all the re­sources needed to get a ke­long tour up and run­ning.</p>
    <p>So he launched the Let’s Go Ke­long Tour in July. Since then, the re­sponse has been “over­whelm­ing”, with about 30 book­ings a month. A two-hour tour costs $450 for a max­i­mum of five guests.</p>
    <p>“We show­case a very dif­fer­ent side of Sin­ga­pore from the sea. Peo­ple may be fa­mil­iar with the sky­line but less so with the sto­ries of our wa­ters,” says Mr Loh, who guides all ke­long tours per­son­ally.</p>
    <p>He re­gales guests with tales of what he has wit­nessed dur­ing his years as a fish­er­man, such as how smug­glers in the past would race goods to Sin­ga­pore’s shore­line in small wooden boats, with the Po­lice Coast Guard in hot pur­suit.</p>
    <p>With over­seas travel halted due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, op­er­a­tors of boat and water­way tours are see­ing an uptick in lo­cal guests seek­ing any av­enue to go – quite lit­er­ally – over­seas.</p>
    <p>Lux­ury sail­ing ship Royal Al­ba­tross, which re­sumed sun­set din­ner cruises this month, has been see­ing healthy de­mand, with pop­u­lar tim­ings booked out weeks in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>It helps that cruis­ing lo­cal wa­ters does not cost a pretty penny.</p>
    <p>Ferry op­er­a­tor Sin­ga­pore Is­land Cruise, which runs a daily ser­vice be­tween Ma­rina South Pier, St John’s Is­land and Kusu Is­land for $15, added a di­rect week­day ser­vice to St John’s Is­land last month af­ter it re­alised that it was a pop­u­lar stop for guests head­ing to the beach at Lazarus Is­land. Both is­lands are con­nected by a cause­way, which takes 15 min­utes to cross on foot.</p>
    <p>Although he de­clined to re­veal fig­ures, man­ager Li Guoli says the com­pany has seen a “slight in­crease” in rid­er­ship com­pared with last year, mainly from Sin­ga­pore­ans seek­ing a quick get­away.</p>
    <p>One such guest was ac­tress Rachel Wong, 26, who went to Lazarus Is­land in July with three friends. They took along their own food and drinks and stand-up pad­dle boards for en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong, who was vis­it­ing the is­land for the first time, found it very re­mote and pri­vate, un­like Sen­tosa and East Coast Park.</p>
    <p>She says: “We were in the mid­dle of na­ture and the beach was very quiet. It felt a bit like go­ing on an ad­ven­ture, like we were not in Sin­ga­pore at all.”</p>
