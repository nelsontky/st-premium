    <p>The num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases world­wide has topped 20 mil­lion, as the spread of the deadly disease con­tin­ues to ac­cel­er­ate across the globe.</p>
    <p>It took six months for the tally to hit 10 mil­lion, but just 43 days for it to dou­ble to 20 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is spread­ing the fastest in Latin Amer­ica, which ac­counts for about 28 per cent of all Covid-19 cases and more than 30 per cent of all deaths.</p>
    <p>New Zealand’s world-beat­ing run of be­ing virus-free ended on its 102nd day yes­ter­day, af­ter a fam­ily of four new con­firmed cases of un­known source was de­tected. The gov­ern­ment promptly put its largest city of Auck­land un­der lock­down.</p>
    <p>It is not all bad news, though. Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day recorded its low­est daily tally since April, with 61 new cases. Two of those were com­mu­nity cases.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong, which has been bat­tling a virus resur­gence, also re­ported a sharp drop from fig­ures since the start of last month – an in­di­ca­tion that its out­break is com­ing un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>In Rus­sia, Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin an­nounced that his coun­try has be­come the first in the world to ap­prove a vac­cine of­fer­ing “sus­tain­able im­mu­nity” against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the Rus­sian health au­thor­i­ties are dis­cussing the process for WHO pre-qual­i­fi­ca­tion for the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The first co­hort of vol­un­teers here has re­ceived a dose of a coro­n­avirus vac­cine jointly de­vel­oped by Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and United States phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics.</p>
    <p>Arc­turus said yes­ter­day that this first phase of the trial in­volved vol­un­teers aged be­tween 21 and 55, who were in­jected with a sin­gle shot of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Data from this phase of the earlystage trial will be used to se­lect the dosage reg­i­mens of the next phase, which will in­volve those aged 56 to 80, as well as younger adults.</p>
    <p>Arc­turus pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive Joseph Payne said that based on pre-clin­i­cal tri­als, its vac­cine may only need to be ad­min­is­tered once, and at a very low dose.</p>
    <p>“These favourable at­tributes could greatly fa­cil­i­tate mass vac­ci­na­tion cam­paigns nec­es­sary to con­trol this global pan­demic,” he said.</p>
    <p>As of last week, more than 250 peo­ple here had vol­un­teered for tri­als of the vac­cine, called Lu­narCov19 – of whom about 100 were se­lected.</p>
    <p>The trial, which is be­ing ad­min­is­tered by the SingHealth In­ves­ti­ga­tional Medicine Unit, is ex­pected to last un­til Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported last month that the vac­cine was orig­i­nally slated to be­gin tri­als next month, but had been ap­proved ahead of time when pre-clin­i­cal tri­als ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>Lu­nar-Cov19 con­tains ge­netic ma­te­rial called mRNA, which en­codes part of the virus.</p>
    <p>When in­jected into a per­son, it causes the body’s cells to be­gin man­u­fac­tur­ing a pro­tein sim­i­lar to that of the virus, al­low­ing the body to recog­nise and learn to fight it.</p>
    <p>This sets it apart from tra­di­tional vac­cines which teach the body to recog­nise the ad­ver­sary by us­ing a killed or weak­ened form of the virus.</p>
    <p>The global race for a Covid-19 vac­cine has in­ten­si­fied in re­cent weeks, as it is seen by many around the world as the key to re­open­ing bor­ders and economies amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As of Mon­day, there were 28 vac­cine can­di­dates, in­clud­ing Lu­narCov19, un­der­go­ing clin­i­cal tri­als around the world – two more than just two days be­fore that.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin de­clared that his coun­try had been the first in the world to grant reg­u­la­tory ap­proval to a Covid-19 vac­cine af­ter less than two months of hu­man test­ing.</p>
    <p>But this was al­most im­me­di­ately fol­lowed by global health ex­perts call­ing it “reck­less” due to a lack of large-scale tri­als to prove that the vac­cine ac­tu­ally works.</p>
    <p>Dr Michael Ryan, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s health emer­gen­cies pro­gramme, had ear­lier said that an ef­fec­tive vac­cine would likely be ready only early next year.</p>

The Amer&#xAD;i&#xAD;can firm says that based on pre-clin&#xAD;i&#xAD;cal tri&#xAD;als, the vac&#xAD;cine may only need to be ad&#xAD;min&#xAD;is&#xAD;tered once, and at a very low dose.</p>
