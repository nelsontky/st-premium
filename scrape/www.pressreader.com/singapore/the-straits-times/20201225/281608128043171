    <p>All Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) cabin crew mem­bers work­ing on flights from Lon­don will now have to wear N95 masks and pro­tec­tive over­alls amid grow­ing con­cerns about the new strain of the Covid-19 virus in the city.</p>
    <p>They will also have to take Covid-19 swab tests af­ter their re­turn. They will not be al­lowed to re­sume work on other flights un­til they get a neg­a­tive re­sult, in line with the usual prac­tice when fly­ing to ar­eas with higher risks of Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>SIA cur­rently op­er­ates two di­rect flights daily from Lon­don’s Heathrow Air­port on most days. Each is about 13 hours long.</p>
    <p>The ad­di­tional re­quire­ments for pro­tec­tive equip­ment for flights from Lon­don kicked in on Wed­nes­day, SIA said yes­ter­day. Prior to this, cabin crew had al­ready been wear­ing gog­gles, gloves and sur­gi­cal masks for all flights.</p>
    <p>Re­ports about a new strain of the coro­n­avirus that is 70 per cent more in­fec­tious sur­faced last week.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Sin­ga­pore joined more than 40 other coun­tries in tight­en­ing re­stric­tions on trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health had said that all long-term pass hold­ers and short-term vis­i­tors with travel his­tory to Bri­tain within the last 14 days will not be al­lowed to en­ter or tran­sit through Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>SIA said yes­ter­day that it al­ready has a se­ries of pre­cau­tions to pro­tect its crew.</p>
    <p>For long-haul flights where the crew have to stay over in the des­ti­na­tion coun­try, SIA has been char­ter­ing a ded­i­cated bus for the crew to be trans­ported to and from ho­tels, which are lo­cated away from city cen­tres.</p>
    <p>“All crew are re­quired to stay in their ho­tel rooms dur­ing the lay­over pe­riod, and they need to wear de­vices that track their lo­ca­tion to en­sure that they com­ply with this reg­u­la­tion,” said SIA.</p>
    <p>They must also take their tem­per­a­ture regularly and closely mon­i­tor their health through­out their duty pe­riod.</p>
