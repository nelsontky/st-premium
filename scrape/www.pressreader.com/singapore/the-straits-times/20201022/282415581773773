    <p>Tan Boon Wah may have a full-time day job as a cor­po­rate real es­tate lawyer, but he also has a side gig as a mu­si­cian – which led to a Golden Horse Award nom­i­na­tion, no less.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old Sin­ga­porean is up for best orig­i­nal film song as one of the three com­posers and lyri­cists be­hind Your Name En­graved Herein – the theme song for the Tai­wanese movie of the same name.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times over the tele­phone, the bach­e­lor says he found out about the nom­i­na­tion watch­ing the live-streamed nom­i­na­tion an­nounce­ments on Sept 30 as he knew his song had been sub­mit­ted for con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s quite ex­cit­ing, I didn’t ex­pect to be nom­i­nated. It’s meant to be a Man­dopop song and I thought maybe the judges would go for some­thing less main­stream and more avant-garde,” he says.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous Sin­ga­porean nom­i­nees in this cat­e­gory in­clude Dick Lee for the Hong Kong ro­mance City Of Glass (1998) and Jack Neo for the drama Homerun (2003).</p>
    <p>They did not win, but Ricky Ho won the Golden Horse Award for Best Score for Tai­wanese his­tor­i­cal ac­tion epic War­riors Of The Rain­bow: Seediq Bale (2011).</p>
    <p>Tan has com­posed songs such as Don’t Want To Let You Know (1999) for Tai­wanese singer Chou Hui and the Ste­fanie Sun-Tanya Chua duet, The Ori­gin (2005).</p>
    <p>He was asked to sub­mit a song for the movie when the film pro­duc­tion com­pany ap­proached Warner Chap­pell Mu­sic. Tan is con­tracted to Warner Chap­pell Mu­sic as a song­writer and worked with his Malaysian col­lab­o­ra­tors Keon Chia and Hooi Yuan Teng on the track.</p>
    <p>Tan says: “We were sent a writeup of what the movie is about and the film pro­duc­tion side told us specif­i­cally which scenes they wanted the song to be used in.”</p>
    <p>Your Name En­graved Herein, a movie about two school­boys and their il­licit love af­fair set in 1988 Tai­wan fol­low­ing the end of the is­land’s mar­tial law pe­riod, has been well re­ceived in Tai­wan since it was re­leased in the­atres there last month. It is up for four other Golden Horse awards, in­clud­ing Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tor for Leon Dai.</p>
    <p>It is not known if the movie will be re­leased in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Tan, who has yet to watch the film, adds: “From a mu­si­cal point of view, we needed a song that would fit the 1980s mood. Older songs from that pe­riod tend to have a very strong hook and a melody line that re­ally hits you hard.”</p>
    <p>He was sur­prised when he re­alised the song would be sung by Tai­wanese singer-song­writer Crowd Lu. “He’s a very es­tab­lished song­writer him­self, so I didn’t think he would sing songs writ­ten by other peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>When he fi­nally heard the song in its com­pleted form, Tan says: “I was moved to tears. Some­thing about the ar­range­ment, the strings, the or­ches­tra, the wind in­stru­ments – they’re not all that com­mon in Man­dopop now. I was re­ally touched.</p>
    <p>“Not many peo­ple un­der­stand that, as song­writ­ers, we are not al­ways very in­volved in the en­tire creative process. Once we sell a song, it’s out of our hands – like giv­ing away a baby. We’ve not fol­lowed the growth and evo­lu­tion of the song along the way.”</p>
    <p>Tan, who be­gan writ­ing songs in the late 1990s as a full-time na­tional ser­vice­man and con­tin­ued to dab­ble in mu­sic dur­ing his stud­ies at the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore, turned to fo­cus fully on his le­gal ca­reer in pri­vate prac­tice in 2005. As a young le­gal pro­fes­sional, he of­ten had to work late nights and so he stepped away from mu­sic for more than 10 years.</p>
    <p>He says: “I have ev­ery in­ten­tion on con­tin­u­ing on as a lawyer. Song­writ­ing re­ally doesn’t give a sta­ble in­come.”</p>
    <p>But he re­turned to write mu­sic in 2016, when his le­gal ca­reer be­came more set­tled and he had more con­trol over his time.</p>
    <p>Tan, who is con­sid­er­ing go­ing to Taipei for the awards cer­e­mony on Nov 21, says his love of mu­sic never went away. “Mu­sic has al­ways been a part of me. It’s not some­thing I can sim­ply ex­tri­cate from my per­son.”</p>
    <p>I was moved to tears. Some­thing about the ar­range­ment, the strings, the or­ches­tra, the wind in­stru­ments – they’re not all that com­mon in Man­dopop now. I was re­ally touched.</p>
