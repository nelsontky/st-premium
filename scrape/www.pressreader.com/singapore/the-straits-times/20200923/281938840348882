    <p>LON­DON • Face­book will take ag­gres­sive mea­sures to “re­strict the cir­cu­la­tion of con­tent” on its plat­form if Novem­ber’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion de­scends into chaos or vi­o­lent civic un­rest, the Fi­nan­cial Times (FT) reported yes­ter­day, cit­ing a com­pany ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>The com­pany had drawn up plans for how to han­dle a range of out­comes, in­clud­ing wide­spread civic un­rest or “the po­lit­i­cal dilem­mas” of hav­ing in-per­son votes counted more rapidly than mail-in bal­lots, the re­port said, cit­ing an in­ter­view with Face­book’s head of global af­fairs Nick Clegg.</p>
    <p>“There are some break-glass op­tions avail­able to us if there re­ally is an ex­tremely chaotic and, worse still, vi­o­lent set of cir­cum­stances,” Mr Clegg said, though he stopped short of elab­o­rat­ing fur­ther on what mea­sures were on the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed ac­tions come as the so­cial me­dia group is un­der in­creas­ing pres­sure to lay out how it plans to com­bat elec­tion-re­lated mis­in­for­ma­tion, voter sup­pres­sion and the in­cite­ment of vi­o­lence on the Nov 3 elec­tion day and dur­ing the post-elec­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns are mount­ing that even US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump him­self could take to so­cial me­dia to con­test the re­sult or call for vi­o­lent protest, po­ten­tially trig­ger­ing a con­sti­tu­tional cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“We have acted ag­gres­sively in other parts of the world where we think that there is real civic in­sta­bil­ity and we ob­vi­ously have the tools to do that,” Mr Clegg added, cit­ing the pre­vi­ous use of “pretty ex­cep­tional mea­sures to sig­nif­i­cantly re­strict the cir­cu­la­tion of con­tent on our plat­form”.</p>
    <p>Face­book re­fused to go into de­tail over its plans for elec­tion-re­lated con­tent con­trol, as ma­li­cious ac­tors might use that in­for­ma­tion to proac­tively work out how to game the sys­tem, the FT said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, dur­ing pre­vi­ous pe­ri­ods of un­rest in Sri Lanka and Myan­mar, the com­pany took ac­tion in­clud­ing re­duc­ing the reach of con­tent shared by re­peated rule­break­ers, and lim­it­ing the distri­bu­tion of “bor­der­line con­tent” that was sen­sa­tion­al­ist but did not quite breach its hate speech rules.</p>
    <p>Face­book is brac­ing it­self for what is likely to be a highly po­lar­is­ing US elec­tion, and re­mains in the spot­light af­ter it failed to catch at­tempts by Rus­sia to ma­nip­u­late the 2016 US vote.</p>
    <p>There are fears Mr Trump could try to in­ter­fere in the process this time, since he has re­fused to com­mit to ac­cept­ing the out­come, ar­gued it could be rigged and sought to dele­git­imise postal vot­ing.</p>
    <p>Face­book has been ex­plor­ing how to han­dle about 70 dif­fer­ent po­ten­tial sce­nar­ios, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the sit­u­a­tion, with staff in­clud­ing mil­i­tary sce­nario plan­ners.</p>
    <p>It has an­nounced sev­eral new elec­tion mis­in­for­ma­tion and voter sup­pres­sion poli­cies in re­cent weeks, in­clud­ing stat­ing that it will add cau­tion­ary la­bels to posts in which cam­paigns or can­di­dates pre­ma­turely claim vic­tory, for ex­am­ple.</p>
