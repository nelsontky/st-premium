    <p>While trav­el­ling along Yishun Av­enue 8, a fe­male mo­tor­cy­clist may have hit some py­lons at the side of the road be­fore los­ing con­trol of her ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>Nurse Fad­hi­lah Mo­hamed Hus­sain, 28, was found ly­ing on the road and taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal where she suc­cumbed to her in­juries.</p>
    <p>The ac­ci­dent on Jan 14 hap­pened about a month be­fore her wed­ding.</p>
    <p>In a coro­ner’s in­quiry look­ing into her death, a Traf­fic Po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer yes­ter­day said no other ve­hi­cle was in­volved in the fa­tal ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Staff Sergeant Fir­daus Suleiman said there was no de­bris from other ve­hi­cles at the scene and added that an in­spec­tion of Ms Fad­hi­lah’s green Honda showed no me­chan­i­cal faults.</p>
    <p>There was no video footage of the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>State Coro­ner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam found Ms Fad­hi­lah’s death to be an “un­for­tu­nate traf­fic mis­ad­ven­ture”.</p>
    <p>The nurse’s fam­ily had been “baf­fled” by her death, ac­cord­ing to ear­lier re­ports in The New Pa­per.</p>
    <p>Her cousin, Mr Jad Hamzah, 50, said in the news­pa­per in­ter­view that fam­ily mem­bers found it hard to ac­cept that she could have crashed on her own.</p>
    <p>He de­scribed her as a “safe rider who used all the proper gear”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Se­nior Staff Sgt Fir­daus told the court that Ms Fad­hi­lah had left her work­place around 3pm to 4pm on Jan 14 to go to the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity build­ing in Kal­lang Road to col­lect her pass­port.</p>
    <p>She was rid­ing her mo­tor­cy­cle home when the ac­ci­dent oc­curred.</p>
    <p>The po­lice were alerted around 5.30pm and of­fi­cers who ar­rived at the scene found her ly­ing on the road.</p>
    <p>Mr Jad said in the ear­lier in­ter­view that his cousin was in the midst of pre­par­ing for her wed­ding.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing was pre­pared, the wed­ding was just around the cor­ner and she was go­ing to Italy and Europe with her hus­band-to-be.”</p>
    <p>Ms Fad­hi­lah’s older brother, Mr Mo­hamed Nor Mo­hamed Hus­sain, was in court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times l ater ap­proached the 46-year-old out­side the court­room, he said: “My fam­ily just wants clo­sure.”</p>
