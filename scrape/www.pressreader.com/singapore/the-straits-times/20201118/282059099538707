    <p>The for­mer prin­ci­pal of a sec­ondary school who mo­lested seven teenage boys on sep­a­rate oc­ca­sions at his work­place in 2017 was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to three years and eight months’ jail.</p>
    <p>He will also re­ceive seven strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>The boys, who were be­tween 13 and 15 years old at the time, were at-risk youth with f a mi l y prob­lems, the court heard.</p>
    <p>They also had dis­ci­plinary records both in school and out­side.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old Sin­ga­porean of­fender had pleaded guilty in Au­gust to three counts of mo­lesta­tion in­volv­ing three boys.</p>
    <p>Eight other charges for sim­i­lar of­fences, in­clud­ing those linked to the other four boys, were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Both the man and the school can­not be named ow­ing to a gag or­der to pro­tect the boys’ iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>The man ceased to be em­ployed by the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) as of Jan 1, 2018.</p>
    <p>The court ear­lier heard that the boys were of­ten called to the gen­eral of­fice by the school’s op­er­a­tions man­ager, to ei­ther serve their de­ten­tion or be coun­selled and in­formed of dis­ci­plinary ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“Upon notic­ing a stu­dent... the ac­cused would call him into his room to speak to the stu­dent.</p>
    <p>“At times, the ac­cused would also in­form the stu­dents’ teach­ers of his in­ten­tion to speak with them and fix a suit­able time for them to meet him at his of­fice on the pre­text of dis­cussing their dis­ci­plinary is­sues,” Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Mark Yeo had de­scribed in ear­lier pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>The man would mo­lest the boys in his of­fice.</p>
    <p>Some­time be­fore Aug 20, 2017, the op­er­a­tions man­ager was talk­ing to one of the vic­tims, then 13 years old, about his dis­ci­plinary is­sues when the ac­cused in­ter­vened and said that he would take over.</p>
    <p>The then prin­ci­pal mo­lested the boy af­ter they en­tered his of­fice.</p>
    <p>The DPP said: “(The boy) did not dis­close the in­ci­dent to any­one in its im­me­di­ate af­ter­math. Given his dis­ci­plinary is­sues, he felt that no one would be­lieve him if he were to dis­close what the ac­cused had done to him.”</p>
    <p>By us­ing a sim­i­lar ruse, the man mo­lested a 14-year-old boy in Septem­ber 2017 and a 13-year-old boy the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>In late Oc­to­ber that year, the man mo­lested another 14-year-old boy, who told another vic­tim, a 15-year-old stu­dent, about his or­deal.</p>
    <p>On Oct 25, 2017, the t wo teenagers told the op­er­a­tions man­ager about their ex­pe­ri­ence and the mat­ter was re­ported to the MOE.</p>
    <p>An MOE of­fi­cer alerted the po­lice on Nov 6 that year, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Upon notic­ing a stu­dent... the ac­cused would call him into his room to speak to the stu­dent. At times, the ac­cused would also in­form the stu­dents’ teach­ers of his in­ten­tion to speak with them and fix a suit­able time for them to meet him at his of­fice on the pre­text of dis­cussing their dis­ci­plinary is­sues.</p>
