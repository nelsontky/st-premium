    <p>As the pan­demic closed off bor­ders and shut­tered busi­nesses, Sin­ga­pore saw its pop­u­la­tion dip for the first time in 10 years as a large num­ber of for­eign­ers left its shores. There was move­ment in the other di­rec­tion too, as many Sin­ga­pore­ans who had been liv­ing over­seas de­cided to head back home.</p>
    <p>As the Covid-19 pan­demic closed off bor­ders and shut­tered busi­nesses, Sin­ga­pore saw its pop­u­la­tion dip for the first time in 10 years as many for­eign work­ers left af­ter los­ing their jobs.</p>
    <p>There was move­ment in the other di­rec­tion too, as many Sin­ga­pore­ans who had been liv­ing over­seas, de­cided to head back home.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans abroad fell from 217,200 last year to 203,500 this year. The de­cline was more pro­nounced among those who are 20 to 24 years old.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s non-res­i­dent pop­u­la­tion – the for­eign­ers who are here as students or on work passes, among oth­ers – shrank by nearly 35,800, on the other hand, to 1.64 mil­lion. This was a 2.1 per cent de­cline and the de­crease out­stripped the drop in over­seas Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>The re­sult of this flux was that Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal pop­u­la­tion dipped by around 17,800 over the past year to 5.69 mil­lion, the an­nual Pop­u­la­tion in Brief re­port said.</p>
    <p>For­eign em­ploy­ment in the ser­vice sec­tor was re­duced, with work per­mit hold­ers see­ing the largest drop, the re­port added.</p>
    <p>It noted that since the tight­en­ing of Sin­ga­pore’s im­mi­gra­tion frame­work in late 2009, the coun­try has ac­cepted about 30,000 new per­ma­nent res­i­dents a year.</p>
    <p>It said: “This keeps the PR pop­u­la­tion size sta­ble, and pro­vides a pool of can­di­dates who may be suit­able for cit­i­zen­ship. The ma­jor­ity of our PRs are aged be­tween 25 and 59 years.”</p>
    <p>The pace of im­mi­gra­tion will be kept mea­sured and sta­ble, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cit­i­zens grew by 0.6 per cent to reach 3.52 mil­lion in June, while the PR pop­u­la­tion re­mained sta­ble at 0.52 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Last year, 22,714 in­di­vid­u­als were granted cit­i­zen­ship and 32,915 were granted per­ma­nent res­i­dency – num­bers that have been largely sta­ble for the last 10 years.</p>
    <p>Of the new cit­i­zens, 1,599, or 7 per cent, were chil­dren born over­seas to Sin­ga­porean par­ents.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­la­tion growth rate over the past five years was also slower com­pared with the pre­vi­ous fiveyear pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With in­creas­ing life ex­pectancy and lower fer­til­ity rates, the pro­por­tion of cit­i­zens aged 65 and above is ris­ing, and at a faster pace com­pared with the last decade.</p>
    <p>The pro­por­tion of cit­i­zens aged 65 and above in­creased from 10.1 per cent in 2010 to 16.8 per cent this year. This fig­ure is pro­jected to climb to about 23.7 per cent by 2030.</p>
    <p>The me­dian age of cit­i­zens also inched up from 42 years to 42.2 years over the past year.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ol­o­gists were struck by Sin­ga­pore’s age­ing so­ci­ety and the re­duc­tion in the num­ber of work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Na­tional University of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser ob­served that the de­cline in the non-res­i­dent pop­u­la­tion is largely due to work per­mit hold­ers, who take up jobs which Sin­ga­pore­ans are not par­tic­u­larly keen on in the first place.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, he said, it sig­nals that some sec­tors of the econ­omy are not do­ing well. “The is­sue of for­eign­ers in our midst can­not be ad­dressed sim­ply by cut­ting down their num­bers, without neg­a­tive con­se­quences for our econ­omy.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment University dean of students and pro­fes­sor of so­ci­ol­ogy Paulin Straughan, told The Straits Times that in the long run, this could in­di­cate that Sin­ga­pore should be less de­pen­dent on man­power, and rely more on mech­a­ni­sa­tion and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“That may be a good thing be­cause of our man­power con­straints, grey­ing pop­u­la­tion and sus­tained low fer­til­ity rate.”</p>
    <p>She added that more at­ten­tion should be paid to un­lock­ing the po­ten­tial of older Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“This is a group of po­ten­tial vol­un­teers and driv­ers of communityb­ased self-help ini­tia­tives,” she said, adding that eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties should be cu­rated that will lever­age their skills and life ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>When Hong Kong-based Sin­ga­porean Sharon Liu, 39, and her hus­band Lim Eng Seng, 41, re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in Jan­uary, they had planned to stay only a short while over Chi­nese New Year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the grow­ing sever­ity of the Covid-19 outbreak soon changed their minds.</p>
    <p>With schools in Hong Kong shut­ting in early Fe­bru­ary, the cou­ple de­cided to stay put in Sin­ga­pore with their two young chil­dren. Their son An­dre is two and their daugh­ter Anya is three.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times, Ms Liu said: “Just be­fore the cir­cuit breaker started in April, my hus­band and I flew to Hong Kong to pack up our things and come back.”</p>
    <p>The owner of an events mar­ket­ing com­pany that op­er­ates in Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong said her fam­ily was al­ready think­ing of mov­ing back home by the end of the year, due to a com­bi­na­tion of fac­tors.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic sim­ply ac­cel­er­ated their plans and they de­cided to come home af­ter liv­ing in Hong Kong for more than 10 years. One rea­son was that their two sets of par­ents are get­ting old, and want their grand­chil­dren to spend more time with fam­ily in Sin­ga­pore, said Ms Liu.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal tur­moil in Hong Kong, marked by more than a year of on­go­ing protests, also con­trib­uted to their de­ci­sion to move back to Sin­ga­pore, she added.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, an in­vest­ment bro­ker, can work any­where in the world, Ms Liu said.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily are among the many over­seas Sin­ga­pore­ans who re­turned amid the pan­demic. Ac­cord­ing to the Gov­ern­ment’s an­nual Pop­u­la­tion in Brief re­port re­leased yes­ter­day, the to­tal num­ber of over­seas Sin­ga­pore­ans fell from 217,200 last year to 203,500 this year.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of over­seas Sin­ga­pore­ans per 100 Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens has in­creased grad­u­ally from 5.7 in 2010 to 6.2 last year be­fore fall­ing to 5.8 this year. Over­all, the growth in the num­ber of over­seas Sin­ga­pore­ans was slower over the past five years com­pared with the pe­riod from 2010 to 2015.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment University so­ci­ol­o­gist Paulin Straughan said Sin­ga­pore­ans will likely re­sume head­ing over­seas once travel re­stric­tions are lifted.</p>
    <p>She said: “A large group of these are younger Sin­ga­pore­ans who ven­ture over­seas for ed­u­ca­tion and em­ploy­ment. So as long as there are op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able, younger Sin­ga­pore­ans in par­tic­u­lar will take up the chal­lenge of es­tab­lish­ing them­selves else­where.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, I think while those head­ing for ed­u­ca­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties are likely to re­sume travel, those seek­ing em­ploy­ment over­seas might have to wait a lit­tle longer. Covid-19 has caused the global econ­omy to slow down.”</p>
