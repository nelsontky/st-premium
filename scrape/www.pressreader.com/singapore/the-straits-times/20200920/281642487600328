    <p>•</p>
    <p>MADRID The re­gional gov­ern­ment of Madrid is aim­ing to test one mil­lion peo­ple – about 13 per cent of t he pop­u­la­tion – for Covid-19 over this week in a des­per­ate bat­tle to avert an­other lock­down.</p>
    <p>Re­gional Pres­i­dent Is­abel Diaz Ayuso an­nounced the test­ing blitz on Fri­day as she im­posed a ban on all non-es­sen­tial movement in 37 hot spots in and around the Span­ish cap­i­tal, where the in­fec­tion rate has spiked above 1,000 per 100,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>That means more than 1 per cent of the lo­cal com­mu­nity has been in­fected in two weeks.</p>
    <p>Madrid has be­come the epi­cen­tre of the Span­ish out­break as gov­ern­ments around Europe bat­tle to con­tain a resur­gence in in­fec­tions that is threat­en­ing to un­der­mine recovery.</p>
    <p>Across the con­ti­nent, alarm is growing that of­fi­cials may be forced to re­turn to the kind of harsh curbs that shut down much of the econ­omy dur­ing the first part of the year.</p>
    <p>“An­other lock­down would be an eco­nomic dis­as­ter,” Ms Ayuso said at a press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“We need to use all means at our</p>
    <p>dis­posal to avoid it.”</p>
    <p>More than 640,000 peo­ple have been di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 in Spain, the health au­thor­i­ties said on</p>
    <p>Fri­day, with a rise of 4,697 in the past 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Nearly 30,500 peo­ple have died. Health of­fi­cials are blam­ing the in­crease on so­cial gath­er­ings, es­pe­cially among younger peo­ple, and on the sum­mer hol­i­day sea­son, which made Spain par­tic­u­larly ex­posed.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians are re­luc­tant to reim­pose more lock­downs with vot­ers al­ready fed up af­ter more than six months of disruption to daily life.</p>
    <p>Ms Ayuso is ex­pected to meet Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez this week to dis­cuss the growing cri­sis amid spec­u­la­tion that the whole of the Span­ish cap­i­tal could be put back into lock­down.</p>
    <p>A par­tial lock­down is set to be­gin in some of Madrid’s poorer dis­tricts this week, but residents of one of the worst-hit neigh­bour­hoods said yes­ter­day that they doubted the new mea­sures would work.</p>
    <p>Val­le­cas, a south­ern district with a lower av­er­age in­come and higher im­mi­grant pop­u­la­tion, has one of the high­est in­fec­tion rates in the Span­ish cap­i­tal – al­most six times higher than that of Cham­beri, a wealth­ier, north­ern district.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese re­stric­tions are com­pletely use­less be­cause we have to travel from one area which has a lot of cases to an­other which has less and we are go­ing to spread it,” said 48-year-old Feli, a civil ser­vant who lives in Val­le­cas.</p>
    <p>Un­der the re­stric­tions an­nounced by Madrid’s re­gional gov­ern­ment on Fri­day, movement be­tween and within six dis­tricts that are home to about 850,000 peo­ple will be re­stricted from to­mor­row, but peo­ple will still be able to go to work.</p>
    <p>Access to parks and pub­lic ar­eas will be re­stricted, gath­er­ings will be limited to six peo­ple and com­mer­cial es­tab­lish­ments will have to close by 10pm in the ar­eas.</p>
