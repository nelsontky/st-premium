    <p>The two new im­ported coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day were asymp­to­matic and tested as part of a screen­ing pro­gramme, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>One is a 38-year-old work per­mit holder who came from In­done­sia, and the other is a 38-year-old In­dian na­tional who holds a de­pen­dant’s pass and had ar­rived from the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>The new cases take the to­tal num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Sin­ga­pore to 58,056. There were no new cases in the com­mu­nity or in work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries for the third day in a row, MOH noted.</p>
    <p>All iden­ti­fied close con­tacts of the two im­ported cases have been iso­lated, and they will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Sero­log­i­cal tests will also be con­ducted on close con­tacts to de­ter­mine if the cases could have been in­fected by them. Such tests are typ­i­cally done to de­ter­mine pre­vi­ous in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The min­istry re­it­er­ated yes­ter­day that the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with only one such case in the past week who is cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>MOH said on Satur­day that the clus­ter in Westlite Toh Guan Dor­mi­tory in Toh Guan Road East has been closed as there have been no new cases linked to it for two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods, or 28 days.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 57,960 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from Covid-19, with an­other seven cases dis­charged yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There are 53 ac­tive cases – 33 in hospi­tal but none in in­ten­sive care, and 20 re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 death tally stands at 28, while 15 peo­ple who tested pos­i­tive for the virus have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>The virus out­break has in­fected over 50 mil­lion peo­ple and killed more than 1.2 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide since it be­gan in De­cem­ber last year.</p>
