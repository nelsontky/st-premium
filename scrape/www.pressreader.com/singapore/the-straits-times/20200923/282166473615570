    <p>I ap­plaud Sin­ga­pore’s ef­fort to gather sug­ges­tions and for­mu­late a White Pa­per on is­sues con­cern­ing women devel­op­ment in the coun­try (Re­view of women’s is­sues to change mind­sets on equal­ity, Sept 21).</p>
    <p>Cul­tural, so­cial and struc­tural is­sues will be ex­am­ined to bring about a change in mind­set on the way women are treated within the mar­i­tal, work­place and so­ci­etal con­texts.</p>
    <p>But the scope of the ex­er­cise could have been ex­tended to cover is­sues faced by men as well.</p>
    <p>As so­ci­ety progresses and evolves, fam­ily dy­nam­ics and gen­der roles change too. Some as­sump­tions on gen­der roles no longer hold true in our so­ci­ety to­day.</p>
    <p>In the past, men used to be the sole bread­win­ner while women took care of the chil­dren and house­hold chores.</p>
    <p>Now, in many fam­i­lies with­out chil­dren, men and women have equal em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties. And in fam­i­lies with chil­dren, both the fa­ther and the mother can tap on help from their own par­ents or their do­mes­tic helpers to mind the young.</p>
    <p>Hence most women do not nec­es­sar­ily face a dif­fi­cult choice be­tween fam­ily and ca­reer.</p>
    <p>But chang­ing so­ci­etal dy­nam­ics such as greater fe­male rep­re­sen­ta­tion in the work­force and re­duced de­pen­dence on men have af­fected the role of men.</p>
    <p>Is­sues such as spousal abuse, fam­ily vi­o­lence and crime af­fect men as much as they do women. Men can suf­fer psy­cho­log­i­cal abuse and phys­i­cal vi­o­lence at the hands of their spouses.</p>
    <p>Helplines ex­ist for men fac­ing do­mes­tic vi­o­lence (Help at hand for men who are stressed out amid pan­demic, May 16).</p>
    <p>Men could also fall prey to sex­ual ha­rass­ment (Num­ber of male vic­tims of mo­lesta­tion on the rise, Dec 18, 2017).</p>
    <p>Con­sider that the late US Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg, who was an ad­vo­cate for women’s rights and also no­table for speak­ing against gen­der dis­crim­i­na­tion, had suc­cess­fully ap­pealed for an un­mar­ried male care­giver to be awarded the same tax de­duc­tion as an un­mar­ried woman.</p>
    <p>The sta­tus of women de­serves pro­tec­tion in so­ci­ety, hence the need for le­gal tools like the Women’s Char­ter.</p>
    <p>But the nar­row sub­ject mat­ter of Sin­ga­pore’s re­view may be crit­i­cised as gen­der bias by some.</p>
    <p>By widen­ing it to in­clude men, it would be even more com­pre­hen­sive in ad­dress­ing the is­sues faced by all mem­bers of so­ci­ety.</p>
