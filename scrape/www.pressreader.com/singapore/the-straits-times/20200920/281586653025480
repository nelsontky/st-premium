    <p>Ms Germaine Lim, 24, stays alone in a rented bed­room in Bukit Ba­tok and earns $1,000 a month as an in­tern in a con­struc­tion firm.</p>
    <p>All she earns goes to­wards her rent of $550, her meals and trans­port.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian, who is a Tu­ition Grant Scheme (TGS) re­cip­i­ent, has been strug­gling to find a job since she grad­u­ated from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore in May.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal science grad­u­ate sent out about 40 job ap­pli­ca­tions but re­ceived only one of­fer – for an in­tern­ship. This was in lieu of a full-time po­si­tion, which would have en­tailed a monthly levy of $650 if she had been hired on an S Pass, she said.</p>
    <p>“Though I didn’t get the job, I’m thank­ful they of­fered me an in­tern­ship as an al­ter­na­tive,” Ms Lim said.</p>
    <p>The three-month in­tern­ship may have bought her some time, but she is growing more anx­ious by the day.</p>
    <p>Her in­tern­ship will end in two weeks, and there are no promis­ing leads in her job search.</p>
    <p>“There are times when I feel re­ally de­mor­alised about not be­ing able to find a job be­cause of the fi­nan­cial strain and the men­tal stress of not be­ing able to serve my bond.</p>
    <p>“It’s frus­trat­ing when em­ploy­ers write me off the mo­ment I men­tion I’m a Malaysian,” said Ms Lim, the only child of a sin­gle mother.</p>
    <p>Asked what can be done to help strug­gling TGS re­cip­i­ents like her­self, Ms Lim said: “It would help greatly if the Gov­ern­ment could ex­empt us from the EP (Em­ploy­ment Pass) min­i­mum salary re­quire­ment, as well as the S Pass quota and levy. Per­haps, for­give some of the bond pe­riod while strin­gent re­stric­tions against hir­ing for­eign­ers are in place.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, who has been liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore for five years, sees the sil­ver lin­ing amid her dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>“At least I have my fam­ily with me here. My mum lives with one of my aunts, who is a Sin­ga­porean, and their flat is right across the road from where I’m stay­ing.</p>
    <p>“It’s less lonely, and I al­ways have some­one to turn to when I hit a wall,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim con­tin­ues to sub­mit two to three job ap­pli­ca­tions a day and is “hope­ful that some­thing will come up”.</p>
