    <p>•</p>
    <p>Fewer Amer­i­cans sought un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits last week, but the mod­est drop did lit­tle to dis­pel con­cerns that the US job mar­ket and wider econ­omy face an ar­du­ous recovery from the dev­as­ta­tion in­flicted by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic last year.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal ma­jor eco­nomic data point for last year, which saw a re­ces­sion of his­toric mag­ni­tude erupt out of nowhere, stood as a fit­ting re­minder for both how far the recovery has pro­gressed and how much more it has to go.</p>
    <p>While new claims for ben­e­fits re­ported by the US Labour Depart­ment on Thurs­day dropped for the se­cond week in a row to a sea­son­ally ad­justed 787,000 in the week ended Dec 26, from 806,000 a week be­fore, it left them at roughly the level they were three months ago and with lit­tle in­di­ca­tion they would show ma­te­rial i mprove­ment any time soon.</p>
    <p>The ar­rival of ef­fec­tive Covid-19 vac­cines and ad­di­tional fed­eral pan­demic aid have set the stage for a brighter 2021.</p>
    <p>But econ­o­mists agree that the still-rag­ing epi­demic and the frac­tured govern­ment re­sponse to it mean more hard months ahead be­fore im­prove­ment takes hold.</p>
    <p>“While prospects for the econ­omy later in 2021 are up­beat, the econ­omy and labour mar­ket will have to nav­i­gate some dif­fi­cult ter­rain be­tween now and then and we ex­pect claims to re­main el­e­vated,” said Ox­ford Eco­nomics lead econ­o­mist Nancy Van­den Houten.</p>
    <p>Covid-19’s un­ex­pected ap­pear­ance in late 2019 and rapid spread early last year brought an abrupt end to a record-long eco­nomic ex­pan­sion in the United States that had fos­tered the strong­est job mar­ket in gen­er­a­tions. It also brought down the global econ­omy, dash­ing hopes for a se­cond straight decade of un­in­ter­rupted growth and widen­ing pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>HIGH LEVEL OF CLAIMS</p>
    <p>The re­port also showed that as of the mid­dle of last month, more than 19.5 mil­lion peo­ple were get­ting some form of job­less aid, in­clud­ing from emer­gency mea­sures ex­tended by the lat­est coro­n­avirus aid Bill passed by Congress and signed by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. Those emer­gency pro­grammes now ac­count for roughly two-thirds of all on­go­ing job­less as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>As of Dec 19, the num­ber of peo­ple con­tin­u­ing to draw ben­e­fits un­der reg­u­lar state un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance pro­grammes had fallen to 5.219 mil­lion, the l ow­est since March, from 5.322 mil­lion the week be­fore.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists took lit­tle so­lace from that de­cline, how­ever, see­ing it more as the re­sult of peo­ple ex­haust­ing ben­e­fits rather than find­ing new work.</p>
    <p>The el­e­vated level of claims aligns with other re­cent weak eco­nomic re­ports, in­clud­ing a de­cline in con­sumer con­fi­dence to a four­month low last month as well as drops in both con­sumer spend­ing and in­come that same month.</p>
    <p>With per­sis­tently high Covid-19 in­fec­tion lev­els forc­ing re­newed re­stric­tions on busi­nesses and con­sumer ac­tiv­ity around the coun­try, some econ­o­mists now see a chance that over­all US em­ploy­ment had fallen last month for the first time since April, when 20.8 mil­lion peo­ple lost jobs in a sin­gle month.</p>
    <p>While pay­rolls have risen each month since then, the to­tal level of em­ploy­ment re­mains roughly 10 mil­lion j obs be­low its pre-pan­demic level.</p>
    <p>Chief fi­nan­cial econ­o­mist Aneta Markowska at Jef­feries this week said the com­pany’s in-house eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity in­dex, which tracks the recovery through high-fre­quency mea­sures, has fallen to a three-week low, led by weak­ness in mea­sures of con­sumer spend­ing and em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>“Taken at face value, our data sug­gests fur­ther down­side for re­tail sales, rais­ing the prospect of an out­right con­trac­tion in De­cem­ber em­ploy­ment,” she wrote in a note.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, with more fis­cal stim­u­lus on the way, we ex­pect the neg­a­tive mo­men­tum to re­verse in Jan­uary.”</p>
    <p>The Labour Depart­ment will is­sue last month’s em­ploy­ment data on Jan 8.</p>
    <p>PAN­DEMIC RE­LIEF TUS­SLE</p>
    <p>The lat­est labour re­port’s end date – Dec 26 – was when as many as 14 mil­lion peo­ple were set to lose job­less ben­e­fits pro­vided by a US$3 tril­lion (S$4 tril­lion) pan­demic re­lief Bill en­acted in the spring. That was a cliff that law­mak­ers had raced to avoid by pass­ing a nearly US$900 bil­lion sup­ple­men­tal pack­age in the days be­fore Christ­mas, in­clud­ing US$600 pay­ments to most in­di­vid­u­als and ex­ten­sions of un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits and eviction mora­to­ri­ums.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Pres­i­dent Trump railed against the deal ne­go­ti­ated by his own Trea­sury Sec­re­tary, de­mand­ing higher pay­ments to in­di­vid­u­als, and did not sign it into law un­til Sun­day, af­ter ex­ten­sive bad­ger­ing by se­nior law­mak­ers in his Repub­li­can Party.</p>
    <p>It was un­clear whether that lapse had a ma­te­rial ef­fect on last week’s data or what im­pact it might have on the level of claims in the cur­rent week and into this year.</p>
    <p>“The new stim­u­lus pack­age is a life pre­server, but con­tain­ing the virus is the only way to com­pletely end the eco­nomic chaos,” said econ­o­mist An­nEl­iz­a­beth Konkel at In­deed Hir­ing Lab. “Even then, a full recovery will have to clear the hur­dle of mount­ing long-term job­less­ness,” she added.</p>
