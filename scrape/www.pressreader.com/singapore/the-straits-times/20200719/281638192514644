    <p>MEL­BOURNE • Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son yes­ter­day de­layed the open­ing of Par­lia­ment for sev­eral weeks as the new coro­n­avirus con­tin­ued to spread through the coun­try’s two most pop­u­lous states.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son asked the Speaker of Par­lia­ment to can­cel a two-week ses­sion due to start on Aug 4, out of con­cern about the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The re­quest was seen as a for­mal­ity as the Speaker is a mem­ber of his Lib­eral Party and the op­po­si­tion Labour Party ac­cepted the call.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers are to meet at the next planned ses­sion on Aug 24.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment can­not ig­nore the risk to par­lia­men­tar­i­ans, their staff, the staff within the Par­lia­ment and the broader com­mu­nity,” Mr Mor­ri­son said in a writ­ten state­ment, adding that he acted based on the ad­vice of med­i­cal au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria state re­ported 217 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day af­ter a record 428 cases on Fri­day. Neigh­bour­ing New South Wales, the most pop­u­lous state, which has also been strug­gling to con­tain a new wave of in­fec­tions, saw 15 new cases.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s chief health of­fi­cer Brett Sut­ton said “217 is much bet­ter than a num­ber above 400, but it’s a num­ber that would have shocked us all a month ago”.</p>
    <p>“We need to re­mem­ber, it’s still a high num­ber.”</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria forced nearly five mil­lion peo­ple into a par­tial lock­down for six weeks on July 9, as ex­pec­ta­tions of harsher so­cial-dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions were grow­ing with the virus con­tin­u­ing to spread.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria Premier Daniel An­drews left open the pos­si­bil­ity of fur­ther curbs, urg­ing peo­ple not to leave their houses ex­cept for work, ex­er­cise or es­sen­tial shop­ping.</p>
    <p>“The like­li­hood of a longer lock­down, the like­li­hood of even more re­stric­tions – that re­ally does rest with in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies and mem­bers of the Vic­to­rian com­mu­nity em­brac­ing the spirit of the rules and erring on the side of cau­tion,” Mr An­drews said at a tele­vised brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s Trea­surer Josh Fry­den­berg said the gov­ern­ment will is­sue fur­ther in­come sup­port to tackle de­te­ri­o­rat­ing con­fi­dence across the coun­try, in ad­di­tion to an ex­ist­ing A$70 bil­lion (S$68 bil­lion) in wage sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>“There’s a lot of un­cer­tainty in the eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment and the Vic­to­rian sit­u­a­tion is a sig­nif­i­cant set­back,” Mr Fry­den­berg told The Age news­pa­per in an in­ter­view pub­lished yes­ter­day. “It’s di­min­ished con­fi­dence be­yond the Vic­to­rian bor­der and the re­cov­ery is a con­fi­dence game. So, main­tain­ing busi­ness and house­hold con­fi­dence is go­ing to be crit­i­cal.”</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is ex­pected to an­nounce de­tails of the sup­port mea­sures on Thurs­day, be­fore send­ing them for a vote to Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>In March, all par­lia­men­tary sit­tings were can­celled un­til Au­gust.</p>
    <p>But as Aus­tralia ap­peared to be suc­ceed­ing in con­trol­ling its out­break in the fol­low­ing months, some sit­tings took place, in­clud­ing a one-day spe­cial ses­sion to vote on the ini­tial wage sub­sidy scheme.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­wide, Aus­tralia has re­ported more than 11,400 coro­n­avirus cases so far in a pop­u­la­tion of about 25 mil­lion, with 118 deaths from the ill­ness. The vast ma­jor­ity have been in Vic­to­ria and neigh­bour­ing New South Wales. Other re­gions have not re­ported any new lo­cal in­fec­tions in weeks.</p>
    <p>NUM­BERS STILL HIGH</p>
    <p>217 is much bet­ter than a num­ber above 400, but it’s a num­ber that would have shocked us all a month ago... We need to re­mem­ber it’s still a high num­ber.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>VIC­TO­RIA’S CHIEF HEALTH OF­FI­CER BRETT SUT­TON, on yes­ter­day’s num­ber of new in­fec­tions</p>
