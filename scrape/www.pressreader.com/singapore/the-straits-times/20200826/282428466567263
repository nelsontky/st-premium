    <p>Board games were wel­come dis­trac­tions for cooped-up fam­i­lies dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>While phase two is good news for play­ers who swear by the tac­tile ex­pe­ri­ence of mov­ing phys­i­cal pieces, there are ad­van­tages to go­ing dig­i­tal.</p>
    <p>For one, dig­i­tal board games re­quire less set-up time. There are no pieces to sort and dis­trib­ute, and scores are tal­lied au­to­mat­i­cally at the end of the game.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal board games in­clude ex­tras such as tu­to­ri­als, a sin­gle-player mode, au­dio ef­fects or vis­ual an­i­ma­tions. Most let you play with friends around the world, which is handy, as the pan­demic is far from over.</p>
    <p>Prices for dig­i­tal board games are also gen­er­ally lower than phys­i­cal ver­sions. You can try many games for free at web­sites such as boardgamea­rena.com.</p>
    <p>Here are six dig­i­tal board games to try.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>Sagrada iOS ($9.98), An­droid ($9.99), Nin­tendo Switch (US$14.99 or S$20) , Win­dows and Mac ($10 on Steam)</p>
    <p>Sagrada (right) is a feast for the eyes that is easy to pick up. Two to four play­ers com­pete to create a stained­glass win­dow – in­spired by Barcelona’s fa­mous La Sagrada Fa­milia church – by pick­ing and plac­ing colour­ful dice on a 4x5 grid ac­cord­ing to a set of rules and objectives. The dig­i­tal ver­sion lets you play against com­puter op­po­nents and adds a colour-blind mode.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Ter­raform­ing Mars iOS ($12.98), An­droid ($11.99), Win­dows ($18.50 on Steam)</p>
    <p>Com­pete to be the first cor­po­ra­tion to trans­form Mars into a hab­it­able planet in Ter­raform­ing Mars.</p>
    <p>This strat­egy game re­quires play­ers to gen­er­ate or steal re­sources to place ocean tiles and other in­fra­struc­ture that con­trib­ute to a live­able planet.</p>
    <p>The app adds an­i­ma­tions and a sci-fi sound­track. There is a com­pre­hen­sive, well-de­signed tu­to­rial, as well as on­line modes and com­puter op­po­nents. The app also han­dles the drudgery of track­ing re­sources and points.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>The Cas­tles Of Bur­gundy</p>
    <p>iOS ($12.98), An­droid ($14.98), Win­dows, Mac and Linux ($14.50)</p>
    <p>The Cas­tles Of Bur­gundy is a com­plex tile-lay­ing game about es­tate man­age­ment in me­di­ae­val France. There are many ways to build up your es­tate and score points to win the game.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal ver­sion adds com­puter op­po­nents – with three lev­els of dif­fi­culty – and the abil­ity to speed up an­i­ma­tions for a faster game. There is also an Undo but­ton that re­sets your turn.</p>
    <p>Play­ers can com­pete against oth­ers on­line in ranked games or play up to five asyn­chro­nous games at once.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>Evo­lu­tion</p>
    <p>Free limited game; in-app pur­chase of full ver­sion for iOS ($6.98) and An­droid ($7.49), Win­dows and Mac ($14.50 on Steam)</p>
    <p>One of last year’s best-re­viewed dig­i­tal board games, Evo­lu­tion is a strat­egy game about evolv­ing your species to adapt to an ever-chang­ing ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>The app looks great – cards have dis­cernible text and art­work. A cam­paign mode works well as an ex­tended tu­to­rial that teaches novices the rules while pit­ting them against the com­puter. Play­ers on dif­fer­ent plat­forms, such as An­droid and Steam, can play against each other, as the app syncs player in­for­ma­tion across all plat­forms.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>Ticket To Ride</p>
    <p>iOS ($9.98), An­droid ($9.48), Win­dows, Mac and Linux ($10.50 on Steam)</p>
    <p>Build a rail­way to con­nect cities in the dig­i­tal adap­ta­tion of the best-sell­ing Ticket To Ride board game.</p>
    <p>The game it­self takes just min­utes to learn, es­pe­cially with the dig­i­tal ver­sion’s help­ful tu­to­rial. The in­ter­face is in­tu­itive, while the an­i­ma­tions and music liven up the game­play.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple ex­pan­sions based in dif­fer­ent coun­tries – each with its own quirks and game­play vari­a­tions – keep the game fresh.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>Tokaido</p>
    <p>iOS ($2.98), An­droid ($2.99), Win­dows and Mac ($10 on Steam)</p>
    <p>Earn points while stop­ping at var­i­ous places to per­form tasks along the road from Ky­oto to Edo in Tokaido, a leisurely, fam­ily-friendly game.</p>
    <p>The app makes the board game, which al­ready has beau­ti­ful art­work, come alive with lovely an­i­ma­tion. You can in­crease the game speed in the set­tings and both off­line and on­line play are avail­able.</p>
