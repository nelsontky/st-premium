    <p>Is the mighty US dol­lar about to roll over? Has Covid-19 fi­nally brought the cur­tain down on its 12-year bull run? If so, why is this likely to hap­pen and what could pre­vent it?</p>
    <p>These are some of the ques­tions in­vestors are ask­ing these days.</p>
    <p>Given that the be­hav­iour of cur­rency mar­kets is no­to­ri­ously un­pre­dictable and full of sur­prises, all an­swers are, of course, spec­u­la­tive. But even if no­body knows for sure, it’s worth con­sid­er­ing some of the ar­gu­ments of the dol­lar bears and bulls.</p>
    <p>On re­cent ev­i­dence, it does look like the dol­lar has hit a rough patch. Af­ter spik­ing to a more than three-year high in March as fear and panic re­lated to Covid-19 set off a flight to safety, the dol­lar has de­clined by more than 8 per cent as in­di­cated by the dol­lar in­dex which mea­sures its value against a bas­ket of six ma­jor cur­ren­cies, and is at its low­est level since May 2018.</p>
    <p>Last month, it had its worst month since April 2011.</p>
    <p>Since its March peak, the dol­lar has lost ground not only to other re­serve cur­ren­cies such as the euro, the pound ster­ling and the Ja­panese yen, but also against sev­eral emerg­ing mar­ket cur­ren­cies, such as the Thai baht, the Brazil­ian real, the Mex­i­can peso and the South African rand. It has lost about 6 per cent against the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar.</p>
    <p>Against cur­rency al­ter­na­tives, the dol­lar has been ham­mered. Since the start of the year, it has lost about 35 per cent against gold and more than 60 per cent against bit­coin.</p>
    <p>Dol­lar bears have be­come ever more vo­cal.</p>
    <p>In a June re­port, for­eign ex­change strate­gists from in­vest­ment bank Gold­man Sachs sug­gested that the dol­lar’s de­cline is “just the be­gin­ning of a larger struc­tural down­trend in the green­back”. They es­ti­mated that the dol­lar would fall about 20 per cent from its March peak – which means it has an­other 10 per cent plus to go.</p>
    <p>Dr Stephen Roach, for­mer chair­man of Mor­gan Stan­ley Asia and cur­rently a se­nior fel­low at Yale Univer­sity, goes even fur­ther, pre­dict­ing that the dol­lar in­dex will drop by 35 per cent from its peak over the next cou­ple of years, and that even the green­back’s dom­i­nance as a re­serve as­set faces chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>On a his­tor­i­cal view, a drop of this mag­ni­tude over a rel­a­tively short pe­riod is not ex­tra­or­di­nary. The dol­lar lost about 30 per cent from Jan­uary 1986 to De­cem­ber 1987, and then again from Jan­uary 2002 to De­cem­ber 2004.</p>
    <p>THE COVID-19 EF­FECT</p>
    <p>But to­day’s cir­cum­stances are be­yond ex­tra­or­di­nary. The</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pan­demic and the re­sponse to it fu­els much of the bear case against the dol­lar.</p>
    <p>What is be­com­ing clear, look­ing for­ward, is that the United States econ­omy will take a big­ger hit than those of other de­vel­oped coun­tries. In its June World Eco­nomic Out­look fore­cast, the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund pre­dicts that next year (which it con­sid­ers a “re­cov­ery year”), the US econ­omy will grow by 4.5 per cent, while that of the euro zone – which has tra­di­tion­ally lagged be­hind US growth – will ex­pand by 6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the fact that the US’ public health re­sponse has been sham­bolic com­pared with other de­vel­oped economies, the US is also more vul­ner­a­ble be­cause its so­cial safety nets are weaker than, for ex­am­ple, the Euro­pean Union’s or Ja­pan’s.</p>
    <p>The flex­i­ble US labour mar­ket, which makes it rel­a­tively easy to hire and fire work­ers, might be an ad­van­tage dur­ing nor­mal times, but in a deep re­ces­sion, it can lead to mas­sive lev­els of un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, the EU and Ja­pan have more pro­tected labour mar­kets, which make them more re­silient dur­ing down­turns.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the un­em­ploy­ment rate is run­ning at more than 10 per cent in the US, com­pared with 7 per cent in the EU and less than 3 per cent in Ja­pan. Dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2008, the US econ­omy was the first ma­jor econ­omy to fall into re­ces­sion and the first to emerge out of it, which helped fuel the dol­lar’s bull run since then.</p>
    <p>This is not likely to be the case with the Covid-19 pan­demic. The dol­lar bears be­lieve that the US’ weaker eco­nomic per­for­mance, go­ing for­ward, will be neg­a­tive for the green­back.</p>
    <p>The US au­thor­i­ties’ re­sponse to the pan­demic but­tresses the bear case for the dol­lar.</p>
    <p>In two dra­matic moves in March, the US Fed­eral Re­serve slashed its bench­mark Fed funds rate by 1.5 per­cent­age points to near zero, ef­fec­tively al­most elim­i­nat­ing the pos­i­tive in­ter­est ad­van­tage the US dol­lar pre­vi­ously en­joyed vis-a-vis the euro and the Ja­panese yen.</p>
    <p>The yield on the 10-year US Trea­sury bond has turned neg­a­tive in real terms, which also makes it rel­a­tively less at­trac­tive than it was com­pared with other ma­jor economies’ gov­ern­ment bonds, pre-Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Be­sides cut­ting rates, the Fed has also pumped un­prece­dented amounts of liq­uid­ity into the mar­kets, buy­ing up not only US Trea­suries, but also cor­po­rate se­cu­ri­ties and even junk bonds. Its bal­ance sheet has soared from just over US$4 tril­lion (S$5.5 tril­lion) at the start of this year to al­most US$7 tril­lion by Aug 3.</p>
    <p>Many an­a­lysts – for ex­am­ple, those at JP Mor­gan – project it will hit US$10 tril­lion by the end of next year, un­der a “U-shaped” re­cov­ery sce­nario, and will go even higher if the re­cov­ery is more slug­gish.</p>
    <p>While other cen­tral banks have also ex­panded their bal­ance sheets, look­ing for­ward, the Fed will likely re­main “looser for longer”, given Amer­ica’s deeper pro­jected re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The US fis­cal po­si­tion is also a neg­a­tive for the dol­lar. Even be­fore the cri­sis, the US al­ready had a larger fis­cal deficit than most other ad­vanced economies, at 4.6 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) in the fis­cal year 2019 (end­ing Septem­ber 2019).</p>
    <p>But af­ter the mas­sive fis­cal splurge in re­sponse to Covid-19, com­bined with a shrink­ing GDP, the deficit will ex­plode higher.</p>
    <p>In April, the US Con­gres­sional Bud­get Of­fice pro­jected that in fi­nan­cial year 2020, the deficit will bal­loon to US$3.7 tril­lion or al­most 18 per cent of pro­jected GDP, the largest among ma­jor ad­vanced economies.</p>
    <p>This has never hap­pened since World War II. Even in FY2009, the year of the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the deficit was 9.8 per cent of GDP. The soar­ing deficit will add to US debt (the ag­gre­gate of past deficits), which again is ex­pected to hit wartime lev­els of over 100 per cent of GDP by next month.</p>
    <p>While some other ad­vanced economies also have high lev­els of debt – for ex­am­ple, Ja­pan’s stands at around 240 per cent of GDP – what mat­ters for mar­kets is the speed of change in the debt pro­file and its tra­jec­tory.</p>
    <p>The US en­tered Covid-19 with a debt of around 80 per cent of GDP. A more than 20 per­cent­age point in­crease within barely six months is a red flag, es­pe­cially if much of it is likely to be mon­e­tised by the Fed.</p>
    <p>For many cur­rency traders, the likely re­sult of such an enor­mous ex­pan­sion of the sup­ply of dol­lars in such a short time is a de­base­ment of the cur­rency, which helps to ex­plain why the prices of pre­cious met­als and bit­coin (the quan­ti­ties of which are ei­ther slow to in­crease or fixed) have recorded es­pe­cially large gains against the dol­lar.</p>
    <p>THE BULL CASE</p>
    <p>But wait a minute, say the dol­lar bulls. What about the “fear fac­tor”?</p>
    <p>When mar­kets panic, as they did dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis and again in March, in the early stages of Covid-19, they sought refuge in the dol­lar. That could hap­pen again, es­pe­cially given that US dol­lar-de­nom­i­nated debt held by for­eign­ers amounts to around US$12 tril­lion, which means the de­mand for dol­lars will be high.</p>
    <p>Then there is the dol­lar’s dom­i­nance in trans­ac­tions. Most com­modi­ties are priced in dol­lars. The dol­lar is used in about 40 per cent of all global pay­ments and 88 per cent of all for­eign ex­change trans­ac­tions. About 60 per cent of the world’s for­eign ex­change re­serves are held in dol­lars. Much of this is not about to change, say the bulls.</p>
    <p>The bears have a dif­fer­ent take. While the “fear fac­tor” could in­deed re­cur, there are now other op­tions be­sides the dol­lar, they point out, such as gold, other hard as­sets and bit­coin that can of­fer in­vestors refuge.</p>
    <p>And while there was a dol­lar short­age early dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, much of that has been al­le­vi­ated by the Fed’s open­ing of swap lines with sev­eral coun­tries (which en­abled them to ob­tain dol­lars in ex­change for their own cur­ren­cies, or their hold­ings of US Trea­suries).</p>
    <p>Nor have many of the swap lines been fully utilised – which sug­gests the de­mand for dol­lars is not as great as the dol­lar bulls seem to think. And while dol­lar-de­nom­i­nated debt held by for­eign­ers may ap­pear high, dol­lar as­sets held by for­eign­ers in the form of stocks, cor­po­rate bonds and Trea­suries are at least three times as high – al­though there are a few in­di­vid­ual coun­tries that have higher dol­lar debts than as­sets.</p>
    <p>PLENTY OF AL­TER­NA­TIVES</p>
    <p>As for cen­tral banks’ hold­ings of re­serves, dol­lar bears such as Dr Roach point out that there are plenty of al­ter­na­tives to the dol­lar.</p>
    <p>One is the euro, the at­trac­tive­ness of which might in­crease with the move to­wards the mu­tu­al­i­sa­tion of Euro­pean debt, which would deepen the euro-de­nom­i­nated debt mar­ket, the ab­sence of which has been a ma­jor de­ter­rent to coun­tries hold­ing re­serves in euro. Once there is a large pool of euro-de­nom­i­nated bonds guar­an­teed by the EU, cen­tral banks would be will­ing to hold more of their re­serves in eu­ros – al­though the shift may be slow.</p>
    <p>Gold is an­other al­ter­na­tive. Some cen­tral banks, such as those of China and Rus­sia, have been in­creas­ing their pur­chases of gold in re­cent years. More are ex­pected to do so this year, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey by the World Gold Coun­cil, be­cause of neg­a­tive in­ter­est rates, the per­cep­tion of gold as a cri­sis hedge, and its lack of de­fault risk.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese ren­minbi may also be­come a more at­trac­tive re­serve can­di­date over time. So, as the dol­lar bears see it, the dol­lar’s dom­i­nance as a re­serve as­set will de­cline.</p>
    <p>While the bears make a com­pelling case over­all, the un­cer­tain­ties sur­round­ing the course and du­ra­tion of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the mer­cu­rial be­hav­iour of cur­rency mar­kets, geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions, and po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ments would sug­gest that the jury is still out on whether the dol­lar is ripe for a pro­longed fall.</p>
    <p>If this does hap­pen, it will not be a lin­ear process. On a day-to-day ba­sis, it won’t be vis­i­ble; there will be days and weeks – maybe even months – dur­ing which the dol­lar strength­ens in re­sponse to short-term events, like a strong US jobs re­port, an un­ex­pected break­through in a trade dis­pute or what mar­kets per­ceive to be a favourable US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion re­sult. Sec­u­lar shifts, by def­i­ni­tion, take years. So those who buy into the bear case would need to take a long view, and be pa­tient.</p>
