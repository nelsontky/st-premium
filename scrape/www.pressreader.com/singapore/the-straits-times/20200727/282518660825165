    <p>Fe­male-cen­tred live-ac­tion ti­tles Sun­day and Lady E’s Wed­ding Re­venge Plan won big at the Na­tional Youth Film Awards (NYFA) held last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>They each re­ceived three awards in the Open Youth and Me­dia Stu­dent cat­e­gories re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Cen­tring on the theme of the un­break­able spirit of youth, the an­nual awards had gone dig­i­tal in the light of the coronaviru­s pan­demic and took place on Face­book Live. From the 362 sub­mis­sions, there were 53 works vy­ing for a to­tal of 24 awards in the two cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>Sun­day’s Vicki Yang, 32, won Best Ac­tress for play­ing a char­ac­ter deal­ing with a full-body rash and wrestling with in­creas­ingly vi­o­lent ten­den­cies dur­ing a for­bid­den ren­dezvous with her sis­ter’s boyfriend.</p>
    <p>The film also won Best Screen­play and Best Live Ac­tion in the Open Youth cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>In Lady E’s Wed­ding Re­venge Plan, cre­ated by Ngee Ann Polytech­nic stu­dents, an ec­cen­tric young girl with a fear of grow­ing up at­tempts to stop her older sis­ter’s wed­ding. The work won for Best Live Ac­tion, Best Direc­tor and Best Edit­ing in the Me­dia Stu­dent cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>The story was in­spired by the re­la­tion­ship be­tween direc­tor Kath­leen Bu, 18, and her sis­ter, who is 23.</p>
    <p>Bu says: “I think any­one can re­late to the painful process of grow­ing up and I wanted to make this film to ad­dress our in­ner­most feel­ings of fac­ing changes and grow­ing up – no mat­ter the stage of life we are at.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral an­i­ma­tion works did well, es­pe­cially in the Me­dia Stu­dent cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Caught Off Guard, about the ful­fil­ment of dreams, won Best An­i­ma­tion for 3dsense Me­dia stu­dent Paul Ng.</p>
    <p>Sexy Sushi by Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts’ Calleen Koh, which fol­lows a piece of sushi’s rude awak­en­ing to the true mean­ing of its life, was recog­nised for Best Art Di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Many of the films were cre­ated by re­turn­ing par­tic­i­pants, such as Tan Wei Ting, 28, who won for Best Edit­ing in the Open Youth cat­e­gory for Under The Same Pink Sky, a mov­ing story of a woman’s life af­ter her breast can­cer di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>This is Tan’s sec­ond NYFA win. Her di­rec­to­rial de­but film, CA$H, won for Best Di­rec­tion in 2018.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Yeo Yann Yann (Ilo Ilo, 2013), who was on the jury for the first time, said: “I am im­pressed by th­ese young film-mak­ers’ abil­ity to of­fer fresh per­spec­tives. I hope to be able to work with th­ese youth one day and I am look­ing for­ward to see where the next gen­er­a­tion of film-mak­ers takes us.”</p>
    <p>The awards were first held in 2015. This year’s win­ners re­ceive spon­sored prizes worth more than $70,000, in­clud­ing cash, equip­ment and ser­vices.</p>
