    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Coro­n­avirus cases in the United States surged by 120,276 on Thurs­day, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally, the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive daily record rise as the out­break spreads in ev­ery re­gion.</p>
    <p>US cases rose by nearly 105,000 on Wed­nes­day. The grow­ing num­ber of in­fec­tions is putting pres­sure on hos­pi­tals in sev­eral states and caus­ing fam­i­lies to re­think their plans for Thanks­giv­ing din­ner on Nov 26.</p>
    <p>Twenty out of 50 states re­ported record one-day in­creases on Thurs­day. Pre­vi­ously, the most states that re­ported records for new cases in a sin­gle day was 16 on Oct 30, ac­cord­ing to Reuters data.</p>
    <p>The out­break is hit­ting the Mid­west par­tic­u­larly hard, based on daily new cases.</p>
    <p>Illi­nois re­ported nearly 10,000 new cases on Thurs­day and, along with Texas, is lead­ing the coun­try in the most cases re­ported in the last seven days.</p>
    <p>Other Mid­west­ern states with record in­creases in cases on Thurs­day were Ne­braska, In­di­ana, Iowa,</p>
    <p>Michi­gan, Min­nesota, Mis­souri, North Dakota, Ohio and Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, Ken­tucky, Ore­gon, New Hamp­shire, Ok­la­homa, Rhode Is­land, Utah and West Vir­ginia also set records for rises in new in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Some cities and states have an­nounced new mea­sures such as cur­fews or re­duced gath­er­ing sizes to com­bat the spread of the virus, but the US has taken no ac­tion at the fed­eral level. Seven­teen out of 50 states do not re­quire masks.</p>
    <p>Many coun­tries in Europe are shut­ting high-risk busi­nesses and even or­der­ing na­tional or re­gional lock­downs in the face of a sec­ond wave of the virus.</p>
    <p>US hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions of Covid-19 pa­tients rose to over 52,500 on Thurs­day, up for an 11th con­sec­u­tive day and get­ting closer to the record of 58,370 set in July.</p>
    <p>North Dakota re­ported only eight avail­able in­ten­sive care unit beds in the en­tire state on Thurs­day. Hospi­tal­i­sa­tion fig­ures are a key met­ric be­cause they are not af­fected by the amount of test­ing done.</p>
    <p>Coro­n­avirus deaths are trend­ing higher but not at the same rate as cases.</p>
    <p>The US is av­er­ag­ing 850 deaths a day, up from 700 a month ago.</p>
    <p>In re­cent days, six states have re­ported their high­est one-day in­creases in pan­demic deaths: Arkansas, Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, West Vir­ginia and Wy­oming.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has af­fected nearly ev­ery as­pect of Amer­i­can life, with a record num­ber of vot­ers mail­ing in their bal­lots in Tues­day’s elec­tion.</p>
