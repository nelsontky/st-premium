    <p>For the first time in five months, Ms Yen was able to re­turn to Kuala Lumpur to see her three chil­dren last week. The 46-year-old, who works in a bank in Sin­ga­pore, said she was ini­tially wor­ried about mak­ing the trip home as she wasn’t sure about the risks she would be ex­posed to and where she would be stay­ing while wait­ing for her Covid-19 test re­sults.</p>
    <p>A divorcee, she had vis­ited her three sons, aged nine, 11 and 16, every week be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Yen, who had re­quested to be iden­ti­fied by her nick­name, had ap­plied for short-term home leave un­der the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment scheme.</p>
    <p>She ar­rived at Wood­lands Check­point at 5pm last Tues­day and it took her about 45 min­utes to walk across the Cause­way to the Jo­hor Baru Check­point.</p>
    <p>She waited an hour for her nasal and throat swab tests to be con­ducted, be­fore she was taken in a van ar­ranged by the au­thor­i­ties to KSL Re­sorts and Ho­tel, where she had to iso­late her­self while wait­ing for the Covid-19 test re­sults. The ho­tel was about 20 min­utes’ drive from the JB Check­point.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Sunday Times from her KL home last Fri­day, Ms Yen said: “I was told I could wait up to five days for the re­sults, but I got them in less than two days.”</p>
    <p>At about 9.20am last Thurs­day, she re­ceived an email say­ing she was tested neg­a­tive for Covid-19. Those who test neg­a­tive are ex­empted from stay-home or­ders. She left the ho­tel at noon and ar­rived in KL within four hours.</p>
    <p>“In KL, every­one was wear­ing a mask. Like Sin­ga­pore, we have to check in and out of places we visit. Most of the peo­ple I see are very com­pli­ant,” she said.</p>
    <p>Even at the rest stops along the North-South Ex­press­way, peo­ple were don­ning masks, she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Yen said she paid RM200 (S$65) for the swab tests and RM300 for the two-night ho­tel stay.</p>
    <p>“I find the pro­cesses car­ried out by the Malaysian au­thor­i­ties pretty well con­trolled. I will go back to see my chil­dren again in De­cem­ber,” she said, adding that she is re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore on Sept 8.</p>
