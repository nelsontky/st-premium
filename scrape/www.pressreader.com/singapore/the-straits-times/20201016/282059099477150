    <p>From March to May, there was hardly a rip­ple at the APS Swim School pools run by swim­ming icon Ang Peng Siong. The coro­n­avirus out­break meant the academy had “zero rev­enue” in the pe­riod, said the 57-year-old.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment re­lief mea­sures meant he ben­e­fited from a rental waiver for his school’s Far­rer Park Swim­ming Com­plex base. But op­er­a­tional costs still ran up a five-fig­ure bill, forc­ing APS to im­ple­ment a 20 per cent wage cut for all its 15 full-time staff for two months.</p>
    <p>With mea­sures to curb the virus’ spread eased since June, the school has been able to go back to earn­ing about 75 per cent of the rev­enue it did pre-out­break, and staff wages have also risen to within 10 per cent of the orig­i­nal sums. But the strug­gle to stay afloat re­mains.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully for Mr Ang and his team, more gov­ern­ment sup­port is in the off­ing for pri­vate sports academies and clubs like APS. Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong yes­ter­day an­nounced in Par­lia­ment a Sports Re­silience Pack­age (SRP) that will see a fur­ther $25 mil­lion pumped into the sports sec­tor as it deals with the ef­fects of the out­break.</p>
    <p>This comes on the back of $25 mil­lion in re­lief mea­sures for the in­dus­try that was an­nounced in June.</p>
    <p>The SRP comes in the form of $13.5 mil­lion in op­er­at­ing grants to help crit­i­cal busi­nesses off­set op­er­at­ing costs from this month to March next year, and $11.5 mil­lion in ca­pa­bil­ity de­vel­op­ment for the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“It is def­i­nitely some­thing we look for­ward to,” said Mr Ang. “The sports and arts in­dus­try is some­thing that... is the soul and essence of the nation.”</p>
    <p>The cri­te­ria and pro­cesses for the SRP op­er­at­ing grant will be an­nounced by na­tional sports agency Sport Sin­ga­pore next month, al­though a Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) spokesman said busi­nesses that “con­trib­ute to build­ing our ath­lete pipe­lines”, such as pri­vate academies and clubs like APS, pri­vate league op­er­a­tors and fa­cil­ity op­er­a­tors, will be el­i­gi­ble. MCCY will pro­vide a grant equiv­a­lent to about 25 per cent of each busi­ness’ to­tal op­er­at­ing ex­penses, capped at $15,000 a month.</p>
    <p>Not­ing the im­pact the out­break has had on such op­er­a­tors, Mr Tong added: “We do not want these op­er­a­tors to be a ca­su­alty of the pan­demic. Our sport­ing land­scape with its broad spec­trum of dif­fer­ent op­tions will be the poorer if that hap­pens.”</p>
    <p>The SRP also of­fers sup­port mea­sures to en­hance ca­pa­bil­ity de­vel­op­ment for those in the sports in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The Blended Ini­tia­tive – launched in July to help events man­age­ment com­pa­nies and or­gan­is­ers adopt dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion as a core strat­egy – will be ex­panded to in­clude pri­vate academies and clubs. Sup­port will also be pro­vided to busi­nesses and self-em­ployed per­sons in the sports in­dus­try to grow dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties in ar­eas like con­tent de­vel­op­ment, while coaches can re­ceive a train­ing al­lowance of $10 an hour to take up CoachSG cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Level 2 and 3 coaches can also ap­ply to par­tic­i­pate in CoachSG’s struc­tured men­tor­ship pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Un­der-19 floor­ball coach So­nia Chia co-de­vel­oped on­line ma­te­ri­als for CoachSG’s home-based learn­ing pack­ages. Un­der the new mea­sures, the 36-year-old will be el­i­gi­ble for al­lowances if she con­tin­ues to at­tend CoachSG work­shops. On fac­ing chal­lenges of coach­ing dig­i­tally, Ms Chia said: “As coaches, a lot of times we advocate to our ath­letes the im­por­tance of the right mind­set, per­spec­tive and adapt­ing, and this (dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion) is a chance for us to do the same.”</p>
