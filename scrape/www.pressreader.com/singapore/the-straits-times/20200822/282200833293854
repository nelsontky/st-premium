    <p>The Moon is drift­ing away.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery year, it gets about 4cm far­ther from us.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of mil­lions of years from now, our com­pan­ion in the sky will be dis­tant enough that there will be no more to­tal so­lar eclipses.</p>
    <p>For decades, sci­en­tists have mea­sured the Moon’s re­treat by fir­ing a laser at light-re­flect­ing pan­els, known as retrore­flec­tors, that were left on the lu­nar sur­face, and then tim­ing the light’s round trip.</p>
    <p>But the Moon’s five retrore­flec­tors are old, and they are now much less ef­fi­cient at fling­ing back light.</p>
    <p>To de­ter­mine whether a layer of moon dust might be the cul­prit, re­searchers de­vised an au­da­cious plan.</p>
    <p>They bounced laser light off a much smaller but newer retrore­flec­tor mounted aboard a National Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion (Nasa) space­craft that was skim­ming over the Moon’s sur­face at thou­sands of kilo­me­tres per hour.</p>
    <p>And it worked. These re­sults were pub­lished in the jour­nal Earth, Plan­ets and Space.</p>
    <p>Of all the stuff hu­mans have left on the Moon, the five retrore­flec­tors, which were de­liv­ered by Apollo as­tro­nauts and two Soviet ro­botic rovers, are among the most sci­en­tif­i­cally im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>They are akin to re­ally long yard­sticks. By pre­cisely tim­ing how long it takes laser light to travel to the Moon, bounce off a retrore­flec­tor and re­turn to Earth (roughly 2.5 sec­onds, give or take), sci­en­tists can cal­cu­late the dis­tance be­tween the Moon and Earth.</p>
    <p>Ar­rays of glass cor­ner-cube prisms make this cos­mic ric­o­chet pos­si­ble. These op­ti­cal de­vices re­flect in­com­ing light back to ex­actly where it came from, en­sur­ing that retrore­flec­tors send pho­tons on a tight, neat flip turn.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing re­peated mea­sure­ments over time al­lows re­searchers to piece to­gether a bet­ter pic­ture of the Moon’s or­bit, its pre­cise ori­en­ta­tion in space and even its in­te­rior struc­ture.</p>
    <p>But the Moon’s suit­case-size retrore­flec­tors, de­liv­ered from 1969 through 1973, are show­ing their age.</p>
    <p>In some cases, they are only about one-tenth as ef­fi­cient as ex­pected, said physi­cist Tom Mur­phy, who was not in­volved in the re­search. “The re­turns are se­verely de­pressed.”</p>
    <p>One ob­vi­ous cul­prit is lu­nar dust that has built up on the retrore­flec­tors. Dust can be kicked up by me­te­orites strik­ing the Moon’s sur­face.</p>
    <p>It coated the as­tro­nauts’ moon suits dur­ing their vis­its, and it is ex­pected to be a sig­nif­i­cant prob­lem if hu­mans ever colonise the Moon.</p>
    <p>While it has been nearly 50 years since a retrore­flec­tor was placed on the Moon’s sur­face, a Nasa space­craft launched in 2009 car­ries a retrore­flec­tor the size of a book.</p>
    <p>That space­craft, the Lu­nar Re­con­nais­sance Or­biter, cir­cles the Moon once ev­ery two hours, and it has</p>
    <p>A retrore­flec­tor left by Apollo 14 as­tro­nauts on the Moon in 1971. Re­searchers have used re­flec­tive prisms left on the Moon’s sur­face for decades, but have in­creas­ingly seen prob­lems with their ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>beamed home mil­lions of high-res­o­lu­tion im­ages of the lu­nar sur­face.</p>
    <p>The Lu­nar Re­con­nais­sance Or­biter “pro­vides a pris­tine tar­get”, said Dr Er­wan Mazarico, a plan­e­tary sci­en­tist at Nasa God­dard Space Flight Cen­tre who, along with his col­leagues, tested the hy­poth­e­sis that lu­nar dust might be af­fect­ing the Moon’s retrore­flec­tors. But it is also a mov­ing tar­get.</p>
    <p>The or­biter skims over the Moon’s sur­face at 5,800kmh.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard enough to hit a sta­tion­ary tar­get,” said Pro­fes­sor Mur­phy, who leads the Apache Point Ob­ser­va­tory Lu­nar Laser-rang­ing Op­er­a­tion, or Apollo, a project that uses the retrore­flec­tors on the Moon’s sur­face.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to give you a smaller ar­ray and make it move on you.”</p>
    <p>In 2017, Dr Mazarico and his col­lab­o­ra­tors be­gan fir­ing an in­frared laser from a sta­tion near Grasse, France, to­wards the or­biter’s retrore­flec­tor.</p>
    <p>At roughly 3am on Sept 4, 2018, they recorded their first suc­cess – a de­tec­tion of 25 pho­tons that made the round trip.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers notched three more suc­cesses by the fall of last year. Af­ter ac­count­ing for the smaller size of the or­biter’s retrore­flec­tor, Dr Mazarico and his col­leagues found that it of­ten re­turned pho­tons more ef­fi­ciently than the Apollo retrore­flec­tors.</p>
    <p>There is not enough ev­i­dence yet to cat­e­gor­i­cally blame the dust for the poorer per­for­mance of the Moon’s retrore­flec­tors, and more ob­ser­va­tions are be­ing col­lected.</p>
    <p>But Prof Mur­phy said: “For me, the dusty re­flec­tor idea is more sup­ported than re­futed by these re­sults.”</p>
