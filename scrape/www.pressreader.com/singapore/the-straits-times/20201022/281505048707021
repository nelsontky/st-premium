    <p>In­dia has started plan­ning to dis­trib­ute the Covid-19 vac­cine when­ever it is ready as the num­ber of new cases con­tin­ues on a down­ward trend.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has re­ported 7.65 million cases so far, the sec­ond-high­est tally in the world af­ter that of the US.</p>
    <p>But the au­thor­i­ties re­main con­cerned about the po­ten­tial for another spike as the fes­tive sea­son – when large gath­er­ings are the norm – is just around the cor­ner.</p>
    <p>Health Sec­re­tary Ra­jesh Bhushan said the first phase of the plan from Jan­uary to July next year will in­volve vac­ci­nat­ing 30 million peo­ple, in­clud­ing health­care work­ers on the front line, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia. States have been asked to draw up their pri­or­ity lists.</p>
    <p>“We think if present tri­als pro­ceed ac­cord­ing to plan, the num­ber of doses would be suf­fi­cient to im­mu­nise pri­or­ity list per­sons,” he told a press con­fer­ence on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Bhushan said that un­der the im­mu­ni­sa­tion pro­gramme, In­dia al­ready has a net­work of 29,000 cold stor­age fa­cil­i­ties and a dig­i­tal plat­form to track the doses of vac­cines and the tem­per­a­tures at which they are kept.</p>
    <p>“We have these fa­cil­i­ties. Dis­cus­sions are go­ing on over what type of aug­men­ta­tion is nec­es­sary,” he said.</p>
    <p>An ex­pert group, in­clud­ing top gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and health ex­perts, is pre­par­ing the vac­ci­na­tion plan.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi has also asked of­fi­cials to look at dis­tribut­ing the vac­cine through the elec­tion mech­a­nism or dis­as­ter man­age­ment net­works, which are wide­spread and cover the en­tire span of the vast coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Modi has al­ready asked of­fi­cials to plan cold stor­age chains in ad­vance, strengthen the ex­ist­ing dis­tri­bu­tion net­work for vac­cines and pre­pare equip­ment like vials and sy­ringes.</p>
    <p>In­dia will no doubt be at the fore­front of en­sur­ing a global sup­ply of the vac­cine when­ever it is re­leased.</p>
    <p>The South Asian coun­try is a sup­plier of medicine for a va­ri­ety of dis­eases across the world and is known for pro­duc­ing high-qual­ity and low-cost medicine for In­dia as well as the global mar­ket.</p>
    <p>It meets 50 per cent to 60 per cent of global de­mand for many vac­cines, and sup­plies af­ford­able anti-retro­vi­ral drugs and 40 per cent of gener­ics con­sumed in the US, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by the Fed­er­a­tion of In­dian Cham­bers of Com­merce and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Still, ex­perts noted that noth­ing on the scale of vac­ci­na­tion planned for Covid-19 has been at­tempted in In­dia be­fore.</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenges would be both in the lo­gis­tics of the sup­ply chain and in the health work­force needed to ad­min­is­ter the vac­cine and mon­i­tor the ad­verse ef­fects. The for­mer may be more easy to solve. Or­gan­is­ing the ad­min­is­tra­tion of the vac­cine to the huge (1.35 bil­lion) pop­u­la­tion will call for a large health work­force,” said Pro­fes­sor K. Srinath Reddy, pres­i­dent of the Pub­lic Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia.</p>
    <p>“It will be espe­cially de­mand­ing if it is a two-dose vac­cine,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia and Bharat Biotech are ex­pected to pur­sue late-stage clin­i­cal tri­als of their re­spec­tive in­tranasal Covid-19 vac­cines in the com­ing months af­ter getting ap­proval, the gov­ern­ment has said.</p>
    <p>Ahmed­abad-based Zy­dus Cadila’s ZyCoV-D vac­cine tri­als are in Phase II, while a Rus­sian Covid-19 vac­cine has also re­ceived reg­u­la­tory ap­proval for clin­i­cal tri­als in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing epi­demi­ol­o­gist Shahid Jameel said that the liq­uid-form vac­cine would be best suited for In­dia.</p>
    <p>“There would be lim­ited ca­pac­ity in In­dia to store, let alone trans­port vac­cines to all parts of the coun­try if they re­quire mi­nus 20 deg C or mi­nus 70 deg C tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>“In­dia should go with vac­cines that re­quire stor­age and trans­port in liq­uid form (that is, be­tween 4 deg C and 10 deg C) and not the ones that have to be kept frozen,” said Dr Jameel.</p>
    <p>He added: “I feel the big­gest chal­lenge would be cold chain (man­age­ment), de­pend­ing upon what vac­cine is to be de­ployed.”</p>
    <p>He wel­comed the plan to use the elec­tion net­work for dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>“In­dia has a very good elec­tion net­work and it would be wise to de­ploy that. In­dia also has a lot of ex­pe­ri­ence with po­lio erad­i­ca­tion... and door-to-door vac­ci­na­tion cam­paigns, which can be de­ployed.”</p>
    <p>HUGE CHAL­LENGE The chal­lenges would be both in the lo­gis­tics of the sup­ply chain and in the health work­force needed to ad­min­is­ter the vac­cine and mon­i­tor the ad­verse ef­fects. The for­mer may be more easy to solve. Or­gan­is­ing the ad­min­is­tra­tion of the vac­cine to the huge (1.35 bil­lion) pop­u­la­tion will call for a large health work­force... It will be espe­cially de­mand­ing if it is a two-dose vac­cine. PRO­FES­SOR K. SRINATH REDDY, pres­i­dent of the Pub­lic Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia.</p>
