    <p>SEOUL For the third year run­ning, South Korean ac­tor-host Lee Dong-wook (right) has been named one of GQ Korea’s Men of the Year.</p>
    <p>The men’s fash­ion mag­a­zine also gave the ti­tle to three other male stars – Rain, Henry and Crush – as well as Woman of the Year to K-pop idol IU.</p>
    <p>All five will be on the cover of its De­cem­ber is­sue.</p>
    <p>GQ, which has edi­tions in var­i­ous coun­tries such as the United States, Bri­tain and Ger­many, comes up with an an­nual list of in­flu­en­tial stars who have made the news that year.</p>
    <p>Lee, 39, took on a break­through role this year in the drama Tale Of The Nine-Tailed, which be­gan air­ing last month.</p>
    <p>In the fan­tasy ro­mance, the suave male lead played a gu­miho, or nine-tailed fox, who used to be a moun­tain god, but ab­di­cated to be­come a civil ser­vant to search for his true love.</p>
    <p>Rain, 39, has been on the scene since 2003 and has achieved pop­u­lar­ity in­ter­na­tion­ally, in­clud­ing in China and the US. Not only is he a singer, writer and producer, he also acts.</p>
    <p>The mag­a­zine de­scribed him as someone who has an un­de­ni­able pres­ence in the fields of va­ri­ety shows and mu­sic.</p>
    <p>An­other multi-tal­ented star, Henry Lau, 31, usu­ally known as just Henry, was recog­nised for his in­spir­ing per­for­mances on the Be­gin Again Korea se­ries.</p>
    <p>In the pop­u­lar tele­vi­sion show, cast mem­bers travel around the coun­try and per­form as buskers, pre­sent­ing mu­sic to up­lift spir­its during the global pandemic.</p>
    <p>As for 28-year-old Crush, the R&B and hip-hop idol made waves with his fourth EP, With Her, which was re­leased last month and fea­tures fe­male artists on all tracks.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, he en­listed for his manda­tory mil­i­tary service.</p>
    <p>The sole woman to make the list this year, the K-pop idol known as IU, 27, was picked for her artistry and sin­cere ap­proach to mu­sic during her 12 years as a singer.</p>
    <p>Since her de­but at the age of 15, she has risen to be­come one of the best-sell­ing solo acts in the group­dom­i­nated K-pop in­dus­try.</p>
