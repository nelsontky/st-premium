    <p>So many stay­cays, so lit­tle time. What makes this ho­tel spe­cial?</p>
    <p>Lo­ca­tion, lo­ca­tion, lo­ca­tion. The well-ap­pointed ad­dress, in Tan­glin Road, places it within a 10-minute stroll to the heart of Orchard Road or Sin­ga­pore Botanic Gar­dens in ei­ther di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>It is also an op­por­tune spot for ex­plo­rations of nearby Nassim Road to launch your own Crazy Rich Asians’ tour of ma­jes­tic man­sions.</p>
    <p>Fam­ily-fo­cused malls around the cor­ner, like Fo­rum The Shop­ping Mall and Tan­glin Mall, are use­ful to nip out for books, games, sup­plies and snacks.</p>
    <p>Claim to fame?</p>
    <p>The pres­i­den­tial suite boasts a blind­ingly gold en­trance, a baby grand pi­ano, orig­i­nal works by Marc Cha­gall and a pri­vate gym. Kim Jong Un bed­ded down here for the Trump-Kim Sum­mit in 2018.</p>
    <p>Not sure if he used the gym. But if it is good enough for North Korea’s supreme leader, you can rest as­sured there is no slum­ming it out here.</p>
    <p>All rooms come with a but­ler. He, un­for­tu­nately, can­not help you mind the kids. But he can un­pack your lug­gage, run baths, shine shoes and brew hot choco­late.</p>
    <p>First im­pres­sions?</p>
    <p>A fleet of Bent­ley Fly­ing Spurs are parked out­side. In­side the stee­land-glass of­fice tower ex­te­rior, the aes­thetic turns old-world pala­tial vibes.</p>
    <p>The Art Deco rooms have hand­painted birds and flow­ers on silkscreen walls and heaps of Jim Thomp­son throw pil­lows. Chan­de­liers hang over­head.</p>
    <p>Look down – even the be­daz­zled van­ity ta­ble legs are clad in gilt and mar­ble.</p>
    <p>The lobby walls are adorned with paint­ings hand-picked by Mrs Ce­cilia Kwek, wife of owner Kwek Leng Beng.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore pi­o­neer art mas­ters like Liu Kang and Cheong Soo Pieng jos­tle for space with a for­mi­da­bly large 15th-cen­tury mu r a l , Gath­er­ing Of The Im­mor­tals, along with the odd Fer­nando Botero sculp­ture.</p>
    <p>The pieces have such eye­wa­ter­ing val­u­a­tions that dur­ing pre-coro­n­avirus times, there was an in-house art tour con­ducted daily just for guests.</p>
    <p>Sounds in­tim­i­dat­ing. Just how kid-friendly is it?</p>
    <p>At first glance, the stately St Regis is not a nat­u­ral choice for fam­i­lies. But it con­sis­tently rates 4.5 on TripAd­vi­sor, es­pe­cially for its at­ten­tion to de­tail.</p>
    <p>En­ter the room and a teepee, padded with down quilts, is – ever dis­creetly – set up in a cor­ner. The chil­dren dis­ap­pear into it with their de­vices and never emerge. Agerel­e­vant amenity kits are pro­vided for young guests.</p>
    <p>Ju­nior bathrobes and slip­pers, bot­tle ster­ilis­ers and strollers are avail­able on re­quest.</p>
    <p>A plethora of fam­ily din­ing op­tions are nearby – Puglia Al­fresco Pizza Bar at Nassim Hill, Sushiro con­veyor-belt sushi at Shaw Cen­tre or Shake Shack at Liat Tow­ers.</p>
    <p>Or head down­stairs to Yan Ting for its ever-pop­u­lar dim sum buf­fet brunch on week­ends.</p>
    <p>Please tell us there is a spa.</p>
    <p>A good place to hide from your kids is the Remede Spa. The Warm Jade Stone mas­sage, a deep tis­sue rub with heated and cooled jade stones, is fa­bled to fore­stall mum melt­downs. The price of get­ting stoned? $310.</p>
    <p>Next to the spa is a snug pool, over­looked by nearby res­i­den­tial tow­ers. It cur­rently has a 15-peo­ple ca­pac­ity, so ex­pect to wait your turn on busy week­ends. But the gym, which looks out at the pool, is handy if your fam­ily splits up to get laps done.</p>
    <p>It has a five-peo­ple-only rule, but sleep­ing in ap­pears to be the or­der of stay­cays, so you al­most al­ways have it to your­self.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>Make a trek to the Botanic Gar­dens on balmy evenings. If it is a spe­cial oc­ca­sion, ar­rive in style in one of the ho­tel’s mil­lion-dol­lar Bent­leys.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel of­fers a be­spoke pic­nic ex­pe­ri­ence for fam­i­lies, which in­cludes round-trip trans­porta­tion with a chatty driver, a two-hour per­sonal tour of the Unesco World Her­itage park and a pic­nic bas­ket ($350 for two adults and two kids).</p>
    <p>Loung­ing on linen at the Sym­phony Lake, nib­bling on scones with clot­ted cream served on tiered trays with sil­ver­ware – not dis­pos­ables – is grand.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel also of­fers ju­nior bak­ing classes ($98 a child). We had ex­ec­u­tive chef Thibault Chi­u­menti, who has his own YouTube videos on cook­ing with tots, guide a Madeleine-mak­ing session. He made the kids whisk and fold as he held forth on how to zest lemons and the im­por­tance of clean­ing up in the kitchen.</p>
    <p>The last point alone is good rea­son to sign up.</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: Bliss or miss?</p>
    <p>The St Regis, built in 2008 and never re­mod­elled, is show­ing its age a lit­tle.</p>
    <p>Its Art Deco style of grandiose pam­per­ing, heavy drap­ery and soap-op­er­atic crim­son couches and car­pets, seem a tad out­moded.</p>
    <p>But ev­ery­thing re­mains im­pec­ca­bly main­tained. Its most ba­sic rooms start at a spa­cious 534 sq ft. It re­mains the crown jewel of the Mar­riott Group of ho­tels.</p>
    <p>When all this is over, it will no doubt go on to host many more gilded for­eign dig­ni­taries. It was built to im­press. If you are stag­ing a pro­posal or mile­stone cel­e­bra­tion, it will do the job.</p>
    <p>HOT TIP</p>
    <p>Bang-for-buck eaters will rel­ish the ho­tel’s new Sun­day brunch, a for­mi­da­ble feast of Alaskan king crab, French oys­ters, grilled Bos­ton Lob­ster, seared beef ten­der­loin and Crepes Suzette. All the usual cham­pagne brunch sus­pects are am­ply rep­re­sented and served to your ta­ble in un­re­lent­ing pro­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The dam­age? $138 a per­son with­out al­co­hol and from $198 up­wards with free flow of cham­pagne.</p>
    <p>This stay­ca­tion was hosted by the ho­tel and is part of a weekly se­ries.</p>
