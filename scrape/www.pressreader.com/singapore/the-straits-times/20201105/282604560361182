    <p>Di­ver­sity and longevity are key aims for Poh Seng Song in his new role as ath­letes’ com­mis­sion rep­re­sen­ta­tive in Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA).</p>
    <p>The for­mer na­tional sprinter, 37, was ap­pointed in the first man­age­ment com­mit­tee (MC) meet­ing of the new SA lead­er­ship – led by its pres­i­dent Lien Choong Luen – which took place a week after the of­fi­cials were voted in by af­fil­i­ates on Sept 25.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to want­ing a “di­verse pro­file” of mem­bers, Poh said that they should have a good un­der­stand­ing of ath­letes’ con­cerns and is­sues, and be pas­sion­ate about the sport.</p>
    <p>He added: “One of our aims dur­ing this stint is to set up an in­fra­struc­ture for the com­mis­sion to re­new it­self in the years ahead.</p>
    <p>“We are keen to build a com­mu­nity where our fel­low ath­letes feel sup­ported and em­pow­ered. We also hope to work closely to­gether with the SA MC.”</p>
    <p>Poh, who served as SA’s vi­cepres­i­dent of fi­nance and part­ner­ship from 2018 to 2020, was free to take up the role after the for­mer SA lead­er­ship on Sept 17 with­drew its de­ci­sion to ban him from hold­ing any of­fice within SA and/or its af­fil­i­ates for two con­sec­u­tive terms, or four years.</p>
    <p>This came about after a board of in­quiry, formed to look into a leak of in­for­ma­tion from the pre­vi­ous MC’s What­sApp group chat, had al­legedly con­cluded that he was “very likely” the one who had leaked a mes­sage.</p>
    <p>Now, Poh only wants to look for­ward in his new role.</p>
    <p>“I’m hum­bled and ex­cited,” he said. “I ran com­pet­i­tively for 17 years and have seen the sport through many phases through­out my ath­letic ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand the ath­letes’ jour­ney and through my term in the MC from 2016 to 2020, I also un­der­stand the con­straints it faces. I feel that these ex­pe­ri­ences will help me in this role to fa­cil­i­tate and fos­ter an ath­lete-cen­tred fo­cus and em­power ath­letes.”</p>
