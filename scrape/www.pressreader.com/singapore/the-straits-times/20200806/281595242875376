    <p>Covid-19 re­stric­tions had forced firms in the con­struc­tion, marine ship­yard and process sec­tors to halt work since April, with many still un­able to fully re­sume oper­a­tions. But as of Tues­day, 265,000 for­eign work­ers in these sec­tors have been given the green light to re­turn to work.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 re­stric­tions have forced firms in the con­struc­tion, marine ship­yard and process sec­tors to halt work since April, with many still un­able to fully re­sume oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>But the dark days have be­gun to re­cede.</p>
    <p>As of Tues­day, 265,000 for­eign work­ers in those three sec­tors have been given the green light to re­turn to work, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM).</p>
    <p>Of these, 180,000 are res­i­dents in dor­mi­to­ries. This is a 73 per cent in­crease from a fort­night ago, when just 104,000 work­ers in dorms were al­lowed to do so, MOM said in a state­ment on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate up­date yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of Health added that the au­thor­i­ties re­main on track to clear all for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries of Covid-19 by to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>But 17 stand­alone blocks in eight pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries will con­tinue to serve as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>They cur­rently house about 9,700 work­ers, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>These work­ers have to serve out their 14-day iso­la­tion pe­riod and take a Covid-19 test be­fore they can re­sume work.</p>
    <p>An ad­di­tional block in Westlite Mandai, a pur­pose-built dor­mi­tory, will also re­main as a quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>MOM said the rea­son is that a dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tor had found that its res­i­dents did not strin­gently ob­serve the quar­an­tine re­quire­ments dur­ing the ini­tial 14-day iso­la­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Al­though many tested neg­a­tive at the end of the iso­la­tion pe­riod, we share the op­er­a­tor’s con­cerns and as­sessed that it would be pru­dent to go through an­other round of iso­la­tion,” the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>As of Tues­day, 127 more dor­mi­to­ries have been cleared of Covid-19, bring­ing the to­tal cleared to 1,109 dor­mi­to­ries and 52 blocks for re­cov­ered work­ers in 14 pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, about 273,000 for­eign work­ers, or close to 90 per cent of dorm res­i­dents, have ei­ther re­cov­ered or have been tested and found to be free of Covid-19 as of Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Many of them are stay­ing i n cleared dor­mi­to­ries or blocks for re­cov­ered work­ers, and can re­sume work once dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors, em­ploy­ers and work­ers have made the nec­es­sary prepa­ra­tions to min­imise the risk of new in­fec­tions, said MOM.</p>
    <p>A worker al­lowed to re­sume work will see a green ac­cess code on his SGWorkPass app, af­ter tak­ing spec­i­fied steps. These in­clude down­load­ing an app to up­date his health sta­tus.</p>
    <p>“Many dor­mi­to­ries com­plete the steps al­most im­me­di­ately, with al­most all com­plet­ing in a week or less,” said an MOM spokesman.</p>
    <p>Mr Thomas Oh, di­rec­tor of Beng Khim Engi­neer­ing and Con­struc­tion, is relieved that about twothirds of his roughly 300 work­ers can head back to work, though a small num­ber still face some is­sues ow­ing to Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, main con­trac­tors are al­lowed to have work­ers from only up to 10 dif­fer­ent ad­dresses present at a work site, which means some still can­not re­sume work.</p>
    <p>Mr Oh is among more than 100 sub-con­trac­tors who had writ­ten to the Gov­ern­ment in June about is­sues faced by the in­dus­try, in­clud­ing fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, MOM an­nounced last Satur­day that the Gov­ern­ment will give a full waiver of the for­eign worker levy for three more months, and more levy re­bates to firms in the con­struc­tion, marine ship­yard and process sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Oh said: “We felt pretty hope­less back then – it was like we were just wait­ing to die. But the Gov­ern­ment has re­acted pos­i­tively. The im­prove­ments in the past two to three weeks and the an­nounce­ment of more fi­nan­cial sup­port have given the in­dus­try a chance to fight for sur­vival.”</p>
