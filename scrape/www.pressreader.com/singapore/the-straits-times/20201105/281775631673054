    <p>•</p>
    <p>PARIS The blue­print for France’s sec­ond na­tional lock­down, which started last Fri­day, sounded straight­for­ward enough: Shut­ter restau­rants, book­stores and other “non-es­sen­tial” busi­nesses but let su­per­mar­kets, elec­tron­ics chains and on­line re­tail­ers such as Ama­zon keep op­er­at­ing so con­sumers can work and shel­ter at home.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the mea­sures have ig­nited a na­tion­wide back­lash.</p>
    <p>Small busi­nesses are re­volt­ing against what they say is un­fair com­pe­ti­tion from dom­i­nant re­tail­ers – es­pe­cially Ama­zon – that con­tinue to sell items they can­not.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians and trade groups have joined the out­cry, forc­ing Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron’s gov­ern­ment to scram­ble to come up with a new game plan.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the gov­ern­ment an­nounced its so­lu­tion: Su­per­mar­kets such as re­tail giant Car­refour were given un­til yes­ter­day morn­ing to drape giant plas­tic tarps over items con­sid­ered non-es­sen­tial, in­clud­ing books, clothes, toys, flow­ers and even dishes, to put them off-lim­its to con­sumers dur­ing the month-long lock­down.</p>
    <p>Since smaller stores can­not sell such items, the think­ing goes, big stores should not be al­lowed to.</p>
    <p>Elec­tron­ics re­tail­ers in­clud­ing Fnac, a large French re­tail chain, must rope off videos, books, tele­vi­sions and other items deemed “not es­sen­tial” for work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>The or­der set off a fresh round of chaos and con­fu­sion, as small busi­nesses chomped at the bit to open any­way.</p>
    <p>“We want to open, open, open!” Mr Fran­cis Palombi, head of the Con­fed­er­a­tion des Com­mer­cants de France, told French ra­dio. “Send­ing com­merce to big stores and on­line gi­ants risks be­ing fatal for our busi­nesses,” he said.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tors of hyper­mar­kets com­plained that the rules made no sense.</p>
    <p>“It’s a mess,” Mr Michel-Edouard Le­clerc, head of the E.Le­clerc su­per­mar­ket chain, wrote on Face­book on Tues­day. “In all the hyper­mar­kets of France, thou­sands of prod­ucts must be re­moved from the shelves in two days.</p>
    <p>And the list of au­tho­rised prod­ucts is still un­clear.”</p>
    <p>As for Ama­zon, the French gov­ern­ment is not im­pos­ing any re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>But Ama­zon France agreed to can­cel its pre-Black Fri­day ad cam­paign after Min­is­ter for In­dus­try Agnes Pan­nier-Ru­nacher called it “in­ap­pro­pri­ate at a time when 200,000 mer­chants are hav­ing to close their doors”.</p>
    <p>France’s leading politi­cians have gone fur­ther, urg­ing shop­pers to deny the US on­line giant their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“To the French, I say, per­haps dur­ing this month of con­fine­ment, de­lay or post­pone pur­chases rather than or­der them on a large for­eign site,” Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said on TF1 television, avoid­ing a di­rect ref­er­ence to Ama­zon.</p>
    <p>Paris Mayor Anne Hi­dalgo was more blunt. “I’m re­ally im­plor­ing Parisians: Do not buy on Ama­zon,” she said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“Ama­zon is the death of our book­stores and our neigh­bour­hood life.”</p>
    <p>France is al­ready suf­fer­ing one of the worst down­turns in Europe. While the cur­rent lock­down is less strin­gent than the to­tal con­fine­ment in the spring, it is ex­pected to knock the economy into another re­ces­sion after a mild re­cov­ery in sum­mer, based on fore­casts by the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund.</p>
    <p>Many small busi­nesses, in par­tic­u­lar, were hard hit by the first lock­down and never fully made up for lost sales after the economy re­opened in May.</p>
    <p>A large num­ber of smaller com­pa­nies are be­lieved to have be­come zom­bie firms, stay­ing afloat mainly be­cause of gov­ern­ment aid pro­grammes aimed at de­lay­ing a wave of bank­rupt­cies.</p>
    <p>France is try­ing to en­cour­age smaller firms to speed up a tran­si­tion to on­line sales as a way of mak­ing up for the bleed­ing, but many of them do not have the re­sources to do so.</p>
