    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s Bud­get 2021 has fi­nally been ap­proved af­ter sur­viv­ing threats, warn­ings, scares and some­times ridicu­lous ru­mours that have gripped Malaysia for six weeks.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the in­trigue need not have gone on af­ter the first vote on Nov 26, when Par­lia­ment adopted the bud­get at the sec­ond read­ing.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, Tan Sri Muhyid­din, 73, was sworn in on March 1 af­ter a week-long po­lit­i­cal cri­sis that en­gulfed the na­tion, sim­ply be­cause he was the only ac­cept­able com­pro­mise can­di­date among enough MPs who wanted to en­sure Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim would not as­cend to the pre­mier­ship.</p>
    <p>In the end, Mr An­war’s gam­bit in re­cent months of join­ing hands with scan­dal-hit Umno pres­i­dent Zahid Hamidi and former premier Na­jib Razak to oust Mr Muhyid­din was sim­ply too toxic.</p>
    <p>“An­war has to for­get about get­ting Umno’s sup­port to be PM. It is the end of the road for that idea,” Bow­erGroupAsi­a’s po­lit­i­cal risk an­a­lyst Adib Zalka­pli told</p>
    <p>The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>But spec­u­la­tion sur­round­ing whether the Perikatan Na­sional ad­min­is­tra­tion would be ousted per­sisted, and in fact grew pro­gres­sively more in­cred­i­ble.</p>
    <p>Right from when op­po­si­tion leader An­war claimed the now widely mocked “strong, for­mi­da­ble and con­vinc­ing” ma­jor­ity in Septem­ber, the open se­cret that he wanted the</p>
    <p>91 MPs in his Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion to join hands with Umno rebels seemed an un­likely prospect.</p>
    <p>One ru­mour that went vi­ral last week­end was that Mr An­war had se­cured up to 115 out of Par­lia­ment’s 220 MPs, and that his ally, the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party, had a to­tal change of heart about work­ing with Zahid and Na­jib, to the ex­tent of al­low­ing dozens of cor­rup­tion charges lev­elled against the duo to be dropped, and even for the lat­ter to head the govern­ment in an in­terim role.</p>
    <p>The mo­men­tum point­ing to a de­feat of Bud­get 2021 gath­ered steam on Mon­day, when two former foes – Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad and Umno’s ad­vi­sory coun­cil chief Tan Sri Raza­leigh Hamzah – held a shock joint press con­fer­ence pre­dict­ing the col­lapse of the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion and call­ing for law­mak­ers to vote with their con­science, and then to form a unity govern­ment os­ten­si­bly led or guided by these two veter­ans.</p>
    <p>The per­ceived po­lit­i­cal risk spooked in­vestors enough to end a five-day win­ning streak on the lo­cal bourse, with the bench­mark Kuala Lumpur Com­pos­ite In­dex fall­ing by 2 per cent in Mon­day af­ter­noon trade. It swiftly re­cov­ered as soon as the fi­nal bud­get vote was won on Tues­day evening.</p>
    <p>Through it all, Tan Sri</p>
    <p>Muhyid­din’s ma­jor­ity has stood firm. Aside from the ab­stain­ing Tengku Raza­leigh – the 83-year-old is Malaysia’s long­est-serv­ing law­maker – the other 111 MPs, in­clud­ing a hand­ful of Umno lead­ers who have com­plained about Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia pres­i­dent Muhyid­din’s lead­er­ship, were present and ac­counted for.</p>
    <p>This leaves Malaysia still mired in un­cer­tain times.</p>
    <p>“It has been 10 months since the for­ma­tion of the new govern­ment,” Umno deputy pres­i­dent Mo­hamad Hasan said on Mon­day, re­fer­ring to when the Dr Ma­hathir-led PH govern­ment fell. “Sadly, there seems to be no so­lu­tion... The con­tin­u­ous bick­er­ing has only fur­ther frus­trated the peo­ple, and as such, Malaysia’s lead­ers need to re­solve their fick­le­ness.”</p>
    <p>Still, some ques­tions have been an­swered, or at least re­placed by new ones. Mr An­war sim­ply needs to wait for a gen­eral elec­tion to be held and, for now, work at main­tain­ing his po­si­tion as the op­po­si­tion’s prime min­is­te­rial can­di­date, in the face of a chal­lenge by former Sabah chief min­is­ter Shafie Ap­dal.</p>
    <p>Former premier Ma­hathir, 95, con­tin­ues to be a widely re­spected fig­ure. But even his in­flu­ence com­bined with that of a se­nior Umno MP failed to sway the rul­ing elite.</p>
    <p>And for those in Umno who de­cided to back Mr Muhyid­din 10 months ago, Bud­get 2021’s pas­sage in­di­cates that they have to lie in the bed they have made. Whether they like it or not, they are stuck with this prime min­is­ter un­til an elec­tion can be called, once the resur­gent coron­avirus pan­demic is over.</p>
    <p>Given the per­sis­tent rate of in­fec­tions, it may re­quire a vac­cine to be rolled out na­tion­wide. By then, this govern­ment might be twice as old as it is to­day.</p>
