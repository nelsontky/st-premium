    <p>BEN­GALURU • The resur­gence in coro­n­avirus cases is the big­gest threat to the re­cov­er­ing euro zone econ­omy, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters poll of econ­o­mists, who say growth and in­fla­tion are more likely to cre­ate neg­a­tive sur­prises over the com­ing year than pos­i­tive ones.</p>
    <p>Around 30 mil­lion peo­ple have been in­fected by the virus glob­ally, and more than 900,000 have died, trig­ger­ing some of the deep­est re­ces­sions on record and break­ing up sup­ply chains around the world.</p>
    <p>While a strong euro zone re­bound is un­der way as lock­down re­stric­tions have been eased and busi­nesses reopened, France and Spain, among oth­ers in the 19-mem­ber bloc, are grap­pling with a virus resur­gence.</p>
    <p>That is rais­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of re­newed re­stric­tions and lock­downs.</p>
    <p>“A flar­ing i n the num­ber of Covid-19 in­fec­tions over the sum­mer months has made it very clear that if there is no ef­fec­tive vac­cine, growth will be hand­i­capped,” said ING chief econ­o­mist Peter Van­den Houte.</p>
    <p>“There is also the fear of neg­a­tive sec­ond-round ef­fects once the cur­rent re­ces­sion starts to be re­flected in a swelling num­ber of the un­em­ployed... (and) we can­not ex­clude higher pre­cau­tion­ary sav­ings damp­en­ing con­sump­tion.”</p>
    <p>A re­turn to where the econ­omy was be­fore the out­break ear­lier this year is not ex­pected un­til at least end-2022.</p>
    <p>That comes de­spite the Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank’s (ECB) planned €1.35 tril­lion (S$2.2 tril­lion) of pan­demi­cre­lated ad­di­tional as­set pur­chases and a his­toric €750 bil­lion re­cov­ery fund from the Euro­pean Union due to kick in next year.</p>
    <p>But the con­cern is that no new stim­u­lus is on the hori­zon, other than na­tional gov­ern­ments ex­tend­ing worker fur­loughs put in place early this year as they strug­gle with soar­ing debt.</p>
    <p>Euro zone un­em­ploy­ment, which fi­nally de­clined just be­fore the coro­n­avirus struck to where it was be­fore the last fi­nan­cial cri­sis more than a decade ago, is al­ready ris­ing.</p>
    <p>Ninety per cent of econ­o­mists, or 37 of 41 who re­sponded to an ad­di­tional ques­tion in the Sept 15 to 17 Reuters poll, said a fur­ther surge in in­fec­tions was the big­gest risk to</p>
    <p>the euro zone econ­omy over the com­ing year.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing hand­ful of re­spon­dents cited a strong euro, and no trade deal reached be­tween the EU and Bri­tain when the Brexit tran­si­tion pe­riod ex­pires at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>The Reuters poll of over 80 econ­o­mists pointed to 8.1 per cent quar­terly growth this quar­ter, by far the strong­est on record, fol­low­ing a his</p>
    <p>toric 11.8 per cent con­trac­tion in the sec­ond quar­ter. That fore­cast was un­changed from last month’s poll.</p>
    <p>Quar­ter-on-quar­ter growth is then set to slow sharply to a still­strong 2.5 per cent in the fourth quar­ter, but down from the 3 per cent pre­dicted last month.</p>
    <p>In a worst-case sce­nario, the econ­omy was fore­cast to grow 4.5 per cent in the third quar­ter, com­pared to 4 per cent in the last poll. The</p>
    <p>worst case for the fourth quar­ter is now just a 0.4 per cent con­trac­tion, ver­sus a 2 per cent fall in the Au­gust poll.</p>
    <p>But over 80 per cent of re­spon­dents said the risks to both their euro zone growth and in­fla­tion fore­casts were skewed more to the down­side over the com­ing year.</p>
    <p>“The virus is mak­ing new waves and the econ­omy is still far from op­er­at­ing at pre-Covid-19 lev­els in</p>
    <p>most sec­tors,” said Mr El­win de Groot, head of macro strat­egy at Rabobank, who ex­pects no growth in the fi­nal three months of this year.</p>
    <p>“But as gov­ern­ments are likely to shift to­wards more tar­geted mea­sures – rather than blan­ket ones – the ‘true’ eco­nomic damage may re­veal it­self only in the next quar­ters.”</p>
    <p>Most econ­o­mists have re­mained pes­simistic about the bloc’s growth out­look since the pan­demic struck,</p>
    <p>and some have low­ered their in­fla­tion views even fur­ther from last month.</p>
    <p>The con­sen­sus for this quar­ter was 0.1 per cent ver­sus 0.3 per cent pre­dicted a month ago, fol­lowed by stag­na­tion the next quar­ter. On a full-year ba­sis, re­sults were broadly in line with the ECB’s staff pro­jec­tions, at 0.4 per cent for this year, 1 per cent for next year and 1.3 per cent for 2022.</p>
