    <p>Like many in­dus­tries, the lux­ury watch sec­tor has been bat­tered and bruised by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Lock­downs, bor­der clo­sures and travel bans have dealt it a big blow to the gut. Or­gan­is­ers were forced to cancel two of the world’s big­gest watch fairs: Basel­world and Watches & Won­ders Geneva.</p>
    <p>Some watch brands closed fac­to­ries and halted pro­duc­tion. Oth­ers fur­loughed their work­ers. Swatch trimmed its net­work of shops and cut 2,400 jobs, one of the most bru­tal culling ex­er­cises it has car­ried out.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent state­ment, the Fed­er­a­tion of the Swiss Watch In­dus­try (FH) warned of a mar­ket con­trac­tion of around 30 per cent for this year. Com­pared with last year, watch ex­ports in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year fell by nearly 62 per cent.</p>
    <p>Re­cov­ery, the FH added, would be a medium- or even long-term process. How­ever, the in­dus­try is hope­ful that things will get bet­ter as more coun­tries cau­tiously ease travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Re­tail sales data for June this year, re­leased by the Sin­ga­pore Depart­ment of Statis­tics a cou­ple of days ago, showed that while the watches and jew­ellery sec­tor is down 53.5 per­cent com­pared with June last year, it went up 1,236.9 per cent com­pared with May this year.</p>
    <p>Watch­mak­ers are also not rest­ing on their lau­rels. Geneva Watch Days, for in­stance, will be held from Aug 26 to 29, an initiative or­gan­ised by 17 brands in­clud­ing Bvl­gari, Bre­itling and Ulysse Nardin.</p>
    <p>This will be fol­lowed by Watches & Won­ders in Shang­hai from Sept 9 to 13. Held at the city’s West Bund Art Cen­tre, the by-in­vi­ta­tion-only event hopes to draw me­dia play­ers, re­tail­ers and clients and will fea­ture talks, work­shops and show­cases.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, there ap­pears to be no let-up in the num­ber of new re­leases by watch brands. Here are five no­table re­cent re­leases.</p>
    <p>1 AUDEMARS PIGUET ROYAL OAK OFF­SHORE SELF-WIND­ING CHRONO­GRAPH</p>
    <p>Al­ready avail­able in var­i­ous hues, the sporty Royal Oak Off­shore Self-wind­ing Chrono­graph gets three colour­ful new it­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Each model boasts a new dial de­sign, black ceramic case and tex­tured rub­ber strap. Avail­able in smoked blue, green (above) and grey, each of the dials in­cor­po­rates the waf­fle-tex­tured “Mega Tapis­serie” pat­tern and has new Ara­bic nu­mer­als in­stead of the tra­di­tional ba­ton in­dexes.</p>
    <p>Pow­ered by the Cal­iber 3126/3840, the 44mm-sized watches are wa­ter­re­sis­tant to 100m.</p>
    <p>2 TU­DOR BLACK BAY 58 NAVY BLUE</p>
    <p>When it was re­leased two years ago, the 39mm Tu­dor Black Bay 58 be­came an in­stant ob­ject of lust.</p>
    <p>This new model is equally, if not even more, cov­etable – with a dial and bezel in a glo­ri­ous shade of blue.</p>
    <p>It is a lov­ing throw­back to the aes­thetic hall­mark known as Tu­dor Blue, which started when the brand launched a diver’s watch with a blue dial and bezel in 1969. This navy blue liv­ery was adopted by the French for its Tu­dor dive watches in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>Wa­ter-re­sis­tant to 200m with 70 hours of power re­serve, this new time­piece sits lightly and beau­ti­fully on the wrist. It is es­pe­cially fetch­ing when paired with a sil­ver­striped blue fab­ric strap.</p>
    <p>3 TAG HEUER CAR­RERA 160 YEARS MON­TREAL LIMITED EDI­TION</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, the brand launched the Tag Heuer Car­rera 160 Years Sil­ver Dial Limited Edi­tion to com­mem­o­rate its 160th an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>It is con­tin­u­ing the cel­e­bra­tion with a sec­ond col­lec­tor’s edi­tion: the Tag Heuer Car­rera 160 Years Mon­treal Limited Edi­tion. “Mon­treal” refers to a col­lec­tion of Heuer au­to­matic chrono­graphs launched in 1972.</p>
    <p>The bright colour pal­ette of red, blue and yel­low on the dial is pleas­ingly retro. The heart of this 39mm beauty is the Heuer Cal­i­bre Heuer 02 man­u­fac­ture move­ment with 80 hours of power re­serve.</p>
    <p>Limited to 1,000 pieces, the watch is paired with a strik­ing blue al­li­ga­tor leather strap with fold­ing clasp and dou­ble safety push-but­tons.</p>
    <p>4 ZENITH CHRONOMAST­ER RE­VIVAL ‘SHADOW’</p>
    <p>Last year, the Zenith team stum­bled upon a black box on its premises which con­tained the pro­to­type of an oft-talked about, but rarely seen, black chrono­graph.</p>
    <p>Pro­duced in 1970, not long af­ter the brand de­buted its ground­break­ing El Primero cal­i­bre, the model was never of­fi­cially pro­duced or com­mer­cialised.</p>
    <p>In­stead of a re­pro­duc­tion, the Chronomast­er Re­vival Shadow is a sleek reimag­i­na­tion of the pro­toype. The 37mm watch is fash­ioned from mi­crob­lasted ti­ta­nium, which ac­cen­tu­ates the metal’s dark grey nu­ances.</p>
    <p>The man­ual-wind­ing chrono­graph move­ment of the orig­i­nal has also been re­placed with the El Primero move­ment. The watch – boast­ing Su­perLu­mi­nova hands and ap­plied mark­ers which glow green in the dark – is paired with a tex­tured black rub­ber strap.</p>
    <p>5 HUBLOT BIG BANG UNICO SKY BLUE</p>
    <p>It has been a colour­ful time for Hublot, with the brand trot­ting out mod­els in black, turquoise and “mil­len­nial pink” in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Lev­er­ag­ing its forte with coloured ceramic, the brand’s lat­est re­lease is in a sum­mery shade of pow­der blue (above). The Big Bang Unico Sky Blue boasts a case and bezel made of pol­ished, satin-fin­ished light blue ceramic, and a skele­ton dial in a matte blue colour scheme.</p>
    <p>The 45mm time­piece is paired with a white fab­ric strap. The look may be ca­sual, but the ma­chin­ery is not. The watch is pow­ered by the HUB1242 Unico Man­u­fac­ture self­wind­ing chrono­graph fly­back move­ment, which boasts a col­umn wheel and 72 hours of power re­serve.</p>
