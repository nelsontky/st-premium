    <p>Ac­tor Qi Yuwu is not l ook­ing for­ward to film­ing the su­per­nat­u­ral scenes i n the horror-ad­ven­ture drama The Fer­ry­man – Leg­ends Of Nanyang.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old, who does not even dare to watch horror movies, says in a tele­phone in­ter­view with lo­cal me­dia: “I’m go­ing to pre­tend we are in a long Hal­loween party, be­cause I’m scared I will not be able to fall asleep af­ter the horror scenes.”</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing from Malaysia, where the se­ries re­cently be­gan film­ing.</p>
    <p>The Fer­ry­man is be­lieved to be the first drama se­ries with heavy su­per­nat­u­ral el­e­ments for Qi, who had a sup­port­ing role in MalaysianH­ong Kong horror film Walk With Me last year.</p>
    <p>De­spite his aver­sion to horror, he took on the role due to his fa­mil­iar­ity with pro­ducer Yeo Saik Pin, for­merly from Me­di­a­corp.</p>
    <p>Yeo helmed the pro­duc­tion of Qi’s early hit drama The Cham­pion (2004).</p>
    <p>“I al­ways wanted to work with Mr Yeo again, so when he asked me to go over to Malaysia for this se­ries, I agreed,” Qi says.</p>
    <p>Hope­fully, his co-stars – Malaysia-born Lawrence Wong of Story Of Yanxi Palace (2018) and rookie Tai­wanese ac­tress Kate Kin­ney – will fare bet­ter with the su­per­nat­u­ral sto­ry­line.</p>
    <p>Wong, 38, says: “I’m the only one out of the three of us who ac­tu­ally watches horror films. I like the thrills.</p>
    <p>“But our se­ries also touches on themes like friend­ship, ro­mance and fam­ily, so it’s more than just the su­per­nat­u­ral el­e­ments.”</p>
    <p>Kin­ney, 19, says: “I have a lot of scenes where I have to get scared, but I think it should be okay even though I’m not that dar­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Fer­ry­man is a re­make of the pop­u­lar Chi­nese Web drama se­ries</p>
    <p>Soul Ferry (2014 to 2016), reimag­ined in a Sin­ga­pore­anMalaysia­n con­text.</p>
    <p>The story fol­lows a man, played by Wong, who has the abil­ity to see ghosts and spir­its. He starts work at a con­ve­nience store that seems nor­mal in the day, but at night be­comes the gate­way be­tween the mor­tal world and nether­world.</p>
    <p>The se­ries, which is set to air next year on Chi­nese stream­ing plat­form iQiyi, will also star fa­mil­iar lo­cal names such as Tay Ping Hui, Jeanette Aw and Ter­ence Cao.</p>
    <p>Kin­ney, whose father is Amer­i­can and mother is Tai­wanese, has waited months for film­ing to start.</p>
    <p>She ar­rived in Jo­hor Baru from the United States in March, when shoot­ing was slated to be­gin. But the Malaysian move­ment con­trol or­der, which started on March 18, stalled pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Wong and Qi ar­rived in Malaysia last month and served their 14-day quar­an­tine or­der be­fore the se­ries be­gan shoot­ing.</p>
    <p>Now that the trio are fi­nally to­gether, Wong – a JB na­tive – has plans to take them out.</p>
    <p>“I heard Le­goland is quite fun,” he says with a laugh.</p>
