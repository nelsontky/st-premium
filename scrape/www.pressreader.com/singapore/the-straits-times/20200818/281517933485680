    <p>De­spite the re­ces­sion, sec­tors such as bio­med­i­cal sciences, fi­nan­cial ser­vices, and in­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tions and tech­nol­ogy con­tinue to need more work­ers, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The health­care and long-term care sec­tors are also hir­ing. Like­wise, some com­pa­nies in food and bev­er­age man­u­fac­tur­ing are grow­ing and in­no­vat­ing.</p>
    <p>To sup­port firms to in­crease their head­count of lo­cal work­ers over the next six months, in­clud­ing in growth sec­tors, the Govern­ment is launch­ing a new $1 bil­lion Jobs Growth In­cen­tive pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>It will see the Govern­ment co-pay­ing up to 25 per cent of the salaries of new lo­cal hires for one year. The co-payment in­creases to a max­i­mum of 50 per cent for work­ers aged 40 and older, sub­ject to a cap.</p>
    <p>The move fol­lows through on the spe­cial at­ten­tion that has been paid to mid­dle-aged and ma­ture work­ers dur­ing this pan­demic, many of whom would ben­e­fit from re­train­ing and up­skilling.</p>
    <p>This group also jug­gles mul­ti­ple per­sonal com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Finance Min­is­ter, stresses the need for busi­nesses to trans­form, even as he noted that start-ups are also con­tribut­ing to eco­nomic growth and ef­forts against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>To fur­ther spur in­no­va­tion and en­trepreneur­ship, $150 mil­lion will be set aside to en­hance the Startup SG Founder pro­gramme in phases.</p>
    <p>“We will raise the start-up cap­i­tal grant and con­tinue to pro­vide men­tor­ship,” Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme is for first-time en­trepreneur­s with in­no­va­tive busi­ness ideas.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try will pro­vide more details later this week.</p>
