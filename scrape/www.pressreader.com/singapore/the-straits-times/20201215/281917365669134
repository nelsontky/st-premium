    <p>My fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans, we are com­ing to a full year since our first Covid-19 case. It has been a year of un­cer­tainty, full of ups and downs, filled with anx­i­ety and trep­i­da­tion.</p>
    <p>But much has changed within the last few months. In March and April, we peaked at over 1,000 cases a day. Now on most days, we have zero cases of lo­cal trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>When the pan­demic first started, we wor­ried if there would be enough sup­plies in the su­per­mar­kets. To­day, su­per­mar­ket shelves are full, and shop­ping is calm and un­event­ful.</p>
    <p>Par­ents were wor­ried then whether their kids should go to school. But we kept the school year in­tact, CCAs have re­sumed, and grad­u­at­ing stu­dents have fin­ished ex­ams and are wait­ing for their re­sults.</p>
    <p>We will not for­get the two months of cir­cuit breaker in April and May. But to­day, life is a lot more nor­mal. We go to work, dine out, and meet friends, though in groups of no more than five.</p>
    <p>How did we bring things un­der con­trol? It took a tremen­dous ef­fort, and some good luck.</p>
    <p>Our mea­sures were hard for ev­ery­one, but they worked. Sin­ga­pore­ans showed re­silience and took them in their stride.</p>
    <p>Our econ­omy took a big hit, but we did not let it crash. De­spite the global eco­nomic dis­lo­ca­tion, most of our work­ers kept their jobs.</p>
    <p>Now, our de­fences against Covid-19 are much stronger.</p>
    <p>We have steadily built up our test­ing ca­pac­i­ties and pro­ce­dures. We in­tro­duced ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of higher risk groups. We started us­ing anti­gen rapid tests, to re­sume larger gath­er­ings and events safely.</p>
    <p>We also beefed up our con­tact trac­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties – for ex­am­ple, ex­pand­ing our SafeEn­try and TraceTo­gether pro­grammes, and dis­tribut­ing TraceTo­gether to­kens.</p>
    <p>We got used to the in­con­ve­nient re­stric­tions, and found ways to carry on with life. We looked af­ter one an­other, re­mind­ing each other to ad­here to safe dis­tanc­ing, to wear masks, to see a doc­tor if ill, and so on.</p>
    <p>I am very grate­ful that Sin­ga­pore­ans have com­plied with the spirit, and not just the let­ter of the rules.</p>
    <p>We stayed united, kept up our guard, and did not al­low our­selves to be­come com­pla­cent over time.</p>
    <p>With ev­ery­one’s full sup­port, our en­hanced safe­guards worked, and we could grad­u­ally ease our re­stric­tions. We can be proud of how far we have come.</p>
    <p>ROUTE TO PHASE THREE</p>
    <p>Be­cause of your ef­forts, we are now ready to progress to the next phase.</p>
    <p>Phase three will be­gin in two weeks’ time, on Dec 28, so we will end the year with some good news.</p>
    <p>The min­is­te­rial task force will ex­plain the de­tails im­me­di­ately af­ter my broad­cast.</p>
    <p>We will ease ca­pac­ity lim­its in pub­lic places like malls and at­trac­tions, and at places of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>One sig­nif­i­cant change is to al­low groups of up to eight to con­gre­gate, up from the cur­rent max­i­mum of five.</p>
    <p>So eight peo­ple can dine out to­gether, or visit some­one’s home.</p>
    <p>This will make it eas­ier to hold fam­ily get-to­geth­ers dur­ing the fes­tive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Please un­der­stand that even as we en­ter phase three, the bat­tle is far from won. The Covid-19 virus has not been erad­i­cated. There is a long way to go.</p>
    <p>Around the world, the pan­demic is still rag­ing. Many coun­tries are see­ing sec­ond, third, or even fourth waves of in­fec­tion, with record num­bers of daily cases.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional bor­ders re­main largely closed. But trade and travel are our lifeblood.</p>
    <p>The longer our own bor­ders stay closed to trav­ellers, the greater the risk of us per­ma­nently los­ing out as an in­ter­na­tional hub, and con­se­quently hurt­ing our liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>There­fore, our only op­tion is to re­open our bor­ders in a con­trolled and safe man­ner.</p>
    <p>As we do so, we will see more im­ported cases. And there will be some risk of th­ese im­ported cases spread­ing to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>We have al­ready had a few cases re­cently: An air­port staff, who likely came into con­tact with in­fected pas­sen­gers. A marine worker, who picked up the virus af­ter board­ing ships to do re­pair and re­sup­ply work.</p>
    <p>This is a cal­cu­lated risk we have to ac­cept. But the Gov­ern­ment will take ev­ery pre­cau­tion, and do our best to pre­vent im­ported cases from trig­ger­ing a new out­break.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Sin­ga­pore­ans must keep our guard up, be­cause the virus is most likely still cir­cu­lat­ing silently within our com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Each of us needs to play our part. By all means make use of the higher lim­its and re­con­nect with friends and fam­ily. But please do not aban­don your mind­set of watch­ful­ness and cau­tion.</p>
    <p>This is ab­so­lutely not the time to re­lax, and let our guard down. Or to hold a big party, imag­in­ing that the prob­lem has dis­ap­peared.</p>
    <p>Pro­gress­ing from phase two to phase three is a cal­i­brated, care­ful move. We are eas­ing the re­stric­tions in a con­trolled way, so that we can keep the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion sta­ble, and take more steps for­ward later.</p>
    <p>It is vi­tal that you stay cau­tious and vig­i­lant, con­tinue to co­op­er­ate with the Gov­ern­ment, and com­ply with the rules and re­stric­tions that will ap­ply in phase three.</p>
    <p>UP­DATE ON VAC­CI­NA­TIONS</p>
    <p>How long will we have to keep this up for? It may be for quite a while, pos­si­bly a year or more. One key fac­tor is how soon Covid-19 vac­cines be­come avail­able to us.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has been work­ing qui­etly be­hind the scenes, since early in the pan­demic, to se­cure ac­cess to vac­cines.</p>
    <p>This was not a sim­ple ex­er­cise. More than 200 vaccine can­di­dates were be­ing de­vel­oped, and not all would suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>We started talk­ing to the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies early to un­der­stand the science, and iden­tify the promis­ing can­di­date vac­cines likely to reach pro­duc­tion soon.</p>
    <p>We set aside more than US$1 bil­lion (S$1.33 bil­lion). We placed mul­ti­ple bets, to sign ad­vance pur­chase agree­ments and make early down pay­ments for the most promis­ing can­di­dates, in­clud­ing with Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Si­no­vac.</p>
    <p>We made ar­range­ments with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies to fa­cil­i­tate their clin­i­cal tri­als and drug devel­op­ment in Singapore, and at­tracted a few to es­tab­lish vaccine man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties here.</p>
    <p>We also sup­ported lo­cal ef­forts to de­velop a vaccine. This gave our own sci­en­tists and re­searchers the op­por­tu­nity to do cut­ting edge work. It was also in­surance, in case the global sup­ply chain was dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>This way, we built up a di­ver­si­fied port­fo­lio of op­tions, to en­sure that Singapore would be near the front of the queue for vac­cines, and not last in line.</p>
    <p>Se­cur­ing early ac­cess to vac­cines was a whole-of-gov­ern­ment ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Many agen­cies and pub­lic of­fi­cers, led by the head of the Civil Ser­vice, were in­volved in this crit­i­cal mis­sion.</p>
    <p>I com­mend them for their good work. They are among the le­gion of un­sung he­roes who have helped us get through this cri­sis.</p>
    <p>As you would have read in the news, the first vac­cines are now com­ing into pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>I am very happy to tell you that af­ter study­ing the sci­en­tific ev­i­dence and clin­i­cal trial data, the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity has ap­proved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for pan­demic use.</p>
    <p>The first ship­ment should ar­rive by the end of this month, mak­ing Singapore one of the first coun­tries to ob­tain this vaccine.</p>
    <p>We also ex­pect other vac­cines to ar­rive in Singapore in the com­ing months. If all goes ac­cord­ing to plan, we will have enough vac­cines for ev­ery­one in Singapore by third quar­ter 2021.</p>
    <p>MOH has set up a com­mit­tee of doc­tors and ex­perts to rec­om­mend a vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy for us. The com­mit­tee has pro­posed that our en­tire adult pop­u­la­tion should be vac­ci­nated, but to make vac­ci­na­tions vol­un­tary.</p>
    <p>First pri­or­ity will be given to those who are at great­est risk: healthcare work­ers and front-line per­son­nel, as well as the elderly and vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>There­after, the com­mit­tee pro­poses to pro­gres­sively vac­ci­nate the rest of the pop­u­la­tion, and to cover ev­ery­one who wants a vac­ci­na­tion by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has ac­cepted th­ese rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>I have per­sonal con­fi­dence in our ex­perts. My Cab­i­net col­leagues and I, in­clud­ing the older ones, will be get­ting our­selves vac­ci­nated early. This is to show you, espe­cially se­niors like me, that we be­lieve the vac­cines are safe.</p>
    <p>We have de­cided to make vac­ci­na­tions free for all Sin­ga­pore­ans, and for all long-term res­i­dents who are cur­rently here.</p>
    <p>So I strongly en­cour­age you to get vac­ci­nated too, when the vaccine is of­fered to you.</p>
    <p>Be­cause when you get your­self vac­ci­nated, you are not just pro­tect­ing your­self, you are also do­ing your part to pro­tect oth­ers, espe­cially your loved ones.</p>
    <p>The more of us are vac­ci­nated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will all be as a so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines will sup­port our re­cov­ery in more ways than one.</p>
    <p>As a global avi­a­tion hub, we play a cru­cial role trans­port­ing vac­cines around the world. Vac­cines re­quire cold chain man­age­ment. An or­di­nary re­frig­er­a­tor is not good enough: The Pfizer vaccine needs to be stored at mi­nus 70 deg C, colder than the Arc­tic in win­ter!</p>
    <p>This re­quires in­fras­truc­ture, high stan­dards, skilled per­son­nel, and good con­nec­tiv­ity to many dif­fer­ent coun­tries all along the sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, Singapore has a strong ecosys­tem for cargo han­dling. Lead­ing global lo­gis­tics com­pa­nies like DHL, UPS and FedEx are based here. SIA, and Changi Air­port’s ground han­dling part­ners are cer­ti­fied by Iata (the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion) to han­dle and trans­port phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal sup­plies.</p>
    <p>We are now gear­ing our­selves up to han­dle large vol­umes of vaccine ship­ments into and through Singapore, to help win the global fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>We did not get here overnight. We have al­ways planned ahead, sys­tem­at­i­cally cre­at­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for our­selves.</p>
    <p>It took us years of in­vest­ment and plan­ning, build­ing a busi­ness friendly cli­mate and ex­pand­ing our air links around the world. Th­ese long-term in­vest­ments are now pay­ing div­i­dends.</p>
    <p>If all goes ac­cord­ing to plan, we will have enough vac­cines for ev­ery­one in Singapore by third quar­ter 2021. MOH has set up a com­mit­tee of doc­tors and ex­perts to rec­om­mend a vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy for us. The com­mit­tee has pro­posed that our en­tire adult pop­u­la­tion should be vac­ci­nated, but to make vac­ci­na­tions vol­un­tary.</p>
    <p>CON­CLU­SION</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this im­me­di­ate cri­sis, we have re­acted quickly and com­pre­hen­sively, mar­shalled re­sources to solve our prob­lems, and stayed re­silient.</p>
    <p>Our sit­u­a­tion is now sta­ble, but only be­cause ev­ery­one has worked so hard, and sac­ri­ficed so much. Now that vac­cines are be­com­ing avail­able, we can see light at the end of the tun­nel.</p>
    <p>As vac­ci­na­tions be­come wide­spread not only in Singapore, but also in our re­gion and the world, we can look for­ward to re­sum­ing more nor­mal lives.</p>
    <p>Let us keep up our ef­forts in this fi­nal stretch, to cross the fin­ish line to­gether, and com­plete our mis­sion to de­feat Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Thank you.</p>
    <p>(This should be) paid work for so­cial work­ers. They can be ac­com­pa­nied by some­one with a med­i­cal back­ground, like a nurse. Per­fect for grad­u­ates of so­cial sciences. (Pay them) a proper salary for mo­ti­va­tion, too.</p>

    <p>How about Pi­o­neer Gen­er­a­tion am­bas­sadors? Looks bet­ter than po­lice knock­ing on your door. Ivan Lau</p>
    <p>The po­lice have lots of more im­por­tant tasks on hand. How about get­ting a few vol­un­teers in ev­ery block to do visits? I don’t mind be­ing a vol­un­teer for my block.</p>
