    <p>As with con­ven­tional bi­cy­cles, it takes time to ac­quire the skills to ride a fixed-gear bi­cy­cle pro­fi­ciently and safely. Be­gin­ners, es­pe­cially younger learn­ers, should al­ways ride un­der su­per­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>A LAND TRANS­PORT AU­THOR­ITY SPOKESMAN</p>
    <p>The Ac­tive Mo­bil­ity Ad­vi­sory Panel will look into whether brakes should be re­quired for bi­cy­cles, fol­low­ing the death of a young girl who was riding her friend’s fixedgear bike in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Fixed-gear bi­cy­cles gen­er­ally do not have hand-op­er­ated brakes, and rely on the rider’s pedal re­sis­tance to come to a halt.</p>
    <p>They are banned or face re­stricted use in a num­ber of coun­tries, in­clud­ing Den­mark, the Nether­lands, Ger­many and the</p>
    <p>United King­dom.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Trans­port Baey Yam Keng told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the panel will con­duct the re­view, which aims to “strike a bal­ance be­tween all stake­hold­ers”.</p>
    <p>“We will look at how other coun­tries are reg­u­lat­ing this, ex­am­ine safety fac­tors, and get in­puts from users,” he said.</p>
    <p>On Jan 8, a 13-year-old fell to her death af­ter she col­lided with a metal rail­ing at a multi-storey carpark in Pasir Ris.</p>
    <p>A novice cy­clist, she was riding her friend’s fixed-gear bi­cy­cle down the ramp when it hap­pened.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the in­ci­dent, Mr</p>
    <p>Baey said “we cer­tainly do not want more ca­su­al­ties”, but added that the re­view will take a bal­anced ap­proach. It is ex­pected to be com­pleted by later this year.</p>
    <p>When asked for com­ments, the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) said reg­u­la­tions on bi­cy­cle brakes are var­ied in many coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“As with con­ven­tional bi­cy­cles, it takes time to ac­quire the skills to ride a fixed-gear bi­cy­cle pro­fi­ciently and safely,” said an LTA spokesman.</p>
    <p>“Be­gin­ners, es­pe­cially younger learn­ers, should al­ways ride un­der su­per­vi­sion.”</p>
    <p>She noted that all bi­cy­cles, in­clud­ing fixed-gear mod­els, used on pub­lic paths must not be wider than 70cm and can weigh no more than 20kg.</p>
    <p>In a Fo­rum l et­ter ear­lier this week, Straits Times reader Ed­mond Lim raised con­cern about bi­cy­cles with­out brakes. “Fixed-gear riding has at­tained some sort of a cult sta­tus or cool im­age in Singa</p>
    <p>pore,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“While laws in Singapore govern a num­ber of as­pects for cy­cling, I am quite sur­prised that there are no spe­cific reg­u­la­tions on bi­cy­cles with no front brakes or on those us­ing back-pedal brakes.”</p>
    <p>Cy­clist Nigel Ng, 47, said fixedgear bi­cy­cles are un­com­pli­cated and cheap, mak­ing them pop­u­lar with many rid­ers.</p>
    <p>Al­though he does not ride a fixedgear bi­cy­cle, Mr Ng, who works in a bi­cy­cle shop, as­serts that such bikes are not nec­es­sar­ily un­safe.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent types of bi­cy­cles have their own way of stop­ping, he said.</p>
    <p>But asked which type stops more ef­fec­tively – fixed-gear or con­ven­tional bikes with brakes – he said “it is hard to say”.</p>
    <p>Prod­uct de­signer Woon Tai­woon, an avid cy­clist, said he knows many fixed-gear cy­clists who are re­spon­si­ble rid­ers, but there are also those who are not.</p>
    <p>Mr Woon, 46, said that “young and im­pres­sion­able peo­ple” may have been in­flu­enced by Pre­mium Rush, a 2012 movie on the an­tics of New York courier rid­ers on fixedgear bi­cy­cles.</p>
    <p>But he said that in­stead of ban­ning a cer­tain type of bi­cy­cles, it would be more ef­fec­tive to in­cul­cate safe riding habits in chil­dren, so that if they de­cide to grad­u­ate to more chal­leng­ing bi­cy­cles, such as fixed-gear mod­els, they will not be a dan­ger to them­selves or oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, you have to be con­sid­er­ate,” said Mr Woon. “We are a very small coun­try.”</p>
