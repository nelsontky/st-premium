    <p>Five se­nior po­lice of­fi­cers in In­dia have been sus­pended over their han­dling of an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the gang rape and mur­der of a 19-year-old woman that has sparked ou­trage across the coun­try and trig­gered days of protests.</p>
    <p>The se­ri­ously in­jured teenager from the dis­ad­van­taged Dalit caste was found in the mid­dle of last month out­side her vil­lage in north­ern In­dia’s Ut­tar Pradesh state and died ear­lier last week in a New Delhi hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The po­lice have ar­rested four high-caste men on charges of gang rape and mur­der. But the po­lice have faced crit­i­cism for cre­mat­ing the woman’s body in the mid­dle of the night – re­port­edly with the help of some petrol – against the wishes of her fam­ily and re­li­gious cus­tom.</p>
    <p>A se­nior po­lice­man on Thurs­day sparked fur­ther ou­trage after claim­ing that a foren­sic re­port and an au­topsy had shown that the woman had not been raped.</p>
    <p>This con­tra­dicts state­ments from the vic­tim and her mother and re­ported hos­pi­tal find­ings, while ex­perts said the foren­sic test was car­ried out too long after the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of po­lice have also bar­ri­caded the vil­lage, pre­vent­ing the woman’s fam­ily from leav­ing and jour­nal­ists and op­po­si­tion politi­cians from talk­ing to them. The fam­ily’s mo­bile phones have also re­port­edly been seized.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim’s brother told one In­dian news chan­nel that his fam­ily mem­bers were scared for their lives. The lo­cal high court has or­dered the au­thor­i­ties to pro­vide the fam­ily with pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ut­tar Pradesh Chief Min­is­ter Yogi Adityanath late on Fri­day an­nounced the sus­pen­sion of the</p>
    <p>Hathras district po­lice chief and four other of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Mr Yogi, a close ally of Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi, also an­nounced that the vic­tim’s fam­ily, the ac­cused and the sus­pended po­lice­men would all un­dergo lie-de­tec­tor and drug tests.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day evening, in the lat­est protest, around 500 peo­ple, in­clud­ing Delhi’s chief min­is­ter and a prom­i­nent Dalit politi­cian, gath­ered in the In­dian cap­i­tal de­mand­ing justice.</p>
    <p>“We (women) are not ac­tu­ally free, even though In­dia is in­de­pen­dent,” Ms San­skriti, one of the women at the Delhi protest site said. “This is some­thing I want to raise my voice against. And I just wish all the peo­ple get united and they un­der­stand that it is high time to do some­thing about it,” she added.</p>
