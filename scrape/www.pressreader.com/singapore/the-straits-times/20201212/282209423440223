    <p>The tem­ple “can­not rely on that which it has not pleaded, and it must be made to bear the con­se­quences of its own er­rors”, said Jus­tice Choo. He said this was “un­for­tu­nate” be­cause the Teochew tem­ple may have suc­ceeded if the rel­e­vant facts had been pleaded and proved at the trial.</p>
    <p>A tem­ple that sued an­other tem­ple in the same com­pound for ob­struct­ing its an­nual re­li­gious cel­e­bra­tions has lost its case in the High Court.</p>
    <p>The le­gal spat cen­tred on a 2011 agree­ment be­tween Tuan Kong Beo (Teochew) Tem­ple and Tian Kong Bud­dhist Tem­ple over the use of their joint premises in Be­dok North.</p>
    <p>A dis­trict judge had ear­lier con­cluded that the agree­ment was legally bind­ing and ruled in favour of the Teochew tem­ple. But Jus­tice Choo Han Teck over­turned the de­ci­sion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In a writ­ten judg­ment, he said the dis­trict judge was wrong to have de­cided the case based on a par­tic­u­lar le­gal doc­trine that was not put for­ward in the Teochew tem­ple’s law­suit.</p>
    <p>The tem­ple “can­not rely on that which it has not pleaded, and it must be made to bear the con­se­quences of its own er­rors”, said Jus­tice Choo. He said this was “un­for­tu­nate” be­cause the Teochew tem­ple may have suc­ceeded if the rel­e­vant facts had been pleaded and proved at the trial.</p>
    <p>How­ever, or­der­ing a re­trial would en­ti­tle the Teochew tem­ple to have a sec­ond at­tempt, which would be “grossly un­fair” to the other side. “If this were al­lowed, the courts would be in­un­dated with fresh tri­als by failed lit­i­gants,” the judge added.</p>
    <p>The two tem­ples op­er­ated on Pu­lau Tekong un­til the 1980s, when the Gov­ern­ment re­set­tled res­i­dents to the main­land.</p>
    <p>Both tem­ples re­ceived com­pen­sa­tion and were al­lo­cated a piece of land to al­low devo­tees to con­tinue to wor­ship, but dis­agree­ments over the use of the premises sur­faced in 2016.</p>
    <p>The Teochew tem­ple filed a law­suit in 2018, ar­gu­ing that the Tian Kong Bud­dhist Tem­ple had pre­vented it from hold­ing im­por­tant events at the premises.</p>
    <p>It al­leged that Tian Kong chair­man Chin Tiam Soy parked his car in the area where the tent­age was to be set up for the event.</p>
    <p>It also com­plained that Mr Chin had locked the main gate to hin­der the con­trac­tor and pre­vented the use of elec­tric­ity and wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Th­ese acts forced the cel­e­bra­tions to be scaled down in 2016 and 2017 and moved to an­other lo­ca­tion al­to­gether in 2018 and last year.</p>
    <p>The Teochew tem­ple ar­gued that un­der the 2011 agree­ment, it was al­lowed to carry out th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties at the premises.</p>
    <p>Tian Kong chal­lenged the va­lid­ity of the agree­ment, ar­gu­ing that Mr Chin was not au­tho­rised by its trustees or board mem­bers to sign it.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, a dis­trict judge found that Mr Chin had “os­ten­si­ble author­ity” to sign the agree­ment and that Tian Kong was bound by it.</p>
    <p>Tian Kong ap­pealed to the High Court.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Lim Chee San ar­gued that the dis­trict judge was wrong to make a rul­ing based on the doc­trine of os­ten­si­ble author­ity when the Teochew tem­ple nei­ther pleaded this claim in its suit nor pro­duced ev­i­dence to sup­port it.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Choo agreed, not­ing that the fail­ure to plead this claim caused prej­u­dice to Tian Kong, which did not have the op­por­tu­nity to mount a re­sponse.</p>
