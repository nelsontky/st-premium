    <p>“I am try­ing to stand up again, but I am help­less,” said a choked-up Mo­hammed Af­sar Mo­hi­ud­din, break­ing down over the phone.</p>
    <p>In June, the 56-year-old had to shut down Nasr Model High School, a pri­vate in­sti­tu­tion he ran for 14 years in Hy­der­abad.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hi­ud­din was left with no other choice af­ter his school’s mainly lower mid­dle-class par­ents, whose mea­gre in­come was hit amid the coun­try­wide lock­down ear­lier this year, de­faulted on pay­ing tu­ition fees.</p>
    <p>“I have not re­ceived even a sin­gle ru­pee from them since April,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>With no in­come, he dipped into his sav­ings and bor­rowed money to keep the school go­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>But he could keep it afloat only un­til the end of June, as he caved in un­der a grow­ing debt from hav­ing to pay the monthly 44,000 ru­pee (S$800) rent for the build­ing hous­ing his school, as well as salaries for his 21 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>He now runs a poul­try shop sell­ing raw chicken to make ends meet. “I hope I can se­cure some fi­nan­cial aid. I have no skill other than teach­ing and run­ning a school, but the gov­ern­ment is not help­ing,” he rued.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hi­ud­din’s predica­ment mir­rors that of many own­ers of bud­get pri­vate schools across In­dia that have ei­ther shut down or are be­ing threat­ened with clo­sure.</p>
    <p>It is es­ti­mated that around 46 per cent of In­dia’s 251 mil­lion school­go­ing chil­dren at­tend fully pri­vate or gov­ern­ment-aided pri­vate schools, the vast ma­jor­ity of them in the bud­get cat­e­gory that charge less than 3,000 ru­pees a month.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic-in­duced plight of such schools, how­ever, re­mains ob­fus­cated by a sem­blance of nor­mal­ity that on­line school­ing has brought to the ed­u­ca­tion sec­tor.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause many poor and lower mid­dle-class fam­i­lies who rely on bud­get schools for their chil­dren’s ed­u­ca­tion can­not af­ford to buy de­vices, such as smart­phones and lap­tops, for them to at­tend on­line lessons. Most can­not even pay the monthly fees in the cur­rent cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>A National In­de­pen­dent Schools Al­liance (Nisa) sur­vey re­leased in Septem­ber found that only 38 per cent of stu­dents in the 3,690 low­cost schools polled in 22 states had paid the school fees for the</p>
    <p>April-June quar­ter.</p>
    <p>“When money is not com­ing in, how do you ex­pect th­ese schools to run?” Nisa pres­i­dent Kulb­hushan Sharma told ST.</p>
    <p>Be­sides salaries and rent, many schools have to re­pay loans taken to buy school buses and pay a min­i­mum elec­tric­ity charge that is im­posed in some cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Sharma es­ti­mates that as many as 80 per cent of low-cost pri­vate schools are on the brink of shut­ting down. One of them is his SBBM Model School in Am­bala, in the state of Haryana. The school has re­ceived only around 6 per cent of its fees for this aca­demic year that be­gan in April.</p>
    <p>Mr Sharma has kept it run­ning with per­sonal sav­ings and money from his fa­ther’s pen­sion.</p>
    <p>“If the sit­u­a­tion does not im­prove, I don’t think I can keep the school open be­yond April next year. Even run­ning my house­hold will be­come dif­fi­cult, let alone the school,” he said.</p>
    <p>Schools were shut across the coun­try in March. The gov­ern­ment al­lowed them to re­open for se­nior grades from Oct 15, but few stu­dents have re­turned as par­ents re­main wary of the coro­n­avirus spread.</p>
    <p>In the state of Te­lan­gana, the sit­u­a­tion is so bad that the Te­lan­gana Recog­nised Schools Man­age­ment As­so­ci­a­tion (TRSMA) wrote to the state gov­ern­ment in Septem­ber to tem­po­rar­ily take over the func­tion­ing of bud­get schools there.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to TRSMA gen­eral sec­re­tary Sadula Mad­husud­han, Te­lan­gana has around 11,000 pri­vate schools, of which around 9,000 are bud­get schools.</p>
    <p>“Of th­ese, around 3,000 have shut down per­ma­nently,” said Mr Mad­husud­han.</p>
    <p>His school Pra­gati Vidya Nike­tan in Hy­der­abad is among those that could close down next year.</p>
    <p>He said he has had to pawn his wife’s jew­ellery, be­sides bor­row­ing from banks and his friends, to pay for salaries and other over­head costs, as the fee col­lec­tion from par­ents has plum­meted to less than 10 per cent.</p>
    <p>He even laid off half of his teach­ers, around 30, in July to cut down his ex­penses, but still owes more than 4 mil­lion ru­pees in rent.</p>
    <p>“If things con­tinue like this, I will not be able to keep my school run­ning be­yond De­cem­ber,” he added.</p>
    <p>The cri­sis has also im­pacted teach­ers at th­ese bud­get schools, many of whom have lost their jobs in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Mr Vishnu Vard­han Reddy, a 39-year-old math­e­mat­ics teacher in Hy­der­abad, was laid off i n March af­ter work­ing for 12 years.</p>
    <p>He now earns a liv­ing col­lect­ing paint or­ders from new home own­ers, which brings in 10,000 ru­pees a month com­pared with his pre­vi­ous salary of 24,000 ru­pees. “I never ex­pected this and it has been dif­fi­cult, but I have to do it to sur­vive and feed my fam­ily,” he said.</p>
    <p>Nisa launched a 51-day “Save Ed­u­ca­tion” cam­paign in Septem­ber, call­ing for gov­ern­ment fund­ing to be paid di­rectly into the ac­counts of the stu­dents’ par­ents so that they can use it to pay school fees.</p>
    <p>“But the gov­ern­ment has not paid any at­ten­tion to this prob­lem. It has even re­fused to give con­ces­sions on wa­ter and elec­tric­ity bills,” Mr Sharma said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some state gov­ern­ments have adopted a pop­ulist stand, sup­port­ing as­so­ci­a­tions rep­re­sent­ing par­ents to pres­sure schools to cut their fees.</p>
    <p>In Ra­jasthan, for in­stance, the gov­ern­ment has asked schools to re­duce tu­ition fees by 30 per cent to 40 per cent. Last week, pri­vate schools in the state sus­pended on­line classes to draw at­ten­tion to their fi­nan­cial dis­tress caused by the non-pay­ment of fees.</p>
    <p>“If the gov­ern­ment can’t step in to sup­port pri­vate schools, it should de­clare this year to be a zero aca­demic year dur­ing which no aca­demic ac­tiv­i­ties are con­ducted,” added Mr Sharma.</p>
    <p>In the state of Te­lan­gana, the sit­u­a­tion is so bad that the Te­lan­gana Recog­nised Schools Man­age­ment As­so­ci­a­tion wrote to the state gov­ern­ment in Septem­ber to tem­po­rar­ily take over the func­tion­ing of bud­get schools there.</p>
