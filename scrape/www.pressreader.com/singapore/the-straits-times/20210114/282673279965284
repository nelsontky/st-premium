        <p>AN­DRE AND HIS OLIVE TREE</p>
        <p>PG, 104 min­utes, opens today</p>
        <p>When he picked chef An­dre Chi­ang as the sub­ject for a bi­og­ra­phy, Sin­ga­porean film-maker Josiah Ng could have ended up with a 104minute ex­er­cise in public re­la­tions.</p>
        <p>But Chi­ang’s lack of con­cern about false hu­mil­ity or self­ef­face­ment, as cap­tured in the film, gives it a much-needed touch of as­trin­gency.</p>
        <p>Af­ter tak­ing his Restau­rant An­dre to the top, the chef shocked the gas­tro­sphere by shut­ting it down in 2018 while it was still a hot ticket, re­turn­ing its two Miche­lin stars. Ng’s film fol­lows the chef, his wife Su­daram­pai “Pam” Chi­ang and staff as they go through the restau­rant’s fi­nal year.</p>
        <p>Chi­ang comes across as a prickly per­fec­tion­ist, ob­ses­sive with food, pre­sen­ta­tion and ser­vice, and a man who runs his kitchen with pa­ter­nal­is­tic stern­ness.</p>
        <p>And like a tiger dad, he grum­bles to vis­it­ing men­tor Jac­ques Pour­cel about how young ap­pren­tices do not stick around these days. They have the au­dac­ity to leave his kitchen to “make stupid muffins and mar­malade and bagels” in­stead of pay­ing their dues in a “great restau­rant”, he gripes.</p>
        <p>Here is some­one with a trait few pos­sess: He has a sense of des­tiny. In his 2016 book, Oc­taphi­los­o­phy: The Eight El­e­ments Of Restau­rant An­dre, he spells out his ap­proach to food. He also has a rest­less need to de­mol­ish his past and move on, and a burn­ing sense of mis­sion.</p>
        <p>The film is at its best when it is ob­serv­ing Chi­ang at work – judg­ing the flavour of a dish with a scowl, greet­ing guests with a grin and jug­gling book­ings with his wife.</p>
        <p>But it spends too much time with talk­ing heads. Food writ­ers and friends of­fer plat­i­tudes that un­der­line what is al­ready ob­vi­ous (for ex­am­ple, Chi­ang’s eye for de­tail), while chats with em­ploy­ees can yield only so much hon­esty.</p>
        <p>STIG­MA­TIZED PROP­ER­TIES PG13, 112 min­utes, opens today</p>
        <p>Ghost hunter re­al­ity shows are known for sev­eral things, chief among them that not one has proven the ex­is­tence of ghosts.</p>
        <p>So how you feel about this movie de­pends on how you feel about these pro­grammes, as its screen­play re-en­acts episodes from a Ja­panese haunted home se­ries.</p>
        <p>Ya­mame (Kazuya Ka­me­nashi) and Taisa (Koji Seto) are strug­gling per­form­ers who, hav­ing failed at com­edy, join the team at a tele­vi­sion va­ri­ety show. In a bid for rat­ings, Taisa sug­gests a cast mem­ber rent a “stig­ma­tised prop­erty” – a place where an un­nat­u­ral death has oc­curred – then record the events that fol­low. Ya­mame is put up for the job.</p>
        <p>Di­rec­tor Hideo Nakata helped make Asian hor­ror a global trend with films such as Ring (1998) and Dark Wa­ter (2002). But Stig­ma­tized Prop­er­ties lacks the depth and scares of his best work.</p>
        <p>The key fail­ing here is the point of view. The story makes Ya­mame the pro­tag­o­nist, so all spooks are ex­pe­ri­enced by him.</p>
        <p>He is as mud­dled a char­ac­ter as one is likely to find. To heighten the scares, he is made to be a vul­ner­a­ble, sen­si­tive sort of guy – the per­fect cow­er­ing vic­tim for the rest­less soul of a mur­dered woman, for ex­am­ple.</p>
        <p>But the story also needs him to be the sort of per­son who would take on one ghost hunter as­sign­ment af­ter another, de­spite how the last job seemed to have shaken him to the core.</p>
        <p>What made Dark Wa­ter and Ring so ef­fec­tive was that the ghoul was the co-pro­tag­o­nist as well as in­tel­li­gent and ma­li­cious. Here, the spir­its are in­tro­duced, ex­plained, then dealt with in cur­sory fash­ion. It be­comes a mon­ster hunt.</p>
        <p>Nakata’s deft touch can be seen in the sup­port­ing char­ac­ters, such as Ya­mame’s smarmy, rat­ings-driven boss, but that is not enough to lift this work.</p>
        <p>THE VIGIL</p>
        <p>NC16, 90 min­utes, opens today</p>
        <p>Spooky films are at their spook­i­est when the haunter and the haunted are fully re­alised char­ac­ters who make choices that fit with who they are and what they want.</p>
        <p>On that score, this su­perbly crafted piece of creepy min­i­mal­ism does well – it not only fits a world inside the sin­gle room of the movie, but every­thing done by the liv­ing and the dead also makes sense.</p>
        <p>Yakov (Dave Davis), a New Yorker in need of cash, takes on the job of a shomer, some­one who guards the body of a dead per­son at night as part of the Jewish fu­neral rit­ual. While he is Jewish, he is no longer a be­liever and does his best to pull away from his com­mu­nity of Ortho­dox Jews.</p>
        <p>The stage is set for dusk-to­dawn ter­ror as Yakov is as­sailed by the hor­rors of his past – the ones that caused him to re­nounce his faith – and those that haunt the woman whose body he has to watch over.</p>
        <p>Writer-di­rec­tor Keith Thomas, mak­ing his fea­ture de­but, dives into the idea that psy­cho­log­i­cal trauma, es­pe­cially those di­rected at one’s reli­gious and eth­nic iden­ti­ties, cuts so deep that it can be­come ex­ter­nalised as a malev­o­lent en­tity. It is not a new idea – for ex­am­ple, it can be said that the pon­tianak, a crea­ture com­mon to sev­eral South-east Asian cul­tures, is the em­bod­i­ment of women’s suf­fer­ing.</p>
        <p>But that de­vice is used to the fullest here. In a Brook­lyn liv­ing room draped in the black­est of shad­ows, Yakov finds tools that come to hand – his mem­ory, the tele­phone, books on the shelf, clues left here and there – to heal him­self spir­i­tu­ally so he can fight the be­ings tor­ment­ing the soul of a dead woman.</p>
        <p>Thomas uses sim­ple prac­ti­cal ef­fects, boosted by sound­track thumps, to cre­ate the odd jump scare, but what stands out is the sus­tained mood of dread. Dawn can­not come soon enough.</p>
