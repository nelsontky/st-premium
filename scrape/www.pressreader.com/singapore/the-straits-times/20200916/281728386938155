    <p>Twenty-three food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets were caught flout­ing Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures dur­ing stepped-up checks over the weekend.</p>
    <p>Many of the breaches in­volved groups of more than five peo­ple seated to­gether, min­gling be­tween ta­bles, or al­co­hol be­ing served and con­sumed past 10.30pm, the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The rules for phase two, which be­gan on June 19, state that groups of up to five peo­ple are per­mit­ted for so­cial gath­er­ings, but there should be no mix­ing.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) said on Aug 21 that peo­ple should re­frain from book­ing mul­ti­ple ta­bles for large gath­er­ings in F&B out­lets, and urged restau­rants not to ac­cept such reser­va­tions.</p>
    <p>It re­it­er­ated the warn­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Over the weekend, checks were car­ried out by var­i­ous agen­cies, in­clud­ing the po­lice, at 149 F&B out­lets in known hot spots.</p>
    <p>The MSE said the breaches are be­ing re­viewed and “ap­pro­pri­ate en­force­ment ac­tion will be taken, in­clud­ing tem­po­rary clo­sure of the out­lets and fines”.</p>
    <p>This comes after Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-min­istry Covid-19 task force, said last Wed­nes­day that en­force­ment agen­cies would step up checks on F&B out­lets.</p>
    <p>He noted that while most peo­ple are com­ply­ing with the rules, “there are still a few breaches that we pick up on a daily ba­sis, and they typ­i­cally hap­pen at pop­u­lar nightspots”.</p>
    <p>The breaches un­earthed dur­ing the weekend in­cluded an Orchard Road out­let that served beer in me­tal teapots to 13 cus­tomers after 11pm.</p>
    <p>Bot­tles of beer sold to cus­tomers after the 10.30pm cut-off time were con­cealed at the bottom of the fridge.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong noted last Wed­nes­day that F&B out­lets and din­ers who breach safe man­age­ment mea­sures will now be pe­nalised even for the first of­fence, in­stead of re­ceiv­ing warn­ings as had been the case.</p>
    <p>The MOH said on the same day that this would take im­me­di­ate ef­fect as there has been suf­fi­cient time for F&B out­lets and cus­tomers to ad­just to the rules.</p>
    <p>But restau­rants are still fac­ing prob­lems with din­ers try­ing to break the rules.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drew Tjioe, chief ex­ec­u­tive of TungLok Group, said cus­tomers have con­tin­ued to try to make reser­va­tions for more than five peo­ple, de­spite last week’s an­nounce­ment that checks would be stepped up.</p>
    <p>“There will al­ways be such re­quests, but our an­swer is al­ways ‘no’,” he added.</p>
    <p>He noted that TungLok has re­cently printed plac­ards that will be flashed at cus­tomers re­mind­ing them not to min­gle be­tween ta­bles, if such in­ci­dents are ob­served.</p>
    <p>Mr Yuan Oeij, owner and chair­man of The Prive Group, said his restau­rants have con­tin­ued to re­ceive re­quests for large group book­ings or for small groups that ask to be seated next to each other, which had to be de­clined.</p>
    <p>He said that some cus­tomers queued to en­ter the restau­rants, but left after be­ing told that Prive would not ad­mit their group of more than five, with some say­ing they would rather go else­where where they could flout the rules.</p>
    <p>Seoul Gar­den Group gen­eral man­ager Garry Lam said that while it was a chal­lenge to manage the ex­pec­ta­tions of cus­tomers who came in groups of more than five, most were re­cep­tive after staff ex­plained the rules.</p>
    <p>One diner, mar­ket­ing in­tern Crys­tal Loh, 23, said she was not sure whether groups larger than five are al­lowed to dine at sep­a­rate ta­bles in a restau­rant if they stay apart.</p>
    <p>Ms Loh: “As long as we do not min­gle across ta­bles, we are not break­ing any rules, I think?</p>
    <p>“But I un­der­stand that go­ing out as a group big­ger than five makes things dif­fi­cult be­cause restau­rants have a hard time en­forc­ing the rules and friends have the ten­dency to come to­gether, even if they keep to sep­a­rate groups of five.”</p>
