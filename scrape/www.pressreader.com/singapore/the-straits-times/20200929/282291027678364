    <p>Lionel Messi was back in scor­ing busi­ness for Barcelona on Sun­day as Ron­ald Koe­man be­gan his ten­ure as coach with a re­sound­ing 4-0 win at home against Vil­lar­real in their La Liga opener.</p>
    <p>While there were no vis­i­ble signs of dis­con­tent from Messi in his first com­pet­i­tive game since try­ing to leave the club in the sum­mer, Barca fans got a glimpse of what life could be like at the Nou Camp once the Ar­gen­tinian fi­nally moves on.</p>
    <p>Teenage for­ward Ansu Fati stole the show, com­bin­ing with Jordi Alba to side-foot home first time into the net in the 15th minute and then strik­ing again four min­utes later with an­other cool fin­ish.</p>
    <p>Messi, in the fi­nal year of his deal, was barely a fig­ure in the open­ing 20 min­utes. He touched the ball six times as Fati ran riot down the left­hand side – his elec­tric pace, quick feet and di­rect­ness caus­ing the vis­it­ing de­fence no end of prob­lems.</p>
    <p>The 17-year-old, in his sec­ond sea­son in Barca’s first team, then won the penalty which cap­tain Messi dis­patched in the 35th minute.</p>
    <p>Vil­lar­real de­fender Pau Tor­res scored an own goal at the end of the first half, with Barca con­tin­u­ing to dom­i­nate in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>For years, Barca man­agers have been try­ing to limit the team’s re­liance on Messi – Mes­side­pen­den­cia as it is known in Spain.</p>
    <p>There had been a lot of talk about the 4-2-3-1 shape Koe­man had been work­ing on in pre-sea­son and the for­ma­tion could hardly have had a bet­ter first out­ing. The Dutch­man de­ployed Messi in the false nine role that he had per­fected a decade ago, with Fati on the left wing and An­toine Griez­mann on the right, with a re­born Philippe Coutinho as an at­tack­ing mid­fielder to knit the of­fence to­gether.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the front four, Ser­gio Bus­quets and Frenkie de Jong pro­vided a solid base that saw Barca swarm all over Vil­lar­real and move the ball with speed and pur­pose, a wel­come con­trast to the pon­der­ous, slow football they had played for much of last sea­son.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways im­por­tant to win games,” said Koe­man, who suc­ceeded Quique Se­tien last month af­ter the crush­ing 8-2 de­feat by Bay­ern Mu­nich in the Cham­pi­ons League quar­ter-fi­nals. “You gain con­fi­dence. This re­sult will help us to im­prove and to be clear about what we want.”</p>
