    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON The Covid-19 pan­demic is set to nearly dou­ble the num­ber of peo­ple fac­ing star­va­tion this year, but pre­par­ing bet­ter would help bat­tle such crises in the fu­ture, said an of­fi­cial at the World Food Pro­gramme (WFP), af­ter it won the No­bel Peace Prize on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>As the United Na­tions food-aid agency was re­warded for its ef­forts to fight hunger and im­prove con­di­tions for peace in con­flict-af­fected ar­eas, Mr Ger­not La­ganda said the coro­n­avirus shock has made clear that aid can­not keep pace with mul­ti­ply­ing threats.</p>
    <p>“You won’t get to zero hunger with hu­man­i­tar­ian aid alone,” Mr La­ganda, head of cli­mate and dis­as­ter-risk re­duc­tion for the WFP, told the Thom­son Reuters Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>“You need two par­al­lel lanes of work: re­spond­ing to ex­treme events and help­ing gov­ern­ments build sys­tems that can man­age risks.”</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 has tested coun­tries’ abil­ity to deal with stresses “like never be­fore”, grow­ing knowl­edge of the gaps “is equally rel­e­vant in manag­ing the cli­mate emer­gency”, he noted.</p>
    <p>To­day, as hunger grows de­spite a global goal to elim­i­nate it by 2030, WFP spends about 80 per cent of its money in re­spond­ing to ur­gent crises in places from Afghanista­n to East Africa, Mr La­ganda said.</p>
    <p>But as wors­en­ing ex­treme weather linked to cli­mate change and threats like the pan­demic and con­flict push more peo­ple into hunger, the gap be­tween what the agency can raise in do­na­tions and what it needs to spend is widen­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>That is a prob­lem likely to worsen as an eco­nomic down­turn pro­voked by the pan­demic tight­ens aid bud­gets around the globe.</p>
    <p>“Even with the prize now, whether we can fill this gap is a ques­tion,” Mr La­ganda said in a tele­phone in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>At the award an­nounce­ment, Ms Berit Reiss-An­der­sen, chair­man of the Nor­we­gian No­bel Com­mit­tee, called on the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity to ad­e­quately fund the foodaid agency.</p>
    <p>“This is an obli­ga­tion, i n our minds, of all states of the world, to en­sure that peo­ple are not starv­ing,” she said.</p>
    <p>PRE­PAR­ING FOR DIS­AS­TER</p>
    <p>To help close the fund­ing gap, re­duce suf­fer­ing and get help to peo­ple more quickly, WFP has in­vested in ef­forts to curb risks, through mea­sures in­clud­ing bet­ter early-warn­ing sys­tems, in­sur­ance poli­cies and so­cial safety nets.</p>
    <p>In Bangladesh, hit this year by floods that cov­ered a quar­ter of the coun­try, early-warn­ing sys­tems pro­vided a four-day no­tice of the com­ing del­uge, Mr La­ganda said.</p>
    <p>That trig­gered “an­tic­i­pa­tory” pay­outs – cash de­liv­ered via mo­bile phones through a so­cial safety net pro­gramme – that gave 20,000 fam­i­lies re­sources to move their valu­ables out of harm’s way.</p>
    <p>WFP, which helped set up the govern­ment sys­tem through which it de­liv­ered the sup­port, said ex­perts had doc­u­mented that each dol­lar of such spend­ing can save US$3 (S$4) in hu­man­i­tar­ian aid, as well as dis­rup­tion and losses for fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, in drought-hit coun­tries such as Zim­babwe and Mau­ri­ta­nia, WFP is sup­port­ing in­sur­ance poli­cies that pro­vide quick pay­outs – four to six months faster than hu­man­i­tar­ian aid usu­ally ar­rives – when rains and crops fail, he added.</p>
    <p>Early as­sis­tance helps cash-short farm­ers avoid sell­ing the oxen they</p>
    <p>need to re­plant fields next year or cut­ting down rain-reg­u­lat­ing trees to sell as fire­wood – mea­sures that can push them into a down­ward spi­ral, Mr La­ganda said.</p>
    <p>Ms Reiss-An­der­sen said tack­ling hunger means “not only pro­vid­ing food – it’s also about cre­at­ing sus­tain­able com­mu­ni­ties where the food pro­duc­tion... can sup­port (their) peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>“If (lack of) food is the rea­son for war and con­flict, cre­at­ing food­se­cure com­mu­ni­ties also cre­ates safer com­mu­ni­ties which are less prone to con­flict,” she added.</p>
    <p>BREAK­ING HUNGER CY­CLE</p>
    <p>Mr La­ganda noted one big prob­lem is that peo­ple who be­come re­liant on hu­man­i­tar­ian aid – of­ten af­ter crops fail, jobs and re­mit­tances dry up and all their as­sets are sold – usu­ally strug­gle to sur­vive with­out it.</p>
    <p>Pro­grammes like those pro­vid­ing food vouch­ers or cash for peo­ple who do work like plant­ing trees, dig­ging ponds or restor­ing de­graded farm­land of­ten last only through the dis­as­ter pe­riod, he noted.</p>
    <p>To help break the cy­cle, hu­man­i­tar­ian spend­ing should be combined with de­vel­op­ment aid to tackle poverty and build re­silience for the longer term, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr La­ganda warned that while wealth­ier coun­tries have so far avoided the worst of the hunger, con­flict and cli­mate crises af­fect­ing the rest of the world, they are not im­mune from shocks, as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has made clear.</p>
    <p>From United States wild­fires and un­prece­dented heat to a string of de­struc­tive hur­ri­canes, cli­mate pres­sures “are knock­ing on ev­ery­one’s door”, he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Sara Pan­tu­liano, head of Lon­don-based Over­seas De­vel­op­ment In­sti­tute, said the No­bel award to WFP should re­in­force “the im­por­tance of look­ing at the longer-term im­pact of a num­ber of crises – the pan­demic be­ing one, but also... cli­mate change and other global pres­sures”.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing the prize to a UN agency could be seen as push­back against na­tion­al­is­tic re­sponses to in­ter­na­tional threats, she noted.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, this is a mo­ment that will fo­cus minds to think how we need to re­shape global co­op­er­a­tion” with an em­pha­sis on broader al­liances with busi­ness and civil so­ci­ety, she added.</p>
    <p>“We can­not ad­dress global crises in iso­la­tion.”</p>
