    <p>The School of Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy, Sin­ga­pore (SST) and Ngee Ann Polytech­nic (NP) will be launch­ing a pi­lot In­te­grated Diploma Pro­gramme (IDP).</p>
    <p>It is for stu­dents who are strong aca­dem­i­cally and dis­play an ap­ti­tude in ap­plied sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing and math­e­mat­ics (Stem). They must also want to pur­sue a polytech­nic ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pro­gramme, stu­dents from SST will progress di­rectly to a Stem course in NP with­out hav­ing to sit the O levels.</p>
    <p>The IDP was an­nounced by Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong yes­ter­day at SST’s 10th an­niver­sary cel­e­bra­tions, held vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>SST is a spe­cialised in­de­pen­dent school that of­fers a four-year Olevel pro­gramme, with a fo­cus on ap­plied learn­ing in the fields of sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy, en­gi­neer­ing, aes­thet­ics and math­e­mat­ics. The ap­plied learn­ing ap­proach is to con­nect the­o­ret­i­cal con­cepts to reallife ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>There are three other spe­cialised in­de­pen­dent schools in Sin­ga­pore – the NUS High School of Math­e­mat­ics and Sci­ence, School of the Arts and Sin­ga­pore Sports School.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, in a speech yes­ter­day, said the IDP would al­low stu­dents to “have more time and space freed up to en­gage in deeper ap­plied learn­ing, across a wider range of Stem fields”.</p>
    <p>He added: “This will in­clude the op­por­tu­nity to em­bark on longert­erm cap­stone projects, where they can draw in­sights from dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines to tackle in­ter­est­ing chal­lenges.”</p>
    <p>De­tails of the pi­lot pro­gramme are be­ing worked out by the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry, SST and NP. For a start, it will in­volve about 50 SST stu­dents in each co­hort and they will be se­lected at the end of Sec­ondary 2.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong praised SST for its role and achieve­ments in ap­plied Stem learn­ing, not­ing that it started out with two goals.</p>
    <p>He said: “The first was to de­velop a strong and early pipe­line of Stem tal­ents who can help Sin­ga­pore ce­ment our po­si­tion as a com­pet­i­tive force in the world econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“The sec­ond was to nur­ture fu­ture-mak­ers who can con­trib­ute to so­ci­ety by turn­ing their pas­sion for ap­plied tech­nolo­gies into re­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>As it marks 10 years, the school is on the cusp of its next phase of growth – and in a post-Covid-19 world, the fu­ture is bound to be more dis­rup­tive, com­plex and un­cer­tain, Mr Wong added.</p>
    <p>“We must do more to help our youth adapt and thrive in this new en­vi­ron­ment. This would re­quire new, in­no­va­tive meth­ods of learn­ing so as to de­velop in­di­vid­u­als with not just deep Stem ex­per­tise, but also other im­por­tant qual­i­ties – adapt­abil­ity and re­silience, the dis­po­si­tion to keep on learn­ing, and the abil­ity to ini­ti­ate pos­i­tive change in so­ci­ety,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Sports School also of­fers a through-train path­way for se­lected stu­dent-ath­letes. They can by­pass the na­tional ex­am­i­na­tions and progress to the In­ter­na­tional Bac­calau­re­ate Diploma Pro­gramme, the cus­tomised Repub­lic Polytech­nic-Sin­ga­pore Sports School Diploma in Busi­ness, or the cus­tomised Ngee Ann Polytech­nic-Sin­ga­pore Sports School Diploma in Busi­ness Stud­ies.</p>
