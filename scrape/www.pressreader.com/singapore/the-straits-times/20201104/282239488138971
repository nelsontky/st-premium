    <p>Pliers were used to twist the vic­tim’s toes and a ham­mer was used to knock out her teeth. A baseball bat was also used to hit her head and she was splashed with boil­ing wa­ter. The re­peated acts of abuse caused the vic­tim to de­velop vis­ual dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral mem­bers of a fam­ily are ac­cused of phys­i­cally abus­ing a fe­male friend of theirs who has mild in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Pliers were used to twist the vic­tim’s toes and a ham­mer was used to knock out her teeth. A baseball bat was also used to hit her head and she was splashed with boil­ing wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The re­peated acts of abuse caused the vic­tim to de­velop vis­ual dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>A district court heard that dur­ing a Hari Raya Haji cel­e­bra­tion in Septem­ber 2017, one of her al­leged tor­men­tors, Haslinda Is­mail, 34, uri­nated into a packet of hor fun and forced her to eat the soiled food. The fam­ished woman com­plied. She was fi­nally sent to hos­pi­tal in a “near death state” in Jan­uary 2018.</p>
    <p>Haslinda’s Egyp­tian hus­band, Hany Aboubakr Ab­delka­rim Ab­delfat­tah, 33, pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to one count of as­sault­ing the vic­tim and was sen­tenced to three weeks’ jail.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing his wife and her fam­ily mem­bers are still pend­ing. They are her sib­lings Muham­mad Iski Is­mail, 29, Muham­mad Iskan­dar Is­mail, 31, and Has­niza Is­mail, 39, and their mother Has­mah Su­long, 69.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Prosecutor­s Ang Feng Qian, Li Yi­hong and Ng Jun Chong stated in court doc­u­ments that the vic­tim, now 30, was a se­condary school friend of Haslinda’s younger brother, Mr Muham­mad Isafi Is­mail.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim got to know the fam­ily through Mr Isafi and his then girl­friend, grew close to the fam­ily and of­ten vis­ited their flat at Block 714 Wood­lands Drive 70.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim, who worked at a fast-food res­tau­rant, ran away from home in early 2016 and moved into the fam­ily’s flat where she stayed rent-free.</p>
    <p>Hany, who was a sales as­sis­tant at a su­per­mar­ket near the res­tau­rant where the vic­tim worked, be­friended her and they be­came close. Some time be­tween May and June 2016, she per­formed sex­ual acts on him.</p>
    <p>Haslinda later found out and con­fronted the vic­tim in the flat. She slapped the woman be­fore ask­ing her hus­band to do like­wise. Haslinda and her fam­ily con­tin­ued abus­ing the vic­tim after this in­ci­dent, said the DPPs.</p>
    <p>Haslinda and Hany later moved to a unit at Block 785A Wood­lands Rise.</p>
    <p>On Aug 31, 2017, Haslinda took the vic­tim to her home to help with the fam­ily’s Hari Raya Haji prepa­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>They reached her home at around 10pm. The court heard Haslinda then made the vic­tim stand in the kitchen. The DPPs</p>
    <p>said she also made sure the vic­tim did not use the toi­let or sleep that night. The vic­tim soiled her­self at around 11am the next day.</p>
    <p>The prosecutor­s said Haslinda flew into a rage and hit the vic­tim with a broom­stick un­til it broke. The vic­tim was then made to stand in the kitchen in her soiled trousers un­til the fam­ily ar­rived for Hari Raya cel­e­bra­tions at around 3pm. They did noth­ing when they saw her.</p>
    <p>Has­mah brought two pack­ets of hor fun for the vic­tim, the court heard. The DPPs said Haslinda then threw one packet away and uri­nated into the other.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Haslinda forced the vic­tim to eat the tainted food. Later, Haslinda told Hany to slap the vic­tim’s face and he com­plied.</p>
    <p>Haslinda, Has­niza, Iskan­dar and Iski are ex­pected to plead guilty on Nov 25. Their mother’s pre­trial con­fer­ence will be held on Nov 30.</p>
