    <p>One of the world’s largest sov­er­eign wealth funds has said “di­vi­sive trends” in ar­eas such as eco­nomics, tech­nol­ogy and geopol­i­tics will re­main for some time, mean­ing in­vestors will have to be more nim­ble to be prof­itable.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Chow Kiat, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Sin­ga­pore’s GIC, iden­ti­fied this “great dis­per­sion” as a force that needs as­sess­ing in or­der to re-imag­ine the future as the world un­der­goes big changes.</p>
    <p>He also warned that large pol­icy in­ter­ven­tions by gov­ern­ments to avert eco­nomic col­lapse due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic are not by them­selves a long-term so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“The re­sult­ing low in­ter­est rates, debt piles and heavy fi­nan­cial mar­ket reliance on pol­icy sup­port could lead to large dis­tor­tions of eco­nomic de­ci­sions, macro in­sta­bil­ity and mar­ket fragility,” Mr Lim said in a GIC In­sights re­port re­leased last Fri­day. “We ex­pect the eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment to be volatile and chal­leng­ing,” he added.</p>
    <p>Most emer­gency spend­ing and lend­ing have gone to­wards re­liev­ing short-term pres­sures and are a liq­uid­ity bridge, he said, adding that sol­vency re­mains an is­sue.</p>
    <p>As to how in­vestors need to adapt and ad­just to the re­sult­ing wide dis­per­sion of out­comes, Mr Lim sug­gested look­ing un­der mar­ket ag­gre­gates and in­dices more thor­oughly, as im­por­tant risks and op­por­tu­ni­ties may be hid­den in them.</p>
    <p>The re­port also said that pan­el­lists at a GIC In­sights event last Fri­day dis­cussed how the Covid-19 pan­demic has ex­posed vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties in the global bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal sup­ply chain, and raised re­newed con­cerns over the off­shoring of fa­cil­i­ties to Asia.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has high­lighted the heavy reliance on large pro­ducer mar­kets – such as China and In­dia – for crit­i­cal med­i­cal sup­plies. As a re­sult, gov­ern­ments will likely seek to in­crease the se­cu­rity of such sup­plies through a cer­tain de­gree of on­shoring and di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>Sup­ply chains have moved off­shore over time, and span mul­ti­ple coun­tries in many cases. For ex­am­ple, In­dia makes and sup­plies 40 per cent of generic drugs to the United States, while China is a ma­jor sup­plier of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal raw ma­te­ri­als to In­dia.</p>
    <p>In the US, a heav­ily dis­cussed area has been the man­u­fac­tur­ing of crit­i­cal ac­tive phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­gre­di­ents, also known as APIs, and med­i­cal sup­plies. These man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties are of­ten con­cen­trated out­side the US, in coun­tries such as In­dia and China.</p>
    <p>How­ever, de­ci­sions to on­shore and diver­sify the bio­pharma sup­ply chain are not straight­for­ward.</p>
    <p>“Low labour costs, state sub­si­dies and eas­ier reg­u­la­tions have helped make mar­kets like China and In­dia at­trac­tive as man­u­fac­tur­ing hubs; re­vers­ing this trend will not be easy,” the re­port stated.</p>
    <p>De­spite US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ex­ec­u­tive or­der to “buy Amer­ica” for es­sen­tial prod­ucts, it may be nei­ther eco­nom­i­cal nor easy to repli­cate in the US on a large scale the in­fra­struc­ture and ca­pac­ity found in China and In­dia.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, the US gov­ern­ment is not the big­gest buyer of generic medicines in the coun­try. Most of the US sup­ply goes to com­mer­cial mega-buy­ers, the re­port stated.</p>
    <p>Whether wide­spread reshoring can be achieved with­out heavy sub­si­dies is also un­clear.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies will learn from the Covid-19 ex­pe­ri­ence, stream­line op­er­a­tions and strengthen end-toend sup­ply chain pro­cesses, to in­crease their re­silience should an­other pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>“But ul­ti­mately, in the cor­po­rate world, changes to sup­ply chain strat­egy will still have to be driven by cost and cap­i­tal ef­fi­cien­cies,” the re­port added.</p>
    <p>The pan­el­lists also noted that strate­gic shifts in the sup­ply chain may ben­e­fit mar­kets with ex­por­to­ri­ented economies and poli­cies, such as Switzer­land and Sin­ga­pore, rather than the US.</p>
    <p>The re­sult­ing low in­ter­est rates, debt piles and heavy fi­nan­cial mar­ket reliance on pol­icy sup­port could lead to large dis­tor­tions of eco­nomic de­ci­sions, macro in­sta­bil­ity and mar­ket fragility... We ex­pect the eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment to be volatile and chal­leng­ing. GIC CHIEF LIM CHOW KIAT</p>
