    <p>LOS ANGELES • Amer­i­can of­fi­cials on Mon­day found the body of Glee ac­tress Naya Rivera in the Cal­i­for­nian lake where she drowned last week dur­ing a boat trip with her four-year-old son.</p>
    <p>Rivera’s body was re­trieved and an ini­tial ex­am­i­na­tion found no ev­i­dence of foul play or sui­cide, Ven­tura County Sher­iff Bill Ayub told a press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“We are con­fi­dent the body we found is that of Naya Rivera,” said Mr Ayub, point­ing to the lo­ca­tion, ap­pear­ance, cloth­ing and con­di­tion of the body.</p>
    <p>Her body was be­ing taken to a med­i­cal ex­am­iner’s of­fice for a full au­topsy and con­fir­ma­tion of her iden­tity from den­tal records, though no other miss­ing per­sons have been re­ported at Lake Piru, he added.</p>
    <p>Rivera, 33, is be­lieved to have ac­ci­den­tally drowned af­ter rent­ing the boat with her young son at the camp­ing and recre­ational hot spot around an hour’s drive north-west of Los Angeles.</p>
    <p>She van­ished last Wed­nes­day af­ter­noon, and a mas­sive search in­volv­ing divers, pa­trol boats and he­li­copters was launched af­ter her sleep­ing son was spot­ted drift­ing alone in a boat on the lake.</p>
    <p>The boy later told in­ves­ti­ga­tors that Rivera had helped him into the boat be­fore “he looked back and saw her dis­ap­pear un­der the sur­face of the wa­ter”, said the sher­iff.</p>
    <p>Mr Ayub pointed to the lake’s strong cur­rents as a pos­si­ble cause of a fa­tal ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“The idea per­haps be­ing that the boat started drift­ing – it was unan­chored – and that she mus­tered enough en­ergy to get her son back onto the boat, but not enough to save her­self,” he said.</p>
    <p>The lake has been closed to the pub­lic since last Wed­nes­day, with around 100 per­son­nel, in­clud­ing the United States Coast Guard and res­cuers from neigh­bour­ing coun­ties, join­ing the search.</p>
    <p>Rivera was best known for her role as high school cheer­leader San­tana Lopez in Glee (2009 to 2015). She starred for six sea­sons in the wildly pop­u­lar mu­si­cal tele­vi­sion se­ries set in a US high school that ended in 2015.</p>
    <p>She mar­ried ac­tor Ryan Dorsey in 2014 and gave birth to their son, Josey Hol­lis, in 2015. The cou­ple split in 2018.</p>
    <p>This is not the first time the Glee cast has been struck by tragedy.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tor Mark Salling took his own life in 2018, weeks be­fore his sched­uled sen­tenc­ing for pos­ses­sion of child pornog­ra­phy. He was 35.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian ac­tor Cory Mon­teith died at age 31 in July 2013 of an over­dose of drugs and al­co­hol. Rivera’s body was found on the same day Mon­teith died seven years ago.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Glee co-stars paid trib­ute to Rivera on so­cial me­dia on Mon­day. Lea Michelle, who starred as Rachel Berry in Glee, posted blackand-white pho­tos of Rivera and Mon­teith on her In­sta­gram Story. Michelle and Mon­teith were dat­ing be­fore his death.</p>
    <p>Michelle also posted a group photo of the Glee cast on In­sta­gram. She had de­ac­ti­vated her Twit­ter ac­count last Satur­day af­ter be­ing bul­lied over Rivera’s dis­ap­pear­ance due to their al­leged feud on the set.</p>
    <p>Jane Lynch, who played the track-suit-wear­ing coach Sue Sylvester, wrote on Twit­ter: “Rest sweet, Naya. What a force you were. Love and peace to your fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Kevin McHale, who played the wheel­chair-bound Ar­tie Abrams, posted a photo of him and Rivera to­gether, as he wrote: “My Naya, my Snixxx, my Bee. I le­git­i­mately can­not imag­ine this world with­out you.”</p>
