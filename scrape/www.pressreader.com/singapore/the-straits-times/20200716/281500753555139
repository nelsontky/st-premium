    <p>NEW YORK • United Na­tions de­mog­ra­phers have an­tic­i­pated since last year that the world’s pop­u­la­tion may stop grow­ing by 2100 as fer­til­ity rates de­cline, pro­ject­ing a peak of 10.9 bil­lion peo­ple by the cen­tury’s end, com­pared with roughly 7.8 bil­lion now.</p>
    <p>But a study pub­lished on Tues­day in med­i­cal jour­nal The Lancet has chal­lenged that fore­cast, with ma­jor eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The study as­serted that the global pop­u­la­tion could peak at 9.7 bil­lion by 2064 – nearly four decades ear­lier – and de­cline to 8.8 bil­lion by 2100.</p>
    <p>More­over, the study con­cluded that the el­derly will make up a big­ger chunk of the to­tal than pro­jected in the UN fore­cast, and the pop­u­la­tions of at least 23 coun­tries, in­clud­ing Ja­pan, Thai­land, Italy and Spain, could shrink by more than 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>The study also pro­jected sig­nif­i­cant de­clines in the work­ing-age pop­u­la­tions of China and In­dia, the two most pop­u­lous coun­tries, por­tend­ing a weak­en­ing in their global eco­nomic power.</p>
    <p>The study’s pro­jec­tions, if borne out, also carry sig­nif­i­cant con­se­quences for the United States, whose econ­omy is ex­pected to trail China’s in size by 2035.</p>
    <p>As China’s work­ing-age pop­u­la­tion de­clines in the sec­ond half of the cen­tury, the study said, the US could re­claim the top spot eco­nom­i­cally by 2098 – if im­mi­gra­tion con­tin­ues to re­plen­ish the US work­force.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct will rise to take the No. 3 spot, while Ja­pan, Ger­many, France and Bri­tain will stay among the world’s 10 largest economies.</p>
    <p>Brazil is pro­jected to fall in the rank­ings from the eighth largest econ­omy to­day to 13th place, and Rus­sia from the 10th spot to 14th.</p>
    <p>His­tor­i­cal pow­ers Italy and Spain, mean­while, will de­cline from the top 15 to 25th and 28th, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia could be­come the 12th largest econ­omy glob­ally, while Nige­ria – cur­rently 28th – is pro­jected to crack the top 10.</p>
    <p>“By the end of the cen­tury, the world will be mul­ti­po­lar, with In­dia, Nige­ria, China and the United States the dom­i­nant pow­ers,” said Dr Richard Hor­ton, ed­i­tor-in-chief of The Lancet, de­scrib­ing the study as out­lin­ing “rad­i­cal shifts in geopo­lit­i­cal power”.</p>
    <p>Dr Christo­pher Mur­ray, di­rec­tor of the In­sti­tute for Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion (IHME) at the Univer­sity of Wash­ing­ton’s School of Medicine and who led the study, said: “Con­tin­ued global pop­u­la­tion growth through the cen­tury is no longer the most likely tra­jec­tory for the world’s pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>Founded in 2007 and sup­ported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foun­da­tion, the IHME has be­come a global ref­er­ence for health sta­tis­tics, es­pe­cially its an­nual Global Bur­den of Dis­ease re­ports.</p>
    <p>Dr Mur­ray said the pop­u­la­tion study “pro­vides gov­ern­ments of all coun­tries an op­por­tu­nity to start re­think­ing their poli­cies on mi­gra­tion, work­forces and eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment to ad­dress the chal­lenges pre­sented by de­mo­graphic change”.</p>
    <p>An im­por­tant un­der­ly­ing rea­son be­hind the con­clu­sions is the im­prove­ment in ac­cess to mod­ern con­tra­cep­tion and the ed­u­ca­tion of girls and women, which the study said would “has­ten de­clines in fer­til­ity and slow pop­u­la­tion growth”.</p>
    <p>While the most re­cent UN pop­u­la­tion fore­cast, made in June last year, also noted de­clin­ing fer­til­ity, the new study said the con­se­quences would be felt much sooner and with greater im­pact.</p>
    <p>Mr John Wil­moth, di­rec­tor of the pop­u­la­tion divi­sion in the UN Depart­ment of Eco­nomic and So­cial</p>
    <p>Af­fairs, which pro­duces the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s pro­jec­tions every two years, said on Tues­day that he had not yet fully read the study.</p>
    <p>But he said that it had made some as­sump­tions about fer­til­ity, mor­tal­ity and mi­gra­tion that helped shape the con­clu­sions.</p>
    <p>One of the big­gest as­sump­tions, he said in a phone in­ter­view, was that coun­tries with low fer­til­ity rates would do noth­ing to raise them be­tween now and 2100.</p>
    <p>“It’s kind of an ex­treme as­sump­tion to think that coun­tries aren’t go­ing to think their way out of the prob­lem for the next 80 years,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­moth also said the UN had been track­ing pop­u­la­tion trends for 70 years and that its pro­jec­tions “rep­re­sent a con­sen­sus view” among de­mog­ra­phers.</p>
    <p>Still, he said: “I wel­come this sort of cre­ative in­quiry about other ways of see­ing these things.”</p>
    <p>The fore­cast­ing method­ol­ogy used in the study found that by 2100, 183 of 195 coun­tries would have to­tal fer­til­ity rates – the av­er­age num­ber of chil­dren a woman has over her life­time – be­low the re­place­ment level of 2.1 births. That is the level needed to pre­vent pop­u­la­tion de­cline.</p>
    <p>The study also sug­gested that the de­cline could be off­set by im­mi­gra­tion, with coun­tries that pro­mote lib­eral im­mi­gra­tion poli­cies bet­ter able to main­tain their pop­u­la­tion and sup­port eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries with fer­til­ity rates lower than re­place­ment level, such as the US, Aus­tralia and Canada, would prob­a­bly re­plen­ish their work­ing-age pop­u­la­tions through net im­mi­gra­tion, the study said, al­though it noted un­cer­tainty about such a fore­cast.</p>
    <p>The back­lash in the US against im­mi­gra­tion, the study said, could threaten “the coun­try’s po­ten­tial to sus­tain pop­u­la­tion and eco­nomic growth”.</p>
    <p>Sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa may be­come more pow­er­ful as its pop­u­la­tion rises, ac­cord­ing to the anal­y­sis.</p>
