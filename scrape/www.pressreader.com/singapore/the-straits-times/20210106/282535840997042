    <p>“Doc, must I re­ally take an­other pill?” Mr Tan (not his real name) asked. He was al­ready on seven dif­fer­ent med­i­ca­tions – four for his heart con­di­tion, one for high blood pres­sure, one for choles­terol and an­other for di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>Now I had to con­vince him to take his eighth pill – ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan is 67 and has been liv­ing with high blood pres­sure, high choles­terol and di­a­betes for the last 10 years.</p>
    <p>Three years ago, he sur­vived a heart at­tack af­ter un­der­go­ing emer­gency stent­ing to one of his heart ar­ter­ies. How­ever, that episode left him with weak­ened heart func­tion and heart fail­ure.</p>
    <p>He has been pre­scribed with med­i­ca­tion for each of these con­di­tions, but he has found it hard to reg­u­larly take them.</p>
    <p>Some­times, he missed his med­i­ca­tion be­cause he for­got or was in a rush. At other times, he felt well and thought he did not need the pills. Or he just felt tired of tak­ing so many pills.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan is not alone in his strug­gles to keep up with the long list of med­i­ca­tions he is sup­posed to take daily.</p>
    <p>Heart fail­ure is a com­mon disease which re­quires treat­ment with mul­ti­ple drugs rec­om­mended by in­ter­na­tional guide­lines.</p>
    <p>These drugs have been proven to pro­long life, re­duce hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion rates and im­prove symp­toms in ro­bust sci­en­tific tri­als.</p>
    <p>The ben­e­fits of these drugs are ad­di­tive, which means they work dif­fer­ently and in com­bi­na­tion to give pa­tients the best chance of main­tain­ing their health.</p>
    <p>Even when pa­tients feel well, it is crit­i­cal that they con­tinue tak­ing the med­i­ca­tion to keep their con­di­tions sta­ble.</p>
    <p>Most pa­tients with heart fail­ure will need to take an av­er­age of five to six dif­fer­ent med­i­ca­tions for their heart con­di­tion alone.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients with heart fail­ure of­ten have co­mor­bidi­ties that re­quire ad­di­tional spe­cific treat­ment for each con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Thus, polyphar­macy – the con­cur­rent use of mul­ti­ple med­i­ca­tions – is im­por­tant in the treat­ment of heart fail­ure pa­tients. Un­for­tu­nately, polyphar­macy has been as­so­ci­ated with ad­verse drug in­ter­ac­tions and poor ad­her­ence, among other neg­a­tive ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Ways to re­duce pill bur­den in­clude com­bi­na­tion pills (that com­prise two or more drugs in one pill), longer-act­ing drugs (to re­duce the fre­quency of hav­ing to take them) and drugs that can be used to treat mul­ti­ple con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>About a third of pa­tients with heart fail­ure have di­a­betes. Pa­tients with both heart fail­ure and di­a­betes have a poorer sur­vival rate and a higher hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion rate than pa­tients with­out di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>Di­a­betes can lead to block­ages in the heart ar­ter­ies or heart at­tacks, re­sult­ing in weak­en­ing of the heart func­tion and thus heart fail­ure.</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dently, pro­longed pe­ri­ods of high blood su­gar lev­els can have di­rect and in­di­rect toxic ef­fects on the heart mus­cles at the molec­u­lar level.</p>
    <p>How­ever, for many years, treat­ment and con­trol of di­a­betes with pre-ex­ist­ing di­a­betes med­i­ca­tion have been shown to mainly re­duce end or­gan dam­age, but have lit­tle sig­nif­i­cant im­pact in re­duc­ing heart at­tacks, heart fail­ure and long-term mor­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, a new class of blood su­gar-low­er­ing med­i­ca­tion called the Sodium-Glu­cose Co­trans­porter-2 In­hibitors has been found in sev­eral tri­als to re­duce death due to heart disease and heart fail­ure hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions in pa­tients with di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>They work by in­creas­ing the body’s ex­cre­tion of glu­cose through the urine. This group of drugs has also been shown to slow down the de­te­ri­o­ra­tion of kid­ney func­tion in pa­tients with di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>With the re­sults from these stud­ies, the Sodium-Glu­cose Co­trans­porter-2 In­hibitors have now be­come one of the first-line med­i­ca­tions used in di­a­betes treat­ment, es­pe­cially in pa­tients with pre-ex­ist­ing heart or kid­ney disease.</p>
    <p>In the first in­ter­na­tion­ally con­ducted study of these med­i­ca­tions in heart fail­ure pa­tients just pub­lished in late 2019, Da­pagliflozi­n was found to im­prove sur­vival rate and re­duce wors­en­ing of heart fail­ure in pa­tients with and with­out di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>Other Sodium-Glu­cose Co­trans­porter-2 In­hibitors have also shown sim­i­lar promis­ing ben­e­fits in sub­se­quent heart fail­ure tri­als. This meant that such med­i­ca­tions were no longer just used to treat di­a­betes, but have also be­come treat­ment for heart fail­ure.</p>
    <p>In July last year, Da­pagliflozi­n be­came the first such in­hibitor ap­proved by the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity for the treat­ment of heart fail­ure in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As our pop­u­la­tion ages, the in­ci­dence of heart disease and di­a­betes is set to rise.</p>
    <p>For Mr Tan and many other pa­tients with both di­a­betes and heart fail­ure, med­i­ca­tions such as the Sodium-Glu­cose Co­trans­porter-2 In­hibitors can help re­duce long-term costs and re­duce the num­ber of pills that pa­tients have to take each day.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, these med­i­ca­tions pro­long sur­vival and re­duce time spent in hos­pi­tals, and hence in­crease qual­ity time spent out­side of hos­pi­tals with loved ones.</p>
