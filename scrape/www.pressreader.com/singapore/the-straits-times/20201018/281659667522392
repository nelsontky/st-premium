    <p>The Na­tional Wages Coun­cil has is­sued guide­lines on how tem­po­rary pay cuts could be im­ple­mented, once govern­ment sup­port and other cost-sav­ing mea­sures have been ex­hausted. This is how the wage cuts might im­pact two hy­po­thet­i­cal work­ers be­fore, dur­ing and af­ter the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jah gets a 20% pay cut, amount­ing to $400. He also has no bonus this year. His em­ployer recog­nises $200, or 10% of his orig­i­nal pay as MVC. The other $200 is seen as part of his ba­sic pay. His em­ployer also recog­nises his an­nual bonus – which amounts to about 14% of his an­nual wage – as the an­nual vari­able com­po­nent (AVC).</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jah's em­ployer re­stores his ba­sic pay so that he is earn­ing $1,800, fol­lowed by the ad­di­tional $200 which makes up the MVC. He also gets back his an­nual bonus, or AVC, which his em­ployer should build up un­til it reaches 20% of his an­nual pay pack­age.</p>
