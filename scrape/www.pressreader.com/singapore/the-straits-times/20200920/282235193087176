    <p>Healthy in­stant noo­dles may sound like an oxy­moron, but not to Chris Lang­wall­ner.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, the co-founder of food science start-up NamZ in­tro­duced WhatIf, a range of nutritious and sustainabl­e foods.</p>
    <p>Be­sides shakes and soups, it also in­cluded that old sta­ple in­stant noo­dles, but rein­ter­preted to be good not just for health, but also for the planet.</p>
    <p>His NoodleZ are made from moringa and Bam­bara ground­nut, va­ri­eties of what Mr Lang­wall­ner calls fu­ture-fit crops: nu­tri­ent-rich crops that can with­stand pre­dicted cli­mates and be cul­ti­vated on de­graded land, re­quire less wa­ter, but pro­duce good yields.</p>
    <p>Un­like stan­dard in­stant noo­dles, which are de­hy­drated through deep-fry­ing and the use of palm oil, NoodleZ are pro­duced us­ing a pro­pri­etary tech­nol­ogy – in­spired by the one used to de­hy­drate toi­let pa­per – in­volv­ing steaming and high-ve­loc­ity air.</p>
    <p>The re­sult? A 70 per cent de­crease in fat con­tent.</p>
    <p>If 10 per cent of in­stant noo­dles sold were made with the tech­nol­ogy, US$95 mil­lion (S$129.1 mil­lion) worth of palm oil prod­ucts will be saved, Mr Lang­wall­ner says.</p>
    <p>Launched in June, NoodleZ have been sell­ing like hot­cakes. The noo­dles are avail­able on­line from www.whatif-foods.com. Even be­fore the WhatIf brand was launched, the noo­dles – pro­duced in a fac­tory in Malaysia – were al­ready be­ing sold to restau­rants.</p>
    <p>The fact that it had a clear so­cial im­pact also helped NamZ clinch a grant from the DBS Foun­da­tion So­cial En­ter­prise Grant Pro­gramme last year.</p>
    <p>Born into a farm­ing fam­ily in a vil­lage out­side Vi­enna, Aus­tria, Mr Lang­wall­ner – who has worked in coun­tries in­clud­ing Eng­land, Rus­sia, In­dia and China – was not al­ways so big on health and sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>In fact, the en­tre­pre­neur, who stud­ied agron­omy and food science, once tipped the scales at 130kg – thanks in big part to a job spent mak­ing un­healthy snacks tasty and ad­dic­tive through flavour­ing.</p>
    <p>But over time, his con­science gnawed at him.</p>
    <p>“The way I saw agri­cul­ture be­ing de­vel­oped, food be­ing made and mar­ket­ing gim­micks be­ing used to at­tract peo­ple into un­healthy eat­ing... At some stage, it didn’t feel right for me any­more, it felt aw­ful,” says the 48-year-old, who is mar­ried to a food sci­en­tist.</p>
    <p>They have two chil­dren aged 18 and 21.</p>
    <p>The un­savoury things he learnt about the agri­cul­ture in­dus­try and the havoc it wreaks on the earth’s nat­u­ral re­sources added to his mis­ery.</p>
    <p>“Since start­ing the in­ter­view, we’ve prob­a­bly lost hun­dreds of foot­ball fields of arable land,” he says with a sigh.</p>
    <p>So, he set up NamZ in 2014 with food in­no­va­tor Peter Cheetham to cre­ate a “food science com­pany that ded­i­cates all our work to­wards cre­at­ing a health­ier planet and health­ier peo­ple, one meal at a time”.</p>
    <p>You spent the first half of your work­ing ca­reer in the food in­dus­try mak­ing “rub­bish food taste good”. What was the break­ing point?</p>
    <p>Be­com­ing a fa­ther was one of the defin­ing mo­ments. It led me to be more sen­si­tive to what we put into our bod­ies.</p>
    <p>In my daily job, I needed to make snacks that were more de­li­cious than the last. That meant a lot of fat and salt and adding flavours that have lit­tle to no nu­tri­tional value. I’d go home and dis­cour­age my kids from eat­ing the food I made.</p>
    <p>When you’re build­ing a ca­reer, it can be hard to stop and re­flect. But this ca­reer has also al­lowed me to learn, un­der­stand, ac­cu­mu­late knowl­edge, know-how and experience­s, to form a well­grounded opin­ion on where we are head­ing in the in­dus­try, on what is wrong and what is right.</p>
    <p>In this day and age, you need to dis­rupt an in­dus­try from the out­side rather than from the inside. In­spir­ing change from within can be an im­pos­si­ble un­der­tak­ing as the sta­tus quo is com­fort­able. So, I de­cided to do it with a start-up.</p>
    <p>In a start-up, you start afresh. You make new rules, re­de­fine what is normal, em­brace what you learn to be right and wrong and chal­lenge the sta­tus quo.</p>
    <p>You are try­ing to start a food revo­lu­tion and you are start­ing with noo­dles? Why?</p>
    <p>In­stant noo­dles are a para­dox­i­cal food. They were meant to fill stom­achs af­ter World War II, yet they con­trib­ute very lit­tle nu­tri­tional value. Today, more than 100 bil­lion por­tions are eaten ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>Our chal­lenge was to make the un­healthy food we know and love so much nour­ish­ing. And con­ve­nient.</p>
    <p>Why the name WhatIf?</p>
    <p>Our story started with ask­ing our­selves “what if”. First, it was: “What if we could find a way to make in­stant noo­dles healthy?” Then the ques­tion be­came: “What if eat­ing noo­dles were healthy and good for the planet?” That is still not good enough. “What if noo­dles could do all of t hese t hings and up­lift farm­ing com­mu­ni­ties?</p>
    <p>At ev­ery step of our j our­ney, ask­ing our­selves “what if” has led us to a bet­ter vi­sion of what the fu­ture of food could be. By ask­ing “what if” at ev­ery cor­ner, not only are our in­stant noo­dles today health­ier, but they are also good for the planet and em­power small­holder farm­ing com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>And it wouldn’t be the last time we ask our­selves this ques­tion.</p>
    <p>At the heart of what you do is this con­cept called the “nu­tri­tional para­dox”. How would you ex­plain that to a seven-year-old?</p>
    <p>This is what I would prob­a­bly say: “Lis­ten, you know that eat­ing in fast food restau­rants and munch­ing snacks is not healthy for your body. The best thing you can do for your body and mind is to eat as many types of plants as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“And be­cause so many peo­ple are eat­ing the same thing, what we eat is hurt­ing the peo­ple who grow our food and hurt­ing the planet.</p>
    <p>“Let’s go to the kitchen and play with colours, tex­tures and flavours. Let’s put to­gether 25 plants such as peas, fruit, beans, lentils and vegeta­bles, or take them apart. Ex­per­i­ment. Have fun.</p>
    <p>“You will see that we can eat so many tasty things, with colours like the rain­bow, other than the food we have grown up to eat.</p>
    <p>“And this is how you will help farm­ers as well as your planet.”</p>
    <p>Give some scar­ily com­pelling rea­sons why peo­ple should think about the way food is grown and con­sumed now.</p>
    <p>There are many, but here are a few.</p>
    <p>How and what we eat are hurt­ing us: About 2.3 bil­lion peo­ple on our planet are obese or over­weight, an­other two bil­lion are nu­tri­tion­ally chal­lenged, 800 mil­lion go hun­gry ev­ery night, while the rest of us – about 2.5 bil­lion peo­ple – have some­what achieved an ac­cept­able “well-be­ing”. This means seven out of 10 peo­ple suf­fer from what they eat.</p>
    <p>As for how the way we grow our food is hurt­ing our planet? Just 12 crops and five an­i­mals make up 75 per cent of all food that we con­sume, while only three plants make up 60 per cent of our calo­ries.</p>
    <p>In most re­gions of the world, more than 70 per cent of fresh­wa­ter is used for agri­cul­ture, which con­trib­utes a third of all global hu­man-in­duced green­house gas emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, 77 per cent of arable land is used to pro­duce feed for live­stock, which makes up only 17 per cent of all calo­ries we con­sume.</p>
    <p>The way we grow our food is also dis­em­pow­er­ing farm­ing com­mu­ni­ties – 2.6 bil­lion lives are di­rectly linked to agri­cul­ture, 74 per cent of which are the poor­est of the poor.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery minute, we have 23 foot­ball fields of de­grad­ing lands, yet ev­ery minute, 30 foot­ball fields of ar­eas of bi­o­log­i­cal sig­nif­i­cance are de­for­ested.</p>
    <p>In­ten­sive agri­cul­ture has left be­hind de­graded lands while en­croach­ing into the re­main­ing and re­tract­ing forests of our planet.</p>
    <p>As a con­se­quence, we see more mass cli­mate refugees ev­ery­where in the world.</p>
