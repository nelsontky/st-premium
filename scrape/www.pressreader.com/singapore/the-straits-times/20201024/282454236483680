    <p>LON­DON • Hav­ing thrashed Le­ices­ter and Wolves and snatched a last­gasp draw at Tot­ten­ham in the Pre­mier League, West Ham are go­ing through a pur­ple patch.</p>
    <p>So it is dou­bly frus­trat­ing for man­ager David Moyes that Ham­mers fans con­tinue to be barred from at­tend­ing games, yet are al­lowed to catch a live screen­ing at cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>English top-flight matches have been staged be­hind closed doors since June due to the Covid-19 pan­demic. But West Ham’s home game against Manch­ester City will be aired at se­lected movie the­atres, in­clud­ing one near the Lon­don Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>Ques­tion­ing the logic, Moyes said at his pre-match vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day: “Peo­ple (are) go­ing to watch a game in a cin­ema, close to here, why can we not be sit­ting out­side in the open air do­ing it?</p>
    <p>“Maybe there are other rea­sons – maybe it’s the trav­el­ling on the Tube, the bus; maybe it’s the pubs. But, if that is the case, please come out and give us an ex­pla­na­tion as to why we can’t do it.</p>
    <p>“I’m cer­tainly not an ex­pert on a pan­demic. But I watched the Euro­pean games this week and have seen crowds back in dif­fer­ent coun­tries. It’s hard to be­lieve we can’t do that... Why can those coun­tries be do­ing it and not us?”</p>
    <p>West Ham, who some crit­ics had tipped to go down in pre-sea­son pre­dic­tions, are ninth in the stand­ings with seven points, the same as 11th-placed City who have a game in hand.</p>
    <p>On City’s visit, Moyes said Pep Guardi­ola’s men have strug­gled to hit their stride as they are in a “tran­si­tional pe­riod”, with ex­pe­ri­enced play­ers hav­ing left in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Scot has no il­lu­sions about the task at hand de­spite their good form – they have lost their last eight Pre­mier League matches against City.</p>
    <p>He said: “They lost Vin­cent Kom­pany a year or two ago and they lost David Silva (last sea­son).</p>
    <p>“So they’re try­ing to add to and get the level of those play­ers that they’ve had over the years. They’re look­ing for that, (but) I think Manch­ester City are still one of the best teams in the world.”</p>
    <p>His cau­tious stance was jus­ti­fied af­ter Guardi­ola re­vealed at his pre­match press con­fer­ence that some of his in­jured play­ers would re­turn for the visit to West Ham.</p>
    <p>While the Cata­lan con­firmed Ben­jamin Mendy, Gabriel Je­sus and Fer­nand­inho were out, oth­ers like Kevin de Bruyne and Aymeric La­porte – both were seen in train­ing ear­lier this week – and Nathan Ake look set to be in­cluded.</p>
    <p>Play­ing it coy, Guardi­ola said: “Some of them will be in­volved, some of them not. You will know it to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“The past is the past, we have good re­sults. What we saw against Tot­ten­ham, al­ways West Ham have qual­ity play­ers.</p>
    <p>“They play re­ally well against Tot­ten­ham, not just the last min­utes, even at 3-0 down, they play with a lot of per­son­al­ity. They are in good form. Def­i­nitely, they are in a good mo­ment.</p>
    <p>“This league is so dif­fi­cult. The guys who have seven, eight days be­tween games have more time to pre­pare. On the other side, we are com­pet­ing for ti­tles and this is how we have to live.”</p>
