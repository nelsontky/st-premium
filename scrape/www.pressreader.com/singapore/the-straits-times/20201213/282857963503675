    <p>ABU DHABI • Ear­lier on Fri­day, Max Ver­stap­pen joked that he was ready to claim his P3 seat be­hind the Mercedes duo af­ter free prac­tice at the sea­son-end­ing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>But the Red Bull driver was thrilled af­ter claim­ing his maiden pole po­si­tion of the cam­paign yes­ter­day at the Yas Ma­rina cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>The Dutch­man edged out Valt­teri Bot­tas into sec­ond spot, with the Finn’s Mercedes world cham­pion team­mate Lewis Hamil­ton qual­i­fy­ing third on his re­turn from a on­er­ace ab­sence due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Very happy with that. It was quite a tricky qual­i­fy­ing, there are so many cor­ners where you can make mis­takes but luck­ily ev­ery­thing came to­gether on that fi­nal lap,” said Ver­stap­pen, who had a fastest lap of 1min 35.246sec.</p>
    <p>“It’s a long sea­son for ev­ery­one, with a lot of races in a row. I think this was a good fi­nal qual­i­fy­ing for ev­ery­one in the team and for sure we are very happy with that.</p>
    <p>“It’s great to fi­nally get there af­ter be­ing close many times in 2020. Very, very pleased with to­day. It seems like we have a de­cent top speed this week­end. Hope­fully this will work out for to­mor­row.”</p>
    <p>His time was 0.025sec quicker than Bot­tas, while Hamil­ton was 0.086sec off the pace. Ver­stap­pen’s dis­play around the 5.5km lap earned him only the third pole of his ca­reer and his first since last year’s Brazil­ian Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>It was only the sec­ond time Mercedes were de­nied pole this sea­son and the first time all year that a non-Mercedes pow­ered car will start from the front, with Lance Stroll hav­ing started on pole for Mercedes-en­gined Rac­ing Point in Tur­key.</p>
    <p>“We saw in P3 that Red Bull and es­pe­cially Max were pretty quick. The main is­sue is we couldn’t get the soft tyres to work prop­erly,” said Bot­tas. “I wasn’t fully happy with how ev­ery­thing went. The bal­ance wasn’t per­fect. Small mar­gins and to­mor­row is a new day.”</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton, mean­while, ad­mit­ted that it had been a dif­fi­cult week­end “get­ting back into a rhythm”.</p>
    <p>“Even though it’s only a cou­ple of weeks off it just felt like you’d lost that mo­men­tum and I’ve re­ally strug­gled with the bal­ance,” he added. “But still I gave it my all and con­grat­u­la­tions to Max... I’m ex­cited to see how I can turn it around.”</p>
    <p>Be­hind the top three, Lando Nor­ris was fourth for McLaren ahead of Red Bull’s Alex Al­bon and team­mate Car­los Sainz, who was sixth in his fi­nal qual­i­fy­ing for the team be­fore his move to Fer­rari.</p>
    <p>Se­bas­tian Vet­tel was knocked out in the sec­ond phase of his fi­nal qual­i­fy­ing ses­sion for Fer­rari. The Ger­man, mov­ing to Rac­ing Point which is re­brand­ing to As­ton Martin next year, was 13th.</p>
