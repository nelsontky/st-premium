Eight male and two fe­male sus­pects were ar­rested, the po­lice said in a state­ment on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Ten peo­ple, aged be­tween 16 and 25, have been ar­rested by the po­lice for al­legedly rid­ing dan­ger­ously, af­ter a video of them rid­ing on per­sonal mo­bil­ity de­vices (PMDs) and power-as­sisted bi­cy­cles on the road sur­faced on­line.</p>
    <p>Eight male and two fe­male sus­pects were ar­rested, the po­lice said in a state­ment on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The po­lice were alerted to the video on July 13, show­ing a group of rid­ers trav­el­ling to­gether on PMDs and power-as­sisted bi­cy­cles, also called e-bikes, along Sheares Av­enue.</p>
    <p>In the video, which was posted on the SG Road Vig­i­lante Face­book page, the rid­ers can be seen cruis­ing down mostly empty roads at night, of­ten oc­cu­py­ing the mid­dle lanes.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions, traf­fic po­lice of­fi­cers es­tab­lished the iden­ti­ties of these peo­ple and ar­rested them be­tween July 17 and 20.</p>
    <p>Two PMDs, de­vice parts of an ebike, as well as mo­bile phones were seized.</p>
    <p>The po­lice and the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the group for dan­ger­ous rid­ing and rid­ing a PMD on a road, among other of­fences.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of dan­ger­ous rid­ing, an of­fender can be jailed for up to 12 months, fined up to $5,000, or both. In the case of a sec­ond or sub­se­quent con­vic­tion, the of­fender can be jailed for up to two years, fined up to $10,000, or both.</p>
    <p>Those con­victed of rid­ing a PMD on a road can be jailed for up to three months, fined up to $2,000, or both. In the case of a sec­ond or sub­se­quent con­vic­tion, an of­fender can be jailed for up to six months, fined up to $5,000, or both.</p>
    <p>The po­lice also ad­vised all road users to abide strictly by traf­fic rules and reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“The traf­fic po­lice and LTA will not hes­i­tate to take tough en­force­ment ac­tion against road users and ac­tive mo­bil­ity de­vice users who choose to flout traf­fic rules and en­dan­ger the safety of oth­ers,” the po­lice added.</p>
