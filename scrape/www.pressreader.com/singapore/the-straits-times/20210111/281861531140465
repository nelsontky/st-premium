    <p>WASHINGTON • The White House pres­sured the United States At­tor­ney in Atlanta to quit be­cause Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump was un­happy with a lack of co­op­er­a­tion from of­fi­cials there on his un­proven al­le­ga­tions of elec­tion fraud, the Wall Street Jour­nal re­ported.</p>
    <p>US At­tor­ney Byung J. Pak, a Trump ap­pointee, was told to step down a day be­fore last Tues­day’s Ge­or­gia Se­nate run-off elec­tions, the news­pa­per re­ported, cit­ing sources it did not iden­tify.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can in­cum­bents lost both con­tests.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, The Washington Post re­ported that Mr Trump pres­sured Ge­or­gia’s lead elec­tions in­ves­ti­ga­tor to “find the fraud” in the state and be­come “a na­tional hero” in a call made on Dec 23.</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gia Sec­re­tary of State Brad Raf­fensperger con­firmed to the Post that Mr Trump placed the call, adding that he was not fa­mil­iar with what the Pres­i­dent specif­i­cally said.</p>
    <p>The Post with­held the name of the in­ves­ti­ga­tor, who did not re­spond to its re­quests for com­ment, be­cause of the risk of threats and ha­rass­ment di­rected at elec­tion of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>In the case of Mr Pak, the fed­eral pros­e­cu­tor re­signed abruptly in an e-mail to col­leagues that cited “un­fore­seen cir­cum­stances”.</p>
    <p>The re­ports fol­low a week after it was re­vealed that Mr Trump urged Ge­or­gia elec­tion of­fi­cials in an hour-long call to “find” thou­sands of votes and re­cal­cu­late the state’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ge­or­gia was one of five states won by Demo­crat Joe Bi­den in Novem­ber that Mr Trump had won in 2016. The state had two re­counts of the pres­i­den­tial vote, with each show­ing the same out­come: that Mr Bi­den had a nar­row vic­tory in the state last car­ried by a Demo­crat in 1992.</p>
    <p>Dozens of re­jected claims by Mr Trump and his as­so­ciates that there had been wide­spread elec­tion fraud in the US, rang­ing from dead peo­ple vot­ing to vot­ing ma­chines that changed Trump votes to votes for Mr Bi­den, have been thrown out of court.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­liam Barr, the US At­tor­ney-Gen­eral who de­parted last month, also said that the Jus­tice Depart­ment had not found such ev­i­dence.</p>
