    <p>Three food and bev­er­age out­lets have been or­dered to close for 10 days for flout­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>An­other 15 have been fined, the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The breaches were found dur­ing stepped-up en­force­ment checks by gov­ern­ment agen­cies dur­ing the past week­end.</p>
    <p>Jiang Hu Xia Ke in Or­chard Plaza is one of the three out­lets or­dered to close. Of­fi­cers ar­rived at 11pm last Satur­day and saw 13 cus­tomers pour­ing drinks from metal teapots.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions showed that the teapots con­tained beer, and the restau­rant su­per­vi­sor ad­mit­ted to con­ceal­ing al­co­hol con­sump­tion us­ing the teapots.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act 2020, sell­ing and con­sum­ing al­co­holic bev­er­ages is pro­hib­ited af­ter 10.30pm.</p>
    <p>The out­let was or­dered to close for 10 days from Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cers who ar­rived at 96 Food Fu­sion & Bar in Jurong East last Satur­day at 9pm saw eight pa­trons seated to­gether and in­ter­min­gling at a long ta­ble. The out­let was or­dered to close for 10 days from yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The third out­let or­dered to close is Frog Meat Fish Head at 5 Mosque Street in Chi­na­town.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, the restau­rant ac­cepted a book­ing for 10 cus­tomers and seated the group at two ta­bles in a pri­vate din­ing room. When asked, a staff mem­ber claimed the din­ers at the two ta­bles did not know one an­other.</p>
    <p>How­ever, af­ter fur­ther ques­tion­ing, the cus­tomers ad­mit­ted they were col­leagues, said MSE.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant was or­dered to close from yes­ter­day for 10 days.</p>
    <p>Of the 15 other out­lets pe­nalised, 10 were fined $1,000 for breaches. The other five were fined $2,000 for re­peat of­fences.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, gov­ern­ment agen­cies con­ducted ad­di­tional in­spec­tions at 57 F&B out­lets in known hot spots, said MSE.</p>
    <p>Seven were found to have breached safe man­age­ment mea­sures. The agen­cies are re­view­ing the breaches and con­sid­er­ing the ap­pro­pri­ate en­force­ment ac­tions, said the min­istry.</p>
