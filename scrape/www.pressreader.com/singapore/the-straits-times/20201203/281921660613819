    <p>Af­ter more than two weeks of be­ing clear of Covid-19 cases in the com­mu­nity, Sin­ga­pore has seen a resur­fac­ing of such cases – a sign that the virus has yet to be erad­i­cated. It un­der­scores the need for vig­i­lance and to stick to safe dis­tanc­ing and other mea­sures. Ex­perts note there could be undis­cov­ered asymp­to­matic cases in the com­mu­nity. And while most in­fected trav­ellers will be de­tected, a small num­ber – al­though they un­dergo quar­an­tine and are tested – may not be picked up be­cause of a long in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod. The new com­mu­nity cases show how vir­u­lent the dis­ease is and how eas­ily cases can flare up. So as the econ­omy and bor­ders grad­u­ally open up, more com­mu­nity cases can be ex­pected.</p>
    <p>The way to pre­vent sig­nif­i­cant com­mu­nity spread is for in­di­vid­u­als to ex­er­cise cau­tion when go­ing out, par­tic­u­larly in crowded places, tak­ing nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions such as mask-wearing, keep­ing a safe dis­tance from oth­ers and en­sur­ing proper hy­giene. Im­por­tantly, they should also ad­here to mea­sures such as keep­ing gath­er­ings small – by ob­serv­ing the cur­rent limit of five per­sons to a group – and be­ing part of the track and trace scheme through the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken. Tak­ing these and other sen­si­ble steps will en­sure that smaller num­bers are af­fected should any­one be found to be in­fected, as well as faster trac­ing of close con­tacts. The need to min­imise spread can­not be overem­pha­sised.</p>
    <p>Each com­mu­nity case that oc­curs comes with so­cial and eco­nomic costs. Take the first case to arise af­ter 16 days free of lo­cal trans­mis­sions. The pa­tient’s close con­tacts had to go into quar­an­tine, in­clud­ing 12 rel­a­tives with whom he had din­ner at a restau­rant days be­fore be­ing di­ag­nosed. The af­fected restau­rant had to close for a day to be dis­in­fected and in­curred a loss of busi­ness that day. The most re­cent in­ci­dent, in which in­di­vid­u­als went to three mosques, led to the clo­sure of these places of wor­ship for at least a day, re­sult­ing in the can­cel­la­tion of prayers and other ac­tiv­i­ties. Any major spike or pro­lif­er­a­tion of clus­ters could lead to the re-im­po­si­tion of lock­down mea­sures at even greater cost.</p>
    <p>With the start of the school hol­i­days and as the fes­tive sea­son nears, Sin­ga­pore­ans should learn from coun­tries and ter­ri­to­ries such as South Korea and Hong Kong, which seemed to have mat­ters well un­der con­trol only to ex­pe­ri­ence sig­nif­i­cant spikes when re­stric­tions were eased. As res­i­dents here take chil­dren for stay­ca­tions or gather to cel­e­brate with fam­ily and friends, they must ex­er­cise so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity and not let their guard down. The new year prom­ises to be brighter than 2020 as vac­cines her­ald a time when life can be­come more nor­mal. But care­less ac­tions can jeop­ar­dise all that. Sin­ga­pore­ans would do well to act re­spon­si­bly if they do not want to see out the year in very much the same way that it be­gan.</p>
