    <p>The China-US re­la­tion­ship has not faced a more chal­leng­ing time since the nor­mal­i­sa­tion of ties 40 years ago and the main rea­son is the new round of McCarthy­ism in the United States that is cre­at­ing a red ter­ror, a Chi­nese an­a­lyst has said.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent sit­u­a­tion of the China-US re­la­tion­ship gives no cause for op­ti­mism. It is at a cross­roads,” said Dr Ruan Zongze, ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent of the China In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies (CIIS), the think-tank of China’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs. He was speak­ing to re­porters yes­ter­day at an on­line press sa­lon or­gan­ised by the All-China Journalist­s As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi said in a video con­fer­ence with his Ger­man coun­ter­part yes­ter­day that the US had caused the cur­rent ten­sion in ties in or­der to halt China’s de­vel­op­men­tal progress. But he said China hoped to achieve win-win co­op­er­a­tion with the US while firmly safe­guard­ing its le­git­i­mate right to de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>McCarthy­ism was a pe­riod in US his­tory in the 1950s dur­ing which se­na­tor Joseph McCarthy launched a se­ries of in­ves­ti­ga­tions and hear­ings in an ef­fort to ex­pose the sup­posed com­mu­nist in­fil­tra­tion of var­i­ous parts of the US gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Ruan’s ref­er­ence to this pe­riod comes as the US ear­lier this week or­dered the clo­sure of the Chi­nese con­sulate in Hous­ton, Texas, within 72 hours.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Se­na­tor Marco Ru­bio called it the “cen­tral node” of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s (CCP) “vast net­work of spies and in­flu­ence oper­a­tions” in the US.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo also at­tacked the CCP in a speech on Thurs­day, call­ing on the Chi­nese peo­ple and “free na­tions of the world” to change the be­hav­iour of China’s rul­ing party. “If the free world doesn’t change com­mu­nist China, com­mu­nist China will surely change us,” he warned.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Dr Ruan noted that in 1972, when the US-China de­tente started with then Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Richard Nixon’s visit to China, the two sides had stated clearly in their joint com­mu­nique their dif­fer­ent po­lit­i­cal sys­tems. He said this dif­fer­ence had not posed an ob­sta­cle to their mul­ti­fac­eted co­op­er­a­tion through the decades.</p>
    <p>In ex­plain­ing the de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in re­la­tions over the past few years, Pro­fes­sor Jia Qing­guo of Pek­ing Univer­sity said at a we­bi­nar on Thurs­day, or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Press Foun­da­tion of the US, that China had not de­vel­oped ac­cord­ing to the ex­pec­ta­tion of the Amer­i­cans. In­stead of be­com­ing more like the US, China has be­come less like it, es­pe­cially in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans are frus­trated and con­cerned with this, par­tic­u­larly in the face of China’s rise, and they “be­gin to imag­ine and ex­ag­ger­ate what this China can do to the US”, he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Jia said, how­ever, that the two sides are not yet in a Cold War.</p>
    <p>If a Cold War is de­fined as ide­o­log­i­cal ri­valry, mil­i­tary con­fronta­tion and eco­nomic sep­a­ra­tion – as was the case be­tween the US and the Soviet Union from 1947 to 1991 – “I don’t think we are quite there yet,” he said. This is be­cause China has not come up with an ide­ol­ogy to ri­val the US’ and, apart from some skir­mishes in the South China Sea, the two sides are not en­gaged in all-out mil­i­tary con­fronta­tion. “And de­spite the trade and tech war, our economies are still very much con­nected and in­ter­twined,” he pointed out.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he warned that the two sides are headed in the di­rec­tion of a Cold War at ac­cel­er­ated speed “thanks to the</p>
    <p>Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion”.</p>
    <p>“If the cur­rent mo­men­tum con­tin­ues, I think the two coun­tries are likely to end up in a Cold War and maybe even in a hot war,” he said.</p>
    <p>He called for cool heads to pre­vail and for both sides to ex­am­ine their re­la­tion­ship, adding that while they have dif­fer­ent po­lit­i­cal sys­tems, they also want the same things in­clud­ing peace and sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Dr Ruan, for his part, saw the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion as “ab­nor­mal” and a “short-term phe­nom­e­non” and ex­pressed con­fi­dence in the re­turn of friendly co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>His col­league at CIIS, Ms Shen Yamei of the depart­ment of Amer­i­can stud­ies, said at the same press event that in the long term, co­op­er­a­tion would be the es­sen­tial as­pect of China-US ties, as has been the case in the past 40 years.</p>
    <p>“There have been fric­tions of one kind or an­other, but in the end, the two sides through di­a­logue and co­op­er­a­tion were able to re­solve var­i­ous kinds of prob­lems,” she said.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, as ten­sion es­ca­lates, China is not sit­ting on its hands. It has pro­posed di­a­logue and co­op­er­a­tion to stop the down­ward slide of re­la­tions, noted Dr Ruan.</p>
    <p>At the same time, it will “firmly safe­guard its le­git­i­mate rights and in­ter­ests”. “In the face of the US’ un­rea­son­able provo­ca­tion and ex­treme ac­tions, China will strike back in a firm, strong and re­cip­ro­cal man­ner,” said Dr Ruan.</p>
