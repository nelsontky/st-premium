    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) is creat­ing a health and safety frame­work that will al­low for “cruises to nowhere” de­part­ing from Sin­ga­pore, in what could be the first step to­wards re­sum­ing leisure travel.</p>
    <p>On Wednesday last week, it ap­pointed clas­si­fi­ca­tion so­ci­ety DNV GL Sin­ga­pore to cre­ate a cruise com­pli­ance au­dit and cer­ti­fi­ca­tion pro­gramme for cruise lines that want to restart sail­ings from the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>Cruise ships have not been al­lowed to call here since March 13.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to ten­der doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times, STB plans to al­low “cruise to nowhere” sail­ings out of Sin­ga­pore, with a max­i­mum ca­pac­ity of 50 per cent of the usual ca­pac­ity for the first three months when sail­ings re­sume. It did not spec­ify when this would be.</p>
    <p>To pre­pare for this, it is work­ing with DNV GL to es­tab­lish a cruise cer­ti­fi­ca­tion pro­gramme bench­marked against global health, safety and hy­giene stan­dards.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of coun­tries closed their ports to cruise ves­sels ear­lier this year af­ter the rapid spread of the coro­n­avirus aboard the Di­a­mond Princess, which was quar­an­tined off the coast of Ja­pan in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>DNV GL will cre­ate a set of health and safety pro­to­cols, con­duct com­pli­ance au­dits and cer­tify cruise ships that meet re­quire­ments. It will also de­velop a penalty frame­work for non-com­pli­ance with safety man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>All cruise lines must be audited and re­ceive cer­ti­fi­ca­tion to sail out of Sin­ga­pore, STB said in the ten­der doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms An­nie Chang, STB’s cruise direc­tor, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion will serve as a qual­ity mark to as­sure pas­sen­gers that the cruise has met re­quired safety and hy­giene stan­dards. More de­tails will be an­nounced later, she added.</p>
    <p>Chan Broth­ers Travel said it will be part­ner­ing Dream Cruises to mar­ket and sell “cruises to nowhere” from Sin­ga­pore, though sales have not yet been launched.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Cruise Lines, which op­er­ates the Star, Dream and Crys­tal Cruises brands, has been op­er­at­ing is­land-hop­ping cruises in Tai­wan since July. It did not re­spond to queries.</p>
    <p>Cruis­ing re­mains on pause in much of the world as the in­dus­try seeks to de­velop a set of health and safety norms that will pre­vent on­board out­breaks and con­vince port au­thor­i­ties to re­open cruise traf­fic.</p>
    <p>Ms Angie Stephen, Royal Caribbean Group’s Asia-Pa­cific man­ag­ing direc­tor, said its ships will fea­ture up­graded air fil­tra­tion sys­tems and other health and safety mea­sures when they re­turn to ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Asked whether it will be seek­ing cer­ti­fi­ca­tion to sail out of Sin­ga­pore, Ms Stephen said the cruise line will work closely with the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to im­ple­ment nec­es­sary re­quire­ments and an­nounce cruises af­ter re­ceiv­ing ap­proval to re­sume.</p>
    <p>Nor­we­gian Cruise Line did not re­spond to queries on whether it plans to at­tain cer­ti­fi­ca­tion or of­fer “cruise to nowhere” itin­er­ar­ies here.</p>
    <p>Celebrity Cruises also de­clined to com­ment, say­ing that its sail­ings re­main sus­pended world­wide un­til Oct 31.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Princess Cruises said its global op­er­a­tions will be paused un­til mid-De­cem­ber, and a re­turn to ser­vice op­er­a­tions in­volv­ing pub­lic health and safety pro­to­cols has yet to be for­malised.</p>
