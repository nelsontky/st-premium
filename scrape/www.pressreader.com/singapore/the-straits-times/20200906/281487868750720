    <p>In­dia has be­come the third coun­try to record more than four mil­lion coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, set­ting a new daily record yes­ter­day, with no signs yet of the cri­sis abat­ing.</p>
    <p>The 86,432 cases recorded in 24 hours un­til 8am yes­ter­day – the high­est for any coun­try since the pan­demic be­gan and more than China’s grand to­tal of 85,112 – took In­dia’s tally to 4,023,179 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Wor­ry­ingly, the coun­try took just 13 days to go from three mil­lion to four mil­lion cases. It re­ported its first case on Jan 30 and reached one mil­lion cases more than five months later on July 16. It is now third, be­hind the United States, which has more than 6.1 mil­lion cases, and Brazil, which has 4.1 mil­lion, a num­ber In­dia could sur­pass this week at cur­rent growth rates.</p>
    <p>The rapid rise in cases in In­dia comes at a time when the in­fec­tion has re­gained mo­men­tum in other coun­tries too.</p>
    <p>France, for in­stance, reg­is­tered nearly 9,000 new coro­n­avirus cases be­tween last Thurs­day and Fri­day, its high­est daily fig­ure since the pan­demic hit the coun­try in March. Cases in Hun­gary rose by a record 510 yes­ter­day and three peo­ple died as the pan­demic gained strength in the east­ern part of Europe. And cases in In­done­sia rose by more than 3,000 for the fourth con­sec­u­tive day.</p>
    <p>Wide­spread vac­ci­na­tions against Covid-19, mean­while, are not ex­pected un­til the mid­dle of next year, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Dileep Mavalankar, di­rec­tor of the In­dian In­sti­tute of Pub­lic Health in Gand­hi­na­gar, Gu­jarat, told The Sun­day Times it is very dif­fi­cult to pre­vent fur­ther spread of the in­fec­tion in In­dia at this stage as the chains of trans­mis­sion are un­clear. “If the coun­try’s top politi­cians as well as a top ac­tor like Amitabh Bachchan could get in­fected de­spite all the pro­tec­tion they must have, how are you go­ing to pro­tect the com­mon man, who needs to be out work­ing?” he said.</p>
    <p>The bright spot is that In­dia’s recorded deaths, at 69,561, are low and govern­ment of­fi­cials have cited its low case fa­tal­ity rate – at 1.73 per cent – as a pos­i­tive sign. Brazil has re­ported more than 125,000 deaths and the US over 186,000.</p>
    <p>“The main ef­fort now should be in re­duc­ing mor­tal­ity and pro­tect­ing the most vul­ner­a­ble,” said Dr Mavalankar, not­ing that mor­tal­ity is low among the young and that those most at risk are aged over 60 with un­der­ly­ing dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The record daily spike comes at a time when In­dia will see wider re­lax­ations kick in. Metro ser­vices re­sume this week in cities and so­cial gath­er­ings of up to 100 peo­ple can go ahead from Sept 21. There are also con­cerns around be­havioural fa­tigue that has set in, lead­ing many Indians to widely dis­re­gard rules man­dat­ing the wear­ing of masks and phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>While some of the big­ger cities that were hard hit in the ini­tial phase of the pan­demic may have gone on to at­tain some level of herd im­mu­nity – a sero­log­i­cal sur­vey in July found nearly six in 10 of slum dwellers in Mumbai had had the in­fec­tion – the virus is now spread­ing into smaller towns and ru­ral ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Most of the cases are be­ing re­ported from the states of Ma­ha­rash­tra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kar­nataka and Ut­tar Pradesh, with data in­di­cat­ing the virus’ spread into smaller towns in these states.</p>
    <p>Dr Manoj Murhekar, a mem­ber of In­dia’s main coro­n­avirus task force and di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Epi­demi­ol­ogy, told The Sun­day Times that the coun­try’s fo­cus now should be on in­creas­ing beds with piped oxy­gen fa­cil­ity in smaller towns and dis­trict head­quar­ters that are ex­pected to see an in­crease in cases. “We must en­sure hos­pi­tals are not get­ting over­whelmed by hos­pi­tal­is­ing the high-risks and home­iso­lat­ing the mild cases,” he said.</p>
    <p>The num­bers are also set to rise fur­ther as the govern­ment ramps up test­ing. More than one mil­lion sam­ples are be­ing tested daily and In­dia said on Fri­day it would al­low on-de­mand test­ing for ev­ery­body.</p>
