    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s old­est ar­chi­tec­tural prac­tice Swan & Ma­claren has, af­ter more than 120 years, fi­nally pub­lished a com­pre­hen­sive tome of its works from 1892 till to­day.</p>
    <p>Writ­ten by ar­chi­tec­tural his­to­rian and an­thro­pol­o­gist Ju­lian Dav­i­son, Swan & Ma­claren: A Story Of Sin­ga­pore Ar­chi­tec­ture is a hefty 440-page glossy cof­fee-ta­ble col­lectible jointly pub­lished with the National Ar­chives of Sin­ga­pore (NAS).</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore firm, which was es­tab­lished when the coun­try was a Bri­tish colony, dom­i­nated the ar­chi­tec­tural com­mu­nity here from 1892 to 1942, with defin­ing works such as Raf­fles Ho­tel (1897), Vic­to­ria Me­mo­rial Hall and The­atre (1902) and Masjid Sul­tan (1924). It started as a part­ner­ship be­tween sur­veyor en­gi­neers Archibald Swan and James Wad­dell Boyd Ma­claren in 1892.</p>
    <p>Be­sides its sem­i­nal colo­nial-era de­signs, Swan & Ma­claren has also made for­ays into Modernist ar­chi­tec­ture such as Raf­fles Med­i­cal Cen­tre (2016) and Hol­land V Re­tail Cen­tre (2018).</p>
    <p>Dr Dav­i­son’s crafted style not only gives stu­dents of ar­chi­tec­ture an au­thor­i­ta­tive grand tour of his­tory, but is also likely to ap­peal to any­one who en­joys leaf­ing through the pages of Sin­ga­pore’s past.</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ing anec­dotes on the early ar­chi­tects who shaped the Sin­ga­pore sky­line are spliced with hun­dreds of archival im­ages, many of which were un­til now locked away in pri­vate col­lec­tions.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Mr Glen Chris­tian, step-grand­son of De­nis Santry, one of the great names in Sin­ga­pore ar­chi­tec­ture whose works ap­peared be­tween the world wars, shared 68 never-be­fore-pub­lished photo prints of build­ings de­signed by Swan & Ma­claren taken at the time of their com­ple­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Dav­i­son, 64, tells The Straits Times that although the book is an ar­chi­tec­tural mono­graph – the his­tory of a sin­gle ar­chi­tec­tural prac­tice – it is much more than sim­ply about bricks and mor­tar.</p>
    <p>“It is also a so­cial his­tory that tells the story of how these build­ings came to be built – the eco­nomic and his­tor­i­cal cir­cum­stances that gave rise to them, the men or cor­po­ra­tions that com­mis­sioned them, the men who de­signed them, the ideas and as­pi­ra­tions man­i­fest in the style of ar­chi­tec­ture, their re­cep­tion in the eyes of the pub­lic and so on.”</p>
    <p>The Bri­ton, who has been based in Sin­ga­pore for the last 30 years, has also au­thored other ar­chi­tec­ture books such as Sin­ga­pore Shop­house (2011) and Black And White: The Sin­ga­pore House 1898-1941 (2006). His fa­ther, Mr Robert Dav­i­son, was one of the found­ing part­ners of the ar­chi­tec­ture firm Raglan Squire & Part­ners (now RSP Ar­chi­tects Plan­ners & En­gi­neers).</p>
    <p>The book project by Swan & Ma­claren, which also has of­fices in Malaysia, Viet­nam, Thai­land and China, started five years ago.</p>
    <p>Group di­rec­tor Lim Chai Boon and di­rec­tor Chris Flan­nery first dis­cussed it with the in­ten­tion of fea­tur­ing the firm’s works from 1892 to 1965. But the amount of in­for­ma­tion re­searched up to the be­gin­ning of World War II was more than enough to fill two books con­tain­ing about 400 pages each.</p>
    <p>Dr Dav­i­son be­gan work on the book in mid-2015 and added the fin­ish­ing touches in Septem­ber last year, with help from re­searchers from NAS and National Li­brary Board (NLB). NAS also made avail­able its ex­haus­tive col­lec­tion of ar­chi­tec­tural draw­ings and archival pho­to­graphs.</p>
    <p>“In­sti­tu­tions such as NAS and NLB are an in­cred­i­bly valu­able re­source for us for un­der­stand­ing the past and re­tain­ing our present for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions,” says Mr Flan­nery, who ex­pects the book to be in stores by the end of the month.</p>
    <p>“With­out them, this story would not have been pos­si­ble to tell.”</p>
    <p>In the book, Dr Dav­i­son also draws at­ten­tion to Swan & Ma­claren’s in­trigu­ing mix of clients.</p>
    <p>They did not hail from the Bri­tish es­tab­lish­ment but were mem­bers of Sin­ga­pore’s Asian elite – such as busi­ness­men Eu Tong Sen and Tan Kah Kee, the Sul­tan of Jo­hor as well as the Alkaffs and Al­sagoffs, two of the coun­try’s wealth­i­est Arab fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just a story about dead white men,” Dr Dav­i­son says.</p>
