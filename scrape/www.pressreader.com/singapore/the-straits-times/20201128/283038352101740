    <p>We bought this leafy hardy plant (right) from the mar­ket. The leaves seem down­cast at night, but come alive the next morn­ing. What is its name?</p>
    <p>Jef­frey Lim</p>
    <p>The plant is botan­i­cally known as Oh­wia cau­data and has no com­mon names.</p>
    <p>It is a type of Tick Trefoil that is sold in lo­cal nurs­eries as a medic­i­nal plant. Its fruit have very fine hair on the sur­face, which can make them stick to cloth­ing and be car­ried away to new sites.</p>
    <p>It is a legume be­long­ing to the bean fam­ily. Many species of plants in this fam­ily re­spond to light in­ten­sity.</p>
    <p>Un­der dark con­di­tions that are en­coun­tered late in the day, leaves of many legumes fold to­gether. This can be seen in com­mon streetscap­e trees like the Yel­low Flame and Rain Tree in Sin­ga­pore. The more leafy shoots your gin­ger pro­duces, the longer the un­der­ground rhi­zome will be.</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, un­der ideal grow­ing con­di­tions, you can start to har­vest im­ma­ture gin­ger about five months after plant­ing and eight months or so for ma­ture gin­ger rhi­zomes.</p>
    <p>The plant grow­ing next to the gin­ger plant is of­ten re­garded as a weed. It is com­monly known as Fox­tail Cop­per­leaf and its botan­i­cal name is Aca­lypha alopecuroi­dea. It pro­duces a rather at­trac­tive green in­flo­res­cence.</p>
