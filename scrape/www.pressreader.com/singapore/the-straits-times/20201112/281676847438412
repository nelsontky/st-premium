    <p>The move to re­open schools in In­dia has hit a set­back fol­low­ing re­ports of hun­dreds of Covid-19 cases among teach­ers as well as chil­dren in re­cent weeks in some states, in­clud­ing Hi­machal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Ut­tarak­hand and Mi­zo­ram.</p>
    <p>This has prompted states to ei­ther shut schools again or fur­ther de­lay their open­ing. Schools were shut across the coun­try in March and re­open­ing them re­mains a pri­or­ity as states are keen to en­sure that chil­dren who are not able to study on­line do not miss out fur­ther on their ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>It was only in Septem­ber that the gov­ern­ment de­cided to al­low schools to re­open from Oct 15 in a grad­ual man­ner based on the lo­cal sit­u­a­tion. But many states have yet to do so as they walk a tightrope, bal­anc­ing ac­cess to ed­u­ca­tion with the need to en­sure the safety of school­child­ren and staff.</p>
    <p>In Hi­machal Pradesh’s Mandi district, where schools re­opened ear­lier this month, more than 100 teach­ers and nearly 80 stu­dents have been in­fected with Covid-19. A res­i­den­tial school for Ti­betans re­ported 99 cases, of which around 70 were stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“The main con­cern is that chil­dren are mi­nors and one may not ex­pect them to ex­er­cise the same level of pre­cau­tion as adults,” Mr</p>
    <p>Rugved Milind Thakur, deputy com­mis­sioner for Mandi district, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“There are pro­to­cols in place (for schools to func­tion amid the pan­demic) and there should not be any prob­lem if th­ese are fol­lowed. But there is al­ways the pos­si­bil­ity that some­one turns pos­i­tive with the kind of spread that is there. An odd in­stance is okay but we should not have large-scale out­breaks,” he added.</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic’s growth in In­dia has slowed in re­cent weeks, there are fears of a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tion. The coun­try has over 8.6 mil­lion con­firmed cases in to­tal.</p>
    <p>States have come up with stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures to pre­vent out­breaks in schools. Com­mon mea­sures in­clude reg­u­lar sani­ti­sa­tion of premises, manda­tory wear­ing of masks and spaced-out seat­ing in class­rooms.</p>
    <p>But the spike in cases at schools has high­lighted de­fi­cien­cies in im­ple­ment­ing th­ese rules, prompt­ing other states to go slow. Odisha last week put on hold a de­ci­sion to re­open schools af­ter Nov 15.</p>
    <p>In Tamil Nadu, a gov­ern­ment de­ci­sion to al­low schools and col­leges to re­open from Nov 16 gen­er­ated wide­spread op­po­si­tion from par­ents. A re­port on on­line news por­tal The News Minute said the Madu­rai bench of Madras High Court, while hear­ing a pe­ti­tion against the gov­ern­ment or­der, rec­om­mended on Nov 11 that ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions re­open af­ter next month.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases have also been re</p>
    <p>ported in Andhra Pradesh, with lo­cal me­dia say­ing as many as 829 teach­ers and 575 stu­dents, all from gov­ern­ment high schools, tested pos­i­tive af­ter schools re­opened on Nov 2.</p>
    <p>In Ut­tarak­hand’s Pauri Garhwal district, more than 80 teach­ers from around 20 dif­fer­ent schools tested pos­i­tive this month. But district chief ed­u­ca­tion of­fi­cer Madan Singh Rawat said no cases had been re­ported among school­child­ren yet. The schools were shut for five days as a pre­cau­tion and have since re­opened.</p>
    <p>In Mi­zo­ram, schools also shut for a few days af­ter they re­opened last month fol­low­ing re­ports of cases among school­child­ren.</p>
    <p>Dr Pachuau Lal­mal­sawma, the spokesman and state’s nodal of­fi­cer for Covid-19, told The Straits Times: “The prob­lem with chil­dren be­ing in­fected in schools is that they can spread the in­fec­tion widely in the com­mu­nity when they re­turn to their homes.”</p>
    <p>There is no cer­tainty over when schools may re­open.</p>
    <p>Many other states have yet to fi­nalise dates for the re­open­ing of schools. While schools are de­mand­ing that they be al­lowed to open, es­pe­cially so that they can catch up on cov­er­ing the syl­labus ahead of key ex­ams for se­nior grades, many par­ents feel they should not re­open even though at­ten­dance re­mains vol­un­tary and pref­er­ence is</p>
    <p>given to on­line ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“Even if 10 out of 40 chil­dren go to school, there is a cer­tain pres­sure that is cre­ated on oth­ers to go,” said Mr Arif Khan, pres­i­dent of the Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion for Par­ents and Stu­dents Rights. The as­so­ci­a­tion has writ­ten to the gov­ern­ment ask­ing it to close schools and con­tinue with on­line ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“We should not be play­ing with our chil­dren’s lives. There should be no lax­ity till a vac­cine is found,” he added, sug­gest­ing that the gov­ern­ment in­stead de­clare this year as a “zero aca­demic year” dur­ing which no aca­demic ac­tiv­i­ties or ex­ams are con­ducted.</p>
