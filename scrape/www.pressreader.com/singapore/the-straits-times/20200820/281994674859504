    <p>It is hardly pos­si­ble to­day to talk about China in South-east Asia with­out talk­ing about the United States as well in South-east Asia. But too many dis­cus­sions of China’s re­la­tions with South-east Asia – in­clud­ing by some South-east Asians who ought to know bet­ter – seem to as­sume that our re­gion is in­hab­ited by mo­rons in­ca­pable of count­ing be­yond two and that the choices fac­ing us are only bi­nary. This is a fun­da­men­tal mis­read­ing of South-east Asia. Only the sim­ple-minded or the par­ti­san as­sume that one must nec­es­sar­ily “win” and the other “lose”, as if the com­plex in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions of the re­gion could be re­duced to a two-horse race.</p>
    <p>As a con­tigu­ous big coun­try, China is al­ways go­ing to be in­flu­en­tial in South-east Asia. For the same rea­son, be­cause it is a con­tigu­ous big coun­try, China is al­ways go­ing to evoke con­cerns in South-east Asia. In this ap­par­ent con­tra­dic­tion lies the essence of the re­la­tion­ship. China’s rise is a geopo­lit­i­cal fact that can­not be ig­nored. China’s rise is chal­leng­ing but re­plete with op­por­tu­nity; China is un­doubt­edly in­flu­en­tial but dis­trusted.</p>
    <p>Big coun­tries, if their in­ten­tions are in­deed be­nign, have a duty to re­as­sure small coun­tries on their pe­riph­ery. This is a duty that China in re­cent years has failed to per­form. On the con­trary, Bei­jing has be­haved ag­gres­sively in pur­suit of its in­ter­ests. There is a cer­tain cul­tural autism in Chi­nese di­plo­macy un­der Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping – man­i­fest pri­mar­ily but not solely in China’s at­ti­tude to­wards the over­seas Chi­nese – that has ac­cen­tu­ated the anx­i­eties.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese di­plo­mats and of­fi­cials some­times seem to think that all they need do is of­fer gen­er­ous aid, trade and in­vest­ment and all will be well. The eco­nomic fac­tor is in­deed cru­cial. But not all South-east Asians are for sale, or if bought, are go­ing to stay bought. China is be­gin­ning to learn that even the ve­nal and cor­rupt can be na­tion­al­ists. Na­tion­al­ism leads South-east Asia to re­gard both China and the US with scep­ti­cism.</p>
    <p>The US too is a geopo­lit­i­cal fact that can­not be ig­nored but is not par­tic­u­larly trusted ei­ther. An “off-shore bal­ancer” is al­ways go­ing to be re­garded war­ily – its friends and al­lies con­stantly os­cil­lat­ing be­tween fears of aban­don­ment and fears of en­tan­gle­ment. These fears have been ac­cen­tu­ated by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, but Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Don­ald Trump did not in­vent them, and Mr Joe Bi­den, if he is elected, is not go­ing to erase them.</p>
    <p>The por­ridge of an off­shore bal­ancer is al­ways go­ing to be too hot or too cold, and no ad­min­is­tra­tion in my ex­pe­ri­ence has ever got the tem­per­a­ture ex­actly right.</p>
    <p>For­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama made el­e­gant speeches but clearly had lit­tle stom­ach for the strate­gic ri­valry that is an in­escapable re­al­ity of ma­jor power re­la­tions in any sys­tem of sov­er­eign states. What­ever you may think of Mr Trump’s ro­bust ap­proach to­wards China, it can­not be ac­cu­rately de­scribed as the “re­treat” that a preva­lent trope would have us be­lieve.</p>
    <p>As the strate­gic cross­roads con­nect­ing the Pa­cific and In­dian Oceans, South-east Asia has al­ways been where the in­ter­ests of ma­jor pow­ers have in­ter­sected and some­times col­lided. Sig­nif­i­cant in­flu­ence is there­fore not ex­clu­sive in­flu­ence or dom­i­nant in­flu­ence. Faced with ma­jor pow­ers that can­not be ig­nored but are not trusted, the coun­tries of South-east Asia are re­spond­ing as they have re­sponded since time im­memo­rial: by danc­ing. And the steps of this diplo­matic dance are in­tri­cate.</p>
    <p>In in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions the­ory, “bal­anc­ing”, “hedg­ing” and</p>
    <p>As the strate­gic cross­roads con­nect­ing the Pa­cific and In­dian Oceans, South-east Asia has al­ways been where the in­ter­ests of ma­jor pow­ers have in­ter­sected and some­times col­lided... Faced with ma­jor pow­ers that can­not be ig­nored but are not trusted, the coun­tries of South-east Asia are re­spond­ing as they have re­sponded since time im­memo­rial: by danc­ing. And the steps of this diplo­matic dance are in­tri­cate.</p>
    <p>“band-wag­o­ning” are al­ter­na­tive strate­gies. But the diplo­matic in­stinct of South-east Asia, evolved over cen­turies of liv­ing in the midst of ma­jor power ri­valry, is to do all three si­mul­ta­ne­ously. This is fa­cil­i­tated by the nat­u­ral mul­ti­po­lar­ity of a di­verse Indo-Pa­cific in which a di­verse South-east Asia is the linch­pin.</p>
    <p>The US and China are not the only pow­ers that mat­ter – Ja­pan, In­dia, Aus­tralia, South Korea, Rus­sia, In­done­sia and Viet­nam are not in­con­sid­er­able strate­gic ac­tors in re­gional pol­i­tics. A few Euro­pean coun­tries have the po­ten­tial to join them.</p>
    <p>After the Cold War, Asean en­cour­aged the nat­u­ral mul­ti­po­lar­ity of the re­gion through the estab­lish­ment of fo­rums such as the Asean Re­gional Fo­rum, the East Asia Sum­mit and the Asean De­fence Min­is­ters Meet­ing Plus. They an­chor all the ma­jor pow­ers in South-east Asia by pro­vid­ing them with le­git­i­mate and in­sti­tu­tion­alised means of en­gag­ing the re­gion.</p>
    <p>It is of­ten said that South-east Asia does not want to choose be­tween the US and China and wants to be neu­tral in their dis­putes. This is true. But not choos­ing does not mean lay­ing low and hop­ing for the best. We should not be neu­tral with re­gard to our own in­ter­ests. The re­gion’s mul­ti­po­lar­ity cre­ates agency to pur­sue our own in­ter­ests be­cause it widens the space and op­por­tu­nity for ma­noeu­vre. Of course, whether we have the wit to recog­nise our agency and the courage and agility to use it, is an­other mat­ter. But in prin­ci­ple, agency ex­ists.</p>
    <p>The mul­ti­po­lar­ity of South-east Asia and the Indo-Pa­cific is not to be un­der­stood as a static con­di­tion in which all poles are of equal strate­gic weight. It is asym­met­ri­cal and dy­namic. US-China re­la­tions will form the cen­tral axis around which other coun­tries big and small will con­tin­u­ally ar­range and re­ar­range them­selves in fluid com­bi­na­tions, some­times tilt­ing one way, some­times an­other, as their in­ter­ests in dif­fer­ent do­mains dic­tate. A static align­ment across all do­mains is im­prob­a­ble. This cen­tury will not be de­fined by any sin­gle coun­try.</p>
    <p>• This is an ex­cerpt from a speech he gave at the launch of a book, In The Dragon’s Shadow: South-east Asia In China’s Cen­tury (Yale Uni­ver­sity Press, 2020), by Sebastian Stran­gio. The launch event was or­gan­ised by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Pol­icy Stud­ies, Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
