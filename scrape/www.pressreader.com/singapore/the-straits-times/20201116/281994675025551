    <p>HE FOUND COOK­ING FUN</p>
    <p>I was al­ways bet­ter at hands-on work, rather than study­ing and read­ing books. Cook­ing was in­ter­est­ing, and fun, to me.</p>
    <p>MR SPENCER TAY, who grad­u­ated with a Tech­ni­cal Di­ploma in Culi­nary Arts in 2016.</p>
    <p>When he was only 13, Mr Spencer Tay started de­vour­ing cook­ing shows on TV, a pas­time that stirred in him a pas­sion for cook­ing.</p>
    <p>By 14, he was whip­ping up a braised meat dish with his mother su­per­vis­ing.</p>
    <p>Four years later, he was help­ing out at the bao stall his par­ents ran at a hawker cen­tre in the West Coast area.</p>
    <p>Now a chef de par­tie at the three­Miche­lin-starred Les Amis in Shaw Cen­tre, the 26-year-old said: “I was al­ways bet­ter at hands-on work rather than study­ing and read­ing books. Cook­ing was in­ter­est­ing, and fun, to me.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tay, who grad­u­ated in 2016 with a Tech­ni­cal Di­ploma in Culi­nary Arts from the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE), said it was a nat­u­ral choice for him to pick a Nitec in West­ern Culi­nary Arts course in 2012 after sec­ondary school.</p>
    <p>He even­tu­ally ended up at French culi­nary school In­sti­tut Paul Bo­cuse (IPB) in Lyon, France, where he spent three months on an ex­change pro­gramme in 2013.</p>
    <p>That stint gave him a pre­view of the tech­ni­cal di­ploma pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Con­ducted in col­lab­o­ra­tion with IPB, the pro­gramme, which started in 2011, ac­cepts only a few stu­dents ev­ery year. More than 200 have grad­u­ated from the 21/ 2- year course, which re­ceived its 10th batch of stu­dents this year.</p>
    <p>ITE first signed a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing (MOU) with IPB in 2008 to con­duct the course, then re­newed it in 2015 for an­other five years. Last Thurs­day, the in­sti­tu­tions re­newed it again for an­other four years.</p>
    <p>At the MOU sign­ing last week, ITE chief ex­ec­u­tive Low Khah Gek said the part­ner­ship has given ITE stu­dents the op­por­tu­nity to hone their craft in France.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of stu­dents com­pleted their fi­nal at­tach­ment in Miche­lin­starred restau­rants such as La Pyra­mide and Chateau de Bag­nols in France, “ex­pos­ing them to a di­verse work­ing cul­ture and un­der­stand­ing of what it takes to be a top chef”, said Ms Low.</p>
    <p>Mr Do­minique Gi­raudier, chief ex­ec­u­tive of IPB, said: “I know that we have learnt a lot from each other and that we have been in­spired by each other. In a way, it is al­ready a win-win sit­u­a­tion and we have to go even fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tay re­called in­tern­ing in 2015 at French fine din­ing restau­rant Les Amis in Sin­ga­pore dur­ing the tech­ni­cal di­ploma pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary last year, he re­turned to the restau­rant as a full-time em­ployee. This was after grad­u­at­ing in 2016 and ful­fill­ing his two years of na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, he plays the role of an aboyeur – some­one who ac­cepts or­ders from the din­ing room, re­lays them to the ap­pro­pri­ate sta­tions of the kitchen and checks each plate be­fore it leaves the kitchen.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay said that work­ing in a top restau­rant is not as stress­ful as one would imag­ine.</p>
    <p>“In our restau­rant, we do the same things (in our roles) ev­ery day. When we’ve mas­tered them, we may move on to other roles. The tech­niques I learnt in ITE have re­ally boosted my con­fi­dence.”</p>
    <p>Mr Se­bastien Lepinoy, di­rec­tor of culi­nary and op­er­a­tions at Les</p>
    <p>Amis Restau­rant, said he has been very im­pressed by ITE stu­dents from the tech­ni­cal di­ploma pro­gramme who have in­terned at the restau­rant.</p>
    <p>“The stu­dents who join us are pas­sion­ate, hard-work­ing, and are more than will­ing to learn and ask ques­tions to im­prove their craft... Hav­ing a good foun­da­tion al­lows them to adapt very quickly to their role and the pace in my kitchen.”</p>
