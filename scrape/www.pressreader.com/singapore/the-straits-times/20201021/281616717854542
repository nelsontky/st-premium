    <p>For­mer Tem­busu Col­lege don Jeremy Fer­nando, who was fired amid sex­ual mis­con­duct al­le­ga­tions, had openly dis­cussed the idea of sex­ual re­la­tion­ships be­tween teach­ers and stu­dents. In a pa­per that was part of his 2017 book, he wrote that “in­sem­i­na­tion” can be a part of teach­ing and could open up stu­dents and teach­ers to pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>For­mer Tem­busu Col­lege don Jeremy Fer­nando, who was fired amid sex­ual mis­con­duct al­le­ga­tions, had openly dis­cussed the idea of sex­ual re­la­tion­ships be­tween teach­ers and stu­dents.</p>
    <p>In a pa­per which was part of his 2017 book, Why Hasn’t JB Al­ready Dis­ap­peared, he wrote that “in­sem­i­na­tion” can be a part of teach­ing and could open up stu­dents and teach­ers to pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In the pa­per ti­tled Teach Me Tonight, read by The Straits Times, the aca­demic wrote: “Teach­ing in­volves dis­sem­i­na­tion, spread­ing, grow­ing, ger­mi­na­tion, trim­ming, cut­ting, prun­ing – quite pos­si­bly, in­sem­i­na­tion... And, a cat­e­gor­i­cal dis­missal of the po­ten­tial re­la­tion­al­ity be­tween a stu­dent and a teacher – even if this re­la­tion­ship ex­tends to a sex­ual na­ture – is to make teach­ing a mere pro­fes­sion.”</p>
    <p>Dr Fer­nando was a fel­low at Tem­busu Col­lege when the aca­demic book was pub­lished in 2017.</p>
    <p>He taught cross-dis­ci­plinary mod­ules at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), pri­mar­ily fo­cus­ing on phi­los­o­phy and lit­er­a­ture. The “JB” in the book’s ti­tle refers to French philoso­pher Jean Bau­drillard.</p>
    <p>In the pa­per, which be­gins with Dr Fer­nando dis­cussing sex-for­grades scan­dals, he ar­gues that teach­ing and learn­ing take place in the bod­ies of the stu­dents and teach­ers, and that love is the con­di­tion of learn­ing.</p>
    <p>He adds that teach­ing does not al­ways en­tail sex, and dis­cern­ment is a mark of in­tel­li­gence. How­ever, the abil­ity to make this choice comes only af­ter be­ing open to the pos­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The pa­per was high­lighted by a for­mer stu­dent of Dr Fer­nando who, along with other for­mer stu­dents, told ST that the stu­dent com­mu­nity has been out­raged and dis­gusted by the al­le­ga­tions, given that the for­mer mem­ber of the teach­ing staff was friendly and openly sup­ported gen­der rights.</p>
    <p>The for­mer stu­dent, who is in his early 20s and de­clined to be named, said that with hind­sight, there were warn­ing signs.</p>
    <p>He added that Dr Fer­nando used to en­joy dis­cussing push­ing moral bound­aries.</p>
    <p>An­other for­mer stu­dent, 21, who also de­clined to be named, said: “Shock is an un­der­state­ment; it feels like the col­lege, and es­pe­cially the se­niors, are go­ing through a col­lec­tive trauma of feel­ing be­trayed.</p>
    <p>“His very per­sona seemed to go against all no­tions of toxic mas­culin­ity... To find out that he wasn’t who he claimed to be all this while was dis­tress­ing.”</p>
    <p>She said he formed close friend­ships with some stu­dents who liked his philo­soph­i­cal way of teach­ing and talk­ing.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause peo­ple in the hu­man­i­ties are usu­ally more lib­eral, it was easy to be­lieve that he’s an open and ac­cept­ing per­son,” she said.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral for­mer stu­dents re­called that he had even helmed and crafted a com­pul­sory mod­ule on re­spect and con­sent for stu­dents at the univer­sity af­ter then NUS un­der­grad­u­ate Mon­ica Baey went pub­lic last year with her ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing a sur­vivor of voyeurism in 2018.</p>
    <p>Ms Baey was filmed in a Eu­soff Hall shower in Novem­ber 2018 by fel­low stu­dent Ni­cholas Lim, who was then 23. She later took to so­cial me­dia to ex­press her anger when she felt that NUS did not pun­ish him ad­e­quately.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the pub­lic out­cry, NUS and other uni­ver­si­ties made changes to strengthen their dis­ci­plinary frame­works against those who com­mit sex­ual of­fences on cam­pus and shore up sup­port for vic­tims of such of­fences.</p>
    <p>FIRED AF­TER IN­VES­TI­GA­TION</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, it emerged that NUS had fired Dr Fer­nando af­ter in­ves­ti­gat­ing com­plaints that he en­gaged in sex­ual mis­con­duct with two stu­dents.</p>
    <p>While ST un­der­stands a po­lice re­port has not been filed, the two un­der­grad­u­ate women in­volved, who wished nei­ther to be named nor to re­veal their ages, had re­ported the is­sue to the col­lege.</p>
    <p>One of the women al­leged that Dr Fer­nando made non-con­sen­sual sex­ual ad­vances, such as kiss­ing and grop­ing her, and per­formed oral sex while she was drunk.</p>
    <p>The other woman al­leged that he tried touch­ing her and kiss­ing her, and asked her to keep it quiet, telling her he would lose his job if she did not.</p>
    <p>Dr Fer­nando did not re­spond to queries from ST.</p>
