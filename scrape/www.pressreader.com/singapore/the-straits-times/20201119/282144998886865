    <p>A woman who re­peat­edly abused her fam­ily’s In­done­sian do­mes­tic helper, be­fore the vic­tim fled by climb­ing down 15 storeys via sev­eral bal­conies, has been sen­tenced to 10 months and two weeks’ jail.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Jan­uary and April 2018, Nuur Au­dadi Yu­soff tor­mented Ms Sulis Se­ty­owati, 24, mul­ti­ple times, in­clud­ing by slap­ping her face and pulling her hair.</p>
    <p>In pass­ing sen­tence yes­ter­day, District Judge Ron­ald Gwee said that the phys­i­cal abuse and men­tal harm Nuur caused “speak for them­selves”. He also noted that Ms Sulis risked her life to es­cape the “tor­ture”.</p>
    <p>The judge said that a de­ter­rent sen­tence was nec­es­sary to send a mes­sage that such acts of cru­elty are not ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Nuur gave</p>
    <p>Ms Sulis more than $7,000 as com­pen­sa­tion a few days ago.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty in Septem­ber to six counts of as­sault. Nine other charges, mainly for sim­i­lar of­fences, were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>At the time of the of­fences, Nuur was a Sing­tel em­ployee de­ployed to sup­port a Min­istry of Man­power con­tact cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Ms Sulis started work­ing at Nuur’s Yishun flat in De­cem­ber 2017. Some time after mid­night the fol­low­ing month, Nuur was awak­ened by her daugh­ter’s cries and found that Ms Sulis had for­got­ten to ap­ply oint­ment on the child’s ab­domen.</p>
    <p>Nuur then spat at the maid and slapped her twice on the face. The abuse con­tin­ued in Fe­bru­ary 2018 with acts such as drag­ging the maid by her hair.</p>
    <p>When Ms Sulis re­quested a trans­fer, Nuur promised not to hit her again. But the abuse re­sumed on</p>
    <p>April 21 that year after she scrolled through Ms Sulis’ mo­bile phone. Nuur found that the maid had up­loaded pic­tures of her chil­dren on Face­book.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Chong Kee En said that Nuur then as­saulted the maid. The court heard that Nuur con­fis­cated the phone and as­saulted the maid al­most daily for about a week after the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>On April 29 that year, Ms Sulis man­aged to re­trieve her mo­bile phone and hid it as she wanted to call her agency to ask for a trans­fer.</p>
    <p>Ms Sulis was sit­ting on the floor the next day when Nuur pulled her hair and kicked her head a few times be­fore leav­ing for work.</p>
    <p>Ms Sulis de­cided to run away around 2am on May 1, 2018, and es­caped through the bal­cony as the front door was locked.</p>
    <p>The DPP had ear­lier said: “She climbed down 15 storeys, clam­ber­ing down bal­cony by bal­cony, be­fore she man­aged to reach the ground floor. The climb took her all of early morn­ing.”</p>
    <p>On the ad­vice of her agent, she lodged a po­lice re­port that af­ter­noon, said the DPP. Ms Sulis later went to Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal, where she was di­ag­nosed with bruises and wounds.</p>
