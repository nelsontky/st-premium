    <p>LON­DON • The United States and Bri­tain ex­pressed op­ti­mism about the prospects of a trade deal as they launched the lat­est round of talks fo­cused on goods and tar­iffs.</p>
    <p>US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Robert Lighthizer told a se­cu­rity con­fer­ence on Tues­day that he was “very pleased” with progress in ne­go­ti­a­tions with Bri­tain and pre­dicted a trade deal “rea­son­ably soon”.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Trade Min­is­ter Liz Truss said the two sides were in­ten­si­fy­ing talks as they en­ter a fifth round.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has put a US trade deal at the top of its post-Brexit wish list, hav­ing cited the free­dom to strike bi­lat­eral deals as one of the main ben­e­fits of leav­ing the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>No tar­get date for an agree­ment has been set, how­ever, and Ms Truss has had to re­but op­po­si­tion crit­i­cism that a deal would mean low­er­ing food stan­dards and al­low­ing US com­pa­nies ac­cess to the Bri­tish health sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mr Lighthizer, speak­ing by video link from Wash­ing­ton to a Bri­tish gov­ern­ment con­fer­ence on transat­lantic co­op­er­a­tion, said talks were tak­ing place con­tin­u­ously.</p>
    <p>“These things take time... but we are mak­ing great head­way and we have 30-some­thing groups ne­go­ti­at­ing and ne­go­ti­at­ing right now,” he told the At­lantic Fu­ture Fo­rum.</p>
    <p>“I am op­ti­mistic across the board and I think that it is go­ing to hap­pen rea­son­ably soon.”</p>
    <p>Ms Truss, speak­ing by re­mote link to the same con­fer­ence, said western port ci­ties like Liver­pool would ben­e­fit from a US trade deal as Bri­tain widens its gaze be­yond a 45-year-old bias in favour of trade ties with the EU.</p>
    <p>The tone of the pub­lic ex­change con­trasted with a stand-off be­tween Lon­don and Brus­sels over Bri­tain’s fu­ture trade ties with the EU fol­low­ing its exit from the bloc in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The EU told Bri­tain yes­ter­day to make up its mind on Brexit, putting</p>
    <p>the onus back on Lon­don to un­lock trade talks as the bloc’s chief ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier said an agree­ment was still within reach with 10 weeks to go.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Coun­cil pres­i­dent Charles Michel told the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment: “Time is very short and we stand ready to ne­go­ti­ate 24/7, on all sub­jects, on le­gal texts. The UK has a bit of a de­ci­sion to make and it’s their free and sovereign choice.”</p>
    <p>Lon­don this week re­fused to con­tinue full ne­go­ti­a­tions, say­ing the</p>
    <p>EU must “fun­da­men­tally change” its stance. The bloc, while see­ing this as bluff by Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son, has also ex­tended an olive branch by talk­ing up Bri­tish sovereignt­y, as well as the EU’s open­ness to dis­cuss in­ten­sively, across the board and on spe­cific le­gal texts.</p>
    <p>A Bri­tish gov­ern­ment spokesman said Lon­don noted “with in­ter­est” Mr Barnier’s com­ments that touch “in a sig­nif­i­cant way on the is­sues be­hind the cur­rent dif­fi­cul­ties in our talks”.</p>
    <p>Mr Barnier and his Bri­tish coun­ter­part David Frost were due to talk fur­ther yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Lighthizer, who has named the Bri­tish trade talks as one of his top pri­or­i­ties for this year, has called for full ac­cess for US agri­cul­tural prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The two sides are seen at odds, how­ever, over tar­iffs in­clud­ing US steel and alu­minium du­ties im­posed in 2018.</p>
    <p>A grow­ing po­ten­tial flash­point con­cerns Bri­tain’s close links to jet­maker Air­bus, which is at the cen­tre of a 16-year-old transat­lantic trade spat over air­craft sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>The EU has won the right to hit back with tar­iffs on Amer­i­can goods to pun­ish US sub­si­dies to air­craft man­u­fac­turer Boe­ing – a year af­ter Wash­ing­ton slapped du­ties on EU goods over sub­si­dies granted to Air­bus by Bri­tain, France, Ger­many and Spain.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has said Wash­ing­ton will “strike back harder” at any Euro­pean tar­iffs.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said Bri­tain is squeezed be­tween ap­ply­ing its share of the tar­iffs in de­fence of Air­bus and risk­ing a set­back in trade talks with the US, or de­lay­ing them and fur­ther cor­rod­ing tense talks over a Euro­pean trade deal.</p>
