In such instances, a dashboard camera can be useful to have as it captures continuous footage of incidents happening at the front and rear of your vehicle.
In the event of an accident, the footage captured acts as a form of evidence to support the driver’s side of the story.
It can also be helpful if the driver faces disputes over accident claims.
