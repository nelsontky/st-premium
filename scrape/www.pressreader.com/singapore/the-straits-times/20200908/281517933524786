    <p>Even for the ex­cep­tional No­vak Djokovic there must be no ex­cep­tions. A rule bro­ken must bring a penalty and a lineswoman hit in ten­nis is worth dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion. A man of mostly im­mac­u­late con­trol with a racket must pay for his griev­ous loss of it.</p>
    <p>Djokovic pulled a ball from his pocket at the US Open, half turned and flicked it in de­ri­sion. Mad­ness un­folded in the frus­trated snap of a tal­ented wrist. He was aim­ing for the back wall, or half-think­ing of giv­ing a ball­boy catch­ing prac­tice, but in­stead hit a lineswoman in the throat. The game’s finest player was inch-im­per­fect.</p>
    <p>His­tory, we know al­ready, is de­cided by tiny mar­gins, by small pieces of bril­liance but also by in­fin­i­tes­i­mal er­rors of judg­ment. The great­est ath­letes have the most ex­tra­or­di­nary lapses. Cristiano Ron­aldo is so gifted he can score any­where, even once into his own goal.</p>
    <p>Djokovic’s year dis­solved on Sun­day in a few sec­onds. Usain Bolt’s once took a frac­tion of that. Nine years ago at the world cham­pi­onships, the Ja­maican false-started in the 100m fi­nal and was sen­sa­tion­ally dis­qual­i­fied. When cham­pi­ons make such blun­ders we are mo­men­tar­ily be­wil­dered and even Walter Dix, the Amer­i­can run­ner who came sec­ond even­tu­ally, told Bri­tish news­pa­per the Tele­graph: “I mean, how can you kick Usain Bolt out of the race?”</p>
    <p>Quite sim­ply it seems.</p>
    <p>If Djokovic was play­ing in an out­side court he would be fine for there are no lines­peo­ple there. One pre­sumes it is le­gal to hit a HawkEye cam­era. The Serb has bounced rack­ets and slapped balls into the stands like most oth­ers – Rafael Nadal is an ex­cep­tion to this rule – but mostly it is a cal­cu­lated fury. Ath­letes know the rules and how far to push them. Then, oc­ca­sion­ally, they go too far.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes have hit of­fi­cials be­fore, in the box­ing ring and fa­mously at the 2008 Olympics when An­gel Valo­dia Matos, a taek­wondo com­peti­tor, kicked a judge de­lib­er­ately in the face af­ter be­ing dis­qual­i­fied. Of course, Djokovic’s act was far less egre­gious and clearly an un­lucky ac­ci­dent but it also in­volved the slip­ping of his com­po­sure. Part of the ath­lete’s job is to hold them­selves to­gether. This time the glue of great­ness came mo­men­tar­ily un­stuck.</p>
    <p>That Djokovic is the No. 1-ranked player in the world and ac­com­pa­nied these days by a shadow of con­ceit makes this story more com­pli­cated. As ten­nis’ finest per­former he is nat­u­rally its stan­dard set­ter, an am­bas­sador who must know that he will be closely and con­stantly scru­ti­nised. Ev­ery small thing mat­ters and by skip­ping a post-match press con­fer­ence it will be said he aban­doned his re­spon­si­bil­ity. If you’re the game’s star, you can wear all the praise but must face the oc­ca­sional mu­sic.</p>
    <p>It has been an awk­wardly bril­liant year for the Serb, for he has been mas­ter­ful be­tween the lines but a vex­ing fig­ure away from them. He has not been le­git­i­mately beaten in 26 matches in 2020 yet has not been com­pletely em­braced. At the Grand Slams, he has not lost to Fed­erer since 2012 and Nadal since 2014, yet that an­cient Spanish-Swiss ro­mance still blinds us to the Serb’s star­tling skill.</p>
    <p>Or that is what Djokovic’s wounded fans will in­sist. They are not en­tirely wrong and yet their hero does not eas­ily en­dear him­self to peo­ple. This year he was in­volved in the Adria Tour which sparked a Covid clus­ter, ques­tioned vac­ci­na­tions and helped form the Pro­fes­sional Ten­nis Play­ers As­so­ci­a­tion which has led to dis­sen­sion in the men’s game. Is he de­ci­sive or di­vi­sive? As­sertive or ar­ro­gant? Mis­un­der­stood or reck­less? The jury is out and now so is he.</p>
    <p>Djokovic is so gifted that some folk were ready to in­scribe his name on the US Open tro­phy be­fore the tour­na­ment even be­gan, an 18th Slam taken for granted in his chase for 21. It takes a rare tal­ent to make peo­ple so cer­tain of you. It also takes an ab­surd mis­take to leave it all in ru­ins.</p>
    <p>In a cruel mod­ern era of re­lent­less so­cial me­dia, where noth­ing is for­got­ten, this stain will stalk Djokovic. De­fi­ance is his style these days, and it works well on court, but hu­mil­ity is the virtue he should try his hand at. There is no one to blame here, af­ter all, but him­self, and the ghost of Roberto de Vi­cenzo would tell him that.</p>
    <p>At the 1968 Masters, af­ter a ter­rific 65 on the fi­nal day, de Vi­cenzo, the reign­ing Bri­tish Open cham­pion, was tied with Bob Goalby and ready­ing for an 18-hole play-off. But his play­ing part­ner had put down the wrong score on a hole and de Vi­cenzo signed for a 66 in­stead of a 65. The rule stated that if you sign for a higher to­tal, then it stands, and he missed the play-off by a stroke.</p>
    <p>Later, the Ar­gen­tinian, a de­cent man now dis­traught, said: “What a stupid I am.”</p>
    <p>It is a per­fect sum­ma­tion of Djokovic’s im­per­fect day.</p>
    <p>In a cruel mod­ern era of re­lent­less so­cial me­dia, where noth­ing is for­got­ten, this stain will stalk Djokovic. De­fi­ance is his style these days, and it works well on court, but hu­mil­ity is the virtue he should try his hand at. There is no one to blame here, af­ter all, but him­self.</p>
