    <p>The roles women play at home and the work­place will be among the top­ics tack­led in a com­pre­hen­sive re­view of is­sues af­fect­ing women, which was an­nounced by Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>In many Asian so­ci­eties, a woman’s place is still seen as the home, not the work­place, said Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem.</p>
    <p>“Women are faced with grow­ing ex­pec­ta­tions from so­ci­ety and from them­selves to do not just a good job, but also an ex­cel­lent job at bal­anc­ing both work and fam­ily,” she added.</p>
    <p>And that is no easy task, mothers told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Ms Ade­lene Chan, 33, a com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager with two chil­dren aged five and two, de­cided to be a stay-at-home mum for two years after her first child was born.</p>
    <p>When she thought about re­turn­ing to work, she was hes­i­tant be­cause she did not know if she could bal­ance a job and moth­er­hood.</p>
    <p>With her hus­band’s en­cour­age­ment, she ap­plied for a full-time job at char­ity Fo­cus on the Fam­ily Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>At the in­ter­view, she met her prospec­tive boss, who had taken her baby to work in a car­rier.</p>
    <p>“I was very en­cour­aged to see that the or­gan­i­sa­tion walked the talk and didn’t dis­crim­i­nate against hav­ing chil­dren in the work­place,” said Ms Chan.</p>
    <p>When she be­came preg­nant a sec­ond time, she con­sid­ered quit­ting but the char­ity of­fered her a flex­i­ble work ar­range­ment of 21/ days a</p>
    <p>2 week, which she took up.</p>
    <p>Ms Lew Ee Ling, 43, di­rec­tor and founder of san­i­tary-ware spe­cial­ist Ei­lu­mina Re­sources, said she is flex­i­ble about work ar­range­ments for staff, given that she has a nineyear-old son her­self.</p>
    <p>They can ei­ther come to the of­fice or work from home, and take time off for child­care, even if it is a last-minute re­quest.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which has an of­fice in China, also has a room for the em­ploy­ees who need to bring their chil­dren to work, said Ms Lew, who is di­vorced.</p>
    <p>“It is a cul­ture that a com­pany has to build. The leader has to pro­mote and ad­vo­cate out­right for such work-life bal­ance and flex­i­bil­ity,” she added.</p>
    <p>Flex­i­bil­ity is key i n help­ing women jug­gle work and do­mes­tic com­mit­ments, noted work-life trainer and con­sul­tant Yeo Miu Ean.</p>
    <p>She is also pres­i­dent of non-profit group Women Em­pow­ered for Work and Mother­ing.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic com­mit­ments can also in­clude car­ing for par­ents, not just chil­dren, given that Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion is age­ing fast, she pointed out.</p>
    <p>Bosses should also al­low flex­i­bil­ity in work tim­ings, place of work and the amount of work­load for their staff.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo added that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has pushed com­pa­nies to let peo­ple work from home, and it is time for them to also look at how to sus­tain the ar­range­ment, as it is one of the best so­lu­tions for women who want to con­tinue work­ing while han­dling care­giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>She said: “This should be a mul­ti­pronged push in­volv­ing the Gov­ern­ment, em­ploy­ers, trade as­so­ci­a­tions, pro­fes­sional as­so­ci­a­tions and civic and com­mu­nity or­gan­i­sa­tions.”</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo, 57, put on hold her plans to pur­sue a master’s de­gree when she had chil­dren. Her two daugh­ters are now 25 and 29.</p>
    <p>She fi­nally found the time to take up the course two years ago, and grad­u­ated in May this year.</p>
    <p>More com­pa­nies are pro­vid­ing flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments and that is a sign that things are mov­ing for­ward, but a mind­set change is still needed, said Mrs Sher-Li Torrey.</p>
    <p>She is the founder and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of ca­reer por­tal Mums@ Work.</p>
    <p>“Even though firms of­fer a choice, there are many cases where women are scared to take it.</p>
    <p>“They feel they may be marginalis­ed or their ca­reer will get side­tracked.</p>
    <p>“This is some­thing that no mat­ter how you leg­is­late, you can’t force a change. Leg­is­la­tion must go hand in hand with a mind­set-change ap­proach,” she said.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ety must be­come more ac­cept­ing of such ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>She noted that in Scan­di­na­vian coun­tries, such leg­is­la­tion is in place, and ci­ti­zens are on board, mak­ing these na­tions well known for their work-life bal­ance.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should also not per­ceive women who pri­ori­tise care­giv­ing as be­ing less fo­cused, or marginalis­e mar­ried or preg­nant women by pass­ing them over for em­ploy­ment or pro­mo­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties, added Mrs Torrey.</p>
    <p>Ms Low noted that Sin­ga­pore em­ploy­ers have taken con­crete steps to cre­ate a friend­lier work en­vi­ron­ment for mothers.</p>
    <p>“But busi­nesses have to see that hir­ing an ex­pec­tant woman is not a li­a­bil­ity as she and the fu­ture baby will be key as­sets for the na­tion – help­ing to boost our pa­thetic fer­til­ity rate,” she added.</p>
    <p>An­other bright spot is that more men are tak­ing up care­giv­ing du­ties, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>The stereo­type that women must care for de­pen­dants and do the house­work while men bring home the ba­con is no longer as preva­lent as be­fore, said hu­man-re­source con­sul­tant Martin Gabriel, founder of HR mat­ters 21.</p>
    <p>“I see the change when I at­tend meet-the-par­ent ses­sions at my chil­dren’s schools. Many fa­thers are there too.”</p>
    <p>In fact, he added, when he was in his late 20s, he did more house­work than his wife as she was earn­ing more than he did.</p>
    <p>Ms Chan said mothers need to let fa­thers take a crack at han­dling the par­ent­ing chores, such as chang­ing di­a­pers, even if their hus-</p>
    <p>This should be a multi-pronged push in­volv­ing the Gov­ern­ment, em­ploy­ers, trade as­so­ci­a­tions, pro­fes­sional as­so­ci­a­tions and civic and com­mu­nity or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>MS YEO MIU EAN, a work-life trainer and con­sul­tant who is also pres­i­dent of non-profit group Women Em­pow­ered for Work and Mother­ing, on how firms should look at how to sus­tain the work-from-home ar­range­ment. Ms Yeo, 57, put on hold her plans for a master’s de­gree when she had chil­dren. Her two daugh­ters are now 25 and 29, and she fi­nally found the time to take up the course two years ago.</p>
    <p>Even though firms of­fer a choice, there are many cases where women are scared to take it. They feel they may be marginalis­ed or their ca­reer will get side­tracked. This is some­thing that no mat­ter how you leg­is­late, you can’t force a change. Leg­is­la­tion must go hand in hand with a mind­set-change ap­proach.</p>
    <p>MRS SHER-LI TORREY, founder and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of ca­reer por­tal Mums@Work, on flex­i­ble work op­tions.</p>
    <p>bands are not very adept at these tasks.</p>
    <p>“If women keep say­ing, ‘ Oh, you’re not so good at it, let me do it’, then mums will only get bet­ter and fa­thers will get worse.</p>
    <p>“Ac­knowl­edge that it is okay to try and fail, then try again, so that both par­ents can work to­gether,” she said.</p>
    <p>One per­sis­tent is­sue is that so­ci­ety does not place enough value on un­paid work such as house­work and tak­ing care of the fam­ily, said Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity so­ci­ol­o­gist Paulin</p>
    <p>Straughan.</p>
    <p>She added: “If we value and val­i­date and re­ward do­mes­tic work, then I imag­ine you won’t have to force or en­cour­age peo­ple to do it; they will nat­u­rally do it.</p>
    <p>“But the way so­ci­ety func­tions, not just in Sin­ga­pore, is that fam­ily work is in­vis­i­ble.</p>
    <p>“Paid work should not in­fringe on pri­vate fam­ily or in­di­vid­ual time be­cause of its ‘higher value’,” said Pro­fes­sor Straughan.</p>
    <p>Ms Low said Sin­ga­pore has “im­ple­mented sev­eral en­hanced ma­ter­nity ben­e­fits and leave schemes for work­ing par­ents, and that parental ben­e­fits con­tinue to im­prove”.</p>
    <p>“Apart from policy shifts, we need to con­sider cul­tural shifts,” she added.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore on the whole needs to learn how to re­spect fam­ily time and rest time to en­sure the well-be­ing of our ci­ti­zens.”</p>
