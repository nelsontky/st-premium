    <p>In the ro­mance K-drama More Than Friends, a woman har­bours a long­stand­ing crush on her high school class­mate de­spite his re­jec­tion. But the ac­tress who plays the role, Shin Ye-eun (He Is Psy­cho­me­t­ric, 2019), says that is some­thing she will never do in real life.</p>
    <p>Here are five things to know about Shin and her costars – idol-ac­tors Ong Seong-wu (At Eigh­teen, 2019) and Kim Dong-jun (Black, 2017) – and their new drama, which is avail­able on Viu.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>NOT A DIE-HARD RO­MAN­TIC</p>
    <p>While her char­ac­ter Woo-yeon may have been in love with Ong’s char­ac­ter Lee Soo for years, the 22-yearold Shin says she is not the kind to hang on to un­re­quited love in real life.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail in­ter­view, she tells The Straits Times: “I am con­fi­dent I can con­tinue lov­ing some­one for a long time if we both are in love with each other, but I think har­bour­ing an un­re­quited love for some­one alone is im­pos­si­ble. That’s why I was amazed by my char­ac­ter Woo-yeon be­cause we have op­po­site per­son­al­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>In the se­ries, Woo-yeon con­fesses her feel­ings to Lee Soo and gets re­jected. Ong, pre­vi­ously a mem­ber of dis­banded boy group Wanna One, says he is not turned off by women who make the first move.</p>
    <p>“I feel that who­ever is sure of his or her own feel­ings and feels com­pelled to ex­press them should be the first to con­fess,” the 25-year-old adds.</p>
    <p>TWIN­NING WITH THEIR ON-SCREEN ROLES</p>
    <p>While Shin says she is the polar op­po­site of her char­ac­ter, the two lead­ing men think they share sim­i­lar­i­ties with their on-screen char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Ong says: “I think Lee Soo and I have a lot in com­mon. When it comes to ex­press­ing our thoughts, the way we think, or com­ing to a de­ci­sion, we con­vey those things with hon­esty.”</p>
    <p>Kim, 28, who falls in love with Shin’s Woo-yeon, says he is largely dif­fer­ent from his char­ac­ter aside from one thing.</p>
    <p>The mem­ber of K-pop boy band ZE:A, which is cur­rently on hia­tus, says: “The one thing we have in com­mon is how we will just charge straight ahead if we were to fall in love.”</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>BEAU­TI­FUL LO­CA­TIONS</p>
    <p>Ro­mance is sweeter when set against a scenic back­drop and Ong says the se­ries de­liv­ers this in spades.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to the most mem­o­rable for him – a kiss­ing scene with Shin – he says: “The sun­set was re­ally pretty, while the vibes given off by the sounds of the wind and sea on Jeju Is­land re­ally helped us im­merse in the mo­ment. We had a great time film­ing in such a beau­ti­ful lo­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>FROM IDOL TO AC­TOR</p>
    <p>Both lead­ing men share a his­tory of be­ing K-pop idols be­fore they dived into act­ing.</p>
    <p>While Ong did not di­rectly ad­dress his idol past in his an­swers, Kim says tran­si­tion­ing from singing to act­ing was no easy feat.</p>
    <p>“When I started act­ing (dur­ing my mu­sic ca­reer), I didn’t have much ex­pe­ri­ence as an ac­tor, so ev­ery mo­ment was a (tall) chal­lenge,” says Kim, who be­gan act­ing around 2011.</p>
    <p>He adds that act­ing and singing have given him op­por­tu­ni­ties to be recog­nised in both fields.“I want to hear peo­ple nat­u­rally talk about how Kim Dong-jun acts and sings well.”</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>THE BUB­BLY ONE</p>
    <p>Shin praised Ong for the con­sid­er­a­tion he showed to the rest of the cast, while he high­lighted her en­er­getic per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>But both ac­tors agree it was Shin who made ev­ery­one on set re­laxed and laugh.</p>
    <p>Kim says: “She’s al­ways the mood maker on set.”</p>
    <p>More Than Friends is avail­able on Viu.</p>
