    <p>Rents for pri­vate apart­ments and Hous­ing Board (HDB) flats con­tin­ued their de­cline amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to flash data re­leased by real es­tate por­tal SRX Prop­erty yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In the pri­vate rental mar­ket, rents last month dipped 0.6 per cent from May. Year on year, pri­vate rents last month fell for the Core Cen­tral Re­gion and Rest of Cen­tral Re­gion by 0.7 per cent and 2.2 per cent re­spec­tively. Over­all, rents for the condo mar­ket were down 18 per cent from their peak in Jan­uary 2013, SRX data showed.</p>
    <p>For the HDB rental mar­ket, rents last month fell by 0.5 per cent from May. Year on year, HDB rents fell by 2 per cent and were 16.1 per cent down from their Au­gust 2013 peak.</p>
    <p>The de­cline in HDB and condo rental rates for four months since Fe­bru­ary il­lus­trates the neg­a­tive ef­fects of the Covid-19 out­break, said ERA Realty head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ni­cholas Mak.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun, OrangeTee & Tie’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy, noted that the de­crease in rents is con­sid­ered mar­ginal.</p>
    <p>“Rents are still rather re­silient in many ar­eas, based on our ground ob­ser­va­tion that there are more peo­ple re­new­ing their con­tracts or rent­ing new apart­ments in re­cent months,” she said. “The drop from 2013 peaks in rent for HDB flats and condo units is the re­sult of an in­crease in sup­ply of such units.”</p>
    <p>The SRX data showed that the num­ber of non-landed pri­vate homes leased rose by 54.4 per cent to 4,473 units last month from 2,897 in May. June’s rental vol­ume for these pri­vate apart­ments is still 13 per cent lower from a year ago, and 4.3 per cent off the five-year av­er­age vol­ume for the month.</p>
    <p>In the HDB rental mar­ket, the num­ber of flats leased rose last month by 55.7 per cent to 1,869 flats, com­pared with 1,200 in May.</p>
    <p>HDB rental vol­umes last month were down by 6.6 per cent from a year ago. They were also 1.2 per cent lower than the five-year av­er­age vol­ume for the month.</p>
    <p>Of the ren­tals last month, 35.3 per cent were for four-room flats, 33.9 per cent for three-room units, 25.4 per cent for five-room units and 5.4 per cent for ex­ec­u­tive flats.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun said: “The in­crease (in rental vol­ume) could be at­trib­uted to more rental re­newals as many ex­pats are not able to travel to another city due to travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“Also, some em­ploy­ers are seek­ing longer-term hous­ing ar­range­ments for their work­ers who were com­mut­ing daily from Malaysia, but are un­able to do so as a re­sult of the bor­der lock­downs.”</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, ob­servers say the rental mar­ket could con­tinue to be damp­ened by the eco­nomic out­look, even as more Sin­ga­pore­ans are rent­ing apart­ments.</p>
    <p>“We have ob­served more Sin­ga­pore­ans, es­pe­cially sin­gles, rent­ing an apart­ment to en­joy greater pri­vacy and au­ton­omy,” said Ms Sun. “It could be more vi­able for them to rent since they may not be el­i­gi­ble to buy an HDB re­sale flat or af­ford a pri­vate condo now.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mak said some leas­ing de­mand could be lost as some for­eign­ers leave Sin­ga­pore, such as those who have lost their jobs. He says leas­ing de­mand this year for pri­vate apart­ments and HDB flats could drop by 2 per cent to 4 per cent.</p>
