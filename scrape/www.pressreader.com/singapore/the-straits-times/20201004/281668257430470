    <p>LONDON • A mass roll-out of a Covid-19 vac­cine in Bri­tain could be fin­ished in as little as three months, The Times re­ported, cit­ing gov­ern­ment sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists work­ing on the Ox­ford vac­cine hope reg­u­la­tors ap­prove it be­fore the be­gin­ning of next year, the Bri­tish news­pa­per said.</p>
    <p>A full Covid-19 im­mu­ni­sa­tion pro­gramme, which would ex­clude chil­dren, could be quicker than ex­perts pre­dicted, The Times said, adding that health of­fi­cials es­ti­mate ev­ery adult could re­ceive a dose of the vac­cine within six months.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Medicines Agency said on Thurs­day that it has started re­view­ing data on As­traZeneca and Ox­ford Univer­sity’s po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine, in real time, the first of such moves aimed at speed­ing up any ap­proval process in the re­gion for a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The news of the Euro­pean re­view also raises chances of the Bri­tish can­di­date – which is seen as lead­ing the race for a suc­cess­ful vac­cine against Covid-19 – be­com­ing the first to be ap­proved in Europe for the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The Times re­port added that plans un­der con­sid­er­a­tion by the gov­ern­ment in­clude al­low­ing a much wider group of health­care staff to ad­min­is­ter the vac­cine, set­ting up drive-through vac­ci­na­tion cen­tres and re­cruit­ing the help of the armed forces.</p>
    <p>The news comes al­most a month after sev­eral global tri­als of the shot were halted ow­ing to an un­ex­plained ill­ness in a study par­tic­i­pant. While most stud­ies have re­sumed, US tri­als are still on pause as reg­u­la­tors widened their probe.</p>
    <p>In the United States, six drug­mak­ers that are re­ceiv­ing gov­ern­ment fund­ing for Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­op­ment have be­gun scal­ing up the man­u­fac­tur­ing of their vac­cine can­di­dates. The com­pa­nies in­clude Pfizer, Moderna, As­traZeneca and John­son & John­son, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said peo­ple in Bri­tain be­came com­pla­cent about so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules in re­cent months, as his own sci­en­tific ad­vis­ers warned it was still highly likely that the coro­n­avirus epi­demic is grow­ing ex­po­nen­tially across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In a BBC in­ter­view, Mr John­son blamed the rise in cases on the “fray</p>
    <p>ing of peo­ple’s dis­ci­pline” over the sum­mer and said the rules were not obeyed or en­forced prop­erly.</p>
    <p>“We came to­gether as a coun­try, we got the num­bers down and I’m afraid some of the mus­cle mem­ory has faded,” he said.</p>
    <p>His com­ments will in­flame the de­bate about the gov­ern­ment’s im­po­si­tion of re­stric­tions to con­trol the pan­demic. Mr John­son’s Fi­nance Min­is­ter Rishi Su­nak sub­sidised meals out in Au­gust to en­cour­age peo­ple to spend money in restau­rants and bars, a pro­gramme some have blamed for the rise in in­fec­tions.</p>
