    <p>Sin­ga­pore com­pa­nies have i mproved markedly over the past two years in dis­clos­ing is­sues sur­round­ing cor­po­rate gov­er­nance, but more needs to be done, a re­port said yesterday.</p>
    <p>It said such dis­clo­sures are even more vi­tal now as com­pa­nies must high­light their cor­po­rate re­sponses to the pan­demic, such as work­from-home pro­ce­dures, im­proved work­place ini­tia­tives, do­na­tions and sup­ply chain mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The re­port stud­ied the 50 largest listed com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore, In­done­sia, Malaysia, the Philip­pines and Thai­land and scored them on their in­ter­nal com­mit­ment to an­ticor­rup­tion, in­clud­ing train­ing pro­grammes and lead­er­ship sup­port.</p>
    <p>They were also as­sessed in ex­ter­nal ar­eas – such as whether they had codes of con­duct for agents and sup­pli­ers, and if they dis­closed po­lit­i­cal con­tri­bu­tions – as well as on re­port­ing and mon­i­tor­ing, such as if they had a whis­tle-blow­ing chan­nel.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore ranked third, be­hind Thai­land, while Malaysia topped the study, which was con­ducted by the Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), or Sias; the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Cen­tre for Gov­er­nance, In­sti­tu­tions and Or­gan­i­sa­tions (CGIO); and the</p>
    <p>Asean CSR Net­work.</p>
    <p>The re­port noted: “The ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore-listed com­pa­nies recog­nised the ne­ces­sity of mak­ing state­ments on their com­mit­ment to an­ticor­rup­tion and law com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>“The aware­ness of up­hold­ing busi­ness integrity stan­dards was en­hanced by reg­u­lar train­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions. A grow­ing num­ber of em­ploy­ers pro­vided com­pul­sory train­ing ses­sions to their new em­ploy­ees on anti-cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>“It is also ob­served that all as­sessed com­pa­nies have put in place a whis­tle-blow­ing chan­nel for in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal stake­hold­ers, most of which pro­hibit re­tal­i­a­tion against the whis­tle-blow­ers act­ing in good faith.”</p>
    <p>It said there has been sig­nif­i­cant progress over the past two years by com­pa­nies dis­clos­ing their com­mit­ment to anti-cor­rup­tion, in­clud­ing im­ple­ment­ing ethics poli­cies for sup­pli­ers and agents, and com­mu­ni­cat­ing these mea­sures to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“About half of the as­sessed listed com­pa­nies stated their pol­icy on gifts, hos­pi­tal­ity and ex­penses, to of­fer guid­ance on giv­ing and re­ceiv­ing gifts when their staff so­cialised with ex­ter­nal par­ties,” the re­port said. But com­pa­nies here must do more. “At pre­sent, the dis­clo­sures on the ethics code ap­plied to agents, the pol­icy on fa­cil­i­ta­tion pay­ment and po­lit­i­cal con­tri­bu­tion are lim­ited.</p>
    <p>“More com­pa­nies should es­tab­lish a reg­u­lar mon­i­tor­ing mech­a­nism of anti-cor­rup­tion pro­grammes. In­stead of mak­ing vague prom­ises in cor­po­rate an­nounce­ments, the cor­po­rates need to get more in­cen­tives to strengthen busi­ness eth­i­cal stan­dards in prac­tice and make them vis­i­ble to the pub­lic,” said the re­port.</p>
    <p>Sias pres­i­dent David Ger­ald told a brief­ing: “Many com­pa­nies see com­pli­ance of cor­po­rate gov­er­nance as a set of rules (for which) one must ‘tick the box’. How­ever, cor­po­rate gov­er­nance is a jour­ney and not a des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“Busi­ness integrity has been an es­sen­tial el­e­ment to en­hance cor­po­rate com­pet­i­tive­ness in the cur­rent busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment, where greater trans­parency and a stronger sense of cor­po­rate re­spon­si­bil­ity are de­manded.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ger­ald urged com­pa­nies to lift their game in this area. “Boil­er­plate re­port­ing must stop and firms have to go be­yond such state­ments. If they want to at­tract in­vestors to their firms, they have to re­port much more than they are do­ing now.”</p>
    <p>CGIO direc­tor Lawrence Loh said: “(They) seem to have this in­er­tia to dis­close any­thing re­lat­ing to busi­ness integrity... When in doubt, they should al­ways dis­close.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore ranks highly in terms of na­tional rep­u­ta­tion for anti-cor­rup­tion, but when it comes to cor­po­ra­tions, ev­ery­thing seems to be miss­ing.”</p>
