    <p>High school se­nior Pimyada Panya­puwased uses Face­book and In­sta­gram to talk to her peers, Twit­ter to ex­press her thoughts, and the Line mes­sag­ing app to com­mu­ni­cate with her par­ents.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia, says the 17-year-old girl, is her soap­box be­cause main­stream me­dia con­tent is dom­i­nated by the state or older folk. So she was dis­mayed when the Thai govern­ment re­cently made po­lice re­ports against Twit­ter and Face­book af­ter the com­pa­nies failed to re­strict on­line con­tent it deemed il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>“It is not right,” she fumed. “They limit our speech for their own con­ve­nience.”</p>
    <p>De­bate over curbs on on­line con­tent boiled over af­ter the Min­istry of Dig­i­tal Econ­omy and So­ci­ety filed com­plaints last month with the cy­ber­crime po­lice against the two so­cial me­dia firms for fail­ing to re­move 500 posts as or­dered by the court.</p>
    <p>This comes amid grow­ing so­cial me­dia chat­ter about the role of Thai­land’s monar­chy, with anti-govern­ment pro­test­ers openly ques­tion­ing the ex­pen­di­ture of and power wielded by King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
    <p>For years, a law crim­i­nal­is­ing in­sult of the monar­chy helped keep a lid on crit­i­cism of the palace, but young Thais – em­bold­ened by the anonymity pro­vided by so­cial me­dia – are no longer so re­strained.</p>
    <p>Thai­land is es­ca­lat­ing le­gal ac­tion against the global so­cial me­dia gi­ants as its re­gional peers sim­i­larly turn up the heat on them.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam re­port­edly took Face­book’s lo­cal servers off­line this year un­til the com­pany agreed to in­crease cen­sor­ship of “anti-state” posts by its Viet­namese users.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a Reuters re­port in April, the re­stric­tions were car­ried out by state-owned telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pa­nies, which knocked Face­book’s lo­cal servers off­line for about seven weeks.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore last year en­acted the Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act, which can com­pel an In­ter­net in­ter­me­di­ary to send a cor­rec­tion no­tice to its Sin­ga­pore users or block ac­cess to the of­fend­ing ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>The Asia In­ter­net Coali­tion, a tech­nol­ogy in­dus­try group that Face­book and Twit­ter be­long to, de­clined com­ment on the ac­tion taken by re­gional gov­ern­ments against so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The tus­sle over who gets the last word on so­cial me­dia is be­com­ing contentiou­s as peo­ple in­creas­ingly con­sume news via these plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to so­cial me­dia agen­cies We Are So­cial and Hoot­suite, ac­tive so­cial me­dia users in July made up 77 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore, 73 per cent in Thai­land, and 67 per cent in Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter last Thurs­day re­vealed it had blocked 926 ac­counts it had linked to the Thai army that were am­pli­fy­ing pro-mil­i­tary po­si­tions as well as tar­get­ing the po­lit­i­cal op­po­si­tion. The army de­nied as­so­ci­a­tion with these ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Face­book, un­der pres­sure in places like In­dia and Myan­mar for be­ing too lax on hate speech, raised eye­brows in Au­gust when it de­clared it was pre­par­ing a le­gal chal­lenge to the Thai govern­ment’s or­der that it block the Roy­al­ist Mar­ket­place, a group which al­legedly posted defam­a­tory con­tent on the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>While re­gional gov­ern­ments say they in­creas­ingly need to com­bat dis­in­for­ma­tion and mis­in­for­ma­tion, hu­man rights groups al­lege that this is a cover to sti­fle dis­sent.</p>
    <p>“Do­mes­tic cy­ber­laws, their tech­ni­cal re­quire­ments and even in­sti­tu­tional bar­ri­ers that are put in place for other pur­poses such as pre­vent­ing cy­ber­crimes, pro­tect­ing against cy­ber at­tacks or reg­u­lat­ing elec­tronic trans­ac­tions are in­stead weaponised by South-east Asian gov­ern­ments to con­trol con­tent shared (and shape) their own nar­ra­tives,” said Ms Em­i­lie Pradi­chit, founder of the</p>
    <p>Bangkok-based Manushya Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­der Thai­land’s cy­ber­crime law, so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies can be fined 200,000 baht (S$8,700) for ig­nor­ing a take-down or­der, as well as an ex­tra 5,000 baht for ev­ery day the of­fend­ing con­tent stays up.</p>
    <p>But le­gal ex­perts doubt the do­mes­tic law can be en­forced, be­cause Dig­i­tal Min­is­ter Put­tipong Pun­nakan had said the com­plaints were filed against the United States-based par­ent com­pa­nies rather than their Thai sub­sidiaries.</p>
    <p>“The key point is to sig­nal to the pub­lic that you don’t cross this line and try to per­suade so­cial me­dia plat­forms to self-cen­sor,” said As­so­ci­ate Professor Kanathip Thon­grawee­wong, who heads the In­sti­tute of Dig­i­tal Me­dia Law at Kasem Bun­dit Univer­sity in Bangkok.</p>
    <p>On a broader scale, plac­ing re­stric­tions to con­trol data within phys­i­cal bor­ders will af­fect the util­ity of the In­ter­net and how well com­pa­nies are able to pro­vide their ser­vices, warned Mr Rajnesh Singh, Asia-Pa­cific re­gional vice-pres­i­dent of the In­ter­net So­ci­ety, a non-profit group work­ing to keep the In­ter­net open.</p>
    <p>Making on­line in­ter­me­di­aries li­able for user-gen­er­ated con­tent could also af­fect how much a com­pany is will­ing to in­vest in cre­at­ing or ex­pand­ing its ser­vices be­cause of the risks in­volved, he said.</p>
    <p>“What we see right now is re­sis­tance by the tech com­pa­nies, and in cases where there is some will­ing­ness, there is an at­tempt to set the rules of the game. Gov­ern­ments then tend to take a stricter stance and start con­sid­er­ing – or im­ple­ment­ing – leg­isla­tive mea­sures,” he told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther of these ap­proaches is work­able or sus­tain­able, Mr Singh em­pha­sised.</p>
    <p>More likely than not, he added, “these will end up cre­at­ing bar­ri­ers to en­try for new play­ers and at the same time fur­ther strengthen the dom­i­nant po­si­tion of the larger play­ers”.</p>
