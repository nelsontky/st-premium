    <p>LON­DON • “It’s the hope that kills you,” goes one of foot­ball’s old­est cliches. New­cas­tle fans know that bet­ter than most, with the Premier League club mired in medi­ocrity since Mike Ash­ley’s takeover in 2007.</p>
    <p>Fans have long been dis­il­lu­sioned by the founder of Bri­tish re­tail goods chain Sports Di­rect’s re­luc­tance to loosen the purse strings at St James’ Park, con­trary to his early prom­ises to bring the glory days back to Ty­ne­side.</p>
    <p>With never-end­ing protests against his hands-off lead­er­ship at a club that boasts one of the largest fan bases in the UK – New­cas­tle reg­u­larly sell out their 52,000-ca­pac­ity sta­dium – Ash­ley of­fi­cially put the club up for sale back in Oc­to­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>Since then, there has been plenty of pa­per talk about a po­ten­tial takeover, but only the Saudi Ara­bi­abacked con­sor­tium has amounted to any­thing con­crete.</p>
    <p>The same month Ash­ley put the Mag­pies up for sale, talk emerged that a Chi­nese con­sor­tium were keen, but no of­fer was made.</p>
    <p>A month later, Bri­tish fi­nancier Amanda Stave­ley first at­tempted to buy New­cas­tle, but walked away in Jan­uary af­ter talks hit a snag, with Ash­ley play­ing hard­ball.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber 2018, it was re­ported for­mer Manch­ester United chief ex­ec­u­tive Peter Kenyon was in­ter­ested in buy­ing the club, but was told to re­turn with funds, which he never did.</p>
    <p>In May last year, Bri­tish tabloid The Sun said Ash­ley had agreed to sell to Abu Dhabi bil­lion­aire Sheikh Khaled Zayed Al Ne­hayan, but the £350 mil­lion (S$630 mil­lion) deal never ma­te­ri­alised.</p>
    <p>Stave­ley came back in March, this time with the Public In­vest­ment Fund, Saudi Ara­bia’s sov­er­eign wealth fund, and Bri­tish prop­erty bil­lion­aire broth­ers, David and Si­mon Reuben, on board. The group an­nounced a pro­posed takeover for £300 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The bid, which was ac­cepted, had a guar­an­tee of £250 mil­lion to be spent on the team over the next five years, with mil­lions more to be in­vested in the lo­cal com­mu­nity – a prospect that left New­cas­tle fans ex­cited.</p>
    <p>But last month, the of­fer col­lapsed af­ter the con­sor­tium de­clined to take up the Premier League’s of­fer of in­de­pen­dent ar­bi­tra­tion to de­cide the club’s owner. Stave­ley slammed the de­ci­sion as “ridicu­lous” as “no coun­try has be­come a di­rec­tor of a club”.</p>
    <p>Since then, two par­ties have emerged as pos­si­ble buy­ers.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can bil­lion­aire Henry Mau­riss, who is the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Clear TV, which op­er­ates one of the largest TV net­works for air­ports across the US, is said to have lodged a £350 mil­lion bid.</p>
    <p>On Aug 15, Bel­la­graph Nova group, which is co-founded by Sin­ga­pore en­trepreneur­s Ter­ence Loh and Nel­son Loh as well as Chi­nese na­tional Evan­ge­line Shen, an­nounced it was at “an ad­vanced stage of ne­go­ti­a­tion” for a £280 mil­lion takeover.</p>
    <p>Ash­ley is un­der­stood to be not tak­ing these of­fers se­ri­ously, with lo­cal daily The Shields Gazette yes­ter­day say­ing the 55-year-old “only has eyes for a res­ur­rec­tion of the Saud­i­fi­nanced £300 mil­lion deal”.</p>
    <p>Ty­ne­side news­pa­per The Chron­i­cle also re­ported there has been “no ad­vance” on Bel­la­graph’s of­fer, with Ash­ley’s lawyers, Den­tons, opt­ing to blank the group.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish tabloid The Daily Star claimed on Sun­day that the owner would soon be is­su­ing an of­fi­cial state­ment, brand­ing the two wouldbe-buy­ers as “time-wasters”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Shields has re­ported he will “keep his coun­sel” for now.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a meet­ing with the New­cas­tle United Sup­port­ers Trust last week, the Premier League’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, Richard Mas­ters, said the Saudi-backed bid could be re­vived if the “con­sor­tium pro­vides more in­for­ma­tion, which would be used to con­sider any po­ten­tial dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion of those in­volved”.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen if a com­pro­mise can be bro­kered, but what looks cer­tain is that New­cas­tle will go into the new sea­son start­ing on Sept 12 with Ash­ley still re­main­ing at the helm.</p>
