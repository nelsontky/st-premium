    <p>MADRID • Po­lice set up con­trols and stopped cars on ma­jor roads into and out of Madrid yes­ter­day as the city went back into lock­down due to surg­ing coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>About 4.8 mil­lion peo­ple are barred from l eav­ing the cap­i­tal area, while restau­rants and bars must shut early and re­duce ca­pac­ity by half.</p>
    <p>The new re­stric­tions, which started on Fri­day evening and will ini­tially last for 14 days, are not as strict as the pre­vi­ous lock­down in March, when peo­ple were barred from leav­ing their homes.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the au­thor­i­ties ad­vised res­i­dents not to move around un­less ab­so­lutely nec­es­sary. Travel is banned ex­cept for work, school, med­i­cal ap­point­ments or shop­ping.</p>
    <p>“There are fewer peo­ple than we’re used to, shops are empty, bars are empty, there’s a feel­ing of sad­ness,” said Pro­fes­sor Va­le­rio Rocco Lozano, di­rec­tor of the Cir­culo de Bel­las Artes cul­tural or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“We had reser­va­tions, but a lot of peo­ple have called to can­cel them,” said Ms Macarena Molina, who works in a hos­tel in cen­tral Madrid.</p>
    <p>“To­day, we had a reser­va­tion... and they can­celled just an hour be­fore, say­ing they were not go­ing to travel be­cause of the re­stric­tions.”</p>
    <p>The lat­est mea­sures or­dered by the So­cial­ist-led cen­tral gov­ern­ment were re­luc­tantly im­posed by the con­ser­va­tive-led Madrid gov­ern­ment, which said they would crip­ple the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Madrid’s bars and restau­rants must close at 11pm in­stead of 1am, while restau­rants, gyms and shops must cut ca­pac­ity by half. Gath­er­ings of more than six peo­ple re­main banned.</p>
    <p>Near the Plaza Mayor square, usu­ally packed with tourists on a Satur­day dur­ing lunchtime, waiter Luis stood, menu in hand, try­ing to drum up busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“No one is walk­ing past here,” he said. “I don’t know how much longer we are go­ing to keep our jobs.”</p>
    <p>With 850 cases for ev­ery 100,000 peo­ple, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, the Madrid area has Europe’s worst rate.</p>
    <p>Spain had 789,932 coro­n­avirus cases as at Fri­day, up by 11,325 since last Thurs­day, and there have been 32,086 fatal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Daily deaths are around their high­est lev­els since early May, although far be­low the late March record of nearly 900.</p>
    <p>The new re­stric­tions will de­stroy 18,000 jobs and €750 mil­lion (S$1.19 bil­lion) in rev­enue each week, Madrid’s re­gional gov­ern­ment said in a law­suit filed on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The re­gional gov­ern­ment ar­gued the new curbs were im­posed with­out the re­quired unan­i­mous con­sen­sus of Spain’s 17 re­gions that are pri­mar­ily in charge of health ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez said Madrid was fac­ing “a moment of ex­tra­or­di­nary grav­ity” and de­fended the move as nec­es­sary to limit the cir­cu­la­tion of the virus in a re­gion that counted 36 per cent of Spain’s in­fec­tions in the past fort­night.</p>
    <p>For now, the court chal­lenge will not im­pede im­ple­men­ta­tion of the re­stric­tions.</p>
