    <p>NEW YORK • The World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) yes­ter­day un­der­cut the main jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s trade war against China, say­ing that Amer­i­can tar­iffs on Chi­nese goods vi­o­late in­ter­na­tional rules.</p>
    <p>A panel of three WTO trade ex­perts said the US broke in­ter­na­tional rules when it im­posed tar­iffs on Chi­nese goods in 2018. Wash­ing­ton has im­posed levies on more than US$550 bil­lion (S$749 bil­lion) in Chi­nese ex­ports. The panel said in its re­port “that the United States had not met its bur­den of demon­strat­ing that the mea­sures are pro­vi­sion­ally jus­ti­fied”.</p>
    <p>While the rul­ing bol­sters Bei­jing’s claims, Wash­ing­ton can ef­fec­tively veto the de­ci­sion by lodg­ing an ap­peal at any point in the next 60 days.</p>
    <p>That is be­cause the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has al­ready paral­ysed the WTO’s ap­pel­late body, a tac­tic that has ren­dered tooth­less the world’s fore­most ar­biter of trade.</p>
    <p>The dis­pute cen­tres on the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s use of a 1970s-era US trade law to uni­lat­er­ally launch its com­mer­cial con­flict against China in 2018.</p>
    <p>China claimed the tar­iffs vi­o­lated the WTO’s most-favoured treat­ment pro­vi­sion be­cause the mea­sures failed to pro­vide the same treat­ment to all WTO mem­bers.</p>
    <p>China also al­leged the du­ties broke a key dis­pute set­tle­ment rule that re­quires coun­tries to first seek re­course from the WTO be­fore im­pos­ing re­tal­ia­tory mea­sures against an­other coun­try.</p>
    <p>The US tar­iffs against China were au­tho­rised un­der Sec­tion 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which em­pow­ers the pres­i­dent to levy tar­iffs and other im­port re­stric­tions when­ever a for­eign coun­try im­poses un­fair trade prac­tices that af­fect US com­merce. The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has claimed the tar­iffs were nec­es­sary to con­front China’s wide­spread vi­o­la­tions of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights and forced tech­nol­ogy trans­fer poli­cies.</p>
    <p>China’s Min­istry of Com­merce said in a state­ment that it “ap­pre­ci­ates the ob­jec­tive and fair rul­ing made by the ex­pert group”.</p>
    <p>“China also hopes that the United States will fully re­spect the rul­ings of the ex­pert group and the rules­based mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem, and take prac­ti­cal ac­tions to meet China and other WTO mem­bers to jointly main­tain the mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem and pro­mote the sta­ble and healthy de­vel­op­ment of the world econ­omy,” it added.</p>
