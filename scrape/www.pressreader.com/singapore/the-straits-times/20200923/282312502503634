    <p>•</p>
    <p>Cy­cling has been thrown into fresh tur­moil af­ter French ju­di­cial au­thor­i­ties opened a pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tion into po­ten­tial dop­ing at French team Arkea-Sam­sic on Mon­day, a day af­ter the Tour de France ended in Paris.</p>
    <p>Two peo­ple had been taken into cus­tody, Mar­seille pros­e­cu­tor Do­minique Lau­rens said in a state­ment, adding that the probe was tar­get­ing a “small part of the team” and that those in cus­tody were part of the “close en­tourage of the main rider”, with­out nam­ing him.</p>
    <p>Arkea-Sam­sic’s l eader on the Tour was Colom­bian Nairo Quin­tana, a two-time run­ner-up, and Vuelta and Giro d’Italia cham­pion. He fin­ished 17th over­all on this year’s Tour.</p>
    <p>The team con­firmed their ho­tel in Meri­bel was searched by French au­thor­i­ties af­ter last Wednes­day’s 17th stage.</p>
    <p>The probe tar­geted “the ad­min­is­tra­tion and pre­scrip­tion with­out med­i­cal jus­ti­fi­ca­tion of a sub­stance or a method pro­hib­ited dur­ing a sport­ing event, and help­ing and en­cour­ag­ing the use of that sub­stance or method”, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Lau­rens said the search had re­sulted in the “dis­cov­ery of many</p>
    <p>We ob­vi­ously sup­port our rid­ers, but if the in­ves­ti­ga­tion con­firms the ve­rac­ity of dop­ing prac­tices, the team would im­me­di­ately dis­so­ci­ate it­self from such acts, and will not hes­i­tate to cut ties with them.</p>
    <p>health prod­ucts, in­clud­ing drugs and espe­cially a method that can be qual­i­fied as dop­ing”.</p>
    <p>A source with di­rect knowl­edge of the mat­ter said a “saline so­lu­tion” and “in­jec­tion ma­te­rial” had been found.</p>
    <p>In­jec­tion ma­te­rial can only be in pos­ses­sion of doc­tors as per the ‘no nee­dle pol­icy’ in place in cy­cling since 2011.</p>
    <p>Arkea-Sam­sic team man­ager Em­manuel Hubert said on Mon­day that the in­ves­ti­ga­tion did “not tar­get the team or its staff di­rectly”.</p>
    <p>“We ob­vi­ously sup­port our rid­ers,</p>
    <p>but if the in­ves­ti­ga­tion con­firms the ve­rac­ity of dop­ing prac­tices, the team would im­me­di­ately dis­so­ci­ate it­self from such acts,” he added.</p>
    <p>Quin­tana’s man­age­ment has not re­sponded to a Reuters re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>This year’s Tour was won by Slove­nian Tadej Po­gacar, who pro­duced one of the most stun­ning per­for­mances in re­cent his­tory in the fi­nal time trial last Satur­day to over­turn a 57-sec­ond deficit to com­pa­triot Pri­moz Roglic.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old is with Team UAE Emi­rates, which is man­aged</p>
    <p>by Mauro Gianetti and Matxin Fernandez, sports di­rec­tors at Sau­nier Du­val in 2008 when the team left the Tour in the wake of Ri­cardo Ricco’s failed dop­ing test.</p>
    <p>The duo were also manag­ing the Geox-TMC team when Spa­niard Juan Jose Cobo won the Vuelta in 2011, only to be stripped of the ti­tle be­cause of a “vi­o­la­tion of the an­ti­dop­ing rules (use of a banned sub­stance) based on ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties found in his Ath­lete Bi­o­log­i­cal Pass­port in 2009 and 2011”.</p>
    <p>“I am too young to re­mem­ber that era,” said Po­gacar when asked</p>
    <p>about the en­tourage in his team.</p>
    <p>“I was 10 in 2008 and it’s weird to be talk­ing about this be­cause it goes against ev­ery­thing I be­lieve in.”</p>
    <p>The last no­table rider to fail a dop­ing test on the Tour was Lux­em­bourg’s Frank Sch­leck in 2012.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Cy­cling Union (UCI) told Reuters that it “wel­comes and sup­ports the ac­tion of all au­thor­i­ties in­volved in this oper­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>It said it will take “nec­es­sary mea­sures once it has re­viewed the el­e­ments ob­tained by the French ju­di­cial au­thor­i­ties”.</p>
