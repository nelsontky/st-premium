    <p>The Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nom­ics (Home), an or­gan­i­sa­tion that ad­vo­cates the rights of mi­grant work­ers, has come up with a se­ries of rec­om­men­da­tions in re­sponse to a par­lia­men­tary de­bate last week on a case in­volv­ing Ms Parti Liyani, the for­mer maid of Changi Air­port Group past chair­man Liew Mun Leong.</p>
    <p>Among other things, it wants greater ac­count­abil­ity in the con­duct of in­ves­ti­ga­tion in­ter­views through the ex­panded use of video record­ings, and greater ac­cess to pro­fes­sional in­ter­preters and lawyers for mi­grant work­ers ac­cused of crimes. Home also said in its state­ment yes­ter­day that it “wel­comes the re­cent par­lia­men­tary de­bate of fair­ness and equity in Sin­ga­pore’s crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem”.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam de­liv­ered a min­is­te­rial state­ment on Ms Parti’s case in Par­lia­ment, in which he said in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions by the po­lice and the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers show there was no un­due in­flu­ence on them by Mr Liew or any­one act­ing on the fam­ily’s be­half. But the min­is­ter ac­knowl­edged that there were lapses in the in­ves­ti­ga­tion process.</p>
    <p>Home said de­spite the Gov­ern­ment’s as­sur­ances, the no­tion that there are deep-rooted “sys­temic is­sues faced by dis­ad­van­taged ac­cused, es­pe­cially mi­grant work­ers” has been re­in­forced. It rec­om­mended that video record­ing in in­ves­ti­ga­tion in­ter­views be ex­panded to more cases than the cur­rent prac­tice of us­ing them only for se­ri­ous sex crimes. It also wants the record­ings to be read­ily avail­able to the ac­cused.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, the in­ter­views should be done when the ac­cused is alert and can pro­vide re­li­able in­for­ma­tion, rather than in the early hours, Home said. It also called for com­plaints against po­lice of­fi­cers to be as­sessed through an “in­de­pen­dent mech­a­nism” to boost public con­fi­dence in the po­lice’s ac­count­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Home noted the prac­tice now is for such com­plaints to go to the In­ter­nal Af­fairs Of­fice of the po­lice.</p>
    <p>An­other rec­om­men­da­tion is im­proved ac­cess to pro­fes­sional in­ter­preters for mi­grant work­ers whose first lan­guage is not English.</p>
    <p>It said it some­times re­ceives com­plaints from th­ese work­ers that their in­ter­preters gave them un­so­licited ad­vice. Also, there are cases where they in­ter­viewed with­out any in­ter­preter, Home added.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers help­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions should be al­lowed to seek em­ploy­ment, it said, not­ing that maids ac­cused of of­fences are gen­er­ally pro­hib­ited from do­ing so.</p>
    <p>Home also called for the Crim­i­nal Le­gal Aid Scheme to be ex­panded, not­ing that many low-wage mi­grant work­ers have ben­e­fited from its ser­vices. It also hopes the pro­posed Public De­fender’s Of­fice will be open to mi­grant work­ers.</p>
