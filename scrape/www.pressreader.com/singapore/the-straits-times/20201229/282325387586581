    <p>Eques­trian is not the only sport to use tech­nol­ogy to or­gan­ise com­pe­ti­tions dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The April 17-June 5 Pro­fes­sional Darts Cor­po­ra­tion (PDC) Home Tour was or­gan­ised for play­ers who had a PDC Tour card this year, with English­man Nathan Aspinall emerg­ing as cham­pion.</p>
    <p>It was not all pitch per­fect, how­ever, as Kee­gan Brown was elim­i­nated in the group stage after ex­pe­ri­enc­ing In­ter­net is­sues.</p>
    <p>When the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) sea­son was sus­pended in April, eight NBA and Women’s Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion play­ers and le­gends par­tic­i­pated in the April 12-16 NBA Horse Chal­lenge, where they had to match one an­other’s shots in a knock-out com­pe­ti­tion streamed on the ESPN app.</p>
    <p>Utah Jazz guard Mike Con­ley Jr, play­ing from an in­door gym in Colum­bus, Ohio beat Chicago Bulls guard Zach LaVine to win the con­test.</p>
    <p>The theme of com­pet­ing at home con­tin­ued in the “Ul­ti­mate Gar­den Clash”, with Mondo Du­plan­tis and Re­naud Lav­il­le­nie shar­ing gold on May 3 after a pole vault com­pe­ti­tion held at their re­spec­tive homes in Louisiana and Cler­mont-Fer­rand, France. The event was screened by World Ath­let­ics on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>A more am­bi­tious ath­let­ics meet, the In­spi­ra­tion Games, was held on July 9 when world-class tal­ent com­peted across seven venues around the globe in eight events, each fea­tur­ing three ath­letes.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Noah Lyles thought he ran the 200m race in 18.90sec, faster than Usain Bolt’s world record (19.19sec), un­til it was dis­cov­ered he started from the wrong line and ran only 185 me­tres.</p>
