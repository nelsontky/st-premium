    <p>To put it in blunt terms, for many peo­ple, (Mr Don­ald Trump) is the only mid­dle fin­ger avail­able – to bran­dish against the peo­ple who’ve as­sumed they have the whip hand in Amer­i­can cul­ture.</p>
    <p>We still do not know who is the win­ner of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. But we do know who is the loser: the United States of Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>We have just ex­pe­ri­enced four years of the most di­vi­sive and dis­hon­est pres­i­dency in Amer­i­can his­tory, which at­tacked the twin pil­lars of our democ­racy – truth and trust.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump did not spend a sin­gle day of his term try­ing to be pres­i­dent of all the peo­ple, and he broke rules and trashed norms in ways that no pres­i­dent ever dared – right up to Wed­nes­day night when he falsely claimed elec­tion fraud and sum­moned the Supreme Court to step in and stop the vot­ing, as if such a thing were even re­motely pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“Frankly, we did win this elec­tion,” Mr Trump de­clared, while mil­lions of bal­lots re­mained to be counted in Wis­con­sin, Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia, Ge­or­gia, Ari­zona and Ne­vada.</p>
    <p>“We’ll be go­ing to the US Supreme Court,” he added, with­out ex­plain­ing how or on what ba­sis. “We want all vot­ing to stop.”</p>
    <p>We want all vot­ing to stop? You can’t do that.</p>
    <p>But if Mr Joe Bi­den wins, it may be by just a sliver of votes in sev­eral key bat­tle­ground states. Al­though he’ll likely win the pop­u­lar vote, there will be no land­slide – no over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity telling Mr Trump and those around him that enough was enough: Be gone with you and never bring that kind of pol­i­tics of di­vi­sion back to this coun­try again.</p>
    <p>“What­ever the fi­nal vote, it is al­ready clear that the num­ber of Amer­i­cans say­ing, ‘Enough is enough’ was not enough,” said lead­er­ship ex­pert Dov Sei­d­man, author of the book How: Why How We Do Any­thing Means Ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>NO MORAL WAVE</p>
    <p>“There was no blue po­lit­i­cal wave,” he added. “But, more im­por­tantly, there was no moral wave. There was no wide­spread re­jec­tion of the kind of lead­er­ship that di­vides us, es­pe­cially in a pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>We are a coun­try with mul­ti­ple com­pound frac­tures, and so we sim­ply can­not do any­thing am­bi­tious any more – like put a man on the moon – be­cause am­bi­tious things have to be done to­gether.</p>
    <p>We couldn’t even come to­gether to all wear masks in a pan­demic, when health ex­perts tell us it would ab­so­lutely save lives. It would be so sim­ple, so easy and so pa­tri­otic to say, “I pro­tect you and you pro­tect me.” And yet, we can’t do it.</p>
    <p>This elec­tion, if any­thing, high­lighted the fault lines. The Pres­i­dent, us­ing many dif­fer­ent dog whis­tles dur­ing the cam­paign, pre­sented him­self as the leader of Amer­ica’s shrink­ing white ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>It is im­pos­si­ble to ex­plain his con­tin­ued sup­port, de­spite his un­prece­dented poi­sonous be­hav­iour in of­fice, with­out ref­er­ence to two num­bers: The US Cen­sus Bureau projects that by the mid­dle of this year, non-whites will con­sti­tute a ma­jor­ity of the na­tion’s 74 mil­lion chil­dren. At the same time, it is es­ti­mated that by some time in the 2040s, whites will make up 49 per cent of the US pop­u­la­tion, and Lati­nos, blacks, Asians and mul­tira­cial pop­u­la­tions 51 per cent.</p>
    <p>There is clearly a dis­com­fort, and even re­sis­tance, among many whites, par­tic­u­larly white work­ing-class males with­out col­lege de­grees, to the fact that Amer­ica is in a steady process of be­com­ing “mi­nor­ity white”. They see Mr Trump as a bul­wark against the so­cial, cul­tural and eco­nomic im­pli­ca­tions of that.</p>
    <p>What many Democrats see as a good trend – a coun­try reck­on­ing with struc­tural racism and learn­ing to em­brace and cel­e­brate in­creas­ing di­ver­sity – many white peo­ple see as a fun­da­men­tal cul­tural threat. And that is fu­elling an­other lethal trend this elec­tion only re­in­forced.</p>
    <p>“Many Repub­li­can sen­a­tors and con­gres­sional rep­re­sen­ta­tives – like Lind­sey Gra­ham in South Carolina and John Cornyn in Texas – won by hug­ging Trump,” said Dr Gautam Mukunda, author of In­dis­pens­able: When Lead­ers Re­ally Mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“That means that Trump­ism is the fu­ture of the GOP. The tac­ti­cally unique thing about Trump­ism is that it never even tries to get the sup­port of the ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans. So the GOP will con­tinue with the strat­egy of us­ing ev­ery le­gal, but demo­crat­i­cally deeply harm­ful, way to con­trol power even though most Amer­i­cans vote against them – like the way they just crammed through two Supreme Court jus­tices.”</p>
    <p>That means all the stresses on the Amer­i­can sys­tem of gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to grow, Dr Mukunda added, be­cause in Amer­ica’s an­ti­quated elec­toral sys­tem, Repub­li­cans the­o­ret­i­cally can con­trol both the White House and Se­nate – de­spite the de­sires of a large ma­jor­ity of the Amer­i­can peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“No sys­tem can sur­vive that kind of stress,” he con­cluded. “It will break at some point.”</p>
    <p>Noth­ing has hap­pened, even if Mr Bi­den wins, that sug­gests that Repub­li­cans will fun­da­men­tally re­think this po­lit­i­cal strat­egy that they per­fected un­der Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>BACK­LASH AGAINST LIB­ERAL ELITES</p>
    <p>But Democrats have a lot to re­think as well, noted Dr Michael San­del, a pro­fes­sor at Har­vard and author of The Tyranny Of Merit: What’s Be­come Of The Com­mon Good.</p>
    <p>“Even though Joe Bi­den em­pha­sised his work­ing-class roots and sym­pa­thies,” Dr San­del told me, “the Demo­cratic Party con­tin­ues to be more iden­ti­fied with pro­fes­sional elites and col­lege-ed­u­cated vot­ers than with the blue-col­lar vot­ers who once con­sti­tuted its base.</p>
    <p>“Even so epochal an event as a pan­demic, bun­gled by Trump, did not change this. Democrats need to ask them­selves: Why do many work­ing peo­ple em­brace a plu­to­crat-pop­ulist whose poli­cies do lit­tle to help them? Democrats need to ad­dress the sense of hu­mil­i­a­tion felt by work­ing peo­ple who feel the econ­omy has left them be­hind and that cre­den­tialed elites look down on them.”</p>
    <p>Again, while Mr Bi­den made small in­roads with work­ing-class vot­ers, there seems to be no huge shift. Maybe be­cause many work­ing-class Trump vot­ers not only feel looked down upon, but they also re­sent what they see as cul­tural cen­sor­ship from lib­eral elites, com­ing out of col­lege cam­puses.</p>
    <p>As edi­tor of Na­tional Re­view</p>
    <p>Rich Lowry wrote in an Oct 26 es­say, “Trump is, for bet­ter or worse, the fore­most sym­bol of re­sis­tance to the over­whelm­ing woke cul­tural tide that has swept along the me­dia, academia, cor­po­rate Amer­ica, Hol­ly­wood, pro­fes­sional sports, the big foun­da­tions, and al­most ev­ery­thing in be­tween.”</p>
    <p>“To put it in blunt terms,” he con­tin­ued, “for many peo­ple, he’s the only mid­dle fin­ger avail­able – to bran­dish against the peo­ple who’ve as­sumed they have the whip hand in Amer­i­can cul­ture. This may not be a very good rea­son to vote for a pres­i­dent, and it doesn’t ex­cuse Trump’s abysmal con­duct and mal­ad­min­is­tra­tion.”</p>
    <p>This elec­tion shows that view seems to be still very alive among Trump vot­ers.</p>
    <p>I con­fess that the hard­est con­ver­sa­tions I had on Wed­nes­day night were with my daugh­ters. I so badly want to tell them that all is go­ing to be OK, that we’ve been through bad patches as a coun­try be­fore. And I hope that will turn out to be the case – that who­ever wins this elec­tion will draw the right con­clu­sion that we sim­ply can­not go on tear­ing one an­other apart this way.</p>
    <p>But I could not, in all hon­esty, tell them that with any con­fi­dence. I am cer­tain “the bet­ter an­gels of our na­ture” are still out there, but our pol­i­tics and our po­lit­i­cal sys­tem right now are not in­spir­ing them to emerge at the scale and speed that we so des­per­ately need.</p>
