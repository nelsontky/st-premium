    <p>It is not as clear as day who will be bet­ter for South-east Asia: Mr Don­ald Trump or Mr Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“There are up­sides and down­sides,” said re­search fel­low Lu­cio Pitlo III at the Asia-Pa­cific Path­ways to Progress Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump is re-elected, he will likely con­tinue his trans­ac­tional, go-it-alone way of deal­ing with both al­lies and ad­ver­saries, with ran­cour and un­pre­dictabil­ity.</p>
    <p>Dr Dinna Prapto Raharja, an In­done­sian ex­pert on in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions, said: “Ev­ery­one, in­clud­ing In­done­sia, must an­tic­i­pate his er­ratic ac­tions, his un­planned ac­tions that are based on his wishes to win at all costs.”</p>
    <p>This is not en­tirely a bad thing for the re­gion, es­pe­cially for na­tions with enough lever­age to wran­gle good terms, like Viet­nam, which can pro­vide sanc­tu­ary for US firms flee­ing China and be a coun­ter­bal­ance to Bei­jing’s am­bi­tions as the su­per­power in Asia.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is also not keen on in­ter­fer­ing in the do­mes­tic af­fairs of other na­tions, which will be com­fort­ing for strong­men such as Thai Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chano-cha and Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte.</p>
    <p>“Trump will be bet­ter for the cur­rent (Thai) regime due to his prag­ma­tism and ig­no­rance of do­mes­tic is­sues any­where in the world,” said Dr Pong­phisoot Bus­barat, a lec­turer on in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions at Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is ex­pected to bring to the ta­ble what the re­gion sorely needs: a re­turn to mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism.</p>
    <p>That may, among other things, mean the US will re­join the Tran­sPa­cific Part­ner­ship pact, which will be a boon for Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, Brunei and Viet­nam, as the world tries to re­cover from Covid-19’s fi­nan­cial im­pact.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den is also likely to fo</p>
    <p>cus on hu­man rights, and cre­ate a tail­wind for pro-democ­racy move­ments in the re­gion. That will ruf­fle feath­ers in Thai­land, the Philip­pines, Viet­nam and Myan­mar, where gov­er­nance and civil lib­er­ties form a com­pli­cated mix.</p>
    <p>As for re­gional se­cu­rity, both men will not sig­nif­i­cantly al­ter the dy­nam­ics, which are dic­tated in large part by the ri­valry be­tween the US and China to be the dom­i­nant force in the re­gion. Asean will have to con­tinue nav­i­gat­ing a thin mid­dle ground and en­hance its de­fence ties with the US with­out invit­ing reprisals from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>As for deal­ing with the pan­demic, Mr Pitlo said: “The com­mit­ment to mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and sup­port for a pan­demic re­sponse and eco­nomic re­cov­ery, ver­sus an im­pres­sion that Amer­ica dis­dains mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism – I think Bi­den ex­udes a bet­ter aura in terms of get­ting coun­tries on board (a global pan­demic re­sponse).”</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one, in­clud­ing In­done­sia, must an­tic­i­pate his er­ratic ac­tions, his un­planned ac­tions that are based on his wishes to win at all costs.</p>
