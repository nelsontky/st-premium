    <p>A Bangladesh­i worker was sen­tenced to death yesterday af­ter he was found guilty of mur­der­ing his In­done­sian girl­friend.</p>
    <p>Ahmed Salim, 31, had stran­gled do­mes­tic worker Nurhi­day­ati Wartono Su­rata in a room at the Golden Dragon Ho­tel in Gey­lang on the evening of Dec 30, 2018.</p>
    <p>Ju­di­cial Com­mis­sioner Mavis Chionh con­victed Ahmed of a charge of mur­der, which car­ries the manda­tory death penalty.</p>
    <p>Ahmed did not re­act as the judge gave him a death sen­tence.</p>
    <p>The court ear­lier heard that Ahmed and Ms Nurhi­day­ati started a re­la­tion­ship in May 2012 af­ter a chance en­counter.</p>
    <p>They later agreed to get mar­ried in De­cem­ber 2018, with Ahmed even putting a ring on her fin­ger at a party in 2017.</p>
    <p>In 2018, she ad­mit­ted to see­ing an­other man, but Ahmed and Ms Nurhi­day­ati rec­on­ciled and re­sumed dat­ing each other a few months later.</p>
    <p>Some time in late 2018, she be­gan dat­ing Mr Han­ifa Mo­ham­mad Abu, a Bangladesh­i gen­eral fit­ter.</p>
    <p>On Dec 9, 2018, she told Ahmed that she had a new boyfriend and that he should re­turn home for his ar­ranged mar­riage, which his mother had ear­lier or­gan­ised to take place last year.</p>
    <p>She broke up with him over a phone call later that month, but they met again at the Golden Dragon Ho­tel on Dec 30 that year.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Hay Hung Chun said ear­lier in court that Ahmed threat­ened to kill Ms Nurhi­day­ati if she did not end her re­la­tion­ship with Mr Han­ifa.</p>
    <p>“When the de­ceased re­fused, the ac­cused bru­tally stran­gled her with a towel around her neck,” said the DPP.</p>
    <p>Ahmed then wound a rope – which he had brought with him – around her neck sev­eral times, tight­ened it with a few knots, and twisted her head from left to right.</p>
    <p>Her body was found at about 10.15pm that day by a ho­tel re­cep­tion­ist. The po­lice ar­rested Ahmed at around 10.45am the next day.</p>
    <p>Break­ing down in tears mul­ti­ple times in court ear­lier, Ahmed had said he had been an­gry with the woman for re­peat­edly cheat­ing on him but that he let it go be­cause he loved her.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Ju­di­cial Com­mis­sioner Chionh found that Ahmed had de­cided to kill Ms Nurhi­day­ati even be­fore Dec 30, 2018, if she re­fused to leave her new boyfriend and get back with him. This was borne out in his ac­tions, such as tak­ing a rope to the ho­tel and clear­ing out his bank ac­count ear­lier on the day of the mur­der, among other things.</p>
    <p>The judge also noted the state­ments that Ahmed made to the po­lice in which he ad­mit­ted he had de­cided to kill the vic­tim.</p>
    <p>The judge re­jected the de­fence’s ar­gu­ment that Ahmed had been pro­voked by Ms Nurhi­day­ati, who al­legedly said the other man was bet­ter than him fi­nan­cially and in bed. The judge found that the vic­tim had said no such thing, not­ing that Ahmed men­tioned the in­ci­dent only 11/</p>
    <p>2 years af­ter the mur­der.</p>
    <p>Ju­di­cial Com­mis­sioner Chionh also did not ac­cept the de­fence’s con­tention that Ahmed’s men­tal re­spon­si­bil­ity for the killing was re­duced due to his ad­just­ment dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>His de­ci­sion-mak­ing abil­ity and his abil­ity to ex­er­cise self­con­trol were not im­paired, she said. “On the con­trary, as I have noted, his ac­tions be­fore, dur­ing and af­ter the killing demon­strated pre­med­i­ta­tion, co­gent plan­ning and me­thod­i­cal ex­e­cu­tion.”</p>
    <p>The judge also re­jected Ahmed’s al­le­ga­tion that he was sui­ci­dal at the time. His lawyers said their client is in­tend­ing to ap­peal against the court’s de­ci­sion.</p>
