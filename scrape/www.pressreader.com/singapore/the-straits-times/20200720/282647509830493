    <p>KAZA­KHSTAN • Iman­bek Zeikenov is 19 and lives with his par­ents in the small vil­lage of Aksu i n Kaza­khstan. He stud­ied rail­way en­gi­neer­ing at school and, un­til last De­cem­ber, held a day job at his lo­cal train sta­tion.</p>
    <p>But ev­ery­thing changed in sum­mer last year, when he dis­cov­ered a song called Roses by the Guyane­seAmer­i­can rap­per and singer Saint Jhn. On the raw, sinewy Roses, which had al­ready been com­mer­cially avail­able for three years, Saint Jhn sings ex­plic­itly about a night on the prowl.</p>
    <p>Iman­bek’s take pitches up Jhn’s voice into a manic squeal. He added a thick, rub­bery bass line and a snare drum rat­tling in the dis­tance.</p>
    <p>He posted his remix on Rus­sian so­cial me­dia with­out giv­ing it a sec­ond thought and re­turned a few months later, sur­prised to learn he was a pop star.</p>
    <p>“I made an il­le­gal remix,” Iman­bek said through a trans­la­tor over a Zoom call. He was sit­ting in his newly bought car and wear­ing a red-and-white Kappa top.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know how to pro­mote it be­cause I didn’t know how to clear it. So, I just put it on­line and let it go. A few months later, it blew up the whole world.”</p>
    <p>Four years after the ini­tial re­lease of Roses, Iman­bek’s remix is an in­ter­na­tional smash. The song is No. 5 on the US Bill­board Hot 100 and reached No. 1 on Bri­tain’s chart.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, Iman­bek is no longer an un­sanc­tioned artist. At the end of last Au­gust, he signed with the Rus­sian la­bel Ef­fec­tive Records. The fol­low­ing month, he reached a deal with Saint Jhn to of­fi­cially re­lease the ac­ci­den­tal col­lab­o­ra­tion as a sin­gle.</p>
    <p>Iman­bek started col­lect­ing rev­enue from Roses last year, earn­ing enough to quit his job, though Ef­fec­tive Records owner Kir­ill Lupinos said cheques from the first half of this year, when the sin­gle ex­ploded, are not due un­til later this year.</p>
    <p>De­spite their prof­itable part­ner­ship, Iman­bek and Saint Jhn have yet to meet in per­son.</p>
    <p>“I’m per­form­ing in Rus­sia,” Saint Jhn said in an in­ter­view with Ge­nius last year, mar­vel­ling at how au­di­ences re­acted to Roses de­spite not speak­ing English. “Not be­cause I’m try­ing to per­form in Rus­sia, be­cause Rus­sia is re­quest­ing me, de­mand­ing I come. That’s sur­real.”</p>
    <p>Right now, Iman­bek is plot­ting his next move. In May, he put out a chilly house tune called I’m Just Feelin’ (Du Du Du), a col­lab­o­ra­tion with Dan­ish pro­ducer Martin Jensen.</p>
    <p>He does not yet know how to DJ, so live dates, even vir­tual ones, be­cause of the pan­demic, are out of the ques­tion for now.</p>
    <p>He is still mak­ing mu­sic on his 10-year-old lap­top us­ing a copy of FL Stu­dio, but his sole up­grade has been a new pair of head­phones, cour­tesy of his la­bel.</p>
    <p>The only re­cur­ring re­minders of his new­found fame are the e-mails, What­sApp mes­sages and In­sta­gram mes­sages that have flooded his in­box from artists in­quir­ing about po­ten­tial col­lab­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“One of the lat­est was from Tiesto,” he said, re­fer­ring to the star DJ. “He reached out to me and said he ap­pre­ci­ates what I’m do­ing and wished me good luck.”</p>
