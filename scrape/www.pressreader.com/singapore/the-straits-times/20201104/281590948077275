    <p>A law passed in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day will pro­vide a uni­ver­sal four­month ex­ten­sion for con­struc­tion projects to be com­pleted, in­clud­ing Build-To-Or­der flats.</p>
    <p>It will also al­low prop­erty buy­ers who in­cur out-of-pocket costs due to con­struc­tion de­lays – like rent­ing a place to stay – to seek re­im­burse­ment from devel­op­ers, in­clud­ing the Hous­ing Board.</p>
    <p>Con­trac­tors will also have to coshare 50 per cent of ad­di­tional non-man­power costs such as equip­ment rental and stor­age of ma­te­ri­als with their sub­con­trac­tors and sup­pli­ers, capped at a monthly value of 0.2 per cent of the con­tract sum.</p>
    <p>The to­tal claimable amount is capped at 1.8 per cent of the con­tract value.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment passed these re­lief mea­sures for the built en­vi­ron­ment sec­tor un­der the third set of amend­ments to the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Na­tional Developmen­t Des­mond Lee said the mea­sures will pro­vide fur­ther sup­port to the con­struc­tion in­dus­try and en­sure the pains caused by the pan­demic will be shared among con­trac­tors, devel­op­ers and buy­ers.</p>
    <p>The uni­ver­sal four-month ex­ten­sion to con­struc­tion project dead­lines ac­counts for the de­lay in con­struc­tion works due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions in the first half of this year, he added.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion works were first forced to stop be­tween April 7 and June 1 dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, and by at least another two months as dor­mi­to­ries hous­ing mi­grant work­ers were cleared only in Au­gust, he noted dur­ing the de­bate on the amend­ment Bill.</p>
    <p>“This uni­ver­sal ex­ten­sion of time will re­duce the ad­min­is­tra­tive bur­den for con­trac­tors, so that they can fo­cus on restart­ing and ramp­ing up work quickly and safely,” said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>Con­trac­tors will also be able to avoid pay­ing liq­ui­dated dam­ages un­der their con­tracts for de­lays be­tween Feb 1 this year and March 31 next year, by serv­ing a no­ti­fi­ca­tion of re­lief on the de­vel­oper.</p>
    <p>Devel­op­ers, in­clud­ing HDB, would also have a sim­i­lar four­month ex­ten­sion to the date of de­liv­ery of hous­ing, com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial prop­erty un­der the mea­sures, said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>This ex­ten­sion would cover only con­tracts that were en­tered into be­fore March 25, and where the de­vel­oper was re­quired to de­liver the prop­erty to the buyer on or after Feb 1.</p>
    <p>The first per­mit to carry out struc­tural works by the Com­mis­sioner of Build­ing Con­trol for the prop­erty must also have been is­sued be­fore April 7, and the Tem­po­rary Oc­cu­pa­tion Per­mit must not have been granted as at April 7.</p>
    <p>Devel­op­ers that need an ex­ten­sion of more than four months will have to seek an as­ses­sor ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) to de­ter­mine if the fur­ther de­lay was ma­te­ri­ally caused by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, home and prop­erty buy­ers who in­curred out-of­pocket costs due to the de­lays would be able to seek re­im­burse­ment from devel­op­ers for up to 70 per cent of the liq­ui­dated dam­ages payable in the pur­chase agree­ment.</p>
    <p>For HDB flats, the pre­scribed liq­ui­dated for­mula would be 10 per cent per year of 60 per cent of the new flat price.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty buy­ers and devel­op­ers that dis­agree on the re­im­burse­ment amount can turn to a MinLaw-ap­pointed as­ses­sor to make the fi­nal de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, con­trac­tors that have to co-share ad­di­tional non­man­power costs could claim these costs through their reg­u­lar progress pay­ments.</p>
    <p>If there are dis­putes, con­trac­tors can submit an ad­ju­di­ca­tion ap­pli­ca­tion un­der the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion In­dus­try Se­cu­rity of Pay­ment Act (Sopa).</p>
    <p>Sopa ad­ju­di­ca­tors will de­ter­mine whether the re­lief ap­plies and the co-shar­ing amount be­tween the par­ties.</p>
