    <p>ROME • The Au­tumn Na­tions Cup game be­tween Fiji and Italy on Satur­day in An­cona has been called off fol­low­ing 29 pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus cases within the Fiji team, Six Na­tions Rugby an­nounced on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“Tour­na­ment or­gan­is­ers re­main in con­stant con­tact with the Fi­jian squad to ad­dress the sit­u­a­tion. The main pri­or­ity at present is the wel­fare of all play­ers and man­age­ment,” the tour­na­ment or­gan­is­ers said, adding that it would re­view the po­ten­tial im­pact on Fiji’s re­main­ing matches.</p>
    <p>Fiji are due to play Scot­land on Nov 28, while Italy, who lost their open­ing match 28-17 to Scot­land last Satur­day, next take on France in Paris on the same day.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, France were awarded a 28-0 vic­tory and a bonus point after last Sun­day’s Group B game against Fiji was also called off fol­low­ing pos­i­tive Covid-19 cases in the Fiji squad.</p>
    <p>Fiji Rugby said last week that one of their play­ers had tested pos­i­tive and Six Na­tions Rugby added that ad­di­tional tests had “re­sulted in an­other four pos­i­tive cases af­fect­ing close con­tacts as well”.</p>
    <p>France are due to play Scot­land in Ed­in­burgh on Sun­day be­fore a game against Italy on Nov 28 in the Au­tumn Na­tions Cup, a tour­na­ment cre­ated to re­place the No­vem­ber Tests after the in­ter­na­tional sched­ule was dis­rupted by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>South­ern hemi­sphere gi­ants New Zealand, South Africa and Aus­tralia typ­i­cally tour Europe at this time of the year, but travel re­stric­tions and health risks have pre­vented the teams from do­ing so.</p>
