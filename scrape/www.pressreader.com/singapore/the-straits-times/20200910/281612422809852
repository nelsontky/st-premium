    <p>Rents for Hous­ing Board flats and pri­vate apart­ments held steady last month, but leas­ing took an­other big hit, with ren­tal vol­umes fall­ing to multi-year lows and be­low cir­cuit-breaker lev­els, go­ing by flash data from real es­tate por­tal SRX Prop­erty that was re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Rents for Hous­ing Board flats and pri­vate apart­ments held steady last month but leas­ing took an­other big hit, with ren­tal vol­umes fall­ing to multi-year lows and be­low cir­cuit­breaker lev­els, go­ing by flash data from real es­tate por­tal SRX Prop­erty that was shared yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Au­gust leas­ings for pri­vate con­do­mini­ums and apart­ments tum­bled 20.4 per cent month on month to 2,716 units. This is 47 per cent lower than a year ago and 42 per cent be­low the five-year av­er­age vol­ume for last month.</p>
    <p>A 16.7 per cent fall from July to 1,025 HDB flats last month saw rentals 46.2 per cent lower than a year ago and 44.1 per cent be­low the five-year av­er­age vol­ume for that month.</p>
    <p>For condo rentals, the es­ti­mated Au­gust vol­umes would be the low­est since Fe­bru­ary 2014, while those for HDB flats would be the low­est since De­cem­ber 2010, SRX told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The sharp fall in ren­tal vol­umes, which was also seen in July, could sig­nal the start of a “domino ef­fect” for the ren­tal mar­ket, which has been ham­pered by an eco­nomic slow­down and ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment among for­eign­ers in Sin­ga­pore, said Ms Christine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the j ob sup­port schemes in­tended to help firms re­tain their Sin­ga­porean work­ers, Ms Sun added that it is “in­evitable” that the re­duc­tion in for­eign em­ploy­ment will ad­versely im­pact the leas­ing mar­ket tem­po­rar­ily.</p>
    <p>ERA Realty head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Ni­cholas Mak agreed, and said that damp­ened de­mand in both the HDB and pri­vate hous­ing mar­ket may be due to weak­ness in the wider em­ploy­ment mar­ket, which has seen job losses for some ex­pa­tri­ates.</p>
    <p>This wider de­cline has not been off­set by the in­crease in ren­tal de­mand for HDB flats from Malaysian work­ers look­ing for af­ford­able ac­com­mo­da­tion near their work­places fol­low­ing the im­ple­men­ta­tion of bor­der re­stric­tions be­tween Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore ow­ing to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>SRX flash data also showed that pri­vate apart­ment rents re­mained un­changed last month from the pre­vi­ous month, while HDB rents saw a small uptick of 0.3 per cent within the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Year on year, over­all rents for pri­vate apart­ments last month inched down by 1 per cent from a year ago and were 17.3 per cent off their peak in Jan­uary 2013.</p>
    <p>For HDB flats, rents slipped by 0.1 per cent from Au­gust last year and were 14.6 per cent lower than their peak in Au­gust 2013.</p>
    <p>Although the SRX ren­tal in­dex held steady for the pri­vate res­i­den­tial mar­ket last month, Ms Sun noted that rents have been fall­ing for six con­sec­u­tive months for lux­ury homes in the prime dis­tricts or core cen­tral re­gion.</p>
    <p>“The trends may in­di­cate that more ex­pats are mov­ing out from prime lo­ca­tions to suburban ar­eas or city fringe ar­eas, where hous­ing tends to be more af­ford­able in the light of the cur­rent eco­nomic slow­down,” she said.</p>
    <p>As for HDB rents, said Mr Mak, the 0.3 per cent month-on-month in­crease comes as a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of rel­a­tively new HDB flats com­pleted the five-year min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod this year and could be avail­able for lease.</p>
    <p>These newer flats would com­mand higher rentals com­pared with the older flats in the vicin­ity.</p>
