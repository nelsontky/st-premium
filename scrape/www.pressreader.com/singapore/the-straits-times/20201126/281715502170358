    <p>For a group of tai-tais in the city, danc­ing with­out a care in the world has proven to be quite in­fec­tious, es­pe­cially when they min­gle with oth­ers, with masks off.</p>
    <p>But the fast-ex­pand­ing Covid-19 clus­ter linked to at least 21 dance clubs in Hong Kong, and re­spon­si­ble for 250 pa­tients stricken with the disease, may not be the cause of the fourth wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The pa­tients in­clude a grow­ing list of prom­i­nent women such as bil­lion­aire Ros­sana Wang Gaw and Madam Nancy Chiu, wife of Ca­ble TV owner and Far East Con­sor­tium chair­man David Chiu.</p>
    <p>Dr Le­ung Chi Chiu of the Hong Kong Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion told The Straits Times he be­lieves the fourth wave ar­rived soon af­ter the third ebbed in early Septem­ber, as mea­sures were eased then be­fore lo­cal trans­mis­sion was elim­i­nated.</p>
    <p>He noted that the gov­ern­ment made the de­ci­sion amid eco­nomic pres­sure and be­cause peo­ple were tired of so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>With the Mid-Au­tumn and Dou­ble Ninth fes­tiv­i­ties last month, it was a recipe for “ex­ces­sive so­cial mix­ing and gath­er­ings” that led to greater lo­cal spread, he said.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions re­bounded from mid­Septem­ber to last month, and there were more than 30 lo­cal cases in the first two weeks of this month.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of the de­lay in in­sti­tu­tion of con­trol mea­sures, the in­crease in the num­ber of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions trig­gered a su­per-spread­ing event among the danc­ing club-go­ers,” said Dr Le­ung.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong yes­ter­day recorded 85 con­firmed cases, in­clud­ing one im­ported case. The source of in­fec­tion for 16 lo­cal cases is un­known.</p>
    <p>An­other 60 peo­ple are pos­i­tive af­ter pre­lim­i­nary tests, but are not con­firmed cases. The city now has</p>
    <p>5,866 cases and 108 deaths.</p>
    <p>Of the 84 lo­cal in­fec­tions, 63 were linked to the dance club clus­ter. These clubs op­er­ate as dance stu­dios and party rooms where func­tions can be held. “Even if you close down all the danc­ing fa­cil­i­ties, that would not be enough be­cause this ac­tiv­ity only con­sti­tutes a small part of the to­tal ac­tiv­i­ties in­volved (in Covid-19),” Dr Le­ung said, adding that the dancers would have come into con­tact with oth­ers in the last three weeks.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day or­dered ap­pli­ca­tions for danc­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in in­door fa­cil­i­ties it man­ages to be sus­pended from to­day, and for all such ac­tiv­i­ties to be banned from Saturday un­til fur­ther no­tice. Ear­lier, it had al­ready or­dered bars, pubs, night­clubs and saunas to close again from to­day for a week, a de­ci­sion that an­gered many in the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try who feel it is un­fair, as no clus­ters linked to the sec­tor have been de­tected.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try play­ers have said that up to half of the 1,400 li­censed bars risk fold­ing, while some larger restau­rants may also face the same fate as ban­quets are to be capped at 40 peo­ple from to­day.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the tighter rules and forced test­ing of those who have vis­ited dance clubs, Dr Le­ung thinks the gov­ern­ment needs to quickly limit a wide range of ac­tiv­i­ties to con­trol the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, civil ser­vants ought to work from home now so the pri­vate sec­tor can fol­low. Face-to-face classes must be stopped and non-es­sen­tial, re­li­gious, re­cre­ational and sports ac­tiv­i­ties that in­volve crowds must be sus­pended. “If you want to con­tain a ma­jor for­est fire in­volv­ing mul­ti­ple spots, you need to con­tain the spread of the fire be­sides try­ing to put out the fires that are burn­ing,” Dr Le­ung said.</p>
    <p>He warned that if health fa­cil­i­ties are over­whelmed, the out­break could go out of con­trol and “that would not be re­solved un­til we have the vac­cines avail­able”.</p>
