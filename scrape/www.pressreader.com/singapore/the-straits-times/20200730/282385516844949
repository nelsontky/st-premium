    <p>ROME • Mis­fir­ing Fer­rari have com­plete con­fi­dence in team boss Mat­tia Binotto but can­not ex­pect to re­turn to win­ning ways in For­mula One be­fore 2022, com­pany chair­man John Elkann said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The team are For­mula One’s old­est and most suc­cess­ful but the cur­rent car is too slow and they are fifth in the con­struc­tors’ stand­ings af­ter the first three races. The next race is this week­end’s Bri­tish Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is that our car is not com­pet­i­tive. You’ve seen it on the track and you’ll see it again,” Elkann said in an in­ter­view with La Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
    <p>“To­day we are lay­ing the foun­da­tions to be com­pet­i­tive and back to win­ning when the rules change in 2022. I am sure of this,” he added.</p>
    <p>Fer­rari were run­ners-up last sea­son but Mercedes have won an un­prece­dented six suc­ces­sive con­struc­tors’ ti­tles and are favourites to make it seven this year af­ter a dom­i­nant start.</p>
    <p>Sweep­ing tech­ni­cal and sport­ing rule changes that were due to come in next year have been post­poned to 2022 due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, with teams con­tin­u­ing to use this year’s cars next year.</p>
    <p>Elkann said their 2020 car has struc­tural weak­nesses that have been around for some time in aero­dy­nam­ics and ve­hi­cle dy­nam­ics, and had lost engine power.</p>
    <p>He asked ‘suf­fer­ing’ fans to be pa­tient, re­call­ing that Fer­rari’s golden era with seven-time world cham­pion Michael Schu­macher only came af­ter a long drought.</p>
    <p>Schu­macher j oined Fer­rari i n 1996 and had to wait un­til 2000 for his first ti­tle with them, the third of his ca­reer, to end a 21-year wait for the Maranello-based team.</p>
    <p>Fer­rari, who last won a ti­tle in 2008, have had four team prin­ci­pals in six sea­sons but Elkann said Binotto was fully sup­ported.</p>
    <p>“Com­plete con­fi­dence,” he de­clared. “Also be­cause Mat­tia Binotto, who has been at the helm for a year, has all the com­pe­ten­cies and char­ac­ter­is­tics to start off a new win­ning cy­cle.</p>
    <p>“He was at Fer­rari with (for­mer team boss Jean) Todt and Schumi, he knows how to win. From next year he will be work­ing with two young driv­ers as am­bi­tious as us.”</p>
    <p>Asked whether Fer­rari were right not to re­new the con­tract of four-time world cham­pion Se­bas­tian Vet­tel, who is leav­ing at the end of this year, Elkann said it was harder to re­build with those who have al­ready won than those yet to suc­ceed. Fer­rari have Mone­gasque Charles Le­clerc on a long-term con­tract with Spa­niard Carlos Sainz join­ing from McLaren next year.</p>
    <p>Le­clerc has 18 points from three races, al­ready sig­nif­i­cantly be­hind Lewis Hamil­ton’s lead­ing 63-point haul, while Vet­tel has just nine.</p>
