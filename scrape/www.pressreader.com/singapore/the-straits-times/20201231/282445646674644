    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Eco­nomic shocks like the coro­n­avirus pan­demic ar­rive only once ev­ery few gen­er­a­tions, and they bring about per­ma­nent and far-reach­ing change.</p>
    <p>Mea­sured by out­put, the world econ­omy is well on the way to re­cov­ery from a slump the likes of which barely any of its 7.7 bil­lion peo­ple have seen be­fore in their life­times. Vac­cines should ac­cel­er­ate the re­bound next year. But other lega­cies of Covid-19 will shape global growth for years to come.</p>
    <p>Some are al­ready dis­cernible. The takeover of fac­tory and ser­vice jobs by ro­bots will ad­vance, while white-col­lar work­ers will get to stay home more. There will be more in­equal­ity be­tween and within coun­tries. Govern­ments will play a larger role in the lives of cit­i­zens, spend­ing – and ow­ing – more money.</p>
    <p>Here is an over­view of some of the trans­for­ma­tions un­der way.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>RE­TURN OF BIG GOVERN­MENT</p>
    <p>Big govern­ment staged a come­back as the so­cial con­tract be­tween so­ci­ety and state was rewrit­ten on the fly. It be­came com­mon­place for the authoritie­s to track where peo­ple went and who they met, and to pay their wages when em­ploy­ers could not man­age it.</p>
    <p>In coun­tries where free-mar­ket ideas had reigned for decades, safety nets had to be patched up.</p>
    <p>To pay for these in­ter­ven­tions, the world’s govern­ments ran bud­get deficits adding up to US$11 tril­lion (S$14.6 tril­lion) this year, ac­cord­ing to McKin­sey & Co. There is al­ready a de­bate about how long such spend­ing can con­tinue, and when tax­pay­ers will have to start foot­ing the bill.</p>
    <p>At least in de­vel­oped economies, ul­tra-low in­ter­est rates and un­fazed fi­nan­cial mar­kets do not point to a near-term cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In the longer run, a big re­think in eco­nom­ics is chang­ing minds about public debt. The new con­sen­sus says govern­ments have more room to spend in a low-in­fla­tion world and should use fis­cal pol­icy more proac­tively to drive their economies. Mod­ern Mon­e­tary The­ory ad­vo­cates say they pi­o­neered those ar­gu­ments and the main­stream is only now catch­ing up.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>EVEN EAS­IER MONEY</p>
    <p>Cen­tral banks were plunged back into print­ing money. In­ter­est rates hit new record lows. Cen­tral bankers stepped up their quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing, widen­ing it to buy cor­po­rate as well as govern­ment debt.</p>
    <p>All these mon­e­tary in­ter­ven­tions have cre­ated some of the eas­i­est fi­nan­cial con­di­tions in his­tory – and un­leashed a frenzy of spec­u­la­tive in­vest­ment, which has left plenty of an­a­lysts wor­ried about moral haz­ards ahead. But the cen­tral-bank poli­cies will be hard to re­verse, es­pe­cially if labour mar­kets re­main frac­tured and com­pa­nies con­tinue their re­cent run-up in sav­ing.</p>
    <p>And his­tory shows that pan­demics de­press in­ter­est rates for a long time, ac­cord­ing to a pa­per pub­lished this year. It found that a quar­ter-century after a dis­ease struck, rates were typ­i­cally about 1.5 per­cent­age points lower than they oth­er­wise would have been.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>DEBTS AND ZOM­BIES</p>
    <p>Govern­ments offered credit as a life­line dur­ing the pan­demic – and busi­ness grabbed it. One re­sult was a surge in cor­po­rate debt lev­els across the de­vel­oped world. The Bank for In­ter­na­tional Set­tle­ments cal­cu­lates that non-fi­nan­cial com­pa­nies bor­rowed a net US$3.36 tril­lion in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>With rev­enues plung­ing in many in­dus­tries be­cause of lock­downs or con­sumer cau­tion, and losses eat­ing into busi­ness bal­ance sheets, the con­di­tions are in place for a “ma­jor cor­po­rate sol­vency cri­sis”, ac­cord­ing to one new re­port.</p>
    <p>Some see dan­ger in of­fer­ing too much sup­port for com­pa­nies, with too lit­tle dis­crim­i­na­tion over who re­ceives it. They say it is a recipe for cre­at­ing “zom­bie firms” that can­not sur­vive in a free mar­ket and are kept alive only by state aid, mak­ing the whole econ­omy less pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>By one es­ti­mate, zom­bie firms – com­pa­nies that are not earn­ing enough to cover their in­ter­est ex­penses – are sit­ting on an un­prece­dented US$2 tril­lion of obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>GREAT DI­VIDES</p>
    <p>The stim­u­lus de­bate can feel like a first-world lux­ury. Poor coun­tries lack the re­sources to pro­tect jobs and busi­nesses – or in­vest in vac­cines – the way wealth­ier peers have done, and they will need to tighten belts sooner or risk cur­rency crises and cap­i­tal flight.</p>
    <p>The World Bank warns that the pan­demic is spawn­ing a new gen­er­a­tion of poverty and debt tur­moil, and the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund says de­vel­op­ing na­tions risk be­ing set back by a decade.</p>
    <p>Cred­i­tor govern­ments in the Group of 20 have taken steps to ease the plight of the poor­est bor­row­ers, but they have been slammed by aid groups for of­fer­ing only lim­ited debt re­lief and fail­ing to get pri­vate in­vestors into the plan.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>K-SHAPED</p>
    <p>Low-pay­ing work in ser­vices, where there is more face-to­face con­tact with cus­tomers, tended to dis­ap­pear first as economies locked down. And fi­nan­cial mar­kets, where as­sets are mostly owned by the rich, came roar­ing back much faster than job mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The up­shot has been la­belled a “K-shaped re­cov­ery”. The virus has widened in­come or wealth gaps across fault lines of class, race and gen­der.</p>
    <p>Women have been hit dis­pro­por­tion­ately hard – partly be­cause they are more likely to work in the in­dus­tries that strug­gled, but also be­cause they had to shoul­der much of the extra child­care bur­den as schools closed. In Canada, women’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in the labour force fell to the low­est since the mid-1980s.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>RISE OF THE RO­BOTS</p>
    <p>Covid-19 trig­gered new con­cerns about phys­i­cal con­tact in in­dus­tries where so­cial dis­tanc­ing is tough, like re­tail, hos­pi­tal­ity or ware­hous­ing. One fix is to re­place the hu­mans with ro­bots.</p>
    <p>Re­search sug­gests that au­to­ma­tion of­ten gains ground dur­ing a re­ces­sion. In the pan­demic, com­pa­nies ac­cel­er­ated work on ma­chines that can check guests into ho­tels, cut sal­ads at restau­rants, or col­lect fees at toll booths. And shop­ping moved fur­ther on­line.</p>
    <p>These in­no­va­tions will make economies more pro­duc­tive. But they also mean that when it is safe to go back to work, some jobs just will not be there. And the longer peo­ple stay un­em­ployed, the more their skills can at­ro­phy – some­thing econ­o­mists call “hys­tere­sis”.</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>YOU’RE ON MUTE</p>
    <p>Higher up the in­come lad­der, re­mote of­fices sud­denly be­came the norm. One study found that two-thirds of US gross do­mes­tic prod­uct in May was gen­er­ated by peo­ple work­ing at home.</p>
    <p>Many com­pa­nies told em­ploy­ees to stay away from the of­fice well into next year, and some sig­nalled that they would make flex­i­ble work per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>Work­ing from home has mostly passed the tech­nol­ogy test, giv­ing em­ploy­ers and staff new op­tions.</p>
    <p>That is a worry for busi­nesses cater­ing to the old in­fra­struc­ture of of­fice life, from com­mer­cial real es­tate to food and trans­port. It is a boon for those build­ing a new one: Shares in videoconfe­rencing plat­form Zoom jumped more than six times this year.</p>
    <p>The op­tion of re­mote work, along with fear of the virus, also trig­gered a stam­pede of ur­ban­ites to­wards the sub­urbs or coun­try­side – and in some coun­tries, a surge in ru­ral prop­erty prices.</p>
    <p>8</p>
    <p>NOT GO­ING ANY­WHERE?</p>
    <p>Some kinds of travel came to a near halt. Global tourism fell 72 per cent this year up to the end of Oc­to­ber, ac­cord­ing to the United</p>
    <p>Na­tions. McKin­sey reck­ons a quar­ter of busi­ness trips could dis­ap­pear for­ever as meet­ings move on­line.</p>
    <p>With va­ca­tions up­ended and mass events like fes­ti­vals and con­certs called off, the trend among con­sumers to favour ex­pe­ri­ences over goods has been dis­rupted. And when ac­tiv­i­ties do re­sume, they may not be the same.</p>
    <p>“We still don’t know how con­certs are go­ing to be, re­ally,” says Mr Rami Haykal, co-owner of the Else­where venue in Brook­lyn. “Peo­ple will be more mind­ful, I think, of per­sonal space, and avoid­ing places that are overly packed.”</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers may have to carry health cer­tifi­cates and pass through new kinds of se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong-based China Tech Global has de­vel­oped a mobile dis­in­fec­tion booth that it is try­ing to sell to air­ports. Chief ex­ec­u­tive Sammy Tsui says it can clear pathogens from the body and clothes in 40 sec­onds or less.</p>
    <p>“You feel some cool air on your body, and some mist,” he says. “But you don’t feel wet.”</p>
    <p>9</p>
    <p>A DIF­FER­ENT GLOB­AL­I­SA­TION</p>
    <p>When Chi­nese fac­to­ries shut down early in the pan­demic, it sent shock waves through sup­ply chains ev­ery­where, and made busi­nesses and govern­ments re­con­sider their reliance on the world’s man­u­fac­tur­ing pow­er­house.</p>
    <p>Swe­den’s NA-KD.com, for ex­am­ple, is part of a flour­ish­ing “fast fash­ion” re­tail in­dus­try that moves with so­cial me­dia trends rather than the tra­di­tional sea­sons. After de­liv­er­ies were jammed this year, the com­pany shifted some pro­duc­tion from China to Tur­key, said head of in­bound and cus­toms Ju­lia As­sars­son.</p>
    <p>That is an ex­am­ple of glob­al­i­sa­tion ad­just­ing with­out re­treat­ing. In other ar­eas, the pan­demic may en­cour­age politi­cians who ar­gue that it is risky to rely on im­ports of goods vi­tal to na­tional se­cu­rity – as ven­ti­la­tors and masks turned out to be this year.</p>
    <p>With va­ca­tions up­ended and mass events like fes­ti­vals and con­certs called off, the trend among con­sumers to favour ex­pe­ri­ences over goods has been dis­rupted. And when ac­tiv­i­ties do re­sume, they may not be the same. “We still don’t know how con­certs are go­ing to be, re­ally,” says Mr Rami Haykal, co-owner of the Else­where venue in Brook­lyn. “Peo­ple will be more mind­ful, I think, of per­sonal space, and avoid­ing places that are overly packed.”</p>
    <p>10</p>
    <p>GO­ING GREEN</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, it was mainly en­vi­ron­men­tal­ists mus­ing over the­o­ries of peak oil – the idea that the rise of elec­tric ve­hi­cles could per­ma­nently dent the world’s de­mand for one of the most pol­lut­ing fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>But when this year saw planes grounded and peo­ple stay­ing home, even oil ma­jors like BP felt a real threat from the world get­ting se­ri­ous about cli­mate con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Govern­ments from Cal­i­for­nia to Bri­tain announced plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2035. And Mr Joe Bi­den was elected on a prom­ise that the United States will re­join the Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change.</p>
