    <p>From to­day, peo­ple who were in higher-risk lo­ca­tions – such as din­ing places and gyms – at the same time as a Covid-19 case will be no­ti­fied through an SMS alert.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple will also be able to use their TraceTo­gether app to check if they were in close prox­im­ity to some­one with the coro­n­avirus, the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Of­fice (SNDGO) an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health cur­rently pub­lishes a list of pub­lic lo­ca­tions vis­ited by Covid-19 cases dur­ing the pe­riod when they were in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>More than 90 such places were listed over the last five weeks.</p>
    <p>The SNDGO said the self-check­ing ser­vice, known as the SafeEn­try Lo­ca­tion Match­ing Self-Check ser­vice, is be­ing launched in re­sponse to pub­lic feed­back.</p>
    <p>It will be avail­able on an up­dated ver­sion of the TraceTo­gether app from to­day. The ser­vice can also be ac­cessed via SingPass Mo­bile or at https://werey­outhere.safeen­try.gov.sg</p>
    <p>SMS no­ti­fi­ca­tions will be sent only to a smaller group of in­di­vid­u­als whose SafeEn­try check-in and check-out tim­ings over­lap with Covid-19 cases in the high­er­risk lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The SNDGO called on in­di­vid­u­als to pro­vide up­dated phone num­bers for their TraceTo­gether app as well as to check in and check out of lo­ca­tions promptly us­ing SafeEn­try, so as to avoid any er­ro­neous no­ti­fi­ca­tions. It also asked busi­nesses to pro­vide ac­cu­rate SafeEn­try ad­dress records.</p>
    <p>“This also helps our con­tact trac­ers more ac­cu­rately es­tab­lish links and trans­mis­sion chains,” said the SNDGO.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Smart Na­tion Ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day that prompt con­tact trac­ing is key to fight­ing the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“We are deal­ing with an in­fec­tion. By def­i­ni­tion, there is al­ways a trans­mis­sion chain – mean­ing I must have been in­fected by some­body else, and if the pan­demic is to con­tinue, I must in turn in­fect some­body else next along the chain,” said Dr Balakr­ish­nan, who is also For­eign Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of peo­ple who would be in­fected is di­rectly re­lated to how quickly we can iden­tify and iso­late the per­son,” he added.</p>
