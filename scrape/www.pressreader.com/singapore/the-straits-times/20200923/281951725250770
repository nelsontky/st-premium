    <p>WASH­ING­TON Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg will lie in state in the US Capi­tol’s Stat­u­ary Hall on Fri­day, an un­usual hon­our for a Supreme Court jus­tice that has not been be­stowed since the death of Mr Wil­liam Howard Taft – who served as chief jus­tice from 1921 to 1930 af­ter hav­ing served as pres­i­dent – and one that has never be­fore been granted to a woman.</p>
    <p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi an­nounced the rare dis­tinc­tion on Mon­day, af­ter de­scrib­ing Jus­tice Gins­burg’s death last week as “an in­cal­cu­la­ble loss for our democ­racy and for all who sac­ri­fice and strive to build a bet­ter fu­ture for our chil­dren”.</p>
    <p>The for­mal cer­e­mony at the Capi­tol will be open to in­vited guests only be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Ms Pelosi’s of­fice said.</p>
    <p>Also out of the or­di­nary, Ms Gins­burg will lie in re­pose at the Supreme Court for two days – to­day and to­mor­row – and her cof­fin will be placed un­der the por­tico at the top of the build­ing’s front steps, a set-up meant to al­low for so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>In the past, j us­tices have lain in re­pose in the Supreme Court’s Great Hall for only one day. But for a pi­o­neer­ing ad­vo­cate of women’s rights, who was also a cul­tural icon and a lib­eral hero, the ex­tra day was nec­es­sary to ac­com­mo­date the num­ber of peo­ple ex­pected to turn out to hon­our her.</p>
    <p>Ms Gins­burg died last Fri­day, and over the week­end, the side­walk in front of the court be­came the scene of an ever-grow­ing vigil. Flow­ers, hand­writ­ten notes, can­dles and mes­sages writ­ten in chalk wrapped around the side of the build­ing, and large crowds gath­ered to pay their re­spects.</p>
    <p>The White House on Mon­day said Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump planned to pay his re­spects in per­son at the Supreme Court, as then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama and his wife Michelle did in 2016, when Jus­tice An­tonin Scalia, a con­ser­va­tive icon, died. The Oba­mas were crit­i­cised, how­ever, for skip­ping his funeral and send­ing then Vice-Pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den in­stead.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign of Mr Bi­den, now the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee, has not said whether he planned to travel to Wash­ing­ton to pay his re­spects to Jus­tice Gins­burg.</p>
    <p>A pri­vate cer­e­mony in the court, which will be open only to Ms Gins­burg’s fam­ily, close friends and mem­bers of the court, will take place this morn­ing in­side the Great Hall, the court an­nounced on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>A pri­vate in­ter­ment ser­vice will be held next week at Ar­ling­ton Na­tional Ceme­tery, where Jus­tice Gins­burg’s hus­band, Mr Martin Gins­burg, was buried in 2010.</p>
