    <p>Clad in over­alls and equipped with N95 masks and face shields, a trio of sci­en­tists hud­dled over a man­hole out­side a for­eign worker dor­mi­tory. They warned the me­dia gath­ered around them last Wed­nes­day: “Stay at least 2m away.”</p>
    <p>When they were sat­is­fied that we were far away enough to avoid be­ing spat­tered by any stray droplets, they prised open the lid, and low­ered a tube into the depths of the sew­ers.</p>
    <p>They hit a few but­tons on an au­tosam­pling ma­chine, and min­utes later, they hit pay dirt – lit­er­ally.</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tists from the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency’s (NEA) En­vi­ron­men­tal Health In­sti­tute were demon­strat­ing how sewage sam­ples for a pi­lot waste­water sur­veil­lance pro­gramme are col­lected.</p>
    <p>The sam­ples, which are screened in a lab­o­ra­tory for the pres­ence of vi­ral ma­te­rial, could re­veal the level of Covid-19 spread in the dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ng Lee Ching, di­rec­tor of the En­vi­ron­men­tal Health In­sti­tute, ex­plains: “If vi­ral ma­te­rial is de­tected in the waste­water of some dor­mi­to­ries where there is no known trans­mis­sion, ad­di­tional swab tests for work­ers (there) may be ar­ranged to iden­tify cases for med­i­cal care and iso­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>This sewage sur­veil­lance pro­gramme is one of a slew of novel strate­gies that the Repub­lic has im­ple­mented in the six months since the first Covid-19 case was re­ported here on Jan 23.</p>
    <p>Hu­man tri­als for a Sin­ga­pore-de­vel­oped vac­cine will com­mence soon, and re­searchers here are study­ing not just the virus, but also how the hu­man body re­sponds to it – by scru­ti­n­is­ing the blood of re­cov­ered pa­tients for clues on how the in­vad­ing pathogen can be fought.</p>
    <p>In­sight ex­am­ines how Sin­ga­pore has en­gaged its best sci­en­tific minds in bat­tling and re­search­ing the coro­n­avirus – a foe which is still not fully un­der­stood. Says Pro­fes­sor Leo Yee Sin, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID): “The point is that the sys­tem needs to be flex­i­ble and scal­able to cope with novel viruses that may ap­pear in dif­fer­ent shapes and sizes.”</p>
    <p>ON THE LOOK­OUT</p>
    <p>Test­ing is a key en­abler in the Gov­ern­ment’s over­all ef­forts to fight Covid-19, says a Min­istry of Health (MOH) spokesman.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the speedy iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of in­fected pa­tients will al­low them to be quickly iso­lated, break­ing the chain of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tion­ally, test­ing is done by col­lect­ing swabs from pa­tients and run­ning them through a pro­ce­dure known as poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR), which de­tects the pres­ence of vi­ral ge­netic ma­te­rial in a sam­ple.</p>
    <p>Such tests are still the “gold stan­dard” for test­ing, says MOH.</p>
    <p>With the even­tual goal of do­ing 40,000 tests a day, there are on­go­ing ef­forts to make this more ef­fi­cient. Sin­ga­pore has con­ducted about 177,000 swabs per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion as of July 13, the high­est rate among Asean na­tions, ac­cord­ing to global sta­tis­tics site Worl­dome­ter.</p>
    <p>“To al­low more in­di­vid­u­als to be an­a­lysed in one test, we also con­duct pooled PCR test­ing,” says the MOH spokesman. Such pooled tests in­volve com­bin­ing swabs of up to five in­di­vid­u­als into one lab­o­ra­tory test.</p>
    <p>Where a pooled test is pos­i­tive, the in­di­vid­u­als would be retested in­di­vid­u­ally to iden­tify in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“Pooled test­ing is an ef­fec­tive strat­egy where the preva­lence of in­fec­tion is likely to be low,” says the MOH spokesman.</p>
    <p>But other novel strate­gies, such as waste­water sur­veil­lance, are also be­ing pi­loted to com­ple­ment – not re­place – ex­ist­ing test­ing meth­ods.</p>
    <p>Says NEA’s Prof Ng: “For dor­mi­to­ries in the pro­gramme with no de­tected Covid-19 cases, a zero read­ing for the vi­ral ge­netic ma­te­rial in the waste­water pro­vides the added as­sur­ance that they re­main free from in­fec­tion and al­lows work­ers to leave for work.”</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, dur­ing the demon­stra­tion of how sewage sam­ples were taken, I smelled noth­ing foul through the N95 mask de­spite the open man­hole nearby.</p>
    <p>But the murky, brown liq­uid col­lected by the auto-sam­pling ma­chine was a re­minder that test­ing can in­volve work­ing in dirty con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tif­i­cally, there were also chal­lenges to over­come.</p>
    <p>As As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Janelle Thomp­son, a prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor at the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s (NTU) Sin­ga­pore Cen­tre for En­vi­ron­men­tal Life Sci­ences En­gi­neer­ing, points out: The con­cen­tra­tion of the vi­ral genome per litre of waste­water can be about 10,000 times less con­cen­trated than the lev­els mea­sured in hu­man spu­tum (phlegm) in the first two weeks of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Says Prof Thomp­son: “This means that meth­ods are needed to con­cen­trate the vi­ral par­ti­cles be­fore re­cov­ery of the RNA (ge­netic ma­te­rial of the virus) or pro­tein sig­na­tures used for quan­tifi­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>Prof Thomp­son’s re­search cen­tre had, to­gether with other part­ners, pro­vided sci­en­tific in­put for the method­ol­ogy used to sam­ple and test waste­water for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial of test­ing waste­water as an early warn­ing sys­tem for Covid-19 was not re­alised in a Eureka mo­ment.</p>
    <p>It was de­rived from a strong sci­en­tific ba­sis.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, there have been a num­ber of sci­en­tific papers that point to the pres­ence of the virus in stool sam­ples. This in­di­cates that in­fected in­di­vid­u­als, in­clud­ing those with mild or no symp­toms, could shed the virus in their stool.</p>
    <p>And then in March, Dutch re­searchers went one step fur­ther.</p>
    <p>They did stud­ies to show the cor­re­la­tion be­tween the in­creas­ing cir­cu­la­tion of the virus in the pop­u­la­tion and an in­creased vi­ral load into the sewer sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore did its own tests on waste­water at wa­ter recla­ma­tion plants, which col­lect waste­water from all across the is­land, and found a sim­i­lar cor­re­la­tion.</p>
    <p>As of March 9, when there were 160 Covid-19 cases in Sin­ga­pore, the level of vi­ral ge­netic ma­te­rial in the waste­water was un­de­tectable.</p>
    <p>THE ROAD TO A CURE</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in Sin­ga­pore may have fallen, but life has not fully re­turned to pre-Covid days.</p>
    <p>There are vis­ual re­minders of this ev­ery­where. Face masks, once em­blem­atic of those work­ing in health­care, have be­come fash­ion ac­ces­sories that come in var­i­ous prints and colours. Large, bois­ter­ous gath­er­ings at restau­rants have dwin­dled to man­dated groups of up to five.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties say this is the way life will be – at least un­til a vac­cine is found. There have been en­cour­ag­ing de­vel­op­ments on this front.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, the global fight against Covid-19 re­ceived a boost, with the re­lease of en­cour­ag­ing find­ings from hu­man tri­als of three coro­n­avirus vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The re­sults showed that the vac­cines be­ing tested did not cause any dan­ger­ous side ef­fects, and that they could coax a pro­tec­tive re­sponse from the hu­man body.</p>
    <p>The find­ings were from the early phases of clin­i­cal tri­als for vac­cines be­ing de­vel­oped by Ox­ford Univer­sity and multi­na­tional drug­maker As­traZeneca, CanSino Bi­o­log­ics and China’s mil­i­tary re­search unit, and Ger­man biotech com­pany BioN­Tech and US drug­maker Pfizer.</p>
    <p>One such trial will soon also be held in Sin­ga­pore. As part of a Phase I/II trial, 108 healthy in­di­vid­u­als will re­ceive a dose of a vac­cine jointly de­vel­oped by Sin­ga­pore’s Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and United States phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics.</p>
    <p>This puts the Lu­nar-Cov19 vac­cine with 24 other can­di­date vac­cines around the world that are cur­rently un­der­go­ing clin­i­cal eval­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts have pointed out that while pub­lished re­sults from earlystage tri­als are en­cour­ag­ing, much more work is still needed to plug re­main­ing gaps in knowl­edge be­fore a vac­cine can be made com­mer­cially avail­able. Es­ti­mates for this range from 12 to 18 months.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor David Lye, a se­nior con­sul­tant and di­rec­tor at the NCID’s in­fec­tious dis­ease re­search and train­ing of­fice, notes that the key de­ter­mi­nant of ef­fec­tive­ness of a Covid-19 vac­cine lies in Phase III ran­domised tri­als, which have yet to start.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal de­vel­op­ment is a three­p­hase process, says the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion on its web­site.</p>
    <p>In Phase I, small groups of peo­ple re­ceive the trial vac­cine, and this is ex­panded in Phase II to in­clude peo­ple who have char­ac­ter­is­tics, such as age and phys­i­cal health, sim­i­lar to those for whom the new vac­cine is in­tended. In Phase III, the vac­cine is given to thou­sands of peo­ple and tested for ef­fi­cacy and safety.</p>
    <p>Six months since the first Covid-19 case was re­ported in Sin­ga­pore, there is still no crys­tal ball for the fu­ture, says NCID’s Prof Leo.</p>
    <p>“We are all charg­ing ahead in an un­cer­tain and rapidly evolv­ing era, and while we aim to do our best, our best is to also rely on re­gional and global ef­forts,” she says, adding that many fac­tors could in­flu­ence how the pan­demic will turn out in next six months and be­yond.</p>
    <p>But she adds: “I would like to urge all in Sin­ga­pore that we keep in tune with the evo­lu­tion and be part of the evo­lu­tion, pre­pare to change the way we so­cialise and in­ter­act with one another, and play each in­di­vid­ual part to pro­tect self and fam­ily and the wider com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>It will be chal­leng­ing, even painful, she says, adding: “Mi­crobes and hu­man are alike – we strive to sur­vive”.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry says there are lessons to be learnt from coun­tries ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a resur­gence of cases af­ter a gen­eral resumption of ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Con­tin­ued vig­i­lance and ad­her­ence to safe man­age­ment mea­sures on ev­ery­one’s part re­main im­por­tant to re­duce the spread of in­fec­tion,” says the MOH spokesman.</p>
    <p>“Un­til a vac­cine is found, we will have to get used to a new nor­mal, ad­just­ing our rou­tines to live and work safely de­spite this global pan­demic.”</p>
