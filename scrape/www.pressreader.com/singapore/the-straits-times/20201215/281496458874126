    <p>Free Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions will be of­fered to all Sin­ga­pore­ans and long-term res­i­dents who are cur­rently here, though they will be vol­un­tary, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said yesterday.</p>
    <p>Those who are at great­est risk will be given first pri­or­ity, in­clud­ing healthcare work­ers and front­line per­son­nel, as well as the elderly and vul­ner­a­ble, he said in a tele­vised ad­dress.</p>
    <p>“There­after, the com­mit­tee pro­poses to pro­gres­sively vac­ci­nate the rest of the pop­u­la­tion, and to cover ev­ery­one who wants a vac­ci­na­tion by the end of next year,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>A com­mit­tee of doc­tors and ex­perts has been set up by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) to rec­om­mend a vac­ci­na­tion strat­egy for Singapore.</p>
    <p>In a vote of con­fi­dence in the Singapore ex­perts who have al­ready given their ap­proval to the Pfiz­erBioNTech vaccine, PM Lee added that he and his col­leagues in</p>
    <p>SAFETY MEA­SURES STILL CRU­CIAL</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing and safe man­age­ment mea­sures con­tinue to be crit­i­cal un­til such a time when suf­fi­cient num­bers of our pop­u­la­tion are pro­tected.</p>
    <p>MOH’S DIREC­TOR OF MED­I­CAL</p>
    <p>SER­VICES KEN­NETH MAK, who says that while a vaccine will ex­pe­dite re­cov­ery from the pan­demic, it will take some time be­fore the world re­turns to a pre-Covid-19 nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>Cab­i­net will be get­ting vac­ci­nated early. PM Lee, who is 68, said: “This is to show you, espe­cially se­niors like me, that we be­lieve the vac­cines are safe.”</p>
    <p>His as­sur­ance comes as he an­nounced yesterday that the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity has ap­proved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for pan­demic use.</p>
    <p>The first ship­ment of the vaccine is ex­pected to ar­rive in Singapore by the end of this month, mak­ing the Re­pub­lic one of the first to ob­tain it.</p>
    <p>More vac­cines will be­come avail­able in the months ahead, he said, adding that if all goes to plan, Singapore will have enough vac­cines for ev­ery­one here by the third quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said the Gov­ern­ment has been work­ing to se­cure vaccine doses for its pop­u­la­tion since early in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He noted that while more than 200 vaccine can­di­dates were be­ing de­vel­oped, not all would suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>“We started talk­ing to the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies early to un­der­stand the science, and iden­tify the promis­ing can­di­dates and vac­cines likely to reach pro­duc­tion soon,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Singapore has set aside more than $1 bil­lion for this, and had signed ad­vance pur­chase agree­ments and made early down pay­ments for the most promis­ing can­di­dates, in­clud­ing with Pfiz­erBioNTech, Moderna and Si­no­vac.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic had also made ar­range­ments with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies to fa­cil­i­tate their clin­i­cal tri­als and drug devel­op­ment in Singapore, and at­tracted a few to es­tab­lish vaccine man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties here.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing Singapore’s own ef­forts to de­velop a Covid-19 vaccine, PM Lee said this gave sci­en­tists and re­searchers here the op­por­tu­nity to do cut­ting-edge work.</p>
    <p>Early-stage clin­i­cal tri­als for a Covid-19 vaccine co-de­vel­oped by Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics are cur­rently on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>“It was also in­surance, in case the global sup­ply chain was dis­rupted,” PM Lee said. “This way, we built up a di­ver­si­fied port­fo­lio of op­tions to en­sure that Singapore would be near the front of the queue for vac­cines, and not last in line.”</p>
    <p>While vac­ci­na­tions are vol­un­tary, PM Lee urged peo­ple here to get vac­ci­nated when one is of­fered to them. “The more of us (that) are vac­ci­nated, the harder it will be for the virus to spread, and the safer we will all be as a so­ci­ety,” he said.</p>
    <p>MOH’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yesterday that while a vaccine will ex­pe­dite re­cov­ery from the pan­demic, it will take some time be­fore the world re­turns to a pre-Covid-19 nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>“Safe dis­tanc­ing and safe man­age­ment mea­sures con­tinue to be crit­i­cal un­til such a time when suf­fi­cient num­bers of our pop­u­la­tion are pro­tected,” he said.</p>
