    <p>Swab­bers from the Health Pro­mo­tion Board (HPB) car­ried out an oropha­ryn­geal/mid­dle turbinate (OP/MT) test for Covid-19 on mi­grant work­ers yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Said to be less painful than the usual na­sopha­ryn­geal test, in which a swab is in­serted to the back of the nos­tril, the OP/MT test in­volves tak­ing a sam­ple from the back of the throat and mid­way up the nose.</p>
    <p>The tests were car­ried out at Cochrane Recre­ation Cen­tre in Sem­bawang, which is one of HPB’s 20 re­gional screen­ing cen­tres. They were done as part of ros­tered rou­tine test­ing (RRT) for work­ers, who must pass the test to be cleared for work.</p>
    <p>HPB said yes­ter­day that it in­tends to have 25 to 30 screen­ing cen­tres by the year end, two-thirds of which will carry out RRT. As part of fur­ther ef­forts to ramp up test­ing, RRT is also be­ing car­ried out at fa­cil­i­ties in 24 dor­mi­to­ries, with an­other nine such fa­cil­i­ties to be set up by the end of the month.</p>
    <p>To scale up rou­tine Covid-19 swab test­ing for mi­grant work­ers, more in-dor­mi­tory test­ing fa­cil­i­ties and re­gional screen­ing cen­tres will be set up by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>There are now 24 ros­tered rou­tine test­ing (RRT) fa­cil­i­ties in dor­mi­to­ries, with nine more to be set up by the end of this month, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) and the Health Pro­mo­tion Board (HPB) said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The in­crease in ros­tered rou­tine test­ing fa­cil­i­ties will ben­e­fit more than 35,000 mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the re­gional screen­ing cen­tre in Cochrane Recre­ation Cen­tre yes­ter­day, MOM’s As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment Group’s med­i­cal di­rec­tor Lam Meng Chon said the 33 dor­mi­to­ries were picked based on the large num­ber of work­ers stay­ing there.</p>
    <p>“These are places that have a crit­i­cal mass of mi­grant work­ers. Sta­tion­ing in-dorm RRT sta­tions within (these) dorms en­cour­ages con­ve­nience and economies of scale,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Lam noted that as at yes­ter­day, about 2,400 work­ers have still not been cleared to re­sume work as they had not com­pleted their ros­tered rou­tine test­ing.</p>
    <p>This is down from 5,700 such work­ers on Sept 18.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to work with em­ploy­ers to ex­plore ways to help them reg­is­ter their em­ploy­ees for RRT,” he said.</p>
    <p>Work­ers on shifts cur­rently have ac­cess to swab test­ing at night at fa­cil­i­ties in Aca­cia Lodge in Bukit Ba­tok, Cas­sia@Pen­juru, Cen­tral Staff Apart­ments in Bound­ary Close and Westlite Mandai in Mandai Es­tate.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers can sched­ule their work­ers’ rou­tine test­ing ap­point­ments in their dor­mi­to­ries, or at 14 of the 20 re­gional screen­ing cen­tres is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>HPB plans to have 25 to 30 screen­ing cen­tres by the year end. Twothirds of these sites will be con­duct­ing ros­tered rou­tine test­ing.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, all mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, ex­cept Toh Guan Dor­mi­tory, need to un­dergo such test­ing ev­ery two weeks as part of a multi-lay­ered strat­egy to pre­vent and de­tect new in­fec­tions ear­lier. Those in Toh Guan Dor­mi­tory are presently be­ing tested ev­ery week as part of a trial to en­hance test­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>In the screen­ing cen­tres and in­dorm fa­cil­i­ties, over 2,600 swab test</p>
    <p>These are places that have a crit­i­cal mass of mi­grant work­ers. Sta­tion­ing in-dorm RRT sta­tions within (these) dorms en­cour­ages con­ve­nience and economies of scale... We will con­tinue to work with em­ploy­ers to ex­plore ways to help them reg­is­ter their em­ploy­ees for RRT.</p>
    <p>DR LAM MENG CHON, med­i­cal di­rec­tor of MOM’s As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment Group, who said that the 33 dor­mi­to­ries were picked based on the large num­ber of work­ers stay­ing there.</p>
    <p>Work­ers and em­ploy­ers are re­minded to en­sure that those who are re­quired to un­dergo RRT con­tinue to do so, in or­der to safe­guard their health and that of the wider com­mu­nity... It is only through our col­lec­tive ef­fort that we can pre­vent, ar­rest and con­tain the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sions and in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>MIN­ISTRY OF MAN­POWER AND HEALTH</p>
    <p>PRO­MO­TION BOARD, re­it­er­at­ing that ros­tered rou­tine test­ing is a crit­i­cal part of early de­tec­tion of Covid-19, and to con­tain its spread.</p>
    <p>ing staff are on the ground ev­ery day to con­duct swab­bing and en­sure safety mea­sures are fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the 14 screen­ing cen­tres are con­duct­ing ros­tered rou­tine test­ing for mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dorms, and work­ers from the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors.</p>
    <p>These cen­tres are in places such as The Float @ Ma­rina Bay, the Old Po­lice Academy and Sin­ga­pore Turf Club.</p>
    <p>Through the on­line Swab Reg­is­tra­tion Sys­tem, em­ploy­ers can se­lect their pre­ferred swab lo­ca­tions and test­ing dates to sched­ule their work­ers for test­ing at ei­ther the in-dorm fa­cil­i­ties or the screen­ing cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Once work­ers at­tend their first rou­tine test­ing ap­point­ment, the</p>
    <p>sys­tem will au­to­mat­i­cally sched­ule them for the next ap­point­ments.</p>
    <p>Since its roll-out in Au­gust, the Swab Reg­is­tra­tion Sys­tem has seen con­tin­u­ous en­hance­ments to ease nav­i­ga­tion and pro­vide helplines for em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Lucy Tan, chief hu­man re­source of­fi­cer of NatS­teel, which has about 440 work­ers who need to un­dergo ros­tered rou­tine test­ing, said em­ploy­ers would pre­vi­ously have to rush to book slots for their work­ers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the new au­to­matic schedul­ing sys­tem re­moves the need for this and has made the process more con­ve­nient.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan added that hav­ing in­dorm swab cen­tres helps re­duce dis­rup­tions to oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“When (the work­ers) are at var­i­ous test cen­tres, we don’t know what time they will com­plete (test­ing), and pro­duc­tion has to stop be­cause we have work­ers all over. So, we can’t even func­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, hav­ing ros­tered rou­tine test­ing fa­cil­i­ties within the dorms al­lows her com­pany to or­gan­ise the work­ers’ sched­ules in a sys­tem­atic man­ner.</p>
    <p>MOM and HPB re­it­er­ated that ros­tered rou­tine test­ing is a crit­i­cal part of early de­tec­tion of Covid-19, and to con­tain its spread.</p>
    <p>“Work­ers and em­ploy­ers are re­minded to en­sure that those who are re­quired to un­dergo RRT con­tinue to do so, in or­der to safe­guard their health and that of the wider com­mu­nity,” they added.</p>
    <p>“It is only through our col­lec­tive ef­fort that we can pre­vent, ar­rest and con­tain the risk of Covid-19 trans­mis­sions and in­fec­tions.”</p>
