    <p>The find­ings of the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment’s study on the long-last­ing im­pact of di­vorce on chil­dren were sober­ing to read (Di­vorce in­flicts long-last­ing toll on chil­dren: MSF study, Dec 9).</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, it is not dif­fi­cult to imag­ine such ad­verse con­se­quences af­fect­ing chil­dren from di­vorced fam­i­lies; some of the young peo­ple we work with have sim­i­lar sto­ries.</p>
    <p>As so­ci­ol­o­gist Paulin Straughan pointed out, in ev­ery di­vorce, there is a high like­li­hood of a draw­down on the fam­ily’s fi­nan­cial, so­cial and emo­tional as­sets. This, in turn, af­fects the child in dif­fer­ent ways.</p>
    <p>Re­search has con­sis­tently shown that chil­dren thrive un­der the sta­bil­ity and se­cu­rity of a lov­ing and healthy fam­ily.</p>
    <p>With­out the sta­bil­ity pro­vided by a healthy mar­riage, a child faces greater risk of men­tal health prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have found de­pres­sion and anx­i­ety rates to be higher in chil­dren of di­vorced par­ents.</p>
    <p>While the Gov­ern­ment pro­vides var­i­ous ser­vices tar­get­ing the fam­ily – from mar­riage prepa­ra­tion pro­grammes to free on­line coun­selling to agen­cies pro­vid­ing di­vorce sup­port – it is nec­es­sary to keep the fo­cus up­stream.</p>
    <p>Rather than lend sup­port when the mar­riage hits rock bot­tom, why not jour­ney with young cou­ples and help them build a strong foun­da­tion for their lives?</p>
    <p>What does this foun­da­tion en­tail?</p>
    <p>To sta­bilise their mar­riage and set them­selves up for suc­cess, ev­ery cou­ple re­quires cer­tain skills and sup­port.</p>
    <p>Specif­i­cally, re­la­tional skills such as ef­fec­tive com­mu­ni­ca­tion, con­flict res­o­lu­tion and ac­tive lis­ten­ing come to the fore.</p>
    <p>In ev­ery con­flict sit­u­a­tion, each party also needs to be able to sus­pend his or her own judg­ment and take the other per­son’s per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>Through some of Fo­cus on the Fam­ily Sin­ga­pore’s mar­riage work­shops such as Con­nect2, we equip young cou­ples and new­ly­weds to recog­nise their own com­mu­ni­ca­tion habits and to be aware of their spouse’s com­mu­ni­ca­tion style.</p>
    <p>We also equip them to ad­dress com­mon con­flict trig­ger points, such as re­la­tion­ships with in-laws and parenting val­ues, and to ap­pre­ci­ate how their dif­fer­ent fam­ily back­grounds have shaped the way they live.</p>
    <p>It is time to fu­ture-proof gen­er­a­tions by in­vest­ing in healthy and lov­ing homes.</p>
    <p>This can be achieved by giv­ing young cou­ples, as well as those who have been mar­ried for some time, the skills and re­sources to man­age their re­la­tion­ship well and com­mu­ni­cate ex­pec­ta­tions re­spect­fully.</p>
    <p>It would mean not just stronger cou­ples and lower di­vorce rates, but also health­ier, more re­silient gen­er­a­tions raised in these homes down the line.</p>
