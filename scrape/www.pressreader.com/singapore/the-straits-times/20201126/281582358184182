    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) will be con­duct­ing Covid-19 test­ing near Lit­tle In­dia MRT sta­tion for stall­hold­ers in and around Tekka Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The test­ing op­er­a­tions, to take place to­day, are part of the pro­gres­sive roll­out of com­mu­nity surveil­lance test­ing, said MOH yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry an­nounced seven new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, all of which were im­ported. They had been placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from worker’s dor­mi­to­ries for the 15th day in a row.</p>
    <p>This is the long­est stretch with­out a com­mu­nity case since the first coro­n­avirus case was re­ported in Sin­ga­pore on Jan 23. There were 12 days be­tween the first re­ported case, which was im­ported, and the first recorded com­mu­nity cases on Feb 4.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,190.</p>
    <p>Of the seven new cases, one is a 58-year-old male per­ma­nent res­i­dent who re­turned from In­dia.</p>
    <p>The oth­ers are a 22-year-old fe­male stu­dent pass holder who also re­turned from In­dia, and four work per­mit hold­ers aged be­tween 23 and 41 who re­turned from In­dia,</p>
    <p>In­done­sia and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing case is a 36-yearold male short-term visit pass holder who ar­rived from Ukraine to board a ship docked in Sin­ga­pore as a crew mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with no new cases in the past week, said MOH.</p>
    <p>With 12 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,076 pa­tients have fully re</p>
    <p>cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 42 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal while 29 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. One pa­tient is in crit­i­cal con­di­tion in the in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
