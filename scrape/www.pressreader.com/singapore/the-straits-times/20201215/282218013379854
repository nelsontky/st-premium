    <p>Ground-han­dler and in-flight caterer Sats has emerged top among 100 Singapore pub­licly listed com­pa­nies in the 2019 Asean Cor­po­rate Gover­nance Score­card (ACGS) – jump­ing 10 places from its 11th po­si­tion in 2017.</p>
    <p>Held bi­en­ni­ally, the ACGS is part of an ini­tia­tive un­der the Asean Cap­i­tal Mar­kets Fo­rum, a high­level group­ing of cap­i­tal mar­ket reg­u­la­tors. Apart from Singapore, coun­tries that par­tic­i­pated in the lat­est as­sess­ment in­cluded In­done­sia, Malaysia, Thai­land, the Philip­pines and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>The do­mes­tic rank­ing bod­ies of each coun­try as­sessed a list of top 100 pub­licly listed com­pa­nies by mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion in their ju­ris­dic­tions, and the top 35 com­pa­nies from each coun­try then un­der­went peer re­view as­sess­ment ran­domly by the do­mes­tic rank­ing bod­ies of the other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal scores of th­ese com­pa­nies were de­rived af­ter dis­cus­sions by the rank­ing bod­ies, pro­duc­ing a list of com­pa­nies in Asean that had achieved a min­i­mum score of 75 per cent out of 130 points, a list of the top 20 com­pa­nies in Asean, and a list of the top three com­pa­nies in each coun­try.</p>
    <p>Across the re­gion, bank­ing group AMMB Hold­ings placed among Malaysia’s top three, while Bank CIMB Ni­aga was one of the fron­trun­ners for In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Philip­pine prop­erty de­vel­oper Ayala Land, Thai petroleum and en­ergy con­glom­er­ate Bangchak Cor­po­ra­tion and Viet­namese in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy firm FPT Cor­po­ra­tion were among the three top scor­ers in their re­spec­tive coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Singapore (NUS) Busi­ness School’s Cen­tre for Gover­nance, In­sti­tu­tions and Or­gan­i­sa­tions (CGIO) as well as the Singapore In­sti­tute of Di­rec­tors (SID) made up the do­mes­tic rank­ing body. The two have been ap­pointed by the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Singapore as the Re­pub­lic’s rank­ing body for the Asean Cor­po­rate Gover­nance Ini­tia­tive since 2013.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment yesterday, CGIO and SID said Singapore com­pa­nies “put in a strong show­ing” this year, with 26 com­pa­nies scor­ing at least 75 per cent of the to­tal at­tain­able 130 points.</p>
    <p>Com­ing in be­hind Sats with 119.7 points were United Over­seas Bank and the Singapore Ex­change, fol­lowed by Sing­tel in fourth place and OCBC Bank in fifth.</p>
    <p>On aver­age, Singapore com­pa­nies scored 88.3 out of 130 points, the high­est score to date.</p>
    <p>Mr John Lim, chair­man of the cor­po­rate gover­nance bench­marks com­mit­tee at SID, said: “It is most en­cour­ag­ing to note the sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ment in aver­age scores for Singapore’s top 100 com­pa­nies in the lat­est as­sess­ment, and we com­mend them on this achieve­ment.”</p>
    <p>Across Asean, com­pa­nies in Thai­land had the high­est aver­age score of 96.6 points, fol­lowed by Malaysia with an aver­age of 95 points. Com­pa­nies in the Philip­pines scored an aver­age of 77.2 points, while In­done­sian com­pa­nies had 70.8 points and Viet­nam firms had 54.6 points.</p>
    <p>The ACGS scores cover com­po­nents such as rights of share­hold­ers, eq­ui­table treat­ment of share­hold­ers, role of share­hold­ers, dis­clo­sure and trans­parency as well as re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of the board.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies in Singapore recorded higher scores across all five com­po­nents in Level 1 com­pared with 2017, with scores in the role of share­hold­ers ris­ing the most at 2.4 points, while eq­ui­table treat­ment of share­hold­ers rose the least at 0.1 point.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim noted that com­pa­nies “should be able to do even bet­ter with greater dis­clo­sures of their cor­po­rate gover­nance prac­tices”, adding that “good dis­clo­sure” is an area where lo­cal com­pa­nies have lagged be­hind some of their Asean coun­ter­parts in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Of the top 20 pub­licly listed com­pa­nies across Asean, Malaysian com­pa­nies dom­i­nated the list, tak­ing a to­tal of seven spots. Singapore com­pa­nies came in sec­ond with five, while Thai­land and the Philip­pines tied with four each.</p>
    <p>CGIO direc­tor Lawrence Loh of NUS Busi­ness School said: “As a mem­ber of the Asean mar­ket, it is im­por­tant for Singapore to push the cor­po­rate gover­nance stan­dards of Asean as a bloc, so as to in­crease the at­trac­tive­ness of Asean to global in­vestors.”</p>
