    <p>Roughly one in 10 peo­ple may have been in­fected with the coro­n­avirus, leav­ing the vast ma­jor­ity of the world vul­ner­a­ble to Covid-19, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s top emer­gency ex­pert said yes­ter­day. Dr Mike Ryan added that out­breaks were surg­ing in parts of South-east Asia, and cases and deaths were on the rise in parts of Europe.</p>
    <p>Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin will be un­der self-quar­an­tine for 14 days, af­ter be­ing in con­tact with a min­is­ter who later tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, Tan Sri Muhyid­din said that de­spite all his re­cent tests for the coro­n­avirus be­ing neg­a­tive, he would still be ob­serv­ing self-quar­an­tine, as ad­vised by the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>“This will not af­fect gov­ern­ment af­fairs. I will con­tinue to work from home and have video calls for meet­ings that have to be chaired by me,” he said.</p>
    <p>“As a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, I have been un­der­go­ing swab tests to de­tect Covid-19 ev­ery two weeks since April ... and all these de­tec­tion tests have been con­firmed to be neg­a­tive,” he added. “I did three Covid-19 tests in the past three weeks on Sept 22, 26, 29 and they were found to be neg­a­tive.”</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, Mr Muhyid­din chaired a Covid-19 min­is­te­rial spe­cial meet­ing at the Prime Min­is­ter’s De­part­ment. Among those at the meet­ing was de facto Is­lamic Af­fairs Min­is­ter Zulk­i­fli Mo­hamad Al­Bakri, who an­nounced yes­ter­day that he had the virus.</p>
    <p>It is learnt that other min­is­ters who were at the meet­ing have been ad­vised to go on home quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, Dr Zulk­i­fli said: “To all Malaysians, I am cur­rently un­der treat­ment af­ter be­ing tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19... my health is good.”</p>
    <p>He also urged those who at­tended the same events as him be­tween Sept 24 and Oct 4 to get tested im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond time that Mr Muhyid­din has had to be on home quar­an­tine. On May 22, he ob­served a 14-day quar­an­tine af­ter an of­fi­cer at a post-Cabi­net meet­ing he chaired tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has seen a re­cent spike in coro­n­avirus cases, mostly re­lated to elec­tion cam­paign­ing in Sabah, a new virus hot spot.</p>
    <p>The coun­try re­ported a record 432 new cases yes­ter­day, the high­est daily num­ber since the pan­demic hit the coun­try. This brings the to­tal cases since the out­break be­gan to 12,813.</p>
    <p>No new fa­tal­i­ties were re­ported, keep­ing the death toll at 137.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak’s 1MDB trial was de­layed as he was serv­ing a two-week home quar­an­tine af­ter trav­el­ling to Sabah, where a state elec­tion was held on Sept 26.</p>
    <p>The trial will re­sume on Oct 19.</p>
