    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You en­counter a new idea or per­son this morn­ing that fills you with hope and ex­cite­ment. It may re­late to love, work or travel.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You need to po­lice some­one who is out of line – though it may take all your en­ergy to keep him from caus­ing any se­ri­ous prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You are not quite sure what to think, but you are al­most cer­tainly in the right place to change your mind – for the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your brain is more pow­er­ful than any other part of your body.</p>
    <p>You can con­vince peo­ple through the power of ar­gu­ment.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You need to adapt to new cir­cum­stances. You are pretty sure you know you are right, but can­not quite con­vince oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Your ex­per­i­men­tal ideas are weird to out­siders, but you can tell that you are onto some­thing.</p>
    <p>Things can change for the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your so­cial wis­dom is a po­tent force – so make sure you are pay­ing at­ten­tion when peo­ple are speak­ing.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Con­flict is al­most cer­tainly on the agenda. You find that peo­ple are will­ing to cede you some au­thor­ity if you set the stakes high enough.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Ideas and plans need in­put to come to com­ple­tion suc­cess­fully and you need to make sure you are talk­ing to the right peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Look into your fi­nances – a loan or a debt prob­lem that has been bug­ging you for a while. You can turn a bad sit­u­a­tion up­side-down.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your in­nate ge­nius is vis­i­ble to all. Share your ideas and see who bites. Those are the folk you need to stick with for the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You need to spend time think­ing about the fu­ture and what you want – but there is no need to plot it all out to the last de­tail.</p>
