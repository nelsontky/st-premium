    <p>I re­fer to Mr Chiew Boon Leong’s Fo­rum let­ter (Drama se­ries not a case of dis­crim­i­na­tion against group, July 20).</p>
    <p>First, threats and abu­sive mes­sages which were sent to Bran­don Wong and Kym Ng, are never the way to make a point or solve dis­agree­ments. It is wrong and un­fruit­ful to re­sort to such tac­tics.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, I would like to ad­dress Mr Chiew’s point that as the show was a de­pic­tion of ev­ery­day life in Singapore, the story could have been about a bad fa­ther phys­i­cally or sex­u­ally abus­ing his child, and it would “not make much sense for fathers to be up in arms over the de­pic­tion of an abu­sive fa­ther in a drama se­ries”.</p>
    <p>To be clear, any such abuse is ab­hor­rent re­gard­less of gen­der or sex­u­al­ity.</p>
    <p>But Mr Chiew’s ex­am­ple is a false equiv­a­lent. Fathers in gen­eral are not a group who have to put up with dis­crim­i­na­tion in their daily lives just be­cause they are fathers.</p>
    <p>But people within the LGBTQ (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer) com­mu­nity face con­stant chal­lenges to their dig­nity, hav­ing to deal with many un­truths, mis­con­cep­tions and base­less neg­a­tive stereo­types paint­ing them in gen­er­ally un­favourable terms. All this over and above many other sub­tle forms of ca­sual dis­crim­i­na­tion to­wards them.</p>
    <p>While the show’s sto­ry­line may in and of it­self not be dis­crim­i­na­tory, it could in­ad­ver­tently re­in­force such false stereo­types.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine a story por­tray­ing false stereo­types about a mi­nor­ity race rather than sex­u­al­ity. Maybe then the con­cern will be more ob­vi­ous.</p>
