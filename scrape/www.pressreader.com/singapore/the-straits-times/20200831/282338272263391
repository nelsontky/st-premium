    <p>Be­set by de­lays and un­fore­seen events that re­sulted in its re­lease date be­ing pushed back four times, The New Mu­tants – the last in­stal­ment in the X-Men su­per­hero fran­chise (2000 to present) – has fi­nally opened in cine­mas world­wide.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at an on­line fan event last month, the di­rec­tor and cast of the film – a su­per­hero-hor­ror story about five young mu­tants held cap­tive be­cause of their pow­ers – spoke of the pent-up ex­cite­ment that both they and their fans have ex­pe­ri­enced.</p>
    <p>This was be­cause of all the fits and starts that plagued the project, from reshoots to cre­ative dis­agree­ments over its un­usual blend of gen­res and, fi­nally, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial re­lease of April 2018 was post­poned to Fe­bru­ary and then Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic then put paid to the orig­i­nal re­lease date of April this year, but the film fi­nally opened in the­atres in Sin­ga­pore and world­wide last week.</p>
    <p>“We’re all ex­cited for the fans to be able to see it,” says a vis­i­bly re­lieved Josh Boone, The New Mu­tants’ writer and di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Every­body’s been wait­ing so long and they’re so en­thu­si­as­tic on­line, and peo­ple have been so re­spon­sive to the trail­ers,” says the 41-year-old, who di­rected the ro­man­tic drama The Fault In Our Stars (2014).</p>
    <p>But the long wait may have helped the film by build­ing an­tic­i­pa­tion among fans. So says Bill Sienkiewic­z, the artist who worked on the comic­book se­ries on which the movie is based, which was cre­ated by Chris Clare­mont in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>It was Sienkiewic­z’s strik­ing avant-garde il­lus­tra­tions – which com­ple­mented the dark tone of the tale of young su­per­heroes in train­ing – that dis­tin­guished the se­ries for many comic-book afi­ciona­dos.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple have talked about this be­ing a ‘cursed’ film be­cause it’s taken for­ever,” says Sienkiewic­z, a 62-year-old Eis­ner Award win­ner. “But I think in some re­spects, the lock­down has just amped up the level of in­ter­est. Peo­ple are re­ally ra­bid for this.”</p>
    <p>If fan art for the new movie is any­thing to go by, he may be right.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore it came out, the movie in­spired a prodi­gious amount of draw­ings by fans, which the cast oohed and aa­hed over as they were shown a few on screen.</p>
    <p>“The fan art’s been so amaz­ing to see,” says Maisie Wil­liams, the 23-year-old Game Of Thrones (2011 to 2019) star who plays Rahne, a Scot­tish teenager with the abil­ity to morph into a wolf.</p>
    <p>“With the de­lay of the film, it feels like so many peo­ple have just used that time to do this.”</p>
    <p>Boone adds: “They send it to us and we try to put it on our (so­cial me­dia) streams... It’s fans who have stolen ev­ery frame of all the trail­ers to try to put to­gether the movie, which is amaz­ing.”</p>
    <p>Henry Zaga – who plays Roberto, a Brazil­ian mu­tant with the abil­ity to ma­nip­u­late so­lar en­ergy – chuck­les as he re­calls the pe­ri­odic bursts of ex­cite­ment on so­cial me­dia over the last two years.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery three months, we’d get this wave of ex­cite­ment,” says the 27-year-old, who ap­peared in teen drama 13 Rea­sons Why (2017 to present) in 2017.</p>
    <p>Zaga is one of the newer faces in the cast, the most recog­nis­able be­ing Wil­liams, along with Anya Tay­lor-Joy (Split, 2016) and Char­lie Heaton (Stranger Things, 2016 to present).</p>
    <p>Wil­liams says she found it much eas­ier to play this char­ac­ter than the one for which she is best known: the war­rior girl Arya Stark on Game Of Thrones.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause Rahne’s per­son­al­ity is closer to her own. “When I play Arya, I al­ways have to com­mand the room and be re­ally brave and strong. And that’s kind of ex­haust­ing and I don’t re­ally feel like that,” the English ac­tress says.</p>
    <p>“So it was re­ally lovely to play some­one like Rahne, who re­ally is just sit­ting and watch­ing and listening. She comes to life when she is with Dani (Blu Hunt), but in the group, she’s some­what quiet and keeps to her­self.”</p>
    <p>Even though she was com­ing from a very dif­fer­ent fan­tasy uni­verse and fan­dom with Game Of Thrones, X-Men and New Mu­tants fans seemed to have em­braced her, Wil­liams says. “The whole fan base has been just so welcoming. And this whole su­per­hero world is just bonkers, but I love it.”</p>
