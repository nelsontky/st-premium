    <p>In­dia has re­ported nearly 2.5 mil­lion cases of Covid-19, the third worst-hit coun­try in the world, but con­cerns are grow­ing over the pan­demic spread­ing to ru­ral ar­eas, where 70 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion lives.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cases in ma­jor cities like Mum­bai and Delhi, once hot spots, ap­pears to be sta­bil­is­ing, but in­fec­tions are ris­ing in smaller towns and ru­ral ar­eas in sev­eral ma­jor states such as Bi­har, Ut­tar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.</p>
    <p>“When this pan­demic be­gan, it was through peo­ple com­ing in from other coun­tries... It was then lo­calised in ur­ban ar­eas and big cities. When the un­lock­ing took place and peo­ple mi­grated from ur­ban to ru­ral (ar­eas)... it started spread­ing in ru­ral ar­eas,” said Dr Ra­jni Kant, head of the re­search man­age­ment, pol­icy, plan­ning and co­or­di­na­tion cell at the state-run In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search (ICMR). The “un­lock­ing” re­ferred to the eas­ing of strin­gent re­stric­tions im­posed as part of a lock­down in March.</p>
    <p>Bi­har and Ut­tar Pradesh, in par­tic­u­lar, wit­nessed the re­turn of hun­dreds of thou­sands of mi­grant work­ers to vil­lages and smaller towns from the cities. All were fear­ful of the pan­demic and had fled home after los­ing their jobs. “Still, in ru­ral ar­eas, the pop­u­la­tion den­sity is low com­pared with ur­ban parts. The only prob­lem is that health in­fra­struc­ture is not as good as in ur­ban ar­eas,” said Dr Kant.</p>
    <p>In­dia im­posed a strin­gent lock­down in late March, bring­ing eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and cross-coun­try move­ment of peo­ple to a halt.</p>
    <p>Nearly all re­stric­tions have been eased in stages, but how the sit­u­a­tion evolves in ru­ral In­dia could pose an­other ma­jor chal­lenge for the gov­ern­ment as the num­ber of cases seems to be climb­ing in­ex­orably.</p>
    <p>“At the mo­ment, we are see­ing the smaller towns af­fected and spo­radic re­ports in ru­ral In­dia are com­ing in. With­out ad­e­quate test­ing, it is dif­fi­cult to say how much the virus is spread­ing in ru­ral parts. The ma­jor re­ports of large-scale cases of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion, at the mo­ment, are still in the smaller towns, district towns... We have to wait and see how ru­ral ar­eas are af­fected,” said Pro­fes­sor K. Sri­nath Reddy, pres­i­dent of the Pub­lic Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia and a mem­ber of the gov­ern­ment’s national task force on Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“In Pak­istan and Bangladesh, it got con­trolled in cities and towns, and ru­ral ar­eas were not too af­fected. Can we have a sim­i­lar ex­pe­ri­ence? We have to wait and see,” he added.</p>
    <p>A Lancet study last month said sev­eral dis­tricts in nine ma­jor states, in­clud­ing the poor­est states of Bi­har, Mad­hya Pradesh and Ut­tar Pradesh with big ru­ral pop­u­la­tions, were vul­ner­a­ble to new in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Con­trol­ling in­fec­tions in the ru­ral ar­eas will be a lot more dif­fi­cult than in ur­ban cen­tres. The wear­ing of masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing, for ex­am­ple, are not as strictly prac­tised as in the ur­ban ar­eas, where en­force­ment, in­clud­ing po­lice ac­tion, is also stronger.</p>
    <p>Mr Javed Jung, a farmer in the district of Shamli, an over­whelm­ingly ru­ral district in Ut­tar Pradesh, spoke of hear­ing of Covid-19 cases where once there was none.</p>
    <p>“First. it was not there at all. Now, we are hear­ing cases from the vil­lages. But test­ing is also in­creas­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Shamli has re­ported 224 cases. Pro­fes­sor Sud­hir Pan­war of Luc­know Univer­sity in Ut­tar Pradesh be­lieves the virus is also mov­ing into the vil­lages through markets where farm­ers go to sell their pro­duce.</p>
