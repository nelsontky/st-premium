    <p>Whether read leisurely over a cup of kopi or flipped through on the MRT, The Straits Times has been the sta­ple for in-depth cov­er­age of news, en­ter­tain­ment and just about ev­ery­thing else about Sin­ga­pore, as well as for­eign de­vel­op­ments, for gen­er­a­tions of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>To com­mem­o­rate its 175th an­niver­sary, The Straits Times asked about 30 read­ers and in­dus­try lead­ers to share their views on its role in Sin­ga­pore and their ex­pec­ta­tions for the news­pa­per in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral wrote in, re­flect­ing on how it has been an in­te­gral part of ev­ery­day life.</p>
    <p>For Mr Nigel Tan, 58, his ear­li­est mem­o­ries of the pa­per were of his fa­ther brows­ing through it each morn­ing. “Be­ing a school­teacher, he felt that he had to ed­u­cate his stu­dents on the im­por­tance of gen­eral knowl­edge, and one of the best ways was by read­ing the news­pa­per,” said Mr Tan, who is semi-re­tired.</p>
    <p>Over the years, read­ing the pa­per has be­come his pri­mary source of in­for­ma­tion on world events and lo­cal hap­pen­ings.</p>
    <p>The pa­per was also a reg­u­lar fix­ture in Mr Mor­gan Yeo’s house­hold.</p>
    <p>“From read­ing about the lat­est news, to cut­ting out key ar­ti­cles for English lessons and fight­ing with my broth­ers to have the first go at the car­toons sec­tion... It en­cour­aged me to be cu­ri­ous about the world around me, es­pe­cially in a time with­out the In­ter­net,” said the 32-year-old, who is di­rec­tor of wood­work­ing firm Roger&Sons.</p>
    <p>For Mr Sui Wei San, 41, an ST reader for more than 30 years, the pa­per has served as a life­long com­pan­ion. “When I was young, the Life sec­tion was my favourite ow­ing to the TV list­ings and comics... As I en­tered the work­force, I be­came more aware of world news and hap­pen­ings.”</p>
    <p>The pa­per also has a spe­cial place for those in busi­ness, sports and the arts.</p>
    <p>Cre­ative Tech­nol­ogy founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Sim Wong Hoo said he has “been read­ing The Straits</p>
    <p>Times every day for 50 years, de­spite the rise of new me­dia ev­ery­where now”.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank group CEO Sa­muel Tsien drew com­par­isons be­tween the bank and the pa­per, high­light­ing how both had “seen Sin­ga­pore through the highs and the lows” and ex­panded their cov­er­age “be­yond Sin­ga­pore to the re­gion”.</p>
    <p>For­mer na­tional sprinter C. Ku­nalan com­mended ST’s sports news re­port­ing and hopes it will con­tinue to be the “daily wake-up drug” of many Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing been an ST reader from the 1950s, read­ing about sports and sports achieve­ments... and then be­ing fea­tured my­self from the mid-1960s till the present, I see how ST has ful­filled one of its many roles of con­vey­ing sports news, in­spir­ing past, present and fu­ture sports­men,” said the 77-year-old.</p>
    <p>The Nec­es­sary Stage founder Alvin Tan felt the arts scene also owed some­thing to the news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>“Sure, the re­la­tion­ship be­tween jour­nal­ists cov­er­ing the arts beat and the arts com­mu­nity is filled with ups and downs... Yet, through it all, in the broad­est of the hu­man mind, we were all work­ing to­wards grow­ing the arts in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>The pa­per has adapted from print to tablet, and Mr Ed­ward Yee, 25, a Rhodes Scholar and for­mer Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity vale­dic­to­rian, be­lieves it re­mains just as im­por­tant, if not more so, in the dig­i­tal age.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing ahead, I see a rapidly chang­ing news land­scape and the rise of fake news, democra­tised re­port­ing and new on­line medium... I be­lieve The Straits Times could be a bas­tion of crit­i­cal, truth­ful and in­sight­ful re­port­ing, help­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans nav­i­gate the years to come,” said Mr Yee.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said the pa­per should con­tinue to en­gage younger read­ers.</p>
    <p>“With our lives be­com­ing in­creas­ingly en­twined with so­cial me­dia, I look for­ward to see­ing The Straits Times con­tinue to reach out to the younger gen­er­a­tion on this plat­form,” he added.</p>
