    <p>The up­com­ing Amer­i­can pres­i­den­tial elec­tion is more a Trump ver­sus Trump con­test than Trump ver­sus Bi­den. Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re-elec­tion bid is, quite nat­u­rally, be­ing treated by vot­ers as a ref­er­en­dum on his first term. Un­til late Jan­uary, when the first coro­n­avirus case was recorded in the US, Mr Trump had ex­pected by the dint of a strong econ­omy to tide over such blem­ishes as his im­peach­ment for abuse of power, a di­vi­sive record on race re­la­tions and the sub­stan­tial un­der­min­ing of the world or­der. But as Covid-19 cases rose to over five mil­lion in six months, Mr Trump’s proud­est claims on boost­ing gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, the stock mar­kets and jobs have been eclipsed by the sin­gle is­sue of how he is han­dling the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With weeks to go be­fore early vot­ing kicks off in some states and less than three months to elec­tion day, Demo­cratic Party con­tender Joe Bi­den is lead­ing Mr Trump in na­tional polls by at least six points. More sig­nif­i­cantly, in the bat­tle­ground states that de­ter­mine a win un­der the United States elec­toral col­lege sys­tem, Mr Bi­den has es­tab­lished a man­i­fest ad­van­tage. He is also clos­ing the gap in cam­paign funds, key to buy­ing ads and rais­ing turnout. His con­spic­u­ous in­vis­i­bil­ity to vot­ers, com­pared with Mr Trump’s un­wa­ver­ing pres­ence on TV and so­cial me­dia, is about to change. Next week, Mr Bi­den is ex­pected to name his run­ning mate and, on Aug 20, de­liver his nom­i­nat­ing ad­dress to make his case for the White House.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s own for­mal ad­dress as can­di­date is to fol­low a week later. Bereft of the econ­omy as his re­li­able vote catcher, he has strug­gled to ex­pand be­yond his base and re­pair his ap­proval rat­ings. In re­cent days, he has tried to for­tify his coro­n­avirus re­sponse, en­cour­ag­ing the use of masks and of­fer­ing more cau­tious pro­nounce­ments. But the virus has suc­ceeded in drain­ing a vi­tal chan­nel to vot­ers – his charged per­for­mances be­fore thou­sands of loy­al­ists in hours-long ral­lies. Still, the three pres­i­den­tial de­bates be­fore the elec­tion may al­low him to land some con­vinc­ing punches. The for­mat is said to suit Mr Trump’s con­tentious style and dis­ad­van­tage the gaffe-prone Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>But the big­gest test is for the elec­toral sys­tem, re­shaped like never be­fore by the virus. In the last elec­tion, a quar­ter of the votes were mailed in. This Novem­ber, when the Covid-19 death toll in the US is pro­jected to touch a quar­ter of a mil­lion, postal bal­lots will rise as long queues ap­pear as health haz­ards. The im­pli­ca­tions could be ugly. Demo­cratic vot­ers tend to favour postal bal­lots, which Mr Trump has de­nounced as fraud-prone. If more em­brace postal bal­lots, which can be cast un­til elec­tion day, the results could be de­layed. Vot­ers and can­di­dates may sus­pect foul play and ques­tion the le­git­i­macy of the elec­tion. Some will in­fer in­ter­fer­ence from China or Rus­sia, as flagged by in­tel­li­gence agen­cies. For the 244-year-old repub­lic, this chal­lenge to in­tegrity will bear watch­ing.</p>
