    <p>New pay­ment trends this year</p>
    <p>Soumya Basu</p>
    <p>The Daily Star, Bangladesh</p>
    <p>Last year was like no other for dig­i­tal pay­ments. As economies came to a stand­still, con­sumers piv­oted to on­line shopping and busi­nesses turned to re­mote de­liv­ery and dig­i­tal ac­cep­tance.</p>
    <p>In early 2020, dig­i­tal took cen­tre stage as many of­fline and neigh­bour­hood stores closed and some switched to re­mote de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>A co­hort of first-time e-com­merce shop­pers emerged as con­sumers started pa­tro­n­is­ing stores with an on­line pres­ence.</p>
    <p>This year will see fur­ther evo­lu­tion in this be­hav­iour. In­te­grated com­merce will be­come com­mon­place with new-age dis­tri­bu­tion chan­nels and mar­ket ag­gre­ga­tors in­sert­ing them­selves into the value chain.</p>
    <p>With per­sonal and dis­cre­tionary ex­pen­di­tures plum­met­ing, af­ford­abil­ity has be­come a cen­tral theme, lead­ing to busi­nesses and con­sumers wel­com­ing Buy Now, Pay Later op­tions, in­ject­ing speed, flex­i­bil­ity and con­ve­nience in pay­ing.</p>
    <p>This year will wit­ness an ex­plo­sion of mass af­ford­abil­ity so­lu­tions of­fered by mer­chants, man­u­fac­tur­ers, mar­ket­places and, of course, banks and fin­techs.</p>
    <p>Last year, in more ways than one, was about go­ing “con­tact­less”. As peo­ple get fa­mil­iar with scan­ning QR codes, con­sumers will pay in mul­ti­ple ways with­out mak­ing con­tact at mer­chant lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>In 2021, small busi­ness own­ers will con­tinue to look for ways to stay con­nected with con­sumers and lever­age dig­i­tal mar­ket­places. This will help them gain ex­po­sure to new seg­ments, se­cure new leads, pro­vide 24/7 ac­cess to prod­ucts and cre­ate ex­pe­ri­ences for dig­i­tal-first cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>The in­creased dig­i­tal mi­cro, small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (MSME) foot­print will open the gates to MSME credit go­ing main­stream this year.</p>
    <p>Given the shift to on­line-first of­fer­ings, in­vest­ments in cy­ber se­cu­rity and au­then­ti­ca­tion will take prece­dence, es­pe­cially for small busi­nesses that are not as equipped to han­dle fraud as big firms are. Re­dou­bling busi­ness com­mit­ment to se­cu­rity will catal­yse in­no­va­tion in pay­ment se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­gat­ing fin­tech firms</p>
    <p>Edi­to­rial</p>
    <p>China Daily, China</p>
    <p>With ad­vanced tech­nol­ogy, big data and abun­dant cap­i­tal, In­ter­net fi­nance has de­vel­oped at a tremen­dous speed in China, pos­ing huge challenges to fi­nan­cial su­per­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>It is no sur­prise that – with the au­thor­i­ties act­ing to bet­ter reg­u­late the de­vel­op­ment of the in­dus­try so as to give full play to its good points and avoid its short­com­ings – in­dus­try leader Ant Group should be the first to come un­der scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>But the on­go­ing probe has pro­vided suf­fi­cient signs that what the ad­min­is­tra­tive de­part­ments are try­ing to do is not just to reg­u­late one com­pany but, rather, the en­tire In­ter­net fi­nan­cial sec­tor, as China’s cen­tral bank vice-pres­i­dent Pan Gong­sheng re­cently told the me­dia.</p>
    <p>There is no doubt that China needs a boom­ing In­ter­net fi­nan­cial in­dus­try. But the mag­ni­tude of the an­titrust in­ves­ti­ga­tion sig­nals that the State is in­tent on strength­en­ing its su­per­vi­sion of the in­dus­try to pre­vent il­le­gal fi­nan­cial ac­tiv­i­ties, curb un­fair com­pe­ti­tion and nip risks in the bud.</p>
    <p>Given their deep pen­e­tra­tion into the na­tional econ­omy and so­ci­ety, In­ter­net fi­nan­cial firms must be­come more aware of their re­spon­si­bil­i­ties. They are obliged to be­have them­selves, bear­ing the in­ter­ests of the coun­try and peo­ple in mind.</p>
    <p>The probes are not a means to set­tle ac­counts but, rather, a means to help the en­ter­prises as well as the whole in­dus­try to out­line a road map into the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The case for su­per-apps</p>
    <p>De­vie Rah­mawati</p>
    <p>The Jakarta Post, In­done­sia</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, the need for tech­nol­ogy has be­come even more crit­i­cal. From de­vices to In­ter­net ac­cess to pro­duc­tiv­ity – these can no longer be ex­cluded from our daily lives.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of In­ter­net users now ex­ceeds 4.39 bil­lion peo­ple glob­ally, and from year to year, there has been an ap­prox­i­mate 10 per cent in­crease in global In­ter­net users.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in In­done­sia don’t want to miss out on the trends in dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy. Since 2019, around</p>
    <p>355 mil­lion dig­i­tal de­vices have been owned by 268 mil­lion In­done­sians.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has in­creased the com­plex­ity and pro­duc­tiv­ity of a job. Rou­tines have be­come duller with a lot of tasks, goals and end­less de­mands for pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Even though work­ing from home can be con­sid­ered re­lax­ing, the re­al­ity comes across dif­fer­ently. The lines have been blurred and the home is no longer a sa­cred space where work is off-lim­its. As work be­comes more com­plex, more ob­sta­cles have also come to the fore.</p>
    <p>Tech­ni­cal bar­ri­ers such as ac­cess have cropped up with more peo­ple us­ing dig­i­tal de­vices, es­pe­cially for those who live in far-flung ar­eas with low net­work con­nec­tiv­ity and in­com­pat­i­ble de­vices. Another ob­sta­cle in achiev­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity is the nav­i­ga­tion and op­er­a­tion of an ap­pli­ca­tion or the Web.</p>
    <p>De­spite dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy help­ing work and hu­man ac­tiv­i­ties in gen­eral, in prac­tice this has also re­sulted in greater com­plex­ity and higher pro­duc­tiv­ity de­mands.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ingly seg­mented jobs and unattain­able on­line ac­tiv­i­ties call out for in­no­va­tion. Tech­nol­ogy de­vel­op­ers have been look­ing for so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Cre­at­ing a su­per-app is one such po­ten­tial so­lu­tion to the prob­lem. For ex­am­ple, an e-com­merce app is a com­mon su­per-app.</p>
    <p>In e-com­merce apps, we find mer­chants, e-wal­lets, chats, blog re­views, de­liv­ery ser­vices and even games. Users do not need to use sep­a­rate ap­pli­ca­tions for each fea­ture.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, a su­per-app to sup­port pro­duc­tiv­ity is still rare and users still use sep­a­rate apps to sup­port hy­per-pro­duc­tiv­ity, which can be tremen­dously time-con­sum­ing and even counter-pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>There­fore, a dig­i­tal col­lab­o­ra­tion su­per-app like Lark is needed. By us­ing a dig­i­tal col­lab­o­ra­tion su­per-app, we can ex­pect to re­duce tech­ni­cal bar­ri­ers and con­straints of­ten en­coun­tered by other pro­duc­tiv­ity apps; a hy­per-pro­duc­tiv­ity medium for work and study dur­ing or af­ter the Covid-19 pan­demic; and a bench­mark for other su­per-apps within the pro­duc­tiv­ity land­scape for fu­ture in­no­va­tions.</p>
