    <p>ABU DHABI • Three days be­fore head­lin­ing UFC 254 in Abu Dhabi, the main at­trac­tion, Khabib Nur­magome­dov, told re­porters he planned to re­tire as the un­de­feated, undis­puted Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship (UFC) light­weight cham­pion.</p>
    <p>He seemed to mean he would make that move even­tu­ally. It turns out he in­tended to do it im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian needed less than two rounds on Satur­day night to dispatch a hard-punch­ing Amer­i­can chal­lenger, Justin Gaethje, in the main event of a fight card that the UFC ex­pected to threaten pay-per­view records.</p>
    <p>His win uni­fied the UFC light­weight ti­tle, so­lid­i­fied his place as the mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) or­gan­i­sa­tion’s top fighter, and was his first win af­ter the death of his fa­ther and trainer, Ab­dul­manap, 57.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his vic­tory, Khabib took the mi­cro­phone dur­ing a post-fight in­ter­view and said he was leav­ing the sport. “No way I’m go­ing to come here (again) with­out my fa­ther,” he said. “I’m the UFC undis­puted, un­de­feated cham­pion with a 13-0 record (in the pro­mo­tion), and 29-0 in all of my pro MMA ca­reer.”</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old’s em­phatic win over Gaethje was the in-com­pe­ti­tion high point of a tu­mul­tuous 2020 for MMA.</p>
    <p>He started the year slated to face Tony Fer­gu­son in April at the Bar­clays Cen­tre in Brook­lyn, but the card was post­poned be­cause of the pan­demic and the UFC moved it even­tu­ally to Jack­sonville, Florida.</p>
    <p>With Khabib un­able to re­turn to the United States from Rus­sia be­cause of travel re­stric­tions, Gaethje re­placed him as Fer­gu­son’s op­po­nent, then pounded out a onesided, five-round tech­ni­cal knock­out win.</p>
    <p>In July, Ab­dul­manap, who had trained Nur­magome­dov since he was three, died of Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Still, Khabib, a re­lent­less wrestler who is also adept with punches and kicks, agreed to face Gaethje in a tan­ta­lis­ing match-up of styles.</p>
    <p>His op­po­nent’s high-im­pact strik­ing earned him the nick­name “The High­light” and he had not lost in the UFC in over two years.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a cau­tious first minute in their fight, Khabib ap­plied pres­sure, ab­sorb­ing heavy blows from Gaethje and in the sec­ond, he saw an op­por­tu­nity to take him down.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Gaethje tried to land two hard kicks in suc­ces­sion, Khabib grabbed his foot be­fore maul­ing him. The 31-year-old sub­mit­ted barely two min­utes into the round, with the win earn­ing Khabib a US$50,000 (S$67,860) cash bonus for the best per­for­mance of the night.</p>
    <p>Af­ter­wards, he laid his gloves on the oc­tagon can­vas and ex­plained that he and his mother agreed he should re­tire. He said: “When UFC comes to me about Justin I spoke with my mother for three days. She didn’t want me to fight with­out fa­ther and I said this is my last fight – and I have given her my word.”</p>
    <p>Dana White, the UFC pres­i­dent, claimed post-fight that he did not be­grudge Khabib his re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>“What he’s been through, we’re all lucky we got to see him fight tonight,” he said, re­veal­ing the Rus­sian had com­peted with bro­ken bones in his foot.</p>
    <p>Long-time ri­val Conor McGre­gor, who tapped out to Khabib in their Oc­to­ber 2018 bout, and Ju­ven­tus star Cris­tiano Ron­aldo were among many who led the trib­utes.</p>
    <p>McGre­gor, who re­tired in June but has teased a re­turn, tweeted: “Good per­for­mance Team Khabib. I will carry on. Re­spect and con­do­lences on your fa­ther again also. To you and fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Ron­aldo posted on In­sta­gram, writ­ing: “Con­grats bro! Your fa­ther is proud of you!”</p>
    <p>A WIN­NER ALL THE WAY</p>
    <p>I’m the UFC undis­puted, un­de­feated cham­pion.</p>
    <p>KHABIB NUR­MAGOME­DOV, who re­tires with a 29-0 record in all MMA bouts.</p>
