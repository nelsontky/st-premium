        Insight | The Sunday Times Sunday, August 30, 2020 | B6 America votes 2020 The nuts and bolts of the US presidenti­al election Charissa Yong US Correspond­ent In Washington Americans go to the polls on Nov 3 to elect their president and vicepresid­ent for the next four years.
Their choice this year is between incumbent Republican President Donald Trump and his running mate Mike Pence, and Democratic candidate and former vice-president Joe Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris.
Here are some things to know about US elections. Q What is the electoral college? A The presidenti­al election is an indirect election. When Americans go to the polls in November, they are actually not voting directly for the president and vice-president, but for a group of people known as electors, who will form the electoral college.
These electors then meet in December to cast votes – called electoral votes – for the presidenti­al and vice-presidenti­al candidates who receive the most votes from their state.
States are allocated a number of electoral votes based on their representa­tion in Congress. The candidate who gets at least 270 of the 538 electoral votes wins the presidenti­al election.
Forty-eight states and Washington, DC have a winner-takes-all system, where the candidate who receives the most votes gets all of that state’s electoral votes. Maine and Nebraska have a more proportion­al system of distributi­ng their votes.
This voting system was the result of a historical compromise between letting Congress elect the president and letting the people elect the president.
The electoral college gives smaller states, which are better represente­d in Congress relative to their population size, a bigger influence in presidenti­al elections than they would have in a popular vote.
However, this also means that a candidate may lose the popular vote and still become the president if he wins the electoral college.
This has happened five times since the popular vote was first recorded in 1824: thrice in the 1800s, President George W. Bush in 2000, and President Donald Trump in 2016. Q What happens if no candidate wins the majority of electoral votes? A The House of Representa­tives chooses the new president from the top three candidates.
Each of the 50 states gets one vote and the candidate who wins at least 26 state votes becomes president. The Senate elects the vicepresid­ent from the two remaining candidates, with each of the 100 senators getting a vote.
This is extremely rare. Only twice in US history did the House of Representa­tives elect the president: in 1800 and in 1824. Q A Who runs the polls? State and local officials conduct federal elections in their state. The specific details vary widely from state to state.
The Federal Election Commission (FEC) does not run the elections, but regulates how campaigns are financed. The six-member commission is in charge of implementi­ng and enforcing how candidates raise and spend their money, and makes sure they disclose their campaign finances according to law.
Members of the FEC are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.
No more than three can be from the same political party – to avoid partisansh­ip – and the chairman- ship rotates between members.
But at least four commission­ers are required for any action to be taken. This quorum has not been met since last month, leaving the FEC unable to take action. mine the victor, says Brookings Institutio­n senior fellow for governance studies Elaine Kamarck.
“When exit polls show a clear and statistica­lly significan­t advantage for one candidate or the other, the networks have been able to call the state as soon as the polls close.
“Given that there are deep red (Republican) and deep blue (Democratic) states, many states are called right away,” she says.
The early winner may also not be the final victor. In 2016, early prediction­s gave Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton a high chance could take days, or even weeks, to be finalised.
Because of the pandemic, more people are likely to vote by mail, which takes longer to count. In some states, mail ballots that arrive after Election Day can also be counted, as long as they are postmarked by the state’s deadline.
This delay will be especially significan­t in hotly contested states, where margins may be narrow enough that media organisati­ons cannot call the result. of victory, but this shrank over the course of the night as races in some key states were unexpected­ly too close to call. By 11pm, Mr Trump had won the crucial battlegrou­nd states of Ohio and Florida. The presidenti­al election was called for Mr Trump around 2.30am, after he won Wisconsin. Q A What happens on Election Night? Polls close from between 6pm and 9pm local time, although voters are allowed to cast their ballot as long as they are in line by the time polling places close.
Typically, media organisati­ons use exit poll data, sample counts and statistica­l modelling to deter- Q Will the results be known on Election Night? If not, what happens?
