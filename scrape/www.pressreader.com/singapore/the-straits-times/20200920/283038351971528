    <p>Coro­n­avirus pan­demic or not, for peo­ple who want to ac­cel­er­ate learn­ing about new sub­jects, strengthen ca­reer prospects or meet so­cial goals, net­work­ing is at the heart of find­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and ex­plor­ing them.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, while team meet­ings and in­dus­try con­ven­tions have moved on­line, the new normal has opened as many doors as it has closed.</p>
    <p>EX­PAND YOUR NET­WORK</p>
    <p>Peo­ple you reach out to may be more open to con­nect­ing now be­cause they are no longer com­mut­ing or tak­ing busi­ness trips, and have more time to talk.</p>
    <p>If the peo­ple al­ready in your net­work are much like you in their ed­u­ca­tion, race, ge­og­ra­phy and in­dus­try, fo­cus on di­ver­si­fy­ing, said Ms Amy Waninger, au­thor of Net­work Be­yond Bias. Women, for ex­am­ple, may want men at their con­fer­ences to hear about the prob­lems they are fac­ing, “not to tell us what to do”, she said, but so they can help fix the of­fice en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>You could also di­ver­sify your net­work by aim­ing for more “cog­ni­tive fric­tion” – con­nect­ing with peo­ple who have dif­fer­ent ways of ap­proach­ing prob­lems and get­ting things done or have dif­fer­ent pri­or­i­ties or val­ues.</p>
    <p>GO BE­YOND GE­OG­RA­PHY</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has lev­elled the play­ing field in some ways, ac­cord­ing to Ms Tiana Clark, who has worked as an in­tel­li­gence an­a­lyst in the US air force, a pub­lic school teacher and now in Chicago as a sales di­rec­tor for Mi­crosoft.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple aren’t bound by lo­ca­tion, per­sonal obli­ga­tions or fi­nan­cial cir­cum­stance that had pre­vented them from be­ing able to at­tend con­fer­ences or join af­ter-work events.</p>
    <p>Net­work­ing from home can even of­fer higher-qual­ity in­ter­ac­tions, she said, be­cause “you are reach­ing out to some­one in­ten­tion­ally, some­one you’ve done a lit­tle re­search on in ad­vance, not just strik­ing up a con­ver­sa­tion with who­ever you run into at a con­fer­ence”.</p>
    <p>There are a plethora of pro­fes­sional and in­ter­est-based or­gan­i­sa­tions on­line to join.</p>
    <p>Ms Mi­randa Kali­nowski, head of global re­cruit­ing for Face­book, rec­om­mends Fairy God­boss and Power To Fly, which con­nect women with job open­ings and ca­reer ad­vice, and Stack Over­flow for soft­ware de­vel­op­ers to learn and share pro­gram­ming knowl­edge, and check out job open­ings.</p>
    <p>LinkedIn has suggestion­s for groups and news­let­ters that might be of in­ter­est based on your pro­file and re­cently be­gan dis­play­ing suggestion­s of “Black voices to fol­low and am­plify” in the app’s My Net­work page.</p>
    <p>Also, many col­leges have lo­cal alumni clubs now hold­ing on­line mee­tups and lec­tures.</p>
    <p>INTRODUCTI­ONS</p>
    <p>The eas­i­est and best way to meet some­one is for a mu­tual con­nec­tion to give you a warm in­tro­duc­tion and high­light what you have in com­mon with the other per­son.</p>
    <p>If you do need to reach out to some­one you’ve never met, Ms Kali­nowski rec­om­mends that you en­gage that per­son through some con­tent, like a blog post that he or she has writ­ten, to start a con­ver­sa­tion, rather than just show­ing up with a re­quest.</p>
    <p>When you do ask for some­thing, for ex­am­ple in­for­ma­tion about a per­son’s job or in­dus­try, do some re­search on the topic and ask for the per­son’s opin­ion on what you’ve learnt, rather than ask­ing him or her to ex­plain it all to you.</p>
    <p>And, of course, don’t ask for in­for­ma­tion that is read­ily avail­able on the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>FIRST ON­LINE IM­PRES­SIONS COUNT The way you present your­self can make the dif­fer­ence be­tween get­ting a re­sponse and be­ing ig­nored, Ms Clark said, so when she con­tacts some­one new, she sends what she calls a “brand nar­ra­tive”, a ones­lide sum­mary of who she is, her back­ground, per­sonal at­tributes and her proud­est achieve­ments.</p>
    <p>It’s a quicker and more holis­tic view than a re­sume that fo­cuses mainly on ca­reer, she said. The goal is to share what you are proud of and “in­spire the per­son to want to meet with you and get to know you bet­ter”, she said. In­clud­ing more as­pects of your­self makes it more likely you will find some­thing in com­mon with the other per­son.</p>
    <p>BE­YOND ONE-ON-ONE IN­TER­AC­TIONS</p>
    <p>Men­tors don’t have to be peo­ple you meet in­di­vid­u­ally. “You can choose your men­tor across time and space through a book or a pod­cast”, and adapt that per­son’s ad­vice and out­look to your own cir­cum­stances, Ms Waninger said.</p>
    <p>GO AHEAD NOW</p>
    <p>Start per­haps with a goal of reach­ing out to one new per­son each week, even if you feel sat­is­fied with your ex­ist­ing con­tacts. In fact, the time to in­vest in your net­work is when you least need it, so by the time you do re­quire as­sis­tance, you have cre­ated a strong sup­port sys­tem. “It’s like build­ing up your credit score so when you need a loan, you’ll be able to get one,” Ms Waninger said.</p>
    <p>Even those who are well-es­tab­lished in their fields should take stock. Net­works can grow stale, Ms Kali­nowski said, and a “fresh take” can be in­vig­o­rat­ing.</p>
