    <p>MUNICH • For­mer Wire­card chief ex­ec­u­tive Markus Braun and two other for­mer com­pany of­fi­cials have been ar­rested, with pros­e­cu­tors say­ing the com­pany knew about huge losses as early as 2015.</p>
    <p>The trio con­spired to ob­tain about €3.2 bil­lion (S$5.1 bil­lion) in fraud­u­lent loans, Munich pros­e­cu­tors said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Com­pany of­fi­cials al­legedly de­cided to in­flate the books with fake as­sets to make Wire­card ap­pear more at­trac­tive to in­vestors, clients and lenders.</p>
    <p>“The sus­pects knew at least by the end of 2015 that the Wire­card</p>
    <p>Group was los­ing money,” pros­e­cu­tors said. “De­ceived by faked ac­counts, banks in Ger­many and Ja­pan, as well as other in­vestors, granted funds of about €3.2 bil­lion, which are now most likely lost.”</p>
    <p>Wire­card filed for bank­ruptcy in June, af­ter ac­knowl­edg­ing that €1.9 bil­lion it had listed as as­sets prob­a­bly did not ex­ist, deep­en­ing its ac­count­ing woes.</p>
    <p>The com­pany ad­mit­ted that pre­vi­ous de­scrip­tions of its busi­ness with third par­ties, which pro­cessed trans­ac­tions on Wire­card’s be­half, were “not cor­rect” af­ter pulling its fi­nan­cial re­sults for last year and the first quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>Wire­card de­clined to com­ment be­fore the pros­e­cu­tors’ an­nounce­ment. Mr Braun’s lawyer, Mr Al­fred Dier­lamm, did not re­ply to calls and an e-mail seek­ing com­ment.</p>
    <p>The other two sus­pects de­tained on Wed­nes­day are for­mer chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Burkhard Ley and Mr Stephan Frei­herr von Erffa.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors iden­ti­fied them as “sus­pect L, CFO un­til the end of 2017” and “sus­pect E, the for­mer head of ac­count­ing”.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg was un­able to lo­cate lawyers for Mr Ley and Mr von Erffa.</p>
    <p>All three are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for fraud, breach of trust, forg­ing ac­counts and mar­ket ma­nip­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>A Munich court on Wed­nes­day ruled that they had to stay in cus­tody, ac­cord­ing to the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Shares of the firm, which were worth more than Deutsche Bank’s only a few months ago, fell as much as 5.2 per cent be­fore re­cov­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s ar­rests are not the first in the case and will likely not be the last.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors openly lob­bied at a press con­fer­ence for wit­nesses to come for­ward, point­ing out that sus­pects who co­op­er­ate are el­i­gi­ble for “con­sid­er­able le­niency”.</p>
    <p>“But it’s also true that the value of any in­for­ma­tion con­tin­ues to drop as our in­ves­ti­ga­tions pro­ceed,” pros­e­cu­tor Anne Lei­d­ing said.</p>
    <p>The ag­gres­sive ap­proach is in sharp con­trast to how pros­e­cu­tors treated Wire­card be­fore it owned up to its ac­count­ing prob­lems.</p>
    <p>In pre­vi­ous years, pros­e­cu­tors said that they would in­ves­ti­gate short-sell­ers and even the me­dia in the face of neg­a­tive re­ports about the com­pany’s fi­nances.</p>
    <p>“In our ques­tion­ing, we learnt that there was a strict hi­er­ar­chi­cal sys­tem, char­ac­terised by an es­prit de corps and pledges of al­le­giance to the then CEO,” Ms Lei­d­ing said.</p>
    <p>Mr Braun had al­ready been de­tained last month, but was re­leased on bail a day later.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, in­ves­ti­ga­tors ar­rested Mr Oliver Bel­len­haus, for­mer man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of a Dubaibased Wire­card unit, who is co­op­er­at­ing with the case.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors on Wed­nes­day said their new find­ings and the ar­rests were based in part on in­for­ma­tion pro­vided by a “crown wit­ness”.</p>
    <p>For­mer chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Jan Marsalek, who was fired last month af­ter Wire­card dis­closed about four-fifths of its net cash was miss­ing from its bal­ance sheet, is still at large.</p>
