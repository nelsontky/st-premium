    <p>More than 1,300 work­ers from Kep­pel Ship­yard and North­point City were tested af­ter the sites emerged as work­place clus­ters, and two pos­i­tive cases were un­cov­ered through these swab oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>This was in ad­di­tion to six cases who were tested af­ter be­ing placed in quar­an­tine as they were close con­tacts of con­firmed cases.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) has been step­ping up its sur­veil­lance, ac­tive case find­ing and con­tain­ment ef­forts in or­der to de­tect and ring-fence cases of in­fec­tion as early as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>This comes as un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity con­tinue to be un­cov­ered, al­though the preva­lence re­mains low at three cases in the past week de­spite test­ing cri­te­ria be­ing ex­panded to in­clude all in­di­vid­u­als aged 13 and above with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Swab oper­a­tions have also been con­ducted to test in­di­vid­u­als at re­tail premises fre­quented by mul­ti­ple pos­i­tive cases, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Close to 60 Sheng Siong su­per­mar­ket staff at New World Cen­tre and more than 40 em­ploy­ees at Han­iffa su­per­mar­ket in Dun­lop Street were tested, and none of the work­ers tested pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Fifty-eight house­holds at Block 111 Tampines Street 11 were also placed un­der phone sur­veil­lance and tested for Covid-19, along with their vis­i­tors, as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure af­ter con­firmed cases were found in two house­holds in the block late last month.</p>
    <p>No new cases have been de­tected so far at Block 111, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan said that when in­fec­tion clus­ters arise, the min­istry takes swift ac­tion to quar­an­tine and test close con­tacts and carry out swab oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“We are now on a good foot­ing, but this can eas­ily change if there is a big clus­ter which may spawn sec­ond or third gen­er­a­tions of in­fec­tion. This is why MOH has been ac­tively iden­ti­fy­ing high-risk set­tings to ag­gres­sively test and con­tact trace cases,” said Mr Gan, who co-chairs a multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Cou­pled with sur­veil­lance, this would give us an early sense of emerg­ing cases. When we de­tect cases, we have taken steps to draw large rings around them, to iso­late con­tacts quickly and pre­vent fur­ther transmissi­on,” he added.</p>
    <p>Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the task force, said that each time there is a case, con­tact trac­ing is car­ried out. If there are sus­pected or con­firmed cases be­yond the first case, a wide net is cast around the peo­ple who might have been to the same place or worked there.</p>
    <p>“We will do an ac­tive swab­bing op­er­a­tion... We might swab ev­ery­one. We might even close the venue,” said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>MOH said it has been us­ing a com­bi­na­tion of dif­fer­ent test­ing meth­ods to pick up early sig­nals of emerg­ing clus­ters.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency’s (NEA) waste­water test­ing al­lows mon­i­tor­ing of the sit­u­a­tion in densely pop­u­lated res­i­den­tial premises, it said. This waste­water sur­veil­lance is cur­rently i mple­mented at 34 dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>“NEA has started to trial waste­water mon­i­tor­ing in other set­tings, and is plan­ning to pro­gres­sively ex­pand such sur­veil­lance to in­clude more work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries and other pop­u­lous liv­ing quar­ters such as nurs­ing homes and hos­tels,” added the min­istry.</p>
