    <p>NEW YORK • Ja­pan’s Naomi Osaka with­drew from the Western and South­ern Open fi­nal due to a ham­string in­jury yes­ter­day, putting her par­tic­i­pa­tion at the US Open, which starts to­mor­row, in doubt.</p>
    <p>The world No. 10’s with­drawal meant Vic­to­ria Azarenka of Be­larus took the event by walkover, her first sin­gles ti­tle in over four years since win­ning in Mi­ami.</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry to have to with­draw to­day with an in­jury,” said Osaka, who is still sched­uled to fea­ture at Flush­ing Mead­ows, where she is due to play fel­low Ja­panese Misaki Doi in the first round.</p>
    <p>“I pulled my left ham­string yes­ter­day in the se­cond-set tiebreak and it has not re­cov­ered overnight as I had hoped.”</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old had de­feated Bel­gium’s Elise Mertens in the semi-fi­nals to set up the cham­pi­onship match against two-time Aus­tralian Open win­ner and world No. 59 Azarenka in the same New York Covid-19 “bub­ble” where the US Open will be held.</p>
    <p>Her semi-fi­nal was de­layed by a day af­ter she echoed a move by Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion teams by opt­ing not to play the play-offs in protest against the po­lice shoot­ing of African-Amer­i­can Ja­cob Blake in Kenosha, Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>Her de­ci­sion prompted the WTA and ATP Tours to push back all four semi-fi­nals to Friday, lead­ing Osaka to re­verse her de­ci­sion to sit out.</p>
    <p>“This has been an emo­tional week and I want to thank every­one for the out­pour­ing of sup­port,” said the two-time Grand Slam win­ner on Friday.</p>
    <p>The in­jury, how­ever, is a big blow as she pre­pared to re­turn to the scene of her first Ma­jor tri­umph, the 2018 US Open vic­tory over 23-time Grand Slam cham­pion Ser­ena Wil­liams.</p>
    <p>The Western and South­ern Open was Osaka’s first com­pet­i­tive ap­pear­ance since the WTA re­sumed af­ter a four-month plus coro­n­avirus-en­forced shut­down that started in March, prompt­ing the can­cel­la­tion of Wim­ble­don and the post­pone­ment of the French Open to late next month.</p>
    <p>APOLO­GIES</p>
    <p>I’m sorry to have to with­draw to­day with an in­jury. I pulled my left ham­string yes­ter­day in the se­cond-set tiebreak and it has not re­cov­ered overnight as I had hoped. ’’</p>
    <p>NAOMI OSAKA, world No. 10, on pulling out of the Western and South­ern Open fi­nal.</p>
