    <p>A Tai­wanese wo­man who pur­posely sneezed at a se­cu­rity guard af­ter she was de­nied en­try into a mall amid the Covid-19 out­break in April, was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to 11 weeks in jail.</p>
    <p>Af­ter sneez­ing at the guard at Ion Or­chard, Sun Szu-Yen, 46, said: “You get it? You get it al­ready!”</p>
    <p>She then took her pass­port out of her bag and added: “I am China. I am Tai­wan.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, District Judge Seah Chi-Ling said Sun was found to be un­suit­able for sen­tenc­ing that would have kept her out of jail.</p>
    <p>Sun, who was in Singapore on a long-term pass, had pleaded guilty in June to one count of per­form­ing a rash act and an un­re­lated ha­rass­ment charge.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Sun ad­mit­ted to the of­fences, the judge called for her to be as­sessed for a manda­tory treat­ment or­der, where of­fend­ers re­ceive treat­ment for their men­tal con­di­tion in lieu of jail time.</p>
    <p>But she was not found to be suf­fer­ing from any men­tal ill­ness.</p>
    <p>The sneez­ing in­ci­dent hap­pened on April 12. The court heard that se­cu­rity guard De­vika Rani Muthu Kr­ish­nan, 56, was de­ployed to one of the en­trances of Ion Or­chard at a lift lobby on the fifth storey of the mall.</p>
    <p>Her du­ties in­cluded en­sur­ing that shop­pers’ par­tic­u­lars were recorded on a form for con­tact trac­ing, and that they wore masks be­fore en­ter­ing the mall.</p>
    <p>Sun, who was not wear­ing a mask, ar­rived at around 12.40pm and filled out a form.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Deb­o­rah Lee had ear­lier said: “The vic­tim re­minded the ac­cused to wear a mask be­fore en­ter­ing the mall. How­ever, the ac­cused used her scarf to wrap around her mouth in­stead.</p>
    <p>“When the vic­tim did not al­low the ac­cused en­try into the mall, the ac­cused pulled another scarf out of her bag and in­di­cated that she wanted to use it as a mask.”</p>
    <p>Sun then sneezed in Ms De­vika Rani’s di­rec­tion when the se­cu­rity guard re­fused to let her pass.</p>
    <p>Separately, the court heard that at around 10pm on June 4 last year, Sun felt “stressed and frus­trated” while at home in her third-storey con­do­minium unit near Bukit Timah Road. No rea­son was men­tioned for what caused her to feel that way.</p>
    <p>To vent her frus­tra­tion, she picked up sev­eral items, in­clud­ing a vac­uum cleaner and a glass bot­tle, and flung them out of a win­dow. A se­cu­rity guard at the prop­erty alerted the po­lice af­ter she re­fused to calm down.</p>
