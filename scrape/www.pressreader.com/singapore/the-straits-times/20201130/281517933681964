    <p>The res­i­den­tial prop­erty mar­ket has proven to be one of the few re­ces­sion-proof sec­tors amid a pan­demic that has plunged the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy into its worst-ever con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say this is due in large part to a slew of cool­ing mea­sures to curb spec­u­la­tion and en­sure that home buy­ers do not over­lever­age, cou­pled with mas­sive gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus to save jobs and prop up the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>This is borne out by con­tin­ued growth, both in the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity’s pri­vate home price in­dex and the Hous­ing Board (HDB) re­sale price in­dex.</p>
    <p>The pri­vate home price in­dex grew 0.1 per cent in the first nine months of this year com­pared with 2.1 per cent growth last year, and mi­nus 5.2 per cent dur­ing the 2009 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>With the econ­omy bot­tom­ing out, prices should sta­bilise in the near term, with a flat to 1 per cent growth seen for this year, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>This is un­like the situation in 2009 when the pri­vate home price in­dex plunged nearly 25 per cent from the sec­ond quar­ter in 2008 to the sec­ond quar­ter in 2009.</p>
    <p>Back then, the prop­erty bub­ble burst af­ter it was fed by loose mone­tary con­di­tions and ram­pant spec­u­la­tion in the years be­fore the cri­sis, noted Ms Tri­cia Song, Col­liers In­ter­na­tional’s Sin­ga­pore re­search head.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the HDB re­sale price in­dex has had six straight years of de­cline, but is poised to defy the pan­demic and post the strong­est an­nual growth since 2012.</p>
    <p>HDB re­sale prices jumped 1.8 per cent in the first three quar­ters of this year – a turn­around from the price drop of 0.4 per cent in the same pe­riod a year ago.</p>
    <p>With de­mand ex­pected to stay ro­bust, HDB re­sale prices could grow by 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent this year, said Ms Wong Siew Ying, PropNex’s head of re­search and con­tent.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say a slew of HDB pol­icy changes rolled out in the past two years are tak­ing ef­fect, and newer re­sale flats in Daw­son and</p>
    <p>Tiong Bahru that have reached the min­i­mum oc­cu­pa­tion pe­riod are be­ing sold at higher prices.</p>
    <p>More of these newer flats have also been sold. Around 27 per cent of flats sold in the first nine months of this year had a lease of 90 years or more, up from 19 per cent in the same pe­riod last year, Ms Wong noted.</p>
    <p>Ms Song said a big boost also came from the Gov­ern­ment dish­ing out close to $100 bil­lion over four stim­u­lus pack­ages this year, in­clud­ing the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, as well as leg­is­lat­ing tem­po­rary mea­sures on mora­to­ri­ums or waivers on com­mer­cial rents, home mort­gages and in­ter­est pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong added that prop­erty curbs – in­clud­ing the to­tal debt ser­vic­ing ra­tio rules, ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty and lower loanto-value lim­its – that were im­posed in re­cent years had also put the prop­erty mar­ket on a more sta­ble foot­ing ahead of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun, OrangeTee & Tie’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy, said the HDB re­sale mar­ket got a lift from pol­icy changes.</p>
    <p>These in­clude al­low­ing buy­ers greater flex­i­bil­ity in us­ing their Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund monies to buy older flats, en­hanc­ing the CPF Hous­ing Grant, rais­ing in­come ceil­ings and al­low­ing larger home loans for el­i­gi­ble buy­ers.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures helped boost HDB re­sales to 7,787 units in the third quar­ter of this year – the high­est quar­terly sales since the third quar­ter of 2010 when 8,205 units were trans­acted, Ms Sun added.</p>
    <p>Ms Song noted: “HDB prices now look rel­a­tively at­trac­tive af­ter hav­ing fallen 12.4 per cent from 2013 to 2019, com­pared with the pri­vate home price in­dex, which fell 2.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Now that HDB re­sale prices have ad­justed, it could start to track the pri­vate home price in­dex and the gen­eral house­hold in­come growth.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sun said HDB re­sale prices out­pac­ing pri­vate home prices by such a large mag­ni­tude is an ex­cep­tion rather than the norm.</p>
    <p>PropNex said HDB re­sale prices and trans­ac­tion vol­umes are also fu­elled by fac­tors such as de­mand be­ing di­verted from the Build-To­Order mar­ket due to pan­demic-re­lated de­lays in con­struc­tion and com­ple­tion of new flats.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said a new hous­ing grant of up to $160,000 for first­time buy­ers of HDB re­sale flats also helped push up sales.</p>
    <p>“Amid a dreary eco­nomic out­look, some buy­ers also went for more af­ford­able op­tions in HDB re­sale,” she added.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect the sales mo­men­tum to con­tinue in the fourth quar­ter, with to­tal HDB re­sale vol­umes hit­ting above 23,000 this year. But it is not likely to test the 2012 high when re­sale vol­umes crossed 25,000.”</p>
