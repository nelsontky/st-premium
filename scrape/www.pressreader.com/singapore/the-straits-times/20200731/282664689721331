    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Mrs Michelle Obama’s epony­mous Spo­tify pod­cast, The Michelle Obama Pod­cast, is fi­nally here. And her first guest is none other than her hus­band of 28 years, for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama, re­ports Harper’s Bazaar.</p>
    <p>Launched on Wednes­day, the pod­cast will ex­am­ine the re­la­tion­ships that have shaped the lives of guests, which in­clude busi­ness­woman Va­lerie Jar­rett, who talks about men­tor­ship, and tele­vi­sion host Co­nan O’Brien in a dis­cus­sion on mar­riage.</p>
    <p>In the first episode, the for­mer first cou­ple look at the bonds they have forged with their re­spec­tive com­mu­ni­ties, which they say were in­te­gral to both their up­bring­ing and their ca­reers long be­fore their tenures in the White House.</p>
    <p>Mrs Obama, 56, re­flects on her up­bring­ing in Chicago’s South Shore com­mu­nity, which has a strong sense of com­mu­nity spirit. Re­call­ing neigh­bours sup­port­ing one an­other, she says that it shaped her into some­one who looks out for oth­ers. That em­pha­sis on com­mu­nity is some­thing she sees in her hus­band too.</p>
    <p>“You know the core of ev­ery­thing you have done po­lit­i­cally, what I know about you as a per­son and one of the rea­sons why I fell in love with you is...,” she says, be­fore be­ing in­ter­rupted by Mr Obama.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t just my looks. But that’s okay,” the 58-year-old jokes.</p>
    <p>“You’re cute, you know,” she con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>“But, no. One of the rea­sons I fell in love with you is be­cause you are guided by the prin­ci­ple that we are each other’s brothers’ and sis­ters’ keep­ers. And that’s how I was raised.”</p>
    <p>In 1985, two years after he grad­u­ated from Columbia Univer­sity, Mr Obama be­gan work­ing as a com­mu­nity or­gan­iser in Chicago, set­ting up a job train­ing pro­gramme, a col­lege prepara­tory tu­tor­ing pro­gramme, as well as es­tab­lish­ing a ten­ants’ rights or­gan­i­sa­tion in Alt­geld Gar­dens.</p>
    <p>The two met four years later, in 1989, when he was in­tern­ing at a Chicago law firm where she was an as­so­ciate. The cou­ple tied the knot three years later in 1992.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on their shared val­ues, Mrs Obama says: “I can say that my fam­ily, my neigh­bour­hood, my no­tions of com­mu­nity grow­ing up shaped that view, and shaped the choices that I made in life as I felt your ex­pe­ri­ences shape yours.”</p>
    <p>In their usual fash­ion, the cou­ple, in be­tween charm­ing ban­ter, easy laugh­ter and quick “love yous”, also dis­cuss fam­ily life, giv­ing lis­ten­ers a glimpse into the con­ver­sa­tions they have around the din­ner ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on the legacy they hoped to leave for their daugh­ters, Malia and Sasha, Mr Obama says: “When you and I think about what’s the in­her­i­tance we’d like to leave Malia and Sasha, more than any­thing that it would be is that they’re liv­ing in a coun­try that re­spects ev­ery­body and looks after ev­ery­body; cel­e­brates and sees ev­ery­body. ‘Cause we know that if we’re not around, that those girls are in a so­ci­ety like that, they’ll be fine.”</p>
