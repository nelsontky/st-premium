    <p>AT­LANTA/NEW YORK • The US re­ported more than 1,000 coro­n­avirus deaths on Tues­day, mark­ing the first time since June 10 that the na­tion has sur­passed that grim mile­stone, as Cal­i­for­nia closed in on pass­ing New York in the num­ber of to­tal in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Around 145,000 Amer­i­cans have now died from Covid-19, a toll that experts warn will likely surge fol­low­ing re­cent record spikes in case num­bers and an alarm­ing rise in hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions in many states.</p>
    <p>But in some states, gov­er­nors and lo­cal of­fi­cials are con­tin­u­ing to bicker over the best way to re­spond to the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In Texas, Gov­er­nor Greg Ab­bott said Hi­dalgo county could not or­der res­i­dents to stay home and that mask and so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules were suf­fi­cient to keep busi­nesses open in the Rio Grande Val­ley, on the US bor­der with Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>In Ge­or­gia, Gov­er­nor Brian Kemp has sought to pre­vent At­lanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bot­toms from en­forc­ing an or­der for res­i­dents to wear masks in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>In Florida, the state teach­ers’ union has sued Gov­er­nor Ron DeSan­tis and other of­fi­cials to try to halt his plans to re­open schools as the state saw more than 10,000 daily new coro­n­avirus cases for six out of the past seven days.</p>
    <p>On av­er­age last week, 19 per cent of Florida’s Covid-19 tests came back pos­i­tive, in­di­cat­ing wide­spread com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion. Deaths have climbed 45 per cent week on week.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s much bet­ter to­day than it was two weeks ago. And I think it will con­tinue to im­prove,” Mr DeSan­tis said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther Florida nor Ge­or­gia have is­sued statewide mask man­dates.</p>
    <p>In Texas, Mr Ab­bott ini­tially re­sisted such an or­der but later agreed to re­quire face cov­er­ings in most coun­ties. In Hi­dalgo county, cases have risen 59 per cent in the past week to to­tal nearly 13,000. In just one week, deaths have dou­bled to more than 300.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia on Tues­day be­came the sec­ond US state after New York to re­port more than 400,000 Covid-19 cases. It has seen over 7,800 deaths.</p>
    <p>New York has recorded by far the most deaths of any US state at more than 32,000. But it now has one of the na­tion’s low­est in­fec­tion rates and re­ported just two coro­n­avirus­re­lated deaths on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Data re­leased by the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) on Tues­day showed that the num­ber of in­fected peo­ple in dif­fer­ent parts of the United States was two to 13 times higher than re­ported rates.</p>
    <p>The find­ings sug­gest that large num­bers of peo­ple who did not have symp­toms or did not seek med­i­cal care may have kept the virus cir­cu­lat­ing in their com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The study in­di­cates that even the hard­est-hit area – New York City, where one in four peo­ple has been ex­posed to the virus – is nowhere near achiev­ing herd im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Experts be­lieve 60 per cent of peo­ple in an area would need to have been ex­posed to at­tain herd im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The anal­y­sis, based on an­ti­body tests, is the largest of its kind.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese data con­tinue to show that the num­ber of peo­ple who have been in­fected with the virus that causes Covid-19 far exceeds the num­ber of re­ported cases,” said Dr Fiona Havers, the CDC re­searcher who led the study.</p>
    <p>“Many of th­ese peo­ple likely had no symp­toms or mild ill­ness and may have had no idea that they were in­fected.”</p>
    <p>The US now tests about 700,000 peo­ple a day. The new re­sults high­light the need for much more test­ing to de­tect in­fec­tion lev­els and con­tain the vi­ral spread in var­i­ous parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Dr Havers stressed that even those who do not know their in­fec­tion sta­tus should wear cloth face cov­er­ings, prac­tise so­cial dis­tanc­ing and wash their hands fre­quently.</p>
