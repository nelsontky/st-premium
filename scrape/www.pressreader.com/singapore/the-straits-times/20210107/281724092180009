    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES Cal­i­for­nia, the most pop­u­lous US state, has been hit par­tic­u­larly hard by the lat­est coro­n­avirus surge, and some of­fi­cials are pin­ning the blame on Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day gath­er­ings in Novem­ber and peo­ple’s com­pla­cency due to the re­cent vac­cine roll-out.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia’s daily coro­n­avirus case tal­lies re­main around four times what they were dur­ing the state’s sum­mer surge, and of­fi­cials pre­dict that the af­ter-ef­fects of a De­cem­ber surge linked to hol­i­day gath­er­ings will worsen as the win­ter drags on.</p>
    <p>Af­ter new in­fec­tions – driven by Thanks­giv­ing travel and gath­er­ings, then Christ­mas fes­tiv­i­ties – re­sulted in a surge un­like any the state had seen, the tra­jec­tory of its new cases has lev­elled off some­what in the early days of this year.</p>
    <p>But there are more than twice as many Covid-19 pa­tients in Cal­i­for­nia hos­pi­tals now – at over 20,000 – as there were a month ago, and many in­ten­sive care units in the state are over­flow­ing.</p>
    <p>At least six peo­ple in the state have also been found to be in­fected with the new, more trans­mis­si­ble vari­ant of the virus, which was first iden­ti­fied in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials in Los An­ge­les county have told first re­spon­ders to stop bring­ing adult pa­tients who can­not be re­sus­ci­tated to hos­pi­tals, cit­ing a short­age of beds and staff.</p>
    <p>The or­der, is­sued late on Mon­day and ef­fec­tive im­me­di­ately, marked an es­ca­la­tion of mea­sures be­ing taken by state and lo­cal of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les Mayor Eric Garcetti said on Sun­day that the county’s lat­est surge was in­fect­ing a new per­son ev­ery six sec­onds, and that many trans­mis­sions were oc­cur­ring in pri­vate set­tings.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on CBS pro­gramme Face The Na­tion, Mr Garcetti said the dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines “has made ev­ery­body so hope­ful that they can re­lax their be­hav­iour”.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple who are younger or don’t have pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions have be­come very com­fort­able. This is a virus that preys off of our weak­ness, preys off of our ex­haus­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>Los An­ge­les was among the first coun­ties in the United States to in­tro­duce so­cial dis­tanc­ing curbs af­ter re­port­ing its first Covid-19 death on March 11. In the same month, it sus­pended church mass, or­dered the clo­sure of bars, gyms, and en­ter­tain­ment cen­tres, and re­stricted restau­rants to just take­out or delivery ser­vice.</p>
    <p>On March 19, Cal­i­for­nia Gover­nor Gavin New­som is­sued a statewide “stay at home” or­der.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses were grad­u­ally al­lowed to open in May, but in­fec­tions soon started to creep up and on Nov 17, Cal­i­for­nia is­sued a manda­tory mask wear­ing or­der.</p>
    <p>“We’ve done ev­ery­thing right.</p>
    <p>But this virus doesn’t care what you’ve done in the past, only what you’re do­ing to­day,” said Mr Garcetti.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia re­ported 31,440 new Covid-19 cases on Tues­day and a to­tal statewide tally of over 2.4 mil­lion. More than 27,000 peo­ple have died of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Across the US, some 20.7 mil­lion peo­ple have been in­fected with the virus since March, and the death toll stands at over 352,000, ac­cord­ing to the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion.</p>
    <p>A record 129,000 Covid-19 pa­tients were in hos­pi­tals as at Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The wors­en­ing sit­u­a­tion has ramped up pres­sure on state and lo­cal of­fi­cials to speed up dis­tri­bu­tion of the two coro­n­avirus vac­cines so far ap­proved for emer­gency use.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral health of­fi­cials said on Mon­day that more than two-thirds of the 15 mil­lion coro­n­avirus vac­cines man­u­fac­tured by Pfizer and Moderna, and shipped within the US, have yet to be ad­min­is­tered.</p>
