    <p>There were five im­ported cases, com­pris­ing one permanent res­i­dent, one work pass holder, one work per­mit holder and two short-term visit pass hold­ers. Of these, four re­turned from In­dia and one from the United States.</p>
    <p>Queensway Shop­ping Cen­tre, Wa­ter­way Point, West Mall and the Shake Shack out­let at Liat Tow­ers were among places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There were four vis­its recorded at the Any­time Fit­ness gym at Queensway Shop­ping Cen­tre be­tween Sept 3 and 8, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The 4Fingers Crispy Chicken out­let at Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 3 was also added to the list.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited them to get those who were also at these places dur­ing the spec­i­fied pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>MOH also con­firmed 48 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,454.</p>
    <p>There were five im­ported cases, com­pris­ing one permanent res­i­dent, one work pass holder, one work per­mit holder and two short­term visit pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Of these, four re­turned from In­dia and one from the United States.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases had been placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said MOH.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 43 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among these, 29 were iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 14 cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance testing, such as ros­tered rou­tine testing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries ev­ery fort­night.</p>
    <p>MOH also an­nounced two new clus­ters in dor­mi­to­ries – in Jurong Pen­juru Dor­mi­tory 1 at 58 Pen­juru Place and Jurong Pen­juru Dor­mi­tory 2 at 36 Pen­juru Place.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from two cases two weeks ago to one in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from a daily av­er­age of two cases to one over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 38 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 56,787 have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 53 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 572 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>None is in in­ten­sive care. Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
