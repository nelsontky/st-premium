    <p>She may be un­lucky in love, but Chi­nese in­flu­encer Grace Chow can count her lucky stars in other ways.</p>
    <p>Chow, who turned 32 last Satur­day, caught the at­ten­tion of ne­ti­zens when she posted on so­cial me­dia a photo of her­self in a lux­ury home and wrote: “I have re­ceived the most im­por­tant gift in my life.”</p>
    <p>“Mum said my father told the con­trac­tors they have to com­plete the ren­o­va­tion by Sept 12 as that day is his daugh­ter’s birth­day,” she added.</p>
    <p>She added a photo of her­self at a cinema and wrote: “Dad knows that I like starry night, so he in­stalled a starry night-themed the­atre for me.”</p>
    <p>The pic­tures con­firmed talk that Chow comes from a rich fam­ily. Her father, whose name is not known, is ru­moured to be a Chi­nese mag­nate with a mil­i­tary back­ground.</p>
    <p>When a few ne­ti­zens com­mented that they were en­vi­ous of her father’s love for her, Chow replied:</p>
    <p>“My father is not an ex­pres­sive per­son and sel­dom com­mu­ni­cates with me. He is ‘all ac­tion and no talk’”.</p>
    <p>Chow grabbed head­lines in April when she an­nounced her break-up with Tai­wanese pop star Show Lo, her boyfriend of nine years, with an ex­plo­sive so­cial me­dia post that ac­cused him of be­ing un­faith­ful to her. Lo has been keep­ing a low pro­file since and has had projects in China can­celled.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the apart­ment, Chow also re­ceived other gifts, in­clud­ing about 10 cakes.</p>
    <p>She said a friend, whom she did not name, paid for three gi­ant pho­tos of her to be put up at a depart­ment store in Hara­juku in Tokyo. Chow said her pho­tos can be seen by shop­pers in Hara­juku and Omote­sando.</p>
    <p>She posted pho­tos of birth­day cel­e­bra­tions with her friends, in­clud­ing Ms Lau­rinda Ho, daugh­ter of late Ma­cau casino ty­coon Stan­ley Ho.</p>
