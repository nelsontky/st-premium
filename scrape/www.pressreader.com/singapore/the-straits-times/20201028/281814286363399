    <p>For­mer do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani, who was ac­quit­ted last month of steal­ing from the fam­ily of prom­i­nent busi­ness­man Liew Mun Leong, has de­cided not to ap­proach her for­mer em­ployer for com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>In­stead, she is seek­ing com­pen­sa­tion from the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) un­der a pro­vi­sion that caps the sum at $10,000, the High Court heard yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She made the de­ci­sion de­spite suf­fer­ing losses which her lawyer Anil Balchan­dani quan­ti­fied at $71,000.</p>
    <p>The sum in­cludes her salary for four years and the ex­penses in­curred by non-gov­ern­men­tal group Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nom­ics (Home) in shel­ter­ing her since De­cem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>Mr Balchan­dani told Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn that “a lot has tran­spired” since the judge ac­quit­ted Ms Parti, pri­mar­ily that Mr Liew has re­signed from his posts at the Changi Air­port Group and Sur­bana Jurong.</p>
    <p>“In re­gard to that, my client’s in­struc­tions were not to add more to his prob­lems,” said the lawyer.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code, if an ac­cused per­son is ac­quit­ted, and if it is proven that the pros­e­cu­tion was friv­o­lous or vex­a­tious, the court may or­der the pros­e­cu­tion or the com­plainant to pay up to $10,000 to the ac­cused.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan sug­gested that the par­ties try go­ing for me­di­a­tion, bear­ing in mind the lim­ited sum Ms Parti can claim.</p>
    <p>He noted that pub­lic funds are in­volved and the cost of a two or three-day hear­ing into the le­gal ar­gu­ments, such as what amounts to “friv­o­lous or vex­a­tious”, will come up to more than $10,000.</p>
    <p>“Is it worth it? It doesn’t seem so,” said the judge, who sug­gested get­ting for­mer at­tor­neys-gen­eral as me­di­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Balchan­dani said he un­der­stood that the thresh­old to prove the case is high, but his client was seek­ing “a nom­i­nal amount to show that some­thing went wrong”.</p>
    <p>He added: “The ap­pel­lant, who is now a free per­son, was wronged, and the AGC could be a lit­tle wiser the next time round.”</p>
    <p>Ms Parti was fired on Oct 28, 2016, and a po­lice re­port was made against her two days later. She was ar­rested on Dec 2 when she re­turned to Sin­ga­pore and has stayed at Home’s shel­ter since then.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Jus­tice Chan ques­tioned Mr Balchan­dani on the $71,000 fig­ure, which in­cluded $20 a day for her stay, mak­ing a to­tal of $29,220.</p>
    <p>The judge said the ex­penses in­curred by Home can­not be con­sid­ered a loss to Ms Parti.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan also asked about money that was raised for Ms Parti through crowd­fund­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Balchan­dani said one part of the $28,000 will go to her and another will go to­wards the ex­penses for her stay here.</p>
    <p>The case was ad­journed for par­ties to con­sider me­di­a­tion. If the at­tempt fails, both sides will file their writ­ten sub­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Last week, Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon al­lowed a dis­ci­plinary in­quiry to pro­ceed against the two pros­e­cu­tors who han­dled Ms Parti’s trial.</p>
    <p>Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam is ex­pected to make a min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment next week to ad­dress ques­tions that have been raised about the case.</p>
