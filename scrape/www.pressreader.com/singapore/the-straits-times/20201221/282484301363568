    <p>LON­DON De­clan Rice was heav­ily ru­moured to be the fi­nal piece of the jig­saw to cap Frank Lam­pard’s £200 mil­lion-plus (S$358 mil­lion) over­haul of his Chelsea team in the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>The move failed to ma­te­ri­alise but ac­cord­ing to the Bri­tish me­dia, the Eng­land mid­fielder re­mains top of the Pre­mier League team’s wish list and there is talk of a £70 mil­lion bid when the trans­fer win­dow opens next month.</p>
    <p>Rice will get a fur­ther chance to im­press his suit­ors as Chelsea host West Ham in the top flight to­day, with the 21-year-old re­turn­ing to</p>
    <p>Stam­ford Bridge, where he turned out for the club’s academy be­fore be­ing re­leased as a young­ster.</p>
    <p>The Ham­mers had no hes­i­ta­tion snap­ping him up and he has gone on to be­come not only an ev­er­p­re­sent for David Moyes’ side – he fea­tured in all their 38 league games last sea­son – but also a reg­u­lar starter for Gareth South­gate’s Eng­land team.</p>
    <p>While the Blues are keen on bring­ing him back to west Lon­don, Lam­pard claimed there were no re­grets over the de­ci­sion to let him go in 2014, adding Rice de­served “per­sonal credit” for his im­pres­sive break­through at West Ham.</p>
    <p>The Chelsea man­ager said: “He’s a fan­tas­tic player for West Ham and Eng­land so fair play, be­cause his jour­ney there af­ter leav­ing Chelsea and go­ing to West Ham is a good story to hear.</p>
    <p>“In terms of from our end, I cer­tainly wouldn’t use the word, ‘re­gret’ – our academy is one of the best in the world and you look at our first team now with the play­ers that we have pro­duced who are in and around that squad...</p>
    <p>“It’s not an ex­act science to pick play­ers but the academy staff do bril­liantly here.”</p>
    <p>As a for­mer West Ham academy grad­u­ate who went on to star for the club be­fore mak­ing his big move to Chelsea, this lo­cal derby used to take on greater sig­nif­i­cance for Lam­pard but he is now more con­cerned with ad­dress­ing their mini-slump.</p>
    <p>Chelsea are un­de­feated in their past five Pre­mier League games at home, scor­ing three or more goals in four of them, yet are com­ing off suc­ces­sive league de­feats for the first time since last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>To­day’s op­po­nents also sat in ninth spot be­fore yes­ter­day’s games, just a spot be­low the Blues, and will over­take them with a win.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing his mam­moth trans­fer out­lay, a ti­tle chal­lenge is ex­pected of the hosts but Lam­pard wants to tem­per ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one was talk­ing about us go­ing on a great run and we should win the league,” he said. “Part of my rea­son­ing to dampen that was other teams have prob­a­bly been to­gether longer and built for longer which builds con­fi­dence within the group of play­ers that they can deal with things bet­ter in games.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ism is we are not a Liver­pool of last year or a Manch­ester City of the year be­fore where you can just go out and win, win, win, win, win. In pe­ri­ods, you have to be ready for some tough mo­ments.</p>
    <p>“The con­fi­dence has to re­main be­cause we were play­ing very well and the ta­ble is very tight at the top level. We are much closer than we were to the top last year. We just need to re­mind our­selves of the great things we were do­ing be­fore these two games.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea’s Hakim Ziyech, Cal­lum Hud­son-Odoi and Reece James are in­jury doubts, while Moyes will give a late fit­ness test to Michail An­to­nio.</p>
    <p>FRANKLY SPEAK­ING</p>
    <p>The re­al­ism is we are not a Liver­pool of last year or a Manch­ester City of the year be­fore where you can just... win, win, win, win, win. In pe­ri­ods, you have to be ready for some tough mo­ments.</p>
