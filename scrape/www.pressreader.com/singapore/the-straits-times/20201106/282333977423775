    <p>TOKYO • Tokyo’s abil­ity to cope with the Covid-19 pan­demic and stage next year’s Olympic Games safely will un­dergo a ma­jor test this week­end, with gym­nasts from four na­tions gath­er­ing in the Ja­panese cap­i­tal for a friendly com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>The meet on Sun­day – fea­tur­ing 30 gym­nasts from Ja­pan, the United States, China and Rus­sia – marks the first in­ter­na­tional event at a Tokyo Olympics venue since the Games were post­poned i n March due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While up to 2,000 spec­ta­tors will be fo­cused on the ath­letes, who will be mixed into “Friend­ship” and “Sol­i­dar­ity” teams re­gard­less of na­tion­al­ity or gen­der, the real com­pe­ti­tion will be be­hind the scenes as or­gan­is­ers go all out to keep the coro­n­avirus at bay.</p>
    <p>“If some­body gets in­fected dur­ing this meet, it will be called off and if that hap­pens, it also puts whether we can hold the Olympics into ques­tion,” Ja­panese gym­nast Wataru Tani­gawa said. “In that sense I feel a huge stress, but all I can do is be as care­ful as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Mea­sures drawn up in con­sul­ta­tion with the In­ter­na­tional Gym­nas­tics Fed­er­a­tion (FIG) in­clude hav­ing ath­letes – quar­an­tined for two weeks prior to ar­riv­ing in Ja­pan – move only be­tween their ho­tel and the venue on buses dis­in­fected nightly.</p>
    <p>Staff will take shop­ping re­quests, with se­cu­rity guards posted at ho­tel el­e­va­tors.</p>
    <p>Be­fore en­ter­ing or leav­ing the com­pe­ti­tion floor, gym­nasts will dis­in­fect their hands and feet. They will bring their own chalk, for­merly shared, and be tested daily.</p>
    <p>Spec­ta­tors must have tem­per­a­ture checks with ther­mog­ra­phy and pro­vide con­tact de­tails as well as two weeks of prior health in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>A false pos­i­tive Covid-19 test for Ja­pan’s three-time Olympic gold medal­list Ko­hei Uchimura last week em­pha­sised the stakes and alarmed or­gan­is­ers, who had ear­lier said they were feel­ing “the great­est pres­sure of their ca­reer”.</p>
    <p>He sub­se­quently tested neg­a­tive and has been cleared to par­tic­i­pate.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has suc­cess­fully held events in sta­di­ums with thou­sands of spec­ta­tors, and ex­perts say the gym­nas­tics event could prove an im­por­tant next step.</p>
    <p>“Gym­nas­tics is one of the sports which may have rel­a­tively lower risk for spread­ing Covid-19,” said Koji Wada, a pro­fes­sor at Tokyo’s In­ter­na­tional Univer­sity of Health and Wel­fare. “So that would be very good prac­tice for Ja­pan, and also for the rest of the world.”</p>
    <p>Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ers said they would be watch­ing the meet closely. “In pre­par­ing for the Games next year, we con­sider the coun­ter­mea­sures and other or­gan­i­sa­tional meth­ods adopted for such events, in­clud­ing the com­pe­ti­tion on Nov 8, to be an im­por­tant ref­er­ence,” they said.</p>
