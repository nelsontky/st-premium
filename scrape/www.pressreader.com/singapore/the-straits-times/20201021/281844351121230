    <p>BALI • Dis­mayed by the plas­tic waste strewn over their home is­land of Bali, sis­ters Me­lati and Is­abel Wi­jsen have chan­nelled Ted Talks and in­ter­na­tional con­fer­ences in rais­ing global aware­ness through a youth-led move­ment to try to elim­i­nate the scourge.</p>
    <p>It was not “rocket sci­ence”, said 19-year-old Me­lati, re­fer­ring to the plas­tic waste prob­lem that led her and Is­abel, 17, to set up their Bye Bye Plas­tic Bags ini­tia­tive seven years ago.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign has grown in­ter­na­tion­ally, with Bali lead­ing the way in In­done­sia ban­ning sin­gle-use plas­tic bags.</p>
    <p>The sis­ters are not rest­ing on their lau­rels. Tack­ling cli­mate change is now among the world’s most press­ing is­sues, they said.</p>
    <p>“We know the ur­gency, we have to take ac­tion now,” said Me­lati, speak­ing from their home sur­rounded by padi fields.</p>
    <p>“We need to see the bar set a lot higher and a lot sooner,” she said, call­ing on pol­i­cy­mak­ers to take swift ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Me­lati’s ac­tivism started when she was only 12 years old and her sis­ter even younger at 10.</p>
    <p>They have since gar­nered global at­ten­tion, speak­ing at in­ter­na­tional con­fer­ences, in­clud­ing set­ting out their ideas in a Ted Talk.</p>
    <p>The sis­ters said they were in­spired, when at school, by fig­ures such as Nel­son Man­dela, Princess Diana and Ma­hatma Gandhi.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up on the trop­i­cal is­land famed for its beaches and tem­ples, they were dis­con­certed by the plas­tic waste ev­ery­where. “Sadly... we could see that no mat­ter where we went, there was plas­tic con­stantly sur­round­ing us,” Me­lati said.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem peaks dur­ing the rainy sea­son, be­tween De­cem­ber and Fe­bru­ary, when rivers filled with waste spew it out into es­tu­ar­ies and the ocean.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia, an ar­chi­pel­ago of more than 17,000 is­lands, is es­ti­mated to be the world’s sec­ond­largest con­trib­u­tor of plas­tic pol­lu­tants in the oceans af­ter China, ac­cord­ing to a 2015 study pub­lished in Sci­ence jour­nal.</p>
    <p>This year, In­done­sia un­veiled a plan to cut ma­rine plas­tic de­bris by 70 per cent within five years and to be plas­tic pol­lu­tion-free by 2040.</p>
    <p>But for the sis­ters, mea­sures on the en­vi­ron­ment are of­ten too slow and re­in­force the need for the young to take ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that us kids may only be 25 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, but we are 100 per cent of the fu­ture,” said Is­abel.</p>
