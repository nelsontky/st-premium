    <p>Con­tact trac­ing app TraceTo­gether will be up­graded by next month to al­low tourists to do SafeEn­try check-ins at shop­ping malls and din­ing venues, as Sin­ga­pore gets ready to move to phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>The app, which is manda­tory for over­seas vis­i­tors, will come with a new fea­ture to record and val­i­date their pass­port numbers dur­ing app reg­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Val­i­da­tion will be in­stant by check­ing against the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity’s data­base.</p>
    <p>“Just as we need to val­i­date users’ NRIC (dur­ing app signup), we need to check that the visi­tor has en­tered a valid pass­port num­ber, and that he has in­deed en­tered Sin­ga­pore,” a spokesman for the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Of­fice told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“We are ex­pect­ing to com­plete the process of pass­port val­i­da­tion some time in De­cem­ber. Vis­i­tors will need to update to the lat­est ver­sion of the app,” she added.</p>
    <p>With this ad­di­tion, tourists will be able to scan the SafeEn­try QR code us­ing their TraceTo­gether app. By the end of the year, this will be the only way for them to en­ter most premises.</p>
    <p>The move comes as Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ally re­opens its bor­ders to leisure trav­ellers, in­clud­ing those from Hong Kong, Brunei,</p>
    <p>New Zealand and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>There is no QR code scan­ning func­tion in the app ver­sion tourists cur­rently use, un­like the one that is avail­able to Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of the QR code scan­ner, tourists have been asked to show their pass­ports and the Trace To­gether app on their phones. Venue op­er­a­tors also need to man­u­ally en­ter pass­port de­tails in a com­puter or a mo­bile de­vice run­ning the Safe En­try (Business) ap­pli­ca­tion to record the visit.</p>
    <p>Tourists have also been able to use their mo­bile phone cam­era to scan the Safe En­try QR code to fill up a Web form to en­ter malls, restau­rants and cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>But the Web form will be phased out when Sin­ga­pore switches to a new Covid-19 man­age­ment tool, Trace To­gether-only Safe En­try, for manda­tory dig­i­tal con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents will not be able to use their Sing Pass mo­bile app to scan the Safe En­try QR code to en­ter places. And venue op­er­a­tors will not scan bar­codes on NRICs to al­low peo­ple en­try.</p>
    <p>The na­tion­wide switchover is slated to start at the end of the year to al­low Sin­ga­pore to host more trav­ellers, business ac­tiv­i­ties and so­cial gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Trace To­gether-only Safe En­try com­bines what are now two sep­a­rate sys­tems: Trace To­gether, to iden­tify those in close con­tact with Covid-19 pa­tients; and Safe En­try – which dig­i­tally checks in vis­i­tors at most venues – to de­ter­mine which premises have been vis­ited by those in­fected with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian cit­i­zen Ian Khoo, 33, who is in Sin­ga­pore for a few months to visit his fam­ily, said he looks for­ward to us­ing the new ver­sion of the Trace To­gether app.</p>
    <p>“I’m glad the check-in process will be stream­lined soon,” said Mr Khoo, who works in the bank­ing sec­tor Down Un­der.</p>
    <p>He uses his phone’s cam­era to scan the Safe En­try QR code, but soon this will no longer be an op­tion.</p>
    <p>He has used his pass­port to en­ter places be­fore, but said: “The process of show­ing the venue op­er­a­tor my pass­port and hav­ing them record my de­tails holds up the queue; it’s not as quick and easy as scan­ning a QR code or NRIC.”</p>
