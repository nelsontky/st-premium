    <p>Main­board-listed health­care provider New Silkroutes Group dis­closed last night that its ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Goh Jin Hian and fi­nance direc­tor Wil­liam Teo are as­sist­ing the Com­mercial Af­fairs Depart­ment (CAD) with in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>The group was re­spond­ing to queries raised by the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) re­gard­ing on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions by CAD into pos­si­ble of­fence un­der the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said it un­der­stands that the al­leged of­fence is false trad­ing and mar­ket rig­ging pur­suant to Sec­tion 197 of the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act in view of past share buy-backs and ac­qui­si­tions of shares.</p>
    <p>“All share buy-backs con­ducted by the com­pany pre­vi­ously were in the or­di­nary course and trans­acted on the open mar­ket and an­nounced in ac­cor­dance with the share buy-back man­date ap­proved by the share­hold­ers of the com­pany and the SGX-ST’s guide­lines and reg­u­la­tions,” said New Silkroutes.</p>
    <p>New Silkroutes had been told last month to hand over in­for­ma­tion and pa­pers for a po­lice probe, ac­cord­ing to the group in a bourse fil­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Kelvyn Oo, in­de­pen­dent direc­tor of Catal­istlisted oil and gas-re­lated com­pany Teho In­ter­na­tional, is also as­sist­ing with in­ves­ti­ga­tions. Mr Oo was formerly the ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor and chief cor­po­rate of­fi­cer of New Silkroutes but left on Aug 1.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the SGX’s query on whether the par­ties named are sub­jects of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion, New Silkroutes said that as far as the com­pany is aware, no charges have been made against the named par­ties. It also noted that the no­tice by CAD and the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore on Sept 24 did not dis­close the subject(s) of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>“The nom­i­nat­ing com­mit­tee and the board are of the view that Dr Goh and Mr Teo are suit­able to con­tinue as a direc­tor and/or ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the com­pany, as in­ves­ti­ga­tions are still on­go­ing and no charges have been made against them,” said the group.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh, who is the son of for­mer prime min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong, was also des­ig­nated chair­man of the com­pany with ef­fect from Aug 1, fol­low­ing the re­tire­ment of Mr Pao Kiew Tee as in­de­pen­dent direc­tor and chair­man.</p>
    <p>He re­tires as CEO with ef­fect from to­day and be­comes non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man.</p>
    <p>The pass­ports of both Dr Goh and Mr Teo have been re­tained by the CAD; nei­ther has been ar­rested nor charged, and no bail has been re­quired to be posted, noted the group.</p>
