    <p>A few days ago, when I read that tal­ent show judge Si­mon Cow­ell hurt him­self fall­ing off his new e-bike, I could pic­ture how it most likely hap­pened.</p>
    <p>The sto­ries con­tained few de­tails, but he was said to be test­ing a new elec­tric trail bike in his court­yard at the time.</p>
    <p>The words “new” and “elec­tric trail bike” stand out. I re­viewed one a few weeks ago, so I am some­thing of an ex­pert on the topic of fall­ing off one.</p>
    <p>The short of it is – the ma­chine has more power than peo­ple think. Press the throt­tle too sharply and it leaps off the line like a star­tled pony.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the rules state that e-bikes give power as­sis­tance only when the rider is ped­alling, which makes mov­ing from a stand­still less vi­o­lent, but in spite of that, the kick of the mo­tor is im­pres­sive.</p>
    <p>Un­less you have been warned about the sud­den boost, New­ton’s first law of mo­tion, which states that bod­ies at rest tend to stay at rest, will leave you tast­ing con­crete while the bike leaves for parts un­known.</p>
    <p>To­day’s e-bikes and PMDs (per­sonal mo­bil­ity de­vices) have this won­drous abil­ity to trans­port riders to homes, of­fices and the emer­gency ward be­cause of two tech­ni­cal in­no­va­tions – the brush­less mo­tor (which de­liv­ers power to the wheels in­stantly) and the lithium-ion bat­tery (which sends more juice per kg, over longer pe­ri­ods, than older lead-acid or nickel-cad­mium cells).</p>
    <p>Three, ac­tu­ally – the two break­throughs men­tioned and China’s abil­ity to put them into de­vices within buy­ing reach of ev­ery­one, in­clud­ing those who should know bet­ter.</p>
    <p>So while you may read about the des­per­ately sad cases of pedes­tri­ans who have been struck by e-bike and PMD users, the dan­ger posed by these de­vices, as Cow­ell has dis­cov­ered, is mainly to the rider.</p>
    <p>For ev­ery head­line-grab­bing ar­ti­cle about path­way users hurt by col­li­sions, self-in­flicted in­juries to the rider are prob­a­bly much more com­mon.</p>
    <p>Un­der the rules, e-bikes sold here are chip-re­stricted to a 25kmh top speed. In Cal­i­for­nia, where Cow­ell lives, e-bikes that go up to 45kmh are per­mit­ted. But un­less Cow­ell’s court­yard is the size of Jurong, it is likely he “broke his back”, as news re­ports dra­mat­i­cally put it, at a speed far be­low the limit.</p>
    <p>By the way, while it might sound mean to make light of his suf­fer­ing, “break­ing his back” sounds an aw­ful lot like Cow­ell’s pub­li­cist try­ing to in­vent a more rugged, youth­ful eu­phemism for what we non-celebri­ties would call “frac­tur­ing a hip” or “crack­ing a tail­bone”.</p>
    <p>The re­ports don’t say if he was wear­ing a hel­met, but he should count him­self for­tu­nate that his more well-padded end got the worst of it.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, any­one think­ing of buy­ing an e-bike will have to abide by ma­chine reg­u­la­tions (e.g. de­vices must be of an ap­proved model and reg­is­tered) and us­age rules (e.g. no rid­ing on foot­paths or in a dan­ger­ous man­ner).</p>
    <p>The vol­un­tary Safe Rid­ing Pro­gramme, or­gan­ised by the au­thor­i­ties, is also there for all riders wish­ing to take it.</p>
    <p>But on Day One of e-bike own­er­ship, not smack­ing into a wall boils down to ma­chine op­er­a­tion – to know­ing the dif­fer­ence be­tween the throt­tle and brake levers when dis­as­ter is one sec­ond away.</p>
    <p>As mu­sic pro­ducer Cow­ell, fa­mous for form­ing the boy band One Di­rec­tion found out, his di­rec­tion on the day of his mishap should have been to­wards the user man­ual.</p>
    <p>Un­less you have been warned about the sud­den boost, New­ton’s first law of mo­tion, which states that bod­ies at rest tend to stay at rest, will leave you tast­ing con­crete while the bike leaves for parts un­known.</p>
