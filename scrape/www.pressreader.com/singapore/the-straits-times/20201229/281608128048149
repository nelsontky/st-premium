    <p>Plan­ning to use your Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers for an out­ing with the fam­ily ? You will need your SingPass ac­count to ac­cess your vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>If you don’t have a SingPass ac­count, you can regis­ter for one at www.singpass.gov.sg. All Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 15 and above are el­i­gi­ble for an ac­count.</p>
    <p>Here are some an­swers to com­mon ques­tions about the dig­i­tal vouch­ers, which can be used till June 30.</p>
    <p>How can I use my vouch­ers if I don’t have a SingPass ac­count, mo­bile phone or In­ter­net ac­cess?</p>
    <p>Those who don’t own a mo­bile phone can still set up a SingPass ac­count on a com­puter with a cam­era. Fol­low these steps to regis­ter for one.</p>
    <p>1. Visit www.singpass.gov.sg</p>
    <p>2. Se­lect “Regis­ter for SingPass” and make a re­quest for a per­sonal iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­ber (PIN) to be sent to your mail­ing ad­dress reg­is­tered with the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity. You will re­ceive your PIN mailer within five work­ing days 3. After re­ceiv­ing your PIN mailer, log in to your SingPass ac­count to regis­ter your pass­word</p>
    <p>Once you have your SingPass ac­count, you can start us­ing your vouch­ers with the five au­tho­rised book­ing part­ners — Changi Travel Ser­vices (also known as Changi Rec­om­mends), Glob­alTix, Klook, Trip.com and Trav­eloka.</p>
    <p>You will be redi­rected to the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers por­tal dur­ing the book­ing process. Here are some things to note.</p>
    <p>1. En­sure you are mak­ing the book­ings on a com­puter with a cam­era or a fam­ily mem­ber’s smart­phone with a front-fac­ing cam­era 2. Log in to the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers por­tal with your SingPass ID and pass­word dur­ing the check­out process</p>
    <p>3. When the page prompts you for your two-fac­tor au­then­ti­ca­tion (2FA), se­lect the “Face Ver­i­fi­ca­tion” tab</p>
    <p>4. Fol­low the in­struc­tions and guide­lines 5. Con­sent to the por­tal scan­ning your face to ver­ify your iden­tity</p>
    <p>If you don’t have In­ter­net ac­cess, you can visit one of 69 phys­i­cal book­ing coun­ters, set up is­land­wide by the au­tho­rised book­ing part­ners, for help with the book­ing process.</p>
    <p>These coun­ters are lo­cated at com­mu­nity cen­tres or clubs, se­lected malls and post of­fices. Scan the QR code at the bot­tom right cor­ner of this ar­ti­cle to find your near­est book­ing counter.</p>
    <p>You will need to have your SingPass lo­gin de­tails ready at the counter. En­sure that you also have one of the ac­cepted modes of pay­ment — cash, Nets card or credit card — to book your stay­ca­tion, at­trac­tion ticket or lo­cal tour un­der the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers scheme.</p>
    <p>When can the vouch­ers be used?</p>
    <p>There’s no need to rush. The dig­i­tal Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers can be redeemed and used any­time till June 30.</p>
    <p>For now, they can be used on more than 2,800 tourism prod­ucts and ex­pe­ri­ences. Visit the five au­tho­rised book­ing part­ners for the full list of el­i­gi­ble mer­chants.</p>
    <p>How do the child/youth sub­si­dies work? Do I need to have chil­dren to en­joy these sub­si­dies?</p>
    <p>All Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 18 and above this year, whether a par­ent, grand­par­ent, le­gal guardian or ex­tended fam­ily mem­ber, can buy up to six child/youth tick­ets, each sub­sidised by $10.</p>
    <p>The tick­ets must be for fam­ily mem­bers un­der the age of 18 and have to be used by June 30. The sub­sidy can only be used for at­trac­tions and tours that of­fer a child/ youth price and will be au­to­mat­i­cally de­ducted from the to­tal cost of your book­ings when you check out.</p>
    <p>Visit go.gov.sg/sr­vouch­ers for more in­for­ma­tion on child/youth sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>Can I sell or trans­fer my Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers to oth­ers?</p>
    <p>No, the sale or trans­fer of your dig­i­tal Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers to oth­ers is not al­lowed as they are tied to your SingPass ac­count and meant for per­sonal use only.</p>
    <p>You can share feed­back or re­port to ethics@stb.gov.sg if you come across such ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There may be some mer­chants that al­low you to give your prod­ucts to oth­ers after you pur­chase them with your vouch­ers. In those cases, you must first make your pur­chase us­ing your own dig­i­tal Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers Vouch­ers be­fore gift­ing the prod­ucts to oth­ers for their use.</p>
    <p>You are en­cour­aged to en­joy the prod­ucts you have pur­chased with your vouch­ers. Take this op­por­tu­nity, amid your busy sched­ule, to spend qual­ity time and bond with your loved ones.</p>
