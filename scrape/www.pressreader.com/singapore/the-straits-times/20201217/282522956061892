    <p>Patty Jenk­ins (right) broke the mould – and a bunch of box-of­fice records – when she di­rected 2017’s Won­der Woman.</p>
    <p>A crit­i­cal and com­mer­cial smash, it was the first time a woman had di­rected a ma­jor su­per­hero film, and the first fe­male-di­rected film of any kind with a bud­get of more than US$100 mil­lion (S$133 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>At the Amer­i­can box of­fice, it still stands as the high­est­gross­ing movie from a solo fe­male di­rec­tor, sur­passed by only Frozen 2 (2019), which was co-di­rected by Jen­nifer Lee and Chris Buck, and Cap­tain Marvel (2019), co-di­rected by Anna Bo­den and Ryan Fleck.</p>
    <p>But of the many com­pli­ments she gets for that film, Jenk­ins’ favourites are from peo­ple who did not think they liked su­per­hero sto­ries at all.</p>
    <p>Some were even friends of hers who were reluc­tant to go see it be­cause they felt they were not the tar­get au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>“When I was done with that film, I had a bunch of peo­ple I know – some of them quite old – come and see it,” she tells The Straits Times in an in­ter­view in Los An­ge­les. “And some were, like, ‘I don’t want to go see it, Patti. I don’t know what I’m go­ing to tell you.’”</p>
    <p>But it was her goal to win over this very crowd.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause these are metaphors. And I want to make this a movie for ev­ery­body, whether you like su­per­hero movies or not,” says Jenk­ins, whose first fea­ture film was the gritty crime biopic Mon­ster (2003), which won Char­l­ize Theron the Best Ac­tress Os­car for her por­trayal of se­rial killer Aileen Wuornos.</p>
    <p>The film-maker hopes to do this again with Won­der Woman 1984.</p>
    <p>The se­quel, which Jenk­ins co-wrote as well as di­rected, is a cri­tique of con­tem­po­rary cap­i­tal­ism and greed told through the lens of the free-spend­ing 1980s, says the 49-year-old.</p>
    <p>She de­cided to set it in that era af­ter ask­ing her­self the ques­tion, “What is the evil of our time?”, and com­ing to the con­clu­sion that it was unchecked ma­te­ri­al­ism.</p>
    <p>So, the vil­lains of the piece, Maxwell Lord (Pe­dro Pas­cal) and Bar­bara Ann Min­erva/Chee­tah (Kris­ten Wiig), re­flect that.</p>
    <p>“None of us is im­mune to ex­cess and want­ing op­u­lence and these vil­lains are very much born from that – it’s who they want to be.”</p>
    <p>But just as she made sure Diana Prince/Won­der Woman was fully three-di­men­sional emo­tion­ally, Jenk­ins wanted her neme­ses to be more than just mous­ta­chetwirlin­g, pan­tomime vil­lains.</p>
    <p>“I try to find an emo­tion­ally truth­ful an­chor on all char­ac­ters. And if these are all metaphors, these vil­lains should sym­bol­ise some­thing we have an an­chor to emo­tion­ally, whether it’s rage, bit­ter­ness or some­thing else.”</p>
    <p>The 1980s – which Jenk­ins ex­trav­a­gantly recre­ated for the film, from the elec­tron­ica sound­track to the glit­tery fash­ion – epit­o­mise that ra­bid ma­te­ri­al­ism, she adds.</p>
    <p>“What I thought was so in­ter­est­ing about set­ting it in that time is that we were at a high point of cel­e­brat­ing that – and we still haven’t stopped even though we’re sit­ting in the wreck­age of it.</p>
    <p>“And it’s able to re­flect a light on the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>At the same time, she also set out to make a slick, en­ter­tain­ing, adren­a­line-soaked ad­ven­ture for su­per­hero junkies – one which in­cludes the req­ui­site ac­tion se­quences, which got even big­ger and more elab­o­rate for the sec­ond in­stal­ment.</p>
    <p>The idea is for au­di­ences to be able to en­joy the story on that level too – even if they are not aware of the big­ger ideas bub­bling be­neath the sur­face.</p>
    <p>She says: “This is a clas­si­cal tale and, in telling these kinds of sto­ries, the su­per­hero (el­e­ment) is al­most a Tro­jan horse to tell a dif­fer­ent grand tale.”</p>
