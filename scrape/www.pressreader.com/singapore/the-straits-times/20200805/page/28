Two years ago today, God said "My son, come Home, you have endured more than what you can take". God had watched over you for 69 years and He heard and knew your hurts and your suffering. You broke our hearts when you left us without warning and since then life in our family is not the same without you. We love you, our little brother and we miss you. Till we meet again.
