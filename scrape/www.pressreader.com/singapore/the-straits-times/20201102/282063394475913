    <p>Sup­pli­ers will be paid for their con­sign­ment goods that have been sold by Robin­sons since last Fri­day, said the re­tailer’s ap­pointed liq­uida­tor Kor­daMen­tha yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons had an­nounced last</p>
    <p>Fri­day that it would close its last two depart­ment stores in Sin­ga­pore. The sud­den news sparked con­fu­sion among its sup­pli­ers, some of whom said they felt mis­led by the re­tailer, which had asked them to plan for fu­ture events such as the Black Fri­day sale this month as well as Christ­mas and Chi­nese New Year sales.</p>
    <p>They added that they were not in­formed of Robin­sons’ clo­sure in ad­vance and learnt about it only af­ter read­ing the news. They noted that they are still owed pay­ments and are not sure when they will be paid.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries yes­ter­day, Kor­daMen­tha said it is work­ing with con­sign­ment goods sup­pli­ers to en­sure that they will be paid for sales made af­ter last Fri­day should they wish to con­tinue to stock their prod­ucts in the out­lets.</p>
    <p>Ms Vera Ong, owner of table­ware com­pany Lovera Col­lec­tions which sells goods at Robin­sons’ The Heeren branch, said she had a tough time con­tact­ing the out­let about whether she could re­trieve stock af­ter the clo­sure was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>“We are not like some other brands that hire pro­mot­ers, so we needed to con­firm if we could re­trieve our stock be­fore we made the trip down,” added Ms Ong, who man­aged to col­lect the goods on Satur­day, with her baby in tow.</p>
    <p>She said the re­tailer was un­likely to have de­cided to liq­ui­date its</p>
    <p>stores overnight “but they dropped the bomb on Fri­day, with no in­for­ma­tion on how we can start to exit our prod­ucts”.</p>
    <p>She added that Robin­sons owes her com­pany $6,400 for goods sold from Au­gust to last month, and that there is no in­di­ca­tion of when it will re­ceive the money.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, a spokesman for soft fur­nish­ings com­pany In­tero En­ter­prise said Robin­sons owes it a “sub­stan­tial amount” of money for items sold in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>For goods sold on con­sign­ment, the re­tailer takes a cut from the sales pro­ceeds of its ven­dor brands, be­fore pay­ing them the re­main­ing amount.</p>
    <p>The news of the stores’ clo­sure comes at a time when busi­nesses are al­ready grap­pling with the fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Lovera Col­lec­tions, which also sells table­ware to restau­rants and cafes, has seen its sales fall as fewer eater­ies are open­ing now.</p>
    <p>Its space at Robin­sons was the only phys­i­cal re­tail pres­ence it had. The brand will con­tinue with its sales on e-com­merce plat­forms, as this in­volves the “least risk and costs”, said Ms Ong.</p>
    <p>The In­tero En­ter­prise spokesman said with the re­tailer’s re­cent e-mails to ven­dors to pre­pare for up­com­ing sales events, there was “no way we would think that the com­pany would go into liq­ui­da­tion”.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just about the loss of a re­tail icon. There are also many ca­su­al­ties and peo­ple be­hind the scenes, such as SMEs (small and medium-sized en­ter­prises) with lim­ited re­sources and fi­nan­cial ca­pa­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Asked whether Robin­sons will pay its con­sign­ment sup­pli­ers in the com­ing weeks, Kor­daMen­tha said it will en­sure con­sign­ment sales made since last Fri­day are re­ported and that sup­pli­ers are paid un­der their nor­mal trad­ing terms with the re­tailer.</p>
    <p>On claims from sup­pli­ers about e-mails from Robin­sons ask­ing them to pre­pare for up­com­ing sales events, Kor­daMen­tha said it was un­able to com­ment as it was ap­pointed only late last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Kor­daMen­tha added that af­ter it was ap­pointed, it no­ti­fied all sup­pli­ers in writ­ing and gave them a proof of debt form to al­low them to record their claims against Robin­sons, which is stan­dard pro­ce­dure in all liq­ui­da­tions.</p>
    <p>Long queues formed over the week­end out­side Robin­sons’ out­lets at The Heeren and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre, as shop­pers rushed to bid good­bye to the 162-year-old depart­ment store.</p>

They noted that Robin&#xAD;sons had re&#xAD;cently asked them for sales plans for Christ&#xAD;mas and Chi&#xAD;nese New Year.</p>
