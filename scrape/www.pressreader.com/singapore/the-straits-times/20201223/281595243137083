    <p>Chua Ser Lien, 58, sen­tenced to life im­pris­on­ment and three strokes of the cane in 2004 for his role in a kid­nap­ping, killed him­self on</p>
    <p>July 8 this year at Changi Prison. An in­quiry into his death re­vealed yes­ter­day that prison of­fi­cers had not been neg­li­gent and Chua had been re­ceiv­ing ap­pro­pri­ate med­i­cal treat­ment while be­hind bars.</p>
    <p>A man, sen­tenced to life im­pris­on­ment and three strokes of the cane in 2004 for his role in a sev­enyear-old girl’s kid­nap­ping the pre­vi­ous year, killed him­self on July 8 this year at Changi Prison.</p>
    <p>Chua Ser Lien, 58, who had a his­tory of bipo­lar dis­or­der and was serv­ing his sen­tence at the prison’s psy­chi­atric hous­ing unit, had climbed a flight of stairs from the third storey to the fourth, then climbed up in­ter­nal rail­ings, be­fore re­leas­ing his grip.</p>
    <p>He hit his neck and the back of his head when he fell, and landed at the foot of the third-floor stair­case. He was rushed to Changi Gen­eral Hospi­tal and died of a head in­jury at 10.15am that day.</p>
    <p>An in­quiry into his death re­vealed yes­ter­day that prison of­fi­cers had not been neg­li­gent and Chua had been re­ceiv­ing ap­pro­pri­ate med­i­cal treat­ment while be­hind bars. He had also dis­played no sui­ci­dal ten­den­cies.</p>
    <p>Coro­ner Marvin Bay, who said there was no ba­sis to sus­pect foul play, found that Chua had killed him­self. “Mea­sures have been put in place af­ter this event, with in­struc­tions given that no in­mate is to re­main alone at all times out­side the cell,” the coro­ner said. “It is un­der­stood that other safety mea­sures are un­der re­view to pre­vent any re­cur­rence, in­clud­ing a pos­si­ble sen­sor sys­tem to warn of per­sons who are near the rail­ings.”</p>
    <p>Chua, who used to own a clean­ing com­pany, was one of two men linked to the girl’s kid­nap­ping.</p>
    <p>They ab­ducted her from her home off Yio Chu Kang Road at about 4.30pm on Christ­mas Day in 2003. A cater­ing as­sis­tant, who was at the girl’s home pre­par­ing for a Christ­mas party, heard a com­mo­tion and, upon see­ing the get­away ve­hi­cle, took down its li­cence plate num­ber. The cater­ing as­sis­tant alerted her hus­band, who gave chase. The kid­nap­pers re­leased the girl off Tampines Street 72, half an hour af­ter tak­ing her.</p>
    <p>Chua and his ac­com­plice, trans­port man­ager Tan Ping Koon, then 35, were each sen­tenced to life im­pris­on­ment and three strokes of the cane in 2004.</p>
    <p>Re­lat­ing the se­quence of events lead­ing up to Chua’s death this year, Coro­ner Bay said Chua’s fel­low in­mates had gone off for their sched­uled one hour of tele­vi­sion time at around 8.30am.</p>
    <p>Closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion footage played in court yes­ter­day showed Chua walk­ing up a flight of stairs to the fourth storey. An­other clip shows him climb­ing onto rail­ings near a stair­well. Prison staff were alerted, but he re­leased his grip be­fore he could be taken to safety.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice (SPS) said: “Fol­low­ing a post-in­ci­dent re­view, SPS is study­ing the fea­si­bil­ity of in­stalling mo­tion sen­sors which will alert staff should an in­mate come too close to the rail­ing and/or in­stalling ad­di­tional rail­ings at the stairs to de­ter in­mates from scal­ing from the stairs to the rail­ings.”</p>
    <p>It added: “SPS of­fi­cers had reached out to Mr Chua’s fam­ily af­ter his demise to ex­tend any help and as­sis­tance re­quired. SPS again con­veys our deep­est con­do­lences to Mr Chua’s fam­ily.”</p>
