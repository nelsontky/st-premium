    <p>A group of reli­gious lead­ers, aca­demics and so­cial ad­vo­cates from var­i­ous faiths came to­gether yes­ter­day for an in­ter­na­tional we­bi­nar – hosted by Jamiyah Sin­ga­pore and opened by Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob – to dis­cuss the role they can play as the world con­tin­ues to grap­ple with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Home-grown in­surer Sin­ga­pore Life (Singlife) in­tends to merge with Aviva Sin­ga­pore in a deal val­ued at $3.2 bil­lion, which will make it one of the largest in the South­east Asian in­sur­ance sec­tor and the largest in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment is­sued last night,</p>
    <p>Singlife said the deal will bring its mo­bile sav­ings and pro­tec­tion so­lu­tions to Aviva’s 1.5 mil­lion strong cus­tomer base, and of­fer ex­ist­ing Singlife cus­tomers a deeper prod­uct range and ad­vi­sory ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The trans­ac­tion is sub­ject to clos­ing con­di­tions, in­clud­ing reg­u­la­tory ap­proval, and is ex­pected to com­plete by Jan­uary next year. The merger of the Singlife and Aviva Sin­ga­pore le­gal en­ti­ties is tar­geted to take place in the first half of next year, sub­ject to ap­proval by the Sin­ga­pore courts.</p>
    <p>Un­til the merger is com­plete, Singlife and Aviva Sin­ga­pore will con­tinue to op­er­ate in­de­pen­dently.</p>
    <p>When merged, the new com­bined busi­ness will ini­tially be named Aviva Singlife, and will ini­tially trade us­ing both the Singlife and Aviva brands.</p>
    <p>Sub­ject to reg­u­la­tory ap­proval, cur­rent Singlife chair­man Ray Fer­gu­son will con­tinue as chair­man of the new group. Singlife group chief ex­ec­u­tive Wal­ter de Oude will be ap­pointed deputy chair­man, and cur­rent Aviva Sin­ga­pore chief ex­ec­u­tive Nishit Ma­j­mu­dar will be ap­pointed chief ex­ec­u­tive of the com­bined en­tity’s Sin­ga­pore li­censed in­sur­ance busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Aviva will re­tain a 25 per cent equity share­hold­ing in the new busi­ness, while Singlife’s ex­ist­ing share­holder Su­mit­omo Life In­sur­ance Com­pany will hold 20 per cent. Aflac Ven­tures, Aberdeen As­set Man­age­ment, IPGL Lim­ited and mi­nori­ties will col­lec­tively hold 20 per cent. Global al­ter­na­tive as­set firm TPG will hold the re­main­ing 35 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Fer­gu­son noted that Covid-19 and chang­ing con­sumer de­mands have cre­ated more in­ter­est in mo­bile sav­ings and pro­tec­tion so­lu­tions, as well as in on-de­mand fi­nan­cial ad­vice.</p>
    <p>“By join­ing forces with Aviva Sin­ga­pore, we are cre­at­ing a home­grown re­gional brand that will go far be­yond in­sur­ance and de­liver on these am­bi­tions by cre­at­ing in­no­va­tive fi­nan­cial prod­ucts with in­tu­itive tech­nol­ogy and in­de­pen­dent ad­vice,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma­j­mu­dar said the part­ner­ship will boost Aviva Sin­ga­pore’s cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Join­ing forces with Singlife, known for its mo­bile-first ap­proach, will fur­ther en­hance what we de­liver – a com­pre­hen­sive set of so­lu­tions with a su­pe­rior cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence,” he added.</p>
    <p>Said Mr de Oude: “We are build­ing some­thing truly in­spi­ra­tional, har­ness­ing the best of fi­nan­cial ser­vices for the ben­e­fit of Sin­ga­pore­ans and the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>The part­ner­ship is Singlife’s most sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone to date, with its pre­vi­ous mile­stone be­ing its ac­qui­si­tion of Zurich Life Sin­ga­pore in 2018. Singlife man­ages al­most $7 bil­lion in life in­sur­ance cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>Aviva Sin­ga­pore’s busi­nesses in­cluded in the trans­ac­tion are its in­sur­ance busi­ness, unit trust plat­forms Nav­i­ga­tor and dol­larDEX, and two of the largest fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory firms in Sin­ga­pore, Aviva Fi­nan­cial Ad­vis­ers and Pro­fes­sional In­vest­ment Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices.</p>
