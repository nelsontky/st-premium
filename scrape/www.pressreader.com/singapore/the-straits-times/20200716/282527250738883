    <p>Deep in the cav­ernous sound stages of Lan­g­ley Stu­dios in Slough, just be­yond Lon­don’s western bor­ders, a bat­tle is im­mi­nent. Arthur, the fa­bled war­rior-king of Bri­tish legends, is un­der siege. The Vik­ings are com­ing and blood­shed is set to fol­low.</p>
    <p>This is the set of Cursed, which pre­mieres on Net­flix to­mor­row, a se­ries adapted from the 2019 il­lus­trated novel by au­thor Tom Wheeler and artist-sto­ry­teller Frank Miller. Their 10-part se­ries trav­els down the fa­mil­iar tracks of the Arthurian legends, al­though it hopes to cast those paths in a new light.</p>
    <p>The sets, whether the wind­mill that is pre­par­ing for a Vik­ing as­sault or the gloomy abode of the wiz­ard</p>
    <p>Mer­lin on the sound stage next door, all have an earthy, mys­ti­cal feel. This is not a world in­hab­ited by chival­rous knights in shin­ing ar­mour be­guil­ing dewy-eyed maid­ens.</p>
    <p>“This story is not all sun­shine and light by any means,” says Miller when he joins us on set. “You don’t walk away from this say­ing how glam­orous it is.”</p>
    <p>Miller, 63, is renowned the world over for his gritty, ground­break­ing graphic nov­els — Ronin, Bat­man: Year One, Sin City and 300. He also shared di­rect­ing du­ties with Robert Ro­driguez on his pair of Sin City films (2005 and 2014) and worked as a pro­ducer on the 2006 movie adap­tion of 300.</p>
    <p>Cursed be­gan as a con­ver­sa­tion with Wheeler, who served as the showrun­ner for the su­per­hero se­ries The Cape (2011). The two de­cided to pool their tal­ents into an il­lus­trated novel for the teenage mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Then just as they were sign­ing their deal with pub­lisher Si­mon & Schus­ter, “Net­flix got wind of it”, says Wheeler when he ar­rives on set, “and they wore us down — in a good way. The book was only three­quar­ters of the way done when we started to prep the se­ries”.</p>
    <p>For Miller, the jour­ney to Cursed started long ago, way back in his child­hood.</p>
    <p>As he stands on set, his slim form wrapped in black and his head cov­ered in his sig­na­ture trilby hat, the Amer­i­can talks an­i­mat­edly about a large col­lec­tion of books that loomed large in his child­hood. It is within their cov­ers that his love of the Arthurian ad­ven­tures was forged.</p>
    <p>“When I was a boy, I was al­ways draw­ing and was fix­ated on this won­der­ful col­lec­tion of an­tique chil­dren’s books I’d got from my mother’s fam­ily,” he says. “When my mother died she willed the lot to me and they were a tremen­dous in­flu­ence on me.</p>
    <p>“And not just in terms of draw­ing – but in terms of what sto­ries are be­cause these did not con­de­scend. A lot of them were Arthurian and a lot were based on the leg­end that be­came Wag­ner’s Ring Cy­cle.”</p>
    <p>As Wag­ner’s great op­eras at­test, the Arthurian sagas are a rich source of nar­ra­tive in­spi­ra­tion. Their retellings are never far from the screen. Guy Ritchie, for ex­am­ple, brought his retelling to cin­e­mas with King Arthur: Leg­end Of The Sword in 2017.</p>
    <p>“I was in­trigued to see what the Arthurian world would be like through Frank’s eyes,” says Wheeler. “We felt King Arthur had been mined quite ex­ten­sively, and re­cently.”</p>
    <p>While scout­ing for their ap­proach, Wheeler tried to imag­ine the Arthurian world through the eyes of his 12-year-old daugh­ter. “And that seemed a great op­por­tu­nity,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Frank does great fe­male hero and anti-hero char­ac­ters, so we thought we could broaden the can­vas of fe­male he­roes in this mythol­ogy.”</p>
    <p>Their story, there­fore, is told through the young heroine Nimue, played by 24-year-old Aus­tralian ac­tress Kather­ine Lang­ford. She was in the Net­flix se­ries 13 Rea­sons Why (2017 to 2020) — for which she re­ceived a Golden Globe nom­i­na­tion for best ac­tress in a tele­vi­sion drama — and the pop­u­lar 2019 who­dunit movie Knives Out.</p>
    <p>“We loved the Nimue char­ac­ter,” adds Wheeler, “and her story as the Lady of the Lake.”</p>
    <p>In the me­di­ae­val Arthurian sto­ries, the Lady of the Lake is a name as­signed to sev­eral dif­fer­ent women, al­though many bear the name Nimue. In Mal­lory’s 15th cen­tury Morte D’arthur – the foun­da­tion stone for many mod­ern in­ter­pre­ta­tions – she is re­spon­si­ble for giv­ing Arthur the fa­bled sword Ex­cal­ibur. In other well-known me­di­ae­val retellings, Nimue be­witches the fa­bled ma­gi­cian Mer­lin.</p>
    <p>Meet­ing with the press on set dur­ing her day off, Lang­ford is brim­ming with en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>She says: “Nimue rep­re­sents courage and she’s a hope­ful bea­con and an in­ter­est­ing heroine, both in the Arthurian legends and presently. It’s quite timely to see a heroine’s jour­ney like this one.”</p>
    <p>Wheeler is eager for the world to see that jour­ney un­fold and he thinks peo­ple will be sur­prised. “This is a dark, dark fairy tale, and there’s enough vi­o­lence for the whole fam­ily.”</p>
