    <p>Manch­ester United man­ager</p>
    <p>Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer re­fused to rule out sign­ing Borus­sia Dort­mund for­ward Jadon San­cho this sum­mer, con­firm­ing only that his side are still work­ing to strengthen, while also call­ing for pa­tience amid grow­ing fan frus­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Manch­ester United have spent most of the close sea­son at­tempt­ing to sign Borus­sia Dort­mund for­ward Jadon San­cho.</p>
    <p>The deal is still not com­pletely dead, ac­cord­ing to re­ports. But, while man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer would only con­firm that the club are still look­ing to strengthen af­ter sign­ing just Ajax mid­fielder Donny van de Beek, he has also called for pa­tience amid grow­ing fan frus­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at his press con­fer­ence ahead of his team’s Pre­mier League opener at Old Traf­ford against Crys­tal Palace to­day, he said: “Fans will al­ways want the best pos­si­ble Man United team to watch.</p>
    <p>“Last sea­son we got third, which was a big step for­ward; ev­ery­one saw devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“We want to take a step for­ward and we can go into the new sea­son with con­fi­dence, but we’re look­ing to give the group a boost and we’re work­ing on it.</p>
    <p>“Of course, we’ve done some busi­ness with Donny, very de­lighted. I can’t say any­thing about other clubs’ play­ers, can’t spec­u­late.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand to get fur­ther we need to strengthen the team but let’s wait and see if we man­age to bring any­one in.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been in di­a­logue with the club.”</p>
    <p>United kick off their cam­paign to­day on the back of a 14-game un­beaten run in the English top flight.</p>
    <p>Their mid­field has been bol­stered by the ar­rival of van de Beek, but the squad re­mains thread­bare in other ar­eas of the field.</p>
    <p>A weary end to their cam­paign a lit­tle over a month ago in the Europa League semi-fi­nal l oss to Sevilla ex­posed the squad’s lack of depth.</p>
    <p>Van de Beek’s ar­rival apart, that prob­lem has not been solved.</p>
    <p>San­cho re­mains at Dort­mund with United re­fus­ing to meet the Ger­mans’ €120 mil­lion (S$192.8 mil­lion) ask­ing price, while there have been no re­in­force­ments in de­fence ahead of a gru­elling cam­paign that will see them re­turn to the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions also re­main over whether er­ror-prone goal­keeper David de Gea will be dropped.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer has made one big de­ci­sion by keeping faith with Harry Maguire as club cap­tain de­spite the de­fender be­ing handed a 21-month sus­pended jail sen­tence by a Greek court – which he has ap­pealed – for a brawl on hol­i­day in Mykonos.</p>
    <p>An­other big call awaits to­day on who to start in goal, with Dean Hen­der­son re­turn­ing af­ter an im­pres­sive loan spell at Sh­effield United.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the field, United have an at­tack­ing tri­dent that could ter­rorise the Pre­mier League for years to come, even if</p>
    <p>MAN UNITED AT WORK</p>
    <p>We un­der­stand to get fur­ther we need to strengthen the team but let’s wait and see if we man­age to bring any­one in. I’ve been in di­a­logue with the club.</p>
    <p>OLE GUN­NAR SOL­SK­JAER, Man United man­ager, on get­ting more play­ers.</p>
    <p>they fail to land San­cho.</p>
    <p>Mar­cus Rash­ford, Anthony Mar­tial and Ma­son Green­wood com­bined for 63 goals last sea­son.</p>
    <p>Should all three con­tinue to im­prove and stay fit, United do have the fire­power if fa­tigue does not get in the way.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer de­fended both Maguire and Green­wood, who was dropped from the Eng­land squad af­ter breach­ing Covid-19 pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>Green­wood and Manch­ester City’s Phil Fo­den were forced to fly home from Ice­land this month af­ter they were caught mix­ing with lo­cal women in the Eng­land ho­tel.</p>
    <p>“Yeah, of course I’ve spo­ken to</p>
    <p>Ma­son,” said Sol­sk­jaer, who added that he had ear­lier made a re­quest to Eng­land not to pick Green­wood as the 18-year-old needed a rest.</p>
    <p>“The kid had a fan­tas­tic sea­son. He’s just come through.</p>
    <p>“You come to the end of the sea­son and we’ve had less than two weeks off and he’s called up to the na­tional team.</p>
    <p>“I tried my best to give him a rest over the sum­mer. The club asked specif­i­cally and pointed out that he should have had a rest.</p>
    <p>“We’ve done what­ever we can to pro­tect him.”</p>
    <p>Green­wood has been train­ing with United af­ter pass­ing coro­n­avirus tests and the Nor­we­gian con­firmed he is in con­tention to fea­ture to­day.</p>
    <p>The for­mer United for­ward is also con­fi­dent Maguire can fo­cus fully on foot­ball.</p>
    <p>“Know­ing Harry, he’s a very strong char­ac­ter so hope­fully he can put that apart,” Sol­sk­jaer said.</p>
    <p>“It will be in the back of his mind what’s hap­pened this sum­mer, and apart from that you’ve just got to see how it de­vel­ops.”</p>
