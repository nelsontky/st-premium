    <p>In an an­i­mated re­count­ing of events, re­tired lo­cal ac­tor-direc­tor Ng Aik Leong told a court that the Bangladesh­i em­ployee he is ac­cused of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt to had given him the “right” to “ham­mer” him.</p>
    <p>Ng, 59, bet­ter known as Huang Yil­iang, claimed trial yes­ter­day to a charge of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt to Mr Jahidul at the Sin­ga­pore Is­lamic Hub (SIH) in Brad­dell Road at around 4.20pm on Dec 11, 2018.</p>
    <p>He al­legedly at­tacked Mr Jahidul, a Bangladesh­i who worked for him, by us­ing a metal scraper with a wooden han­dle – hitting him twice on the ab­domen and once on the head. This caused an in­jury to the worker’s scalp and an abra­sion on his up­per ab­domen.</p>
    <p>Ng rep­re­sented him­self, while Mr Jahidul was not present in court as he is cur­rently be­ing iso­lated at a foreign worker dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>It was not re­vealed dur­ing the trial what busi­ness Ng was run­ning for which Mr Jahidul was in his em­ploy.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Chong Kee En called three wit­nesses to the stand yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­ham­mad Akhtar Ab­dul Khalil, a se­cu­rity of­fi­cer at SIH, said in court that he was told there was a com­mo­tion at the can­teen, where he saw Mr Jahidul cry­ing out, say­ing he had been in­jured by his boss, Ng. Mr Akhtar said Ng had al­legedly told Mr Jahidul he was “stupid” and “did not know how to do work”.</p>
    <p>Sergeant Wes­ley Teo, one of two po­lice of­fi­cers who ar­rived at the scene, told the court that the vic­tim had seemed “dis­tressed” and “teary-eyed”, and deeply afraid of Ng.</p>
    <p>The other of­fi­cer, Staff Sergeant Lim Rong Hoe, said Ng at first de­nied any as­sault had taken place and that he had used the metal scraper to hit Mr Jahidul. But he later told Staff Sgt Lim that a “scuf­fle” had oc­curred, in­volv­ing “some push­ing and pulling”. Staff Sgt Lim said: “He also told me that the vic­tim had al­lowed him to use pun­ish­ment on him.”</p>
    <p>Ng dis­puted Mr Akhtar’s state­ment that he had told the worker he was “stupid”. Ng said he thought Mr Jahidul was “act­ing” and ex­ag­ger­at­ing his in­juries to make them out to be “100 times worse than they ac­tu­ally were”. Ng also mimed how he thought Mr Jahidul had be­haved at the scene – clutch­ing his head in mock pain and lift­ing his shirt to dis­play his ab­domen, as he claimed he “did not see any in­jury” to the ab­domen.</p>
    <p>He said Mr Jahidul had of­ten told him he was “a very good boss” and “a good teacher”, adding: “He gave me the right to hit him. This is what he told me: ‘I al­low you to ham­mer me be­cause I do things so slowly.’”</p>
    <p>Ng, who was an ac­tor for more than 20 years, was named Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tor at the an­nual Star Awards three times – in 2002, 2003 and 2006. He left Me­di­a­corp in 2008 to set up a pro­duc­tion house.</p>
    <p>Those con­victed of caus­ing hurt with a weapon can be jailed for up to seven years and fined or caned. Ng can­not be caned as he is over 50 years old.</p>
