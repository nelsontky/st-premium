    <p>It feels apt that the south­ern-most con­ti­nent of Antarc­tica, whipped by harsh winds and cov­ered in ice, should be rel­e­gated to the end of the world, be­yond the realm of hu­man ex­is­tence.</p>
    <p>Yet, life in any other part of the planet would not be the same if the world were to lose this icy desert.</p>
    <p>Re­cent sci­en­tific re­ports have pointed to the im­por­tance of the frozen parts of the world for global cli­mate, health and well-be­ing – even for peo­ple liv­ing far from the poles.</p>
    <p>One im­por­tant role of Antarc­tica is be­ing the world’s largest frozen reser­voir of wa­ter.</p>
    <p>As tem­per­a­tures warm and the land ice melts, the melt­wa­ter has nowhere to go but into the ocean.</p>
    <p>As sea lev­els con­tinue to rise, low-ly­ing parts of the world could dis­ap­pear from the maps, says sealevel rise ex­pert Ben­jamin Hor­ton from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU).</p>
    <p>Antarc­tica is im­por­tant in other ways as well, one of which is to cool the wa­ters around the con­ti­nent. Cold wa­ter holds more oxy­gen, which is con­stantly be­ing whisked into the ocean sur­face by the harsh Antarc­tic winds.</p>
    <p>And as sea ice forms, the salt left be­hind dis­solves into the sur­round­ing wa­ter, mak­ing the wa­ters sur­round­ing the con­ti­nent saltier.</p>
    <p>Denser than warm fresh wa­ter, the cold, salty wa­ter sinks. The re­sult is the for­ma­tion of oxy­gen­rich Antarc­tic Bot­tom Wa­ter, which flows to the other con­nected ocean basins on a great oceanic con­veyor belt, help­ing to ven­ti­late the deep seas of the world and al­low­ing marine crea­tures to thrive.</p>
    <p>The In­dian, Pa­cific and At­lantic oceans all meet in the South­ern Ocean.</p>
    <p>Dr Andy Smith, science leader of the i ce dy­nam­ics and palaeo­cli­mate team at the Bri­tish Antarc­tic Sur­vey, says: “Deep wa­ter from Antarc­tica fills and cools most of the deep oceans on earth and helps to drive the global ocean cir­cu­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>More­over, the sink­ing wa­ter in Antarc­tica is likely to stay in the depths of the oceans for about 1,000 years – lock­ing away the car­bon from the at­mos­phere, says Dr Elin Dare­lius, an Antarc­tic sci­en­tist based at the Bjerk­nes Cen­tre for Cli­mate Re­search in Nor­way.</p>
    <p>Car­bon diox­ide is a green­house gas that traps heat and is pri­mar­ily re­spon­si­ble for the ris­ing tem­per­a­tures on the planet.</p>
    <p>“Deep wa­ter for­ma­tion is a cen­tral link in the global ocean cir­cu­la­tion,” Dr Dare­lius tells The Straits Times. “Changes i n the deep wa­ter for­ma­tion could af­fect this global cir­cu­la­tion, which re­dis­tributes heat, nu­tri­ents and car­bon around the world.”</p>
    <p>FIRST-HAND GLIMPSE</p>
    <p>De­spite the i mpor­tance of the poles to global cli­mate and ocean cir­cu­la­tion pat­terns, they are of­ten out of sight, out of mind for those liv­ing in more hos­pitable, less re­mote climes.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, The Straits Times had a chance to visit the con­ti­nent of ice and snow on board Dy­nasty Travel’s in­au­gu­ral Antarc­tica Ex­pe­di­tion Cruise, which sailed on Nov 21 with about 200 Sin­ga­pore­ans on board.</p>
    <p>Dy­nasty Travel had char­tered the Ocean At­lantic – an ice-class ves­sel op­er­ated by the Den­mark­based Al­ba­tros Ex­pe­di­tions – which took us from Ushuaia, the south­ern-most point of South Amer­ica, to the tip of the Antarc­tic Penin­sula.</p>
    <p>Geog­ra­phers di­vide Antarc­tica into three re­gions: East and West Antarc­tica and the Antarc­tic Penin­sula.</p>
    <p>The penin­sula is a curved ex­ten­sion of the con­ti­nent that ex­tends nearly 400km north of the Antarc­tic Cir­cle and points towards the south­ern tip of South Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>It took about two days for us to sail the Drake Pas­sage, the 800kmwide body of wa­ter sep­a­rat­ing South Amer­ica from the Antarc­tic Penin­sula, which is known for its rough seas.</p>
    <p>As the ship rocked and rolled its way across the pas­sage, we were con­stantly re­minded by the ex­pe­di­tion crew to use the handrails lin­ing the walls: “One hand for you, one hand for the ship!”</p>
    <p>Yet, the cause of the tu­mul­tuous seas dreaded by trav­ellers (though the ST crew thank­fully suf­fered no sea sick­ness) is one of the rea­sons Antarc­tica is so cold.</p>
    <p>The South­ern Ocean, which en­cir­cles Antarc­tica, oc­cu­pies the only band of lat­i­tudes on earth where ocean wa­ters cir­cle the globe. The Drake Pas­sage is the nar­row­est point of the South­ern Ocean.</p>
    <p>With­out any land masses in the way, a vast ocean cur­rent can de­velop unim­peded, cir­cling from west to east around Antarc­tica.</p>
    <p>Called the Antarc­tic Cir­cum­po­lar Cur­rent, it is the world’s largest ocean cur­rent, with a flow equiv­a­lent to about 150 times the flow of all the world’s rivers com­bined, says the Aus­tralian Antarc­tic Sur­vey on its web­site. “The mas­sive flow of the (cur­rent) is driven by some of the strong­est winds on the planet... The strong winds also cre­ate some of the largest waves en­coun­tered in the ocean.”</p>
    <p>Some sci­en­tists be­lieve this cur­rent helped keep Antarc­tica iso­lated and re­duced oceanic heat trans­port to the con­ti­nent from the warmer ar­eas far­ther north.</p>
    <p>A dom­i­nant sci­en­tific hy­poth­e­sis is that this oceanic “bar­rier” helped Antarc­tica be­come what it is to­day: a con­ti­nent un­like any other, with moun­tains and val­leys draped in ice.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, the ocean gave way to shapes on the hori­zon. Af­ter two days of sail­ing, we ar­rived at the South Shet­land Is­lands.</p>
    <p>The group of land masses at the tip of the Antarc­tic Penin­sula wel­comed us with a shroud of fog.</p>
    <p>We could not see the tuxe­doed in­hab­i­tants of the isles, but we could cer­tainly hear them. In fact, the squawk of the gen­too pen­guin was the sound­track to our Antarc­tic ad­ven­ture, ac­com­pa­ny­ing us al­most ev­ery­where we went.</p>
    <p>The gen­too pen­guins are dwellers of the Antarc­tic re­gion and it was easy to iden­tify them from their or­ange beaks and the white bands on their fore­heads.</p>
    <p>But though pen­guins far out­num­ber hu­mans in Antarc­tica, it ap­pears that the icy con­ti­nent can­not re­main un­touched by the ef­fects of hu­man-caused cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>Take it from Mr Ger­ard Baker, po­lar his­to­rian and ex­pe­di­tion crew mem­ber at Al­ba­tros Ex­pe­di­tions who has spent more than 20 years work­ing in Antarc­tica.</p>
    <p>“I was for­tu­nate to visit one is­land 20 years apart, so I could see the changes in lev­els of glacia­tion there,” he tells ST.</p>
    <p>“And it is ap­par­ent that the places where we used to ski are no longer there. The is­land is also more than a foot out of wa­ter be­cause of iso­static re­bound – the weight of ice once push­ing the is­land into the ocean has dis­si­pated due to global warm­ing.”</p>
    <p>Re­search is con­tin­u­ing by var­i­ous groups of sci­en­tists to quan­tify the ef­fects of cli­mate change on Antarc­tica, its ice and how ocean cir­cu­la­tion pat­terns are af­fected as the world warms.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies show that one of the clear­est signs of global warm­ing on Antarc­tica is the ac­cel­er­at­ing rates of ice loss. Ice sheets are large blocks of ice that ex­tend at least 50,000 sq km, as de­fined by the Na­tional Snow and Ice Data Cen­tre. Cur­rently, there are two ice sheets on the planet – Antarc­tica in the South­ern Hemi­sphere and Green­land in the north.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish Antarc­tic Sur­vey’s Dr Smith says di­rect ob­ser­va­tion of the Antarc­tic ice sheet started in the 1970s, when satel­lite tech­nol­ogy made it pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Higher-qual­ity oceanic ob­ser­va­tions – col­lected through the use of high-tech struc­tures known as Argo floats, which are equipped with sen­sors that can de­tect tem­per­a­ture and salin­ity, among other pa­ram­e­ters – came later in the 1990s, he says.</p>
    <p>The Antarc­tic i ce sheet has changed through­out the cen­turies.</p>
    <p>But Dr Smith adds: “Go­ing back as far as we have records, the sim­ple re­sult of all th­ese stud­ies is that ice loss from Antarc­tica has in­creased over time and that the amount of ice lost con­tin­ues to get greater each year.”</p>
    <p>SEA-LEVEL RISE</p>
    <p>Antarc­tica is also not ex­empt from the ef­fects of heat ac­cu­mu­lat­ing in the at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>The burn­ing of fos­sil fu­els for en­ergy, or the clear­ing of forests for devel­op­ment or agri­cul­ture, re­leases heat-trap­ping gases like car­bon diox­ide into the at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>Such green­house gases are a global cur­rency, says Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity cli­mate sci­en­tist Win­ston Chow. They have the same im­pact on the global cli­mate, no mat­ter where they are emit­ted.</p>
    <p>And though trop­i­cal Sin­ga­pore could not be more dif­fer­ent from Antarc­tica, the fates of both re­gions are in­ter­twined closely.</p>
    <p>NTU’s Pro­fes­sor Hor­ton, who is from the univer­sity’s Earth Ob­ser­va­tory of Sin­ga­pore, says sea-level rise is a ma­jor threat for the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>There are two pro­cesses driv­ing it, he adds. Wa­ter ex­pands i n vol­ume when it is heated and the ther­mal ex­pan­sion of wa­ter was the main driver of sea-level rise in the 20th cen­tury, rais­ing lev­els at a rate of 2mm to 3mm a year, he says. But now, ris­ing sea lev­els are com­ing from ac­cel­er­at­ing rates of ice melt dump­ing wa­ter into the ocean.</p>
    <p>“What we’ve ob­served in the 21st cen­tury is the rate of sea-level rise has gone up to 3mm to 4mm a year. Ther­mal ex­pan­sion is still oc­cur­ring, but the ice sheets are now the dom­i­nant con­trib­u­tor to ris­ing sea lev­els.”</p>
    <p>The two ice sheets on the planet, Green­land and Antarc­tica, to­gether con­tain more than 99 per cent of fresh­wa­ter ice on earth, says the Na­tional Snow and Ice Data Cen­tre in the United States.</p>
    <p>The Antarc­tic ice sheet is the larger of the two, ex­tend­ing al­most 14 mil­lion sq km – roughly the area of the con­tigu­ous United States and Mex­ico com­bined, says the cen­tre on its web­site.</p>
    <p>“If all of Green­land is melted, it will con­trib­ute 6m to sea-level rise,” says Prof Hor­ton. But the im</p>
    <p>MELT­ING FASTER THAN EVER Ice loss from Antarc­tica has in­creased over time and the amount of ice lost con­tin­ues to get greater each year. ’’ DR ANDY SMITH, science leader of the ice dy­nam­ics and palaeo­cli­mate team at the Bri­tish Antarc­tic Sur­vey. Wedged be­tween a coast­line and a calv­ing glacier, the his­tor­i­cal site of Brown Sta­tion at Par­adise Bay will be one of the first to bear the ef­fects of sea-level rise.</p>
    <p>pact is much greater for Antarc­tica, he says. If the Antarc­tic ice sheet melts com­pletely, sea lev­els could go up by about 60m.</p>
    <p>It could take cen­turies for both ice sheets to melt com­pletely at the cur­rent rates of warm­ing, but Prof Hor­ton cau­tions that be­cause the Antarc­tic ice sheet is so mas­sive, only a small per­cent­age of it has to melt be­fore coast­lines around the world are af­fected.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, ci­ties such as the In­done­sian cap­i­tal of Jakarta are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing se­vere flood­ing events that can be linked to lo­cal fac­tors, such as land sub­si­dence from ground­wa­ter ex­trac­tion. But as is the case with many other ex­treme weather events around the world, cli­mate change just makes things worse. For Jakarta, ris­ing sea lev­els are lap­ping away at an al­ready sink­ing city.</p>
    <p>Two tiny is­lands in South Su­ma­tra have al­ready dis­ap­peared as a re­sult of ris­ing sea lev­els driven by cli­mate change, ac­cord­ing to en­vi­ron­men­tal group In­done­sian Fo­rum for the En­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>THE SIN­GA­PORE LINK</p>
    <p>Ear­lier es­ti­mates had in­di­cated that global mean sea lev­els could rise by up to 1m by 2100. But a sci­en­tific re­port re­leased by the In­ter­gov­ern­men­tal Panel on Cli­mate Change in Septem­ber last year in­di­cated that sea lev­els could rise faster than that.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial re­port on the oceans and cryosphere noted that if the amount of plan­et­warm­ing emis­sions re­mains high, sea-level rise in the cen­turies ahead could ex­ceed rates of sev­eral cen­time­tres a year, in­stead of the cur­rent in­crease mea­sured in mil­lime­tres a year.</p>
    <p>Prof Hor­ton says Sin­ga­pore might also ex­pe­ri­ence higher rates of sea-level rise than the global mean. “If an ice sheet melts, its grav­i­ta­tional at­trac­tion de­creases and sea lev­els around it can go down. Con­versely, re­gions far from a melt­ing ice sheet, such as Sin­ga­pore, will see a rise in sea level greater than the global av­er­age.”</p>
    <p>The Cen­tre for Cli­mate Re­search Sin­ga­pore says sea-level rise in trop­i­cal ar­eas could be as much as 30 per cent more than the global av­er­age.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment says: “This is a com­plex science and the cen­tre will be un­der­tak­ing more stud­ies to im­prove our un­der­stand­ing on the im­pact of mass loss from ice sheets in Green­land and Antarc­tica on sea lev­els in Sin­ga­pore and our re­gion.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is well aware of its vul­ner­a­bil­ity. The min­istry spokesman says the Repub­lic’s third na­tional cli­mate change study is ex­pected to be com­pleted by 2022.</p>
    <p>“Us­ing th­ese lat­est pro­jec­tions, we will then re­fine our adap­ta­tion plans, in­clud­ing our plans for coastal pro­tec­tion,” he adds. Such mea­sures could in­clude pumps, sea walls, recla­ma­tion, and/or pold­ers and dikes. Na­ture-based so­lu­tions will also be con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>He says: “Th­ese are all be­ing stud­ied and may need to be de­ployed to­gether to pre­vent flood­ing and in­un­da­tion from sea-level rise and more in­tense weather con­di­tions.”</p>
