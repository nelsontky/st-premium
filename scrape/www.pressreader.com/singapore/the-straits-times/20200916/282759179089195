    <p>You might think that in a car­toon se­ries in which beasts of awein­spir­ing size are a key at­trac­tion, the aim would be to make them as fan­tas­tic as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>But Colin Trevorrow, ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer of Juras­sic World: Camp Cre­ta­ceous, wants the op­po­site.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can film-maker wants the car­toon crea­tures to not look car­toon­ish.</p>
    <p>“We’re a fran­chise grounded in sci­ence, real sci­ence, and if we let go of that, we’d give up some­thing that makes us unique,” says Trevorrow, 43, to jour­nal­ists from South-east Asia in a vir­tual press con­fer­ence on Mon­day from his home in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>The an­i­mated se­ries will pre­miere on Fri­day on Net­flix. In the se­ries, six teenagers are in the camp of the ti­tle when the di­nosaur break­out of the 2015 film oc­curs. Un­less they use their wits, the teens will not make it to safety.</p>
    <p>The se­ries and the films share a com­mon uni­verse, with sto­ries that will be­come more in­ter­twined over time, he says.</p>
    <p>In the films, even when fic­tional an­i­mals ap­pear, such as the ter­ri­fy­ing man-made hy­brids In­do­rap­tor (Juras­sic World: Fallen King­dom, 2018) and In­domi­nus rex (Juras­sic World, 2015), they look to be within the realm of pos­si­bil­ity, he says.</p>
    <p>When the sci­ence is real, it serves to heighten an­other clas­sic el­e­ment of the fran­chise – the sense of ter­ror. The fear fac­tor will not be wa­tered down for the se­ries, he says.</p>
    <p>“Adults and chil­dren are in real dan­ger in the show. Death is un­ex­pected and un­earned,” he says.</p>
    <p>In most films, death comes as pun­ish­ment for the vil­lain, but di­nosaurs are an­i­mals and “an­i­mals are not con­scious of that, so good peo­ple are in as much dan­ger as bad peo­ple”, he says.</p>
    <p>Fac­ing fear might be some­thing chil­dren need, he adds.</p>
    <p>“We might be mak­ing hor­ror movies for chil­dren, but be­ing a kid is a scary thing.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s good to have kids get their fears out of their sys­tem in a cathar­tic way by see­ing the chil­dren in the show tri­umph over dan­ger.”</p>
    <p>He is fa­mil­iar with the Juras­sic fran­chise, hav­ing directed Juras­sic World, the fran­chise’s fourth movie, and was a writer on the fol­low-up, Juras­sic World: Fallen King­dom.</p>
    <p>He is a writer and di­rec­tor on the next film in the se­ries, Juras­sic World: Do­min­ion, to be re­leased next year.</p>
    <p>Trevorrow speaks about how he considers him­self a “cus­to­dian” of the fran­chise’s ideas, first ex­pressed in the 1990 novel by Michael Crich­ton and the first movie, Juras­sic Park (1993), directed by Steven Spiel­berg.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, the Juras­sic Park book and films were cau­tion­ary tales about tech­nol­ogy de­ployed with­out a moral com­pass.</p>
    <p>The Juras­sic World films of to­day de­pict the fall­out of the “poor de­ci­sions made in the 1990s”.</p>
    <p>“I find them to be rel­e­vant in a world that has to deal with cli­mate change and other dis­as­ters we are all try­ing to get through as a planet.”</p>
    <p>Like hu­mans are to­day, di­nosaurs were once the dom­i­nant species be­fore they van­ished.</p>
    <p>“Di­nosaurs are a re­minder of the need for hu­mil­ity,” he says.</p>
