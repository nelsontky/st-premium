    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina’s Se­nate voted yes­ter­day to le­galise abor­tion, a first for a big coun­try in Latin Amer­ica and a triumph for women’s rights cam­paign­ers achieved over the vis­ceral ob­jec­tion of the Catholic Church.</p>
    <p>Abor­tion is ex­tremely rare in a re­gion where the Church has held cul­tural and po­lit­i­cal sway for cen­turies. Pre­vi­ously, it was al­lowed on de­mand only in com­mu­nist Cuba, tiny Uruguay and parts of Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>The fiercely con­tentious vote was held at 4am after a marathon de­bate that lasted through the night. In a vote of 38-29 with one ab­sten­tion, the Se­nate backed the govern­ment pro­posal to al­low ter­mi­na­tions through the 14th week of preg­nancy. The Lower House had al­ready ap­proved it this month.</p>
    <p>As the re­sult was read out, a crowd of thou­sands of peo­ple who had sup­ported the Bill erupted in cheers out­side the Se­nate build­ing in Buenos Aires, wav­ing the green flags that rep­re­sented their cam­paign. Green smoke rose in the dawn light above the crowd.</p>
    <p>“This has been a strug­gle for many years, many women died. Never again will there be a woman killed in a clan­des­tine abor­tion,” said Ms Vilma Ibarra, the au­thor of the law and le­gal and tech­ni­cal sec­re­tary for the pres­i­dency, who wept as she spoke to re­porters.</p>
    <p>Ms Mon­ica Macha, a law­maker with Pres­i­dent Al­berto Fer­nan­dez’s cen­tre-left rul­ing coali­tion, tweeted: “We did it, sis­ters. We made his­tory. We did it to­gether. There are no words for this mo­ment, it passes through the body and the soul.”</p>
    <p>Mr Fer­nan­dez him­self re­acted mo­ments later: “Safe, le­gal and free abor­tion is law. To­day, we are a bet­ter so­ci­ety that broad­ens rights for women and guar­an­tees public health.”</p>
    <p>But Pope Fran­cis – him­self an Ar­gen­tinian – re­flected the church’s op­po­si­tion in his own tweet posted on Tues­day be­fore the Se­nate de­bate: “The son of God was born dis­carded to tell us that ev­ery per­son dis­carded is a child of God.”</p>
    <p>After the vote, thou­sands of the Bill’s op­po­nents dis­persed, wip­ing away tears as a speaker from a makeshift stage told them: “We are wit­ness­ing a de­feat of life. But our con­vic­tions do not change. We are go­ing to make our­selves heard.”</p>
    <p>One of them, Ms Sara de Avel­laneda, told Clarin news­pa­per: “I came be­cause I had to be here. We are not in­vis­i­ble. Not every­thing is a green tide. This law is un­con­sti­tu­tional and its im­ple­men­ta­tion is not go­ing to be easy.”</p>
    <p>The rul­ing could set the tone for a wider shift in con­ser­va­tive Latin Amer­ica where there are grow­ing calls for greater re­pro­duc­tive rights for women.</p>
    <p>“Adopt­ing a law that le­galises abor­tion in a Catholic coun­try as big as Ar­gentina will en­er­gise the strug­gle to en­sure women’s rights in Latin Amer­ica,” said Mr Juan Pap­pier, a se­nior re­searcher at Hu­man Rights Watch.</p>
    <p>“Although there will cer­tainly be re­sis­tance, I think it’s fair to pre­dict that, as it oc­curred when Ar­gentina le­galised same-sex mar­riage in 2010, this new law could have a domino ef­fect in the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>Un­til now, Ar­gen­tine law had al­lowed abor­tion only when there was a se­ri­ous risk to the health of the mother or in cases of rape.</p>
    <p>Pro-choice groups ar­gued that crim­i­nal­is­ing abor­tion harms women from the most vul­ner­a­ble groups. Ar­gentina’s Health Min­istry says more than 3,000 women died from il­le­gal abor­tions from 1983 to 2018.</p>
    <p>The Catholic Church ar­gues that abor­tion vi­o­lates the right to life.</p>
