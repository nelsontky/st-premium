    <p>WON’T AC­CEPT BI­DEN WIN</p>
    <p>The only way Bi­den can win Ari­zona is through fraud... I won’t ac­cept a Bi­den vic­tory. I don’t want to live un­der com­mu­nist rule.</p>
    <p>MR JIM WIL­LIAMS, a welder at a pro-Trump protest in Phoenix.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>(Ore­gon) Calling on elec­tion of­fi­cials to “count ev­ery vote”, protesters marched through the streets of sev­eral Amer­i­can cities in re­sponse to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ag­gres­sive ef­fort to chal­lenge the vote count in Tues­day’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In Min­neapo­lis, Minnesota, protesters blocked a free­way on Wed­nes­day, prompt­ing ar­rests. In Port­land, Ore­gon, hun­dreds gath­ered on the water­front to protest against the Pres­i­dent’s at­tempted in­ter­ven­tions in the vote count, as a sep­a­rate group protest­ing against the po­lice and urg­ing racial jus­tice smashed shop win­dows and con­fronted po­lice of­fi­cers and Na­tional Guard troops.</p>
    <p>US news net­works showed an ag­gres­sive pro-Trump crowd gath­er­ing out­side a vote count­ing of­fice in the im­por­tant Ari­zona county of Mari­copa, which in­cludes Phoenix.</p>
    <p>Burly law en­force­ment of­fi­cers formed a pro­tec­tive line at the fa­cil­ity’s doors.</p>
    <p>At sev­eral points, protesters con­tended that Mr Adrian Fontes, the county of­fi­cial who over­sees elec­tions in Mari­copa, was im­prop­erly fail­ing to count some bal­lots and cost­ing Mr Trump votes in Ari­zona’s most pop­u­lous county – although there was no ev­i­dence any bal­lots had been im­prop­erly tossed.</p>
    <p>Some protesters openly car­ried firearms, which is le­gal in the state, while peo­ple chanted “Count the votes!”</p>
    <p>An­other group of pro-Trump poll watch­ers gath­ered ear­lier out­side a bal­lot count­ing cen­tre in Detroit, Michi­gan, de­mand­ing that of­fi­cials “stop the count” af­ter the Trump cam­paign filed a suit to halt the count in the state.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump claimed early on Wed­nes­day that he had won the elec­tion, long be­fore key states had counted all their bal­lots. He spent</p>
    <p>much of the day as­sert­ing, with­out ev­i­dence, that peo­ple were try­ing to “steal” the elec­tion from him, and cast doubt on the le­git­i­macy of</p>
    <p>the many bal­lots sent through mail amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“It is such a dan­ger­ous mo­ment,” said Ms Carol Carmick, 59, who</p>
    <p>said she joined the protests in Port­land out of fears that Mr Trump would try to stay in power even if he lost the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>It was al­leged that the Jus­tice Depart­ment told fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors in an e-mail early on Wed­nes­day that the law al­lowed them to send armed fed­eral of­fi­cers to bal­lot count­ing lo­ca­tions around the coun­try to in­ves­ti­gate po­ten­tial voter fraud, ac­cord­ing to three peo­ple who de­scribed the mes­sage.</p>
    <p>The e-mail cre­ated the spec­tre of the fed­eral gov­ern­ment in­tim­i­dat­ing lo­cal elec­tion of­fi­cials or oth­er­wise in­ter­ven­ing in vote tal­ly­ing, former of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>A law pro­hibits the sta­tion­ing of armed fed­eral of­fi­cers at polls on elec­tion day. But a top of­fi­cial told pros­e­cu­tors that the depart­ment in­ter­preted the statute to mean that they could send armed fed­eral of­fi­cers to polling sta­tions and lo­ca­tions where bal­lots were be­ing counted any­time af­ter that.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, protesters also gath­ered in Philadel­phia, Los An­ge­les, Chicago and else­where, some of them con­tin­u­ing the protests over racial j us­tice and polic­ing that have rocked the coun­try since the po­lice killing of Mr Ge­orge Floyd in Min­neapo­lis in May. More demon­stra­tions were sched­uled for the com­ing days.</p>
    <p>In Min­neapo­lis, sev­eral hun­dred protesters, an­gered over the Pres­i­dent’s dec­la­ra­tions, marched onto In­ter­state 94, prompt­ing the po­lice to clear the high­way.</p>
    <p>In New York, protesters held a peace­ful demon­stra­tion in Man­hat­tan ear­lier on Wed­nes­day calling for ev­ery vote to be counted and for racial equal­ity. But hos­tile clashes be­tween protesters and the po­lice de­vel­oped later when protesters briefly shut down traf­fic in West Vil­lage, and of­fi­cers pushed protesters to the side­walks and ar­rested at least 20 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>At the pro-Trump event i n Phoenix, at least 150 peo­ple gath­ered in front of the state Capi­tol be­fore march­ing to the Mari­copa County Recorder’s Of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mr Jim Wil­liams, 67, a welder at the protest, said: “The only way Bi­den can win Ari­zona is through fraud. I won’t ac­cept a Bi­den vic­tory. I don’t want to live un­der com­mu­nist rule.”</p>
