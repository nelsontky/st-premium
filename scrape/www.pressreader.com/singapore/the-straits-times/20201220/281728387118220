    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Boe­ing of­fi­cials “in­ap­pro­pri­ately coached” test pilots dur­ing re­cer­ti­fi­ca­tion ef­forts af­ter two fa­tal 737 Max crashes killed 346 peo­ple, ac­cord­ing to a lengthy United States con­gres­sional re­port re­leased on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The re­port from the Se­nate Com­merce Com­mit­tee’s Repub­li­can staff raised ques­tions about whether test­ing this year of a key safety sys­tem known as MCAS (ma­noeu­vring char­ac­ter­is­tics aug­men­ta­tion sys­tem), which was tied to both crashes, was con­trary to proper pro­to­col.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee con­cluded that Fed­eral Aviation Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FAA) and Boe­ing of­fi­cials “had es­tab­lished a pre­de­ter­mined out­come to reaf­firm a long-held hu­man fac­tor as­sump­tion re­lated to pi­lot re­ac­tion time... It ap­pears, in this in­stance, FAA and Boe­ing were at­tempt­ing to cover up im­por­tant in­for­ma­tion that may have con­trib­uted to the 737 Max tragedies”.</p>
    <p>The re­port cited a whistle­blower who al­leged that Boe­ing of­fi­cials en­cour­aged test pilots to “re­mem­ber, get right on that pickle switch” prior to the ex­er­cise that re­sulted in pi­lot re­ac­tion in ap­prox­i­mately four sec­onds, while an­other pi­lot in a sep­a­rate test re­acted in ap­prox­i­mately 16 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>The ac­count was cor­rob­o­rated dur­ing an FAA staff in­ter­view, the com­mit­tee said.</p>
    <p>Nu­mer­ous re­ports have found that Boe­ing failed to ad­e­quately con­sider how pilots re­spond to cock­pit emer­gen­cies in its de­vel­op­ment of the 737 Max.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing said on Fri­day that it takes se­ri­ously the com­mit­tee’s find­ings and will con­tinue to re­view the re­port in full.</p>
    <p>The FAA said on Fri­day it was “care­fully re­view­ing the doc­u­ment, which the com­mit­tee ac­knowl­edges con­tains a num­ber of un­sub­stan­ti­ated al­le­ga­tions”.</p>
    <p>The agency added it is “con­fi­dent that the safety is­sues that played a role in the tragic (737 Max) ac­ci­dents in­volv­ing Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Air­lines Flight 302 have been ad­dressed through the de­sign changes re­quired and in­de­pen­dently ap­proved by the FAA and its part­ners”.</p>
    <p>Se­nate Com­merce Com­mit­tee chair­man Roger Wicker said the re­port “de­tails a num­ber of sig­nif­i­cant ex­am­ples of lapses in aviation safety over­sight and failed lead­er­ship in the FAA”.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee also said “mul­ti­ple in­de­pen­dent whis­tle-blow­ers con­tacted the com­mit­tee to al­lege FAA se­nior man­age­ment was com­plicit in de­ter­min­ing the 737 Max train­ing cer­ti­fi­ca­tion level prior to any eval­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing re­sisted re­quir­ing sim­u­la­tor train­ing for pilots be­fore op­er­at­ing the 737 Max, but re­versed course in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The re­port also noted that South­west Air­lines was able to op­er­ate more than 150,000 flights, car­ry­ing 17.2 mil­lion pas­sen­gers, with­out con­fir­ma­tion that re­quired main­te­nance had been com­pleted for the jets. The re­port said the flights put millions of pas­sen­gers at po­ten­tial risk.</p>
    <p>South­west said on Fri­day it was aware of the re­port and added that “we do not tol­er­ate any re­lax­ing of stan­dards that gov­ern ul­ti­mate safety across our oper­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing faces an on­go­ing crim­i­nal probe into the 737 Max.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee said its re­view was con­strained due to the con­tin­u­ing crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Last month, the FAA ap­proved the 737 Max’s re­turn to ser­vice, and flights have re­sumed in Brazil. The first US 737 Max com­mer­cial flight with pay­ing pas­sen­gers is set for Dec 29.</p>
    <p>The Se­nate com­mit­tee last month unan­i­mously passed a Bill to re­form how FAA cer­ti­fies new air­planes and to grant new pro­tec­tions for whis­tle-blow­ers, among other re­forms, while the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives unan­i­mously passed a sim­i­lar Bill.</p>
