    <p>So many stay­cays, so lit­tle time. What makes this ho­tel spe­cial?</p>
    <p>The crown jewel of the three ho­tels – the other two be­ing Vil­lage Ho­tel and The Out­post Ho­tel – owned by Far East Hos­pi­tal­ity group on Sen­tosa, The Bar­racks Ho­tel has a stately grandeur, thanks to its colo­nial-era ar­chi­tec­ture and sto­ried his­tory.</p>
    <p>It was built in 1904 and be­gan life as the Blakang Mati Ar­tillery Bar­racks (Sen­tosa’s old Malay name mean­ing “the is­land of death be­hind”) back when the is­land was a Bri­tish mil­i­tary out­post.</p>
    <p>The six her­itage build­ings housed not just quar­ters for mil­i­tary per­son­nel, but also other fa­cil­i­ties such as store­rooms, a cook­house and a small cin­ema. There was even a pa­rade square.</p>
    <p>Two of the build­ings have now been re­pur­posed into the five-star Bar­racks Ho­tel, one into an events cen­tre and the rest into Mess Hall, which houses a con­ve­nience store and sev­eral restau­rants, in­clud­ing Hide­masa by Hide Ya­mamoto (Ja­panese), Royal Taj (In­dian), Quentin’s (Eurasian), Le Faubourg (French) and Lady M, the up­scale cake bou­tique from New York.</p>
    <p>The grounds are stun­ning, with a ver­dant, beau­ti­fully man­i­cured lawn lined with ma­jes­tic palm trees. At night, skil­ful mood light­ing makes the whole place dream­ily ro­man­tic.</p>
    <p>First im­pres­sions?</p>
    <p>Some­times, it’s the lit­tle things that open the flood­gates of mem­o­ries and long­ing you don’t know you have sup­pressed.</p>
    <p>On this swel­ter­ing Tues­day af­ter­noon, it was the po­litely prof­fered chilled face towel and the cold welcome drink – a re­fresh­ing con­coc­tion of iced black tea, grape­fruit juice and nut­meg syrup named The Bar­racks Spritz – that trig­gered a kalei­do­scope of flash­backs.</p>
    <p>I thought of the hun­dreds of times I had checked into ho­tels – posh, pedes­trian, squalid – and the dif­fer­ent welcome bev­er­ages – de­li­cious, pu­trid, meh – I had im­bibed over decades of gal­li­vant­ing around the world and how much I missed them.</p>
    <p>Frankly, there was noth­ing to sug­gest I was not on hol­i­day. I was on an is­land, sip­ping a nec­tarous cock­tail, sit­ting on a hand­some leather Ch­ester­field in the lobby of a posh rein­car­na­tion of what was once a Bri­tish ar­tillery base.</p>
    <p>Not stan­dard-is­sue at all. Your low-down on the bunk?</p>
    <p>My room had a huge bed, state-ofthe-art “salut­ing” Ja­panese toi­let and an invit­ing roll-top bath­tub tak­ing cen­tre stage, like a gi­ant sculp­ture.</p>
    <p>It ex­uded vin­tage chic, thanks to the wood pan­elling and floor­ing, ex­posed tim­ber beams, pati­nated metal fit­tings and colo­nial­style fur­ni­ture fash­ioned from leather and can­vas, in­clud­ing a leather-clad mini-bar trunk.</p>
    <p>On the work desk, the ho­tel staff had thought­fully placed, among other things, a bot­tle of Somer­ton Caber­net Sau­vi­gnon, a tube of vi­ta­min C tablets, a small bag of mac­arons and a teddy bear clad in a sa­fari suit.</p>
    <p>The room opened to a pa­tio lead­ing to a small pri­vate jacuzzi and one of the ho­tel’s two lap pools. Be­cause oc­cu­pancy at the prop­erty – which has just 40 rooms, in­clud­ing six suites – was capped at 50 per cent, there was no need to book a slot for a swim.</p>
    <p>So, what else is there to do at The Bar­racks?</p>
    <p>De­cid­ing to ex­plore what else the place had to of­fer, I scanned the QR code from a ho­tel map for a self­guided tour of the prop­erty.</p>
    <p>Tour done, I headed to The Liv­ing Room, the ho­tel’s ex­clu­sive din­ing lounge, flanked by a swim­ming pool, for tea.</p>
    <p>The friendly waiter set­tled me in with a glass of cold Lau­rent Per­rier bub­bly be­fore bring­ing a three-tier bird cage af­ter­noon-tea snack stand filled with sand­wiches, an as­sort­ment of cakes, and scones with whipped cream and mar­malade.</p>
    <p>He then took me through the be­spoke tea pro­gramme – cu­rated by The Tea Tailor by Pryce, an award­win­ning Sin­ga­pore tea com­pany – and helped me pick my tea base (uji sen­cha) and two fruit pair­ings (Ja­vanese ginger and Thai lemon­grass).</p>
    <p>Fancy. What is mil­i­tary grub like?</p>
    <p>Barely three hours later – af­ter a snooze, dur­ing which I dreamt of (god knows why) marsh­mal­lows and mon­i­tor lizards – I was back, stuff­ing my face with gar­gan­tuan fried won­tons, var­i­ous cheeses and a gin-in­fused ver­sion of The Bar­racks Spritz.</p>
    <p>My stom­ach protested against the idea of din­ner, so I did a bit of work, read a lit­tle and had a long soak in the Apaiser bath­tub be­fore turn­ing in for the night.</p>
    <p>I or­dered nasi lemak for break­fast the next day and was told it was one of the most re­quested items on the menu. It was an elab­o­rate af­fair – a fried egg crown­ing a bowl of co­conut rice, curry chicken, prawn sam­bal, sam­bal tu­mis, peanut and an­chovies – but I was al­ready more than half full when it ar­rived, be­cause of the ap­pe­tis­ers that came be­fore it: a char siew puff, a slice of radish cake and an egg tart.</p>
    <p>Any other army ad­ven­tures?</p>
    <p>The next day, I was off to One15 Ma­rina for my Break­fast Sail with yacht op­er­a­tor Xim­ula, owned by mar­ried celebrity cou­ple Dar­ren Lim and Eve­lyn Tan.</p>
    <p>It is an op­tional add-on ex­cur­sion, which the ho­tel can ar­range in ad­vance. It costs $800++ for up to five peo­ple, per cur­rent gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>I felt like a towkay be­cause I had Grace­fully – a 40-foot (12.2m) sail­ing cata­ma­ran with three cab­ins – to my­self.</p>
    <p>Filipino skip­per Vic­tor Faustino and crew mem­ber Wong Mingqi took good care of me and kept me en­ter­tained with easy ban­ter as we cruised along the South­ern Is­lands be­fore an­chor­ing at Lazarus Is­land, where I took a dip in the warm wa­ters and lolled around a float­ing plat­form.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore Covid, the is­land was usu­ally empty. Now peo­ple go there with tents, it’s crazy,” Mr Faustino said, re­fer­ring to news reports about peo­ple break­ing safe dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions by gath­er­ing in groups of more than five. “Peo­ple are just dy­ing to get out.”</p>
    <p>We spent three hours out at sea, with a leisurely cruise along the Ma­rina Bay area to take in the city sky­line as a fi­nale.</p>
    <p>Verdict: Bliss or miss?</p>
    <p>The price is steep, but if it is not an is­sue: bliss. His­tory, her­itage, lux­ury digs, at­ten­tive ser­vice, good food, yummy cock­tails, sun, sand and sea – what is there to diss?</p>
