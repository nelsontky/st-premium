    <p>Smaller firms will be able to file taxes more eas­ily this year, with new ini­tia­tives rolled out by the In­land Rev­enue Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (Iras), it said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>These in­clude a sim­pli­fied tax form, called Form C-S (Lite), with fewer fields to fill in, and a sys­tem that al­lows di­rect fil­ing from the firms’ ac­count­ing soft­ware.</p>
    <p>Iras is also set to com­mence digi­tised no­tices for com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Firms with an an­nual rev­enue of $200,000 or be­low can use the new form, sub­ject to other cri­te­ria – which trans­lates to around 60,000 small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) ben­e­fit­ing from it this year.</p>
    <p>It re­quires firms with straight­for­ward tax mat­ters to com­plete only six es­sen­tial fields, such as their rev­enue and net profit or loss – a third of the fields they pre­vi­ously had to fill. These com­pa­nies will also be ex­empt from sub­mit­ting their fi­nan­cial state­ments and tax com­pu­ta­tions, but should still pre­pare these doc­u­ments in case Iras re­quests them.</p>
    <p>With more tax pro­ce­dures go­ing dig­i­tal, com­pa­nies can also pay their taxes us­ing PayNow QR and get real-time up­dates on any out­stand­ing bal­ances.</p>
    <p>From the mid­dle of next year, Iras will also in­tro­duce PayNow Cor­po­rate as a new e-re­fund op­tion for firms, on top of Giro and tele­graphic trans­fers. This means com­pa­nies will be able to re­ceive their tax refunds within seven days from the credit aris­ing.</p>
    <p>To be el­i­gi­ble for this re­fund mode, firms must link their Unique En­tity Num­ber to their cor­po­rate bank ac­count via In­ter­net bank­ing.</p>
    <p>Iras in Au­gust in­tro­duced a dig­i­tal so­lu­tion in­cor­po­rated into ded­i­cated ac­count­ing soft­ware, which will al­low SMEs with an­nual rev­enue of $5 mil­lion or be­low to seam­lessly file their taxes to Iras and their an­nual re­turns to the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity (Acra). The soft­ware au­to­mates the prepa­ra­tion and fil­ing of statu­tory re­turns, and saves the firms time while min­imis­ing re­port­ing er­rors.</p>
    <p>Iras and Acra part­nered ac­count­ing soft­ware providers to in­cor­po­rate reg­u­la­tory fil­ing re­quire­ments into their soft­ware. The dig­i­tal so­lu­tion is now avail­able with Ne­ti­quette O2O Busi­ness Suite and SMECEN soft­ware, and will even­tu­ally be in­cor­po­rated into Au­toCount Ac­count­ing, Deskera ERP and Real­timme Cloud Solutions.</p>
    <p>Some 200,000 SMEs can po­ten­tially ben­e­fit from this en­hanced soft­ware, which firms can tap the Pro­duc­tiv­ity Solutions Grant to pur­chase.</p>
    <p>“By digi­tis­ing their fi­nan­cial records through an ac­count­ing soft­ware, SMEs can also en­sure that they have con­ve­nient ac­cess to es­sen­tial in­for­ma­tion re­quired to make ef­fec­tive busi­ness de­ci­sions,” Iras said.</p>
    <p>Iras will also phase out pa­per no­tices and en­sure that most no­tices will be digi­tised from May next year. This will al­low firms to in­stantly ac­cess no­tices any time, re­ceive e-mail no­ti­fi­ca­tions when a no­tice is ready for view­ing and see the past three years’ worth of no­tices on­line.</p>
    <p>E-fil­ing is com­pul­sory from this year, and all com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing those with no busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties or those in a loss po­si­tion, have to e-file their cor­po­rate in­come tax re­turns by Dec 15.</p>
    <p>E-fil­ing be­gan in 2018 and was rolled out in phases. This year, more than 170,000 com­pa­nies that were not in the pre­vi­ous com­pul­sory e-fil­ing groups are re­quired to do so.</p>
