    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween the United States and China – over­all and in the South China Sea in par­tic­u­lar – are rapidly de­te­ri­o­rat­ing. The two coun­tries are es­ca­lat­ing the sit­u­a­tion and a mil­i­tary clash is a dis­tinct pos­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>In­deed, they seem locked in a duel driven by mu­tual dis­trust in which each claim to be re­spond­ing to the other and nei­ther wants to make the first move to de-es­ca­late. The larger and broader dy­namic seems un­man­age­able at the mo­ment. How­ever, in the short term, there are smaller steps that can be taken to avoid a clash.</p>
    <p>The South China Sea is at the crux of their strate­gic con­test for re­gional dom­i­nance.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent US ap­proach there seems to be to “meet China’s greater as­sertive­ness with a more as­sertive use of force of its own”. Ac­cord­ing to US De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper, the US is ag­gres­sively build­ing “the ca­pa­bil­i­ties that we need to de­ter China from com­mit­ting to a ma­jor con­fronta­tion”.</p>
    <p>As US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re-election chances wane and he be­comes des­per­ate, an at­tempt to unite the coun­try be­hind him by con­fronting China and even risk­ing a “con­trolled clash” can­not be ruled out.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are dan­ger­ous dy­nam­ics and there are sev­eral ob­vi­ous “red lines” for both sides in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>For China, the South China Sea pro­vides rel­a­tive “sanc­tu­ary” for its re­tal­ia­tory-strike nuclear sub­marines based in Yulin on Hainan.</p>
    <p>Th­ese sub­marines are its in­sur­ance against a first strike – some­thing the US – un­like China – has not dis­avowed. Thus, the pos­si­bil­ity of a first strike is an ex­is­ten­tial threat to China and an ad­van­tage for the US in mil­i­tary strat­egy – and co­er­cion.</p>
    <p>The US uses in­tel­li­gence, sur­veil­lance and re­con­nais­sance (ISR) probes in the South China Sea to de­tect, track and, if nec­es­sary, tar­get China’s nuclear sub­marines. China’s re­sponse has been to de­velop on some of the fea­tures it oc­cu­pies the ca­pa­bil­ity to neu­tralise the US’ ISR probes in a time of con­flict.</p>
    <p>For China, its in­stal­la­tions are im­por­tant to its con­tin­ued ex­is­tence and it is not about to uni­lat­er­ally com­pro­mise this de­fence. But the US be­lieves it needs to con­tinue its in­tel­li­gence probes be­cause they give it an over­all strate­gic nuclear ad­van­tage over China.</p>
    <p>So, for China, any US move to sig­nif­i­cantly di­min­ish th­ese de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties would likely be a “red line”.</p>
    <p>For the US, a cor­re­spond­ing “red line” might well be any se­ri­ous at­tempt to dis­rupt its ISR probes.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther wants war – es­pe­cially a nuclear war – and that serves as a de­ter­rent to cross­ing th­ese “red lines”.</p>
    <p>But there are other prob­a­ble “red lines” that China should not cross. For the US, this would in­clude bla­tant vi­o­la­tions of com­mer­cial free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion or an at­tack on the forces or ter­ri­tory of its ally, the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>This is pri­mar­ily be­cause a non-re­sponse by the US would de­stroy its cred­i­bil­ity as the “leader” and pro­tec­tor of the “in­ter­na­tional or­der” and the re­gion.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Sec­re­tary of State David Stil­well has de­clared any at­tempt by China to oc­cupy and build on the Philip­pines-claimed Scar­bor­ough Shoal as a “red line”. China’s dec­la­ra­tion of an air de­fence iden­ti­fi­ca­tion zone over a large swathe of dis­puted wa­ters in the South China Sea might not in it­self be cross­ing a “red line”, al­though an at­tempt to en­force it would likely be so.</p>
    <p>For China, whose body politic has be­come in­creas­ingly na­tion­al­is­tic, any na­tional loss of face and re­sul­tant loss of re­spect for lead­er­ship could trig­ger a crossed “red line” re­sponse. This might in­clude a US mil­i­tary con­fronta­tion that forces a pub­lic climb­down by China’s Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army Navy.</p>
    <p>It would also in­clude any of sev­eral bel­liger­ent ac­tions that have been pro­posed, such as us­ing mil­i­tary power to block­ade China’s fea­tures or even forc­ing Chi­nese forces off them.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are some of the more ob­vi­ous “red lines” that both should avoid. There are pre­sum­ably oth­ers known best to their mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence com­mu­ni­ties. The two should com­mu­ni­cate their “red lines” and the rea­sons for them.</p>
    <p>Asean coun­tries could con­trib­ute to con­flict avoid­ance by in­di­vid­u­ally or prefer­ably mul­ti­lat­er­ally ex­press­ing op­po­si­tion to the US and Chi­nese mil­i­tary pres­ence.</p>
    <p>There has been some move­ment in this di­rec­tion. Sin­ga­pore, the Philip­pines, Malaysia and In­done­sia have in­di­vid­u­ally ex­pressed their con­cerns. But so far, the voic­ing of th­ese con­cerns has not had the de­sired ef­fect. How­ever, an es­ca­lat­ing and strength­en­ing cho­rus of con­cern could help re­duce the po­ten­tial for con­flict and con­fronta­tion.</p>
    <p>If the two pro­tag­o­nists be­gin to heed th­ese pleas, an­other small step would be for China and the US to im­prove their mil­i­tary-to-mil­i­tary com­mu­ni­ca­tion so that nei­ther side is sur­prised or “threat­ened” to the point that an un­in­tended clash oc­curs.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral com­mu­ni­ca­tion mech­a­nisms al­ready ex­ist – at least on pa­per – and rein­vig­o­rat­ing them would seem a log­i­cal step. Mr Esper wants to visit China soon to “es­tab­lish the sys­tems nec­es­sary for cri­sis com­mu­ni­ca­tion”. China’s For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi agrees that a dis­cus­sion is needed for a “list of is­sues that need proper man­age­ment”.</p>
    <p>If ef­fec­tive, th­ese small steps could over time lead to a larger tac­ti­cal bar­gain.</p>
    <p>China might re­frain from fur­ther oc­cu­pa­tion, con­struc­tion and “mil­i­tari­sa­tion” on its claimed fea­tures. It would also not un­der­take any provoca­tive ac­tion like oc­cu­py­ing and build­ing on Scar­bor­ough Shoal, ha­rass­ing other claimants in their claimed ex­clu­sive economic zones and declar­ing an air de­fence iden­ti­fi­ca­tion zone over dis­puted wa­ters.</p>
    <p>The US, in turn, would de­crease or cease al­to­gether its provoca­tive free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tions there and its “close-in” ISR probes.</p>
    <p>In the end, for a sta­ble peace, both will have to share. The US would have to share power with China in the re­gion. And China would have to share the sea’s re­sources and their man­age­ment with its ri­val claimants. But this is a long way off – if ever.</p>
    <p>Since, in the short term, com­pro­mise ap­pears to be out of reach, the two na­tions have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to their peo­ple, the re­gion and the world to do what they can to avoid a clash – as­sum­ing that they want to do so.</p>
    <p>Reach­ing a mu­tual un­der­stand­ing of each other’s</p>
    <p>“red lines” is the least they can do. By mak­ing clear their “red lines”, they will be giv­ing con­flict avoid­ance a chance.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, small steps such as a broader and more ro­bust Asean voice of con­cern and re­vi­talised US-China mil­i­tary-to mil­i­tary com­mu­ni­ca­tion might help sta­bilise the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
