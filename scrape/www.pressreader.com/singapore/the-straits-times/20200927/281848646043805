    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has said Amer­i­cans might not know the win­ner of the Novem­ber pres­i­den­tial elec­tion for months due to dis­putes over mail bal­lots, build­ing on his crit­i­cism of a method that could be used by half of Amer­i­can vot­ers this year.</p>
    <p>Elec­tion ex­perts have said it might take sev­eral days af­ter the Nov 3 vote un­til a win­ner is known as of­fi­cials will need time to count mail bal­lots that ar­rive af­ter elec­tion day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a rally in New­port News, Vir­ginia, Mr Trump on Friday said he would pre­fer to find out quickly whether he won or lost, rather than wait for the mail bal­lots to come in.</p>
    <p>“I like watch­ing tele­vi­sion and have, ‘The win­ner is’, right? You might not hear it for months, be­cause this is a mess,” he said. “It’s very un­likely that you’re go­ing to hear a win­ner that night. I could be lead­ing and then they’ll just keep get­ting bal­lots, and bal­lots, and bal­lots and bal­lots. Be­cause now they’re say­ing the bal­lots can come in late.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s re­fusal to com­mit to a peace­ful trans­fer of power has led to con­cerns about whether he might or­der US troops into any chaos around the com­ing elec­tions.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve deeply in the prin­ci­ple of an apo­lit­i­cal US mil­i­tary,” Gen­eral Mark Mil­ley, chair­man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in writ­ten an­swers to ques­tions from law­mak­ers re­leased last month. “In the event of a dis­pute over some as­pect of the elec­tions, by law, US courts and the US Congress are re­quired to re­solve any dis­putes, not the US mil­i­tary.”</p>
    <p>But that has not stopped an in­ten­si­fy­ing de­bate in the mil­i­tary about its role should a dis­puted elec­tion lead to civil un­rest.</p>
    <p>On Aug 11, re­tired army of­fi­cers John Nagl and Paul Yin­gling, both Iraq War vet­er­ans, pub­lished an open let­ter to Gen Mil­ley on the web­site De­fence One. “In a few months’ time, you may have to choose be­tween de­fy­ing a law­less pres­i­dent or be­tray­ing your con­sti­tu­tional oath,” they wrote. “If Don­ald Trump re­fuses to leave of­fice at the ex­pi­ra­tion of his con­sti­tu­tional term, the United States mil­i­tary must re­move him by force, and you must give that or­der.”</p>
    <p>Pen­tagon of­fi­cials swiftly said such an out­come was pre­pos­ter­ous. Un­der no cir­cum­stances, they said, would the chair­man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff send Navy Seals or Marines to haul Mr Trump out of the White House. If nec­es­sary, such a task, De­fence Depart­ment of­fi­cials said, would fall to US Mar­shals or the Se­cret Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Opin­ion polls show that more Democrats than Repub­li­cans plan to vote by mail to avoid ex­po­sure to Covid-19 in crowded polling places. Mr Trump’s cam­paign has filed law­suits in sev­eral states to re­strict mail bal­lot­ing.</p>
    <p>NO IM­ME­DI­ATE RE­SULTS</p>
    <p>I like watch­ing tele­vi­sion and have, ‘The win­ner is’, right? You might not hear it for months, be­cause this is a mess... It’s very un­likely that you’re go­ing to hear a win­ner that night.</p>
    <p>MR DON­ALD TRUMP,</p>
