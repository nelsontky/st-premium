    <p>PARIS • Peo­ple who eat a lot of in­dus­tri­ally pro­cessed junk food are more likely to ex­hibit a change in their chro­mo­somes linked to age­ing, ac­cord­ing to re­search pre­sented last week at an on­line med­i­cal con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Three or more serv­ings of so­called “ul­tra-pro­cessed food” a day dou­bled the odds that strands of DNA and pro­teins called telom­eres, found on the end of chro­mo­somes, would be shorter com­pared with peo­ple who rarely con­sumed such foods, sci­en­tists re­ported at the Euro­pean and In­ter­na­tional Con­fer­ence on Obe­sity.</p>
    <p>Short telom­eres are a marker of bi­o­log­i­cal age­ing at the cel­lu­lar level and the study sug­gests that diet is a fac­tor in driv­ing the cells to age faster.</p>
    <p>While the cor­re­la­tion is strong, how­ever, the causal re­la­tion­ship be­tween eat­ing highly pro­cessed foods and di­min­ished telom­eres re­mains spec­u­la­tive, the au­thors cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>Each hu­man cell has 23 pairs of chro­mo­somes that con­tain a per­son’s ge­netic code.</p>
    <p>Telom­eres do not carry ge­netic in­for­ma­tion, but are vi­tal for pre­serv­ing the sta­bil­ity and in­tegrity of chro­mo­somes and, by ex­ten­sion, the DNA that all the cells in the body re­lies on to func­tion.</p>
    <p>As peo­ple get older, their telom­eres shorten nat­u­rally be­cause each time a cell di­vides, part of the telom­ere is lost. That re­duc­tion in length has long been recog­nised as a marker of bi­o­log­i­cal age.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists led by pro­fes­sors Maira Bes-Ras­trollo and Amelia Marti, both of the Univer­sity of Navarra in Spain, wanted to ex­plore a sus­pected con­nec­tion be­tween the reg­u­lar con­sump­tion of highly pro­cessed junk food and shrink­ing telom­eres.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier stud­ies had pointed to a pos­si­ble link with su­gar-sweet­ened drinks, pro­cessed meats and other foods loaded with sat­u­rated fats and su­gar, but the find­ings were in­con­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>Ul­tra-pro­cessed foods are in­dus­tri­ally man­u­fac­tured sub­stances com­posed of some mix of oils, fats, sug­ars, starch and pro­teins that con­tain lit­tle, if any, whole or nat­u­ral foods.</p>
    <p>They of­ten in­clude ar­ti­fi­cial flavour­ings, colour­ings, emul­si­fiers, preser­va­tives and other ad­di­tives that in­crease shelf-life and profit mar­gins.</p>
    <p>These same prop­er­ties, how­ever, also mean that such foods are nu­tri­tion­ally poor com­pared with less pro­cessed al­ter­na­tives, the re­searchers said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier stud­ies have shown strong cor­re­la­tions be­tween ul­tra-pro­cessed foods and hy­per­ten­sion, obe­sity, de­pres­sion, type 2 di­a­betes and some forms of can­cer.</p>
    <p>These con­di­tions are of­ten agere­lated in so far as they are linked to ox­ida­tive stress and in­flam­ma­tion known to in­flu­ence telom­ere length.</p>
    <p>Prof Marti and her col­leagues looked at health data for nearly 900 peo­ple aged 55 or older, who pro­vided DNA sam­ples in 2008 and gave de­tailed data about their eat­ing habits ev­ery two years there­after.</p>
    <p>The 645 men and 241 women were equally di­vided into four groups, de­pend­ing on their con­sump­tion of ul­tra-pro­cessed foods.</p>
    <p>Those in the high-in­take group were more likely to have a fam­ily his­tory of car­dio­vas­cu­lar dis­ease, di­a­betes and ab­nor­mal blood fats.</p>
    <p>They also con­sumed less foods as­so­ci­ated with the Mediter­ranean diet – fi­bre, olive oil, fruit, veg­eta­bles and nuts.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with the group who ate the fewest ul­tra-pro­cessed foods, the other three showed an in­creased like­li­hood – 29, 40 and 82 per cent, re­spec­tively – of hav­ing short­ened telom­eres.</p>
    <p>The find­ings were pub­lished ear­lier this year in the peer-re­viewed Amer­i­can Jour­nal of Clin­i­cal Nu­tri­tion.</p>
