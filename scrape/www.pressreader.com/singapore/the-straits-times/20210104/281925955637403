    <p>En­tre­pre­neur or em­ployee – which one holds the key to South-east Asia’s growth at a time of rapid change? This is the sec­ond ar­ti­cle of a four-part se­ries, The Edges Of South-east Asia, that shines a light on the bright spots of cre­ativ­ity and in­no­va­tion in the re­gion. A joint project of Deloitte, the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board and the US-Asean Busi­ness Coun­cil, the ar­ti­cles fo­cus each week on a spe­cific ‘edge’ or cus­tomer seg­ment, ge­o­graphic mar­ket or prod­uct that of­fers high growth po­ten­tial op­por­tu­ni­ties in Asean.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, Dat was a long-serv­ing em­ployee of a large multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tion. He was proud of his job. He had worked hard to get where he was – a fact he of­ten re­minded his cousins, who did not study as hard as he did at school. They ended up in odd jobs and run­ning their own small busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Dat’s cousins are typ­i­cal of his com­pa­tri­ots. In the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion, the in­for­mal econ­omy ac­counts for nearly 60 per cent of non-farm em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>In­for­mal em­ploy­ment ex­ists out of ne­ces­sity. It is of­ten a pre­car­i­ous way of mak­ing a liv­ing. Work­ers are less pro­tected by reg­u­la­tion than tra­di­tional full-time em­ploy­ees. They do not have ac­cess to pen­sion plans and they are more at risk of los­ing their jobs.</p>
    <p>The tra­di­tional approach of South-east Asian gov­ern­ments to help these more vul­ner­a­ble work­ers has been to fo­cus on cre­at­ing more jobs within the gov­ern­ment, state-owned en­ter­prises and multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the pan­demic has high­lighted the vul­ner­a­bil­ity of the liveli­hoods of so many peo­ple, and we, as a re­gion, need to take a fresh approach.</p>
    <p>FROM JOBS TO IN­COME</p>
    <p>Dat, for ex­am­ple, found him­self un­em­ployed and without an in­come, while his cousins were left rel­a­tively un­scathed. Putting his ego aside, he called one of his cousins for ad­vice. He sighed at the list of sug­ges­tions: de­liver food, start a busi­ness sell­ing masks, pri­vately tu­tor stu­dents and the like. Yet, he knew he had to do some­thing.</p>
    <p>So Dat made his first foray into the gig econ­omy: He be­came a Grab driver. This al­lowed him to make just enough money for his fam­ily’s daily ex­penses. But he knew it was not a long-term so­lu­tion. He had al­ways been a keen baker so, with the en­cour­age­ment of his wife, he also started a busi­ness sell­ing his de­li­cious muffins on­line.</p>
    <p>Dat’s story shows that one so­lu­tion for a more re­silient econ­omy has al­ways been in our midst – en­trepreneur­ship. Over the past decade, tech­nol­ogy has low­ered the bar­ri­ers to en­try for many sec­tors while cre­at­ing new av­enues for en­trepreneur­s to flour­ish.</p>
    <p>More­over, en­trepreneur­s can spur even more en­trepreneur­ship when they cre­ate plat­forms – such as Grab and Shopee – that can sup­port and ac­cel­er­ate more en­tre­pre­neur­ial growth.</p>
    <p>These trends show how the re­gion’s econ­omy is chang­ing and how peo­ple like Dat are re­ly­ing more on tech­nol­ogy plat­forms and en­trepreneur­ship for their liveli­hoods and less on multi­na­tional and gov­ern­ment or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>To sup­port this shift, gov­ern­ments must fo­cus less on the old par­a­digms of job cre­ation and more on in­come gen­er­a­tion by de­vel­op­ing bet­ter reg­u­la­tory struc­tures and safety nets.</p>
    <p>FROM EM­PLOY­EES TO EN­TREPRENEUR­S</p>
    <p>Be­ing an en­tre­pre­neur may not of­fer the in­come sta­bil­ity that comes with em­ploy­ment in a large or­gan­i­sa­tion. But as the world en­ters an era of con­stant dis­rup­tion and whole in­dus­tries are in­creas­ingly sus­cep­ti­ble to large-scale change, tra­di­tion­ally sta­ble jobs are no longer “iron rice bowls”.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy plat­forms are cre­at­ing new sources of work and in­come by con­nect­ing sup­pli­ers and cus­tomers more ef­fi­ciently. In In­done­sia, an es­ti­mated two mil­lion to three mil­lion on-de­mand mo­tor­cy­cle driv­ers are earn­ing in­come on Go­jek. If this con­sti­tuted for­mal em­ploy­ment, Go­jek would be In­done­sia’s big­gest em­ployer – a stark illustrati­on of the power and po­ten­tial of these plat­forms.</p>
    <p>New types of en­trepreneur­s and op­por­tu­ni­ties abound. At least half of re­tail­ers in Sin­ga­pore, Thai­land, Viet­nam and the Philip­pines now use so­cial me­dia live-sell­ing and “shop­per­tain­ment” to mar­ket their prod­ucts – a trend ac­cel­er­ated by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This pro­vides in­come streams for</p>
    <p>“in­flu­encers” who live-stream mini shows and prod­uct demon­stra­tions for e-com­merce com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>There are many other plat­forms as well. Airbnb opens up op­por­tu­ni­ties to lease a home or room. Carousell al­lows peo­ple to list, sell and buy items. Vid­dsee helps lo­cal film-mak­ers to bet­ter con­nect with tar­get au­di­ences and cor­po­rate part­ners in the oth­er­wise noisy on­line space. And these are just the tip of the ice­berg for as­pir­ing en­trepreneur­s in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>These plat­forms are also en­hanc­ing the re­silience of tra­di­tional busi­nesses. Live-sell­ing on Face­book and hav­ing dig­i­tal pay­ment op­tions have en­abled en­trepreneur­s like Mr Anu­rak Saruethai, the son of a Thai fish­er­man, to make hun­dreds of thousands of dol­lars sell­ing dried seafood prod­ucts, and many ro­bust de­liv­ery ser­vices have been a lifeline to many restau­rants and re­tail­ers in South-east Asia dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Sin­ga­pore’s dig­i­tal econ­omy earned an ad­di­tional US$500 mil­lion (S$661 mil­lion) last year, with some busi­nesses see­ing up to three times their usual growth.</p>
    <p>FROM SKILLS TO CA­PA­BIL­I­TIES</p>
    <p>When Dat started his muf­fin busi­ness, he was un­der­stand­ably anxious. He knew next to noth­ing about so­cial me­dia mar­ket­ing or busi­ness strat­egy. The for­mer did not even ex­ist when he went to univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Dat took a few on­line cour­ses on run­ning a busi­ness to give him the con­fi­dence to start, but the cour­ses were mainly a placebo. He</p>
    <p>would later find that the great­est source of his busi­ness acu­men was from watch­ing how his mother sold her wares when he was young.</p>
    <p>In a fu­ture full of en­tre­pre­neur­ial op­por­tu­ni­ties, ed­u­ca­tion must move be­yond just equip­ping peo­ple with skills aimed at cer­tain pro­fes­sions. The next gen­er­a­tion of work­ers needs to un­der­stand the value of en­dur­ing hu­man ca­pa­bil­i­ties such as ini­tia­tive, cre­ativ­ity, imag­i­na­tion, cu­rios­ity, courage and grit. They need to be able to learn and adapt quickly.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has high­lighted many of these ca­pa­bil­i­ties in ac­tion as busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als have had to rein­vent them­selves. These in­clude an out-of-work Filipino spe­cial-ef­fects artist sell­ing horror masks and a Sin­ga­porean fam­ily mak­ing curry buns to sur­vive job losses.</p>
    <p>As Dat’s ex­pe­ri­ence shows, how peo­ple learn these ca­pa­bil­i­ties is dif­fer­ent from how skills are taught. While course­ware can help, these ca­pa­bil­i­ties are best learnt on the job. Our ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem needs to give peo­ple op­por­tu­ni­ties to ap­ply these ca­pa­bil­i­ties in real life and to learn from men­tors in the work­force.</p>
    <p>Skills are still im­por­tant, but the tra­di­tional approach of learn­ing in blocks of months or years must change. Mi­crolearn­ing is the fu­ture, with mo­du­lar, bite-size ses­sions that can take a few weeks or as lit­tle as five min­utes. Global plat­forms, such as Cours­era and Udemy, and re­gional plat­forms, like Sin­ga­pore’s MySkill­sFu­ture and Thai­land’s Skil­lLane, are early ex­am­ples of mo­du­lar, on-de­mand learn­ing sys­tems.</p>
    <p>FROM ABENOMICS TO ASEANOMICS</p>
    <p>It is still too early to say if Dat’s busi­ness will be a suc­cess. Yet, by many mea­sures, it al­ready is. He turned a pas­sion into a busi­ness and cus­tomers love his muffins. Now, Dat has plans to stop driv­ing Grab and fo­cus on the busi­ness full time. He dreams of ex­pan­sion and, with it, a new life.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, we have good rea­son to be op­ti­mistic about South-east Asia’s fu­ture. Yet, we can no longer rely solely on tra­di­tional pol­i­cy­mak­ing such as Abenomics – the eco­nomic poli­cies cham­pi­oned by for­mer Ja­panese prime min­is­ter Shinzo Abe fo­cused on quan­ti­ta­tive eas­ing and fis­cal stim­u­lus to jump-start the econ­omy. No doubt many gov­ern­ments will ap­ply both these tools as the world emerges from the pan­demic-led global re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a strat­egy de­signed for a stag­nat­ing econ­omy may not be a suit­able long-term pol­icy for the mem­bers of Asean – fast-grow­ing na­tions with enor­mous po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>En­ter Aseanomics: gov­ern­ment poli­cies that ac­cel­er­ate the growth of plat­form busi­nesses, strengthen the struc­tural safety nets for in­di­vid­u­als and small en­ter­prises build­ing busi­nesses on these plat­forms, and develop new mod­els of eq­ui­table shar­ing of value. These poli­cies should there­fore in­clude ini­tia­tives be­ing con­sid­ered by Sin­ga­pore’s Na­tional Trades Union Congress – pro­vid­ing self-em­ployed de­liv­ery rid­ers and cre­ative con­tent pro­fes­sion­als with loss-of-in­come in­sur­ance and ac­cess to cash grants.</p>
    <p>To be clear, multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions, gov­ern­ments and es­tab­lished lo­cal busi­nesses still have a big, and con­tin­u­ing, role to play in pro­vid­ing em­ploy­ment. But gov­ern­ments in the re­gion can no longer ig­nore the fun­da­men­tal changes in their economies and work­forces.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­tedly, Aseanomics is but a play on words and there is no struc­tural way for coun­tries in the re­gion to co­a­lesce on these poli­cies. How­ever, in­di­vid­ual gov­ern­ments can ap­ply prin­ci­ples of Aseanomics to drive re­silient growth in their economies.</p>
    <p>FROM CRI­SIS TO PROS­PER­ITY</p>
    <p>Dat is a fic­tional char­ac­ter. Yet, in a sense, he is also very real. He ex­ists among us South-east Asians as that friend or rel­a­tive we all know – that per­son who has had to rein­vent them­selves dur­ing the pan­demic. At the same time, he rep­re­sents the po­ten­tial fu­ture of our re­gion.</p>
    <p>The world is at a cross­roads. Old, en­trenched sys­tems, from glob­al­i­sa­tion to cap­i­tal­ism, are show­ing cracks in their cur­rent form. Out­dated reg­u­la­tions, pro­cesses and sys­tems are im­ped­ing a tech­nol­ogy-led eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>South-east Asian na­tions have much in their favour. Our de­mo­graph­ics and less deeply en­trenched in­fra­struc­ture can en­able more rapid change than in other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>As a re­gion, we can use this cri­sis as a cat­a­lyst to set a new path – one that ac­cel­er­ates the adop­tion of tech­nol­ogy and en­trepreneur­ship, while shoring up struc­tural safety nets and al­low­ing the eq­ui­table re­dis­tri­bu­tion of wealth.</p>
    <p>Done right, we can put South-east Asia on a path to pros­per­ity for many, and for many decades to come.</p>
