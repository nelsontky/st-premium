    <p>If we can’t agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agree­ment be­tween us, and we should both ac­cept that and move on.</p>
    <p>UK PRIME MIN­IS­TER BORIS JOHN­SON’S OF­FICE, on what he is ex­pected to tell EU lead­ers.</p>
    <p>NO SMALL MAT­TER</p>
    <p>I re­main wor­ried ... the ne­go­ti­a­tions are dif­fi­cult, be­cause the Bri­tish want the best of both worlds.</p>
    <p>EU CHIEF NE­GO­TIA­TOR MICHEL BARNIER</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>LON­DON Bri­tain’s tor­tu­ous di­vorce from the Euro­pean Union veered into fresh cri­sis yes­ter­day af­ter Lon­don threat­ened to un­der­mine the exit deal un­less free trade terms are agreed by next month.</p>
    <p>In yet an­other twist to the fouryear saga since Bri­tain voted narrowly to quit the bloc, Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s gov­ern­ment is said to be plan­ning new leg­is­la­tion to over­ride parts of the Brexit with­drawal agree­ment that it signed in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>That could jeop­ar­dise the whole treaty and cre­ate fric­tions i n Bri­tish-ruled North­ern Ire­land where spe­cial ar­range­ments were made to avoid a hard bor­der with Ire­land to the south that could be detri­men­tal to a peace agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Sec­tions of the pro­posed in­ter­nal mar­ket Bill are ex­pected to “elim­i­nate the le­gal force of parts of the with­drawal agree­ment” in ar­eas in­clud­ing state aid and North­ern Ire­land Cus­toms, the Fi­nan­cial Times news­pa­per said, cit­ing three peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the plans.</p>
    <p>EU diplo­mats were aghast, cau­tion­ing that such a step – leaked on the eve of new talks in Lon­don – would tar­nish Bri­tain’s global pres­tige and heighten chances of a tu­mul­tuous fi­nal dis­en­tan­gling from the bloc on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>The report was nei­ther con­firmed nor de­nied by Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment spokesman said it would work to re­solve out­stand­ing dis­agree­ments about North­ern Ire­land with the EU but was con­sid­er­ing fall back op­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son and French Pres­i­dent Emmanuel Macron, mean­while, agreed yes­ter­day that talks on a Brexit deal needed to make progress this month and reach a conclusion quickly.</p>
    <p>“The Prime Min­is­ter and Pres­i­dent Macron agreed on the im­por­tance of mak­ing progress this month and reach­ing a conclusion on talks quickly,” a state­ment from Mr John­son’s of­fice said, fol­low­ing a call be­tween the two lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain left the EU on Jan 31 but talks on a new trade deal be­fore the end of a sta­tus-quo tran­si­tion ar­range­ment in De­cem­ber have snagged on state aid rules and fish­ing. Lon­don has set a dead­line of Oct 15 to strike a deal.</p>
    <p>“If we can’t agree by then, then I do not see that there will be a free trade agree­ment be­tween us, and we should both ac­cept that and move on,” Mr John­son was to say yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to his of­fice.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean diplo­mats said Bri­tain was play­ing a game of Brexit chicken by threat­en­ing to col­lapse the process and chal­leng­ing Brus­sels to blink first.</p>
    <p>Some fear Mr John­son may view a no-deal exit as use­ful dis­trac­tion from the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>With­out a deal, about US$900 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) in an­nual trade be­tween Bri­tain and the EU could be thrown into un­cer­tainty, in­clud­ing rules on ev­ery­thing from car parts and drugs to fruit and data.</p>
    <p>Some Brexit-sup­port­ing mem­bers of the rul­ing Con­ser­va­tive Party op­pose the with­drawal agree­ment, see­ing it as threat­en­ing Bri­tish in­de­pen­dence even if the two sides se­cure fu­ture trade ties.</p>
    <p>There was sur­prise and anger on both sides of the Ir­ish bor­der and in Brus­sels at the re­ported plan to un­der­mine the with­drawal pact.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers of North­ern Ire­land’s Sinn Fein and SDLP par­ties, the re­gion’s two largest Ir­ish na­tion­al­ist groups, also criticised the gov­ern­ment’s re­ported plan.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish En­vi­ron­ment Sec­re­tary Ge­orge Eus­tice said the gov­ern­ment was com­mit­ted to im­ple­ment­ing the with­drawal agree­ment but some le­gal am­bi­gu­i­ties needed to be ti­died up over the North­ern Ir­ish pro­to­col.</p>
    <p>And EU chief ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier said: “I re­main wor­ried... the ne­go­ti­a­tions are dif­fi­cult, be­cause the Bri­tish want the best of both worlds.”</p>
