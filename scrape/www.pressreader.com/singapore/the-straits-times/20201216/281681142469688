    <p>SOME SEM­BLANCE OF NOR­MALCY</p>
    <p>Across all the dorms in Sin­ga­pore, what we are try­ing to do is to re­sume many of the nor­mal ac­tiv­i­ties they used to en­joy.</p>
    <p>MR JOHNATHAN CHEAH, manag­ing di­rec­tor of S11 Dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>BACK TO DAILY EX­ER­CISE</p>
    <p>We had no choice, we couldn’t go out. But I am happy that I get to run out­doors again.</p>
    <p>CHI­NESE WORKER ZHANG JINLEI, on re­sum­ing his 30-minute morn­ing runs within the dor­mi­tory premises, which were pre­vi­ously not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>In the past few weeks, about 50 pur­pose-built and Quick Build dor­mi­to­ries have ap­plied to the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) for their work­ers to re­sume cer­tain com­mu­nal ac­tiv­i­ties such as out­door sports, board games, cook­ing and even small group movie screen­ings.</p>
    <p>So far, about 30 have re­ceived ap­proval to restart over 120 dif­fer­ent ac­tiv­i­ties within their premises.</p>
    <p>They must en­sure there are safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in place, Mr Tan Fang Qun, com­man­der of Re­gional Com­mand (West) of MOM’s As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment Group, said dur­ing a visit to Changi Lodge 2 on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions for work­ers re­sid­ing in dorms have been grad­u­ally eased in re­cent weeks as part of a cal­i­brated ap­proach taken by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>For­eign work­ers at some dorms can now ex­er­cise at the out­door courts and gyms within the premises, and watch movies in tele­vi­sion rooms dur­ing their free time.</p>
    <p>They can also un­wind in games rooms or use com­mu­nal kitchens to whip up their own meals, if the dorm op­er­a­tors have been given the ap­proval for their work­ers to do so.</p>
    <p>But these work­ers have to abide by cer­tain rules, from stag­gered time slots for the use of kitchen fa­cil­i­ties to main­tain­ing a safe dis­tance in the out­door courts.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions on the more than 300,000 work­ers stay­ing in dorms – in­clud­ing con­fin­ing them to their quarters – were in­tro­duced fol­low­ing a surge in Covid-19 cases in the dorms in April.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, work­ers are still largely re­quired to stay in their dorms ex­cept when they are go­ing to work or run­ning es­sen­tial er­rands. They can also ap­ply to visit spec­i­fied re­cre­ation cen­tres on their rest days.</p>
    <p>At Changi Lodge 2 in Tanah Merah Coast Road, com­mu­nal fa­cil­i­ties that have re­opened in re­cent weeks in­clude the vol­ley­ball court and games room, which re­quire res­i­dents to book time slots in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>In the com­mu­nal kitchen, each floor is al­lo­cated a spe­cific time slot for us­age at meal­times. While there was no time limit in the past, res­i­dents now have to cook within one-hour slots.</p>
    <p>There are also two TV rooms, which can be booked for about two to three hours. There is a five-per­son limit per room, which pre­vi­ously could ac­com­mo­date about 20 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The work­ers are en­cour­aged to en­gage in many of these ac­tiv­i­ties with their room­mates.</p>
    <p>Should a coron­avirus case be dis­cov­ered within a dorm, com­mu­nal ac­tiv­i­ties will be tem­po­rar­ily sus­pended and the close con­tacts of that worker will be quar­an­tined. It would later be as­sessed if it is safe to re­sume ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said it is im­por­tant to take “a cal­i­brated and cau­tious ap­proach” to­wards al­low­ing work­ers back into the com­mu­nity or re­lax­ing some of the re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Johnathan Cheah, manag­ing di­rec­tor of S11 Dor­mi­to­ries, which runs Changi Lodge 2, said some work­ers have been cooped up in their rooms for months, and miss their lives be­fore Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Across all the dorms in Sin­ga­pore, what we are try­ing to do is to re­sume many of the nor­mal ac­tiv­i­ties they used to en­joy,” he added.</p>
    <p>But this is done care­fully, by im­ple­ment­ing sched­uled tim­ings for ac­tiv­i­ties and lim­it­ing the num­ber of peo­ple in­volved at any one time.</p>
    <p>Dorm res­i­dents wel­comed the grad­ual re­sump­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese worker Zhang Jinlei now spends about 30 min­utes ev­ery morn­ing run­ning within the dorm premises. The 36-year-old had been un­able to do so for sev­eral months due to re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“We had no choice, we couldn’t go out,” he said. “But I am happy that I get to run out­doors again.”</p>
