    <p>Mr Bjorn Low is mild-man­nered and soft-spo­ken, ra­di­at­ing an af­fect­ing calm quite be­com­ing of a gen­tle­man farmer who is hap­pi­est tend­ing to his mus­tard frills, Mex­i­can tar­ragon, mi­cro basil and other greens.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old is the founder of ur­ban farm­ing so­cial en­ter­prise Ed­i­ble Gar­den City (EGC). He set it up in 2012 and, in the last eight years, has been beaver­ing away with the au­thor­i­ties, com­mu­ni­ties and busi­nesses to prop­a­gate the ben­e­fits of ur­ban farm­ing, and make Sin­ga­pore a more sus­tain­able and live­able city.</p>
    <p>Among other things, EGC de­vel­ops and main­tains com­mer­cial and res­i­den­tial food gar­dens, grows and sells veg­eta­bles to restau­rants and fam­i­lies, and con­ducts work­shops and talks about ur­ban farm­ing.</p>
    <p>It also or­gan­ises ed­u­ca­tional tours to its Cit­i­zen Farm in Jalan Pen­jara, a closed-loop farm­ing model which not only in­volves the com­mu­nity, but also uses food waste from the city to fer­tilise the crops it cul­ti­vates.</p>
    <p>The out­fit – a 2017 DBS Foun­da­tion Grant awardee – is also big on so­cial im­pact, hir­ing staff who have autism and other spe­cial needs, and push­ing hor­ti­cul­ture ther­apy to pro­mote men­tal health. EGC em­ploy­ees have also re­ceived men­tor­ing and lead­er­ship train­ing through DBS’ Foun­da­tional Lead­er­ship De­vel­op­ment Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>For his ef­forts, Mr Low has earned sev­eral plau­dits, in­clud­ing a 2018 nom­i­na­tion for The Straits Times Sin­ga­porean of the Year award.</p>
    <p>It may sur­prise many, but the con­ge­nial man was once a wild teenager who hung out with gangs.</p>
    <p>Faint scars on his right hand bear tes­ta­ment to his re­bel­lious past – the legacy of a “sug­ges­tive Chi­nese poem” ac­quired at 15 and, shortly af­ter, lasered off at the in­sis­tence of his ex­as­per­ated mother.</p>
    <p>A fish and other as­sorted sym­bols dec­o­rate his left arm. “Th­ese early tat­toos have no mean­ing. Look fierce can al­ready,” he says, laps­ing into Singlish.</p>
    <p>“Only later i n life did t hey be­come mark­ings to re­mem­ber mile­stones in my life,” he adds, re­fer­ring to the tat­toos on his legs, which in­clude The Tree Of Life, a sa­cred sym­bol in Celtic cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Hop­ing to rein in their son’s re­bel­lious­ness, his par­ents sent the for­mer Maris Stella High stu­dent to board­ing school in Australia in his teens. It worked – he later grad­u­ated with a bach­e­lor’s de­gree in mar­ket­ing from Curtin Uni­ver­sity in Perth and an MBA from South­ern Cross Uni­ver­sity in Queens­land.</p>
    <p>He was a suc­cess­ful ad­man for seven years, the last two of which were spent in Lon­don as as­so­ci­ate busi­ness direc­tor at a dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing agency, where his then girl­friend – now his wife – also worked.</p>
    <p>Then, farm­ing and sus­tain­abil­ity were never part of the game plan.</p>
    <p>“It was about mak­ing money, go­ing for cham­pagne brunches,” says Mr Low, who has two young sons. His wife is a part-time yoga teacher.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple’s time in Lon­don ex­posed them to the self-sus­tain­abil­ity and lo­cal food move­ments, which so in­trigued them that they even­tu­ally left their jobs and spent the next three years work­ing on farms across Europe and in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Mr Low later stud­ied bio­dy­namic agri­cul­ture in East Sus­sex be­fore re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore in 2011 to be­come an ur­ban farmer.</p>
    <p>His folks were sup­port­ive, but rel­a­tives chided him for throw­ing away his ca­reer, es­pe­cially since he has an MBA.</p>
    <p>Over the past eight years, EGC has built more than 200 food gar­dens for the likes of Ma­rina Bay Sands, Re­sorts World Sen­tosa and Fair­mont Ho­tel, and won a slew of busi­ness and sus­tain­abil­ity awards. Last year, the com­pany, which was started with cap­i­tal of $10,000, made $1.6 mil­lion in rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Its 35 em­ploy­ees in­clude sev­eral for­mer cor­po­rate types, in­clud­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Sameull Ang, who worked for com­pa­nies in­clud­ing Burger King and Asia-Pa­cific Brew­eries.</p>
    <p>The 62-year-old says: “I am blessed to be able to use my pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tor ex­pe­ri­ence as a force for good. I sur­vived two close shaves with death when I was in pri­mary school – be­ing run over by a taxi and a nar­row es­cape from a chop­per-wield­ing amok.</p>
    <p>“It makes me value life as if I have been given a sec­ond chance. When I wake up ev­ery morn­ing, I re­mind my­self to live my life to make a dif­fer­ence and im­pact the lives of those around me.”</p>
    <p>Asked what – con­vic­tion, faith or luck – has been most im­por­tant in his jour­ney, Mr Low says: “Hav­ing con­vic­tion is im­por­tant dur­ing the ini­tial start-up phase. Luck plays a sig­nif­i­cant part – it boils down to meet­ing the right peo­ple and be­ing in the right place at the right time.</p>
    <p>“And I turn to faith and prayers when I have no more con­vic­tion and luck left.”</p>
    <p>You were a re­bel­lious teen and even briefly joined a gang. How did a wild child end up as a chill and in­tro­spec­tive ur­ban farmer?</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up as an in­tro­verted only child, I found it hard to con­nect with peo­ple and had trou­ble find­ing my tribe. But the tribe found me and brought me into a com­mu­nity of peers, who gave me the sense of be­long­ing I craved.</p>
    <p>Be­ing re­bel­lious in my early years made me more street-smart and gave me the need to achieve and drive to suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>In my early ca­reer, my fo­cus was on mak­ing money, do­ing busi­ness, work­ing my way up the cor­po­rate lad­der. But it made my life too com­pli­cated and un­ful­fill­ing.</p>
    <p>I found peace in the gar­den, work­ing with plants and na­ture. When I first started, I thought I could out­smart na­ture, rush cer­tain things, con­trol the en­vi­ron­ment, play God. But I was so wrong. I’ve been hum­bled by na­ture. Now, I just try to find bal­ance in my life.</p>
    <p>You spent nearly a decade as a highly paid ad­man. The leap from con­tex­tual tar­get­ing to lasagna gar­den­ing is a bit ex­treme, no?</p>
    <p>This is my re­bel­lious na­ture break­ing out, want­ing to do some­thing ex­treme. Per­haps it was more to fill the void of a friv­o­lous mar­ket­ing ca­reer, and the need to shake things up a lit­tle and do some­thing with mean­ing. Lead a sim­ple life and be kind to the earth.</p>
    <p>You went to agri­cul­tural school, where one of the things you had to do was slaugh­ter tur­keys. How trau­matic or life-chang­ing was that?</p>
    <p>Go­ing to an agri­cul­tural school in East Sus­sex and spend­ing time in Wales on a small hold­ing was lifechang­ing.</p>
    <p>I’d been a meat eater all my life and hav­ing an op­por­tu­nity to con­nect with the an­i­mals I ate was an im­por­tant part of the jour­ney.</p>
    <p>I didn’t want to con­tinue to live a life of con­sum­ing and not know­ing. Go­ing through the slaugh­ter­ing process kept me grounded and more ap­pre­cia­tive of my food.</p>
    <p>What three rea­sons would you give to con­vince peo­ple that ur­ban farm­ing is far from a loopy idea and that it is im­por­tant for a place like Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>It’s not some­thing new, trendy or loopy. Ur­ban farm­ing has been around through­out his­tory. Dur­ing World War II, the Dig For Vic­tory cam­paign in Bri­tain – where peo­ple were en­cour­aged to grow their own food – saw farms sprout­ing all over ur­ban spa­ces. The Cuban Oil Em­bargo got cit­i­zens to dig over carparks to grow their own food in the city.</p>
    <p>Ur­ban farm­ing can im­prove com­mu­nity bond­ing, gen­er­ate pos­i­tive so­cial out­comes and pro­vide en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact. It al­lows cit­i­zens to par­tic­i­pate in the food move­ment, gives them ac­cess to clean and healthy veg­eta­bles, and sup­ports and im­proves their men­tal state of mind through the pos­i­tive ef­fects of hor­ti­cul­ture ther­apy.</p>
    <p>Ur­ban farm­ing can heal the body through the food we eat, the mind through the ac­tiv­i­ties we can do on the farm and the soul by re­pair­ing the en­vi­ron­ment around us.</p>
    <p>Which is eas­ier to handle: veg­eta­bles or hu­mans?</p>
    <p>I love deal­ing with plants. They speak to you in sub­tle ways and if you nur­ture them, they give back. Hu­mans are sim­i­lar, but there is a chal­lenge: They tend to talk back.</p>
    <p>Also, deal­ing with hu­man emotions can be men­tally tax­ing. But I want to build on my con­nec­tion with peo­ple. It is my per­sonal jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Tell me about some of the in­ter­est­ing in­di­vid­u­als who have joined EGC as ur­ban farm­ers.</p>
    <p>We’ve had for­mer bankers, aero­space en­gi­neers, ex-of­fend­ers and adults with autism. Many of them want a change in ca­reer. They want to do some­thing mean­ing­ful in the sus­tain­able space.</p>
    <p>One who has left a deep im­pres­sion on me is Yi­jie, who is in his early 20s and has high-func­tion­ing autism. He had a data-en­try job in a bank and was not happy with his role.</p>
    <p>He said he didn’t be­lieve in work­ing for a multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tion and wanted to join EGC as it is not main­stream. He has fully in­te­grated with our team and taken on more re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Do you agree that farm­ing and gar­den­ing can be as ef­fec­tive as anti-de­pres­sants for sad, lonely or mal­ad­justed in­di­vid­u­als?</p>
    <p>Yes, for sure. When I spend time in the gar­den, I feel happy and con­tented. I knew there were some ben­e­fits to my men­tal well-be­ing, but it was al­ways a feel­ing and not sci­en­tif­i­cally proven.</p>
    <p>But the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore and NParks have done stud­ies with sci­en­tific ev­i­dence that hor­ti­cul­ture ther­apy can have pos­i­tive ben­e­fits such as low­er­ing stress mark­ers in the body.</p>
    <p>What can farm­ing and gar­den­ing teach us about life?</p>
    <p>To­day, the gar­den looks beau­ti­ful and boun­ti­ful, but to­mor­row, Mr Cater­pil­lar can de­scend and munch through half your gar­den.</p>
    <p>The gar­den and farm teach us that things are im­per­ma­nent and are in a con­stant state of flux.</p>
    <p>It’s the same with life. To­day, ev­ery­thing may be well for you, but the next day, ev­ery­thing may just go wrong.</p>
    <p>What does pur­pose mean to you?</p>
    <p>The mean­ing of pur­pose has changed over time for me. When I first went into cor­po­rate life, mak­ing money was my pur­pose. It gave me the drive to wake up ev­ery morn­ing and to work late ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>When I left that world to learn farm­ing, my pur­pose was to see if I could beat the rat race and live a self-sus­tain­ing life.</p>
    <p>When I started EGC, my pur­pose was to build an agri­cul­ture move­ment in Sin­ga­pore and a plat­form for Sin­ga­pore­ans who wish to do this to come to­gether to learn and grow. My pur­pose was also to en­sure that the busi­ness has a heart and will cre­ate change in the en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and com­mu­nity spa­ces.</p>
    <p>But, over­all, pur­pose to me is to serve oth­ers as I find joy, ful­fil­ment and mean­ing in do­ing that. I wake up driven ev­ery morn­ing be­cause of that.</p>
