    <p>In the best of times, fash­ion can be a source of de­light, in­spi­ra­tion, in­ven­tion and fan­tasy. But th­ese are not the best of times.</p>
    <p>As the coro­n­avirus pan­demic rages on, the trap­pings of mod­ern fash­ion — epic shows in glam­orous lo­cales, new must-haves every sea­son, prod­uct drops at fran­tic speeds and fre­quen­cies — are sud­denly look­ing painfully out of touch. From re­tail net­works to sup­ply chains, the in­dus­try as we know it has been dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>How­ever, one of the pow­ers of fash­ion is also its abil­ity to re­flect the times, and in th­ese times of grave un­cer­tainty, the in­dus­try has shown sur­pris­ing re­silience and adap­ta­tion — putting thoughts of prof­itabil­ity aside to throw its con­sid­er­able mus­cle and re­sources be­hind re­lief, re­search and emer­gency ef­forts.</p>
    <p>When the virus first started seep­ing out of China in Jan­u­ary, the ma­jor fash­ion weeks still car­ried on. It was not quite busi­ness as usual — face masks and hand sani­tis­ers were spot­ted ev­ery­where, from front rows to back­stage – but the threat had not yet ex­ploded to its cur­rent scale.</p>
    <p>When Gior­gio Ar­mani can­celled his Mi­lan Fash­ion Week show in lieu of a vir­tual live stream, more than a few viewed it as un­nec­es­sary cau­tion.</p>
    <p>But Italy soon turned into an epi­cen­tre of the pan­demic and hos­pi­tals were over­whelmed. Fash­ion brands sprang into ac­tion. The Ar­mani Group do­nated €1.25 mil­lion (S$2 mil­lion) to Ital­ian hos­pi­tals. The Prada Group do­nated six in­ten­sive care and re­sus­ci­ta­tion units to three Mi­lanese hos­pi­tals. Donatella and</p>
    <p>Al­le­gra Ver­sace each pledged €100,000 to Mi­lan’s San Raf­faele hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Mon­cler gave €10 mil­lion to sup­port the con­struc­tion of a new hospi­tal with 400 in­ten­sive care units. Ker­ing com­mit­ted €2 mil­lion to Italy and Tod’s, €5 mil­lion. Bvl­gari and Dolce&Gab­bana poured money into re­search ef­forts fo­cused on find­ing a cure.</p>
    <p>When the virus tore through the rest of Europe, fash­ion’s big­gest names stepped up to the plate. LVMH turned its per­fume fac­to­ries over to the pro­duc­tion of hand sani­tis­ers — a valu­able re­source that the con­glom­er­ate dis­trib­uted for free to the health au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Prada fol­lowed suit, con­vert­ing its fac­to­ries to man­u­fac­ture med­i­cal gowns and masks, as did the Zegna Group.</p>
    <p>In Lon­don, Burberry sim­i­larly re­tooled its York­shire fac­tory to make masks and gowns while fund­ing vac­cine re­search and mak­ing do­na­tions to char­ity or­gan­i­sa­tions that tackle food poverty.</p>
    <p>The Yoox Net-a-Porter group do­nated its en­tire Pre­miere De­liv­ery Ser­vice fleet to Age UK out­posts, which make es­sen­tial de­liv­er­ies to the el­derly and the vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>As the virus hit the United States, Amer­i­can brands swiftly jumped into the fray. Be­he­moths such as Ralph Lau­ren and PVH com­mit­ted mil­lions of dol­lars to sup­port em­ploy­ees, health­care work­ers and smaller Amer­i­can fash­ion busi­nesses im­pacted by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As ad­mirable, heroic even, as th­ese ac­tions are, they are fun­da­men­tally tem­po­rary mea­sures to patch the holes that the coro­n­avirus has ripped in our so­cioe­co­nomic fabric. What comes af­ter?</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­tedly, of all the things to worry and be afraid about now, an in­dus­try deal­ing in im­agery and imag­i­na­tion is not the eas­i­est for which to feel sym­pa­thy.</p>
    <p>Though fash­ion in its cur­rent form may be one of the most dam­ag­ing in­dus­tries to the planet, it is also one of the largest driv­ers of the world econ­omy and the source of liveli­hood for mil­lions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a joint re­port pub­lished re­cently by Busi­ness of Fash­ion and McKin­sey & Com­pany, the global fash­ion in­dus­try — which grew to US$2.5 tril­lion in worth be­fore the pan­demic — is ex­pected to see rev­enues shrink by 30 per cent in 2020.</p>
    <p>The per­sonal lux­ury goods sec­tor — which en­com­passes lux­ury fash­ion, ac­ces­sories, watches, jew­ellery and high-end beauty — will be even harder hit, with es­ti­mates of rev­enue con­trac­tions of 35 to 39 per cent.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, LVMH had an­tic­i­pated first-quar­ter sales to dip by 20 per cent, while Ker­ing pro­jected a drop of 13 to 14 per cent.</p>
    <p>Burberry, with its higher ex­po­sure to brick-and-mor­tar re­tail in China, pre­dicted sales to fall by al­most 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>As of the first week of April, the shares of Capri Hold­ings – which owns brands such as Ver­sace and Jimmy Choo – had lost 58 per cent of its value. Those of Ta­pes­try, which owns Kate Spade and Coach, de­clined by 45 per cent and Ralph Lau­ren’s by 37 per cent.</p>
    <p>The 2020 cruise shows have all been can­celled or post­poned, as have the men’s and haute couture fash­ion weeks.</p>
    <p>The fate of the Septem­ber shows re­mains up in the air.</p>
    <p>Think of all the fin­ished de­signs that will never make it to the shop floor, the small busi­nesses un­able to cover rent and hav­ing to fold, the mer­chan­dise – a re­sult of col­lec­tive time, money and ef­fort – lan­guish­ing on shelves, re­tail and man­u­fac­tur­ing work­ers put out of their jobs, the limbo ex­is­tence of the free­lance work­ers and cre­atives that are the beat­ing heart of the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>It is ex­tremely hard to think of the long term when the day-to-day can change so dras­ti­cally. But per­haps in its own twisted way, there is no bet­ter time for reck­on­ing and re­con­fig­u­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Do we need to travel so much? Do we need to con­sume so vo­ra­ciously? Do we need to churn out new prod­uct at such re­lent­less, dizzy­ing speed?</p>
    <p>In what seemed like a life­time ago, Mi­uc­cia Prada and Raf Si­mons sat down for a joint in­ter­view with Sys­tem mag­a­zine. Even back then in 2016, the two vi­sion­ar­ies were al­ready hav­ing qualms about fash­ion’s tra­jec­tory.</p>
    <p>“I think there’s some­thing slightly wrong about this idea of big brands,” Prada said.</p>
    <p>Si­mons agreed: “There is no more free­dom in the struc­ture of a</p>
    <p>House; it has evolved into this kind of mas­sive oc­to­pus where the struc­ture it­self has be­come too dom­i­nant and too defin­ing.”</p>
    <p>Four years later, the two would team up in an un­prece­dented move to co-helm Prada — a sign of the in­dus­try be­gin­ning to re­cal­i­brate even be­fore the pan­demic hit. And when all this is over, we will still need beauty; we will need to dream again.</p>
    <p>But per­haps this time around, those dreams can be in­ter­twined with more mind­ful­ness and mean­ing.</p>
    <p>Per­haps they can take place in a world where cre­ativ­ity trumps com­merce, where soul­ful en­gage­ment and sto­ry­telling take prece­dence over likes and mil­lions of fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>Jean Touitou, founder of French fash­ion brand A.P.C, thinks this will be the sil­ver lin­ing of this cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In a con­ver­sa­tion with Tim</p>
    <p>Blanks for web­site Busi­ness of Fash­ion, Touitou said he could see “how this will in­spire a dif­fer­ent kind of cre­ativ­ity”.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter how dark it gets, there will al­ways be light at the end of the tun­nel – even though the end of this dark tun­nel is in­dis­cernible for now.</p>
    <p>If the past has taught us any­thing, it is that fash­ion emerges from crises with more clar­ity, pur­pose and cre­ativ­ity.</p>
    <p>Post-World War I fash­ion lib­er­ated women from corsets and hoop skirts. The end of World War II birthed a new kind of beauty (and the New Look).</p>
    <p>The Great Re­ces­sion of 2008 stripped away fri­vol­ity for Philo-driven prac­ti­cal­ity and em­pow­er­ment.</p>
    <p>What will post-Covid-19 bring? “Less is more” will be a good start. But one thing’s for sure – as Touitou said: “De­sire can­not dis­ap­pear.”</p>
    <p>And that is the power of fash­ion.</p>

Fash&#xAD;ion may be seen as friv&#xAD;o&#xAD;lous and a low priority in a pan&#xAD;demic, but there will still be a place for the cre&#xAD;ativ&#xAD;ity and soul&#xAD;ful en&#xAD;gage&#xAD;ment of the in&#xAD;dus&#xAD;try.</p>
