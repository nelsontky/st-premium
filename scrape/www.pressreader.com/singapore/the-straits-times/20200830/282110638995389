    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese swim­ming star Rikako Ikee made her sport­ing come­back in Tokyo yes­ter­day, com­pet­ing for the first time since a shock l eu­kaemia di­ag­no­sis last year.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old had been a strong favourite for the 100m but­ter­fly gold at the now-post­poned Olympic Games be­fore re­veal­ing she had can­cer.</p>
    <p>She was dis­charged from hos­pi­tal in De­cem­ber af­ter around 10 months of treat­ment and re­sumed train­ing in March.</p>
    <p>“The fact that I’m swim­ming and</p>
    <p>I’m here again... I’m moved,” she told re­porters af­ter win­ning the 50m freestyle race, which was or­gan­ised by the Tokyo Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion, in 26.32sec.</p>
    <p>“My goal was to en­joy it with­out think­ing too much and I re­ally could.”</p>
    <p>Ikee is now el­i­gi­ble to par­tic­i­pate in Ja­pan’s In­ter Col­lege Swim­ming Cham­pi­onships in Oc­to­ber – a goal she has set for her­self.</p>
    <p>“I was ner­vous but I was able to beat the time I was aim­ing for,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ikee had also been seen as a con­tender for the 200m freestyle at the Tokyo 2020 Games but, af­ter her di­ag­no­sis, she switched her fo­cus to com­pet­ing in the 2024 edi­tion in Paris.</p>
    <p>She has not yet said if she plans to re­think and com­pete in Tokyo next July.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, the six-gold medal win­ner at the 2018 Asian Games in In­done­sia posted two videos show­ing her train­ing ahead of yes­ter­day’s race, prompt­ing tens of thou­sands of likes and retweets.</p>
    <p>“I can do 10 chin-ups now... I couldn’t do any a cou­ple of months ago,” she wrote along­side one of the clips, which has been viewed more than 2.3 mil­lion times.</p>
    <p>Ikee has gained plenty of ad­mir­ers af­ter doc­u­ment­ing her ex­pe­ri­ence with leukaemia on so­cial me­dia, and also served as the key fig­ure at a sub­dued year-to-go cer­e­mony for the post­poned Games last month.</p>
    <p>She then urged dis­heart­ened ath­letes not to lose faith be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, say­ing “to over­come ad­ver­sity, what we need is hope”.</p>
