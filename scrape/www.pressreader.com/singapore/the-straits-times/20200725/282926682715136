    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tress and for­mer Scien­tol­o­gist Leah Rem­ini is out to prove that the group’s most fa­mous mem­ber, Tom Cruise, is not the nice guy he seems to be.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress has a new pod­cast, Scien­tol­ogy: Fair Game, which cen­tres on Scien­tol­ogy’s al­leged prac­tice of us­ing in­tim­i­da­tion to si­lence its crit­ics.</p>
    <p>She told The Daily Beast: “Tom has got away with be­ing this ‘nice guy’ be­cause that’s what Scien­tol­ogy pol­icy says – to cre­ate good pub­lic re­la­tions in the world and make those ‘good ac­tions’ known. But if you ac­tu­ally look at his ac­tions, they’re not con­sis­tent.”</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old said when she was a mem­ber, she was told off by Scien­tol­ogy head David Mis­cav­ige for ques­tion­ing its de­ci­sion to use Cruise as its “poster child”.</p>
    <p>“I learnt pretty quickly that that’s not some­thing you should be do­ing be­cause Tom Cruise is con­sid­ered a mes­siah in Scien­tol­ogy,” she said.</p>
    <p>“This is a man who has not even seen his own daugh­ter in years. That this guy can be run­ning around and hav­ing peo­ple think he’s this su­per-nice guy, I don’t get it.”</p>
    <p>Rem­ini is one of Scien­tol­ogy’s most out­spo­ken crit­ics. In 2013, she made the news when she abruptly left the or­gan­i­sa­tion af­ter be­ing an ac­tive mem­ber for 34 years. Her mother, ac­tor hus­band An­gelo Pa­gan and their daugh­ter Sofia also left shortly af­ter.</p>
    <p>Her new pod­cast sees her team up with the doc­u­men­tary’s co-host, for­mer Scien­tol­ogy spokesman and se­nior ex­ec­u­tive Mike Rin­der.</p>
    <p>Rem­ini also praised fel­low ac­tress Thandie New­ton for re­cently open­ing up about Cruise’s al­leged strange be­hav­iour dur­ing the film­ing of Mis­sion: Im­pos­si­ble 2 (2000).</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with en­ter­tain­ment web­site Vul­ture, the English ac­tress said work­ing with Cruise was a “night­mare”.</p>
    <p>Rem­ini said: “I think New­ton speak­ing out about what we all know Tom to be is not news to peo­ple who are or were Scien­tol­o­gists, who know the truth. Be­cause he is not a nice per­son.</p>
    <p>“There was a time when Tom was a very nice per­son, but that was be­fore he reded­i­cated him­self to David Mis­cav­ige in the 2000s.”</p>
