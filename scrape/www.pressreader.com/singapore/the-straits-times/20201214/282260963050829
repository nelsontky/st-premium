    <p>Even be­fore Sin­ga­pore’s first Covid-19 case was de­tected on Jan 23, the lo­cal re­search com­mu­nity was mov­ing to pivot quickly to Covid-19 re­search, de­vel­op­ing a re­sponse on all fronts: from man­u­fac­tur­ing test swabs to build­ing the coun­try’s test­ing arse­nal.</p>
    <p>This was pos­si­ble only be­cause of a strong foun­da­tion in sci­ence.</p>
    <p>Said Pro­fes­sor Low Teck Seng, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion (NRF): “Our na­tional re­sponse to Covid-19 builds on the broad base of sci­en­tific ca­pa­bil­i­ties that Sin­ga­pore has built up over the years.”</p>
    <p>He added: “For in­stance, our ca­pa­bil­i­ties in in­fec­tious dis­eases and di­ag­nos­tic test kit de­vel­op­ment have sup­ported our na­tional test­ing and virus surveil­lance ef­forts.</p>
    <p>“This has en­abled the RIE (re­search, in­no­va­tion and en­ter­prise) com­mu­nity to swiftly pivot and scale up its re­sponse as needed.”</p>
    <p>To sup­port re­search ef­forts, the Min­istry of Health and NRF launched a $45 mil­lion Covid-19 re­search fund un­der the RIE plan for this year. It has gone to­wards re­search ar­eas such as the mod­el­ling of vi­ral trans­mis­sion, de­vel­op­ing novel ther­a­pies and trans­lat­ing re­search out­comes into prod­ucts and so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s ef­forts have paid off. A vac­cine is now in the pipe­line, with the first ship­ments ex­pected in the first quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>Dubbed Lu­nar-Cov19, it is co-de­vel­oped by Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School and Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary find­ings from earlystage tri­als in­di­cate pos­i­tive re­sponses in both safety and hu­man im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>So far, no se­ri­ous side ef­fects have been ob­served, and phase three clin­i­cal tri­als should start this month.</p>
    <p>As at the end of last month, lo­cal re­searchers have con­trib­uted more than 1,100 sci­en­tific publi­ca­tions to an in­ter­na­tional pool of knowl­edge on Covid-19, with re­search be­gin­ning as early as in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School an­nounced on Jan 30 that its team of sci­en­tists had suc­cess­fully cul­tured the virus from an in­fected pa­tient’s sam­ple, mak­ing the Repub­lic the third coun­try in the world out­side of China to do so.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, the first made-in-Sin­ga­pore di­ag­nos­tic kit, For­ti­tude, which can de­tect the Covid-19 virus with high ac­cu­racy, was rolled out lo­cally. It is now in use at 13 hos­pi­tals and lab­o­ra­to­ries here, as well as in­ter­na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>Other sci­en­tists, too, have piv­oted from their ar­eas of ex­per­tise to de­velop di­ag­nos­tic test kits.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Peter Preiser, as­so­ciate vice-pres­i­dent for biomed­i­cal and life sciences at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, re­de­ployed his plat­form tech­nol­ogy, ini­tially used to dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween types of malaria par­a­sites, to de­tect pro­teins pro­duced by the Sars-CoV-2 virus.</p>
    <p>This helped him de­velop two test kits: an anti­gen rapid test and a serol­ogy test.</p>
    <p>To meet lo­cal test­ing de­mands, re­searchers from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore linked up with Te­masek Foun­da­tion and pro­duced three dif­fer­ent swab de­signs through 3D print­ing and in­jec­tion mould­ing.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 7.5 mil­lion 3D-printed swabs and around five mil­lion in­jec­tion-moulded swabs have been pro­duced this year.</p>
    <p>The team is on track to meet the de­mand for 60 mil­lion in­jec­tion­moulded swabs, which they will de­liver through­out next year.</p>
    <p>Ther­a­peu­tics re­search into Covid-19 is also show­ing promis­ing re­sults.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, lo­cal biotech­nol­ogy com­pany Ty­chan an­nounced that it is con­duct­ing the fi­nal phase of clin­i­cal tri­als for its an­ti­body T027, which could help Covid-19 pa­tients re­cover faster.</p>
    <p>Even as work con­tin­ues at full throt­tle, more is be­ing planned.</p>
    <p>Part of a $25 bil­lion RIE plan for the coun­try over the next five years in­cludes in­vest­ment in a na­tional ef­fort to guard against fu­ture threats from in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
