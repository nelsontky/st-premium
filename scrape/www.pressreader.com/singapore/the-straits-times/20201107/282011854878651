    <p>•</p>
    <p>VI­ENNA Aus­tria has closed a mosque and an Is­lamic as­so­ci­a­tion fre­quented by a man who shot four peo­ple dead in a ram­page through the cap­i­tal Vi­enna on Mon­day, In­te­gra­tion Min­is­ter Su­sanne Raab said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The two sites had con­tributed to the at­tacker’s rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion, she told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old con­victed Is­lamist mil­i­tant was shot dead by po­lice within min­utes of open­ing fire on by­standers and bars. He was later iden­ti­fied as dual Aus­tri­anMace­do­nian na­tional Ku­j­tim Fe­jzu­lai.</p>
    <p>Ms Raab said the gov­ern­ment’s re­li­gious af­fairs of­fice “was in­formed by the in­te­rior min­istry that Mon­day’s at­tacker, since his re­lease from prison, had re­peat­edly vis­ited two Vi­enna mosques”.</p>
    <p>The mosques are in Vi­enna’s west­ern sub­urbs, one called the Melit Ibrahim mosque in the Ot­takring district and the other, the Te­whid mosque in the Mei­dling area.</p>
    <p>The BVT do­mes­tic in­tel­li­gence agency “told us that the vis­its to these mosques fur­thered the at­tacker’s rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion,” Ms Raab said.</p>
    <p>Only one of the mosques was of­fi­cially reg­is­tered as such, she added.</p>
    <p>A state­ment from the of­fi­cially recog­nised Is­lamic Re­li­gious Com­mu­nity of Aus­tria said one of­fi­cially reg­is­tered mosque was be­ing shut be­cause it had bro­ken rules over “re­li­gious doc­trine and its con­sti­tu­tion”, as well as na­tional leg­is­la­tion gov­ern­ing Is­lamic in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>The Vi­enna pros­e­cu­tor’s de­part­ment yes­ter­day told AFP that six of the 16 peo­ple de­tained since the at­tack have been re­leased, with the rest still in cus­tody as the probe into the at­tacker’s cir­cle con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>Fe­jzu­lai had pre­vi­ously been con­victed for try­ing to join the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).</p>
    <p>The head of the agency re­spon­si­ble for anti-ter­ror op­er­a­tions in Vi­enna has been sus­pended pend­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Mon­day’s at­tack, po­lice said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The head of the re­gional Of­fice for the Pro­tec­tion of the Con­sti­tu­tion and Anti-Ter­ror­ism asked me to sus­pend his func­tions be­cause he doesn’t want to stand in the way of an or­derly in­quiry and ex­pla­na­tion” of the events sur­round­ing the at­tack, Vi­enna po­lice pres­i­dent Ger­hard Puer­stl told a press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Po­lice i n Ger­many yes­ter­day searched homes and busi­nesses linked to four peo­ple be­lieved to have had ties with Fe­jzu­lai, whom the Aus­trian au­thor­i­ties have de­scribed as an “Is­lamist ter­ror­ist”.</p>
    <p>The sus­pects de­tained in Ger­many dur­ing raids there had spent time with Fe­jzu­lai, Mr Puer­stl said.</p>
    <p>That in­for­ma­tion, com­bined with in­tel­li­gence from Slo­vakia that the at­tacker had tried to buy am­mu­ni­tion there, could have led to a “dif­fer­ent out­come” and a dif­fer­ent as­sess­ment of the threat he posed, Mr Puer­stl said.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s BKA crim­i­nal po­lice ear­lier said a fed­eral judge had is­sued search war­rants for the homes and busi­nesses in the Ger­man towns of Osnabrueck, Kas­sel and in the district of Pin­neberg near Ham­burg af­ter the Aus­trian ju­di­ciary trans­ferred some of its find­ings on the at­tack to Ger­man pros­e­cu­tors.</p>
    <p>Switzer­land has ar­rested two men in con­nec­tion with the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Swedish po­lice said they put forces on na­tional alert yes­ter­day af­ter a se­ries of mil­i­tant at­tacks in Europe, al­though the na­tion’s ter­ror­ism threat level re­mained un­changed.</p>
    <p>“The aim is, among other things, that the po­lice can re­act quickly should there be a ter­ror at­tack,” Swedish po­lice said in a state­ment.</p>
