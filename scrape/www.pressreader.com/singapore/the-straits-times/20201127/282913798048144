    <p>LONDON • Bri­tish char­i­ties help­ing fam­i­lies deal with mis­car­riages on Wed­nes­day praised Meghan Markle for lift­ing a taboo with a first-per­son es­say in The New York Times.</p>
    <p>“I just ap­plaud Meghan for show­ing the courage to share their story so beau­ti­fully and elo­quently,” said Ms Zoe Clark-Coates, head of The Mari­posa Trust, which sup­ports peo­ple who have had mis­car­riages or lost chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“It gives peo­ple in­sight into a sub­ject that is of­ten not dis­cussed and brought into the light,” added Ms Clark-Coates, who has writ­ten books about grief and preg­nancy.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery time a celebrity talks about mis­car­riage or a sto­ry­line in a tele­vi­sion show cov­ers the sub­ject, “we see a mas­sive surge in peo­ple ask­ing for sup­port”, she told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>She also praised Markle’s piece – a first-per­son es­say about her mis­car­riage in July – for de­scrib­ing how Prince Harry was suf­fer­ing as a fa­ther and for ex­press­ing grief de­spite the cou­ple al­ready hav­ing a child, Archie, born last year.</p>
    <p>Some cou­ples feel they can­not talk about their pain af­ter a mis­car­riage if they have a healthy child, she said. “It’s mak­ing peo­ple feel less alone,” she said.</p>
    <p>She likened the im­pact of the pub­li­ca­tion to an In­sta­gram post by Amer­i­can model Chrissy Teigen that showed her grief-stricken in hospi­tal af­ter her son was still­born.</p>
    <p>The post pub­lished last month was “liked” more than 11 mil­lion times, but was also crit­i­cised by some as overly shock­ing and in­ti­mate.</p>
    <p>Markle’s opin­ion piece comes af­ter Prince Harry and his brother Wil­liam talked about the need to be open about men­tal health is­sues. Ms Clark-Coates said: “I’m not sur­prised they’ve been brave enough to do this.”</p>
    <p>Roughly one in five – 250,000 preg­nan­cies – ends in mis­car­riage ev­ery year in Bri­tain, ac­cord­ing to Tommy’s, a char­ity which funds re­search into mis­car­riage, still­birth and pre­ma­ture birth.</p>
    <p>“It’s a real taboo in so­ci­ety, so moth­ers like Meghan shar­ing their sto­ries is a vi­tal step in break­ing down that stigma and shame,” said Ms So­phie King, a mid­wife at the char­ity.</p>
    <p>“Her hon­esty and open­ness to­day send a pow­er­ful mes­sage to any­one who loses a baby: this may feel in­cred­i­bly lonely, but you are not alone.”</p>
    <p>The stigma around mis­car­riage pre­vents many peo­ple from ask­ing for sup­port, said Ms Karen Burgess, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Petals, a char­ity that of­fers coun­selling to peo­ple who have lost a baby.</p>
    <p>She praised Markle’s “frank, raw ac­count”, say­ing: “We hope this opens the door for more cou­ples to feel they can do the same.”</p>
