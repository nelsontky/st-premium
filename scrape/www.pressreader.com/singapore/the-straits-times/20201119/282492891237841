    <p>Bri­tish ac­tor John Boyega ripped a hole in the fab­ric of the Star Wars uni­verse when, in in­ter­views ear­lier this year, he spoke about how his char­ac­ter Finn, the stormtroop­er who de­fected to the re­sis­tance, was “pushed to the side”.</p>
    <p>First in­tro­duced in 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awak­ens, Finn seemed poised to be a cen­tral player. Boyega was made the model of a more in­clu­sive fran­chise that un­til then used non­white ac­tors in sup­port­ing roles.</p>
    <p>But in The Last Jedi (2017) and clos­ing chap­ter The Rise Of Sky­walker (2019), Finn and the char­ac­ter of Rose Tico, played by Kelly Marie Tran, an Amer­i­can ac­tress of Viet­namese her­itage, be­came an in­dus­try cliche: The non-white char­ac­ters who help the white saviours, played by Adam Driver and Daisy Ri­d­ley, win the day.</p>
    <p>In­stead of go­ing with the orig­i­nal story of nor­mal hu­mans like Finn, Rose and Poe Dameron (played by Os­car Isaac) win­ning the right to lead a rev­o­lu­tion against the dic­ta­to­rial First Or­der, Dis­ney de­cided to fall back on a safer arc.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus shifted to elites who be­come lead­ers be­cause of their lin­eage.</p>
    <p>Boyega, 28, can now be seen in the an­thol­ogy minis­eries Small Axe, com­pris­ing five films cre­ated and di­rected by Os­car-win­ning Bri­tish film-maker Steve McQueen.</p>
    <p>The films are based on sto­ries, both fact-based and fic­tional, about peo­ple from Lon­don’s West In­dian com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Over cen­turies, im­mi­grants from the Caribbean set­tled in the city, cre­at­ing a dis­tinct iden­tity for them­selves and marked by so­cial progress but also racial op­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Boyega ap­pears in the third film ti­tled Red, White And Blue. It is based on the true story of Leroy Lo­gan, a foren­sics sci­en­tist who be­comes a po­lice of­fi­cer after his fa­ther is as­saulted by two white of­fi­cers act­ing on racist im­pulses.</p>
    <p>Lo­gan was held up as some­one who rep­re­sented a new, more pro­gres­sive force.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the global press in a vir­tual con­fer­ence for Small Axe last month, Boyega was asked if there was any­thing in Lo­gan’s ex­pe­ri­ence that mir­rored his own.</p>
    <p>With­out ad­dress­ing the Star Wars con­tro­versy di­rectly, he spoke about the psy­cho­log­i­cal im­pact of be­com­ing the face of a brand.</p>
    <p>“For Leroy, there was a mar­ket­ing side. He was in the news­pa­pers. He was the face of a new, di­verse po­lice force, used to mo­ti­vate other black i ndi­vid­u­als to join,” he says.</p>
    <p>“You def­i­nitely re­late to a char­ac­ter like Leroy, nav­i­gat­ing spa­ces that ba­si­cally had white peo­ple all the time.”</p>
    <p>In con­ver­sa­tions he had with the real-life Lo­gan, Boyega spoke about how he was able to de­code Lo­gan’s fa­cial ex­pres­sion in public­ity pho­to­graphs, which showed that the of­fi­cer was un­happy with how the force was treat­ing him, and copied it for the film.</p>
    <p>“I know what face to pull be­cause not ev­ery­one will get it, but my peo­ple will get it. Leroy said, ‘Yo, I was pi**ed at the time they were do­ing this’, and I un­der­stand how he was feel­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>The ac­tor’s frank­ness about be­ing side­lined by the Star Wars team is rare in a busi­ness that sab­o­tages the ca­reers of those who speak out, as the law­suits against ex­ec­u­tives that pro­voked the #MeToo move­ment have shown.</p>
    <p>Asked where his out­spo­ken­ness comes from, Boyega says forc­ing one­self to “morph to nav­i­gate com­pli­cated spa­ces” takes a toll on men­tal health.</p>
    <p>“You’re do­ing that Mon­day to Fri­day. It eats into your cre­ativ­ity, makes you dis­trust peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“I refuse to bend to fit in. I un­der­stand my priv­i­lege, but it is also my priv­i­lege to make sure I can be an ex­am­ple for those who are com­ing as well,” he adds.</p>
    <p>“I’m just me. For me, I have to speak up.”</p>
    <p>Red, White And Blue is the third film of the Small Axe an­thol­ogy minis­eries, now show­ing on BBC First (StarHub TV Chan­nel 502) and BBC Player. It will also be avail­able on de­mand.</p>
