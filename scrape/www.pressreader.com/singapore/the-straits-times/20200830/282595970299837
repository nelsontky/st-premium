    <p>Bones, of the chicken, pork and fish kind, have never been in such great de­mand.</p>
    <p>Af­ter hawker and restau­rant de­liv­ery, af­ter home-based food busi­nesses, the new “new thing” is broth.</p>
    <p>At least three com­pa­nies have sprung up re­cently sell­ing col­la­gen broth. Cus­tomers or­der and pay on­line, and the frozen pouches are de­liv­ered to them.</p>
    <p>These busi­nesses are dif­fer­ent from the likes of Beauty In The Pot and Mr Joy’s, which sell other hot­pot in­gre­di­ents, such as meat and fish­balls, for a com­plete hot­pot meal.</p>
    <p>Ao Broth, Chu Col­la­gen and Yuan Col­la­gen Soup sell only broth, which can be used in hot­pots and other dishes such as con­gee, risotto and dou­ble-boiled soup. Slow cook­ing ex­tracts col­la­gen from the bones, and the broth is wob­bly and jelly-like at room tem­per­a­ture.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies are bank­ing on the Sin­ga­porean love for hot soup – even in high hu­mid­ity and heat – to pro­pel their busi­nesses. All three started very re­cently: Chu in April, Yuan in June and Ao last month.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on the brand, cus­tomers pay $25 or $28 a litre for the broth. All three also of­fer bun­dle deals.</p>
    <p>The busi­nesses tap into t he zeit­geist of these pan­demic times. They are sell­ing a prod­uct that of­fers com­fort and which they say is free of monosodium glu­ta­mate and other ad­di­tives; that can be or­dered and de­liv­ered with min­i­mal hu­man con­tact; and that of­fers con­ve­nience to home cooks.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Yuan Col­la­gen Soup, started by Me­di­a­corp artist Chan­talle Ng, 25; and her friend Miny­ing Wong, 27, gen­eral man­ager of Asian Food­mall, a food court in Lucky Plaza; says: “We think that our on­line sales fo­cus has been tai­lored to the pan­demic. Had there not been a pan­demic, we might have done more of a retail push.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that be­cause of the pan­demic and the re­sult­ing weak econ­omy, peo­ple are more care­ful about what they spend on.”</p>
    <p>The two friends had been talk­ing about sell­ing Ms Wong’s chicken hot­pot broth for some time. The recipe is her grand­mother’s, but “no one had the time”. Then the cir­cuit breaker hap­pened and they could fo­cus on starting their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Mr Justin Aow, 33, a part­ner at Ao Broth – whose broth is made with garoupa, pork and chicken bones – had also pre­dicted the change in con­sumer be­haviour and pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>He says: “With t he shift i n con­sumer be­haviour and trends aris­ing from the pan­demic – such as work­ing from home, the cost of or­der­ing food de­liv­er­ies and seat­ing ca­pac­ity in restau­rants – cus­tomers have dif­fer­ent con­sid­er­a­tions now when it comes to de­cid­ing on din­ing and food choices.”</p>
    <p>Pan­demic con­sid­er­a­tions run in par­al­lel with other eat­ing trends.</p>
    <p>“In re­cent years, de­spite the fact that Sin­ga­pore­ans are lead­ing in­creas­ingly hec­tic lives, they still de­sire to eat healthily,” adds Mr Aow, cit­ing pop­u­lar di­etary plans such as the ke­to­genic diet, in­ter­mit­tent fast­ing and ve­g­an­ism.</p>
    <p>“The in­tent is clear: Cus­tomers to­day are be­com­ing more knowl­edge­able and dis­cern­ing with their eat­ing choices, and are con­stantly on the look­out for some­thing that fits their evolv­ing life­styles.”</p>
    <p>Mr Peter Lau, 35, who started Chu Col­la­gen with his wife, Ms Ethel Neo, 29, says: “When peo­ple are cooped up at home, they are more mo­ti­vated to try out new food prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“Eat­ing habits are chang­ing too. That helped, as peo­ple are cu­ri­ous and will­ing to try our broth.”</p>
    <p>The recipe for the chicken col­la­gen broth comes from Ms Neo. Mr Lau says: “My wife and I are al­ways look­ing for ways to repli­cate the taste of five-star restau­rant food at home. We love steam­boats, so my wife de­cided to cre­ate her own ver­sion of chicken col­la­gen soup from scratch.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter many tri­als, fail­ures and kilo­grams of chicken bones, she man­aged to pro­duce the best-tast­ing home­made col­la­gen soup there is.”</p>
    <p>All three com­pa­nies make the broth in com­mer­cial kitchens here. The stock is ei­ther blast-frozen in pouches or, in the case of Chu, frozen us­ing im­mer­sion cool­ing, which uses liq­uid rather than air to freeze the broth quickly.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies go through a lot of bones, sourced ei­ther from other busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore or re­gion­ally, but none would re­veal how many tonnes they use each month.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther Ao nor Chu would re­veal sales fig­ures, but Yuan says it sells about 1,000 litres of its chicken col­la­gen broth a month.</p>
    <p>Mr Lau of Chu Col­la­gen says: “What I can say is that the de­mand caught us by sur­prise and the num­ber of litres sold was be­yond our wildest imag­i­na­tion. Our vol­ume in­creased by 161 per cent from April to May. Our vol­ume con­tin­ues to grow by 5 to 15 per cent monthly.”</p>
    <p>All three com­pa­nies are ex­pand­ing. At the end of next month, Chu’s broth will retail at all FairPrice Finest su­per­mar­kets. There are also plans to sell the broth in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Mr Lau adds that the com­pany has had restau­rant own­ers ask­ing to use the broth in their dishes. In the first half of next month, his broth will be used in a new ra­men dish fea­tur­ing sea urchin, called Chu-Ni Broth Ra­men, at Takeshi Noo­dle Bar in Teck Lim Road.</p>
    <p>Yuan is look­ing to of­fer walk-in sales at the Asian Food­mall in Lucky Plaza and part­ner re­sellers to widen its reach.</p>
    <p>It also plans to col­lab­o­rate with other food and bev­er­age busi­nesses that sell com­ple­men­tary prod­ucts such as seafood. Also in the pipe­line are new broth flavours.</p>
    <p>Ao will launch two new broths next month: a prawn and pork broth that can be used for prawn noo­dles or bisque; and a clam and flower crab broth that can be used for hot­pots or pasta and risotto dishes.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion among these three com­pa­nies is not just sim­mer­ing, it is on a hard boil. It is only a mat­ter of time be­fore oth­ers jump into the fray.</p>
    <p>Yuan is well aware of what lies ahead. Its spokesman says: “We do re­alise that the bar­ri­ers to en­try for this busi­ness are quite low, and there will be a lot of com­pe­ti­tion. What we have as a North star are two things: a good prod­uct which we think is su­pe­rior in taste, qual­ity and value for money; and our de­vo­tion to our cus­tomers.”</p>
    <p>Ao’s Mr Aow says: “What sets us apart is our use of fish bones – in</p>
    <p>De­spite the fact that Sin­ga­pore­ans are lead­ing in­creas­ingly hec­tic lives, they still de­sire to eat healthily... Cus­tomers to­day are be­com­ing more knowl­edge­able and dis­cern­ing with their eat­ing choices, and are con­stantly on the look­out for some­thing that fits their evolv­ing life­styles. ’’ MR JUSTIN AOW, A PART­NER AT AO BROTH, on re­cent changes in con­sumer be­haviour and pref­er­ences</p>
    <p>par­tic­u­lar from the garoupa, which is con­sid­er­ably more pre­mium, ex­pen­sive and harder to source in large vol­umes. It keeps our broth re­ally low in fat and choles­terol, yet still thick with col­la­gen.”</p>
    <p>Chu’s Mr Lau says: “We em­brace com­pe­ti­tion as it mo­ti­vates us to do bet­ter. We be­lieve in ‘kaizen’, which is a Ja­panese busi­ness phi­los­o­phy for con­tin­u­ous im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>“In any busi­ness, we can­not stop com­peti­tors from en­ter­ing. But if we fo­cus on our cus­tomers and on con­tin­u­ously im­prov­ing our prod­uct and ser­vice, then I can say that we have a chance of com­mand­ing trust and re­spect in the mar­ket.”</p>
