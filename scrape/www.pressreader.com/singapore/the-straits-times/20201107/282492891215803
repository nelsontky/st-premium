    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) has called for changes in the way a com­po­nent of tower cranes used at con­struc­tion sites should be han­dled, af­ter an in­ci­dent last year led to the death of one worker and an in­jury to an­other.</p>
    <p>Erec­tion ropes used at tower cranes should be re­moved or dis­con­nected and stowed se­curely, said MOM, even as some crane man­u­fac­tur­ers al­low these ropes to re­main on cranes dur­ing op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>This was among the key rec­om­men­da­tions made in a re­port re­leased by the min­istry yes­ter­day, meant to en­cour­age the con­struc­tion in­dus­try to adopt lessons learnt from the ac­ci­dent and op­er­ate cranes more safely.</p>
    <p>On Nov 4 last year, a tower crane failed at a work­site in Tan Tock Seng Link as it was lift­ing around 300kg of scaf­fold­ing ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>The work­site, oc­cu­pied by Ka­jima Over­seas Asia, is for an up­com­ing re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion hub in Novena that will be part of Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>The cause of the fail­ure, said the re­port, was an en­tan­gled erec­tion rope pre­vent­ing the hor­i­zon­tal beam of the crane, called a jib, from be­ing low­ered fur­ther.</p>
    <p>When the rope even­tu­ally gave way and its hold on the jib re­leased, the jib then jerked down­wards into free fall, al­though it was held back by an­other rope and thus buck­led, said the re­port, de­tail­ing the se­quence of events that led to the fa­tal ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The re­port said the buck­ling hap­pened af­ter the jib started to fall and was not the cause of the ac­ci­dent. The crane was also not over­loaded at the time.</p>
    <p>The load and the hook block it was at­tached to fell and hit two work­ers.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported last year that the worker who was killed was 28-year-old In­dian na­tional Muthaiyan Vel­mu­ru­gan. The in­jured worker, who had a leg frac­ture, was a Bangladesh­i, then 35.</p>
    <p>Erec­tion ropes are typ­i­cally used to hold and bal­ance the jib in po­si­tion for it to be in­stalled on the top of the crane.</p>
    <p>The re­port noted that while some crane man­u­fac­tur­ers rec­om­mend erec­tion ropes be re­moved af­ter the jib is in­stalled, oth­ers do not, as not re­mov­ing the ropes makes main­te­nance of the jibs and dis­man­tling of cranes eas­ier.</p>
    <p>For ropes that are left on tower cranes af­ter the jib in­stal­la­tion, sup­port brack­ets are often used to con­tain and guide the ropes to their proper rest­ing po­si­tions, and pre­vent ex­ces­sive dan­gling when the jib is raised, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>MOM be­lieves this is the first recorded in­stance of such a tower crane fail­ure in­volv­ing erec­tion ropes in the world.</p>
    <p>“Hence, it is crit­i­cal to estab­lish the learn­ing points from the in­ci­dent to pre­vent re­cur­rence,” said the re­port.</p>
    <p>Af­ter con­sult­ing the in­dus­try, the min­istry rec­om­mended that erec­tion ropes should be re­moved or dis­con­nected and stowed se­curely on the crane af­ter the jib in­stal­la­tion, in spite of the ad­vice of some man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>“This is to elim­i­nate any risk of ac­ci­den­tal en­tan­gle­ment of the erec­tion ropes with any fixed struc­ture of the tower crane as the erec­tion ropes will not be in ten­sion even when the jib is low­ered.”</p>
    <p>It added that where erec­tion ropes are not re­moved or dis­con­nected, any sup­port brack­ets should be de­signed well to pre­vent un­in­tended slip­page dur­ing the rais­ing and low­er­ing of the jib. Reg­u­lar test­ing should be done to check if this is so.</p>
    <p>The cause of the fail­ure, said the MOM re­port, was an en­tan­gled erec­tion rope pre­vent­ing the hor­i­zon­tal beam of the crane, called a jib, from be­ing low­ered fur­ther.</p>
