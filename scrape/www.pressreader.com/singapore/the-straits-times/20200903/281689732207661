    <p>As Sin­ga­pore’s so­ci­ety evolves and its needs change, the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) will re­spond and adapt as it has al­ways done, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Set­ting out how suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tions of PAP lead­ers have de­vel­oped their own lead­er­ship styles and pol­icy pri­or­i­ties, he said he ex­pects the party’s fourth-gen­er­a­tion lead­er­ship will have to do the same.</p>
    <p>“My suc­ces­sors will have to do things in their own, dif­fer­ent ways too,” PM Lee said. “Es­tab­lish their own stand­ing, and build their own bonds with the next gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>The 4G lead­ers have been do­ing this for some time, and are now con­duct­ing the SG Together con­ver­sa­tions to get Sin­ga­pore­ans’ thoughts on how to take the coun­try for­ward, he added. “They want to ac­com­mo­date this grow­ing de­sire of Sin­ga­pore­ans not only to be heard, but to be in­volved.”</p>
    <p>He pointed out the PAP had “not stayed on top all these years by be­ing static, but by adapt­ing to (Sin­ga­pore’s) evolv­ing so­ci­ety and chang­ing needs”.</p>
    <p>Led by found­ing prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, Sin­ga­pore’s first­gen­er­a­tion lead­ers gov­erned in a “di­rect, no-non­sense way” which Sin­ga­pore­ans to­day would prob­a­bly find hard and un­com­pro­mis­ing.</p>
    <p>“You read the old speeches – the di­rect­ness, the force of the lan­guage – it makes you sit back and say: ‘God, could we say that to­day, in a dif­fer­ent way?’” PM Lee said. “The truths are the same; the pre­sen­ta­tion has to change with the zeit­geist.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s suc­ces­sor, Emer­i­tus Se­nior Minister Goh Chok Tong, had a dif­fer­ent touch. His team worked to bring peo­ple together and build a so­ci­etal con­sen­sus on the next lap of Sin­ga­pore’s growth.</p>
    <p>This was a con­trast to Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s ap­proach, but it was ap­pro­pri­ate for his gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans, and Mr Goh made it work, PM Lee noted.</p>
    <p>His own team is like nei­ther of its pre­de­ces­sors, and has found its own way to en­gage Sin­ga­pore­ans, he said. “We have gone through many ups and downs together over the last 16 years, and adapted and changed poli­cies to meet the new needs of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“By now, Sin­ga­pore­ans all know what I am like, and how I work. They have al­ways given me strong sup­port. And together, we have taken Sin­ga­pore an­other step for­ward.”</p>
    <p>The PAP has a “spe­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity” to make the sys­tem work and pro­vide the lead­er­ship Sin­ga­pore de­serves, the Prime Minister added.</p>
    <p>This re­spon­si­bil­ity is shared by no other po­lit­i­cal party, as the PAP is in­ex­tri­ca­bly linked with the coun­try’s found­ing, his­tory and de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Together with the party, Mr Lee Kuan Yew pledged that Sin­ga­pore would al­ways be a mul­tira­cial na­tion when it left Malaysia and be­came in­de­pen­dent, Dr Goh Keng Swee de­cided on na­tional ser­vice and helped to build the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces into the re­spected force it is to­day, and Mr S. Ra­jarat­nam penned the na­tional Pledge, PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>“We built this place together with Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he added. “These are among the rea­sons why the PAP has won ev­ery elec­tion since in­de­pen­dence. Sin­ga­pore­ans have trusted us, and we have never let them down.”</p>
