    <p>Since the slight eas­ing of rules for Covid-19 con­trol with the start of phase two, New­ton Food Cen­tre has at­tracted many cus­tomers, es­pe­cially at night.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the de­li­cious lo­cal cui­sine, al­co­hol is also a big draw ev­ery night. There ap­pears to be lit­tle ad­her­ence to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures. Also, af­ter 10.30pm on a typ­i­cal week­day, more than 60 pa­trons can be seen across dif­fer­ent ta­bles con­sum­ing al­co­hol, with some gath­er­ing in groups of more than five. I have even no­ticed some con­sum­ing al­co­hol be­yond mid­night.</p>
    <p>On Fri­days and week­ends, the num­ber of pa­trons in­fring­ing guide­lines eas­ily dou­bles.</p>
    <p>I have fed this back to the au­thor­i­ties on sev­eral oc­ca­sions over the last two months, but lit­tle ap­pears to have been done to fix the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The ac­tions of these groups of peo­ple pose a real risk of new Covid-19 clus­ters form­ing.</p>
    <p>While most stalls are do­ing their best to com­ply with the law by not sell­ing al­co­hol af­ter 10.30pm, what they (both stall­hold­ers and the man­age­ment of New­ton Food Cen­tre) fail to do is to in­form pa­trons that they’ll have to cease drink­ing by 10.30pm, which is the re­spon­si­bil­ity of liquor li­cence-hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Last week, there were re­ports of sev­eral restau­rants and cof­fee shops be­ing or­dered to close af­ter pa­trons were spot­ted con­sum­ing al­co­hol on their premises af­ter 10.30pm. So they do have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to en­sure that such con­sump­tion ends by 10.30pm.</p>
    <p>I hope that the rel­e­vant agen­cies will take firm and de­ci­sive ac­tion to clamp down on these bla­tant acts. Steve Wee Yan Loong</p>
