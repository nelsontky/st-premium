    <p>The bod­ies were dis­cov­ered at the south-eastern English port of Pur­fleet af­ter be­ing sealed in­side the con­tainer for at least 12 hours, in un­bear­ably high tem­per­a­tures. A foren­sic ex­pert cal­cu­lated it would have taken about nine hours for the air to turn toxic in the trailer.</p>

    <p>LON­DON Two key de­fen­dants ac­cused of man­slaugh­ter and peo­ple smug­gling af­ter the grue­some dis­cov­ery of 39 dead Viet­namese mi­grants in the back of a lorry in Eng­land were found guilty yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The bod­ies of the men and women were found in a con­tainer near Lon­don in Oc­to­ber last year af­ter suf­fo­cat­ing in swel­ter­ing tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>All were aged be­tween 15 and 44. Lorry driver Ea­monn Har­ri­son, 24, from North­ern Ire­land, and Ro­ma­nian na­tional Ghe­o­rghe Nica, 43, were found guilty of 39 counts of man­slaugh­ter by a Lon­don court af­ter a 10-week trial.</p>
    <p>They are ex­pected to be sen­tenced early next month.</p>
    <p>Christo­pher Kennedy, 24, and Valentin Calota, 38, were also con­victed for their part in the smug­gling op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>All four were found guilty over their roles in a lu­cra­tive smug­gling ring which pros­e­cu­tors said had been mo­ti­vated by greed.</p>
    <p>It brings the to­tal num­ber found guilty in Bri­tain in con­nec­tion with the crime to eight. Pros­e­cu­tors are con­sid­er­ing charges against a fur­ther three peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mau­rice Robin­son, 26, who col­lected the con­tainer and found the bod­ies, had al­ready pleaded guilty to 39 counts of man­slaugh­ter and to con­spir­ing in peo­ple-smug­gling.</p>
    <p>Haulage firm boss Ro­nan</p>
    <p>Hughes, 41, has also ad­mit­ted to 39 man­slaugh­ter charges.</p>
    <p>The bod­ies were dis­cov­ered at the south-eastern English port of Pur­fleet af­ter be­ing sealed in­side the con­tainer for at least 12 hours, in un­bear­ably high tem­per­a­tures.</p>
    <p>A foren­sic ex­pert cal­cu­lated it would have taken about nine hours for the air to turn toxic in the trailer, with death com­ing soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said the trapped</p>
    <p>Viet­namese were un­able to get a phone sig­nal in­side the con­tainer, whose cool­ing sys­tem was turned off.</p>
    <p>Mo­bile phones re­cov­ered from the bod­ies of the 39 vic­tims showed that they had tried to raise the alarm and left mes­sages for the fam­i­lies as they ran out of air.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers had used a metal pole to try to punch a hole through the roof or at­tract at­ten­tion, the court heard.</p>
