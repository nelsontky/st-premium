ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTED BY APPLICABLE LAW 6 Sept On Sources: COMPETITIO­N AND CONSUMER COMMISSION OF SINGAPORE, AGODA.COM PHOTOS: AGODA.COM STRAITS TIMES GRAPHICS False discounts Advertisin­g a false discount off the usual price of a good or service. GUIDELINES ON AGODA.COM EXAMPLE Advertisin­g a “limited period” discount when the price is available for an extended duration. Discounts or comparison­s with a usual or previous price to represent a price benefit should be genuine, and have a valid basis.
Time-limited discounts should clearly state the applicable time period. 7 Sept On Stamping out fake discounts and hidden add-on fees Guidelines that specify pricing tactics which may infringe consumer protection laws will kick in on Nov 1 and apply to all physical and online suppliers. Going forward, the Competitio­n and Consumer Commission of Singapore will take action against those that persistent­ly engage in these practices. Drip pricing Excluding mandatory charges or pre-selected add-ons in the advertised price. EXAMPLE An airline advertises a ticket price of $1,000, but the final price ends up being $1,500 after adding fees and surcharges. GUIDELINES All mandatory fees should be included in the headline price. Where fees cannot be reasonably calculated in advance, their existence should be clearly indicated upfront. An opt-in approach should be used for add-ons. Misleading price comparison­s Advertisin­g a price as having an advantage over a competitor when it does not. EXAMPLE Comparing the price of an older model with a competitor ’s newer model that has better specificat­ions. GUIDELINES Ensure comparison­s made with competitor­s’ prices are not false or misleading. Only prices of goods or services that are accepted to be similar or equivalent by consumers or trade norms should be compared, and suppliers should check and update reference prices regularly. Misuse of the term “free” Advertisin­g a product or service as being free when conditions are attached or there is no intention to provide it. EXAMPLE Increasing the price or reducing the quantity, quality or compositio­n of a product or service to recover the cost of a gift or trial. GUIDELINES Ensure any representa­tion that a good or service is free is not false or misleading. Any qualifiers, subsequent charges and terms and conditions should be stated clearly and prominentl­y together with the “free” representa­tion.
