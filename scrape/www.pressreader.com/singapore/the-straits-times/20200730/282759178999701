    <p>ROME • The Venice Film Fes­ti­val will put the ac­cent on home-grown Ital­ian cin­ema in Septem­ber among its eclec­tic of­fer­ing of in­ter­na­tional films, as the pres­ti­gious fes­ti­val in its 77th year faces un­prece­dented chal­lenges in the time of coron­avirus.</p>
    <p>In a chaotic year that has seen the can­cel­la­tion of ri­val com­pe­ti­tions, shut­tered fil m pro­duc­tion and closed movie the­atres across the globe, the fes­ti­val in Italy’s beloved canal city will pro­ceed from Sept 2 to 12 with 18 films vy­ing for the top award, the Golden Lion.</p>
    <p>Au­teurs with films in the main com­pe­ti­tion hail from Mex­ico, Azer­bai­jan, Is­rael, Russia, Iran, Ja­pan, and In­dia, among other coun­tries, or­gan­is­ers said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“Cin­ema has not been over­whelmed by the tsunami of the pan­demic but re­tains an en­vi­able vi­tal­ity,” said fes­ti­val di­rec­tor Al­berto Bar­bera.</p>
    <p>At the same time, he warned that some “spec­tac­u­lar ti­tles” would be miss­ing, still blocked by on­go­ing lock­downs around the world.</p>
    <p>Even so, “the heart of the fes­ti­val is saved”, Mr Bar­bera said.</p>
    <p>PA­PARAZZI-FREE?</p>
    <p>Four of the main com­pe­ti­tion films are Ital­ian – Le Sorella Ma­caluso, from di­rec­tor Emma Dante, who made her Venice de­but in 2012; Clau­dio Noce’s Pa­drenos­tro, about Italy’s wave of ter­ror­ism in the 1970s seen through chil­dren’s eyes; Not­turno by 2013 Golden Lion win­ner Gian­franco Rosi, which was shot over two years in Syria; and Miss Marx, by Su­sanna Nic­chiarelli, about Ger­man philoso­pher Karl Marx’s youngest daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>The high­est-pro­file film in com­pe­ti­tion, which has al­ready got some Os­car buzz, is Amer­i­can di­rec­tor Chloe Zhao’s No­mad­land, star­ring two-time Best Ac­tress Os­car win­ner Frances McDor­mand and Academy Award Best Ac­tor nom­i­nee David Strathairn.</p>
    <p>Open­ing the fes­ti­val, but out of com­pe­ti­tion, will be Ital­ian di­rec­tor Daniele Luchetti’s Lacci (The Ties), a fea­ture set in Naples about a mar­riage threat­ened by in­fi­delity, the first time in over a decade that Venice’s open­ing film has been Ital­ian.</p>
    <p>The Bi­en­nale di Venezia, as it is called in Ital­ian, has taken on out­sized im­por­tance this year as film fes­ti­vals across the globe have been can­celled, in­clud­ing Venice’s main com­peti­tor, the glam­orous Cannes Film Fes­ti­val on the Cote d’Azur, orig­i­nally planned for May.</p>
    <p>Although fa­mil­iar scenes of throngs of pa­parazzi snap­ping pho­to­graphs of A-lis­ters on the red car­pet and scream­ing fans be­hind bar­ri­cades hop­ing for au­to­graphs from their favourite stars may be un­likely, this year’s fes­ti­val prom­ises to of­fer a wide range of film styles, in­clud­ing au­teur, hor­ror and gang­ster films, doc­u­men­taries as well as come­dies.</p>
    <p>‘SIGN OF RE­COV­ERY’</p>
    <p>Films from more than 50 coun­tries will be screened at the fes­ti­val, and of the 18 movies com­pet­ing for the Golden Lion, eight are di­rected by women.</p>
    <p>This year, Aus­tralian ac­tress Cate Blanchett is the pres­i­dent of the jury for the main com­pe­ti­tion and French di­rec­tor Claire De­nis will lead the jury for the fes­ti­val’s Hori­zons com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val will give life­time achieve­ment awards to Bri­tish ac­tress Tilda Swin­ton and Hong Kong film-maker Ann Hui.</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val’s pres­i­dent, Mr Roberto Ci­cutto, told re­porters that this year’s of­fer­ing “has not re­nounced quan­tity nor the num­ber of movies in the of­fi­cial se­lec­tion”.</p>
    <p>“This is a sign of re­cov­ery... It’s like a lab­o­ra­tory, a test of how such an im­por­tant event can be or­gan­ised,” he said, adding that safety mea­sures would i nclude empty seats be­tween movie­go­ers, tem­per­a­tures taken at en­trances and on­line-only tick­ets.</p>
    <p>Other fes­ti­vals can­celled this year in­clude the Tel­luride Film Fes­ti­val in Colorado, New York’s Tribeca Film Fes­ti­val and South by South­west in Austin, Texas.</p>
    <p>Cannes, the high­est-pro­file fes­ti­val to can­cel, will be­stow a “Cannes 2020” la­bel on se­lected films that would have been shown on the Croisette in May but which will now pre­miere at other fes­ti­vals.</p>
