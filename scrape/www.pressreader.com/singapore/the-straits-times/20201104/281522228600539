    <p>Amer­i­cans cast their votes yes­ter­day in a high-stakes pres­i­den­tial election that could see Republican Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump se­cure another four years in of­fice, or his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den seize the White House.</p>
    <p>Trail­ing Mr Bi­den in na­tional opin­ion polls, Mr Trump is seek­ing to avoid be­com­ing the first in­cum­bent pres­i­dent to lose re-election since fel­low Republican Ge­orge H.W. Bush in 1992.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to Fox News yes­ter­day, Mr Trump said he ex­pected vic­tory in all the key states that will de­cide the election.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den posted a video mes­sage on his Twitter feed and urged his sup­port­ers: “To­day, vote for a new day in Amer­ica.”</p>
    <p>Or­di­nar­ily, ma­jor TV net­works and news out­lets have been able to call the race be­fore an of­fi­cial an­nounce­ment, based on exit polls the day after the election.</p>
    <p>This time, how­ever, un­cer­tainty looms, as the re­sults may take days or weeks after a record num­ber of mail-in bal­lots due to the pan­demic. Fur­ther de­lays may also oc­cur if ab­sen­tee vot­ing rules are con­tested in court.</p>
    <p>The chances of the re­sults be­ing dis­puted are lower if ei­ther can­di­date ap­pears to be headed for a big vic­tory, but if bal­lots counted later swing the con­test in favour of the Democrats, Mr Trump may fol­low through on his threat of not ac­cept­ing the re­sults.</p>
    <p>In a sign of how volatile the election could be, build­ings in sev­eral cities were boarded up and the Na­tional Guard was on standby for the pos­si­bil­ity of vi­o­lent un­rest.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans voted yes­ter­day in an election that was al­ready half over. Be­fore the polling sta­tions opened, nearly 100 mil­lion vot­ers had had their say in early or mail-in vot­ing, which is more than two-thirds of the to­tal num­ber of votes cast in the 2016 election that brought Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to power.</p>
    <p>It is safe to say that the turnout, that has ranged from 50 to 57 per cent in elec­tions since 2000, will be one for the record books. It could be the stuff of land­slides even, over­whelm­ing the election ma­chin­ery, cre­at­ing snaking, restive queues and a painfully long ges­ta­tion pe­riod for re­sults.</p>
    <p>In the key bat­tle­ground states where con­tests are close, mailedin votes may de­cide the win­ners. It is not clear how long this might take: Some states spec­ify that the sig­na­ture on the postal bal­lot must tally with reg­is­tra­tion records to en­sure the vote is authen­tic, and if it does not, the voter gets ex­tra days to cor­rect it. Other states ex­am­ine post­marks, of­ten smudgy, to check whether the vote ar­rived on or be­fore Nov 3.</p>
    <p>Add to that sce­nario Mr Trump’s as­ser­tion that the vot­ing by mail is fraud-prone and tem­pers can flare for more rea­sons than de­lays in the cast­ing or count­ing of votes.</p>
    <p>In prepa­ra­tion, the White House perime­ter was for­ti­fied with a tall fence and shops nearby boarded up, while the Na­tional Guard stood ready. Mili­tias, right-wing and left, were re­port­edly mo­bil­is­ing and news out­lets equipped re­porters in some bat­tle­ground states with flak jack­ets, tac­ti­cal hel­mets and gas masks. The Straits Times US bu­reau chief Nir­mal Ghosh bought a bul­let­proof vest.</p>
    <p>While na­tional opin­ion polls had sign­posted a sta­ble lead for Mr Bi­den , a nar­row path to vic­tory re­mained for Mr Trump, whose fran­tic cam­paign­ing in the states that he car­ried in the last election could pave the way for his come­back.</p>
    <p>The last election was not par­tic­u­larly pleas­ant. Trump ral­lies rang with “lock her up” chants di­rected at chal­lenger Hil­lary Clin­ton for wrong­do­ing that was never clear.</p>
    <p>But the di­vi­sive­ness be­came a yawn­ing chasm in this election. Mr Trump’s third year in of­fice saw the largest de­gree of po­lit­i­cal po­lar­i­sa­tion in any pres­i­den­tial year mea­sured by Gallup. Some 89 per cent of Repub­li­cans ap­proved of his per­for­mance in of­fice in 2019; only 7 per cent of Democrats thought he was do­ing a good job. A Pew Re­search Cen­tre sur­vey this year found that 47 per cent of Repub­li­cans and 71 per cent of Democrats said they “wouldn’t want to date some­one who voted for the can­di­date of the op­pos­ing party in the 2016 pres­i­den­tial election”.</p>
    <p>For­mer pres­i­dent Barack Obama, cam­paign­ing for Mr Bi­den on Mon­day, called Mr Trump’s hop­scotch ral­lies across swing states a “Covid spreader tour”, in a scathing at­tack on his han­dling of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis that has seen the US record the world’s high­est num­ber of cases and deaths.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, never one to hold back on dem­a­gogic hy­per­bole, tweeted yes­ter­day: “A vote for Sleepy Joe Bi­den is a vote to give con­trol of gov­ern­ment over to Glob­al­ists, Com­mu­nists, So­cial­ists, and Wealthy Lib­eral Hyp­ocrites who want to si­lence, cen­sor, can­cel, and pun­ish you.”</p>
    <p>The months-long cam­paign gave pause to watch­ers in Asia who fol­low the can­di­dates’ pro­nounce­ments on trade, se­cu­rity and for­eign pol­icy. The first pres­i­den­tial de­bate will be re­mem­bered chiefly for the un­seemly ran­cour.</p>
    <p>“Will you shut up, man,” Mr Bi­den said after be­ing in­ter­rupted re­peat­edly by Mr Trump. “There’s noth­ing smart about you, Joe,” was Mr Trump’s me­morable line.</p>
    <p>Other strains on the sys­tem are showing. Top US na­tional se­cu­rity of­fi­cials said last month that Iran and Rus­sia had gained ac­cess to voter reg­is­tra­tion data to in­ter­fere in the US elec­tions, send­ing spoof e-mails to some vot­ers and spread­ing dis­in­for­ma­tion on­line.</p>
    <p>The hall­mark free­dom of ex­pres­sion is also un­der chal­lenge. Twitter and Face­book said they would at­tach warning la­bels on posts from can­di­dates who claimed vic­tory pre­ma­turely. It is a dilemma for the me­dia too. Mr Trump was re­port­edly pre­par­ing to make a vic­tory speech if he es­tab­lished a lead in the closely con­tested bat­tle­ground states while large num­bers of mailed-in bal­lots re­mained to be counted. The me­dia would then have to make a call on how to re­port his speech, aware that it might be a mis­lead­ing claim with po­ten­tial to stoke vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>As the fraught and un­pre­dictable race wound to a close, the Wash­ing­ton Post had a one-word ad­vice for those trans­mit­ting the news and those who con­sume it: Pa­tience.</p>
