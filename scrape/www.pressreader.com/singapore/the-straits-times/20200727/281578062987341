    <p>For­eign PGA Tour golfers now need not quar­an­tine them­selves in the United States for two weeks, but that will not en­tice some like former world No. 1 Lee West­wood to fly there to play. The 47-year-old English­man says he is slightly asth­matic and is con­cerned about trav­el­ling as the US is still a coronaviru­s hot spot.</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The United States has scrapped its 14-day quar­an­tine re­quire­ment for over­seas PGA Tour golfers but that is not enough to con­vince former world No. 1 Lee West­wood to get on an air­plane and fly to Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>The US fed­eral govern­ment de­cided on Fri­day that pro­fes­sional golfers no longer have to quar­an­tine for two weeks be­cause the PGA Tour has put in place nu­mer­ous health mea­sures such as reg­u­lar test­ing for the coronaviru­s.</p>
    <p>The lift­ing of the re­stric­tions opens the door for trav­el­ling nonAmer­i­cans to en­ter the PGA Cham­pi­onship – the first Ma­jor of this year – in San Fran­cisco on Aug 6 and this week’s WGC-FedEx St Jude In­vi­ta­tional in Ten­nessee.</p>
    <p>But the at­trac­tion of play­ing in a Ma­jor is not enough to sway English­man West­wood, who said that he is wor­ried about the way the US is han­dling the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I don’t feel it is right to jump on a plane for 12 hours,” the 47-year-old told re­porters on Satur­day at the Bri­tish Masters, where he ended last in the 70-man field. “I’m still con­cerned that Amer­ica doesn’t take it (the virus) as se­ri­ously as the rest of the world. It still seems to be one of the hot spots for out­breaks.”</p>
    <p>The pol­icy change also af­fects in­com­ing cad­dies and other es­sen­tial golf per­son­nel en­ter­ing the US. The play­ers were no­ti­fied on Fri­day in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>West­wood added that he suf­fers from ex­er­cise-in­duced asthma.</p>
    <p>“I’m slightly asth­matic. If I tested (pos­i­tive) in Mem­phis I would have to stay there for two weeks. Right now there are too many ifs,” he said.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica leads t he world i n Covid-19 cases with 4.17 mil­lion and deaths with over 146,000, ac­cord­ing to Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity. Mem­phis has 265 deaths and al­most 18,000 cases, while San Fran­cisco has more than 50 deaths and over 5,700 cases.</p>
    <p>The PGA Tour has had nine play­ers and cad­dies test pos­i­tive since it restarted at the be­gin­ning of June with­out fans in at­ten­dance up till it con­ducted pre-tour­na­ment screen­ing ahead of the 3M Open. At the 3M Open on Satur­day, Richy Weren­ski and Michael Thompson found them­selves knotted atop the leader­board for the sec­ond day in a row, with the two Amer­i­cans poised to set­tle the score in yes­ter­day’s final round in Blaine, Min­nesota.</p>
    <p>Weren­ski sank a long putt on the par-five 18th for birdie to fin­ish level with Thompson, as both play­ers carded third-round 68s to sit on 15-under 198 for the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>“It’s def­i­nitely good to have a strong fin­ish like that,” Weren­ski said. “I did a good job of just kind of hang­ing in there, grind­ing along, giv­ing my­self looks.”</p>
    <p>South Africa’s Charl Schwartzel</p>
    <p>FAR FROM COM­FORT­ABLE</p>
    <p>I’m still con­cerned that Amer­ica doesn’t take it (the virus) as se­ri­ously as the rest of the world. It still seems to be one of the hot spots for out­breaks.</p>
    <p>’’ LEE WEST­WOOD, English golfer, on skip­ping this week’s WGC event and next week’s PGA Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>(66) and in-form Amer­i­can Tony Finau (69) lurked two strokes back.</p>
    <p>Thompson, who adopted a baby girl just as the pan­demic be­gan to take hold, said he felt blessed to have ex­tra time with his daugh­ter dur­ing the PGA Tour’s hia­tus.</p>
    <p>“It was re­ally a joy for me to be able to stay home those first three months of her life and re­ally get to care for her and learn her lit­tle nu­ances and see her smile,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It def­i­nitely puts per­spec­tive in your mind when you have kids, be­cause golf is very im­por­tant and it’s what I love to do, but our kids are what we live for.”</p>
