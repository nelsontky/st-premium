    <p>McRefugees, the peo­ple who bed down nightly in Hong Kong’s 24-hour fast-food restau­rants, have been a so­cial phe­nom­e­non in the city for a decade. They made the news again this year when so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules forced 24-hour restau­rants to switch to take­out only and close at 6pm, forc­ing hun­dreds of them into the streets. Hong Kong drama I’m Livin’ It is set in one such com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>A few years ago, the folk who bed down nightly i n Hong Kong’s 24-hour fast-food restau­rants made the news here when it was dis­cov­ered that there was a Sin­ga­porean woman among them. She had fallen vic­tim to a scam in China and was too ashamed to come home.</p>
    <p>McRefugees, as they have come to be known, have been a so­cial phe­nom­e­non i n the city for a decade.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey re­leased last year by the So­ci­ety for Com­mu­nity Or­gan­i­sa­tions in Hong Kong, there were 1,270 reg­is­tered street sleep­ers by the end of 2018 – up from 780 in 2013. Nearly 40 per cent of them were stay­ing overnight at McDon­ald’s out­lets.</p>
    <p>McRefugees made the news again this year when so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules forced 24-hour restau­rants to switch to take­out only and close at 6pm, forc­ing hun­dreds of them into the streets.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong drama I’m Livin’ It, now show­ing in cin­e­mas, is set in one such com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Wong Hing Fan, 51, tells The Straits Times i n an e-mail in­ter­view that he had hoped to show that not all those who sleep in cafes are des­ti­tute.</p>
    <p>Rather, many are the work­ing poor, hold­ing low-pay­ing j obs – of­ten, more than one – yet un­able to af­ford rent or have in­comes si­phoned into debt pay­ments.</p>
    <p>Those who see the McRefugees as lazy or averse to hard work fail to un­der­stand the com­pet­i­tive na­ture of life in the city, Wong notes.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kongers work hard, whether they are rich or poor. Hard work is es­sen­tial for sur­vival. Lazy per­sons are weeded out over time,” he adds.</p>
    <p>The film’s char­ac­ters i nclude Mama (Cya Liu), an un­doc­u­mented</p>
    <p>mi­grant from China; Un­cle Wait (Alex Man), a wid­ower who can­not bear sleep­ing alone in his flat with the mem­ory of his dead wife; and Sam (Zeno Koo), a teenager dis­tanc­ing him­self from a toxic fam­ily sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>With the help of the re­source­ful big brother fig­ure of Bowen, played by Aaron Kwok, they form a de facto fam­ily. Miriam Ye­ung plays Jane, a good-hearted lounge singer who helps Bowen out of tough sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“It takes a multi-faceted per­spec­tive to com­plete a story. There are many sto­ries about McRefugees. When choos­ing what to in­clude, I chose the el­e­ments that spoke to me,” says Wong, who makes his fea­ture film de­but with I’m Livin’ It.</p>
    <p>The film earned 10 nom­i­na­tions at the Hong Kong Film Awards in April, in­clud­ing for Best Film, and was se­lected for the Asian Fu­ture sec­tion of the Tokyo In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val last year.</p>
    <p>The screen­play is by Ja Poon (ro­man­tic com­edy A Beau­ti­ful Mo­ment, 2018).</p>
    <p>With the help of so­cial work­ers, Wong’s team went in search of authen­tic sto­ries.</p>
    <p>“From speak­ing with them, we found a per­son who loves to help other McRefugees find jobs. This trait can be seen in Aaron’s char­ac­ter, who be­lieves the poor must help one an­other,” Wong says.</p>
    <p>While it might be tough to find af­ford­able hous­ing, Hong Kong is not a place with­out heart. In com</p>
    <p>mu­nity fridges, Bowen and friends find food and drink do­nated by ven­dors and mem­bers of the pub­lic. Char­i­ta­ble or­gan­i­sa­tions dis­trib­ute packed lunches to se­niors.</p>
    <p>The do­na­tions al­low cafe dwellers to pool their mea­gre re­sources to es­cape their predicamen­t. With­out such a boost, they might stag­nate and their tem­po­rary homes un­der the golden arches might be­come per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>“When you are poor, you have to wait and hope. McRefugees can turn their life around only if they leave the 24-hour fast-food res­tau­rant,” Wong says.</p>
    <p>Hong Kongers work hard, whether they are rich or poor. Hard work is es­sen­tial for sur­vival. Lazy per­sons are weeded out over time.</p>
    <p>DI­REC­TOR WONG HING FAN, who says those who see the McRefugees as lazy fail to un­der­stand the com­pet­i­tive na­ture of life in the city</p>
    <p>I’m Livin’ It is show­ing in cin­e­mas.</p>
