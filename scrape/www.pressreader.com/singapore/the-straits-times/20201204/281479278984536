    <p>A 38-year-old woman was charged yes­ter­day over her al­leged in­volve­ment in the death of her former boyfriend.</p>
    <p>Alverna Cher Sheue Pin, who ap­peared in court via video link, faces a charge of cul­pa­ble homi­cide not amount­ing to mur­der.</p>
    <p>She is said to have caused the death of Mr Wee Jun Xiang at the multi-storey carpark at Block 145A Be­dok Reser­voir Road be­tween 1.44pm and 5.15pm on May 16.</p>
    <p>The 32-year-old man’s body was found at the carpark on the same day at about 5.30pm.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Wed­nes­day, the po­lice said Cher be­came a sus­pect dur­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions and was later ar­rested.</p>
    <p>An on­line search showed that she is a fu­neral di­rec­tor at City Fu­neral Sin­ga­pore and the founder of the Care plan­ner cer­ti­fi­ca­tion pro­gramme, which trains in­di­vid­u­als in mat­ters such as the draft­ing of wills and fu­neral plan­ning.</p>
    <p>Cher told the court that she is a sin­gle mother with two daugh­ters,</p>
    <p>aged 13 and six, as well as the sole bread­win­ner of her fam­ily. She also pro­vides for her par­ents.</p>
    <p>In a blog post pub­lished four days be­fore Mr Wee’s body was found, Cher said she was di­vorced from the fa­ther of the older child and that the fa­ther of the younger child had been sen­tenced to jail shortly af­ter the child was born.</p>
    <p>She said she in­her­ited a fu­neral busi­ness and debts from the younger child’s fa­ther.</p>
    <p>She man­aged to con­vince the man’s cred­i­tor to ac­cept pay­ments in in­stal­ments, and had closed the busi­ness and set up a sim­i­lar one un­der her own name, she added.</p>
    <p>She also talked about jug­gling her fam­ily du­ties with her busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“Look­ing back, I am proud of what we’ve ac­com­plished as a fam­ily. I man­aged to make a name for my­self in the fu­neral in­dus­try, serv­ing many fam­i­lies and do­ing pro bono work for ba­bies and the needy,” she said.</p>
    <p>In court yes­ter­day, Cher re­quested to make three phone calls – one to her fam­ily, an­other to have a friend pass them money, and an­other to help her en­gage a lawyer.</p>
    <p>The district judge said the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer would help to no­tify the fam­ily and make ar­range­ments re­lat­ing to their wel­fare.</p>
    <p>Cher’s case will be heard again next Thurs­day. She is cur­rently in re­mand.</p>
    <p>When The Straits Times went to her flat in Pung­gol yes­ter­day, no one an­swered the door.</p>
    <p>A neigh­bour, who de­clined to be named, said she had not seen Cher or her two daugh­ters since the start of the school hol­i­days last month.</p>
    <p>At Mr Wee’s flat in Be­dok Reser­voir Road, a woman who ap­peared to be in her 60s an­swered the door and said she was his mother.</p>
    <p>The woman de­clined to be in­ter­viewed.</p>
    <p>If found guilty of cul­pa­ble homi­cide not amount­ing to mur­der, Cher could face life in prison, or be jailed for up to 20 years and fined.</p>
