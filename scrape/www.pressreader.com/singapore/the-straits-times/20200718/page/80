    <p>
        4 | SATURDAY, JULY 18, 2020 SCHOLARS’ CHOICE: SECURE YOUR FUTURE NOW Creating a sustainabl­e future A*STAR Graduate Scholarshi­p recipient Dr Daniel Ong is motivated to build a better world for all A s a scientist, Dr Daniel Ong hopes to leave a better world for future generation­s.
“Imagine earth as an egg. Once you break it, it’s broken. You cannot unbreak it. This is what will happen if excessive carbon dioxide continues to be released and not enough is done to combat the issue,” explains the 40-year-old father of two.
He does his part by starting at home — he teaches his children how to prevent wasting water, electricit­y and food, as well as to recycle whenever possible.
He says: “It is never too early to start educating the next generation to play their part in sustaining our earth, our home.”
On a grander scale, Dr Ong contribute­s to sustainabi­lity efforts through his work as the head of strategy management at A*STAR’s Institute of Chemical and Engineerin­g Sciences (ICES). He is working closely with the Urban and Green Tech Office (UGTO), which is responsibl­e for the decarbonis­ation (carbon emission reduction) and sustainabi­lity efforts of A*STAR.
The UGTO leverages technologi­cal advancemen­ts developed by A*STAR research institutes and the wider research and developmen­t (R&D) ecosystem. Dr Ong says being part of this initiative not only enables him to drive activities and engagement­s in sustainabi­lity efforts, but also allows him to collaborat­e with multi-disciplina­ry research institutes at A*STAR. and multi-use waxes. These technologi­es, together with complement­ary strategies in biodegrada­bility and recyclabil­ity, will play an integral part in carbon capture, utilisatio­n and storage efforts in future — while enabling Singapore to play a key role to drive active carbon management.
After four years in front line research, Dr Ong moved to an innovation and strategy management role within ICES in 2018.
Today, he oversees the institute’s key programmes and initiative­s, as well as its portfolio of R&D activities. His role is to map and align ICES’ innovation target areas in the space of decarbonis­ation, sustainabi­lity and circular economy, specialty chemicals and the future of chemicals manufactur­ing. A*STAR Graduate Scholarshi­p CRITERIA: Singaporea­ns and other nationals intending to take up Singapore citizenshi­p; must satisfy the criteria for and seek admission to a PhD programme in a Singapore autonomous university; they should have obtained at least a 2nd Upper Class Honours Degree or equivalent in relevant discipline­s; and have a strong interest in a research career VALUE OF THE AWARD: Full tuition fees; monthly sustenance allowance, inclusive of CPF contributi­on (where applicable); other allowances including book allowance, computer allowance, conference allowance, thesis allowance; support for up to 12 months of overseas attachment; AGS awardees are also eligible for the AGS (PDF) for overseas post-doctoral training after completion of their PhD studies Working for future generation­s Dr Ong says challenges will always appear in any academic and profession­al pursuit. But what keeps him going is the support and kindness that he receives from his superiors, leaders and colleagues.
Dr Ong aspires to pay it forward in a future role where he can nurture talents and inspire them in a similar way to what he has experience­d.
“I’ve always felt that science underpins the progress of society. I hope to play a part in it as much as I can,” he says.
He encourages aspiring scientists to pursue their passion for the greater good, “The future is yours. Seize it with fervour, and strive to create an even brighter future for those who will come after you!” BOND PERIOD: No service commitment for Singaporea­ns; twoyear service commitment period in Singaporeb­ased companies in the areas of biomedical sciences, physical sciences or engineerin­g for non-Singaporea­ns; AGS awardees who are subsequent­ly awarded the AGS (PDF) for overseas post-doctoral training will have a three-year service commitment period Dr Daniel Ong is running a reactor that helps A*STAR to convert carbon dioxide into useful and sustainabl­e chemicals, as well as fuel energy.                           Before taking on the role of ICES’ head of strategy management, Dr Ong worked on industry-facing projects and collaborat­ed with a team of fellow scientists and engineers to develop technologi­es for converting carbon dioxide into reusable fuels and everyday items such as recyclable plastic materials Ong says he had to put in extra time to truly understand the subjects over the course of his studies. However, he held onto the belief that “if something is worth getting, it is worth every effort”. The scientist is also thankful for the support of close-knit family and friends in his learning journey. helped him to pursue his passion for science and research.
Dr Ong majored in physics for his bachelor’s degree and pursued a PhD degree in chemical and biomolecul­ar engineerin­g under the AGS. He also has a master of science in finance.
He admits that the road to learning is not an easy one. Dr Teamwork makes the dream work As an A*STAR Graduate Scholarshi­p (AGS) recipient, Dr Daniel Ong was given opportunit­ies and exposure to varied research roles within A*STAR. The scholarshi­p and the support he received has Exercising empathy towards the vulnerable These ranged from teaching English and computer literacy skills to the elderly, to cleaning and painting the homes of low-income families. Each time, she found it meaningful to help those in need.
When in junior college, a road traffic accident involving her family members further piqued her interest in the local healthcare sector. As she interacted with the hospital’s multi-disciplina­ry team of doctors, nurses, therapists, and a medical social worker, she began to understand how the different roles worked together to support the family.
She was particular­ly struck by how the medical social worker helped her family to cope, by addressing their individual needs and medical concerns throughout that episode.
After her A levels, Ms Chan chanced upon the Healthcare Merit Award in a scholarshi­p guide and found herself drawn to it.
“It seemed like the perfect opportunit­y to pursue my interests,” she explains.
“At that age, I was not completely sure if I had what it takes to be a medical social worker, but I wanted to give it a try.”
She was given the Healthcare Merit Award in 2013, began her degree in social work at the National University of Singapore shortly after, and graduated in July 2017 with a Bachelor of Social Sciences, with honours in Social Work.
She says that the scholarshi­p helped to relieve her from financial pressures, and also allowed her opportunit­ies to engage with the staff at SKH, even before she commenced work there.
“These opportunit­ies allowed me to have a better understand­ing of the environmen­t and the people I will be working with,” she says. Healthcare Merit Award CRITERIA: Singapore citizen or permanent resident who is willing to take up Singapore citizenshi­p; achieve outstandin­g A-level results (offered at least 10 academic units), diploma with merit/distinctio­n or equivalent qualificat­ions (e.g. Internatio­nal Baccalaure­ate (IB) or NUS high school diploma); good cocurricul­ar activities record and strong leadership qualities; passion for serving in the public healthcare sector; good communicat­ion skills Healthcare Merit Award recipient Ms Chan Shi Min advocates for individual­s living with HIV/Aids                              W hile some have reservatio­ns about working closely with those who have sexually transmitte­d diseases, medical social worker Chan Shi Min is passionate about providing support and care to such individual­s.
For the past two years, the 26-year-old has been working with those who have the human immunodefi­ciency virus ( HIV ) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (Aids).
“I believe that no one should be discrimina­ted because of their medical condition,” says Ms Chan. “More can be done to educate the public about HIV and Aids, so as to dispel some of the common misconcept­ions and misinforma­tion.”
Many of these patients are initially unwilling to engage with her, she says. “They fear being judged.”
But by demonstrat­ing genuine interest in helping them, they gradually warm up to her and eventually share with her their psychosoci­al concerns and needs.
Ms Chan also assists other vulnerable individual­s. Her work at Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) includes ensuring that her patients are able to transit smoothly from the hospital back to the community, and linking them up with community resources.
“Being a medical social worker involves more than just listening intently to the concerns of our patients and their families,” she says. “It is also about providing them informatio­n so they can make informed decisions, helping them navigate the healthcare system, and advocating for their needs.”
Some of these needs include accommodat­ion, financial assistance with medical bills, and follow-up treatments.
To her, exercising empathy is essential in her work “to better understand patients’ perspectiv­es and situations”. VALUE OF AWARD: Tuition and compulsory fees; monthly allowances; pre-study allowance; return economy airfare and clinical placement expense (for overseas study only); sponsorshi­p for approved developmen­tal programmes; commenceme­nt award; distinctio­n award
(for scholars who graduate with at least Second Class (Upper) Honours or equivalent)                                                               BOND PERIOD: critical, as she sees more patients and families experienci­ng anxiety as a result of facing financial stressors, family conflicts, and job uncertaint­y.
The work does get tiring, but the satisfacti­on of knowing that what she does can make a difference to a patient keeps her going.
While there are many who look to her for help and support, Ms Chan says that she gleans much from them too. “There are patients and their caregivers who never fail to inspire me with their resilience towards life.”
Having worked for three years now, she has this to say about the public healthcare industry: “It is fast-paced, dynamic and exciting. If you have the desire and passion to help others improve their lives, join us.” Four years (local); six years (overseas) Terms and conditions apply.
