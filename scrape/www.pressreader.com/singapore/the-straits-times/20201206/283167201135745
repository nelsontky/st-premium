    <p>Since the on­set of Covid-19, many pa­tients seek­ing help from sports physi­cians have re­vealed that they are run­ning more fre­quently, or faster, or on slopes as they be­came fit­ter over time.</p>
    <p>In their en­thu­si­asm, some com­plained of pain in their knees, shins, heels and feet, forc­ing them to stop tem­po­rar­ily to re­cu­per­ate.</p>
    <p>Train­ing load-re­lated is­sues, in­ad­e­quate re­cov­ery, run­ning ter­rain and footwear can pre­cip­i­tate prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Other fac­tors in­clude poor con­di­tion­ing, ex­ces­sive weight, struc­tural is­sues, soft tis­sue tight­ness, mus­cle im­bal­ances, and run­ning tech­nique.</p>
    <p>With vir­tual events, such as The Straits Times Vir­tual Run’s 175km race, cover­ing long dis­tances, it is im­per­a­tive for par­tic­i­pants to know how to iden­tify – and deal with – com­mon run­ning in­juries.</p>
    <p>KNEE PAIN</p>
    <p>Pain in the front of the knee is usu­ally due to patellofem­oral (kneecap) pain or patella tendinopa­thy. Run­ners typ­i­cally re­port pain that wors­ens af­ter pro­longed run­ning or when squat­ting, jump­ing or climb­ing stairs.</p>
    <p>In older in­di­vid­u­als, when there is also swelling of the knee, there may be un­der­ly­ing os­teoarthri­tis.</p>
    <p>The il­i­otib­ial band is a thick band run­ning down the outer as­pect of the thigh that may rub over the out­side of the knee and cause il­i­otib­ial band fric­tion syn­drome.</p>
    <p>Ham­string in­juries may also oc­cur, es­pe­cially with sprint­ing, man­i­fested by a “pop” or tear­ing sound be­hind the knee ac­com­pa­nied by swelling and some­times bruis­ing.</p>
    <p>SHIN PAIN</p>
    <p>Pain over the front of the shin could have its ori­gin in the mus­cle, ten­don, pe­rios­teum (sheath cover­ing bone) or bone it­self.</p>
    <p>Me­dial tib­ial stress syn­drome typ­i­cally man­i­fests as pain over a long seg­ment of the in­ner shin dur­ing a run and may per­sist for hours to days when the con­di­tion wors­ens.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to dis­tin­guish this from a stress frac­ture (crack in the bone) of the tibia where pain is more lo­calised. Chronic com­part­ment syn­drome is where a run­ner re­ports in­creas­ing pain with “hard­en­ing” of the mus­cle that re­solves upon slow­ing down to rest.</p>
    <p>HEEL PAIN</p>
    <p>The Achilles ten­don can acutely swell up, be­com­ing red, hot and painful, or man­i­fest as a chronic swelling with mild pain that goes away when you are warmed up. Where the ten­don in­serts onto the heel bone, oc­ca­sion­ally a painful bump might ap­pear.</p>
    <p>Plan­tar fasci­itis is an­other com­mon heel con­di­tion that hurts on your first step on the floor in the morn­ing af­ter get­ting up from bed, and di­min­ishes af­ter a few steps or a few min­utes.</p>
    <p>AN­KLE AND FOOT PAIN</p>
    <p>Through repet­i­tive pound­ing and push­ing off, you could de­velop metatarsal­gia which is pain over the fore­foot across the se­cond through the fourth metatarsal heads.</p>
    <p>There are many causes, in­clud­ing toe de­for­mi­ties, ab­nor­mal gait, trauma, bur­si­tis and in­ter­dig­i­tal neu­roma. Stress frac­tures can oc­cur, com­monly at the se­cond and third metatarsal bones.</p>
    <p>Tendinopa­thy of the foot and an­kle is com­mon, es­pe­cially when there is pre­vi­ous foot or an­kle in­jury, pre­sent­ing with pain af­ter pro­longed ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Com­mon ten­dons in­volved in­clude tib­ialis pos­te­rior (in­ner an­kle), per­oneal (outer an­kle) or tib­ialis an­te­rior (front of an­kle).</p>
    <p>WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP OUR­SELVES?</p>
    <p>A large ma­jor­ity of in­juries are re­lated to overuse or in­ad­e­quate re­cov­ery from train­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­gin­ner run­ners should start with a rel­a­tively shorter dis­tance, in­ten­sity and fre­quency, es­pe­cially if they have been seden­tary for a pro­longed pe­riod.</p>
    <p>A good start­ing point is to main­tain a mod­er­ate pace (can talk but not sing; 60-70 per cent max­i­mum heart rate) for 30 min­utes once or twice a week, mix­ing in brisk walk­ing to keep over­all fa­tigue low. Grad­u­ally in­crease this over weeks to months, aim­ing for 150 min­utes a week.</p>
    <p>Footwear is im­por­tant too. Choose a shoe that is com­fort­able, fits well and suits your foot shape and de­mands. Re­place your shoe if it starts to wear out. A good qual­ity run­ning shoe is de­signed to last be­tween 600km and 800km, though it de­pends on fac­tors like run­ning ter­rain and body weight.</p>
    <p>Ex­er­cise on el­lip­ti­cal ma­chines or swim, walk and cy­cle for crosstrain­ing to main­tain fit­ness while work­ing through run­ning-re­lated pains.</p>
    <p>In­cor­po­rate a reg­u­lar stretch­ing rou­tine. In ad­di­tion, strength train­ing has been shown to re­duce the risk of overuse in­juries by up to half, and should i deally be in­cluded two to three times a week.</p>
    <p>Over­all re­cov­ery is also im­por­tant, so aim to eat a healthy bal­anced diet, get ad­e­quate sleep and man­age ex­ter­nal stres­sors.</p>
    <p>WHEN SHOULD WE SEEK MED­I­CAL AT­TEN­TION?</p>
    <p>Mild dis­com­fort may be ex­pe­ri­enced ini­tially when start­ing to run reg­u­larly. This is nor­mal and should not grad­u­ally worsen.</p>
    <p>How­ever, per­sis­tent pain or swelling in spite of rest should not be ig­nored and sig­nals the need to seek med­i­cal ad­vice.</p>
    <p>You may need imag­ing stud­ies such as an X-ray, ul­tra­sound scan or MRI to de­ter­mine the ex­act na­ture of the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Your doc­tor may pre­scribe med­i­ca­tion, re­fer you to a phys­io­ther­a­pist or a po­di­a­trist to have your gait an­a­lysed or be fit­ted with a foot or­tho­sis.</p>
    <p>In­jec­tions, ex­tra­cor­po­real shock­wave ther­apy or surgery may be rec­om­mended where in­di­cated.</p>
