    <p>ORLANDO It was not a sea­son. For the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers, it was an ob­sta­cle course. It was 12 months packed with tragedies and to­geth­er­ness.</p>
    <p>It was un­prece­dented and of­ten un­pleas­ant, an odyssey that be­gan for them in a Chi­nese ho­tel amid a geopo­lit­i­cal feud and ended in a mostly empty arena at Dis­ney World, the site of the world’s most fa­mous bub­ble since the in­ven­tion of chew­ing gum.</p>
    <p>But for all the dis­rup­tive forces that rocked the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA), the Lak­ers tri­umphed in the end.</p>
    <p>They won their 17th cham­pi­onship – and their first with LeBron James as their cen­tre­piece – with a 106-93 vic­tory over the Mi­ami Heat on Sun­day night in Game 6, claim­ing the Fi­nals 4-2.</p>
    <p>There were no spec­ta­tors – one of the hard re­al­i­ties of com­pet­ing for a ti­tle in a pan­demic that forced the NBA to sus­pend its sea­son for more than four months be­fore play re­sumed in late July.</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers, how­ever, went about their busi­ness in iso­la­tion, win­ning it all as fans cheered from home.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t mat­ter where it hap­pens if you win a cham­pi­onship,” James said with a vic­tory cigar in his hand. “A bub­ble, Mi­ami, Golden State – it doesn’t mat­ter. When you get to this point, it’s one of the great­est feel­ings in the world for a bas­ket­ball player to be able to win at the high­est level.”</p>
    <p>No player was more bril­liant than James, who, at 35, was named the Fi­nals Most Valu­able Player for the fourth time in his ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Af­ter making his ninth trip to the fi­nals in the past 10 sea­sons, and his 10th ap­pear­ance over­all, James has now won four cham­pi­onships with three fran­chises.</p>
    <p>He pow­ered Sun­day’s rout – the Lak­ers led by as many as 36 – with 28 points, 14 boards and 10 as­sists.</p>
    <p>For the se­ries, he av­er­aged 29.8</p>
    <p>points, 11.8 re­bounds and 8.5 as­sists while shoot­ing 59 per cent from the field to help his team shrug off the ef­fects of the NBA’s long­est sea­son.</p>
    <p>Last October, a pre-sea­son trip to China turned into an in­ter­na­tional in­ci­dent when Daryl Morey, the Hous­ton Rock­ets’ gen­eral man­ager, tweeted his sup­port for Hong Kong’s pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers, an­ger­ing the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment and re­strict­ing the Lak­ers to their ho­tel for days.</p>
    <p>Then, the unimag­in­able hap­pened on Jan 26 when Lak­ers icon Kobe Bryant and his 13-year-old daugh­ter, Gianna, were among nine peo­ple who died in a he­li­copter crash near Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>The sea­son was later in­def­i­nitely halted due to the pan­demic and as</p>
    <p>the hia­tus dragged on, protests against po­lice bru­tal­ity and racial in­jus­tice roiled the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Yet, through it all – calami­ties, big and small – the Lak­ers re­mained de­ter­mined to chase the fran­chise’s first cham­pi­onship since 2010, which was also Bryant’s last of his five ti­tles.</p>
    <p>Lak­ers for­ward An­thony Davis, who had 19 points and 15 re­bounds on Sun­day, ded­i­cated his first cham­pi­onship to him, say­ing: “Kobe, I know he’s look­ing down on us su­per proud.</p>
    <p>“We miss him... He would come to the game and just tell us, ‘This is y’all year. Go out and take it.’ He had a lot of con­fi­dence in our team, in our or­gan­i­sa­tion to go out there and win it this year.”</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers are not a per­fect team. At a time when out­side shoot­ing has never been more valued, they were medi­ocre from the three-point range, shoot­ing 34.9 per cent dur­ing the reg­u­lar sea­son.</p>
    <p>But in James and Davis, they have two dom­i­nant forces on a ros­ter full of play­ers will­ing to de­fend.</p>
    <p>Af­ter rank­ing third in over­all de­fence dur­ing the reg­u­lar sea­son, the Lak­ers were still able to com­pen­sate for the ab­sence of Avery Bradley, their top perime­ter de­fender, af­ter he opted out of the restart.</p>
    <p>They had failed to reach the play­offs in six straight sea­sons be­fore this year, but the ball started to roll af­ter James ar­rived on a four-year con­tract in the sum­mer of 2018.</p>
    <p>There was still to be more up­heaval – the Lak­ers had to par­lay some young tal­ent and a num­ber of future draft picks to ac­quire Davis a year later.</p>
    <p>They also had to deal with the fir­ing of pre­vi­ous coach Luke Wal­ton and the de­par­ture of pres­i­dent of bas­ket­ball op­er­a­tions Magic John­son over “back­stab­bing” claims.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Davis, the in­flu­ence of first-year coach Frank Vo­gel, who “got on us Day 1 about de­fence”, and a fired-up James, irked by ques­tions over his dura­bil­ity – he had missed 27 games the pre­vi­ous sea­son due to in­jury – got them over the line.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, James left on top. Af­ter a sea­son full of tu­mult and change, at least that much was fa­mil­iar.</p>
