    <p>LON­DON • HSBC Hold­ings warned its bad debt charges could blow past a pre­vi­ous es­ti­mate to US$13 bil­lion (S$17.9 bil­lion) this year and said its prof­its tum­bled 65 per cent, as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic ham­mered its re­tail and cor­po­rate cus­tomers world­wide.</p>
    <p>The re­sults from Europe’s big­gest bank by as­sets yes­ter­day re­in­forced the trend of lenders world­wide in­flat­ing their buf­fers to ab­sorb sour­ing loans at a time when firms are reel­ing from the im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>HSBC re­ported a pre-tax profit of US$4.32 bil­lion for the first six months this year, lower than the US$5.67 bil­lion av­er­age of an­a­lysts’ fore­casts.</p>
    <p>The bank in­creased its es­ti­mate of the to­tal bad debt charges it could take this year to be­tween US$8 bil­lion and US$13 bil­lion from US$7 bil­lion to US$11 bil­lion, re­flect­ing worse-than-ex­pected ac­tual losses in the se­cond quar­ter and ex­pec­ta­tions of a steeper eco­nomic de­cline.</p>
    <p>“What we have seen this quar­ter is quite a sharp shift in eco­nomic out­look for the global econ­omy, the fa­mous V has got a lot sharper and as a re­sult we have ma­te­ri­ally in­creased our pro­vi­sions,” chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Ewen Steven­son told Reuters.</p>
    <p>HSBC’s busi­ness in Bri­tain has been hit par­tic­u­larly hard, Mr Steven­son said, as it took a US$1.5 bil­lion charge against ex­pected credit losses.</p>
    <p>While the bank’s re­sults were bol­stered like those of its US and Euro­pean peers by higher rev­enues from fixed in­come trad­ing, an­a­lysts said in­vestors were likely to be dis­ap­pointed by the fore­cast of higher bad debt charges.</p>
    <p>Its Hong Kong-listed shares dropped as much as 4.7 per cent yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, out­pac­ing a fall in the lo­cal bench­mark, to their low­est since March 2009.</p>
    <p>Its rev­enues fell 9 per cent in the six-month pe­riod, as global in­ter­est rate cuts and de­clin­ing mar­ket val­ues on as­sets in in­vest­ment bank­ing and in­sur­ance out­weighed higher trad­ing in­come.</p>
    <p>HSBC is con­tin­u­ing to re­view its long-term div­i­dend pol­icy, chief ex­ec­u­tive Noel Quinn said in a state­ment. The bank ear­lier this year halted pay­outs in re­sponse to a reg­u­la­tory re­quest in Bri­tain, in­fu­ri­at­ing many of its re­tail in­vestors, par­tic­u­larly those in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mr Quinn told Reuters the bank’s staff head­count has fallen by some 4,000 this year af­ter it restarted a re­dun­dancy pro­gramme that was put on ice fol­low­ing the coro­n­avirus outbreak.</p>
    <p>The bank is aim­ing to cut costs by 3 per cent this year from that re­struc­tur­ing as well as lower em­ployee spend­ing on travel and other items dur­ing the pan­demic, he said.</p>
    <p>Only a fifth of the around 9,000 staff in its head­quar­ters in Lon­don’s Ca­nary Wharf district would be able to re­turn to work in the near term for safety rea­sons, Mr Quinn told Reuters.</p>
