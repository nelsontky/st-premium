    <p>Aus­tralian De­fence Min­is­ter Linda Reynolds met her Sin­ga­pore coun­ter­part Ng Eng Hen yes­ter­day and reaf­firmed the close and long­stand­ing de­fence re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>They met at Min­def head­quar­ters where they dis­cussed re­gional and in­ter­na­tional se­cu­rity de­vel­op­ments, in­clud­ing the im­por­tance of en­hanc­ing re­gional counter-ter­ror­ism co­op­er­a­tion, said a Min­istry of De­fence state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It added that Ms Reynolds’ visit was a key mile­stone in the lead-up to the com­mem­o­ra­tion of the 30th an­niver­sary of the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces’ (SAF) train­ing in the Shoal­wa­ter Bay Train­ing Area in Queens­land, Aus­tralia. This is sched­uled to take place later this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Reynolds also called on Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong at the Is­tana and Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat dur­ing her one­day in­tro­duc­tory visit to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post af­ter their meet­ing, PM Lee said he had a good dis­cus­sion with Ms Reynolds on re­gional and in­ter­na­tional se­cu­rity chal­lenges, and how to ad­dress them to­gether.</p>
    <p>Ms Reynolds and Dr Ng reaf­firmed the deep­en­ing de­fence co­op­er­a­tion un­der the Sin­ga­pore-Aus­tralia Com­pre­hen­sive Strate­gic Part­ner­ship, and wel­comed the steady progress made in the joint devel­op­ment of train­ing ar­eas and ad­vanced train­ing fa­cil­i­ties in Queens­land, said Min­def.</p>
    <p>The joint devel­op­ment is made un­der the treaty-level Agree­ment Con­cern­ing Mil­i­tary Train­ing and Train­ing Area Devel­op­ment in Aus­tralia, which both min­is­ters signed in March this year.</p>
    <p>The two lead­ers also reaf­firmed the value of key se­cu­rity plat­forms such as the Asean De­fence Min­is­ters’ Meet­ing-Plus and the Five Power De­fence Ar­range­ments in ad­dress­ing se­cu­rity chal­lenges, and agreed to con­tinue the strong co­op­er­a­tion via th­ese plat­forms.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Dr Ng wrote that Aus­tralia is one of Sin­ga­pore’s clos­est de­fence part­ners.</p>
    <p>“It’s no won­der that each time we meet, our dis­cus­sions are rich and pro­duc­tive on a wide range of se­cu­rity chal­lenges, and there is a meet­ing of minds in our ap­proach to re­gional peace and sta­bil­ity,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian min­is­ter is on a trip to Asia which in­cludes vis­its to Ja­pan, Brunei and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last week, she wrote that on the agenda for her Sin­ga­pore visit was re­view­ing the two coun­tries’ sub­stan­tial de­fence en­gage­ment, which has con­tin­ued dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“My visit will pro­vide an im­por­tant op­por­tu­nity to mark the 30th an­niver­sary of Sin­ga­pore’s mil­i­tary train­ing in Aus­tralia,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>She also vis­ited Sem­bawang Air Base yes­ter­day for a fa­mil­iari­sa­tion flight in a Repub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force Su­per Puma he­li­copter.</p>
    <p>Health checks and safety mea­sures were taken by the vis­it­ing del­e­ga­tion, said Min­def.</p>
    <p>The SAF and the Aus­tralian De­fence Force have a long his­tory of mil­i­tary co­op­er­a­tion, with ex­ten­sive in­ter­ac­tions such as bi­lat­eral and mul­ti­lat­eral train­ing ex­er­cises and pro­fes­sional ex­changes, it added.</p>
