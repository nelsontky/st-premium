    <p>WASHINGTON/LON­DON • The US and Bri­tain have con­demned what they said were a litany of ma­li­cious cy­ber at­tacks orches­trated by Rus­sian mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence, in­clud­ing ef­forts to dis­rupt the Olympic and Par­a­lympic Games in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials from both coun­tries said the cy­ber at­tacks were car­ried out by Unit 74455 of Rus­sia’s GRU mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence agency, also known as the Main Cen­tre for Spe­cial Tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>In an in­dict­ment un­sealed on Mon­day, the US Jus­tice Depart­ment said six mem­bers of the unit had played key roles in at­tacks on tar­gets rang­ing from the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for the Pro­hi­bi­tion of Chem­i­cal Weapons to the 2017 French polls.</p>
    <p>The charges cov­ered four years of ma­li­cious cy­ber ac­tiv­ity – from 2015 to last year.</p>
    <p>US of­fi­cials would not say whether the an­nounce­ment’s tim­ing, just ahead of the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, was in­tended to serve as a warn­ing to for­eign, gov­ern­ment-linked hack­ing groups.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said the sus­pects were from the same unit that helped dis­trib­ute stolen Demo­cratic e-mails in the 2016 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tors fo­cused on seven breaches that showed how Rus­sia sought in re­cent years to use its hack­ing abil­i­ties to un­der­mine demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions and ideals, re­tal­i­ate against en­e­mies and de­stroy ri­val economies.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber-se­cu­rity and na­tional-se­cu­rity ex­perts had long ar­gued that the Rus­sians were be­hind the hacks that pros­e­cu­tors de­tailed on Mon­day. But the in­dict­ment was the first time a ma­jor law en­force­ment agency made the charge, bol­ster­ing the hack­ing unit’s no­to­ri­ety as one of the most au­da­cious in the world.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish of­fi­cials, mean­while, said the GRU hack­ers had also con­ducted “cy­ber re­con­nais­sance” op­er­a­tions against or­gan­is­ers of the Tokyo Games, which were orig­i­nally sched­uled to be held this year but post­poned be­cause of the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish of­fi­cials de­clined to give spe­cific de­tails about the lat­est at­tacks or say whether they were suc­cess­ful, but said they had tar­geted Games or­gan­is­ers, lo­gis­tics sup­pli­ers and spon­sors.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a vir­tual press con­fer­ence on Mon­day, US Jus­tice Depart­ment As­sis­tant At­tor­ney-Gen­eral John De­mers also de­clined to dis­cuss the hack­ing ac­tiv­ity around the 2020 Games.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab said: “The GRU’s ac­tions against the Olympic and Par­a­lympic Games are cyn­i­cal and reck­less. We con­demn them in the strong­est pos­si­ble terms.”</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion deputy direc­tor David Bowdich said: “The FBI has re­peat­edly warned that Rus­sia is a highly ca­pa­ble cy­ber ad­ver­sary, and the in­for­ma­tion re­vealed in this in­dict­ment il­lus­trates how per­va­sive and de­struc­tive Rus­sia’s cy­ber ac­tiv­i­ties truly are.”</p>
    <p>Mr De­mers said: “No coun­try has weaponised its cy­ber ca­pa­bil­i­ties as ma­li­ciously or ir­re­spon­si­bly as Rus­sia, wan­tonly caus­ing un­prece­dented dam­age to pur­sue small tac­ti­cal ad­van­tages and to sat­isfy fits of spite.”</p>
    <p>The Rus­sian Em­bassy in Washington on Mon­day strongly de­nied the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“It is ab­so­lutely ob­vi­ous that such news breaks have no bear­ing on re­al­ity and are aimed at whip­ping up Rus­so­pho­bic sen­ti­ments in Amer­i­can so­ci­ety, at launch­ing a ‘witch hunt’ and spy ma­nia, which have been a dis­tinc­tive fea­ture of the po­lit­i­cal life in Washington for sev­eral years,” the em­bassy’s press of­fice said in a writ­ten state­ment.</p>
    <p>The at­tacks on the 2020 Games are the lat­est in a string of hack­ing at­tempts against in­ter­na­tional sport­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions that West­ern of­fi­cials and cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­perts say have been orches­trated by Rus­sia since its dop­ing scan­dal erupted five years ago. Mos­cow has re­peat­edly de­nied the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain and the United States also said on Mon­day that the hack­ers were in­volved in other at­tacks, such as the hack of the 2018 Win­ter Olympics open­ing cer­e­mony in South Korea, which com­pro­mised hun­dreds of com­put­ers, took down In­ter­net ac­cess and dis­rupted broad­cast feeds.</p>
    <p>The at­tack in South Korea had pre­vi­ously been linked to Rus­sia by cy­ber-se­cu­rity re­searchers, but was made to look like the work of Chi­nese or North Korean hack­ers, Bri­tain’s For­eign Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>“The at­tacks on the 2020 Sum­mer Games are the lat­est in a cam­paign of Rus­sian ma­li­cious ac­tiv­ity against the Olympic and Par­a­lympic Games,” it said.</p>
    <p>“The UK is con­firm­ing for the first time today the ex­tent of GRU tar­get­ing of the 2018 Win­ter Olympic and Par­a­lympic Games in Pyeongchan­g, Repub­lic of Korea.”</p>
    <p>Among the op­er­a­tions that the Jus­tice Depart­ment cited was the re­lease of stolen doc­u­ments just as vot­ing was be­gin­ning in France’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in 2017, in an ap­par­ent at­tempt to hurt Mr Em­manuel Macron in his even­tual vic­tory against Ms Ma­rine Le Pen, a far-right can­di­date sup­ported by Mos­cow.</p>
    <p>Other cy­ber op­er­a­tions al­legedly con­ducted by the GRU of­fi­cers since 2015, ac­cord­ing to the Jus­tice Depart­ment, in­cluded the global cy­ber at­tack known as NotPetya.</p>
    <p>It was orig­i­nally aimed at Ukraine but quickly boomerange­d around the world, paralysing some of the big­gest cor­po­ra­tions in Europe and the US at an es­ti­mated to­tal cost of US$10 bil­lion (S$13.6 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The new charges did not ad­dress in­ter­fer­ence in the US elec­tion next month. Amer­i­can in­tel­li­gence agen­cies have as­sessed that Rus­sia is try­ing to in­flu­ence the vote on Nov 3.</p>
