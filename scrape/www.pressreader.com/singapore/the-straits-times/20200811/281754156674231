    <p>SEOUL • The Red Cross has trained 43,000 North Korean vol­un­teers to help com­mu­ni­ties, in­clud­ing the locked-down city of Kaesong, fight the coro­n­avirus and pro­vide flood as­sis­tance, an of­fi­cial with the re­lief or­gan­i­sa­tion said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un de­clared an emer­gency last month and im­posed a lock­down on Kaesong, near the in­ter-Korean bor­der, af­ter a man who de­fected to the South in 2017 re­turned to the city show­ing Covid-19 symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Heavy rain and flood­ing in re­cent days have also sparked con­cern about crop dam­age and food sup­plies in the iso­lated coun­try.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Red Cross and Red Cres­cent So­ci­eties (IFRC) has built an ex­ten­sive net­work of North Korean vol­un­teers to help res­i­dents in all nine prov­inces to avoid the virus and re­duce dam­age from floods and land­slides, spokesman Antony Bal­main said.</p>
    <p>“Hun­dreds of homes have been dam­aged and large ar­eas of rice fields have been sub­merged due to heavy rain and some flash flood­ing,” Mr Bal­main said.</p>
    <p>Pre­cip­i­ta­tion lev­els in the North this month were higher than in 2007, when the coun­try suf­fered its worst floods, said a spokesman for South Korea’s Uni­fi­ca­tion Min­istry over­see­ing in­ter-Korean af­fairs.</p>
    <p>In Kaesong, which was grap­pling with both the lock­down and floods, IFRC vol­un­teers were pro­vid­ing 2,100 fam­i­lies most at risk with re­lief items, in­clud­ing tar­pau­lins, kitchen sets, quilts, hy­giene kits and wa­ter con­tain­ers, Mr Bal­main said.</p>
    <p>“Fam­i­lies are be­ing sup­ported with psy­cho­log­i­cal first aid and aware­ness ac­tiv­i­ties to main­tain hy­giene and stay healthy,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim has also sent spe­cial aid pack­ages to Kaesong, and state me­dia re­ported yes­ter­day that grain sup­plies from Py­ongyang had ar­rived in an­other flood-rav­aged county that he vis­ited last week.</p>
    <p>North Korea has not con­firmed any Covid-19 cases, but the coun­try has en­forced strict quar­an­tine mea­sures.</p>
    <p>South Korea has said there is no ev­i­dence the re­turn­ing de­fec­tor was in­fected.</p>
    <p>The IFRC last month pro­vided North Korea with kits de­signed to run up to 10,000 coro­n­avirus tests, along­side in­frared ther­mome­ters, sur­gi­cal masks and gowns, and pro­tec­tive gear.</p>
