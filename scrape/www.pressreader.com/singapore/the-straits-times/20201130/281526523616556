    <p>Bri­tain is set to ap­prove the Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by BioNTech and Pfizer this week and de­liv­er­ies would likely be­gin within hours of the au­tho­ri­sa­tion. The first im­mu­ni­sa­tions could take place from Dec 7, the Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain is set to ap­prove the Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by BioNTech and Pfizer this week and de­liv­er­ies would be­gin within hours of the au­tho­ri­sa­tion, the Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported.</p>
    <p>The first im­mu­ni­sa­tions us­ing the BioNTech and Pfizer vac­cine could take place from Dec 7, the FT said, cit­ing un­named sources.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain said on Nov 20 it had for­mally asked its med­i­cal reg­u­la­tor, the Medicines and Health­care Prod­ucts Reg­u­la­tory Agency, to as­sess the vac­cine for its suit­abil­ity, the first step in mak­ing it avail­able out­side the United States.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has or­dered 40 mil­lion doses of the vac­cine, which has been found to be 95 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment also asked the reg­u­la­tor last Fri­day to as­sess As­traZeneca’s Covid-19 vac­cine for a pos­si­ble roll-out.</p>
    <p>The US health au­thor­i­ties will also hold an emer­gency meet­ing this week to rec­om­mend that the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine await­ing ap­proval be given first to health­care work­ers and peo­ple in long-term care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing, an­nounced last Fri­day by a US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion com­mit­tee on im­mu­ni­sa­tions, sug­gests the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion might be close to au­tho­ris­ing dis­tri­bu­tion of the med­i­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>United Air­lines has be­gun mov­ing ship­ments of the vac­cine on char­ter flights to en­sure it can be quickly dis­trib­uted once it is ap­proved, ac­cord­ing to a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries have al­ready launched lim­ited vac­ci­na­tion cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s mil­i­tary aims to i noc­u­late more than 400,000 ser­vice­men, De­fence Min­is­ter Sergei Shoigu said, adding that more than 2,500 sol­diers had al­ready been vac­ci­nated and that by the end of the year, the num­ber was ex­pected to reach 80,000.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia last week said that its Sput­nik V coro­n­avirus vac­cine was 95 per cent ef­fec­tive, ac­cord­ing to pre­lim­i­nary data.</p>
    <p>Sput­nik V’s de­vel­op­ers have touted it as eas­ier to store than some al­ter­na­tives and at less than US$10 (S$13.40) per dose, the cheapest among front run­ners in a global race to de­velop a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The Sput­nik V vac­cine was reg­is­tered in Au­gust and is cur­rently un­der­go­ing its third and fi­nal stage of tri­als in­volv­ing more than 40,000 vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>While hopes are grow­ing that a num­ber of vac­cines will soon be ap­proved, the virus is still spread­ing rapidly, forc­ing na­tional and lo­cal gov­ern­ments to en­force tough mea­sures to try to curb in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>A surge in coro­n­avirus cases will put San Fran­cisco un­der a cur­few be­gin­ning to­day and trig­ger other re­stric­tions re­lated to the virus, the city an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The cur­few re­quires non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses to close and pro­hibits mem­bers of dif­fer­ent house­holds from gath­er­ing be­tween 10pm and 5am un­til Dec 21, Mayor Lon­don Breed said.</p>
    <p>De­spite the risks, the virus, which has in­fected more than 62 mil­lion peo­ple world­wide, has not de­terred sport in some coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In China, around 9,000 run­ners – some wear­ing face masks – took part in the Shang­hai In­ter­na­tional Marathon yes­ter­day, Chi­nese me­dia said.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, which has recorded more than nine mil­lion cases, some of the world’s lead­ing long-dis­tance run­ners par­tic­i­pated in a half-marathon in New Delhi yes­ter­day, even as the coun­try’s cap­i­tal grap­pled with a surge in Covid-19 cases and air pol­lu­tion that has re­cently been among the world’s worst.</p>
