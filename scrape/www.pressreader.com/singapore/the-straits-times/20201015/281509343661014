    <p>The phased reopening of Sin­ga­pore’s bor­der with Malaysia brought some wel­come re­lief for land­lords last month.</p>
    <p>Rents and leas­ings for both Hous­ing Board (HDB) flats and con­do­minium units rose af­ter Au­gust’s rental vol­umes hit their low­est point in 12 months, ac­cord­ing to flash data yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There was such strong de­mand for HDB rentals in ar­eas near in­dus­trial estates in Wood­lands, Ad­mi­ralty, Jurong West, Choa Chu Kang and Sem­bawang that some flats were snapped up within a day, said Mr Henry Lim, as­so­ciate divi­sion direc­tor with PropNex Realty.</p>
    <p>He added that he has about 40 Malaysian work­ers still look­ing for rental flats in Wood­lands and Sem­bawang.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cally, four- or five-bed­room HDB flats are pre­ferred as they can ac­com­mo­date up to six peo­ple each, said ERA Realty re­search and con­sul­tancy head Ni­cholas Mak.</p>
    <p>The Prop­erty Guru web­site shows four such flats avail­able in hot spots like Wood­lands.</p>
    <p>The flash data from real es­tate por­tal SRX Prop­erty out yes­ter­day also showed that HDB rental vol­umes surged 49.7 per cent from Au­gust to last month, when an es­ti­mated 1,611 units were leased.</p>
    <p>Condo rentals rock­eted as well, up from 2,852 units in Au­gust to an es­ti­mated 4,252 last month, a rise of 49.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of Malaysians – from fac­tory work­ers and sales­men to elec­tri­cians and car­pen­ters – have crossed the Cause­way for work since Sin­ga­pore re­opened the bor­der for es­sen­tial travel on Aug 17.</p>
    <p>Many of them were among some 100,000 Malaysians who com­muted daily to Sin­ga­pore for work be­fore the pan­demic, and had re­turned un­der the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment scheme.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple en­ter­ing un­der this scheme must stay in their coun­try of em­ploy­ment for at least 90 days be­fore they can re­turn on home leave.</p>
    <p>“Many Malaysians want shorter leases of six months, but most land­lords look for a min­i­mum one-year lease,” said Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie, noted a grow­ing num­ber of ten­ants opt­ing for shorter leases, while em­ploy­ers in the non-con­struc­tion sec­tors have been re­lo­cat­ing their work­ers from dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>“As leases are now shorter, there will be more trans­ac­tions recorded over time,” said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she does not ex­pect a quick re­bound of the rental mar­ket, given the weak em­ploy­ment cli­mate and travel re­stric­tions. “The leas­ing mar­ket may re­main soft, with some rental price weak­ness in the com­ing months.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mak said the strong de­mand from Malaysian work­ers could be off­set by weaker de­mand from white-col­lar work­ers and stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“Some f or­eign work­ers have been re­trenched due to the eco­nomic weak­ness. Fur­ther­more, Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions have pre­vented some for­eign stu­dents from com­ing to Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>He noted that the in­crease in leas­ing vol­umes has also nudged up rents for HDB flats by about 0.4 per cent, while those for pri­vate con­dos are ahead by 0.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>How­ever, HDB rents were still 14.2 per cent be­low their peak in Au­gust 2013, while rents for con­dos were 17.1 per cent lower than their peak in Jan­uary 2013.</p>
    <p>Rental vol­umes for HDB flats were still down by 20.7 per cent year on year last month and 10.6 per cent lower than the five-year av­er­age vol­ume for the month.</p>
    <p>Leas­ings for con­dos and pri­vate apart­ments were 8 per cent lower than in Septem­ber last year, but 3.2 per cent higher than the five-year av­er­age vol­ume for the month.</p>
    <p>Some for­eign work­ers have been re­trenched due to the eco­nomic weak­ness. Fur­ther­more, Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions have pre­vented some for­eign stu­dents from com­ing to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>MR NI­CHOLAS MAK, ERA Realty re­search and con­sul­tancy head, who says the strong de­mand from Malaysian work­ers could be off­set by weaker de­mand from white-col­lar work­ers and stu­dents.</p>
