    <p>• About three decades ago, Ms Dolly Ng in­her­ited more than RM4 mil­lion (S$1.3 mil­lion) from her par­ents.</p>
    <p>The 72-year-old for­mer pi­ano teacher had been keep­ing the money in sev­eral bank ac­counts through­out the years.</p>
    <p>Some time in May last year, a per­son claim­ing to be a po­lice­man con­tacted her.</p>
    <p>“The caller told me that my money in the ac­counts was un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the au­thor­i­ties,” Ms Ng said. “He ad­vised me to open a new ac­count and trans­fer the en­tire amount there.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ng said she fol­lowed the in­struc­tions and trans­ferred RM4.3 mil­lion into the new ac­count.</p>
    <p>“About two months later, a friend told me about some scams dur­ing a ca­sual con­ver­sa­tion. I got wor­ried and de­cided to go to the bank to check on my sav­ings.”</p>
    <p>To her shock, she found that there was just RM14,000 left in her ac­count. “I quickly with­drew the re­main­ing money,” Ms Ng said, adding that she then lodged a po­lice re­port.</p>
    <p>The printed state­ments she ob­tained from the bank showed that the money in her ac­count was trans­ferred out via In­ter­net bank­ing to 18 in­di­vid­ual ac­counts over a pe­riod of 45 days.</p>
    <p>“I did not open any In­ter­net bank­ing fa­cil­ity un­der the ac­count.</p>
    <p>“So how can the bank al­low the trans­ac­tions with­out any ver­i­fi­ca­tion from me?”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the state­ments, some of the names were of peo­ple who were not known to her.</p>
    <p>A trans­ac­tion of RM9,999 was made 15 times a day, which to­talled up to 459 trans­ac­tions from June 1 to July 16 last year.</p>
    <p>“I am a re­tiree,” Ms Ng said.</p>
    <p>“The money was my only safety net. I have no other in­come to last through my old age.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ng has since ini­ti­ated le­gal ac­tion against the bank, seek­ing com­pen­sa­tion for the money she lost.</p>
    <p>“The bank lost my money. It is only right that they give it back to me.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ng’s lawyer Loo Chay Meng said the case has been filed at the Shah Alam High Court. The hear­ing is sched­uled for Nov 23 and 24.</p>
    <p>ONLY SAFETY NET</p>
    <p>The money was my only safety net. I have no other in­come to last through my old age.</p>
