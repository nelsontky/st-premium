    <p>If there is one thing cer­tain, it is that $1 mil­lion Kranji Mile win­ner Aramaayo has im­proved for his se­cond straight Group 1 bid to­day – the $500,000 Sin­ga­pore Derby.</p>
    <p>His trainer, Shane Baertschig­er, was im­pressed with his Aramco Sta­ble-owned Aus­tralian-bred’s fi­nal gal­lop on Tues­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t be hap­pier with his gal­lop. Matthew Kel­lady rode him and they went great,” he said.</p>
    <p>I was cap­ti­vated by the 600m hitout, too. Ac­com­pa­nied by sta­ble­mate No Re­grets, the sparkling geld­ing gal­loped with plenty of en­thu­si­asm and pulled up look­ing like a mil­lion bucks.</p>
    <p>With his horse ooz­ing with form, I share Baertschig­er’s sen­ti­ments that he can achieve his first Derby suc­cess with the horse specif­i­cally bought for the race, which was resched­uled from April 18 due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­deed, his horse has thrived and has a nice in­side bar­rier to give him the per­fect run.</p>
    <p>His jockey, Ruan Maia, is rid­ing on the crest of a wave. The Kranji Mile-win­ning rider’s seven-timer two weeks ago is tes­ti­mony.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, to­day’s field does not look as strong as the Kranji Mi l e , so no-one can blame Baertschig­er for hav­ing high hopes of win­ning the race that has eluded him and his fa­ther, Don.</p>
    <p>“Aramaayo is by far my best chance to win a Derby. He was bought for the race,” said the lanky Aus­tralian trainer, whose best re­sult was a fifth with Pred­i­tor in 2017. “I know we have a gen­uine Derby horse on our hands. His win in the Kranji Mile proved it.”</p>
    <p>In the Mile, Maia rode Aramaayo a treat. The Brazil­ian guided his mount up beau­ti­fully from mid­field and was al­ready within strik­ing dis­tance of the lead­ers at the top of the straight.</p>
    <p>He then mas­ter­fully steered his horse to the line, hold­ing off the Michael Cle­ments-trained Top Knight by half a length.</p>
    <p>I reckon Aramaayo and Top Knight are the ones to beat again in the Derby. Both horses have class writ­ten all over them.</p>
    <p>The 1,800m Derby trip will not bother Aramaayo.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, he has con­tested the Group 1 Vic­to­ria Derby over 2,500m in 2018 and the Group 1 Aus­tralian Derby over 2,400m last year, al­beit un­placed in both.</p>
    <p>The ex­tra 200m will also suit Top Knight on the way he cut back the deficit on Aramaayo in the Kranji Mile. But the for­mer Cham­pion Three-Year-Old is a bit dis­ad­van­taged by bar­rier 13, the sec­ond­widest draw.</p>
    <p>He will need to burn some petrol to cross in for a good spot.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Aramaayo can se­cure a more eco­nom­i­cal run and be well up from Gate 3. He will draw first blood at the top of the straight.</p>
    <p>If he gets a nice break­away, three-time Sin­ga­pore cham­pion jockey Vlad Duric will need to work harder to get Top Knight to deny Baertschig­er his much-an­tic­i­pated first Derby suc­cess.</p>
    <p>The good thing for Top Knight is the long course. He has more time to un­wind. Af­ter fin­ish­ing se­cond in five of his last six starts, in­clud­ing be­hind Aramaayo on an­other oc­ca­sion, the seven-time win­ner richly de­serves to break through.</p>
    <p>Top Knight’s sta­ble­mate Siam Blue Vanda, who came from near last to fin­ish a four-length sixth in the Kranji Mile, could play the spoiler’s role.</p>
    <p>His storm­ing Group 2 Stew­ards’ Cup tri­umph over 1,600m puts him in with a sport­ing chance.</p>
    <p>Trainer Lee Freed­man’s Min­is­ter and trainer Ri­cardo le Grange’s Churchill are the dark horses ca­pa­ble of up­set­ting the ap­ple cart.</p>
    <p>Hat-trick win­ner Min­is­ter is im­prov­ing with ev­ery run. There is no telling how good he is. His set­back is the widest gate.</p>
    <p>Two-time win­ner Churchill is on the rise. From bar­rier 4, top lo­cal jockey Benny Wood­worth can se­cure a good po­si­tion to give his mount ev­ery chance.</p>
    <p>Can he spring a sur­prise? Stay tuned for Sin­ga­pore’s time-hon­oured race; start­ing time 5.30pm.</p>
