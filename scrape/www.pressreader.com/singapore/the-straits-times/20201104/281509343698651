    <p>China suspended Ant Group’s US$37 bil­lion (S$50.4 bil­lion) stock mar­ket list­ing yes­ter­day, thwart­ing the world’s largest ini­tial public of­fer­ing, with days to go.</p>
    <p>Hangzhou-based Ant Group, a 2010 off­shoot of Chi­nese giant Alibaba Group Hold­ing, dominates China’s pay­ments mar­ket via the Ali­pay app.</p>
    <p>It also runs the giant Yu’ebao money mar­ket fund and two of the coun­try’s largest con­sumer lend­ing plat­forms. Other busi­nesses in­clude a credit scor­ing unit and an in­sur­ance mar­ket­place.</p>
    <p>Ali­pay, for one, is the world’s largest dig­i­tal pay­ment plat­form with 711 mil­lion ac­tive users, mostly in China, who tap it to buy ev­ery­thing from a quick cof­fee to even prop­erty.</p>
    <p>It was cre­ated in 2004 as an es­crow ser­vice for Alibaba to se­cure trans­ac­tions on the e-com­merce site and gen­er­ated a whop­ping US$17 tril­lion (US$23.1 tril­lion) in pay­ments in the 12 months through June.</p>
    <p>For those who do not have ready cash, Ant op­er­ates ser­vices that dole out small un­se­cured loans: Huabei and Jiebei. The for­mer fo­cuses on quick con­sumer loans for pur­chases of iPhones and fridges, while the lat­ter fi­nances any­thing from travel to ed­u­ca­tion. The plat­forms made loans to about 500 mil­lion peo­ple in the 12 months through June.</p>
    <p>The Yu’ebao money mar­ket fund, on the other hand, is one of the largest of its kind in the world with about US$173 bil­lion in as­sets.</p>
    <p>Cre­ated in 2013, it al­lowed peo­ple to earn in­ter­est from cash they parked in the app, in­vest­ing as lit­tle as one yuan.</p>
    <p>Ant started a credit scor­ing ser­vice in 2015 called Zhima Credit. If users opt-in to the ser­vice, Ant runs checks for credit wor­thi­ness. It charges firms that tap into the ser­vice a fee and if cus­tomers score high enough, they can avoid pay­ing de­posits such as for bike rental.</p>
    <p>Last year, Ant en­tered the in­sur­ance mar­ket with a healthcare prod­uct called Xianghu-bao that al­lows peo­ple to pay a small monthly fee that is pooled to help cover treat­ment costs for mem­bers stricken by dis­eases such as can­cer, Alzheimer’s and even Ebola.</p>
