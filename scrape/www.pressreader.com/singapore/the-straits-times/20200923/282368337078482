    <p>Gareth Bale’s de­sire to play for the “club of his heart” could speed up his re­cov­ery from a knee injury, Tot­ten­ham man­ager Jose Mour­inho said Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Spurs ini­tially in­di­cated that Bale, who re­joined the club last week from Real Madrid on a sea­son-long loan, was un­likely to be match fit un­til af­ter next month’s in­ter­na­tional break.</p>
    <p>That would put him in line to make his sec­ond Spurs de­but at home to West Ham on Oct 17 – 13 years af­ter mak­ing his first ap­pear­ance at Old Traf­ford against Manch­ester United in Au­gust 2007.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho did not put a timescale on when the Wales for­ward will fea­ture, but he hinted Bale’s de­sire to pull the Spurs shirt on for the first time since 2013 will has­ten his re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know when Gareth can be back,” said the Por­tuguese, whose side beat Southamp­ton 5-2 in the Premier League on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“The only thing I know is that his mo­ti­va­tion is high.</p>
    <p>“He’s so happy to be with the club of his heart, he’s so happy to play for us.</p>
    <p>“And when a player has this mo­ti­va­tion, many times you can shorten the pe­riod of re­cov­ery, you can shorten the pe­riod of getting fit and ready to play.</p>
    <p>“We want to help him so when he’s avail­able to train with the team, we’re more than happy to have him and help him back to a level that made him one of the best play­ers in the world.”</p>
    <p>When he does make his sec­ond de­but, Bale and the Spurs fans will be hop­ing it goes bet­ter than his first, which ended in a 1-0 de­feat.</p>
    <p>It took two years and one month, 25 games and 1,606 min­utes of ac­tion be­fore Bale first tasted vic­tory in the Premier League.</p>
    <p>But Spain left-back Ser­gio Reguilon, who moved to Tot­ten­ham from Real Madrid in a sep­a­rate deal on Satur­day, could launch his new stint at home against New­cas­tle on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Spurs’ League Cup third-round match against Ley­ton Ori­ent was post­poned yes­ter­day af­ter 18 play­ers and staff from the League Two side tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ori­ent con­firmed on Mon­day that some of their play­ers had tested pos­i­tive and that its Breyer Group Sta­dium and train­ing ground fa­cil­i­ties would be closed un­til fur­ther no­tice.</p>
    <p>The English Foot­ball League, which man­ages the three tiers of English foot­ball be­low the top flight Premier League, are not car­ry­ing out weekly test­ing, with many Premier League clubs in­stead foot­ing the bill ahead of cup clashes with lower-league op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ing body said it was wait­ing for the out­come of dis­cus­sions be­tween the club and Pub­lic Health Eng­land be­fore tak­ing any ac­tion.</p>
