    <p>Get­ting scolded by a stranger for pick­ing up or­anges from a road­side of­fer­ing at the start of the sev­enth lu­nar month did not de­ter Mr Daniel Tay from col­lect­ing more fruit left be­hind by wor­ship­pers.</p>
    <p>The 41-year-old re­tired fi­nan­cial ad­viser even or­gan­ised an out­ing on Sept 2 – the 15th day of the sev­enth month – with three friends to col­lect fruit in Bis­han and Ang Mo Kio.</p>
    <p>Over four hours, they got a bounty of 80 or­anges and other fruit such as ap­ples, rambu­tans, lon­gans and pineap­ples.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay and his friends are free­gans – from the words “free” and “ve­g­ans” – peo­ple who re­ject con­sumerism and seek to re­duce waste, es­pe­cially by re­triev­ing and reusing dis­carded items.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay, who started Face­book group Free­gan In Sin­ga­pore in 2017, says he col­lects food of­fer­ings to re­duce food waste.</p>
    <p>The fol­low­ing night, he went around Bis­han again with an­other friend and picked up 122 or­anges.</p>
    <p>He says: “My fam­ily and I have been eat­ing or­anges since last week. When we get tired of eat­ing them, we will juice them.”</p>
    <p>To en­sure he was not of­fend­ing the spir­its – or the liv­ing – he con­sulted a Taoist master, who ad­vised him to col­lect of­fer­ings only af­ter the can­dles and joss sticks have stopped burn­ing, and to ut­ter a word of thanks and bow as a sign of respect. The group also went out af­ter mid­night to avoid ques­tions from or mis­un­der­stand­ings with passers-by.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay first picked up fruit from road­side of­fer­ings last year, when he landed 130 or­anges.</p>
    <p>“My mother was be­wil­dered when I brought so many or­anges home. But this year, she is look­ing for­ward to hav­ing or­ange juice,” he says.</p>
    <p>He de­cided to ask his friends along this year, af­ter he was asked sev­eral times if free­gans could col­lect food of­fer­ings left be­hind by wor­ship­pers.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Choo Beng, 62, a Taoist priest for 39 years, says it is fine to do so af­ter prayer rites are com­plete and the joss sticks, can­dles and joss paper have fin­ished burn­ing.</p>
    <p>He adds: “Some of th­ese of­fer­ings are meant for wan­der­ing ghosts, who may not have liv­ing kin to pray for and make of­fer­ings to them. The of­fer­ings are sym­bols of respect for the dead.”</p>
    <p>As for the fear that the wan­der­ing spir­its may be of­fended, Mr Tan says it is a su­per­sti­tious mis­con­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay plans to have an­other out­ing on Wednesday, which will be the last day of the sev­enth month.</p>
    <p>He says with a chuckle: “I am still hop­ing that some­one will leave duri­ans as prayer of­fer­ings.”</p>
