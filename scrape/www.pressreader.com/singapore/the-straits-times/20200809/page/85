        | | The Sunday Times B17 Sunday, August 9, 2020 OUR SINGAPORE, WITH LOVE JR LIFE SCIENCES/HOLISTIC WAY A local feast for the eyes Holistic Way Super Vision — Eye Nutrition JR Life Sciences High Potency Eye Care Holistic Way Super Lutein S ingaporean­s love their food, so what better way to celebrate the nation’s 55th birthday than by tucking into your favourite local dishes? While the Little Red Dot has topped many internatio­nal rankings, it also has one of the highest myopia rates in the world. Besides wearing protective eyewear and exercising, one can complement a balanced diet by taking supplement­s that are packed with vitamins and nutrients such as lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-carotene and zinc. Find out what these supplement­s from JR Life Sciences and your favourite local dishes have in common. Nutrients: Nutrients: Lutein, Zeaxanthin, Coenzyme Q-10 Vitamin A,
Lutein, Multi-anthocyani­dins Nutrients: Zinc Zinc is concentrat­ed in the macula, which is part of the retina, and in the choroid, a vascular tissue layer behind the retina. The mineral transports vitamin A from the liver to the retina so that melanin, a protective pigment in the eyes, can be formed. A lack of zinc intake may lead to impaired vision such as poor night vision. Widely known as the eye vitamin, lutein is an antioxidan­t-rich dietary carotenoid found in the macula region of the retina. As a pigment, lutein helps to filter out harmful blue rays from the retina. Nutrition-wise, lutein is linked to vitamin A and beta-carotene, which are found in green leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale, egg yolks and red peppers. Vitamin A is crucial in maintainin­g photorecep­tors or light-sensing cells in the eyes. The vitamin also combats age-related macular degenerati­on, which causes one’s vision to deteriorat­e. It is often found in orange-hued food. Anthocyani­dins are often found in purple-coloured foods such as berries and are believed to improve blood circulatio­n and strengthen eye capillarie­s. Oyster omelette (orh luak) This hawker dish packs a savoury punch with plump and juicy oysters topping a bed of egg omelette fried till golden brown. Oysters are a particular­ly rich source of zinc. Trio egg spinach This comforting dish is a mainstay at zichar restaurant­s. The blanched spinach leaves are cooked with three types of egg: salted egg, century egg and regular egg in chicken stock spiked with Chinese cooking wine. Spinach is well-endowed with antioxidan­ts, lutein and zeaxanthin, and so are wolfberrie­s, which are often used as a garnish. Sweet potato ondeh ondeh This delightful orange-hued Nyonya kueh is made from steamed sweet potatoes and glutinous rice flour. Sweet potatoes are crammed with beta-carotene, an antioxidan­t that can be converted to vitamin A. They are also a good source of vitamin C and vitamin E. Each ball oozes with melted gula melaka, while its chewy exterior is coated with freshly grated coconut.
