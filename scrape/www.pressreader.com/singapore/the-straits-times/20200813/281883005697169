    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong prodemoc­racy me­dia mogul Jimmy Lai yes­ter­day told his re­porters to “fight on” fol­low­ing his dra­matic ar­rest, as China widens its crack­down on crit­ics in the semi-au­ton­o­mous busi­ness hub.</p>
    <p>A clam­p­down has gath­ered pace in Hong Kong since Bei­jing im­posed a sweep­ing se­cu­rity law in June, with op­po­si­tion politi­cians dis­qual­i­fied and ac­tivists ar­rested for so­cial me­dia posts.</p>
    <p>Lai, 71, was one of 10 peo­ple ar­rested by the po­lice on Mon­day as part of an op­er­a­tion against al­leged col­lu­sion with for­eign forces, a new of­fence un­der the se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>The ar­rests sparked a new cho­rus of in­ter­na­tional crit­i­cism that Bei­jing was stamp­ing out free­doms in the city, a key re­gional me­dia hub.</p>
    <p>Lai’s me­dia group Next Dig­i­tal is un­apolo­get­i­cally pro-democ­racy and crit­i­cal of Bei­jing, and China has hailed his ar­rest in a se­ries of</p>
    <p>Fight on! Let’s fight on... We have the sup­port of the Hong Kong peo­ple. We can’t let them down... But we should con­tinue our work... Luck­ily I was not ’’ sent back to the main­land. HONG KONG PRO-DEMOC­RACY ME­DIA MOGUL JIMMY LAI</p>
    <p>govern­ment state­ments.</p>
    <p>Lai was cheered by staff yes­ter­day morn­ing as he toured his Ap­ple Daily news­room fol­low­ing his re­lease on bail af­ter 40 hours in cus­tody. In im­ages broad­cast live on Face­book by his own re­porters, he told staff to con­tinue fil­ing the kind of un­var­nished dis­patches that have in­fu­ri­ated China and pro-Bei­jing politi­cians in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>“Fight on! Let’s fight on,” he said. “We have the sup­port of the Hong Kong peo­ple. We can’t let them down.” He also said it was be­com­ing “in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult” to run a me­dia busi­ness in Hong Kong. “But we should con­tinue our work.”</p>
    <p>“Luck­ily I was not sent back to the main­land,” he quipped in a char­ac­ter­is­tic dis­play of dark hu­mour.</p>
