    <p>I am part of a group of squash en­thu­si­asts who have been play­ing squash to­gether for the past 15 years.</p>
    <p>It has be­come in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult to se­cure squash court book­ings on a long-term ba­sis.</p>
    <p>There was a re­cent change in man­age­ment of the courts that we used to play on and, due to the price in­crease, we have had to look else­where.</p>
    <p>There are not many fa­cil­i­ties that have suf­fi­cient squash courts and that al­low long-term block book­ings. We asked in­sti­tu­tions such as the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, poly­tech­nics and other schools that have squash courts, some of which were up­graded re­cently, but were turned down.</p>
    <p>No clear rea­sons were given for the re­fusal, though some cited se­cu­rity is­sues.</p>
    <p>Un­like other sports clubs like for foot­ball, some of the squash clubs that take part in na­tional leagues do not have a home ground.</p>
    <p>Some of th­ese clubs have to rely on book­ing con­do­minium courts to host their op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>In land-scarce Sin­ga­pore, I hope the author­i­ties can bet­ter co­or­di­nate re­sources so that sports fa­cil­i­ties can be put to good use. What’s more, the money col­lected can help to main­tain the fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>I urge Sport Sin­ga­pore and schools to open up sports fa­cil­i­ties for the pub­lic to use.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity con­cerns can be eas­ily ad­dressed in a safe en­vi­ron­ment like Sin­ga­pore.</p>
