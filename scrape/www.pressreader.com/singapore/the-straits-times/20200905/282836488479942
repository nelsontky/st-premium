    <p>Is there a ser­vice in­ter­val for the air-con­di­tioner in cars? If so, what does it en­tail? In be­tween, do I need to top up the gas?</p>
    <p>Home own­ers have their air­con­di­tion­ing sys­tems ser­viced reg­u­larly, but most tend to ne­glect the sys­tem in their cars.</p>
    <p>As with the en­gine, brakes or tyres, a car’s air-con­di­tion­ing sys­tem re­quires reg­u­lar ser­vic­ing. There are fil­ters and com­po­nents in the re­frig­er­ant pip­ing loop that have to be cleaned, and drive belts to be re­placed.</p>
    <p>Even if your car’s hand­book does not spec­ify a ser­vice in­ter­val for the air-con, it is a good idea to do so – at the very least, once ev­ery 60,000km or ev­ery four years, whichever comes first.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing ser­vic­ing, the en­tire re­frig­er­ant net­work should be flushed. This would re­move any for­eign par­ti­cles that may have been de­posited from de­te­ri­o­rat­ing el­e­ments such as the in­ter­nals of the re­ceiver-dryer or ex­pan­sion valve. A proper job means re­plac­ing at least the re­ceiver-dryer be­fore re­fill­ing with fresh re­frig­er­ant.</p>
    <p>A new air fil­ter for the evap­o­ra­tor in the car is highly rec­om­mended be­cause it inevitably picks up minute par­ti­cles from the out­side. A choked air fil­ter cre­ates an in­creased re­sis­tance to the air flow past the evap­o­ra­tor and nat­u­rally re­duces the over­all ef­fi­ciency of the air-con.</p>
    <p>The com­pres­sor can last as long as 10 years. Un­less there has been a re­frig­er­ant leak, there is no rou­tine main­te­nance nec­es­sary for the com­pres­sor ex­cept per­haps to re­new the drive belt.</p>
    <p>There is no need to top up re­frig­er­ant (“gas”) in be­tween main­te­nance rou­tines, as the re­frig­er­ant sys­tem is closed-loop and the re­frig­er­ant is not con­sumed. If the re­frig­er­ant pres­sure is low, it just means there is a leak in the sys­tem which must be re­paired.</p>
    <p>Con­tin­u­ing to use a leaky air-con will ul­ti­mately cause per­ma­nent dam­age to the com­pres­sor.</p>
