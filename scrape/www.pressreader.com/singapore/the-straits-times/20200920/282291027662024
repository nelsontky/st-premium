    <p>He was pre­vi­ously pres­i­dent of Hwa Chong Ju­nior Col­lege’s stu­dents’ coun­cil and a Sin­ga­pore Ex­change schol­ar­ship holder and used to earn $24,000 a month work­ing for a Ja­panese bank.</p>
    <p>But af­ter get­ting re­trenched, he was so broke that he ate $2.50 econ­omy rice ev­ery day and put his chil­dren on food coupons.</p>
    <p>He had to bor­row a five-fig­ure sum from his elder brother to pay his bills.</p>
    <p>Such was the painful, hum­bling re­al­ity Mr Eu­gene Seah faced when he was let go by fi­nan­cial services group No­mura in 2013 af­ter a com­pany re­struc­tur­ing ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, who is mar­ried to a house­wife and has three young chil­dren, had to move back from Hong Kong, where he was then based, into a four-room HDB flat in Toa Payoh.</p>
    <p>By his own ad­mis­sion, the fi­nan­cial dis­as­ter that fol­lowed was partly due to poor fi­nan­cial de­ci­sions on his part.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore with about three months in re­trench­ment ben­e­fits, he bought a used car, which he sold within six months, los­ing a five-fig­ure sum in the process.</p>
    <p>In a bid to make money, he fell prey to two fi­nan­cial scams and lost close to $20,000.</p>
    <p>He says: “In those early months, I was very com­pla­cent, think­ing it would be very easy find­ing an­other job.”</p>
    <p>But as the months passed, the of­fers dwin­dled and so did his sav­ings.</p>
    <p>Des­per­ate, he asked his brother for a loan to tide him over and also sought fi­nan­cial aid.</p>
    <p>His chil­dren were placed on a fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance scheme and were given food coupons, free text­books and school at­tire.</p>
    <p>He himself was given a Work­fare Trans­port Con­ces­sion Card, which al­lowed him to get dis­counted fares on pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>“At that point, I felt very low and con­fused. How did I end up in this state? I was the pres­i­dent of the stu­dents’ coun­cil and many of my peers had be­come chief ex­ec­u­tives and chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cers. I was a good stu­dent and ex­celled in my CCAs – what did I do wrong?” he re­counts.</p>
    <p>Around this time, he found strength in his faith. The Chris­tian shared his per­sonal and fi­nan­cial strug­gles in church, which was how his mother, Madam Jen­nifer Tan, got to know of them.</p>
    <p>The wid­owed re­tiree, who is now 82, says: “When I heard Eu­gene was re­trenched, I saw how stressed he was and felt very sad. I wanted to help him, but I could not be­cause it is his life.</p>
    <p>“I could only en­cour­age him to be stronger and do bet­ter and be more un­der­stand­ing to­wards him.”</p>
    <p>Hop­ing to take Mr Seah’s mind off his wor­ries, Madam Tan in­vited him on out­ings to watch movies and win­dow-shop; she also paid for their meals.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, she told him to dis­con­tinue her $400 monthly al­lowance be­cause of his cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>But he in­sisted on giv­ing her at least half the amount.</p>
    <p>With his mother’s en­cour­age­ment, Mr Seah slowly picked up the pieces. He founded a cor­po­rate train­ing services com­pany, Trainium Academy, in 2014 and de­cided to be­come a trainer and life coach.</p>
    <p>For most of 2015, he pro­vided train­ing and gave pub­lic speeches for free at places such as schools and cor­po­rate or­gan­i­sa­tions, while net­work­ing ex­ten­sively and hon­ing his pre­sen­ta­tion skills.</p>
    <p>A year later, in 2016, he be­gan charg­ing for th­ese ses­sions – start­ing from $200 a day and work­ing his way up to $1,000 a day.</p>
    <p>He also be­gan de­sign­ing cus­tomised train­ing and coach­ing pro­grammes for or­gan­i­sa­tions, help­ing them solve cor­po­rate prob­lems such as l ow morale and high turnover among staff.</p>
    <p>His clients in­clude or­gan­i­sa­tions such as bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Fer­ring Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and car parts sup­plier Con­ti­nen­tal.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, from 2017, he be­came a fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant, us­ing his past money mishaps to ed­u­cate oth­ers so they can avoid mak­ing sim­i­lar mis­takes.</p>
    <p>He has also given talks over­seas to au­di­ences as large as 1,500 peo­ple. His cur­rent coach­ing rate has in­creased to $8,000 a day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter years of fru­gal liv­ing, Mr Seah’s fi­nan­cial sit­u­a­tion has im­proved.</p>
    <p>In 2018, he was in­vited back to his alma mater – now known as Hwa Chong In­sti­tu­tion – as a guest of honour at the in­vesti­ture of its stu­dents’ coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old now makes more than he did in his pre­vi­ous cor­po­rate job. His chil­dren are now aged 10 to 16.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, he re­flects that if he had been more fi­nan­cially pru­dent when he was un­em­ployed, he could have saved a lot of heartache.</p>
    <p>“I should not have as­sumed it would be easy to get an­other job af­ter be­ing re­trenched. None­the­less, dur­ing those dark days, I was very thank­ful to my mother for al­ways be­ing an emo­tional pil­lar of sup­port for me.”</p>
    <p>Madam Tan adds: “I am proud Eu­gene has picked himself up, is happy and is now also help­ing oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“When our chil­dren lose their jobs, they are al­ready stressed enough.</p>
    <p>“We as par­ents should try as much as pos­si­ble to love and sup­port them and not judge them.”</p>
