    <p>Mid­night at Block 322 Hougang Avenue 5 on Polling Day. Sup­port­ers of the Work­ers’ Party thronged the green out­side the cof­fee shop that is the party’s un­of­fi­cial strong­hold and spilled over the road, dot­ting the slopes on the other side. The air was raw with chant­ing.</p>
    <p>No­body had called them and yet they had come to­gether, from the griz­zled un­cles swig­ging beer and bel­low­ing sam­ple count re­sults, to a 25-year-old first-time voter, who sounded as dazed as I felt. “I’m sur­prised too,” he said. “I was just driv­ing by, and I saw them here.”</p>
    <p>I was trans­fixed. It was like a scene from an­other world, an­other time be­fore Covid-19 made us fear one an­other’s pres­ence. The ca­coph­ony of cheers, the ve­hi­cles honk­ing their horns in an­swer as they rolled past. The joy of call and re­sponse, of com­mon ground.</p>
    <p>There was the cleaner in his 60s, whirling a red flag around his head in a ring of cheer­ing on­look­ers, rel­ish­ing be­ing the cen­tre of at­ten­tion for a change. There was the of­fice worker rolling up his sleeves to help men in T-shirts and flip-flops string up a sky-blue ban­ner from the third floor of Block 322. There was the de­liv­ery worker, tears in her eyes, say­ing in Man­darin: “Beau­ti­ful, too beau­ti­ful.”</p>
    <p>I struck up a con­ver­sa­tion with a cou­ple who had ar­rived from Ke­bun Baru SMC with their two daugh­ters, aged 15 and 10.</p>
    <p>“It’s a sort of com­ing-of-age for the older one,” said the woman, who gave her name as Mrs Chan, 45. “I want them to see what true-blooded pas­sion in a peo­ple looks like, what­ever po­lit­i­cal party they sup­port. This isn’t a text­book ver­sion of his­tory writ­ten by the vic­tors.”</p>
    <p>All the days we have lived through this pan­demic have been his­toric, though this night was his­toric in its own way. Be­fore dawn, the Work­ers’ Party would go on to win an un­prece­dented 10 seats in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The peo­ple in Hougang did not yet know this, but they had gath­ered for their rev­els any­way. Some of them had been lonely for so long. Some­times you do not want to make his­tory alone.</p>
    <p>I was afraid of them; I was afraid for them. None of us knows what we carry in­side our bod­ies any more. I had for­got­ten what pas­sion looked like, the hook of it catch­ing deep in your chest. I had for­got­ten how ter­ri­fy­ing free­dom could be.</p>
    <p>The world is try­ing to ne­go­ti­ate the fine bal­ance of re­sum­ing so­cial life for their pent-up pop­u­la­tions, even as Covid-19 con­tin­ues to lurk in their midst. Coun­tries are at­tempt­ing to restart economies, re­open schools and, in the case of Sin­ga­pore, hold an elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Be­fore this, I had spent 21/</p>
    <p>2 months cooped up at home, thanks to a stay-home no­tice, the end of which dove­tailed with the be­gin­ning of cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>I had gone through my own set of phases in this time. There was the phase when I would cry in the bath­room from the small­est things, like read­ing the head­lines or lis­ten­ing to Bob Dy­lan’s lat­est mu­sic.</p>
    <p>There was the phase when I tried to for­get my sur­round­ings by work­ing 15 hours a day un­til I couldn’t see straight.</p>
    <p>This, I hoped, com­pen­sated for the phase when I felt so phys­i­cally heavy in my body that I just lay on my face and did noth­ing for long stretches of time.</p>
    <p>By June, I had en­tered the phase where I won­dered if I would ever be ca­pa­ble of leav­ing the house again. Not be­cause I doubted the Gov­ern­ment would lift the cir­cuit breaker, but be­cause, hav­ing spent so long in­side, I did not think I could han­dle the world out­side any more. Was it still there, the way I re­mem­bered it? Was I?</p>
    <p>“We are not the same peo­ple,” a se­nior col­league told me in an un­ex­pect­edly philo­soph­i­cal pre-break­fast phone call. “We have changed. The ques­tion is, do we know how?”</p>
    <p>In the end, the job sorted things out for me, as it usu­ally does. I was forced to give up my funk when Par­lia­ment was dis­solved and the elec­tion got un­der way.</p>
    <p>Be­fore I knew it, I was fol­low­ing a min­is­ter on a walk­a­bout through a wet mar­ket. I was dizzy with the sights, sounds and smells of it, the bod­ies of other shop­pers as I ducked and weaved among them like an elab­o­rate ob­sta­cle course.</p>
    <p>I went me­chan­i­cally through the mo­tions of re­portage, though in­side I was still as stunned as if some­body had picked up one of the fish cuts on dis­play and slapped me in the face with it.</p>
    <p>The world was still here and it was daz­zlingly, re­mark­ably as I re­mem­bered it – which is to say, still full of irate aun­ties whose el­bows you did not want to be on the busi­ness end of.</p>
    <p>It was a strange sort of elec­tion. Can­di­dates were in­tro­duced over Zoom. E-ral­lies were streamed on Face­book. At the nom­i­na­tion cen­tres, elec­tion of­fi­cers shouted at us when­ever it seemed a me­dia scrum was nigh. I kicked off my shoes and climbed onto a can­teen ta­ble for a bet­ter view. So­cial dis­tanc­ing for small peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Some of the can­di­dates kept wav­ing at in­vis­i­ble crowds dur­ing their thank-you speeches, though there was only a smat­ter­ing of re­porters in the echo­ing pa­rade square. We turned to see whom they were wav­ing at, even though we knew there was no­body be­hind us. No ap­plause, just awkward si­lence.</p>
    <p>On the cam­paign trail, I was cor­nered by a Mr Tan, who re­galed me with his opin­ions of how the Gov­ern­ment was do­ing the peo­ple dirty by favour­ing for­eign work­ers and with­hold­ing CPF (Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund).</p>
    <p>I tried to lis­ten po­litely, but was dis­tracted by the way his mask kept slip­ping down his chin. He grabbed at the me­dia pass hang­ing around my neck with­out ask­ing. I watched in dis­may as a fleck of his spit­tle landed on my arm.</p>
    <p>Back home, I fu­ri­ously soaped my arms up to the el­bows and wiped my pass with al­co­hol for good mea­sure. Per­haps not ev­ery­one is chang­ing fast enough.</p>
    <p>On Polling Day, all of Sin­ga­pore formed lines for the bal­lot box. Long hours, hot sun, rain, prob­lem­atic gloves – we queued. It was in­con­ve­nient to be sure, but damn it, we were all go­ing to get it done.</p>
    <p>It took me an hour to vote. I spent it ob­serv­ing the oth­ers in line, with a de­light still fresh from months of not see­ing any­one out­side my house­hold.</p>
    <p>Neigh­bours recog­nised one an­other in the queue and shot ban­ter over the heads of strangers and across party lines.</p>
    <p>I thought of the David Bowie song Five Years: “And all the no­body peo­ple, and all the some­body peo­ple/I never thought I’d need so many peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>I am still afraid of go­ing out. I am afraid of the fu­ture and the myr­iad un­cer­tain­ties hid­den in its folds: the re­ces­sion, a pos­si­ble sec­ond wave of in­fec­tion, even a re­turn of the cir­cuit breaker. But we have to get on with it, with the messy busi­ness of liv­ing in the world we have cho­sen. We have to do the work.</p>
    <p>Maybe one day we will be free to meet once more in crowds with­out fear, to queue or scream or sing in the name of some­thing big­ger than our­selves with­out the shadow of dis­ease loom­ing over us.</p>
    <p>I dream, but I do not think it will hap­pen soon. All I have is the mask on my face and the mem­o­ries of stand­ing in line, clutch­ing my vot­ing card, and mid­night at Block 322 Hougang, the swelling roar, the beat of the drum, the ham­mer­ing of my heart.</p>
