    <p>• In­dia’s anti-money laun­der­ing agency fined Stan­dard Char­tered one bil­lion ru­pees (S$18.5 mil­lion) for break­ing for­eign ex­change rules when it worked on t he takeover of a lo­cal bank, mark­ing one of the coun­try’s big­gest penal­ties im­posed on an overseas lender.</p>
    <p>An eight-year probe found that Stan­dard Char­tered vi­o­lated the so­called For­eign Ex­change Man­age­ment Act – which mon­i­tors off­shore fi­nan­cial transactio­ns – when it worked with a group of in­vestors to buy a stake in Tamil­nad Mer­can­tile Bank (TMB) in 2007, ac­cord­ing to an Au­gust or­der from In­dia’s en­force­ment agency that was seen by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>“Se­nior of­fi­cials at Stan­dard Char­tered saw an in­vest­ment in TMB shares as an op­por­tu­nity that might ripen into an even­tu­ally larger own­er­ship for the bank,” the en­force­ment agency’s spe­cial di­rec­tor, Mr Sushil Ku­mar, said in the or­der.</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for the Bri­tish lender con­firmed re­ceipt of the or­der, adding that the bank was eval­u­at­ing it and so was un­able to com­ment fur­ther.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered – In­dia’s largest for­eign bank by branches – has been op­er­at­ing in the coun­try for more than 160 years and has about 100 out­lets. The bank also acted as a cus­to­dian for shares on the deal, ac­cord­ing to the or­der. Tamil­nad Mer­can­tile was fined al­most 170 mil­lion ru­pees for sim­i­lar charges, the or­der said.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Tamil­nad Mer­can­tile de­clined to com­ment, while the En­force­ment Direc­torate did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to an email seek­ing com­ment.</p>
    <p>The case dates back to about 13 years ago when Tamil­nad Mer­can­tile trans­ferred 46,862 shares to overseas in­vestors, in­clud­ing GHI, Swiss Re In­vestors, FI In­vest­ments and Cuna Group, with­out seek­ing per­mis­sion from In­dia’s cen­tral bank, ac­cord­ing to the or­der.</p>
    <p>Some of those shares were then trans­ferred to Sub­con­ti­nen­tal Eq­ui­ties, an af­fil­i­ate of Stan­dard Char­tered, in April 2008 with­out the Re­serve Bank of In­dia’s per­mis­sion, it said. The trans­fers were done through es­crow ac­counts with Stan­dard Char­tered, which acted as a trans­ac­tion agent and a lender to one of the in­vestors on the deal, the or­der said.</p>
    <p>“Stan­dard Char­tered through its af­fil­i­ate Sub­con­ti­nen­tal was a pro­posed and even­tu­ally an ac­tual in­vestor in TMB shares to be pur­chased through the es­crow agree­ment ar­range­ments,” Mr Ku­mar said.</p>
