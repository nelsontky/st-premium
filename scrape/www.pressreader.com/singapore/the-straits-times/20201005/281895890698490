    <p>•</p>
    <p>The French South Pa­cific ter­ri­tory of New Cale­do­nia nar­rowly re­jected in­de­pen­dence in a ref­er­en­dum yes­ter­day, the ar­chi­pel­ago’s High Com­mis­sion said af­ter a par­tial count of the votes.</p>
    <p>The anti-in­de­pen­dence vote fell to 53.3 per cent, ac­cord­ing to the 70 per cent of bal­lots counted, down from 56.7 per cent in a pre­vi­ous ref­er­en­dum two years ago, it said.</p>
    <p>Turnout was high at 85.5 per cent, the Com­mis­sion said, re­flect­ing the en­thu­si­asm of vot­ers who had formed long queues to cast their bal­lots.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s ref­er­en­dum was part of a care­fully ne­go­ti­ated de­coloni­sa­tion plan agreed upon in 1998, which ended a deadly con­flict be­tween the mostly pro-in­de­pen­dence indige­nous Kanak pop­u­la­tion and the de­scen­dants of Euro­pean set­tlers.</p>
    <p>An­other ref­er­en­dum can be held by 2022 as long as vot­ing is re­quested by at least a third of the lo­cal leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>A sur­prise “yes” vote would de­prive Paris of a foothold in a re­gion where China is ex­pand­ing its in­flu­ence and dent the pride of a coun­try whose for­mer em­pire once spanned sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa,</p>
    <p>South-east Asia, the Caribbean and the Pa­cific Ocean.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions have long run deep be­tween the pro-in­de­pen­dence Kanaks and the de­scen­dants of colo­nial set­tlers who re­main loyal to Paris.</p>
    <p>More than 180,000 long-term res­i­dents of New Cale­do­nia are reg­is­tered to vote “yes” or “no” on the ques­tion: Do you want New Cale­do­nia to gain its full sovereignt­y and be­come in­de­pen­dent?</p>
    <p>The ref­er­en­dum was the sec­ond of up to three per­mit­ted un­der the terms of the 1998 Noumea Ac­cord, an agree­ment en­shrined in France’s Con­sti­tu­tion and which sets out a 20-year path to­wards de­coloni­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Turnout was high af­ter a stronger-than-ex­pected in­de­pen­dence vote in the 2018 ref­er­en­dum.</p>
    <p>New Cale­do­nia, an is­land chain some 1,200km east of Aus­tralia and 20,000km from Paris, en­joys a large de­gree of au­ton­omy but de­pends heav­ily on France for mat­ters such as de­fence and education.</p>
    <p>Some­times called “The Peb­ble”, it has 270,000 in­hab­i­tants and has been French since 1873.</p>
    <p>Its econ­omy is un­der­pinned by an­nual French sub­si­dies of some €1.3 bil­lion (S$1.8 bil­lion), nickel de­posits that are es­ti­mated to rep­re­sent 25 per cent of the world’s to­tal, and tourism.</p>
    <p>The ter­ri­tory has, how­ever, largely cut it­self off from the out­side world to shield it­self from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>It has reg­is­tered only 27 cases of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>If the “no” vote wins, a third ref­er­en­dum can be held within two years if a third of the lo­cal assem­bly votes in favour of it.</p>
    <p>The 1998 de­coloni­sa­tion plan, called the Noumea Ac­cord, ended the con­flict in the 1980s be­tween the Kanak pop­u­la­tion and de­scen­dants of Euro­pean set­tlers known as “Cal­doches”.</p>
    <p>That vi­o­lence cul­mi­nated in a bloody, drawn-out hostage cri­sis in 1988 that saw 19 sep­a­ratists killed on one side, and six po­lice and spe­cial forces on the other.</p>
    <p>Since New Cale­do­nia has largely avoided the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, 294 polling sta­tions yes­ter­day opened at 8am and closed at 6pm.</p>
    <p>Though the first ref­er­en­dum in 2018 re­sulted in the main­te­nance of the sta­tus quo with 56.7 per cent of the vote, it still marked a shift to­wards pro-in­de­pen­dence sym­pa­thies, rais­ing cam­paign­ers’ hopes that this time it could man­age to break free.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one knows there is go­ing to be no change on Sun­day,” gov­ern­ment chief Thierry Santa, who favours stay­ing with France, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>The real is­sue was to know how much of a lead one side had over the other, he added.</p>
    <p>Some see stay­ing with France as the only prac­ti­cal way for­ward, while oth­ers do not want to lose the chance of full in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Mr Carl Le­clerc, a man­ager, said: “I made the choice a long time ago be­cause we want to en­sure the fu­ture of our chil­dren and our fu­ture also on the ter­ri­tory. This choice is ‘no’, it is sim­ply to stay with France.”</p>
    <p>But Mr Pierre Go­cho, a Kanak, said: “For me it is ‘yes’ be­cause we want our coun­try in our hands and to go fur­ther than au­ton­omy.”</p>
