    <p>IZMIR (Turkey) A young girl was res­cued from the rub­ble of a build­ing in the western Turk­ish city of Izmir yes­ter­day, one day after a three-year-old girl was pulled out alive from a col­lapsed build­ing fol­low­ing a 6.6-mag­ni­tude quake.</p>
    <p>Res­cuers heard the screams of Ayda Gez­gin – said to be four years old – from un­der the rub­ble and man­aged to pull her out hours later.</p>
    <p>She was taken out on a stretcher as emer­gency teams con­tin­ued to search five apart­ment blocks for sur­vivors.</p>
    <p>Im­ages showed a res­cue worker hug­ging Ayda after she was found un­der the de­bris, cov­ered in dust. Crowds i n the area ap­plauded work­ers after they car­ried away the young girl.</p>
    <p>“She smiled, she was wait­ing for us,” said res­cue worker Levent Onur, who was among those who pulled Ayda out. The child had been stuck be­hind a wash­ing ma­chine that shielded her from in­jury.</p>
    <p>“The name of our mir­a­cle after 91 hours is Ayda. Thank God,” Cab­i­net min­is­ter Mu­rat Ku­rum said in a Twitter post.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, another young girl was res­cued from a col­lapsed build­ing nearly three days after the quake hit the Aegean Sea off Izmir last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Three-year-old Elif Per­incek was pulled from the rub­ble and car­ried by res­cue work­ers on a stretcher to an am­bu­lance. Elif is now re­cov­er­ing in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Her two sis­ters and a brother were res­cued along with their mother last Satur­day, but one of the chil­dren sub­se­quently died.</p>
    <p>The quake was the dead­li­est to hit Turkey in nearly a decade, killing 102 peo­ple in Izmir and two teenagers on the Greek is­land of Samos, the au­thor­i­ties said. The quake also in­jured 1,026 peo­ple, with 143 still re­ceiv­ing treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Turkey is crossed by fault lines and is prone to earth­quakes.</p>
    <p>More than 500 peo­ple died in a 2011 quake in the east­ern city of Van, while another i n Jan­uary killed 41 in the east­ern prov­ince of Elazig.</p>
