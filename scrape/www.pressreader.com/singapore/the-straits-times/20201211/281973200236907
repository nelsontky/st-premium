    <p>In her let­ter, Ms Shirley Woon called for a more proac­tive ap­proach to teach students to pro­tect them­selves (Teach students to pro­tect them­selves against sex of­fend­ers, Dec 7).</p>
    <p>It is worth not­ing that the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion’s Grow­ing Years sex­u­al­ity ed­u­ca­tion cur­ricu­lum, tar­geted at students from Pri­mary 5 to ju­nior col­lege level, al­ready in­cludes a sec­tion on safety and pro­tec­tion from sex­ual abuse and groom­ing.</p>
    <p>I would ar­gue that the re­spon­si­bil­ity for pre­vent­ing sex­ual mis­con­duct should not fall pri­mar­ily on vic­tims or students. It must be stressed that just be­cause some­one is in­formed does not mean that this per­son is im­mune from un­wanted sex­ual ad­vances or at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion can help students iden­tify po­ten­tially dan­ger­ous sit­u­a­tions and may pre­vent them from be­ing put in those sit­u­a­tions to be­gin with, but there are many in­stances where vic­tims of sex­ual ha­rass­ment or as­sault find them­selves un­able to de­fend against their as­sailant or pre­vent an as­sault from tak­ing place.</p>
    <p>In the case of stu­dent-teacher re­la­tion­ships, it can be es­pe­cially dif­fi­cult for students to ex­tri­cate them­selves from a dif­fi­cult sit­u­a­tion for fear of an­ger­ing a teacher who is much older than them and in a sig­nif­i­cant po­si­tion of au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>The sug­ges­tion that a per­sonal act of strength or willpower alone is enough to pre­vent a sex­ual as­sault can in­ten­sify feel­ings of guilt in sur­vivors. It im­plies the dam­ag­ing idea that a vic­tim of a sex crime sim­ply “didn’t do enough”, and ig­nores sit­u­a­tions where fight­ing back may ac­tu­ally place a vic­tim in fur­ther dan­ger.</p>
    <p>The safety and well-be­ing of students should al­ways be the ut­most pri­or­ity of any ed­u­ca­tor. Any sex ed­u­ca­tion pro­gramme must work with an in­formed in­ves­ti­ga­tion and disciplina­ry pro­ce­dure that is stan­dard­ised and open, and that keeps the in­ter­ests of vic­tims at heart.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve that an ex­panded sex ed­u­ca­tion pro­gramme should teach students about the im­por­tance of con­sent, in­form them about sex­ual ha­rass­ment and as­sault, and help them learn how to treat one another with re­spect.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the ul­ti­mate re­spon­si­bil­ity lies with the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion and the ad­min­is­tra­tions of ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions to cre­ate an en­vi­ron­ment and sys­tem where students and vic­tims are knowl­edge­able and com­fort­able enough to seek help if any as­sault oc­curs.</p>
