    <p>In­vestors sold off Kep­pel Corp af­ter Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek walked away from its $4.1 bil­lion con­di­tional of­fer for the con­glom­er­ate.</p>
    <p>The sur­prise move came af­ter Kep­pel posted a sec­ond-quar­ter net loss of $697.6 mil­lion, breach­ing a pre­con­di­tion for Te­masek’s of­fer.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel shares dived 11.11 per cent, or 60 cents, to close at $4.80 yes­ter­day. The stock, which plunged by as much as 12.8 per cent at the open­ing bell, has lost around 29 per cent since the start of the year.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket watch­ers said they were sur­prised by the tim­ing of Mon­day’s an­nounce­ment, which came well be­fore Aug 31, the date by which Te­masek said it would make its de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>The with­drawal also came a day ahead of the ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ings of Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries and Sem­b­corp Marine (Sem­bMarine), where share­hold­ers were to pass judg­ment on a de­merger of Sem­bMarine from its par­ent.</p>
    <p>Te­masek’s role in mak­ing a par­tial of­fer for Kep­pel and mov­ing to di­rectly own a stake in Sem­bMarine had been viewed by many as crit­i­cal for a con­sol­i­da­tion of the strug­gling off­shore and marine sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“It’s a pru­dent move by Te­masek to walk out” of the Kep­pel bid, said Azure Cap­i­tal chief ex­ec­u­tive and founder Ter­ence Wong. “Te­masek still owns about 20 per cent of Kep­pel. What’s to stop it from do­ing a deal down the road?”</p>
    <p>He added: “There are strong mer­its for a de­merger. It’s def­i­nitely good for Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries share­hold­ers as that will cull a bleed­ing unit. And... I be­lieve a Kep­pel-Sem­bMarine merger is just a mat­ter of time.”</p>
    <p>Kyan­ite In­vest­ment Hold­ings, a unit of Te­masek, in­voked a ma­te­rial ad­verse change clause in pulling out of the deal, a bourse fil­ing said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The Se­cu­ri­ties In­dus­try Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore has no ob­jec­tion to Te­masek’s move.</p>
    <p>The ma­te­rial ad­verse change clause man­dated that Kep­pel’s af­ter-tax profit must not fall by more than 20 per cent, or be­low $557 mil­lion, over the cu­mu­la­tive four quar­ters from the third quar­ter ended Sept 30 last year.</p>
    <p>But the clause was breached when Kep­pel re­ported that its cu­mu­la­tive loss af­ter tax for the year to June 30 stood at $165 mil­lion, hit by $919 mil­lion in pro­vi­sions for Kep­pel Off­shore & Marine’s con­tract as­sets, doubt­ful debt and its share of im­pair­ment pro­vi­sions aris­ing from its Floa­tel as­so­ciate.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel said on Mon­day the Te­masek of­fer was “un­so­licited” and that it had not ne­go­ti­ated the terms of the deal, in­clud­ing the ma­te­rial ad­verse change clause. It added that “there was no cer­tainty that the pre-con­di­tions would be sat­is­fied or waived and that the par­tial of­fer would be made”.</p>
    <p>“Notwith­stand­ing the with­drawal of the par­tial of­fer, we in­tend to en­gage Te­masek, which re­mains our sin­gle largest share­holder, to ex­plore op­por­tu­ni­ties for strate­gic col­lab­o­ra­tion,” Kep­pel added.</p>
    <p>“We con­tinue to be­lieve in the in­her­ent value of Kep­pel’s business, and have a strong bal­ance sheet and sup­port from our net­work of banks to fi­nance op­er­a­tions and growth ini­tia­tives,” the com­pany added.</p>
    <p>DBS Eq­uity Re­search, which down­graded Kep­pel to “hold” from “buy”, said: “While an­other of­fer for Kep­pel by Te­masek over the next 12 months might be less likely, re­quir­ing Se­cu­ri­ties In­dus­try Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore’s con­sent, we can’t rule out other po­ten­tial plans on the re­struc­tur­ing of Kep­pel.”</p>
    <p>CGS-CIMB con­tin­ued to rec­om­mend “add” on Kep­pel but “only af­ter the share price shock sub­sides”, while OCBC In­vest­ment Re­search has a “buy” rat­ing as it sees value in the stock even though “any short (sell­ing) ac­tiv­ity could cause prices to over­shoot on the down­side”.</p>
