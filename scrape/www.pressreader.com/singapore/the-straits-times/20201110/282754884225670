    <p>GLAS­GOW K-pop stars BTS picked up four prizes at the MTV Europe Mu­sic Awards on Sun­day, in­clud­ing Best Song for Dy­na­mite and Best Group, cap­ping a year in which the South Korean band un­der­lined their sta­tus as a ma­jor global act.</p>
    <p>BTS’ first English-lan­guage song, Dy­na­mite, logged nearly 34 mil­lion United States streams and 300,000 sales in its first week, mak­ing the group the first South Korean act to de­but at No. 1 in the US Bill­board Hot 100 sin­gles chart.</p>
    <p>The seven-mem­ber band also snagged MTV awards for Best Vir­tual Live act and the Big­gest Fans, although the coro­n­avirus pan­demic meant there was no au­di­ence and no cer­e­mony to mark their achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the mu­sic chan­nel cre­ated a vir­tual sta­dium full of wav­ing and cheer­ing fans for the event, with acts ap­pear­ing in pre-recorded per­for­mances from wher­ever they were lo­cated and win­ners ac­cept­ing awards on cam­era.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish band Lit­tle Mix hosted the show with­out mem­ber Jesy Nel­son, who was re­ported to be ill. They ap­peared on a com­puter-gen­er­ated stage within the “sta­dium”.</p>
    <p>In a nod to the pan­demic, Amer­i­can rap­per Jack Har­low sang Whats Pop­pin on a stage with four dancers wear­ing face masks.</p>
    <p>Karol G won in the new Best Latin cat­e­gory and Best Col­lab­o­ra­tion for Tusa fea­tur­ing Nicki Mi­naj. Lady Gaga took the Best Artist award, while DJ Khaled was awarded Best Video.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle Mix, who per­formed Sweet Melody in a per­for­mance recorded in Lon­don, won the Best Pop prize this year.</p>
    <p>Cardi B was named Best Hip-Hop act, Cold­play won in the Best Rock cat­e­gory and Hay­ley Wil­liams won the Best Al­ter­na­tive award.</p>
    <p>Among the per­form­ers were Ali­cia Keys, who sang Love Looks Bet­ter, and Sam Smith, who per­formed Di­a­monds on the stage of an empty theatre.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can singer and rap­per Doja Cat, who took home this year’s Best New act award, opened the show with her hit Say So.</p>
    <p>French DJ and pro­ducer David Guetta, who won the Best Elec­tronic award, per­formed Let’s Love with Bri­tish singer Raye at the Szechenyi Bath com­plex in the Hun­gar­ian cap­i­tal Bu­dapest, ac­com­pa­nied by a laser show.</p>
