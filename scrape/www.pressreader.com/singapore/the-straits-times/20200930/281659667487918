    <p>Pre­mi­ums and ben­e­fits un­der Sin­ga­pore’s MediShield Life in­sur­ance scheme are set to rise if rec­om­men­da­tions by the MediShield Life Council are ac­cepted. The pro­posed changes will likely be im­ple­mented early next year.</p>
    <p>Here are some an­swers to fre­quently asked ques­tions about the scheme.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>What is MediShield Life and whom does it cover?</p>
    <p>A MediShield Life is a com­pul­sory univer­sal health in­sur­ance scheme ad­min­is­tered by the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Board that helps cover large hos­pi­tal bills, in­clud­ing surgery and ward charges, and some costly out­pa­tient treat­ments, such as dial­y­sis for kid­ney fail­ure and chemo­ther­apy for can­cer.</p>
    <p>The scheme of­fers all Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents au­to­matic lifetime cover­age f rom birth, re­gard­less of age or pre-ex­ist­ing health con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>If the MediShield Life Council’s rec­om­men­da­tions are ac­cepted, the an­nual pol­icy claim limit will be raised from the cur­rent $100,000 to $150,000.</p>
    <p>Be­fore pa­tients can get MediShield Life pay­outs, they must first pay a de­ductible of be­tween $1,500 and $3,000 once each pol­icy year. This sieves out smaller hos­pi­tal bills be­cause MediShield Life is meant to cover large bills.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>How is it dif­fer­ent from Medis­ave, Med­i­fund and other govern­ment in­sur­ance schemes?</p>
    <p>A MediShield Life is a med­i­cal in­sur­ance scheme, while Medis­ave and Med­i­fund are med­i­cal fi­nanc­ing schemes.</p>
    <p>Medis­ave is a med­i­cal sav­ings scheme that helps in­di­vid­u­als set aside part of their in­come in their CPF ac­counts to pay for their per­sonal med­i­cal ex­penses or that of their ap­proved de­pen­dants.</p>
    <p>It can be used to pay the pre­mi­ums for MediShield Life and other govern­ment in­sur­ance schemes, such as ElderShiel­d and CareShield Life – which cover only those above a cer­tain age – as well as In­te­grated Shield Plans (IPs), which in­clude MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>Med­i­fund is an en­dow­ment fund that pro­vides a safety net for Sin­ga­pore­ans who face fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties in pay­ing their med­i­cal bills even after re­ceiv­ing govern­ment sub­si­dies and tap­ping other means of pay­ment, in­clud­ing MediShield Life and Medis­ave.</p>
    <p>MediShield Life does not sub­sidise vis­its to a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner, poly­clinic or most other spe­cialised out­pa­tient clin­ics.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are cov­ered by the Com­mu­nity Health As­sist Scheme, a dif­fer­ent pro­gramme for which all Sin­ga­pore­ans can ap­ply.</p>
    <p>Q What if I do not have enough in my Medis­ave ac­count to pay MediShield Life pre­mi­ums? Are there any grant schemes I can ap­ply for? Can my fam­ily mem­bers top up my Medis­ave for me?</p>
    <p>A Money can be de­ducted from the Medis­ave ac­counts of your im­me­di­ate fam­ily mem­bers, in­clud­ing your spouse or chil­dren, to pay pre­mi­ums on your be­half. You can also top up your Medis­ave ac­count with cash.</p>
    <p>There are pre­mium sub­si­dies avail­able for in­di­vid­u­als from lower- to mid­dle-in­come house­holds, mean­ing those with a monthly in­come of $2,800 or less.</p>
    <p>Th­ese sub­si­dies ap­ply au­to­mat­i­cally and are higher for those who are older. Per­ma­nent res­i­dents also re­ceive th­ese sub­si­dies, but at half the amount for a Sin­ga­porean.</p>
    <p>Sub­si­dies are higher for Sin­ga­pore­ans from the Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion, and those from the Pioneer Gen­er­a­tion also qual­ify for ad­di­tional sub­si­dies. Both Merdeka and Pioneer Gen­er­a­tion se­niors also re­ceive an­nual Medis­ave top­ups of $200 to $800, which can be used to pay for the pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients who have lim­ited fam­ily sup­port and still need help pay­ing their pre­mi­ums even after sub­si­dies can ap­ply for the Ad­di­tional Pre­mium Sup­port scheme.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry has said that even with the in­crease in pre­mi­ums, a typ­i­cal house­hold’s to­tal pre­mium after sub­si­dies is ex­pected to be within their an­nual Medis­ave con­tri­bu­tions and in­flows. No one will lose MediShield Life cover­age due to fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong has said.</p>
    <p>Q When do the higher pre­mi­ums kick in?</p>
    <p>A The council has rec­om­mended that an­nual pre­mi­ums be i ncreased by 11.5 per cent to 35.4 per cent, or be­tween $15 and $525 a year, de­pend­ing on the pa­tient’s age. The changes are ex­pected to be im­ple­mented early next year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a one-off Covid-19 sub­sidy for Sin­ga­pore­ans will help cush­ion this in­crease for the first two years. This will cover 70 per cent of the in­crease next year after other sub­si­dies are taken into ac­count, and 30 per cent of the in­crease in 2022.</p>
    <p>This means Sin­ga­pore­ans can ex­pect to pay about 10 per cent more in pre­mi­ums next year, com­pared with this year.</p>
