    <p>Be­liev­ers in the hu­man­is­ing role of lit­er­a­ture will be heart­ened by the re­sults of a new Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion sur­vey. It shows that the sub­ject ex­tends be­yond canon­i­cal tra­di­tions, and is of rel­e­vance in the real world. The sur­vey ex­am­ined teach­ers’ be­liefs to­wards lit­er­a­ture ed­u­ca­tion and their teach­ing prac­tices, even as a re­vised syl­labus for the sub­ject took ef­fect last year. The sur­vey of 232 lit­er­a­ture teach­ers from 47 sec­ondary schools is the first of its kind.</p>
    <p>The re­sults of the sur­vey reaf­firm the role of the hu­man­i­ties in gen­eral, and lit­er­a­ture in par­tic­u­lar, in the progress of civil­i­sa­tion. Lit­er­a­ture, like life it­self, is a prod­uct of dif­fer­ences. Dif­fer­ent plots, dif­fer­ent char­ac­ters, dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives and dif­fer­ent de­noue­ments on the page or the screen re­flect the un­pre­dictable but un­avoid­able con­tours of change in human life.</p>
    <p>A con­tem­po­rary ex­am­ple would be the coro­n­avirus pandemic. Covid-19 has changed many of the so­cial and eco­nomic par­a­digms that were taken for granted be­fore its ar­rival. A new world is in the mak­ing, but it can be bet­ter grasped only if old habits of thought and ac­tion change. When great nov­els, plays and po­ems are writ­ten on this ter­ri­ble episode in human af­fairs, they will help peo­ple to in­ter­pret the world from new and dif­fer­ent points of view: those of the el­derly, the young, stricken work­ers in all coun­tries, farm­ers and daily-wage labour­ers in many na­tions, and women who buf­fer their fam­i­lies from the vi­cis­si­tudes of calami­tous change.</p>
    <p>The lit­er­a­ture of the coro­n­avi­ral age will help the young of the fu­ture to nav­i­gate their way through chal­lenges that are un­known to­day. The great texts of yes­ter­day and to­day, whether penned in the West or the East, force the young and old to en­gage dif­fer­ence glob­ally. Sin­ga­pore stu­dents de­serve to ben­e­fit from the last­ing legacy of lit­er­a­ture as they find their place in the world.</p>
