    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic may have forced Sin­ga­pore­ans to iso­late them­selves at home and keep a safe dis­tance from one an­other, but it has also united the com­mu­nity in un­prece­dented ways, ac­cord­ing to a re­port which takes stock of how the pub­lic sec­tor and Sin­ga­pore have fared in ar­eas of na­tional in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic may have forced Sin­ga­pore­ans to iso­late them­selves at home and keep a safe dis­tance from one an­other, but it has also united the com­mu­nity in un­prece­dented ways, said a re­port on how Sin­ga­pore has fared in var­i­ous ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Since the coronaviru­s hit Sin­ga­pore’s shores in Jan­uary, in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses have joined hands with pub­lic agen­cies to help those af­fected by the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>This part­ner­ship be­tween the Govern­ment and the peo­ple has been a bright spot amid the gloom, with head of the civil ser­vice Leo Yip say­ing yes­ter­day: “It high­lights Sin­ga­pore­ans’ strong spirit of care and con­cern for one an­other as well as how work­ing to­gether has en­abled us to serve those in need and over­come this cri­sis as one.”</p>
    <p>The bi­en­nial Sin­ga­pore Pub­lic Sec­tor Out­comes Re­view re­port takes stock of how the pub­lic sec­tor and Sin­ga­pore have fared in ar­eas of na­tional in­ter­est. The lat­est re­port high­lighted a num­ber of key themes, among them Sin­ga­pore’s re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sta­tis­tics show that calls for vol­un­teers and do­na­tions were met with over­whelm­ing re­sponse, with peo­ple not just pitch­ing in for na­tional ef­forts, but also start­ing spon­ta­neous ini­tia­tives of their own.</p>
    <p>The re­port said na­tional con­tact trac­ing pro­gramme TraceTo­gether now cov­ers more than 50 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, with more than 2.9 mil­lion app and to­ken users as at this month. How­ever, this re</p>
    <p>mains short of the 70 per cent takeup rate that is one of three pre­con­di­tions for Sin­ga­pore to en­ter phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>Some cam­paigns like mask col­lec­tion drives at­tracted 28,000 grass­roots, pub­lic ser­vice and cit­i­zen vol­un­teers who manned booths at com­mu­nity cen­tres and</p>
    <p>did de­liv­ery runs to give out 13.2 mil­lion masks.</p>
    <p>More than 500 pri­vate-hire car and taxi driv­ers vol­un­teered to drive peo­ple who were sus­pected of hav­ing Covid-19, but were clin­i­cally well, to hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>De­spite fears of how in­fec­tious the coronaviru­s can be, hun­dreds</p>
    <p>of gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clin­ics also joined the Pub­lic Health Pre­pared­ness Clinic scheme to pro­vide sub­sidised treat­ment to those with res­pi­ra­tory symp­toms and iden­tify those with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>These Govern­ment-led ef­forts were aug­mented by spon­ta­neous ini­tia­tives of reg­u­lar Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>ans and busi­nesses big and small. Some or­gan­ised move­ments to show their appreciati­on for front­line work­ers, while oth­ers do­nated care packs and food to vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>In all, more than 13,000 Sin­ga­pore­ans signed up as vol­un­teers through the SGUnited por­tal set up for those who wanted to con­trib­ute, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>And de­spite the economic fall­out from the pan­demic, $90 mil­lion was do­nated to the Com­mu­nity Ch­est, the Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s Sayang Sayang Fund, as well as through the SG Cares app and Giv­ing.sg from Jan­uary to May – al­most as much as the do­na­tions re­ceived for the whole of last year by the Com­mu­nity Ch­est and Giv­ing.sg.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tive effort comes on top of the nearly $100 bil­lion set aside in the four bud­gets to help busi­nesses, save jobs, sup­port work­ers and strengthen so­cial and economic re­silience.</p>
    <p>Un­like past re­ports, this year’s re­port has a spe­cial sec­tion, en­ti­tled “Emerg­ing Stronger as One”, that is de­voted to recog­nis­ing this part­ner­ship be­tween the Govern­ment and peo­ple in the fight against the coronaviru­s, Mr Yip noted.</p>
    <p>“Whether in cri­sis or in nor­malcy, the pub­lic ser­vice will con­tinue to strive for bet­ter out­comes for our cit­i­zens and our busi­nesses. We will con­tinue to part­ner with Sin­ga­pore­ans to build a bet­ter fu­ture Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety and econ­omy, and to emerge stronger from this cri­sis,” he added.</p>
    <p>As Sin­ga­pore strives to over­come the chal­lenges in the post-Covid world, this part­ner­ship is even more crit­i­cal, said the re­port, adding that it is in line with the Sin­ga­pore To­gether move­ment, which was started to give Sin­ga­pore­ans a big­ger say in pol­i­cy­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>Through the Sin­ga­pore To­gether move­ment, more than 20 rep­re­sen­ta­tives of small busi­nesses, as­so­ci­a­tions, and land­lord and ten­ant groups con­trib­uted to the de­vel­op­ment of the Rental Re­lief Frame­work, which was in­tro­duced as part of the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Amend­ment Bill.</p>
    <p>Their views on the dif­fi­cul­ties busi­nesses faced and the im­pact of the pro­posed mea­sures were used to re­fine the re­lief mea­sures. With the help of con­tract law ex­perts from the pri­vate sec­tor, the Bill was in­tro­duced in 21 days, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day: “This Sin­ga­poreTo­gether spirit has united us through this cri­sis of a gen­er­a­tion. We still have much to do in our road to re­cov­ery. Let us con­tinue to work in close part­ner­ship, and emerge even stronger as one peo­ple.”</p>
