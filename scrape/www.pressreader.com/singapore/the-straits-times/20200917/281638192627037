    <p>Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said yes­ter­day that he would make a min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment on the case in­volv­ing for­mer maid Parti Liyani, who was re­cently ac­quit­ted of theft.</p>
    <p>It would be good for Par­lia­ment to dis­cuss the mat­ter, he told re­porters at a Home Team event.</p>
    <p>His com­ments came hours after sev­eral MPs, in­clud­ing Work­ers’ Party (WP) chair­man Sylvia Lim, said they have filed ques­tions as well as an ad­journ­ment mo­tion on the case for Par­lia­ment to de­bate at its next sit­ting, which is sched­uled to take place next month.</p>
    <p>The crim­i­nal case, in which the fam­ily of prom­i­nent busi­ness­man Liew Mun Leong ac­cused Ms Parti of steal­ing items worth a to­tal $34,000, has sparked an up­roar and raised ques­tions about the jus­tice sys­tem’s treat­ment of peo­ple who are less well-off.</p>
    <p>Mr Liew, 74, has since stepped down as chair­man of Changi Air­port Group and Sur­bana Jurong. He also re­signed from his po­si­tions as se­nior in­ter­na­tional busi­ness ad­viser at Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek and as a board mem­ber of Te­masek Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Shan­mugam, re­ply­ing to re­porters’ ques­tions at the event held at Tuas View Fire Sta­tion, said it will be good to “openly set out what hap­pened and deal with the ques­tions”.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, the WP said in a state­ment that Ms Lim, an MP for Alju­nied GRC, has filed an ad­journ­ment mo­tion ti­tled “Jus­tice for all: En­hanc­ing eq­uity in the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem”.</p>
    <p>It added that the mo­tion will re­fer to the deeper is­sues raised by Ms Parti’s case: “The in­ten­tion is to dis­cuss as­pects of the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem and the chal­lenges faced by per­sons of less means in nav­i­gat­ing it. Spe­cific sug­ges­tions to im­prove the sys­tem will be made.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is at least one other ad­journ­ment mo­tion on a sep­a­rate is­sue, and who will speak at the par­lia­men­tary sit­ting will be de­ter­mined by bal­lot.</p>
    <p>Ms Denise Phua, an MP for Jalan Be­sar GRC, said yes­ter­day on Face­book that she has filed an ad­journ­ment mo­tion to speak on the topic “Towards full par­tic­i­pa­tion of per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety”. Such a mo­tion al­lows an MP to speak for up to 20 min­utes on an is­sue.</p>
    <p>MPs who have filed ques­tions on Ms Parti’s case in­clude Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok), Mr Vikram Nair (Sem­bawang GRC) and Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC).</p>
    <p>Mr Mu­rali is ask­ing about what hap­pened in the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of the case, while Mr Nair wants to know what the Min­istry of Law’s in­ter­nal re­view has found about the han­dling of the mat­ter by the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said in his Face­book post that he has met Cle­menti res­i­dents “who felt deep dis­quiet” at what hap­pened in the case, adding that he has asked for sta­tis­tics on do­mes­tic work­ers ac­cused of theft.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, a 46-year-old In­done­sian, was last year sen­tenced to jail for two years and two months for steal­ing $34,000 worth of items from Mr Liew’s fam­ily, for whom she had worked for nine years.</p>
    <p>In over­turn­ing her con­vic­tion, High Court judge Chan Seng Onn, in his 100-page judg­ment, found the trial judge’s con­vic­tion of Ms Parti to be “un­safe” for var­i­ous rea­sons, in­clud­ing the way the po­lice han­dled the ev­i­dence and the mo­tive be­hind the al­le­ga­tions made by some mem­bers of the Liew fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said yes­ter­day it was good that both Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party and WP MPs “ap­pear to be very in­ter­ested” in the case.</p>
    <p>Last week, he said the au­thor­i­ties take very se­ri­ously Jus­tice Chan’s com­ments and would find out “what hap­pened, why it hap­pened and then deal with it”.</p>
