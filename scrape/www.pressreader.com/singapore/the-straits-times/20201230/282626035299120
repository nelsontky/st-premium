    <p>Ac­tor Alec Bald­win’s wife, Hi­laria Bald­win, has come un­der fire in re­cent days over ac­cu­sa­tions that she was fak­ing her Span­ish her­itage.</p>
    <p>In an In­sta­gram video on Sun­day, the yoga in­struc­tor clar­i­fied: “My fam­ily is white. Eth­ni­cally, I’m a mix of many, many, many things. Cul­tur­ally, I grew up with two cul­tures, so it’s re­ally as sim­ple as that.”</p>
    <p>Her post was a re­sponse to spec­u­la­tion on Twit­ter about her cul­tural roots.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter user @lenib­riscoe had sug­gested the star’s ac­cent and con­nec­tions to Spain were a ruse and pointed out that cer­tain ar­ti­cles sug­gested that Hi­laria Bald­win was born in Spain, de­spite her be­ing a Bos­ton na­tive.</p>
    <p>There were videos on­line i n which her Span­ish ac­cent seemed to vary and there were also claims that she of­ten went by the name Hil­lary, not Hi­laria, while grow­ing up in Bos­ton.</p>
    <p>In her video re­sponse, Hi­laria Bald­win noted that many of her fam­ily mem­bers live in Spain and em­pha­sised that the ac­cent was not some­thing she was “play­ing at”.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal Twit­ter thread, on the other hand, in­cluded in­for­ma­tion that sug­gested nei­ther of her par­ents were raised in Spain.</p>
    <p>Hours after his wife’s video went on­line, Alec Bald­win took to In­sta­gram to slam both Twit­ter trolls and tabloids and ad­mon­ished read­ers to “con­sider the source” when eval­u­at­ing a news story.</p>
    <p>Although the 30 Rock star did not specif­i­cally ad­dress the drama, he ex­plained that he wanted to share a video be­cause, “there are things that have been said lately about peo­ple that I love, that I care about deeply, which are just ridicu­lous”.</p>
    <p>A third Bald­win, Ire­land, joined in t he fray on Mon­day. The 25-year-old daugh­ter of Alec Bald­win and his for­mer wife Kim Basinger posted her sup­port for her step­mother on In­sta­gram Sto­ries.</p>
    <p>She said: “It’s so pa­thetic that any­one would want to play de­tec­tive and dig that deep into some­one’s life that they... don’t know any­thing about, don’t know how they were raised, who they were ac­tu­ally raised by.”</p>
    <p>She added: “I know who you are and I know what you are not and I’m lucky to know you for who you truly are.”</p>
