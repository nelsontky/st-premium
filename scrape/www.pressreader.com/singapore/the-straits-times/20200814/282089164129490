    <p>HONG KONG • Five decades ago, Swire Pa­cific was a found­ing mem­ber of Hong Kong’s bench­mark stock in­dex. Now the fam­ily-run group risks los­ing its mem­ber­ship as Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy firms in­crease their sway in the city’s eq­uity mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The con­glom­er­ate, which owns a 45 per cent stake in Cathay Pa­cific, also has busi­ness in­ter­ests span­ning sec­tors from prop­erty to trad­ing to off­shore.</p>
    <p>Its shares have taken a ham­mer­ing as last year’s protests in Hong Kong as well as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hurt its air­line busi­ness and re­tail and real es­tate op­er­a­tions. The stock has lost 43 per cent this year, the big­gest de­cline among the Hang Seng In­dex’s 50 con­stituents, re­duc­ing its mar­ket value to HK$58 bil­lion (S$10.3 bil­lion). That has made it the least valu­able mem­ber on the gauge.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion and turnover are among fac­tors the com­piler of the Hang Seng In­dex con­sid­ers when re­view­ing mem­ber­ship. The re­sults of the next re­view will be an­nounced after the mar­ket closes to­day. About US$30 bil­lion (S$41 bil­lion) in pen­sion fund as­sets and ex­change-traded funds track the in­dex.</p>
    <p>“Swire Pa­cific is one of the stocks that are likely to be ex­cluded from the Hang Seng In­dex,” said Mr Kenny Wen, a strate­gist with Ever­bright Sun Hung Kai. “Even if the prop­erty mar­ket out­look turns sta­ble, we don’t see any signs of re­cov­ery for its avi­a­tion and marine busi­nesses in the near term.”</p>
    <p>Swire Pa­cific de­clined to com­ment to Bloomberg News. The com­pany slumped to a first-half net loss of HK$7.74 bil­lion, mainly due to the im­pact of the pan­demic on Cathay Pa­cific Air­ways and sig­nif­i­cant im­pair­ment charges, it said in an earn­ings state­ment re­leased dur­ing yesterday’s mid­day trad­ing break.</p>
    <p>Ad­ding pres­sure is the flood of Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy firms list­ing in Hong Kong. Three such com­pa­nies – Alibaba Group Hold­ing, Meituan Dian­ping and Xiaomi – will be el­i­gi­ble to join the Hang Seng In­dex after its com­piler al­lowed firms car­ry­ing un­equal vot­ing rights and dual-class shares to join the bench­mark. The move is seen as a cru­cial up­date for a gauge over­stuffed with old econ­omy banks and in­sur­ers.</p>
    <p>HSBC Hold­ings, a found­ing mem­ber of the in­dex, is the sec­ond-worst per­former on the gauge this year with a 42 per cent loss. The bank faced crit­i­cism from the Chi­nese state me­dia over its deal­ings with Huawei Tech­nolo­gies, as well as from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion for its pub­lic sup­port of Hong Kong’s na­tional se­cu­rity law. The lender cur­rently has the third-largest weight­ing on the gauge.</p>
    <p>Along with Swire Pa­cific, other firms that face the risk of los­ing mem­ber­ship are Sino Land and CK In­fra­struc­ture Hold­ings, ow­ing to their rel­a­tively low free-float-ad­justed mar­ket cap and small trad­ing vol­ume, ac­cord­ing to CGS-CIMB an­a­lysts.</p>
