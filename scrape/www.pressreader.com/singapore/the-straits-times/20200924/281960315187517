    <p>•</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES Deadly blazes rag­ing across the west­ern US have again de­stroyed thou­sands of homes nes­tled in forested ar­eas this year – with months of the fire sea­son still to come in a re­gion per­ilously ex­posed to cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>With many in­sur­ers now re­fus­ing or charg­ing ex­or­bi­tant rates to cover at-risk houses, some home own­ers are ques­tion­ing what the fu­ture holds for their ex­hausted com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­la­tions of set­tle­ments built on the forested mar­gins of cities – of­fi­cially known as the wild­land-ur­ban in­ter­face (WUI) – have ex­ploded in re­cent decades, and now to­tal some 50 mil­lion house­holds.</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple is Par­adise, a town bor­der­ing north­ern California’s national forests, which was dev­as­tated by the state’s dead­li­est mod­ern-day fire in 2018.</p>
    <p>Re­build­ing from the in­ferno that claimed 86 lives had not even fin­ished when it was threat­ened by an­other fire burn­ing in a neigh­bour­ing town this month.</p>
    <p>De­spite the in­her­ent risk of liv­ing in set­tle­ments like Par­adise, the idea of evict­ing cit­i­zens “is the last so­lu­tion res­i­dents want to re­sort to and pol­i­cy­mak­ers want to re­sort to”, said Dr Gre­gory Pierce, an ur­ban plan­ning pro­fes­sor at the Univer­sity of California, Los An­ge­les. “But, for some com­mu­ni­ties, it’s the only an­swer for sur­vival.”</p>
    <p>So far this year, some 6,500 struc­tures have been de­stroyed in California, said the state’s Depart­ment of Forestry and Fire Pro­tec­tion, with mas­sive dev­as­ta­tion ex­tend­ing far into Ore­gon and Washington states up the Pa­cific coast­line.</p>
    <p>But WUI hous­ing has grown ex­po­nen­tially due to the re­gion’s “hous­ing af­ford­abil­ity cri­sis”, said Dr Pierce.</p>
    <p>California’s real es­tate is among the costli­est in the United States, but it is still “cheaper to build new de­vel­op­ment in out­ly­ing ar­eas than it is in core ur­ban ar­eas”.</p>
    <p>WUI hous­ing boomed na­tion­wide from 1990 to 2010, both in num­ber of new homes (41 per cent) and land area used (33 per cent), said the US For­est Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>There are many fac­tors be­hind California’s record fires. Be­sides over­pop­u­la­tion of the WUI, years of drought wors­ened by cli­mate change have left end­less hectares of ex­cess, dry vege­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>For Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, a cli­mate change scep­tic, poor for­est man­age­ment is the lead­ing cul­prit.</p>
    <p>One man­age­ment tac­tic is to de­lib­er­ately light “pre­scribed fires” that re­move the fuel that feeds wild­fires in a con­trolled way.</p>
    <p>“Plans and prac­tices like that can be very suc­cess­ful, but it’s very, very dif­fi­cult to do to­day be­cause of the fact that there are a lot of peo­ple liv­ing out there,” said re­tired California fire chief David Shew.</p>
    <p>An­other al­ter­na­tive would be to shift new hous­ing stock to less flammable ma­te­ri­als or re­model ex­ist­ing homes, he said.</p>
    <p>The re­mod­elling would be ex­pen­sive, but could make the vi­tal difference in sur­viv­ing the next in­ferno, he added – and be­sides, there is no other easy op­tion.</p>
    <p>“We’ll never have enough fire en­gines to park in ev­ery drive­way.”</p>
