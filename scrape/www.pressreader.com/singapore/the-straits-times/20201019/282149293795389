    <p>Mr Wong Jin Feng knew from a young age that his strength lies in num­bers, not words. He dis­cov­ered his pas­sion for ac­coun­tancy when pur­su­ing a diploma in the sub­ject at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic. Cit­ing pos­i­tive ex­pe­ri­ences from his polytech­nic days, the 29-year-old says learn­ing went be­yond tra­di­tional class­room-based teach­ing.</p>
    <p>“There was a fo­cus on ca­reer-build­ing,” he says. “It al­lowed me to un­der­stand the practical chal­lenges in the in­dus­try, and ex­posed me to the var­i­ous types of jobs that ac­coun­tancy can of­fer.”</p>
    <p>He went on to pur­sue two dif­fer­ent part-time pro­grammes. Upon grad­u­a­tion, he took up the As­so­ci­a­tion of Char­tered Cer­ti­fied Ac­coun­tants (ACCA) Qual­i­fi­ca­tion, while com­plet­ing his na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>This pro­fes­sional ac­count­ing qual­i­fi­ca­tion is recog­nised world­wide, al­low­ing him to quickly grow his pro­fes­sional knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter, he went on to com­plete his Master of Sci­ence (MSc) in Pro­fes­sional Ac­coun­tancy un­der the Univer­sity of Lon­don (UOL), an in­no­va­tive part­ner­ship be­tween the ACCA and UOL, while work­ing in his first full-time job.</p>
    <p>Build­ing tech­ni­cal and strate­gic skills</p>
    <p>The ACCA Qual­i­fi­ca­tion has helped him gain a more in-depth un­der­stand­ing of top­ics such as cor­po­rate and busi­ness law, per­for­mance man­age­ment, tax­a­tion, fi­nan­cial re­port­ing, au­dit and fi­nan­cial man­age­ment, while the Master of Sci­ence in Pro­fes­sional Ac­coun­tancy pro­gramme strength­ened his aca­demic un­der­stand­ing across dif­fer­ent as­pects of ac­count­ing.</p>
    <p>“The qual­i­fi­ca­tions are com­ple­men­tary, and at­tain­ing both was a value-add,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong re­calls how it was not easy jug­gling a full-time job with his stud­ies. Hav­ing a clear end goal from the be­gin­ning helped him to power through.</p>
    <p>“I stud­ied hard and man­aged to pass all ACCA ex­ams in my first at­tempt,” he says.</p>
    <p>His ef­forts paid off when he was given greater re­spon­si­bil­i­ties at work where he man­aged the port­fo­lio of one of the toplisted com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Today, Mr Wong is a Pro­fes­sional Prod­ucts Di­vi­sion (PPD) busi­ness con­troller at L’Oreal Sin­ga­pore, where he works closely with col­leagues from other busi­ness func­tions to op­ti­mise in­vest­ments and drive prof­itabil­ity.</p>
    <p>He cred­its both ed­u­ca­tion path­ways for giv­ing him the tech­ni­cal and strate­gic skill sets to ex­cel in his ca­reer today. He plans to take up pro­grammes fo­cus­ing on fi­nance in­no­va­tion and tech­nol­ogy in the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>To as­pir­ing ac­coun­tants who want to ad­vance their ca­reers, his ad­vice is now is a good time to up­skill, and one way to do so is to take up pro­grammes with ACCA .</p>
    <p>“It’s not just a pa­per qual­i­fi­ca­tion,” he ex­plains. “ACCA pub­lishes re­search, and holds reg­u­lar con­fer­ences and net­work­ing events to al­low ac­coun­tants to con­tinue to stay rel­e­vant.”</p>
