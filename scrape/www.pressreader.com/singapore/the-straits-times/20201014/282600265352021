    <p>LON­DON • Mar­garet Nolan, a stage and screen ac­tress whose gold­painted body was used as a can­vas to pro­ject the open­ing cred­its of the James Bond film Goldfin­ger (1964) and who played the char­ac­ter Dink in the movie, has died. She was 76.</p>
    <p>She died last Mon­day at her home in Belfast Park, Lon­don. The cause of death was can­cer, said her son Oscar Deeks, who con­firmed her death.</p>
    <p>In a ca­reer that was pre­dom­i­nantly in the 1960s and 1970s, Nolan ap­peared in nu­mer­ous BBC tele­vi­sion pro­duc­tions and in films, in­clud­ing No Sex Please, We’re Bri­tish (1973) and Carry On Girls (1973).</p>
    <p>She also ap­peared in A Hard Day’s Night (1964), the mu­si­cal com­edy fea­tur­ing The Bea­tles. She ap­peared in an un­cred­ited role as “Grand­fa­ther’s Girl at Casino”.</p>
    <p>But it was the open­ing ti­tle se­quence of Goldfin­ger, which was pro­jected onto Nolan’s body as if it were a screen, that brought her fame.</p>
    <p>In an archived ver­sion of her of­fi­cial web­site, Nolan de­scribed how she was “quite un­ex­pect­edly shot i nto the lime­light” by the movie when she was only 20.</p>
    <p>The film-mak­ers wanted her to be the body for the ti­tle se­quence, but she agreed to do it only if she were given a role in the movie. She ended up play­ing a masseuse named Dink who ap­pears briefly with James Bond, played by ac­tor Sean Con­nery.</p>
    <p>Nolan’s char­ac­ter in Goldfin­ger was not to be con­fused with the char­ac­ter who is com­pletely painted in gold and dies of “skin suf­fo­ca­tion”. That char­ac­ter, Jill Master­son, was played by ac­tress Shirley Ea­ton.</p>
    <p>Nolan turned down a two-year con­tract to pub­li­cise the film be­cause she said she would find it dif­fi­cult to live down such at­ten­tion and wanted to be taken se­ri­ously as an ac­tress.</p>
    <p>“As it tran­spired, I couldn’t ‘live it down’ any­way and, to this day, get reg­u­lar fan mail from Bond fans,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>Nolan gave up act­ing in the late 1980s to fo­cus on home­mak­ing and car­ing for her two sons, Deeks and Luke O’Sul­li­van.</p>
    <p>Her first mar­riage to play­wright Tom Kempin­ski ended in di­vorce, as did her sec­ond mar­riage to Mike O’Sul­li­van. She is also sur­vived by a sis­ter, Geral­dine Ross.</p>
