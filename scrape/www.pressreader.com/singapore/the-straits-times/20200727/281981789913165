    <p>The Boe­ing 747 took another step to­wards re­tire­ment this month. Bri­tish Air­ways, the op­er­a­tor of the largest fleet of pas­sen­ger 747s, an­nounced that the dis­tinc­tive aero­plane would not be re­turn­ing to ser­vice af­ter the pan­demic. For all the right­ful con­cern about the en­vi­ron­men­tal cost of long-haul travel, the plane will be missed by pas­sen­gers and pi­lots alike.</p>
    <p>Mark Van­hoe­nacker, pi­lot and writer, de­scribes the plane as “370 tonnes of avi­a­tion leg­end”. The first time I rode on the top deck of a 747, my own ex­cite­ment was more child­like – but still surely jus­ti­fied. Mod­i­fied 747s car­ried the Space Shut­tle around on their backs, and have served as the of­fi­cial plane for United States pres­i­dents since the time of Ge­orge H.W. Bush. It is an iconic de­sign.</p>
    <p>But what is of­ten over­looked is the sheer longevity of the 747. The plane first flew be­fore the 1969 moon land­ing, and the Bri­tish Air­ways an­nounce­ment is hardly the end.</p>
    <p>The travel down­turn caused by the coronaviru­s may have ac­cel­er­ated its phas­ing out but new 747s are still be­ing made as freight hauliers. That may soon stop but to­day’s planes are likely to still be flying in 2040 – and per­haps the 747 will even fly as an oc­to­ge­nar­ian in 2050.</p>
    <p>We are used to re­plac­ing lap­tops af­ter three or four years, and phones even more fre­quently. A com­puter first used in 1969 would be a mu­seum piece now. Yet many tech­nolo­gies last much longer, as another mu­seum piece at­tests. Lon­don’s Sci­ence Mu­seum boasts a vast red steam en­gine that one might as­sume dated to the In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion. In fact, it was built in the 20th cen­tury and pow­ered a Lan­cashire cot­ton mill well into the space age.</p>
    <p>As David Edger­ton ar­gues in his splen­did book, we per­sis­tently con­flate the tech­no­log­i­cal fron­tier with the work­horse tech­nolo­gies we ac­tu­ally use.</p>
    <p>Long af­ter the cut­ting edge of war­fare seemed to be tanks and aero­planes, horses re­mained a mil­i­tary es­sen­tial. The German Wehrma­cht be­gan World War II with more than 500,000 horses and dou­bled that num­ber by 1945. Work­horse tech­nolo­gies in­deed.</p>
    <p>Old tech­nolo­gies re­main rel­e­vant for sev­eral rea­sons. Some­times they work as well as any­thing newer. For their in­tended pur­poses, bricks, con­doms, forks, pa­per and ship­ping con­tain­ers are all hard to beat. Old tools can long thrive along­side newer tricks.</p>
    <p>Even once an ap­proach seems thor­oughly ob­so­lete, it can be cat­a­pulted back to the tech­no­log­i­cal fron­tier. Elec­tric cars may be the ve­hi­cles of the fu­ture, but they are the ve­hi­cles of the past, too: The first land speed record, of nearly 64km an hour, was set in 1898 in an elec­tric car.</p>
    <p>The cut­ting edge can also be pro­hib­i­tively ex­pen­sive. Con­corde, a plane of sim­i­lar vin­tage to the Boe­ing 747, was a tech­no­log­i­cal mir­a­cle – and a com­mer­cial catas­tro­phe.</p>
    <p>Even in­ven­tions that are eco­nom­i­cally vi­able for some may not reach ev­ery­one. Pro­fes­sor Edger­ton notes that cars, planes and tele­vi­sion all spread rapidly around the world but not so rapidly from rich to poor. It may take a long time be­fore to­day’s hot new thing is avail­able to the typ­i­cal cit­i­zen of the planet. In­deed, as with Con­corde, that tech­no­log­i­cal trickle-down may never hap­pen.</p>
    <p>A tech­nol­ogy may also thrive be­cause it of­fers ad­van­tages that the sup­pos­edly su­pe­rior ap­proach does not. A phone call is a lot cheaper and faster than a transat­lantic flight. And while I ride a bike most days, that is not be­cause I can­not af­ford a car: It is be­cause in a city the bike is fun to ride, ef­fort­less to park and a much faster way to get around.</p>
    <p>It seems that I am not alone. Glob­ally, bi­cy­cle pro­duc­tion has ex­ceeded car pro­duc­tion for decades. Yet thanks to pan­demic-in­duced de­mand, there is now a world­wide short­age of bikes. If self-driv­ing elec­tric cars catch on, cy­clists may flour­ish fur­ther on safer streets. Con­sci­en­tious ro­bots driv­ing zero-emis­sion ve­hi­cles beat er­ratic hu­mans driv­ing diesel cars.</p>
    <p>One rea­son all this mat­ters is that old tech­nol­ogy adds in­er­tia to our eco­nomic sys­tem.</p>
    <p>If we want to take ac­tion on cli­mate change – and I some­times de­spair­ingly won­der if that is true – then we must recog­nise how long it takes to change the old way of do­ing things.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is some­times de­scribed as “car­bon lock-in”, as the typ­i­cal house, or car, or power gen­er­a­tor, falls far short of the clean­est, most ef­fi­cient op­tion. This is not just about clean en­ergy: From vac­cines to the In­ter­net, it can take too long for ev­ery­one to gain ac­cess to the ben­e­fits of in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>But in the scram­ble to get to what is new, we shouldn’t over­look the value of what is old. Many cities are so per­fectly suited to bi­cy­cles, buses and trams that it is hard to un­der­stand quite why any­one let the cars into them in the first place. Per­haps we fell so in love with what was new that we for­got to ask whether it was also the best tech­nol­ogy we had.</p>
    <p>So, as we say a long good­bye to the 747, let’s think hard about what we choose to re­place it. No doubt that will partly be newer, fancier air­lin­ers. But let’s not for­get the long-dis­tance tele­phone call: 105 years old and still go­ing strong.</p>
