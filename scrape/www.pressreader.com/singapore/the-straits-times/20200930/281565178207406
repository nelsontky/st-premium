    <p>The Miche­lin Guide has can­celled its se­lec­tion of star-stud­ded restau­rants here for this year ow­ing to the long pe­riod of clo­sure of restau­rants in Sin­ga­pore dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis. In a state­ment yesterday, it said the in­spec­tion pe­riod has been ex­tended as the guide’s in­spec­tors re­turn to dine “with cau­tious plea­sure”.</p>
    <p>The Miche­lin Guide has can­celled its se­lec­tion of starstud­ded restau­rants for this year due to the long pe­riod of clo­sure of restau­rants in the coun­try be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment sent to me­dia yesterday, it said that the in­spec­tion pe­riod has been ex­tended as the guide’s in­spec­tors – who had vis­ited restau­rants be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic – are re­turn­ing to dine “with cau­tious plea­sure”.</p>
    <p>One of the cri­te­ria for as­sess­ing restau­rants is “con­sis­tency be­tween vis­its”. In­spec­tors were un­able to eval­u­ate this as restau­rants were closed for about 11 weeks, and din­ing in was not al­lowed un­til June 19.</p>
    <p>“Although we’ve been im­pressed to ob­serve how the chefs and their teams were able to re-in­vent their ac­tiv­ity and to de­velop take­aways or de­liv­ery con­cepts, our pol­icy is to eval­u­ate din­ing-in ex­pe­ri­ences,” said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Other judg­ing cri­te­ria in­clude qual­ity of the prod­ucts, mas­tery of flavour and cook­ing tech­niques, and the per­son­al­ity of the chef in his or her cui­sine.</p>
    <p>It added: “Un­der no cir­cum­stances will there be any ques­tion of sanc­tion­ing an es­tab­lish­ment in this par­tic­u­lar eco­nomic and health cli­mate and we will do ev­ery­thing pos­si­ble in terms of hu­man and tech­no­log­i­cal en­gage­ment to high­light the dy­namism of in­ter­na­tional culi­nary scenes, as we have been do­ing for over 120 years.”</p>
    <p>Once its in­spec­tors have con­ducted suf­fi­cient checks on the restau­rants, the guide will an­nounce “in the up­com­ing months” its 2021 se­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Miche­lin Guide started in 2016 and has been an an­nual af­fair fea­tur­ing a gala din­ner and award cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Last year’s event, held at Capella Sin­ga­pore, saw 44 eater­ies bag­ging Miche­lin stars. French fine-din­ing restau­rants Odette and Les Amis re­ceived the max­i­mum of three Miche­lin stars each – “for ex­cep­tional cui­sine that is worth a spe­cial jour­ney”.</p>
    <p>Not all edi­tions of the Miche­lin Guide have been can­celled. Tai­wan’s 2020 guide was launched last month, while Guangzhou’s was re­leased 10 days ago.</p>
