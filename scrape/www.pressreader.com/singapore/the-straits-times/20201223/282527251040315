    <p>LON­DON Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer hopes to get his hands on the League Cup so that it will serve as a step­ping stone to win­ning more tro­phies in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Since be­ing ap­pointed in De­cem­ber 2018, the Red Devils have come close to win­ning sil­ver­ware, reach­ing the semi-fi­nals of the League Cup, FA Cup and the Eu­ropa League last sea­son.</p>
    <p>The 2016-17 sea­son when United won the dou­ble of the League Cup and Eu­ropa League re­mains the last time the club tasted suc­cess and with Sol­sk­jaer also yet to lift a ma­jor tro­phy in Eng­land as a man­ager, he is ea­ger to bring back the glory days to Old Traf­ford.</p>
    <p>“We are des­per­ate to get our hands on a tro­phy, these play­ers are des­per­ate to learn how to win,” he told re­porters at his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence ahead of to­day’s League Cup quar­ter-fi­nal at Ever­ton.</p>
    <p>“We want to im­prove ev­ery sea­son and to im­prove on last year is to get to the fi­nal and, of course, when you get to the fi­nal, there’s only one thing that mat­ters and that’s to lift the tro­phy.”</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing how some of the club’s re­cent greats found suc­cess af­ter first lift­ing the League Cup in 2006, he said: “I re­mem­ber win­ning my first tro­phy (the 1996-97 Premier League ti­tle).</p>
    <p>“Even to­wards the end of my ca­reer, I think it was Pa­trice Evra and Ne­manja Vidic’s first tro­phy in the (2006) Car­ling Cup. I think that was their first tro­phy and it does give some­thing to a team.”</p>
    <p>But with an ar­guably more im­por­tant top-flight game com­ing just three days later at Le­ices­ter, where United can leapfrog their op­po­nents into sec­ond place with a vic­tory, Sol­sk­jaer will have to shuf­fle the pack.</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian will bring back Ma­son Green­wood, who was left on the bench dur­ing their 6-2 rout of Leeds on Sun­day, while Jesse Lin­gard will re­turn to the squad for the first time since Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old has only fea­tured twice in the League Cup this sea­son as he has re­port­edly been out of favour on top of be­ing forced to self-iso­late af­ter com­ing into close con­tact with those who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Sol­sk­jaer will give Lin­gard a chance at Good­i­son Park, say­ing: “He’s been work­ing hard in train­ing. He’s been un­for­tu­nate with hav­ing to iso­late a few times, been in con­tact, or close con­tact with Covid, not even hav­ing it him­self. He’s been very un­lucky be­ing away from the train­ing ground a few times... he’ll be in­volved in the squad, def­i­nitely, on Wed­nes­day.”</p>
    <p>While United’s tro­phy drought goes back three years, it has been 25 years since Ever­ton last claimed sil­ver­ware.</p>
    <p>Long starved of suc­cess, Tof­fees man­ager Carlo Ancelotti vowed to field his strong­est pos­si­ble side. James Ro­driguez, Al­lan, Lu­cas Digne, Jean-Philippe Gbamin, An­dre Gomes and Fabian Delph are all out but their ab­sen­tee list has not de­railed their push in the league, sit­ting in fourth be­low United only on goal dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing his team to carry over their form into the League Cup, Ancelotti said yes­ter­day: “We give a lot of im­por­tance to this com­pe­ti­tion. Ever­ton never won it. We are two games from the fi­nal so it would be fan­tas­tic to play a fi­nal if pos­si­ble.”</p>
