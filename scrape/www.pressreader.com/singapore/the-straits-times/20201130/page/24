While its symptoms typically show up in older people, it's not uncommon for youngsters to show signs of wear and tear in their cartilage. Who doesn’t love a good snack? Even though snacking has gained a bad reputation, snacks can be an important part of your diet. For a start, healthy snacks can help to replenish energy between meals or after a workout. Estalife™ ProJoint is uniquely formulated with natural ingredient­s to help replenish nutrients the body needs to promote healthy joints, and give extra support and protection to these connecting areas. And if you often find yourself in the snack aisle, you probably would have noticed that the shelves are stocked with many brands and varieties of chocolates. One of them is Ghirardell­i’s dark chocolate and milk chocolate melting wafers, two irresistib­le choices to add to your shopping list. They serve as ideal ingredient­s for baking, chocolate dips and chocolate fondue. Made in Japan, this formula contains ingredient­s such as Undenature­d Type II Collagen and Red Ginger Extract which can support cartilage synthesis and promote better joint flexibilit­y and mobility. Intensifie­d with Xpert Nutri-Joint™, the complete formula further supplement­s joint structure and cartilage, relieving one from aches or discomfort that may arise. If you prefer beverages, then Wild Tonic’s Raw Jun Kombucha could be your cup of tea. Jun is a cousin of traditiona­l Kombucha and is made with honey instead of cane sugar. It is not only smoother and lighter, but also tosses out the strong vinegar aftertaste commonly found in Kombucha.

Its different flavours include POKKA Houjicha Japanese Roasted Tea, Oolong Tea, Sencha Japanese Tea and Jasmine Green Tea. The selection offers customers a chance to indulge in their favourite beverage with a tinge less guilt. POKKA No Sugar Tea also serves as an appetizing alternativ­e to plain water.
