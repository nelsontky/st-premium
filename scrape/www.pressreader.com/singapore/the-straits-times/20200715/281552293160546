    <p>Hun­dreds of fire­fight­ers bat­tled for a sec­ond day to save a United States war­ship swept by flames at a San Diego ship­yard, with the num­ber of in­jured in the blaze ris­ing to 60. The fire on the USS Bon­homme Richard erupted on Sun­day morn­ing in the lower cargo hold of the ship and spread through much of the ves­sel. WORLD</p>
    <p>SAN DIEGO • Hun­dreds of fire­fight­ers bat­tled through a sec­ond day from the air, land and wa­ter to save a US war ves­sel swept by flames while moored at a San Diego ship­yard, as the num­ber of sailors and civil­ians in­jured in the blaze rose to nearly 60.</p>
    <p>The USS Bon­homme Richard, an am­phibi­ous as­sault ship whose size ranks sec­ond in the US Navy fleet to that of an air­craft car­rier, re­mained largely shrouded in thick, acrid smoke on Mon­day as the ves­sel be­gan list­ing to its star­board side.</p>
    <p>The fire, ac­com­pa­nied by at least one large ex­plo­sion, erupted on Sun­day morn­ing in the lower cargo hold of the 257m ship, docked for rou­tine main­te­nance at its home port at US Naval Base San Diego.</p>
    <p>Since then, flames have spread through­out much of the ship and up into the tower and other struc­tures on the top of the ves­sel, Rear-Ad­mi­ral Philip Sobeck told a news con­fer­ence on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Be­cause it was un­der­go­ing re­pairs at the time, only about 160 of the ship’s usual con­tin­gent of 1,000 crew mem­bers were aboard at the time and all ma­jor mu­ni­tions had al­ready been re­moved from the ves­sel as a stan­dard safety prac­tice,</p>
    <p>Navy of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>He­li­copters dropped wa­ter over the ship through­out Mon­day while fire boats on the perime­ter streamed wa­ter on the hull to cool it from the out­side.</p>
    <p>San Diego fire crews dis­con­tin­ued blast­ing wa­ter into the ship from shore, ap­par­ently out of con­cern over desta­bil­is­ing the ves­sel’s buoy­ancy.</p>
    <p>Asked whether the ship might be razed be­yond re­pair, Rear-Adm Sobeck said he was “hope­ful” it could be spared. “Once we get the fire out, which is our pri­or­ity, then we’ll make that as­sess­ment.”</p>
    <p>The fire’s cause was un­known, but a Navy spokesman said there was no ev­i­dence of foul play. The Navy said 36 sailors and 23 civil­ians had been treated for mi­nor in­juries, in­clud­ing heat ex­haus­tion and smoke in­hala­tion, and no per­son­nel re­mained hos­pi­talised.</p>
    <p>The Bon­homme Richard, com­mis­sioned in 1998, is de­signed to carry US Marine Corps at­tack he­li­copters and ground troops into bat­tle.</p>
