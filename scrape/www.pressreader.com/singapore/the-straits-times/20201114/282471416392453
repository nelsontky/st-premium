    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain knows Christ­mas is com­ing when John Lewis Part­ner­ship launches its tele­vi­sion ad. Sell­ing the sea­son as a time for acts of char­ity rather than any par­tic­u­lar prod­uct, this year’s edi­tion will fo­cus on food poverty and strug­gling par­ents.</p>
    <p>Yet as the coro­n­avirus con­tin­ues to wreak havoc, it is the de­part­ment store chain it­self that is now a win­dow on the fes­tive pe­riod in a coun­try that re­lies more on con­sumer spend­ing than any of the big Euro­pean economies.</p>
    <p>With a par­tial lock­down in Eng­land clos­ing all non-essen­tial stores un­til at least Dec 2, res­cu­ing the next six weeks from Covid-19 is crit­i­cal for Bri­tain’s fi­nan­cial well­be­ing and a gov­ern­ment be­set by ac­cu­sa­tions that it can­not get a grip on the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther dis­rup­tion to what re­tail­ers call the “golden quar­ter” could be dis­as­trous for an in­dus­try that has al­ready been bat­tered. Novem­ber and De­cem­ber ac­count for one of ev­ery £5 of re­tail spend­ing.</p>
    <p>The slump dur­ing Bri­tain’s spring lock­down pre­cip­i­tated the record de­cline in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct. It then con­trib­uted to most of the re­cov­ery in the third quar­ter re­ported by the Of­fice for Na­tional Sta­tis­tics on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The lat­est lock­down could cost re­tail­ers about £9 bil­lion (S$15.9 bil­lion), mak­ing what hap­pens next month all the more im­por­tant, said Mr Kyle Monk, di­rec­tor of in­sight at the Bri­tish Re­tail Con­sor­tium, or BRC. House­hold spend­ing in­creases by 25 per cent as Christ­mas comes. “If De­cem­ber is spent in lock­down, it would be pretty catas­trophic,” Mr Monk said.</p>
    <p>As lights and dec­o­ra­tions start to go up on shop­ping streets, no re­tailer knows the im­por­tance of Christ­mas more than John Lewis, the store of choice for many mid­dle-class Bri­tons. Last year, about 14 per cent of the part­ner­ship’s an­nual sales came in the last five weeks of the year.</p>
    <p>This year mat­ters more than most for a 91-year-old com­pany that is a mi­cro­cosm of the econ­omy’s malaise, with job cuts, the</p>
    <p>ac­cel­er­ated shift to do­ing things on­line and the re­pur­pos­ing of staff and shops.</p>
    <p>John Lewis an­nounced plans last Wed­nes­day to cut as many as 1,500 jobs at its head of­fice, tak­ing the to­tal toll this year to just un­der 4 per cent of the work­force.</p>
    <p>Those cuts only add to the blood­let­ting on Bri­tain’s main streets, where close to 125,000 jobs were lost in just the first eight months of this year, ac­cord­ing to the Centre for Re­tail Re­search.</p>
    <p>Ms Sharon White, chair­man of John Lewis, said in Oc­to­ber when she re­vealed the part­ner­ship’s turn­around strat­egy that hard de­ci­sions were needed to ar­rest a de­cline in prof­itabil­ity at one of the coun­try’s big­gest pri­vate em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>She an­nounced the clo­sure of eight out of 50 stores, while per­mis­sion from the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties to con­vert nearly half of John Lewis’s flag­ship store on Lon­don’s Ox­ford Street into of­fices has been granted.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also can­celled an­nual bonuses this year. It is the first time in more than 70 years that its 78,000 staff who col­lec­tively own the part­ner­ship will re­ceive no pay­out.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to deal­ing with Covid-19, Bri­tain also faces the po­ten­tial cost of leav­ing Europe’s sin­gle mar­ket with­out a trade agree­ment in place. As Brexit talks drag on, re­tail­ers have had to acti</p>
    <p>vate con­tin­gency plans to try to mit­i­gate any ini­tial sup­ply chain prob­lems and dis­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>John Lewis said last year that it was pre­pared for a no-deal Brexit but warned it will have a “sig­nif­i­cant im­pact”, par­tic­u­larly on fresh food sup­plies at its Waitrose gro­cery chain. The BRC said the in­dus­try would face £3 bil­lion of tar­iffs on food should Bri­tain and the Euro­pean Union fail to reach an ac­cord.</p>
    <p>But for now the at­ten­tion is on avoid­ing a bad Christ­mas. A Deloitte sur­vey last year found Bri­tish con­sumers were fore­cast to spend nearly 39 per cent more on av­er­age com­pared with shop­pers in the rest of Europe in the pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple un­der­es­ti­mate just how geared the de­part­ment store is to­wards the Christ­mas shop­ping pe­riod,” said Mr Ian Cheshire, chair­man of Bar­clays UK and for­mer chair­man of de­part­ment store group Deben­hams. “More than a year’s profit is ef­fec­tively made in that pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>John Lewis started its Christ­mas ads a lit­tle over a decade ago. This year’s pro­duc­tion, called “Give A Lit­tle Love”, started run­ning on so­cial me­dia yes­ter­day and will run on tele­vi­sion at the week­end.</p>
    <p>In a sign of the strug­gles faced by house­holds as well as re­tail­ers, it will in­clude a di­rect ap­peal to sup­port two char­i­ties help­ing peo­ple through the pan­demic.</p>
