    <p>The clock is run­ning down on the plan to re­cap­i­talise trou­bled off­shore and marine gi­ant Sem­b­corp Marine.</p>
    <p>It’s crunch time for share­hold­ers lead­ing up to the crit­i­cal vir­tual ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing (EGM) next Tues­day. They should all have re­ceived cir­cu­lars ask­ing them to sub­mit votes and ques­tions – via hard copy or elec­tron­i­cally – on whether to go ahead with the re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, share­hold­ers of Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries, which con­trols 61 per cent of Sem­bMarine, will have to vote to ap­prove a de­merger of the com­pany from it­self.</p>
    <p>Share­hold­ers of both com­pa­nies must sub­mit votes by Satur­day. Those whose shares are held in their Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund ac­counts will have to give in­struc­tions by to­day. In­vestors of both com­pa­nies will know the re­sults of the votes at sep­a­rate EGMs next Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Just for back­ground, share­hold­ers of the two com­pa­nies will vote on a pro­posed $2.1 bil­lion re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of Sem­bMarine, and its sub­se­quent de­merger from Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries. The deal will re­sult in par­ent Temasek hav­ing a larger di­rect stake in Sem­bMarine.</p>
    <p>The plan to re­cap­i­talise and res­cue the trou­bled off­shore and marine (O&M) player en­tails a five-for-one re­nounce­able rights is­sue at 20 cents a share.</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries will sub­scribe for up to $1.5 bil­lion of the rights shares by set­ting off a $1.5 bil­lion sub­or­di­nated loan it ex­tended to its sub­sidiary in June last year. These Sem­bMarine shares will then be dis­trib­uted in specie to Sem­b­corp</p>
    <p>In­dus­tries share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Temasek can­not vote on this.</p>
    <p>But as Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries’ big­gest share­holder with a 49.3 per cent stake, it has agreed to sub-un­der­write the re­main­ing $600 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The more cru­cial vote will be the one where only Sem­bMarine in­de­pen­dent share­hold­ers can ap­prove a “white­wash res­o­lu­tion” ab­solv­ing Temasek from making a takeover of­fer if it ends up ac­cu­mu­lat­ing more than 30 per cent of its shares dur­ing the ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Temasek could hold as much as 58 per cent of Sem­bMarine stock if its mi­nor­ity share­hold­ers give up their rights.</p>
    <p>Un­der Sin­ga­pore Ex­change rules, this would trig­ger a takeover of­fer for the com­pany. So a white­wash res­o­lu­tion would give it the req­ui­site waiver.</p>
    <p>All the res­o­lu­tions put to share­hold­ers of both com­pa­nies must pass for the ex­er­cise to go through.</p>
    <p>So much for back­ground. Here’s where the rub­ber hits the road.</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine has been fac­ing tur­bu­lence since 2015 amid volatile mar­ket con­di­tions in the O&M sec­tor. And things have be­come worse over the past cou­ple of years amid bat­tered oil mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, it an­nounced a net loss of $84 mil­lion in the first half.</p>
    <p>The firm is deep in debt and des­per­ately needs liq­uid­ity to fund projects, in­clud­ing some</p>
    <p>$1.4 bil­lion in or­ders as of June 30.</p>
    <p>If the re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion is ap­proved, it will help re­duce Sem­bMarine’s gear­ing and open the doors to more fund­ing.</p>
    <p>It is not just the quantum that mat­ters for Sem­bMarine. What is also crit­i­cal are the tim­ing and the ex­e­cu­tion. In short, it needs the money, and it needs it fast.</p>
    <p>Should the whole ex­er­cise be voted down, the com­pany will have to re-eval­u­ate other op­tions to ob­tain the fund­ing it needs. Given the econ­omy, it could go into fi­nan­cial stress if ad­e­quate al­ter­na­tive sources of fund­ing are not avail­able in time.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, ap­proval next Tues­day will al­low a re-en­er­gised</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine to chart a new path into green en­ergy and higher-value projects.</p>
    <p>Last month, it an­nounced a part­ner­ship with multi­na­tional GE to clinch a deal to build a 593 sq km wind farm off Bri­tain’s north-east coast. And it is al­ready making foun­da­tions for the For­mosa 2 off­shore wind farm in Tai­wan, as well as sub­sta­tion top­sides for the</p>
    <p>Hornsea 2 off­shore wind farm in the North Sea.</p>
    <p>In fact, about one-third of Sem­bMarine’s or­der book is now al­ready for “green en­ergy” projects, a niche where it has an op­por­tu­nity to es­tab­lish it­self as a global player.</p>
    <p>In short, re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion and de­con­sol­i­da­tion will lighten its debt bur­den, in­ject much-needed cash and free it up to chase new op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>For Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries, a de­merger of Sem­bMarine would mean it could fo­cus on its ur­ban in­fra­struc­ture and en­ergy busi­ness with­out be­ing weighed down by a trou­bled sub­sidiary.</p>
    <p>Of course, Sem­bMarine in­vestors will rightly pon­der whether to throw “good” money af­ter “bad”. Their shares are a frac­tion of what they were three years ago. Post-rights, fur­ther di­lu­tion could weigh them down even more, at least for a while.</p>
    <p>But share­hold­ers have re­ceived about $3 bil­lion in div­i­dend pay­outs from the com­pany over the past five years. And there is a prospect that as it re­cov­ers, they will be again re­warded for their faith.</p>
    <p>It’s a tough de­ci­sion. But crunch time is here. Share­hold­ers have un­til Fri­day evening to de­cide.</p>
