    <p>HONG KONG • More Covid-19 pa­tients in Hong Kong are dis­play­ing se­vere symp­toms dur­ing this fourth wave of in­fec­tions, prompt­ing med­i­cal ex­perts to in­ves­ti­gate if the cur­rent virus strain is a more vir­u­lent one.</p>
    <p>An anal­y­sis of of­fi­cial data by the South China Morn­ing Post (SCMP) re­vealed that as at Dec 6, those aged 30 to 69 ac­counted for more than 60 per cent of the se­ri­ously or crit­i­cally ill pa­tients in hos­pi­tal, the high point so far for such cases.</p>
    <p>It said the num­ber of ac­tive se­vere cases in that age group grad­u­ally i ncreased from five around the be­gin­ning of the fourth wave, to a high of 62 on Dec 12, ac­count­ing for 56 per cent of the 110 se­ri­ously ill pa­tients in public hos­pi­tals at that time.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent fourth wave has also seen a quicker rise in over­all in­fec­tions com­pared with past out­breaks, Pro­fes­sor David Hui Shu-cheong, a res­pi­ra­tory medicine ex­pert from Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong, told SCMP.</p>
    <p>Public con­cern has in­ten­si­fied af­ter a 42-yearold woman with­out any un­der­ly­ing con­di­tions died ear­lier this month, elic­it­ing a warn­ing from the health au­thor­i­ties that younger pa­tients could be more sus­cep­ti­ble to com­pli­ca­tions from the coro­n­avirus than pre­vi­ously thought.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the au­thor­i­ties are search­ing for a Covid-19-pos­i­tive pa­tient who es­caped from one of the city’s largest hos­pi­tals while un­der­go­ing treat­ment, ac­cord­ing to health of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The 63-year-old man was ad­mit­ted to the iso­la­tion ward of the Queen El­iz­a­beth Hos­pi­tal on Dec 14 af­ter it was con­firmed he had Covid-19, re­ported Reuters. But the man es­caped from the ward via a stair­well on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>A hos­pi­tal state­ment said the pa­tient was wear­ing a jacket over hos­pi­tal clothes, and that staff who spot­ted him failed to nab him de­spite a chase.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Cen­tre for Health Pro­tec­tion re­ported 109 new cases of Covid-19 yes­ter­day, tak­ing its to­tal tally to 8,078, re­ported news agency Xin­hua. The death tally stands at 129.</p>
