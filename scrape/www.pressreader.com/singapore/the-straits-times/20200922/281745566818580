    <p>I had gone into the tests a scep­tic, sus­pect­ing that the au­thor­i­ties might have been down­play­ing the dis­com­fort to avoid scar­ing peo­ple away.</p>
    <p>But none of them was as painful as I’d imag­ined them to be, and they were not as un­com­fort­able for me as other med­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ences such as draw­ing blood or get­ting a scope.</p>
    <p>The tests are no walk in the park, and I cer­tainly would not keep tak­ing them over and over again for fun.</p>
    <p>But given that swab­bing is free for those who are as­sessed as need­ing it, and they can grant peace of mind and help pro­tect oth­ers, I would say they are some­thing that should be ap­pre­ci­ated and un­der­taken rather than avoided.</p>
