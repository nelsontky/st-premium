    <p>Ms Parti Liyani was ac­cused of steal­ing a Prada bag worth $1,000 and a pair of Gucci sun­glasses worth $500 from Mr Karl Liew’s wife, Madam Heather Lim.</p>
    <p>Madam Lim tes­ti­fied that she had not dis­posed of ei­ther item, though nei­ther was in good con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>She said she used the bag, which had frayed, when go­ing to the gym and that the sun­glasses were stained red as a re­sult of be­ing rubbed against her bag.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn said the con­di­tion of the items sup­ported the de­fence’s con­tention that they had been dis­carded.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti said she found the bag in the trash at around the time Mr Karl Liew’s fam­ily moved out.</p>
    <p>The j udge said that Madam Lim’s cred­i­bil­ity was tainted by her tes­ti­mony that there were no bags of trash on the day of the move.</p>
    <p>The judge said it was im­plau­si­ble that noth­ing was dis­carded dur­ing a fam­ily’s mov­ing process, and that it was also “squarely con­tra­dicted” by Mr Liew Mun Leong, who said a lot of trash was gen­er­ated.</p>
