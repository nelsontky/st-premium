    <p>Would you choose to live for­ever if it meant no­body could re­mem­ber you, or live briefly but never be for­got­ten?</p>
    <p>“It’s a hard ques­tion,” ad­mits Amer­i­can fan­tasy au­thor V. E. Schwab. “There are days when I have such a fear of los­ing those I love that I think it would be a free­dom to move through the world un­teth­ered. But it would be so deeply lonely.”</p>
    <p>In her new novel, The In­vis­i­ble Life Of Ad­die LaRue, Schwab gave her hero­ine the fate of im­mem­o­rable im­mor­tal­ity. Ade­line LaRue, born in 17th-cen­tury ru­ral France, is flee­ing an ar­ranged mar­riage when she strikes a deal with a dark god in the woods.</p>
    <p>Now she can­not die, but no­body can re­mem­ber her af­ter they take their eyes off her. No mark she makes on the world lasts. So she wan­ders through the cen­turies, steal­ing and trick­ing to sur­vive, erased over and over from the minds of those she loves.</p>
    <p>Then, in mod­ern-day New York, she meets Henry, a young man in a book­store who seems to have the re­verse prob­lem: he can re­mem­ber her, but he him­self lives as if he has no time to lose.</p>
    <p>It took Schwab 10 years to write the book, she says over Skype from her par­ents’ 500-year-old stone cot­tage in the French coun­try­side, where she has been shel­ter­ing dur­ing the pan­demic. It is lo­cated 10 min­utes from where she set the open­ing of her book.</p>
    <p>Schwab, 33, op­er­ates on what she calls the “six-burner stove” writ­ing model, in which she has sev­eral projects on the boil at once, one on high heat and the rest sim­mer­ing in the back­ground.</p>
    <p>She has had Ad­die LaRue stew­ing since she was 24. “Even then, I had the sense that it was the kind of story you only get to tell once,” she says. “I would check in with it ev­ery year or two and I wouldn’t be ready.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore she turned 30, she be­gan to fear she would never be ready.</p>
    <p>“I thought, I’m go­ing to die with­out writ­ing this book. This is go­ing be the book I al­ways talk about and never write.</p>
    <p>“It turned out that I re­ally needed to hit 30, be­cause some of the themes i n the book are about</p>
    <p>She had de­men­tia for a decade and I watched it whit­tle away her en­tire iden­tity. The hard­est part was watch­ing her for­get my mother and watch­ing my mother feel for­got­ten.</p>
    <p>artificial adult­hood, this con­cept that you hit ma­tu­rity and ev­ery­one sud­denly as­sumes you know what you’re do­ing but you still feel like a child.”</p>
    <p>Schwab, a New York Times best­selling au­thor, made her name in the fan­tasy scene with her knack for writ­ing vil­lains in nov­els such as Vi­cious (2013), in which two col­lege room­mates be­come arch­en­e­mies and it is un­clear who is the hero, if in­deed any­one is.</p>
    <p>She has al­ways been more in­ter­ested in the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the hero and vil­lain than in ro­mance, she says.</p>
    <p>“There’s this weird thing that hap­pens where we de­value ev­ery other dy­namic in the book in the in­ter­est of the ro­mance, and I don’t want that.”</p>
    <p>In the Shades Of Magic se­ries (2015 to 2017), she cre­ated a set of par­al­lel Vic­to­rian-era Lon­dons colour-coded by the qual­ity of their</p>
    <p>V.E. SCHWAB, on her grand­mother’s de­men­tia, which gave her the idea of writ­ing the story of a woman who is per­pet­u­ally for­got­ten</p>
    <p>magic – Red, Grey, White and the de­stroyed Black.</p>
    <p>What she has on the stove now in­cludes Threads Of Power, a new tril­ogy set in the Shades Of Magic uni­verse; a Vi­cious comic; a tele­vi­sion show she is not al­lowed to speak about and a dark fairy tale novel she de­scribes as “Se­cret Gar­den meets Crim­son Peak (Guillermo del Toro’s 2015 gothic hor­ror film)”.</p>
    <p>But Ad­die LaRue, she says, is the “big­gest book” of her ca­reer.</p>
    <p>The idea of a woman who is per­pet­u­ally for­got­ten comes from some­thing deeply per­sonal: watch­ing her grand­mother suf­fer de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>“She had de­men­tia for a decade and I watched it whit­tle away her en­tire iden­tity. The hard­est part was watch­ing her for­get my mother and watch­ing my mother feel for­got­ten. It felt like a deeper wound.”</p>
    <p>She was sad­dened to have the book’s re­lease de­railed by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“But in some ways, it’s the right book to read dur­ing this year. This is such a dif­fi­cult year for so many people and the theme of this book is stub­born hope and defiant joy. It’s about a woman who sur­vives in­cred­i­ble hard­ship and tri­als and doesn’t lose her sense of hope.</p>
    <p>“So even though this book isn’t go­ing to start with the life that I wanted for it, I’ve made peace with the fact that it’s go­ing to have the life that it clearly needs to have.”</p>
