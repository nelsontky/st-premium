    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son yes­ter­day im­posed a tiered sys­tem of fur­ther re­stric­tions on parts of Eng­land, in­clud­ing clos­ing some pubs, as the coro­n­avirus out­break ac­cel­er­ates, though anger is ris­ing at the cost of the cur­tail­ment of free­doms.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son’s three-tier sys­tem, an­nounced in Par­lia­ment, is an at­tempt to stan­dard­ise a patch­work of of­ten com­pli­cated and con­fus­ing re­stric­tions across Eng­land. Law­mak­ers will vote on the move.</p>
    <p>The lock­downs will in­clude shut­ting pubs and bars in ar­eas placed into the “very high” alert level.</p>
    <p>So far, the only area in that cat­e­gory is Mersey­side, which in­cludes the city of Liver­pool, where the out­break is spread­ing the fastest.</p>
    <p>Gyms, leisure cen­tres, bet­ting shops, adult gam­ing cen­tres and casi­nos in Mersey­side will close, Mr John­son said.</p>
    <p>“I take no plea­sure what­so­ever in plac­ing re­stric­tions on these busi­nesses. Nor do I want to stop peo­ple en­joy­ing them­selves. But we must act to save lives,” Mr John­son told Par­lia­ment, adding that he did not want an­other na­tional lock­down.</p>
    <p>“If we let the virus rip, then the bleak math­e­mat­ics dic­tate that we would suf­fer not only an in­tol­er­a­ble death toll from Covid, but we would put such a huge strain on our NHS with an un­con­trolled sec­ond spike that our doc­tors and nurses would be un­able to de­vote them­selves to other treat­ments,” he said, re­fer­ring to the Na­tional Health Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The ris­ing in­fec­tion rates meant ac­tion must be taken im­me­di­ately, he added.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing been crit­i­cised for a lack of out­reach to may­ors and coun­cils, Mr John­son’s of­fice has stressed that the lat­est mea­sures had been dis­cussed with lo­cal lead­ers over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials say the fresh­est data showed in­fec­tions were ris­ing across the north of Eng­land and in some more southerly ar­eas too while the virus was creep­ing up age bands to­wards the el­derly from those aged 16 to 29.</p>
    <p>“Pretty much all ar­eas of the UK are now see­ing growths in the in­fec­tion rate,” Eng­land’s deputy chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Jonathan Van-Tam told re­porters. “The epi­demic, this time, has clearly picked up pace in the north of Eng­land ear­lier than it did in the first wave.”</p>
    <p>Manch­ester in­ten­sive care con­sul­tant Jane Ed­dle­ston said 30 per cent of crit­i­cal care beds were taken up with Covid-19 pa­tients – and it was start­ing to af­fect health­care for other pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“This is not how we want to live our lives but this is the nar­row path we have to tread be­tween the so­cial and eco­nomic trauma of a full lock­down and mas­sive hu­man and in­deed eco­nomic cost of an un­con­tained epi­demic,” Mr John­son said.</p>
    <p>“The weeks and months ahead will con­tinue to be dif­fi­cult and will test the met­tle of this coun­try.”</p>
    <p>But as mil­lions of peo­ple across Bri­tain grap­ple with anti-virus re­stric­tions, the hos­pi­tal­ity sec­tor says it is be­ing brought to its knees by the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Some pub own­ers are con­tem­plat­ing le­gal ac­tion over the move to close their es­tab­lish­ments, say­ing Mr John­son had not pro­duced the ev­i­dence to ex­plain why they were be­ing tar­geted. Cul­ture Sec­re­tary Oliver Dow­den had ear­lier told Sky News aca­demic re­search showed the risk of spread­ing the virus was higher in hos­pi­tal­ity set­tings such as bars and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>The Night Time In­dus­tries As­so­ci­a­tion, a Bri­tish trade body, on Sun­day said the in­dus­try had taken le­gal ac­tion to stop lock­down mea­sures from be­ing im­posed.</p>
    <p>“The in­dus­try has been left with no other op­tion but to legally chal­lenge the so-called ‘com­mon sense’ ap­proach nar­ra­tive from gov­ern­ment, on the im­ple­men­ta­tion of fur­ther re­stric­tions across the north of Eng­land,” the as­so­ci­a­tion’s CEO Michael Kill said. “These new mea­sures will have a cat­a­strophic im­pact on late-night busi­nesses, and are ex­ac­er­bated fur­ther by an in­suf­fi­cient fi­nan­cial sup­port pack­age.”</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment has faced mul­ti­ple law­suits over its re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus. The le­gal ma­noeu­vres can force of­fi­cials to ex­plain the rea­son­ing be­hind poli­cies or even make them aban­don some mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain recorded 13,972 new Covid-19 in­fec­tions and an­other 50 deaths yes­ter­day. In all, it has seen more than 617,000 con­firmed cases and nearly 43,000 fa­tal­i­ties from the dis­ease, of­fi­cial gov­ern­ment fig­ures showed.</p>
    <p>North­ern Eng­land has been par­tic­u­larly hard hit by a new surge of the deadly virus that has forced lo­cal lock­downs as stu­dents re­turned to schools and uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>“Of course, it is very chal­leng­ing for peo­ple,” Liver­pool Mayor Steve Rother­dam said on Sun­day. “The mea­sures we are tak­ing are hav­ing a bad im­pact on health, they are hav­ing a bad im­pact on the econ­omy, but ul­ti­mately it is bet­ter to do that than to al­low the virus to get out of con­trol.”</p>
