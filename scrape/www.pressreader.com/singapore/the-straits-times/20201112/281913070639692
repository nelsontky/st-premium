    <p>Many her­itage en­thu­si­asts have been dis­cussing the value of 1950s-1970s mod­ernist icons as cul­tural cap­i­tal that em­bod­ies the vi­sion­ary ideals and ar­chi­tec­tural prow­ess of Sin­ga­pore’s pi­o­neer­ing plan­ners, de­vel­op­ers, builders and ar­chi­tects.</p>
    <p>But build­ings such as Golden Mile Com­plex – which the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity has re­cently pro­posed for con­ser­va­tion, Peo­ple’s Park Com­plex and Wing On Life Build­ing are not just cul­tural cap­i­tal that speaks to our sense of his­tory. They are also en­vi­ron­men­tal cap­i­tal sug­gest­ing a path­way to a low car­bon fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Ex­tend­ing the lives of old mod­ernist build­ings is not just to com­mem­o­rate the hu­man imag­i­na­tion and skills that went into pro­duc­ing them, the com­mu­ni­ties that lived in them, and the so­ci­ety that ex­pe­ri­enced and knew them – though th­ese are wor­thy enough rea­sons.</p>
    <p>We also re­duce ma­te­rial waste, con­serve em­bod­ied en­ergy and sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce our con­tri­bu­tion to the cli­mate cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In 2007, the United Na­tions de­cided to re­ha­bil­i­tate, not de­mol­ish and re­build, its New</p>
    <p>York head­quar­ters – and not just be­cause it is a 1951 mod­ernist mas­ter­piece. Cal­cu­la­tions showed that even if a highly en­ergy-ef­fi­cient, new struc­ture were to re­place the age­ing com­plex, it would still take 35 to 70 years to off­set emis­sions in­curred by de­mo­li­tion and re­build­ing.</p>
    <p>Mod­ernist build­ings are com­posed mainly of con­crete, which is par­tic­u­larly high in em­bod­ied car­bon con­tent. Glob­ally, the man­u­fac­ture of ce­ment, a key in­gre­di­ent of con­crete, is the fourth-largest con­trib­u­tor to car­bon emis­sions, be­hind petrol, coal and nat­u­ral gas.</p>
    <p>So what is the ac­tual amount of em­bod­ied car­bon in a build­ing? Engi­neer­ing firm Web Struc­ture di­rec­tor Hossein Rezai es­ti­mates that erect­ing just the con­crete frame of a typ­i­cal 40-storey struc­ture in Kuala Lumpur will pro­duce up to an emis­sion of 51 mil­lion kg of car­bon diox­ide – the equiv­a­lent amount se­questered by 8.75 mil­lion trees in a year.</p>
    <p>Build­ing a sim­i­lar con­crete struc­ture in Sin­ga­pore is es­ti­mated by Dr Rezai to emit 25 per cent to 50 per cent more car­bon diox­ide.</p>
    <p>A 2019 re­port by the World Green Build­ing Coun­cil (WGBC) ad­dressed a com­mon mis­con­cep­tion that car­bon emis­sions of a build­ing only need to be mea­sured in op­er­a­tional terms – en­ergy con­sump­tion by air-con­di­tion­ing, light­ing, wa­ter heat­ing and so on. The re­port es­ti­mated that of the to­tal car­bon emis­sion in the life­span of a typ­i­cal build­ing, as much as 30 per cent is em­bod­ied – in­curred by its con­struc­tion – with the rest due to build­ing op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>WGBC chair Lisa Bate as­sessed that the per­cent­age of em­bod­ied car­bon would be even higher for a typ­i­cal build­ing in Sin­ga­pore, given the much shorter prop­erty de­vel­op­ment cy­cles here that see many build­ings be­ing pre­ma­turely de­mol­ished.</p>
    <p>In this light, con­serv­ing age­ing mod­ernist high-rise con­crete build­ings, such as Golden Mile Com­plex, will lead to a sig­nif­i­cant re­duc­tion in car­bon foot­print.</p>
    <p>Go­ing fur­ther, if re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion were to be­come an ac­cepted, and even main­stream, mode of ur­ban re­de­vel­op­ment, there would be an ex­po­nen­tial ef­fect on car­bon sav­ings. This is es­pe­cially so given Sin­ga­pore’s large stock of age­ing con­crete build­ings, in­clud­ing public hous­ing flats. They have great po­ten­tial to be imag­i­na­tively and sus­tain­ably retro­fit­ted.</p>
    <p>EN­HANC­ING THOSE AS­SETS</p>
    <p>Lo­cal prop­erty de­vel­op­ers with large-scale com­mer­cial prop­er­ties in­creas­ingly recog­nise the ad­van­tages of in­vest­ing in a green retro­fit, as what is termed an</p>
    <p>As­set En­hance­ment Ini­tia­tive (AEI) cen­tred on re­con­fig­u­ra­tion, de­sign update and up­grad­ing en­ergy ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial gains in­clude cost sav­ings from im­proved build­ing per­for­mance and in­creased rental from up­graded fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, more key ten­ants – es­pe­cially multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions whose cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity pol­icy in­vari­ably pri­ori­tises en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity – are seek­ing low car­bon-foot­print premises, and favour­ing prop­er­ties that are well “re­ha­bil­i­tated”, rather than re­built anew.</p>
    <p>A re­cently com­pleted AEI project is the ren­o­va­tion of the for­mer DBS Tower in Shen­ton Way. The tallest build­ing in Sin­ga­pore when com­pleted in 1975 and de­signed by pioneer ar­chi­tect Lim Chong Keat, its iconic seg­mented tower dom­i­nated the skyline then.</p>
    <p>In 2017, it was re­born as OUE Down­town, a mixed-use de­vel­op­ment in glass and steel. Though not car­ried out with the in­ten­tion of con­ser­va­tion – and the out­come is no longer recog­nis­able as DBS Tower – the project showed how the re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion of an age­ing high-rise is tech­ni­cally and eco­nom­i­cally vi­able.</p>
    <p>This con­trasted starkly with the de­mo­li­tion of the neigh­bour­ing CPF Tower of sim­i­lar vin­tage.</p>
    <p>The retrofitti­ng of ex­ist­ing build­ings to im­prove en­ergy per­for­mance is al­ready en­cour­aged by the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity (BCA) through its Green Mark rat­ing sys­tem. How­ever, in as­sess­ing en­ergy ef­fi­ciency, the fo­cus is mainly on build­ing oper­a­tion prac­tices and con­struc­tion meth­ods. De­spite the sig­nif­i­cant car­bon-foot­print re­duc­tion, the em­bod­ied car­bon cap­tured within a con­served or re­tained build­ing struc­ture does not count to­wards to­tal en­ergy sav­ings in Green Mark as­sess­ment cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>This omis­sion should be rec­ti­fied so that de­vel­op­ers and build­ing pro­fes­sion­als who em­brace the more sus­tain­able prac­tice of build­ing re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion are given due recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>INNOVATION IN CON­SER­VA­TION</p>
    <p>Be­yond a reg­u­lar build­ing retro­fit, more de­sign pa­ram­e­ters would come into play with con­serv­ing an age­ing high-rise mod­ernist struc­ture of ex­cep­tional ar­chi­tec­tural, his­toric and so­cial sig­nif­i­cance such as Golden Mile Com­plex.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers and build­ing pro­fes­sion­als would need to step up their game in cre­atively re­pro­gram­ming and re­con­fig­ur­ing a mod­ernist mas­ter­piece with­out com­pro­mis­ing its in­her­ent at­tributes, work­ing sen­si­tively to op­ti­mise its ar­chi­tec­tural char­ac­ter and her­itage value, while deftly en­gag­ing its orig­i­nal stepped form, in­clined atrium and colon­naded sky deck.</p>
    <p>A key chal­lenge is build­ing code com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>Given that the struc­ture was erected ac­cord­ing to build­ing codes, a pre­scrip­tive ap­proach to com­pli­ance may lead to the loss of many orig­i­nal fea­tures.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain and Ger­many, per­for­mance-based build­ing codes are de­vel­oped to in­cen­tivise green retro­fit projects and help over­come reg­u­la­tory lim­i­ta­tions. More flex­i­bil­ity could be sim­i­larly in­tro­duced by the BCA and the</p>
    <p>Fire Safety and Shel­ter Depart­ment by em­brac­ing per­for­mance-based eval­u­a­tion, and ex­emp­tions given to con­ser­va­tion re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion projects.</p>
    <p>Build­ing guide­lines, such as Green Mark cri­te­ria, would need to evolve quickly to pave the way for more sus­tain­able ur­ban de­vel­op­ment. As with the un­prece­dented raft of plan­ning in­cen­tives of­fered to po­ten­tial buy­ers of Golden Mile Com­plex, this would ne­ces­si­tate in­ter-agency and in­ter-min­istry col­lab­o­ra­tion, per­haps co­or­di­nated by Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>RE­THINK­ING ‘BLANK-SLATE’</p>
    <p>Such a fun­da­men­tal shift in ap­proach calls for a change in mind­set; we have to relook cur­rent def­i­ni­tions of ur­ban growth and the heavy re­liance on the “blank slate” ap­proach to de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>We need to raise aware­ness about the real, long-term cost across the real es­tate ecosys­tem, from the Gov­ern­ment, con­struc­tion in­dus­try, plan­ners and pro­fes­sion­als to prop­erty own­ers and build­ing users.</p>
    <p>Na­tional, re­gional and global move­ments have sprung up in the past year, in re­sponse to the cli­mate change cri­sis, to ques­tion cur­rent prac­tices and as­sump­tions in the build­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Prime ex­am­ples of such move­ments in­clude Sin­ga­pore Ar­chi­tects De­clare Cli­mate and Bio­di­ver­sity Emer­gency (sg.ar­chi­tects­de­clare.com), Ar­chi­tects’ Jour­nal Retrofirst (ar­chi­tect­sjour­nal.co.uk/ news/retrofirst) and the Cli­mate Her­itage Net­work (cli­mate­heritage.org).</p>
    <p>If cre­ative and green retrofitti­ng is used in re­vi­tal­is­ing older con­crete build­ings and the larger ur­ban land­scape, it will go a long way to help Sin­ga­pore in meet­ing its tar­get of peak car­bon emis­sion by 2030 and halv­ing the peak by 2050, as spelt out re­cently by the In­ter-Min­is­te­rial Com­mit­tee on Cli­mate Change.</p>
    <p>One of the three thrusts of the cli­mate strat­egy it laid out is the trans­for­ma­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s in­dus­try, econ­omy and so­ci­ety through bold plans such as cap­tur­ing more so­lar en­ergy and phas­ing out in­ter­nal-com­bus­tion en­gine ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>Cre­ative and green retro­fit of mod­ernist build­ings can like­wise be part of the trans­for­ma­tion of the con­struc­tion in­dus­try, real es­tate mar­ket and her­itage con­ser­va­tion needed for a vi­brant low-car­bon fu­ture.</p>
    <p>If re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion were to be­come an ac­cepted, and even main­stream, mode of ur­ban re­de­vel­op­ment, there would be an ex­po­nen­tial ef­fect on car­bon sav­ings. This is es­pe­cially so given Sin­ga­pore’s large stock of age­ing con­crete build­ings, in­clud­ing public hous­ing flats. They have great po­ten­tial to be imag­i­na­tively and sus­tain­ably retro­fit­ted.</p>
