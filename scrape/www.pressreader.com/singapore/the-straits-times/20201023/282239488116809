    <p>Australian Adam Scott has with­drawn from the Zozo Cham­pi­onship after test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the PGA Tour said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Scott, the win­ner of 14 PGA Tour ti­tles, last com­peted in last month’s US Open and was ex­pected to be among the big­gest names at the tour­na­ment, which started yes­ter­day and was re­lo­cated from Ja­pan to Thou­sand Oaks, Cal­i­for­nia, due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“While it’s dif­fi­cult news to re­ceive – as I re­ally looked for­ward to play­ing this week – my fo­cus now is on re­cov­ery for the fi­nal stretch of the fall,” said the world No. 15, who won the Masters in 2013.</p>
    <p>First al­ter­nate Jim Her­man, who won the Wyn­d­ham Cham­pi­onship in Au­gust, will re­place Scott in the com­pe­ti­tion, the Tour said.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has wiped out the cir­cuit’s Asian swing – last week­end’s CJ Cup was moved from South Korea to Shadow Creek in Las Ve­gas, while the WGC-HSBC Cham­pi­ons, orig­i­nally set for next week in Shang­hai, has been can­celled.</p>
    <p>Both events as well as the Zozo Cham­pi­onship, which de­buted as Ja­pan’s first PGA-sanc­tioned tour­na­ment, are ex­pected to re­turn to their re­spec­tive host coun­tries next year.</p>
    <p>There are still two more warmup events be­fore the Nov 12-15 Masters, but for many stars, Zozo may be their last event be­fore they head for Au­gusta Na­tional.</p>
    <p>Since the Tour’s restart in June after a three-month hia­tus, fans have been barred from at­tend­ing and it is the same case at Zozo.</p>
    <p>But the Tour is plan­ning to al­low for a lim­ited crowd of 2,000 peo­ple at the Hous­ton Open, which ends just four days be­fore the Masters.</p>
    <p>While five-time Ma­jor win­ner Phil Mick­el­son be­lieves the cir­cuit can pull off its first event with fans amid the pan­demic, it is a risk he is un­likely to take on, es­pe­cially with the year’s third Ma­jor oc­cur­ring so soon after.</p>
    <p>Re­veal­ing he was lean­ing to­wards giv­ing Hous­ton a skip, he said: “The PGA Tour has done an in­cred­i­ble job of get­ting the play­ers to com­pete in a safe en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“I think they’ve done a phe­nom­e­nal job of hav­ing us feel safe. I think they will do a very good, safe job in hav­ing 2,000 peo­ple at the Hous­ton Open.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, for me per­son­ally, I don’t like the risk of hav­ing that hap­pen the week be­fore the Masters. I just feel like the week be­fore the Masters, that’s a big tour­na­ment we have and I just don’t want to have any risk head­ing in there.</p>
    <p>“So it has made me ques­tion whether or not I’ll play there. I don’t go out and so­cialise be­cause I want to make sure I have an op­por­tu­nity to com­pete in the Masters.”</p>
    <p>Separately, the Dec 10-13 US Women’s Open will be held with­out fans this year, the United States Golf As­so­ci­a­tion said.</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment, which is in its 75th year and is the old­est of the five women’s Ma­jors, was pre­vi­ously resched­uled from June and will be held at Cham­pi­ons Golf Club in Hous­ton.</p>
