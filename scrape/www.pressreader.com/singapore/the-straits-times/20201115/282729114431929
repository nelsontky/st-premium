    <p>Fancy own­ing a lux­u­ri­ous home right in the English Chan­nel?</p>
    <p>For just $7 mil­lion, you can own this cir­cu­lar man-made is­land, known as Spit­bank Fort, which sits less than a kilo­me­tre off the south­ern coast of Eng­land in the So­lent, a nar­row wa­ter­way feed­ing the English Chan­nel.</p>
    <p>One of three sim­i­lar is­lands built by the Bri­tish mil­i­tary dur­ing the 1860s, the re­fur­bished fortress has 33,000 sq ft of liv­ing space cov­er­ing three floors, with 12 bed­rooms, two kitchens, a pool, a cen­tral court­yard and mul­ti­ple leisure, event and din­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The Spit­bank Fort has played var­i­ous roles since its hey­day as a de­fence post against French ships ap­proach­ing the coastal city of Portsmouth. Since be­ing de­com­mis­sioned in the 1950s, it has been a mu­seum, a night­club and, most re­cently, a bou­tique ho­tel and event space.</p>
    <p>“When you buy into prop­erty like this, you’re buy­ing a slice of Bri­tish his­tory which is ut­terly unique and truly spe­cial,” said Mr James Macken­zie, head of Strutt & Parker’s coun­try de­part­ment, which has the res­i­den­tial list­ing.</p>
    <p>The fort, about 46m in di­am­e­ter, can be main­tained as a ho­tel or con­verted into a pri­vate res­i­dence, said its seller Mike Clare, an en­trepreneur and de­vel­oper of unique prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>“It’s like a huge yacht,” he said. Mr Clare bought the is­land in 2009 and ren­o­vated it ex­ten­sively, build­ing around its fresh­wa­ter well and 4.6m-thick gran­ite walls. A stone tun­nel from the land­ing stage leads to the mid­dle deck, where a cen­tral brick-walled court­yard has stairs lead­ing up and down.</p>
    <p>Rooms are ar­ranged in two con­cen­tric rings around the court­yard. The in­ner ring has two half bath­rooms, a li­brary and a lounge, while the outer ring has eight bed­rooms with en suite baths that were once gun rooms.</p>
    <p>To­day, they have re­claimed pol­ished oak floors and win­dows over­look­ing the So­lent. The outer ring also has a bar, a din­ing room that seats 60, a com­mer­cial-grade kitchen and a func­tional space for crew.</p>
    <p>The lower deck houses the fort’s his­toric kitchen, an in­ti­mate wine cel­lar and bar, staff quar­ters with three bed­rooms and two bath­rooms, and sev­eral game and TV rooms.</p>
    <p>The up­per level has three half baths, a sauna, two sun decks on op­po­site sides, a fire pit with built-in seat­ing, and an el­e­vated crow’s nest with a bed­room and an ad­ja­cent event room with a bar. The hot pool seats up to 18 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Spit­bank Fort is for sale along with its two sis­ter fortresses in the So­lent. The other two are larger, at 99,000 sq ft, and only one has been ren­o­vated.</p>
    <p>The trio can be pur­chased in­di­vid­u­ally or to­gether for £9.25 mil­lion (S$16.4 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>The is­land city of Portsmouth, with a pop­u­la­tion of some 200,000, has sev­eral his­toric at­trac­tions, in­clud­ing a dock­yard with the 18th-cen­tury navy ship HMS Vic­tory, and the Charles Dick­ens Birth­place Mu­seum.</p>
    <p>Southamp­ton In­ter­na­tional Air­port is about 30 min­utes from the har­bour, and London’s Heathrow is about an hour north.</p>
