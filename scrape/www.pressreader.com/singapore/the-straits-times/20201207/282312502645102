    <p>For 15 days from when Vianna was born on March 17, Ms Vivi­enne Low, 35, could touch only her new­born daugh­ter’s tiny hands and watch her fight for her life through the clear glass panes of the in­cu­ba­tor in the neona­tal in­ten­sive care unit (NICU) at KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal (KKH).</p>
    <p>Born 10 weeks early and weigh­ing just 758g – a fourth of the weight of a reg­u­lar baby – Vianna pulled through, thanks in part to a rich sup­ply of breast milk from her mother.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 8 per cent and 9 per cent of ba­bies here are pre­ma­ture, a fig­ure that has held steady be­tween 2014 and last year, the Min­istry of Health said.</p>
    <p>These pre­ma­ture ba­bies (pre­emies) need nu­tri­tious breast milk to give them a fight­ing chance, as their im­ma­ture di­ges­tive sys­tems are not tol­er­ant of for­mula milk.</p>
    <p>For­mula milk is also as­so­ci­ated with a three to 10 times in­creased risk of pre­ma­ture ba­bies devel­op­ing necro­tis­ing en­te­ro­col­i­tis, a se­ri­ous in­testi­nal ill­ness. Ba­bies who de­velop the ill­ness may be re­quired to stay in hos­pi­tal for an ad­di­tional three weeks and, in more se­vere cases, may need surgery.</p>
    <p>Many moth­ers of pre­ma­ture ba­bies may ex­pe­ri­ence dif­fi­cul­ties in pro­vid­ing enough breast milk for their own ba­bies, es­pe­cially in the first few days, said Dr Chua Mei Chien, the head and se­nior con­sul­tant at the depart­ment of neona­tol­ogy in KKH, who is also the direc­tor of the KK Hu­man Milk Bank.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s only milk bank at KKH does not just help pre­ma­ture in­fants, but also has suf­fi­cient re­serves to help in­fants 12 months and younger with med­i­cal prob­lems such as mal­ab­sorp­tion and con­gen­i­tal com­plex heart disease.</p>
    <p>More than 8,600 litres of hu­man milk have been do­nated since the bank was set up in Au­gust 2017, help­ing more than 1,963 ba­bies in Sin­ga­pore. More than 735 moth­ers have also do­nated their milk.</p>
    <p>Ms Low, a public ser­vant, is the KK Hu­man Milk Bank cham­pion donor, hav­ing do­nated a to­tal of 214 litres of breast milk as at Nov 30. She con­trib­uted 139 litres dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>An­other mother who do­nated gen­er­ously is 39-year-old Junette De Je­sus, an IT busi­ness an­a­lyst, who do­nated 175 litres in the first nine months of this year.</p>
    <p>Healthy women of any na­tion­al­ity can do­nate to the bank.</p>
    <p>Ms Low said: “I had to start pump­ing im­me­di­ately af­ter Vianna was born to es­tab­lish a good sup­ply of milk. Thank­fully, sup­ply came quickly but Vianna drank very lit­tle, con­sum­ing just 50ml per day when she was just born, and I was pump­ing some 1.5 litres a day.”</p>
    <p>Ms Low de­cided to do­nate the sur­plus to the milk bank.</p>
    <p>Vianna is Ms Low’s sec­ond child, but this is the first time she has do­nated milk to the bank.</p>
    <p>“These pre­ma­ture ba­bies – they come to the NICU and start fight­ing for their lives... If what I can do can give them a bet­ter fight­ing chance, then why not?” Ms Low added.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, the milk bank also suc­cess­fully main­tained a healthy re­serve of two months of pas­teurised donor hu­man milk at all times, even as milk banks in other coun­tries ex­pe­ri­enced a sharp de­cline in do­na­tions, largely due to the fear of con­tract­ing the coro­n­avirus when out­doors or in hos­pi­tals, Dr Chua said.</p>
    <p>A slew of mea­sures here, in­clud­ing a courier ser­vice to fa­cil­i­tate the col­lec­tion of breast milk from donors un­able to visit the milk bank as well as the de­liv­ery of donor milk to re­cip­i­ents in the com­mu­nity, helped to re­as­sure moth­ers and fa­cil­i­tate do­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit breaker – which led to many work­ing from home – also af­forded moth­ers more time and con­ve­nience to pump milk. This re­sulted in a 60 per cent in­crease in milk do­nated per donor from April to July com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, said Dr Chua.</p>
    <p>Since the bank’s launch, ex­clu­sive hu­man milk feed­ing – feed­ing with the mother’s own milk as well as pas­teurised donor hu­man milk – in KKH’s NICU has in­creased from 20 per cent to 97 per cent.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of in­fants who de­vel­oped necro­tis­ing en­te­ro­col­i­tis has also dropped from 5.8 per cent in Au­gust 2017 to 2 per cent in July this year.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, the team be­hind the bank was awarded the Na­tional Clin­i­cal Ex­cel­lence Team Award.</p>
    <p>The bank, which is funded by phi­lan­thropic or­gan­i­sa­tion Te­masek Foun­da­tion, also re­ceived ad­di­tional fund­ing from the foun­da­tion to ex­pand the pro­gramme from hos­pi­tals to the com­mu­nity from July last year to ben­e­fit more in­fants.</p>
