    <p>• In­done­sia’s Par­lia­ment is set to vote within weeks on a flag­ship job cre­ation Bill to im­prove the in­vest­ment climate and stream­line busi­ness rules in South-east Asia’s big­gest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Some of its pro­vi­sions have been con­tro­ver­sial, es­pe­cially re­gard­ing the en­vi­ron­ment and changes pro­posed to the 2003 labour law which trade unions view as be­ing too probusi­ness.</p>
    <p>Here are key el­e­ments of the Bill agreed by Par­lia­ment’s leg­is­la­tion com­mit­tee, ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment pre­sen­ta­tions and law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>They still need ap­proval from min­is­ters and fur­ther ap­proval by Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>LABOUR RE­FORMS</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers ap­proved a cut in manda­tory sev­er­ance ben­e­fits paid by em­ploy­ers, to 23 times monthly wages from 32 times, with the gov­ern­ment fund­ing the short­fall.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal pro­posal was for a cut to 19 times, and for work­ers los­ing em­ploy­ment to re­ceive state in­sur­ance and skills train­ing.</p>
    <p>Min­i­mum wage lim­its at city and district lev­els will stay, with an­nual rises tied to eco­nomic growth and in­fla­tion, but some sec­tors will lose special treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally, the gov­ern­ment had pro­posed set­ting min­i­mum wages only at the pro­vin­cial level, with in­creases pegged to eco­nomic growth, and for labour-in­ten­sive sec­tors to set their own min­i­mum wages.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee agreed to drop manda­tory paid leave for fam­ily wed­dings, bap­tism, child­birth, be­reave­ment and men­strual leave for women, so em­ploy­ers and work­ers could fix their own terms.</p>
    <p>MPs ap­proved re­lax­ing strict rules on out­sourc­ing and scrapped a rule on a three-year max­i­mum term for con­trac­tors.</p>
    <p>Work over­time can be in­creased to four hours a day from three now.</p>
    <p>BUSI­NESS PER­MITS AND REG­U­LA­TIONS</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses that are con­sid­ered low-risk now only need to reg­is­ter be­fore they be­gin op­er­a­tions, while medium-risk ones have to fol­low a set of stan­dards and only high-risk in­vest­ments must ob­tain a per­mit.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­men­tal stud­ies are re­quired only for in­vest­ments con­sid­ered to be high-risk.</p>
    <p>The process for in­vest­ment per­mits for prov­inces and lo­cal gov­ern­ments will be stan­dard­ised, with the cen­tral gov­ern­ment able to take it over in some cases.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral gov­ern­ment will take over the pro­ce­dure for in­vest­ment per­mits to projects con­sid­ered of na­tional strate­gic im­por­tance.</p>
    <p>SOV­ER­EIGN WEALTH FUND</p>
    <p>The Bill also lays the foun­da­tion for the for­ma­tion of a sov­er­eign wealth fund.</p>
    <p>LAND BANK</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment can set up a land bank and man­age this to ac­quire land for public in­ter­est and re­dis­tribute the land.</p>
    <p>NEG­A­TIVE IN­VEST­MENT LIST</p>
    <p>The Bill also paves the way for re­forms of the so-called “neg­a­tive in­vest­ment list” of sec­tors in which for­eign par­tic­i­pa­tion is re­stricted or lim­ited.</p>
    <p>A sep­a­rate gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tion will de­tail the sec­tors to be opened up.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ters have said that af­ter pas­sage of the Bill, only a hand­ful of re­stricted sec­tors will re­main, such as gam­bling, arms and nar­cotics.</p>
