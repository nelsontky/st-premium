    <p>I love big cars. Who doesn’t? You get space. You get pres­ence. And did I men­tion space?</p>
    <p>The new Kia Sorento de­liv­ers on that front (and back) fairly well. Built on a new plat­form, the sev­enseater sport util­ity ve­hi­cle (SUV) is big­ger than its al­ready size­able pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>Mea­sur­ing 4,810mm long and 1,900mm wide, it is both 10mm longer and wider than the pre­vi­ous Sorento. At 1,700mm, it is 15mm taller too. And the peo­ple mover’s wheel­base has grown by 35mm to 2,815mm.</p>
    <p>In the metal, it looks big­ger than it is. In fact, it looks al­most as im­pos­ing as big Ger­man multi-seat SUVs such as the Audi Q7 and BMW X5, both of which have more gen­er­ous di­men­sions.</p>
    <p>Styling-wise, the Sorento has shed some of its pre­de­ces­sor’s softer curves for an edgier, sportier sil­hou­ette. It wears a more ag­gres­sive tiger grille which lit­er­ally blends with the car’s slim head­lights. Its lower bumper assem­bly hints at aero­dy­namism and com­plex­ity, which is em­pha­sised by cos­metic side vents and a rear spoiler.</p>
    <p>It is not some­thing you would de­scribe as beau­ti­ful – not many large SUVs are – but it ex­udes an aura.</p>
    <p>Its real beauty lies in the way it moves. The fourth-gen­er­a­tion Sorento, de­spite its size, is em­i­nently drive­able.</p>
    <p>Its new 2.2-litre tur­bod­iesel en­gine pro­duces 202hp and 440Nm of torque – equiv­a­lent to the pre­vi­ous tur­bod­iesel which was 48cc smaller. Paired with an eight-speed dual-clutch trans­mis­sion (six-speed auto pre­vi­ously), it af­fords the big multi-seater a sur­pris­ing light­foot­ed­ness.</p>
    <p>Say what you may about diesels, they have plenty of shove, mak­ing them ideal for big­ger, heftier ve­hi­cles (the Sorento weighs over 1.8 tonnes).</p>
    <p>They are fuel ef­fi­cient too. The test-car av­er­aged 8.5 litres/100km, which is no­tice­ably bet­ter than the Mazda CX-8 re­viewed here two weeks ago. As diesel is cheaper than petrol, your run­ning cost is go­ing to be sig­nif­i­cantly lower.</p>
    <p>Equally sur­pris­ing is the fact that the Sorento falls within the Ve­hic­u­lar Emis­sions Scheme’s neu­tral band, which means it is as clean as most petrols.</p>
    <p>The other like­able thing about the car is its ride and han­dling. Its sus­pen­sion is de­cid­edly com­fort­bias, but with­out the boat-like move­ments of­ten found in big SUVs.</p>
    <p>At the wheel, you do not feel the car’s size. But be­ing a front-wheeldrive (the pre­vi­ous tur­bod­iesel was all-wheel-driven) with so much torque from its tur­bod­iesel, you will some­times hear squeal­ing rub­bers if you squeeze the throt­tle a lit­tle too hard at the lights.</p>
    <p>Yes, the car is not as re­fined, with slightly more vi­bra­tions than you would feel in the petrol car. But the sound of dis­tant trac­tors – which diesels are usu­ally known for – is al­most un­de­tectable.</p>
    <p>The Sorento is well-equipped. It has adap­tive cruise con­trol and lane-keep­ing, as well as elec­tric park­ing brake with auto-hold func­tion.</p>
    <p>When you sig­nal to turn, a rear side view ap­pears on the car’s 12.3-inch in­stru­ment panel (on the side cor­re­spond­ing to in­tended turn) – a nifty first. I use it to gauge the wheels’ dis­tance from the kerb as the car’s re­verse cam­era has not been in­stalled.</p>
    <p>The pow­ered tail­gate opens to re­veal a us­able boot – even with the third row of seats up.</p>
    <p>You will also find ven­ti­lated front seats, wire­less phone charg­ing and a de­lec­ta­ble Bose 12-speaker sound sys­tem. The in­te­rior am­bi­ent light­ing is sub­tle and the head-up dis­play is clear.</p>
    <p>In short, the car is rather peachy to drive. As for the rest of the fam­ily, I bet they love big cars too.</p>
