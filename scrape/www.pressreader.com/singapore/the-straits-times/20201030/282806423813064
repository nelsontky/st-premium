    <p>With fewer oc­ca­sions to dress up as well as an in­creas­ing aware­ness of fash­ion’s en­vi­ron­men­tal costs, shop­pers may de­cide to buy less, but buy bet­ter. All of this favours lux­ury houses steeped in her­itage, such as Her­mes.</p>
    <p>One take­away from the third-quar­ter earn­ings peo­ple have seen so far is that con­sumers are still spend­ing – and they are reach­ing for big, well-known brands for ev­ery­thing from food to face cream.</p>
    <p>This has played out most dra­mat­i­cally in high-end re­tail, where in some cases, wealthy shop­pers are buy­ing more ex­pen­sive goods than they were a year ago.</p>
    <p>There are a few rea­sons why this may be. As I have noted, some of the spend­ing is com­ing from sav­ings ac­cu­mu­lated dur­ing lock­down and af­flu­ent con­sumers want to get the most bang for their buck.</p>
    <p>If they are reach­ing out­side their reg­u­lar price range or mak­ing their first lux­ury pur­chase, that of­ten means shelling out for a house­hold name: Louis Vuit­ton, Chris­tian Dior or Her­mes – all of which have seen strong sales re­cov­er­ies.</p>
    <p>It also helps that the big­gest com­pa­nies – LVMH Moet Hen­nessy Louis Vuit­ton, Her­mes In­ter­na­tional, Cie Fi­nanciere Richemont and Gucci-owner Ker­ing – have the re­sources to make their brands stand out in a crowded mar­ket. They can af­ford to dou­ble down on so­cial me­dia cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, con­sumers want tried-and-tested styles, whether that is a Her­mes Birkin bag or a Mon­cler puffer jacket.</p>
    <p>With fewer oc­ca­sions to dress up as well as an in­creas­ing aware­ness of fash­ion’s en­vi­ron­men­tal costs, shop­pers may de­cide to buy less, but buy bet­ter.</p>
    <p>All of this favours lux­ury houses steeped in her­itage, such as Her­mes, the first high-end group to re­turn to sales growth in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The hand­bag maker was also helped by the fact that it is less de­pen­dent on tourist spend­ing, which ac­counts for about 20 per cent of sales glob­ally, than its com­peti­tors, which see 30 per cent to 35 per cent of sales come from tourists, ac­cord­ing to Mr Thomas Chau­vet, lux­ury an­a­lyst at Citi.</p>
    <p>But the shift in de­mand from cut­ting-edge to clas­sic may be more of a chal­lenge for Gucci, where sales ex­clud­ing cur­rency move­ments fell 8.9 per cent in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Its flam­boy­ant aes­thetic has won a strong fol­low­ing among younger cus­tomers. But it is now ton­ing down its os­ten­ta­tious styles to adapt to more con­ser­va­tive tastes.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers reach­ing for the fa­mil­iar also cre­ates par­tic­u­lar chal­lenges for smaller com­pa­nies. Given the power of the lux­ury con­glom­er­ates and mus­cu­lar sin­gle-brand groups such as Mon­cler, there may now be more pres­sure to sell out to them.</p>
    <p>Sal­va­tore Fer­rag­amo, for ex­am­ple, has not re­ported its third-quar­ter sales yet, but the Ital­ian house’s turn­around ef­forts have been dis­rupted by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­vestors will be watch­ing to see whether Fer­rag­amo and other com­pa­nies seek­ing to re­vive their for­tunes, such as Burberry Group, are sim­i­larly lifted by the ris­ing lux­ury tide.</p>
    <p>Fer­rag­amo de­nied this week that it held talks with in­vestors over a po­ten­tial stake sale. But the fam­ily-con­trolled group would be wise not to turn its back on any op­tions.</p>
    <p>The strides that the mega-brands have made this year will make it harder for smaller houses to gain trac­tion with the wealth­i­est shop­pers, even as a strong re­cov­ery in de­mand for lux­ury is ex­pected next year.</p>
    <p>Of course, there is a pos­si­bil­ity that con­sumer tastes pivot back to­wards ex­per­i­men­ta­tion when the world re­turns to some sem­blance of nor­mal­ity. But that fu­ture seems far away and far from cer­tain.</p>
    <p>Even if shop­pers do want less fa­mil­iar, more edgy de­signs, com­pa­nies will need to reach them on­line and through so­cial me­dia chan­nels.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing the best re­tail lo­ca­tions and hottest de­sign­ers will also re­main cru­cial. That means con­tin­ued in­vest­ment for all groups, big and small.</p>
    <p>If life con­tin­ues to get tougher for more niche brands, the next hot trend in lux­ury could be a shake-up of in­dus­try own­er­ship.</p>
