    <p>Sin­ga­pore will co­op­er­ate with the United Na­tions to draw up a check­list of the steps coun­tries will need to take to im­ple­ment a set of norms on cy­ber se­cu­rity and re­spon­si­ble state be­hav­iour in cy­berspace.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion S. Iswaran, in an­nounc­ing it yes­ter­day, un­der­scored the im­por­tance of in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion in cy­ber se­cu­rity, with dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion fast-tracked by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“All our in­ter­na­tional part­ners have recog­nised the ben­e­fits of this dig­i­tal ad­vance­ment and the growth in the dig­i­tal econ­omy,” he said at a press con­fer­ence held over video­con­fer­enc­ing to wrap up Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Cy­ber Week 2020.</p>
    <p>“But equally, they’ve also em­pha­sised the need for in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion to en­sure a se­cure and trusted dig­i­tal en­vi­ron­ment that will sup­port this progress.”</p>
    <p>The Norms Im­ple­men­ta­tion Check­list ad­vances ef­forts to en­cour­age the adop­tion of a set of 11 vol­un­tary, non-bind­ing norms for re­spon­si­ble be­hav­iour in cy­berspace.</p>
    <p>Pro­posed by the UN Group of Gov­ern­men­tal Ex­perts in 2015 and en­dorsed by UN mem­ber states, the norms urge a state to take ap­pro­pri­ate mea­sures to pro­tect its crit­i­cal in­fras­truc­ture from in­fo­com­mu­ni­ca­tions and tech­nol­ogy threats, and not know­ingly sup­port ac­tiv­ity that in­ten­tion­ally dam­ages crit­i­cal in­fras­truc­ture, among other things.</p>
    <p>Mr Iswaran said the move to de­velop a check­list builds on a chart es­tab­lished by Asean last year to im­ple­ment the norms.</p>
    <p>The chart will be re­fined to ap­ply to more UN mem­ber states, tak­ing into ac­count their na­tional pri­or­i­ties and ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He added that Asean will also share its ex­pe­ri­ence and knowl­edge with the UN to en­able de­vel­op­ing na­tions in par­tic­u­lar to iden­tify the re­quired steps for im­ple­ment­ing the norms, such as putting in place le­gal frame­works and build­ing up shar­ing net­works.</p>
    <p>UN Un­der-Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral and High Rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Dis­ar­ma­ment Af­fairs Izumi Nakamitsu said at the press con­fer­ence that the check­list is an im­por­tant step to help coun­tries move from state­ments of prin­ci­ples to the more con­crete steps of im­ple­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>With the Covid-19 pan­demic forc­ing greater dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion on the world, there have also been more in­ci­dences of cy­ber at­tacks.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that some of the at­tacks have tar­geted health­care in­sti­tu­tions and re­search fa­cil­i­ties work­ing on vac­cines, Ms Nakamitsu said in re­sponse to a ques­tion: “This is pre­cisely why we need to work on the cy­ber-se­cu­rity is­sues re­ally ur­gently, whether these are state­spon­sored or not.”</p>
    <p>Pin­point­ing the at­tack­ers is very dif­fi­cult, she added. “But I think the ac­tors are ac­tu­ally multi-stake­hold­ers, they are ob­vi­ously transna­tional crim­i­nal or­gan­i­sa­tions, maybe in­di­vid­u­als.”</p>
    <p>She also said pre­vent­ing them and hold­ing them ac­count­able is es­pe­cially dif­fi­cult in cy­berspace.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, Mr Iswaran said, the num­ber of phish­ing and ran­somware at­tacks has risen in tan­dem with the on­line space be­ing used for the timely dis­sem­i­na­tion of in­for­ma­tion about Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Many of these phish­ing and ran­somware at­tacks have been us­ing Covid-19 as a hook, with scam­mers know­ing peo­ple are keen to find out what is hap­pen­ing dur­ing the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>He added that as gov­ern­ments work to ad­dress sys­temic risks, in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses can play a part by prac­tis­ing good cy­ber hy­giene, like be­ing cau­tious be­fore click­ing on links that are “too good to be true” and us­ing two-fac­tor au­then­ti­ca­tion to sign into ac­counts.</p>
    <p>NEED TO WORK TO­GETHER</p>
    <p>All our in­ter­na­tional part­ners have recog­nised the ben­e­fits of this dig­i­tal ad­vance­ment and the growth in the dig­i­tal econ­omy. But equally, they’ve also em­pha­sised the need for in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion to en­sure a se­cure and trusted dig­i­tal en­vi­ron­ment that will sup­port this progress.</p>
