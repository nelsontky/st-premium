    <p>MADRID • The preva­lence of the coro­n­avirus in Spain has risen three-fold over the past three weeks as the au­thor­i­ties strug­gle to con­tain a rash of fresh clus­ters, mainly in the Cat­alo­nia and Aragon re­gions, Health Min­istry data showed on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter reg­is­ter­ing thou­sands of cases and hun­dreds of deaths per day dur­ing an early April peak, Spain then suc­ceeded in slow­ing the num­ber of new in­fec­tions to a trickle.</p>
    <p>But since re­stric­tions on move­ment were lifted and Spa­niards eased back into daily life, some 201 new clus­ters have ap­peared, with heavy con­cen­tra­tions in and around the Cata­lan cities of Barcelona and Lleida.</p>
    <p>The oc­cur­rence of the coro­n­avirus has jumped from eight cases per 100,000 in­hab­i­tants at the end of June, when the country’s state of emergency ended, to 27 per 100,000, deputy health emergency chief Maria Sierra told a news con­fer­ence on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Over the week­end, 4,581 new cases were recorded, bring­ing the to­tal to 264,836, she added.</p>
    <p>More than 28,000 people have died.</p>
    <p>“Where mea­sures have been re­laxed is where these clus­ters ap­pear,” said Health Min­is­ter Sal­vador Illa. “We’re talk­ing about gath­er­ings of ex­tended family and spa­ces as­so­ci­ated with nightlife.”</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the sit­u­a­tion in Cat­alo­nia as a mat­ter of con­cern, he ap­pealed to residents to re­spect health mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the Cata­lan re­gional govern­ment urged some four mil­lion people, in­clud­ing residents of Spain’s sec­ond largest city, Barcelona, to stay at home and avoid gath­er­ings of more than 10 people.</p>
    <p>It also told bars and restau­rants to re­duce their ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>That was in addition to or­der­ing the manda­tory con­fine­ment of at least 160,000 people around Lleida.</p>
    <p>To pre­vent sim­i­lar out­breaks, most Span­ish re­gions have made the wear­ing of face masks com­pul­sory even when social dis­tanc­ing can be guar­an­teed.</p>
