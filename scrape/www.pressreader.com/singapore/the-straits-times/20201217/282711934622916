    <p>LON­DON • The world’s longestrun­ning tele­vi­sion soap opera, Bri­tain’s cosy work­ing-class se­ries Corona­tion Street, cel­e­brated 60 years on screen last Wed­nes­day, de­fy­ing so­cial changes and the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Peal­ing cathe­dral bells, a dis­cus­sion in Par­lia­ment and stamps fea­tur­ing char­ac­ters were among the events mark­ing the an­niver­sary.</p>
    <p>The se­ries re­volv­ing around a cor­ner shop and pub in a fic­tional town in north­ern Eng­land called Weather­field first aired on Dec 7, 1960. It was ex­pected to run for a few months, but proved an in­stant hit.</p>
    <p>Since then, the show, with its bat­tleaxe ma­tri­archs, cob­bled streets and nos­tal­gic trum­pet-led theme mu­sic, has kept its place as one of the top-rated shows on com­mer­cial chan­nel ITV.</p>
    <p>Known as Cor­rie for short, a decade ago, it be­came the world’s long­est-run­ning TV soap opera, still lag­ging be­hind the 69-year-old BBC ra­dio show The Archers.</p>
    <p>It vies for rat­ings with the BBC’s darker Easten­ders, set in a fic­tional east Lon­don bor­ough, which is a com­par­a­tive new­comer at 35.</p>
    <p>Mr John Whis­ton, head of ITV in the North, has de­scribed Corona­tion Street as “a guide to hu­man­ity with a lit­tle bit of com­fort blan­ket thrown in along with a lit­tle bit of sharp, north­ern wit”.</p>
    <p>The show’s spe­cial­ity is “strong women and feck­less men”, he said.</p>
    <p>While char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally English, the show has a global au­di­ence too, par­tic­u­larly in Canada, where it has aired on CBC since the 1960s.</p>
    <p>Corona­tion Street’s na­tion­al­trea­sure sta­tus at home has even seen it play a role in pub­lic life.</p>
    <p>Mrs Mar­garet Thatcher vis­ited the set in 1990 while she was prime min­is­ter. As the daugh­ter of a gro­cery store owner, she lam­basted the cor­ner shop for sell­ing al­co­hol, Min­is­ter for Me­dia and Data John Whit­ting­dale rem­i­nisced in Par­lia­ment last week.</p>
    <p>In 1998, the boundary be­tween fic­tion and fact blurred as Labour prime min­is­ter Tony Blair said he was or­der­ing an investigat­ion into the case of char­ac­ter Deirdre Rachid, wrong­fully jailed for fraud.</p>
    <p>In real life, Mr Blair’s fa­ther-in­law, Mr Tony Booth, was a for­mer ac­tor on the show.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics have ac­cused the show of los­ing some of its char­ac­ter and salty hu­mour and re­sort­ing to sen­sa­tional events to win rat­ings.</p>
    <p>Its dra­matic high points in­cluded a tram crash­ing off a viaduct on its 50th an­niver­sary. There have been 146 deaths, in­clud­ing 24 mur­ders.</p>
    <p>Yet, the show has won praise for ground-break­ing sto­ry­lines, in­clud­ing the first trans char­ac­ter in a Bri­tish soap opera, Hayley Crop­per, in the late 1990s.</p>
    <p>Its au­di­ence num­bers have fallen from its hey­day in the 1980s and 1990s, when top-rat­ing episodes would gain more than 20 mil­lion view­ers. Re­flect­ing a shift away from sched­uled tele­vi­sion, episodes now may have seven or eight mil­lion view­ers, in­clud­ing those watch­ing on­line.</p>
    <p>To cel­e­brate 60 years, Sal­ford Cathe­dral near where the show is filmed will ring its bell for two min­utes in mem­ory of the show’s late cre­ator Tony War­ren, who was born in the city.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic forced the soap to stop pro­duc­tion from March to June, when it be­gan pro­duc­ing so­cially dis­tanced episodes, us­ing cam­era tricks to make char­ac­ters look closer.</p>
    <p>The mak­ers ad­mit­ted they cancelled a dra­matic sto­ry­line planned for the 60th an­niver­sary be­cause the virus made it im­prac­ti­ca­ble. But The Times news­pa­per praised the stripped-back Covid-19-era show for bring­ing a “sense of real life back to sto­ry­lines”.</p>
