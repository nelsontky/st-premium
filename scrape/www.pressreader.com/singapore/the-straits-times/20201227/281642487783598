    <p>The j obs mar­ket l ooked like it would go over a cliff when the pan­demic struck, but a govern­ment ini­tia­tive that has been fine-tuned and tweaked sev­eral times over the year has proved to be a life­line.</p>
    <p>The Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) is a wage sub­sidy pro­gramme that was set up in Fe­bru­ary to help em­ploy­ers pay a por­tion of their work­ers’ monthly salary.</p>
    <p>The tim­ing was vi­tal given that peo­ple had been urged to stay at home as much as pos­si­ble, with schools, of­fices and non-es­sen­tial shops closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>But many busi­nesses were fi­nan­cially bat­tered and the spec­tre of mass lay­offs loomed.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment re­sponded with the JSS, which ini­tially funded 8 per cent of the monthly wages of ev­ery Sin­ga­porean or per­ma­nent res­i­dent em­ployee for up to three months at a cost of $1.3 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The aim was to help work­ers stay em­ployed by de­fray­ing wage costs and in turn sta­bilise and sup­port the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The scheme has since been en­hanced at least five times in line with the evolv­ing Covid-19 cri­sis, and is now ex­pected to cost more than $21.5 bil­lion once its winds up next year.</p>
    <p>The first and largest en­hance­ment came i n March, about a month af­ter it had been in­tro­duced, as it be­came clear that the pan­demic would lead to a global eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In­stead of 8 per cent, em­ploy­ers would re­ceive be­tween 25 per cent and 75 per cent in wage sub­si­dies for ev­ery lo­cal em­ployee’s monthly pay for up to nine months.</p>
    <p>The sub­sidy would also cover the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages – the me­dian wage here – up from the pre­vi­ous limit of $3,600.</p>
    <p>This meant that at least 25 per cent of the monthly wages of 1.9 mil­lion lo­cal em­ploy­ees would be funded by the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>These en­hance­ments meant the JSS would have cost about $15.1 bil­lion in to­tal, more than twice the level of sup­port pro­vided dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2009.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat an­nounced the move dur­ing the Sup­ple­men­tary Bud­get, say­ing: “We can­not pre­vent an eco­nomic re­ces­sion as the ex­ter­nal health and eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion will evolve be­yond our con­trol. But it will help us mit­i­gate the ex­tent of the down­turn and more im­por­tantly, help save jobs, and pro­tect liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>“With this sup­port from the Govern­ment, I urge em­ploy­ers to do your part to hold on to your work­ers.”</p>
    <p>Higher lev­els of sub­si­dies were re­served for harder-hit in­dus­tries. The food ser­vices sec­tor re­ceived 50 per cent of sup­port, while the avi­a­tion and tourism sec­tors re­ceived 75 per cent.</p>
    <p>The JSS was en­hanced twice in April.</p>
    <p>The first tweak came days af­ter the Govern­ment an­nounced that Sin­ga­pore would enter into a cir­cuit breaker on April 7.</p>
    <p>Firms in all sec­tors would re­ceive 75 per cent of sub­si­dies for their lo­cal em­ploy­ees for April, capped at the same level of $4,600. The pay­outs would also be given ear­lier to ease cash flow trou­bles.</p>
    <p>When it was an­nounced later that month that the cir­cuit breaker would be ex­tended by a fur­ther four weeks un­til June 1, the sub­sidy was ex­tended through May.</p>
    <p>The JSS was en­hanced again in May to ex­tend the length of sup­port from nine to 10 months of wages. More sec­tors, par­tic­u­larly those that could not re­open af­ter the end of the cir­cuit breaker, also re­ceived higher sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>As the econ­omy started to re­open in Au­gust, the JSS was ex­tended by up to seven months un­til March, a move that would lead to an out­lay of more than $21.5 bil­lion in to­tal.</p>
    <p>But the Govern­ment warned that it would not be able to sus­tain the JSS in­def­i­nitely, with the fi­nal pay­outs in June next year likely mark­ing the end of the scheme.</p>
    <p>While the JSS can be cred­ited for sav­ing jobs, an­a­lysts said, it takes more to save com­pa­nies in some hard-hit sec­tors.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy Se­lena Ling told The Sunday Times: “The JSS has likely helped to head off the worst of the lo­cal re­trench­ments ... but it is still an evolv­ing story.</p>
    <p>“If de­mand con­di­tions don’t pick up soon, some firms may still go un­der and the re­cal­i­brated JSS will only buy a bit more time.”</p>
