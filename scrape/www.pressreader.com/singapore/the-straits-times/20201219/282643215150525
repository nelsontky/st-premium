    <p>Labour MP Melvin Yong won­dered aloud yes­ter­day whether safety is tak­ing a back­seat as em­ploy­ers rush to com­plete work ahead of the year-end hol­i­day pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Are com­pa­nies trim­ming safety to re­main com­pet­i­tive?” he asked in a Face­book post, in which he also won­dered if fa­tigue from Covid-19 mea­sures has led to lapses in safety pro­cesses re­cently.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong, as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC), ex­pressed his con­cern as Sin­ga­pore pre­pares to en­ter phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore can­not af­ford to move back­ward on health and safety,” he said.</p>
    <p>He urged em­ploy­ers to take time out of their reg­u­lar op­er­a­tions to re­view and im­prove their com­pany’s safety and health pro­ce­dures and sys­tems and fix pos­si­ble lapses.</p>
    <p>Such safety time-out ex­er­cises are im­por­tant for pro­tect­ing the health and safety of work­ers, he said in his post af­ter a visit to a con­struc­tion site ear­lier in the day.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong said the im­por­tance of such ex­er­cises has been brought into sharp fo­cus re­cently, fol­low­ing the death of a 29-year-old Bangladesh­i worker at a Land Trans­port Authority work site be­side the Changi MRT de­pot. The worker was killed on Tuesday af­ter part of a sheet pile fell on him.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong added that he vis­ited a Straits Con­struc­tion Sin­ga­pore site in Tampines yes­ter­day morn­ing to bet­ter un­der­stand what it means for com­pa­nies to con­duct a safety time-out ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>“While Covid-19 has led to stop­page in terms of train­ing for work­ers in the industry, Straits Con­struc­tion has cho­sen to con­duct on­site re­train­ing and re­fresher cour­ses for work­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Its chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer, Mr Ken­neth Loo, shared that this is to en­sure work­ers are kept up to date on proper work and safety pro­cesses, which is es­pe­cially crit­i­cal given the months of lock­down may have re­sulted in lost mo­men­tum and knowl­edge.”</p>
    <p>Mr Yong also said ded­i­cated safety man­agers like Mr Don Wil­son of Straits Con­struc­tion “can make a real dif­fer­ence in achiev­ing bet­ter health and safety out­comes at the work­place, which is in­ex­tri­ca­bly linked to pro­duc­tiv­ity at the work­place”.</p>
    <p>He added: “This is dou­bly im­por­tant as em­ploy­ers bal­ance the need to min­imise the risk of widespread re-emer­gence of Covid-19 at the work­place with the need to min­imise dis­rup­tions to busi­ness op­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>He also re­minded em­ploy­ers that safety time-outs should not be a one-off ex­er­cise, and com­pa­nies can con­tact NTUC if they need help in im­ple­ment­ing such ex­er­cises.</p>
