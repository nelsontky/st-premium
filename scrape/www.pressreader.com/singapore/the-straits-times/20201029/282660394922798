    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Amer­i­can re­al­ity tele­vi­sion star Kim Kardashian faced a back­lash on Tues­day af­ter char­ter­ing a pri­vate jet to fly her en­tourage to a re­mote trop­i­cal is­land for lav­ish 40th birth­day cel­e­bra­tions dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Kardashian and her “clos­est in­ner cir­cle” spent last week danc­ing, kayak­ing and swimming with whales on a pri­vate isle where they could “pre­tend things were nor­mal just for a brief mo­ment in time”, she tweeted.</p>
    <p>The trip took the celebri­ties, in­clud­ing sis­ters Khloe and Kourt­ney and half-sis­ter Ken­dall Jen­ner, some 6,400km from Los An­ge­les to Tahiti on board a Boe­ing 777, ac­cord­ing to E! and TMZ.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, rap­per Kanye West, re­port­edly joined the party mid­way in the week.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore Covid, I don’t think any of us truly ap­pre­ci­ated what a sim­ple lux­ury it was to be able to travel and be to­gether with fam­ily and friends in a safe en­vi­ron­ment,” she wrote.</p>
    <p>But the glam­orous fes­tiv­i­ties – and Kardashian’s posts trum­pet­ing them – were im­me­di­ately con­demned as “dis­gust­ingly tonedeaf” by so­cial me­dia users at a time when the coro­n­avirus has killed more than 226,000 Amer­i­cans, and Cal­i­for­nia re­mains un­der a non-es­sen­tial travel ban.</p>
    <p>“Cool, peo­ple have had to say good­bye to loved ones over the phone while they died alone in a hos­pi­tal. but neat trip to post all over so­cial me­dia while the world suf­fers. so hum­ble and so down to earth, truly,” tweeted @JBomb11, in a post swiftly drawing 11,000 “likes”.</p>
    <p>“Are you that in­sen­si­tive you don’t re­alise this is not what the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple dur­ing the worst Covid spike yet want to hear? Peo­ple are go­ing to food banks not pri­vate is­lands,” posted Bri­tish mu­si­cian Peter Framp­ton.</p>
    <p>Kardashian said her guests had been asked to quar­an­tine for two weeks be­fore depar­ture and had un­der­gone mul­ti­ple “health screens”.</p>
    <p>She is not the first celebrity to face the wrath of so­cial me­dia users for flaunt­ing her priv­i­lege dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In March, as the United States fol­lowed much of the world into lock­down, Hol­ly­wood stars led by Won­der Woman (2017) ac­tress Gal Gadot were ridiculed for a video mon­tage of them­selves singing Imag­ine from their sprawl­ing homes.</p>
    <p>The video, in­tended to pro­vide hope, was slammed as be­ing out of touch with the lives of ev­ery­day peo­ple.</p>
