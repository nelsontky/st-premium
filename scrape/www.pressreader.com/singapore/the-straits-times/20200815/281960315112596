    <p>Mr Joe Bi­den’s se­lec­tion of Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris, the daugh­ter of a Ja­maican fa­ther and a South Asian mother, both im­mi­grants, is his­toric and in­spir­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den had an em­bar­rass­ment of riches among his op­tions. Any of the women among the top con­tenders, in­clud­ing other black and Asian women, could have been an im­pres­sive choice.</p>
    <p>But Ms Har­ris comes with the ben­e­fit of be­ing tough as nails, a true fighter and one who has al­ready been tested in this cy­cle on the trail.</p>
    <p>Still, it’s im­por­tant to as­sess not only the im­pact of her pol­icy po­si­tions and cre­den­tials, but also the cul­tural res­o­nance of her se­lec­tion. She is the first black woman in such a po­si­tion on a ma­jor party ticket, one who em­braces her mixed-race her­itage. That has im­por­tant ad­van­tages, but also some com­plex­i­ties.</p>
    <p>First, let me con­di­tion all that fol­lows by as­sert­ing this: I wish that pol­icy was the pri­mary driver of all elec­toral de­ci­sions in the US, and that per­son­al­ity, per­sonal story and pas­sions were min­i­mal con­sid­er­a­tions. But wish­ful think­ing is pre­cisely what that is. Un­for­tu­nately, sadly, the pre­sen­ta­tion of a can­di­date matters to an enor­mous de­gree in elec­tions in the United States.</p>
    <p>That said, one thing Ms Har­ris brings to the ticket is the en­thu­si­asm she gen­er­ates, and that is no small thing. One mis­step Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton made in 2016 was the se­lec­tion of Mr Tim Kaine as her run­ning mate. No mat­ter how nice a per­son he was or how strong his re­sume or how great the chem­istry was be­tween the two, his se­lec­tion as her vice-pres­i­dent plopped down like a wet rag. There was no real en­thu­si­asm around the pick.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris ar­rives with an abun­dance of en­thu­si­asm, sorely needed by Mr Bi­den, es­pe­cially among those who rel­ish in­clu­sion. She is a smart, ac­com­plished woman who will ap­peal to many other women, par­tic­u­larly when the in­evitable sex­ist at­tacks be­gin.</p>
    <p>But sex­ism is a stub­born and in­sid­i­ous thing in so­ci­ety, and the ben­e­fit the ticket gets from her be­ing a woman may be coun­ter­bal­anced by the shad­owy gen­der bias that helped un­der­mine Mrs Clin­ton.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris’ mixed-race, daugh­ter-of-im­mi­grants, in­ter­ra­cial (her hus­band is white) mar­riage story also has ap­peal, par­tic­u­larly in Amer­ica’s big lib­eral cities that at­tract many im­mi­grants. She is also mul­tira­cial at a time when num­bers of peo­ple iden­ti­fy­ing as such are on the as­cent, es­pe­cially in the west, where Ms Har­ris is from.</p>
    <p>In the south, her amaz­ing, very Amer­i­can story could find some re­sis­tance from those who look askance at it, even if they never ver­balise it. The south­ern states, with the notable ex­cep­tions of Texas and Florida, have the fewest im­mi­grants and their res­i­dents are the most op­posed to in­ter­ra­cial mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Most south­ern states aren’t swing states, but it seems to me that while vot­ing matters most within states, the amor­phous “feel­ings” peo­ple get about a can­di­date, pos­i­tive or neg­a­tive, tran­scend states and wash over the whole coun­try.</p>
    <p>As with many mixed-race peo­ple in Amer­ica, Ms Har­ris has made iden­tity choices that link her to par­tic­u­lar parts of her­self, find­ing a way to make a one­ness of twoness.</p>
    <p>She chose to at­tend a his­tor­i­cally black univer­sity and en­ter a prom­i­nent and pow­er­ful black soror­ity. This po­si­tion­ing should place her in good stead with many black peo­ple, par­tic­u­larly women. But that must be weighed against the fact that some other black peo­ple, par­tic­u­larly black men, still have real reser­va­tions over her record as a prose­cu­tor.</p>
    <p>This is some­thing to keep an eye on. Although black peo­ple as a group con­sis­tently vote over­whelm­ingly for Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates, a gap be­tween black men and black women has been grow­ing in re­cent elec­tions. Ac­cord­ing to exit polls in 2008, that gap was just</p>
    <p>1 per­cent­age point. In 2012, it was 9 per­cent­age points. In 2016, it was 12 per­cent­age points. Over that pe­riod, black women’s sup­port of the Demo­cratic can­di­date held rel­a­tively steady, from 96 per cent to 94 per cent. It was the sup­port of black men that fell ap­pre­cia­bly.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris’ record in the Se­nate has been ex­em­plary, in­clud­ing on the is­sue of so­cial jus­tice. If she were just be­ing judged by this chap­ter of her life and not the pre­vi­ous, this would all be a non-is­sue. But, of course we know, that will not be the case.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump be­lieves</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris comes with the ben­e­fit of be­ing tough as nails, a true fighter and one who has al­ready been tested in this cy­cle on the trail. Still, it’s im­por­tant to as­sess not only the im­pact of her pol­icy po­si­tions and cre­den­tials, but also the cul­tural res­o­nance of her se­lec­tion. She is the first black woman in such a po­si­tion on a ma­jor party ticket, one who em­braces her mixed-race her­itage. That has im­por­tant ad­van­tages, but also some com­plex­i­ties.</p>
    <p>that it is among black men that he can shift the maths a few per­cent­age points with his fo­cus on the econ­omy, his own steps on crim­i­nal jus­tice re­form and his de­mon­is­ing of Latin Amer­i­can im­mi­grants as threats to black pros­per­ity. Even the odd foray by rap­per Kanye West plays into this.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, it would be a mis­take to over­play a con­nec­tion be­tween the re­cent racial jus­tice and po­lice re­form pro­test­ers and Ms Har­ris. They may not be on the same page as she is. In some cases, they are on op­po­site pages. They are protest­ing against a sys­tem that Ms Har­ris was part of. Mr Bi­den, with his prob­lem­atic record on crim­i­nal jus­tice, is al­ready an is­sue.</p>
    <p>And while Ms Har­ris’ soror­ity, Al­pha Kappa Al­pha, is pow­er­ful within the black com­mu­nity, the black soror­ity and fra­ter­nity class is not al­ways aligned with the black ac­tivist class.</p>
    <p>Many civil rights lead­ers of the 1960s were mem­bers of his­tor­i­cally black fra­ter­ni­ties and soror­i­ties – Martin Luther King Jr, Ralph Aber­nathy, Jesse Jack­son, Thur­good Mar­shall. But for decades now, in­clud­ing when I was in col­lege, there has been a real ten­sion be­tween young ac­tivists and these Greek-let­ter bod­ies.</p>
    <p>Spike Lee il­lus­trated this ten­sion beau­ti­fully in his movie School Daze. The Greek-let­tered groups are seen by many as elit­ist and out of touch, not at the van­guard of the fight. (I joined one such group in col­lege.) Months of cam­paign­ing are still to come and only the elec­tion re­sult will truly tell us about the im­pact of Ms Har­ris’ se­lec­tion, but it’s wise to avoid over­sim­pli­fy­ing from the start.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris, like any politi­cian and any per­son, is com­plex and her ad­di­tion to the ticket will come with pros and cons, even among Democrats, even among black peo­ple.</p>
