    <p>There are two kinds of peo­ple in this world: Those who get ex­cited at the idea of liv­ing in recycled pack­ag­ing and those who don’t.</p>
    <p>As I step into the blue box that will be my home for the next 20 hours, I think about the voy­ages it has taken around the planet and what it has car­ried. And if I might be able to smell it.</p>
    <p>But even if my unit – wrenched from its oceanic trav­els and plonked here on a grassy patch in Ayer Ra­jah Cres­cent like a beached whale – had smelled of cook­ing oil and au­to­mo­tive parts, I would not have minded be­cause I find the idea of a ship­ping con­tainer ho­tel cool.</p>
    <p>To me, it speaks of lu­nar habi­tats, Antarc­tic re­search pods and un­der­sea bases. You know, tech chic.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, though, might not be able to get over – let’s not mince words – the ug­li­ness fac­tor: They see in its cor­ru­gated me­tal shell re­minders of con­struc­tion site of­fices, refugee hous­ing and tem­po­rary shel­ters built for sur­vival, not com­fort.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel own­ers must have had peo­ple like me in mind be­cause they have kept the out­side look­ing as con­tainer-ey as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Two cargo con­tain­ers form the ho­tel, each rented to guests separately. The orig­i­nal cargo doors work (func­tion­ing as an emer­gency exit) and the block of iden­ti­fi­ca­tion text has been left proudly on its ex­te­rior.</p>
    <p>In a de­fi­ant act of dou­bling down, they named the busi­ness the Ship­ping Con­tainer Ho­tel – they will not be body-shamed.</p>
    <p>In­side, though, it is a dif­fer­ent deal. Noth­ing about it im­plies hard­ship.</p>
    <p>At one end is the bath­room that is prop­erly plumbed, with a full-size shower cube and sink.</p>
    <p>The air is chilly from air-con­di­tion­ing and the floor, walls and ceil­ing are in sooth­ing shades of</p>
    <p>beige and off-white. With the doors shut, it is silent in­side.</p>
    <p>Still, you can’t change the laws of physics and the shape of the in­side re­flects the ge­om­e­try of the out­side.</p>
    <p>At about 26 sq m, it is larger than, say, a typ­i­cal Hong Kong shoe­box apart­ment (18.6 sq m), but that space is dis­trib­uted as it would be in</p>
    <p>a sub­ma­rine or the tubu­lar part of the star­ship USS En­ter­prise.</p>
    <p>As they say, it’s not the space you are given, it’s what you do with it. The own­ers have done a re­mark­able job mak­ing the most of the con­tainer’s long, skinny di­men­sions.</p>
    <p>The two queen-size beds, for ex­am­ple, are mur­phy beds – one folds away and be­comes a ta­ble, the other turns into a sofa fac­ing the tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>There is a tiny but com­pletely func­tional kitch­enette – with a cooker, a mi­crowave oven, a re­frig­er­a­tor and a wash­ing ma­chine.</p>
    <p>Throw open the shades of the two floor-to-ceil­ing win­dows if you are</p>
    <p>feel­ing claus­tro­pho­bic, but re­mem­ber that the struc­ture is at ground level, fac­ing a busy walk­way.</p>
    <p>Any­way, do come here for a stay­ca­tion if, like me, you think com­pact and ef­fi­cient liv­ing de­sign is ex­cit­ing and you want to ex­pe­ri­ence a night or two in a tiny home, like those fea­tured on Net­flix shows or YouTube.</p>
    <p>In­side the con­tainer, I mainly work and sleep.</p>
    <p>The two con­tain­ers that make up the ho­tel are 50 per cent booked now, so act quickly, fel­low nerds.</p>
    <p>Break­ing the il­lu­sion of liv­ing in a hu­man habi­tat on Mars is the fact that my unit faces the carpark of an</p>
    <p>in­dus­trial build­ing.</p>
    <p>It is smack dab in busy tech­topia, across the street from the onenorth MRT sta­tion and re­search and de­vel­op­ment com­plex Fu­sio­nop­o­lis, so for­get about com­ing here to get away from it all be­cause this is where the “all” is.</p>
    <p>A minute’s walk away is the Tim­bre+ food­court, which makes up for the lack of room ser­vice. Here, and Fu­sio­nop­o­lis, are where I spend most of my time out­side the con­tainer.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies with young chil­dren might want to l ook else­where un­less the kids’ idea of a good time is watch­ing tele­vi­sion all day.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, there is nowhere for par­ents to es­cape.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel is in such an odd place be­cause it is a test bed, to show that the recycled struc­tures can work as safe, live­able spa­ces.</p>
    <p>My tem­po­rary abode could one day be moved to an­other lo­ca­tion, po­ten­tially cre­at­ing new semiper­ma­nent habi­tats any­where – ones that can be pulled out, leav­ing lit­tle trace on the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>What self-re­spect­ing geek would not want a stay­ca­tion in that?</p>
    <p>HOT TIP</p>
    <p>The seafood bee hoon at the zi char stall at Tim­bre+ is worth or­der­ing.</p>
