    <p>Soldiers from the army’s Is­land De­fence Task Force (IDTF) spend far less time pa­trolling Changi Air­port these days, but they still have plenty of other roles to un­der­take.</p>
    <p>The IDTF’s com­man­der, Colonel Tan Tiong Keat, said that as flight ac­tiv­ity at Changi was “dra­mat­i­cally re­duced” dur­ing the pan­demic, not as many soldiers were needed for se­cu­rity oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>A key fac­tor was the clo­sure of Ter­mi­nal 4.</p>
    <p>“So we were able to re­de­ploy our forces to other parts of our mis­sion on the is­land which re­quired us to be con­tin­ued to be de­ployed, such as Jurong Is­land, as well as our camps and bases,” said Col Tan.</p>
    <p>IDTF soldiers have been un­der­go­ing a six-week ro­ta­tion cy­cle since the cir­cuit breaker be­gan last April – two weeks in camp, two weeks on oper­a­tions and then a two-week Stay Home Re­stric­tion Or­der.</p>
    <p>This cy­cle im­poses fire­walls be­tween teams and min­imises the im­pact on other of­fi­cers in case any­one catches the virus.</p>
    <p>“In a way, it was good tim­ing. Be­cause we went to this six-week ro­ta­tion cy­cle, it meant that in or­der to meet the same op­er­a­tional de­mands, we ac­tu­ally needed more forces,” said Col Tan.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­ral First Class (CFC) Muham­mad Nazri Mo­hamed Salleh from the IDTF said the re­duced man­power at the air­port meant some shifts were “slightly tir­ing”.</p>
    <p>But CFC Nazri, a 22-year-old full­time na­tional ser­vice­man, said he got through it with the sup­port and ca­ma­raderie of his team.</p>
