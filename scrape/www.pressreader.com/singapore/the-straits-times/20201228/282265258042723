    <p>Since March, Mr Mo­hamad Syakirin Ah­mad has spent only 15 days with his wife and two daugh­ters in Jo­hor Baru.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old Malaysian, who has been work­ing in Sin­ga­pore as a courier for three years, used to com­mute across the Causeway daily, but now has to live apart from his fam­ily, owing to the Covid-19 pan­demic and bor­der re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Syakirin was one of three for­eign worker speak­ers who shared their sto­ries yes­ter­day at a fo­rum or­gan­ised by non-profit start-up Tzu Chi Hu­man­is­tic Youth Cen­tre and co-op­er­a­tive so­ci­ety A Good Space.</p>
    <p>The other two were Ms Aminiy­ati Marthyn, 46, a do­mes­tic worker from In­done­sia, and Mr So­jib Ahmed, 28, a con­struc­tion safety co­or­di­na­tor from Bangladesh.</p>
    <p>The event at Tzu Chi Hu­man­is­tic Youth Cen­tre in Yishun was held in cel­e­bra­tion of In­ter­na­tional Mi­grants Day, which was on Dec 18, and al­lowed par­tic­i­pants to un­der­stand for­eign work­ers’ ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>The par­tic­i­pants con­sisted of mem­bers of the pub­lic as well as mi­grant work­ers and do­mes­tic work­ers. Held in a hy­brid for­mat, the fo­rum had par­tic­i­pants at the Yishun venue as well as those tun­ing in via Zoom.</p>
    <p>In June, the Tzu Chi Hu­man­is­tic Youth Cen­tre and non-profit arts com­pany 3Pump­kins, with other or­gan­i­sa­tions, launched a com­mu­nity art project called the Stay Home Quilt.</p>
    <p>It saw some 500 mi­grant work­ers who stay in dor­mi­to­ries, Malaysian work­ers and lo­cal res­i­dents in­vited to ex­press them­selves through sewing. Some of their patch­work pieces were then stitched to­gether. The works are on dis­play at the Tzu Chi Hu­man­i­ties Youth Cen­tre un­til to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Mr Syakirin was among those who took part in the project. He said he sewed the words “I love SG” and “I miss home” on his patch.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing my stay here, my friends and I re­ceived a lot of help from Sin­ga­pore­ans and NGOs (non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions) such as Ghi­fari Event Man­age­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The help we got in­cluded daily free meals, clothes, prayer equip­ment and food for break­ing fast. It eased our bur­den... I am very grate­ful for their con­tri­bu­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Louis Ng, an MP for Nee Soon GRC, at­tended the event yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He told re­porters: “The one pos­i­tive thing (about the pan­demic) is that it has re­ally shone the spot­light on the is­sues our mi­grant friends are fac­ing.</p>
    <p>“So I think it’s im­por­tant (to have) events like this, for peo­ple to hear the sto­ries di­rectly from our mi­grant friends, un­der­stand what they are going through and the dif­fi­cul­ties they are fac­ing.”</p>
