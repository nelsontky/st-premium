    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States se­na­tors have bro­ken through an im­passe over a Repub­li­can ef­fort to cur­tail the pow­ers of the Fed­eral Re­serve, clear­ing away what had been seen as the fi­nal hur­dle to a deal on a US$900 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) stim­u­lus pack­age.</p>
    <p>With time run­ning out for a com­pro­mise, Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor Pa­trick J. Toomey agreed to nar­row his ef­forts to rein in the cen­tral bank, ac­cord­ing to three aides fa­mil­iar with the dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>The three aides, speak­ing on con­di­tion of anonymity, noted that the pre­cise lan­guage was still be­ing fi­nalised.</p>
    <p>Mr Toomey had sought to bar the Fed and Trea­sury Depart­ment from set­ting up any l oan pro­gramme sim­i­lar to those es­tab­lished this year, but has not agreed to an agreed-upon al­ter­na­tive.</p>
    <p>The deal late on Satur­day was a crit­i­cal break­through for law­mak­ers who have been rac­ing to com­plete the emer­gency plan to rush di­rect pay­ments, un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits, and food and rental as­sis­tance to mil­lions of Amer­i­cans, as well as pro­vide re­lief to busi­nesses and funds for vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>While ne­go­tia­tors were still wran­gling over a num­ber of smaller is­sues, the Fed­eral Re­serve lan­guage had emerged as the thorni­est stick­ing point to a fi­nal agree­ment, be­fore the dead­line yes­ter­day evening in or­der to avoid a gov­ern­ment shut­down.</p>
    <p>“If things con­tinue on this path, and noth­ing gets in the way, we’ll be able to vote to­mor­row (Sun­day),” Demo­crat Sen­a­tor Chuck Schumer, the mi­nor­ity leader, told re­porters as he left the Capi­tol shortly be­fore mid­night on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who has been ab­sent from the fren­zied ne­go­ti­a­tions on the mea­sure, weighed in on Twit­ter, ex­hort­ing Congress to “Get it done” and pro­vide “more money in di­rect pay­ments”.</p>
    <p>The emerg­ing deal would send di­rect pay­ments of US$600 to many Amer­i­cans and pro­vide en­hanced fed­eral job­less pay­ments of US$300 per week un­til early spring.</p>
    <p>It would also pro­vide hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars to prop up small busi­nesses, schools and other in­sti­tu­tions strug­gling amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With gov­ern­ment fund­ing set to lapse yes­ter­day and both cham­bers hop­ing to merge the stim­u­lus pack­age with a catch-all mea­sure to cover all fed­eral spend­ing for the re­main­der of the fis­cal year, time was dwin­dling to fi­nalise the re­cov­ery plan and rush it to Mr Trump’s desk.</p>
    <p>With­out ac­tion by Congress, two pro­grammes de­signed to ex­pand and en­hance un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits are set to ex­pire in the com­ing days, leav­ing about 12 mil­lion Amer­i­cans with­out fed­eral sup­port.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of other ben­e­fits are set to ex­pire at the end of the year.</p>
    <p>The Fed rolled out a wide-rang­ing suite of emer­gency loan pro­grammes in re­sponse to mar­ket dis­rup­tions in March and April, and Congress al­lot­ted US$454 bil­lion to back up those ef­forts in the first pan­demic stim­u­lus law, en­acted in March.</p>
    <p>But Mr Toomey re­mained con­cerned for months that the pro­grammes might last past the end of the year. Un­der the com­pro­mise, Fed emer­gency pro­grammes would not be stopped from lend­ing to states or medium-sized busi­nesses in the fu­ture, as long as the de­sign of the pro­grammes was some­what dif­fer­ent, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>Mr Toomey had been par­tic­u­larly con­cerned that Democrats might har­ness the Fed’s pow­ers to fun­nel cheap money to state and lo­cal bor­row­ers.</p>
    <p>NEAR THE FIN­ISH LINE</p>
    <p>If things con­tinue on this path, and noth­ing gets in the way, we’ll be able to vote.</p>
