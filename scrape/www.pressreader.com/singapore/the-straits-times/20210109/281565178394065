    <p>Boe­ing will pay more than US$2.5 bil­lion (S$3.3 bil­lion) in fines and com­pen­sa­tion af­ter reach­ing a set­tle­ment with the United States Depart­ment of Jus­tice over two plane crashes that killed 346 peo­ple and led to the ground­ing of the B-737 Max. The deal caps a 21-month probe into the de­sign and devel­op­ment of the air­craft.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Boe­ing will pay more than US$2.5 bil­lion (S$3.3 bil­lion) in fines and com­pen­sa­tion af­ter reach­ing a set­tle­ment with the US Depart­ment of Jus­tice over two plane crashes that killed a to­tal of 346 peo­ple and led to the ground­ing of its 737 Max jet­liner.</p>
    <p>The set­tle­ment, which al­lows Boe­ing to avoid pros­e­cu­tion, in­cludes a fine of US$243.6 mil­lion, com­pen­sa­tion to air­lines of US$1.77 bil­lion and a US$500 mil­lion crash vic­tim fund over fraud con­spir­acy charges re­lated to the plane’s flawed de­sign.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing said it would take a US$743.6 mil­lion charge against its fourth-quar­ter 2020 earn­ings to re­flect the de­ferred pros­e­cu­tion agree­ment (DPA), a form of cor­po­rate plea bar­gain. It had put aside re­serves of US$1.77 bil­lion in prior quar­ters to pro­vide for com­pen­sa­tion to air­lines.</p>
    <p>The Jus­tice Depart­ment deal, an­nounced af­ter the mar­kets closed on Thurs­day, caps a 21-month in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the de­sign and devel­op­ment of the 737 Max fol­low­ing the two crashes, in In­done­sia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The crashes “ex­posed fraud­u­lent and de­cep­tive con­duct by em­ploy­ees of one of the world’s lead­ing com­mer­cial air­plane man­u­fac­tur­ers”, Act­ing As­sis­tant At­tor­ney­Gen­eral David Burns said in a state­ment ac­com­pa­ny­ing the deal.</p>
    <p>“Boe­ing’s em­ploy­ees chose the path of profit over can­dour by con­ceal­ing ma­te­rial in­for­ma­tion from the FAA con­cern­ing the op­er­a­tion of its 737 Max air­plane and en­gag­ing in an ef­fort to cover up their de­cep­tion,” Mr Burns added, re­fer­ring to the Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The fa­tal crashes trig­gered a hail­storm of in­ves­ti­ga­tions, saw US lead­er­ship in global avi­a­tion take a hit and have cost Boe­ing some US$20 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Lawyers rep­re­sent­ing fam­i­lies of vic­tims of the Ethiopian Air­lines crash said the set­tle­ment strength­ens civil lit­i­ga­tion against Boe­ing in Chicago, where the com­pany has its head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing has al­ready set­tled most law­suits re­lated to the Lion Air dis­as­ter in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of the crashes, the US Congress in De­cem­ber passed leg­is­la­tion re­form­ing the way the FAA cer­ti­fies new air­planes.</p>
    <p>The 737 Max was grounded in March 2019, and the mea­sure was not lifted un­til Novem­ber last year, af­ter Boe­ing had made sig­nif­i­cant safety up­grades and im­prove­ments in pi­lot train­ing.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing, the largest US air­plane man­u­fac­turer, was charged with one count of con­spir­acy to de­fraud the United States. It faces a three­year de­ferred pros­e­cu­tion agree­ment, with the charge dis­missed if it com­plies.</p>
    <p>DPAs are cor­po­rate plea bar­gains that typ­i­cally al­low a com­pany to avoid crim­i­nal charges that could dis­rupt busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties such as ac­cess to public con­tracts, in re­turn for a fine and ad­mis­sion of wrong­do­ing, as well as in­ter­nal re­forms.</p>
    <p>Boe­ing ad­mit­ted in court doc­u­ments that two of its 737 Max tech­ni­cal pi­lots had de­ceived the FAA about a safety sys­tem called MCAS, which was tied to both fa­tal crashes. The doc­u­ments also say Boe­ing be­lat­edly co­op­er­ated with the probe but only af­ter it ini­tially “frus­trated” the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>In a note to em­ploy­ees, Boe­ing’s CEO David Cal­houn said the agree­ment “ap­pro­pri­ately ac­knowl­edges how we fell short of our val­ues and ex­pec­ta­tions”.</p>
    <p>Reuters has re­ported that Boe­ing man­agers told en­gi­neers working on the Max, in­clud­ing the MCAS, that their de­signs could not trig­ger more com­pre­hen­sive train­ing des­ig­na­tions from the FAA.</p>
    <p>The de­ferred pros­e­cu­tion agree­ment says one em­ployee wrote in a note to an­other in 2014 that if the FAA re­quired higher-level train­ing it would “cost Boe­ing tens of mil­lions of dol­lars”.</p>
    <p>The US$243.6 mil­lion fine, which the Jus­tice Depart­ment said was at “low end” of the sen­tenc­ing guide­lines, rep­re­sents the amount of money Boe­ing saved by not im­ple­ment­ing full-flight sim­u­la­tor train­ing for the 737 Max, the agree­ment states.</p>
    <p>The air­line pay­ment fund will in­clude pay­ments al­ready made by Boe­ing to car­ri­ers which had to can­cel flights due to a short­age of air­craft.</p>
