    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW­CAS­TLE (Aus­tralia) Un­der­pres­sure All Blacks coach Ian Fos­ter was a re­lieved man after his side clicked into gear in their fi­nal Tri-Na­tions match yes­ter­day to rout Ar­gentina 38-0 and all but se­cure the ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The three-time world cham­pi­ons opened their cam­paign with a record 43-5 win over Aus­tralia, but Fos­ter had come un­der im­mense scru­tiny after his side’s 24-22 loss to the Wal­la­bies in the re­turn match, fol­lowed by a first Test de­feat by the Pu­mas.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the vic­tory yes­ter­day, the</p>
    <p>All Blacks were fac­ing the prospect of los­ing three in a row for the first time in more than 20 years.</p>
    <p>“The loss two weeks ago still hurts but tonight will go a long way to fix that,” Fos­ter said, wip­ing his sweaty brow on a hot night at the McDon­ald Jones Sta­dium in New­cas­tle, north of Sydney.</p>
    <p>“It was still a tough Test and it took a long time to break them down. I just loved the pa­tience.</p>
    <p>“We made them make a lot of tack­les and, in th­ese con­di­tions, they paid a price. It cer­tainly opened up in that last quar­ter, which is what we ex­pected.”</p>
    <p>The win all but se­cured the sil­ver­ware for New Zealand, who have 11 points from four games.</p>
    <p>Ar­gentina play Aus­tralia next week and ei­ther side could fea­si­bly edge them out, but it would take a bonus-point win and by a huge mar­gin given New Zealand’s vastly su­pe­rior points dif­fer­en­tial.</p>
    <p>Fos­ter had made only three changes to the start­ing side who lost 25-15 to Ar­gentina, and he was re­warded with a far more ma­ture and dis­ci­plined per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>“We just didn’t lose be­lief in what we were do­ing,” he added.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a big few weeks but the guys are still de­ter­mined to play, and I think we got the for­mula right today.”</p>
    <p>The All Blacks dom­i­nated the first half, go­ing into the break 10-0 ahead, but there were also missed op­por­tu­ni­ties with two tries dis­al­lowed.</p>
    <p>But two tries in quick suc­ces­sion from young full-back Will Jor­dan in the fi­nal quar­ter sealed the vic­tory and a cru­cial bonus point for win­ning by three tries or more.</p>
    <p>The de­feat for Ar­gentina proved ex­tra painful for Mario Ledesma’s men, who were hop­ing to lift the spir­its of their na­tion after foot­ball leg­end Diego Maradona’s death aged 60 on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>New Zealand skip­per Sam Cane laid an All Blacks jersey em­bla­zoned with Maradona’s name and shirt num­ber, 10, in the cen­tre cir­cle ahead of the kick-off as a mark</p>
    <p>A FORCE FOR UNITY</p>
    <p>I think he’s a leg­end for ev­ery­body, but in Ar­gentina he was al­most a god. He had the ca­pac­ity of get­ting ev­ery­body to­gether so we will miss him</p>
    <p>MARIO LEDESMA, Ar­gentina coach, on foot­ball leg­end Diego Maradona.</p>
    <p>of re­spect.</p>
    <p>Ledesma felt his team had their chances to main­tain their fairy­tale run after back­ing up their win over the All Blacks with a 15-15 draw against Aus­tralia last week.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing played all but fault­less rugby two weeks ago, how­ever, the Pu­mas turned over the ball al­most every time they had a chance to put pres­sure on their op­po­nents yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“A lot of mis­takes, a lot of drop balls,” Ledesma said. “It’s dif­fi­cult to be ob­jec­tive but I don’t think the score re­flects the game.</p>
    <p>“We have a big one next week and we’re re­ally con­scious of that and re­ally com­mit­ted to hav­ing a great game.”</p>
