    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Ap­ple has pur­chased Cherry, the first film di­rected by the Russo broth­ers since their all-time record gross­ing Avengers: Endgame (2019), in a ma­jor deal ex­pected to boost the new stream­ing ser­vice’s Os­car hopes.</p>
    <p>The opi­oid cri­sis drama from An­thony and Joe Russo, star­ring Spi­der-Man (2017, 2019) ac­tor Tom Hol­land, will de­but on Ap­ple TV+ early next year. It is also ex­pected to have a lim­ited run in the­atres.</p>
    <p>Based on Nico Walker’s semi­au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal novel, Cherry fol­lows a for­mer United States Army medic who falls into ad­dic­tion and crime af­ter re­turn­ing from Iraq with ex­treme un­di­ag­nosed post­trau­matic stress dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple pur­chased the com­pleted film from the Rus­sos’ pro­duc­tion com­pany in a deal re­port­edly worth more than US$40 mil­lion (S$55 mil­lion). Nei­ther party has pub­licly con­firmed that fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at last year’s Comic-Con fan con­ven­tion, the film-mak­ing broth­ers de­scribed the project as a “ma­ture” and “com­pli­cated” look at the US opi­oid cri­sis set in their home­town of Cleve­land, Ohio.</p>
    <p>“It’s touched our fam­i­lies, the cri­sis, so it’s a deeply per­sonal movie for us,” said An­thony at the time.</p>
    <p>“Joe and I are now in a po­si­tion now where we can get those movies made, and we want to use that sort of cap­i­tal that we built up,” he added.</p>
    <p>The broth­ers di­rected four Mar­vel su­per­hero movies, three of which grossed more than US$1 bil­lion. Their fourth, Avengers: Endgame, last year sur­passed Avatar (2009) to seize the all-time box-of­fice record of US$2.798 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The deal puts Ap­ple TV+, which launched last Novem­ber, in the race for an un­usual awards sea­son.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has seen ma­jor pro­duc­tions de­layed, and the­atri­cal re­leases post­poned by a year or more, po­ten­tially ben­e­fit­ing stream­ing plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Hol­ly­wood’s mo­tion pic­ture academy pushed back the Os­cars by two months to al­low more films to com­pete.</p>
    <p>It eased some el­i­gi­bil­ity rules, al­low­ing movies that skip the big screen and ap­pear on stream­ing plat­forms to con­tend this time around.</p>
