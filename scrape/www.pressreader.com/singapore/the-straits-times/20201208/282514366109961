    <p>When Tai­wan be­came the first place in Asia to le­galise same-sex mar­riage last year, film-maker Cheng Yu-chieh was in the midst of writ­ing the script for his gaythemed family film, Dear Ten­ant.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old Tai­wanese, who pre­vi­ously acted in dra­mas such as Po­lice Et Vous (2008), says over a video call to lo­cal me­dia that the rul­ing does not mean the road to ac­cep­tance for same-sex cou­ples is com­plete.</p>
    <p>He says in Man­darin: “Two peo­ple get­ting mar­ried doesn’t mean it’s hap­pily ever af­ter. Mar­riage is so much about two fam­i­lies rather than two in­di­vid­u­als and gets even more com­pli­cated with chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“I think chang­ing hearts and minds in some ways is more im­por­tant than chang­ing laws. Do peo­ple un­der­stand and tol­er­ate other ways of liv­ing and lov­ing?”</p>
    <p>Dear Ten­ant, which is show­ing in cin­e­mas, tells the story of a gay man who con­tin­ues to take care of his part­ner’s mother and son af­ter his part­ner’s death.</p>
    <p>Cheng, who is mar­ried with three chil­dren, says writ­ing a gay ro­mance as a straight man was no big deal. “I’m sure gay men can write straight ro­mances too. Ul­ti­mately, the film ex­am­ines what family means and what makes love, love.”</p>
    <p>Aside from writ­ing and di­rect­ing, he also put NT$13 mil­lion (S$613,000) of his own money into the film.</p>
    <p>His ef­forts paid off. Dear Ten­ant won lead­ing man Mo Tzu-yi Best Lead­ing Ac­tor and vet­eran ac­tress Chen Shu-fang Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress, as well as Best Orig­i­nal Film Score at the Golden Horse Awards last month.</p>
    <p>The pres­tige boosted the film’s box of­fice and took it past the NT$30 mil­lion mark in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>To cel­e­brate the achieve­ment, Cheng put up deleted clips from the movie on YouTube, in­clud­ing an in­ti­mate scene be­tween Mo and Yao Chun-yao, who plays his part­ner.</p>
    <p>The most sex­u­ally ex­plicit scene which made it into the film – which is rated R21 in Sin­ga­pore – is of Mo’s cathar­tic en­counter in a mo­tel with ac­tor Wang Ko-yuan. Cheng says: “Mo is to­tally okay with go­ing nude. As a the­atre ac­tor, he’s done full-frontal nu­dity on­stage be­fore. But, of course, we kept the crew on set to a bare min­i­mum out of re­spect for the ac­tors. “We did a lot of the scene in one long shot. One take is ac­tu­ally over 10 min­utes long. I just let them per­form and nav­i­gate the scene be­tween them­selves.”</p>
    <p>The writer-di­rec­tor has been per­son­ally af­fected by his film, even once break­ing into tears on set, dur­ing a scene where child star Pai Jun-yin feeds his grand­mother (Chen) pills. “It just felt so real, it didn’t feel like act­ing at all,” he says.</p>
    <p>Pai may just be the break­out star of Dear Ten­ant, de­spite not be­ing nom­i­nated at the Golden Horse Awards. The 11-year-old, who is of Tai­wanese-Ja­panese de­scent, was as pro­fes­sional as an adult and spoke di­rectly to Cheng when he had con­cerns about his role.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate in­ter­view, Chen, 81, sim­i­larly heaped praise on Pai, call­ing him “an act­ing ge­nius”.</p>
    <p>“He can speak his lines so smoothly. And it’s not as if he’s a pre­co­cious kid. The deft­ness of his per­for­mance is just re­ally im­pres­sive,” she says.</p>
    <p>With 63 years of act­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, Chen has had time to hone her craft.</p>
    <p>She was recog­nised for the first time at the re­cent Golden Horse Awards when she bagged both Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress, for Dear Ten­ant, and Best Lead­ing Ac­tress for family film Lit­tle Big Women.</p>
    <p>She says she has hardly had time to cel­e­brate as she has been busy pro­mot­ing both movies fol­low­ing her win.</p>
    <p>The sprightly star has had her share of ups and downs in life, in­clud­ing get­ting conned out of most of her as­sets by a friend, di­vorce and a one-year pe­riod when projects dried up. And she is look­ing for­ward to more ups.</p>
    <p>She says with a laugh: “I still want more. Hope­fully, next year I’ll have an­other good project that’ll land me an­other nom­i­na­tion. Is that too greedy?”</p>
