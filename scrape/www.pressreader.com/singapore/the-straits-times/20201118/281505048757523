    <p>Lux­ury watch re­tailer Cortina Hold­ings, which car­ries well­known brands such as Rolex and Patek Philippe, has pro­posed to ac­quire ri­val Sin­cere Watch for $84.5 mil­lion in cash.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed ac­qui­si­tion will pro­vide Cortina with exclusive dis­trib­u­tor­ship rights to the Franck Muller brand in 12 coun­tries within the Asia-Pa­cific, said the main­board-listed com­pany in an ex­change fil­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Shares of Cortina rose to close 3.86 per cent higher at $2.15 yes­ter­day, af­ter trad­ing as much as 11 per cent up af­ter the an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­cere Watch, founded in 1954, op­er­ates 18 bou­tiques, with a port­fo­lio in­clud­ing Omega, Aude­mars Piguet, Pan­erai and Tu­dor.</p>
    <p>It runs multi-brand re­tail out­lets un­der the Sin­cere brand in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, and un­der the Pen­du­lum brand in Thai­land. In ad­di­tion, it runs bou­tiques for Franck Muller in Sin­ga­pore and Aus­tralia, A. Lange & Sohne in Malaysia, as well as A. Lange & Sohne, Bre­itling and IWC in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>Cortina, on the other hand, started out as a small watch shop in 1972 at Colombo Court. To­day, it has over 20 bou­tiques across Asia, in­clud­ing Malaysia, In­done­sia, Thai­land and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The deal will give Cortina ac­cess to Sin­cere’s arse­nal of brands, which can be dis­trib­uted across 40 com­bined out­lets and create op­er­a­tional syn­er­gies, said Cortina in yes­ter­day’s fil­ing.</p>
    <p>The ac­qui­si­tion will in­clude Sin­cere Watch’s sev­eral sub­sidiaries and an as­so­ci­ated com­pany.</p>
    <p>The pur­chase price of $84.5 mil­lion rep­re­sents a dis­count of about 0.2 per cent from the net tan­gi­ble as­sets of the tar­get group – Sin­cere Watch, its sub­sidiaries and the as­so­ci­ated com­pany – as at June 30.</p>
    <p>Cortina in­tends to raise around 60 per cent of the sum from bank bor­row­ings, and the re­main­der through in­ter­nal re­sources.</p>
    <p>As at Sept 30, the Cortina group had $279.3 mil­lion in cur­rent as­sets, in­clud­ing $122.3 mil­lion in cash and bank bal­ances. It had cur­rent li­a­bil­i­ties of $74.9 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Cortina recorded a net profit of $39.3 mil­lion for its financial year ended March this year. Ac­cord­ing to yes­ter­day’s fil­ing, Sin­cere Watch in­curred a net loss of $6.4 mil­lion for its 2020 financial year.</p>
    <p>The $84.5 mil­lion pur­chase price also rep­re­sents 25 per cent of Cortina’s mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion based on a share price of $2.04 – the weighted av­er­age price of shares trans­acted last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed ac­qui­si­tion con­sti­tutes a ma­jor trans­ac­tion un­der list­ing rules, thus re­quir­ing Cortina share­hold­ers’ ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Cortina said it has re­ceived ir­rev­o­ca­ble un­der­tak­ings from share­hold­ers rep­re­sent­ing more than 50 per cent of the vot­ing rights to vote in favour of the deal.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed ac­qui­si­tion would mark the fourth change of own­er­ship for Sin­cere Watch.</p>
    <p>It was first sold by the founder’s son Tay Liam Wee in 2007 to nowde­funct Hong Kong fash­ion and lux­ury watch re­tailer Peace Mark Hold­ings at $530 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Two years later, a con­sor­tium in­clud­ing Mr Tay bought back the watch re­tailer at $112.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The com­pany was sub­se­quently sold to Hong Kong busi­ness­woman Pollyanna Chu in 2012 for $232 mil­lion, with Sin­cere Watch (Hong Kong) later carved out and listed.</p>
    <p>Sin­cere Watch owns 5.39 per cent of Sin­cere Watch (Hong Kong) as at end-March, ac­cord­ing to the Hong Kong-listed firm’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The com­ple­tion of the pro­posed ac­qui­si­tion is con­di­tional upon Sin­cere Watch dis­pos­ing of its en­tire le­gal and ben­e­fi­cial in­ter­ests in Sin­cere Watch (Hong Kong) to an en­tity wholly owned by Mrs Chu, said Cortina in yes­ter­day’s fil­ing.</p>
