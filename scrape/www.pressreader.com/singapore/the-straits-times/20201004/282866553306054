    <p>When it comes to house­work, com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager Ho Kai Xin and her hus­band di­vide the chores ac­cord­ing to abil­ity and pref­er­ence, not gen­der.</p>
    <p>They do their best to treat each other with re­spect and check each other’s bi­ases. And they hope their two-month-old son picks up these traits when he grows up.</p>
    <p>The best way to teach gen­der equal­ity is to “model your be­liefs at home”, said Mrs Ho, 30.</p>
    <p>“A for­mal school cur­ricu­lum at best pro­vides an al­ter­na­tive view­point but fam­ily, I be­lieve, will be the main de­ter­mi­nant in what a child grows up think­ing,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mrs Ho is among a grow­ing num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­ans who have left be­hind out­dated stereo­types about women be­ing the ones who must bear the brunt of house­hold and care-giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>And they are de­ter­mined to en­sure that the next gen­er­a­tion is not pi­geon­holed into gen­der stereo­types.</p>
    <p>Last month, Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam an­nounced a com­pre­hen­sive re­view of is­sues af­fect­ing women.</p>
    <p>Sparked in part by in­ci­dents of voyeurism on univer­sity cam­puses, the re­view will seek to in­stil gen­der equal­ity as a fun­da­men­tal value that is in­ter­nalised by boys and girls from a young age, he said.</p>
    <p>It will be led by Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment and Education Sun Xuel­ing, Min­is­ter of State for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth and Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling, and Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health Ra­hayu Mahzam.</p>
    <p>The re­view will in­volve dia­logues with ex­perts and pro­fes­sion­als, in­clud­ing women’s and youth groups, to col­lect feed­back and rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>The ideas gath­ered through this process will form the ba­sis of a White Pa­per to be tabled in Par­lia­ment in the first half of next year, Mr Shan­mugam said.</p>
    <p>The re­view is ex­pected to be a “whole of so­ci­ety” ex­er­cise, but to my mind, par­ents will need to play the big­gest role in the process – be­fore, dur­ing and after the for­mu­la­tion of new poli­cies.</p>
    <p>A key plank in the move for gen­der equal­ity should be broad­en­ing sex education and help­ing chil­dren un­der­stand, for in­stance, what sex­ual of­fences are, and how they are a vi­o­la­tion of fun­da­men­tal val­ues.</p>
    <p>Mod­el­ling gen­der-equal be­hav­iour is one way to bust stereo­types for chil­dren who watch and learn closely from their par­ents at home.</p>
    <p>How­ever, boost­ing re­spect for women in so­ci­ety goes be­yond house­work. It will re­quire par­ents to start dis­cussing with chil­dren is­sues such as sex­u­al­ity, re­la­tion­ships, and the idea of con­sent and per­sonal bound­aries.</p>
    <p>That is when things get awk­ward for fam­i­lies steeped in Asian norms.</p>
    <p>Like many chil­dren grow­ing up in an Asian home, I shied away from dis­cussing such top­ics openly with my par­ents. How­ever, stud­ies have shown that par­ents play a key role in help­ing to cre­ate an en­vi­ron­ment where chil­dren feel safe talk­ing freely about any­thing and ev­ery­thing, in­clud­ing the birds and the bees.</p>
    <p>The As­so­ci­a­tion of Women for Ac­tion and Re­search (Aware) and in­de­pen­dent re­search agency Black­box Re­search – in a re­cent sur­vey of 564 par­ents – found that 57 per cent were com­fort­able dis­cussing with their chil­dren mat­ters re­lated to sex­ual health.</p>
    <p>About half of those polled said they were com­fort­able dis­cussing ro­man­tic and in­ti­mate re­la­tion­ships, and 49 per cent felt com­fort­able dis­cussing sex.</p>
    <p>When asked to ex­plain their dis­com­fort, more than 25 per cent cited em­bar­rass­ment and a lack of con­fi­dence, as well as the lack of ap­pro­pri­ate tools.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist Cherie Chan from Thrive Clinic said Asian par­ents tend to fo­cus on things such as grades and achieve­ments, with dat­ing and sex seen as less im­por­tant, and even dis­tract­ing at times.</p>
    <p>When chil­dren be­come cu­ri­ous about sex and re­la­tion­ships, and they do not feel safe speak­ing to their par­ents, it is cause for con­cern, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Ms Aarti Mun­dae, di­rec­tor of In­con­tact Coun­selling and Train­ing, said it is best not to leave chil­dren to ex­plore these is­sues on their own.</p>
    <p>Adept at nav­i­gat­ing the Web, chil­dren will look for in­for­ma­tion on­line, she said, not­ing that their search could lead to porno­graphic por­tals which can of­fer young minds a “dys­func­tional view of in­ti­macy and gen­der roles”.</p>
    <p>Only a trust­wor­thy adult can help them nav­i­gate and fil­ter out any harm­ful in­for­ma­tion, Ms Mun­dae added.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren also need to have prin­ci­ples such as con­sent, mu­tual re­spect and au­ton­omy bro­ken down into eas­ily di­gestible ideas and ex­plained to them at an early age.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Joo Hymn – the fa­cil­i­ta­tor for Aware’s Birds and Bees work­shop, which aims to help par­ents talk openly with their chil­dren – said “com­pre­hen­sive sex education should chal­lenge young peo­ple’s think­ing on gen­der roles”.</p>
    <p>“We have to stop think­ing about sex education as just fo­cus­ing on ab­sti­nence... It’s just as, if not more, im­por­tant to teach con­sent – what it looks like, how to ask for it, and how to re­spond when the an­swer is ‘no’.”</p>
    <p>Ms Mun­dae said cul­ture, so­cioe­co­nomic and re­li­gious fac­tors can in­flu­ence how open par­ents are to ed­u­cat­ing their chil­dren on mat­ters of sex­u­al­ity and sex.</p>
    <p>Schools can step in to fill the gap. Ms Tan said the Education Min­istry has taken some pro­gres­sive steps in the past few years, such as amend­ing the sex education syl­labus to dial down the fo­cus on sub­jects like ab­sti­nence.</p>
    <p>Some ar­eas could be “more com­pre­hen­sively ad­dressed”, in­clud­ing gen­der bias and sex­ual vi­o­lence, par­tic­u­larly emerg­ing is­sues such as dig­i­tal voyeurism and non-con­sen­sual dis­tri­bu­tion of images, she added.</p>
    <p>Na­tional In­sti­tute of Education don Jason Tan said that be­yond the aca­demic cur­ricu­lum, chil­dren also form im­pres­sions of gen­der roles through their teach­ers’ day-to-day be­hav­iour and ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“Chil­dren need to be con­sciously think­ing about what goes on in the world around them. Who gets picked to an­swer ques­tions in class, who gets cho­sen for lead­er­ship roles, who gets told to be­have more gen­tly and less roughly?” he said.</p>
    <p>The re­view Sin­ga­pore is em­bark­ing on now is a sign that as a so­ci­ety, we are ready to widen the con­tours of gen­der equal­ity first mapped out by the Women’s Char­ter in 1961.</p>
    <p>As a woman, I am thank­ful for the priv­i­lege of hav­ing grown up in Sin­ga­pore, with little worry for my safety when I walk home alone at night.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is more that can be done. My hope is that the next gen­er­a­tion of young women will feel safe speak­ing up about how their stand­ing can be made more equal in so­ci­ety, and their con­tri­bu­tions bet­ter val­ued.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it is not just about their out­ward achieve­ments, but also the in­equal­i­ties in the nu­ances of daily life – from bi­ases in gen­der roles to the dis­tri­bu­tion of house­hold re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, and more.</p>
    <p>The con­ver­sa­tions needed to bring about change must start at home, and spill into schools and work­places so that women can truly be­come equal part­ners in build­ing a bet­ter Sin­ga­pore for the fu­ture.</p>
