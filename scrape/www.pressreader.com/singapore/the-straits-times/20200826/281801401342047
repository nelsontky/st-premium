    <p>CHICAGO/NEW YORK • The US gov­ern­ment’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert, Dr An­thony Fauci, is warn­ing that dis­tribut­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine un­der spe­cial emer­gency use guide­lines be­fore it has been proven safe and ef­fec­tive in large tri­als is a bad idea that could have a chill­ing ef­fect on the test­ing of other vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists and health ex­perts have ex­pressed con­cern that Amer­i­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump will ap­ply pres­sure on the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) to de­liver a vac­cine be­fore Novem­ber to boost his chances of re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci, di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases, de­clined to com­ment on Mr Trump, but said there are risks in rush­ing out a vac­cine de­spite the ur­gent need.</p>
    <p>“The one thing that you would not want to see with a vac­cine is get­ting an EUA (emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion) be­fore you have a sig­nal of ef­fi­cacy,” he told Reuters in a tele­phone in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“One of the po­ten­tial dan­gers if you pre­ma­turely let a vac­cine out is that it would make it dif­fi­cult, if not im­pos­si­ble, for the other vac­cines to en­rol peo­ple in their trial.”</p>
    <p>Large-scale clin­i­cal tri­als of the lead­ing vac­cine can­di­dates from Moderna, Pfizer and As­traZeneca, which aim to en­rol tens of thou­sands of vol­un­teers, were launched in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Johnson & Johnson last week said it hopes to in­clude 60,000 sub­jects in its Phase III vac­cine trial.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump stoked con­cerns of politi­cis­ing the reg­u­la­tory ap­proval process with an an­nounce­ment on Sun­day of an emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion for plasma from re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients to treat cur­rent pa­tients be­fore its ben­e­fits have been as­sessed in ran­domised, clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>He tweeted last Saturday that “deep state” el­e­ments at the FDA were de­lay­ing progress on drugs and vac­cines un­til af­ter the Nov 3 elec­tion in or­der to hurt his re-elec­tion bid.</p>
    <p>Safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cines are seen as es­sen­tial to end­ing the pan­demic that has claimed the lives of more than 800,000 peo­ple world­wide, over 177,000 of them in the United States.</p>
    <p>But vac­cine ex­perts worry that the White House may ap­ply pres­sure on the FDA to push out a vac­cine via an EUA be­fore it has been tested fully – a path­way that has never been used to ap­prove a vac­cine in­tended for wide­spread use.</p>
    <p>Dr Peter Hotez, an in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert and vac­cine re­searcher at Bay­lor Col­lege of Medicine, said: “I would be very wor­ried about us­ing an EUA mech­a­nism for some­thing like a vac­cine. It’s very dif­fer­ent from plasma ther­apy.”</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci said the FDA’s guidance on vac­cines – both for full ap­proval and for an EUA – ex­plic­itly re­quires a demon­stra­tion that they are both safe and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>An EUA is typ­i­cally used for prod­ucts to “di­ag­nose, pre­vent and treat se­ri­ous or life-threat­en­ing dis­eases where the known ben­e­fits out­weigh the po­ten­tial risks of the prod­uct”, he added. An EUA might be ap­pro­pri­ate once stud­ies have shown safety and ef­fec­tive­ness, but be­fore the FDA has com­pleted its for­mal review of the com­pany’s mar­ket­ing ap­pli­ca­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>“To me, it’s ab­so­lutely para­mount that you defini­tively show that a vac­cine is safe and ef­fec­tive, both,” Dr Fauci said.</p>
    <p>“We would hope that noth­ing in­ter­feres with the full demon­stra­tion that a vac­cine is safe and ef­fec­tive.” placebo-con­trolled</p>
