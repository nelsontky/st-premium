    <p>•</p>
    <p>Uber Tech­nolo­gies is seek­ing to sell part of its US$6.3 bil­lion (S$8.5 bil­lion) stake in China’s Didi Chux­ing, as it be­gins to shed mi­nor­ity hold­ings to raise cash, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The San Fran­cisco-based ride-hail­ing pi­o­neer is be­gin­ning to mon­e­tise stakes in other firms in an ef­fort to boost its own share price, the peo­ple said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause the dis­cus­sions are pri­vate.</p>
    <p>Uber shares were down about 3 per cent on Thurs­day in New York to US$36.41, well be­low the US$45 at which it went public last May.</p>
    <p>Uber chief ex­ec­u­tive Dara Khos­row­shahi is in dis­cus­sions about the sale with Didi and SoftBank Group, the Ja­panese con­glom­er­ate that is a ma­jor share­holder in both com­pa­nies, the peo­ple said.</p>
    <p>While var­i­ous sce­nar­ios are un­der dis­cus­sion, one op­tion is for</p>
    <p>SoftBank to team up with other in­vestors to ac­quire a mi­nor­ity of Uber’s 15 per cent stake, one per­son said. Didi, which needs to ap­prove any sale, is un­likely to buy shares it­self, an­other per­son said.</p>
    <p>An Uber spokesman and Didi de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The Didi sale would be the latest di­vesti­ture by Uber de­signed to con­sol­i­date op­er­a­tions and aban­don once sprawl­ing global am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>This month, it agreed to sell its Euro­pean freight busi­ness and some of its stock in Rus­sia’s Yan­dex.</p>
    <p>The firm is also ne­go­ti­at­ing to sell some of its stake in Grab, Bloomberg News has re­ported.</p>
    <p>Didi’s val­u­a­tion hit US$56 bil­lion as ride-hail­ing boomed, but its shares have slid in pri­vate mar­ket trans­ac­tions amid reg­u­la­tory trou­bles and the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Uber wrote down its Didi stake to US$6.3 bil­lion from US$8.2 bil­lion in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>One is­sue may be de­ter­min­ing the cur­rent value of those hold­ings.</p>
    <p>In sec­ondary mar­ket trans­ac­tions, sell­ers are look­ing to get at least the equiv­a­lent of a US$33 bil­lion val­u­a­tion for their Didi shares, while buy­ers are seek­ing prices be­low that level.</p>
    <p>The San Fran­cisco-based ride-hail­ing pi­o­neer is be­gin­ning to mon­e­tise stakes in other firms in an ef­fort to boost its own share price, the peo­ple said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause the dis­cus­sions are pri­vate.</p>
