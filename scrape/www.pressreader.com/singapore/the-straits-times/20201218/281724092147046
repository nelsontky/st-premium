    <p>There were 24 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, all of which were im­ported.</p>
    <p>This is the high­est num­ber of im­ported cases since March 28, when there were 42. This takes the to­tal num­ber of cases here to 58,377.</p>
    <p>The lat­est cases were placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>One of the im­ported cases is a crew mem­ber of a ship that ar­rived from In­done­sia. The spe­cial pass holder did not dis­em­bark from the ship and was taken to hospi­tal in an am­bu­lance af­ter he de­vel­oped symp­toms on Dec 10.</p>
    <p>The im­ported cases in­clude 13 Sin­ga­pore­ans or per­ma­nent res­i­dents who came back from Aus­tria, In­dia, In­done­sia, Myan­mar and the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing cases are four work pass or work per­mit hold­ers who are cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, five de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers and a stu­dent’s pass holder.</p>
    <p>The work pass and work per­mit hold­ers ar­rived from In­dia, In­done­sia and the Mal­dives, while the de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers came from the United King­dom.</p>
    <p>MOH said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with no new cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>With 14 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,237 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 33 pa­tients re­mained in hospi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, and 63 pa­tients were still re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break, which be­gan in De­cem­ber last year, has in­fected more than 73.4 mil­lion peo­ple. More than 1.6 mil­lion peo­ple have died.</p>
    <p>MOH said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with no new cases in the past week.</p>
