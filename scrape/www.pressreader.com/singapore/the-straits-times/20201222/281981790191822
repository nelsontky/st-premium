    <p>While full de­tails are yet to be known, the hos­tile cy­ber at­tack ef­fected through the So­larWinds sup­ply chain is clearly the most vir­u­lent in re­cent mem­ory, and book­ends a year when a ma­lig­nant virus of an­other sort, the one that causes Covid-19, has dom­i­nated head­lines. Ac­cord­ing to the Texas-based soft­ware com­pany, the at­tack­ers com­pro­mised a server used to build up­dates for one of its plat­forms that sup­port IT in­fra­struc­ture man­age­ment. Au­da­ciously, they used this com­pro­mised server be­tween March and June to insert back­door mal­ware into the prod­ucts of lead­ing com­pa­nies such as Mi­crosoft. In­sti­tu­tions tar­geted in­clude the United States’ Trea­sury, State and Home­land Se­cu­rity de­part­ments.</p>
    <p>So­larWinds has said 18,000 cus­tomers down­loaded the tam­pered soft­ware up­dates. The US Cy­ber­se­cu­rity and In­fra­struc­ture Se­cu­rity Agency called it a “grave risk” to fed­eral, state and lo­cal gov­ern­ments, as well as crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture and the pri­vate sec­tor. Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo and the US Na­tional Se­cu­rity Agency have blamed Rus­sian state-spon­sored ma­li­cious cy­ber ac­tors for the at­tack, which was con­sid­ered so se­ri­ous that it prompted Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Robert O’Brien to cut short an over­seas trip and re­turn to over­see daily cri­sis meet­ings at the White House.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber at­tacks are no longer a sur­prise. Ev­ery wor­thy power has the ca­pa­bil­ity to carry them out in some form or other, and in some ways it is a corol­lary to the abil­ity to snoop on every­thing from kitchen con­ver­sa­tions to the most se­cret strate­gic plans of gov­ern­ments and global or­gan­i­sa­tions. This year, in the race to find a vac­cine, the pan­demic has brought at­tempts to even hack into the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the lat­est out­rage in­volv­ing So­larWinds is no­table not only for its stealth and cun­ning but also for the wor­ry­ing thought of what could have been. Among the tar­gets hit were the US nu­clear weapons agency. What if some fiendish mind or­ches­trated false alarms that had the po­ten­tial to set off a nu­clear re­sponse?</p>
    <p>The world faces a mo­ment of reck­on­ing in cy­ber se­cu­rity. Sig­nif­i­cant in­tel­li­gence-shar­ing on cy­ber ac­tiv­i­ties and stepped-up co­or­di­na­tion be­tween the gov­ern­ment and pri­vate sec­tor play­ers are needed as fresh threats loom. For in­stance, the emer­gence of cy­ber mer­ce­nar­ies or PSOAs, for pri­vate sec­tor of­fen­sive ac­tors. US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den has vowed to work with al­lies and im­pose “sub­stan­tial costs” on those re­spon­si­ble for the So­larWinds hack. Al­most cer­tainly, this will fuel the ef­forts to de­cou­ple the tech­nol­ogy world. How­ever, if any­thing, this is the time for ma­jor pow­ers to sit down and can­didly ex­change threat per­cep­tions and dis­cuss ways to mit­i­gate things. This is an is­sue that may even need to be han­dled at the level of the United Na­tions.</p>
