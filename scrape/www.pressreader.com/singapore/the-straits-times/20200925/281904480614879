    <p>SAN RA­MON (Cal­i­for­nia) • Chevron has asked its global em­ploy­ees to re­move Ten­cent Hold­ings’ WeChat from their work phones, mak­ing it one of the first United States com­pa­nies to heed the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s ex­ec­u­tive or­der ban­ning the Chi­nese so­cial app over al­leged na­tional se­cu­rity risks.</p>
    <p>The oil gi­ant iden­ti­fied WeChat as a “non­com­pli­ant ap­pli­ca­tion”, ask­ing those who in­stalled the app on their work hand­sets to delete it within days or be dis­con­nected from the com­pany’s net­work, ac­cord­ing to a staff e-mail viewed by Bloomberg News.</p>
    <p>“Due to a re­cent ex­ec­u­tive or­der ban­ning the use of WeChat, Chevron is re­quir­ing that you re­move the ap­pli­ca­tion from your mo­bile de­vice,” said the memo, which also iden­ti­fies the op­er­at­ing sys­tem and model of each em­ployee’s phone.</p>
    <p>“If no ac­tion is taken prior to Sept 27, your ac­cess to the Chevron sys­tem will be re­moved.”</p>
    <p>A com­pany rep­re­sen­ta­tive de­clined to com­ment and a Ten­cent spokesman did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>WeChat has emerged as a top tar­get in Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s campaign against China ahead of the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber. Ten­sions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing are es­ca­lat­ing as his ad­min­is­tra­tion wages a campaign that has also en­snared China’s ByteDance and its video-shar­ing app TikTok.</p>
    <p>WeChat was sup­posed to dis­ap­pear from US app stores last Sun­day un­der Mr Trump’s ex­ec­u­tive or­der.</p>
    <p>But a San Fran­cisco judge is­sued a pre­lim­i­nary in­junc­tion at the week­end to halt the or­der, say­ing it is against free-speech rights.</p>
    <p>WeChat has 19 mil­lion reg­u­lar users in the US and more than a bil­lion world­wide.</p>
    <p>The app is a gate­way to many of Ten­cent’s most lu­cra­tive busi­nesses, in­clud­ing games and dig­i­tal pay­ments.</p>
    <p>It is also a heav­ily used mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tion tool for Amer­i­can busi­nesses reach­ing out to their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts or con­sumer au­di­ence.</p>
