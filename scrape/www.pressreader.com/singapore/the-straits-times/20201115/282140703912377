    <p>Many ho­tels and ser­viced apart­ments are see­ing strong de­mand for the year-end school hol­i­days, with some ex­pect­ing to be fully booked.</p>
    <p>This is be­fore school for­mally ends next week­end and ahead of the dis­tri­bu­tion of $100 Sin­ga­poRe-dis­cov­ers vouch­ers, which will be is­sued from next month.</p>
    <p>The vouch­ers, which will be given to Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 18 and above, are in­tended to en­cour­age spend­ing on lo­cal at­trac­tions to sup­port the tourism in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>But it seems fam­i­lies need lit­tle en­cour­age­ment. Many are al­ready splash­ing out on big-ticket stay­ca­tions with ex­tras like yacht trips.</p>
    <p>As­cott Or­chard Sin­ga­pore and lyf Fu­nan Sin­ga­pore, which are ser­viced res­i­dences, are ex­pect­ing to op­er­ate “at near 100 per cent oc­cu­pancy” over the year-end school hol­i­days, says Mr Ervin Yeo, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for South-east Asia at The As­cott Lim­ited.</p>
    <p>Ho­tels like Fair­mont Sin­ga­pore and Crowne Plaza Changi Air­port are also see­ing a surge in de­mand from fam­i­lies .</p>
    <p>Many fam­i­lies are also splurg­ing on lux­ury pack­ages and high-end room cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Richards, vice-pres­i­dent of op­er­a­tions (South-east Asia) of Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts, notes a will­ing­ness to fork out for stay­ca­tions with unique fea­tures, amid the pent-up de­mand for travel dur­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>M So­cial and Or­chard Ho­tel, which are man­aged by Mil­len­nium Ho­tels and Re­sorts, of­fer a pop­u­lar Yacht-cation Es­cape pack­age, which starts at $1,380++ at M So­cial and $1,600++ at Or­chard Ho­tel for two per­sons.</p>
    <p>At Amara Sanc­tu­ary Re­sort Sen­tosa, de­mand for its pool vil­las and suites has been greater than for its</p>
    <p>smaller rooms, says Ms Dawn Teo, se­nior vice-pres­i­dent for Amara Ho­tels and Re­sorts. This is in part due to fam­i­lies pre­fer­ring the con­ve­nience of a pri­vate pool.</p>
    <p>Ms Cinn Tan, chief sales and mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer for the Pan Pa­cific Ho­tels Group, which has eight prop­er­ties here, ob­serves that fam­i­lies favour the big­ger space of ser­viced suites, which have a sep­a­rate liv­ing room and kitch­enette.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to this, ho­tels like In­ter­Con­ti­nen­tal Sin­ga­pore are woo­ing fam­i­lies with child-friendly fea­tures such as ad­ven­ture-themed bunk beds with slides, which were launched ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>The growth in fam­ily stay­ca­tion book­ings, com­ing ahead of the highly-an­tic­i­pated Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers voucher dis­burse­ment, shows that Sin­ga­pore­ans might be plan­ning long-term for their staycays, or for sev­eral rounds of it, ho­tel in­dus­try in­sid­ers say.</p>
    <p>Since these vouch­ers are valid till June next year, Sin­ga­pore­ans might be l ook­ing to use these vouch­ers for stay­ca­tions “a lit­tle fur­ther down the road”, says Mr Peter Dramin­sky, re­gional vice-pres­i­dent and gen­eral man­ager at Four Sea­sons Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He says he is see­ing fur­ther seg­re­ga­tion within the mar­ket for fam­i­lies, such as “a grow­ing trend of mother-daugh­ter stay­ca­tions”. His ho­tel, which also of­fers pet stay­ca­tions for guests and their furkids, is among a grow­ing num­ber of ho­tels here which of­fer stay­ca­tions with var­ie­gated ap­peal.</p>
    <p>It is not only fam­i­lies who are driv­ing the year-end de­mand for stay­ca­tions. Bou­tique ho­tel Amoy, which is man­aged by Far East Hos­pi­tal­ity and tar­gets mil­len­ni­als, is fully booked for next month.</p>
    <p>Mr Guil­laume Places, ho­tel man­ager at Ho­tel G Sin­ga­pore, says that De­cem­ber is likely to be the strong­est-per­form­ing month for his ho­tel, whose tar­get au­di­ence in­cludes “mil­len­ni­als look­ing for In­sta­grammable ex­pe­ri­ences”.</p>
    <p>Its pack­ages in­clude #BURGERSINB­ED, with two burg­ers to be en­joyed in the ho­tel room.</p>
