    <p>Sin­ga­pore cel­e­brates its 55th birthday today amid a cli­mate of eco­nomic un­cer­tainty, caused by a global pan­demic that has claimed more than 700,000 lives.</p>
    <p>By any mea­sure, today’s cel­e­bra­tion will be a solemn one, as the coun­try faces its worst re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence and the prospect of more job losses in the months ahead – the on­go­ing fall­out from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But even as ne­ces­sity dic­tates that it must be a safe-dis­tanced Na­tional Day cel­e­brated in­di­vid­u­ally, rather than the usual sea of red and white as tens of thou­sands gather at the Padang or the Ma­rina Bay Float­ing Plat­form, this year’s Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) is more sim­i­lar to past ones than it is dif­fer­ent, as an oc­ca­sion to deepen com­mon bonds and iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Like a re­newal of vows for an old wed­ded cou­ple, it re­mains a day when Sin­ga­pore­ans reaf­firm their faith: not just in one an­other, but as a co­he­sive whole, through thick and thin, and in both good times and bad.</p>
    <p>Fa­mil­iar Na­tional Day touch­stones such as the uni­formed-con­ti­gent pa­rade, flag fly-past, Red Li­ons and an evening show capped with a spec­tac­u­lar fire­works dis­play are on the cards de­spite the no-touch world Sin­ga­pore­ans find our­selves in, which speaks to the NDP or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee’s re­source­ful­ness, but also the fact that the ca­pac­ity to over­come ad­ver­sity re­mains firmly in the na­tional DNA.</p>
    <p>A RE­TURN TO ROOTS</p>
    <p>Kick­ing off with a morn­ing seg­ment at the Padang, this year’s NDP also harks back to the very mo­ment of mod­ern Sin­ga­pore’s found­ing and its first day­time pa­rade a year later, when the found­ing gen­er­a­tion con­veyed to the world its de­ter­mi­na­tion to move from an in­choate group­ing to an or­gan­ised peo­ple.</p>
    <p>On this morn­ing 55 years ago, the Procla­ma­tion of In­de­pen­dence – that Sin­ga­pore will hence­forth be a sov­er­eign, demo­cratic and in­de­pen­dent na­tion – rang out over the air­waves, to a shocked na­tion and the re­al­i­sa­tion that this is­land was sud­denly on its own.</p>
    <p>The found­ing gen­er­a­tion was de­ter­mined to carry on in the face of slim odds that Sin­ga­pore would sur­vive, and wanted the world to know.</p>
    <p>In 1966, to mark the first an­niver­sary of its in­de­pen­dence, the Repub­lic held its first NDP.</p>
    <p>Held at the Padang, this com­prised a 90-minute march-past of 23,000 men, women and chil­dren, in­clud­ing six con­tin­gents of Sin­ga­pore’s then-vol­un­teer army, the Peo­ple’s De­fence Force.</p>
    <p>The coun­try pulled out all the stops for that in­au­gu­ral pa­rade. There was both a day and night fire­works dis­play, re­ported The Straits Times, and a gi­ant float­ing dragon il­lu­mi­nated by 12,500 bulbs “which glided grace­fully be­tween Telok Ayer Basin and Tan­jong Rhu” drew thou­sands of spec­ta­tors from all over the is­land.</p>
    <p>De­spite the host of prob­lems fac­ing a fledg­ling Sin­ga­pore, that first NDP was de­signed to be an ex­tra­or­di­nary event to bring Sin­ga­pore­ans to­gether and nur­ture that bud­ding na­tional spirit and op­ti­mism in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The unity and col­lec­tive con­fi­dence in the fu­ture that it sparked among Sin­ga­pore­ans was price­less, De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen told Par­lia­ment in June.</p>
    <p>“It showed to the rest of the world that de­spite great dif­fi­cul­ties, ours was a coun­try that would not be beaten down – ours was a peo­ple that will rise and over­come,” he said.</p>
    <p>This is why no mat­ter the chal­lenges, be they fi­nan­cial crises or</p>
