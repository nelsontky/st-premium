    <p>a free­lance fit­ness in­struc­tor, on how the pan­demic has af­fected him and oth­ers in his in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Free­lance group fit­ness in­struc­tor</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 af­fected me fi­nan­cially. I strug­gled with a huge fi­nan­cial loss due to the clo­sure of the stu­dios, and coaches like my­self or per­sonal train­ers who are self-em­ployed were un­able to con­tinue with our daily jobs and as­sign­ments,”said Mr Faiz Aman.</p>
    <p>The fit­ness in­struc­tor has been con­duct­ing vir­tual classes via Zoom ever since the cir­cuit breaker – which ended in June – was im­ple­mented. Through the vir­tual les­sons, he has been able to con­nect to friends out­side Sin­ga­pore and has stu­dents from Hong Kong, Tai­wan and the United States tak­ing part in the on­line ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Mr Faiz is glad dif­fer­ent or­gan­i­sa­tions like Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion are tak­ing steps to re­sume classes again at phys­i­cal stu­dios, with safety mea­sures fol­lowed strictly. They have even in­tro­duced a new ap­proach – stu­dents get to at­tend the classes at the phys­i­cal stu­dios as well as from home through an on­line plat­form.</p>
    <p>The tough­est part of the pan­demic for him is not be­ing able to be there phys­i­cally with his stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“Al­though con­duct­ing vir­tual les­sons from home can be re­ally con­ve­nient, the vibe that you are get­ting is still dif­fer­ent com­pared with what you get when you take classes with your friends and kaki at the phys­i­cal stu­dios.”</p>
