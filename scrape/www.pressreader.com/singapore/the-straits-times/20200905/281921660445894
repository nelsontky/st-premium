    <p>When Chi­nese elec­tric car­maker XPeng Mo­tors made its de­but on the New York Stock Ex­change (NYSE) on Aug 27, it closed 40 per cent higher on its first day of trad­ing alone.</p>
    <p>Rais­ing US$1.5 bil­lion (S$2.05 bil­lion) in the process, the firm also sold over 100 mil­lion shares, or Amer­i­can de­pos­i­tory re­ceipts, 15 mil­lion more than was ini­tially ex­pected.</p>
    <p>In the face of grow­ing ten­sions be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton, com­pounded by threats from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion to delist or im­pose ad­di­tional scru­tiny on Chi­nese com­pa­nies list­ing in the US,</p>
    <p>XPeng and sev­eral other Chi­nese firms have gone out on a limb in launch­ing ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings in the US.</p>
    <p>The rea­son, an­a­lysts say, is twofold: prox­im­ity and promi­nence.</p>
    <p>XPeng chose the NYSE be­cause it of­fers the most “so­phis­ti­cated and deep­est” cap­i­tal mar­kets in the world, which is im­por­tant for new and grow­ing in­dus­tries, said com­pany pres­i­dent Brian Gu dur­ing the ini­tial of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>In the past year, no fewer than three elec­tric car­mak­ers have listed on US bourses: XPeng, LI Auto and Nio.</p>
    <p>Bankers would want com­pa­nies to be closer to in­vest­ment cap­i­tal of­fer­ing more liq­uid­ity, said Mr Tu Le of Sino Auto In­sights, a busi­ness in­tel­li­gence and ad­vi­sory firm.</p>
    <p>“Their pres­ence in the US would also sig­nal to the mar­ket that they have global am­bi­tions and are se­ri­ous about tak­ing on Tesla,” he said.</p>
    <p>But be­ing on the US bourses can also be a dou­ble-edged sword: it opens up Chi­nese firms to scru­tiny from the Amer­i­can au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>On June 4, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump or­dered a White House task force to re­view the risks posed to Amer­i­can in­vestors by Chi­nese stocks.</p>
    <p>This fol­lowed a se­ries of ac­count­ing scan­dals at Chi­nese firms listed in the US, the most prom­i­nent of which in­volved Star­bucks chal­lenger Luckin Cof­fee. The take­away cof­fee chain, which listed on the Nas­daq Stock Mar­ket in May last year, lost most of its mar­ket value ear­lier this year af­ter dis­clos­ing it fab­ri­cated nearly US$300</p>
    <p>mil­lion in recorded sales.</p>
    <p>Early last month, the US gov­ern­ment had also threat­ened to delist Chi­nese com­pa­nies that did not meet ac­count­ing stan­dards.</p>
    <p>As re­la­tions be­tween the US and China come un­der sig­nif­i­cant strain, a grow­ing slate of US-listed Chi­nese com­pa­nies have aimed for a trad­ing foothold in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Yum China, which op­er­ates KFC and Pizza Hut in the world’s most pop­u­lous coun­try, yes­ter­day said it raised HK$17.3 bil­lion (S$3 bil­lion) in its Hong Kong list­ing.</p>
    <p>Other US-listed Chi­nese firms to have done se­cond list­ings in Hong Kong in­clude on­line re­tailer JD.com</p>
    <p>and In­ter­net firm NetEase, which col­lec­tively raised US$7.6 bil­lion in June.</p>
    <p>Still, the al­lure of the world’s deep­est stock ex­change seems hard to re­sist, and worth the risk of a fu­ture delist­ing.</p>
    <p>At the same time, many US in­vestors are still drawn to com­pa­nies with strong growth po­ten­tial – Chi­nese or not.</p>
    <p>XPeng’s IPO was pre­ceded by KE Hold­ings, a prop­erty man­age­ment com­pany backed by tech gi­ant Ten­cent and Ja­pan’s SoftBank Group, and LI Auto, which had been backed by units of Gold­man Sachs, Mor­gan Stan­ley and UBS.</p>
    <p>Some 354 com­pa­nies of Chi­nese ori­gin have listed in the US since 1993, rais­ing a to­tal of US$88.5 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to Cit­i­group.</p>
    <p>Since then, 107 have been delisted, but the cur­rent mar­ket value of those re­main­ing stands at US$1.5 tril­lion.</p>
    <p>That Chi­nese tech firms and those with high growth po­ten­tial are still choos­ing to fundraise in the US is a clear sign of mar­ket forces at work, said Dr Wang Huiyao, pres­i­dent of the Cen­tre for China and Glob­al­i­sa­tion, a Chi­nese non-gov­ern­ment think-tank. Tra­di­tion­ally, Chi­nese stocks have been seen as a source of high growth and high in</p>
    <p>vest­ment re­turns. “Even if the US ad­min­is­tra­tion wants a de­cou­pling from China and has been push­ing... the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment and busi­nesses have never said the same. They want to be (in the US),” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>For non state-owned com­pa­nies, a US IPO, which has some of the most strin­gent stan­dards glob­ally and could take years of prepa­ra­tion, would also show their firm can stand up to scru­tiny, and of­fers in­ter­na­tional promi­nence.</p>
    <p>“All of these have been busi­ness de­ci­sions, not pol­i­tics,” he said.</p>
