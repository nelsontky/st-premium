    <p>The Euro­pean Union’s chief Brexit ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier warned yes­ter­day that he can­not guar­an­tee he will strike a trade deal with Bri­tain, and the next few days will be cru­cial.</p>
    <p>“We are quickly ap­proach­ing a make-or-break mo­ment i n the Brexit talks,” Mr Barnier told a video meet­ing of Euro­pean en­voys, a diplo­mat said.</p>
    <p>“In­ten­sive ne­go­ti­a­tions are con­tin­u­ing in Lon­don but, as of this morn­ing, it is still un­clear whether ne­go­tia­tors can bridge the gaps on is­sues like level play­ing field, gov­er­nance and fish­eries,” he said at the meet­ing for the 27 mem­ber states’ en­voys in Brus­sels.</p>
    <p>EU mem­ber states had urged him not to be rushed into agree­ing to an un­sat­is­fac­tory trade deal with Bri­tain just be­cause t he Dec 31 dead­line is loom­ing. A se­nior EU diplo­mat said that sev­eral mem­ber states would rather see ne­go­ti­a­tions, which have been stuck for months, con­tinue past the end of Bri­tain’s tran­si­tion phase on Dec 31 even if that means there is a brief “no deal” pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“There is a worry that, be­cause of this pres­sure of time, there is a temp­ta­tion to rush,” the diplo­mat said af­ter the meet­ing. “We told him, ‘Don’t do that’.”</p>
    <p>The EU and Bri­tain are ne­go­ti­at­ing a trade deal that would reg­u­late their busi­ness re­la­tion­ship from next year, af­ter the end of Bri­tain’s tran­si­tion pe­riod fol­low­ing its exit from the EU. But ne­go­tia­tors can­not over­come dif­fer­ences on three long­stand­ing is­sues: the ac­cess to Bri­tish fish­ing wa­ters, a level play­ing field for busi­ness, and how the over­all agree­ment is en­forced.</p>
    <p>The next few days are cru­cial, with the two sides hop­ing that an agree­ment can be reached to­mor­row or over the week­end, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the EU po­si­tion said ne­go­tia­tors are try­ing to avoid talks run­ning into next week to pre­vent them from hav­ing an im­pact on prepa­ra­tions for a sum­mit of EU lead­ers that starts next Thurs­day. Not only are Euro­pean gov­ern­ments oc­cu­pied with a row over the EU bud­get, the bloc’s ne­go­ti­at­ing team is also con­cerned that pre­sent­ing lead­ers with any­thing other than a signed-and-sealed deal would leave an agree­ment vul­ner­a­ble to be­ing un­picked at the last mo­ment.</p>
    <p>The EU has out­sourced its ne­go­ti­a­tions to Mr Barnier and the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, and some coun­tries – es­pe­cially France and the Nether­lands – are un­easy about what sort of com­pro­mises are be­ing made in their name, said an EU of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>If the two sides fail to reach an ac­cord by Dec 31, busi­nesses and con­sumers will be left fac­ing the cost and dis­rup­tion of tar­iffs and quo­tas, while re­la­tions be­tween Bri­tain and the EU risk be­ing poi­soned for a gen­er­a­tion.</p>
