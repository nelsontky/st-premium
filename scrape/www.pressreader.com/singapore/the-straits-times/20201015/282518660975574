    <p>South Korean ac­tor Jang Hyuk, known for his roles in the ro­mance se­ries You Are My Des­tiny (2014) and pe­riod drama Chuno (2010) had to call on a new set of re­flexes to play the ti­tle role in his new film, The Swords­man.</p>
    <p>His char­ac­ter Tae-yul, a mys­te­ri­ous mar­tial artist, is los­ing his vi­sion. “How do you train for that?” says the 43-year-old ac­tor, who spoke to the press from Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia at a vir­tual con­fer­ence on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The pe­riod drama is about a lone fighter whose daugh­ter is kid­napped, draw­ing him into bat­tle with some of the best pugilists from China. It opens to­day in cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>“Of course the swords­man­ship is im­por­tant, but what’s more im­por­tant is giv­ing hints about the lengths he would go to to save his daugh­ter,” says Jang from his home in Seoul.</p>
    <p>First, he trained him­self to fight with­out see­ing, by teach­ing his body not to re­flex­ively look at what he was strik­ing or block­ing.</p>
    <p>He even­tu­ally set­tled on a way to con­vey rage and a thirst for re­venge, keep­ing in mind that his char­ac­ter could not see who was look­ing at him.</p>
    <p>“I sim­pli­fied my fa­cial ex­pres­sions and tried to be sub­tle in de­liv­er­ing them,” says Jang, speak­ing through an English in­ter­preter.</p>
    <p>He still does much of his own fight scenes rather than use a stunt per­son.</p>
    <p>“The stunts and ac­tion are part of what an ac­tor should be able to per­form – they are part of his role. Daily phys­i­cal train­ing is a part of (what I do),” he says.</p>
    <p>Jang says he is happy to be back at work in South Korea, where film lo­ca­tions are reg­u­lated by pan­demic guide­lines such as tem­per­a­ture checks, dis­in­fec­tion and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Korean news re­ports, film­ing for The Swords­man was com­pleted in 2017, but fi­nan­cial woes de­layed post-pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>The movie was fi­nally re­leased last month in South Korea with­out the usual me­dia fan­fare that sur­rounds pre­mieres.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, I wasn’t able to meet peo­ple and talk about the movie be­cause we had to fol­low gov­ern­ment guide­lines,” he says, adding that he wishes the film in­dus­try, in­clud­ing cin­e­mas, would go back to the “golden days” be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian ac­tor Joe Taslim, who plays vil­lain Ku­ru­tai in The Swords­man, says he hopes fans in his home coun­try will see the movie later this month, af­ter the planned reopening of cin­e­mas there.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old ac­tor, who spoke at the vir­tual con­fer­ence from Jakarta, was a mem­ber of the na­tional judo team. He broke through the film in­dus­try with In­done­sian ac­tion movie The Raid (2011) be­fore ap­pear­ing in Hol­ly­wood pro­duc­tions such as Fast & Fu­ri­ous 6 (2013). He can now be seen in the HBO mar­tial arts se­ries War­rior (2019 to present), which is in its sec­ond sea­son.</p>
    <p>Known for his abil­i­ties with his fists and kicks, Taslim had to pick up the new skill of sword fight­ing from fight co­or­di­na­tors for The Swords­man. But that was not the hard­est part of the pro­duc­tion, says Taslim in English.</p>
    <p>His char­ac­ter is a rel­a­tive of the Qing em­peror, who is Manchurian. As a slave trader, Ku­ru­tai – who bul­lies his way through Joseon-era Korea, then subor­di­nate to Chi­nese rule – speaks Korean with locals and the Manchu lan­guage with his band of fight­ers.</p>
    <p>“The hard­est chal­lenge of my life as an ac­tor was play­ing a char­ac­ter who speaks two lan­guages I don’t speak,” Taslim says.</p>
    <p>He spent three months in South Korea for the pro­duc­tion, dur­ing which he was trained in the two lan­guages daily.</p>
    <p>He hopes the global pop­u­lar­ity of Korean films, tele­vi­sion shows and mu­sic will lead to more multi­na­tional movies like The Swords­man. For now, non-Kore­ans ap­pear­ing in Korean pro­duc­tions re­mains a “rare” phe­nom­e­non.</p>
    <p>“But it’s a good start. I hope it opens op­por­tu­ni­ties for more In­done­sians, Thais, Viet­namese – peo­ple from South-east Asian cin­ema,” he says.</p>
