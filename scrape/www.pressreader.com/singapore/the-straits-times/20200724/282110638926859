    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Am­a­teur traders and a spec­tac­u­lar rally in rub­ber-glove stocks are driv­ing record vol­umes on Malaysia’s stock ex­change, help­ing the bourse op­er­a­tor out­per­form its ma­jor global peers this year.</p>
    <p>Bursa Malaysia has jumped 59 per cent this year, eclips­ing the 43 per cent gain by Hong Kong Ex­changes and Clear­ing – the world’s big­gest ex­change by mar­ket value – even as the lat­ter surged 10 per cent on Tues­day, af­ter bil­lion­aire Jack Ma’s Ant Group an­nounced plans to seek a dual list­ing in Hong Kong and Shanghai.</p>
    <p>Shares of the Malaysian ex­change rose 0.9 per cent to close at RM9.80.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to the trend in many other coun­tries, in­di­vid­ual in­vestors have piled into the South­east Asian stock mar­ket to scoop up bat­tered shares in the wake of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, spurred by gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus and record-low in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>An un­prece­dented rally in glove­maker shares also fu­elled the fevered buy­ing, send­ing over­all trad­ing vol­umes to a record 12.5 bil­lion shares on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“Re­tail par­tic­i­pa­tion con­tin­ues to chalk up new highs, and their net buy­ing mo­men­tum hasn’t di­min­ished,” said Mr Jeremy Goh, an an­a­lyst at Hong Leong In­vest­ment Bank, in a re­cent note.</p>
    <p>The ex­change will de­liver a record profit of RM80 mil­lion (S$26 mil­lion) in the sec­ond quar­ter, Mr Goh said, adding that av­er­age daily trad­ing value has jumped 86 per cent in that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>A big part of the trad­ing frenzy in Malaysia has been helped by the me­te­oric rally in the shares of glove mak­ers.</p>
    <p>More than $1 of every $10 in­vested in the na­tion’s stock mar­ket now is a bet on gloves, due to the su­per­nor­mal de­mand for hy­giene prod­ucts dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>That has, in a way, shielded the ex­change’s shares from the volatil­ity seen in eq­uity mar­kets glob­ally and at home this year.</p>
    <p>While liq­uid­ity can evap­o­rate as fast as it came, Mr Goh said there are en­cour­ag­ing signs it may be sus­tained for the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>He has raised his earn­ings es­ti­mates for Bursa Malaysia for this year by 10 per cent ahead of the com­pany’s re­sults due late this month, and ex­pects the bourse to re­port a record quar­terly profit.</p>
