    <p>BEIRUT • Le­banon mourned the vic­tims of the most pow­er­ful blast to hit the coun­try that was al­ready be­ing crushed by an eco­nomic cri­sis, as res­cuers con­tin­ued search­ing yes­ter­day for those miss­ing since the ex­plo­sion that flat­tened Beirut port and dev­as­tated the city.</p>
    <p>Anger is grow­ing in the city over the gov­ern­ment’s slow re­sponse to the dis­as­ter, amid ac­cu­sa­tions of its fail­ure to pre­vent the ex­plo­sion even though the threat from a huge stock­pile of chem­i­cals at the port was re­port­edly known for years.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron, mak­ing the first visit by a for­eign leader since Tues­day’s blast which killed at least 145 peo­ple and in­jured 5,000, ar­rived in Beirut yes­ter­day along with spe­cial­ist res­cue per­son­nel and equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron told an­gry crowds in cen­tral Beirut that he wanted to lead a global re­sponse and would seek a new deal with the po­lit­i­cal au­thor­i­ties. He toured the city’s shat­tered streets with crowds de­mand­ing the end to a “regime” of politi­cians they blame for cor­rup­tion and drag­ging Le­banon, a for­mer French colony, into dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>“I see the emo­tion on your face, the sad­ness, the pain. This is why I’m here,” he told one group, shak­ing their hands on roads strewn with rub­ble and flanked by shops with win­dows blown out.</p>
    <p>Mr Macron, wear­ing a black tie in mourn­ing and flanked by se­cu­rity guards, promised to send more med­i­cal and other aid to Le­banon, while those around him chanted “Rev­o­lu­tion” and “The peo­ple want the fall of the regime”.</p>
    <p>“But what is also needed here is po­lit­i­cal change. This ex­plo­sion should be the start of a new era,” Mr Macron added.</p>
    <p>Other na­tions have also sent in search and res­cue teams and med­i­cal aid and equip­ment. Dozens of peo­ple re­main miss­ing and up to a quar­ter of a mil­lion peo­ple are left home­less af­ter shock­waves from the blast smashed build­ing fa­cades, sucked fur­ni­ture out into streets and shat­tered win­dows far in­land.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials ex­pect the death toll to rise.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Hassan Diab yes­ter­day de­clared three days of mourn­ing for vic­tims of the ex­plo­sion, the most dev­as­tat­ing ever to hit the city that is still scarred by a civil war from three decades ago and reel­ing from a surge in coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Econ­omy Min­is­ter Raoul Nehme said Le­banon, with its bank­ing sys­tem in cri­sis, a col­laps­ing cur­rency and one of the world’s big­gest debt bur­dens, had “very limited” re­sources to deal with the dis­as­ter, which by some es­ti­mates could cost US$15 bil­lion (S$20.6 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Michel Aoun blamed the blast on 2,750 tonnes of am­mo­nium ni­trate, used in fer­tilis­ers and bombs, that had been stored for six years at the port af­ter it was seized. He promised to in­ves­ti­gate and hold those re­spon­si­ble to ac­count. The gov­ern­ment has also or­dered port of­fi­cials to be put un­der house ar­rest, min­is­te­rial sources told Reuters.</p>
    <p>But or­di­nary Le­banese, who have lost jobs and watched their sav­ings evap­o­rate in the fi­nan­cial cri­sis, blamed politi­cians in charge dur­ing decades of state cor­rup­tion and bad gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>“Our lead­ers are crooks and liars. I don’t be­lieve any in­ves­ti­ga­tion they will do. They de­stroyed the coun­try and they’re still ly­ing to the peo­ple. Who are they kid­ding?” said re­tired port worker Jean Abi Hanna, 80, whose home was dam­aged and daugh­ter and grand­daugh­ter in­jured in the blast.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial source fa­mil­iar with pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions blamed the in­ci­dent on “in­ac­tion and neg­li­gence”, say­ing “noth­ing was done” to re­move haz­ardous ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has given an in­ves­tiga­tive com­mit­tee four days to de­ter­mine re­spon­si­bil­ity for the dis­as­ter, For­eign Min­is­ter Char­bel We­hbe told French ra­dio yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who felt the ex­plo­sive force said they had wit­nessed noth­ing com­pa­ra­ble in years of con­flict and up­heaval in Beirut, which was dev­as­tated by the 1975-1990 civil war and since then has ex­pe­ri­enced big bomb at­tacks, un­rest and a war with Is­rael. “First we heard one sound. Sec­onds later there was a big ex­plo­sion. All hell broke loose,” said Mr Ibrahim Zoobi, who works near the port. “I saw peo­ple thrown five or six me­tres.”</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials re­ported that hospi­tals were run­ning out of beds and equip­ment to at­tend to the in­jured.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tions have been paral­ysed at Beirut port, Le­banon’s main route for im­ports needed to feed a na­tion of more than six mil­lion peo­ple, forc­ing ships to be di­verted to smaller ports.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries have dis­patched emer­gency med­i­cal aid, field hospi­tals, res­cue ex­perts and track­ing dogs.</p>
    <p>Gulf states were among the first to re­spond, with Qatar send­ing mo­bile hospi­tals to ease pres­sure on Le­banon’s al­ready strained med­i­cal sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Kuwait also sent med­i­cal sup­plies, while a Greek C-130 army trans­port plane bear­ing a dozen res­cuers had also landed.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in the Nether­lands, Czech Repub­lic and Poland of­fered an ar­ray of as­sis­tance in­clud­ing doc­tors, po­lice and fire­fight­ers, to­gether with res­cue ex­perts and snif­fer dogs.</p>
    <p>Neigh­bour­ing Is­rael of­fered hu­man­i­tar­ian aid – to a coun­try with which it is still tech­ni­cally at war – via in­ter­na­tional in­ter­me­di­aries.</p>
    <p>The World Bank said on Wed­nes­day that it would work with Le­banon’s part­ners to mo­bilise pub­lic and pri­vate fi­nanc­ing for re­con­struc­tion and re­cov­ery.</p>
