    <p>BIRTH­DAY QUEEN: Ever since Chi­nese su­per­model Qin Shu­pei mar­ried Hong Kong singer-ac­tor Edi­son Chen in 2017, she has been post­ing lovey-dovey pho­tos of them on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The two have also posted nu­mer­ous pho­tos of their three-year-old daugh­ter Alaia as they chron­i­cled her grow­ing up.</p>
    <p>Qin turned 30 on Mon­day and Chen, 39, took the op­por­tu­nity to ex­press his love for her.</p>
    <p>He first posted a photo of</p>
    <p>Qin and their daugh­ter with a birth­day cake and wrote in cap­i­tal let­ters: “Happy birth­day to my queen. Words can’t de­scribe (sic), but you al­ready know how much I love ya.”</p>
    <p>He in­cluded two kiss emo­jis. He then posted a photo of Qin in a swim­ming pool and wrote:</p>
    <p>“It’s my birth­day ev­ery day when this birth­day girl is around. Queen Shu­pei. Beach is bet­ter/Sum­mer 2020.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, she put up a photo of Chen and Alaia nap­ping on an in­flat­able float in the swim­ming pool, with the cap­tion: “My best two presents.”</p>
    <p>Qin was once named by Xin­huanet – a web­site of Xin­hua news agency – as one of China’s top four su­per­mod­els, to­gether with Ming Xi, Liu Wen and Sun Feifei. Chen has not been ac­tive in the entertainm­ent in­dus­try since his daugh­ter was born.</p>
    <p>He had acted in movies such as the In­fer­nal Affairs tril­ogy (2002 to 2003) and Ini­tial D (2005), and was em­broiled in a nude photo scan­dal in 2008.</p>
