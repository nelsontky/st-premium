    <p>Vot­ers in Georgia headed to the polls yes­ter­day in the state’s two run-off races which will de­ter­mine con­trol of the US Se­nate and, with that, Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s abil­ity to carry out his agenda.</p>
    <p>Polls will start clos­ing at 7pm lo­cal time (8am to­day in Sin­ga­pore). Re­sults will be­gin com­ing in soon af­ter that, but it may be days be­fore the win­ners are known, if the race is tight.</p>
    <p>Elec­tion eve cam­paign­ing was at times over­shad­owed by out­go­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s on­go­ing at­tempt to over­turn the re­sult of Novem­ber’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, which he lost.</p>
    <p>“That was a rigged elec­tion,” he said on Mon­day night, at the start of his rally speech in Georgia, meant to drum up sup­port for Repub­li­can in­cum­bents David Per­due and Kelly Lo­ef­fler, who are fac­ing off against their Demo­crat chal­lengers Jon Os­soff and Raphael Warnock.</p>
    <p>“If the lib­eral Democrats take the Se­nate and the White House – they’re not go­ing to take this White House, I’m go­ing to fight like hell,” said Mr Trump, who again raised con­spir­acy the­o­ries, re­peat­ing dis­proven claims of elec­toral fraud.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic Party must win both races to gain con­trol of the Se­nate. But also loom­ing is to­day’s for­mal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of states’ elec­toral votes in Congress to con­firm Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den trav­elled to Georgia on Mon­day af­ter­noon to rally in sup­port of Mr Warnock and Mr Os­soff, ar­gu­ing that their elec­tion would break the grid­lock in Washington and en­able the Democrats to make progress on jobs, health­care, jus­tice and the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Most im­me­di­ately, hav­ing their votes in the Se­nate could en­able Democrats to roll out the US$2,000 (S$2,640) Covid-19 stim­u­lus cheques, Mr Bi­den said. Repub­li­cans op­pose the cheques, although Mr Trump does not.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den also crit­i­cised Mr Per­due and Ms Lo­ef­fler for at­tempt­ing to sub­vert the Con­sti­tu­tion and US democ­racy in back­ing Mr Trump’s at­tempts to re­verse his loss. “You have two se­na­tors who think they’ve sworn an oath of of­fice to Don­ald Trump, not the United States Con­sti­tu­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Politi­cians can­not as­sert, take or seize power,” he said, adding: Power has to be given, granted – by the Amer­i­can peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is treat­ing to­day’s ses­sion of Congress as his fi­nal op­tion to over­turn the elec­tion re­sults and de­mand­ing that Repub­li­can al­lies aid in the ef­fort. A group of Repub­li­cans, in­clud­ing Sen­a­tor Ted Cruz, have said they will con­test the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion, but they do not have the num­bers to suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>Other Repub­li­cans, in­clud­ing Se­nate ma­jor­ity leader Mitch McCon­nell, have ob­jected, largely on the grounds that for Congress to over­turn elec­toral votes cer­ti­fied by the states would be un­demo­cratic and un­con­sti­tu­tional.</p>
    <p>At Mon­day’s rally, Mr Trump ex­pressed his dis­plea­sure with Repub­li­cans – la­belled the “Sur­ren­der Cau­cus” by him on Twit­ter – who were not on board with him.</p>
    <p>“I’ll be back here in a year and a half cam­paign­ing against your gov­er­nor... and your crazy sec­re­tary of state,” he said of Georgia Gov­er­nor Brian Kemp and sec­re­tary of state Brad Raf­fensperger.</p>
    <p>Both are life­long Repub­li­cans once cham­pi­oned by Mr Trump, but who have re­futed his claims of voter fraud and his pres­sures to deny the elec­tion re­sult, most re­cently Mr Raf­fensperger, who did so in a phone call with Mr Trump last Satur­day that was leaked.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also lamented that Supreme Court Jus­tices ap­pointed by him were “not step­ping up to the plate” in not ac­cept­ing his le­gal chal­lenges. He also said he wanted Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, who will pre­side over to­day’s Congress ses­sion, to help in over­turn­ing the re­sults of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,” said Mr Trump at the Georgia rally. “If he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him quite as much.”</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans fear Mr Trump’s mixed mes­sag­ing and in­sis­tence over fraud could dis­cour­age the party’s vot­ers from turn­ing out.</p>
    <p>“This is all eas­ily, prov­ably false, yet the Pres­i­dent per­sists, and by do­ing so, un­der­mines Ge­or­gians’ faith in the elec­tion sys­tem,” said state elec­tion of­fi­cial Gabriel Ster­ling on Mon­day, in a press con­fer­ence where he sys­tem­at­i­cally de­bunked Mr Trump’s fraud claims.</p>
    <p>“Given the na­ture of the Pres­i­dent’s state­ments... we are specif­i­cally ask­ing and telling you to turn out and vote to­mor­row,” said Mr Ster­ling, a life­long Repub­li­can. “Do not self-sup­press your own vote.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the po­lit­i­cal tur­moil has the US on edge. In a let­ter re­leased on Mon­day, more than 170 lead­ers of prom­i­nent busi­nesses, in­clud­ing Pfizer and Mi­crosoft, urged Congress to ac­cept the elec­toral col­lege re­sults.</p>
    <p>Pro-Trump sup­port­ers are gath­er­ing in Washington ahead of to­day’s Congress ses­sion, with the cap­i­tal city’s mayor urg­ing res­i­dents to stay home and ac­ti­vat­ing the Na­tional Guard over fears of protests turn­ing vi­o­lent.</p>
    <p>Leader of the far-right Proud Boys group En­rique Tar­rio was ar­rested on Mon­day, shortly af­ter he ar­rived in the cap­i­tal, on charges of prop­erty de­struc­tion from a protest a month ago.</p>
