    <p>For­mer po­lice­man Iskan­dar Rah­mat, who is on death row for the high-pro­file Ko­van dou­ble mur­der of 2013, will have a chance to ar­gue be­fore the Court of Ap­peal that his de­fence team should be in­ves­ti­gated for mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>A five-judge panel, rul­ing against the Law So­ci­ety yes­ter­day, said com­plainants who are pur­su­ing dis­ci­plinary probes against lawyers have the right to ap­peal all the way to Sin­ga­pore’s high­est court.</p>
    <p>The court’s de­ci­sion over­ruled the le­gal po­si­tion that was set in a 2011 case, which the Law So­ci­ety had re­lied on – known as Top Ten En­ter­tain­ment – in ar­gu­ing that Iskan­dar had no right of ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon said in a writ­ten de­ci­sion: “In our judg­ment, on this point, Top Ten En­ter­tain­ment was wrongly de­cided and there is in fact a right of ap­peal to this court against a de­ci­sion made pur­suant to Sec­tion 96 of the Le­gal Pro­fes­sion Act.”</p>
    <p>Iskan­dar was found guilty on two charges of mur­der and sen­tenced to death in 2015.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his trial, he was rep­re­sented by a team of six lawyers who were ap­pointed to de­fend him un­der the Le­gal As­sis­tance Scheme for Cap­i­tal Of­fences.</p>
    <p>Iskan­dar was rep­re­sented by dif­fer­ent coun­sel dur­ing his ap­peal in 2016 against his con­vic­tion and sen­tence, which was dis­missed in 2017.</p>
    <p>In 2018, he filed a com­plaint to the Law So­ci­ety, al­leg­ing that the six-lawyer team had failed to comply with his in­struc­tions in con­duct­ing his de­fence.</p>
    <p>A four-mem­ber in­quiry com­mit­tee, af­ter speak­ing to Iskan­dar in pri­son and get­ting ex­pla­na­tions from the lawyers, unan­i­mously de­cided that no for­mal in­ves­ti­ga­tion was nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>In June 2019, Iskan­dar ap­plied to the High Court seek­ing a re­view of the Law So­ci­ety’s de­ci­sion to dis­miss his com­plaint. He asked the court to or­der the Law So­ci­ety to start the process for a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal to be ap­pointed to in­ves­ti­gate his com­plaint.</p>
    <p>High Court judge Valerie Thean dis­missed his ap­pli­ca­tion in Oc­to­ber 2019 and found that for­mal in­ves­ti­ga­tions were not war­ranted.</p>
    <p>Iskan­dar then filed an ap­peal against Jus­tice Thean’s de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>In March last year, the Law So­ci­ety ap­plied to strike out his ap­peal. Its ap­pli­ca­tion was dis­missed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The de­tails of Iskan­dar’s al­le­ga­tions were not be­fore the court as it was de­cid­ing on the le­gal is­sue of ju­ris­dic­tion. The mer­its of his case will be dealt with when the ap­peal proper is heard in due course.</p>
