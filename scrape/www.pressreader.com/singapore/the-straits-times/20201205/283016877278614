    <p>Imag­ine a car about the size of a Range Rover Evoque be­ing pow­ered by a 1.3-litre en­gine.</p>
    <p>That would be the new GLB200, Mercedes-Benz’s first com­pact seven-seater sport util­ity ve­hi­cle. It is, in fact, longer and taller than the Evoque, but not as wide.</p>
    <p>To say that the GLB is un­der­pow­ered would be stat­ing the ob­vi­ous. While the same power plant serves the Mercedes-Benz B200 five-seater some­what ad­e­quately, it now has to con­tend with a big­ger, heav­ier ve­hi­cle (the GLB is about 150kg heav­ier than B200), which is sup­posed to carry two more pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>And the lack of power shows. Ac­cel­er­a­tion is of­ten laboured, with the puny turbo en­gine strain­ing at the slight­est per­sua­sion to go faster.</p>
    <p>Put pedal to metal and you get a sick­en­ing whine as the tachome­ter swings past 4,500rpm. This, how­ever, is not ac­com­pa­nied by any sub­stan­tial pick-up in speed.</p>
    <p>It re­minds you of clutch slip­page in a worn-out trans­mis­sion. If Mercedes-Benz en­gi­neers in­ten­tion­ally de­signed this to dis­cour­age driv­ers from push­ing the GLB hard, they have suc­ceeded.</p>
    <p>Drive the GLB gin­gerly and it will dis­play some sem­blance of re­fine­ment. So, as long as you leave early for ap­point­ments and drive the Merc in an un­hur­ried fash­ion, all should be well.</p>
    <p>Drive­abil­ity aside, the mul­ti­seater fam­ily car­rier has a de­cent ride and is sat­is­fac­to­rily in­su­lated.</p>
    <p>It has a 2,829mm wheel­base, 100mm longer than the B200’s. That would be plenty or­di­nar­ily, but it is not a lot at all af­ter you shoe­horn a third row of seats in.</p>
    <p>The last row is rather un­in­hab­it­able – even for small chil­dren – which is a shame be­cause the car is not wide enough to fit three abreast in the sec­ond row. So, get­ting one per­son to go to the third row is not an op­tion.</p>
    <p>Even if some­how you are able to squeeze seven on board, the car’s sin­gle-zone cli­mate con­trol is not ad­e­quate for all three rows.</p>
    <p>The GLB is clearly aimed at BMW’s highly suc­cess­ful (if dulldriv­ing) 2-se­ries Gran Tourer, a car which is at­trac­tive to buy­ers pri­mar­ily be­cause it bears a BMW em­blem. On that count, the GLB should also do well, as it is adorned with an even more pow­er­ful em­blem.</p>
    <p>Alas, the GLB costs $20,000 more than the 2GT.</p>
    <p>What the Merc has in its favour is styling. Although not ex­actly rev­o­lu­tion­ary or in­spir­ing, it con­veys so­lid­ity and rugged­ness, with a recog­nis­able ho­mo­gene­ity</p>
    <p>that runs across Daim­ler’s line-up of crossovers.</p>
    <p>As stated at the be­gin­ning, it is a size­able car. And with size comes pres­ence.</p>
    <p>The GLB200 is also rea­son­ably well-equipped. Among other things, it has a pow­ered tail­gate – use­ful dur­ing times when you fold down the third row to free up space for some se­ri­ous shop­ping. With the third row up, there is hardly any stowage.</p>
    <p>A widescreen cock­pit, ap­plied in many mod­els now, takes cen­tre stage on a fas­cia, which is a mix of kitsch and techno. The in­fo­tain­ment sys­tem comes with “Hey</p>
    <p>Mercedes” voice com­mand, which I have never found any use for.</p>
    <p>Ef­fi­ciency-wise, the test-car av­er­aged be­tween 10 and 11 litres/100km, which is nowhere near the stated fig­ure and quite unim­pres­sive for a 1.3-litre.</p>
    <p>If you are eye­ing this car, you might do bet­ter with a B200 in­stead. The smaller car may not have a third row of seats, but at least it is more drive­able.</p>
