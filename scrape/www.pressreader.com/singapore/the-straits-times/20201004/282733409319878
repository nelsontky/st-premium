    <p>March 21 - April 19</p>
    <p>Try not to push too hard, but it is a great time to ad­vo­cate for your most im­por­tant val­ues. Things are look­ing good, which means now is the right time to check your heart to see if it is on your side.</p>
    <p>April 20 - May 20</p>
    <p>Share your feel­ings with that per­son – you are com­ing from the right place and the world needs more af­fec­tion, not less. You should be able to get things where they need to be in no time.</p>
    <p>May 21 - June 20</p>
    <p>Your ad­vice is cru­cial, so do not hold back. Some­one close to you is head­ing in the wrong di­rec­tion, but you should be able to steer him or her back to­wards some­thing that will be bet­ter.</p>
    <p>June 21 - July 22</p>
    <p>Your orig­i­nal think­ing is re­fresh­ing – es­pe­cially at work, though it could be equally ter­rific when ap­plied to any other part of your life. Things are look­ing up, so keep that smile on your face.</p>
    <p>July 23 - Aug 22</p>
    <p>It is way too easy for you to get trapped by bu­reau­cracy, but that just means you have to avoid the red tape at all costs. Things should flow more smoothly by this time to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Aug 23 - Sept 22</p>
    <p>Your thought­ful side is in full force and you may hit upon some se­ri­ously cool new ideas or fig­ure out a prob­lem that has been bug­ging you quite a bit lately. Make the most of that big brain.</p>
    <p>Sept 23 - Oct 22</p>
    <p>Now is the time for you to check back in with your col­leagues and al­lies – at least one of them will have an an­swer for you. In fact, you may find your peo­ple are ready for some­thing big.</p>
    <p>Oct 23 - Nov 21</p>
    <p>Your in­ten­sity is in­tim­i­dat­ing some­times – but right now, you are hav­ing the right ef­fect on the right peo­ple. Any­one who edges away is just not right for you, at least not now.</p>
    <p>Nov 22 - Dec 21</p>
    <p>You have to look at things from a broader per­spec­tive – oth­er­wise, it will be too easy for you to for­get about the de­tails that make up ev­ery big plan. If they all add up, then go for it.</p>
    <p>Dec 22 - Jan 19</p>
    <p>Main­tain your usual dis­ci­pline and you should find that things get a lot bet­ter for you. It is one of those days when you can be sure that you are on the right track, so keep mov­ing and all will be well.</p>
    <p>Jan 20 - Feb 18</p>
    <p>Your past is not stay­ing where it be­longs – which is to say that some­one or some­thing you thought was long gone shows up to say hello. It is up to you whether to em­brace or re­ject it.</p>
    <p>Feb 19 - March 20</p>
    <p>Go easy on who­ever is irk­ing you – there is just no need for you to rile him or her up and raise your own blood pres­sure even higher. Live and let live, and see how much bet­ter things can be.</p>
