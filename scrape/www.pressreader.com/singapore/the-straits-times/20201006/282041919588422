    <p>The list of vot­ers who failed to cast their votes in the July gen­eral elec­tion is avail­able for in­spec­tion, but some vot­ers in Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC can do so only af­ter Jan 10 next year.</p>
    <p>The rea­son is that the list of vot­ers in one polling district in the GRC will be pub­lished later be­cause of a mis­take by an elec­tion of­fi­cial, said the Elec­tions De­part­ment (ELD) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion of­fi­cial at the Elias Park Pri­mary School Count­ing Cen­tre “had in­ad­ver­tently placed the copy of the regis­ter of elec­tors for the polling district PN23 of the elec­toral di­vi­sion of Pasir Ris-Pung­gol... to­gether with the counted bal­lot pa­pers and other doc­u­ments into the bal­lot box which was sealed”, the ELD said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The sealed box is now kept in the Supreme Court vault, it added.</p>
    <p>Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC saw a three-cor­nered fight that was won by the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party team led by Senior Min­is­ter Teo Chee Hean.</p>
    <p>The ELD ex­plained that un­der the Par­lia­men­tary Elec­tions Act, all the sealed boxes con­tain­ing counted bal­lot pa­pers and doc­u­ments re­lat­ing to the gen­eral elec­tion must be kept in safe cus­tody un­til they are de­stroyed six months af­ter the date of the polls.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the six-month pe­riod, only a judge of the High Court can or­der the sealed boxes to be opened and their con­tents in­spected, and even then, it can only be for the pur­pose of in­sti­tut­ing or main­tain­ing a pros­e­cu­tion or an ap­pli­ca­tion to in­val­i­date an elec­tion,” the ELD said.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob has di­rected the Re­turn­ing Of­fi­cer to re­trieve the copy of the regis­ter of vot­ers of the af­fected polling district on or af­ter Jan 10 next year.</p>
    <p>She has also di­rected that the copy be de­stroyed no later than 30 days af­ter it has been re­trieved.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers on the de­layed list can ap­ply to the ELD as usual to have their names re­stored to the regis­ter of elec­tors.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble vot­ers who failed to cast their votes on July 10 have been re­moved from the regis­ter, un­der the Par­lia­men­tary Elec­tions Act. They are in­el­i­gi­ble to vote or stand as a can­di­date in fu­ture elec­tions if their names are not re­stored.</p>
    <p>Those with le­git­i­mate rea­sons for not vot­ing do not have to pay a penalty to have their names re­stored. Oth­er­wise, they have to pay $50 to get back on the regis­ter.</p>
    <p>The list of non-vot­ers can be in­spected at the Elec­tions De­part­ment, des­ig­nated com­mu­nity cen­tres or com­mu­nity clubs, or Sin­ga­pore overseas mis­sions that serve as overseas reg­is­tra­tion cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans may also check their elec­tor sta­tus elec­tron­i­cally on the ELD web­site or on the SingPass Mo­bile app.</p>
