    <p>French elec­tronic dance mu­sic (EDM) god­fa­ther David Guetta had much to cel­e­brate over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, he was crowned the world’s No. 1 DJ by dance­mu­sic pub­li­ca­tion DJ Mag – based on votes by 1.3 mil­lion read­ers. It was a po­si­tion he last held in 2011.</p>
    <p>The next day, he picked up the Best Elec­tronic prize at this year’s MTV Europe Mu­sic Awards.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic might have cur­tailed his reg­u­lar global tours, but the 53-year-old has never been busier.</p>
    <p>In the past months, he has re­leased an EP, New Rave, with Dan­ish DJ/pro­ducer Morten, as well as sev­eral sin­gles, in­clud­ing Let’s Love with Aus­tralian singer Sia.</p>
    <p>In April and May, his two United At Home on­line shows broke live-stream records on Face­book, draw­ing 50 mil­lion view­ers and rais­ing more than US$1.5 mil­lion (S$2.02 mil­lion) for Covid-19 re­lief char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He speaks to The Straits Times in a Zoom in­ter­view from Span­ish party is­land Ibiza.</p>
    <p>How do you feel be­ing voted No. 1 DJ again?</p>
    <p>Well, it’s pretty amaz­ing be­cause it hap­pened on my birth­day, I’m su­per happy. Ob­vi­ously, it’s a great hon­our and it’s crazy be­cause I last won nine years ago.</p>
    <p>Also, it’s a bit dif­fer­ent be­cause I think nine years ago, I won be­cause of the cul­tural im­pact of hav­ing my mu­sic cross over to ra­dio. This year, prob­a­bly, is the other way around be­cause I’ve done all th­ese new sounds with the New Rave EP.</p>
    <p>It’s ex­cit­ing to win twice for two com­pletely dif­fer­ent rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Does it sur­prise you that you are still at the top – 36 years af­ter you started dee­jay­ing?</p>
    <p>Longevity, that’s a big thing. I don’t take it for granted, I ap­pre­ci­ate it a lot and work hard for my shows. It’s crazy. I spent so much time work­ing on them.</p>
    <p>So, yeah, I’m also putting in the ef­fort and it makes me happy that peo­ple ap­pre­ci­ate it.</p>
    <p>You broke records with your live-stream DJ sets. Do you think on­line gigs are here to stay?</p>
    <p>If I’m be­ing to­tally hon­est, it’s not the same, but it’s just that there’s noth­ing else right now.</p>
    <p>When I started to do this, all the other artists were do­ing shows from their bed­rooms. I was like, “No, we are en­ter­tain­ers. We need to come with a real show. We can still give some­thing more”.</p>
    <p>It’s crazy be­cause the char­ity shows I did to col­lect money to help peo­ple with Covid and, I mean, not only did we col­lect US$1.5 mil­lion, but we also had 50 mil­lion views. That’s in­sane, on just so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>This is like ma­jor global TV show type of num­bers. But it was also a time when ev­ery­body was con­fined at home and had noth­ing else to do than to be on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>But I can­not imag­ine do­ing this my en­tire life. I need the real thing.</p>
    <p>You have been busy putting out new songs and remixes. What in­spires you?</p>
    <p>I had noth­ing to do and I’ve still man­aged to be com­pletely over­whelmed with work. I’ve never had so much time to make mu­sic since I was maybe 17.</p>
    <p>I just like work­ing and am en­joy­ing it even more this time be­cause mak­ing mu­sic un­der th­ese cir­cum­stances is spe­cial as I don’t have an agenda. I don’t have the stress of hav­ing to do shows.</p>
    <p>I just make mu­sic for fun.</p>
    <p>I can­not wait to be able to per­form them be­cause my main mo­ti­va­tion, when I’m in the stu­dio, is imag­in­ing how the mu­sic will fit when I play live.</p>
    <p>When you are mak­ing mu­sic, do you think about which gen­er­a­tion it is for? Is it for long-time fans who have been with you from day one or those who have only re­cently dis­cov­ered your mu­sic?</p>
    <p>You know what was strange with me, I started to deejay pro­fes­sion­ally in a club when I was 17. And the peo­ple who were in the club were an av­er­age of 22 years old. Then, when I was 32, it was still 22 and so on. It makes me feel like I’m 22 for­ever.</p>
    <p>So, to an­swer your ques­tion, I do have orig­i­nal fans who have been fol­low­ing me from the be­gin­ning.</p>
    <p>But I think more about the teenagers and the ones in their early 20s. Be­cause the way I think of mu­sic is not so much about age.</p>
    <p>It’s more about mak­ing you dance – and usu­ally, young peo­ple are the ones go­ing out to dance.</p>
    <p>I make dance mu­sic, so that’s why my crowd doesn’t get old.</p>
