    <p>Lion City Sailors striker Stipe Plaz­i­bat will face a late fit­ness test to de­cide if he will be ready for to­day’s high-stakes show­down against Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) lead­ers Al­birex Ni­igata.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old Croat is the com­pe­ti­tion’s lead­ing scorer with 14 goals, but hob­bled off with a ham­string strain in the 3-1 win over Hougang United on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Sailors coach Aure­lio Vid­mar re­futed the no­tion that he is keep­ing their op­po­nents guess­ing. The Aus­tralian, 53, said: “We will make the de­ci­sion on Sun­day morn­ing. My in­ter­est is the player’s health. If he is go­ing to do more dam­age, then we won’t take the risk.</p>
    <p>“If this was a cup fi­nal or the fi­nal game of the sea­son, then it’s a com­pletely dif­fer­ent story. There’s no ques­tion we would try to play him be­cause if he breaks down we are go­ing into a break.</p>
    <p>“But this sit­u­a­tion is a bit dif­fer­ent, a bit more del­i­cate.”</p>
    <p>What is un­doubt­edly clear are the stakes at hand. There are just five games left and this clash be­tween first and third in the ta­ble will have a huge bear­ing on the cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>The Sailors are three points be­hind Al­birex, cham­pi­ons from 2016 to 2018, but will leapfrog them with a win. A loss how­ever, will cre­ate a six-point deficit that may be too much to over­come.</p>
    <p>The other ti­tle con­tenders, Tampines Rovers, also have 20 points like Al­birex and travel to face Tan­jong Pa­gar United in to­day’s other match.</p>
    <p>Vid­mar, the for­mer Aus­tralia cap­tain and coach, re­mains con­fi­dent of his side’s abil­ity to hit the back of the net re­gard­less of Plaz­i­bat’s avail­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The Sailors have notched 29 goals, with 10 dif­fer­ent scor­ers. Both are league-lead­ing num­bers.</p>
    <p>They will also wel­come back dy­namic mid­fielder Song Ui-young from a head in­jury, while play­maker Shah­dan Su­laiman, who was sorely missed in the 3-2 de­feat when both sides met last month, has also re­turned. He will be a threat from set pieces.</p>
    <p>Vid­mar said: “Goals are a big part of Stipe’s game, and his link-up play has been very good. But the beauty of our team is ev­ery­one is itch­ing to play and the guys who have come in have stepped up and done an amaz­ing job.</p>
    <p>“That’s the com­mit­ment and com­pe­ti­tion I want in the team.</p>
    <p>“So, we are in good shape. Shahril (Ishak) is back in the team, we have Gabriel Quak, we can put Adam Swandi there, we can put Hafiz Nor up front.</p>
    <p>“We have op­tions, play­ers with dif­fer­ent char­ac­ter­is­tics and play­ing styles, which is a plus.”</p>
    <p>His team are ex­cel­lent front run­ners too. While 26 of the 36 SPL games this term have been won by the side that scores first, the Sailors are mas­ters of this. They have picked up the full three points in all the five matches they have opened the scor­ing.</p>
    <p>But stand­ing in their way is an ob</p>
    <p>du­rate Al­birex de­fence that has kept three con­sec­u­tive clean sheets and a win­ning men­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>Seven of their 22 goals have come af­ter the 75th minute, in­clud­ing the 94th-minute win­ner against the Sailors.</p>
    <p>White Swans coach Keiji Shige­tomi said: “The Sailors have many star play­ers and are not a one-man team that rely only on Stipe.</p>
    <p>“Like­wise, we have been with­out our striker Reo Nishiguchi (five goals), but I’m happy with the</p>
    <p>other play­ers who have stepped up and shared the re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“We are pre­pared for a tough match, but we are con­fi­dent of our abil­i­ties. Our late goals are a tes­ta­ment of our fit­ness and never-say­die spirit.</p>
    <p>“Of course, we would pre­fer to score as many goals as early as pos­si­ble, but the SPL is a very com­pet­i­tive league, and a win in any form is im­por­tant for us.”</p>
