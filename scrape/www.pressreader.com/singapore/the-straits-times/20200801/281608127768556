    <p>Covid-19 has led to a surge in e-com­merce trans­ac­tions, but de­liv­er­ing pur­chases is the stick­ing point. Sin­ga­pore Post is re­view­ing its en­tire postal work­flow for the new re­tail fu­ture, es­pe­cially the cru­cial “last mile” as­pect, says post­mas­ter-gen­eral Vin­cent Phang.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis has brought ma­jor dis­rup­tions to Sin­ga­pore. As this coun­try de­pends heav­ily on global trade and sup­ply chains, the in­abil­ity to move goods freely within and across bor­ders due to lock­downs world­wide has posed sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Here in South-east Asia, postal or­gan­i­sa­tions have been hit by man­power chal­lenges, ser­vice sus­pen­sions and in­ven­tory back­logs, with de­liv­er­ies de­layed by weeks and even months.</p>
    <p>SingPost has been work­ing with its postal coun­ter­parts to iden­tify non-tra­di­tional means of de­liv­er­ing across bor­ders, given the dearth of avi­a­tion con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>But the dy­namic cir­cum­stances caused by a con­stantly evolv­ing sit­u­a­tion in 200 coun­tries on a daily ba­sis have made the al­ready gar­gan­tuan task even more daunt­ing.</p>
    <p>The Univer­sal Postal Union’s lat­est re­port on the pan­demic’s im­pact on global postal op­er­a­tions states: “In­ter­na­tional flows have been dis­rupted... with an in­creas­ing num­ber of postal items ‘stranded’ in the ‘lo­gis­ti­cal no-man’s land’ be­tween sender and re­ceiver.”</p>
    <p>That said, the cri­sis has brought about a sig­nif­i­cant uptick in e-com­merce trans­ac­tions for both es­sen­tial and dis­cre­tionary items.</p>
    <p>Last year, Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal on­line re­tail pen­e­tra­tion con­sti­tuted less than 10 per cent of all re­tail trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>But for the last two months, data from mul­ti­ple stud­ies has con­sis­tently shown an al­most three­fold surge in on­line pen­e­tra­tion to 17 per cent, even as to­tal re­tail sales plunged 40 per cent, in­clud­ing fig­ures from bricks-and-mor­tar stores.</p>
    <p>SingPost ex­pe­ri­enced an un­prece­dented 40 per cent surge year on year in e-com­merce de­liv­er­ies dur­ing the same pe­riod, with our postal ser­vice re­spon­si­ble for de­liv­er­ing al­most half of these vol­umes.</p>
    <p>PUSH­ING THE NORMS</p>
    <p>In the ini­tial weeks, con­sumers fo­cused on pur­chas­ing es­sen­tial goods and gro­ceries.</p>
    <p>As the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in Sin­ga­pore pro­gressed, more dis­cre­tionary pur­chases like fash­ion ap­parel, elec­tronic games and ap­pli­ances were made – a strong in­di­ca­tor of ris­ing con­sumer con­fi­dence in e-com­merce re­tail and grow­ing ac­cep­tance that dig­i­tal shop­ping is a wor­thy re­place­ment for the phys­i­cal shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 out­break has also pushed the norms in other sec­tors.</p>
    <p>SingPost launched its is­land­wide medicine de­liv­ery ser­vice in April, which in­cludes the de­liv­ery of tem­per­a­ture-sen­si­tive sup­plies that re­quire spe­cial han­dling.</p>
    <p>We have also re­cently been ap­pointed by the Gov­ern­ment to de­liver high-se­cu­rity items such as pass­ports and iden­tity cards.</p>
    <p>The ac­cep­tance of de­liv­ery ser­vices by med­i­cal and se­cu­rity agen­cies rep­re­sents a break­through for the lo­gis­tics in­dus­try, and high­lights the la­tent ap­petite for e-com­merce and the fea­si­bil­ity of phys­i­cal de­liv­er­ies for all cat­e­gories of prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>It is clear that the out­break has had the un­ex­pected ef­fect of be­ing a shot in the arm for the growth of the e-com­merce sec­tor.</p>
    <p>It has acted as a cat­a­lyst for con­sumers stuck at home to adopt this more seden­tary form of pur­chas­ing. This trend is likely to stay.</p>
    <p>Pi­o­neer­ing tech­nolo­gies such as smart let­ter boxes that can dis­pense both mail and e-com­merce pack­ages se­curely via key­less authen­ti­ca­tion, and smart stamps that al­low even ba­sic mail to be tracked, as well as an over­haul of the en­tire postal work­flow, are in the works, and the pub­lic will be able to ex­pe­ri­ence some of these world-first tech­nolo­gies in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>OB­STA­CLES TO OVER­COME</p>
    <p>On the op­er­a­tional front, the lo­gis­tics in­dus­try has had to grap­ple with re­duced pro­duc­tiv­ity from the manda­tory im­po­si­tion of health pro­to­cols as well as a labour crunch due to neigh­bour­ing coun­tries’ bor­der clo­sures.</p>
    <p>These have trans­lated into de­liv­ery de­lays across the board – an un­de­sir­able out­come, es­pe­cially dur­ing these times.</p>
    <p>More broadly, the do­mes­tic last-mile de­liv­ery sec­tor re­mains highly frag­mented, be­ing heav­ily re­liant on labour and trans­port.</p>
    <p>All last-mile providers em­ploy the same re­source- and fleet-heavy op­er­a­tional flow: in­di­vid­ual driv­ers in vans who de­liver goods to homes.</p>
    <p>It is es­ti­mated that for ev­ery 10 per cent growth in e-com­merce parcels, there is an 8.3 per cent in­crease in fleet size. This is a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in emis­sions and con­ges­tion if there is no struc­tural so­lu­tion in terms of ag­gre­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>In labour-scarce Sin­ga­pore, be­ing re­liant on this op­er­a­tional model is also in­ef­fi­cient, in­ad­e­quate and clearly not sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>While we ex­pect some re­lief from the ten­ta­tive restora­tion of in­ter­na­tional air flights and the grad­ual re­lax­ation of do­mes­tic safe­guard mea­sures, the lo­gis­tics in­dus­try will need to step up if it wants to make on­line re­tail a wor­thy re­place­ment for the tra­di­tional buy­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Lo­gis­tics will need to be faster, more re­silient, less sub­ject to man­power-re­lated chal­lenges, and of­fer a bet­ter cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence from point of sale to de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Scal­a­bil­ity and agility will be key, as well as the need to lever­age tech­nol­ogy to cater to this shift.</p>
    <p>NA­TIONAL IN­FRA­STRUC­TURE NEEDED</p>
    <p>So it is im­por­tant to in­vest in ur­ban in­fra­struc­ture that will al­low us to ef­fi­ciently op­er­ate this last-mile de­liv­ery net­work.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment’s na­tion­wide par­cel locker net­work is one ex­am­ple of in­fra­struc­ture that will as­sist in mak­ing ur­ban de­liv­er­ies more seam­less.</p>
    <p>By the end of next year, all neigh­bour­hoods will be equipped with open-ac­cess par­cel lock­ers, pro­vid­ing even more in­cen­tive for shop­pers to pur­chase on­line and cre­at­ing a more ef­fi­cient al­ter­na­tive to doorstep de­liv­er­ies for de­liv­ery per­son­nel.</p>
    <p>As post – with its cost-ef­fi­ciency, fa­mil­iar­ity and preva­lence – is the pri­mary mode for the de­liv­ery of e-com­merce items, SingPost has also been de­vel­op­ing new tech­nolo­gies and so­lu­tions to bet­ter serve e-com­merce cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Track­a­bil­ity fea­tures for the postal ser­vice were in­tro­duced last year, pro­vid­ing higher de­liv­ery as­sur­ances for cus­tomers while main­tain­ing the cost-ef­fec­tive­ness of the mail net­work de­liv­ery to let­ter boxes.</p>
    <p>We are re­view­ing our en­tire postal work­flow to pre­pare for an e-com­merce-driven fu­ture. This “Fu­ture of Post” pro­ject aims to re­vamp the decades-old na­tional postal sys­tem to be more adept at e-com­merce pack­age de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>Pi­o­neer­ing tech­nolo­gies such as smart let­ter boxes that can dis­pense both mail and e-com­merce pack­ages se­curely via key­less authen­ti­ca­tion, and smart stamps that al­low even ba­sic mail to be tracked, as well as an over­haul of the en­tire postal work­flow, are in the works, and the pub­lic will be able to ex­pe­ri­ence some of these world-first tech­nolo­gies in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has given a glimpse of what the fu­ture of e-com­merce can be, but it has also shone a harsh spot­light on the in­dus­try’s need to re-en­gi­neer the lo­gis­tics net­work and in­vest in e-com­merce-friendly in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>We must cre­ate a de­pend­able, cost-ef­fec­tive and re­li­able de­liv­ery sys­tem that can deal with high-ve­loc­ity, high-as­sur­ance and high-vol­ume de­liv­er­ies na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat has called for all in­dus­tries to relook tra­di­tional pro­cesses to meet the chal­lenges of the post-Covid-19 world, and the lo­gis­tics in­dus­try should heed this call.</p>
    <p>Should it suc­ceed, it can so­lid­ify Sin­ga­pore’s rep­u­ta­tion as a trusted and re­silient sup­ply chain node for global e-com­merce flows.</p>
