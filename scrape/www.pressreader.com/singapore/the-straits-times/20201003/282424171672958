    <p>• Jockey Frankie Det­tori’s “favourite girl” En­able has her fi­nal tilt at mak­ing racing his­tory to­mor­row, as she strives to be­come the first horse to win the Prix de l’Arc de Tri­om­phe three times.</p>
    <p>The su­per­mare, who won in 2017 and 2018, is favourite in the Group 1 race over 2,400m at Longchamp in Paris, France.</p>
    <p>The Arc is re­garded as Europe’s most pres­ti­gious race.</p>
    <p>At six years old, trainer John Gos­den’s “bat­tle-hard­ened” mare has kept racing fans’ hearts beat­ing in the strangest of sea­sons, in­ter­rupted by the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>En­able has en­deared her­self to race­go­ers through her ex­ploits on the track and also her longevity. At her age, most top-class horses have re­tired to pro­duce blue-blooded progeny.</p>
    <p>At 49, Ital­ian star Det­tori could eas­ily have opted for a com­fort­able re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>But, as he had said ear­lier this year, En­able has “taken me to places emo­tion­ally I have never been be­fore”.</p>
    <p>This bond was strength­ened when Det­tori and En­able romped to a his­toric third vic­tory in the King Ge­orge VI and Queen El­iz­a­beth Stakes at As­cot in July.</p>
    <p>“What a horse, what can you say? It’s no bur­den to say I love her so much. My favourite girl,” Det­tori purred.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple get at­tached to her, no more than me and Imran (the groom), who looks af­ter her. She has got this amaz­ing pres­ence and these mas­sive, big ears.</p>
    <p>“She walks with her chest stick­ing out and you can see it. She gives those vibes to ev­ery­one and peo­ple are at­tached to her for that rea­son.</p>
    <p>“I get the priv­i­lege to ride her and the pub­lic are ac­tu­ally rid­ing with me. We re­ally need to cher­ish these spe­cial horses.”</p>
    <p>Gos­den, 69, de­scribes the horse as a “phe­nom­e­nal ath­lete” with great men­tal strength.</p>
    <p>“She is in the zone when racing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“She is like all great ath­letes. What sep­a­rates them from the or­di­nary ones is be­ing strong-minded.”</p>
    <p>This com­pet­i­tive streak ex­tends even to when she is out of the lime­light and do­ing or­di­nary train­ing gal­lops.</p>
    <p>“If she doesn’t go out first lot (on the gal­lops), she gets an­noyed that she has to wait,” said Gos­den.</p>
    <p>“She loves go­ing out there and car­ries her­self mag­nif­i­cently – she is a very proud per­son.”</p>
    <p>Gos­den said great horses like En­able, who has won more than £10 mil­lion (S$17.5 mil­lion) in prize money with 11 of her 15 wins com­ing in Group 1 races, give racing a rare chance to ex­tend its ap­peal out­side the sport.</p>
    <p>“Horses like her are in­cred­i­bly im­por­tant to our game,” he said.</p>
