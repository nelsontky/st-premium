    <p>A GOOD SHOW</p>
    <p>LONDON Dean Hen­der­son’s bid to re­place David de Gea as Manch­ester United’s first-choice goal­keeper got off to a solid start, as he made a key save in his be­lated de­but for the club in their 3-0 win at Lu­ton Town in the League Cup on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The former Eng­land Un­der-21 in­ter­na­tional was one of 10 changes made by man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer af­ter a dis­ap­point­ing 3-1 home de­feat by Crys­tal Palace on Satur­day in their open­ing game of the English Pre­mier League sea­son.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old, re­turn­ing to the club af­ter spend­ing last sea­son on loan at Sh­effield United, made a cru­cial stop to deny Tom Lock­yer as United went into the fi­nal 10 min­utes of their third-round tie with a slen­der 1-0 lead from Juan Mata’s penalty on the stroke of half-time.</p>
    <p>Hen­der­son, who be­fore Tues­day had yet to play for the team de­spite ar­riv­ing at Old Traf­ford nine years ago, kept the Cham­pi­onship out­fit at bay and the visi­tors went on to seal the vic­tory with late goals from sub­sti­tutes Mar­cus Rash­ford and Ma­son Green­wood.</p>
    <p>On the academy grad­u­ate’s solid dis­play be­tween the sticks, Sol­sk­jaer, whose side will play their fourth-round tie next week, said: “That is prob­a­bly the job our ’keep­ers some­times have to do, you have to make saves when needed. David has done that for years and Dean did that to­day.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing through is the big thing. There are some pos­i­tives, the</p>
    <p>’keeper does his j ob, we scored some nice goals to­wards the end, apart from that, it was a good work­out.”</p>
    <p>Hen­der­son could not hide his de­light later, tweet­ing: “I dreamt about this my whole life! Un­be­liev­able feel­ing to make my de­but for the club I love! Clean sheet and a win to top it off!”</p>
    <p>With de Gea put­ting on yet an­other er­ratic per­for­mance against Palace – a down­ward trend that has seen the Spain in­ter­na­tional make seven di­rect er­rors lead­ing to a goal in the past two terms – Hen­der­son could be line for a sec­ond suc­ces­sive start when Sol­sk­jaer’s men travel to Brighton in the top flight on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Call­ing him a “gen­uine con­tender” for the No. 1 shirt, former United mid­fielder Dar­ren Fletcher told Sky Sports: “He’s gone away to Sh­effield United, and did fan­tas­tic in the Cham­pi­onship (in 2018) and the Pre­mier League last year.</p>
    <p>“De Gea has a real chal­lenge on his hands now. Hen­der­son wants to be United’s No. 1 – he’s got the con­fi­dence, he’s got the ar­ro­gance, he be­lieves in him­self. He backs him­self and it’s go­ing to bring the best out of de Gea.”</p>
    <p>There are some pos­i­tives, the ’keeper does his job, we scored some nice goals to­wards the end... it was a good work­out.</p>
