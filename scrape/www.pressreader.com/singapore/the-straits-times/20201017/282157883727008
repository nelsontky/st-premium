    <p>New Silkroutes Group chair­man Goh Jin Hian and fi­nance di­rec­tor Wil­liam Teo Thiam Chuan have quit amid Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment (CAD) in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh quit “to de­vote more time to his per­sonal af­fairs”, while Mr Tan stepped down “to fo­cus on per­sonal mat­ters and to pur­sue other in­ter­ests”, the health­care firm said late on Thurs­day night.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier that morn­ing, New Silkroutes an­nounced that its au­di­tor Deloitte & Touche had is­sued a dis­claimer of opin­ion on the fi­nan­cial state­ments of the group for the fi­nan­cial year ended June 30.</p>
    <p>On Sept 30, the com­pany dis­closed that Dr Goh, the son of for­mer Sin­ga­pore prime min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong, and Mr Tan were be­ing in­ves­ti­gated by the CAD over a pos­si­ble of­fence un­der the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act.</p>
    <p>New Silkroutes said then that it un­der­stood that the al­leged of­fence was false trad­ing and mar­ket rig­ging to do with past share buy-backs and share acquisitio­ns.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh is also be­ing sued by the ju­di­cial man­agers of an un­re­lated firm – oil trader In­ter-Pa­cific Pe­tro­leum – over US$156 mil­lion (S$212 mil­lion) in losses it sus­tained due to his al­leged breach of du­ties when he was its di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>His res­ig­na­tion as New Silkroutes non-in­de­pen­dent and non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man comes just over a week af­ter he quit as chair­man of a sep­a­rate listed com­pany, Cordlife Group.</p>
    <p>Cordlife an­nounced, also late on Thurs­day and af­ter the New Silkroutes fil­ing, that Dr Goh had also re­signed as an in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor with im­me­di­ate ef­fect.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh was New Silkroutes chief ex­ec­u­tive from July 2015 un­til Oct 1 this year, when he took over as chair­man in a move an­nounced in July.</p>
    <p>Mr Kelvyn Oo Cheong Kwan, the firm’s for­mer chief cor­po­rate of­fi­cer and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor, is also as­sist­ing with the CAD probe. He re­signed from the com­pany on Aug 1.</p>
