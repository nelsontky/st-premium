    <p>Te­masek is in ac­tive talks to make its first di­rect i nvest­ment i n health­care and ed­u­ca­tion tech start-ups in South-east Asia, said its chief in­vest­ment strate­gist.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 out­break has fu­elled de­mand for dig­i­tal health and ed­u­ca­tion ser­vices, prompt­ing Sin­ga­pore’s in­vest­ment com­pany to re­view po­ten­tial tar­gets to add to its US$227 bil­lion (S$306 bil­lion) port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>Te­masek has been turn­ing its at­ten­tion to the two nascent sec­tors, though it has so far pre­ferred to in­vest in­di­rectly via ven­ture cap­i­tal funds that it backs in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“We see multi­bil­lion-dol­lar com­pa­nies emerg­ing from these sec­tors over the next few years,” Mr Ro­hit Si­pahi­malani, who also serves as head of South-east Asia at Te­masek, said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“We are in ac­tive di­a­logue with some of them right now and I wouldn’t be sur­prised if we do make an in­vest­ment.”</p>
    <p>He de­clined to iden­tify spe­cific tar­get com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The strat­egy un­der­scores Te­masek’s bet on South-east Asia’s dig­i­tal econ­omy, which is poised to triple to over US$300 bil­lion by 2025 af­ter growth cooled dur­ing the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to re­search it j ointly com­piled with Google and Bain & Co.</p>
    <p>Re­leased on Tues­day, the an­nual re­port, which pri­mar­ily stud­ies four key ar­eas, in­clud­ing ecom­merce, ded­i­cated a sec­tion to health and ed­u­ca­tion tech for the first time.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the pan­demic, ma­jor dig­i­tal health­care apps saw us­age in­crease by four times, while lead­ing ed­u­ca­tion apps were used three times more, the study showed.</p>
    <p>This has led to grow­ing in­vest­ment in coun­tries like In­done­sia, where there are not enough doc­tors and hos­pi­tals to meet the needs of the coun­try’s nearly 300 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In ed­u­ca­tion, a large por­tion of funds is go­ing into on­line learn­ing platforms. Last De­cem­ber, In­done­sia’s Ruang­guru raised US$150 mil­lion from in­vestors in­clud­ing EV Growth, a ven­ture cap­i­tal fund backed by Te­masek, mark­ing one of the largest fi­nanc­ing rounds for a South-east Asian start-up.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce will con­tinue to be an at­trac­tive area for Te­masek, Mr Si­pahi­malani said. Te­masek and Google have agreed to in­ject about US$350 mil­lion into In­done­sian on­line mar­ket­place Toko­pe­dia, Bloomberg News re­ported last month.</p>
    <p>The an­nual re­port showed that the re­gion will see a 63 per cent in­crease in e-com­merce gross mer­chan­dise value this year.</p>
