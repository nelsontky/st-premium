    <p>Video-stream­ing ser­vice iQiyi has com­mit­ted to mak­ing more Sin­ga­pore shows and dis­tribut­ing them glob­ally by work­ing with lo­cal pro­duc­tion houses.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese com­pany made this an­nounce­ment yes­ter­day at the launch of its in­ter­na­tional head­quar­ters in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>While the de­tails have yet to be firmed up, iQiyi has plans to make “more Sin­ga­porean sto­ries with Sin­ga­porean set­tings”, said Mr Kuek Yu-Chuang, 41, vice-pres­i­dent for in­ter­na­tional busi­ness at iQiyi.</p>
    <p>Started in 2010, iQiyi has been de­scribed as the No. 2 player in China’s video-stream­ing mar­ket, with 104.8 mil­lion sub­scribers as at Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The dec­la­ra­tion fol­lows the film­ing of its first Sin­ga­pore col­lab­o­ra­tion, The Fer­ry­man: Leg­ends Of Nanyang, with lo­cal pro­duc­tion com­pany G.H.Y. Cul­ture and Me­dia. It is slated for re­lease next year.</p>
    <p>Adapted from iQiyi’s 2014 show Soul Ferry, the drama series stars Lawrence Wong from the pop­u­lar his­tor­i­cal drama Story Of Yanxi Palace, with lo­cal ac­tors Qi Yu Wu, Tay Ping Hui and Xiang Yun.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal pro­duc­tion houses and the me­dia author­ity wel­comed the move to col­lab­o­rate and in­no­vate.</p>
    <p>“A lot of lo­cal me­dia com­pa­nies have tried to pen­e­trate the China mar­ket, which isn’t easy due to the many rules... and the dif­fer­ent au­di­ence there,” said Mr Lim Teck, 45, manag­ing di­rec­tor of Clover Films.</p>
    <p>“Part­ner­ing an es­tab­lished com­pany like iQiyi is help­ful to Sin­ga­porean firms as it has the knowhow on mak­ing content work in China. In turn, we can help to dis­trib­ute content to parts of South­east Asia.”</p>
    <p>Mr Howie Lau, as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive for me­dia and in­no­va­tion at the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity, said: “This is an ex­cit­ing time for Asian content, and iQiyi’s an­chor­ing in Sin­ga­pore is tes­ta­ment to the at­trac­tive­ness of our city state as the place for lead­ing cor­po­ra­tions to ex­pand their re­gional pres­ence.”</p>
    <p>As a tech­nol­ogy com­pany, iQiyi plans to ex­pand into South-east Asia and be­yond.</p>
    <p>This be­gan in June last year, when its in­ter­na­tional app made content avail­able in lan­guages such as Thai and Viet­namese.</p>
    <p>Mr Kuek said: “We’ve cho­sen Sin­ga­pore to an­chor our in­ter­na­tional op­er­a­tions as Sin­ga­pore’s con­nec­tiv­ity and rep­u­ta­tion as a prime tal­ent hub makes it the ideal gate­way to ramp up our global op­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>He hopes to grow the cur­rent staff of 25 to more than 200 in the next five years. Apart from Sin­ga­pore, iQiyi has of­fices in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Manila, Dubai and Toronto.</p>
    <p>iQiyi chief ex­ec­u­tive Gong Yu said the com­pany is also ex­pand­ing its in­ter­na­tional team in the Philip­pines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thai­land.</p>
