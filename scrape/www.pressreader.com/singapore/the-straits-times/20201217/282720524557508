    <p>Lo­cal ac­tor Joshua Ang, known for act­ing in the com­edy film I Not Stupid (2002), an­nounced on In­sta­gram on Mon­day he has de­cided to di­vorce for­mer air stew­ardess Shan­non Low.</p>
    <p>They mar­ried in March 2018. Quot­ing Vic­to­rian play­wright Os­car Wilde, he said “di­vorces are made in heaven” and asked the pub­lic to con­grat­u­late him.</p>
    <p>Ms Low, 29, hit back by post­ing a slew of ac­cu­sa­tions against Ang, 31, in­clud­ing that he has a new girl­friend, on In­sta­gram Sto­ries on Tues­day night.</p>
    <p>She told The Straits Times she de­cided to go pub­lic with her al­le­ga­tions on so­cial me­dia be­cause “it is my duty to stand up for my son and my­self”.</p>
    <p>Ang told ST the al­le­ga­tions were not true and said he is cur­rently sin­gle.</p>
    <p>He is plan­ning to file defama­tion charges af­ter she al­leged that he had been vi­o­lent to­wards her.</p>
    <p>He said: “I am bring­ing this to court be­cause I want to pro­tect my rep­u­ta­tion. I will spare no ex­pense.”</p>
    <p>Ang is also fil­ing an ac­cess or­der to see his son on week­ends. Both par­ties con­firmed that Ang has not seen his two-year-old son for more than 190 days.</p>
    <p>Ms Low told ST she had filed a per­sonal pro­tec­tion or­der against her hus­band, which was ul­ti­mately not granted.</p>
    <p>She also re­futed the claims made by Ang in lo­cal me­dia re­ports that she had asked him for money.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have agreed to di­vorce for­mally next March, when they are al­lowed to legally do so af­ter three years of mar­riage.</p>
    <p>Ang, who is cur­rently pro­mot­ing the Jack Neo movie The Diam Diam Era, says the mar­riage be­gan to frac­ture early this year.</p>
    <p>He moved out of their mat­ri­mo­nial home in June.</p>
