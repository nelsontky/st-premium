    <p>In this week’s East Asia Watch col­umn, global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Goh Sui Noi (be­low) looks at the legacy of Lee Teng-hui, the former Tai­wan pres­i­dent who died last month, and his un­ful­filled dream that Tai­wan, with its de­vel­oped econ­omy and lib­eral democ­racy, would be “the model for a fu­ture re­uni­fied China”.</p>
    <p>The year 2000 was a mo­men­tous one for the Tai­wanese.</p>
    <p>In March, amid threats of dire con­se­quences from Bei­jing, they voted out the Kuom­intang (KMT), which had ruled the is­land for more than five decades, in favour of the in­de­pen­dence-lean­ing Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party (DPP).</p>
    <p>It was the first power trans­fer in Tai­wan – a peace­ful one at that, de­cided through the bal­lot box.</p>
    <p>But protests broke out out­side the KMT head­quar­ters fol­low­ing the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion. Riot po­lice brought out wa­ter can­non to clear a path for the in­cum­bent, Pres­i­dent Lee Teng-hui.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, who had led Tai­wan for 12 years from 1988, was the ob­ject of the protesters’ anger, for they be­lieved he had robbed the KMT of a victory by favour­ing un­pop­u­lar vice-pres­i­dent Lien Chan as can­di­date over a more pop­u­lar party mem­ber. Some even said he had covertly sup­ported the DPP’s can­di­date, Mr Chen Shui-bian. Mr Lee re­signed as chair­man of the KMT that March.</p>
    <p>In his 12 years as pres­i­dent, he was widely viewed as hav­ing played a huge role in Tai­wan’s tran­si­tion from au­thor­i­tar­ian rule to a vi­brant democ­racy. The power trans­fer that he over­saw in 2000 was the cul­mi­na­tion of demo­cratic re­forms that he had put in place, con­tin­u­ing with the work his pre­de­ces­sor Chi­ang Ching-kuo had be­gun.</p>
    <p>It is not for noth­ing that Mr Lee, who died last month aged 97, was known as “Mr Democ­racy” or the “fa­ther of democ­racy” in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>But his legacy ex­tends be­yond the democrati­sa­tion process.</p>
    <p>He is cred­ited with adopt­ing a prag­matic ap­proach to diplo­macy to broaden the is­land’s in­ter­na­tional space, and con­duct­ing cross-strait ties on the ba­sis that Tai­wan is no rene­gade prov­ince of the Chi­nese</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nist Party-ruled main­land China but a po­lit­i­cal en­tity, the Repub­lic of China (ROC) on a par with the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China (PRC).</p>
    <p>He also presided over an era that saw the Tai­wanese de­velop a stronger sense of lo­cal iden­tity.</p>
    <p>NA­TIVE-BORN PRES­I­DENT</p>
    <p>Mr Lee was born in 1923, when Tai­wan was un­der Ja­panese rule (hav­ing been ceded by the Qing dynasty in 1895), which ex­plains why he spoke Ja­panese and Hokkien – a com­mon di­alect in Tai­wan – more flu­ently than Man­darin. He was also much in­flu­enced by Ja­panese thought, hav­ing had a Ja­panese ed­u­ca­tion right up to univer­sity level at the Ky­oto Im­pe­rial Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>His fa­ther was a small land owner in the ru­ral dis­trict of Sanchih, so his child­hood ex­pe­ri­ences in­cluded see­ing ten­ant farm­ers and their sub­servience to land own­ers.</p>
    <p>This was to in­flu­ence his de­ci­sion to study agri­cul­tural eco­nom­ics at univer­sity and his at­trac­tion to Marx­ism. He went on to earn a doc­tor­ate in agri­cul­tural eco­nom­ics in 1968 at Cor­nell Univer­sity in the United States, but aban­doned Marx­ism as too con­cep­tual and not ap­pli­ca­ble to eco­nomic anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>He was briefly a mem­ber of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) in 1946, but left be­cause “all it cared about was win­ning po­lit­i­cal power rather than peo­ple’s lives and the coun­try’s fu­ture”, he said in 2013.</p>
    <p>Be­fore join­ing pol­i­tics, he taught at uni­ver­si­ties and worked at the US-sup­ported Joint Com­mis­sion on Ru­ral Re­con­struc­tion in Tai­wan, where he con­trib­uted to the es­tab­lish­ment of farm­ers’ as­so­ci­a­tions, ir­ri­ga­tion sys­tems and ru­ral health pro­grammes, among other things.</p>
    <p>His work was no­ticed, and in</p>
    <p>1972, he be­came a min­is­ter without port­fo­lio, over­see­ing agri­cul­ture.</p>
    <p>As Taipei mayor from 1978 to 1981, he built in­cin­er­a­tors and re­lo­cated fac­to­ries out of the city to the coun­try­side – and went on to be Tai­wan prov­ince gover­nor be­fore be­com­ing vice-pres­i­dent in 1984.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew, who met Mr Lee sev­eral times from when he was Taipei mayor, de­scribed him in his mem­oirs as a vo­ra­cious reader with an enor­mous ca­pac­ity for ab­sorb­ing in­for­ma­tion and who was com­pe­tent and in­dus­tri­ous.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee was a na­tive Tai­wanese, or ben­shen­gren – de­scen­dants of ethnic Chi­nese, mainly from Fu­jian prov­ince, who had moved to Tai­wan in the 400 years be­fore 1949. He was in­ducted into the KMT at a time when Mr Chi­ang was in­creas­ing the par­tic­i­pa­tion of Tai­wanese in the party.</p>
    <p>The KMT had fled the Chi­nese main­land in 1949 af­ter los­ing the civil war to the CCP and re­treated to Tai­wan, where it con­tin­ued its claim to be the le­git­i­mate gov­ern­ment of the whole of China, un­der the name Repub­lic of China, the coun­try’s for­mal name from 1912, af­ter the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911. The Chi­nese who fled with the party are known as main­lan­ders, or waishen­gren.</p>
    <p>Mr Chi­ang also lifted the ban on the for­ma­tion of new po­lit­i­cal par­ties in 1987 and ended mar­tial law, im­posed in 1947 af­ter what is known as the Feb 28, 1947 in­ci­dent. An al­ter­ca­tion be­tween a na­tive Tai­wanese cig­a­rette seller and the po­lice on Feb 27 that year led to protests the next day in which po­lice fired into the crowds, killing a few peo­ple and spark­ing upris­ings which led to thou­sands dy­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee be­came pres­i­dent in 1988, fol­low­ing the death of Mr Chi­ang. He con­tin­ued with the lo­cal­i­sa­tion of the KMT and the democrati­sa­tion process.</p>
    <p>His mo­ti­va­tion was in part to shore up his own vul­ner­a­ble po­si­tion in the party, as he was fac­ing pres­sure from con­ser­va­tive main­lan­ders within the KMT. Some of them were seek­ing his ouster.</p>
    <p>Through pop­u­lar elec­tions of the Na­tional As­sem­bly and the Leg­isla­tive Yuan, he was able to in­crease the num­ber of Tai­wanese in gov­ern­ment and thus his own hold on the KMT and the is­land.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the need to lo­calise the KMT, he said in 1994 that the KMT was a regime that “came from the out­side”, and that the peo­ple of Tai­wan had suf­fered greatly un­der outsiders, in­clud­ing the KMT.</p>
    <p>He com­pared him­self to the bi­b­li­cal fig­ure of Moses, who led the Is­raelites out of slav­ery in an­cient</p>
    <p>Egypt. Tai­wan ex­pert Richard Bush, in Un­ty­ing The Knot: Mak­ing Peace In The Tai­wan Strait, wrote that Mr Lee was de­scrib­ing how he saw him­self as lead­ing the peo­ple of Tai­wan out of past re­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>But Mr Lee’s re­marks on Moses and the ex­o­dus were in­ter­preted by Bei­jing as his want­ing to lead Tai­wan out of China and there­fore hav­ing sep­a­ratist in­ten­tions.</p>
    <p>THE ‘NEW TAI­WANESE’</p>
    <p>In 1996, at his inau­gu­ra­tion af­ter be­com­ing the first di­rectly elected pres­i­dent, he in­tro­duced the con­cept of “new Tai­wanese”, in which ev­ery­one liv­ing in Tai­wan, re­gard­less of when their an­ces­tors had ar­rived, was part of a sin­gle “com­mu­nity of shared fate”.</p>
    <p>He also be­gan the re­vi­sion of school texts to teach more of Tai­wan’s his­tory, not just the main­land’s. As he wrote in his book, The Road To Democ­racy –</p>
    <p>Tai­wan’s Pur­suit Of Iden­tity: “I be­lieve that be­fore we do any­thing else, Tai­wan has to get its own house firmly in or­der. If Tai­wan’s iden­tity is not com­pletely clear to its peo­ple, how can we deal with main­land China?”</p>
    <p>But Tai­wan ex­pert Shel­ley Rig­ger wrote that Mr Lee’s ef­forts to unite the Tai­wanese be­hind a shared vi­sion of an ROC that would be friendly with the PRC did not en­tirely suc­ceed. This was be­cause on one side were the pro-uni­fi­ca­tion con­ser­va­tives, and on the other a pow­er­ful en­thu­si­asm for Tai­wanese iden­tity that was sweep­ing the is­land.</p>
    <p>Still, Mr Yan Jiann-fa, a former head of China af­fairs at the DPP, thought Mr Lee did much to sta­bilise Tai­wanese so­ci­ety at a time of great divi­sion be­tween the pro-uni­fi­ca­tion blue camp and the pro-Tai­wani­sa­tion in­de­pen­dence-lean­ing green camp that placed an em­pha­sis on Tai­wanese cul­ture and his­tory.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the Feb 28, 1947 in­ci­dent had sparked the rise of the Tai­wanese iden­tity, Mr Yan said that af­ter the end of mar­tial law, Mr Lee’s ac­com­mo­da­tion of the pro-Tai­wani­sa­tion fac­tions meant there was less con­flict in so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Mr Yan added that Mr Lee’s lo­cal­i­sa­tion of the KMT pro­longed the party’s rule. But con­ser­va­tives in the KMT re­viled Mr Lee for weak­en­ing the party by caus­ing some to leave to form other par­ties and by sup­port­ing the opposition.</p>
    <p>CROSS-STRAIT TIES</p>
    <p>In 1987, Mr Chi­ang had lifted the ban on travel to the main­land, mainly to al­low el­derly main­lan­ders to visit fam­i­lies left be­hind in 1949.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee later ex­panded ex­changes to in­clude eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion at a time when China was open­ing up to for­eign in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>In 1991, he recog­nised CCP rule on the main­land, uni­lat­er­ally ended the civil war with the CCP – which tech­ni­cally had not ended, as the two sides had not signed an armistice or peace treaty – and be­gan ne­go­ti­a­tions with Bei­jing, with uni­fi­ca­tion as the ul­ti­mate goal. A se­ries of se­cret meet­ings cul­mi­nated in the 1993 talks in Sin­ga­pore, at which the two sides worked out agree­ments on tech­ni­cal mat­ters such as mail de­liv­ery. It was a high point in cross-strait ties.</p>
    <p>At the same time as he was hold­ing talks with the main­land, Mr Lee was also pur­su­ing what he termed “prag­matic diplo­macy” to win in­ter­na­tional sup­port and im­prove Tai­wan’s bar­gain­ing power with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>As he put it in his book, Tai­wan needs re­la­tions with other coun­tries to make cer­tain that it ex­ists. “For­mal diplo­matic re­la­tions are, of course, the best, but when that is im­pos­si­ble, prac­ti­cal re­la­tions cen­tring on eco­nomic ties are ef­fec­tive as well. Should even eco­nomic links be dif­fi­cult, then cul­tural ties should be pur­sued,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Wary of bur­geon­ing eco­nomic ties, he also be­gan the “no haste, be pa­tient” pol­icy to slow down Tai­wanese in­vest­ments in the main­land and the Go South pol­icy to en­cour­age Tai­wanese busi­nesses to in­vest in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>These poli­cies were largely un­suc­cess­ful, in part be­cause of the United States’ own en­gage­ment pol­icy with China and the busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties on the main­land as it opened up, and also be­cause of the 1997-1998 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The New South­bound pol­icy of cur­rent Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen has bet­ter suc­cess be­cause of ris­ing trade ten­sions be­tween China and the US as well as the Covid-19 pan­demic that is caus­ing com­pa­nies to di­ver­sify their sup­ply chains away from China.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee’s prag­matic diplo­macy in­cluded visits to friendly coun­tries with which Tai­wan had no diplo­matic ties. One of the first coun­tries he vis­ited was Sin­ga­pore, in 1989. He later vis­ited the Philip­pines, In­done­sia and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>But it was his visit to the US in 1995, dur­ing which he spoke at his alma mater Cor­nell, that in­vited the ire of the Chi­nese. They saw it as a be­trayal by the US, which had promised to keep ties with Tai­wan un­of­fi­cial, and by Mr Lee, whose ref­er­ence to the ROC in his speech was seen as proof that he wanted to cre­ate an in­de­pen­dent Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing can­celled sched­uled talks be­tween the two sides and launched mil­i­tary ex­er­cises in the Tai­wan Strait.</p>
    <p>It was not till 1999 that an­other ma­jor meet­ing was sched­uled, but this was again scuttled, this time by Mr Lee’s char­ac­ter­is­ing ties with the main­land as spe­cial state-to-state re­la­tions, which to the Chi­nese was fur­ther proof that he was a sep­a­ratist.</p>
    <p>Yet, Mr Lee’s re­marks merely clar­i­fied what had been Tai­wan’s po­si­tion on cross-strait ties: that the two sides were equal po­lit­i­cal en­ti­ties of a di­vided China, and that Tai­wan’s gov­ern­ment pos­sessed sovereignt­y just as Bei­jing did. It said noth­ing about Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Af­ter leav­ing the KMT, Mr Lee gave his sup­port to the green camp but said pub­licly in 2007 that he “never ad­vo­cated Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence” be­cause the is­land was “in fact an in­de­pen­dent sov­er­eign coun­try”.</p>
    <p>If there was to be uni­fi­ca­tion, to Mr Lee, it could hap­pen only af­ter the two sides’ eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal sys­tems con­verged. And Tai­wan, with its de­vel­oped econ­omy and lib­eral democ­racy, would be “the model for a fu­ture re­uni­fied China”, he wrote.</p>
    <p>That did not hap­pen in his life­time. He would have hoped that those who came af­ter him would work towards it.</p>
