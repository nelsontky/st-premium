    <p>It was an in­stinc­tive fin­ish and of­fered a glimpse of Khairin Nadim’s scor­ing po­ten­tial as he wrote his name into the record books.</p>
    <p>The Young Li­ons striker’s goal in his team’s 3-1 de­feat by Tampines Rovers on Tues­day night meant that, at 16 years and 194 days old, he be­came the third-youngest player to score in the Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL).</p>
    <p>He missed na­tional cap­tain</p>
    <p>Hariss Harun’s mark by only 20 days, a mile­stone he prob­a­bly would have over­taken had the pan­demic not halted the SPL for seven months.</p>
    <p>He has quickly moved on from that missed op­por­tu­nity and, while time is on his side, he is not plan­ning to waste any.</p>
    <p>Ahead of today’s game against Balestier Khalsa, Khairin told The Straits Times: “The feel­ing (of ac­com­plish­ment) from scor­ing my first goal is gone al­ready, and now I want to do much more.</p>
    <p>“It took me a few games to score that first goal, so to be hon­est I was not too happy.</p>
    <p>“There are six more games this sea­son, and I want at least two more goals. Only then can I be a lit­tle bit more sat­is­fied.”</p>
    <p>He does own one record though – the league’s youngest player, af­ter he made his de­but aged 15 years and 298 days as a sub­sti­tute against Hougang United in March. He has fea­tured in eight of the Young Li­ons nine matches this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Young Li­ons coach Nazri Nasir was ef­fu­sive in his praise for his bud­ding for­ward.</p>
    <p>“When I see him in train­ing or on the pitch, I some­times for­get he is 16,” said the for­mer Li­ons skip­per.</p>
    <p>“He has got a good foot­ball brain and con­fi­dence, and I never had a doubt he would get his goal.”</p>
    <p>Call­ing Khairin a hard worker and team player, Nazri noted the young­ster will need to de­velop phys­i­cally to com­pete against big­ger and stronger de­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>The Wood­lands Sec­ondary School stu­dent is fill­ing out nicely. He has grown more than 10cm to 1.72m since the start of this year and has also gained 10kg to his cur­rent 63kg.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged he is far from the fin­ished prod­uct.</p>
    <p>“I need to im­prove my strength be­cause I am quite weak in the air, and in one-on-one chal­lenges with de­fend­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>Nazri could take the reins of the Un­der-22 squad for the SEA</p>
    <p>Games in Viet­nam next Novem­ber – a head coach has not been for­mally an­nounced – and is sat­is­fied with his play­ers’ de­vel­op­ment in this trun­cated league cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The team, most of whom are play­ing in their first SPL sea­son, are still sus­cep­ti­ble to oc­ca­sional “school­boy mis­takes”, but the 49-year-old coach said he has seen a pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ment in their tac­ti­cal aware­ness.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects about two-thirds of the squad, in­clud­ing Khairin, to be in con­tention for the bi­en­nial Games.</p>
    <p>There have been some com­mend­able per­for­mances this term. Against top clubs Tampines, Hougang United and the Lion City Sailors, the Young Li­ons ei­ther led or kept the scores level at half­time.</p>
    <p>They even­tu­ally lost all three games, partly be­cause their op­po­nents were no longer re­quired to field three U-23 play­ers in their line-up af­ter the in­ter­val, ac­cord­ing to league rules.</p>
    <p>“This is where I told my play­ers we need to stay very fo­cused and min­imise mis­takes,” said Nazri.</p>
    <p>“The men­tal as­pect is the most im­por­tant part for them to im­prove now, be­cause it is also key at in­ter­na­tional level.”</p>
