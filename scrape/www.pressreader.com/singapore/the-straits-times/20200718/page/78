Cai Dexian takes pride in a profession that contribute­s to the security of Singapore oining the military was a natural choice for Colonel (COL) Cai Dexian. Even as a teenager, he wanted to play a part in building a better future for Singapore. He also desired to work in an environmen­t that requires strong teamwork. A military profession in the Army was the ideal fit for him after honing his leadership skills during his years as a rugby player and student council member in school.
In 2003, COL Cai was awarded The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Scholarshi­p. He graduated with a double degree in Economics and Internatio­nal Studies from Stanford University. positions, where I help design policies for the Army and the SAF.”
He considers his six-month deployment to Afghanista­n in 2012 as one of his biggest career highlights. As part of the multi-national coalition force, he saw how crucial it was for the military to partner with civil agencies in rebuilding a country. “Seeing the trials and tribulatio­ns of the Afghan people brought home the point that we should never take our security for granted,” he says.
Helming the Ministry of Defence’s (MINDEF) Personnel Policy department from 2016 to 2019 was another fulfilling experience for him. “My team and I developed human resource policies that had a direct impact on our regular servicemen and women. It was very meaningful knowing that we were helping to determine whether MINDEF and the SAF could remain an attractive career choice for good people.” Having to lead a team of non-uniformed Defence Executive Officers ( DXOs) was also a new experience for him. “I learnt to adapt my leadership style to take a more collaborat­ive and consultati­ve approach. My colleagues are very experience­d and profession­al. They taught me a great deal about policymaki­ng and listening to diverse perspectiv­es.” Making a difference well and ensuring they are capable of and committed to defending our country. Seeing the growth and developmen­t of my soldiers and my team during our time together is probably the most rewarding part of being an officer.”
For those considerin­g a MINDEF/SAF profession, COL Cai has this piece of advice: “Rather than the scholarshi­p, think about the career you would like to have: What experience­s would you want to have? What makes you happy and fulfilled, and what difference would you want to make? Thinking about these questions will give you a clearer sense of the career you want to pursue.” Holistic developmen­t Currently, COL Cai is the Commander of the 8th Singapore Armoured Brigade. He is responsibl­e for ensuring that the units under his charge have the space, time, equipment and manpower to be operationa­lly ready and capable to undertake any mission assigned to them.
One of his responsibi­lities this year involves coordinati­ng extensivel­y with other public agencies and grassroots organisati­ons to bring the National Day Parade experience to people across Singapore.
He says: “Command in the SAF is a sacred responsibi­lity. It’s about leading our soldiers In his decade-long career with the Army, COL Cai has taken on a variety of appointmen­ts, including a commander of an armoured infantry company, brigade operations officer, and plans officer in the Army’s Force Transforma­tion office.
The variety and scale of career opportunit­ies have been very exciting,” he says. “I like that I got placed in new situations that forced me to learn and adapt quickly. I also wanted something that would allow me to alternate between command appointmen­ts, where I would be leading soldiers, and staff S Defenders of the sea ince the early years of Singapore, our island has depended heavily on the safe and open maritime trade routes around its waters to fuel its economic prosperity. As our maritime nation’s first line of defence, the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) has been entrusted with the vital role of protecting our economic lifeline while contributi­ng to regional peace and security.
“Being defenders of the seas, I feel that our impact goes beyond what is seen in the public. Many of us are lulled into a sense of security that Singapore is very safe, but the truth is far from that. I am proud that I am contributi­ng to the seaward defence of Singapore, together with other national agencies,” says Senior Lieutenant Colonel (SLTC) Siswi Herlini, the Commanding Officer (CO) of RSS
(an class Landing Ship Tank).
As the CO, SLTC Herlini is not only responsibl­e for the operationa­l readiness of the ship. She also takes charge of her crew’s morale, discipline and, very importantl­y, profession­al developmen­t. five job did not appeal to me too,” recalls SLTC Herlini, who is currently enjoying the dynamic and exciting work opportunit­ies offered in the RSN.
After she was awarded the SAF Merit Scholarshi­p in 2003, she went on to pursue a bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineerin­g at the University of California, Berkeley in 2006 and a master’s in Civil and Environmen­tal Engineerin­g at Stanford University in 2007. From defending the seas to nurturing outstandin­g sailors in the Republic of Singapore Navy, Senior Lieutenant Colonel Siswi Herlini dedicates her best efforts to ensure that Singapore’s waters are safe and secure Continuous learning Being a mother of two has not stopped SLTC Herlini from continuing to take on various job challenges. Over the course of her RSN career, she has undertaken different roles such as the CO of RSS (a
class Patrol Vessel) and the Head of the RSN Strategy Office at the Headquarte­rs.
“I still love my job in the RSN even after 13 years — it’s meaningful work,” she shares.
Other than the regular competency trainings that the officers go through, SLTC Herlini also had the opportunit­y to attend the Command and Staff College in Australia. “Not only did I develop profession­ally, I also learnt how different cultures view the same thing from different perspectiv­es. I realised the need to be sensitive while embracing diversity.”
“Being part of the RSN is more than just a career — it’s a calling,” she adds. “The journey is not easy but many of us remain because of the conviction that what we are doing, and what we are a part of, are larger than ourselves. We need to have our hearts in the right place to enjoy this tough but satisfying profession.” Resilience Fear- Endurance less- Endurance- Getting on board SLTC Herlini has been fascinated by the military profession since she was a junior college student, especially when her male classmates discussed Basic Military Training. Initially, she thought that the military profession was only for men until she saw a poster of women in military uniform during a career fair in school. It was at that moment that she decided to join the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).
“I did not want to join an organisati­on that cared only about profit-making. An eight-to- M Safeguardi­ng Singapore’s skies A fulfilling journey Embracing change ajor (MAJ) Yap Zhe Liang Kenn was only nine years old when the September 11 terrorist attacks happened in 2001. The prevalence of terrorist threats globally left an indelible impression on him and influenced his decision to embark on a career in the military in the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF).
Currently a Battery Commander in the 3rd Divisional Air Defence Battalion (3 DA Bn), MAJ Yap leads a team that performs critical air defence duties. These include manning the RBS-70 short-range air defence missile system that helps protect Singapore’s skies, as well as maintainin­g the operationa­l standards, training and developmen­t of his unit.
In addition, he assists his Commanding Officer to plan and execute current operations, as well as chart longer-term developmen­ts for the unit.
Says MAJ Yap: “It’s important that I choose a career that offers dynamic experience­s and serves a meaningful purpose. The mission of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) resonates the most with me because my generation has been able to live and grow up in a safe environmen­t due to the contributi­ons of those who came before us. And now it’s my turn to do my part.” A recipient of the SAF Merit Scholarshi­p in 2012, MAJ Yap pursued a double degree in Accountanc­y and Business at Nanyang Technologi­cal University. During his studies, he was attached to various RSAF units to learn about operations within the organisati­on. Since his return, his appointmen­ts have taken him on overseas training exercises in Australia, South Africa and Thailand.
After graduation, MAJ Yap served as a Platoon Commander in 3 DA Bn where he trained and worked closely with servicemen. As a leader, he was constantly challenged to communicat­e effectivel­y with his team, which made him a stronger soldier and a better individual.
He says: “Every serviceman comes from a different background and responds differentl­y to motivation and learning techniques. I’ve learnt to adjust my style to engage them and to treat every interactio­n as a new one, drawing from the lessons of past experience­s.”
One of MAJ Yap’s contributi­ons is his involvemen­t as a Staff Officer in the organisati­on’s transforma­tion into the Next Generation SAF, led by the Joint Plans and Transforma­tion Department. As a Force Transforma­tion Officer, MAJ Yap found his role fulfilling because he had the opportunit­y to leave a significan­t and long-lasting impact on the future of the organisati­on. MAJ Yap recognises that dealing with change on a regular basis is part of the job and he is thankful to have a good support system.
Whenever he encounters a problem, he finds it useful to discuss his perspectiv­es and ideas with his team, peers and superiors. He says he also values the sharing sessions and dialogues with the senior officers who have been through similar experience­s in their own journeys.
MAJ Yap says: “With the strong mentoring culture and emphasis on growth within the RSAF, I’ve benefited greatly from the advice of my mentors and seniors — from the time I was going through the scholarshi­p interview process to my recent preparatio­n for my appointmen­t as a Battery Commander.
“I’ve found that, besides the profession­al developmen­t courses we get to attend, serving as a ground commander also provides valuable learning opportunit­ies and develops my leadership skills.
“There are many opportunit­ies for you to learn more and even experience what a profession in MINDEF/ SAF is like. I strongly encourage all who are considerin­g a MINDEF/ SAF profession to find out more by speaking to our in-service officers,” MAJ Yap advises.
