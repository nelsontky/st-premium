    <p>LONDON • Jur­gen Klopp be­lieves his Liver­pool play­ers should be proud of their “ruth­less fin­ish­ing”, af­ter the Reds ended a three­month wait for an away win in the Pre­mier League with a 7-0 thrash­ing of Crys­tal Palace yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In an omi­nous sign for the chal­lengers hop­ing to de­throne the Mersey­side club as English cham­pi­ons, Liver­pool built on the mo­men­tum of a last-minute win­ner that beat Tot­ten­ham 2-1 in mid­week.</p>
    <p>Roberto Firmino and Mo­hamed Salah scored twice at Sel­hurst Park, while Takumi Mi­namino, Sa­dio Mane and Jor­dan Hen­der­son also net­ted.</p>
    <p>“It was hard work as well as ruth­less fin­ish­ing,” Klopp said af­ter the match on BT Sport.</p>
    <p>“We had a lot of calm in the mo­ments. They had their mo­ments, 100 per cent, but our fin­ish­ing in the first half was re­ally clin­i­cal.</p>
    <p>“I’m not think­ing the game is fin­ished (at 3-0) at half-time. We had to stay con­cen­trated. That was the chal­lenge. We con­trolled the game and scored won­der­ful goals.</p>
    <p>“This is a very in­tense pe­riod but it clicked to­day. The boys should be re­ally proud.”</p>
    <p>The Liver­pool man­ager has re­peat­edly be­moaned hav­ing to play Satur­day lunchtime kick-offs af­ter Wed­nes­day night games, but his side suf­fered no hang­over from their ex­er­tions against Spurs.</p>
    <p>Salah was given a rare rest from the start, but his Ja­panese re­place­ment Mi­namino took just three min­utes to open the scor­ing when he was teed up by Mane for his first Pre­mier League goal.</p>
    <p>Mane then ended his long­est goal drought as a Liver­pool player at nine games with an ex­cel­lent fin­ish from Firmino’s pass.</p>
    <p>A clin­i­cal counter-at­tack made it three be­fore the break as this time Firmino latched on to Andy Robert­son’s cross be­fore flick­ing the ball be­yond Vi­cente Guaita.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool had not won in their pre­vi­ous five league games. They have al­ready dropped more points this cam­paign than they had be­fore seal­ing a first league ti­tle in 30 years last sea­son.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Klopp’s men have sur­vived an in­jury cri­sis and, with more play­ers re­turn­ing to fit­ness, are now in pole po­si­tion to re­tain their ti­tle.</p>
    <p>Trent Alexan­der-Arnold is one of those to have re­turned in re­cent weeks af­ter a month out and the Eng­land in­ter­na­tional’s pass was swept home by Hen­der­son from out­side the box to make it 4-0.</p>
    <p>Klopp then took the chance to give Mane a rest, but the Sene­galese voiced his frus­tra­tion at be­ing re­moved from the game and re­placed by Salah.</p>
    <p>The Egyp­tian for­ward played his part for the fifth with the pass to Firmino, who has now scored as many goals (three) in his last two games than his pre­vi­ous 27 Pre­mier League ap­pear­ances.</p>
    <p>Salah then moved to the top of this sea­son’s Pre­mier League goalscor­ing charts with a late dou­ble. He headed home from a cor­ner be­fore bend­ing a stun­ning ef­fort into the top cor­ner.</p>
    <p>Vic­tory en­sured Liver­pool – who had only 14 shots on goal, eight of which were on tar­get and seven went in – will lead the league at Christ­mas for a third suc­ces­sive sea­son. On this ev­i­dence, they will take some catch­ing in the new year.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool cap­tain Hen­der­son agreed with Klopp’s as­sess­ment of the Reds’ per­for­mance, say­ing on BT Sport: “I thought we were ruth­less to­day and took our chances, which is al­ways im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“In cer­tain ways it was our best per­for­mance of the sea­son. We dom­i­nated the game for large pe­ri­ods but I still thought we were sloppy at times.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, we’re de­lighted with the per­for­mance.”</p>
    <p>Palace man­ager Roy Hodg­son, mean­while, ad­mit­ted that it was a crush­ing de­feat for his side.</p>
    <p>“There’s noth­ing pos­i­tive I can say. We’re hu­mil­i­ated by the re­sult, we take it very badly. It’s a new ex­pe­ri­ence for most of us,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I can’t think of any­thing pos­i­tive to say at all. I’m still try­ing to come to terms with a 7-0 de­feat at home, al­beit by a very good team.</p>
    <p>“First time I’ve suf­fered it, and many oth­ers in the dress­ing room.</p>
    <p>“A day or two of griev­ing, I feel. We just have to come over it and learn some lessons from it. I’m sure we will.”</p>
