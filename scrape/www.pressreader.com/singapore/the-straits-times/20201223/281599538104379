    <p>There were 29 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, of which all were im­ported, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,461.</p>
    <p>They were placed on stay-home no­tice or iso­lated on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s im­ported fig­ure is the high­est since March 28, when there were 42 such cases.</p>
    <p>It is also the high­est daily count since Sept 21, when 31 cases were re­ported — nine im­ported and 22 from within work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Among the im­ported cases yes­ter­day, four were Sin­ga­pore­ans or per­ma­nent res­i­dents and 23 are for­eign­ers who are cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, in­clud­ing 21 for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers who hold work per­mits.</p>
    <p>No new com­mu­nity cases and none from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries were re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In an up­date last night, MOH said the sole lo­cally trans­mit­ted case re­ported on Mon­day had a pos­i­tive sero­log­i­cal test, in­di­cat­ing a likely past in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said on Mon­day that on Dec 14, the 39-year-old woman and her fam­ily had gone on a South­ern Is­lands tour with two other fam­i­lies, and their group had 12 peo­ple in all. This is seven more than the five al­lowed in phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>Of the 29 im­ported cases an­nounced yes­ter­day, three are Sin­ga­pore­ans who re­turned from the United States, Costa Rica and Indonesia, and one is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who re­turned from In­dia.</p>
    <p>An­other two are work pass hold­ers who ar­rived from the Philip­pines and the United States.</p>
    <p>The 21 for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore ar­rived from the Philip­pines, Indonesia and Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing two im­ported cases are short-term visit pass hold­ers. One, a 46-year-old fe­male In­dian na­tional, ar­rived here from In­dia to visit a Sin­ga­porean rel­a­tive, while the other, a 22-year-old In­done­sian man, is a crew mem­ber of a ship which ar­rived from Indonesia. He had not dis­em­barked from the ship un­til he was taken to a quar­an­tine fa­cil­ity, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of one such case in the past week, who is cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>With 17 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,289 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 47 pa­tients re­mained in hospi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 81 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
