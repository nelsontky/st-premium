    <p>Mr Kevin Lee, 49, had beaten can­cer. Or so he thought.</p>
    <p>He was di­ag­nosed with stage 4 na­sopha­ryn­geal can­cer in 2017 and was re­cov­er­ing well.</p>
    <p>But in April last year, as the pan­demic closed in, he found out dur­ing a rou­tine check-up that he had had a re­lapse and re­quired surgery to re­move ma­lig­nant lymph nodes.</p>
    <p>“It was like strik­ing lot­tery twice, but in the wrong way,” re­calls Mr Lee, founder of T.E.A.C.H. En­ter­prises, which of­fers mo­ti­va­tional work­shops and train­ing.</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 raged world­wide, de­mand for his train­ing ser­vices dried up un­der the strain of social distancing.</p>
    <p>His l ow i mmu­nity kept him se­questered in his Sengkang Hous­ing Board flat.</p>
    <p>He soon fell into a “de­pres­sive state” and al­most gave up the fight against can­cer.</p>
    <p>Strug­gling to make a liv­ing, he de­cided to launch a fund-rais­ing drive sell­ing his e-books, which are now his main source of in­come.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, a Catholic, re­cently do­nated about $12,000 of the $30,000 raised to var­i­ous Catholic groups and char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He also used the down­time to fin­ish his eighth book last year.</p>
    <p>Pub­lished in Oc­to­ber, How I Dealt With My Can­cer Re­lapse – A Jour­ney Of Care­giv­ing, Mind­set And Sup­port is an e-book sold for $10 on his web­site, www.teachen­ter­prises.biz/home.</p>
    <p>His books, self-pub­lished through Ama­zon, dis­cuss top­ics such as can­cer, mar­riage and spir­i­tu­al­ity.</p>
    <p>The for­mer teacher is mar­ried to</p>
    <p>Ms Gla­dys Yeong, 43, a pre-school ad­min­is­tra­tor. The cou­ple do not have chil­dren.</p>
    <p>He says his wife re­vealed that dur­ing his first bout of ill­ness in 2017, when he spent six weeks in hos­pi­tal, she used to cry at night at home, hop­ing the phone would not ring with bad news.</p>
    <p>Hear­ing that, he re­solved to keep his chin up.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee says: “When you see your loved one hurt­ing, the last thing you want to do is hurt them or see them suf­fer. I live for my wife.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter his di­ag­no­sis in 2017, he de­cided to pub­lish a book ev­ery year on his birth­day on Oct 10, a prom­ise he has kept.</p>
    <p>Next year, he will be writ­ing a book on care­giv­ing, which will feature his beloved wife, among oth­ers.</p>
