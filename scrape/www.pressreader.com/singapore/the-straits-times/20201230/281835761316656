    <p>•</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore com­pany plans to sue a Myan­mar mil­i­tary con­glom­er­ate over its “op­pres­sive” be­hav­iour, al­leg­ing that it has ig­nored ap­peals for greater trans­parency and ac­count­abil­ity over their joint ven­ture.</p>
    <p>The un­prece­dented ac­tion is ex­pected to in­crease scru­tiny of a mil­i­tary whose vast com­mer­cial deal­ings allow it to op­er­ate with im­punity, say hu­man rights ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>RMH Sin­ga­pore (RMHS) owns 49 per cent of Vir­ginia To­bacco Com­pany Limited (VTCL), the big­gest cig­a­rette maker in Myan­mar, which em­ploys about 1,000 peo­ple. The rest of the com­pany is owned by Myanma Eco­nomic Hold­ings Pub­lic Limited (MEHL), a hold­ing com­pany owned by the mil­i­tary with in­ter­ests in the min­ing, man­u­fac­tur­ing, bank­ing and tourism in­dus­tries, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>MEHL has come un­der pres­sure over its opaque role in fund­ing Myan­mar’s mil­i­tary, which has been ac­cused of geno­cide be­fore the In­ter­na­tional Court of Jus­tice.</p>
    <p>RMHS’ direc­tors are Sin­ga­pore­based Myan­mar busi­ness­man Ge­orge Yin Soon and Sin­ga­porean busi­ness­men Ong Beng Huat and Lim Kal­ing – seed in­vestors in gam­ing pe­riph­er­als firm Razer.</p>
    <p>In a me­dia state­ment last week, RMHS said it was seek­ing relief from the Myan­mar courts to pro­tect its and VTCL’s in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>RMHS said it has been call­ing for changes to the cig­a­rette com­pany’s dis­tri­bu­tion sys­tem to com­ply with lo­cal laws. It also “urged greater trans­parency and ac­count­abil­ity in pay­ments made by VTCL, es­pe­cially monthly do­na­tions re­quested by MEHL”.</p>
    <p>But the re­quests have been ig­nored, said RMHS, adding that it “has also been and con­tin­ues to be subject to un­fair and op­pres­sive treat­ment by MEHL through threats and un­rea­son­able con­duct that is di­rected not only at RMHS but also ad­versely af­fects VTCL, in­clud­ing cut­ting staff wel­fare and with­hold­ing of staff ben­e­fits”.</p>
    <p>In an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view with The Straits Times, Mr Soon said: “We are a Sin­ga­pore-based com­pany. We need to be trans­par­ent. We have other busi­nesses and we don’t want to be linked to these al­le­ga­tions that we are not do­ing the right thing, es­pe­cially on the hu­man rights is­sue.”</p>
    <p>Re­ports by an in­de­pen­dent UN fact-find­ing mis­sion as well as hu­man rights group Amnesty In­ter­na­tional over the past two years have high­lighted how MEHL grows its cor­po­rate dom­i­nance through joint ven­tures with for­eign com­pa­nies like RMHS.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions re­port last year warned that “the rev­enue that these mil­i­tary busi­nesses gen­er­ate strength­ens the Tat­madaw’s au­ton­omy from elected civil­ian over­sight and pro­vides fi­nan­cial sup­port for the Tat­madaw’s op­er­a­tions with their wide ar­ray of in­ter­na­tional hu­man rights and hu­man­i­tar­ian law vi­o­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>Tat­madaw is the lo­cal name for the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Amnesty In­ter­na­tional, in its Septem­ber re­port, said it found that MEHL’s share­hold­ers “in­clude mil­i­tary units be­hind past and con­tin­u­ing crimes un­der in­ter­na­tional law and other se­ri­ous hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions across the coun­try”.</p>
    <p>“MEHL con­trib­utes to these vi­o­la­tions by know­ingly pro­vid­ing funds to these units through the reg­u­lar pay­ment of div­i­dends.”</p>
    <p>After the Amnesty re­port’s pub­li­ca­tion, Ja­panese beer gi­ant Kirin, in­volved in two joint ven­tures with MEHL, said it was sus­pend­ing div­i­dend pay­ments to MEHL pend­ing an in­de­pen­dent probe into the “fi­nan­cial and gov­er­nance struc­tures” of MEHL.</p>
    <p>RMHS al­leged in its state­ment last week that MEHL’s ac­tions have “de­stroyed the sub­stra­tum of the joint ven­ture” which be­gan in 1993.</p>
    <p>Mr Soon told ST: “We be­lieve in the Myan­mar le­gal sys­tem so we are pro­ceed­ing to the Myan­mar court. We want to be treated fairly as an in­vestor.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from ST, MEHL’s gen­eral man­ager Hla Myo said via e-mail that the to­bacco com­pany’s prod­ucts are given monthly to fam­i­lies of sol­diers killed dur­ing bat­tles as part of its cor­po­rate social re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>MEHL, he wrote, did not cut VTCL’s staff bonuses but scru­ti­nised fu­ture ones in light of the pan­demic-in­duced fi­nan­cial dif­fi­culty.</p>
    <p>He added that MEHL fol­lows Myan­mar laws and pays the re­quired taxes.</p>
    <p>“We (pay) no at­ten­tion to for­eign or­gan­i­sa­tions’ pres­sure,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice for Myan­mar, an ac­tivist group which reg­u­larly probes the Tat­madaw’s deal­ings, said that while RMHS’ court ac­tion was “the right move” and may push the MEHL towards greater trans­parency, a lot more needed to be done.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman Yada­nar Maung said: “As an arm of the Myan­mar mil­i­tary, MEHL con­tin­ues to en­joy im­punity and im­mense priv­i­lege as a re­sult of its in­te­gra­tion in the mil­i­tary struc­ture, which is a sys­temic con­flict of in­ter­est.”</p>
    <p>MEHL, she said, “needs to be re­formed by the Myan­mar gov­ern­ment, which must place the com­pany un­der civil­ian own­er­ship”.</p>
    <p>DO­ING THE RIGHT THING</p>
    <p>We are a Sin­ga­pore-based com­pany. We need to be trans­par­ent. We have other busi­nesses and we don’t want to be linked to these al­le­ga­tions that we are not do­ing the right thing, es­pe­cially on the hu­man rights is­sue.</p>
