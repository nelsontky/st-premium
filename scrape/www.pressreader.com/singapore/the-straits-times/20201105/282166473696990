    <p>Re­cent al­le­ga­tions of sus­pects in an Or­chard Tow­ers mur­der case get­ting pref­er­en­tial treat­ment be­cause of their race are “to­tally base­less and highly ir­re­spon­si­ble”, said Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Muham­mad Faishal Ibrahim.</p>
    <p>He pointed out in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day that ev­ery­one in Sin­ga­pore is treated fairly and equally by the law. His re­marks came two days after po­lice said they will in­ves­ti­gate two women, aged 28 and 36, for con­tempt of court.</p>
    <p>They had put up so­cial me­dia posts al­leg­ing pref­er­en­tial treat­ment based on the race of sus­pects in­volved in the death of Mr Satheesh Noel Go­bidass, 31, on July 2 last year.</p>
    <p>He died after be­ing em­broiled in a brawl at Or­chard Tow­ers.</p>
    <p>Seven peo­ple were in­volved in the in­ci­dent, but after investigat­ions, the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) found that six of them were not in­volved in caus­ing the vic­tim’s death, leading to the charges against them be­ing re­duced.</p>
    <p>One of the six, Mr Chan Jia Xing, was given a 12-month con­di­tional warning after his charge was re­duced to con­sort­ing with a per­son car­ry­ing an of­fen­sive weapon in a public place.</p>
    <p>The AGC said the crime Mr Chan was charged with took into ac­count his in­volve­ment, how he tried to stop the at­tack and his co­op­er­a­tion with po­lice investigat­ions.</p>
    <p>The sev­enth per­son, Tan Sen</p>
    <p>Yang, is the only one now fac­ing a mur­der charge.</p>
    <p>Set­ting out the process for han­dling cap­i­tal of­fences such as mur­der and kid­nap­ping, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Faishal told the House that where there are mul­ti­ple sus­pects al­legedly in­volved in the same cap­i­tal case, the same hold­ing charge may be made against all of them ini­tially in court.</p>
    <p>The ac­cused per­sons will be held in re­mand while fur­ther investigat­ions are con­ducted, and law en­force­ment agen­cies will make rec­om­men­da­tions to the AGC.</p>
    <p>Prosecutor­s will then re­view the ev­i­dence and cir­cum­stances of the case, as well as con­sider the spe­cific role of each sus­pect be­fore de­cid­ing on an ap­pro­pri­ate course of ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“(This can be) whether to pro­ceed with the cap­i­tal charge, lesser charge or charges, or to with­draw the charge,” said Prof Faishal in re­sponse to Mr Zhulka­r­nain Ab­dul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC).</p>
    <p>He told the House that the even­tual po­si­tion against each ac­cused per­son may thus dif­fer, as it will be based on the ev­i­dence avail­able and his role in the case.</p>
    <p>He also cited pre­vi­ous ex­am­ples of such a re­duc­tion in charges in­volv­ing mul­ti­ple ac­cused per­sons, in­clud­ing a Downtown East mur­der in 2010 and a Pan­dan Loop mur­der in 2014.</p>
    <p>In the 2010 case, the 12 sus­pects were ini­tially charged with mur­der. Some had armed them­selves to at­tack the vic­tim, 20-year-old stu­dent Dar­ren Ng.</p>
    <p>For those who had known there would be a fight but were un­aware of oth­ers who were armed, the prose­cu­tion amended the charges to ri­ot­ing, after con­sid­er­ing the ev­i­dence and their roles in the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Those who were armed and ac­tively at­tacked the vic­tim were charged with cul­pa­ble homi­cide not amount­ing to mur­der.</p>
    <p>Each group re­ceived sen­tences that were in ac­cor­dance with the sever­ity of their in­volve­ment in the crime.</p>
    <p>No one gets any spe­cial treat­ment in Sin­ga­pore’s law sys­tem, Prof Faishal re­it­er­ated.</p>
    <p>“I as­sure the House that our crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem does not give any pref­er­en­tial treat­ment, based on race, re­li­gion, so­cio-eco­nomic sta­tus or ed­u­ca­tional achieve­ments, and so on,” he added.</p>
