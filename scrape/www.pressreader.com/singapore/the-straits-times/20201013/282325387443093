    <p>ORLANDO • The great­est of all time (GOAT) in bas­ket­ball is a de­bate where peo­ple will not be swayed.</p>
    <p>LeBron James on Sun­day be­came the first player to win four Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) Fi­nals’ Most Valu­able Player (MVP) hon­ours with three dif­fer­ent teams.</p>
    <p>Frank Vo­gel, his Los An­ge­les Lak­ers coach, be­lieves he is “the great­est player the bas­ket­ball uni­verse has ever seen”, while fel­low All-Star team­mate An­thony Davis also called him the GOAT at the cham­pi­onship cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>But there will al­ways be dif­fer­ences of opin­ion – coloured by per­sonal pref­er­ence – when it comes to who sits atop the pedestal, James or Michael Jor­dan.</p>
    <p>With a haul of six NBA cham­pi­onships from six Fi­nals with the Chicago Bulls, many still con­sider “His Air­ness” as the sport’s defin­ing player.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Vo­gel puts “The King” above him.He said: “And if you think you know, you don’t know, okay, un­til you’re around him ev­ery day, you’re coach­ing him, you’re see­ing his mind, you’re see­ing his ad­just­ments, see­ing the way he leads the group.”</p>
    <p>Lak­ers team­mate Kyle Kuzma agreed, in­sist­ing James was a force of na­ture both on the court and off it.</p>
    <p>“He’s one of the great­est lead­ers in sports, not just the NBA,” said the for­ward. “He’s al­ways ral­ly­ing the troops, talk­ing in group chats and making sure every­body’s fine. Holds every­body to a high stan­dard. Makes every­body ac­count­able. Ev­ery­thing you want in a leader.”</p>
    <p>One of Jor­dan’s fiercest ri­vals, Detroit Pis­tons great Isiah Thomas feels the same way.</p>
    <p>As the Lak­ers cel­e­brated by drink­ing his cham­pagne brand Cheurlin 1788 at Dis­ney World, he tweeted: “The best and most ‘com­plete’ player I have seen in my life­time is James on and off the floor. He passed the eye test and the numbers con­firm what my eyes have seen in ev­ery sta­tis­ti­cal cat­e­gory. Let it be known! #GOAT”</p>
    <p>James did not get in­volved in the de­bate, but af­ter his fourth cham­pi­onship in 10 Fi­nals ap­pear­ances, he de­manded the sport­ing world put some re­spect on his name.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old, who recorded his 28th play-off triple-dou­ble – just two be­hind all-time leader Magic John­son – and first of this se­ries on Sun­day, said: “We just want our re­spect. (Lak­ers gen­eral man­ager) Rob (Pelinka) wants his re­spect, coach Vo­gel wants his re­spect, our or­gan­i­sa­tion wants its re­spect, Lak­ers na­tion wants its re­spect. And I want my damn re­spect too.”</p>
