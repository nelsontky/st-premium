    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s tran­si­tion team is pre­par­ing mul­ti­ple sets of pol­icy pro­pos­als for the econ­omy, health­care, cli­mate change and other do­mes­tic is­sues, in­clud­ing the am­bi­tious agenda Mr Bi­den laid out in his win­ning cam­paign, while ac­knowl­edg­ing it may have to be pared back in recog­ni­tion of di­vided gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s aides say his tran­si­tion team is work­ing on a va­ri­ety of con­tin­gency plans de­pend­ing on eco­nomic con­di­tions, in­clud­ing whether the re­cent surge of virus cases chills con­sumer spend­ing, and on party con­trol of the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Where the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion lands de­pends heav­ily on two Se­nate run-offs in Geor­gia in early Jan­uary. If Democrats win both races, close aides to Mr Bi­den and econ­o­mists who helped ad­vise his cam­paign say the Pres­i­dent-elect will try to push through a large stim­u­lus plan for the flag­ging eco­nomic re­cov­ery – most likely along the lines of the US$2.2 tril­lion (S$2.97 tril­lion) that House Democrats ap­proved this fall.</p>
    <p>His stim­u­lus plan un­der such a sce­nario would in­clude hun­dreds of bil­lions of dol­lars for state and lo­cal gov­ern­ments that have lost tax rev­enue amid the pan­demic re­ces­sion, as well as ex­tend unem­ploy­ment ben­e­fits for peo­ple who lost jobs dur­ing the cri­sis and pro­vide a new round of aid for small busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>His team is also de­vel­op­ing a gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ment pro­gramme – called the Public Health Jobs Corps – that would put 100,000 Amer­i­cans to work on virus test­ing and con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>A nar­row ma­jor­ity in the Se­nate would also give Mr Bi­den the chance to push through his pro­posed tax in­creases on cor­po­ra­tions and the rich – tax hikes that would be used to fund the Pres­i­dent-elect’s more am­bi­tious plans like re­build­ing roads and bridges, speed­ing the tran­si­tion to a car­bon­free en­ergy sec­tor and help­ing Amer­i­cans af­ford health­care.</p>
    <p>But if Re­pub­li­cans win even one of the Geor­gia seats, Mr Bi­den will most likely need to set­tle for a wave of ex­ec­u­tive ac­tions that would bring more in­cre­men­tal progress to­wards his pol­icy goals, while try­ing to cut com­pro­mise deals with Se­na­tor Mitch Mc­Connell of Ken­tucky, the ma­jor­ity leader.</p>
    <p>Tax in­creases, even for the ul­tra­rich, would al­most cer­tainly be off the ta­ble, as would be ex­pand­ing the Af­ford­able Care Act to give Amer­i­cans the abil­ity to buy into a gov­ern­ment in­surance pro­gramme like Medi­care. Mr Bi­den would con­tinue to push for in­fra­struc­ture and health­care Bills, econ­o­mists around him say, but he would be un­likely to win sup­port for his full agenda in those ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The team is also mov­ing ahead with fi­nal­ists for ap­point­ments to key Cabi­net po­si­tions and other posts, many of which will be an­nounced be­fore the Geor­gia run-off.</p>
    <p>Se­na­tor Dan Sul­li­van, an Alaska Repub­li­can, won re-elec­tion on Wed­nes­day af­ter a tougher-thanex­pected race against an in­de­pen­dent can­di­date threat­ened to cost him a sec­ond term and im­peril his party’s chance of hold­ing its ma­jor­ity. Mr Trump on Wed­nes­day also won the state and its three elec­toral votes. Mr Sul­li­van’s vic­tory, which came on the heels of the ap­par­ent win of Se­na­tor Thom Til­lis in North Carolina, put Re­pub­li­cans a step closer to keep­ing con­trol of the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Bi­den on Wed­nes­day an­nounced he has cho­sen Mr Ron Klain, a sea­soned Demo­cratic op­er­a­tive, as his chief of staff, his first public per­son­nel choice for the White House. “Ron has been in­valu­able to me over the many years that we have worked to­gether,” Mr Bi­den said in a state­ment on Mr Klain, who also served as the Demo­crat’s first chief of staff when he be­came vice-pres­i­dent in 2009.</p>
    <p>“His deep, var­ied ex­pe­ri­ence and ca­pac­ity to work with peo­ple all across the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum is pre­cisely what I need in a White House chief of staff as we con­front this mo­ment of cri­sis and bring our coun­try to­gether again,” Mr Bi­den said.</p>
    <p>Mr Klain, 59, also worked with Mr Bi­den when he was chair­man of the Se­nate Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Af­ter­wards, he served as chief of staff to vice-pres­i­dent Al Gore. Un­der pres­i­dent Barack Obama, Mr Klain co­or­di­nated the White House re­sponse to the Ebola cri­sis in 2014.</p>
    <p>In the same state­ment re­leased by the Bi­den tran­si­tion team, Mr Klain said it was “the hon­our of a life­time” to be named Mr Bi­den’s chief of staff. “I look for­ward to help­ing him and the Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect as­sem­ble a tal­ented and di­verse team to work in the White House, as we tackle their am­bi­tious agenda for change, and seek to heal the di­vides in our coun­try,” Mr Klain said.</p>
