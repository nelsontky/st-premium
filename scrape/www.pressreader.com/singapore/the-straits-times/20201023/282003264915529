    <p>If there is one thing Mr Muham­mad Suhairi Subarjo has learnt from his years of coun­selling and guid­ing stu­dents with be­havioural is­sues, it is how to be a good lis­tener.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple tell these stu­dents they can’t do this and that. Some­times it’s about lis­ten­ing to the stu­dents them­selves, who are of­ten mis­un­der­stood,” said the se­nior al­lied ed­u­ca­tor (AED), who spe­cialises in learn­ing and be­havioural sup­port (LBS).</p>
    <p>At times, the stu­dents react on im­pulse, which can re­sult in neg­a­tive be­hav­iour and mis­un­der­stand­ings, he said.</p>
    <p>“They talk first be­fore they think, and some­times they can’t con­trol this,” said Mr Suhairi, 40.</p>
    <p>He still re­mem­bers one of his first stu­dents at Tampines Sec­ondary School, who had autism and at­ten­tion deficit hy­per­ac­tiv­ity dis­or­der.</p>
    <p>“I built a rap­port with him, but he didn’t have a good re­la­tion­ship with an­other teacher. He felt the teacher was pick­ing on him, while the teacher thought he was not lis­ten­ing to her.”</p>
    <p>In the end, Mr Suhairi stepped in to lis­ten to both sides and helped to re­store their re­la­tion­ship over time.</p>
    <p>“It takes time to mod­ify be­hav­iour, and that’s one chal­lenge we face with par­ents and teach­ers who ex­pect the prob­lem to be quickly over­come with just two or three in­ter­ven­tion ses­sions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Now, as a se­nior AED (LBS), Mr Suhairi spends more time work­ing with school lead­ers and AEDs on more dif­fi­cult cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Suhairi and Ms Maria Lour</p>
    <p>des will be the first two staff to be ap­pointed as lead AEDs (LBS) from next Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>They will most likely be more in­volved in the plan­ning and con­duct­ing of pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Ms Lourdes, 40, who is now a se­nior AED (LBS), said there has been more de­mand for sup­port for stu­dents over the years, as par­ents now de­tect learn­ing or be­havioural is­sues in their chil­dren at a younger age.</p>
    <p>“On av­er­age, I used to han­dle 60 stu­dents in a year, and this grew to 70,” she said, adding that build­ing rap­port with par­ents is a key part of the AED’s job.</p>
    <p>“We get par­ents who take some time, as long as two to three years, to ac­cept that their child has some form of spe­cial need,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We try to un­der­stand where they’re com­ing from, and get them to see that with the right in­ter­ven­tion, their child can ex­cel aca­dem­i­cally or so­cially.”</p>
    <p>She added: “Par­ents some­times can­not see the long-term goals be­cause they only see the cur­rent is­sues, so we have to be very pa­tient.”</p>
