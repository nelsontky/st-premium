    <p>Aus­tralians have been heed­ing ad­vice to work from home dur­ing the pan­demic, but the move is tak­ing a heavy toll on the down­town prop­erty mar­ket and on the shops and cafes that give char­ac­ter to the cen­tral busi­ness district (CBD).</p>
    <p>In Syd­ney, the coun­try’s big­gest city, many of­fice work­ers are now work­ing from home, in line with the rec­om­men­da­tions by the state govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne, the coun­try’s sec­ond-big­gest city, is even qui­eter as it en­dures a strict lock­down – in­clud­ing an 8pm to 5am cur­few – fol­low­ing a re­cent surge of new cases.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne’s Mayor Sally Capp re­vealed last week that cur­rent foot traf­fic in the CBD was down about 90 per cent com­pared with the same pe­riod last year. “The city hasn’t been this empty for this long in liv­ing mem­ory,” she said.</p>
    <p>Adding to the sud­den quiet in Aus­tralia’s ma­jor city cen­tres, curbs on in­ter­na­tional travel have led to a sharp drop in the num­ber of in­ter­na­tional stu­dents and for­eign work­ers. Many of these tem­po­rary vis­i­tors tended to stay in and around the CBD.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty re­search firm SQM Re­search said last week that va­can­cies in Syd­ney’s CBD had al­most dou­bled since last year. As of July, 13 per cent were va­cant, com­pared with 7 per cent in July last year. In Mel­bourne, the va­cancy rate was about 9 per cent, up from 3 per cent in July last year.</p>
    <p>Rental va­can­cies across the coun­try are now “ex­traor­di­nar­ily high”, said SQM Re­search founder Louis Christo­pher, who ex­pects this to be the case un­til bor­ders open.</p>
    <p>As of Satur­day, Aus­tralia had recorded 23,036 cases of Covid-19 and 380 deaths. The state of Vic­to­ria is now in the grip of a se­ri­ous out­break. Of the 313 new cases recorded on Satur­day, 303 were in Vic­to­ria, nine were in New South Wales and one was in West­ern Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has caused se­ri­ous eco­nomic dam­age, with the un­em­ploy­ment rate at 7.5 per cent last week, the high­est level in 22 years. Aus­tralia’s cen­tral bank, the Re­serve Bank, ex­pects un­em­ploy­ment to reach 10 per cent by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>In both Syd­ney and Mel­bourne, the drain of res­i­dents and of­fice work­ers has proven dev­as­tat­ing for the cafes, restau­rants, clothes stores and other re­tail out­lets that add life and char­ac­ter to the sky­scraper-filled down­town dis­tricts.</p>
    <p>In Syd­ney, just 17 per cent of busi­nesses in the city cen­tre are run­ning as nor­mal, with 62 per cent op­er­at­ing in a limited or changed ca­pac­ity, 20 per cent tem­po­rar­ily closed and 1 per cent shut per­ma­nently, ac­cord­ing to re­search by the City of Syd­ney. Of those stores still open, 80 per cent have cut back on staff hours and 40 per cent have cut staff num­bers.</p>
    <p>A bar­ber in the city cen­tre, Mr Fedl Babka, said he worked op­po­site an of­fice build­ing that used to be oc­cu­pied by 2,000 work­ers each day, but that is down to just 100 now. He es­ti­mated his busi­ness could sur­vive only an­other three to four months un­less cus­tomers re­turn to the city. “If we have a sec­ond wave, it will be a big hit for busi­nesses. We will dis­ap­pear for sure,” he told ABC News.</p>
    <p>The city of Syd­ney has pro­vided grants to strug­gling small busi­nesses. Busi­ness groups have also called for coun­cils and busi­nesses to find ways to adapt to the cur­rent re­stric­tions. The Com­mit­tee for Syd­ney, an in­de­pen­dent think­tank, said last week that coun­cils should con­sider clos­ing streets to traf­fic to al­low ex­tra out­door space for din­ing and per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>“We want to see coun­cils mak­ing it as easy as pos­si­ble for busi­nesses to op­er­ate out­side and clos­ing some streets to traf­fic to al­low more space for peo­ple to con­gre­gate (out­doors),” the com­mit­tee’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, Mr Gabriel Met­calf, told The Syd­ney Morn­ing Herald. “We also want to see manda­tory face masks worn in a lot of in­door spa­ces, which will help to stop the spread of the virus and give peo­ple con­fi­dence that it is safe to go out.”</p>
