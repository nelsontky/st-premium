    <p>•</p>
    <p>It took Edouard Mendy five years to go from be­ing un­em­ployed to the Cham­pi­ons League and it has taken him j ust five games to seem­ingly solve Chelsea’s goal­keep­ing prob­lem.</p>
    <p>All eyes were on the giant Sene­gal stop­per when the Pre­mier League club paid £22 mil­lion (S$39 mil­lion) to sign him from French Ligue 1 out­fit Rennes in Septem­ber i n re­sponse to the chronic strug­gles of Kepa Ar­riz­a­bal­aga.</p>
    <p>Less than two months later, Mendy – stand­ing at al­most 2m – has ap­peared to have made the No. 1 po­si­tion his own as Chelsea host his for­mer team in Group E of the Cham­pi­ons League to­day.</p>
    <p>Blues man­ager Frank Lam­pard sang the praises of the 28-yearold, who has kept five suc­ces­sive clean sheets in all com­pe­ti­tions, dur­ing his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways a col­lec­tive ef­fort, but he has made a very good start. He has to take credit for that, giv­ing con­fi­dence to oth­ers as well,” he said.</p>
    <p>“When we were in to sign him, all the feed­back was that he had a strong per­son­al­ity in the dress­ing. He is very low main­te­nance. He wants to en­gage and he works hard. He is a pos­i­tive in the dress­ing room.</p>
    <p>“He has shown big parts of his game. Big saves in big mo­ments, like in Manch­ester United against (Mar­cus) Rash­ford. He has given off a sense of calm with crosses. It is early days for him at the club.</p>
    <p>“I am very con­fi­dent in him. There will be a lot more come, but in his at­ti­tude, I have seen he def­i­nitely can go much fur­ther in many de­part­ments.</p>
    <p>“What I have seen is that he has a mas­sive work ethic to push him­self. He has shown that and smiled ev­ery day. He has asked rel­e­vant ques­tions and en­gaged with the players around him. I have just sensed that with him. He seems pretty laid back.”</p>
    <p>Timo Wer­ner, another of the Blues’ sum­mer ar­rivals, also spoke glow­ingly of Mendy and how fast he has adapted to life in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>“Edou is a re­ally nice guy. He is re­ally calm and you can talk to him and we have a lot of French-speak­ing players who can help him,” said the Ger­many striker.</p>
    <p>“There are a lot of young guys who are very nice and calm, and can set­tle in.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea and Europa League win­ners Sevilla are ex­pected to fight it out for first and sec­ond in Group E</p>
    <p>– the open­ing two games have in­di­cated as much – but Lam­pard does not want his players to take their foot off the gas against Rennes, who are mak­ing their de­but at this level.</p>
    <p>“Where we are in the group we are happy, but we can’t get com­pla­cent,” he said. “We must stay on top of our­selves. The clean sheets have been great. We al­ways want to im­prove. We have seen some pro­gres­sion but it is a work in progress. We can’t come off.”</p>
    <p>Chris­tian Pulisic will be ab­sent for the Stam­ford Bridge en­counter with a “very mi­nor in­jury”, ac­cord­ing to Lam­pard, who can oth­er­wise draw on a fully fit squad.</p>
    <p>Sing­tel Ch110 & StarHub Ch214, to­mor­row, 3.55am</p>
    <p>Chelsea goal­keeper Edouard Mendy is set to come up against his for­mer club Rennes in the Cham­pi­ons League to­day.</p>
