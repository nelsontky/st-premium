    <p>Alibaba Group Hold­ing’s rev­enue grew at its slow­est pace on record for a Septem­ber quar­ter, un­der­scor­ing how the ecom­merce gi­ant’s post-pan­demic re­bound is start­ing to plateau.</p>
    <p>Asia’s largest cor­po­ra­tion re­ported a 30 per cent rise in sales in the Septem­ber quar­ter, in line with ex­pec­ta­tions but down a tad from the pre­vi­ous three months.</p>
    <p>That did lit­tle to re­as­sure in­vestors wor­ried about the tight­en­ing reg­u­la­tory scru­tiny that forced Mr Jack Ma’s Ant Group to call off its US$37 bil­lion (S$49.85 bil­lion) ini­tial public of­fer­ing (IPO).</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive Daniel Zhang would only say Alibaba is eval­u­at­ing the im­pact on its busi­ness from more strin­gent rules gov­ern­ing its 32 per cent-owned sis­ter com­pany.</p>
    <p>Alibaba’s shares sank as much as 4.3 per cent in early Hong Kong trad­ing yes­ter­day, ex­tend­ing a volatile streak that be­gan with a sell-off of more than US$60 bil­lion ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>The com­pany en­joys a close re­la­tion­ship with Ant, whose Ali­pay mo­bile wal­let an­chors the ma­jor­ity of Alibaba’s e-com­merce trans­ac­tions and whose mi­crolend­ing ser­vices drive con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a ques­tion about the ex­tent to which Ant loans lead to on­line shop­ping, ex­ec­u­tives said the com­pany does not quan­tify that traf­fic.</p>
    <p>“As Ant Group’s ma­jor share­holder, Alibaba is ac­tively eval­u­at­ing the im­pact on our busi­ness in re­sponse to the re­cently pro­posed changes in the fin­tech reg­u­la­tory en­vi­ron­ment, and will take ap­pro­pri­ate mea­sures ac­cord­ingly,” Mr Zhang told an­a­lysts on a con­fer­ence call.</p>
    <p>Alibaba booked al­most 4.7 bil­lion yuan (S$957.3 mil­lion) of profit from Ant in the Septem­ber quar­ter, a big chunk of its over­all bot­tom line.</p>
    <p>The e-com­merce gi­ant re­ported rev­enue for the three months ended Septem­ber of 155.1 bil­lion yuan, meet­ing the 154.8 bil­lion yuan av­er­age of es­ti­mates. Profit fell 60 per cent to 28.8 bil­lion yuan from a year ear­lier, when it booked a one-time gain from the ac­qui­si­tion of its stake in Ant.</p>
    <p>Alibaba had ben­e­fited from stronger sales in its home mar­ket, which had led the global re­cov­ery from Covid-19. Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct grew 4.9 per cent last quar­ter, mak­ing China the world’s only ma­jor growth en­gine.</p>
    <p>The e-com­merce ti­tan is bank­ing on more than a quar­ter of a mil­lion brands, in­creased discountin­g and tech­nolo­gies like livestream­ed sell­ing to draw con­sumers to its an­nual block­buster Sin­gles’ Day shop­ping fes­ti­val, which cul­mi­nates next week.</p>
    <p>“The per­for­mance of Sin­gles’ Day might be a more im­por­tant bench­mark to look at, rather than the third-quar­ter re­sult,” said Mr Steven Zhu, a Pa­cific Epoch an­a­lyst. “E-com­merce is the only sec­tor that will ac­tu­ally ben­e­fit from coro­n­avirus, sim­ply due to the fact that a lot of nor­mal con­sump­tion is shifted from off­line to on­line.”</p>
    <p>Alibaba’s shares have gained more than 60 per cent from their Covid-era lows in March and touched a record high last month when Ant priced its IPO. Re­tail and in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors had flocked to the record US$35 bil­lion-plus IPO, bet­ting that Ant would over­come high val­u­a­tions, reg­u­la­tory head­winds and ris­ing com­pe­ti­tion to re­shape the fu­ture of global fi­nance.</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing the Covid-hit March quar­ter, the 29 per cent in­crease in Alibaba’s core com­merce busi­ness was the slow­est in more than five years as con­sumers put off pur­chases ahead of Sin­gles’ Day. The closely watched cus­tomer man­age­ment rev­enue for China com­merce rose 20 per cent in the quar­ter. Core com­merce should ex­pand at a com­pound an­nual growth rate of 23 per cent from next year to 2023, CGS-CIMB an­a­lysts wrote.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue for Alibaba’s cloud di­vi­sion jumped 60 per cent in the quar­ter, driven by de­mand from cus­tomers in the In­ter­net, fi­nance and re­tail in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>The unit is fore­cast to turn prof­itable for the first time in the year end­ing next March, a tar­get that was re­it­er­ated by chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer Mag­gie Wu on Thurs­day. It will be a mile­stone for the decade­old busi­ness, which com­petes with the likes of Ama­zon Web Ser­vices, Mi­crosoft and Google glob­ally and is fend­ing off up­starts like Ten­cent Hold­ings at home.</p>
