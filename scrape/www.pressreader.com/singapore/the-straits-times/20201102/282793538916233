    <p>TAIPEI Tai­wanese direc­tor Chang Yi (right), who was in Sin­ga­pore last year for the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Film Fes­ti­val, died yes­ter­day at the age of 69.</p>
    <p>Li­uli Gong­fang, the glass stu­dio de­voted to artis­tic Chi­nese glass­ware founded in 1987 by Chang and his wife, ac­tress Loretta Yang, 68, an­nounced his pass­ing on so­cial me­dia yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It said that Chang died peace­fully yes­ter­day morn­ing in the com­pany of Yang, daugh­ter Chang Yuan and other fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The Tai­wanese me­dia re­ported last Wed­nes­day that Yi Chang was in crit­i­cal con­di­tion due to in­fec­tions af­ter a heart op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the me­dia, he had un­der­gone heart stent surgery in the past and had to go for fre­quent blood trans­fu­sions due to a high white blood cell count.</p>
    <p>Yang ac­knowl­edged Chang’s con­di­tion last Thurs­day when Li­uli Gong­fang posted on Face­book a let­ter writ­ten by her, as she dis­closed that Chang was un­well in the last two years and had been in and out of hos­pi­tal since Fe­bru­ary this year.</p>
    <p>She said he had been suf­fer­ing from sev­eral health is­sues, such as those re­lated to his im­mune sys­tem and kid­neys.</p>
    <p>Chang is fa­mous for di­rect­ing movies such as Jade Love (1984), based on the 1960 novella of the same name by Pai Hsien-yung, This Love Of Mine (1986); and Kuei-mei, A Woman (1985), with the lat­ter win­ning four awards at the Golden Horse Awards, in­clud­ing Best Pic­ture and Best Direc­tor for Chang.</p>
    <p>Yang, who starred in the film, won Best Ac­tress at the awards.</p>
    <p>Chang is also one of four direc­tors of the Tai­wanese film, In Our Time (1982). The other three direc­tors are Ed­ward Yang, Ko I-chen and Tao Te-chen.</p>
    <p>Chang and Loretta Yang fell in love af­ter col­lab­o­rat­ing on sev­eral movies. They left the movie in­dus­try af­ter Chang’s then wife, fa­mous writer Hsiao Sa, wrote a let­ter in the news­pa­per in 1986 ex­pos­ing their af­fair.</p>
