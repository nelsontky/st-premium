    <p>Aus­tralia’s two re­main­ing jour­nal­ists in China took shel­ter in diplo­matic mis­sions be­fore hur­riedly fly­ing out of the coun­try as ten­sions be­tween the two na­tions fur­ther de­te­ri­o­rated.</p>
    <p>In a devel­op­ment that For­eign Min­is­ter Marise Payne la­belled “very dis­ap­point­ing”, the Aus­tralian Broad­cast­ing Cor­po­ra­tion (ABC) and the Aus­tralian Fi­nan­cial Re­view re­moved their re­spec­tive China cor­re­spon­dents, Bill Bir­tles and Mike Smith, over con­cerns for their safety, leav­ing Aus­tralia with­out a China cor­re­spon­dent for the first time since the 1970s.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment be­came con­cerned about the pair early last week and urged their me­dia out­lets to leave China. Then, at about 12.30am last Thurs­day, Chi­nese se­cu­rity of­fi­cers vis­ited the jour­nal­ists’ homes and told them they were banned from leav­ing the coun­try and were to be ques­tioned over a na­tional se­cu­rity case.</p>
    <p>Mr Bir­tles, who is based in Beijing, took refuge in the Aus­tralian em­bassy, while Mr Smith, based in Shang­hai, sought pro­tec­tion in the Aus­tralian con­sulate there. Both flew back to Aus­tralia on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s very dis­ap­point­ing to have to l eave un­der those cir­cum­stances,” Mr Bir­tles said af­ter ar­riv­ing in Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>“It’s a re­lief to be back in a coun­try with gen­uine rule of law. But this was a whirl­wind and it’s not a par­tic­u­larly good ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>The de­par­ture of the re­porters fol­lows the de­ten­tion last month of Chi­nese-born Aus­tralian jour­nal­ist Cheng Lei, a pre­sen­ter for China Global Tele­vi­sion Net­work, on “na­tional se­cu­rity grounds”.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing ques­tion­ing by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties be­fore they left, Mr Bir­tles said he knew Ms Cheng but not well. Mr Smith said he had never spo­ken to her.</p>
    <p>A for­eign min­istry spokesman, Mr Zhao Li­jian, said China wel­comes for­eign jour­nal­ists and that those who obey the law have “no need… to worry”.</p>
    <p>Asked if only Aus­tralian jour­nal­ists were tar­geted, he said: “China’s po­si­tion has been stated very clearly, and there is no such sit­u­a­tion as you men­tioned.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bir­tles said he was sad that he had be­come “a pawn in a much big­ger diplo­matic stoush”.</p>
    <p>“My de­par­ture is just part of a big­ger trend ac­cel­er­ated by Beijing’s in­creas­ing pur­suit of a nar­ra­tive ex­clu­sively on the Com­mu­nist Party’s terms,” he wrote on the ABC News web­site.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent marks a fur­ther de­cline in ties be­tween Aus­tralia and its largest trad­ing part­ner in re­cent years. Beijing has ex­pressed anger at Can­berra’s for­eign in­ter­fer­ence and its re­cent call for an in­quiry into the ori­gins of Covid-19, both of which seemed to be aimed at China. In moves seen as re­tal­ia­tory, China has im­posed tar­iffs and ex­port bans on Aus­tralian goods such as barley and some beef prod­ucts, although Beijing in­sisted the steps were not po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>The For­eign Cor­re­spon­dents’ Club of China con­demned Beijing’s “un­prece­dented ha­rass­ment and in­tim­i­da­tion” of the two Aus­tralian jour­nal­ists. It said 17 for­eign jour­nal­ists had been ex­pelled from the coun­try in the first half of this year.</p>
    <p>The US yes­ter­day also slammed China for “threat­en­ing” and “ha­rass­ing” for­eign jour­nal­ists af­ter it re­fused to re­new the press cre­den­tials of at least five jour­nal­ists from four Amer­i­can me­dia groups, in­clud­ing the Wall Street Jour­nal, CNN and Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>In what is seen as counter claims, China’s Global Times re­ported yes­ter­day that the Aus­tralian in­tel­li­gence agency re­cently raided the homes of Chi­nese jour­nal­ists in Aus­tralia, seized their com­put­ers and smart­phones, and ques­tioned them. Cit­ing un­named sources, it claimed the jour­nal­ists were warned not to re­port the in­ci­dent.</p>
