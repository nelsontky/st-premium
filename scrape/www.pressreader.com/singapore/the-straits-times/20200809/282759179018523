    <p>Hawk­ers be nim­ble</p>
    <p>If, in Jan­uary, you had told a hawker in Be­dok that he would, in May, be de­liv­er­ing his noo­dles to an Ang Mo Kio res­i­dent, he would have laughed you right out of the hawker cen­tre.</p>
    <p>And yet, in the mas­sive, whiplash-in­duc­ing Ex­er­cise Pivot that hap­pened dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, hawk­ers turned out to be among the most nim­ble.</p>
    <p>There are Face­book pages ded­i­cated to hawker food that can be de­liv­ered. They now go on In­sta­gram to hawk their wares. Tech-savvy kids have been pressed into ser­vice, to fig­ure out ways to get mum and dad’s food out to peo­ple. Food pack­ag­ing up­dated. Combo sets and ir­re­sistible deals ga­lore. Hand­made noo­dles and dumplings frozen in boxes so peo­ple can buy and cook at home.</p>
    <p>One Aaron Lim put out a siren call on Hawk­ers United, a Face­book page. He wrote a poem about his lao pei (fa­ther), Ah Guan, whose stall in Tampines is called My Fa­ther’s Minced Meat Noo­dle.</p>
    <p>“Times are bad, but it could be worse/His noo­dle might not be the first/But the wan­tons will def­i­nitely give you an out­burst,” goes one verse.</p>
    <p>He even squeezed vi­tal in­for­ma­tion into the poem – GrabFood and De­liv­eroo will de­liver his fa­ther’s noo­dles to you – soup or dry. “Try both lah,” he in­structs.</p>
    <p>We take hawker food for granted. We also put up with strange open­ing hours, gruff ser­vice, ar­cane rules of en­gage­ment – all the quirks that give this part of the food scene so much char­ac­ter and so much grist for our mill.</p>
    <p>When painted into a cor­ner, these trea­sures of Sin­ga­pore stepped up. There was no other choice – get with the pro­gramme or per­ish. They de­cided to fight. They dragged them­selves into the 21st cen­tury.</p>
    <p>But no mat­ter what, no­tice how it is al­ways “minced meat noo­dle”, never “noo­dles”?</p>
