    <p>The girls have come out in force for the inau­gu­ral EFG Sin­ga­pore Ju­nior Masters, with 30 en­tered in the Nov 30-Dec 2 tour­na­ment at the La­guna Na­tional Golf and Coun­try Club.</p>
    <p>While they ac­counted for less than half of the 76-strong field, local ju­nior tour­na­ments usu­ally see boys out­num­ber­ing girls by two to one, noted the Sin­ga­pore Ladies Golf As­so­ci­a­tion (SLGA).</p>
    <p>Na­tional women’s golfer Shan­non Tan will com­pete in the open di­vi­sion for those aged 19 and un­der and the 16-year-old is looking for­ward to her first tour­na­ment in al­most a year since the coro­n­avirus pandemic threw the in­ter­na­tional sports cal­en­dar into dis­ar­ray.</p>
    <p>She said: “My last tour­na­ment was the SEA Games last De­cem­ber, so I’m ex­cited and grate­ful for this op­por­tu­nity to com­pete.</p>
    <p>“The fo­cus level and goals are dif­fer­ent in com­pet­i­tive golf com­pared to a prac­tice round.</p>
    <p>“Com­pet­ing reg­u­larly helps me raise my game, and this tour­na­ment will al­low me to get back to the right en­vi­ron­ment to build up to­wards next year’s SEA Games.”</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by LLD Sports Devel­op­ment and Man­age­ment, the 54-hole event com­prises the open and ju­nior (14 years and un­der) di­vi­sions and pro­vides ju­nior golfers a plat­form to test them­selves and gain ac­cess to ma­jor ju­nior and ama­teur tour­na­ments such as the China Ama­teur Open and Sin­ga­pore Ladies Masters 2021.</p>
    <p>World Ama­teur Golf Rank­ing points are also up for grabs for the par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>The tour­na­ment at La­guna’s Masters Course is the first golf event to be held in Sin­ga­pore since mea­sures were put in place to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>LLD man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, who is also SLGA pres­i­dent, Lyn Yeo, had helped to se­cure ti­tle spon­sors</p>
    <p>EFG Bank and other part­ners.</p>
    <p>She said: “Ju­nior play­ers in our neigh­bour­ing coun­tries have all re­sumed tour­na­ments and their play­ers were all forg­ing ahead.</p>
    <p>“I was de­ter­mined to get an event off the ground for our Sin­ga­pore-based play­ers as our top play­ers are starved of com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>The field will fea­ture Sin­ga­pore­based play­ers in­clud­ing those from Malaysia, China, In­dia, United States, United King­dom, Ger­many, South Korea and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Also in the field are Zoie Chan, Chloe Chan and Ari­anna Lau, who will fly in from Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>As the trio are trav­el­ling within the Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong air travel bub­ble, they do not need to serve any quar­an­tine and re­quire only a neg­a­tive swab test within 72 hours of de­par­ture from Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Other safe man­age­ment mea­sures, in ac­cor­dance with guide­lines from Sport Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore Golf As­so­ci­a­tion, in­clude a sin­gle bar­rel one-tee start, no min­gling of groups, no spec­ta­tors, no ex­change of score­cards, and no re­moval of flag­sticks.</p>
    <p>Play­ers will also be en­cour­aged to play and leave and not use the chang­ing fa­cil­i­ties at the club.</p>
