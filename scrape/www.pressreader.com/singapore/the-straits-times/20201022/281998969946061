    <p>The Work­ers’ Party (WP) has filed a fresh mo­tion in Par­lia­ment to talk about is­sues raised by a court case in­volv­ing Ms Parti Liyani, the for­mer do­mes­tic worker of for­mer Changi Air­port Group and Sur­bana Jurong chair­man Liew Mun Leong.</p>
    <p>The pri­vate mem­ber’s mo­tion, which al­lows an MP to speak on a topic of his choice, was filed by WP chair­man Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) and sup­ported by her fel­low WP MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC), said the party in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Last month, Ms Lim had wanted to speak in Par­lia­ment on the case and had filed an ad­journ­ment mo­tion, which al­lows an MP to speak for 20 min­utes at the end of a sit­ting, fol­lowed by a 10-minute re­ply.</p>
    <p>But such a mo­tion is sub­jected to bal­lot­ing and her mo­tion was not picked for the Oct 5 Par­lia­ment sit­ting.</p>
    <p>With the pri­vate mem­ber’s mo­tion, there would be no bal­lot­ing and all MPs can join the en­su­ing de­bate.</p>
    <p>The mo­tion states: “That this House af­firms that fair­ness, ac­cess and in­de­pen­dence are cor­ner­stones of Sin­ga­pore’s jus­tice sys­tem, and calls on the Gov­ern­ment to recog­nise and rem­edy its short­com­ings in or­der to en­hance jus­tice for all, re­gard­less of means or so­cial sta­tus, in­clud­ing fa­cil­i­tat­ing a re­view of the jus­tice sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>Ms Parti was sen­tenced to jail for two years and two months last year for steal­ing $34,000 worth of items from the Liew fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian do­mes­tic worker had her con­vic­tion over­turned by High Court Judge Chan Seng Onn, who ques­tioned the mo­ti­va­tion of the Liew fam­ily in mak­ing the po­lice re­port. He also raised is­sues with the po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Separately, Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam looks set to de­liver a min­is­te­rial state­ment on the case in Par­lia­ment next month.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan had told Par­lia­ment on Oct 5 that Mr Shan­mugam’s state­ment is ex­pected to be de­liv­ered af­ter the po­lice and the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers com­plete their re­view of the High Court judg­ment.</p>
