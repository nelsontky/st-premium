    <p>The race to suc­ceed out­go­ing Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe is in­ten­si­fy­ing, with a flurry of bro­ker­ing and ma­noeu­vring in late-night meet­ings among fac­tions in the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP).</p>
    <p>At least five former Cabi­net min­is­ters have said they will vie for the top job, while three in­cum­bent min­is­ters said they will dis­cuss the way for­ward with their col­leagues.</p>
    <p>But pun­dits say Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga, 71, trusty lieu­tenant to Mr Abe, is eas­ily the front run­ner if he opts to run.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga pre­vi­ously said he was not in­ter­ested, but has high pub­lic recog­ni­tion as Mr Abe’s top govern­ment spokesman since Mr Abe took power in De­cem­ber 2012.</p>
    <p>Still, de­tails of the in­ter­nal party poll to choose the next LDP pres­i­dent – in­clud­ing the when and the how – re­main un­de­cided and will only be fixed at the party’s gen­eral coun­cil meet­ing on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia yes­ter­day floated Sept 15 as a pos­si­ble date for the vote to de­cide Mr Abe’s suc­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>As the LDP forms the govern­ment, the party leader also tra­di­tion­ally be­comes prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The LDP usu­ally an­nounces an elec­tion for its pres­i­dent a month in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>In this sce­nario, law­mak­ers in the Diet and rank-and-file grass­roots mem­bers across the na­tion will cast their vote but it will take time, as bal­lots will have to be mailed across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s abrupt res­ig­na­tion on Friday due to a flare-up of a chronic con­di­tion comes a year be­fore his term was due to ex­pire in Septem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>This trig­gers the pos­si­bil­ity of a stream­lined extraordin­ary elec­tion, where MPs and rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the party’s lo­cal chap­ters can vote.</p>
    <p>The LDP now has 394 law­mak­ers in the Diet, and as each of the 47 pre­fec­tural chap­ters is al­lot­ted three votes, it means Mr Abe’s suc­ces­sor will be de­cided by 535 party vot­ers.</p>
    <p>While the LDP pres­i­dent car­ries a three-year ten­ure, the win­ner this time will carry out the re­main­der of Mr Abe’s term, with a poll still to be set for Septem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe has said he will stay on as PM un­til his suc­ces­sor is cho­sen. The Cabi­net will con­tinue to be in charge, but will not be able to adopt new poli­cies.</p>
    <p>The vic­tor will in­herit a coun­try</p>
    <p>POS­SI­BLE CON­TENDERS</p>
    <p>MR YOSHI­HIDE SUGA, 71 Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary that is more con­fi­dent on the global stage, but be­set by do­mes­tic prob­lems, in­clud­ing mount­ing debt, an econ­omy bat­tered by the Covid-19 pan­demic and a shrink­ing pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>He or she will have to over­see the Tokyo Olympic Games, which have been post­poned to next July, and pre­pare for a na­tional elec­tion to form the govern­ment, which is due in Oc­to­ber next year.</p>
    <p>There is no heir ap­par­ent, leav­ing the field wide open for what do­mes­tic me­dia term the “post-Abe” era.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe him­self de­clined to name his pref­er­ence, say­ing on Friday: “There have been a lot of promis­ing names, and I ex­pect that the best can­di­date will be cho­sen.”</p>
    <p>For any can­di­date to of­fi­cially enter the fray, they will first have to se­cure 20 nom­i­na­tions among the LDP Diet mem­bers. Mr Suga does not be­long to any fac­tion, but he has plenty of clout within the LDP and the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Five former Cabi­net min­is­ters have an­nounced their am­bi­tions, in­clud­ing former de­fence min­is­ter Shigeru Ishiba, 63.</p>
    <p>He reg­u­larly tops sur­veys as the pub­lic’s pre­ferred PM and has solid sup­port among re­gional LDP mem­bers, but is less pop­u­lar among law­mak­ers due to his fre­quent crit­i­cisms of Mr Abe.</p>
    <p>Former for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida, 63, was once Mr Abe’s pre­ferred suc­ces­sor, but con­cerns have emerged about his lack of charisma and pub­lic pres­ence to fill</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s big shoes.</p>
    <p>Two women min­is­ters – former in­ter­nal af­fairs min­is­ter Seiko Noda, 59, and former de­fence min­is­ter To­momi Inada, 61 – have both said they are keen to run, and would be­come Ja­pan’s first fe­male prime min­is­ter in the un­likely event that ei­ther of them can gather enough party sup­port to pre­vail.</p>
    <p>Former education min­is­ter Hakubun Shi­mo­mura, 66, now the LDP elec­tion strat­egy com­mit­tee chief, is also eye­ing the top job, but is seen as a rank out­sider.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, among the in­cum­bent Cabi­net who are keen are de­fence chief Taro Kono, 57, For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi, 64, and En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Shin­jiro Koizumi, 39.</p>
    <p>Mr Kono, who is pop­u­lar for his can­did re­marks and so­cial me­dia savvy, told re­porters yes­ter­day that he will “think hard about con­test­ing in the elec­tion”.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Mr Motegi said he will dis­cuss the is­sue with his fac­tion col­leagues, while Mr Koizumi said coyly: “The work of the prime min­is­ter is not some­thing that can be done alone. With­out the sup­port of col­leagues, I can­not get to the starting point.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, deputy PM and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Taro Aso, 79, has put him­self out of the run­ning, telling a party fac­tion meet­ing on Friday night that he will not con­test the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>GREAT FRIEND</p>

    <p>MA­JOR ACHIEVE­MENTS @AbeShinzo has achieved great things as PM of Ja­pan – for his coun­try and the world.
