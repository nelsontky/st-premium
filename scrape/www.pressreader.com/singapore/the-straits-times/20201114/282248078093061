    <p>To deal with the sea of on­line in­for­ma­tion, par­ents need to nav­i­gate dig­i­tal con­tent to­gether with their chil­dren in­stead of leav­ing them to their own de­vices.</p>
    <p>This is one way for par­ents to de­velop skills in in­ter­pret­ing con­tent with their chil­dren, which will help boost their crit­i­cal read­ing skills, said read­ing spe­cial­ist Les­lie Davis at an askST@NLB ses­sion yes­ter­day even­ing.</p>
    <p>“Even as adults, we are learn­ing new skills to read be­cause we now have more ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion, and we are hav­ing trou­ble with fact and opin­ion as well,” said Ms Davis, a train­ing con­sul­tant at the Bri­tish Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Ms Davis was speak­ing on the topic “Re­learn­ing to read” in the video talk, which was hosted by The Straits Times se­nior ed­u­ca­tion correspond­ent San­dra Davie, and streamed on ST’s Face­book page.</p>
    <p>They dis­cussed the role par­ents can play in help­ing their chil­dren to be dig­i­tally lit­er­ate.</p>
    <p>The talks, which started i n 2016, are a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween ST and the Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB).</p>
    <p>Why the need to re­learn to read?</p>
    <p>Ms Davie noted that read­ing is a skill that many Sin­ga­porean chil­dren are able to take up with lit­tle dif­fi­culty, but high­lighted the dif­fer­ence be­tween be­ing lit­er­ate and dig­i­tally lit­er­ate.</p>
    <p>“Read­ing has changed and needs to be taught dif­fer­ently,” she said.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of re­ceiv­ing a care­fully cu­rated sin­gle an­swer from a text­book, now stu­dents go on­line and find nu­mer­ous an­swers to ques­tions and it’s up to them to fig­ure out what is right and which an­swer they can trust,” she added. What can par­ents do?</p>
    <p>Ms Davis rec­om­mended a shift to­wards “in­quiry-based learn­ing”, which en­tails ask­ing ques­tions as the first step to­wards learn­ing in­for­ma­tion as op­posed to a fact-first ap­proach.</p>
    <p>“Ask­ing ques­tions like, what does the au­thor think or be­lieve or value, is a re­ally good start­ing point for crit­i­cal read­ing,” said Ms Davis, who also has a back­ground in psy­chol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“Stu­dents need to be able to have an opin­ion in or­der to judge sources, and par­ents can model that think­ing about the qual­ity of ques­tions they are ask­ing their kids when read­ing things on­line to­gether,” she added.</p>

    <p>Past askST@NLB ses­sions can also be found us­ing the link.</p>
    <p>The next askST@NLB ses­sion will be on the topic of “How to make the most of your an­nual leave”, with ST’s travel correspond­ent Clara Lock speak­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Keith Tan on Nov 27.</p>
