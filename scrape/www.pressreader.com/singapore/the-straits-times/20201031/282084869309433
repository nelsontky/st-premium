    <p>Next week’s United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion is be­ing closely watched in South Asia. Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris is cer­tainly a draw as she could be the first Amer­i­can vice-pres­i­dent of In­dian her­itage should the Democrats win.</p>
    <p>But the in­ter­est in the elec­tion out­come goes be­yond Sen­a­tor Har­ris’ back­ground. The ties that bind the US and South Asia have grown in re­cent years, in many var­ied ways. At one level, the In­dian di­as­pora in Amer­ica is be­ing wooed with some in­ten­sity by both the Democrats and Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>While the di­as­pora stands at</p>
    <p>4.5 mil­lion, the vot­ers are said to be around two mil­lion, with small but sig­nif­i­cant num­bers in some bat­tle­ground states that are ex­pected to pick the win­ner in the pres­i­den­tial race.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the US govern­ment is con­sol­i­dat­ing the ad­vances made to­wards In­dia in the last few years. It is not quite usual for two top US Cab­i­net mem­bers to ar­rive to­gether at a dis­tant cor­ner in the world barely a week be­fore bit­terly con­tested na­tional polls. But that ex­actly is what US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo and De­fence Sec­re­tary Mark Esper did this week when they trav­elled to Delhi for a “two plus two” di­a­logue with In­dian For­eign Min­is­ter Subrah­manyam Jais­hankar and De­fence Min­is­ter Ra­j­nath Singh.</p>
    <p>The meet­ings cel­e­brated the ex­tra­or­di­nary progress in bi­lat­eral ties in the tur­bu­lent Trump years and presided over the sign­ing of a new agree­ment on bi­lat­eral de­fence co­op­er­a­tion. The four min­is­ters also is­sued a ring­ing joint state­ment on the shared in­ter­ests in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>As his re­cent wont, Mr Pom­peo at­tacked the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Part while in Delhi. The Modi govern­ment might not have been too com­fort­able with such crit­i­cism from its soil, but at the same time In­dia too has its own China chal­lenge – its sol­diers are locked in a stand-off with the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army in the high Hi­malayas that’s en­ter­ing its sev­enth month.</p>
    <p>THE INDO-PA­CIFIC LEGACY</p>
    <p>Mr Esper has de­scribed In­dia as the most con­se­quen­tial part­ner for the US in the 21st cen­tury. Fu­ture his­to­ri­ans look­ing at the last four years might con­clude that the for­mal­i­sa­tion of a new strate­gic ge­og­ra­phy, the Indo-Pa­cific, and el­e­vat­ing the se­cu­rity en­gage­ment with Delhi are prob­a­bly among the last­ing le­ga­cies of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s first (and only?) term at the White House.</p>
    <p>But the story is not just about In­dia. Mr Pom­peo trav­elled from Delhi to Maldives and Sri Lanka be­fore head­ing out to Jakarta and Hanoi. The fram­ing for the en­tire visit was clear – it’s the US re­sponse to the rapid ex­pan­sion of China’s pro­file in the Indo-Pa­cific. Mr Pom­peo’s deputy, Mr Steve Biegun, trav­elled to Dhaka af­ter his visit to Delhi ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Un­til re­cently mar­itime South Asia was widely viewed as a strate­gic back­wa­ter. That per­cep­tion has dra­mat­i­cally changed in re­cent years, as the wa­ters of South Asia fig­ure promi­nently in China’s Mar­itime Silk Road and Bei­jing’s long-term strat­egy to project mil­i­tary power into the In­dian Ocean.</p>
    <p>In Colombo, Mr Pom­peo pub­licly warned Sri Lanka of the dan­gers of ex­ces­sive eco­nomic de­pen­dence on China and close se­cu­rity ties to Bei­jing. In Male, he cel­e­brated the re­cent ad­vances in bi­lat­eral ties be­yond the de­fence co­op­er­a­tion agree­ment that the two coun­tries signed last month.</p>
    <p>As for Pak­istan, it has long been a ma­jor part­ner for the US in the re­gion and is for­mally des­ig­nated as a ma­jor non-Nato ally. Pak­istan re­mains rather im­por­tant as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is fo­cused on with­drawal from Afghanista­n. Since the Sept 11, 2001, ter­ror­ist at­tacks on the US, Afghanista­n has been the dom­i­nant prism through which Wash­ing­ton saw the re­gion. In Au­gust 2017, Mr Trump un­veiled a South Asia pol­icy which in essence was about Afghanista­n. It gave the US one more mil­i­tary shot at sta­bil­is­ing Afghanista­n and mount­ing some pres­sure on Pak­istan to bring the Tale­ban to the ne­go­ti­at­ing ta­ble; and both were driven by do­mes­tic pol­i­tics. Mr Trump has been ea­ger to leave Afghanista­n at the ear­li­est, and wants to tell his sup­port­ers that he has kept the prom­ise to end Amer­ica’s end­less wars. It is an idea that has much res­o­nance too among the pro­gres­sives of the Demo­cratic Party.</p>
    <p>There is no ex­pec­ta­tion that a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion wants to rein­vig­o­rate the US mil­i­tary pres­ence in Afghanista­n, af­ter nearly two decades of oc­cu­pa­tion. Die-hard in­ter­na­tion­al­ists in the Bi­den es­tab­lish­ment might agree with Mr Trump’s for­mer na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser H. R. McMaster that the White House is try­ing to ap­pease the Tale­ban. But few are will­ing to put down po­lit­i­cal</p>
    <p>cap­i­tal now to save Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>But as the US fo­cus shifts from land wars to mar­itime con­tes­ta­tion with China, the Amer­i­can at­ten­tion has be­gun to move away from Pak­istan to build­ing a strong part­ner­ship with In­dia and re­new­ing ties to the smaller states of the re­gion. Pak­istan’s value for the US might be­come less salient.</p>
    <p>Over the last few years, the China chal­lenge has emerged as the prin­ci­pal in­ter­na­tional fo­cus for the US for­eign pol­icy es­tab­lish­ment and Mr Trump has presided over that de­fin­i­tive tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>For a po­ten­tial Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion too, China is likely to be the top­most pri­or­ity; but the ways it might ap­proach the is­sues in­volved are likely to be some­what dif­fer­ent from those of Mr Trump and will have a bear­ing on its ap­proach to In­dia and South Asia.</p>
    <p>The Democrats in­sist that they have no de­sire to pur­sue a new cold war with China. Mr Joe Bi­den says China is not a threat but a com­peti­tor that can and must be beaten. Un­like Mr Trump, he promises to bring Amer­ica’s al­lies to­gether in de­vel­op­ing a com­mon strat­egy to deal with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Some in Delhi, as prob­a­bly in Tokyo and Can­berra too, worry that Mr Bi­den might sim­ply go back to the poli­cies of the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion that em­pha­sised en­gage­ment with China at the cost of con­don­ing its re­gional ag­gres­sion. But there are oth­ers in In­dia who bet that the US se­cu­rity es­tab­lish­ment has moved de­ci­sively to­wards a strat­egy of stand­ing up to China’s as­sertive­ness and that it is un­likely to change much when the Democrats come to power.</p>
    <p>UNIONS AND CLI­MATE HAWKS</p>
    <p>In­dia, which has trade is­sues with most of its part­ners, will find the go­ing as tough with a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion as with the present one. Given the pres­sures on the Demo­cratic Party lead­er­ship to ac­com­mo­date its trade union sup­port­ers and its vo­cal pro­gres­sive wing, Mr Bi­den has said there will be no sign­ing of new free trade agree­ments with­out fac­tor­ing in the in­ter­ests of Amer­i­can work­ers.</p>
    <p>There are two other is­sues that a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion is likely to de­vi­ate markedly from the Trump White House. One is a re­turn of the</p>
    <p>US to the 2015 Paris cli­mate change ac­cord. While In­dia and its neigh­bours are likely to wel­come the shift, they might not be ready to en­gage with the Democrats’ “cli­mate hawks” who are dead set against the use of coal, which re­mains a ma­jor source of elec­tric power gen­er­a­tion in the sub-con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>The other is­sue is a re­newed fo­cus on hu­man rights. To be sure, hu­man rights is­sues have not re­ally dis­ap­peared from the US agenda un­der Mr Trump. Con­sider the spe­cial fo­cus on Xin­jiang, Ti­bet and Hong Kong in the last few months – all tar­geted at China. The sub-con­ti­nent has its share of prob­lems that draw hu­man rights con­cerns among the Democrats. Th­ese range from gen­der rights in Afghanista­n un­der Tale­ban rule to Pak­istan’s blas­phemy laws and Tamil mi­nor­ity rights in Sri Lanka to the repa­tri­a­tion of the Ro­hingya from Bangladesh to Myan­mar. Some Democrats have raised ques­tions about the Kash­mir sit­u­a­tion and In­dia’s Ci­ti­zen­ship (Amend­ment) Act.</p>
    <p>While the Democrats tend to em­pha­sise hu­man rights is­sues on the stump, their pres­i­dents have been as prag­matic as Repub­li­cans in ad­dress­ing them only on a se­lec­tive ba­sis while in power.</p>
    <p>That is un­likely to change un­der a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>FRAC­TIOUS DEMOCRATS</p>
    <p>The real chal­lenge for South Asian gov­ern­ments, as else­where in the world, will come from con­tin­u­ing un­cer­tainty in the US’ in­ter­na­tional tra­jec­tory un­der a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic ad­min­is­tra­tions are prone to deep in­ter­nal pol­icy con­tes­ta­tion, given the wide range of in­ter­ests that sup­port the party. That prob­lem is likely to get sharper un­der a pres­i­dent Bi­den, thanks to the grow­ing di­ver­sity and frac­tious­ness of the coali­tion that sup­ports him. The very mo­ment Mr Trump dis­ap­pears from the scene, the con­tra­dic­tions on the Demo­cratic side are likely to ex­press them­selves vig­or­ously.</p>
