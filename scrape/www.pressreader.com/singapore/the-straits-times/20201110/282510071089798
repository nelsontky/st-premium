    <p>At 31, Manasi Joshi is con­fi­dent, charm­ing and still likes dolls. One in par­tic­u­lar. Eleven-and-a-half inches long and hand­crafted, it sits in a display case in her liv­ing room in Ahmed­abad, In­dia.</p>
    <p>Looks like her. No, wait, it’s made in hon­our of her.</p>
    <p>The doll, a Bar­bie, is unique be­cause there’s no other like it in the world. It’s an orig­i­nal and it has a pros­thetic leg.</p>
    <p>Just like Joshi.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­al­is­tic,” says the 2019 world para bad­minton cham­pion hap­pily about the doll. The pros­thetic on it is like the one she wears. The shoes are like the ones she had. “It’s great.”</p>
    <p>Just like Joshi.</p>
    <p>She’s great not just be­cause of the doll, which is part of a Bar­bie col­lec­tion that cel­e­brates role mod­els and puts her in the com­pany of diver Wu Minxia. Great not merely be­cause Time mag­a­zine put her on the cover of its is­sue on Next Gen­er­a­tion Lead­ers. But great be­cause she has what the para move­ment al­ways needs, es­pe­cially in Asia.</p>
    <p>A voice.</p>
    <p>Hers is pos­i­tive, strong, funny and ma­tur­ing. Dur­ing a TED talk she kid­ded that hav­ing a pros­thetic leg has its ben­e­fits. A 50 per cent dis­count dur­ing pedi­cures.</p>
    <p>Para ath­letes can be hes­i­tant be­cause it’s how Asian so­ci­eties of­ten are with them. Jonathan Sel­varaj, an ESPN In­dia writer, says that “hav­ing in­ter­acted with mul­ti­ple para ath­letes (in In­dia), what usu­ally stood out with a few ex­cep­tions, was just how hard it was to get them to open up and also their painful shy­ness es­pe­cially when it came to deal­ing with their dis­abil­ity”.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ath­letes are of­ten kept in the ath­letic shad­ows and it takes poise to step into the lime­light and use it. Ev­ery tribe needs am­bas­sadors and this one has an agent and has posed for Vogue.</p>
    <p>Joshi lost her leg in 2011 in a road ac­ci­dent but she doesn’t dwell in the past. The only back­ward step we talk about is the one she takes on the bad­minton court be­cause it was so dif­fi­cult to mas­ter.</p>
    <p>“Pros­thet­ics are de­signed to al­low you to move for­ward,” she ex­plains, “they’re not de­signed to go back”. When she first started play­ing on her pros­thetic and mov­ing back­wards, her leg would buckle or she’d lose bal­ance.</p>
    <p>But, mostly, Joshi wants to move for­ward, a woman less in­ter­ested in pity than in progress. “Af­ter my dis­abil­ity,” she says, “I re­alised, yes, there are so many ar­eas which re­quire at­ten­tion. If I don’t do, who will. If not now, when? If there are is­sues, let’s be more vocal about it.”</p>
    <p>She’ll talk to you about the stereo­typ­ing of women and the doubt­ing of peo­ple with dis­abil­ity. She’ll talk about how peo­ple say women walk too slow, and ob­vi­ously none of them have seen Libby Clegg at work – the vis­ually-im­paired Scot­tish sprinter ran the 100m in Rio 2016 with a blind­fold on and hold­ing a guide run­ner in 11.91 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>Joshi will tell you Covid im­peded the dis­abled in unique ways – how do the blind not touch sur­faces? – and yet a strange em­pa­thy came into play with the iso­la­tion of ev­ery­one. “Peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties have been con­fined to their homes be­cause of mul­ti­ple rea­sons. So peo­ple un­der­stood how they feel.”</p>
    <p>Lit­tle girls re­quire all shades of he­roes, some who just play and oth­ers who tweet (she has 31,633 fol­low­ers), talk at schools and host the first day of an In­clu­sion Sum­mit as she did on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Find­ing equal­ity, of all types in all lands, is a hard scrap which in­volves toss­ing out out­dated ideas. In an e-mail, a Mat­tel spokesman wrote that “all the women hon­oured by Bar­bie chal­lenged gen­der ex­pec­ta­tions about women’s in­tel­li­gence, roles, ca­pa­bil­i­ties and power” and it is pre­cisely what Joshi is do­ing. Like Theresa Goh and Yip Pin Xiu have done in Sin­ga­pore, she is mak­ing us relook the world.</p>
    <p>Just af­ter her world ti­tle win in 2019, a man stopped her on the road and con­grat­u­lated her. “I have been fol­low­ing your jour­ney,” he told her, “and you have changed how I per­ceive a lot of things.” Life had tripped Joshi, yet she had stood up and found a new di­rec­tion. She changed her­self and now a stranger.</p>
    <p>The plat­form Joshi now owns has am­pli­fied her voice, but it is not the rea­son for it. Af­ter all, she comes from a home where she learnt that if there’s a prob­lem, even a pot­hole in the street, then speak up. As she says: “It’s just that I want to use my voice. I would have still raised my voice, but maybe few would have heard it. Now I have got a voice that is be­ing heard. I am very happy.”</p>
    <p>The Par­a­lympics hope­fully lie in her fu­ture and her doll rests in her cabi­net. Asked if she ever takes it out into the city to show peo­ple and she said no, it is kept at home.</p>
    <p>“It’s very frag­ile.”</p>
    <p>Which, one might say, is the only way it’s not like her.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail, a Mat­tel spokesman wrote that “all the women hon­oured by Bar­bie chal­lenged gen­der ex­pec­ta­tions about women’s in­tel­li­gence, roles, ca­pa­bil­i­ties and power” and it is pre­cisely what Joshi is do­ing. Like Theresa Goh and Yip Pin</p>
    <p>Xiu have done in Sin­ga­pore, she is mak­ing us relook the world.</p>
