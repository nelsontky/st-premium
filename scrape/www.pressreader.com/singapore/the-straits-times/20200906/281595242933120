    <p>Ms Parti Liyani was ac­cused of steal­ing two watches, var­i­ous fash­ion ac­ces­sories in­clud­ing rings and ear­rings, and a pair of Gucci sun­glasses from Mr Liew Mun Leong’s daugh­ter, Cheng May.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti said she had found the watches in Ms Liew’s rub­bish bin.</p>
    <p>They were coun­ter­feit; one, a “Vacheron Con­stantin”, had been bought from a Shang­hai street ven­dor in the 2000s, while the other was a Swatch that Ms Parti said she found in 2012.</p>
    <p>Ms Liew said she had not dis­carded the watches. Jus­tice Chan, how­ever, ac­cepted the de­fence’s ar­gu­ment that “as an in­vest­ment banker from an af­flu­ent fam­ily, it makes it prob­a­ble that May had dis­carded these coun­ter­feit watches given her ‘so­cial sta­tus’ by 2012”.</p>
    <p>As for the fash­ion ac­ces­sories, Ms Liew said she last saw them in 2004 be­fore leav­ing for the United States and did not throw them away af­ter she re­turned in 2010.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti said she bought some of the ear­rings and found most of the ac­ces­sories in Ms Liew’s rub­bish bin in 2011 or 2012. The judge said the pros­e­cu­tion had not proved be­yond rea­son­able doubt that Ms Liew had not dis­carded the ac­ces­sories. As for the sun­glasses, Ms Parti said she found them in her room when she started work­ing for the fam­ily. Other maids had worked for the fam­ily be­fore her.</p>
    <p>The judge said Ms Parti may have ac­ci­den­tally packed them with her other be­long­ings given the short amount of time she had to pack.</p>
