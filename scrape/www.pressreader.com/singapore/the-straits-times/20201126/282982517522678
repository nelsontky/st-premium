    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>It may feel like a race, but al­most all the pres­sure is com­ing from within. Slow down and take things as they come or you risk burn­ing your­self out.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>Set your­self up to re­ceive the praise you de­serve. Your great en­ergy is per­fect for dis­cern­ing be­tween flat­tery and gen­uine en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You can usu­ally dis­tin­guish what is im­por­tant and what is not. But the air is so filled with chat­ter that you can­not think straight. Roll past this phase.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your home life gets a boost, ei­ther through an end to a sim­mer­ing feud or a new re­la­tion­ship that bol­sters the old ones. Make the most of this.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>So­cial­is­ing does not rank high on your to-do list, but you still have to in­ter­act with peo­ple from dif­fer­ent so­cial cir­cles. You can han­dle it all fine.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Travel is on your mind, even if you can­not break away for some time. Make plans or do some re­search to fig­ure out what you want to do next.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You stay calm while oth­ers are heated up over the big news. They may won­der how you can be so re­laxed, but it is not for lack of car­ing.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Your per­sonal power is strong, but you may still find it dif­fi­cult to get your way. Try to re­di­rect and get some­thing else equally im­por­tant taken care of.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Some­one needs you to be nice to him or her and you are happy to oblige. You may not want to do much more than that if you want to pre­serve your en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Try to stay true to your goals – not that it is all that hard. You just need to make sure that you do not take on more than you re­ally can.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You learn some­thing new and ex­cit­ing. You need to shake things up and pre­pare the ground­work for the thrilling times ahead.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You have to un­ravel a big mys­tery, but you do not know where to start.</p>
    <p>You are com­fort­able with am­bi­gu­ity, so pick a ques­tion and start ask­ing.</p>
