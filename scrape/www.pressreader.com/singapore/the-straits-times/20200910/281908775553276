    <p>China ac­cused Aus­tralia yes­ter­day of bru­tal ha­rass­ment of jour­nal­ists as it emerged that the Aus­tralian au­thor­i­ties had tar­geted sev­eral Chi­nese jour­nal­ists and aca­demics over an al­leged at­tempt by Bei­jing to in­flu­ence a New South Wales MP, Mr Shao­quett Mosel­mane.</p>
    <p>ABC News re­ported that the fig­ures tar­geted in June were mem­bers of a WeChat group which was sus­pected of be­ing used to “en­cour­age Mr Mosel­mane to ad­vo­cate for the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>Two of the Chi­nese jour­nal­ists tar­geted were iden­ti­fied by ABC News as the Aus­tralia bu­reau chief of China News Ser­vice, Ms Tao She­lan, and China Ra­dio In­ter­na­tional’s Syd­ney bu­reau chief, Mr Li Day­ong.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese me­dia said two other Chi­nese jour­nal­ists were also tar­geted.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, it emerged that two China schol­ars who were mem­bers of the WeChat group had their visas re­voked. The schol­ars were named as Aus­tralian Stud­ies pro­fes­sor Chen Hong, from East China Nor­mal Univer­sity in Shang­hai, and Mr Li Jian­jun, di­rec­tor of the Aus­tralian Stud­ies Cen­tre at Bei­jing For­eign Stud­ies Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Prof Chen said yes­ter­day he was ad­vised that his visa had been can­celled be­cause he had been deemed a threat to na­tional se­cu­rity by the Aus­tralian Se­cu­rity In­tel­li­gence Or­gan­i­sa­tion, the coun­try’s do­mes­tic spy agency.</p>
    <p>He de­nied the claim. “I ab­so­lutely refuse to ac­cept this as­sess­ment, and be­lieve a gross mis­take has been made re­gard­ing my re­la­tion­ship with Aus­tralia,” he told ABC News.</p>
    <p>“The group was a most or­di­nary so­cial net­work plat­form on which mem­bers used to share jokes and funny memes... The al­le­ga­tion that the group had been pur­ported as a means of in­flu­ence is sim­ply pre­pos­ter­ous.”</p>
    <p>Re­ports of the raids by the Aus­tralian au­thor­i­ties on the homes of Chi­nese jour­nal­ists first ap­peared in Chi­nese me­dia out­lets yes­ter­day, as ten­sions be­tween the two na­tions con­tin­ued to mount.</p>
    <p>Can­berra ex­pressed dis­ap­point­ment this week at the treat­ment of two Aus­tralian jour­nal­ists who were forced to hur­riedly leave China af­ter be­ing ac­cused by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties of be­ing in­volved in a na­tional se­cu­rity case.</p>
    <p>For the first time since 1973, the Aus­tralian me­dia has no jour­nal­ists in China, its largest trad­ing part­ner.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing now ap­pears to be in­di­cat­ing that the treat­ment of the two Aus­tralian jour­nal­ists was a re­tal­i­a­tion for the treat­ment of Chi­nese re­porters in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian in­ves­ti­ga­tion al­legedly in­volved con­cerns that the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party had in­fil­trated the MP’s of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mr Mosel­mane and a part-time staff mem­ber of his of­fice, Mr John Zhang, an Aus­tralian cit­i­zen who moved from China in 1989, have de­nied any wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian yes­ter­day ac­cused Aus­tralia of “us­ing any ex­cuses to ha­rass and sup­press Chi­nese per­son­nel in Aus­tralia”.</p>
    <p>“We de­mand that Aus­tralia im­me­di­ately stop these bru­tal and un­rea­son­able acts,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The re­cent in­ves­ti­ga­tion of the two Aus­tralian jour­nal­ists in China – one from ABC and the other from The Aus­tralian Fi­nan­cial Re­view – is be­lieved to be re­lated to the de­ten­tion last month of Chi­nese-born Aus­tralian jour­nal­ist Cheng Lei, a pre­sen­ter for China Global Tele­vi­sion Net­work. Bei­jing has not pro­vided the rea­sons for Ms Lei’s de­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>The group was a most or­di­nary so­cial net­work plat­form on which mem­bers used to share jokes and funny memes.’’</p>
