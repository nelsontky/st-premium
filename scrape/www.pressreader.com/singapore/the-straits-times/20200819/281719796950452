    <p>SYD­NEY • A deadly out­break of the coro­n­avirus i n Aus­tralia’s state of Vic­to­ria stemmed al­most en­tirely from a ho­tel quar­an­tine scheme in­tended to house over­seas trav­ellers who had re­turned, an in­quiry has found.</p>
    <p>The out­come was re­ported as Aus­tralia yes­ter­day recorded its low­est one-day rise i n new Covid-19 in­fec­tions in a month, buoy­ing hopes that a strin­gent lockdown in the coun­try’s sec­ond­most pop­u­lous state has pre­vented a fresh wave of cases na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has also se­cured ac­cess to a promis­ing po­ten­tial coro­n­avirus vac­cine, Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son an­nounced yes­ter­day, say­ing that the coun­try would man­u­fac­ture it and of­fer free doses to the en­tire pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria has ex­pe­ri­enced a resur­gence of Covid-19 since late June, peak­ing at 725 daily in­fec­tions on Aug 5 and prompt­ing a re­turn to strict lockdown, in­clud­ing a nightly cur­few in the state cap­i­tal Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>Dr Ben How­den, a med­i­cal mi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist and in­fec­tious dis­eases physi­cian, told an in­quiry into the ho­tel quar­an­tine scheme on Mon­day that ac­cord­ing to ge­nomic se­quenc­ing, 99 per cent of Vic­to­ria’s cases as of l ate l ast month could be traced back to peo­ple re­turn­ing from over­seas.</p>
    <p>He did not re­fer di­rectly to the ho­tel quar­an­tine pro­gramme, but it has been the pol­icy of the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment for all re­turn­ing trav­ellers to un­dergo ho­tel quar­an­tine, op­er­ated at a state level since March.</p>
    <p>With Vic­to­ria’s daily case num­bers sub­sid­ing in re­cent weeks, at­ten­tion has turned firmly to the fail­ures of the ho­tel quar­an­tine sys­tem, with al­le­ga­tions that it was mis­han­dled, al­low­ing the in­fec­tion to spread to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Ev­i­dence has shown mul­ti­ple lapses of pro­to­col from se­cu­rity guards, who crit­ics say were not suf­fi­ciently trained or equipped for work­ing in virus con­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>Mi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist and in­fec­tious dis­eases expert Lind­say Grayson told the in­quiry that an on­line train­ing pro­gramme for the guards was con­fus­ing and mis­lead­ing. “The ma­jor­ity of it is like a train­ing mo­d­ule for the gen­eral pub­lic, rather than some­one who is go­ing to come into di­rect con­tact with or be re­spon­si­ble for man­ag­ing Covid-19 pa­tients,” said Dr Grayson.</p>
    <p>Bar­ris­ter Tony Neal said the in­quiry would seek to de­ter­mine who was re­spon­si­ble for over­see­ing the pro­gramme and whether the train­ing of staff was suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, led by cases in Vic­to­ria state, Aus­tralia said it has de­tected 226 new in­fec­tions in the past 24 hours – the low­est since July 18, when 212 cases were recorded. The na­tional fig­ure is well be­low the more than 700 in­fec­tions de­tected in a sin­gle day ear­lier this month, al­most all of which were in Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has now recorded more than 23,700 cases, while the death toll rose to 438 after 17 peo­ple in Vic­to­ria died from the virus in the last 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said yes­ter­day that Aus­tralia has signed a deal with drug­maker As­traZeneca to se­cure a po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“If this vac­cine proves suc­cess­ful, we will man­u­fac­ture and sup­ply vac­cines straight away un­der our own steam and make it free for 25 mil­lion Aus­tralians,” he added.</p>
