    <p>With the rest of the global avi­a­tion in­dus­try reel­ing from the fall­out of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, China has bucked the trend, with a rapid re­cov­ery and pas­sen­ger loads close to last year’s.</p>
    <p>Some 13.2 mil­lion trips were taken on flights dur­ing the re­cently con­cluded Na­tional Day hol­i­day, about 91 per cent of last year’s av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Other air­lines can only look on en­vi­ously, with the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion (Iata) warn­ing on Tues­day that car­ri­ers would need more gov­ern­ment sup­port to weather the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­try burns some US$300,000 (S$406,300) ev­ery minute, Iata said.</p>
    <p>De­spite car­ri­ers war­ily restart­ing oper­a­tions, ca­pac­ity and flight slot re­stric­tions have meant that air­lines will col­lec­tively lose US$77 bil­lion in the sec­ond half of this year, while a slow re­cov­ery next year would likely lose them US$5 bil­lion to US$6 bil­lion a month.</p>
    <p>But China is in “bet­ter shape” be­cause of its large do­mes­tic mar­ket, and hav­ing restarted flights, said Iata chief econ­o­mist Brian Pearce.</p>
    <p>“(For) Chi­nese air­lines, (the do­mes­tic mar­ket) con­sti­tutes a ma­jor por­tion of their rev­enue, so they’re in much bet­ter shape,” he told a reg­u­lar me­dia brief­ing.</p>
    <p>“But, for the ma­jor­ity of the rest of the world, par­tic­u­larly air­lines de­pen­dent on in­ter­na­tional mar­kets, there’s very lit­tle dif­fer­ence.”</p>
    <p>The sec­tor’s re­cov­ery also got a boost from the mega Na­tional Day hol­i­day. Usu­ally a week long, it was ex­tended by a day this year be­cause it co­in­cided with the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>“Due to the re­cent sta­ble do­mes­tic epi­demic con­trol sit­u­a­tion... pas­sen­gers’ will­ing­ness to travel has in­creased sig­nif­i­cantly,” the Civil Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion of China said.</p>
    <p>In some ma­jor tourist des­ti­na­tions, pas­sen­ger loads have reached or are close to pre-pan­demic lev­els, the reg­u­la­tor added.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion data firm OAG wrote in a blog post this week: “For one of the largest mar­kets in the world to be op­er­at­ing with ca­pac­ity close to Jan­uary’s lev­els re­flects a ma­jor struc­tural change of fo­cus to­wards do­mes­tic ser­vices.”</p>
    <p>Last month, an HSBC Global Re­search report sug­gested that China’s “Big Three” – China East­ern, China South­ern and Air China – could be in the black for the quar­ter end­ing Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Still, the three car­ri­ers posted losses of US$4 bil­lion in the first half and any profit is un­likely to stem the bleed­ing by year’s end.</p>
    <p>Earn­ings will also be ham­pered by a lack of in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers and un­lim­ited flight passes that some air­lines have of­fered, an­a­lyst Ivan Su, from Morn­ings­tar, said in an in­ter­view with CNBC.</p>
    <p>These passes, which al­low pas­sen­gers un­lim­ited flights within a set time pe­riod, are un­likely to gen­er­ate as much in­come as in­di­vid­ual tickets.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, while air­lines in China of­ten rely on do­mes­tic pas­sen­gers for ca­pac­ity, do­mes­tic travel is not as prof­itable as in­ter­na­tional flights.</p>
    <p>“While Chi­nese avi­a­tion will garner good in­ter­nal traf­fic num­bers, air­lines there will be los­ing out not just on in­ter­na­tional traf­fic, they’ll be los­ing out on se­ri­ous rev­enue and yield,” said in­de­pen­dent avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Saj Ah­mad.</p>
    <p>“Let’s face it, China may have big do­mes­tic de­mand, but it is nowhere near as prof­itable as the do­mes­tic US mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Given the global avi­a­tion slump, China might pos­si­bly emerge from this year as the top per­form­ing mar­ket, he said, not­ing that the re­sump­tion of in­ter­na­tional travel and the new form it might take all re­main ques­tions to be an­swered.</p>
