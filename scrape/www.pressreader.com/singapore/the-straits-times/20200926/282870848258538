    <p>The fa­ther of late Tai­wanese singer-ac­tor-host Alien Huang turned 60 ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>To mark the oc­ca­sion, Huang’s younger sis­ter Ting-ting posted a photo on In­sta­gram on Thurs­day, in which she and her brother’s girl­friend – cheer­leader Wu Han-chun – recre­ated the last photo the late tele­vi­sion host took with his fam­ily on Fa­ther’s Day this year.</p>
    <p>In it, Huang’s nephew is sit­ting on Wu’s lap and she is cup­ping his face. Huang’s fa­ther has his arms around his daugh­ter and Wu, 30.</p>
    <p>Ting-ting wrote: “Dad, this year’s birth­day is harder to get through. Along with our loss, we have gained so much too. I just hope that you are well. Please be healthy, happy and live your life well. As long you are well, we are too. Happy birth­day Dad. We love you.”</p>
    <p>The elder Huang’s birth­day comes just days af­ter a me­mo­rial ser­vice for his son.</p>
    <p>Huang was found dead in his home last Wed­nes­day at the age of 36. An au­topsy re­vealed he had died of an aor­tic dis­sec­tion – a car­dio­vas­cu­lar con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>In her In­sta­gram Sto­ries, Tingt­ing up­loaded the same pic­ture and wrote: “Brother, we’re tak­ing good care of dad.”</p>
    <p>She also posted a screen­shot of a video call she and her fa­ther had with Huang’s high school clique, which in­cludes ac­tress Ann Hsu and singer Rainie Yang, who was also Huang’s high-school sweet­heart.</p>
