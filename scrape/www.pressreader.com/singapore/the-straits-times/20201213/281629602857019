    <p>PARIS • Sci­en­tists said on Fri­day they had iden­ti­fied ge­netic vari­ants that made pa­tients more likely to de­velop se­vere Covid-19, in a break­through that could see new and ex­ist­ing drugs help pa­tients sur­vive the ill­ness.</p>
    <p>To de­ter­mine why some peo­ple de­velop se­vere lung in­flam­ma­tion when sick with Covid-19, re­searchers an­a­lysed mu­ta­tions on the genomes of more than 2,000 crit­i­cally ill pa­tients across Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>They com­pared their ge­netic make-up with that of a con­trol group and iden­ti­fied as many as eight se­quences that were more com­mon among the Covid-19 pa­tients. They found that these se­quences are in­volved in the body’s in­flam­ma­tory re­sponse and how the im­mune sys­tem bat­tles pathogens such as the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Af­ter fur­ther com­puter anal­y­sis, they high­lighted two spe­cific genes – TYK2 and CCR2 – that en­code in­flam­ma­tory pro­tein mol­e­cules.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers found that in­di­vid­u­als who pro­duce more of the TYK2 en­zyme ap­peared to be at higher risk of de­vel­op­ing se­vere Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We’re try­ing to cut through the tremen­dous com­plex­ity of the hu­man im­mune sys­tem to find the levers that we can pull that will change the out­come for the pa­tient,” said Univer­sity of Ed­in­burgh ge­neti­cist Ken­neth Bail­lie, who is also lead au­thor of the study pub­lished in Na­ture. “The beauty of ge­net­ics is that it can pre­dict the ef­fects that a drug might have. The re­ally ex­cit­ing thing about this study is that we have found genes that are di­rectly ther­a­peu­ti­cally rel­e­vant, so they lead us di­rectly to treat­ment.”</p>
    <p>Dr Bail­lie said that there is al­ready a group of drugs on the mar­ket that lim­its the ac­tion of TYK2. These are known as JAK in­hibitors and are of­ten pre­scribed for chronic diseases such as can­cer and arthri­tis. “We showed that peo­ple who pro­duce more TYK2 are more at risk of Covid. And there’s a drug that in­hibits it,” he told jour­nal­ists via video-link.</p>
    <p>The au­thors noted that there was also an an­ti­body treat­ment cur­rently in clin­i­cal tri­als that blocks CCR2, a pro­tein in­volved in im­mune re­sponse. They said widescale tri­als were ur­gently needed to test these treat­ments on pa­tients with se­vere Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dr Mark Caulfield, chief sci­en­tist for Ge­nomics Eng­land and di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute for Health Re­search Biomed­i­cal Re­search Cen­tre at Barts Hos­pi­tal, called Fri­day’s re­search “a re­mark­able re­sult”. He said the team’s study of pa­tient genomes could even­tu­ally cre­ate a “com­pre­hen­sive in­ven­tory of vari­ants that change our sus­cep­ti­bil­ity to the sever­ity of Covid”.</p>
