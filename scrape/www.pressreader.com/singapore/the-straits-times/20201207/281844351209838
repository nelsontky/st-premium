    <p>As a hope­ful world em­barks on the great vac­ci­na­tion drive of 2020-21, it is im­por­tant to stay cleareyed about this un­prece­dented ex­er­cise. Gains look cer­tain but could be smaller than they ap­pear at this junc­ture. The new phase in tack­ling the coro­n­avirus pan­demic gets un­der way this week as cases world­wide head to­wards the 70 mil­lion mark. The United States, with the largest in­ci­dence of Covid-19, at 14.5 mil­lion cases, could be­gin vac­ci­na­tions as soon as Fri­day. Bri­tain, the first Western na­tion to li­cense a coro­n­avirus vac­cine, plans a roll-out to­mor­row. In­dia, which has the sec­ond-high­est num­ber of cases, ex­pects to follow a few weeks later. China has been in­oc­u­lat­ing thou­sands of cit­i­zens since June un­der an emer­gency-use pro­gramme. Rus­sia, which also de­vel­oped an in­dige­nous vac­cine, launched its mass drive two days ago. Sin­ga­pore is in the midst of se­cur­ing a di­verse port­fo­lio of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>It is an ex­tra­or­di­nary feat to have ar­rived at the vac­ci­na­tion stage just months af­ter the novel virus be­gan spread­ing across the world. Press­ing into use new tech­nolo­gies, sci­en­tists have achieved re­mark­able re­sults in a process that usu­ally takes sev­eral years. Man­u­fac­tur­ers are ramp­ing up to de­liver the bil­lions of doses that will even­tu­ally be needed, while gov­ern­ments are set­ting in place prin­ci­ples to pri­ori­tise who gets vac­ci­nated first. But there are for­mi­da­ble hur­dles in this jour­ney to the last mile.</p>
    <p>Some of the vac­cines re­quire trans­porta­tion and stor­age in ul­tra-cool con­di­tions that are be­yond the scope of poorer na­tions. In to­day’s glob­alised world, vac­ci­na­tion drives that stop at the bor­ders can­not con­tain a highly in­fec­tious virus like Sars-CoV-2. These lim­i­ta­tions are on top of the chal­lenges in­her­ent in the vac­cines them­selves. Clin­i­cal tri­als have shown that vac­cines will pro­tect nine out of 10 peo­ple. This im­plies that they will fail on mil­lions of oth­ers. The ini­tial in­oc­u­la­tion drives will need to leave out chil­dren and peo­ple with cancer and other dis­eases be­cause the vac­cines have not been tested on them. Thus, for many fam­i­lies, not all mem­bers can be vac­ci­nated. Fur­ther­more, none of the vac­cines guar­an­tees life­long im­mu­nity, and it is yet un­clear if they can stop an in­oc­u­lated in­di­vid­ual from pass­ing on the in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>On its own, then, a vac­cine can­not end the pan­demic. It can com­ple­ment other on­go­ing con­tain­ment mea­sures, not re­place them. So­cial dis­tanc­ing, masks and con­tact trac­ing are in­dis­pens­able un­til herd im­mu­nity is achieved. So, eu­phoric stock mar­kets and pro­jec­tions of Vshaped re­cov­er­ies may be pre­ma­ture. The bat­tle is far from won. Gov­ern­ments, af­ter hav­ing spent tril­lions to pro­tect their economies, will need to bud­get their re­sources care­fully for con­tin­gen­cies ahead. Promis­ing as these be­gin­nings are, these times call for ex­tra­or­di­nary pru­dence.</p>
