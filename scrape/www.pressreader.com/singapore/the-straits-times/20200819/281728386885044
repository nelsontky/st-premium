    <p>SEOUL • South Korea tight­ened so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules yes­ter­day as it re­ported a three-digit in­crease in coro­n­avirus cases for a fifth day and the au­thor­i­ties scram­bled to trace hun­dreds of mem­bers of a church congregati­on.</p>
    <p>The Korea Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion (KCDC) re­ported 246 new cases as of midnight on Mon­day, bring­ing its to­tal in­fec­tions to 15,761. With one new death re­ported, the coun­try has seen a to­tal of 306 Covid-19 deaths.</p>
    <p>South Korea has been one of the world’s coro­n­avirus mit­i­ga­tion suc­cess sto­ries, but it has suf­fered re­peated spikes in cases.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun said 12 high-risk busi­ness cat­e­gories, in­clud­ing night­clubs, karaoke bars and buf­fet restau­rants, will cease op­er­a­tions from to­day in Seoul, In­cheon and the neigh­bour­ing Gyeonggi prov­ince.</p>
    <p>All pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions in the ar­eas, such as mu­se­ums, will also close, he added, while in­door gath­er­ings of more than 50 peo­ple, and out­door ones of more than 100, will also be pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>Be­tween them, the three ar­eas ac­count for half of South Korea’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“If we can’t get the virus un­der con­trol now, we’ll have to notch up so­cial dis­tanc­ing to higher lev­els, and that would have a big im­pact on our econ­omy and peo­ple’s liveli­hoods,” Mr Chung told a news con­fer­ence after an emer­gency meet­ing.</p>
    <p>At least 457 in­fec­tions have been linked to the Sarang Jeil Church, 10 of whom were con­firmed to have at­tended anti-gov­ern­ment demon­stra­tions dur­ing the past two week­ends in Seoul, Vice-Health Min­is­ter Kim Gang-lip told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are try­ing to trace some 500 other mem­bers of the congregati­on, to tell them to self­quar­an­tine and get tested as they posed the high­est trans­mis­sion risk, Mr Kim said.</p>
    <p>An­other clus­ter has been traced to a Star­bucks out­let out­side Seoul, with seven new cases tak­ing the tally there to 49.</p>
    <p>Two new cases were re­ported in the mil­i­tary, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions on bases to 88, the De­fence Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Some 461 mil­i­tary per­son­nel are in quar­an­tine, and all troops have been con­fined to base, with leave can­celled and vis­its halted.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have set out so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules in three stages, with stage 1 the least strict and stage 3 the tough­est, when schools are shut, work­ers are ad­vised to work from home and gath­er­ings lim­ited to 10 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Seoul is at stage 2, but KCDC deputy di­rec­tor Kwon Jun-wook told a brief­ing that the ef­fort is at a “grave cross­roads”, and stage 3 might be in­evitable. “High-risk gath­er­ings in the greater Seoul area could spread na­tion­wide,” he said.</p>
