    <p>As get-well-soon wishes poured in from world lead­ers on Fri­day after US Pres­i­dent Donald Trump said he had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, one voice was con­spic­u­ously ab­sent – that of Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga.</p>
    <p>Tokyo’s im­me­di­ate re­sponse was a bland state­ment from Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Kat­sunobu Kato, say­ing only that Ja­pan was “aware” that Mr Trump had taken ill but is in “good health con­di­tion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga yes­ter­day tweeted, in English and Ja­panese: “I was very wor­ried about you when I read your tweet say­ing that you and Madam First Lady tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. I sin­cerely pray for your early re­cov­ery and hope that you and Madam First Lady will re­turn to nor­mal life soon.”</p>
    <p>Con­trast this to his pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe, who broke di­plo­matic pro­to­col by meet­ing Mr Trump even be­fore he for­mally took of­fice, bring­ing as gifts gold-plated golf clubs to bur­nish a friend­ship with a mer­cu­rial per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>It worked won­ders.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers are cu­ri­ous as to the type of re­la­tion­ship that Mr Suga will come to forge with Mr Trump if he were to be re-elected, or with his Demo­crat op­po­nent Joe Bi­den, were he to pre­vail in the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion next month.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s ex­per­tise, honed from years as chief Cab­i­net sec­re­tary, has been in do­mes­tic is­sues and he is seen as a di­plo­matic green­horn. Be­ing much less showy than</p>
    <p>Mr Abe, he has not made any grand­stand­ing pledges, but will more likely work be­hind the scenes to score re­sults.</p>
    <p>The Mainichi daily, in an editorial last month, called on Mr Suga to be more proac­tive in­ter­na­tion­ally. It said: “Suga needs to show his own colours. Un­less he ac­tively presents his own vi­sion, it will be dif­fi­cult to build trust in in­ter­na­tional so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, Mr Suga faces tall hur­dles in nav­i­gat­ing Ja­pan’s myr­iad di­plo­matic mine­fields, in­clud­ing such long-stand­ing is­sues as North Korea and Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>The world’s third-largest econ­omy is also caught in the spat be­tween the US and China. Although Mr Abe had spent plenty of po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal try­ing to build bridges with Bei­jing, Mr Suga will find him­self hard-pressed to go against Wash­ing­ton now, noted Univer­sity of Tokyo po­lit­i­cal scientist Yu Uchiyama.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party is also against Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping mak­ing a state visit any­time soon, given that geopo­lit­i­cal un­cer­tain­ties are ris­ing over such is­sues as mil­i­tary as­sertive­ness and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The state visit had been planned for this April, but was in­def­i­nitely post­poned be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic. And although Mr Suga and Mr Xi agreed “to work closely to­gether” to build closer ties in their first phone call last month, the state visit was not dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>What Mr Suga is likely to do is to bet­ter ar­tic­u­late the Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific vi­sion, which had been mooted as a coun­ter­bal­ance to China but had been neb­u­lous un­der Mr Abe’s watch.</p>
    <p>Se­cu­rity ex­pert Tosh Mi­no­hara noted re­cent moves to give the Quad group of coun­tries – Ja­pan, the United States, Aus­tralia and In­dia – more teeth.</p>
    <p>The na­tions have entered into a se­ries of bi­lat­eral de­fence agree­ments, in­clud­ing most re­cently a lo­gis­tics-shar­ing pact</p>
    <p>Just 21/ weeks into Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s new ad­min­is­tra­tion, he is po­ten­tially chart­ing quite a dif­fer­ent course from 2 that of his pre­de­ces­sor Shinzo Abe. The Sun­day Times looks at his di­plo­matic and do­mes­tic pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga faces tall hur­dles in nav­i­gat­ing Ja­pan’s myr­iad di­plo­matic mine­fields, in­clud­ing such long-stand­ing is­sues as North Korea and Rus­sia. The world’s third-largest econ­omy is also caught in the spat be­tween the US and China.</p>
    <p>be­tween Ja­pan and In­dia, that “cut the bu­reau­cratic red tape and brings more prac­ti­cal ef­fec­tive­ness to Quad”.</p>
    <p>Ties with South Korea are also in deep freeze, over wartime is­sues – like that of req­ui­si­tioned work­ers – that con­tinue to cloud ties, as well as a trade dis­pute, with Ja­pan slap­ping ex­port re­stric­tions on ma­te­ri­als that are key to its semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Keio Univer­sity Pro­fes­sor Junya Nishino, in not­ing that a new leader of­fers a chance for a re­set of the re­la­tion­ship, said Mr Suga had not even men­tioned South Korea when dis­cussing di­plo­matic is­sues in his</p>
    <p>first news con­fer­ence as Prime Min­is­ter. “This could mean the se­vere policy from the Abe ad­min­is­tra­tion has been main­tained,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But an­other in­ter­pre­ta­tion, given that bi­lat­eral ties are at a nadir, is that it could be an ex­pres­sion of Mr Suga’s will to work on this mat­ter calmly and qui­etly.”</p>
    <p>He also saw as a pos­i­tive sign the fact that South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in was one of the first world lead­ers whom Mr Suga spoke to after he be­came Prime Min­is­ter. Mr Suga had told re­porters after the call on Sept 24: “The tough is­sues that have arisen be­tween the</p>
    <p>two coun­tries must not be left unat­tended.”</p>
    <p>Still, with the two na­tions at a cross­roads, ob­servers are look­ing at whether Mr Suga will at­tend a tri­lat­eral sum­mit with Chi­nese Premier Li Ke­qiang and Mr Moon, which Seoul is slated to host later this year.</p>
    <p>But source-based re­ports in Ja­panese me­dia last week cited of­fi­cials as say­ing that it would be “im­pos­si­ble” for Mr Suga to visit South Korea with­out a sat­is­fac­tory break­through in the wartime labour court case.</p>
