    <p>Vet­eran Malay singer R. Is­mail, whose singing ca­reer dates back to the 1960s, died at Sengkang Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal on Sun­day. The Sin­ga­porean was 83.</p>
    <p>His songs, such as Gurindam Jiwa (Soul Po­etry), a duet with l ate singer Rafeah Buang, are pop­u­lar in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Berita Har­ian re­ported that he had been in the hos­pi­tal’s in­ten­sive care unit for a week for heart and thy­roid is­sues.</p>
    <p>He came from a mu­si­cal fam­ily. His father, A. Rah­man, was a singer in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>
    <p>Two of his 10 chil­dren are also pop­u­lar Malay singers – Elfee Is­mail and Iskandar Is­mail. He last sang with them at Gurindam Jiwa – An Evening With R. Is­mail, a con­cert he head­lined at the Es­planade The­atre Stu­dio in 2018.</p>
    <p>In the 1960s, he sang for clas­sic Malay films such as ro­man­tic drama Bi­dasari (1965) and fan­tasy drama Jula Juli Bin­tang Tu­juh (Jula Juli Seven Stars, 1962). Gurindam Jiwa was from the sound­track of the sim­i­larly ti­tled 1965 film.</p>
    <p>He lived in Kuala Lumpur for a decade and re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in 2017.</p>
    <p>Per­son­al­i­ties f rom the Malay en­ter­tain­ment i ndus­try took to so­cial me­dia to pay trib­ute to the late singer. Singer Sufi Rashid and host-ac­tor Khairudin Sam­sudin both called him “a leg­end” in the arts and en­ter­tain­ment scene.</p>
    <p>He was buried at Pusara Aman Mus­lim ceme­tery i n Choa Chu Kang.</p>
