    <p>Four Sin­ga­pore stu­dents with spe­cial needs have de­signed a set of four stamps that went on sale yes­ter­day, with all pro­ceeds do­nated to char­ity.</p>
    <p>Done to co­in­cide with World Kind­ness Day, the ef­fort was launched by Sin­ga­pore Post (SingPost) at Minds Fern­vale Gar­dens School. Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob was the guest of hon­our.</p>
    <p>SingPost is pro­duc­ing 70,000 stamps, which can be bought in a set of four dif­fer­ent de­signs at $1.20, or in­di­vid­u­ally at 30 cents.</p>
    <p>SingPost will match dol­lar-for­dol­lar the sale pro­ceeds, help­ing to raise up to $168,000 for char­ity.</p>
    <p>The money will go to the Com­mu­nity Chest, in sup­port of Minds, which helps those with in­tel­lec­tual and de­vel­op­men­tal dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The stamps can be bought at all SingPost post of­fices and philatelic stores.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent said she hoped the ini­tia­tive would raise aware­ness and change pub­lic per­cep­tion of peo­ple with spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>“I am glad that SingPost has pro­vided this use­ful plat­form for stu­dents with spe­cial needs to show­case their talents and creative po­ten­tial through orig­i­nal art­works.</p>
    <p>“With the sup­port of cor­po­rate part­ners and wider com­mu­nity, it will shape a broader cul­ture of in­clu­siv­ity,” she added.</p>
    <p>The de­signs were cre­ated by Minds stu­dents in a con­test in July. Each of the four Minds schools was given a theme to fol­low: My Fam­ily, My School, My Dream and My Hob­bies. Judges from SingPost, Com­mu­nity Chest, Minds, Sin­ga­pore Philatelic Mu­seum and the Stamp Ad­vi­sory Com­mit­tee picked the win­ning de­signs from 16 en­tries.</p>
    <p>The four de­sign­ers, who have in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­i­ties, are Tan Zhe Kai, 16, Nu­rul Liyana Mohd Ar­shad, 15, Leong Shuyi, 14, and Di­man Ma­mat, 14. Each re­ceived a</p>
    <p>$1,000 cash prize from SingPost.</p>
    <p>The stamps will be af­fixed on the en­velopes of all Sea­son’s Greet­ings cards mailed from the Pres­i­dent’s Of­fice dur­ing the year-end fes­tive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Minds chief ex­ec­u­tive Kelvin Koh said: “SingPost not only gave our stu­dents a can­vas to ex­press what mat­ters most to them – their hob­bies, school, fam­ily and dreams – but more im­por­tantly, they hon­oured our stu­dents’ talents.”</p>
    <p>Teenager Di­man’s draw­ing, based on My Hob­bies, shows him and his friends play­ing in a park. He said: “I’m very happy my stamp was se­lected. My hobby is that I like to play with my friends, rid­ing bi­cy­cles, run­ning and play­ing on the scooter in the park near my house.”</p>
