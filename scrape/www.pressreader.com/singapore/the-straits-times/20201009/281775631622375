    <p>WASHINGTON Pa­tients are ask­ing to join clin­i­cal tri­als of an­ti­body-based Covid-19 drugs af­ter US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump was treated last week with an ex­per­i­men­tal ther­apy from Re­gen­eron Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, and promised on Wed­nes­day to make it free to Amer­i­cans while tout­ing its ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also de­clared that catch­ing the coro­n­avirus was a “bless­ing from God” that ex­posed him to ex­per­i­men­tal treat­ments.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal ex­perts said more data is needed to as­sess the Re­gen­eron ther­apy’s ef­fi­cacy be­fore wider use should be al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was dis­charged from hos­pi­tal late on Mon­day, af­ter an­nounc­ing early last Fri­day that he and his wife both had been di­ag­nosed with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to his doc­tor, blood tests on Mon­day de­tected in­fec­tion-fight­ing an­ti­bod­ies, which a Re­gen­eron spokesman said were prob­a­bly from the treat­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said on Wed­nes­day that it has sub­mit­ted a re­quest to the United States Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion for an emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion (EUA) for its an­ti­body com­bi­na­tion.</p>
    <p>In a video shot out­side the White House, Mr Trump cred­ited the Re­gen­eron ther­apy for his feel­ing much bet­ter than when he was first di­ag­nosed, and said he would push for EUAs of that treat­ment and oth­ers like it.</p>
    <p>He mis­tak­enly said the drug was called Re­gen­eron.</p>
    <p>Re­gen­eron’s drug is a cock­tail of two mon­o­clonal an­ti­bod­ies – man­u­fac­tured copies of an­ti­bod­ies that are one of the main weapons that the im­mune sys­tem gen­er­ates to fight in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The com­pany so far has re­leased some early data point­ing to the prom­ise of its ther­apy for</p>
    <p>Covid-19, and doc­tors were con­cerned Mr Trump’s treat­ment and sub­se­quent pro­mo­tion could put pres­sure on reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>Dr Gary Kleiner, a pae­di­atric im­mu­nol­o­gist at the Univer­sity of Mi­ami Miller School of Medicine and an in­ves­ti­ga­tor in a trial de­signed to see if Re­gen­eron’s an­ti­bod­ies can pre­vent coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion, said he has been ap­proached by pa­tients seek­ing the drug since last week.</p>
    <p>Dr Dirk Sost­man, head of the re­search net­work at Hous­ton Methodist Hos­pi­tal, a trial site for Re­gen­eron and Eli Lilly an­ti­body pro­grammes, said more pa­tients are ask­ing to par­tic­i­pate in an an­ti­body trial.</p>
    <p>He was cau­tious about al­low­ing broader use with­out more data.</p>
    <p>“All we have seen are very brief press re­leases... so there is not much to go on,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The pol­i­tics of the sit­u­a­tion would sug­gest to me that the story could be Trump gets Covid... then Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy fos­tered by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion cures Covid,” Dr Sost­man added.</p>
    <p>“I would think there would be pres­sure on reg­u­la­tors.”</p>
    <p>Top US in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert</p>
    <p>An­thony Fauci, speak­ing on Mon­day on CNN, said he was “strongly sus­pi­cious” that Re­gen­eron’s drug has con­trib­uted to Mr Trump’s progress.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously you can’t prove that un­til you do a num­ber of stud­ies to show that it ac­tu­ally works,” said Dr Fauci.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, in a video ad­dress re­leased on Wed­nes­day, said: “I think this was a bless­ing from God that I caught it. This was a bless­ing in dis­guise.”</p>
    <p>He added that his use of the med­i­ca­tion from Re­gen­eron had al­lowed him to ex­pe­ri­ence first­hand how ef­fec­tive it could be.</p>
    <p>“I want to get for you what I got. And I’m go­ing to make it free,” he said, at one point call­ing the un­ap­proved medicine a “cure”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who faces Demo­crat Joe Bi­den in the Nov 3 elec­tion, has had no Covid-19 symp­toms for the past 24 hours, said his doc­tor Sean Con­ley in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“He’s now been fever-free for more than four days, symp­tom­free for over 24 hours, and has not needed, nor re­ceived, any sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen since ini­tial hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion,” Dr Con­ley said.</p>
