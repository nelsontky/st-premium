    <p>• In the end, it was per­haps fit­ting that in an un­prece­dented Mo­toGP sea­son that saw the com­pe­ti­tion’s start date get de­layed by over four months due to the coro­n­avirus pandemic, Joan Mir be­came one of its most un­likely cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard won only one race all cam­paign, also com­ing in Va­len­cia at last week’s Grand Prix of Europe, but earned his maiden crown yes­ter­day, be­com­ing Suzuki’s first world cham­pion in two decades with a sev­enth-place fin­ish at the Va­len­cia Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Mir started the race with a 37-point lead over his clos­est chal­lengers – team­mate and com­pa­triot Alex Rins and French rider Fabio Quar­tararo of Petronas Yamaha.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old man­aged to se­cure a fourth suc­ces­sive top-10 fin­ish from 12th on the grid to em­u­late Amer­i­can Kenny Roberts Jr, who won the rid­ers’ cham­pi­onship for Suzuki in 2000.</p>
    <p>Rins could man­age only fourth place, while Quar­tararo’s ti­tle chal­lenge ended after crash­ing out on lap nine.</p>
    <p>With one race to go, Mir has an unas­sail­able 29-point lead over Petronas Yamaha’s Franco Mor­bidelli, with the Ital­ian hold­ing off a spir­ited chal­lenge from Pra­mac Rac­ing’s Jack Miller to seal his third vic­tory of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Spa­niard Pol Es­par­garo of KTM com­pleted the podium.</p>
    <p>On top of a slew of can­celled races – at just 14, there are five fewer grands prix com­pared to last year – de­fend­ing cham­pion Marc Mar­quez broke his arm in the sea­son-opener, rul­ing him out for the rest of the term.</p>
    <p>His freak in­jury blew the cham­pi­onship race wide open and Mir took ad­van­tage by be­ing the most con­sis­tent per­former.</p>
    <p>He cel­e­brated by pulling wheel­ies and screech­ing his smok­ing tyres in front of the pad­dock where his fam­ily were in per­son to cel­e­brate.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been fight­ing for this all my life, I can nei­ther laugh nor cry but I’m flooded with emo­tions,” he said. The sea­son fi­nale takes place at Por­ti­mao in Por­tu­gal on Sun­day.</p>
