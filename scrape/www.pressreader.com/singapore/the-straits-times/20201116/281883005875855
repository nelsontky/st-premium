    <p>TEGU­CI­GALPA • Less than two weeks after pow­er­ful storm Eta killed more than 200 peo­ple across Cen­tral Amer­ica, the au­thor­i­ties have warned that Hur­ri­cane Iota is set to wal­lop coastal ar­eas of Nicaragua and Hon­duras to­day.</p>
    <p>Iota – the lat­est in an un­usu­ally busy storm sea­son – was about 700km east-south-east of the Cabo Gra­cias a Dios on the Nicaragua-Hon­duras bor­der yes­ter­day, mov­ing slowly west­wards with max­i­mum sus­tained winds of 120kmh.</p>
    <p>Iota was up­graded to a hur­ri­cane early yes­ter­day, the Miami-based Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre (NHC) said.</p>
    <p>This year’s hur­ri­cane sea­son has seen a record 30 named trop­i­cal storms across the Caribbean, Cen­tral Amer­ica and the south-eastern United States.</p>
    <p>Iota was ex­pected to rapidly strengthen into a ma­jor hur­ri­cane as it ap­proached Cen­tral Amer­ica. “It is likely that the heavy rain­fall from Iota, through Thurs­day, will lead to life-threat­en­ing flash flood­ing and river flood­ing in parts of north­ern Colom­bia and Cen­tral Amer­ica,” the NHC warned.</p>
    <p>“The flood­ing and mud­slides in Hon­duras and Nicaragua may be ex­ac­er­bated by the re­cent ef­fects of Hur­ri­cane Eta in those ar­eas, re­sult­ing in sig­nif­i­cant im­pacts.”</p>
    <p>Hon­duras, Gu­atemala and Nicaragua an­nounced evac­u­a­tions last Friday, even as the re­gion was still reel­ing from the dev­as­ta­tion in­flicted by Eta.</p>
    <p>Eta hit the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua as a Cat­e­gory 4 storm, one of the strong­est November storms ever recorded. River banks burst and land­slides were trig­gered as far north as Chi­a­pas, Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>Separately, a mud­slide has killed at least three peo­ple, and four oth­ers re­main miss­ing in the eastern Gu­atemalan mu­nic­i­pal­ity of Camotan, near the bor­der with Hon­duras, ac­cord­ing to Gu­atemala’s Na­tional Co­or­di­na­tor for Disas­ter Re­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>The agency added that Eta left more than 150 peo­ple dead and miss­ing.</p>
