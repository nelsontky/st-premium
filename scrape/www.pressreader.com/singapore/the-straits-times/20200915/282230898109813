    <p>Catal­ist-listed Sin­ga­pore Kitchen Equip­ment said on Sun­day night that its hus­band-and-wife founders Sally Chua Ch­wee Choo and Alan Lee Chong Hoe, as well as group se­nior sales man­ager Alvin Chiao Shan Ren, were in­ter­viewed by the au­thor­i­ties in a cor­rup­tion probe.</p>
    <p>Ms Chua is the group’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, while Mr Lee is an ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>Ms Chua and Mr Chiao are on bail in re­la­tion to in­ves­ti­ga­tions into of­fences un­der Sec­tion 6(b) of the Preven­tion of Cor­rup­tion Act, the group said in a reg­u­la­tory up­date. It added that their pass­ports were sur­ren­dered to the Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau (CPIB).</p>
    <p>Ms Chua, Mr Lee and Mr Chiao were in­ter­viewed by the CPIB on or about Sept 10 in con­nec­tion with en­ter­tain­ment ex­penses and sales com­mis­sions re­lat­ing to cer­tain projects un­der­taken by Q’son Kitchen Equip­ment, a wholly owned sub­sidiary.</p>
    <p>The group, through Q’son, pro­vides com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial kitchen so­lu­tions for the food and bev­er­age and hospi­tal­ity ser­vices in­dus­tries. Ms Chua is also the man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Q’son.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Kitchen Equip­ment said the in­ves­ti­ga­tion is on­go­ing and no charges had been filed against Ms Chua, Mr Lee and Mr Chiao as of Sun­day. Its nom­i­nat­ing com­mit­tee is of the view that the trio re­main com­pe­tent and it would be in the group’s best in­ter­ests that they con­tinue to dis­charge their re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and du­ties in the op­er­a­tion of the group’s busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Al­though it is not aware of any im­pro­pri­ety or of­fence com­mit­ted by the trio, the board said it has ap­pointed so­lic­i­tors and an in­de­pen­dent re­viewer to, among other things, re­view the group’s in­ter­nal pro­cesses and in­ter­nal con­trols to fur­ther strengthen cor­po­rate gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Kitchen Equip­ment on Sun­day re­quested to lift a trad­ing halt called on Sept 11. The counter last traded at 9.8 cents on Aug 20.</p>
    <p>The board said it has ap­pointed so­lic­i­tors and an in­de­pen­dent re­viewer to, among other things, re­view the group’s in­ter­nal pro­cesses and in­ter­nal con­trols to fur­ther strengthen cor­po­rate gov­er­nance.</p>
