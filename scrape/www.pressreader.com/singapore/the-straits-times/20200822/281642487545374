    <p>Recorded mu­sic at food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets can only be played softly in the back­ground so pa­trons do not have to raise their voices to be heard, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, who co-chairs a multi-min­istry task force bat­tling Covid-19, said: “This is a con­cern be­cause of the risk of peo­ple speak­ing loudly and droplets spread­ing, es­pe­cially when din­ers are in a res­tau­rant in close prox­im­ity within a ta­ble, with­out their masks on.</p>
    <p>“So, as an added pre­cau­tion, we will tighten the rules to make very clear to all F&B out­lets that recorded mu­sic at these out­lets will only be al­lowed as soft back­ground mu­sic.”</p>
    <p>Live mu­sic and live broad­casts – both on tele­vi­sion and ra­dio – as well as video screen­ings re­main dis­al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong also said that the task force is look­ing into sit­u­a­tions where peo­ple are booking mul­ti­ple ta­bles at a sin­gle res­tau­rant so that groups of more than five can gather.</p>
    <p>He said: “We urge ev­ery­one to re­frain from booking mul­ti­ple ta­bles for large gath­er­ings in a res­tau­rant. We also seek the co­op­er­a­tion of F&B op­er­a­tors not to ac­cept such reser­va­tions.”</p>
    <p>House­holds with more than five mem­bers who want to share a meal to­gether are the only groups who are ex­empt, and can book more than one ta­ble.</p>
    <p>“There should not be or­gan­ised events, cel­e­bra­tions or par­ties in an F&B set­ting in­volv­ing mul­ti­ple ta­bles,” he said, whether or not the ta­bles are in a res­tau­rant’s gen­eral seat­ing area or in a pri­vate room.</p>
    <p>“There should not be such gath­er­ings be­cause peo­ple in such gath­er­ings tend to be min­gling amongst them­selves with­out their masks on, and there are risks of large clus­ters form­ing in such set­tings.”</p>
    <p>En­force­ment of­fi­cers will be step­ping up their checks on F&B out­lets, and they will take en­force­ment ac­tion against in­di­vid­u­als or F&B op­er­a­tors in breach of safe dis­tanc­ing rules, he added.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, hot­pot res­tau­rant Hai Xian Lao in Shaw House, in Or­chard Road, was fined $2,000 and or­dered to sus­pend op­er­a­tions for 10 days for fail­ing to com­ply with safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded fail­ing to en­sure that group sizes did not ex­ceed five peo­ple.</p>
    <p>En­force­ment of­fi­cers had no­ticed a group of more than 20 peo­ple leav­ing the res­tau­rant, and fur­ther checks re­vealed that the group had been seated in a locked pri­vate room within the res­tau­rant.</p>
