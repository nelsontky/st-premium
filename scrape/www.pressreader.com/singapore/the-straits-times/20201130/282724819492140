    <p>Money FM 89.3 ra­dio pre­sen­ter</p>
    <p>She has close to 20 years of ex­pe­ri­ence in ra­dio host­ing.</p>
    <p>I was from: CHIJ Sec­ondary (Toa Payoh, 1988 to 1991).</p>
    <p>My best school mem­o­ries: “Track and field was my pas­sion and I was the school sports cap­tain in Sec­ondary 4.</p>
    <p>“That year, at our sports day,</p>
    <p>I just felt the need to win ev­ery sin­gle race that I took part in and I did – all five of them. It was good fun.</p>
    <p>“You know, you have so much en­ergy when you’re in sec­ondary school. For me, it went into athletics.”</p>
    <p>One key les­son I’ve learnt:</p>
    <p>“Part of my school motto says ‘stead­fast in duty’ and that has al­ways stuck with me. I feel that you can make any­thing of your­self if you’re dili­gent enough and un­wa­ver­ing in your ef­fort.”</p>
    <p>If I were a stu­dent again: “I’d say: For­get about boys, you’ll meet a great guy later on in your life. For now, just fo­cus on lov­ing your­self.”</p>
