    <p>•</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump rou­tinely re­ferred to black lead­ers of for­eign na­tions with racist in­sults. He had an abid­ing ad­mi­ra­tion for Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin’s will­ing­ness to treat Rus­sia like a per­sonal busi­ness. And he was con­sumed with ha­tred for for­mer Amer­i­can pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>Those are the de­scrip­tions that Michael Co­hen, a for­mer per­sonal lawyer and self-de­scribed fixer for Mr Trump, lays out in his book Dis­loyal: A Me­moir, which paints the Pres­i­dent as a sor­did, mob-like fig­ure will­ing to en­gage in un­der­hand tac­tics against any­one op­pos­ing him.</p>
    <p>“As a rule, Trump ex­pressed low opin­ions of all black folks, from mu­sic to cul­ture and pol­i­tics,” Co­hen writes in the book, to be re­leased to­day.</p>
    <p>He says Mr Trump called Mr Nel­son Man­dela, who led the eman­ci­pa­tion of South Africa from white mi­nor­ity rule, “no leader”.</p>
    <p>“Tell me one coun­try run by a black per­son that isn’t a s***hole,” Co­hen quotes Mr Trump as say­ing.</p>
    <p>He also al­leges that Mr Trump called Mr Kwame Jack­son, a black con­tes­tant on his re­al­ity TV show The Ap­pren­tice, a ho­mo­pho­bic slur, and that he had deep dis­gust for black lead­ers in ad­di­tion to celebri­ties and sports fig­ures.</p>
    <p>He was ob­sessed with Mr Obama, his pre­de­ces­sor, Co­hen writes.</p>
    <p>The book de­scribes Mr Trump hir­ing “a Faux-Bama, or fake Obama, to record a video where Trump rit­u­al­is­ti­cally be­lit­tled the first black pres­i­dent and then fired him, a kind of fan­tasy ful­fil­ment that it was hard to imag­ine any adult would spend se­ri­ous money liv­ing out – un­til he did the func­tional equiv­a­lent in the real world”.</p>
    <p>The video ap­pears to be a record­ing that was sup­posed to be shown on the first night of the Repub­li­can</p>
    <p>Na­tional Con­ven­tion in 2012, when Mr Trump had en­dorsed the party’s pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee, Mr Mitt Rom­ney, and in­sisted on hav­ing time dur­ing the pro­gram­ming.</p>
    <p>Among the rev­e­la­tions from Co­hen, who worked for Mr Trump for more than a decade, are de­scrip­tions of the ne­go­ti­a­tions dur­ing the 2016 cam­paign with a key of­fi­cial at the Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion about how to pay off an adult-film ac­tress who said she had an af­fair with Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Co­hen also ex­plains in de­tail how The Na­tional En­quirer be­came a weapon work­ing in tan­dem with Mr Trump to dam­age the busi­ness­man’s op­po­nents in the 2016 Repub­li­can pri­maries.</p>
    <p>Asked about the many claims in the book, which The New York Times ob­tained an ad­vance copy of, White House press sec­re­tary Kayleigh McE­nany was dis­mis­sive.</p>
    <p>“Michael Co­hen is a dis­graced felon and dis­barred lawyer who lied to Congress,” she said in a state­ment. “He has lost all cred­i­bil­ity, and it’s un­sur­pris­ing to see his lat­est at­tempt to profit off of lies.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion did not re­spond to an email seek­ing com­ment.</p>
    <p>In Co­hen’s telling, his lies were on be­half of Mr Trump, whether it was in in­ves­ti­ga­tions or in try­ing to win him good head­lines.</p>
    <p>Co­hen pleaded guilty in 2018 to a hand­ful of fi­nan­cial crimes and a cam­paign fi­nance vi­o­la­tion re­lated to the pay­ments to for­mer adult­film ac­tress Stephanie Clif­ford, who went by the stage name Stormy Daniels.</p>
    <p>Co­hen is de­fi­ant about those ac­tions in the book, main­tain­ing that he is in­no­cent of some of the crimes he pleaded guilty to and that he was a vic­tim of “the con­vic­tion ma­chine” of the US gov­ern­ment, which also threat­ened his wife.</p>
    <p>He writes in de­tail about how he was re­leased from a min­i­mum se­cu­rity prison in Otisville, New York, to serve the rest of his sen­tence at home, only to be thrown back in prison be­cause he would not ini­tially sign a doc­u­ment pro­hibit­ing him from pub­lish­ing the book.</p>
    <p>A judge later ruled that the move by the gov­ern­ment was re­tal­ia­tory, and Co­hen was re­leased to home con­fine­ment for the re­main­der of his sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Co­hen de­scribes the Trump Or­gan­i­sa­tion as loosely rem­i­nis­cent of the mafia, with Mr Trump as the would-be fam­ily don.</p>
    <p>“As I’ve been say­ing since the be­gin­ning, Trump was a mob­ster, plain and sim­ple,” Co­hen writes when de­scrib­ing how he helped co­or­di­nate a soft­ball in­ter­view be­tween Ms Megyn Kelly, then of Fox News, and Mr Trump af­ter the can­di­date had spent days at­tack­ing her and creat­ing a se­cu­rity risk for her.</p>
    <p>As I’ve been say­ing since the be­gin­ning, Trump was a mob­ster, plain and sim­ple.</p>
