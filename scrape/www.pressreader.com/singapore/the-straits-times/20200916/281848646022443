    <p>Ja­pan’s in­com­ing prime min­is­ter, Mr Yoshi­hide Suga, is likely to stay the course that his pre­de­ces­sor, Mr Shinzo Abe, took for the coun­try, which is sad­dled with a host of for­mi­da­ble prob­lems.</p>
    <p>He has promised to keep what has seem­ingly worked, mainly the Abe­nomics mix of fis­cal stim­u­lus, mon­e­tary eas­ing and struc­tural re­forms which reg­is­tered nascent suc­cess, al­though gains have been wiped out by a re­ces­sion caused by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>But ques­tions re­main on how Mr Suga will ad­vance Abe­nomics in the ar­eas it has not worked. The inflation tar­get of 2 per cent re­mains elu­sive, as is a re­turn to fis­cal health with Ja­pan run­ning a debt-to-gross domestic prod­uct ra­tio of 200 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics have also said that those caught in the middle-in­come trap and those liv­ing in ru­ral re­gions have not felt the ben­e­fits of Abe­nomics.</p>
    <p>And then there are a host of other peren­nial is­sues: a rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion, low fer­til­ity rate, and in­sti­tu­tional gen­der bias de­spite Mr Abe’s pledge to cre­ate “a so­ci­ety in which women can shine”.</p>
    <p>Geopo­lit­i­cally, re­gional ten­sions are ris­ing, mostly blamed on Chi­nese mil­i­tary ex­pan­sion­ism, while ties with South Korea re­main cool. A break­through with North Korea over the ab­duc­tions is­sue re­mains elu­sive, as is a res­o­lu­tion to a ter­ri­to­rial dis­pute with</p>
    <p>Rus­sia which lies be­hind the fact that Tokyo and Moscow have not signed a peace treaty for</p>
    <p>World War II.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, who steps up as prime min­is­ter to­day, has yet to elu­ci­date how he in­tends to re­solve such long-term is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ms Shi­hoko Goto, deputy di­rec­tor at the Wil­son Cen­tre’s Asia Pro­gramme, said: “De­spite be­ing prime min­is­ter for nearly eight years, Abe was un­able to re­solve those key is­sues, and yet Suga is seen as a leader who would stay the course in im­ple­ment­ing Abe’s eco­nomic as well as for­eign pol­icy di­rec­tives.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, how­ever, has taken aim at the domestic bu­reau­cracy. He wants to cre­ate a dig­i­tal agency to foster dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, so that peo­ple “can re­ceive gov­ern­ment ser­vices 24 hours a day, seven days a week”.</p>
    <p>For the first time, Ja­pan will have a dig­i­tal min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga has also vowed to dis­man­tle Ja­pan’s over­sized min­istries to re­duce re­dun­dan­cies and vested in­ter­ests, after Covid-19 ex­posed how dif­fer­ent agen­cies can­not work to­gether. He also wants to re­duce fees for switch­ing mo­bile phone car­ri­ers, cit­ing a lack of com­pe­ti­tion, and con­sol­i­date re­gional banks that are bleed­ing dry as their clien­tele dwin­dle due to a dwin­dling pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>De­spite pre­sent­ing him­self as a re­formist, the new leader is ex­pected to re­tain many peo­ple in his core team in both the Cab­i­net and in the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party.</p>
    <p>Mr Toshi­hiro Nikai, 81, was re­tained as LDP sec­re­tary-gen­eral yes­ter­day, while Mr Taro Aso, who turns 80 this Sun­day, will likely con­tinue as deputy prime min­is­ter and fi­nance min­is­ter in the new Cab­i­net to be un­veiled to­day.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese me­dia re­ported yes­ter­day that at least eight min­is­ters will keep their posts in Mr Suga’s Cab­i­net, which will have only two women.</p>
    <p>Sophia Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Koichi Nakano ob­served that un­like Mr Abe, Mr Suga has not placed ide­o­log­i­cal is­sues like con­sti­tu­tional re­vi­sion and de­fence at the cen­tre of his campaign.</p>
    <p>“Com­pared with Abe, Suga is less na­tion­al­is­tic or ide­o­log­i­cal, but more pro-busi­ness and neo-lib­eral,” Dr Nakano said. “Suga is go­ing to con­tinue the best he can to achieve Abe’s pol­icy di­rec­tions, but he’s not as emo­tion­ally in­vested to the same de­gree.”</p>
    <p>This could be why, he sug­gested, Mr Abe saw the need to ex­plic­itly state his pref­er­ence for Ja­pan to acquire first-strike ca­pa­bil­i­ties in one of his fi­nal acts of of­fice.</p>
    <p>“It’s a dead end. Suga has no per­sonal in­ter­est nor po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal to do bet­ter than Abe (on such is­sues),” Dr Nakano said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Yomi­uri daily called for more clar­ity on pol­icy is­sues in­clud­ing con­sti­tu­tional re­vi­sion. It said that Mr Suga, as a core mem­ber of Mr Abe’s team, was “par­tially re­spon­si­ble” for Ja­pan’s lack­adaisi­cal Covid-19 re­sponse.</p>
    <p>“Lead­ing a coun­try in­volves a heavy re­spon­si­bil­ity. In car­ry­ing out poli­cies, it is not enough to sim­ply call for pol­icy con­ti­nu­ity,” it said. “(Mr Suga’s) abil­ity to ac­cu­rately un­der­stand changes in in­ter­na­tional af­fairs and strate­gi­cally re­spond to them will be tested.”</p>
    <p>De­spite pre­sent­ing him­self as a re­formist, Mr Yoshi­hide Suga is ex­pected to re­tain many peo­ple in his core team in both the Cab­i­net and in the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party.</p>
