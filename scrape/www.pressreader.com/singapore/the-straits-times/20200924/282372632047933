    <p>TOKYO • Olympic ath­letes could face strict con­trols on their move­ments and re­peated coro­n­avirus tests un­der mea­sures dis­cussed yes­ter­day by a task force charged with find­ing ways to safely hold the post­poned Tokyo 2020 Games.</p>
    <p>With less than a year un­til the Olympics, or­gan­is­ers and Ja­panese of­fi­cials met for only the sec­ond time with a long list of pos­si­ble re­quire­ments on the agenda.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes may have to sub­mit a de­tailed plan of their ac­tiv­i­ties in ad­vance – and pledge to fol­low it – or save their where­abouts on a “map app”, ac­cord­ing to doc­u­ments pre­pared for the meet­ing, although those com­ing from abroad may not have to un­dergo the cur­rently man­dated two-week quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>They may also be re­quired to un­dergo fre­quent coro­n­avirus test­ing – in­clud­ing three days be­fore leav­ing home, an­other on ar­rival, and oth­ers dur­ing their stay.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese ath­letes and other par­tic­i­pants liv­ing in Ja­pan, such as vol­un­teers, will face the same re­quire­ments, but all par­ties will be al­lowed to train dur­ing any quar­an­tine pe­riod, if re­quired.</p>
    <p>“Tests are one of the most im­por­tant is­sues from the two per­spec­tives of se­cur­ing safety and a sense of se­cu­rity for ath­letes,” Tokyo 2020 chief ex­ec­u­tive Toshiro Muto told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“We’d like to cre­ate a sys­tem, or mech­a­nism, to con­tinue test­ing when they en­ter Ja­pan.”</p>
    <p>But he ad­mit­ted that en­sur­ing the re­li­a­bil­ity of pre-de­par­ture Covid-19 test­ing in ev­ery coun­try – and guar­an­tee­ing their ac­cu­racy – would be a chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Other safety re­stric­tions floated in the meet­ing in­cluded ath­letes avoid­ing pub­lic trans­port where pos­si­ble and also in­tro­duc­ing so­cial-dis­tanc­ing “pedes­trian traf­fic lanes” in venues and Olympic vil­lages. Com­mon spa­ces such as lob­bies, lounges and tra­di­tional hot spring baths might also be closed to re­duce so­cial con­tact.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers also pro­pose to limit travel within Ja­pan for ath­letes, who will be re­stricted to such places as towns host­ing national del­e­ga­tions and train­ing sites.</p>
    <p>When asked how the rules would be en­forced, Muto said it de­pended on which re­stric­tions would ul­ti­mately be im­posed.</p>
    <p>He also ex­pressed hope that de­lib­er­a­tions with the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee, and other stake­hold­ers and var­i­ous in­ter­na­tional sports fed­er­a­tions would be fi­nalised by De­cem­ber, giv­ing or­gan­is­ers around seven months to im­ple­ment the plans be­fore the July 23 start.</p>
    <p>The post­pone­ment of the Games has caused all man­ner of lo­gis­ti­cal headaches, forc­ing the rene­go­ti­a­tion of con­tracts with venues and ho­tels, and ef­forts to keep spon­sors on board for an­other year.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic, which has in­fected more than 31.7 mil­lion peo­ple and killed about 975,000 world­wide, has also prompted hard ques­tions about the vi­a­bil­ity of next year’s Games, even as new Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga has em­pha­sised their im­por­tance.</p>
