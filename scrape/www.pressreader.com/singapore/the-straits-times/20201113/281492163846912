    <p>Asean has to en­sure an eq­ui­table, steady and af­ford­able sup­ply of Covid-19 vac­cines for its peo­ple once these are avail­able, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He made the call for “vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism” at the 37th Asean Sum­mit, as he stressed the im­por­tance of re­gional co­op­er­a­tion to mit­i­gate the pan­demic’s long-term im­pact. The lead­ers met re­motely this year.</p>
    <p>He added that Sin­ga­pore supports global vac­cine ini­tia­tives such as the Covid-19 Vac­cine Global Ac­cess (Co­vax) Fa­cil­ity, whose mem­bers in­clude many Asean na­tions.</p>
    <p>“Many lead­ing vac­cine can­di­dates are be­ing de­vel­oped by our ex­ter­nal part­ners, as well as our Asean mem­ber states too,” said PM Lee. “We should work with them to fa­cil­i­tate the pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines to</p>
    <p>meet the needs of our re­gion.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will con­trib­ute US$100,000 (S$134,900) to the Covid-19 Asean Re­sponse Fund, which helps mem­ber states pro­cure the med­i­cal sup­plies and equip­ment needed to com­bat the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On the eco­nomic front, lead­ers should re­dou­ble ef­forts to en­hance Asean’s com­pet­i­tive­ness in a post-Covid-19 world, PM Lee added.</p>
    <p>He noted there are ex­ist­ing frame­works that can be built on, such as the Mas­ter Plan on Asean Con­nec­tiv­ity 2025 and the Asean Smart Cities Net­work. In ad­di­tion, the re­cently launched Asean Cus­toms</p>
    <p>Tran­sit Sys­tem helps fa­cil­i­tate the cross-bor­der flow of goods. “These ini­tia­tives can catal­yse our re­cov­ery, and let us make full use of tech­nol­ogy as we ad­just to new ways of liv­ing and do­ing busi­ness in the post-Covid world,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter said Asean has made progress in var­i­ous ar­eas, in­clud­ing the mid-term re­views of the Asean Com­mu­nity Blueprints. It has started de­vel­op­ing the Asean Com­mu­nity’s post-2025 vision, and is ex­pected to sign the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship deal on Sun­day fol­low­ing years of ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>But one chal­lenge ahead will be that great power ri­valry is not ab­sent in South-east Asia, with ten­sions be­tween the United States and China putting the re­gion un­der greater stress and test­ing Asean cen­tral­ity and unity, PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>Even so, Asean can make a mod­est con­tri­bu­tion to­wards bet­ter mu­tual trust and co­op­er­a­tion among the ma­jor pow­ers.</p>
    <p>“Our re­gional ar­chi­tec­ture is open and in­clu­sive by de­sign, with Asean at its cen­tre,” PM Lee said. “We must re­tain our value propo­si­tion of of­fer­ing a neu­tral plat­form for coun­tries to work to­gether on re­gional and global chal­lenges such as counter-ter­ror­ism, cy­ber se­cu­rity and trans­bound­ary haze pol­lu­tion.”</p>
    <p>The Asean lead­ers at­tended four an­nual sum­mits with their key part­ners – Chi­nese Pre­mier Li Ke­qiang, Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, South Korean Pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Moon Jae-in and In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi – yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, with PM Lee speak­ing on the need for deep­en­ing eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion and con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween the re­gion and its part­ners.</p>
    <p>The Asean-Ja­pan Sum­mit also saw the launch of the Asean Cen­tre for Public Health Emer­gen­cies and Emerg­ing Dis­eases, which aims to strengthen the func­tions of na­tional health agen­cies and help pre­vent the spread of dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam’s Prime Min­is­ter Nguyen Xuan Phuc said the cen­tre and re­lated ef­forts will en­hance mem­bers’ joint ca­pac­ity to re­spond to med­i­cal emer­gen­cies and fu­ture epi­demic threats.</p>
    <p>Asean lead­ers also agreed to adopt an Asean travel cor­ri­dor ar­range­ment frame­work to fa­cil­i­tate the re­sump­tion of es­sen­tial travel in the re­gion, and have asked of­fi­cials to work on the de­tails.</p>
    <p>They also stressed the need to develop a com­mon set of pre-de­par­ture and post-ar­rival health and safety mea­sures to pro­tect peo­ple, and em­pha­sised that trav­ellers had to strictly abide by public health reg­u­la­tions of re­ceiv­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The cor­ri­dor is part of a wider Asean Com­pre­hen­sive Re­cov­ery Frame­work which lead­ers also en­dorsed. It out­lines ways for the re­gion to emerge stronger from the cri­sis, such as in­vest­ing in ed­u­ca­tion and reskilling, and en­hanc­ing dig­i­tal and fi­nan­cial in­clu­sion.</p>
