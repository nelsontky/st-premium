    <p>Zhou Yong­sheng China Daily, China</p>
    <p>Af­ter win­ning the in­tra-party elec­tion and be­com­ing the head of the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic</p>
    <p>Party (LDP) on Mon­day, Ja­pan’s Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga suc­ceeded Shinzo Abe as the coun­try’s prime min­is­ter on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>If Mr Suga suc­ceeds in sta­bil­is­ing the Ja­panese econ­omy and pol­i­tics, and con­tain the coro­n­avirus, as he has vowed to, he may be able to cre­ate a dif­fer­ent era of de­vel­op­ment in Ja­pan, rather than con­tin­u­ing to live in the shadow of Mr Abe.</p>
    <p>Although Mr Suga has vowed to fol­low Mr Abe’s poli­cies while mak­ing new achieve­ments, han­dling Ja­pan’s re­la­tions with China will be a big chal­lenge and an op­por­tu­nity for his ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the in­tra-party elec­tion, he said he would fol­low Mr Abe’s do­mes­tic and for­eign poli­cies. It means he might try to fur­ther im­prove re­la­tions with China but at the same time take a tough stance against China in de­fence and se­cu­rity poli­cies – for ex­am­ple, he may not ad­mit Ja­pan has a dis­pute with China over the Diaoyu Is­lands.</p>
    <p>No­tably, he has said that Tokyo-Wash­ing­ton re­la­tions will act as the axle of Ja­pan’s for­eign re­la­tions, while Ja­pan would main­tain a bal­ance be­tween its re­la­tions with China and the</p>
    <p>United States. In other words, Ja­pan will con­tinue to align with the US as far as in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions and se­cu­rity af­fairs are con­cerned, and con­tinue to back the US pol­icy of con­tain­ing China, es­pe­cially in the East and South China seas and take part in the US’ Indo-Pa­cific strat­egy.</p>
    <p>It is un­der th­ese pre­con­di­tions that Ja­pan will seek co­op­er­a­tion with China.</p>
    <p>Yet the Suga ad­min­is­tra­tion is ex­pected to con­tinue pro­mot­ing di­a­logue with China, par­tic­u­larly at the top lead­er­ship level.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga should con­tinue to con­sider invit­ing Chi­nese lead­ers to visit Ja­pan, as it would help im­prove bi­lat­eral ties and deepen mu­tual trust.</p>
    <p>Although the pan­demic re­mains a ma­jor source of un­cer­tainty for the eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tions in Ja­pan, Mr Suga might fol­low Mr Abe’s eco­nomic se­cu­rity strat­egy of en­cour­ag­ing Ja­panese en­ter­prises op­er­at­ing over­seas to “reshore”, or shift back to Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>If that hap­pens, China, as a ma­jor in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tion for Ja­pan, may bear the brunt of that change, es­pe­cially be­cause us­ing the Sino-US trade fric­tions as a pre­text, some Ja­panese en­ter­prises ac­tive in China may re­lo­cate their op­er­a­tions to Ja­pan dur­ing Mr Suga’s ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s ties with China are equally im­por­tant, if not more than, its ties with the US.</p>
    <p>For the sake of sound de­vel­op­ment of Sino-Ja­panese ties, Mr Suga needs to re­con­sider whether this agenda de­serves pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Hopes rest on Ja­pan’s recovery</p>
    <p>Editorial</p>
    <p>The Jakarta Post, In­done­sia The Ja­panese peo­ple are not the only ones who are pin­ning their hopes on newly elected Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga in the pro­longed fight against the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pan­demic and the eco­nomic stag­na­tion it has caused. The whole world, in­clud­ing 10-mem­ber Asean, hopes to see Mr Suga guide Ja­pan out of the health and eco­nomic crises, as Ja­pan’s recovery will help the ail­ing global econ­omy to re­gain its feet.</p>
    <p>The new prime min­is­ter is lit­tle known at the in­ter­na­tional level, be­cause as the right-hand man of for­mer prime min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, Mr Suga de­voted his time and en­ergy to do­mes­tic af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, as the lead gov­ern­ment spokesman, of­ten talked about ma­jor diplo­matic is­sues, es­pe­cially China, South and North Korea, as well as Ja­pan’s un­pre­dictable ties with the United States un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump.</p>
    <p>But many say he lacks vi­sion, com­pared with Mr Abe, who Mr Suga served for eight years as</p>
    <p>Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary. Now</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is needed to coun­ter­bal­ance the might of China, both in eco­nomic and diplo­matic terms, a role that has tra­di­tion­ally be­longed to the US.</p>
    <p>So, what can In­done­sia and Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo ex­pect from the new Ja­panese leader? No ma­jor changes are likely to hap­pen in In­done­sia-Ja­pan re­la­tions now that Mr Suga has as­sumed power.</p>
    <p>In fact, who­ever re­placed Mr</p>
    <p>Abe, Ja­pan would still con­sider In­done­sia a strate­gic part­ner es­pe­cially in the eco­nomic field, given the more than 1,600 Ja­panese com­pa­nies that are now op­er­at­ing in In­done­sia. The South-east Asian coun­try is one of Ja­pan’s largest mar­kets and a ma­jor sup­plier of nat­u­ral re­sources.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga will at least con­tinue the cur­rent poli­cies, though no more than his pre­de­ces­sor did.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor changes will only hap­pen if he wins the real bat­tle next Septem­ber.</p>
