    <p>March 21 - April 19</p>
    <p>You feel quite agree­able, so much so that you might just charm your way into a new ro­mance or job. Your en­ergy is a bit low-key, which is per­fect for this mis­sion.</p>
    <p>April 20 - May 20</p>
    <p>Profit is a driv­ing force and your en­ergy is so good, you may end up ahead of the com­pe­ti­tion with­out even try­ing. En­joy what you have and try to build on it to en­sure it lasts.</p>
    <p>May 21 - June 20</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ing comes eas­ily to you, though you may not be able to act on your new wis­dom right away. That is fine, as you should make sure your plans are firm be­fore pro­ceed­ing.</p>
    <p>June 21 - July 22</p>
    <p>You feel more re­cep­tive to new in­for­ma­tion, so pay care­ful at­ten­tion to what is com­ing your way. It is likely pos­i­tive, but you should steer clear of the other stuff.</p>
    <p>July 23 - Aug 22</p>
    <p>Ego prob­lems may flare up be­tween you and a friend or fam­ily mem­ber. Try not to take it all too se­ri­ously – you have to make sure you are both see­ing the big pic­ture in­stead of just feud­ing.</p>
    <p>Aug 23 - Sept 22</p>
    <p>You need to dig a lit­tle more deeply into what­ever is bug­ging you – it may be al­most any­thing. See if you can get your­self to lever­age your great en­ergy to make a new break­through.</p>
    <p>Sept 23 - Oct 22</p>
    <p>You and your peo­ple mesh al­most per­fectly, so let go and have fun. You may ac­quire a few new com­pan­ions along the way, so make sure you are open to all those around you.</p>
    <p>Oct 23 - Nov 21</p>
    <p>Things start to get re­ally crazy, so much so that you may have to in­ter­vene.</p>
    <p>Try not to make a scene, but you should see if you can get your peo­ple to calm down and face the real is­sue.</p>
    <p>Nov 22 - Dec 21</p>
    <p>Some­one needs to see your lighter side, so oblige him or her. You may not feel en­tirely up to clown­ing, but you can at least re­as­sure him or her you are feel­ing okay and want him or her in your life.</p>
    <p>Dec 22 - Jan 19</p>
    <p>Your thor­ough­ness guar­an­tees that things go your way, so get busy and make sure you are comb­ing over all the de­tails. Your great men­tal en­ergy helps you catch them all.</p>
    <p>Jan 20 - Feb 18</p>
    <p>You feel some­what strange, but that is noth­ing new. You just need to make sure you are fo­cus­ing on the is­sues that re­ally mat­ter, in­stead of try­ing to track down every stray de­tail.</p>
    <p>Feb 19 - March 20</p>
    <p>Write out your feel­ings – they are more im­por­tant than you re­alise and some­one close needs in­spi­ra­tion. That could mean you are fi­nally ready for the next step in a re­la­tion­ship.</p>
