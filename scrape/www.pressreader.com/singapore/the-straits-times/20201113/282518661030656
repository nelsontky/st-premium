    <p>Fifty-five storeys above the glit­ter­ing heart of the city, some­where in the con­crete and glass jun­gle of Ma­rina Bay Sands, the ul­tra-chic Wendy Long is swan­ning about in a strik­ingly sculp­tural Saint Lau­rent mini dress.</p>
    <p>The Ruinart is flow­ing, brandy cake is served on Gucci plat­ters, and the ex­tra lob­ster rolls she has overordere­d for the Harper’s Bazaar pho­tog­ra­phy crew – “I don’t know how to do things in mod­er­a­tion,” she ex­claims – sit on the kitchen coun­ters.</p>
    <p>This is Ms Long in de­fault mode – the host­ess with the ab­so­lute mostest.</p>
    <p>A style in­flu­encer and an avid Saint Lau­rent fan, the 39-year-old’s pas­sion for en­ter­tain­ing played a huge role in her in­te­rior de­sign de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been here for six years. I knew from the start that I wanted to en­ter­tain. That’s why there’s no TV in the liv­ing room. I wanted to max­imise the space and the seat­ing ar­range­ment,” she says.</p>
    <p>“It’s also why I fo­cused a lot more on the liv­ing and din­ing ar­eas, be­cause that’s what a home is to me: Hav­ing peo­ple over, and hav­ing friends and fam­ily to share it with.”</p>
    <p>Her liv­ing and din­ing ar­eas seam­lessly blend, united by soft grey-pan­elled walls and an­chored by sleek, mod­ernist fur­ni­ture: deep creamy couches, a bronze and leather arm­chair, side ta­bles stacked high with fash­ion and art books, a gar­gan­tuan mar­ble slab of a din­ing ta­ble.</p>
    <p>A lac­quered wood cre­denza sits to the side, hous­ing her ex­ten­sive col­lec­tion of Bac­carat crys­tal and Her­mes table­ware.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways loved in­te­ri­ors and do­ing up houses, and I like to bring in a bit of the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment – have syn­ergy be­tween the in­doors and out­doors,” she says.</p>
    <p>“So here in the heart of the CBD, right off the bat, I knew I wanted things to be very mod­ern, ur­ban, al­most mas­cu­line. I wanted a lot of leather, metal, con­crete. And I al­ways like a jux­ta­po­si­tion, so I went for these clas­si­cal framed wall pan­els – which I love and have in a few of my houses – and very mod­ern fur­ni­ture.”</p>
    <p>The rest of her home is equally chic (pieces from Chris­tian Li­ai­gre, Bot­tega Veneta and Minotti fill the house), but a lot more un­der­stated. “The pri­vate spa­ces are more about util­ity for me,” says Ms Long.</p>
    <p>Three of the apart­ment’s four rooms have been con­verted into a study for her hus­band, a read­ing room for her, and stor­age space for her over­flow­ing wardrobe.</p>
    <p>Saint Lau­rent pieces too vo­lu­mi­nous to fit into the clos­ets are strewn all over a bed in the last room. And that is be­fore her new-sea­son pur­chases have ar­rived.</p>
    <p>“I’m just dy­ing for the new Saint Lau­rent col­lec­tion to come in – I’ve pre-or­dered the la­tex leg­gings and the cropped bra tops.” While wait­ing, she bought sim­i­lar pieces from Jacque­mus and, sur­pris­ingly for her, a lot of ac­tivewear.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, I dis­cov­ered new sides to my­self I never thought pos­si­ble. I re­ally got into fit­ness. Be­fore this, I used to be so afraid of the sun, I would never go out in the day,” says Ms Long.</p>
    <p>She is now de­voted to Pi­lates, Gy­ro­tonic and walk­ing, and swears by Ernest Leoty. “I eat, breathe and live in those clothes. I love the brand’s jump­suits and I have them in ev­ery colour. It truly is a sta­ple; I don’t need to think about what to wear – I just pull out a one­sie and that’s it.”</p>
    <p>As much as she has em­braced her new nor­mal, Ms Long is hope­ful for a time when she can start en­ter­tain­ing again – some­thing she has prac­ti­cally re­fined into an art form.</p>
    <p>Her se­crets to a great din­ner party?</p>
    <p>“Music,” she says, “is very im­por­tant for set­ting the mood. I have a playlist for ev­ery­thing.”</p>
    <p>Her go-tos in­clude Neil Frances’s Music Sounds Bet­ter With You, Daft Punk’s Get Lucky, Nora En Pure’s Salt­wa­ter and The Ma­gi­cian’s remix of Lykke Li’s I Fol­low Rivers.</p>
    <p>“I pay at­ten­tion, too, to the guest list and the seat­ing ar­range­ment. I also love, love, love a good ta­ble set­ting. The wine selec­tion is im­por­tant as well and it’s not just about pair­ing wines to the food,” she says.</p>
    <p>“I love a theme. For my 10th wed­ding an­niver­sary, for in­stance, I in­sisted that all the wines be from our wed­ding year. And I al­ways have party favours – some­thing for the guests to take home.”</p>
    <p>For Ms Long, mas­ter­ing the art of en­ter­tain­ing is some­thing money can­not buy.</p>
    <p>“It’s not about serv­ing that 1982 Lafite or La­tour. It’s re­mem­ber­ing that this per­son prefers red to white, or that that per­son has a food al­lergy, so you don’t serve cer­tain things.</p>
    <p>“The devil re­ally is in the de­tails be­cause it means you’ve made an ef­fort and thought about the jour­ney of a guest diner from start to fin­ish.”</p>
    <p>This striv­ing for value be­yond a mon­e­tary one is why Ms Long re­mains so en­am­oured with the readyto-wear com­po­nent of fash­ion.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never been huge on ac­ces­sories,” she says. “A Hi­malayan croc­o­dile skin bag doesn’t say any­thing about taste or per­son­al­ity. It just says you have money. But for ready-to-wear, cer­tain things need a cer­tain physique, for ex­am­ple, which re­quires a cer­tain dis­ci­pline. It’s some­thing you have to work for and I ad­mire it when that some­thing is not based on wealth but on the in­di­vid­ual.”</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­al­ity is some­thing she has in spades and it is why her ev­ery de­ci­sion – from food to fash­ion to fur­ni­ture – is so sin­gu­larly stylish.</p>
    <p>I don’t know how to do things in mod­er­a­tion.</p>
