    <p>To­day’s Causes Week col­umn fo­cuses on three groups that help the el­derly. One char­ity has turned to vir­tual re­al­ity tech­nol­ogy to give se­niors a chance to ex­plore Sin­ga­pore, while an­other has set up a soup kitchen in Lit­tle In­dia to feed those in need. And a group of young peo­ple have launched a ser­vice that al­lows the pub­lic to send up­lift­ing greet­ings cards to the el­derly.</p>
    <p>The idea of do­ing some­thing for se­niors most at risk of so­cial iso­la­tion came dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod when six friends – equipped with so­cial me­dia, Net­flix and phones – got bored stay­ing at home.</p>
    <p>Ms Jaslyn Muk, an un­der­grad­u­ate, said: “We thought, ‘Why not en­cour­age peo­ple to send let­ters to each other and spread good vibes to en­dure the tough pe­riod?’</p>
    <p>“So­cial iso­la­tion among se­niors has al­ways been a con­cern in Sin­ga­pore, and with the Covid-19 pan­demic, its im­pact is far worse.”</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, vis­i­tors were barred from nurs­ing homes from April to June, af­ter Covid-19 cases were found at a nurs­ing home.</p>
    <p>In June, Hey, You Got Mail! was launched. For $2, mem­bers of the pub­lic can send a card made by vol­un­teers to a loved one.</p>
    <p>In re­turn, the group will send a card to a se­nior in a nurs­ing home or one who at­tends a se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tre to cheer them up and let them know they are not alone.</p>
    <p>The “100 per cent” non-profit ini­tia­tive chose greeting cards as se­niors be­long to the gen­er­a­tion who com­mu­ni­cated through cards and let­ters, it said.</p>
    <p>The project is the brain­child of Ms Muk, Ms Joanne Yep, Mr Tris­ton Tan, Mr Park Ji­won, Mr Ad­vait Desh­pande, all 20, and Ms Tan Wei Lin, 19.</p>
    <p>The six are ei­ther un­der­gradu</p>
    <p>ates or serv­ing na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>So far, the group has sent about 1,700 cards to se­niors with en­cour­ag­ing mes­sages in English, Chi­nese, Malay or Tamil. It also re­ceived some fund­ing from the os­car@sg fund from Te­masek Trust</p>
    <p>to kick-start the project.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, who is serv­ing na­tional ser­vice, said the se­niors en­joyed re­ceiv­ing the cards.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­mund Seah, so­cial work ex­ec­u­tive at the Ling Kwang Home For Se­nior Cit­i­zens, whose resi</p>
    <p>dents re­ceive th­ese cards, said: “For res­i­dents who are able to read, the con­tent of the cards, cu­rated in their na­tive lan­guage, adds a per­sonal touch.</p>
    <p>“For res­i­dents who are un­able to read, the cards were very well de</p>
    <p>signed and aes­thet­i­cally pleas­ing to the eye. Many res­i­dents keep the cards by their bed­side.”</p>
    <p>Read­ers can visit heyy­ougot mail.com to send a card to their loved ones</p>
