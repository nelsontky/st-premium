    <p>As the Covid-19 pan­demic wors­ened in March, Ah Boys To Men star Maxi Lim post­poned his wed­ding re­cep­tion, writ­ing on In­sta­gram that it was “the most so­cially re­spon­si­ble thing to do”.</p>
    <p>But when he and his wife, in­flu­encer Lizy Teo, who reg­is­tered their mar­riage in late March, fi­nally held the re­cep­tion at One De­gree 15 Ma­rina in Sen­tosa Cove on Sun­day, some at­ten­dees al­legedly threw cau­tion to the wind by ig­nor­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In videos and pho­tos of the event posted on so­cial me­dia, Mr Lim’s fel­low Ah Boys To Men cast mem­bers Char­lie Goh, Joshua Tan and Noah Yap, mas­ter of cer­e­monies Justin Mis­son and oth­ers, in­clud­ing in­flu­encer Ni­cole Choo and co­me­di­ans Fakkah Fuzz and Jai Kis­han, can be seen per­form­ing and play­ing games on­stage with­out wear­ing masks or face shields.</p>
    <p>Some guests at the re­cep­tion were also seen in­ter­min­gling and not wear­ing their masks dur­ing the march-in.</p>
    <p>A reader who tipped off The New Pa­per (TNP) on Tues­day said he made a com­plaint to the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) af­ter see­ing the posts.</p>
    <p>The reader, who is in his 30s and de­clined to be named, said: “I held my wed­ding re­cently and I am aware how the guide­lines may put a damper on the joy­ous oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, just like other cou­ples who got mar­ried dur­ing this pe­riod, we know the im­por­tance of these guide­lines, and many of us, with con­stant re­minders from the venue provider, fol­lowed (them).”</p>
    <p>He added: “To see a pub­lic fig­ure ig­nor­ing such guide­lines bla­tantly is dis­heart­en­ing. It is also ironic to see pub­lic fig­ures break­ing the rules when they had been ad­vo­cat­ing that the pub­lic ob­serve safe man­age­ment mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>STB di­rec­tor of ho­tel and sec­tor man­power Tan Yen Nee told TNP that the board is aware of the al­le­ga­tions and is in­ves­ti­gat­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­der cur­rent rules, wed­ding re­cep­tions can­not ex­ceed 100 peo­ple split across mul­ti­ple zones of up to 50 peo­ple each.</p>
    <p>Re­cep­tions with more than 20 at­ten­dees must be split into a des­ig­nated core wed­ding party of up to 20 peo­ple, in­clud­ing the bride and groom, and groups of up to five peo­ple for the re­main­ing guests. It is not clear which of the at­ten­dees at Mr Lim’s re­cep­tion were in the core wed­ding party.</p>
    <p>A safe dis­tance of at least 1m must be ob­served between groups and the wed­ding party at all times, in­clud­ing for photo-tak­ing.</p>
    <p>Live per­for­mances are not al­lowed, and masters of cer­e­monies and peo­ple mak­ing speeches are also re­quired to wear face shields or masks when speak­ing on­stage.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Tan: “STB... takes a se­ri­ous view of any breach in safe man­age­ment mea­sures within ho­tel premises... Strict en­force­ment ac­tion will be taken against er­rant busi­nesses or in­di­vid­u­als, which may in­clude fines, tem­po­rary clo­sure and pros­e­cu­tion to the full ex­tent of the law.”</p>
    <p>One De­gree 15 Ma­rina’s act­ing gen­eral man­ager Jonathan Sit said that be­fore any wed­ding, its oper­a­tions team will brief the cou­ple and wed­ding co­or­di­na­tors on the nec­es­sary mea­sures, and go through the pro­gramme to en­sure there are no games, singing or shout­ing.</p>
    <p>“Should there be breaches dur­ing the wed­ding, our staff and man­agers will im­me­di­ately tell the guests and even the wed­ding cou­ple to stay in their seats,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sit did not say whether the club had done this dur­ing Mr Lim’s wed­ding re­cep­tion, and did not di­rectly ad­dress queries on the al­leged breaches.</p>
    <p>He added: “As a venue op­er­a­tor, we share the same chal­lenges that gov­ern­ment-ap­pointed so­cial dis­tanc­ing of­fi­cers across the is­land face ev­ery day in do­ing their jobs, but we will con­tinue to carry out all these mea­sures that we have al­ready put in place.”</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported on Mon­day that One De­gree 15 Ma­rina was one of 10 ho­tels and hos­tels fined for breach­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim and other guests that TNP con­tacted did not re­spond to queries by press time.</p>
    <p>DIS­HEART­EN­ING BE­HAV­IOUR</p>
    <p>I held my wed­ding re­cently and I am aware how the guide­lines may put a damper on the joy­ous oc­ca­sion. How­ever, just like other cou­ples who got mar­ried dur­ing this pe­riod, we know the im­por­tance of these guide­lines, and many of us, with con­stant re­minders from the venue provider, fol­lowed (them)... To see a pub­lic fig­ure ig­nor­ing such guide­lines bla­tantly is dis­heart­en­ing. It is also ironic to see pub­lic fig­ures break­ing the rules when they had been ad­vo­cat­ing that the pub­lic ob­serve safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
