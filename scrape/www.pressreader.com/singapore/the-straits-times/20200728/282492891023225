    <p>Rebel Wil­son looks in the pink of health as the 40-year-old Aus­tralian ac­tress showed her In­sta­gram fol­low­ers the re­sults of her on­go­ing Year of Health un­der­tak­ing.</p>
    <p>The Pitch Per­fect ac­tress last Satur­day up­loaded a glow­ing pic­ture of her­self tak­ing a dip in a hot tub, sport­ing a lime green bikini top, shades and a cap.</p>
    <p>She has been shar­ing up­dates on so­cial me­dia of her on­go­ing fit­ness jour­ney in re­cent months, of­ten doc­u­ment­ing her var­i­ous work­outs, as well as her progress.</p>
    <p>Last Tues­day, she posted an In­sta­gram slideshow of her­self at the top of a cliff in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Dressed head to toe i n blue ath­leisure, Wil­son looked on top of the world, smil­ing proudly at reach­ing the sum­mit af­ter a hike.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, Wil­son said in an In­sta­gram post that weight loss was one of her res­o­lu­tions for the new decade. She said: “I’ll be hon­est with you guys, with my Year of Health mis­sion, I’m try­ing to get to 75kg.”</p>
    <p>She also shared a sec­ond goal she had with her fol­low­ers, say­ing that ca­reer wise, she was “try­ing to get one of my movies into pro­duc­tion be­fore the end of the year”.</p>
    <p>Wil­son says both goals re­quire daily ef­fort and are not with­out con­stant set­backs, but adds “even if you have to crawl to­wards your goals, keep go­ing”.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens have been sup­port­ive of her en­deav­ours, with one com­ment­ing: “You go, girl.”</p>
