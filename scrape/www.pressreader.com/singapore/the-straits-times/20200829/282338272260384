    <p>• The pace of wealth cre­ation in China just reached a whole new level.</p>
    <p>Just ask Con­tec Med­i­cal Sys­tems chair­man Hu Kun – shares of the in­stru­ments-maker surged more than ten­fold in its mar­ket de­but on Mon­day and recorded a 986 per cent jump through Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>That means the 49 per cent stake Mr Hu owns with his fa­ther took their com­bined for­tune to US$3.1 bil­lion (S$4.2 bil­lion) prac­ti­cally overnight, ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang Guili, a Con­tec direc­tor who owns 15 per cent of the com­pany, is now worth US$947 mil­lion, af­ter briefly hit­ting bil­lion­aire sta­tus ear­lier in the week.</p>
    <p>Of the two dozen or so com­pa­nies that de­buted in China this week, at least three pro­duced new bil­lion­aires as of Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>That may be­come even more com­mon as China seeks to lib­er­alise its cap­i­tal mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies on Shen­zhen’s ChiNext tech board no l onger have trad­ing lim­its dur­ing their first week, sim­i­lar to the oneyear-old Star board in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>The 18 firms that listed on ChiNext on Mon­day gained an av­er­age 212 per cent by the close.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings (IPO) have been an im­por­tant chan­nel for wealth cre­ation in China, and the coro­n­avirus out­break did not pre­vent the mar­ket from mint­ing new bil­lion­aires. At least 24 peo­ple joined the ex­clu­sive club in the first half of the year, in­clud­ing for­mer teach­ers, ac­coun­tants and soft­ware de­vel­op­ers.</p>
    <p>Con­tec sells products in­clud­ing oxime­ters, ul­tra­sound equip­ment and med­i­cal mon­i­tors to more than 130 coun­tries, in­clud­ing the United States, In­dia and Canada.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue climbed 6.8 per cent last year to 387 mil­lion yuan (S$77 mil­lion), with 73 per cent com­ing from abroad, ac­cord­ing to the com­pany’s prospec­tus.</p>
    <p>Mon­day’s IPO frenzy boosted other for­tunes, in­clud­ing that of</p>
    <p>Mr Steven Yang. The founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of phone-charger maker Anker In­no­va­tions Tech­nol­ogy is now worth US$3.7 bil­lion, mostly thanks to the ini­tial pop in the shares.</p>
    <p>He is a for­mer Google em­ployee who used his mother’s sav­ings to found Anker in 2011.</p>
    <p>“We are very happy that peo­ple are sort of vot­ing for us by buy­ing our stock,” Mr Yang said in a Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion in­ter­view on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>While the rest of the week was rel­a­tively quiet, Mr Dai Lizhong, whose Sansure Biotech started trad­ing yes­ter­day, has also be­come a bil­lion­aire.</p>
    <p>His 37 per cent stake in the firm is now worth US$1.1 bil­lion, based on the IPO price. A hand­ful of com­pa­nies were sched­uled to de­but in China yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>And with about 25 com­pa­nies in the IPO pipe­line for Shang­hai and Shen­zhen in the next two weeks, more peo­ple might be pop­ping cham­pagne corks soon.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings have been an im­por­tant chan­nel for wealth cre­ation in China, and the coro­n­avirus out­break did not pre­vent the mar­ket from mint­ing new bil­lion­aires. At least 24 peo­ple joined the ex­clu­sive club in the first half of the year, in­clud­ing for­mer teach­ers, ac­coun­tants and soft­ware de­vel­op­ers.</p>
