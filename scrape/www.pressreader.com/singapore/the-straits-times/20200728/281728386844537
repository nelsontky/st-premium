    <p>The Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) and di­ag­nos­tic cor­po­ra­tion MP Biomed­i­cals Asia Pa­cific have pro­duced a rapid an­ti­body test kit that can tell if some­one has been ex­posed to the coro­n­avirus within 15 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Called As­sure, the test kit de­tects an­ti­bod­ies known as IgG and IgM, which are pro­duced by the hu­man im­mune sys­tem af­ter it has been ex­posed to Sars-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment last Friday, the or­gan­i­sa­tions ex­plained that stud­ies have shown that lev­els of IgG and IgM ap­pear to be cor­re­lated with the sever­ity of Covid-19, mak­ing them good mark­ers of whether some­one has been in­fected be­fore.</p>
    <p>The kit uses spe­cially de­signed pro­teins, com­bined with tiny gold nanopar­ti­cles, which bind to the an­ti­bod­ies in blood, plasma or serum sam­ples taken from pa­tients.</p>
    <p>In a man­ner sim­i­lar to a preg­nancy test, if the an­ti­bod­ies are present, the re­sult­ing mol­e­cules will form a vis­i­ble line show­ing the test re­sult.</p>
    <p>While the test kit is not meant to di­ag­nose peo­ple with Covid-19, it can help to de­ter­mine whether an in­di­vid­ual has been pre­vi­ously ex­posed to the virus. This can help iden­tify asymp­to­matic in­di­vid­u­als or those with only mild symp­toms who did not un­dergo a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test.</p>
    <p>It is also a point-of-care test kit, which means pa­tients may be able to be tested and re­ceive their re­sults at clin­ics where the kit is de­ployed, with­out need­ing to wait for a lab to process them.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tions, which started de­vel­op­ing the kit in March, said As­sure was eval­u­ated by the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal’s Depart­ment of Lab­o­ra­tory Medicine, and demon­strated good re­sults for both serum and whole blood.</p>
    <p>The kit’s sen­si­tiv­ity was also com­pa­ra­ble with other com­mer­cial tests, and has been granted pro­vi­sional au­tho­ri­sa­tion by the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity for use here.</p>
    <p>MP Biomed­i­cals said it has started to ramp up the pro­duc­tion of the test kit here, and it is ready to be de­ployed at any time.</p>
    <p>It has also been dis­trib­uted to re­gions such as Europe, Africa and South Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>The cor­po­ra­tion’s se­nior re­search and de­vel­op­ment man­ager, Dr De­lynn Xu, said: “We are not the first one in the mar­ket, but chas­ing the best per­for­mance is al­ways our pri­mary goal. With this rapid an­ti­body test kit, we are proud to con­trib­ute to the global fight against Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>The chief ex­ec­u­tive of A*Star’s Di­ag­nos­tics De­vel­op­ment (DxD) Hub, Dr Sid­ney Yee, said: “This rapid sero­log­i­cal point-of-care test kit... will com­ple­ment global ef­forts to develop more ef­fi­cient di­ag­nos­tics as the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion con­tin­ues to evolve.”</p>
    <p>The kit uses spe­cially de­signed pro­teins, com­bined with tiny gold nanopar­ti­cles, which bind to the an­ti­bod­ies in blood, plasma or serum sam­ples taken from pa­tients.</p>
