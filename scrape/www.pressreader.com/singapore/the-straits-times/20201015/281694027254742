    <p>Since he was re­trenched from his sales job that drew a five-fig­ure monthly salary, Mr Tan has at­tended job fairs and sent out mul­ti­ple re­sumes.</p>
    <p>But the 50-year-old, who lives in a ter­race house, re­mains un­em­ployed and works as a Grab driver to make ends meet.</p>
    <p>He does not qual­ify for the Self-Em­ployed Per­son Income Re­lief Scheme (Sirs) be­cause of the type of home he lives in, said Mr Yip Hong Weng (Yio Chu Kang), who re­counted Mr Tan’s case in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I still re­mem­ber his part­ing words to me at MPS (Meet-the-peo­ple ses­sion): ‘I have been pay­ing taxes all my life be­fore this. Why is the Gov­ern­ment not help­ing me now?’” said Mr Yip, who was among sev­eral MPs who called for more help to be given to work­ers, in­clud­ing those who have been re­trenched or are un­em­ployed.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested that one way to help them is to boost their dig­i­tal pre­pared­ness, which the Gov­ern­ment can do by com­ing up with a pro­gramme to im­prove their dig­i­tal skills. “It can even be some­thing ba­sic like en­hanc­ing their on­line job search and com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills. This can be done, for ex­am­ple, via com­mu­nity classes to learn Ex­cel skills and how to use Zoom ef­fec­tively for team meet­ings,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Sak­tiandi Su­paat (Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC) wanted the Gov­ern­ment to let peo­ple tem­po­rar­ily with­draw up to $5,000 from their Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) sav­ings to pay for emer­gen­cies as their job loss wors­ens the state of their fi­nances.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing Aus­tralia, he said its work­ers who are hit hard by the eco­nomic fall­out from Covid-19 can with­draw up to A$10,000 (S$9,736) from their pen­sion plan.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore can im­ple­ment a sim­i­lar ar­range­ment, with a strin­gent el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria, he added.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, CPF mem­bers can take out a max­i­mum of $5,000 from their CPF sav­ings only upon turn­ing 55.</p>
    <p>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang), speak­ing up for mid-ca­reer PMETs, or pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians, said they face “tremen­dous pres­sure” to find a job swiftly to sup­port their fam­i­lies. For this rea­son, he said it is cru­cial to con­tinue sup­port­ing the SG United Jobs and Skills cen­tres, which were set up across all 24 HDB towns since July, to pro­vide ca­reer match­ing ser­vices for job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) pro­posed that the self-em­ployed who suf­fer income loss also be given Sirs, which means they can re­ceive three quar­terly cash pay­outs of $3,000 each, in May, July and Oc­to­ber. Not­ing that the last Sirs pay­out is to be made this month, Mr Ang urged the Gov­ern­ment to con­sider ex­tend­ing the scheme for six months, giv­ing vary­ing amounts for as long as the re­cip­i­ent needs help.</p>
    <p>The el­i­gi­ble sums could hinge, among other things, on the per­son’s past income or type of hous­ing, he sug­gested.</p>
    <p>He also wanted the Sirs cri­te­ria to be eased so that more peo­ple would qual­ify.</p>
    <p>An­other of Mr Ang’s sug­ges­tions was to let com­pa­nies that do bet­ter than in their pre-Covid days use the money they re­ceive from the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) to has­ten their ef­forts to transform their work­force or do­nate it to char­ity.</p>
    <p>Un­der the scheme, the Gov­ern­ment cur­rently co-pays up to 50 per cent of the salaries of lo­cal work­ers to help em­ploy­ers re­tain them.</p>
    <p>Mr Fahmi Ali­man (Ma­rine Pa­rade</p>
    <p>GRC) wanted the JSS to be ex­tended be­yond March next year for com­pa­nies in sec­tors se­verely bat­tered by Covid-19. Many of them em­ploy large num­bers of low-wage work­ers and might need the ex­tra help, he added.</p>
    <p>There is also room for the JSS to be bet­ter cal­i­brated to help those who need it more, Mr Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) said as he called for a re­view of the scheme.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Alvin Tan, speak­ing in this debate on how Sin­ga­pore can emerge stronger af­ter Covid-19, as­sured the House the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to work closely with work­ers, busi­nesses and in­dus­try part­ners to help them get through the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Jobs and liveli­hoods will be af­fected as Sin­ga­pore re­struc­tures its econ­omy, but he is con­fi­dent that by adapt­ing and trans­form­ing the coun­try’s work­ers and busi­nesses, it will be able to seize new op­por­tu­ni­ties and over­come the dif­fi­cul­ties, as it had done be­fore.</p>
    <p>“We have been through many ups and downs over the years, but we have al­ways bounced back from ad­ver­sity. We will con­tinue to press on with re­silience and over­come this chal­lenge to­gether,” he said.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat will re­spond to the con­cerns MPs raised in Par­lia­ment to­day.</p>
    <p>Our work­ers must keep an open mind and be nim­ble to cap­ture op­por­tu­ni­ties, in­clud­ing en­ter­ing sec­tors which may be new to them. The Gov­ern­ment will sup­port work­ers as they pick up new skills and pre­pare for new op­por­tu­ni­ties… At the same time, our busi­nesses must also do all they can to re­tain their work­ers, re­train them and treat them fairly. We will sup­port you as you do so.</p>
