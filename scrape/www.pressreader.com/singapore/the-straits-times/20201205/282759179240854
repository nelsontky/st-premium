    <p>Why are some of the plant’s leaf tips yel­low with brown spots? Also, the colour of the leaves looks lighter than that of sim­i­lar plants I see along the road and at nurs­eries. I live by the sea and the pot is on my bal­cony, which re­ceives al­most full sun­light all day. I wa­ter it once a day. Jo­ce­lyn Toh</p>
    <p>The com­mon names of your plant in­clude yew plum pine, Bud­dhist pine and fern pine. Its botan­i­cal name is Podocar­pus macro­phyl­lus. It is doc­u­mented to be some­what tol­er­ant to salt spray.</p>
    <p>How long has your plant been grown in its cur­rent pot? From the ap­pear­ance of the leaves, the plant seems to be suf­fer­ing from a nu­tri­ent de­fi­ciency. If a plant has been grown in the same pot for a long time, nu­tri­ents re­quired for healthy growth could have been ex­hausted and the soil prop­er­ties could have also changed, re­sult­ing in poor health of the plant.</p>
    <p>It could also be a case of fer­tiliser salt build­ing up over time and af­fect­ing the up­take of nu­tri­ents.</p>
    <p>Check your soil’s pH level to en­sure it is in the slightly acidic range, which is op­ti­mal for grow­ing this plant.</p>
    <p>If the plant has been grown in the same pot for a long time, you may want to move it into a larger pot with the root ball in­tact and back­fill it with a pot­ting me­dia that has qual­ity or­ganic mat­ter like com­post. Also, mulch the soil sur­face with com­post. Keep the root zone moist at all times.</p>
