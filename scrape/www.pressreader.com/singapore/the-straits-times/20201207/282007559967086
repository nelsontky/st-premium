    <p>A week-long drag­net to clamp down on crim­i­nal ac­tiv­i­ties in Gey­lang saw 89 peo­ple hauled up for var­i­ous of­fences.</p>
    <p>Among those nabbed were 62 men and 27 women, with the youngest be­ing 16, and the old­est, 94, the po­lice said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 16-year-old girl was ar­rested for of­fences un­der the Em­ploy­ment of For­eign Man­power Act, while the 94-year-old woman is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated un­der the Com­mon Gam­ing Houses Act.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers were ar­rested for of­fences rang­ing from the sale of il­licit med­i­ca­tion to breach­ing Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Over six days, from Tues­day to yes­ter­day, of­fi­cers from the Be­dok Po­lice Di­vi­sion led a multi-agency op­er­a­tion, with of­fi­cers comb­ing the streets of Gey­lang.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the raids, 20 men, aged be­tween 23 and 55, were caught for the sale of il­licit med­i­ca­tion, drug-re­lated of­fences and be­ing a mem­ber of a se­cret so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Four among this group, aged be­tween 25 and 39, are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for of­fences un­der the Health Prod­ucts Act. They had cough syrups, sex­ual en­hance­ment and other pills with a street value of more than $13,800 seized from them.</p>
    <p>The po­lice also came down on il­le­gal gam­bling, in­ves­ti­gat­ing 12 men and 15 women, aged be­tween 21 and 94, for of­fences un­der the Com­mon Gam­ing Houses Act. Cash amount­ing to more than $69,500 and gam­bling-re­lated para­pher­na­lia were seized.</p>
    <p>In one mas­sage es­tab­lish­ment, a 40-year-old woman was ar­rested for an of­fence un­der the Woman’s Char­ter. The out­let was found to be op­er­at­ing with­out a valid li­cence.</p>
    <p>The po­lice also found en­ter­tain­ment out­lets that were flout­ing Covid-19 mea­sures. They are in­ves­ti­gat­ing 24 men and 10 women for breach­ing public en­ter­tain­ment and liquor li­cence con­di­tions, as well as for op­er­at­ing dur­ing pro­hi­bi­tion and for fail­ing to com­ply with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>As part of the sweep of en­ter­tain­ment out­lets, one man and five women, aged be­tween 16 and 42, were also ar­rested for of­fences un­der the Em­ploy­ment of For­eign Man­power Act.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a 42-year-old man who had five car­tons and eight pack­ets of duty-un­paid cig­a­rettes was ar­rested un­der the Cus­toms Act. The duty and goods and ser­vices tax he evaded amounted to $540.</p>
    <p>An­other four men and one woman, aged be­tween 44 and 64, were is­sued with sum­monses un­der the En­vi­ron­men­tal Public Health Act for hawk­ing in a public place with­out a valid li­cence. They were selling sec­ond-hand goods, such as cloth­ing and shoes.</p>
    <p>The com­mand­ing of­fi­cer of Gey­lang Neigh­bour­hood Po­lice Cen­tre, Deputy Su­per­in­ten­dent of Po­lice Lee Ting Wei, said in a state­ment: “This op­er­a­tion is part of a multi-agency ef­fort to clamp down on crim­i­nal ac­tiv­i­ties in Gey­lang. I am grate­ful for the con­tin­ued sup­port of the var­i­ous en­force­ment agen­cies, which will go a long way to­wards keep­ing Gey­lang safe and or­derly.”</p>
    <p>The other agen­cies in­volved in­cluded the Cen­tral Nar­cotics Bureau and Sin­ga­pore Food Agency.</p>
