    <p>Zhang Guo­qing barely had time to set­tle into his new job as Com­mu­nist Party sec­re­tary of China’s Liaon­ing prov­ince in Septem­ber when he was con­fronted with his first big test – to bail out or not bail out the cash-strapped Huachen Au­to­mo­tive Group.</p>
    <p>Huachen, a state-owned en­ter­prise (SOE), not only makes lo­cally branded ve­hi­cles but is also in­volved in joint ventures with Ger­many’s BMW and France’s Re­nault. It was also in deep fi­nan­cial trou­ble, with a one-bil­lion yuan (S$204.3 mil­lion) bond due on Oct 23.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhang could have turned to the cen­tral gov­ern­ment for cash as­sis­tance or con­vinced state banks to cough up more money to plug the gap in Huachen’s ledger. In the end, he did nei­ther. Huachen de­faulted on the bond, cre­at­ing shock waves in the debt mar­ket. Huachen, whose lenders in­cluded scores of Chi­nese and for­eign banks and trust firms, was not alone in its woes.</p>
    <p>Its de­fault was soon fol­lowed by two other gov­ern­ment-backed com­pa­nies, Yongcheng Coal & Elec­tric­ity Hold­ing Group and Ts­inghua Un­i­group. The lat­ter, in a strate­gi­cally im­por­tant sec­tor, missed a Thurs­day dead­line to re­pay a US$450 mil­lion (S$600 mil­lion) eu­robond af­ter de­fault­ing on a 1.3 bil­lion yuan on­shore bond last month.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the num­bers, what caused a stir are the broader im­pli­ca­tions of th­ese missed pay­ments. Among the ques­tions be­ing asked are: How did it come to this? What has hap­pened to the long-held be­lief that state-backed com­pa­nies will be res­cued by the gov­ern­ment?</p>
    <p>RIS­ING DE­FAULTS</p>
    <p>Huachen and other SOEs are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing dif­fi­cul­ties at a time when the econ­omy is slow­ing un­der the twin pres­sures of a bruis­ing China-US trade war and the Covid-19 pan­demic. The pace of SOE de­faults rose sig­nif­i­cantly this year, with 10 state-owned is­suers de­fault­ing on 54 bil­lion yuan of bonds, or 42 per cent of to­tal de­faults, Caixin re­ported. In the past five years, non-pay­ment on 156.8 bil­lion yuan of bonds by 25 SOEs ac­counted for about one-third of the to­tal.</p>
    <p>Huachen still has 13 tranches of out­stand­ing bonds to­talling 16.2 bil­lion yuan, many of which will ma­ture over the next two years. Cred­i­tors have taken it to court to re­struc­ture it. The Shang­hai branch of DBS Bank (China), one of its cred­i­tors, is seek­ing ar­bi­tra­tion. Caught in this mael­strom, Mr Zhang is scram­bling to save Huachen from in­sol­vency through re­struc­tur­ing and try­ing to find new in­vestors.</p>
    <p>“Bankruptcy would be the last re­sort,” a Com­mu­nist Party in­sider told The Straits Times, re­quest­ing anonymity. Huachen em­ploys 47,000 peo­ple, and lay­offs could mean so­cial in­sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“The cen­tral gov­ern­ment is in a dilemma and mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion. It fears Huachen go­ing bank­rupt could have a domino ef­fect on other SOEs. But... what to do with all the other SOEs whose li­a­bil­i­ties ex­ceed as­sets?” the party in­sider added.</p>
    <p>Sav­ing Huachen will be no easy task for Mr Zhang or Liaon­ing. The rust-belt prov­ince’s tax rev­enues have been shrink­ing while its fis­cal deficit has been widen­ing, with dwin­dling land to sell.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors are in­ves­ti­gat­ing Huachen for any wrong­do­ing. De­spite hav­ing Ger­man and French car­mak­ers as part­ners, Huachen failed to lever­age for­eign tech­nol­ogy to de­velop com­pet­i­tive brands of its own. Some strate­gic mis­steps on the choice of mod­els hurt it badly and an ex­pan­sion into elec­tric ve­hi­cles, funded by debt, came too late, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters re­port.</p>
    <p>MED­DLING AND MIS­MAN­AGE­MENT</p>
    <p>Not all of the SOE prob­lems can be laid at the door of ex­ter­nal forces such as the coro­n­avirus-in­duced down­turn. Con­sider He­nan prov­ince’s Yongcheng Coal and Elec­tric­ity Hold­ing. An AAA-rated mine op­er­a­tor, it spooked the mar­ket when it failed to make prin­ci­pal and in­ter­est pay­ments on one bil­lion yuan in ma­tur­ing bonds on Nov 10, af­ter rais­ing a sim­i­lar amount through a debt is­sue weeks ear­lier. (To Yongcheng’s re­lief, bond­hold­ers unan­i­mously agreed on Nov 23 to a nine-month grace pe­riod.)</p>
    <p>Yongcheng’s plight can be traced to its par­ent, He­nan En­ergy and Chem­i­cal In­dus­try Group, says a Caixin re­port. The prov­ince’s largest state-owned com­pany by as­sets, He­nan En­ergy reg­u­larly trans­ferred funds from Yongcheng’s ac­counts and ex­panded its busi­ness from coal and chem­i­cals into fields such as trade, lo­gis­tics and fi­nance. Most of the par­ent com­pany’s 34 sub­sidiaries are money losers.</p>
    <p>Some an­a­lysts say China’s lo­cal gov­ern­ments also have to bear a share of the blame. Econ­o­mist Bo Zhuang from in­vest­ment firm TS Lom­bard said lo­cal of­fi­cials of­ten pres­sured SOEs to make ill-ad­vised ac­qui­si­tions. “The fastest way for of­fi­cials to get pro­moted is to boost the size of the lo­cal econ­omy, and an SOE merger, re­gard­less of its busi­ness logic, is a short­cut,” he told the Fi­nan­cial Times.</p>
    <p>Other ob­servers go fur­ther, as­sert­ing that strug­gling SOEs that can­not sur­vive with­out gov­ern­ment help should sim­ply be culled by mar­ket forces. “Let them die and don’t save them,” said Mr Wang Min, pres­i­dent of XCMG</p>
    <p>Group, China’s big­gest con­struc­tion ma­chin­ery busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Such culls are not un­known. In the late 1990s, then Premier Zhu Rongji took an axe to the bloated state sec­tor. While of­fi­cial fig­ures have never been re­vealed, his re­forms left mil­lions job­less. But SOEs are not col­lec­tively known as the “el­dest son” of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China for noth­ing. Given their long and close ties with the state, they con­tin­ued to en­joy priv­i­leges in ac­cess to funds and other re­sources that the pri­vate sec­tor lacked.</p>
    <p>What re­forms and merg­ers in the past two decades have done was to trans­form many cen­tral gov­ern­ment-con­trolled SOEs into gi­ants which at­tained mo­nop­oly sta­tus in their re­spec­tive in­dus­tries. Some of their sub­sidiaries have listed at home and abroad. But as can be seen from the lat­est trou­bles, the busi­ness of re­form­ing SOEs is a never-end­ing one.</p>
    <p>The spate of SOE bond de­faults comes amid the cen­tral gov­ern­ment’s drive to iden­tify and neu­tralise po­ten­tial sources of risk in the fi­nan­cial sys­tem.</p>
    <p>LIU HE’S WARN­ING</p>
    <p>In late Oc­to­ber, the Cab­i­net’s Fi­nan­cial Sta­bil­ity and Devel­op­ment Com­mit­tee headed by Vice-Premier Liu He is­sued a warn­ing: “All fi­nan­cial mess must be cleaned up with zero tol­er­ance for ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties.” In other words, SOEs and their lo­cal gov­ern­ment back­ers have been put on no­tice – it mat­ters not if you are big or small, old tech or cut­ting edge state cham­pi­ons, it is time to put your fi­nan­cial house in or­der.</p>
    <p>The big chal­lenge is how to im­pose fi­nan­cial dis­ci­pline and re­form SOEs while min­imis­ing the fall­out on banks and other sec­tors of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>While bond de­faults are un­pleas­ant shocks to the sys­tem, they are also ar­guably a nec­es­sary cor­rec­tive af­ter a record debt binge that has left China’s to­tal debt to GDP at over 300 per cent.</p>
    <p>At the same time, China looks to be strength­en­ing the state sec­tor by other means, the lat­est be­ing plans for a 70.7-bil­lion yuan fund to fa­cil­i­tate mixed own­er­ship of SOEs. The plan to draw in out­side in­vestors fol­lows the re­cent launch of a cam­paign to rein­vig­o­rate its state-run gi­ants, Caixin says. The con­cept of mixed-own­er­ship goes back to 2013, but is gain­ing trac­tion as China steps up ef­forts to wean SOEs off gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies and open more sec­tors to com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>In the brac­ing new en­vi­ron­ment, it looks like the gov­ern­ment has nei­ther the abil­ity nor the ap­petite to save all strug­gling SOEs. But as then Premier Zhu demon­strated decades ago, some­times a painful shake-up is needed to avert big­ger trou­bles ahead and get the econ­omy on a safer road to re­cov­ery.</p>
