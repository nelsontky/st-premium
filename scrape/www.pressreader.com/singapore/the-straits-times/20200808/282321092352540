    <p>• US em­ploy­ment growth slowed con­sid­er­ably in July, though not as badly as feared, amid a resur­gence in Covid-19 in­fec­tions, of­fer­ing the clear­est ev­i­dence yet that the econ­omy’s re­cov­ery from the re­ces­sion caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic was fal­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>Non-farm pay­rolls in­creased by 1.763 mil­lion jobs last month af­ter a record 4.791 mil­lion in June, the Labour Depart­ment said yes­ter­day. Econ­o­mists polled by Reuters had forecast an ad­di­tion of 1.6 mil­lion jobs in the econ­omy in July.</p>
    <p>The un­em­ploy­ment rate fell to 10.2 per cent from 11.1 per cent in June, but it has been bi­ased down­ward by peo­ple mis­clas­si­fy­ing them­selves as be­ing “em­ployed but ab­sent from work”. At least 31.3 mil­lion peo­ple were re­ceiv­ing un­em­ploy­ment cheques in mid-July.</p>
    <p>“The steam has gone out of the en­gine and the econ­omy is be­gin­ning to slow,” said fi­nance and eco­nom­ics pro­fes­sor Sung Won Sohn at Loy­ola Mary­mount Univer­sity. “The loss of mo­men­tum will con­tinue and my con­cern is that the com­bi­na­tion of the virus resur­gence and lack of ac­tion by Congress could re­ally push em­ploy­ment into neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory.”</p>
    <p>The labour mar­ket step-back is more bad news for Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who is lag­ging in opin­ion polls be­hind for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, the pre­sump­tive Demo­cratic Party nom­i­nee for the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>It also piles pres­sure on the White House and Congress to speed up ne­go­ti­a­tions on a sec­ond aid pack­age. Talks have been drag­ging over dif­fer­ences on ma­jor is­sues in­clud­ing the size of a gov­ern­ment ben­e­fit for tens of mil­lions of un­em­ployed.</p>
    <p>A US$600 (S$822) weekly un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fit sup­ple­ment ex­pired last Fri­day, while thou­sands of busi­nesses have burned through loans of­fered by the gov­ern­ment to help with wages. The econ­omy, which en­tered into re­ces­sion in Fe­bru­ary, suf­fered its big­gest blow since the Great De­pres­sion in the sec­ond quar­ter, with gross do­mes­tic prod­uct drop­ping at its steep­est pace in at least 73 years.</p>
    <p>Virus in­fec­tions soared across the coun­try last month, forc­ing the au­thor­i­ties in some of the worst-hit re­gions in the West and South to ei­ther shut down busi­nesses again or pause re­open­ings.</p>
