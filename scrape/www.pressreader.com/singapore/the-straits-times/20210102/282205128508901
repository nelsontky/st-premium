    <p>The Covid-19 cases in­volv­ing Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) crew mem­bers as well as work­ers in the marine sec­tor should alert us that a se­cond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in Sin­ga­pore is not too far-fetched if we do not pay heed to the global sit­u­a­tion: ris­ing numbers of in­fec­tions and deaths, and wor­ri­some mutations of the virus.</p>
    <p>As na­tions im­posed lock­downs over the fes­tive pe­riod and closed bor­ders to avoid new waves of in­fec­tion, par­tic­u­larly from any mu­tated forms of the virus, Sin­ga­pore should tread cau­tiously and be vig­i­lant in phase three of its re­open­ing, which will see greater public mo­bil­ity and eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The seem­ingly care­ful ob­ser­va­tion of safe man­age­ment mea­sures did not pre­vent the two SIA crew from get­ting the virus. Both had vis­ited Covid-19 hot spots – New York and Lon­don.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Lon­don has re­cently re­ported a new vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>All this should re­mind us of the fact that this virus is highly elu­sive and tricky to con­trol.</p>
    <p>There may be in­ci­dents of un­ex­pected con­tact with asymp­to­matic pa­tients, or mi­nor slips in pro­to­col not en­tirely due to care­less­ness.</p>
    <p>No one can guar­an­tee that the virus will not, through gaps in safe mea­sures, in­fect in­di­vid­u­als ex­posed to high-risk en­vi­ron­ments.</p>
    <p>While the vac­cines bring a ray of hope to ev­ery­one, this hope has yet to trans­late into full as­sur­ance of short- and long-term pro­tec­tion and safety for ev­ery­one. There are many un­knowns that only time will re­veal.</p>
    <p>There­fore, as the new year be­gins – hope­fully it will be a bet­ter and safer year ahead – let us tread with ex­treme cau­tion, mind­ful of the lurk­ing virus and the pos­si­bil­ity of new waves of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Let 2021 be wel­comed with guarded op­ti­mism and not with care­free aban­don­ment.</p>
    <p>No one can guar­an­tee that the virus will not, through gaps in safe mea­sures, in­fect in­di­vid­u­als ex­posed to high-risk en­vi­ron­ments.</p>
