    <p>United States pres­i­den­tial hope­ful Joe Bi­den’s de­ci­sion to have Ms Ka­mala Har­ris, the ju­nior se­na­tor from Cal­i­for­nia, as his run­ning mate in the Nov 3 elec­tion has elec­tri­fied the cam­paign and sent a fris­son around the world. The daugh­ter of im­mi­grants from Ja­maica and In­dia, she rose to at­ten­tion as the first woman, African Amer­i­can and Asian Amer­i­can to be at­tor­ney-gen­eral of Cal­i­for­nia, Amer­ica’s wealth­i­est state. Close to a gen­er­a­tion apart from her po­lit­i­cal boss, Mr Bi­den, who will be 78 years old if he suc­ceeds in win­ning the pres­i­dency, there is an even chance that she could end up in the White House even­tu­ally. Ms Har­ris, 55, is an ob­vi­ous lega­tee of Mr Barack Obama, the first black US pres­i­dent, as she ac­knowl­edged in a speech when she was picked to share the ticket.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment has added bal­last to the Demo­cratic ticket, which stands in con­trast to that of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who is ever mind­ful of his White Amer­ica base and is fre­quently ac­cused of be­ing misog­y­nis­tic. More im­por­tantly, the con­test this year is tak­ing place against the back­drop of the sharpest eco­nomic con­trac­tion in a cen­tury, brought on by the rav­ages of the yet-to-be con­tained coro­n­avirus pan­demic. The calm de­meanour that fronts a sharp in­tel­lect is a key part of the Har­ris equa­tion, as are the ra­cial di­ver­sity and ap­peal to women and younger vot­ers that she brings. Her own bid for the Demo­cratic nom­i­na­tion has left her bat­tle-tested. But weigh­ing against her is her record as a pros­e­cu­tor, which crit­ics say was marked by a pro­nounced tilt towards law en­force­ment at the ex­pense of civil rights. Ra­cial jus­tice and po­lice re­form in the US have come to the fore in Amer­ica’s po­lit­i­cal land­scape.</p>
    <p>The Asian side of her an­ces­try – her late mother was In­dian – adds a touch of cu­rios­ity to her per­son­al­ity. But Amer­i­cans will likely judge her on her record and in­stincts. She ticks many boxes: a child of the im­mi­grant dream and civil rights move­ment among them. Asian Amer­i­cans could prob­a­bly also find com­fort in that she is from Cal­i­for­nia, a pro­gres­sive state on the Asia-fac­ing Pa­cific coast and which is a melt­ing pot of eth­nic­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The con­test is by no means set­tled. The Bi­denHar­ris ticket will be tested by how much they are able to sway an al­ready-di­vided Amer­ica about the need for change to re­build the coun­try and to re­store US lead­er­ship in­ter­na­tion­ally. This is an im­por­tant week in the pres­i­den­tial race, with the Democrats set to for­mally en­dorse Mr Bi­den as their pick. Mr Trump re­mains a for­mi­da­ble force and is de­ter­mined to re­main in the spot­light. He will tour bat­tle­ground states, and just when Mr Bi­den is en­dorsed on Thurs­day, the in­cum­bent will be in Scran­ton, Penn­syl­va­nia – the town where Mr Bi­den grew up in. This fi­nal phase of the race for the White House has just be­come that much more cru­cial and interestin­g.</p>
