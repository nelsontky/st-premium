    <p>HONG KONG • The Hong Kong gov­ern­ment is con­sid­er­ing post­pon­ing up­com­ing leg­isla­tive elec­tions amid a re­cent surge in coro­n­avirus cases, me­dia re­ports said, prompt­ing crit­i­cism from pro-democ­racy can­di­dates hop­ing to tri­umph in the Septem­ber vote.</p>
    <p>Last night, news or­gan­i­sa­tion HK01 and broad­caster TVB cited sources as say­ing the Sept 6 leg­isla­tive elec­tions will be held in Septem­ber next year in­stead, and the gov­ern­ment is ex­pected to an­nounce the de­ci­sion soon.</p>
    <p>Asked why not post­pone the elec­tion for 14 days in­stead of a year, sources cited i n HK01’s re­port replied that the cost of holding an elec­tion is huge and the vote takes a long time to pre­pare – some­thing that can­not be done in 14 days.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Sec­tion 44 of the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil Or­di­nance, the chief ex­ec­u­tive may di­rect the post­pone­ment of a gen­eral elec­tion if the chief ex­ec­u­tive deems it is likely to be ob­structed or se­ri­ously af­fected by a riot, open vi­o­lence or any dan­ger to public health or safety. The elec­tion could be de­layed for no more than 14 days.</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam’s ad­vi­sory Ex­ec­u­tive Coun­cil was to meet yes­ter­day to dis­cuss post­pon­ing the elec­tions, the Hong Kong Eco­nomic Times re­ported, cit­ing peo­ple it did not iden­tify.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment spokesman told Bloomberg News: “The Con­sti­tu­tional and Main­land Af­fairs Bureau and the Reg­is­tra­tion and Elec­toral</p>
    <p>Of­fice are pre­par­ing for the elec­tion and shall closely keep in touch with the Food and Health Bureau and the Cen­tre for Health Pro­tec­tion to mon­i­tor the devel­op­ment of the epi­demic and for­mu­late var­i­ous plans.”</p>
    <p>The elec­tion would be Hong Kong’s first since China’s im­po­si­tion of na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion, a move that raised the pro-democ­racy camp’s con­cerns that it would be used to dis­qual­ify its can­di­dates from Septem­ber’s vote. The op­po­si­tion is hop­ing to ride the mo­men­tum of its land­slide vic­tory in last Novem­ber’s Dis­trict Coun­cil elec­tions to a ma­jor­ity in the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>“In­creas­ingly it’s look­ing chal­leng­ing to hold the elec­tion,” Mr Bernard Chan, the con­vener of the Ex­ec­u­tive Coun­cil and a top ad­viser to Mrs Lam, said in an in­ter­view on Mon­day. “It’s not like Septem­ber is go­ing to be any bet­ter. I just can’t imag­ine things will be bet­ter and not worse than now, so we have to pre­pare for the worst.”</p>
    <p>The re­port of a po­ten­tial de­lay comes af­ter more than half a mil­lion Hong Kong res­i­dents voted in the op­po­si­tion’s un­of­fi­cial pri­mary elec­tions ear­lier this month, de­fy­ing gov­ern­ment warn­ings and a rise in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>“Our bot­tom line is that we want to hold a safe elec­tion, an orderly, fair and just elec­tion, but the virus is re­ally an im­por­tant fac­tor that we can­not ne­glect,” Chief Sec­re­tary Matthew Che­ung, the city’s No. 2 of­fi­cial, said in re­sponse to a ques­tion on the elec­tion at a Mon­day brief­ing on virus mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Pro-democ­racy law­maker Eddie Chu tweeted that China wanted the de­lay in or­der to “avoid a po­ten­tial dev­as­tat­ing de­feat” and be­cause it was wor­ried about fur­ther US sanc­tions should prom­i­nent op­po­si­tion can­di­dates be dis­qual­i­fied.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivist Joshua Wong, one of sev­eral aspir­ing op­po­si­tion can­di­dates who have been queried by elec­toral of­fi­cers about past po­lit­i­cal state­ments, yes­ter­day ac­cused the gov­ern­ment of try­ing to sti­fle the city’s democ­racy by dis­qual­i­fy­ing democ­racy ad­vo­cates, or de­lay­ing or can­celling the vote.</p>
    <p>“Us­ing pan­demic as an ex­cuse to post­pone the elec­tion is def­i­nitely a lie,” he wrote in a Twit­ter post.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the Univer­sity of Hong Kong (HKU) yes­ter­day sacked vet­eran pro-democ­racy ac­tivist Benny Tai from his tenured position as an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of law, in a move he called “the end of aca­demic free­dom” in the city.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Tai was a lead­ing fig­ure in Hong Kong’s 2014 “Um­brella” protests, which paral­ysed the city for 79 days as demon­stra­tors oc­cu­pied main roads, de­mand­ing greater democ­racy.</p>
    <p>He was sen­tenced to 16 months in prison last year for two public nui­sance of­fences, but re­leased on bail pend­ing an appeal – a con­vic­tion which prompted HKU to be­gin re­view­ing his position more than half a year ago.</p>
    <p>VIRUS CON­CERNS VI­TAL</p>
    <p>Our bot­tom line is that we want to hold a safe elec­tion, an orderly, fair and just elec­tion, but the virus is re­ally an im­por­tant fac­tor that we ’’ can­not ne­glect.</p>
    <p>CHIEF SEC­RE­TARY MATTHEW CHE­UNG JUST AN EX­CUSE</p>
    <p>Us­ing pan­demic as an ex­cuse to post­pone the elec­tion is def­i­nitely a lie. But the govt knows only to in­ter­fere with the elec­tion that used to be free and fair, ei­ther dis­qual­i­fy­ing my can­di­dacy or to call off ’’ the elec­tion.</p>
