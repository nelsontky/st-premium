    <p>MI­LAN • The world’s first en­tirely vir­tual art mu­seum is set to open to­mor­row, hop­ing to bring mas­ter­pieces to any­one in the world with an In­ter­net con­nec­tion, ac­cord­ing to its Bri­tish cre­ator.</p>
    <p>The Vir­tual On­line Mu­seum of Art (Voma) will fea­ture art from renowned mu­se­ums such as the Musee d’Or­say in Paris and New York’s Metropoli­tan Mu­seum of Art, as well as dig­i­tal-only orig­i­nals, said Mr Stu­art Sem­ple, the artist be­hind the project.</p>
    <p>“The point of art is to com­mu­ni­cate and share ideas... (but) a lot of peo­ple can’t travel to a mu­seum,” said Mr Sem­ple, whose large-scale pub­lic projects have in­cluded re­leas­ing thou­sands of smi­ley-faced clouds over Lon­don, Moscow and Mi­lan.</p>
    <p>“This is a way to make it a lot more ac­ces­si­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic forced al­most all mu­se­ums around the world to close this year, with some re­open­ing for shorter hours to smaller num­bers of mask-wear­ing visi­tors while oth­ers may never re­open, par­tic­u­larly in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Ad­mis­sion to Voma – at voma.space – will be free, which its founders hope will help at­tract a di­verse au­di­ence at a time when many art­works are un­der scru­tiny for their links to slav­ery and colo­nial­ism with racial in­equal­ity in the spotlight glob­ally.</p>
    <p>“The art world is very much skewed to­wards the white viewer. That’s be­cause of the way the sys­tem has been op­er­at­ing,” said Voma cu­ra­tor Lee Cava­liere, a Lon­don-based art dealer.</p>
    <p>“It’s ba­si­cally New York, Lon­don, Paris and Hong Kong. So this is an op­por­tu­nity to break that open.”</p>
    <p>While vir­tual tours soared dur­ing lock­down, users of­ten feel they are look­ing at “loads of pho­to­graphs stitched together” rather than walk­ing through an art gallery – some­thing Voma aims to change, Mr Sem­ple said.</p>
    <p>The mu­seum is set within a dig­i­tal build­ing, which al­lows visi­tors to freely stroll through its grounds and gal­leries, take a close-up look at art us­ing high-res­o­lu­tion 3D im­agery, read re­views left by oth­ers and chat with friends, he said.</p>
    <p>Pur­pose-built soft­ware – de­vel­oped with in­put from ar­chi­tects, com­puter-gen­er­ated im­agery de­sign­ers and gam­ing ex­perts – aims to cre­ate an im­mer­sive and in­ter­ac­tive ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>On the out­side, sea­sons, weather and time change, af­fect­ing light on the in­side. So visi­tors could be see­ing the art on a cold rainy morn­ing or a starry sum­mer night.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant to root this ex­pe­ri­ence in the real world. I’ve seen dig­i­tal art ex­pe­ri­ences that haven’t worked be­cause they felt too dif­fuse and that’s slightly alien­at­ing,” said Mr Cava­liere.</p>
    <p>Run­ning a space that does not ac­tu­ally ex­ist of­fers ex­tra flex­i­bil­ity, he said, as staff can eas­ily add a room if needed and hous­ing a 10m-high sculp­ture is not a lo­gis­ti­cal night­mare.</p>
    <p>You can also burn the whole place down, as Kenyan-born mul­ti­me­dia artist Phoebe Boswell plans to do in her in­au­gu­ral dig­i­tal-first work for the mu­seum, added Mr Sem­ple.</p>
