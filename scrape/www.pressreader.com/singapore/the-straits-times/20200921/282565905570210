    <p>MADRID • Bri­tish street artist Banksy has lost a two-year trade­mark bat­tle with a greet­ings card firm over his Flower Thrower graf­fiti work af­ter Euro­pean Union (EU) of­fi­cials said his anonymity meant he could not be iden­ti­fied as the owner.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing con­cerns one of Banksy’s fa­mous ef­forts show­ing a masked pro­tester hurl­ing a bunch of flow­ers, which first ap­peared on a wall in Jerusalem in 2005.</p>
    <p>The mys­te­ri­ous artist, whose graf­fiti paint­ings have ap­peared overnight on build­ings around the world, ob­tained an EU trade­mark (EUTM) for the im­age in 2014.</p>
    <p>But two years ago, Full Colour Black, which makes greet­ings cards and wanted to use the i mage, claimed the trade­mark was taken out i n bad faith as he never in­tended to use it for goods or ser­vices – in a chal­lenge ac­cepted by the EU’s in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty czars.</p>
    <p>“It is clear that when (Banksy) filed the EUTM, he did not have any in­ten­tion of us­ing the sign to com­mer­cialise goods or pro­vide ser­vices,” the panel found, say­ing the artist’s anonymity had worked against him.</p>
