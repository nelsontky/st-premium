    <p>Ten months into the Covid-19 pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy re­mains de­pressed. More un­ortho­dox mea­sures may be needed to deal with a patchy, un­cer­tain eco­nomic re­cov­ery, says as­so­ciate editor Vikram Khanna (be­low).</p>
    <p>Ten months into the Covid-19 pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy re­mains de­pressed. The Gov­ern­ment has adopted ex­tra­or­di­nary mea­sures to deal with the cri­sis, and they have helped. But more may be needed, both to cush­ion the pain and to has­ten the re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>We have seen a turnaround from the lock­down-induced trough in the sec­ond quar­ter, when the econ­omy con­tracted by 13.3 per cent year on year. For Q3, the ad­vance es­ti­mates show sea­son­ally ad­justed quar­ter-on-quar­ter growth was 7.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>But this bounce should not be con­fused with a re­cov­ery. Be­sides com­ing off a low base, the fact is that Q3 gross do­mes­tic prod­uct con­tracted 7 per cent year on year. For 2020 as a whole, the Gov­ern­ment is stick­ing to its fore­cast of mi­nus 7 per cent to mi­nus 5 per cent growth. Most pri­vate economists’ es­ti­mates also fall within that range.</p>
    <p>AN ELU­SIVE RE­COV­ERY</p>
    <p>A sus­tained re­cov­ery re­mains elu­sive. The economies of most of Sin­ga­pore’s ma­jor trade part­ners are in deep re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Large parts of the Euro­pean Union, the United States and</p>
    <p>Bri­tain are fac­ing a resur­gence of Covid-19, while in Asia, Malaysia, In­done­sia and In­dia are still strug­gling to con­trol the pan­demic. All of th­ese coun­tries will have sub­stan­tially neg­a­tive growth this year, which trans­lates into de­pressed de­mand.</p>
    <p>In the re­gion, only China and Viet­nam are likely to reg­is­ter pos­i­tive growth this year, and that too, barely.</p>
    <p>In its October World Eco­nomic Outlook, the In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) projects eco­nomic con­trac­tions of 5.8 per cent in the ad­vanced economies,</p>
    <p>3.7 per cent in the Asean-5 (In­done­sia, Malaysia, the Philip­pines, Thai­land and Viet­nam) and 1.9 per cent growth in China. It projects that world trade will de­cline by 10 per cent. Th­ese num­bers do not au­gur well for Sin­ga­pore’s re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>On the bright side, the IMF fore­casts a fairly strong re­cov­ery next year: Growth will be 3.8 per cent in the ad­vanced economies, 6.2 per cent in Asean, and 8.2 per cent in China. But th­ese pro­jec­tions are sub­ject to down­side risks, such as fur­ther resur­gences of Covid-19 (which have al­ready hap­pened in the EU and the US) and de­lays in the avail­abil­ity of a vac­cine; it is no­table that the IMF’s fore­casts in October were sub­stan­tially re­vised from those it made in June. What is cer­tain though, is that for this year, the pic­ture is grim.</p>
    <p>On a sec­tor-wise ba­sis, the “re­cov­ery” looks de­cid­edly “K”-shaped. Some parts of the econ­omy are thriv­ing – even do­ing bet­ter than in the pre-Covid-19 era. Th­ese in­clude e-com­merce, do­mes­tic lo­gis­tics, IT ser­vices, su­per­mar­kets, semi­con­duc­tors and the biomed sec­tor. Some oth­ers are hold­ing their own, in­clud­ing fi­nance and in­surance, some non-elec­tronic seg­ments of man­u­fac­tur­ing and parts of the food sec­tor. But a few re­main deeply de­pressed, such as avi­a­tion, hos­pi­tal­ity, the ma­rine and off­shore sec­tor, con­struc­tion and smaller es­tab­lish­ments in off­line retail and the nightlife in­dus­try. Th­ese ac­count for the down­ward stroke of the “K”.</p>
    <p>Up to now, large parts of the econ­omy and job mar­ket have been par­tially propped up by the Gov­ern­ment’s mas­sive fis­cal sup­port, in par­tic­u­lar the wage sub­si­dies un­der the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS). The Gov­ern­ment es­ti­mates that the mea­sures could save 155,000 jobs this year and next, more than half of which will re­sult from the JSS. Even so, there were 11,350 re­trench­ments in the first half of the year, more than dur­ing the Sars out­break of 2003, but slightly fewer than the 12,760 lay­offs dur­ing the 2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>But we are nowhere close to the end. A mo­ment of truth will ar­rive when the JSS ends in March next year, which is when the lay­offs might start to ac­cel­er­ate as firms are forced to slash wage costs.</p>
    <p>Last week, the Na­tional Wages Coun­cil of­fered rec­om­men­da­tions on how em­ploy­ers can avoid, or at least de­lay, re­trench­ments – which should be a last re­sort – in­clud­ing through wage cuts. This was fol­lowed by guide­lines on how com­pa­nies can re­trench work­ers as hu­manely as pos­si­ble, a sig­nal that the Gov­ern­ment is an­tic­i­pat­ing more job losses.</p>
    <p>Higher un­em­ploy­ment thus seems in­evitable.</p>
    <p>So where do we go from here? Some job losses will be tran­si­tory. About 39 per cent of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents who were re­trenched in the first quar­ter had found new jobs by June. But as the lat­est Labour Mar­ket Sur­vey points out, the ra­tio of job va­can­cies to the num­ber of un­em­ployed fell (that is, there were fewer va­can­cies per un­em­ployed per­son) from 0.71 in March to 0.57 in June, which sug­gests that re­trench­ments out­paced va­can­cies dur­ing the pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead and es­pe­cially af­ter next March, re­trench­ments may in­crease even faster, lead­ing to more pro­longed pe­ri­ods of un­em­ploy­ment for some work­ers.</p>
    <p>By end-Au­gust, the Gov­ern­ment had cre­ated 117,000 work op­por­tu­ni­ties, ex­ceed­ing the 100,000 tar­get, but place­ments to­talled just over 33,000.</p>
    <p>Match­ing re­trenched work­ers to avail­able op­por­tu­ni­ties will con­tinue to pose chal­lenges. Many of the job losses will be con­cen­trated in sec­tors such as avi­a­tion, hos­pi­tal­ity, the nightlife busi­ness and other tourism-re­lated in­dus­tries as well as the ma­rine and off­shore sec­tor, which are quite dif­fer­ent from those that are ex­pand­ing and hir­ing, such as tech­nol­ogy, the med­i­cal sec­tor, fi­nance and in­surance, so­cial ser­vices and pub­lic ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Some jobs are portable, such as ac­count­ing, mar­ket­ing, sales and ad­min­is­tra­tive ser­vices, but most will re­quire train­ing, which will take time be­fore new em­ploy­ees can be pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>In this age of eas­ier re­mote work, some em­ploy­ers might out­source some of their work to pro­fes­sion­als on on­line job plat­forms such as Up­work, Fiverr and Free­lancer, rather than take on the bur­den of ex­tra fixed wage costs.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment is con­sid­er­ing ex­tend­ing sup­port be­yond this year for those who suf­fer job losses or pay cuts, as well as the self-em­ployed. While sup­port will be needed, the ques­tion is whether it will be the same as be­fore or more gen­er­ous, more au­to­matic and less con­di­tional, and how long it will last.</p>
    <p>There will also be sup­port for com­pa­nies, but the Gov­ern­ment has in­di­cated that this will be more nu­anced and se­lec­tive rather than broad-based, as in the JSS.</p>
    <p>This means bank­rupt­cies will rise. Some of th­ese will be among firms whose busi­ness mod­els have been ir­repara­bly dam­aged by Covid-19 and there­fore do not war­rant of­fi­cial sup­port, but there will also be un­de­serv­ing vic­tims of the pan­demic-induced re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>EQUITY STAKES</p>
    <p>While the Gov­ern­ment can­not, as it has said, save ev­ery firm or ev­ery job, it can in­ter­vene in the cor­po­rate sec­tor in ways that could make a pos­i­tive dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat has pledged to con­sider sup­port­ing firms whose po­ten­tial fail­ure could harm Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional in­ter­est. Te­masek’s crit­i­cal sup­port for Sin­ga­pore Air­lines ear­lier this year was an early step in this di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts spec­u­late that other po­ten­tial can­di­dates for sup­port could in­clude banks, tel­cos, ship­ping com­pa­nies and parts of the off­shore and ma­rine sec­tor.</p>
    <p>If cor­po­rate distress in­creases, the Gov­ern­ment could con­sider go­ing be­yond its stated goal to take equity stakes, via a spe­cial pur­pose fund, in se­lected, soundly man­aged com­pa­nies (in­clud­ing even some SMEs) whose prob­lems are clearly the re­sult of a tem­po­rary col­lapse in de­mand.</p>
    <p>If the bets are smart, the Gov­ern­ment (and by ex­ten­sion tax­pay­ers) could earn prof­its down the road.</p>
    <p>There are sev­eral ex­am­ples of gov­ern­ments tak­ing equity stakes in com­pa­nies dur­ing crises and com­ing out ahead. For in­stance, dur­ing the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 1998, the Hong Kong Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity bought up 11 per cent of the shares on the HK Stock Ex­change to avert a run on the HK dol­lar, and earned hand­some prof­its in the bar­gain.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Sept 11 ter­ror­ist at­tacks in 2001, the US gov­ern­ment took equity in Amer­ica West Air­lines and earned a 30 per cent re­turn. And dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, the US gov­ern­ment spent US$426 bil­lion (S$578 bil­lion) bail­ing out banks, in­sur­ers and car com­pa­nies, in which it took equity stakes. By end-2014, it ended up with a profit of US$15.4 bil­lion – not huge, but it saved tens of thou­sands of jobs and sta­bilised the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>In none of th­ese cases did the gov­ern­ments set out to make prof­its – they in­ter­vened for sys­temic rea­sons, but their ac­tions did not erode pub­lic fi­nances.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery cri­sis presents such op­por­tu­ni­ties for gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>While there are risks – not ev­ery in­vest­ment will turn a profit – there is a chance that over­all, the Gov­ern­ment will not lose if it bets wisely, and more im­por­tantly, will save many firms and jobs. Amid the Covid-19 cri­sis, this op­por­tu­nity should not be over­looked.</p>
    <p>EX­PAND­ING BOR­ROW­ING</p>
    <p>An­other un­ortho­dox pol­icy op­tion re­lates to bor­row­ing.</p>
    <p>With the econ­omy likely to re­main weak well into next year, the Gov­ern­ment will need ad­di­tional re­sources, both to con­tinue pro­vid­ing fis­cal sup­port, ex­pand so­cial safety nets and strengthen the ca­pa­bil­i­ties of work­ers and firms to cap­i­talise on the even­tual up­turn, which is also among its stated goals.</p>
    <p>Last week, Mr Heng said that with rev­enues “sub­dued and un­cer­tain”, the Gov­ern­ment is not rul­ing out fur­ther draw­downs of past re­serves over and above the $52 bil­lion al­ready drawn.</p>
    <p>But given the changed cir­cum­stances, both in the econ­omy and in the cap­i­tal mar­kets, it should also re-ex­am­ine its pol­icy to­wards bor­row­ing.</p>
    <p>So far, it has avoided bor­row­ing to fund re­cur­rent spend­ing, but is open to do­ing so for long-term in­fra­struc­ture projects. Such an ap­proach is con­sis­tent with the Gov­ern­ment’s com­mit­ment to balanc­ing its Bud­gets over each term and made sense in the old nor­mal of a cri­sis-free, grow­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But in the post-Covid-19 era, both the needs and the con­straints are very dif­fer­ent. In the face of large deficits, at­tempts to bal­ance the Bud­get, even over the term of the Gov­ern­ment, would be dif­fi­cult and might re­quire a pre­ma­ture with­drawal of fis­cal sup­port.</p>
    <p>Even the IMF, which has long been com­mit­ted to fis­cal pru­dence, ad­vises flex­i­bil­ity dur­ing this cri­sis. Its lat­est World Eco­nomic Outlook states: “Where fis­cal rules may con­strain ac­tion, tem­po­rary sus­pen­sion of the rules would be war­ranted, com­bined with a com­mit­ment to a grad­ual con­sol­i­da­tion path af­ter the cri­sis abates…”</p>
    <p>The World Bank’s chief econ­o­mist Car­men Rein­hart is more blunt, urg­ing fis­cally con­strained coun­tries to go ahead and bor­row big dur­ing the pan­demic. “First you worry about fight­ing the war, then you fig­ure out how to pay for it,” she said.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore may have suf­fi­cient re­serves to draw upon, this would come at the cost of for­go­ing in­vest­ment re­turns.</p>
    <p>Thus Sin­ga­pore should also con­sider the al­ter­na­tive op­tion of in­creas­ing its bor­row­ing sub­stan­tially. Given its AAA rat­ing, it will be able to bor­row at the low­est pos­si­ble rates. With in­ter­est rates close to zero and likely to re­main there till at least 2023, bor­row­ing would not im­pose a fis­cal bur­den if the econ­omy is able to grow at faster than zero.</p>
    <p>Even if it does not want to use the bor­row­ings to fund re­cur­rent spend­ing, the Gov­ern­ment could sim­ply in­vest the borrowed funds to earn pos­i­tive re­turns.</p>
    <p>As the Gov­ern­ment has said, an ex­tra­or­di­nary cri­sis calls for ex­tra­or­di­nary re­sponses. So far, it has de­liv­ered on this with its out­sized fis­cal pack­ages. But go­ing for­ward, it may need to adopt other un­ortho­dox ap­proaches to deal with the econ­omy’s patchy and un­cer­tain re­cov­ery.</p>
