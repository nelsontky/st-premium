    <p>Af­ter 26 years, the pop­u­lar get­away Bin­tan La­goon Re­sort is bid­ding vis­i­tors a fi­nal good­bye, a vic­tim of the Covid-19 pan­demic that has wreaked havoc on global travel and tourism.</p>
    <p>Mr Bu­ral­i­mar, head of the Bin­tan Tourism Of­fice, said de­clin­ing vis­i­tor num­bers and tourism re­ceipts were be­hind the demise of the 450-room, five-star re­sort.</p>
    <p>A July 31 re­port filed with the Bin­tan Re­gency Man­power Of­fice showed that 500 em­ploy­ees of the re­sort have been laid off.</p>
    <p>The re­sort is lo­cated about a 60-minute ferry ride from Sin­ga­pore, in Lagoi on Bin­tan Is­land, which is part of In­done­sia’s Riau Ar­chi­pel­ago.</p>
    <p>While the re­sort is shut­ter­ing for the last time, Mr Bu­ral­i­mar told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the rest of the re­sorts and ho­tels in the Lagoi area re­main in op­er­a­tion serv­ing do­mes­tic tourists.</p>
    <p>There are about 10 such es­tab­lish­ments, largely in the north of the is­land.</p>
    <p>Mr Bu­ral­i­mar, who goes by a sin­gle name, said: “There are no plans to re­hire or re­de­ploy the 500 work­ers who were laid off.</p>
    <p>“For now, the rest of the ho­tels cater to do­mes­tic tourists from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps, Bin­tan La­goon Re­sort was suf­fer­ing from hav­ing too many em­ploy­ees.”</p>
    <p>The is­land boasts golf cour­ses, na­ture trails and entertainm­ent out­lets, many con­nected to the dif­fer­ent re­sorts.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional events like the Bin­tan Iron­man, Bin­tan Triathlon and Tour de Bin­tan have been post­poned this year due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Tour de Bin­tan, a cy­cling event, usu­ally sees more than 1,500 in­ter­na­tional par­tic­i­pants and twice the num­ber of vis­i­tors to the is­land, said Mr Bu­ral­i­mar.</p>
    <p>From Ban­dar Ben­tan Te­lani ferry ter­mi­nal, vis­i­tors to the is­land take a short drive to their ho­tels, af­ter clear­ing se­cu­rity check­points.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ferry ter­mi­nal, ac­cus­tomed to a large in­flow of tourists, has gone silent due to travel re­stric­tions to In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The Jakarta Post re­ported last month that the pan­demic has wiped out close to US$6 bil­lion (S$8.2 bil­lion) of In­done­sia’s tourism rev­enue so far this year, while more than 95 per cent of work­ers in the tourism sec­tor have been fur­loughed with­out pay.</p>
    <p>Mr Bu­ral­i­mar said Sin­ga­pore­ans make up more than half of the vis­i­tors to the is­lands of Bin­tan and Batam, fol­lowed by Malaysians and Chi­nese tourists.</p>
    <p>With­out vis­i­tors, Bin­tan’s tourism in­dus­try has taken a beat­ing.</p>
    <p>“To date, roughly 14,000 em­ploy­ees (in the tourism in­dus­try) have been told to stop work as ho­tels scale down on man­power,” added Mr Bu­ral­i­mar. “We are help­ing some of those re­trenched with rice and food items. About 8,000 of them have re­ceived the one-time help.”</p>
    <p>While the out­look may seem dire, he is hope­ful that tourists would re­turn to the is­land soon.</p>
    <p>He said the au­thor­i­ties take safety and health pro­to­cols for Covid-19 as top pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Our re­sorts in Lagoi are iso­lated from the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion in Bin­tan,” said Mr Bu­ral­i­mar. “By fol­low­ing in­ter­na­tional health mea­sures and guide­lines, the like­li­hood of in­fec­tion is low. These re­sorts also have their own ferry ter­mi­nals, sep­a­rate from the ones used by the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>Still, the au­thor­i­ties in Bin­tan are not rush­ing to open its re­sorts to in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors as it awaits the re­sult of dis­cus­sions be­tween the Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sian govern­ments.</p>
    <p>“Our po­si­tion is the same as Sin­ga­pore – we con­sult our govern­ment agen­cies and de­pend on their find­ings,” said Mr Bu­ral­i­mar.</p>
    <p>“If there’s a les­son here, we need each other. Our liveli­hoods are all tied.”</p>
    <p>Bin­tan La­goon Re­sort did not re­spond to queries by press time.</p>
