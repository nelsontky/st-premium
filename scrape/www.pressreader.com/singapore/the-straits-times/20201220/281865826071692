    <p>Causes Week, which is into its ninth it­er­a­tion, runs this year from Dec 20 to 25. It shines a light on var­i­ous in­di­vid­u­als and groups, and shows how they are mak­ing a dif­fer­ence through their cho­sen causes within the com­mu­nity, for chil­dren and youth, and for the el­derly, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>A WAY TO GIVE BACK</p>
    <p>I wanted to do some­thing for the com­mu­nity once I re­cov­ered from Covid, and pass along some of the kind­ness I re­ceived dur­ing my time at the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>MS MAE TAN, who has re­cov­ered from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Two days af­ter she re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from a trip to the United States in March, Ms Mae Tan was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing her week-long re­cov­ery at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, Ms Tan’s thoughts went out to se­niors liv­ing in iso­la­tion and fear­ing ex­po­sure to the virus.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old, an ac­count man­ager in a fin­tech com­pany, later co­founded Kam­pung Kakis, a com­mu­nity ini­tia­tive to help con­nect needy se­niors with help­ful vol­un­teers in their neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to do some­thing for the com­mu­nity once I re­cov­ered from Covid, and pass along some of the kind­ness I re­ceived dur­ing my time at the hos­pi­tal,” said Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>It is now an is­land­wide pro­ject, rop­ing in about 1,000 vol­un­teers and reach­ing 400 ben­e­fi­ciary house­holds.</p>
    <p>“The plan was to re­duce the dis­tance that peo­ple would have to travel to vol­un­teer, which is why we are try­ing to gal­vanise neigh­bours to help one an­other and stay close to their homes,” said Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive helped 10-year-old Nu­rul Netrisya forge a strong bond with vol­un­teer Tracy Bay over the past five months.</p>
    <p>Nu­rul’s pa­ter­nal grand­mother, Madam Saeng­mai, 60, is her pri­mary care­giver as both her par­ents are ab­sent. They live in a two-room flat in Ang Mo Kio. Over the years, Madam Saeng­mai used her sav­ings and re­ceived sup­port from her lo­cal fam­ily ser­vice cen­tre to care for Nu­rul. Nu­rul, a Mayflower Pri­mary School pupil, also taps the Education Min­istry’s Fi­nan­cial As­sis­tance Scheme for her ed­u­ca­tional needs.</p>
    <p>A social worker ad­vised Madam Saeng­mai to con­tact Kam­pung Kakis and engage a vol­un­teer. In late June, they met Ms Bay, 41, who lives a few blocks away.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Bay: “I signed up on the</p>
    <p>Kam­pung Kaki web­site af­ter know­ing about (Ms Tan’s) story of sur­viv­ing Covid-19 and set­ting up the ini­tia­tive. I was in­spired by her spirit and wanted to know how I could help in the neigh­bour­hood.”</p>
    <p>The civil ser­vant helped Nu­rul with her school­work, guid­ing her through her weaker sub­jects. Nu­rul, who as­pires to be a doc­tor or a dancer one day, de­scribed Ms Bay as a kind and help­ful friend.</p>
    <p>Their meet­ings came to a halt when Madam Saeng­mai suf­fered a stroke on July 31.</p>
    <p>She was rushed off for treat­ment, un­der­went surgery and re­mained at Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal for a month. Dur­ing this time, Nu­rul stayed with other rel­a­tives, un­able to visit her grand­mother due to the safety re­stric­tions in place. Ms Bay tried to keep in touch with her vir­tu­ally dur­ing the dif­fi­cult time.</p>
    <p>Said Nu­rul: “Be­cause my grand­mother was at the hos­pi­tal, I could not fo­cus in school. When she came back from the hos­pi­tal, I cried a lot, I was so happy to see her.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the school hol­i­days, Nu­rul and Ms Bay have put the text­books aside and picked up gar­den­ing.</p>
    <p>When asked how the vol­un­teer­ing ex­pe­ri­ence has af­fected her, Ms Bay said: “When we live within our com­fort zones, it is dif­fi­cult to un­der­stand the lives of oth­ers around us. This ini­tia­tive has helped me break through that and widened my per­spec­tive.”</p>
