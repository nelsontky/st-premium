    <p>LE MANS • For­mula One’s gov­ern­ing body, the FIA (In­ter­na­tional Au­to­mo­bile Fed­er­a­tion), will do what it can to avoid a cal­en­dar clash next year be­tween the 24 Hours of Le Mans and a grand prix, pres­i­dent Jean Todt told re­porters at the 88th edi­tion of the event.</p>
    <p>This year’s F1 cal­en­dar had listed the Canadian Grand Prix on the same June week­end as Le Mans be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic tore up the sched­ules, with the Mon­treal race ul­ti­mately can­celled.</p>
    <p>Le Mans will be the high­light of a re­duced six-round World En­durance Cham­pi­onship (WEC) sea­son in 2021 with the race sched­uled for June 12-13 on a pro­vi­sional cal­en­dar pub­lished last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“Clearly, we will do as much as we can to avoid a clash be­tween WEC and For­mula One,” Todt said in a Zoom news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“But of course it can also de­pend where For­mula One will be lo­cated be­cause the time zone has some im­por­tance.</p>
    <p>“So we will do the best ef­fort but that’s the max­i­mum I can tell you.”</p>
    <p>For­mula One has yet to pub­lish a draft 2021 cal­en­dar but is hop­ing to have a more fa­mil­iar list of races af­ter a con­densed and re­duced 2020 sea­son. “We’re cer­tainly plan­ning on a 2021 that may not be com­pletely busi­ness back to nor­mal, but it’s pretty close,” chair­man Chase Carey told Sky Sports tele­vi­sion last month.</p>
    <p>This year was sup­posed to have a record 22 rounds but now has only 17, the ma­jor­ity of them in Europe, with some new cir­cuits brought in to re­place those whose grands prix had to be can­celled.</p>
    <p>For­mula One driv­ers have com­peted at Le Mans and grands prix in the same sea­son – Ger­many’s Nico Hulken­berg win­ning in 2015 and Fer­nando Alonso in 2018 while with Force In­dia and McLaren re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Hulken­berg was un­able to de­fend his ti­tle in 2016 as the race clashed with the in­au­gu­ral grand prix in Azer­bai­jan.</p>
    <p>Separately, Todt last week re­vealed that F1 great Michael Schu­macher was still fight­ing to over­come his dev­as­tat­ing in­juries from a ski ac­ci­dent seven years ago, and a renowned neu­ro­sur­geon has now of­fered an in­sight into the 51-yearold’s con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on a new doc­u­men­tary on French TV, Erich Riederer cast doubts over whether the Ger­man will ever be func­tional again.</p>
    <p>He told TMC: “I think he’s in a veg­e­ta­tive state, which means he’s awake but not re­spond­ing.</p>
    <p>“He is breath­ing, his heart is beat­ing, he can prob­a­bly sit up and take baby steps with help, but no more.</p>
    <p>“I think that’s the max­i­mum for him. Is there any chance of see­ing him like he was be­fore his ac­ci­dent? I re­ally don’t think so.”</p>
