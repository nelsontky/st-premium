    <p>Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary, Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion and Pub­lic Sec­tor Sci­ence & Tech­nol­ogy Pol­icy and Plans Of­fice; Chair­man, A*Star Mer­i­to­ri­ous Ser­vice Medal</p>
    <p>As a stu­dent, Ms Chan Lai Fung was dis­ap­pointed when she did not do as well at the O-level ex­am­i­na­tions as she had for her school ex­ams. At the time, it felt like “the end of the world”.</p>
    <p>But as it turned out, those grades did not mat­ter. Years later, she went on to be­come one of Sin­ga­pore’s top civil ser­vants.</p>
    <p>It was fit­ting then that as Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary for Ed­u­ca­tion from 2012 to 2019, she led ef­forts to shift the fo­cus away from grades and to broaden the def­i­ni­tion of suc­cess. Stream­ing is be­ing re­placed by sub­ject-based band­ing, al­low­ing stu­dents to take a sub­ject at a level based on their abil­ity. The PSLE scor­ing sys­tem was also re­vamped.</p>
    <p>Ms Chan, who has been in pub­lic ser­vice for over 30 years, also cham­pi­oned a sin­gle salary struc­ture for both grad­u­ate and non-grad­u­ate teach­ers. “Why do we in­sist on them jump­ing through hoops to com­plete their de­gree be­fore we put them on the same path­way? Ul­ti­mately, it must be skills and com­pe­ten­cies that mat­ter,” she said.</p>
    <p>Even now, the 56-year-old still of­fers her per­spec­tives when peo­ple bring up hot-but­ton top­ics on ed­u­ca­tion. “I think my (Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion) col­leagues are do­ing a won­der­ful job and it would be ter­ri­ble for their work to be mis­un­der­stood.”</p>
