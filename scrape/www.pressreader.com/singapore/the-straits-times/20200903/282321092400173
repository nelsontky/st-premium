    <p>The In­dian econ­omy, which con­tracted by 23.9 per cent in the first quar­ter of its fi­nan­cial year on the back of a strin­gent coro­n­avirus lock­down that led to job losses and drove down con­sump­tion, is in even big­ger trou­ble, as the lat­est growth fig­ures show.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, gov­ern­ment data re­vealed that the In­dian econ­omy is per­form­ing at its worst since 1996, when the coun­try first started pub­lish­ing quar­terly gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tional data for the first quar­ter ended June 30 re­vealed that man­u­fac­tur­ing had con­tracted by 39 per cent, con­struc­tion by</p>
    <p>50.3 per cent and the trade, ho­tel, trans­port and com­mu­ni­ca­tion seg­ments by 47 per cent.</p>
    <p>A rare pos­i­tive was agri­cul­ture, forestry and fish­ing, which inched up 0.4 per cent to 3.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to credit rat­ings agency Care Rat­ings, In­dia is be­hind only Peru and Ma­cau in ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the sever­est con­trac­tion out of the 54 ter­ri­to­ries that have re­ported GDP fig­ures for April to June.</p>
    <p>The pre­dic­tion by an­a­lysts is that In­dia, once seen as a global eco­nomic driver, will con­tinue to lag be­hind other economies.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank econ­o­mist Rad­hika</p>
    <p>Rao said: “Con­sump­tion weak­ness in the cur­rent cy­cle stems from weaker dis­pos­able in­comes and un­cer­tainty over em­ploy­ment prospects, rather than changes in the rate cy­cle.</p>
    <p>“This re­quires a larger fis­cal push, which car­ries a greater mul­ti­plier for growth but meets con­strained head­room due to anaemic rev­enue col­lec­tions.”</p>
    <p>She pre­dicts a stim­u­lus push later in the year which may in­clude a short-term boost for con­sump­tion, in­clud­ing cash trans­fers, and a medium-term push to­wards in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>In­dia was al­ready fac­ing head­winds, with growth touch­ing a six-year low of 4.7 per cent in the Oc­to­ber to December 2019 quar­ter.</p>
    <p>In March, the fed­eral gov­ern­ment im­posed a strin­gent coun­try­wide lock­down, bring­ing eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity to a com­plete halt. Hun­dreds of mi­grant work­ers lost their jobs, de­mand dropped and busi­nesses and in­dus­try were shut.</p>
    <p>It has since eased the lock­down in stages, with metro train ser­vices be­ing al­lowed to re­sume op­er­a­tions in the lat­est loos­en­ing of re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment had in March an­nounced a 1.7 tril­lion ru­pee (S$31.7 bil­lion) fi­nan­cial pack­age, in­volv­ing di­rect cash trans­fers and free food, and in May in­tro­duced a 20 tril­lion ru­pee eco­nomic pack­age, in­clud­ing col­lat­eral-free loans for small busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>But re­sump­tion of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity has been hit as state gov­ern­ments con­tinue to im­ple­ment mini-lock­downs to curb in­fec­tions within their bor­ders.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment, keen to push eco­nomic growth, has said state gov­ern­ments can­not im­pose lock­downs with­out fed­eral con­sent, even as In­dia re­mains among the three worst-hit coun­tries, with 3.77 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>Still, gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials re­main op­ti­mistic.</p>
    <p>Mr Kr­ish­na­murthy Subra­ma­nian, chief eco­nomic ad­viser to the In­dian gov­ern­ment, said the coun­try is see­ing a V-shaped re­cov­ery, in which the econ­omy goes through a brief pe­riod of eco­nomic de­cline fol­lowed by a strong re­cov­ery. “In­dia was in a lock­down all through the April to June quar­ter with the ma­jor­ity of eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties be­ing re­stricted. So this trend is along ex­pected lines,” he said in a state­ment on the slow­ing growth.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a re­port ti­tled City Of Dreams No More, pub­lished on Tues­day by the Lon­don School of Eco­nomics’ Cen­tre for Eco­nomic Per­for­mance, 52 per cent of ur­ban work­ers in In­dia went at least a month with­out work, pay or any fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance dur­ing the lock­down.</p>
    <p>The World Bank said the Covid-19 pan­demic is push­ing mil­lions of In­di­ans into poverty, with half of the pop­u­la­tion vul­ner­a­ble due to in­come and job losses.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Biswa­jit Dhar of Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity said all the growth driv­ers necessary for any kind of re­cov­ery in the en­su­ing quar­ters seem to be miss­ing. “You don’t have cus­tomer de­mand and then you don’t have in­vest­ment, which is fall­ing, and then ex­ports are de­pressed, ob­vi­ously, be­cause of the global sit­u­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>And many be­lieve that un­til In­dia gets the pan­demic un­der con­trol, eco­nomic re­cov­ery will re­main prob­lem­atic.</p>
    <p>In­dia last week re­ported 500,000 new Covid-19 cases, the most of any coun­try, said the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
