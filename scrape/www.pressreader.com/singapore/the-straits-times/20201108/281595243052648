    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s state­ment, after a num­ber of US me­dia out­lets said Mr Joe Bi­den had won the elec­tion</p>
    <p>We all know why Joe Bi­den is rush­ing to falsely pose as the win­ner, and why his me­dia al­lies are try­ing so hard to help him: they don’t want the truth to be ex­posed. The sim­ple fact is this elec­tion is far from over. Joe Bi­den has not been cer­ti­fied as the win­ner of any states, let alone any of the highly con­tested states headed for manda­tory re­counts, or states where our cam­paign has valid and le­git­i­mate le­gal chal­lenges that could de­ter­mine the ul­ti­mate vic­tor. In Penn­syl­va­nia, for ex­am­ple, our le­gal ob­servers were not per­mit­ted mean­ing­ful ac­cess to watch the count­ing process. Le­gal votes de­cide who is pres­i­dent, not the news me­dia.</p>
    <p>Be­gin­ning Mon­day, our cam­paign will start pros­e­cut­ing our case in court to en­sure elec­tion laws are fully up­held and the right­ful win­ner is seated. The Amer­i­can Peo­ple are en­ti­tled to an hon­est elec­tion: that means count­ing all le­gal bal­lots, and not count­ing any il­le­gal bal­lots. This is the only way to en­sure the pub­lic has full con­fi­dence in our elec­tion. It re­mains shock­ing that the Bi­den cam­paign re­fuses to agree with this ba­sic prin­ci­ple and wants bal­lots counted even if they are fraud­u­lent, man­u­fac­tured, or cast by in­el­i­gi­ble or de­ceased vot­ers. Only a party en­gaged in wrong­do­ing would un­law­fully keep ob­servers out of the count room – and then fight in court to block their ac­cess.</p>
    <p>So what is Bi­den hid­ing? I will not rest un­til the Amer­i­can Peo­ple have the hon­est vote count they de­serve and that Democ­racy de­mands.</p>
