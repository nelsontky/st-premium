    <p>At the United States Fed­eral Re­serve’s an­nual Jackson Hole sym­po­sium on Aug 27, its chair­man Jerome Pow­ell an­nounced a sig­nif­i­cant change in the way the Fed will con­duct mon­e­tary pol­icy in the fu­ture. Es­sen­tially, it will switch from tar­get­ing a fixed rate of 2 per cent in­fla­tion to tar­get­ing an av­er­age rate at that level. This means, for ex­am­ple, that if in­fla­tion un­der­shoots 2 per cent by, say, 50 ba­sis points for six months, the Fed will tol­er­ate an in­fla­tion rate of 2.5 per cent for six months, with­out rais­ing in­ter­est rates as it might have done in the past. It will also depart from its usual prac­tice of pre-emp­tively rais­ing rates in an­tic­i­pa­tion of higher in­fla­tion if un­em­ploy­ment ap­proaches “full em­ploy­ment” lev­els. The up­shot of all this is that US in­ter­est rates, cur­rently near zero, will re­main lower maybe for some years.</p>
    <p>This has ma­jor im­pli­ca­tions for the US and the global econ­omy, given that the Covid-19 pan­demic has sig­nif­i­cantly al­tered how con­sumers and busi­nesses be­have. The rea­sons for the Fed’s pol­icy pivot are un­der­stand­able. Ever since it adopted its 2 per cent in­fla­tion tar­get in 2012, it has con­sis­tently failed to achieve it. In the af­ter­math of the pan­demic, ul­tra-low in­fla­tion is es­pe­cially prob­lem­atic be­cause it would mean that the bur­den of cor­po­rate, house­hold and govern­ment debts – which are al­ready rising – would in­crease in real terms. Con­sump­tion could also go down if ex­pec­ta­tions of low in­fla­tion be­come en­trenched, which would jeop­ar­dise the eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>But there are risks to the Fed’s new ap­proach. The most im­por­tant is ag­gra­vated as­set price in­fla­tion. The Fed’s pol­icy change comes at a time when US stock mar­ket in­dexes are at close to record highs. US real es­tate prices are also rising and set to rise fur­ther. The re­sult­ing as­set price in­fla­tion in the face of soar­ing un­em­ploy­ment could lead to widen­ing in­equal­i­ties and as­set bub­bles, which would be vul­ner­a­ble to pop­ping once in­fla­tion even­tu­ally takes off – as it well might – and the Fed is forced to hike rates. The Fed’s pol­icy switch would also af­fect other cen­tral banks with sim­i­lar ef­fects. The Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank, which has strug­gled with low in­fla­tion and main­tains a neg­a­tive in­ter­est rate pol­icy, could ease mon­e­tary pol­icy fur­ther, es­pe­cially as the euro has strength­ened against the US dol­lar, which adds to de­fla­tion­ary pres­sures in the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Lower rates in the US and euro zone will en­able Asian cen­tral banks to keep rates low. While this would be help­ful dur­ing re­ces­sions that are wide­spread across the re­gion, this also runs the risk of as­set price in­fla­tion and widen­ing in­equal­i­ties. Asian gov­ern­ments, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s, thus need to coun­ter­act such risks through con­tin­ued tar­geted fis­cal sup­port to help lower-in­come groups, as well as through macro-pru­den­tial poli­cies – such as Sin­ga­pore’s prop­erty cool­ing mea­sures – to rein in as­set price in­fla­tion.</p>
