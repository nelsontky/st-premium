    <p>SHANG­HAI • Global fund man­agers are re­duc­ing their hold­ings in USlisted Chi­nese com­pa­nies such as Alibaba, NetEase and JD.com as risks grow that they will be forced off Amer­i­can ex­changes, switch­ing in­stead into shares of the com­pa­nies listed in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Delist­ing risks sur­faced last Septem­ber when Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion ex­plored moves to kick Chi­nese firms off Wall Street un­less they abide by US ac­count­ing stan­dards, part of an es­ca­lat­ing stand-off be­tween the world’s top two economies.</p>
    <p>The threat is now real. The Hold­ing For­eign Com­pa­nies Ac­count­able Act has been passed by both cham­bers of the US Congress and should soon be signed into law by Mr Trump. Once this hap­pens, for­eign is­suers in the United States that de­cline a re­view of their au­dits for three years can be delisted.</p>
    <p>Since most Chi­nese com­pa­nies are pro­hib­ited by main­land laws from dis­clos­ing in­for­ma­tion that might be con­sid­ered state se­crets, they are of­ten un­able to com­ply with such au­dit re­views, mak­ing them vul­ner­a­ble to delist­ing.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways some­thing you’re aware of as a po­ten­tial risk. Now that risk is re­ally be­com­ing a re­al­ity,” said Mr Brian Bandsma, a New York-based port­fo­lio man­ager at Von­to­bel As­set Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>He added that he has started mov­ing po­si­tions in Amer­i­can De­posi­tary Re­ceipts (ADRs) of Chi­nese com­pa­nies to­wards Hong Kong. There are two paths, he said, and he is tak­ing a slower but less costly route.</p>
    <p>Mr Ni­cholas Yeo, head of China eq­ui­ties at Aberdeen Stan­dard In­vest­ments, said his fund is mak­ing ad­just­ments too. “List­ing venue doesn’t re­ally mat­ter. For the sake of pru­dence, we just buy the same com­pa­nies in the Hong Kong mar­ket. The shift is quite easy.”</p>
    <p>An in­creas­ing num­ber of Chi­nese com­pa­nies have sec­ondary list­ings in Hong Kong, giv­ing in­vestors an al­ter­na­tive.</p>
    <p>US-listed Chi­nese firms, in­clud­ing Alibaba, JD.com, NetEase, Yum China and New Ori­en­tal have al­ready floated in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>More than 20 other ADRs – in­clud­ing Pin­duo­duo, Vip­shop and Bili­bili – are also el­i­gi­ble for a Hong Kong sec­ondary list­ing, ac­cord­ing to Mor­gan Stan­ley.</p>
    <p>Mr Bren­dan Ah­ern, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer at New York-based Krane Funds Ad­vi­sors, be­lieves most con­ver­sions so far have come from Asian and Euro­pean in­vestors who want to align them­selves with their in­vestor base.</p>
    <p>Singapore’s Te­masek said in Septem­ber that it had swapped half its stake in Alibaba – worth about US$3 bil­lion (S$4 bil­lion) – from the US to Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Matthews Asia told in­vestors in July that it owned Chi­nese firms such as Alibaba through both US and Hong Kong list­ings.</p>
    <p>For US in­vestors, there is also the op­tion of trad­ing Chi­nese firms such as Ten­cent in the less liq­uid over-the-counter mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Ah­ern be­lieves China and the US will even­tu­ally come up with a plan to avoid whole­sale delist­ings that could af­fect over US$2 tril­lion in Amer­i­can sav­ings in­vested in US-listed Chi­nese com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“(We) will not stand idle as we have a fidu­ciary obli­ga­tion to pro­tect our in­vestors,” he said, adding that the firm had done a test con­ver­sion of Alibaba’s US shares to Hong Kong shares, prov­ing the process is “ex­cep­tion­ally easy”.</p>
    <p>Fund man­agers say US and Hong Kong-listed shares are com­pletely fun­gi­ble, with lit­tle price dif­fer­ence or cost. Still, in a worst-case sce­nario, a large ex­o­dus of Chi­nese com­pa­nies would af­fect in­vestors and re­duce com­pet­i­tive­ness of the US cap­i­tal mar­kets, a lawyer who works with an ADR de­posi­tary said on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>“If you take away prom­i­nent suc­cess­ful com­pa­nies from US ex­changes, it will make Lon­don or Hong Kong or both stronger and will cre­ate a per­cep­tion that now there are pos­si­bly bet­ter choices than US ex­changes.”</p>
    <p>Since most Chi­nese com­pa­nies are pro­hib­ited by main­land laws from dis­clos­ing in­for­ma­tion that might be con­sid­ered state se­crets, they are of­ten un­able to com­ply with such (US) au­dit re­views, mak­ing them vul­ner­a­ble to delist­ing.</p>
