    <p>The con­tin­ued in­crease in Covid-19 cases around the world is rea­son enough for us to stay vig­i­lant and not let our guard down.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore are do­ing their best to keep us safe, but the re­spon­si­bil­ity does not fall on them alone. Ev­ery­one has a part to play. The least we can do is to fol­low the rules and in­struc­tions that have been set.</p>
    <p>On pub­lic buses and MRT trains, pas­sen­gers are in close prox­im­ity to one an­other in a con­fined space.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have been re­mind­ing pas­sen­gers to avoid talk­ing to one an­other or on their cell­phones, as do­ing so could in­crease the po­ten­tial spread of the coro­n­avirus through droplets in the breath.</p>
    <p>But in spite of that, many com­muters do not take the ad­vice se­ri­ously. Per­haps, more re­minders should be put up in buses and trains. There should also be more fre­quent re­minder an­nounce­ments in trains.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors could also be de­ployed on board buses and trains to en­sure that com­muters fol­low the rules.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, schools and in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing should re­mind stu­dents of safe mea­sures reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>I of­ten see large groups of stu­dents gath­er­ing in pub­lic ar­eas. They may not fully un­der­stand the sever­ity of the virus or may be re­fus­ing to fol­low the rules. Ei­ther way, this is­sue needs to be ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>More cre­ative ways are needed to en­sure that the mi­nor­ity who refuse to fol­low rules un­der­stand the risk they pose to their loved ones.</p>
    <p>The virus sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore is un­der con­trol but this could lead to a false sense of se­cu­rity among some.</p>
    <p>Con­stant and reg­u­lar re­minders might be what is needed.</p>
    <p>More cre­ative ways are needed to en­sure that the mi­nor­ity who refuse to fol­low rules un­der­stand the risk they pose to their loved ones.</p>
