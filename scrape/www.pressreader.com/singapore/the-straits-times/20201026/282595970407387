    <p>NEW YORK • The last time Keith Jar­rett per­formed in public, his re­la­tion­ship with the pi­ano was the least of his con­cerns.</p>
    <p>This was at Carnegie Hall in 2017, sev­eral weeks into the ad­min­is­tra­tion of a di­vi­sive new United States pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Jar­rett – one of the most her­alded pi­anists alive, a gal­vanis­ing j azz artist who has also recorded a wealth of clas­si­cal mu­sic – opened with an in­dig­nant speech on the po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion and un­spooled a re­lent­less com­men­tary through­out the con­cert. He ended by thank­ing the au­di­ence for bring­ing him to tears.</p>
    <p>He had been sched­uled to re­turn to Carnegie the fol­low­ing March for an­other of the solo recitals that have done the most to cre­ate his leg­end – like the one cap­tured on the record­ing Bu­dapest Con­cert, to be re­leased on Fri­day. But that Carnegie per­for­mance was abruptly can­celled, along with the rest of his con­cert cal­en­dar.</p>
    <p>At the time, Jar­rett’s long-time record la­bel, ECM, cited un­spec­i­fied health is­sues. There was no of­fi­cial up­date in the next two years.</p>
    <p>But this month, Jar­rett, 75, broke the si­lence, plainly stat­ing what hap­pened to him – a stroke in late Fe­bru­ary 2018, fol­lowed by an­other one that May. It is un­likely he will per­form in public again.</p>
    <p>“I was paral­ysed,” he said by phone from his home in north-west New Jersey. “My left side is still par­tially paral­ysed. I’m able to try to walk with a cane, but it took a long time for that, a year or more. And I’m not get­ting around this house at all, re­ally.”</p>
    <p>Jar­rett did not re­alise how se­ri­ous his first stroke was. But af­ter more symp­toms emerged, he was taken to a hos­pi­tal, where he grad­u­ally re­cov­ered enough to be dis­charged.</p>
    <p>His sec­ond stroke hap­pened at home and he was ad­mit­ted to a nurs­ing fa­cil­ity. Dur­ing his time there, from July 2018 un­til this May, he made spo­radic use of its pi­ano room, play­ing right-handed coun­ter­point.</p>
    <p>“I was try­ing to pre­tend I was Bach with one hand,” he said. “But that was just toy­ing with some­thing.”</p>
    <p>When he tried to play some fa­mil­iar be­bop tunes in his home stu­dio re­cently, he dis­cov­ered he had for­got­ten them.</p>
    <p>Jar­rett’s voice is softer and thin­ner now. But over two roughly hour-long con­ver­sa­tions, he was lu­cid and leg­i­ble, aside from oc­ca­sional lapses in mem­ory. He of­ten punc­tu­ated a heavy or awk­ward state­ment with a laugh like a faint rhyth­mic ex­ha­la­tion: ah-ha-ha-ha.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what my fu­ture is sup­posed to be,” he said. “I don’t feel right now like I’m a pi­anist. That’s all I can say about that.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter a pause, he re­con­sid­ered. “When I hear two-handed pi­ano mu­sic, it’s very frus­trat­ing, in a phys­i­cal way. If I even hear Schu­bert or some­thing played softly, that’s enough for me. Be­cause I know I couldn’t do that. And I’m not ex­pected to re­cover that. The most I’m ex­pected to re­cover in my left hand is pos­si­bly the abil­ity to hold a cup. So it’s not a ‘shoot the pi­ano player’ thing. It’s ‘I al­ready got shot’. Ah-ha-ha-ha.”</p>
    <p>If the prospect of a Jar­rett who no longer con­sid­ers him­self a pi­anist is dumb­found­ing, it might be be­cause there has scarcely been a time he did not.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up in Al­len­town, Penn­syl­va­nia, he was a prodigy. Ac­cord­ing to fam­ily lore, he was three when an aunt in­di­cated a nearby stream and told him to turn its bur­bling into mu­sic – his first pi­ano im­pro­vi­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Broad public aware­ness caught up with him in the late 1960s, when he was in a zeit­geist-cap­tur­ing group led by Charles Lloyd, a sax­o­phon­ist and flautist.</p>
    <p>The bril­liant drum­mer in that quar­tet, Jack DeJohnette, then helped jazz icon Miles Davis push into rock and funk. Jar­rett fol­lowed suit, join­ing an in­can­des­cent edi­tion of Davis’ band. In live record­ings, his in­ter­ludes on elec­tric pi­ano cast a spell.</p>
    <p>Jar­rett soon hit on some­thing anal­o­gous in his own con­certs, al­low­ing im­pro­vised pas­sages to be­come the main event. He was a few years into this ap­proach in 1975, when he per­formed what would be­come The Koln Con­cert – a sonorous, mes­meris­ing land­mark that still stands as one of the best-sell­ing solo pi­ano al­bums made.</p>
    <p>He later re­con­vened his long­time trio, a mag­i­cally co­he­sive unit with DeJohnette and vir­tu­oso bassist Gary Pea­cock. Their first come­back con­cert, in 1998, re­cently sur­faced on record, join­ing a vo­lu­mi­nous discog­ra­phy. It cap­tures a spirit of joy­ous re­union not only for Jar­rett and his part­ners, but also between a per­form­ing artist and his public. He ti­tled that al­bum Af­ter The Fall. ECM re­leased it in March 2018, un­wit­tingly around the time of his first stroke.</p>
    <p>Loss has shrouded Jar­rett’s mu­si­cal cir­cle of late.</p>
    <p>Pea­cock died last month, at 85. Jon Chris­tensen, the drum­mer in Jar­rett’s in­flu­en­tial Euro­pean quar­tet of the 1970s, died ear­lier this year. Jar­rett also led a ground-break­ing Amer­i­can quar­tet in the 1970s, and its mem­bers – sax­o­phon­ist Dewey Red­man, bassist Charlie Haden and drum­mer Paul Mo­tian, all ma­jor fig­ures in mod­ern jazz – have died too.</p>
    <p>Faced with these and other dif­fi­cult truths, Jar­rett has not ex­actly found so­lace in mu­sic, as he once would have. But he de­rives sat­is­fac­tion from some record­ings of his fi­nal Euro­pean solo tour. He di­rected ECM to re­lease the tour’s clos­ing con­cert last year as Mu­nich 2016. He is even more en­thu­si­as­tic about the tour opener, Bu­dapest Con­cert, which he briefly con­sid­ered call­ing The Gold Stan­dard.</p>
