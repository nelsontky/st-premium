    <p>WASHINGTON • The Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) told Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s coro­n­avirus task force on Tues­day that its new guid­ance would cut quar­an­tine time for in­di­vid­u­als ex­posed to the virus by as much as half, ac­cord­ing to two peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The new rec­om­mended quar­an­tine would be seven days for those who test neg­a­tive af­ter ex­po­sure to Covid-19 and 10 days for those who do not take a test, said the peo­ple, who were granted anonymity to dis­cuss in­for­ma­tion that has not been made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>At present, CDC guide­lines for peo­ple who have been ex­posed is to “stay home for 14 days af­ter your last con­tact with a per­son who has Covid-19”. The CDC’s new guid­ance was re­ported on Tues­day by The New York Times.</p>
    <p>Over the week­end, mem­bers of the task force ap­peared on sev­eral news pro­grammes to prom­ise a swift roll-out of coro­n­avirus vac­cines by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Health­care work­ers and res­i­dents at long-term care cen­tres should be first in line for the vac­cines, said key gov­ern­ment ad­vis­ers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the US Trans­porta­tion De­part­ment has made prepa­ra­tions to en­able the “im­me­di­ate mass ship­ment” of Covid-19 vac­cines and com­pleted all nec­es­sary reg­u­la­tory mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The de­part­ment said US agen­cies have been co­or­di­nat­ing with pri­vate sec­tor com­pa­nies that will carry vac­cines from man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­i­ties to dis­tri­bu­tion cen­tres and in­oc­u­la­tion points.</p>
    <p>It said it has es­tab­lished “ap­pro­pri­ate safety re­quire­ments for all po­ten­tial haz­ards in­volved in ship­ping the vac­cine, in­clud­ing stan­dards for dry ice and lithium bat­ter­ies used in cool­ing”.</p>
    <p>The de­part­ment is pre­par­ing to en­sure de­liv­er­ies of vac­cine doses for about 40 mil­lion res­i­dents in the United States through Jan­uary, or about 20 mil­lion a month, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Health­care work­ers and oth­ers rec­om­mended for the first in­oc­u­la­tions could start get­ting shots within 24 hours of the vac­cine re­ceiv­ing reg­u­la­tory au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
