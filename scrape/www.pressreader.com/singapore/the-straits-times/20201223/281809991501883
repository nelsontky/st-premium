    <p>Sydney re­mains on ten­ter­hooks as a fresh Covid-19 clus­ter threat­ens to bring the city to a stand­still dur­ing the Christ­mas hol­i­day and prompts di­vi­sions on whether to adopt a tougher re­sponse.</p>
    <p>The clus­ter in the north­ern beaches re­gion has grown to 90 cases, in­clud­ing eight new cases yes­ter­day, down from 30 on Sun­day and 15 on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The New South Wales (NSW) gov­ern­ment will re­veal to­day whether its new restrictio­ns to deal with the out­break will be ex­tended into the Christ­mas hol­i­day pe­riod, which starts to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The curbs, im­posed ear­lier this week, in­clude an ef­fec­tive lock­down for the north­ern beaches as well as gath­er­ing lim­its of 10 peo­ple per house­hold through­out Sydney and other parts of the state.</p>
    <p>State Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian said she was con­cerned about the spread of the virus be­yond the north­ern beaches, as it is known that in­fected peo­ple had vis­ited venues across the state.</p>
    <p>But she was also con­cerned about tak­ing mea­sures that re­strict fam­i­lies from unit­ing over the Christ­mas hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>“If it wasn’t this time of the year, the de­ci­sion would be much eas­ier,” she said.</p>
    <p>The out­break came as a shock to Aus­tralia’s largest city, which had largely been op­er­at­ing as nor­mal af­ter more than five weeks with al­most no new lo­cal cases.</p>
    <p>Un­til re­cent days, restau­rants had been packed, and malls filled dur­ing the pre-Christ­mas rush.</p>
    <p>But the mood soured af­ter the au­thor­i­ties im­posed the fresh restrictio­ns and other states closed their bor­ders to vis­i­tors from NSW.</p>
    <p>Sydney’s res­i­dents have been flock­ing to Covid-19 test­ing cen­tres, lead­ing to record num­bers of daily tests. The au­thor­i­ties pro­cessed 44,466 tests on Mon­day alone – a record for the state.</p>
    <p>But there are con­cerns that the state has been too com­pla­cent about the risks of a sec­ond wave and this has led to di­vi­sions over the gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health ex­perts have been call­ing for stricter mea­sures, in­clud­ing manda­tory masks and a brief city­wide lock­down.</p>
    <p>The state gov­ern­ment rec­om­mends – but does not re­quire – mask-wear­ing in places such as shops and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert San­jaya Se­nanayake said masks were safe, cheap and ef­fec­tive, and should be com­pul­sory.</p>
    <p>“We know from ear­lier in the year when masks were rec­om­mended, not man­dated, a third of peo­ple wore masks,” he told Chan­nel Nine news net­work.</p>
    <p>“If you man­date, it is far likely to get a higher level of com­pli­ance.”</p>
    <p>Many ex­perts have urged the state to fol­low the lead of Vic­to­ria, which faced a sec­ond wave ear­lier this year and swiftly im­posed manda­tory masks and one of the world’s tough­est lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Omar Khor­shid has called for manda­tory masks and a “short and sharp” lock­down to sup­press Sydney’s out­break.</p>
    <p>But NSW Health Min­is­ter Brad Haz­zard re­jected the call for manda­tory masks, say­ing that such a mea­sure would be dif­fi­cult to en­force, par­tic­u­larly on pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>The state gov­ern­ment has in­sisted that its health mea­sures are ad­e­quate.</p>
    <p>Ms Bere­jik­lian urged peo­ple to com­ply with con­tact trac­ing rules.</p>
    <p>“We do have one of the best, if not the best, con­tact trac­ing teams on the planet,” she said.</p>
