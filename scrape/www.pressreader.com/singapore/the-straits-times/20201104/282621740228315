    <p>LON­DON • Wales man­ager and Manch­ester United great Ryan Giggs will not be in­volved in his coun­try’s next three in­ter­na­tional games fol­low­ing his ar­rest for as­sault on Mon­day night.</p>
    <p>The Football As­so­ci­a­tion of Wales (FAW) yes­ter­day is­sued a state­ment, which read: “Our agreed im­me­di­ate pri­or­ity is pre­par­ing the team for the up­com­ing in­ter­na­tional matches.</p>
    <p>“(Coach) Robert Page will take charge for the next three matches against the USA, Repub­lic of Ire­land and Fin­land sup­ported by Al­bert Stu­iv­en­berg.</p>
    <p>“The FAW will not be mak­ing any fur­ther com­ment at this cur­rent time.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer mid­fielder has de­nied all al­le­ga­tions of as­sault, with his rep­re­sen­ta­tive say­ing: “Mr Giggs de­nies all al­le­ga­tions of as­sault made against him. He is co­op­er­at­ing with the po­lice and will con­tinue to as­sist them with their on­go­ing investigat­ions.”</p>
    <p>Po­lice of­fi­cers were called to his Manch­ester home on Sun­day night fol­low­ing re­ports of “a dis­tur­bance” in­volv­ing his girl­friend Kate Gre­ville, and he was ar­rested on sus­pi­cion of ac­tual bod­ily harm and as­sault.</p>
    <p>A Greater Manch­ester po­lice spokesman told The Sun: “Po­lice were called at 10.05pm on Sun­day to re­ports of a dis­tur­bance. A woman in her 30s sus­tained mi­nor in­juries but did not re­quire any treat­ment.</p>
    <p>“A 46-year-old man was ar­rested on sus­pi­cion of sec­tion 47 as­sault and sec­tion 39 com­mon as­sault.”</p>
    <p>Giggs, 46, has since been re­leased on bail and was pho­tographed leaving a po­lice sta­tion on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Giggs was ap­pointed Wales man­ager in Jan­uary 2018 after a stel­lar 24-year play­ing ca­reer at United, dur­ing which he won 13 Pre­mier League ti­tles, t wo Cham­pi­ons Leagues, four FA Cups and three League Cups, earn­ing 64 in­terna</p>
    <p>tional caps.</p>
    <p>He led the Dragons to qual­i­fi­ca­tion for next year’s Euro 2020 – their sec­ond straight Euro­pean Cham­pi­onship – after com­ing sec­ond to World Cup fi­nal­ists Croa­tia in Group E.</p>
    <p>Giggs and Gre­ville have been in an on-and-off re­la­tion­ship since 2017. The cou­ple first met in 2013 after she started do­ing public re­la­tions work for Ho­tel Football, an up­scale ho­tel over­look­ing Old Traf­ford that Giggs co-owns with for­mer team­mates Paul Sc­holes, Nicky Butt and broth­ers Phil and Gary Neville.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Giggs di­vorced his wife of 10 years Stacey Cooke, six years after an eight-year af­fair with his brother Rho­dri’s wife, Natasha, first be­came public.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his mar­riage, he also had another public af­fair with model and Big Brother con­tes­tant Imo­gen Thomas.</p>
