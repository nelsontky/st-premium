    <p>AW­FULLY JOY­FUL Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra Sin­ga­pore Con­fer­ence Hall Last Fri­day</p>
    <p>The ti­tle of the lat­est live con­cert by the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra (SCO) sounds like a mis­nomer.</p>
    <p>How could the feel­ing of joy be de­scribed as aw­ful? Un­less one ap­plies the col­lo­quial use of the word, such as in “aw­fully good” or “aw­fully nice”, it makes no sense.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, this cham­ber con­cert, at­tended by a so­cially dis­tanced au­di­ence now ex­panded to 100, was just the right an­ti­dote to the doom and gloom cast by the global coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery piece of mu­sic per­formed was sim­ple in con­cep­tion, light­hearted, happy or a com­bi­na­tion of all three. There was no need for the plumb­ing of depths or pro­found thoughts here.</p>
    <p>Open­ing with Li Nixia’s Rain­drops, bits of tones is­sued from four dizi play­ers, seem­ingly ran­dom in se­quence, but soon co­a­lesc­ing into a driz­zle and, later, a tor­ren­tial down­pour. The il­lu­sion of coun­ter­point was quite a clever one; such is the na­ture of fall­ing rain.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal com­poser Wang Chen­wei’s Child­hood for six sheng play­ers was a tran­scrip­tion of a work from his teenage years. Like a sage re­count­ing the joys of sim­pler times, its catchy themes and fast-slow-fast form were easy to fol­low, thus mak­ing for a last­ing im­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Li Bochan’s Bows And Strings, for three er­hus and three zhonghus, was a sooth­ing ser­e­nade, with Ling Hock Siang’s erhu car­ry­ing the melodic line. It ended qui­etly with all strings com­muning in hushed and be­atific uni­son.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Bai Haoyu’s Rem­i­nis­cence for plucked and strummed strings (pipa, ruan, li­uqin and yangqin) was a sen­ti­men­tal love song, one im­bued with the sen­si­bil­i­ties of pop songs and ro­man­tic film mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Jiang Ying’s very pop­u­lar Dun­huang, for a mixed en­sem­ble of eight play­ers, was led by SCO res­i­dent con­duc­tor Quek Ling Kiong, who also dou­bled on drum and cym­bals. This rhap­sodic num­ber was Cen­tral Asian in flavour, work­ing its way from a slow be­gin­ning to a fast and rau­cous dance-like con­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>On a qui­eter but sim­i­larly ex­hil­a­rat­ing note was Liu Xing’s Tues­day Gath­er­ings, an evo­ca­tion of nos­tal­gia and ca­ma­raderie. This el­e­gant work pos­sessed the qual­ity of elo­quent con­ver­sa­tion be­tween long-time friends, with the dizi as the pro­tag­o­nist.</p>
    <p>To close was Zhang Yima’s Bu Yi Le Hu (De­light), per­formed by a tutti en­sem­ble with in­struc­tors and alumni of the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Youth Chi­nese Orches­tra join­ing in.</p>
    <p>By now, one might have re­alised this to be the Chi­nese ti­tle of the con­cert. It also aptly de­scribed a happy-go-lucky, hang-loose kind of piece ac­com­pa­nied by fin­ger­snap­ping by the au­di­ence, pro­vid­ing a sat­is­fy­ing end to an en­joy­able evening.</p>
