    <p>Come Sept 18, Sin­ga­pore will be­come the first coun­try with which Ja­pan es­tab­lishes a green lane for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>This Busi­ness Track is mainly for short-term busi­ness trav­ellers and will al­low cross-bor­der travel and busi­ness ex­changes be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>But pub­lic health safe­guards need to be in place, the for­eign af­fairs min­istries of both coun­tries said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>On the Busi­ness Track with Sin­ga­pore, Ja­pan’s Min­is­ter for For­eign Af­fairs Toshim­itsu Motegi said in a me­dia con­fer­ence that “we will later broaden it to other coun­tries, we hope it can be a good model”.</p>
    <p>For now, Sin­ga­pore al­lows vis­i­tors from Brunei, China, Malaysia, New Zealand and South Korea, with a var­ied num­ber of restric­tions in place.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan have agreed to launch a green lane for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel for res­i­dents from both coun­tries on Sept 18.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment yes­ter­day, the for­eign af­fairs min­istries of both coun­tries said that the Busi­ness Track ar­range­ment will help re­store con­nec­tiv­ity and sup­port eco­nomic re­cov­ery for Ja­pan and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has sim­i­lar ar­range­ments with other coun­tries, but this is the first such frame­work that Ja­pan will im­ple­ment with another coun­try.</p>
    <p>The Busi­ness Track will al­low the safe re­sump­tion of cross-bor­der travel and busi­ness ex­changes with the nec­es­sary pub­lic health safe­guards in place, the coun­tries said.</p>
    <p>These safe­guards in­clude pre-de­par­ture and post-ar­rival test­ing, as well as the need to ad­here to a con­trolled itin­er­ary for the first 14 days in the re­ceiv­ing coun­try.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs said in a sep­a­rate state­ment that dur­ing the 14-day stay-home pe­riod, lim­ited busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties will be al­lowed. This par­tially re­laxes restric­tions on such ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>How­ever, trav­ellers must ac­cept ex­tra quar­an­tine mea­sures, like sub­mit­ting a sched­ule of their ac­tiv­i­ties in Ja­pan. The min­istry added that the Busi­ness Track is mainly for short-term busi­ness trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tional de­tails, in­clud­ing the re­quire­ments, health pro­to­cols and ap­pli­ca­tion process, will be pub­lished on the web­site of Ja­pan’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs and Sin­ga­pore’s SafeTravel web­site by Sept 18.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore cur­rently per­mits vis­i­tors from five coun­tries, with a var­ied num­ber of restric­tions in place.</p>
    <p>On June 3, Sin­ga­pore and China an­nounced de­tails of a “fast lane”, or “green lane”, agree­ment for trav­ellers from both sides to fly into each other’s coun­tries with­out serv­ing a quar­an­tine pe­riod of up to 14 days.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore then re­opened its bor­ders with Malaysia un­der two schemes – the Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane and the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment – on Aug 17.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral trav­ellers from New Zealand and Brunei started ar­riv­ing in Sin­ga­pore from Tues­day, while a Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane with the lat­ter was an­nounced on Sept 1.</p>
    <p>On Sept 2, a “fast lane” for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and South Korea was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Con­sulate-Gen­eral in Hong Kong said on Thurs­day that the Re­pub­lic wel­comes talks with Hong Kong on the grad­ual re­sump­tion of cross-bor­der travel be­tween the two sides.</p>
