    <p>A $25 mil­lion ini­tia­tive with the dual aim of sup­port­ing pro­jects that help peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and fund­ing pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion for a more in­clu­sive so­ci­ety was launched yes­ter­day. The launch at the En­abling Vil­lage was at­tended by Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli (above).</p>
    <p>A new $25 mil­lion ini­tia­tive with the dual aim of sup­port­ing pro­jects that help peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and fund­ing pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion for a more in­clu­sive so­ci­ety was launched yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The new En­abling Lives Ini­tia­tive (ELI) – a part­ner­ship be­tween SG En­able and the Tote Board – will run from this year to 2024, tak­ing over the pre­vi­ous Tote Board En­abling Lives Ini­tia­tive that ran for five years from 2015.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new scheme, the Tote Board has com­mit­ted $20 mil­lion to the ELI Grant that will sup­port ini­tia­tives on the ground and $5 mil­lion for pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Care & Share Move­ment, led by the Com­mu­nity Chest, has also com­mit­ted $1.196 mil­lion to co­fund pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s launch at the En­abling Vil­lage, a com­mu­nity space at Lengkok Bahru for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, was at­tended by Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos said the ELI is an­other mile­stone in Sin­ga­pore’s en­deav­our to build a car­ing and in­clu­sive so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>He said: “It takes more than just the ef­forts of the dis­abil­ity sec­tor to re­alise this vi­sion. Ev­ery­one has a part to play.</p>
    <p>“By shar­ing a com­mon goal, we can rally a di­verse com­mu­nity of part­ners – each with their own</p>
    <p>strengths and re­sources – to come to­gether and cre­ate im­pact­ful so­lu­tions to foster stronger in­clu­sive­ness.”</p>
    <p>The ELI Grant will open for ap­pli­ca­tions in April next year and sup­port pro­jects across the fol­low­ing fo­cus ar­eas – liv­ing in­de­pen­dently, re­al­is­ing po­ten­tial and con­nect­ing com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>It aims to fund pro­jects that will cre­ate scal­able and im­pact­ful in­no­va­tions for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and bring about bet­ter out­comes for them.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous Tote Board ELI Grant sup­ported more than 40 such pro­jects with over $16 mil­lion in fund­ing be­tween 2015 and this year. Those pro­jects helped over 8,000 peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and their care­givers.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion ini­tia­tive aims to bring about more in­clu­sion at schools, at work and in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>It hopes to build on the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice’s See The True Me pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion cam­paign that was launched in 2016.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign en­cour­aged Sin­ga­pore­ans to look be­yond the dis­abil­ity and see peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties for who they are and what they can do.</p>
    <p>Tote Board chair­man Moses Lee said at the event that peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and their care­givers have faced ad­di­tional chal­lenges amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, given their more com­plex and di­verse needs and the strain from stay­ing at home more.</p>
    <p>“It is even more im­por­tant now that we step up and make a con­certed ef­fort to help and sup­port per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties and their care­givers to see them through th­ese dif­fi­cult times,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the $25 mil­lion ELI is part of more than $216 mil­lion of funds the Tote Board is pro­vid­ing to sup­port crit­i­cal and strate­gic ser­vices for the dis­abil­ity sec­tor from this year to 2024.</p>
    <p>SG En­able chief ex­ec­u­tive Ku Geok Boon said that pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion ef­forts will also fo­cus on pro­mot­ing in­clu­sion in es­sen­tial ser­vices, such as trans­port.</p>
    <p>She added that the ini­tia­tive will ac­tively in­volve peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties and their care­givers.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Ku: “Their voices, their as­pi­ra­tions and their hopes can help us see and recog­nise that, like each of us, they too are very much in­te­gral mem­bers of our so­ci­ety.”</p>
