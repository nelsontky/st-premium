    <p>GENEVA • With Mr Roberto Azevedo’s de­par­ture f rom the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) yes­ter­day, the in­sti­tu­tion faces multiple crises with­out a cap­tain – a sit­u­a­tion that experts warn could drag on for months.</p>
    <p>Any fu­ture WTO leader will head an or­gan­i­sa­tion mired in stalled trade talks and strug­gling to curb trade ten­sions be­tween the United States and China.</p>
    <p>It must also help mem­ber coun­tries nav­i­gate a dev­as­tat­ing global eco­nomic slump sparked by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The WTO is fac­ing re­lent­less at­tacks from Washington, which has crip­pled the trade body’s dis­pute set­tle­ment ap­peal sys­tem and threat­ened to leave the or­gan­i­sa­tion al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>Many ob­servers fear that in­tran­si­gent US po­si­tions could paral­yse the WTO process of des­ig­nat­ing a new di­rec­tor-gen­eral, leav­ing the or­gan­i­sa­tion lead­er­less for the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“The US de­mands that the new di­rec­tor-gen­eral shares US con­cerns, many of which are about ad­dress­ing con­cerns re­lated to China,” Pro­fes­sor Man­fred El­sig, an in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions ex­pert at the World Trade In­sti­tute i n Bern, said.</p>
    <p>“Given that the di­rec­tor-gen­eral is cho­sen by con­sen­sus, this tough stance com­pli­cates the se­lec­tion.”</p>
    <p>The WTO has al­ready pre­sented a time­line for se­lect­ing one of eight can­di­dates in the run­ning to re­place Mr Azevedo within a few months.</p>
    <p>But Prof El­sig warned that “the process is al­ready tor­pe­doed. It could well be that many WTO mem­bers want to wait un­til af­ter the (Nov 3 US) elec­tion, hop­ing that the ad­min­is­tra­tion changes”.</p>
    <p>Mr Azevedo’s sur­prise an­nounce­ment in May that he would end his sec­ond WTO term 12 months early forced the or­gan­i­sa­tion to speed up its usu­ally lengthy process of se­lect­ing a new leader.</p>
    <p>Three Africans, two Euro­peans, two Asians and one Latin Amer­i­can quickly threw their hats in the ring.</p>
    <p>The WTO is due next month to be­gin three rounds of con­sul­ta­tions – dubbed “con­fes­sion­als” – in which all mem­ber states con­fi­den­tially voice their pref­er­ences, grad­u­ally whit­tling down the list. The process, based on con­sen­sus, is ex­pected to last un­til mid-Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>But soar­ing in­ter­na­tional ten­sions and grow­ing politi­ci­sa­tion of picks to head UN agen­cies and other in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions could trip up the ten­ta­tive time­line.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers failed last month to pick an act­ing chief from among four deputy di­rec­tors – usu­ally a straight­for­ward process.</p>
    <p>Brus­sels and Washington butted heads over whether Ger­man Karl Brauner or Amer­i­can Alan Wolff should get the job, in what ob­servers say was un­prece­dented politi­ci­sa­tion of an ad­min­is­tra­tive de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Ms Elvire Fabry, a re­searcher at the Jac­ques Delors In­sti­tute, said that “the US veto” of widely­backed Mr Brauner was first and fore­most linked to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s wish to “in­crease the power play to­wards the Eu­ro­pean Union... ahead of the elec­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Mak­ing such a con­ces­sion, even for an in­terim (chief), would have been too much for him,” she said, adding that Washington might also ex­pect the in­terim pe­riod “to be longer than pre­dicted, and does not want to al­low a Eu­ro­pean to set­tle into the po­si­tion”.</p>
    <p>A Western trade diplo­mat who asked not to be named said there was con­cern over how far some might be will­ing to go to pre­vail.</p>
    <p>Mr Sebastien Jean, head of the French re­search cen­tre Cepii, said: “It is dif­fi­cult to mea­sure the harm­ful power the US is ex­ert­ing on this process, to know how far they can and want to go to in­ter­fere and dis­rupt things.”</p>
    <p>He added: “I think that is the great un­known. There is a feel­ing that the US will prob­a­bly re­main fairly pas­sive and show lit­tle good will un­til Nov 3.”</p>
    <p>Some think the wait could last un­til Jan 20, when the next US pres­i­dent is sworn in, be­fore things will move for­ward.</p>
    <p>Many say the process has never been so politi­cised, and some sug­gest the or­gan­i­sa­tion might be forced to ditch its long-held pol­icy of con­sen­sus and ask mem­bers to vote. That would mark a big shift.</p>
    <p>In 1999, when mem­bers were un­able to unan­i­mously choose who should be given four years at the helm, they opted to hand the two top picks a three-year man­date each in­stead of re­sort­ing to a vote.</p>
    <p>But Prof El­sig said such a de­ci­sion would be un­for­tu­nate in the cur­rent cli­mate. “Some­one with a short three-year ten­ure might likely be per­ceived as a lame duck from the be­gin­ning,” he said.</p>
