    <p>Aus­tralia is on course to be­gin ad­min­is­ter­ing the first Covid-19 vac­cines next month, said Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son yes­ter­day, as the coun­try moves to ac­cel­er­ate its in­oc­u­la­tion pro­gramme while two states try to con­tain out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said Aus­tralia’s phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal reg­u­la­tor is ex­pected to ap­prove the use of the</p>
    <p>Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine by the end of this month, with the first doses is­sued within weeks.</p>
    <p>“We are now in a po­si­tion where we be­lieve we will be able to com­mence vac­ci­na­tions in mid- to late Fe­bru­ary,” Mr Mor­ri­son told re­porters in Can­berra.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, Aus­tralia said it ex­pected to be­gin Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions in March.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has re­ported just over 28,500 Covid-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pan­demic be­gan, with bor­der clo­sures and speedy track­ing sys­tems help­ing to keep num­bers rel­a­tively low. The au­thor­i­ties are try­ing to con­tain new virus clus­ters in its largest ci­ties, Syd­ney and Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>The most pop­u­lous state New South Wales, the epi­cen­tre of the coun­try’s lat­est out­break, yes­ter­day said it recorded zero lo­cal in­fec­tions in the past 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has or­dered 10 mil­lion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine. It has also struck a deal with As­traZeneca in which the vac­cine will be pro­duced lo­cally.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son said reg­u­la­tory ap­proval of the As­traZeneca vac­cine is ex­pected next month.</p>
    <p>Once both are ap­proved, he said, Aus­tralia aims to vac­ci­nate 80,000 peo­ple each week. This would then be ex­panded in the fol­low­ing four to six weeks, and by the end of March, four mil­lion peo­ple could be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>The ac­cel­er­a­tion in the Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme comes amid height­ened con­cern about the spread of the virus glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s na­tional Cab­i­net will meet a month ear­lier than sched­uled to­day, Mr Mor­ri­son said, as the au­thor­i­ties seek to stop the spread of a more con­ta­gious vari­ant of Covid-19 that emerged in Bri­tain. A hand­ful of in­ter­na­tional ar­rivals in Aus­tralia have tested pos­i­tive for this strain.</p>
    <p>The Cab­i­net meet­ing will con­sider pro­pos­als to strengthen travel rules for cit­i­zens and res­i­dents re­turn­ing from over­seas, Mr Mor­ri­son wrote in a Face­book post late on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian me­dia re­ported that the gov­ern­ment plans to in­tro­duce manda­tory Covid-19 test­ing for all in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers be­fore they board their flights to the coun­try.</p>
