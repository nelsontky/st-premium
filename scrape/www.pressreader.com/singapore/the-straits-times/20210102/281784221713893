    <p>BANGKOK • The Thai cap­i­tal of Bangkok will close all schools for two weeks af­ter the New Year hol­i­day as it tight­ens mea­sures to con­trol a new wave of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the city said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Thai­land confirmed 279 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, most of them linked to a clus­ter among mi­grant work­ers in Sa­mut Sakhon prov­ince south of Bangkok, and another clus­ter linked to il­le­gal gam­bling dens that started in the east­ern prov­ince of Ray­ong.</p>
    <p>These new clus­ters have started to spread in Bangkok, prompt­ing city of­fi­cials to tighten mea­sures to curb the in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“We are be­gin­ning to de­tect new cases linked to stu­dents and other ser­vice busi­nesses,” said Mr Pongsakorn Kwan­muang, the spokesman for the Bangkok Met­ro­pol­i­tan Ad­min­is­tra­tion. “There­fore, we de­cided to close more places,” he said.</p>
    <p>All schools, day­care cen­tres for the young and the elderly, preschools and tu­ition cen­tres will be close from next Mon­day to Jan 17 while other public fa­cil­i­ties, in­clud­ing amuse­ment parks, play­grounds, public baths and mas­sage par­lours, will be closed start­ing from to­day, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Pongsakorn also said the city is con­sid­er­ing re­stric­tions on eat­ing in at restau­rants but that more dis­cus­sions were needed with the govern­ment’s Covid-19 task force to­day.</p>
    <p>Thai­land recorded two new deaths from coro­n­avirus yes­ter­day, tak­ing the num­ber of deaths to 63, while the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions hit 7,163 since the out­break started in Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the new cases re­sulted from lo­cal trans­mis­sion of the dis­ease while six were im­ported, ac­cord­ing to the Covid-19 task force.</p>
    <p>The two pa­tients re­ported to have died yes­ter­day were a 44-year-old Thai man who had vis­ited a crowded bar in Bangkok, and a 70-year-old Thai man who had il­le­gally slipped across the ThaiMyan­mar bor­der in Mae Sot dis­trict of Tak prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Bangkok Post, the govern­ment task force was con­cerned that more cases would be re­ported as peo­ple travel from or re­turn to the prov­inces dur­ing the New Year hol­i­day, which started on Thurs­day and ends to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Dr Taweesilp Visanuyoth­in, the task force’s spokesman, warned that the sit­u­a­tion re­mains se­ri­ous and it could take some time for the au­thor­i­ties to get it un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>“Do not ex­pect the spread to end to­day or to­mor­row,” he said, adding that he ex­pected the sit­u­a­tion to ease in mid-Fe­bru­ary, said the Bangkok Post.</p>
    <p>All schools, day­care cen­tres for the young and the elderly, pre-schools and tu­ition cen­tres will be closed from next Mon­day to Jan 17 while other public fa­cil­i­ties, in­clud­ing amuse­ment parks, play­grounds, public baths and mas­sage par­lours, will be closed start­ing from to­day.</p>
