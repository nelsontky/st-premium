    <p>WASHINGTON • The In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) said yesterday that fore­casts for the global econ­omy were “some­what less dire” as wealthy coun­tries and China re­bounded more quickly than ex­pected from coro­n­avirus lock­downs, but warned that the out­look was wors­en­ing for many emerg­ing mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The IMF fore­cast a 2020 global con­trac­tion of 4.4 per cent in its lat­est World Eco­nomic Out­look, an im­prove­ment from a 5.2 per cent con­trac­tion pre­dicted in June, when busi­ness clo­sures reached their peak. It is still the worst eco­nomic cri­sis since the 1930s Great De­pres­sion, it said.</p>
    <p>The global econ­omy will re­turn to growth of 5.2 per cent next year, the IMF said, but the re­bound will be slightly weaker than fore­cast in June, partly due to the ex­treme dif­fi­cul­ties for many emerg­ing mar­kets and slow­ing re­open­ing mo­men­tum as the virus con­tin­ues to spread.</p>
    <p>The fore­casts re­flect re­vised for­eign ex­change weight­ings for pur­chas­ing power par­ity that slightly in­crease the in­flu­ence of ad­vanced economies on global out­put.</p>
    <p>IMF chief econ­o­mist Gita Gopinath said in a blog post­ing that some US$12 tril­lion (S$16.3 tril­lion) in fis­cal sup­port and un­prece­dented mon­e­tary eas­ing from gov­ern­ments and cen­tral banks helped to limit the dam­age, but em­ploy­ment is well be­low pre-pan­demic lev­els, with low-in­come work­ers, youth and women hard­est hit.</p>
    <p>“The poor are get­ting poorer with close to 90 mil­lion peo­ple ex­pected to fall into ex­treme de­pri­va­tion this year,” Dr Gopinath said. “The as­cent out of this calamity is likely to be long, un­even and highly un­cer­tain. It is es­sen­tial that fis­cal and mon­e­tary pol­icy sup­port are not pre­ma­turely with­drawn.”</p>
    <p>The IMF said the United States will see a 4.3 per cent con­trac­tion in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct this year, far less se­vere than the 8 per cent con­trac­tion fore­cast in June. But next year’s US re­bound will be some­what smaller at 3.1 per cent, as­sum­ing no new fed­eral aid be­yond US$3 tril­lion ap­proved in March.</p>
    <p>The euro zone’s econ­omy will shrink by 8.3 per cent this year, an im­prove­ment from a 10.2 per cent con­trac­tion pre­dicted in June, but there is wide di­ver­gence within the group. Ex­port pow­er­house Ger­many will see a 6 per cent con­trac­tion this year, while Spain’s econ­omy, more de­pen­dent on tourism, will shrink by 12.8 per cent. The euro zone will re­sume growth of 5.2 per cent next year, the IMF said.</p>
    <p>China, which saw a strong early re­open­ing and re­bound from the pan­demic, will be the only econ­omy to show pos­i­tive growth this year, of 1.9 per cent – nearly dou­ble the rate pre­dicted in June – and reach 8.2 per cent growth next year, its high­est rate in nearly a decade, the IMF said.</p>
    <p>China had re­opened most of its econ­omy by April and has seen strong de­mand for ex­ports of its med­i­cal sup­plies and tech­nol­ogy prod­ucts needed to aid re­mote work­ing, the IMF said.</p>
    <p>But emerg­ing mar­kets other than China will see a 2020 con­trac­tion of 5.7 per cent, worse than the 5 per cent pre­dicted in June. The IMF said the virus was con­tin­u­ing to spread in large coun­tries, in­clud­ing In­dia and In­done­sia, and these economies are far more de­pen­dent on hard-hit sec­tors such as tourism and com­modi­ties as well as on re­mit­tances and other sources of ex­ter­nal fi­nance.</p>
