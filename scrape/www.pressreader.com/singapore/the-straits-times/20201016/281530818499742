    <p>The stalled Sin­ga­pore Premier League restarts to­mor­row in a slimmed-down for­mat over a con­gested nine weeks. With the Sin­ga­pore Cup canned and cham­pi­ons Brunei DPMM’s re­turn un­con­firmed, there is ev­ery­thing to play for, and the sit­u­a­tion looks bright for early lead­ers Tampines Rovers.</p>
    <p>A trun­cated ver­sion of the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) re­turns to­mor­row but that does not mean it will be de­void of thrills.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally a three-round com­pe­ti­tion, nine teams will now duke it out over just two rounds in a jam­packed nine weeks, start­ing from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>With fewer games and the can­cel­la­tion of the Sin­ga­pore Cup, the mar­gin for er­ror will be smaller, with big stakes in the form of one tro­phy, one spot in the AFC Cham­pi­ons League – the con­ti­nent’s top club com­pe­ti­tion – and two berths in the sec­ond-tier AFC Cup up for grabs.</p>
    <p>POLE PO­SI­TION NOT AN IN­DI­CA­TOR</p>
    <p>While de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons Brunei DPMM’s par­tic­i­pa­tion is still i n doubt, and the de­vel­op­men­tal Young Li­ons side not in the reck­on­ing for the ti­tle, the sit­u­a­tion may favour lead­ers Tampines Rovers, who have al­ready beaten ri­vals Lion City Sailors once, and who have the ben­e­fit of not be­ing dis­tracted by the post­poned Asean Club Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>With nine points from four games, they have fewer matches re­main­ing, which means more rest in be­tween.</p>
    <p>The Stags also restart with a clean bill of health, with de­fender Madhu Mo­hana re­turn­ing from an an­kle lig­a­ment tear.</p>
    <p>While they lost mid­fielder Safirul Su­laiman to Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional, they have also strength­ened at both ends by sign­ing vet­er­ans Bai­hakki Khaizan and Fazrul Nawaz, who were with­out a club after be­ing re­leased by their pre­vi­ous over­seas teams.</p>
    <p>Tampines coach Gavin Lee said: “I told the boys this is like a For­mula One race – we have qual­i­fied in pole po­si­tion, but it doesn’t mean we will fin­ish first. We have to main­tain our level-head­ed­ness and qual­ity in games.</p>
    <p>“Our po­si­tion helps, but it is no guar­an­tee (of suc­cess). There is the big in­cen­tive of play­ing in next sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League, but our job is to be con­sis­tent and play our best re­gard­less of the in­cen­tives.”</p>
    <p>A MID­DLE-DIS­TANCE RACE</p>
    <p>Lion City Sailors gen­eral man­ager Badri Ghent agreed that con­sis­tency is key with the con­densed for­mat, but added that teams that hit the road run­ning will have an ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>He said: “If the three rounds were a marathon, we are now look­ing at a mid­dle-dis­tance race, and a good start will be im­por­tant be­cause there won’t be many games to play catch-up.”</p>
    <p>The Sailors, who are the SPL’s only pri­va­tised club, en­dured a dif­fi­cult start to the sea­son after be­ing held 1-1 by Tan­jong Pa­gar United be­fore be­ing thumped 4-0 by Tampines, as they slumped to eighth.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the en­forced break, coach Aure­lio Vid­mar made ar­guably the big­gest trans­fer move by pinch­ing proven striker Stipe Plaz­i­bat from Hougang United to re­place Andy Pen­gelly. Since 2016, the 31-yearold Croat has notched 54 goals in just 70 SPL games.</p>
    <p>They re­ceived another boost as for­ward Adam Swandi made use of the down­time to re­cover from a knee lig­a­ment tear to com­pen­sate for the loss of wide play­ers Amir­uldin As­raf and Ho Wai Loon through in­jury.</p>
    <p>Some may say the long break is of most ben­e­fit to the new-look Sailors, who were af­forded the time to re­group and gel, but Badri dis­missed this no­tion. He ar­gued: “It is true we needed time, but we also needed matches. As such, we are in the same po­si­tion as the other teams. What is cer­tain is we have a team that have a lot of hunger to do well and chal­lenge for the ti­tle.”</p>
    <p>There is also no lack of de­sire in Al­birex Ni­igata, the three-time league cham­pi­ons who have 18 Ja­panese and eight lo­cal play­ers, and be­lieve they can re­cap­ture the ti­tle they last won in 2018.</p>
    <p>The White Swans are also the SPL’s only un­beaten team after three games, al­though DPMM also won their only game.</p>
    <p>Al­birex gen­eral man­ager Koh Mui Tee said: “We have a group of young Ja­panese play­ers who can­not re­turn home be­cause of the travel re­stric­tions, and they have a lot of pent-up en­ergy which we hope to un­leash upon the restart.</p>
    <p>“The break is ac­tu­ally lost time in terms of play­ing and de­vel­op­ment time, but we have young and hun­gry play­ers – who want to be­come na­tional play­ers or play over­seas one day – that can help us meet our tar­get to win the league.”</p>
    <p>DON’T DIS­COUNT UN­DER­DOGS</p>
    <p>Out­side of the es­tab­lished or­der, un­der­dogs lurk. Some smell blood, and are not afraid to state their am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>Hougang coach Cle­ment Teo re­fused to see Plaz­i­bat’s de­par­ture as a big loss, and backed his lo­cal boys to raise more than a few eye­brows like they did last sea­son when they fin­ished third to qual­ify for the AFC Cup.</p>
    <p>He said: “Football is not a one</p>
    <p>FIRST OUT OF THE BLOCKS man game. We have Sahil Suhaimi, Shah­fiq Ghani, and Shawal Anuar, for­wards who all have na­tional team ex­pe­ri­ence and whom I find dif­fi­cult to start from the bench for the first time. Peo­ple may say they don’t have Stipe’s phys­i­cal pres­ence but they have grown stronger dur­ing this break.</p>
    <p>“Like some teams, we have lost some younger play­ers to na­tional ser­vice, but we are for­tu­nate to be able to con­vert play­ers to var­i­ous po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>“The can­cel­la­tion of this year’s AFC Cup also mo­ti­vates us be­cause now that we had a brief taste, we want a full ex­pe­ri­ence of continenta­l com­pe­ti­tion, and we aim to do bet­ter than last year.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, Gey­lang will rely more on lo­cal play­ers after re­leas­ing Greek mid­fielder Pana­gi­o­tis Li­nar­dos.</p>
    <p>Ea­gles coach Noor Ali said: “The AFF Suzuki Cup is next year (April 11 to May 8), and we have ca­pa­ble lo­cal play­ers who will want to be part of that. I have a lot of faith they can fin­ish among the top two lo­cal teams this sea­son.”</p>
    <p>Those with­out as much re­sources or strength in depth will be hop­ing their play­ers can avoid in­juries.</p>
    <p>Balestier Khalsa coach Marko Kral­je­vic said: “We have a small squad, but if our first team stay fit, we can chal­lenge any­body for a place in the top three. We showed that when we took the lead in the 2-2 draws against Al­birex and Hougang, and we missed a penalty in the 1-0 loss to Tampines.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have a big squad like the Sailors, but look­ing at how the league started, the com­pe­ti­tion is quite even and there are no surewin games.</p>
    <p>“It will be a chal­lenge to restart with­out any friendly games, I just hope we don’t pick up any in­juries.”</p>
    <p>While come­back kids Tan­jong Pa­gar are still look­ing for their first win of the sea­son, they have al­ready up­set the odds with well-de­served draws against the Sailors and Al­birex.</p>
    <p>But the Jaguars’ hopes of be­com­ing the SPL’s ver­sion of English Premier League side Leeds United are slightly dented as they have just 15 out­field play­ers – in­clud­ing new sign­ing Zulk­if­fli Has­sim – fit for se­lec­tion. Mid­fielder Far­i­hin Farkhan and for­wards Nashrul Amin and Luiz Ju­nior are still some way off a re­turn from se­ri­ous in­juries.</p>
    <p>Yet as­sis­tant coach Noh Alam Shah said: “We will stick to our mis­sion of be­ing a de­vel­op­men­tal club to launch coaches and play­ers to big­ger clubs.</p>
    <p>“We still have to find play­ers, but for a club that came back at the last minute, we can’t ask for more from our boys, who have shown great dis­ci­pline, ded­i­ca­tion and de­ter­mi­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“The com­par­i­son won’t be fair to Leeds, who are able to press very hard for the full match, while we can’t. But there is some­thing to learn – with a tight and men­tally strong unit, a bunch of un­knowns can achieve good re­sults.”</p>
    <p>If the three rounds were a marathon, we are now look­ing at a mid­dle-dis­tance race, and a good start will be im­por­tant be­cause there won’t be many games to play catch-up.</p>
    <p>BADRI GHENT, Lion City Sailors gen­eral man­ager, on the short­ened SPL sea­son and how his team, who have only played two games – at least one fewer than the other sides – need to make a quick start.</p>
