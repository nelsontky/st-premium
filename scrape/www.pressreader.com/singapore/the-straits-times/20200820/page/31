No way, I don't want to scratch it. I'll just take photos of it and post them on social media! Can P1 registrati­on process be simplified? Banks should share ATMs The current Primary 1 registrati­on system has created unnecessar­y stress for parents by putting in so many complicate­d steps and phases.
A child of Singaporea­ns with no ties or affiliatio­ns with a school could end up being allowed to register only towards the last phases.
Why can’t there be just a simple process to allow parents to choose four primary schools upfront and allocate the children to one of them?
This way, a pupil would get at least one of his choices. Some parents just want our child to study at nearby schools.
Now, after an unsuccessf­ul applicatio­n for Phase 2C – even when one lives within a 1km radius of the school – parents are forced to choose from a very limited list of schools that have leftover vacancies.
And if this is also unsuccessf­ul, the poor child may end up at an unpopular school assigned by the Ministry of Education, and possibly one that is located far away from the pupil’s home.
With this system, we all know which are the unpopular schools. It has been said that “every school is a good school”, but why do we have a system that exposes the unpopular schools?
Would any parent want his child to start his academic life in an unpopular school? Ong Li Li Set up centralise­d pharmacies to send medication to patients’ homes patients’ registered addresses.
If such a system is workable for food delivery, I see no reason why it cannot be adapted to serve patients.
The volume of patients would justify having this delivery service.
It would, at the same time, help to minimise contact and crowds at clinics and hospitals.
Patients would wait less at clinics and hospitals, and be able to go home right after seeing the doctor. Bouquets Moved by bus driver’s kindness ethnic groups.
Despite leading a fast-paced life, Singaporea­ns have shown that they will put what they are doing aside to respond to a call for help.
This is something that we can be proud of as well as to celebrate. It seems that at most polyclinic­s these days, it takes a shorter time to see a doctor than to wait for the prescribed medication.
Amid efforts to minimise crowds and inconvenie­nce amid the Covid-19 situation, the Ministry of Health should also review the primary healthcare services administer­ed at polyclinic­s and various hospitals’ outpatient clinics.
I suggest setting up, for each cluster, a centralise­d pharmacy to dispense medication to patients from various clinics or hospitals, while they wait to receive it at home.
Each day, patients’ prescripti­ons would be transmitte­d online to this centralise­d pharmacy. The medication is then packed and batched for same-day delivery by courier if urgent, or by mail to the I was at the bus stop at 6:15am, Aug 13, in front of Block 205, Commonweal­th Avenue West, when bus service 963 pulled up.
It was raining heavily and there was a gap between the bus stop and the bus. The bus driver immediatel­y left his seat and told the people waiting to board the bus to wait. He then took out a big umbrella to shelter the people getting off and then those boarding the bus from the rain.
What a kind man. He certainly warmed the cockles of our hearts on such a cold and wet day. Lim Choo Beng Jeffrey Law Lee Beng Good job by NDP organising team Foreign workers in nursing warmly welcomed The efforts of the National Day organising committee are much appreciate­d.
The programme for the occasion brought much needed joy to Singaporea­ns amid the pandemic.
The gift pack was also very meaningful. It reminded me of the joy of Singapore being independen­t for 55 years and the sense of being united as one people.
Including the national flag in the pack was also a good idea.
It seemed like a lot more flags were displayed this year during the National Day period than in the past.
In future, instead of giving away fun packs only to parade spectators, gift packs should be distribute­d to all Singaporea­n households. The topic of discrimina­tory hiring practices in the banking and financial services sector has dominated discussion recently (47 employers added to watch list over discrimina­tory hiring, Aug 6).
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) should not have allowed this situation to happen. However, the actions it is taking now are a step in the right direction. Still, I would wholeheart­edly applaud the MOM if it issues work passes to foreigners who come here to work in essential services like nursing. This is one occupation that many Singaporea­ns have shunned.
I am a dialysis patient who undergoes thrice-weekly treatments. Of the nine nursing staff at the centre I go to, only one is a Singaporea­n. The rest are from Myanmar, Malaysia, China, the Philippine­s and India.
All these foreign nurses are very caring and dedicated, and provide good service to the majority of patients, who are mainly from the Pioneer or Merdeka Generation.
I was told that this centre has about 40 outlets island wide providing essential dialysis treatment to thousands of elderly Singaporea­ns. Without these foreign nurses, the care of dialysis patients would be compromise­d.
Singaporea­n should warmly welcome and appreciate the care and service provided by these foreign nurses. Phua Siew Hoon Proud of caring Singaporea­ns It is uplifting to know that there is no shortage of good Samaritans in our midst (They helped a senior and her son in stressful situation, Aug 17).
The incident at Jem shopping mall where a group of people banded together to help a male caregiver and his elderly mother in distress is a case in point.
What is more heartwarmi­ng is that the people who came forward to help were from all walks of life and from different Neo Poh Goon Living donor kidney transplant­s a good option for patients potential donors will come forward, and more patients will have their lives saved or transforme­d.

Singapore citizens and permanent residents who wish to donate to patients on the waiting list may also contact Notu at organ.transplant@notu.com.sg or call 6321-4390. kidney transplant­s online, including true stories featuring organ donors and transplant recipients.
Earlier this year, the National Organ Transplant Unit (Notu) collaborat­ed with the NKF to produce a short documentar­y featuring the journey of a kidney transplant recipient who opted for a living donor kidney transplant after being on dialysis for 10 years.
Organ donation is a noble gift of life that requires courage to give, and perhaps as much courage to receive. We hope that more transplant­s from deceased donors, those from living donors offer better outcomes and long-term survival for patients.
Prospectiv­e donors also undergo robust assessment­s to protect their safety and well-being, ensuring that they are medically and mentally fit for the donation.
Post-donation, annual checks are necessary to maintain the donor’s good health. Properly screened living kidney donors are expected to live as long as non-kidney donors.
The public may obtain more informatio­n on living donor We thank chief executive officer of the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Tim Oei for highlighti­ng kidney transplant­s as the first option for kidney failure (Kidney transplant is first option, Aug 14).
Last year, 56 Singapore citizens and permanent residents benefited from a living donor kidney transplant.
Living donor kidney transplant­s provide a better option for patients with end-stage kidney failure due to the better long-term survival rates than those who remain on dialysis.
