    <p>LIM HOCK CHEE, 59 Chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the Sheng Siong Group su­per­mar­ket chain</p>
    <p>While many busi­nesses were hit hard by the pan­demic, su­per­mar­kets not only sur­vived, but also thrived.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, when other re­tail out­lets were shut, they re­mained open and saw brisk sales from cus­tomers fre­net­i­cally stock­ing up on gro­ceries. More peo­ple cooking at home also re­sulted in in­gre­di­ents flying off the shelves.</p>
    <p>Sheng Siong Group’s 64 out­lets, lo­cated mainly in the heart­land, ben­e­fited from the un­prece­dented de­mand. Its on­line sales, too, peaked.</p>
    <p>The chain’s pub­lic­ity-shy chief ex­ec­u­tive, Mr Lim Hock Chee, de­clined to be in­ter­viewed for the Power List, but the com­pany that he founded in 1985 with el­der brother Lim Hock Eng and younger brother Lim Hock Leng re­port­edly posted a net profit of $31.8 mil­lion for its third quar­ter ended Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Its gross profit grew by 48 per cent from the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Sheng Siong even opened two new out­lets dur­ing the pe­riod – a 4,600 sq ft store in Po­tong Pasir Av­enue 2 and a 8,500 sq ft one in Tampines Street 86.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic-listed com­pany’s shares also did well and were among the top 50 stocks in Sin­ga­pore by turnover this year.</p>
    <p>Sales went down af­ter the cir­cuit breaker ended in June, but are still higher than pre-Covid-19 lev­els, with many con­tin­u­ing to work and cook at home.</p>
    <p>On the flip side, staffing costs inched up be­cause more hands were needed to cope with in­creased de­mand and en­force safe dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions at stores. Staff also re­ceived an ex­tra one-month bonus af­ter the firstquar­ter re­sults were an­nounced, as a ges­ture of thanks.</p>
    <p>But these added costs hardly dented prof­itabil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Hock Chee said in an ear­lier Busi­ness Times report: “Mov­ing ahead, we re­main ded­i­cated to our store ex­pan­sion plans by con­tin­u­ously look­ing for suit­able re­tail space, par­tic­u­larly in ar­eas where our cus­tomers re­side, but we do not have a pres­ence.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim’s for­tune is es­ti­mated to be worth more than $1 bil­lion, but he is known for his down-to-earth, thrifty ways and quiet, com­mu­ni­ty­based phi­lan­thropy.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Sheng Siong em­ploy­ees re­port­edly vis­ited ran­dom wakes of strangers near their out­lets and qui­etly slipped $200 into the col­lec­tion boxes.</p>
    <p>When ques­tioned at one of the wakes, one staff mem­ber said: “Our man­age­ment told us to walk around the es­tate and look out for wakes dur­ing this cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. And we would give a small fi­nan­cial con­tri­bu­tion.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman from the com­pany later ex­plained that this has been the com­pany’s prac­tice for more than 30 years and is its way of keep­ing the kam­pung spirit alive.</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier in­ter­view with The Straits Times, Mr Lim had said he be­lieves the cus­tomer is boss and pub­li­cises his mo­bile num­ber in stores so cus­tomers can call him with feed­back.</p>
    <p>“It means that if my staff did a good job, my phone won’t ring,” he added.</p>
    <p>He sel­dom goes down to the stores for spot checks, though.</p>
    <p>He rea­soned: “No need. All our work­ers are very hard-work­ing and we must have mu­tual trust.”</p>
    <p>Sheng Siong even opened two new out­lets dur­ing the pe­riod – a 4,600 sq ft store in Po­tong Pasir Av­enue 2 and a 8,500 sq ft one in Tampines Street 86.</p>
