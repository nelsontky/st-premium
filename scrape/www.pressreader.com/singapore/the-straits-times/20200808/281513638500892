    <p>The early-stage clin­i­cal trial for a Covid-19 vac­cine has started in Sin­ga­pore, with the first vac­ci­na­tions ex­pected to be given to vol­un­teers next week.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cians and re­searchers are now screen­ing those who have stepped for­ward to en­sure they are suit­able for the trial, which is ex­pected to last un­til Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The SingHealth In­ves­ti­ga­tional Medicine Unit is ad­min­is­ter­ing the trial for the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Called Lu­nar-Cov19, the vac­cine is de­vel­oped by DukeNUS Med­i­cal School and United States phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany</p>
    <p>Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Jenny Low, deputy clin­i­cal and sci­en­tific direc­tor at the SingHealth unit, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that more than 250 vol­un­teers have stepped for­ward for the trial.</p>
    <p>Around 100 peo­ple will take part in the trial. The vol­un­teers are in their 20s to 50s.</p>
    <p>“As the trial is open to vol­un­teers from 21 to 80 years old, we con­tinue to be on the look­out for more par­tic­i­pants, es­pe­cially those in the older age group,” she added.</p>
    <p>Prof Low said the vol­un­teer re­sponse for the vac­cine trial has been en­cour­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>“It shows that peo­ple are willing to con­trib­ute to­wards the ad­vance­ment of science, even if the trial may not ben­e­fit them di­rectly.”</p>
    <p>A vac­cine works by “show­ing” the im­mune sys­tem an im­por­tant part of the virus and “train­ing” it to recog­nise and re­mem­ber a pathogen without ex­pos­ing the pa­tient to the risk of dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tional vac­cines do this by in­ject­ing a killed or weak­ened form of the virus into the hu­man body so that the im­mune sys­tem recog­nises the in­vader and be­gins sum­mon­ing its “sol­diers” – an­ti­bod­ies and Tcells – to get rid of it.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Lu­nar-Cov19 vac­cine in­volves a newer type of biotech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine con­tains only frag­ments of the virus’ ge­netic ma­te­rial, in­stead of the whole virus.</p>
    <p>When these vi­ral ge­netic frag­ments en­ter the hu­man cell af­ter in­jec­tion, the genome frag­ments com­man­deer the cell to be­gin pro­duc­ing the sig­na­ture spike pro­tein of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>This trains the body to recog­nise a key part of the virus – the spike pro­tein – without ex­pos­ing it to the whole virus.</p>
    <p>Prof Low said the vac­cine had shown promis­ing pre-clin­i­cal re­sults, and the next step would be to en­sure it is safe, and that it can elicit a ro­bust an­ti­body and T-cell im­mu­nity in vac­ci­nated in­di­vid­u­als to con­fer long-last­ing pro­tec­tion against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The early-stage clin­i­cal trial for the Lu­nar-Cov19 be­ing con­ducted here is known in med­i­cal cir­cles as a phase I/II trial.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cally, a phase I vac­cine trial in­volves a small num­ber of sub­jects, usu­ally fewer than 100.</p>
    <p>They are re­cruited to eval­u­ate the dif­fer­ent doses of a vac­cine for po­ten­tial tox­i­c­ity, and to un­der­stand how drugs are re­moved from the body. The body’s im­mune re­sponse will also be mea­sured.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus of phase II is sim­i­lar, ex­cept the num­ber of sub­jects is usu­ally in­creased to sev­eral hun­dreds.</p>
    <p>Prof Low said that com­bin­ing phases I and II for this trial will al­low for greater flex­i­bil­ity and help to speed up the trial without any gaps in time af­ter phase I.</p>
    <p>She added: “This is im­por­tant dur­ing a pan­demic such as Covid-19, where the search for a vac­cine is crit­i­cal to sav­ing lives and should be ac­cel­er­ated where pos­si­ble without com­pro­mis­ing on safety.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore a clin­i­cal trial is al­lowed to take place, many mea­sures have to be in place to en­sure the safety of a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes hav­ing ex­perts con­duct ex­ten­sive pre-clin­i­cal tests, such as lab­o­ra­tory tests, an­i­mal stud­ies and safety tests.</p>
    <p>A vac­cine can move into the clin­i­cal trial stage only when promis­ing pre-clin­i­cal re­sults are shown, Prof Low said.</p>
    <p>The tri­als are also tightly reg­u­lated by both ethics and reg­u­la­tory boards, and close safety mon­i­tor­ing takes place at every phase.</p>
    <p>The Lu­nar-Cov19 vac­cine is one of 26 vac­cine can­di­dates world­wide that ei­ther have been tested on hu­mans or have re­ceived ap­proval to do so.</p>
    <p>Some 139 oth­ers are still at a pre­clin­i­cal phase.</p>
    <p>“As one of the vac­cine can­di­dates in the world that has reached the clin­i­cal eval­u­a­tion stage, this trial is def­i­nitely sig­nif­i­cant for Sin­ga­pore,” said Prof Low, who is also a se­nior con­sul­tant at the depart­ment of in­fec­tious dis­eases at the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“If the vac­cine is ef­fi­ca­cious, Sin­ga­pore would have played a key role in the global search for a Covid-19 vac­cine, and hope­fully be able to help find a so­lu­tion to the cur­rent pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will also have pri­or­ity ac­cess to the vac­cine for its pop­u­la­tion, Prof Low added.</p>
    <p>The next phase of the trial – phase III – will look into find­ing out if the vac­cine re­duces the oc­cur­rence of a par­tic­u­lar dis­ease.</p>
    <p>ST had ear­lier re­ported that phase III of the clin­i­cal de­vel­op­ment process in­volves in­oc­u­lat­ing a much larger pool of thou­sands of vol­un­teers in Sin­ga­pore and abroad, and that this could start be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Those in­ter­ested in tak­ing part in the trial can con­tact the SingHealth In­ves­ti­ga­tional Medicine Unit at imu@singhealth.com.sg or call 6323-7544/8318-0685.</p>
