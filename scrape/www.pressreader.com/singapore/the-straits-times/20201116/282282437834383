    <p>Allen & Gled­hill is the only law firm to be ranked in all 15 cat­e­gories of the in­au­gu­ral list of the ST Best Law Firms 2021.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, done jointly with Ger­man re­search firm Statista, iden­ti­fied, for the first time, Sin­ga­pore’s front run­ners in 15 cat­e­gories of le­gal prac­tice rang­ing from bank­ing and neg­li­gence law to crim­i­nal and com­mer­cial law, as rec­om­mended by their peers and users.</p>
    <p>Allen & Gled­hill ob­tained five-star rat­ings in 10 out of the 15 cat­e­gories, in­clud­ing bank­ing and fi­nance, merg­ers and ac­qui­si­tions and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty law.</p>
    <p>Col­le­giate Big Four law firms Ra­jah & Tann and WongPart­ner­ship were ranked in 14 and 13 out of the to­tal 15 cat­e­gories, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Allen & Gled­hill’s joint man­ag­ing part­ner, Mr Jerry Koh, said: “We are hum­bled to be recog­nised as one of the best law firms in Sin­ga­pore by our clients and friends. Their faith in our ca­pa­bil­i­ties has al­lowed us to con­stantly raise the bar and push bound­aries in le­gal in­no­va­tion as we seek to de­liver the most favourable out­comes for them.”</p>
    <p>Allen & Gled­hill was founded in 1902 and is one of the lead­ing and largest full-ser­vice law firms in South-east Asia. It has, in the cur­rent era, pro­duced two sit­ting law min­is­ters, the present At­tor­ney-Gen­eral and a serv­ing High Court judge, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“Many of our part­ners are recog­nised as thought lead­ers in their fields and are reg­u­larly con­sulted by the reg­u­la­tors, sig­nif­i­cant in­dus­try bod­ies and lead­ing play­ers in pro­mot­ing or en­hanc­ing leg­is­la­tion in Sin­ga­pore,” said Mr Koh.</p>
    <p>The firm was in­volved in a num­ber of high-pro­file, high-value, in­no­va­tive and cross-bor­der mat­ters that took place in Sin­ga­pore in the past year.</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cant mat­ters where the firm acted as trans­ac­tion coun­sel or ad­vised on re­cently in­clude the $8.27 bil­lion pro­posed merger of CapitaLand Mall Trust and CapitaLand Com­mer­cial Trust to form the third-largest real es­tate in­vest­ment trust (Reit) in Asia-Pa­cific. The merged en­tity is also ex­pected to be the largest Reit in Sin­ga­pore, with a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of $16.8 bil­lion and a com­bined prop­erty value of $22.9 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“Our (re­gional) net­work brings to­gether over 600 lawyers with ex­ten­sive ex­pe­ri­ence in deal­ing with all man­ner of trans­ac­tions across mul­ti­ple ju­ris­dic­tions and prac­tice ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“We are con­stantly look­ing to im­prove our ca­pa­bil­i­ties and bring our clients the best le­gal ser­vices in the re­gion,” said Mr Koh.</p>
