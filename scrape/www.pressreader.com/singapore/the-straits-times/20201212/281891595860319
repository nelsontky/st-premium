    <p>• In a show of de­fi­ance, Bei­jing sent a top of­fi­cial sanc­tioned by the US to an an­nual din­ner hosted by the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce (AmCham) in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment was rep­re­sented at the AmCham event on Thurs­day by Mr Wang Chen, a mem­ber of the Com­mu­nist Party’s Polit­buro. Mr Wang is also vicechair­man of the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress and among 14 of­fi­cials sanc­tioned by the US on Mon­day over the body’s role in con­strain­ing free­doms in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>China of­ten des­ig­nates a rep­re­sen­ta­tive with an eco­nom­i­cally fo­cused port­fo­lio, such as Vice-Premier Hu Chun­hua, the guest at last year’s din­ner. Mr Wang spent much of his ca­reer in var­i­ous pro­pa­ganda roles, in­clud­ing a stint as ed­i­tor-in-chief of the Peo­ple’s Daily, the party’s top mouth­piece.</p>
    <p>“Other de­vel­op­ments this week in­volved po­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions, of which we’re not a part,” AmCham China chair­man Greg Gil­li­gan said in an e-mailed state­ment, re­fer­ring to the tit-for-tat sanc­tions im­posed on of­fi­cials from both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“We are an in­de­pen­dent or­gan­i­sa­tion that aims to be a com­mer­cial bridge on be­half of our mem­bers be­tween the US and China.”</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the US Em­bassy de­clined to com­ment on Mr Wang’s at­ten­dance, adding that no one from the em­bassy at­tended the event due to last-minute Covid-19 test­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang said Bei­jing would con­tinue to cre­ate a favourable busi­ness en­vi­ron­ment for for­eign firms and “treat all en­ter­prises reg­is­tered in China equally”, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by state-run CGTN.</p>
    <p>He said he hoped AmCham could play an ac­tive role in fa­cil­i­tat­ing the two coun­tries in “re-launch­ing dia­logue, re­turn­ing to nor­mal tracks and re­build­ing mu­tual trust”.</p>
    <p>The ap­pear­ance by such an of­fi­cial at an AmCham event could feed crit­i­cism in Wash­ing­ton that the US busi­ness com­mu­nity has not suf­fi­ciently de­fended broader Amer­i­can in­ter­ests while pur­su­ing ac­cess to the Chi­nese mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Ministry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing said Mr Wang was in­vited by AmCham. “This just shows that the so-called sanc­tions by the US are un­pop­u­lar and will not be sup­ported by all sec­tors of the US,” Ms Hua told a reg­u­lar news brief­ing.</p>
