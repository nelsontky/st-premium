    <p>With more than 200 po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cines be­ing de­vel­oped glob­ally, the world is in­un­dated each day with news of the lat­est developmen­ts.</p>
    <p>How to sift through the vast amount of in­for­ma­tion, to guide the press­ing de­ci­sions on which vac­cines to buy or use?</p>
    <p>To put to­gether Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 vac­cine port­fo­lio, an ex­pert com­mit­tee re­viewed more than 40 vac­cine can­di­dates over the past seven months. This in­volved more than a hun­dred meet­ings with com­pa­nies and aca­demics, and a de­tailed study of thou­sands of pages of sci­en­tific pa­pers, in­dus­try re­ports and pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>BAL­ANC­ING A VAC­CINE PORT­FO­LIO</p>
    <p>Covid-19 fu­elled the de­vel­op­ment of an un­prece­dented num­ber of vac­cine plat­forms, some of which have never been ap­proved for use in hu­mans.</p>
    <p>These in­clude tra­di­tional and well-tested ap­proaches us­ing in­ac­ti­vated whole viruses or frag­ments of virus pro­tein, newer tech­nolo­gies em­ploy­ing nu­cleic acids (RNA or DNA) and vi­ral vec­tors (rid­ing on an­other virus to de­liver a pay­load of coro­n­avirus RNA to the im­mune sys­tem).</p>
    <p>From the out­set, it was im­por­tant to ad­dress mul­ti­ple con­cerns.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes which tech­nolo­gies make bet­ter vac­cines, which are safer, which will be­come avail­able ear­lier, and which are eas­ier to man­u­fac­ture, given that bil­lions of doses are needed to pro­tect en­tire pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>There are al­ready front run­ners at­tain­ing reg­u­la­tory ap­proval for con­di­tional or emer­gency use.</p>
    <p>These, how­ever, may not even­tu­ally end up as the “best-in-class” in terms of safety or ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>There are also con­cerns of vac­cine na­tion­al­ism, and fears that the ex­port of vac­cines may be stopped by gov­ern­ments and redi­rected to deal with their do­mes­tic sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Any vac­cine port­fo­lio has to be based on ro­bust sci­en­tific and clin­i­cal ev­i­dence, and be ad­e­quately di­ver­si­fied to ad­dress po­lit­i­cal and op­er­a­tional con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>DISSECTING THE EV­I­DENCE</p>
    <p>With ev­ery com­pany in the race pre­sent­ing its own ver­sion of a vac­cine, it can be chal­leng­ing to choose the best.</p>
    <p>The pri­mary con­sid­er­a­tion is whether a par­tic­u­lar vac­cine is safe to use.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines prepare the hu­man body to fend off a real in­fec­tion, and it is not un­com­mon for some peo­ple to ex­pe­ri­ence fever or sore­ness at the in­jec­tion site, though they tend to re­cover quickly. What may be of con­cern are the rare cases of se­ri­ous re­ac­tions caused by the vac­cine or the body’s im­mune re­sponse. Some events are so rare that tens, if not hun­dreds,</p>
    <p>of thou­sands of peo­ple need to re­ceive the vac­cine be­fore this hap­pens.</p>
    <p>So there is a need to weigh the risks of in­fec­tion from Covid-19 against the rare like­li­hood of harm from vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other im­por­tant con­sid­er­a­tion is how well the vac­cine works.</p>
    <p>One way to mea­sure this is the po­tency of an­ti­body re­sponse.</p>
    <p>An­ti­bod­ies are pro­teins pro­duced by the body that tar­get and neu­tralise the virus. It is gen­er­ally thought that the higher the level of such “neu­tral­is­ing an­ti­bod­ies”, the bet­ter the pro­tec­tion pro­vided.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines also work by ac­ti­vat­ing im­mune cells which play dif­fer­ent roles.</p>
    <p>Some im­mune cells help with the con­tin­u­ous pro­duc­tion of an­ti­bod­ies, lead­ing to longer-last­ing pro­tec­tion, while oth­ers trig­ger “killer cells” which seek out and de­stroy virus-in­fected cells.</p>
    <p>A de­tailed study of how the im­mune sys­tem re­sponds to a vac­cine al­lows us to pre­dict its ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>Pre­clin­i­cal stud­ies, con­ducted in a lab­o­ra­tory us­ing an­i­mal mod­els, pro­vide us with a glimpse of how the vac­cine may per­form i n hu­mans. Ideally, vac­ci­nated an­i­mals achieve “ster­il­is­ing im­mu­nity”, where the im­mune re­sponse is po­tent enough to get rid of the virus com­pletely.</p>
    <p>Vac­cines that show prom­ise pro­ceed to hu­man clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>In clin­i­cal tri­als, both the safety and ef­fi­cacy of the vac­cine are mon­i­tored closely.</p>
    <p>These com­pare out­comes in peo­ple who re­ceive the vac­cine with those who re­ceive a placebo. At the con­clu­sion of the trial, the vac­cine group should have far fewer cases of disease com­pared with the placebo group.</p>
    <p>Re­cent re­ports show that both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vac­cines can achieve a pro­tec­tion rate of about 95 per cent, which means that most peo­ple who get vac­ci­nated will not get Covid-19, although there is a chance that they can still pass the virus on to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>It is also im­por­tant to find out how long the pro­tec­tion lasts.</p>
    <p>Many re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients con­tinue to have an­ti­bod­ies in their blood even six months later.</p>
    <p>To de­ter­mine how long the vac­cine pro­tec­tion lasts, clin­i­cal tri­als need to con­tinue for at least two years.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, clin­i­cal tri­als eval­u­ate how well a vac­cine works across dif­fer­ent age groups, par­tic­u­larly the elderly, as well as pa­tients with pre-ex­ist­ing dis­eases.</p>
    <p>PRAC­TI­CAL CON­SID­ER­A­TIONS</p>
    <p>Be­yond lab­o­ra­tory tests and clin­i­cal tri­als, there are prac­ti­cal is­sues to grap­ple with.</p>
    <p>The track record of the com­pany is im­por­tant, in­clud­ing whether it has the re­sources and ex­pe­ri­ence to con­duct multi-cen­tre tri­als across con­ti­nents, in­volv­ing tens of thou­sands of par­tic­i­pants; and its abil­ity to scale up man­u­fac­tur­ing, and dis­trib­ute vac­cines glob­ally.</p>
    <p>There are com­pa­nies with vac­cine can­di­dates backed by won­der­ful sci­ence, but lack­ing the means to take them all the way to the clinic.</p>
    <p>Some vac­cines re­quire two or more doses, while a se­lect few claim that a sin­gle dose pro­vides ad­e­quate pro­tec­tion. Oth­ers re­quire con­tents from dif­fer­ent vials to be</p>
    <p>mixed just prior to vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>With the need to ad­min­is­ter mil­lions of doses, each ad­di­tional step cre­ates its own set of chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>We also need to con­sider lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of vac­cines are un­sta­ble at room tem­per­a­ture and have to be shipped and stored at tem­per­a­tures as low as mi­nus 70 deg C.</p>
    <p>This re­quires the set-up of an ul­tra-low-tem­per­a­ture freezer farm to house the vac­cines, and tightly co­or­di­nated milk runs to dis­trib­ute them to vac­ci­na­tion sites.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, vac­cines, be­ing bi­o­log­i­cal prod­ucts, have a lim­ited shelf life. This de­ter­mines how long they can be kept if not used im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Through a sys­tem­atic process of ex­pert re­view and eval­u­a­tion, the long list of vac­cine can­di­dates has even­tu­ally been whit­tled down to a hand­ful.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nal port­fo­lio bal­ances con­sid­er­a­tions of safety, ef­fi­cacy, time­li­ness, ac­ces­si­bil­ity and im­ple­mentabil­ity, while mit­i­gat­ing risks of fail­ure.</p>
    <p>This re­quired close scru­tiny of what was pub­lished, read­ing be­tween the lines of what was not, and mak­ing tough calls based on the best avail­able ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Developmen­ts over the com­ing months will de­ter­mine whether the right choices were made.</p>
    <p>Many re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients con­tinue to have an­ti­bod­ies in their blood even six months later. To de­ter­mine how long the vac­cine pro­tec­tion lasts, clin­i­cal tri­als need to con­tinue for at least two years.</p>
    <p>tein sub-unit vac­cines, and do not make use of viruses, dead or live.</p>
    <p>Q Is it bet­ter to get im­mu­nity from a nat­u­ral in­fec­tion rather than through vac­ci­na­tion?</p>
    <p>A Both sce­nar­ios can pro­duce high­qual­ity im­mune pro­tec­tion. How­ever, with nat­u­ral in­fec­tion, there is a risk of devel­op­ing se­ri­ous and po­ten­tially life-threat­en­ing ill­ness, par­tic­u­larly for the elderly and those with pre-ex­ist­ing dis­eases like di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>A small num­ber of in­di­vid­u­als may also de­velop “long Covid”, where they ex­pe­ri­ence chronic symp­toms in­clud­ing short­ness of breath, headaches and even dam­age to the heart, lungs and kid­neys. This con­di­tion is not fully un­der­stood, and there is no stan­dard treat­ment.</p>
    <p>It is also un­likely for en­tire pop­u­la­tions to achieve herd im­mu­nity through nat­u­ral in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Even in hard-hit com­mu­ni­ties, stud­ies have shown that less than 10 per cent of peo­ple show im­mu­nity against Covid-19, which means that the re­main­der con­tinue to be vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>Q If I get vac­ci­nated, does it mean that I no longer need to wear a mask?</p>
    <p>A It is im­por­tant to con­tinue wear­ing a mask to pro­tect the peo­ple around you. Be­ing vac­ci­nated greatly re­duces your risk of devel­op­ing symp­to­matic Covid-19 disease, as well as the chance of get­ting se­vere disease. How­ever, it may not stop you from get­ting in­fected with­out show­ing symp­toms, or from spread­ing the virus to your fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>Are vac­cine com­pa­nies im­plant­ing mi­crochips into our bod­ies to con­trol us?</p>
    <p>A There are those who be­lieve that in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies are in al­liance to in­cor­po­rate mi­crochips into vac­cines, in an at­tempt to track who has been vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>In more sen­sa­tional ver­sions of this hoax, there are claims that 5G net­works and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence will send sig­nals to these mi­crochips to con­trol hu­man be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>While we are un­able to es­tab­lish the ori­gins of this false­hood, it pre­dates Covid-19 by al­most a decade. Hoax­ers tend to look for old sto­ries and adapt them to the current sit­u­a­tion to make the lies seem more con­vinc­ing.</p>
    <p>What we know is that cer­tain vac­cines con­tain metal salts, typ­i­cally alu­minium phos­phate or alu­minium hy­drox­ide, to en­hance the im­mune re­sponse. Such ad­ju­vants – added to vac­cines to im­prove im­mune re­sponse – have been used safely in vac­cines for more than 60 years.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine ad­ju­vants can­not be tracked or con­trolled by 5G.</p>
    <p>In fact, mo­bile phones make bet­ter track­ing de­vices that al­ready con­trol hu­man be­hav­iour.</p>
