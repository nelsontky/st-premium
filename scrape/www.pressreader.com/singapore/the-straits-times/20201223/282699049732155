    <p>PHENOUMENO­N 360</p>
    <p>T.H.E Dance Com­pany</p>
    <p>Good­man Arts Cen­tre, last Thurs­day</p>
    <p>The mo­ment I walk into the stu­dio at Good­man Arts Cen­tre, I catch a whiff of a sharp, earthy scent.</p>
    <p>This is t h e s me l l o f P h e - Noumenon 360, cre­ated for the com­pany by Je­taime Per­fumery.</p>
    <p>I am handed a bun­dle of or­ange cloth, the same ma­te­rial the dancers’ cos­tumes are made of. In­side is a vir­tual-re­al­ity head­set, a vial of the per­fume, ear­phones and a con­troller that is trig­gered by the crook of a fin­ger.</p>
    <p>PheNoumeno­n, chore­ographed by T.H.E Dance Com­pany’s artis­tic di­rec­tor Kuik Swee Boon, had its live pre­miere a year ago at the Es­planade The­atre Stu­dio.</p>
    <p>The au­di­ence could sit and stand al­most any­where they liked as or­ange-clad dancers pulsed, yelled and rushed around them.</p>
    <p>It was i ntense, i nti­mate and, above all, i mmer­sive, break­ing new ground for Kuik’s “hollow body” move­ment tech­nique.</p>
    <p>With live per­for­mances af­fected by the pan­demic, T.H.E has taken the un­prece­dented step of trans­form­ing PheNoumeno­n into Sin­ga­pore’s first full-length 360-de­gree vir­tual-re­al­ity dance production.</p>
    <p>It was shot over four days from dif­fer­ent au­di­ence view­points in col­lab­o­ra­tion with im­mer­sive tech­nol­ogy provider Hiver­lab.</p>
    <p>The first op­tion the head­set of­fers is “ex­plo­ration”. I can take my pick of five pre-recorded lo­ca­tions, sit­ting or stand­ing, within the vir­tual the­atre.</p>
    <p>This is fol­lowed by a choice of watch­ing an 11-minute ex­cerpt or the full per­for­mance. The fi­nal choice is “scene se­lec­tion”, i n which the dance’s var­i­ous chap­ters can be ex­pe­ri­enced from two or more lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>I choose to watch the full-length work. It is rec­om­mended that view­ers take a break ev­ery 20 min­utes.</p>
    <p>I find, how­ever, that if I sup­port the head­set with one hand, re­mov­ing the dis­com­fort of its weight press­ing against my head, I am able to watch with­out a break.</p>
    <p>Com­pared to the orig­i­nal live ver­sion, PheNoumeno­n 360 fore­grounds the episodic na­ture of the dance.</p>
    <p>Rather than be­ing dis­rup­tive, the breaks between scenes be­come op­por­tune mo­ments to rest my eyes by clos­ing them or tak­ing a few slow blinks.</p>
    <p>In the full-length ver­sion, Kuik’s cu­ra­to­rial choices are ap­par­ent. I am seam­lessly trans­ported to a dif­fer­ent van­tage point for each chap­ter, but it soon be­comes clear that these are in­deed the best po­si­tions from which to ex­pe­ri­ence the show.</p>
    <p>There is no fear of mak­ing a bad choice, be­cause no po­si­tions with a poor per­spec­tive would have been loaded in the first place.</p>
    <p>Even if you re­gret your choice, you can al­ways pause and choose again, or flit between ev­ery sin­gle van­tage point of­fered.</p>
    <p>The at­ten­tion to de­tail in try­ing to re­cre­ate the orig­i­nal im­mer­sive ex­pe­ri­ence goes be­yond be­ing able to watch dancers up close next to you or see­ing other mem­bers of the au­di­ence no mat­ter which way your head turns.</p>
    <p>Even the sounds of breath­ing and the squeak of shoes are unique to your recorded van­tage point and change with each new per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>In many ways, this ver­sion stays true to the im­mer­sive qual­ity and idea of choice of­fered by the live for­mat – and, in fact, I get a much bet­ter view.</p>
    <p>It is tempt­ing to say this is the fu­ture of dance. There are many ben­e­fits to this pre­sen­ta­tion for­mat, such as be­ing able to take the show to peo­ple who are un­able to leave their homes or re­duc­ing the cost of in­ter­na­tional tour­ing.</p>
    <p>T.H.E has plans for is­land­wide pop-ups and even a home-rental model for the head­sets.</p>
    <p>But, un­less you can ac­cept the dis­con­nect between your vis­ual and au­di­tory senses and the rest of your body, you might ex­pe­ri­ence some phys­i­cal dis­com­fort.</p>
    <p>Yet, as tech­nol­ogy im­proves, vir­tual ex­pe­ri­ences will only get bet­ter. This com­pany has the drive and rigour to make the most of it.</p>
