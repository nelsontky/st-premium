    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans who want to ap­point some­one to make de­ci­sions on their be­half, should they be­come men­tally in­ca­pac­i­tated, may soon be able to ap­ply for the le­gal document on­line through a pro­posed por­tal by the Of­fice of the Pub­lic Guardian.</p>
    <p>This will of­fer greater con­ve­nience to ap­pli­cants and re­duce the time needed to get a Last­ing Power of At­tor­ney (LPA) regis­tered.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF) is propos­ing to amend the Men­tal Ca­pac­ity Act to al­low for the LPA to be regis­tered elec­tron­i­cally through its new sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The min­istry is seek­ing pub­lic feed­back on the pro­posed amend­ments till Nov 18.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, in­di­vid­u­als have to sign and sub­mit hard-copy doc­u­ments to ap­ply for the LPA.</p>
    <p>With the pro­posed Of­fice of the Pub­lic Guardian On­line Elec­tronic Sys­tem, the time needed to reg­is­ter an LPA will be short­ened from the cur­rent av­er­age of three weeks to eight work­ing days.</p>
    <p>This ex­cludes the manda­tory three-week wait­ing pe­riod un­der the law, dur­ing which a per­son can with­draw his ap­pli­ca­tion and the per­son ap­pointed to act on his be­half can also raise ob­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>There will be var­i­ous safe­guards in place to en­sure that a per­son is not ap­ply­ing for an LPA un­der duress and un­der­stands what he is do­ing.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, he has to ap­pear in per­son be­fore the LPA cer­tifi­cate is­suer, such as a doc­tor or a lawyer, to sign the LPA.</p>
    <p>The new on­line sys­tem is ex­pected to be ready in the sec­ond half of next year.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed amend­ments will also bet­ter pro­tect those who have made an LPA.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, if there are grounds to sus­pect that a per­son was tricked or pres­sured into ap­point­ing a par­tic­u­lar per­son to act on his be­half, the pro­posed amend­ments will al­low the Pub­lic Guardian to in­ter­view the per­son mak­ing the LPA.</p>
    <p>The Pub­lic Guardian may also take other ac­tions, such as ap­ply­ing to the court to de­ter­mine if the LPA should be regis­tered.</p>
    <p>Last year, 28,789 LPA ap­pli­ca­tions were re­ceived, the MSF spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The Of­fice of the Pub­lic Guardian will part­ner var­i­ous gov­ern­ment and com­mu­nity agen­cies to as­sist those who may be less dig­i­tally savvy to ap­ply for an LPA.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic can re­fer to de­tails of the amend­ments on gov­ern­ment e-con­sul­ta­tion por­tal Reach, and e-mail their feed­back to con­sul­ta­tions@msf.gov.sg</p>
