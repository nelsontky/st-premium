    <p>NEW YORK • Drug firms in­clud­ing Pfizer, Sanofi and Glax­oSmithK­line were plan­ning to raise prices on more than 300 drugs in the United States on Jan 1, ac­cord­ing to drug­mak­ers and data an­a­lysed by health­care re­search firm 3 Axis Ad­vi­sors.</p>
    <p>The hikes come as drug­mak­ers reel from t he ef­fects of t he Covid-19 pan­demic, which has re­duced doc­tor vis­its and de­mand for some drugs.</p>
    <p>They are also fight­ing new drug price cut­ting rules from the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, which would re­duce the in­dus­try’s prof­itabil­ity.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies had kept their price hikes at 10 per cent or be­low, and the largest drug com­pa­nies to raise prices so far, Pfizer and Sanofi, kept nearly all of their in­creases at 5 per cent or less, said 3 Axis, a con­sult­ing firm that works with phar­ma­cist groups, health plans and foun­da­tions on drug pric­ing and sup­ply chain is­sues.</p>
    <p>GSK did raise prices on two vac­cines – Shin­grix for shin­gles and Pe­di­arix for diph­the­ria, tetanus and per­tus­sis – by 7 per cent and 8.6 per cent, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Teva Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals raised prices on 15 drugs, in­clud­ing Austedo, which treats rare neu­ro­log­i­cal dis­or­ders, and asthma steroid Qvar, which to­gether grossed more than US$650 mil­lion (S$859 mil­lion) in sales in 2019 and saw price hikes of be­tween 5 per cent and 6 per cent.</p>
    <p>Teva hiked prices for some drugs, in­clud­ing mus­cle re­lax­ant Am­rix and nar­colepsy drug Nu­vigil, by as much as 9.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>More price hikes were ex­pected to be an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Drug­mak­ers last year raised prices on more than 860 drugs by around 5 per cent on av­er­age, ac­cord­ing to 3 Axis. Drug price in­creases have slowed sub­stan­tially since 2015, both in terms of the size of the hikes and the num­ber of drugs af­fected.</p>
    <p>The in­creases come as phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies like Pfizer are play­ing hero by de­vel­op­ing vac­cines for Covid-19 in record time. The hikes could help make up for lost rev­enue as vis­its to doc­tors and new pre­scrip­tions plum­meted dur­ing the global lock­down.</p>
    <p>Pfizer plans to raise prices on more than 60 drugs by be­tween 0.5 per cent and 5 per cent. Those in­clude 5 per cent hikes on some of its top sellers like rheuma­toid arthri­tis treat­ment Xel­janz and cancer drugs Ibrance and In­lyta.</p>
    <p>Pfizer said it had ad­justed the list prices of its drugs by around 1.3 per cent across all prod­ucts in its port­fo­lio, in line with in­fla­tion.</p>
    <p>“This mod­est in­crease is nec­es­sary to sup­port in­vest­ments that al­low us to con­tinue to dis­cover new medicines and de­liver those break­throughs to the pa­tients who need them,” spokesman Amy Rose said, point­ing in par­tic­u­lar to the Covid-19 vac­cine the firm de­vel­oped with Ger­many’s BioNTech.</p>
    <p>It said that its net prices, which back out re­bates to phar­macy ben­e­fit man­agers and other dis­counts, have fallen for the past three years.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, France’s Sanofi plans to in­crease prices on a num­ber of vac­cines by 5 per cent or less and will an­nounce more price in­creases later this month, said spokesman Ash­leigh Koss.</p>
    <p>None of the com­pany’s price in­creases will be above the ex­pected growth rate of US health spend­ing of 5.1 per cent, she added.</p>
    <p>Slash­ing US pre­scrip­tion drug prices – among the world’s high­est – was a fo­cus of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who made it part of the core pledge of his 2016 cam­paign.</p>
    <p>He is­sued sev­eral ex­ec­u­tive or­ders late last year meant to cut prices, but their im­pact could be limited by le­gal challenges and other prob­lems. A fed­eral judge last month blocked a last-minute Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion rule aimed at low­er­ing drug prices that was set to be im­ple­mented at the be­gin­ning of this year. It was chal­lenged by drug in­dus­try groups in­clud­ing PhRMA, the na­tion’s lead­ing phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal trade group.</p>
