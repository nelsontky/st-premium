    <p>A teenager was charged in a district court yes­ter­day over his al­leged in­volve­ment in a knife at­tack at a FairPrice out­let in Boon Lay ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>James Teck Jing You, 18, who ap­peared in court via video link, is ac­cused of one count of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing griev­ous hurt with a weapon.</p>
    <p>The at­tack, which took place at the su­per­mar­ket at Block 221 Boon Lay Place at around 12.40pm on Wed­nes­day, left Mr Lee Jing Wen, 23, with in­juries to his face.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Thurs­day, the po­lice said: “Through ground in­quiries and with the aid of CCTV (closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion) footage, of­fi­cers from Jurong Po­lice Di­vi­sion es­tab­lished the iden­tity of the sus­pect and ar­rested him on the same day.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee was given med­i­cal as­sis­tance at the scene be­fore an am­bu­lance rushed him to Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>A Boon Lay res­i­dent in his 40s had ear­lier said that he was shop­ping at the su­per­mar­ket on Wed­nes­day when he heard “loud shout­ing” nearby.</p>
    <p>The man, who de­clined to be named, added that he then spot­ted a young man cov­ered in blood.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the su­per­mar­ket was closed for sev­eral hours af­ter the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>A FairPrice spokesman said in an ear­lier state­ment: “Our staff ren­dered im­me­di­ate as­sis­tance and en­sured that the safety of our shop­pers was not com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>“Our store oper­a­tions re­main unaf­fected.”</p>
    <p>Teck will be re­manded in the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health for psy­chi­atric ob­ser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>The case has been ad­journed to Oct 23.</p>
    <p>An of­fender convicted of vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing griev­ous hurt with a dan­ger­ous weapon can ei­ther be jailed for life or jailed for up to 15 years and caned.</p>
