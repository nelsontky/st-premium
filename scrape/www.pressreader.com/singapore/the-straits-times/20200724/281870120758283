    <p>SEOUL • South Korea should post­pone mil­i­tary ex­er­cises with the United States in the hope of draw­ing North Korea back into talks, the South Korean politi­cian set to take over re­spon­si­bil­ity for re­la­tions with the North said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in wants to get di­a­logue with North Korea back on track af­ter ne­go­ti­a­tions be­tween the US and North Korea on the North’s nu­clear pro­gramme broke down.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar mil­i­tary ex­er­cises be­tween South Korean and US forces have for years in­fu­ri­ated North Korea, which sees the drills as prepa­ra­tions for its in­va­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee In-young, who has been nom­i­nated as South Korea’s next uni­fi­ca­tion min­is­ter, said post­pon­ing, or at least scal­ing back, the ex­er­cises, which are due to start next month, might con­vince North Korea to re­con­sider ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“If the ex­er­cises take place as planned, North Korea’s backlash will be strong, but if they are com­pletely post­poned, it might take it as a fresh mes­sage,” Mr Lee told a par­lia­men­tary con­fir­ma­tion hear­ing. “If we can show flex­i­bil­ity by scal­ing it back by around half or mov­ing its lo­ca­tion far­ther south, North Korea would re­spond ac­cord­ingly.”</p>
    <p>South Korea and the US are dis­cussing the scale, scope and tim­ing of the an­nual drills now that the coro­n­avirus out­break has dis­rupted the travel of US troops.</p>
    <p>Ques­tions over the ex­er­cises come af­ter a pe­riod of ris­ing ten­sion with the North, which ap­pears in­creas­ingly frus­trated that talks with both South Korea and the US, in­clud­ing three meet­ings be­tween North Korean l eader Kim Jong Un and US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump since 2018, have brought no eas­ing of sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Last month, North Korea blew up a joint li­ai­son of­fice on its side of the bor­der, sev­ered hot­lines with South Korea and threat­ened mil­i­tary ac­tion, an­gry about de­fec­tor groups send­ing anti-North pro­pa­ganda leaflets.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has in the past ques­tioned the value of the drills, and in 2018 even sug­gested to Mr Kim that he would end them.</p>
    <p>There are about 28,000 US troops in South Korea.</p>
    <p>PRE­VENT­ING A BACKLASH</p>
    <p>If the ex­er­cises take place as planned, North Korea’s backlash will be strong, but if they are com­pletely post­poned, it might take ’’ it as a fresh mes­sage.</p>
    <p>MR LEE IN-YOUNG, on South Korea’s mil­i­tary ex­er­cises with the US next month.</p>
