    <p>It was fond mem­o­ries of fam­ily din­ners – rather than just busi­ness plan­ning or en­tre­pre­neur­ial am­bi­tion – that led to the cre­ation of The 1925 Brew­ing Co.</p>
    <p>Brothers Yeo Eng Kuang, 35, and Ivan Yeo, 39, the duo be­hind the suc­cess­ful mi­cro­brew­ery and restau­rant busi­ness, re­mem­bered with fond­ness those evenings when they would drink their un­cle’s home-brewed beer and feast on au­then­tic Teochew cui­sine.</p>
    <p>This was the im­pe­tus be­hind them set­ting up their busi­ness and nam­ing it The 1925 Brew­ing Co, to cel­e­brate the birth year of the fam­ily pa­tri­arch Yeo Kim Ho, who was a dry goods gro­cer.</p>
    <p>“At the time, it was def­i­nitely a risky move. Our fam­ily was con­cerned, es­pe­cially when the food and bev­er­age busi­ness was so volatile,” Mr Yeo Eng Kuang told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness was founded by the Yeo brothers and their un­cle Yeo King Joey in Novem­ber 2013.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, they were among 48 pi­o­neer re­cip­i­ents of t he “Made With Pas­sion” Sin­ga­pore brand mark.</p>
    <p>In May 2014, the Yeo brothers first be­gan restau­rant op­er­a­tions in what Mr Yeo Eng Kuang now de­scribes as a “hole-in-the-wall” at a two-storey shop­house in the Jalan Be­sar neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>“Brew­ing beer was also a learn­ing process, but we have gained ex­pe­ri­ence over time,” he said. “Now, it only takes us a month or two to de­velop one of our col­lec­tions as we have a much deeper un­der­stand­ing of all the in­gre­di­ents we use.”</p>
    <p>As their brews grew in pop­u­lar­ity over the years – both lo­cally and in Asia – the fam­ily ended up re­lo­cat­ing their brew­ery op­er­a­tions to a larger fa­cil­ity in Mandai Link in 2018.</p>
    <p>Their Mandai fa­cil­ity is now able to pro­duce up to 24,000 bot­tles of beer a month – in­clud­ing their best­sellers: lo­cal-themed Liang Teh Lager, Yel­low Van Pale Ale and Kaya Toast Stout. They also op­er­ate a tap room in Joo Chiat.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo Eng Kuang has quit his job as an au­di­tor. He now spends his time re­search­ing and de­vel­op­ing new beers as well as ex­plor­ing col­lab­o­ra­tions with other brands.</p>
    <p>“This busi­ness used to be a side hus­tle, but I have now poured all my en­ergy into it,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The tim­ing was right and I just thought – if not now, when?”</p>
