    <p>Scam cases in Sin­ga­pore are at an all-time high this year, with 10,402 re­ported as at Au­gust, nearly dou­ble the 5,229 for the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Scam­mers can ap­pear con­vinc­ing, but there are a few signs that can help you fig­ure out if a call, mes­sage or e-mail is gen­uine.</p>
    <p>Q Can I tell if a call is fake be­fore I pick up?</p>
    <p>A Yes. Be on your guard when the call is from an un­known num­ber or is pre­fixed with a plus (+) sign, as the call is likely com­ing from over­seas.</p>
    <p>Watch out in par­tic­u­lar for calls that come with a +65 pre­fix, which looks like Sin­ga­pore’s coun­try code, but are ac­tu­ally over­seas calls. Do­mes­tic calls will not dis­play the + pre­fix.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>Can I tell if a call is fake based on what the caller says?</p>
    <p>A Yes. Scam­mers will of­ten fake at­trac­tive deals such as low-in­ter­est loans and free gifts to lure you.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of what they are of­fer­ing, to get your money, scam­mers will need to ask you for your per­sonal or fi­nan­cial de­tails such as bank ac­count num­bers and pass­words at some point, or re­quest pay­ment for ser­vices ren­dered over the phone.</p>
    <p>Gen­uine call­ers from a gov­ern­ment agency or ser­vice provider will not ask for these de­tails or pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Q What about calls where I am told I have a prob­lem that needs fix­ing?</p>
    <p>A This is an in­creas­ingly com­mon tac­tic that scam­mers are em­ploy­ing to play on un­sus­pect­ing users’ anx­i­eties. For ex­am­ple, Singtel said the most com­mon type of scam call en­coun­tered by its cus­tomers pre­tended to be from tech sup­port.</p>
    <p>Watch out for call­ers who ask you to down­load a cer­tain soft­ware or app so they can “help” you fix the fake prob­lem. You could be hand­ing them the re­mote con­trol keys to your de­vice in­stead. If you sus­pect you are the tar­get of a scam call, hang up im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Q Can I tell if an e-mail is fake even if it ap­pears to be from a le­git­i­mate source?</p>
    <p>A Yes. Check the e-mail ad­dress of the sen­der care­fully for any strangely or in­cor­rectly spelt words, or if the ad­dress ends with an un­fa­mil­iar suf­fix.</p>
    <p>Scam e-mails will of­ten in­clude in­struc­tions to click on links or down­load at­tach­ments for more in­for­ma­tion. Do not do this. Con­sign such e-mails to the bin, or no­tify the or­gan­i­sa­tions be­ing spoofed of these scams.</p>
