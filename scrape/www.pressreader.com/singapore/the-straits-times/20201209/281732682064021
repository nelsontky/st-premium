    <p>Malaysia Bureau Chief In Kuala Lumpur</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s down­grade by one of the world’s top credit rat­ing agen­cies has cast a light on stan­dards of gov­er­nance and po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity in the coun­try where a third premier in as many years is fac­ing a po­ten­tial ouster.</p>
    <p>Fitch Rat­ings’ move to bring Malaysia’s sov­er­eign rat­ing down a step from A- to BBB+ was a re­ver­sal of sorts for what was once a bea­con of po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity in emerg­ing Asia un­til its first-ever change of gov­ern­ment in 2018.</p>
    <p>The agency’s commentary on its de­ci­sion last Fri­day sparked less con­cern at de­te­ri­o­rat­ing fis­cal met­rics – “re­duced eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity” due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has af­flicted “many coun­tries”, it said – com­pared with un­cer­tainty in pol­i­cy­mak­ing and “prospects for a fur­ther im­prove­ment in Malaysia’s gov­er­nance”.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment’s thin two-seat par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity im­plies per­sis­tent un­cer­tainty about fu­ture poli­cies,” Fitch said, not­ing that after an im­prove­ment last year, Malaysia’s World Bank gov­er­nance score has weak­ened this year to the 64th per­centile, which is closer to BBB-rated sov­er­eigns rather than those in A. “De­te­ri­o­ra­tion in gov­er­nance and con­tin­ued po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty could dampen in­vestor sen­ti­ment, con­strain­ing eco­nomic growth.”</p>
    <p>Not only has the fed­eral gov­ern­ment faced in­sta­bil­ity since the May 2018 elec­tion, but many of the coun­try’s 13 state ad­min­is­tra­tions have also been rocked, with chief min­is­ter­ships chang­ing hands on at least seven oc­ca­sions since then, in­clud­ing last week’s ouster of Perak’s Datuk Seri Faizal Azumu by his own Perikatan Na­sional (PN) al­lies.</p>
    <p>In an im­me­di­ate re­sponse, Fi­nance Min­is­ter Tengku Zafrul Aziz said “the gov­ern­ment is dis­ap­pointed with Fitch’s rat­ing out­come, par­tic­u­larly dur­ing these ex­cep­tional times as the Covid-19 pan­demic is still un­fold­ing” and ac­cused the firm of not giv­ing “due jus­tice and credit to our cri­sis re­sponse ef­forts”.</p>
    <p>This led to crit­i­cism that Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s ad­min­is­tra­tion – which con­trols only 112 seats in the 220-strong Par­lia­ment – has missed the point of the down­grade.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim said last Satur­day that the Fi­nance Min­is­ter “failed to ad­dress the key ar­eas of Fitch’s con­cerns, namely po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and gov­er­nance”.</p>
    <p>“The so-called ‘Sher­a­ton Move’ in Fe­bru­ary not only trig­gered po­lit­i­cal chaos, but also marked the be­gin­ning of a re­ver­sal of the in­sti­tu­tion re­forms that Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) had been cham­pi­oning,” he added, re­fer­ring to the coup that in­stalled PN.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s nine-month reign has been widely viewed as a pe­riod that has seen po­lit­i­cal im­per­a­tives take prece­dence in de­ci­sion-mak­ing, with more than nine-tenths of gov­ern­ment MPs be­ing ap­pointed to the ad­min­is­tra­tion or state-con­trolled com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The re­cent Peo­ple Power Un­der At­tack 2020 an­nual re­port by Civi­cus Mon­i­tor rated civil lib­er­ties in Malaysia as “ob­structed”, not­ing that “fol­low­ing the change of gov­ern­ment in early March 2020, ac­tivists in­clud­ing stu­dents have faced ju­di­cial ha­rass­ment from the po­lice for their ac­tivism” and jour­nal­ists have been ha­rassed by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>De­spite Datuk Seri Zafrul in­sist­ing the po­lit­i­cal cli­mate has not stopped “key leg­is­la­tion... in re­la­tion with the fi­nanc­ing of Covid-19 mea­sures, as well as... Bud­get 2021” from be­ing passed, the lat­ter Bill only se­cured a sec­ond read­ing last month after the gov­ern­ment suc­cumbed to pres­sure from its own back­benchers to ex­tend loan mora­to­ri­ums and broaden im­me­di­ate with­drawals from statu­tory re­tire­ment sav­ings.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion and an­a­lysts have called on the gov­ern­ment to ta­ble a con­fi­dence mo­tion in Par­lia­ment to prove its ma­jor­ity and ease con­cerns over its sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“In nor­mal cir­cum­stances, a down­grade is not a jus­ti­fi­able rea­son to call for a vote of no con­fi­dence... but the con­text is... the par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity be­long­ing to PN is very slim. It is not un­rea­son­able for the op­po­si­tion to raise this,” said Ms Tri­cia Yeoh, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the think-tank Ideas.</p>
    <p>AmBank Re­search said on Mon­day that “the down­grade serves to high­light the need to fur­ther strengthen our re­forms, trans­parency and in­clu­sive­ness”.</p>
    <p>“The down­grade would raise our bor­row­ing cost. How­ever, it now re­mains un­clear if S&P and Moody’s will fol­low suit,” it added, re­fer­ring to the rest of the “Big Three” rat­ing firms.</p>
    <p>S&P had changed, in June, its out­look on Malaysia from sta­ble to neg­a­tive as “un­cer­tainty re­gard­ing... fur­ther changes in gov­ern­ment, or snap polls” un­der­mine “the pre­dictabil­ity of pol­i­cy­mak­ing at a cru­cial junc­ture”.</p>
    <p>With the gov­ern­ment pro­ject­ing 2020 and 2021 deficits to be worth 6 per cent and 5.4 per cent of the econ­omy re­spec­tively, it will need to bor­row more than RM170 bil­lion (S$56 bil­lion) in these two years to fund Covid-19 stim­u­lus pack­ages and devel­op­ment spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial ex­perts be­lieve in­creas­ing ac­count­abil­ity in gov­ern­ment and hav­ing a pic­ture of how to pay off cur­rent spend­ing – Bud­get 2021 is Malaysia’s largest ever at RM322 bil­lion – would im­prove the tra­jec­tory of the coun­try’s credit rat­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Jalil Rasheed, for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of Per­modalan Na­sional Ber­had, one of the largest state fund man­agers, called on pol­i­cy­mak­ers to “start delink­ing busi­ness and pol­i­tics and let it be run pro­fes­sion­ally. This will en­sure a con­tin­u­a­tion should there be fu­ture po­lit­i­cal change”.</p>
    <p>Deputy Fi­nance Min­is­ter Sha­har Ab­dul­lah told Par­lia­ment on Mon­day that pub­lic cof­fers were be­ing hit by lower oil prices of about US$40 per bar­rel in­stead of US$60 pro­jected for this year and that bring­ing back the un­pop­u­lar goods and ser­vices tax on con­sump­tion – canned by the PH gov­ern­ment in 2018 – was “not our cur­rent pri­or­ity”.</p>
    <p>“We are im­ple­ment­ing struc­tural re­forms to broaden rev­enue and im­prove gov­er­nance. The Fi­nance Min­is­ter is com­mit­ted to a Fis­cal Re­spon­si­bil­ity Act,” he said.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial ex­perts be­lieve in­creas­ing ac­count­abil­ity in gov­ern­ment and hav­ing a pic­ture of how to pay off cur­rent spend­ing – Bud­get 2021 is Malaysia’s largest ever at RM322 bil­lion (S$106 bil­lion) – would im­prove the tra­jec­tory of the coun­try’s credit rat­ing.</p>
