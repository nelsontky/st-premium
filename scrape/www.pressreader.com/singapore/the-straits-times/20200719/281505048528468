    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s vi­sion of a mul­tira­cial so­ci­ety is en­shrined in its na­tional pledge: “One united peo­ple re­gard­less of race, lan­guage, or reli­gion.”</p>
    <p>Even though the Repub­lic has made sig­nif­i­cant progress in re­al­is­ing this vi­sion, the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion put the spot­light on long-held as­sump­tions about race and lan­guage in pol­i­tics and cam­paign­ing. Younger vot­ers also sig­nalled greater open­ness to­wards dis­cussing race is­sues, in a way that gen­er­a­tions be­fore them would have con­sid­ered taboo or po­lar­is­ing.</p>
    <p>In a coun­try that has four of­fi­cial lan­guages, eye­brows were raised when the Work­ers’ Party (WP) did not send a rep­re­sen­ta­tive to a tele­vised live de­bate in Man­darin – given that for­mer party chief Low Thia Khi­ang was known for his fiery Teochew speeches that had at­tracted its tra­di­tional Chi­nese base in the first place.</p>
    <p>The WP, Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party, Na­tional Sol­i­dar­ity Party and Re­form Party also did not send Tamil-speak­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tives to the party po­lit­i­cal broad­casts, in part due to the gen­eral lack of new Tamil can­di­dates and speak­ers flu­ent in that lan­guage.</p>
    <p>WP can­di­date and now Sengkang GRC MP Raeesah Khan came un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion af­ter two po­lice re­ports were made against her for Face­book posts in which she sug­gested that the au­thor­i­ties dis­crim­i­nated against mi­nori­ties. Her case drew the ire of younger vot­ers who felt she was un­fairly tar­geted.</p>
    <p>The WP, led by Mr Pri­tam Singh, picked up a sec­ond GRC in Sengkang, while a mi­nor­ity-heavy WP slate in Alju­nied did not pre­vent it from scor­ing a hat-trick, af­ter hav­ing wrested the con­stituency from the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) in 2011.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in Jurong GRC, Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam’s team won a thump­ing 75 per cent of the vote – the high­est GRC vote share for the PAP this year – lead­ing some to ask why the pop­u­lar politi­cian had not been con­sid­ered as a po­ten­tial prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of race in this GE even led to a po­lice re­port be­ing filed against Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat for re­marks he made last year, that Sin­ga­pore was not yet ready for a non-Chi­nese prime min­is­ter. The po­lice later said it had con­sulted the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, which ad­vised that no of­fence had been made.</p>
    <p>THE GEN­ER­A­TION GAP</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has seen race ri­ots in the past – from the Maria Her­togh ri­ots in 1950, to clashes be­tween Chi­nese and Malays in the 1960s.</p>
    <p>For decades, the of­fi­cial nar­ra­tive has been: Race re­la­tions are highly sen­si­tive and must be care­fully dis­cussed in pub­lic. Pre­serv­ing racial har­mony is es­sen­tial to Sin­ga­pore’s sta­bil­ity, which in turn en­sures in­vestor con­fi­dence and cre­ates jobs.</p>
    <p>“Whether (the in­sta­bil­ity) came from com­mu­nal­ism, from the left or any sort of in­sta­bil­ity, we cut down on that in or­der to achieve cer­tain goals for so­ci­ety,” ex­plained Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam at a di­a­logue on race last year.</p>
    <p>While many Sin­ga­pore­ans still tip­toe around dis­cussing race pub­licly, sur­veys have shown that young Sin­ga­pore­ans are more will­ing to have dif­fi­cult con­ver­sa­tions on this is­sue.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing this, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said in an on­line rally on July 8 that while the coun­try has em­pha­sised racial tol­er­ance and har­mony so far, it can do bet­ter and go be­yond that.</p>
    <p>“But we should do it care­fully, and we should dis­cuss be­tween the young ones and the older ones so that we grad­u­ally get a meet­ing of minds,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say gen­er­a­tional dif­fer­ences may have to do more with ap­proach than sub­stance.</p>
    <p>“All un­der­stand the im­por­tance of healthy in­ter-racial and in­ter-re­li­gious ties in Sin­ga­pore. Where they dif­fer is on how to achieve such out­comes,” says Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity law don Eu­gene Tan.</p>
    <p>He says the older gen­er­a­tion, hav­ing ex­pe­ri­enced the race ri­ots in the 1960s, re­gard race and reli­gion as highly sen­si­tive top­ics un­suit­able for “mass con­sump­tion”.</p>
    <p>“On the other hand, younger Sin­ga­pore­ans who live in rel­a­tive calm and sta­bil­ity feel such is­sues should be more openly dis­cussed, be­cause that is how bet­ter un­der­stand­ing can come about.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser says the di­vide also has to do with ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>He thinks that be­cause the younger gen­er­a­tion are more likely to have at­tained at least post-sec­ondary or ter­tiary ed­u­ca­tion, they would have en­coun­tered broader per­spec­tives on race is­sues.</p>
    <p>“They would be more open to recog­nise the pres­ence of racial prej­u­dice, dis­crim­i­na­tion and in­equal­ity in Sin­ga­pore,” he says.</p>
    <p>A QUES­TION OF LAN­GUAGE</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal par­ties paid vary­ing de­grees of at­ten­tion to lan­guage rep­re­sen­ta­tion dur­ing the hus­tings.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the PAP’s ap­proach, Mr Shan­mugam had said it takes all four of­fi­cial lan­guages “very se­ri­ously”. While not all par­ties fielded Tamil speak­ers, the PAP did so to show the Tamil pop­u­la­tion that they are re­spected and val­ued, he added.</p>
    <p>But an­a­lysts do not think lan­guage was a deal-breaker.</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies se­nior research fel­low Mathew Mathews says that while some do want of­fi­cial speeches to be made in a lan­guage they are fa­mil­iar with, they may over­look this if they have other con­cerns, such as hav­ing more op­po­si­tion voices in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Also, he says, more is ex­pected of the in­cum­bent than the op­po­si­tion. “The sta­tus of the four of­fi­cial lan­guages is some­thing that the Gov­ern­ment has tried to en­sure since in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>“If the PAP in its cam­paign did not show its sup­port by en­sur­ing that it had speak­ers of all lan­guages, there might have been much more un­hap­pi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Dr Nazry Bahrawi, a se­nior lec­turer at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign, says Chi­nese Sin­ga­pore­ans seem to be more for­giv­ing of the can­di­dates’ less pow­er­ful com­mand of Man­darin, per­haps be­cause many them­selves strug­gle with it.</p>
    <p>“So when Mr Pri­tam Singh apol­o­gised to vot­ers for not field­ing a can­di­date for the Chi­nese de­bate be­cause ‘the qual­ity of the pro­fi­ciency re­quired to par­tic­i­pate in a live de­bate is of a higher or­der’, this prob­a­bly res­onated with vot­ers”.</p>
    <p>But ex­pec­ta­tions were dif­fer­ent for the Malay can­di­dates, he says, not­ing that WP can­di­date Fadli Fawzi was widely praised by the Malay com­mu­nity when he read a pan­tun (Malay poem) on Nom­i­na­tion Day, while lin­guis­tic faux pas from PAP can­di­dates like Wan Rizal Wan Zakariah were turned into memes on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>TO­WARDS RACE-BLIND POL­I­TICS?</p>
    <p>For some, the strong show­ing by eth­nic mi­nor­ity can­di­dates in the elec­tion is proof that Sin­ga­pore­ans look be­yond race when cast­ing their vote.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to the mi­nor­ity-dom­i­nant Alju­nied team, IPS’ Dr Mathews says that with its mem­bers hav­ing served in Par­lia­ment for a while, vot­ers may iden­tify more with the op­po­si­tion plat­form that they run on than their race, hav­ing seen them de­bate poli­cies in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“Vot­ers seem to ap­pre­ci­ate a diver­sity of po­lit­i­cal opin­ions rather than a diver­sity of eth­nic­ity, which could be su­per­fi­cial. This sug­gests a level of ma­tu­rity on the part of Sin­ga­porean vot­ers,” says Dr Nazry.</p>
    <p>Dr Walid Jum­blatt Ab­dul­lah, as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s</p>
    <p>School of So­cial Sciences, says Mr Singh and Mr Thar­man cham­pion is­sues at the na­tional level and rarely ever talk about “In­dian is­sues”.</p>
    <p>“That is per­haps why they are viewed favourably across the board.</p>
    <p>“This does not mean that race com­pletely does not mat­ter in vot­ing – but it does call into ques­tion how much,” he says.</p>
    <p>What about the in­ci­dent in­volv­ing 26-year-old Ms Raeesah?</p>
    <p>Dr Nazry thinks the is­sue was not race per se, but the PAP’s re­sponse.</p>
    <p>“We need to con­sider that she was WP’s youngest fielded can­di­date.</p>
    <p>“The po­lice re­ports that were filed against her an­gered some vot­ers not be­cause of her cri­tique of Sin­ga­pore’s race re­la­tions, but be­cause they were in­censed by what they con­sid­ered gut­ter pol­i­tics,” he says.</p>
    <p>He adds that some vot­ers may have swung to the WP in Sengkang be­cause they per­ceived that she was be­ing “bul­lied”.</p>
    <p>RE-IMAG­IN­ING RACE CON­VER­SA­TIONS</p>
    <p>Dr Walid says one must not au­to­mat­i­cally as­sume that con­ver­sa­tions on race are di­vi­sive.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment would do well to un­der­stand that peo­ple do want to en­gage in such con­ver­sa­tions,” he says.</p>
    <p>“When peo­ple cross the line a lit­tle, the first in­stinct should be not a tough sanc­tion, but rather, to ad­vise and gen­er­ate more con­ver­sa­tion as to why a par­tic­u­lar ac­tion or speech is wrong.”</p>
    <p>Dr Nazry notes that younger Sin­ga­pore­ans, in par­tic­u­lar, did not like how the Gov­ern­ment came down hard on those who asked dif­fi­cult ques­tions – rightly or wrongly – about whether cer­tain races or groups of peo­ple are treated dif­fer­ently un­der the law.</p>
    <p>He re­ferred to lo­cal YouTu­ber Preeti Nair, known as Preeti­pls, and her brother Sub­has, who last year were given a con­di­tional warn­ing by the po­lice over their con­tro­ver­sial on­line rap video, made in re­sponse to a “brown­face” ad­ver­tise­ment fea­tur­ing Me­di­a­corp ac­tor and DJ Den­nis Chew.</p>
    <p>As for Ms Raeesah, the older of her two Face­book posts was writ­ten two years ago, lead­ing some to ques­tion the close tim­ing of the po­lice re­port to Polling Day.</p>
    <p>“The case of Raeesah Khan is in­struc­tive here, but so too were the ex­am­ples of Preeti­pls and Sub­has. Go­ing hard on these peo­ple sends the mes­sage that the ‘vic­timised’ are to be pun­ished fur­ther,” Dr Nazry says.</p>
    <p>Schools are a good start­ing point to evolve the con­ver­sa­tion on race, says SMU’s Pro­fes­sor Tan, but teach­ers must be ad­e­quately trained to han­dle such con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the de­bate on the min­istries’ bud­gets in March this year, it was an­nounced that sec­ondary schools would en­gage stu­dents on con­tem­po­rary is­sues – in­clud­ing race and reli­gion – fort­nightly.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said on Thurs­day that the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion is train­ing more teach­ers who can spe­cialise in this and can fa­cil­i­tate such dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan also asks whether the GRC sys­tem ought to be re­viewed. Set up in 1988, GRCs seek to en­sure that the mi­nor­ity races in</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will al­ways be rep­re­sented in Par­lia­ment. At least one of the MPs in the group rep­re­sent­ing a GRC must be­long to a mi­nor­ity racial com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“But the no­tion of a hy­phen­ated-Sin­ga­porean is in­creas­ingly seen as out­moded, espe­cially for younger vot­ers,” he ex­plains, re­fer­ring to the coun­try’s long­stand­ing Chi­nese-Malay-In­dian-Oth­ers frame­work, which of­fi­cially clas­si­fies peo­ple ac­cord­ing to their eth­nic­ity.</p>
    <p>As PM Lee had said in his on­line rally, it would not be re­al­is­tic to treat one an­other in a com­pletely colour-blind way – what some Western aca­demics term a “post-racial” so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Sin­ga­pore­ans are still re­minded of their racial iden­tity in their daily in­ter­ac­tions, from the im­print on their iden­tity cards to job ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>It is in this con­text that Sin­ga­pore could as­pire to­wards a “post-racialised” – rather than post-racial – so­ci­ety, says Dr Nazry.</p>
    <p>“It means that we should not make race our pri­mary iden­tity marker that dic­tates the way poli­cies and laws are made. It also means we must tackle racial dis­crim­i­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Says Prof Tan: “We may never at­tain a post-racial so­ci­ety, but that should not stop Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans from com­ing as close as pos­si­ble to nur­tur­ing a state of af­fairs where con­ver­sa­tions on race and reli­gion are no longer taboo and seen as di­vi­sive.”</p>
    <p>For some, the strong show­ing by eth­nic mi­nor­ity can­di­dates in the elec­tion is proof that Sin­ga­pore­ans look be­yond race when cast­ing their vote.</p>
