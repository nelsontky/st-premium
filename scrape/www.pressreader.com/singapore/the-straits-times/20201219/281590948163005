    <p>When the of­fi­cial school year starts on Jan 4 for Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) kinder­gartens and pri­mary schools, only Kinder­garten 1 chil­dren and Pri­mary 1 pupils need to re­port to their new schools.</p>
    <p>Kinder­garten 2 and Pri­mary 2 to Pri­mary 6 chil­dren will re­main at home and re­port to school only on Jan 5. It will be an ex­tra day of school holidays for them.</p>
    <p>MOE said yes­ter­day that special ed­u­ca­tion and se­condary schools will also re­open on Jan 4, while ju­nior col­leges and the Mil­len­nia In­sti­tute (MI) will start on Jan 11.</p>
    <p>On the ear­lier start date for K1 and P1 chil­dren, MOE said this is to bet­ter wel­come the younger chil­dren, and en­sure that safe man­age­ment mea­sures can be im­ple­mented ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>“If needed, at most one par­ent/ guardian will be al­lowed to ac­com­pany their K1 or P1 child/ward to their new school to fa­mil­iarise (them) with the new en­vi­ron­ment, while still keep­ing all stu­dents safe,” it said.</p>
    <p>House­wife Joanna Tan, 40, who has a son and a daugh­ter start­ing P6 and P2 re­spec­tively next year,</p>
    <p>said her chil­dren were over­joyed that they have an ex­tra day’s break.</p>
    <p>“We’ll be spend­ing the day re­lax­ing and mak­ing sure all their books are packed and ev­ery­thing is ready,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mrs Tan added: “It’s a good move, es­pe­cially for the P1s. It will be eas­ier for the school with fewer stu­dents to man­age on the first day. There are also a lot of new rou­tines for the P1s and their par­ents to learn and get used to.”</p>
    <p>Schools will re­open fully with most co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties and school ac­tiv­i­ties al­lowed, and higher-risk ac­tiv­i­ties sus­pended or lim­ited to a smaller group size.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents need not have their TraceTo­gether to­kens when schools re­open, but the to­kens will be re­quired in schools af­ter na­tion­wide distri­bu­tion is com­pleted.</p>
    <p>The min­istry added that kinder­garten care will not be open for K2 chil­dren on Jan 4, to al­low the MOE kinder­gartens to ac­com­mo­date the par­ents of K1 chil­dren on that day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, school-based stu­dent care cen­tres will be open on Jan 4 for P2 to P6 pupils en­rolled in such cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Se­condary schools, ju­nior col­leges and MI will re­sume their school year as sched­uled, and par­ents or guardians will be al­lowed</p>
    <p>only to drop off their child or ward at school.</p>
    <p>MOE said that safe man­age­ment mea­sures will con­tinue to be ob­served to en­sure that schools re­main a safe place for teach­ing and learn­ing. Th­ese in­clude the vis­ual screen­ing and tem­per­a­ture-tak­ing of in­di­vid­u­als and safe dis­tanc­ing be­tween stu­dents and staff.</p>
    <p>The min­istry re­minded stu­dents who are un­well, with flu-like symp­toms such as fever or cough, to seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion and stay away from school.</p>
    <p>From mid-Fe­bru­ary to late Fe­bru­ary next year, the Na­tional School Games will re­sume for sports</p>
    <p>across A, B and Se­nior divi­sions which meet the na­tional guide­lines. Th­ese in­clude bad­minton, gym­nas­tics and sail­ing.</p>
    <p>Sports such as foot­ball, hockey and net­ball are still not al­lowed. MOE said it is work­ing on how th­ese sports can re­sume “in a safe and mean­ing­ful way”.</p>
    <p>From late March to early May, the Sin­ga­pore Youth Fes­ti­val Arts Pre­sen­ta­tion for se­condary schools, JCs and MI will also re­sume for events which meet the na­tional guide­lines. Th­ese in­clude band, dance and drama.</p>
