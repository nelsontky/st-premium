    <p>The trio al­legedly linked to the mur­der of four-year-old Megan Khung Yu Wai will be fur­ther re­manded for one more week at the Cen­tral Po­lice Di­vi­sion af­ter a district judge al­lowed the pros­e­cu­tion’s ap­pli­ca­tion for the move yes­ter­day .</p>
    <p>The girl’s mother, Foo Li Ping, 24, and a man iden­ti­fied as Wong Shi Xiang, 33, are ac­cused of killing her in an apart­ment at the Suites @ Guille­mard con­do­minium in Lim Ah Woo Road in Fe­bru­ary this year.</p>
    <p>They al­legedly worked with a sec­ond woman, Nou­velle Chua Ru­oshi, 30, to get rid of Megan’s body by burn­ing it in a metal bar­rel at Paya Ubi In­dus­trial Park in Ubi Av­enue 1 in May.</p>
    <p>Chua’s lawyer, Mr Thangavelu from Tri­dent Law Cor­po­ra­tion, had ear­lier op­posed Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Mar­cus Foo’s ap­pli­ca­tion for his client’s fur­ther re­mand. Mr Thangavelu also pro­posed for his client to be dealt with sep­a­rately from the other two sus­pects as she does not face a mur­der charge.</p>
    <p>He told District Judge Ter­ence Tay that Chua’s case could, in fact, be heard at the State Courts, not the Supreme Court where mur­der tri­als are held.</p>
    <p>The judge, how­ever, granted the DPP’s ap­pli­ca­tion, not­ing the pros­e­cu­tion still needs time to gather ev­i­dence on the case.</p>
    <p>The court also heard yes­ter­day that Foo will be rep­re­sented by lawyer Jose­phus Tan and his team from In­vic­tus Law Cor­po­ra­tion. The team and Mr Peter Keith Fer­nando from Leo Fer­nando law firm had turned up in court last week, in­di­cat­ing they had been ap­proached by Foo’s fam­ily to rep­re­sent her. Mr Tan had ear­lier said Foo’s mother had con­tacted his firm. Mr Fer­nando, on the other hand, was ap­proached by Foo’s cousin.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Tan told the court he has ap­plied on Mr Fer­nando’s be­half for the lat­ter to be dis­charged from the case.</p>
    <p>Wong is rep­re­sented by Mr Vinit Ch­habra from Vinit Ch­habra Law Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Wong had ear­lier ap­peared in court to face charges un­re­lated to the mur­der case. He is ac­cused of six drug-re­lated of­fences, in­clud­ing metham­phetamine traf­fick­ing and con­sump­tion in 2018. On Nov 22 that year, Wong is said to have been in pos­ses­sion of two sa­mu­rai swords in a Gey­lang East Av­enue 1 flat. He is also ac­cused of as­sault­ing a man in the same unit two days later.</p>
    <p>The trio’s cases have been ad­journed to Aug 13.</p>
