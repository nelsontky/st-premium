    <p>HSINCHU (Tai­wan) • A fes­ti­val i n Tai­wan where enor­mous pigs are slaugh­tered and dis­played is draw­ing smaller crowds as an­i­mal rights ac­tivists al­ter perception­s of the con­tro­ver­sial tra­di­tion.</p>
    <p>The an­nual rit­ual is a cul­tural cor­ner­stone for the is­land’s Hakka com­mu­nity, who make up about 15 per cent of Tai­wan’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>But it has long been a po­lar­is­ing cus­tom.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal Hakka fam­i­lies com­pete to dis­play the largest pig, with the win­ner tak­ing home a tro­phy.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day last week, 18 slaugh­tered pigs were wheeled out on trucks, with fan­fare of tra­di­tional mu­sic played on gongs and horns, into the Hs­inpu Yimin Tem­ple in the is­land’s north.</p>
    <p>The heav­i­est weighed a whop­ping 860kg – three times the av­er­age adult swine.</p>
    <p>The car­casses, bris­tles shaved and pinned with dec­o­ra­tions, were dis­played up­side down with pineap­ples stuffed in their mouths, dwarfed by their bloated tor­sos.</p>
    <p>After the fes­ti­val, the car­casses are typ­i­cally taken home by their own­ers and the meat dis­trib­uted to friends, fam­ily and neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Mr Tseng Jia-yun’s fam­ily spent three years fat­ten­ing up their pig, which was slaugh­tered last week at a weight of 400kg. The sac­ri­fice ful­filled the wishes of his 86-year-old grand­mother.</p>
    <p>“As a Hakka, I am proud of this di­vine pig cul­ture. It’s worth pre­serv­ing,” he said, de­scrib­ing the con­cerns of an­i­mal rights groups as “non­sense”.</p>
    <p>“There’s no cru­elty to an­i­mals, con­trary to the ru­mours be­ing spread around,” he added.</p>
    <p>SOME SAY RIT­UAL IS OUT­DATED</p>
    <p>An­i­mal rights cam­paign­ers dis­agree. They say the heav­i­est pigs are force-fed and of­ten kept in small cages, to the point where the mor­bidly obese an­i­mals are un­able to get up.</p>
    <p>“The pigs are so heavy that they can’t even stand,” said Ms Lin Tai-ching, di­rec­tor of the En­vi­ron­ment and An­i­mal So­ci­ety of Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Ms Lin has been doc­u­ment­ing the “holy pig” fes­ti­val for the last 15 years and says at­ti­tudes are be­gin­ning to change. Crowds have be­gun to thin and the num­ber of sac­ri­fices has fallen dra­mat­i­cally.</p>
    <p>“Fif­teen years ago, there were more than 100 swine in the con­test, com­pared to 37 this year,” she said.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of an­i­mals over 600kg had also plum­meted, she added.</p>
    <p>Two sub­mis­sions this year were made up of rice pack­ets dis­played in the shape of a pig, a sign that some par­tic­i­pat­ing fam­i­lies are re­ject­ing an­i­mal sac­ri­fices.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers and lo­cals say that while the fes­ti­val dates back cen­turies, the tra­di­tion of sac­ri­fic­ing fat­tened pigs is a more re­cent phe­nom­e­non.</p>
    <p>The Hakka are one of the many eth­nic groups from main­land China who set­tled in Tai­wan over the last few hun­dred years.</p>
    <p>Each sum­mer, the Hs­inpu Yimin Tem­ple com­mem­o­rates a group of Hakka who died de­fend­ing their vil­lages dur­ing a pe­riod of po­lit­i­cal up­heaval in the late 18th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it was dur­ing Ja­pan’s colo­nial oc­cu­pa­tion of Tai­wan in the early 20th cen­tury that the sac­ri­fice of fat­tened pigs be­came a com­mon part of cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>The cus­tom was tur­bocharged in the 1980s and 1990s, with the pigs get­ting big­ger and big­ger.</p>
    <p>“The Yimin fes­ti­val is to hon­our our an­ces­tors who died de­fend­ing our home­land, a dis­play of loy­alty and brother­hood,” said Mr Tseng.</p>
    <p>Ms Lin and other an­i­mal rights ac­tivists say they have no de­sire to end Hakka cul­tural cus­toms. In­stead, they want to see the fes­ti­val’s more cruel el­e­ments tamed.</p>
    <p>“We are not against the sac­ri­fice of pigs,” she said, “but we are against com­pe­ti­tions based on an an­i­mal’s weight.”</p>
