    <p>MEM­PHIS (Ten­nessee) • An Byeong-hun can see clearly now, after mov­ing into con­tention at the WGC-St Jude In­vi­ta­tional on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Chas­ing his first PGA Tour vic­tory, the South Korean en­joyed a good day on the greens with six birdies for a sec­ond-round score of five-un­der 65 at TPC South­wind on Fri­day. That pro­pelled him to a share of third place along­side de­fend­ing cham­pion, Amer­i­can Brooks Koepka (71).</p>
    <p>Bren­don Todd, who carded a bo­gey-free 65 for a total of 11-un­der 129, has a four-shot lead over the pair. He is two strokes in front of fel­low Amer­i­can Rickie Fowler (67), but An be­lieves he can fi­nally break his Tour duck to­day.</p>
    <p>He started work­ing with putting coach Brad Faxon, an eight-time Tour win­ner, re­cently.</p>
    <p>The work has been re­warded thus far with a haul of 12 birdies, putting him tied for the lead with the most birdies at the US$10.5 mil­lion (S$14.4 mil­lion) show­piece.</p>
    <p>“Brad was a great op­tion and he was nice enough to see me for a cou­ple weeks,” the world No. 62 said.</p>
    <p>“Then, as the re­sults show, I think it’s been work­ing the last cou­ple of weeks, even though I didn’t have the best re­sults at Me­mo­rial and the week before.</p>
    <p>“My putting stats are a lot bet­ter than (at) the be­gin­ning of the year. I like how things are going right now. It’s mak­ing big progress and, like I said ear­lier, I just need to hit it bet­ter to give my­self more birdie chances.”</p>
    <p>Renowned as one of the game’s best ball-strik­ers, An, who has five top-10s fin­ishes this season, has of­ten been let down by his con­ver­sion rate with the flat stick. He ranks a lowly 203rd in strokes gained putting this year.</p>
    <p>But, this week, he has ranked 10th in putting, which has given him a sniff at be­com­ing the first Korean win­ner of a WGC event.</p>
    <p>Cred­it­ing Faxon for not just work­ing on his putting tech­nique, the 28-year-old said: “There are a few things we’re work­ing on, more of a vis­ual, green read­ings and try­ing to get bet­ter at those.</p>
    <p>“To be fair, not much tech­nique. Lit­tle things here and there, (and) changed my rou­tine a lit­tle bit.</p>
    <p>“It’s so sim­ple that I changed it within like four, five days. It wasn’t that I had to work hard to change it.</p>
    <p>“It’s quite a big change, but not a big change, if you know what I mean. Very sim­ple things and it seems to be work­ing, that’s for sure.”</p>
    <p>An has such a good sense of hu­mour that when an English golf fan-cum-song­writer, Sam Har­rop, pro­duced a song par­ody on Twit­ter about his game, the 2015 BMW PGA Cham­pi­onship win­ner re­sponded by stamp­ing the lyrics on his wedges last month.</p>
    <p>“Yeah, that can go away now, I guess,” he said. “I think I have my nor­mal eyes back, read­ing the putts a lot bet­ter. He wrote a song about me, so that was nice of him.</p>
    <p>“I know where I stand with my putting stats, which is not near the av­er­age.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, things change the next cou­ple weeks, and my putting this week has been great.</p>
    <p>“We’ll see at the end of the week how I putt. So far, so good.”</p>
