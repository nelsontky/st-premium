    <p>• Lance Stroll was at a loss for words after he up­staged For­mula One’s ti­tle-chas­ing Lewis Hamil­ton yes­ter­day when he grabbed his first ca­reer pole po­si­tion at the Turk­ish Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old Cana­dian made the most of dry­ing con­di­tions on a treach­er­ous track to end Mercedes’ 13-race dom­i­na­tion of qual­i­fy­ing this year.</p>
    <p>He de­liv­ered a daz­zling fastest lap for Rac­ing Point i n 1min 47.765sec in the clos­ing sec­onds to usurp his team­mate Ser­gio Perez and then re­sist a last surge from Red Bull’s Max Ver­stap­pen.</p>
    <p>The Dutch­man was sec­ond, three-tenths be­hind Stroll, but ahead of Mex­i­can Perez, who claimed his ca­reer-best start­ing po­si­tion after fin­ish­ing fourth nine times be­fore.</p>
    <p>“I can’t re­ally put it into words. I’m shocked. I didn’t ex­pect to be up here after FP3,” said Stroll after a qual­i­fy­ing ses­sion in­ter­rupted by two red flags.</p>
    <p>He said he owed his suc­cess to feel­ing at home on the ice rink-like slip­pery and treach­er­ous con­di­tions, as heavy rain in­ter­rupted pro­ceed­ings and ren­dered the track un­safe for 45 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“I love it and I have al­ways en­joyed it,” he said. “At home, I grew up driv­ing on ice in our park­ing lot with lots of drift­ing and slid­ing around with­out much grip. It’s in my bones, I guess.</p>
    <p>“In these con­di­tions, you don’t re­ally have time to think about what’s go­ing on around you. It’s re­ally just about the next cor­ner.”</p>
    <p>He is the first Cana­dian to take pole since Jac­ques Vil­leneuve at the 1997 Euro­pean Grand Prix at Jerez. It is the Sil­ver­stone-based Rac­ing Point team’s first pole since, rac­ing as Jor­dan, they did so at the 2009 Bel­gian Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Stroll’s sur­prise qual­i­fy­ing per­for­mance comes after a tough few weeks when he had to miss the Eifel Grand Prix, test­ing pos­i­tive for coro­n­avirus the next day.</p>
    <p>The out­come left Mercedes well-beaten on the week­end when Hamil­ton bids to seal a record­e­qualling sev­enth driv­ers’ cham­pi­onship and draw level with Michael Schu­macher.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton wound up sixth be­hind Alex Al­bon in the sec­ond Red Bull and Re­nault’s Daniel Ric­cia­rdo, whose team­mate Este­ban</p>
    <p>Mercedes’ con­sec­u­tive run of poles this year, be­fore Rac­ing Point’s Lance Stroll broke the streak yes­ter­day with his ca­reer first start from P1.</p>
    <p>Ocon qual­i­fied sev­enth. Kimi Raikko­nen and his Alfa Romeo team­mate An­to­nio Giov­inazzi were eighth and 10th, with Valt­teri Bot­tas ninth for Mercedes.</p>
    <p>“We did the best we could and that was as fast as we could go,” Hamil­ton said. “The track feels ter­ri­ble, it’s just like driv­ing on ice but for what­ever rea­son, some peo­ple can get the tyres switched on bet­ter than us.”</p>
    <p>This is the first time this year nei­ther Hamil­ton (nine) nor Bot­tas (four) have topped qual­i­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>Ver­stap­pen ex­pressed his dis­ap­point­ment, adding: “In Q1 we tried to go out on the in­ters (in­ter­me­di­ates). It was faster in Q3, but for us the in­ters were hor­ri­ble. The ex­treme tyres were good for us.</p>
    <p>“At the mo­ment I’m just a bit dis­ap­pointed, I just hope we have a good race to­mor­row.”</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton can seal his sev­enth driv­ers’ world ti­tle to­day if he pre­vents Bot­tas from outscor­ing him by eight points.</p>
