    <p>LON­DON • Bren­dan Rodgers saluted “world-class” Jamie Vardy af­ter he sealed Le­ices­ter’s late 1-0 win as splut­ter­ing Ar­se­nal crashed to a third de­feat in their last four Premier League games on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son’s Golden Boot win­ner was fit enough for only the bench af­ter a re­cent calf in­jury. But the Foxes man­ager brought on the striker with 30 min­utes left af­ter sens­ing the hosts, de­void of at­tack­ing ideas, were there for the tak­ing.</p>
    <p>Vardy re­sponded with his sixth top-flight goal of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Youri Tiele­mans’ ball over the top for Cen­giz Un­der was per­fectly weighted and the Turkey winger, who also came off the bench, squared across goal for Vardy to head into the empty net.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old has made a habit of tor­ment­ing Ar­se­nal and has now scored 11 goals in 12 Premier League games against them.</p>
    <p>“Our plan was al­ways to bring Jamie Vardy into the game and he can stretch it. He makes the big con­tri­bu­tions in the big games. It’s al­ways the case, ev­ery game he looks like scor­ing,” Rodgers said af­ter Le­ices­ter’s first win at Ar­se­nal since 1973.</p>
    <p>“That shows you the level he is at and he is a world-class player. I’m lucky to have him.”</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter climbed to fourth af­ter end­ing a run of two suc­ces­sive league de­feats, leav­ing Rodgers de­lighted at how com­fort­able his in­jury-hit side looked at the Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>“We de­served it, we played against a re­ally good side and have play­ers who can run in be­hind,” he said. “To keep a clean sheet and play with the qual­ity and calm­ness was good.”</p>
    <p>Ar­se­nal are lan­guish­ing in 10th af­ter a sec­ond con­sec­u­tive league loss fol­low­ing their 1-0 de­feat at Manch­ester City last week­end.</p>
    <p>But it might have been a dif­fer­ent story when Alexan­dre La­cazette headed in from a cor­ner early on, only for his open­ing ef­fort to be dis­al­lowed for off­side against Granit Xhaka – a de­ci­sion that left man­ager Mikel Arteta fum­ing.</p>
    <p>“I’m re­ally dis­ap­pointed, we had it in our hands in the first half and I don’t know how the hell the goal was dis­al­lowed,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is dif­fi­cult to cre­ate spa­ces with 10 men be­hind the ball, but we should have fin­ished the game bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“They de­fended deeper in the sec­ond half, wait­ing for the mis­take and in one mo­ment, they did it. Against this block, against so wellor­gan­ised teams, when you open them up, you have to put the ball in the back of the net.”</p>
    <p>Aside from their usual prob­lems in de­fence, with Arteta’s back­line – in par­tic­u­lar sub­sti­tute Shko­dran Mustafi – caught square as Vardy pounced, Ar­se­nal are also strug­gling for in­spi­ra­tion up front.</p>
    <p>Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang has suf­fered a sharp dip in form – the Gabon for­ward is with­out a goal in his last five league games, his worst drought since 2014 – and the cap­tain has scored just once in the league this sea­son, de­spite sign­ing a lu­cra­tive new con­tract last month.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­ting that the lack of a clin­i­cal edge was a prob­lem, Arteta will also have to deal with sev­eral in­jury prob­lems ahead of Sun­day’s league trip to Manch­ester United af­ter de­fender David Luiz was forced off with a mus­cle strain.</p>
    <p>“Credit to them, they (Le­ices­ter) are re­ally or­gan­ised and it’s dif­fi­cult to cre­ate chances,” the Ar­se­nal boss said.</p>
    <p>“We cre­ated a re­ally good one with Hec­tor (Bel­lerin) and we didn’t con­vert. It’s an as­pect we have to im­prove on. We’ve lost a few play­ers in the past week or so.”</p>
    <p>That shows you the level he is at and he is a world-class player. I’m lucky to have him.</p>
