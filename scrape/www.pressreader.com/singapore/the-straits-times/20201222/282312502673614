    <p>DO­ING BUSI­NESS, DO­ING GOOD</p>
    <p>Soft­ware com­pany Ca­dence, semi­con­duc­tor gi­ant Mi­cron and global lo­gis­tics provider DHL were among 13 com­pa­nies that re­ceived awards for be­ing the best work­places in Sin­ga­pore this year.</p>
    <p>Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal was given a spe­cial ac­co­lade for re­silience dur­ing the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the awards cer­e­mony or­gan­ised by global in­sti­tute Great Place to Work yes­ter­day, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said a great com­pany to work for amid the Covid-19 pan­demic is one that takes care of the phys­i­cal and psy­cho­log­i­cal health of its staff.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo pre­sented the awards to the win­ners.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said: “A great work­place re­mem­bers, and re­spects, that each of its mem­bers may face their own pres­sures and com­mit­ments out­side of the work­place and cares for their to­tal well-be­ing.”</p>
    <p>He added: “The sec­ond qual­ity is that a great work­place is also a place that in­spires and sup­ports its em­ploy­ees to care about oth­ers – even in dif­fi­cult times.</p>
    <p>“It is com­mend­able that th­ese com­pa­nies show that they are not only here to do busi­ness, but are also here to do good. It makes th­ese work­places in­spir­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions that their em­ploy­ees are proud of.”</p>
    <p>To rank the work­places, the in­sti­tute got staff to re­spond to over 60 sur­vey ques­tions that looked at ar­eas such as trust and if the firm helped them reach their full po­ten­tial. Staff’s ex­pe­ri­ences of the com­pany’s val­ues, if they could con­trib­ute new ideas and their lead­ers’ ef­fec­tive­ness, were also con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey also looked at what lead­er­ship ac­tions firms took in re­sponse to the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The in­sti­tute col­lected 25,000 sur­vey re­sponses that rep­re­sented 62,000 em­ploy­ees in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This year’s study found that the best work­places put their staff first, en­gaged with them, and en­sured work­ers were com­fort­able shar­ing their chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Ms Eve­lyn Kwek, Great Place to Work’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for Asean and Aus­tralia-New Zealand, said: “In times of cri­sis, peo­ple rely on lead­ers to keep them grounded and in­formed. In re­sponse to the pan­demic, lead­ers at great places to work tapped the re­la­tion­ship val­ues and trust that were im­por­tant el­e­ments of their pre-pan­demic work­place cul­tures.”</p>
    <p>She added that em­ploy­ers should think beyond busi­ness op­er­a­tions and pay at­ten­tion to staff ex­pe­ri­ences, demon­strate care and em­pa­thy and con­tin­u­ally lis­ten to em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, PAP Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion (PCF), one of the win­ners, saw its man­age­ment team send­ing weekly en­cour­age­ment notes to staff. It also gave a one-off spe­cial bonus to staff and even salary in­cre­ments. Chief ex­ec­u­tive Vic­tor Bay said: “A good work­place should have a strong cul­ture of trust with open com­mu­ni­ca­tion and en­gage­ment with all staff and stake­hold­ers, and a strong prac­tice of ser­vant lead­er­ship.”</p>
    <p>PCF hu­man re­source di­vi­sion di­rec­tor Al­bert Seah agreed: “Our com­mit­ment in en­gag­ing our staff, recog­nis­ing their con­cerns and tak­ing the nec­es­sary steps to en­able them to feel safe and se­cure in their jobs had won us their sup­port and trust.”</p>
    <p>An­other win­ner was de­liv­ery ser­vice Food­panda. It gave staff a spe­cial bud­get of $300 to buy items to work from home, such as desks or head­phones. It also rolled out a pro­gramme to of­fer work­ers and their fam­i­lies free re­mote pro­fes­sional coun­selling, as well as a por­tal to pro­vide re­sources on top­ics from fit­ness to men­tal well­ness.</p>
    <p>Food­panda head of peo­ple Ingo Lauben­der said: “What has worked well in the past does not guar­an­tee suc­cess go­ing for­ward. We are en­cour­aged to chal­lenge our think­ing and in­no­vate to re­main fu­ture­proof. Em­pa­thy has to come above all, and is what we truly need to forge a strong team to tide us over un­prece­dented times.”</p>
    <p>It is com­mend­able that th­ese com­pa­nies show that they are not only here to do busi­ness, but are also here to do good. It makes th­ese work­places in­spir­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions that their em­ploy­ees are proud of.</p>
