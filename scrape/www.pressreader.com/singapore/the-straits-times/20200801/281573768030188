    <p>Most co-work­ing out­fits in Sin­ga­pore have at­tracted firms and free­lancers alike with sleek de­signs and cen­tral lo­ca­tions, but a new player is ca­ter­ing to more in­dus­trial re­quire­ments. Work­friendly – a co-work­ing space set up by Hong Kong-based self-stor­age firm Store­friendly – has opened a fa­cil­ity in Paya Le­bar.</p>
    <p>Most co-work­ing out­fits in Sin­ga­pore have at­tracted com­pa­nies and free­lancers alike with sleek de­signs and cen­tral lo­ca­tions, but a new player is ca­ter­ing to more in­dus­trial re­quire­ments, such as stor­age and lo­gis­tics ameni­ties.</p>
    <p>Work­friendly – a co-work­ing space set up by Hong Kong-based self-stor­age firm Store­friendly – has opened a fa­cil­ity in Paya Le­bar.</p>
    <p>This has proved ideal for Ms Jaslyn Goh, di­rec­tor of ve­gan food and life­style prod­uct sup­plier Souley Green.</p>
    <p>Her com­pany re­cently took up a unit, as it fit its re­quire­ments for both of­fice space and ware­hous­ing.</p>
    <p>She had con­sid­ered other cowork­ing spa­ces, but they were be­yond her bud­get and did not meet her needs.</p>
    <p>She now has ac­cess to load­ing and un­load­ing bays, pal­let jacks and trol­leys, which are nec­es­sary for dis­tri­bu­tion and ship­ping op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Goh said tak­ing up a tra­di­tional of­fice unit in an in­dus­trial build­ing had also been out of the ques­tion.</p>
    <p>“As a small busi­ness, we wouldn’t be able to af­ford such a large sum for ren­o­va­tion... (and) other fees that we would have to worry about, such as for util­i­ties, fur­ni­ture and sea­son park­ing.”</p>
    <p>Work­friendly of­fi­cially launched last month, af­ter a few months of de­lay due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. The space in­cludes hot desks, pri­vate units ca­ter­ing to both in­dus­trial and more for­mal of­fice re­quire­ments, as well as an event area.</p>
    <p>It started wel­com­ing cus­tomers in Septem­ber last year to test-bed the con­cept.</p>
    <p>TAILORED FOR SMALL BUSI­NESSES</p>
    <p>We know users need space, not just for stor­age, but for ac­tiv­ity, and that’s where Work­friendly re­ally came out... (the space is) specif­i­cally tailored for small busi­nesses that need a help­ing hand cost-wise and don’t want to pay down­town rates, but would like some­thing sim­i­lar. ’’</p>
    <p>MR JES JO­HANSEN, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Hong Kong-based self-stor­age firm Store­friendly, which ex­panded into co-work­ing units af­ter re­ceiv­ing feedback from busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Store­friendly co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Jes Jo­hansen told The Straits Times that while the firm’s core fo­cus and back­ground is in self-stor­age, it ex­panded into co-work­ing units af­ter re­ceiv­ing feedback from busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“We know users need space, not just for stor­age, but for ac­tiv­ity, and that’s where Work­friendly re­ally came out,” he said, not­ing that the feedback in­cluded re­quests for Wi-Fi, meet­ing rooms and a space where peo­ple could in­ter­act with cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>The space is “specif­i­cally tailored for small busi­nesses that need a help­ing hand cost-wise and don’t want to pay down­town rates, but would like some­thing sim­i­lar”, he added.</p>
    <p>A key fea­ture lies in its lease func­tions, pro­vid­ing users with ameni­ties such as a load­ing bay, a front desk that can as­sist with courier needs and meet­ing ar­eas, Mr Jo­hansen said.</p>
    <p>“We’re hope­ful, we’re con­fi­dent that there is a great de­mand for that kind of use,” he added, ac­knowl­edg­ing that traf­fic has been slower given the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Loretta Chen, founder of event styling firm In­vited, said the flex­i­bil­ity of space use was a draw.</p>
    <p>While the monthly rent for her Work­friendly unit is around the same as what she had been pay­ing for an of­fice space in an in­dus­trial build­ing in Bart­ley, there are more varied ar­eas avail­able for use, such as a re­cep­tion area. She also has her own ware­house space for work­ing with props and de­sign ideas.</p>
    <p>Mr Harold Koh, co-founder of con­tent pro­ducer Roar Col­lec­tive, said pric­ing was an im­por­tant fac­tor, es­pe­cially as his is a new startup. His firm was one of those that moved into Work­friendly in Septem­ber dur­ing its test-bed­ding pe­riod.</p>
    <p>A desk at WeWork, for ex­am­ple, would cost around the same as a small unit at Work­friendly, Mr Koh said, not­ing that while the Amer­i­can co-work­ing space gi­ant, like other play­ers, has its mer­its and is “fan­tas­tic for what it of­fers”, it would not have made sense for his start-up.</p>
    <p>Roar Col­lec­tive has ex­panded from its ini­tial 100 sq ft unit to one around 375 sq ft.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh noted that the flex­i­bil­ity in mov­ing be­tween units within the space has been a boon, adding that the con­ve­nience of not hav­ing to worry about set­ting up ba­sic work­ing needs such as util­i­ties and Wi-Fi was also an at­trac­tive fac­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Jo­hansen said the Work­friendly space in Paya Le­bar could be rolled out to its other self-stor­age fa­cil­i­ties here and abroad.</p>
    <p>“It’s a nat­u­ral ex­ten­sion of the ac­tiv­i­ties we have now – it al­lows us to take more space, and add value to them,” he added.</p>
