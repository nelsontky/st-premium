    <p>LON­DON • Busi­ness has been tough for Ms Mandy Yin, chef and owner of a Malaysian restau­rant and take­away in Lon­don, since she ten­ta­tively re­opened in June af­ter be­ing forced to shut down for two months dur­ing Bri­tain’s first na­tional coro­n­avirus lock­down.</p>
    <p>Ms Yin has just about man­aged to keep her eater­ies afloat, sim­pli­fy­ing menus to make them eas­ier to ex­e­cute with a smaller staff, branch­ing out into sell­ing deli items and ne­go­ti­at­ing a 50 per cent rent re­duc­tion, but it has been a ti­tanic strug­gle.</p>
    <p>“On av­er­age, tak­ings are very low,” Ms Yin said.</p>
    <p>“I see about £100 (S$177), £200 max­i­mum a day, which is not enough. It’s not sus­tain­able. But I’m try­ing to just keep go­ing to keep my staff em­ployed.”</p>
    <p>Now, with Covid-19 in­fec­tions once again ris­ing at an alarm­ing rate, comes a new ham­mer blow – a sec­ond na­tional lock­down, which started yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Over the next four weeks, cafes and restau­rants must close ex­cept to of­fer take­away food.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore the lat­est mea­sures, hospi­tal­ity was one of the hard­est-hit sec­tors in an econ­omy that shrank a record 20 per cent dur­ing the pre­vi­ous lock­down, and it has been slow to re­cover.</p>
    <p>Last month, two-thirds of busi­nesses in the sec­tor re­ported sales were still lower than a year ear­lier, com­pared with un­der half of busi­nesses in the broader econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Hospi­tal­ity work­ers have also been some of the most likely to lose their jobs.</p>
    <p>In the­ory, Ms Yin can keep go­ing with her take­away busi­ness, but she fears that in prac­tice foot­fall will tail off even fur­ther as non-es­sen­tial shops shut down and peo­ple are urged to stay at home as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness sur­vival looks un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>“I’m not go­ing to close. I’m just go­ing to keep go­ing and hope that there will be enough cus­tomers,” she said.</p>
    <p>One of the most dev­as­tat­ing as­pects of the pan­demic has been the dam­age done to busi­nesses that were not only vi­able but thriv­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Covid-19, Ms Yin’s Sam­bal Shiok restau­rant was gar­ner­ing rave re­views in na­tional news­pa­pers and bustling with an en­thu­si­as­tic clien­tele – so much so that Ms Yin was keen to ex­pand, open­ing her take­away out­let, Nasi, in March.</p>
    <p>She took out a large loan to get Nasi up and run­ning, only for it to close just four days af­ter it started.</p>
    <p>The debt has com­pounded her dif­fi­cul­ties. Mr Michael Hew­son, chief mar­ket an­a­lyst at on­line trad­ing firm CMC Markets, said the sur­vival of many small busi­nesses like Ms Yin’s would de­pend in large part on gov­ern­ment ac­tion.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has al­ready re­duced busi­ness taxes, in­tro­duced a fur­lough scheme for staff and of­fered low-in­ter­est loans and grants for es­tab­lish­ments forced to close.</p>
