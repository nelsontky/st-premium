    <p>HINOJOS (Spain) • Walk­ing into a dusty pad­dock, a young nurse is quickly sur­rounded by a group of don­keys gen­tly nudg­ing her for at­ten­tion as she strokes their soft noses and feeds them car­rots.</p>
    <p>When some­one places a 10-day­old colt in her arms, Ms Mon­ica Mo­rales squeals with de­light, vis­i­bly re­laxed af­ter a few hours un­wind­ing at El Bur­rito Feliz – The Happy Lit­tle Don­key – an as­so­ci­a­tion of­fer­ing free don­key ther­apy ses­sions to medics fight­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>Known as an­i­mal-as­sisted ther­apy, such en­coun­ters can help with a range of phys­i­cal and men­tal dis­or­ders, in­clud­ing stress, de­pres­sion and anx­i­ety. Al­though such ther­apy is more as­so­ci­ated with horses, ex­perts say don­keys are bet­ter suited to help­ing men­tal or emo­tional dis­or­ders given their gen­tle na­ture and in­tu­itive re­spect for per­sonal space.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion is quite over­whelm­ing, what we went through be­fore is now hap­pen­ing again,” says Ms Mo­rales, 25, who spent months work­ing in a Madrid hos­pi­tal when the pan­demic hit. She is now based in the south as Spain faces a sec­ond wave.</p>
    <p>“There are more and more pa­tients, and grow­ing ten­sions among col­leagues, so be­ing here with these don­keys is re­ally help­ing.”</p>
    <p>Lo­cated by a sprawl­ing for­est on the edge of An­dalu­sia’s Do­nana Na­tional Park in south­ern Spain, El Bur­rito Feliz is a non-profit as­so­ci­a­tion with 23 don­keys that have worked with Alzheimer’s pa­tients and chil­dren with prob­lems.</p>
    <p>The Doc­tor Don­key pro­ject be­gan in late June as a way of of­fer­ing respite to front-line work­ers bat­tling a virus that has killed some 33,400 peo­ple, in­fected more than 900,000 and left medics trau­ma­tised and ex­hausted.</p>
    <p>“The huge stress cre­ated through the daily strug­gle with Covid-19 ex­hausts them, so here they can be strength­ened through ther­apy with the don­keys,” ex­plains Mr Luis Be­jarano, 57, who runs El Bur­rito Feliz.</p>
    <p>Mr Be­jarano says the idea came from a book about Ja­pan’s ther­a­peu­tic forests where peo­ple spend time among trees to re­duce stress and de­pres­sion as an al­ter­na­tive to ther­apy.</p>
    <p>On­col­o­gist Mari Paz Lopez, 31, says: “The sit­u­a­tion gen­er­ates a lot of anx­i­ety and stress be­cause of the risk of get­ting in­fected, or pass­ing it on to col­leagues, fam­ily mem­bers or other pa­tients who are more frag­ile than usual.”</p>
    <p>And the risk of fall­ing ill is very</p>
    <p>They’re an­i­mals that in­spire a lot of ten­der­ness and that gen­er­ates a lot of emo­tional well-be­ing, and you for­get about the day-to-day.</p>
    <p>real, with one in 10 of Spain’s health­care work­ers get­ting in­fected – twice that of the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion and one of the high­est rates in the world.</p>
    <p>“We’ve not been of­fered any psy­cho­log­i­cal help al­though I know it ex­ists in other places,” says Dr Lopez, who works in the south­ern city of Jaen and heard about the don­key ther­apy through tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter an hour wan­der­ing through the for­est with a don­key called Ma­gal­lanes, she ad­mits to feel­ing a lot more re­laxed.</p>
    <p>“They’re an­i­mals that in­spire a lot of ten­der­ness and that gen­er­ates a lot of emo­tional well-be­ing, and you for­get about the day-to-day. I’d def­i­nitely rec­om­mend it.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­friend­ing one of the don­keys, a vis­i­tor will go on a guided walk and, when con­fi­dent, they can go back into the for­est alone with the don­key and stay as long as they like.</p>
    <p>Back at base camp, they pre­pare food for the an­i­mals, and there is the op­tion of a “don­key bath” – en­ter­ing the pad­dock for an im­mer­sive ex­pe­ri­ence with the herd.</p>
    <p>“Don­keys are very re­lat­able an­i­mals and do­ing it in a nat­u­ral en­vi­ron­ment in­creases the ben­e­fits,” says psy­chol­o­gist Maria Je­sus Arque, who was con­sulted on the pro­ject.</p>
    <p>By be­ing in a for­est and hav­ing con­tact with an an­i­mal, “some­thing hap­pens that al­lows you to ex­press your­self with an­other be­ing that does not judge”, she said.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies show that an­i­mal-as­sisted ther­apy trig­gers changes at a phys­i­o­log­i­cal level, ac­ti­vat­ing oxy­tocin, con­nected to ex­pe­ri­enc­ing plea­sure, in­creas­ing en­dor­phins and re­duc­ing cor­ti­sol in the blood which is a prod­uct of stress, she said. “And a 30-minute walk in a nat­u­ral en­vi­ron­ment, like a for­est, changes the mood.”</p>
    <p>At her surgery in Madrid, Dr Nieves Dominguez Aguero, 49, has a pen­cil sketch of a nurse nuz­zling up to a don­key by Cuban graphic artist Ram­ses Mo­rales Izquierdo as a re­minder of her visit in sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Talk­ing about the hor­rific mem­o­ries of spring still moves her to tears as she re­calls pa­tients left in the cor­ri­dors be­cause of the lack of beds and those who died with­out be­ing able to see their loved ones.</p>
    <p>“It’s very hard, not only be­cause of the pan­demic and the in­fec­tion it­self, but also be­cause of peo­ple’s sit­u­a­tions. Un­like in hos­pi­tal, when you’re a fam­ily doc­tor, you know all about these peo­ple, their lives and fam­i­lies.”</p>
    <p>Spend­ing a few hours with the don­keys was sur­pris­ingly help­ful. “It was won­der­ful, re­ally great,” she says. “Be­ing with the an­i­mals helps you re­lax a bit and the for­est is spec­tac­u­lar. It’s just a shame it’s so far away.”</p>
    <p>So far, 25 doc­tors and nurses have vis­ited the pro­ject, al­though the pace has slowed as cases have spi­ralled and Spain’s medics have found them­selves bat­tling one of the high­est in­fec­tion rates in the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Al­though the pro­ject was sup­posed to run only un­til next month, Mr Be­jarano is ex­tend­ing it and even con­sid­er­ing in­stalling lodg­ings so peo­ple can stay overnight. “It might go on for years. Let’s hope not but if that’s what’s com­ing, we must ac­cept it.”</p>
