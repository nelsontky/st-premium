    <p>Malaysia’s econ­omy con­tracted by 17.1 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter from the same pe­riod last year, hit by a global down­turn and par­tial shut­down re­sult­ing from the coron­avirus pan­demic. This is the coun­try’s worst per­for­mance since the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, when the fourth quar­ter of 1998 saw an 11.2 per cent con­trac­tion in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s econ­omy con­tracted by 17.1 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter from the same pe­riod last year, hit by a global down­turn and par­tial shut­down re­sult­ing from the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>This is the coun­try’s worst per­for­mance since the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis, when the fourth quar­ter of 1998 saw an 11.2 per cent con­trac­tion in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP).</p>
    <p>“The de­cline re­flected the un­prece­dented im­pact of the strin­gent con­tain­ment mea­sures to con­trol the Covid-19 pan­demic glob­ally and do­mes­ti­cally,” Bank Ne­gara said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s move­ment con­trol or­der im­ple­mented from March 18 to con­tain the spread of the virus re­stricted travel and shut down schools and most busi­nesses, se­verely af­fect­ing pro­duc­tion and con­sump­tion ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>With the grad­ual re­open­ing of the econ­omy since May, the cen­tral bank ex­pects GDP to im­prove, within the range of mi­nus 3.5 per cent to mi­nus 5.5 per cent this year. It ex­pects a sharp re­bound next year, with eco­nomic growth es­ti­mates at be­tween 5.5 per cent and 8 per cent.</p>
    <p>“The econ­omy is poised for a re­cov­ery in the sec­ond half and will re­bound fur­ther in 2021,” Bank Ne­gara gov­er­nor Nor Sham­siah Mohd Yunus told a vir­tual news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She added that the data sug­gests that the eco­nomic fall­out was at its worst in April, dur­ing the height of the coron­avirus con­tain­ment re­stric­tions. In the first quar­ter of this year, the econ­omy man­aged to post mar­ginal growth of 0.7 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>A sharp de­cline was seen in April when GDP con­tracted 28.6 per cent, while it im­proved in May to neg­a­tive 19.5 per cent and con­tin­ued to fur­ther im­prove in June by reg­is­ter­ing a smaller con­trac­tion of 3.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>On the pro­duc­tion side, all sec­tors recorded neg­a­tive growth with the ex­cep­tion of the agri­cul­ture sec­tor.</p>
    <p>A sig­nif­i­cant de­cline in tourist ar­rivals amid in­ter­na­tional travel re­stric­tions contribute­d to the con­trac­tion in the ser­vice sec­tor, said the De­part­ment of Statis­tics’ chief statis­ti­cian Mohd Uzir Mahidin.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice and man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tors recorded neg­a­tive 16.2 per cent and neg­a­tive 18.3 per cent growth, re­spec­tively, while the con­struc­tion sec­tor shrank 44.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Other in­di­ca­tors such as sales and ve­hi­cles reg­is­tra­tion de­clined sharply for April and May.</p>
    <p>Key driv­ers ex­pected to boost the econ­omy in­clude the re­open­ing of the do­mes­tic econ­omy, stim­u­lus mea­sures and large pub­lic trans­porta­tion projects.</p>
    <p>The unemployme­nt rate, which in­creased in the sec­ond quar­ter to 5.1 per cent from 3.5 per cent in the first quar­ter, is also ex­pected to im­prove in line with the re­cov­ery in eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>“I am cau­tiously op­ti­mistic that the worst is be­hind us,” said Datuk Nor Sham­siah.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has recorded a to­tal of 9,149 cases of Covid-19 and 125 deaths since the start of the out­break, with 20 new cases con­firmed yes­ter­day.</p>
