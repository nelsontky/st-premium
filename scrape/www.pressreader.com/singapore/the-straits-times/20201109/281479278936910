    <p>Just be­cause re­search shows that printed books are bet­ter than ebooks for young chil­dren, it does not mean that par­ents should never use e-books to en­gage their kids.</p>
    <p>Read­ing ex­perts say e-books can be a good change from printed books – they are a dif­fer­ent and fun way for chil­dren to en­joy read­ing, ex­pe­ri­ence sto­ries and learn in­for­ma­tion. Here is ad­vice on how to use e-books well.</p>
    <p>• Your child will get the most ben­e­fit from an e-book when you join him in read­ing it. So, sit close to your child and swipe the pages of the book to­gether.</p>
    <p>• If there is a nar­ra­tion of the story, turn it off and read the text to your child first.</p>
    <p>• As you read the story, talk about the story, fo­cus­ing on the parts that he is most in­ter­ested in and ask open-ended ques­tions – for ex­am­ple, “What do you think will hap­pen next?”</p>
    <p>Fo­cus on the story, rather than on the de­vice.</p>
    <p>• It is okay to use the in­ter­ac­tive el­e­ments in the story as and when it helps to “scaf­fold the story”, but switch off an­i­ma­tion and games if you think they are dis­tract­ing your child.</p>
    <p>• Help your child learn to use the e-book – for ex­am­ple, by show­ing him how to swipe, scroll and use the in­ter­ac­tive fea­tures, but do not get caught up in it.</p>
    <p>• Watch for signs your child is get­ting dis­tracted or los­ing in­ter­est. It might be time to put the ebook away or try a dif­fer­ent kind of book.</p>
    <p>• For bed­time sto­ries, tra­di­tional print books are the best as they help your child re­lax and get ready for sleep. If you want to use e-books close to bed­time, it is best to avoid e-books that have too many in­ter­ac­tive el­e­ments, which might over­stim­u­late your child.</p>
    <p>• It is also a good idea to use an e-read­ing de­vice that lets you min­imise blue light. Blue light can make it harder to get to sleep be­cause it tricks the brain into think­ing it is day­time. Some de­vices have a night shift or night-light set­ting, that changes the light the de­vice emits.</p>
