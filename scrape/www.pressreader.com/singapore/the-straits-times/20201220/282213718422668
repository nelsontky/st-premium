    <p>In nor­mal times, peo­ple belly­ache about air­plane food. We roll our eyes, we take our own food on board, we rush out of the plane in a stopover to find de­cent grub.</p>
    <p>But th­ese are not nor­mal times. And we went mad for Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) food.</p>
    <p>Much of its fleet, the pride of Sin­ga­pore, is grounded. But the air­line hit gold when it started of­fer­ing its first- and busi­ness­class meals for de­liv­ery to homes.</p>
    <p>And be­cause SIA al­ways does things right, it went out of its way to make cus­tomers feel spe­cial. In­cluded with the meals are amenity kits, spe­cially cu­rated playlists and even vir­tual tours of air­plane cab­ins.</p>
    <p>The first-class, all-in­clu­sive pack­age is priced at $888 and in­cludes a bot­tle of cham­pagne, a bot­tle of red or white Bur­gundy wine, a 12-piece set of Wedg­wood bone china table­ware, a six-piece set of Lalique crys­tal glasses and three amenity kits.</p>
    <p>Or­ders started rolling in min­utes af­ter the or­der­ing site went live on­line in the dead of the night.</p>
    <p>When SIA launched Restau­rant A380, in which peo­ple can book seats on two Air­bus planes and have a meal on the sta­tion­ary air­craft, things went crazy.</p>
    <p>The first lot of seats for lunch sold out in 30 min­utes. Ad­di­tional seats for lunch and din­ner went fast.</p>
    <p>Prices ranged from $50 a per­son in the econ­omy cabin to $600 a per­son for those sit­ting in suites.</p>
    <p>It is a rare chance for reg­u­lar folk to get a taste of what first-class travel is like, and eat food con­ceived by chefs such as Sin­ga­pore’s Sher­may Lee, Aus­tralia’s Matt Mo­ran, In­dia’s Sanjeev Kapoor, Ja­pan’s Yoshi­hiro Mu­rata and France’s Ge­orges Blanc.</p>
    <p>And the sig­na­ture sa­tay that only high-fliers get on board.</p>

        <p data-role="text">The first- and business-class meals (above) de&#xAD;liv&#xAD;ered to homes are the very ones served aboard Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore Air&#xAD;lines&#x2019; flights and were de&#xAD;signed by its panel of renowned chefs.</p>
