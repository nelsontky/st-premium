    <p>The pan­demic is ex­pected to dras­ti­cally re­shape com­mer­cial real es­tate, leav­ing thou­sands of va­cant and un­der­used spa­ces na­tion­wide. But some de­vel­op­ers and in­vestors are keen to seize the chance to con­vert those prop­er­ties into other uses.</p>
    <p>Lord & Tay­lor’s flag­ship de­part­ment store in Man­hat­tan, for ex­am­ple, will soon house of­fice work­ers for Ama­zon, and a tourist des­ti­na­tion in the heart of Hol­ly­wood is get­ting a US$100 mil­lion (S$136 mil­lion) facelift that in­cludes con­vert­ing un­der­used re­tail spa­ces into of­fices.</p>
    <p>“No­body ever lets a cri­sis get in the way of cre­at­ing op­por­tu­nity,” said Ms Sheila Botting of Avi­son Young, a com­mer­cial real es­tate ser­vices firm in Toronto.</p>
    <p>In re­tail alone, at l east 7,700 stores to­talling 115 mil­lion sq ft were ex­pected to close this year as of early last month, ac­cord­ing to data pro­vided by CoStar Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices. Most of these clo­sures will be in malls, which were strug­gling long be­fore the pan­demic pushed de­part­ment stores such as JCPen­ney, Neiman Mar­cus and Sears into bank­ruptcy.</p>
    <p>At the same time, 172.7 mil­lion sq ft of Class A of­fice space, typ­i­cally the high­est qual­ity, is ex­pected to come on­line this year and next. Only 59 per cent of it has been leased, below the av­er­age of 74 per cent, ac­cord­ing to the CoStar data. And nearly one in four ho­tels na­tion­wide faces pos­si­ble fore­clo­sure as own­ers fall be­hind at least a month on loans, the Amer­i­can Ho­tel & Lodg­ing As­so­ci­a­tion said.</p>
    <p>Sim­ply put, a lot more space is go­ing to be avail­able out there.</p>
    <p>Also, busi­nesses that use of­fices have been pulling back on space amid ris­ing dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and other ef­fi­cien­cies, as well as de­mo­graphic shifts – younger gen­er­a­tions in gen­eral are com­fort­able with less of­fice space.</p>
    <p>The com­mer­cial real es­tate in­dus­try’s rule of thumb in the 1980s was 200 to 300 sq ft per em­ployee, ac­cord­ing to Moody’s An­a­lyt­ics. By last year, the av­er­age had fallen to 126.5 sq ft.</p>
    <p>And in­dus­tries as di­verse as real es­tate, me­dia, tech­nol­ogy and bank­ing have been flirt­ing with more telecom­mut­ing for decades. More­over, a size­able chunk of leased space goes largely un­used dur­ing the work­day any­way – es­ti­mates place it at 30 per cent to 40 per cent – as peo­ple are out of the of­fice for var­i­ous rea­sons.</p>
    <p>But the cri­sis has cre­ated a chance for some de­vel­op­ers to re­assess their strat­egy.</p>
    <p>“This rep­re­sents a mo­ment in time to think about cur­rent as­sets, how they’re be­ing used and what fu­ture op­tions might be,” Ms Botting said.</p>
    <p>The stark­est ex­am­ple yet of this ap­proach might be Ama­zon’s pos­si­ble plans to con­vert JCPen­ney and Sears stores in shop­ping cen­tres owned by mall op­er­a­tor Si­mon Prop­erty Group into dis­tri­bu­tion ware­houses.</p>
    <p>The e-com­merce gi­ant is also be­hind the over­haul of the shut­tered Lord & Tay­lor store on Fifth Av­enue, turn­ing 676,000 sq ft into of­fice space for about 2,000 em­ploy­ees by 2023.</p>
    <p>SIL­VER LIN­ING</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers also see an op­por­tu­nity in con­vert­ing ho­tels into con­tin­u­ing care re­tire­ment com­mu­ni­ties. Mr David Reis, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Se­nior Care De­vel­op­ment in Harrison, New York, said it is less ex­pen­sive to con­vert a prop­erty than</p>
    <p>build from the ground up.</p>
    <p>De­spite the po­ten­tial for lower costs and the emerging uni­verse of op­tions, com­mer­cial real es­tate con­ver­sions do pose chal­lenges. Zon­ing and tech­ni­cal de­sign can stymie some changeover­s.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tion­ally, the best con­ver­sions have in­creas­ingly been ob­so­lete prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>“Typ­i­cally, if they’re older and they’ve gone be­yond their use­ful life – re­duced oc­cu­pancy, re­duced cash flow – they are ripe for trans­for­ma­tion,” Ms Botting said.</p>
    <p>But even newer prop­er­ties are on the ta­ble. Neiman Mar­cus opened a 188,000 sq ft flag­ship store at Man­hat­tan’s Hud­son Yards just last year as the an­chor re­tail tenant in the na­tion’s largest pri­vate real es­tate de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Now, the Re­lated Com­pa­nies,</p>
    <p>owner of Hud­son Yards, is piv­ot­ing. Mr Philippe Visser, pres­i­dent of Re­lated Of­fice De­vel­op­ment, said the store would be­come “the most ex­cit­ing of­fice op­por­tu­nity in New York City”. The move harks to pre­vi­ous crises that forced a meta­mor­pho­sis in com­mer­cial real es­tate.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, Lower Man­hat­tan was racked by high of­fice va­can­cies and pop­u­la­tion drain, and Mr William Rudin, pres­i­dent of New York land­lord Rudin Man­age­ment, helped lead ef­forts to re­ju­ve­nate the area. From 1995 to 2001, more than 4.6 mil­lion sq ft was con­verted – in­clud­ing glassy of­fice build­ings no one thought would make de­cent apart­ments.</p>
    <p>“When things get bad enough,” Mr Rudin said, “it forces peo­ple to come to­gether and come up with ideas.”</p>
    <p>No­body ever lets a cri­sis get in the way of cre­at­ing op­por­tu­nity.</p>
