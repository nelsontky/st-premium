    <p>PETALING JAYA • Malaysians will soon have to bid zai jian (farewell) to the sec­ond gi­ant panda cub born in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Yi Yi’s re­turn to China is pend­ing con­fir­ma­tion from the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Dr Mat Naim Ramli, di­rec­tor of the Zo­ol­ogy, Ve­teri­nary Hos­pi­tal and Gi­ant Panda Con­ser­va­tion Cen­tre, said that dur­ing its last dis­cus­sion with the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties, the Malaysian side was told to wait un­til Novem­ber or De­cem­ber to fi­nalise the date for Yi Yi’s re­turn.</p>
    <p>“Once the date has been con­firmed, the gov­ern­ment will make the an­nounce­ment,” he said when con­tacted on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Mat Naim added that due to Covid-19 con­cerns, the pre­lim­i­nary dis­cus­sions had cen­tred on send­ing Yi Yi to China with­out a travel com­pan­ion.</p>
    <p>“We also sug­gested that Yi Yi be ac­com­pa­nied on the flight there and, upon land­ing in China, she would be re­ceived by the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties. This way, the com­pan­ions need not dis­em­bark from the air­craft and they can re­turn to Malaysia straight away.”</p>
    <p>He added, how­ever, that this would de­pend on whether the cargo-han­dling com­pany would al­low such a pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>“The pro­ce­dure will not be fi­nalised un­til there is con­fir­ma­tion from the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties on the date for Yi Yi’s re­turn,” he said.</p>
    <p>Born i n Jan­uary 2018, Yi Yi, whose name means friend­ship, cur­rently weighs 88kg.</p>
    <p>Bam­boo and fruit are the favourite treats of the fe­male cub, the sec­ond off­spring of Xing Xing and Liang Liang.</p>
    <p>The panda cou­ple, who are on a 10-year loan from China, ar­rived in Malaysia in 2014 to mark 40 years of di­plo­matic ties be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Their first cub, Nuan Nuan, was re­turned to China in Novem­ber 2017 af­ter she turned two.</p>
    <p>Dr Mat Naim had ac­com­pa­nied Nuan Nuan on her trip back home.</p>
    <p>The cub was then sent to the Du­jiangyan Re­search Base of Gi­ant</p>
    <p>Panda Breed­ing in Sichuan prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Malaysia-China Gi­ant Panda In­ter­na­tional Con­ser­va­tion</p>
    <p>Agree­ment, any panda cub born in Malaysia is to be re­turned to China at the age of two.</p>
