    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) has weighed in on a so­cial me­dia post on the plight of an el­derly worker, which drew at­ten­tion to how much she was paid.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, the MSF said that while it ap­pre­ci­ated the ef­forts of the pub­lic in help­ing those in need, post­ing about them on so­cial me­dia may lead to fur­ther dis­tress for them, and may also not cor­rectly re­flect their cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>“Build­ing an in­clu­sive and a car­ing so­ci­ety is a col­lec­tive ef­fort. We ap­pre­ci­ate the ef­fort of mem­bers of the pub­lic in reach­ing out to those who seem to be in need,” it said. “How­ever, post­ing and shar­ing their cir­cum­stances on so­cial me­dia may lead to fur­ther dis­tress for these vul­ner­a­ble groups of peo­ple and their fam­i­lies. Such posts may not cor­rectly re­flect the cir­cum­stances of vul­ner­a­ble groups of peo­ple, who may be el­derly, or may not share all the de­tails ac­cu­rately be­cause of the stres­sors they are fac­ing.”</p>
    <p>The MSF en­cour­aged the pub­lic in­stead to link in­di­vid­u­als up with a So­cial Ser­vice Of­fice (SSO) or Fam­ily Ser­vice Cen­tre, to seek help.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, a so­cial me­dia user posted on his pub­lic Twit­ter ac­count his en­counter on the train with an el­derly wo­man who works as a cleaner. Mr Koh Meng Shuen quoted her as say­ing that she was seek­ing ad­di­tional em­ploy­ment to earn a liv­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to his post, she said she earned just $5 per hour work­ing as a cleaner at the hawker cen­tre at Our Tampines Hub. She also told him she lived with two friends in a flat, and strug­gled to make ends meet af­ter los­ing both her hus­band and only son.</p>
    <p>MSF said that SSO of­fi­cers iden­ti­fied the wo­man, whom they called “Mdm L”, and vis­ited her on Tues­day to see what help or sup­port they could ren­der.</p>
    <p>It added that she “in­di­cated she was un­aware of be­ing pho­tographed or that her com­ments and photo would be shared in pub­lic on so­cial me­dia”.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said Mdm L has a younger son and lives in a five-room flat with his fam­ily. “The fam­ily has a do­mes­tic helper. Her son pro­vides her with food and shel­ter but she works to sup­ple­ment her other ex­penses.”</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of De­fence (Min­def) con­firmed that Mdm L’s elder son, a reg­u­lar war­rant of­fi­cer, died dur­ing a Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces (SAF) freefall train­ing ses­sion in South Africa in May 2009. “Full com­pen­sa­tion was paid out to his fam­ily. Min­def and the SAF ex­tend their deep­est con­do­lences to the fam­ily,” said MSF in its post.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker kicked in on April 7 this year, Mdm L re­ceived a monthly gross salary of about $1,300, ex­clud­ing Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) de­duc­tions, the MSF said.</p>
    <p>“Due to re­duced busi­ness vol­ume, her em­ployer had ar­ranged for her and other full-time em­ploy­ees to work part-time as a way to re­tain staff. She is cur­rently paid $675 for work­ing part-time in 4-hour shifts (or about $6.50/hr),” it added. “We un­der­stand from her em­ployer that when busi­ness im­proves, they will re­view and re­in­state the clean­ers’ part-time em­ploy­ment to full-time.”</p>
    <p>To help with her lost wages dur­ing this pe­riod, she is be­ing as­sessed for the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant, which pro­vides be­tween $500 and $800 monthly.</p>
    <p>Mdm L is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent and has not ap­plied for Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen­ship, so she does not qual­ify for schemes like the Sil­ver Sup­port or Work­fare, MSF said. How­ever, she re­ceives ben­e­fits like the Sol­i­dar­ity Pay­ment that are also ex­tended to PRs. “In ad­di­tion, we will sup­port her in other ways. Grass­roots or­gan­i­sa­tions will sup­port her with $120 food vouch­ers monthly for the next six months. We are also ar­rang­ing for her to get some help for her med­i­cal ex­penses,” it added.</p>
    <p>Last night, Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan Chuan-Jin urged peo­ple to stop look­ing for Mdm L at her home or work­place, as she and her fam­ily were in “sig­nif­i­cant dis­tress” by the pub­lic­ity.</p>
