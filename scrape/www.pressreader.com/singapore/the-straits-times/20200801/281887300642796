    <p>A month af­ter the In­dian gov­ern­ment blocked 59 Chi­nese apps, in­clud­ing the wildly pop­u­lar TikTok, users in In­dia have taken to other apps from China that have emerged as pop­u­lar al­ter­na­tives to those that were banned.</p>
    <p>These in­clude Zili, a video-shar­ing app from China’s Xiaomi, which has es­tab­lished it­self as one of the top three al­ter­na­tives to TikTok, the home-grown Ro­poso and the US-based Dub­s­mash.</p>
    <p>To­gether, these three apps have gen­er­ated 21.8 mil­lion down­loads in In­dia since the ban, ac­cord­ing to a July 23 re­port from app track­ing firm Sen­sor Tower.</p>
    <p>In the three weeks fol­low­ing the ban on June 29, Zili grew by 167 per cent with nearly eight mil­lion in­stalls, up from about three mil­lion in the cor­re­spond­ing pe­riod prior to the ban.</p>
    <p>An­other Chi­nese app, Snack Video, from de­vel­oper Kuaishou, was down­loaded about 10 mil­lion times be­tween June 29 and July 19, a dra­matic rise from just 172,000 be­tween June 8 and June 28, ac­cord­ing to the re­port.</p>
    <p>The con­tin­ued strong ap­peal of Chi­nese apps prompted a sec­ond round of bans by the In­dian gov­ern­ment last week. The Min­istry of Elec­tronic and In­for­ma­tion Tech­nol­ogy banned 47 apps on July 24 that were de­scribed as clones or vari­ants of the 59 apps that were blocked in June fol­low­ing a clash be­tween In­dian and Chi­nese sol­diers in Ladakh that left 20 sol­diers dead.</p>
    <p>A full list of the 47 apps is yet to be re­leased of­fi­cially but ANI, a news agency, re­ported that these in­clude TikTok Lite, Helo Lite, SHAREit Lite, BIGO LIVE Lite, and VFY Lite.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s me­dia has re­ported that the gov­ern­ment has drawn up a list of 275 other China-linked apps as it ramps up its scrutiny for any signs of threat to na­tional se­cu­rity and user pri­vacy by such apps. Zili and Snack Video were avail­able for down­load in In­dia on Google’s Play Store on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Blaise Fer­nan­des, di­rec­tor of Gate­way House, a Mum­bai-based think-tank, told The Straits Times by e-mail that the app ecosys­tem is dy­namic and the ap­pear­ance of clones of banned apps is “par for the course”.</p>
    <p>In­dia, he pointed out, fol­lows the rule of law, ban­ning apps that vi­o­late the law or are seen as a se­cu­rity threat. “Like in any vi­brant democ­racy, due pro­cesses are fol­lowed – these pro­cesses are signs that rule of law ap­plies and de­ci­sions are not ar­bi­trary,” Mr Fer­nan­des said.</p>
    <p>While an­nounc­ing the first ban on Chi­nese apps in June, the gov­ern­ment ac­cused them of “steal­ing and sur­rep­ti­tiously trans­mit­ting users’ data in an unau­tho­rised man­ner” to servers out­side In­dia.</p>
    <p>But most smart­phone users in In­dia re­main un­aware of the in­tri­ca­cies re­lated to on­line pri­vacy and se­cu­rity or, for that mat­ter, even the prove­nance of apps they down­load on their phones and their fi­nan­cial back­ers.</p>
    <p>“For most users, their sup­port for the ban was more an ex­pres­sion of their anti-China sen­ti­ment rather than a show of con­cern for pos­si­ble vi­o­la­tion of their pri­vacy,” said Mr Tarun Pathak, an as­so­ci­ate di­rec­tor with Counterpoi­nt Re­search.</p>
    <p>Ban­ning apps from China has been an easy crowd-pleas­ing de­ci­sion for the gov­ern­ment, with some in the me­dia even laud­ing it as a “dig­i­tal strike”.</p>
    <p>But the im­ple­men­ta­tion of fur­ther bans on the 275 China-linked apps may be more chal­leng­ing for the gov­ern­ment. The list of these apps un­der scrutiny, ac­cord­ing to The Eco­nomic Times in In­dia, in­cludes the Ten­cent Hold­ings­backed pop­u­lar on­line game, Play­erUn­known’s Bat­tle­grounds (PUBG).</p>
    <p>PUBG Mo­bile has been in­stalled over 175 mil­lion times in In­dia, around 24 per cent of the game’s to­tal in­stalls, ac­cord­ing to Sen­sor Tower. Oth­ers in the list of 275 apps are Zili by Xiaomi, AliEx­press from e-com­merce gi­ant Alibaba and TikTok-owner ByteDance’s mu­sic stream­ing app Resso.</p>
    <p>“To­gether, this mas­sive num­ber of apps can easily ac­count for more than 200 mil­lion ac­tive users, which is close to 40 per cent of the smart­phone user base in In­dia,” said Mr Pathak.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment will have to there­fore come out with very solid rea­son­ing (for a ban), in­clud­ing at least some de­tails of spe­cific in­stances of vi­o­la­tion by these firms. Just an anti-China sen­ti­ment will not cut it this time.”</p>
    <p>China, mean­while, has threat­ened re­tal­i­a­tion. Call­ing In­dia’s moves to ban the apps “de­lib­er­ate in­ter­fer­ence”, a spokesman for the Chi­nese Em­bassy in In­dia said on Tues­day that Bei­jing will take “nec­es­sary mea­sures to safe­guard the le­git­i­mate rights and in­ter­ests of Chi­nese com­pa­nies”.</p>
