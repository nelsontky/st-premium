Dynamic Duo featuring BewhY POP
DON’T TOUCH ME Refund Sisters
Hear it on: Spotify, Apple Music and other music streaming platforms Watch it on: bit.ly/3kh7VpK The nine-member South Korean group have been steadily moving away from their cute-schoolgirl image in their early days and their new album Eyes Wide Open continues on that path.
It leads with the confident
I Can’t Stop Me, which declares: “Across from each other/you and I exchange glances/wanna feel the thrilling highlight”. Hear it on: Spotify, Apple Music and other music streaming platforms
Watch it on: str.sg/JLWv This reflective and rap-centric song pairs veteran South Korean hip-hop group Dynamic Duo, comprising Gaeko and Choiza, with up-and-coming rapper BewhY.
Their three rap styles blend smoothly. 5 ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK HOMURA (FLAME) LiSA
Hear it on: Spotify, Apple Music and other music streaming platforms
Watch it on: str.sg/JLmk It is no surprise that Japanese singer LiSA’s latest song Homura has stayed at the top of music charts in her home country since its release. It is the theme song of Japan’s record-smashing hit anime movie, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba The Movie: Infinity Train.
LiSA, whose music has often been used for anime themes, nails it in this new release with her emotional delivery. 8 HIP-HOP TAKE Mino
Hear it on: Spotify, Apple Music and other music streaming platforms Watch it on: str.sg/JLmY Rapper Mino from South Korean boy band Winner returns with his first solo album in two years.

Hear it on: Spotify, Apple Music and other music streaming platforms
Watch it on: str.sg/JLmZ On first listen, this song by Japanese band King Gnu sounds like it was sung by a woman, but the beautifull­y clear, high and almost operatic delivery is by vocalist Satoru Iguchi, giving the song an ethereal, haunting feel.
The four-man group’s instrument­als are also extraordin­ary, lending the song orchestral gravitas. 7 POP POP TRAVEL Mamamoo
Hear it on: Spotify, Apple Music and other music streaming platforms
Watch it on: str.sg/JLm3 The K-pop quartet have always had a talent for infusing pop songs with personalit­y and their new album Travel is no different.
The exotic-sounding Aya comes close to sounding repetitive until it takes a hard left turn near the end, surprising listeners with an unexpected and complete switch in musical direction. PHOTOS: JESSICAH_O/ INSTAGRAM, TWICETAGRA­M/ INSTAGRAM, IM___LTM/ INSTAGRAM 10 POP
