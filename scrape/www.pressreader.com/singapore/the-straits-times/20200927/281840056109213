    <p>BEI­JING • China has urged the United States to im­me­di­ately stop slan­der­ing Chi­nese diplo­matic mis­sions and their per­son­nel in the US, say­ing it will take nec­es­sary coun­ter­mea­sures in ac­cor­dance with any fur­ther ac­tions by Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin made the re­mark on</p>
    <p>Friday af­ter US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo told the New York Post in a re­cent interview that China’s New York con­sulate gen­eral is be­ing used as a ma­jor hub for the na­tion’s US es­pi­onage ef­forts, and it is likely more diplo­mats and agents will be ar­rested.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s re­marks fol­lowed an ear­lier me­dia re­port that an eth­nic Ti­betan po­lice of­fi­cer in New York had been ar­rested on charges of spy­ing for Bei­jing and he re­port­edly worked for un­named han­dlers from the Chi­nese con­sulate gen­eral in New York.</p>
    <p>The US shut down the Chi­nese con­sulate gen­eral in Hous­ton in July. Soon af­ter that, China closed the US con­sulate gen­eral in Chengdu, Sichuan prov­ince, amid wors­en­ing bi­lat­eral ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s ac­cu­sa­tion against Chi­nese diplo­matic mis­sions and per­son­nel in the US is ground­less and ir­re­spon­si­ble, Mr Wang told a reg­u­lar news brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese diplo­matic mis­sions and their per­son­nel in the US have al­ways acted in ac­cor­dance with the Vi­enna Con­ven­tion on Diplo­matic Re­la­tions, the Vi­enna Con­ven­tion on Con­sular Re­la­tions as well as the con­sular treaties be­tween the two na­tions, Mr Wang said.</p>
    <p>China urged the US to stop tar­nish­ing Chi­nese diplo­matic mis­sions and their per­son­nel in the US, re­frain from stir­ring up trou­ble and pro­vide con­ve­nience for their per­for­mance of du­ties.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, a New York City po­lice of­fi­cer was charged by fed­eral pros­e­cu­tors with aid­ing the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s sur­veil­lance of Ti­betan na­tion­als liv­ing in the city.</p>
    <p>Baimada­jie Ang­wang, 33, a nat­u­ralised US cit­i­zen who was born in China, was charged with act­ing as an un­reg­is­tered for­eign agent, along with wire fraud, mak­ing false state­ments and ob­struc­tion of a na­tional se­cu­rity back­ground in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the De­fence Depart­ment, ac­cord­ing to a crim­i­nal com­plaint by US At­tor­ney Seth DuCharme.</p>
    <p>On Friday, the Chi­nese con­sulate gen­eral in New York said in a state­ment that there has never been any es­pi­onage ac­tiv­ity and that it has been pro­mot­ing mu­tual un­der­stand­ing, co­op­er­a­tion and friend­ship be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Last year, trade in goods be­tween China and the 10 states in its con­sular district ac­counted for about 15 per cent of that be­tween China and the US; the num­ber of Chi­nese stu­dents study­ing in its con­sular district was about 150,000; and the num­ber of tourists from China vis­it­ing New York City in­creased to 1.1 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The US de­lib­er­ately dis­torts nor­mal ex­changes be­tween the con­sulate and its con­sular district with the false ac­cu­sa­tion, which is ob­vi­ously ground­less,” it said.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s ac­cu­sa­tion against Chi­nese diplo­matic mis­sions and per­son­nel in the US is ground­less and ir­re­spon­si­ble, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin told a reg­u­lar news brief­ing.</p>
