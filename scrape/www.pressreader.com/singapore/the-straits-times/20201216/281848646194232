    <p>• A Wall Street Jour­nal opin­ion piece crit­i­cis­ing in­com­ing first lady Jill Bi­den’s use of the ti­tle “Dr” be­cause she holds a PhD i n ed­u­ca­tion sci­ences, rather than a med­i­cal de­gree, has caused wide­spread ou­trage in the United States, in­clud­ing from pre­de­ces­sor Michelle Obama.</p>
    <p>The Jour­nal ar­ti­cle, pub­lished last Satur­day, has been panned for its at­tack on Dr Bi­den, who earned her Doc­tor of Ed­u­ca­tion in 2007 and plans to keep teach­ing dur­ing her hus­band Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den’s time in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Col­umn au­thor Joseph Ep­stein was ac­cused of pa­tro­n­is­ing Dr Bi­den when he re­ferred to her as “kiddo” and sug­gested her us­ing the ti­tle was “fraud­u­lent” and “a touch comic”.</p>
    <p>The at­tack stirred fierce de­bate, and on Mon­day, Mrs Obama joined the ranks of those de­fend­ing the spouse of her hus­band’s vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“For eight years, I saw Dr Jill Bi­den do what a lot of pro­fes­sional women do – suc­cess­fully man­age more than one re­spon­si­bil­ity at a time, from her teach­ing du­ties to her of­fi­cial obli­ga­tions in the White House to her roles as a mother, wife and friend,” she wrote in a post on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“And right now, we’re all see­ing what also hap­pens to so many pro­fes­sional women, whether their ti­tles are Dr, Ms, Mrs, or even First Lady: All too of­ten, our ac­com­plish­ments are met with scep­ti­cism, even de­ri­sion.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter decades of work, we’re forced to prove our­selves all over again,” Mrs Obama said.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael LaRosa, Dr Bi­den’s spokesman, told the news­pa­per on Twit­ter that “if you had any re­spect for women at all, you would re­move this re­pug­nant dis­play of chau­vin­ism from your pa­per and apol­o­gise to her.”</p>
    <p>Dr Bi­den her­self re­sponded in­di­rectly on Sun­day when she tweeted: “To­gether, we will build a world where the achieve­ments of our daugh­ters will be cel­e­brated rather than den­i­grated.”</p>
    <p>North­west­ern Univer­sity, where Mr Ep­stein had taught un­til 2003, was quick to dis­tance it­self from him, say­ing in a state­ment that the ar­ti­cle “casts un­mer­ited as­per­sion on Dr Jill Bi­den’s right­ful pub­lic claim­ing of her doc­toral cre­den­tials and ex­per­tise”.</p>
    <p>And Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton, both a former first lady and former sec­re­tary of state, sim­ply tweeted: “Her name is Dr Jill Bi­den, get over your­self!”</p>
    <p>UN­FAIR TREAT­MENT</p>
    <p>And right now, we’re all see­ing what also hap­pens to so many pro­fes­sional women, whether their ti­tles are Dr, Ms, Mrs, or even First Lady: All too of­ten, our ac­com­plish­ments are met with scep­ti­cism, even de­ri­sion.</p>
    <p>MRS MICHELLE OBAMA, former first lady.</p>
