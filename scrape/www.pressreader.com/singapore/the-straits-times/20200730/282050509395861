    <p>We’ll prob­a­bly never know ex­actly what sorts of doc­u­ments were in­cin­er­ated at China’s con­sulate in Hous­ton in the days be­fore the United States forced it to close last Fri­day, af­ter ac­cus­ing it of be­ing a hub of espionage.</p>
    <p>We may also never know what caused this month’s cat­a­strophic fire aboard the USS Bon­homme Richard, a mas­sive am­phibi­ous as­sault ship that was be­ing fit­ted out to dou­ble as a small air­craft car­rier, in the port of San Diego.</p>
    <p>What we should know is that the two fires are ac­tu­ally one. We are rac­ing to­wards a con­flict with China we may be ill-pre­pared to wage.</p>
    <p>The clo­sure of the con­sulate comes on the heels of a quad of bel­li­cose speeches from top ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials, col­lec­tively amount­ing to a dec­la­ra­tion of Cold War against China. Na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Robert O’Brien painted China’s lead­er­ship as un­re­con­structed Marx­ist-Lenin­ists.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) di­rec­tor Christo­pher Wray spoke of China’s prac­tice in the art of “ma­lign for­eign influence”.</p>
    <p>At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Bill Barr ac­cused China of “eco­nomic blitzkrieg”. And Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo hinted the free world may need a new ver­sion of Nato, this one aimed at Bei­jing in­stead of Moscow.</p>
    <p>Given that the source is Team Trump and the tim­ing is an elec­tion year, it’s tempt­ing to dis­miss the speeches’ warn­ings as cyn­i­cal, hyp­o­crit­i­cal, po­lit­i­cal – and there­fore wrong. Why com­plain about civil lib­er­ties in Hong Kong when we have goon squads in Port­land? Why ac­cuse China of trash­ing global norms when that’s been Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s am­bi­tion from the be­gin­ning?</p>
    <p>Why char­ac­terise Chi­nese</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping as a lin­ear ide­o­log­i­cal de­scen­dant of Joseph Stalin when, as we know from for­mer na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser John Bolton, Mr Trump was ful­somely prais­ing him and so­lic­it­ing his help for his re-elec­tion bid? And why all of this now, when Mr Trump needs en­e­mies both for­eign and do­mes­tic to res­cue his flag­ging re-elec­tion bid?</p>
    <p>But the prob­lem with these ques­tions is that – how­ever on point they are as crit­i­cisms of Mr Trump – they ob­scure two hard facts a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will also con­front.</p>
    <p>The first is that, un­der Mr Xi, China has be­come dras­ti­cally more re­pres­sive at home, more ag­gres­sive abroad and more shame­less about both than at nearly any point since the death of Mao Ze­dong.</p>
    <p>This is not a mat­ter of Bei­jing re­act­ing badly to Mr Trump (as the early Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion er­ro­neously sup­posed that bad re­la­tions with Russia were a mat­ter of Moscow re­act­ing badly to for­mer US pres­i­dent Ge­orge W. Bush).</p>
    <p>Some of China’s big­gest dig­i­tal heists date to the Obama years – in­clud­ing the 2015 hack of the Of­fice of Per­son­nel Man­age­ment, which gave Bei­jing the back­ground se­cu­rity files for nearly 22 mil­lion cur­rent or for­mer US gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ees and their fam­ily mem­bers. China’s out­ra­geous and il­le­gal claims to most of the South China Sea also pre­date Mr Trump and will fes­ter long af­ter he’s gone.</p>
    <p>What stands out now is just how brazen Bei­jing has be­come. Take one de­tail from Mr Wray’s speech: “We have now reached the point where the FBI is open­ing a new China-re­lated coun­ter­in­tel­li­gence case about ev­ery 10 hours.”</p>
    <p>In one case, a sin­gle sci­en­tist, Tan Hongjin, pleaded guilty to steal­ing an es­ti­mated US$1 bil­lion (S$1.4 bil­lion) in trade se­crets from an Ok­la­homa-based en­ergy com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ply that hun­dreds if not thou­sands of times over, and what you have is ar­guably the largest sin­gle theft of for­eign prop­erty since Ger­many looted Europe in World War II.</p>
    <p>What­ever else one might say against the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, it isn’t ly­ing about China.</p>
    <p>But this brings us to the se­cond blunt fact. US power in East Asia is wan­ing. Mr Trump’s de­ci­sion to with­draw the coun­try from the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship – the sin­gle best hedge the US had against Chi­nese eco­nomic dom­i­nance of the region – may, in hind­sight, prove to be his sin­gle worst pol­icy mis­take.</p>
    <p>He has tried to shake down both South Korea and Ja­pan to pay more for bas­ing US forces in the two coun­tries – penny-ante pol­i­tics that only raise doubts about Amer­ica’s re­li­a­bil­ity as an ally.</p>
    <p>And then there’s the de­graded state of the US Navy, epit­o­mised by the fire on the Bon­homme Richard (it­self the lat­est in a string of cor­rup­tion, lead­er­ship, cost over­run and com­pe­tency scan­dals to be­devil the ser­vice). Mr Trump came to of­fice with grand plans to build a 355-ship navy, up from the cur­rent 300. The Pen­tagon all but ad­mits it has no hope of reach­ing that goal. Mean­while, the Chi­nese navy – which isn’t stretched around the world – has 335 ships, a 55 per cent in­crease in 15 years.</p>
    <p>If the US and China were to come to blows af­ter some in­ci­dent over some atoll in the South China Sea, are we con­fi­dent we’d pre­vail?</p>
    <p>When (fin­gers crossed) Mr Joe Bi­den is pres­i­dent, he needn’t ask his Cab­i­net mem­bers to de­liver philip­pics against Bei­jing. But, as the late US diplo­mat Ge­orge Ken­nan once wrote about an­other regime, Mr Bi­den must be pre­pared to con­front China with</p>
    <p>“un­al­ter­able counter-force at ev­ery point where they show signs of en­croach­ing upon the in­ter­ests of a peace­ful and sta­ble world”.</p>
