    <p>With Sin­ga­pore en­ter­ing phase three of its re­open­ing, mi­grant work­ers are grad­u­ally mov­ing out of tem­po­rary ac­com­mo­da­tion and re­turn­ing to their dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The last batch of work­ers who had been stay­ing in va­cant Hous­ing Board flats in Red­hill Close va­cated them yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>They had been there since April, as part of the Govern­ment’s strat­egy to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus in work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries, said Labour MP Melvin Yong on Face­book yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“As we move into phase three of the safe re­open­ing of our econ­omy, the need to house healthy mi­grant work­ers tem­po­rar­ily at Red­hill has also come to an end,” he added.</p>
    <p>The 21 HDB blocks in Red­hill Close had housed healthy mi­grant work­ers em­ployed in es­sen­tial ser­vices such as clean­ing and main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>The site in Bukit Merah was one of 36 un­used state prop­er­ties which were con­verted into tem­po­rary ac­com­mo­da­tion for mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Among the lo­ca­tions were 17 for­mer schools, in­clud­ing the for­mer In­nova Ju­nior Col­lege in Cham­pi­ons Way, the for­mer Seran­goon JC in Up­per Seran­goon Road, and the for­mer Tampines JC in Tampines Av­enue 9.</p>
    <p>Nine va­cant fac­to­ries, tent­age at NSRCC Kranji as well as nine other va­cant state prop­er­ties were con­verted for the same pur­pose.</p>
    <p>In his Face­book post, Mr Yong said he had spo­ken with the agen­cies which man­aged the Red­hill Close site.</p>
    <p>These agen­cies had faced “im­mense chal­lenges” while work­ing to pro­vide the mi­grant work­ers with data con­nec­tiv­ity, a min­i­mart, an in-house clinic and bar­ber ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“These were just a few of the ameni­ties they had to pro­vide al­most overnight,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Yong, who is also MP for Radin Mas, thanked his res­i­dents for wel­com­ing the mi­grant work­ers in the neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>He also ex­pressed his grat­i­tude to Red­hill grass­roots lead­ers and var­i­ous public sec­tor agen­cies in­volved in manag­ing the site.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, fa­cil­i­ties at Tan­jong Pa­gar Ter­mi­nal were par­tially taken down.</p>
    <p>The tent­age there was part of a mega-fa­cil­ity in­tended to house up to 15,000 pa­tients or for­eign work­ers with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The mega-fa­cil­ity, along­side other com­mu­nity iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties at Changi Ex­hi­bi­tion Cen­tre and Sin­ga­pore Expo, helped to free</p>
    <p>up hospi­tal fa­cil­i­ties for more se­ri­ous Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment said on Tues­day that since Au­gust, as dor­mi­to­ries were pro</p>
    <p>gres­sively cleared of Covid-19, mi­grant work­ers have grad­u­ally moved – ei­ther back to their orig­i­nal ac­com­mo­da­tion or to new Quick Build Dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some tent­age fa­cil­i­ties at Tan­jong Pa­gar Ter­mi­nal will re­main op­er­a­tional as the Govern­ment con­tin­ues to mon­i­tor the pan­demic situation, stand­ing</p>
    <p>down or ac­ti­vat­ing sites where nec­es­sary.</p>
