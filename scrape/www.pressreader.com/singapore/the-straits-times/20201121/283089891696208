    <p>Hong Kong di­rec­tor Stephen Chow (right) has been sued by his ex-girl­friend Alice Yu for fail­ing to pay her com­mis­sion of more than HK$70 mil­lion (S$12 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Chow, 58, and Ms Yu, who is be­lieved to be in her late 40s, split up in 2010 af­ter a 13-year re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the court fil­ings, Ms Yu, daugh­ter of prop­erty busi­ness­man Yu Ching Po, was also Chow’s busi­ness part­ner dur­ing their courtship.</p>
    <p>Draw­ing a monthly salary of HK$20,000, her des­ig­na­tion was “prop­erty ad­viser” and she helped to han­dle his movie copy­rights and prop­erty in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Chow, an ac­tor-turned-di­rec­tor, is fa­mous for di­rect­ing come­dies such as Kung Fu Hus­tle (2004), CJ7 (2008) and The Mer­maid (2016).</p>
    <p>Ms Yu, who tes­ti­fied in court on Thurs­day, said she and Chow reached a ver­bal agree­ment on the com­mis­sion on Christ­mas eve in 2002.</p>
    <p>Chow had then sug­gested giv­ing her a bi­cy­cle as a gift. But she pro­posed a 10 per cent com­mis­sion on their in­vest­ments, in­clud­ing three lux­ury units with five park­ing spa­ces and projects un­der Chow’s foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Yu was asked in court why she did not for­malise the agree­ment in writ­ing. She replied she did not do so as she trusted him at the time.</p>
    <p>She said she has not re­ceived a sin­gle cent from the more than HK$70 mil­lion in com­mis­sion due to her.</p>
    <p>Chow, who has yet to tes­tify in court, ad­mit­ted to mak­ing the prom­ise to Ms Yu in the court fil­ings.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he said it was made at the height of their re­la­tion­ship and thus not legally en­force­able like a busi­ness con­tract.</p>
    <p>He also ac­cused her of “cher­ryp­ick­ing” – men­tion­ing only prof­its, but not the HK$13 mil­lion losses made in other in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Chow, whose most re­cent movie was The New King Of Com­edy (2019), also said he had given Ms Yu HK$21.6 mil­lion. The sum, he said, was given out of love, with no other mo­tives.</p>
