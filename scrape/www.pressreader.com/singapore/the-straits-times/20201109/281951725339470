    <p>While the topic of men­tal health in Sin­ga­pore has in­creas­ingly be­come less of a taboo and more openly dis­cussed in re­cent years, more can be done to help peo­ple un­der­stand the men­tal health scene in Sin­ga­pore, and to help those who may be strug­gling.</p>
    <p>The youth have been the main ad­vo­cates for men­tal health aware­ness and are more will­ing to share their ex­pe­ri­ences, if it means help­ing some­one out, or help­ing them feel less alone.</p>
    <p>Men­tal health is­sues are unique to each in­di­vid­ual, and while there is no set “cure” or way to cope, lis­ten­ing and learn­ing about other in­di­vid­u­als’ ex­pe­ri­ences can help peo­ple be­gin to re­alise that maybe they are go­ing through some­thing sim­i­lar, and how to help them­selves.</p>
    <p>There­fore, I be­lieve that com­mu­nity lead­ers such as ed­u­ca­tors have a very large role to play in help­ing stu­dents un­der­stand men­tal health bet­ter.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve it is es­sen­tial for ed­u­ca­tors to be equipped with the skills to recog­nise and pro­vide the nec­es­sary help when their stu­dents face men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>I sug­gest that the topic of men­tal health be in­cluded in the sec­ondary school cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>We are taught how to take care of our­selves in health education classes, but these classes fo­cus more on phys­i­cal health and hy­giene. Eas­ing stu­dents into the topic of men­tal health start­ing from Sec­ondary 1 could be an op­tion to ex­plore.</p>
    <p>More­over, this could ex­tend to ed­u­cat­ing par­ents about men­tal health. This could po­ten­tially im­prove the ex­pec­ta­tion man­age­ment be­tween par­ents and their chil­dren when it comes to school and ex­celling in it.</p>
    <p>Hope­fully, par­ents can start to re­alise that their child might be go­ing through some­thing deeper than what they ini­tially per­ceive.</p>
    <p>It will take years be­fore we can erad­i­cate the stigma against peo­ple with men­tal health is­sues, as­sum­ing we ever suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>How­ever, I be­lieve that if Sin­ga­pore takes a step in ed­u­cat­ing our youth about men­tal health from a young age and con­tin­ues its ef­forts in ad­vo­cacy, it can be a much more open-minded and aware city. Aware­ness is the first step to mak­ing a change.</p>
