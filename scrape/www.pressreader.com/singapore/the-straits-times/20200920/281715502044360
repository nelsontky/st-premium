    <p>The man who was kept be­hind bars for two ex­tra days be­cause of a State Courts er­ror tried to dis­tract himself to avoid think­ing about the ex­tra hours he was spend­ing in jail.</p>
    <p>For those two nights, he tossed and turned in the jail cell he shared with three oth­ers, Mr Teo Seng Tiong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The fish farmer was kept awake on some nights dur­ing his sev­en­week im­pris­on­ment term by the inces­sant whirr of the ven­ti­la­tor fan and the noise his cell­mates made.</p>
    <p>But from Aug 22 to 23, it was the fact that he should have been a free man that weighed heav­ily on the 59-year-old’s mind.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the day, I could dis­tract my­self by talking to other peo­ple, but at night, when no one else was awake, I kept think­ing about it,” said Mr Teo in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>“It was like time wasn’t mov­ing.” Ear­lier this month, it was re­vealed that ow­ing to an ad­min­is­tra­tive er­ror by an of­fi­cer with the State Courts, Mr Teo ended up stay­ing in jail for two ex­tra days.</p>
    <p>He de­clined to say more, not­ing the con­fi­den­tial­ity agree­ment he had signed ear­lier this week for an undis­closed sum in com­pen­sa­tion from the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo, who is mar­ried with two adult chil­dren, was sen­tenced on Jan 14 to seven weeks’ jail and a fine of $500 for caus­ing hurt by a rash act, and for fail­ing to make a po­lice re­port within a day of an ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent hap­pened on Dec 22, 2018, in Pasir Ris.</p>
    <p>In a video that was widely cir­cu­lated, cy­clist Eric Che­ung Hoyu is seen hit­ting the left side mir­ror of Mr Teo’s lorry be­fore the ve­hi­cle</p>
    <p>KEPT THINK­ING ABOUT IT</p>
    <p>sud­denly swerves to the left to­wards Mr Che­ung.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish na­tional, who is 36 years old this year, can be seen fall­ing off his bi­cy­cle onto the grass verge at the side of the road.</p>
    <p>He was fined $2,800 for mis­chief and for not cy­cling in an or­derly and care­ful man­ner.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the jail term and fine, Mr Teo was dis­qual­i­fied from hold­ing or ob­tain­ing a driv­ing li­cence for two years.</p>
    <p>He was told that if he was un­able to pay the fine, he would have to serve an­other three days be­hind bars.</p>
    <p>Af­ter appealing un­suc­cess­fully to the High Court, Mr Teo paid the fine and be­gan serv­ing his jail term</p>
    <p>on July 20.</p>
    <p>While the High Court no­ti­fied the State Courts that the fine had been paid, the State Courts of­fi­cer in charge of the case failed to up­date the State Courts’ case man­age­ment sys­tem to re­flect this, said the State Courts on Sept 2.</p>
    <p>The er­ror was dis­cov­ered only when Mr Teo’s lawyer, Mr Tan Hee Joek, sent a re­ceipt of the pay­ment for the fine to the Sin­ga­pore Prison Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo was re­leased on Aug 24, two days af­ter he should have been, with a third of the three days’ jail in lieu of the fine re­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo has past of­fences that in­clude vol­un­tar­ily caus­ing hurt, care­less driv­ing, speed­ing and beat­ing a</p>
    <p>red light.</p>
    <p>But he insists his re­cent in­car­cer­a­tion taught him “pro­found” lessons and was a “bless­ing in dis­guise”.</p>
    <p>“(It gave me) the op­por­tu­nity to learn dis­ci­pline as well as how to con­trol (my) tem­per and let things go,” he said.</p>
    <p>Now he wants to put the mat­ter be­hind him, although he has been quizzed on the com­pen­sa­tion sum.</p>
    <p>“I’m ner­vous be­cause there is a lot of pres­sure and I have to al­ways be care­ful what I say (be­cause of the con­fi­den­tial­ity agree­ment).</p>
    <p>“Every­one, whether I know them or not, has been ask­ing me how much I got.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the day, I could dis­tract my­self by talking to other peo­ple, but at night, when no one else was awake, I kept think­ing about it... It was like time wasn’t mov­ing.</p>
    <p>MR TEO SENG TIONG, on the two ex­tra days he spent in jail due to an ad­min­is­tra­tive er­ror.</p>
