    <p>Pre­oc­cu­pied with chal­leng­ing the elec­tion re­sults at home, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump had been no­tably ab­sent at sev­eral key vir­tual meet­ings of in­ter­na­tional lead­ers last month, leav­ing a space that Chi­nese lead­ers were glad to fill.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump skipped the Asean and East Asia sum­mits, dur­ing which the 15-na­tion Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) trade deal – which in­cludes Asean and China – was signed.</p>
    <p>And while he at­tended the Group of 20 (G-20) Lead­ers’ Sum­mit late last month, he ap­peared dis­tracted on cam­era and left early to play golf, no­tably skip­ping a meet­ing on the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>China’s me­dia has been ea­ger to pick up on the con­trast be­tween Mr Trump and Chi­nese lead­ers, who have been mak­ing the rounds at th­ese vir­tual meet­ings, of­fer­ing ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines and urg­ing in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In an edi­to­rial last week, the na­tion­al­ist tabloid Global Times com­pared Mr Trump’s seem­ing dis­in­ter­est to the fail­ure by the United States to stem the spread of Covid-19 within its borders.</p>
    <p>“Trump was clearly not in­ter­ested in the G-20 sum­mit and its dis­cus­sions as his mind was still fully pre­oc­cu­pied with the 2020 elec­tions,” it wrote.</p>
    <p>“His pres­ence at the vir­tual Apec (Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion) lead­ers’ meet­ing... and the vir­tual G-20 sum­mit is be­lieved to be only a move to show he is still US pres­i­dent.”</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial Peo­ple’s Daily fol­lowed up with an ar­ti­cle point­ing out how Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping had been ac­tive at three re­cent vir­tual sum­mits – the Brics (Brazil, Rus­sia, In­dia, China and South Africa) sum­mit, Apec Eco­nomic</p>
    <p>Lead­ers’ Meet­ing and, most re­cently, the G-20 one.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi has sug­gested that China join the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP) and that na­tions should es­tab­lish a global health QR code for in­ter­na­tional travel, and has also promised coun­tries ac­cess to Chi­nese Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“In this post-pan­demic era, Xi Jin­ping has re­sponded to the ques­tion of our times, sug­gested China’s so­lu­tion and ex­plained China’s po­si­tions,” said the Peo­ple’s Daily.</p>
    <p>While high-level at­ten­dance at such in­ter­na­tional sum­mits is not un­usual for Bei­jing, ex­perts say it might be tak­ing a more ac­tive role on is­sues such as Covid-19 and trade in the vac­uum caused by Wash­ing­ton’s ab­sence.</p>
    <p>In the past four years, Mr Trump has taken an “Amer­ica First” ap­proach to for­eign pol­icy, and has</p>
    <p>crit­i­cised what he sees as un­fair trade deals and the un­equal bur­den that Amer­ica bears on the world stage.</p>
    <p>“Chi­nese ac­tivism in the con­text of Covid-19 in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion may be prompted by this think­ing of tak­ing ad­van­tage of US ab­sence and uni­lat­er­al­ism, be­cause it does give China some points in­ter­na­tion­ally,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Li Mingjiang from the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that this was also the case for China’s noted in­ter­est in join­ing the CPTPP.</p>
    <p>Dr Wang Huiyao, an ad­viser to China’s Cabi­net and founder of the Bei­jing think-tank Cen­tre for China and Glob­al­i­sa­tion, said that un­like the US, China has laid out con­crete pro­pos­als and ideas, rang­ing from its pledge at the United Na­tions in Septem­ber to go car­bon neu­tral by 2060, to the sign­ing of the RCEP trade pact.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are all con­crete steps, rec­om­men­da­tions and ac­tions, rather than gen­eral ideas,” he said.</p>
    <p>China’s re­marks against de­cou­pling, uni­lat­er­al­ism and pro­tec­tion­ism are also clearly directed at the US, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>But Wash­ing­ton’s re­treat from the in­ter­na­tional arena would likely come to an end when Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den takes of­fice in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has said he would take a more mul­ti­lat­er­al­ist ap­proach to the prob­lems con­fronting the US, in­clud­ing on China-re­lated is­sues.</p>
    <p>And ob­servers say Bei­jing has been pre­par­ing the ground for con­ducive in­ter­ac­tions with the new White House ad­min­is­tra­tion, send­ing sig­nals that it de­sires a re­set in bi­lat­eral ties.</p>
    <p>In his con­grat­u­la­tory mes­sage to Mr Bi­den last Wed­nes­day, Mr Xi said he hoped both sides could pur­sue healthy and sta­ble re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>And for­mer Chi­nese vice-for­eign min­is­ter Fu Ying wrote in a com­men­tary in The New York Times last week that both sides had to have can­did talks to cul­ti­vate the trust needed to tackle global chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“If the two sides en­gage in equal and can­did ne­go­ti­a­tions, they should be able to build a solid ba­sis for long-term re­la­tions that are ben­e­fi­cial to both,” she wrote in her com­men­tary that was also widely cir­cu­lated in China.</p>
    <p>Prof Li said that while it was clear to Bei­jing there would not be a sig­nif­i­cant shift in the com­pet­i­tive na­ture of Wash­ing­ton’s China pol­icy un­der Mr Bi­den, it wants to pre­vent fur­ther es­ca­la­tion of ex­ist­ing con­flicts. “There is a clear pic­ture that China does want to see at least some pos­i­tive changes in China-US re­la­tions, and prob­a­bly is cau­tiously op­ti­mistic about that hap­pen­ing,” he said.</p>
