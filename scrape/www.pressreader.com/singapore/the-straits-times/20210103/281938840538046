    <p>WASH­ING­TON The num­ber of peo­ple killed in large com­mer­cial air­plane crashes rose last year to 299 world­wide, even as the num­ber of crashes fell by more than 50 per cent, ac­cord­ing to a Dutch con­sult­ing firm.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion con­sult­ing firm To70 on Fri­day said there were 40 ac­ci­dents last year in­volv­ing large com­mer­cial pas­sen­ger planes, five of which were fa­tal, re­sult­ing in 299 fa­tal­i­ties. In 2019, there were 86 ac­ci­dents, eight of which were fa­tal, re­sult­ing in 257 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Large com­mer­cial air­planes had 0.27 fa­tal ac­ci­dent per mil­lion flights last year, To70 said, or one fa­tal crash for ev­ery 3.7 mil­lion flights – up from 0.18 fa­tal ac­ci­dent per mil­lion flights in 2019.</p>
    <p>The de­cline i n crashes came amid a plunge in the num­ber of flights be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fligh­tradar24 re­ported that the com­mer­cial flights it tracked world­wide last year fell 42 per cent to 24.4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>More than half of all deaths in the To70 re­view were the 176 peo­ple killed in Jan­uary last year when a Ukrainian plane was shot down in Ira­nian airspace.</p>
    <p>The se­cond dead­li­est in­ci­dent was the crash of a Pak­istan air­liner in May, which killed 98.</p>
    <p>Large pas­sen­ger air­planes cov­ered by the sta­tis­tics are used by nearly all trav­ellers on air­lines but ex­clude small com­muter air­planes in ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Over the past two decades, avi­a­tion deaths have been fall­ing dra­mat­i­cally. As re­cently as 2005, there were 1,015 deaths aboard com­mer­cial pas­sen­ger flights world­wide, the Avi­a­tion Safety Net­work (ASN) said.</p>
    <p>Over the past five years, there have been an av­er­age of 14 fa­tal ac­ci­dents for com­mer­cial pas­sen­ger and cargo planes, re­sult­ing in 345 deaths an­nu­ally, ASN said.</p>
    <p>In 2017, avi­a­tion had its safest year on record world­wide, with only two fa­tal ac­ci­dents in­volv­ing re­gional tur­bo­props that re­sulted in 13 deaths and no fa­tal crashes of pas­sen­ger jets.</p>
    <p>The United States has not had a fa­tal US pas­sen­ger air­line crash since Fe­bru­ary 2009. The coun­try had only one fa­tal­ity due to a US pas­sen­ger air­line ac­ci­dent in that pe­riod.</p>
