    <p>At Jalan Klapa in Kam­pong Glam, it is hard to miss the huge red and blue sig­nage of ex­pe­ri­en­tial mar­ket­ing agency amcasia! (The Au­di­ence Mo­ti­va­tion Com­pany Asia).</p>
    <p>Now, the com­pany is draw­ing even more eye­balls with one of Sin­ga­pore’s big­gest col­lab­o­ra­tive mu­rals – it cor­rals the cre­ative forces of 22 artists – on the side of its shop­house build­ing at 18 Jalan Klapa.</p>
    <p>And it is not just any mu­ral. The art­work – ti­tled I Want To Go There and un­veiled last Friday – comes with aug­mented-re­al­ity (AR) an­i­ma­tion that makes it come alive for pedes­tri­ans.</p>
    <p>It is the brain­child of Mr Bernard Oh, amcasia! founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive, who wanted to add some buzz to the Kam­pong Glam en­clave.</p>
    <p>The 54-year-old com­mis­sioned the artists – 11 tal­ents from amcasia! and 11 free­lancers – to trans­form the ex­te­rior wall of the shop­house, which his com­pany owns, into an in­ter­ac­tive mu­ral.</p>
    <p>The artists, who started work in early Oc­to­ber and took about a month to com­plete the mu­ral, come from dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines, rang­ing from art di­rec­tors to graphic il­lus­tra­tors.</p>
    <p>When passers-by scan a QR code next to the art­work on their phones, it morphs into a mov­ing mu­ral. In­stead of us­ing a stan­dard AR app, the agency cus­tomised the pro­gram us­ing sim­ple In­sta­gram fil­ters.</p>
    <p>“We want to al­low our au­di­ence to in­ter­act with the mu­ral be­yond the phys­i­cal space,” Mr Oh says.</p>
    <p>“While there were a cou­ple of cre­ative re­stric­tions, the fi­nal prod­uct is more ac­ces­si­ble for the pub­lic.”</p>
    <p>In 2013, he com­mis­sioned Pe­nang-based Lithua­nian street artist Ernest Zachare­vic to cre­ate a mu­ral for amcasia!’s 18th an­niver­sary. It de­picts chil­dren play­ing in su­per­mar­ket carts, with two stain­less-steel trol­leys at­tached to the art­work.</p>
    <p>For the in­ter­ac­tive mu­ral, the artists con­sulted the Malay Her­itage Foundation as they wanted to pay trib­ute to Kam­pong Glam.</p>
    <p>Through the AR an­i­ma­tion, iconic build­ings from the en­clave’s past – such as Kota Raja Malay School, Al-Ah­ma­diah Press and the for­mer Chong Cheng School – are jux­ta­posed against ex­ist­ing build­ings to re­in­force a sense of place and his­tory.</p>
    <p>The AR fea­ture will be up­dated pe­ri­od­i­cally with new events in the lo­cale.</p>
    <p>The amcasia! team has also put up a Santa Phone Booth out­side the build­ing for the fes­tive sea­son.</p>
    <p>And it has piqued the cu­rios­ity of mem­bers of the pub­lic. The staff found play­ful scrib­bling – such as “Tell them what you re­ally feel” and “Warn­ing! Feel­ings may arise” – on the in­stal­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Cre­ative man­ager Fiona Chong, 27, says: “Art has an ex­tra­or­di­nary way of bring­ing peo­ple to­gether, in­clud­ing those who have never met yet are able to en­rich one an­other’s lives through in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“This process has al­lowed us to see through other cre­atives’ eyes to seek com­mon ground, a sense of com­mu­nity and a need to cre­ate.”</p>
    <p>Her col­league, cre­ative ex­ec­u­tive Christina Yeo Khalid, 24, shares her sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>“This project started as a col­lab­o­ra­tion among strangers and evolved into a col­lab­o­ra­tion with friends,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one’s dif­fer­ent styles and per­son­al­i­ties shin­ing through the mu­ral is what makes it so special.”</p>
