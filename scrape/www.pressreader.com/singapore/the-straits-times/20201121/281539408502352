    <p>En­hanced tax re­bates from Jan­uary will give a boost to elec­tric ve­hi­cles, but for a big­ger shift, more changes need to take place, in­clud­ing the ramp-up of charg­ing in­fra­struc­ture and height­ened pub­lic aware­ness, says se­nior trans­port cor­re­spon­dent Christo­pher Tan.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment</p>
    <p>Agency an­nounced last week that there will be a $5,000 in­crease in re­bate and sur­charge for cleaner and filth­ier cars re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The clean­est range of cars will en­joy a tax re­bate of up to $25,000, while those which emit high lev­els of five key pol­lu­tants will face a sur­charge of up to $25,000.</p>
    <p>This re­vised Ve­hic­u­lar</p>
    <p>Emis­sions Scheme (VES) is valid till end-2022 be­fore the next re­vi­sion. What im­pact will it have on the take-up of elec­tric ve­hi­cles (EVs)?</p>
    <p>Log­i­cally, any in­crease in re­bates for cleaner cars and heftier penal­ties for more pol­lu­tive mod­els should shift con­sumer pref­er­ence – even if merely by a small de­gree.</p>
    <p>The big­gest ben­e­fi­cia­ries will be costlier elec­tric cars, which will see their prices off­set by an­other $25,000 – VES plus $20,000 from the EV Early Adop­tion In­cen­tive (EEAI) an­nounced ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>So, a car like the Tesla Model 3 could start from just un­der $200,000 when the Amer­i­can</p>
    <p>The MG ZS for Jan­uary de­liv­ery is $106,888, or around $12,000 lower than its pre­vi­ous price.</p>
    <p>brand re­turns to Sin­ga­pore next year. This would make the com­pact car less ex­pen­sive than a com­bus­tion-en­gined equiv­a­lent like the BMW 330i.</p>
    <p>Mass-mar­ket elec­tric mod­els with lower open mar­ket val­ues (OMV or roughly the cost of the car be­fore taxes) may not en­joy the full car­rot. This is be­cause re­bates are off­set against a car’s ad­di­tional reg­is­tra­tion fee (ARF), which is based on its OMV. Also, the</p>
    <p>min­i­mum ARF payable is $5,000.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the MG ZS for Jan­uary de­liv­ery is $106,888, or around $12,000 lower than its pre­vi­ous price. This is be­cause its OMV is about $32,000 – less than the full mea­sure of the two in­cen­tives, which to­tal $45,000. Still, in ab­so­lute terms, the MG ZS, at un­der $110,000, is ac­ces­si­ble to the ma­jor­ity of car buy­ers.</p>
    <p>An­other main­stream elec­tric model like the Nis­san Leaf will see</p>
    <p>its price fall from $150,000-plus now to $130,000-plus from Jan­uary. This will put it on a par with some­thing like the Volk­swa­gen Golf.</p>
    <p>Hence, the new VES, along with the EEAI, should in­crease elec­tric car sales, which num­ber fewer than 100 units this year (or 0.2 per cent of to­tal new car sales). It is, how­ever, un­likely to re­sult in wide­spread adop­tion.</p>
    <p>For a big­ger shift, more changes need to take place, in­clud­ing the ramp-up of charg­ing in­fra­struc­ture, avail­abil­ity of ve­hi­cle choices and height­ened pub­lic aware­ness.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment plans to roll out 28,000 pub­lic charg­ers by 2030 – up from about 1,600 now. But even at one charger a ve­hi­cle (an un­re­al­is­tic ra­tio), this plan will ac­com­mo­date only 28,000 EVs – a frac­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s ve­hi­cle pop­u­la­tion of nearly one mil­lion.</p>
    <p>If this con­ser­va­tive stance was not bad enough, a ma­jor ten­der to set up charg­ing points in Hous­ing Board es­tates – where more than 80 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans live – was post­poned re­cently.</p>
    <p>No won­der Tesla has de­cided to set up its own charg­ing network here.</p>
    <p>With bet­ter in­cen­tives start­ing in Jan­uary, car mak­ers will be en­cour­aged to of­fer more elec­tric mod­els here. Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volk­swa­gen and Volvo will be among those ex­pected to bring in bat­tery-pow­ered cars next year.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing brands with such cars are also ex­pected to add to their line-up. This will more than dou­ble the spread of elec­tric mod­els avail­able here, which could raise the mar­ket share of EVs by ten­fold to 2 per cent. Still small, but a start none­the­less.</p>
    <p>The last but equally cru­cial com­po­nent in Sin­ga­pore’s shift to­wards EVs – which are more ef­fi­cient and which pro­duce zero on-site emis­sions – is pub­lic aware­ness.</p>
    <p>It took 30 years for petrol­elec­tric hy­brid cars to gain a foothold here, partly be­cause peo­ple pre­fer to stick with the knowns when it comes to big-ticket items.</p>
    <p>EVs face an even big­ger hur­dle than hy­brids be­cause of their lim­ited range, the un­cer­tainty of bat­tery per­for­mance over the long term, the is­sue of bat­tery re­cy­cling and, in­creas­ingly, fire risks.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ers will have to ad­dress all these sat­is­fac­to­rily be­fore the pub­lic is con­fi­dent enough to even con­sider switch­ing.</p>
    <p>If not, no amount of mon­e­tary in­cen­tives will move the nee­dle de­ci­sively.</p>
