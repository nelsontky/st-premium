    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US avi­a­tion reg­u­la­tors have pro­posed a long list of fixes to Boe­ing’s grounded 737 Max in one of the most ex­ten­sive sets of re­quire­ments the agency has is­sued fol­low­ing an ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FAA) on Mon­day sought public com­ment on the changes it ex­pects of the plane linked to two fa­tal crashes. In ad­di­tion to fixes spe­cific to the sys­tem im­pli­cated in the ac­ci­dents, it would man­date broad com­puter changes to im­prove reli­a­bil­ity, add a warn­ing light that was in­op­er­a­tive in the two crashes and re­quire rerout­ing of elec­tri­cal wires that do not meet safety rules.</p>
    <p>The re­lease of the FAA pro­posal shows that, af­ter 16 months of the plane’s ground­ing and a se­ries of in­ves­tiga­tive re­ports and con­gres­sional hear­ings, avi­a­tion reg­u­la­tors are sat­is­fied that the fixes will al­low the plane to safely re­sume ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Flight tests of the re­designed sys­tems by FAA were com­pleted on July 2. The agency “has pre­lim­i­nar­ily de­ter­mined that Boe­ing’s pro­posed changes to the 737 Max de­sign, flight crew pro­ce­dures and main­te­nance pro­ce­dures ef­fec­tively mit­i­gate the air­plane-re­lated safety is­sues” re­vealed in the crashes, it said in a sum­mary re­port.</p>
    <p>The step is a wel­come mile­stone, but has to be ap­proached with cau­tion be­cause other crit­i­cal reg­u­la­tors in Europe and Canada have not acted, said Teal Group’s in­dus­try an­a­lyst Richard Aboulafia.</p>
    <p>“We’ll see what the com­men­tary pe­riod brings and we’ll see, most im­por­tantly, what the in­ter­na­tional part­ners do,” Mr Aboulafia said.</p>
    <p>While the Euro­pean Avi­a­tion Safety Agency has not yet been able to con­duct its own test flights of the Max, Boe­ing has demon­strated com­pli­ance un­der the Euro­pean stan­dards, the FAA said in its sum­mary of the re­view.</p>
    <p>The FAA’s pro­posal for fixes and a pre­lim­i­nary re­port on its find­ings from its own in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion pro­vide the most de­tailed ac­count­ing to date by the agency on the plane’s orig­i­nal short­falls and what went wrong in the two crashes.</p>
    <p>The ac­tions would cost US air­lines about US$1 mil­lion (S$1.4 mil­lion) for the 73 planes reg­is­tered in</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion “has pre­lim­i­nar­ily de­ter­mined that Boe­ing’s pro­posed changes to the 737 Max de­sign, flight crew pro­ce­dures and main­te­nance pro­ce­dures ef­fec­tively mit­i­gate the air­plane-re­lated safety is­sues” re­vealed in the crashes, it said in a sum­mary re­port...</p>
    <p>(The fixes) would cost US air­lines about US$1 mil­lion (S$1.4 mil­lion) for the 73 planes reg­is­tered in the coun­try, the FAA said.</p>
    <p>the coun­try, the FAA said. The agency did not es­ti­mate how much it would cost to make the re­quired changes on the sev­eral hun­dred jets reg­is­tered in other coun­tries and did not ac­count for Boe­ing’s costs.</p>
    <p>The man­u­fac­turer may cover some of the air­lines’ re­pair costs un­der war­ranty, the FAA said.</p>
    <p>The FAA also pro­posed re­quir­ing a test of the sen­sor – known as an an­gle of at­tack vane – that failed in the crashes and giv­ing each air­craft a test flight be­fore it is per­mit­ted to re­turn to ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The fixes out­lined by FAA ap­ply only to the Max mod­els, but the agency said Boe­ing is also con­sid­er­ing some changes to the 737 Next Gen­er­a­tion fam­ily, which pre­ceded the Max but were not sus­cep­ti­ble to the same fail­ure.</p>
    <p>There are 45 days set aside for public com­ment. That means the plane most likely can­not get the of­fi­cial go-ahead to re­turn to the skies un­til Oc­to­ber at the ear­li­est.</p>
    <p>With air­lines hav­ing to re­train pi­lots and per­form main­te­nance on the grounded fleet, it will take weeks or months longer be­fore the planes be­gin car­ry­ing pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The changes listed by the FAA track with those that have been dis­cussed for months, in­di­cat­ing no new prob­lems were found in the later stages of the agency’s re­view.</p>
    <p>A pair of crashes – each tied to the same flawed sys­tem that mal­func­tioned – killed 346 peo­ple less than five months apart. The first oc­curred on Oct 29, 2018, in the Java Sea shortly af­ter the plane’s take­off from Jakarta. The sec­ond was on March 10 last year in Ethiopia. The plane was grounded world­wide three days af­ter the sec­ond crash.</p>
    <p>The FAA said a fea­ture of the plane, known as the ma­noeu­vring char­ac­ter­is­tics aug­men­ta­tion sys­tem, had failed to meet safety re­quire­ments be­cause it could fail with a sin­gle mal­func­tion­ing sen­sor and its re­peated at­tempts to push down a plane’s nose could over­power pi­lots who did not re­act prop­erly. In both crashes, a mal­func­tion­ing sen­sor that er­ro­neously re­ported that the planes were pointed too high be­gan au­to­mat­i­cally and re­peat­edly push­ing down the noses of the jets.</p>
