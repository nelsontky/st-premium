    <p>Raw fish dishes were not sold by food stalls vis­ited by pa­tients who re­cently con­tracted bac­te­rial in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The Group B Strep­to­coc­cus (GBS) strain that in­fected about 160 peo­ple who ate raw fresh­wa­ter fish in 2015 was also not de­tected in rou­tine sam­pling and test­ing of fish sam­ples be­tween May last year and this month.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA), in a joint statement with the Min­istry of Health (MOH), yes­ter­day gave an up­date af­ter a probe.</p>
    <p>It had in­spected the food stalls vis­ited by the re­cent pa­tients as part of field in­ves­ti­ga­tions on their food his­tory.</p>
    <p>The statement fol­lowed a cir­cu­lar last Friday from MOH to doc­tors that said pub­lic hos­pi­tals re­ported 50 cases of in­va­sive GBS last month – twice the av­er­age monthly fig­ure of 25 from ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Lab­o­ra­tory tests showed that 18 of these 50 cases were due to GBS Type III ST283, the same strain that in­fected about 160 of 360 peo­ple in the 2015 out­break.</p>
    <p>A ban on the use of fresh­wa­ter fish in ready-to-eat raw fish dishes has been in place since De­cem­ber 2015. Salt­wa­ter fish can still be used in such dishes.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said the majority of the cases with GBS Type III ST283 were aged 65 and above, and most of them have since been dis­charged and re­cov­ered from the in­fec­tion. One died due to an un­re­lated cause.</p>
    <p>The min­istry re­minded food stalls sell­ing ready-to-eat raw salt­wa­ter fish dishes to en­sure good hy­giene prac­tices and proper han­dling of the fish.</p>
    <p>It also alerted doc­tors to re­main vig­i­lant and re­port sus­pected in­va­sive GBS cases.</p>
    <p>Vul­ner­a­ble groups of peo­ple should avoid con­sum­ing raw food as a pre­cau­tion, said MOH.</p>
    <p>These in­clude young chil­dren, preg­nant women, el­derly per­sons or peo­ple with chronic ill­ness such as di­a­betes, who may be more sus­cep­ti­ble to get­ting in­fected.</p>
    <p>It also ad­vised peo­ple to thor­oughly cook their food, wash their hands and uten­sils be­fore pre­par­ing and eat­ing it, and to use sep­a­rate equip­ment for pre­par­ing cooked and raw food.</p>
