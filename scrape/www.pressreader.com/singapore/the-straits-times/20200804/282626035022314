    <p>As we cau­tiously emerged into the post cir­cuit-breaker phase of life with Covid-19, my hus­band rushed to the gym and daugh­ters planned out­ings with four of their clos­est friends. I went for a long-pend­ing hair­cut and a much-needed mas­sage, hop­ing th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties would help me look and feel bet­ter. But some­thing was amiss. Life still didn’t feel nor­mal. Un­til the pub­lic li­braries re­opened on July 1.</p>
    <p>I didn’t have ac­cess to li­braries while grow­ing up in Mum­bai. My school had a sparse, highly cu­rated col­lec­tion in­ca­pable of sup­ply­ing the num­ber or va­ri­ety of books to cater to my vo­ra­cious ap­petite. But read­ing ma­te­ri­als were al­ways within reach: daily news­pa­pers, monthly edi­tions of Reader’s</p>
    <p>Digest and a ran­dom se­lec­tion of mag­a­zines, some new, some dated, some left be­hind by visi­tors. I bartered books with friends. Oc­ca­sion­ally I spent my pocket money on yel­low, tat­tered copies of books sold in heaps on foot­paths.</p>
    <p>But the largest source of books spilled out of cheap, hole-in-the-wall shops with vast col­lec­tions of comics and paperbacks, poky stores that dou­bled as li­braries. For a min­i­mal de­posit, I could rent and re­turn award-win­ning books and skim through racy nov­els. Books and ru­pees hastily ex­changed across nar­row coun­ters in cramped spa­ces with zero am­bi­ence served as pre­ludes to the thrilling read­ing en­coun­ters that fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>The store owner did not know the dif­fer­ence be­tween high-brow lit­er­a­ture and pulp fic­tion. Nei­ther did I. This lack of so­phis­ti­ca­tion en­abled me to sam­ple a wide range of books with equal in­ter­est, in­trigued by a good story re­gard­less of lit­er­ary merit or au­thor cre­den­tials.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t un­til I lived in the United States that I be­gan to ap­pre­ci­ate the bless­ings of well-stocked li­braries. What I con­sid­ered to be the best perk of liv­ing in a de­vel­oped coun­try was an or­di­nary en­ti­tle­ment that was as­sumed as their right by tax­pay­ers. Read­ing for leisure be­came a top pri­or­ity in the years that I lived there.</p>
    <p>When I moved to Sin­ga­pore, I was de­lighted to once again be sur­rounded by a net­work of li­braries. Although the smaller branches of the Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) were closer to home, I pre­ferred Jurong Re­gional Li­brary. With four floors of pre­cisely la­belled, ac­cu­rately cat­a­logued books ar­ranged in neat rows, this mod­ern build­ing was book heaven. Desks lined the length of tall glass win­dows. Com­fort­able so­fas in the en­closed “quiet read­ing area” pro­vided a safe space to browse or drowse. And for a quick break or bite, a cafe was con­ve­niently lo­cated at the en­trance.</p>
    <p>The well-stocked book racks were too tempt­ing for my fee­ble will. See­ing my huge haul, my hus­band cheek­ily en­quired if I was pre­par­ing for war.</p>
    <p>Who knew then that a day would soon ar­rive when an in­vis­i­ble virus would make the world hud­dle in­doors for months?</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to the an­nounce­ment of the cir­cuit breaker, peo­ple flocked to su­per­mar­kets to stock up on food sta­ples. I raced to the li­brary.</p>
    <p>When I ran out of phys­i­cal books af­ter the first month. I stud­ied the book­shelves in my own home, filled with un­read books pur­chased on a rec­om­men­da­tion or a whim, gifts from friends and lega­cies from fam­ily mem­bers. The books them­selves, like the words in them, were gems hid­ing in plain sight, a trea­sure I may not have dis­cov­ered had it not been for the con­straints posed by this en­forced seclu­sion. Later, I moved to e-books and audiobooks.</p>
    <p>The words of au­thors from dif­fer­ent coun­tries brought me new sto­ries and ideas de­spite be­ing ma­rooned, re­mind­ing me of the words of Pulitzer prize-win­ning au­thor Anna Quindlen who said “Books are the plane, and the train, and the road. They are the des­ti­na­tion, and the jour­ney. ”</p>
    <p>But a li­brary is more than a well-or­gan­ised ware­house for books. It is also a com­mu­nal space for gath­er­ing, for learn­ing. I missed the monthly writ­ing work­shops at Toa Payoh li­brary and meet-the-au­thor ses­sions at the Cen­tral li­brary. Fi­nally the li­braries re­opened.</p>
    <p>I set out on a week­day af­ter­noon with my large pile of “to be re­turned” books to Jurong Re­gional Li­brary. There were new pro­ce­dures for en­try. Safe check-in, of course, but also a coloured sticker with in­struc­tions to exit in 30 minutes. De­serted desks and taped up so­fas lined the tall glass win­dows. No young­sters with head­phones star­ing at screens. No se­niors scan­ning news­pa­pers. No queue at the check­out kiosk. The en­tire floor was eerily silent. A li­brary is meant to be quiet, but this si­lence was dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>With­out the re­as­sur­ing back­ground buzz, it was no longer a so­cial space. I felt a twinge of sad­ness. Not just for the oc­ca­sional big ticket ac­tiv­i­ties that I had can­celled or de­ferred, but for the small things that I had al­ways taken for granted. When was the last time I had seen the face of a stranger with­out a mask, or shared a cup of cof­fee with of­fice col­leagues?</p>
    <p>Life and change are syn­ony­mous. Some­times we choose change and other times, it is thrust upon us. I thought back to all the ways in which my book con­sump­tion habits had changed over the years. From cheap paperbacks in road­side stalls to eclec­tic col­lec­tions in el­e­gant li­braries, from phys­i­cal books to e-books and audiobooks, I had adapted to change pretty well.</p>
    <p>For the fore­see­able fu­ture, I was stuck on a tiny is­land. But I had ac­cess to the li­brary. I scanned my books with the NLB phone app and stepped out. In my hand was a heavy bag and be­hind my mask, a big smile.</p>
