    <p>PA­PER (Al­ba­nia) On a small farm south of Ti­rana, don­keys happily munch on hay while cus­tomers flock to scoop up bot­tles of their milk – a niche prod­uct win­ning fans who be­lieve in its health ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Touted as rich in vi­ta­mins and as a boost for the im­mune sys­tem, the high-priced milk has been fly­ing off the shelves dur­ing the coron­avirus pan­demic – a time when many in Al­ba­nia are look­ing for an ex­tra health kick.</p>
    <p>The de­mand for don­key milk is ris­ing sharply along­side virus in­fec­tions, says Mr El­ton Kikia, 37, man­ager of the small farm in the vil­lage of Pa­per, where around a dozen of the small, knob­bly-kneed an­i­mals romp around a green pas­ture.</p>
    <p>The high de­mand is good news for the don­keys, whose com­fort­able lifestyle on the farm is a wel­come respite from their tra­di­tional roles as beasts of bur­den.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cally en­listed to carry heavy loads and pull carts through Al­ba­nia’s moun­tain­ous ter­rain, don­keys are fre­quently sub­ject to mis­treat­ment in the form of beat­ings, over­work or sad­dle sores.</p>
    <p>“It is a very del­i­cate an­i­mal, which needs ten­der­ness and love to pro­duce its milk,” says Mr Kikia.</p>
    <p>Two years ago, he left his job as a jour­nal­ist to take over the fam­ily farm, which is only one of two in Al­ba­nia to raise don­keys for their milk.</p>
    <p>At €50 (S$81) a litre, the price of don­key milk is ex­or­bi­tant in a coun­try where the av­er­age wage barely reaches €400 a month. But fears around Covid-19 have set off a flurry of in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>While no one is brand­ing the milk as a cure for the virus, afi­ciona­dos are con­vinced its nu­tri­tional pro­file – which is close to hu­man milk – helps strengthen the body’s nat­u­ral de­fences.</p>
    <p>Ms Klea Ymeri, a stu­dent in agro-en­vi­ron­men­tal engi­neer­ing, re­cently trav­elled to Pa­per to buy two 250ml bot­tles to help her par­ents re­cover from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“On top of the medicines they are tak­ing, don­key’s milk could be a good nat­u­ral rem­edy for the res­pi­ra­tory sys­tem,” she says.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily also uses some of the milk to make soaps, masks and other beauty prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The farm now has four preg­nant don­keys and four milk-pro­duc­ing mothers, each with a calf.</p>
    <p>With a max­i­mum pro­duc­tion of three litres a day, “we can’t meet the de­mand”, says Mr Kikia, who plans to ex­pand his herd to 100 don­keys.</p>
    <p>But that is no easy task in Al­ba­nia, where the don­key pop­u­la­tion is on the de­cline.</p>
    <p>Waves of em­i­gra­tion from vil­lages to cities, plus the use of ma­chines in agri­cul­ture, has shrunk the num­ber of don­keys and breed­ers across the Balkan state.</p>
    <p>Milk pro­duc­tion is thus a way of “pro­tect­ing” the species, say the farm­ers, whose an­i­mals still bear the scars of their dif­fi­cult past lives. “They are cared for and re­ha­bil­i­tated, in­clud­ing psy­cho­log­i­cally,” says Mr Riza Kikia, 71, El­ton’s father.</p>
    <p>He adds that Geni, for ex­am­ple, is a white fe­male don­key who ar­rived with a wounded ear and a scarstreak­ed back. “She was weak, sad, she didn’t want to stay with the oth­ers. Now she plays, she eats well and she makes good milk.”</p>
    <p>The don­keys also draw lo­cal chil­dren from the vil­lage, who come to ride, feed and pet the an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>“This bond be­tween the don­keys and the chil­dren is a (form of) ther­apy in it­self,” says Mr Kikia. “It is a psy­cho­log­i­cal rem­edy that has mag­i­cal ef­fects, both on the be­hav­iour of the chil­dren and on that of the an­i­mals.”</p>
