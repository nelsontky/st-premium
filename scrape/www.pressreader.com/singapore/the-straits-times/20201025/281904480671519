    <p>NEW DELHI • US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo is fly­ing to In­dia this week to strengthen strate­gic ties with a na­tion that is locked in a mil­i­tary stand-off with China, in Wash­ing­ton’s lat­est ef­fort to bol­ster al­lies against Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>As part of an in­ten­si­fy­ing push­back against China’s grow­ing eco­nomic and mil­i­tary power in the re­gion, Mr Pom­peo will also travel to Sri Lanka and the Mal­dives, two In­dian Ocean coun­tries strug­gling with a moun­tain of Chi­nese debt in­curred to fi­nance big in­fra­struc­ture projects. He will con­clude his trip in In­done­sia, which is also locked in ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes with China in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>“We’re look­ing for­ward to strength­en­ing crit­i­cal re­la­tion­ships with our friends and part­ners, em­pha­sis­ing our deep com­mit­ment to the Indo-Pa­cific and ad­vanc­ing our vi­sion for long-term part­ner­ship and pros­per­ity in the re­gion,” said Mr Dean Thomp­son, prin­ci­pal deputy as­sis­tant sec­re­tary at the State Depart­ment’s Bureau of</p>
    <p>South and Cen­tral Asian Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton has been ramp­ing up diplo­matic pres­sure on Bei­jing ahead of the Nov 3 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo this month led the Quad meet­ing of for­eign min­is­ters from In­dia, Ja­pan and Aus­tralia, a group­ing that the United States en­vi­sions as a bul­wark against China’s grow­ing as­sertive­ness in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>“This is more about real for­eign pol­icy than do­mes­tic pol­i­tics,” said Mr Gre­gory Pol­ing, mar­itime se­cu­rity ex­pert at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>“Yes, Pom­peo’s anti-China rhetoric is largely about the elec­tion, but State’s broader push to strengthen the Quad, tighten re­la­tions with Tai­wan, heighten at­ten­tion on the South China Sea and more, are be­ing driven as much by the pol­icy pro­fes­sion­als as the politi­cians.”</p>
    <p>Chi­nese for­eign min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian on Fri­day said the US was bul­ly­ing coun­tries into pick­ing sides over their links to China, but that such ef­forts would not suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Mr Pom­peo’s trip, In­dia is ex­pected to sign an agree­ment that will give it ac­cess to sen­si­tive US satel­lite data to help im­prove tar­get­ing of mis­siles and drones, In­dian of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>And in what will be the first visit by the US’ top diplo­mat to Sri Lanka in more than a decade, Mr Pom­peo will ad­vise lead­ers in Colombo to scale back de­pen­dence on China, which has in­vested bil­lions of dol­lars build­ing ports and high­ways but left the is­land na­tion in debt, Mr Thomp­son said.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s fi­nal stop, in In­done­sia, comes amid an es­ca­lat­ing US-China ri­valry that is be­ing vig­or­ously con­tested in South-east Asia, es­pe­cially in the South China Sea, which China claims as al­most en­tirely its own ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>The claim is op­posed by many states in the re­gion, in­clud­ing In­done­sia.</p>
