    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Your big new ideas are tak­ing root, so ex­pect some ac­tion soon. You may find that at least one per­son is will­ing to go along with your schemes, no mat­ter how nutty they seem at first.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You have to avoid the urge to be too right­eous with your friends or col­leagues – they are not in the mood and you may end up los­ing ground. It is a good time to try to find con­sen­sus.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>It is up to you to make things hap­pen. Your en­ergy needs fo­cus, so if you do not have a plan, at­tach your­self to some­thing that sounds good and get go­ing.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your pub­lic and pri­vate lives are in con­flict, so see if you can fo­cus on one ex­clu­sively or try to do some­thing new. It may be a good time to work from home, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your vi­tal en­ergy is plugged into the world’s vibe and mak­ing life more in­ter­est­ing. See if you can get your peo­ple to rally around your cause – it should not be all that hard.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You some­times do not let your­self back out of obli­ga­tions even when they are not work­ing out for you, which is more ad­mirable than you would like to ad­mit. This is one of those times.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are re­spond­ing well to good news and you are not the only one. Some­one may build on this foun­da­tion to make some­thing sweeter ap­pear, so keep your eyes open.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>This is not a good day to play games of any kind. You may have fun, but luck is not on your side. Try to back oth­ers as they play or find pur­suits that leave ab­so­lutely noth­ing to chance.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Some­times, you know what you want. Your great en­ergy helps you to go for it and you should be able to get your way with­out any ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You can­not be­lieve how quickly you can plough through your work to­day – it is like you are a ma­chine. Your en­ergy is sub­dued, but it is eas­ier for you to fo­cus and get into the flow.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You are in the midst of a great so­cial event, though it may not be as ob­vi­ous or co­he­sive as a party or po­lit­i­cal move­ment. Take time to ac­knowl­edge the good work you and your peo­ple do.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You are not likely to have the best day at work or on a job hunt, but that does not mean you can­not have a good time else­where. It does mean that you have to re­dou­ble your ef­forts in a day or two.</p>
