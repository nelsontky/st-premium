    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Amer­i­can ac­tress and #Me­Too ac­tivist Rose McGowan has ac­cused di­rec­tor Alexan­der Payne of sex­u­ally groom­ing her, i n an ex­plo­sive tweet on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>McGowan, who turns 47 next month, wrote of the di­rec­tor of films such as Elec­tion (1999) and About Sch­midt (2002): “You sat me down and played a soft-core porn movie you di­rected for Show­time un­der a dif­fer­ent name... You left me on a street cor­ner after­wards. I was 15.”</p>
    <p>She fol­lowed it up with an­other tweet with a photo of her­self: “I just want an ac­knowl­edge­ment and an apol­ogy. I do not want to de­stroy. This was me at 15.”</p>
    <p>McGowan, one of the first to come for­ward with al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual as­sault against disgraced mogul Harvey We­in­stein in Oc­to­ber 2017, wrote a longer post on In­sta­gram on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“Last night, I dropped a bomb of truth. For years I had thought a man I had sex­ual re­la­tions with was a sex­ual ex­pe­ri­ence I had. I now know I was groomed. I au­di­tioned for him at 15. After my ex­pe­ri­ence with him, I quit act­ing en­tirely un­til I was ‘dis­cov­ered’ at 21,” wrote the ac­tress, who is best known for her role as Paige Matthews in su­per­nat­u­ral tele­vi­sion se­ries Charmed (1998 to 2006).</p>
    <p>“I even tweeted a con­grat­u­la­tions on his Os­car win in 2012. That’s how deep in the cult of Hol­ly­wood I was. It wasn’t un­til three weeks after the We­in­stein story broke that I re-eval­u­ated the sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Payne, 59, has so far not re­sponded to the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>It is not known how he and</p>
    <p>McGowan had met.</p>
    <p>At the 2012 Acad­emy Awards, he was nom­i­nated for three awards, in­clud­ing Best Pic­ture and Best Di­rec­tor, for The De­scen­dants (2011), which starred Ge­orge Clooney and Shai­lene Wood­ley.</p>
    <p>Payne even­tu­ally won Best Adapted Screen­play for the movie. He has also re­ceived Best Di­rec­tor Os­car nom­i­na­tions for Side­ways (2004) and Ne­braska (2013).</p>
