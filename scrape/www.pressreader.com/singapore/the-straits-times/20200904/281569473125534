    <p>In­dia has re­ported an­other record daily jump of 83,883 Covid-19 in­fec­tions on Wed­nes­day – the same day the govern­ment started pre­par­ing to open metro ser­vices as part of eas­ing lock­down re­stric­tions. It is now the third-most af­fected coun­try with 3.85 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>In­dia recorded a new high of 83,883 coro­n­avirus cases over 24 hours on Wed­nes­day – the same day the govern­ment started pre­par­ing to open metro ser­vices as part of eas­ing lock­down re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>This rep­re­sented the high­est sin­gle-day in­crease since the coro­n­avirus was first de­tected in the coun­try in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>In­dia is the world’s sec­ond most pop­u­lous coun­try with 1.35 bil­lion peo­ple and the third most af­fected with 3.85 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts noted a wor­ry­ing up­ward trend even though test­ing had also in­creased.</p>
    <p>Test­ing in­creased from 10 a day on Jan 30 to an av­er­age of 1.1 mil­lion, the Health Min­istry said, adding that 1.17 mil­lion were tested on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“It (the num­bers) means two things. One is that the virus is in­deed spread­ing to more places and af­fect­ing more peo­ple,” said Pro­fes­sor K. Sri­nath Reddy, pres­i­dent of the Pub­lic Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia and a mem­ber of the In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search’s Covid-19 task force.</p>
    <p>“It also means in­creased test­ing is de­tect­ing peo­ple with the virus. The com­bi­na­tion of the two fac­tors has led to the in­crease in num­bers.”</p>
    <p>He noted that the large in­crease was com­ing from cities other than the metro cities with the ex­cep­tion of Delhi, smaller towns and vil­lages.</p>
    <p>“Delhi is like a yo-yo. It showed some ini­tial ben­e­fits be­tween June and July. But in Au­gust it has slipped up and the au­thor­i­ties are be­gin­ning to scram­ble again,” said Prof Reddy.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal Delhi had seen a de­cline in cases over the past month, lead­ing the govern­ment to say the city had turned a cor­ner.</p>
    <p>But cases shot up to 2,000 over the week­end af­ter daily in­creases</p>
    <p>of around 1,000 for 50 days.</p>
    <p>Delhi recorded 2,509 new cases on Wed­nes­day, but the city govern­ment has ruled out a sec­ond wave.</p>
    <p>“We could have called it a sec­ond wave if there were no pos­i­tive cases for one or two months and then cases would have started com­ing again. The virus is still there in Delhi,” Delhi Health Min­is­ter Satyen­dar Jain told re­porters.</p>
    <p>In­dia im­ple­mented a complete lock­down on March 25, which halted all eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity. At its strictest level in March and April, peo­ple were al­lowed to leave their homes only to buy es­sen­tial items.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions have eased since in phases, with the lat­est move to re­sume metro ser­vices in what is be­ing called “Un­lock 4”. Ed­u­ca­tion in</p>
    <p>sti­tutes still re­main closed.</p>
    <p>The eas­ing of re­stric­tions comes as wor­ries have grown about the health of the econ­omy, ad­versely hit by the strin­gent lock­down in the early days. Growth in the three months to June 30 con­tracted by 23.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>Metro ser­vices are due to re­sume in a grad­u­ated man­ner from Mon­day af­ter a five-month hia­tus.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment said peo­ple with a fever will not be al­lowed to travel, masks are manda­tory at all times and trains will not stop at stations where peo­ple were not prac­tis­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Min­is­ter for Hous­ing and Ur­ban Af­fairs Hardeep Singh Puri warned that ac­tion would be taken against of­fend­ers, in­clud­ing possi</p>
    <p>bly nam­ing and sham­ing.</p>
    <p>“If an in­di­vid­ual’s mis­be­haviour re­sults in jeop­ar­dis­ing a pub­lic util­ity which is so vi­tal in the life of a city or a coun­try, ob­vi­ously there is lit­tle tol­er­ance for such be­hav­iour,” said Mr Puri on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>There is wide­spread con­sen­sus that a new lock­down may not be the so­lu­tion, given the eco­nomic costs.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts said that with num­bers go­ing up, the loos­en­ing of re­stric­tions would be a chal­lenge in the fight against Covid-19. Con­tact trac­ing and test­ing are seen to be key, apart from en­forc­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing and mask use, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>“Now, Un­lock 4 is the real test. It’s at a point of time when a whole lot of fa­tigue has set in with pre­ven­tive prac­tices (like so­cial dis­tanc­ing) at</p>
    <p>in­di­vid­ual or group level,” said Dr Rajib Das­gupta, chair­man of the Centre of So­cial Medicine and Com­mu­nity Health, Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>He said that it seemed in the be­gin­ning of last month that In­dia was go­ing to sta­bilise, but, in­stead, the num­bers ap­peared to be rising with the trend of growth in ru­ral ar­eas.</p>
    <p>“Sev­eral states which are pre­dom­i­nantly ru­ral like Jhark­hand, Ch­hat­tis­garh, As­sam, Hi­machal Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh are on the rise.</p>
    <p>“Some of these are also states with low test­ing. Plus, even ear­lier hot spots like Delhi are also wit­ness­ing an­other surge. We are sort of at the cross­roads.”</p>
    <p>Delhi is like a yo-yo. It showed some ini­tial ben­e­fits be­tween June and July. But in Au­gust it has slipped up and the au­thor­i­ties are be­gin­ning to scram­ble again.</p>
