    <p>Not every dol­lar is equal when it comes to show­ing your par­ents that you love them.</p>
    <p>You can give them cash every month or you can use some of the money to let them en­joy the ben­e­fits of Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) schemes for se­niors.</p>
    <p>If your mother has been the main care­giver of the fam­ily for many years, chances are, she will have lit­tle or no sav­ings in her CPF ac­count, so she will miss out on the ben­e­fits of re­ceiv­ing a reg­u­lar monthly pay­out.</p>
    <p>But it is not too late to en­rol your el­derly par­ents in the CPF Life scheme, so long as they are be­low 80. This will en­able them to re­ceive a monthly pay­out for life, with the amount de­pend­ing on how much you con­trib­ute.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, if your mother is 72 now, a $30,000 con­tri­bu­tion to her re­tire­ment ac­count will en­able her to re­ceive a monthly pay­ment of $200 for life, while a con­tri­bu­tion of $60,000 will give her $400.</p>
    <p>You might ask: Would it not make more sense to give your mother the whole $60,000 so that she can de­cide how to spend it?</p>
    <p>Of course, you can do that. But the dif­fer­ence is a lump sum cash amount is fi­nite and even if she spends only $400 a month, the money will be gone by the time she hits 84. But if she is on CPF Life, she will con­tinue to re­ceive this amount for as long as she lives.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine that she main­tains a healthy life­style and con­tin­ues to take part in sil­ver gen­er­a­tion events at 90 – by then, she would have col­lected $86,400 from CPF Life. That is about 44 per cent more than the orig­i­nal sum given to her. No other in­vest­ment can pro­vide this kind of re­turn that is risk-free and guar­an­teed by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>For many peo­ple, $60,000 is not some­thing read­ily avail­able in their bank ac­counts, so mak­ing a big lump sum con­tri­bu­tion may not be a vi­able op­tion.</p>
    <p>This is where the an­nual top-ups of the CPF re­tire­ment fund comes in: You can hold a fam­ily con­fer­ence and get all your sib­lings to chip in to give your par­ents a good re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>If pos­si­ble, every child can aim to top up at least $7,000 for their par­ents’ CPF.</p>
    <p>Why $7,000? As an in­cen­tive, the Gov­ern­ment will al­low you to claim this sum for tax re­lief if you do a top-up for your kin, such as a spouse or par­ents.</p>
    <p>So if you have two other sib­lings, in just three years, all of you would have given your mother a good re­tire­ment gift and she will con­tinue to en­joy this for as long as she lives.</p>
    <p>GET CARESHIELD LIFE FOR YOUR PAR­ENTS</p>
    <p>This is an­other good scheme you can take up to help your par­ents.</p>
    <p>Come next year, those aged 41 and older can choose to sign up for this scheme if they are not se­verely dis­abled and able to per­form at least three of the ba­sic es­sen­tial tasks of life.</p>
    <p>Th­ese tasks are the abil­ity to take a bath or shower, put on and take off clothes, eat, use the toi­let, walk or move around, and trans­fer to a chair, bed or wheel­chair.</p>
    <p>This new scheme, which re­places ElderShiel­d, also of­fers life­long pay­outs once a claim has been ap­proved.</p>
    <p>If your par­ents are al­ready en­rolled in ElderShiel­d, you can help them con­vert it to CareShield Life once the Gov­ern­ment re­leases more de­tails on how to do so late next year.</p>
    <p>If they are not on any scheme, you should con­sider sign­ing up for them be­cause get­ting frail and need­ing a care­giver is some­thing that is go­ing to hap­pen to most Sin­ga­pore­ans as they live longer.</p>
    <p>Just like CPF Life, which aims to pro­vide se­niors with money every month to spend dur­ing their re­tire­ment, CareShield Life aims to pro­vide those who re­quire more help an ad­di­tional $600 or more every month so that their fam­i­lies can help pay for the ser­vices of a care­giver, if needed.</p>
    <p>As gen­er­ous sub­si­dies are likely to be given to both Pioneer and Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion se­niors, the pre­mium for even those who sign up for the first time is es­ti­mated to be less than $1,500 an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>And you need to pay this for only 10 years. But if a suc­cess­ful claim is made dur­ing this pe­riod, there is no need to pay any more.</p>
    <p>En­sur­ing your par­ents are well pro­vided for by th­ese gov­ern­ment schemes ben­e­fits you too be­cause the reg­u­lar pay­outs will help ease your fam­ily’s cash flow, which can then be used to pay for other ex­penses.</p>
    <p>To be fair, there are many se­niors who are well pre­pared for their own re­tire­ment and do not need their chil­dren to sup­port them.</p>
    <p>Th­ese are se­niors who not only have suf­fi­cient sav­ings in the form of fixed de­posits, but also know how to max­imise their re­turns in their CPF. A num­ber of se­niors have writ­ten in to In­vest to ask how they can put more money back into CPF to en­joy the high in­ter­est rate, even though they are in their late 60s and 70s.</p>
    <p>A third have also opted for CPF Life’s Ba­sic pay­out plan, so they choose to re­ceive less money when they are alive so that more can be given to their chil­dren upon death. Frankly, such de­voted par­ents need not do this – for all their great sac­ri­fices as the Pioneer Gen­er­a­tion, they de­serve to have a more com­fort­able re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, the best gift they can give their chil­dren is not money but the wis­dom to lead a good and hon­est life.</p>
