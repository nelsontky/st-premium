    <p>GROWTH AMID THE GLOOM</p>
    <p>Six bud­ding en­ter­prises were recog­nised for their busi­ness in­no­va­tion, re­silience and ex­cel­lence at the Emerg­ing En­ter­prise Award 2020 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Vend­ing ma­chine man­u­fac­turer and oper­a­tor Fruits Vend­ing, biotech start-up Im­munoS­cape and data lo­gis­tics firm SkyLab Net­works were hon­oured for show­ing an en­ter­pris­ing mind­set and dis­play­ing po­ten­tial for sig­nif­i­cant and sus­tain­able growth.</p>
    <p>Ro­bot de­vel­oper We­ston Ro­bot re­ceived the best in­no­va­tion award while so­cial en­ter­prise TreeDots En­ter­prise, which fo­cuses on food and pack­ag­ing waste, was the most promis­ing start-up.</p>
    <p>This award recog­nises emerg­ing en­ter­prises that have de­vel­oped a unique and com­mer­cially vi­able idea with po­ten­tial to be sus­tained in the long run.</p>
    <p>Food re­cy­cling firm Lam Tak re­ceived the sus­tain­abil­ity award, in­tro­duced last year to recog­nise emerg­ing en­ter­prises that help the un­der­served and cre­ate greater good for the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>All the win­ners will re­ceive sup­port in ca­pa­bil­ity de­vel­op­ment from En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The awards, jointly or­gan­ised by The Busi­ness Times and OCBC Bank, are in their 13th year.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing told the vir­tual cer­e­mony of the need to use pub­lic re­sources to help busi­nesses and work­ers adapt amid the dis­rup­tions stem­ming from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He added that the award fi­nal­ists demon­strate Sin­ga­pore’s “can-do” spirit and abil­ity to re­spond nim­bly to chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>“In their spirit of en­ter­prise, they are al­ways search­ing out new op­por­tu­ni­ties – even amid the pan­demic – to de­velop new busi­ness ideas and mod­els, build new ca­pa­bil­i­ties, and leverage in­no­va­tion and new dig­i­tal tools,” Mr Chan said. “When thrown lemons, we make lemon­ade.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will cre­ate the most con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment it can for busi­ness growth, he added, but also urged busi­nesses to work to­gether to keep Sin­ga­pore com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“What­ever we can do, oth­ers can em­u­late and try to do even bet­ter. Hence, be it Gov­ern­ment or busi­nesses, we must con­tinue to work closely to­gether to stay ahead of the com­pe­ti­tion.”</p>
    <p>Busi­ness Times edi­tor Wong Wei Kong noted that the awards started in 2008 dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, so the event is no stranger to crises like the one that has over­shad­owed this year.</p>
    <p>“It is en­cour­ag­ing to see that even in the pan­demic, there are still promis­ing, in­no­va­tive en­ter­prises mark­ing out growth paths for them­selves,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Li­nus Goh, head of global com­mer­cial bank­ing at OCBC, noted: “A sus­tain­abil­ity strat­egy is nec­es­sary to ‘fu­ture-proof’ busi­nesses and ad­dress chang­ing stake­holder ex­pec­ta­tions, but at the same time, also opens up new op­por­tu­ni­ties to gain com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages, which many are be­gin­ning to cap­i­talise on.”</p>
    <p>The awards are sup­ported by R S M, Ma s t e r c a r d , Sing­tel, Acorn, Rajah & Tann Le­gal Basix, Wave­maker and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It is en­cour­ag­ing to see that even in the pan­demic, there are still promis­ing, in­no­va­tive en­ter­prises mark­ing out growth paths for them­selves.</p>
