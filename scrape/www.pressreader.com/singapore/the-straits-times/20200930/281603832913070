    <p>Hong Kong is gear­ing up for po­ten­tial clashes at the start of a long week­end de­spite a ban on an an­nual march by a key hu­man rights group. Some 6,000 po­lice of­fi­cers are ex­pected to be de­ployed to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties are gear­ing up for po­ten­tial clashes at the start of a long week­end de­spite a ban on what would have been an an­nual march by a key hu­man rights group, with some 6,000 po­lice of­fi­cers ex­pected to be de­ployed to­mor­row, which is China’s Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia HK01 and Sing Tao re­ported that the ini­tial es­ti­mated de­ploy­ment is dou­ble the orig­i­nal num­ber, given the risks.</p>
    <p>The news comes as calls cir­cu­late on­line and via so­cial me­dia for peo­ple to join protests urg­ing Bei­jing to re­turn the 12 Hong Kongers who il­le­gally en­tered Chi­nese waters.</p>
    <p>The 12, all of whom face charges linked to last year’s un­rest in the city, are be­ing held with­out charge in Shen­zhen since they were ar­rested while at­tempt­ing to flee via speed­boat to Tai­wan in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The dozen in­di­vid­u­als had ear­lier been ar­rested un­der Hong Kong’s na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the ap­peal board on Mon­day up­held a po­lice de­ci­sion to ban an ap­pli­ca­tion from the Civil Hu­man Rights Front (CHRF) for a march from Cause­way Bay to Cen­tral, in what would have been Hong Kong’s largest au­tho­rised protest in months.</p>
    <p>The board agreed that a march on Oct 1, also the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val, would put public health at risk.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite CHRF sug­gest­ing that the marchers adopt so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in­clud­ing wear­ing face masks and walk­ing in groups of no more than four – the cap on public gath­er­ings un­der cur­rent re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>CHRF had or­gan­ised some of the city’s largest-ever protests, in­clud­ing peace­ful ral­lies against the con­tentious and ex­tra­di­tion Bill last year that drew mil­lions to the streets and paved the way for the pro­posal by Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam to be with­drawn.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Hong Kong has im­proved over the past two weeks with daily new in­fec­tions fall­ing from the three-digit fig­ures in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The city recorded 5,079 con­firmed cases, in­clud­ing 105 deaths, yesterday.</p>
    <p>The Se­cu­rity Bureau on Mon­day said it was aware “that some peo­ple on the In­ter­net claim that they will con­tinue to take part in the pro­ces­sion re­gard­less of whether it is au­tho­rised or not, and ad­vo­cate the use of vi­o­lence, in­clud­ing hurling petrol bombs and il­le­gally block­ing roads, in mak­ing their de­mands”.</p>
    <p>It con­demned such acts, adding that any­one found tak­ing part in an unau­tho­rised assem­bly is li­able to a max­i­mum penalty of five years’ im­pris­on­ment, while ri­ot­ers face a jail term of up to 10 years.</p>
    <p>In a Sept 7 threat as­sess­ment re­port, Steve Vick­ers and As­so­ciates noted that sta­bil­ity has re­turned to the city de­spite the po­lit­i­cal di­vide.</p>
    <p>The po­lice, it said, have ar­rested var­i­ous peo­ple un­der the na­tional se­cu­rity law, in­clud­ing me­dia ty­coon Jimmy Lai on Aug 10 in a much-pub­li­cised raid on the Ap­ple Daily news­pa­per of­fices, as well as al­most 300 peo­ple in re­la­tion to protests on Sept 6 – the day Hong Kong’s Leg­isla­tive Council elec­tion was orig­i­nally sched­uled to be held – in Mong Kok and Yau Ma Tei.</p>
    <p>“The over­all re­sult is a re­turn to com­par­a­tive sta­bil­ity,” the re­port noted, adding that protest numbers have fallen as demon­stra­tors have sought to flee.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day evening, about 20 gath­ered at the Pa­cific Place mall in Ad­mi­ralty to mark the sixth an­niver­sary of the start of the Um­brella Move­ment in 2014, chant­ing anti-govern­ment slo­gans and singing protest songs. Po­lice urged them to dis­perse and there were no clashes.</p>
    <p>Calls for peo­ple to join free-style as­sem­blies to­mor­row have drawn the ire of Bei­jing’s li­ai­son of­fice.</p>
    <p>It said yesterday in a state­ment that on­line de­mands for the 12 Hong Kong ac­tivists de­tained on the main­land to be re­leased were “ab­surd”, adding: “Those who vi­o­late the law must be pun­ished by the law, which is com­mon knowl­edge.” It also said that some rad­i­cals had called for at­tacks on po­lice sta­tions, or called on peo­ple to buy weapons – ac­tions that breach the na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
