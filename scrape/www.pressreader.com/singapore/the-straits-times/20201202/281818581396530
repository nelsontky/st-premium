    <p>BRUSSELS • A high-level look at the North At­lantic Treaty Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (Nato) next 10 years rec­om­mends sig­nif­i­cant changes to con­front the new chal­lenges of an ag­gres­sive Rus­sia and a ris­ing China, urg­ing over­hauls to for­tify the al­liance’s co­he­sion and bet­ter co­or­di­nate with demo­cratic al­lies around the world.</p>
    <p>Nato did well boosting mil­i­tary de­ter­rence af­ter the Rus­sian in­va­sion of Ukraine and an­nex­a­tion of Crimea in 2014, the re­port com­mis­sioned by the al­liance says.</p>
    <p>But with a sim­i­lar chal­lenge to the West aris­ing from an am­bi­tious and au­thor­i­tar­ian China, it says the al­liance now needs to make sim­i­lar ad­vances on the po­lit­i­cal side, in­clud­ing reach­ing out more con­sis­tently to Asian al­lies anx­ious about Bei­jing’s am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>Cov­er­ing 138 spe­cific rec­om­men­da­tions in some 60 pages, the re­port was to be a ma­jor source of dis­cus­sion yes­ter­day, the start of a two-day meet­ing of Nato for­eign min­is­ters that is likely to be the last for United States Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo.</p>
    <p>The re­port was re­quested by Nato sec­re­tary-gen­eral Jens Stoltenber­g af­ter French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said a year ago that Nato was ex­pe­ri­enc­ing “brain death” be­cause of a lack of strate­gic co­or­di­na­tion and US lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a diplo­mat from a Nato coun­try, the re­port is a kind of ri­poste to Mr Macron but also an ef­fort to re­spond to his le­git­i­mate crit­i­cisms of an al­liance that has been slow to adapt its struc­tures and its reach, and where de­ci­sion­mak­ing is a cum­ber­some and of­ten ar­du­ous process that hin­ders quick re­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>A co-chair­man of the 10-mem­ber group of ex­perts, Dr A. Wess Mitchell, told Nato am­bas­sadors in a pri­vate brief­ing that the re­port showed that “Nato is alive and kick</p>
    <p>ing both in its cere­bral func­tion and its mus­cle tis­sue”.</p>
    <p>“Our in­ten­tion is to be can­did about the chal­lenges to Nato, with a tone of well-grounded op­ti­mism,” said Mr Mitchell, a for­mer US as­sis­tant sec­re­tary of state for Europe.</p>
    <p>The main mes­sage, he said, is that “Nato has to adapt it­self for an era of strate­gic ri­valry with Rus­sia and China, for the re­turn of a geopo­lit­i­cal com­pe­ti­tion that has a mil­i­tary di­men­sion and a po­lit­i­cal one”.</p>
    <p>Nato, he added, is “first and fore­most an al­liance of Euro-At­lantic democ­ra­cies, and must evolve po­lit­i­cally to match its mil­i­tary evo­lu­tion”. In this new world, in­ter­nal di­vi­sion is dam­ag­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>The re­port sug­gests ways to speed up de­ci­sions. For ex­am­ple, nu­mer­ous Nato part­ner­ship de­ci­sions with coun­tries such as Is­rael and even Aus­tria are be­ing held up by one coun­try, in this case, Turkey.</p>
    <p>It also sug­gests that such dis­putes be raised at the min­is­te­rial level, not left to am­bas­sadors.</p>
    <p>China is a sig­nif­i­cant part of the re­port, and it rec­om­mends set­ting up a con­sul­ta­tive body to co­or­di­nate Western pol­icy to­wards Bei­jing and to high­light Chi­nese ac­tiv­i­ties that could af­fect Western se­cu­rity, such as spy­ing, sup­ply chains and arms build-ups.</p>
    <p>With its tech­no­log­i­cal am­bi­tions, mil­i­tary ex­pan­sion and trade poli­cies, China can no longer be seen as sim­ply an Asian player, the re­port ar­gues, and Nato has been slow to re­spond to this.</p>
    <p>The re­port urges the cre­ation of an­a­lyt­i­cal cen­tres bet­ter able to study dis­rup­tive and emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies and to bet­ter use ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>It should also use those ca­pac­i­ties to im­prove the fight against ter­ror­ism and bet­ter co­or­di­nate poli­cies that de­fend Nato’s south­ern mem­bers.</p>
