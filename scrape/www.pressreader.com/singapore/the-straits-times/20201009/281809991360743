    <p>Economists say a new aid pack­age to fol­low on the US$2.2 tril­lion (S$3 tril­lion) Cares pack­age ap­proved in late March, much of which has ex­pired, is crit­i­cal to shoring up the world’s largest econ­omy and staving off mas­sive lay­offs amid the down­turn caused by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said talks on pro­vid­ing ad­di­tional fis­cal stim­u­lus are now “start­ing to work out”, af­ter he pulled his side out of ne­go­ti­a­tions ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>“I think we have a re­ally good chance of do­ing some­thing,” Mr Trump said yes­ter­day morn­ing in a live in­ter­view on Fox Business. There are now “very pro­duc­tive talks” on coro­n­avirus re­lief, he said.</p>
    <p>Months of hard-fought ne­go­ti­a­tions on a stim­u­lus pack­age to shore up a slow­ing eco­nomic re­cov­ery came to an abrupt end on Tues­day, when Mr Trump pulled his team out of the talks.</p>
    <p>He then called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to send him stand­alone as­sis­tance Bills, in­clud­ing for air­lines and in­di­vid­ual stim­u­lus che­ques.</p>
    <p>Mrs Pelosi and Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin held phone calls on Wed­nes­day on po­ten­tial aid for the air­line in­dus­try, but the Speaker’s re­cep­tive­ness did not ap­pear to ex­tend to other el­e­ments of what was to have been a com­pre­hen­sive re­lief pack­age.</p>
    <p>Mrs Pelosi on Wed­nes­day re­jected pres­sure from Mr Trump to green-light a Bill au­tho­ris­ing US$1,200 (S$1,630) in­di­vid­ual stim­u­lus che­ques, say­ing that was in­suf­fi­cient to ad­dress the Covid-19 chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump claimed yes­ter­day morn­ing that those che­ques and other mea­sures are on the ta­ble, how­ever. “We started talk­ing again. And we’re talk­ing about air­lines and we’re talk­ing about a big­ger deal than air­lines,” he said. “We’re talk­ing about a deal with US$1,200 per per­son, we’re talk­ing about other things.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Ham­mill tweeted on Wed­nes­day that the Speaker and Mr Mnuchin agreed to talk again yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Con­tin­u­ing hopes for a stim­u­lus deal have con­trib­uted to gains in stocks since they tanked in the wake of Mr Trump’s an­nounce­ment on Tues­day about pulling out of the ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Mnuchin’s calls on Wed­nes­day un­der­scored the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s con­cern about the state of the air­line in­dus­try, which has been wal­loped by the Covid-19 cri­sis and seen tens of thou­sands of job cuts.</p>
    <p>Car­ri­ers have fur­loughed about 38,000 peo­ple since Oct 1, in­clud­ing ma­jor lay­offs at Amer­i­can Air­lines Group and United Air­lines. An air­line Bill could be ap­proved as soon as this week, but it would take unan­i­mous con­sent in both the House and Se­nate to do so.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment report yes­ter­day show­cased the con­tin­u­ing im­pact of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis on the job mar­ket, with 840,000 ini­tial claims for un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance in the most re­cent week in reg­u­lar state pro­grammes. That is more than quadru­ple the level be­fore the pan­demic hit, and higher than the peak of the 2007-09 re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral Re­serve of­fi­cials led by chair­man Jerome Pow­ell this week stepped up their calls for a broad re­lief pack­age to help the un­em­ployed and en­dan­gered busi­nesses, high­light­ing con­cern about un­der­min­ing the eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing an ap­pear­ance on Wed­nes­day on ABC, Mrs Pelosi did not ex­plic­itly shut the door on con­tin­u­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions with Mr Trump and the ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she did dis­par­age the idea of just send­ing stim­u­lus che­ques with­out the other re­lief Democrats have been seek­ing.</p>
