    <p>PETALING JAYA • Malaysia’s Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) pres­i­dent An­war Ibrahim says he now re­alises that he was duped by Tun Dr Mahathir Mo­hamad when the lat­ter promised to hand over the coun­try’s top job to him, Sin Chew Daily re­ported.</p>
    <p>In an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view with the news­pa­per, Datuk Seri An­war, leader of the op­po­si­tion Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion, said that right from the get go, he had be­lieved that then Prime Min­is­ter Mahathir would ful­fil the pact’s agree­ment to hand over the ba­ton to him af­ter serv­ing two years in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Dr Mahathir was prime min­is­ter from May 2018, af­ter PH won the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“We did not know ear­lier but we know now,” Mr An­war was quoted as say­ing in the in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Dr Mahathir kept mov­ing the date for the han­dover be­fore fi­nally say­ing he would va­cate the post only af­ter the Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion meet­ing this Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>On Feb 24, Dr Mahathir re­signed as prime min­is­ter with­out in­form­ing PH party lead­ers. Law­mak­ers from his Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia then ex­ited PH, leav­ing the coali­tion short of a ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>This led to the col­lapse of the PHled govern­ment, which voided the suc­ces­sion plan.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war said he knew many were against him be­com­ing prime min­is­ter. “Many bil­lion­aires, in­clud­ing a rich Malay whom I know. I also know those cor­rupt ones were against me too. They are play­ing the racial card by say­ing ‘An­war is not very Malay, and he does not pro­tect the Malays’.”</p>
    <p>The former deputy prime min­is­ter said he be­lieved in en­hanc­ing the econ­omy for all Malaysians.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one can be suc­cess­ful. We should sup­port the ones with po­ten­tial, in­clud­ing Chi­nese en­trepreneur­s. I am con­cerned with the wel­fare of the peo­ple. I hate those who steal from the poor.”</p>
    <p>Mr An­war also main­tained that Dr Mahathir’s res­ig­na­tion as prime min­is­ter was the main cause of the col­lapse of the 22-month-old PH govern­ment. If Dr Mahathir did not re­sign, PH would still be the govern­ment now, he said, adding that all in­ter­nal coali­tion is­sues could have been dealt with.</p>
    <p>“It is a fact there are traitors in PKR and Parti Pribumi Ber­satu</p>
    <p>Malaysia. But do you think those traitors mush­roomed in one week? They must have planned this a long time ago. The ques­tion is, why do we al­low such a sce­nario to oc­cur?”</p>
    <p>He also said he did not know whether Dr Mahathir, who is former Ber­satu chair­man, was re­spon­si­ble for plan­ning the exit of Ber­satu from PH.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war de­nied, how­ever, that Dr Mahathir re­signed due to pres­sure from PKR grass­roots for him to va­cate the post to make way for Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>“Why was there pres­sure? Be­cause he (Dr Mahathir) did not seem to be leav­ing,” said Mr An­war, who added that while he could still communicat­e with Dr Mahathir, he would never en­dorse him as prime min­is­ter again.</p>
    <p>“Dr Mahathir is un­able to garner sup­port (to rule) from the ma­jor­ity of MPs,” said Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>TRAITORS</p>
    <p>It is a fact there are traitors in PKR and Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia. But do you think those traitors mush­roomed in one week? They must have planned this a long time ago. The ques­tion is, why do we al­low such a sce­nario to oc­cur?</p>
