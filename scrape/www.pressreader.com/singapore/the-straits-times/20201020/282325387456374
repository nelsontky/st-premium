    <p>•</p>
    <p>Jose Mour­inho ques­tioned Tot­ten­ham’s men­tal strength af­ter a stun­ning late col­lapse saw West Ham fight back from 3-0 down in the fi­nal eight min­utes to draw 3-3 on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>No side in Pre­mier League his­tory had ever come from 3-0 down af­ter the 81st minute, and with the way Spurs were dom­i­nat­ing at home, no one saw the ca­pit­u­la­tion com­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, af­ter Mour­inho sub­sti­tuted Tan­guy Ndombele i n the 73rd minute and then Son He­ung­min seven min­utes later with the points seem­ingly in the bag, the hosts lost their shape and the Ham­mers took ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>Manuel Lanzini’s sen­sa­tional 94th-minute long-range strike into the top cor­ner capped the come­back af­ter Fabian Bal­buena and Davin­son Sanchez’s own goal res­ur­rected David Moyes’ men, leav­ing the Spurs manager and Son to lament their team’s fragility.</p>
    <p>“This was a game we had in the pocket and we lost two points,” said Mour­inho. “Af­ter the first goal their be­lief went up. My guys were not strong enough to cope with it psy­cho­log­i­cally in the last few sec­onds.”</p>
    <p>Spurs had raced to a 3-0 lead within 16 min­utes as the free-scor­ing com­bi­na­tion of Harry Kane (dou­ble) and Son (one) threat­ened to turn the game into a past­ing.</p>
    <p>Kane also hit the post late on and Gareth Bale would have been the head­line maker had he beaten Lukasz Fabi­an­ski in an one-on-one sit­u­a­tion af­ter com­ing on as a se­cond-half sub­sti­tute to mark his se­cond homecoming with the north London club.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the misses did not ap­pear costly until the eight min­utes of mad­ness, much to Son’s cha­grin.</p>
    <p>“We should re­mem­ber this feel­ing for­ever so it never hap­pens again,” said the South Korea for­ward.</p>
    <p>“It is just so sad that we lost a big two points, when we as a col­lec­tive played so well and as a team dom­i­nated and con­trolled the game, to draw the game feels like we lost.”</p>
    <p>The dropped points led to plenty of crit­i­cism of Mour­inho’s de­ci­sion not to start Bale, but the Por­tuguese claimed ev­ery­thing was rosy until the in­ex­pli­ca­ble hap­pened.</p>
    <p>“Don’t think so, hon­estly don’t think so. The de­ci­sion not to start him was, I think, a good de­ci­sion,” he said. “A de­ci­sion to show that he doesn’t have a beau­ti­ful chair wait­ing for him in the team and he sits there the first time he can.</p>
    <p>“So ev­ery­thing is pos­i­tive and the focus was not on him. The focus was on the game and he was on the bench for 65 min­utes or so and I don’t think so, I don’t think at all.</p>
    <p>“It’s a pity that he couldn’t score that fourth goal which was a beauty and would have killed the game. That’s foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>Ham­mers boss Moyes, on the other hand, was left de­lighted with the turn­around.</p>
    <p>This was his first game in the dugout af­ter miss­ing the last four in all com­pe­ti­tions due to a pos­i­tive Covid-19 test. And up until the end, the Scot had been wish­ing he was still work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors had trounced both Wolves and Le­ices­ter in suc­ces­sion while he was self-iso­lat­ing but still call­ing the shots, so he ad­mit­ted it was “a re­ally proud mo­ment” that his team con­tin­ued to be spoil­ers against the odds.</p>
    <p>He added: “They never gave in, they kept go­ing, it’s a big re­sult.”</p>
