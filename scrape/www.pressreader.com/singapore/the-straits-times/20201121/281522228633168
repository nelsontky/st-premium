    <p>A Court of Three Judges has sus­pended se­nior lawyer Lee Suet Fern for 15 months af­ter she was found guilty of “mis­con­duct un­be­fit­ting an ad­vo­cate and so­lic­i­tor” in her han­dling of the last will of her late fa­ther-in-law Lee Kuan Yew. It said she did not con­sider Mr Lee’s in­ter­est in act­ing at the be­hest of her hus­band.</p>
    <p>Se­nior lawyer Lee Suet Fern has been sus­pended for 15 months by a Court of Three Judges over her han­dling of the last will of her late fa­ther-in-law Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
    <p>The high­est dis­ci­plinary body for the le­gal pro­fes­sion found her guilty of mis­con­duct un­be­fit­ting an ad­vo­cate and so­lic­i­tor.</p>
    <p>She had “blindly fol­lowed the di­rec­tions of her hus­band, a sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fi­ciary un­der the very will whose ex­e­cu­tion she helped to rush through”, it said in a writ­ten judg­ment re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This fol­lowed a hear­ing in Au­gust, af­ter the Law So­ci­ety ap­plied to have Mrs Lee struck off the roll.</p>
    <p>A dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal (DT) had ear­lier this year found that she and her hus­band had mis­led the se­nior Mr Lee to sign a new will with­out the ad­vice of his usual lawyer, Ms Kwa Kim Li.</p>
    <p>While the court found Mrs Lee and the se­nior Mr Lee were not in a lawyer-client re­la­tion­ship – which would have made her con­duct more grave – it agreed with the DT that she was guilty of mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>The case cen­tred on the role she played in the prepa­ra­tion and ex­e­cu­tion of Mr Lee’s last will, which was signed on Dec 17, 2013.</p>
    <p>His last will dif­fered from his sixth and penul­ti­mate will in sig­nif­i­cant ways, in­clud­ing the dis­tri­bu­tion of his es­tate among his three chil­dren as well as the de­mo­li­tion of his house at 38 Ox­ley Road.</p>
    <p>It also did not con­tain some changes he had wanted and dis­cussed with Ms Kwa four days ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The DT had found Mrs Lee guilty of grossly im­proper pro­fes­sional con­duct in Fe­bru­ary this year.</p>
    <p>The Law So­ci­ety sub­se­quently ap­plied to have her struck off the roll, and the case was re­ferred to a Court of Three Judges.</p>
    <p>The court held a vir­tual hear­ing in Au­gust, where the Law So­ci­ety set out its ar­gu­ments for why she should be dis­barred, while Mrs Lee’s lawyers called for all charges to be dropped.</p>
    <p>In its 98-page j udg­ment, the court, com­pris­ing Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, Judge of Ap­peal Ju­dith Prakash and Jus­tice Woo Bih Li, said Mrs Lee had acted at the be­hest of her hus­band to push through the ex­e­cu­tion of the will in an “un­seemly rush”.</p>
    <p>The will was signed 16 hours af­ter she sent a draft of it to Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>The court noted that she had for­warded the draft, which was to have been based on the first will, with­out ver­i­fy­ing if it was the cor­rect ver­sion.</p>
    <p>This showed a “no­table lack of dili­gence” on her part, it added.</p>
    <p>She was also con­tent to have Mr Lee sign the last will on the ba­sis of her “un­con­firmed and ul­ti­mately un­true rep­re­sen­ta­tion”.</p>
    <p>She did it even though she knew she had no way of ver­i­fy­ing the draft since she did not have the signed ver­sion of the first will.</p>
    <p>As such, it was “clearly im­pru­dent and grossly neg­li­gent” for her to have held out the rep­re­sen­ta­tions she made about the draft last will as true.</p>
    <p>The court fur­ther said when Ms Kwa – who had drafted and ex­e­cuted the se­nior Mr Lee’s first to sixth wills – was left out of the emails by Mrs Lee’s hus­band, Mr Lee Hsien Yang, Mrs Lee ac­qui­esced to it and did not seem to pause to re­con­sider her po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>On the con­trary, she had gone ahead to act on her hus­band’s wish to have the last will ex­e­cuted with “seem­ing haste” by ar­rang­ing for her col­leagues Bernard Lui and El­iz­a­beth Kong to wit­ness the sign­ing.</p>
    <p>She did it even be­fore the se­nior Mr Lee had re­sponded to his son Lee Hsien Yang’s sug­ges­tion to pro­ceed.</p>
    <p>This ac­tion ef­fec­tively as­sured her fa­ther-in-law the re­quired checks had been done to make sure the draft last will re­flected his wishes, the court said. It also noted she had con­ceded her fa­ther-in­law would have be­lieved and re­lied on her rep­re­sen­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing Mrs Lee’s con­duct as “es­pe­cially un­sat­is­fac­tory”, the court added that there was a “re­mark­able lack of dili­gence” on her part in en­sur­ing her fa­ther-in­law’s wishes were prop­erly as­cer­tained and car­ried out.</p>
    <p>The court noted, among other things, that she sub­se­quently did not up­date Ms Kwa fully and frankly about what had tran­spired, and merely wrote her an in­nocu­ous quick note which said the will had been signed.</p>
    <p>Whether in­ten­tion­ally or not, it left Ms Kwa with the im­pres­sion there was noth­ing left for her to do, and re­moved any signs for any cause for con­cern on her part, it said.</p>
    <p>It also said Mrs Lee might have mit­i­gated her cul­pa­bil­ity if she had briefed Ms Kwa fully on the cir­cum­stances sur­round­ing the sign­ing of the will.</p>
    <p>This might have con­veyed some of the sud­den ur­gency with which mat­ters had pro­ceeded and prompted fur­ther in­quiry from Ms Kwa. “How­ever, none of this was done,” it added.</p>
    <p>Given her 37 years of ex­pe­ri­ence, it noted “she could not have failed to know that the verac­ity of her rep­re­sen­ta­tions was some­thing that ab­so­lutely needed to be checked”.</p>
    <p>The court added: “It is sim­ply un­ten­able that the need for cau­tion, re­straint and cir­cum­spec­tion did not strike (Mrs Lee).”</p>
    <p>In un­der­lin­ing the im­por­tance of deal­ing with wills, the court re­jected the ar­gu­ment made by Mrs Lee’s lawyer, Pro­fes­sor Wal­ter Woon, that it was suf­fi­cient the draft sent to her fa­ther-in-law was broadly sim­i­lar to the ver­sion he had wanted.</p>
    <p>This, the court said, sug­gests it is unim­por­tant to en­sure wills ac­cu­rately re­flect a tes­ta­tor’s in­ten­tions.</p>
    <p>“A so­lic­i­tor who fails to act with ex­cep­tional care and, where ap­pro­pri­ate, as it is here, with re­straint and cir­cum­spec­tion must be pre­pared to have her con­duct scru­ti­nised and, per­haps, even her mo­tives called into ques­tion,” it added.</p>
