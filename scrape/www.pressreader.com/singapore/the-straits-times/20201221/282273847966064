    <p>Ques­tions of law emerged in re­la­tion to the law­suit filed against Work­ers’ Party (WP) MPs Sylvia Lim and Pri­tam Singh and oth­ers fol­low­ing the re­draw­ing of bound­aries for the gen­eral elec­tion in July.</p>
    <p>Pung­gol East, a sin­gle-mem­ber con­stituency (SMC) un­der WP from 2013 to 2015 fol­low­ing a by­elec­tion, is a party in the case.</p>
    <p>In 2015, the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion</p>
    <p>Party won the SMC. But fol­low­ing changes to the elec­toral bound­aries in this year’s elec­tion, Pung­gol East be­came part of Sengkang GRC, which was won by the WP.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion re­sult means the for­mer SMC now comes un­der the new Sengkang Town Coun­cil (SKTC), whose in­de­pen­dent panel has ap­pointed a new le­gal team led by Ms Ma­rina Chin of Tan Kok Quan Part­ner­ship to han­dle an ap­peal filed by its pre­de­ces­sor Pung­gol East along­side the WP-run Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil (AHTC).</p>
    <p>The Court of Ap­peal hear­ing due last month was post­poned to early next year at the law firm’s re­quest.</p>
    <p>The firm said that with the changes to elec­toral bound­aries, the case may now be in ef­fect an ap­peal pur­sued by SKTC. “It in­volves novel and com­plex is­sues of law,” it said in its re­quest filed in court.</p>
    <p>Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil had filed le­gal pa­pers to re­cover al­leged losses in­curred by Pung­gol East when it was an SMC un­der WP. It ini­ti­ated the civil suit af­ter AHTC took Ms Lim and the oth­ers to court.</p>
