    <p>Doc­tors rec­om­mend car­diac screen­ing tests for com­pet­i­tive ath­letes who have re­cov­ered from Covid-19 af­ter a small study found heart dam­age in one of ev­ery seven col­lege sports com­peti­tors, in­clud­ing in those whose coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion caused no ob­vi­ous symp­toms.</p>
    <p>Car­diac mag­netic res­o­nance imag­ing on 26 com­pet­i­tive col­lege ath­letes who had ei­ther a mild or asymp­to­matic Sars-CoV-2 in­fec­tion found four, or 15 per cent, with signs of in­flam­ma­tion of the heart mus­cle.</p>
    <p>Th­ese sus­pected my­ocardi­tis pa­tients were males in their late teens and early 20s, in­clud­ing two who ex­pe­ri­enced no Covid-19 symp­toms, doc­tors at Ohio State Univer­sity in Colum­bus re­ported this month in a re­search let­ter to the Jour­nal of the Amer­i­can Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The find­ing adds to a growing body of ev­i­dence that the pneu­mo­nia-caus­ing coro­n­avirus is also re­sult­ing in dam­age to the heart, as well as other or­gans. While lit­tle is known about the long-term car­diac con­se­quences, screen­ing for heart com­pli­ca­tions may iden­tify peo­ple at risk of fur­ther in­jury, the re­searchers said.</p>
    <p>“My­ocardi­tis is a sig­nif­i­cant cause of sud­den car­diac death in com­pet­i­tive ath­letes,” Sau­rabh Ra­j­pal, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of in­ter­nal medicine, and col­leagues wrote.</p>
    <p>“Car­diac mag­netic res­o­nance imag­ing has the po­ten­tial to iden­tify a high-risk co­hort for ad­verse out­comes and may, im­por­tantly, risk-strat­ify ath­letes for safe par­tic­i­pa­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ev­i­dence of my­ocar­dial in­flam­ma­tion seen on car­diac MRI scans has been as­so­ci­ated “with poor out­comes, in­clud­ing my­ocar­dial dys­func­tion and mor­tal­ity”, the au­thors said. Ath­letes with prob­a­ble my­ocardi­tis should be asked to rest for three months to re­cover, based on cur­rent guide­lines, Dr Ra­j­pal said in an e-mail.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tional re­search is needed to de­ter­mine whether that can pre­vent fur­ther in­jury, he said.</p>
    <p>None of the ath­letes – who were Amer­i­can foot­ball, foot­ball, lacrosse, bas­ket­ball, and track com­peti­tors – had known heart dis­ease when they un­der­went post-Covid test­ing. An ad­di­tional eight ath­letes, or 31 per cent, showed signs of prior heart-mus­cle in­jury which, Dr Ra­j­pal said, may also have been the re­sult of ath­letic car­diac adap­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Highly trained en­durance ath­letes are 10 times more likely than non-ath­letes to have signs of heart stress, a car­diac MRI study this month found.</p>
    <p>The Ohio study was not de­signed to iden­tify the preva­lence or risk of my­ocar­dial in­jury in ath­letes with a re­cent his­tory of Sars-CoV-2 in­fec­tion, Dr Ra­j­pal said.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther stud­ies are planned in which ath­letes not af­fected by the coro­n­avirus will also be as­sessed for com­par­i­son.</p>
    <p>More re­search is also needed to un­der­stand the long-term con­se­quences of Covid-19 on the hearts of young ath­letes, he said.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns about still un­known health ef­fects caused two ma­jor col­le­giate ath­letic con­fer­ences in the US to halt their up­com­ing sports sea­sons. Oth­ers have pressed for­ward and col­lege and pro­fes­sional foot­ball sea­sons have started.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can Col­lege of Car­di­ol­ogy’s Sports and Ex­er­cise Car­di­ol­ogy Coun­cil in May de­vel­oped guide­lines for let­ting ath­letes re­turn to play. They vary based on the sever­ity of a per­son’s ill­ness, rec­om­mend­ing any­one who tests pos­i­tive to rest for two weeks and those who ex­pe­ri­enced mild or se­vere symp­toms to be eval­u­ated by a med­i­cal pro­fes­sional.</p>
    <p>How­ever, emerg­ing knowl­edge and car­dio­vas­cu­lar MRI ob­ser­va­tions “ques­tion this rec­om­men­da­tion”, the Ohio re­searchers said.</p>
    <p>Though most cases of my­ocardi­tis re­sult in “a good de­gree of recovery”, some pa­tients will suf­fer scar­ring and po­ten­tially se­vere com­pli­ca­tions, said Garry Jen­nings, a car­di­ol­o­gist and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Syd­ney Health Part­ners, an Aus­tralian med­i­cal re­search group.</p>
    <p>Longer-term prob­lems in­clude ab­nor­mal heart rhythms, chronic heart fail­ure and sud­den death.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Jen­nings rec­om­mends that ath­letes who test pos­i­tive for Sars-CoV-2 with­out Covid-19 symp­toms rest for two weeks and then un­dergo a med­i­cal check-up be­fore re­sum­ing train­ing.</p>
    <p>“De­pend­ing on the level of ex­er­cise, they need to go slow and in­crease grad­u­ally and ob­vi­ously re­port any symp­toms,” he said. “For peo­ple with more mod­er­ate or se­vere Covid, you need to be much more con­ser­va­tive than that.”</p>
    <p>Ide­ally, such ath­letes should un­dergo car­diac imag­ing, plus a blood test for tro­ponin – which may in­di­cate heart-mus­cle dam­age – to rule out on­go­ing my­ocar­dial dam­age that would pre­dis­pose the heart to ad­di­tional strain, he said.</p>
    <p>Wor­ries around heart in­flam­ma­tion and other pos­si­ble side ef­fects are dom­i­nat­ing con­ver­sa­tions with ath­letes, said Ju­lia Iafrate, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and re­gen­er­a­tive medicine and di­rec­tor of dance medicine at Columbia Univer­sity in New York.</p>
    <p>She tries to re­mind peo­ple that they are see­ing re­search un­fold in real time and what is ac­cu­rate today might not be ac­cu­rate in a few months.</p>
    <p>A study in July of 100 re­cently re­cov­ered Covid-19 pa­tients in Ger­many found that more than three­quar­ters ex­pe­ri­enced some heart prob­lems and 60 per cent suf­fered on­go­ing my­ocar­dial in­flam­ma­tion, re­gard­less of any pre-ex­ist­ing con­di­tions and the sever­ity of their coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion. The risk may ex­tend to in­fants, too.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors in the Turk­ish cap­i­tal Ankara re­ported di­rect Sars-CoV-2 dam­age last month in a fa­tal case of vi­ral my­ocardi­tis in an oth­er­wise healthy two-year-old boy. Be­ing young and healthy is not a rea­son to brush off the coro­n­avirus, Dr Iafrate said.</p>
    <p>“We know you’re bet­ter off not get­ting Covid,” she said.</p>
