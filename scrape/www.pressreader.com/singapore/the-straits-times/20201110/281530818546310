    <p>Myan­mar’s rul­ing National League for Democ­racy (NLD) has won enough votes to form the gov­ern­ment, the party said af­ter Sun­day’s gen­eral elec­tion which drew a large turnout de­spite the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We have enough seats to form the gov­ern­ment, or per­haps even more than needed,” NLD spokesman Monywa Aung Shin told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Although of­fi­cial re­sults have not yet been an­nounced, he con­firmed that NLD leader and state coun­sel­lor Aung San Suu Kyi suc­cess­fully de­fended her Lower House seat in Kawhmu town­ship. Pres­i­dent Win Myint, rep­re­sent­ing the NLD in Yangon’s Tamwe town­ship, sim­i­larly beat off other chal­lengers, he said.</p>
    <p>The vote, the sec­ond since Myan­mar eased out of di­rect mil­i­tary rule in 2011, was seen as a gauge of pop­u­lar sup­port for the NLD, which was widely ex­pected to win.</p>
    <p>Un­der a power-shar­ing sys­tem drawn up by the for­mer rul­ing junta, 25 per cent of all Par­lia­ment seats are reserved for the mil­i­tary, which also con­trols the de­fence, home af­fairs and bor­der af­fairs min­istries.</p>
    <p>In 2015, the NLD won al­most 80 per cent of con­tested seats in the Up­per and Lower Houses. But it has since dis­ap­pointed eth­nic mi­nor­ity al­lies, among other groups, which have tried to go their own in this elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Vot­ing was can­celled in some ar­eas, in­clud­ing much of Rakhine state where the mil­i­tary is wag­ing war against the eth­nic Rakhine Arakan Army.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing into ac­count th­ese can­cel­la­tions, the NLD needs to win at least 322 Par­lia­ment seats this time so that it can gov­ern with­out turn­ing to ap­pointees of the mil­i­tary or its proxy, the Union Sol­i­dar­ity and De­vel­op­ment Party.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion was held amid a surg­ing Covid-19 out­break, which has killed at least 1,420 in Myan­mar so far. The num­ber of in­fec­tions, which reached 61,975 yes­ter­day, has been climb­ing by some 1,000 or more each day.</p>
    <p>Although the elec­tion com­mis­sion was heav­ily crit­i­cised for its opaque de­ci­sions be­fore the polls, ob­servers noted that the ac­tual event went fairly well.</p>
    <p>The Yangon-based Peo­ple’s Al­liance for Cred­i­ble Elec­tions, in a re­port re­leased yes­ter­day, said the elec­tion went gen­er­ally smoothly de­spite the dif­fi­cul­ties caused by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to state me­dia, 5,639 can­di­dates and 87 po­lit­i­cal par­ties took part in the polls.</p>
    <p>In the week be­fore the elec­tion, pow­er­ful mil­i­tary chief Min Aung Hlaing pub­licly re­buked the elec­tion com­mis­sion and the gov­ern­ment, and re­fused to com­mit to honouring the elec­tion re­sults.</p>
    <p>The ten­sion eased only on Sun­day when he said he would ac­cept the peo­ple’s wishes.</p>
    <p>“I feared some­thing bad would hap­pen,” Kachin state-based voter Jar Seng Bu, 27, told The Straits Times. “But noth­ing hap­pened af­ter the elec­tion. I feel se­cure now, and happy that I could vote.”</p>
    <p>There are pre­lim­i­nary re­ports that the NLD man­aged to widen the ma­jor­ity it won in 2015.</p>
    <p>Mr David Mathieson, an in­de­pen­dent Myan­mar re­searcher, said the pre­lim­i­nary re­sults showed “there is a lot more pa­tience out there than we might have be­lieved”.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple who might ac­tu­ally recog­nise the short­com­ings of the NLD as a gov­ern­ment dis­so­ci­ate Aung San Suu Kyi from that. To them, she can do no wrong.</p>
    <p>“And if things have been slower, and gains much lesser than what many peo­ple have thought, then that’s be­cause (to them) there is a long way to go,” he added.</p>
