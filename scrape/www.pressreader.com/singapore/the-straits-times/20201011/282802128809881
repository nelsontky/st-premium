    <p>It is un­for­tu­nate that most head­line sto­ries about the newly passed Om­nibus Law on Job Cre­ation have sin­gled out the most con­tro­ver­sial of the thou­sands of pro­vi­sions in its 905 pages, only to con­trib­ute to the pub­lic hos­til­ity towards what should be lauded as the most com­pre­hen­sive “big bang” eco­nomic re­form ever launched.</p>
    <p>More than 90 per cent of the law is de­signed to stim­u­late do­mes­tic and for­eign in­vest­ment by re­mov­ing bu­reau­cratic in­ef­fi­cien­cies and ex­ces­sive li­cens­ing re­quire­ments as well as opaque, over­lap­ping and con­tra­dic­tory reg­u­la­tions that have long hin­dered com­pet­i­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>The House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives was prompted to en­dorse the om­nibus Bill by the mis­er­able fail­ure of al­most 20 re­form pack­ages that were launched from 2015 to last year.</p>
    <p>Those re­forms were largely in­ef­fec­tive be­cause their im­ple­men­ta­tion was un­der­mined by the reg­u­la­tory over­lap and con­flict de­riv­ing from about 80 laws as well as thou­sands of pres­i­den­tial reg­u­la­tions and min­is­te­rial de­crees.</p>
    <p>It would have taken more than a decade to re­vise the nu­mer­ous laws and reg­u­la­tions through con­ven­tional law­mak­ing and rau­cous de­lib­er­a­tion with at­ten­dant pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy, al­ready mired in a re­ces­sion, badly needs huge in­vest­ments now to boost growth and cre­ate jobs, and thereby re­duce poverty and in­come in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>The om­nibus law in a sin­gle stroke amends 79 laws and elim­i­nates thou­sands of reg­u­la­tions in­im­i­cal to busi­ness and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>But it will take sev­eral months more to pre­pare all the tech­ni­cal reg­u­la­tions needed to im­ple­ment the new law.</p>
    <p>It is most im­per­a­tive that the govern­ment now fo­cuses its re­sources on com­plet­ing all im­ple­ment­ing reg­u­la­tions and dis­sem­i­nat­ing them pub­licly, no­tably to lo­cal ad­min­is­tra­tions, the busi­ness com­mu­nity and trade unions.</p>
    <p>It is dif­fi­cult to un­der­stand why the trade unions re­main ob­sessed with op­pos­ing the labour pro­vi­sions in the new om­nibus law, be­cause they es­sen­tially main­tain the rights pro­tected in the 2003 Labour Law.</p>
    <p>More­over, only less than 30 per cent of the es­ti­mated 131 mil­lion labour force work in the for­mal sec­tor, which is gov­erned by the labour reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The other 70 per cent are still trapped in the in­for­mal sec­tor, thereby in­el­i­gi­ble for the labour pro­tec­tion as reg­u­lated in the law.</p>
    <p>The labour-in­ten­sive in­dus­tries would re­main unattrac­tive to in­vestors if the labour rules were not amended to boost the com­pet­i­tive­ness of In­done­sian labour against our South-east Asian neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>In a coun­try not known for its worker pro­duc­tiv­ity, the too-rigid labour reg­u­la­tions made it vir­tu­ally im­pos­si­ble to ter­mi­nate the ser­vices of a per­ma­nent em­ployee.</p>
    <p>This turned away count­less po­ten­tial in­vestors and en­cour­aged em­ploy­ers to avoid new hires while re­sort­ing to rolling con­tracts to out­source much of their ex­tra work. The old, in­flex­i­ble labour rules were cer­tainly a great dis­ad­van­tage to em­ploy­ers, be­cause com­pa­nies to­day face a chang­ing eco­nomic land­scape that has vary­ing im­pacts on dif­fer­ent sec­tors.</p>
    <p>The amended pro­vi­sions also will of­fer more flex­i­bil­ity in hir­ing con­tract and out­sourced work­ers so com­pa­nies can adapt to changes as they oc­cur, which is the only cer­tainty in to­day’s busi­ness cli­mate – not­with­stand­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Even with­out the in­flex­i­ble labour reg­u­la­tions, our busi­ness sec­tor has been suf­fer­ing from ma­jor, in­her­ent dis­ad­van­tages in our econ­omy: high lo­gis­tics costs due to ut­terly poor in­fra­struc­ture, ex­ces­sive bu­reau­cratic red tape and high in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>We fully sup­port work­ers’ de­mand for the com­pul­sory min­i­mum wages to at least meet the ba­sic cost of liv­ing so they can lead de­cent lives.</p>
    <p>But we should also ac­cept the ba­sic premise that eco­nomic growth and job cre­ation are in the pub­lic and na­tional in­ter­ests, and that they can be achieved only if there is in­dus­trial peace and eq­ui­table dis­tri­bu­tion of eco­nomic gains.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ably, the govern­ment should be heav­ily in­volved in the labour market be­cause a free­wheel­ing one will never favour the work­ers’ in­ter­ests, given the un­equal sta­tus and of­ten op­pos­ing in­ter­ests of em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Labour poli­cies that overly favour work­ers will sti­fle new in­vest­ment and prompt com­pa­nies to hire tem­po­rary staff.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers want prof­its, the unions want bet­ter pay and the govern­ment wants a con­ducive in­vest­ment cli­mate. These el­e­ments are not part of a zero-sum game but are in­ter-de­pen­dent, as com­pa­nies can re­main prof­itable only if they take good care of work­ers, and the com­bi­na­tion of the two leads to in­creased com­pet­i­tive­ness that at­tracts in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Hence, eco­nomic growth and job cre­ation go hand in hand in the com­mon in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>If the unions con­tinue to hold strikes and street demon­stra­tions to push their de­mand for higher wages and more gen­er­ous wel­fare ben­e­fits at a time when we are in a coro­n­avirus-in­duced re­ces­sion, then their ac­tion will be en­tirely coun­ter­pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is that wage hikes are not sus­tain­able if rev­enues do not in­crease, whether by in­creased pro­duc­tiv­ity, bet­ter in­fra­struc­ture or higher sales.</p>
    <p>But blam­ing the slow growth in for­mal jobs pri­mar­ily on rigid labour rules could also mis­lead pol­icy de­ci­sions in both the in­for­mal and for­mal sec­tors.</p>
    <p>The key to spurring jobs growth in the for­mal sec­tor is in­vest­ment poli­cies that pro­mote prod­uct di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and fa­cil­i­tate busi­ness re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>To re­it­er­ate, more than 90 per cent of the pro­vi­sions in the job-cre­ation om­nibus law are ap­pro­pri­ately de­signed to stim­u­late pri­vate in­vest­ment and busi­nesses. How­ever, the govern­ment should also re­alise the blunt fact that while the majority of the work­force is cur­rently en­gaged in the ru­ral sec­tor, it is this very sec­tor that pol­i­cy­mak­ers have long ne­glected.</p>
    <p>It is no won­der that the ru­ral sec­tor has the high­est un­der­em­ploy­ment rate and low­est pro­duc­tiv­ity, and will re­main so un­less the govern­ment boosts pub­lic in­vest­ment in ru­ral in­fra­struc­ture and ex­pands the cov­er­age of its agri­cul­tural ex­ten­sion pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The labour-in­ten­sive in­dus­tries would re­main unattrac­tive to in­vestors if the labour rules were not amended to boost the com­pet­i­tive­ness of In­done­sian labour against our South-east Asian neigh­bours.</p>
