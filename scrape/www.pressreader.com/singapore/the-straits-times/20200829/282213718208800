    <p>In the midst of the Covid-19 pan­demic, ques­tions usu­ally asked by im­mu­nol­o­gists study­ing hu­man im­mune re­sponse to viruses are now on every­one’s lips. Peo­ple won­der if they will get very sick should they be in­fected, or how long pro­tec­tion from a vac­cine will last.</p>
    <p>To get some an­swers, im­mu­nol­o­gists have had to reckon with the com­plex­ity of the im­mune re­sponse to viruses.</p>
    <p>On the one hand, viruses in­duce pro­duc­tion of an­ti­bod­ies – Yshaped pro­teins that bind to the sur­face of the virus and thus hin­der virus en­try into cells. If the right an­ti­bod­ies are present in suf­fi­cient amounts be­fore an in­di­vid­ual is ex­posed to a virus – be­cause they are gen­er­ated by vac­ci­na­tion, for in­stance – they may be able to pre­vent vi­ral in­fec­tion al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, vi­ral in­fec­tion also re­sults in the ac­ti­va­tion and ex­pan­sion of im­mune cells called T cells. T cells come in many dif­fer­ent forms, but they have two main func­tions: to recog­nise and kill in­fected cells where the virus is repli­cat­ing, and to boost an­ti­body pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>They ex­ert their func­tions by recog­nis­ing frag­ments of virus pro­teins that are chopped up in­side in­fected cells and then “pre­sented” on the cell sur­face – the in­fected cell is thus sig­nalling to the T cells: “Hi there, I have a virus in­side, please come de­stroy me.”</p>
    <p>T cells may not be able to com­pletely pre­vent virus in­fec­tion from hap­pen­ing, but they can rapidly stub out vi­ral ex­pan­sion in the body and there­fore pre­vent dis­ease. Im­por­tantly, they main­tain the “mem­ory” of a pathogen for decades and will be rapidly re­cruited upon new in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>When the global ef­forts to con­tain Sars-CoV-2 – the virus which causes Covid-19 – started some months ago, the great­est em­pha­sis was placed on de­sign­ing vac­cines able to in­duce an an­ti­body re­sponse against the virus, es­pe­cially against spike pro­teins on its sur­face.</p>
    <p>The im­por­tance of T cells for an­tivi­ral im­mu­nity is not a new con­cept. It has been fun­da­men­tal in the sci­en­tific com­mu­nity for over 50 years, but was ini­tially largely ig­nored in dis­cus­sions re­lated to Covid-19 im­mu­nity and vac­cine devel­op­ment – T cells are harder to study and some clas­si­cal vac­cines, such as the sea­sonal in­fluenza vac­cine, mostly rely on an­ti­body gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>An­ti­bod­ies are cer­tainly im­por­tant in con­tain­ing in­fec­tion, but ques­tions re­main on how longlived they may be af­ter vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>As more stud­ies into the T cell re­sponse to Sars-CoV-2 have emerged, sci­en­tists have be­gun to recog­nise the im­por­tance of T cells in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>We now know that T cells are in­deed in­duced by Sars-CoV-2 in­fec­tion. They are present in 100 per cent of the Covid-19 in­di­vid­u­als that we and oth­ers have tested in our lab­o­ra­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Us­ing dif­fer­ent meth­ods, our lab­o­ra­to­ries have cu­mu­la­tively screened close to 250 in­di­vid­u­als who re­cov­ered from Covid-19. All have Sars-CoV-2-spe­cific T cells.</p>
    <p>Many of th­ese peo­ple, al­though pre­vi­ously in­fected, had not de­vel­oped any symp­toms. Some of th­ese asymp­to­matic in­di­vid­u­als have a very low level of an­ti­bod­ies, yet they have T cells for the virus – a find­ing that sug­gests that the T cells might be very im­por­tant for pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>We have found that apart from the virus’ spike pro­tein, T cells tar­get other struc­tural pro­teins as well as pro­teins nec­es­sary for the virus’ repli­ca­tion. This has po­ten­tial reper­cus­sions on how a vac­cine aimed at in­duc­ing a broad T cell re­sponse should be de­signed.</p>
    <p>Based on how they look and be­have when we an­a­lyse them, we have ev­i­dence that th­ese T cells should be able to do their job – to kill in­fected cells and se­crete fac</p>
    <p>HOW AN­TI­BOD­IES WORK HOW T CELLS WORK</p>
    <p>tors with an­tivi­ral ac­tiv­ity, and boost im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Is the T cell re­sponse against Sars-CoV-2 long-lived? This ques­tion can be di­rectly an­swered only in time.</p>
    <p>To as­sess per­sis­tence or wan­ing of the re­sponse, re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als will need fol­low­ing up for months and years to come.</p>
    <p>But there are grounds for con­fi­dence. In­deed, 23 in­di­vid­u­als who had Sars in 2003 were re­cently all still found to have T cells that recog­nise Sars-CoV-1, which causes Sars, even 17 years af­ter in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>This sug­gests that coro­n­aviruses do in­deed in­duce long-last­ing T cell im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>What is even more in­ter­est­ing is that many of th­ese T cells gen­er­ated by Sars-CoV-1 in­fec­tion were also able to recog­nise Sars-CoV-2 – a phenomenon im­mu­nol­o­gists call “cross-re­ac­tiv­ity”.</p>
    <p>This brings us to a new set of find­ings with po­ten­tially very im­por­tant im­pli­ca­tions: many in­di­vid­u­als who have never been in­fected also have T cells that can tar­get SarsCoV-2.</p>
    <p>To be pre­cise, we have seen SarsCoV-2-spe­cific T cells in more than 50 per cent of un­in­fected healthy in­di­vid­u­als in Sin­ga­pore. Some of th­ese re­sults were pub­lished last month in the jour­nal Na­ture. To date, more than a 100 peo­ple have been tested.</p>
    <p>This ob­ser­va­tion has re­cently been con­firmed by stud­ies in the United States, and is there­fore likely to have global sig­nif­i­cance.</p>
    <p>Th­ese T cells, like the “cross-re­ac­tive” T cells found in re­cov­ered Sars pa­tients, are likely to have been gen­er­ated by ex­po­sure to other coro­n­aviruses – prob­a­bly the com­monly cir­cu­lat­ing coro­n­aviruses that cause colds – which share sim­i­lar­i­ties with Sars-CoV-2 in their pro­tein struc­ture. It may also be pos­si­ble that coro­n­aviruses iden­ti­fied so far only in other an­i­mal species, such as bats, in­duce Sars-CoV-2 T cells in hu­mans, but this will need to be con­firmed.</p>
    <p>Thus, a cer­tain level of pre-ex­ist­ing im­mu­nity against Sars-CoV-2 ap­pears to be present in the gen­eral pop­u­la­tion. It could per­haps ex­plain why some pop­u­la­tions and coun­tries have very lit­tle in­ci­dence of se­vere dis­ease over to­tal in­fected cases.</p>
    <p>Is this pre-ex­ist­ing im­mu­nity use­ful against Covid-19? Does it af­ford pro­tec­tion from dis­ease? Does it dampen symp­toms? Are in­di­vid­u­als with cross-re­ac­tive T cell im­mu­nity more likely to be asymp­to­matic? Is the ex­tent of this pre-ex­ist­ing im­mu­nity af­fect­ing dis­ease sever­ity or mor­tal­ity rates in pop­u­la­tions where th­ese rates are very low, such as Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>An af­fir­ma­tive an­swer to th­ese ques­tions is not un­rea­son­able but, for now, com­pletely spec­u­la­tive.</p>
    <p>Tack­ling this will re­quire screen­ing un­ex­posed in­di­vid­u­als for the pres­ence or ab­sence of pre-ex­ist­ing T cells against Sars-CoV-2, and then fol­low­ing up with th­ese in­di­vid­u­als to record the sever­ity of their dis­ease if they get ex­posed to the virus.</p>
    <p>Such a study is not easy to con­duct as it re­quires re­cruit­ment and long-term fol­low­ing up of large numbers of un­in­fected in­di­vid­u­als, the ma­jor­ity of whom are not likely to get in­fected.</p>
    <p>But there is rea­son to be hope­ful. More and more stud­ies are show­ing that a healthy T cell re­sponse gen­er­ated dur­ing nat­u­ral in­fec­tion with Sars-CoV-2 is likely to per­sist for years, and that T cells may play a role in pro­tect­ing in­di­vid­u­als from se­vere dis­ease.</p>
    <p>As ef­forts to de­velop ef­fec­tive and safe vac­cines progress world­wide, we have also seen a re­newed in­ter­est in un­der­stand­ing the ex­tent to which cur­rent vac­cines are able to gen­er­ate T cell – and not only an­ti­body – re­sponses, and we are work­ing along­side vac­cine com­pa­nies to help guide vac­cine devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>How an­ti­bod­ies and T cells work against coro­n­aviruses</p>
    <p>Apart from the virus’ spike pro­tein, T cells tar­get other struc­tural pro­teins as well as pro­teins nec­es­sary for the virus’ repli­ca­tion. This has po­ten­tial reper­cus­sions on how a vac­cine aimed at in­duc­ing a broad T cell re­sponse should be de­signed.</p>
    <p>Based on how they look and be­have when we an­a­lyse them, we have ev­i­dence that th­ese T cells should be able to do their job – to kill in­fected cells and se­crete fac­tors with an­tivi­ral ac­tiv­ity, and boost im­mune re­sponse.</p>
