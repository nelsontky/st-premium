    <p>China has seen more than a hun­dred cases of Covid-19 in the com­mu­nity in just over a month, with clus­ters recorded across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>This is a far cry from re­cent months when home-grown cases were few and far be­tween.</p>
    <p>Yet, de­spite of­fi­cials ad­mit­ting that China’s man­age­ment of the Covid-19 pan­demic is com­ing un­der in­creas­ing pres­sure, Bei­jing has held off on im­ple­ment­ing tougher re­stric­tions across the coun­try, a clear sign that it is con­fi­dent in con­tain­ing and con­trol­ling the spread of coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Un­like the se­cond and third waves in the United States and Europe, where hos­pi­tals are pushed al­most to break­ing point, China has so far man­aged to keep re­cent in­fec­tion clus­ters – in Shang­hai, Tian­jin, In­ner Mon­go­lia and Xin­jiang – con­tained.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese ex­perts and ob­servers at­tribute this to the coun­try’s proven sys­tem of widespread test­ing, trac­ing con­tacts and iso­lat­ing them , as well as its tiered sys­tem of epi­demic risk lev­els, which lim­its move­ment of peo­ple from high risk ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has also been boost­ing its ca­pa­bil­i­ties to track and trace in­fec­tions this win­ter sea­son – train­ing close to three mil­lion per­son­nel and set­ting up more than 7,000 fever clin­ics in fir­stand se­cond-tier cities across the coun­try, the health au­thor­i­ties re­vealed on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The ap­proach to con­tain­ment has evolved to be­ing more tar­geted.</p>
    <p>In re­mote ar­eas like Kash­gar in Xin­jiang and Manzhouli in In­ner Mon­go­lia, where con­tact trac­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties might not be as de­vel­oped as in ur­ban ar­eas, the de­tec­tion of clus­ters has trig­gered widespread test­ing.</p>
    <p>In Kash­gar, a 17-year-old girl picked up as be­ing pos­i­tive dur­ing rou­tine test­ing in late Oc­to­ber trig­gered mass city-wide test­ing, Chi­nese me­dia re­ported. The state-run Global Times re­ported last month that four rounds of nu­cleic acid test­ing had been car­ried out in the city of 4.7 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion was re­ported in Manzhouli in In­ner Mon­go­lia. The city of over 200,000 peo­ple, lo­cated near the Rus­sian bor­der, is cur­rently un­der­go­ing its third round of mass test­ing af­ter cases were de­tected late last month.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, in­fec­tions in ur­ban cen­tres such as Shang­hai and Tian­jin have led to more tar­geted test­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>In Shang­hai, the au­thor­i­ties tested per­son­nel work­ing at Pudong air­port, a lo­cal hos­pi­tal and higher risk neigh­bour­hoods, while Tian­jin fo­cused mainly on res­i­dents in the Bin­hai New district, where con­firmed cases were ini­tially dis­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>State-run Bei­jing Youth Daily ran a com­men­tary last week say­ing that the pub­lic should be cau­tious but not overly wor­ried about the re­cent spate of cases. “Anti-epi­demic de­part­ments re­spond quickly and with strong ac­tion, and can build a tight line of de­fence in the short­est time. On the other hand, there is a high de­gree of co­op­er­a­tion from the pub­lic who ac­tively re­spond to ap­peals from the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties,” it said.</p>
    <p>China’s sys­tem of epi­demic con­trol has been crit­i­cised by Western coun­tries for be­ing dra­co­nian but of­fi­cials in­sist that it is nec­es­sary to keep a lid on in­fec­tions. Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion for Dis­ease Con­trol deputy direc­tor Wu Liangyou said in a press brief­ing on Thurs­day that in­fec­tion rates were ris­ing rapidly overseas and that China faced a greater risk of im­ported cases. “It is ex­pected that the epi­demic will con­tinue to be spo­radic in na­ture this win­ter sea­son, with clus­ters pos­si­ble in some ar­eas,” he said, urg­ing lo­cal gov­ern­ments to “res­o­lutely plug loop­holes”.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are now fo­cus­ing on im­ported frozen foods and cold chain lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>A test­ing reg­i­men has been put in place for work­ers han­dling such prod­ucts and dis­in­fec­tion re­quire­ments be­fore these prod­ucts hit the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The Global Times noted in a re­port last week that at least 16 pro­vin­cial-level ar­eas have de­tected Covid-19 on the pack­ag­ing of im­ported frozen food.</p>
    <p>In one case this week, 55 peo­ple in Zhe­jiang prov­ince were quar­an­tined af­ter sam­ples of frozen pork from Brazil tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>The goal is to reach zero</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases and un­til a vac­cine is widely avail­able, China will likely con­tinue with what has worked – a strat­egy that it has de­scribed as a “fire ex­tin­guisher ap­proach”.</p>
    <p>It is qui­etly con­fi­dent it will work. “Com­pared to the early days of the epi­demic when there was a short­age of med­i­cal sup­plies and man­age­ment of the sit­u­a­tion was poor, to­day we have ac­cu­mu­lated rich ex­pe­ri­ences in fight­ing the epi­demic,” said the Bei­jing Youth Daily.</p>
    <p>Un­like the se­cond and third waves in the United States and Europe, where hos­pi­tals are pushed al­most to break­ing point, China has so far man­aged to keep re­cent in­fec­tion clus­ters – in Shang­hai, Tian­jin, In­ner Mon­go­lia and Xin­jiang – con­tained.</p>
