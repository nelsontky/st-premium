    <p>Time mag­a­zine has in­cluded a book by a Sin­ga­porean au­thor, Neon Yang’s (be­low) 2017 novella The Black Tides Of Heaven, on its list of The 100 Best Fan­tasy Books Of All Time. The list, which was pub­lished last Thurs­day, ranges from the 9th cen­tury to the present day.</p>
    <p>Time mag­a­zine has in­cluded a book by a Sin­ga­porean au­thor, Neon Yang’s 2017 novella The Black Tides Of Heaven, on its list of The 100 Best Fan­tasy Books Of All Time.</p>
    <p>The list, which was pub­lished last Thurs­day, ranges from the 9th cen­tury to the present day. It was based off nom­i­na­tions by a panel of cel­e­brated fan­tasy au­thors in­clud­ing Neil Gaiman, Mar­lon James, N.K. Jemisin and Ge­orge R.R. Martin.</p>
    <p>Pan­el­lists did not nom­i­nate their own works. On the list are C.S. Lewis’ 1950 chil­dren’s clas­sic The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe; Jin Yong’s Chi­nese mar­tial arts epic Leg­ends Of The Con­dor He­roes (rep­re­sented by A Hero Born, the 2018 English trans­la­tion of its first vol­ume); and Tomi Adeyemi’s West African-in­spired young adult novel Chil­dren Of Blood And Bone (2018).</p>
    <p>The Black Tides Of Heaven opens the Ten­so­rate quar­tet of novel­las, which were pub­lished un­der the name JY Yang.</p>
    <p>Set in a South-east Asian-in­flu­enced fan­tasy world, it fol­lows twins Mokoya and Akeha, who are born to the pow­er­ful Pro­tec­tor of the king­dom.</p>
    <p>Mokoya has vi­sions of the fu­ture while Akeha has the gift, or “slack­craft”, to ma­nip­u­late el­e­ments in the nat­u­ral world.</p>
    <p>In 2018, it was a Best Novella fi­nal­ist for both the pres­ti­gious Hugo and Ne­bula awards, mak­ing Yang one of the first Sin­ga­pore­ans to be short­listed for both awards.</p>
    <p>Yang wel­comed the di­ver­sity of the Time list and its at­tempt to re­de­fine the lit­er­ary canon.</p>
    <p>“I think we’re be­gin­ning to move away from tra­di­tional ideas of who can suc­ceed as a fan­tasy writer,” said the 37-year-old. “The Black Tides Of Heaven was a deeply per­sonal book for me, en­cap­su­lat­ing a lot of my feel­ings about gen­der and de­fy­ing the ex­pec­ta­tions that our el­ders place upon us.</p>
    <p>“To have it named on a list of the great­est fan­tasy books of all time, which in­cludes books I grew up with and books that in­spired me to be­come a writer in the first place – it means more than I could pos­si­bly say.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Yang scored a six-fig­ure book deal with pub­lisher Tor Books for a new space opera tril­ogy, The Nul­lvoid Chron­i­cles.</p>
    <p>The first novel, The Gen­e­sis Of Misery, is planned for publi­ca­tion in 2022.</p>
    <p>Yang de­scribed it as “Joan of Arc (the 15th-cen­tury French saint who led an army af­ter hav­ing vi­sions of an­gels) with gi­ant ro­bots”.</p>
    <p>“The Gen­e­sis Of Misery has been an im­mense labour for me. I’ve rewrit­ten it from scratch sev­eral times and I am still rewrit­ing it as we speak, ac­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>“It’s the first time I’ve writ­ten any­thing of this length and scope and there’s def­i­nitely been a learn­ing curve. I’m go­ing for some­thing a bit more on the fun side this time, some­thing that en­ter­tains as well as pro­vokes.”</p>
