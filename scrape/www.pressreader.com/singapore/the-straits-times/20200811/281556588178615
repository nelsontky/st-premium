    <p>An­thol­ogy se­ries Room 104 has a low bud­get and is set in a sin­gle mo­tel room. But it has found favour with critics, fans and ac­tors such as Guardians Of The Galaxy star</p>
    <p>Dave Bautista, who was paid next to noth­ing for his ap­pear­ance this sea­son.</p>
    <p>In con­trast to flashy re­boots of iconic an­thol­ogy se­ries such as Net­flix’s Black Mirror re­vival in 2016 or the new The Twi­light Zone last year, Room 104 has had a stead­fastly low-key, indie vibe.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause of the pedi­gree of cre­ators Mark and Jay Du­plass – the ac­tor, writer and pro­ducer sib­lings be­hind nat­u­ral­is­tic com­edy-dra­mas such as indie films The Puffy Chair (2005) and Bag­head (2008), and the se­ries To­geth­er­ness (2015 to 2016).</p>
    <p>The Du­plasses took the un­usual step of vow­ing that their an­thol­ogy – launched in 2017 and now air­ing its fourth and fi­nal sea­son on HBO Go and at 11am and 11pm on Satur­days on Cine­max (StarHub TV Chan­nel 611) – would be made cheaply.</p>
    <p>And all its sto­ries – writ­ten, pro­duced and di­rected by them and oth­ers – would have to be set in a sin­gle mo­tel room.</p>
    <p>Yet, these stan­dalone tales, which run the gamut from hor­ror and science-fic­tion to com­edy and ro­mance, have con­sis­tently found favour with critics and fans.</p>
    <p>And they have even at­tracted a few well-known ac­tors such as Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014 to 2017) star Dave Bautista, who was paid next to noth­ing for his ap­pear­ance this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Chat­ting to re­porters by video call re­cently from his Los An­ge­les home, Mark Du­plass, 43, says the pro­duc­tion team has of­ten been tempted to go over bud­get or let the story stray from the con­fines of the room.</p>
    <p>“You would laugh if you over­heard us try­ing to jus­tify to our­selves why an episode we re­ally want to make doesn’t break the rules,” says Du­plass, who starred in To­geth­er­ness and ap­pears in an episode of Room 104 for the first time this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“One time, we even went so far as say­ing, ‘This episode idea would be so cool. What if it’s just a movie some­one’s watch­ing on their lap­top in the room and we just show the movie on the lap­top?’</p>
    <p>“We’ve tried ev­ery­thing,” he says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>The show con­tin­ued to rein­vent it­self for Sea­son 4, film­ing its first an­i­mated episode as well as one shot in the style of an old-school Amer­i­can sit­com, laugh track in­cluded.</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­ers had longed to film a story in­volv­ing a were­wolf, but the spe­cial ef­fects would have cost a bomb, so they did it us­ing an­i­ma­tion in­stead – a process that took five la­bo­ri­ous months, but al­lowed them to scratch that were­wolf itch for very lit­tle money.</p>
    <p>An­other clever way of keep­ing costs down: The Du­plasses and their team have tapped their vast net­work of con­nec­tions in Hol­ly­wood, which in­cludes ac­tors such as Bautista, who stars in an episode about a re­tired pro­fes­sional wrestler bat­tling demons from his past.</p>
    <p>Those who know Bautista from his su­per­hero films or pro-wrestling days are in for a sur­prise, Du­plass says. “The depth, heart­break and sub­tlety he brought to his episode were a rev­e­la­tion for me.</p>
    <p>“And he’s a huge movie star mak­ing about five dol­lars work­ing on our show, and he was so nice and ap­pre­cia­tive the whole time.”</p>
    <p>Look­ing back on the se­ries, Du­plass says the best thing about it was the cre­ative col­lab­o­ra­tion with emerg­ing writ­ers, direc­tors and ac­tors, some of whom got their big break on the show.</p>
    <p>“It started out as a fun way to ex­press dif­fer­ent sides of my­self cre­atively. Then I re­alised the bet­ter ver­sion of the show was if I used what­ever film-mak­ing skills and plat­form I have to sup­port other artists – giv­ing them a space to make their first story, get their first big di­rect­ing credit or their first star­ring role.</p>
    <p>“That has been such a won­der­ful, mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial thing, not only for telling dif­fer­ent kinds of sto­ries, but also keep­ing us fresh and keep­ing me young and ex­cited be­ing around their en­ergy,” he says.</p>
    <p>Du­plass is happy that Room 104 has been a launch pad for new tal­ent. “It’s al­most been like its own lit­tle film fes­ti­val where peo­ple come and make a short film and then break out and do their thing from there.”</p>
