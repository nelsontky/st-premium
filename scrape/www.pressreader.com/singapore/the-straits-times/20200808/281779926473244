    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials have urged the Pres­i­dent to delist Chi­nese com­pa­nies that trade on US ex­changes and fail to meet US au­dit­ing re­quire­ments by Jan­uary 2022, Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion (SEC) and Trea­sury of­fi­cials have said.</p>
    <p>The re­marks came af­ter Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump tasked a group of key ad­vis­ers, in­clud­ing Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steve Mnuchin and SEC chair­man Jay Clayton, with draft­ing a re­port with rec­om­men­da­tions to pro­tect US in­vestors from Chi­nese com­pa­nies whose au­dit doc­u­ments have long been kept from United States reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>It also comes amid grow­ing pres­sure from Congress to crack down on Chi­nese com­pa­nies that avail them­selves of US cap­i­tal mar­kets but do not com­ply with US rules faced by Amer­i­can ri­vals.</p>
    <p>“We are sim­ply lev­el­ling the play­ing field, hold­ing Chi­nese firms listed in the US to the same stan­dards as ev­ery­one else,” a Trea­sury of­fi­cial told re­porters in a brief­ing call about the re­port on Thursday.</p>
    <p>The US Se­nate unan­i­mously passed leg­is­la­tion in May that could pre­vent some Chi­nese com­pa­nies from list­ing their shares on US ex­changes un­less they fol­low stan­dards for US au­dits and reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Sen­a­tor Chris Van Hollen, who spon­sored the Bill, de­scribed the rec­om­men­da­tions as “an im­por­tant first step”, but said that “without the added teeth of our Bill, this re­port alone does not im­ple­ment the re­quire­ments nec­es­sary to pro­tect ev­ery­day Amer­i­can in­vestors”.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion’s rec­om­men­da­tions, if im­ple­mented via an SEC rule-mak­ing process, would give Chi­nese com­pa­nies al­ready listed in the US un­til Jan 1, 2022, to en­sure the US au­dit­ing watch­dog, known as the PCAOB, has ac­cess to their au­dit doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>They can also pro­vide a “co-au­dit”, for ex­am­ple, per­formed by a US par­ent com­pany of the Chin­abased af­fil­i­ate tasked with au­dit­ing the Chi­nese firm. How­ever, com­pa­nies seek­ing to list in the US for the first time will need to com­ply im­me­di­ately, the of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>A State Depart­ment of­fi­cial told Reuters the ad­min­is­tra­tion plans soon to scrap a 2013 agree­ment be­tween the Amer­i­can and Chi­nese au­dit­ing au­thor­i­ties to set up a process for the PCAOB to seek doc­u­ments in en­force­ment cases against Chi­nese au­di­tors.</p>
    <p>China said yes­ter­day that the two coun­tries have “good co­op­er­a­tion” in mon­i­tor­ing pub­licly listed firms.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent sit­u­a­tion is that some US mon­i­tor­ing au­thor­i­ties are fail­ing to com­ply with their obli­ga­tions, and what they are do­ing is po­lit­i­cal ma­nip­u­la­tion – they are try­ing to force Chi­nese com­pa­nies to delist from US mar­kets,” for­eign min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin told a me­dia brief­ing.</p>
