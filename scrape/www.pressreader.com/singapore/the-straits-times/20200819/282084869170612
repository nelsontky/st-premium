    <p>Alone at home, a three-year-old boy climbed through a win­dow of a Hous­ing Board flat onto a nearby air-con­di­tioner ledge and fell from the sev­enth-storey unit.</p>
    <p>That was the likely sce­nario that led to his death in Fe­bru­ary, said State Coroner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam, in rul­ing the case a tragic mis­ad­ven­ture.</p>
    <p>In find­ings up­loaded on­line yes­ter­day, she said the boy was alone at home and that there is no ba­sis to suspect foul play.</p>
    <p>The boy lived with his grand­par­ents at the flat in Block 332 Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 1.</p>
    <p>On the morn­ing of Feb 18, the boy’s grand­mother tried to wake him so that she could take him to her work­place, a cof­fee shop lo­cated in the same block.</p>
    <p>The grand­mother usu­ally did so when her hus­band was not home, said State Coroner Ka­mala. The boy’s grand­fa­ther was in In­done­sia for work that day.</p>
    <p>As the boy was fast asleep, his grand­mother de­cided to let him rest and left the unit at about 5.30am.</p>
    <p>State Coroner Ka­mala said that the child had likely wo­ken up to find him­self alone at home, and the flat would have been dark at that time.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing fear­ful of the dark, he must have de­cided to go in search of his grand­mother,” she said.</p>
    <p>“He had likely put on his slip­pers, stepped onto the bed to open the win­dow which had no grilles in­stalled, and then climbed through the open win­dow and onto the air-con­di­tioner ledge, be­fore fall­ing from height,” the coroner added.</p>
    <p>The boy was pro­nounced dead at 7.07am by at­tend­ing paramedics.</p>
    <p>“Young chil­dren are known to be im­pul­sive and un­pre­dictable. They lack the cog­ni­tive ma­tu­rity to ap­pre­ci­ate the con­se­quences of their ac­tions,” the coroner said. “As a rule, a young child should not be left alone at home.”</p>
    <p>State Coroner Ka­mala Pon­nam­palam said the boy was alone at home and that there is no ba­sis to suspect foul play.</p>
