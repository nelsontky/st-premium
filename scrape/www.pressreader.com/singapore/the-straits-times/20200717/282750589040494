    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Gigi Hadid has been coy about her preg­nancy, but the 25-year-old model fi­nally broke her si­lence in an In­sta­gram Live ses­sion on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Flaunt­ing her baby bump, the mum-to-be, who is ex­pected to de­liver in Septem­ber, took the op­por­tu­nity to pro­mote Gigi Jour­nal Part II, a cu­ra­tion of art and writ­ing in col­lab­o­ra­tion with V Mag­a­zine, along with ad­dress­ing ques­tions about her preg­nancy.</p>
    <p>Ex­press­ing her gratitude for the pos­i­tive com­ments, she said: “I’m so grate­ful for… the ques­tions and want­ing you just to know that we’re all good and safe and ev­ery­thing’s go­ing great.”</p>
    <p>News of the preg­nancy – Hadid’s first – leaked in April. The baby’s fa­ther is singer Zayn Ma­lik.</p>
    <p>The model added that her si­lence stemmed from the cir­cum­stances: “I’m preg­nant through a pan­demic. Like ob­vi­ously, my preg­nancy is not the most im­por­tant thing go­ing on in the world.”</p>
    <p>She added that so­cial me­dia should be fo­cused on more im­por­tant mat­ters, in­clud­ing the coro­n­avirus, as well as the “re-emer­gence of the BLM (Black Lives Mat­ter) move­ment”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she added that she has been dili­gently doc­u­ment­ing her jour­ney, tak­ing pic­tures of her bump for friends and fam­ily.</p>
    <p>She teased that she would be shar­ing con­tent with fans: “You guys will see it when you see it. I’m get­ting cute stuff.”</p>
