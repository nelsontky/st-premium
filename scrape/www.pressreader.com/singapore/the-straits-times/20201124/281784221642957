    <p>The joint de­ci­sion by Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong to de­fer the air travel bub­ble was based on “clear pa­ram­e­ters” that had been set out in the agree­ment be­tween the two cities, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The travel bub­ble had been slated to start on Sun­day, but its de­lay was an­nounced a day ear­lier in the light of a re­cent spike in coro­n­avirus cases in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing ques­tions on the travel bub­ble dur­ing a press con­fer­ence where Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic fig­ures for the third quar­ter were re­leased, Mr Chan said that the terms had been laid out dur­ing ear­lier dis­cus­sions be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Both sides made “a very fast agree­ment that when the con­di­tions are changed, when the con­di­tions have evolved, we will take the de­ci­sions ac­cord­ingly”, he added.</p>
    <p>Un­der the agree­ment, the travel bub­ble would be sus­pended with a two-day no­tice if the seven-day mov­ing av­er­age for un­linked cases in either city ex­ceeds five.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said both cities’ au­thor­i­ties present the other with daily up­dates on their Covid-19 num­bers.</p>
    <p>A joint de­ci­sion is made when the thresh­old is breached, he said, adding: “As and when there is new in­for­ma­tion avail­able (from) both sides, we will share with each other, and once we look at those num­bers, we ap­ply the frame­work and we make a joint de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>The Civil Avi­a­tion Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore said last Saturday morn­ing that the travel bub­ble would pro­ceed as planned the next day, but with the added re­quire­ment for trav­ellers from Hong Kong to take a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test upon ar­rival.</p>
    <p>Later in the day, how­ever, the Uturn on the de­ci­sion and the de­fer­ment of the travel bub­ble for two weeks was an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said in a Face­book post last Saturday af­ter­noon that up­dates on when the travel bub­ble can be­gin will be made at a later date.</p>
