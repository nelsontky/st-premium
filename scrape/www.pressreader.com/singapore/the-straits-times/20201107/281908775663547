    <p>A new five-tier so­cial dis­tanc­ing pol­icy in South Korea means Sin­ga­porean Deb­o­rah Cheok will be able to watch Dis­ney film Mu­lan in the cin­ema with her Korean hus­band with­out an empty seat be­tween them as man­dated pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>But she is hes­i­tant to do so, wary of go­ing to public places with poor ven­ti­la­tion, such as movie halls, while Covid-19 is still spread­ing.</p>
    <p>South Korea has seen around 100 new cases a day since so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules were eased to the low­est Level 1 from Oct 12.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, 145 cases were re­ported, bring­ing the to­tal to 27,195. The death toll stood at 476.</p>
    <p>A stricter and more spe­cific so­cial dis­tanc­ing sys­tem that will go into ef­fect to­day aims to “im­prove ef­fec­tive­ness and ad­her­ence to anti-virus rules”, Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun said when he an­nounced the mea­sure last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>It re­places the three-tier sys­tem which has been in ef­fect since the end of June. The new mea­sure com­prises five lev­els: 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3.</p>
    <p>The coun­try will also be di­vided into seven zones to give the lo­cal au­thor­i­ties more con­trol over Covid-19 within their ar­eas. This in­cludes the Seoul cap­i­tal area (Seoul, In­cheon and Gyeonggi prov­ince), Chungcheon­g, Honam, North</p>
    <p>Gyeongsang, South Gyeongsang, Gang­won and Jeju is­land.</p>
    <p>The re­vised rules are also aimed at min­imis­ing the pan­demic’s im­pact on daily lives and busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties, the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion Agency said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The change comes as con­cern is ris­ing about the grow­ing num­ber of spo­radic clus­ters of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In Seoul alone, 42 cases were traced to a sauna, 11 to a bro­ker­age house, and seven to the fu­neral of Sam­sung chair­man Lee Kun-hee at Sam­sung Med­i­cal Cen­tre last week.</p>
    <p>A re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion fa­cil­ity in Gwangju in Gyeonggi saw 106 cases, and a call cen­tre in Cheo­nan in South Chungcheon­g saw at least 21.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties ad­mit­ted the in­fec­tion was “spread­ing faster than con­tact trac­ing”, and that sur­veil­lance and con­tain­ment had be­come in­creas­ingly chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>They urged against so­cial­is­ing and gath­er­ing in­doors, adding that it was cru­cial to com­ply with pre­ven­tive mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The five-tier so­cial dis­tanc­ing sys­tem has drawn some crit­i­cism.</p>
    <p>Of­fice worker Lee So-ra, 26, thinks it is aimed only at “re­duc­ing dis­sat­is­fac­tion with the gov­ern­ment’s con­trol of the out­break by ac­cept­ing some peo­ple’s com­plaints”. She told The Straits Times: “I don’t think it will be more ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing the spread of the virus.”</p>
    <p>Job seeker Lee Hyun-a, 25, thinks there is “no big dif­fer­ence” be­tween the new and old sys­tems.</p>
    <p>“It’s just dif­fer­ent frames and can cause con­fu­sion,” she said. “We have ex­cel­lent quar­an­tine mea­sures but I am also wor­ried we can lose con­trol. The econ­omy is im­por­tant, but the crack­down on so­cial dis­tanc­ing must be strength­ened to pro­tect public safety.”</p>
    <p>As for Ms Cheok, life will re­main the same what­ever the rules.</p>
    <p>“Re­gard­less of how many tiers they have for so­cial dis­tanc­ing, we will still avoid public places with poor ven­ti­la­tion like cin­e­mas, wear a mask ev­ery­where we go, and drive rather than take public trans­port,” said the house­wife, 29.</p>
    <p>“Now that we are en­ter­ing win­ter, I’m scared to catch even a nor­mal flu, not to men­tion Covid-19.”</p>
