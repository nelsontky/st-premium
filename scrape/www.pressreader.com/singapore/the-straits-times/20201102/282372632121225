    <p>BEIJING • Huawei Tech­nolo­gies plans to build a chip plant in Shang­hai with­out us­ing Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy, as China’s big­gest tech com­pany in terms of sales seeks a new strat­egy to over­come in­creas­ingly tight US sanc­tions, the Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported.</p>
    <p>The fabri­ca­tion fa­cil­ity is ex­pected to start with the man­u­fac­ture of l ow-end 45 nanome­ter (nm) chips, the pa­per said yes­ter­day, cit­ing peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the pro­ject. Huawei aims to make 28nm chips for In­ter­net of Things de­vices by the end of next year, and pro­duce 20nm chips for 5G telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment by late-2022, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>Huawei, the world’s largest tele­coms equip­ment maker, has no ex­pe­ri­ence in fab­ri­cat­ing chips.</p>
    <p>The plant would be run by Shang­hai IC R&D Cen­tre, a re­search com­pany backed by the city’s gov­ern­ment, ac­cord­ing to the re­port.</p>
    <p>China has laid out a path towards greater eco­nomic self-suf­fi­ciency in its new five-year plans and vowed to build its own core tech­nolo­gies, say­ing it can­not rely on buy­ing them from else­where. One core area is semi­con­duc­tors, where China lags be­hind lead­ing pro­duc­ers in­clud­ing the United States, South Korea and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Beijing’s aim is to in­crease the share of Chi­nese-made chips from the cur­rent 25 per cent to 70 per cent in five years.</p>
    <p>While the US con­trols tech­nolo­gies for high-pre­ci­sion chips, China has the ca­pa­bil­ity and ca­pac­ity to in­crease its pro­duc­tion of low-pre­ci­sion chips. In fact, the bulk of in­dus­trial de­mand is for low-pre­ci­sion chips – those of 40nm or above ac­count for nearly 80 per cent of the to­tal de­mand for chips.</p>
    <p>Huawei has emerged as a fo­cal point in de­te­ri­o­rat­ing US-China re­la­tions, with US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion al­leg­ing that its equip­ment could be used by Beijing for spy­ing – a claim the com­pany has re­peat­edly de­nied.</p>
    <p>When es­ca­lat­ing US re­stric­tions cut off Huawei’s sup­plies of many over­seas chips, it re­sponded by build­ing up stakes in Chi­nese semi­con­duc­tor com­pa­nies and other tech busi­nesses to bol­ster its sup­ply chain. An in­vest­ment arm set up by Huawei in April last year has closed 17 deals for stakes in Chi­nese tech com­pa­nies since Au­gust last year, records as of end-Septem­ber show.</p>
    <p>But while the in­vest­ments might help Huawei in the fu­ture, an­a­lysts say they have done lit­tle so far to ad­dress the sup­ply chain gaps that are un­der­min­ing its once-boom­ing smart­phone busi­ness and could even­tu­ally threaten its core net­work equip­ment op­er­a­tions. Many of the busi­nesses Huawei has backed are also at an early stage in their devel­op­ment.</p>
