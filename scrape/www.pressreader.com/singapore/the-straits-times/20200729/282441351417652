    <p>Huawei’s Sound X is a wire­less speaker that the Chi­nese tech gi­ant co-de­signed with French pre­mium au­dio com­pany De­vialet.</p>
    <p>De­vialet is famed for its su­perb but ex­pen­sive Phantom se­ries of speak­ers, with prices start­ing at $1,890. Au­dio­philes must have been rubbing their hands in glee when they heard about the Sound X, which goes for $498.</p>
    <p>In terms of de­sign, the Sound X looks like an amal­ga­ma­tion of Ap­ple’s 2013 cylin­dri­cal Mac Pro and its smart speaker HomePod. This is a com­pli­ment: I love the Sound X’s min­i­mal­ist, all-black de­sign.</p>
    <p>The top two-thirds of the speaker have a glossy fin­ish, while the bot­tom third is fin­ished with a mesh grille. But, while nice to look at, the glossy sur­face is a smudge and fin­ger­print mag­net, hence the in­cluded mi­crofi­bre cloth for keep­ing it clean.</p>
    <p>On the speaker’s top is a cir­cu­lar con­trol panel with four touch­sen­si­tive icons – for vol­ume up, vol­ume down, mute and multi-func­tion. Colour in­di­ca­tors sur­round this con­trol panel when the speaker is switched on. To mute it, cover the con­trol panel with your palm.</p>
    <p>The Sound X has two par­tially ex­posed 3.5-inch sub-woofers and six full-range tweet­ers, driven by a com­bined power out­put of 144W.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, the speaker fea­tures De­vialet’s patented sig­nal­pro­cess­ing Speaker Ac­tive Match­ing (SAM) tech­nol­ogy, said to achieve per­fect tem­po­ral align­ment between the recorded sig­nals and the acous­tic pres­sure gen­er­ated by a prod­uct’s loud­speak­ers.</p>
    <p>In other words, you should be hear­ing the au­dio ex­actly how it was recorded, in­stead of with the pos­si­ble minute de­lays caused by most bass di­aphragms.</p>
    <p>Apart from a power port at its base, the speaker has no ports or ca­ble con­nec­tiv­ity to ex­ter­nal de­vices. So it might not be ideal for au­dio purists who want the pris­tine, lag-free au­dio qual­ity of a wired con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>In­stead, it only works wire­lessly with mo­bile de­vices via Blue­tooth or Wi-Fi. It also sup­ports apps with the UPnP au­dio cast­ing pro­to­col. How­ever, the pop­u­lar Google Cast and Ap­ple AirPlay stream­ing op­tions are not sup­ported.</p>
    <p>As you might ex­pect, the Sound X plays best with Huawei smart­phones with the Huawei Share Au­dio fea­ture. This is es­pe­cially if you have a Huawei smart­phone run­ning EMUI 10, such as the lat­est P40 Pro.</p>
    <p>With that com­bi­na­tion, one nicety you get is a seam­less, Ap­ple­like pair­ing ex­pe­ri­ence. Just place your Huawei smart­phone’s rear on the Near Field Com­mu­ni­ca­tion (NFC) icon near the top of the speaker, wait for the Sound X win­dow to ap­pear, and tap it for in­stant pair­ing and to play mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Once paired, you can use Huawei’s AI Life app (An­droid only) to man­age the speaker’s Blue­tooth op­tions, such as mak­ing it dis­cov­er­able, en­abling au­dio cast and up­dat­ing the speaker’s firmware. How­ever, the app has no equaliser set­ting to ad­just the sound.</p>
    <p>While Huawei Share Au­dio sup­ports other smart­phones run­ning An­droid 5.1.1 and later, you do not get a seam­less pair­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, when I tried pair­ing the Sound X with a Sam­sung Galaxy Note10+ via NFC, it started the pair­ing process, but I had to go to Set­tings, open the Blue­tooth menu and tap the Sound X op­tion to pair.</p>
    <p>For the iPhone, you have to man­u­ally make the Sound X dis­cov­er­able by press­ing and holding the mul­ti­func­tion but­ton un­til you hear a tone from the speaker. Then, go to Blue­tooth set­tings and se­lect the speaker.</p>
    <p>All the de­vices I used streamed mu­sic seam­lessly once the pair­ing was se­cured, with no drops or lags.</p>
    <p>Au­dio qual­ity is su­perb. I can read­ily pick out the dif­fer­ent in­stru­ments of a track; the highs are sparkling and de­tailed, the mids and vo­cals were sharp and clear, and the bass res­onates smoothly in my room. The sound is never in dan­ger of break­ing up even at max­i­mum vol­ume.</p>
    <p>On the down­side, the Sound X is not a smart speaker like the Ap­ple HomePod or the Google Home, so you can­not ask it to read out the weather or your ap­point­ments for the day.</p>
