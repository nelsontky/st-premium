    <p>Mus­lim fam­i­lies in Sri Lanka are re­fus­ing to col­lect the bod­ies of their rel­a­tives who died of Covid-19, in protest against the gov­ern­ment en­forc­ing cre­ma­tions.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment health of­fi­cer in the cap­i­tal Colombo told The Straits Times that in the past 10 days, 19 bod­ies have been left un­claimed in the city’s morgue as Mus­lim fam­i­lies de­mand the right to bury their rel­a­tives ac­cord­ing to Is­lamic rites.</p>
    <p>The Sri Lankan gov­ern­ment is­sued a gazette no­ti­fi­ca­tion in April man­dat­ing cre­ma­tion as the only method of dis­posal for all Covid-19re­lated deaths.</p>
    <p>The new rule set off con­cerns among the coun­try’s Mus­lims, who make up 10 per cent of Sri Lanka’s pop­u­la­tion of 21 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>When Mr Mo­hamed’s 70-yearold fa­ther died in his sleep on Nov 29 in their Colombo home, the 28-year-old rib­bon trader said prayers with his mother and rushed his fa­ther’s body to the hospi­tal. Tests found that the man had died with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>For the past 10 days, as the fam­ily has re­fused to pay for the cof­fin and cre­ma­tion, the body has re­mained in the morgue.</p>
    <p>Now in an army-run quar­an­tine cen­tre in the eastern town of Trin­co­ma­lee, Mr Mo­hamed, who gave only his first name for fear of reprisal, said: “It pains me to leave my fa­ther’s body like this, but what can I do? In Is­lam, we be­lieve that a per­son goes to hell if not prop­erly buried.”</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s March guide­lines say vic­tims of Covid-19 “can be buried or cre­mated”.</p>
    <p>But the gov­ern­ment’s chief epi­demi­ol­o­gist Su­gath Sa­ma­raweera told the me­dia an ex­pert com­mit­tee had warned them about Sri Lanka’s high wa­ter ta­ble, and that buri­als could con­tam­i­nate ground wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Twelve pe­ti­tions from civil or­gan­i­sa­tions and Mus­lim and Catholic fam­i­lies chal­lenged the de­nial of their re­li­gious burial rights in the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>On Dec 1, the court dis­missed all the pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>A pe­ti­tioner, 48-year-old ship­ping man­ager Fayaz Joonus, said:</p>
    <p>“Why is Sri Lanka the only coun­try in the world to force us to cre­mate the dead?”</p>
    <p>His fa­ther, BHM Joonus, died on April 1, a day af­ter the cre­ma­tion no­ti­fi­ca­tion was is­sued.</p>
    <p>When the health au­thor­i­ties found the 73-year-old pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the fam­ily had to buy a cof­fin for cre­ma­tion and pay for the ex­penses.</p>
    <p>“It was a painful and sad ex­pe­ri­ence,” said Mr Fayaz.</p>
    <p>Sri Lanka has seen al­most 30,000 Covid-19 cases and 142 have died, in­clud­ing at least 55 Mus­lims.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties re­quire even those sus­pected of hav­ing died of Covid-19 to be cre­mated.</p>
    <p>Mr Naushad Rafaideen said his fa­ther died of chest pain at their Colombo home on May 5, but the hospi­tal in­sisted he be cre­mated, call­ing it a sus­pected Covid-19 case.</p>
    <p>When tests fi­nally showed that his fa­ther did not have Covid-19, Mr Naushad filed a pe­ti­tion in court al­leg­ing “wrong­ful cre­ma­tion”.</p>
    <p>He said: “But the court threw the case out. Is there no so­lu­tion for this?”</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions, Sri Lanka’s Hu­man Rights Com­mis­sion and a hu­man rights com­mis­sion of the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Is­lamic Co­op­er­a­tion have all urged the gov­ern­ment to re­view its burial ban, to no avail.</p>
    <p>Since the end of the 30-year­long civil war in 2009, the Mus­lim mi­nor­ity in Sri Lanka has faced as­saults and vi­o­lence from fun­da­men­tal­ist Sin­halese Bud­dhist groups that have a grow­ing in­flu­ence on the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“We strongly feel it is part of the Sri Lankan gov­ern­ment’s in­sti­tu­tion­alised pol­icy of Is­lam­o­pho­bia and racism,” said Colombo-based hu­man rights ac­tivist Shreen Sa­roor, who has also filed a pe­ti­tion against forcible cre­ma­tions.</p>
    <p>A gov­ern­ment doc­tor who did not want to be named said there is now “a dilemma”, as the ris­ing num­ber of un­claimed bod­ies in the morgue present a health risk.</p>
    <p>“Fam­i­lies are not pay­ing for cre­ma­tion, and the law doesn’t say that the gov­ern­ment can pay the ex­penses. All de­part­ments are pass­ing the buck,” he said.</p>
    <p>It pains me to leave my fa­ther’s body like this, but what can I do? In Is­lam, we be­lieve that a per­son goes to hell if not prop­erly buried.</p>
    <p>MR MO­HAMED, who gave only his first name for fear of reprisal.</p>
