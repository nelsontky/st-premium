    <p>• United States At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr has said that mail-in bal­lots for the Nov 3 elec­tion could be vul­ner­a­ble to fraud, echo­ing an ar­gu­ment Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has made to de­nounce the use of vot­ing by mail.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple try­ing to change the rules to this method­ol­ogy, which, as a mat­ter of logic, is very open to fraud and co­er­cion. It’s reck­less and dan­ger­ous, and peo­ple are play­ing with fire,” Mr Barr said in an in­ter­view with CNN on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Vot­ing by mail is not new in the United States – nearly one in four vot­ers cast pres­i­den­tial bal­lots in 2016 that way.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say voter fraud of any kind is ex­ceed­ingly rare in the United States.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr cited a 2005 re­port by the Com­mis­sion on Fed­eral Elec­tion Re­form, chaired by for­mer pres­i­dent Jimmy Carter and for­mer sec­re­tary of state James Baker, which con­cluded that ab­sen­tee bal­lots are the largest source of po­ten­tial voter fraud.</p>
    <p>“Since that time, there have been in the news­pa­pers, in net­works, aca­demic stud­ies, say­ing it is open to fraud and co­er­cion,” Mr Barr said.</p>
    <p>“The only time the nar­ra­tive changed is af­ter this ad­min­is­tra­tion came in.”</p>
    <p>A record num­ber of mail-in bal­lots are ex­pected for the Nov 3 elec­tion due to con­cerns about in-per­son vot­ing dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with WECT-TV in Wilm­ing­ton, North Carolina, Mr Trump sug­gested that vot­ers should vote twice, once by mail and once in per­son, to make sure their vote was counted.</p>
    <p>“So, let them send it in and let them go vote,” he said.</p>
    <p>“And if the sys­tem is as good as they say it is, then ob­vi­ously they won’t be able to vote” in per­son.</p>
    <p>Vot­ing more than once in an elec­tion is il­le­gal.</p>
