    <p>STRETCH­ING HIS PO­TEN­TIAL</p>
    <p>I was look­ing ahead, what’s hot right now, and what is go­ing to add value to my life ex­pe­ri­ence. And the an­swer must be to ven­ture into new ar­eas, to stretch my po­ten­tial be­yond le­gal and gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>MR AMRIN AMIN, who is look­ing for­ward to us­ing his ex­pe­ri­ence to grow the tech com­pa­nies he will be work­ing for.</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING OUT FOR OTH­ERS</p>
    <p>I will still keep my ears close to the ground. It is a habit that is hard to kick. You don’t quit from feel­ing for the peo­ple you deeply care about, and for the coun­try that you dearly love in just one elec­tion cy­cle. It’s in my blood.</p>
    <p>MR AMRIN, say­ing he will con­tinue to speak up on is­sues that mat­ter to him and for peo­ple whom so­ci­ety might over­look.</p>
    <p>For­mer po­lit­i­cal of­fice-holder and MP Amrin Amin has moved to the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor and will be tak­ing up roles at two lo­cal firms, fol­low­ing his exit from the Gov­ern­ment af­ter the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Amrin, 42, has been ap­pointed strat­egy di­rec­tor at ro­bot­ics and au­to­ma­tion firm Plat­form for Bots and Au­to­ma­tion (PBA).</p>
    <p>A lawyer by train­ing, he will also take up the role of non-ex­ec­u­tive ad­viser at Adera Global, a com­pany in­volved in data se­cu­rity, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and au­to­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>A mem­ber of the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) team that lost to the Work­ers’ Party (WP) team in Sengkang GRC dur­ing the elec­tion, he of­fi­cially starts both roles next Mon­day, but has al­ready been at­tend­ing meet­ings and on­board­ing him­self in these com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Mr Amrin was pre­vi­ously Se­nior Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Home Af­fairs and Health and an MP for Sem­bawang GRC, helm­ing the Wood­lands ward.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times at PBA’s of­fice in Yishun last Fri­day, he said he started think­ing about job-hunt­ing the day af­ter Polling Day on July 10.</p>
    <p>A for­mer part­ner at a law firm, he said re­turn­ing to the le­gal field would have been the “easy way”, but the cut­ting-edge qual­ity of the tech sec­tor ex­cited him and he wanted to try some­thing new.</p>
    <p>“I think that I’ve checked that box,” he said, re­fer­ring to the le­gal sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“And I was look­ing ahead, what’s hot right now, and what is go­ing to add value to my life ex­pe­ri­ence. And the an­swer must be to ven­ture into new ar­eas, to stretch my po­ten­tial be­yond le­gal and gov­ern­ment.”</p>
    <p>But when asked if this meant he would not be re­turn­ing to ei­ther pol­i­tics or law, Mr Amrin laughed and said “never say never”.</p>
    <p>“We can­not be liv­ing in our past, nei­ther do we want to get too ahead of our­selves,” he added.</p>
    <p>BYE BYE, SENGKANG GRC</p>
    <p>Mr Amrin has no re­grets con­test­ing Sengkang GRC, which was newly carved out for the 2020 Gen­eral Elec­tion and made up of the for­mer sin­gle seats of Sengkang West and Pung­gol East, as well as the Sengkang Cen­tral ward of Pasir RisPung­gol GRC.</p>
    <p>“Do I re­gret con­test­ing in Sengkang? Def­i­nitely not. No re­grets be­cause it’s a great hon­our. A great hon­our to fight one of the tough­est bat­tles for the party and stand up for what I be­lieve in,” he said.</p>
    <p>The PAP team lost to WP MPs He Ting Ru, Ja­mus Lim, Louis Chua and Raeesah Khan, who re­ceived 52.1 per cent of the votes.</p>
    <p>Mr Amrin cam­paigned to­gether with labour chief and for­mer min­is­ter Ng Chee Meng, for­mer se­nior min­is­ter of state for health and trans­port Lam Pin Min and PAP new­comer, lawyer Ray­mond Lye.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng re­mains the sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress, while Dr Lam has re­turned to med­i­cal prac­tice. He is chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer and a di­rec­tor at Ea­gle Eye Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Mr Amrin, who be­came an MP in 2015, said the PAP had a good team run­ning in Sengkang, but they re­spect the vot­ers’ choice, as that is “the na­ture of life and pol­i­tics”.</p>
    <p>As much as the re­sult did sur­prise him, it was the re­ac­tions from the peo­ple who ex­pressed their sup­port af­ter the loss that made a deep im­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>In gov­ern­ment, he had, among other things, worked to get for­mer of­fend­ers back on their feet and sup­ported the role of Home Team of­fi­cers. He was also in­volved in ef­forts to up­lift the Malay-Mus­lim com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>As he spoke about the peo­ple who thanked him for his ser­vice, he turned emo­tional. “I thought I was just a small cog in the whole sys­tem, just try­ing my best to do my part, but I was very touched and hum­bled by the depth of sin­cer­ity of peo­ple who came up to share about the im­pact of my work and urged me to con­tinue to serve the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>HELLO, TECH SEC­TOR</p>
    <p>Mr Amrin said he is look­ing for­ward to us­ing his ex­pe­ri­ence to grow the com­pa­nies he will be work­ing for. At PBA, he will fo­cus on its Ro­bot­ics Au­to­ma­tion Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence academy, which trains bud­ding ro­bot­ics pro­fes­sion­als, in­clud­ing mid-ca­reer work­ers. It has trained more than 700 peo­ple since 2018 and has sup­plied over 100 firms with work­ers.</p>
    <p>He will also be help­ing both PBA and Adera to ex­pand their busi­ness here and over­seas. Adera runs ini­tia­tives such as a dig­i­tal pay­ment sys­tem in the Philip­pines and un­manned au­to­mated bank­ing ma­chines in Cam­bo­dia.</p>
    <p>“These are very ex­cit­ing de­vel­op­ments. And im­por­tant too be­cause they en­large Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic foot­print. They pro­vide Sin­ga­pore­ans with more jobs,” said Mr Amrin.</p>
    <p>Be­ing in the pri­vate sec­tor com­ple­ments his ex­pe­ri­ence in law, com­mu­nity work and gov­ern­ment, he said, adding that it will give him a chance to ob­serve cre­ative and tech­no­log­i­cal trends here.</p>
    <p>He said he now gets to spend more time with his one-year-old daugh­ter and his wife, a fam­ily doc­tor. He has been en­joy­ing go­ing to the park, baby gym and catch­ing up on Korean dra­mas. A post last month on his Face­book ac­count for K-drama rec­om­men­da­tions gar­nered over 2,000 re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>He re­mains com­mit­ted to pub­lic ser­vice as the PAP’s Sengkang Cen­tral branch chair­man. He said the work con­tin­ues for him and his run­ning mates. “We’ll just have to do our best as party ac­tivists, not as elected of­fi­cials of course, hav­ing lost the elec­tion. But we do our best as party ac­tivists in that con­stituency,” he said, de­clin­ing to re­veal more.</p>
    <p>With a so­cial me­dia fol­low­ing of close to 55,000 on Face­book and 19,000 on In­sta­gram, Mr Amrin in­tends to con­tinue speak­ing up on is­sues that mat­ter to him and for peo­ple whom so­ci­ety might over­look, such as blue-col­lar work­ers and for­mer of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>“I will still keep my ears close to the ground,” he said. “It is a habit that is hard to kick. You don’t quit from feel­ing for the peo­ple you deeply care about and for the coun­try that you dearly love in just one elec­tion cy­cle. It’s in my blood.”</p>
