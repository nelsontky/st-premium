    <p>A global ac­cred­i­ta­tion frame­work for Covid-19 “vac­ci­na­tion pass­ports” to al­low for in­ter­na­tional travel is some­thing that sev­eral health au­thor­i­ties, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s, are look­ing at.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this will re­quire a lot more study, given how new the coro­n­avirus is. Ques­tions that need fur­ther dis­cus­sion in­clude the na­ture of the vac­cine, how long im­mu­nity would last and if this will ap­ply to re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, the only vac­ci­na­tion cer­tifi­cate ap­pli­ca­ble for global travel is for yel­low fever. The vac­ci­na­tion pro­vides life­long im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>This sub­ject of vac­ci­na­tion pass­ports was among a slew of is­sues dis­cussed on Wed­nes­day at a we­bi­nar ti­tled Covid-19 In Asia Pa­cific – Border Con­trol Pol­icy And The Path To Reopen­ing.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, the we­bi­nar con­vened a panel of seven speak­ers from around the re­gion. They in­cluded Swiss Am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Fabrice Fil­liez and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s South-east Asia re­gional ad­viser Man­isha Shrid­har, as well as rep­re­sen­ta­tives from New Zealand, In­done­sia and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health dean Teo Yik Ying was the mod­er­a­tor.</p>
    <p>A key topic of dis­cus­sion was how strictly a coun­try should con­trol its bor­ders and how the im­pact of im­ported cases on health­care re­sources could be man­aged. To this, the panel­lists said there is no one-siz­e­fits-all ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, many coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, adopt quar­an­tine mea­sures – the safest and most ef­fec­tive way to de­tect im­ported cases. How­ever, given the eco­nomic fall­out from the strict con­trol of bor­ders glob­ally, coun­tries have sought to take a cal­i­brated ap­proach to eas­ing re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Risk as­sess­ments need to be car­ried out, and the panel touched on whether there would be a risk assess­ment frame­work to guide coun­tries, re­gions and the world.</p>
    <p>Such a frame­work would pro­vide a very trans­par­ent way to make de­ci­sions, with clear in­di­ca­tors of when a coun­try can lift border con­trol mea­sures and the ex­tent of re­lax­ation of safety re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The key mea­sures that will form the cor­ner­stone dur­ing the eas­ing of border con­trol mea­sures in­clude test­ing: pre-de­par­ture test­ing, test­ing on ar­rival, as well as re­peated test­ing.</p>
    <p>The panel­lists said de­ci­sions will also have to be made on what kind of tests need to be done – whether to use the gold-stan­dard poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test, or if coun­tries could tap more ad­vanced tech­nolo­gies, such as breath-analysing tests and rapid anti­gen tests.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, a breathal­yser-type di­ag­nos­tic test kit for Covid-19 that pro­vides re­sults in un­der a minute is be­ing de­vel­oped. Now at the pro­to­type stage, the test kit has so far achieved an ac­cu­racy rate of more than 90 per cent dur­ing a pi­lot clin­i­cal trial in­volv­ing 180 pa­tients at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Anti­gen rapid tests are also be­ing pi­loted in Sin­ga­pore, where par­tic­i­pants at cer­tain mass events have to ob­tain a neg­a­tive re­sult be­fore they can gain en­try. Re­sults of these tests are out within 30 min­utes, and tests can be con­ducted at the event venue or at an off-site test­ing fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it is crit­i­cal to note that none of these regimes is fool­proof, and safe man­age­ment mea­sures as well as good con­tact trac­ing sys­tems will re­main crit­i­cal in pre­vent­ing in­fected cases who have en­tered the coun­try from spread­ing the virus within the com­mu­nity, the panel­lists said.</p>
    <p>Ro­bust pub­lic health strate­gies will also boost peo­ple’s con­fi­dence when trav­el­ling, the panel noted.</p>
