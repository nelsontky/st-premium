    <p>ATLANTA • US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den said he has spo­ken with Repub­li­can Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell, and that the two agreed to meet soon, af­ter the law­maker ended his si­lence on the re­sults of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion held six weeks ago.</p>
    <p>Mr McCon­nell con­grat­u­lated Mr Bi­den and Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris on their vic­tory dur­ing re­marks on the Se­nate floor on Tues­day, a day af­ter the Elec­toral Col­lege for­malised the Democrats’ Nov 3 win.</p>
    <p>The sen­a­tor was among many con­gres­sional Repub­li­cans who had not ac­knowl­edged Mr Bi­den’s de­feat of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump while the lat­ter has con­tin­ued to make un­founded claims of elec­tion fraud and re­fused to con­cede.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den told re­porters he spoke with Mr McCon­nell be­fore head­ing to Ge­or­gia, where he will cam­paign for two Demo­cratic US Se­nate can­di­dates whose Jan 5 run-off elec­tions could make or break his do­mes­tic pol­icy agenda.</p>
    <p>“While we dis­agree on a lot of things, there are things we can work to­gether on,” Mr Bi­den told re­porters. “We agreed to get to­gether sooner (rather) than later.”</p>
    <p>Hours af­ter their call, Mr McCon­nell told re­porters that law­mak­ers would not leave Washington this year un­til they have agreed on a new coro­n­avirus eco­nomic re­lief pack­age.</p>
    <p>Top con­gres­sional lead­ers are seek­ing to fi­nalise a gov­ern­ment fund­ing Bill and end a long stand­off on eco­nomic re­lief.</p>
    <p>Mr McCon­nell and his top deputies pressed other Se­nate Repub­li­cans not to j oin with any House Repub­li­cans who may ob­ject to the elec­tion out­come when Congress meets on Jan 6 to rat­ify the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Any such ef­fort to chal­lenge the re­sults is al­most cer­tain to fail since it would re­quire ap­proval by both cham­bers, in­clud­ing the Demo­cratic-con­trolled House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den and Ms Har­ris will be sworn in on the steps of the US Capi­tol on Jan 20 with far fewer peo­ple present than is cus­tom­ary due to the rag­ing coro­n­avirus that has killed more than 300,000 peo­ple in the United States, the in­au­gu­ral plan­ning com­mit­tee said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Fes­tiv­i­ties will be largely vir­tual, and the com­mit­tee urged mem­bers of the pub­lic to re­frain from trav­el­ling to Washington.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has pressed ahead with build­ing his Cabi­net, with word of more picks emerg­ing on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>He has cho­sen Mr Pete But­tigieg, one of his for­mer ri­vals for the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­na­tion, to lead the Transporta­tion De­part­ment, ac­cord­ing to three peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr But­tigieg, 38, the for­mer mayor of South Bend, In­di­ana, would be the first LGBTQ per­son nom­i­nated to Mr Bi­den’s ad­min­is­tra­tion and, if con­firmed, the first LGBTQ Cabi­net sec­re­tary ap­proved by the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Deb Haa­land of New Mex­ico is Mr Bi­den’s lead­ing choice to head the In­te­rior De­part­ment, ac­cord­ing to three sources fa­mil­iar with the pro­ceed­ings, a se­lec­tion that would make her the first Na­tive Amer­i­can to lead a Cabi­net agency.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect’s trip to Atlanta comes nine days af­ter Mr Trump trav­elled to Ge­or­gia in sup­port of the Repub­li­can sen­a­tors seek­ing re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s nar­row win in Ge­or­gia last month un­der­scored the South­ern state’s trans­for­ma­tion from Repub­li­can strong­hold to one of the coun­try’s most com­pet­i­tive po­lit­i­cal bat­tle­grounds.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Sen­a­tors David Per­due and Kelly Lo­ef­fler are fac­ing Demo­cratic chal­lengers Jon Os­soff and Raphael Warnock, re­spec­tively, in twin races that will de­ter­mine which party will con­trol the US Se­nate.</p>
    <p>If the Repub­li­cans win ei­ther con­test, they would main­tain power in the Se­nate, al­low­ing t hem to thwart many of Mr Bi­den’s am­bi­tious leg­isla­tive goals on is­sues such as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the economy and cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>A Demo­cratic sweep would give Mr Bi­den’s party con­trol of the White House and both cham­bers of Congress. Democrats al­ready hold a ma­jor­ity in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
