    <p>There were 49 cases of fallen win­dows across Sin­ga­pore from Jan­uary to last month, but no one was in­jured, said the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity (BCA) last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of them, 32 cases, in­volved case­ment win­dows, while 16 were fallen slid­ing win­dows, and one case of lou­vre win­dows.</p>
    <p>“There were no in­juries from the cases re­ported,” said the BCA in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The agency said i nves­ti­ga­tions showed that the key causes of fallen case­ment win­dows in­cluded win­dows that were found fit­ted with alu­minium riv­ets which had cor­roded.</p>
    <p>“Cor­ro­sion com­pro­mises the strength of the riv­ets, ren­der­ing them un­able to hold the case­ment win­dow pan­els firmly in place,” said BCA.</p>
    <p>Since 2004, BCA has been is­su­ing retrofitti­ng or­ders re­quir­ing home own­ers to re­place all alu­minium riv­ets with stain­less steel ones. Home own­ers can be fined up to $5,000 and jailed for up to six months for fail­ing to carry out the re­place­ments.</p>
    <p>For slid­ing win­dows, a key cause is the lack of proper safety stop­pers and an­gle strips to keep the win­dow pan­els within the tracks, said BCA.</p>
    <p>“Slid­ing win­dow pan­els with­out these safety fea­tures i n place de­tached and fell when home own­ers ap­plied ex­ces­sive out­ward force in open­ing or clos­ing the win­dows,” BCA ex­plained.</p>
    <p>It added that home own­ers should en­sure that the safety fea­tures are in place, and also re­place any worn-out ones.</p>
    <p>If a win­dow falls be­cause of lack of main­te­nance, home own­ers can be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to one year, or both, said the agency.</p>
    <p>Since 2006, 378 peo­ple have been fined and 92 peo­ple were pros­e­cuted for fallen win­dows, said BCA.</p>
    <p>BCA’s fa­cade en­gi­neer­ing and tech­nol­ogy depart­ment di­rec­tor, Mr Lee Chee Weye, said: “Over the past few years, the num­ber of fallen win­dow cases we see yearly re­mains at about 50 cases. While there has not been an in­crease in num­bers, there has also not been any im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>“The risk of in­jury from fall­ing win­dows is high and is not a triv­ial mat­ter. All home own­ers and oc­cu­pants can play a part to mit­i­gate this risk by check­ing and main­tain­ing their win­dows reg­u­larly. To­gether, we can keep our com­mu­nity safe.”</p>
    <p>BCA added that home own­ers can pre­vent fall­ing win­dows by check­ing and main­tain­ing their win­dows at least once ev­ery six months.</p>
    <p>For case­ment win­dows, check that fas­ten­ers are not rusty or loose, and clean and oil the joints or mov­ing parts.</p>
    <p>All alu­minium riv­ets should also be changed to stain­less steel ones by an ap­proved win­dow con­trac­tor.</p>
    <p>For slid­ing win­dows, check that safety stop­pers and an­gle strips are in their proper places, and change those that are worn out. The tracks also have to be cleaned so that win­dow pan­els can slide smoothly.</p>
    <p>Num­ber of cases in­volv­ing case­ment win­dows.</p>
    <p>Num­ber of cases in­volv­ing slid­ing win­dows. There was one case in­volv­ing lou­vre win­dows.</p>
