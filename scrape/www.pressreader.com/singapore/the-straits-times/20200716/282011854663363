    <p>Ten­sions in the South China Sea have risen a notch as the United States de­clared on Mon­day that most of China’s mar­itime claims to the re­sourcerich wa­ter­way are com­pletely un­law­ful. US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo crit­i­cised Bei­jing’s “cam­paign of bul­ly­ing” to un­der­mine the sov­er­eign rights of South-east Asian states with which it has com­pet­ing claims and push them out of off­shore re­sources, re­plac­ing in­ter­na­tional law with “might makes right”. Perti­nently, it came on the fourth an­niver­sary of the ar­bi­tral tri­bunal rul­ing, on a case brought by the Philip­pines, that China’s his­toric rights claim to re­sources in al­most the en­tire sea is in­valid. Mr Pom­peo’s state­ment aligns the US po­si­tion on China’s mar­itime claims with that of the tri­bunal de­ci­sion – which Bei­jing has re­jected.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton’s po­si­tion of sup­port for the rul­ing of the tri­bunal – con­sti­tuted un­der the 1982 United Na­tions Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea (Un­c­los) – un­der­scores the im­por­tance of em­pha­sis­ing ad­her­ence to in­ter­na­tional law in the man­ag­ing and res­o­lu­tion of dis­putes in the South China Sea. It is also in keep­ing with Asean’s own view. At its lead­ers’ sum­mit last month, the re­gional group­ing reaf­firmed in a state­ment that the 1982 Un­c­los is the ba­sis for de­ter­min­ing mar­itime en­ti­tle­ments, sov­er­eign rights, ju­ris­dic­tion and le­git­i­mate in­ter­ests over mar­itime zones. It added that the con­ven­tion sets out the le­gal frame­work within which all ac­tiv­i­ties in the seas and oceans must be car­ried out.</p>
    <p>This em­pha­sis comes at a time of height­ened con­cern over the pos­si­bil­ity of con­flicts in the South China Sea. This is as coun­tries in the re­gion feel China’s as­sertive­ness in its mar­itime claims in such forms as its coast guard nudg­ing off their fish­ing fleets in dis­puted wa­ters, and Chi­nese ships’ ha­rass­ing en­ergy ex­plo­ration ac­tiv­i­ties of their oil com­pa­nies. What is also wor­ry­ing is the US send­ing of two air­craft car­ri­ers into the area last week near where China was hav­ing its own naval ex­er­cises close to the dis­puted Para­cel Is­lands. The US’ state­ment that opens up Wash­ing­ton to the use of eco­nomic sanc­tions against</p>
    <p>China over the South China Sea should pro­vide some re­lief to the re­gion’s anx­i­eties.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries in the re­gion should not be un­der any il­lu­sion that this move is not about the in­ten­si­fy­ing US-China ri­valry. This state­ment on the South China Sea and Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s sign­ing of the Hong Kong Au­ton­omy Act on Tues­day that im­poses sanc­tions on in­di­vid­u­als and busi­ness en­ti­ties seen to be com­plicit in the ero­sion of the city’s au­ton­omy are all part of its strat­egy. Yet, in align­ing it­self with Un­c­los – even though it is not a sig­na­tory – the US may help strengthen Asean’s hand in stress­ing in­ter­na­tional law in the South China Sea dis­putes, and it would not be a sur­prise if the re­gion’s lead­ers were to cau­tiously wel­come it.</p>
