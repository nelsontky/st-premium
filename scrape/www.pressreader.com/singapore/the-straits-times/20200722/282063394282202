    <p>The Hous­ing Board should re­view its pol­icy of peg­ging the HDB hous­ing loan in­ter­est rate at</p>
    <p>0.1 per­cent­age point above the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Or­di­nary Ac­count in­ter­est rate.</p>
    <p>The HDB hous­ing loan in­ter­est rate at 2.6 per cent a year has been much higher than that for bank loans since 2008. Go­ing for­ward, with the slow­down in global growth due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, in­ter­est rates are ex­pected to re­main low and the HDB hous­ing loan in­ter­est rate is likely to re­main higher than that for bank loans.</p>
    <p>Since Jan­uary 2003, HDB mort­gagors have been able to re­fi­nance their loans with banks if they find the banks’ rates to be more at­trac­tive.</p>
    <p>But there are many rea­sons one would con­tinue to stay with HDB loans. Some fear that banks are not as sym­pa­thetic as the HDB when it comes to late pay­ment. Some do not re­fi­nance as they are un­able to meet the banks’ credit as­sess­ments.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the HDB’s au­dited fi­nan­cial state­ments for the year ended March 31 last year, to­tal hous­ing loans amounted to</p>
    <p>$40.3 bil­lion as of that date, and late pay­ment charges amounted to $31.8 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>While I do not have the pro­file of the mort­gagors be­hind the size­able late pay­ment charges, I sus­pect the ma­jor­ity are from the lower-in­come group.</p>
    <p>They would have paid more in hous­ing loan in­ter­est in the past 12 years, and as a re­sult have less CPF sav­ings for com­pound­ing and ul­ti­mately less CPF sav­ings for re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>It does not make sense to con­tinue charg­ing lower-in­come Sin­ga­pore­ans above mar­ket rates for their hous­ing loans.</p>
    <p>The HDB could ex­plore fi­nanc­ing the hous­ing loans with bank loans and pass­ing some of the cost sav­ings to the mort­gagors.</p>
    <p>In­ci­den­tally, the HDB, on June 24 this year, is­sued $800 mil­lion, 10-year fixed-rate notes un­der its $32 bil­lion multi-cur­rency medium-term note pro­gramme to fi­nance its de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes and work­ing cap­i­tal re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The notes have a coupon of 1.265 per cent a year. Struc­tur­ing a sim­i­lar pro­gramme to fi­nance the hous­ing loans should not be dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>In view of the ever-de­creas­ing leases of HDB flats and im­pact of Covid-19, re­vis­it­ing this is­sue is all the more per­ti­nent now.</p>
