    <p>The Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) has urged Mus­lims to get vac­ci­nated once a Covid-19 vac­cine is avail­able, and med­i­cally au­tho­rised as safe and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>In an irsyad– or re­li­gious guid­ance – is­sued yes­ter­day, Muis said a Covid-19 vac­cine is per­mis­si­ble for use by Mus­lims as it is a ba­sic ne­ces­sity to pro­tect lives in the con­text of a global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The ob­jec­tives of in­tro­duc­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine and the pro­cesses in­volved in pro­duc­ing vac­cines in gen­eral are largely aligned to es­tab­lished Is­lamic prin­ci­ples and val­ues,” it added, not­ing that Is­lam places great im­por­tance on the sanc­tity and safety of hu­man life as well as the pro­tec­tion of liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>Muis pointed to a fatwa, or Is­lamic rul­ing, it is­sued in 2013 on the ro­tavirus vac­cine. The rul­ing con­sid­ered vac­cines to be a form of pre­ven­tive treat­ment from dis­eases and en­cour­aged in Is­lam.</p>
    <p>“This is drawn from the prophetic guid­ance that one should con­sume foods that of­fer some pro­tec­tion from ill­nesses,” it added.</p>
    <p>Muis’ re­li­gious guid­ance comes on the back of con­cerns among Mus­lims in the neigh­bour­ing coun­tries of Malaysia and In­done­sia over the ha­lal sta­tus of a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The re­li­gious view of a Covid-19 vac­cine must take a more holis­tic stance that “tran­scends the nar­row view of ha­lal­ness or per­mis­si­bil­ity of its in­gre­di­ents”, Muis said, set­ting out three ar­eas that it said have been care­fully con­sid­ered.</p>
    <p>First, vac­cines are a crit­i­cal ne­ces­sity in sav­ing lives and en­sur­ing so­ci­eties can func­tion safely and co­he­sively.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond im­por­tant con­sid­er­a­tion is that any vac­cine must not have any known ad­verse med­i­cal ef­fects that will cause harm to those who take it.</p>
    <p>On the per­mis­si­bil­ity of in­gre­di­ents used in vac­cines, Muis cited a 2015 rul­ing on the drug hep­arin, a blood thin­ner which con­tains pig en­zymes, as an ex­am­ple of a sit­u­a­tion – ev­i­dent in some prophetic tra­di­tions – that per­mits the use of im­pure or pro­hib­ited sub­stances for treat­ment.</p>
    <p>“The im­pure sub­stances or pro­hib­ited items used in up­stream pro­cesses would have un­der­gone mul­ti­ple lay­ers of chem­i­cal pro­cesses such as fil­tra­tion that would ren­der them un­de­tectable or neg­li­gi­ble in the fi­nal prod­uct,” Muis said.</p>
    <p>“In such sit­u­a­tions, the fi­nal prod­uct (drug or vac­cine) is deemed per­mis­si­ble for Mus­lim use.”</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli wel­comed Muis’ re­li­gious guid­ance and strongly en­cour­aged Mus­lims to get vac­ci­nated once the vac­cines are avail­able in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“I am thank­ful to our re­li­gious lead­ers who are highly knowl­edge­able, pro­gres­sive, en­light­ened, and at­tuned to the con­cerns of our Malay/Mus­lim com­mu­nity in the con­text of the global pan­demic,” he said.</p>
    <p>The re­li­gious view of a Covid-19 vac­cine must take a more holis­tic stance that “tran­scends the nar­row view of ha­lal­ness or per­mis­si­bil­ity of its in­gre­di­ents”, Muis said.</p>
