    <p>Re­searchers from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) have devel­oped a smart­phone-pow­ered suit that can track one’s temperatur­e, pos­ture and move­ments at the same time.</p>
    <p>Bear­ing a close re­sem­blance to Spi­der-Man’s cos­tume, the suit’s de­sign con­sists of a re­cur­ring pat­tern of web-like threads, which are key in con­nect­ing the smart­phone to sen­sor chips placed around the body.</p>
    <p>Sewn with con­duc­tive sil­ver threads, the pat­terns act as hubs re­lay­ing the smart­phone’s near-field com­mu­ni­ca­tion sig­nal to the se­lected lo­ca­tions around the body.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor John Ho, who led the team of re­searchers from the NUS In­sti­tute for Health In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy, said: “Our smart suit works with most mod­ern smart­phones, which act as both the source of power as well as the dis­play to view the sen­sor data.</p>
    <p>“The cre­ation of a smart suit which can be pow­ered us­ing builtin smart­phone wire­less tech­nol­ogy is a ma­jor break­through.”</p>
    <p>The re­search find­ings were pub­lished in sci­en­tific jour­nal Na­ture Com­mu­ni­ca­tions in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>To bet­ter un­der­stand and ex­pe­ri­ence the novelty of this tech­nol­ogy, I wore the smart suit.</p>
    <p>The com­plete pro­to­type suit has three sep­a­rate pieces – a jumper, a dry-fit tee and a pair of tights, all of which are able to sup­port up to six sensors at the same time.</p>
    <p>I started with the jumper. Or­ange-coloured sen­sor chips were then stuck to cir­cu­lar hubs lo­cated around the suit.</p>
    <p>To ac­ti­vate the sensors, the smart­phone has to be care­fully aligned to the suit’s epi­cen­tre, which is the largest hub lo­cated promi­nently across the ch­est.</p>
    <p>The phone buzzed and the LED lights on the sensors turned blue, in­di­cat­ing that the con­nec­tion was suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>I checked my temperatur­e by gen­tly press­ing the sen­sor node with my in­dex fin­ger.</p>
    <p>I ob­served a graph on the phone app as the sen­sor mon­i­tored my body temperatur­e. It climbed steadily and even­tu­ally peaked at 34 deg C.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause our body temperatur­e, when taken from the fin­gers, tends to be a lit­tle lower than usual.</p>
    <p>Next, I tried a run­ning gait func­tion, which tracked my move­ments over time and de­tected any signs of fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>To ac­ti­vate these sensors, the smart­phone was placed in a pocket be­hind my right thigh where the hub was lo­cated, and the sensors on my tights lit up.</p>
    <p>To mimic run­ning move­ments, I bent my knee re­peat­edly, and the data was recorded on the app.</p>
    <p>Prof Ho ex­plained that the sensors are able to con­tin­u­ously record data dur­ing the span of a run, and de­tect any vari­abil­ity in one’s run­ning stance.</p>
    <p>High vari­abil­ity would in­di­cate pos­si­ble fa­tigue and over-ex­er­tion.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, I looked at my spinal pos­ture.</p>
    <p>I changed into the dry-fit tee, which has a small pocket on its right sleeve where the phone is placed. A sen­sor chip was stuck onto the back of my neck to fa­cil­i­tate easy demon­stra­tion.</p>
    <p>As I bent my neck re­peat­edly, the app con­tin­u­ously tracked and recorded my move­ments. Ideally, the suit should be used to mon­i­tor one’s pos­ture over the course of a day, with sensors placed along the spine to de­tect how fre­quently the back bends, giv­ing an in­di­ca­tion of pos­ture.</p>
    <p>This can help clin­i­cians bet­ter un­der­stand pa­tients who face chronic back pain, us­ing the in­sights for di­ag­no­sis and treat­ment, said Prof Ho.</p>
    <p>The team is look­ing to im­prove the app in­ter­face so that all sen­sor data can be dis­played at the same time for easy track­ing.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers also plan to de­velop new sensors to in­crease the range of data col­lec­tion, in­clud­ing for sweat de­tec­tion, which in­di­cates pos­si­ble de­hy­dra­tion, and blood oxy­gen lev­els to de­tect early signs of res­pi­ra­tory dis­tress.</p>
