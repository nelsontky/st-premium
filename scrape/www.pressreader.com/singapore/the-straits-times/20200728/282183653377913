    <p>HONG KONG • A new in­dex fo­cused on China’s tech­nol­ogy gi­ants is set to give in­vestors greater ac­cess to their grow­ing dom­i­nance in Hong Kong’s mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The new in­dex will track the 30 largest tech com­pa­nies listed in the city. The Hang Seng Tech In­dex will in­clude Ten­cent Hold­ings, Alibaba Group Hold­ing, Meituan Dian­ping and Xiaomi. The gauge would have achieved re­turns of 36.2 per cent for 2019 and 35.3 per cent for the first half of this year, ac­cord­ing to com­piler Hang Seng In­dexes.</p>
    <p>The move comes at a time when fur­ther listings of Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy firms are in the pipeline, such as Jack Ma’s Ant Group, fol­low­ing those of NetEase and JD.com. List­ing closer to home has be­come more at­trac­tive as ten­sions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing threaten to cur­tail Chi­nese com­pa­nies’ ac­cess to the United States’ cap­i­tal mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The com­piler of the Hang Seng In­dex has al­ready em­braced change through moves such as scrap­ping a weight­ing limit for dual-class shares on some of its gauges. The tech in­dex is seen help­ing in­vestors bridge a gap be­tween a Hong Kong bench­mark over­stuffed with old econ­omy banks and in­sur­ers, and the tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies that have emerged as big win­ners in the city’s beaten-down mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“There are too many lag­gards in the Hang Seng In­dex,” said Core Pa­cific-Ya­maichi In­ter­na­tional Hong Kong’s head of re­search Cas­tor Pang. “With over­seaslisted Chi­nese firms de­cid­ing to list closer to home, the Hong Kong mar­ket falls short in terms of hav­ing a rep­re­sen­ta­tive in­dex for these stocks. This new in­dex serves to fill this gap and drive cap­i­tal flows.”</p>
    <p>Citi an­a­lysts led by Mr Pierre Lau wrote in a re­cent note that the in­dex will at­tract in­vestors to other Hong Kong tech stocks, fa­cil­i­tate the is­suance of in­dex-linked funds and de­riv­a­tives and boost turnover at Hong Kong Ex­changes and Clear­ing. That stock is up 42 per cent this year, most in the Hang Seng In­dex.</p>
    <p>Sup­ported by strong main­land in­flows through stock-con­nect links, Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy shares have emerged as big win­ners in Hong Kong this year. Ten­cent has surged 41 per cent while Meituan is up 87 per cent. The Hang Seng In­dex, how­ever, has un­der-per­formed. It has fallen 12 per cent this year, with half of its mem­bers down at least 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mor­gan Stan­ley sees the new tech­nol­ogy gauge pro­vid­ing a big­ger sen­ti­ment boost near-term to the MSCI China In­dex than the Hang Seng, which has few com­po­nents that will also be in the tech in­dex. “The di­rect stock-level pos­i­tives can­not trans­late into a mean­ing­ful in­dex-level boost,” an­a­lysts led by Ms Laura Wang wrote.</p>
