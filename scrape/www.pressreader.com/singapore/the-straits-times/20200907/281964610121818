    <p>Find­ing a vac­cine against Covid-19 that works and can be dis­trib­uted widely enough to help stop the pan­demic is a global pri­or­ity. Given the ur­gency, gov­ern­ments are do­ing all they can to fund re­search and in­cen­tivise firms to ramp up tri­als – pre-or­der­ing doses, low­er­ing reg­u­la­tory bar­ri­ers to mar­ket and grant­ing man­u­fac­tur­ers im­mu­nity from costly fu­ture in­jury-re­lated law­suits.</p>
    <p>But when does the scram­ble for sup­ply start to look like cor­ner-cut­ting?</p>
    <p>Even in a pan­demic as deadly as this one, pub­lic trust in a vac­cine is vul­ner­a­ble. A July-Au­gust Ip­sos world­wide poll for the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum found that while three in four adults were in­ter­ested in get­ting a Covid-19 vac­cine if it was avail­able, only 37 per cent had a “strong” in­ter­est in do­ing so. That’s a far cry from the es­ti­mated herd im­mu­nity thresh­old of 55 per cent to 82 per cent.</p>
    <p>The top two rea­sons cited for not want­ing to take a Covid-19 vac­cine are a fear of side ef­fects and doubts it will ac­tu­ally work – not ex­treme “anti-vaxx” sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>While an ef­fec­tive vac­cine would be an un­ques­tion­able pub­lic good, you can see how fears of a rush job might take hold.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin’s shock ap­proval last month of a vac­cine be­fore large-scale pa­tient tri­als had been com­pleted is a gam­ble that could ac­tu­ally set back the coun­try’s re­sponse to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In the United States, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump wants a vac­cine rolled out be­fore Elec­tion Day, spark­ing wor­ries that an even­tual green light will be seen as a po­lit­i­cal de­ci­sion rather than one based on com­pre­hen­sive data.</p>
    <p>On top of that comes the prac­tice of of­fer­ing le­gal im­mu­nity to mak­ers of vac­cines and emer­gency treat­ments. While help­ful in keep­ing com­pa­nies from get­ting bogged down in court bat­tles, it isn’t ex­actly con­ducive to build­ing pub­lic trust.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the US’s ex­ist­ing Pub­lic Readi­ness and Emer­gency Pre­pared­ness Act or “Prep” pan­demic leg­is­la­tion shields firms from al­most all in­jury-re­lated law­suits un­less the cause is deemed wil­ful mis­con­duct (a high bar). That’s an “ex­traor­di­nar­ily broad” view, ex­plains pro­fes­sor of law Wendy Parmet at</p>
    <p>North­east­ern Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>While fi­nan­cial com­pen­sa­tion is avail­able, it is cov­ered en­tirely by the tax­payer, capped at a life­time max­i­mum of US$311,810 (S$426,000) re­gard­less of the in­jury and de­cided by a spe­cial panel with no op­por­tu­nity for ju­di­cial re­view.</p>
    <p>It has served to pour fuel on anti-vaxxers’ out­rage, rather than si­lence them.</p>
    <p>No won­der some pa­tient ad­vo­cates have been spooked by lob­by­ing pres­sure in Europe – where the bur­den of li­a­bil­ity is seen as less favourable for drug­mak­ers – to adopt a sys­tem closer to the Amer­i­can one, as re­ported by the Fi­nan­cial Times.</p>
    <p>While the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion in­sists it won’t com­pro­mise on safety, or change li­a­bil­ity rules, it has sug­gested gov­ern­ments could take on “cer­tain” le­gal claims.</p>
    <p>This has led to pub­lic anger in the past. Dur­ing the 2009 H1N1 pan­demic, many Euro­pean gov­ern­ments took on li­a­bil­ity risk in ex­change for fast-tracked vac­cines, some of which ended up be­ing re­called over links to nar­colepsy.</p>
    <p>A with­er­ing Coun­cil of Europe re­port at the time warned such deals pri­va­tised vac­cine prof­its and so­cialised the risk of in­juries, call­ing for more bal­ance in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The race for a Covid-19 vac­cine could there­fore do with a few speed bumps in the name of trust.</p>
    <p>The need for large-scale pa­tient tri­als hasn’t gone away, and more data and dis­clo­sure on the road to ap­provals for pub­lic use might help win over an im­por­tant pri­or­ity group – health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>They aren’t im­mune to vac­cine scep­ti­cism: In France, the birth­place of Louis Pas­teur, a 2014 survey found one-quar­ter of doc­tors thought some rec­om­mended vac­cines were use­less, and one-fifth thought chil­dren were be­ing given too many shots. Given they have the ear of their pa­tients, this is an is­sue.</p>
    <p>It should also be pos­si­ble to pre­serve an ef­fec­tive sup­ply of vac­cine doses with­out tip­ping the scales of li­a­bil­ity com­pletely away from man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>One idea floated by a Bri­tish In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional and Com­par­a­tive Law re­search project is for a new Covid-19 com­pen­sa­tion fund de­signed to deal both sym­pa­thet­i­cally and ef­fi­ciently with in­jury claims with­out hav­ing to go through the courts. In­stead of be­ing funded en­tirely by the tax­payer, it could be part-fi­nanced by the pri­vate sec­tor, thereby en­sur­ing phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms have some skin in the game.</p>
    <p>This won’t cure vac­cine hes­i­tancy overnight, but it might al­lay some fears.</p>
    <p>There are lim­its to en­gag­ing with vac­cine crit­ics, of course, and no quar­ter should be given to hard­ened anti-vaxxers – vac­ci­na­tion has a 200-year his­tory and played a crit­i­cal role in erad­i­cat­ing the likes of small­pox and po­lio.</p>
    <p>But there’s still time to ex­tend a hand to the hes­i­tant.</p>
