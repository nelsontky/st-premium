    <p>JAKARTA • A five-day-old baby has died of Covid-19 in South Su­lawesi, In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The baby’s mother ini­tially had a re­ac­tive rapid test re­sult, which led to both of them tak­ing swab tests that came back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>“The swab test re­sults came back on Oct 13. The sam­ples were ex­am­ined by the l ab­o­ra­tory of Wahidin Sudiro­hu­sodo Hos­pi­tal, Makas­sar,” said the head of disease preven­tion and con­trol at Jeneponto Health Agency, Suryan­ingrat, last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>In June, a 40-day-old baby died in Pamekasan re­gency, East Java, af­ter con­tract­ing Covid-19, be­lieved to have been spread by neigh­bours who vis­ited the new­born.</p>
    <p>The baby, who tested pos­i­tive for the virus when he was 28 days old, died in hos­pi­tal af­ter nearly two weeks of treat­ment. “Based on the con­tact trac­ing we car­ried out, the baby con­tracted Covid-19 from neigh­bours who vis­ited him soon af­ter he was born,” Pamekasan re­gency Covid-19 task force chief Syai­ful Hi­dayat said.</p>
    <p>He said many vis­i­tors had held the baby. Soon af­ter the vis­its, the baby showed symp­toms of Covid-19, in­clud­ing a fever, cough­ing and laboured breath­ing.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian Pae­di­atric So­ci­ety re­vealed in June that at least 1,543 chil­dren in In­done­sia had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 since the coun­try an­nounced its first coro­n­avirus cases in March. Thirty-six of them died of the disease.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 6,123 chil­dren have been cat­e­gorised un­der PDP sta­tus, which refers to peo­ple who have Covid-19 symp­toms but have not been tested for the virus. Of those chil­dren, 204 have died.</p>
    <p>There are still many ques­tions sur­round­ing coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion in chil­dren and in­fants.</p>
    <p>On its web­site, the US Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) says it is un­clear whether chil­dren are as sus­cep­ti­ble to in­fec­tion from Sars-CoV-2 as adults, and whether they can trans­mit the virus as ef­fec­tively as adults.</p>
    <p>Re­cent ev­i­dence sug­gests that chil­dren likely have the same or higher vi­ral loads in their na­sophar­ynx as adults, and they can spread the virus ef­fec­tively in house­holds, the CDC says.</p>
