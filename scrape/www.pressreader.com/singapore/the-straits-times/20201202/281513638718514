    <p>Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy com­pany Moderna has asked the au­thor­i­ties here to ap­prove the use of its Covid-19 vac­cine in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>If all goes well, the first vac­cines could ar­rive as early as this month.</p>
    <p>Moderna chief ex­ec­u­tive Stephane Ban­cel told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the com­pany is in talks with the Health Sciences Author­ity (HSA).</p>
    <p>“We’ve started sending to Sin­ga­pore all the in­for­ma­tion that we have, and we’re hav­ing a very good di­a­logue with (HSA),” he said.</p>
    <p>“It is, of course, their de­ci­sion how long they need to be com­fort­able with the data be­cause their (pri­or­ity) is to en­sure safety, but I an­tic­i­pate that it could be maybe in De­cem­ber, maybe in Jan­uary.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ban­cel de­clined to give de­tails on the num­ber of doses that Sin­ga­pore would re­ceive, cit­ing con­fi­den­tial­ity clauses, but said Moderna will be ready to ship its vac­cines here “right away”, once ap­proval has been given.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times has ap­proached HSA for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Last month, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said Sin­ga­pore will work on se­cur­ing a port­fo­lio of Covid-19 vac­cines in­stead of re­ly­ing on just one vac­cine.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Moderna ap­plied for emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion of its vac­cine in the United States, fol­low­ing the re­lease of the full re­sults from its late-stage clin­i­cal trial, which showed the vac­cine was 94.1 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing Covid-19, and 100 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing se­vere disease.</p>
    <p>The US fil­ing sets Moderna’s prod­uct up as the se­cond vac­cine likely to re­ceive US emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion this year, on the heels of an­other Covid-19 vac­cine front run­ner by Pfizer and BioN­Tech.</p>
    <p>Both vac­cines pro­tect against</p>
    <p>se­vere forms of the disease, but the data is not yet clear about whether they will pre­vent peo­ple who have been vac­ci­nated from spread­ing Sars-CoV-2 – the virus which causes Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Both vac­cines lever­age a new tech­nol­ogy called mes­sen­ger RNA (mRNA). There are no mRNA vac­cines cur­rently avail­able on the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ban­cel said peo­ple can be con­fi­dent about safety. He said mRNA vac­cines have been tested on hu­mans, cit­ing clin­i­cal tri­als in Ger­many that took place be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Ban­cel also noted that no se­vere ad­verse events had oc­curred among vol­un­teers dur­ing the lat­estage clin­i­cal trial for Moderna’s Covid-19 vac­cine. “If you look at all vac­cines, across all tech­nolo­gies, known to reg­u­la­tors, any se­ri­ous side ef­fects usu­ally hap­pen within six weeks of the jab,” he said.</p>
    <p>This is why the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion had asked Moderna to sub­mit its ap­pli­ca­tion for emer­gency ap­proval only af­ter eight weeks of safety data be­ing col­lected.</p>
    <p>“We crossed that thresh­old in the se­cond half of Novem­ber, which is why we were able to sub­mit (the ap­pli­ca­tion),” Mr Ban­cel said in a video in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The mRNA plat­form in­volves in­ject­ing snip­pets of the vi­ral ge­netic code into the body to stim­u­late the hu­man im­mune sys­tem to mount a de­fence against the in­vad­ing virus.</p>
    <p>The mRNA mol­e­cule fully de­grades in the body within 48 hours, Mr Ban­cel said. “More­over, the mol­e­cule does not en­ter the nu­cleus of the hu­man cell, does not touch the hu­man DNA,” he added.</p>
    <p>Asked if Moderna would con­sider ex­pand­ing to Sin­ga­pore, Mr Ban­cel said there are no plans to do so yet. “We have been so busy work­ing on the vac­cine that we have had no time to think about ex­pan­sion,” he added.</p>
    <p>But he said he has vis­ited Sin­ga­pore 20 times and is aware that the Repub­lic is a “great biotech hub” with an ed­u­cated work­force that has a strong work ethic. “I’m sure we’ll find ways to col­lab­o­rate more and more with Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
