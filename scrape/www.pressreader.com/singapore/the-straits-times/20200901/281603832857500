    <p>Tai­wan shows that pub­lic health is key as it sets about lev­er­ag­ing the dis­rup­tions thrown up by the Covid-19 cri­sis to trans­form its econ­omy, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Goh Sui Noi (be­low).</p>
    <p>Life for Taipei denizen Brenda Wu, 50, a house­wife, has been pretty nor­mal the past few months de­spite the rag­ing Covid-19 pan­demic world­wide.</p>
    <p>She has been do­ing the things she usu­ally does – tak­ing her walks, go­ing to the cin­ema and din­ing out with fam­ily mem­bers and friends.</p>
    <p>The only dif­fer­ence is, she is al­ways armed with a face mask – manda­tory on pub­lic trans­port – and her home­made hand sani­tiser, which she uses to wipe down the din­ing ta­ble if she is eat­ing out.</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, she at­tended a wed­ding din­ner in the south­ern port city of Kaoh­si­ung – a big af­fair of about 40 ta­bles – and took the op­por­tu­nity to make a day trip to the is­land of Xiao Li­uqiu for some div­ing.</p>
    <p>It is much the same for</p>
    <p>Ms Tina Chung, 49, who works in ad­min­is­tra­tion at a med­i­cal col­lege in Sanchih district and goes to the of­fice daily. But she stopped tak­ing her 86-year-old mother out to lunch on week­ends just to be on the safe side, un­til May, a month be­fore so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures were re­laxed in June.</p>
    <p>This near nor­mal­ity of life in Tai­wan con­trasts sharply with how other economies have been cop­ing with the Covid-19 pan­demic. Many cities in Asia and be­yond had to go into com­pre­hen­sive lock­downs or tar­geted lock­downs to tame their first out­breaks and re-im­pose some strin­gent mea­sures to bring down the num­ber of in­fec­tions fol­low­ing re­lax­ation of re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>POS­I­TIVE RE­TURNS FROM EARLY IN­TER­VEN­TION</p>
    <p>This is be­cause Tai­wan acted early and ef­fec­tively to con­tain its coro­n­avirus out­break, which be­gan in Jan­uary when some Tai­wanese re­turn­ing from China brought the virus back with them.</p>
    <p>The is­land did not im­pose shut­downs but took some pre­ven­tive mea­sures, in­clud­ing lim­it­ing large gath­er­ings to 100, mak­ing it com­pul­sory to wear masks on pub­lic trans­port and ex­hort­ing peo­ple to keep 1.5m apart. Schools, which were closed when the out­break be­gan, ex­tended their win­ter break by two weeks.</p>
    <p>Yet, with a pop­u­la­tion of 23 mil­lion, it has reg­is­tered just</p>
    <p>488 con­firmed cases so far, with 55 lo­cal trans­mis­sions and seven deaths.</p>
    <p>That early and ef­fec­tive action has meant that the is­land is less af­fected by job losses and its econ­omy will likely out­per­form those of the other three Asian tigers – South Korea, Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore. The Tai­wanese govern­ment has forecast growth of 1.56 per cent for this year, down from 2.73 per cent last year. This com­pares well with South Korea’s mi­nus 0.2 per cent, Hong Kong’s mi­nus 6 per cent to mi­nus 8 per cent and Sin­ga­pore’s mi­nus 5 per cent to mi­nus 7 per cent.</p>
    <p>Of course, the fact that the semi­con­duc­tor and in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy sec­tors are key pil­lars of Tai­wan’s econ­omy has helped, as th­ese in­dus­tries have done well dur­ing this global health cri­sis. Life­style shifts to­wards telecom­mut­ing, re­mote learn­ing and on­line shop­ping have driven up global tech de­mand.</p>
    <p>But like other economies, its tourism, hos­pi­tal­ity, re­tail, food and bev­er­age and trans­port in­dus­tries have been rav­aged as bor­ders closed and global travel came al­most to a stand­still and as Tai­wanese took pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures against the virus.</p>
    <p>And, as pointed out by</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank head of Greater China re­search Tommy Xie, Tai­wan as an ex­port-re­liant econ­omy has seen its ex­ports hit hard by slug­gish ex­ter­nal de­mand.</p>
    <p>Now, as the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion is un­der con­trol and Tai­wan has not had a sin­gle lo­cal in­fec­tion in more than 100 days since April 8, it is ready to look be­yond fight­ing the virus to mak­ing the most of the changed en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with the Tai­wan Busi­ness Top­ics magazine of the</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce in Taipei pub­lished last month, eco­nomic plan­ner Kung Ming-hsin said Tai­wan would ride on op­por­tu­ni­ties thrown up by the pan­demic and move ahead with plans to turn Tai­wan into a dig­i­tal-based econ­omy.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil Min­is­ter, as his com­ments showed, is fully aware that Tai­wan’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery de­pends not just on how quickly a vac­cine is de­vel­oped and dis­trib­uted, but also on re­duc­ing the spread of the virus as any resur­gence will undo all the good work done.</p>
    <p>There is a de­bate on whether there should be mass test­ing of trav­ellers from abroad to bet­ter iden­tify asymp­to­matic pa­tients as the is­land cau­tiously opens up its bor­ders in­clud­ing to for­eign vis­i­tors seek­ing med­i­cal care. Trav­ellers from over­seas al­ready face strin­gent quar­an­tine re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>WHAT HAS HELPED</p>
    <p>Tai­wan was able to re­act early and ef­fec­tively be­cause it had a strong plan for man­ag­ing a pan­demic that had been in place since the Sars (se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome) scare of 2003, in which 346 peo­ple were in­fected and 73 died.</p>
    <p>“They have pro­fes­sion­als run­ning the show. Th­ese are peo­ple who have trained for years for this,” Prince­ton Univer­sity health pol­icy an­a­lyst Cheng Tsung-mei told CNBC re­cently.</p>
    <p>By Jan 20, days be­fore the Wuhan lock­down, the Cen­tral Epi­demic Com­mand Cen­tre (CECC), formed af­ter the Sars epi­demic to deal with such out­breaks, was ac­ti­vated to deal with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Per­haps be­ing ex­cluded from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has made Tai­wan more care­ful about hav­ing its own sys­tem in place to deal with pan­demics early enough.</p>
    <p>The CECC – ac­ti­vated at least thrice be­fore now, in­clud­ing dur­ing the 2009 H1N1 pan­demic – co­or­di­nated action across govern­ment agen­cies and held daily brief­ings that gave not just im­por­tant in­for­ma­tion to the pub­lic, but also prac­ti­cal ad­vice.</p>
    <p>One of the ses­sions had Health Min­is­ter Chen Shih-chung demon­strat­ing how to dis­in­fect dis­pos­able masks us­ing an elec­tric steamer found in most Tai­wanese homes, at a time when there was a mask short­age.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan never did make mask-wear­ing manda­tory, ex­cept on pub­lic trans­port, although it en­cour­aged those vis­it­ing hos­pi­tals or who were ill with res­pi­ra­tory or chronic dis­eases to wear one.</p>
    <p>How­ever, as Ms Wu ob­served, nine out of 10 Tai­wanese who were out and about wore a mask dur­ing the first few months of the out­break, although only about 50 per cent of peo­ple do so now as the is­land’s epi­demic has abated. The Tai­wanese early vig­i­lance against the coro­n­avirus surely helped.</p>
    <p>To ad­dress a mask short­age early on, the govern­ment banned the ex­port of masks and ramped up pro­duc­tion, in­clud­ing set­ting up in dou­ble-quick time new fac­to­ries. Ac­cord­ing to Mr Kung, mask-mak­ing ma­chines that nor­mally took up to half a year to in­stall were put to­gether in just one month.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple were able to or­der masks on­line through a mo­bile app and col­lect them at con­ve­nience stores us­ing an­other app of a real-time map show­ing where masks were in stock. To pre­vent hoard­ing, they were lim­ited to nine masks per per­son per fort­night.</p>
    <p>But a cru­cial mea­sure was Tai­wan’s integratio­n of its health­care data­base with its im­mi­gra­tion data­base that gave health­care providers ac­cess to pa­tients’ travel his­to­ries, en­abling them to give im­me­di­ate alerts and al­low­ing early de­tec­tion of cases.</p>
    <p>The use of tech­nol­ogy, in­clud­ing smart­phone lo­ca­tion track­ing to mon­i­tor those in quar­an­tine and alert those who had pos­si­ble ex­po­sure to Covid-19 pa­tients, also helped to re­duce the spread.</p>
    <p>ROAD TO ECO­NOMIC RE­COV­ERY</p>
    <p>Com­pared with many economies, Tai­wan’s early sup­pres­sion of the coro­n­avirus has meant its do­mes­tic de­mand is in bet­ter shape to re­cover, notes DBS Bank econ­o­mist Ma Tiey­ing, whose area of re­search in­cludes Tai­wan, South Korea and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>And, as OCBC Bank’s Mr Xie pointed out, the govern­ment’s stim­u­lus mea­sures – in­clud­ing vouch­ers for shop­ping, travel and sport­ing events; pro­mo­tion of do­mes­tic travel; and job sup­port schemes – have also helped to sup­port do­mes­tic con­sump­tion and in­vest­ment sen­ti­ments.</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of for­eign tourists, travel in­dus­try play­ers got in­no­va­tive to at­tract lo­cal tourists. Air­lines started flights to nowhere, with Eva Air of­fer­ing three-hour Hello Kitty-themed flights com­plete with Miche­lin-starred in-flight meals. Cruise com­pa­nies have started three- to four-day is­land-hop­ping cruises with stops at the far-flung Penghu, Kin­men and Matsu is­lands. Th­ese of­fer­ings were well-sub­scribed by travel-starved Tai­wanese, helped by vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has thrown up op­por­tu­ni­ties, par­tic­u­larly in the tech sec­tor. The sup­ply chain di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion of Tai­wanese firms with off­shore op­er­a­tions may also see their re­turn home, noted Ms Ma.</p>
    <p>Mr Kung made it clear that Tai­wan would con­tinue to work to­wards bring­ing back high-end pro­duc­tion while let­ting low-end pro­duc­tion move to places such as Asean coun­tries. It hopes to be­come a hub for higher-end man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus of the tech sec­tor, he told Tai­wan Busi­ness Top­ics, would be on 5G, ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and semi­con­duc­tors.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan, one of the top tar­gets in the world for hack­ers and cy­ber at­tacks, also hopes to turn this vul­ner­a­bil­ity to good use in the cy­ber-se­cu­rity sec­tor, in­clud­ing serv­ing as a test bed for new cy­berde­fence sys­tems. Com­pa­nies that have shown in­ter­est in col­lab­o­rat­ing with the is­land on in­for­ma­tion se­cu­rity in­clude Mi­crosoft, Google and Cisco.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that Tai­wan has demon­strated its enor­mous ca­pa­bil­ity and po­ten­tial in med­i­cal science and tech­nol­ogy dur­ing the pan­demic, Mr Xie sug­gested that its bio­med­i­cal sec­tor could strengthen its ca­pa­bil­ity in man­u­fac­tur­ing med­i­cal equip­ment and put more ef­fort in re­search and de­vel­op­ment and pro­duc­tion of vac­cines and treat­ment.</p>
    <p>HAZ­ARDS AHEAD</p>
    <p>But he added that Tai­wan should pre­vent over-de­pen­dence on any sin­gle market – nearly 40 per cent of its ex­ports go to China and Hong Kong – and in this re­gard, it should ac­cel­er­ate its new south-bound pol­icy of in­creas­ing eco­nomic and other ex­changes with South and South-east Asia and Aus­trala­sia.</p>
    <p>In or­der to pro­mote trade, he sug­gested that the is­land seek free trade agree­ments with trad­ing part­ners more ac­tively. Tai­wan is pur­su­ing such deals with coun­tries in­clud­ing the United States and Aus­tralia. In re­cent days, it an­nounced the eas­ing of re­stric­tions on US beef and pork im­ports, stick­ing points that pre­vented ne­go­ti­a­tions for a free trade agree­ment be­tween the two sides.</p>
    <p>But while things are look­ing up for Tai­wan eco­nom­i­cally, pit­falls re­main that could de­rail its eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>One of th­ese is geopol­i­tics, in­clud­ing the rise in ten­sions be­tween the US and China, par­tic­u­larly in the tech area, which could hurt Tai­wanese firms that are highly in­volved in the US-China sup­ply chain.</p>
    <p>De­te­ri­o­rat­ing cross-strait re­la­tions could also dam­age trade and in­vest­ment ties with main­land China.</p>
    <p>An­other risk is the resur­gence of Covid-19. Geopol­i­tics and big-power play are out of Tai­wan’s con­trol. But pre­vent­ing a Covid-19 resur­gence is within its power and it will do well to do so. As its own ex­pe­ri­ence of the pan­demic has shown, tak­ing care of pub­lic health is key to pre­serv­ing eco­nomic well-be­ing.</p>
