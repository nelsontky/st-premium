    <p>Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional’s Quan­tum of the Seas yes­ter­day be­came the sec­ond ship to start cruises to nowhere from Sin­ga­pore, with stepped-up safety pro­to­cols to keep Covid-19 at bay.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows Gent­ing Cruise Line’s World Dream, which launched Sin­ga­pore’s first cruises to nowhere on Nov 6 amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Th­ese round-trip cruises with­out ports of call are tak­ing place un­der a pi­lot pro­gramme an­nounced in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Royal Caribbean will have up to two cruises a week, de­part­ing on Mon­days and Thurs­days, with tick­ets start­ing at $374 per per­son for a three-night cruise.</p>
    <p>The first voyage, a four-night cruise car­ry­ing more than 1,300 peo­ple, left yes­ter­day at 9pm. Its sec­ond, a three-night cruise leav­ing at 9pm on Mon­day, will carry more than 1,700 pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>The Quan­tum of the Seas can serve up to 2,000 guests at full ca­pac­ity dur­ing the pan­demic, half of its usual of over 4,000 pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>“We want to trial our prod­uct, and the de­mand is there, as we are al­ready 99 per cent sold out for most of De­cem­ber,” said Ms Angie Stephen, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for Asia-Pa­cific at Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Tick­ets for next month are al­ready 50 per cent sold out, she said, adding that de­mand has “ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions”.</p>
    <p>She ex­pects the com­pany will see a surge in book­ings for the Chi­nese New Year pe­riod in Fe­bru­ary, as well as the March school hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Board­ing be­gan at 2pm yes­ter­day in stag­gered time pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>As part of health and safety mea­sures, pas­sen­gers were re­quired to take a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) Covid-19 test be­fore ar­riv­ing at the Ma­rina Bay Cruise Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>This pro­ce­dure dif­fers from that for Gent­ing’s World Dream cruise, which in­volved pas­sen­gers tak­ing an anti­gen rapid test for Covid-19 at the cruise cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Those board­ing the Royal Caribbean cruise had their board­ing passes scanned. Their suit­cases un­der­went a dis­in­fec­tion process called elec­tro­static fog­ging.</p>
    <p>Apart from deep san­i­ta­tion be­tween sail­ings, the ship’s cor­ri­dors and pub­lic ar­eas are dis­in­fected daily.</p>
    <p>Fre­quently touched ar­eas in lifts, es­ca­la­tors, stair­ways and prom­e­nades are cleaned ev­ery two hours.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers must fol­low safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures at all en­ter­tain­ment and din­ing venues, with lim­its on ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Mask wear­ing is manda­tory, and pas­sen­gers must use the TraceTo­gether mobile ap­pli­ca­tion or carry their to­ken with them.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers will be given a full run of the ship’s ameni­ties, but book­ings must be made in ad­vance for key at­trac­tions such as the RipCord by iFly, a sky-div­ing sim­u­la­tor in a glass cham­ber, and the FlowRider, a surf sim­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>Reser­va­tions are also needed for the North Star, which of­fers a 15-minute spin in a glass cap­sule that rises al­most 100m above the sea to pro­vide a 360-de­gree view.</p>
    <p>If a pos­i­tive Covid-19 case is de­tected dur­ing the cruise, the Quan­tum of the Seas has a hospi­tal on board with a PCR-test­ing lab­o­ra­tory and in­ten­sive care units equipped with ven­ti­la­tors, where cases can be treated.</p>
    <p>“With all of th­ese pro­to­cols on board, our guests can cruise with con­fi­dence know­ing that safety is the pri­or­ity for Royal Caribbean,” Ms Stephen said, adding that the like­li­hood of a case on board is ex­pected to be “very min­i­mal”, with the var­i­ous mea­sures in place.</p>
