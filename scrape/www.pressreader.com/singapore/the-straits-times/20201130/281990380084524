    <p>Par­a­lympic medal­list and world cham­pion Theresa Goh has sur­mounted a good many chal­lenges over the course of her swim­ming ca­reer.</p>
    <p>But in the midst of Covid-19, the 33-year-old, born with spina bi­fida and paral­ysed f rom the waist down, found her­self stymied by a seem­ingly mod­est foe: a sin­gle kerb step out­side a shop­ping cen­tre.</p>
    <p>To fa­cil­i­tate pan­demic man­age­ment mea­sures, the build­ing had closed off all but one of its en­trances, leav­ing Ms Goh un­able to ac­cess her usual wheelchair­friendly ramp and door en­try.</p>
    <p>With build­ing se­cu­rity un­will­ing to make an ex­cep­tion and open the other en­trance for her, she had to re­sort to ask­ing a stranger to as­sist her over the lone step.</p>
    <p>“It’s not on pur­pose; it’s just that they don’t think about these things,” said Ms Goh.</p>
    <p>Her ex­pe­ri­ence re­flects what other per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties, so­cial ser­vice or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­dus­try pro­fes­sion­als and aca­demics have high­lighted as in­creas­ing dif­fi­cul­ties with ac­cess for those who have mo­bil­ity is­sues.</p>
    <p>They point to bar­ri­ers that were erected in re­sponse to a surge in the pop­u­lar­ity of ac­tive mo­bil­ity de­vices in re­cent years. Com­mon ex­am­ples of such ur­ban de­sign mod­i­fi­ca­tions in­clude bar­ri­ers or bol­lards placed along walk­ways to de­ter reck­less mo­tor­cy­clists, cy­clists and mo­torised per­sonal mo­bil­ity de­vice rid­ers.</p>
    <p>But these end up ham­per­ing wheel­chair ac­cess as well.</p>
    <p>This is­sue of ac­cess has been com­pounded by the pan­demic, as safe man­age­ment mea­sures put in place to re­strict en­try points into var­i­ous ar­eas and build­ings some­times in­ad­ver­tently close off bar­rier-free routes for those with mo­bil­ity chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>A Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity (BCA) spokesman said its Code on Ac­ces­si­bil­ity, which lays out rules and guide­lines for in­fra­struc­ture plan­ning and de­sign, is as in­clu­sive as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The code was in­tro­duced in 1990 and un­der­goes pe­ri­odic re­views, with the lat­est in Jan­uary this year in­volv­ing pub­lic feed­back, in­clud­ing from the Dis­abled Peo­ple’s Associatio­n (DPA) and SPD.</p>
    <p>The spokesman also said BCA would ad­vise town coun­cils to re­move or mod­ify bar­ri­ers along paths or walk­ways in hous­ing es­tates, when­ever it re­ceives pub­lic feed­back on per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties be­ing in­con­ve­nienced.</p>
    <p>TRADE-OFFS</p>
    <p>Town coun­cils and MPs whom The Straits Times spoke to said there was no sin­gle so­lu­tion to meet all needs.</p>
    <p>“Say you first cre­ate a bar­ri­er­free ac­cess ramp to make it convenient for those with dis­abil­i­ties,” said East Coast GRC MP Ch­eryl Chan. “Then, un­for­tu­nately, to pro­tect them from speed­ing cy­clists and what­not, you add some­thing that ends up in­con­ve­nienc­ing the very group you’re try­ing to help.”</p>
    <p>Tan­jong Pa­gar GRC MP Joan Pereira noted that Sin­ga­pore is a densely pop­u­lated city with a lot of shared spa­ces, re­sult­ing in trade­offs for ev­ery de­ci­sion made on in­fra­struc­ture and fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Wheel­chair users and dis­abil­ity ad­vo­cates said they un­der­stood it was a balanc­ing act for the au­thor­i­ties. Still, they ob­served that BCA guide­lines – for ex­am­ple, that gaps be­tween bol­lards and bar­ri­ers should be at least 90cm and 120cm re­spec­tively – were not uni­formly ad­hered to across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>DPA pres­i­dent Richard Kup­pusamy said the vis­ually im­paired and those in bulkier elec­tric wheel­chairs could strug­gle to nav­i­gate these struc­tures re­gard­less.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers at the in­ter­sec­tion of ur­ban­i­sa­tion and so­ci­ol­ogy said such de­signs qual­i­fied as in­stances of “hos­tile” or “de­fen­sive” architectu­re.</p>
    <p>While help­ing to en­sure pub­lic safety – in Sin­ga­pore’s case, from the haz­ards posed by er­rant rid­ers – they could also lead to the marginal­i­sa­tion of vul­ner­a­ble groups like those with dis­abil­i­ties, and un­der­mine on­go­ing ef­forts to bet­ter in­te­grate them in­stead.</p>
    <p>Said As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Jef­frey Chan of the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign: “These de­signs do not be­long to any thought­ful and con­sci­en­tious so­ci­ety… (They) be­long to a city char­ac­terised by fear and dis­trust.”</p>
    <p>Said Ms Chan, the MP: “Partly be­cause of all this in­con­ve­nience of get­ting around... it has be­come an added bar­rier for per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties to come out and min­gle around the community. There needs to be quite a com­pre­hen­sive re­view of how we build fa­cil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>EM­PA­THY FIRST</p>
    <p>Spe­cific to Covid-19 mea­sures such as the clos­ing off of most en­trances in pub­lic build­ings, Prof Chan said such mea­sures cre­ate more ob­sta­cles for peo­ple with mo­bil­ity is­sues, and might dis­cour­age them from leav­ing their homes. “This may not be good for their men­tal and phys­i­o­log­i­cal health,” he stressed.</p>
    <p>Mr Kup­pusamy, a trained ar­chi­tect and wheel­chair user him­self, said build­ings could bet­ter dis­sem­i­nate in­for­ma­tion to the pub­lic on changed ac­cess points.</p>
    <p>He also urged BCA to “put its foot down” and en­force its Code on Ac­ces­si­bil­ity on top of Covid-19 re­quire­ments and guide­lines.</p>
    <p>The key is to be em­pa­thetic to all users, as ar­chi­tects and ur­ban plan­ners try to jug­gle community needs with safety and se­cu­rity con­di­tions, said Mr Rodeo Cruzado Ca­bil­lan, prin­ci­pal de­signer at the Sin­ga­pore-head­quar­tered in­fra­struc­ture con­sul­tancy CPG.</p>
    <p>“In to­day’s pan­demic cri­sis con­text, ac­com­plish­ing this bal­ance is all the more cru­cial, as there are com­mu­nal chal­lenges that many cities and users of pub­lic open spa­ces are fac­ing,” he added.</p>
    <p>These sen­ti­ments were echoed by dis­abil­ity wel­fare groups, with SPD chief ex­ec­u­tive Ab­hi­manyau Pal say­ing: “We hope to progress to a stage where new en­vi­ron­ments are built hav­ing all needs con­sid­ered rather than as an af­ter­thought.”</p>
