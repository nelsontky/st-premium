    <p>•</p>
    <p>With just three more tour­na­ments be­fore the sea­son-end­ing CME Group Tour Cham­pi­onship, Danielle Kang is in a good place.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can leads the Race to CME Globe rank­ings, with the win­ner earn­ing a US$1.5 mil­lion (S$2.03 mil­lion) cheque – the largest sin­gle prize in women’s golf his­tory.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing al­ready won the LPGA Drive On Cham­pi­onship in Toledo, Ohio in Au­gust, Kang is in the frame for the an­other Drive On Cham­pi­onship ti­tle, this time in Greens­boro, Ge­or­gia.</p>
    <p>She fired a seven-un­der 65 on Thurs­day to share the first-round lead with fel­low Amer­i­can Jen­nifer Song.</p>
    <p>Kang, twice a win­ner since the Tour’s re­turn from a near six­month Covid-19-in­duced hia­tus, and Song, seek­ing her first LPGA ti­tle in more than a decade, were one stroke ahead of com­pa­triot Ally McDon­ald at Reynolds Lake Oconee.</p>
    <p>World No. 5 Kang, who is the topranked player in the field, is up­beat about her chances.</p>
    <p>“I think I know the golf course a lit­tle bit bet­ter,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I’ve only played it once tech­ni­cally so it’s still very new, but I just tried to work on some pace drills on the greens and fig­ure out the type of grass around here. I feel good about to­day.”</p>
    <p>The event was cre­ated to fill a gap be­tween US events af­ter the LPGA’s usual Asian swing was wiped out by the pan­demic and al­le­vi­at­ing the fi­nan­cial pres­sures due to a string of events be­ing can­celled this year, some­thing Kang is thank­ful for.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s just re­ally ex­cit­ing that the LPGA Drive On could hap­pen dur­ing this break,” she said. “It’s been cool.</p>
    <p>“It’s def­i­nitely good to have a good start on Thurs­day. Still got three more rounds left and I have a lot of work to do.”</p>
    <p>She is well aware that the chas­ing pack has some big names, with for­mer world No. 1 and two-time Ma­jor cham­pion Ariya Ju­tanu­garn (67), 2018 ANA In­spi­ra­tion win­ner Pernilla Lind­berg (68) and Bianca Pag­dan­ganan (68) all in the mix.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s Ariya, in par­tic­u­lar, is ea­ger to end her drought, with the last of her 10 LPGA ti­tles com­ing at the 2018 Ladies Scot­tish Open.</p>
    <p>“Didn’t ex­pect to shoot it low at all, be­cause like soon as I saw the course, I feel like this course go­ing to be tough,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We play pretty long and the green is pretty tough.”</p>
    <p>For­mer world No. 1 Ly­dia Ko of New Zealand shared the early lead on three un­der be­fore tak­ing a triple bo­gey at the par-three 17th, fall­ing back af­ter find­ing wa­ter off the tee on her way to a 71.</p>
