    <p>• Fe­male and minority ac­tors are al­most fairly rep­re­sented in United States tele­vi­sion se­ries, but re­main shut out of key be­hind-the-cam­era roles, in­clud­ing ex­ec­u­tive jobs, a ma­jor new study found last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The Hol­ly­wood Diver­sity Re­port from the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Los An­ge­les (UCLA), found that 35 per cent of l ead roles went to minority ac­tors on ca­ble shows last year.</p>
    <p>Mi­nori­ties rep­re­sent about 40 per cent of the US pop­u­la­tion. Women ac­counted for 45 per cent of lead roles on ca­ble, climb­ing to 49 per cent on stream­ing.</p>
    <p>But mi­nori­ties ac­counted for just 8 per cent of stu­dio ex­ec­u­tive chair and chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer roles, and women just un­der one-third.</p>
    <p>“There has been a lot of progress for women and peo­ple of colour in front of the cam­era,” said Pro­fes­sor Dar­nell Hunt, so­cial sci­ences dean at UCLA and co-au­thor of the study.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, there has not been the same level of progress be­hind the cam­era. Most no­tably in the ex­ec­u­tive suite, there has been very lit­tle change since we be­gan com­pil­ing data five years ago.</p>
    <p>“That’s very telling, par­tic­u­larly in light of our cur­rent racial reck­on­ing.”</p>
    <p>The re­port comes dur­ing a year in which anti-racism Black Lives Mat­ter protests sparked by the po­lice killings of Mr Ge­orge Floyd and Ms Bre­onna Tay­lor have ex­posed the na­tion’s racial di­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>Shows in­clud­ing Watch­men, a dark comic-book satire tack­ling prej­u­dice that won 11 Em­mys last month, have in­ten­si­fied that de­bate as well as cre­at­ing more roles for black and minority ac­tors.</p>
    <p>Of the more than 100 act­ing nom­i­na­tions in the Em­mys’ se­ries, lim­ited se­ries and TV movie cat­e­gories, more than a third of them went to black ac­tors – a new record.</p>
    <p>Among them were Billy Porter (Pose), Ster­ling K. Brown (This Is Us and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel), Issa Rae (In­se­cure) and Regina King (Watch­men).</p>
    <p>But while black and multiracia­l ac­tors were over-rep­re­sented among ca­ble scripted lead roles last year, Latino, Asian and Na­tive Amer­i­cans again fell short. And white men still over­whelm­ingly dom­i­nate top-level TV ex­ec­u­tive jobs.</p>
    <p>Study co-au­thor Ana-Christina Ramon warned that the lack of peo­ple of colour at ex­ec­u­tive lev­els was “prob­lem­atic” be­cause “story lines may lack au­then­tic­ity or will be writ­ten stereo­typ­i­cally or even ‘race­less’ if the dis­par­ity con­tin­ues”.</p>
    <p>The re­port fo­cuses on TV se­ries broad­cast between 2017 and last year. Its find­ings largely mir­ror the trends seen in a sim­i­lar UCLA re­port on the Hol­ly­wood film in­dus­try re­leased in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
