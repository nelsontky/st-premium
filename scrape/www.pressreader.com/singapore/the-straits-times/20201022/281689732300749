    <p>CHICAGO/WASH­ING­TON • The US trial of As­traZeneca’s Covid-19 vac­cine is ex­pected to re­sume as early as this week af­ter the United States Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) has com­pleted its re­view of a se­ri­ous ill­ness in a study par­tic­i­pant, ac­cord­ing to four sources.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca’s late-stage US trial has been on hold since Sept 6, af­ter a par­tic­i­pant in the firm’s Bri­tish trial fell ill with what was sus­pected to be a rare spinal in­flam­ma­tory dis­or­der called trans­verse myeli­tis.</p>
    <p>The sources, who were briefed on the mat­ter but asked to re­main anony­mous, said they have been told the trial could re­sume later this week. It was un­clear how the FDA would char­ac­terise the ill­ness. The agency de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The FDA is re­quir­ing re­searchers con­duct­ing the trial to add in­for­ma­tion about the in­ci­dent to con­sent forms signed by study par­tic­i­pants, ac­cord­ing to one of the sources.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish reg­u­la­tory of­fi­cials pre­vi­ously re­viewed the ill­ness and de­ter­mined that there was in­suf­fi­cient ev­i­dence to say for cer­tain that it was or was not re­lated to the vac­cine. It per­mit­ted the trial to re­sume in Bri­tain, ac­cord­ing to a draft of the up­dated con­sent form.</p>
    <p>“In this case, af­ter con­sid­er­ing the in­for­ma­tion, the in­de­pen­dent re­view­ers and MHRA (Medicines and Health­care Prod­ucts Reg­u­la­tory Agency) rec­om­mended that vac­ci­na­tions should con­tinue,” the draft form stated. “Close mon­i­tor­ing of the af­fected in­di­vid­ual and other par­tic­i­pants will be con­tin­ued.”</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors in Brazil, In­dia and South Africa also pre­vi­ously al­lowed As­traZeneca to re­sume its vac­cine tri­als there.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca, which is de­vel­op­ing the vac­cine with Ox­ford Uni­ver­sity re­searchers, had been seen as a front run­ner in the race to pro­duce a vac­cine for Covid-19 un­til its tri­als were put on hold to in­ves­ti­gate the ill­ness. Early data from large-scale tri­als in the United States of vac­cines from Pfizer and Moderna are ex­pected some time next month.</p>
    <p>John­son & John­son (J&J) last week paused its Phase III Covid-19 vac­cine trial to in­ves­ti­gate an un­ex­plained ill­ness in a study par­tic­i­pant.</p>
    <p>J&J noted last week that its “study pause” was vol­un­tary. By con­trast, As­traZeneca’s trial is on reg­u­la­tory hold, which is im­posed by the health au­thor­i­ties.</p>
