    <p>• West Ham United boss David Moyes is still call­ing the shots at the Premier League club de­spite hav­ing to self-iso­late af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Ham­mers thumped Wolver­hamp­ton Wanderers 4-0 on Sun­day, with Moyes pulling the strings from home.</p>
    <p>“There were a lot of phone calls with David, (as­sis­tant coach) Stu­art Pearce was in­un­dated. David picked the team and con­trolled the sub­sti­tu­tions,” stand-in boss Alan Irvine told BT Sport.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Irvine was also in charge of the Ham­mers’ 5-1 win over third-tier Hull City in the</p>
    <p>League Cup third round last week.</p>
    <p>Moyes is set to re­turn to the train­ing ground on Thurs­day, en­sur­ing his 100 per cent record work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>The win equalled his big­gest vic­tory as Ham­mers man­ager – a 4-0 rout over Bournemout­h on New Year’s Day.</p>
    <p>That win in Jan­uary also marked the last time his side recorded a clean sheet at the Lon­don Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>The wel­come boost, how­ever, may have caused him some added stress due to the ex­cel­lent per­for­mance of De­clan Rice.</p>
    <p>Their mid­field linch­pin, who has been linked with a move to</p>
    <p>Chelsea, put in an­other stel­lar dis­play, and West Ham will have a tough time hang­ing on to one of their key play­ers with the trans­fer win­dow clos­ing on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“De­clan (Rice) is ex­tremely happy. He was cap­tain to­day, he is not some­body with other things on his mind,” Irvine said be­fore sug­gest­ing that any trans­fers at West Ham might in­volve play­ers ar­riv­ing, rather than de­part­ing.</p>
    <p>Eng­land in­ter­na­tional Rice re­vealed he “couldn’t be any hap­pier for the staff who were here tonight”, given the cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>“I know they’ve been on Zoom calls all week and the man­ager’s been get­ting his points across to them, which they’ve been putting onto the train­ing pitch,” the 21-year-old said.</p>
    <p>“They’ve stepped into the man­ager’s shoes bril­liantly. It’s a col­lec­tive ef­fort and I’m de­lighted for the man­age­ment tonight.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure he’ll be buzzing.”</p>
