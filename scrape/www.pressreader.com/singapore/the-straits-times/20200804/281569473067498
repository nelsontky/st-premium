    <p>Bri­ton James Cor­den is re­port­edly in line to re­place Ellen De­Generes as host of her day­time talk show, which has been hit by al­le­ga­tions of bul­ly­ing and sex­ual ha­rass­ment. Cor­den, host of The Late Late Show on Amer­i­can net­work CBS, has long been seen as a pos­si­ble suc­ces­sor to De­Generes, The Sun has re­ported.</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • As The Ellen De­Generes Show be­comes in­creas­ingly em­broiled in scan­dal, James Cor­den, host of CBS’ The Late Late Show, is re­port­edly i n talks to re­place her.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing an in­sider, The Sun re­ported last Satur­day that Cor­den, 41, has long been seen as the “longterm suc­ces­sor” to 62-year-old De­Generes even be­fore al­le­ga­tions about the show’s toxic work en­vi­ron­ment sur­faced.</p>
    <p>Cor­den, a Bri­ton, has risen to fame with the pop­u­lar­ity of his show, which i ncludes seg­ments such as Car­pool Karaoke, which in­volves him and a mu­si­cal guest singing along to the lat­ter’s songs dur­ing a car ride.</p>
    <p>Drop The Mic, a seg­ment in which Cor­den and guests en­gage in rap bat­tles, has also proven pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>The source told The Sun: “James and his team have been trail­blaz­ers in mod­ern TV, tak­ing the once con­sid­ered grave­yard chat show slot into a cut­ting-edge for­mat with huge on­line, so­cial me­dia and global recog­ni­tion.”</p>
    <p>The source added that Cor­den al­ready “has a huge, de­voted au­di­ence, global ap­peal and is loved by Hol­ly­wood”.</p>
    <p>“Re­plac­ing Ellen was al­ways go­ing to be a tough chal­lenge, but he is a nat­u­ral fit and easy tran­si­tion. James would freshen up day­time and with a free hand would be al­lowed to build a new af­ter­noon era.”</p>
    <p>Trou­bles for Ellen De­Generes be­gan last month, when Buz­zfeed News pub­lished an ex­plo­sive re­port ex­pos­ing the re­al­i­ties of work­ing on set at The Ellen De­Generes Show (2003 to present).</p>
    <p>Show pro­duc­ers Warner Bros Tele­vi­sion sub­se­quently con­ducted an in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion into com­plaints rang­ing from bul­ly­ing to racism among pro­duc­tion staff. It found that while “not all of the al­le­ga­tions were cor­rob­o­rated, we are dis­ap­pointed that the pri­mary find­ings of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion in­di­cated some de­fi­cien­cies re­lated to the show’s day-to-day man­age­ment”.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, De­Generes apol­o­gised to the staff of her show, say­ing she was tak­ing steps to im­prove the cul­ture on set.</p>
    <p>But just hours af­ter her apol­ogy, Buz­zfeed News ran an ar­ti­cle in which dozens of for­mer staff al­leged that sex­ual ha­rass­ment and mis­con­duct by the show’s top ex­ec­u­tive pro­duc­ers were ram­pant.</p>
