    <p>Mo­torists driv­ing past three gantries on the Cen­tral Ex­press­way (CTE) dur­ing morn­ing and evening peak hours will have to pay Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing (ERP) fees again from next Mon­day af­ter en­joy­ing a three-month re­prieve.</p>
    <p>The re­in­state­ment of ERP fees at these parts is due to traf­fic jams that were ob­served there dur­ing peak hours, the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But mo­torists go­ing past other ERP gantries along the CTE and else­where is­land­wide do not need to pay any charges as gen­eral traf­fic con­di­tions re­main op­ti­mal, LTA added.</p>
    <p>It announced the changes af­ter com­plet­ing its sec­ond re­view of ERP rates since the lift­ing of cir­cuit breaker mea­sures on June 2.</p>
    <p>Mo­torists have not had to pay ERP charges since April 6, as ac­tiv­ity across the is­land slowed down due to cir­cuit breaker reg­u­la­tions to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>But from next Mon­day, mo­torists driv­ing in the south­bound di­rec­tion on the CTE be­tween 8am and 9am will be charged $1 at the gantry be­fore Brad­dell Road.</p>
    <p>Mo­torists driv­ing on the CTE in the north­bound di­rec­tion be­tween 6pm and 7pm will also have to pay a $1 fee if they drive past the set of two gantries lo­cated af­ter the Pan-Is­land Ex­press­way.</p>
    <p>“As eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties grad­u­ally re­sume, traf­fic vol­ume has been in­creas­ing as more people re­turn to work­places and schools,” said LTA.</p>
    <p>“Based on LTA’s mon­i­tor­ing of traf­fic con­di­tions from end June to early July 2020, traf­fic speeds have re­mained op­ti­mal on all ar­te­rial roads and most ex­press­ways, ex­cept for some time pe­ri­ods on the (CTE).”</p>
    <p>LTA said that it will con­tinue to mon­i­tor traf­fic speeds and con­ges­tion lev­els closely. It will an­nounce the out­come of the next re­view in the fourth week of Au­gust, and changes, if any, will take ef­fect on Aug 31.</p>
    <p>From the next re­view cy­cle on­wards, ERP rate re­views will be con­ducted once ev­ery five weeks, up from the four weeks cur­rently. The fre­quency of the re­view will be ad­justed based on the ground sit­u­a­tion, said LTA.</p>
