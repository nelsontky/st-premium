    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Soul, a new an­i­mated pic­ture from Walt Dis­ney’s Pixar stu­dio, will by­pass the­atres and ap­pear in­stead on the com­pany’s Dis­ney+ stream­ing ser­vice, in the lat­est set­back for cin­e­mas des­per­ate for new movies to show.</p>
    <p>The film will be­gin stream­ing on Christ­mas Day, Dis­ney said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>While Soul will ap­pear ex­clu­sively on Dis­ney+ in the United States and Europe, it will be re­leased in cin­e­mas in coun­tries where the stream­ing ser­vice is not avail­able.</p>
    <p>With con­sumers, es­pe­cially in the US, re­luc­tant to go to the­atres dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Hol­ly­wood has strug­gled with ways to re­lease its grow­ing in­ven­tory of big-bud­get films, leav­ing cin­e­mas with few ma­jor pic­tures to show.</p>
    <p>Some big films, in­clud­ing Metro-Gold­wyn-Mayer’s new James Bond fea­ture No Time To Die, have been de­layed. Oth­ers, such as Trolls World Tour from Com­cast’s Uni­ver­sal Pic­tures, were made avail­able on­line for pur­chase.</p>
    <p>AT&T’s Warner Bros re­leased di­rec­tor Christo­pher Nolan’s film Tenet in the­atres, only to see weak box­of­fice rev­enue in North Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Last month, Dis­ney made its live-ac­tion re­make of Mu­lan avail­able to stream­ing cus­tomers for an ad­di­tional US$30 (S$40). While the com­pany has not re­leased sales re­sults for that film, it has not been hailed as a great com­mer­cial suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Un­like Mu­lan, Soul will be avail­able at no ad­di­tional cost to Dis­ney+ cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney has al­ready gone the di­rect-to-stream­ing route sev­eral times this year, in­clud­ing a much cel­e­brated re­lease of Hamil­ton on July 3.</p>
    <p>For Amer­i­can chains such as AMC En­ter­tain­ment Hold­ings, the big­gest the­atre cir­cuit, this year’s cal­en­dar has few big movies left on tap.</p>
    <p>Uni­ver­sal plans to re­lease The Croods: A New Age late next month. Warner Bros has one big De­cem­ber re­lease: Won­der Woman 1984. Soul was orig­i­nally sched­uled to hit cin­e­mas on Nov 20.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney+, which launched in Novem­ber last year, is a US$7-a-month stream­ing ser­vice that al­ready has more than 60 mil­lion sub­scribers.</p>
    <p>Soul tells the story of a mid­dle-school band teacher, voiced by ac­tor Jamie Foxx, who gets to play at the best jazz club in town. But be­fore he can, fate takes him on a crit­i­cal de­tour to an­other world.</p>
    <p>“A new orig­i­nal Pixar film is al­ways a spe­cial oc­ca­sion, and this truly heart­warm­ing and hu­mor­ous story about hu­man con­nec­tion and find­ing one’s place in the world will be a treat for fam­i­lies to en­joy to­gether this hol­i­day sea­son,” Dis­ney chief ex­ec­u­tive Bob Chapek said in a state­ment.</p>
