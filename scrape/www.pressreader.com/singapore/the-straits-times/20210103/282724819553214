    <p>“The num­ber of things that are true for ev­ery­one in fi­nance is small; every­thing else is just fig­ur­ing out how much risk you want to take and what you want out of life, which is dif­fer­ent for ev­ery­one,” said Mr Mor­gan Housel, author of The Psy­chol­ogy Of Money.</p>
    <p>In­deed, ev­ery­one’s port­fo­lio should be dif­fer­ent be­cause we all have dif­fer­ent ob­jec­tives, dif­fer­ent in­vest­ment hori­zons, dif­fer­ent liq­uid­ity needs and dif­fer­ent risk tol­er­ance, among other things.</p>
    <p>All else be­ing equal, those with a longer in­vest­ment hori­zon, lower liq­uid­ity needs and higher tol­er­ance for volatil­ity can al­lo­cate a higher pro­por­tion of their port­fo­lio to equities.</p>
    <p>And based on the long his­tory of mar­ket data, port­fo­lios with higher al­lo­ca­tion to equities have higher re­turns in the long run.</p>
    <p>Let’s say you’ve set aside enough money to last you for at least a year, even if you don’t earn any in­come in the next 12 months. You can then put the rest of your sav­ings to work for your re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing your re­tire­ment date is about 20 years from now. Then you have a solid 20 years to let your money grow.</p>
    <p>Af­ter read­ing a lot of fi­nance lit­er­a­ture, you’ve de­cided to al­lo­cate 20 per cent of your ex­tra cash to tech­nol­ogy or growth stocks in the</p>
    <p>United States, 40 per cent to lead­ing com­pa­nies from the US, Europe and Asia and 25 per cent to value stocks in Asia, be­cause this strat­egy works best here. The re­main­ing 15 per cent, you’ve de­cided to put in macro funds.</p>
    <p>Macro funds al­low the fund man­agers to trade in a wide ar­ray of in­stru­ments, from fu­tures to op­tions to cur­ren­cies, and they can em­ploy var­i­ous strate­gies, from long, to short, to un­der­writ­ing cer­tain po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>The gen­eral i nten­tion of i nvestors for in­clud­ing macro funds in their port­fo­lio is so that this por­tion can yield un­cor­re­lated re­turns to the rest of the port­fo­lios. If mar­kets are down, but the macro funds short the mar­kets, then they can gen­er­ate pos­i­tive re­turns.</p>
    <p>Next is se­lect­ing the funds to give you the ex­po­sure you want. In your equities por­tion, you can of course pick your own stocks. There are a few draw­backs of pick­ing your own stocks.</p>
    <p>If you have too few stocks in your port­fo­lio, you are ex­pos­ing your port­fo­lio to spe­cific in­di­vid­ual com­pany risks. Or if you do not have the time or interest or ex­per­tise to pick the stocks, then it be­comes a chore. That’s not go­ing to make you happy be­cause hav­ing con­trol over our time is what di­rectly con­tributes to our level of hap­pi­ness. Hence, an easy op­tion is to buy into funds.</p>
    <p>But there are thou­sands of funds out there. How do you go about se­lect­ing the funds to en­trust your hard-earned sav­ings to?</p>
    <p>PICK­ING THE RIGHT FUND</p>
    <p>First step, short­list all the funds with the strat­egy and mar­ket ex­po­sure you want.</p>
    <p>Next, com­pare their track record. As­cer­tain where the dif­fer­ence in re­turns arises. Is it be­cause of the fees charged? Numer­ous stud­ies show that fees are the most proven pre­dic­tor of fu­ture fund re­turns – so the lower the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>A small dif­fer­ence in fees com­pounds over the long term, and makes a huge dif­fer­ence to your port­fo­lio value over time.</p>
    <p>Take $100,000 i nvested i nto three funds that yield 6 per cent a year for 20 years – the only dif­fer­ence is the on­go­ing fee, re­spec­tively 0.25 per cent, 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent a year. At the end of 20 years, the first port­fo­lio is about $15,000 higher than the se­cond one, and about $43,000 higher than the third one.</p>
    <p>A fund’s fees or ex­pense ra­tio may dif­fer based on the strat­egy.</p>
    <p>Ac­tively man­aged funds are gen­er­ally more ex­pen­sive than pas­sive funds, which track the mar­kets by in­vest­ing in bench­mark in­dex stocks. Af­ter ac­count­ing for fees, many ac­tively man­aged funds have been found to un­der­per­form their re­spec­tive in­dexes. This has re­sulted in the ex­plod­ing pop­u­lar­ity of pas­sive funds.</p>
    <p>In try­ing to make them­selves more at­trac­tive to in­vestors, ac­tive funds have been re­duc­ing their fees. Mean­while, as more in­vestors flock to pas­sive funds like in­dex funds or ex­change-traded funds (ETFs), the funds en­joy economies of scale and are thus able to lower their fees fur­ther. The happy re­sult is that fees charged by fund man­agers across all strate­gies have been on the down trend.</p>
    <p>Fees are also im­por­tant as they are the in­cen­tives that mo­ti­vate the be­hav­iour of fund man­agers. Those who are paid a cer­tain per­cent­age of the fund as fees will be in­cen­tivised to grow their fund size.</p>
    <p>The big­ger the fund size, the big­ger the fees. Mean­while, there are funds that are paid only for their per­for­mance. For these fund man­agers, their in­ter­ests are more aligned with the in­vestors and they are mo­ti­vated to con­struct a port­fo­lio that is more re­silient and, in their view, has a higher prob­a­bil­ity of gen­er­at­ing pos­i­tive re­turns.</p>
    <p>With more and more funds glob­ally flow­ing into in­dex funds or ETFs, the valu­a­tion of in­dex stocks has be­come el­e­vated. There may be pock­ets of op­por­tu­ni­ties in the mar­kets among non-in­dex stocks. If you want to get ex­po­sure to that seg­ment, what should you look out for in a fund, be­sides fees?</p>
    <p>CHECK THE TRACK RECORD</p>
    <p>This is the next most im­por­tant fac­tor. The track record of a fund should be re­viewed vis-a-vis other funds with the same strat­egy and ge­o­graphic fo­cus, as well as the per­for­mance of the gen­eral mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Long-run per­for­mance over a full busi­ness cy­cle is al­ways pre­ferred to short-run per­for­mance. Luck can play a role in short-term re­turns and may not be re­peat­able. And fo­cus es­pe­cially on how the fund per­formed dur­ing times of dis­tress.</p>
    <p>Next, ask: Is the track record re­peat­able? For you to be able to an­swer that, you need to un­der­stand the in­vest­ment process. Is the fund re­liant on one star man­ager? If so, what hap­pens if the star man­ager leaves?</p>
    <p>How do the fund man­agers go about pick­ing stocks? Do the process and se­lec­tion cri­te­ria make sense to you? Or is it a black box? If so, what are the un­der­ly­ing prin­ci­ples un­der­pin­ning the de­ci­sions of the black box?</p>
    <p>Closely re­lated to track record is the risk as­sumed by the fund to gen­er­ate its re­turns. As in an in­di­vid­ual or a com­pany, over­lever­ag­ing is the key risk of a fund. This is es­pe­cially per­ti­nent for macro funds, which can use lever­age of more than 20 times.</p>
    <p>Lever­age is a dou­ble-edged sword. It en­hances the re­turns if the bet is right, but cuts very deep and can even be fa­tal if it is wrong. If the mar­kets go up by 2 per cent, a fund that is in­vested in the mar­kets with no lever­age will gen­er­ate 2 per cent re­turn, less fees.</p>
    <p>But if the fund bor­rows or uses in­stru­ments that al­low it to bet five times what it has, then it can re­port a 12 per cent re­turn. The flip side is, with that ex­po­sure, if the mar­ket goes down by 10 per cent, the fund will be down 60 per cent.</p>
    <p>Be­sides lever­age, the way the fund con­structs its port­fo­lio also has a sig­nif­i­cant bear­ing on its risks. Does the fund take con­cen­trated bets, for ex­am­ple on one com­pany? Sim­i­lar to lever­age, a cor­rect big bet will yield hand­some re­turns, a wrong one will be cat­a­strophic. Ask what is the worst-case sce­nario for the fund? Un­der what cir­cum­stances will that sce­nario ma­te­ri­alise?</p>
    <p>To sum­marise, funds al­low you ac­cess to strate­gies, mar­kets, di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and ex­per­tise that may not be read­ily avail­able to you as a re­tail in­vestor. In se­lect­ing funds, the three key things to con­sider are the FTR – fees, track record and risks.</p>
