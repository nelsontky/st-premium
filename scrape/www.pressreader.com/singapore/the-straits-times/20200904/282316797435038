    <p>WASHINGTON • PGA Tour com­mis­sioner Jay Mon­a­han on Wed­nes­day un­veiled a 50-event “su­per sea­son” for the 2020-21 sched­ule, in­clud­ing 14 tour­na­ments can­celled or post­poned due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent cam­paign ends with the Tour Cham­pi­onship that tees off to­day at East Lake in At­lanta, while the new sea­son de­buts with the Safe­way Open in Napa, Cal­i­for­nia, next week.</p>
    <p>The 50-event cal­en­dar, one greater than the orig­i­nal plan for this term, is the PGA’s most am­bi­tious of­fer­ing since there were 51 events played in the 1975 sea­son.</p>
    <p>It fea­tures the Ma­jors back in their tra­di­tional places on the cal­en­dar, with the Mas­ters in April, the PGA Cham­pi­onship in May, the US Open in June and the Bri­tish Open in July just three weeks be­fore the Tokyo 2020 Olympics golf tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>The sched­ule in­cludes 11 events that were wiped out this year, plus the Co­rales Pun­ta­cana Cham­pi­onship in the Do­mini­can Re­pub­lic from Sept 24-27 as well as the CJ Cup and the Zozo Cham­pi­onship, which have shifted from South Korea and Ja­pan re­spec­tively to Las Ve­gas and Thou­sand Oaks, Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>It also comes in the wake of a 2019-20 sea­son that was stopped for three months af­ter the first round of the Play­ers Cham­pi­onship in March. Three Ma­jors were reshuf­fled and the Bri­tish Open was can­celled as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>“We are ex­cited to present the full 2020-21 PGA Tour sched­ule – a ‘su­per sea­son’ of 50 fully spon­sored events capped off by the 15th edi­tion of the FedExCup play­offs,” Mon­a­han said.</p>
    <p>The Tour has con­tin­ued over the past three months with­out a ma­jor virus out­break – the last player to test pos­i­tive hap­pened on Aug 1 – but with­out spec­ta­tors at events as well, a ma­jor fi­nan­cial is­sue for tour­na­ments and the cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>“Build­ing our sched­ule is al­ways com­pli­cated, but never more so as over the past sev­eral months as we con­tinue to nav­i­gate chal­lenges brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic,” Mon­a­han added.</p>
    <p>Since the restart in June, spec­ta­tors have been barred and that is a sce­nario that will carry over into next sea­son.</p>
    <p>Con­firm­ing it will be some time be­fore there will be a live gallery, Mon­a­han said: “When we feel like it’s safe to re­turn fans out here, that’s when fans will re­turn.”</p>
