    <p>The lit­tle red dot wants a greener en­ergy mix and is tak­ing mul­ti­ple steps to achieve this – from an elec­tric­ity im­port pi­lot with Malaysia, to soak­ing up more sun­shine at home and in­vest­ing in re­search on emerg­ing low-car­bon tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing yes­ter­day laid out the steps that Sin­ga­pore will take to be­come a “bright green spark” – where ideas and ap­pli­ca­tions can help to cre­ate more sus­tain­able liv­ing en­vi­ron­ments.</p>
    <p>For one thing, Sin­ga­pore hopes to tap green en­ergy from around the re­gion through re­gional power grids. The ground­work for this will be laid through an elec­tric­ity im­port trial with Malaysia over two years.</p>
    <p>“We will kick this off by im­port­ing 100MW of elec­tric­ity over a trial pe­riod of two years,” Mr Chan said at the open­ing of the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week (SIEW), an en­ergy con­fer­ence. This will make up about 1.5 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s peak elec­tric­ity de­mand.</p>
    <p>“This will al­low the re­gion to share the green en­ergy sources that dif­fer­ent coun­tries may have,” he added.</p>
    <p>The En­ergy Mar­ket Au­thor­ity (EMA), an agency un­der Mr Chan’s min­istry, plans to is­sue a re­quest for pro­posal by March next year. Elec­tric­ity im­ports could be­gin as early as the end of next year, via the ex­ist­ing elec­tric­ity in­ter­con­nec­tor be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>EMA said it prefers to im­port elec­tric­ity f rom re­new­able en­ergy sources. “Po­ten­tial im­porters will need to spec­ify the sources of their sup­ply, which will be one of the fac­tors that EMA will con­sider in eval­u­at­ing the pro­pos­als,” said a spokesman for the agency.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic will also ramp up its drive to tap more sun­shine here, with a goal of achiev­ing 1.5 gi­gawatt-peak (GWp) of so­lar de­ploy­ment by 2025. This will meet about 2 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s en­ergy de­mand in 2025.</p>
    <p>This is an ac­cel­er­a­tion of the so­lar de­ploy­ment plan that Mr Chan an­nounced at last year’s con­fer­ence, which was to have an in­stalled so­lar ca­pac­ity of 2 GWp by 2030.</p>
    <p>Over the longer term, Sin­ga­pore could also po­ten­tially tap emerg­ing low-car­bon tech­nolo­gies such as us­ing hy­dro­gen as a fuel or de­ploy­ing car­bon cap­ture util­i­sa­tion and stor­age to “suck” planet-warm­ing car­bon diox­ide out of the air.</p>
    <p>EMA said it prefers to im­port elec­tric­ity from re­new­able en­ergy sources... The Re­pub­lic will also ramp up its drive to tap more sun­shine here, with a goal of achiev­ing 1.5 gi­gawatt-peak (GWp) of so­lar de­ploy­ment by 2025. This will meet about 2 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s en­ergy de­mand in 2025.</p>
    <p>Such tech­nolo­gies are still rel­a­tively nascent, said Mr Chan, but the Gov­ern­ment has set aside $49 mil­lion to fund low-car­bon en­ergy re­search and test-bed­ding ef­forts in hy­dro­gen and car­bon cap­ture util­i­sa­tion and stor­age.</p>
    <p>Hy­dro­gen when burned pro­duces water and no green­house gases. If used in large enough amounts, it could sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce de­mand for fos­sil fu­els.</p>
    <p>The new Low-Car­bon En­ergy Re­search Fund­ing Ini­tia­tive in­cludes agen­cies such as the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search, the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board, EMA, the Na­tional Cli­mate Change Sec­re­tar­iat and the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion (NRF).</p>
    <p>NRF chief ex­ec­u­tive Low Teck Seng said that such tech­nolo­gies are es­sen­tial for Sin­ga­pore to achieve its en­ergy and de­car­bon­i­sa­tion goals.</p>
    <p>“Both tech­nolo­gies are still rel­a­tively nascent. More re­search and devel­op­ment is re­quired to in­crease their tech­no­log­i­cal readi­ness and lower their costs in or­der for them to be com­mer­cially vi­able,” said Pro­fes­sor Low.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Su­bodh Mhaisalkar, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s En­ergy Re­search In­sti­tute, said that it is un­likely that Sin­ga­pore will be able to pro­duce “green” hy­dro­gen lo­cally due to its lim­i­ta­tions in har­ness­ing re­new­able en­ergy.</p>
    <p>He said the Re­pub­lic may im­port “green” hy­dro­gen in­stead.</p>
    <p>“Green” hy­dro­gen – con­sid­ered the clean­est form of hy­dro­gen – is pro­duced us­ing so­lar, wind or hy­dro power to split water into oxy­gen and hy­dro­gen.</p>
    <p>“But it is im­por­tant to un­der­stand the en­tire value chain from gen­er­a­tion to stor­age, trans­porta­tion and end use,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s re­search strengths in ma­te­ri­als and process tech­nolo­gies such as catal­y­sis will make it pos­si­ble for the na­tion to make sig­nif­i­cant con­tri­bu­tions to this value chain, he added.</p>
    <p>We will kick this off by im­port­ing 100MW of elec­tric­ity over a trial pe­riod of two years. This will al­low the re­gion to share the green en­ergy sources that dif­fer­ent coun­tries may have.</p>
