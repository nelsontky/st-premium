    <p>More than 36,000 job and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties are cur­rently on of­fer on the na­tional jobs por­tal, MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg, in­clud­ing highly coveted roles such as busi­ness an­a­lysts and project man­agers.</p>
    <p>Over one in 10 po­si­tions posted on the por­tal pay more than $10,000 a month, four in 10 of­fer $5,000 and up monthly, and about a third of them are per­ma­nent roles, a check by The Sun­day Times shows.</p>
    <p>Many po­si­tions are in the tech­nol­ogy and fi­nan­cial sec­tors, where some firms are still ex­pand­ing their op­er­a­tions de­spite the pan­demicin­duced down­turn.</p>
    <p>These fall un­der the am­bit of the SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age un­veiled in May, which aims to cre­ate some 100,000 jobs, trainee­ships and skills train­ing places for lo­cals.</p>
    <p>MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg caters to all lo­cal job seek­ers, Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG) told The Sun­day Times, not­ing that the bulk of the job post­ings are at the pro­fes­sional, man­ager and ex­ec­u­tive (PME) level, since other job plat­forms fo­cus on list­ing non-PME jobs. It also pointed out that job list­ings on the por­tal may have more than one va­cancy.</p>
    <p>WSG, how­ever, did not pro­vide de­tails on suc­cess­ful place­ments, as “em­ploy­ers may not up­date the out­come of their job post­ings and we are not able to cap­ture all job matches fa­cil­i­tated” by the por­tal.</p>
    <p>It has been send­ing re­minders to em­ploy­ers “to du­ti­fully up­date their ap­pli­cant sta­tus on the por­tal, so job seek­ers are kept in­formed of their ap­pli­ca­tion out­comes”.</p>
    <p>SE­NIOR PO­SI­TIONS AVAIL­ABLE Even though em­ploy­ers are not re­quired to ad­ver­tise higher-paid roles there, some are see­ing the value of ad­ver­tis­ing the more se­nior po­si­tions to reach out to the lo­cal tal­ent pool... As the Govern­ment con­tin­ues to push em­ploy­ers to de­velop a strong Sin­ga­porean core, we can ex­pect more such roles ’’ to ap­pear on the site.’’</p>
    <p>MS LINDA TEO, coun­try man­ager at Man­power Group Sin­ga­pore, on na­tional jobs por­tal MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg</p>
    <p>JOB POST­INGS RE­FLECT GAPS IN MAR­KET</p>
    <p>Ob­servers said the op­por­tu­ni­ties listed on the jobs por­tal largely re­flect gaps in the cur­rent mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy, pro­fes­sional ser­vices, whole­sale trade, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and the built en­vi­ron­ment are the top five sec­tors with the high­est num­ber of job posts, said WSG.</p>
    <p>Ms Linda Teo, coun­try man­ager at Man­pow­erGroup Sin­ga­pore, said the Covid-19 pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion for many busi­nesses, which are ac­tively hir­ing in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy tal­ents to sup­port such op­er­a­tions. This adds to the al­ready high de­mand for tech pro­fes­sion­als that was ac­cru­ing be­fore the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>She added that em­ploy­ers in the fi­nan­cial scene are plan­ning for the long term by hir­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans now to build up their lo­cal tal­ent pipe­line, af­ter the an­nounce­ment that salary thresh­olds for Em­ploy­ment Passes would be raised, with a higher bar for fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>On the pro­por­tion of per­ma­nent roles, NeXT Ca­reer Con­sult­ing Group man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Paul Heng said: “Fixed-term con­tracts are more preva­lent these days, es­pe­cially if the fu­ture is un­cer­tain.”</p>
    <p>“In-de­mand” roles that em­ploy­ers are ac­tively seek­ing to fill in­clude soft­ware de­vel­op­ers, busi­ness an­a­lysts, nurses, pre-school ed­u­ca­tion teach­ers and restau­rant man­agers, ac­cord­ing to the por­tal.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts ex­plained that there is a short­age of lo­cal tal­ent who can fill some of these jobs, partly ow­ing to fac­tors such as widen­ing skills-job mis­match and tight­en­ing re­stric­tions on for­eign man­power.</p>
    <p>Job seek­ers may face more com­pe­ti­tion when ap­ply­ing for jobs such as project man­agers, busi­ness an­a­lysts, mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tives, ac­coun­tants, and hu­man re­source ex­ec­u­tives, which are listed as roles that get high num­bers of ap­pli­ca­tions. Some of these re­ceive more than 200 ap­pli­ca­tions on the por­tal.</p>
    <p>Ms Natalie Craig, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of C&W Ser­vices Sin­ga­pore, the fa­cil­i­ties and engi­neer­ing arm of real es­tate ser­vices firm Cush­man & Wake­field, said its project man­ager po­si­tion, posted on MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg just a week ago, has al­ready been filled. “Project man­age­ment skills are trans­fer­able across in­dus­tries and is prob­a­bly why the role re­mains at­trac­tive,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sin­ga­pore-based peer-to-peer lender Validus Cap­i­tal has started in­ter­views for its busi­ness an­a­lyst role, which will sup­port the com­pany’s re­gional ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>De­spite the pan­demic, its of­fices in In­done­sia and Viet­nam are do­ing well, said co-founder Nikhilesh Goel, adding that it will ex­pand into Thai­land by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>Some firms of­fer­ing these roles said the cur­rent cri­sis has brought them op­por­tu­ni­ties for growth.</p>
    <p>Soft­ware so­lu­tions provider Y3 Tech­nolo­gies, which is hir­ing for sev­eral roles, in­clud­ing busi­ness and data an­a­lysts, said the pan­demic has opened up more busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties, as it “has ac­cel­er­ated the adop­tion of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion” within the sup­ply chain and lo­gis­tics in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Ms Ho Jia Yii of cy­ber se­cu­rity firm Shield said cy­ber se­cu­rity re­mains one of the most re­silient and im­por­tant sec­tors in today’s dig­i­tal world. The com­pany aims to dou­ble its global head­count in the com­ing months. It has been ad­ver­tis­ing for sev­eral po­si­tions here and re­ceived thou­sands of ap­pli­ca­tions across var­i­ous plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers such as Ms Teo said the na­tional jobs por­tal gives a fair over­view of the range of job op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able here.</p>
    <p>“Even though em­ploy­ers are not re­quired to ad­ver­tise higher-paid roles there, some are see­ing the value of ad­ver­tis­ing the more se­nior po­si­tions to reach out to the lo­cal tal­ent pool,” she added. “As the Govern­ment con­tin­ues to push em­ploy­ers to de­velop a strong Sin­ga­porean core, we can ex­pect more such roles to ap­pear on the site.”</p>
