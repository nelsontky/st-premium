    <p>Ev­ery six months, the In­sti­tute of Bank­ing and Fi­nance (IBF) will study hir­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and po­ten­tial job losses in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor.</p>
    <p>With this in­for­ma­tion, it will work with fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to reskill or re­de­ploy em­ploy­ees be­fore they lose their jobs, and de­velop new train­ing and at­tach­ment pro­grammes for mid-ca­reer hires, it said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion will also hold more tar­geted ca­reer fairs that bring job and trainee­ship op­por­tu­ni­ties of­fered by var­i­ous fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions on a com­mon plat­form, and get se­nior fi­nan­cial ser­vices prac­ti­tion­ers on board as ad­junct ca­reer coaches.</p>
    <p>The IBF, which pro­vides skills train­ing, ca­reer ad­vi­sory and job match­ing for the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor, is work­ing with the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore on this ef­fort.</p>
    <p>It is part of the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s new role as the Na­tional Jobs Coun­cil’s jobs de­vel­op­ment part­ner for the fi­nan­cial sec­tor, help­ing to boost op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans to ac­cess jobs and trainee­ships in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>One of the pro­grammes it has helped to de­velop is the Tech­nol­ogy in Fi­nance Im­mer­sion Pro­gramme (TFIP), which was launched last year.</p>
    <p>The scheme equips par­tic­i­pants with skills in new ar­eas such as data an­a­lyt­ics and cloud com­put­ing. Trainees are then at­tached to fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions such as banks or in­vest­ment man­age­ment firms.</p>
    <p>Ms An­to­nia Chen, who has a de­gree in elec­tri­cal en­gi­neer­ing and used to work at ST En­gi­neer­ing Aero­space, joined OCBC just un­der a year ago af­ter tak­ing up a TFIP course in cloud com­put­ing.</p>
    <p>Although she had no back­ground in fi­nance or IT, she de­cided to make the switch be­cause she wanted a job that would re­quire more tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise, and felt that her for­mer role had lit­tle scope for near-term growth.</p>
    <p>Now a full-time em­ployee with OCBC, part of Ms Chen’s role in­volves us­ing her skills to au­to­mate IT in­fra­struc­ture pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>In some ways, the prob­lem-solv­ing process re­calls her old job, said Ms Chen, 33. “The thought process of how to solve a prob­lem is very sim­i­lar, but the tools are dif­fer­ent.”</p>
