    <p>Con­tin­u­ing the de­bate on min­i­mum wage, Work­ers’ Party (WP) chief Pri­tam Singh yes­ter­day called for a uni­ver­sal min­i­mum wage start­ing at $1,300 a month for Sin­ga­porean work­ers.</p>
    <p>In his Face­book post, the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion said such a move is “not just a moral im­per­a­tive, it is an act of na­tional sol­i­dar­ity, one that is even more rel­e­vant in to­day’s eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment”.</p>
    <p>His com­ments fol­low Sun­day’s an­nounce­ment that a work­group com­pris­ing gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, union­ists and em­ploy­ers will be formed to look into lift­ing the wages and well­be­ing of low-in­come work­ers. This will in­clude study­ing how Sin­ga­pore’s tri­par­tite part­ners can fur­ther ex­pand on the pro­gres­sive wage model (PWM) and part­ner com­pa­nies to raise pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh noted the Gov­ern­ment’s min­i­mum wage-plus ap­proach in­cludes other as­pects such as sec­toral pro­duc­tiv­ity and ca­reer pro­gres­sion, which “can­not be ob­jec­tion­able”. But the prob­lem with this ap­proach is that it takes too long to im­ple­ment, he said.</p>
    <p>The PWM, which was launched in 2012, is a frame­work in which wages are pegged to skills, pro­duc­tiv­ity and ca­reer de­vel­op­ment. It now cov­ers around 80,000 work­ers in the clean­ing, se­cu­rity and land­scap­ing sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh asked the work­group to con­sider a par­al­lel ef­fort to im­ple­ment a uni­ver­sal min­i­mum wage with a $1,300 base that is sub­ject to reg­u­lar re­view, even as it ex­plores sec­toral im­prove­ments “or what is ef­fec­tively the plus side of min­i­mum wage-plus”.</p>
    <p>The call for a min­i­mum wage was made by WP MP Ja­mus Lim dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress last month.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, PAP MPs such as Min­is­ter of State for Man­power Gan Siow Huang had warned that a min­i­mum wage would re­sult in low-wage work­ers los­ing their jobs.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam pointed out that the ex­ist­ing PWM and its sec­toral ap­proach en­able the min­i­mum rung to be set at suit­able lev­els for each sec­tor, whereas a sin­gle na­tional min­i­mum wage would force a de­ci­sion on where to place it – which could be too low or too high. But he also said he would not “ex­ag­ger­ate the dif­fer­ences” be­tween the PWM and the min­i­mum wage model, call­ing the PWM a “min­i­mum wage-plus”.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the de­bate, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo noted that in the last five years, work­ers in PWM sec­tors have seen cu­mu­la­tive wage growth of around 30 per cent, com­pared with 21 per cent for work­ers at the me­dian.</p>
    <p>For­mer Nom­i­nated MP and Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira told The Straits Times that there is a lack of re­search on the topic in Sin­ga­pore, as well as de­tailed data on oc­cu­pa­tional wage dis­tri­bu­tions.</p>
    <p>The uni­ver­sal min­i­mum wage, he said, would ef­fec­tively be a PWM cov­er­ing sec­tors where the pre­vail­ing wages are at, or near, $1,300. “The ques­tions are: What are those sec­tors? How many work­ers are im­pacted? And for those who are sig­nif­i­cantly be­low the $1,300 floor, what will hap­pen to them?</p>
    <p>“For those fur­ther from (the floor), there is the pos­si­bil­ity of displaceme­nt, which does not mean per­ma­nent un­em­ploy­ment. It could mean shift­ing to an­other job.”</p>
