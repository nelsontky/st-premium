    <p>For some time now, Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim has been writ­ten off as fin­ished, and his dream of be­com­ing prime min­is­ter was said to be over.</p>
    <p>Even his Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) part­ners were look­ing else­where for an al­ter­na­tive prime min­is­te­rial can­di­date.</p>
    <p>But it’s best to never say never in pol­i­tics, be­cause Mr An­war has man­aged to get ev­ery­one, as the Elvis song goes, “all shook up” after claim­ing he has the num­bers to form the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>He has po­si­tioned him­self squarely on cen­tre stage, and as a re­sult, the Malaysian King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, has once again found him­self at the cen­tre of a po­ten­tial po­lit­i­cal cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war did not pro­vide any num­bers, nor did he name the par­ties that would en­able him to form the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Yet the ef­fect of his claim was as if he had dropped a rock in the wa­ter, and the rip­ples are still spread­ing out.</p>
    <p>His re­quest for an au­di­ence with the King, who is cur­rently hos­pi­talised, is still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Jour­nal­ists have been bom­barded with calls about when the King will be dis­charged from hos­pi­tal, when Mr An­war will be granted an au­di­ence and, of course, whether the Parti</p>
    <p>Kead­i­lan Rakyat pres­i­dent re­ally has the num­bers.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear when the King will be well enough to grant an au­di­ence, but there is quite a bit of scep­ti­cism out there be­cause Mr An­war had tried some­thing sim­i­lar after the 2008 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>More­over, his an­nounce­ment ap­pears to have caught his PH part­ners by sur­prise.</p>
    <p>There were also swift de­nials from sev­eral Perikatan Na­sional part­ners. “It sounds like psy-war to me. Imag­ine if the Yang di-Per­tuan Agong had granted the au­di­ence, photos of the au­di­ence would be fly­ing all over Sabah, right up to Gu­nung Kin­a­balu, giv­ing the idea he (Mr An­war) will soon be sworn in as the PM,” said Umno supreme coun­cil mem­ber Alwi Che Ah­mad.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi gave Mr An­war a boost when he claimed that “many MPs” from Umno and Barisan Na­sional are for it.</p>
    <p>It is no se­cret that ties be­tween Umno and Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu) are quite tense on the ground, but it is hard to see Umno MPs back­ing Mr An­war for the premier­ship, be­cause Umno is try­ing to claim the post of prime min­is­ter for it­self.</p>
    <p>Some in Umno thought that Datuk Seri Zahid’s state­ment was less about sup­port­ing Mr An­war for the top job than telling Ber­satu not to un­der­es­ti­mate Umno’s clout.</p>
    <p>But Mr An­war’s po­lit­i­cal sec­re­tary Farhash Wafa Sal­vador Rizal Mubarak said: “I have seen the list. It is not about work­ing with par­ties but with in­di­vid­u­als. Trust me, it’s a lot; the ma­jor­ity is there.”</p>
    <p>Mr Farhash said Mr An­war would not do this un­less he is very sure of the num­bers.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple think it is a per­cep­tion ploy, that it is a ruse be­cause of Sabah.</p>
    <p>“It has noth­ing to do with Sabah. We’ve got only seven seats there. This is some­thing much big­ger.</p>
    <p>“The ball is in the King’s court. Datuk Seri An­war will present the list to His Majesty when he is healthy,” said Mr Farhash.</p>
    <p>Re­gard­less of whether one is a be­liever or dis­be­liever, ev­ery­one is ea­ger to see what hap­pens next.</p>
    <p>If Mr An­war pro­duces the num­bers, then good for him. He has waited 22 years and it means his time has come, even though he would ba­si­cally be lead­ing an­other back­door gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>But what if he is un­able to pull it off?</p>
    <p>“The dam­age will be great if the num­bers are not there. His cred­i­bil­ity will be shot,” said Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party politi­cian and news­pa­per colum­nist Jeff Ooi.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, it is a game of wait and see.</p>
    <p>On Sept 25, Mr An­war tweeted a video of him­self at the wheel of a re­fur­bished Volk­swa­gen with the cap­tion: “Long time since I drove. Went around the neigh­bour­hood to con­firm that the car is in top con­di­tion.”</p>
    <p>It seemed like a metaphor that the op­po­si­tion leader is ready for the driver’s seat.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war has shown that he can be a clear and present dan­ger to the gov­ern­ment of the day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he would not have been able to cause such a stir if the rul­ing coali­tion had not been rest­ing on a su­per-slen­der ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>He man­aged to rat­tle the gov­ern­ment with­out pro­duc­ing a sliver of ev­i­dence of his num­bers.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, who an­nounced a RM10 bil­lion (S$3.28 bil­lion) eco­nomic stim­u­lus pack­age on the same day as Mr An­war’s premier­ship claims, ex­pressed con­fi­dence that he is still in charge.</p>
    <p>As sev­eral le­gal minds have pointed out, the pow­ers of in­cum­bency are im­mense, and Tan Sri Muhyid­din has the op­tion of ad­vis­ing the King to dis­solve Par­lia­ment and call for a gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>That seems to be the op­ti­mal way to move for­ward – for both sides to fight it out, and may the best side win.</p>
    <p>Pu­tra­jaya in­sid­ers had ear­lier in­di­cated that the Prime Min­is­ter was al­ready think­ing of call­ing for an elec­tion by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>But events of the past week may have helped him de­cide that it has to be soon.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din is be­lieved to have in­structed his coali­tion part­ners to quickly set­tle the is­sue of seat al­lo­ca­tions among them­selves so that he can de­cide on a date to seek a fresh man­date.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war will have to move fast if he does not wish to be over­taken by Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
