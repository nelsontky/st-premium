    <p>All Shaw cin­e­mas are be­ing in­spected fol­low­ing an in­ci­dent on Sun­day, when ven­ti­la­tion ducts in a cin­ema hall in Nex shop­ping cen­tre fell and in­jured two movie­go­ers. Shaw The­atres said it is in the process of in­spect­ing movie halls at six other lo­ca­tions with their re­spec­tive build­ing man­agers.</p>
    <p>All Shaw cin­e­mas are be­ing in­spected as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure fol­low­ing an in­ci­dent on Sun­day af­ter­noon where ven­ti­la­tion ducts in a cin­ema hall at Nex shop­ping mall fell from the ceil­ing dur­ing a screen­ing, in­jur­ing two movie­go­ers.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Shaw The­atres told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the com­pany is in the process of in­spect­ing cin­ema halls at six other lo­ca­tions with their re­spec­tive build­ing man­agers.</p>
    <p>The chain has cin­ema halls in Or­chard Road, Jewel Changi Air­port, Paya Le­bar Quar­ter, Wa­ter­way Point, Sele­tar Mall and JCube, all of which re­main open.</p>
    <p>The Nex branch is cur­rently closed for in­ves­ti­ga­tions, and the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity has i nstructed the build­ing owner to ap­point an en­gi­neer to in­ves­ti­gate Sun­day’s in­ci­dent and as­sess the con­di­tion of the other ducts in the af­fected cin­ema.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that the two in­jured movie­go­ers have since been dis­charged from hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>They were in the cin­ema to watch the movie Tenet and both were be­lieved to have been struck by fall­ing plas­ter de­bris.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral lawyers ST con­tacted said the in­jured movie­go­ers could seek le­gal re­dress as they were owed a duty of care by the cin­ema or the mall.</p>
    <p>Ms Glo­ria James-Civetta, head lawyer at Glo­ria James-Civetta & Co, said the in­jured pa­trons could pur­sue a “tort ac­tion” against the cin­ema for neg­li­gence, adding that they could pos­si­bly get com­pen­sa­tion for pain and suf­fer­ing or even loss of in­come be­cause of the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Raphael Louis of Ray Louis Law Cor­po­ra­tion said the amount of com­pen­sa­tion would de­pend on the sever­ity of the in­jury or suf­fer­ing by the pa­tient.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the amount awarded for slight in­juries such as abra­sions or “knocks” can range from about $500 to $1,000, but this would be higher for more se­vere in­juries like frac­tures, said Mr Louis.</p>
    <p>“In­ter­est­ingly, in the­ory, it is also pos­si­ble for those who are not phys­i­cally in­jured to sub­mit a claim, if they had ex­pe­ri­enced some form of trauma from it... like if they have been psy­cho­log­i­cally af­fected by it.”</p>
    <p>This would have to be backed up in a med­i­cal re­port, he added.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion of which party to be sued will have to be de­ter­mined by a lawyer for the plain­tiffs.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jan Supra­ma­niam, a con­sul­tant with Ed­mond Pereira Law Cor­po­ra­tion pointed out that the le­gal process may be a long-drawn one, as ef­forts have to be made to as­cer­tain who should bear the re­spon­si­bil­ity for the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the cin­ema may be named as a de­fen­dant in the suit, but the build­ing man­age­ment un­der Nex may also be called up as a co-de­fen­dant, he said.</p>
    <p>“The cin­ema does have a duty of care, to en­sure safety. But the build­ing man­age­ment may be also equally re­spon­si­ble for the main­te­nance of the struc­ture, and that could be be­yond the cin­ema owner’s scope,” added Mr Supra­ma­niam.</p>
