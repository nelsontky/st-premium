    <p>• Be­laru­sian leader Alexan­der Lukashenko said yes­ter­day he had agreed with Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin that their coun­tries could unite their troops in the event of a threat from the West, the Belta state news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko, who is fac­ing the big­gest chal­lenge in his 26 years in power af­ter protests and strikes erupted fol­low­ing a con­tested Aug 9 election, added that not a sin­gle Rus­sian soldier has yet crossed the bor­der into Belarus.</p>
    <p>Mr Lukashenko also or­dered half of the coun­try’s army to en­ter com­bat pre­pared­ness in re­sponse to what he said were threats from the West.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he also threat­ened to re­tal­i­ate with re­cip­ro­cal mea­sures if any sanc­tions were i mposed against his coun­try over the dis­puted pres­i­den­tial election.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing a dairy fac­tory visit i n the coun­try’s east, Mr Lukashenko threat­ened to cut off tran­sit routes through the coun­try and boy­cott Lithua­nian ports if sanc­tions were im­posed.</p>
    <p>“I’ve in­structed the gov­ern­ment to sub­mit a pro­posal on re­ori­ent­ing all trade flows from Lithua­nian ports to other ones,” Belta quoted Mr Lukashenko as say­ing. “Let’s see how they live with that.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Lithua­nia will con­tinue work­ing to­wards im­pos­ing sanc­tions on Belarus of­fi­cials, Pres­i­dent Gi­tanas Nauseda’s spokesman told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent sup­ports ef­fec­tive sanc­tions on Belarus, at Euro­pean, re­gional and na­tional lev­els. They are used as an an­swer to vi­o­lence of gov­ern­ment in­sti­tu­tions and hu­man rights vi­o­la­tions in the coun­try”, spokesman An­tanas Bub­nelis said.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union for­eign min­is­ters on Thurs­day sought sanc­tions against Belarus to pres­sure Mr Lukashenko into hold­ing new elec­tions. Mr Lukashenko de­nies elec­toral fraud and has per­sis­tently re­jected the op­po­si­tion’s calls to hold a new vote.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel told re­porters she had tried to speak to Mr Lukashenko by phone but he had de­clined.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing of a re­serve po­lice force which Mr Putin said had been cre­ated at Mr Lukashenko’s re­quest, she said: “I hope that such troops are not de­ployed.”</p>
    <p>EU min­is­ters are cur­rently con­sid­er­ing travel bans and as­set freezes on up to 20 peo­ple re­spon­si­ble for a crack­down on demon­stra­tors two weeks af­ter the election they say was rigged.</p>
    <p>The EU al­ready has an arms em­bargo on Belarus, but in 2015, in a bid to im­prove ties with Mr Lukashenko, the bloc eased economic sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Western pow­ers are keen to bal­ance sym­pa­thy for a nascent Be­laru­sian pro-democ­racy move­ment with con­cern that this could trig­ger a Russia-backed crack­down. Dis­rup­tions to en­ergy sup­plies are also a fear.</p>
    <p>Belarus is a con­duit for Rus­sian oil ex­ports to Europe via the Druzhba pipe­line. En­ergy sup­plies con­tinue to flow smoothly, Pol­ish oil and gas pipe­line op­er­a­tors told Reuters.</p>
    <p>PRO­POSED MOVE</p>
    <p>I’ve in­structed the gov­ern­ment to sub­mit a pro­posal on re­ori­ent­ing all trade flows from Lithua­nian ports to other ones.</p>
    <p>Let’s see how they live with that.</p>
