    <p>RIO DE JANEIRO A vol­un­teer par­tic­i­pat­ing in clin­i­cal tri­als of the Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by Ox­ford Univer­sity has died in Brazil, of­fi­cials an­nounced on Wed­nes­day, though me­dia re­ports said he had re­ceived a placebo, not the test vac­cine.</p>
    <p>It is the first death re­ported in the var­i­ous coro­n­avirus vac­cine tri­als tak­ing place world­wide.</p>
    <p>But or­gan­is­ers of the study said an in­de­pen­dent re­view had con­cluded there were no safety con­cerns and that test­ing of the vac­cine, de­vel­oped with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm As­traZeneca, would con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Me­dia re­ports said the vol­un­teer was a 28-year-old doc­tor work­ing on the front lines of the pan­demic who died of com­pli­ca­tions from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Brazil­ian news­pa­per Globo and in­ter­na­tional news agency Bloomberg said he was i n the con­trol group and had re­ceived a placebo rather than the test vac­cine, cit­ing sources close to the tri­als.</p>
    <p>“Fol­low­ing care­ful assess­ment of this case in Brazil, there have been no con­cerns about safety of the clin­i­cal trial, and the in­de­pen­dent re­view in ad­di­tion to the Brazil­ian reg­u­la­tor have rec­om­mended that the trial should con­tinue,” Ox­ford said.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca said med­i­cal con­fi­den­tial­ity meant it could not give de­tails on any in­di­vid­ual vol­un­teer, but that in­de­pen­dent re­view had “not led to any con­cerns about con­tin­u­a­tion of the on­go­ing study”.</p>
    <p>Brazil’s na­tional health reg­u­la­tor, An­visa, con­firmed it had been no­ti­fied of the case on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The D’Or Teach­ing and Re­search In­sti­tute (Idor), which is help­ing or­gan­ise the tests in Brazil, said the in­de­pen­dent re­view had “raised no doubts about the safety of the study, and rec­om­mended it con­tinue”.</p>
    <p>Ox­ford and As­traZeneca pre­vi­ously had to sus­pend test­ing of the vac­cine last month when a vol­un­teer in Bri­tain de­vel­oped an un­ex­plained ill­ness. Tri­als re­sumed after Bri­tish reg­u­la­tors and an in­de­pen­dent re­view con­cluded the ill­ness was not a side ef­fect of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Half the vol­un­teers in the fi­nal­stage clin­i­cal trial – a dou­ble-blind, ran­domised, con­trolled study – re­ceive a placebo, Idor said.</p>
    <p>Around 8,000 vol­un­teers have been vac­ci­nated so far in Brazil, and more than 20,000 world­wide, it said. Study par­tic­i­pants must be doc­tors, nurses or other health sec­tor work­ers who come into reg­u­lar con­tact with the virus.</p>
    <p>The dead vol­un­teer was a young doc­tor who had been treat­ing Covid-19 pa­tients since March in the emer­gency rooms and in­ten­sive care units at two hos­pi­tals in Rio de Janeiro, Globo said.</p>
    <p>He grad­u­ated from med­i­cal school last year, and was in good health prior to con­tract­ing the dis­ease, fam­ily and friends told the news­pa­per.</p>
