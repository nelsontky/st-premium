    <p>• Sports movie Leap won three tro­phies to be­come the big­gest win­ner at the 33rd edi­tion of the Golden Rooster Awards an­nounced last Satur­day in the city of Xi­a­men in east China’s Fu­jian province.</p>
    <p>Di­rected by Peter Chan and star­ring Gong Li and Huang Bo, the movie about the Chi­nese women’s vol­ley­ball team claimed the gongs for Best Film, Best Cin­e­matog­ra­phy and Best Screen­play.</p>
    <p>Huang Xiaom­ing and Yin Xiao­tian won Best Ac­tor and Best Sup­port­ing</p>
    <p>Ac­tor re­spec­tively for their per­for­mances in The Bravest, a dis­as­ter film cen­tring on fire­fight­ers.</p>
    <p>Huang, 43, was pre­vi­ously named Best Ac­tor in 2013 for his role in Amer­i­can Dreams In China, mak­ing him the first per­son to win the ac­co­lade twice at the Golden Rooster Awards.</p>
    <p>Zhou Dongyu walked away with the Best Ac­tress ti­tle for her role as a vic­tim of school bul­ly­ing in Bet­ter Days, while Yuan Quan won Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress for play­ing a flight at­ten­dant in The Cap­tain, a cin­e­matic por­trayal of the real-life mirac­u­lous emer­gency land­ing of a Sichuan Air­lines plane in 2018.</p>
    <p>Zhou’s win is her 10th for Bet­ter Days. The 28-year-old ac­tress is the youngest and third artist, af­ter Zhou Xun and Zhang Ziyi, to have com­pleted a sweep of Tai­wan’s Golden Horse Awards, the Hong Kong Film Awards and China’s Golden Rooster Awards.</p>
    <p>Zhou Dongyu won the Golden Horse Award for Best Lead­ing Ac­tress with her co-star Ma Sichun for their roles in Soul Mate (2016); and the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Ac­tress for Bet­ter Days.</p>
    <p>The Best Di­rec­tor award went to Wang Rui for his movie Chaogtu With Sarula, about life on the prairie.</p>
    <p>The awards cer­e­mony was hosted by movie chan­nel host Lan Yu as well as ac­tors Deng Chao and Shen Teng.</p>
    <p>Launched in 1981, the Golden Rooster Awards is a na­tional event spon­sored by the China Fed­er­a­tion of Lit­er­ary and Art Cir­cles and the China Film Associatio­n.</p>
