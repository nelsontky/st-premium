    <p>Five former win­ners re­main in the Europa League, as the sec­ond-tier Euro­pean club foot­ball tour­na­ment moves to Ger­many for the last eight on­wards un­der strict health rules and with­out fans. A mar­quee clash be­tween Manch­ester United and five-time cham­pi­ons Sevilla looms in the fi­nal four if both get through the quar­ter-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>COLOGNE • Manch­ester United, In­ter Mi­lan and Sevilla head­line a quin­tet of former cham­pi­ons trav­el­ling to Ger­many for a re­mod­elled eight-team knock­out tour­na­ment that will crown the win­ner of a Europa League cam­paign heav­ily dis­rupted by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>All games will be played be­hind closed doors as one-off ties across four venues – Cologne, Duis­burg, Dus­sel­dorf and Gelsenkirc­hen – fol­low­ing a five-month in­ter­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>While a Cham­pi­ons League berth still awaits the vic­tors of the fi­nal in Cologne on Aug 21, much has changed since the Covid-19 out­break that brought Euro­pean foot­ball to a standstill in March.</p>
    <p>“There are rules and reg­u­la­tions in the ‘bub­ble’ that’s go­ing to travel. We’ve got to stick to­gether, stay to­gether in and around the ho­tel and the train­ing ground,” United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer said of the strict health pro­to­cols clubs must re­spect.</p>
    <p>Play­ers and staff will un­dergo virus test­ing be­fore de­part­ing for Ger­many and again on the eve of a match, a process re­peated for each sub­se­quent game till the fi­nal.</p>
    <p>Uefa has also ad­vised teams to travel on char­tered flights and min­imise con­tact with the public, strongly rec­om­mend­ing the use of exclusive ho­tels – to which play­ers will largely be con­fined – in or­der to avoid po­ten­tial cross-con­tam­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Sub­sti­tutes and coach­ing staff must main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing when seated, with play­ers in­structed to limit con­tact as much as pos­si­ble when warm­ing up, while match balls will be dis­in­fected be­fore kick-off and at half-time.</p>
    <p>United, the 2017 win­ners, face FC Copen­hagen in to­day’s quar­ter-fi­nal in Cologne while Serie A run­ners-up In­ter take on Bun­desliga out­fit Bayer Lev­erkusen in a clash of former Uefa Cup cham­pi­ons in the Dus­sel­dorf Arena.</p>
    <p>Eng­land for­ward Jesse Lin­gard, who played in the 2-0 win over Ajax in the fi­nal three years ago, is con­fi­dent the Red Devils can cap­ture the ti­tle for a sec­ond time.</p>
    <p>“We can’t wait to get there and play this game now. Hun­dred per cent I want to win it again,” he told MUTV ahead of the clash with their Dan­ish op­po­nents. “Lift­ing a tro­phy is a spe­cial feel­ing you can’t re­ally ex­plain and win­ning it be­fore, you take that con­fi­dence for­ward.</p>
    <p>“We have got a mix­ture of youth and ex­pe­ri­ence in the squad and for the young lads to win their first tro­phy, it will be per­fect for them.”</p>
    <p>Should United ad­vance to the last four, they will face ei­ther Sevilla – who have won the Europa League and its pre­cur­sor, the Uefa Cup, a record five times – or fel­low English Premier League ri­vals Wolves on Sunday.</p>
    <p>This year’s Europa League fi­nal was ini­tially due to be played in the Pol­ish city of Gdansk in May be­fore the health cri­sis forced a change of plans.</p>
    <p>Hun­dred per cent I want to win it again. Lift­ing a tro­phy is a spe­cial feel­ing you can’t re­ally ex­plain and win­ning it be­fore, you take that con­fi­dence for­ward. ’’</p>
    <p>JESSE LIN­GARD, Man United’s for­ward, who wants another Europa League ti­tle.</p>
