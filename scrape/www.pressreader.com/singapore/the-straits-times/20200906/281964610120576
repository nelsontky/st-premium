    <p>NEW YORK • Mex­i­can drug lord Joaquin “Chapo” Guzman has ap­pealed against his life sen­tence handed down a year ago by a US court for traf­fick­ing hun­dreds of tonnes of nar­cotics into the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“El Chapo”, as he is com­monly known, is kept in iso­la­tion, in­car­cer­ated in one of the United States’ high­est se­cu­rity pris­ons, lo­cated in Colorado’s moun­tain­ous desert.</p>
    <p>“Chapo Guzman’s pros­e­cu­tion was marred by ram­pant ex­cess and over­reach, both gov­ern­men­tal and ju­di­cial,” his lawyer Marc Fer­nich wrote in the ap­peal, pre­sented on Fri­day to the Sec­ond Cir­cuit Court of Ap­peals in New York.</p>
    <p>The 62-year-old for­mer leader of Mex­ico’s pow­er­ful Si­naloa drug car­tel was con­victed last year of crimes span­ning a quar­ter of a cen­tury, in­clud­ing traf­fick­ing hun­dreds of tonnes of co­caine, heroin, metham­phetamines and mar­i­juana.</p>
    <p>A lawyer for Guzman, Ms Mariel Colon Miro, said the ini­tial rul­ing should be an­nulled be­cause one of the jurors told Vice News he and oth­ers found in­for­ma­tion about the case via the me­dia and so­cial net­works dur­ing the trial, which is pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>She added that the com­plete iso­la­tion im­posed on Guzman since his extraditio­n to the US in Jan­uary 2017 pre­vented him from col­lab­o­rat­ing on his de­fence both be­fore and af­ter the trial.</p>
    <p>“We are very op­ti­mistic that some­thing pos­i­tive will come of this,” Ms Miro said, adding she hoped a new trial would be held.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Guzman’s reign, his car­tel’s em­pire ex­panded across the globe, its ten­ta­cles stretch­ing from the Amer­i­cas to Europe and Asia.</p>
    <p>He man­aged to break out of prison twice. The sec­ond time, in 2015, was via a 1.5km tun­nel that opened in his cell’s shower. He zoomed out by hop­ping on a mod­i­fied mo­tor­cy­cle mounted on rails.</p>
    <p>Mex­i­can marines cap­tured Guzman six months later in Jan­uary 2016 and he was ex­tra­dited to the US a year later, end­ing his decades­long cat-and-mouse game with the author­i­ties.</p>
