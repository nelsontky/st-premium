    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Golf fans not al­lowed on the course for last week’s PGA Cham­pi­onship due to the Covid-19 pan­demic still found a way to root for Tiger Woods and other top play­ers, cheer­ing through fences and from rooftops to pro­vide a brief jolt of en­ergy at the hushed tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>TPC Harding Park sits on the shore above San Fran­cisco’s Lake Merced so there are few places for spec­ta­tors to catch a glimpse of the ac­tion from out­side the gates.</p>
    <p>One ex­cep­tion is the tee box on the par-four 12th hole, which is ad­ja­cent to a side­walk where a few dozen die-hard fans peered through holes cut in the canvas cov­er­ing a chain-link fence.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing the op­por­tu­nity to see Tiger Woods, who is in a league with only Ser­ena Wil­liams and Michael Jor­dan for Amer­i­can ath­letes who are the great­est in the his­tory of their sport – I couldn’t pass that up,” said San Fran­cisco res­i­dent Carl Car­pen­ter, 33.</p>
    <p>De­spite strug­gling to a two-over 72 in Satur­day’s third round which left him on two-over 212 and ex­tin­guished any hope of a vic­tory, 15-time Ma­jor cham­pion Woods waved to the fans when they let out a roar fol­low­ing his tee shot on No. 12, and other play­ers also ap­pre­ci­ated the en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>“You can tell that they are re­ally re­cep­tive to our be­ing here. Ev­ery­one seems to be smil­ing as they come past,” Car­pen­ter said.</p>
    <p>More dar­ing fans used a ladder to climb onto a nearby rooftop that gave them a view of the green on the 12th hole and the tee box on the 13th un­til po­lice came and con­fis­cated the ladder, fans said.</p>
    <p>“I started play­ing golf when I was five, watch­ing Tiger every Satur­day and Sunday morn­ing,” said Adam Yount, 26, who had tick­ets to the tour­na­ment be­fore they were re­funded. “I can’t wait for fans to be al­lowed back. It’s not the same watch­ing it on TV.</p>
    <p>“Not hear­ing those roars for Tiger – I feel bad for him. He doesn’t have that mo­men­tum back­ing him.”</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old Woods, who usu­ally plays in front of packed gal­leries cheer­ing him on, did not use the lack of crowds as an ex­cuse.</p>
    <p>“Satur­day of a Ma­jor is usu­ally pretty rowdy,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This is our new norm. We have to get used to it.”</p>
    <p>And it is not just the sound ef­fect that is lack­ing. The ab­sence of fans has al­tered the com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>Some play­ers, like Paul Casey, com­plained that the course’s low en­ergy was af­fect­ing their per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers noted that Harding Park’s fierce rough has not been help­fully tram­pled by the feet of fans. An un­lucky few have lost balls that nor­mally would not have gone miss­ing.</p>
    <p>“I flat-out don’t like it – plain and sim­ple,” said Casey (68), who was among a trio tied for fourth on 203, two shots be­hind leader Dustin John­son (65).</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing I can do, ob­vi­ously, but I miss it. I play golf at home with no­body around, and I much pre­fer it out here.</p>
    <p>“This is why I love what I get to do, and it’s changed the dy­namic of it. ”</p>
