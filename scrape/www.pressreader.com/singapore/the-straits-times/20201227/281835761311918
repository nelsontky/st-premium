    <p>LON­DON • China will over­take the United States to be­come the world’s big­gest econ­omy in 2028, five years ear­lier than pre­vi­ously es­ti­mated due to the con­trast­ing re­cov­er­ies of the two coun­tries from the Covid-19 pan­demic, a Bri­tish think-tank said.</p>
    <p>“For some time, an over­ar­ch­ing theme of global economics has been the eco­nomic and soft power strug­gle be­tween the US and China,” the Cen­tre for Economics and Busi­ness Re­search (CEBR) said in its annual report – the World Eco­nomic League Table (Welt) – pub­lished yesterday.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 pan­demic and (the) cor­re­spond­ing eco­nomic fall­out have cer­tainly tipped this ri­valry in China’s favour.”</p>
    <p>The CEBR said China’s “skil­ful man­age­ment of the pan­demic”, with its strict early lock­down, and hits to long-term growth in the West meant China’s rel­a­tive eco­nomic per­for­mance had im­proved.</p>
    <p>China looked set for av­er­age eco­nomic growth of 5.7 per cent a year from next year to 2025, be­fore slow­ing to 4.5 per cent a year from 2026 to 2030. While the US was likely to have a strong post-pan­demic re­bound next year, its growth would slow to 1.9 per cent a year be­tween 2022 and 2024, and then to 1.6 per cent af­ter that.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan would re­main the world’s third-big­gest econ­omy, in dol­lar terms, un­til the early 2030s when it would be over­taken by In­dia, push­ing Ger­many down from fourth to fifth, the CEBR said.</p>
    <p>The United King­dom, now the fifth-big­gest econ­omy by the CEBR’s mea­sure, would slip to sixth place from 2024.</p>
    <p>De­spite a hit next year from its exit from the Euro­pean Union’s sin­gle mar­ket, Bri­tish gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) in dol­lars was fore­cast to be 23 per cent higher than France’s by 2035, helped by Britain’s lead in the in­creas­ingly important dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Europe ac­counted for 19 per cent of out­put in the top 10 global economies this year, but that will fall to 12 per cent by 2035, or lower if there is an ac­ri­mo­nious split be­tween the EU and Britain, the CEBR said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, la­belled the world’s most com­pet­i­tive econ­omy by the IMD World Com­pet­i­tive­ness Rank­ing this year, is the 39th big­gest econ­omy in the Welt report.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic had a ma­jor ad­verse im­pact on the econ­omy of Sin­ga­pore, with a GDP con­trac­tion of 6 per cent fore­cast for 2020,” said CEBR. “Over the next five years, the annual rate of GDP growth is set to rise to an av­er­age of 3 per cent. How­ever, be­tween 2026 and 2035, CEBR fore­casts that the av­er­age rate of GDP growth will dip slightly to 2.5 per cent per year.”</p>
    <p>The think-thank said the pan­demic’s im­pact on the global econ­omy was likely to show up in higher in­fla­tion, not slower growth. “We see an eco­nomic cy­cle with ris­ing in­ter­est rates in the mid-2020s,” it said, pos­ing a chal­lenge for gov­ern­ments which have bor­rowed mas­sively to fund their re­sponse to the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“But the un­der­ly­ing trends that have been ac­cel­er­ated by this point to a greener and more tech­based world as we move into the 2030s,” it added.</p>
