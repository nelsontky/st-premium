    <p>When Lucy Shaw suf­fered a stroke in Oc­to­ber 2011, it was a blow to her as she was used to lead­ing an ac­tive life­style.</p>
    <p>The 64-year-old re­tiree used to play golf and tennis while en­gag­ing in other ac­tiv­i­ties like yoga and bowl­ing as well.</p>
    <p>She told The Straits Times: “I was very sad and would avoid the golf course and so­cial dance nights at my club (Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming Club).</p>
    <p>“I do miss the su­per ac­tive life­style I had but I try not to think too much about it as I have to move on. I’m in an­other phase of my life now.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter go­ing through re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion, Shaw was able to re­sume some of these ac­tiv­i­ties like yoga and line danc­ing.</p>
    <p>She now also goes to the gym twice a week in ad­di­tion to her phys­io­ther­apy ses­sions at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Shaw also takes hour-long walks five times a week and cy­cles for 60-90 min­utes oc­ca­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>“When I’m ac­tive and busy, I for­get my dis­abil­ity and fo­cus on my abil­i­ties. Get­ting out and be­ing ac­tive makes a huge dif­fer­ence to me. If not, I’ll feel slug­gish and like I’m wast­ing a beau­ti­ful day,” said Shaw, founder and for­mer di­rec­tor of Shaws Preschool Group.</p>
    <p>“I ac­tu­ally used to shy away from the gym but my phys­io­ther­a­pist gave me some con­fi­dence by en­cour­ag­ing me and we’ve been train­ing with equip­ment such as the sta­tion­ary bike and el­lip­ti­cal trainer.”</p>
    <p>This year, she de­cided to take on an­other chal­lenge by par­tic­i­pat­ing in the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Stroke As­so­ci­a­tion’s (SNSA) Step­ping Out for Stroke vir­tual walk. She will also join over 14,000 par­tic­i­pants in the sold­out The Straits Times Vir­tual Run (STVR) next month.</p>
    <p>“These walks are great ac­tiv­i­ties with a chal­lenge that you can do at your own pace. It’s a good chal­lenge to be con­sis­tent be­cause you can’t skip a day and say you’ll do it to­mor­row in­stead,” said Shaw, who is aim­ing to com­plete 24km in a month for Step­ping Out for Stroke 2020 and 17.5km in 10 days for the STVR.</p>
    <p>“As long as I can move, I will do it. And if I can do it, so can fel­low stroke sur­vivors. I’d like them to know that there is life af­ter a stroke. You won’t know if you don’t try, so don’t be shy, it’s all about re­learn­ing and you have all the time in the world.”</p>
