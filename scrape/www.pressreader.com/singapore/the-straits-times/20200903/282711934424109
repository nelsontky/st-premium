    <p>• Bri­tish singer-song­writer Ed Sheeran said on Tues­day his wife had given birth to the cou­ple’s first child, a girl who they had named “Lyra Antarc­tica Se­aborn Sheeran”.</p>
    <p>“Last week, with the help of an amaz­ing de­liv­ery team, Cherry gave birth to our beau­ti­ful and healthy daugh­ter,” the record-break­ing mu­si­cian said on In­sta­gram along­side a photo of a pair of tiny socks.</p>
    <p>“Both mum and baby are do­ing amaz­ing and we are on cloud nine over here.”</p>
    <p>The 29-year-old singer is the most suc­cess­ful Bri­tish artist of the last decade, spend­ing a to­tal of 79 weeks at the top of the charts with eight No.1 sin­gles, in­clud­ing the global smash Shape Of You, and four stu­dio al­bums.</p>
    <p>He mar­ried child­hood school friend Cherry Se­aborn in January last year, ac­cord­ing to the video for his song Put It All On Me.</p>
    <p>Lyra is the name of the pro­tag­o­nist in English nov­el­ist Philip Pull­man’s His Dark Ma­te­ri­als, a tril­ogy of fan­tasy nov­els that Sheeran chose as his book on the BBC ra­dio pro­gramme Desert Is­land Discs in 2017.</p>
    <p>North­ern Lights, the first book in the tril­ogy, was adapted into the 2007 movie The Golden Com­pass, which starred Ni­cole Kid­man and Daniel Craig. Lyra was played by English ac­tress Dakota Blue Richards.</p>
