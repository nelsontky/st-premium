    <p>This is the 11th in The Straits Times se­ries by Se­nior Law Cor­re­spon­dent K.C. Vi­jayan on le­gal is­sues, with each edi­tion tied to an area of law. To­day’s write-up un­der­lines how in neg­li­gence cases, broadly at least, seven out of 10 cases are set­tled be­fore reach­ing trial, and the rea­sons in­volved. Also, we look at some is­sues that made a dif­fer­ence to court cases this year and a land­mark case that would make it to any po­ten­tial list for 2020’s case of the year.</p>
    <p>Three de­fen­dant com­pa­nies have set­tled a law­suit with the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), which had claimed $55 mil­lion in dam­ages over an ex­ten­sive gas-leak fire in a lab­o­ra­tory at the NUS Kent Ridge cam­pus in 2012.</p>
    <p>The terms of the set­tle­ment reached by NUS with Air Liq­uide Sin­ga­pore and the two other de­fen­dants are con­fi­den­tial and the agreed sum payable can­not be dis­closed.</p>
    <p>“All par­ties have man­aged to set­tle the mat­ter am­i­ca­bly out of court through me­di­a­tion. The suit has there­fore been dis­con­tin­ued,” said an NUS spokesman in re­sponse to The Straits Times’ queries.</p>
    <p>NUS had sued the three de­fen­dants over the af­ter­noon blaze at its So­lar En­ergy Re­search In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore (Seris) on Aug 10, 2012.</p>
    <p>It took fire­fight­ers nearly five hours to douse the flames at the ground floor of Block E3A.</p>
    <p>The blaze caused NUS to spend more than $46 mil­lion to re­build a lab­o­ra­tory and re­place equip­ment at the in­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>NUS, in its High Court law­suit, had al­leged the de­fen­dants’ neg­li­gence when un­der­tak­ing tasks on the Seris premises.</p>
    <p>The fire was caused by a leak­age of silane – a colour­less, gaseous and flammable com­pound – which ig­nited when a vent valve was dis­placed at the valve man­i­fold box.</p>
    <p>Seris con­ducts in­dus­try-ori­ented re­search and de­vel­op­ment in so­lar en­ergy con­ver­sion and oc­cu­pies four floors of the sev­en­storey build­ing.</p>
    <p>The case is among the lat­est of neg­li­gence law­suits set­tled be­fore they pro­ceed to trial, avert­ing more le­gal costs and sav­ing time.</p>
    <p>Lawyers con­tacted said at least seven out of 10 neg­li­gence cases they han­dle, rang­ing from ac­ci­dent to med­i­cal, are set­tled on mu­tu­ally agreed terms, either through me­di­a­tion or out of court.</p>
    <p>“If it is set­tled at first in­stance when let­ters of de­mand are pre­sented, the deal inked is with­out ad­mis­sion of li­a­bil­ity or with­out prej­u­dice. If it goes on to a law­suit be­ing filed, and suc­cess­ful me­di­a­tion fol­lows, then the set­tle­ment terms can be con­fi­den­tial, de­pend­ing on the na­ture of the case and re­spec­tive par­ties’ re­quire­ments, and the mat­ter ends there,” said vet­eran lawyer Gino Har­dial Singh, founder of Ab­bots Cham­bers.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore Covid-19, the fig­ures were bet­ter in terms of set­tling early, but now I have more cases go­ing for trial and/or dam­age assess­ment.”</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to cost and time ef­fi­cien­cies, par­ties also tend to set­tle through me­di­a­tion to avoid the glare of public­ity, said WhiteFern man­ag­ing di­rec­tor K. An­parasan.</p>
    <p>“This is es­pe­cially so in neg­li­gence and per­sonal in­jury cases where most want to avoid the me­dia and pre­fer to set­tle pri­vately,” he added.</p>
    <p>Law di­rec­tor Priya Pil­lay of Niru & Co said an am­i­ca­ble res­o­lu­tion that is just, rea­son­able and eq­ui­table and reached via a set­tle­ment, is “in it­self not a bad out­come as go­ing through the va­garies of the en­tire lit­i­ga­tion process may not in it­self re­sult in the clo­sure that par­ties of­ten hope to achieve”.</p>
    <p>She ar­gued that of­ten no one re­ally “wins” at the end of lit­i­ga­tion, as ev­ery­one pays a price. “Lit­i­ga­tion, taken to its end, can also be a very painful process for many. For ex­am­ple, in med­i­cal neg­li­gence cases or where the neg­li­gent act has re­sulted in death – there can never be any real ‘clo­sure’. Hence, one looks for the best pos­si­ble out­come in a bad sit­u­a­tion,” she said.</p>
    <p>But set­tling cases and avoid­ing a court trial is not with­out chal­lenges, such as where the case is com­plex or med­i­cal ex­perts from abroad are in­volved, said lawyers.</p>
    <p>Where the neg­li­gence claim in­volves a se­ri­ous per­sonal in­jury, it is “in­her­ently dif­fi­cult to set­tle the case”, said lawyer Jocinda Wong from East Asia Law Corp.</p>
    <p>“First, one would have to cross the hur­dle of es­tab­lish­ing li­a­bil­ity. Things get dif­fi­cult if the other party is crim­i­nally pros­e­cuted as the crim­i­nal de­ci­sion may be rel­e­vant to your case in court.</p>
    <p>“Sec­ond, one would then have to cross the hur­dle of as­sess­ing the dam­ages,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong cited a re­cent case, han­dled by her firm, which took about eight years from the date of the in­jury to her client to the de­ci­sion date on li­a­bil­ity in July this year.</p>
    <p>In this case, a lorry hit her client and two oth­ers at a pedes­trian cross­ing on Nov 6, 2012. One vic­tim died in the ac­ci­dent. The client un­der­went med­i­cal treat­ment for her in­juries, with the ef­fects still be­ing ex­pe­ri­enced to­day.</p>
    <p>The lorry driver was pros­e­cuted and con­victed in Jan­uary 2016, and a sub­se­quent ap­peal against the con­vic­tion and sen­tence was dis­missed in the High Court.</p>
    <p>The civil court process was ex­tended pend­ing the out­come of the ap­peal as well as other in­ter­locu­tory pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong added that the trial on li­a­bil­ity started in July last year and ended in Jan­uary this year as there were many wit­nesses in­volved, and the oral de­ci­sion was ren­dered on July 3.</p>
    <p>In the de­ci­sion grounds is­sued last month, the district court al­lowed the claims by the client, preschool teacher Ch­eryl Ed­ward, and found the de­fen­dant, driver Sun Xin Jian, and his em­ployer 92.5 per cent li­able for the ac­ci­dent in­juries, with dam­ages to be as­sessed.</p>
    <p>The court held that Ms Ed­ward was 7.5 per cent to blame in con­tribut­ing to the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps only one or two out of 10 neg­li­gence cases that we han­dle will go to trial,” said Ms Wong.</p>
