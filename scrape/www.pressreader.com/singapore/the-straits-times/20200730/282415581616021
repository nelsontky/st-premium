    <p>NEW YORK • Khabib Nur­magome­dov will take on Justin Gaethje for the Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship’s (UFC) undis­puted light­weight crown on Oct 24, the mixed mar­tial arts pro­mo­tion’s chief Dana White said.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old Nur­magome­dov (28-0) uni­fied the light­weight ti­tle with a third-round sub­mis­sion win over in­terim cham­pion Dustin Poirier in Abu Dhabi last Septem­ber but has not fought since the coron­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>The Dages­tan na­tive’s fa­ther and coach Ab­dul­manap died ear­lier this month at age 57 ow­ing to com­pli­ca­tions af­ter con­tract­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>“It’s been very rough on him... his fa­ther was a hero to him, he loved his fa­ther, they had a very close re­la­tion­ship and it was very hard on him,” White told CNN.</p>
    <p>“That fight is go­ing to hap­pen. Khabib v Gaethje, Oct 24.”</p>
    <p>The UFC had been stag­ing bouts on its “Fight Is­land” lo­cated in Abu Dhabi dur­ing the virus out­break but White did not dis­close the location of the Nur­magome­dov-Gaethje fight.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old Gaethje (22-2) scored a sur­prise knock­out win over fel­low Amer­i­can Tony Fer­gu­son in May to claim the in­terim light­weight ti­tle at UFC 249. Fer­gu­son, 36, had been slated to fight Nur­magome­dov but the bout was can­celled be­cause of travel re­stric­tions dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
