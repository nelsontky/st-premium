    <p>Lo­cal shares fell yes­ter­day de­spite Wall Street’s overnight rally which was trig­gered by ris­ing ex­pec­ta­tions that United States Fed­eral Re­serve chair­man Jerome Pow­ell will out­line a new set of ex­pan­sion­ary poli­cies in an up­com­ing speech.</p>
    <p>In­vestors here seemed more in­clined to take their lead from other mar­kets in the re­gion, which also mostly trended down.</p>
    <p>The end re­sult was a fall of 0.88 per cent or 22.27 points, leav­ing the Straits Times In­dex (STI) at 2,519.81. Losers out­paced gain­ers 256 to 199, with 2.53 bil­lion shares worth $1.2 bil­lion chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Com­fortDelGro was again the best-per­form­ing counter on the STI, ris­ing 2.7 per cent to $1.50. It was also the most heav­ily traded stock with 28 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Next in line was Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional, which was up 1.8 per cent to $4.43. The agri-food gi­ant has ob­tained a $200 mil­lion cor­po­rate loan pegged to the Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Only two other STI con­stituents ended the day in the black. Thai Bev­er­age edged up 0.8 per cent to 61 cents while Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore rose 0.7 per cent to 70.5 cents.</p>
    <p>The STI’s lag­gards were Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) and the real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (Reits) and busi­ness trusts. SIA found it­self at the bot­tom of the ta­ble, fall­ing 3.5 per cent to $3.63.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing right be­hind were Maple­tree Com­mer­cial Trust, Cap­i­taLand Com­mer­cial Trust, Maple­tree Lo­gis­tics Trust, Cap­i­taLand</p>
    <p>Mall Trust and As­cen­das Reit.</p>
    <p>The STI’s per­for­mance was in line with that of most ex­changes amid fresh United States-China ten­sions, which Ax­iCorp chief global mar­kets strate­gist Stephen Innes said had “clouded over­all sen­ti­ment in Asia”.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong stocks slipped 0.83 per cent, South Korean shares fell 1.05 per cent as the cen­tral bank sharply down­graded its economic out­look, while Tokyo dipped 0.35 per cent.</p>
    <p>Shang­hai bucked the trend, ris­ing 0.61 per cent, as did Aus­tralian shares, which en­dured a tur­bu­lent ses­sion be­fore clos­ing ahead by just 0.16 per cent.</p>
    <p>Es­ca­la­tion of US-China ten­sions is ex­pected af­ter Bei­jing fired four mis­siles into the dis­puted South China Sea. US sanc­tions on sev­eral Chi­nese firms linked to the dis­puted re­gion have added to the sour mood.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in­vestors here and across the world will be keen to de­code Mr Pow­ell’s speech that was due last night, Sin­ga­pore time.</p>
    <p>Oanda se­nior mar­ket an­a­lyst Jef­frey Hal­ley noted: “Fi­nan­cial mar­kets are ex­pect­ing the chair­man to hint at lower rates for longer and, most im­por­tantly, to al­low in­fla­tion tar­gets to over­shoot to get the av­er­age in­fla­tion up.”</p>
