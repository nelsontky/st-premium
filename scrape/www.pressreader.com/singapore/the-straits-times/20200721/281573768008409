    <p>Beijing is not with­out means to soften the blow on Hong Kong from US ac­tions. But how ef­fec­tive those mea­sures are will also depend on how the big­ger US-China bat­tle un­folds, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Ben­jamin Kang Lim (be­low).</p>
    <p>Days af­ter a sweep­ing lead­er­ship reshuf­fle of China’s rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party in Novem­ber 2002, then Premier Zhu Rongji set foot in Hong Kong to re­as­sure the city that the next gen­er­a­tion of Chi­nese lead­ers will not leave it out to dry.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the for­mer Bri­tish colony as “a bright pearl with great hope and prospects”, Mr Zhu told a wel­com­ing ban­quet: “If Hong Kong were ru­ined in our hands, we would be­come sin­ners of the na­tion. This will not hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s re­turn to China had then barely passed the five-year mark. A year af­ter that, the Chi­nese lead­er­ship had to bail it out af­ter bil­lion­aire in­vestor Ge­orge Soros un­leashed a spec­u­la­tive at­tack against the Hong Kong dol­lar and stock mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhu re­tired in March 2003. About four months later, the new Chi­nese lead­er­ship was star­tled when about 500,000 Hong Kong res­i­dents took to the streets to protest against an anti-sedi­tion Bill, which was later with­drawn.</p>
    <p>Since then, un­der both pres­i­dents Hu Jin­tao and now Xi Jin­ping, China has in­tro­duced var­i­ous poli­cies to sup­port the ter­ri­tory. Th­ese in­clude eas­ing curbs on in­di­vid­ual Chi­nese tourists vis­it­ing Hong Kong and ink­ing an agree­ment that of­fers the ter­ri­tory pref­er­en­tial ac­cess to the Chi­nese mar­ket. China launched its first off­shore yuan trad­ing cen­tre in Hong Kong in 2004, the Shang­hai-Hong Kong Stock Con­nect in 2014 and the Shen­zhen-Hong Kong Stock Con­nect in 2016.</p>
    <p>COL­LAT­ERAL DAM­AGE?</p>
    <p>The big ques­tion now is whether Beijing can pre­vent Hong Kong from be­com­ing col­lat­eral dam­age in its in­creas­ingly fraught re­la­tion­ship with Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>In re­tal­i­a­tion for China’s de­ci­sion to im­pose a con­tro­ver­sial na­tional se­cu­rity law on Hong Kong, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is­sued an ex­ec­u­tive or­der last week end­ing the city’s pref­er­en­tial trade and other priv­i­leges. He also signed into law the Hong Kong Au­ton­omy Act, which au­tho­rises sanc­tions against of­fi­cials seen as in­fring­ing on the city’s au­ton­omy – and, cru­cially, any banks that do busi­ness with them.</p>
    <p>A source fa­mil­iar with the Chi­nese lead­er­ship’s think­ing told The Straits Times: “Hawks in the US want Hong Kong to fail. But we will not let this hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>While the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion por­trays the move as pun­ish­ment for Beijing’s breach­ing of promised free­doms for Hong Kongers, Beijing con­sid­ers Wash­ing­ton as one of the black hands be­hind the vi­o­lent protests in the city last year, and the na­tional se­cu­rity law as a nec­es­sary mea­sure to re­store safety and sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“If the tur­moil con­tin­ues un­abated, it would be the end of Hong Kong as a fi­nan­cial cen­tre,” the source said, re­quest­ing anonymity. “The na­tional se­cu­rity law is to save Hong Kong.”</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, the de­scent into an­ar­chy in the past year has cost Hong Kong dearly. Two peo­ple have died and more than 2,600 in­jured as of last De­cem­ber. Prop­erty dam­age was es­ti­mated at more than HK$3 bil­lion (S$538 mil­lion). The city has also wit­nessed a surge of anti-China sen­ti­ments, with Chi­nese-owned or China-friendly busi­nesses boy­cotted or vandalised and ran­dom Man­darin-speak­ers sub­jected to abuse.</p>
    <p>CHINA’S PLAN</p>
    <p>Beijing’s tough re­sponse to the un­rest – among other things, the crimes of se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces are pun­ish­able by a max­i­mum of life in prison – have had Western politi­cians and pun­dits pre­dict­ing doom for Hong Kong. They warn that the city will lose its al­lure as a vi­brant global fi­nan­cial cen­tre with Beijing’s tight­en­ing grip over the city.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said the se­cu­rity law was a “death knell” for the ter­ri­tory while Mr Chris Pat­ten, the last Bri­tish gov­er­nor of Hong Kong, ac­cused Beijing of set­ting out to “de­stroy” the city with its new pow­ers.</p>
    <p>But com­mu­nist party in­sid­ers and some Chi­nese and for­eign pun­dits say pre­dic­tions of Hong Kong’s demise are pre­ma­ture. The cur­rent Chi­nese lead­er­ship, they ar­gue, will pull out all the stops to pre­vent Hong Kong’s slide to­wards ir­rel­e­vance. The ar­ray of mea­sures in­clude in­te­grat­ing the city with the Greater Bay Area, list­ing more Chi­nese com­pa­nies there, hav­ing Chi­nese state-owned en­ter­prises ex­pand their foothold in the fi­nan­cial hub and boost­ing tourism.</p>
    <p>“The na­tional se­cu­rity law will not by it­self spell the demise of Hong Kong,” Mr Jim Stent, au­thor of China’s Bank­ing</p>
    <p>Trans­for­ma­tion, said in an in­ter­view. “China will con­tinue to eco­nom­i­cally draw Hong Kong into the Greater Bay Area.”</p>
    <p>Home to about 68 mil­lion peo­ple, the Greater Bay Area is an eco­nomic pow­er­house with a com­bined gross do­mes­tic prod­uct of about US$1.5 tril­lion (S$2.1 tril­lion). Hong Kong’s fi­nan­cial and ser­vice in­dus­tries would be able to ac­cess the mega eco­nomic zone around the Pearl River Delta, which in­cludes nine cities in China’s south­ern prov­ince of Guang­dong and nearby Hong Kong and Ma­cau.</p>
    <p>Phys­i­cally, the in­te­gra­tion is be­ing aided by the con­struc­tion of a 142-km high speed rail con­nect­ing Hong Kong and main­land China. About US$20 bil­lion was spent to con­struct the 55-km Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Ma­cau bridge-tun­nel sys­tem – the world’s long­est sea cross­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Stent, an Amer­i­can who served for 12 years as an in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor on the boards of China’s Min­sheng and Ever­bright banks, is op­ti­mistic that Hong Kong will weather the lat­est trou­bles. Iron­i­cally, the par­lous state of US-China re­la­tions may help the city. “Hong Kong will re­main im­por­tant to China as its prin­ci­pal lo­ca­tion for rais­ing for­eign cur­rency through loans or eq­uity place­ments as it will in­creas­ingly be dif­fi­cult for</p>
    <p>Chi­nese com­pa­nies to list in New York,” he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that Hong Kong will re­main an in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial cen­tre. Prob­a­bly some IT com­pa­nies and jour­nal­ists will re­lo­cate else­where, but the ma­jor multi­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions and all the lawyers, ac­coun­tants and bro­ker­age an­a­lysts will stay put. Af­ter all, where would they go?” said Mr Stent, who also served on the boards of banks in Thai­land, Myanmar and Mon­go­lia.</p>
    <p>While a whole­sale de­camp­ment is not ex­pected there will likely be at­tri­tion. In the case of com­mer­cial ar­bi­tra­tion, for in­stance, jit­tery com­pa­nies fear­ful of Hong Kong’s loss of im­par­tial­ity may scout around for al­ter­na­tive sites, such as Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The re­silience of the Hong Kong dol­lar and stock mar­kets dur­ing the protests sug­gest that it is too early to an­nounce a death ver­dict for the city.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong com­pa­nies can also jump on the Belt and Road</p>
    <p>Ini­tia­tive band­wagon – Pres­i­dent Xi’s am­bi­tious brain­child that aims to re­vive an­cient land and sea trade routes link­ing China with the rest of Asia, Europe and Africa through in­fra­struc­ture projects funded by Chi­nese banks.</p>
    <p>Mr Ray­mond Reed Baker, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the Hong Kong-based con­sul­tancy, One World In­ter­na­tional Group, has said that in the worst-case sce­nario, “if the cen­tral gov­ern­ment did not push tourism, lo­gis­tics and IPOs, Hong Kong’s econ­omy would rapidly de­cline”.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can con­sul­tant added: “It’s Beijing’s de­ci­sion to push (more) IPOs through Hong Kong.”</p>
    <p>China’s sec­ond-big­gest on­line re­tailer JD.com and China’s on­line gam­ing gi­ant NetEase went pub­lic in Hong Kong last month.</p>
    <p>The loss of US trade pref­er­ences may sound fright­en­ing, but it is not fa­tal as Hong Kong has largely shifted from man­u­fac­tur­ing to ser­vices. How­ever, the loss of its spe­cial sta­tus ac­corded by the US would dent Hong Kong’s at­trac­tive­ness as a re-ex­port­ing hub for US-bound ex­ports, hurt­ing in the process, the city’s port and lo­gis­tics busi­nesses. Hong Kong’s ex­ports to the United States last year were around US$39 bil­lion or HK$304 bil­lion (just over 7 per cent of the to­tal). Re-ex­ports ac­counted for 98 per cent of to­tal Hong Kong ex­ports, ac­cord­ing to a Forbes re­port.</p>
    <p>GAME IS NOT OVER</p>
    <p>China’s re­solve to de­fend Hong Kong is not in doubt. If only for rea­sons of “face”, it can­not be seen to buckle or aban­don the ter­ri­tory in the face of Western sanc­tions, not espe­cially af­ter all the weight at­tached to the for­mer Bri­tish colony’s re­turn to the moth­er­land.</p>
    <p>“Who will be the big­gest win­ner if Hong Kong fails? Who will be the hap­pi­est? It’s not China,” said a Hong Kong po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tor who writes un­der the pseu­do­nym Lan Jiang. Liken­ing Hong Kong to one of China’s 10 fin­gers, Mr Lan said: “If Hong Kong fails, the pain would be like a sev­ered fin­ger.”</p>
    <p>What is un­clear at this point is how use­ful the Greater Bay Area and other plans are to stanch the bleed­ing for Hong Kong. Im­ple­men­ta­tion is key and th­ese sup­ports could them­selves be bat­tered in the face of con­certed ac­tion by hawks in the US, Bri­tain, Aus­tralia and Canada.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese re­tal­i­a­tion against Western sanc­tions will likely har­den sen­ti­ments and lead to a dan­ger­ous spi­ral of tit-for-tat mea­sures. Un­der such cir­cum­stances, Hong Kong’s fate can­not es­cape the thrusts and par­ries of the big­ger bat­tles be­yond its shores.</p>
    <p>China is the sec­ond-big­gest econ­omy in the world, but it is still opaque and hard to com­pre­hend. Si­nol­o­gists have mis­read it more than once. Two years be­fore the han­dover, the cover of a 1995 edi­tion of For­tune mag­a­zine read: “The death of Hong Kong”. That has not hap­pened. Nei­ther has the oft-pre­dicted col­lapse of China’s bank­ing sys­tem or of the Com­mu­nist Party’s grip on power.</p>
    <p>That said, re­la­tions between China and the US and its al­lies were not as toxic then, and the world econ­omy was not in such vul­ner­a­ble shape.</p>
    <p>In a sur­vey con­ducted by the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce ear­lier this month, about 83 per cent of HK-based US com­pa­nies that re­sponded said they were “very” or “mod­er­ately” con­cerned about the sweep­ing na­tional se­cu­rity law. But only 5 per cent of the 183 re­spon­dents said they were con­sid­er­ing mov­ing cap­i­tal, as­sets or busi­ness out of Hong Kong in the short term.</p>
    <p>“It’s the am­bi­gu­ity that is mak­ing peo­ple wor­ried... about the rule of law, and whether that will ac­tu­ally con­tinue to ex­ist,” Ms Tara Joseph, pres­i­dent of the Amer­i­can</p>
    <p>Cham­ber of Com­merce in Hong Kong, told CNBC.</p>
    <p>Now that Pres­i­dent Trump has signed off on the mea­sures di­rected at Hong Kong, the fears, anx­i­eties and un­cer­tain­ties will surely rise.</p>
    <p>All par­ties and out­side ob­servers will be pay­ing close scru­tiny to how Face­book and other big Amer­i­can tech com­pa­nies re­act to the newly-minted se­cu­rity laws, as well as how HSBC and other banks re­spond, caught as they are between the con­flict­ing de­mands of China and the US, and ex­posed to pun­ish­ment if they fall foul of ei­ther side.</p>
    <p>For the mo­ment, like the glim­mer­ing waters in Vic­to­ria Har­bour at night, all ap­pears calm in Hong Kong from a dis­tance, but look closer and you’ll see that the sur­face is con­tin­u­ally be­ing ag­i­tated, shift­ing and splin­ter­ing with each wave and back­wash.</p>
