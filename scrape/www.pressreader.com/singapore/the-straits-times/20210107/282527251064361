    <p>TESLA</p>
    <p>PG13, 103 min­utes, opens to­day</p>
    <p>Any­one ex­pect­ing this to be a straight­for­ward biopic of the elec­tri­cal pioneer should think again. This por­trait by avant-garde Amer­i­can film-maker Michael Almereyda con­tains made-up el­e­ments – fan­tasy se­quences, anachro­nisms, break­ing the fourth wall – that puts this work squarely in the semi-fic­tion cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>Let’s just say this movie is in­spired by the life of the Ser­bian im­mi­grant and in­ven­tor.</p>
    <p>Nikola Tesla’s star has been ris­ing in the last few decades, per­haps prompted by Sil­i­con Val­ley cul­ture go­ing main­stream.</p>
    <p>The story of the man who helped make city elec­tri­cal grids a re­al­ity holds huge ap­peal to tech in­dus­try work­ers in the way Vin­cent van Gogh’s story does for artists.</p>
    <p>Both rep­re­sent the idea that rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies may be over­looked or op­pressed now, but will be cel­e­brated by com­ing gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>It’s a ro­man­tic no­tion that has been em­braced by in­di­vid­u­als such as bil­lion­aire Elon Musk, who named his elec­tric-car com­pany af­ter the in­ven­tor.</p>
    <p>Tesla has a story that is ar­guably more com­pelling and cin­e­matic than Van Gogh’s in that it has a vil­lain.</p>
    <p>Thomas Edi­son, the man be­hind the phono­graph and light bulb, hired Tesla in 1884. Af­ter their fall­ing out, Tesla would go on to de­velop one sys­tem for dis­tribut­ing elec­tric­ity across a city, while Edi­son would back an­other.</p>
    <p>In movies such as 2017’s The Cur­rent War, the two sides square off. One side is rep­re­sented by Tesla and more pow­er­ful al­lies, and the other by Edi­son, who tries to win the pub­lic over with the­atri­cal acts of elec­tro­cu­tion – of an­i­mals and one con­demned crim­i­nal – to prove that Tesla’s sys­tem is more dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>Writer-direc­tor Almereyda, per­haps know­ing that the feud be­tween Edi­son (Kyle MacLach­lan) and Tesla (Ethan Hawke) has been por­trayed ad nau­seam in films and tele­vi­sion, opts for a meta-sto­ry­telling method, shown in one ab­sur­dist scene in­volv­ing food.</p>
    <p>But it lasts a mo­ment be­fore a switch to other meth­ods, such as mov­ing for­ward in time to have a con­tem­po­rary nar­ra­tor, played by Eve Hew­son, pro­vide ex­po­si­tion and his­tor­i­cal con­text.</p>
    <p>The act­ing is fine, but the jum­ble of sto­ry­telling styles is jar­ring. It re­quires view­ers to pay close at­ten­tion, es­pe­cially when there are in­vented threads – prob­a­bly in­serted to show that even in Tesla’s early 20th-cen­tury con­text, fake news and dis­in­for­ma­tion ex­isted.</p>
    <p>The mix causes the work to feel like dis­con­nected vi­gnettes. It’s fine in small doses, but makes for an ex­haust­ing watch.</p>
    <p>CITY DREAM</p>
    <p>PG, 103 min­utes, now on Ki­nolounge</p>
    <p>Pity the ur­ban en­force­ment of­fi­cer in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan.</p>
    <p>His job is to clear Lumo Street of its hawk­ers so a chic new re­tail com­plex can be built.</p>
    <p>But there is a prob­lem in the form of a 70-year-old stall­holder. Mr Wang Tiancheng has for years run a cloth­ing and fruit stand there, and is a beloved neigh­bour­hood fix­ture. He will not go with­out a fight.</p>
    <p>Doc­u­men­tary maker Chen Wei­jun has cap­tured in this fas­ci­nat­ing film the con­tra­dic­tions that make up mod­ern Chi­nese so­ci­ety: an ag­gres­sively cap­i­tal­ist sys­tem that has en­shrined a time when the poor over­threw the rich; a place where so­cial mo­bil­ity through ed­u­ca­tion is sa­cred, but phys­i­cal mo­bil­ity is re­stricted by hukou, or the house­hold regis­tra­tion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Chen’s cam­era dis­tils these cur­rents down into a feud that beats any­thing on Amer­i­can re­al­ity tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>The feisty Mr Wang, when served with evic­tion papers, re­acts in a way that can only be called the­atri­cal, be­cause he wants to rally the crowd that has gath­ered to wit­ness the fra­cas.</p>
    <p>At the risk of mak­ing fun of the ven­dor’s plight, the con­fronta­tions be­tween Mr Wang and the en­force­ment of­fi­cers will re­mind view­ers of the clas­sic “Help! I’m be­ing re­pressed!” scene from the com­edy Monty Python And The Holy Grail (1975), when knights from King Arthur’s court ac­cost an­noy­ingly po­lit­i­cally aware and highly dra­matic peas­ants.</p>
    <p>Film-maker Chen gets ac­cess to dis­cus­sions at the mu­nic­i­pal of­fice, show­ing the frus­tra­tion of­fi­cers feel in en­forc­ing laws on some­one who feels that rules don’t ap­ply to him be­cause they come from a cor­rupt source.</p>
    <p>Chen also films Mr Wang’s life. In­side his shabby apart­ment, a touching por­trait emerges of a fam­ily who moved to the city to es­cape the poverty of the vil­lage.</p>
    <p>A ray of hope is Mr Wang’s grand­daugh­ter, a star stu­dent who – un­like Mr Wang, his wife and his son – was born with­out a dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>This is a study of old and new, of a so­ci­ety in a hurry to get rid of its old ways and move for­ward while try­ing to deal with the hu­man cost.</p>
    <p>But, in watch­ing Mr Wang ex­press his rage, there is also the guilty plea­sure of see­ing a quixotic in­di­vid­ual tilt­ing at wind­mills.</p>
    <p>City Dream is available to rent on Ki­nolounge (ki­nolounge.shaw.sg) at $9.99 for a 48-hour view­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>THE PROMISED NEVERLAND</p>
    <p>PG, 119 min­utes, opens to­day, not re­viewed</p>
    <p>This is the live-ac­tion adap­ta­tion of the hugely suc­cess­ful fan­tasy-thriller manga and anime se­ries of the same name.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing seems per­fect at the Grace Field or­phan­age un­til Emma (Mi­nami Ham­abe), Ray (Kairi Jyo) and Nor­man (Ri­hito Ita­gaki) dis­cover the hor­ri­ble truth of their sit­u­a­tion and de­cide to break out.</p>
