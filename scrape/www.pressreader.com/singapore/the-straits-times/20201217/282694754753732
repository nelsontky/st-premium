    <p>•</p>
    <p>SHOGRAN (Pak­istan) Mr Mo­ham­mad Naseem’s eyes shine while he shares the le­gend of a re­mote, alpine lake nes­tled among snow-capped Hi­malayan peaks as a rare crowd of on­look­ers hears one of Pak­istan’s last sto­ry­tellers.</p>
    <p>The story of Saif-ul-Malook – the wind­ing saga of a brave prince who falls in love with a fairy – is just one of the 50 tall tales passed down to Mr Naseem by his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>“Usu­ally, peo­ple tell me I’m crazy when I tell these sto­ries,” says Mr Naseem, whose white beard and tra­di­tional cloak give him the time­less ap­pear­ance of a sto­ry­teller of old.</p>
    <p>The 65-year-old shop­keeper says it would take days to re­cite all the sto­ries he learnt by heart that are im­bued with the his­tory and cul­ture of the land. But few are still lis­ten­ing.</p>
    <p>He has not both­ered shar­ing the sto­ries with his six chil­dren, and friends are no longer in­ter­ested in hear­ing them as so­cial me­dia, video games and soap op­eras have all but eclipsed his an­cient art.</p>
    <p>Video plat­form TikTok is now a ma­jor source of en­ter­tain­ment for the coun­try’s youth, wildly pop­u­lar in part be­cause it is ac­ces­si­ble to il­lit­er­ate users in ru­ral ar­eas – just as the le­gends of old once were.</p>
    <p>“When I die, these sto­ries will die with me,” says Mr Naseem with a sigh out­side his shop in north­ern Pak­istan’s Shogran, where win­ter snow has blan­keted the moun­tains.</p>
    <p>The city of Peshawar – in Khy­ber Pakhtunkhw­a province, where Shogran is lo­cated – has long been the coun­try’s strong­hold of oral his­tory, its Qissa Khawani or “sto­ry­tellers’ bazaar” a Silk Road hub where trav­ellers and lo­cals alike con­gre­gated to hear a well-spun yarn.</p>
    <p>The fron­tier cap­i­tal was once “the Times Square of the re­gion” be­cause of the ex­cel­lence of its sto­ry­tellers, says Mr Naeem Safi, a con­sul­tant at an Islamabad-based in­sti­tute ded­i­cated to Pak­istani folk her­itage, where cas­settes of sto­ries told at the bazaar have been archived.</p>
    <p>“Writ­ing was not very pop­u­lar. The trans­fer of knowl­edge was ver­bal. Sto­ry­telling was fun­da­men­tal – peo­ple con­sid­ered them­selves ed­u­cated if they had heard enough sto­ries,” says Mr Safi.</p>
    <p>Be­fore tuk-tuks and buses clogged its nar­row lanes, the mar­ket was lit­tered with Silk Road car­a­vans of wan­der­ing traders who of­ten stayed the night af­ter the city’s 16 gates were sealed at dusk. In the evenings, they would hear the city’s famed sto­ry­tellers, who shared tales about the per­ils of the road, news of wars and lo­cal lore.</p>
    <p>The bazaar’s tea houses and sa­lons have been re­placed by neon signs on gar­ish struc­tures that now dot the traf­fic-choked streets.</p>
    <p>“There may be some sto­ry­tellers left, but the tra­di­tion is gone. It has trans­formed into other forms of sto­ry­telling,” Mr Safi adds.</p>
    <p>Long-time Peshawar res­i­dent Kh­waja Sa­far Ali, 75, re­mem­bers his youth in the city when the ar­rival of car­a­vans was met with ex­cite­ment.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the day, “we used to run be­tween the camels’ legs”, he re­calls. And when even­ing came, “we would all sit to­gether and lis­ten to the sto­ry­tellers”. “They would tell us about Kabul, the USSR (Union of Soviet So­cial­ist Republics), Uzbek­istan. We learnt about these coun­tries through them.”</p>
    <p>Mod­ern transporta­tion even­tu­ally killed off the car­a­vans, which even by the 1960s had be­come an in­creas­ingly rare sight in the area.</p>
    <p>Sto­ry­tellers con­tin­ued to per­form for smaller cir­cles, but were grad­u­ally re­placed by ra­dios and then tele­vi­sion sets.</p>
    <p>This au­tumn, one of Peshawar’s few re­main­ing sto­ry­tellers died aged 86, says Mr Jalil Ahmed, a tour guide who fre­quently took clients to hear the recita­tions. The nar­ra­tor once owned a small ho­tel where car­a­van­ners lodged and lis­tened to sto­ries for a small fee over steam­ing cups of green tea.</p>
    <p>“But now, the only way to see sto­ry­tellers in Peshawar is to go to the ceme­tery,” Mr Ahmed says with a sigh.</p>
