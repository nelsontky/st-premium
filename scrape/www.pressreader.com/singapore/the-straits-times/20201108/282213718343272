    <p>A fam­ily hol­i­day to Lon­don in 2017 and a chance wan­der into a craft dis­till­ing expo ig­nited the idea for Mr Ash­win Sekaran, 26, to set up his own dis­tillery here.</p>
    <p>“I came back and thought, some­one should do this this year, be­cause at that time in Septem­ber 2017, no one had done it,” says the busi­ness in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy di­ploma-holder, who used to work in busi­ness devel­op­ment for a sup­ple­ments com­pany.</p>
    <p>He de­cided that he needed to “go learn how to make gin prop­erly” first. Fi­nanced by his father and fam­ily friends, he en­rolled in cour­ses and ap­pren­tice­ships in Bri­tain and Aus­tralia at the In­sti­tute of Brew­ing & Dis­till­ing in Lon­don, Brewlab in Sun­der­land and the Univer­sity of Ade­laide.</p>
    <p>Three years and count­less dis­till­ing recipe ex­per­i­ments later, Sin­ga­pore Dis­tillery started op­er­at­ing out of a flat­ted fac­tory in Ang Mo Kio in June.</p>
    <p>Close to $1 mil­lion has been pumped into the project. Mr Sekaran is the head dis­tiller. His team in­cludes Mr Syed Nur­rah­man Shah, 25, a com­puter sciences grad­u­ate who used to work part time at cock­tail bar Ah Sam Cold Drink Stall; and Mr Sassi Ku­mar Sathiyamoo­r­thy, 29, a for­mer cargo co­or­di­na­tor at ground han­dler and food so­lu­tions provider Sats.</p>
    <p>They han­dle dis­till­ing, bot­tling, la­belling and even tech sup­port.</p>
    <p>Their neigh­bours are a health food store and tech com­pany, but be­yond the non­de­script doors of the dis­tillery is a 500-litre, cus­tom-built cop­per still that was as­sem­bled by hand.</p>
    <p>It is used to pro­duce six gin vari­ants that come in a unique bot­tle with an off-cen­tre spout.</p>
    <p>These in­clude a clas­sic Lon­don Dry Gin called Singa; Co­conut Pan­dan, which is dis­tilled with fresh co­conut hearts, freshly grated co­conut and pan­dan leaves; Lime Gar­den, which is dis­tilled with cala­mansi, key lime and kaf­fir lime; Sin­ga­pore Sling, which is made with or­anges, cher­ries and pineap­ple; Stolen Roses, which is a play on rose syrup, where the gin is rested with roses; as well as Kyuri gin, which is dis­tilled with fresh Ja­panese cu­cum­bers and sakura flow­ers.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the ju­niper berries that are sourced from Eastern Europe, all in­gre­di­ents are sourced lo­cally from wet mar­kets and whole­salers.</p>
    <p>“Our first six gins are very proudly South-east Asian with recog­nis­able flavours, us­ing Asian botan­i­cals, but Sin­ga­pore Dis­tillery will have in­ter­na­tional ap­peal too,” he says.</p>
    <p>He is now ex­per­i­ment­ing on two other gins – an orange gin made with a blend of six to seven or­anges from all over Asia, as well as a straw­berry gin made with Cameron High­land straw­ber­ries. There are also two vod­kas in the works.</p>
    <p>As a new­comer, Mr Sekaran feels that he fits into the cur­rent mar­ket by of­fer­ing flavour vari­ants that are unique.</p>
    <p>“Other dis­til­leries here have their own ideas for how their gins should taste, and I’ve got mine... but we’ve all got our vi­sions, which is great,” he says.</p>
