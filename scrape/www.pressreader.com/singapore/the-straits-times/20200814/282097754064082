    <p>WASHINGTON • The US stepped up pres­sure on Ger­many and France with ex­tra tar­iffs on some of their goods, a move de­signed to squeeze the Euro­pean Union into set­tling a long-run­ning dis­pute over il­le­gal sub­si­dies to Air­bus.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment in Washington on Wed­nes­day, the US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive’s (USTR) of­fice said it was re­mov­ing from the tar­iff list cer­tain prod­ucts from Greece and the UK, while ad­ding an equiv­a­lent amount of trade from France and Ger­many. The change is ef­fec­tive on Sept 1 and will ap­ply to French and Ger­man jams as well as butch­ers’ and minc­ing knives, which will be sub­ject to a 25 per cent duty.</p>
    <p>“The EU and mem­ber states have not taken the ac­tions nec­es­sary to come into com­pli­ance with World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) de­ci­sions,” US Trade Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Robert Lighthizer said in the state­ment, ad­ding: “The United States, how­ever, is com­mit­ted to ob­tain­ing a long-term res­o­lu­tion to this dis­pute.”</p>
    <p>The amount of prod­ucts sub­ject to coun­ter­mea­sures re­mains at</p>
    <p>US$7.5 bil­lion (S$10.3 bil­lion) and the tar­iff rates stay at 15 per cent for air­craft and 25 per cent for all other prod­ucts, the USTR said.</p>
    <p>Sweet bis­cuits were ex­empted in the lat­est re­view, and Bri­tain’s gin in­dus­try was spared tar­iffs that the US had in­cluded on a list of po­ten­tial tar­gets. But du­ties on an­other big UK spir­its in­dus­try re­mained.</p>
    <p>“I wel­come the de­ci­sion not to im­pose tar­iffs on gin and blended whisky, and to re­move tar­iffs on shortbread. But there are still tar­iffs on goods like sin­gle-malt Scotch. These tar­iffs are in no one’s in­ter­ests. I am in fur­ther talks with USTR to re­move them asap,” UK In­ter­na­tional Trade Sec­re­tary Liz Truss said in a Twit­ter post yesterday.</p>
    <p>Air­bus said it “pro­foundly re­grets” the US de­ci­sion to main­tain the tar­iffs de­spite Europe’s re­cent ac­tions to achieve full com­pli­ance “at a time when avi­a­tion and other sec­tors are go­ing through an un­prece­dented cri­sis”.</p>
    <p>“Air­bus trusts that Europe will re­spond ap­pro­pri­ately to de­fend its in­ter­ests and the in­ter­ests of all the Euro­pean com­pa­nies and sec­tors, in­clud­ing Air­bus, tar­geted by these tar­iffs,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The EU’s ex­ec­u­tive yesterday ac­knowl­edged the Amer­i­can de­ci­sion not to ex­ac­er­bate a 16-year-old dis­pute over air­craft sub­si­dies by im­pos­ing fresh tar­iffs, and said it wanted to ne­go­ti­ate a so­lu­tion to end the row.</p>
    <p>“The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion ac­knowl­edges the de­ci­sion of the US not to ex­ac­er­bate the on­go­ing air­craft dis­pute by in­creas­ing tar­iffs on Euro­pean prod­ucts,” a Euro­pean Com­mis­sion spokesman said, ad­ding that the coro­n­avirus pan­demic had se­verely hit the avi­a­tion sec­tor, mak­ing it even more ur­gent that the dis­pute is re­solved.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment pro­longs the bur­den of im­port taxes on Amer­i­can busi­nesses and con­sumers while in­creas­ing the pain on transat­lantic al­lies just as the global econ­omy tries to claw back from a steep down­turn tied to the Covid-19 pan­demic. US re­tail­ers, restau­rants and im­porters that are strug­gling to stay afloat after nearly six months of re­stric­tions and lock­downs had pleaded with the USTR for tar­iff relief.</p>
    <p>“There is clear ev­i­dence that the US bev­er­age al­co­hol in­dus­try has been neg­a­tively im­pacted as a di­rect re­sult of these tar­iffs, which is now be­ing com­pounded by the im­pact of re­stric­tions re­lated to pre­vent­ing the spread of Covid-19,” a group of US trade as­so­ci­a­tions wrote in a let­ter to the USTR, one of nearly 24,000 pub­lic com­ments sub­mit­ted in the case.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion won a long-awaited judg­ment from the WTO last Oc­to­ber stem­ming from a dis­pute be­tween Air­bus and Boe­ing that had dragged on for more than 15 years. The rul­ing au­tho­rised tar­iffs on a record US$7.5 bil­lion in Euro­pean im­ports.</p>
    <p>The EU, mean­while, is wait­ing for a WTO de­ci­sion to come as early as Septem­ber that may al­low for re­tal­i­a­tion against the US. Brussels has asked for its own multi­bil­lion-dol­lar award in a sep­a­rate case that found that Boe­ing had re­ceived il­le­gal sub­si­dies.</p>
