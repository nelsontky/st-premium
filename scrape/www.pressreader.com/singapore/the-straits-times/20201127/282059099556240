    <p>The fam­ily of a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany ex­ec­u­tive, who died at the age of 44 fol­low­ing a liposuctio­n pro­ce­dure in 2013, was awarded dam­ages of about $5.6 mil­lion by the High Court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sur­geon Ed­ward Foo Chee Boon, who was sued by the fam­ily of Madam Mandy Yeong Soek Mun, was or­dered to pay the dam­ages af­ter the court found that he was neg­li­gent in per­form­ing the pro­ce­dure at his TCS at Cen­tral Clinic.</p>
    <p>In a writ­ten judg­ment, Jus­tice Choo Han Teck said: “Dr Foo, who may well be a com­pe­tent gen­eral sur­geon, was not ad­e­quately trained to per­form the liposuctio­n and fat trans­fer pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, Dr Foo be­lieved him­self ca­pa­ble and thus did not man­age this case as a com­pe­tent sur­geon in this field should have done.”</p>
    <p>The judge also said that Dr Foo’s de­lay in sending for an am­bu­lance af­ter Madam Yeong col­lapsed at his clinic was an act of neg­li­gence.</p>
    <p>Dr Foo ini­tially blamed the doc­tors at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal’s (SGH) ac­ci­dent and emer­gency de­part­ment for fail­ing to re­sus­ci­tate her, but dropped his case against them mid­way through the trial.</p>
    <p>On June 28, 2013, Madam Yeong un­der­went a pro­ce­dure at the TCS at Cen­tral Clinic to re­move fat from her ab­dom­i­nal flanks, fol­lowed by a fat trans­fer to smooth the un­even­ness in her thighs.</p>
    <p>It was her third liposuctio­n pro­ce­dure at the clinic.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a two-hour op­er­a­tion, she de­vel­oped com­pli­ca­tions and was taken to SGH, where she died 21/</p>
    <p>2 hours later from pul­monary fat em­bolism, in which blood flow is blocked by fat par­ti­cles.</p>
    <p>In 2016, her fam­ily, rep­re­sented by Se­nior Coun­sel Kuah Boon Theng, sued Dr Foo.</p>
    <p>They al­leged Dr Foo was neg­li­gent in his fail­ure to tell her about the risks in per­form­ing the pro­ce­dure, and in his post-op­er­a­tive care. He de­nied the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Choo said Dr Foo had not ad­e­quately drawn Madam Yeong’s at­ten­tion to the risk of fat em­bolism. But the judge in­ferred from the ev­i­dence that she would prob­a­bly have gone ahead nonethe­less.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing to the pro­ce­dure it­self, Jus­tice Choo said: “All things con­sid­ered, it was more likely than not that Dr Foo had in­ad­ver­tently punc­tured a blood ves­sel as he was in­ject­ing the fat into Mandy Yeong’s thigh.”</p>
    <p>As for the events af­ter the pro­ce­dure, the judge noted that af­ter Madam Yeong’s oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion level fell, “the pic­ture that emerges is that of to­tal may­hem and con­fu­sion”.</p>
    <p>Dr Foo said he spent about 45 min­utes try­ing to di­ag­nose the cause of the drop be­fore the am­bu­lance was called.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Choo said there was no rea­son why Dr Foo could not have called for an am­bu­lance while si­mul­ta­ne­ously di­ag­nos­ing the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>In the suit, Madam Yeong’s fam­ily said they lost a sub­stan­tial source of fi­nan­cial sup­port. Her in­come of $420,000 a year as head of re­gional mar­ket de­vel­op­ment at Roche Di­ag­nos­tics Asia Pa­cific was three times her hus­band’s.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Choo’s award in­cluded $1.7 mil­lion for the de­pen­dency claims of her hus­band, 55, her two sons, who were 17 and 13 when she died, and her el­derly par­ents.</p>
    <p>He also awarded $3.8 mil­lion for loss of in­her­i­tance, based on Madam Yeong’s pro­jected i ncome and stock op­tions, which is the wealth she would have ac­cu­mu­lated had she not died.</p>
