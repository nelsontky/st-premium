    <p>LUMPUR • Malaysia’s Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin said yes­ter­day he would call for a gen­eral elec­tion once the coro­n­avirus pan­demic is over. He noted the “dif­fi­cult and chal­leng­ing sit­u­a­tion” faced by his Perikatan Na­sional (PN) govern­ment which has a slim ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment, as it is of­ten buf­feted by is­sues raised by the op­po­si­tion and PN’s ally Umno.</p>
    <p>Among is­sues of­ten played up by them are the need to call for na­tional polls, as PN holds a slim ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment, a reg­u­lar cause of ten­sions in the eight-month-old govern­ment.</p>
    <p>“When t he Covid-19 pan­demic is over, we will hold the gen­eral elec­tion. We will re­turn the man­date to the rakyat (peo­ple) and let them make the de­ci­sion on which govern­ment they want,” he told a vir­tual an­nual gen­eral meet­ing of his Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu). Tan Sri Muhyid­din said PN will en­ter the next gen­eral elec­tion us­ing its own logo.</p>
    <p>PN has 14 par­ties un­der its wing, but only four of­fi­cial mem­bers in­clud­ing Ber­satu and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS). The other 1 0 par­ties, in­clud­ing Umno and Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak, are not of­fi­cial PN mem­bers. PN has 112 MPs in Par­lia­ment, the min­i­mum needed to con­trol the 222-strong House.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din said that though there might be some bad blood be­tween Ber­satu and Umno, fate had brought the two Malay par­ties to­gether. He said he had met Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi and they had agreed to im­prove ties be­tween the two big­gest par­ties in PN. Umno has 38 MPs and Ber­satu 31. “I know the peo­ple are fed up with the un­end­ing pol­i­tick­ing. The peo­ple want po­lit­i­cal lead­ers to help them, not con­stantly fight for power,” he said.</p>
