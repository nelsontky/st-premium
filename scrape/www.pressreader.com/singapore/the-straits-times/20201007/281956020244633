    <p>TOKYO • US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo vis­ited Ja­pan yes­ter­day to rally sup­port from Washington’s clos­est al­lies in Asia, call­ing for deeper col­lab­o­ra­tion with Ja­pan, In­dia and Aus­tralia as a bul­wark against China’s grow­ing re­gional in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>The East Asia visit, Mr Pom­peo’s first in more than a year, co­in­cides with wors­en­ing ten­sions with China. Yet the call for a united front against Bei­jing is a sen­si­tive sub­ject for Washington’s al­lies, which are re­liant on China for trade.</p>
    <p>In com­ments be­fore the start of a meet­ing of the Quad group­ing of the four na­tions’ for­eign min­is­ters, Mr Pom­peo spoke in typ­i­cally un­spar­ing terms against Bei­jing’s rul­ing Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>That was in con­trast to his three coun­ter­parts, all of whom avoided call­ing out China di­rectly.</p>
    <p>“As part­ners in this Quad, it is more crit­i­cal now than ever that we col­lab­o­rate to pro­tect our peo­ple and part­ners from the CCP’s ex­ploita­tion, cor­rup­tion and co­er­cion,” Mr Pom­peo said, re­fer­ring to the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party.</p>
    <p>“We see it in the South and East</p>
    <p>China Seas, the Mekong, the Hi­malayas, the Tai­wan Strait.”</p>
    <p>China has de­nounced the Quad as a bid to con­tain its de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s visit was sup­posed to in­clude trips to Mon­go­lia and South Korea but was cut back to one day af­ter Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Covid-19 di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>He also re­it­er­ated the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s crit­i­cism of China’s han­dling of Covid-19 af­ter it first broke out in the city of Wuhan.</p>
    <p>“When we met, now, last year, the land­scape was very dif­fer­ent. We couldn’t have imag­ined a pan­demic that came from Wuhan. That cri­sis was made in­fin­itely worse by the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s cover-up,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The regime’s au­thor­i­tar­ian na­ture led its lead­ers to lock up and si­lence the very brave Chi­nese cit­i­zens who were rais­ing the alarm.”</p>
    <p>The Quad meet­ing is un­likely to yield a spe­cific ac­tion plan, al­though the gath­er­ing it­self may serve as a warn­ing to China and play to its fears that the group­ing might one day grow into a for­malised struc­ture like Nato, ex­perts have said.</p>
    <p>The US and China, the world’s top two economies, are at log­ger­heads over a wide range of is­sues from Bei­jing’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus to its im­po­si­tion of a new se­cu­rity law in Hong Kong and am­bi­tions in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Most Asian al­lies have been pleased with Washington’s tough­ness to­wards their re­gional ri­val China but have not so ea­gerly wel­comed Mr Trump and Mr Pom­peo’s highly charged rhetoric and re­main wary of go­ing too far in an­tag­o­nis­ing China.</p>
    <p>Part of the prob­lem for Washington’s Asian al­lies is their de­pen­dence on China for trade.</p>
    <p>China was the top des­ti­na­tion for Aus­tralian ex­ports last year, the No. 2 des­ti­na­tion for Ja­panese ex­ports and the No. 3 des­ti­na­tion for In­dian ex­ports, ac­cord­ing to In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund di­rec­tion of statis­tics com­piled by Refini­tiv.</p>
    <p>But Aus­tralia and China have also been locked in a diplo­matic tit-for­tat over Can­berra’s sup­port for an in­de­pen­dent probe into the ori­gins of Covid-19 while In­dian and Chi­nese troops are fac­ing off against each other af­ter the dead­li­est clashes in over four decades on their dis­puted Hi­malayan bor­der.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi said af­ter the ses­sion that the na­tions had con­firmed they would advance with prac­ti­cal talks on in­fras­truc­ture, cy­ber se­cu­rity and other ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian For­eign Min­is­ter Marise Payne said the Quad pro­motes an in­clu­sive, open Indo-Pa­cific, a com­mon re­frain among the min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>“What they’re do­ing is send­ing a mes­sage to the Chi­nese side that en­gage­ment is more im­por­tant than as­sertive­ness,” said Mr Ku­ni­hiko Miyake, a for­mer diplo­mat and vis­it­ing pro­fes­sor at Ja­pan’s Rit­sumeikan Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t mean that this is some­thing to con­tain China. No­body can con­tain China.”</p>
    <p>The US has said it greatly val­ues the meet­ing of the Quad group­ing of for­eign min­is­ters as a plat­form to strengthen its sol­i­dar­ity against China with re­gional al­lies.</p>
    <p>“We’re hop­ing to have some sig­nif­i­cant an­nounce­ments, sig­nif­i­cant achieve­ments,” Mr Pom­peo said be­fore leav­ing for Tokyo, de­clin­ing to say what they would be.</p>
    <p>As ex­pected, there was no joint state­ment from the mem­bers.</p>
