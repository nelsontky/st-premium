    <p>Re­turn­ing to the Es­planade for a live per­for­mance feels safer than ven­tur­ing out to a packed neigh­bour­hood mall.</p>
    <p>For the small-scale per­for­mance trial I at­tended on Sun­day, at­ten­dance was capped at 50 in a venue that usu­ally seats 1,630.</p>
    <p>No won­der, then, that there was plenty of breath­ing room for the 50 peo­ple who showed up for the trial, which was by in­vite only.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC) be­gan tri­als last Fri­day with the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra. Other tri­als, some open to the pub­lic, have been sched­uled at var­i­ous venues. This is a cau­tious step to­wards re­open­ing per­for­mance venues, which have been closed since March 26 to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Cin­e­mas re­opened on July 13 and it was an­nounced on Mon­day last week that meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions events with up to 250 par­tic­i­pants will be al­lowed from Oct 1. So the arts com­mu­nity and arts lovers have been anx­iously await­ing the re­sump­tion of live per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>If Sun­day’s event is any in­di­ca­tion, the Es­planade is well equipped to deal with the lo­gis­tics.</p>
    <p>There are the usual SafeEn­try check-in re­quire­ments for the build­ing. Once a pa­tron gets to the con­cert hall en­try­way, there is a bar­rage of signs – printed in large font on A1-sized sheets taped to the pil­lars – that guides one through the pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>An­other SafeEn­try check-in is re­quired for ad­mit­tance to the hall. Tick­et­ing is elec­tronic, so there is min­i­mal con­tact with ush­ers.</p>
    <p>The bag de­posit ser­vice is now self-ser­vice and con­tact-free. Pa­trons have to take a tag and la­bel their own parcels.</p>
    <p>There is no ta­ble for the se­cu­rity bag check, which prompted a mo­men­tary jug­gle as I strug­gled to open my bag with one hand while hang­ing on to my mo­bile phone in the other.</p>
    <p>At the doors to the hall, ush­ers re­mind pa­trons to sani­tise their hands at the au­to­mated dis­penser be­fore en­ter­ing the venue.</p>
    <p>Such pro­ce­dures have be­come com­mon­place in pub­lic spa­ces, so it is not a big ask to re­quire peo­ple to ob­serve these new re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The trial gave a glimpse of what the Es­planade calls “bub­ble wrap” seat­ing: Seats in front and be­hind, as well as to the left and right of pa­trons, will be left empty for so­cial dis­tanc­ing pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Given the size of the venue, it could po­ten­tially fit more than 50 pa­trons in the hall, even with such seat­ing ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>NAC guide­lines also spec­ify that pa­trons can­not min­gle across groups or con­gre­gate in com­mon spa­ces. Vis­i­tors will have to be civic-con­scious and ob­serve so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The Es­planade has in­tro­duced stag­gered exit pro­ce­dures, mean­ing that pa­trons have to re­main seated once the per­for­mance is over so peo­ple can leave in a so­cially dis­tant fash­ion, row by row.</p>
    <p>It was stranger to watch a per­for­mance in a near-empty hall – an ex­pe­ri­ence I have not had since the early years of the Es­planade when au­di­ences had yet to catch up with then-ad­ven­tur­ous pro­gram­ming – than to ob­serve all the new rules, in­clud­ing wear­ing a mask at all times.</p>
    <p>It was also a lux­ury to be able to lis­ten to live mu­sic again – and in the Con­cert Hall, no less, whose pris­tine acous­tics have al­ways been thrilling for au­di­ences and ter­ri­fy­ing for per­form­ers.</p>
    <p>Au­di­ences seem hun­gry to re­turn to live per­for­mances. As of last Fri­day, 154 peo­ple had reg­is­tered their in­ter­est in at­tend­ing the Sin­ga­pore Dance The­atre trial at the Es­planade the­atre on Wed­nes­day next week.</p>
    <p>Hope­fully, when the NAC re­views the re­sults of the tri­als after next month, more venues can be given the go-ahead to host live per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>The arts com­mu­nity needs venues to sur­vive. Au­di­ences need per­for­mances to feel alive again.</p>
