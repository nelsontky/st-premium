    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A It was not putting more money to work in in­vest­ments ear­lier and all the for­gone com­pound in­ter­est. The les­son learnt is not to put in­vest­ments off.</p>
    <p>Pay for proper pro­fes­sional ad­vice on fi­nan­cial plan­ning, then quickly ex­e­cute and don’t wait.</p>
    <p>What I like about En­dowus is how easy it is to make a trans­ac­tion and fund it. I was able to do the pre­lim­i­nar­ies to set up an ac­count in 15 min­utes and then ready to trade in a week.</p>
    <p>I started in­vest­ing when I was 16 with an in­vest­ment gift. But I never re­ally ac­tively in­vested un­til I was about 35. I should have started when I was 25.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A The best in­vest­ment was one we stum­bled upon. When my dad died more than 10 years ago, he had a few penny stocks left in his Cen­tral De­pos­i­tory ac­count that we in­her­ited. The trans­ac­tion cost of trad­ing them meant the pro­ceeds would have been neg­li­gi­ble, so we hung on to them.</p>
    <p>We would re­ceive monthly state­ments and then some time in 2013, we re­alised that the value of one of the stocks in­creased pretty sig­nif­i­cantly – it grew about eight times the orig­i­nal value. I re­searched the com­pany but it was not re­ally do­ing any­thing of note that would jus­tify the share price in­crease.</p>
    <p>It seemed strange to me, so I told my mother to quickly sell the stock and cash in. She had enough to help her put a down pay­ment on a new car.</p>
    <p>A few months later, Blu­mont Group’s stock crashed and it was in­ves­ti­gated as the largest in­ci­dent of mar­ket ma­nip­u­la­tion. A rel­a­tive of mine lost money when he bought it be­fore it crashed.</p>
    <p>It re-em­pha­sises the va­garies of the stock mar­ket – how much luck is in­volved in the process and how risky stocks can be for peo­ple who don’t un­der­stand it.</p>
