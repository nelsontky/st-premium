    <p>SHU QI AND STEPHEN FUNG CEL­E­BRATE HIS BIRTH­DAY: A pan­demic is not stop­ping celebrity cou­ple Shu Qi and Stephen Fung (above) from cel­e­brat­ing spe­cial oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who have largely kept their re­la­tion­ship out of the public eye, shared de­tails of Fung’s birth­day cel­e­bra­tions on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Fung, who turned 46 on Sun­day, had flown to Tai­wan to meet his wife of four years. They vis­ited Yi­lan County in north-eastern Tai­wan and shared a feast lov­ingly pre­pared by</p>
    <p>Shu Qi, re­ported Ori­en­tal Daily News.</p>
    <p>The 44-year-old Tai­wanese ac­tress pre­pared a birth­day meal con­sist­ing of seven dishes and a soup for her hus­band, who was grin­ning widely from the op­po­site end of the din­ner ta­ble.</p>
    <p>There was also a birth­day cake (above, right), which was dec­o­rated with mini items such as a drum set and a clap­per­board. Writ­ten on the cake were phrases in­clud­ing “Happy Birth­day” and “The Most Handsome Di­rec­tor”.</p>
    <p>Shu Qi, who is based in Hong Kong and known for roles in movies such as The As­sas­sin, (2015) also pre­pared a bowl of steam­ing pork knuckle noo­dles for her hus­band.</p>
    <p>The bowl of noo­dles is a Tai­wanese birth­day tra­di­tion, with the noo­dles sym­bol­is­ing added bless­ings and longevity.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple first met on the set of the 1997 film Bis­honen. They dated for four years be­fore they tied the knot in 2016.</p>
