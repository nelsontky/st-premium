    <p>In March, when coun­tries started to im­ple­ment lock­downs due to the surg­ing pan­demic, the pro­cure­ment team at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal’s (TTSH) phar­macy scram­bled to se­cure medicines be­fore ex­ports were dis­rupted.</p>
    <p>Thus be­gan their race against time to avoid medicine short­ages and en­sure suf­fi­cient Covid-19 drugs – not just for TTSH, but for other hos­pi­tals as well.</p>
    <p>“Even as we placed or­ders with the ven­dors, there was no cer­tainty that the drugs would come in, un­til they reached our doorstep,” said Ms Chong Yi Mei, 35, se­nior phar­ma­cist from health­care lo­gis­tics firm Alps who is based in TTSH’s phar­macy pro­cure­ment and sup­ply chain unit.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the peak of the pan­demic, the team had to or­der four to five times more medicines for symp­to­matic treat­ment, such as cough syrup and lozenges, said Ms Chong.</p>
    <p>The us­age of hand rubs in the hos­pi­tal also in­creased by 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>TTSH and the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases also pro­cured drugs used in Covid-19 treat­ment for na­tional use at the start of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>When hos­pi­tals were ramp­ing up in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) ca­pac­i­ties in April, a neu­ro­mus­cu­lar block­ing drug used dur­ing in­tu­ba­tion was run­ning low. The pro­cure­ment team and the au­thor­i­ties con­sulted ICU clin­i­cians to bring in an al­ter­na­tive drug in time.</p>
    <p>The team also had to en­sure the hos­pi­tals did not run out of sur­gi­cal-grade hand rub and hand­wash when the go-to ven­dor stopped ex­ports. Di­ver­si­fy­ing the sources and max­imis­ing the ven­dor net­work were in­te­gral in pre­vent­ing sup­ply dis­rup­tion, said Ms Chong.</p>
    <p>In­ter­nally, hand­wash was pri­ori­tised for front lin­ers, while oth­ers switched to or­di­nary soap.</p>
    <p>Pro­cure­ment phar­ma­cists send medicines to pa­tients, but they rarely see the out­comes.</p>
    <p>Ms Chong’s sis­ter, Ms Chong Yi San, 41, who is a prin­ci­pal phar­ma­cist at TTSH’s out­pa­tient phar­macy, said: “(Yi Mei) spent a lot of ef­fort try­ing to pro­cure Covid-19 medicines. When we read in the pa­pers that an ICU pa­tient re­cov­ered and was dis­charged, it was heart­warm­ing.”</p>
