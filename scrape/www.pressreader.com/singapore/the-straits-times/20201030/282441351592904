    <p>In­vestors world­wide were rat­tled by ris­ing coro­n­avirus case counts and loom­ing threats of lock­downs. The up­com­ing US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, too, con­trib­uted to a panic-in­duced sell-off in most mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Wall Street ended sharply lower at the end of Wed­nes­day’s ses­sion amid re­newed shut­downs across Euro­pean coun­tries. The Dow Jones In­dus­trial Aver­age fell 3.4 per cent, the S&P 500 lost 3.5 per cent, and Nas­daq shed 3.7 per cent. Tech giants such as Ap­ple, Face­book, Ama­zon, Net­flix and Google all fell over the course of the day as in­vestors took flight.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) yes­ter­day booked its fourth con­sec­u­tive day of losses, clos­ing 1.3 per cent or 32.8 points lower at 2,450.68. De­clin­ers out­num­bered ad­vancers 280 to 159, af­ter 1.2 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties worth $1.21 bil­lion changed hands.</p>
    <p>Re­gional mar­kets took their cue from Wall Street, clos­ing lower across the board. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng In­dex fell 0.5 per cent and the Nikkei 225 in Ja­pan closed 0.4 per cent lower. The broader Topix also fell 0.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>Only six out of the STI’s 30 con­stituent stocks ended the day in the black. Jar­dine Strate­gic Hold­ings emerged the big­gest gainer. The stock added US$0.40 or 1.9 per cent to close at US$21.98.</p>
    <p>River­stone Hold­ings was among the top ris­ers, gain­ing 8 per cent or $0.29 to end the day at $3.93. Top Glove gained 1.4 per cent or $0.04 to $2.89, and UG Health­care rose 2.8 per cent or 2.5 cents to $0.92.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the spec­trum, banks were among the big­gest losers. DBS Bank slipped 1.6 per cent or $0.34 to $20.56; UOB fell 1.5 per cent or $0.29 to $19.11, and OCBC Bank closed at $8.46, down 1.1 per cent or $0.09. Most real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (Reits) also fin­ished in the red.</p>
