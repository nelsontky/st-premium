    <p>As the Repub­lic moved into phase three of its re­open­ing yes­ter­day, na­tional agency Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) an­nounced it would ex­tend the avail­abil­ity of se­lected sports fa­cil­i­ties un­der the DualUse Scheme (DUS), on week­ends from Satur­day to March 14.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber, SportSG an­nounced that school sports fa­cil­i­ties un­der the DUS, which in­clude in­door sports halls and fields, would be avail­able for pub­lic use dur­ing the year-end school hol­i­days. Us­age of these fa­cil­i­ties was sus­pended in March be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With the ex­ten­sion, mem­bers of the pub­lic will be able to ac­cess 50 charge­able fields and 119 in­door sports halls lo­cated in 135 pri­mary and sec­ondary schools from Satur­day. Book­ings can be done through the Ac­tiveSG app from to­day.</p>
    <p>The 169 fa­cil­i­ties that will re­open ac­count for less than 60 per cent of the 290 DUS fa­cil­i­ties, which also fea­ture free-to-play fields and saw a pre-Covid take-up rate of about 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>Fields will be open from 3pm to 7pm, and in­door sports halls from 3pm to 9pm, on Satur­days. On Sun­days, all 169 fa­cil­i­ties will be open from 9am to 7pm.</p>
    <p>“Over the school hol­i­day pe­riod, we re­ceived pos­i­tive feed­back from our mem­bers who ex­pressed their ap­pre­ci­a­tion in hav­ing more spa­ces and op­por­tu­ni­ties to keep fit,” said Sng Hock Lin, chief of Ac­tiveSG. “We will con­tinue to as­sess the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion and ex­plore the pos­si­bil­ity of open­ing more spa­ces pro­gres­sively, while en­sur­ing that the safety of our play­ers, as well as school stu­dents and staff are not com­pro­mised.”</p>
    <p>SportSG stressed that users are re­quired to ad­here to safe man­age­ment mea­sure guide­lines.</p>
    <p>For users of DUS bad­minton fa­cil­i­ties, a max­i­mum of eight peo­ple are al­lowed per court, along with an ad­di­tional in­struc­tor or coach.</p>
    <p>For other in­door hall-based sports like net­ball, vol­ley­ball, bas­ket­ball and floor­ball, a max­i­mum of eight peo­ple are al­lowed per group, with an ad­di­tional in­struc­tor or coach.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple groups can share the court but must ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing. And for fields, a max­i­mum of 50 peo­ple are al­lowed per pitch, with three me­tres dis­tanc­ing be</p>
    <p>We will con­tinue to as­sess the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion and ex­plore the pos­si­bil­ity of open­ing more spa­ces pro­gres­sively, while en­sur­ing that the safety of our play­ers, as well as school stu­dents and staff are not com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>SNG HOCK LIN, Ac­tiveSG chief, on pub­lic ac­cess to sports.</p>
    <p>tween groups of eight.</p>
    <p>SportSG warned that it would take strong ac­tion against in­di­vid­u­als who fail to com­ply with the safe man­age­ment mea­sures, in­clud­ing bar­ring them from use of all DUS and Ac­tiveSG fa­cil­i­ties. A Safe Dis­tanc­ing Am­bas­sador and a fa­cil­ity</p>
    <p>war­den will be at each fa­cil­ity to en­sure that users ob­serve guide­lines.</p>
