    <p>News that prof­its at China’s in­dus­trial firms grew for the fourth straight month in Au­gust, cou­pled with Wall Street’s pos­i­tive fin­ish last Fri­day, put a spring in the step of lo­cal in­vestors yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The op­ti­mism bol­stered the Straits Times In­dex (STI) for the sec­ond straight ses­sion, clos­ing 10.73 points, or 0.43 per cent, up at 2,483.01. Losers pipped gain­ers 197 to 195 on trade of 915.23 mil­lion shares worth $867.96 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Stephen Innes, chief global mar­ket strate­gist at Ax­iCorp, said “it will con­tinue to set a more con­struc­tive tone to the start of the week”, but added that the strength in Asian mar­kets could be tested as more banks are rul­ing out fis­cal stim­u­lus in the United States.</p>
    <p>“With the mar­ket run­ning on less mon­e­tary and fis­cal oxy­gen these days, it would not take much to turn the tide.”</p>
    <p>The top per­former on the STI was the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change, thanks to news that more peo­ple are get­ting into the share mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Monthly numbers of Cen­tral De­pos­i­tory ac­count open­ings have been steadily in­creas­ing since Fe­bru­ary com­pared with the same pe­riod last year. The stock added 2.22 per cent to $9.20.</p>
    <p>Top loser Jar­dine Mathe­son fell 1.41 per cent to US$39.93 af­ter it an­nounced a re­pur­chase of 146,300 shares at be­tween US$40.17 and US$40.2822 each.</p>
    <p>The most ac­tive counter on the bourse was Jiu­tian Chem­i­cal, a Chi­nese com­pany that pro­duces dimethyl­for­mamide, which is said to be en­joy­ing strong growth, driven by the in­creas­ing num­ber of in­dus­trial ap­pli­ca­tions and high de­mand from phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms. The shares added 3.92 per cent to 5.3 cents on a volume of 70.4 mil­lion shares traded.</p>
    <p>Re­gional mar­kets mostly rose. The Hang Seng In­dex rose 1.04 per cent, with mar­ket heavy­weight HSBC boosted by news that its big­gest stake­holder had in­creased its in­vest­ment in the bank.</p>
    <p>Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 in­dex gained 1.32 per cent, while Malaysia’s FTSE Bursa Malaysia Kuala Lumpur Com­pos­ite In­dex ended 0.17 per cent up.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s bench­mark Kospi closed up 1.29 per cent, its sharpest daily rise since Sept 14.</p>
    <p>“Eas­ing of do­mes­tic resur­gence in Covid-19... and op­ti­mism on China’s in­dus­trial prof­its data lifted re­cov­ery hopes,” said Daishin Se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lyst Lee Ky­oung-min.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s coro­n­avirus cases are at the low­est in more than a month since a new wave of out­breaks emerged from a church and a large po­lit­i­cal rally last month.</p>
