    <p>WASH­ING­TON • In his first rally for his last-minute United States pres­i­den­tial cam­paign, rap­per Kanye West (left) ranted against abor­tion and pornog­ra­phy, ar­gued pol­icy with at­ten­dees and, at one point, broke down in tears.</p>
    <p>West, 43, a for­mer sup­porter of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump who has left vot­ers be­fud­dled over whether his cam­paign is gen­uine or a pub­lic­ity stunt to help sell al­bums or mer­chan­dise, de­liv­ered ram­bling re­marks dur­ing the event at a Charleston, South Carolina, wed­ding venue and con­ven­tion cen­tre.</p>
    <p>In re­marks that lasted just over an hour, he de­nounced abor­tion, swore, called on ran­dom mem­bers to speak, ap­peared to be putting for­ward pol­icy pro­pos­als on the fly and made com­ments that left even those in at­ten­dance mut­ter­ing in dis­be­lief.</p>
    <p>“Har­riet Tub­man never ac­tu­ally freed the slaves. She just had the slaves work for other white peo­ple,” he said at one point when dis­cussing eco­nomic in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>The event, which was livestream­ed on YouTube and car­ried on lo­cal tele­vi­sion sta­tions, did lit­tle to clar­ify whether West is gen­uinely at­tempt­ing to win the pres­i­dency. The cam­paign he launched with a July 4 tweet has al­ready missed sev­eral dead­lines to ap­pear on key state bal­lots.</p>
    <p>At times, he seemed to sug­gest he was more in­ter­ested in dis­sem­i­nat­ing a mes­sage than win­ning the pres­i­dency. “Free­dom does not come from an elec­tion. The free­dom comes from you not load­ing up the pornog­ra­phy,” he said at one point. He ap­peared on stage with “2020” shaved into the back of his head and wear­ing what ap­peared to be a mil­i­tary-style vest.</p>
    <p>He ar­gued that abor­tion should be le­gal but heav­ily dis­cour­aged, sug­gest­ing he would pro­mote a pol­icy as pres­i­dent that any­one who gives birth to a child be given US$1 mil­lion (S$1.39 mil­lion) “or some­thing in that fam­ily”.</p>
    <p>West re­ferred to the Bi­ble and Chris­tian teach­ings mul­ti­ple times and broke down in tears at one point while de­scrib­ing how he was nearly aborted by his par­ents.</p>
    <p>The event car­ried few sim­i­lar­i­ties with typ­i­cal pol­ished can­di­date events. The venue ap­peared to lack au­di­ence mi­cro­phones, so West re­peat­edly told the crowd to be silent so au­di­ence mem­bers he called on could be heard.</p>
