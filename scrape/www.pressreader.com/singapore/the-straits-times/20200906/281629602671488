    <p>One of south­ern Jo­hor’s busiest towns which thrived on vis­i­tors from next-door Sin­ga­pore has been hard hit by the clo­sure of the two land cross­ings, with malls and eater­ies in Iskan­dar Pu­teri look­ing halfempty.</p>
    <p>The Le­goland Malaysia theme park, a ma­jor at­trac­tion in Iskan­dar Pu­teri, which re­opened its doors on June 26 af­ter be­ing shut­tered for sev­eral months un­der Malaysia’s move­ment curbs, now de­pends heav­ily on Malaysian vis­i­tors, as in­ter­na­tional bor­ders have re­mained closed.</p>
    <p>Le­goland has the added bur­den of hav­ing to cut its daily ca­pac­ity to just 30 per cent of nor­mal op­er­a­tions as part of health­care mea­sures to pre­vent the spread of the coro­n­avirus. The theme park can usu­ally han­dle up to 10,000 vis­i­tors a day, a park worker told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Iskan­dar Pu­teri, formerly known as Nusa­jaya, is lo­cated a short drive away from the Malaysian side of the im­mi­gra­tion check­point at the Tuas Sec­ond Link.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Nazri­ana Mohd Khalid, a su­per­vi­sor at Ben’s In­de­pen­dent Gro­cer at the Mall of Me­dini just out­side Le­goland: “We have seen a 40 per cent drop in cus­tomers” since Malaysia im­posed the move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO).</p>
    <p>Nearby, the Pu­teri Harbour tourist spot looks al­most dead with the dou­ble whammy of the San­rio Hello Kitty Town theme park shut­ting down on Jan 1 and now the lack of for­eign vis­i­tors, a re­cent visit by The Sun­day Times found.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral shops and restau­rants in the com­plex have also shut down.</p>
    <p>In a re­flec­tion of how slow things are, a fully fur­nished two-bed­room apart­ment in the area was listed on an on­line book­ing web­site for RM40 (S$13) a night last month, a frac­tion of the usual daily rate of be­tween RM120 and RM300.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, Iskan­dar Pu­teri flour­ished from not just the in­flux of Sin­ga­pore­ans but also in­ter­na­tional tourists es­pe­cially from China, who eyed con­do­mini­ums in the many pro­jects backed by com­pa­nies from China such as For­est City.</p>
    <p>The Cause­way re­opened last month, but only to al­low travel for es­sen­tial meet­ings and en­able work­ers to meet their fam­i­lies more of­ten.</p>
    <p>More than 300,000 trav­ellers used the Cause­way ev­ery day be­fore the Covid-19 out­break, in­clud­ing some 100,000 Malaysians who com­muted daily be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia. Daily cross­ings are now re­stricted to 2,000 a day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to data from Tourism Malaysia, Sin­ga­porean tourists are the high­est spenders. They shelled out an es­ti­mated RM11.56 bil­lion be­tween Jan­uary and June last year.</p>
    <p>Re­tail staff at the Sun­way Big Box Re­tail Park, which opened in De­cem­ber last year, said they used to see many Sin­ga­porean vis­i­tors at the 7.7 mil­lion sq ft open-air mall lo­cated just five min­utes from the Sec­ond Link. “There are fewer shop­pers now com­pared with be­fore the MCO. There used to be a lot of Sin­ga­porean shop­pers here but now that the bor­ders are closed, they can’t come any more,” said a worker at a hard­ware shop at Big Box.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tor Sun­way Malls and Theme Parks said it has seen a drop of around 40 per cent in vis­i­tors to Big Box. “Be­fore the MCO, 10 per cent of our vis­i­tors were Sin­ga­pore­ans. And since bor­der con­trols have been im­ple­mented, these vis­its have been tem­po­rar­ily scaled</p>
    <p>FEWER CUS­TOMERS</p>
    <p>There are fewer shop­pers now com­pared with be­fore the MCO (move­ment con­trol or­der). There used to be a lot of Sin­ga­porean shop­pers here but now that the bor­ders are closed, they can’t come any more.’’</p>

    <p>back,” Sun­way Malls and Theme Parks chief ex­ec­u­tive H.C. Chan told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Sun­way Big Box Re­tail Park has a cin­ema com­ing up, a four-star ho­tel, out­door glamp­ing by the lake and ex­treme sports.</p>
    <p>“We tar­get to have 35 per cent Sin­ga­porean vis­i­tors in the long term when nor­mal­ity re­turns,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>Neigh­bour­ing towns such as Sku­dai, a 20-minute drive from Iskan­dar Pu­teri, are also see­ing a rip­ple ef­fect from the lack of Sin­ga­porean vis­i­tors, with some shops forced to close down, and busi­nesses such as re­flex­ol­ogy out­lets strug­gling to stay afloat.</p>
    <p>“We need that bridge open. The lo­cal busi­nesses here are very de­pen­dent on Sin­ga­pore­ans com­ing over,” said res­i­dent and busi­ness owner Joanne Lee, 38, re­fer­ring to the Sec­ond Link bridge.</p>
