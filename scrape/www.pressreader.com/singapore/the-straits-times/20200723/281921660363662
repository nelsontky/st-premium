    <p>BEI­JING • Bei­jing has ac­cused the United States of “slan­der”, after two Chi­nese na­tion­als were in­dicted for seek­ing to steal coro­n­avirus vac­cine re­search and hack­ing hun­dreds of com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment is a staunch de­fender of cy­ber se­cu­rity, and has al­ways op­posed and cracked down on cy­ber at­tacks and cy­ber­crime i n all forms,” said Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin yesterday.</p>
    <p>The US must “im­me­di­ately stop its slan­der and smear­ing of China on cy­ber-se­cu­rity is­sues”, Mr Wang told a reg­u­lar news brief­ing.</p>
    <p>The US Jus­tice De­part­ment on Tues­day in­dicted Chi­nese na­tion­als Li Xiaoyu and Dong Ji­azhi over their role in what the agency called a decade-long cy­ber es­pi­onage cam­paign that has tar­geted de­fence con­trac­tors, Covid-19 re­searchers and hun­dreds of other vic­tims world­wide.</p>
    <p>The US au­thor­i­ties said the two Chi­nese men stole ter­abytes of weapons de­signs, drug in­for­ma­tion, soft­ware source code and per­sonal data from tar­gets that in­cluded Hong Kong pro­test­ers, the of­fice of the Dalai Lama and a Chi­nese Chris­tian non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>They were con­trac­tors for the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, rather than full-fledged spies, US of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>US As­sis­tant At­tor­ney-Gen­eral for Na­tional Se­cu­rity John De­mers said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence: “China has now taken its place, along­side Rus­sia, Iran, and North Korea, in that shame­ful club of na­tions that pro­vides safe haven for cy­ber crim­i­nals in ex­change for those crim­i­nals be­ing on call for the ben­e­fit of the state.”</p>
    <p>The in­dict­ment mostly did not name any com­pa­nies or in­di­vid­ual tar­gets, but US at­tor­ney Wil­liam Hys­lop, who spoke along­side Mr De­mers, cited “hun­dreds and hun­dreds of vic­tims in the United States and world­wide”.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said the probe was trig­gered when the hack­ers broke into a net­work be­long­ing to the Han­ford Site, a de­com­mis­sioned US nu­clear com­plex in east­ern Wash­ing­ton state, in 2015.</p>
    <p>Li and Dong were “one of the most pro­lific groups of hack­ers we’ve in­ves­ti­gated”, said Fed­eral Bureau of Investigat­ion spe­cial agent Ray­mond Duda, who heads the agency’s Seat­tle field of­fice.</p>
    <p>A July 7 i ndict­ment made pub­lic on Tues­day al­leges that Li and Dong were con­trac­tors for China’s Min­istry of State Se­cu­rity, a com­pa­ra­ble agency to the US’ Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency.</p>
    <p>As early as Jan 27, as the coro­n­avirus out­break was com­ing into fo­cus, the hack­ers were try­ing to steal Covid-19 vac­cine re­search of an uniden­ti­fied Mas­sachusetts biotech­nol­ogy firm, the in­dict­ment said. It is un­clear whether any­thing was stolen.</p>
