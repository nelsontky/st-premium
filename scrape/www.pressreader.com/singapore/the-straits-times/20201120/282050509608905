    <p>It will prob­a­bly be dif­fi­cult for the Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL) to at­tain view­er­ship num­bers com­pa­ra­ble to other leagues in the re­gion such as the Malaysian and Thai leagues, but to even give the SPL the slight­est chance to be­come pop­u­lar with the local football fans, one as­pect which needs im­prove­ment would be the level of play.</p>
    <p>I con­cur with Lion City Sailors coach Aure­lio Vid­mar’s sen­ti­ments and frus­tra­tions re­gard­ing the SPL (S’pore foot­ballers too comfy, men­tal­ity change needed to progress: Sailors coach, ST On­line, Nov 16).</p>
    <p>Most peo­ple who are truly fa­mil­iar with the SPL, and fol­low it week in, week out, would know that there are def­i­nitely qual­ity local play­ers in the league.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, over a week ago, we had Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional striker Khairul Nizam scor­ing a won­der goal, and just on Tues­day, the local play­ers of Lion City Sailors stepped up to grind out a win af­ter their for­eign star Stipe Plaz­i­bat was forced off due to in­jury.</p>
    <p>Play­ers who can cre­ate something out of noth­ing and have the po­ten­tial to be­come local stars of the game are ar­guably present in ev­ery team. Yet, due to the rel­a­tively slow-paced na­ture of</p>
    <p>SPL matches, these play­ers tend to fit in in­stead of per­form­ing at the level they are ca­pa­ble of, as Vid­mar sug­gested.</p>
    <p>In this re­spect, for­eign play­ers may be ben­e­fi­cial for the teams and the league, as they are able to in­stantly change the pace of the game. This may bring about pos­i­tive in­flu­ences on the local play­ers as well.</p>
    <p>Al­birex Ni­igata con­sists of Ja­panese play­ers who have mostly come out of univer­sity and de­cided to ply their trade in Sin­ga­pore, and while they usu­ally be­come ac­cus­tomed to the level of play in the SPL, they can still up the pace of the game on their own when nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>I think that is an area in which our local teams and play­ers can learn from for­eign ones.</p>
    <p>While I do not ex­pect ev­ery team to start play­ing top-notch football out of the blue, as a fan, I sim­ply hope to see teams be more ad­ven­tur­ous and unique with their styles of play.</p>
    <p>That way, local play­ers may im­prove in­di­vid­u­ally and get the chance to play for over­seas clubs, and the SPL will also at­tract more view­ers and pos­si­bly im­prove its rep­u­ta­tion among local fans.</p>
