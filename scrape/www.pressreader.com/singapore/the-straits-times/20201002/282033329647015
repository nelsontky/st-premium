    <p>If In­dia re­forms only when un­der pres­sure, then now should be a mo­ment for big changes: Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) con­tracted nearly 24 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, more than any other large econ­omy; tens of mil­lions have lost jobs in the for­mal and in­for­mal sec­tors; and the coun­try is adding more than 85,000 con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases each day.</p>
    <p>There’s an ob­vi­ous place for the govern­ment to start too: Fix­ing In­dia’s failed spe­cial eco­nomic zones (SEZs).</p>
    <p>China, of course, pi­o­neered the idea of test­ing po­lit­i­cally dif­fi­cult eco­nomic and le­gal re­forms in a few such ar­eas be­fore rolling them out more widely.</p>
    <p>The ex­per­i­ment proved wildly suc­cess­ful. Shen­zhen, one of its first SEZs, grew from a pop­u­la­tion of 310,000 and a GDP of US$160 mil­lion in 1981 to a pop­u­la­tion of 12.5 mil­lion, a GDP of US$388 bil­lion (S$529 bil­lion) and per capita in­come in ex­cess of US$30,000 by last year – surely the fastest-ever in­crease in hu­man pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>The model is even more ap­peal­ing in a messy democ­racy such as In­dia, where vested in­ter­ests and a risk-averse bu­reau­cracy have stymied pre­vi­ous at­tempts at rad­i­cal eco­nomic re­forms.</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, the coun­try is home to 238 such zones. The re­sults have been un­der­whelm­ing, how­ever, for sev­eral rea­sons.</p>
    <p>For one thing, there are sim­ply too many SEZs. In­dian state ca­pac­ity is al­ready lim­ited. Ask­ing the govern­ment to pro­vide even a ba­sic suite of ser­vices in so many places is fu­tile. (In­dia is run­ning into sim­i­lar prob­lems in try­ing to de­velop a mul­ti­tude of “smart cities”.)</p>
    <p>China’s ex­per­i­ment be­gan with just four such zones in Shen­zhen, Shan­tou, Xi­a­men and Zhuhai. In­dia should do the same.</p>
    <p>More­over, whereas the</p>
    <p>Shen­zhen ag­glom­er­a­tion alone sprawls across 2,000 sq km, all of In­dia’s SEZs put to­gether oc­cupy less than 500 sq km.</p>
    <p>Larger zones ben­e­fit from sev­eral spillover ef­fects: They at­tract clus­ters of busi­nesses, en­cour­age knowl­edge trans­fers from for­eign to do­mes­tic com­pa­nies, and spread em­ploy­ment, in­fra­struc­ture and de­vel­op­ment to neigh­bour­ing re­gions. In­dia’s zones are too small to do the same.</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tant, the sup­posed “re­forms” In­dia has im­ple­mented in its SEZs have been any­thing but. They’ve largely cen­tred on con­ces­sions to favoured busi­nesses – tax sops and cheap real es­tate – rather than a fun­da­men­tal re­set of In­dia’s con­vo­luted and re­stric­tive rules for do­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>If low taxes were all that mat­tered for at­tract­ing in­vest­ment, any poor coun­try could en­tice global man­u­fac­tur­ers by slash­ing taxes. Clearly, good gov­er­nance and strong rule of law mat­ter a great deal more to such busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment, which is re­port­edly mulling over a</p>
    <p>US$23 bil­lion pack­age of in­cen­tives to at­tract global man­u­fac­tur­ers to In­dia, wisely sees an op­por­tu­nity. The pan­demic has ex­posed the fragility of crit­i­cal global sup­ply chains. No coun­try wants to con­cen­trate risks in any one ju­ris­dic­tion, es­pe­cially given ris­ing trade and geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions be­tween China and the West.</p>
    <p>To lure man­u­fac­tur­ers away from the main­land though, In­dia is go­ing to have to con­vince them that they’ll be able to op­er­ate just as eas­ily and ef­fi­ciently as they can in China.</p>
    <p>A few big zones should be lo­cated ei­ther near deep-wa­ter ports or around large air­ports. They can be green­field or brown­field sites, de­pend­ing on whether the fo­cus is on man­u­fac­tur­ing or ser­vices. The lat­ter could ex­ploit un­der­utilised pub­lic lands, such as the east­ern wa­ter­front of Mum­bai.</p>
    <p>Of course, they all need to of­fer re­li­able wa­ter and power, af­ford­able hous­ing and ex­cel­lent trans­port con­nec­tiv­ity. Above all, these zones must pro­vide the kind of gov­er­nance and clar­ity that’s in short sup­ply across the rest of In­dia.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal ad­min­is­tra­tors must be em­pow­ered to make rad­i­cal changes to labour laws, for in­stance. Fast-track courts to re­solve dis­putes are crit­i­cal, as is elim­i­nat­ing most re­stric­tions on for­eign in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>The point is not just to make pro­duc­tion cheaper but also to cre­ate a fun­da­men­tally dif­fer­ent at­mos­phere for do­ing busi­ness than com­pa­nies would find else­where on the sub­con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>Of course, suc­cess will cre­ate its own po­lit­i­cal headaches, as a few re­gions get richer than oth­ers. But com­pared with the al­ter­na­tive – a fu­ture in which In­dia never em­beds it­self fully into global sup­ply chains and can’t cre­ate the mil­lions of salaried jobs its young and grow­ing pop­u­la­tion de­mands – that’s a prob­lem the govern­ment should wel­come.</p>
