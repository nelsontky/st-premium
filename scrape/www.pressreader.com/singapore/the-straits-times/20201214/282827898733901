    <p>NEW YORK • Amer­i­can singer Charley Pride (right), a son of share­crop­pers who rose to be­come coun­try mu­sic’s first black su­per­star on the strength of hits in­clud­ing Kiss An An­gel Good Mornin’ and Is Any­body Goin’ To San An­tone, died last Satur­day in hospice care in Dal­las. He was 86.</p>
    <p>A pub­li­cist for Pride said the cause was com­pli­ca­tions of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Pride was not the first black artist to record coun­try mu­sic, but none of his pre­de­ces­sors had any­where near the de­gree of suc­cess he en­joyed.</p>
    <p>In 1971, he won the Coun­try Mu­sic As­so­ci­a­tion’s en­ter­tainer of the year award.</p>
    <p>Pride was born on March 18, 1934, in Sledge, Mis­sis­sippi. He served in the United States Army be­fore mov­ing to Mon­tana to try to make it as a base­ball player.</p>
    <p>Pride was dis­cov­ered in a bar in Mon­tana, singing Hank Wil­liams’ Lovesick Blues. He be­gan his record­ing ca­reer in 1963. Two years later, he signed a con­tract with RCA Records. In 1967, his record­ing of Just Be­tween You And Me be­came a Top 10 hit on Bill­board’s coun­try mu­sic charts.</p>
    <p>Last month in Nashville, Pride re­ceived the Coun­try Mu­sic As­so­ci­a­tion’s Life­time Achieve­ment Award. It was his last pub­lic per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>He is sur­vived by his wife, Ebby Rozene Cohran, and chil­dren, Carl­ton, Charles and An­gela.</p>
