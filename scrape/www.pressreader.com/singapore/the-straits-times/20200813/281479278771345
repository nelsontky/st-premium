    <p>Lo­cal di­rec­tor Jack Neo is not rest­ing on his lau­rels even af­ter 40 years in the entertainm­ent in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The 60-year-old re­cently re­signed from the pro­duc­tion house J Team Pro­duc­tions, which he founded, to be chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Asia Mo­men­tum Me­dia (AMM) – a sub­sidiary of Hong Kong’s broad­caster Asia Tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>His wife Irene Kng will now be in charge of J Team.</p>
    <p>In a tele­phone in­ter­view with The Straits Times, he says: “My dream at 60 is to help more peo­ple and help Sin­ga­pore entertainm­ent.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways felt like there are plenty of ‘crouch­ing tigers, hidden dragons’ in Sin­ga­pore – there are many highly skilled and tal­ented peo­ple here, but we don’t have many plat­forms and it is very hard for pro­duc­tion houses to make money too.”</p>
    <p>AMM has soft-launched an on­de­mand stream­ing app named AMM TV.</p>
    <p>While it of­fers pre-pro­duced con­tent like drama se­ri­als, it is touted as a “live-entertainm­ent app” where live pro­duc­tions will have their own ded­i­cated sec­tion.</p>
    <p>The app, which is avail­able for down­load, is cur­rently free, but will even­tu­ally move to a freemium model where free con­tent is of­fered along with pre­mium ser­vices for those who pay.</p>
    <p>“I have a soft spot for live shows. Per­son­ally, I have done live shows since 1979. (The char­ac­ter of) Liang Popo and (long-run­ning va­ri­ety show) Com­edy Night are all live entertainm­ent. Of course, at first it is scary, but we are trained in it,” says Neo.</p>
    <p>His first ma­jor project at AMM is a vir­tual tal­ent com­pe­ti­tion named Show Off Show, which aims to dis­cover in­di­vid­u­als who are pas­sion­ate about singing, act­ing, host­ing, danc­ing and live-stream­ing.</p>
    <p>The com­pe­ti­tion, which has at­tracted around 1,300 sub­mis­sions for its au­di­tions, was orig­i­nally meant to be an in-per­son pro­duc­tion, but was dis­rupted by the Covid-19 pan­demic. But Neo went ahead with it any­way, adapt­ing it for a vir­tual for­mat.</p>
    <p>“It was a bold but nec­es­sary move. We are mov­ing for­ward with the times,” he says.</p>
    <p>The episodes, which can each garner around 250,000 views for those in the Man­darin cat­e­gory and 44,000 views for the ones in the English cat­e­gory, are streamed live over YouTube, Face­book and the AMM app.</p>
    <p>Each win­ner will get $20,000 in cash and a po­ten­tial con­tract with AMM for the com­pany’s pro­duc­tions.</p>
    <p>Neo says of the tal­ent he is look­ing for: “Can you sell things? I think that is a good abil­ity now.</p>
    <p>“When peo­ple watch Wang Lei and his live-stream shows sell­ing fish, his cus­tomers don’t just want to buy fish, they are buy­ing an en­tire per­for­mance. I’m look­ing for some­one who can use his or her per­for­mance to con­nect with fans in this way.”</p>
    <p>He has strong feel­ings about the use of so­cial me­dia and tech­nol­ogy to stay en­gaged with audiences.</p>
    <p>As he em­pha­sises sev­eral times over the in­ter­view: “If you don’t have so­cial me­dia, you will get phased out. Any star who says he or she has no time or not enough knowl­edge to get on so­cial me­dia is sim­ply not keep­ing up with the times.”</p>
    <p>Fans of Neo’s films need not worry as he is not done with cin­ema.</p>
    <p>He says: “When there are in­vest­ments for me to make movies, I will still col­lab­o­rate with J Team and per­haps AMM can par­tic­i­pate too.”</p>
