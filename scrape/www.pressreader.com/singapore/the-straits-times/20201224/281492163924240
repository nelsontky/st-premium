    <p>One im­ported Covid-19 pa­tient in Sin­ga­pore has been con­firmed to be in­fected by a po­ten­tially more con­ta­gious strain of the coro­n­avirus spread­ing in Bri­tain. The Min­istry of Health said there is cur­rently no ev­i­dence that the strain is cir­cu­lat­ing in the com­mu­nity here.</p>
    <p>One case of a new coro­n­avirus strain re­ported in Bri­tain to be po­ten­tially more con­ta­gious has been de­tected here, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient is a 17-year-old Sin­ga­porean girl who had stud­ied in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said that with the B117 strain cir­cu­lat­ing in Bri­tain, the Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory is per­form­ing vi­ral ge­nomic se­quenc­ing for con­firmed Covid-19 cases who ar­rived from Europe re­cently.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 31 im­ported cases from Europe who ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore between Nov 17 and Dec 17 were con­firmed to have Covid-19 in­fec­tion this month. Among them, 12 were not in­fected with the B117 strain, and one pa­tient, iden­ti­fied as Case 58,504, has been found to be car­ry­ing the strain.</p>
    <p>Five sam­ples can­not be se­quenced due to their low vi­ral load, said MOH, which added that it is pend­ing con­fir­ma­tion of the re­sults for an­other 11 cases who are pre­lim­i­nar­ily pos­i­tive for the B117 strain.</p>
    <p>The last two cases have not been tested yet.</p>
    <p>MOH said there is cur­rently no ev­i­dence that the B117 strain is cir­cu­lat­ing in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“All the cases had been placed on 14-day stay-home no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties or iso­lated upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and their close con­tacts had been quar­an­tined ear­lier,” it added.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean who was in­fected with the B117 strain had been study­ing in Bri­tain since Au­gust. She re­turned to Sin­ga­pore on Dec 6 and served a stay-home no­tice at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity upon ar­rival.</p>
    <p>She de­vel­oped a fever the next day, and was con­firmed to have Covid-19 in­fec­tion on Dec 8, said MOH.</p>
    <p>Her case was in­cluded in the min­istry’s case count the same day.</p>
    <p>All her close con­tacts were quar­an­tined and tested neg­a­tive at the end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>“As she had been iso­lated upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, we were able to ringfence this case so that there was no fur­ther trans­mis­sion aris­ing from her,” MOH said.</p>
    <p>As a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure to re­duce the risk of B117 strain’s spread to Sin­ga­pore, the multi-min­istry task force com­bat­ing Covid-19 an­nounced on Tues­day that from 11.59pm yes­ter­day, all long-term pass hold­ers and short-term vis­i­tors with re­cent travel his­tory to Bri­tain within the last 14 days will not be al­lowed to en­ter or tran­sit through Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents re­turn­ing from Bri­tain are re­quired to un­dergo a Covid-19 test on ar­rival here at the start of their 14-day stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 21 new coro­n­avirus cases were an­nounced in Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day, all of them im­ported, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,482.</p>
    <p>All were placed on stay-home no­tice when they ar­rived here.</p>
    <p>Among them, three are Sin­ga­pore­ans and five are per­ma­nent res­i­dents who re­turned from Canada, In­dia and Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>An­other nine are for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers who ar­rived from Indonesia, In­dia and Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>Two are stu­dent’s pass hold­ers who ar­rived from In­dia, while the re­main­ing two cases are short­term visit pass hold­ers who ar­rived here from In­dia and Swe­den.</p>
    <p>No new com­mu­nity cases and none from within worker’s dor­mi­to­ries were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of one such case in the past week, who is cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>With 18 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,307 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 34 pa­tients re­mained in hospi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 97 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
