    <p>A Korean boyfriend work­ing as a doc­tor in a Malaysian hos­pi­tal in dire need of help. A mys­te­ri­ous, swoon-wor­thy Amer­i­can-Chi­nese man send­ing ex­pen­sive gifts from abroad. And the prom­ise of undy­ing love after a whirl­wind pro­posal from an el­i­gi­ble Malaysian bach­e­lor.</p>
    <p>They sound like cliches from soap op­eras, but on­line scam­mers have been re­ly­ing on these care­fully crafted pro­files to trick gullible women into part­ing with cash and kind.</p>
    <p>What these cases also have in com­mon is that they were all cracked by the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force’s Anti-Scam Cen­tre (ASC) – which has han­dled more than 8,600 scam re­ports in the one year since its es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>The ASC has also frozen more than 6,100 bank ac­counts and re­cov­ered more than $21.2 mil­lion that scam­mers, based both lo­cally and in­ter­na­tion­ally, might have other­wise made off with.</p>
    <p>The amount re­cov­ered is equiv­a­lent to around 40 per cent of some $52 mil­lion in funds that scam­mers pil­fered in the cases the ASC has han­dled since it started op­er­at­ing on June 18 last year. The re­main­ing 60 per cent of funds has not been re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>“Mov­ing for­ward, the ASC will con­tinue to strengthen our de­tec­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties, as well as en­hance our col­lab­o­ra­tion with more stake­hold­ers and for­eign law en­force­ment agen­cies, to dis</p>

    <p>Num­ber of scam re­ports that the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force’s Anti-Scam Cen­tre (ASC) has han­dled in the one year since its es­tab­lish­ment.</p>
    <p>rupt scam­mers’ op­er­a­tions and mit­i­gate vic­tims’ losses,” said Deputy As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner Aileen Yap, who is as­sis­tant di­rec­tor of the spe­cialised com­mer­cial crime di­vi­sion at the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Some meth­ods that the ASC has used to stop scam­mers in their tracks in­clude a net­work of 11 banks that as­sist in promptly freez­ing ac­counts and re­triev­ing bank ac­count hold­ers’ par­tic­u­lars when­ever un­usual trans­ac­tions are de­tected.</p>
    <p>This net­work, which in­cludes fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions like DBS Bank, OCBC Bank and United Over­seas Bank (UOB), helped the cen­tre nab a 39-year-old man in­volved in a mas­sive e-com­merce scam in midMarch. A French phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm was de­ceived into trans­fer­ring around €6.64 mil­lion (S$10.76 mil­lion) to a Sin­ga­pore bank ac­count to pay for a ship­ment of sur­gi­cal masks and sani­tis­ers.</p>
    <p>The ASC man­aged to re­trieve more than $6.4 mil­lion, its big­gest re­cov­ery so far. Around $5.3 mil­lion was re­cov­ered by UOB, which traced and froze the scam­mer’s ac­count within min­utes.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Soh, head of in­ves­ti­ga­tion at UOB’s in­te­grated fraud man­age­ment depart­ment, said scam­mers now pose a big­ger threat as they have de­vel­oped so­phis­ti­cated meth­ods to con­duct scams and cover their tracks.</p>
    <p>“One syn­di­cate might have mul­ti­ple ac­counts and var­i­ous money out­flows, mak­ing them harder to de­tect,” he said.</p>
    <p>As for love scams, the ASC has also man­aged to foil some within a day of the cases com­ing to its at­ten­tion: an ex­am­ple be­ing a case last month in­volv­ing three women.</p>
    <p>Two of the women – Ms Tan, 58, and Ms Lim, 50 – were at­tempt­ing to trans­fer $3,500 and $2,300 re­spec­tively, to help their on­line lovers pay off “Cus­toms charges” for gifts sup­pos­edly sent to them.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan thought that she was re­ceiv­ing a present from abroad from an Amer­i­can-born Chi­nese on­line lover, but it was re­ally a scam­mer us­ing pic­tures of a Korean man stolen off a pub­lic In­sta­gram pro­file.</p>
    <p>A 38-year-old wo­man known as Ms Koh was also duped into be­ing a money mule for the same syn­di­cate. Con­vinced she was help­ing her “Korean doc­tor boyfriend”, she ac­cepted and re­mit­ted around $5,300 de­posited into her ac­count from un­known sources.</p>
    <p>The ASC man­aged to re­cover the $2,300 trans­ferred by Ms Lim, and talked the other women out of giv­ing the scam­mers more cash.</p>
    <p>For­mer vic­tims say it is best to cut off all con­tact once scam­mers ask for money.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions ex­ec­u­tive Es­ther Teoh, 27, was ap­proached by a “Korean” man on Tin­der, who after four months of chat­ting asked her to trans­fer $2,000 to a bank ac­count in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>She did not do so and promptly blocked the man.</p>
    <p>“Once he asked me for money, I saw a se­ri­ous red flag. I en­cour­age every­one to look out for warn­ing signs, and not be blink­ered by false af­fec­tion,” Ms Teoh said.</p>

    <p>HARDER TO DE­TECT</p>
