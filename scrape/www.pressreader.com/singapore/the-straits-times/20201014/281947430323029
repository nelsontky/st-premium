    <p>DHAKA • Bangladesh’s Cab­i­net on Mon­day ap­proved the death penalty for rapists amid na­tion­wide protests in the wake of a se­ries of gang rapes and sex­ual as­saults.</p>
    <p>Bangladesh has seen a surge of sex­ual crimes i n re­cent years, with nearly 1,000 in­ci­dents re­ported be­tween Jan­uary and last month, more than a fifth of them gang rapes, ac­cord­ing to human rights group Ain-o-Sal­ish Ken­dra.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts said tougher penal­ties would not be enough to tackle the prob­lem and the author­i­ties need to im­me­di­ately ad­dress the coun­try’s sys­temic prob­lems in rape tri­als and their ex­tremely low con­vic­tion rates. Rights ac­tivists blame the num­ber of as­saults on a cul­ture of im­punity and pro­tec­tion of sus­pects by in­flu­en­tial in­di­vid­u­als for po­lit­i­cal rea­sons.</p>
    <p>The Cab­i­net, chaired by Prime Min­is­ter Sheikh Hasina, ap­proved the pro­posal to make death the high­est pun­ish­ment for rape, Law Min­is­ter Anisul Huq said. “The law needed to be amended quickly... (Cab­i­net) has de­cided an or­di­nance will be pro­mul­gated to­mor­row, with the ap­proval of the Pres­i­dent, as the Par­lia­ment is not hold­ing ses­sions cur­rently.”</p>
    <p>The lat­est out­pour­ing of na­tional anger was sparked by a video of a group of men strip­ping and at­tack­ing a woman for al­most half an hour in the south­ern dis­trict of Noakhali. An in­ves­ti­ga­tion by an au­ton­o­mous state body, the Na­tional Human Rights Com­mis­sion, found that the woman had been raped re­peat­edly and ter­rorised with weapons over the last year. “No mercy to rapists,” shouted pro­test­ers gath­ered in the cap­i­tal Dhaka and else­where, hun­dreds of women and stu­dents among them. Many car­ried plac­ards bear­ing mes­sages such as “Stop rape cul­ture”.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery day, news­pa­pers carry fresh sto­ries of sex­ual vi­o­lence against women,” said Ms Sa­hana Is­lam, a univer­sity stu­dent, who joined the protests. “I fear I am next. I want death penalty for the rapists so the rest of the in­hu­man creeps can learn what will hap­pen to them if they ever dare to do it.”</p>
    <p>When sur­vivors file a com­plaint for sex­ual as­sault in Bangladesh, pros­e­cu­tion is very rare and takes years to com­plete, and the con­vic­tion rate in tri­als that do go to court is very low. In ad­di­tion, many rapes go un­re­ported be­cause women fear be­ing stig­ma­tised.</p>
