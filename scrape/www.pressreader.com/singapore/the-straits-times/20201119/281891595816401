    <p>The street protests in Thai­land and the un­prece­dented public crit­i­cism of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn fo­cus at­ten­tion on an in­sti­tu­tion whose days, along with old-style feu­dal­ism, are fad­ing, if not gone altogether.</p>
    <p>Democrati­sa­tion of ed­u­ca­tion and in­for­ma­tion is now so much a part of daily ex­is­tence, as nat­u­ral as breath­ing, that we take these priv­i­leges for granted.</p>
    <p>So, too, the coin’s other side, free­dom of ex­pres­sion. In­deed, so­cial me­dia has raised this to the level of a near threat to demo­cratic so­ci­ety with its ten­dency to fos­ter ir­rev­er­ence, half-truths and un­truths.</p>
    <p>Still, the odd monar­chy ex­ists, although in­creas­ingly in tit­u­lar form or as a for­mal­ity. The es­tab­lish­ment in­sid­ers who have read the tea leaves have learnt to pre­serve what­ever’s left of the in­sti­tu­tion by largely get­ting out of the way of the com­mon crush.</p>
    <p>In Liar’s Poker, Michael Lewis’ hu­mor­ously in­sight­ful book on Wall Street’s go-go years in the 1980s, a Salomon Brothers man­ag­ing di­rec­tor’s wife, in­vited to Buck­ing­ham Palace for a fund-rais­ing din­ner, shouts out to the Queen Mother pass­ing by with her cor­gis: “Hey Queen, nice dogs you have there.”</p>
    <p>The Queen Mother doesn’t miss a step and ig­nores the cry.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can cap­i­tal­ism and Bri­tish aris­toc­racy had flown their colours side by side; the Salomon Brothers wife by hol­ler­ing, the Queen Mother by ig­nor­ing it. Un­sur­pris­ingly, both in­sti­tu­tions thrive.</p>
    <p>In­deed, every US pres­i­dent – Demo­crat or Repub­li­can – has craved a state visit to Bri­tain, which usu­ally comes with din­ner and a stay at Buck­ing­ham Palace.</p>
    <p>Shunned by Bos­ton’s An­glo-Saxon elite, pres­i­dent John F. Kennedy’s fa­ther Joseph Kennedy, who was of Ir­ish</p>
    <p>Catholic de­scent, was said to have ruled Lon­don’s diplo­matic cir­cles as Franklin Roo­sevelt’s am­bas­sador to the Court of St James’s.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can elite’s ten­dency to tag numeral suf­fixes to their names – think Henry Ford II – sug­gests a se­cret yearn­ing to be like the ti­tled, if no longer as en­ti­tled, class of the old coun­try.</p>
    <p>ASIAN MONAR­CHIES</p>
    <p>Like the peo­ple of their coun­tries, kings, emirs and roy­alty across Asia have not been spared the tu­mult of the past quar­ter cen­tury.</p>
    <p>So­cial and po­lit­i­cal up­heavals, scan­dals and the rav­ages of age have seen some un­ex­pected de­par­tures from the throne.</p>
    <p>In 2001, a palace mas­sacre in Nepal by the Crown Prince wiped out King Biren­dra, his wife and his daugh­ter, and sev­eral close kin. The Prince him­self, mor­tally wounded, was in­stalled as King while in a coma and died with­out ever open­ing his eyes again.</p>
    <p>Prince Gya­nen­dra, King Biren­dra’s younger brother, who suc­ceeded to the throne, lasted a mere seven years be­fore be­ing ousted by a demo­cratic up­surge, end­ing the Nepalese monar­chy.</p>
    <p>Cam­bo­dia’s of­fi­cial name is the King­dom of Cam­bo­dia. While the cur­rent monarch hap­pens to be the son of King Norodom Si­hanouk, the po­si­tion is now wholly tit­u­lar. The in­cum­bent is picked by the Royal Coun­cil of the Throne and does not nec­es­sar­ily have to be the first in line.</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, the much-loved Em­peror Ak­i­hito, cit­ing poor health, chose to ab­di­cate, ini­ti­at­ing a new Ja­panese era with the as­cent of Em­peror Naruhito last year.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s con­sti­tu­tional monarch, Sul­tan Muham­mad V of Ke­lan­tan, also stepped down in the same year, in a move that stunned his na­tion.</p>
    <p>Where mon­archs still ex­ist in Asia, out­side the Arab world, only one – in Brunei – has ab­so­lute power.</p>
    <p>But quite apart from all of the above, there is also a monar­chy in thinly pop­u­lated Bhutan, the land­locked Hi­malayan state sand­wiched be­tween China and In­dia known in the lo­cal lan­guage as Druk Yul, Land of the Thun­der Dragon.</p>
    <p>Like Thai­land, it is a Bud­dhist na­tion, but the sim­i­lar­i­ties sub­stan­tially end there.</p>
    <p>Small as Bhutan may be, the way its mon­archs have held them­selves and con­nected with the peo­ple hold lessons in the way in­sti­tu­tions can be pre­served if their in­cum­bents know how to move with the times.</p>
    <p>A street protest against King Jigme Kh­e­sar Nam­gyel Wangchuck, for in­stance, would be un­think­able.</p>
    <p>In the months past, as Covid-19 raged, King Jigme Kh­e­sar and his fa­ther, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who stepped down in 2008, have toured the na­tion check­ing on pa­tients, fre­quently draw­ing tears of grat­i­tude from the sick.</p>
    <p>And Bhutan prob­a­bly has the low­est cor­rup­tion lev­els in South Asia. Some weeks ago, the Home Min­is­ter was found guilty by the High Court for mak­ing false in­sur­ance claims on his Toy­ota Prado land cruiser and given a two-month jail sen­tence.</p>
    <p>It is not that Bhutan’s kings have not had their salad days. The fourth King, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, was known to favour dan­ger­ous sports like rock climb­ing in his teens and would tear around the moun­tains on a high-speed mo­tor­cy­cle.</p>
    <p>THE BHUTAN WAY</p>
    <p>But the high jinks ended with the on­set of re­spon­si­bil­ity. When in his late 20s, the well-mus­cled fourth King com­bined the grace of a pan­ther with the air and self-pos­ses­sion of some­one three decades older, a trait he has passed on to his son, the 40-year-old cur­rent King, or K-5, as the Bhutanese some­times re­fer to him.</p>
    <p>I have been trav­el­ling to Bhutan since 1985, when K-4, in a long in­ter­view, re­vealed his plans to bring Bhutan out of its self-im­posed iso­la­tion and into moder­nity, a process that be­gan ten­ta­tively with his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>In do­ing so, King Jigme Singye, still un­der 30 years old at the time, was re­spond­ing to the urges of his cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Un­til then, tele­vi­sion had been banned in the king­dom, ap­par­ently to keep out pol­lut­ing out­side in­flu­ences.</p>
    <p>Two years be­fore that, Druk Air was launched with Dornier 228 air­craft, the flights ini­tially con­nect­ing Paro in Bhutan to Kolkata in In­dia, then adding des­ti­na­tions as the first jets ar­rived in the fleet in 1988.</p>
    <p>Re­form is never easy, es­pe­cially for monar­chies. It cer­tainly helps if it is ini­ti­ated by rulers who can count on the re­spect of their sub­jects. To be loved, you need to be rooted, and show it. Bhutanese kings know this by in­stinct.</p>
    <p>K-4, ed­u­cated in Heather­down Prepara­tory School in Eng­land, North Point in Dar­jeel­ing, In­dia, and a school in Bhutan where he was de­lib­er­ately bunched with or­di­nary Bhutanese youth, rarely left his king­dom, even for a hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>When I asked why, his re­sponse was that there was no bet­ter place for a hol­i­day than his own coun­try.</p>
    <p>A log cabin up in the moun­tains was where he spent most of his nights, not the mas­sive river­side palace down in na­tional cap­i­tal Thim­phu.</p>
    <p>But Bhutan’s big­gest lessons in monar­chi­cal preser­va­tion per­haps lie in know­ing to let go in time and in a man­ner so that peo­ple de­mand you stay on.</p>
    <p>In 2008, the year King Jigme Singye made way for his son, Bhutan moved from an ab­so­lute to a con­sti­tu­tional monar­chy, hold­ing its first elec­tions to the Na­tional Assem­bly that March.</p>
    <p>While the de­ci­sion had been an­nounced two years ear­lier, to the puz­zle­ment and dis­may of most Bhutanese, the King had pos­si­bly fore­seen that the times were changing.</p>
    <p>Two months after Bhutan’s first na­tional elec­tion, King Gya­nen­dra was top­pled in neigh­bour­ing Nepal by a Maoist-led demo­cratic move­ment.</p>
    <p>Bhutan’s fifth and cur­rent King is very much his fa­ther’s son. Like his fa­ther, he is steeped in the coun­try’s Bud­dhist tra­di­tions even as his ed­u­ca­tional pro­file has deep lev­els of Western­i­sa­tion, in­clud­ing Phillips Academy in An­dover and Wheaton Col­lege in Mas­sachusetts, both in the United States, and Ox­ford Univer­sity’s Mag­dalen Col­lege.</p>
    <p>Fa­ther and son, de­spite their ex­po­sure to Western ed­u­ca­tion, are al­ways seen clad in Bhutanese cos­tume.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, King Jigme Kh­e­sar, ad­dress­ing the peo­ple on the 12th an­niver­sary of his coro­na­tion, vowed that “I will never rule you as a king. I will pro­tect you as a par­ent, care for you as a brother and serve you as a son. I shall give you ev­ery­thing and keep noth­ing; I shall live such a life as a good hu­man be­ing that you may find it wor­thy to serve as an ex­am­ple for your chil­dren”.</p>
    <p>It is not that the Bhutanese monar­chy does not make mis­takes. Forestry ex­perts say that the rul­ing fam­ily’s overly con­ser­va­tion­ist in­stincts to­wards the coun­try’s lush forests pre­vent any gov­ern­ment at­tempt to mean­ing­fully de­velop the forestry in­dus­try, or cull sick trees – which is nec­es­sary to pre­serve the health of other trees.</p>
    <p>To be sure, com­par­isons can be odi­ous and there is lit­tle ques­tion that we are talk­ing of sit­u­a­tions of dif­fer­ent scales here.</p>
    <p>The crit­i­cal point, though, is that the times are a-changin’, and power and in­flu­ence arise these days more from per­sonal con­duct and pop­u­lar per­cep­tion of a ruler’s cor­rect in­stincts than no­tions of divine right and ar­cane trap­pings of royal con­sorts and courtiers crawl­ing be­fore a seated king.</p>
    <p>Kings and em­per­ors may have be­come sub­stan­tially passe, but to mil­lions they still count. At a time of in­tense change and dis­rup­tion, mil­lions find in their pres­ence moor­ings and a re­as­sur­ing link con­nect­ing the present to the past.</p>
    <p>But to gain true af­fec­tion from the peo­ple, mon­archs will have to find their own con­nec­tions be­yond the power of in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>The late King Bhu­mi­bol Adulyadej of Thai­land found his from his fre­quent trav­els within his coun­try to talk to agri­cul­tur­ists and com­mon folk.</p>
    <p>In the uni­verse of monar­chies there are none, not even the Bri­tish, who come with the re­fine­ment of Ja­panese roy­als.</p>
    <p>For those look­ing for a les­son in im­pe­rial cour­tesy, check out the footage of Em­peror Ak­i­hito, then 78 years old, kneel­ing on the ground to make eye con­tact with vic­tims of the 2011 tsunami in a refugee camp.</p>
    <p>It will teach you some­thing about adapt­ing the man­ner born to con­tem­po­rary times.</p>
