    <p>HONG KONG • The Hong Kong Mon­e­tary Author­ity’s ( HKMA) move to re­lax loan rules for the first time in more than a decade is un­likely to pro­vide a sig­nif­i­cant boost for a com­mer­cial prop­erty mar­ket bat­tered by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and a deep re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s cen­tral bank late on Wed­nes­day raised the loan-to­value ra­tio cap for com­mer­cial prop­er­ties to 50 per cent from 40 per cent, al­low­ing buy­ers to bor­row more money to pur­chase of­fice and re­tail space. The move went into ef­fect yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tain­ties in the real es­tate mar­ket, in­clud­ing the pan­demic and es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions be­tween China and the United States, have prompted banks to be con­ser­va­tive in com­mer­cial mort­gage lend­ing and have even raised rates re­cently, ac­cord­ing to Cen­taline Mort­gage Bro­ker man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ivy Wong.</p>
    <p>“The mea­sure won’t turn the mar­ket around,” though it will pro­vide some sup­port, Ms Wong said. “Bor­row­ers are still sub­ject to re­stric­tions like stress tests, and many in­vestors are look­ing for re­cov­ery signs be­fore they make pur­chases.”</p>
    <p>The last time the mon­e­tary author­ity lifted the loan limit was in 2009, after the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis. It was later low­ered to 40 per cent in 2013 when the prop­erty mar­ket was deemed over­heated.</p>
    <p>“With busi­ness con­fi­dence con­tin­u­ing to be af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic and ris­ing geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions, non-res­i­den­tial prop­erty mar­kets are likely to re­main un­der pres­sure,”</p>
    <p>HKMA said. It is ap­pro­pri­ate to ease the mort­gage mea­sures for non-res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties in the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment, it added.</p>
    <p>This is aimed at re­liev­ing pres­sure for prop­erty own­ers strug­gling to re­pay mort­gages as rental in­come de­clines, said Knight Frank ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Thomas Lam. The re­lax­ation is un­likely to lead to an ex­plo­sion of loans or a boom­ing prop­erty mar­ket, Ms Wong said.</p>
    <p>Un­like the res­i­den­tial mar­ket, which has been largely re­silient thanks to pent-up de­mand, com­mer­cial real es­tate has taken a hit. Of­fice and re­tail space trans­ac­tion value and vol­ume fell by 55 per cent and 41 per cent, re­spec­tively, in the first half of the year from a year ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to Sav­ills.</p>
    <p>Pro­longed so­cial un­rest and travel re­stric­tions have de­terred many over­seas in­vestors. Main­land Chi­nese buy­ers, who were the main source of in­bound real es­tate in­vest­ment over the past decade, were ab­sent in the first quar­ter, the first time since 2009.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s land­lords, who tra­di­tion­ally ben­e­fit from their well­lo­cated shop­ping malls, are also suf­fer­ing from the ef­fects of the pan­demic. Wharf Real Es­tate In­vest­ment this month recorded a HK$7.4 bil­lion (S$1.3 bil­lion) loss in its port­fo­lio value, and the stock plunged 35 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment last week re­vised its 2020 fore­cast for the econ­omy to shrink a record 6 per cent to 8 per cent from an ear­lier es­ti­mate of 4 per cent to 7 per cent be­cause of the coro­n­avirus and ris­ing trade ten­sions.</p>
