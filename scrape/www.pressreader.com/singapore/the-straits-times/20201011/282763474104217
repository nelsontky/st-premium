    <p>When Bri­tish teacher Kiran Cooli­can hur­riedly left Chengdu at the on­set of China’s coro­n­avirus out­break in Jan­uary to take on a new job in Spain, he did not ex­pect that he would be quickly laid off and end up job­less for the next eight months.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old was teach­ing English on a one-year con­tract at a pri­vate school in Sichuan’s cap­i­tal Chengdu when he se­cured a new job to teach the sub­ject at school camps in Spain from March to Au­gust.</p>
    <p>“I took the painful de­ci­sion to end my con­tract (with the school in Chengdu) at the end of Jan­uary be­cause I was deeply con­cerned that the sit­u­a­tion in China would get out of con­trol, and the Span­ish com­pany would refuse to al­low me to work for them,” Mr Cooli­can says.</p>
    <p>But lit­tle did he know that the coro­n­avirus had al­ready crossed China’s bor­ders into coun­tries across the globe, and that Spain would end up be­com­ing one of the worst-hit na­tions in the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Just two weeks af­ter Mr Cooli­can started work­ing in Spain, he was axed.</p>
    <p>Spain had recorded its first coro­n­avirus case on Jan 31. In less than two months, the num­ber of in­fec­tions shot up to 46,621 to be­come the high­est in Europe, prompt­ing the govern­ment to im­pose a na­tion­wide lock­down on March 14.</p>
    <p>“I ap­plied for sev­eral more jobs in Spain and was hired by a school,” he says. “Dev­as­tat­ingly, how­ever, they in­formed me that they were not able to re­cruit me for the en­tire cur­rent aca­demic year due to Covid-re­lated fi­nan­cial is­sues.”</p>
    <p>Mr Cooli­can was forced to re­turn to Bri­tain and had al­most given up hope of find­ing a new job when he got an of­fer in the mid­dle of last month to teach in Italy.</p>
    <p>“(Covid-19) has de­railed my short-term ca­reer and life plans, as I now have to first com­plete an un­ex­pected stint in Italy for two to three years,” he says.</p>
    <p>“I still want to move to Spain and set­tle down once the pan­demic is over. I hope my life will con­tinue the way it did pre-pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Mr Cooli­can’s story is just one of many, as the pan­demic drove mil­lions of ex­pa­tri­ates back to their home coun­tries world­wide.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has lim­ited the move­ment of 7.2 bil­lion peo­ple, or 93 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion, as coun­tries have been forced to re­strict their bor­der cross­ings to pre­vent the spread of the deadly dis­ease, ac­cord­ing to an analysis by Pew Re­search Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>As peo­ple stay home, busi­nesses suf­fer. Jobs are elim­i­nated and in­ter­nal trans­fers are frozen.</p>
    <p>Would-be ex­pa­tri­ates are not trav­el­ling and the ex­ist­ing ones are pack­ing up due to health fears and re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>In Asia, there are no clear sta­tis­tics on how many ex­pa­tri­ates have left. But there has been a con­sis­tent de­cline in their num­bers and their hir­ing across ev­ery market, though on a smaller scale due largely to a high level of trust in the gov­ern­ments that have kept the cri­sis un­der con­trol with clear and con­sis­tent guide­lines and safety mea­sures, says Mr Toby Fowl­ston, chief ex­ec­u­tive of re­cruit­ment agency Robert Wal­ters.</p>
    <p>Some left be­cause they were fur­loughed. Oth­ers did so be­cause they wanted to be closer to their el­derly par­ents and fam­i­lies back home, he notes. He over­sees 13 coun­tries in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>Their de­par­ture will leave a last­ing im­pact in post-pan­demic Asia, but when things pick up, go­ing by their com­ments, they would like to re­turn, though the roles be­ing of­fered then may be dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>TEACH­ERS AMONG MOST AF­FECTED</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, when it be­came clear that the coro­n­avirus was spi­ralling out of con­trol in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan – the ini­tial epi­cen­tre of the pan­demic – coun­tries across the world scram­bled to evacuate their cit­i­zens, who made up some 1.03 mil­lion in­ter­na­tional mi­grants in China.</p>
    <p>Anec­dotes of ex­pa­tri­ates who missed their flights and were stranded in the locked-down city spread on the In­ter­net like the virus it­self.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers who work in in­ter­na­tional schools in China have been among the ex­pa­tri­ates most af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Many in­ter­na­tional schools in the re­gion have had their en­rol­ments slashed by as much as 30 per cent this year, ac­cord­ing to ISC Re­search.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents were drop­ping out at short no­tice be­cause their par­ents were leav­ing. And par­ents de­manded re­im­burse­ments or re­funds as cam­puses were or­dered to close.</p>
    <p>These schools are hav­ing trou­ble keep­ing the teach­ers on their pay­roll.</p>
    <p>One 40-year-old teacher from New Zealand says he has been stuck in his home coun­try since his fam­ily left Shen­zhen in Guang­dong prov­ince in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The teacher, who did not want to be named, adds that the com­pany he worked for, which runs an in­ter­na­tional school in Shen­zhen, froze salaries for teach­ers this year, which meant he did not get a 35 per cent pay rise that he was promised be­fore Covid-19 hit.</p>
    <p>But he counts him­self lucky, con­sid­er­ing other schools have re­trenched teach­ers or cut salaries.</p>
    <p>“The good thing is that the school made the call to try and keep as many em­ploy­ees as it could.</p>
    <p>“I guess we all had to take a hit so we could keep all the teach­ers on board,” he says, adding that he has ap­plied for a new visa to re-en­ter the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Many ex­pa­tri­ates who had their jobs lined up i n Asia sud­denly found those po­si­tions elim­i­nated as com­pa­nies shifted their pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>When the coro­n­avirus was first re­ported in Jan­uary, Ethan (not his real name), a tech ex­ec­u­tive based in Cal­i­for­nia, was dili­gently learn­ing Can­tonese in prepa­ra­tion for a post­ing to Hong Kong. His ap­pli­ca­tion for an in­ter­nal trans­fer was ap­proved and he was ex­cited to re­unite with his fi­ancee, who had moved to the city six months ear­lier.</p>
    <p>But his plans were shat­tered just a week be­fore his de­par­ture when he was told his po­si­tion was no longer avail­able.</p>
    <p>“They told me the po­si­tion had been ‘de-pri­ori­tised’. And I was ab­so­lutely dev­as­tated,” he tells In­sight.</p>
    <p>“I bade farewell to every­body, can­celled my rent and packed my bags. (My fi­ancee and I) were plan­ning to get mar­ried this year in Hong Kong and all that was thrown out of the win­dow,” Ethan says.</p>
    <p>He has been ac­tively look­ing for a job in Hong Kong since but his search has yielded noth­ing so far.</p>
    <p>“The com­pa­nies aren’t hir­ing and the ones that do are look­ing for can­di­dates who can speak Man­darin or who al­ready have a res­i­dence per­mit,” he notes.</p>
    <p>As ex­pa­tri­ates leave Asia, they are leav­ing be­hind rental prop­er­ties for which there are few tak­ers.</p>
    <p>In Kuala Lumpur, the av­er­age ask­ing rents in up­mar­ket sub­urbs Am­pang Hilir and Da­mansara Heights – pop­u­lar among ex­pa­tri­ates – have de­clined in the first half of this year, as there was lower de­mand from ex­pa­tri­ates and cor­po­rate ten­ants, a re­port by real es­tate con­sul­tancy Knight Frank Malaysia noted.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing, rentals in high-end res­i­den­tial ar­eas have been fall­ing by as much as 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>“For­eign­ers are not com­ing in and some apart­ments have been empty for half a year. Rents are drop­ping but no one is com­ing in,” says Bei­jing prop­erty agent Zhao Xu. Ex­pa­tri­ates make up 80 per cent of her clients.</p>
    <p>MANY EX­PA­TRI­ATES PRE­FER TO STAY</p>
    <p>The lives of these ex­pa­tri­ates may be dis­rupted but the toll the pan­demic has taken on them is far less se­vere than it has been on lowwage labour mi­grants, who do not have that many op­tions.</p>
    <p>Says As­sis­tant Professor Ye Jun­jia from the School of So­cial Sci­ences at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity: “Be­cause of the way our sys­tem is set up to ac­com­mo­date tran­sient mi­grants, the im­pact of the pan­demic is greater felt by the mi­grant work­ers than for­eign pro­fes­sion­als. (They) don’t have the priv­i­lege to work from home, (or) work from another coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Many Asian cities re­main af­ford­able for ex­pa­tri­ates even if they have to take a pay cut. Many In­sight spoke to chose to stay put be­cause it is safer to be in Asia, where the virus is largely un­der con­trol. And they are likely to be re­hired when the re­gion re­cov­ers from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As Mr Fowl­ston points out, the cur­rent cri­sis is driven by a health emer­gency and not a fi­nan­cial melt­down. Some com­pa­nies will still have cash on their bal­ance sheets and they are still hir­ing.</p>
    <p>But the hir­ing poli­cies of these com­pa­nies and how they op­er­ate in the post-pan­demic world will change.</p>
    <p>CHANGES AHEAD</p>
    <p>A sur­vey by The Adecco Group re­cruit­ment agency showed a majority (55 per cent) of em­ploy­ees ex­pect that a pro­por­tion of their work­ing time will be spent at home, as com­pa­nies are more likely to al­low flex­i­ble work­place ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies are also more likely to spread de­ci­sion-making power across the or­gan­i­sa­tion so re­gional op­er­a­tions are less de­pen­dent on ex­ec­u­tives based in the head­quar­ters on the other side of the globe.</p>
    <p>“They have come to re­alise that it is im­por­tant not to run their op­er­a­tions from the head­quar­ters and they will want to em­power lo­cal lead­ers who are able to see what is hap­pen­ing on the ground, un­der­stand the sit­u­a­tion and make im­por­tant de­ci­sions,” says Mr Fowl­ston.</p>
    <p>He adds that while some roles in the tra­di­tional market such as re­tail and avi­a­tion may be com­ing to an end, huge in­vest­ments are be­ing poured into tal­ent in crit­i­cal sec­tors such as tech, cy­ber se­cu­rity, com­pli­ance, reg­u­la­tory and health­care.</p>
    <p>So, will ex­pa­tri­ates re­turn to Asia? They most cer­tainly will. But they are more likely to take on dif­fer­ent roles and less likely to be sta­tioned in one place for an ex­tended pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has be­gun to al­low ex­pa­tri­ates and pro­fes­sional visit pass hold­ers from 23 coun­tries to en­ter.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, China an­nounced on Sept 23 that for­eign­ers with valid res­i­dence per­mits can en­ter the coun­try for work with­out ap­ply­ing for new visas.</p>
    <p>If their per­mits had ex­pired af­ter the March sus­pen­sion, these for­eign­ers will be able to ap­ply for new visas, although they will still have to com­plete a 14-day quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>As bor­der con­trols be­gin to ease, many ex­pa­tri­ates are more hope­ful than ever that they will be able to re­turn to Asia soon.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one wants to get back, we’re all ex­cited about it,” says the hope­ful teacher from New Zealand.</p>
