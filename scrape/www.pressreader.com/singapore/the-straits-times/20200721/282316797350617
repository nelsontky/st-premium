    <p>PARIS • Lionel Messi fin­ished as La Liga’s top scorer for a record seventh time on Sun­day, net­ting twice as de­throned cham­pi­ons Barcelona ended their dis­ap­point­ing league cam­paign with a 5-0 win at Alaves.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gentina for­ward also be­came the first player to notch at least 20 as­sists and 20 goals in the Span­ish top flight, over­tak­ing for­mer team­mate Xavi (20) by one for the most num­ber of goals laid on in a sin­gle sea­son.</p>
    <p>But nei­ther his tally of 25 league strikes nor his other i ndi­vid­ual marks will form part of the judg­ing cri­te­ria to de­ter­mine the Bal­lon d’Or af­ter or­gan­is­ers yes­ter­day said that there will be no award this year due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The ac­co­lade, voted for by jour­nal­ists around the world in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, is widely con­sid­ered to be foot­ball’s great­est in­di­vid­ual hon­our, ahead of the Best Fifa Men’s Player prize.</p>
    <p>Messi has won the Bal­lon d’Or a record six times, one more than Por­tuguese ri­val Cris­tiano Ron­aldo of Ju­ven­tus.</p>
    <p>Only once in the past 12 years has the Barcelona skip­per not fea­tured in the top three and de­spite the Cata­lan giants’ fail­ure to win any do­mes­tic tro­phies this term, he still would have been a hot favourite to re­tain the award.</p>
    <p>Ron­aldo, who can still help his side win the Serie A and Cham­pi­ons League dou­ble this year, would have been a strong con­tender too.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern Mu­nich hit­man Robert Le­wandowski, who has 51 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions and can still win the tre­ble, will be dis­ap­pointed not to win his first top-three nom­i­na­tion, as will sev­eral mem­bers of Liver­pool’s Premier League ti­tle-win­ning squad.</p>
    <p>Not since 1956, when English­man Stan­ley Matthews won the in­au­gu­ral edi­tion, has a win­ner not been named, some­thing that the or­gan­iser, France Foot­ball mag­a­zine, blamed on the “ex­tra­or­di­nary con­di­tions” wrought by the Covid pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“There will be no edi­tion in 2020, be­cause it turns out, af­ter thought­ful con­sid­er­a­tion, that all the con­di­tions are not met,” said ed­i­tor Pas­cal Ferre.</p>
    <p>The out­break saw all ma­jor foot­ball leagues shut down in March, with the Ger­man Bun­desliga the first to re­sume be­hind closed doors in May, fol­lowed by La Liga, Serie A and the Premier League a month later.</p>
    <p>How­ever, France Foot­ball said it would be un­fair to vote to de­ter­mine who is the world’s best player when some leagues, in­clud­ing the French Ligue 1 and the Dutch Ere­di­visie, can­celled their sea­sons early.</p>
    <p>Ferre also sug­gested that it would not be right to judge play­ers based on games played with­out spec­ta­tors pre­sent.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve such a sin­gu­lar year can­not... be treated as an or­di­nary year,” he added, be­fore ref­er­enc­ing the closed-door con­di­tions, the al­lowance of five sub­sti­tu­tions and the re­for­mat­ting of the Cham­pi­ons League to a knock­out com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“Two months (Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary), out of the 11 gen­er­ally re­quired to form an opin­ion and de­cide who should lift the tro­phies, rep­re­sent far too lit­tle to gauge and judge.</p>
    <p>“With­out for­get­ting the other games were played – or will be played – in un­usual con­di­tions.”</p>
    <p>The women’s Bal­lon d’Or, which was first awarded in 2018, has also been can­celled, as has the Kepa Tro­phy, given to the best young player, along with the Yashin award for the world’s best goal­keeper.</p>
    <p>“This de­ci­sion, which was taken of course with all the group stake­hold­ers, does not de­light us, but it seems to be the most re­spon­si­ble one,” said Ferre.</p>
    <p>“Pro­tect­ing the cred­i­bil­ity and le­git­i­macy of such an award also means en­sur­ing its flaw­less­ness over time.”</p>
    <p>France Foot­ball added that it was look­ing for­ward to hold­ing a cer­e­mony next year, but that this year, it would in­stead or­gan­ise a vote for the all-time great­est men’s XI.</p>
