    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Fresh off his maiden Ma­jor win, power-hit­ting golfer Bryson DeCham­beau finds him­self in a rarest of cir­cum­stances: He is feel­ing re­laxed.</p>
    <p>It is a wel­come re­prieve for the metic­u­lously data-driven world No. 6, who over­hauled his body this year to add power to his drives and claimed the US Open crown by a six-stroke mar­gin at a chal­leng­ing Winged Foot course.</p>
    <p>“It was cer­tainly for me per­son­ally a win that al­lowed me to be com­fort­able with be­ing in my own skin and what I do,” said the 27-year-old, who felt the pres­sure of clinch­ing a Ma­jor ti­tle after six prior PGA Tour wins.</p>
    <p>Get­ting that “mon­key off my back”, said DeCham­beau, was a game changer ahead of the Mas­ters, which tees off next week.</p>
    <p>“When I look at Au­gusta, I re­ally think I’m go­ing to be a lot more re­laxed go­ing into this tour­na­ment, I won’t be as force­ful some­times as I have been in cer­tain Ma­jors that have caused me not to play my best,” he said. “Ob­vi­ously hav­ing a to­tally new game is nice... (I can) think about the golf course dif­fer­ently. I usu­ally play pretty well on new golf cour­ses so for me this feels like a new golf course and a new op­por­tu­nity to do some­thing pretty spe­cial.”</p>
    <p>The Mas­ters has been played at the Au­gusta Na­tional Golf Club in Ge­or­gia since 1934 but will move for­ward with­out fans in at­ten­dance this year due to the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>DeCham­beau is not com­pet­ing at this week’s Hous­ton Open, which starts to­day.</p>
    <p>Fel­low Amer­i­can Harry Higgs has with­drawn from the tour­na­ment after test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the PGA Tour said on Tues­day. Higgs last played at the Zozo Cham­pi­onship last month where he tied for 54th.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 Dustin John­son, how­ever, will be glad to fi­nally get back on course in Hous­ton.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old makes his first ap­pear­ance since fin­ish­ing tied sixth in the US Open in Septem­ber, hav­ing been forced to miss his planned Au­gusta warm-ups at the CJ Cup and Zozo Cham­pi­onship after test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>John­son has not fin­ished out­side the top 10 in his last four Mas­ters, with a best of tied sec­ond be­hind Tiger Woods last year. And if he suc­cess­fully shakes off the rust this week, he could put him­self in great shape for a crack at a maiden green jacket.</p>
