    <p>Govern­ment sup­port buys time for com­pa­nies to re-strate­gise, pur­sue al­ter­na­tive busi­ness mod­els, ex­plore op­por­tu­ni­ties and pur­sue in­ter­nal trans­for­ma­tion. How­ever, given that the weak avi­a­tion mar­ket will per­sist for an­other few years, some com­pa­nies may even­tu­ally be forced to trim their work­force after ex­haust­ing other av­enues.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion and aero­space com­pa­nies will con­tinue with their cost-cut­ting ef­forts, in­clud­ing re­trench­ments, even as they get much-needed help from schemes such as the ex­tended wage sup­port pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Bot­tom lines con­tinue to be dec­i­mated while the Covid-19 pan­demic rages on, with a full re­cov­ery for air travel nowhere in sight.</p>
    <p>Mr Sia Kheng Yok, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Aero­space In­dus­tries (Sin­ga­pore), or AAIS, said: “Govern­ment sup­port buys time for com­pa­nies to re-strate­gise, pur­sue al­ter­na­tive busi­ness mod­els, ex­plore op­por­tu­ni­ties and pur­sue in­ter­nal trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, given that the weak avi­a­tion mar­ket will per­sist for an­other few years, some com­pa­nies may even­tu­ally be forced to trim their work­force after ex­haust­ing other av­enues.”</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat had on Mon­day an­nounced that avi­a­tion and aero­space com­pa­nies will re­ceive 50 per cent wage sup­port for the first $4,600 of monthly pay for each lo­cal em­ployee, for seven more months.</p>
    <p>An ad­di­tional $187 mil­lion will be pumped into Sin­ga­pore’s hard-hit avi­a­tion sec­tor – which in­cludes air­lines, ground han­dlers, cargo agents and air­port ten­ants.</p>
    <p>Mr Mus­dal­ifa Ab­dul­lah, chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer of ground han­dling com­pany dnata, said the fund­ing will help to slow its cash burn. But the com­pany will still have to save costs and “care­fully man­age our work­force needs in line with the re­duced vol­umes and ex­plore other av­enues of in­come”.</p>
    <p>He noted that dnata’s vol­umes have fallen by around 95 per cent from the lev­els be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“There is no short-term so­lu­tion; we are pre­par­ing for a long-haul re­cov­ery where the ini­tial fo­cus is firmly on sus­tain­abil­ity rather than prof­itabil­ity,” he added.</p>
    <p>An­other ground han­dling com­pany, Sats, said the sup­port will help it to pre­serve more jobs and ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Group – which com­prises SIA, SilkAir and bud­get car­rier Scoot – as well as Jet­star Asia wel­comed the mea­sures. But both noted that work is on­go­ing to man­age their costs, with most planes still grounded.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Air­bus said that it sup­ports the Govern­ment’s ef­forts in pro­tect­ing Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion as a re­gional hub for the aero­space in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies also said that they are adapt­ing their busi­nesses.</p>
