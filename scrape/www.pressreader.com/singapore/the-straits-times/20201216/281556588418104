    <p>Short-term busi­ness trav­ellers from all coun­tries will be able to stay, work and meet at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties here from the mid­dle of next month, with­out the need for prior quar­an­tine, as ef­forts get un­der way to draw them back. Those who opt to use the ar­range­ment will be trans­ported from the air­port to the fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The pri­vate home mar­ket re­sumed its up­ward march in Novem­ber, with sales up nearly 19 per cent com­pared with the pre­vi­ous month fol­low­ing a surge in the num­ber of new homes launched.</p>
    <p>Last month’s uptick in sales to 767 units from 645 in Oc­to­ber came fol­low­ing a tem­po­rary pull­back in Oc­to­ber’s sales af­ter the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity clamped down on the re-is­sue of op­tions to pur­chase. The mar­ket’s re­silience could well spill over into this month, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>The pri­vate re­sale mar­ket also con­tin­ued to re­cover, with flash fig­ures from real es­tate por­tal</p>
    <p>SRX Prop­erty show­ing that re­sale prices and trans­ac­tion vol­umes in­creased last month.</p>
    <p>The high­est trans­acted price last month was for a re­sale luxury apart­ment at Nas­sim Jade, which sold for $11.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) has set up lab­o­ra­to­ries with two lo­cal small and medium-sized en­ter­prises, to the tune of $11.5 mil­lion, to help these firms build new ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A*Star’s Ad­vanced Re­man­u­fac­tur­ing and Tech­nol­ogy Cen­tre (ARTC) will have a new joint lab with Tru-Marine, which spe­cialises in main­te­nance, re­pair and over­haul of tur­bocharg­ers.</p>
    <p>Their com­bined in­vest­ment will be $6 mil­lion over three years, and they will de­velop a new sys­tem to mon­i­tor the health of marine tur­bocharg­ers in real time. This al­lows pre­dic­tive main­te­nance and helps ship own­ers, man­agers or op­er­a­tors save costs and avoid un­planned down­time.</p>
    <p>Mr James Loke, group chief ex­ec­u­tive of Tru-Marine, said: “While we have the idea, it might take us a longer time to de­velop it be­cause of the (lim­ited) re­sources of an SME. With ARTC’s strong sup­port and do­main ex­per­tise on how data is be­ing trans­ferred, this will greatly help us re­duce the time­line of our prod­uct go­ing into the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>The firm will pilot the ser­vice on Pa­cific In­ter­na­tional Lines’ ships.</p>
    <p>Tru-Marine has hired a data an­a­lyst and a data sci­en­tist, and will re­cruit three or four more in sim­i­lar roles in the next few years.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, ARTC and Abra­sive Engi­neer­ing (AE) will in­vest a to­tal of $5.5 mil­lion over three years in a joint lab that will help AE build ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties and en­ter new in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>In the pipe­line are higher pre­ci­sion valves for more in­dus­tries, in­clud­ing ad­di­tive man­u­fac­tur­ing and fast-mov­ing con­sumer goods, as well as a fully au­to­mated room for sand­blast­ing.</p>
    <p>The joint lab will cre­ate at least nine new jobs in pro­duc­tion and engi­neer­ing roles.</p>
    <p>It will also tap the ex­per­tise of sci­en­tists and en­gi­neers from two other A*Star units: the In­sti­tute of High Per­for­mance Com­put­ing and the Na­tional Metrol­ogy Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>A*Star yes­ter­day also launched its pilot In­no­va­tion Fac­tory @ SIMTech (Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Man­u­fac­tur­ing Tech­nol­ogy), in col­lab­o­ra­tion with En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore. At the 1,400 sq ft co-cre­ation space, A*Star sci­en­tists and en­gi­neers will guide com­pa­nies to de­sign and cre­ate new prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The fac­tory’s fa­cil­i­ties in­clude a work­shop with elec­tri­cal and me­chan­i­cal de­sign tools, and man­u­fac­tur­ing equip­ment like 3D print­ers.</p>
    <p>Once a com­pany is ready to scale up pro­duc­tion for a newly de­vel­oped prod­uct, it can move to the Model Fac­tory @ A*Star to make it.</p>
    <p>A full-scale ver­sion of the in­no­va­tion fac­tory is ex­pected to open next year at the CleanTech Park in the Jurong In­no­va­tion District, span­ning 5,000 sq ft to 6,000 sq ft.</p>
    <p>Four­teen lo­cal SMEs and two trade as­so­ci­a­tions have joined the pilot fac­tory as mem­bers and strate­gic part­ners, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Tan See Leng, who was at the launch of the joint labs and in­no­va­tion fac­tory, said he was “very happy to know that our lo­cal SMEs are not stand­ing still and wait­ing for the (pan­demic) to blow over”.</p>
    <p>“I en­cour­age other SMEs to also de­velop new busi­ness lines and strengthen their ex­ist­ing ones, to in­crease rev­enue, profits and strengthen their com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages.”</p>
