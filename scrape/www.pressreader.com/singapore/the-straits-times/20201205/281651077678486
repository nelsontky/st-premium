    <p>Sin­ga­pore will have four dig­i­tal banks, with dig­i­tal full bank li­cences go­ing to the Grab-Singtel con­sor­tium and tech gi­ant Sea.</p>
    <p>The Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore also granted dig­i­tal whole­sale bank li­cences to Mr Jack Ma’s Ant Group as well as a con­sor­tium com­pris­ing Green­land Fi­nan­cial Hold­ings, Lin­kl­o­gis Hong Kong and Beijing Co-op­er­a­tive Eq­uity In­vest­ment Fund Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>This means that for the first time here, non-banks will be al­lowed to pro­vide bank­ing ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The ea­gerly awaited an­nounce­ment, ex­pected in June, was de­layed af­ter the as­sess­ment pe­riod for the award was ex­tended due to Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Q What is a dig­i­tal full bank?</p>
    <p>A A dig­i­tal full bank can serve both re­tail and cor­po­rate cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Like any tra­di­tional bank, it can pro­vide or­di­nary Sin­ga­pore­ans with bank­ing ser­vices such as the open­ing of ac­counts, giv­ing loans, is­su­ing debit and credit cards and of­fer­ing in­vest­ment prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>But all bank­ing ser­vices will be car­ried out on­line, with the dig­i­tal bank not hav­ing a phys­i­cal branch or ATMs. This is dif­fer­ent from tra­di­tional banks putting some bank­ing ser­vices on­line via the In­ter­net or mo­bile apps.</p>
    <p>Q What is a dig­i­tal whole­sale bank? A Such a bank will serve non-re­tail cus­tomers only, such as small and medium-sized en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>Q How were the win­ners cho­sen?</p>
    <p>A A to­tal of 21 ap­pli­ca­tions were sub­mit­ted for the li­cences, and 14 were short­listed.</p>
    <p>The bid­ders in­cluded e-com­merce com­pa­nies, tech­nol­ogy and telco firms, and fin­techs such as crowd­fund­ing plat­forms and pay­ment ser­vices providers.</p>
    <p>The win­ners were judged on the fol­low­ing cri­te­ria: • their value propo­si­tion and busi­ness model</p>
    <p>• the sus­tain­abil­ity of their dig­i­tal bank­ing busi­ness</p>
    <p>• their in­no­va­tive use of tech­nol­ogy</p>
    <p>• growth prospects and other con­tri­bu­tions to Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial cen­tre</p>
    <p>Q How will Sin­ga­pore­ans ben­e­fit from dig­i­tal banks?</p>
    <p>A With less over­heads, branch­less dig­i­tal banks may of­fer higher in­ter­est rates on de­posits. Lower fees for fi­nan­cial prod­ucts are likely as there will be no mid­dle­man used.</p>
    <p>The lower costs of dig­i­tal banks may en­able them to bet­ter reach un­der­served groups in Sin­ga­pore such as en­trepreneur­s and mi­cro en­ter­prises. These banks may of­fer to open de­posit ac­counts with no min­i­mum amount, for ex­am­ple, or adopt a dif­fer­ent credit risk as­sess­ment ap­proach.</p>
    <p>There will be more con­ve­nience for cus­tomers, with all bank­ing ser­vices at their fin­ger­tips 24/7.</p>
    <p>There will be more per­son­alised ser­vices – for ex­am­ple, with prod­uct rec­om­men­da­tions – with the use of tech­nol­ogy to gather and mine data.</p>
    <p>There will also be more in­no­va­tive ser­vices due to more com­pe­ti­tion, with bank­ing opened up to non-bank play­ers.</p>
    <p>A dig­i­tal full bank can serve both re­tail and cor­po­rate cus­tomers. Like any tra­di­tional bank, it can pro­vide or­di­nary Sin­ga­pore­ans with bank­ing ser­vices such as the open­ing of ac­counts, giv­ing loans, is­su­ing debit and credit cards and of­fer­ing in­vest­ment prod­ucts. But all bank­ing ser­vices will be car­ried out on­line, with the dig­i­tal bank not hav­ing a phys­i­cal branch or ATMs.</p>
    <p>Q Any down­sides?</p>
    <p>A Pos­si­ble draw­backs in­clude: • tech­nol­ogy and ser­vice in­ter­rup­tions</p>
    <p>• se­cu­rity and iden­tity theft con­cerns • lack of a per­sonal banker re­la­tion­ship</p>
    <p>Q Do other economies have dig­i­tal banks?</p>
    <p>A They are not new. Here are some ex­am­ples around the world:</p>
    <p>• Alibaba’s MYbank and Ten­cent’s WeBank in China</p>
    <p>• SBI Su­mishin Net Bank in Ja­pan</p>
    <p>• Kakao Bank in South Korea</p>
    <p>• Neat in Hong Kong</p>
    <p>• Timo in Viet­nam</p>
    <p>• Up Bank in Aus­tralia</p>
    <p>• Star­ling Bank in the United</p>
    <p>King­dom</p>
    <p>• Chime in the United States</p>
    <p>• Do­con­omy in Swe­den Ann Wil­liams</p>
