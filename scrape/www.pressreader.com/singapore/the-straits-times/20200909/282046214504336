    <p>Browse so­fas, ta­bles and l amps while hop­ping be­tween var­i­ous fur­ni­ture shops and see how they look like in a liv­ing room set­ting, with­out leav­ing home.</p>
    <p>This is what The Fur­ni­ture Cen­trum of­fers shop­pers – a vir­tual mall with fur­ni­ture recre­ated to scale in 3D graph­ics not un­like those in a video game. Shop­pers can then click on fur­ni­ture they would like to buy from the re­tail­ers’ web­sites.</p>
    <p>The vir­tual mall houses show­rooms for 28 lo­cal fur­ni­ture brands and is part of this year’s Great Sin­ga­pore Sale (GSS), which is be­ing held in a largely vir­tual for­mat for the first time since it started 26 years ago.</p>
    <p>The event comes amid a re­tail slump due to the pan­demic. Re­tail sales, ex­clud­ing motor ve­hi­cles, fell 7.7 per cent year on year in July. How­ever, they rose 19.5 per cent from June on a sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis as Covid-19 re­stric­tions eased.</p>
    <p>This year’s eGSS: Shop. Win. Ex­pe­ri­ence event is or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Re­tail­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (SRA) with the Sin­ga­pore Fur­ni­ture In­dus­tries Coun­cil, the Tex­tile and Fash­ion Fed­er­a­tion and, for the first time, the As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore At­trac­tions. Mall oper­a­tor Frasers Prop­erty Re­tail is the eGSS’ part­ner and will sup­port the sale’s cam­paign ini­tia­tives across 15 malls, while Sing­tel is the event’s telco part­ner.</p>
    <p>SRA, which ini­tially out­lined the event in July, re­leased more de­tails yes­ter­day about the sale. The event takes place from to­day un­til Oct 10 on the GoSpree.sg plat­form.</p>
    <p>Re­tail ex­perts told The Straits Times that the eGSS might give lo­cal play­ers a boost amid the down­turn.</p>
    <p>Dr Se­shan Ra­maswami, as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of mar­ket­ing ed­u­ca­tion at Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity, said that be­yond go­ing on­line, the ac­tive col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween a mall oper­a­tor and trade as­so­ci­a­tions is “par­tic­u­larly sig­nif­i­cant”. “Th­ese are all (from) in­dus­tries that are par­tic­u­larly hit by the Covid-19 (re­stric­tions) – and the at­tempt by them to boost sales in this pe­riod will hope­fully re­pair some of the dam­age over the last sev­eral months.”</p>
    <p>Asked about the vir­tual fur­ni­ture show­room, Dr Ra­maswami called it an “in­no­va­tive ex­per­i­ment”. “It re­mains to be seen if con­sumers can get used to buy­ing ma­jor ad­di­tions to their homes in a vir­tual store. A lot de­pends on how ef­fec­tive the (vir­tual mall’s) pre­sen­ta­tion is.”</p>
    <p>Dr Lewis Lim, as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of mar­ket­ing prac­tice at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s Nanyang Busi­ness School, said the dig­i­tal for­mat “en­cour­ages re­tail­ers to think in­no­va­tively on how they can cre­ate an in­ter­est­ing shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ence for their cus­tomers”.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts said more can be done to make the event more ap­peal­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Amos Tan, a se­nior lec­turer at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic’s School of Busi­ness, said GoSpree “needs to spend a lot of top dol­lars... to in­crease aware­ness of the plat­form’s ex­is­tence” as many may think of sites like Lazada and Shopee first.</p>
    <p>GoSpree’s in­ter­face can be im­proved too as shop­pers have many lay­ers to go through be­fore they can get to items they want, he added.</p>
    <p>Coupons can be down­loaded on the GoSpree site to be used for on­line or phys­i­cal in-store pur­chases.</p>
    <p>GoSpree will host Face­book live streams ev­ery Wed­nes­day, where per­son­al­i­ties, such as ac­tress Mu­nah Bagharib and model-host Jade Seah, will pro­mote prod­ucts and places of at­trac­tion. An eCat­a­logue, pub­lished ev­ery Thurs­day, will high­light deals for the week. GoSpree also has daily dis­counts.</p>
    <p>Nearly 400 home-grown and global brands will of­fer over 2,000 deals on the GoSpree plat­form, in an ef­fort to drive do­mes­tic spend­ing.</p>
