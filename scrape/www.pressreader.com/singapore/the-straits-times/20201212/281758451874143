    <p>HONG KONG Hong Kong democ­racy ac­tivist and me­dia ty­coon Jimmy Lai, 73, has been charged un­der the city’s na­tional se­cu­rity law on sus­pi­cion of col­lud­ing with for­eign forces, his Ap­ple Daily news­pa­per re­ported yes­ter­day, cit­ing a po­lice source.</p>
    <p>Lai, an ar­dent critic of Bei­jing, is the high­est-pro­file per­son charged un­der the sweep­ing new law im­posed on the Chi­nese-ruled city in June. He was due to ap­pear in court to­day, ac­cord­ing to Ap­ple Daily, a pop­u­lar tabloid known for its feisty and crit­i­cal cov­er­age of China and Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity law, which pun­ishes what Bei­jing broadly de­fines as se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces with up to life in jail, has been con­demned by the West and hu­man rights groups as a tool to crush dis­sent in the semi-au­ton­o­mous city.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in Hong Kong and Bei­jing say it is vi­tal to plug gap­ing holes in na­tional se­cu­rity de­fences ex­posed by months of some­times vi­o­lent anti-gov­ern­ment and anti-China protests that rocked the city over the last year.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong po­lice did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a request for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The pub­lish­ing ty­coon is one of the fi­nan­cial hub’s most prom­i­nent democ­racy ac­tivists, while his Next Me­dia group is con­sid­ered one of the key re­main­ing bas­tions of me­dia free­doms in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have intensifie­d a crackdown on op­po­si­tion forces in the city, dis­miss­ing law­mak­ers from the leg­is­la­ture, con­duct­ing wide­spread ar­rests and jail­ing high-pro­file democ­racy ac­tivists, in­clud­ing Joshua Wong.</p>
    <p>Lai had been a fre­quent visi­tor to Wash­ing­ton, where he met of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo, to rally sup­port for Hong Kong democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, a 19-year-old was yes­ter­day found guilty of in­sult­ing China’s na­tional flag and of un­law­ful as­sem­bly.</p>
    <p>Tony Chung, who led the nowdis­banded pro-democ­racy group Stu­dent Lo­cal­ism, was con­victed of throw­ing the Chi­nese flag to the ground out­side Hong Kong’s leg­is­la­ture in May last year.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent hap­pened dur­ing scuf­fles be­tween ri­val sup­port­ers as pro-democ­racy law­mak­ers in­side the leg­is­la­ture tried to pre­vent the pass­ing of a now-aban­doned ex­tra­di­tion Bill.</p>
    <p>“The ac­tions of the de­fen­dant were out of ques­tion de­fil­ing the na­tional flag in an open man­ner. The de­fen­dant walked back and jumped to throw the flag which made more peo­ple able to see what he did,” Mag­is­trate Peony Wong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Chung was ar­rested by plain­clothes po­lice of­fi­cers op­po­site the United States con­sulate in late Oc­to­ber and had been re­manded in cus­tody since.</p>
    <p>He did not plead guilty to the flag in­sult or un­law­ful as­sem­bly, which carry max­i­mum jail terms of three and five years re­spec­tively. He will be sen­tenced on Dec 29.</p>
    <p>Chung is also the first per­son to be pros­e­cuted un­der the new na­tional se­cu­rity law. He faces a charge of se­ces­sion un­der the law, which could land him a life sen­tence, as well as sep­a­rate charges of money laun­der­ing and con­spir­ing to pub­lish sedi­tious con­tent.</p>
    <p>Chung’s next court hear­ing on the na­tional se­cu­rity charge is on Jan 7 next year.</p>
