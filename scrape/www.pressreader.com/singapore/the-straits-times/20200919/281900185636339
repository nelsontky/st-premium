    <p>OT­TAWA • A driver who al­legedly set his car to au­topi­lot and then took a nap as it broke the speed limit on a ru­ral Cana­dian high­way has been charged with dan­ger­ous driv­ing, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent took place near the town of Ponoka in Al­berta prov­ince, the lo­cal force said in a tweet on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“The car ap­peared to be self­driv­ing, trav­el­ling over 140kmh with both front seats com­pletely re­clined and oc­cu­pants ap­peared to be asleep,” it said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Cana­dian public broad­caster CBC, the car was an elec­tric Tesla model set to au­topi­lot and the man charged was 20 years old.</p>
    <p>The speed limit on that sec­tion of the high­way is 110kmh, it added.</p>
    <p>Po­lice Sergeant Dar­rin Turn­bull told CBC t hat he was “speech­less” and had not seen such a case in his two-decade ca­reer – “but, of course, the tech­nol­ogy wasn’t there”.</p>
    <p>“No­body was look­ing out the wind­shield to see where the car was go­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Tesla’s au­topi­lot mode al­lows cars to steer, ac­cel­er­ate and brake au­to­mat­i­cally within a lane, but is not sup­posed to en­able trips with­out hu­man in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>The United States com­pany warns on its web­site that “cur­rent au­topi­lot fea­tures re­quire ac­tive driver su­per­vi­sion and do not make the ve­hi­cle au­ton­o­mous”.</p>
    <p>But the pres­i­dent of a Cana­dian Tesla own­ers’ club, who con­demned the in­ci­dent, told CBC that there were videos cir­cu­lat­ing on­line with in­struc­tions on how to “hack” the cars’ safety sys­tems.</p>
