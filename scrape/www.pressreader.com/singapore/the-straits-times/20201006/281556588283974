    <p>1 Tas­ma­nian devils re­turn</p>
    <p>Tas­ma­nian devils – clas­si­fied as en­dan­gered – have been re­leased into the wild on Aus­tralia’s main­land, more than 3,000 years af­ter they died out there. Aussie Ark and a coali­tion of other con­ser­va­tion groups re­vealed yes­ter­day that they had re­leased 26 of the car­niv­o­rous mam­mals into a 400ha sanc­tu­ary at Bar­ring­ton Tops Na­tional Park in New</p>
    <p>South Wales.</p>
    <p>SYD­NEY • Tas­ma­nian devils have been re­leased into the wild on Aus­tralia’s main­land in what con­ser­va­tion­ists de­scribed as a “his­toric” step, 3,000 years af­ter the feisty mar­su­pi­als went ex­tinct there.</p>
    <p>Aussie Ark, along with a coali­tion of other con­ser­va­tion groups, re­vealed yes­ter­day that they had re­leased 26 of the car­niv­o­rous mam­mals into a 400ha sanc­tu­ary at Bar­ring­ton Tops, about 31 / hours</p>
    <p>2 north of Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>Mr Tim Faulkner, pres­i­dent of Aussie Ark, said the “his­toric” re­leases in July and last month were the first steps in a project akin to the suc­cess­ful move to re­turn wolves to Yel­low­stone Na­tional Park in the United States in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 16 years of work, in­clud­ing the es­tab­lish­ment of main­land Aus­tralia’s largest Tas­ma­nian devil breed­ing pro­gramme, Mr Faulkner said it was “in­cred­i­ble and sur­real” to have reached the goal.</p>
    <p>“It’s the stuff dreams are made of,” he told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>“Our big­gest na­tive main­land preda­tor is the tiger quoll – and they’re just over a kilo – so to be bring­ing back some­thing of this enor­mity is huge.”</p>
    <p>Tas­ma­nian devils, which weigh up to 8kg and have a black or brown coat, typ­i­cally prey on other na­tive an­i­mals or scavenge car­casses.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the gov­ern­ment en­vi­ron­men­tal au­thor­i­ties, devils are not dan­ger­ous to hu­mans or live­stock but will de­fend them­selves if at­tacked and can cause se­ri­ous in­jury.</p>
    <p>The an­i­mals – known for their ex­tremely loud growl, pow­er­ful jaws and fe­roc­ity when con­fronting ri­vals over food or mates – are clas­si­fied as en­dan­gered af­ter a con­ta­gious fa­cial tu­mour dis­ease rav­aged the re­main­ing pop­u­la­tion on the Aus­tralian is­land state of Tas­ma­nia.</p>
    <p>It is es­ti­mated that fewer than 25,000 Tas­ma­nian devils still live in the wild, down from as many as 150,000 be­fore the mys­te­ri­ous, fa­tal dis­ease first struck in the mid-1990s.</p>
    <p>On Aus­tralia’s main­land, they are be­lieved to have been wiped out by packs of din­goes – wild dogs na­tive to the vast con­ti­nent – an es­ti­mated 3,000 years ago.</p>
    <p>Mr Faulkner said it was hoped the breed­ing project would cre­ate an “in­sur­ance pop­u­la­tion” against the dis­ease, which has so far proved un­treat­able, and help re­store the na­tive en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“Devils present one of the only nat­u­ral so­lu­tions to the con­trol of the fox and cat, and the fox and cat are re­spon­si­ble for nearly all of our 40 mam­mal ex­tinc­tions,” he added.</p>
    <p>“So there’s more than the devil at stake here.”</p>
    <p>Aussie Ark se­lected the rein­tro­duced devils for their breed­ing suitabilit­y, plac­ing them in a sprawl­ing, fenced area in the hopes of ward­ing off threats to their sur­vival in­clud­ing feral pests, nox­ious weeds and ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>“We’ve put young, healthy devils in, we put them in now which gives them the best part of six months to set­tle, find their ter­ri­tory (and) pre­pare for breed­ing,” which usu­ally oc­curs in Fe­bru­ary, Mr Faulkner said.</p>
    <p>An­other 40 are set to be re­leased over the next two years into the sanc­tu­ary, which is on land bought by Aussie Ark for its habi­tat suitabilit­y, high num­ber of her­bi­vores and lo­ca­tion near a na­tional park.</p>
    <p>“The land ini­tially was se­lected be­cause it’s just like a slice of Tas­ma­nia,” Mr Faulkner said.</p>
    <p>He said he was con­fi­dent that close mon­i­tor­ing as the Tas­ma­nian devils make the “mas­sive tran­si­tion” back to the wild – where they have no sup­plied food, wa­ter or shel­ter for the first time in their lives – would en­sure the pro­gramme’s early suc­cess.</p>
    <p>The Tas­ma­nian devil is one of seven cor­ner­stone species crit­i­cal to Aus­tralia’s ecosys­tem that Aussie Ark plans to rein­tro­duce to the wild sanc­tu­ary in the com­ing years, along with quolls, bandi­coots and rock wal­la­bies.</p>
