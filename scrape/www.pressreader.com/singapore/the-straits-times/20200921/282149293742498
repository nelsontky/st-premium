    <p>Us­ing mul­ti­ple ac­counts with fic­ti­tious names on food de­liv­ery ap­pli­ca­tions, a 27-year-old man or­dered food us­ing his neigh­bours’ ad­dresses and in­structed de­liv­ery riders to leave the meals there.</p>
    <p>He also promised the riders that he would pay them af­ter the de­liv­ery but never did so.</p>
    <p>Leonard Tan Tong Han was sen­tenced to seven days’ jail last Thurs­day af­ter plead­ing guilty to four charges of cheat­ing. Each charge was for a sep­a­rate in­ci­dent in­volv­ing a dif­fer­ent de­liv­ery rider.</p>
    <p>Nine other sim­i­lar charges, in­volv­ing other de­liv­ery riders, were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing by Prin­ci­pal District Judge Toh Han Li.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that Tan or­dered more than $700 worth of food us­ing mul­ti­ple ac­counts on the mo­bile apps of food de­liv­ery op­er­a­tors GrabFood and Food­panda.</p>
    <p>He used fic­ti­tious names and ran­dom phone num­bers to set up the ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Feb 25 and March 14, he or­dered food to be de­liv­ered to ei­ther of two neigh­bours’ flats. He also opted to pay for the or­ders in cash upon de­liv­ery of the food.</p>
    <p>Each time be­fore the food ar­rived, Tan in­structed the de­liv­ery rider to leave the meal out­side the unit.</p>
    <p>He also said he would pay the de­liv­ery rider for the food through elec­tronic pay­ment apps PayLah! or PayNow.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the de­liv­ery rider fol­lowed his in­struc­tions and left, Tan then picked up the food but did not make pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that on two oc­ca­sions, af­ter fail­ing to re­ceive pay­ment from Tan, the de­liv­ery rider re­turned to the unit the food was de­liv­ered to.</p>
    <p>Both times, the neigh­bour at the flat in­formed the rider that he had not or­dered any food. The rider then made a po­lice report.</p>
    <p>One of the neigh­bours also made a po­lice report af­ter one in­stance on Feb 25, say­ing that his ad­dress could have been mis­used.</p>
    <p>It is not stated how Tan was even­tu­ally caught.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that GrabFood and Food­panda lost $718.54 in to­tal due to Tan’s of­fences.</p>
    <p>Tan has since made full resti­tu­tion to both firms.</p>
    <p>He will be­gin serv­ing his sen­tence on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>For each of­fence of cheat­ing, Tan could have been jailed for up to three years and/or fined.</p>
