    <p>In two sep­a­rate cases, 28 people will be charged in court with flout­ing safe dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions by hold­ing and at­tend­ing social gath­er­ings, said the po­lice in state­ments yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The first group at­tended a house party dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, when social gath­er­ings were dis­al­lowed. The sec­ond group met at a pub­lic fit­ness corner and drank al­co­hol there dur­ing phase two.</p>
    <p>For the first gath­er­ing, 18 people – com­pris­ing 17 Sin­ga­pore­ans and a per­ma­nent res­i­dent aged 19 to 37 – will be charged in court be­tween to­day and Fri­day over of­fences dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>On May 8, a cou­ple liv­ing in Com­pass­vale Crescent in Sengkang in­vited eight men and eight women to their home for a social gath­er­ing, said the po­lice.</p>
    <p>The 16 guests who visited the cou­ple’s home be­tween 9.30pm on May 8 and 1am on May 9 will be charged with vi­o­lat­ing re­stric­tions by leav­ing their place of res­i­dence with­out a valid rea­son.</p>
    <p>The host­ing cou­ple will be charged with vi­o­lat­ing re­stric­tions on per­mit­ting other in­di­vid­u­als to enter their place of res­i­dence with­out a valid rea­son.</p>
    <p>All 18 people will also be charged with vi­o­lat­ing the pro­hi­bi­tion on social gath­er­ings un­der Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond group of 10, com­pris­ing five men and five women, all Sin­ga­pore­ans aged be­tween 19 and 33, will be charged in court to­day over of­fences com­mit­ted dur­ing phase two of Singapore’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>At around 12.50am on June 28, the po­lice re­ceived a com­plaint over noise pol­lu­tion at Block 42 Beo Crescent, in Tiong Bahru.</p>
    <p>When they ar­rived, 13 people were gath­ered at a fit­ness corner near the block, said the po­lice. Portable ta­bles and chairs had been set up and bot­tles of liquor were found.</p>
    <p>Ten from the group will be charged with vi­o­lat­ing re­stric­tions on leav­ing their place of res­i­dence with­out a valid rea­son and vi­o­lat­ing the pro­hi­bi­tion on social gath­er­ings of more than five people un­der Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>They will also be charged with con­sum­ing liquor at a pub­lic place dur­ing the no-pub­lic drinking pe­riod, which lasts from 10.30pm to 7am daily.</p>
    <p>As for the three re­main­ing in­di­vid­u­als, the po­lice – in con­sul­ta­tion with the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers – have given a 12-month con­di­tional warn­ing to a 14-year-old boy for vi­o­lat­ing re­stric­tions on leav­ing his place of res­i­dence with­out a valid rea­son and for vi­o­lat­ing the pro­hi­bi­tion on social gath­er­ings un­der Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Two oth­ers from the group will be dealt with sep­a­rately for breach­ing Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions, as they are cur­rently also be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for other un­re­lated of­fences.</p>
    <p>The po­lice warned that they will not hes­i­tate to take ac­tion against any­one who does not com­ply with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures or shows bla­tant dis­re­gard for the law.</p>
    <p>Singapore’s cir­cuit breaker pe­riod be­gan on April 7 and lasted un­til June 1. Phase one started on June 2, when some busi­nesses were al­lowed to re­open with safety mea­sures in place, and grad­u­at­ing co­horts of stu­dents started to re­turn to school.</p>
    <p>How­ever, social gath­er­ings of up to five people per group were per­mit­ted only when phase two started on June 19.</p>
