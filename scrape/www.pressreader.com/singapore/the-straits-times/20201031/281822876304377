    <p>BRUS­SELS • The Euro­pean Union’s health­care sys­tems are in dan­ger of be­ing over­whelmed by the num­ber of coro­n­avirus cases un­less the au­thor­i­ties act quickly, the head of the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion Ur­sula von der Leyen told a news con­fer­ence on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“The spread of the virus will over­whelm our health­care sys­tems if we do not act ur­gently,” she said af­ter a video con­fer­ence of EU lead­ers to co­or­di­nate the re­sponse to the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic raced ahead across the con­ti­nent, Europe has moved back to be­ing an epi­cen­tre of the global on­slaught, fac­ing the prospect of a pro­longed eco­nomic slump along­side a pub­lic health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The world­wide tally rose by more than 500,000 for the first time on Wed­nes­day, a record one­day in­crease as coun­tries across the north­ern hemi­sphere re­ported daily spikes.</p>
    <p>Daily cases glob­ally have grown by nearly 25 per cent in un­der two weeks as the world wit­nessed 400,000 daily re­ported cases for the first time on Fri­day last week.</p>
    <p>Most Western coun­tries and parts of Latin Amer­ica have posted their high­est sin­gle-day surges in the past few weeks.</p>
    <p>Many gov­ern­ments, with the no­table ex­cep­tion of the United States, have started tak­ing stronger mea­sures in a bid to bring the spread of the virus un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>The global tally stands at 44.7 mil­lion cases and about 1.17 mil­lion deaths.</p>
    <p>Europe, North Amer­ica and Latin Amer­ica ac­count for over 66 per cent of world­wide cases and more than 76 per cent of global deaths.</p>
    <p>Europe’s new daily in­fec­tions have dou­bled over the past two weeks as it re­ported more than 250,000 cases for the first time on Wed­nes­day, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>The re­gion has so far re­ported about 9.5 mil­lion cases and about 261,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>France logged a new record daily to­tal of more than 50,000 in­fec­tions for the first time on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond wave of the pan­demic has forced many coun­tries across Europe to reim­pose re­stric­tions to con­tain the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>The US con­tin­ues to lead the world­wide tally – with over nine mil­lion in­fec­tions and more than 227,000 fa­tal­i­ties since the pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>It is see­ing out­breaks in vir­tu­ally ev­ery part of the coun­try shortly be­fore its pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is re­port­ing about 75,000 cases a day on av­er­age, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>The US’ death toll from Covid-19 could sur­pass 500,000 by Fe­bru­ary next year un­less nearly all Amer­i­cans wear face masks, re­searchers said.</p>
    <p>Asia sur­passed 10 mil­lion in­fec­tions on Satur­day last week, the sec­ond-heav­i­est re­gional toll in the world, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally, as cases con­tinue to mount in In­dia de­spite a slow­down and sharp de­clines else­where.</p>
    <p>In­dia, the world’s sec­ond most­pop­u­lous coun­try as well as the sec­ond worst-af­fected coun­try, is re­port­ing about 48,000 cases a day on av­er­age, with a to­tal of about eight mil­lion cases, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>As In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi promised to pro­vide any suc­cess­ful vac­cine to each of In­dia’s 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple, the coun­try is pre­par­ing a data­base of all govern­ment and pri­vate health per­son­nel to speed up vac­ci­na­tions once they be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>In the Mid­dle East, Iran, which is the most af­fected coun­try, is re­port­ing one death ev­ery three min­utes, ac­cord­ing to state tele­vi­sion.</p>
