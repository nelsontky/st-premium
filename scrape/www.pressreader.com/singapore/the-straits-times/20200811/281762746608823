    <p>GENEVA • A se­vere house­hold wa­ter short­age fac­ing two out of five peo­ple glob­ally is un­der­min­ing ef­forts to con­tain the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fre­quent and thor­ough hand wash­ing is among the most ef­fec­tive mea­sures in re­strict­ing the virus’ spread be­cause the pri­mary routes of trans­mis­sion are droplets and di­rect con­tact, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Yet, some three bil­lion peo­ple do not have ac­cess to run­ning wa­ter and soap at home, and four bil­lion suf­fer from se­vere wa­ter scarcity for at least one month a year, the United Na­tions group UN-Wa­ter said. “It is a dis­as­trous sit­u­a­tion for peo­ple liv­ing without ac­cess to safe wa­ter and safely man­aged san­i­ta­tion,” UN-Wa­ter chair­man Gil­bert Houngbo said in an in­ter­view. “The chronic un­der­in­vest­ment has left bil­lions vul­ner­a­ble, and we are now see­ing the con­se­quences.”</p>
    <p>Years of de­ferred in­vest­ments in clean wa­ter and san­i­ta­tion are now putting ev­ery­one at risk as the virus spreads through de­vel­oped and de­vel­op­ing na­tions, gen­er­at­ing a cy­cle of in­fec­tion and re-in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The world needs to spend US$6.7 tril­lion (S$9.2 tril­lion) on wa­ter in­fra­struc­ture by 2030, ac­cord­ing to the UN, not just for the ur­gent san­i­ta­tion needs, but also to tackle longer-term is­sues from the pan­demic such as pro­vid­ing bet­ter ir­ri­ga­tion to head off a po­ten­tial food cri­sis, said Mr Houngbo.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies have stepped in to of­fer so­lu­tions for the most ur­gent prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Lixil Group, which owns brands such as Amer­i­can Stan­dard and Grohe, worked with Unicef and other part­ners to cre­ate an off-grid hand-wash­ing gad­get that needs only a small amount of wa­ter in a bot­tle.</p>
    <p>For US$1 mil­lion, it will make 500,000 units in In­dia to be do­nated to serve 2.5 mil­lion peo­ple be­fore it starts re­tail sales.</p>
    <p>It is a rapid, short-term re­sponse to help fight the pan­demic, but more sus­tain­able in­vest­ments are needed, such as in­stalling piped wa­ter to more homes, said Ms Clarissa Brock­le­hurst, fac­ulty mem­ber of the Wa­ter In­sti­tute at the Univer­sity of North Carolina and a former wa­ter, san­i­ta­tion and hy­giene chief at Unicef.</p>
    <p>The lack of ac­cess to ba­sic wa­ter and san­i­ta­tion is one more ex­am­ple of the lethal ef­fects of in­equal­ity be­ing ex­posed by the pan­demic. The im­pacts of wa­ter mis­man­age­ment are felt dis­pro­por­tion­ately by the poor, who are more likely to rely on rain-fed agri­cul­ture for food and are most at risk from con­tam­i­nated wa­ter and in­ad­e­quate san­i­ta­tion, the World Bank said.</p>
    <p>Un­der­priv­i­leged peo­ple in cities are par­tic­u­larly vul­ner­a­ble as they of­ten live in densely pop­u­lated ar­eas where so­cial dis­tanc­ing is hard, es­pe­cially if they have to share a wa­ter source.</p>
    <p>As many as 5.7 bil­lion peo­ple could be liv­ing in ar­eas where wa­ter is scarce for at least one month a year by 2050, cre­at­ing un­prece­dented com­pe­ti­tion for wa­ter, said the UN’s Mr Houngbo.</p>
    <p>By one es­ti­mate, each de­gree of global warm­ing will ex­pose about 7 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion to a de­crease of re­new­able wa­ter re­sources of at least 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Hand wash­ing for so long has been what I would call in­fan­tilised,” Ms Brock­le­hurst said. “All of a sud­den, it is a mat­ter of life and death, and adults are teach­ing them­selves hand-wash­ing songs.”</p>
