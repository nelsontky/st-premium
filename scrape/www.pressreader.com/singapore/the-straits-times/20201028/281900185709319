    <p>MARTINS­BURG • With eight days to go un­til the Nov 3 elec­tion, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump ad­dressed bois­ter­ous ral­lies in Pennsylvan­ia on Mon­day, while Demo­crat Joe Bi­den made a low-key ap­pear­ance in the state con­sid­ered cru­cial to the chances of vic­tory for both men.</p>
    <p>“We win Pennsylvan­ia, we win the whole ball­game,” Mr Trump told a rally in Martins­burg, his third and fi­nal event of the day, as he pre­dicted a win in the state de­spite trail­ing Mr Bi­den in most opin­ion polls.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den made a small-scale ap­pear­ance in the city of Chester, near Philadel­phia, meet­ing about a dozen cam­paign vol­un­teers and speak­ing with re­porters.</p>
    <p>He said he was “not over­con­fi­dent about any­thing” and “with the grace of God”, he would win Pennsylvan­ia, the state where he was born.</p>
    <p>“I think we’re go­ing to win Michi­gan, I think we’re go­ing to win Wis­con­sin. I think we’re go­ing to win Min­nesota.</p>
    <p>“I think we have a fight­ing chance in Ohio. I think we have a fight­ing chance in North Carolina. We have a fight­ing chance in Ge­or­gia,” Mr Bi­den added, re­fer­ring to other elec­tion bat­tle­ground states.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den also stepped up his crit­i­cism of Mr Trump’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic that has killed more than 225,000 peo­ple in the United States, say­ing: “The bot­tom line is, Don­ald Trump is the worst pos­si­ble pres­i­dent, the worst pos­si­ble per­son to lead us through this pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Surg­ing coro­n­avirus cases i n many parts of the coun­try have dom­i­nated the cam­paign, along with news of a Covid-19 out­break among Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence’s staff.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence, who cam­paigned in Min­nesota, tested neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus on Mon­day, his of­fice said, af­ter multiple se­nior aides tested pos­i­tive over the week­end.</p>
    <p>In a case over Wis­con­sin’s elec­tion pro­ce­dures, the US Supreme Court on Mon­day re­jected on a 5-3 vote an ef­fort by Democrats to al­low of­fi­cials in the state to count mail-in bal­lots post­marked on elec­tion day – Nov 3 – that ar­rive up to six days later.</p>
    <p>The ac­tion by the apex court’s con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity keeps i n place a state pol­icy that mail-in bal­lots must be in the hands of Wis­con­sin elec­tion of­fi­cials by the close of the polls.</p>
    <p>Re­turn­ing to the White House from Pennsylvan­ia, Mr Trump tweeted: “Big prob­lems and dis­crep­an­cies with Mail In Bal­lots all over the USA. Must have fi­nal to­tal on Novem­ber 3rd.”</p>
    <p>Twit­ter flagged the tweet with a disclaimer de­scrib­ing the post’s con­tent as “dis­puted” and po­ten­tially mis­lead­ing.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say, how­ever, it may take days or even weeks to process the huge num­ber of mail-in bal­lots, spurred by vot­ers seek­ing to avoid crowded polling sta­tions be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Some 42.7 mil­lion Amer­i­cans have al­ready voted by mail, part of the more than 63.6 mil­lion who have cast bal­lots ahead of the elec­tion, a record-break­ing pace that could lead to the high­est US voter turnout by per­cent­age in more than a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>De­spite Mr Bi­den’s solid lead in na­tional opin­ion polls, the con­test ap­pears tighter in the most crit­i­cal bat­tle­ground states that could de­cide the out­come.</p>
    <p>A Reuters/Ipsos poll con­ducted from Oct 20 to Oct 26 gave Mr Bi­den a nar­row ad­van­tage over Mr Trump in Pennsylvan­ia.</p>
    <p>A state where a ma­jor­ity of vot­ers can swing to­wards ei­ther ma­jor party, Pennsylvan­ia has been heav­ily courted with fre­quent vis­its by both can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump went from Allentown to Li­titz and then fi­nally to Martins­burg, all towns out­side the large sub­ur­ban hubs where the race may be de­cided.</p>
    <p>He also planned multiple stops in Michi­gan and Wis­con­sin this week, as well as vis­its to Ari­zona, Ne­braska and Ne­vada.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump told re­porters he ex­pected to win Pennsylvan­ia by a larger mar­gin than the 0.72 per cent vic­tory he achieved in de­feat­ing Demo­crat Hil­lary Clin­ton in 2016.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing sup­port­ers, Mr Trump touched on what he called an “ex­is­ten­tial” is­sue for Pennsylvan­ia – Mr Bi­den’s com­ment dur­ing last week’s pres­i­den­tial de­bate that, if elected, he would “tran­si­tion” the US away from oil and nat­u­ral gas.</p>
    <p>“He wants to go with wind­mills that are made in Ger­many and China,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>He added: “Bi­den’s plan is an eco­nomic death sen­tence for Pennsylvan­ia’s en­ergy sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>In Chester, Mr Bi­den de­fended his stance, say­ing: “I’m not shut­ting down oil­fields.</p>
    <p>“I’m not elim­i­nat­ing frack­ing. I’m in­vest­ing in clean en­ergy.”</p>
