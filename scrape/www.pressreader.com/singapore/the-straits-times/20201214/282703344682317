    <p>Pre-school grad­u­a­tions usu­ally in­volve elab­o­rate per­for­mances of some kind, but at ChildFirst Pre-school this year, K2 stu­dents took part in a “400m sprint”, shot put, sumo wrestling and bas­ket­ball – with ro­bots.</p>
    <p>Its novel Robo Olympics in Oc­to­ber, held at its three cen­tres with live up­dates via Zoom, en­cap­su­lates the ethos of the 10-year-old brand. It be­lieves in rais­ing “trilin­gual” kids who are as flu­ent in English and Man­darin as they are in cod­ing.</p>
    <p>Cod­ing en­rich­ment classes are not un­com­mon in pre-schools, but ChildFirst has a ded­i­cated com­puter teacher who holds lessons last­ing about an hour twice a week, while class­room teach­ers are en­cour­aged to weave tech­nol­ogy into other lessons as well.</p>
    <p>Its stu­dents are ex­posed to ro­bots from the age of four with­out the use of screens. In­stead, they learn cod­ing prin­ci­ples by “pro­gram­ming” them­selves as “ro­bots”, fol­low­ing in­struc­tions on cards to move for­ward or turn, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>The pre-school also uses screen-free ro­bots for younger kids and in­tro­duces tablets and a com­mer­cially avail­able Dash ro­bot at the kinder­garten level. It charges $1,655 a month for full-day child care.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing The Straits Times’ visit to its Mount­bat­ten cen­tre, six-year-olds showed off their cod­ing knowl­edge by pro­gram­ming ro­bot “elves” to wrap presents, play “bas­ket­ball” and dance in sync.</p>
    <p>While it all looks fun and im­pres­sive to the ca­sual ob­server, the ed­u­ca­tional take­aways are man­i­fold as chil­dren are ex­posed to the fun­da­men­tals of com­pu­ta­tional think­ing from a young age, says Dr Richard Yen, founder of Ed­no­va­tion, the pre-school’s par­ent com­pany and a Har­vard-ed­u­cated sci­en­tist by train­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­yond us­ing sim­ple al­go­rithms to tell the ro­bots what to do, kids learn to break up a long piece of code into smaller blocks (called de­com­po­si­tion), look for pat­terns so they do not have to re­write se­quences of code (pat­tern recog­ni­tion), and fil­ter out unim­por­tant de­tails (ab­strac­tion).</p>
    <p>“Cod­ing is only one part of what they learn. Com­pu­ta­tional think­ing is to train them to be able to solve prob­lems in a sys­tem­atic way,” Dr Yen says, proudly shar­ing that stu­dents from ChildFirst won the preschool cat­e­gory of the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Cod­ing Ro­bot­ics Com­pe­ti­tion last year.</p>
    <p>While the pre-school fu­ture-proofs its young charges by help­ing them mas­ter ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, it also be­lieves in build­ing skills that AI can­not re­place. The cen­tre fol­lows a mul­ti­ple in­tel­li­gences ap­proach that boosts chil­dren’s po­ten­tial be­yond just tra­di­tional IQ.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing their cod­ing lessons for the ro­bot dance, for in­stance, chil­dren also learn about team­work, and bounc­ing back from fail­ure and cre­ativ­ity, Dr Yen says.</p>
    <p>“These are im­por­tant skills in the fu­ture.”</p>
