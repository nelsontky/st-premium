    <p>The coupe ver­sion of BMW’s 3-se­ries has long been the choice of en­thu­si­asts who yearn to have that ex­tra ounce of verve and ex­cite­ment at the wheel.</p>
    <p>But, in re­cent years, that propo­si­tion has weak­ened some­what – partly be­cause the four-door is quite a pol­ished per­former in its own right. And partly be­cause the two-door – since it was re­named the 4-se­ries – does not of­fer ap­pre­cia­bly more than what you ex­pect of a coupe, ow­ing largely to the same driv­e­train that is shared by a large num­ber of models.</p>
    <p>The spec­i­fi­ca­tions speak for them­selves. The 420i Coupe tested here shares the same en­gine and trans­mis­sion as the 320i.</p>
    <p>A purring 1,998cc four-cylin­der turbo makes 184hp and 300Nm of torque. Via an eight-speed au­to­box, the out­put is sent to the rear wheels with creamy smooth­ness.</p>
    <p>But the 420i, be­ing slightly heav­ier, clocks a 7.5-se­cond cen­tury sprint, while its four-door twin does it in 7.1 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>The weight penalty also trans­lates to a 0.1-litre in­crease in fuel con­sump­tion to 6.4 litres/100km, al­though the real-life fig­ure for this drive is closer to 11 litres/100km.</p>
    <p>The two-door’s top speed, how­ever, is 5kmh higher at 240kmh, per­haps be­cause of bet­ter aero­dy­nam­ics – the car is lower slung.</p>
    <p>As for han­dling – usu­ally the piece de re­sis­tance of a coupe – the 420i’s su­pe­ri­or­ity is not im­me­di­ately ob­vi­ous. The car is longer and wider than the 3, but is not as tall. Its wheel­base is iden­ti­cal at 2,851mm, but its tracks are strangely nar­rower – not a great recipe for dy­namism.</p>
    <p>The coupe sits on a firmly sprung sus­pen­sion, which gives it a slightly jig­gly ride, but al­lows it to hold up to hard cor­ner­ing quite well.</p>
    <p>So, un­less you are in­clined to do a lot of hard cor­ner­ing, the 420i would be bet­ter served by non-M Sport springs. Or you could pay a bit more for an adap­tive sus­pen­sion sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Still, the 4 comes across as some­what more com­fort­able than the 330i M Sport, which had a pun­ish­ing ride. This is to the 4’s credit, es­pe­cially since it is slightly heftier and stiffer.</p>
    <p>In­side, you will find a fa­mil­iar cock­pit, with noth­ing sub­stan­tial to dif­fer­en­ti­ate it from the sedan ex­cept for its sports seats. Be­hind the wheel, the en­gine note is sup­pos­edly more ap­par­ent, but is not. You get the same smooth ren­di­tion you hear in the sedan, but noth­ing to tell you that you are in a sportier car.</p>
    <p>So, is there a point to own­ing a car like the new 4?</p>
    <p>Yes, j ust as peo­ple find sport util­ity ve­hi­cles ir­re­sistible, even if most of them will never go of­froad.</p>
    <p>Yes, just as the wealth­ier lot buy su­per­cars, even if many of them never take their rides to the track.</p>
    <p>The main point is that the 4 is a beau­ti­ful car. Vis­ually, its grace­ful pro­por­tions clearly stand out and the car looks like a big­ger and, more im­por­tantly, bet­ter styled ver­sion of the 2-se­ries.</p>
    <p>It wears a bold new grille, which is jar­ring at first but quickly grows on you. Too bad this is slightly marred by the num­ber plate (op­tional in some mar­kets).</p>
    <p>The 4 is also rather pain­less as a fam­ily car, with easy ac­cess to a spa­cious se­cond row.</p>
    <p>And, like the new 3s, it comes with a new key­less sys­tem which un­locks the doors as you ap­proach the car and locks them when you walk away. It also comes with Re­vers­ing As­sis­tant, which re­traces the car’s path for up to 50m.</p>
    <p>So, while the 420i may not ex­actly be hot, it is def­i­nitely cool.</p>
