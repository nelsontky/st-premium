    <p>He may be 59, but Mr Ra­joo Ravin­dran has no plans to re­tire just yet.</p>
    <p>In­stead, this month, he will be start­ing a new job as a trainee at a law firm.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of two was among 11 stu­dents who grad­u­ated on Tues­day from the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences’ (SUSS) Juris Doc­tor (JD) law pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The grad­u­ates, pi­o­neers of a pro­gramme for stu­dents who al­ready have de­grees, have all se­cured prac­tice train­ing con­tracts with law firms.</p>
    <p>On av­er­age, they at­tained a cu­mu­la­tive grade point av­er­age of 3.81 out of five.</p>
    <p>SUSS’ law school, Sin­ga­pore’s third and new­est, was set up in 2016 to ad­dress a short­age of lawyers in crim­i­nal and fam­ily law in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­joo, the old­est in his class – where the av­er­age age of stu­dents is 40 – has been dreaming of join­ing the pro­fes­sion for a long time.</p>
    <p>He be­came a po­lice of­fi­cer in 1978, af­ter com­plet­ing his O lev­els.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­joo rose through the ranks, spend­ing 29 years in the Po­lice In­tel­li­gence Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>He re­tired in Fe­bru­ary as a trainer in the depart­ment, hold­ing the rank of as­sis­tant su­per­in­ten­dent.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been in­volved in solv­ing many ma­jor crimes... I al­ways en­joyed the process of work­ing with peo­ple – com­plainants, wit­nesses, sus­pects and ac­cused per­sons – to un­cover the truth,” said Mr Ra­joo.</p>
    <p>He said he re­ceived greater sat­is­fac­tion when an ac­cused per­son changed for the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“Some even vis­ited me at the po­lice sta­tion af­ter hav­ing served their sen­tences in prison, to ex­press their grat­i­tude.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­joo would usu­ally set aside time to talk to them and of­fer them ad­vice, hop­ing that they would not re-of­fend.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion starts from the po­lice sta­tion, not in prison,” he said.</p>
    <p>With en­cour­age­ment from a friend who prac­tises crim­i­nal law, Mr Ra­joo took up a part-time law de­gree in 2002 with the Univer­sity of Lon­don, of­fered by the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Com­merce.</p>
    <p>He com­pleted the pro­gramme, but con­tin­ued serv­ing in the po­lice force to re­ceive his full pen­sion.</p>
    <p>Still, he held on to his dream of be­com­ing a lawyer, and when SUSS set up the law pro­gramme, he im­me­di­ately ap­plied.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t easy work­ing and study­ing part-time. It took three traits – com­mit­ment, dis­ci­pline and be­ing will­ing to make sac­ri­fices,” said Mr Ra­joo, who com­pleted his de­gree with sec­ond-class hon­ours.</p>
    <p>The JD pro­gramme for those who al­ready have a first de­gree can be com­pleted within four to six years, while the Bach­e­lor of Laws pro­gramme for those with­out de­grees can take 4 1/2 to six years.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­joo had classes i n the evenings twice a week, with week­ends set aside for as­sign­ments.</p>
    <p>Last year, he missed out on a se­mes­ter of classes as he had to re­cover from ma­jor knee surgery.</p>
    <p>“I went through record­ings of lec­tures, and I had very good class­mates who shared notes with me so I could do my as­sign­ments at home,” he said.</p>
    <p>His daugh­ter, 29, and son, 34, also got mar­ried in the past three years.</p>
    <p>“I had to do what I had to do as a fa­ther and still bal­ance work and study­ing. If you want some­thing, you have to go for it and get it done.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­joo will start work as a trainee at Peter Ong Law Cor­po­ra­tion to­mor­row, a firm well known for its ex­per­tise in crim­i­nal law.</p>
    <p>“My mind was al­ready set. Law isn’t some­thing I wanted to­day or even yes­ter­day, but some­thing I have wanted for a very long time.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t want to miss out on this op­por­tu­nity,” he said.</p>
    <p>“My aim is to learn as much as pos­si­ble from se­nior lawyers and gain new skills and knowl­edge. I want to serve the peo­ple and com­mu­nity at large.”</p>
    <p>In a speech to mark the com­ple­tion of the pro­gramme, Ms In­dra­nee Ra­jah, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice, said the ob­jec­tives set out for the third law school have be­gun to bear fruit through the first batch of grad­u­ates.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the grad­u­ates, Ms In­dra­nee, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance and Na­tional Devel­op­ment, added: “You also serve a much higher calling. As spe­cial­ists in crim­i­nal and fam­ily law, you will reg­u­larly be called upon to be the voice of those who need help.</p>
    <p>“I en­cour­age each one of you to not only be good pro­fes­sion­als, but also to be lawyers of the high­est in­tegrity and com­pas­sion.”</p>
