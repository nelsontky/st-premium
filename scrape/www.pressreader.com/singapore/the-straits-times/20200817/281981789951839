    <p>Of­fice man­ager Joyce Poh and her com­puter seemed trapped in an end­less game of hop­scotch when she was work­ing from home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Ms Poh never left the flat but she and her work sta­tion were of­ten on the move, as she jug­gled the de­mands of fam­ily and job com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>The merry-go-round be­gan in the morn­ing when she would start work­ing in the bed­room.</p>
    <p>Then it was over to the din­ing ta­ble, while her 21/ 2- year-old twin daugh­ters took their af­ter­noon naps, and fi­nally back to the bed­room when they woke up.</p>
    <p>Ms Poh, an em­ployee of cre­ative agency DDB Group Sin­ga­pore, joked that she of­ten felt like an “un­li­censed hawker mov­ing around”.</p>
    <p>“It’s just like how peo­ple used to go to ran­dom spots to set up their stalls. I had to move when­ever the kids came after me.”</p>
    <p>Ms Poh, 41, said daugh­ters Belinda and Amanda “couldn’t un­der­stand why I was home but un­able to play with them, so I would try to stay in a sep­a­rate room or I would never get any work done”.</p>
    <p>“My mum lives with us so she helps to watch the kids.”</p>
    <p>Ms Poh has been work­ing from home since the cir­cuit breaker be­gan in April. Hus­band David Lee, 46, is a pri­vate-hire driver.</p>
    <p>Now that the coun­try is in phase two and her chil­dren are back in pre-school, Ms Poh tends to stay put in the liv­ing area through­out the work day. There are no plans to set up a sep­a­rate ded­i­cated work area.</p>
    <p>“Any­where with a power out­let is fine. Also, there’s no space,” she said of her four-room Hous­ing Board flat.</p>
    <p>With no clear bound­aries be­tween work and her per­sonal life – both phys­i­cally and men­tally – she con­fessed that it oc­ca­sion­ally felt “claus­tro­pho­bic” at home.</p>
    <p>“I love that the fam­ily can spend more time to­gether, but I make it a habit to take the girls out for evening walks. They need to go out­side and breathe too,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Poh also has to find time to run er­rands. Her 71-year-old mum used to do it, but now stays home to avoid get­ting sick.</p>
    <p>One good thing about be­ing in charge of su­per­mar­ket runs is that Ms Poh can buy what­ever she wants. “My mum is quite healthy, but I find my­self grab­bing so many snacks – ice cream, es­pe­cially. Dur­ing this time, we should do what makes us happy, right?” she said, with a laugh.</p>
