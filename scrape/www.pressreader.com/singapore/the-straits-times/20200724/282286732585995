    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion (SSA) will hold its first vir­tual an­nual gen­eral meet­ing (AGM) and elec­tion of of­fice bear­ers for the next two years on Aug 20 amid the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that SSA pres­i­dent Lee Kok Choy will run for a fourth, and fi­nal, twoyear term.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment re­leased yes­ter­day, SSA sec­re­tary-gen­eral Bervyn Lee said: “In the light of the</p>
    <p>Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures and the 60-day ex­ten­sion given by the Registry of So­ci­eties (ROS) for us to hold our AGM, we en­gaged our stake­hold­ers and ex­plored dif­fer­ent op­tions be­fore fi­nally de­cid­ing on hold­ing a vir­tual AGM.</p>
    <p>“Since this is also an elec­tion year, we have built in ad­di­tional buf­fers into the time­line. This will give our af­fil­i­ates suf­fi­cient time to un­der­stand the process and en­sure that it runs smoothly and trans­par­ently.</p>
    <p>“We will also be hold­ing vir­tual town halls to brief ev­ery­one and pro­vide clar­i­fi­ca­tions. We want our mem­bers to ex­er­cise their con­sti­tu­tional right and stay safe at the same time.</p>
    <p>“We are thank­ful to all our af­fil­i­ates who have been very sup­port­ive and un­der­stand­ing dur­ing this pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>With a re­stric­tion on large-scale gath­er­ings in place ow­ing to the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the SSA’s 100 af­fil­i­ates, which in­clude 37 vot­ing mem­bers, can at­tend the AGM only via Zoom video con­fer­ence and not in per­son.</p>
    <p>The SSA also ex­plained that as its con­sti­tu­tion does not pro­vide for elec­tronic vot­ing for gen­eral meet­ings, each mem­ber may vote only by ap­point­ing the chair­man of the meet­ing as the proxy to vote at the meet­ing, as in­structed by the ROS.</p>
    <p>Nom­i­na­tions close on Aug 5, 7pm and all votes are to be sub­mit­ted by Aug 18, 7pm by e-mail.</p>
    <p>As the chair­man of the meet­ing is the as­so­ci­a­tion’s chief him­self, the SSA will ap­point an in­de­pen­dent per­son to di­rect and su­per­vise the count­ing of votes cast through proxy at the AGM, and main­tain records of proxy forms sub­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>In­stead of a writ­ten no­tice of 14 days, as re­quired in the SSA con­sti­tu­tion, pro­vi­sions have been made for a longer no­tice pe­riod so that the mem­bers have more time to un­der­stand the pro­cesses re­quired of a vir­tual AGM.</p>
    <p>They will also re­ceive an in­fo­graphic that out­lines the time­line and pro­cesses, while two vir­tual town halls will be held next Mon­day and on Aug 10 to ad­dress any queries.</p>
    <p>Trial runs for the vir­tual ses­sions will be con­ducted to en­sure that el­i­gi­ble mem­bers will be able to log in.</p>
    <p>Ace Swim Club’s Lim Lee Eng said: “We un­der­stand the dif­fi­cul­ties caused by the Covid-19 re­stric­tions and are fully sup­port­ive of SSA’s de­ci­sion to hold a vir­tual AGM.</p>
    <p>“The longer no­tice pe­riod and the in­fo­graphic have been very use­ful.</p>
    <p>“We are happy that SSA has been proac­tively en­gag­ing us to ex­plain the vot­ing process to en­sure that the elec­tion is con­ducted in a fair and trans­par­ent man­ner.”</p>
