    <p>Once upon a time, Chil­dren’s Day was a joy­ous cel­e­bra­tion of child­hood in Sin­ga­pore, a day to trea­sure the in­no­cence and ex­u­ber­ance of little ones.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren’s Day on Fri­day, though, marks eight months of one of the tough­est and strangest years for kids. They have had to grow up sud­denly in the shadow of the pan­demic, of­ten with par­ents who were as scared and con­fused as they were.</p>
    <p>“I felt kind of trapped in a cage be­cause we were just locked in this house for 12, 13 hours a day, and we could go out­side only for a short time,” re­calls Yaash Kir­palani, 11, of the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Over the months, how­ever, tantrums trans­formed into habit as kids learnt to wear masks ev­ery day, trep­i­da­tion over home-based learning (HBL) woes evolved into baby steps to­wards in­de­pen­dent learning, and mis­ery over so­cial iso­la­tion changed to ac­cep­tance as they found new ways to con­nect.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times looks at how the Covid-19 cri­sis has shaped child­hood in Sin­ga­pore so far this year.</p>
    <p>1 THE PAN­DEMIC AF­FECTED KIDS PHYS­I­CALLY...</p>
    <p>“Any ma­jor dis­as­ter or un­for­tu­nate event may have trau­matic ef­fects on chil­dren,” says Dr Chan Poh Chong, head and se­nior con­sul­tant in the di­vi­sion of gen­eral am­bu­la­tory pae­di­atrics and ado­les­cent medicine at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH).</p>
    <p>Some bounce back sooner than oth­ers, he says, but health ex­perts re­port a va­ri­ety of ail­ments fol­low­ing the pan­demic’s ex­treme dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Mo­hana Ra­jaku­len­dran, a con­sul­tant pae­di­a­tri­cian at Park­way East Pae­di­atric Clinic, no­ticed stranger anx­i­ety among some tod­dlers who had lim­ited so­cial in­ter­ac­tion dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Other tots had speech de­lays as busy par­ents re­sorted to dig­i­tal babysit­ters while work­ing from home, and a “large num­ber of chil­dren” had con­sti­pa­tion be­cause of their seden­tary rou­tines and changes in diet dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>More chil­dren with al­ler­gic rhini­tis and asthma ex­pe­ri­enced flare­ups be­cause they were con­fined to home en­vi­ron­ments with a high con­cen­tra­tion of dust mites, she adds.</p>
    <p>Dr Chan also points out that tod­dlers may also face de­vel­op­men­tal chal­lenges as masks on other peo­ple hin­der their abil­ity to read fa­cial ex­pres­sions to learn about so­cial re­ac­tions. They now have to use the tone of voice and body lan­guage as cues in­stead.</p>
    <p>Par­ents can help by spend­ing one-on-one time with their tots so they do not lag be­hind de­vel­op­men­tally, Dr Mo­hana sug­gests. En­gage in ac­tiv­i­ties that pro­mote speech and so­cial de­vel­op­ment, such as read­ing to­gether, chat­ting about their day, and talk­ing about feel­ings and emo­tions.</p>
    <p>2 ... AND EMO­TION­ALLY</p>
    <p>“We see i ncreased anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion in chil­dren post-cir­cuit breaker,” says Dr Ce­line Wong a con­sul­tant in the de­part­ment of psy­cho­log­i­cal medicine at the NUH.</p>
    <p>Her de­part­ment recorded an in­crease of about 12 per cent in new out­pa­tient vis­its among kids aged seven to 18 from May to Au­gust, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Youth psy­chi­atric ad­mis­sions of teens aged 13 to 18 rose 2 1/2 times for the same com­par­a­tive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Kids re­ported be­ing de­pressed be­cause they were iso­lated from their peer groups and strug­gling with HBL, Dr Wong says.</p>
    <p>They also had fewer out­lets for phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity, which helps man­age stress.</p>
    <p>“Iso­la­tion and lone­li­ness among youth have been as­so­ci­ated with de­creased well-be­ing and poorer men­tal health.</p>
    <p>“Lone­li­ness has also been as­so­ci­ated with in­creased self-harm, eat­ing dis­or­der risk be­hav­iours, as well as sui­ci­dal thoughts,” Dr Wong ex­plains.</p>
    <p>Some chil­dren ex­pe­ri­enced “se­vere anx­i­ety” when they had to re­turn to school and keep up with aca­demic ex­pec­ta­tions de­spite the ed­u­ca­tional dis­rup­tions, with some re­fus­ing to go to school, she adds.</p>
    <p>As pro­longed stress and anx­i­ety can l ead to clin­i­cal de­pres­sion, par­ents should make sure their kids main­tain their usual rou­tines and ac­tiv­i­ties as much as pos­si­ble, to­gether with reg­u­lar sleep, good eat­ing habits and ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>She ad­vo­cates “ju­di­cious use” of gad­gets and so­cial me­dia for teens as “youth need peer con­nec­tions as well as healthy adult con­nec­tions to stay men­tally healthy”.</p>
    <p>With no end date in sight for Covid-19, par­ents play a crit­i­cal role as cham­pi­ons of their chil­dren’s well-be­ing in the months to come.</p>
    <p>Kids need a safe space at home to share their chal­lenges with­out judg­ment, says Ms Skye Tan, a fam­ily life spe­cial­ist with Fo­cus on the Fam­ily.</p>
    <p>3 SCREEN TIME BE­CAME A BLESS­ING AND A CURSE</p>
    <p>In many coun­tries, ex­perts are con­cerned about mil­lions of school­go­ing chil­dren who will miss key ed­u­ca­tional mile­stones be­cause of ex­tended school clo­sures and multi-faceted prob­lems with HBL. A BBC re­port in June even pon­dered if they would be a “lost gen­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has fared much bet­ter in com­par­i­son, thanks to a gen­er­ally suc­cess­ful HBL tran­si­tion dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and schools re­open­ing after a three-month break.</p>
    <p>Whether par­ents like it or not, chil­dren here have learnt to be tech­no­log­i­cally savvy to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>Be­yond just a medium for learning, screen time has evolved into a way for kids to con­nect with their friends and fam­ily while stay­ing safe, says Dr G. Kaveri, a lec­turer in early child­hood education at the S R Nathan School of Hu­man De­vel­op­ment in the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences.</p>
    <p>While this is nec­es­sary at the moment, she worries about the im­pact of in­creased screen time on the al­ready high rate of my­opia here.</p>
    <p>Par­ents like Mrs Pamela Kir­palani, 39, an in­ter­per­sonal com­mu­ni­ca­tions coach and au­thor, have had to weigh con­cerns about ad­dic­tion with the so­cial ben­e­fits of screen time.</p>
    <p>She dis­cov­ered that her son, Yaash, and his class­mates used the pop­u­lar game Fort­nite as a so­cial­is­ing and bond­ing plat­form.</p>
    <p>“It be­came a bit of a di­chotomy for us,” she says. “We knew that was their way to con­nect, and we didn’t want them to stop con­nect­ing.</p>
    <p>“There was a lot of team­work go­ing on in these games as well. Yaash at one point was teach­ing peo­ple how to strate­gise.”</p>
    <p>4 SOME NEEDED HELP TO KEEP UP</p>
    <p>The pan­demic re­in­forced sobering so­cial re­al­i­ties as well. Many chil­dren from dis­ad­van­taged back­grounds found it harder to adapt to HBL, even though the Min­istry of Education and pri­vate groups stepped in to help with tech and other forms of sup­port.</p>
    <p>That is be­cause kids need “a con­ducive home en­vi­ron­ment that in­cludes re­sources such as In­ter­net ac­cess, phys­i­cal space, a com­puter and a mature adult to fa­cil­i­tate chil­dren’s learning”, Dr Kaveri ex­plains.</p>
    <p>“These may not be read­ily avail­able for chil­dren from dis­ad­van­taged back­grounds, thus hav­ing im­pli­ca­tions for their learning and de­vel­op­ment.”</p>
    <p>It has also led to worries that such “in­equal­i­ties will be en­trenched”, says so­ci­ol­o­gist Paulin Straughan, dean of stu­dents at the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity. She hopes schools will “pay more at­ten­tion to these chil­dren and help them catch up”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she does see a silver lin­ing in the sit­u­a­tion. “As in­equal­i­ties are ren­dered vis­i­ble, our chil­dren will also see the marginalis­ed groups in our com­mu­nity and, I hope, grow com­pas­sion for these vul­ner­a­ble groups. They will also see how well we cope as a com­mu­nity and the value of an in­te­grated so­ci­ety with strong ties.”</p>
    <p>5 KIDS GREW CLOSER TO THEIR PAR­ENTS</p>
    <p>De­spite the calamity it sowed, the pan­demic be­stowed the gift of time, which is a “very pow­er­ful in­vest­ment in build­ing strong re­la­tion­ships”, says Ms Tan of Fo­cus on the Fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The char­ity’s re­cent sur­vey of 1,052 chil­dren aged 10 to 15 bears this out, with more than seven in 10 kids say­ing they were close to their par­ents. As par­ents had to play an ac­tive role in HBL, they also grew to un­der­stand their chil­dren’s strengths and learning needs, which will strengthen fam­ily ties as well, Ms Tan adds.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, sec­ondary school teacher Sury­ati Mail, 40, is thank­ful for the “good qual­ity time” she and her hus­band spent with their two chil­dren, aged six and nine, dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker. The fam­ily started a gar­den­ing hobby on their bal­cony and baked Hari Raya good­ies to­gether.</p>
    <p>“We re­ally ap­pre­ci­ate that time, even though it was dif­fi­cult,” she says.</p>
    <p>6 THEY LEARNT TO BE RE­SILIENT</p>
    <p>Ms Sury­ati mar­vels at how her young kids have adapted to a largely stay-home life even now, with sub­dued birth­day par­ties at home and oc­ca­sional out­ings to lo­cal at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>Prof Straughan reck­ons that de­spite the fis­sures, “this gen­er­a­tion of chil­dren will emerge stronger from the pan­demic” be­cause the coun­try has man­aged com­mu­nity spread well so far.</p>
    <p>Dr Chan adds: “The good thing about most chil­dren is that they are more re­silient than we think, and the ma­jor­ity will be able to bounce back to their new nor­mal ac­tiv­i­ties and ad­just ac­cord­ingly with­out long-term con­se­quences.”</p>
