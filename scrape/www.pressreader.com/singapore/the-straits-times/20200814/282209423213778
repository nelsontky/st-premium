    <p>LONDON • FA Cup replays will be scrapped for next sea­son in a bid to ease the strain on clubs dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the English Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (FA) an­nounced yesterday.</p>
    <p>With a short­ened sea­son start­ing a month later than usual in Septem­ber, there is more pres­sure on an al­ready hec­tic cal­en­dar.</p>
    <p>So the FA has taken the de­ci­sion that all ties in the FA Cup will be de­cided on the day rather than al­low­ing for the usual re­play to ease fa­tigue con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“In or­der to as­sist in eas­ing pres­sure on the foot­ball sched­ule, there will be no replays for the 2020-21 sea­son,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“After two sea­sons of record lev­els of prize funds, the Emi­rates FA Cup prize fund has re­turned back in line with 2017-18 lev­els due to the fi­nan­cial im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cant changes have also been made by the English Foot­ball League to the League Cup in a bid to help teams cope with the sched­ule.</p>
    <p>The first four rounds will be com­pressed into con­sec­u­tive weeks in Septem­ber, with the fifth round held the week be­fore Christ­mas to avoid clashes with the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>The two-legged semi-fi­nals, of­ten crit­i­cised by man­agers, will now be played on Jan 5 or 6, with the club drawn first ben­e­fit­ing from home ad­van­tage. Premier League clubs will en­ter the com­pe­ti­tion in ei­ther round two, or round three for sides with Euro­pean com­mit­ments.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has also prompted the top flight to can­cel its win­ter break next term, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by the BBC yesterday.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son was the first time it had been im­ple­mented, with each team hav­ing one week­end and one full mid­week off in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>It was in re­sponse to long­stand­ing calls to fol­low the ex­am­ple of other top Euro­pean leagues, whose cus­tom­ary break of be­tween two to three weeks has of­ten been cited as a rea­son be­hind their suc­cess in both the Cham­pi­ons League and Europa League.</p>
    <p>But with the up­com­ing cam­paign five weeks shorter than a usual sea­son, it has re­sulted in fix­ture con­ges­tion.</p>
    <p>The need to cram all three do­mes­tic com­pe­ti­tions on top of bal­anc­ing Euro­pean games meant that the break had to be sac­ri­ficed.</p>
    <p>The new term starts on Sept 12, com­pared to Aug 9 last year.</p>
