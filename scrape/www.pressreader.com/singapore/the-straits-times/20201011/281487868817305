    <p>At 6am, when Mrs Doris Tan and her hus­band rouse two of their three chil­dren from sleep to get ready for school, they are greeted by smoke that drifts into the mas­ter bed­room of their five-room Hous­ing Board flat in Hougang.</p>
    <p>The source – cig­a­rette smoke from the neigh­bour liv­ing in the unit di­rectly above them.</p>
    <p>“The whole room would be filled with smoke, which is re­ally bad be­cause we have an in­fant,” said Mrs Tan, 47, whose chil­dren are aged 15, 13 and nine months.</p>
    <p>Mrs Tan, who works in risk man­age­ment, said her hus­band has tried to dis­cuss the mat­ter am­i­ca­bly with the neigh­bour, but there has been no let-up in sec­ond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>So when news emerged of a pro­posal to ban smok­ing near win­dows and on bal­conies in homes, she was hope­ful of a so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng, who is chair­man of the Govern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, sug­gested the ban in an ad­journ­ment mo­tion in Par­lia­ment last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Amy Khor said the ban would not be pos­si­ble, cit­ing prac­ti­cal chal­lenges in en­force­ment that can ex­ac­er­bate ex­ist­ing con­cerns about pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed ban, though re­jected, was dis­cussed widely on­line.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tific ev­i­dence has shown that sec­ond-hand smoke can cause stroke, heart dis­ease and lung cancer in adults. It can also lead to mid­dle ear dis­ease, im­paired lung func­tion and sud­den in­fant death syn­drome in chil­dren.</p>
    <p>A 2018 re­port also said world­wide, sec­ond-hand smoke ac­counts for one in eight of all deaths at­trib­uted to to­bacco-re­lated dis­eases. In Sin­ga­pore, it is one in six.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-hand smoke has been a long­stand­ing is­sue. Dur­ing a 2018 par­lia­men­tary de­bate, some MPs said they got many com­plaints from res­i­dents about sec­ond-hand smoke waft­ing into their homes.</p>
    <p>Com­plaints about sec­ond-hand smoke in res­i­den­tial ar­eas have also re­cently risen, ex­ceed­ing 2,500 re­ports a month for May and June, from less than 2,000 be­fore, ac­cord­ing to the Mu­nic­i­pal Ser­vices Of­fice. This was likely due to more peo­ple work­ing from home dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, the of­fice said.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) had said in 2018 that when deal­ing with com­plaints, its of­fi­cers will ad­vise res­i­dents who smoke to not do so at the win­dows, bal­cony or doors.</p>
    <p>In pri­vate es­tates such as condominiu­ms, NEA in­forms the re­spec­tive man­age­ment cor­po­ra­tions so they can act on the com­plaint.</p>
    <p>If the is­sue per­sists, af­fected res­i­dents will be re­ferred to the Com­mu­nity Me­di­a­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ng said then that given the lack of a leg­isla­tive lever, not much can be done to help res­i­dents af­fected by the smoke – go­ing for com­mu­nity me­di­a­tion, which is op­tional, does not al­ways work.</p>
    <p>The Sun­day Times spoke to more than 10 smok­ers and non-smok­ers in to­tal to un­der­stand their points of view on the lat­est ban pro­posal.</p>
    <p>For some non-smok­ers, it is a mat­ter of health, cit­ing asthma as an ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers said they have young chil­dren or el­derly folk at home.</p>
    <p>Madam Phe­lia Yeo, 56, said it is not fair for non-smok­ers to have to en­dure sec­ond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>The real es­tate agent has been forced to shut the win­dows of her con­do­minium unit and keep the fan run­ning, as her neigh­bour smokes.</p>
    <p>This means she misses out on fresh air de­spite liv­ing in Bukit Timah op­po­site forested ar­eas around the Sin­ga­pore Quarry and rail cor­ri­dor.</p>
    <p>Mr Ted Ng, a hu­man re­sources ex­ec­u­tive who lives in a four-room HDB flat in Bukit Gom­bak, said he had com­plained to his neigh­bours about sec­ond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>But they in­sisted they were just hav­ing a quick smoke.</p>
    <p>“If we try to talk too much to them, they will get ag­gres­sive, so bet­ter not,” said Mr Ng, 36.</p>
    <p>Smok­ing is not al­lowed in com­mon ar­eas in res­i­den­tial premises – such as lift lob­bies and cor­ri­dors – parks, pub­lic trans­port, sports sta­di­ums and hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Those caught can be fined $200 or up to $1,000 if con­victed in court.</p>
    <p>But many smok­ers said a ban on smok­ing near win­dows and on bal­conies would be an in­tru­sion of pri­vacy and that a per­son’s home is pri­vate prop­erty. How­ever, they ac­knowl­edged that smok­ers can be more con­sid­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Mr Alif Haikal, 31, a food de­liv­ery rider who smokes, said he does so in a des­ig­nated room at home, away from win­dows that are shut.</p>
    <p>“There are chil­dren liv­ing in my area, I un­der­stand it can re­ally af­fect them, so I smoke in my own room and try to be con­sid­er­ate about it,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Ryan Matthew, 23, a first-year univer­sity stu­dent who smokes, agreed that smok­ers have to be con­sid­er­ate. “It’s about com­mu­ni­ca­tion and just talk­ing to your neigh­bours about it and be­ing con­sid­er­ate. We don’t want a cul­ture where ev­ery­one is afraid of step­ping on each other’s toes ei­ther,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Frank Young, 56, a re­tiree who used to work in ad­ver­tis­ing, ques­tioned the like­li­hood of en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>“We al­ready see prob­lems with en­forc­ing other rules, such as shared cor­ri­dors be­ing so clut­tered. These are fire haz­ards, yet it is so dif­fi­cult to get neigh­bours to clear it up,” said Mr Young, who does not smoke.</p>
    <p>In her re­sponse, Dr Khor had re­jected the idea of us­ing cam­eras to en­force the pro­posed ban.</p>
    <p>She said find­ing good van­tage points would be dif­fi­cult, or cam­eras would have to point di­rectly into homes, which is in­tru­sive.</p>
    <p>Mr Louis Ng told The Sun­day Times that cam­eras are cur­rently in use to catch high-rise lit­ter­bugs.</p>
    <p>“There are many ways to think and re­search about en­forc­ing this rule, and we will be try­ing to find more ways,” he said.</p>
    <p>Lawyers said us­ing cam­eras to mon­i­tor smok­ing in homes to en­force the ban could cre­ate prob­lems. Mr Bryan Tan, from le­gal firm Pin­sent Ma­sons MPil­lay, said there may be con­cerns that law en­force­ment, in mon­i­tor­ing peo­ple’s homes, may in­ad­ver­tently pick up other in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr K.K. Lim, from law firm Harry Elias Part­ner­ship, said “there is an in­stinc­tive so­cial and/or po­lit­i­cal ex­pec­ta­tion or limit on how far the law can go in reg­u­lat­ing a ci­ti­zen’s pri­vate ac­tiv­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>Ms Hong Jial­ing, 43, a sec­re­tary and non-smoker, cited the nosmok­ing zone in­tro­duced in Or­chard Road in re­cent years to ar­gue that most would abide by such a ban.</p>
    <p>“It has worked. So Sin­ga­pore­ans just need time to ad­just to fol­low the new rules,” she said.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers sug­gested smok­ing cab­ins be placed around neigh­bour­hoods, and for some form of penalty to be im­posed on those who do not turn up for me­di­a­tion when neigh­bours get into a dis­pute over sec­ond-hand smoke.</p>
    <p>There were also calls to ban cig­a­rettes al­to­gether. Mr Ng said: “The so­lu­tion has to be in the mid­dle, where it min­imises the im­pact of sec­ond-hand smoke and doesn’t elim­i­nate smok­ing al­to­gether.”</p>
    <p>He said that while he was dis­ap­pointed that the pro­posal was not ac­cepted by the Govern­ment, his team would “con­tinue to fight on”. He also plans to file more par­lia­men­tary ques­tions on the topic.</p>
    <p>“We will see the is­sues Dr Khor brought up and re­view that and study the best way for­ward,” said Mr Ng. “If you look at the so­cial me­dia ex­plo­sion af­ter (the ban was pro­posed), it is re­ally an is­sue that many peo­ple are af­fected by.”</p>
    <p>TO­BACCO PROD­UCTS WITH LESS SMOKE</p>
    <p>In the United States, the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion has ap­proved heated to­bacco prod­ucts as well as smoke­less to­bacco prod­ucts, which science showed are less harm­ful.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, health ex­perts have ar­gued for the use of e-cig­a­rettes to re­duce the prob­lem of sec­ond-hand smoke. These prod­ucts are cur­rently not al­lowed in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Dr Jeremy Lim, who has ex­pe­ri­ence in pub­lic health pol­icy, hav­ing worked pre­vi­ously with the Health Min­istry, said Sin­ga­pore can per­haps ex­plore such op­tions.</p>
    <p>“Con­sid­er­ing sec­ond-hand smoke is­sues, and how lit­tle per­sonal space Sin­ga­pore­ans have, tech­nol­ogy in­ter­ven­tions should at least be ex­plored in­stead of be­ing ca­su­ally dis­missed,” he added.</p>
    <p>“If the Brits and Amer­i­cans are do­ing these, we should ask our­selves if our poli­cies are the right ones,” said Dr Lim. “The pri­or­ity should be find­ing work­able so­lu­tions and not making moth­er­hood state­ments such as con­tin­u­ing to do more pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion.”</p>
    <p>If we try to talk too much to them, they will get ag­gres­sive, so bet­ter not.</p>
    <p>MR TED NG, who lives in a four-room HDB flat in Bukit Gom­bak and has neigh­bours who smoke.</p>
    <p>The so­lu­tion has to be in the mid­dle, where it min­imises the im­pact of sec­ond-hand smoke and doesn’t elim­i­nate smok­ing al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>NEE SOON GRC MP LOUIS NG</p>
    <p>AGovern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee (GPC) wants a ban on res­i­dents smok­ing near win­dows or on their bal­conies to min­imise the ef­fects of sec­ond-hand smoke on their neigh­bours. The prob­lem is not a small one. The last avail­able fig­ures, from 2016, showed that 383 peo­ple here died be­cause of sec­ond-hand smoke. Such smoke, whether waft­ing in from next door or en­coun­tered in pub­lic spa­ces, rep­re­sents a dou­ble me­nace for non-smok­ers: they are open to the threat of a dread­ful dis­ease even though they do not con­trib­ute to it by be­ing smok­ers them­selves. This is un­fair to them. It is not un­ex­pected then that the GPC sug­gested that laws be used to en­force a ban.</p>
    <p>In the first four months of this year, there were 11,400 smok­ing-re­lated com­plaints made to the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency, a 20 per cent jump over the same pe­riod last year. Much of that in­crease is thought to be due to peo­ple smok­ing in or near their homes. Work-from-home mea­sures since the Covid-19 out­break may have ex­ac­er­bated the prob­lem. Clearly, smok­ers should be aware of the ef­fect their habit has on those around them. Be­ing so­cially con­scious and neigh­bourly is a more prac­ti­cal ap­proach than hav­ing a law to en­force com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>There are is­sues of pri­vacy and the pos­si­ble in­fringe­ment of an owner’s right to pri­vate space. There are also prac­ti­cal chal­lenges of en­force­ment in­volved. Un­like sur­veil­lance of com­mon ar­eas and us­ing ther­mal cam­eras at smok­ing hot spots, how can the au­thor­i­ties mon­i­tor im­par­tially who is smok­ing in which part of the home? Of the 11,400 smok­ing com­plaints re­ceived in the first four months of this year, 58 per cent were in res­i­den­tial es­tates. Of these cases, 95 per cent re­lated to smok­ing in com­mon ar­eas. Just 5 per cent in­volved smok­ing in homes. Surely, com­mon sense, cour­tesy and a friendly chat re­main prefer­able to hav­ing the law step in.</p>
