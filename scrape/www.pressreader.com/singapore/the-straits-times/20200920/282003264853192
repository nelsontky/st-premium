    <p>WASH­ING­TON Sci­en­tists are pro­vid­ing a fuller un­der­stand­ing of the es­sen­tial role that sleep plays in brain health, iden­ti­fy­ing an abrupt tran­si­tion at about 2.4 years of age when its pri­mary pur­pose shifts from brain build­ing to main­te­nance and re­pair.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers on Fri­day said they con­ducted a sta­tis­ti­cal anal­y­sis on data from more than 60 sleep stud­ies. They looked at sleep time, du­ra­tion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, brain size and body size, and de­vised a math­e­mat­i­cal model for how sleep changes dur­ing de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>There are ba­si­cally two types of sleep, each tied to spe­cific brain waves and neu­ronal ac­tiv­ity. REM, with the eyes mov­ing quickly from side to side be­hind closed eye­lids, is deep sleep with vivid dreams. NonREM sleep is largely dream­less.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing REM sleep, the brain forms new neu­ral con­nec­tions by build­ing and strength­en­ing synapses – the junc­tions be­tween nerve cells, or neu­rons – that en­able them to com­mu­ni­cate, re­in­forc­ing learn­ing and con­sol­i­dat­ing mem­o­ries.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing sleep, the brain also re­pairs the mod­icum of daily neu­ro­log­i­cal dam­age it typ­i­cally experience­s to genes and pro­teins within neu­rons as well as clear­ing out byprod­ucts that build up.</p>
    <p>At about 2.4 years of age, the find­ings showed, sleep’s pri­mary func­tion changed from build­ing and cut­ting con­nec­tions dur­ing REM sleep to neu­ral re­pair dur­ing both REM and non-REM sleep.</p>
    <p>“It was shock­ing to us that this tran­si­tion was like a switch and so sharp,” said Dr Van Sav­age, a pro­fes­sor of ecol­ogy and evo­lu­tion­ary bi­ol­ogy and of com­pu­ta­tional medicine at Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Los An­ge­les, who is a se­nior au­thor of the re­search pub­lished in the jour­nal Science Ad­vances.</p>
    <p>REM sleep de­clines with age. New­borns, who can sleep about 16 hours daily, spend about 50 per cent of their sleep­ing time in REM but there is a pro­nounced drop-off at around 2.4 years. It drops to about 25 per cent by age 10 and to about 10 per cent to 15 per cent around age 50.</p>
    <p>“Sleep is re­quired across the an­i­mal king­dom and is nearly as ubiq­ui­tous as eat­ing and breath­ing,” Dr Sav­age said. “I’d say it is a pil­lar of hu­man health.”</p>
