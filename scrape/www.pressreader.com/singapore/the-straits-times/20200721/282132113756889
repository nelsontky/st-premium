    <p>Fo­rum writer Chin Hui Wen at­tributes my (and per­haps oth­ers’) per­cep­tion of in­tol­er­ance of pro-es­tab­lish­ment views as a mis­un­der­stand­ing of the more abra­sive tone adopted in on­line dis­course nowa­days (Don’t judge ar­gu­ments based on tone, July 17). Un­for­tu­nately, I do not think this is a mat­ter of tone.</p>
    <p>I am in com­plete agree­ment with Ms Chin that in the free mar­ket­place of ideas, dif­fer­ent peo­ple con­vey their ideas with dif­fer­ent de­grees of force­ful­ness. To the ex­tent that the tone adopted is not indica­tive of bad faith, I agree that we should fo­cus on the ar­gu­ments put forth and not be hung up on the tone adopted.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the phe­nom­e­non I was com­ment­ing on is not a mat­ter of tone (Alarmed by in­tol­er­ance of op­pos­ing view­points, July 14).</p>
    <p>To dis­credit an ar­gu­ment in a mer­i­to­ri­ous, even if abra­sive, man­ner is ac­cept­able and even laud­able.</p>
    <p>But what I have ob­served is that points (mostly voic­ing pro-es­tab­lish­ment views) are dis­missed not on the ba­sis of any lack of merit, but be­cause the per­son es­pous­ing those views are la­belled, among other things, “big­ots” or “boomers”. On this ba­sis, whole ar­gu­ments are de­rided on the ba­sis of the per­son mak­ing them.</p>
    <p>Such sweep­ing judg­ments and cen­so­ri­ous be­hav­iour are indica­tive of the pres­ence of ide­o­logues among us.</p>
    <p>This is dan­ger­ous for so­ci­ety. In such a sit­u­a­tion, ide­ol­ogy stands in place of true knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>And the know-it-all ap­proach char­ac­ter­is­tic of ide­o­logues not only drowns out at­tempts at rea­soned de­bate on both sides of the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum, but also chills any de­sire to ex­press views con­trary to those held by such ide­o­logues.</p>
    <p>De­bates on the mer­its of op­pos­ing view­points are what we should strive to­wards. This can be seen, for ex­am­ple, in Work­ers’ Party MP Ja­mus Lim’s re­cent Face­book post ex­plain­ing why a min­i­mum wage model should be adopted in place of, or in ad­di­tion to, the pro­gres­sive wage model.</p>
    <p>Point­ing out the flaws and in­ad­e­qua­cies of a cer­tain pol­icy and mak­ing rea­soned pro­pos­als should be the way for­ward. The run­ning to one’s ide­o­log­i­cal camp when faced with op­pos­ing view­points, only to launch ad hominem at­tacks, needs to end.</p>
