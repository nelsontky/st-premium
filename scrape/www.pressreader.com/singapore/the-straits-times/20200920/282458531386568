    <p>When Amer­i­can ac­tress Bella Thorne said she had made US$2 mil­lion (S$2.7 mil­lion) on sub­scrip­tion-based con­tent plat­form On­lyFans in a week, the record-break­ing amount raised eye­brows.</p>
    <p>But the plat­form, known for its adult en­ter­tain­ment con­tent, has long been seen as a safe, re­mote and lu­cra­tive way for con­tent cre­ators to make a liv­ing, even be­fore it re­ceived celebrity at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the pan­demic, the plat­form’s user base grew as more peo­ple stayed home.</p>
    <p>For some on the plat­form, like a lo­cal full-time cos­player who wants to be known only as Vanessa, its vi­a­bil­ity as a rev­enue stream is clear.</p>
    <p>Ms Vanessa, who is in her 20s and cos­plays un­der the name Kiyo, started an On­lyFans ac­count in Jan­uary. It be­came in­ac­tive af­ter a month when she found it hard to post daily. She even­tu­ally re­vamped her ac­count last month to do so.</p>
    <p>Since then, she has gained more than 170 fans, who each pay a sub­scrip­tion fee of US$10 a month. Though the plat­form is known for its risque con­tent, Ms Vanessa says she does not post nude pic­tures, only daily shots of her­self in ca­sual wear, cos­play or boudoir shoots in lin­gerie.</p>
    <p>“I have a pinned post on On­lyFans which states clearly what sort of posts I don’t do. I might post short videos or gifs, but I don’t do nudes, we­b­cams or pay-per-view (ad­di­tional, ex­clu­sive con­tent of­fered for a fee). I never do any­thing that makes me feel un­com­fort­able,” she says.</p>
    <p>De­spite her growing fan base on On­lyFans, Ms Vanessa’s main money-mak­ing plat­form is Pa­treon, a sim­i­lar sub­scrip­tion­based plat­form which al­lows users or “pa­trons” to access ex­clu­sive con­tent based on how much money they give.</p>
    <p>She has eight tiers of sub­scrip­tions, rang­ing from US$5 to US$250 a month. Her most pop­u­lar tier is the US$50 tier, which gives users access to her more sug­ges­tive pho­tos. She does around five photo shoots a month for her dif­fer­ent ac­counts.</p>
    <p>On the dif­fer­ence be­tween the two plat­forms, she says: “I feel like those on On­lyFans want quan­tity over qual­ity. On Pa­treon, I make sure the pho­tos are of high res­o­lu­tion and taken with a pro­fes­sional cam­era. But with On­lyFans, it can be pic­tures taken ca­su­ally on my phone, but up­loaded daily.”</p>
    <p>She has been on Pa­treon for more than five years and has around 120 pa­trons now. With th­ese t wo sources of in­come, she earns $1,500 to $3,000 a month.</p>
    <p>She also streams on Twitch, a live-stream­ing plat­form where view­ers can “do­nate” di­rectly to stream­ers or give them in-plat­form cur­rency to “sup­port” them – though that is only a small part of her in­come.</p>
    <p>Th­ese plat­forms usu­ally take a cut of the sub­scrip­tion fees.</p>
    <p>Asked if she was ner­vous when she be­gan pos­ing for boudoir pho­tos three years ago, Ms Vanessa says: “I was wor­ried about what other peo­ple would say and think of me, but the cos­play com­mu­nity was quite ac­cept­ing.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “No­body re­ally has a right to say any­thing about your body. It’s none of their busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>For other Sin­ga­pore­ans such as Mr Ho Wei Rong, 28, Pa­treon and Twitch are their main sources of in­come.</p>
    <p>The we­b­comics au­thor known as Car­il­lus is the cre­ator of the ur­ban fan­tasy comic se­ries ExCo – which has more than 100,000 fol­low­ers on the on­line comics site Webtoons.com. He has 2,400 fol­low­ers on Twitch – he streams his draw­ing process – and around 10 pa­trons on Pa­treon.</p>
    <p>Mr Ho is an artist for comics cre­ated by Mer­ry­weather, a Dan­ish comics cre­ator based i n Ja­pan. Mer­ry­weather has more than 1,400 pa­trons and pays Mr Ho a monthly in­come for his work.</p>
    <p>“I can earn a healthy mid­dle-class in­come this way, $3,000 to $5,000, de­pend­ing on how much work I’m will­ing to take on,” says Mr Ho, who has been a full-time we­b­comics artist for two years.</p>
    <p>This is an in­come stream which has stayed stable de­spite the im­pact of Covid-19 on the econ­omy. “If any­thing, peo­ple are spend­ing more time at home and on­line. I’ve ac­tu­ally seen a slight in­crease in rev­enue,” Mr Ho adds.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also pushed lo­cal Twitch stream­ers Min and Kochi i nto full-time stream­ing. They are vir­tual stream­ers who stream un­der an an­i­mated per­sona and do not show their faces or re­veal per­sonal de­tails.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Kochi was look­ing for a job in events mar­ket­ing when the pan­demic hit, while Min was a free­lance il­lus­tra­tor.</p>
    <p>“In normal cir­cum­stances, we would still have looked for jobs out­side of Twitch, but this gave us the push to be­come full-time stream­ers. And with Covid-19, more peo­ple stayed home so our fol­low­ers grew faster too,” Min says.</p>
    <p>Min, known as Min­i­mal Art on­line, streams her process of draw­ing on her chan­nel, which has over 900 fol­low­ers. Kochi, known as Kochi Catur­teer on­line, streams her process of cre­at­ing an­i­ma­tion for more than 700 fol­low­ers. They work to­gether on com­mis­sion­based projects such as re­quests for an­i­mated avatars or draw­ings.</p>
    <p>“Just Twitch alone is not vi­able, but we get com­mis­sions and clients from Twitch – that’s where we can get a bet­ter in­come,” Kochi adds.</p>
    <p>Each earns US$200 to US$400 from Twitch and US$1,000 to US$2,000 for com­mis­sions, which fetches US$25 to US$50 for an hour of work.</p>
    <p>Twitch has also been a life­line for Ms Amanda Lim, now a full-time streamer on the plat­form. Ms Lim, in her 20s, was pre­vi­ously stream­ing while work­ing as a make-up artist at Univer­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore. But she was let go af­ter the park closed due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With over 16,000 fol­low­ers on Twitch, Ms Lim streams reg­u­larly, some­times up to 13 hours at a go. She streams her­self play­ing games like the pop­u­lar strat­egy video game Dota 2, though she also has other con­tent, like cook­ing or play­ing board games with her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“More peo­ple started watch­ing streams be­cause of Covid-19. I used to get 60 to 70 views, but now I get 100 to 200 views,” she says.</p>
    <p>She is also a streamer un­der Resur­gence, a South-east Asian es­ports team based here.</p>
    <p>She de­clined to re­veal how much she makes off Twitch, but says it is a vi­able ca­reer. Still, she hopes to find other sources of in­come. “It’s just not very stable,” she says.</p>
    <p>She adds that stream­ing is far from easy money. It re­quires a high level of com­mit­ment and en­gage­ment with fans, she says.</p>
    <p>“Con­nec­tion, meet­ing new peo­ple and cre­at­ing new and in­ter­est­ing con­tent are the most im­por­tant things to a streamer. You have to keep up with trends. If not, peo­ple lose in­ter­est quickly.”</p>
