    <p>Sin­ga­pore pad­dler Feng Tian­wei (left) lost her first com­pet­i­tive match in eight months yes­ter­day, fall­ing 4-2 to world No. 27 Lily Zhang in the round of 16 of the In­ter­na­tional Ta­ble Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion Women’s World Cup in China. The world No. 9 ad­mit­ted that she could not get used to the match tempo.</p>
    <p>Un­able to shake off eight months of com­pet­i­tive ring rust, Sin­ga­pore’s world No. 9 Feng Tian­wei lost 4-2 (11-7, 11-8, 11-9, 8-11, 8-11, 13-11) to world No. 27 Lily Zhang in the round of 16 of the In­ter­na­tional Ta­ble Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion (ITTF) Women’s World Cup in Wei­hai, China yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The duo’s only pre­vi­ous meet­ing was also in this com­pe­ti­tion, when Feng beat the Amer­i­can 4-1 to win the bronze medal last year.</p>
    <p>Feng’s last event was the Qatar Open in March, af­ter which she re­turned to Sin­ga­pore as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure dur­ing the early stages of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The two-month cir­cuit breaker also meant she re­sumed train­ing only in June.</p>
    <p>Zhang also had a shaky start to her cam­paign, but un­like Feng who gained di­rect en­try to the knock­out rounds based on her rank­ing, the 24-year-old over­came a 4-2 loss to Ukraine’s Mar­garyta Pe­sot­ska in her open­ing group game to beat Puerto Rico’s Adriana Diaz 4-2 and Canada’s Zhang Mo 4-3 and progress.</p>
    <p>Feng, 34, said: “The key thing was this was my first match in a long while and I could not get used to the match tempo. It never feels good to lose, but I was pleased with how I fought when I was down by three games.”</p>
    <p>In a gru­elling match that lasted 57 min­utes, Zhang had raced to a 3-0 lead, only for Feng to pull two games back.</p>
    <p>But Feng, win­ner of an Olympic sil­ver and two bronzes, could not close out the sixth game de­spite a 10-7 ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>Feng’s coach He Keyi said: “That was the turn­ing point, be­cause if Tian­wei had made it 3-3, I’m sure she would have won the match.</p>
    <p>“Today, Tian­wei didn’t set­tle down fast enough and couldn’t play to the best of her abil­i­ties be­cause it was her first match.</p>
    <p>“But los­ing is part of the process and it doesn’t mean we have not made progress in the past few months.</p>
    <p>“It’s just that there are new con­di­tions and strate­gies to get used to, and in the process there will be road bumps for us to over­come.</p>
    <p>“The de­feat today will af­fect the points that count to­wards the Olympic seed­ings next year, but our tar­get hasn’t changed.</p>
    <p>“We are aim­ing for an Olympic medal and we will con­tinue to train hard and win more matches.”</p>
    <p>Feng will now set her sights on the Nov 19-22 ITTF Fi­nals in Zhengzhou, be­fore she trav­els to Ma­cau for a pro­mo­tional World Ta­ble Ten­nis show­case event from Nov 25-29.</p>
    <p>Zhang’s run at the World Cup was halted yes­ter­day af­ter a 4-0 loss to top-ranked Chen Meng in the quar­ter-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese player will face Ger­many’s Han Ying in the semi-fi­nals today while com­pa­triot Sun Ying­sha is up against Mima Ito of Ja­pan.</p>
