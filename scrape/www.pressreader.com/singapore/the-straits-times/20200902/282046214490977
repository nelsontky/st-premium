    <p>Yeo Wan Ling Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo, di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ (NTUC) small and medium-sized en­ter­prise arm and its Women and Fam­ily Unit, said her hope for Sin­ga­pore­ans is that they would con­tinue to cham­pion kind­ness and em­pa­thy in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>While the Govern­ment will work hard to build so­cial safety nets and im­ple­ment poli­cies to en­sure the coun­try emerges stronger from the pan­demic, the com­mu­nity must band to­gether as that is what Sin­ga­pore­ans lean on dur­ing tough times, she added.</p>
    <p>“When we’re will­ing to lis­ten, ev­ery­one’s a win­ner. Be it at home or at work, it would go such a long way if we all fos­tered an in­ter­est in each other’s lives and un­cov­ered the sto­ries that lie be­neath.”</p>
    <p>Der­rick Goh Nee Soon GRC</p>
    <p>Mr Goh, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at DBS Bank, said that good poli­cies must be com­ple­mented by good ex­e­cu­tion, as only to­gether would they lead to good gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>He high­lighted two ex­am­ples where de­liv­ery “fell a lit­tle short” – when there was un­hap­pi­ness among some res­i­dents un­clear on why they did not qual­ify for the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme, as well as lim­i­ta­tions in the Trace­To­gether app that slowed the abil­ity to do quick con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenge for Sin­ga­pore is how do we con­tinue to re­fine and de­velop a more cit­i­zen-cen­tric gov­er­nance model, where poli­cies are not sacro­sanct, but rather a means to an end.”</p>
    <p>Mohd Fahmi Ali­man Marine Pa­rade GRC Mayor of South East Dis­trict</p>
    <p>Mr Fahmi, NTUC di­rec­tor of op­er­a­tions and mo­bil­i­sa­tion di­vi­sion sec­re­tar­iat, said the Work­fare Spe­cial Pay­ment could be in­creased to com­ple­ment the pro­gres­sive wage model and ac­knowl­edge the so­cial value of es­sen­tial ser­vice work­ers.</p>
    <p>He also asked for more sup­port for care­givers, more frank con­ver­sa­tions on men­tal health is­sues and a sus­tain­able model to up­lift madrasahs here.</p>
    <p>Raeesah Khan Sengkang GRC</p>
    <p>Ms Khan, a so­cial en­ter­prise founder, spoke on the accessibil­ity of op­por­tu­ni­ties for those from dis­ad­van­taged back­grounds. She called for bet­ter sup­port for such stu­dents from a young age, and for teach­ers to be trained to sup­port them holis­ti­cally and not just aca­dem­i­cally.</p>
    <p>For young Sin­ga­pore­ans to mat­ter in the next phase of Sin­ga­pore’s devel­op­ment, they need to have a seat at the ta­ble, she added, and one way to do so would be to lower the vot­ing age to 18.</p>
    <p>“We en­vi­sion a coun­try that’s able to have open and frank con­ver­sa­tions about a di­rec­tion we’d like to see our home move to­wards. We may be young in age and less ex­pe­ri­enced in life, but it does not mean we do not un­der­stand the im­por­tant is­sues that the coun­try faces.”</p>
    <p>“Once this cri­sis has passed, I hope that we con­tinue to value the work of our es­sen­tial work­ers. I urge the tri­par­tite part­ners to con­tinue to sup­port them and their ef­forts to con­tinue to up­skill and earn a dig­ni­fied liv­ing.”</p>
