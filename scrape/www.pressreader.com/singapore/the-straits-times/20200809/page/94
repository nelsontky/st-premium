        | | B26 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 9, 2020 He notes that CPF has made the most improvemen­t in its rankings in the past decade because of the Government’s support for low-income workers, as well as changes in recent years to plug gaps, such as the introducti­on of CPF Life which guarantees lifelong payments.
Prof Cherian says recommenda­tions to open CPF-like benefits to private plans and to non-residents have not taken off here because the CPF rates of up to 6 per cent in the various accounts are heavily subsidised by the Government.
Many foreigners would rush to park their money in CPF if this is allowed as there is nowhere else they can get such a good rate, he adds.
Prof Cherian supports the suggestion to increase the age at which CPF members can access savings set aside for retirement, noting that all the experts are unanimous in their view that such funds must be preserved l onger as life expectanci­es rise.
“That’s what America and many other developed countries have done in their retirement schemes. For example, America’s social security retirement age is now 67 in order to receive full benefits, and there even is a financial bonus for delayed retirement beyond that,” he adds.
While the CPF is held up as one of the best retirement schemes in the world, there are still people who are very critical about it.
Prof Cherian says this is not a situation that is unique to Singapore: “There is always a disconnect between the perception­s, wants and wishful thinking of members saving for retirement versus the realities of an adequate, sustainabl­e and trustworth­y retirement scheme, as per the opinion of retirement experts.”
For example, plan members in the United States complain about the high commission­s and management fees charged for the scheme although these have been reduced over the years.
Another complaint is that an American retiree still needs to pay tax on his retirement payments, unlike CPF, which is tax-free.
Some Singaporea­ns are unhappy because they feel that their “retirement goalposts have changed on them over the years”.
For instance, there are two groups of retirees who are under different schemes – the older Retirement Sum Scheme, which offers monthly payments so long as members still have funds in their retirement account, and the CPF Life scheme, which offers lifelong payments.
While those on the old scheme can opt in to CPF Life, not everyone understand­s why they should do so, even though the scheme is better.
There are also people who bemoan that they have low retirement savings.
“Herein lies another problem,” Prof Cherian says. “We tend to dig into our retirement savings pot for housing and education during our accumulati­on or working years. Such invasion of principal at an early stage of the accumulati­on period has a devastatin­g effect on long-term retirement values.
“All retirement experts worth their salt would agree that allowing members to withdraw all their retirement funds by age 55 isn’t prudent.
“Rather, converting sufficient accumulate­d savings into a life annuity payout scheme, which can support your retirement expenses and needs, is the more prudent and sustainabl­e solution. Anything over and above that should be yours to keep.” Singapore’s CPF is ranked 7th in the Global Pension Index Grades Ranks 1 2 Netherland­s Denmark A first class and robust retirement income system that delivers good benefits, is sustainabl­e and has a high level of integrity. 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Australia Finland Sweden Norway Singapore New Zealand Canada

Without these improvemen­ts, its efficacy and sustainabi­lity are in doubt. Invest Editor A group of overseas financial experts have again confirmed what many Singaporea­ns already know – that the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is one of the world’s best retirement schemes.
The Melbourne Mercer Global Pension Index 2019, which studies retirement schemes of 37 countries, put Singapore’s CPF at No. 7, behind the Netherland­s in first place, followed by Denmark, Australia, Finland, Sweden and Norway.
Singapore is tops in Asia, with Hong Kong (15th), Malaysia (17th), Indonesia (28th), South Korea (29th), China (30th) and Japan (31st) trailing behind.
Only the Netherland­s and Denmark get an “A” grade for having “a first-class and robust retirement income system that delivers good benefits, is sustainabl­e and has a high level of integrity”, noted the Monash Centre for Financial Studies, which did the ranking with its panel of experts.
Both these countries have a multi-pillar system for retirement income, which roughly covers basic pensions for all, mandatory public and personal plans, and voluntary schemes.
Along with 10 other countries, Singapore was awarded a “B” grade, which means its retirement scheme “has a sound structure, with many good features, but has some areas for improvemen­t that differenti­ates it from an A-grade system”.
The report notes the CPF’s strengths, such as allowing members to use funds for housing and medical needs, while still preserving the benefits for retirement.
It also mentions the prescribed minimum amounts that are required to be drawn down at retirement age in the form of a lifetime income stream through CPF Life.
“The Singapore Government has implemente­d changes to CPF in 2016 which include providing minimum pension top-up amounts for the poorest individual­s, more flexi- Source: THE MELBOURNE MERCER GLOBAL PENSION INDEX SUNDAY TIMES GRAPHICS can withdraw only the remainder, or just $5,000 if they don’t have enough funds.
But experts believe that allowing any withdrawal of CPF at 55 is just too early, considerin­g that the average longevity of Singaporea­ns is above 80.
However, the panel may have overlooked the fact that not all Singaporea­ns will touch their CPF at 55. An increasing number of savvy savers leave the money there to grow with a minimum 2.5 per cent interest rate.
Many also continue to do cash top-ups for themselves as well as their relatives to enjoy up to $14,000 of tax relief annually.
Professor Joseph Cherian, practice professor of finance at the National University of Singapore Business School, was one of the experts involved in compiling the pension index. bility in drawing down retirement pension amounts and increases to certain contributi­on rates and interest guarantees,” says the report.
But it adds that Singapore could improve its overall ranking if it looks into three specific areas: Make it easier to set up tax-approved group corporate and private retirement plans. Open CPF to non-residents who comprise a significan­t percentage of the labour force. Increase the age at which CPF members can access savings set aside for retirement, as Singaporea­ns live longer. • • • The last of these recommenda­tions is the most contentiou­s as some Singaporea­ns already complain that they cannot withdraw all their money from their CPF at 55.
