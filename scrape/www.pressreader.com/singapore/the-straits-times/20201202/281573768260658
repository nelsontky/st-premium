    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said in court yes­ter­day that he did not have com­plete free­dom of ac­tion to over­ride his Cabi­net’s po­si­tion on not de­mol­ish­ing his late fa­ther’s home. Tes­ti­fy­ing on day two of the hear­ing on his suit against The On­line Ci­ti­zen editor Terry Xu, PM Lee also said that Mr Lee Kuan Yew un­der­stood his son’s con­sid­er­a­tions and con­straints as head of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said in court yes­ter­day that he did not have com­plete free­dom of ac­tion to over­ride his Cabi­net min­is­ters’ po­si­tion on not de­mol­ish­ing the home of his late fa­ther at 38 Ox­ley Road.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, tes­ti­fy­ing on the se­cond day of the hear­ing on his li­bel suit against The On­line Ci­ti­zen (TOC) editor Terry Xu, also said his fa­ther Lee Kuan Yew un­der­stood his con­sid­er­a­tions and con­straints as head of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>He also re­jected a re­peated charge by the de­fen­dant’s lawyer Lim Tean that he “called the shots” when it came to han­dling the property.</p>
    <p>PM Lee is su­ing Mr Xu over a TOC ar­ti­cle, pub­lished in Au­gust last year, that pointed to claims by his sis­ter, Dr Lee Wei Ling, that her brother had mis­led their fa­ther into think­ing 38 Ox­ley Road had been gazetted by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In his cross-ex­am­i­na­tion of PM Lee, Mr Lim asked why he could not over­ride Cabi­net min­is­ters, who in a July 2011 meet­ing had – counter to Mr Lee’s wishes – op­posed knock­ing down the Ox­ley Road house.</p>
    <p>“As the prime min­is­ter, I have to put aside my fam­ily con­sid­er­a­tions,” said PM Lee. “It’s my duty, I swore an oath to do so.”</p>
    <p>Over­rid­ing the min­is­ters based on his fa­ther’s wishes would be go­ing against that oath and do­ing wrong by Sin­ga­pore, he added.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said that af­ter the Cabi­net meet­ing, he gave Mr Lee his hon­est as­sess­ment of what the Gov­ern­ment would do with the house af­ter Mr Lee’s death.</p>
    <p>“I told him that he had met the Cabi­net and heard the min­is­ters’ views. I said that if I chaired the Cabi­net meet­ing, given that th­ese were the views of the min­is­ters and the pub­lic, I thought that it would be very hard for me to over­ride them and knock the house down.</p>
    <p>“I added that I would have to agree that the house had to be gazetted to be kept, and if I was not the prime min­is­ter or I did not chair the meet­ing, all the more likely the house would be gazetted. Mr Lee un­der­stood.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim then re­ferred to an email sent by Dr Lee to her fa­ther, in which she wrote: “Hav­ing lived here for so many years I have ad­justed... you call the shots. I am de­lighted to stay at Ox­ley.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said to PM Lee: “Your fa­ther replies to her later that evening... ‘I can­not call the shots. Loong as PM has the fi­nal word.’ Your fa­ther here was stat­ing the ob­vi­ous, isn’t it? You call the shots... It is not your min­is­ters, it is not your Cabi­net as you would like us to be­lieve?”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim pro­duced an­other email from the late Mr Lee which read: “Even if I knock it down while I am alive the PM can gazette it as a her­itage site and stop the de­mo­li­tion.”</p>
    <p>This showed that Mr Lee was talk­ing, at all times, about his son be­ing the de­ci­sion-maker, not the Cabi­net, said Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>PM Lee replied: “I am the prime min­is­ter. I have a view. If I say my fa­ther would like the house knocked down, the min­is­ters will con­sider it. It is not pos­si­ble for me to go against the min­is­ters, as I ex­plained to my fa­ther and my fa­ther ac­knowl­edged.</p>
    <p>“I had ex­plained to him what I would have to do if I were the de­ci­sion-maker. In other words, I really didn’t have free­dom of ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim then said: “I am sug­gest­ing to you that af­ter the Cabi­net meet­ing of July 21, 2011, your fa­ther was dis­traught, be­cause as the prime min­is­ter of this coun­try from 1959 to 1990, he knew that no Cabi­net of his would have op­posed him on an is­sue of this kind, and he knew that no Cabi­net of yours would have op­posed you if you had said you wanted de­mo­li­tion. That’s right, isn’t it?”</p>
    <p>“That is wrong,” said PM Lee. “He knew that you called the shots?” said Mr Lim.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are po­lit­i­cal state­ments, not ques­tions,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Au­drey Lim re­buked Mr Lim at this junc­ture, say­ing: “If you want to ask a ques­tion, it should be in the form of a ques­tion. You are mak­ing a lot of state­ments.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee then re­it­er­ated that his fa­ther un­der­stood where both the Cabi­net and his son stood.</p>
    <p>“When he wrote to Cabi­net in De­cem­ber 2011, he said the min­is­ters have unan­i­mously ex­pressed their view that the house should not be de­mol­ished,” said PM Lee. “He did not say the prime min­is­ter has told the min­is­ters that he will not de­mol­ish the house.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim then said: “I am sug­gest­ing to you that your fa­ther knew that you called the shots and that you were not supporting him... It was con­ve­nient for you to say that it was pres­sure from oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>“I re­ject that to­tally and I have ex­plained why,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>Chang­ing tack, Mr Lim said: “Your sib­lings are cor­rect, when they say you wanted to keep the house to in­herit Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s cred­i­bil­ity? The prime min­is­ter liv­ing in 38 Ox­ley Road would re­mind the pub­lic of your fa­ther, won’t it?”</p>
    <p>“That is rub­bish,” said PM Lee. “Sin­ga­pore­ans know me. I have been in pol­i­tics now since 1984 – 36 years. I have been prime min­is­ter for 16 years and if I still de­pend on liv­ing in a par­tic­u­lar house in or­der to ex­ude a magic aura and over­awe and im­press the pop­u­la­tion, I think I am in a very sad state and Sin­ga­pore would be in a very sad state,” he added.</p>

    <p>PRIME MIN­IS­TER LEE HSIEN LOONG, re­fer­ring to the claim that he wanted to keep the house at 38 Ox­ley Road “to in­herit Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s cred­i­bil­ity”.</p>
