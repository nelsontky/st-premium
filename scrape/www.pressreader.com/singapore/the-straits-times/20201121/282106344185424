    <p>The chal­lenge of deal­ing with the needs of peo­ple with de­men­tia is greater when the care­giver does not know what those needs are (El­derly neigh­bour with de­men­tia is a vic­tim and needs help, Nov 19).</p>
    <p>Even peo­ple with de­men­tia may fail to un­der­stand what they need; they just know they are un­com­fort­able and are un­able to com­mu­ni­cate it to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>We are so­cial peo­ple; we thrive in the con­text of re­la­tion­ships. So do many of those with de­men­tia, who are of­ten des­per­ate for hu­man com­pan­ion­ship and an es­cape from lone­li­ness.</p>
    <p>It is easy to for­get that they are unique peo­ple with needs, abil­i­ties and po­ten­tial. All too of­ten, the needs and feel­ings of peo­ple with de­men­tia are dis­counted even within fam­i­lies as well as by those in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Recog­nis­ing peo­ple’s dig­nity re­quires us to try to un­der­stand what they in­tend and, as much as pos­si­ble, en­sure that they un­der­stand us.</p>
    <p>When those with de­men­tia have trou­ble choos­ing the right word, they might ap­pre­ci­ate a sug­ges­tion; at other times, they might find that in­sult­ing. A great deal of sen­si­tiv­ity is re­quired in our ef­forts to re­spect their dig­nity.</p>
    <p>At such times, we can ar­tic­u­late what we think they mean and ask them if we are right. If we try to cor­rectly in­ter­pret their ef­forts to com­mu­ni­cate, we are re­spect­ing their dig­nity.</p>
    <p>Re­spect­ing au­ton­omy is not al­ways easy. At times we have to pro­tect peo­ple with de­men­tia from mak­ing mis­takes that would un­der­mine their dig­nity and dis­credit their rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>It has of­ten been said that there are four Ds in our later years: de­pres­sion, dis­ease, de­men­tia and death.</p>
    <p>Any one of these can be dif­fi­cult, but for many, de­men­tia is the great­est chal­lenge. Sher­man Goh Keng Hwee</p>
