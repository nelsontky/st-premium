    <p>For­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad yes­ter­day de­nied a claim that he was be­hind a move in Fe­bru­ary to form the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion with Malay par­ties from both sides of the aisle, re­it­er­at­ing that he would not team up with “klep­to­crats” in the Umno lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter for Econ­omy Azmin Ali made the claim in an in­ter­view pub­lished in The Star on Sun­day, dur­ing which he also “re­vealed” that Tun Dr Ma­hathir was meant to re­main as PM with PN.</p>
    <p>“I have re­peat­edly ex­plained that it’s un­true be­cause PN is made up of klep­to­crats and is backed by Umno en bloc. If I were the one who planned it, why am I against it... and if I had ac­cepted it, I would’ve def­i­nitely re­mained as the prime min­is­ter as claimed by Azmin,” Dr Ma­hathir said.</p>
    <p>He added that it was Datuk Seri Azmin who hatched the plan to leave the then-rul­ing Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion to form a new gov­ern­ment with Umno, and to fur­ther his am­bi­tion of even­tu­ally be­com­ing premier.</p>
    <p>“If there was any­one who had earnestly planned to form PN and exit PH, it would have def­i­nitely been Azmin and Muhyid­din who had gained the most. Don’t for­get, when all this was hap­pen­ing, Azmin’s po­si­tion in Kead­i­lan and PH was un­der threat,” he added, re­fer­ring to Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin and Mr Azmin’s for­mer party Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR).</p>
    <p>Af­ter the col­lapse of the PH gov­ern­ment, Tan Sri Muhyid­din was ap­pointed PM on March 1 and he con­tin­ues to lead the PN ad­min­is­tra­tion, al­beit with a slim ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment. Mr Azmin is now a se­nior min­is­ter and widely seen as the de facto deputy PM.</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing the events lead­ing up to the fall of PH, Dr Ma­hathir said Mr Azmin was at risk of los­ing his place in the PKR lead­er­ship hi­er­ar­chy af­ter a video of him pur­port­edly en­gag­ing in a ho­mo­sex­ual af­fair went vi­ral and his re­la­tion­ship with party pres­i­dent An­war Ibrahim de­te­ri­o­rated to the point that it be­came “un­ten­able”.</p>
    <p>“This is be­cause to him (Azmin), the most im­por­tant thing is to block An­war from be­com­ing PM. If PH were to con­tinue to rule, it is a sure thing that An­war would have had the chance of be­com­ing PM,” Dr Ma­hathir said, adding that he was con­vinced Mr Azmin had been plan­ning the for­ma­tion of PN for some time.</p>
    <p>In the in­ter­view, Mr Azmin claimed Dr Ma­hathir was meant to re­main as PM with the new coali­tion, which was to in­clude Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu), as well as then op­po­si­tion par­ties Umno and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the plan did not have the ex­plicit ap­proval of Ber­satu’s al­lies in PH – PKR, the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party and Parti Amanah Ne­gara.</p>
