    <p>French Open chief Guy For­get yes­ter­day ad­mit­ted that a gov­ern­ment or­der to limit at­ten­dance at Roland Gar­ros to a max­i­mum of 1,000 fans each day was a “tough blow” for the Grand Slam.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers of the clay-court tour­na­ment, which gets un­der way to­mor­row in Paris four months later than orig­i­nally planned, had hoped for a max­i­mum of 5,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>That fig­ure had al­ready been twice re­vised, first from 20,000 to 11,500, and on Thurs­day, the French gov­ern­ment de­clared that tougher re­stric­tions were needed to counter the resur­gence of the coro­n­avirus in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“We’ve taken note of the gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion. We’re ready, all the play­ers are here, but it’s true it’s a tough blow for the tour­na­ment,” said For­get, who had hoped the strict safety mea­sures such as the com­pul­sory wear­ing of masks for ev­ery­one and safe dis­tanc­ing would ap­pease the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>French Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said that the Grand Slam, the fi­nal one of this sea­son, must be sub­ject to the same re­stric­tions as all other sports events tak­ing place in the des­ig­nated “red zones”, where there is a sec­ond wave of the Covid-19 dis­ease.</p>
    <p>“We will ap­ply the same rules at Roland Gar­ros as else­where,” he said. “We go from 5,000 to 1,000.”</p>
    <p>Sources told Agence FrancePres­se, how­ever, that the fig­ure does not in­clude cre­den­tial hold­ers such as of­fi­cials, the me­dia, play­ers and staff.</p>
    <p>The daily limit of 1, 000 fans over 15 days rep­re­sents less than 3 per cent of last year’s to­tal at­ten­dance of al­most 520, 000.</p>
    <p>There will also be fi­nan­cial reper­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>Last year, Roland Gar­ros ac­counted for around 80 per cent of the French Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion’s bud­get – €255.4 mil­lion (S$409.7 mil­lion) out of a to­tal €325 mil­lion – with ticket sales gen­er­at­ing nearly 20 per cent of to­tal tour­na­ment rev­enue.</p>
    <p>But de­spite the strin­gent cap on crowd size, the French Open is set to be­come just the sec­ond event af­ter last week’s Ital­ian Open in Rome, to al­low for spec­ta­tors in some sort of ca­pac­ity since the ATP and WTA tours were shut down from March for five months.</p>
    <p>The US Open in New York, which ended just un­der two weeks ago, banned all spec­ta­tors from its sprawl­ing Flush­ing Mead­ows com­plex, while Wim­ble­don was can­celled for the first time since World War II.</p>
