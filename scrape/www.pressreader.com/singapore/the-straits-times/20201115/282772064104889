    <p>Run­ning can be a fun ac­tiv­ity to look for­ward to when in a group and with like-minded peo­ple who have a sim­i­lar pas­sion for the sport. This can help in­di­vid­u­als stay mo­ti­vated and it is also a great way to learn from one an­other.</p>
    <p>Take the New Bal­ance Run Club (NBRC), whom I coach, for in­stance. It is a com­mu­nity with an aim to sup­port new­com­ers in kick­start­ing their run­ning jour­ney, and also gives other run­ning en­thu­si­asts a re­fresh­ing space to im­prove and achieve new goals.</p>
    <p>Join­ing a run­ning club may be in­tim­i­dat­ing at first, es­pe­cially when you are new to the sport or in a place or with peo­ple with whom you are not fa­mil­iar.</p>
    <p>If you’re wor­ried about whether you are good enough or ready to join a club, fret not, as coaches in run­ning clubs such as NBRC will be able to tai­lor the ac­tiv­i­ties and runs to those of dif­fer­ent pace.</p>
    <p>There are many ben­e­fits to join­ing a run­ning club or run­ning in a group. These in­clude:</p>
    <p>1. MEET­ING OTH­ERS LIKE YOU</p>
    <p>In a club, run­ners are of­ten sur­rounded by ex­pe­ri­enced and en­thu­si­as­tic, friendly in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ing friend­ships and join­ing oth­ers for runs out­side club ses­sions can help to make your ex­pe­ri­ence more mem­o­rable as well.</p>
    <p>By shar­ing ex­pe­ri­ences and go­ing through dif­fer­ent routes with each other, run­ners can help each other stay mo­ti­vated and also en­joy the sport for a long pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>Great friend­ships can be forged and these have even seen some go­ing on over­seas run­ning hol­i­days to­gether, such as to the Tokyo Marathon or Gold Coast Air­port Marathon.</p>
    <p>2. TEAM SPIRIT</p>
    <p>Join­ing a club or group helps to fos­ter team spirit by help­ing one an­other push to­wards faster times dur­ing train­ing and races.</p>
    <p>3. AC­COUNT­ABIL­ITY</p>
    <p>It is easy to talk your­self out of a run. Know­ing that oth­ers are wait­ing for you and have made the ef­fort to plan the group run might help to en­cour­age you to stick to the plan. Also, meet­ing oth­ers fre­quently can help to en­sure you keep to your train­ing plans.</p>
    <p>4. VA­RI­ETY</p>
    <p>Avoid get­ting bored with your usual run­ning rou­tine. In run­ning clubs, coaches will usu­ally have a va­ri­ety of pro­grammes in their train­ing plan. From run­ning new routes to dif­fer­ent types of en­durance runs, speed work­outs and more.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in my role as NBRC coach, I plan weekly ses­sions with ex­er­cises which vary week by week – from long runs to tempo runs, in­ter­vals, fartlek and even high-in­ten­sity in­ter­val train­ing ses­sions.</p>
    <p>This helps to keep you in­ter­ested in the sport over time, im­prove fit­ness lev­els by ac­ti­vat­ing dif­fer­ent mus­cle groups and dif­fer­ent en­ergy sys­tems as well.</p>
    <p>5. EX­PERT AD­VICE</p>
    <p>Run­ners can tap on their club coaches’ wealth of knowl­edge on a va­ri­ety of is­sues – from train­ing plans to the types of run­ning shoes suit­able for them.</p>
    <p>Coaches are on hand to ad­vise run­ners on the im­por­tance of pac­ing, in­jury preven­tion and re­al­is­tic goal-set­ting.</p>
    <p>As NBRC coach, I am al­ways keep­ing a look­out for wrong tech­niques or run­ning pos­tures. In or­der to im­prove clar­ity, I will usu­ally demon­strate and ex­plain the dif­fer­ent ex­er­cises and run­ning pos­tures from which they are able to learn.</p>
    <p>Our train­ing ses­sions are split into three parts – warm-up, work­out and cool-down.</p>
    <p>I brief run­ners on the ob­jec­tive of each ses­sion, the na­ture and aim of the drills and also have safety point­ers for them.</p>
    <p>6. GREATER KNOWL­EDGE</p>
    <p>Club mem­bers are usu­ally en­thu­si­as­tic about the sport, and will have ac­cu­mu­lated lots of knowl­edge and are also keen to learn.</p>
    <p>They may share their tips on the lat­est run­ning shoes, gear, gad­gets, gift ideas or even tech­ni­cal in­for­ma­tion like how to get faster.</p>
    <p>7. MO­TI­VA­TION BOOST</p>
    <p>Clock­ing long runs alone can be tough. Hav­ing a group to run with can help to make the long dis­tance feel less daunt­ing, with run­ners mo­ti­vat­ing each other to get through tough work­outs and hav­ing fun.</p>
    <p>8. SAFETY</p>
    <p>Safety comes first and run­ners can – and should – look out for each other on runs.</p>
    <p>9. IM­PROVE PER­FOR­MANCE</p>
    <p>You will face some friendly com­pe­ti­tion with other run­ners. This may in­spire you to run faster and be bet­ter than what you al­ready are.</p>
    <p>En­cour­ag­ing group mates may be able to urge you to run faster or far­ther or even en­sure you com­plete the run. Hav­ing run­ners with dif­fer­ent pace and fit­ness lev­els can help in­spire and guide other run­ners.</p>
    <p>AD­VICE FOR JOIN­ING A CLUB</p>
    <p>Talk to other run­ners, con­duct on­line re­search and find out more about the club and the coaches be­fore at­tend­ing a ses­sion.</p>
    <p>After nar­row­ing down your choices, find out the train­ing date, time and lo­ca­tion to see whether it fits your sched­ule be­fore you head down for a first-hand ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>A tip would be to bring a friend along at your first ses­sion, which might help you feel less in­ti­mated in the new en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>Be pa­tient. Try­ing one ses­sion may not nec­es­sar­ily be the best in­di­ca­tor of the club’s vibes.</p>
    <p>It is com­mon for new run­ners to feel that they are not as ex­pe­ri­enced as club mem­bers and some may find it a chal­lenge to fit into the new so­cial set­ting or the dy­namic of the group.</p>
    <p>It may take a while, but it is im­por­tant to feel com­fort­able and en­sure that you are able to align your pref­er­ences and goals with the mem­bers and gain the ben­e­fits of join­ing a run­ning club.</p>
