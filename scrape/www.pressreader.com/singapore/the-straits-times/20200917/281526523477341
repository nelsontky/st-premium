    <p>Bud­ding young foot­ballers from the ages of six to 18 at the Lion City Sailors Foot­ball Acad­emy will have a new multi-mil­lion-dol­lar home soon, with the Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League club plan­ning to build its own fully func­tional train­ing fa­cil­ity by 2022. It is ex­pected to cost over $10 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Bud­ding young foot­ballers from the ages of six to 18 at the Lion City Sailors Foot­ball Acad­emy will have a new multi-mil­lion dol­lar home soon, with Sin­ga­pore’s first pri­va­tised club plan­ning to build its own train­ing fa­cil­ity by 2022.</p>
    <p>Touted as the first fully func­tional train­ing cen­tre here, the venue is ex­pected to hold six ar­ti­fi­cial turf pitches – two 11-a-side, one nine-a-side, two seven-a-side, and a five-a-side – which will come up to 17,000 sq m.</p>
    <p>In order to max­imise the num­ber and size of the foot­ball fields to ac­com­mo­date its youth and adult play­ers, flex­i­ble pitch con­fig­u­ra­tions will be used. For ex­am­ple, an 11-aside pitch could be adapted to ac­com­mo­date fields.</p>
    <p>It will also boast a club­house with ded­i­cated locker rooms and show­ers for its Lion City Sailors foot­ballers – who play in the Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League – coaches, fe­male play­ers and acad­emy trainees, func­tional and re­cov­ery gyms, and a can­teen. A 200-seat view­ing gallery will also be in­te­grated into the club­house.</p>
    <p>The acad­emy’s cur­rent site at Mat­tar Road is an op­tion for the new fa­cil­ity, which is ex­pected to cost over $10 mil­lion. The club are in dis­cus­sions with the au­thor­i­ties to se­cure a long-term ex­ten­sion of the lease, which ex­pires next April.</p>
    <p>Lion City Sailors gen­eral man­ager Badri Ghent said: “We are con­sid­er­ing var­i­ous venue op­tions for this pro­posed home of the Sailors, and we are cur­rently con­sult­ing the au­four seven-a-side thor­i­ties on the mat­ter of bring­ing the pro­ject to fruition soon.”</p>
    <p>Tan Li Yu, the acad­emy’s gen­eral man­ager, told The Straits Times that “devel­op­ment work will take at least one and a half years”.</p>
    <p>The key dif­fer­ence be­tween their fa­cil­ity and other com­mer­cial foot­ball projects, he said, is that the Sailors have “no need to make money from the fa­cil­ity”.</p>
    <p>“One of the key prob­lems in Sin­ga­pore is that when fa­cil­i­ties are de­vel­oped, they need to re­cover their re­turn on in­vest­ment,” he added. “These fac­tors come into play when they con­fig­ure the pitch size, and the first thing they look at is how to max­imise re­turns to max­i­mum num­ber of book­ings.”</p>
    <p>For the Sailors, the aim is to in­stead max­imise their train­ing ef­fec­tive­ness and ef­fi­ciency and to repli­cate pitch con­di­tions in in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tions. For in­stance, the club plan to have 50m by 30m pitches for seven-a-side games.</p>
    <p>Tan noted that Sin­ga­pore sends a team to the Gothia Cup, an in­ter­na­tional youth foot­ball tour­na­ment in Swe­den which sees par­tic­i­pa­tion from over 1,700 teams from 80 na­tions each year and which uses 50m by 30m fields for such games.</p>
    <p>“That way, when our youths go over­seas for the Cup, they are al­ready ac­cus­tomed to in­ter­na­tional stan­dards,” he added.</p>
    <p>There are also plans to en­gage the com­mu­nity and they are con­sult­ing with stake­hold­ers in the fra­ter­nity to study the pos­si­bil­ity of al­low­ing grass­roots or­gan­i­sa­tions ac­cess to the fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Aside from that, the foot­ball fields will be out of bounds to the pub­lic and par­ents, who can only view the train­ing ses­sions from the view­ing gallery or cafe.</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing the ra­tio­nale be­hind this, Tan said: “This is to let the play­ers un­der­stand from a young age that they must be­have like a pro­fes­sional. They will go to the chang­ing room on their own, have their own locker and there will be no par­ent to help them pre­pare.</p>
    <p>“We want to in­tro­duce this at a very young age so they feel like a foot­ball player when they step onto the pitch.”</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently 500 play­ers in their youth and se­nior squads, in­clud­ing the acad­emy’s re­cently launched $1 mil­lion elite pro­gramme which will kick off next year with an ini­tial co­hort of 25 foot­ballers who are 12 years old.</p>
    <p>LCS’ bil­lion­aire chair­man For­rest Li had pre­vi­ously said that the aim of the re­vamped acad­emy, which was for­merly known as the LFA Pro­tec­tors, was not just to make the Sailors one of the best clubs in the re­gion, but also to “bring Sin­ga­pore foot­ball as a whole to the next level”.</p>
    <p>Tan added: “If we have one acad­emy player sign­ing for a club in Europe, just like swim­mer Joseph School­ing win­ning gold at the Olympics, it will bring joy to Sin­ga­pore. That is the ul­ti­mate aim of the acad­emy in 10 years’ time.”</p>
