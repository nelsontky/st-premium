    <p>MON­TREAL • Weightlift­ers from six coun­tries are sus­pected of sup­ply­ing false urine sam­ples af­ter an in­ves­ti­ga­tion found ev­i­dence of “dop­pel­gangers” be­ing used to im­per­son­ate ath­letes, the World An­tiDop­ing Agency (Wada) said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Wada said the 18 cases, un­cov­ered as part of a wide-rang­ing probe into the scan­dal-tainted In­ter­na­tional Weightlift­ing Fed­er­a­tion (IWF), will be for­warded to the In­ter­na­tional Test­ing Agency for review.</p>
    <p>A Wada state­ment said the fraud­u­lent urine sam­ples had been un­cov­ered af­ter the agency’s in­ves­ti­ga­tors de­vel­oped a new method­ol­ogy to iden­tify sub­sti­tuted urine with help in part from con­fi­den­tial sources and anal­y­sis ex­perts.</p>
    <p>DNA anal­y­sis found 18 cases and ev­i­dence that looka­likes had been used to im­per­son­ate ath­letes dur­ing the sam­ple col­lec­tion process, to en­sure that “clean” urine was pro­vided.</p>
    <p>The coun­tries of the ath­letes in­volved were not dis­closed.</p>
    <p>“Wada is ap­palled by what its In­tel­li­gence and In­ves­ti­ga­tions De­part­ment has un­cov­ered in this in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” pres­i­dent Wi­told Banka said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“For too long, clean weightlift­ers have had to deal with an en­trenched cul­ture of dop­ing in their sport, where the pro­mo­tion of fear en­sured that the truth re­mained hid­den and that those who wanted to do the right thing were iso­lated.</p>
    <p>“Once again, this has shown the im­por­tance of whis­tle-blower in­for­ma­tion and the pos­i­tive dif­fer­ence that can be made when peo­ple with in­for­ma­tion have the courage to come for­ward.</p>
    <p>“In­tel­li­gence from well-placed con­fi­den­tial sources, cou­pled with the dili­gent work of Wada In­tel­li­gence and In­ves­ti­ga­tions, is de­liv­er­ing sig­nif­i­cant re­sults across a host of in­ves­ti­ga­tions.”</p>
    <p>Banka said the re­sults of Wada’s probe high­lighted the need to po­ten­tially strengthen the agency’s in­ves­ti­ga­tory pow­ers, in­clud­ing grant­ing “un­fet­tered ac­cess to all rel­e­vant in­ter­nal doc­u­ments and servers within the or­gan­i­sa­tion un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion”.</p>
    <p>The dis­cov­ery was part of mul­ti­ple and on­go­ing Wada probes that be­gan in 2017, in­clud­ing Oper­a­tion Ar­row, a covert in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the prac­tice of urine sub­sti­tu­tion at the point of col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>The IWF did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Weightlift­ing has been in tur­moil since Jan­uary when a doc­u­men­tary by Ger­man TV chan­nel ARD re­vealed what it de­scribed as a “cul­ture of cor­rup­tion” in the sport in­tended to mask the use of dop­ing.</p>
