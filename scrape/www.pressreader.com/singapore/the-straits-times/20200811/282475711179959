    <p>RE­VIEW / THEATRE</p>
    <p>TWO SONGS AND A STORY Check­point Theatre Sis­tic Live/Last Fri­day</p>
    <p>Olivia Ho</p>
    <p>Two Songs And A Story is ex­actly what it says on the tin. In Check­point Theatre’s on­line se­ries, five artists per­form an orig­i­nal mono­logue and two songs each.</p>
    <p>What emerges is an in­cred­i­bly in­ti­mate set of liv­ing-room con­fes­sion­als, with mu­sic that ranges from wist­ful ukulele pluck­ing to haunt­ing elec­tronic loops.</p>
    <p>Acous­tic sets swell into mov­ing mo­ments.</p>
    <p>Inch Chua de­tails her ex­pe­ri­ences as a san­i­ta­tion vol­un­teer in mi­grant worker dor­mi­to­ries dur­ing the Covid-19 out­break, weav­ing in­tri­cate metaphors of iso­la­tion, in­su­la­tion and alien­ation.</p>
    <p>Tiny de­tails – the gui­tar left on a worker’s bed, stashes of haw flakes and mu­rukku – co­a­lesce into the aw­ful epiphany, when she is clean­ing an iso­la­tion room, that the lock is out­side the door.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times Life Theatre Award-win­ning ac­tress Jo Tan presents a light-hearted sketch of an of­fice lady, Bit Wah, who scrapes by do­ing the bare min­i­mum. Her mother ex­horts her to do more with her life, but she truly de­rives joy only from watch­ing anime.</p>
    <p>Tan, a chameleon of a per­former who has been as­sid­u­ously work­ing her way through the Covid-19 shut­down – most re­cently with her stel­lar one-woman show King – is a dead­pan de­light, even launch­ing into a full-blown anime theme tune.</p>
    <p>Two pieces tackle trauma with del­i­cate vul­ner­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Re­bekah Sangeetha Do­rai al­ludes to an abu­sive re­la­tion­ship in her past, while mu­si­cian weish, who is one half of elec­tronic duo .gif, uses the trade­mark loops of her mu­sic to con­vey the ex­pe­ri­ence of trauma.</p>
    <p>Chatty and wry on the sur­face, weish peels back lay­ers to re­veal some­thing raw and vis­ceral as she probes how trauma in­duces meta­mor­pho­sis in a per­son.</p>
    <p>The stripped-down aes­thetic of the videos, di­rected by Check­point</p>
    <p>Theatre joint artis­tic di­rec­tor Huzir Su­laiman and pho­tog­ra­pher Joel Lim, be­lies the amount of be­hindthe-scenes work re­quired for this level of pol­ish, es­pe­cially in the thought­ful cam­er­a­work.</p>
    <p>Run­ning like a bass line through the mono­logues is the no­tion of pres­ence – be­ing fully present in your life, be­ing present for some­one else. The cir­cuit breaker of­ten made phys­i­cal pres­ence im­pos­si­ble and much of the art cre­ated since has wran­gled with other ways of be­ing present.</p>
    <p>The artists flinch from pres­ence and yearn for it.</p>
    <p>“Some­thing about that act of nam­ing my de­sire for com­pany made me un­bear­able,” says ants chua, in a bit­ter­sweet rec­ol­lec­tion of the dis­so­lu­tion of a school bus friend­ship.</p>
    <p>The mono­logue from weish is shot through with the anx­i­ety that she is so raw as to be un­bear­able. It is heart­break­ing.</p>
    <p>“Do you ac­tively, truly want to be here?” she asks. “With me?”</p>
    <p>These are works cre­ated to ex­ist without pres­ence. But they in­sist, qui­etly and pow­er­fully, that you be present with them.</p>
