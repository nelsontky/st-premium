    <p>That the num­ber of sin­gle-fam­ily of­fices in Sin­ga­pore has grown over the years is telling of Sin­ga­pore’s ster­ling rep­u­ta­tion as a global fi­nan­cial cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Sin­gle-fam­ily of­fices are pri­vate com­pa­nies that man­age in­vest­ments and trusts for a sin­gle wealthy fam­ily that can in­clude sev­eral gen­er­a­tions and mul­ti­ple house­holds.</p>
    <p>Re­search has found that high-net-worth in­di­vid­u­als seek safe har­bours that are in­su­lated from risk driv­ers such as eco­nomic, fi­nan­cial and reg­u­la­tory risks, as well as pro­vide cal­i­brated ex­po­sure to the im­pact and op­por­tu­ni­ties the dig­i­tal econ­omy and tech­no­log­i­cal dis­rup­tion bring about. Sin­ga­pore ticks off all these boxes as a global fi­nan­cial cen­tre.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the Global Fi­nan­cial Cen­tres In­dex sur­vey by London-based think-tank Z/Yen and the China De­vel­op­ment In­sti­tute ranks Sin­ga­pore highly in all seg­ments of com­pet­i­tive­ness, in­clud­ing fi­nan­cial sec­tor de­vel­op­ment, business en­vi­ron­ment and rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also per­sis­tently per­forms well in other in­ter­na­tional rank­ings, such as in terms of dig­i­tal com­pet­i­tive­ness based on the IMD World Dig­i­tal Com­pet­i­tive­ness Rank­ing, and has been con­sis­tently ranked No. 1 glob­ally by the World Bank for ease of do­ing business.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also at­trac­tive to high-net-worth in­di­vid­u­als from a fis­cal per­spec­tive, for in­stance, by hav­ing a low tax rate, zero cap­i­tal gains tax, and ef­fi­cient struc­tures to man­age sin­gle-fam­ily of­fices, such as the vari­able cap­i­tal com­pany struc­ture with its tax and per­ma­nent res­i­dence in­cen­tives.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic is a com­pelling value propo­si­tion for high-net-worth in­di­vid­u­als not only to park their as­sets, but also to live and bring up their fam­i­lies in a safe ju­ris­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>Sin­gle-fam­ily of­fices also help to cre­ate jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans. For ex­am­ple, with the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board’s Global In­vestor Pro­gramme, there is the caveat that, with at least</p>
    <p>$200 mil­lion in as­sets to com­mit, a sin­gle-fam­ily of­fice must cre­ate at least a cer­tain num­ber of jobs, of which some must be filled by Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>In­deed, as ar­tic­u­lated by Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing, Sin­ga­pore re­mains re­cep­tive to top global tal­ent (S’pore to stay open to top global tal­ent as it trans­forms econ­omy, Sept 9).</p>
    <p>And even as Asia stays on course as the re­gion with the most high-net-worth in­di­vid­u­als (S’pore gains 3 bil­lion­aires as Asia-Pa­cific tops list: Report, Oct 8), it is im­per­a­tive that Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues its tra­jec­tory to grow from strength to strength.</p>
