    <p>The use of dig­i­tal de­vices has be­come part of the mod­ern Sin­ga­porean fam­ily life.</p>
    <p>In the last decade, we have wit­nessed a sig­nif­i­cant shift to­wards these de­vices, rang­ing from house­hold elec­tronic lock sys­tems to on­line gro­cery and food shop­ping.</p>
    <p>I am con­cerned about the amount of screen time that ba­bies and very young chil­dren are be­ing ex­posed to these days.</p>
    <p>Fam­ily physi­cians are see­ing more and more chil­dren show­ing sig­nif­i­cant eye­sight prob­lems, speech and lan­guage de­vel­op­men­tal de­lays and/or be­havioural is­sues con­cern­ing hy­per­ac­tiv­ity. Some of them were pre­sented at such a late stage in their lives that the prob­lem ac­tu­ally in­ter­feres with their sub­se­quent in­tel­lec­tual and be­havioural de­vel­op­ment, caus­ing fur­ther stress and anx­i­ety to their fam­i­lies. Many of these chil­dren re­quire fur­ther spe­cial­ist as­sess­ments and in­ter­ven­tions, fur­ther ag­gra­vat­ing men­tal and fi­nan­cial dis­tress.</p>
    <p>Fam­ily physi­cians find that one of the com­mon risk fac­tors is that these chil­dren used dig­i­tal de­vices ex­ces­sively at a very young age. Some of them ac­tu­ally showed good re­cov­ery when their screen time was re­placed by more nur­tur­ing parental in­ter­ac­tive ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There is now emerg­ing ev­i­dence show­ing an as­so­ci­a­tion of early use of dig­i­tal de­vices with chil­dren’s de­layed phys­i­cal, psy­choso­cial and be­havioural de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans can play a part in curb­ing the ex­ces­sive use of dig­i­tal de­vices in fam­i­lies by cre­at­ing a more holis­tic “screen-free” en­vi­ron­ment in which fam­ily mem­bers can re­late with one an­other to strengthen fam­ily sta­bil­ity and the chil­dren’s emo­tional and cul­tural in­tel­li­gence lev­els.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ety should sup­port par­ents in lim­it­ing the use of dig­i­tal de­vices for their chil­dren in many ways. While the adults can re­spon­si­bly man­age their screen time them­selves, young chil­dren will de­pend on oth­ers to make good choices for them by set­ting good ex­am­ples and lim­it­ing their screen time.</p>
    <p>It is not easy to jug­gle work with fam­ily time. But we know we can always ad­just. The best gift we can give to chil­dren is ac­tu­ally to spend our pre­cious time in­ter­act­ing with them in­stead of us­ing a life­less com­puter screen to re­place our parental roles.</p>
