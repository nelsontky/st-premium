    <p>Sol­diers in the Sin­ga­pore Army are now us­ing im­proved hel­mets and bet­ter-fit­ting load-bear­ing sys­tems made up of a vest and belt to carry their mil­i­tary gear.</p>
    <p>For the first time, two vari­ants of the vest-belt sys­tem – en­hanced and stan­dard – were de­vel­oped to re­place the pre­vi­ous in­te­grated load-bear­ing vest, which has been in use since 2009.</p>
    <p>Since Jan­uary, full-time na­tional ser­vice­men, or NSFs, in com­bat units like the com­man­dos, guards and in­fantry have been is­sued with the en­hanced ver­sion of the vest­belt sys­tem that is more cus­tomis­able and er­gonomic.</p>
    <p>It is also made to al­low bet­ter heat dis­si­pa­tion, with the aim of boost­ing sol­diers’ com­bat ef­fec­tive­ness.</p>
    <p>All other NSFs, such as those in com­bat sup­port or com­bat ser­vice sup­port vo­ca­tions, will be is­sued the stan­dard ver­sion from next year.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment comes as the army marks its 55th an­niver­sary this month since the pass­ing of the Sin­ga­pore Army Bill in Par­lia­ment in De­cem­ber 1965.</p>
    <p>The new hel­met and vest-belt sys­tem were shown to the press at Se­larang Camp in Loyang re­cently.</p>
    <p>The new sys­tem al­lows sol­diers to carry the mil­i­tary gear they need when train­ing out­field, such as their wa­ter bot­tle, am­mu­ni­tion or com­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Both types have a belt com­po­nent with a buckle, and straps that go over the shoul­ders. The belt, in­tended to be worn on the hips to re­duce shoul­der strain, is worn sep­a­rately from the vest, which cov­ers the torso area.</p>
    <p>Both types also fea­ture mul­ti­ple points of ad­just­ment to help en­sure a bet­ter fit. The en­hanced ver­sion also in­cludes a re­mov­able body ar­mour car­rier.</p>
    <p>Since July last year, re­cruits have been is­sued with the belt for train­ing. When they go to other units for fur­ther train­ing, they will be given ei­ther the en­hanced or stan­dard vest, de­pend­ing on their unit.</p>
    <p>The De­fence Min­istry said the new vest-belt sys­tems are made from a strong yet light­weight ma­te­rial that of­fers bet­ter com­fort and im­proves heat dis­si­pa­tion by about 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>The new hel­met, which was rolled out from Oc­to­ber last year, is about 10 per cent lighter than the pre­vi­ous one. Its high-cut de­sign al­lows bet­ter com­pat­i­bil­ity with other equip­ment worn on the head, such as ear muf­flers, com­mu­ni­ca­tion head­sets and night-vi­sion de­vices.</p>
    <p>It also has an ad­justable pad­ding sys­tem for a more com­fort­able fit.</p>
    <p>Lieu­tenant-Colonel Ho Chee Leong, head of the Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence for Sol­dier Per­for­mance (CESP), said the new equip­ment pro­vides sol­diers with bet­ter com­fort and fit, and more im­por­tantly, helps make them more ef­fec­tive in com­bat.</p>
    <p>The mod­u­lar de­sign of the equip­ment also al­lows sol­diers to cus­tomise it based on their mis­sion pro­files, so that they do not have to wear the full con­fig­u­ra­tion all the time, which helps re­duce heat strain, he added.</p>
    <p>A raft of agen­cies – such as the army’s in­fantry and sup­ply head­quar­ters, CESP, the De­fence Science and Tech­nol­ogy Agency, DSO Na­tional Lab­o­ra­to­ries and ST Lo­gis­tics – worked to­gether to eval­u­ate the en­hanced per­sonal equip­ment, which had been un­der devel­op­ment since 2016.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, there are no plans to equip op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men with the new hel­mets or vest-belt sys­tems. How­ever, some ar­tillery units will re­ceive the new hel­met be­cause it of­fers bet­ter com­pat­i­bil­ity with the ear pro­tec­tion equip­ment they use.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cer Cadet Ajey Jeyaku­mar, 20, who has been us­ing the new hel­met since June, said he was able to ad­just the in­side pad­ding to make the hel­met fit bet­ter.</p>
    <p>He said: “It’s good be­cause dur­ing long mis­sions, I have to wear my hel­met for long pe­ri­ods of time and still stay com­fort­able.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">The Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore Army&#x2019;s new load-bear&#xAD;ing sys&#xAD;tem (LBS) con&#xAD;sists of a vest and belt, which are sep&#xAD;a&#xAD;rate from each other (far left). The vest is se&#xAD;cured with a clip mech&#xAD;a&#xAD;nism (far left, be&#xAD;low). The LBS has two vari&#xAD;ants &#x2013; an en&#xAD;hanced ver&#xAD;sion is&#xAD;sued to full-time na&#xAD;tional ser&#xAD;vice&#xAD;men in com&#xAD;bat units since Jan&#xAD;uary, and a stan&#xAD;dard ver&#xAD;sion (left) that will be is&#xAD;sued to all other full-time na&#xAD;tional ser&#xAD;vice&#xAD;men from next year.</p>
