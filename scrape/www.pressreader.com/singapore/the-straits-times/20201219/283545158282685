    <p>PARIS • The Miche­lin Guide’s restaurant in­spec­tors had a trick­ier task than usual find­ing their note­wor­thy chefs of the year, rush­ing to get a seat at top ta­bles af­ter coro­n­avirus lock­downs forced ea­ter­ies to close for ex­tended pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>Revered as the go-to pub­li­ca­tion for gas­tron­omy, the Miche­lin Guide is on track to re­veal its top French picks next month, af­ter al­ready re­leas­ing some list­ings else­where, in­clud­ing in Spain and Ja­pan, said Mr Gwen­dal Poul­len­nec, its in­ter­na­tional di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>“As soon as restau­rants re­opened, the in­spec­tors were the first on the scene,” he said. They had to adapt in some cases, like when a restaurant needed a few days to op­er­ate nor­mally, and re­turned to fully ap­pre­ci­ate the of­fer, he added.</p>
    <p>Known for their ex­act­ing stan­dards, the Miche­lin in­spec­tors’ choices can be con­tro­ver­sial, with some chefs fight­ing back in the past af­ter los­ing stars.</p>
    <p>Some 3,236 restau­rants glob­ally now carry Miche­lin stars, up from 3,093 at the start of last year.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of restaurant re­view­ers work­ing for the guide is kept se­cret, although Miche­lin has dis­closed that peo­ple from 15 na­tion­al­i­ties work as in­spec­tors.</p>
    <p>This year, the guide, first pub­lished in 1900, wanted to press ahead as a means of pay­ing trib­ute to one of the in­dus­tries hard­est hit by coro­n­avirus mea­sures world­wide, Mr Poul­len­nec said.</p>
    <p>In France, seen by many as the stan­dard-bearer for fine din­ing, restau­rants may re­open only on</p>
    <p>Jan 20 at the ear­li­est, af­ter be­ing forced to shut since the end of Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The Miche­lin Guide has had to in­no­vate, too, and has tried to fo­ment an online fol­low­ing by pub­lish­ing recipes of chefs.</p>
    <p>For the first time this year, it has be­gun to list re­cip­i­ents of a “green star” – recog­nis­ing 164 chefs world­wide who em­pha­sise sea­sonal cook­ing and use of lo­cal sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>The French Miche­lin stars will be re­vealed on Jan 18.</p>
