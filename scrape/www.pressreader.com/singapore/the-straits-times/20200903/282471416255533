    <p>•</p>
    <p>BARCELONA It will be dif­fi­cult for Lionel Messi to re­main at Barcelona af­ter he made pub­lic his de­sire to leave the La Liga club, his fa­ther and agent Jorge said yes­ter­day as he flew into Spain on a pri­vate jet to ne­go­ti­ate his son’s fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Span­ish media, a meet­ing with Barca pres­i­dent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu has been ar­ranged al­though a spokesman for the club de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>The six-time World Player of the Year in­sists he has a clause in his con­tract that al­lows him to leave on a free trans­fer – a claim dis­puted by Barcelona and the Span­ish league, who say the cap­tain can only leave if a ri­val club is will­ing to pay his €700 mil­lion (S$1.13 bil­lion) buy­out clause.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know, I know noth­ing,” Jorge told lo­cal TV chan­nel Cu­a­tro when asked if the 33-year-old would leave the only club he has played for pro­fes­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>But when pressed if it would be hard for the Ar­gen­tinian for­ward to re­main, he replied “yes” and when asked how he saw Messi’s fu­ture at the Nou Camp, he said “dif­fi­cult, dif­fi­cult”.</p>
    <p>He, how­ever, dodged ques­tions on whether Manch­ester City would be a good op­tion for his son.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know, there’s noth­ing yet,” Jorge said, adding there had been no dis­cus­sions with the Premier League side.</p>
    <p>Given Messi’s mam­moth wages at a re­ported €1 mil­lion a week, only the Mid­dle East-backed clubs like City and French cham­pi­ons Paris Saint-Ger­main are seen as be­ing able to fi­nance a move for him.</p>
    <p>The shortlist of po­ten­tial suit­ors grew smaller on Tues­day af­ter Serie</p>
    <p>A side In­ter Mi­lan ruled them­selves out of the run­ning, say­ing “our re­al­ity is a sen­si­ble trans­fer mar­ket”.</p>
    <p>Messi mov­ing to City or PSG would in­stantly in­stall them as Cham­pi­ons League favourites, with both sides des­per­ate to win the sole hon­our miss­ing from their tro­phy cab­i­net.</p>
    <p>The Eti­had, how­ever, ap­pears to be a more en­tic­ing route to take as it would al­low him to link up with his for­mer Barca coach Pep Guardi­ola, with the pair win­ning two Cham­pi­ons League and three La Liga ti­tles together.</p>
    <p>Messi did not show up on Mon­day for the first train­ing ses­sion of the new term un­der coach Ron­ald</p>

    <p>Prat air­port yes­ter­day. He said he has not been in dis­cus­sions with Premier League club Manch­ester City.</p>
    <p>Koe­man, who has al­ready started his clear-out at the club.</p>
    <p>Croa­t­ian mid­fielder Ivan Rakitic was the first player to be moved on Tues­day, join­ing Sevilla for an ini­tial €1.5 mil­lion and at his un­veil­ing yes­ter­day, the 32-year-old urged his for­mer team­mate to think care­fully about whether leav­ing the Cata­lan gi­ants was the wis­est thing to do.</p>
    <p>“The first op­tion and the best op­tion for all play­ers is al­ways Barca,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Then, each player has to make their de­ci­sion. For me, the first op­tion would al­ways be to be at Barca. Ev­ery player has to do his own anal­y­sis and I be­lieved it was my mo­ment. What Messi and other play­ers are go­ing to do, I don’t know.”</p>
    <p>Barca are com­ing off the back of their first tro­phy­less sea­son in 12 years and their fail­ure to win the Cham­pi­ons League since 2015 has trig­gered Messi’s trans­fer re­quest.</p>
    <p>But Rakitic does not nec­es­sar­ily feel his for­mer side are on a down­ward slide, say­ing: “I’ve not said any­thing about the end of a cy­cle, only that I al­ways an­a­lyse ev­ery­thing and the sit­u­a­tion has ar­rived to start think­ing in an­other way.</p>
    <p>“It’s not the end of an era. Af­ter six years, it wasn’t easy for me to leave. I’m re­ally grate­ful for ev­ery de­tail.”</p>
    <p>The first op­tion and the best op­tion for all play­ers is al­ways Barca.</p>
