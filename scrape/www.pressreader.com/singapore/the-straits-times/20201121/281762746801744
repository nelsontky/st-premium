    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK The surge i n new Covid-19 in­fec­tions is driv­ing a fresh wave of re­stric­tions in cities and coun­ties across the United States.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia’s “emer­gency brake”, Oregon’s “freeze”, Philadel­phia’s “safer at home” and Min­nesota’s “dial back” are among a new patch­work of rules adopted that are much less strict and far more nar­row than mea­sures im­posed to stop the spread of the virus in the spring.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion does not sup­port an­other lock­down or school clo­sures, Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence said on Thurs­day dur­ing a coro­n­avirus task force brief­ing, in which he also high­lighted ris­ing pos­i­tiv­ity rates for coro­n­avirus tests ad­min­is­tered across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of pa­tients hos­pi­talised with Covid-19 in the US has jumped nearly 50 per cent in the last two weeks as Amer­i­cans face a po­ten­tially grim win­ter and hol­i­day sea­son.</p>
    <p>Nearly 79,000 peo­ple were be­ing treated for the dis­ease in hos­pi­tals across the coun­try on Thurs­day, a Reuters tally showed, the most at any time dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials have warned that the sharp rise in hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions could worsen if Amer­i­cans do not limit their Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day cel­e­bra­tions to small, sin­gle­house­hold gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>The US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion is­sued a “strong rec­om­men­da­tion” on Thurs­day that Amer­i­cans re­frain from trav­el­ling for the hol­i­day, which will be cel­e­brated next Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia’s gover­nor on Thurs­day im­posed a cur­few on so­cial gath­er­ings and other non-es­sen­tial ac­tiv­i­ties in one of the most in­tru­sive of the re­stric­tions be­ing or­dered across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The stay-at-home or­der will go into ef­fect from 10pm un­til 5am each day – start­ing tonight and end­ing on the morn­ing of Dec 21 – and it will cover 41 of Cal­i­for­nia’s 58 coun­ties and the vast ma­jor­ity of its pop­u­la­tion, said Gover­nor Gavin New­som.</p>
    <p>“The virus is spread­ing at a pace we haven’t seen since the start of this pan­demic, and the next sev­eral days and weeks will be crit­i­cal to stop the surge,” Mr New­som, a Demo­crat, said in a state­ment an­nounc­ing the mea­sure a week be­fore the Thanks­giv­ing hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>In Cal­i­for­nia, the re­stric­tion essen­tially marks a re­turn to the first-in-the-na­tion, statewide stay­home or­der that Mr New­som im­posed in March, ex­cept it ap­plies only dur­ing the des­ig­nated cur­few hours rather than round the clock.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar 10pm-to-5am cur­few or­der was is­sued on Thurs­day in Ohio and will re­main in ef­fect for the next 21 days, Gover­nor Mike DeWine, a Repub­li­can, an­nounced sep­a­rately.</p>
    <p>As in Cal­i­for­nia, the Ohio cur­few would not pro­hibit gro­cery stores from re­main­ing open past 10pm, or keep restau­rants from stay­ing open late for take­out orders. In­di­vid­u­als would like­wise be per­mit­ted to ven­ture out for food, med­i­cal care or other ne­ces­si­ties, as well as to take a jog or walk a dog.</p>
    <p>Rhode Is­land Gover­nor Gina Rai­mondo on Thurs­day an­nounced a two-week “pause” pe­riod start­ing Nov 30 that will halt in-per­son col­lege classes, close bars and limit ca­pac­ity at restau­rants and houses of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in Oregon closed of­fices to the pub­lic and are lim­it­ing the num­ber of peo­ple in gro­cery stores at a time.</p>
    <p>Michi­gan be­gan a three-week shut­down on Wed­nes­day that closed gyms, high schools, col­leges and en­ter­tain­ment venues.</p>
    <p>Min­nesota, one of sev­eral Mid­west states dogged by soar­ing in­fec­tion rates per capita, or­dered a shut­down of restau­rants, bars, fit­ness cen­tres and en­ter­tain­ment venues from yes­ter­day un­til at least Dec 18, as the state’s hos­pi­tal in­ten­sive care units are stretched to ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>In the na­tion’s cap­i­tal, Wash­ing­ton DC, the Smith­so­nian In­sti­tu­tion an­nounced it would close its museums and the Na­tional Zoo be­gin­ning next Mon­day, with no set re­open­ing date.</p>
    <p>In Mary­land, which re­ported a record 2,910 new cases in a 24-hour pe­riod on Thurs­day, the Bal­ti­more pub­lic school district said it would halt in-per­son learn­ing the week af­ter Thanks­giv­ing to avoid ex­ac­er­bat­ing the virus spread that may oc­cur over the hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>Look­ing fur­ther ahead, Penn­syl­va­nia of­fi­cials an­nounced that crowds will not be per­mit­ted to at­tend an­nual Ground­hog Day fes­tiv­i­ties in Punx­sutawney.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, New York City’s pub­lic school sys­tem, the na­tion’s largest, halted in-class in­struc­tion due to ris­ing in­fec­tion rates just weeks af­ter al­low­ing its 1.1 mil­lion stu­dents back into class­rooms on a part-time ba­sis.</p>
