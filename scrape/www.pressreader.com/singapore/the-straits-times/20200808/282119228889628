    <p>In early 2018, prop­erty agent Vin­cent Jiang helped a home owner rent her flat near Tiong Bahru to a man who claimed to be an em­ployer seek­ing ac­com­mo­da­tion for work­ers of his paint­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>The prospec­tive ten­ant pro­vided his Sin­ga­pore iden­tity card (IC) along with pic­tures of the ICs of his three em­ploy­ees who would be oc­cu­py­ing the flat. The trio were Sin­ga­porean men in their 50s.</p>
    <p>The ten­ancy agree­ment was signed, but four months later, a neigh­bour com­plained to the land­lord that men were con­tin­u­ally stream­ing into the unit.</p>
    <p>The land­lord and Mr Jiang fixed a date with the ten­ants to check on the unit, but when they ar­rived, noth­ing seemed amiss.</p>
    <p>When the neigh­bour com­plained again, the land­lord did a sur­prise check and found five women who spoke a for­eign lan­guage in the flat. The three men were nowhere to be seen. Shocked, she sent the women pack­ing. Her ten­ants, who had been pay­ing rent reg­u­larly, were un­con­tactable.</p>
    <p>Mr Jiang told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that he and the land­lord sus­pected the flat had been used for vice ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The episode was a close call for the land­lord, as un­der harsher laws that took ef­fect yes­ter­day, she could have been fined and even jailed had she not checked on and evicted her ten­ants.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties hope home own­ers will help to en­sure their homes are not be­ing used as broth­els.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new laws, home own­ers or ten­ants who rent or sub­let their premises for use as a brothel are crim­i­nally li­able, un­less they can show they had no knowl­edge and could not have, with rea­son­able dili­gence, as­cer­tained the place was to be used for such a pur­pose.</p>
    <p>Land­lords are re­quired to ex­er­cise “rea­son­able dili­gence” by do­ing iden­tity checks of prospec­tive ten­ants or sub-ten­ants through face-to-face in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>If they are over­seas, they should en­gage an agent to con­duct in­ter­views on their be­half, said the Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) on Thursday. MHA also said it is part­ner­ing the Coun­cil for Es­tate Agen­cies, prop­erty agen­cies and agents to as­sist and ad­vise prop­erty own­ers and ten­ants on con­duct­ing due-dili­gence checks.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty agent M. Dhaneswery said most land­lords would not turn up unan­nounced at their rented flats, un­less there is an emer­gency.</p>
    <p>“As for agents, it is def­i­nitely not prac­ti­cal to be vis­it­ing so many units pe­ri­od­i­cally,” she added.</p>
    <p>The new stricter laws and stiffer penal­ties were put in place to stem the ris­ing trend of vice in the heart­land of Sin­ga­pore. Said MHA: “The changes to the Women’s Char­ter strengthen the laws against on­line vice, and en­hance the po­lice’s levers against vice syn­di­cates. These changes will help to stem an in­creas­ing trend of vice in the heart­land.”</p>
    <p>The Women’s Char­ter amend­ments, passed in Par­lia­ment on Nov 4 last year, were prompted by a ris­ing trend of women ar­rested for vice be­ing in­volved in on­line syn­di­cates as well.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial fig­ures show that in 2015, 16 per cent of women nabbed for vice were in­volved with on­line syn­di­cates. It rose to 55 per cent in 2018.</p>
    <p>Also, from 2015 to 2018, seven in 10 for­eign women ar­rested for ad­ver­tis­ing their ser­vices on­line were pro­vid­ing sex­ual ser­vices in res­i­den­tial es­tates.</p>
    <p>To tackle the ris­ing trend of on­line vice ac­tiv­i­ties, the au­thor­i­ties can now take more de­ci­sive ac­tion against those who use re­mote com­mu­ni­ca­tion ser­vices to of­fer sex­ual ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore, even if the web­sites used are hosted over­seas.</p>
    <p>With the en­hanced penal­ties, the max­i­mum jail term for pros­ti­tu­tion­re­lated crimes is five years for first­time of­fend­ers, up from three years. For re­peat of­fend­ers, the max­i­mum is seven years, up from five.</p>
    <p>For more se­vere of­fences, first­time of­fend­ers could be jailed for up to seven years, while the max­i­mum for re­peat of­fend­ers re­mains at 10 years. For fines, the max­i­mum fine for a first of­fence has been raised to $100,000, and in­creased to $150,000 for re­peat of­fend­ers.</p>
