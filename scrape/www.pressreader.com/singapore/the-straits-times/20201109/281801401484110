    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Petronas, Malaysia’s state-owned en­ergy gi­ant, is ex­pected to pay the re­source-rich state of Sabah RM1.25 bil­lion (S$408 mil­lion) in sales tax next year.</p>
    <p>Sabah Deputy Chief Min­is­ter Jef­frey Kitin­gan said Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin had agreed for the state to col­lect the 5 per cent tax from Petronas next year, Ber­nama news agency re­ported late on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Sabah and neigh­bour­ing Sarawak state to­gether hold much of the na­tion’s oil and gas re­serves, and have long asked for more pay­ments from Petronas, the sole man­ager of the coun­try’s en­ergy re­serves.</p>
    <p>Petronas suf­fered its first loss in nearly five years in the sec­ond quar­ter due to a coro­n­avirus-driven slump in de­mand and oil prices. The pay­ments could fur­ther hurt its fi­nances.</p>
    <p>The firm had fought Sarawak’s de­mand for sales tax in court but in Septem­ber, it paid the state RM2.96 bil­lion in taxes, as part of an un­ex­pected set­tle­ment deal.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said the pay­ment could en­cour­age other states to make sim­i­lar de­mands.</p>
    <p>Sarawak’s Chief Min­is­ter Abang Jo­hari Openg is said to be a close po­lit­i­cal ally of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din. Sources have said he is open to giv­ing more oil money to the state.</p>
    <p>But for­mer Petronas chief ex­ec­u­tive Wan Zulk­i­flee Wan Arif­fin had op­posed the set­tle­ment and re­signed in June.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s agree­ment for Petronas to pay Sabah comes after his rul­ing coali­tion wres­tled con­trol of the state from the op­po­si­tion in a state election in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Petronas is a sig­nif­i­cant source of rev­enue for the fed­eral govern­ment and a hit to its fi­nances could also af­fect the an­nual div­i­dend it pays to the govern­ment, which is its sole share­holder.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is set to pay RM34 bil­lion in div­i­dend this year and RM18 bil­lion next year.</p>
