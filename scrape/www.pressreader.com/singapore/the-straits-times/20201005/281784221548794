    <p>KOTA KINABALU • Hit hard by coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, Malaysia’s Sabah yes­ter­day im­posed strict con­di­tions be­fore al­low­ing those out­side from en­ter­ing the state.</p>
    <p>The Sabah Im­mi­gra­tion De­part­ment said non-Saba­hans, in­clud­ing for­eign na­tion­als, who work in es­sen­tial ser­vices must have valid im­mi­gra­tion passes that it had is­sued be­fore en­ter­ing Malaysia’s sec­ond-big­gest state by land size.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers must first ob­tain spe­cial per­mits prior to en­ter­ing the state.</p>
    <p>“This reg­u­la­tion will be in ef­fect un­til Oct 16,” said the de­part­ment. “Malaysian per­ma­nent res­i­dents are also re­quired to ob­tain the spe­cial per­mit be­fore en­ter­ing the state.”</p>
    <p>Saba­hans who want to re­turn to the state must have the “H” code on their Malaysian iden­tity cards, called MyKad, to sig­nify they are res­i­dents of the state.</p>
    <p>Most of the new cases in re­cent weeks were recorded in Sabah and Kedah states.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin last Satur­day said the surge in Sabah was caused by a num­ber of il­le­gal mi­grants en­ter­ing the state with­out au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Sabah shares its land bor­der with Malaysia’s Sarawak state and In­done­sia’s North Kal­i­man­tan prov­ince, and also shares sea bor­ders with the south­ern Philip­pines and In­done­sia’s Kal­i­man­tan and Su­lawesi prov­inces.</p>
    <p>In Sabah’s case, the surge in cases was wors­ened by two weeks of po­lit­i­cal cam­paign­ing be­fore the Sept 26 state polls.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment im­posed a ban on in­ter-district travel for two weeks among Sabah’s 27 dis­tricts from Satur­day. Gen­er­ally, only those work­ing in es­sen­tial ser­vices such as medicine, se­cu­rity and food sup­plies are al­lowed to travel be­tween dis­tricts.</p>
    <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day recorded 293 new Covid-19 in­fec­tions, slightly lower than 317 cases last Satur­day, which was a record high since the pan­demic hit the coun­try in March.</p>
