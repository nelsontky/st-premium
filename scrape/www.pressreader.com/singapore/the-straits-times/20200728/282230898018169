    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain’s Andy Mur­ray is still feel­ing “ap­pre­hen­sive” about trav­el­ling to New York for the US Open amid the Covid-19 pan­demic but the former world No. 1 is men­tally pre­par­ing for the Grand Slam.</p>
    <p>The United States has the high­est num­ber of con­firmed Covid-19 cases in the world and re­ported over 50,000 cases daily dur­ing the last seven days.</p>
    <p>The US Open, which is due to start on Aug 31, will be held with­out spec­ta­tors, and or­gan­is­ers are plan­ning to set up a strict bio-se­cu­rity “bub­ble” around the tour­na­ment to mit­i­gate the risk of con­tract­ing the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“Four or five weeks ago, we were pretty scep­ti­cal about it,” Mur­ray, 33, told the Bri­tish me­dia. “But men­tally at some stage you need to start pre­par­ing and plan­ning for that.</p>
    <p>“If it wasn’t hap­pen­ing, my sched­ule for prac­tis­ing, my re­hab, would all be a bit dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“Men­tally I’m plan­ning for it to go ahead.”</p>
    <p>The three-time Grand Slam win­ner, who made his Ma­jor break­through at Flush­ing Mead­ows in 2012, re­turned from a sev­en­month in­jury lay­off last month at a char­ity event or­gan­ised by his older brother Jamie, 34.</p>
    <p>“The is­sue for us is the travel, so we’ll prob­a­bly be a bit ap­pre­hen­sive get­ting over there,” said Mur­ray. “Hope­fully the US Open can go ahead... but if not, I’m also OK with that. It’s not like I’m say­ing it must go ahead.</p>
    <p>“So long as it’s safe for the play­ers then we need to try to get back to com­pet­ing.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral lead­ing fig­ures have cast doubts over the US Open, in­clud­ing world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic, who ear­lier this month said he was un­de­cided over whether to travel for the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>The ATP and WTA Tours have been sus­pended since March.</p>
    <p>Ten­nis chiefs last week can­celled the Citi Open in Wash­ing­ton DC due to mark the re­sump­tion of the men’s ten­nis sea­son over “con­tin­ued un­cer­tain­ties”.</p>
