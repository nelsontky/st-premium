    <p>Artist Suzann Vic­tor, 60, was at an Aus­tralian char­ity shop last year when she stum­bled on some post­cards from colo­nial-era Java.</p>
    <p>The women in the pho­tos were un­smil­ing, their glares al­most de­fi­ant – at odds with the pli­ant na­ture of their staged poses.</p>
    <p>The up­shot of this en­counter is Un­equal In­no­cence (2020), the lat­est work in Vic­tor’s Len­sPaint­ing se­ries to be pub­licly shown.</p>
    <p>Colo­nial-era im­ages of Asian girls and women have been as­sem­bled in a col­lage on a hand-painted cir­cu­lar can­vas, cov­ered by a ve­neer of over­lap­ping cir­cu­lar mag­ni­fy­ing lenses. As the viewer steps side­ways, burnt gaps in the lenses of­fer glimpses of the faces un­der­neath.</p>
    <p>The idea, Vic­tor says, is to “carve back the dig­nity of sub­ju­gated hu­man sub­jects who were made to bare them­selves be­fore the allsee­ing eye of the im­pe­ri­al­ist­wielded cam­era”.</p>
    <p>“We all are en­ti­tled to the right to not be seen,” adds the Sin­ga­pore­born artist.</p>
    <p>Un­equal In­no­cence can now be viewed at Ga­jah Gallery as part of the group show, (Re)Imag­in­ing The Image: Con­tem­po­rary Artists In Asia Con­verse With Pho­tog­ra­phy. The ex­hi­bi­tion runs till Oct 11 and fea­tures eight prom­i­nent artists.</p>
    <p>One of them is Bali-based Mangu Pu­tra, who is pre­sent­ing two hy­per­re­al­ist works, Vick­ers Car­den (2014) and Mount Batur (2020). The for­mer, a dark oil and acrylic on can­vas piece, was in­spired by a post-World War II photo of In­done­sian sol­diers in front of a Vick­er­sCar­den-Loyd tank.</p>
    <p>Other works are self-re­flex­ive, if not self-dep­re­cat­ing.</p>
    <p>Tian­jin-born artist Li Jin, for ex­am­ple, ap­pears as a strange tourist in his ink on pa­per se­ries, Im­pres­sions Of Bali (2017).</p>
    <p>Ash­ley Bick­er­ton, con­scious of his po­si­tion as a West­ern man liv­ing in Bali, has a mixed me­dia on jute piece where a blue, alien-like man paints a wo­man bear­ing trop­i­cal flow­ers. Then there is West Jav­aborn artist Oc­tora, who has restaged var­i­ous im­ages of Ba­li­nese women with her­self as the model.</p>
    <p>Also on dis­play are an­tique pho­tos of South-east Asian peo­ple in the 19th and 20th cen­turies.</p>
    <p>One of the staged im­ages, taken by Kas­sian Cephas, the first indige­nous per­son from In­done­sia to be­come a pro­fes­sional pho­tog­ra­pher, shows one Ja­vanese wo­man de­lous­ing an­other. “One man’s death is an­other man’s bread”, reads an enig­matic Dutch in­scrip­tion on the back of the photo.</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion’s cu­ra­tor, Mani­l­abased Ni­cole So­ri­ano, says: “What was the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the pho­tog­ra­pher and the sub­ject? What were the things she may not have con­sented to, and why was her gaze like that? It is very un­set­tling.”</p>
    <p>Ms So­ri­ano is ex­cited by re­cent schol­ar­ship on pho­tog­ra­phy, such as Zhuang Wu­bin’s 2016 survey of pho­tog­ra­phy in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>She also notes that there have been a num­ber of shows in re­cent years ex­plor­ing the topic – such as the Sin­ga­pore Art Mu­seum’s Af­ter­im­age: Con­tem­po­rary Pho­tog­ra­phy From South­east Asia (2014); and the Na­tional Gallery of Aus­tralia’s Gar­den Of The East (2014), which looked at pho­tog­ra­phy in In­done­sia from the 1850s to 1940s.</p>
    <p>She says the chal­lenges of cu­rat­ing a show like this one – for a com­mer­cial art gallery, no less – in­clude nav­i­gat­ing the eth­i­cal is­sues of pho­tog­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>“How do I look at these im­ages and write about them, in a way that isn’t voyeuris­tic or ex­ploita­tive? I re­ally wres­tled with that.”</p>
    <p>The ex­hi­bi­tion en­gages with colo­nial pho­tog­ra­phy and seeks to undo the other­ing gaze, show­ing how pho­to­graphs can be used to lib­er­ate.</p>
    <p>She adds: “It’s an at­tempt, a process. It’s an on­go­ing en­gage­ment that con­tin­u­ally needs to be ques­tioned and reimag­ined.”</p>
