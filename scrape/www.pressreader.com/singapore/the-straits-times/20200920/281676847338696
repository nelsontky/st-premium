    <p>Paris, where the virus has been cir­cu­lat­ing more quickly than else­where, has not banned gath­er­ings of more than 10 peo­ple but the po­lice have strongly ad­vised against pri­vate gath­er­ings of more than that num­ber. The most af­fected re­gions and cities in France have tight­ened reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>France re­ported 13,215 new con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases over the past 24 hours, a new record since the start of the epi­demic, while the daily death toll jumped to a four-month high.</p>
    <p>The new cases pushed the cu­mu­la­tive to­tal to 428,696 as the seven-day mov­ing av­er­age of daily new in­fec­tions rose to more than 9,300, com­pared to a low of 272 at the end of May, two weeks af­ter lock­down was lifted.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­ol­o­gists blame the in­crease on a com­bi­na­tion of faster cir­cu­la­tion of the virus and a six­fold in­crease in test­ing since the gov­ern­ment made it free.</p>
    <p>The health min­istry re­ported that the to­tal num­ber of deaths from Covid-19 in­creased by 154 to 31,249, a four-month high and triple the lev­els of the past week.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, the min­istry re­ported that the toll had in­creased by 123, but then up­dated that to 154.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties at­trib­uted the sud­den jump to pre­vi­ously un­re­ported cases in one hospi­tal lo­cated in Es­sonne, about 55km south of Paris.</p>
    <p>As the in­fec­tion rate in­creases daily, the most af­fected re­gions and cities in France have tight­ened reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The city of Nice on the French Riviera will ban gath­er­ings of more than 10 peo­ple in pub­lic spa­ces and force bars to close early af­ter Mar­seille and Bordeaux in­tro­duced sim­i­lar mea­sures last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Paris, where the virus has also been cir­cu­lat­ing more quickly than else­where, has not banned gath­er­ings of more than 10 peo­ple but the po­lice pre­fec­ture said on Fri­day that it strongly ad­vised against pri­vate gath­er­ings of more than that num­ber.</p>
    <p>Hospi­tal data was rel­a­tively stable on Fri­day, with the to­tal num­ber of peo­ple in hospi­tal with Covid-19 down by 25 to 5,819 and the num­ber of peo­ple in in­ten­sive care up by 27 to 800.</p>
    <p>The virus has also i nfected French Fi­nance Min­is­ter Bruno Le Maire, who said he tested pos­i­tive on Fri­day, mak­ing him the most se­nior of­fi­cial in the coun­try known to be in­fected.</p>
    <p>Mr Le Maire, who said he did not have any symp­toms, is self­iso­lat­ing at home and will re­main there for seven days, in ac­cor­dance with the lat­est rules.</p>
    <p>His case fol­lows that of Gu­atemala Pres­i­dent Ale­jan­dro Gi­ammat­tei last week, and ear­lier in the pan­demic those of Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son and Brazil­ian Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro, both of whom have re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>Mr Le Maire was an ad­vo­cate of get­ting the econ­omy go­ing again as fast as pos­si­ble. Af­ter the end of France’s lock­down, he posed for cam­eras drink­ing cof­fee at a pave­ment cafe on the first day of the re­open­ing of bars and restau­rants in June.</p>
    <p>His pos­i­tive test is a con­cern for other se­nior gov­ern­ment lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, he at­tended a Cabi­net meet­ing at the El­y­see Palace with Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron and other min­is­ters and met the man­age­ment of Suez later in the day.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day morn­ing, he hosted a meet­ing of France’s fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity coun­cil, which in­cludes the chiefs of mar­ket and bank­ing reg­u­la­tors and the gov­er­nor of the Bank of France, Mr Fran­cois Villeroy de Gal­hau.</p>
