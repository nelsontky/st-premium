    <p>All 1,000 places for an on­line we­bi­nar on Covid-19 to be hosted by The Straits Times to­day were snapped up within a day of the we­bi­nar’s an­nounce­ment, and more than 300 read­ers were on the wait­list as of last night.</p>
    <p>Suc­cess­ful reg­is­trants would have re­ceived an e-mail in­vi­ta­tion to join the we­bi­nar, which takes place at 12.30pm to­day on video­con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom.</p>
    <p>A video record­ing of the we­bi­nar will also be made avail­able to ev­ery­one on ST’s Face­book page and YouTube chan­nel at 7pm this evening.</p>
    <p>The we­bi­nar will ad­dress some of the burn­ing ques­tions on the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion. For in­stance, when Sin­ga­pore­ans can ex­pect to be able to go on hol­i­day again is one of the ques­tions read­ers sent to ST that will be posed to the pan­el­lists.</p>
    <p>Also on their minds is why the num­ber of daily new cases in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries con­tin­ues to be high de­spite the work­ers hav­ing un­der­gone sev­eral months of quar­an­tine and iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Read­ers have also asked about the ve­rac­ity of claims made on­line that breath­ing in heated air can help neu­tralise the coro­n­avirus in a per­son’s throat and lungs.</p>
    <p>The we­bi­nar panel con­sists of Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, who is dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health; Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases con­sul­tant at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal and chair of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s Global Out­break Alert and Re­sponse Net­work steer­ing com­mit­tee; and Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong, deputy di­rec­tor of the emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School, who is work­ing on Covid-19 treat­ments and vac­cines.</p>
    <p>ST’s se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik is the mod­er­a­tor for the dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>The we­bi­nar is be­ing or­gan­ised to ob­serve the six-month mark since Sin­ga­pore re­ported its first con­firmed case of Covid-19 on Jan 23. Glob­ally, there are now more than 15 mil­lion con­firmed cases and over 600,000 deaths. In Sin­ga­pore, the lat­est case tally as of last night stands at 48,744, with 27 deaths.</p>
