    <p>Two Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) of­fi­cers who had claimed trial over a rag­ging in­ci­dent in which a full-time na­tional ser­vice­man died two years ago are now fac­ing less se­ri­ous charges.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ken­neth Chong Chee Boon, 39, and Nazhan Mo­hamed Nazi, 42, were each charged with one count of per­form­ing a neg­li­gent act by fail­ing to pre­vent their sub­or­di­nates from car­ry­ing out the rag­ging ac­tiv­ity on May 13, 2018.</p>
    <p>Those con­victed of this of­fence can be jailed for up to three months and fined up to $1,500.</p>
    <p>The two men were orig­i­nally charged with in­ten­tion­ally aid­ing a group of SCDF ser­vice­men to cause griev­ous hurt to Cor­po­ral Kok Yuen Chin, 22, via a rash act en­dan­ger­ing hu­man life.</p>
    <p>Those con­victed of this of­fence can be jailed for up to four years and fined up to $10,000.</p>
    <p>The pair are ac­cused of fail­ing to pre­vent the group from pres­sur­ing Cor­po­ral Kok to en­ter a 12m-deep pump well at Tuas View Fire Sta­tion – a banned ac­tiv­ity known as “ko­lam” – to mark the im­pend­ing com­ple­tion of his na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Chong was com­man­der and Nazhan, deputy com­man­der, of the sta­tion at the time.</p>
    <p>Three SCDF reg­u­lars had ear­lier been con­victed and sen­tenced over their in­volve­ment in the tragedy. One of them – Muham­mad Nur Fatwa Mah­mood, 34 – was sen­tenced to a year and four weeks in jail, in Oc­to­ber 2018, af­ter he ad­mit­ted to the fa­tal push.</p>
    <p>In de­liv­er­ing his rea­sons for amend­ing the charge that Chong and Nazhan were fac­ing, Se­nior District Judge Ong Hian Sun noted yes­ter­day that it was Nur Fatwa who pushed Cor­po­ral Kok into the well that evening.</p>
    <p>He said that Chong and Nazhan were not present at the well, adding that the pair did not have the op­por­tu­nity to in­ter­vene or take pre­ven­tive ac­tion at the time.</p>
    <p>The judge, how­ever, stressed that there had been a “dere­lic­tion of duty” on the part of both men, and said Chong and Nazhan were obliged to en­sure Cor­po­ral Kok’s life was not en­dan­gered while he was on duty.</p>
    <p>Nazhan did not plead guilty to the amended charge yes­ter­day. Chong, how­ever, ad­mit­ted to it.</p>
    <p>In ear­lier sub­mis­sions, Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tors Ku­mare­san Go­hu­la­balan, Kelly Ho and Sheryl Yeo said that Chong and Nazhan had breached their le­gal obli­ga­tion by omit­ting to in­ter­fere even as they knew that the group of SCDF ser­vice­men were pres­sur­ing Cor­po­ral Kok to take part in the ko­lam rit­ual.</p>
    <p>They said that Chong turned back to his du­ties in the sta­tion’s watch room while Nazhan left the pump well area – where the rest of the ser­vice­men and Cor­po­ral Kok were – to re­turn to the sta­tion’s of­fice.</p>
    <p>But de­fence lawyers for Chong and Nazhan ar­gued in their re­spec­tive sub­mis­sions that the pros­e­cu­tion had not proven its case “be­yond rea­son­able doubt”.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee Pan Lee and Ms Low Chang Yong – who are rep­re­sent­ing Chong – said their client had trusted the ser­vice­men to pro­tect one other.</p>
    <p>Chong also be­lieved Cor­po­ral Kok would have en­tered the pump well only vol­un­tar­ily and on his own, which would have a “very low” risk of harm, they said.</p>
    <p>Nazhan’s de­fence lawyers, Mr Singa Ret­nam and Ms Josephine Lezu Costan, said their client had left the pump well area be­fore Cor­po­ral Kok was pushed and could not have “in­ten­tion­ally aided the com­mis­sion of the rash act”.</p>
    <p>Chong and Nazhan have been of­fered bail of $15,000 each and will be back in court on Aug 18.</p>
