    <p>Shares in Sin­ga­pore fell along­side those in most Asian eq­uity mar­kets yesterday, fol­low­ing a surge in global coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Op­ti­mism from hopes of a vac­cine and the Euro­pean Union re­cov­ery fund, which fu­elled Tues­day’s gains, was dented by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s com­ments on the grav­ity of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said the Covid-19 pan­demic in the United States will “get worse be­fore it gets bet­ter” as the coun­try reg­is­tered more than 140,000 deaths from the virus.</p>
    <p>OCBC In­vest­ment Re­search said US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo’s com­ments – that the US wants to build a global coali­tion to counter China – also weighed on the mar­kets; he ac­cused China of ex­ploit­ing the pan­demic to fur­ther its own in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times Index (STI) fell 34.92 points, or 1.3 per cent, to 2,594.53. De­clin­ers out­paced ad­vancers 314 to 163, as 1.55 bil­lion shares worth $1.15 bil­lion changed hands.</p>
    <p>None of the 30 STI con­stituents reg­is­tered gains for the day. Cap­i­taLand Com­mer­cial Trust, Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust, Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore and Maple­tree In­dus­trial Trust ended the day un­changed.</p>
    <p>At the bot­tom of the STI ta­ble were Dairy Farm In­ter­na­tional, which fell 3.4 per cent to US$4.26, and Singtel, which de­clined 2.4 per cent to $2.48.</p>
    <p>Thai Bev­er­age re­mained the most heav­ily traded counter, with more than 41 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands. Its shares fell 2.3 per cent to 64.5 cents, leav­ing the counter among the STI’s bot­tom three.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal lenders ended the day lower, fol­low­ing a DBS Group Re­search re­port after trad­ing hours on</p>
    <p>Tues­day that had said div­i­dend cuts by Sin­ga­pore banks may hap­pen “as early as” the up­com­ing pay­out to be an­nounced for the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>DBS fell 1.5 per cent to $21.08, UOB de­clined 1.4 per cent to $20.40, and OCBC Bank slipped 1.4 per cent to $9.80.</p>
    <p>Else­where in the re­gion, South­east Asian stock mar­kets wa­vered through the ses­sion, with in­vestors on edge as US law­mak­ers strug­gled to agree on terms for more fis­cal sup­port for the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong stocks fell the most in nearly six weeks, as signs of es­ca­lat­ing Sino-US ten­sions weighed on mar­ket sen­ti­ment. At the close of trade, the Hang Seng index was down 2.25 per cent at 25,057.94, its big­gest fall since June 11.</p>
