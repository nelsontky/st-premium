    <p>Lo­cal food man­u­fac­turer Whye Kee Food­stuff was fined $17,700 for il­le­gal dis­charge of trade ef­flu­ent, or liq­uid waste cre­ated by busi­nesses, into pub­lic sew­ers on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>Na­tional wa­ter agency PUB dis­cov­ered the of­fences dur­ing site in­spec­tions of Whye Kee’s premises in Tai Seng Av­enue be­tween Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber last year.</p>
    <p>The liq­uid waste sam­ple col­lected dur­ing one of the in­spec­tions was found to have ex­ceeded al­low­able lim­its by more than 120 times.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions showed the com­pany, which man­u­fac­tures rice prod­ucts, had failed to put mea­sures in place to pre­vent ex­ces­sive food waste gen­er­ated from its man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­cesses from go­ing into the sew­ers.</p>
    <p>It was fined last month for the il­le­gal dis­charge af­ter hav­ing been fined $14,400 for sim­i­lar of­fences in May last year.</p>
    <p>PUB said yes­ter­day in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times: “Whye Kee could have put in strain­ers to re­move the scum from the food man­u­fac­tur­ing ac­tiv­i­ties... or col­lected the food waste separately for dis­posal by gen­eral waste col­lec­tors.”</p>
    <p>The firm also did not pre-treat its waste to meet dis­charge lim­its.</p>
    <p>PUB added that it has from May 4 this year re­voked ap­proval for Whye Kee to dis­charge its liq­uid waste into sew­ers, and the com­pany has to en­gage waste col­lec­tors to col­lect its waste wa­ter for off-site dis­posal.</p>
    <p>The agency said ex­ces­sive lev­els of these sub­stances in the sewage can up­set wa­ter treat­ment pro­cesses at wa­ter recla­ma­tion plants and dis­rupt Ne­wa­ter pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause high con­cen­tra­tions of these sub­stances are toxic to mi­cro-or­gan­isms which recla­ma­tion plants rely on to treat used wa­ter.</p>
    <p>PUB said it took en­force­ment ac­tion against 30 com­pa­nies last year for il­le­gal dis­charge of liq­uid waste into pub­lic sew­ers.</p>
    <p>Most of the of­fend­ers were man­u­fac­tur­ing com­pa­nies from the pack­ag­ing, chem­i­cal and elec­tron­ics sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Those who il­le­gally dis­charge liq­uid waste con­tain­ing chem­i­cal sub­stances ex­ceed­ing al­low­able lim­its can be fined be­tween $5,000 and $15,000 for each of­fence.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor of PUB’s wa­ter recla­ma­tion net­work Mau­rice Neo said the agency will not hes­i­tate to pros­e­cute com­pa­nies which dis­re­gard these reg­u­la­tions, and will step up the fre­quency of in­spec­tions at the premises of re­peat of­fend­ers.</p>
