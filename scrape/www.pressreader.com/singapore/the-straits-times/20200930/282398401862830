    <p>The Ap­ple Watch Series 6 looks like its pre­de­ces­sor, the Series 5, which also looks like the Series 4. You get the same rec­tan­gu­lar watch case with a crown and but­ton on the right side.</p>
    <p>While this might dis­ap­point some, it does mean all the watch bands that cur­rent Ap­ple Watch users have are com­pat­i­ble with the new smart­watch.</p>
    <p>The Series 6 comes in four new case colours: blue and red alu­minium, as well as stain­less steel in graphite and gold.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­viewed the graphite stain­less steel model, which comes in a lighter shade of black com­pared with the space­black stain­less steel of pre­vi­ous mod­els. This sub­tle change makes the watch look even more sleek and ex­quis­ite.</p>
    <p>The Series 6’s al­ways-on dis­play is 21/ times brighter than that of</p>
    <p>2 the Series 5, ac­cord­ing to Ap­ple. It does look brighter to me and I find it much eas­ier to read the time and no­ti­fi­ca­tions on this dis­play un­der bright sun­light.</p>
    <p>In­side, the Series 6 has sev­eral up­grades – in­clud­ing the new S6 chip, which of­fers faster per­for­mance than Series 5’s S5 chip.</p>
    <p>The Series 6’s al­ways-on al­time­ter, a new fea­ture, is able to mea­sure el­e­va­tion change in real time. It was fun watch­ing the read­ings go­ing up as I rode the lift to my flat.</p>
    <p>But, while it is mostly ac­cu­rate, there are fluc­tu­a­tions at times. For ex­am­ple, one read­ing is 60m when I am at home, but at other times, it mea­sures 30m or 40m.</p>
    <p>The Series 6 is able to mea­sure oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion, also known as SpO2, with the new blood oxy­gen sen­sor and app. It will con­tinue mea­sur­ing even when you are asleep.</p>
    <p>This is in ad­di­tion to the same health and fit­ness fea­tures – such as heart-rate mon­i­tor­ing and elec­tro­car­dio­gram (ECG) screen­ing – that can al­ready be found in the Series 4 and 5. And with Ap­ple’s new watchOS 7, the Series 6 can track your sleep as well.</p>
    <p>While the new watchOS is sup­ported on mod­els as old as the Series 3, the faster S6 chip makes ev­ery­thing in the Series 6 more re­spon­sive and in­tu­itive.</p>
    <p>Other new fea­tures i nclude a hand-wash­ing re­minder. The builtin sen­sors will au­to­mat­i­cally de­tect when you start wash­ing your hands. A timer will ap­pear, count­ing down from 20 sec­onds – the rec­om­mended du­ra­tion of hand­wash­ing – which is a handy fea­ture to have in this pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Plus, you can set re­minders to wash your hands when you reach home by us­ing geo-lo­ca­tion with the built-in GPS.</p>
    <p>But, due to GPS tri­an­gu­la­tion lim­its, the re­minder does not work if you are not far enough from home.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, after get­ting lunch at a cof­fee shop a block away, the watch does not re­mind me to wash my hands. But it sends me a re­minder after my gro­cery run at a su­per­mar­ket far­ther away.</p>
    <p>The watchOS 7 of­fers sev­eral new op­tions for watch faces, such as Chrono­graph Pro and Ty­po­graph. But my favourite is the GMT face, where the dig­i­tal bezel comes in Pepsi blue and red – the same colours of my dream time­piece, the Rolex GMT Master II.</p>
    <p>With the GMT face, you can select the se­cond world-time by ro­tat­ing the crown to find the city you want. And the se­cond hour hand will point to the bezel to show the se­lected time. This is great for video-con­fer­enc­ing meet­ings with peo­ple in other coun­tries – and, po­ten­tially, for trav­el­ling in the post-pan­demic fu­ture.</p>
    <p>In terms of fit­ness track­ing, the Series 6 is as good as it gets. For step track­ing, the read­ings are very close to those of my own cal­i­brated Series 4, with a mere dif­fer­ence of 50 steps.</p>
    <p>On my usual 5km jog­ging route, the GPS-tracked runs by the Series 6 are only around 10m to 20m off.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the watch’s sleep track­ing can be bet­ter. It does not au­to­mat­i­cally track sleep, like what Fit­bit and Garmin’s fit­ness track­ers and smart­watches do. You have to set the time you sleep and wake, or man­u­ally turn the sleep mode on and off.</p>
    <p>Plus, it only shows your sleep­ing hours. There is no break­down of light and deep sleep, which is not very in­sight­ful.</p>
    <p>Bat­tery life is slightly bet­ter than that of the Series 5. When I have the watch paired to an iPhone with no­ti­fi­ca­tions turned on and a 5km run recorded, the bat­tery has around 50 per cent power re­main­ing by bed­time, com­pared with 40 per cent in the Series 5.</p>
    <p>The Series 6 also of­fers faster charg­ing, juic­ing up from zero to 80 per cent in an hour. I also found that only 6 per cent of its bat­tery life was de­pleted after six hours of sleep.</p>
    <p>For those us­ing the Series 5, the Series 6 is not much of an up­grade. For users of the older mod­els, like my­self, it is prob­a­bly time to up­grade to the Series 6.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if the price – which starts at $599 – is a con­cern, Ap­ple has in­tro­duced the more wal­let­friendly Ap­ple Watch SE, which is priced at $419 and up. It looks like the Series 6, and has the same S5 chip as the Series 5 and an al­wayson al­time­ter like the Series 6.</p>
    <p>It lacks the SpO2 and ECG fea­tures of the Series 6, but if you just need ba­sic smart­watch and fit­ness func­tions, the SE should do the job.</p>
