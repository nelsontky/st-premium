    <p>RACE 1 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>10 Galaxy Em­peror has dis­played enough abil­ity to sug­gest a win is near. Joao Mor­eira should slot him in some­where close to the speed from Gate 2.</p>
    <p>2 For Fun’s Sake showed sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ment last time when se­cond. He should rel­ish the ex­tra 200m.</p>
    <p>12 Money­more is con­sis­tent in this grade and gets his chance again.</p>
    <p>13 Brav­ery And Power mixes his form, but is one who could win any time.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>3 Mul­ti­more caught the eye when win­ning his re­cent trial on the dirt. If he can bring that form to the races, he is go­ing to be com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>2 Give Way Please strug­gled on de­but, but clearly has abil­ity. He is worth for­giv­ing, as he may have needed the run.</p>
    <p>7 Sparkling Dol­phin bolted clear last time. He can do the same again. Watch him closely.</p>
    <p>12 Qi­pao Boss has abil­ity. His lat­est trial on the dirt backs this up. He will be there­abouts.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>2 Vi­tal Spring raced well first-up, be­fore strug­gling at his lat­est out­ing. He can bounce back, es­pe­cially as a course-and-dis­tance win­ner who has been com­pet­i­tive in Class 4 pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>11 Blaz­ing Part­ners rat­tled into se­cond last start. With the right run from the awk­ward gate, he can get into the fin­ish. Boom ap­pren­tice Jerry Chau re­tains the ride. 12 Great Har­vest has shown glimpses of abil­ity. Although he might need fur­ther, he is worth in­clud­ing down in the hand­i­cap.</p>
    <p>8 Shang­hai Dragon gets the ser­vices of cham­pion jockey Zac Pur­ton, who is look­ing to snap a run of 30 win­less rides. He will roll for­ward and play catch me if you can.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>9 Su­per Mis­sion had shown sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ment with each run last term. This in­cluded a nar­row de­feat at his fi­nal out­ing. Ex­pect him to roll for­ward un­der Vag­ner Borges and try to pinch this.</p>
    <p>1 Ev­ery­one’s De­light got off the mark im­pres­sively on de­but. That was not an easy task to do, but he ap­pears to have plenty of rat­ings points in hand.</p>
    <p>4 Courier Won­der has caught the eye at the tri­als. He has also shown plenty of early abil­ity. He de­serves close watch­ing.</p>
    <p>10 Brave Power can fight on for some prize money.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,800M)</p>
    <p>5 Full Power is rac­ing well. He gets a handy 10lb (4.54kg) off, thanks to Chau’s al­lowance. He looks wellplaced and rates as a lead­ing player from the draw.</p>
    <p>9 Cheer­ful Star should im­prove sharply from his first-up run. He is switch­ing to the grass over a longer dis­tance.</p>
    <p>2 Beauty An­gel is look­ing for his third con­sec­u­tive win. He is a twotime Class 4 win­ner. He gets the ser­vices of Pur­ton.</p>
    <p>8 Jimmu is still win­less. But he can get into the equa­tion with the right run.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>10 Su­per Ele­gance is an un­lucky maiden. He has six sec­onds. He looked well in his re­cent trial.</p>
    <p>11 Fly­ing Mighty looks a lightly raced tal­ent. Against him is the draw, but he does get the ser­vices of Pur­ton to off­set that.</p>
    <p>1 Easy Go Easy Win steps down to Class 3. His last two runs in this grade re­sulted in a win and a nar­row se­cond. Chau’s 10lb claim makes him well in at the weights.</p>
    <p>8 Tem­pest Ex­press is open to fur­ther im­prove­ment, step­ping up to the mile.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>6 Mighty Power is near­ing a win. With the soft gate, he gets his chance to break through again. He has had the ben­e­fit of two runs this term.</p>
    <p>10 So Awe­some comes into this off the back of two solid top-three ef­forts. He is lightly raced and his best is yet to come.</p>
    <p>11 All For St Paul’s is look­ing for back-to-back Class 4 wins with Karis Tee­tan astride. He is aided by the soft gate.</p>
    <p>3 Judy’s Star is rac­ing hon­estly. He should be around the mark again.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>4 Cruis­ing won well last start. He is ca­pa­ble of go­ing back-to-back. He has had an in­jury-plagued ca­reer. But, on his day, he is very good. He looks in top con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>9 Good View Clarico won three on the trot, be­fore his last-start third. He ap­pears to have plenty of rat­ing points in hand.</p>
    <p>10 Seven Heav­ens has the abil­ity. He won third-up last cam­paign. He is bet­ter than his record sug­gests. The book­ing of Mor­eira is a plus.</p>
    <p>5 Merid­ian Ge­nius is a lightly raced prospect from the Tony Mil­lard yard. He is still on the up and runs well fresh.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>6 Biz Power has a bright fu­ture. He fin­ished a close se­cond over this course and dis­tance first-up. From the in­side gate, he should be able to fig­ure strongly.</p>
    <p>9 Keep You Warm rat­tled into a nar­row se­cond last start at 31-1. Although he has an awk­ward draw, he should chal­lenge this bunch.</p>
    <p>4 Big For­tune is look­ing for backto-back wins. He rarely runs a bad race.</p>
    <p>3 Lock­heed is an­other who rarely runs a bad race, although he has yet to win.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>6 Sky Field is a supreme tal­ent look­ing for his fourth con­sec­u­tive win. It looks like he will rel­ish the 1,400m trip and will take plenty of beat­ing.</p>
    <p>2 Mighty Gi­ant is look­ing for his fifth con­sec­u­tive win. He is now five wins from eight starts and is a course-and-dis­tance win­ner in Class 2. But he may not have the bril­liance of Sky Field.</p>
    <p>5 Lucky Ex­press is still on the up, de­spite his last-start de­feat. He just needs to han­dle the dis­tance to have a win­ning chance.</p>
    <p>8 Mag­nif­i­cent can roll for­ward and, hope­fully, cling on for prize money.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Sky Field (No. 6) is a supreme tal&#xAD;ent look&#xAD;ing for his fourth con&#xAD;sec&#xAD;u&#xAD;tive win. It looks like he will rel&#xAD;ish the 1,400m trip in to&#xAD;day&#x2019;s fi&#xAD;nal race at Sha Tin.</p>
