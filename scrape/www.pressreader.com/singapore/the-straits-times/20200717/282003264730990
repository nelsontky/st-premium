    <p>MR INDERJIT SINGH, for­mer Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party MP, not­ing in a Face­book post that the rul­ing party did not per­form up to par in GRCs where op­po­si­tion par­ties fielded a strong slate.</p>
    <p>In last Fri­day’s gen­eral elec­tion, the Work­ers’ Party (WP) made an­other break­through by wrest­ing a sec­ond group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency from the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP).</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion vet­eran Chiam See Tong had once de­scribed GRCs as “im­pen­e­tra­ble fortresses”, and ar­gued that the op­po­si­tion had to win at least one to dis­pel this im­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>But have the rul­ing party’s losses in Alju­nied and Sengkang, as well as its nar­row wins in West Coast and East Coast, put paid to this be­lief?</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal an­a­lysts say GE2020 has shown the PAP that there is no safe haven, even with an an­chor min­is­ter helm­ing the team.</p>
    <p>But they added that the GRC sys­tem re­mains a dif­fi­cult ob­sta­cle for op­po­si­tion par­ties to sur­mount, de­spite the WP’s elec­toral suc­cesses.</p>
    <p>The WP made his­tory in 2011 when it be­came the first op­po­si­tion party to win a GRC, 23 years af­ter the sys­tem was first es­tab­lished.</p>
    <p>At the re­cent elec­tion, the party won the new Sengkang GRC with 52.12 per cent of the votes, and widened its vote share in Alju­nied to 59.95 per cent.</p>
    <p>In a com­men­tary for The Straits Times, NUS eco­nom­ics pro­fes­sor Ivan Png said re­gres­sion es­ti­mates that he ran showed the PAP did rel­a­tively bet­ter in sin­gle-mem­ber con­stituen­cies than in GRCs. In GE2020, the PAP vote share in five­mem­ber GRCs was 10.9 per­cent­age points lower than in SMCs.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on Sun­day, for­mer PAP MP Inderjit Singh said the rul­ing party did not per­form up to par in GRCs where op­po­si­tion par­ties fielded strong slates.</p>
    <p>“It is clear that the GRC sys­tem is no longer an ad­van­tage for the PAP,” Mr Singh wrote, adding that the loss of a sec­ond GRC and three po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers – in­clud­ing labour chief Ng Chee Meng – is a “disas­ter” for the PAP.</p>
    <p>“If the PAP fails to re­form, this may be the be­gin­ning of a down­ward spi­ral which will threaten the fu­ture of the party,” he said.</p>
    <p>NO ‘MAGIC’ IN GRCS?</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Eu­gene Tan, a law don at the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity, said the WP’s suc­cess in Alju­nied and Sengkang has shown that GRCs are not im­preg­nable fortresses for the PAP.</p>
    <p>“There is no magic in a min­is­ter helm­ing a GRC, mak­ing it in­vin­ci­ble,” he said. “The PAP may well win big in GRCs, but it must not be for­got­ten that it has lost, and can lose big, in GRCs.”</p>
    <p>For op­po­si­tion par­ties, one long­stand­ing chal­lenge has been at­tract­ing enough good can­di­dates. In past elec­tions, par­ties would typ­i­cally man­age to field only one or two star can­di­dates in each GRC.</p>
    <p>This time, the WP’s Sengkang slate was as good as – or close to – that of its op­po­nents, Mr Singh told ST. The Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) team in West Coast also of­fered “bet­ter qual­ity and di­ver­sity” in com­par­i­son with their PAP coun­ter­parts, he added.</p>
    <p>“The scales will be tipped the next round, as more good can­di­dates are will­ing to join the op­po­si­tion,” Mr Singh said.</p>
    <p>But ob­servers also cau­tioned against over­stat­ing the degree to which GRCs are now vul­ner­a­ble, even to op­po­si­tion par­ties that field cred­i­ble teams.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Derek da Cunha noted that the PSP un­veiled a large con­tin­gent of 24 can­di­dates in its maiden elec­tion, likely be­liev­ing it could win sev­eral con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>But its fail­ure to take West Coast GRC – de­spite field­ing party chief and for­mer PAP MP Tan Cheng Bock as well as hav­ing Mr Lee Hsien Yang, the younger brother of Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, can­vass for votes – il­lus­trates the ex­tent to which GRCs still re­main PAP stronghold­s, he said.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Bil­veer Singh made the point that the WP’s suc­cess can be at­trib­uted to how it has been work­ing the ground in Alju­nied for nine years.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the younger vot­ers of Sengkang likely voted against the PAP out of a dis­taste for its “puni­tive-type” pol­i­tics, he said, re­fer­ring to po­lice re­ports made against the WP’s Ms Raeesah Khan, and cor­rec­tion or­ders is­sued un­der the Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act dur­ing the hus­tings.</p>
    <p>Even so, the PAP still has in­flu­en­tial min­is­ters, the power of in­cum­bency, and na­tional re­sources, Dr Singh said.</p>
    <p>“The WP is far from chal­leng­ing the PAP ex­cept on two counts – if the PAP is split due to in­ter­nal in­fight­ing, or the op­po­si­tion builds a coali­tion – both of which seem highly un­likely in the near fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Mr Har­ri­son Cheng, as­so­ciate di­rec­tor of con­sul­tancy Con­trol Risks, noted that 15 out of the 17 GRCs are still in PAP hands. “The struc­tural fea­tures of the GRC sys­tem ul­ti­mately mean that it is very dif­fi­cult – though not im­pos­si­ble – to wrest con­trol of a GRC,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr da Cunha said: “In re­al­ity, the ac­tual com­pe­ti­tion is still nar­rowed to be­tween the PAP and the WP, and this is largely con­fined to the eastern part of the is­land.”</p>
    <p>When the GRC sys­tem was in­tro­duced in 1988 to en­sure mi­nor­ity rep­re­sen­ta­tion in Par­lia­ment, the polls that year saw Sin­ga­pore di­vided into 42 SMCs and 13 three­mem­ber GRCs.</p>
    <p>Three years later, the num­ber of SMCs was halved and the size of GRCs in­creased to in­clude fourmem­ber con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>In 1996, a pro­posal to fur­ther in­crease the max­i­mum size of GRCs from four to six mem­bers was tabled in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>All four op­po­si­tion MPs in the House at the time cried foul.</p>
    <p>Mr Chiam See Tong ar­gued the move would help “new and weak” PAP can­di­dates win seats by rid­ing on the coat-tails of more ex­pe­ri­enced MPs, while WP MP Low Thia</p>
    <p>Khi­ang said the changes would make it even more dif­fi­cult for op­po­si­tion par­ties to win seats.</p>
    <p>But then Prime Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong said six-mem­ber GRCs were nec­es­sary to es­tab­lish a “crit­i­cal mass of res­i­dents” in some ar­eas, so that com­mu­nity de­vel­op­ment coun­cils could do their work.</p>
    <p>The move to en­large GRCs was po­lit­i­cally neu­tral, as the party field­ing the stronger team would nat­u­rally emerge vic­to­ri­ous, he added.</p>
    <p>PM Lee ini­ti­ated re­forms to re­duce the av­er­age size of GRCs and cre­ate more SMCs ahead of GE2011 – a shift that has con­tin­ued. In GE2020, there were 11 five-mem­ber GRCs, six four-mem­ber GRCs, and 14 SMCs.</p>
    <p>NO GRC THAT IS IN­VIN­CI­BLE</p>
    <p>There is no magic in a min­is­ter helm­ing a GRC, mak­ing it in­vin­ci­ble. The PAP may well win big in GRCs, but it must not be for­got­ten that it has lost, and can ’’ lose big, in GRCs.</p>
    <p>AS­SO­CIATE PRO­FES­SOR EU­GENE TAN, a Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity law don, not­ing that the WP’s suc­cess in Alju­nied and Sengkang has shown that GRCs are not im­preg­nable fortresses for the PAP. CHAL­LENG­ING SYS­TEM</p>
    <p>The struc­tural fea­tures of the GRC sys­tem ul­ti­mately mean that it is very dif­fi­cult – though not im­pos­si­ble – to wrest con­trol ’’ of a GRC.</p>
    <p>MR HAR­RI­SON CHENG, as­so­ciate di­rec­tor of con­sul­tancy Con­trol Risks, not­ing that 15 out of the 17 GRCs are still in PAP hands.</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING AHEAD</p>
    <p>How is the PAP likely to change its strat­egy in the next gen­eral elec­tion, given that it took a bruis­ing this time round?</p>
    <p>First, the party may re-eval­u­ate what makes a strong team, es­pe­cially given what Mr Cheng de­scribed as the “less-than-im­pres­sive” show­ing of sev­eral fourth-gen­er­a­tion lead­ers who headed hotly con­tested GRCs.</p>
    <p>He added that vot­ers will pay close at­ten­tion to the track record of the PAP’s 4G lead­ers in the years lead­ing up to the next GE, fo­cus­ing in par­tic­u­lar on how they en­gage the op­po­si­tion, civil so­ci­ety and di­verse voices out­side Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“(This) will be a much stronger de­ter­mi­nant of whether the pub­lic buys into the PAP’s brand­ing dur­ing the elec­tion cam­paign pe­riod as a suf­fi­ciently in­clu­sive, re­spon­sive and uni­fy­ing force in pol­i­tics,” he said.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing party may also relook its strat­egy for GRCs, said Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>One pos­si­bil­ity, he said, is that the PAP could re­vive three-mem­ber GRCs and get ju­nior po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers to helm them.</p>
    <p>This would en­sure mi­nor­ity rep­re­sen­ta­tion while keep­ing the loss con­tained if the party loses, he added. It would also help man­age the per­cep­tion that the GRC sys­tem is stacked against the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of po­lit­i­cal sci­ence Netina Tan of Canada’s McMaster Univer­sity ex­pects the PAP to al­ter its can­di­date se­lec­tion method to draw younger can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing party will also have to im­prove its on­line elec­toral strate­gies and time­li­ness to re­gain con­trol of on­line nar­ra­tives, she added.</p>
    <p>She also flagged the pos­si­bil­ity of bound­ary changes at the next elec­tion. Elec­toral bound­aries have been known to change with elec­tions, in­clud­ing in hotly con­tested seats .</p>
    <p>Dr Singh said the PAP will have to “scan the ground” and ad­just to what it finds, or risk more GRCs fall­ing to the op­po­si­tion. “I think the younger gen­er­a­tion of vot­ers want to see change in their po­lit­i­cal lead­ers, poli­cies and in pol­i­tics,” he said.</p>
