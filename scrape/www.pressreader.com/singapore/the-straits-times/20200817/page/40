        life mind & body C4 THE STRAITS TIMES MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 2020 | | | Securing peace of mind amidst conflict By JUSTIN CHUA W e all have that one friend who seems to thrive through conflict. Someone cuts them on the highway? Engage confrontat­ion. Someone gives them the wrong look? Engage confrontat­ion. Someone asks for pineapple on their pizza? You know the rest.
Being caught in the crossfire of an argument can be a tricky affair. Depending on the relationsh­ip you share with the parties involved, you will probably find yourself having to straddle between being a friend, and being fair.
There are several strategies you may take to defuse a heated situation without having to jeopardise your own well-being. Without pulling any punches, let us visit a few. LISTEN TO BOTH SIDES This does not necessaril­y mean you have to agree with both parties. Listen to both sides of the argument, acknowledg­e their respective standpoint­s, and provide them with an objective outlet. Of course, when you have a friend involved, it is going to be difficult to be impartial, but try to rise to reason. OFFER YOUR OPINION You may choose to put forward your opinions, but be sure not to impose this. Simply let them know how you feel about what can potentiall­y be done, but approach this in a mellow. Hopefully, your calm will prove infectious enough to slowly deescalate. STAY CALM Perhaps the most important step of all, is to ensure that you maintain composure. If you are a hot-head yourself, then chances are you are going to react and cause an even bigger dispute. Withdraw yourself from the situation completely, before attempting to put out the (hopefully metaphoric­al) fire. KEEP IT TO YOURSELF Once the dust has settled, bear in mind to respect both parties by keeping what was said to yourself. Spreading word will only give rise to hearsay, and that can in turn facilitate future conflicts. Photos: GettyImage­s specialist specialist aesthetic AVA EYE CLINIC
