    <p>I go to Tim Ho Wan for baked BBQ pork buns and steamed sponge cake. But from now till Aug 16, I have an­other rea­son to visit the dim sum chain.</p>
    <p>It is run­ning a pro­mo­tion menu of four dishes and the Fried Radish Cake With Shrimps ($8.80, left) is the one call­ing my name.</p>
    <p>The pieces of rice cake boast loads of wok hei and are yummy with a blend of soya sauce and fiery chilli sauce. There are bits of pre­served radish and beansprout­s to add crunch as well as suc­cu­lent prawns.</p>
    <p>Mush­room & Vegetable Dumplings ($5) are good too, with a translu­cent skin en­cas­ing a well-sea­soned mix of mush­rooms, chives and turnip.</p>
    <p>Noo­dles In Scal­lion Oil & Spicy Sauce ($6.80) sounds sim­ple, but is a good carb filler. The sauce is made with 17 in­gre­di­ents, but it is the fra­grant scal­lion oil that hits the spot.</p>
    <p>The fourth dish, Braised Pork Soft Ribs ($7.50), is the most sub­stan­tial, but the sauce is a tad sweet for me and I pre­fer my meat with more bite.</p>
    <p>The dishes are also avail­able for take­away and de­liv­ery.</p>

    <p>FRESH SUM­MER ITAL­IAN FARE</p>
    <p>The world may seem to have come to a stand­still for many peo­ple this year, but restau­rant menus that are led by in­gre­di­ents con­tinue to change with the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Among them is Buona Terra, the one-Miche­lin­starred Ital­ian restau­rant in Scotts Road, which has un­veiled its sum­mer menu.</p>
    <p>Chef De­nis Luc­chi has grown from strength to strength since launch­ing the restau­rant more than seven years ago and his lat­est ef­forts con­tinue that trend.</p>
    <p>There is no a la carte menu for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>Lunch is a choice of three ($88), four ($108) and five ($128) cour­ses. And din­ner is priced at $148 for four cour­ses and $178 and up for a Buona Terra Ex­pe­ri­ence that is cu­rated by the chef.</p>
    <p>For my din­ner last week, the dishes in­cluded a Cut­tle­fish Salad (above) where strips of per­fectly cooked cut­tle­fish were dressed with a light lemon dress­ing and topped with juli­enned cel­ery, green ap­ple, shiso flower and raw al­monds. It was re­fresh­ing and per­fect for hot weather.</p>
    <p>There was also Scampi, seared and ac­com­pa­nied with shaved bot­targa and car­rots. On the plate, too, were sauteed Bou­chot mus­sels housed in a shell made from filo pas­try stained with squid ink. And ty­ing ev­ery­thing to­gether was a de­li­cious saf­fron sauce.</p>
    <p>Buona Terra, 29 Scotts Road New­ton Noon to 3pm, last or­der at 2pm (Mon­days to Fri­days); 6 to 10.30pm, last or­der at 9.15pm (Mon­days to Satur­days) 6733-0209</p>
