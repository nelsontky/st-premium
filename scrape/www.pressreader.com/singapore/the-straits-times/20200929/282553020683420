    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>A dream con­tains a po­tent mes­sage – though it may feel some­what more dra­matic than it needs to be.</p>
    <p>Pay at­ten­tion, though.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You can see more deeply into other peo­ple’s hearts – though you may not like what you see some­times. Just roll with it.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>This is a good day to go it alone. Your typ­i­cal style has turned up­side-down, but that is good for per­sonal ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing great – and with good rea­son. Your per­sonal en­ergy is fan­tas­tic and you should be able to have fun do­ing al­most any­thing.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You can­not quite wrap your head around the day’s big news – but that just means things are more com­pli­cated.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You should find it hard to get much done – but do not panic. It is a good time to plan, re­group and think about mak­ing changes.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You need to ad­just your be­hav­iour to chang­ing cir­cum­stances – things will then start to turn around for you.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>In­dulge your artis­tic side – you need to get your hands dirty with paint, ink or clay, or what­ever it takes to bring your vi­sion to life.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You need to open a fig­u­ra­tive door – op­por­tu­ni­ties abound if you are will­ing to cre­ate them for your­self. You should be able to do quite a bit.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You have to reach out – there are peo­ple who need to hear what you have to say. Your so­cial en­ergy is pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You have to do what is right, even if that means miss­ing out on some­thing fun or be­ing some­where you would rather not be.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>The day’s amaz­ing en­ergy gives you the lift you need to rein­vent your­self. If you are happy with who you are, so much the bet­ter.</p>
