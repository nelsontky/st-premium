    <p>Malaysians thronged hy­per­mar­kets and restau­rants over the week­end to stock up on sup­plies and dine with fam­ily and friends, ahead of new move­ment curbs widely ex­pected to be an­nounced by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin to­day to tackle surg­ing coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>Long queues were seen at su­per­mar­kets and hy­per­mar­kets, and items such as toi­let rolls and veg­eta­bles were said to be out of stock at some of them. Two Cabi­net min­is­ters is­sued state­ments yes­ter­day urg­ing shop­pers not to panic buy.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Amna Karmila, 50, was among those who ate out.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to take my 16-year-old son for a quick break­fast treat on Satur­day be­fore tighter rules kick in as he has been study­ing hard at home and school is sup­posed to re­open on Jan 20. I was shocked to see a re­ally long queue of peo­ple out­side the restau­rant,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ms Irene Low, a 40-year-old who works in the re­tail in­dus­try, had a meal with her hus­band’s aunt who had said it was the “last chance to do so” be­fore new re­stric­tions kicked in.</p>
    <p>Tu­tor Nor­vi­viana Hasan, 35, mean­while took her chil­dren to an in­door theme park in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers also used the week­end to make short trips.</p>
    <p>A 26-year-old Euro­pean ex­pa­tri­ate work­ing in com­mu­ni­ca­tions, who wanted to be known only as Gaby, told The Straits Times: “I went to Gent­ing High­lands this week­end to en­joy the nice view and the moun­tain. We didn’t leave the ho­tel. We just wanted to see the hori­zon be­fore be­ing in a lock­down again.”</p>
    <p>Ms Nur Syawa­rina Mokhtar, a ho­tel re­cep­tion­ist in Port Dick­son, one of the pop­u­lar beach­side des­ti­na­tions clos­est to the cap­i­tal Kuala Lumpur, said the re­sort where she worked was 90 per cent oc­cu­pied at the week­end, higher than the oc­cu­pancy dur­ing the New Year week­end.</p>
    <p>“This may be due to the ex­pected an­nounce­ment of tighter move­ment con­trols this week. (On Satur­day) there were traf­fic jams the whole day in Port Dick­son due to the large num­ber of lo­cal tourists,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ru­mours of an im­pend­ing lock­down have been cir­cu­lat­ing since the coun­try’s top health of­fi­cial, Health Di­rec­tor-Gen­eral Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah, called for tar­geted lock­downs last Wed­nes­day, as the num­ber of ac­tive coro­n­avirus cases reached an all-time high, threat­en­ing to over­whelm Malaysia’s hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob had said that Tan Sri Muhyid­din would an­nounce new mea­sures to­day to tackle the lat­est spike. But he added that the mea­sures would not re­sem­ble the near full-lock­down Malaysia had im­posed for al­most three months last year dur­ing the be­gin­ning of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic Trade and Con­sumer Af­fairs Min­is­ter Alexander Nanta Linggi yes­ter­day urged Malaysians to avoid panic buy­ing, as­sur­ing them that food sup­plies were ad­e­quate in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Is­mail had also urged the same, say­ing the gov­ern­ment would pro­vide ad­e­quate time for Malaysians to pre­pare for any new mea­sures an­nounced.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s daily cases reached an all-time high of 3,027 last Thurs­day. It recorded 2,433 cases yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of ac­tive cases now rep­re­sent 95 per cent of the bed ca­pac­ity set aside in public hos­pi­tals to deal with coro­n­avirus pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Deaths from Covid-19 are also ris­ing sharply in Malaysia, with 80 deaths recorded in the first 10 days of this year.</p>
    <p>The coun­try now has 135,992 to­tal coro­n­avirus cases recorded, with 551 deaths.</p>
