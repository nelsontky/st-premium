    <p>•</p>
    <p>The New York Stock Ex­change (NYSE) has said it will delist three Chi­nese tele­com com­pa­nies, con­firm­ing its lat­est U-turn on the mat­ter a day af­ter US Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steve Mnuchin told the NYSE chief he dis­agreed with an ear­lier de­ci­sion to re­verse the delist­ing move.</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s de­ci­sion, which takes ef­fect on Mon­day, marks the third time in less than a week the Big Board has ruled on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>The flip-flop­ping high­lights the con­fu­sion over which firms were in­cluded in an ex­ec­u­tive order from Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in Novem­ber to bar US per­sons from in­vest­ing in pub­licly traded com­pa­nies Wash­ing­ton deems to be tied to the Chi­nese mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>It also comes amid es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions within Wash­ing­ton on China pol­icy in the fi­nal days of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“There is a sit­u­a­tion where there is an out­go­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion that is dis­en­gaged and (there are) or­ders sit­ting out there, so some­thing has to be done, but no one wants to take on re­spon­si­bil­ity,” said Mr Leland Miller, CEO of the US-based con­sul­tancy China Beige Book. “I think in fu­ture that any­one get­ting th­ese or­ders will say: ‘Tell us ex­actly what you want us to do’, and force ad­min­is­tra­tions to be more fo­cused.”</p>
    <p>The NYSE had last Thurs­day an­nounced plans to delist China Mo­bile, China Tele­com and China Uni­com Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, it did a U-turn af­ter con­sult­ing with reg­u­la­tors in con­nec­tion with the US Trea­sury’s Of­fice of For­eign As­sets Con­trol and de­cided to keep them listed.</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s de­ci­sion marks a re­turn to the orig­i­nal plan.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to keep the com­pa­nies listed had prompted crit­i­cism that the Trea­sury was be­ing dovish on China. Mr Mnuchin has long been seen as seek­ing to thwart at­tempts by hard­lin­ers in the ad­min­is­tra­tion – many led by the State Depart­ment – to crack down on Chi­nese com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>But sources who asked to re­main anony­mous due to the sen­si­tiv­ity of the mat­ter said Mr Mnuchin had called NYSE pres­i­dent Stacey Cun­ning­ham on Tues­day to ex­press his con­cerns over the de­ci­sion not to delist the com­pa­nies, as the ex­change sought fur­ther con­fir­ma­tion on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“The Trea­sury sec­re­tary was on the phone with the NYSE (pres­i­dent) now and was told that NYSE would re­verse their de­ci­sion,” a US of­fi­cial told Reuters on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>IN­VESTOR COM­PLI­ANCE URGED</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the ex­change op­er­a­tor said in a state­ment that its lat­est de­ci­sion, to move for­ward with the delist­ings, was based on “new spe­cific guid­ance re­ceived on Jan 5, 2021, that the Depart­ment of Trea­sury’s Of­fice of For­eign As­sets Con­trol pro­vided to the NYSE”.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing in the se­cu­ri­ties will be sus­pended at 4am ET (5pm Sin­ga­pore time) on Mon­day, the NYSE said. A spokesman for the ex­change op­er­a­tor de­clined to com­ment fur­ther.</p>
    <p>The flip-flop­ping caused in­vestors to sell po­si­tions in the se­cu­ri­ties, the prices of which dropped on the initial an­nounce­ment, then rose on the next, and tum­bled again on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor Ben Sasse, a mem­ber of the Se­nate Select Com­mit­tee on In­tel­li­gence, said the de­ci­sion was the “right call”.</p>
    <p>“Chi­nese firms that re­ject fun­da­men­tal trans­parency re­quire­ments and have ties to the Chi­nese mil­i­tary shouldn’t ben­e­fit from Amer­i­can in­vest­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s ex­ec­u­tive order tech­ni­cally takes ef­fect on Mon­day, but does not ban pur­chases by US in­vestors un­til Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>While the di­rec­tive stops short of forc­ing a delist­ing, a sep­a­rate Bill signed into law by Mr Trump in Novem­ber will kick Chi­nese com­pa­nies off US bourses if they do not fully com­ply with the coun­try’s au­dit­ing rules in three years.</p>
    <p>The State Depart­ment plans to re­lease as soon as Wed­nes­day a fact sheet urg­ing US in­vestors to com­ply with the ex­ec­u­tive order, ac­cord­ing to three peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter and a copy of the doc­u­ment seen by Reuters.</p>
    <p>The Trea­sury said on Wednes</p>
    <p>The US State Depart­ment plans to re­lease as soon as Wed­nes­day a fact sheet urg­ing US in­vestors to com­ply with the ex­ec­u­tive order, ac­cord­ing to three peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter and a copy of the doc­u­ment seen by Reuters. day that mar­ket in­ter­me­di­aries could help in­vestors di­vest se­cu­ri­ties of the black­listed com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>S&P Dow Jones Indices, which also made U-turns in de­ci­sions, said late on Wed­nes­day that it will re­move the three tele­com com­pa­nies’ Amer­i­can de­posi­tary re­ceipts from its bench­marks be­fore Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Other in­dex mak­ers, in­clud­ing FTSE Russell and MSCI, have cut a dozen Chi­nese com­pa­nies on the list from their bench­marks, but have not re­moved the three tele­com firms, all of which have ma­jor pas­sive US funds among their top share­hold­ers.</p>
