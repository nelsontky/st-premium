    <p>NEW DELHI • An In­dian court has sum­moned Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma over a former em­ployee’s claim that he was wrong­fully fired af­ter ob­ject­ing to what he saw as cen­sor­ship and fake news on com­pany apps, doc­u­ments seen by Reuters showed.</p>
    <p>The case comes weeks af­ter In­dia cited se­cu­rity con­cerns as it banned Alibaba’s UC News, UC Browser and 57 other Chi­nese apps in the wake of a clash be­tween the two coun­tries’ forces on their bor­der. Fol­low­ing the ban, which China has criticised, In­dia sought writ­ten an­swers from all af­fected com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing whether they cen­sored con­tent or acted for any for­eign govern­ment.</p>
    <p>In court fil­ings dated July 20 and pre­vi­ously not re­ported, the former em­ployee of Alibaba’s UC Web, Mr Push­pen­dra Singh Par­mar, al­leges that the com­pany used to cen­sor con­tent seen as un­favourable to China, and its apps UC Browser and UC News show­cased false news “to cause so­cial and po­lit­i­cal tur­moil”.</p>
    <p>Civil Judge So­nia Sheokand of a dis­trict court in Gu­ru­gram, a satel­lite city of In­dia’s cap­i­tal New Delhi, has is­sued sum­mons for Alibaba, Mr Ma and about a dozen in­di­vid­u­als or com­pany units, ask­ing them to ap­pear in court or through a lawyer on Wed­nes­day, court doc­u­ments showed.</p>
    <p>The judge has also sought writ­ten re­sponses from the com­pany and its ex­ec­u­tives within 30 days, ac­cord­ing to the sum­mons.</p>
    <p>UC In­dia said in a state­ment it had been “un­wa­ver­ing in its com­mit­ment to the In­dia mar­ket and the wel­fare of its lo­cal em­ploy­ees, and its poli­cies are in com­pli­ance with lo­cal laws”, and it is “un­able to com­ment on on­go­ing lit­i­ga­tion”.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives of Alibaba did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment from the Chi­nese com­pany or on be­half of Mr Ma.</p>
    <p>Mr Par­mar, who worked as an as­so­ciate direc­tor at the UC Web of­fice in Gu­ru­gram un­til Oc­to­ber 2017 and is seek­ing US$268,000 (S$370,500) in dam­ages, re­ferred Reuters queries to his lawyer, Mr Atul Ah­lawat, who de­clined to com­ment, say­ing the mat­ter was sub ju­dice.</p>
    <p>The court case is the lat­est hur­dle for Alibaba in In­dia af­ter the In­dian govern­ment’s app ban, fol­low­ing which UC Web has started lay­ing off some staff in the coun­try.</p>
