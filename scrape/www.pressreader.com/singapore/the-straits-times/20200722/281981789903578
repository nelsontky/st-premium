    <p>Come Nov 2, the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity (BCA), which has gained new im­por­tance as the go-to agency for con­struc­tion firms amid Covid-19, will have a new chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Mr Hugh Lim, 55, a Singapore Armed Forces scholar who has been CEO of the BCA since 2017, will re­lin­quish his ap­point­ment and hand over du­ties to Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB) ex­ec­u­tive vice-pres­i­dent Kelvin Wong, 49.</p>
    <p>The joint an­nounce­ment by the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment (MND) and the BCA yes­ter­day thanked Mr Lim for his con­tri­bu­tions and wel­comed Mr Wong to his new ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>The BCA is a statu­tory board that aims to en­sure Singapore’s built en­vi­ron­ment is safe, of high qual­ity, sus­tain­able and friendly.</p>
    <p>Following the dis­pro­por­tion­ate ef­fects of the coro­n­avirus on work­ers in the con­struc­tion sec­tor – in­clud­ing 45,260 mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries who have tested pos­i­tive to date – the au­thor­ity has also taken on a lead­ing role in help­ing con­struc­tion firms nav­i­gate Covid-19 reg­u­la­tions and tap govern­ment re­sources.</p>
    <p>The MND and BCA said Mr Wong over­saw EDB’s Skill­sFu­ture ef­forts and was re­spon­si­ble for the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Lead­er­ship De­vel­op­ment Ini­tia­tive, which helped de­velop Sin­ga­pore­ans as busi­ness lead­ers in their fields.</p>
    <p>He also played a ma­jor role in grow­ing Singapore’s sup­ply chain and con­nec­tiv­ity, with his spear­head­ing of the Na­tional Trade Plat­form, in par­tic­u­lar po­si­tion­ing Singapore as an im­por­tant trade, sup­ply chain and fi­nan­cial trad­ing hub.</p>
    <p>The MND and BCA noted that dur­ing his three years as CEO at BCA, he spurred the in­dus­try to adopt tech­nol­ogy, sup­port­ing in­dus­try-re­lated re­search and in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>He saw the amend­ment of key leg­is­la­tion which pro­moted good gov­er­nance and trans­parency when it came to build­ing main­te­nance and strata man­age­ment, as well as in­tro­duced a new reg­u­la­tory frame­work for lifts and es­ca­la­tors, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>He also in­tro­duced a pro­vi­sion which al­lowed the Govern­ment to man­date a Pro­gres­sive Wage Model for lo­cals in the lift main­te­nance in­dus­try, in­creas­ing their pay by up­grad­ing their skills and im­prov­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>The BCA, like other agen­cies, is adapt­ing to the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion as it de­vel­ops, and has said re­cently that de­sign stan­dards for new build­ings might have to be changed to boost ven­ti­la­tion in crowded spa­ces and im­prove air qual­ity.</p>
    <p>It is in the midst of dis­cus­sions with in­dus­try stake­hold­ers and ex­perts on whether new rules are nec­es­sary.</p>
