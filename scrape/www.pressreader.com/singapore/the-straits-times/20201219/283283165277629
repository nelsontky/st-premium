    <p>Some of the ear­li­est im­ages of Sin­ga­pore were taken shortly af­ter com­mer­cial pho­tog­ra­phy was in­vented in 1839 in France.</p>
    <p>And Per­anakans were among the ear­li­est sub­jects cap­tured by the pi­o­neer Euro­pean pho­tog­ra­phers, as shown in Amek Gam­bar – Tak­ing Pic­tures: Per­anakans And Pho­tog­ra­phy – a new coffee-ta­ble book by the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum (ACM) that was launched on Tuesday.</p>
    <p>Pho­tog­ra­phy spread quickly around the world af­ter Euro­peans es­tab­lished the ear­li­est com­mer­cial stu­dios in 1840. By 1843, itin­er­ant Can­tonese and Ja­panese pho­tog­ra­phers, trav­el­ling from port to port look­ing for work, were seen in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Per­anakans across Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, In­done­sia, Thai­land and Myan­mar did long sit­tings in the stu­dios of th­ese pho­tog­ra­phers, who com­peted with Euro­peans to cap­ture their well-heeled sub­jects’ fa­cial like­ness, dress and rit­u­als.</p>
    <p>ACM’s 420-page tome show­cases a pri­vate col­lec­tion of more than 2,500 rare 19th- and 20th­cen­tury pho­to­graphs do­nated to the Per­anakan Mu­seum in 2015 by the late Per­anakan phi­lan­thropists, Mr Lee Kip Lee and his wife El­iz­a­beth.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tion was dis­played in an ex­hi­bi­tion at the Per­anakan Mu­seum from May 2018 to Fe­bru­ary last year.</p>
    <p>The book is edited by their son, art his­to­rian and Per­anakan scholar Peter Lee. The 57-year-old says his mother was an avid col­lec­tor of her­itage pieces, from heir­loom jewellery and porce­lain to vin­tage tex­tiles and fur­ni­ture.</p>
    <p>Since his univer­sity days in Lon­don in the early 1990s, Mr Lee has also been con­tribut­ing to his par­ents’ col­lec­tion with rare finds from auc­tion houses, spe­cial­ist photo deal­ers, vin­tage stores and eBay.</p>
    <p>“Although the photo col­lec­tion was built over many decades, it was from 1992 that the bulk of it re­ally started. It be­came my goal – with my mother’s bless­ing – to fill a gap in the vis­ual re­sources avail­able to the pub­lic here, by build­ing up an ar­chive of early pho­to­graphic im­ages of peo­ple in this coun­try and the re­gion,” says Mr Lee, who is the younger brother of singer-com­poser Dick Lee, 64, and has two other broth­ers, John, 59, and An­drew, 54.</p>
    <p>That ar­chive would then be do­nated to a Sin­ga­pore pub­lic in­sti­tu­tion, adds Mr Peter Lee.</p>
    <p>The au­thor of the 2014 book,</p>
    <p>Sarong Ke­baya: Per­anakan Fash­ion In An In­ter­con­nected World 1500-1950, also con­sults and cu­rates on an ad-hoc ba­sis with Sin­ga­pore mu­se­ums.</p>
    <p>He re­calls that dur­ing his univer­sity days in Lon­don, he would scour the an­tique mar­kets around his fam­ily’s apartment near Por­to­bello and the ho­tels around Rus­sell Square, which reg­u­larly held pho­to­graph fairs.</p>
    <p>“In the early 1990s, any pho­to­graph of Sin­ga­pore was more ex­pen­sive be­cause of de­mand and the rar­ity,” he says.</p>
    <p>“An old print from Sin­ga­pore would set me back about $600, while im­ages from Myan­mar were much cheaper, cost­ing less than $50 in some in­stances.”</p>
    <p>His love of pho­tog­ra­phy was sparked by his late un­cle, ar­chi­tect and lec­turer Lee Kip Lin, who wrote The Sin­ga­pore House: 1819-1942 in 1988.</p>
    <p>Af­ter grad­u­at­ing in 1990 with a master’s de­gree in art his­tory from the Univer­sity of Lon­don, he con­tin­ued to build the col­lec­tion of rare Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asian pho­to­graphs.</p>
    <p>“So far, our un­der­stand­ing of pho­tog­ra­phy’s ar­rival and im­pact in South-east Asia has been lim­ited by ex­ist­ing ar­chives in Western pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions,” says Mr Lee, who adds that the cur­rent col­lec­tions of pho­to­graphs are the lega­cies of Western tourists, pho­tog­ra­phers and diplo­mats who trav­elled to South-east Asia dur­ing the 19th and 20th cen­turies.</p>
    <p>The do­na­tion to the Per­anakan Mu­seum fea­tures sev­eral rare pho­tos that were taken and owned by peo­ple liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion which, Mr Lee notes, make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“The pho­to­graphs in Amek Gam­bar show that Asians were al­ready ex­per­i­ment­ing with iden­tity in the 1800s and part of a so­ci­ety which was rapidly evolv­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>He points to a 1920s gelatin sil­ver print of a Nonya woman in a com­pos­ite photo. On the left, she is seated and dressed in a baju pan­jang (long robe worn over a batik sarong) and, on the right, she is stand­ing and im­per­son­at­ing a Bri­tish gen­tle­man in trop­i­cal Western at­tire (pith hat or “topi”, drill cot­ton suit and tie).</p>
    <p>The book also fea­tures es­says by sev­eral in­ter­na­tional schol­ars, such as Dr Joachim K. Bautze from Ger­many, who has taught at univer</p>
    <p>Although the photo col­lec­tion was built over many decades, it was from 1992 that the bulk of it re­ally started.

    <p>sities in Ber­lin and Heidelberg as well as Tokyo; Aus­tralian art his­to­rian Gael New­ton; and Bri­ton Se­bas­tian Dob­son.</p>
    <p>Mr Dob­son wrote about German photograph­er Au­gust Sachtler, who was based in Sin­ga­pore in 1863 and took ex­pe­di­tions around the Malay Ar­chi­pel­ago.</p>
    <p>In the early pages of the book, French con­trib­u­tor Gilles Mas­sot throws the spot­light on a da­guerreo­type of Thian Hock Keng Tem­ple in Telok Ayer Street taken on July 6, 1844, by French Cus­toms in­spec­tor and photograph­er Jules Itier. The da­guerreo­type is a pho­to­graphic process in­vented by French­man Louis-Jac­ques-Mande Da­guerre in 1839.</p>
    <p>Mr Mas­sot, a fine arts lec­turer at Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts who moved here more than 30 years ago, es­tab­lished in a pa­per pub­lished in the His­tory Of Pho­tog­ra­phy that the im­age of the tem­ple “is in­deed the ear­li­est ex­tant and dated pho­to­graph of the whole of Asia”.</p>
    <p>He tells The Straits Times: “It sig­ni­fied the when and where of Asian cul­tures and civil­i­sa­tions en­ter­ing moder­nity.”</p>
    <p>The pho­to­graph is now in a pri­vate col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other con­trib­u­tor to Amek Gam­bar, Ms New­ton, who spe­cialises in early South-east Asian pho­tog­ra­phy, has re­searched John Thom­son, the pi­o­neer of the mod­ern travel pho­tog­ra­phy book.</p>
    <p>He ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore in 1862 and set up the Thom­son Broth­ers stu­dio. Like com­mer­cial pho­tog­ra­phers at the time, he used glass plate nega­tives to pro­duce mul­ti­ple prints on pho­to­graphic pa­per.</p>
    <p>Ms New­ton says: “Thom­son’s Straits Set­tle­ments nega­tives are lost, but his sur­viv­ing prints are gems which show how he ex­ploited the new medium to trans­port view­ers across the world to an­other place and time.</p>
    <p>“In his out­door pho­tog­ra­phy, we look into the eyes of the lo­cals as they worked – most of whom had no chance of hav­ing a por­trait taken in his stu­dio.</p>
    <p>“As a fre­quent visi­tor to Sin­ga­pore, I see many par­al­lels which al­low present-day doc­u­men­tary pho­tog­ra­phers to con­tinue Thom­son’s legacy by get­ting out on the streets and record­ing how the whole gamut of so­ci­ety lives.”</p>
