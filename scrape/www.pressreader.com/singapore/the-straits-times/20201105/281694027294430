    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump falsely de­clared yes­ter­day he had won re-election against Mr Joe Bi­den, call­ing the vote-count­ing process “a fraud on the Amer­i­can public” and said he would ask the Supreme Court to in­ter­vene, although the fi­nal re­sults are not out yet.</p>
    <p>“We did win this election,” Mr Trump said in an ex­tra­or­di­nary speech de­liv­ered from the cer­e­mo­nial East Room of the White House shortly be­fore 2.30am lo­cal time (3.30pm Sin­ga­pore time).</p>
    <p>“This is a fraud on the Amer­i­can public,” he added, com­plain­ing about on­go­ing vote count­ing after not­ing that he held leads in sev­eral states that had not been called i n his favour, Penn­syl­va­nia.</p>
    <p>“Frankly we did win this election,” said the Republican, who ac­cord­ing to ini­tial re­sults was in a neck-and-neck race with Demo­crat Joe Bi­den. “So we’ll be go­ing to the US Supreme Court. We want all vot­ing to stop.”</p>
    <p>He ap­peared to mean stop­ping the count­ing of mail-in bal­lots which can be legally ac­cepted by state election boards after Tues­day’s election, pro­vided they were sent in time.</p>
    <p>Later in a tweet, he al­leged there had been “sur­prise bal­lot dumps” in states where he had been leading Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“Last night I was leading, of­ten in­clud­ing solidly, in many key states, in al­most all in­stances Demo­crat-run and con­trolled,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“Then, one by one, they started to mag­i­cally dis­ap­pear as sur­prise bal­lot dumps were counted.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump did not of­fer any ev­i­dence for his al­le­ga­tion of “bal­lot dumps” and there have been no re­ports of any ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The leads in nu­mer­ous states had shifted back and forth be­tween the can­di­dates as votes were counted.</p>
    <p>Min­utes after Mr Trump’s White House speech, the As­so­ci­ated Press (AP) de­clared Mr Bi­den had won Ari­zona, a state Mr Trump won in 2016. It was the first state to flip in the election and greatly com­pli­cates the Pres­i­dent’s path to re­elec­tion. Mr Bi­den also won three of Maine’s four Elec­toral Col­lege votes, the AP said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Mr Bi­den said he felt good about his chances to win the pres­i­dency, cau­tion­ing sup­port­ers that it would take time to fin­ish count­ing the votes.</p>
    <p>“We knew this was gonna go long,” the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent told sup­port­ers in cars out­side the Chase Cen­tre in his home­town of Wilmington, Delaware, after he took to the out­door stage while hold­ing the hand of his wife Jill.</p>
    <p>“But, look, we feel good about where we are. We re­ally do. I’m here to tell you tonight we be­lieve we’re on track to win this election,” said Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic nom­i­nee was on stage for just a few min­utes in a de­cid­edly low-key af­fair that echoed many of his cam­paign events.</p>
    <p>“We knew be­cause of the mail-in vot­ing this would take longer than usual,” said Mr Bi­den. “It ain’t over un­til ev­ery bal­lot is counted, ev­ery vote is counted.”</p>
    <p>“Keep the faith, guys. We’re gonna win this. Your pa­tience is great,” he added, to more cheers and honk­ing.</p>
    <p>Just as he con­cluded his re­marks, Mr Trump re­sponded in tweets.</p>
    <p>“We are up big, but they are try­ing to steal the election,” the Pres­i­dent wrote. “We will never let them do it. Votes can­not be cast after the Poles (sic) are closed!” Mr Trump wrote, ap­par­ently mis­spelling the word polls.</p>
    <p>Twitter swiftly tagged the tweet as pos­si­bly mis­lead­ing.</p>
    <p>“It’s not my place or Don­ald Trump’s place to de­clare the win­ner of this election. It’s the vot­ers’ place,” Mr Bi­den said on Twitter in re­sponse to the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>The only other Elec­toral Col­lege vote to flip so far, be­sides in Ari­zona, came from a con­gres­sional district in Ne­braska that backed Mr Bi­den after favour­ing Mr</p>
    <p>Trump in 2016.</p>
    <p>The AP, re­lied on by many news or­gan­i­sa­tions for election calls, said in a state­ment that it “is not call­ing the pres­i­den­tial race yet be­cause nei­ther can­di­date has se­cured the 270 Elec­toral Col­lege votes needed to claim vic­tory”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump won Florida, a cru­cial prize in the race to the White House that closed off Mr Bi­den’s hopes for an early knock­out in the election. The Pres­i­dent also won Texas, which Democrats had hoped might turn blue and en­tirely re­shape the elec­toral map.</p>
    <p>Ms Vir­ginia Hansen, a Bi­den sup­porter who at­tended the Wilmington rally, said she did not dare to yet dream of a Bi­den win, fear­ing dis­ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>“I’m with­hold­ing any hope for now,” said the 30-year-old.</p>
