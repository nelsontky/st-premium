    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia’s coro­n­avirus hot spot of Vic­to­ria state re­ported two new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day af­ter post­ing no in­fec­tions in the pre­vi­ous two days, as state cap­i­tal Mel­bourne emerged from three months-plus of a hard lock­down.</p>
    <p>Restau­rants and cafes in worsthit city Mel­bourne – home to five mil­lion peo­ple – re­opened from yes­ter­day and lim­its on so­cial gath­er­ings at home have been eased, al­low­ing two adults and de­pen­dants from one house to visit another house­hold.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne was put into lock­down in early July af­ter a sec­ond wave that pushed daily case num­bers to over 700 in early Au­gust.</p>
    <p>“Around 180,000 work­ers can re­turn to work on site. That is an achieve­ment that ev­ery sin­gle Vic­to­rian should be proud of,” the state’s Premier Daniel An­drews told a reg­u­lar me­dia brief­ing.</p>
    <p>“We all have to fol­low the rules, to pro­tect staff, to pro­tect cus­tomers, to pro­tect this frag­ile thing that we have built...So we can have the Christ­mas we have been look­ing for­ward to, with the peo­ple we have missed the most.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has recorded just over 27,500 in­fec­tions, far fewer than many other de­vel­oped coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria, the sec­ond-most pop­u­lous state, has ac­counted for more than 90 per cent of the coun­try’s 907 deaths. It re­ported t wo deaths in the past 24 hours.</p>
    <p>Still, with Vic­to­ria ac­count­ing for about a quar­ter of the na­tion’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, the re­stric­tions have deep­ened Aus­tralia’s first re­ces­sion in al­most 30 years.</p>
    <p>The l ock­down has slashed A$100 mil­lion (S$96.5 mil­lion) a day from eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and re­sulted in a daily av­er­age of 1,200 jobs be­ing lost through Au­gust and Septem­ber across the state, Mr Luke Yea­man, a Trea­sury depart­ment of­fi­cial, told a par­lia­men­tary panel this week.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness lead­ers say it may take years for Mel­bourne to re­cover.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne chef Scott Pick­ett warned that on­go­ing ca­pac­ity re­stric­tions would con­tinue to hit restau­rants and cafes and that many eater­ies would fold once gov­ern­ment wage sub­si­dies end early next year.</p>
    <p>“Some may get to Christ­mas, Jan­uary and say they can’t do this any­more,” said Mr Pick­ett, who owns the bistro Estelle. “It’s go­ing to be a blood­bath out there at some stage.”</p>
    <p>The so­cial costs are also mount­ing. The Royal Aus­tralian Col­lege of Gen­eral Prac­ti­tion­ers said de­mand for health ser­vices na­tion­wide has risen by 15 per cent since early March, and by 31 per cent be­tween Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber in Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>Al­co­hol con­sump­tion has risen and do­mes­tic vi­o­lence spiked.</p>
    <p>“Only be­ing al­lowed out­side for an hour a day was aw­ful,” said Ms Tessa Pa­trao, 27, who is fi­nally back at work as a pri­mary school teacher af­ter the 112-day stay-at-home order.</p>
    <p>While govern­ments in the United King­dom, Italy and Ger­many have faced protests against sec­ond lock­downs, Vic­to­ri­ans have been largely com­pli­ant. That’s in part down to the pop­u­lar­ity of the state’s La­bor gov­ern­ment, which won the 2018 elec­tion by a land­slide, and the high ap­proval rat­ings of Premier An­drews.</p>
    <p>The car­rot-and-stick ap­proach taken by the au­thor­i­ties has also helped, with A$1,500 pay­ments for peo­ple who could not af­ford to self­iso­late and court-im­posed fines of as much as A$20,000 for re­peat breaches of iso­la­tion or­ders.</p>
    <p>“It would’ve been im­pos­si­ble to mean­ing­fully po­lice if there wasn’t com­mu­nity sup­port,” said Dr Terry Slevin, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the Pub­lic Health As­so­ci­a­tion of Aus­tralia. “It’s an ex­am­ple where a com­pact be­tween a gov­ern­ment and a com­mu­nity that’s been driven by ex­pert ad­vice has achieved a valu­able pub­lic health out­come.”</p>
