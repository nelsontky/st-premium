    <p>A for­mer di­rec­tor of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) East Asian In­sti­tute (EAI) has de­nied all claims of sex­ual ha­rass­ment lev­elled against him by his for­mer staff, as the univer­sity con­tin­ues to in­ves­ti­gate the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple ha­rass­ment claims had ap­peared on so­cial me­dia in the past month, with at least two users – who iden­ti­fied them­selves as NUS or EAI staff – ac­cus­ing Pro­fes­sor Zheng Yong­nian of sex­ual ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Prof Zheng “cat­e­gor­i­cally de­nies” all such al­le­ga­tions, whether by EAI staff or any other per­sons, his lawyers said in a state­ment on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>They also said that the pro­fes­sor’s res­ig­na­tion from the univer­sity and EAI was un­re­lated to the al­le­ga­tions and com­plaint against him. In­stead, they said he had ac­cepted a new post that “al­lows him to fo­cus more on re­search as a scholar, where his pas­sions lie”.</p>
    <p>The 58-year-old pro­fes­sor is un­der­stood to have joined the Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong, Shen­zhen, as the head of its Ad­vanced In­sti­tute of Global and Con­tem­po­rary China Stud­ies by late last month.</p>
    <p>The al­le­ga­tions ap­peared on so­cial me­dia ear­lier that month.</p>
    <p>In posts on Twit­ter, a user who iden­ti­fied her­self as a cur­rent EAI staff mem­ber said she had filed a po­lice re­port in May last year af­ter be­ing sex­u­ally ha­rassed by Prof Zheng in May 2018. She also said that she was sub­se­quently bul­lied by in­sti­tute staff when she lodged a com­plaint with the univer­sity.</p>
    <p>The po­lice and an NUS spokesman con­firmed that a re­port was lodged. The po­lice said they ad­min­is­tered a stern warn­ing for out­rage of mod­esty in April in the case and this was done in con­sul­ta­tion with the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers.</p>
    <p>The NUS spokesman said the univer­sity fol­lowed up on the case with an in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>The spokesman also added NUS found that another staff mem­ber had filed a po­lice re­port against Prof Zheng over an in­ci­dent in 2012. That staff mem­ber did not lodge a com­plaint re­gard­ing Prof Zheng with the in­sti­tute, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>“All al­le­ga­tions of sex­ual mis­con­duct are taken se­ri­ously and in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are con­ducted to look into al­le­ga­tions with pri­or­ity,” said the spokesman, adding that NUS pays spe­cial at­ten­tion to af­fected staff and will not tol­er­ate any bul­ly­ing.</p>
    <p>The for­mer staff mem­ber who said she was sex­u­ally ha­rassed by Prof Zheng in 2012 told The Sun­day Times yes­ter­day that she made the po­lice re­port only this year af­ter learn­ing that another col­league had “suf­fered from Prof Zheng’s sex­ual ha­rass­ment”.</p>
    <p>“Zheng sex­u­ally ha­rassed me a long time ago, so it took ex­tra ef­fort (for me) to pro­ceed,” said the woman, who re­quested anonymity.</p>
    <p>She said that Prof Zheng had touched her in­ap­pro­pri­ately in a ho­tel lift, when no one else was present, in 2012.</p>
    <p>“I dared not tell for fear of re­tal­i­a­tion,” she said, adding that she left the in­sti­tute in July this year.</p>
    <p>The NUS spokesman said this case was closed by the po­lice with­out any fur­ther ac­tion and the staff mem­ber left af­ter her con­tract ex­pired.</p>
    <p>In the press state­ment on Fri­day, Prof Zheng’s lawyers said that the warn­ing is­sued by the po­lice to their client “does not amount to a pro­nounce­ment of guilt or find­ing of fact”.</p>
    <p>“Pro­fes­sor Zheng has lent and con­tin­ues to lend his ut­most co­op­er­a­tion in the on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions by NUS. As the out­come is presently pend­ing, it is not ap­pro­pri­ate at this junc­ture to com­ment fur­ther,” said the lawyers.</p>
    <p>They added that the pro­fes­sor is “presently con­sid­er­ing his le­gal op­tions”.</p>
