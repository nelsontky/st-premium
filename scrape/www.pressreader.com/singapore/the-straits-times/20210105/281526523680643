    <p>Pri­vate home prices de­fied the pan­demic-in­duced re­ces­sion to rise again in the fi­nal three months of 2020 – the third con­sec­u­tive quar­ter of in­crease.</p>
    <p>The price in­dex climbed 2.1 per cent in the fi­nal three months of last year, well ahead of the 0.8 per cent in­crease in the third quar­ter, noted Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity flash es­ti­mates yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This was the steep­est quar­terly in­crease since the sec­ond quar­ter of 2018, when pri­vate home prices rose 3.4 per cent be­fore cool­ing mea­sures hit in July that year.</p>
    <p>The big­ger pic­ture was not so ro­bust with pri­vate home prices in­creas­ing 2.2 per cent for 2020, less than the 2.7 per cent gain in 2019.</p>
    <p>The fourth-quar­ter in­crease was driven mainly by homes in the rest of cen­tral re­gion, where val­ues rose 4.8 per cent, and the core cen­tral re­gion, up 3.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Prices in the out­side cen­tral re­gion ad­vanced 1.7 per cent, the same as the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The rest of cen­tral re­gion led the way last year as a whole, with prices up 5.1 per cent, fol­lowed by the out­side cen­tral re­gion at 3.1 per cent, while val­ues in the prime core cen­tral re­gion fell 0.2 per cent com­pared with 2019.</p>
    <p>Some new project launches in the fourth quar­ter could have boosted prices, said Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie.</p>
    <p>The me­dian price of new units was $2,137 per square foot (psf) at The Land­mark near Ou­tram Park MRT sta­tion, and $2,171 psf at The Linq@Beauty World in Up­per Bukit Timah, both well above the $1,813 psf me­dian price for all new</p>
    <p>con­do­minium units in the rest of cen­tral re­gion last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun noted that prices have also in­creased at many condo projects, such as Trea­sure at Tampines, Jadescape and Forett at Bukit Timah.</p>
    <p>She ex­pects over­all pri­vate home prices to rise by 1 per cent to 4 per cent this year, while prices at new projects could in­crease from 2 per cent to 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Buyer sen­ti­ment may pick up fur­ther on the grow­ing vac­cine op­ti­mism and phase three re­open­ing. A num­ber of block­buster launches could be re­leased in the lux­ury and city fringe ar­eas, which may up­lift the over­all price in­dex,” Ms Sun noted.</p>
    <p>Ms Tri­cia Song, Col­liers In­ter­na­tional’s re­search head for Sin­ga­pore, said de­vel­op­ers sold 2,381 new pri­vate homes – ex­clud­ing ex­ec­u­tive con­dos – in the last three months of 2020, down 32.3 per cent from the third quar­ter and a mar­ginal 2.5 per cent de­cline year on year.</p>
    <p>This should bring full-year new sales to 9,760 units, down 1.5 per cent from 9,912 in 2019, she added.</p>
    <p>Sales in the sec­ondary mar­ket were more re­silient in the fourth quar­ter, down just 5.6 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter but up 36.9 per cent year on year. This brought full-year sec­ondary sales to 9,905 units, up 7.2 per cent from 9,238 in 2019, said Ms Song.</p>
    <p>Hut­tons Asia re­search head Lee Sze Teck said up to 20 new launches can be ex­pected in the first quar­ter of this year, with around 9,000 new units hit­ting the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“Sell­ing prices are ex­pected to edge up be­cause of re­cent firm land ten­der prices and higher con­struc­tion costs be­cause of Covid-19 safety man­age­ment mea­sures,” he said.</p>
    <p>The me­dian price of new units was $2,137 per square foot (psf) at The Land­mark near Ou­tram Park MRT sta­tion, and $2,171 psf at The Linq@Beauty World in Up­per Bukit Timah, both well above the $1,813 psf me­dian price for all new con­do­minium units in the rest of cen­tral re­gion last year.</p>
