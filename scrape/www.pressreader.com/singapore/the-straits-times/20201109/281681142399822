    <p>The de­sire for greater po­lit­i­cal di­ver­sity and more checks and balances – clearly felt dur­ing the re­cent gen­eral election – is here to stay in Sin­ga­pore, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quent gen­eral elec­tions will only get tougher for the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP), as the op­po­si­tion will seek to deny it a twothirds ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment, and there­after, to dis­place it and form the govern­ment, added Mr Heng, who is the rul­ing party’s first as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral, yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The PAP won 83 out of the 93 seats in Par­lia­ment with just over 61 per cent of the pop­u­lar vote, in the lower range of its pro­jec­tions, and lost the newly formed Sengkang GRC to the Work­ers’ Party.</p>
    <p>In a vir­tual ad­dress to party cadres at the PAP’s bi­en­nial con­fer­ence, Mr Heng said the party must earn the right to lead, and urged them to be alert to what is at stake.</p>
    <p>Sharper con­tes­ta­tion can eas­ily spiral into un­sta­ble and di­vided pol­i­tics, he warned. While the po­lar­i­sa­tion seen else­where has not taken root in Sin­ga­pore, it is not im­mune to such pres­sures, he added, cit­ing how anti-for­eigner sen­ti­ments can be eas­ily stirred up.</p>
    <p>Race, reli­gion and in­equal­ity are other fault lines that can greatly di­vide Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety, he said, call­ing on the PAP to do what it can to re­sist such pres­sures. “In a tur­bu­lent and un­cer­tain fu­ture, the PAP will need to work even harder to build con­sen­sus and cre­ate the po­lit­i­cal space for us to do the right thing for Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing after Mr Heng, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said vot­ers had sent an “un­equiv­o­cal sig­nal” that they wanted the PAP back in power to see Sin­ga­pore through the chal­lenges ahead, even as they felt the pain of the down­turn and wanted more al­ter­na­tive voices to check the Govern­ment.</p>
    <p>The PAP will act on feed­back given by ac­tivists on its cam­paign, he said, stress­ing that the party must have the back­bone and con­vic­tion to fight for its be­liefs as po­lit­i­cal com­pe­ti­tion in­ten­si­fies.</p>
    <p>He added that the party will not give up in op­po­si­tion-held con­stituen­cies: “We will main­tain our pres­ence. We will strive to win back the vot­ers there – and one day, we will suc­ceed.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng out­lined three ways the party will evolve to en­gage a chang­ing elec­torate – by strength­en­ing its ground en­gage­ment, im­prov­ing its on­line out­reach and grow­ing its base of ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>The PAP must con­tinue to re­cruit widely so that its MPs and ac­tivists can rep­re­sent the grow­ing di­ver­sity of so­ci­ety, he added. “As a broad tent that oc­cu­pies the mid­dle ground, the PAP can bet­ter or­gan­ise our­selves to cham­pion the con­cerns of var­i­ous groups.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee said there is no sub­sti­tute for the hard, pa­tient work of reach­ing out to peo­ple, solv­ing their prob­lems, and win­ning their trust and con­fi­dence. But even as the party con­tin­ues its ground­work, it must not ne­glect the po­lit­i­cal con­test which has be­come more in­tense in the new nor­mal, he added.</p>
    <p>To this end, the PAP must work harder to trans­late pro­grammes and poli­cies that ben­e­fit Sin­ga­pore­ans into mes­sages peo­ple will em­brace, he said. It must also be ready to face closer scru­tiny, both in and out of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“Where the crit­i­cisms are fair and the sug­ges­tions are con­struc­tive, we will take them in, and im­prove our poli­cies and per­for­mance,” he said. “But we should also de­fend vig­or­ously what we be­lieve in and stand for, take the fight to the op­po­si­tion, and per­suade Sin­ga­pore­ans of the best way for­ward.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee added: “You may feel des­per­ate, your back may be to the wall – you be­lieve in it, stand for it, fight for it. If need be, die for it.”</p>
