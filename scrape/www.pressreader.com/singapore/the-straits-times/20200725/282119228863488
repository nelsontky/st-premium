    <p>The par­ents of a boy, who was seven when he was se­verely dis­abled in a swim­ming pool ac­ci­dent in 2015, have set­tled their law­suit against the Civil Ser­vice Club for an undisclose­d sum.</p>
    <p>They had ini­tially sued the club, which op­er­ates the premises in Bukit Ba­tok, for more than $2.5 mil­lion for the med­i­cal and fu­ture care costs of the boy.</p>
    <p>The set­tle­ment was ap­proved by the High Court ear­lier this month af­ter the club ac­cepted 75 per cent li­a­bil­ity for the neg­li­gence claim made last year.</p>
    <p>Pri­mary school pupil Syahriz Matin Ab­dul Halim suf­fered a lack of oxy­gen to his brain when he nearly drowned in the pool on Oct 11, 2015. As a re­sult, he lost his mo­tor skills and abil­ity to speak as well as sus­tained cor­ti­cal blind­ness.</p>
    <p>He spent three months at KK Women’s & Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal and when he re­turned home, he had to be tube-fed and use a wheel­chair.</p>
    <p>The club and a life­guard at the pool were sued and they in turn named the boy’s par­ents, Mr Ab­dul Halim Ab­dul Aziz and Madam Noraini Ab­dul Rah­man, as third par­ties. This means the court could ap­por­tion li­a­bil­ity to the par­ents in ad­di­tion to the de­fen­dants, if they were found li­able.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the court-ap­proved set­tle­ment, pro­ceed­ings against the par­ents were dropped by con­sent.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Halim on Wed­nes­day: “This whole case has been lifechang­ing for my wife and me and our other kids.”</p>
    <p>Hardly a day went by, in the past five years, when he did not feel an­guish or anx­i­ety as he waited for the court trial while tak­ing care of Syahriz, the 43-year-old tech­ni­cian told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Syahriz weighed 20kg five years ago. To­day, at age 12, he weighs 38kg and his care­giv­ing needs have in­creased too, said Mr Halim.</p>
    <p>“I am grate­ful the case is closed and we can move on,” he added, ex­press­ing grat­i­tude to his lawyers Viviene Sandhu and Jas­mine Dha­naraj from Clif­ford Law for their help and ad­vice. He said the agreed sum was confidenti­al.</p>
    <p>The de­fen­dants, rep­re­sented by the club’s in­sur­ance lawyers Ed­wina Fan and Ab­dul Salim Ahmed Ibrahim from United Le­gal Al­liance, had dis­puted the ini­tial claim.</p>
    <p>Syahriz’s move­ments have im­proved over the years, from “zero to some 20 per cent” with help from a ther­apy school, a trained nurse and sub­sidised medicine, said Mr Halim. He can now move his eye­balls and breathe with­out need­ing to be tubed in the nose.</p>
    <p>Putting him in a nurs­ing home is out of the ques­tion, said Madam Noraini, a mother of four. “Our par­ents brought us up, so we do the same with our chil­dren.”</p>
    <p>The 38-year-old gave up her job as an ad­min­is­tra­tive em­ployee to care for Syahriz, with the help of a live-in trained nurse. Daily, he at­tends AWWA School, a spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion school in Lorong Napiri in Hougang for chil­dren with mul­ti­ple dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>At home, his mother, with the help of the nurse, puts him through a mild daily work­out in a spe­cial needs gym the fam­ily set up in their liv­ing room.</p>
    <p>Said Madam Noraini: “He is more alert now, there is head con­trol, mus­cle move­ments, he can swal­low, stick out his tongue, spit out and make sounds be­cause of the im­proved mus­cle tone.</p>
    <p>“He is also able to laugh un­til he tears, some­thing he did not do be­fore.”</p>
    <p>GRATE­FUL FOR CLO­SURE</p>
    <p>This whole case has been life-chang­ing for my wife and me and our other kids... I am grate­ful the case is closed and we can ’’ move on.</p>
    <p>MR AB­DUL HALIM AB­DUL AZIZ, on set­tling the law­suit against the Civil Ser­vice Club re­gard­ing his son’s ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>SON’S CON­DI­TION HAS IM­PROVED</p>
    <p>Our par­ents brought us up, so we do the same with our chil­dren... He is more alert now... He is also able to laugh un­til he tears, some­thing he did not do ’’ be­fore.</p>
    <p>MADAM NORAINI AB­DUL RAH­MAN, who said that putting her son Syahriz in a nurs­ing home is out of the ques­tion.</p>
