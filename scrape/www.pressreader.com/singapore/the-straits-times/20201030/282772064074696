    <p>The idea of a mask that will not choke you while run­ning in­trigues me.</p>
    <p>But be­cause my scar­ily un­fit self can­not walk up a flight of stairs with­out wheez­ing, I en­listed free­lance fit­ness trainer Sa­muel Tan (@samueltgk), 23, to do the dirty work for me and re­view the Asics Run­ners Face Cover ($55, above).</p>
    <p>When we re­con­vened, Mr Tan has tried it thor­oughly. The good sport wore it dur­ing a steady jog, high-in­ten­sity runs and even body­weight work­outs.</p>
    <p>“As a first-timer wear­ing a mask to jog, the Asics mask felt very com­fort­able and non-ex­is­tent,” he tells me. “It fits just right on my face and the ad­justable straps at the back made it easy to wear. The mask is made from mesh that en­ables it to hold its shape even af­ter count­less hand-wash­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a fact sheet, strate­gi­cally placed air vents on this face cover cre­ated specif­i­cally for run­ners pro­vide un­ob­structed air­flow while pre­vent­ing the spread of droplets.</p>
    <p>The mask’s curved de­sign, said to cre­ate more room in­side for eas­ier breath­ing when run­ning, achieves its de­sired out­come with this keen re­viewer.</p>
    <p>“What I like about this mask is the fact that I was able to breathe com­fort­ably while run­ning. There is a space be­tween the in­ner wall of the mask and my face, so it doesn’t trap heat from all the con­stant ex­hal­ing,” Mr Tan says.</p>
    <p>To my scep­ti­cism, he replies: “I didn’t feel suf­fo­cated dur­ing the run as there was plenty of breath­ing space – it doesn’t stick to your face while you breathe. I ran for 5km and never once felt that I was un­able to breathe prop­erly.”</p>
    <p>And would he wear it again in fu­ture work­outs? “Def­i­nitely – for any form of work­out.”</p>
    <p>Well, all right then.</p>
