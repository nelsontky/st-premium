    <p>JALAL­ABAD (Afghanista­n) • More than 300 pris­on­ers were at large yes­ter­day af­ter an at­tack by Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) mil­i­tants on an Afghan pri­son, the gov­er­nor’s spokesman said, as clashes con­tin­ued be­tween pris­on­ers and se­cu­rity forces.</p>
    <p>The as­sault on the jail in the eastern city of Jalal­abad be­gan on Sun­day night, with at least 29 peo­ple killed and more than 50 hurt, ac­cord­ing to Mr At­taullah Khugyani, spokesman for the gov­er­nor of Nan­garhar prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Jalal­abad is the pro­vin­cial cap­i­tal of Nan­garhar, and the pri­son held Tale­ban and ISIS mil­i­tants, along with or­di­nary crim­i­nals.</p>
    <p>Of the 1,793 pris­on­ers, over 1,025 had tried to es­cape and been re­cap­tured, while 430 had re­mained in­side the pri­son.</p>
    <p>“The rest are miss­ing,” he said. He also said civil­ians, pris­on­ers and mem­bers of se­cu­rity forces were among the vic­tims. “Eight gun­men were killed as some ar­eas, where the at­tack­ers had taken po­si­tions, were cleared,” he said.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day evening, a car bomb was det­o­nated at the en­trance to the pri­son, and there were nu­mer­ous other blasts heard as the ISIS gun­men opened fire on se­cu­rity guards.</p>
    <p>About 30 mil­i­tants were i nvolved in the at­tack on the pri­son, ac­cord­ing to l aw­maker Sohrab Qaderi in Jalal­abad.</p>
    <p>Afghan spe­cial forces also ar­rived to sup­port po­lice, and civil­ians were be­ing evac­u­ated from ar­eas sur­round­ing the pri­son.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the city was in lock­down.</p>
    <p>ISIS has claimed re­spon­si­bil­ity for the at­tack, which came a day af­ter the Afghan in­tel­li­gence agency said spe­cial forces had killed a se­nior com­man­der of the group near Jalal­abad.</p>
