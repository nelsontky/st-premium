    <p>Mr Tan Chuan-Jin will be nom­i­nated for re-elec­tion as Speaker of Par­lia­ment when the House meets next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice (PMO) In­dra­nee Ra­jah will be des­ig­nated Leader of the House, and Se­nior Min­is­ter of State Zaqy Mo­hamad as Deputy Leader.</p>
    <p>These plans were an­nounced yes­ter­day by the PMO, which also re­leased the text of a let­ter Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong wrote to the Clerk of Par­lia­ment on these posts ahead of the open­ing of the 14th Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee takes over the post of Leader from Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu, who has held it since Oc­to­ber 2015. Ms In­dra­nee, who is Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, will be the sec­ond woman to hold the of­fice after Ms Fu.</p>
    <p>She was Deputy Speaker from 2006 to 2011.</p>
    <p>As Leader of the House, she will be in charge of co­or­di­nat­ing and man­ag­ing the Gov­ern­ment’s par­lia­men­tary busi­ness.</p>
    <p>She will be as­sisted by Mr Zaqy, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Man­power and De­fence, who will take over as Deputy Leader from Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Des­mond Lee. Mr Lee has held the post since Oc­to­ber 2015.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee said in a Face­book post after the an­nounce­ment that the po­si­tion comes with heavy re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, and she will do her ut­most to dis­charge them well.</p>
    <p>“I am con­scious that this comes at a time when our coun­try is fac­ing se­vere chal­lenges with Covid-19 with a grave eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion and so­cial stresses,” she said.</p>
    <p>“What we say and do in Par­lia­ment mat­ters – to our lives, our jobs and our fu­ture. It is not only Sin­ga­pore­ans who will be look­ing to see what hap­pens in the Cham­ber, but other coun­tries too.”</p>
    <p>She noted that the role in­volves work­ing closely with Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party Whip Janil Puthuc­heary, who was reap­pointed to the role on Wed­nes­day, as well as Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh, and she looked for­ward to work­ing with them.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Zaqy said he was thank­ful for the op­por­tu­nity to serve as Deputy Leader, adding: “In a pe­riod where we face tough chal­lenges for the coun­try and our peo­ple, I look for­ward to the de­bates and leg­isla­tive busi­ness ahead, as we wel­come new MPs and vet­eran MPs back too, who will set the tone and colour for this term of Par­lia­ment.”</p>
    <p>The cur­rent Speaker, Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, was first elected to the post by MPs on Sept 11, 2017, after Madam Hal­imah Ya­cob re­lin­quished it to run for the pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>The Speaker pre­sides over all sit­tings of Par­lia­ment and does not take part in de­bates, but can ab­stain or vote for or against a mo­tion if he has an orig­i­nal vote as an elected mem­ber.</p>
    <p>He also acts as the rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the House in its deal­ings with other Par­lia­ments and out­side bod­ies, wel­comes visit­ing dig­ni­taries and rep­re­sents Par­lia­ment at na­tional events.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post, Mr Tan thanked PM Lee for his con­fi­dence and for propos­ing his re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>He added: “Of course, I’d have to await the de­ci­sion of my par­lia­men­tary col­leagues. If cho­sen, I will con­tinue to be fair and im­par­tial, and firm, in dis­charg­ing my re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and up­hold­ing the hon­our and in­tegrity of our Par­lia­ment.”</p>
    <p>The open­ing of a new Par­lia­ment fol­low­ing a gen­eral elec­tion tra­di­tion­ally be­gins with the elec­tion of the Speaker by MPs in the af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>The MPs then take their oaths of al­le­giance, and Pres­i­dent Hal­imah is sched­uled to de­liver her ad­dress on Mon­day at 8pm.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress will set out the agenda and plans of the Gov­ern­ment for its five-year term.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment will then ad­journ till the fol­low­ing week, when MPs will de­bate the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong has said he will also make a ma­jor speech dur­ing the de­bate.</p>
