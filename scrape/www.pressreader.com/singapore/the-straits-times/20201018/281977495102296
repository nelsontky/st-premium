    <p>GU­JRAN­WALA/LA­HORE (Pak­istan) • Former Pak­istani prime min­is­ter Nawaz Sharif yes­ter­day ac­cused the coun­try’s army chief, Gen­eral Qa­mar Javed Ba­jwa, of top­pling his govern­ment, pres­sur­ing the ju­di­ciary and in­stalling the cur­rent govern­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Im­ran Khan in the 2018 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Sharif was speak­ing via video link from Lon­don to a gath­er­ing of tens of thou­sands of peo­ple that was or­gan­ised by op­po­si­tion par­ties to kick off a coun­try­wide protest cam­paign in the east­ern city of Gu­jran­wala, aimed at oust­ing Mr Khan’s govern­ment.</p>
    <p>“Gen Qa­mar Javed Ba­jwa, you packed up our govern­ment, which was work­ing well, and put the na­tion and the coun­try at the al­tar of your wishes,” Mr Sharif told the gath­er­ing – the largest since the 2018 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>He also ac­cused the chief of Pak­istan’s In­ter-Ser­vices In­tel­li­gence spy agency of be­ing in­volved in con­spir­ing against his govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Nine ma­jor op­po­si­tion par­ties formed a joint plat­form called the Pak­istan Demo­cratic Move­ment last month to be­gin na­tion­wide ag­i­ta­tion against the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Sharif, whose Pak­istan Mus­lim League-Nawaz is the main op­po­si­tion party, was sacked by the Supreme Court in 2017 on cor­rup­tion charges.</p>
    <p>He left for Lon­don last Novem­ber for med­i­cal treat­ment.</p>
    <p>He blames gen­er­als and judges for what he says were trumped-up charges.</p>
    <p>Pak­istan’s pow­er­ful mil­i­tary de­nies med­dling in pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Ms Maryam Nawaz, the daugh­ter and po­lit­i­cal heir of Mr Sharif, and Mr Bi­lawal Bhutto, who heads the Pak­istan Peo­ples Party and is the son of as­sas­si­nated former prime min­is­ter Be­nazir Bhutto, also ad­dressed the gath­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Both crit­i­cised the Khan govern­ment for what they called bad gov­er­nance and mis­man­age­ment of an econ­omy that is grow­ing at a neg­a­tive rate with an in­fla­tion touch­ing dou­ble dig­its.</p>
    <p>The next gen­eral elec­tion sched­uled for 2023.</p>
    <p>Mr Khan, who came to power on an anti-graft plat­form, said on Fri­day that he was not afraid of the op­po­si­tion’s cam­paign. is</p>
