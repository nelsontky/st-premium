    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON The US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) is­sued new guide­lines on Fri­day, say­ing peo­ple who have had close con­tacts with some­one with a coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion need a test, even if they do not have symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The change came af­ter a con­tro­versy in late Au­gust, when the agency sug­gested those peo­ple did not need Covid-19 screen­ings.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who do not have symp­toms and are not close con­tacts of an in­fected per­son still do not need a screen­ing, un­less it is rec­om­mended by a med­i­cal provider or pub­lic health of­fi­cial, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est CDC state­ment.</p>
    <p>The Au­gust shift on test­ing asymp­to­matic in­di­vid­u­als had said test­ing might not be needed for asymp­to­matic close con­tacts. It was slammed by pub­lic health ex­perts, who said it could re­duce the amount of test­ing per­formed in the US.</p>
    <p>Mr Brett Giroir, a top Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial over­see­ing the test­ing, de­fended the change in a brief­ing last month as in­tended to il­lus­trate the lim­i­ta­tions of the virus screen­ings and said the new guide­lines were “a CDC ac­tion”.</p>
    <p>But the New York Times re­ported on Thurs­day the guide­lines were rewrit­ten by the De­part­ment of Health and Hu­man Services (HHS) and re­leased in spite of CDC sci­en­tists’ op­po­si­tion. The test­ing guide­lines re­leased on Fri­day were changed by HHS and did not go through the CDC’s typ­i­cal re­view, ac­cord­ing to the Times re­port.</p>
    <p>HHS and CDC did not im­me­di­ately re­turn re­quests for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health ex­perts have ad­vo­cated mass test­ing as a means of iden­ti­fy­ing virus cases and pre­vent­ing fur­ther spread, but the US has yet to achieve a sys­tem of widespread, easyto-access, quick-turn­around screen­ings. While avail­abil­ity of test­ing for peo­ple with symp­toms has i mproved sig­nif­i­cantly over the course of the pan­demic, those with­out symp­toms can still face bar­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts are wor­ried the CDC guid­ance, which ap­plied to both asymp­to­matic close con­tacts as well as those who at­tended large, risky gath­er­ings but had no symp­toms, would ex­ac­er­bate those chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the new rec­om­men­da­tions, those who are in an area of high virus trans­mis­sion and go to a large gath­er­ing with spotty pub­lic health pre­cau­tions may be ad­vised to get a Covid-19 test by their doc­tor or a pub­lic health of­fi­cial.</p>
