    <p>With most of our wild fish stocks be­ing se­verely over-fished, up to two-thirds of our seafood are likely to be farmed by 2030.</p>
    <p>To in­ten­sify seafood pro­duc­tion and meet Sin­ga­pore’s “30 by 30” goal, the state has turned to fish farms that em­ploy tech­nol­ogy to in­ten­sify their food pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>One such high-tech farm is the Eco-Ark, whose au­to­mated and closed na­ture shields it from fluc­tu­at­ing ex­ter­nal con­di­tions and prom­ises a more ef­fi­cient and re­silient pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>By pre­vent­ing dis­eased or ge­net­i­cally dis­tinct farmed fish from es­cap­ing, the tech­nol­ogy boasts a lower en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact. Its com­plex in-built fil­tra­tion sys­tem also re­duces un­treated waste.</p>
    <p>How­ever, un­less al­ter­na­tive fish feeds are sourced, the ex­pan­sion of any fish farm is de­pen­dent on fur­ther de­plet­ing wild fish stocks. In­stead of be­ing di­rectly used for hu­man con­sump­tion, 70 per cent of wild-caught for­age fish such as sar­dines are con­verted into fish feed for big­ger and tastier farmed fish such as salmon and cod. Valu­able pro­tein is wasted in the process.</p>
    <p>More­over, as the in­dus­try calls for greater yields over a smaller land area, farmed fish live in in­creas­ingly cramped and stress­ful con­di­tions. Such fish be­come more sus­cep­ti­ble to dis­ease and dy­ing.</p>
    <p>Any pathogen present among the ex­ist­ing farmed fish can still pro­lif­er­ate, re­quir­ing the use of ad­di­tional med­i­ca­tions. How­ever, the wide­spread in­dus­try use of an­tibi­otics has ren­dered our an­tibi­otics less ef­fec­tive due to ris­ing an­timi­cro­bial re­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>But let’s also fairly con­sider de­vel­op­ments that can ren­der the high-tech pro­duc­tion more sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>The use of black soldier fly lar­vae as an al­ter­na­tive fish feed can also re­duce the de­pen­dence and im­pact of the aqua­cul­ture in­dus­try on de­plet­ing fish stocks.</p>
    <p>The in­tro­duc­tion of plants into the pro­duc­tion also serves as a more eco­log­i­cal ap­proach. Also known as aquapon­ics, sea­weeds and salt-re­sis­tant crops such as the sea purslane can be grown along­side farms to fur­ther re­move ex­cess fish waste while im­prov­ing food yields and diver­sity.</p>
    <p>In all, when work­ing to­wards our goal for greater food se­cu­rity, ac­count­ing for long-term sus­tain­abil­ity is im­por­tant too.</p>
