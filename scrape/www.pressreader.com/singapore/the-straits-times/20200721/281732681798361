    <p>MUM­BAI • In­dian po­lice have ar­rested 14 peo­ple on sus­pi­cion of sell­ing lo­cally made doses of Gilead Sciences’ remde­sivir at five times the max­i­mum re­tail price as a surge of coro­n­avirus cases boosts de­mand for the an­tivi­ral drug.</p>
    <p>Remde­sivir, which has been shown to trim hos­pi­tal re­cov­ery times in a US clin­i­cal trial, has been cleared by sev­eral coun­tries as a treat­ment against the dis­ease that has killed more than 600,000 peo­ple glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Gilead Sciences, which owns the pa­tent to the drug, has li­censed it to six In­dian drug­mak­ers, al­low­ing them to pro­duce generic ver­sions. But only lim­ited pro­duc­tion has be­gun.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s tally of coro­n­avirus cases has risen to 1.11 mil­lion, with more than 27,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Po­lice in the fi­nan­cial hub of Mum­bai and in the south­ern city of Hy­der­abad said they have ar­rested, in all, 14 peo­ple for sell­ing the drug on the black mar­ket for as much as 30,000 ru­pees (S$557) a dose, com­pared with the max­i­mum re­tail price of 5,400 ru­pees. Po­lice said they seized 23 vials of remde­sivir pro­duced by Ci­pla and pri­vately held In­dian drug­maker Hetero Labs from the sus­pects.</p>
    <p>The Food and Drug and Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) of the western state of Ma­ha­rash­tra, which has recorded more than 310,000 coro­n­avirus cases, has been try­ing to crack down on the black-mar­ket­ing of drugs with the help of lo­cal po­lice, the state’s FDA com­mis­sioner Arun Un­hale told Reuters.</p>
    <p>In­dia hit an­other record for new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, with 40,425 in­fec­tions re­ported dur­ing the past 24 hours across the coun­try, tak­ing to­tal cases to 1,118,043. This is the high­est sin­gle­day spike for new Covid-19 cases in the coun­try so far, and keeps In­dia as the third worst-hit na­tion be­hind the US and Brazil. An­other 681 deaths were re­ported, bring­ing to­tal fa­tal­i­ties to 27,497.</p>
    <p>As cases con­tinue to rise, hu­man tri­als of a vac­cine – Co­vaxin, de­vel­oped by Bharat Biotech – started at gov­ern­ment-run hos­pi­tal PGI Ro­htak in the north­ern state of Haryana last Fri­day.</p>
