    <p>Left alone with his el­derly fa­ther for three hours in their Be­dok North flat, an “un­sta­ble” un­em­ployed man al­legedly at­tacked the 75-year-old, who was later found ly­ing in a pool of blood.</p>
    <p>As paramedics at­tended to the vic­tim, the man, Tan Kok Meng, cov­ered in dried blood, sud­denly got up from the sofa where he had been sit­ting in a daze.</p>
    <p>Ig­nor­ing the pleas of the paramedics, he choked his fa­ther while mum­bling “I want him to die” in Man­darin for a minute or so, then went back to sit on the sofa.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim, Mr Tan Ah Hin, stopped breath­ing in the am­bu­lance and was pro­nounced dead at Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>The ac­count emerged in the High Court yes­ter­day as Tan went on trial on a charge of mur­der for the death of his fa­ther on Nov 13, 2015.</p>
    <p>Tan, 46, has put on weight since he was charged in 2015 and now has a head of grey hair.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion has ac­cused him of in­flict­ing mul­ti­ple blows on the vic­tim’s face and stran­gling him.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Daphne Lim told the court there is some ev­i­dence show­ing that Tan would qual­ify for the defence of un­sound­ness of mind.</p>
    <p>Two psy­chi­a­trists from the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health have di­ag­nosed him with schizophre­nia. One of them said Tan was also in a state of acute drug in­tox­i­ca­tion dur­ing the in­ci­dent as he had taken metham­phetamine then.</p>
    <p>The DPP sought an or­der for Tan to be de­tained at the Pres­i­dent’s plea­sure. This means that if the court finds that Tan had com­mit­ted the al­leged acts, he will be ac­quit­ted due to his men­tal in­ca­pac­ity but will be con­fined in a psy­chi­atric in­sti­tu­tion, prison or some other place of safe cus­tody.</p>
    <p>There is no min­i­mum pe­riod of de­ten­tion and the men­tal state of the de­tainee is re­viewed reg­u­larly un­til he is suit­able for dis­charge.</p>
    <p>Tan is de­fended by Mr Fa­vian Kang and Mr Ni­chol Yeo.</p>
    <p>The DPP told the court that on Nov 13, 2015, the younger Tan was not his usual self.</p>
    <p>His mother, Madam Toh Meow</p>
    <p>Siang, noted that he had been look­ing dazed for the pre­vi­ous two days and had been pac­ing up and down in the flat.</p>
    <p>To keep him from leav­ing the flat, Madam Toh kept the house keys from him. Be­fore she left the flat at about 2.30pm that day, she told her hus­band not to al­low their son to go out.</p>
    <p>About three hours later, she re­turned to find her hus­band breath­ing heav­ily, ly­ing in a pool of blood un­der his head. Tan, who was seated on the sofa, did not re­spond to her ques­tions.</p>
    <p>Madam Toh left the flat to get help from the neigh­bours and when she re­turned, she shouted at Tan, ask­ing why he had killed his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>Tan then walked over to the older man, sat on his ab­domen and placed his hands on his fa­ther’s up­per chest be­fore she pulled him away.</p>
    <p>The paramedics ar­rived soon af­ter. One of them, Ms Zaneta Lee, tes­ti­fied that while she was in­sert­ing a de­vice to clear the vic­tim’s air­way, Tan sud­denly started chok­ing his fa­ther.</p>
    <p>She said she shouted at Tan to stop but he ig­nored her. “We did not try to pull the ac­cused away as we were wor­ried for our safety. We did not know if he had a weapon.”</p>
    <p>Po­lice of­fi­cers ar­rived shortly af­ter and ar­rested Tan. He told them that he used his bare hands to at­tack his fa­ther, that they had a strained re­la­tion­ship and that the older man had called him “good for noth­ing”.</p>
    <p>An au­topsy found that the older Tan had died from stran­gu­la­tion and blood as­pi­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Foren­sic pathol­o­gist Teo Eng Swee said the main source of the blood was likely from a deep cut on the tongue, which was con­sis­tent with the vic­tim be­ing punched in the face.</p>
