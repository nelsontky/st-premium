    <p>While the vac­cine had elicited a “ro­bust” im­mune re­sponse to the Sars-CoV-2 virus with­out se­ri­ous ad­verse ef­fects in a phase one trial with</p>
    <p>216 par­tic­i­pants, re-en­gi­neer­ing a fix could take an­other 12 months... Biotech firm CSL and the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment to­gether de­cided to stop Phase 2 and 3 tri­als.</p>
    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia can­celled the pro­duc­tion of a lo­cally made vac­cine against Covid-19 af­ter tri­als showed that it could in­ter­fere with HIV di­ag­no­sis, with the gov­ern­ment in­stead se­cur­ing ad­di­tional doses of ri­val vac­cines.</p>
    <p>An­ti­bod­ies gen­er­ated by the vac­cine be­ing de­vel­oped by the Univer­sity of Queens­land (UQ) and biotech firm CSL, one of four can­di­dates con­tracted by the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment, were found to lead to some false pos­i­tive HIV test re­sults, the mak­ers said.</p>
    <p>While the vac­cine had elicited a “ro­bust” im­mune re­sponse to the Sars-CoV-2 virus with­out se­ri­ous ad­verse ef­fects in a Phase 1 trial with 216 par­tic­i­pants, re-en­gi­neer­ing a fix could take an­other 12 months, they said.</p>
    <p>CSL and the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment to­gether de­cided to stop Phase 2 and 3 tri­als.</p>
    <p>“While this is a tough de­ci­sion to take, the ur­gent need for a vac­cine has to be ev­ery­one’s pri­or­ity,” said UQ Pro­fes­sor Paul Young.</p>
    <p>CSL, which had a con­tract to pro­duce 51 mil­lion doses of the UQ vac­cine, will in­stead pro­duce an ex­tra 20 mil­lion doses of the Ox­ford Univer­sity vac­cine be­ing de­vel­oped with Bri­tain’s As­traZeneca, tak­ing the to­tal to 53 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment said it has also se­cured 11 mil­lion more doses of vac­cines from Amer­i­can com­pany No­vavax.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia also has a con­tract for 10 mil­lion doses of a vac­cine be­ing de­vel­oped by Pfizer, with reg­u­la­tory ap­proval ex­pected by next month.</p>
    <p>JP­Mor­gan an­a­lysts said that the can­cel­la­tion of the CSL con­tract re­moved an “im­por­tant” op­por­tu­nity for the vac­cine maker that would have brought it A$100 mil­lion (S$100.6 mil­lion) in ex­tra rev­enues.</p>
    <p>All in, Aus­tralia has se­cured 140 mil­lion vac­cine units to in­oc­u­late its 25 mil­lion peo­ple, one of the high­est ra­tios of vac­cine pur­chases to pop­u­la­tion in the world, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The can­cel­la­tion was an­nounced be­fore Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son’s fi­nal meet­ing this year with state and ter­ri­tory lead­ers in Can­berra – their first in-per­son meet­ing in nine months – to plan the vac­ci­na­tion roll-out and to de­velop sea­sonal visas for skilled work­ers and stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“We want to en­sure that Aus­tralians... have full con­fi­dence, ab­so­lute full con­fi­dence that when it gets the tick, they can get the jab and they can make that de­ci­sion for them­selves and for their fam­i­lies con­fi­dently,” Mr Mor­ri­son told re­porters.</p>
    <p>De­spite suf­fer­ing sig­nif­i­cant eco­nomic hits due to Covid-19, Aus­tralian con­sumer sen­ti­ment is climb­ing again as the coun­try reemerges from the pan­demic faster than most.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s tally of 28,000 Covid-19 in­fec­tions is far fewer than in many other de­vel­oped coun­tries, and with only spo­radic cases of the virus now show­ing up, it has not raced to start vac­ci­na­tions as in North Amer­ica and parts of Europe.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is sched­uled to start vac­ci­na­tions in March next year and ex­pects to in­oc­u­late its whole pop­u­la­tion by the end of the year.</p>
