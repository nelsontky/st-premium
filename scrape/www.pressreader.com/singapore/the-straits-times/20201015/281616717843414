    <p>The trust deficit be­tween Malaysians and their politi­cians have ap­par­ently grown wider, with yet an­other power strug­gle amid a wors­en­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents are brac­ing them­selves for an­other round of re­stric­tions as in­fec­tions surge in the af­ter­math of a re­cent state election.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, sev­eral peo­ple – all of whom were masked – car­ried a ban­ner in Malay that read “Rakyat menderita. Poli­tikus peduli apa?” (Peo­ple are suf­fer­ing. Do politi­cians even care?).</p>
    <p>They stood in front of six fed­eral gov­ern­ment build­ings and agen­cies, mov­ing from lo­ca­tion to lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The ac­tion by the group, which was posted on the Twit­ter feed of non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion Gerak Malaysia, fol­lows the ap­pear­ance of sev­eral ban­ners in other parts of the coun­try, crit­i­cis­ing politi­cians for their role in the re­cent resur­gence of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The spike in Covid-19 cases fol­lowed the Sabah state election on Sept 26.</p>
    <p>In the run-up to the polls, politi­cians de­scended on the state to cam­paign, even though there had been an out­break at one of its de­ten­tion cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Some of these politi­cians and state res­i­dents who went home to vote were found to be in­fected when they re­turned to the main­land.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Covid-19 num­bers hit new highs re­peat­edly since the end of the Sabah election, as a record 691 new cases were re­ported on Tues­day last week.</p>
    <p>The mount­ing num­bers prompted the fed­eral gov­ern­ment to im­pose par­tial lock­downs.</p>
    <p>From yes­ter­day, al­most a third of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion were af­fected – in Se­lan­gor, Kuala Lumpur, Pu­tra­jaya and Sabah.</p>
    <p>De­spite the wors­en­ing sit­u­a­tion, po­lit­i­cal tur­moil con­tin­ued to grip the coun­try, with op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim’s bid to be­come prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He met the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, on Tues­day and claimed that he now had the ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter the meet­ing, Umno, the big­gest party in the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion, threat­ened to pull out of it, throw­ing more doubt on the fu­ture of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>Many Malaysians were al­ready up­set with the politi­cians for push­ing for the Sabah state polls, and blamed the fresh re­stric­tions or the con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der (CMCO) on the coun­try’s lead­ers.</p>
    <p>CMCO and Umno started trend­ing on Twit­ter late Tues­day, amid wide­spread dis­dain.</p>
    <p>A Twit­ter user with the han­dle Steve Mak “thanked” the gov­ern­ment for “do­ing such a great job” in mess­ing up peo­ple’s lives.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter user Aymn Hzwani quipped that the peo­ple needed to be re­minded on how aw­ful the year had been for them.</p>
    <p>“Not be­cause of the pan­demic but be­cause of the in­com­pe­tence,” the user wrote.</p>
    <p>Like many oth­ers, Twit­ter user Sha­reen Hakim’s ire was aimed at Umno, say­ing: “Other than hard­core Umno, who is gonna work with or vote for Umno af­ter this.”</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts agreed that peo­ple were</p>
    <p>more con­cerned about the pan­demic than pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Bow­erGroupAsi­a direc­tor As­rul Hadi Ab­dul­lah Sani told The Straits Times: “I think it is not only dis­trust but also anger di­rected to­wards politi­cians who are blamed for the in­crease in Covid-19 cases, es­pe­cially with #Klus­terMen­teri (min­is­ters’ clus­ter) trend­ing on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>“Many al­ready feel that the politi</p>
    <p>cians are in their own po­lit­i­cal bub­ble and not in touch with the elec­torate.”</p>
    <p>He added that the peo­ple are more con­cerned with the pan­demic and how the lat­est re­stric­tions will af­fect their liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>Mr Shazwan Mustafa Ka­mal, a senior as­so­ciate at Vriens and Part­ners, a gov­ern­ment reg­u­la­tory af­fairs and po­lit­i­cal risk con­sul­tancy firm, said: “I think there’s grow­ing</p>
    <p>anger and dis­il­lu­sion­ment from some mem­bers of the public with re­gard to the po­lit­i­cal shenani­gans tak­ing place.”</p>
    <p>He added that on so­cial me­dia, there is a gen­eral sense of dis­ap­proval over the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion – of gov­ern­ment in­sta­bil­ity and Datuk Seri An­war’s planned takeover – and that the peo­ple want a gov­ern­ment that can show the way to deal with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Shazwan said there might be a very low turnout should Malaysia go to the polls soon.</p>
    <p>“Un­like Sin­ga­pore, the Sabah election has shown how lit­tle pre­pared Malaysia is for an election in a Covid-19 era,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din has pre­vi­ously hinted at a snap election should PN win the Sabah polls.</p>
