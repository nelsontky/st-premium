    <p>A new Sin­ga­pore brand mark, dubbed “Made With Pas­sion”, was launched yes­ter­day by the Gov­ern­ment to high­light the sto­ries be­hind lo­cal brands and en­cour­age con­sumers to pa­tro­n­ise them. For a start, close to 50 life­style brands – from fash­ion la­bels, to home­ware and decor, to pack­aged food – have been given the mark.</p>
    <p>Close to 50 es­tab­lished home­grown brands many Sin­ga­pore­ans have grown up with, as well as up-and-com­ing la­bels, have been of­fi­cially marked as “Made With Pas­sion”.</p>
    <p>Drinks maker Yeo’s and fash­ion la­bel Charles and Keith were among the first crop of lo­cal brands awarded this new na­tional brand mark, launched by the Sin­ga­pore Brand Of­fice and the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) yes­ter­day to pro­mote con­sumer aware­ness and ap­pre­ci­a­tion for Sin­ga­pore’s brands.</p>
    <p>“The Made With Pas­sion ini­tia­tive is a gate­way for Sin­ga­pore­ans to dis­cover more of our lo­cal brands,” said Ms Dilys Boey, as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive at En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, which sup­ports this cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The pi­o­neer batch of 48 brands rep­re­sents four life­style cat­e­gories – beauty and well­ness, fash­ion and ac­ces­sories, home­ware and decor, and pack­aged food and bev­er­ages.</p>
    <p>The brands will dis­play the Made With Pas­sion (MWP) logo on their prod­uct pack­ag­ing and col­lat­er­als, in­clud­ing those in­store and on­line.</p>
    <p>To kick things off, the brands will be show­cased on a Shopee mi­crosite un­til Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers can also dis­cover the sto­ries be­hind brands such as nuts and snacks com­pany Camel, beauty and well­ness firm Ki­no­him­itsu, as well as newer brands like gin maker Brass Lion Dis­tillery and home­ware la­bel Com­mune on MWP’s Face­book and In­sta­gram pages, at @made­with pas­sionsg.</p>
    <p>Ms Lynette Pang, ad­viser to the Sin­ga­pore Brand Of­fice, said: “By shar­ing the sto­ries be­hind both es­tab­lished and up-and-com­ing brands, we hope that more peo­ple will be able to re­dis­cover wellloved brands and be wowed by the myr­iad brands that speak of our pas­sion and cre­ativ­ity.”</p>
    <p>Ms Pang, who is also as­sis­tant chief ex­ec­u­tive of STB’s mar­ket­ing group, added that the starter slate of MWP brands show­cased re­source­ful­ness, am­bi­tion, de­ter­mi­na­tion, op­ti­mism and were down to earth, on top of be­ing of sound re­pute and hav­ing good cus­tomer fol­low­ing.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent list of brands is not ex­haus­tive, and the Gov­ern­ment plans to bring on board more brands shortly.</p>
    <p>Some MWP brands will also be car­ried on on­line mar­ket­places in­clud­ing Bou­tique Fairs’ on­line plat­form eBou­tiques, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines’ KrisShop and the Tex­tile and Fash­ion Fed­er­a­tion’s OneOr­chard.Store fash­ion and life­style e-store.</p>
    <p>A se­lec­tion of prod­ucts from MWP brands will also be avail­able from Jan­uary at a pop-up at re­tail space De­sign Or­chard, which was jointly de­vel­oped by En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, STB and JTC Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>There are also plans for more pop-ups over the next few months, in­clud­ing at the newly launched Re­tail Food Hall at Lau Pa Sat and se­lected FairPrice Finest stores.</p>
    <p>Be­sides pro­mot­ing the l ocal con­sumer goods in­dus­try, the MWP ini­tia­tive also aims to foster cross-brand part­ner­ships for a vi­brant and sup­port­ive busi­ness ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>Jumbo Group chief ex­ec­u­tive and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ang Kiam Meng, whose seafood restau­rant chain was awarded the MWP mark, said: “Sin­ga­pore brands should come to­gether to sup­port one an­other, build our na­tional brand eq­uity on the in­ter­na­tional stage and strengthen our lo­cal brand propo­si­tions of qual­ity, safety and in­no­va­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chris Hwang, co-founder of The Golden Duck, which sells gourmet snacks like salted egg yolk chips, added: “It is an op­por­tu­nity for us to show our cus­tomers how we can band to­gether as a na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Said En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s Ms Boey: “We hope that Made With Pas­sion will el­e­vate Sin­ga­pore brands col­lec­tively and help them achieve greater suc­cess.”</p>
    <p>WIN­DOW TO DIF­FER­ENT BRANDS By shar­ing the sto­ries be­hind both es­tab­lished and up-and-com­ing brands, we hope that more peo­ple will be able to re­dis­cover well-loved brands and be wowed by the myr­iad brands that speak of our pas­sion ’’ and cre­ativ­ity. MS LYNETTE PANG, ad­viser to the Sin­ga­pore Brand Of­fice.</p>
