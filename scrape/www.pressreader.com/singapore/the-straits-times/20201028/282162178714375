    <p>In the 2020 Mercer CFA In­sti­tute Global Pen­sion In­dex re­port, Sin­ga­pore’s pen­sion sys­tem ranked top in Asia and sev­enth out of 39 sys­tems as­sessed (Sin­ga­pore re­tains top spot in Asia on re­tire­ment in­come in­dex, Oct 20).</p>
    <p>This year, sys­tems were ac­cessed on whether or not they pro­vide ad­di­tional con­tri­bu­tions or ben­e­fits for par­ents car­ing for young chil­dren while the par­ent is not in the paid work­force.</p>
    <p>This recog­nises the gen­der gap in many sys­tems, re­sult­ing from un­equal norms around care­giv­ing that make it dif­fi­cult for women to par­tic­i­pate in the labour force, and thus make it dif­fi­cult for them to ac­cu­mu­late pen­sion funds.</p>
    <p>The re­port stated that 17 sys­tems pro­vide some form of pen­sion ben­e­fit for those tak­ing time out of the work­force for care­giv­ing. Sin­ga­pore was not among them.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, a sig­nif­i­cant gen­der gap in Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) sav­ings per­sists, though it was nar­rowed from 16 per cent in 2006 to 11 per cent in 2016.</p>
    <p>The re­tire­ment ad­e­quacy of women, as a whole, is a cause for con­cern. This is es­pe­cially true of in­ac­tive CPF mem­bers, that is, those who do not have any CPF em­ploy­ment con­tri­bu­tion paid for them for the cur­rent month, or any of the pre­ced­ing three months.</p>
    <p>Last year, women formed 62.6 per cent of per­sons who were not em­ployed.</p>
    <p>The CPF Matched Re­tire­ment Sav­ings Scheme, which takes ef­fect next year, is de­signed to help, among other peo­ple, care­givers (and there­fore women).</p>
    <p>Un­der the match­ing scheme, a con­tri­bu­tion must first be made (by any­one – CPF mem­bers or their fam­ily mem­bers) be­fore the Gov­ern­ment matches it. Fam­ily mem­bers who are poor may not be able to con­trib­ute to one another’s ac­counts to ben­e­fit from the scheme.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment should look into more forms of, or im­prove on ex­ist­ing, non-con­trib­u­tory schemes to en­sure that ev­ery­one at­tains a Ba­sic Re­tire­ment Sum.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment should con­sider es­tab­lish­ing an­nual au­to­matic ba­sic con­tri­bu­tions by the state to low-bal­ance in­di­vid­ual CPF ac­counts.</p>
