    <p>WASH­ING­TON • With hair dye stream­ing down his cheeks and Mr Don­ald Trump watch­ing on tele­vi­sion, the Pres­i­dent’s lawyer Rudy Gi­u­liani un­leashed eye­browrais­ing claims on Thurs­day that in­vestor Ge­orge Soros, China and a dead Venezue­lan dic­ta­tor con­spired with Demo­cratic “crooks” to hand Amer­ica’s elec­tion to Mr Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>In an ex­tra­or­di­nary 90-minute press con­fer­ence at the Repub­li­can Na­tional Com­mit­tee in Wash­ing­ton, Mr Gi­u­liani and other mem­bers of Mr Trump’s le­gal team left no doubt they were re­fus­ing to ac­knowl­edge Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den’s win, ar­gu­ing in­stead that a broad “na­tional con­spir­acy” to deny a Trump re-elec­tion was un­der way.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­u­liani opened with a frontal at­tack on “cor­rupt” Demo­crat­i­cled cities, like Detroit, which he ac­cused of pur­posely flip­ping thou­sands of votes to Mr Bi­den. He also spoke of “a plan from a cen­tralised place to ex­e­cute” voter fraud, and warned of an “iron cur­tain of cen­sor­ship” deny­ing the Amer­i­can peo­ple facts about the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Then it turned bizarre. “Did you all watch My Cousin Vinny?” asked Mr Gi­u­liani, who pro­ceeded to de­liver his best Joe Pesci im­per­son­ation, copy­ing the ac­tor’s mafioso per­sona from the hit 1992 movie.</p>
    <p>Pat­ting his bead­ing brow with a hand­ker­chief, and with sweat mixed with hair dye drip­ping down from his tem­ples, Mr Gi­u­liani launched at­tacks that veered to­wards the out­landish.</p>
    <p>“You should be more as­tounded by the fact that our votes are counted in Ger­many, and in Spain by a com­pany owned by af­fil­i­ates of Chavez and Maduro,” Mr Gi­u­liani said, re­fer­ring to Venezuela’s notorious strong­man Hugo Chavez, who has been dead for seven years, and the coun­try’s cur­rent left­ist Pres­i­dent Ni­co­las Maduro.</p>
    <p>The com­pany in ques­tion is elec­tions soft­ware firm Smart­matic, founded in 2000 in Florida by two men born in Venezuela.</p>
    <p>Smart­matic’s chair­man Mark Mal­loch-Brown is on the board of the Open So­ci­ety Foun­da­tion be­gun by Mr Soros, a bil­lion­aire phi­lan­thropist and re­cur­ring bo­gey­man of Repub­li­can politi­cians.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s chair­man “is a close as­so­ciate and busi­ness part­ner of Mr Ge­orge Soros, the big­gest donor to the Demo­cratic Party, the big­gest donor to An­tifa – and the big­gest donor of Black Lives Mat­ter”, Mr Gi­u­liani said.</p>
