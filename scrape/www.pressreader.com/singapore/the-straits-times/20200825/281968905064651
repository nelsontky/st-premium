    <p>Eight months into the worst pan­demic in re­cent mem­ory, it is clear that the ini­tial re­sponse of shut­ting down travel, bans on din­ing out and var­i­ous other mea­sures, while ap­pro­pri­ate and nec­es­sary at the time, has dam­aged the eco­nomic health of na­tions and dev­as­tated liveli­hoods. Many of the jobs lost will prob­a­bly never re­turn. Stu­dents are in dan­ger of los­ing en­tire school years and many who were poised to en­ter the job mar­ket now face a longer wait. Even deep-pock­eted na­tions are aware that their re­serves are not in­ter­minable even as some di­vert funds marked for other sec­tors to the cri­sis ef­fort. Also to be con­sid­ered are the long-term per­ils of peo­ple and busi­nesses get­ting too de­pen­dent on govern­ment sup­port.</p>
    <p>Against this back­drop of con­test be­tween life and liveli­hood, na­tions, es­pe­cially those that have gained con­fi­dence in con­trol­ling and treat­ing the dis­ease, are edg­ing to­wards eas­ing some re­stric­tions to help hard-hit sec­tors like avi­a­tion and tourism. Sin­ga­pore has moved in this di­rec­tion with “travel bub­bles” with coun­tries like China and Ja­pan, more lee­way for Changi Air­port tran­sit pas­sen­gers from des­ig­nated na­tions us­ing Sin­ga­pore Air­lines flights, and the de­ci­sion on gen­eral travel for Brunei and New Zealand from next month. The stay-home no­tice pe­riod for vis­i­tors from Aus­tralia (ex­clud­ing Vic­to­ria state), Ma­cau, main­land China, Tai­wan, Viet­nam and Malaysia will also be short­ened, from 14 days to seven.</p>
    <p>The most sig­nif­i­cant of the mea­sures, of course, is the par­tial eas­ing of move­ment from and to Malaysia. This will take place un­der two schemes: the re­cip­ro­cal green lane for trav­ellers on shorter vis­its, and the longer-term pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment that al­lows Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia res­i­dents who hold long-term im­mi­gra­tion passes for busi­ness and work pur­poses in the other coun­try to en­ter that coun­try for work. Safe­guards such as the seven days stay-home no­tice for pe­ri­odic com­muters and pre-de­par­ture health checks for the green lane users will no doubt act as some­what of a brake. Still, it is dif­fi­cult to see the daily num­bers of Cause­way users re­turn­ing too quickly to the pre-Covid num­ber of 300,000.</p>
    <p>Other na­tions are try­ing sim­i­lar steps. South Korea, for in­stance, has a fast lane for busi­ness and es­sen­tial travel. The key to all this is cal­i­bra­tion. Be­ing too hasty with re­open­ing can have costly con­se­quences. The United King­dom, for in­stance, has had to re­in­state quar­an­tine mea­sures on trav­ellers from Spain, France, Malta and the Nether­lands. Fin­land has re­moved most Euro­pean Union coun­tries from its “green lane” travel list. Closer to home, Aus­tralia to­day has one of the world’s tough­est Covid-19 travel rules be­cause of a fresh out­break in Vic­to­ria caused by re­turnees who breached the ho­tel quar­an­tine sys­tem. The les­son here is ob­vi­ous: If travel is to be eased, the trav­eller must play his part as well.</p>
