    <p>•</p>
    <p>BUENOS AIRES Lionel Messi will take a break from his Barcelona soap opera as he bids to fire Ar­gentina to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and what will prob­a­bly be his last chance to try to win the cov­eted tro­phy.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old, a record six­time win­ner of the Bal­lon d’Or, has won ev­ery­thing in the club game with Barcelona sev­eral times over but his in­ter­na­tional tro­phy cabi­net looks bare in com­par­i­son.</p>
    <p>“The only goal I have now is to win the World Cup with the na­tional team,” he has said.</p>
    <p>The clos­est he has come was as los­ing fi­nal­ist against Ger­many in 2014.</p>
    <p>The South Amer­i­can World Cup qualifiers start to­day and the clash with Ecuador gives him the chance to start build­ing to­wards one last tilt at that goal.</p>
    <p>He will be 35 by the time the Qatar World Cup ends, and will turn 39 dur­ing the fol­low­ing global show­piece in North Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, he has a pair of qualifiers – Ar­gentina also travel to Bo­livia next Tues­day – to dis­tract him from his club tra­vails.</p>
    <p>Messi tried to force his exit from the Cata­lan gi­ants in the close sea­son but Barca held firm and a €700 mil­lion (S$1.1 bil­lion) re­lease clause en­sured he re­mained, al­beit grudg­ingly.</p>
    <p>Play­ing Ecuador in his home­land may pro­vide a wel­come respite but it is also fraught with po­ten­tial pit­falls. Five years ago at the start of qual­i­fy­ing for the 2018 World Cup, Ecuador stunned Ar­gentina 2-0 at River Plate’s iconic Monumental sta­dium in Buenos Aires.</p>
    <p>It took a hat-trick by an in­spired</p>
    <p>Messi in Ar­gentina’s fi­nal qual­i­fier two years later – away to Ecuador – to send the two-time world cham­pi­ons to Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>To­day’s match will be in an­other iconic sta­dium: Boca Ju­niors’ Bom­bon­era. But it will be a sur­real ex­pe­ri­ence in an empty ground that would nor­mally be bounc­ing with some of the most pas­sion­ate fans in</p>
    <p>the world. Covid-19 has put paid to any hopes of a pay­ing pub­lic.</p>
    <p>This is a much-changed Ar­gentina from that which dis­ap­pointed at the last World Cup.</p>
    <p>Young coach Lionel Scaloni em­barked on an am­bi­tious re­gen­er­a­tion of the squad fol­low­ing the ab­ject last-16 exit from Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>How­ever, along­side his “new guard” re­main sev­eral old hats, like Messi.</p>
    <p>“We can say that there are seven or eight ‘mem­ory’ play­ers that are the foun­da­tion,” said Scaloni, 42, point­ing out that with “only one day of prepa­ra­tion”, they would need the ex­pe­ri­enced heads to help the team.</p>
    <p>He will be with­out in­jured Manch­ester City for­ward Ser­gio Aguero while Paris Saint-Ger­main winger An­gel di Maria has been left out.</p>
    <p>One player com­pet­ing to lead the line is Sevilla’s Lu­cas Ocam­pos.</p>
    <p>“He’s strong, tech­ni­cal and scores goals, and also helps in the de­fen­sive phase,” said Scaloni, who will have to also choose be­tween Paulo Dy­bala of Ju­ven­tus and In­ter Mi­lan’s Lautaro Martinez.</p>
    <p>It has been a tur­bu­lent pe­riod for Ecuador, who will be led by Ar­gen­tinian Gus­tavo Al­faro in his first job as a na­tional team coach af­ter Jordi Cruyff quit with­out ever lead­ing the team.</p>
    <p>Cruyff, the son of late Dutch legend Jo­han, was hired in Jan­uary but foot­ball was sus­pended due to Covid-19 be­fore he could take charge of his first match and he sub­se­quently re­signed in July.</p>
