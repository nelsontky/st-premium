    <p>These heart­land play ar­eas man­aged by town coun­cils are worth a visit too.</p>
    <p>Oa­sis Water­park @ Nee Soon East at Block 307,</p>
    <p>Yishun Cen­tral</p>
    <p>Launched in June last year, this free com­mu­nity wa­ter park has three play zones, rest ar­eas, show­ers and nurs­ing rooms.</p>
    <p>It is about 10 min­utes’ walk from Yishun MRT sta­tion and there are plenty of neigh­bour­hood park­ing spa­ces around.</p>
    <p>The wa­ter park closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, but re­opened in Septem­ber with new safety re­stric­tions, which al­low only 15 vis­i­tors dur­ing each two-hour slot.</p>
    <p>Bring your own wa­ter or buy a drink from the vend­ing ma­chines here as the wa­ter cool­ers are off lim­its.</p>
    <p>The venue is opened from</p>
    <p>2 to 9pm on week­days, and from noon to 9pm on week­ends, pub­lic hol­i­days and school hol­i­days. Walk-ins are not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Call the Nee Soon Town Coun­cil on 6758-0129 (week­days, 8am to 5pm) to book a slot up to seven days in ad­vance. Week­end slots are so pop­u­lar that you have to try your luck at 8am ev­ery Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Fu Shan Gar­den at 81 Wood­lands Street 81</p>
    <p>If your kids loved the di­nosaurs at Changi Air­port’s Juras­sic Mile dis­play, they will have a roar­ing good time at this park, about 10 min­utes’ walk from Wood­lands MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Un­der the shade of ma­ture trees, you will find a pair of poker-faced Dimetrodon, one rest­ing on a “log” that the lit­tle ones can climb in and out of, and an­other on a “rock” that serves as a slide.</p>
    <p>Wan­der around and you will spy a lan­guorous sauro­pod whose elon­gated body hides a slide, a Pter­a­n­odon poised for flight on top of a small hill, as well as a diminu­tive T-Rex that you can pet.</p>
    <p>There is an un­de­ni­able charm to these old-school struc­tures, which still at­tract young­sters, but the park has two rel­a­tively new dino ad­di­tions that will de­light fam­i­lies. A yel­low Tricer­atops and a green Stegosauru­s add pops of vivid colour that look great in pho­tos, as well as loads of climb­ing fun with their slat­ted wood de­signs.</p>
    <p>If your kids need a pee break, the Wood­lands Com­mu­nity Club is just across the road.</p>
