    <p>Sin­ga­pore house­holds used on av­er­age more elec­tric­ity and gas each month be­tween April and July, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Their elec­tric­ity con­sump­tion rose 16 per cent while that of gas went up 34 per cent, as peo­ple spent more time at home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and the early stages of Sin­ga­pore’s phased reopening amid the pan­demic, said Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Tan See Leng yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing in Par­lia­ment to Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang) who asked whether elec­tric­ity and gas con­sump­tion has risen as more peo­ple work from home.</p>
    <p>Mr Liang also asked for the ba­sis of the lat­est in­crease in elec­tric­ity and gas tar­iffs.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said both prices gen­er­ally move in tan­dem with global fuel prices and have av­er­aged around 24.58 cents/kWh for elec­tric­ity and 19.64 cents/kWh for gas since Jan­uary 2018.</p>
    <p>He added that fuel prices rose by 46.6 per cent in the third quar­ter of this year, since drop­ping to their low­est lev­els in the past 20 years in April, as global eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity grad­u­ally re­sumed.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, elec­tric­ity and gas tar­iffs rose to 22.93 cents/kWh and 18.39 cents/kWh re­spec­tively in the fourth quar­ter of this year.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, how­ever, em­pha­sised that elec­tric­ity and gas tar­iffs in the third and fourth quar­ters re­main lower than in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>They are also among the low­est since Jan­uary 2018.</p>
    <p>“For elec­tric­ity tar­iffs in par­tic­u­lar, it is worth point­ing out that the Q4 2020 tar­iffs still re­main at 11.6 per cent lower than Q1 2020 and 6.7 per cent lower than the av­er­age elec­tric­ity tar­iff be­tween Jan­uary 2018 and Septem­ber 2020,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that around 47 per cent of all house­holds will not be af­fected by the new prices, as they have switched to the Open Elec­tric­ity Mar­ket, where it is in the in­ter­est of con­sumers to switch to fixed­price pack­age plans.</p>
    <p>“If it is pos­si­ble, most house­holds should look at these plans that are avail­able... be­cause I think in the en­su­ing quar­ters ahead, there should con­tinue to be all this volatil­ity and fluc­tu­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect more of it to hap­pen,” Dr Tan said.</p>
    <p>Mr Liang also asked if in­creased devel­op­ment in al­ter­na­tive en­ergy sources has helped re­duce the over­all cost of elec­tric­ity.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said Sin­ga­pore’s ge­o­graph­i­cal lim­i­ta­tions mean al­ter­na­tive en­ergy sources make up a small pro­por­tion of its power gen­er­a­tion to­day.</p>
    <p>He added that the coun­try is aim­ing for a five­fold in­crease in its so­lar power ca­pac­ity from around 0.4 gi­gawatt-peak (GWp) to­day to at least 2 GWp by 2030.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther said that Sin­ga­porean homes have been given more sup­port for their util­ity bills this year.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, ev­ery house­hold with at least one Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen has re­ceived a one-off $100 Sol­i­dar­ity Util­i­ties Credit in their July or Au­gust SP Group util­ity bill.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan added that el­i­gi­ble Hous­ing Board house­holds also re­ceived the GST Voucher – USave, which was dou­bled this year through a one-off GST Voucher – USave Spe­cial Pay­ment.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble HDB house­holds with five or more mem­bers also re­ceived a first por­tion of fur­ther GST Voucher – U-Save re­bates of be­tween $60 and $100 per house­hold this month, with a sec­ond por­tion to be dis­bursed in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan said that be­fore this year, the an­nual amount of GST Voucher – U-Save given to res­i­dents in one­and two-room HDB flats was equiv­a­lent to about three to four months of their util­i­ties bill.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, he said, with the ad­di­tional sup­port this year, these same house­holds will get sup­port equiv­a­lent to at least six to eight months of their util­i­ties bills on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies in three- and four-room HDB flats will re­ceive sup­port equiv­a­lent to at least two to four months of their util­i­ties bills, up from one to two months of their pre­vi­ous bills.</p>
