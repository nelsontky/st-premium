    <p>Be­fore Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam spoke about the case of In­done­sian do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani in Par­lia­ment on Wed­nes­day, many Sin­ga­pore­ans won­dered if there was a mis­car­riage of jus­tice in the way she had been pre­vi­ously con­victed of steal­ing $34,000 of items from her former em­ployer Liew Mun Leong, who used to be chief ex­ec­u­tive of Cap­i­taLand.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, af­ter the par­lia­men­tary de­bate in which new in­for­ma­tion was dis­closed, many will con­tinue to ask if jus­tice was served – be­cause she was even­tu­ally ac­quit­ted.</p>
    <p>Wel­come to jus­tice in an im­per­fect world.</p>
    <p>NEW EV­I­DENCE</p>
    <p>High Court judge Chan Seng Onn was widely seen as hav­ing righted the scales of jus­tice by over­turn­ing Ms Parti’s con­vic­tion on ap­peal. In his judg­ment, he rapped the po­lice over a break in the chain of cus­tody of ev­i­dence, chided pros­e­cu­tors over the demon­stra­tion of a faulty DVD player at trial, and crit­i­cised the lower court judge for mis­ap­ply­ing the “le­gal and ev­i­den­tial bur­dens of proof”.</p>
    <p>Then, on Wed­nes­day, Mr Shan­mugam spoke in Par­lia­ment for over two hours on the case, pro­vid­ing new in­for­ma­tion that emerged from an in­ter­nal re­view of how the po­lice and the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) had han­dled the case, that had been sparked by the High Court judg­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti had ad­mit­ted to tak­ing 10 to 15 items of male cloth­ing. Also, it emerged that the Liews’ de­ci­sion to ter­mi­nate her em­ploy­ment was not abrupt, as the judge had as­sumed.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan had ac­quit­ted Ms Parti, as it was pos­si­ble the Liews might have an “im­proper mo­tive” to ac­cuse her of theft, and to ter­mi­nate her em­ploy­ment sud­denly, so that she could not com­plain to the Min­istry of Man­power about be­ing il­le­gally de­ployed to clean the house and of­fice of Mr Liew’s son Karl.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said that, in fact, the Liews had sus­pected their maid of steal­ing from 2015, and de­cided to ter­mi­nate her em­ploy­ment in Septem­ber 2016. Once a re­place­ment was found, they de­cided to let her go.</p>
    <p>As for the threat to com­plain, Mr Shan­mugam said this was a complaint about be­ing sent home on short no­tice, not of il­le­gal de­ploy­ment – a point backed by an em­ploy­ment agent present when Ms Parti made that threat.</p>
    <p>While untested in court, the new in­for­ma­tion now made pub­lic will lead many Sin­ga­pore­ans to ask, as Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) MP Xie Yao Quan did in Par­lia­ment: “Is Ms Liyani in fact guilty?”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam did not give Mr Xie a di­rect an­swer, say­ing only: “She has been ac­quit­ted by the High Court and I said that we must pro­ceed on that ba­sis, and not re­open that is­sue. I think we leave it at that. And I don’t want to com­ment on the de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>With the High Court de­ci­sion, the case is closed and its judg­ment fi­nal. But in the court of pub­lic opin­ion, the jury is still out.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, the nig­gling feel­ing over a pos­si­ble mis­car­riage of jus­tice may pre­vail, although di­rected to­wards a dif­fer­ent tar­get. Now, some will won­der if the High Court ac­quit­tal was just, and if Ms Parti did in fact steal some items, but has man­aged to get away scot-free, while the po­lice of­fi­cer in­ves­ti­gat­ing her faces dis­ci­plinary ac­tion for de­lay­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions by five weeks, and Karl Liew has been charged with giv­ing false ev­i­dence and in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>But as Mr Shan­mugam noted, this was just one of the 10 per cent of ap­peal cases which suc­ceeded. This sim­ply meant that the higher court dis­agreed with the lower court, he said. As he ex­plained, the ques­tion “is not which court was right or wrong. The key ques­tion is: Was the case con­ducted fairly in both courts?”</p>
    <p>“OWNSELF CHECK OWNSELF”?</p>
    <p>As far as this par­tic­u­lar episode goes, some clar­ity has been achieved.</p>
    <p>This wasn’t a straight­for­ward case. One pic­ture emerged from the State Courts. An­other sce­nario was laid out at the High Court. A third vari­a­tion was pre­sented at the par­lia­men­tary de­bate. Sin­ga­pore­ans will have dif­fer­ent the­o­ries on what re­ally hap­pened, and whether and how jus­tice was served.</p>
    <p>But on the core is­sue of whether a rich, pow­er­ful fam­ily pulled the strings of the jus­tice sys­tem for its own ben­e­fit, the an­swer from Mr Shan­mugam was clear: No.</p>
    <p>There was no at­tempt by any­one to in­flu­ence the po­lice or AGC, which han­dled it as a “rou­tine theft case”.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the over­loaded po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer took five weeks be­fore vis­it­ing the Liews’ home, the scene of the of­fence – which is the op­po­site of what one ex­pects if the case were flagged for spe­cial at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>As Mr Shan­mugam stressed, and as MPs from both sides af­firmed, equal­ity be­fore the law re­mains a core tenet of the jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Scep­ti­cal Sin­ga­pore­ans out there, how­ever, may say this was yet an­other case of “ownself check ownself”. The in­ter­nal re­view of po­lice process was done by the Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment. The pros­e­cu­tion’s con­duct is now the sub­ject of a dis­ci­plinary process.</p>
    <p>Why not have an in­de­pen­dent com­mis­sion of in­quiry (COI), some will no doubt ask. This was in­deed Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai’s call in Par­lia­ment. In re­sponse, Mr Shan­mugam noted that such a com­mis­sion re­quired hav­ing a se­nior judge pre­side and in­volved con­sid­er­able re­sources, but he was pre­pared to rec­om­mend to Cab­i­net to have one if needed.</p>
    <p>He asked Mr Leong, who is from the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party, to pin­point spe­cific is­sues not dealt with, that mer­ited such an in­quiry. When Mr Leong replied, he re­sponded to each point. Then he asked if Mr Leong was sug­gest­ing there was im­proper in­flu­ence on the case, to which the lat­ter said no. Af­ter a se­ries of heated but po­lite ex­changes, Mr Leong with­drew his call for an in­de­pen­dent com­mis­sion and Mr Shan­mugam thanked him.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong did not come across as in­tim­i­dated, so I pre­sume he with­drew his call for a COI on prin­ci­ple – with con­fi­dence that there was no need for one, af­ter the in­ter­nal re­views, par­lia­men­tary de­bate and forth­com­ing dis­ci­plinary pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>THE QUES­TION OF BIAS</p>
    <p>So the rich folk in this case didn’t en­gage in “in­flu­ence ped­dling”, to use Mr Shan­mugam’s term.</p>
    <p>But was there bias? Were the po­lice and pros­e­cu­tion of­fi­cers more in­clined to be­lieve the Liews than the maid?</p>
    <p>When Sin­ga­pore­ans ask if the jus­tice sys­tem is bi­ased, they are ask­ing not just whether the priv­i­leged get favourable treat­ment or pull strings for them­selves, but also whether po­lice of­fi­cers, pros­e­cu­tors, even judges, in­ter­nalise so­cial hi­er­ar­chies and make de­ci­sions that favour the rich and pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>Are they more in­clined to be­lieve the tes­ti­mony of some­one from a sim­i­lar so­cio-eco­nomic class as them­selves? Who went to the same school as them?</p>
    <p>This is at the root of dis­com­fort over in­equal­ity in Sin­ga­pore, the sense that re­wards and bet­ter treat­ment, in­clud­ing a bet­ter chance of a favourable out­come in court, might go to those in the “in­sider” group.</p>
    <p>This kind of bias is harder to de­tect and deal with. I know bias is a hu­man trait, and such is­sues are hard to un­pack. In my Septem­ber com­men­tary on the Parti Liyani case which Mr Shan­mugam shared on his Face­book page and promised an­swers to, I had asked if ex­plicit or im­plicit bias played a role in this case.</p>
    <p>Bias can be sussed out by one’s ac­tions and de­ci­sions. It can be in­ferred from one’s state­ments. But it is also a state of mind, a meta-at­ti­tude that is hard to tease out. It can be seen in, for ex­am­ple, a po­lice of­fi­cer or judge who takes the word of Karl Liew that an item be­longed to him, more eas­ily than he would be­lieve the maid who said it was hers and she bought it. Weigh­ing who and what to be­lieve, when, and by how much, is sub­jec­tive, and yet so much of the jus­tice process in­volves such sub­jec­tive as­sess­ment, al­beit backed by what­ever ev­i­dence is avail­able. Such assess­ments are eas­ily in­flu­enced by bias.</p>
    <p>While Mr Shan­mugam did not ad­dress such im­plicit bias ex­plic­itly in his min­is­te­rial state­ment, he did deal with it when re­spond­ing to PAP MP Christophe­r de Souza on how to “en­trench im­par­tial­ity”.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said that while ex­plicit bias can be de­tected, “we got to be al­ways on guard” to see if some im­plicit bias is at work and “we got to guard against it”.</p>
    <p>The best pro­tec­tion against bias is a sys­tem where the po­lice, AGC as well as the State Courts and the High Court all work in­de­pen­dently, have a clear role, and ar­rive at the right re­sult.</p>
    <p>“I think that’s the safe­guard. Good peo­ple across all the dif­fer­ent parts, clear rules, trans­parency and ac­count­abil­ity. When peo­ple ask ques­tions, we have to be ac­count­able here. And if some­thing goes wrong, the will to put it right as well... And to be very alert about any kind of in­flu­ence ped­dling,” he added.</p>
    <p>The High Court judge did his part in cor­rect­ing what he saw was a wrong judg­ment, and took pains to point out weak­nesses in the po­lice and pros­e­cu­tion process.</p>
    <p>The rel­e­vant min­istries took up the crit­i­cisms and did an in­ter­nal re­view.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment per­formed its duty as a fo­rum which the Gov­ern­ment ac­counts to. The op­po­si­tion stepped up – the Work­ers’ Party’s mo­tion raised the qual­ity of de­bate to look be­yond this one episode to con­sider broader sys­temic is­sues, with their MPs ar­gu­ing pas­sion­ately for mea­sures to im­prove ac­cess and fair­ness in the jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>JUS­TICE IN SO­CI­ETY</p>
    <p>In over 30 years of cov­er­ing par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings as a jour­nal­ist, I would rank Wed­nes­day’s de­bate among the top five in watch­a­bil­ity and im­por­tance.</p>
    <p>It was as grip­ping as a le­gal thriller and as dra­matic as a po­lit­i­cal se­ries on Net­flix. The nine-hour de­bate should be edited into a two-hour docu-drama. Like the other iconic par­lia­men­tary de­bates (over min­is­te­rial salaries in 1994 and dis­counted prop­erty pur­chases in 1996), this de­bate is about pol­i­tics and jus­tice in the real world. It is can­did about how jus­tice works in the real world, and about the risks of “in­flu­ence ped­dling”, es­pe­cially in close-knit Sin­ga­pore where many peo­ple know one an­other, and how to pre­vent it.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam, who said he had spent 22 years in pri­vate prac­tice, added: “I have worked with many se­nior coun­sels, se­nior lawyers, ap­peared be­fore many judges. Our small size means these con­nec­tions, in­ter­ac­tions are in­evitable.”</p>
    <p>Where there is a con­flict, the per­son in­volved can re­cuse him­self. Oth­er­wise, there is no neat so­lu­tion ex­cept to ap­point peo­ple of moral fi­bre to do the right thing. “Al­ways re­mem­ber, we are fidu­cia­ries... Do not al­low any cor­ro­sion of pub­lic in­ter­est. Act with hon­our. Be wor­thy of the trust peo­ple have re­posed in us.”</p>
    <p>As the de­bate con­tin­ued, I felt some pride in how Sin­ga­pore’s democ­racy is ma­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>With a few pro­ce­dural lapses, the jus­tice sys­tem worked as it should – from in­ves­ti­ga­tion to pros­e­cu­tion, con­vic­tion, ap­peal and ac­quit­tal. The High Court judge did his part in cor­rect­ing what he saw was a wrong judg­ment, and took pains to point out weak­nesses in the po­lice and pros­e­cu­tion process. The rel­e­vant min­istries took up the crit­i­cisms and did an in­ter­nal re­view.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment per­formed its duty as a fo­rum which the Gov­ern­ment ac­counts to. The op­po­si­tion stepped up – the Work­ers’ Party’s mo­tion raised the qual­ity of de­bate to look be­yond this one episode to con­sider broader sys­temic is­sues, with their MPs ar­gu­ing pas­sion­ately for mea­sures to im­prove ac­cess and fair­ness in the jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>In­deed, Mr Shan­mugam said the Gov­ern­ment was on the same page as the WP and they were “push­ing on an open door” as far as their calls to ex­pand le­gal aid and cod­ify pros­e­cu­tion dis­clo­sure of in­for­ma­tion to the de­fence are con­cerned.</p>
    <p>Out­side Par­lia­ment, Ms Parti is be­ing sup­ported by var­i­ous mi­grant worker rights groups and de­fended by ded­i­cated pro bono lawyers like Anil Balchan­dani. They are not let­ting up in press­ing for jus­tice as they see it.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, other rights groups want im­prove­ments in how vul­ner­a­ble for­eign­ers are dealt with in the jus­tice sys­tem here.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam also men­tioned the role of the me­dia and a well-in­formed pub­lic in scru­ti­n­is­ing court de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­ture, the ex­ec­u­tive, the ju­di­ciary, the me­dia, the pub­lic, and an ac­tive civil so­ci­ety sec­tor – these are all com­po­nents of a mod­ern democ­racy that to­gether help en­sure jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice is not just about what hap­pens in a case in court. We live in an im­per­fect world and jus­tice is never straight­for­ward or ab­so­lute.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice is also about how we all re­late to one an­other in life and how the com­po­nent parts of dif­fer­ent in­sti­tu­tions ad­here to ad­vance fair­ness and equal­ity. By that mea­sure, I think the Parti Liyani case shows we are do­ing quite well.</p>
