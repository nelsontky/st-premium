    <p>Home-grown so­lar power com­pany Sun­seap Group has set up an elec­tric mobility unit called Charge+, with an aim to in­stall 10,000 elec­tric ve­hi­cle (EV) charg­ing points here by 2030.</p>
    <p>The num­ber is more than onethird of the 28,000 which the Gov­ern­ment said Sin­ga­pore would have by the end of the decade, and could make the com­pany the largest EV charg­ing provider here.</p>
    <p>Charge+ chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Chee Kiong told The Straits Times that in­stal­la­tion will be­gin in the first quar­ter of next year at com­mer­cial, in­dus­trial and res­i­den­tial premises.</p>
    <p>Most will be 7.4 kilo­watt (kW) al­ter­nat­ing cur­rent charg­ers, but there will be some 60kW di­rect cur­rent fast charg­ers.</p>
    <p>“We hope the en­tire project can be com­pleted by as early as 2025,” said Mr Goh, who was pre­vi­ously in charge of SP Group’s EV charg­ing busi­ness.</p>
    <p>He said Charge+ ad­dresses “pain points” in dense cities with space and power sup­ply con­straints. Many build­ings in Sin­ga­pore have lim­ited power sup­ply, he noted, but most of these would be able to ac­com­mo­date 7.4kW charg­ers with­out ma­jor in­fras­truc­tural al­ter­ations.</p>
    <p>De­signed in-house, the 7.4kW charg­ers are “ul­tra-slim” to fit the small­est carpark spa­ces in Sin­ga­pore. At around 150mm, they are less than half the thick­ness of other charg­ers used here.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh also claimed they are the world’s slimmest dual-gun charg­ers.</p>
    <p>The 7.4kW charg­ers can charge two ve­hi­cles at the same time, and can also ad­just the avail­able power sup­ply ac­cord­ing to the num­ber of ve­hi­cles be­ing charged.</p>
    <p>Charge+ chair­man Ong Tze Boon, an ar­chi­tect who de­signed the charg­ers, said they are also durable, weath­er­proof and con­nected to the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>Un­like other charg­ers here which are made of plas­tic, these are made of pressed steel, Mr Ong said. “It is a plug-and-play unit which does not need a special shel­ter or a hous­ing.”</p>
    <p>He added: “It is de­signed by Sin­ga­pore for the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>The charg­ers will be man­u­fac­tured in China, and are ex­pected to cost be­low $2,000 each, mak­ing them more com­pet­i­tively priced than most other charg­ers here.</p>
    <p>Sun­seap chief ex­ec­u­tive Frank Phuan said Charge+ gels with the group’s fo­cus on re­new­able en­ergy.</p>
    <p>He said Sun­seap has in­stalled so</p>
    <p>It is a plug-and-play unit which does not need a special shel­ter or a hous­ing... It is de­signed by Sin­ga­pore for the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket.</p>
    <p>lar pan­els at close to 4,000 lo­ca­tions here, and it would be fea­si­ble for EV charg­ers at these sites to be partly or fully pow­ered by the sun.</p>
    <p>This would help ad­dress a fre­quent con­cern that EVs are not ac­tu­ally car­bon-free, Mr Phuan added.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh said Charge+ will mar­ket its prod­uct in the re­gion, where many dense cities face sim­i­lar con­straints as Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“We have pan-Asian am­bi­tions.”</p>
