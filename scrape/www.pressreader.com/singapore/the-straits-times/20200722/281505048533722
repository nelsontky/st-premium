    <p>More than 80 ho­tels have been ap­proved for stay­ca­tions, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ho­tels con­tacted by The Straits Times said the ap­provals came in time for the on­go­ing week-long school hol­i­days and the two up­com­ing long week­ends – July 31 for Hari Raya Haji and Aug 9 for Na­tional Day – when de­mand is ex­pected to be strong.</p>
    <p>As for­eign vis­i­tor ar­rivals in Singapore have all but dried up due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, ho­tels, which are fac­ing the worst oc­cu­pancy rates in his­tory, are turn­ing to travel-starved lo­cals to fill rooms.</p>
    <p>Since July 3, ho­tels that wish to pro­vide ac­com­mo­da­tion to guests for leisure pur­poses could ap­ply for ap­proval.</p>
    <p>More than 100 ho­tels have done so, said STB.</p>
    <p>To be ap­proved, ho­tels must ad­here to strin­gent safe man­age­ment prac­tices to pre­vent the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>These in­clude re­duc­ing ca­pac­ity and in­ter­min­gling, rig­or­ous clean­ing and dis­in­fect­ing reg­i­mens, and screen­ing guests be­fore en­try.</p>
    <p>Guests are re­quired to wear a mask within the premises, with some ex­cep­tions, such as in their own room or while eat­ing.</p>
    <p>STB chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan said he be­lieved lo­cals will “want to ven­ture out and ex­plore Singapore”, and sup­port local busi­nesses while do­ing so.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Sin­ga­pore­ans spent $34.2 bil­lion on over­seas travel.</p>
    <p>“While the local spend­ing may not be enough to make up for the loss of tourism re­ceipts, this will con­trib­ute to­wards busi­ness rev­enue and help busi­nesses tide over this chal­leng­ing pe­riod,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Singapore may be a small country com­pared with our re­gional neigh­bours, but our city is filled with hid­den gems and great ex­pe­ri­ences in ev­ery precinct wait­ing to be dis­cov­ered.”</p>
    <p>All the four ho­tels con­tacted de­scribed the re­open­ing for stay­ca­tions as much-needed re­lief, al­though cur­rent oc­cu­pancy rates re­main far be­low pre-Covid-19 lev­els.</p>
    <p>Ho­tel Soloha’s founder Josh Hu said its cur­rent oc­cu­pancy rate was hov­er­ing around 50 per cent, be­low the typ­i­cal 70 per cent to 80 per cent in pre-Covid-19 days.</p>
    <p>The bou­tique ho­tel, which opened last Au­gust in the Keong Saik area, was closed for more than three months dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and phase one of Singapore’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>When the ho­tel launched its stay­ca­tion pro­mo­tions af­ter get­ting ap­proval from STB, Mr Hu said it re­ceived calls and e-mail in­quiries “in ex­cess of 20 for the first few days”.</p>
    <p>Some ho­tels are hope­ful stay­ca­tions will gain trac­tion in the light of the global travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The Fuller­ton Ho­tel and The Fuller­ton Bay Ho­tel Singapore have re­ceived more than 200 book­ings for this week­end, and fore­see a strong de­mand for rooms in com­ing weeks.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter months of iso­la­tion and with out­bound travel bans still in place, local residents seek a safe en­vi­ron­ment to un­wind and re­con­nect with their loved ones,” said Mr Cava­liere Gio­vanni Vit­erale, gen­eral man­ager of The Fuller­ton Ho­tels and Re­sorts.</p>
    <p>At Yo­tel Singapore Or­chard Road, next-day book­ings came in on the day it ob­tained STB’s ap­proval.</p>
    <p>Its gen­eral man­ager Bren­dan Daly said that while stay­ca­tions are an im­por­tant seg­ment, they can­not re­place pre-Covid-19 busi­ness lev­els be­cause of the size of Singapore’s do­mes­tic mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Jean-Philippe Ja­copin, gen­eral man­ager of Or­chard Ho­tel Singapore, said it has re­ceived more than 20 book­ings for the up­com­ing two long week­ends, with more ex­pected nearer to the week­end.</p>
    <p>Ms Kwee Wei-Lin, pres­i­dent of the Singapore Ho­tel As­so­ci­a­tion, said ho­tels of­fer­ing stay­ca­tions had re­ported “sig­nif­i­cant de­mand”, and do­mes­tic tourism would pro­vide “short-term fi­nan­cial re­lief” and “mean­ing­ful guest en­gage­ments” as Singapore grad­u­ally re­opens.</p>
    <p>“Nat­u­rally, the rev­enue will not be com­pa­ra­ble to the buoy­ant re­sults be­fore Covid-19,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We hope that more Sin­ga­pore­ans will start to sup­port stay­ca­tions not just as an escape from home, but also as an en­rich­ing way to learn about Singapore’s cul­tural precincts, ex­plore new neigh­bour­hoods and local her­itage.”</p>
