    <p>Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin will of­fi­cially launch his Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion in Sabah on Saturday ahead of the Sept 26 elec­tions in the coun­try’s east­ern­most state.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter Tan Sri Muhyid­din in re­cent weeks pieced to­gether the ba­sic build­ing blocks to­wards na­tional polls that he plans to call within the next six months.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial sources told The Straits Times that last week­end’s for­mal sign­ing up of Se­nior Min­is­ter for Econ­omy Azmin Ali into the premier’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu) was the last ma­jor step be­fore un­veil­ing the PN pact that has faced re­sis­tance from Umno, the gov­ern­ment’s largest com­po­nent.</p>
    <p>The move comes in con­cert with open­ing up the party to non-bu­mi­put­eras. Bu­mi­put­eras is a term used to col­lec­tively re­fer to the Malay ma­jor­ity and Malaysia’s indige­nous tribes.</p>
    <p>A Ber­satu leader with knowl­edge of the mat­ter said: “We will go ahead with five or six com­po­nents as this makes it the largest coali­tion of rul­ing par­ties, and we will use the PN logo for the Sabah polls. It is up to Umno whether it wants to fol­low suit.”</p>
    <p>Par­ties that have of­fi­cially signed up to PN in­clude Sabah’s Home­land Sol­i­dar­ity Party, as well as Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) and Malaysian In­dian Congress, even though the lat­ter two are al­ready part of other al­liances with Umno.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that Parti Ber­satu Sabah and Parti Ber­satu Rakyat Sabah are likely to join be­fore Saturday’s launch in Kota Kinabalu that un­of­fi­cially kicks off</p>
    <p>PN’s cam­paign for polls to elect a new state gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Muhyid­din ad­min­is­tra­tion is called PN, it is a grand coali­tion made up of the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional (BN), which was de­feated at the 2018 gen­eral elec­tion; the Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak (GPS) pact, which con­trols Malaysia’s largest state; PAS; and sev­eral in­de­pen­dent par­ties in Sabah.</p>
    <p>The once dom­i­nant Umno prefers to con­test un­der its decades-old BN flag in a tus­sle for lever­age ever since Mr Muhyid­din was sworn in on March 1 af­ter most of his Ber­satu, as well as Datuk Seri Azmin’s fac­tion from the mul­ti­eth­nic Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR), de­fected from the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>GPS, made up of par­ties that broke away from BN af­ter the 2018 de­feat, has main­tained it will use its own logo.</p>
    <p>But the en­try of the Azmin camp, which in­cludes 10 MPs, has paved the way for Ber­satu to re­form into a mul­tira­cial – al­beit Malay-led – party and re­duce the over­lap with</p>
    <p>Umno and PAS.</p>
    <p>“Open­ing Ber­satu to all races en­larges our po­lit­i­cal base. With­out ced­ing our com­mit­ment to the wel­fare of bu­mi­put­eras, we are invit­ing all Malaysians to join us and we want to cham­pion their in­ter­ests too,” Gom­bak Se­tia assem­bly­man Hil­man Id­ham, who is Mr Azmin’s po­lit­i­cal sec­re­tary, told ST.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din has told the Ber­satu grass­roots he wants to gain a per­sonal and stronger man­date de­spite the cur­rent par­lia­men­tary term end­ing only in l ate 2023, hav­ing fought to keep hold of his r a z o r - t h i n ma j o r i t y of the 222-strong leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, he has man­aged to win all votes in Par­lia­ment and is now mulling over whether to launch an “elec­tion bud­get” be­fore head­ing to the bal­lot.</p>
    <p>PN sources told ST that on­go­ing seat ne­go­ti­a­tions have achieved a con­sen­sus that the 113 largely Malay-ma­jor­ity par­lia­men­tary wards con­trolled by the coali­tion be­long to the MPs’ re­spec­tive par­ties al­though swops can be dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers in most of the 109 con­stituen­cies rep­re­sented by the op­po­si­tion, es­pe­cially in Penin­su­lar Malaysia, are eth­ni­cally mixed or ma­jor­ity non-bu­mi­put­era.</p>
    <p>“Umno can per­haps de­mand for seats won by Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad’s fac­tion,” a PN leader said, re­fer­ring to the for­mer premier who re­fused to lead PN in Fe­bru­ary and broke away from Ber­satu with six other MPs.</p>
    <p>“But with Ber­satu now a mul­tira­cial party, Umno has less claim over mixed ar­eas that it has tra­di­tion­ally handed to BN al­lies any­way.”</p>
    <p>Should Ber­satu suc­ceed in win­ning these mixed seats, it could end up be­ing PN’s largest party post elec­tions. It now has 31 MPs against Umno’s 39.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that Mr Azmin’s fac­tion has re­dou­bled its ef­forts to woo for­mer PH colleagues to cross over now that Ber­satu has opened its doors to non-bu­mi­put­eras.</p>
    <p>The for­mer PKR deputy pres­i­dent’s al­lies in the party had in­cluded at least seven other MPs and the ma­jor­ity of the cen­tral lead­er­ship com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>But many, es­pe­cially non-Malays, de­cided to stay in Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim’s PKR when Mr Azmin left in Fe­bru­ary af­ter years of en­mity with the op­po­si­tion leader whose promised as­cen­sion to the premier­ship – re­plac­ing Dr Ma­hathir un­der a PH deal – was scup­pered by the sud­den change in gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Should Ber­satu, es­pe­cially Mr Azmin’s sup­port­ers, end up con­test­ing the lion’s share of mixed seats, it will pit them di­rectly against PKR in an in­trigu­ing con­test between not just two Malay-led multi-eth­nic par­ties, but also Mr An­war and his for­mer pro­tege.</p>
    <p>READY TO PRO­CEED</p>
    <p>We will go ahead with five or six com­po­nents as this makes it the largest coali­tion of rul­ing par­ties, and we will use the PN logo for the Sabah polls. It is up to Umno whether it wants to fol­low suit. ’’</p>
