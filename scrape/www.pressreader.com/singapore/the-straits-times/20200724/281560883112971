    <p>Sec­ondary schools, ju­nior col­leges and Mil­len­nia In­sti­tute will have the op­tion of re­sum­ing lower-risk co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties (CCAs) from next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Sec­ondary schools, ju­nior col­leges and Mil­len­nia In­sti­tute will have the op­tion to re­sume lower-risk cocur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties (CCAs) from next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said yes­ter­day that “it is now timely to safely re­sume other im­por­tant as­pects of school life to sup­port holis­tic stu­dent de­vel­op­ment”.</p>
    <p>Such ac­tiv­i­ties in pri­mary schools will re­sume at a later date, af­ter the min­istry has as­sessed how the re­sump­tion of CCAs has worked out for older stu­dents.</p>
    <p>MOE noted that school ac­tiv­i­ties have been pro­gres­sively re­sum­ing over the past two months, and phys­i­cal lessons in schools have re­sumed at all lev­els. Stu­dents have also ad­justed well to the safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>CCAs and school ac­tiv­i­ties must ad­here to re­quired mea­sures – which may en­tail ad­just­ments to game for­mats and rules – be­fore they can re­sume. A max­i­mum of 20 stu­dents for each ac­tiv­ity will be al­lowed, and where pos­si­ble, the com­po­si­tion of par­tic­i­pants should be fixed to min­imise in­ter­min­gling.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, bad­minton CCAs may re­sume, with a max­i­mum of 20 par­tic­i­pants at each venue.</p>
    <p>Groups of five stu­dents or fewer can in­ter­act more closely dur­ing an ac­tiv­ity. For ex­am­ple, a group of five can work on a soft­ware pro­gramme in a com­puter lab, four can play dou­bles at ta­ble ten­nis, or two can play against two in a bas­ket­ball game.</p>
    <p>Mod­i­fied game rules will ap­ply, such as stu­dents hav­ing to re­main at least 1m apart, even dur­ing phys­i­cal ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Schools will con­tinue to screen all vis­i­tors – in­clud­ing coaches and in­struc­tors – for flu-like symp­toms, and en­sure that they com­ply with all safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Net­ball coach Justin Teh, 48, said he wel­comed the re­sump­tion of sport­ing ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“The key thing for sports is... if there’s some­thing wrong, we can cor­rect (the stu­dents) in real time.</p>
    <p>“When you’re on­line, it’s very hard to cor­rect their pos­ture, the way they pass, the way they move, so from now, it’s go­ing to be a lot eas­ier,” said Mr Teh, who coaches at Eunoia Ju­nior Col­lege and Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Girls’ School.</p>
    <p>Nanyang Ju­nior Col­lege girls’ vol­ley­ball cap­tain Tan Zhu Kou, 17, said her team is likely to hold one in-per­son train­ing ses­sion and two e-train­ing ses­sions next week.</p>
    <p>“Not be­ing able to train in real life... we could re­ally feel our skills de­te­ri­o­rat­ing... We could feel a dras­tic dif­fer­ence, like we had lost the touch and feel (of the ball),” said the JC1 stu­dent.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, CCAs and ac­tiv­i­ties that in­volve high lev­els of body con­tact, such as taek­wondo spar­ring and rugby scrums, or high ex­po­sure to aerosol and splat­ters, such as play­ing wind in­stru­ments or singing in a choir, will re­main sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiv­i­ties in­volv­ing in­ter­min­gling of stu­dents be­tween schools, as well as ac­tiv­i­ties held at ex­ter­nal venues, will also not be al­lowed.</p>
    <p>MOE said CCA ex­pe­ri­ences and school ac­tiv­i­ties are “im­por­tant el­e­ments of our stu­dents’ holis­tic de­vel­op­ment”.</p>
    <p>“They pro­vide our stu­dents more op­por­tu­ni­ties and plat­forms to ex­plore their pas­sion, build friend­ships and de­velop char­ac­ter and re­silience,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>But it added that “schools will still have flex­i­bil­ity in de­cid­ing when ac­tiv­i­ties will re­sume, while also en­sur­ing that the work­load of teach­ers and stu­dents re­mains man­age­able”.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion closely and re­view its plans in tan­dem with na­tional guide­lines.</p>
