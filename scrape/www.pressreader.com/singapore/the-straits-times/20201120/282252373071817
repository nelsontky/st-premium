    <p>A $181 mil­lion law­suit filed by United Over­seas Bank ( UOB) against de­vel­oper Lippo Ma­rina Col­lec­tion (LMC) and seven in­di­vid­u­als went to trial this week.</p>
    <p>UOB which com­menced le­gal pro­ceed­ings in 2015, is ac­cus­ing the sub­sidiary of In­done­sia’s Lippo Group of be­ing in­volved in a con­spir­acy with seven in­di­vid­u­als to get in­flated housing loans to buy­ers of con­do­minium units, and is seeking dam­ages and costs.</p>
    <p>The seven in­di­vid­u­als are Mr Goh Buck Lim, also known as Rick; Ms Aurel­lia Adri­anus Ho, also known as Filly; Rick’s sons Goh Han Rong Clarke and Goh You Wei Ewis; Filly’s daugh­ter Jen­nifer Janeth; Filly’s nephew Er­fan Syah Pu­tra and his wife Theodora Budi Hal­imund­jaja.</p>
    <p>The loans granted and dis­bursed be­tween De­cem­ber 2011 and Septem­ber 2013 were for the pur­chases of 38 units in the Ma­rina Col­lec­tion – a high-end water­front res­i­den­tial en­clave, de­vel­oped and sold by LMC.</p>
    <p>UOB’s lawyer Eddee Ng of Tan Kok Quan Part­ner­ship said the al­leged con­spir­acy helped LMC dis­pose of units in the face of dif­fi­cult mar­ket con­di­tions with the ac­tual price of the units be­ing fully fi­nanced by UOB.</p>
    <p>In his open­ing state­ment, Mr Ng said LMC saw strong sales when it was launched for sale around De­cem­ber 2007. But af­ter a se­ries of prop­erty cool­ing mea­sures in­tro­duced by the Gov­ern­ment i n 2009, sales fell from 30 units sold be­tween De­cem­ber 2007 and June 2008 to just nine units for the whole of 2010.</p>
    <p>LMC then hatched the al­leged con­spir­acy with ERA prop­erty agent Rick and free­lance prop­erty agent Filly.</p>
    <p>Elab­o­rat­ing on the al­leged con­spir­acy, Mr Ng said LMC gave sub­stan­tial “fur­ni­ture re­bates” of 22 per cent to 34 per cent, which were de­lib­er­ately con­cealed from UOB.</p>
    <p>The price of the prop­erty stated in the Op­tion to Pur­chase form was thus in­flated to the ex­tent of the fur­ni­ture re­bates.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the 38 pur­chasers were each granted loans of be­tween $4.2 mil­lion and $5 mil­lion, which were in ex­cess of the max­i­mum amounts per­mit­ted un­der Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Rick and Filly fa­cil­i­tated the al­leged con­spir­acy by procur­ing 32 of the 38 buy­ers to lend their names and act as fronts for the pur­chases of their re­spec­tive units with housing loans from UOB.</p>
    <p>To de­ceive UOB that these buy­ers have the means to fi­nance the housing loans, sums rang­ing from $200,000 to $1.2 mil­lion were round-tripped be­tween the UOB ac­counts of the buy­ers as as­sets un­der man­age­ment at the time of their l oan ap­pli­ca­tions. Hav­ing such as­sets was one of the cri­te­ria for the loans to be ap­proved.</p>
    <p>UOB said the loans were given out af­ter LMC’s lawyers con­firmed that the buy­ers had paid the re­main­der of the pur­chase price, when the re­main­der was in fact set off against the fur­ni­ture re­bates.</p>
    <p>The trial which started on Wed­nes­day is sched­uled to run 18 days.</p>
    <p>Three wit­nesses have given their tes­ti­monies in the first two days of the trial.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, LMC, de­fended by se­nior coun­sel Si­raj Omar of Drew & Napier, sug­gested that f ormer UOB em­ployee Ann Ong from the mort­gage sales team was aware of the fur­ni­ture re­bates and did not in­clude that in the loan ap­pli­ca­tion forms. Hence, the loan quan­tum was sig­nif­i­cantly larger, which was in Ms Ong’s in­ter­est, as she would have got a higher com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Un­der cross-ex­am­i­na­tion by Mr Omar, Ms Josephine Tan Pei Sze, who is team head of mort­gage sales, agreed that Ms Ong would have got higher com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“Yes, but by not much, I would as­sume,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan also agreed with Mr Omar that the sales rep­re­sen­ta­tive has a duty to ver­ify the iden­tity of the loan ap­pli­cants.</p>
    <p>Mr Omar then tried to show how UOB’s staff had been neg­li­gent by giv­ing an ex­am­ple of how Ms Ong could have pro­cessed one of the buyer’s loans with­out hav­ing met the buyer.</p>
