    <p>Work­ing adults and stu­dents look­ing for an al­ter­na­tive to work from home or study can book fully fur­nished suites that are equipped with high-speed In­ter­net ac­cess and other ameni­ties, as part of a new busi­ness ini­tia­tive by</p>
    <p>The As­cott Limited to counter the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Work­ing adults and stu­dents look­ing for an al­ter­na­tive to work from home or study can book fully fur­nished suites that are equipped with high-speed In­ter­net and other ameni­ties, as part of a new busi­ness ini­tia­tive by The As­cott to counter the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand’s wholly owned lodg­ing busi­ness unit has con­verted se­lected units at more than 60 of its prop­er­ties across 10 coun­tries into work suites, which can be booked on a daily, weekly or monthly ba­sis.</p>
    <p>The launch of this “work in res­i­dence” ini­tia­tive is aimed at “seiz­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties on the ris­ing telecom­mut­ing trend to of­fer a com­pre­hen­sive so­lu­tion for guests to live and work in a safe and pri­vate space”, said Mr Leong Teng Wui, As­cott’s chief de­vel­op­ment of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>lyf Fu­nan Sin­ga­pore is one of the prop­er­ties that of­fers this pack­age.</p>
    <p>Rates start from $70 a day for a work suite there, and it comes with a pri­vate workspace, high-speed Wi-Fi, a pri­vate en suite bath­room, a sta­tionery kit, as well as cof­fee, tea and snacks.</p>
    <p>The rates vary depend­ing on the du­ra­tion of use and lo­ca­tion, said an As­cott spokesman yesterday.</p>
    <p>As­cott is also op­ti­mis­ing the use of space in its prop­er­ties to of­fer new ser­vices in what it calls “spaceas-a-ser­vice”. It has joined hands with multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tions, en­trepreneur­s and small and medium-sized en­ter­prises to ex­plore the dif­fer­ent pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>These range from cloud kitchens and Star­bucks cof­fee kiosks, to par­cel col­lec­tion hubs and venues for live-stream­ing events and fit­ness ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, As­cott has part­nered a food tech com­pany to set up a cloud kitchen in lyf Fu­nan Sin­ga­pore’s shared kitchen to pro­vide in-house guests with more din­ing op­tions.</p>
    <p>As­cott has also part­nered Nes­tle to set up Star­bucks self-ser­vice kiosks in the lobby of its Ci­tadines prop­er­ties around the world.</p>
    <p>Ci­tadines Balestier Sin­ga­pore and Ci­tadines Fu­sio­nop­o­lis Sin­ga­pore are the first in the ser­viced res­i­dence in­dus­try here with these kiosks. They will be rolled out to the rest of the Ci­tadines prop­er­ties, start­ing with China, Malaysia and Ja­pan by the end of this year and Europe next year.</p>
    <p>In China, some apart­ments equipped with high-speed Wi-Fi have been con­verted into stu­dios that can be used by long-stay guests – who in­clude In­ter­net celebri­ties and those from new me­dia and ecom­merce com­pa­nies – for livestream events and photo shoots.</p>
    <p>In Viet­nam, se­lected apart­ments have been con­verted into yoga stu­dios, which can be re­served at spe­cial rates by in­struc­tors who want to con­duct classes.</p>
    <p>Mr Kevin Goh, Cap­i­taLand chief ex­ec­u­tive for lodg­ing and As­cott’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, said: “As­cott’s strengths in the long-stay seg­ment have bol­stered our re­silience against head­winds from the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion. We are evolv­ing our lodg­ing prod­ucts and ser­vices to cater to new cus­tomer seg­ments, un­cover al­ter­na­tive rev­enue streams as well as de­liver greater value for our guests and busi­ness part­ners.”</p>
