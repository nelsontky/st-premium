    <p>Liq­uid shine</p>
    <p>Patent leather is re­liv­ing its 1980s glory days with a vengeance. Throw on a vinyl-es­que coat for some oomph, slip into a slick jump­suit for a fuss-free get-up, or opt for a glossy ac­ces­sory (above) for a sleek fin­ish to your look. Noth­ing gives you pol­ish and at­ti­tude quite like gleam­ing leather.</p>
    <p>Think pink</p>
    <p>Add a dose of disco to even your most ca­sual looks with a sweet yet sassy metal­lic bag (above). Keep it pe­tite but big enough for daily es­sen­tials, with a gilded chain strap for ex­tra edge. This is an in­stant mood-lifter no mat­ter the weather.</p>
    <p>Hint of tint</p>
    <p>What started as yel­low-tinted lenses made for med­i­cal needs has since ex­panded into a spec­trum of rain­bow hues. From icy blue to blaz­ing or­ange (above), tinted lenses are just the punch you need to make a style state­ment.</p>
    <p>Nat­u­ral drama</p>
    <p>The grown-up sis­ter of girl­ish puff sleeves, bell sleeves (right) of­fer vol­ume at the fore­arm rather than the shoul­ders for just as flat­ter­ing a sil­hou­ette. Plus, they in­stantly add a hint of Vic­to­rian drama to any get-up.</p>
    <p>Blind­ing lights</p>
    <p>The new year calls for sparkly en­sem­bles. Shy of glit­ter or se­quins? Try metallics.</p>
    <p>Go for the full-on shine of a vo­lu­mi­nous one-tone jacket (right), a multi-hue pantsuit, the sub­tle sheen of a skirt, or a hint of re­flec­tion from a pair of boots – you de­cide the ef­fect.</p>
    <p>Go with the flow</p>
    <p>The unas­sum­ing house dress has been given a facelift, thanks to de­sign­ers who have el­e­vated the com­fort­able, fuss-free frock. Valentino (left) went with a silk ver­sion while Ba­len­ci­aga pre­sented a flo­ral num­ber paired with neon boots. Dress it up or down, wear it in­doors or out – we prom­ise you will look and feel your best.</p>
    <p>Cosmic won­der</p>
    <p>What bet­ter way to align your­self with the stars than with jew­ellery in­spired by the cos­mos?</p>
    <p>With bold shapes, pow­er­ful lines and a trove of coloured gems, Louis Vuit­ton’s Stel­lar Times (above) of­fers state­ment pieces that go just as well with tees and jeans as they do a gown fit for the red car­pet.</p>
    <p>Earth and fire</p>
    <p>Show off your pas­sion­ate side with gems that take their fiery colour cues from molten lava.</p>
    <p>The Mauna range (above) from Cartier’s Mag­ni­tude col­lec­tion mar­ries a trea­sure chest of pre­cious stones with geo­met­ric forms for a time­less por­trayal of mod­ern ex­u­ber­ance.</p>
    <p>Pur­ple rain</p>
    <p>Whether as a dar­ling pas­tel or a vivid vi­o­let, pur­ple is the colour of the mo­ment. It is a bolder – and, some would say, more fash­ion­able – al­ter­na­tive to pink.</p>
    <p>Add pops of the hue in the form of an ev­ery­day bag (left) and court pumps, or go all out with a fully se­quinned num­ber in a sin­gle loud colour.</p>
    <p>Save the day</p>
    <p>A cape has the power to make you feel in­vin­ci­ble.</p>
    <p>Put a spin on the su­per­hero sta­ple by don­ning a cape-blazer hy­brid or a one-shoul­der cape-top (above) fash­ioned from a silky shawl. Ef­fort­lessly chic, it in­stantly pulls to­gether a look, with the draped ef­fect adding a cool fac­tor to a clas­sic en­sem­ble.</p>
    <p>Plush and lush</p>
    <p>Vel­vet pieces are no longer re­served for af­ter-dark mo­ments.</p>
    <p>Let them shine in day­light by throw­ing a plush blazer over cor­po­rate wear or add vis­ual in­ter­est with a pair of In­sta­gram-wor­thy heels for an el­e­vated twist. End the day with a lav­ish py­ja­mas set to com­plete the lux­u­ri­ously in­dul­gent ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>High ground</p>
    <p>Af­ter back-to-back sea­sons of flats, plat­forms are fi­nally mak­ing a come­back – from clas­sic san­dals (left) to mod­ernised sneak­ers and tra­di­tional slip­pers. Take your pick and stand tall.</p>
