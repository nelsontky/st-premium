    <p>About 90 breast can­cer pa­tients may have re­ceived un­nec­es­sary treat­ment since 2012 due to in­ac­cu­rate test re­sults, Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal (KTPH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Side ef­fects from the drug given to the af­fected pa­tients may in­clude di­ar­rhoea, chills and fever. In about 3 per cent to 4 per cent of cases, pa­tients may also ex­pe­ri­ence heart prob­lems.</p>
    <p>The Ministry of Health said yes­ter­day that it takes a se­ri­ous view of the in­ci­dent and has re­quested the hos­pi­tal re­view other lab­o­ra­tory pro­to­cols be­yond those for the af­fected tests as a safety pre­cau­tion.</p>
    <p>It added that KTPH is sub­ject to reg­u­la­tions for pri­vate hos­pi­tals and med­i­cal clin­ics which en­sure its fa­cil­i­ties and pro­cesses to re­solve lab­o­ra­tory is­sues are in place.</p>
    <p>“Ap­pro­pri­ate en­force­ment ac­tion will be taken if a breach of pro­to­col is found,” said the ministry.</p>
    <p>In an ear­lier state­ment yes­ter­day, KTPH said it es­ti­mated 180 pa­tients may have got the wrong test re­sults. Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions sug­gest an in­cor­rect stain­ing process for the hu­man epi­der­mal growth fac­tor re­cep­tor 2 (HER2) test was the cause. The HER2 test is used to de­ter­mine how ag­gres­sive the breast can­cer is likely to be so that med­i­cal</p>
    <p>PRO­VID­ING SUP­PORT</p>
    <p>I would like to con­vey my deep­est apolo­gies to all the af­fected pa­tients, their fam­i­lies and their treat­ing on­col­o­gists. I am very sorry that they have to go through this. We will pro­vide all the nec­es­sary sup­port and as­sis­tance, and will do our best to take care of them.</p>
    <p>practition­ers can pre­scribe the right treat­ment for pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Since the is­sue with the test was dis­cov­ered, the hos­pi­tal said it has iden­ti­fied all af­fected pa­tients, and their sam­ples dat­ing back to 2012 have been sent to var­i­ous ex­ter­nal lab­o­ra­to­ries to ex­pe­dite re-test­ing.</p>
    <p>As some of the re-test re­sults re­turn, the hos­pi­tal has be­gun reach­ing out per­son­ally to pa­tients and their treat­ing on­col­o­gists to of­fer sup­port. This process of con­tact­ing pa­tients is still on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>To en­sure pa­tient safety, the hos­pi­tal has stopped in-house HER2 test­ing in its lab­o­ra­tory.</p>
    <p>KTPH said it re­ported the in­ci­dent to Na­tional Health­care Group (NHG) on Nov 22, and to the Health Ministry on Nov 24. Since then, NHG has con­vened an in­de­pen­dent re­view com­mit­tee, which in­cludes ex­ter­nal ex­perts, to do a thor­ough re­view of how the in­ci­dent oc­curred to im­prove the process and pre­vent a re­cur­rence of sim­i­lar in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Said Mrs Chew Kwee Tiang, chief ex­ec­u­tive of KTPH: “I would like to con­vey my deep­est apolo­gies to all the af­fected pa­tients, their fam­i­lies and their treat­ing on­col­o­gists.</p>
    <p>“I am very sorry that they have to go through this. We will pro­vide all the nec­es­sary sup­port and as­sis­tance, and will do our best to take care of them.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Rebecca Dent, who heads the med­i­cal on­col­ogy di­vi­sion at the Na­tional Can­cer</p>
    <p>MRS CHEW KWEE TIANG, chief ex­ec­u­tive of KTPH.</p>
    <p>Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore, told The Straits Times that the af­fected pa­tients were “over-treated”, but this should not af­fect their out­comes or prog­no­sis.</p>
    <p>She said the side ef­fects of the drug used are tem­po­rary and re­versible. The pa­tients would have been mon­i­tored and any who ex­pe­ri­enced more se­vere side ef­fects af­fect­ing heart func­tion would have been re­ferred to a car­di­ol­o­gist.</p>
    <p>While the af­fected sam­ples date back to 2012, Prof Dent said no pa­tient would be given HER2-di­rected ther­apy for an eight-year pe­riod. She added: “HER2-di­rected ther­apy is typ­i­cally given for a to­tal du­ra­tion of one year in non­metastatic breast can­cer and in cer­tain sit­u­a­tions of high-risk dis­ease, pa­tients may be treated with ex­tended HER2-di­rected ther­apy for up to two years.”</p>
