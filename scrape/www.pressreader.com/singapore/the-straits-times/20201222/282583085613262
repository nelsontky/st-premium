    <p>LON­DON • Cham­pi­ons Liver­pool re­main the team to beat in the Premier League but with only a five­point gap sep­a­rat­ing the lead­ers and third-placed Manch­ester United, the ti­tle race is still rel­a­tively wide open.</p>
    <p>A win in their next top-flight game at Le­ices­ter on Satur­day will see the Red Devils, who also have a game in hand, leapfrog them into sec­ond.</p>
    <p>Two home league games against mid-ta­ble op­po­si­tion i n As­ton Villa and Wolves round out their Christ­mas sched­ule. Should United get through those en­coun­ters with max­i­mum points, they will set them­selves up for a pos­si­ble top-of-the-ta­ble clash at An­field on Jan 17.</p>
    <p>Six wins from as many away games have lent cre­dence to their be­lief and United are on a 10-game league win streak on their trav­els dat­ing back to last sea­son, the first team to do so since Tot­ten­ham in 1960.</p>
    <p>Un­til Sun­day, their home form – one win in six pre­vi­ous games – had let them down, but Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer’s side fi­nally car­ried over their road form to the Theatre of Dreams.</p>
    <p>In the first league meet­ing be­tween United and bit­ter ri­vals Leeds in al­most 17 years, the hosts blew their op­po­nents away, with Scott McTom­i­nay scor­ing twice in­side three min­utes en route to a 6-2 rout.</p>
    <p>An­other dou­ble by Bruno Fer­nan­des and goals by Daniel James and Vic­tor Lin­de­lof put away the vis­i­tors, who scored through Liam Cooper and Stuart Dal­las.</p>
    <p>Since los­ing at home to Arse­nal on Nov 1, United have won six and drawn one of their last seven league games, drop­ping points only against Manch­ester City. But the dis­play against Leeds was their best in that run, purred Sol­sk­jaer.</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian said: “It could have been 12-4, it was that kind of game. It was fan­tas­tic from the first minute. We had a plan to get af­ter them, go for­ward.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been crit­i­cised for our starts but the boys were pre­pared. We’ve ap­proached the game re­ally well, we’ve looked at videos and looked at ways to ex­ploit them but also ways to stop them hurt­ing you. It was a great start.</p>
    <p>“Just imag­ine if that had 75,000 peo­ple here. It would have gone down as one of the best United per­for­mances against Leeds.”</p>
    <p>Doubts re­main over United’s con­sis­tency and de­fence as Marcelo Bielsa’s men could have had plenty more than two goals to show for their verve.</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer also sought to tem­per the grow­ing be­lief his side are best placed to chal­lenge Liver­pool for the ti­tle. One more for the Reds will match United’s tally of 20.</p>
    <p>“It’s 13 games into the sea­son – we’re a work in progress,” he said. “We’re getting bet­ter, we’re getting fit­ter and stronger but there’s still a few de­tails to nail and let’s talk about the ti­tle later on.”</p>
    <p>But pun­dits are be­gin­ning to share the op­ti­mism build­ing at Old Traf­ford that Sol­sk­jaer’s men are not just dark horses but gen­uine ti­tle con­tenders for the first time since 2012-13.</p>
    <p>For­mer United cap­tain Roy Keane told Sky Sports: “I think over the last few months they’ve been heav­ily crit­i­cised, par­tic­u­larly over the home record.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been quite crit­i­cal of the back four, the goal­keeper, ques­tion­ing where this team is go­ing but the name of this game is prov­ing peo­ple wrong.</p>
    <p>“Maybe, just maybe, this group of play­ers can do that. United are in a great po­si­tion con­sid­er­ing how slow they were out of the blocks.</p>
    <p>“If United can get their house in order at home, there’s no rea­son why United can’t stay up there.</p>
    <p>“I think Liver­pool are still the best, but there’s no rea­son why United shouldn’t be fan­cy­ing their chances in terms of push­ing Liver­pool.”</p>
    <p>GOOD PROSPECTS</p>
    <p>Maybe, just maybe, this group of play­ers can do that. United are in a great po­si­tion con­sid­er­ing how slow they were out of the blocks.</p>
