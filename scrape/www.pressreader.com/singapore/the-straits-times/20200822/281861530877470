    <p>For weeks, opin­ion polls have con­sis­tently shown for­mer US vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den ahead of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump for the Nov 3 elec­tion. And though the range has var­ied, he has re­mained in the lead.</p>
    <p>But a re­cur­ring night­mare among Democrats is a re­peat of 2016, when polls showed</p>
    <p>Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton would tri­umph, only to see Mr Trump nar­rowly take a hand­ful of key states and thus win the Elec­toral Col­lege.</p>
    <p>So, how re­li­able are these polls? How are they usu­ally con­ducted? Which are the ones to fol­low? US Bureau Chief Nir­mal Ghosh ex­plains.</p>
    <p>MANY UN­DER­ES­TI­MATED THE CHANCES OF TRUMP’S WIN IN 2016</p>
    <p>There are good polls, and bad or sloppy polls, and ev­ery poll has a mar­gin of er­ror.</p>
    <p>A sin­gle polling ques­tion rarely cap­tures a com­pli­cated hu­man be­ing’s opin­ions on com­pli­cated is­sues, some of which the per­son may not even know much about. So it is al­ways bet­ter to take an av­er­age of sev­eral polls that are con­sid­ered at least method­olog­i­cally sound.</p>
    <p>In 2016, prob­lems with polls in a few key Mid­west­ern states led to many un­der­es­ti­mat­ing the chances of a Trump vic­tory.</p>
    <p>The im­me­di­ate post-elec­tion as­sess­ment was that there had been a com­plete polling fail­ure. But that is an over­state­ment. The 2016 polls were not wrong on a national ba­sis.</p>
    <p>An av­er­age of fi­nal, pub­licly re­leased national polls pointed to Mrs Clin­ton win­ning the over­all pop­u­lar vote by three per­cent­age points – and she did, by two points.</p>
    <p>“The polls were ac­tu­ally quite good,” Mr John Zogby, se­nior part­ner at John Zogby Strate­gies – who did not poll in 2016 – told The Straits Times. Al­most ev­ery poll came close na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>“I hon­estly be­lieve that talk­ing heads sim­ply could not con­ceive of a Trump vic­tory and the herd men­tal­ity just as­sumed a Clin­ton vic­tory. They were blind­sided by their own my­opia – not by the polls.”</p>
    <p>WHAT WENT WRONG IN 2016?</p>
    <p>One key mis­take, ac­cord­ing to an anal­y­sis pub­lished by Pew Re­search, was that many state poll­sters did not ad­just to re­flect that col­lege grad­u­ates are more likely to take sur­veys than adults with less for­mal ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>This mat­tered more than in pre­vi­ous years, when there weren’t big par­ti­san dif­fer­ences be­tween the two groups. In 2016, the more ed­u­cated went for Mrs Clin­ton, and the less ed­u­cated, who had not fin­ished high school, went for Mr Trump. State polls that did not ad­just their data by ed­u­ca­tion were left with a bi­ased sam­ple.</p>
    <p>Also, un­de­cided vot­ers swung more to­wards Mr Trump than to Mrs Clin­ton in the last few days be­fore the elec­tion – but most state polls did not de­tect that sim­ply be­cause they had stopped polling.</p>
    <p>HOW ARE POLLS CON­DUCTED?</p>
    <p>Polling is con­ducted largely by phone in­ter­views over land lines or mo­bile phones and some­times via both; au­to­mated “robopolls”, tech­ni­cally called “in­ter­ac­tive voice re­sponse”; and over the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>SO SHOULD WE WATCH THE POLLS – AND WHICH ARE THE BEST TO FOL­LOW?</p>
    <p>“I think the polls are do­ing well,” Mr Zogby told ST.</p>
    <p>“We poll­sters have to as­sume a turnout model and that is where some of the dif­fer­ences arise. How many Democrats or Repub­li­cans should be in the sam­ple? 18- to 29-year-olds? Non-whites? Some as­sump­tions need to be made.</p>
    <p>“And some poll­sters are bet­ter than oth­ers. I be­lieve in on­line polls – I was one of the pi­o­neers. But I also think that live tele­phone polls can still be ac­cu­rate.”</p>
    <p>But he added: “We need to re­call that polls are still only a pho­to­graph of a mo­ment in time – not a pre­dic­tion, es­pe­cially with so much left to the cam­paign.”</p>
    <p>The web­sites Five Thirty Eight, and Real Clear Pol­i­tics, are among those that track a daily or weekly av­er­age of polls.</p>
