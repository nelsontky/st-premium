    <p>There were 18 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,091.</p>
    <p>All were im­ported cases and had been placed on stay-home no­tices (SHN) on arrival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>They com­prised two per­ma­nent residents, four work pass hold­ers, 10 work per­mit hold­ers, one de­pen­dant’s pass holder and one spe­cial pass holder.</p>
    <p>This is the high­est num­ber of im­ported cases since April 1 when 19 had the virus.</p>
    <p>The two per­ma­nent residents in­cluded a 40-year-old man who ar­rived from In­dia and a 22-yearold woman who trav­elled from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Of the 14 em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, 10 are for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers who re­turned from Myan­mar and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The four work pass hold­ers who tested pos­i­tive for the virus ar­rived from the Nether­lands, Switzer­land and Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>The de­pen­dant’s pass holder is a 23-year-old woman who re­turned from Nepal, while the spe­cial pass holder is a 35-year-old man who ar­rived from Rus­sia to board a ship docked here as a crew mem­ber.</p>
    <p>All of them were tested while serv­ing their SHN.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries, added MOH.</p>
    <p>The sero­log­i­cal test re­sult for the 25-year-old Malaysian who was iden­ti­fied as a com­mu­nity case on Tues­day has come back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>The man was tested twice us­ing the poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test.</p>
    <p>He works as a cleaner at an of­fice build­ing at PaxOcean Sin­ga­pore ship­yard, which is has been linked to a pre­vi­ous case, but there are no in­di­ca­tions that they had in­ter­acted.</p>
    <p>MOH said the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with a to­tal of two cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>Both cases are cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>With five cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,975 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 33 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 40 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
