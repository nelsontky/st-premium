    <p>BEIRUT • Is­lamists and al­lied rebels in north-western Syria yes­ter­day killed at least 12 pro-regime fighters, thwart­ing their ad­vance, a war mon­i­tor­ing group said.</p>
    <p>An­other 17 pro-regime fighters were in­jured, while on the Is­lamis­tled side, six fighters died, said the Bri­tain-based group, Syr­ian Ob­ser­va­tory for Hu­man Rights.</p>
    <p>The forces loyal to Pres­i­dent Bashar-al As­sad had launched an at­tack with ar­tillery and heavy gun­fire in Syria’s last ma­jor op­po­si­tion bastion, said the war mon­i­tor.</p>
    <p>But the Is­lamist Hayat Tahrir alSham (HTS) al­liance – headed by for­mer lead­ers of Syria’s one-time Al-Qaeda af­fil­i­ate – and their al­lies re­port­edly thwarted the ad­vance.</p>
    <p>Four HTS and two other rebel fighters were killed in the clashes in a ru­ral area of Latakia prov­ince, the mon­i­tor said.</p>
    <p>The HTS-led al­liance also con­trols large ar­eas of Idlib prov­ince and sliv­ers of ter­ri­tory in neigh­bour­ing Aleppo and Hama.</p>
    <p>The re­gion they hold is home to about three mil­lion peo­ple, nearly half of whom have been dis­placed from other parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Syria’s nine-year-old war has killed more than 380,000 peo­ple and dis­placed nearly half of the coun­try’s pre-war pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The rebel-held area is a reg­u­lar tar­get of at­tacks by regime forces and their Rus­sian and Ira­nian al­lies.</p>
    <p>A Rus­sian-backed gov­ern­ment of­fen­sive be­tween last De­cem­ber and March dis­placed nearly a mil­lion peo­ple in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Although a cease­fire agree­ment backed by Moscow in March has re­duced vi­o­lence in the area, shelling and air strikes by the regime and its back­ers con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian air strikes on the town of Bin­nish in Idlib prov­ince killed three peo­ple from the same fam­ily yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to the mon­i­tor.</p>
