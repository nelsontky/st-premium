    <p>A law will be passed to for­malise as­sur­ances made ear­lier that data from TraceTo­gether, if needed for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions, can be used to look into only seven cat­e­gories of se­ri­ous of­fences, in­clud­ing kid­nap­ping, rape and mur­der. The leg­is­la­tion will be in­tro­duced in the next Par­lia­ment sit­ting next month on a cer­tifi­cate of ur­gency.</p>
    <p>A law will be passed to for­malise as­sur­ances made ear­lier that data from the Covid-19 TraceTo­gether con­tact trac­ing pro­gramme, if needed for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions, can be used to look into only se­ri­ous of­fences in­clud­ing mur­der, ter­ror­ism and rape.</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­tion will be in­tro­duced in the next sit­ting of Par­lia­ment next month on a Cer­tifi­cate of Ur­gency, said the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Of­fice (SNDGO) yes­ter­day. This means that the pro­posed law is ur­gent enough to be put through all three read­ings in one par­lia­men­tary sit­ting, in­stead of sep­a­rate ses­sions.</p>
    <p>SNDGO said the leg­is­la­tion will spec­ify that per­sonal data col­lected through dig­i­tal con­tact trac­ing so­lu­tions, which com­prise the TraceTo­gether and SafeEn­try pro­grammes, can be used only for con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is an ex­cep­tion – when there is a “clear and press­ing” need to use that data for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions into seven cat­e­gories of se­ri­ous of­fences.</p>
    <p>“It is not in the public in­ter­est to com­pletely deny the po­lice ac­cess to such data, when the safety of the public or the proper con­duct of jus­tice is at stake,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>“If a se­ri­ous crim­i­nal of­fence has been com­mit­ted, the po­lice must be able to use this data to bring the per­pe­tra­tors to jus­tice, seek re­dress for the vic­tims and pro­tect so­ci­ety at large.”</p>
    <p>SNDGO also said: “We ac­knowl­edge our er­ror in not stat­ing that data from TraceTo­gether is not ex­empt from the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code (CPC).”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier last year, the Gov­ern­ment had said that TraceTo­gether data would be used only for con­tact trac­ing in Sin­ga­pore’s fight against the pan­demic. More than 4.2 mil­lion peo­ple, or about 78 per cent of res­i­dents here, have down­loaded the TraceTo­gether app or col­lected the to­kens.</p>
    <p>The app and to­kens ex­change Blue­tooth sig­nals in an en­crypted and ran­domised form with nearby users to quickly track peo­ple ex­posed to con­firmed Covid-19 cases. The data, when un­en­crypted, is linked to a per­son’s phone num­ber and other iden­ti­fi­ca­tion de­tails.</p>
    <p>The con­tro­versy flared up on Mon­day when Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Desmond Tan told Par­lia­ment that TraceTo­gether data could be ac­cessed for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions un­der the CPC.</p>
    <p>This prompted public crit­i­cism over whether this was an about­turn in the use of data col­lected.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, For­eign Min­is­ter Vivian Balakr­ish­nan, who over­sees the Smart Na­tion drive, and Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam told Par­lia­ment that the data col­lected will be used with ut­most re­straint.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, there were calls by some on­line for oth­ers to stop us­ing or re­turn their TraceTo­gether app or to­kens, cit­ing con­cerns that the Gov­ern­ment had back­tracked on ear­lier as­sur­ances.</p>
    <p>SNDGO’s state­ment yes­ter­day said: “We value the trust that the public has placed in the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme, and feed­back from mem­bers of the public.”</p>
    <p>It added that Dr Balakr­ish­nan and Mr Shan­mugam held a public con­sul­ta­tion yes­ter­day with mem­bers of the me­dia, the le­gal fra­ter­nity, tech­nol­ogy ex­perts and aca­demics to hear their views.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Ste­fanie Yuen Thio told The Straits Times that the Gov­ern­ment was open about ad­mit­ting that its orig­i­nal in­for­ma­tion was not com­pletely ac­cu­rate, and added: “I hope that we can, as a na­tion, now go back to fo­cus­ing on the press­ing is­sue of fight­ing the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Ob­servers and MPs yes­ter­day wel­comed the news that the law would be amended to limit the use of TraceTo­gether data in crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions to seven types of se­ri­ous of­fences such as mur­der, kid­nap­ping and se­ri­ous sex­ual crimes.</p>
    <p>They said the move would help to ad­dress con­cerns over pri­vacy that had arisen since Mon­day, when Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Desmond Tan told Par­lia­ment that data col­lected by the con­tact trac­ing sys­tem to com­bat Covid-19 can be used by the po­lice un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Eugene Tan of the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity said the move to de­fine clearly in the law the cir­cum­stances un­der which po­lice can use TraceTo­gether data should as­suage con­cerns over how much ac­cess the au­thor­i­ties have to such data.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Nom­i­nated MP said there will still be peo­ple who take the view that TraceTo­gether data should be used purely for con­tact trac­ing, and there could be lin­ger­ing sus­pi­cion even with the pro­posed re­stric­tions to limit its use.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, the lat­est devel­op­ment should help re­fo­cus public at­ten­tion and en­ergy to­wards fight­ing Covid-19, he added.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s an­nounce­ment came soon af­ter Mr Tan’s re­ply to a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion from Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC MP Christo­pher de Souza on Mon­day sparked public crit­i­cism, prompt­ing For­eign Min­is­ter Vivian Balakr­ish­nan, who over­sees the Smart Na­tion ef­fort, and Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam to clar­ify the Gov­ern­ment’s po­si­tion a day later.</p>
    <p>The Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Of­fice said last night that leg­is­la­tion will be passed next month to spec­ify that per­sonal data col­lected through the TraceTo­gether and SafeEn­try pro­grammes can be used only for con­tact trac­ing, ex­cept where the po­lice have to ac­cess it to in­ves­ti­gate seven cat­e­gories of se­ri­ous of­fences.</p>
    <p>MacPher­son MP Tin Pei Ling said that since Tues­day’s ex­change in Par­lia­ment, a small num­ber of her res­i­dents had ex­pressed their con­cerns about the use of TraceTo­gether data and the need for safe­guards, with one sug­gest­ing that the crimes for which po­lice can ob­tain such data should be spelt out.</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­tion is a de­fin­i­tive move to dis­pel any doubt, she said.</p>
    <p>“Once the de­tails are out, it should be very clear what the process is go­ing to be like, what are the spe­cific cat­e­gories of crimes that will al­low so­lic­i­ta­tion of this data, so it will leave noth­ing to the imag­i­na­tion,” she added.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the re­marks in Par­lia­ment, sev­eral mem­bers of the public had ac­cused the Gov­ern­ment of not be­ing up­front, say­ing that the im­pres­sion given when TraceTo­gether was in­tro­duced last year was that data col­lected would be used only for con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Dr Balakr­ish­nan ac­knowl­edged in Par­lia­ment he had mis­spo­ken when he said last year that the data would be used only for con­tact trac­ing, and added that the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code was not on his mind when he spoke then.</p>
    <p>To this, Mr de Souza said yes­ter­day: “I lis­tened to ev­ery word of Dr Vivian Balakr­ish­nan’s re­ply on Tues­day and I be­lieve him – he had not con­sid­ered the CPC when he spoke of the am­bit of TraceTo­gether in June 2020.”</p>
    <p>He also said of the pro­posed curbs to re­strict the use of data in po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions to seven se­ri­ous crimes: “It speaks of trans­parency and has the added value of re­strict­ing the use of data. It is a pos­i­tive, trans­par­ent and timely move.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Work­ers’ Party MP Ger­ald Giam, who had ex­pressed con­cern that not ex­empt­ing TraceTo­gether data un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code would dis­cour­age use of the con­tact trac­ing sys­tem, said: “We will study the Bill when it is tabled in Par­lia­ment and for­mu­late our re­sponse ac­cord­ingly.”</p>
    <p>Some ob­servers had also felt that lim­it­ing the use of the data would help bal­ance the need to fight Covid-19 with the need to fight se­ri­ous crime.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Ste­fanie Yuen Thio said the se­ri­ous na­ture of the crimes listed makes clear that the po­lice will rely on TraceTo­gether data only in cases of ut­most ne­ces­sity.</p>
    <p>“It is also im­por­tant to bear in mind that ev­ery mem­ber of the public has a very strong in­ter­est to en­sure that crim­i­nals who com­mit such se­ri­ous of­fences are brought to jus­tice,” she added.</p>
    <p>“We should also bear in mind that just as TraceTo­gether data can in­crim­i­nate, it can also prove in­no­cence, such as when a to­ken user was not in the vicin­ity of the vic­tim dur­ing the com­mis­sion of a crime.”</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nal lawyer Su­nil Sud­heesan said TraceTo­gether data could be use­ful for in­ves­ti­ga­tions in crimes that are not pre­med­i­tated, such as a spon­ta­neous fight in a club that ends in some­one be­ing killed.</p>
    <p>He added: “All Sin­ga­pore­ans don’t want a per­son guilty of se­ri­ous crimes to get away scot-free.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some peo­ple were still un­easy over how con­tact trac­ing data would be used, de­spite yes­ter­day’s state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Aloy­sius Low, 39, founder of tech­nol­ogy re­view site Can Buy or Not, who has been urg­ing peo­ple to delete or stop us­ing the TraceTo­gether app since Mon­day, said that it is a good thing the Gov­ern­ment is leg­is­lat­ing the use of the data.</p>
    <p>But he is wor­ried there is still not enough as­sur­ance that the law will not be amended in the fu­ture to ex­pand the use of the data.</p>
    <p>Mr Sud­heesan said Sin­ga­pore had lever­aged tech­nol­ogy well for con­tact trac­ing, and he found it dis­ap­point­ing that peo­ple have started delet­ing the TraceTo­gether app.</p>
    <p>“There will be some resid­ual re­sent­ment,” he noted. “And peo­ple may need (some time) to purge them­selves of this anger.”</p>
