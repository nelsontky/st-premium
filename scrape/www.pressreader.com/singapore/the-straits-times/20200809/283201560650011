    <p>In­stead of try­ing to time the mar­ket, ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist Martin Berry prefers to ac­quire a small po­si­tion in as­sets that he likes and track it be­fore de­cid­ing whether to in­crease his ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>One of the gems the Aus­tralian counts as his best in­vest­ment was ac­quir­ing the fran­chise for Tai­wan bub­ble tea chain Gong Cha in South Korea.</p>
    <p>“While I knew noth­ing about bub­ble tea, I could see it was a very eco­nom­i­cally at­trac­tive busi­ness that could scale,” says Mr Berry, 43.</p>
    <p>In just un­der three years, the chain had 400 stores, prompt­ing Mr Berry to make his next move – a part­ner­ship in 2017 with a pri­vate eq­uity firm to buy out Gong Cha’s global oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>He and his part­ners then sold the com­pany to United States pri­vate eq­uity firm TA As­so­ciates last year to reap a near five-fold in­crease on his ini­tial in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>His next step was to set up ven­ture firm Dtribe Cap­i­tal to in­vest in early-stage com­pa­nies, with a fo­cus on dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion so­lu­tions and dig­i­tal health tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Mr Berry, who is mar­ried with a son, adds that one of his big­gest in­sights in re­cent months has been just how un­pre­pared many busi­nesses were for a sit­u­a­tion like the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He says the level of un­pre­pared­ness shows how most firms, re­gard­less of size or in­dus­try, un­der­in­vested in dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion de­spite the im­por­tance of it be­ing talked about for years.</p>
    <p>“The op­por­tu­nity for these busi­nesses is to use this as a ma­jor cat­a­lyst to get the job done, dig­i­talise their pro­cesses and make their or­gan­i­sa­tion more ef­fi­cient and eas­ier for cus­tomers to find them and do busi­ness with them, made even stronger by the gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts to help sup­port this trans­for­ma­tion,” Mr Berry notes.</p>
    <p>His ven­ture firm uses sev­eral key met­rics to as­sess start-ups: the to­tal ad­dress­able mar­ket, the founder’s char­ac­ter­is­tics and pas­sion, val­i­da­tion of the prod­uct in the mar­ket, and whether the prod­uct is in at­trac­tive seg­ments with high de­grees of prof­itabil­ity.</p>
    <p>His ad­vice to young en­trepreneur­s? “Be­fore you jump deep into some­thing, you re­ally need to go through a ro­bust process of seek­ing in­de­pen­dent val­i­da­tion as to the qual­ity of the busi­ness you want to start.”</p>
    <p>He has seen many peo­ple who are in love with the idea of be­ing an en­tre­pre­neur or with the con­cept they have de­vel­oped, while those close to them en­cour­age them re­gard­less of the qual­ity of the idea.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult, I see a lot of peo­ple try­ing to do things that, from an out­sider’s per­spec­tive, will not cut it and it be­comes a ma­jor op­por­tu­nity cost for those peo­ple and po­ten­tial fi­nan­cial bur­den,” he adds.</p>
    <p>“So if you want to be an en­tre­pre­neur, take your time, study it well and seek val­i­da­tion.”</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your per­sonal port­fo­lio? A I own a bit of ev­ery­thing across both pub­lic and pri­vate mar­kets. It is my way of keep­ing an eye on what is work­ing, what is not, and ad­just­ing ac­cord­ingly. Diver­si­fi­ca­tion is a les­son that con­tin­ues to with­stand the test of time.</p>
    <p>On the fixed-in­come side, I have a large al­lo­ca­tion to global wealth man­ager Pimco and, on the eq­ui­ties end, I have po­si­tions in Franklin Tech­nol­ogy Fund and dis­rup­tive in­no­va­tion ex­change­traded fund (ETF) ARKK.</p>
    <p>Most of my in­vest­ments are made out of Sin­ga­pore but are global. Sin­ga­pore is a highly at­trac­tive place to in­vest from, with one of the ma­jor ben­e­fits be­ing the wide avail­abil­ity of prod­ucts you can in­vest in, cre­at­ing sig­nif­i­cant op­por­tu­ni­ties to ac­cess var­i­ous as­set classes and prod­uct types.</p>
    <p>It is im­por­tant to have diver­si­fi­ca­tion across as­set classes, prod­uct types, is­suers and ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The long term on my pub­li­clisted port­fo­lio is slightly above mar­ket, thanks to a strong skew to­wards tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies with an aver­age an­nual re­turn of about 10 per cent per an­num.</p>
    <p>The real en­gine is on the pri­vate port­fo­lio side where, for ex­am­ple, we have made over 50 ven­ture in­vest­ments with an aver­age re­turn of close to two to three times in­vested cap­i­tal so far.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy. A Diver­si­fi­ca­tion is key and not in a tra­di­tional sense of bonds ver­sus eq­ui­ties, but much broader than that, in­clud­ing an al­lo­ca­tion to pri­vate mar­kets. Plant small seeds, test and learn and adapt ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>Ex­am­ples in­clude en­sur­ing your eq­uity port­fo­lio has an ex­po­sure to the old and new econ­omy and to even turbo-charge it with a small al­lo­ca­tion to the theme of dis­rup­tive in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Check out the ETF in the US with the ticker ARKK, which has de­liv­ered aver­age an­nual re­turns of 17 per cent per an­num since in­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>While the risk/re­turn char­ac­ter­is­tics of pri­vate mar­kets are dif­fer­ent, they are of­ten non-cor­re­lated to pub­lic mar­kets and can of­fer ex­po­sure to a whole new as­set class of early-stage and emerg­ing com­pa­nies that have the po­ten­tial to be game chang­ers over the long term.</p>
    <p>Q What are your im­me­di­ate in­vest­ment plans?</p>
    <p>A In a busi­ness con­text, to con­tinue to iden­tify and part­ner with smart founders in the re­gion do­ing great things that im­prove con­sumers’ lives.</p>
    <p>From a per­sonal port­fo­lio per­spec­tive, I will prob­a­bly trim some eq­uity po­si­tions back to cash given they have had an in­cred­i­ble run lately, while many of the data points I see in the phys­i­cal world don’t look overly pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A Mak­ing money never gets old and it is not about the ma­te­ri­al­is­tic sense, but as a lit­mus test for all you are as an in­vestor – learn­ing what you are good at and what you are not.</p>
    <p>I the­o­ret­i­cally started in­vest­ing at the age of 12 when I asked my fa­ther if he could lend me $100 and help me buy a few stocks. He did not do so, but I ran­domly chose a few stocks from the news­pa­per, tried to un­der­stand what they were and did, and tracked them un­til I got bored of it about six months later.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing that pe­riod, they were per­form­ing rea­son­ably well, but most im­por­tantly I had some key take­aways about volatil­ity and the need to di­ver­sify.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A I have no plans to re­tire; I love build­ing busi­nesses and to me it’s not con­sid­ered work.</p>
    <p>I think we all need some­thing in our lives that helps us get in­tel­lec­tual stim­u­la­tion and keep a de­gree of dis­ci­pline by hav­ing some­thing to fo­cus on and peo­ple to look af­ter. For me that’s busi­ness, it’s what I love do­ing and what keeps me ex­cited and chal­lenged. I can’t see my­self re­tir­ing and play­ing golf every day.</p>
    <p>Q What does money mean to you?</p>
    <p>A A by-prod­uct or out­come of your abil­ity to work hard, take cal­cu­lated risk and to a de­gree have a lit­tle luck.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now ...</p>
    <p>A A three-storey landed prop­erty in Sen­tosa.</p>
    <p>Q I drive ...</p>
    <p>A My daily car is a white Range Rover Vogue.</p>
