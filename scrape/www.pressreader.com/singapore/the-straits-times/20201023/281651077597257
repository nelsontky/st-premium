    <p>NEW YORK After mil­len­nia of care­ful slic­ing and dic­ing, it might seem as though sci­en­tists have fig­ured out hu­man anatomy.</p>
    <p>A few dozen or­gans, a cou­ple of hun­dred bones and con­nec­tive tis­sue to tie it all to­gether. But de­spite nu­mer­ous cen­turies of scru­tiny, the body is still ca­pa­ble of sur­pris­ing sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>A team of re­searchers in the Nether­lands has dis­cov­ered what may be a set of pre­vi­ously uniden­ti­fied or­gans: a pair of large sali­vary glands, lurk­ing in the nook where the nasal cav­ity meets the throat.</p>
    <p>If the find­ings are con­firmed, this hid­den well­spring of spit could mark the first iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of its kind in about three cen­turies.</p>
    <p>Any modern anatomy book will show just three pairs of ma­jor sali­vary glands: one set near the ears, an­other be­low the jaw and an­other un­der the tongue.</p>
    <p>“Now, we think there is a fourth,” said Dr Matthijs Val­star, a sur­geon and re­searcher at the Nether­lands Cancer In­sti­tute and an au­thor on the study, pub­lished last month in the jour­nal Ra­dio­ther­apy And On­col­ogy.</p>
    <p>The study was small, and ex­am­ined a lim­ited pa­tient pop­u­la­tion, said Dr Va­lerie Fitzhugh, a pathol­o­gist at Rut­gers Univer­sity who was not in­volved in the re­search. But “it seems like they may be onto some­thing”, she said. “If it’s real, it could change the way we look at dis­ease in this re­gion.”</p>
    <p>Even with­out a di­rect ther­a­peu­tic ap­pli­ca­tion, Dr Yvonne Mow­ery, a ra­di­a­tion on­col­o­gist at Duke Univer­sity, said she “was quite shocked that we are in 2020 and have a new struc­ture iden­ti­fied in the hu­man body”.</p>
    <p>Dr Val­star and his col­leagues, who usu­ally study data from peo­ple with prostate cancer, did not set out on a trea­sure hunt for uniden­ti­fied spit glands. But the struc­tures are im­por­tant to re­searchers and doc­tors who deal in on­col­ogy.</p>
    <p>Sali­vary glands col­lec­tively churn out about a quart (about 1,000ml) of spit each day, which is re­spon­si­ble for “a lot of things that make you en­joy life”, Dr Val­star said.</p>
    <p>It lu­bri­cates the mouth, mak­ing it eas­ier to speak and swal­low. It fer­ries the tasty chem­i­cals in food to the mi­cro­scopic cells that can sense them. It even comes im­bued with crude heal­ing pow­ers, wag­ing war against germs and speed­ing the clo­sure of wounds.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors take nu­mer­ous pre­cau­tions to avoid dam­ag­ing the glands when ad­min­is­ter­ing ra­di­a­tion ther­apy, which can, with a sin­gle mis­di­rected zap, per­ma­nently com­pro­mise the del­i­cate tis­sues.</p>
    <p>While pe­rus­ing a set of scans from a ma­chine that could visu­alise tis­sues i n high de­tail, the re­searchers no­ticed two un­fa­mil­iar struc­tures dead cen­tre in the head: a duo of flat, spindly glands, a cou­ple of inches (about 5cm) in length, draped dis­creetly over the tubes that connect the ears to the throat.</p>
    <p>Puz­zled by the im­ages, they dis­sected tis­sue from two ca­dav­ers and found that the glands bore sim­i­lar­i­ties to known sali­vary glands that sit be­low the tongue.</p>
    <p>The new glands were also hooked up to large drain­ing ducts – a hint that they were fun­nelling fluid from one place to an­other.</p>
    <p>It is not com­pletely clear how the glands eluded anatomists all this while. But “the lo­ca­tion is not very ac­ces­si­ble, and you need very sen­si­tive imag­ing to de­tect it”, said Dr Wouter Vo­gel, a ra­di­a­tion on­col­o­gist at the Nether­lands Cancer In­sti­tute and an au­thor on the study.</p>
    <p>The new find, Dr Vo­gel said, might help ex­plain why peo­ple who un­dergo ra­di­a­tion ther­apy for cancer of the head or neck so of­ten end up with chronic dry mouth and swal­low­ing prob­lems. Be­cause these ob­scure glands were not known to doc­tors, “no­body ever tried to spare them” from such treat­ments, Dr Vo­gel said.</p>
