    <p>From night­club to cinema, home­grown nightlife in­sti­tu­tion Zouk is rolling out its pop-up cin­e­matic ex­pe­ri­ence Zouk Cinema Club from to­mor­row. It is the lat­est pivot by the Clarke Quay venue in a pan­demic that has put a halt to reg­u­lar night­club op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Com­plete with pop­corn from Gar­rett, cham­pagne and house pour spir­its, the main room will be trans­formed into a cinema from Wed­nes­day to Saturday nights. Open from 6 to 10.30pm, there will be one screen­ing ses­sion a night show­ing two movies.</p>
    <p>Films in its open­ing month will be on the theme of For The Love Of Mu­sic, with the space dec­o­rated to mimic the cob­bled streets of Mont­martre, Paris, and the fa­mous Red Mill of the Moulin Rouge cabaret. The likes of Moulin Rouge (2001), Grease (1978) and The Great­est Show­man (2017) are in the line-up of mu­si­cal films for Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>In line with Hal­loween, how­ever, The Sixth Sense (1999) and The Night­mare Be­fore Christ­mas (1993) will be shown this week.</p>
    <p>The ca­pac­ity is capped at 50 peo­ple and 14 ta­bles a night. Ta­ble pack­ages are priced at $75++ for one to two peo­ple on Wed­nes­days, in­clud­ing a jug of house pour spir­its or the club’s sig­na­ture Long Is­land Iced Tea. For big­ger groups of three to five peo­ple, the ex­pe­ri­ence costs</p>
    <p>$175++ and comes with three jugs.</p>
    <p>From Thurs­days to Satur­days, ta­ble pack­ages are more ex­pen­sive – at $150++ (one to two peo­ple with a bot­tle of cham­pagne) and $350++ (three to five peo­ple with a bot­tle of cham­pagne and pre­mium vodka).</p>
    <p>En­try is re­stricted to those aged 18 and above. Those in­ter­ested can reg­is­ter at zouk­club.com/ cin­emaclub.</p>
    <p>On the move to trans­form the club into a cinema, Zouk Group chief ex­ec­u­tive An­drew Li said: “Zouk is a first mover in many things and we are just try­ing to think out of the box to cre­ate ex­pe­ri­ences for the au­di­ence here, in line with evolv­ing into a 360-de­gree life­style des­ti­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Zouk had rolled out Cap­i­tal Kitchen – trans­form­ing the Capi</p>
    <p>tal Lounge into a res­tau­rant serv­ing Western and Asian dishes in July. It also started daily spin classes by Ab­so­lute Cy­cle ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>As with other cinema halls, check­ing in with the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken is com­pul­sory. This means that guests will no longer be able to gain en­try by scan­ning SafeEn­try QR codes with their phone cam­eras or the SingPass mo­bile app, or bar</p>
    <p>codes on their NRICs.</p>
    <p>To com­ply with safe dis­tanc­ing and health and safety mea­sures, hand sani­tiser is avail­able on the premises, and the clean­ing crew will sani­tise shared sur­faces ev­ery 30 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The drink­ing ex­pe­ri­ence will also be dif­fer­ent. Zouk says that cov­ers will be used for ice buck­ets while lids will be used to cover glasses and cham­pagne flutes at all times. Guests are also ad­vised to stick to us­ing one glass or flute and not to share drinks.</p>
    <p>The roll-out of Zouk Cinema Club comes as the clo­sure of nightlife venues like clubs, karaoke joints and bars with­out food li­cences en­ters its eighth con­sec­u­tive month.</p>

        <p data-role="text">In line with the open&#xAD;ing theme For The Love Of Mu&#xAD;sic, mu&#xAD;si&#xAD;cal movies such as Moulin Rouge (2001) will be screened next month, with Zouk&#x2019;s main room (above) dec&#xAD;o&#xAD;rated with Parisian touches such as the fa&#xAD;mous Red Mill of the Moulin Rouge cabaret.</p>
