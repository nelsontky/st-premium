    <p>The hawker who runs the Min Nan Pork Ribs Prawn Noo­dle stall at Tiong Bahru Food Cen­tre, Mr Tan Kin Leng, used to be ashamed of the trade.</p>
    <p>As a child, he had to help his fa­ther and grand­fa­ther at the now 50-year-old stall, while his class­mates and their fam­i­lies feasted on the food he served.</p>
    <p>To­day, he is ac­tively help­ing to keep the trade alive, men­tor­ing Mr Lim Min Jie, 34, who wishes to start his own braised food stall.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, 51, said: “When I was young, I didn’t like to come down (to the stall), but my per­spec­tive changed as I grew up. It is a re­spectable way to earn a liveli­hood and it would be a waste to dis­con­tinue the ef­forts of my fa­ther and grand­fa­ther.</p>
    <p>“With ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, a lot of jobs may dis­ap­pear. But eat­ing is im­por­tant for ev­ery­one, so I think it will be quite a sta­ble job.”</p>
    <p>His grand­fa­ther used to sell prawn noo­dles out of a push­cart. There was no food cen­tre in Tiong Bahru then, he said, and hawk­ers would gather un­der makeshift tents to sell their food in the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>In the af­ter­noon, they would walk from al­ley to al­ley to look for those who wanted lunch. At night, they went to the cin­ema nearby to ca­jole movie­go­ers into splurg­ing the last of their money on sup­per.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said he did not know if his two chil­dren, aged 15 and 16, would want to take over when he re­tires. They help out dur­ing the school hol­i­days or when he is short of staff, “but def­i­nitely not dur­ing the school term”.</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mates that only about 10 per cent to 20 per cent of hawk­ers’ chil­dren end up fol­low­ing in their par­ents’ foot­steps. But among them is his trainee, Mr Lim, whose mother was also a hawker.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim, who is mar­ried with no chil­dren, en­tered the hawker trade via a cir­cuitous route. His mother died 15 years ago, and he did not learn the tricks of the trade di­rectly from her.</p>
    <p>He was work­ing in re­tail at a sport­ing goods com­pany when he was hit by a round of Covid-19 re­trench­ments in April, lead­ing him to sell braised food from his home to make up for the loss of in­come.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause my mum used to be a hawker, lor mee has al­ways been in my life. What­ever my mum didn’t sell, I would eat,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I’m now try­ing to put to­gether her recipe. If she were still around, I would have be­come a hawker a lot sooner.”</p>
    <p>As he and Mr Tan will end up sell­ing dif­fer­ent dishes, his hawker ed­u­ca­tion is more fo­cused on the busi­ness and stall man­age­ment as­pects.</p>
    <p>But Mr Lim said Mr Tan has also been able to of­fer some tweaks to his braised food recipe and pass on the con­tacts of sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>His fu­ture stall will make a lot more use of so­cial me­dia, he said of the big­gest dif­fer­ence with Mr Tan’s busi­ness.</p>
    <p>For now, he hopes Sin­ga­pore’s bid to have hawker cul­ture in­scribed on the Unesco in­tan­gi­ble her­itage list will be suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple can travel only via the In­ter­net right now, so be­ing on the Unesco list will be an­other sell­ing point that will show up on search en­gines when peo­ple try to find out more about Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They will start to no­tice that there is some­thing in­ter­est­ing go­ing on here.”</p>
