    <p>Near the English town of Ep­ping, about 30km north-east of Lon­don, an un­ex­pected scene awaits passers-by.</p>
    <p>Past a for­est and a charm­ing street mar­ket, nu­mer­ous black Lon­don taxis are parked bumper to bumper in a muddy field, sur­rounded by bee­hives and a barn for rais­ing squab pi­geons.</p>
    <p>The cabs were re­turned by their driv­ers to a rental com­pany be­cause of the col­lapse in busi­ness af­ter Bri­tain went into lock­down in March amid the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As the num­ber of taxis piled up, the com­pany ran out of room in its garage and cut a deal with a local farmer to store about 200 of the ve­hi­cles along­side his bees and pi­geons.</p>
    <p>“I call it the field of bro­ken dreams,” said Mr Steve McNa­mara, gen­eral sec­re­tary of the Li­censed Taxi Driv­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion, which rep­re­sents about half of the Bri­tish cap­i­tal’s more than 21,500 li­censed cab­bies.</p>
    <p>Barely a fifth of Lon­don’s taxis are cur­rently op­er­at­ing, Mr McNa­mara said, and the driv­ers still on the road are av­er­ag­ing just a quar­ter of their pre-pan­demic fares.</p>
    <p>The city es­ti­mates that 3,500 taxis have left the streets since June. They are stashed in carparks, ware­houses, garages and fields all around the cap­i­tal.</p>
