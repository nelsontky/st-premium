    <p>AU­GUSTA • The most mes­meris­ing mo­ment of Tiger Woods’ seis­mic 2019 Masters vic­tory fea­tured the in­tim­i­dat­ing still­ness of a silent stare.</p>
    <p>Stand­ing de­fi­antly on the 12th green with arms folded across his ch­est dur­ing the fi­nal round, the Amer­i­can glared piti­lessly at his clos­est ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Sec­onds ear­lier, he had shrewdly and con­ser­va­tively tra­versed the tiny yet treach­er­ous creek pro­tect­ing the piv­otal green, safely po­si­tion­ing his golf ball 30 feet from the hole.</p>
    <p>With an air of con­de­scen­sion, Woods walked alone up to the plateau green and, from the op­po­site side of the creek, looked down on play­ing part­ners Fran­cisco Moli­nari and Tony Finau as they dole­fully dropped new golf balls – fu­tile first steps in an un­suc­cess­ful rally.</p>
    <p>By the time the play­ers left the green, Woods was tied for the lead and on his way to a stun­ning vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Want to know if Woods, even af­ter 19 er­ratic months, can re­tain his Masters ti­tle this week? The an­swer is in his know­ing stare dur­ing the cru­cible of last year’s tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>“It was a pure Tiger power mo­ment,” Trevor Im­mel­man, the 2008 Masters cham­pion, said last month, re­call­ing the scene.</p>
    <p>“It was the per­fect ex­am­ple of how he uses his vast Masters ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“Tiger went to the green and looked back just to say, ‘I may be 43 years old, but I’m still the man around here’.”</p>
    <p>Savvier about the se­crets to suc­ceed­ing at Au­gusta Na­tional Golf</p>
    <p>Club than any other player in this year’s field, Woods has not only won the Masters five times, he has fin­ished in the top five seven other times in his 22 tour­na­ment ap­pear­ances.</p>
    <p>Even when his game is not sharp or when he com­petes af­ter a long lay-off – or both – Woods has usu­ally man­aged to con­tend at Au­gusta Na­tional.</p>
    <p>There is no bet­ter ex­am­ple than the 2010 Masters, when Woods re­turned from a five-month ex­ile ne­ces­si­tated by the scan­dal of his mar­i­tal in­fi­deli­ties.</p>
    <p>De­spite sting­ing re­bukes from fans and from the Au­gusta Na­tional chair at the time, Billy Payne, Woods stayed in the hunt un­til the fi­nal holes, fin­ish­ing tied for fourth.</p>
    <p>“I would never count Tiger Woods out at the Masters be­cause he loves and knows Au­gusta so well, and that trig­gers very pos­i­tive vibes,” said Bern­hard Langer, who has won the Masters twice and tied for eighth at the tour­na­ment in 2014, when he was 56.</p>
    <p>“It’s that kind of place, and Tiger has 25 years of mem­o­ries to draw from.”</p>
    <p>But in a sports year dif­fer­ent from any other in mod­ern times, Woods has been a far less daunt­ing pres­ence be­cause of his balky lower back, which has been sur­gi­cally re­paired four times.</p>
    <p>Play­ing in­fre­quently, he has turned in sev­eral sparkling rounds when his swing was fluid and his move­ments sup­ple.</p>
    <p>But it has been just as com­mon to see him limp­ing 24 hours later, with one hand pressed against a back warped by re­shaped bone and scarred tis­sue, toil­ing fruit­lessly in pain.</p>
    <p>In July, af­ter one such un­even per­for­mance in con­sec­u­tive rounds of the Memo­rial Tour­na­ment, Woods ex­plained the hourby-hour un­pre­dictabil­ity of his back.</p>
    <p>That morn­ing, he felt lim­ber when he woke up, but a few hours later was too stiff to take a full golf swing. “It’s go­ing to hap­pen more times than not,” he said, smil­ing.</p>
    <p>This is his new re­al­ity, which in­cludes the un­der­stand­ing that if he is go­ing to win the three more Ma­jors needed to tie Jack Nick­laus’ record to­tal of 18, or match Nick­laus’ record six Masters ti­tles, it will prob­a­bly have to hap­pen in the next few years.</p>
    <p>With the clock tick­ing this sea­son, Woods has strug­gled. In the six tour­na­ments he has en­tered since the PGA Tour re­sumed in June af­ter a three-month lay­off caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, he has not fin­ished higher than a tie for 37th.</p>
    <p>In the five Ma­jors he has played since his 2019 Masters vic­tory, he has missed the cut three times, tied for 21st and tied for 37th.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, his younger col­leagues on the PGA Tour, as well as his con­tem­po­raries in the cham­pi­ons-only Au­gusta Na­tional locker room, uni­formly con­sider him among the favourites this week and so do on­line bet­ting sites.</p>
    <p>“The whole world saw what Tiger did in the fi­nal round last year when he me­thod­i­cally chased down ev­ery name ahead of him on the leader­board,” said 36-year-old Gary Wood­land, the 2019 US Open cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“It was proof of his tal­ent but also showed the depth of his in­valu­able ex­pe­ri­ence on that golf course.”</p>
    <p>Woods will have one less chal­lenger in the field af­ter 2017 Masters cham­pion Ser­gio Gar­cia on Mon­day with­drew from the fi­nal Ma­jor of the year af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Spa­niard, who re­vealed he de­vel­oped symp­toms fol­low­ing his missed cut at last Sun­day’s Hous­ton Open, tweeted: “Af­ter 21 years of not miss­ing a Ma­jor Cham­pi­onship, I will sadly miss The Masters this week.</p>
    <p>“The im­por­tant thing is that my fam­ily and I are feel­ing good. We’ll come back stronger and give the green jacket a go next April.”</p>
