    <p>Painted in per­spi­ra­tion, their faces are like shiny por­traits in stress. It’s the fifth set of the US Open fi­nal and pres­sure clings to them, clogs their joints, stills their feet. Win­ning a first Slam is sup­posed to be hard but, god, this hard?</p>
    <p>Pres­sure is ev­i­dent in Alexan­der Zverev’s hic­cup­ing sec­ond serves, in the overly-care­ful Do­minic Thiem’s back­hand slices, in the 120 un­forced er­rors they col­lect all day.</p>
    <p>Pres­sure turns the DJ into a mean co­me­dian. In Oc­to­ber 1981, two months after Roger Fed­erer is born, Queen and David Bowie re­lease a sin­gle. It’s called Un­der Pres­sure and 39 years later it plays in Arthur Ashe Sta­dium in the fifth set. “Pres­sure push­ing down on me Press­ing down on you, no man ask for.”</p>
    <p>Man, sport is cruel.</p>
    <p>Later, Thiem, who wins the US Open 2-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (8-6), will say, “The prob­lem was my nerves. I was su­per, su­per tight”. Later, Zverev, who had led two sets to love, turns into a 1.98m tower of tears. The first Slam is a painful chase.</p>
    <p>We’re spoilt, that’s our prob­lem, we’re used to those guys, No­vak, Rafa, Roger, who can walk a tightrope in the wind while sip­ping a fine wine, who do hand-eye stuff which would make David Blaine go pale. Those three have 56 Grand Slam ti­tles to­gether, these two men are col­lec­tively on zero Slams but aware of their op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>“We both didn’t face one of the big three,” ad­mit­ted Thiem, “so I guess that was in the back of the head for both of us. That’s why we were on nerves. Was a very good chance for the both of us.”</p>
    <p>This isn’t an ad­ver­tise­ment for five-set matches and yet the fifth set is a study in re­sis­tance against anx­i­ety. It has six breaks of serve, six dou­ble faults, 26 win­ners, a few bel­lows of “Let’s go”, 3,518m of sprint­ing and yet there’s no statis­tic for ten­sion. It can’t be mea­sured, only felt, even by us.</p>
    <p>The tennis is hes­i­tant, not pretty, it’s young men strain­ing to be some­body. Con­tender to cham­pion is like leap­ing the Grand Canyon and you can see them sum­mon­ing the faith. They start the fifth by break­ing each other. It’s 1-1.</p>
    <p>The fifth set is the last lap of the 10,000m, ex­tra time in foot­ball, the search for fi­nal gears. Zverev’s sec­ond serve speed drops by 25kmh (153kmh to 128kmh) from the first set to the fifth and Thiem’s dips by 15kmh (157kmh to 142kmh). They’re tired but can’t stop and this is why we are drawn to ath­letes.</p>
    <p>Tennis has never been lone­lier. Once, talk­ing about New York fans, Boris Becker said: “Here you can do what you want. You can play a sax­o­phone in the stands and no­body cares.” But now there’s no crowd to spark a fire, no heck­ler to fuel them, no recog­ni­tion of a great shot ex­cept on the score­board.</p>
    <p>Zverev breaks Thiem to 5-3 in the fifth set. It’s a chance which will be­come a lament for he is bro­ken by Thiem and will later say: “I was su­per close to be­ing a Grand Slam cham­pion. I was a few games away, maybe a few points away.”</p>
    <p>This fi­nal will not be filed away un­der “epic” or “marathon”, it’s not some slick Nex­tGen call­ing card or some Homeric for­get-the-old-guys tale. Any­way, noth­ing or no one at this Open can match Naomi Osaka, who hits fore­hands like a swiv­el­ling right hook yet is a con­tained fig­ure who un­veils her con­vic­tion by wear­ing masks to hon­our vic­tims of racial in­jus­tice and po­lice bru­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>The masks aren’t a dis­trac­tion but an in­spi­ra­tion, for she plays for some­thing larger than her­self. She brings seven of them with her and it tells you about her quiet am­bi­tion. This is a hero­ine for the times.</p>
    <p>Osaka is the un­beat­able story of the Open but these men don’t care, they only want to beat each other. They don’t care what peo­ple might say, that Fed­erer is in­jured, Nadal never came, Djokovic tripped him­self, be­cause that’s not their con­cern. How to hold serve is.</p>
    <p>Zverev loses serve to 5-6. Thiem loses serve to 6-6.</p>
    <p>This set of 69 min­utes has mea­sured up in its own way. It is not about a mas­tery of an­gles but a re­silience of spirit. The last point will change one life mas­sively and it is a driver and also a weight.</p>
    <p>In the tie-breaker, Zverev leads 2-0. He’s led all night and it will haunt him for a while. His left quad is cramp­ing and two dou­ble faults fol­low in the tie-breaker. Thiem limps but won’t fold.</p>
    <p>The last Aus­trian to win a Slam was Thomas Muster in 1995 and when he broke his leg once he built a bench which al­lowed him to sit on it and prac­tise with his cast on. An­other Aus­trian star was fa­mous for say­ing “I’ll be back” and Thiem sim­ply won’t go away.</p>
    <p>At 27, Thiem has a first Slam. At 23, Zverev knows there is an­other this month in Paris. In this Covid time they’re not sup­posed to hug, but they do and it feels OK. They’ve been tested enough all fort­night. And through five sets by each other.</p>
    <p>The tennis is hes­i­tant, not pretty, it’s young men strain­ing to be some­body. Con­tender to cham­pion is like leap­ing the Grand Canyon and you can see them sum­mon­ing the faith.</p>
