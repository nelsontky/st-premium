    <p>Sin­ga­pore artist Ge­or­gette Chen’s The Sam Sui Worker dou­bled its pre-sale es­ti­mate price at a Bon­hams auc­tion in Hong Kong on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>It sold for HK$2.75 mil­lion (S$482,409) in the sale, which also rang up healthy sales fig­ures for other Sin­ga­porean artists.</p>
    <p>Ms Ber­nadette Rank­ine, Bon­hams’ South-east Asia di­rec­tor, told The Straits Times there were six tele­phone bids for the piece, in­clud­ing buy­ers from China.</p>
    <p>“It is a beau­ti­ful piece that re­flects who we are, telling a story of na­tional iden­tity and na­tion-build­ing. Chen’s por­traits are un­der-ap­pre­ci­ated com­pared to her still lifes; this piece is an en­dear­ing so­cial study of the sit­ter seen through the lens of a very sym­pa­thetic painter,” she added.</p>
    <p>Dr Brid­get Tracy Tan, di­rec­tor, In­sti­tute of Southeast Asian Arts/ Art Gal­leries at the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, said that Chen’s prices have “al­most cer­tainly dou­bled es­ti­mates when­ever they come into the auc­tion mar­ket”.</p>
    <p>She added this is be­cause her works rarely come up for sale. “In terms of the rar­ity and Chen’s track record at auc­tion, the cur­rent sale price is, if any­thing, a re­ally good deal.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chong Huai Seng, art col­lec­tor and co-founder of The Cul­ture Story, ob­served: “Ge­or­gette Chen has been a clear favourite of many col­lec­tors be­cause of her larg­erthan-life pro­file and her works are quite lim­ited in the mar­ket. The fact that she is prob­a­bly the only fe­male artist of note among all the other fa­mous male artists also helps.”</p>
    <p>While this work has fetched a high price, Chen’s works have sold for higher be­fore. Her record is Lo­tus Sym­phony, which sold at Sotheby’s in 2014 for US$1.18 mil­lion (S$1.6 mil­lion). The work is cur­rently in the Long Mu­seum in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>Other Sin­ga­pore artists who went un­der the ham­mer and sold for more than their pre-sale es­ti­mates in­cluded Chen Wen Hsi and Tan Choh Tee.</p>
    <p>Chen Wen Hsi’s Chicken, with a pre-sale es­ti­mate price of S$3,500 to S$5,300, sold for S$14,359 while Tan’s Evening At An Eat­ing Stall, with a pre-sale es­ti­mate of S$8,800 to S$14,000, sold for S$24,224.</p>
    <p>Ms Rank­ine said: “Both works by Chen Wen Hsi – Chicken and Bul­bul – ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tion. Tan Choh Tee’s Evening At An Eat­ing Stall comes with the orig­i­nal cat­a­logue and the re­ceipt of the sale, so the prove­nance is un­beat­able.”</p>
    <p>She noted: “The foot­print for the ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the Nanyang School is ex­pand­ing. We even had a call from Abu Dhabi ask­ing about the work by Cheong Soo Pieng, The Toy Store.”</p>
    <p>The lesser-known Sin­ga­porean artist Vin­cent Hois­ing­ton did not sell.</p>
    <p>Ms Rank­ine said: “He is an im­por­tant artist to any­one col­lect­ing works by Nanyang School artists. We are re­ceiv­ing pos­i­tive feed­back from af­ter-sales.”</p>
