    <p>• Ari­zona and Wis­con­sin have made Demo­crat Joe Bi­den’s vic­to­ries in those states of­fi­cial, deal­ing the lat­est blow to Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s cam­paign to over­turn his de­feat.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den de­feated Mr Trump by 10,457 votes in Ari­zona, ac­cord­ing to the of­fi­cial re­sults cer­ti­fied by Sec­re­tary of State Katie Hobbs in Phoenix. Mon­day’s cer­ti­fi­ca­tion con­firms that Mr Bi­den won the state and trig­gers the ap­point­ment of elec­tors who will cast Ari­zona’s 11 Elec­toral Col­lege votes for Mr Bi­den when they meet on Dec 14, un­less a court in­ter­venes.</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin elec­tions com­mis­sion chair Ann Ja­cobs also of­fi­cially con­firmed the vote’s re­sult on Mon­day, sending it to Demo­cratic Gov­er­nor Tony Evers to ap­point elec­tors for the state’s 10 elec­toral votes. Ms Ja­cobs’ ac­tion also starts a five-day pe­riod for Mr Trump to ap­peal the out­come of a re­count.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign re­quested and paid US$3 mil­lion (S$4 mil­lion) for a re­count in two heav­ily Demo­cratic coun­ties that con­firmed Mr Bi­den’s win in the state and even in­creased his more than 20,000-vote mar­gin of vic­tory over Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign at­tacked prac­tices around ab­sen­tee bal­lots when it re­quested the re­count in the two coun­ties, but elec­tion of­fi­cials in the state have re­peat­edly de­fended the in­tegrity of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ari­zona and Wis­con­sin are the last con­tested bat­tle­ground states to make their pres­i­den­tial elec­tion re­sults of­fi­cial. Penn­syl­va­nia, Michi­gan and Ne­vada cer­ti­fied Mr Bi­den’s vic­to­ries last week, and Ge­or­gia made his win there of­fi­cial on Nov 20.</p>
    <p>It is yet an­other loss in ef­forts by Mr Trump and his al­lies to over­turn his de­feat by chal­leng­ing the elec­tion re­sults in court and seek­ing to halt the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion in some states, de­spite fail­ing to pro­duce ev­i­dence. Those tac­tics have met with nu­mer­ous court de­feats.</p>
    <p>“This elec­tion was con­ducted with trans­parency, ac­cu­racy and fair­ness in ac­cor­dance with Ari­zona’s laws and elec­tions pro­ce­dures, de­spite nu­mer­ous un­founded claims to the con­trary,” Ms Hobbs said be­fore cer­ti­fy­ing the state’s re­sults.</p>
    <p>The state also cer­ti­fied the vic­tory of Demo­crat Mark Kelly over Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor Martha McSally. Mr Kelly will be sworn in to­day, ac­cord­ing to a se­nior Demo­cratic aide.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s vic­tory in Ari­zona does not qual­ify for an au­to­matic re­count be­cause the win­ning mar­gin is greater than the lesser of 200 votes or 1/10 of 1 per cent of the dif­fer­ence be­tween the two can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>There is no pro­vi­sion for a los­ing can­di­date to re­quest a re­count, ac­cord­ing to the sec­re­tary of state’s of</p>
