    <p>NEW YORK • Ja­pan’s Naomi Osaka re­versed her de­ci­sion to with­draw from the WTA Western & South­ern Open semi-fi­nals yes­ter­day, say­ing she will now play the match that has been re­ar­ranged for today.</p>
    <p>The two-time Grand Slam cham­pion had said in a state­ment on Wed­nes­day that she had pulled out of her last-four clash with Bel­gium’s Elise Mertens in protest at the po­lice shoot­ing of black man Ja­cob Blake in Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>How­ever, af­ter WTA and ATP chiefs an­nounced a sus­pen­sion of play at the tour­na­ment fol­low­ing anger over Blake’s shoot­ing, Osaka said she has now changed her mind.</p>
    <p>“As you know, I pulled out of the tour­na­ment yes­ter­day in sup­port of racial injustice and con­tin­ued po­lice vi­o­lence,” Osaka said in a state­ment first re­ported by Bri­tain’s The Guardian and The New York Times. “I was (and am) ready and pre­pared to con­cede the match to my op­po­nent.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, af­ter my an­nounce­ment and lengthy con­sul­ta­tion with the WTA and USTA, I have agreed at their re­quest to play on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“They of­fered to post­pone all matches un­til Fri­day and in my mind that brings more at­ten­tion to the move­ment.</p>
    <p>“I want to thank the WTA and the tour­na­ment for their sup­port.”</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the for­mer world No. 1, born in Ja­pan to a Haitian fa­ther and a Ja­panese mother, had tweeted: “Be­fore I am a ath­lete, I am a black woman.</p>
    <p>“And as a black woman I feel as though there are much more im­por­tant mat­ters at hand that need immediate at­ten­tion, rather than watch­ing me play ten­nis.”</p>
    <p>The semi-fi­nals will be played today, which is sched­uled to be the fi­nal day of the event. World No. 10 Osaka de­feated Anett Kon­taveit 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 to reach the last four, where she was sched­uled to face Mertens. The Bel­gian needed just over an hour to de­feat qual­i­fier Jes­sica Peg­ula 6-1, 6-3 to reach her first Premier 5 semi-fi­nal.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish No. 1 Jo­hanna Konta will face for­mer world No. 1 Vic­to­ria Azarenka in the other semi-fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“I don’t expect any­thing dras­tic to hap­pen with me not play­ing, but if I can get a con­ver­sa­tion started in a ma­jor­ity white sport, I con­sider that a step in the right di­rec­tion,” Osaka had added on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Her de­ci­sion to pull out had been hailed by the ten­nis fra­ter­nity.</p>
    <p>Fel­low semi-fi­nal­ist Mi­los Raonic, the Cana­dian who was set to play Greece’s Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas yes­ter­day at the same event in New York, sup­ported her de­ci­sion and said: “I think it’s the right next step be­cause things do need to change.”</p>
    <p>So­cial ac­tivist and ten­nis leg­end Bil­lie Jean King tweeted: “A brave & im­pact­ful move by @naomiosaka in sup­port of the protest move­ment mov­ing through the sports world... Ath­letes us­ing plat­forms for good means so much. Don’t re­main silent.”</p>
    <p>French fel­low pro Al­ize Cor­net also praised the world’s high­est­paid fe­male ath­lete, say­ing: “Deep­est re­spect @naomiosaka You are a true leader.”</p>
    <p>“As a sport, ten­nis is col­lec­tively tak­ing a stance against racial in­equal­ity and so­cial injustice that once again has been thrust to the fore­front in the United States,” or­gan­is­ers said.</p>
