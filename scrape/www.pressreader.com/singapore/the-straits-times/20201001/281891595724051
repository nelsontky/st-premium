    <p>• The US and Tai­wan will work to­gether on in­fra­struc­ture projects in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion and Latin Amer­ica, of­fi­cials have said, in an im­plicit push­back against China’s own mas­sive re­gional in­vest­ment plans.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton is deeply con­cerned about Bei­jing’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive to build roads, rail­ways and other fa­cil­i­ties to link China to Europe, Asia and be­yond, view­ing it as a plan to en­trap coun­tries in China’s or­bit with debt diplo­macy.</p>
    <p>China denies this.</p>
    <p>The project is the United States’ lat­est ef­fort to help Tai­wan break out of its di­plo­matic iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The de facto US em­bassy in Taipei, the Amer­i­can In­sti­tute in Tai­wan (AIT), said yes­ter­day that the new plan would sup­port “qual­ity in­fra­struc­ture in emerg­ing mar­kets”, while Tai­wan For­eign Min­is­ter Joseph Wu said it dove­tailed the US’ Indo-Pa­cific strat­egy with Tai­wan’s own New South­bound Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter ef­fort aims to boost eco­nomic ties with South-east and South Asia, to cut the is­land’s reliance on China, which sees Tai­wan as a rene­gade prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has ex­ten­sive busi­ness in­ter­ac­tions with South-east Asian coun­tries such as Viet­nam and Thai­land. Nine of the re­main­ing 15 coun­tries to of­fi­cially recog­nise its gov­ern­ment are in Latin Amer­ica and the Caribbean.</p>
    <p>“The Tai­wan-US co­op­er­a­tive part­ner­ship re­la­tion­ship has gone up an­other level,” Mr Wu said.</p>
    <p>There were no im­me­di­ate de­tails of the vol­ume of fund­ing or in­vest­ment projects, how­ever.</p>
    <p>The plan sets up a work­ing group led by the US Trea­sury Depart­ment and Tai­wan’s Fi­nance Min­istry to iden­tify and pro­mote pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tor col­lab­o­ra­tion in in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Brent Chris­tensen, direc­tor of AIT and the top US of­fi­cial in Tai­wan, said the pact, known as the Frame­work to Strengthen In­fra­struc­ture Fi­nance and Mar­ket Build­ing Co­op­er­a­tion, would of­fer a plat­form to pro­mote more re­silient sup­ply chains in the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>The work­ing group is due to hold its first meet­ing this au­tumn, he added.</p>
    <p>Like most coun­tries, the US has no for­mal di­plo­matic ties with Tai­wan. But it is Tai­wan’s most im­por­tant in­ter­na­tional backer and main source of arms.</p>
    <p>Last month, the US and Tai­wan said they were seek­ing “like-minded” democ­ra­cies to join a shift i n global sup­ply chains dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, as Wash­ing­ton looks to ease its eco­nomic reliance on China.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has also been keen to wean its econ­omy off China, es­pe­cially as Bei­jing steps up ef­forts at mil­i­tary in­tim­i­da­tion against the is­land.</p>
