    <p>WASH­ING­TON • An emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion re­quest for the Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioNTech was ex­pected to be filed with the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) yes­ter­day, the United States gov­ern­ment and BioNTech’s co-founder said.</p>
    <p>This type of au­tho­ri­sa­tion is tem­po­rary or con­di­tional and is granted in re­sponse to an emer­gency sit­u­a­tion, such as a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Pfizer’s part­ner BioNTech has an­nounced that to­mor­row they in­tend to file for emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion at the FDA,” Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar told a press con­fer­ence on Thurs­day in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>BioNTech co-founder Ugur Sahin had ear­lier said in a Zoom in­ter­view: “The doc­u­ments will be fi­nalised today and to­mor­row and sub­mit­ted to the FDA.”</p>
    <p>The FDA did not say how long it would take to re­view the data on vac­cine ef­fi­cacy and safety, the two main cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>The sci­en­tific head of the US op­er­a­tion to de­velop a vac­cine, Dr Mon­cef Slaoui, said on Mon­day that the green light would prob­a­bly come next month – a time frame echoed by Dr Sahin.</p>
    <p>He said that there is a chance they could re­ceive the green light from the US “this year” and even start de­liv­er­ing the vac­cine by next month.</p>
    <p>The BioNTech/Pfizer shot and an­other one be­ing de­vel­oped by US firm Moderna have taken the lead in the global chase for a vac­cine, af­ter large-scale trial data this month showed that their jabs were around 95 per cent ef­fec­tive against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The twin break­throughs have lifted hopes for an end to a pan­demic that has in­fected more than 56 mil­lion peo­ple and caused over 1.3 mil­lion deaths world­wide since the virus first emerged in China late last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Azar said at the press con­fer­ence: “We would ex­pect to see Moderna fil­ing soon also.”</p>
    <p>The US, the Euro­pean Union and a slew of other na­tions have al­ready placed orders for hun­dreds of mil­lions of doses of the top vac­cine can­di­dates in de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Health work­ers, car­ers and peo­ple con­sid­ered at high risk for se­vere Covid-19 are set to be first in line for the jabs.</p>
    <p>Both vac­cines are based on rel­a­tively new tech­nol­ogy that uses a syn­thetic ver­sion of a mol­e­cule called “mes­sen­ger RNA” to hack into hu­man cells and ef­fec­tively turn them into vac­cine-mak­ing fac­to­ries.</p>
    <p>No vac­cine based on this plat­form has ever been ap­proved.</p>
    <p>The speed at which the vac­cines have been de­vel­oped has raised alarm in some quarters.</p>
    <p>Tra­di­tional virus vac­cines use ac­tual viruses that can take months or years to de­velop.</p>
    <p>But top US in­fec­tious dis­ease of­fi­cial An­thony Fauci sought to dis­pel those con­cerns dur­ing a rare brief­ing by the White House task force on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“The... speed did not com­pro­mise at all safety, nor did it com­pro­mise sci­en­tific in­tegrity. It was a re­flec­tion of the ex­tra­or­di­nary sci­en­tific ad­vances in these types of vac­cines which al­lowed us to do things in months that ac­tu­ally took years be­fore,” Dr Fauci said.</p>
    <p>“It was ac­tu­ally an in­de­pen­dent body of peo­ple who have no al­le­giance to any­one – not to the ad­min­is­tra­tion, not to me, not to the com­pa­nies – that looked at the data and deemed it to be sound,” he added.</p>
    <p>“So we need to put to rest any con­cept that this was rushed in an in­ap­pro­pri­ate way. This is re­ally solid.”</p>
