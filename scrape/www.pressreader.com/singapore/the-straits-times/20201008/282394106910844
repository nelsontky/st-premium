    <p>Ed­die Van Halen’s mu­si­cian­ship, song­writ­ing and sense of style had a big im­pact on many lo­cal gui­tarists and fans.</p>
    <p>The song­writer and lead gui­tarist of the Amer­i­can rock band Van Halen died of can­cer at the age of 65 on Oct 6.</p>
    <p>Addy Cra­dle, who plays gui­tar for acts rang­ing from vet­eran singer Ramli Sarip to bands such as Jive Talkin’, says that Van Halen’s sig­na­ture gui­tar play­ing and sound was a big in­flu­ence on him.</p>
    <p>“Like thou­sands, maybe mil­lions of gui­tarist out there, I stud­ied his “fin­ger-tap­ping” tech­nique. Back in the day, there was no YouTube, so I learnt his tech­nique by lis­ten­ing to cas­settes and ask­ing my se­niors for tips,” says the 45-year-old.</p>
    <p>Cra­dle’s real name is Addy Ra­sidi and he has re­leased three solo al­bums. He adds: “The way he bends the notes to change its pitch up or down dras­ti­cally to cre­ate spe­cial ef­fects, that’s the iconic Van Halen sound that no one had heard be­fore he came up with it in the late 1970s.”</p>
    <p>Daniel Chai, who has played for artists and groups rang­ing from Ste­fanie Sun, Siti Nurhal­iza to The Sin­ga­pore Sym­phonic Or­ches­tra, says that Van Halen’s play­ing was more than just about speed and tech­nique.</p>
    <p>“He wrote great songs too and that’s why the band’s mu­sic was in the Top 10, Top 20 charts.” The mu­si­cian, who is in his 40s, has been col­lect­ing Van Halen al­bums since the 1980s.</p>
    <p>“He in­flu­enced the way elec­tric gui­tars are built to­day. In the 1970s, he did things with the gui­tar’s elec­tron­ics that were crazy at that time.”</p>
    <p>Si­mon Yong, who re­leased his sec­ond solo album Nasty Catawam­pus ear­lier this year , says that hear­ing Van Halen’s sig­na­ture song Erup­tion (1978) was a “life-chang­ing” ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“The track was both weird and as­tound­ing at the same time. I couldn’t be­lieve it was ac­tu­ally done on an elec­tric gui­tar,” says the gui­tarist, who also plays for lo­cal bands Zero Se­quence and Shirlyn & The UnXpected.</p>
    <p>“He was also an in­ven­tor. He com­bined art and sci­ence to cre­ate sev­eral de­vices that helped shape new sounds and styles that changed rock ’n roll for­ever.”</p>
    <p>Van Halen’s play­ing went be­yond rock mu­sic, says Rosli Man­sor, a gui­tar teacher who has re­leased two solo al­bums, Dragged (2007) and Deeper Than Pur­ple (2010).</p>
    <p>“He learnt from his idols such as jazz fu­sion gui­tarist Al­lan Holdsworth,” says the 51-year-old. “His play­ing was very raw but also in­tel­lec­tual. He cov­ered ev­ery as­pect of the mu­sic, not just the gui­tars but also the song­writ­ing and the melodies.”</p>
    <p>Gui­tarist Mo­liano Ras­madi from vet­eran rock band Love­hunters says that Van Halen’s solo on Michael Jack­son’s Beat It (1982) was an in­stant clas­sic.</p>
    <p>The 61-year-old says: “Michael Jack­son is the King of Pop and when Ed­die Van Halen added his gui­tar solo to Beat It, it be­came the most iconic gui­tar solo line of the cen­tury for me.”</p>
    <p>Rock pho­tog­ra­pher and Van Halen fan Ed­die Sung says that he is on a par with two other late iconic gui­tarists – Jimi Hen­drix and Ste­vie Ray Vaughan.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides his vir­tu­oso gui­tar play­ing, he re­ally had a great and cool fash­ion sense. As a teenager, I paid at­ten­tion to what he wore,” says the 62-year-old, whose col­lec­tion of mu­sic mem­o­ra­bilia in­cludes a back­stage pass to Van Halen’s early 1990s For Un­law­ful Car­nal Knowl­edge tour.</p>
    <p>“He ex­uded Cal­i­for­nia cool, which I loved. He wasn’t flashy in dress­ing, just enough so you know he’s the real deal.”</p>
