    <p>Covid-19 has had a great im­pact on stu­dents’ ed­u­ca­tion this year. On­line learn­ing from home be­came the norm dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and will prob­a­bly be part of the new norm.</p>
    <p>Though face-to-face lessons have re­sumed, out-of-class­room ac­tiv­i­ties are still cur­tailed.</p>
    <p>This begs the ques­tion: Are our stu­dents getting enough real-world ex­po­sure?</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­tedly, this is­sue has been around even be­fore Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Years ago, when I was teach­ing at a polytech­nic, the stu­dents seemed sur­prised when they learnt that the potato comes from a plant with leaves, flow­ers, stems and roots.</p>
    <p>They had be­lieved that those un­der­ground stems sold in the su­per­mar­ket were all there was to this com­mon food.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, in my cur­rent sci­ence tu­ition classes for up­per pri­mary pupils, I was sur­prised that they had never seen a co­conut and its tree. Iron­i­cally, the co­conut is a model an­swer for the sci­ence topic on plant re­pro­duc­tion as it dis­perses its seed by wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing up, I saw lots of co­conut trees along the coast and in parks.</p>
    <p>My par­ents never failed to point out how the fruit ended up be­ing served at hawker stalls.</p>
    <p>It was un­think­able for chil­dren not to know about the co­conut.</p>
    <p>To be fair, this is­sue is not just the re­spon­si­bil­ity of schools but also of par­ents.</p>
    <p>Learn­ing to code is well and good, but noth­ing can re­place im­mer­sion in the phys­i­cal world to learn about its won­ders.</p>
    <p>This will be chal­leng­ing in the world of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Yet it is only right that schools and par­ents make the ef­fort to in­te­grate ex­pe­ri­ences in na­ture and life into our chil­dren’s grow­ing-up years.</p>
    <p>We do not want the young gen­er­a­tion to end up be­ing com­pe­tent and com­fort­able only in the vir­tual world but help­less and ig­no­rant in the real world out­side. Kwok Chen Ko</p>
