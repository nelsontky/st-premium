    <p>• Jose Mour­inho be­lieves that play­ers are be­ing put in dan­ger by the foot­ball au­thor­i­ties af­ter Tot­ten­ham beat Chelsea 5-4 on penal­ties on Tues­day to progress to the quar­ter-fi­nals of the League Cup af­ter a 1-1 draw.</p>
    <p>Spurs were play­ing the sec­ond of four games in eight days in three dif­fer­ent com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>Eric Dier was the only out­field player re­tained from the Tot­ten­ham line-up that started Sun­day’s 1-1 draw in the Pre­mier League against New­cas­tle, and the Eng­land de­fender had to dash from the field for a toi­let break in the sec­ond-half.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of min­utes played is dan­ger­ous. What I did to­day with Eric Dier is very dan­ger­ous,” said Mour­inho, sug­gest­ing that de­hy­dra­tion could have l ed to the de­fender’s prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“It should be for­bid­den to play two matches in 48 hours. What Eric Dier did is not hu­man.”</p>
    <p>Timo Werner’s first goal for Chelsea com­pounded Mour­inho’s woes in a dom­i­nant start from Frank Lam­pard’s men.</p>
    <p>But Erik Lamela lev­elled for Spurs seven min­utes from time and new Chelsea goal­keeper Edouard Mendy was un­able to stop Dier, Lamela, Pierre-Emile Ho­jb­jerg, Lu­cas Moura and Harry Kane scor­ing from the spot.</p>
    <p>Tammy Abra­ham, Ce­sar Azpilicuet­a, Jorginho and Emer­son also con­verted their penal­ties.</p>
    <p>But Ma­son Mount’s ef­fort clipped the post to the de­light of the watch­ing Gareth Bale, who could be fit to fea­ture for Spurs in the last eight with the matches not till late De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>“Any­thing can hap­pen on penal­ties,” said Lam­pard. “You want to stay i n th­ese com­pe­ti­tions of course but there’s lots to like. We dom­i­nated the first half but the game changed (in the sec­ond).”</p>
    <p>Mour­inho claimed the fix­ture pile-up gave him no choice but to pri­ori­tise to­day’s Europa League play-off tie against Mac­cabi Haifa.</p>
    <p>“I told the play­ers they should only think about this game, but I have to think about three games,” added the Por­tuguese man­ager, who faces his for­mer club Manch­ester United in the Pre­mier League on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“I can­not be­lieve in 48 hours we are play­ing a Euro­pean game. The boys were ab­so­lutely phe­nom­e­nal.”</p>
    <p>Lam­pard made eight changes, but Werner was one of those re­tained from the 3-3 draw at West Brom on Satur­day and he took the op­por­tu­nity to get his first goal af­ter mov­ing from Bun­desliga team RB Leipzig.</p>
    <p>Spurs debu­tant Ser­gio Reguilon was twice at fault in the build-up as he gifted pos­ses­sion to Azpilicuet­a and then dived in try­ing to block the Spa­niard’s cross, which al­lowed the Chelsea cap­tain to pick out Werner at the edge of the box to ar­row a shot into the bot­tom cor­ner.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho then showed his in­tent by in­tro­duc­ing Kane with 20 min­utes to go.</p>
    <p>But mo­ments later the Spurs boss was march­ing down the tunnel af­ter Dier, as the de­fender made a dash to the dress­ing room be­fore quickly re­turn­ing.</p>
    <p>Chelsea did not make the most of a brief pe­riod with an ex­tra man, as Cal­lum Hud­son-Odoi fired over and Werner’s fierce ef­fort was saved by Hugo Lloris.</p>
    <p>“He wasn’t happy but there was noth­ing I could do about it, na­ture was call­ing,” said Dier of be­ing pur­sued by Mour­inho.</p>
    <p>“I heard there was a chance, but thank­fully they didn’t score.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea were pun­ished when Lamela slot­ted home at the far post to send the game to a shoot-out and ul­ti­mately Spurs into the last eight.</p>
    <p>THREE’S A CROWD</p>
    <p>I told the play­ers they should only think about this game, but I have to think about three games.</p>
    <p>JOSE MOUR­INHO, Spurs man­ager, whose side played Chelsea in the League Cup on Tues­day and will face Mac­cabi Haifa in the Europa League to­day and Manch­ester United in the Pre­mier League on Sun­day.</p>
