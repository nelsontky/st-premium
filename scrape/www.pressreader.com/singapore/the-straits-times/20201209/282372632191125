    <p>Four-time world cham­pion Se­bas­tian Vet­tel now has big shoes to fill next sea­son after Ser­gio Perez won Sun­day’s Sakhir Grand Prix for Rac­ing Point, For­mula One’s mo­tor­sport man­ag­ing direc­tor Ross Brawn said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man is join­ing what will be the re­branded As­ton Martin team from Fer­rari, where he has been out of sorts the past two years.</p>
    <p>The move has pushed on-form Perez, who at 30 is three years younger than Vet­tel, out of the door.</p>
    <p>While the Mex­i­can cur­rently has no seat lined up for next year, he is fourth in the driv­ers’ stand­ings after his first F1 win and ru­mours per­sist he could re­place Alexan­der Al­bon at Red Bull, as the Thai has yet to con­vince along­side team­mate Max Ver­stap­pen.</p>
    <p>Brawn, in a col­umn on the for­mula1.com web­site, re­peated his view that it will be a “tragedy” if Perez is not on the grid next year.</p>
    <p>“The team (Rac­ing Point) must be think­ing about the de­ci­sions they have made, los­ing him when he’s driv­ing so well,” said the Bri­ton. “His re­place­ment I’m sure will come back stronger, as he’s in a bit of a trough at the mo­ment, but Checo is a guar­an­teed deal.</p>
    <p>“So that’ll be in­ter­est­ing to see how that de­vel­ops. In a way, Seb has fairly big shoes to fill now, even if he’s a world cham­pion.”</p>
    <p>Vet­tel won his ti­tles with Red</p>
    <p>Bull from 2010-13 and has 53 race wins. How­ever, he only has one podium fin­ish this year – third at last month’s Turk­ish Grand Prix – while last sea­son, he had just one race win in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But Perez is not ex­pect­ing a call from Red Bull, telling Sky F1 yes­ter­day: “No, I don’t think (so), to be hon­est. My pic­ture is get­ting clearer. If I am not on the grid next year, I al­ready have op­tions to come back in 2022. So I am at peace with my­self.</p>
    <p>“I’m in a nice place. I can def­i­nitely take a year out.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff con­firmed seven-time world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton was mak­ing good progress in his re­cov­ery from Covid-19 but would need to re­turn a neg­a­tive test by to­mor­row to en­sure his par­tic­i­pa­tion in the sea­son-end­ing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sun­day.</p>
