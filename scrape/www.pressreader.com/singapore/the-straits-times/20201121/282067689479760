    <p>The Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) agree­ment which was signed on Sun­day has been rightly hailed as a boost for free trade and Asian eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion. How­ever, many of its 15 sig­na­to­ries – which com­prised the 10 mem­bers of Asean, plus China, Ja­pan, South Korea, Aus­tralia and New Zealand – would con­cur that the ab­sence from the RCEP of Asia’s third­largest econ­omy, In­dia, some­what di­lutes the scope and po­ten­tial im­pact of the agree­ment. In­dia pulled out of the RCEP in Novem­ber last year, say­ing that many of its con­cerns were not met. These in­cluded a lack of pro­tec­tion against po­ten­tial surges of im­ports; in­ad­e­quate trans­parency re­lat­ing to the use of gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies; rules of ori­gin, which are un­re­lated to value-ad­di­tion; and a weak chap­ter on ex­ports of ser­vices, in which In­dia en­joys com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages.</p>
    <p>Since pulling out of the agree­ment, In­dia has dou­bled down on its po­si­tion. At a re­cent busi­ness fo­rum, In­dia’s Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs Min­is­ter S. Jais­hankar pointed out that In­dia has mis­tak­enly “al­lowed sub­sidised prod­ucts and un­fair pro­duc­tion ad­van­tages from abroad to pre­vail”. With­out nam­ing the RCEP or any spe­cific coun­try, he added that those who cited the ben­e­fits of open­ness and ef­fi­ciency did not present the full pic­ture – which in prac­tice in­cludes non-tar­iff bar­ri­ers, sub­si­dies and state cap­i­tal­ism. Many read this as an oblique ref­er­ence to China. In­dia’s trou­bled re­la­tion­ship with China fol­low­ing re­cent bor­der clashes be­tween the two had no doubt re­in­forced its op­po­si­tion to join­ing the RCEP, which it views as a pri­mar­ily China-driven trade group­ing.</p>
    <p>Many ob­servers, in­clud­ing within In­dia, point out that the coun­try would lose out by ex­clud­ing it­self from the RCEP. It would have more dif­fi­culty join­ing re­gional sup­ply chains, be less favoured as a des­ti­na­tion for for­eign in­vest­ment, es­pe­cially from the re­gion, and would not be in­volved in set­ting the agenda for the fu­ture of the RCEP. In­dia al­ready has free trade agree­ments (FTAs) with most RCEP mem­bers, in­clud­ing Asean, Ja­pan and South Korea. It is re­view­ing some of these, as it feels they have not de­liv­ered as much as they promised. But this is partly the re­sult of In­dian ex­porters not ad­e­quately us­ing the FTAs. It is also re­lated to re­stric­tive land and labour reg­u­la­tions, which ham­per in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>In­dian of­fi­cials recog­nise the need for new re­forms to build the ca­pac­i­ties that would en­able In­dian in­dus­try to with­stand greater com­pe­ti­tion, and that is their pri­or­ity for now. As for the RCEP, they plan to wait and watch how the rat­i­fi­ca­tion process pro­gresses and how China deals with the other mem­bers dur­ing the two years be­fore the agree­ment comes into force. The RCEP’s door re­mains open to In­dia. While its ab­sence is re­gret­table, the hope is that In­dia will, in good time, come on board.</p>
