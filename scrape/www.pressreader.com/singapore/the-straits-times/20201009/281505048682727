    <p>SingPost will launch new uni­forms for more than 1,000 of its em­ploy­ees to­day to mark World Post Day.</p>
    <p>This is the first full re­design of postal uni­forms since 2011. There are six dif­fer­ent uni­form sets, and the new look fea­tures the same colours – white, red and blue.</p>
    <p>SingPost said the uni­forms were de­signed to be both prac­ti­cal and con­tem­po­rary, for its postal staff to “carry out their du­ties in com­fort”.</p>
    <p>To suit Sin­ga­pore’s hu­mid cli­mate, the new post­man uni­form is made of polyester, vis­cose and cot­ton so that it is “breath­able, com­fort­able, yet ro­bust”.</p>
    <p>It in­cludes ven­ti­la­tion flaps with in­ner mesh on the back, so that post­men re­main cool while work­ing out­doors. It also fea­tures re­flec­tive strips to make them more vis­i­ble to ve­hi­cles on the road, as well as a weather­proof jacket and pants to pro­tect them against the el­e­ments.</p>
    <p>Be­sides post­men, work­ers and su­per­vi­sors in the pro­cess­ing fa­cil­ity as well as courier arm Speed­post’s par­cel am­bas­sadors have also been is­sued new uni­forms.</p>
    <p>Tem­po­rary postal work­ers who do not wear uni­forms will re­ceive an apron.</p>
    <p>SingPost group chief brand and com­mu­ni­ca­tions of­fi­cer Robin Goh said the new uni­forms mark a new era for the com­pany.</p>
    <p>“This new look is an im­por­tant mile­stone for us as we press on with the next lap in this jour­ney, rep­re­sent­ing the bold and bright vi­sion that we want to achieve as a team. The use of strong colours is a de­lib­er­ate choice in por­tray­ing our postal team as an en­er­getic force, as we el­e­vate and equip them with new skill sets to­wards the launch of our smart let­ter­box,” he said.</p>
    <p>On Sept 12, SingPost an­nounced that it will be con­duct­ing a trial of its smart let­ter­box sys­tem in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>The trial will start with one neigh­bour­hood in the west. This sys­tem uses a cen­tral ma­chine, in­stead of in­di­vid­ual let­ter­boxes, that stores and dis­penses mail and small pack­ages. Items are sorted ac­cord­ing to size for more space ef­fi­ciency, and can be re­trieved from the ma­chine by users pro­vid­ing a form of au­then­ti­ca­tion, such as through scan­ning a QR code.</p>
    <p>Users may also re­ceive no­ti­fi­ca­tions through a mo­bile app when items ar­rive.</p>
