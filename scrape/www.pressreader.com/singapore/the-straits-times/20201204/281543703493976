    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON The United States hopes to im­mu­nise 100 mil­lion peo­ple against Covid-19 by the end of Fe­bru­ary, a top of­fi­cial has said, which is ap­prox­i­mately 40 per cent of the coun­try’s adult pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The push should start within weeks when vac­cines de­vel­oped by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna-US Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health (NIH) are ex­pected to be ap­proved.</p>
    <p>Each vaccine re­quires two doses, the sec­ond af­ter three weeks and four weeks, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>“Be­tween mid-De­cem­ber and the end of Fe­bru­ary, we will have po­ten­tially im­mu­nised 100 mil­lion peo­ple,” Dr Mon­cef Slaoui, sci­en­tific ad­viser to the US gov­ern­ment’s Oper­a­tion Warp Speed (OWS) pro­gramme, told re­porters on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>This, he added, would cover the at-risk pop­u­la­tion com­pris­ing the el­derly, health­care work­ers and first re­spon­ders.</p>
    <p>There will be an am­ple amount of vaccine to im­mu­nise three mil­lion res­i­dents of long-term care fa­cil­i­ties this month, said the former phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ex­ec­u­tive, who was re­cruited by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in spring.</p>
    <p>The rest of the first tranche would be enough to reach the bulk of health­care work­ers, if states and other ter­ri­to­ries agree with fed­eral rec­om­men­da­tions to pri­ori­tise this pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>As pro­duc­tion of the two vac­cines ex­pands, 20 mil­lion will be reached this month, 30 mil­lion next month and 50 mil­lion in Fe­bru­ary, mak­ing 100 mil­lion in to­tal.</p>
    <p>This fig­ure, how­ever, ex­cludes other vac­cines by John­son & John­son and As­traZeneca-Ox­ford which are in the late stages of de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Slaoui said both vac­cines could pro­duce their re­sults be­tween the end of this month and the mid­dle of next month, paving the way for emer­gency ap­proval by Fe­bru­ary if the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) gives the green light.</p>
    <p>Dr Slaoui added that the As­traZeneca-Ox­ford vaccine might be eval­u­ated solely on the ba­sis of a large US clin­i­cal trial in­volv­ing 15,000 peo­ple, and not with data from Bri­tain and Brazil, where the data has been marred by a dosage is­sue.</p>
    <p>While the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was ap­proved by Bri­tain on Wed­nes­day, the process is slower and more pub­lic in the US.</p>
    <p>The FDA will not grant an emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion (EUA) be­fore a pub­lic meet­ing of an ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee is held next Thurs­day. For the Moderna-NIH</p>
    <p>PROM­ISE OF QUICK DIS­TRI­BU­TION vaccine, a sim­i­lar meet­ing will take place on Dec 17.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials say the lo­gis­tics have been put in place to start dis­tribut­ing the vac­cines, if ap­proved, al­most right away.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral Gus­tave Perna, chief op­er­a­tions of­fi­cer of OWS, said: “When an EUA de­ci­sion comes, dis­tri­bu­tion to the Amer­i­can peo­ple be­comes im­me­di­ate within 24 hours, that is our goal.”</p>
    <p>Right now, he is ex­pect­ing to de­liver the first doses on Dec 15.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some US health­care work­ers are scep­ti­cal about tak­ing a vaccine that was de­vel­oped in record time – even as the pan­demic rages on.</p>
    <p>Some want more time, de­spite as­sur­ances from ex­perts that they trust the vaccine vet­ting process car­ried out by the FDA.</p>
    <p>“I think I would take the vaccine later on, but right now, I am a lit­tle leery of it,” nurse Yolanda Dod­son, 55, told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>Vaccine stud­ies so far “look promis­ing, but I don’t think there is enough data yet”, said Ms Dod­son, who works at Mon­te­fiore Hospi­tal in New York City.</p>
    <p>Ms Diana Tor­res, a nurse at a Man­hat­tan hospi­tal, is par­tic­u­larly sus­pi­cious of vac­cines rushed for ap­proval un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>She said: “This is a vaccine that was de­vel­oped in less than a year, and ap­proved un­der the same ad­min­is­tra­tion and gov­ern­ment agen­cies that al­lowed the virus to spread like a wild­fire.</p>
    <p>“This time around, I will pass and watch how it un­folds.”</p>
    <p>Data from clin­i­cal tri­als have shown that both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna-NIH vac­cines are about 95 per cent ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>When an (emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion) de­ci­sion comes, dis­tri­bu­tion to the Amer­i­can peo­ple be­comes im­me­di­ate within 24 hours, that ’’ is our goal.</p>
