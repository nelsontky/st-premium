    <p>As travel opens, the nov­elty will cer­tainly wear off. How­ever, when bun­dled with a stay­ca­tion, limo trans­fers and air­port shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ences, peo­ple will lap it up... To me, it is about the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy and pump­ing some money back into the sec­tor. MR STE­FAN WOOD, di­rec­tor at air­craft char­ter firm Sin­ga­pore Air Char­ter, on the flights to nowhere.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) is look­ing to launch no-des­ti­na­tion flights from Changi Air­port next month, in a bid to give its ail­ing business a lift.</p>
    <p>Sources told The Sun­day Times the na­tional car­rier is work­ing to­wards launch­ing this op­tion for do­mes­tic pas­sen­gers, dubbed “flights to nowhere”, by the end of next month.</p>
    <p>They said SIA also plans to ex­plore a part­ner­ship with the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board to al­low in­ter­ested pas­sen­gers to par­tially pay for such flights with tourism cred­its that will be given out by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Each flight is ex­pected to take about three hours.</p>
    <p>Air­craft char­ter firm Sin­ga­pore Air Char­ter di­rec­tor Ste­fan Wood told The Sun­day Times that he had ap­proached SIA about the pos­si­bil­ity of set­ting up a joint ven­ture to pro­vide such flights to nowhere us­ing the Air­bus A-350 planes from SIA.</p>
    <p>But he said the talks stalled re­cently, with SIA in­di­cat­ing in­ter­est in go­ing ahead with such plans on its own.</p>
    <p>When asked by The Sun­day Times about the plans to launch flights to nowhere, a spokesman said: “SIA is con­sid­er­ing sev­eral ini­tia­tives that would al­low us to con­tinue en­gag­ing both our cus­tomers and mem­bers of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“We will make an an­nounce­ment at the ap­pro­pri­ate time if we go ahead with th­ese plans.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral air­lines world­wide, in­clud­ing EVA Air in Tai­wan, have pi­loted flights to nowhere in an at­tempt to cope with the dras­tic fall in de­mand for air travel due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Like other air­lines, SIA has been bat­tered by the fall­out. The SIA Group, which also in­cludes re­gional arm SilkAir and bud­get car­rier Scoot, an­nounced on Thurs­day that it will cut around 4,300 po­si­tions, with an es­ti­mated 2,400 em­ploy­ees ex­pected to be af­fected af­ter tak­ing into ac­count pre­vi­ous mea­sures.</p>
    <p>SIA has op­er­ated a flight to nowhere be­fore, for a char­ity ini­tia­tive in 2015 when it fer­ried more than 300 ben­e­fi­cia­ries of the Com­mu­nity Chest, such as chil­dren with spe­cial needs and the dis­ad­van­taged el­derly.</p>
    <p>No de­tails are avail­able on SIA’s flights to nowhere, but Mr Wood said he had en­vi­sioned a bun­dle pack­age for such no-des­ti­na­tion flights.</p>
    <p>This would have in­cluded part­ner­ships with ho­tels to of­fer stay­ca­tions, shop­ping vouch­ers for use at Jewel Changi Air­port and a limou­sine ser­vice to ferry cus­tomers around.</p>
    <p>He is con­fi­dent that there will be de­mand for such flights in Sin­ga­pore should they even­tu­ally be launched.</p>
    <p>A survey of 308 peo­ple that his firm con­ducted found that 75 per cent are will­ing to pay for flights to nowhere.</p>
    <p>The most pop­u­lar price that re­spon­dents are will­ing to pay for an econ­omy class seat is $288, with 45 per cent of re­spon­dents say­ing they are will­ing to do so.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 40 per cent said they are will­ing to pay $588 for a business class seat.</p>
    <p>Sixty per cent of re­spon­dents said they would pre­fer the flight to last two hours.</p>
    <p>Mr Wood said of th­ese flights to nowhere: “As travel opens, the nov­elty will cer­tainly wear off. How­ever, when bun­dled with a stay­ca­tion, limo trans­fers and air­port shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ences, peo­ple will lap it up.”</p>
    <p>He added that his firm will drop plans to launch flights to nowhere on com­mer­cial planes in Sin­ga­pore if SIA suc­cess­fully in­tro­duces its of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>“To me, it is about the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy and pump­ing some money back into the sec­tor,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ngee Ann Polytech­nic se­nior lec­turer in tourism Michael Chiam noted that air­lines such as EVA Air and Ja­pan’s All Nip­pon Air­ways have had good take-up rates on their flight-to-nowhere of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple may find flights to nowhere a nov­elty and they may be will­ing to give it a try and par­tic­i­pate just for the thrill of it,” he said.</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Bren­dan So­bie of So­bie Avi­a­tion said such flights will at least break even and use air­craft and crew that would oth­er­wise have been un­used.</p>
    <p>“It cer­tainly doesn’t hurt to do th­ese flights but I wouldn’t ex­pect a big impact in terms of rev­enue or re­duced losses dur­ing th­ese chal­leng­ing times,” he said.</p>
