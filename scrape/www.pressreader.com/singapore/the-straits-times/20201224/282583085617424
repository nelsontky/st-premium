    <p>The Princess Switch, a 2018 Christ­mas rom­com, slot­ted into a very spe­cific genre: sto­ries where two strangers who hap­pen to look ex­actly alike de­cide to trade places.</p>
    <p>In the film, Vanessa Hud­gens played both dop­pel­gangers: an Amer­i­can baker named Stacey and the Euro­pean duchess she dis­cov­ers is her ex­act dou­ble, Lady Mar­garet.</p>
    <p>But the se­quel, The Princess Switch: Switched Again, takes the im­prob­a­bil­ity fac­tor even fur­ther by in­tro­duc­ing a “triple-ganger”, or third looka­like: Mar­garet’s cousin, Lady Fiona, who schemes to usurp her in her fu­ture role as queen.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to the press by Zoom, the ac­tress ad­mits it was tricky keep­ing the three char­ac­ters dis­tinct and not mix­ing them up – es­pe­cially as they all speak with dif­fer­ent ac­cents.</p>
    <p>Hud­gens, star of the High School Mu­si­cal films (2006 to 2008), says play­ing three peo­ple in a movie was “just about as crazy as you would think”.</p>
    <p>“I’m al­ways down for a chal­lenge so I was, like, ‘Let’s do this and see what hap­pens.’</p>
    <p>“It was re­ally fun, though, be­cause I got to be re­ally hands-on with the new char­ac­ter, Fiona, and just de­velop her from the ground up. They gave me com­plete free­dom to give her what­ever ac­cent I wanted and I helped build how she looks.”</p>
    <p>El­e­ments of all three came from her own personalit­y, says the 32-year-old – even with Fiona, the vil­lain of the piece.</p>
    <p>“She’s very over-the-top and ex­tremely dra­matic, and that is a bit of me as well, so it was re­ally nice to be able to bring that into the pic­ture.</p>
    <p>“I re­lied on the di­rec­tor, Mike Rohl, to reel me in if I was do­ing too much for her, but he never did, so that’s what we got,” says Hud­gens with a laugh.</p>
    <p>Stacey, the tal­ented young pas­try-shop owner from Chicago, has a dif­fer­ent life from the ac­tress, but “she’s ba­si­cally me”,</p>
    <p>says the star. “I didn’t have to put on an ac­cent to play her.”</p>
    <p>For Mar­garet, how­ever, Hud­gens stud­ied var­i­ous real-life Euro­pean roy­als “and took bits and pieces from dif­fer­ent princesses”.</p>
    <p>“And the thing I started with for her was her phys­i­cal­ity. Just be­ing some­one born into roy­alty, I feel like you carry your­self a cer­tain way and I wanted to make that dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>All this was, how­ever, ex­haust­ing. “Man, af­ter a 13-hour day of be­ing on set, do­ing switches and act­ing with dif­fer­ent ver­sions of my­self, my brain was just very fraz­zled,” says the ac­tress, who also ap­peared in the dark crime com­edy Spring Break­ers (2012).</p>
    <p>Asked if there is any­one she would swop places with in real life, she says: “I feel like if I could, it would be some­one with ex­treme power so that I could do ev­ery­thing I could to try to help the world.</p>
    <p>“But other than that, I’m very happy and grate­ful for my life. I love what I do and love the peo­ple in my life, and I don’t re­ally want to switch with any­body.”</p>
    <p>Hud­gens also took on a fourth</p>
    <p>role as an ex­ec­u­tive pro­ducer on the film. “And it was re­ally great. As an ac­tor on a project, you al­ways have a point of view and sug­ges­tions, but you don’t want to over­step any bound­aries.</p>
    <p>“But be­ing a pro­ducer, I wasn’t over­step­ping and I got to be re­ally in­volved with the scripts, in de­vel­op­ing all the char­ac­ters as well as the wardrobe, hair and make-up, and mak­ing sure this was the best it could be.”</p>
    <p>And she feels she has paid her dues and earned this greater level of re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been in the in­dus­try since I was nine years old, so I’ve been at this for over two decades and it’s a hus­tle.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “When you be­lieve in some­thing, it’s about not tak­ing no for an an­swer and con­tin­u­ing to fight for what you be­lieve in and what you know you can do.</p>
    <p>“And if you’re not given the op­por­tu­nity, mak­ing the op­por­tu­nity for your­self and con­tin­u­ing to hus­tle. It’s all about the hus­tle.”</p>
