    <p>The Malaysian gov­ern­ment is zoom­ing in on im­prov­ing con­di­tions in for­eign worker lodg­ings and con­duct­ing health checks for nearly 900,000 work­ers, as coro­n­avirus cases surged among em­ploy­ees of Top Glove, the world’s big­gest maker of gloves, in Se­lan­gor’s Klang dis­trict.</p>
    <p>A pro­duc­tion worker at Top Glove, the world’s big­gest maker of rub­ber gloves, lamented that con­di­tions in his Malaysian lodg­ing pro­vided by the com­pany are ter­ri­ble.</p>
    <p>“Each room has about eight to 12 work­ers, and we share one bath­room,” the young mi­grant worker told The Straits Times, on con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>“I am not com­fort­able with the ac­com­mo­da­tion as there are so many work­ers in one room, and it gets dirty,” he said. At times, wa­ter is not avail­able to clean the bath­rooms, he said.</p>
    <p>As the Malaysian au­thor­i­ties grap­ple with try­ing to re­duce the num­ber of Covid-19 cases in the coun­try, for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries have emerged as hot­beds of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Daily av­er­age cases in Malaysia have mostly re­mained above 1,000 a day since last month, and hit a record 2,188 just last week.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts say that the con­gested and un­san­i­tary dor­mi­to­ries are breed­ing grounds for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The Top Glove-linked coro­n­avirus clus­ter, called the Ter­atai clus­ter af­ter the street where many of the com­pany’s fac­to­ries and dorms are lo­cated, has recorded at least 5,083 pos­i­tive cases out of</p>
    <p>6,609 peo­ple screened by Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Worse, labour ac­tivists say the Top Glove dorms in the Klang dis­trict in Se­lan­gor are the tip of the ice­berg for poor con­di­tions in for­eign worker hous­ing in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant to note the is­sues be­ing ex­posed through the Top Glove case study of abuse are sys­temic is­sues across the whole of</p>
    <p>the Malaysian gloves sec­tor, and in­deed most mi­grant labour-in­ten­sive sec­tors of the Malaysian econ­omy,” said mi­grant worker rights ac­tivist Andy Hall.</p>
    <p>“The con­di­tions in Top Glove are far from the worst, they are ac­tu­ally bet­ter than most even,” Mr Hall told The Straits Times. He shared pho­tos show­ing hos­tels at other glove man­u­fac­tur­ers, de­scrib­ing them as “ap­palling” and “ter­ri­ble”.</p>
    <p>Top Glove hires 21,000 em­ploy­ees in its plants in four coun­tries, with 11,000 of them mi­grant work­ers in its Malaysian fac­to­ries. They mostly come from South Asian coun­tries such as In­dia, Bangladesh and Nepal, earn­ing a ba­sic salary start­ing from around RM1,200 (S$394) a month.</p>
    <p>Top Glove’s dorms in Klang and its sur­round­ing ar­eas are un­der a strict lock­down, called the en­hanced move­ment con­trol or­der, with barbed wire fenc­ing around the com­pound.</p>
    <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day logged 1,141 new daily cases to raise the to­tal to 70,236. There were no new fa­tal­i­ties, with the death toll re­main­ing at 376.</p>
    <p>Nearly 890,000 for­eign work­ers will be re­quired to un­dergo Covid-19 screen­ing, which has started, Se­nior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob said on Tues­day. The gov­ern­ment is dis­tribut­ing 100,000 anti­gen rapid test kits to clin­ics and hos­pi­tals in sev­eral states in the first phase of the screen­ings.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has some two mil­lion for­eign­ers who work legally in the coun­try. There are an ad­di­tional two mil­lion un­doc­u­mented mi­grants, ac­cord­ing to es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment said on Tues­day that it would take le­gal ac­tion against Top Glove af­ter find­ing that it did not com­ply with stan­dards for worker ac­com­mo­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Top Glove said it has spent RM20 mil­lion in the past two months to im­prove worker ac­com­mo­da­tion, and is look­ing to ex­pand its dorms.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers say more time is needed to com­ply with gov­ern­ment re­quire­ments, such as hous­ing only six work­ers per 1,500 sq ft.</p>
    <p>“The con­di­tion of work­ers’ hous­ing may not be as good as it should be. But em­ploy­ers need time,” Malaysian Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Sham­sud­din Bar­dan told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Even to meet the re­quire­ments at the end of next year would be a chal­lenge due to the eco­nomic slow­down.”</p>
    <p>The deputy of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin in Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia has lost his ma­jor­ity test in the Perak state assem­bly, bring­ing an end to his two-year ten­ure as Perak men­teri be­sar.</p>
    <p>The vote yes­ter­day also ex­posed the rift be­tween Ber­satu and its Perikatan Na­sional (PN) ally Umno in the north­ern Malaysian state.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Ah­mad Faizal Azumu gar­nered sup­port of only 10 out of 59 state as­sem­bly­men dur­ing the Perak state assem­bly sit­ting. He is deputy pres­i­dent of Ber­satu, whose pres­i­dent is Tan Sri Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>The vote fol­lowed a con­fi­dence mo­tion filed by a law­maker from Umno, Ber­satu’s ally in both the state and fed­eral ad­min­is­tra­tions.</p>
    <p>In a se­cret bal­lot, 48 state as­sem­bly­men voted against him, with one spoilt vote. All 24 Perak op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers from Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) voted against him, along with 24 other as­sem­bly­men who are Ber­satu’s al­lies in the state.</p>
    <p>The con­fi­dence test in Perak reignited calls for a con­fi­dence test</p>
    <p>on PM Muhyid­din in the fed­eral Par­lia­ment, where PN leads with a wafer-thin ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Nu­mer­ous con­fi­dence and no­con­fi­dence mo­tions have been sub­mit­ted to test Mr Muhyid­din’s ma­jor­ity since he be­came prime min­is­ter nine months ago, but none of the mo­tions had been read or de­bated.</p>
    <p>The Perak con­fi­dence mo­tion against the chief min­is­ter was filed by as­sem­bly­man Aznel Ibrahim, who is from Umno, ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>Datuk Aznel was ap­pointed as Mr Ah­mad Faizal’s po­lit­i­cal sec­re­tary last month without con­sul­ta­tion with Perak Umno – one of the moves that re­port­edly caused fur­ther un­hap­pi­ness among Umno ranks with the lat­ter’s lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Perak op­po­si­tion leader Ab­dul Aziz Bari had pre­vi­ously noted that Umno and Ber­satu are “at war” in the state.</p>
    <p>Right af­ter the vote was rat­i­fied by the state assem­bly, Mr Ah­mad Faizal in­di­cated that he would re­sign as Perak state chief and en­sure “a smooth tran­si­tion to the new gov­ern­ment”. He told the state assem­bly: “It is a great hon­our to serve the beloved state. In these chal­leng­ing times for our econ­omy, I do not want to pro­long a po­lit­i­cal cri­sis.”</p>
    <p>He later added that he be­lieved there will be no change in the state gov­ern­ment, only a change in the seat of the state chief ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>Umno sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ah­mad Maslan said later the con­fi­dence vote would only re­sult in the change of the men­teri be­sar’s post and not those of the other state ex­ec­u­tive coun­cil­lors who make up the state Cab­i­net. His state­ment came af­ter Datuk Seri Takiyud­din Has­san, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia – an ally of both Umno and Ber­satu – said his party would not take part in any bid to form a new gov­ern­ment in Perak.</p>
    <p>Mr Ah­mad Faizal orig­i­nally be­came the men­teri be­sar as part of the PH ad­min­is­tra­tion af­ter PH won the elec­tions in Perak in 2018. He quit the post ear­lier this year, but was reap­pointed af­ter PN formed a new state gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Umno has 25 seats in Perak. PN’s two other com­po­nents, Ber­satu and PAS, have five and three seats, re­spec­tively. There are an­other two leg­is­la­tors who back the PN ad­min­is­tra­tion – bring­ing the bloc’s num­ber to 35 as­sem­bly­men.</p>
    <p>A new men­teri be­sar would need the sup­port of at least 30 as­sem­bly­men.</p>
