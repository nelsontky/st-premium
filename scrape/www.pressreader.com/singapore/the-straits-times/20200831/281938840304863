    <p>For three decades, I have been doc­u­ment­ing the lives of the Ju/’hoansi peo­ple of the north-western Kala­hari, and their of­ten trau­matic en­counter with moder­nity.</p>
    <p>The Ju/’hoansi are per­haps the best known of the handful of so­ci­eties who still sus­tained them­selves by hunt­ing and gath­er­ing well into the 20th cen­tury. And to them, very lit­tle about the re­lent­lessly ex­pand­ing global econ­omy makes sense.</p>
    <p>Why, they asked me, did govern­ment of­fi­cials who sat in air-con­di­tioned of­fices drinking cof­fee and chat­ting all day long get paid so much more than the young men they sent out to dig ditches?</p>
    <p>Why, when peo­ple were paid for their work, did they still go back the fol­low­ing day rather than en­joy the fruits of their labour? And why did peo­ple work so hard to ac­quire more wealth than they could ever pos­si­bly need or en­joy?</p>
    <p>It was hardly a sur­prise that the Ju/’hoansi asked these ques­tions. By the time I started work­ing with them, it was al­ready widely ac­cepted that they were the best mod­ern ex­em­plars of how all of our hunt­ing and gath­er­ing an­ces­tors must have lived.</p>
    <p>But the longer I stayed with them, the more I be­came con­vinced that un­der­stand­ing their eco­nomic ap­proach not only of­fered in­sights into the past – it also pro­vided clues as to how we in the in­dus­tri­alised world might or­gan­ise our­selves in an in­creas­ingly au­to­mated fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Sel­dom have these lessons seemed more ur­gent. As job­less num­bers surge as a re­sult of Covid-19’s spread, prac­tices once seen as fringe are ac­cepted as an al­most in­evitable part of the new world or­der.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments are talk­ing up their will­ing­ness to em­brace rev­o­lu­tion­ary eco­nomic vac­cines, from state-spon­sored fur­lough schemes to giv­ing us cash to eat in restau­rants – any­thing to get peo­ple back to work.</p>
    <p>The same spirit in­fused pre-pan­demic de­bates about the fu­ture of work, which fo­cused mainly on con­cerns aris­ing out of the re­lent­less can­ni­bal­i­sa­tion of the em­ploy­ment mar­ket by ever more pro­duc­tive au­to­mated sys­tems and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>WHAT IS WORK FOR?</p>
    <p>It is easy to see why this gen­er­ates such anx­i­ety. The work we do also de­fines who we are; it de­ter­mines our fu­ture prospects, dic­tates where and with whom we spend most of our time and moulds our val­ues.</p>
    <p>So much so that we sing the praises of strivers and de­cry the lazi­ness of shirk­ers, while the goal of uni­ver­sal em­ploy­ment re­mains a mantra for politi­cians of all stripes.</p>
    <p>But it wasn’t meant to be like this. Ever since the first stir­rings of the In­dus­trial Rev­o­lu­tion, peo­ple have been tan­ta­lised by the prospect of a fu­ture in which au­to­ma­tion pro­gres­sively lib­er­ates or­di­nary folk from dreary work.</p>
    <p>In 1776, the found­ing fa­ther of mod­ern eco­nomics, Adam Smith, sang the praises of the “very pretty ma­chines” that he be­lieved would in time “fa­cil­i­tate and abridge labour”; in the 20th cen­tury, Ber­trand Russell de­scribed how, in a soon-to-be au­to­mated world, “or­di­nary men and women, hav­ing the op­por­tu­nity of a happy life, will be­come more kindly and less per­se­cut­ing” and even lose their “taste for war”.</p>
    <p>Russell was hope­ful that this change would hap­pen in his life­time.</p>
    <p>“The war showed con­clu­sively that, by the sci­en­tific or­gan­i­sa­tion of pro­duc­tion,” he ob­served in 1932, “it is pos­si­ble to keep mod­ern pop­u­la­tions in fair com­fort on a small part of the work­ing ca­pac­ity of the mod­ern world.”</p>
    <p>And from the turn of the</p>
    <p>20th cen­tury to the on­set of</p>
    <p>World War II, weekly work­ing hours in in­dus­trial coun­tries did in­deed re­duce steadily.</p>
    <p>The econ­o­mist John May­nard Keynes, Russell’s con­tem­po­rary, was of a sim­i­lar mind. He pre­dicted that by 2030, cap­i­tal ac­cu­mu­la­tion, im­prove­ments in pro­duc­tiv­ity and tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances would have solved the “eco­nomic prob­lem” and ush­ered in an age in which no one be­sides a few “pur­po­sive mon­ey­mak­ers” worked more than 15 hours in a week.</p>
    <p>He also took the view that the metal­lic hum of au­to­mated pro­duc­tion lines was the death knell of ortho­dox eco­nomics. The in­sti­tu­tions and struc­tures that or­gan­ise our for­mal economies are pred­i­cated squarely on the as­sump­tion of scarcity: that al­though peo­ple’s de­sires are lim­it­less, the re­sources avail­able to sat­isfy their needs and wants are not.</p>
    <p>In the au­to­mated fu­ture, he be­lieved, ab­so­lute scarcity would be a thing of the past, and as a re­sult, we would cheer­fully dis­card our by-then ob­so­lete eco­nomic in­fra­struc­ture and work­ing cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Hind­sight tells us they were wrong. We passed the thresh­olds Keynes ar­gued would need to be met to achieve a “golden age of leisure” decades ago. Yet most of us now work longer hours than Keynes’ and Russell’s con­tem­po­raries did.</p>
    <p>And as au­to­ma­tion and Covid-19 cor­rode the em­ploy­ment mar­ket, we re­main fix­ated on find­ing new work for peo­ple to do – even if that work of­ten seems to have no point other than to keep the wheels of com­merce turn­ing and push­ing growth back into the black.</p>
    <p>Yet, be­yond the ur­gency of our cur­rent predica­ment, there are good rea­sons not to aban­don these thinkers’ vi­sions of a leisured fu­ture.</p>
    <p>For tak­ing a far longer view of hu­man his­tory than that typ­i­cally taken by econ­o­mists re­veals not only that many of our ideas about work and scarcity have their roots planted firmly in the soils of the Agri­cul­tural Rev­o­lu­tion, but also that for more than 95 per cent of Homo sapi­ens’ his­tory, peo­ple en­joyed more leisure than we do now.</p>
    <p>BORN TO WORK</p>
    <p>In a very fun­da­men­tal way, we are born to work. All liv­ing or­gan­isms seek, cap­ture and ex­pend en­ergy on growing, stay­ing alive and re­pro­duc­ing.</p>
    <p>Do­ing this el­e­men­tal work is one of the things that dis­tin­guishes liv­ing or­gan­isms such as bac­te­ria, trees and peo­ple from dead things, like rocks and stars. But even among liv­ing or­gan­isms, hu­mans are con­spic­u­ous for the work they do.</p>
    <p>Most or­gan­isms are “pur­po­sive” when they ex­pend en­ergy, mean­ing that while it is pos­si­ble for an ex­ter­nal ob­server to de­ter­mine a pur­pose to their actions, there is lit­tle rea­son to be­lieve that they set about their work with a clear vi­sion of what they want to achieve in their minds.</p>
    <p>Hu­mans, by con­trast, are uniquely pur­pose­ful. When we go to work, we usu­ally do so for more rea­sons than just to cap­ture en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Plot­ting our species’ evo­lu­tion­ary tra­jec­tory re­veals that over thou­sands of gen­er­a­tions, our bod­ies and minds have been shaped pro­gres­sively by dif­fer­ent kinds of work our var­i­ous evo­lu­tion­ary an­ces­tors did.</p>
    <p>It also shows that nat­u­ral se­lec­tion moulded us into mas­ter gen­er­al­ists, supremely adapted to ac­quir­ing an as­ton­ish­ing range of skills dur­ing our life­times.</p>
    <p>Chart­ing our evo­lu­tion­ary his­tory also sug­gests that for most of his­tory, the more pur­pose­ful and ac­com­plished at se­cur­ing en­ergy our evo­lu­tion­ary an­ces­tors be­came – by virtue of the sim­ple tools they made and even­tu­ally, per­haps half a mil­lion years ago, by their mas­tery of fire – the less time and en­ergy they spent on the food quest.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they spent time on other pur­pose­ful ac­tiv­i­ties such as mak­ing mu­sic, ex­plor­ing, dec­o­rat­ing their bod­ies and so­cial­is­ing.</p>
    <p>In­deed, it is pos­si­ble that our an­ces­tors would never have de­vel­oped lan­guage were it not for the free time won by fire and tools be­cause, like our cousins the go­ril­las, they would have had to spend up to 11 hours a day la­bo­ri­ously for­ag­ing, chew­ing and pro­cess­ing fi­brous, hard-to-digest foods.</p>
    <p>New ge­nomic and ar­chae­o­log­i­cal data now sug­gests that Homo sapi­ens first emerged in Africa about 300,000 years ago. But it is a chal­lenge to in­fer how they lived from this data alone.</p>
    <p>To re­an­i­mate the frag­mented bones and bro­ken stones that are the only ev­i­dence of how our an­ces­tors lived, be­gin­ning in the 1960s, an­thro­pol­o­gists be­gan to work with rem­nant pop­u­la­tions of an­cient for­ag­ing peo­ples: the clos­est liv­ing ana­logues to how our an­ces­tors lived dur­ing the first 290,000 years of Homo sapi­ens’ his­tory.</p>
    <p>HOW HUNTER-GATH­ER­ERS LIVED</p>
    <p>The most fa­mous of these stud­ies dealt with the Ju/’hoansi, a so­ci­ety de­scended from a con­tin­u­ous line of hunter-gath­er­ers who have been liv­ing largely iso­lated in south­ern Africa since the dawn of our species.</p>
    <p>And it turned es­tab­lished ideas of so­cial evo­lu­tion on their head by show­ing that our hunter-gath­erer an­ces­tors al­most cer­tainly did not en­dure “nasty, brutish and short” lives.</p>
    <p>The Ju/’hoansi were re­vealed to be well fed, con­tent and longer-lived than peo­ple in many agri­cul­tural so­ci­eties, and by rarely hav­ing to work more than 15 hours per week had plenty of time and en­ergy to de­vote to leisure.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quent re­search pro­duced a pic­ture of how dif­fer­ently Ju/’hoansi and other small-scale forager so­ci­eties or­gan­ised them­selves eco­nom­i­cally.</p>
    <p>It re­vealed, for in­stance, the ex­tent to which their econ­omy sus­tained so­ci­eties that were at once highly in­di­vid­u­al­is­tic and fiercely egal­i­tar­ian, and in which the prin­ci­pal re­dis­tribu­tive mech­a­nism was “de­mand shar­ing” – a sys­tem that gave ev­ery­one the ab­so­lute right to ef­fec­tively tax any­one else of any sur­pluses they had.</p>
    <p>It also showed how, in these so­ci­eties, in­di­vid­ual at­tempts to ei­ther ac­cu­mu­late or mo­nop­o­lise re­sources or power were met with de­ri­sion and ridicule.</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tantly, though, it raised star­tling ques­tions about how we or­gan­ise our own economies, not least be­cause it showed that, con­trary to the as­sump­tions about hu­man na­ture that un­der­write our eco­nomic in­sti­tu­tions, for­agers were nei­ther peren­ni­ally pre­oc­cu­pied with scarcity nor en­gaged in a per­pet­ual com­pe­ti­tion for re­sources.</p>
    <p>AGRI­CUL­TURAL ROOTS OF SISYPHEAN STRUG­GLE</p>
    <p>For while the prob­lem of scarcity as­sumes that we are doomed to live in a Sisyphean pur­ga­tory, al­ways work­ing to bridge the gap be­tween our in­sa­tiable de­sires and our limited means, for­agers worked so lit­tle be­cause they had few wants, which they could al­most al­ways eas­ily sat­isfy.</p>
    <p>Rather than be­ing pre­oc­cu­pied with scarcity, they had faith in the prov­i­dence of their desert en­vi­ron­ment and in their abil­ity to ex­ploit this.</p>
    <p>If we mea­sure the suc­cess of a civil­i­sa­tion by its en­durance over time, then the Ju/’hoansi – and other south­ern African for­agers – are ex­po­nents of the most suc­cess­ful and sus­tain­able econ­omy in all of hu­man his­tory. By a huge mar­gin.</p>
    <p>These days, Ju/’hoansi do not have much cause to cel­e­brate this. Largely dis­pos­sessed of their lands over the past five decades, most scrape a liv­ing in shanties on the fringes of Namib­ian towns and in “re­set­tle­ment ar­eas” where they do bat­tle with hunger and poverty-re­lated dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Un­able to se­cure jobs in a cap­i­tal-in­ten­sive econ­omy where youth un­em­ploy­ment hov­ers just below 50 per cent, they de­pend on beg­ging, ca­sual labour – of­ten in re­turn for maize por­ridge or al­co­hol – and govern­ment aid.</p>
    <p>If our pre­oc­cu­pa­tion with scarcity and hard work is not part of hu­man na­ture but a cul­tural arte­fact, then where did it orig­i­nate?</p>
    <p>There is now good em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence to show that our em­brace of agri­cul­ture, be­gin­ning a lit­tle over 10,000 years ago, was the gen­i­tor of not just our be­lief in the virtues of hard work but, along­side it, the ba­sic as­sump­tions about hu­man na­ture that un­der­write the prob­lem of scarcity and, in turn, the in­sti­tu­tions, struc­tures and norms that shape our eco­nomic – and so­cial – lives to­day.</p>
    <p>It is no co­in­ci­dence that our con­cepts of growth, in­ter­est and debt as well as much of our eco­nomic vo­cab­u­lary – in­clud­ing words such as “fee”, “cap­i­tal” and “pe­cu­niary” – have their roots in the soils of the first great agri­cul­tural civil­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Farm­ing was much more pro­duc­tive than for­ag­ing, but it placed an un­prece­dented premium on hu­man labour.</p>
    <p>Rapidly growing agri­cul­tural pop­u­la­tions tended to al­ways re­vert quickly to the max­i­mum car­ry­ing ca­pac­ity of their land and so con­stantly lived a drought, blight, flood or in­fes­ta­tion away from famine and dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>And no mat­ter how favourable the el­e­ments, farm­ers were sub­ject to an un­re­lent­ing an­nual cy­cle that en­sured that most of the ef­forts only ever yielded re­wards in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>More than this, as any farmer will tell you, the fates will pun­ish those who put off an ur­gent job like mend­ing a fence or sow­ing a field in a timely fash­ion and re­ward those who go the ex­tra mile to make con­tin­gen­cies for the un­ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Were Russell still alive to­day, he would prob­a­bly be happy to learn that there is good ev­i­dence that our at­ti­tudes to work are a cul­tural byprod­uct of the mis­eries en­dured in early agri­cul­tural so­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>Such a recog­ni­tion would not only make his utopia em­i­nently more re­al­is­able, but also give teeth to the view that au­to­ma­tion would spell the end to scarcity and the demise of ortho­dox eco­nomics – along with the so­cial in­sti­tu­tions, struc­tures and norms that co­a­lesced around it.</p>
    <p>But he might equally be dis­cour­aged about our in­tran­si­gence over chang­ing our be­hav­iour, even when con­fronted with the costs as­so­ci­ated with end­less growth.</p>
    <p>REA­SONS FOR RE­VIEW­ING WORK CUL­TURE</p>
    <p>Yet there are many good rea­sons to re­visit our work­ing cul­ture, not the least of which be­ing that for most peo­ple, work brings few re­wards be­yond a payslip.</p>
    <p>As the poll­ster Gallup showed in its mo­men­tous sur­vey of work­ing life in 155 coun­tries pub­lished in 2017, only one in 10 western Euro­peans de­scribed them­selves as en­gaged by their jobs.</p>
    <p>This is per­haps un­sur­pris­ing. Af­ter all, in an­other sur­vey con­ducted by YouGov in 2015, 37 per cent of work­ing Bri­tish adults said their jobs were not mak­ing any mean­ing­ful con­tri­bu­tion to the world.</p>
    <p>Even putting these facts aside, there is a far more ur­gent rea­son to trans­form our ap­proach to work.</p>
    <p>Bear­ing in mind that at its most fun­da­men­tal, work is an en­ergy trans­ac­tion, and that there is an ab­so­lute cor­re­spon­dence be­tween how much work we col­lec­tively do and our en­ergy foot­print, there are good grounds to ar­gue that work­ing less – and con­sum­ing less – will not just be good for our souls but may also be es­sen­tial to en­sur­ing the sus­tain­abil­ity of our habi­tat.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic trauma in­duced by the pan­demic has pro­vided us with an op­por­tu­nity to reimag­ine our re­la­tion­ship with work and to re-eval­u­ate what jobs we con­sider re­ally im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>Few now would be will­ing to stick their necks out to ar­gue in favour of an econ­omy that in­cen­tivises our best and bright­est to as­pire to be de­riv­a­tives traders rather than epi­demi­ol­o­gists or nurses, and once-fringe ideas such as the pro­vi­sion of uni­ver­sal ba­sic in­come or the for­mal­i­sa­tion of a four-day week have flour­ished.</p>
    <p>And more than all this, the pan­demic has also re­minded us that when it comes to how we work, we are far more adapt­able than we of­ten re­alise.</p>

        <p data-role="text">In the early 20th cen&#xAD;tury, econ&#xAD;o&#xAD;mist John May&#xAD;nard Keynes pre&#xAD;dicted that by 2030, cap&#xAD;i&#xAD;tal ac&#xAD;cu&#xAD;mu&#xAD;la&#xAD;tion, im&#xAD;prove&#xAD;ments in pro&#xAD;duc&#xAD;tiv&#xAD;ity and tech&#xAD;no&#xAD;log&#xAD;i&#xAD;cal ad&#xAD;vances would have ush&#xAD;ered in an age in which no one be&#xAD;sides a few &#x201C;pur&#xAD;po&#xAD;sive mon&#xAD;ey&#xAD;mak&#xAD;ers&#x201D; worked more than 15 hours in a week.
