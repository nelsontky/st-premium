    <p>Sin­ga­porean ac­tor Mark Lee is in the run­ning for a Golden Horse Award.</p>
    <p>The 51-year-old fun­ny­man, a pro­lific host and ac­tor in both Sin­ga­porean films and tele­vi­sion with works like Money No Enough (1998), got a nod for Best Lead­ing Ac­tor for his per­for­mance as a drag queen in the fam­ily film Num­ber 1.</p>
    <p>Nom­i­na­tions for the 57th edi­tion of the pres­ti­gious film award, likened to Chi­nese-lan­guage cin­ema’s Academy Awards, were an­nounced on Wed­nes­day in a livestream­ed cer­e­mony. The awards cer­e­mony will be held in Taipei on Nov 21.</p>
    <p>Num­ber 1, a film by lo­cal di­rec­tor</p>
    <p>Ong Kuo Sin, has yet to open in cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>A sur­prised Lee says of the nom­i­na­tion in an In­sta­gram story up­loaded on Wed­nes­day evening: “Thanks ev­ery­one, I’ve not fully re­turned to my senses yet. I’m al­ready very happy to be nom­i­nated. Thank you to the judges of the Golden Horse Awards for recog­nis­ing my work.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to prior re­ports in Chi­nese daily Lianhe Zaobao, Lee plays a re­trenched gen­eral man­ager of a multi­na­tional com­pany who finds his tal­ent in drag per­for­mance and turns to it to make a liv­ing and sup­port his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>He will be com­pet­ing against Tai­wanese ac­tor Liu Kuan-ting in My Miss­ing Valen­tine, a film nom­i­nated for 11 awards this year, and other ac­tors like Austin Lin in I WeirDo, Mo Tzu-yi in Dear Ten­ant and Lam Ka-tung in Hand Rolled Ci­garette.</p>
    <p>A Tai­wan-Sin­ga­pore movie was also nom­i­nated in this year’s awards.</p>
    <p>Pre­cious Is The Night – a thriller set in 1960s Sin­ga­pore star­ring model-pho­tog­ra­pher Chuando Tan and Sin­ga­porean ac­tors like Tay Ping Hui and lo­cal vet­eran Xiang Yun and her daugh­ter Chen Yixin – re­ceived two nom­i­na­tions.</p>
    <p>The film is di­rected by Wayne Peng, a Tai­wanese doc­u­men­tary and mu­sic video maker, and pro­duced by Sin­ga­porean Lim Sau Hoong.</p>
    <p>The hus­band-and-wife team had ear­lier gained at­ten­tion when their doc­u­men­tary, Burn­ing Dreams (2003), about a dance troupe in China, was nom­i­nated for three Golden Horse Awards.</p>
    <p>Peng re­ceived a nod for cine­matog­ra­phy while Lim was nom­i­nated for best make-up and cos­tume de­sign.</p>
    <p>The film is slated to open later this year in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore films have been re­ceiv­ing more at­ten­tion at the Golden Horse Awards in re­cent years. An­thony Chen’s fam­ily drama Ilo Ilo took Best Film, Best New Di­rec­tor, Best Orig­i­nal Screen­play and Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress for Yeo Yann Yann in 2013.</p>
    <p>Last year, Yeo won Best Lead­ing Ac­tress for her per­for­mance in Chen’s for­bid­den ro­mance film Wet Sea­son.</p>
    <p>Yeo Siew Hua’s A Land Imag­ined nabbed Best Orig­i­nal Film Score and Best Orig­i­nal Screen­play.</p>
