    <p>In­ter­nal re­views by the po­lice and the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) have found lapses in how they han­dled the case of for­mer do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani, but also con­firmed that there was no im­proper in­flu­ence at any point, Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam told Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>That a maid ac­cused of theft by her prom­i­nent em­ployer, for­mer Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong, was found guilty by a lower court but later ac­quit­ted on ap­peal in the High Court, shows that all are equal be­fore the law here, the min­is­ter added.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ing a min­is­te­rial state­ment that stretched for more than two hours, Mr Shan­mugam told the House there was no sign that Mr Liew or any­one from his fam­ily had lob­bied or ex­erted pres­sure on the po­lice, deputy public prosecutor­s or trial judge over the case.</p>
    <p>In fact, the de­ci­sions on the case were taken by the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer and his im­me­di­ate su­per­vi­sor, and it was the deputy public prosecutor­s and their di­rec­tors in the AGC who de­cided to pros­e­cute Ms Parti – the typ­i­cal way such theft cases are han­dled.</p>
    <p>There were good rea­sons for these de­ci­sions too, since Ms Parti her­self had ad­mit­ted to tak­ing 10 to 15 items of cloth­ing with­out per­mis­sion and had also changed her ex­pla­na­tions for some of the items from one state­ment to another, Mr Shan­mugam told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Chan Seng Onn’s ac­quit­tal of Ms Parti on Sept 4 had sparked ques­tions about whether a pow­er­ful man had worked the sys­tem to his ad­van­tage, whether the po­lice and AGC had un­fairly prose</p>
    <p>cuted Ms Parti, whether she got a fair trial and whether there was one law for the wealthy and another for oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing these ques­tions yes­ter­day, Mr Shan­mugam said: “I can be cat­e­gor­i­cal. There was no in­flu­ence by Liew Mun Leong. It was treated as any other theft case and han­dled ac­cord­ingly.”</p>
    <p>“If Liew Mun Leong did un­fairly in­flu­ence the pro­ceed­ings, then it will be a hit to our foun­da­tions. It will hit to our sense of fair­ness, equal­ity, jus­tice and (be) a dent to Project Sin­ga­pore it­self, be­cause Sin­ga­pore is built on these ideals.”</p>
    <p>There must be a ruth­less in­ten­sity in up­hold­ing in­tegrity, he said.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party chair­man Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) and Progress Sin­ga­pore Party Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai ac­cepted that Mr Liew did not ex­ert in­flu­ence in the case, but sug­gested that more could be done to en­sure that the scales of jus­tice are not tipped against the less pow­er­ful.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim and Ms He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) moved a mo­tion for de­bate on is­sues raised by the case, ask­ing that “the House af­firms that fair­ness, ac­cess and in­de­pen­dence are cor­ner­stones of Sin­ga­pore’s jus­tice sys­tem, and calls on the Gov­ern­ment to recog­nise and rem­edy its short­com­ings in or­der to en­hance jus­tice for all, re­gard­less of means or so­cial sta­tus, in­clud­ing fa­cil­i­tat­ing a re­view of the jus­tice sys­tem”.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim and six of her party col­leagues called on the Gov­ern­ment to take a two-pronged ap­proach to ad­dress what they saw as short­com­ings in the sys­tem. She sug­gested the ex­ec­u­tive branch can tackle the “low-hang­ing fruit” like en­hanc­ing the crim­i­nal le­gal aid scheme, but said a Con­sti­tu­tional Com­mis­sion should be set up to re­view more “com­plex mat­ters” such as the sep­a­ra­tion of the At­tor­ney­Gen­eral’s pow­ers as public pros­e­cu­tor and gov­ern­ment lawyer.</p>
    <p>Mid­way through the de­bate, Mr Mu­rali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) sug­gested four amend­ments to the mo­tion, which was changed to read: “That this House recog­nises that fair­ness, ac­cess and in­de­pen­dence are cor­ner­stones of Sin­ga­pore’s jus­tice sys­tem, and af­firms the Gov­ern­ment’s con­tin­u­ous ef­forts since in­de­pen­dence to build a fair and just so­ci­ety and rem­edy any short­com­ing in or­der to en­hance jus­tice for all, re­gard­less of race, lan­guage, re­li­gion, eco­nomic means, or so­cial sta­tus.”</p>
    <p>Ex­press­ing dis­ap­point­ment at this, Ms Lim said it im­plied the Gov­ern­ment “does not even ac­cept that there are any short­com­ings... and that there would be no re­view”.</p>
    <p>In the end, all 10 WP MPs and two Progress Sin­ga­pore Party</p>
    <p>NCMPs voted against the amended mo­tion in a show of op­po­si­tion unity.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the marathon ses­sion that ended close to mid­night, the House dis­cussed is­sues thrown up by Ms Parti’s case, go­ing through the High Court judge’s re­marks as well as sug­gest­ing ways to im­prove ac­cess to jus­tice for the poorer and less ed­u­cated, and to pro­tect the in­de­pen­dence of the dif­fer­ent parts of the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam stressed that the point of his state­ment was not to re­open Ms Parti’s case, and de­clined to com­ment on her con­duct when asked by Mr Xie Yao Quan (Jurong GRC). “She has been ac­quit­ted by the High Court. And I said that we must pro­ceed on that ba­sis and not re­open that is­sue. I think we leave it at that and I don’t want to be com­ment­ing on the de­ci­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>He noted the High Court’s find­ing that Mr Liew’s son Karl was dis­hon­est, and yes­ter­day, the po­lice said the younger Mr Liew will be charged with per­jury to­day for giv­ing false in­for­ma­tion to a public ser­vant and giv­ing false ev­i­dence in court.</p>
    <p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion of­fi­cer in­volved in the case and his su­per­vis­ing of­fi­cer will also be dis­ci­plined for lapses in at­tend­ing to ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>MPs agreed with Mr Shan­mugam on the over­all sound­ness of the sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to their points, Mr Shan­mugam thanked Ms Lim and Ms He for recognisin­g that the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem, taken in to­tal­ity, works well.</p>
    <p>“They’re not say­ing the sys­tem is bro­ken, or in­ef­fec­tive,” he said. “We are on the same page, in many ways we are push­ing at an open door.”</p>
