    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Mr Joe Bi­den has made no se­cret of the speed with which he plans to bury “Amer­ica First” as a guid­ing prin­ci­ple of the na­tion’s for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect said he will re-en­ter the Iran nu­clear deal, as­sum­ing the Ira­ni­ans are will­ing to re­verse course and ob­serve its lim­its. He would also sign up for an­other five years of the only sur­viv­ing nu­clear arms treaty with Rus­sia and dou­ble down on US com­mit­ments to Nato af­ter four years of threats from Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump to with­draw from the de­fence al­liance, which guided the</p>
    <p>West through the Cold War.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Mr Bi­den said he would make Rus­sia “pay a price” for what he said have been dis­rup­tions and at­tempts to in­flu­ence elec­tions – in­clud­ing his own.</p>
    <p>The most vivid ex­am­ple, of­fi­cials said, will come in re­think­ing the China strat­egy.</p>
    <p>But mostly, Mr Bi­den said in a state­ment to The New York Times, he wants to bring an end to a slo­gan that came to de­fine a US that built walls and made work­ing with al­lies an af­ter­thought – and, in Mr Bi­den’s view, un­der­mined any chance of forg­ing a com­mon in­ter­na­tional ap­proach to fight­ing a pan­demic that has cost more than 1.2 mil­lion lives.</p>
    <p>But it is far eas­ier to prom­ise to re­turn to the largely in­ter­na­tion­al­ist ap­proach of the post-World War II era than it is to ex­e­cute that shift af­ter four years of global with­drawal and dur­ing a pan­demic that has re­in­forced na­tion­al­ist in­stincts.</p>
    <p>In in­ter­views in the past sev­eral weeks, Mr Bi­den’s top ad­vis­ers be­gan to out­line a restora­tion that might be called the Great Un­do­ing, an ef­fort to re­verse course on Mr Trump’s ag­gres­sive at­tempt to with­draw to US borders.</p>
    <p>“Whether we like it or not, the world sim­ply does not or­gan­ise it­self,” said Mr Antony Blinken, Mr Bi­den’s long-time na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser. “Un­til the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, in Demo­cratic and Repub­li­can ad­min­is­tra­tions, the US did a lot of that or­gan­is­ing, and we made some mis­takes along the way, for sure.”</p>
    <p>He added that now, how­ever, the US has dis­cov­ered what hap­pens “when some other coun­try tries to take our place or, maybe even worse, no one does, and you end up with a vac­uum that is filled by bad events”.</p>
