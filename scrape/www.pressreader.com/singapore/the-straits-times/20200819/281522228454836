    <p>More than 120 job seek­ers turned up at a job fair or­gan­ised by NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i) and held at Bukit Pan­jang Com­mu­nity Cen­tre yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 464 jobs were on of­fer, in­clud­ing open­ings for clean­ers, de­liv­ery rid­ers, software engi­neers and re­tail as­sis­tants.</p>
    <p>A new com­mu­nity ini­tia­tive for Bukit Pan­jang res­i­dents was also launched yes­ter­day at the job fair.</p>
    <p>The Bukit Pan­jang Town Jobs and Skills Sup­port Task­force will sup­ple­ment na­tional ef­forts to help job seek­ers by pro­vid­ing them with ca­reer guid­ance, fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance and coun­selling.</p>
    <p>Job seek­ers liv­ing in Bukit Pan­jang can now turn to a new grass­roots ini­tia­tive for help and sup­port.</p>
    <p>Launched yes­ter­day, the Bukit Pan­jang Town Jobs and Skills Sup­port Task­force will sup­ple­ment na­tional ef­forts to help job seek­ers, through com­mu­nity ini­tia­tives such as fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance and coun­selling.</p>
    <p>It will con­tact res­i­dents liv­ing in the Bukit Pan­jang, Zhenghua and Cashew ar­eas fort­nightly to see if they have found a job or need fur­ther as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Bukit Pan­jang MP Liang Eng Hwa noted that Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG) re­cently opened a job and skills cen­tre at Bukit Pan­jang Com­mu­nity Club (CC) to of­fer ca­reer guid­ance ser­vices. “The idea is to har­ness and aug­ment what Work­force Sin­ga­pore has set up here in Bukit Pan­jang CC,” he said.</p>
    <p>“From our in­ter­ac­tions with res­i­dents, we also know that there will al­ways be other things that they need help with. For ex­am­ple, we want to of­fer wel­fare sup­port to those who have lost their jobs and are in fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties.”</p>
    <p>Mr Liang was vis­it­ing a job fair held by the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i) at the com­mu­nity club yes­ter­day. He was there with Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC MPs Ed­ward Chia and Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan, who is For­eign Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>There were 464 jobs avail­able at the fair, in­clud­ing open­ings for re­tail as­sis­tants, restau­rant man­agers, software engi­neers and even farm op­er­a­tors. The fair drew 232 signups, with 126 turn­ing up yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The launch of the ini­tia­tive comes a day after Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat an­nounced that a fur­ther $8 bil­lion would be pumped into var­i­ous gov­ern­ment schemes to save jobs and cre­ate new ones.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Chan­dra Mo­han Reth­nam, who is lead­ing the ini­tia­tive, will work with agencies like e2i and WSG to match jobs to res­i­dents, and with grass­roots vol­un­teers to iden­tify res­i­dents in need of fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan­dra, who is also a mem­ber of the North West Com­mu­nity Devel­op­ment Coun­cil, said his role is to “draw to­gether the dif­fer­ent ef­forts from ca­reer guid­ance to fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance and coun­selling to help res­i­dents in a holis­tic way”.</p>
    <p>“There are so many pro­grammes and so much in­for­ma­tion out there for the job seeker that of­ten peo­ple don’t know what to do,” he added.</p>
    <p>“So it’s good to meet (job seek­ers) face to face and en­gage them at a one-to-one level.”</p>
