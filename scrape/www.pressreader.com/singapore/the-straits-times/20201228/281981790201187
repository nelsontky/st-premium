    <p>On Wed­nes­day evening, I hap­pened to chance upon a scene de­pict­ing a sui­cide on Chan­nel 8’s Recipe Of Life while I was hav­ing din­ner with my fam­ily.</p>
    <p>This scene, as well as the sub­se­quent scene where the father of the de­ceased blamed the pro­tag­o­nist for the death of his daugh­ter, is rather con­cern­ing for at least two rea­sons.</p>
    <p>First, it de­picted the means and scene of the sui­cide, which in­cluded the de­ceased ly­ing down on the ground.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, there is a poignant dis­play of trau­matic re­ac­tions from both the pro­tag­o­nist and the father of the de­ceased.</p>
    <p>Cine­mat­i­cally, the di­rec­tor of the show may want to show a re­al­is­tic por­trayal of per­sons suf­fer­ing from men­tal health con­di­tions and the im­pact on their loved ones. Nev­er­the­less, I am con­cerned about the way it was de­picted on na­tional tele­vi­sion, es­pe­cially dur­ing prime time.</p>
    <p>The scene may lead to “sui­cide con­ta­gion”, es­pe­cially among those who are sus­cep­ti­ble to sui­ci­dal be­hav­iour, al­beit un­wit­tingly. The pop­u­lar Net­flix series 13 Rea­sons Why has drawn flak for its graphic de­pic­tions of sui­ci­dal be­hav­iour. Re­search has shown that such scenes in the me­dia can con­trib­ute to the in­creased preva­lence of sui­cide among vul­ner­a­ble groups and in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>Also, the two Recipe Of Life scenes may re-trau­ma­tise in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies who have ei­ther at­tempted sui­cide or lost their loved ones to sui­cide.</p>
    <p>For the sake of those who have been gravely trau­ma­tised by sui­cide, I hope that the me­dia will be more sen­si­tive and take ex­tra care when de­pict­ing such scenes in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The me­dia may choose to re­fer to the resources pro­vided by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion as a guide, es­pe­cially when the theme of sui­cide is in­volved.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, the me­dia may con­sider con­sult­ing pro­fes­sion­als in the field of men­tal health for ad­vice be­fore film­ing such scenes. It is my hope that there can be a healthy bal­ance be­tween art and the safety of view­ers. Reuben Yue Woon Fah</p>
