    <p>LON­DON • David de Gea’s place in Manchester United’s line-up used to be undis­puted, win­ning four club Player of the Year awards from 2014 to 2018 and earn­ing the tag of “best goal­keeper in the world”.</p>
    <p>But in the past 18 months, mis­takes have crept into the Spa­niard’s game, to the point where they can no longer be brushed off as anom­alies.</p>
    <p>Af­ter an­other er­ror-strewn dis­play in Manchester United’s FA Cup semi-fi­nal 3-1 de­feat by Chelsea on Sun­day, Red Devils man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer told re­porters he could no longer guar­an­tee de Gea would be one of the first names on his teamsheet.</p>
    <p>Chelsea will face Arse­nal in the fi­nal on Aug 1, in large part due to a pair of em­bar­rass­ing howlers from the 29-year-old at Wem­b­ley. He was at fault when Olivier Giroud’s shot trick­led over the line in firsthalf added time.</p>
    <p>De Gea made an even worse blun­der mo­ments af­ter the in­ter­val when he failed to save what was a rou­tine at­tempt by Ma­son Mount.</p>
    <p>De­spite Bruno Fer­nan­des’ late penalty, United suf­fered their first loss in 20 games in all com­pe­ti­tions, lead­ing Sol­sk­jaer to hint he might pro­mote back-up goalie Ser­gio Romero for their home Premier League game with West Ham to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>“He knows he should save that 100 times out of 100 but that’s foot­ball for you,” the United man­ager said of Mount’s tame strike.</p>
    <p>“I can’t speak for David de Gea’s con­fi­dence but he is men­tally very strong. I made the de­ci­sion to play him and he was ready for it.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, ev­ery­one has to per­form. Ev­ery­one has a chance every time we per­form to stake a claim in the team. David knows that he should have saved the sec­ond goal, but that’s done now and we have to look for­ward to Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard for a ’keeper to make amends. David showed his char­ac­ter in the rest of the game with a few good saves.”</p>
    <p>Since the start of last sea­son, de Gea has made seven er­rors lead­ing di­rectly to an op­po­si­tion goal – only New­cas­tle No. 1 Martin Dubrakva (eight) has been worse between the sticks in the Premier League.</p>
    <p>Since the restart, he has also con­ceded soft goals against Tot­ten­ham and Bournemout­h, and many pun­dits be­lieve his de­cline has be­come too ap­par­ent for Sol­sk­jaer to ig­nore.</p>
    <p>For­mer New­cas­tle strik­ing great Alan Shearer told the BBC: “If the goal­keeper makes one mis­take, or pos­si­bly two, you think you should stick with him. But it keeps hap­pen­ing.”</p>
    <p>While for­mer United de­fender Phil Neville sought to de­fend de Gea, he also ad­mit­ted it was wor­ry­ing to see how far the Spa­niard had fallen, say­ing: “He’s un­recog­nis­able from the goal­keeper that won player of the year four years out of five years.</p>
    <p>“He’s mak­ing mis­takes. A con­fi­dent, as­sured, on-form de Gea saves all three (goals). If I was Sol­sk­jaer, then I would be wor­ried be­cause of his per­for­mance lev­els.</p>
    <p>“They’ve dipped and his in­con­sis­tency is cost­ing United games. I wouldn’t leave him out yet. His cre­den­tials are still up there with the best in the world. He’s just lost all his con­fi­dence.”</p>
    <p>With just two more league games left be­fore the Europa League re­sumes next month, United can only turn to Romero should de Gea be taken out of the fir­ing line for the rest of the term.</p>
    <p>But Sol­sk­jaer must soon de­cide whether to let Dean Hen­der­son go on loan again or utilise the 23-yearold as United’s No. 1 next sea­son.</p>
    <p>The academy grad­u­ate has been one of the key rea­sons why pro­moted Sh­effield United are chal­leng­ing for a Europa League spot, hav­ing made 13 clean sheets in the league, com­pared to 12 for de Gea.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, though, Hen­der­son has made just one mis­take lead­ing to an op­po­si­tion league goal, and that alone has con­vinced Shearer that it would be United’s folly not to re­call him.</p>
    <p>On the for­mer Eng­land Un­der-21 stop­per, who has been on loan at Bra­mall Lane for the last two years, he said: “You only bring Dean Hen­der­son back to Manchester United as the No. 1, or you keep him where he is to keep gain­ing ex­pe­ri­ence. I think that time has come.”</p>
    <p>While United fret over the lack of a safe pair of hands, Chelsea are look­ing for­ward to their 14th FA Cup fi­nal.</p>
    <p>This will be their third time fac­ing Arse­nal in the show­piece game and hav­ing lost in 2002 and 2017, the Blues are aim­ing to get the bet­ter of their cross-town ri­vals this time.</p>
    <p>“To win a semi is a great thing, but to win a fi­nal is the thing,” Chelsea man­ager Frank Lam­pard said. “We don’t want to get too far ahead of our­selves, but we can cer­tainly en­joy the per­for­mance and the re­sult.</p>
    <p>“It is ob­vi­ously right up there be­cause of the size of the game and qual­ity of the op­po­nent.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Manchester United stop&#xAD;per David de Gea al&#xAD;low&#xAD;ing Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud&#x2019;s deft near-post flick to drib&#xAD;ble over the line in first-half added time dur&#xAD;ing their FA Cup semi-fi&#xAD;nal at Wem&#xAD;b&#xAD;ley. The Spa&#xAD;niard, re&#xAD;port&#xAD;edly the high&#xAD;est-paid goal&#xAD;keeper in the world with a weekly salary of &#xA3;375,000 (S$658,000), was also at fault for the Blues&#x2019; sec&#xAD;ond goal.</p>
