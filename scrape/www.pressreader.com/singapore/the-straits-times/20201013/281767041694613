    <p>How does CPF help me with re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>The Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) sys­tem helps to give you peace of mind in re­tire­ment by tak­ing care of two needs: life­long monthly pay­outs for ba­sic needs and sav­ings for emer­gency needs. The money that you con­trib­ute to your CPF ac­count dur­ing your work­ing years goes into build­ing this nest egg for re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>How does CPF pro­vide life­long pay­outs? This is done through CPF Life, a na­tional longevity in­sur­ance an­nu­ity scheme that pro­vides monthly pay­outs through­out re­tire­ment to en­sure you do not run out of sav­ings or in­come in your sil­ver years. A CPF mem­ber can join CPF Life from age 65.</p>
    <p>How much can I with­draw from my CPF ac­count dur­ing re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>When you turn 55, the amount that you can with­draw in a lump sum is, in gen­eral, the higher of the fol­low­ing: a) $5,000; b) Or­di­nary, Spe­cial and Re­tire­ment Ac­count (OSRA)</p>
    <p>sav­ings above your co­hort’s Full Re­tire­ment Sum; or c) OSR A sav­ings above your co­hort’s Ba­sic Re­tire­ment Sum if you own a prop­erty with a re­main­ing lease that can last you till age 95</p>
    <p>CPF mem­bers are split into dif­fer­ent co­horts based on the year they turn 55.</p>
    <p>Should I with­draw the max­i­mum amount that I can the mo­ment I turn 55?</p>
    <p>It de­pends on whether you have an im­me­di­ate need for the money with­drawn. Stud­ies have shown that there have been CPF mem­bers who with­drew their lump sum at age 55 only to de­posit it in the bank, which earns much lower in­ter­est. Such mem­bers will be worse off.</p>
    <p>Leav­ing money in your CPF ac­count al­lows you to en­joy up to 6 per cent in­ter­est per an­num. All CPF mem­bers still have the right to with­draw their CPF sav­ings at any time af­ter age 55, whether in a lump sum or par­tially, as fre­quently as they like and at any time as long as they meet the ap­pli­ca­ble with­drawal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>You can with­draw your CPF sav­ings by sub­mit­ting an on­line ap­pli­ca­tion with your SingPass on the CPF web­site and re­ceive the pay­ment via PayNow or Giro. To re­ceive the pay­ment via PayNow, you just need to reg­is­ter for PayNow and link your bank ac­count to your NRIC num­ber via your bank’s ex­ist­ing In­ter­net bank­ing plat­form or mo­bile bank­ing ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Why can’t I with­draw all my sav­ings at 55?</p>
    <p>CPF Board wants to help make sure that later gen­er­a­tions have enough sav­ings to sup­port their re­tire­ment, hous­ing and health­care needs in their sil­ver years. Stud­ies have shown that what most re­tirees need is a stream of monthly pay­outs to see them through to the end of their lives.</p>
    <p>Set­ting aside your re­tire­ment sum helps to en­sure that you re­ceive a monthly in­come in re­tire­ment. The higher the re­tire­ment sum you set aside, the more monthly pay­outs you get in re­tire­ment. What’s more, with CPF Life, your pay­outs will be life­long.</p>
    <p>Why do the re­tire­ment sums keep in­creas­ing?</p>
    <p>Back in the 90s, a cup of kopi and toast cost about $1.50 at a cof­fee shop. Nowa­days, they may cost $3. These are ev­ery­day ex­am­ples of in­fla­tion, where the gen­eral rise in price level means that we can buy less with the money we have.</p>
    <p>That, cou­pled with ris­ing stan­dards of liv­ing and longer life ex­pectancy, means it will cost more for future gen­er­a­tions to en­joy their golden years.</p>
    <p>Ad­just­ing the re­tire­ment sums helps en­sure that your monthly pay­outs are enough to sup­port your liv­ing ex­penses in re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>If the Full Re­tire­ment Sum (FRS) had re­mained un­changed from $30,000 when it was first in­tro­duced in 1987, it would only pro­vide a monthly pay­out of about $300 to­day and pay­outs will cease once the Re­tire­ment Ac­count is de­pleted.</p>
    <p>Com­pare this to the FRS of $181,000 to­day, which will pro­vide a monthly pay­out of about $1,440 for life from the cur­rent Pay­out El­i­gi­bil­ity Age of 65.</p>
