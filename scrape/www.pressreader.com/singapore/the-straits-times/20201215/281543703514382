    <p>United States elec­tors met in states across the coun­try yesterday to cast their votes for the na­tion’s leader, with re­sults ex­pected to­day and Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den set to win.</p>
    <p>In­cum­bent Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in­sists the elec­tion was stolen – and most of his base be­lieves him. An over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity of Trump sup­port­ers polled say they do not see Mr Bi­den as the le­git­i­mate victor.</p>
    <p>Elec­tors met in dif­fer­ent states yesterday to cast their votes for pres­i­dent and vice-pres­i­dent, with re­sults ex­pected early this morn­ing that would ce­ment Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s vic­tory.</p>
    <p>In nor­mal times, the vote would be a day of reck­on­ing for the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, a de­fin­i­tive dec­la­ra­tion of who won and who lost. The next step – Congress’ count­ing and the an­nounce­ment of the re­sult on Jan 6 – is a mere for­mal­ity.</p>
    <p>But th­ese are not nor­mal times. Mr Bi­den leads Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump by 306 to 232 elec­toral votes. But the in­cum­bent in­sists the elec­tion was stolen – and most of his base be­lieves him.</p>
    <p>Up to 82 per cent of Trump sup­port­ers polled by CBS News do not see Mr Bi­den as the le­git­i­mate victor. A Fox News poll found that 77 per cent be­lieve the elec­tion was stolen from Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a pro-Trump rally in the cap­i­tal Wash­ing­ton last Satur­day, street bat­tles be­tween right-wing su­prem­a­cists, and leftists and Black Lives Mat­ter ac­tivists left four peo­ple with stab wounds. Vi­o­lence also oc­curred at protests out­side the Wash­ing­ton state Capi­tol in Olympia.</p>
    <p>Asked last Satur­day if the contest is over, Mr Trump said, “No, it’s not over”, and in­sisted that Mr Bi­den will be an “il­le­git­i­mate pres­i­dent”.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Mr Trump tweeted:</p>
    <p>“Swing States that have found mas­sive VOTER FRAUD, which is all of them, CAN­NOT LE­GALLY CER­TIFY th­ese votes as com­plete & cor­rect with­out com­mit­ting a se­verely pun­ish­able crime.”</p>
    <p>On Fox News Sun­day, Louisiana Repub­li­can con­gress­man Steve Scalise said: “Let the le­gal process play out... if you want to re­store trust by mil­lions of peo­ple who are still very frus­trated and an­gry about what hap­pened, that’s why you got to have this whole sys­tem play out.”</p>
    <p>Some Trump al­lies, led by Alabama Repub­li­can con­gress­man Mo Brooks, are mulling over a chal­lenge to the elec­tion re­sult on Jan 6, when Congress in a joint ses­sion con­venes to of­fi­cially tally the elec­toral votes and cer­tify Mr Bi­den as pres­i­dent-elect.</p>
    <p>Mr Brooks told The New York Times: “We have a su­pe­rior role un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion than the Supreme Court does, than any fed­eral court judge does, than any state court judge does. What we say, goes. That’s the fi­nal ver­dict.”</p>
    <p>It is a long shot, an­a­lysts say – and it still won’t change the out­come.</p>
    <p>Mr Brooks will need one sen­a­tor to join him. If he gets that, the Chamber will have to de­bate the is­sue for two hours – and for the re­sults in key states to be over­turned, both Cham­bers would have to agree.</p>
    <p>Such chal­lenges have oc­curred be­fore – most re­cently in 2017, by Democrats – but es­sen­tially in protest, with the party’s can­di­date al­ready hav­ing suc­ceeded, though con­ced­ing is not re­quired by law. In 2017, the chal­lenge was re­jected; Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton had con­ceded and no sen­a­tor joined the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Con­sti­tu­tional law pro­fes­sor Ed­ward B. Fo­ley from Ohio State Univer­sity told The New York Times: “The Jan 6 meet­ing is go­ing to con­firm that re­gard­less of how many ob­jec­tions get filed and who signs on, they are not go­ing to af­fect the out­come of the process.</p>
    <p>“We can say that with clear con­fi­dence.”</p>
    <p>At the pro-Trump rally out­side the Supreme Court last Satur­day, speak­ers laid out what they called ev­i­dence – none of which has so far stood up in any court – of mas­sive elec­toral fraud.</p>
    <p>And there was a strong re­li­gious el­e­ment. Min­nesota en­tre­pre­neur Mike Lin­dell, a vo­cal Trump sup­porter, told the crowd “Don­ald Trump was picked by God”.</p>
    <p>In an ar­ti­cle in the con­ser­va­tive Western Journal, for­mer Trump na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to ly­ing to the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion about his con­tact with Rus­sian diplo­mats (and was par­doned by Pres­i­dent Trump), wrote: “The bat­tle we are en­gaged in... re­quires the in­ter­ven­tion of God be­cause in a war against the forces of evil, only the Lord can ob­tain the vic­tory.” Mr Flynn also spoke at Satur­day’s protest.</p>
    <p>Ms Jen O’Mal­ley Dil­lon, Mr Bi­den’s deputy chief of staff, told the As­so­ci­ated Press: “(Mon­day) ob­vi­ously is a big day as it takes on a lit­tle bit more im­port than maybe tra­di­tion­ally it does.”</p>
    <p>An elec­tor can desert the can­di­date he is pledged to vote for and vote for the other, but such “faith­less elec­tors” are very rare and usu­ally only just a very few.</p>
    <p>Mr Alan Der­showitz, a lawyer and con­sti­tu­tional law scholar who taught for years at Har­vard Law School and has emerged as a staunch Trump sup­porter, told</p>
    <p>The Hill web­site that the court re­ver­sals showed the Repub­li­cans could not count on the ju­di­ciary to over­turn the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“So I sus­pect on Mon­day, we will see the elec­tors... elect Joe Bi­den,” he said. “Whether you like that or you don’t like it, that’s the re­al­ity that the Trump team has to face.”</p>
