    <p>Com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager Ger­maine Pereira, 31, paid more than $200 for a Sam­sung Galaxy Ac­tive2 smart­watch last month, which she uses to track her gym work­outs.</p>
    <p>It re­placed her cheaper fit­ness tracker from a dif­fer­ent brand, which she bought in 2016 for around $100. “I did not like it as it was not in­tu­itive and lacked smart­watch fea­tures,” she says.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple like her are fu­elling the growth of the smart­watch mar­ket.</p>
    <p>De­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, the global smart­watch mar­ket posted 20 per cent rev­enue growth in the first half of this year, ac­cord­ing to tech­nol­ogy re­search firm Coun­ter­point Re­search. It reg­is­tered year-on-year growth of 26 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket re­search com­pany IDC fore­casts that the sales rev­enue of smart­watches in Sin­ga­pore will reach US$227 mil­lion (S$308 mil­lion) this year, up from US$181 mil­lion last year. It is ex­pected to hit US$272 mil­lion next year.</p>
    <p>Ms Su­jeong Lim, a se­nior an­a­lyst at Coun­ter­point Re­search, says: “Smart­watches are evolv­ing into de­vices that in­de­pen­dently per­form health­care and fit­ness track­ing func­tions, mov­ing away from the con­cept of ac­ces­sories at­tached to a smart­phone. This trend is re­ceiv­ing more at­ten­tion as it re­sponds well to the needs of re­cent con­sumers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ken­neth Liew, IDC’s Asi­aPa­cific as­so­ciate re­search direc­tor for de­vices, adds: “With more peo­ple run­ning or cy­cling dur­ing the pan­demic, sales of smart­watches to help track th­ese ac­tiv­i­ties have in­creased.”</p>
    <p>He notes that vir­tual races, which have taken off due to the sus­pen­sion of mass sport­ing events, have also helped push up sales of smart­watches as par­tic­i­pants have to do their own track­ing.</p>
    <p>Runs that have gone vir­tual this year in­clude The Straits Times Run and Stan­dard Char­tered Sin­ga­pore Marathon (SCSM).</p>
    <p>Mr Eu­gene Lim, who runs at least thrice a week, says: “I use my smart­watch for my runs be­cause it pro­vides re­li­able met­rics to track my train­ing progress.”</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old ac­count direc­tor of a mar­ket­ing agency, who wears a Garmin watch, is tak­ing part in the SCSM, which started in Au­gust and runs for 15 weeks. Last month, he also took part in a vir­tual global race where teams ran as much as they could in 31 hours and 15 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim says: “Fit­ness track­ing is key to be­ing a part of the vir­tual run­ning com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Stiff com­pe­ti­tion has also forced smart­watch-mak­ers to up their game.</p>
    <p>Mr Alexan­der Dehmel, Asi­aPa­cific mar­ket in­sights lead at mar­ket re­search firm GfK, says: “Ma­jor smart­watch brands, which are fac­ing (com­pe­ti­tion) from smaller play­ers of­fer­ing (cheaper op­tions) with sim­i­lar fea­tures, are pres­sured to of­fer more ad­vanced fea­tures to dif­fer­en­ti­ate them­selves and con­tinue charg­ing a pre­mium.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the elec­tro­car­dio­gram (ECG) func­tion has been avail­able since the Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 4 launched two years ago. The lat­est Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 6 is priced from $599.</p>
    <p>The Fit­bit Sense smart­watch, which was launched this month and re­tails at $488, even comes with a skin elec­tro­der­mal ac­tiv­ity sen­sor that is said to track the body’s re­ac­tion to stress.</p>
    <p>Some smart­watches retail for as low as $85 – for in­stance, those from brands like Hay­lou, a sub­sidiary of Chi­nese com­pany Xiaomi – but they do not come with bells and whis­tles like ECG or elec­tro­der­mal ac­tiv­ity sen­sors.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic re­la­tions con­sul­tant Mag­da­lene Ong, 28, who uses an Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 5, says: “The Ap­ple Watch not only looks good, but I can also get health mea­sure­ments like heart rate and ECG.”</p>
    <p>Mr Dehmel notes that some con­sumers like Ms Pereira may try wear­able de­vices with a ba­sic fit­ness tracker first. “And if they like the ex­pe­ri­ence, they may up­grade to smart­watches with more ad­vanced fea­tures,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Ms Pereira says she wanted to get a bet­ter fit­ness tracker, but de­cided on the Sam­sung smart­watch as it “seems able to do more for around the same price”.</p>
    <p>She adds: “It looks like a real watch and can track my work­outs and no­tify me of mes­sages and calls.”</p>
