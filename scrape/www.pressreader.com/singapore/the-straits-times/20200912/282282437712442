    <p>With promis­ing news sur­round­ing the de­vel­op­ment of dif­fer­ent Covid-19 vac­cines, many are anx­iously wait­ing for the day when the coronaviru­s can be ef­fec­tively elim­i­nated.</p>
    <p>But an ef­fec­tive vac­cine is likely to be in short sup­ply ini­tially, so the ques­tion arises: Should some coun­tries be pri­ori­tised by in­ter­na­tional dis­trib­u­tors to re­ceive the first batch?</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries may re­spond with “vac­cine na­tion­al­ism”, which hap­pens when coun­tries pri­ori­tise their own cit­i­zens first.</p>
    <p>Even if we ac­cept that coun­tries have pri­mary obli­ga­tions to­wards their own cit­i­zens and may le­git­i­mately weigh their peo­ple’s in­ter­ests more heav­ily, vac­cine na­tion­al­ism should not be ab­so­lute.</p>
    <p>Un­less a coun­try can her­met­i­cally seal it­self off from the rest of the world, ab­so­lute vac­cine na­tion­al­ism is go­ing to be coun­ter­pro­duc­tive to ad­vanc­ing a coun­try’s own in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>As we of­ten hear dur­ing this cri­sis, a global pandemic knows no bor­ders and no coun­try is safe un­less the virus is con­tained ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>More to the point, coun­tries have global re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Any at­tempt in vac­cine na­tion­al­ism that ig­nores those re­spon­si­bil­i­ties will be dif­fi­cult to jus­tify.</p>
    <p>Thus the ques­tion re­mains: What con­sti­tutes a fair in­ter­na­tional dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cine?</p>
    <p>It is not a mat­ter of sci­ence or pub­lic health, but of jus­tice – what is the fairest way to dis­trib­ute a scarce, valu­able re­source be­tween coun­tries?</p>
    <p>PRO­POR­TION­ATE DIS­TRI­BU­TION</p>
    <p>The val­ues of equal­ity, sol­i­dar­ity and in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion might sug­gest that any vac­cine should first be made avail­able as widely as pos­si­ble, to every coun­try around the world.</p>
    <p>One such dis­tribu­tive model has been pro­posed by the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion – ini­tially give every coun­try a sup­ply of vac­cines pro­por­tion­ate to its pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>In one tranche of dis­tri­bu­tion, all coun­tries around the world might first re­ceive doses suf­fi­cient for 3 per cent of their pop­u­la­tion re­gard­less of death rates, dis­ease spread or other fac­tors.</p>
    <p>So Sin­ga­pore, with a pop­u­la­tion of around 5.6 mil­lion, might re­ceive around 170,000 vac­cines in the first in­stance, while Bri­tain would re­ceive around two mil­lion for its 66.6 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>This is not a strictly equal dis­tri­bu­tion across coun­tries, since large coun­tries would re­ceive more doses of vac­cines, but it is equal in that each coun­try gets the same amount per capita.</p>
    <p>The pro­por­tion­ate dis­tri­bu­tion ap­proach may be seen as demon­strat­ing equal moral con­cern for per­sons across coun­tries, since all fac­tors about their coun­try other than pop­u­la­tion – in­clud­ing its in­fra­struc­ture, eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment and po­lit­i­cal sys­tem – are ir­rel­e­vant to ini­tial vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>THE FAIR PRI­OR­ITY MODEL</p>
    <p>An al­ter­na­tive is to pri­ori­tise cer­tain coun­tries over oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The jour­nal Sci­ence re­cently pub­lished a pa­per, of which we are among the co-au­thors, pro­vid­ing just such an al­ter­na­tive: the fair pri­or­ity model.</p>
    <p>The model has three over­ar­ch­ing prin­ci­ples – ben­e­fit­ing peo­ple and lim­it­ing harm; pri­ori­tis­ing the dis­ad­van­taged; and equal moral con­cern.</p>
    <p>Taken to­gether, these prin­ci­ples sug­gest an ap­proach dur­ing the first phase of in­ter­na­tional dis­tri­bu­tion: Pri­ori­tise those coun­tries in which peo­ple have the most ur­gent need for a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Though there are a va­ri­ety of eco­nomic and so­cial harms from a wide­spread Covid-19 out­break, the most sub­stan­tial harm is death.</p>
    <p>So, coun­tries where vac­cines would save the most years of life should at first be pri­ori­tised.</p>
    <p>Once deaths have been brought rel­a­tively un­der con­trol, other less ur­gent con­sid­er­a­tions like eco­nomic harms will be taken into ac­count.</p>
    <p>Thus our model con­ceives fair dis­tri­bu­tion in terms of three phases – sav­ing lives, re­duc­ing eco­nomic and so­cial de­pri­va­tions, and help­ing coun­tries re­turn to full func­tion­ing.</p>
    <p>This not only max­imises the ben­e­fits of a vac­cine, but also pri­ori­tises the dis­ad­van­taged by fo­cus­ing first on those coun­tries that have been made worse off by the virus, and demon­strates equal moral con­cern by treat­ing the value of a life equally, no mat­ter where that per­son lives in the world.</p>
    <p>Which coun­tries would re­ceive the vac­cine first in this model?</p>
    <p>This will de­pend on de­tailed anal­y­sis of the im­pact in terms of life years saved on dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>If cur­rent trends per­sist, coun­tries like the United States and Brazil might end up be­ing pri­ori­tised over Sin­ga­pore, since they have recorded higher deaths per capita and thus would likely save many more lives by re­ceiv­ing a given tranche of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>By the time a vac­cine is ready, how­ever, the sit­u­a­tion could shift.</p>
    <p>If Sin­ga­pore suf­fers a se­vere rise in deaths per capita, it would, on the fair pri­or­ity model, likely re­ceive greater pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>TRADE-OFFS</p>
    <p>No mat­ter which ap­proach is taken, there will be trade-offs in our val­ues.</p>
    <p>The pro­por­tion­ate dis­tri­bu­tion ap­proach is ar­guably in line with the norm of sol­i­dar­ity, em­pha­sis­ing that we are all af­fected by Covid-19 and that any ef­fec­tive vac­cine should be shared with the whole world.</p>
    <p>But it achieves this at the ex­pense of the in­ter­ests of those who need the vac­cine most.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries are suf­fer­ing far worse out­breaks than oth­ers, and there­fore their peo­ple would ben­e­fit much more from a po­ten­tially life-sav­ing vac­cine than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The fair pri­or­ity model puts peo­ple’s in­ter­ests front and cen­tre.</p>
    <p>In do­ing so, it might be seen as ob­jec­tion­ably pun­ish­ing coun­tries like Sin­ga­pore that ef­fec­tively kept death rates low, but at high eco­nomic and so­cial costs, while wrongly re­ward­ing coun­tries like the US and Brazil for their dras­tic do­mes­tic fail­ures.</p>
    <p>We should keep in view, though, that vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion is not about pun­ish­ment and re­ward – it is about al­le­vi­at­ing the harm­ful ef­fects of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Even if we could some­how as­cer­tain and mea­sure col­lec­tive re­spon­si­bil­ity for virus spread, in ur­gent cir­cum­stances, we should dis­trib­ute re­sources based on who needs them most, not who might de­serve them more.</p>
    <p>By way of com­par­i­son, it would be in­ap­pro­pri­ate for an emer­gency de­part­ment to pri­ori­tise treat­ment of an ac­ci­dent vic­tim who caused his own in­jury over one who was in­jured by a third party.</p>
    <p>More­over, it is only in the first phase of dis­tri­bu­tion un­der the fair pri­or­ity model where sav­ing lives is the most ur­gent con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond phase of our model, which we can rea­son­ably ex­pect to fol­low quickly be­hind the first phase once the most se­vere death rates are brought un­der con­trol, fair dis­tri­bu­tion will be sen­si­tive as well to the eco­nomic and so­cial costs of the pandemic on dif­fer­ent coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The very sub­stan­tial eco­nomic dis­rup­tion from Covid-19 in Sin­ga­pore may give it sub­stan­tial pri­or­ity in the sec­ond phase.</p>
    <p>Whether our pro­posed fair pri­or­ity model is adopted or a dif­fer­ent ap­proach taken, de­ter­min­ing a just dis­tribu­tive sys­tem can­not wait un­til a vac­cine is proven ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Dis­tribu­tive sys­tems must be es­tab­lished and op­er­a­tionalised well in ad­vance, so they can be rolled out with­out de­lay when the time comes.</p>
    <p>What is the most just and fair model for dis­tri­bu­tion must now be con­sid­ered and de­bated by stake­hold­ers around the world.</p>
