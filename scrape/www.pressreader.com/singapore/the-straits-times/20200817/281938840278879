    <p>It was a poke in the eye for Bei­jing when United States Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar landed in Tai­wan last week, the high­est-level Amer­i­can of­fi­cial to visit the self-gov­ern­ing is­land in four decades.</p>
    <p>China made known its dis­plea­sure by fly­ing fighter jets across the mid-line of the</p>
    <p>Tai­wan Strait into Tai­wan’s side of the sen­si­tive wa­ter­way the fol­low­ing day.</p>
    <p>But it did not stop there. The Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army’s East­ern The­atre Com­mand also held com­bat drills in the Tai­wan Strait in­clud­ing at its north­ern and south­ern ends around the time of Mr Azar’s visit.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last Thursday, a day after Mr Azar’s de­par­ture, the spokesman for the com­mand, Se­nior Colonel Zhang Chun­hui, said the ex­er­cises were “a nec­es­sary move re­spond­ing to the cur­rent se­cu­rity sit­u­a­tion in the Tai­wan Strait and were meant to safe­guard na­tional sovereignt­y”.</p>
    <p>Call­ing Tai­wan an in­dis­pens­able part of China, he said: “Re­cently, a cer­tain large coun­try has con­tin­ued to make neg­a­tive moves on Tai­wan-re­lated is­sues, send­ing se­ri­ous wrong sig­nals to ‘Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence’ forces, and se­ri­ously threat­en­ing the peace and sta­bil­ity of the Tai­wan Strait.”</p>
    <p>Bei­jing without a doubt was fu­ri­ous with the US, for it viewed the visit as a vi­o­la­tion of Wash­ing­ton’s “one China” pol­icy, which is the recog­ni­tion that the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China is the sole govern­ment of China.</p>
    <p>Since Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton es­tab­lished diplo­matic ties in 1979, the US has main­tained close but in­for­mal re­la­tions with Tai­wan in which the two sides’ high-level of­fi­cials do not meet al­though low-level of­fi­cials do.</p>
    <p>But Bei­jing is also con­cerned over the strength­en­ing of ties be­tween the US and Tai­wan in re­cent years, even as its own re­la­tions with the US have de­te­ri­o­rated since the start of the trade war be­tween them in 2018 – which has ex­panded into the tech­nol­ogy and in­vest­ment are­nas – and con­tinue to worsen with each pass­ing day.</p>
    <p>What is also wor­ri­some to Bei­jing is that Tai­wan’s govern­ment has used its closer ties with the US to buy more arms. The US un­der Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has stepped up sales of weapons to the is­land de­spite a 1982 com­mit­ment to grad­u­ally re­duce arms sales. The US has agreed to sell the lat­est model of the F-16 fighter jet and the two sides are in dis­cus­sion for Tai­wan to ac­quire un­der­wa­ter sea mines, to de­ter am­phibi­ous land­ings, and cruise mis­siles for coastal de­fence.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan is in­creas­ing its de­fence spend­ing as cross-strait ties have chilled since Ms Tsai Ing-wen of the in­de­pen­dence-lean­ing Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party came to power in 2016 and re­fused to ac­knowl­edge that there was a con­sen­sus in 1992 be­tween the two sides that there was just one China in the world (with each side hav­ing a dif­fer­ent view of what one China meant).</p>
    <p>For Tai­wan, bet­ter ties with the US is a boon in terms of its se­cu­rity. But it is a dou­ble-edged sword at a time when US-China ties are at a low point and the risks of not just a cold war but also a hot war be­tween the two ma­jor pow­ers have in­creased.</p>
    <p>Chang­ing US-Tai­wan ties</p>
    <p>The US’ ap­proach of keep­ing its ties with Tai­wan in­for­mal and not hav­ing con­tacts be­tween se­nior of­fi­cials started to change un­der Pres­i­dent Trump.</p>
    <p>It be­gan with Mr Trump’s elec­tion in 2016, when as pres­i­dent-elect he broke with con­ven­tion and ac­cepted a con­grat­u­la­tory phone call from Tai­wan’s Pres­i­dent Tsai.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the US en­acted the Na­tional De­fence Au­tho­ri­sa­tion</p>
    <p>Act that calls for mil­i­tary ships to make port calls in Tai­wan and the Tai­wan Travel Act that en­cour­ages se­nior-level civil­ian US of­fi­cials to visit Tai­wan, over­turn­ing strict bans on this. Mr Azar’s is the first such visit since this Act was passed.</p>
    <p>The Asia Re­as­sur­ance Ini­tia­tive Act signed in 2018 that pro­motes an Indo-Pa­cific re­gion diplo­matic strat­egy lists Tai­wan among the US’ most im­por­tant se­cu­rity part­ners in Asia and calls for reg­u­lar arms sales to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, Mr Trump signed the Tai­wan Al­lies In­ter­na­tional Pro­tec­tion and En­hance­ment Ini­tia­tive Act that was passed last year. The new leg­is­la­tion says the US should give sup­port to Tai­wan in its ef­forts to strengthen its re­la­tion­ships with coun­tries and in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>These US moves have taken place against a back­drop of de­te­ri­o­rat­ing ties be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing and as the US un­der Mr Trump sees China as a strate­gic ri­val to be con­strained. Some an­a­lysts, there­fore, are of the view that Tai­wan is be­ing used as a pawn by the US in its re­la­tions with China.</p>
    <p>In­deed, China’s na­tion­al­is­tic tabloid Global Times in an ar­ti­cle on Mr Azar’s visit warned that Tai­wan was be­ing turned by the Amer­i­cans into a “gun­pow­der keg for the Sino-US game”.</p>
    <p>The Tai­wanese, for their part, wel­come these US moves as they strengthen their ties with the US par­tic­u­larly at a time when their own ties with Bei­jing have been wors­en­ing.</p>
    <p>China had cut off of­fi­cial con­tact with Tai­wan – es­tab­lished dur­ing the rule of the China-friendly Tai­wanese pres­i­dent Ma Ying-jeou (2008-2016) – after Ms Tsai came to power, be­cause of her fail­ure to ac­cept the “one China” prin­ci­ple.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has also squeezed the is­land’s in­ter­na­tional space by poach­ing its diplo­matic al­lies and block­ing its par­tic­i­pa­tion in in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions such as the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion. It has in­creased its mil­i­tary ex­er­cises in the Tai­wan Strait to show its mil­i­tary might.</p>
    <p>Yet, while Tai­wan seeks bet­ter ties with the US as a buf­fer against the Chi­nese main­land, it risks alien­at­ing Bei­jing even more if it leans too much to­wards Wash­ing­ton. China’s lat­est mil­i­tary ma­noeu­vres in the Tai­wan Strait are a sign of this.</p>
    <p>At a time when US-China ties are be­com­ing more volatile, Tai­wan needs to ex­er­cise pru­dence and cau­tion to keep it­self from be­com­ing caught in any con­flict be­tween the two ma­jor pow­ers.</p>
    <p>A con­cil­ia­tory ap­proach to­wards China, sep­a­rated from it by only a 160km stretch of wa­ter, and keep­ing its ties with the Chi­nese main­land peace­ful and stable are in Tai­wan’s long-term in­ter­ests.</p>
