    <p>•</p>
    <p>Spain needs dras­tic mea­sures to com­bat an out-of-con­trol new wave of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and is con­sid­er­ing new re­stric­tions, in­clud­ing cur­fews, Health Min­is­ter Sal­vador Illa said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Spain on Wed­nes­day be­came the first coun­try in Western Europe to have recorded more than one mil­lion cases of the virus.</p>
    <p>“The sec­ond wave is a real­ity. In many ar­eas of our coun­try, the epi­demic is out of con­trol,” Mr Illa told Onda Cero ra­dio. “I in­sist we have to take dras­tic mea­sures, as do sev­eral re­gions,” he said.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of re­gions are ad­vo­cat­ing lo­calised cur­fews such as those im­ple­mented in France and other Euro­pean coun­tries with lower in­fec­tion rates, he said.</p>
    <p>Des­per­ate to avoid a re­peat of the first wave, when the virus rav­aged Spain’s el­derly pop­u­la­tion and brought the health ser­vice to its knees, sev­eral re­gions have al­ready taken steps, in­clud­ing telling restau­rants to shut down ear­lier than usual.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with a two-week lock­down of Madrid and sur­round­ing cities com­ing to an end today and the con­ta­gion rates grow­ing, more needs to be done, Mr Illa said.</p>
    <p>“We are at the doorstep of win­ter, when most ac­tiv­i­ties are car­ried out in­doors, when prob­a­bil­ity of virus con­ta­gion is higher. We can­not lower our guard,” he said. “The hori­zon we have been dis­cussing with tech­ni­cians from the min­istry and Euro­pean col­leagues is of five to six very hard months.”</p>
    <p>While daily deaths have been hov­er­ing around 100 – a far cry from the peak of nearly 900 reg­is­tered in late March – hos­pi­tal ad­mis­sions have jumped 20 per cent na­tion­wide, trig­ger­ing warn­ings that some non-ur­gent op­er­a­tions may need to be post­poned.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Span­ish Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day threw out, as ex­pected, a mo­tion of no con­fi­dence in So­cial­ist Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez, launched by the far­right Vox party and dis­missed as a “cir­cus show” by the main con­ser­va­tive op­po­si­tion Peo­ple’s Party.</p>
    <p>The mo­tion was re­jected by 298-52 votes. Vox, which ar­gued that the mi­nor­ity left­ist coali­tion govern­ment had botched the han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, was the only party that voted for it, a day after the coun­try’s in­fec­tions hit one mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Spain, which is home to around 47 mil­lion peo­ple, is only the sixth coun­try in the world to cross this grim mile­stone after the United States, In­dia, Brazil, Rus­sia and Ar­gentina, ac­cord­ing to an Agence France-Presse tally based on of­fi­cial fig­ures.</p>
    <p>The new wave of con­ta­gion has been less deadly than that in late March and April, as the me­dian age of new in­fec­tions has dropped.</p>
    <p>Spain was one of the worst-af­fected coun­tries when the coro­n­avirus struck Europe early this year, be­fore one of the world’s most strin­gent lock­downs helped re­duce the out­break’s spread.</p>
    <p>But in­fec­tions have surged since the lock­down mea­sures were fully re­moved at the end of June, with the rise blamed on the rapid re­turn of nightlife and a lack of an ef­fi­cient sys­tem to track and trace in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Messy dis­agree­ments be­tween the cen­tral and re­gional gov­ern­ments, and be­tween po­lit­i­cal par­ties, over what mea­sures to take have also ham­pered the re­sponse, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has been used as a po­lit­i­cal weapon to fight and ar­gue with your ad­ver­saries in­stead of try­ing to find a mid­dle ground and the best so­lu­tion for ev­ery­one,” health sci­ences ex­pert Sal­vador Macip of Cat­alo­nia’s Open Univer­sity told AFP.</p>
    <p>As in­fec­tions picked up, the Span­ish re­gional au­thor­i­ties started im­pos­ing fresh re­stric­tions. Madrid and sev­eral satel­lite cities have since early this month been un­der a par­tial lock­down, while the wealthy north-eastern re­gion of Cat­alo­nia has im­posed a 15-day shut­down of all bars and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>The north­ern wine-grow­ing re­gion of La Rioja an­nounced on Wed­nes­day that it would close its re­gional bor­ders, while the north-eastern re­gion of Aragon said it would im­pose a par­tial lock­down on its three big­gest cities – Huesca, Teruel and Zaragoza.</p>
    <p>Dr Angela Her­nan­dez Puente, who is the deputy sec­re­tary of Madrid’s Am­tys med­i­cal as­so­ci­a­tion, said the sit­u­a­tion was very wor­ry­ing, but not com­pa­ra­ble with the over­whelm­ing pres­sure that the health sys­tem came un­der in March when in­ten­sive care units were full and staff lacked per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>But she said the gains of Spain’s tough lock­down were wasted due to a lack of prepa­ra­tion for a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions, cit­ing as an ex­am­ple the fail­ure to hire more doc­tors for pub­lic pri­mary care cen­tres, the first line of de­fence against the virus as they han­dle test­ing and trac­ing po­ten­tial cases as well as treat­ing the sick.</p>
    <p>“Health­care staff are tired and an­gry, many doc­tors feel that more should have been done in June, July and Au­gust to not let the pub­lic health sys­tem be­come over­bur­dened as it is now,” she told AFP.</p>
