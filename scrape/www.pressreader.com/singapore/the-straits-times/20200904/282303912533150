    <p>A class ac­tion in Aus­tralia is be­ing launched against the Vic­to­rian state govern­ment by busi­nesses which say fail­ures to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19 led to the cur­rent costly lock­down.</p>
    <p>The law­suit, which is set to be one of the largest class ac­tions in Aus­tralian his­tory, will ex­am­ine the cru­cial ques­tion of govern­ment li­a­bil­ity for busi­ness losses caused by po­ten­tially avoid­able shut­downs.</p>
    <p>Com­pen­sa­tion could be in the bil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>The lead plain­tiff is a restau­rant in Mel­bourne, but thou­sands of Vic­to­ria’s 650,000 busi­nesses are ex­pected to join the law­suit.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant owner, Mr An­thony Fer­rara, said the store’s rev­enue has dropped sub­stan­tially dur­ing the lock­down and it is able to serve take­away food only.</p>
    <p>“Our sit­u­a­tion is not our do­ing,” he told The Aus­tralian Fi­nan­cial Re­view.</p>
    <p>“We are call­ing to ac­count those who put us in this dire po­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria is cur­rently near­ing the end of a six-week lock­down that has in­volved the clo­sure of schools and most busi­nesses, as well as an 8pm to 5am cur­few.</p>
    <p>The state recorded 70 new</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cases on Tues­day, the low­est level in two months.</p>
    <p>Case num­bers have fallen sharply since a peak of 725 new in­fec­tions on Aug 5. The state’s re­stric­tions are due to ease from Sept 13.</p>
    <p>Out­side Vic­to­ria, most states and ter­ri­to­ries have been record­ing few or no new cases of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the only new cases were in New South Wales, which recorded 13, and Queens­land, which had two.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s out­break be­gan to run ram­pant in early June, end­ing a pe­riod of al­most no com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>It is be­lieved to have started with the in­fec­tion of se­cu­rity guards at two quar­an­tine ho­tels in Mel­bourne.</p>
    <p>This has prompted crit­i­cism of the state govern­ment over con­cerns it should have em­ployed the po­lice and the mil­i­tary rather than pri­vate se­cu­rity guards and that it failed to adopt ad­e­quate health and safety pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>A pub­lic in­quiry is cur­rently in­ves­ti­gat­ing the cause of the ho­tel out­break. It is due to de­liver its re­port by Nov 6.</p>
    <p>A lawyer lead­ing the class ac­tion, Mr Damian Scat­tini, from the firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sul­li­van, said the plain­tiffs will ar­gue that the fail­ures that led to the spread of Covid-19 cases from des­ig­nated ho­tels were avoid­able and un­rea­son­able.</p>
    <p>“It’s not the fact they put the sec­ond lock­down into ef­fect, it’s the fact it was done af­ter the botched ho­tel quar­an­tine,” Mr Scat­tini told the SmartCom­pany web­site.</p>
    <p>“(The virus) was con­tain­able and con­tained un­til the ho­tel quar­an­tine was messed up.”</p>
    <p>Le­gal ex­perts gave mixed views on whether the case would suc­ceed.</p>
    <p>The dean of Swin­burne Law School, Pro­fes­sor Mirko Ba­garic, said the Vic­to­rian govern­ment’s de­ci­sion to use pri­vate se­cu­rity guards at quar­an­tine ho­tels ap­peared to be a “pro­found er­ror of judg­ment”.</p>
    <p>He said that the plain­tiffs may be able to show these fail­ings caused the out­break be­cause epi­demi­o­log­i­cal ev­i­dence in­di­cates that al­most all cases in the cur­rent wave can be traced to the two quar­an­tine ho­tels.</p>
    <p>But a suc­cess­ful le­gal ac­tion, Prof Ba­garic added, would lead to “al­most in­cal­cu­la­ble” dam­ages that could fi­nan­cially crip­ple the state.</p>
    <p>“The only way to avoid this po­ten­tial le­gal catas­tro­phe for the state is for the govern­ment to leg­is­late to grant it­self i mmu­nity from any Covid-19-based le­gal ac­tions,” he wrote in The Aus­tralian.</p>
    <p>“The choice be­tween risk­ing state fi­nan­cial ruin by be­ing drawn into a pan­demic class ac­tion or un­der­min­ing a cor­ner­stone of democ­racy is not an en­vi­able one.”</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s shut­down is set to cost the coun­try about A$12 bil­lion (S$11.95 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>But the state is start­ing to pre­pare to re­turn to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Premier Daniel An­drews will an­nounce a road map for eas­ing re­stric­tions on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The plan will be based on dis­cus­sions this week with busi­nesses groups, unions and com­mu­nity or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>“It’s about a steady and safe eas­ing out of these rules and then find­ing a nor­mal that we can lock in for many, many months,” Mr An­drews said on Tues­day.</p>
