    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United mid­fielder Paul Pogba will soon be­gin talks with the club over a new con­tract and will not be leav­ing in the cur­rent trans­fer win­dow, his agent Mino Raiola has con­firmed.</p>
    <p>The France in­ter­na­tional has fre­quently been linked with a move away from Old Traf­ford since re­join­ing the Premier League club from Ju­ven­tus in 2016.</p>
    <p>But hav­ing formed a po­tent mid­field part­ner­ship with Jan­uary sign­ing Bruno Fer­nan­des in the clos­ing months of the cam­paign, Pogba has had a change of heart and is ready to com­mit his fu­ture to United.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to speak about a new con­tract soon,” Raiola told Sky Sports on Sun­day. “Paul will stay at Manch­ester.</p>
    <p>“He is a key player. They have an im­por­tant project and he’s 100 per cent in­cluded. United will not ac­cept any bid this sum­mer to sell Pogba.”</p>
    <p>Pogba, who has one sea­son left on his United con­tract, spent a large part of last cam­paign out in­jured, making just eight ap­pear­ances in all com­pe­ti­tions be­fore the English top flight was sus­pended in March due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he fea­tured 14 times in all com­pe­ti­tions when the league re­sumed in June, help­ing the Red Devils fin­ish third to qual­ify for next sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League af­ter a year’s ab­sence.</p>
    <p>While United fin­ished tro­phy­less for the third sea­son in a row, they reached the semi-fi­nals of the League Cup, the FA Cup, as well as the Europa League, where they were beaten by even­tual cham­pi­ons Sevilla.</p>
    <p>If United are to end their sil­ver­ware drought next term, keep­ing hold of Pogba will be a key facet of man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer’s plans, ac­cord­ing to their for­mer goal­keeper Mark Bos­nich.</p>
    <p>Call­ing Pogba’s U-turn “tremen­dous news”, the for­mer Aus­tralia in­ter­na­tional told Sky Sports yes­ter­day: “First and fore­most, if you wanted to re­place him, who would you re­place him with?</p>
    <p>“The part­ner­ship we have seen with Fer­nan­des, which has been suc­cess­ful al­ready, au­gurs well for the fu­ture. He is the fu­ture and I think it’s a re­ally good move, not just for him but for Manch­ester United, to keep him at the club.”</p>
