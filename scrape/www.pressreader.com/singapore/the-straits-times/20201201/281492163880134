    <p>NO PROB­LEMS WITH SIZES</p>
    <p>I didn’t have any is­sues de­ter­min­ing the size of the masks as I of­ten buy masks for the fam­ily, so I have a good gauge of what to get.</p>
    <p>A RES­I­DENT, who de­clined to be named.</p>
    <p>TIME FOR NEW MASK</p>
    <p>I have been us­ing the masks given out by Te­masek in the pre­vi­ous round of distri­bu­tion, which have got loose from fre­quent wash­ing, so it is time for a change.</p>
    <p>MS ANGELA KOH, who works in pro­cure­ment. She was col­lect­ing masks for her­self and her mother-in-law at Hwi Yoh Com­mu­nity Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Col­lect­ing the new reusable face masks was a smooth process for many Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents on the first day of distri­bu­tion by Te­masek Foun­da­tion yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Those whom The Straits Times spoke to said the vend­ing ma­chines were easy to use as they sim­ply had to select their mask size and scan their iden­ti­fi­ca­tion card. Each per­son is en­ti­tled to one free mask kit, which con­tains a pair of reusable masks and three mask fil­ters.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 1,200 vend­ing ma­chines are lo­cated is­land­wide at more than 800 lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing bus in­ter­changes, com­mu­nity cen­tres and res­i­dents’ com­mit­tee cen­tres, as well as Te­masek Shop­house and Plaza Sin­ga­pura, in this third round of mask distri­bu­tion by the foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>When ST vis­ited Chong Pang Com­mu­nity Cen­tre and Nee Soon Cen­tral Com­mu­nity Cen­tre yes­ter­day morn­ing, there were small queues of five to six groups of peo­ple at each vend­ing ma­chine.</p>
    <p>Staff and vol­un­teers were also de­ployed at most lo­ca­tions to help users select the cor­rect mask sizes.</p>
    <p>The masks are avail­able in four sizes – small, medium, large and ex­tra large – with the small ones in­tended for chil­dren un­der eight.</p>
    <p>A res­i­dent, 67, who wanted to be known only as Mr Goh, col­lected a large-size mask at Chong Pang Com­mu­nity Cen­tre. He said that hav­ing staff around helped him to select his size more ac­cu­rately.</p>
    <p>An­other res­i­dent, who de­clined to be named, was there with her daugh­ter to col­lect the masks: “I didn’t have any is­sues de­ter­min­ing the size of the masks as I of­ten buy masks for the fam­ily, so I have a good gauge of what to get.”</p>
    <p>The girl said she had se­lected the medium size for her­self in­stead of small as her mother had sug­gested that they save them for fu­ture use.</p>
    <p>Ms Angela Koh, 61, who works in pro­cure­ment, was col­lect­ing masks for her­self and her mother-in-law at Hwi Yoh Com­mu­nity Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>She felt this round of mask distri­bu­tion was timely, and she hoped the masks would be as com­fort­able as the pre­vi­ous ones. “I have been us­ing the masks given out by Te­masek in the pre­vi­ous round of distri­bu­tion, which have got loose from fre­quent wash­ing, so it is time for a change,” she said.</p>
    <p>She picked an L-sized mask for her­self as its mea­sure­ments were close to the medium-sized ones, but could cover a larger area of her face, es­pe­cially at the chin.</p>
    <p>The mask distri­bu­tion ex­er­cise will end on Dec 13.</p>
