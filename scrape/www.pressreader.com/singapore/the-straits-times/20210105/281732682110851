    <p>The po­lice can ob­tain any data un­der Sin­ga­pore’s ju­ris­dic­tion for the pur­poses of crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions, and this in­cludes TraceTo­gether data, Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs Des­mond Tan told the House yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Christo­pher de Souza (Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC) had asked if data col­lected un­der the pro­gramme will be used for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions, a con­cern ex­pressed by some on­line.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan replied that TraceTo­gether was con­ceived and im­ple­mented for con­tact trac­ing to fight Covid-19, and mea­sures had been put in place to pro­tect the data. But this does not pre­clude its use in crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions as the po­lice are em­pow­ered un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code to ob­tain the data for such probes, he added.</p>
    <p>In this re­gard, he said, data col­lected by TraceTo­gether is treated like any other data un­der Sin­ga­pore’s ju­ris­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>Asked by Work­ers’ Party’s Mr Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC) if this is in vi­o­la­tion of the TraceTo­gether pri­vacy state­ment, Mr Tan said that other than for such in­ves­ti­ga­tions, the data is “in­deed to be used only for con­tact trac­ing and for the pur­pose of fight­ing (the) Covid sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>As cus­to­dian of the TraceTo­gether data, he added, the Govern­ment has put in place strin­gent mea­sures such as al­low­ing only au­tho­rised of­fi­cers to ac­cess it, us­ing it only for au­tho­rised pur­poses and stor­ing it on se­cured servers. Un­der the Pub­lic Sec­tor (Gov­er­nance) Act, pub­lic of­fi­cers who reck­lessly or know­ingly dis­close the data with­out au­tho­ri­sa­tion or mis­use it may be fined $5,000, jailed for two years, or both, he said.</p>
    <p>His re­ply sparked de­bate on­line about whether this was an about-turn. Some cited past re­marks by Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong and For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan on TraceTo­gether data be­ing used only for con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the TraceTo­gether Pri­vacy Safe­guards page was up­dated to re­flect how the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code ap­plies to the data. It states that data shared with the Health Min­istry will be used for Covid-19 con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>This note was added: “Also, we want to be trans­par­ent with you. TraceTo­gether data may be used in cir­cum­stances where ci­ti­zen safety and se­cu­rity is or has been af­fected.</p>
    <p>“Au­tho­rised po­lice of­fi­cers may in­voke Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code (CPC) pow­ers to re­quest users to up­load their TraceTo­gether data for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions. The Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force is em­pow­ered un­der the CPC to ob­tain any data, in­clud­ing TraceTo­gether data, for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions.”</p>
