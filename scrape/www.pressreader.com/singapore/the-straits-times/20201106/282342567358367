    <p>As sport worldwide came to a months-long stand­still from March ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic, fans were starved of live sports ac­tion as sports leagues and events were put on hold, post­poned or canned.</p>
    <p>This de­pri­va­tion was ev­i­dent when live sports edged back into ac­tion in the mid­dle of the year, as so­cial me­dia plat­form Twit­ter ob­served a surge in global sports con­ver­sa­tions, which are tweets about any­thing sports-re­lated.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Twit­ter, there were 1.8 bil­lion sports-re­lated tweets worldwide from Jan­uary to July, a 63.6 per cent in­crease from the 1.1 bil­lion tweets dur­ing the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion saw a 59 per cent in­crease in the num­ber of sports con­ver­sa­tions from May to June.</p>
    <p>For­mula One proved to be a hot topic worldwide when it restarted with the Aus­trian Grand Prix in July as there were 1.9 mil­lion tweets worldwide in the week that fol­lowed, more than 21/ times the</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>698,000 tweets gen­er­ated in the first week of the 2019 sea­son.</p>
    <p>Mau­r­izio Bar­bieri, Twit­ter’s head of sports and gam­ing part­ner­ships for South-east Asia and Greater China, told The Straits Times in a video in­ter­view: “When you are at the ac­tual event, you are watch­ing some­thing but you might not be keen on us­ing the phone.</p>
    <p>“The fact that we are not go­ing to the sports venues leaves you with only one op­tion – to talk among each other by us­ing Twit­ter.”</p>
    <p>WHAT WAS HOT IN SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>With Ger­many’s Bun­desliga the first European foot­ball league to restart in mid-May, con­ti­nen­tal leagues were the most talked about this year in Sin­ga­pore up till Mon­day with 651,300 tweets. The English Pre­mier League, which saw Liver­pool crowned cham­pi­ons af­ter a three-decade wait, was sec­ond with 609,700 tweets, while the rest of English foot­ball was third (467,200).</p>
    <p>In the lo­cal Twit­ter­sphere, the late bas­ket­ball leg­end Kobe Bryant (172,400) was the most talked­about ath­lete of the year to date. News broke in Jan­uary that the former Los An­ge­les Lak­ers star had been killed in a he­li­copter crash in Cal­i­for­nia along with his daugh­ter Gianna and seven oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Com­ing in sec­ond and third re­spec­tively were Por­tu­gal and Ju­ven­tus striker Cris­tiano Ron­aldo (58,200) and Manch­ester United’s Mar­cus Rash­ford (53,000), who made the news for his ex­ploits on and off the pitch as he cam­paigned for food do­na­tions for un­der­priv­i­leged chil­dren in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Other high-pro­file foot­ballers such as Barcelona su­per­star Lionel Messi (43,100) also made the top 10 most-talked about ath­letes on Twit­ter in Sin­ga­pore, with the Ar­gen­tinian foot­baller mak­ing head­lines in Au­gust for want­ing to leave the Cata­lan club.</p>
    <p>Trans­fer talk also put Arsenal’s Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang (25,100) on the list, while the move of Por­tuguese Bruno Fer­nan­des (48,200) to United ear­lier this year was also a hot topic on the so­cial me­dia plat­form.</p>
    <p>The World Wrestling En­ter­tain­ment (WWE) made a sur­prise slam into the top 10 lists for sports leagues and ath­letes here, com­ing in at ninth for sports leagues while wrestler John Cena was the eighth most talked-about ath­lete.</p>
    <p>TWIT­TER STILL A GI­ANT</p>
    <p>Bar­bieri be­lieves that the trends seen on Twit­ter this year are enough to re­fute claims that it is be­com­ing ir­rel­e­vant in a vast so­cial me­dia land­scape that in­cludes Face­book, In­sta­gram and TikTok.</p>
    <p>Forbes re­ported last year that the num­ber of daily tweet­ing users had dropped by 100 mil­lion from 2012 to 2018. The so­cial me­dia site has since changed its user met­ric to count mon­eti­s­able daily ac­tive users, which is any­one who con­sumes a tweet in a way that they can be shown ad­ver­tise­ments, and has seen a steady in­crease in the num­ber of such users.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of mon­eti­s­able daily ac­tive users grew to 186 mil­lion in the sec­ond quar­ter on av­er­age, up 34 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>Bar­bieri said: “In the past 10 months, we’ve shown peo­ple why we are so in­flu­en­tial and not just for sport, but the fact that sports dis­ap­peared and all of a sud­den peo­ple started talk­ing about it showed our strength in this ver­ti­cal.”</p>
    <p>He is al­ready gear­ing up for a busy 2021, which will fea­ture the post­poned Euro 2020 foot­ball tour­na­ment and the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
    <p>For the 2018 World Cup Fi­nals in Rus­sia, Twit­ter brought near re­al­time high­lights and videos of the tour­na­ment to fans on the plat­form via deals with var­i­ous tele­vi­sion net­works and broad­cast­ers in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>While Bar­bieri did not re­veal more de­tails about Twit­ter’s plans for the two ma­jor sports events next year, he said: “It is go­ing to be a mas­sive year for sport and that’s where Twit­ter shines. The idea is to keep work­ing with our part­ners so that when we turn to 2021 with big events, that’s when we can bring all the fans to­gether like in 2018.”</p>
