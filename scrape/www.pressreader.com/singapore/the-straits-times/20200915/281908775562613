    <p>HEN­DER­SON (Ne­vada) • Thou­sands of Trump sup­port­ers, the vast ma­jor­ity of them for­go­ing face masks, packed into a man­u­fac­tur­ing plant on Sun­day night in a Las Vegas sub­urb, where Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump brashly ig­nored a state di­rec­tive lim­it­ing in­door gath­er­ings to fewer than 50 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>There were no signs of any at­tempts at so­cial dis­tanc­ing in­side the venue.</p>
    <p>At­ten­dees wear­ing red Maga (Make Amer­ica great again) caps sat in white fold­ing chairs crammed to­gether on the floor of the Xtreme Man­u­fac­tur­ing plant, which said on its web­site that it had “re­stricted meet­ings and gath­er­ings to no more than 10 peo­ple in large ar­eas”.</p>
    <p>In his re­marks, Mr Trump un­loaded his reg­u­lar, in­ac­cu­rate on­slaught against for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, falsely ac­cus­ing him of wag­ing a “dan­ger­ous war on the po­lice” and claim­ing that “he’s shot and ev­ery­body knows it”.</p>
    <p>The rau­cous crowd ap­peared to relish the per­for­mance, at one point chant­ing “all lives mat­ter!” when a pro­tester tried to dis­rupt the Pres­i­dent’s re­marks.</p>
    <p>Hop­ing to cap­i­talise on Mr Bi­den’s vul­ner­a­bil­ity with Latino vot­ers in the state – he won just 17 per cent of the Latino vote in the Ne­vada cau­cuses, com­pared with 50 per cent for Sen­a­tor Bernie San­ders – Mr Trump claimed that his Demo­cratic ri­val would be a “dis­as­ter for His­panic Amer­i­cans”.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, Mr Trump, who en­tered the po­lit­i­cal arena by call­ing Mex­i­cans “rapists” who were bring­ing drugs and crime into the coun­try, held a round-ta­ble ses­sion with Latino small-busi­ness own­ers.</p>
    <p>At the rally, he claimed: “Some say, ‘Call us Latino.’ Oth­ers say, ‘Call us His­panic.’ Oth­ers say, ‘Call us what­ever the hell you want, we love you’.”</p>
    <p>The campaign’s de­ci­sion to hold Sun­day’s rally in­doors came after two out­door ral­lies in the state were scut­tled, one be­cause the RenoTa­hoe Air­port Au­thor­ity in­formed the ten­ants who lease the hangar there that the event was in vi­o­la­tion of the state di­rec­tive lim­it­ing gath­er­ings to fewer than 50 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The campaign then vet­ted five dif­fer­ent out­door venues, all of which were blocked by the gov­er­nor, ac­cord­ing to an ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial fa­mil­iar with the plan­ning.</p>
    <p>It set­tled on the in­door man­u­fac­tur­ing plant as a last re­sort, adding ex­tra ven­ti­la­tion and keep­ing the doors open.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing the de­ci­sion to gather sup­port­ers in­side in the middle of the coro­n­avirus out­break, Mr Tim Mur­taugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said in a state­ment: “If you can join tens of thou­sands of peo­ple protest­ing in the streets, gam­ble in a casino, or burn down small busi­nesses in ri­ots, you can gather peace­fully un­der the First Amend­ment to hear from the pres­i­dent of the United States.”</p>
    <p>On Sun­day night, Mr Trump pitched his event as a form of en­ter­tain­ment while barely ac­knowl­edg­ing that he was head­lin­ing a cam</p>
    <p>paign rally in­doors for the first time since June 20, when he was greeted in Tulsa, Ok­la­homa, by an arena that was more than half empty.</p>
    <p>He also made no men­tion of the pan­demic’s death toll, even as it con­tin­ues to kill hun­dreds of Amer­i­cans a day.</p>
