    <p>I write in re­sponse to the cu­ri­ous si­lence from the Changi Air­port Group (CAG) re­gard­ing the re­cent news in­volv­ing its chair­man Mr Liew Mun Leong (For­mer maid ac­quit­ted of theft from home of CAG chair­man, Sept 5).</p>
    <p>Given that CAG is a key player in the econ­omy of Sin­ga­pore, it is sur­pris­ing that it has not taken any swift ac­tion to ad­dress con­cerns about the suit­abil­ity of Mr Liew to con­tinue helm­ing the board.</p>
    <p>In clear­ing the maid of the charges, the High Court judge de­ter­mined that there was “im­proper mo­tive” on the part of Mr Liew to pre­vent the worker from lodg­ing a com­plaint against him and his fam­ily for il­le­gal de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>It may be ar­gued, there­fore, that Mr Liew can­not ful­fil his role at CAG un­til things are cleared.</p>
    <p>Apart from busi­ness smarts, a board di­rec­tor’s char­ac­ter, or at least a lack of mis­con­duct even in a per­sonal ca­pac­ity, is in­te­gral in pro­tect­ing the in­ter­ests of an or­gan­i­sa­tion’s stake­hold­ers and em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>When doubt is cast over one’s in­tegrity, this can threaten to per­co­late and bring on dis­re­pute to an or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause con­sumers, like it or not, link an or­gan­i­sa­tion’s lead­er­ship to the val­ues that the com­pany stands for.</p>
    <p>More­over, it may be ar­gued that CAG’s stake­hold­ers go be­yond that of a typ­i­cal cor­po­ra­tion. As a key driver be­hind Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess story, CAG’s stake­hold­ers in­clude Sin­ga­pore­ans as well.</p>
    <p>It is im­per­a­tive that CAG breaks its si­lence over this.</p>
