    <p>GENEVA The Saudi trial into the killing of critic Ja­mal Khashoggi lacked trans­parency and fell short on as­sign­ing ac­count­abil­ity for the crime, the United Na­tions hu­man rights of­fice said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A court in Saudi Ara­bia on Mon­day jailed eight peo­ple for be­tween seven and 20 years over the 2018 mur­der of Mr Khashoggi, a Saudi jour­nal­ist, state me­dia re­ported, four months af­ter his fam­ily for­gave his killers and en­abled death sen­tences to be set aside.</p>
    <p>Mr Ru­pert Colville, spokesman for the rights of­fice, noted that the UN op­poses the death penalty. He told a Geneva brief­ing: “This is a case where there has not been proper trans­parency in the jus­tice process – those re­spon­si­ble should be pros­e­cuted and given sen­tences com­men­su­rate with the crime.”</p>
    <p>A critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Sal­man, Mr Khashoggi was last seen at the Saudi con­sulate in Is­tan­bul on Oct 2, 2018, where he had gone to ob­tain doc­u­ments for his im­pend­ing wed­ding. His body was re­port­edly dis­mem­bered and re­moved from the build­ing and his re­mains have not been found.</p>
    <p>The mur­der caused a global up­roar and tar­nished the re­formist im­age of Prince Mo­hammed, the king­dom’s de facto ruler.</p>
    <p>The Khashoggi fam­ily’s lawyer, Mr Mo­tasem Khashoggi, told AlSharq Al-Awsat news­pa­per that the fam­ily wel­comes the “fair and de­ter­rent” rul­ing and is sat­is­fied by it.</p>
    <p>But Mr Khashoggi’s fi­ancee said the eight jailed were not the only ones re­spon­si­ble for the mur­der.</p>
    <p>“The Saudi au­thor­i­ties are clos­ing the case with­out the world know­ing the truth of who is re­spon­si­ble for Ja­mal’s mur­der,” Ms Hat­ice Cen­giz wrote in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Who planned it, who or­dered it, where is his body?”</p>
    <p>Some Western gov­ern­ments, as well as the US’ Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency, had pre­vi­ously said that they be­lieved Prince Mo­hammed had or­dered the killing.</p>
    <p>Turkey, which launched its own trial against 20 Saudi of­fi­cials in July, said the ver­dict in Saudi Ara­bia fell short of ex­pec­ta­tions, and urged the Saudi au­thor­i­ties to co­op­er­ate with its in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
