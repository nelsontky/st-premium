    <p>(Wis­con­sin) Pros­e­cu­tors in Wis­con­sin have cleared a white po­lice of­fi­cer of crim­i­nal charges in the shoot­ing of a black man from be­hind in the pres­ence of his young chil­dren, leav­ing him paral­ysed and trig­ger­ing deadly protests that in­flamed racial ten­sions in the US.</p>
    <p>Kenosha County District At­tor­ney Michael Grav­e­ley on Tues­day found of­fi­cer Rusten Sh­eskey acted in self-de­fence while re­spond­ing to a do­mes­tic dis­pute last Aug 23, and shoot­ing Mr Ja­cob Blake seven times at close range, say­ing Mr Blake was armed with a knife and had re­sisted ar­rest, de­spite mul­ti­ple Taser shots.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion against prose­cut­ing Mr Sh­eskey or the two other of­fi­cers on the scene could in­cite more demon­stra­tions, which have fre­quently bro­ken out in the United States in re­cent years af­ter po­lice have been cleared of wrong­do­ing in shoot­ings of African Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>The city was calm af­ter dark as about 50 peo­ple braved sub­freez­ing tem­per­a­tures and marched through streets where store­fronts had been boarded up in an­tic­i­pa­tion of un­rest.</p>
    <p>“This is an ex­pres­sion of our deep suf­fer­ing,” said Mr Caliph Muab’El, a black min­is­ter, as he fol­lowed in a car be­hind the marchers. “I wasn’t sur­prised by the de­ci­sion. It’s a per­pet­u­a­tion of the same old, same old that we see in this coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Kenosha, a city of 100,000 peo­ple be­tween Mil­wau­kee and Chicago, had braced it­self for the de­ci­sion, and Wis­con­sin Gover­nor Tony Evers au­tho­rised the Wis­con­sin Na­tional Guard to sup­port lo­cal law en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>Protests broke out last sum­mer in re­sponse to vi­ral cell­phone video show­ing Mr Blake walk­ing around the front of his car with Mr Sh­eskey fol­low­ing and shoot­ing af­ter Mr Blake opened the door.</p>
    <p>But in­ves­ti­ga­tors said the video was in­com­plete, fail­ing to re­veal that Mr Blake was armed with a knife and had re­sisted ar­rest.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­body has seen the video. And so from their per­spec­tive, they have tried this case, at their com­puter screen or in their liv­ing room. As a pro­fes­sional, I am called upon to talk about how to try this case, in a real jury room in a real court,” Mr Gravely said.</p>
    <p>Mr Blake re­fused po­lice com­mands to drop the knife, which Mr Grav­e­ley said gave Mr Sh­eskey the right to self-de­fence. As Mr Sh­eskey made a fi­nal at­tempt to de­tain the man, Mr Blake turned and thrust the knife to­wards Mr</p>
    <p>Sh­eskey, an act blocked on the video by the car door and an­other of­fi­cer, in­ves­ti­ga­tors said.</p>
    <p>Mr Sh­eskey fired seven times un­til Mr Blake dropped the knife, a jus­ti­fied num­ber and in ac­cor­dance with po­lice train­ing, said former Madi­son po­lice chief Noble Wray, who had been named by the Wis­con­sin Depart­ment of Jus­tice to re­view the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Grav­e­ley called the in­ci­dent a tragedy for all those in­volved, es­pe­cially Mr Blake, who was paral­ysed from the waist down and shot in the pres­ence of three of his young sons. Mr Blake’s lawyers said they are con­sid­er­ing a civil law­suit against Mr Sh­eskey.</p>
    <p>The shoot­ing took place while pas­sions were in­flamed over the May 25 death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, a black man, af­ter a white Min­neapo­lis po­lice of­fi­cer knelt on his neck. Thou­sands took to the streets in “Black Lives Mat­ter” anti-racism protests in the US and around the world fol­low­ing Mr Floyd’s death amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr B’Ivory LaMarr, one of the lawyers for the Blake fam­ily, said Mr Sh­eskey should have been charged with at­tempted homi­cide, and called on peo­ple to ad­vo­cate for racial jus­tice and po­lice re­form.</p>
    <p>“The video made it clear Ja­cob... never raised a knife,” Mr LaMarr said.</p>
    <p>The shoot­ing of Mr Blake at­tracted a mix of civil rights demon­stra­tors, an­ar­chists and right-wing mili­tias to Kenosha last sum­mer.</p>
    <p>At the height of those protests, teenager Kyle Rit­ten­house opened fire with a Smith & Wes­son M&P 15 ri­fle, killing two men and wound­ing an­other.</p>
    <p>Rit­ten­house, now 18, has been charged with first-de­gree reck­less homi­cide and five other crim­i­nal counts. Ear­lier on Tues­day, he pleaded not guilty to all counts in a video ap­pear­ance in Kenosha County Cir­cuit Court.</p>
