    <p>BEI­JING • China aims to be car­bon neu­tral by 2060 – tight­en­ing its tar­get to cut green­house gases – and has sig­nalled higher spend­ing on green tech­nolo­gies in the next five years, a ma­jor pledge in the fight against cli­mate change by the world’s worst pol­luter.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, speak­ing dur­ing a vir­tual United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly on Tues­day, also re­it­er­ated his goal for emis­sions to peak be­fore 2030 and urged all na­tions to work to­wards a greener eco­nomic re­cov­ery from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While he did not lay out de­tails, Mr Xi’s an­nounce­ment im­plies that China’s emis­sions will have to sharply de­cline to reach net zero in less than 30 years af­ter peak­ing in 2030.</p>
    <p>“Hu­mankind can no longer af­ford to ig­nore the re­peated warn­ings of na­ture and go down the beaten path of ex­tract­ing re­sources with­out in­vest­ing in con­ser­va­tion, pur­su­ing de­vel­op­ment at the ex­pense of pro­tec­tion and ex­ploit­ing re­sources with­out restora­tion,” Mr Xi said in a speech by video link.</p>
    <p>The re­marks sug­gest that China, the world’s most pop­u­lous na­tion and top en­ergy user, is will­ing to take on more re­spon­si­bil­ity for tack­ling cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>It marks a con­trast with US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s de­ci­sion to</p>
    <p>pull out of the Paris Agree­ment, which called for lim­its on fos­sil fuel emis­sions ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi did not give any fur­ther de­tails on what car­bon neu­tral­ity means or set out fur­ther in­for­ma­tion about how Bei­jing’s pledges un­der the Paris ac­cord will evolve.</p>
    <p>His an­nounce­ment is ev­i­dence that the Chi­nese government’s next five-year plan will seek to ac­cel­er­ate the spread of clean en­ergy.</p>
    <p>The plan for 2021-2025, due to be pub­lished in March, will likely seek to bal­ance eco­nomic growth that has been fu­elled by coal with the need to rein in pol­lu­tants dam­ag­ing the at­mos­phere.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has been try­ing to limit the use of the dirt­i­est fos­sil fuel in re­cent years while scal­ing up re­new­able en­ergy pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, it is on track to meet its pledge for power sec­tor emis­sions to peak by 2030, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg’s re­search ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“Although de­tails are scarce at the mo­ment, this looks like a very sig­nif­i­cant step for­ward,” said Mr Richard Black, di­rec­tor of the En­ergy and Cli­mate In­tel­li­gence Unit.</p>
    <p>“China isn’t just the world’s big­gest emit­ter, but the big­gest en­ergy fi­nancier and big­gest mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Reach­ing net zero car­bon emis­sions would re­quire enor­mous in­vest­ments. By one es­ti­mate, pub­lished this week by an­a­lysts at San­ford C. Bern­stein, the na­tion would need to spend US$5.5 tril­lion (S$7.5 tril­lion), or about US$180 bil­lion an­nu­ally, to reach that goal by 2050. It would re­quire dras­ti­cally cut­ting the use of fos­sil fu­els and scal­ing up fron­tier tech­nolo­gies to off­set its re­main­ing emis­sions, in­clud­ing car­bon cap­ture.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean of­fi­cials were ex­pected to press Bei­jing to toughen its cli­mate goals at a high-level meet­ing last week, ac­cord­ing to two of­fi­cials who spoke to re­porters on the con­di­tion of anonymity.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union wanted Chi­nese green­house gas emis­sions to peak by 2025 in­stead of the coun­try’s tar­get date of 2030.</p>
    <p>The bloc also wanted the coun­try to stop build­ing coal-fired power plants at home and fi­nanc­ing them abroad, the of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>“Six years ago, the se­cret US-China cli­mate deal caught the world by a nice sur­prise,” said Mr Li Shuo, se­nior cli­mate and en­ergy pol­icy of­fi­cer at Green­peace East Asia.</p>
    <p>“Xi Jin­ping’s cli­mate pledge is a bold diplo­matic move that demon­strates clear po­lit­i­cal will and the max­i­mum de­sire to con­trast China’s cli­mate stance with the US’.”</p>
