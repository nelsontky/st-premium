    <p>NEW YORK • UW Health Univer­sity Hospi­tal in Madi­son, Wis­con­sin, has been rush­ing to con­vert avail­able space i nto units for Covid-19 pa­tients, as the state’s med­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties strug­gle to keep pace with a surge in new cases.</p>
    <p>As part of the ef­fort, the med­i­cal cen­tre opened a new in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) this week ahead of sched­ule, and it is quickly fill­ing with coro­n­avirus pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“To­day, we have more pa­tients than we’ve had ever be­fore,” said Dr Jeff Pothof, an emer­gency medicine physi­cian at UW Health.</p>
    <p>“It’s putting a strain on our ca­pac­ity. Our big­gest con­cern is ICU staffing.”</p>
    <p>Wis­con­sin, a hotly con­tested bat­tle­ground state in next week’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, is one of 36 states in the US where coro­n­avirus hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions are ris­ing by at least 10 per cent com­pared with the pre­vi­ous week, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>“We are at an­other crit­i­cal point in the pan­demic re­sponse,” Ad­mi­ral Brett Giroir, an as­sis­tant US health sec­re­tary, told NBC’s To­day show.</p>
    <p>“Cases are go­ing up in most states across the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>More than 44,000 coro­n­avirus pa­tients were in hos­pi­tals on Tues­day, the high­est num­ber since Aug 15 and up 40 per cent this month.</p>
    <p>The na­tion re­ported over 74,000 new cases on Tues­day and nearly 1,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>The largest in­crease in US hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions was in Texas, which re­ported al­most 1,000 new Covid-19 hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions on Tues­day, up 20 per cent from a week ago.</p>
    <p>With a surge in cases over­whelm­ing lo­cal hos­pi­tals, the Texas city of El Paso has con­verted a con­ven­tion cen­tre into a field hospi­tal to treat the over­flow.</p>
    <p>Twelve states i n the US set records for hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients on Tues­day: Arkansas, In­di­ana, Iowa, Ken­tucky, Min­nesota, Ne­braska, New Mex­ico, Ohio, South Dakota, West Vir­ginia, Wis­con­sin and Wy­oming.</p>
    <p>In Wis­con­sin, which broke one­day state records for cases and deaths on Tues­day, state of­fi­cials asked res­i­dents to quar­an­tine vol­un­tar­ily when pos­si­ble, wear masks and can­cel so­cial gath­er­ings with more than five peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“There’s no way to sug­ar­coat it: We are fac­ing an ur­gent cri­sis and there is an im­mi­nent risk to you, your fam­ily mem­bers, your friends, your neigh­bours and the peo­ple you care about,” Wis­con­sin Gov­er­nor Tony Evers said.</p>
    <p>De­spite the wors­en­ing pan­demic and fac­ing crit­i­cism that he is pri­ori­tis­ing his re-elec­tion above the health of his sup­port­ers, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump pushed ahead on Wed­nes­day with mass ral­lies in the fi­nal stretch of his cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence was also due to cam­paign in Wis­con­sin on Wed­nes­day af­ter mem­bers of his in­ner cir­cle tested pos­i­tive for the virus in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence him­self has tested neg­a­tive for the virus and the Trump cam­paign said it was tak­ing all nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions to en­sure safety at the event.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new Covid-19 cases in the United State­shas risen 25 per cent in the past week to nearly half a mil­lion, while the num­ber of tests per­formed rose 6 per cent, ac­cord­ing to the Reuters anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>Adm Giroir em­pha­sised that the spike can be con­trolled with mit­i­ga­tion ef­forts, in­clud­ing wear­ing masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>“If we don’t do those things, it may force lo­cal of­fi­cials and gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials in states to have more dra­co­nian mea­sures be­cause cases will go up if we don’t make a change,” he warned.</p>
