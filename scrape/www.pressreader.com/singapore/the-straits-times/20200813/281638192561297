    <p>Na­tional car­rier Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) is of­fer­ing its cabin crew early re­lease or re­tire­ment as it con­tin­ues ef­forts to cut costs amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the vol­un­tary re­tire­ment scheme was in­tro­duced in view of the im­pact of Covid-19 “as well as a slower pro­jected re­cov­ery tra­jec­tory in in­ter­na­tional air travel”.</p>
    <p>Cabin crew mem­bers who suc­cess­fully ap­ply for the scheme will get pay­outs and ben­e­fits. They will have un­til the end of the month to ap­ply. Trainee crew will not be el­i­gi­ble. The out­come of the ap­pli­ca­tions will be made known by the mid­dle of next month.</p>
    <p>“Each ap­pli­ca­tion will be con­sid­ered on its mer­its and SIA will also take into ac­count op­er­a­tional re­quire­ments in the re­view of ap­pli­ca­tions,” said a spokesman.</p>
    <p>“We con­tinue to work closely with our unions on the way for­ward where staff mea­sures are con­cerned. We will an­nounce any ad­di­tional mea­sures, if nec­es­sary, at the ap­pro­pri­ate time.”</p>
    <p>SIA has al­most 9,000 crew mem­bers. The scheme also ap­plies to its re­gional arm SilkAir, which has more than 680 crew mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an e-mail an­nounc­ing the move seen by ST, SIA said the early re­tire­ment and re­lease scheme aims to mit­i­gate the “de­bil­i­tat­ing busi­ness i mpact of Covid-19”. It said the terms and ben­e­fits have been de­ter­mined in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Staff Union.</p>
    <p>Crew mem­bers will re­ceive dif­fer­ent ben­e­fits based on their em­ploy­ment sta­tus. Three groups of crew are el­i­gi­ble – those still serv­ing their bond as of Aug 1, those in the last year of their cur­rent con­tract, and male crew on ten­ure.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a new Sin­ga­porean crew mem­ber would be bonded for 18 months af­ter join­ing SIA and would have to pay a penalty if he or she leaves be­fore the bond ends.</p>
    <p>But un­der this early re­lease and re­tire­ment scheme, a crew mem­ber who has yet to com­plete his or her bond could ap­ply to leave early and have the out­stand­ing bond re­pay­ment waived if suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>SIA will also waive any out­stand­ing set­tling-in l oan and give a no­tice pay-in-lieu, based on the ba­sic salary at the point of de­par­ture. Crew mem­bers who are still on pro­ba­tion get one month’s pay, while con­firmed crew mem­bers will get three months’ pay.</p>
    <p>Like all other air­lines, SIA has been hard hit by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The car­rier is cur­rently op­er­at­ing at just 7 per cent of its sched­uled ca­pac­ity as com­pared with be­fore the pan­demic. Some cabin crew have yet to take to the air in months.</p>
    <p>Pay cuts of at least 10 per cent and no-pay-leave schemes have been in­tro­duced.</p>
    <p>Early re­tire­ment has also been of­fered for ground staff and pi­lots.</p>
    <p>Last month, the SIA Group, which in­cludes SilkAir and bud­get car­rier Scoot, re­ported a $1.12 bil­lion net loss in the quar­ter ended June 30, its largest quar­terly loss on record.</p>
    <p>Across the group, more than 6,000 of its 27,000 staff have taken no-pay leave, while more than 1,700 em­ploy­ees have signed up for vol­un­teer po­si­tions and jobs in ex­ter­nal or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Scoot told ST yes­ter­day that it has im­ple­mented fur­ther pay cuts for all staff, ex­tended vol­un­tary no-pay leave to all em­ploy­ees and in­tro­duced a vol­un­tary sep­a­ra­tion scheme for its pi­lots this month.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ous mea­sures in­clude cut­ting back on dis­cre­tionary spend­ing wher­ever pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Air travel de­mand is ex­pected to re­main low for the fore­see­able fu­ture, with the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion say­ing it will be un­til 2024 be­fore de­mand re­turns to last year’s lev­els.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have said that the var­i­ous mea­sures, which in­clude rais­ing $11 bil­lion so far this fi­nan­cial year, will help the SIA Group – but not likely to the ex­tent that it can avoid even­tual job cuts.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic Health said the new in­fec­tions could also have been caused by a chain of asymp­to­matic or mildly symp­to­matic cases that had not been picked up.</p>
    <p>His col­league, As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Liyang, who is also an in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist, agreed.</p>
    <p>He said: “We do know that a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of in­di­vid­u­als – espe­cially chil­dren and young adults – are ei­ther asymp­to­matic or present with very mild symp­toms, but re­main in­fec­tious.”</p>
    <p>That could also be the case in Sin­ga­pore, de­spite low com­mu­nity num­bers.</p>
    <p>Prof Cook added that the virus could have slipped through the safety net if peo­ple who were quar­an­tined did not ad­here to the re­stric­tion on leav­ing home.</p>
    <p>This was how the out­break in Vic­to­ria ex­ploded. One in five peo­ple un­der quar­an­tine was not at home when checks were made.</p>
    <p>At that time, Aus­tralia had “beaten” Covid-19 and was see­ing very low num­bers – like Sin­ga­pore is start­ing to.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple let their guard down – re­sult­ing in need­less, fresh Covid-19 deaths.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist Asok Ku­rup said: “It just shows that there is al­ways a pos­si­bil­ity of a weak link some­where. Each coun­try may have its own pe­cu­liar prob­lem. We re­main vul­ner­a­ble with­out durable im­mu­nity or vac­cine.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is now at a point where the out­break seems un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Whether this happy sit­u­a­tion can be sus­tained will de­pend on the at­ti­tude and be­hav­iour of its peo­ple.</p>
    <p>As the ex­perts keep say­ing, a sec­ond wave could be even more se­vere than the first.</p>
    <p>Said Prof Hsu: “We still need to be careful and main­tain good hy­giene as well as safe dis­tanc­ing as far as pos­si­ble, even though the num­ber of cases has fallen in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>One must also re­mem­ber how a hand­ful of vis­i­tors from China brought Covid-19 to Sin­ga­pore. In just over half a year, more than 55,000 peo­ple here have been in­fected and 27 have died.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, it took only a few in­fected peo­ple in Wuhan to cause a pan­demic that is still caus­ing thou­sands of deaths ev­ery sin­gle day.</p>
    <p>It would be naive to imag­ine that Sin­ga­pore is now safe.</p>
    <p>Its only de­fences are its peo­ple work­ing to­gether to keep trans­mis­sion low, the Govern­ment mov­ing in quickly to con­tain new cases, and a health­care sys­tem that can give each pa­tient the best care pos­si­ble – but only if the num­bers re­main man­age­able.</p>
    <p>As Prof Wang said, the ex­pe­ri­ences of other coun­tries “re­mind us again that no place is safe un­til the whole world is safe”.</p>
