    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish ac­tor John Boyega (left) has crit­i­cised the treat­ment of non-white char­ac­ters in the lat­est Star Wars films, say­ing they were mar­keted as im­por­tant el­e­ments of the fran­chise but were ul­ti­mately “pushed to the side”.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view pub­lished by GQ mag­a­zine on Wed­nes­day, Boyega ex­pressed bit­ter­ness at how his role as black stormtroop­er Finn faded in later episodes of the tril­ogy, which con­cluded with The Rise Of</p>
    <p>Sky­walker last year.</p>
    <p>“What I would say to Dis­ney is do not bring out a black char­ac­ter, mar­ket them to be much more im­por­tant in the fran­chise than they are and then have them pushed to the side.</p>
    <p>“It’s not good. I’ll say it straight up,” he told the mag­a­zine.</p>
    <p>Boyega said his fel­low non-white ac­tors Naomi Ackie, Kelly Marie Tran and Os­car Isaac had suf­fered sim­i­lar fates, while Adam Driver and Daisy Ri­d­ley took the spotlight in the lead roles as Kylo Ren and Rey.</p>
    <p>“They gave all the nu­ance to Adam Driver, all the nu­ance to Daisy Ri­d­ley. Let’s be hon­est. Daisy knows this. Adam knows this. Ev­ery­body knows. I’m not ex­pos­ing any­thing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Boyega, who is of Nige­rian de­scent, be­came a vi­ral sen­sa­tion in June when he gave an emo­tional speech at an anti-racism demon­stra­tion in Lon­don fol­low­ing the death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, an un­armed black man, at the hands of Amer­i­can po­lice in Min­neapo­lis.</p>
    <p>“I’m the only cast mem­ber who had his own unique ex­pe­ri­ence of that fran­chise based on his race,” Boyega said of Star Wars.</p>
    <p>“Let’s just leave it like that. It makes you an­gry with a process like that. It makes you much more mil­i­tant; it changes you.”</p>
