    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said in an in­ter­view that a plane l oaded with “thugs” was headed for the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion last week “to do big dam­age”. He pro­vided few de­tails.</p>
    <p>The con­ven­tion con­cluded last Thurs­day night with Mr Trump’s nom­i­na­tion ac­cep­tance speech on the South Lawn of the White House, and he has com­plained fre­quently since then about pro­test­ers who ac­costed au­di­ence mem­bers as they left.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump made the claim about the plane of “thugs” in an in­ter­view on Mon­day with Fox News host Laura In­gra­ham, who asked him who he thought was con­trol­ling Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple you’ve never heard of.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple that are in the dark shad­ows,” Mr Trump re­sponded.</p>
    <p>Ms In­gra­ham said his re­sponse sounded like a con­spir­acy the­ory.</p>
    <p>“No, peo­ple you haven’t heard of,” Mr Trump con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>“We had some­body get on a plane from a cer­tain city this week­end, and in the plane it was al­most com­pletely loaded with thugs wear­ing these dark uni­forms, black uni­forms with gear and this and that. They’re on a plane.”</p>
    <p>Ms In­gra­ham asked him where they were com­ing from.</p>
    <p>“I’ll tell you some time but it’s un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion right now,” Mr Trump said. “But they came from a cer­tain city, and this per­son was com­ing to the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion and there were like, seven peo­ple on the plane like this per­son, and then a lot of peo­ple were on the plane to do big dam­age. They were com­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ms In­gra­ham asked if they were headed for Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>“This was all, this was all hap­pen­ing,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>Ms In­gra­ham asked where they were get­ting their money from.</p>
    <p>“The money is com­ing from some very stupid rich peo­ple that have no idea that if their thing ever suc­ceeded, which it won’t, they will be thrown to the wolves like you’ve never seen be­fore,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Bi­den has ac­cused Pres­i­dent Trump of stok­ing vi­o­lence af­ter a week of deadly un­rest cat­a­pulted law and or­der to the top of the po­lit­i­cal agenda, barely two months be­fore the US elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The stakes for Mr Bi­den’s speech in Pittsburgh on Mon­day, in the swing state of Penn­syl­va­nia, could not have been higher a day be­fore Mr Trump heads to the city of Kenosha, Wis­con­sin, to de­liver his du­elling vi­sion on the up­heaval.</p>
    <p>Emerg­ing from months of Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions, Mr Bi­den finds him­self sud­denly on the de­fen­sive, mocked by Mr Trump as weak in the face of events com­bin­ing left­ist anti-racism protests, ri­ots, deadly shoot­ings and right-wing vig­i­lante ac­tions in Kenosha and in Port­land, Ore­gon.</p>
    <p>With Mr Trump ex­alt­ing in the shift of de­bate from his widely panned han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic to his favoured theme of crime, Mr Bi­den risks los­ing the mo­men­tum that has put him ahead in the polls for the Nov 3 vote.</p>
    <p>But the 77-year-old Demo­crat punched back, brand­ing Mr Trump’s pres­i­dency “a toxic pres­ence in our na­tion”.</p>
    <p>“Fires are burn­ing and we have a pres­i­dent who fans the flames rather than fight­ing the flames,” Mr Bi­den said. “The in­cum­bent pres­i­dent is in­ca­pable of telling us the truth, in­ca­pable of fac­ing the facts and in­ca­pable of heal­ing.”</p>
    <p>The Demo­crat sought to turn ta­bles on the Repub­li­can in his 22-minute speech – de­liv­ered in a mostly empty hall due to coro­n­avirus con­cerns – with the ques­tion: “Do you re­ally feel safer un­der Don­ald Trump?”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump “can’t stop the vi­o­lence, be­cause for years he has fo­mented it,” Mr Bi­den charged.</p>
