    <p>It has been more than a month since Sin­ga­pore re­turned the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party to power, although with a lower vote share. To­mor­row, in her ad­dress to Par­lia­ment, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob will set out the Gov­ern­ment’s pri­or­i­ties and plans for its next term. This, along with the sub­se­quent de­bate, will be more closely watched than ever, given Covid-19 and its bruis­ing im­pact on the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>What can Sin­ga­pore­ans ex­pect go­ing for­ward? First, some im­me­di­ate changes: fresh faces.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, the PAP an­nounced that Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah will be the new Leader of the House, re­plac­ing Ms Grace Fu, with Se­nior Min­is­ter of State Zaqy Mo­hamad as her deputy, tak­ing over from Mr Des­mond Lee.</p>
    <p>Nine of the 12 newly formed gov­ern­ment par­lia­men­tary com­mit­tees have new chair­men, in­clud­ing MacPher­son MP Tin Pei Ling who takes over from Mr Cedric Foo, who re­tired from pol­i­tics, to head Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>For the PAP’s new faces, press­ing is­sues are jobs and busi­nesses. Oth­ers plan to speak on top­ics such as so­cial mo­bil­ity – the sub­ject of much de­bate re­cently.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers will also watch for any change in dy­namic be­tween the PAP and mem­bers of the op­po­si­tion, given that Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh is for­mally Leader of the Op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The PAP’s 61.2 per cent vote share has also been taken by some as a sign vot­ers want more fun­da­men­tal change, es­pe­cially in its ap­proach to gov­er­nance and dom­i­nance in Par­lia­ment. Will this hap­pen, and what could it look like?</p>
    <p>THE PAP’S NEXT STEPS</p>
    <p>Dur­ing last month’s cer­e­mony to swear in the new Cab­i­net, Prime</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal sys­tem must evolve to ac­com­mo­date the greater di­ver­sity of views in pol­i­tics, even as it main­tains co­he­sion and a sense of na­tional pur­pose.</p>
    <p>His con­clu­sion was not dis­sim­i­lar to the ones drawn by the party after the 2011 Gen­eral Elec­tion, when it lost a GRC for the first time.</p>
    <p>So will the PAP’s re­sponse this time be sim­i­lar to that in 2011?</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say that the an­swer lies in the po­lit­i­cal will of the PAP’s fourth­gen­er­a­tion lead­er­ship whether to forge a new way for­ward.</p>
    <p>Says Mr Leonard Lim, coun­try di­rec­tor at con­sul­tancy firm Vriens & Part­ners: “The desire among a grow­ing pro­por­tion of cit­i­zens for fair play and gra­cious­ness in the po­lit­i­cal arena may res­onate with some of these younger lead­ers.</p>
    <p>“If a crit­i­cal mass, es­pe­cially the more in­flu­en­tial among the 4G, voices con­cerns about the party’s di­rec­tion given the ma­tur­ing elec­torate, there could be shifts in how the PAP ap­proaches sen­si­tive top­ics.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser says Mr Singh’s ap­point­ment is sig­nif­i­cant. “I be­lieve it sig­nals that the PAP sees the op­po­si­tion as hav­ing es­tab­lished a more per­ma­nent pres­ence, and the pos­si­ble emer­gence of a two-party sys­tem down the road,” he adds.</p>
    <p>As Op­po­si­tion Leader, the Work­ers’ Party chief will get con­fi­den­tial brief­ings on na­tional se­cu­rity and ex­ter­nal re­la­tions and, among other things, re­ceive dou­ble the al­lowance of an elected MP, with a pack­age of $385,000 a year.</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute of Policy Stud­ies deputy di­rec­tor of re­search Gil­lian Koh says Mr Singh’s ap­point­ment in­di­cates a change in the PAP’s at­ti­tude. “The op­po­si­tion is not a black mark to be scrubbed out, but a fea­ture of the po­lit­i­cal land­scape that the PAP needs to en­gage with.</p>
    <p>“The move is meant to sig­nal to Sin­ga­pore­ans that the party is pre­pared to work with the op­po­si­tion in a new model of gov­ern­ing Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Au­thor and coun­try brand ad­viser Koh Buck Song says the best sce­nario in a ma­tur­ing democ­racy is for the rul­ing party to be­come more open to rel­e­vant cri­tiques and counter-pro­pos­als from any­one – as well as to part­ner with them – re­gard­less of party af­fil­i­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Another take comes from Mr Har­ri­son Cheng, as­so­ciate di­rec­tor at con­sul­tancy firm Con­trol Risks, who notes that the pub­lic must also be will­ing to par­tic­i­pate and shape the pol­i­tics they want to see.</p>
    <p>“That means read­ing up on im­por­tant is­sues, un­der­stand­ing dif­fer­ent view­points, ex­er­cis­ing their civil and demo­cratic rights,” he says. “Not only on Polling Day, but reg­u­larly writ­ing let­ters to MPs, mak­ing their views and con­cerns known, (and) tak­ing part in pub­lic con­sul­ta­tions.”</p>
    <p>Dr Felix Tan, an as­so­ciate lec­turer at SIM Global Ed­u­ca­tion, also notes how the PAP Women’s Wing last month said it was “dis­mayed” by a sen­tence “dis­pro­por­tion­ate to the of­fence” for a den­tistry stu­dent who tried to stran­gle his former girl­friend.</p>
    <p>This was un­usual and could have been a re­sponse to a chang­ing so­cial land­scape, he says. “Sin­ga­pore­ans no longer want to be just pas­sive view­ers... More want to be en­gaged in some so­cial cause to im­prove Sin­ga­pore as a whole.”</p>
    <p>THE OP­PO­SI­TION FRONT</p>
    <p>Ob­servers say one fac­tor that worked in the op­po­si­tion par­ties’ favour in GE2020 was the sug­ges­tion by WP’s Mr Singh that they could be wiped out, and the PAP was seek­ing a “blank cheque” from the elec­torate.</p>
    <p>The ob­servers be­lieve the claim was bol­stered by the fact that former WP chief Low Thia Khi­ang, and to a lesser ex­tent Mr Chen Show Mao and Mr Png Eng Huat, had stepped down from the WP slate.</p>
    <p>That cre­ated the same un­cer­tainty about the con­tin­ued pres­ence of op­po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment that emerged in 2011 when Mr Low left his strong­hold of Hougang and op­po­si­tion stal­wart Chiam See Tong ven­tured out of Po­tong Pasir.</p>
    <p>That year, Mr Low led his WP team to a his­toric vic­tory in Alju­nied GRC, though Mr Chiam fell short in Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC.</p>
    <p>In 2015, WP in­sid­ers said the party had over­es­ti­mated the elec­torate’s ap­petite for change.</p>
    <p>This year, chas­tened by its 2015 ex­pe­ri­ence, the WP con­tested fewer con­stituen­cies and also ran a low-key cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Dr Lam Peng Er of the East Asia In­sti­tute says the WP pitched its cam­paign just right.</p>
    <p>In an elec­tion where many par­ties ap­peared to be con­sol­i­dat­ing, the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP) – on its first out­ing – seemed out to make a state­ment. It an­nounced early on that it in­tended to con­test 44 seats, nearly half of the 93 avail­able, be­fore whit­tling this down to 24 – still the most seats con­tested by any op­po­si­tion party.</p>
    <p>In the GE af­ter­math, an­a­lysts say the party was likely to have had a part to play in the bet­ter per­for­mance of the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The PSP had cap­i­talised on the star power of former PAP MP and one-time pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Tan Cheng Bock, 80. But that the party is syn­ony­mous with its leader has also stunted de­vel­op­ment of its own brand, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>The oc­to­ge­nar­ian’s likely re­tire­ment by the next elec­tion also makes lead­er­ship re­newal an ur­gent task for the year-old party. Ms</p>
    <p>Hazel Poa, 49, and Mr Leong Mun Wai, 60, will be the party’s two Non-Con­stituency MPs in Par­lia­ment, giv­ing them a chance to build up their pro­file.</p>
    <p>Dr Lam says whether the party will last be­yond a few turns of the elec­toral cy­cle will hinge on how suc­cess­ful it is in mov­ing away from the “cult” of Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>“Can any­one in PSP fill Dr Tan’s shoes right now? The an­swer is no. And the party has no grav­i­tas with­out Dr Tan Cheng Bock.”</p>
    <p>The WP will no doubt hope for that party to suc­ceed. Ob­servers say the PSP, which con­tested con­stituen­cies in the west side of the is­land, had lim­ited the PAP’s op­tions in mov­ing its can­di­dates around, ben­e­fit­ing the WP.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party (SDP), though, was rel­e­gated to third place with the PSP around.</p>
    <p>De­spite the re­spectable per­for­mance of party lead­ers Chee Soon Juan and Paul Tam­byah, who got 45.2 per cent and 46.27 per cent of votes in Bukit Ba­tok and Bukit Pan­jang SMCs re­spec­tively, the party did not get any par­lia­men­tary seats.</p>
    <p>But it is the first time that Dr Chee’s vote has gone above 40 per cent, and this could mean that his ef­forts to shed his com­bat­ive style since his re­turn to elec­toral pol­i­tics in 2015 are start­ing to pay off.</p>
    <p>With two big play­ers in the scene, smaller par­ties may find them­selves mus­cled out. It will be­come harder to at­tract mem­bers, vol­un­teers and even funds.</p>
    <p>Says Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity law don and former Nom­i­nate MP Eu­gene Tan: “The land­scape is chang­ing and a big chal­lenge now for many of these par­ties is find­ing rel­e­vance.”</p>
    <p>He thinks there will be more con­sol­i­da­tion in the in­ter­ven­ing years, with par­ties per­haps form­ing al­liances.</p>
    <p>For many op­po­si­tion in­sid­ers, the mo­men­tum that fol­lowed this year’s elec­tion is wel­come, but also fa­mil­iar. What was her­alded as a new nor­mal after the 2011 elec­tion – with the WP as­cen­dant – failed to man­i­fest it­self just four years later. Sim­i­larly, the SDP was touted as most likely to emerge as the main op­po­si­tion party here in the 1990s, only to floun­der on in­ter­nal dis­putes.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, an­a­lysts reckon that it is too soon to say if any­thing has fun­da­men­tally changed about the way vot­ers ap­proach the pol­i­tics here, both with re­gard to the rul­ing and op­po­si­tion par­ties.</p>
    <p>As po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Derek da Cunha noted on Face­book, the num­bers have not changed all that much in three elec­tions. Us­ing a quan­ti­ta­tive anal­y­sis ap­proach, he says, “in the same way that when in 2011 I de­duced that the ‘ir­re­duc­ible core of anti-PAP vot­ers’ was around 25 per cent of the elec­torate, there is noth­ing from the cur­rent elec­tion sta­tis­tics that prompts me to change that”.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic must also be will­ing to par­tic­i­pate and shape the pol­i­tics they want to see, said Mr Har­ri­son Cheng, as­so­ciate di­rec­tor at con­sul­tancy firm Con­trol Risks. “That means read­ing up on im­por­tant is­sues, un­der­stand­ing dif­fer­ent view­points, ex­er­cis­ing their civil and demo­cratic rights. Not only on Polling Day, but reg­u­larly writ­ing let­ters to MPs, mak­ing their views and con­cerns known, tak­ing part in pub­lic con­sul­ta­tions and so on.”</p>
