    <p>PARIS • Could the ghosts of your pre­vi­ous colds help pro­tect you from Covid-19, even if you have never been in­fected by the new coro­n­avirus?</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists are in­ves­ti­gat­ing a poorly un­der­stood im­mune mech­a­nism in the body that they hope could help ef­forts to curb the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, peo­ple who think they have had the virus might get a sero­log­i­cal test to check for an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>These pro­teins help fight off in­fec­tion and may pre­vent them from get­ting the dis­ease again in the fu­ture – but there are signs that with Covid-19 they could fade away within weeks.</p>
    <p>This leaves the other in­stru­ment in the body’s tool­kit, T lym­pho­cytes – a type of white blood cell re­spon­si­ble for the sec­ond part of the im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>With lit­tle yet known about how they op­er­ate against Covid-19, sci­en­tists are rac­ing to fill in the gaps in our knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>One hy­poth­e­sis is that these T cells might help give peo­ple a level of cross-im­mu­nity pro­tec­tion from Covid-19 be­cause they “re­mem­ber” pre­vi­ous in­fec­tions by other viruses in the same fam­ily, four of which cause com­mon colds.</p>
    <p>“The im­mune sys­tem is com­plex,” said Pro­fes­sor An­dreas Thiel, who co-au­thored a study that looked at the pres­ence of T cells able to re­act to the new coro­n­avirus, both among those with con­firmed in­fec­tions and healthy peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The re­search, pub­lished in the past week in the jour­nal Na­ture, found that at least a third of adults who had never had Covid-19 have these T cells.</p>
    <p>“These most likely orig­i­nate from pre­vi­ous in­fec­tions with en­demic coron­aviruses,” Prof Thiel, from the Ber­lin-Bran­den­burg Cen­tre for Re­gen­er­a­tive Ther­a­pies, told AFP.</p>
    <p>But he cau­tioned that much more re­search was needed to find out whether their pres­ence would nec­es­sar­ily mean im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The re­search fol­lowed a study by a team in Sin­ga­pore pub­lished in Na­ture ear­lier last month that reached a sim­i­lar con­clu­sion. An­other study from the United States, pub­lished on Tues­day in the jour­nal Sci­ence, found a num­ber of T cells that re­acted both to the new virus, Sars-CoV-2, as well as to the coron­aviruses that cause colds.</p>
    <p>“This could help ex­plain why some peo­ple show milder symp­toms of dis­ease while oth­ers get se­verely sick,” said co-au­thor Daniela Weiskopf, of La Jolla In­sti­tute for Im­munol­ogy, in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>This study builds on re­search, pub­lished in the jour­nal Cell in May by the same team, which de­tected these Sars-CoV-2 re­act­ing T cells in 40 to 60 per cent of peo­ple who had never had Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The vac­cines cur­rently in devel­op­ment for the new coro­n­avirus seek to trig­ger both types of im­mune re­sponse. How­ever, at­ten­tion had in the past largely fo­cused on the im­mu­nity con­ferred by an­ti­bod­ies</p>
    <p>“But we must not think that noth­ing else ex­ists,” Prof Yonathan Fre­und, an emer­gency medicine ex­pert at the Paris Pi­tieSalpetr­iere hospi­tal, told AFP.</p>
