    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>

    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing flirty, so have fun and show oth­ers a good time. If any­one starts to take it too se­ri­ously, you may want to let up.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Ap­ply your­self to fin­ish­ing stuff up and you can­not go wrong. Once you are done, you need not deal with it any longer.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>

    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22) Com­mu­ni­ca­tion is hard and oth­ers may mis­un­der­stand you. Choose your words care­fully and you should be okay, though it could get hairy.</p>

    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) Peo­ple talk more than they do and you need to let them know you want to see ac­tion. It is a good time to lead by ex­am­ple, so get busy.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Get rid of some­thing that is hold­ing you back. Your en­ergy needs space and you should find it eas­ier to work with less clut­ter.</p>
