    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Ap­ple and Ama­zon.com have sus­pended Par­ler from their re­spec­tive App Store and web host­ing ser­vice, say­ing the so­cial net­work­ing ser­vice that many right-lean­ing so­cial me­dia users have flocked to has not taken ad­e­quate mea­sures to pre­vent the spread of posts in­cit­ing vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>The ac­tion by Ap­ple and Ama­zon fol­lows a sim­i­lar move by Al­pha­bet’s Google on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Par­ler is favoured by many sup­port­ers of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who was per­ma­nently sus­pended from Twit­ter on Fri­day, and it is seen as a haven for peo­ple ex­pelled from Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“We have sus­pended Par­ler from the App Store un­til they re­solve these is­sues,” Ap­ple said in a state­ment on Satur­day. Ap­ple had given the ser­vice 24 hours to sub­mit a de­tailed mod­er­a­tion plan, point­ing to par­tic­i­pants’ us­ing the ser­vice to co­or­di­nate last Wed­nes­day’s siege of the US Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon sus­pended Par­ler from its Ama­zon Web Ser­vices (AWS) unit, for vi­o­lat­ing AWS’ terms of ser­vices by fail­ing to ef­fec­tively deal with a steady in­crease in vi­o­lent con­tent, ac­cord­ing to an email by an AWS trust and safety team to Par­ler, seen by Reuters. An Ama­zon spokesman con­firmed the let­ter was au­then­tic.</p>
    <p>Due to the “very real risk to public safety” that Par­ler poses, AWS planned to sus­pend Par­ler’s ac­count ef­fec­tive at 11.59pm PST yes­ter­day (3.59pm to­day Sin­ga­pore time), the e-mail seen by Reuters showed.</p>
    <p>Par­ler chief ex­ec­u­tive John Matze lashed out at Ama­zon, Google and Ap­ple, say­ing it was a co­or­di­nated ef­fort know­ing Par­ler’s op­tions would be lim­ited and it would in­flict the most dam­age right as Mr Trump was banned from other so­cial me­dia plat­forms.</p>
    <p>“There is the pos­si­bil­ity Par­ler will be un­avail­able on In­ter­net for up to a week as we re­build from scratch,” he said in a post on Par­ler. “This was a co­or­di­nated at­tack by the tech gi­ants to kill com­pe­ti­tion in the mar­ket­place... You can ex­pect the war on com­pe­ti­tion and free speech to con­tinue, but don’t count us out.”</p>
    <p>Right-lean­ing so­cial me­dia users in the US have flocked to Par­ler, mes­sag­ing app Tele­gram and so­cial site Gab, cit­ing the more ag­gres­sive polic­ing of po­lit­i­cal com­ments on main­stream plat­forms.</p>
