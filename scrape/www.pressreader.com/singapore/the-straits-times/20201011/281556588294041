    <p>MAR­RY­ING EX­PE­RI­ENCE AND LEARN­ING</p>
    <p>The course did teach some fun­da­men­tals that I was al­ready fa­mil­iar with, but it was fruit­ful to go back to school to learn new things like mu­sic pro­duc­tion and song­writ­ing... I wanted to marry my ex­pe­ri­ence in in­dus­try with new skills in school, and so­lid­ify my cre­den­tials. Many peo­ple can per­form but we don’t know how good they are the­o­ret­i­cally when they teach.</p>
    <p>LO­CAL DRUM­MER AND PER­CUS­SION­IST VICKNES VI­NAYAK VEERAPPAN, who took up a bach­e­lor’s de­gree in mu­sic at Lasalle so he could pos­si­bly be a full-time mu­sic teacher in a pri­mary or sec­ondary school.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal mu­si­cians have spo­ken up strongly for their peers who are un­able to se­cure teach­ing po­si­tions in in­sti­tu­tions in Sin­ga­pore de­spite their tal­ent – be­cause they do not hold de­grees.</p>
    <p>While some said there is value in teach­ing cre­den­tials, oth­ers noted that the skills and ex­per­tise gained as a prac­ti­tioner should be equally recog­nised.</p>
    <p>The dis­cus­sion was sparked by a Face­book post on Oct 3 by home­grown jazz stal­wart Jeremy Mon­teiro, 60, who raised the sub­ject. His post was shared nearly 800 times and gar­nered more than 1,300 re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>He cited a case of a Sin­ga­porean vi­o­lin­ist who has played in the first chair in a pres­ti­gious US sym­phony or­ches­tra for years and lec­tured in top US in­sti­tu­tions, but is un­able to land a job as a professor in a lo­cal mu­sic in­sti­tu­tion of higher learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Mon­teiro, whose pro­fes­sional mu­sic ca­reer started in 1976, was con­ferred Sin­ga­pore’s high­est arts prize, the Cul­tural Medal­lion, in 2002. He has also been a vis­it­ing professor at Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts and Univer­sity of West Lon­don’s Lon­don Col­lege Of Mu­sic, since 2006 and 2016 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted, he said he felt that it would be a waste if lo­cal mu­si­cians, who have years of ex­pe­ri­ence in the in­dus­try but no aca­demic qual­i­fi­ca­tions, are not al­lowed to for­mally teach part-time or full-time.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve our Govern­ment has been think­ing about this, in line with pre­vi­ous speeches about of­fer­ing peo­ple with­out de­grees job op­por­tu­ni­ties on the same level as grad­u­ates,” he said, re­fer­ring to pre­vi­ous re­marks by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>Mu­si­cian Mo­hamed Noor, 53, one of Sin­ga­pore’s most ac­com­plished per­cus­sion­ists, said he used to be a part-time lec­turer at Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts about 15 years ago.</p>
    <p>But he was asked to leave af­ter a change in lead­er­ship a few years later, and was told he needed at least a diploma in mu­sic, which he did not have.</p>
    <p>“When I was younger, I did want to fur­ther my stud­ies in mu­sic but couldn’t af­ford it... so I pur­sued my pas­sion in the in­dus­try,” said the vet­eran, who has toured world­wide with Hong Kong Heav­enly King Jacky Che­ung and done record­ings with Tai­wanese stars A-Mei and Wang Lee­hom.</p>
    <p>“It feels like there’s so much we can share, es­pe­cially hav­ing gone through cer­tain ex­pe­ri­ences you can’t gain from aca­demic stud­ies... but most in­sti­tu­tions, even pri­vate mu­sic schools, re­quire some qual­i­fi­ca­tions.”</p>
    <p>He added: “I could go and get a diploma now in two years but it doesn’t make sense at my age. I’ve learnt to ac­cept that times have changed and it’s more about aca­demics now.”</p>
    <p>Mr Mon­teiro said he is not against aca­demic qual­i­fi­ca­tions, which can be use­ful in the teach­ing of the arts. “Some­one who’s for­mally trained may likely be bet­ter in ar­tic­u­lat­ing mu­sic the­ory than some­one who learnt all this through the school of hard knocks or trial and er­ror.”</p>
    <p>But lo­cal in­sti­tu­tions, he added, should also recog­nise the ben­e­fits that prac­ti­tion­ers can bring to mu­sic ed­u­ca­tion, and be more proac­tive in reach­ing out to them. “There should not be any dis­tinc­tion be­tween the prac­tice, or vo­ca­tional, and academia tracks of learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>It would be fair that mu­si­cians who want to teach get some teacher train­ing, to know if they are suit­able, he said.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal drum­mer and per­cus­sion­ist Vicknes Vi­nayak Veerappan, 46,</p>
    <p>FO­CUS IS ON ACA­DEMICS</p>
    <p>It feels like there’s so much we can share, es­pe­cially hav­ing gone through cer­tain ex­pe­ri­ences you can’t gain from aca­demic stud­ies... but most in­sti­tu­tions, even pri­vate mu­sic schools, re­quire some qual­i­fi­ca­tions... I could go and get a diploma now in two years, but it doesn’t make sense at my age. I’ve learnt to ac­cept that times have changed and it’s more about aca­demics now.</p>
    <p>MU­SI­CIAN MO­HAMED NOOR, one of Sin­ga­pore’s most ac­com­plished per­cus­sion­ists.</p>
    <p>took up a bach­e­lor’s de­gree in mu­sic at Lasalle in 2018 so he could pos­si­bly be a full-time mu­sic teacher in a pri­mary or sec­ondary school.</p>
    <p>“The course did teach some fun­da­men­tals that I was al­ready fa­mil­iar with, but it was fruit­ful to go back to school to learn new things like mu­sic pro­duc­tion and song­writ­ing,” said the mu­si­cian who has per­formed in mu­si­cals such as For­bid­den City: Por­trait Of An Em­press and Dim Sum Dol­lies.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to marry my ex­pe­ri­ence in in­dus­try with new skills in school, and so­lid­ify my cre­den­tials. Many peo­ple can per­form but we don’t know how good they are the­o­ret­i­cally when they teach.”</p>
    <p>Lo­cal in­sti­tu­tions said they value aca­demic cre­den­tials. How­ever, some are less strict on such cri­te­ria, with in­dus­try ex­pe­ri­ence also play­ing a role in se­lec­tion pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) said fac­ulty mem­bers at its Yong Siew Toh Con­ser­va­tory of Mu­sic are “ap­pro­pri­ately qual­i­fied”. NUS “places a high value on... pro­fes­sional artis­tic ca­pac­ity, re­search ca­pac­i­ties and out­put, as well as teach­ing qual­i­fi­ca­tions and ex­pe­ri­ence”.</p>
    <p>For mu­sic, like other fields taught at the ter­tiary level, a de­gree is “widely recog­nised as the min­i­mum qual­i­fi­ca­tion for a univer­sity teach­ing ap­point­ment, with most ap­pointable fac­ulty in the con­tem­po­rary world now re­quir­ing post­grad­u­ate qual­i­fi­ca­tions”, added the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa) said both proven track records of teach­ing and in­dus­try ex­pe­ri­ence are im­por­tant cri­te­ria for se­lec­tion. “In­dus­try ex­pe­ri­ence can also be con­sid­ered as an equiv­a­lent to the min­i­mum ed­u­ca­tional qual­i­fi­ca­tions for teach­ing diploma and de­gree cour­ses,” it said.</p>
    <p>Nafa, which of­fers cour­ses in ar­eas like mu­sic as well as art and de­sign, added that it em­ploys 96 full­time and ad­junct aca­demic staff who do not hold de­grees, of whom 16 teach at its school of mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Lasalle said it “re­quires (mu­sic) ed­u­ca­tors to have qual­i­fi­ca­tions higher than the course or mod­ule or sub­ject they teach” as the cur­ricu­lum has a strong bal­ance of the­ory, prac­tice and con­tex­tual stud­ies.</p>
    <p>Dr Venka Pu­rushothama­n, the col­lege’s provost, said there are rig­or­ous merit-based hir­ing stan­dards, but if the best can­di­date does not meet the qual­i­fi­ca­tion re­quire­ment, fac­tors such as pro­fes­sional ex­per­tise or rel­e­vant work­ing ex­pe­ri­ence will be taken into ac­count.</p>
    <p>He noted that the col­lege does hire non-de­gree hold­ers with “sub­stan­tive ex­per­tise” to teach spe­cific mod­ules and classes such as vo­cal tech­nique or in­stru­ment.</p>
    <p>Lasalle grad­u­ate Eshan Denip­i­tiya, who did a Bach­e­lor of Arts in mu­sic, said he had men­tors who did not have for­mal qual­i­fi­ca­tions. One of them is his fa­ther Ma­hesh, who is a di­rec­tor and com­poser in their home coun­try Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p>Mr Denip­i­tiya, 25, who works in mu­sic school Aureus Academy, said: “His unique years of ex­pe­ri­ence and abil­ity to im­part knowl­edge to oth­ers is far more valu­able than any pa­per qual­i­fi­ca­tion.”</p>
