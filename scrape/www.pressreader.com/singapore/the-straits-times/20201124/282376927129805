    <p>League games un­beaten at home for Liver­pool, a club record, putting them 22 be­hind Chelsea’s top-flight best.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Jur­gen Klopp hailed Liver­pool’s re­sponse to an in­jury cri­sis that left him with­out eight first­team reg­u­lars, as a dom­i­nant 3-0 win over Le­ices­ter moved the English cham­pi­ons level on points with Premier League lead­ers Tot­ten­ham.</p>
    <p>The Reds man­ager was with­out Vir­gil van Dijk, Joe Gomez, Trent Alexan­der-Arnold, Jor­dan Hen­der­son, Thi­ago Al­can­tara, Xher­dan Shaqiri and Alex Oxlade-Cham­ber­lain through in­jury, while top scorer Mo­hamed Salah was ab­sent due to a pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus test.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the hosts swept aside a Le­ices­ter team who had started the week­end on top of the ta­ble to set a club record of 64 league games un­beaten at An­field since April 2017.</p>
    <p>“Very (sat­is­fy­ing), be­cause we de­served it 100 per cent,” said Klopp. “The boys played an in­cred­i­ble game against a top op­po­nent.</p>
    <p>“Play­ing them like that tonight, I do not take for granted. The boys were on fire.”</p>
    <p>James Mil­ner again proved his worth as a util­ity man, fill­ing in at right-back and later in mid­field af­ter Naby Keita went off with an in­jury in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old also made two goals from corners, in­clud­ing one that led to de­fender Jonny Evans’ own goal and for Roberto Firmino to head home the third.</p>
    <p>Sand­wiched be­tween was Diogo Jota’s strike, with the Por­tu­gal for­ward be­com­ing the first Liver­pool player to score in his first four home league games.</p>
    <p>The hosts could have had more as Ul­ster­man Evans al­most scored an­other own goal and Firmino hit the post, while Kasper Schmeichel kept the score down, mak­ing smart saves from Sa­dio Mane and Jota.</p>
    <p>Brazil for­ward Firmino even­tu­ally net­ted his third league goal in 24 games and al­though his re­cent tally has not been pro­lific, his in­dus­tri­ous dis­play at An­field high­lighted what he brings to the team.</p>
    <p>On calls for him to be dropped for Jota when Salah re­turns, Klopp, who re­vealed af­ter­wards the Egypt for­ward would re­turn to train­ing this week as he had tested neg­a­tive, said: “What people say about him is ridicu­lous. You can­not be closer to the goal than he was tonight. It was ex­actly the right goalscorer. We were so happy for him, he played out­stand­ing tonight.”</p>
    <p>An­other mus­cle in­jury suf­fered by Keita was the only neg­a­tive for Klopp, on a night when his side showed they will not give up their ti­tle eas­ily de­spite los­ing cen­tre­backs van Dijk and Gomez for most of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man trained his sights on broad­cast­ers Sky and BT, blast­ing the match sched­ul­ing he be­lieves is ex­ac­er­bat­ing the in­jury cri­sis at his club.</p>
    <p>On why he waited till the 89th minute to make changes, he said: “Why we change late is be­cause we con­stantly have to think that some­body will go down with an in­jury. We can­not change early, be­cause we change early and the other one has an in­jury, and you end the game with nine play­ers.</p>
    <p>“If you (Sky) don’t start talk­ing to BT, we’re done. If we keep play­ing on Wed­nes­day and Saturday at 12.30pm, I’m not sure if you’ll fin­ish the sea­son with 11 play­ers.</p>
    <p>“All the top six are the same, but I know you (the broad­cast­ers) don’t care and that’s the prob­lem.”</p>
