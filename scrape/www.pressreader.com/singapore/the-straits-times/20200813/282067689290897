    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) and the Te­masek Foun­da­tion will help trans­port es­sen­tial med­i­cal sup­plies and other hu­man­i­tar­ian items by air to points of need around the world, in a new part­ner­ship with the World Food Pro­gramme (WFP).</p>
    <p>The Rome-based WFP is the United Na­tions’ food as­sis­tance branch, and pro­vides the lo­gis­tics back­bone for global Covid-19 ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Op­er­at­ing a net­work of hubs as well as pas­sen­ger and cargo air links, the WFP en­sures the steady flow of sup­plies and sup­port to pan­demic front lines as part of a Covid-19 re­sponse known as WFP Com­mon Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Since May, the agency has man­aged more than 800 hu­man­i­tar­ian flights to 159 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Tues­day, Mr Amer Daoudi, the WFP’s Covid-19 cor­po­rate re­sponse di­rec­tor, said: “While de­mand for WFP Com­mon Ser­vices grows ev­ery week, re­sources are stretched in­cred­i­bly thin and ad­di­tional sup­port is ur­gently needed. We are very grate­ful to Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and Te­masek Foun­da­tion for step­ping up so we can con­tinue de­liv­er­ing life-sav­ing sup­plies to those who need them most.”</p>
    <p>SIA is mak­ing the ad hoc char­ter flights and freight space in its sched­uled ser­vices avail­able on a cost-re­cov­ery ba­sis, with flight costs be­ing cov­ered by a con­tri­bu­tion of up to US$6.5 mil­lion (S$8.9 mil­lion) from Te­masek Foun­da­tion, the so­cial and char­ity arm of Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment com­pany Te­masek.</p>
    <p>Mr Chin Yau Seng, SIA’s se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of cargo, said: “This will al­low us to draw on our ex­per­tise as a global air­freight provider, and use our in­ter­na­tional net­work to de­liver es­sen­tial sup­plies to the points of need and help to make a pos­i­tive im­pact on the com­mu­ni­ties that have been di­rectly af­fected by Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ng Boon Heong, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Te­masek Foun­da­tion, said: “This part­ner­ship is one way for us to en­sure that es­sen­tial sup­plies reach com­mu­ni­ties with the most need, even if they are sep­a­rated by dis­tance.”</p>
