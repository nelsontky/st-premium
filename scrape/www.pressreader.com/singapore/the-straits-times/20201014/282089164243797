    <p>Four In­done­sian men who jumped off a boat and swam to­wards Sin­ga­pore have been ar­rested for un­law­ful en­try, the po­lice said yesterday.</p>
    <p>The men, aged be­tween 19 and 38, jumped off an un­num­bered boat into the wa­ters off Tuas re­claimed land be­fore swim­ming to­wards the shore­line.</p>
    <p>They were spot­ted last Fri­day on Tuas re­claimed land by the Po­lice Coast Guard’s (PCG) sur­veil­lance sys­tems at about 8.30pm.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing their de­tec­tion, of­fi­cers from the PCG, Jurong Po­lice Di­vi­sion, Gurkha con­tin­gent, Spe­cial</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tions Com­mand and Home Team Un­manned Aerial Ve­hi­cles Unit re­sponded to ar­rest the four men.</p>
    <p>All were taken into cus­tody within five hours of be­ing spot­ted.</p>
    <p>They were charged in court last Satur­day with un­law­ful en­try into Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>If con­victed, they could be jailed for up to six months and get at least three strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said the men have been handed over to the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity for fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Com­man­der of the PCG, Se­nior As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner of Po­lice Cheang Keng Keong, said: “The of­fi­cers’ vig­i­lance and ex­cel­lent team work, which re­sulted in the swift ar­rest, are highly com­mend­able.</p>
    <p>“PCG will spare no ef­fort and will con­tinue to take firm ac­tion against such of­fend­ers to safe­guard our wa­ters and sea bor­ders against crime and se­cu­rity threats, in­clud­ing unau­tho­rised en­try into and de­par­ture from Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
