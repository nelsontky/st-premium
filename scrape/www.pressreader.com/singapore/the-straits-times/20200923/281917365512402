    <p>NEW YORK • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump as­sailed China for the coro­n­avirus pan­demic in a speech to the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly yes­ter­day, call­ing on the in­ter­na­tional body to pun­ish Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“In the ear­li­est days of the virus, China locked down travel do­mes­ti­cally while al­low­ing flights to leave China and in­fect the world,” Mr Trump said in the speech, which was recorded on Mon­day at the White House and de­liv­ered to the UN ses­sion which is be­ing held mostly vir­tu­ally be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion – which is vir­tu­ally con­trolled by China – falsely de­clared that there was no ev­i­dence of hu­man-to-hu­man trans­mis­sion.”</p>
    <p>“The United Na­tions must hold China ac­count­able for their ac­tions,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has ramped up US ten­sions with China in re­cent months in an at­tempt to por­tray him­self as tougher to­wards the coun­try’s lead­ers than his re-elec­tion op­po­nent, for­mer vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, and to de­flect blame for the coro­n­avirus out­break in the United States, the largest in the world.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has ac­cused Mr Trump of turn­ing a blind eye to the virus’ spread from China as he sought to close his so-called “phase one” trade deal with Bei­jing in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>More than 200,000 Amer­i­cans have died of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Most vot­ers give Mr Trump poor marks for his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­sponse to the pan­demic, jeop­ar­dis­ing his re-elec­tion bid.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who pulled the US out of the Paris Cli­mate Agree­ment, also at­tacked China for its car­bon emis­sions as well as dump­ing of plas­tic. He has drawn in­ter­na­tional crit­i­cism for with­draw­ing the coun­try from the Paris pact ne­go­ti­ated by his pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>“Those who at­tack Amer­ica’s ex­cep­tional en­vi­ron­men­tal record while ig­nor­ing China’s ram­pant pol­lu­tion are not in­ter­ested in the en­vi­ron­ment. They only want to pun­ish Amer­ica. And I will not stand for it.”</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has also launched a global cam­paign against the in­flu­ence of China, push­ing back on its claims in the South China Sea and warn­ing na­tions of the risks of ac­cept­ing its lav­ish in­fra­struc­ture spend­ing.</p>
    <p>It has also sanc­tioned Chi­nese of­fi­cials over their treat­ment of Mus­lim mi­nori­ties, as well as re­moved spe­cial trade ben­e­fits en­joyed by Hong Kong.</p>
