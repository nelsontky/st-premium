        Features Life | | C2 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 30, 2020 145 TOA PAYOH INTERCHANG­E > BUONA VISTA TERMINAL TIP: Try to sit on the right side of the bus on this route, which takes more than 1½ hours. If you ride the bus in the opposite direction – starting from Buona Vista Terminal – expect different views of Bras Basah, Bugis and Chinatown. It may also be harder to get a glimpse of the Keppel Harbour cranes. Photo SHOP
HOUS MONU ES, AND MENT
S CRAN
ES Kampong Glam 1 Look out for Sultan Mosque on the left. You can also alight before the mosque to explore Arab Street. Ser vice 145: Central Fire Station. Boat Quay 2 Spot Parliament House to the left of the bus. Hay Dairies 7 975 BUKIT PANJANG INTERCHANG­E > LIM CHU KANG ROAD Alight opposite Lim Chu Kang Lane 4 and walk down the lane to visit Singapore’s only goat farm. Chinatown 3 Keep an eye out for the Sri Mariamman Temple and Buddha Tooth Relic Temple (right), both on the right side of the bus. Police Coast Guard and jetty (right) TIP: 8 Watch out for traffic if you alight on Lim Chu Kang Road. The entire route takes about 1½ hours.
Do not do this trip after dark – you will not be able to see much, aside from your reflection. Service 172, which begins at Choa Chu Kang Interchang­e, will take you down Jalan Bahar, where more cemeteries are.
If you want to explore the farms and nature reserves in Lim Chu Kang, opt for the Kranji countrysid­e express bus, which stops at Kranji MRT station every day. LIMCHU HERIT KANG AGE ROAD The bus makes a u-turn here. Buses leaving Bukit Panjang Interchang­e after 10.50pm terminate at the Police Coast Guard stop. 4 Central Fire Station 5 Old Hill Street Police Station 1 Interchang­e/terminal Hai Inn Temple 2 Cheng Tai Nursery 8 3 Christian cemetery (right) 7 To the left, as you ride down Old Choa Chu Kang Road and approach the junction with Jalan Bahar. 6 5 Tanjong Pagar Road 6 4 2 Chinese cemetery Old shophouses and Housing Board blocks are juxtaposed against the HDB’s Pinnacle @ Duxton, Singapore’s first 50-storey public housing project. 4 1 3 AYER RAJAH EXPRESSWAY 5 Lim Chu Kang heritage road Stretching between the junction with Ama Keng Road and the junction with Sungei Gedong Road, this road was built in the 1800s to serve the gambier, pepper and rubber plantation­s and used to be lined with single- and two-storey residences and shophouses. Broad-leafed mahogany, angsana and rubber trees can be found here. Keppel Harbour 7 After turning into Keppel Road, look left for a view of large cranes (right). Cable cars 8 Spot them in the distance after HarbourFro­nt MRT station. 9 Henderson Waves Look up after Telok Blangah Heights to get a glimpse of the Henderson Waves bridge (right).
Alight if you fancy a stroll through Mount Faber Park or Telok Blangah Hill Park. NOTE: The 518 and 975 buses are loop services. Neo Tiew estate 6 Holland Village 10 Can you spot…. This abandoned HDB estate next to the junction with Neo Tiew Road consists of three-storey blocks of flats and had a wet market and playground. Residents moved out in 2002 after an en bloc sale, and it was later used by the Singapore Armed Forces for training. Disembark at Block 46 in Holland Drive and walk over for some grub at the popular dining destinatio­n. The different bus stop designs? Look out for the quirky yellow-blue angles in Tampines, the hefty beige-brown slabs outside Far East Plaza, and house-like bus stops along Tanjong Pagar Road.
