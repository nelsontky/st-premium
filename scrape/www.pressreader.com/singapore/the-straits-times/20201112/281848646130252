    <p>• Malaysian po­lice have ar­rested four sus­pects fol­low­ing the lat­est wa­ter pol­lu­tion that shut down four wa­ter treat­ment plants i n Se­lan­gor and l eav­ing more than one mil­lion peo­ple in the Klang Val­ley with dry taps.</p>
    <p>“Act­ing on the lat­est re­ports of wa­ter pol­lu­tion, the po­lice con­ducted ar­rests from mid­night to early morn­ing to­day,” said Se­lan­gor Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment chief Fadzil Ah­mat in a state­ment yes­ter­day, as quoted by The Star.</p>
    <p>He said a 33-year-old Bangladesh­i man and a Malaysian had stock­piled chem­i­cal ma­te­ri­als at a rented plant in Rawang, Se­lan­gor. Po­lice be­lieve some of th­ese chem­i­cals were dumped into a man­hole that flowed to the pol­luted area in Sun­gai Se­lan­gor, Se­nior As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner Fadzil said.</p>
    <p>The sus­pects are be­ing held on a seven-day re­mand for ques­tion­ing, Malay Mail on­line news re­ported.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor and the fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries of Kuala Lumpur and Pu­tra­jaya share the same wa­ter re­sources, in­clud­ing rivers and dams, treat­ment plants and dis­tri­bu­tion pipes.</p>
    <p>Pol­lu­tion af­fect­ing a river in Se­lan­gor would thus af­fect wa­ter sup­ply to parts of the Klang Val­ley that in­cludes Malaysia’s cap­i­tal city of KL, the ad­min­is­tra­tive city of Pu­tra­jaya and Se­lan­gor districts.</p>
    <p>Wa­ter com­pany Pen­gu­ru­san Air Se­lan­gor said yes­ter­day that the four wa­ter treat­ment plants that were shut down on Tues­day have re­sumed op­er­a­tions. Wa­ter sup­ply is ex­pected to be fully re­stored by to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Po­lice found 40 bar­rels stored in the Rawang factory, con­tain­ing about 1,000 litres of chem­i­cals wait­ing for dis­posal.</p>
    <p>“We won’t rule out the pos­si­bil­ity that af­ter in­ves­ti­gat­ing this lo­cal­ity and the premises where the chem­i­cals were dumped, that there could be el­e­ments of sab­o­tage,” said Gom­bak district’s As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner Ari­fai Tarawe, as quoted by Malay Mail.</p>
    <p>The lat­est wa­ter dis­rup­tion came less than three weeks af­ter the last wa­ter sup­ply cut, and led to public anger all over again as peo­ple joined long queues to fetch sup­plies from wa­ter tankers sent to their hous­ing es­tates.</p>
    <p>There have been 10 un­sched­uled sup­ply cuts this year alone in the Klang Val­ley.</p>
    <p>The Se­lan­gor gov­ern­ment has faced public pres­sure to shut the dozens of fac­to­ries si­t­u­ated near rivers that sup­ply wa­ter to the treat­ment plants, be­cause re­cent in­ci­dents of pol­lu­tion mostly orig­i­nated from th­ese plants.</p>
    <p>The Se­lan­gor State Leg­isla­tive Assem­bly on Mon­day passed leg­is­la­tion to raise pun­ish­ment for river pol­luters, in­clud­ing a manda­tory prison sen­tence upon con­vic­tion.</p>
