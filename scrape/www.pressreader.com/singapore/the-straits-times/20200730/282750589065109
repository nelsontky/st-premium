    <p>Few tunes are as cel­e­brated as Beethoven’s Ode To Joy. In hon­our of the com­poser’s 250th birth year anniversar­y, the work will be brought to life once more on In­ter­na­tional Friend­ship Day to­day.</p>
    <p>Led by Sin­ga­pore’s Wong Kah Chun, chief con­duc­tor of the Nurem­berg Sym­phony Orches­tra, the vir­tual per­for­mance, Beethoven 360°, brings to­gether a cast of mu­si­cians from across 25 na­tions per­form­ing mu­sic from the renowned Ger­man com­poser’s Ninth Sym­phony.</p>
    <p>Pieced to­gether with dig­i­tal sub­mis­sions by in­stru­men­tal­ists and singers from mu­sic in­sti­tu­tions world­wide, the show also brings to­gether more than 1,000 par­tic­i­pants as part of a global cam­paign for a sin­ga­long in the Ode To Joy seg­ment.</p>
    <p>For post­grad­u­ate mu­sic stu­dent and Beethoven 360° par­tic­i­pant Goh Mok Cheong, 24, to­day’s pre­miere is a rare chance to share his pas­sion with his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The bas­soon­ist has trained in mu­sic for 11 years and is a free­lance mu­si­cian. He joined the project in May af­ter work­ing with Wong on a sim­i­lar project in April.</p>
    <p>Says Mr Goh: “My par­ents do not have a mu­si­cal back­ground, but Ode To Joy will still be re­lat­able to them. More than just a Covid-19re­lated vir­tual per­for­mance, this has given us the op­por­tu­nity to adapt and put across a mes­sage of sol­i­dar­ity to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Mr Arka­diusz Czo­por, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy firm T-Sys­tems South Asia, which is a plat­inum spon­sor of the project, says the con­cert “builds links with tech­nol­ogy that al­low us to re­con­nect through the beauty of Beethoven’s mu­sic”.</p>
    <p>“We could eas­ily iden­tify with the project and hope that it of­fers a small to­ken of re­lief to mu­si­cians in Sin­ga­pore and be­yond at a time when artists world­wide are strug­gling with the ef­fects of the pan­demic,” he adds.</p>
    <p>The per­for­mance is also a step for­ward in deep­en­ing cul­tural ties be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Ger­many.</p>
    <p>The show pro­pels the an­nual Ger­man-Sin­ga­porean open-air con­cert, Beethoven Im Garten, into the vir­tual world for lis­ten­ers from across the globe to en­joy from the com­fort of home.</p>
    <p>Pre­sented by the Ger­man em­bassy in Sin­ga­pore and the Foun­da­tion for The Arts and So­cial En­ter­prise with fund­ing sup­port from spon­sors in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC) and the Fed­eral For­eign Of­fice of Ger­many, Beethoven 360° is the first part­ner­ship of its kind be­tween a for­eign em­bassy and a lo­cal cul­tural in­sti­tu­tion since the out­break of the pan­demic. The per­for­mance is also part of NAC’s #SGCul­tureAny­where cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore, Dr Ul­rich Sante, says the idea for a con­cert was sparked by his meet­ing with Wong and the mu­tual un­der­stand­ing that there was a niche au­di­ence that was ap­pre­cia­tive of clas­si­cal mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Dr Sante says the pre­vi­ously out­door con­cert, with peo­ple of dif­fer­ent na­tion­al­i­ties sit­ting to­gether en­joy­ing mu­sic, was an in­spi­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Not only as a diplo­mat but as a hu­man be­ing on this globe, that is what I think this globe needs, such a way of com­mu­ni­cat­ing with each other with­out any prej­u­dice,” he adds.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing on the dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of the con­cert this year, Dr Sante says the pre­sen­ta­tion of the mu­sic from the Ninth Sym­phony through the vir­tual medium was ex­cep­tional.</p>
    <p>The con­cert also marks an­other key mile­stone – The Straits Times’ 175th anniversar­y.</p>
    <p>Mr War­ren Fer­nan­dez, editor-inchief of Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ English/Malay/Tamil Me­dia Group and editor of The Straits Times, says: “This year we are mark­ing the 175th anniversar­y of The Straits Times. So when I heard about the project, Beethoven Im Garten and the Ode To</p>
    <p>Joy which cel­e­brates uni­ver­sal brother­hood and that sense of all­to­geth­er­ness, it seemed to make sense.</p>
    <p>“This be­ing the 250th anniversar­y of Beethoven’s birth as well as me be­ing a lover of the mu­sic, it all came to­gether and there­fore I was very happy to be a part of the project.”</p>
    <p>The show is op­ti­mised for smart­phones and tablets but can also be watched on com­put­ers.</p>
