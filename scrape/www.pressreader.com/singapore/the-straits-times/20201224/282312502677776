    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s bad­minton world No. 1 Kento Mo­mota shrugged off nerves to make a win­ning re­turn to com­pe­ti­tion yes­ter­day, nearly a year af­ter suf­fer­ing se­ri­ous in­juries in a car crash.</p>
    <p>He de­feated com­pa­triot Koshiro Moriguchi 21-12, 21-14 in the first round of the All-Ja­pan cham­pi­onships, mark­ing his long-awaited re­turn from the Jan­uary ac­ci­dent that left him fear­ing his ca­reer might be over af­ter frac­tur­ing an eye socket.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old will be hop­ing his come­back leads him all the way to Olympic gold, which would be his coun­try’s first in the sin­gles event, at next year’s Tokyo Games.</p>
    <p>But the left-han­der was equally happy just to be back on the court af­ter dis­patch­ing his op­po­nent in 36 min­utes.</p>
    <p>“I had that par­tic­u­lar feel­ing that you get be­fore a match, the kind where you just can’t sit still, and it’s been a while since I felt that,” said Mo­mota, who was badly hurt when the ve­hi­cle tak­ing him to Kuala Lumpur In­ter­na­tional Air­port af­ter he had won the Malaysia Masters crashed, killing the driver.</p>
    <p>“I went out onto the court and it re­ally felt like I was back. I en­joyed it.”</p>
    <p>Mo­mota be­gan the match with lit­tle fuss as he won the first five points, but then went on to mis­judge sev­eral base­line shots from his op­po­nent in an er­ror-strewn open­ing game.</p>
    <p>He set­tled into his rhythm more in the sec­ond game, and closed the match out with a re­sound­ing smash to book his place in the next round.</p>
    <p>“I missed a lot of shots be­cause of nerves,” he ac­knowl­edged. “My move­ment and feel­ing for the shut­tle weren’t bad, but I want to cut down on the mis­takes in my next match.</p>
    <p>“I man­aged to speed up the play and land a few smashes, but there were a lot of times where I was too slow with my re­turns. I need to think more about how I re­act to each shot and mix things up a lit­tle.”</p>
    <p>Mo­mota is aim­ing to win a third straight na­tional ti­tle this week in Tokyo, be­fore head­ing to Thailand next month for the re­sump­tion of the BWF World Tour.</p>
    <p>He is hop­ing to re­cap­ture the form that saw him win a record­break­ing 11 ti­tles last year, and be­lieves he will be­gin to hit his stride now that he has cleared the first hur­dle.</p>
    <p>“I was ner­vous be­cause it was the first match of the All-Ja­pan cham­pi­onships, and it was also my first match in a long time,” he said. “There were a lot of things that made me feel un­com­fort­able, but de­spite all that, I was able to re­lax and play my game. I’m happy with that.”</p>
