    <p>Its prox­im­ity to Wind­sor Na­ture Park was one of the main rea­sons that drew the na­ture-lov­ing cou­ple to this es­tate off Venus Drive.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­turn­ing from a four-year work stint over­seas, they felt it was the per­fect lo­ca­tion to build their home – one that was “mod­ern and un­der­stated, and which blended in with the nat­u­ral sur­round­ings”.</p>
    <p>The site con­di­tions, how­ever, were far from ideal. An ex­ist­ing drain cut through the rear of the prop­erty and there was a steep slope at the back of the house. The neigh­bour’s bound­ary wall also en­croached on the plot.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ed­mund Ng of home­grown ar­chi­tec­ture firm Ed­mund Ng Ar­chi­tects was able to over­come the tech­ni­cal chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>With the orig­i­nal house de­mol­ished, the drainage di­verted, the bound­ary is­sue re­solved and the slope back­filled, con­struc­tion pro­ceeded with­out a hitch and the new house – a cor­ner ter­race with a built-up area of 6,000 sq ft – was com­pleted in 10 months.</p>
    <p>The own­ers – the hus­band is in his early 50s and works in in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy, and his wife is in her late 40s and works in the le­gal field – their two teenage chil­dren and a labradoo­dle moved in in September 2017. They de­clined to re­veal the cost of the project.</p>
    <p>While many would lament the nar­row frontage of the tri­an­gu­lar plot sur­rounded by neigh­bour­ing houses, this suits the own­ers well.</p>
    <p>“We value pri­vacy and the con­fig­u­ra­tion al­lows the cre­ation of hid­den fam­ily spa­ces within a home nes­tled among the neigh­bour­ing houses in­stead of tow­er­ing over them.”</p>
    <p>A void along the party wall with the ad­ja­cent house cre­ates a sep­a­ra­tion for more pri­vacy. Mr Ng says: “It also makes the cor­ner ter­race ap­pear like a de­tached house.”</p>
    <p>As the tri­an­gu­lar-shaped land opens up to­wards the rear of the prop­erty, mov­ing through the var­i­ous spa­ces sur­rounded by green­ery is like dis­cov­er­ing a se­cret gar­den.</p>
    <p>There are more than 50 va­ri­eties of trop­i­cal plants such as thun­ber­gia, thalias, salas and cym­bid­i­ums. Planted along the bound­ary walls, the dif­fer­ent heights, shapes, sizes and tex­tures cre­ate a lay­ered com­po­si­tion that soft­ens the wall and en­hances the sense of pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>As na­ture lovers with an en­vi­ron­men­tally con­scious life­style, the own­ers em­brace trop­i­cal liv­ing, so al­most all the fen­es­tra­tions ex­tend from the floor to the ceil­ing, blur­ring the bound­ary be­tween the in­te­rior and the out­doors.</p>
    <p>With the full-height glass doors around the liv­ing and din­ing ar­eas open, the spa­ces feel like they are part of the sur­round­ing gar­den.</p>
    <p>The bed­rooms, fam­ily lounge and study all open out to bal­conies – main­tain­ing the con­nec­tion with na­ture and the out­doors.</p>
    <p>The gen­er­ous ex­ter­nal open­ings also help fa­cil­i­tate nat­u­ral crossven­ti­la­tion through­out the home and ad­justable ver­ti­cal lou­vres on the east-fac­ing fa­cade min­imise glare and heat from the sun, as well as keep away cu­ri­ous eyes.</p>
    <p>In­side, there are no dead ends. Every room is linked via two or more in­ter­con­nect­ing doors. “We wanted every space to be well­con­nected and well-utilised. There should be no iso­lated spa­ces,” the own­ers say.</p>
    <p>Cre­at­ing a se­ries of smaller, in­ter­con­nected lay­outs also makes them eas­ier to cool and en­hances en­ergy ef­fi­ciency through­out. So­lar pan­els on the pitched roof power the home and pro­vide ad­di­tional in­su­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The de­sign of the home – an ex­pres­sion of wabi-sabi, the Ja­panese phi­los­o­phy of find­ing and ac­cept­ing beauty in im­per­fec­tion and im­per­ma­nence – is also a cel­e­bra­tion of the or­ganic beauty of nat­u­ral ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, there is a raw­ness in the off-form con­crete walls and the Corten steel roof, as well as a fa­cade that will rust over time.</p>
