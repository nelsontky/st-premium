    <p>TOKYO • In his first high-level meet­ing with a se­nior Chi­nese of­fi­cial, Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga said sta­ble ties with China are im­por­tant, as his coun­try pur­sues a bal­anc­ing act with its neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi met Mr Suga at the end of his two-day trip in Ja­pan, mark­ing the first high-level visit since Mr Suga was elected as the new Ja­panese leader in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“A sta­ble re­la­tion­ship be­tween the two coun­tries is im­por­tant not only for Ja­pan and China but also for the re­gion and the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity,” Mr Suga told Mr Wang in a meet­ing that lasted about 20 min­utes.</p>
    <p>The visit by Mr Wang comes amid grow­ing con­cerns over Bei­jing’s as­sertive­ness in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>While Mr Suga steered clear of the harsh anti-China rhetoric used by the United States – Ja­pan’s ally – he has moved to counter its in­flu­ence by deep­en­ing ties with Aus­tralia and choos­ing Viet­nam and In­done­sia for his first over­seas trip.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s se­cu­rity strat­egy is grounded on its al­liance with the US, but it has also pur­sued eco­nomic in­ter­ests with China, its top trad­ing part­ner.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping wants to build “good work­ing re­la­tions” with his Ja­panese coun­ter­part, Mr Wang said, cit­ing a mes­sage from Mr Xi that he de­liv­ered to Mr Suga.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang also said that bi­lat­eral re­la­tions have “fi­nally re­turned” to a nor­mal de­vel­op­ment path.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang met his Ja­panese coun­ter­part Toshim­itsu Motegi on Tues­day. They agreed to co­op­er­ate on trade and fight­ing the coro­n­avirus, but main­tained their stances on ter­ri­to­rial dis­putes, leav­ing a se­cu­rity con­cern un­re­solved.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan and China agreed to re­sume busi­ness travel this month and to con­tinue talks on dis­puted isles in the East China Sea.</p>
    <p>“I hope both sides will han­dle the is­sue calmly and prop­erly so that sta­ble im­prove­ment in ties and fur­ther de­vel­op­ment in Sino-Ja­panese re­la­tions won’t be af­fected,” Mr Wang told re­porters af­ter his meet­ing with Mr Suga, re­fer­ring to the sit­u­a­tion in the East China Sea.</p>
    <p>Still, dur­ing Mr Wang’s visit, top Ja­panese of­fi­cials re­it­er­ated con­cerns over China’s continuing ac­tiv­ity in the area, but Mr Wang stood by Bei­jing’s stance that it was pro­tect­ing its sovereignt­y.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s gov­ern­ment has com­plained of China’s “re­lent­less” in­tru­sions in wa­ters around the islets claimed by both na­tions.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in Tokyo, in­clud­ing Mr Suga, also re­peat­edly ex­pressed con­cerns to Mr Wang over devel­op­ments in Hong Kong, a po­lit­i­cally sen­si­tive is­sue for Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Push­ing for­ward a three-way free trade deal with Ja­pan and South Korea, Mr Wang is headed to Seoul and will meet South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in to­day.</p>
