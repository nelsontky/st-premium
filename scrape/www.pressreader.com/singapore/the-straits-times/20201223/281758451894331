    <p>Tai­wan recorded a lo­cally-trans­mit­ted Covid-19 case yes­ter­day, the first such in 253 days or since April 12, the Cen­tral Epi­demic Com­mand Cen­tre (CECC) said.</p>
    <p>Four cases were recorded yes­ter­day, three of them im­ported and in­volv­ing peo­ple re­turn­ing from the Philip­pines. The is­land’s case count stood at 771 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The do­mes­tic case in ques­tion is a Tai­wanese woman in her 30s. She was in close con­tact with Case 765, a New Zealand pi­lot who tested pos­i­tive on Dec 20.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, the CECC said that between Dec 8 and 11, the pi­lot vis­ited sev­eral shop­ping cen­tres in Taipei’s Tianmu dis­trict as well as a Costco Whole­sale store in Taoyuan, which is not far from the main in­ter­na­tional air­port.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Chen Shi­hchung, who was also at the press con­fer­ence, asked peo­ple who had vis­ited the same places on the same dates to mon­i­tor their health and to get tested if they be­gin to ex­pe­ri­ence Covid-19 symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The law en­force­ment and health au­thor­i­ties dis­cov­ered that the pi­lot, who works for Tai­wan’s EVA Air­ways, was not truth­ful in fill­ing out a health re­port, con­ceal­ing the fact that he fre­quently met up with friends while he was in the most in­fec­tious pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The Taoyuan Depart­ment of Pub­lic Health will fine him NT$300,000 (S$14,200) for vi­o­lat­ing the Com­mu­ni­ca­ble Dis­ease Con­trol Act.</p>
    <p>EVA Air said yes­ter­day that its man­age­ment will meet to dis­cuss the pi­lot’s mis­con­duct, which in­cluded not wear­ing a mask when he was fly­ing and not fil­ing a truth­ful health re­port. If found guilty, he can be dis­missed. The pi­lot’s re­fusal to don a mask re­sulted in two other pi­lots be­ing in­fected with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>His shop­ping trip also put some 167 peo­ple in the CECC’s con­tact trac­ing sys­tem, all of whom are now be­ing tested for the coro­n­avirus. Thir­teen are in home quar­an­tine while the oth­ers are mon­i­tor­ing them­selves for symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The case puts a damper on the up­com­ing hol­i­day cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen called for the Cab­i­net and the CECC to dis­cuss new pre­cau­tions for New Year’s Eve cel­e­bra­tions, while Taipei Deputy Mayor Huang Shan­shan yes­ter­day said the city’s New Year count­down – which draws hun­dreds of thou­sands each year – will be held as usual, although ev­ery­one tak­ing part will have to wear masks. All out­door gath­er­ings sched­uled around New Taipei City’s ex­trav­a­gant Christ­mas lights dis­play will be put on hold.</p>
