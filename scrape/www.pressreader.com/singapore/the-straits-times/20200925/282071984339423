    <p>A small team of nurses from SingHealth Poly­clin­ics (SHP) have been work­ing tire­lessly dur­ing their lunch breaks, af­ter of­fice hours and on week­ends to sew masks for char­ity.</p>
    <p>The hand-made masks are be­ing sold to SHP staff and their fam­ily mem­bers to raise money for needy pa­tients, said as­sis­tant direc­tor of nurs­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion Tan Siam King yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, 64, who is be­hind the ini­tia­tive, told The Straits Times that she got the idea for the project dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The nurse of 30 years said: “Sur­gi­cal masks at that pe­riod of time were hard to get and very costly. I thought maybe a cloth mask could be more use­ful, com­fort­able and func­tional.”</p>
    <p>So she started mak­ing masks for friends and fam­ily. She gave some as presents to her col­leagues for Nurses’ Day last month.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, who does not sew of­ten, said she learnt how to make the masks from an ST ar­ti­cle in March.</p>
    <p>Those who re­ceived the masks told her that they liked them and found them com­fort­able, which in­spired her to ex­pand her ef­forts.</p>
    <p>She put out a call for vol­un­teers last month, wary of the fact that nurses have busy sched­ules and that peo­ple have other pri­or­i­ties, es­pe­cially on week­ends, fol­low­ing the lift­ing of the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>But she was heart­ened to see around two dozen nurses show up for the first ses­sion on Aug 29. Those who did not know how to sew helped with other tasks such as cut­ting ma­te­ri­als and as­sem­bling the masks.</p>
    <p>The ma­te­ri­als and sewing ma­chines were all sourced by the nurses, who bore the cost them­selves.</p>
    <p>Af­ter that first ses­sion, about 90 masks were fin­ished. But Ms Tan and a team of eight oth­ers de­cided to press on and do more.</p>
    <p>From Sept 1 to 18, they gath­ered in small groups dur­ing their lunch hour, af­ter work, and dur­ing the week­ends to carry on as­sem­bling and sewing more masks.</p>
    <p>By the end of the project, over 430 masks were com­pleted.</p>
    <p>“I’m happy to see peo­ple are so sup­port­ive... I think nurses have this ca­ma­raderie – when we do some­thing, we come to­gether to sup­port each other. It’s in our na­ture,” said Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>The masks were sold for about $10 each, al­though some buy­ers de­cided to pay more. Pro­ceeds from the sales were chan­nelled into the Gift of Fam­ily Fund, which is man­aged by the SingHealth Fund and helps needy pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Aside from help­ing the less for­tu­nate, Ms Tan said that the mask-sewing ses­sions served as stress re­lief for the nurses, who were happy to vol­un­teer.</p>
    <p>She added: “My col­leagues say they find it very ther­a­peu­tic – they don’t find it tir­ing to do this dur­ing their lunchtime and in the even­ing. I think it’s be­cause it’s some­thing that’s dif­fer­ent from what we usu­ally do. The ac­tiv­ity gives them an op­por­tu­nity to de-stress and take their minds off (work).</p>
    <p>“For me, look­ing at the fin­ished prod­uct gives me a sense of sat­is­fac­tion, es­pe­cially when peo­ple buy and com­pli­ment the masks.”</p>
