    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has led to a spike in the num­ber of com­plaints re­lated to travel book­ings, wed­ding con­tracts, med­i­cal prod­ucts, and food and gro­cery de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>Many in­volved lost de­posits for travel and wed­ding plans that had to be put off, as well as grouses re­lated to the pric­ing of face masks and hand sani­tis­ers.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures from the Con­sumers As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore showed that be­tween Fe­bru­ary and July, 1,133 com­plaints were filed against the travel in­dus­try, while an­other 126 were made against the bri­dal in­dus­try, among oth­ers. The fig­ures were sig­nif­i­cantly higher com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, more than 6,500 no­tices seek­ing a six-month le­gal re­prieve from con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions have also been sub­mit­ted by in­di­vid­u­als and busi­nesses, ac­cord­ing to fig­ures from the Min­istry of Law.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of those who sought re­lief from their con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions un­der laws passed ear­lier this year did so re­gard­ing prop­erty leas­ing and li­cens­ing agree­ments.</p>
    <p>But only about one in six no­tices served ended up in dis­pute.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has led to a spike in the num­ber of com­plaints re­lated to travel book­ings, wed­ding con­tracts, med­i­cal prod­ucts and food and gro­cery de­liv­er­ies, fig­ures from the Con­sumers As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (Case) show.</p>
    <p>Many in­volved lost de­posits for travel and wed­ding plans that had to be put off due to re­stric­tions im­posed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Be­tween Fe­bru­ary and July, the con­sumer watch­dog re­ceived 1,133 com­plaints against the travel in­dus­try, up from 218 dur­ing the same pe­riod last year. A sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of these were from those who were un­able to get re­funds after be­ing forced to can­cel tour pack­ages, ho­tels and flights due to global travel re­stric­tions, Case told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Some were charged a fee for can­celling or post­pon­ing their trips, while oth­ers were given travel vouch­ers in lieu of cash re­funds.</p>
    <p>Com­plaints against ho­tels and travel book­ing web­sites more than dou­bled from 50 be­tween Fe­bru­ary and July last year to 124 dur­ing the same pe­riod this year. A num­ber of op­er­a­tors had re­jected can­cel­la­tion re­quests, cit­ing non-re­fund­able book­ing poli­cies, Case said.</p>
    <p>Grouses against the bri­dal in­dus­try went up from 78 to 126 over the same six-month pe­riod. De­spite a ban on mass gath­er­ings, some ho­tels did not al­low cou­ples to post­pone their wed­ding ban­quets, or re­fused to of­fer re­funds for can­cel­la­tions. De­posits for re­lated con­tracts such as photo pack­ages and food cater­ing were also re­ported as lost.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the 731 com­plaints against re­tail­ers of med­i­cal con­sum­ables re­lated to the pric­ing of face masks and hand sani­tis­ers, as well as the qual­ity of masks sold by on­line re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>The cir­cuit breaker fu­elled a surge in de­mand for food and gro­cery de­liv­er­ies, lead­ing to com­plaints about miss­ing items and de­liv­ery is­sues. There were 255 com­plaints re­lat­ing to such de­liv­ery or­ders for the six months ended July.</p>
    <p>Mrs Cas­san­dra Teng’s first ex­pe­ri­ence us­ing RedMart in April was less than ideal when only half of her or­ders were de­liv­ered, she told The Straits Times. The gen­eral man­ager at a wire and ca­ble com­pany bought about $100 worth of gro­ceries which in­cluded pa­per tow­els, flour and veg­eta­bles. “When the de­liv­ery came, I only re­ceived the dry goods. The fresh food was not de­liv­ered,” said Mrs Teng, 56.</p>
    <p>She re­ceived a re­fund for the miss­ing items later that month.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Ruddy, chief re­tail of­fi­cer and head of gro­cery at Lazada Sin­ga­pore, which owns RedMart, said weekly or­ders tripled in Fe­bru­ary and it was more than the firm could han­dle. But like other on­line gro­cers and food de­liv­ery op­er­a­tors, RedMart in­creased its ca­pac­ity and is now “ad­e­quately pre­pared for fu­ture surges”.</p>
    <p>Case said it has been help­ing con­sumers ne­go­ti­ate with busi­nesses on dis­putes, and guid­ing them in fil­ing claims with as­ses­sors ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Law if an agree­ment can­not be reached.</p>
    <p>A health­care pro­fes­sional who gave her name as Ms Wong said she spent weeks try­ing to get a re­fund on plane tick­ets for her fam­ily of four after Is­rael banned trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing bought the tick­ets – and travel in­sur­ance – be­fore the out­break, she had as­sumed the process would be fuss-free. But after be­ing bounced around from the air­line to a third-party book­ing site, and then to an in­surer, which de­nied her claim, she de­cided to ap­proach Case.</p>
    <p>The watch­dog’s in­ter­ven­tion led the in­sur­ance provider to of­fer Ms Wong com­pen­sa­tion for the full value of the tick­ets, amount­ing to nearly $6,000. “As a con­sumer, you don’t re­ally know what to do in these sit­u­a­tions... Case helped to lay out my op­tions and con­tact the in­surer, so I am very grate­ful,” said Ms Wong, 27.</p>
