    <p>With no travel prospects this year, in­ter­na­tional schools have lined up hol­i­day plans for stu­dents.</p>
    <p>The aca­demic year for many in­ter­na­tional schools here ends in June or July, and the new term starts in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral schools are hold­ing sum­mer pro­grammes on cam­pus, of­fer­ing ed­u­ca­tional and in­ter­ac­tive ses­sions to keep stu­dents en­gaged.</p>
    <p>More than 1,500 Tan­glin Trust School (TTS) stu­dents are tak­ing part in a three-week sum­mer pro­gramme on cam­pus this month.</p>
    <p>Mr Tom Evans, the school’s di­rec­tor of mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, said: “Dur­ing this ex­tended hol­i­day break, it is more im­por­tant than usual to keep our stu­dents en­gaged with learn­ing, in con­tact with their peers, and to give par­ents a much-needed break.”</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, which is funded by the school’s char­ity arm TTS Foun­da­tion, con­sists of ac­tiv­i­ties rang­ing from phon­ics and phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion, to in­no­va­tion and aca­demic lessons, ac­cord­ing to stu­dents’ ages.</p>
    <p>At the Sin­ga­pore Amer­i­can School (SAS), cour­ses planned for six weeks from June 8 saw over 1,000 stu­dents en­rolled in the weekly ses­sions, which each cost about $800. The top­ics ranged from po­etry writ­ing and cook­ing to cod­ing and learn­ing a lan­guage.</p>
    <p>SAS su­per­in­ten­dent Tom Boas­berg said: “Vir­tu­ally all our stu­dents and fac­ulty have re­mained in Sin­ga­pore. We en­cour­aged and re­lied on our teach­ers’ imag­i­na­tion and asked them to dream up and de­sign a series of week-long cour­ses in ar­eas they are pas­sion­ate about.”</p>
    <p>He noted that pre­cau­tions, such as SafeEn­try reg­is­tra­tion and mask-wear­ing, were still fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>At UWCSEA, four weeks of hol­i­day ac­tiv­i­ties started on July 6, with the col­lege cov­er­ing 80 per cent of the to­tal cost. Stu­dents can take their pick from ses­sions in sports and fit­ness, vis­ual and per­form­ing arts, lan­guages and other op­tions.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional French School (Sin­ga­pore) has come up with a four-week pro­gramme of 25 ac­tiv­i­ties, from art and cul­ture to sci­ence and sports work­shops, to keep stu­dents oc­cu­pied. Half-day ses­sions cost $300 per week and full-day ses­sions are $490.</p>
    <p>In­vic­tus In­ter­na­tional School had over 80 stu­dents en­rolled for the first three weeks of its sum­mer camp, which was con­ducted both on­line and in per­son at its Dempsey cam­pus. It ex­pects an at­ten­dance of over 150 for the en­tire six-week pro­gramme. The vir­tual ses­sion costs about $278 per week, while a half-day phys­i­cal camp is $300 and the full-day is $500.</p>
