    <p>In ro­man­tic com­edy K-drama Please Don’t Date Him, char­ac­ters can turn to ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) to an­a­lyse a po­ten­tial date’s so­cial me­dia and on­line his­tory for his or her crit­i­cal flaws.</p>
    <p>But the show’s leads, Lee Jun-young and Song Ha-yoon, say they would stay away from such tech­nol­ogy if it ex­isted in real life.</p>
    <p>Here are five things that the duo have to say about their new se­ries, which is avail­able on Viu.</p>
    <p>1 AI? NO THANKS</p>
    <p>In the se­ries, Song (Fight For My Way, 2017) plays Ji-sung, a de­vel­oper of AI-op­er­ated ap­pli­ances who dis­cov­ers through an AI pro­gram that her fi­ance has been send­ing a group chat com­pro­mis­ing pho­tos of her with­out her con­sent.</p>
    <p>In real life, the 34-year-old ac­tress says she would not use an AI ser­vice to dis­cover her ro­man­tic part­ners’ true na­ture even if it were avail­able.</p>
    <p>She says: “I think I’ll get to meet my boyfriend through hav­ing con­ver­sa­tions and shar­ing feel­ings with him. Whether my choice was a good one or not, I would choose to see, feel and learn as many things as I can within the choices I have made and the time I have.”</p>
    <p>Lee, 23, who plays a fire­fighter in the se­ries, agrees. He says: “I trust my own gut feel­ing. I think it is cruel to de­cide whether to date some­one even be­fore ex­pe­ri­enc­ing them as a per­son.”</p>
    <p>2 NOVEL CON­CEPT</p>
    <p>The in­cor­po­ra­tion of AI tech­nol­ogy into the story, and the lighter touch the show brings to more se­ri­ous so­ci­etal is­sues, were what at­tracted the leads to sign on for the show.</p>
    <p>Lee, a mem­ber of boy band U-Kiss, says: “The idea of AI sur­fac­ing more and more as time goes on, and putting that into the sub­ject of ro­mance, was amaz­ing, in­ter­est­ing and novel to me.”</p>
    <p>Song, whose char­ac­ter at­tempts to re­port her fi­ance to the po­lice for dis­tribut­ing in­ti­mate pic­tures of her, says: “It was good that these events that can pos­si­bly hap­pen in real life were not pre­sented in a man­ner that feels too heavy, but were also pre­sented in an hon­est and straight­for­ward way.”</p>
    <p>3 AGE GAP NOT AN IS­SUE</p>
    <p>Song and Lee, who are more than 10 years apart in age, carry the se­ries’ main ro­man­tic arc.</p>
    <p>Lee, who is younger and started act­ing in 2017 with the drama Avengers So­cial Club, set aside all age-gap con­cerns once film­ing be­gan.</p>
    <p>He says: “We should not be think­ing about our se­nior-ju­nior re­la­tion­ship in front of the cam­eras, so there wasn’t any­thing that I felt awk­ward about.”</p>
    <p>Song says: “Jun-young was con­sid­er­ate and had a pru­dent side to him. Our chem­istry was good be­cause he made me feel com­fort­able.”</p>
    <p>4 BYE BYE SO­CIAL ME­DIA</p>
    <p>Lee’s char­ac­ter is the only one Ji-sung’s pro­gram can­not read, as he rarely uses the In­ter­net and has ab­so­lutely no so­cial me­dia pres­ence.</p>
    <p>When asked if they can stay away from so­cial me­dia plat­forms, the stars say yes.</p>
    <p>Lee says: “I think I can do it. Al­though it’s great for my fans, I do some­times won­der if com­mu­ni­cat­ing with them on so­cial me­dia is bet­ter than meet­ing them in per­son.”</p>
    <p>Song has never been the type to grav­i­tate to­wards so­cial me­dia. “I am not the kind who likes to ex­pose my­self, so I’m still ner­vous about be­ing on so­cial me­dia.”</p>
    <p>5 FROM IDOL TO AC­TOR</p>
    <p>Lee, who de­buted as a mem­ber of U-Kiss in 2014 and was briefly also part of the now-dis­banded boy band UNB for a year, has not had it easy tran­si­tion­ing from idol singer to act­ing – but he does not dwell on it.</p>
    <p>He says: “I used to think a lot about the prej­u­dice against ac­tors who started as idols, but re­gard­less of that, I fo­cus on be­ing faith­ful to the script and be­ing sin­cere when it comes to por­tray­ing my char­ac­ters – (these) are the most im­por­tant things.”</p>
