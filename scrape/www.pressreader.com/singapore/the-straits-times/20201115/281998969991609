    <p>TOKYO • Ar­chi­tec­ture buff Tat­suyuki Maeda ex­cit­edly shows this writer pho­to­graphs of the Pearl Bank Apart­ments in Sin­ga­pore, taken on a trip last year, as he mar­vels at the build­ing’s strik­ingly iconic horse­shoe-shaped cylin­dri­cal struc­ture.</p>
    <p>Built in 1976, the build­ing was de­mol­ished this year, and Mr Maeda is now fight­ing an up­hill bat­tle to save a beloved 1970s icon in Tokyo from meet­ing the same fate.</p>
    <p>The Nak­a­gin Cap­sule Tower was com­pleted in 1972 and is seen as a key sym­bol of Ja­pan’s post-war Metabolism ar­chi­tec­ture move­ment, which was based on the prin­ci­ples of mod­u­lar­ity. In­di­vid­ual seg­ments of such build­ings can be ex­panded, changed, or even re­moved with­out dis­rupt­ing their over­all struc­ture.</p>
    <p>The tower, on the out­skirts of the Ginza shop­ping district, com­prises 140 pre­fab­ri­cated cap­sules stacked on top of one an­other across two wings.</p>
    <p>Years of ne­glect have left many too run-down to be used but about 80 still func­tion as homes, of­fices or cre­ative stu­dios.</p>
    <p>Mr Maeda, 53, now works full-time on a cam­paign to pre­serve the build­ing, or­gan­is­ing pub­lic tours and open­ing up units for rent on a monthly ba­sis to raise aware­ness of its likely doom.</p>
    <p>“I will not give up fight­ing, though the odds are stacked against us,” he says. He owns 15 cap­sules, hav­ing em­barked on a buy­ing spree since 2009 when he first fell in love with the build­ing.</p>
    <p>The late ar­chi­tect Kisho Kurokawa’s vi­sion was to re­place the cap­sules ev­ery 25 years, but this was never done. Now the peel­ing walls ex­pose the in­ner as­bestos ma­te­rial, and the units no longer have hot wa­ter.</p>
    <p>The Nak­a­gin Cap­sule Tower has gained world­wide at­ten­tion, hav­ing been fea­tured in mag­a­zines like Wall­pa­per* and in movies like The Wolver­ine: Sa­mu­rai (2013), but all this may not be enough.</p>
    <p>To the world, Tokyo projects an im­age of hy­per­moder­nity co­ex­ist­ing with a rich his­tory. But apart from sa­cred places of wor­ship such as shrines and tem­ples, other struc­tures are not spared the wreck­ing ball.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral that sur­vived the air raid bomb­ings of World War II, such as the JR Hara­juku Sta­tion and the Toshima-en theme park, have been torn down.</p>
    <p>Other icons built in the post-war years have also been de­mol­ished and re­built. They in­clude the orig­i­nal Ho­tel Okura, which was built in 1962 and shut in 2015. In its place is a gleam­ing new ho­tel, fol­low­ing a 110 bil­lion yen (S$1.4 bil­lion) re­build­ing project.</p>
    <p>This is not just a trend in Tokyo, where the Olympic Games drove a flurry of re­de­vel­op­ment projects when the city won the bid in 2013.</p>
    <p>Over in Hiroshima, ac­tivists are fight­ing to pro­tect four struc­tures that were built in 1913, and com­prised the old Im­pe­rial Ja­panese Army Cloth­ing De­pot, from be­ing torn down. These were among some of the largest struc­tures to sur­vive the atomic bomb­ing.</p>
    <p>And over in Oita, on Kyushu Is­land in south-west­ern Ja­pan, work has be­gun to dis­man­tle the Fun­dokin Man­sion, an iconic prop­erty built in 1967 that drew at­ten­tion for its ul­tra-modern fea­tures, such as a can­tilevered, over­hang­ing bal­cony.</p>
    <p>SOUL­LESS CITIES</p>
    <p>Mr Maeda laments the loss of these his­toric build­ings, and the fact that many peo­ple in Ja­pan are wed­ded to the idea of gleam­ing new sky­scrapers as signs of progress.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edges prag­matic eco­nomic forces, with many landown­ers hop­ing to milk the cash cow of ris­ing land prices, as well as safety con­cerns from the fact that many old sites are nei­ther earth­quake nor fire proof.</p>
    <p>But Dr Osamu Goto of Tokyo’s Ko­gakuin Univer­sity, an ex­pert in pre­serv­ing and restor­ing his­tor­i­cal land­marks, warns of a “large his­tor­i­cal debt in the fu­ture” if Ja­pan stays on its cur­rent path.</p>
    <p>“Cities ben­e­fit more if their build­ings and streets have their own char­ac­ter, rather than a uni­form look,” he says, driv­ing both tourism and lo­cal pride.</p>
    <p>He calls for na­tional guide­lines that oblige de­vel­op­ers to as­sess the his­tor­i­cal and cul­tural im­pact on ar­eas when build­ings get ear­marked for de­mo­li­tion.</p>
    <p>For the Nak­a­gin Cap­sule Tower, Mr Maeda sub­mit­ted a pe­ti­tion to Tokyo Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike, but met with a dead end there.</p>
    <p>While he has not found a Ja­panese de­vel­oper keen to pre­serve the site, he is turn­ing his at­ten­tion over­seas, hop­ing to en­tice some­one who will buy out the cap­sule own­ers and carry out struc­tural up­grades while re­tain­ing the build­ing’s fa­cade.</p>
    <p>If it lasts that long, the build­ing will turn 50 in two years, when it will qual­ify to be reg­is­tered as a cul­tural prop­erty.</p>
    <p>But even that may not be enough to se­cure its fu­ture. In the nearby city of Fun­abashi in Chiba pre­fec­ture, the Ta­m­a­gawa Ryokan inn, built in 1921 and reg­is­tered as a cul­tural prop­erty, is be­ing torn down after its own­ers went out of business this year.</p>
