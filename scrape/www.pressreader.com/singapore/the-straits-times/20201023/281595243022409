    <p>Do­na­tions to char­i­ties reached a 10-year high of $2.9 bil­lion in 2018, ac­cord­ing to the re­cently re­leased Com­mis­sioner of Char­i­ties 2019 an­nual re­port. Com­mis­sioner Ang Hak Seng at­trib­uted the record do­na­tions largely to in­creases in do­na­tions in the ed­u­ca­tion, re­li­gious, so­cial and wel­fare sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Do­na­tions to char­i­ties reached a 10-year high of $2.9 bil­lion in 2018, be­fore the coro­n­avirus un­leashed chaos all over the world and put the brakes on many fund-rais­ing events this year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the re­cently re­leased Com­mis­sioner of Char­i­ties (COC) 2019 an­nual re­port, do­na­tions to char­i­ties rose by 8 per cent from $2.7 bil­lion in 2017 to $2.9 bil­lion in 2018.</p>
    <p>Com­mis­sioner Ang Hak Seng told The Straits Times that this $2.9 bil­lion is the high­est in the past decade – about 60 per cent more than the $1.8 bil­lion col­lected in 2009.</p>
    <p>Dr Ang at­trib­uted the record do­na­tions in 2018 largely to in­creases in do­na­tions in the ed­u­ca­tion, re­li­gious, so­cial and wel­fare sec­tors.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the New Creation Church col­lected $112 mil­lion in do­na­tions in 2017.</p>
    <p>This rose to $122 mil­lion in 2018 and $126 mil­lion last year, ac­cord­ing to The Straits Times’ check of fi­nan­cial re­ports on the COC web­site.</p>
    <p>A church spokesman said the do­na­tions were tithes and of­fer­ings from its mem­bers and “a di­rect re­sult of the church reach­ing more peo­ple than ever be­fore”.</p>
    <p>One of Sin­ga­pore’s most suc­cess­ful fund-raisers is the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In its fi­nan­cial year that ended in March this year, it col­lected $150 mil­lion in do­na­tions. This was a fall from the $214 mil­lion col­lected in its fi­nan­cial year that ended in March last year and the $227 mil­lion in its fi­nan­cial year that ended in March 2018.</p>
    <p>At end-De­cem­ber last year, there were 2,281 reg­is­tered char­i­ties, ac­cord­ing to the COC an­nual re­port re­leased late last month.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious groups, such as churches and tem­ples, made up close to half of them.</p>
    <p>The other char­i­ties in­cluded those in the so­cial and wel­fare sec­tor, health, arts and her­itage and sports.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, there were only 21 newly reg­is­tered char­i­ties last year, com­pared with 40 in 2018 and 39 in 2017.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the num­ber of char­i­ties reg­is­tered is ex­pected to fluc­tu­ate from year to year, Dr Ang said: “Over the years, we have con­ducted more public ed­u­ca­tion to raise the aware­ness of reg­is­tra­tion re­quire­ments and en­hance the un­der­stand­ing of reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments for char­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kwan Jin Yao, who runs so­cialser­vice.sg, a news­let­ter on so­cial ser­vice re­search in Sin­ga­pore, said the record do­na­tions in 2018 could be due to greater gen­eros­ity.</p>
    <p>He cal­cu­lated that each per­son here gave $361 to char­ity in 2009 and this rose to $509 in 2018.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers in­ter­viewed said the emer­gence of on­line do­na­tion plat­forms, such as giv­ing.sg, may have also boosted giv­ing to char­ity in the past decade.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with the cir­cuit breaker and safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to stem the spread of Covid-19, forc­ing many large-scale fund-raisers to be can­celled or post­poned this year, Dr</p>
    <p>Ang ex­pects do­na­tions to be lower this year: “The Covid-19 pan­demic has ad­versely im­pacted many char­i­ties’ op­er­a­tions, as well as the abil­ity of or­gan­i­sa­tions and in­di­vid­u­als to do­nate as much as they used to.”</p>
    <p>The SPD, for ex­am­ple, saw do­na­tions drop by nearly 40 per cent in April and May com­pared with the same months last year.</p>
    <p>The char­ity help­ing peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties had to turn to on­line fund-raisers, such as or­gan­is­ing a vir­tual flag day and an up­com­ing vir­tual walk/run, as phys­i­cal events were can­celled.</p>
    <p>But not all char­i­ties had gloomy news to re­port.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the St John’s Home for El­derly Per­sons raised $1.9 mil­lion in do­na­tions in the first eight months of this year, al­most dou­ble the $1 mil­lion in the same pe­riod last year. Its chair­man Woon Wee Yim said this is be­cause do­na­tions through on­line plat­forms, such as giv­ing.sg, have in­creased.</p>
    <p>The char­ity used to hold an an­nual fund-rais­ing gala din­ner but had to can­cel this year’s due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, it held its first vir­tual gala din­ner where donors bought restau­rant meals which were de­liv­ered to their fam­ily or friends. It raised about $320,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Woon said: “Now we fo­cus more ef­fort on on­line fund-rais­ing. The on­line do­na­tions are very en­cour­ag­ing.”</p>
    <p>MANY FUND-RAISERS CAN­CELLED The Covid-19 pan­demic has ad­versely im­pacted many char­i­ties’ op­er­a­tions, as well as the abil­ity of or­gan­i­sa­tions and in­di­vid­u­als to do­nate as much as they used to. MR ANG HAK SENG, Com­mis­sioner of Char­i­ties, who ex­pects do­na­tions to be lower this year.</p>
