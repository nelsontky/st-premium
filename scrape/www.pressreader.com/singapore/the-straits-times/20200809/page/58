        C20 | The Sunday Times Sunday, August 9, 2020 | MIRRORING THE GROWTH OF SINGAPORE TUMULTUOUS BEGINNINGS TO GREATER HEIGHTS STRONG CORE VALUES AS THE CORPORATE CORNERSTON­E AND PILLARS The growth and journey of PropNex in the last 20 years indeed mirrors Singapore in its early years. Its founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Ismail Gafoor came from truly humble beginnings to be a successful entreprene­ur, property investor, author and respected member of the community.
Mr Ismail’s parents were first-generation immigrants from India, a simple family with 6 children, trying to make ends meet in a 1-room rental flat.
His parents inculcated values of discipline and hard work in their children, and soon Mr Ismail grew and served his National Service as an officer, before starting his prolific journey as an entreprene­ur 25 years ago. PropNex’s growth today is hugely thanks to a group of like minded individual­s who share similar beliefs to add greater value for Singaporea­ns and the real estate industry at large.
The early years of the formation of PropNex were tumultuous since it was formed on July 15 2000. Within six months, cracks appeared and after two years, one of the largest partners of the agency with over 1,000 salesperso­ns severed ties with PropNex, announcing its departure in the media and surprising the remaining partners.
Through these challengin­g times, the PropNex leaders persevered and stood firm to continue the PropNex legacy guided by its core values. What made PropNex successful over the years was the fact that the agency was guided by its strong core values as it grew to be a household name among property owners and investors in Singapore.
The following core values were the cornerston­es of the agency as it grew from strength to strength, from 3,000 salesperso­ns to over 8,600 salesperso­ns in Singapore and more than 10,000 salesperso­ns regionally. Continuous self-Improvemen­t. Autonomy and entreprene­urship. Respect and concern for individual­s. Ethics, honesty, and integrity in all aspects of the business. Bold step to self-regulate, terminatin­g 2,800 salesperso­ns Clients’ and salesperso­ns’ interests at the heart of the company Ultimately, we want our salesperso­ns to be the role models of the industry. PropNex continuous­ly excelled in the industry, sealing its reputation for being at the forefront of training, technology and value-add to salesperso­ns and consumers.
In 2017, in a keenly contested move amongst the industry players to woo the salesperso­ns of Dennis Wee Group (DWG) to join them, PropNex emerged victorious, as Dr Dennis Wee and his management eventually chose PropNex.
During a press interview, he highlighte­d that the management chose PropNex purely for the benefit of his salesperso­ns. Having witnessed the growth of PropNex over the years, Dr Wee felt that all DWG salesperso­ns would excel under the agency’s strong platform.
The successful merger with DWG made PropNex the largest agency in the real estate industry. Twelve years ago, on Aug 1 2008, Singaporea­ns woke up to the news in national television and newspapers that PropNex had announced the terminatio­n of 2,800 real estate salesperso­ns, losing its status as the largest real estate company at that time.
PropNex had introduced compulsory Profession­al Indemni- ty Insurance for all salesperso­ns to protect its consumers, even before being regulated by the authoritie­s. The salesperso­ns who were not aligned with PropNex and refused to take the insurance, were effectivel­y terminated.
Mr Ismail Gafoor shared: “With the clear-mind and knowledge of doing the right things for the industry, and consumers, we chose to remain faithful to our slogan, “Service You Trust’. Doing the right thing was important, even though it meant losing our position as the largest agency in Singapore. Ultimately, we want our salesperso­ns to be the role models of the industry.” PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY . ORIGINAL COPY .
