    <p>Hawker Lee Fook Choi en­cour­ages his cus­tomers to go cash­less when pay­ing for the herbal tea at his stall, not­ing how they would not need to look for small change if they sim­ply scanned the QR code on the wall.</p>
    <p>Just a month ago, how­ever, the 75-year-old, who has had a stall at Chi­na­town Com­plex Food Cen­tre for the past four decades, did not even know it was pos­si­ble to re­ceive pay­ments in this man­ner.</p>
    <p>“I use my phone to stay in touch with my friends on What­sApp and to make calls, but I didn’t know that the phone can do so much more,” he said in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>“Old peo­ple like me have to be taught how to do these things.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee learnt about the sys­tem when dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors stopped by his stall to pro­mote its use, as part of the Govern­ment’s broad dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts un­der the Hawk­ers Go Dig­i­tal scheme.</p>
    <p>Launched in June, the scheme aims to help Singapore’s 18,000 stall­hold­ers in wet mar­kets and hawker cen­tres adopt the uni­fied Singapore Quick Re­sponse Code (SGQR) e-pay­ment so­lu­tion by the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>The SGQR, in­tro­duced in Septem­ber 2018, is a sin­gle QR code that com­bines mul­ti­ple e-pay­ment so­lu­tions into one.</p>
    <p>Hawk­ers who sign up for SGQR un­der the scheme are eli­gi­ble for a bonus of $300 a month – up to a cu­mu­la­tive $1,500 – if they log at least 20 trans­ac­tions of more than $1 each in a month.</p>
    <p>Trans­ac­tions un­der this ini­tia­tive must be com­pleted by May 31 next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee is among the 1,900 stall­hold­ers who have gone dig­i­tal with e-pay­ments over the past two months, bring­ing the to­tal in Singapore to 5,400.</p>
    <p>He said: “Peo­ple think se­niors are not open to new tech­nol­ogy, but that’s not true. We just don’t un­der­stand how these things work. But as long as some­one shows us, we’re open to learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>Plans are un­der way to ed­u­cate se­niors on dig­i­tal de­vices and ap­pli­ca­tions at SG Dig­i­tal com­mu­nity hubs is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>At these hubs in com­mu­nity cen­tres and pub­lic li­braries, res­i­dents can learn how to use com­mon mo</p>
    <p>GUID­ANCE NEEDED I use my phone to stay in touch with my friends on What­sApp and to make calls, but I didn’t know that the phone can do so much more. Old peo­ple like me have to be taught how to do ’’ these things. MR LEE FOOK CHOI, 75, who has had a herbal tea stall at Chi­na­town Com­plex Food Cen­tre for four decades.</p>
    <p>bile apps such as What­sApp and SingPass Mo­bile in one-to-one ses­sions with dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Siew Leong, 73, who runs a por­ridge stall in Chi­na­town Com­plex Food Cen­tre, was one of the early adopters of the SGQR so­lu­tion, hav­ing had it set up since De­cem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>He has seen a no­tice­able change</p>
    <p>IT’S CATCH­ING ON Last year, most of my cus­tomers who used it were from China. Sin­ga­pore­ans al­ways tend to use cash, but now the younger ones ’’ know how to use the sys­tem. MR LIM SIEW LEONG, 73, who runs a por­ridge stall also in Chi­na­town Com­plex Food Cen­tre and is an early adopter of the SGQR e-pay­ment so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>in re­cent months. More Sin­ga­pore­ans are us­ing it to make pay­ments, he said.</p>
    <p>“Last year, most of my cus­tomers who used it were from China.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans al­ways tend to use cash, but now the younger ones know how to use the sys­tem,” he said in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>China is known for be­ing a cash­less so­ci­ety, with large seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion pre­fer­ring to use dig­i­tal pay­ment sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim added: “I tell my se­nior cus­tomers to try it out as well, but they ei­ther do not have de­vices that can scan QR codes, or their phones are not linked to their bank ac­counts.”</p>
    <p>Still, the re­cent rise in cash­less trans­ac­tions at his stall is en­cour­ag­ing. From get­ting a hand­ful of cash­less trans­ac­tions every cou­ple of months last year, he has been log­ging more than 20 such trans­ac­tions each month this year.</p>
    <p>“It’s con­ve­nient for ev­ery­one. I can see all the trans­ac­tions com­ing in at one go too,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has ramped up ef­forts this year to pro­mote dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion amid the eco­nomic and so­cial dis­rup­tion brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They in­clude help­ing stall­hold­ers to min­imise phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion with cus­tomers and the han­dling of cash.</p>
