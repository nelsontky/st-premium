    <p>A mo­bile phone seller has be­come the first per­son here to be con­victed of fail­ing to reg­is­ter for goods and ser­vices tax (GST) for on­line sales.</p>
    <p>Ed­win Pang Chung Jie, 40, was yes­ter­day or­dered to pay a penalty of more than $11,000.</p>
    <p>The first per­son to be con­victed of fail­ing to reg­is­ter for goods and ser­vices tax (GST) for on­line sales has been or­dered to pay a penalty of over $11,000.</p>
    <p>Ed­win Pang Chung Jie, 40, was also fined $4,000 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He had pleaded guilty to one charge un­der the Goods and Ser­vices Tax Act.</p>
    <p>Four other charges were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing sen­tenc­ing by Dis­trict Judge Ong Luan Tze.</p>
    <p>Two were for sub­mit­ting in­cor­rect in­come tax re­turns with­out rea­son­able ex­cuse and the other two re­lated to fail­ing to keep proper records of the in­voices he re­ceived linked to his busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Oct 30, the In­land Rev­enue Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (Iras) said Pang sold mo­bile phones and ac­ces­sories on on­line plat­forms such as Lazada, Shopee and Carousell.</p>
    <p>He con­ducted his business through, among oth­ers, two firms he solely owned, Ed­mo­bile and Moogi, tax pros­e­cu­tor Vic­to­ria Chong told the court.</p>
    <p>“In­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that the to­tal value of the ac­cused’s tax­able sup­plies for the four quar­ters ended Dec 31, 2012, to Sept 30, 2013, had ex­ceeded $1 mil­lion,” she said.</p>
    <p>Pang was there­fore re­quired to no­tify the Comptrolle­r of GST of his li­a­bil­ity to be reg­is­tered for GST by Oct 30, 2013.</p>
    <p>But he failed to do so, re­sult­ing in $118,023.23 of tax be­ing due for the pe­riod be­tween Dec 1, 2013, and Sept 30, 2015.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Pang, who is bank­rupt, has since made par­tial resti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Dis­trict Judge Ong even­tu­ally sen­tenced him to the fine and or­dered him to pay a penalty of $11,802.32.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, Iras said that be­tween 2015 and last year, it re­cov­ered more than $3.8 mil­lion in taxes and penal­ties from 65 au­dit cases on tax­pay­ers who op­er­ate on­line busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>It said that all in­come from on­line and e-com­merce busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore must be re­ported for tax pur­poses.</p>
    <p>“In­di­vid­u­als, sole pro­pri­etors or part­ners of a part­ner­ship who are in re­ceipt of more than $6,000 in an­nual net business in­come in the cur­rent year will be re­quired to file a tax re­turn for the year of as­sess­ment 2021 dur­ing the tax fil­ing pe­riod from March 1 to April 18, 2021,” it added.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees who separately earn ad­di­tional in­come from run­ning an on­line business on the side will also have to de­clare such in­come un­der the “Trade, Business, Pro­fes­sion or Vo­ca­tion” sec­tion in their in­di­vid­ual in­come tax re­turns, it said.</p>
    <p>In its ear­lier state­ment, Iras said that be­tween 2015 and last year, it re­cov­ered more than $3.8 mil­lion in taxes and penal­ties from 65 au­dit cases on tax­pay­ers who op­er­ate on­line busi­nesses. It said that all in­come from on­line and e-com­merce busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore must be re­ported for tax pur­poses.</p>
