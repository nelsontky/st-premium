    <p>FIC­TION THE SI­LENCE</p>
    <p>By Don DeLillo</p>
    <p>Pan Macmil­lan/Hard­cover/116 pages/ $30.94/Books Ki­noku­niya</p>
    <p>Noth­ing much hap­pens in The Si­lence, which skips the usual dystopian fod­der of so­ci­etal may­hem in a tech­no­log­i­cal wipe-out and, de­spite its ti­tle, is ex­traor­di­nar­ily talky.</p>
    <p>The ab­sur­dist, some­what ex­per­i­men­tal work clocks in at just 116 pages, its sparse yet re­fined writ­ing bet­ter suited to dis­sec­tion in lit­er­a­ture classes than breezy, ca­sual read­ing.</p>
    <p>It fea­tures deep mus­ings and non-se­quiturs about the mean­ing of life, told through con­ver­sa­tions about Ro­man palazzo ceil­ings, Ein­stein’s the­ory of rel­a­tiv­ity and cryp­tocur­ren­cies that take a li­bid­i­nal turn.</p>
    <p>Don DeLillo, the pro­lific 84-yearold Amer­i­can lit­er­ary mae­stro, in­fuses a sense of dark com­edy into his 18th novel, which is pre­scient enough to fore­see “the face masks, the city streets emp­tied out” de­spite be­ing com­pleted be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Si­lence fol­lows the ex­is­ten­tial crises of five people af­ter ma­chines sud­denly stop work­ing all at once, right be­fore kick-off on Su­per Bowl Sun­day night in 2022 (the Ten­nessee Ti­tans ver­sus the Seat­tle Sea­hawks, by DeLillo’s pre­dic­tion).</p>
    <p>Planes drop out of the sky, tele­vi­sion screens go dark and mo­bile de­vices turn into life­less pa­per­weights. Is it a power grid fail­ure? The Chi­nese hi­jack­ing the game in a “se­lec­tive In­ter­net apoc­a­lypse”? An elec­tro­mag­netic dis­rup­tion? An alien at­tack?</p>
    <p>The frenzy of spec­u­la­tion brings no an­swers and the char­ac­ters grad­u­ally lose their grip on re­al­ity amid the bore­dom and para­noia.</p>
    <p>Jim Kripps, an in­surance claims ad­juster ob­sessed with num­bers, and his wife Tessa Berens, a poet fix­ated on minu­tiae, are on a long­haul flight back to New York af­ter a hol­i­day in Paris.</p>
    <p>Their plan af­ter land­ing is to high-tail it to the Man­hat­tan home of their friends – build­ing in­spec­tor Max Sten­ner and re­tired physics teacher Diane Lu­cas – to watch the Su­per Bowl game. Round­ing out the group is Martin Dekker, one of Diane’s for­mer stu­dents.</p>
    <p>The plane crashes at about the same time the tele­vi­sion screen goes dark. Jim and Tessa es­cape shaken but rel­a­tively un­scathed, and, to mark “their sur­vival and the depth of their con­nec­tion”, have sex in a hos­pi­tal bath­room stall be­fore walk­ing to their friends’ home.</p>
    <p>Max has waged huge stakes on the game and, to the be­muse­ment of Diane and Martin, em­barks on a so­lil­o­quy to fill the void. He nar­rates what he imag­ines to be un­fold­ing on the blank screen – right down to mim­ick­ing a com­mer­cial.</p>
    <p>The high-brow Martin spews words such as thau­ma­tol­ogy, on­tol­ogy, es­cha­tol­ogy and epis­te­mol­ogy in the same sen­tence. This hits the right but­tons with Diane, now aim­less af­ter early re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>The con­ver­sa­tions are not quite co­her­ent. Are they liv­ing in a “makeshift re­al­ity... a fu­ture that isn’t sup­posed to take form just yet”? Is the dig­i­tal black­out a “ca­sual em­brace that marks the fall of world civil­i­sa­tion”?</p>
    <p>No­body talks like that, but in DeLillo’s world, un­moored from its clock­work re­liance on tech­nol­ogy, his char­ac­ters fall into a trance and sleep­walk to­wards the hor­rors of a dig­i­tal vac­uum.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Leave The World Be­hind by Ru­maan Alam (Blooms­bury, 2020, $29.95, Books Ki­noku­niya). An af­flu­ent fam­ily on va­ca­tion at a rented hol­i­day home are sur­prised by a cou­ple who claim to be the home own­ers, as a dig­i­tal dooms­day event cuts them off from the wider world.</p>
