    <p>MANILA • The Philip­pines’ For­eign Min­is­ter or­dered the coun­try’s mis­sion to the United Na­tions yes­ter­day to vote for China’s can­di­date to fill one of five seats at the In­ter­na­tional Court of Jus­tice (ICJ) that will be­come va­cant next year.</p>
    <p>“You are in­structed to cast the Philip­pine vote for the Chi­nese can­di­date to the In­ter­na­tional Court of Jus­tice. That is your only clear in­struc­tion,” For­eign Af­fairs Sec­re­tary Teodoro Loc­sin said on Twit­ter, with­out elab­o­rat­ing.</p>
    <p>Four of the eight can­di­dates con­test­ing the five po­si­tions are in­cum­bent judges whose nine-year terms are due to ex­pire on Feb 5 next year.</p>
    <p>One of the four is Chi­nese judge Xue Han­qin, who is also the vicepres­i­dent of the ICJ, also known as the World Court.</p>
    <p>The ICJ, the high­est United Na­tions court for in­ter-state dis­putes, is com­posed of 15 judges elected to nine-year terms of of­fice by the UN Gen­eral Assem­bly and Se­cu­rity Coun­cil. Judges are el­i­gi­ble for re­elec­tion.</p>
    <p>A UN doc­u­ment dated June 29 showed that the Philip­pines had nom­i­nated an­other can­di­date, Ja­panese judge Yuji Iwa­sawa, but not Judge Xue.</p>
    <p>The For­eign Min­istry said the Philip­pines can sup­port more than one can­di­date at Wed­nes­day’s election as there will be five va­can­cies.</p>
    <p>Since com­ing to power in 2016, Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte has pur­sued closer re­la­tions with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, much of the rest of the Philip­pines, par­tic­u­larly its mil­i­tary, has har­boured a deep mis­trust of China over what it sees as in­tru­sions into its ter­ri­tory, bul­ly­ing of its fish­er­men and de­nial of ac­cess to its en­ergy re­sources.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, Mr Duterte’s govern­ment has started to shift back to­wards the United States – which re­mains widely pop­u­lar among Filipinos – as Bei­jing has in­creased its as­sertive­ness in the South China Sea and the Philip­pine econ­omy has suf­fered due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
