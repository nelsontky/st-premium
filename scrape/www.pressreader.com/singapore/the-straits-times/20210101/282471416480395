    <p>The UK can be very proud to have a cham­pion and am­bas­sador of the cal­i­bre of Sir Lewis Hamil­ton.</p>
    <p>MERCEDES F1 TEAM PRIN­CI­PAL, on the knight­hood for his driver Lewis Hamil­ton</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s male dis­tance run­ners have made their mark in the re­gion in re­cent years, with Mok Ying Ren and Soh Rui Yong win­ning three con­sec­u­tive golds from 2013 (Mok) to 2017.</p>
    <p>But their fe­male coun­ter­parts have lagged be­hind and while they stepped up to com­pete at the bi­en­nial SEA Games, Sin­ga­pore’s last women’s marathon medal was Toh Soh Liang’s bronze at the 1997 Jakarta edi­tion.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic’s only gold medal in the women’s event was K. Jaya­mani’s in 1983. In the last decade, the best re­sult was Jas­mine Goh’s fourth plac­ing at the 2017 Games in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>OTHER PRI­OR­I­TIES</p>
    <p>Why is there a dis­par­ity in re­sults be­tween the men and women?</p>
    <p>Vet­eran dis­tance run­ning coach Ghana Se­garan told The Straits Times: “Only two can go to the SEA Games. To reach that level, it takes a lot of train­ing, com­mit­ment and sac­ri­fice.</p>
    <p>“Most of our women ath­letes are not full-time ath­letes, to ex­pect them to train at that level is a bit tough.</p>
    <p>“But if they are com­mit­ted enough and can take a year or two for full-time train­ing, I’m sure they will also be­come podium win­ners even­tu­ally.”</p>
    <p>Therein lies the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Risk man­ager Ser­ena Teoh, 33, who com­peted in the 2019 SEA Games, noted: “In gen­eral, marathons tend to at­tract peo­ple of a more ma­ture age group – those in their late 20s to 40s. At this age, most women have fam­i­lies and full-time jobs so one would have to bal­ance all this.”</p>
    <p>When Goh, 41, was train­ing for the SEA Games, she put in eight ses­sions a week which lasted about 90 min­utes each, ex­cept for long runs on week­ends of two to three hours.</p>
    <p>The mother of two said: “A good marathoner av­er­ages 100km to 120km every week and if you break that down, it’s run­ning every day. It takes a lot of sac­ri­fice to be good at it and some may not be will­ing to com­mit and put those hours in.”</p>
    <p>OVER­SEAS OP­POR­TU­NI­TIES</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore stages two mar­quee marathons a year – the Osim Sun­down Marathon and Stan­dard Char­tered Sin­ga­pore Marathon (SCSM).</p>
    <p>This, and the coun­try’s hot and hu­mid weather, tend to prompt elite marathon­ers to go over­seas to com­pete and train.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Mok trained in Ja­pan be­fore win­ning gold at the 2013 SEA Games, while Soh had stints in Flagstaff, Ari­zona, ahead of win­ning the 2015 and 2017 Games marathons.</p>
    <p>But not ev­ery­one can af­ford the time or money to do so.</p>
    <p>Goh, a fi­nan­cial plan­ner who clocked her qual­i­fy­ing time at the 2017 Hong Kong Marathon, said: “It’s al­most im­pos­si­ble to qual­ify for any­thing in Sin­ga­pore and we mainly run our qual­i­fy­ing times in cooler cli­mates, which means we need to fly and some may not have the means to do that.”</p>
    <p>Former na­tional dis­tance run­ner Elan­go­van Gane­san, who was the SCSM men’s lo­cal cham­pion from 2004 to 2006, lamented the lack of op­por­tu­ni­ties and called for more sup­port, not­ing: “What about those who can’t af­ford to go over­seas or can’t miss school or work?</p>
    <p>“We might be miss­ing out on some tal­ented peo­ple so at the end of the day, we have to or­gan­ise some­thing here for those who can’t go over­seas.”</p>
    <p>Ghana noted that the ideal age to start train­ing for marathons is the late 20s to early 30s as the in­ten­sity of train­ing “takes a toll on the body” and “can stunt some growth, es­pe­cially if you’re a teenager”.</p>
    <p>But a path­way would have to be laid out to fa­cil­i­tate the tran­si­tion from mid-long dis­tance in schools to marathons.</p>
    <p>The max­i­mum dis­tance of­fered at the Na­tional School Games is the 3.8km cross coun­try for girls in the A, B and C Di­vi­sions, while the In­sti­tute-Var­sity-Polytech­nic Games’ long­est for women is 10,000m.</p>
    <p>Ghana, 66, said: “If they run 5,000m as a teenager, there must be a plat­form for them to move onto marathons.</p>
    <p>“It’ll be a different chal­lenge al­to­gether be­cause run­ning a marathon takes a cou­ple of hours and it can be very drain­ing. So guid­ance on how to con­di­tion them­selves to run a marathon and re­cover is very im­por­tant.”</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, it also de­pends on the will of the in­di­vid­ual ath­letes, said Elan­go­van, who coaches ath­letes like Teoh and schools such as Nan Hua High School and St An­drew’s Sec­ondary School.</p>
    <p>He said: “(Go­ing over­seas to train) is a per­sonal choice. If men can choose to do that, the women can too but maybe they’re tied up by per­sonal rea­sons.”</p>
    <p>MORE WOMEN-ONLY RACES?</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age more women to race com­pet­i­tively, he sug­gested or­gan­is­ing more races here for them to give them ex­po­sure and to pro­vide top fin­ish­ers the op­por­tu­nity to com­pete over­seas.</p>
    <p>Elan­go­van, 45, said: “It’ll be eye­open­ing for them be­cause they get to see that women in other coun­tries are faster than our men and that’s where they get en­cour­aged and mo­ti­vated to start train­ing</p>
    <p>TOTO WOLFF com­pet­i­tively.”</p>
    <p>Civil ser­vant Yvonne Chee, 40, who started run­ning com­pet­i­tively in 2016, said women-only runs are a great place to start in terms of en­cour­ag­ing women to take it the sport more se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>“They have an amaz­ing at­mos­phere around them and we cel­e­brate women of all ages and back­grounds. It cre­ates a bond among women and I be­lieve that en­cour­ages many women to take the first step to run,” said the three-time par­tic­i­pant of the Great East­ern Women’s Run (GEWR), who was third in the half-marathon elite closed cat­e­gory in 2019.</p>
    <p>The GEWR typ­i­cally at­tracts 14,000 run­ners and fea­tures cat­e­gories rang­ing from 5km to 21km.</p>
    <p>Goh sug­gested that the event can also tai­lor cat­e­gories specif­i­cally for teenagers to ex­pose them to mid-long dis­tance run­ning.</p>
    <p>TIME IS EV­ERY­THING</p>
    <p>Most of our women ath­letes are not full-time ath­letes, to ex­pect them to train at that level is a bit tough. But if they are com­mit­ted enough and can take a year or two for full-time train­ing, I’m sure they will also be­come podium win­ners even­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>GHANA SE­GARAN, vet­eran dis­tance run­ning coach.</p>
    <p>DE­TER­MI­NA­TION</p>
    <p>A good marathoner av­er­ages 100km to 120km every week and if you break that down, it’s run­ning every day. It takes a lot of sac­ri­fice to be good at it and some may not be will­ing to com­mit and put those hours in.</p>
    <p>JAS­MINE GOH, who was fourth at the 2017 Games.</p>
    <p>SHARED PAS­SION</p>
    <p>It cre­ates a bond among women and I be­lieve that en­cour­ages many women to take the first step to run.</p>
    <p>YVONNE CHEE,</p>
    <p>on the im­por­tance of women-only runs.</p>
    <p>She added: “They have to start some­where and the GEWR is a good place be­cause they can run with fel­low fe­male run­ners and not feel pres­sured.</p>
    <p>“The 15- to 18-year-olds are still ac­tive and do­ing a lot of sports so they would be keen. If you have that kind of op­por­tu­nity to reach out to that age group to get them hooked on that dis­tance, there’s a bet­ter chance of them ex­plor­ing and ex­pand­ing that dis­tance.”</p>
    <p>Goh also noted that role mod­els play an im­por­tant part and said: “What I try to do is I’ll share my story when I can be­cause a lot of girls will be con­cerned about man­ag­ing fam­ily, work and run­ning.</p>
    <p>“If they hear my story, maybe it can inspire them. I’m not say­ing it’s easy but it’s pos­si­ble if they truly want it.”</p>
