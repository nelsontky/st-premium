    <p>Only the day be­fore, he had put his name on a list to vol­un­teer for med­i­cal re­in­force­ments in Wuhan, the cen­tral Chi­nese city in the grip of an un­known virus.</p>
    <p>When the call came on Jan 27, the third day of the Chi­nese New Year, Bei­jing in­ten­sive care physi­cian Liu Zhuang felt a mix of emo­tions – an­tic­i­pa­tion and anx­i­ety – as the adren­a­line coursed through him.</p>
    <p>“The sever­ity of the virus, how the dis­ease would be­have, and the ex­act con­di­tion of the pa­tients we were fac­ing, we had no idea,” Dr Liu said. “It was with a lot of ner­vous­ness and un­knowns that we de­parted for Wuhan.”</p>
    <p>His wife, a home­maker, and their 10-year-old son barely had time to re­act to the news be­fore he had to go: Vol­un­teer doc­tors and nurses were given two hours to re­port to the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>“From the time we got the no­tice to pack... to the time we ar­rived at the air­port to leave for Wuhan was about six hours,” the 39-year-old told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Days ear­lier, Wuhan had been put un­der a strict lock­down to con­tain the virus, be­lieved to have first sur­faced at a mar­ket.</p>
    <p>But the scale of the out­break had been down­played and was slowly be­com­ing clear in the im­ages of over­whelmed hos­pi­tals, near-hys­ter­i­cal pa­tients and over­worked med­i­cal staff that flooded so­cial me­dia, prompt­ing the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment to re­di­rect med­i­cal per­son­nel and re­sources from around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Dr Liu was part of a 138-strong re­in­force­ment team from a col­lec­tive of Bei­jing hos­pi­tals which con­sisted of nurs­ing staff, doc­tors and two ad­min­is­tra­tors. When the team landed in Wuhan late that night, the usu­ally bustling city was de­serted as their char­tered bus raced through streets still decked out with Chi­nese New Year dec­o­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“On the bus, my feel­ings were a lot more com­plex too be­cause we didn’t know what to ex­pect the next day,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ap­pointed one of sev­eral op­er­a­tions co­or­di­na­tors, his first task was to re­or­gan­ise the work­flow of the Wuhan Union Hos­pi­tal by sep­a­rat­ing the build­ing into clean and con­tam­i­nated zones.</p>
    <p>But his clearly de­fined du­ties aside, he and the oth­ers could not help feel­ing over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>“We felt the big­gest pres­sure in the first two weeks be­cause the cases we saw were far more se­vere, and the backup med­i­cal sup­plies had not ar­rived,” he said.</p>
    <p>Though some medics were work­ing to the point of ex­haus­tion, Dr Liu said his team was care­ful to work in ro­ta­tions of six- to eight-hour shifts to en­sure that ev­ery­one got enough rest.</p>
    <p>Still, be­set by anx­i­ety, many team mem­bers could not sleep at night. He found the quiet mo­ments hard­est, af­ter a pun­ish­ing day at work, when he was alone in his ho­tel room and even a sim­ple let­ter from home could make him emo­tional.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing a boy, my son doesn’t re­ally talk about his feel­ings but he wrote me a let­ter telling me to take care of my­self at work, that school had started vir­tual classes, and that ev­ery­thing was fine at home. I was very touched,” Dr Liu said.</p>
    <p>The team spent 65 days in Wuhan, treat­ing 345 pa­tients in their unit. They felt a gamut of emo­tions, cel­e­brat­ing each re­cov­ery, and ral­ly­ing to­gether when­ever a pa­tient died.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day, China had re­ported 90,934 coro­n­avirus in­fec</p>
    <p>tions and 4,745 deaths. Most of th­ese stemmed from Wuhan and the sur­round­ing Hubei prov­ince in the ear­lier half of the year.</p>
    <p>The coun­try largely re­opened to in­ter-pro­vin­cial travel by May, even though Wuhan saw a brief sec­ond wave of cases that month, which led to the au­thor­i­ties or­der­ing the en­tire city of 11 mil­lion to un­dergo nu­cleic acid test­ing.</p>
    <p>Cities like Bei­jing, north China’s Dalian and Urumqi in the west also had sec­ond out­breaks that were quickly put un­der con­trol with a com­bi­na­tion of move­ment re­stric­tions and mass test­ing.</p>
    <p>While there are still about a dozen new cases re­ported daily, most are im­ported as China grad­u­ally re­opens its bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Much of the na­tion’s suc­cess in bat­tling the virus comes down to the abil­ity to di­rect large amounts of re­sources to the worst af­fected ar­eas, but it is also the will­ing­ness of the en­tire coun­try to work to­gether that has helped get the dis­ease un­der con</p>
    <p>trol, said Dr Liu.</p>
    <p>“I feel that go­ing for­ward, we still need med­i­cal staff, re­searchers and sci­en­tists to work hard to­gether to un­cover the na­ture of this virus, to even bet­ter un­der­stand how it de­vel­ops so we can bet­ter treat our pa­tients,” he said.</p>
    <p>And while China ap­pears to have suc­cess­fully con­tained the virus for now, it can­not be com­pla­cent as the global war has not been won, he noted.</p>
    <p>“What we know about the dis­ease is still very lit­tle and lim­ited,” he said.</p>
