    <p>Booths have been in­stalled at 170 clin­ics to bol­ster safety for doc­tors, clinic staff and their pa­tients dur­ing swab tests.</p>
    <p>The clin­ics are part of a 900-wide net­work of Pub­lic Health Pre­pared­ness Clin­ics spread across the is­land, out of which 400 are equipped to al­low any­one aged 13 and above di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion symp­toms to get tested for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors say the light­weight Cosmo-Slim, on trial for about a month now, makes swab­bing more con­ve­nient for pa­tients as they can get tested at a clinic near them and do not have to travel to other test­ing cen­tres.</p>
    <p>This also helps to keep the com­mu­nity safe, they added.</p>
    <p>Swab booths are now lo­cated at 170 clin­ics is­land­wide to al­low test­ing for those show­ing signs of Covid-19 in­fec­tion, while guard­ing the safety of gen­eral prac­ti­tion­ers, clinic staff and other pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The move is in line with the na­tional ef­fort to ramp up Sin­ga­pore’s test­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The clin­ics are part of a net­work of 900 Pub­lic Health Pre­pared­ness Clin­ics (PHPCs), of which 400 are equipped to al­low any­one aged 13 and above di­ag­nosed with acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion (ARI) symp­toms to get tested for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health had pre­vi­ously said the strat­egy is to test ev­ery­one di­ag­nosed with ARI once there is suf­fi­cient test­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The swab booths, built us­ing an alu­minium frame and poly­car­bon­ate pan­els, are light­weight and mo­bile. They were de­vel­oped by lo­cal en­gi­neer­ing com­pany ATC, and spon­sored by Te­masek Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Known as Cosmo-Slim, they have been on trial since end-July to equip PHPCs with safe and ef­fec­tive mo­bile swab­bing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, said Te­masek Foun­da­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Ng Boon Heong.</p>
    <p>He added that the booths al­low the 170 clin­ics to be bet­ter pro­tected while swab­bing pa­tients with ARI symp­toms, with­out hav­ing to send them to other places.</p>
    <p>Swab tests are also avail­able at re­gional screen­ing cen­tres, a net­work that the Health Pro­mo­tion</p>
    <p>Board is ex­pand­ing.</p>
    <p>With test­ing ca­pac­i­ties en­hanced, the load on other fa­cil­i­ties such as hos­pi­tals will be less­ened, said doc­tors.</p>
    <p>Dr Teo Boon See, who was among the GPs who helped in the design of the booth, said hav­ing one at her Camry Med­i­cal Cen­tre clinic in Toa Payoh Lorong 4 makes swab­bing more con­ve­nient for her pa­tients, while en­sur­ing the safety of the staff in­volved.</p>
    <p>“Some­times, pa­tients sneeze and cough as they are swabbed.</p>
    <p>“So, hav­ing a swab booth pro­tects the doc­tor from com­ing into con­tact with their res­pi­ra­tory droplets,” she said.</p>
    <p>“When pa­tients are swabbed at their neigh­bour­hood GPs, they can re­turn home to await their test re­sults in­stead of hav­ing to travel to other test­ing cen­tres, which brings them more con­ve­nience and also helps to keep the com­mu­nity safe.”</p>
    <p>She added that pa­tients who may be squea­mish about get­ting swabbed would be more com­fort­able if their GPs ad­min­is­ter the test.</p>
    <p>GPs can di­rect pa­tients who re­quire a swab test to se­lected PHPCs in the Swab and Send Home (Sash) pro­gramme, as well as poly­clin­ics.</p>
    <p>For pa­tients to re­ceive a free con­sul­ta­tion and swab test, they must ar­rive at their re­ferred Sash PHPC within 48 hours.</p>
    <p>Oth­er­wise, rates nor­mally charged un­der the Flu Sub­sidy Scheme or Com­mu­nity Health As­sist Scheme will ap­ply.</p>
    <p>The swab tests at PHPCs typ­i­cally take one to two days to process, and pa­tients are ad­vised to stay home while await­ing their re­sults.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors are en­cour­aged to use the booth out­doors, in ar­eas with low hu­man traf­fic, or in a well-ven­ti­lated room in­side the clinic.</p>
    <p>Pan­els on the booth are made of frosted ma­te­rial to en­sure pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>La­tex gloves are af­fixed to a panel sep­a­rat­ing the swab­ber from the pa­tient, for doc­tors to in­sert their hands to col­lect the swab sam­ple from the pa­tient.</p>
    <p>Once the swab has been taken, all ar­eas of the booth must be sprayed im­me­di­ately with a 70 per cent al­co­hol dis­in­fec­tant to pre­vent cross-con­tam­i­na­tion be­tween pa­tients.</p>
