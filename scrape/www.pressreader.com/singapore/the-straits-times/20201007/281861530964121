    <p>GENEVA • A Covid-19 vac­cine may be ready by year end, the head of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus did not give de­tails, but urged sol­i­dar­ity and po­lit­i­cal com­mit­ment by all lead­ers to en­sure equal dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines when they be­come avail­able. “We will need vac­cines and there is hope that by the end of this year we may have a vac­cine. There is hope,” he told the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s ex­ec­u­tive board meet­ing that ex­am­ined the global re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Union’s health reg­u­la­tor yes­ter­day said it has launched a real-time re­view of a vac­cine from US drug­maker Pfizer and Ger­many’s BioNTech, fol­low­ing a sim­i­lar an­nounce­ment for ri­val As­traZeneca’s jab last week. The an­nounce­ment by the Euro­pean Medicines Agency could speed up the process of ap­prov­ing a suc­cess­ful vac­cine in the bloc.</p>
    <p>Nine ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines are in the pipe­line of the WHO-led Co­vax global vac­cine fa­cil­ity that aims to dis­trib­ute two bil­lion doses by</p>
    <p>the end of 2021. So far, some 168 coun­tries have joined the Co­vax fa­cil­ity, but China, the United States and Rus­sia are not among them.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has said it is re­ly­ing on bi­lat­eral deals for sup­plies from vac­cine mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros said: “Es­pe­cially for the vac­cines and other prod­ucts in the pipe­line, the most im­por­tant tool is po­lit­i­cal com­mit­ment from our lead­ers es­pe­cially in the eq­ui­table dis­tri­bu­tion of the vac­cines.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, China is in talks to have its lo­cally pro­duced Covid-19 vac­cines as­sessed by the WHO, as a step to­wards mak­ing them avail­able for in­ter­na­tional use, Dr So­corro Es­ca­late, WHO’s co­or­di­na­tor for es­sen­tial medicines and health tech­nolo­gies in the Western Pa­cific re­gion, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>China has at least four ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines in the fi­nal stage of clin­i­cal tri­als – two from state-backed China Na­tional Biotec Group, and the other two from Si­no­vac Biotech and CanSino Bi­o­log­ics.</p>
