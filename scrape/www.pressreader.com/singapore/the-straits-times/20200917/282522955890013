    <p>TRAIN</p>
    <p>In tele­vi­sion se­ries Psy­chopath Diary (2019 to 2020), South Korean ac­tor Yoon Shi-yoon plays a pushover who be­lieves him­self to be a se­rial killer after los­ing his mem­ory in an ac­ci­dent. It was fun watch­ing him al­ter­nate be­tween be­ing meek and try­ing to be mean, a sce­nario that was milked for laughs.</p>
    <p>In his lat­est se­ries Train, Yoon proves he is equally adept at play­ing the dra­matic role of a tor­tured de­tec­tive. And it is such a turn­around from Psy­chopath Diary – he even looks so dif­fer­ent that it was a few episodes in before I re­alised it was the same ac­tor.</p>
    <p>He plays Seo Do-won, a hard-edged cop who goes all out to nail the bad guys. It could have some­thing to do with his painful past: His fa­ther, as­sumed to be the mur­derer in a rob­bery case, was found dead soon after by the road­side.</p>
    <p>The mur­der vic­tim’s daugh­ter, Han Seo-kyung (Kyung Soo-jin), even­tu­ally grew up along­side Do-won un­der the care of Oh Mi-sook (Lee Hang-na). Twelve years later, Seo-kyung is a pros­e­cu­tor, and Mi-sook a po­lice chief and Do-won’s boss.</p>
    <p>The trio are faced with a puz­zling case: Sev­eral sets of skele­tons are dis­cov­ered at a dis­used train sta­tion and they are linked to the old rob­bery-mur­der.</p>
    <p>The whop­per in the tale is then dropped on us: A train links two par­al­lel worlds and by tak­ing it, Do-won is able to cross over.</p>
    <p>Why a train? Why that par­tic­u­lar train? And why is he able to cross be­tween worlds?</p>
    <p>These are ques­tions that are never an­swered, but no mat­ter, those who de­cide to hop on board</p>
    <p>will find a thrilling ride.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Ryu Se­ung-jin builds ten­sion from the fact that the two worlds are sim­i­lar, but have sub­stan­tial dif­fer­ences. In one, a train sta­tion is dis­used, while in the other, it is a bustling hub; some­one can be dead in one, but alive in the other. There are quite a few twists and sur­prises along the way.</p>
    <p>And yes, there is an­other ver­sion of Do-won as well, and Yoon – with the help of a handy fa­cial scar – makes it clear enough which one is on screen.</p>
    <p>While there are un­re­solved plot holes, I like that the show ad­dresses a bug­bear I have with the par­al­lel world de­vice – to say more might spoil the fun for view­ers – and works it into the story.</p>
    <p>From science-fic­tion to mys­tery to ro­mance, Train packs quite a lot in. But at 12 episodes, it is more of an ex­press jour­ney com­pared with most K-dra­mas.</p>
    <p>HAIKYU!! TO THE TOP</p>
    <p>Haikyu!!, on the other hand, is a long-run­ning manga about high school vol­ley­ball that ended in July after eight years. The good news is that the anime is go­ing strong.</p>
    <p>The first half of the fourth sea­son, Haikyu!! To The Top, was re­leased ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The Kara­suno High School gang is all there: pint-sized, su­per en­thu­si­as­tic Hi­nata; tyran­ni­cal per­fec­tion­ist Kageyama; coolly non­cha­lant Tsuk­ishima; the coach and the rest of the play­ers.</p>
    <p>As with any long-run­ning show, the chal­lenge is to pro­vide fans with the fa­mil­iar­ity of com­fort while in­ject­ing new elements to keep them en­gaged.</p>
    <p>For the ear­lier episodes, the ace pair­ing of Hi­nata and Kageyama – who con­stantly squab­ble, are in­tensely com­pet­i­tive and bring out the best in each other – is sep­a­rated as they head off to dif­fer­ent train­ing camps. There, they have to learn to dig deeper than ever to im­prove their skills.</p>
    <p>The Kara­suno team then heads, fi­nally, to Spring In­ter-High, a na­tional-level com­pe­ti­tion that Hi­nata has been dream­ing about since the first sea­son.</p>
    <p>The an­i­ma­tion is top-notch as ever, con­vey­ing the sense of oc­ca­sion of the event as well as the ex­cit­ing vol­ley­ball ac­tion. One of the things I en­joy about the show is how de­tailed it gets as play­ers leap, serve, re­ceive, spike, strate­gise, rally and pant.</p>
    <p>View­ers will have to wait, though, for the sure-to-be thrilling match be­tween Kara­suno and their sec­ond-round op­po­nents, Inar­izaki High.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond half of sea­son four is slated to be out in Ja­pan on Oct 2.</p>
