    <p>DANCERS’ LOCKER</p>
    <p>Fron­tier Dance­land Zoom screen­ing Sept 12 Chan Sze-Wei</p>
    <p>Seek­ing a dig­i­tal al­ter­na­tive to live dance per­for­mances, Fron­tier Dance­land de­cided that it was out of its depth.</p>
    <p>The com­pany reached out to Jeremy Chua, a film pro­ducer and screen­writer who has been bring­ing to­gether dancers and film­mak­ers since 2015 in the Cinemove­ment plat­form that he helms with Elysa Wendi.</p>
    <p>For the Dancers’ Locker pro­gramme, Chua men­tored six com­pany dancers in con­cep­tu­al­is­ing and de­vel­op­ing their own short films – making clear that they were not so much making dance films as ap­ply­ing dance and chore­og­ra­phy as “a fram­ing of the mind”.</p>
    <p>The re­sults were strik­ing. Each of the six films had a dis­tinc­tive aes­thetic and an en­gag­ing premise.</p>
    <p>No­tably, Tan Xin Yen cre­ated a film in which she danced as her own ghost – with a feral cor­po­re­al­ity and a light bulb for a mouth, she stalked a wet mar­ket at night and jun­gle floor at dawn.</p>
    <p>Nel­son Yeo shot five of the six films pre­sented, and his cinema</p>
    <p>tog­ra­phy for Tan gave a dis­tant and sur­real tex­ture that has burned these im­ages into my mind, notwith­stand­ing the awk­ward ti­tle (You are 56, still count­ing and keep count­ing; I am 25), and the tired de­vice of the ghost be­ing just a dream.</p>
    <p>I was also gripped by Sam­man­tha Yue’s nar­ra­tive of loss Here To­day, Gone To­mor­row, and its im­ages of de­spair in the in­te­rior of a Hous­ing Board flat. A des­o­late bed sheet bil­lowed from a win­dow grille as she rammed her body into walls and floor, and dunked her head vi­o­lently into a tub of water and flow­ers (the kind tra­di­tion­ally used to cleanse a per­son of bad luck).</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme was bal­anced out by the pop-art pal­ette of Ma Yue Ru’s close-ups of ev­ery­day ob­jects, and Mark Robles’ trans­for­ma­tion into sen­su­ous drag.</p>
    <p>Along­side the com­pany’s main stage reper­toire, the Dancers’ Locker stu­dio show­ings give com­pany dancers space to de­velop their own voices.</p>
    <p>Over the years I have caught many whim­si­cal ex­per­i­ments – char­ac­ter­is­ti­cally short-lived pieces made from raw ideas and lo-fi pro­duc­tion val­ues.</p>
    <p>While this pro­gramme was also billed as a work-in-progress, the films showed an im­pres­sive depth of con­cept and so­phis­ti­ca­tion in the use of the mov­ing im­age.</p>
