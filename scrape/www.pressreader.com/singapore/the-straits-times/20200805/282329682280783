    <p>The Pixel 4a – Google’s mid-range smart­phone for this year – was fi­nally launched on Mon­day, af­ter months of de­lay due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Google Pixel launches have been greeted with fan­fare the last few years, de­spite sales of these smart­phones re­main­ing tiny com­pared with other smart­phone brands.</p>
    <p>With the lat­est mid-range Pixel phone, the spot­light is again on its value but per­haps more in­ten­si­fied this year, given the cur­rent down­beat eco­nomic out­look.</p>
    <p>The 5.8-inch Pixel 4a offers a sim­i­lar cam­era and soft­ware ex­pe­ri­ence as Google’s flag­ship Pixel 4 for less than half the price, pit­ting it against Ap­ple’s low-cost iPhone SE.</p>
    <p>On­line pre-or­ders in Sin­ga­pore started on Mon­day at $499 from the Google Store, be­fore ex­pand­ing to Courts On­line and Chal­lenger’s Hachi.tech on­line store yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon Sin­ga­pore will sell the phone from Sept 10.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore con­sumers, the Pixel 4a will be the cheap­est Pixel phone avail­able here and by some mar­gin when com­pared with its Pixel 3a pre­de­ces­sor (from $659). The Pixel 4a will not be of­fered by lo­cal tel­cos.</p>
    <p>In its blog post an­nounc­ing the Pixel 4a, Google also gave a teaser to its next Pixel 5 smart­phone, which will have 5G con­nec­tiv­ity. This flag­ship model will be joined by a 5G ver­sion of the Pixel 4a, start­ing at US$499 (S$690).</p>
    <p>Both of these up­com­ing phones will not be sold in Sin­ga­pore. In­stead, they will be launched later this year in nine mar­kets, with Google promis­ing to re­veal more de­tails in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>A Google spokesman tells The Straits Times the tech firm de­cided not to make its 5G-ca­pa­ble Pixel phones avail­able in Sin­ga­pore based on “a va­ri­ety of fac­tors, in­clud­ing lo­cal mar­ket trends and prod­uct fea­tures”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is tar­get­ing na­tion­wide 5G cov­er­age for half the is­land by end-2022 and the en­tire is­land by 2025.</p>
    <p>De­spite the Pixel 4a’s com­pet­i­tive price tag, an­a­lysts tell The Straits Times it will be dif­fi­cult for the tech gi­ant to re­peat or im­prove on its over­all Pixel sales this year over 2019.</p>
    <p>Last year’s mid-range Pixel 3a likely boosted sales of Pixel phones to an all-time high.</p>
    <p>While Google does not re­veal of­fi­cial sales fig­ures for its smart­phones, it was re­ported in June by mar­ket re­search firm IDC that last year was the best year for the Pixel line, with sales up 52 per cent from 2018 to reach 7.2 mil­lion units.</p>
    <p>This year, Google’s mid-range phone faces a ma­jor com­peti­tor in Ap­ple’s lower-cost iPhone SE (from $649), which had an ad­van­tage of a head­start when it was launched in April.</p>
    <p>How­ever, an­a­lysts say this head­start is far from in­sur­mount­able, given the chal­leng­ing mar­ket con­di­tions brought about by the on­go­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Frank Gil­lett, prin­ci­pal an­a­lyst at mar­ket re­search firm For­rester Re­search, says: “Ev­ery­thing, in­clud­ing the smart­phone re­fresh cy­cle, is off-kil­ter. Many peo­ple have ex­tended or paused their smart­phone up­grade plans.”</p>
    <p>Mr Jeff Field­hack, re­search di­rec­tor at mar­ket re­search firm Coun­ter­point, says con­sumers are al­ways look­ing for great value.</p>
    <p>But he adds that buy­ers typ­i­cally do not switch be­tween Ap­ple’s iOS and Google’s An­droid plat­forms. A Coun­ter­point re­port last month found that over 30 per cent of iPhone SE buy­ers came from an older Ap­ple hand­set while 26 per cent moved from an An­droid de­vice.</p>
    <p>He does not be­lieve Google will re­peat or ex­ceed last year’s Pixel sales be­cause of the fierce com­pe­ti­tion in the smart­phone in­dus­try, which is also fac­ing a dip of 10 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Bryan Ma, vice-pres­i­dent of de­vice re­search at IDC, says the Pixel 4a has plenty of ri­vals, es­pe­cially in Asia, from ag­gres­sively priced Chi­nese brands such as Xiaomi and Oppo.</p>
    <p>“Google’s main sell­ing points will still be the clean An­droid build, Pixel-spe­cific fea­ture up­dates, and imag­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties,” he says.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Ger­rit Sch­nee­mann, se­nior an­a­lyst at mar­ket re­search firm Om­dia, says the pres­ence of ma­jor Chi­nese smart­phone-mak­ers is min­i­mal in the Pixel’s key United States mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Google would be com­pet­ing against LG and Samsung’s mid-range mod­els, which are less price-com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Like the Pixel 3a, the Pixel 4a is avail­able in 13 mar­kets, in­clud­ing the US, Ja­pan and In­dia.</p>
    <p>In a l ocal me­dia brief­ing l ast week, Mr Zach Koch, prod­uct lead of An­droid and Pixel soft­ware, says Google will fo­cus on sell­ing its Pixel phones through on­line chan­nels this year due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Pixel 4a will be in brick-and-mor­tar stores only at Courts and Chal­lenger from midOc­to­ber. On­line pre-or­ders here are open for more than a month, which is un­usu­ally long for a smart­phone launch.</p>
    <p>Google says other launch coun­tries will also have longer than usual pre-or­der pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Koch is up­beat about the Pixel 4a’s prospects. He says there is a stronger mar­ket for mid-range phones like the Pixel 4a be­cause the premium phone mar­ket is soft­en­ing with many con­sumers look­ing for the best bang for the buck.</p>
    <p>Google Pixel 3a user Jen­nifer Lim says her phone is still work­ing fine with­out any is­sues af­ter about a year. “It is bet­ter than my pre­vi­ous phone be­cause it does not hang and is easy to use,” she says.</p>
    <p>But this also means the 38-yearold fi­nance of­fi­cer does not plan to up­grade to the Pixel 4a, de­spite find­ing the price at­trac­tive.</p>
