    <p>CBDC stands for “cen­tral bank dig­i­tal cur­rency”. In a world of CBDCs, all pay­ments would be elec­tronic. There would be no cash. Five years ago, CBDCs were nowhere on the hori­zon. Now, they are one of the hottest top­ics in mone­tary eco­nomics, says as­so­ciate editor Vikram Khanna.</p>
    <p>CBDC. Get used to that acro­nym be­cause you’re go­ing to see a lot more of it. CBDC stands for “cen­tral bank dig­i­tal cur­rency”. How would it work?</p>
    <p>To take a sim­pli­fied ex­am­ple, let’s say the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) is­sues a CBDC. It al­lows in­di­vid­u­als to hold de­posit ac­counts at the MAS, and ev­ery­body does. Then if I need to make a pay­ment to you, I ac­ti­vate the MAS pay­ment app on my phone, fill in the pay­ment de­tails, des­ig­nat­ing you as the payee. The MAS deb­its my ac­count af­ter ver­i­fy­ing I am the right­ful owner and have a suf­fi­cient bal­ance. It then cred­its your ac­count af­ter check­ing your cre­den­tials. Com­mer­cial banks or other in­ter­me­di­aries are not in­volved.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, if I am mak­ing an over­seas pay­ment, it goes dig­i­tally via my ac­count at the MAS to the other coun­try’s cen­tral bank which cred­its the payee. It’s as fast as mak­ing a lo­cal pay­ment. Again, there are no in­ter­me­di­aries and no fees or charges.</p>
    <p>In a world of CBDCs, all pay­ments would be elec­tronic. There would be no cash.</p>
    <p>There’s much more to the story of CBDCs, which can trans­form the way economies are run. But more on that later .</p>
    <p>Five years ago, CBDCs were nowhere on the hori­zon. They were hardly dis­cussed and re­search on them was sparse. But now, they’re one of the hottest top­ics in mone­tary eco­nomics – the sub­ject of a flurry of re­search pa­pers by aca­demics as well as the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund (IMF) and Bank of In­ter­na­tional Set­tle­ments (BIS) – the most im­por­tant fo­rum for cen­tral banks.</p>
    <p>A re­cent BIS sur­vey shows that about 80 per cent of the world’s cen­tral banks are work­ing on CBDCs. China has al­ready launched one.</p>
    <p>And an IMF re­port notes: “CBDCs could be the next mile­stone in the evo­lu­tion of money.” At the IMF-World Bank an­nual meet­ings in Oc­to­ber, CBDCs fig­ured promi­nently in a panel dis­cus­sion on the fu­ture of cross-bor­der pay­ments. The ses­sion was mod­er­ated by IMF man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Kristalina Ge­orgieva, and par­tic­i­pants in­cluded Fed­eral Re­serve chair­man Jerome Pow­ell.</p>
    <p>So why have CBDCs be­come such a hot is­sue?</p>
    <p>THE THREAT FROM STABLECOIN­S</p>
    <p>One of the cat­a­lysts has been the grow­ing pop­u­lar­ity of crypto as­sets such as bit­coin, and es­pe­cially, the at­tempted launch of the “sta­ble­coin” Libra by Face­book last year, which was pitched as a po­ten­tial global cur­rency and tar­geted ini­tially at the two bil­lion-plus users of the so­cial me­dia com­pany.</p>
    <p>It was called sta­ble­coin be­cause its value was sup­posed to be pegged to rel­a­tively sta­ble real-world cur­ren­cies such as the US dol­lar, the euro, Ja­panese yen, pound ster­ling and the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar. Libra met with a frosty re­cep­tion from gov­ern­ments and cen­tral banks, which viewed it as a threat to mone­tary sovereignt­y. They also cited con­cerns about pri­vacy, money laun­der­ing and fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity if such an un­reg­u­lated cur­rency were un­leashed upon the world.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, last week, the Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported that</p>
    <p>Face­book is plan­ning to launch a sim­pli­fied ver­sion of Libra early next year.</p>
    <p>The launch of Libra could em­bolden other big tech com­pa­nies such as Ap­ple, Ama­zon and Google to is­sue their own stablecoin­s, which they could pitch to their huge base of users. Cen­tral banks view this as a po­ten­tial threat. As a June 2020 re­port by the IMF points out: “Sta­ble­coin-based pay­ment sys­tems like Face­book’s Libra could gain a sub­stan­tial share of pay­ments mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>Wide­spread mi­gra­tion into stablecoin­s “could also re­duce com­mer­cial bank de­posits, which could shrink their sources of sta­ble fund­ing… and hin­der credit pro­vi­sion to the econ­omy”. Coun­ter­ing the threat from stablecoin­s is one mo­ti­va­tion for cen­tral banks to launch CBDCs.</p>
    <p>An­other is to re­duce the fric­tion in cross-bor­der pay­ments. The BIS has de­ter­mined that the av­er­age cost of a US$200 bank-based cross-bor­der re­mit­tance is over 10 per cent of the re­mit­tance value. CBDCs could dras­ti­cally cut costs and boost ef­fi­ciency by short­en­ing the pay­ment chain. They could also reach the “un­banked”, which ex­ceed half the pop­u­la­tion in many poor coun­tries.</p>
    <p>MAXED OUT MONE­TARY POL­ICY</p>
    <p>A third pos­si­ble mo­tive is one that cen­tral banks do not men­tion much, but which many pri­vate an­a­lysts have flagged. It arises from the fact that many cen­tral banks have reached the lim­its of mone­tary pol­icy. In­ter­est rates in the US, the euro zone and Ja­pan are ei­ther close to zero or neg­a­tive. Even with rates at such lev­els, credit is not nec­es­sar­ily flow­ing into the econ­omy. It is sup­posed to go via banks, but if the banks don’t lend – whether out of cau­tion or a lack of de­mand – the credit doesn’t flow. That is one prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing all but ex­hausted their tra­di­tional tool­kit, cen­tral banks are count­ing on fis­cal sup­port to boost their economies. But such sup­port is ei­ther not read­ily forth­com­ing – as in the United States and the euro zone – or is not as ef­fec­tive as it should be.</p>
    <p>CBDCs could fill some of th­ese mone­tary and fis­cal gaps. They could en­able cen­tral banks to pro­vide credit di­rectly to in­di­vid­u­als or com­pa­nies, with­out go­ing through com­mer­cial banks, and they can tar­get with pre­ci­sion. For in­stance, they could pay higher in­ter­est rates to low-in­come groups on their de­posits to help them save, while charg­ing mil­lion­aires neg­a­tive in­ter­est rates to in­duce them to spend.</p>
    <p>In a cri­sis, they could ease credit for strug­gling com­pa­nies that can’t get bank loans, while of­fer­ing more strin­gent terms to busi­nesses that don’t need to bor­row. They could favour some sec­tors more than oth­ers, de­pend­ing on which ones need more help.</p>
    <p>In other words, with CBDCs, mone­tary pol­icy would not need to be “one-size-fits-all” and cen­tral banks could also play a fis­cal role at a more gran­u­lar level than gov­ern­ments. The im­pact of such di­rect op­er­a­tions, which by­pass the bank­ing sys­tem as well as tra­di­tional fis­cal poli­cies – which can also be ill-tar­geted – would be far-reach­ing, es­pe­cially dur­ing re­ces­sions. It is per­haps no sur­prise that the eco­nomic crises trig­gered by Covid-19 have height­ened the in­ter­est in CBDCs.</p>
    <p>US DOL­LAR DOM­I­NANCE</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries are also in­ter­ested in creat­ing CBDCs be­cause they could re­duce their de­pen­dence on the US dol­lar.</p>
    <p>The dol­lar’s dom­i­nance in pay­ments and as a re­serve as­set is over­whelm­ing. The BIS found that as of April this year, the US dol­lar was on one side of 88 per cent of cur­rency trades. About two-thirds of global cen­tral bank re­serve as­sets are held in US dol­lars, even though the US ac­counts for only around 25 per cent of global GDP.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries find this trou­bling. They need to stock­pile US dol­lars and can also be vul­ner­a­ble to the “weapon­i­sa­tion” of the dol­lar by US gov­ern­ments – for ex­am­ple, via sanc­tion­ing coun­tries (such as Iran and Venezuela) by pro­hibit­ing them from en­gag­ing in dol­lar trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>China and Rus­sia have also tried to re­duce their de­pen­dence on the US dol­lar, ex­plor­ing bi­lat­eral set­tle­ments with their trad­ing part­ners in other cur­ren­cies. A CBDC might also help.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, if China’s CBDC gains wide­spread ac­cep­tance as a medium of ex­change and a re­serve as­set, that could be one way for China (and coun­tries which trade with it) to re­duce de­pen­dence on the US dol­lar.</p>
    <p>Last year, the Bank of Eng­land’s then gov­er­nor Mark Car­ney also sug­gested that the con­cept of a “syn­thetic hege­monic cur­rency” – such as a pop­u­lar sta­ble­coin – “could dampen the dom­i­neer­ing in­flu­ence of the US dol­lar on global trade”. It would be best, he added, if this came not from pri­vate com­pa­nies, but from the pub­lic sec­tor, through a net­work of CBDCs.</p>
    <p>HURDLES AND RISKS</p>
    <p>But for all their po­ten­tial ben­e­fits, CBDCs could also pose prob­lems.</p>
    <p>One ma­jor is­sue would be their im­pact on com­mer­cial banks. If cen­tral banks at­tracted de­pos­i­tors away from com­mer­cial banks, the lat­ter would lose part of their de­posit base and be forced to raise in­ter­est rates on de­posits, which would lower their mar­gins on loans.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ac­cu­mu­lat­ing de­posits, cen­tral banks may also have to get into the com­mer­cial lend­ing busi­ness, which they are not equipped to do – although they could ac­quire that ex­per­tise. But com­mer­cial banks – as well as other lenders – would not be shut out if cen­tral banks use them to dis­trib­ute CBDCs and con­tinue with their lend­ing func­tions; the im­pact on banks would de­pend on the way CBDCs are de­signed.</p>
    <p>An­other con­cern is that CBDCs could com­pli­cate mone­tary pol­icy by chang­ing peo­ples’ de­mand for money in un­pre­dictable ways. But some econ­o­mists sug­gest that CBDCs could also im­prove the ef­fec­tive­ness of mone­tary pol­icy through bet­ter tar­get­ing and by reach­ing the un­banked, as well as com­pa­nies that can’t ac­cess com­mer­cial banks.</p>
    <p>CBDCs – as well as stablecoin­s – could also lead to “cur­rency sub­sti­tu­tion” as peo­ple switch to us­ing other coun­tries’ CBDCs or pop­u­lar stablecoin­s, which then start dis­plac­ing the do­mes­tic cur­rency.</p>
    <p>This phe­nom­e­non, which is akin to “dol­lar­i­sa­tion” – the switch to us­ing US dol­lars in­stead of the lo­cal cur­rency – might be es­pe­cially pro­nounced in coun­tries with high in­fla­tion, weak fi­nan­cial sys­tems and volatile ex­change rates. How­ever, this prob­lem could be mit­i­gated if the use of any ex­ter­nal cur­rency lo­cally needs the con­sent of the lo­cal cen­tral bank.</p>
    <p>For CBDCs to work in other ju­ris­dic­tions would also need in­ter­op­er­abil­ity be­tween CBDCs and co­or­di­na­tion be­tween cen­tral banks – an­other chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, with cash elim­i­nated, CBDCs will al­low cen­tral banks ac­cess to a trove of in­for­ma­tion on peo­ples’ fi­nan­cial in­flows and ex­pen­di­ture pat­terns, down to sin­gle trans­ac­tions, which would raise is­sues re­lat­ing to pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>The IMF rec­om­mends that be­fore col­lect­ing and us­ing such mi­cro-level con­sumer data, cen­tral banks would need to im­ple­ment ad­e­quate data pro­tec­tion and cy­ber-re­silience mea­sures to avoid data be­ing stolen or mis­used. “With­out th­ese mea­sures in place, cen­tral banks risk high rep­u­ta­tional dam­age, which would out­weigh any po­ten­tial ben­e­fits from CBDCs,” it points out.</p>
    <p>The CBDCs of cen­tral banks with the strong­est pri­vacy rights and data pro­tec­tion would be most pre­ferred by mar­ket par­tic­i­pants. The same goes for stablecoin­s.</p>
    <p>CBDCs would give cen­tral banks awe­some pow­ers to run eco­nomic pol­icy. Gov­ern­ments and so­ci­eties would need to ask them­selves whether they are will­ing to cede such pow­ers to a sin­gle in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial ben­e­fits of CBDCs are huge, but so are the risks and ob­sta­cles. That is why BIS’ gen­eral man­ager Agustin Carstens ad­vises cau­tion. “We need to go slow to avoid mis­takes,” he has said. Or, as Mr Pow­ell of the Fed puts it:</p>
    <p>“It’s more im­por­tant to get it right than to do it fast.”</p>
    <p>But that said, the drum­beat in favour of CBDCs is get­ting louder. They may not be im­mi­nent, but they are com­ing – maybe sooner than many peo­ple think.</p>
    <p>CBDCs could fill some of th­ese mone­tary and fis­cal gaps. They could en­able cen­tral banks to pro­vide credit di­rectly to in­di­vid­u­als or com­pa­nies, with­out go­ing through com­mer­cial banks and they can tar­get with pre­ci­sion. For in­stance, they could pay higher in­ter­est rates to low-in­come groups on their de­posits to help them save, while charg­ing mil­lion­aires neg­a­tive in­ter­est rates to in­duce them to spend.</p>
