    <p>When Yeshiva Univer­sity in the United States got into fi­nan­cial trou­ble a few years ago, some prop­erty de­vel­op­ers saw an op­por­tu­nity.</p>
    <p>To free up cash, the old­est school in the coun­try be­gan sell­ing pieces of its real es­tate, in­clud­ing the Alabama, a stu­dent hous­ing prop­erty in Man­hat­tan that served stu­dents at Yeshiva’s Car­dozo Law School.</p>
    <p>Pebb Cap­i­tal and its part­ner, TriArch Real Es­tate, bought the build­ing for US$58 mil­lion (S$77 mil­lion) in 2016, blow­ing out in­te­rior walls and con­vert­ing it from a dated dor­mi­tory into sleek, fur­nished apart­ments. The in­vestors nearly dou­bled their money, sell­ing the build­ing for US$104 mil­lion in Fe­bru­ary this year; it now houses a mix of grad­u­ate stu­dents and young pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just stu­dents who want this sort of prod­uct,” said Pebb man­ag­ing direc­tor James Jago. De­mand for in­ex­pen­sive hous­ing op­tions is ris­ing among those new to the work­force.</p>
    <p>Pebb was not the only real es­tate firm to re­alise this. Other in­vestors are also seek­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties to ac­quire dorms from strug­gling uni­ver­si­ties and con­vert them into hous­ing for white-col­lar work­ers.</p>
    <p>Thirty per cent of Amer­i­can uni­ver­si­ties, both pub­lic and pri­vate, are run­ning deficits, ac­cord­ing to Moody’s In­vestors Ser­vice, and the Covid-19 pan­demic has only added to fi­nan­cial pres­sures – vir­tual learn­ing has put cam­puses into deep freeze, with on­line classes slash­ing the pop­u­la­tion of stu­dents who would have other­wise pa­tro­n­ised cam­pus book­stores, cof­fee shops and sport­ing events.</p>
    <p>Since the pan­demic hit, Pebb has over­hauled two more stu­dent hous­ing prop­er­ties: The Ca­dence, in</p>
    <p>Tucson, Ari­zona, and Monarch Heights, in the Wash­ing­ton Heights sec­tion of Man­hat­tan, are now up­scale apart­ments aimed at stu­dents and young pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>The shift has been play­ing out for years as uni­ver­si­ties face shrink­ing en­rol­ments and bal­loon­ing debts, but as the pan­demic wors­ens, more col­lege real es­tate will be re­de­vel­oped or sold, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>At­lantic Union Col­lege in Lan­caster, Mas­sachusetts, which closed in 2018, listed its cam­pus for sale in January; Unity Col­lege in Maine is con­sid­er­ing do­ing the same.</p>
    <p>In Ver­mont, Marl­boro Col­lege sold its 202ha cam­pus in May and shut down shortly af­ter. The Ben­jamin Franklin In­sti­tute of Tech</p>
    <p>nol­ogy in Bos­ton an­nounced in Septem­ber that its South End cam­pus would be­come a mixed-use site an­chored by a nurs­ing home.</p>
    <p>The US has the world’s largest stu­dent hous­ing mar­ket, rep­re­sent­ing US$11 bil­lion in real es­tate in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>And as the pan­demic drags on and more uni­ver­si­ties feel the cash crunch, the en­dow­ment gap be­tween legacy cam­puses such as Har­vard and Yale and smaller col­leges is only go­ing to grow.</p>
    <p>The Ca­dence was of­fer­ing a rentby-the-bed­room model be­fore it was ac­quired by Pebb Cap­i­tal in Septem­ber for US$33 mil­lion in a part­ner­ship with Coastal Ridge Real Es­tate.</p>
    <p>Pebb is plan­ning a US$12 mil­lion ren­o­va­tion to con­vert the prop­erty into stu­dios and one- and two-bed­room apart­ments, bring­ing in ameni­ties and de­sign touches to at­tract young pro­fes­sion­als who are mov­ing to Tucson in droves, many from nearby states like Cal­i­for­nia, where real es­tate prices are sig­nif­i­cantly higher.</p>
    <p>The build­ing is a five-minute drive from the Univer­sity of Ari­zona, Tucson, which makes it ideal for stu­dents want­ing to live off cam­pus. Once ren­o­va­tions are com­plete, rents will no longer be of­fered by the bed­room.</p>
    <p>Mr Jago said: “We’re go­ing to be­come the prime down­town mul­ti­fam­ily prop­erty for young pro­fes</p>
    <p>sion­als, and maybe up­per-class or grad­u­ate stu­dents... who want to get away from the un­der­grads throw­ing up out­side the bar.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ja­cob Baum­stein is a sopho­more study­ing in­for­ma­tion sci­ence in a joint pro­gramme at Columbia Univer­sity and the Jewish The­o­log­i­cal Sem­i­nary. De­spite all of his classes be­ing held on­line this year, he moved from his par­ents’ home in Char­lotte, North Carolina, to Pebb’s Monarch Heights build­ing.</p>
    <p>“If I were in a build­ing of all stu­dents, it would be a ghost town,” he said. “Be­cause we have young pro­fes­sion­als here, there’s life and a com­mu­nity feel.”</p>
    <p>Pri­vately owned stu­dent hous</p>
    <p>ing prop­er­ties, which of­ten of­fer bet­ter ameni­ties and more mod­ern decor than on-cam­pus hous­ing op­tions, still re­port steady in­come.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that they col­lected 98 per cent of their rev­enue de­spite the pan­demic, Mr David Adel­man, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Cam­pus Apart­ments, a stu­dent hous­ing provider with prop­er­ties in 15 states, said his prop­er­ties are down only about 5 per­cent­age points in oc­cu­pancy this year, a strong sign that the de­mand for stu­dent hous­ing re­mains.</p>
    <p>Mr Jago of Pebb agreed. “Covid-19 hasn’t re­ally changed any­thing for us,” he said of his busi­ness strat­egy. “It was a cat­a­lyst for ex­ist­ing trends that were al­ready in place.”</p>
