    <p>Ja­mus Lim de­bates Josephine Teo, Jes­sica Tan on jobs data</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party MP Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) crossed swords with Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo over the is­sue of Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) and S Pass hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo noted that in the last five years, their num­ber has grown by fewer than 9,000 a year on av­er­age – less than a third of the 30,400 in the ear­lier five-year pe­riod.</p>
    <p>But As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim said slow­ing the rate of is­suance is a “very blunt strat­egy” to en­sure that lo­cal pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) do not get dis­placed. He then con­tended the slow­down in the rate of EP and S Pass is­suance is less dra­matic than de­picted.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said she was merely stat­ing the facts. Ms Jes­sica Tan (East Coast GRC) asked Prof Lim for sug­ges­tions on the num­bers that Sin­ga­pore should look at, given the is­sues he had ear­lier pointed out with the num­bers “not tal­ly­ing up”.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim said he was not sug­gest­ing the num­bers were in­cor­rect. Ms Tan pressed him to come up with al­ter­na­tive sug­ges­tions in man­ag­ing the is­sue of PMET jobs.</p>
    <p>“Are you sug­gest­ing that we stop the num­ber of EPs com­pletely or S Passes?” she asked. Prof Lim did not re­spond to this but said Sin­ga­pore should not be look­ing at pure num­bers to make con­clu­sions on whether PMETs are be­ing dis­placed.</p>
