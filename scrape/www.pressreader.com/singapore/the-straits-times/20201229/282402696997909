    <p>•</p>
    <p>Six-time cham­pion Roger Fed­erer will miss the Aus­tralian Open for the first time in his ca­reer but he is ex­pected to make his come­back in late Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The record 20-time Grand Slam win­ner has not played since los­ing to even­tual cham­pion and world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic in the semi-fi­nals at Melbourne Park in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Two knee op­er­a­tions put paid to his sea­son and al­though the Aus­tralian Open has been de­layed by three weeks to Feb 8 due to the coun­try’s strict bor­der rules to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus, the hard-court Ma­jor has still come too soon as he con­tin­ues to work his way back to fit­ness.</p>
    <p>Fed­erer, who is train­ing at his off-sea­son base in Dubai, had told the or­gan­is­ers ear­lier this month that the de­layed start could ben­e­fit him, with tour­na­ment or­gan­iser Craig Ti­ley say­ing he had “made a com­mit­ment to travel to Melbourne to play”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, his agent Tony God­sick yes­ter­day said the Swiss was not quite ready to return.</p>
    <p>“Roger has de­cided not to play the 2021 Aus­tralian Open,” he said in a state­ment. “He has made strong progress in the last cou­ple of months with his knee and his fit­ness.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, after con­sul­ta­tion with his team, he de­cided that the best de­ci­sion for him in the long run is to return to com­pet­i­tive ten­nis after the Aus­tralian Open.”</p>
    <p>God­sick added that he was look­ing to build a play­ing cal­en­dar for Fed­erer and “start dis­cus­sions this com­ing week for tour­na­ments that be­gin in late Fe­bru­ary”.</p>
    <p>But it re­mains un­clear what may be the first event in over a year for Fed­erer, as the ATP Tour has only re­leased the cal­en­dar for the first seven weeks of the 2021 sea­son ow­ing to the un­pre­dictabil­ity of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old will hope to be fully fit by then as he will have only five months to pre­pare for the de­layed Tokyo 2020 Games.</p>
    <p>Fed­erer told re­porters ear­lier this month an Olympic sin­gles gold medal – the only prize miss­ing from his tro­phy cabi­net – was the “big one” and his “big plan” was to con­firm his at­ten­dance in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>On the ab­sence of one of the sport’s big­gest draws and a peren­nial crowd favourite, Ti­ley said the or­gan­is­ers un­der­stood the rea­son­ing be­hind his with­drawal and hoped he could return to Melbourne in 2022.</p>
    <p>“In the end Roger ran out of time to get him­self ready for the rigours of a Grand Slam and he’s very dis­ap­pointed he won’t be com­ing to Melbourne in 2021,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We wish him all the best as he pre­pares for his come­back later in the year and look for­ward to see­ing him in Melbourne in 2022.”</p>
    <p>Fed­erer has been an ev­er­p­re­sent at the Aus­tralian Open since his first ap­pear­ance when he lost in qual­i­fy­ing in 1999.</p>
    <p>He has made 15 trips to the semi­fi­nals and won the last of his six Melbourne ti­tles in 2018.</p>
    <p>The year’s first Slam will be played in front of at least 50 per cent of nor­mal crowds, though the at­ten­dance will be largely lo­cal.</p>
    <p>All play­ers must un­dergo a manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine on ar­rival, dur­ing which they will con­stantly be tested for Covid-19 but al­lowed to train for five hours a day in a bio-se­cure bubble.</p>
    <p>In the end Roger ran out of time to get him­self ready for the rigours of a Grand Slam and he’s very dis­ap­pointed he won’t be com­ing to Melbourne in 2021.</p>
    <p>CRAIG TI­LEY, Aus­tralian Open tour­na­ment direc­tor, who hopes Roger Fed­erer, 39, will return in 2022.</p>
