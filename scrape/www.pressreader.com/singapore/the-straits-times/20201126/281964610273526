    <p>We have all seen, and the spate of at­tacks in France and Aus­tria tells us, that the threat of ter­ror­ism hasn’t gone away.</p>
    <p>French teacher Sa­muel Paty’s head was cut off by an 18-year-old Chechen teenager. He had shown his class­room stu­dents, when they were dis­cussing free­dom of speech, car­toons that were put out by Char­lie Hebdo, a satir­i­cal magazine. French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron is­sued a state­ment pay­ing tribute to Mr Paty and de­fend­ing the right in France to pub­lish such car­toons. He made a very strong speech, cov­er­ing many dif­fer­ent as­pects.</p>
    <p>That speech then got a very strong counter-re­ac­tion from Mus­lims around the world, and some de­scribed the ac­tions of France as Is­lam­o­pho­bic. Ji­hadists have jumped on it. They’ve called on fol­low­ers to at­tack French in­ter­ests, and to at­tack any­one who in­sults Is­lam and the way they de­fine as in­sult­ing Is­lam.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, there were fol­low-up at­tacks. There were at­tacks in</p>
    <p>Nice, Lyon and in Vi­enna, Aus­tria. It shows that when ji­hadists make such calls, there are peo­ple who will fol­low, and a few oth­ers, and more ter­ror.</p>
    <p>We all have said, we all know, ji­hadists don’t rep­re­sent Is­lam.</p>
    <p>You have peo­ple like that in ev­ery re­li­gion who will re­sort to vi­o­lence. It is not a prob­lem with any par­tic­u­lar re­li­gion, but you will al­ways have peo­ple like this. The ques­tion is how we deal with them.</p>
    <p>FRENCH CON­CEPT OF LAICITE</p>
    <p>What has hap­pened in France has restarted the de­bate on what free­dom of ex­pres­sion means, how much you can say, and what is the bound­ary be­tween free ex­pres­sion and your obli­ga­tion not to of­fend some­one’s re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>In France, sec­u­lar­ism, the French call it laicite, means that the gov­ern­ment will not in­ter­vene in re­li­gious mat­ters or stop pub­li­ca­tions that at­tack re­li­gions.</p>
    <p>Free­dom of speech is quite ab­so­lute to the ex­tent that it even in­cludes the right to blas­pheme, which means you can pub­lish any­thing that is of­fen­sive to any re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>This didn’t hap­pen overnight. If you go back some cen­turies... to the Middle Ages, the Church was ex­tremely pow­er­ful. If a cler­gy­man was walk­ing on the streets and if you didn’t kneel and pay homage, you could be whipped, you could be ar­rested. But over the cen­turies, with the Re­nais­sance, with the as­ser­tion of na­tion­hood... the bal­ance shifted.</p>
    <p>Along the way, but not be­fore there were sev­eral re­li­gious wars be­tween the Protes­tants and Catholics, and be­tween the kings and the churches, and of course the French Rev­o­lu­tion... the prin­ci­ples of sep­a­ra­tion of state and re­li­gion, and the sec­u­lar­ity of the state, de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>Post-World War, that be­came a stronger prin­ci­ple. At the same time, France, along with some other coun­tries, faced greater immigratio­n post-World War II.</p>
    <p>There are two prin­ci­ples worth not­ing about the French ex­pe­ri­ence. One, the French state, the es­tab­lish­ment, as­sumed that new im­mi­grants will ac­cept the French way of look­ing at free­dom of speech and that they will also ac­cept the French ap­proach to sec­u­lar­ity, mean­ing you could say what you like about any re­li­gion and the state will not in­ter­vene. They ex­pected that all the new im­mi­grants will ac­cept that.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment and the state did not en­gage in any ac­tive ef­forts to in­te­grate the new im­mi­grants, to see how their val­ues can be in­te­grated with the French ap­proach, nor did they look at whether the French ap­proach needed to be re­con­sid­ered and re­cal­i­brated in the light of the chang­ing pop­u­la­tion. The French sim­ply as­sumed that ev­ery­one will ac­cept their tra­di­tional val­ues.</p>
    <p>And laicite meant that the state couldn’t ac­tu­ally in­ter­vene, or se­ri­ously in­ter­act with dif­fer­ent re­li­gions. They left the re­li­gions to them­selves and they couldn’t help bring peo­ple to­gether, mould a com­mon view­point, while pro­tect­ing free­dom of re­li­gion. Some­thing like MHA (Min­istry of Home Af­fairs) in­ter­act­ing with RRG (Re­li­gious Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Group) to pro­mote... unity, to pro­mote a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of re­li­gion, would not be ac­cept­able in France, be­cause that means the state is get­ting in­volved. But it’s very dif­fi­cult with­out the state get­ting in­volved. The state doesn’t tell peo­ple what to be­lieve in – that must be for re­li­gious lead­ers – but the state has re­sources that can be brought in to help, to as­sist.</p>
    <p>What is the re­sult when the state takes a hands-off ap­proach and if we took a hands-off ap­proach? You have pub­li­ca­tions like Char­lie Hebdo, which pub­lish re­pul­sive, highly of­fen­sive car­toons and ar­ti­cles on re­li­gion, in the name of free speech. And the French ex­pect all re­li­gions to ac­cept this.</p>
    <p>The French are shaped by their own tra­di­tion, their own his­tory. For them, this is new, they don’t re­alise it.</p>
    <p>But look­ing at it as an out­sider, some will say that if you in­sult my re­li­gion, I am not go­ing to stand by and say this is your right to free speech. I’m not go­ing to ac­cept that free speech means that you can give of­fence to my re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>So France will have to find a way to bridge this gulf be­tween its prin­ci­ples of laicite and free­dom, and the ex­pec­ta­tions and be­liefs of its peo­ple who don’t ac­cept that their re­li­gion should be of­fen­sively car­i­ca­tured.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE’S AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>Ev­ery now and then, we get de­bates in Sin­ga­pore – why is the Gov­ern­ment not al­low­ing free speech, why is the Gov­ern­ment so pro­tec­tive or so de­fen­sive when it comes to race and re­li­gion? This is why we are de­fen­sive when it comes to race and re­li­gion. Be­cause if we take a hands-off ap­proach, then peo­ple will say since the Gov­ern­ment won’t do some­thing, I will do some­thing, and peo­ple are go­ing to be up­set with one an­other.</p>
    <p>Na­tional har­mony will be af­fected and the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple will be af­fected. Some groups will be say­ing yes, free speech, it’s okay, I don’t get of­fended, you can say what you like about the Prophet, the Pope or God. But many other peo­ple would feel of­fended. So that is why we take a dif­fer­ent ap­proach.</p>
    <p>We take a sec­u­lar ap­proach, so when the Gov­ern­ment looks at poli­cies, we are sec­u­lar. We don’t favour any par­tic­u­lar re­li­gion and we guar­an­tee free­dom of re­li­gion. We are sec­u­lar, France is sec­u­lar; we guar­an­tee free­dom of re­li­gion, France guar­an­tees free­dom of re­li­gion. But how we achieve it is dif­fer­ent. France says that it prefers to achieve it by tak­ing a hands-off ap­proach; we are in­ter­ven­tion­ist, we in­ter­vene.</p>
    <p>Be­cause we take the po­si­tion, that the right to speak freely goes with the duty to act re­spon­si­bly, the two must go to­gether.</p>
    <p>And, as a sec­u­lar gov­ern­ment, we are neu­tral in the treat­ment of all re­li­gions. We also do not al­low any re­li­gion to be at­tacked or in­sulted by any­body else, whether ma­jor­ity or mi­nor­ity. Same rules.</p>
    <p>We guar­an­tee free­dom of re­li­gion, the right of ev­ery per­son to prac­tise his or her re­li­gious be­liefs, and we pro­tect ev­ery­one, ma­jor­ity or mi­nor­ity, from any threats, hate speech or vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>That is the as­sur­ance one gets in Sin­ga­pore. It is also what we need to do to make sure that we pre­serve racial and re­li­gious har­mony in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There­fore, the Char­lie Hebdo types of car­toons will not be al­lowed in Sin­ga­pore, whether they are about Catholi­cism or Protes­tants or Is­lam or Hin­dus. Free speech for us stops at the bound­ary of giv­ing of­fence to re­li­gion. There is a fence, and that fence pro­tects re­li­gious sen­si­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Char­lie Hebdo car­toon­ists, if they were here, they would have been told to stop. If they didn’t stop, ISD (In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Depart­ment) would visit them, and they would have been ar­rested.</p>
    <p>We be­lieve that we can build a multi-re­li­gious, mul­tira­cial so­ci­ety based on trust, and only by tak­ing a firm stance against hate speech, and deal­ing with all com­mu­ni­ties equally and fairly.</p>
    <p>We have laws de­signed to en­sure racial and re­li­gious har­mony in Sin­ga­pore. We up­date them reg­u­larly to make sure that they are rel­e­vant and ef­fec­tive as times change.</p>
    <p>Many of you might know that we amended the Main­te­nance of Re­li­gious Har­mony Act (MRHA) last year. One key amend­ment is that the min­is­ter can is­sue re­strain­ing or­ders to take ef­fect im­me­di­ately, re­mov­ing the re­quire­ment for a 14-day no­tice pe­riod, be­cause when it was in­tro­duced sev­eral decades ago, you had to give 14 days’ no­tice. But to­day, if you give 14 days’ no­tice, it goes around the world sev­eral times be­fore 14 min­utes are up. With so­cial me­dia and the</p>
    <p>In­ter­net, a 14-day no­tice pe­riod doesn’t work any more.</p>
    <p>We’ve been notic­ing for­eign groups in­ter­ven­ing, us­ing re­li­gion, not just in Sin­ga­pore, but in many other coun­tries. We didn’t want to wait un­til that hap­pened here, so we made amend­ments to the MRHA to say that for­eign ac­tors should not be ex­ploit­ing our re­li­gious groups, im­pos­ing their val­ues here.</p>
    <p>Let Sin­ga­pore Mus­lims, Sin­ga­pore Chris­tians, Sin­ga­pore Hin­dus de­cide for them­selves.</p>
    <p>You can adapt the re­li­gious be­liefs, but for­eign­ers shouldn’t in­ter­vene ac­tively in the way we do it.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious groups are now re­quired to re­port all dona­tions they re­ceive from over­seas, and we have rules. It doesn’t pre­vent for­eign lead­er­ship of our or­gan­i­sa­tions, but we have rules re­strict­ing the num­ber of for­eign­ers who can be in com­mit­tees in charge of re­li­gious in­sti­tu­tions. The Gov­ern­ment can also is­sue a re­strain­ing or­der against re­li­gious groups to pro­hibit dona­tions, or change the lead­er­ship, if we as­sess that for­eign­ers are heav­ily in­flu­enc­ing those groups.</p>
    <p>In con­trast to France, we main­tain sec­u­lar­ity, we guar­an­tee free­dom of re­li­gion by putting a limit to free speech. We’ll say it can­not be used to at­tack re­li­gion, and ac­tively in­ter­vene to put in poli­cies which pro­mote re­li­gious har­mony.</p>
    <p>I’m shar­ing this be­cause France has been in the news, the French ap­proach has been in the news, and in Sin­ga­pore, the con­stant de­bate is about free­dom of speech and the lim­its. So, we un­der­stand why 40 to 50 years ago, our first gen­er­a­tion of lead­ers de­cided on these prin­ci­ples which are still valid.</p>
