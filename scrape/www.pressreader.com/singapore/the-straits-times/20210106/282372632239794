    <p>Record-break­ing sumo cham­pion Hakuho has tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 just days be­fore the New Year tour­na­ment, the Ja­pan Sumo As­so­ci­a­tion (JSA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The JSA said Hakuho was tested af­ter notic­ing a loss of smell, and that other mem­bers of the Miyagino sta­ble who are thought to have come into con­tact with him would also be tested.</p>
    <p>The Mon­go­lian-born 35-yearold, who has won a record 44 tour­na­ments and holds sumo’s high­est rank of yokozuna, had been pre­par­ing for the 15-day New Year</p>
    <p>Grand Sumo Tour­na­ment, which starts on Sun­day in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>A JSA spokesman said his par­tic­i­pa­tion was as yet un­de­cided, but the com­pe­ti­tion would go ahead as sched­uled.</p>
    <p>Hakuho’s in­fec­tion comes af­ter 11 mem­bers of the Arashio sta­ble tested pos­i­tive last week fol­low­ing the in­fec­tion of top-di­vi­sion wrestler Wakatakak­age.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal media re­ported that the new cases in­cluded sta­ble mas­ter Arashio, a hair­dresser and eight lower-di­vi­sion wrestlers.</p>
    <p>A gy­oji, or ref­eree, from a dif­fer­ent sta­ble also tested pos­i­tive on</p>
    <p>Mon­day af­ter com­plain­ing of a fever and cough.</p>
    <p>While a 20-year-old Ja­panese sumo wrestler died in May af­ter con­tract­ing the virus, Hakuho is the first wrestler from the sport’s top ranks to test pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
    <p>He has been deal­ing with a knee injury and has not com­peted in a tour­na­ment since March, when he won the Spring Grand Sumo Tour­na­ment in Osaka.</p>
    <p>He with­drew from three straight tour­na­ments last year, and was given an of­fi­cial warn­ing by the JSA along with fel­low yokozuna Kakuryu in Novem­ber for re­peated ab­sences.</p>
    <p>The warn­ing is the sport’s strong­est re­buke, short of rec­om­mend­ing re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>Hakuho, whose real name is Munkhbat Davaa­jar­gal, came to Ja­pan aged 15 to take up sumo and ac­quired cit­i­zen­ship in Septem­ber 2019.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan is cur­rently bat­tling a third wave of in­fec­tions, with media re­ports in­di­cat­ing a state of emer­gency in the greater Tokyo area is set to be an­nounced this week.</p>
