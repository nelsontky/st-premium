    <p>It’s Mon­day, four days be­fore Boleh Boleh – Sin­ga­pore’s big­gest pork-free food­court – opens for busi­ness on Christ­mas Day on the fourth floor of Cle­menti Mall.</p>
    <p>The sig­nages for the 28 food stalls, among them Pe­tal­ing Street Fa­mous Clay­pot Chicken Rice, Da­mansara Chilly Pan Mee and Pe­nang Road’s Fa­mous Chen­dol, are up but work­ers are beaver­ing away to make sure noth­ing goes awry on open­ing day.</p>
    <p>Tan Kim Siong, 50, and his two broth­ers Kim Beng, 48, and Kim Leng, 43, are chat­ting with busi­ness part­ner New Mun Kit, 41, and var­i­ous work­ers, go­ing over the finer de­tails of get­ting the 10,000 sq ft food­court ready.</p>
    <p>Boleh Boleh is the Tan broth­ers’ lat­est baby, a new ad­di­tion to the food em­pire they built, one com­pris­ing 15 brands (in­clud­ing Fei Siong, Malaysia Boleh, Nam Kee Pau and En­cik Tan) and nearly 160 out­lets in hawker cen­tres, cof­fee shops and food­courts all over the is­land.</p>
    <p>The Fei Siong Group, which has three busi­ness en­ti­ties, em­ploys 1,600 staff and in 2019 made nearly $150 mil­lion in rev­enue.</p>
    <p>Re­mark­ably, it all started with a hum­ble fish­ball noodle stall started by Kim Siong.</p>
    <p>The slim 50-year-old – decked out like a Hong Kong celebrity in an all white track suit and a six-fig­ure Richard Mille watch on his wrist – dropped out of school at 15 to be­come a hawker.</p>
    <p>“I’m the el­dest and my three younger sib­lings were still in school. Money was tight,” says Kim Siong, whose fa­ther was a Port of Sin­ga­pore Au­thor­ity con­tainer driver and mother, a fac­tory worker.</p>
    <p>“But I also liked busi­ness and wanted to learn more about hawker food,” he says in a mix­ture of English, Man­darin and Hokkien.</p>
    <p>He was no stranger to the trade. His ma­ter­nal grand­fa­ther ran a Teochew fish­ball noodle stall in Red­hill Mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“I had helped out at the stall since I was 13. I’d fil­let fish and make fish­balls in the morning be­fore go­ing to school. Af­ter school, I’d go back to the stall to help.”</p>
    <p>To earn ex­tra money, the for­mer stu­dent of Queen­stown Sec­ondary Tech­ni­cal spent evenings work­ing as an as­sis­tant for neigh­bour­ing stalls. “I helped to sell fish soup, curry rice, econ­omy rice and zi char,” he says, us­ing the Hokkien phrase which means cook and fry. “That’s why I know the recipes for many dishes.”</p>
    <p>With his ex­pe­ri­ence, scor­ing a cook­ing gig at a noodle stall in Bukit Ba­tok was not dif­fi­cult when he started work­ing in the mid 1980s. “I was paid about $1,500 a month, which was not bad,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>Hard work was not anath­ema, not when he saw the po­ten­tial in the trade. “There were so many new towns and es­tates com­ing up then. Busi­ness was good. The stall I was work­ing for could sell a few hun­dred bowls of noo­dles a day,” he says.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a year, one of his un­cles – also a hawker – helped him start a fish­ball noodle stall in Boon Lay.</p>
    <p>“It was hard work but it was re­ally good train­ing and taught me a lot about run­ning my own stall,” says Kim Siong, who had the stall for two years be­fore sell­ing it when na­tional ser­vice beck­oned.</p>
    <p>Af­ter com­plet­ing his na­tional ser­vice in 1990, he started another noodle stall in Telok Blan­gah, with the help of another hawker un­cle. Over the next few years, he moved a cou­ple of times, sharp­en­ing his street smarts and en­tre­pre­neur­ial in­stincts with each move.</p>
    <p>He is grate­ful to a cof­fee shop owner in Kal­lang Bahru who in­creased his rent from $500 to $1,150 in three years. “Look­ing back, if not for him, I would not have ven­tured out and things could have been very dif­fer­ent,” he says.</p>
    <p>In­deed, his move to the fa­mous food cen­tre – run by S11 Cof­feeshop – in front of the old Na­tional Li­brary in 1995 was a game changer.</p>
    <p>“It worked out very well for me. I could charge slightly higher prices be­cause of the area. There were also good crowds not just for lunch but also for din­ner and sup­per,” says Kim Siong, who got his mother and Kim Beng on board.</p>
    <p>Kim Beng says: “I also didn’t like to study and dropped out in Pri­mary 5. I worked for my un­cles be­fore my brother asked me to join him.”</p>
    <p>Busi­ness was brisk. One year later, Kim Siong opened another stall in Wood­lands.</p>
    <p>He no­ticed another trend: Old cof­fee shops were get­ting makeovers and giv­ing hawker cen­tres a run for their money. “There were many op­por­tu­ni­ties,” he says.</p>
    <p>And he grabbed them. Over the next five years, he opened about 10 out­lets.</p>
    <p>It was not all hunky dory.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t know how to train, guide and man­age so some­times the qual­ity was not there. We also did not have SOPs,” he says can­didly, re­fer­ring to stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>That’s when se­cond brother Kim Leng de­cided to quit his elec­tri­cal engi­neer­ing course at Ngee Ann Polytech­nic to join the busi­ness. A year later in 2001, his polytech­nic class­mate Mun Kit came on board as a part­ner.</p>
    <p>Kim Leng’s job was to set up a proper man­age­ment and train­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“And col­lect money,” Kim Siong says be­fore let­ting out a loud cackle.</p>
    <p>Another turn­ing point came in 2006 when Kim Siong set up EAT, a stand­alone shop con­cept sell­ing fish­ball noo­dles, minced meat noo­dles and laksa at The Rail Mall in Up­per Bukit Timah.</p>
    <p>“In the process, I learnt a lot about ren­o­va­tions, in­te­rior de­sign,” says Kim Siong, adding that there are now 22 EAT out­lets all over Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>His big­gest break­through came in 2012 when he launched the 7,000 sq ft Malaysia Boleh! in Jurong Point. The food­court brought to­gether nearly 20 stalls sell­ing some of Malaysia’s best hawker fare, in­clud­ing prawn noo­dles from Jalan Cheong Fatt Tze in Pe­nang, Clay­pot rice from Pe­tal­ing Street in Kuala Lumpur and Bak Kut Teh from Klang. It proved so suc­cess­ful that an 8,000 sq ft ex­ten­sion and another 15 stalls were added five years later.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans love to drive to Malaysia to eat, to Klang for bak kut teh, and Ipoh for their beansprout­s and chicken. I thought: Why not I bring every­thing to one place?,” says Kim Siong.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, he had planned to get the hawk­ers to op­er­ate the stalls them­selves in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He went to Pe­nang and ap­proached sev­eral fa­mous hawk­ers but was waved away.</p>
    <p>“One hawker un­cle told me: ‘Don’t waste time lah, my rent here (in Malaysia) is so cheap, my next gen­er­a­tion does not want to take over and you want me to pay you to go to Sin­ga­pore and ex­pand the busi­ness?’”</p>
    <p>He of­fered to buy their recipes in­stead. Charmed by Kim Siong’s af­fa­bil­ity, the same hawker helped to ar­range din­ner with sev­eral of his peers. A deal was struck.</p>
    <p>“Some­times it’s all about re­la­tion­ships. Many of the hawk­ers trusted me. They just wanted the as­sur­ance that their recipe would be in good hands and that their brand would not be spoilt.</p>
    <p>“Re­cently a bak chang seller from Pe­nang gave me his recipe. When I wanted to give him an ang pow, he scolded me and said that if I did, he would take the recipe back. Here in Sin­ga­pore, some hawk­ers are ask­ing for mil­lions for their recipes,” he says, shak­ing his head.</p>
    <p>The most he has shelled out for a recipe is RM50,000 (S$16,000), he says.</p>
    <p>There was no look­ing back af­ter that. The broth­ers in­tro­duced a whole slew of food con­cepts in­clud­ing Nam Kee Pau, Malaysia Chiak (a smaller ver­sion of Malaysia Boleh) and En­cik Tan, which of­fers ha­lal Chi­nese dishes.</p>
    <p>Kim Siong says: “A lot of Mus­lims go to Jurong Point and see</p>
    <p>Malaysia Boleh! and they ask me: ‘Eh, why you don’t do ha­lal ver­sion?’”</p>
    <p>En­cik Tan proved to be a roar­ing suc­cess, with 19 out­lets to­day in Sin­ga­pore. This has spurred Kim Siong and his broth­ers to up the ante and open Boleh Boleh! They hope to get their ha­lal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion soon.</p>
    <p>The roles of the Tan broth­ers are clearly de­fined. Kim Siong, a di­vorcee, takes care of lo­ca­tion and land­lord re­la­tions. Kim Beng, who has two chil­dren, takes care of cof­fee shop food­stalls, while Kim Leng, a fa­ther of five, han­dles project de­vel­op­ment and man­age­ment. Busi­ness part­ner</p>
    <p>Mun Kit over­sees oper­a­tions man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The brain, says Kim Leng, is his el­dest brother. “He is very smart and also has a very big heart.”</p>
    <p>Not all their busi­ness ven­tures were money spin­ners. There were fail­ures along the way, like Chi­nese restau­rant Royal Lon­don Duck and Span­ish eatery La Cala.</p>
    <p>Kim Siong says: “They were good lessons. It has taught me to fo­cus. From now on, I will stick to what I know best, hawker fare in hawker cen­tres, food­courts and cof­fee shops.”</p>
    <p>He is chuffed that hawker cul­ture in Sin­ga­pore has been of­fi­cially added to the Unesco Rep­re­sen­ta­tive List of the In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity. “It’s re­ally good news, it’s putting our food cul­ture on the world map. And it will of course help us when we want to ex­pand over­seas,” says the hawker hon­cho, adding that Fei Siong Group has plans to ex­pand to Lon­don and South Korea.</p>
    <p>The Tan broth­ers give back by reg­u­larly spon­sor­ing com­mu­nity ini­tia­tives in­clud­ing those run by The Rice Com­pany, which man­ages The Busi­ness Times’ char­ity The Busi­ness Times Bud­ding Artists Fund.</p>
    <p>Last month, they do­nated $5,000 worth of food vouch­ers to about 140 fam­i­lies from PPIS (Sin­ga­pore Mus­lim Women’s As­so­ci­a­tion) Stu­dent Care Cen­tre. In 2019, they hosted 62 fam­i­lies from PPIS Fam­ily Ser­vice Cen­tres to a Chi­nese-style meal at their En­cik Tan out­let in Ma­rina Square.</p>
    <p>Asked to ex­plain their suc­cess, Kim Siong replies: “You must be hun­gry and not afraid of hard work. You must also treat peo­ple well. My staff is my fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“And of course, you also must have luck.”</p>
