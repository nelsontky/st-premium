    <p>BEI­JING, MOSCOW • China, which has held off on con­grat­u­lat­ing US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion win­ner Joe Bi­den even as lead­ers of other coun­tries have done so, said yes­ter­day it would fol­low cus­tom in re­spond­ing to the re­sult.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, a Demo­crat, clinched enough states to win the pres­i­dency but in­cum­bent Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has not con­ceded and is mak­ing le­gal chal­lenges to the out­come of the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“We no­ticed that Mr Bi­den has de­clared elec­tion vic­tory,” Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin told a daily me­dia brief­ing. “We un­der­stand that the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion re­sult will be determined fol­low­ing US law and pro­ce­dures.”</p>
    <p>In 2016, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping sent con­grat­u­la­tions to Mr Trump on Nov 9, a day af­ter the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween China and the United States are at their worst in decades over dis­putes rang­ing from tech­nol­ogy and trade to Hong Kong and the coro­n­avirus, and the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has un­leashed a bar­rage of sanc­tions against Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>While Mr Bi­den is ex­pected to main­tain a tough stance on China – he has called Mr Xi a “thug” and vowed to lead a cam­paign to “pres­sure, iso­late and pun­ish China” – he is likely to take a more mea­sured and mul­ti­lat­eral ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Krem­lin in Rus­sia also said yes­ter­day it would wait for the of­fi­cial re­sults of the elec­tion be­fore com­ment­ing on its out­come, and that it noted in­cum­bent Mr Trump’s le­gal chal­lenges re­lated to the vote. Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin has re­mained silent on the is­sue since Mr Bi­den clinched the pres­i­dency last Satur­day, four days af­ter the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters on a con­fer­ence call, Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow deemed that it was bet­ter to wait for the of­fi­cial re­sults be­fore com­ment­ing. He added that Mr Putin had re­peat­edly said he was ready to work with any US leader and that Rus­sia hoped it could es­tab­lish dia­logue with the new US ad­min­is­tra­tion and find a way to nor­malise re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Moscow’s ties with Wash­ing­ton sank to postCold War lows in 2014 when Rus­sia an­nexed Crimea from Ukraine. Mr Bi­den was serv­ing as vice-pres­i­dent un­der Pres­i­dent Barack Obama at the time.</p>
