    <p>We thank Dr Shan­non Ang for his views (More clar­ity needed on is­sue of ra­cial bal­ance, Oct 19).</p>
    <p>In­for­ma­tion on Sin­ga­pore’s cit­i­zen ra­cial com­po­si­tion is pub­lished an­nu­ally and is pub­licly avail­able.</p>
    <p>Given the sen­si­tiv­ity of race is­sues, the Gov­ern­ment’s ap­proach has been to care­fully man­age the ra­cial bal­ance among our cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Any large shift could re­sult in an eth­nic com­mu­nity feel­ing marginalis­ed, or that their iden­tity and be­long­ing in so­ci­ety are be­ing eroded. This could give rise to neg­a­tive sen­ti­ments against the other com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Broadly, two fac­tors af­fect the ra­cial bal­ance of our cit­i­zen pop­u­la­tion: births and im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment pro­vides strong sup­port for Sin­ga­pore­ans to marry and have chil­dren – this is our pri­mary strat­egy for build­ing and main­tain­ing a strong Sin­ga­porean core.</p>
    <p>Our im­mi­gra­tion poli­cies aug­ment our cit­i­zen pop­u­la­tion. The Gov­ern­ment has said on sev­eral oc­ca­sions that our in­take of im­mi­grants is care­fully cal­i­brated so that our ra­cial bal­ance is main­tained. As such, ra­cial pro­por­tions in our cit­i­zen pop­u­la­tion have re­mained sta­ble. In the last 10 years, the pro­por­tion of cit­i­zens of Chi­nese eth­nic­ity has re­mained at 76 per cent, Malay at 15 per cent, In­dian at 7.5 per cent, and the Oth­ers at 1.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion is be­com­ing more di­verse, with more in­ter-eth­nic and transna­tional mar­riages.</p>
    <p>Recognisin­g this, the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity (ICA) now ac­cepts ap­pli­cants’ race dec­la­ra­tions for their National Reg­is­tra­tion Iden­tity Cards, which is not lim­ited to the Chi­nese, Malay, In­dian and Oth­ers cat­e­gories. ICA also al­lows for dou­ble-bar­relled race clas­si­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Aside from pre­serv­ing the ra­cial bal­ance, the Gov­ern­ment also works with com­mu­ni­ties to build stronger re­la­tion­ships among the dif­fer­ent races. We ac­tively fos­ter shared spa­ces and ex­pe­ri­ences in our schools, neigh­bour­hoods, work­places and in national ser­vice. This en­ables peo­ple from all eth­nic groups to in­ter­act, build friend­ships and en­gage in con­struc­tive dis­course. We en­sure that ev­ery­one is treated fairly and equally, re­gard­less of race or re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>As a na­tion, the ideal must be to see and man­age our­selves as one united peo­ple. How­ever, the lived re­al­ity is that race is deeply in­grained in how hu­mans re­late to each other, and it will be some time yet be­fore this divi­sion dis­ap­pears from our con­scious­ness.</p>
    <p>Un­til then, we will con­tinue to cel­e­brate our di­ver­sity, and strive to main­tain and im­prove upon the ra­cial har­mony that we have worked so hard to se­cure.</p>
