    <p>In­spired by the gen­eros­ity of their late par­ents, three sis­ters have come to­gether to pro­vide free vege­tar­ian meals to the needy.</p>
    <p>Krsna’s Free Meals, which was started in 2018, of­fers free break­fast and lunch daily to mi­grant work­ers, the el­derly and any­one else in need.</p>
    <p>Ms Chandralat­ika Devi Dasi, 57, Ms Gand­hini Devi Dasi, 54, and Ms Latha Govindasam­y, 51, who are sis­ters, are be­hind the soup kitchen.</p>
    <p>They are joined by Mr Raghu­pati Das, 57, who is Ms Chandralat­ika’s hus­band; and Mr Lee Chee Seng, 54, who is mar­ried to Ms Gand­hini.</p>
    <p>Krsna’s Free Meals is lo­cated at 16 Veerasamy Road in Lit­tle In­dia. Break­fast is avail­able for take­away from 6.30am to 9.30am, and lunch is served from 11am to 2.30pm.</p>
    <p>Ms Govindasam­y, a for­mer teacher, said: “My par­ents in­stilled in us the value of shar­ing, and they told us you don’t have to be rich to share.”</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther was a driver, her mother a house­wife, and they had eight chil­dren. Her fa­ther was a man of modest means, yet he would in­vite poor peo­ple, in­clud­ing those he met at the tem­ple, to eat with them at his home.</p>
    <p>Ms Chandralat­ika, a house­wife with two chil­dren, said her fam­ily was also in­spired by the teach­ings of</p>
    <p>spir­i­tual teacher A.C. Bhak­tivedanta Swami Prab­hu­pada, the founder of the Hare Kr­ishna move­ment, who ex­horted his fol­low­ers to feed the poor so no one goes hun­gry.</p>
    <p>Ms Chandralat­ika, who is one of the cooks at Krsna’s, said: “My pas­sion is cook­ing. And my chil­dren are grown-ups, so it’s eas­ier for me to do this.”</p>
    <p>Apart from Mr Lee, who is a lo­gis­tics su­per­vi­sor, the other four are vol­un­teer­ing full-time at Krsna’s Free Meals.</p>
    <p>It has been reg­is­tered as a so­ci­ety, and the group is in the midst of ap­ply­ing to be­come a char­ity. It now pro­vides up to 800 break­fast packs and 700 lunch boxes a day.</p>
    <p>The five are aided by a pool of more than 300 vol­un­teers who work in shifts, with safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place, to cut the veg­eta­bles and pack the meals.</p>
    <p>The sis­ters, Mr Raghu­pati and Mr Lee ini­tially forked out a five­fig­ure sum from their own pock­ets to kick-start the soup kitchen, said Ms Govindasam­y. But over time, donors have stepped for­ward with food and cash.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans are a very gen­er­ous lot,” said Ms Govindasam­y.</p>
    <p>The donors in­clude veg­etable whole­salers and mi­grant work­ers, some of whom will give a 5kg or 10kg pack of rice on pay­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Govindasam­y said that one rea­son why the group de­cided to of­fer free vege­tar­ian meals was that none of the other soup kitchens in Sin­ga­pore pro­vided such fare.</p>
    <p>Many mi­grant work­ers are veg­e­tar­i­ans, she noted.</p>
    <p>Those who re­ceive the free meals in­clude card­board col­lec­tors and el­derly in­di­vid­u­als who are poor.</p>
    <p>Some un­em­ployed peo­ple, vic­tims of the eco­nomic fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic, are also com­ing for­ward for the free meals.</p>
    <p>“Any­one can come and take the food – no ques­tions asked,” said Ms Govindasam­y.</p>
    <p>Re­tired butcher Gu­lam Hus­san, 81, who is un­mar­ried and lives in a rental flat, has been among those re­ceiv­ing free meals for the past year.</p>
    <p>He said: “The free meals are very good for poor peo­ple like us. And the food is good.”</p>
    <p>My par­ents in­stilled in us the value of shar­ing, and they told us you don’t have to be rich to share.</p>

    <p>My pas­sion is cook­ing. And my chil­dren are grown-ups, so it’s eas­ier for me to do this (cook­ing at Krsna’s Free Meals).</p>
