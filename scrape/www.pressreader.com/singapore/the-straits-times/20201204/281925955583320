    <p>TRIER • A 51-year-old Ger­man man sus­pected of mur­der­ing five peo­ple, in­clud­ing a baby, by plough­ing a speed­ing car into a pedes­trian zone in Ger­many’s Trier city on Tues­day is to be held in prison af­ter a judge de­cided he did not need to be sent to a psy­chi­atric in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>The man, who had been drunk, had shown psy­cho­log­i­cal ab­nor­mal­i­ties dur­ing and af­ter his ar­rest on Tues­day, said the Trier pros­e­cu­tor, adding that an ex­pert would ex­am­ine him and is­sue an of­fi­cial opin­ion.</p>
    <p>“A pre­lim­i­nary eval­u­a­tion finds no con­crete in­di­ca­tions to com­pletely ex­clude cul­pa­bil­ity,” said the pros­e­cu­tor, adding that the man was sus­pected of com­mit­ting five mur­ders and at­tempted mur­der and griev­ous bod­ily harm in a fur­ther 18 cases.</p>
    <p>“The ac­cused is sus­pected of hav­ing ran­domly and de­lib­er­ately driven at high speed in the pedes­trian zone in Trier... with a Land Rover, with the in­ten­tion of killing or at least in­jur­ing as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble,” said the pros­e­cu­tor.</p>
    <p>The mo­tive of the sus­pect, not named by pros­e­cu­tors but iden­ti­fied as Bernd W. by the me­dia, was still un­clear, said the pros­e­cu­tor, re­it­er­at­ing, how­ever, that ques­tion­ing so far had given no in­di­ca­tion</p>
    <p>of a po­lit­i­cal or reli­gious back­ground.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents and politi­cians wept and hugged as they placed flow­ers, can­dles and hand-writ­ten mes­sages to the vic­tims at the city’s</p>
    <p>land­mark Ro­man gate, Porta Ni­gra.</p>
    <p>“The pain of the mother who lost her child and her hus­band takes my voice away,” said RhinelandP­alati­nate state Premier Malu Dreyer, her voice break­ing.</p>
    <p>“There will never again be the laugh­ter of the fa­ther and the child. Oth­ers who have to mourn the dead feel the same way... they will have to carry this bur­den for the rest of their lives.”</p>
