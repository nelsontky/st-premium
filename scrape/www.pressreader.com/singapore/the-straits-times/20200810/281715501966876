    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has pushed back Ex­ec­u­tive Ship Man­age­ment’s busi­ness plans by two to three years, said its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor S.P. Singh.</p>
    <p>The firm’s sched­uled growth path has been dis­rupted even as the com­pany pre­pares for when the econ­omy re­bounds post-Covid-19, he added. Ex­ec­u­tive Ship Man­age­ment has more than 160 em­ploy­ees in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Ship man­age­ment does face a cas­cad­ing ef­fect from the global fall­out, es­pe­cially with the in­crease in op­er­a­tional costs, among oth­ers, Mr Singh said. “The in­dus­try has been hit by the eco­nomic fall­out. How­ever, as an es­sen­tial ser­vice, ship­ping has man­aged to con­tinue the global trade to the great re­lief of the na­tions at large.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany is cop­ing well with “the new nor­mal” though it is not busi­ness as usual, said Mr Singh. He added that “the man­age­ment has been able to en­sure health and safety as a pri­or­ity”.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive Ship Man­age­ment pro­vides trained crew as well as tech­ni­cal man­age­ment ser­vices to ship own­ers, among other ser­vices. It also owns and op­er­ates off­shore ships.</p>
    <p>Slower growth in the in­dus­try, crew re­lief, lo­gis­ti­cal sup­port – such as sup­ply of pro­vi­sions, stores and spares – as well as ship main­te­nance are among some of the chal­leng­ing is­sues the com­pany faces amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh noted that ship­ping had con­tin­ued with­out many is­sues in the ear­lier months of this year but “slowly the symp­toms (wors­ened)... with the crew get­ting locked down on board, far ex­ceed­ing their con­tracts”.</p>
    <p>The firm worked with other ship­ping com­pa­nies and the Mar­itime and Port Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore to send 87 ship crew mem­bers back to In­dia on a char­tered plane in June.</p>
    <p>The crew mem­bers had been work­ing on board ships when</p>
    <p>Covid-19 caused bor­ders to close. Ship crew could not dis­em­bark to go home, though their con­tracts had ended.</p>
    <p>Mr Singh said that the in­dus­try has been ar­rang­ing repa­tri­a­tion flights for sea­far­ers but more needs to be done, given the high num­ber of af­fected crew mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Co­or­di­nat­ing with the dif­fer­ent au­thor­i­ties for nu­mer­ous ap­provals and per­mis­sions re­quired for for­eign na­tion­als to en­ter coun­tries has been a daunt­ing and chal­leng­ing task, he added.</p>
    <p>His com­pany has a pro­gramme to keep its “crew en­gaged and keep them mo­ti­vated in or­der to con­tinue to op­er­ate the ships safely”, he added.</p>
    <p>It is also work­ing to en­sure that ship main­te­nance ser­vices and lo­gis­ti­cal sup­port re­main avail­able de­spite dis­rup­tions in the sup­ply of pro­vi­sions and that fact that stores have been af­fected.</p>
    <p>“We are in con­stant touch with the reg­u­la­tory au­thor­i­ties to iden­tify the best ways to re­solve th­ese sit­u­a­tions with re­mote au­dits and trou­bleshoot­ing, es­pe­cially when they are un­able to board the ships due to lo­cal rules and re­stric­tions,” Mr Singh said.</p>
