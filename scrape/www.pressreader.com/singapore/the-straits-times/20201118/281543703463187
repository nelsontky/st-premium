    <p>Tech­nol­ogy has been cen­tral to Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 re­sponse, and more broadly to the Gov­ern­ment’s work, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day dur­ing the Sin­ga­pore Tech Fo­rum. He added that bio­med­i­cal sci­ence has been key to un­der­stand­ing genomes and dis­ease pat­terns, and de­vel­op­ing tests and treatments.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy has been cen­tral to Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 re­sponse, and more broadly to the Gov­ern­ment’s work, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>PM Lee told a virtual au­di­ence at the Sin­ga­pore Tech Fo­rum that bio­med­i­cal sci­ence has been key to un­der­stand­ing genomes and dis­ease pat­terns, as well as de­vel­op­ing tests and treatments.</p>
    <p>In­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy has been just as crit­i­cal, for track­ing cases, analysing data, en­sur­ing com­pli­ance with stay-home no­tices and do­ing con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>He re­counted i n his key­note speech how con­tact trac­ing dur­ing the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome out­break in 2003 was man­ual and labour-in­ten­sive.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has i nvolved much larger num­bers and an ur­gent need to quar­an­tine close con­tacts.</p>
    <p>PM Lee pointed to three es­sen­tial so­lu­tions de­vel­oped by Sin­ga­pore: the Blue­tooth-based, open­source TraceTo­gether app and to­ken, check-in sys­tem SafeEn­try, and Vision, which in­te­grated ex­ist­ing gov­ern­ment data­bases to promptly is­sue quar­an­tine no­tices.</p>
    <p>“Our re­sponse was not flaw­less, we dis­cov­ered many blind spots as we worked it out,” he said. “Our IT sys­tems in the Gov­ern­ment had been built over the years, not all are fully up to date, and they don’t all work seam­lessly to­gether.”</p>
    <p>He cited how some sys­tems could be up­dated only three to four times daily, be­cause they were still us­ing older pro­grammes like Mi­crosoft Ex­cel spread­sheets to trans­fer in­for­ma­tion in batches, in­stead of be­ing con­tin­u­ously up­dated us­ing cur­rent techniques.</p>
    <p>“When cases are mul­ti­ply­ing, all th­ese de­lays and in­ef­fi­cien­cies make a dif­fer­ence,” he said.</p>
    <p>New prod­ucts like TraceTo­gether thus had to be rolled out in a vi­able, al­beit “far from pol­ished” state. But this showed Sin­ga­pore’s in-house ca­pa­bil­ity – as well as the im­por­tance of en­mesh­ing tech and op­er­a­tions work early on, while keep­ing the process it­er­a­tive and adap­tive, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>The even big­ger les­son, he said, was the recog­ni­tion of tech as a “com­mand func­tion” which all pub­lic ser­vice lead­ers must grasp and ap­pre­ci­ate. “Enough” lead­ers will have to be able to pro­vide tech­ni­cal lead­er­ship on com­plex en­gi­neer­ing projects, while ap­pre­ci­at­ing other so­cial and pol­icy as­pects.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a ques­tion-and-an­swer seg­ment after­wards, PM Lee said the pub­lic sec­tor’s se­nior man­age­ment was “fully sold” on the need to not just make use of tech but also change the way it does things.</p>
    <p>“The will is there... but I still wish we could go faster,” he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore could rise to the chal­lenge with the help of an en­vi­ron­ment that sup­ports sci­ence and tech, he said in his speech at the fo­rum or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Global Net­work and the Gov­ern­ment Tech­nol­ogy Agency.</p>
    <p>PM Lee then iden­ti­fied four en­vi­ron­men­tal fac­tors in Sin­ga­pore’s favour.</p>
    <p>To start with, Sin­ga­pore­ans are “tech-lit­er­ate”, with more smart­phone ac­counts in Sin­ga­pore than there are peo­ple.</p>
    <p>There is also good in­fra­struc­ture in place, with a na­tion­wide broad­band net­work pro­vid­ing high­speed In­ter­net con­nec­tion – a “life­saver” for the wel­fare of hun­dreds of thou­sands of mi­grant work­ers con­fined to their dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>He noted the Gov­ern­ment has also been build­ing up its IT en­gi­neer­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, while build­ing up Sin­ga­pore’s en­tire tech ecosys­tem and dig­i­tal in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“Many ma­jor tech com­pa­nies are now based here and they’re do­ing en­gi­neer­ing work, not just sales and mar­ket­ing,” he said. “(They are) cre­at­ing a vi­brant in­dus­try clus­ter and good jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Tech is an area where Sin­ga­pore can have a “nat­u­ral strength” in, he added. “If we can get it into our sys­tems – not just in­di­vid­ual apps and pro­grammes, but get it fully into our Gov­ern­ment, into the pri­vate sec­tor, into the way we op­er­ate and live, then it can be an en­dur­ing ad­van­tage for Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
