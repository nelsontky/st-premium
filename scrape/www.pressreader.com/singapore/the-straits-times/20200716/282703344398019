    <p>ADY AN CEL­E­BRATES SON’S</p>
    <p>FIRST BIRTH­DAY: Tai­wanese ac­tress Ady An has not been ac­tive in the en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try since she mar­ried Ma­cau ty­coon Levo Chan in 2017.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan is the chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Tak Chun Group, which owns and op­er­ates gam­ing clubs in ho­tels.</p>
    <p>An, 39, moved to Ma­cau with her hus­band af­ter her mar­riage and gave birth to a son in July last year. She nick­named her baby “66” as Mr Chan’s nick­name is “65”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, An posted on</p>
    <p>Weibo sev­eral pho­tos of her cel­e­brat­ing her son’s first birth­day with Mr Chan and their friends.</p>
    <p>In the pho­tos, the Chans were all decked in or­ange, with the baby’s face cov­ered by two emo­jis.</p>
    <p>An an­nounced last month that she is preg­nant with her sec­ond child. Her baby bump was vis­i­ble in the pho­tos even though she was wear­ing a loose-fit­ting</p>
    <p>T-shirt.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress, who has starred in tele­vi­sion se­ries such as The Out­siders (2004), Au­tumn’s Con­certo (2009) and Go, Sin­gle Lady (2014), wrote on Weibo, “How did time pass so fast? In the blink of an eye, you are al­ready a year old.</p>
    <p>“The year has wit­nessed your growth and mine. From a care­free Miss An, I’m now wor­ried mama. Your ar­rival means I now have less time for my­self and made me give up many things I had planned to do.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, mama feels that it is worth it as I get to see you grow up every day and record every mo­ment of your growth.”</p>
    <p>With the ar­rival of her sec­ond child, it is un­likely An will re­turn to act­ing soon.</p>
