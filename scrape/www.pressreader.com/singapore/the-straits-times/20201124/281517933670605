    <p>A wo­man who sued na­tional wa­ter agency PUB, af­ter she fell into a 1.8m-deep man­hole five years ago, has added her di­ag­no­sis of schizophre­nia in Fe­bru­ary this year to the list of in­juries she al­legedly suf­fered as a re­sult of the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Madam Chan Hui Peng, 47, be­lieves her hus­band was an evil spirit and that laser beams were be­ing shone into her con­do­minium unit, her l awyer told the High Court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr L. De­vada­son also told the court that his client, a char­tered ac­coun­tant, is no longer pur­su­ing her ini­tial claim of $20 mil­lion, which was based on the re­port of an ac­count­ing firm. She is now seek­ing about $5 mil­lion in dam­ages.</p>
    <p>She has sub­mit­ted thou­sands of pages of med­i­cal re­ports and clin­i­cal notes in a bid to show that, apart from a frac­tured an­kle and scrapes, the ac­ci­dent also caused her to suf­fer from post-trau­matic stress disorder (PTSD) and schizophre­nia.</p>
    <p>PUB has ac­cepted 70 per cent of the li­a­bil­ity for the ac­ci­dent, but dis­putes her claims for items that in­clude loss of fu­ture earn­ings and fu­ture med­i­cal ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Lawyer K. An­parasan, act­ing for PUB’s in­sur­ers, ar­gued that Madam Chan “has a pro­cliv­ity to ob­tain and amend med­i­cal ev­i­dence to her sat­is­fac­tion”. He said the de­fen­dant’s ex­perts will tes­tify she did not suf­fer from PTSD and that “there might have been a de­gree of em­bel­lish­ment”.</p>
    <p>“(Madam Chan) has made a moun­tain out of a mole­hill and has seized the op­por­tu­nity to cap­i­talise on the in­juries she al­legedly sus­tained be­cause of the ac­ci­dent.”</p>
    <p>He also noted sur­veil­lance by pri­vate in­ves­ti­ga­tors showed she could carry out daily ac­tiv­i­ties, in­clud­ing walk­ing up to 3.5km a day.</p>
    <p>Mr An­parasan ar­gued that she was “dis­hon­est” in for­mu­lat­ing her claim and had “con­cocted ev­i­dence with a hope of ob­tain­ing a wind­fall”.</p>
    <p>But Mr De­vada­son said Madam Chan was seek­ing “just com­pen­sa­tion” for her phys­i­cal and psy­cho­log­i­cal in­juries to “con­tinue her di­min­ished ex­is­tence with at least some mea­sure of dig­nity”.</p>
    <p>The court heard that on the morn­ing of Dec 1, 2015, Madam Chan ex­ited Ko­van MRT sta­tion and was walk­ing to­wards a row of shops to col­lect some birds’ nest.</p>
    <p>She did not see an open man­hole near Ko­van Res­i­dences and fell in feet first, land­ing on her but­tocks. Mr De­vada­son said a tree had cast a shadow over the man­hole and there was no cor­don or signs around it.</p>
    <p>Three PUB of­fi­cers who were stand­ing near the man­hole helped her out and drove her to seek med­i­cal help. Madam Chan spent five days at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal and was di­ag­nosed with trauma, bruises on her hip and an an­kle frac­ture. She then spent four months re­ha­bil­i­tat­ing in a com­mu­nity hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Her first com­plaint of a men­tal con­di­tion was recorded on March 17, 2016, when she told a doc­tor that she was fear­ful of holes.</p>
    <p>That year, she vis­ited the Na­tional Neu­ro­science In­sti­tute re­peat­edly for headaches.</p>
    <p>She was di­ag­nosed with PTSD af­ter start­ing ses­sions at the Bet­ter Life Psy­cho­log­i­cal Medicine Clinic on March 14, 2017.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber 2018, she be­gan fil­ing po­lice re­ports, com­plain­ing that people were talk­ing about her or spy­ing on her. In a re­port this year, she said she felt the heat from laser beams while she was on her bed.</p>
    <p>She was warded at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health twice – once in Fe­bru­ary af­ter she drank hand sani­tiser, and in June af­ter she threw a bam­boo pole out of the win­dow.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Madam Chan spoke softly but was com­posed when she was cross-ex­am­ined on the stand.</p>
    <p>Mr An­parasan con­tended that she was not work­ing at the time of the ac­ci­dent and had con­cocted ev­i­dence to jus­tify her claim for loss of earn­ings.</p>
    <p>In her suit, Madam Chan said she earned $11,500 a month at HP&S In­ter­na­tional, which turned out to be a dor­mant fam­ily com­pany.</p>
    <p>The lawyer pro­duced her pay cheque that she had signed her­self.</p>
    <p>He also pro­duced a com­pany let­ter, signed by her mother-in-law and typed by her hus­band Sim Kuang Jui on the day of the ac­ci­dent, putting her on no-pay leave.</p>
    <p>On that same day, the com­pany’s reg­is­tered ad­dress was changed from Madam Chan’s mat­ri­mo­nial home at St Ni­cholas View to her mother-in-law’s Bis­han home.</p>
    <p>Madam Chan dis­agreed the ad­dress was changed so that she can­not be linked to HP&S. She said the change was to make sure “the right per­son gets doc­u­ments from the Gov­ern­ment”.</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues.</p>
