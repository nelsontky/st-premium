    <p>Af­ter a decade of hound­ing at­tack­ers, na­tional net­baller Chen Lili’s tow­er­ing pres­ence will no longer be felt in the de­fen­sive cir­cle.</p>
    <p>The 1.96m de­fender has called time on her in­ter­na­tional ca­reer, which has seen her amass 82 caps since she was re­cruited from China in 2010 by Net­ball Sin­ga­pore (NS).</p>
    <p>Chen, 30, cited the un­cer­tain­ties brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic as one of the main rea­sons for her de­ci­sion to step away. She has also strug­gled with in­jury in re­cent years – she had surgery on her right an­te­rior cru­ci­ate lig­a­ment in June 2019 – and was un­sure if she would be able to re­cover her form.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the out­break hit, she had con­tem­plated re­tir­ing af­ter the Asian Net­ball Cham­pi­onship. The tour­na­ment was sched­uled to take place in South Korea in De­cem­ber but has since been sus­pended.</p>
    <p>Un­sure of when the next com­pe­ti­tion would be, Chen, who wants to pur­sue a ca­reer in teach­ing or coach­ing, felt that this was the best time to hang up her na­tional jer­sey.</p>
    <p>She said yes­ter­day: “This has been my whole life for the past 10 years. I feel sad to leave my friends and Net­ball Sin­ga­pore. I will miss play­ing the games but I will cheer for them from the side­lines.”</p>
    <p>When the Hei­longjiang na­tive ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore in 2010, she knew only a smat­ter­ing of English words such as ‘hi’, ‘bye’ and ‘thank you’. The for­mer bas­ket­baller also had to pick up net­ball from scratch, but Chen, now flu­ent in the lan­guage, was quick to learn the ropes.</p>
    <p>In a ca­reer that has seen her com­pete at mul­ti­ple tour­na­ments, she counts vic­tory at the 2015 SEA Games on home soil as one of her favourite mo­ments.</p>
    <p>“That was the first SEA Games gold medal for Sin­ga­pore and I got to play with my friends. The crowd sup­port­ing us also made it very mem­o­rable,” she said.</p>
    <p>She also fea­tured at the 2015 Net­ball World Cup in Syd­ney, the 2017 SEA Games in Malaysia and four Asian Net­ball Cham­pi­onships, lift­ing the tro­phy in 2012 and 2014.</p>
    <p>NS pres­i­dent Jessica Tan paid tribute to Chen, say­ing yes­ter­day: “She has been an in­te­gral part of the team and she will be missed, es­pe­cially in de­fence. While she’s re­tired, we hope she will stay close to net­ball.”</p>
    <p>Chen, who coaches River Val­ley</p>
    <p>Pri­mary School, Yuan Ching Sec­ondary School and Catholic Ju­nior Col­lege, has ap­plied to sev­eral lo­cal in­sti­tu­tions to pur­sue a de­gree in Chi­nese stud­ies or phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion. She hopes to be­come a teacher in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>She has been coach­ing for about six years and added: “I want to pass my pas­sion to my stu­dents. I quite en­joy my time with the kids, teach­ing them skills and look­ing at them go from hav­ing no ex­pe­ri­ence to play­ing net­ball.”</p>
    <p>6 Years Chen Lili has been coach­ing stu­dents in net­ball.</p>
