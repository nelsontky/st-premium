    <p>About $60 mil­lion a year in pub­lic funds goes to­wards sub­si­dis­ing oper­a­tions for a stretch of the MRT Down­town Line (DTL) con­nect­ing Bukit Pan­jang to the city, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said.</p>
    <p>He re­vealed this fig­ure in re­sponse to a Bukit Pan­jang res­i­dent who had sub­mit­ted a pe­ti­tion with more than 2,000 names ask­ing the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) to re­scind its plans to re­move some bus ser­vices from the area and change the routes of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail re­ply ob­tained by The Sun­day Times on Fri­day, Mr Ong noted that the Gov­ern­ment built the DTL – which runs from Bukit Pan­jang to the Expo in the east – at a cost of $21 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“It is not a prof­itable line, so the Gov­ern­ment uses pub­lic funds to sub­sidise the run­ning of the line, and op­er­a­tion sub­sidy comes up to over $60 mil­lion a year for the DTL stretch con­nect­ing Bukit Pan­jang to the city,” he said.</p>
    <p>At the same time, rid­er­ship on bus ser­vices that run par­al­lel to the DTL has fallen sig­nif­i­cantly, he said.</p>
    <p>For bus ser­vice 171, which will see its route changed, rid­er­ship fell by more than 30 per cent from 2015 to last year. For bus ser­vice 700, which will be re­moved, it was more than a 50 per cent drop in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said ser­vices 171 and 700 are also be­ing sub­sidised, cost­ing tax­pay­ers $14 mil­lion a year.</p>
    <p>“If the bus ser­vices are the only pub­lic trans­port op­tion avail­able to res­i­dents, LTA is able to jus­tify the pub­lic spend­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But with the DTL avail­able, LTA needs to ex­er­cise pru­dence in pub­lic spend­ing, and is hence mak­ing the changes an­nounced.”</p>
    <p>The same $60 mil­lion sub­sidy fig­ure for the DTL was cited by Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port Chee Hong Tat in a Face­book post on Fri­day evening.</p>
    <p>SBS Tran­sit (SBST), the sub­sidiary of trans­port gi­ant Com­fortDelGro, beat ri­val SMRT to land the con­tract with a bid of about $1.6 bil­lion over 19 years from 2013. An­nu­alised, the li­cence charge works out to be around $84.2 mil­lion a year.</p>
    <p>Un­der the li­cence charge struc­ture, if SBST’s rev­enue falls be­low a cer­tain thresh­old, it pays a smaller fee to LTA.</p>
    <p>Asked why tax­pay­ers were sub­si­dis­ing the run­ning of a line which a pri­vate com­pany had un­der­taken to op­er­ate in a com­pet­i­tive ten­der, the LTA said the sum was nec­es­sary to make up for a short­fall in funds nec­es­sary for the even­tual as­set re­place­ment of the line.</p>
    <p>“Un­der the New Rail Fi­nanc­ing Frame­work (NRFF), the op­er­a­tor pays the Gov­ern­ment a li­cence charge for the use of op­er­at­ing as­sets, such as trains and sig­nalling sys­tem. This goes to­wards their even­tual re­place­ment and re­newal,” an LTA spokesman said.</p>
    <p>“As the DTL is not a prof­itable line, the li­cence charge paid by SBST is in­suf­fi­cient to cover the an­nual de­pre­ci­a­tion and hence the even­tual re­place­ment of the DTL op­er­at­ing as­sets. The dif­fer­ence be­tween the an­nual de­pre­ci­a­tion and li­cence charge paid is the Gov­ern­ment’s sub­sidy for DTL oper­a­tions. This comes up to about $60 mil­lion a year for the DTL stretch con­nect­ing Bukit Pan­jang to the city.”</p>
    <p>The DTL is the first line op­er­ated un­der the NRFF, where the Gov­ern­ment owns all fixed and op­er­at­ing as­sets, and the op­er­a­tor fo­cuses on main­te­nance and meet­ing ser­vice stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Last Au­gust, SBST re­ported that aver­age fares for the DTL had risen by 7.7 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter of the year, while aver­age daily rid­er­ship had grown by 6.9 per cent to 467,000 trips – close to the pro­jected 500,000.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts were ex­pect­ing the line to break even this year. This fore­cast, how­ever, was made be­fore the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Over­all, pub­lic trans­port rid­er­ship is now at half the vol­ume it was be­fore the out­break.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the $60 mil­lion sub­sidy, Sin­ga­pore Uni­ver­sity of So­cial Sciences trans­port econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira called for more trans­parency on rail fund­ing.</p>
    <p>“We know that on a sys­tem-wide ba­sis, op­er­at­ing costs are now sub­sidised for rail but there is lit­tle in­for­ma­tion put out about the ba­sis for these cal­cu­la­tions, where sub­si­dies are go­ing, to whom, etc.”</p>
    <p>In the case of the DTL, Dr Th­e­seira said, “we should be open” about how the rev­enue short­fall came about.</p>
    <p>“We can ac­cept that it is nec­es­sary to res­cue a com­mer­cial op­er­a­tor which made a mis­take in bid­ding – es­pe­cially if fac­tors that caused the fi­nan­cial dis­tress are be­yond op­er­a­tor’s con­trol – but we don’t know how ex­actly it came about and to what ex­tent it is be­yond op­er­a­tor con­trol,” said the former Nom­i­nated MP.</p>
