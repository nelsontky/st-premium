    <p>My five-year-old poo­dle Yoyo (right) has been bit­ing her paws since she was a puppy. How do I solve the prob­lem?</p>
    <p>Teresa Fong</p>
    <p>This is a rel­a­tively com­mon prob­lem among dogs and there could be a few rea­sons.</p>
    <p>First, I sug­gest Yoyo visit her vet for an ex­am­i­na­tion. A close check of the paws is needed to en­sure there are no for­eign bod­ies such as grass seeds and sharp ob­jects that could have in­jured or are ir­ri­tat­ing the paw.</p>
    <p>Does Yoyo also lick or bite other parts of her body? Are there signs of itch that ac­com­pa­nies her bit­ing be­hav­iour?</p>
    <p>The parts Yoyo is bit­ing, lick­ing or scratch­ing will help your vet as­sess if this is a lo­calised prob­lem or a more gen­er­alised con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>A com­mon cause for a dog bit­ing/lick­ing its paw is a par­a­site in­fec­tion (for ex­am­ple, mites), which could be re­solved with reg­u­lar anti-par­a­sitic treat­ments.</p>
    <p>An­other com­mon cause is an al­lergy.</p>
    <p>For a food al­lergy, ex­pect to see a more gen­er­alised itch on var­i­ous parts of the body.</p>
    <p>Con­tact al­lergy – for ex­am­ple, due to ex­po­sure to cer­tain chem­i­cals or pol­lens – tends to be more lo­calised at the ar­eas where the skin is in con­tact with the al­ler­gen.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a dog’s feet may flare up af­ter walk­ing through a grass patch where there is pollen it is allergic to.</p>
    <p>Some­times, con­stant lick­ing or bit­ing of paws could be at­trib­uted to be­havioural causes as well, such as sep­a­ra­tion anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ing the cause of the anx­i­ety can help iden­tify a suit­able so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>This takes close ob­ser­va­tion of the pet by the owner. Of­ten, en­rich­ment and pos­i­tive re­in­force­ment train­ing is needed to ad­dress such be­havioural causes.</p>
    <p>Fre­quent lick­ing/bit­ing of the paws can also cause sec­ondary bac­te­ria or yeast in­fec­tion due to the area be­ing moist. Your vet will be able to ad­vise the treat­ment needed if there are signs of such in­fec­tion.</p>
