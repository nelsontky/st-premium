    <p>As Covid-19 rav­ages lives and economies around the world, Sin­ga­pore will have to adapt to change while stay­ing true to the val­ues that helped it progress over the years, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day at the start of a week-long de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress at a new term of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>As Covid-19 rav­ages lives and economies around the world, Sin­ga­pore will have to adapt to change while stay­ing true to the val­ues that helped it progress over the years, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day at the start of a week-long de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress in a new term of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes re­main­ing open to trade, in­vest­ment and tal­ent as a key global node with deep con­nec­tions to the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>Do­ing so would help draw in­vest­ments and cre­ate good jobs that Sin­ga­pore­ans can com­pete fairly for. That, he ar­gued, was the best way to serve the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“Our start­ing point is that our eco­nomic strate­gies must serve the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he said.</p>
    <p>That is why man­power poli­cies, such as on Em­ploy­ment Passes, are be­ing adapted to en­sure that the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans are up­held in the face of eco­nomic dis­rup­tion. But he warned against the temp­ta­tion to turn in­wards.</p>
    <p>“The best way is to en­sure that this lit­tle red dot – with no nat­u­ral re­sources of any kind, but with a de­ter­mined, hard-work­ing, for­ward-look­ing peo­ple – re­mains use­ful and rel­e­vant to the world,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>“We do this by keep­ing our econ­omy vi­brant and com­pet­i­tive, so that Sin­ga­pore­ans and other peo­ple choose to be here, to invest and do busi­ness, thereby cre­at­ing good jobs and op­por­tu­ni­ties for all of us.”</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment will re­dou­ble its ef­forts to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore work­ers will be armed with the skills to grab the op­por­tu­ni­ties that come their way, help­ing them achieve their fullest po­ten­tial, Mr Heng added.</p>
    <p>Some of the key points in Mr Heng’s speech – adapt­ing to change and strength­en­ing the Sin­ga­pore core of the work­force – were also themes that dom­i­nated dis­cus­sion on day one of the de­bate in the House.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing up the theme, labour MPs made plain that dis­crim­i­na­tion against lo­cal work­ers will not be tol­er­ated.</p>
    <p>Mr Patrick Tay (Pi­o­neer), who de­liv­ered the open­ing ad­dress for the de­bate, called on the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) to con­sider fur­ther rais­ing the min­i­mum qual­i­fy­ing salaries for Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) hold­ers for two sec­tors, in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy and pro­fes­sional ser­vices. His call came days af­ter the Govern­ment an­nounced the sec­ond rise in salary thresh­olds of EP hold­ers this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Tay, who is an as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress, also urged the Govern­ment to con­sider tougher mea­sures such as an EP quota.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Man­power Tan See Leng em­pha­sised that Sin­ga­pore “will not al­low com­pa­nies to prac­tise wan­ton dis­crim­i­na­tion against our lo­cal tal­ent”, and that MOM has been step­ping up its surveil­lance and en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>But he cau­tioned against cur­tail­ing man­power sup­ply through mea­sures like a quota sys­tem, which he said is not a long-term so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party chief Pri­tam Singh called on the Govern­ment to go fur­ther, such as with an anti-dis­crim­i­na­tion law that will pe­nalise egre­gious em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>De­liv­er­ing his maiden speech as Sin­ga­pore’s first for­mally des­ig­nated Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, Mr Singh also charged that the lack of in­for­ma­tion on a com­plex is­sue like for­eign man­power num­bers has cre­ated “a vac­uum (that) has given space for a more toxic con­ver­sa­tion to fer­ment”.</p>
    <p>Re­it­er­at­ing his call for more data,</p>
    <p>Mr Singh said how much the op­po­si­tion can do de­pends on the quan­tity and qual­ity of in­for­ma­tion the Govern­ment puts out. He also urged the Govern­ment to “put out more in­for­ma­tion with­out be­ing asked to”.</p>
    <p>Both Peo­ple’s Action Party and op­po­si­tion MPs also touched on Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob’s point in her speech last week that Sin­ga­pore must evolve its pol­i­tics, and the need to find a way to de­liver ef­fec­tive govern­ment while ac­com­mo­dat­ing the grow­ing di­ver­sity of views here.</p>
    <p>Leader of the House In­dra­nee Ra­jah cau­tioned against greater di­ver­sity of views and more ro­bust de­bates in Par­lia­ment lead­ing to greater po­lar­i­sa­tion among Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“Ex­pe­ri­ence else­where shows that unity in di­ver­sity is not an as­sured out­come,” she said. “Our goal should be to har­ness this di­ver­sity of views in a con­struc­tive man­ner, so that we can as a Par­lia­ment bet­ter serve the in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans and Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>DPM Heng put it this way: “This House must ful­fil its duty, to ar­tic­u­late and de­bate pol­icy op­tions, to build a bet­ter life for our peo­ple, and to ad­vance Sin­ga­pore’s place in the world. This is the man­date that has been en­trusted to us by Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“I trust that all of us, whether in Govern­ment or the op­po­si­tion, will share this com­mon sense of mis­sion, to serve in the best in­ter­ests of Sin­ga­pore­ans and Sin­ga­pore.”</p>

Even as Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore adapts to change, it must re&#xAD;main open to trade, in&#xAD;vest&#xAD;ment and tal&#xAD;ent as a key global node with deep con&#xAD;nec&#xAD;tions to the rest of the world, he said, as do&#xAD;ing so would help draw in&#xAD;vest&#xAD;ments and cre&#xAD;ate good jobs that Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore&#xAD;ans can com&#xAD;pete fairly for.</p>
