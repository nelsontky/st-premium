    <p>HONG KONG • It was the hottest ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) in town. Now, Nongfu Spring’s stock surge is turn­ing its founder into China’s sec­ond-rich­est per­son.</p>
    <p>Shares of the bot­tled-wa­ter maker jumped as much as 85 per cent and traded up 55 per cent by the mid­day break in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The de­but is on pace to be­come the city’s fourth-best on record among firms that raised more than US$1 bil­lion (S$1.37 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The surge is push­ing the net worth of Mr Zhong Shan­shan, who owns 84 per cent of the firm he founded in 1996, to over US$51 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex. He is now the wealth­i­est per­son in China af­ter Alibaba Group co-founder Jack Ma, and the third-rich­est in Asia.</p>
    <p>The IPO was a smash hit in Hong Kong, so much so that the re­tail por­tion was over­sub­scribed by over 1,100 times and Nongfu in­creased the num­ber of shares al­lo­cated to the pub­lic. That was af­ter it priced at the top end of a mar­keted range.</p>
    <p>De­spite the coro­n­avirus out­break, the IPO market in China and Hong Kong has re­mained vi­brant this year. Com­pa­nies raised al­most US$60 bil­lion via new share sales this year, more than dou­ble in the same pe­riod last year, data com­piled by Bloomberg shows. Hong Kong is be­com­ing an in­creas­ingly pop­u­lar list­ing venue amid United States-China ten­sions, while de­mand from re­tail in­vestors has been surg­ing as am­ple liq­uid­ity en­cour­aged banks to lend. In China, IPOs pro­duced at least 24 new bil­lion­aires in the first half of the year.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhong, also known in lo­cal me­dia as the Lone Wolf for es­chew­ing busi­ness groups and pol­i­tics, is the only ty­coon among China’s five rich­est peo­ple who is not from the tech or real es­tate in­dus­try, which typ­i­cally dom­i­nate the rank­ing.</p>
    <p>His for­tune was boosted in April when Beijing Wan­tai Bi­o­log­i­cal Phar­macy En­ter­prise, a com­pany he ac­quired a con­trol­ling stake in al­most two decades ago, went pub­lic in Shang­hai. The stock has surged more than 2,100 per cent since then.</p>
    <p>That is quite a turn­around for a man whose school­ing got in­ter­rupted dur­ing the na­tion’s Cul­tural Revo­lu­tion and who worked in con­struc­tion and jour­nal­ism be­fore turn­ing to bot­tled wa­ter.</p>
    <p>Now, Mr Zhong is shar­ing his suc­cess: The Nongfu list­ing is also cre­at­ing at least 68 new mil­lion­aires. Dozens of them be­came share­hold­ers just last year, when he and his hold­ing com­pany trans­ferred 0.79 per cent of Nongfu as part of a staff in­cen­tive pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma has topped China’s rich­est per­son list for most of the past six years, af­ter Alibaba went pub­lic in the US. The list­ing of his Ant Group is poised to boost his for­tune fur­ther – his stake would be worth US$25 bil­lion if it achieves the US$225 bil­lion val­u­a­tion peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter have said it is tar­get­ing.</p>
