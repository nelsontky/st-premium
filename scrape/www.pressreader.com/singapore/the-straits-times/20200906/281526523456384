    <p>In Par­lia­ment last week, we wit­nessed a spir­ited and im­pas­sioned de­bate be­tween Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and the Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam Singh of the Work­ers’ Party on the is­sues of tac­ti­cal vot­ing and free rid­ing – which sub­se­quently be­came the sub­jects of heated de­bate on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>How can we make sense of the rel­e­vance of these con­cepts in Sin­ga­pore pol­i­tics?</p>
    <p>In eco­nomics, a free rider is some­one who does not pay for a pub­lic good that is non-ex­clud­able (be­cause it ben­e­fits ev­ery­one in a group) and non-ri­val­rous (be­cause its use by one per­son does not pre­clude oth­ers from us­ing it) but plans to ben­e­fit from it.</p>
    <p>Free rid­ers abound in the real world.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, there are work­ers who do not join a union, but ben­e­fit from the pro-worker poli­cies that the union ne­go­ti­ates. There are peo­ple who pay no or very low taxes, but ben­e­fit from the pub­lic in­fra­struc­ture that taxes fi­nance. And there are coun­tries that do lit­tle or noth­ing to mit­i­gate cli­mate change, but ben­e­fit from the mit­i­gat­ing mea­sures of other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In some of these cases, the free rid­ers do not even know they are free rid­ers, so free rid­ing is not nec­es­sar­ily ill-in­ten­tioned, nor is the term pe­jo­ra­tive.</p>
    <p>But it be­comes a prob­lem when it leads to the non-pro­duc­tion, or non-pro­vi­sion, of pub­lic goods or ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Thus, in the ex­am­ples above, if few or no work­ers join a union, it would be ren­dered tooth­less in any ne­go­ti­a­tion. If hardly any­body pays taxes, in­fra­struc­ture won’t get built. And if too many coun­tries do not do any­thing to mit­i­gate cli­mate change, a cli­mate cri­sis could oc­cur.</p>
    <p>But while free rid­ing is sim­ple enough to un­der­stand in an eco­nomic con­text, when it gets trans­ferred to other realms, such as pol­i­tics, and es­pe­cially vot­ing, things get more com­pli­cated.</p>
    <p>Take the case of tac­ti­cal vot­ing, which PM Lee al­luded to when he pointed out that some peo­ple voted for the op­po­si­tion know­ing full well that most oth­ers would vote for the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP), which would end up form­ing the Govern­ment – the out­come that they ac­tu­ally wanted.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested that such op­po­si­tion vot­ers were “free rid­ers”, which trig­gered much push­back from op­po­si­tion MPs as well as dis­cus­sion on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Be­fore ex­am­in­ing the va­lid­ity of the “free rider” claim in this con­text, it is worth fo­cus­ing on the phe­nom­e­non of tac­ti­cal vot­ing, on which there is a rich lit­er­a­ture in pub­lic choice eco­nomics as well as po­lit­i­cal sci­ence.</p>
    <p>Tac­ti­cal vot­ing is a fact of life in all “first-past-the-post” elec­toral sys­tems, which pre­vail in about one-third of coun­tries, in­clud­ing the United States, the United King­dom, Canada, In­dia, Malaysia, Sin­ga­pore and many other coun­tries of the Com­mon­wealth.</p>
    <p>In such a sys­tem, where can­di­dates can get elected even with­out win­ning a ma­jor­ity of votes – so long as they get more than the other can­di­dates – there are count­less ex­am­ples of vot­ers who opt for a party that is not their first choice, for tac­ti­cal rea­sons. This is es­pe­cially the case where vot­ers are po­larised over one or more is­sues.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in Bri­tain’s Brexit-dom­i­nated gen­eral elec­tion last year, a sur­vey by the UK’s Elec­toral Re­form So­ci­ety found that al­most one-third of vot­ers voted tac­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>Many anti-Brexit Labour Party sup­port­ers voted for Lib­eral Demo­crat can­di­dates in their con­stituen­cies be­cause they thought Labour had no chance, and that a vote for the Lib-Dems was the best hope of pre­vent­ing the pro-Brexit Con­ser­va­tives from win­ning, thereby re­duc­ing the chances of Brexit.</p>
    <p>There were even web­sites ad­vis­ing vot­ers on how to vote tac­ti­cally, based on the rel­a­tive strength of dif­fer­ent po­lit­i­cal par­ties in dif­fer­ent con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, there have no doubt been in­stances of tac­ti­cal vot­ing as well, and not only in the most re­cent July 10 gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The mo­tives for such vot­ing be­hav­iour are hard to fathom and may not al­ways be ra­tional.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it is pos­si­ble that de­spite want­ing the PAP to win the elec­tion, a cer­tain voter de­cided to vote for an op­po­si­tion party can­di­date in a PAP-safe con­stituency not be­cause he be­lieved in the can­di­date or thought the can­di­date had a chance of win­ning, but be­cause he viewed vot­ing as an act of self-ex­pres­sion and wanted his vote to count (ra­tio­nal­is­ing that a vote for the PAP would be a wasted vote).</p>
    <p>But if there was a close con­test, the same voter would have voted for the PAP. In the case of this voter, opt­ing for the op­po­si­tion can­di­date in the PAP-safe con­stituency could ar­guably be char­ac­terised as free rid­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, other vot­ers may have voted tac­ti­cally for a quite dif­fer­ent rea­son: While they may have wanted the PAP to win the elec­tion, they may have be­lieved that it would pro­vide a more ef­fec­tive and re­spon­sive govern­ment if there were more op­po­si­tion voices in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>This in­deed was the elec­toral pitch made by op­po­si­tion par­ties dur­ing the hus­tings, and sev­eral vot­ers might have been per­suaded.</p>
    <p>They can­not be con­sid­ered free rid­ers, be­cause they voted for an out­come that they be­lieved would help pro­duce not just a PAP govern­ment, but a PAP govern­ment and Par­lia­ment more in sync with their views and pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>There­fore mo­tives are im­por­tant in de­ter­min­ing the ex­tent of free rid­ing in tac­ti­cal vot­ing be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>But the prob­lem is that we do not know what peo­ple’s mo­tives were, or how much tac­ti­cal vot­ing took place. This also makes the re­sults of elec­tions in which there was tac­ti­cal vot­ing hard to in­ter­pret: Politi­cians don’t get a clear sig­nal of what the elec­torate re­ally wants.</p>
    <p>Can free rid­ing be con­trolled or elim­i­nated?</p>
    <p>One way to do this is to im­pose penal­ties on po­ten­tial free rid­ers. In eco­nomics, this usu­ally takes the form of taxes or charges that all re­cip­i­ents of pub­lic goods are re­quired to pay.</p>
    <p>In pol­i­tics, penal­ties could take the form of in­cum­bent po­lit­i­cal par­ties with­hold­ing or de­lay­ing ben­e­fits – such as hous­ing up­grad­ing – for op­po­si­tion-con­trolled precincts (which has hap­pened be­fore), which might have the ef­fect of dis­cour­ag­ing tac­ti­cal vot­ing.</p>
    <p>But this can also have po­lit­i­cal costs and even back­fire, by cre­at­ing re­sent­ment against the in­cum­bents, not only in the precincts af­fected but also in other con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>In an ideal world, vot­ers should, as PM Lee sug­gested, vote “sin­cerely, hon­estly, in ac­cor­dance with what they re­ally want, to pro­duce a re­sult which matches their true in­ten­tions”.</p>
    <p>But as rea­son­able as this sounds, in any first-past-the-post vot­ing sys­tem, it is a tough ask. There will al­ways be some amount of tac­ti­cal vot­ing, and maybe even free rid­ing.</p>
    <p>And this does cre­ate the risk that PM Lee flagged – that if peo­ple vote tac­ti­cally, “the con­se­quence must be that one day, they will get the re­sult which they marked the X for, but which they did not in­tend”.</p>
    <p>He also posed this crit­i­cal ques­tion, worth pon­der­ing: At what point does a vote for a stronger op­po­si­tion re­sult in a vote for a dif­fer­ent govern­ment?</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, none of this has come to pass, not yet at least.</p>
    <p>The only way to elim­i­nate the prob­lems and risks as­so­ci­ated with tac­ti­cal vot­ing is to switch to a vot­ing sys­tem of pro­por­tional rep­re­sen­ta­tion, where par­lia­men­tary rep­re­sen­ta­tion is de­ter­mined by the pop­u­lar vote. Only this would en­sure a re­sult that closely matches vot­ers’ true pref­er­ences.</p>
    <p>How­ever, sys­tems of pro­por­tional rep­re­sen­ta­tion have their own prob­lems, such as a ten­dency to pro­duce in­de­ci­sive, multi-party coali­tion gov­ern­ments, and can even en­able ex­trem­ist par­ties to be rep­re­sented in Par­lia­ment – as has hap­pened, for in­stance, in some coun­tries of the Euro­pean Union. Pol­icy out­comes from such coali­tions tend to re­flect nec­es­sary com­pro­mises to form a govern­ment or get leg­is­la­tion passed, some­times far re­moved from what any party promised its vot­ers.</p>
    <p>So no elec­toral sys­tem is per­fect. Sin­ga­pore’s first-past-the-post sys­tem has, by and large, worked well so far. Tac­ti­cal vot­ing and free rid­ing are risks that it might have to live with. But vot­ers, like buy­ers, would do well to be aware of these in­her­ent risks, as PM Lee flagged, when they cast their bal­lots.</p>
