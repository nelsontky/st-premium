    <p>He is tall, fair and oh so hand­some.</p>
    <p>His soul­ful gaze and sweet smile can make you melt, es­pe­cially as his tim­ing is al­ways spot-on – whether in turn­ing up just when you need him, or mak­ing an adorable fool of him­self to make you smile.</p>
    <p>He is sin­gle-minded in lov­ing you and sin­gle-hearted in pam­per­ing you to the heav­ens.</p>
    <p>Meet the ro­man­tic Korean oppa – lit­er­ally older brother – as we know him in the dra­mas.</p>
    <p>Whether it is the col­lege pro­fes­sor played by Kim Soo-hyun in 2013’s My Love From The Star, the army cap­tain played by</p>
    <p>Song Joong-ki in De­scen­dants Of The Sun (2016), or the model played by Park Bo-gum in</p>
    <p>Record Of Youth, th­ese lead­ing men spark hope in women’s hearts that fan­tasy is just around the cor­ner.</p>
    <p>So, is the real-life Korean oppa just as ro­man­tic?</p>
    <p>I’m sorry to burst your bub­ble, K-drama fan, such per­fec­tion only ex­ists in la-la land.</p>
    <p>How do I know? Well, I am mar­ried to a Korean guy, and I have stopped wish­ing he would stylishly knock my phone out of my hand and tie my shoelaces like Song’s char­ac­ter did in De­scen­dants, or dance with me in the rain and knot his scarf around my neck to keep me warm, like Park’s char­ac­ter in Record.</p>
    <p>I have also given up on be­ing sur­prised by flow­ers and choco­lates on Valen­tine’s Day, or any other sweet ges­tures con­cocted by scriptwrit­ers, who are clearly evil­do­ers toy­ing with hu­man hearts.</p>
    <p>Mind you, I do get gifts, but they are prac­ti­cal tributes such as a vac­uum cleaner, air hu­mid­i­fier and wire­less phone charger – items he help­fully thinks I need.</p>
    <p>Thought­ful? Yes. Ro­man­tic? Not so much.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 11 years of mar­riage, five of them spent liv­ing in Seoul, and one daugh­ter, I have come to re­alise that the Korean guy por­trayed so de­sir­ably in the dra­mas is ac­tu­ally not that dif­fer­ent from your av­er­age Sin­ga­porean guy, al­beit, a lot more vain.</p>
    <p>Here are five lessons I’ve learnt, which I hope will be use­ful for any­one dream­ing of snag­ging their own oppa:</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>MORE PRAG­MATIC THAN RO­MAN­TIC</p>
    <p>When it comes to af­fairs of the heart, the Korean oppa is re­ally more prag­matic than ro­man­tic.</p>
    <p>Sure, if he wants to im­press you and win you over, he can pull out all the stops, some­times pick­ing up a trick or two from the dra­mas.</p>
    <p>He can con­stantly praise how yepo (Korean for beau­ti­ful) you are, and tell you how much he sarang­hae (love you).</p>
    <p>But he does it mainly be­cause he knows it is ex­pected of him.</p>
    <p>Herein lies a key Korean con­cept that you must grasp in or­der to con­quer your oppa – nunchi (lit­er­ally eye mea­sure).</p>
    <p>Nunchi, ac­cord­ing to Amer­i­can-Korean au­thor Euny Hong, is the “art of un­der­stand­ing what peo­ple are think­ing and feel­ing”, and re­act­ing in a way that will be viewed pos­i­tively by oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Call it EQ. Kore­ans are trained to pos­sess and demon­strate good nunchi, as it is said to hold the key to suc­cess and hap­pi­ness.</p>
    <p>So if the oppa presents you with flow­ers for an an­niver­sary, it is prob­a­bly be­cause he knows it is the right thing to do and that you may be up­set if he doesn’t, which won’t turn out so well for him.</p>
    <p>In fact, a Sin­ga­porean friend said she gets flow­ers only af­ter a ma­jor fight with her Korean hus­band – his way of mak­ing peace.</p>
    <p>Prag­ma­tism is at work here, not ro­mance.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>HIS DARK SIDE</p>
    <p>As the re­la­tion­ship deep­ens, you will come to re­alise that ev­ery­thing that you love about him has a dark side.</p>
    <p>En­joy how he lav­ishes praise on you? He will fly into a rage just as pas­sion­ately.</p>
    <p>Love how he tries to pro­tect you, even if it’s just cross­ing the road? It can feel over­bear­ing, es­pe­cially when you’re no wall­flower.</p>
    <p>He pam­pers you like a princess when you’re out and about? Then you will need to treat him like a king at home. The dark side is usu­ally well hid­den at the start of a re­la­tion­ship, but you can be sure it will rear its head even­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>Most Korean men, you see, grow up be­ing spoilt rot­ten by their moth­ers. He is raised like a prince while his sis­ter, if he has any, will be treated like a maid.</p>
    <p>So he will nat­u­rally ex­pect royal treat­ment from you, es­pe­cially once the hon­ey­moon is over.</p>
    <p>An­other Sin­ga­porean friend tells me she has to serve her Korean hus­band wa­ter when he comes home from work, as he won’t get a drink for him­self. That’s how spoilt he is. Yet she puts up with it be­cause he is, af­ter all, the sole bread­win­ner of the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>VAN­ITY RULES</p>
    <p>South Korea has very rigid beauty stan­dards, which drive both women and men to go to great lengths to look good.</p>
    <p>Whether tall, fair and hand­some – or not – the Korean oppa is likely to be vain and will spend an in­or­di­nate amount of time preen­ing in front of the mir­ror.</p>
    <p>He is also more open-minded about beauty pro­ce­dures, be they a man­i­cure, eye­brow tat­too or dou­ble eye­lid surgery.</p>
    <p>In fact, he takes so much pride in look­ing good, he will ex­pect a du­ti­ful girl­friend to no­tice ev­ery small change in his phys­i­cal ap­pear­ance. If he shows up with a new hair­cut, re­mem­ber to ex­claim, “Oppa meori meo­jyeoyo” (“oppa hair cool”) to avoid a sulk. Re­mem­ber nunchi?</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>FLAIR FOR DRAMA</p>
    <p>The Korean oppa is ex­pres­sive with a nat­u­ral flair for drama. On good days, he comes across as can­did and an­i­mated, mak­ing you laugh with his silli­ness.</p>
    <p>But on bad days, es­pe­cially when fight­ing with his part­ner, he can be­come overly emo­tional and start mak­ing a moun­tain out of a mole­hill. That is when you need to give him space and let him calm down, and re­sume his chirpy self.</p>
    <p>A lit­tle agyeo – a cutesy dis­play of af­fec­tion – will go a long way. The oppa loves it.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>HIS BIG EGO</p>
    <p>Given South Korea’s deep-seated cul­ture of hi­er­ar­chy, it should come as no sur­prise that the Korean oppa has a huge ego that can­not be bruised.</p>
    <p>This comes back to be­ing treated like a lit­tle prince who can do no wrong. He was prob­a­bly praised his whole life too, no mat­ter what he did, and he will crave praise from you too.</p>
    <p>“Oppa jal­haesseoyo”, which means good job oppa, is go­ing to be your life­long tagline. But then, why not? In life – reel or real – gen­uinely ap­pre­ci­at­ing your sig­nif­i­cant other is the se­cret to mak­ing a re­la­tion­ship work.</p>
    <p>And in case you’re won­der­ing if the oppa’s fe­male coun­ter­part is fact or fic­tion, well, that is a topic for an­other let­ter, an­other day.</p>
