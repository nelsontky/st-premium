    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained stable at an av­er­age of one case per day in the past two weeks, said the Min­istry of Health. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained stable at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day for the past fort­night.</p>
    <p>Twelve new coro­n­avirus cases were con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,639.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded one com­mu­nity case who is a work per­mit holder, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>He is a 31-year-old Bangladesh­i who was con­firmed to be pos­i­tive on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>He was asymp­to­matic, but was iden­ti­fied as a con­tact of a pre­vi­ously con­firmed case and was tested dur­ing quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>There were also four im­ported cases, com­pris­ing three per­ma­nent res­i­dents who re­turned from In­dia and one work pass holder who re­turned from Iran.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases had been placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing seven new Covid-19 pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among them, four were iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases and had been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>They were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod, MOH said.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing three cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, like the ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries that is done ev­ery fort­night.</p>
    <p>No new clus­ters and no new lo­ca­tions vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained stable at an av­er­age of one case per day in the past two weeks, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained stable at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day for the past fort­night.</p>
    <p>With 29 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,276 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 36 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal while 285 are in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive died of other causes.</p>
