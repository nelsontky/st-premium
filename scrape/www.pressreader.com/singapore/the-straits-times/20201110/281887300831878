    <p>Q Will United States’ sanc­tions stunt the as­cent of Chi­nese sci­ence?</p>
    <p>A China has been fast as­cend­ing the world league ta­ble of sci­ence. Ac­cord­ing to the lat­est Na­ture In­dex, which is based on to­tal pub­li­ca­tions in 82 top sci­ence jour­nals, in­clud­ing Cell, Na­ture, and Sci­ence, China ranks sec­ond glob­ally, af­ter the US.</p>
    <p>The in­dex also shows that China has been nar­row­ing the gap with the US: With to­tal re­search out­put mea­sured by a frac­tional count of to­tal pub­li­ca­tions, which gives each co-au­thor an equal share of the ar­ti­cle she con­trib­utes to, Chi­nese sci­en­tists pro­duced 37 per cent as much as their Amer­i­can coun­ter­parts did in 2015; that ra­tio went up to 67 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>China’s rapid progress in ba­sic re­search clearly ben­e­fits from its en­gage­ment with US sci­ence. In the 2018-2019 school year, 171,000 Chi­nese stu­dents were en­rolled in sci­ence and en­gi­neer­ing pro­grammes at US universiti­es.</p>
    <p>My re­search shows that of the elite Chi­nese sci­en­tists, those who have pub­lished as se­nior au­thors in the three top sci­ence jour­nals of Cell, Na­ture, and Sci­ence in the past decade, 60 per cent ei­ther re­ceived their doc­toral or post-doc­toral train­ing in the US.</p>
    <p>And 70 per cent of th­ese pa­pers in­volved at least one US-based re­search col­lab­o­ra­tor last year.</p>
    <p>This is not sur­pris­ing since sci­ence is a cu­mu­la­tive process: To see fur­ther, you have to climb on the shoul­ders of gi­ants. And the</p>
    <p>US, be­ing the dom­i­nant sci­ence su­per­power, has plenty of gi­ants.</p>
    <p>Per­haps for the same rea­son, sci­ence has been in the crosshairs of the US sanc­tions against China. The US gov­ern­ment has taken le­gal ac­tion against prom­i­nent US sci­en­tists who have been re­cruited by the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment’s Thou­sand Tal­ents Pro­gramme to help boost China’s sci­en­tific re­search ca­pa­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>There has also been dis­cus­sion about im­pos­ing curbs on stu­dents and schol­ars want­ing to train in sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy in the US.</p>
    <p>How does this bode for the fu­ture of Chi­nese sci­ence? To an­swer this, we need to un­der­stand that sci­ence is also an open process, mak­ing it dif­fer­ent from tech­nol­ogy in­no­va­tion in commercial en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>DIF­FER­ENT SORTS OF EXCLUSIVIT­Y</p>
    <p>Both sci­en­tists and commercial in­ven­tors are re­warded by exclusivit­y. For sci­en­tists, the exclusivit­y comes from their be­ing the first to dis­cover a new law or mat­ter of na­ture; commercial in­ven­tors de­rive their exclusivit­y from be­ing the sole owner of a new tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists es­tab­lish exclusivit­y by fully dis­clos­ing their dis­cov­ery, in­clud­ing the process it takes to ar­rive at the find­ings. This en­ables their claim on exclusivit­y to be ver­i­fied and recog­nised by other sci­en­tists. Such peer af­fir­ma­tion is cru­cial for es­tab­lish­ing exclusivit­y, which is also a rep­u­ta­tion booster and the pri­mary source of pro­fes­sional pay­offs for sci­en­tists.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the most ef­fec­tive way for commercial in­no­va­tors to profit from their in­ven­tions is to keep them se­cret. But se­crecy is not al­ways fea­si­ble. The molec­u­lar struc­ture of a new chem­i­cal drug can be re­dis­cov­ered by oth­ers through re­verse en­gi­neer­ing, so that it is im­per­a­tive for the in­ven­tor of the drug to ap­ply for patents to guard against imi­ta­tion. Even then, the commercial in­no­va­tor will not dis­close more about the drug than what is legally re­quired of him to do.</p>
    <p>The quick and wide dif­fu­sion of new knowl­edge is in­trin­sic to sci­ence. The ri­valry among sci­en­tists of­ten pro­motes, rather than im­pedes, knowl­edge dif­fu­sion. Dr Fran­cis Crick and</p>
    <p>Dr James Wat­son are cred­ited with the dis­cov­ery of the dou­ble helix struc­ture of DNA. But it was Dr Ros­alind Franklin’s work on X-ray crys­tal­log­ra­phy that played an in­stru­men­tal role in the dis­cov­ery de­spite the fierce ri­valry among them.</p>
    <p>Nowa­days, much of this dif­fu­sion takes place on the In­ter­net. Nu­mer­ous on­line plat­forms al­low sci­en­tists to pub­lish their re­search be­fore it ap­pears in aca­demic jour­nals.</p>
    <p>And when it is pub­lished in those jour­nals, which usu­ally charge hefty sub­scrip­tion fees, it has be­come com­mon prac­tice for re­searchers to pay th­ese jour­nals to grant read­ers free ac­cess to their ar­ti­cles, pre­sum­ably to spread the in­flu­ence of their work.</p>
    <p>THE COVID-19 EX­AM­PLE</p>
    <p>Open sci­ence was on full display when the Covid-19 pan­demic gal­vanised the global sci­en­tific com­mu­nity in a joint and col­lab­o­ra­tive ef­fort to de­ci­pher the virus: the se­quenc­ing of its genome, clin­i­cal stud­ies of pa­tients with the virus, et cetera. In­for­ma­tion was shared in a timely and trans­par­ent way, cre­at­ing a global pub­lic good.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when it comes to vac­cine de­vel­op­ment, much re­mains in the dark be­cause enor­mous commercial and even geopo­lit­i­cal in­ter­ests are at stake.</p>
    <p>Th­ese sug­gest that the US sanc­tions against China in ba­sic sci­en­tific re­search may not be as ef­fec­tive as their ini­tia­tors had imag­ined, if the ob­jec­tive is to deny Chi­nese sci­en­tists ac­cess to cut­ting-edge re­search.</p>
    <p>And the sanc­tions have pro­duced an un­in­tended con­se­quence.</p>
    <p>FIX­ING THE WEAKER LINK</p>
    <p>Ba­sic sci­en­tific re­search has long been recog­nised as a weaker link in China’s in­creas­ingly so­phis­ti­cated tech­nol­ogy in­no­va­tion ma­chin­ery com­pared with ap­plied, en­gi­neer­ing-based re­search and in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>The geopo­lit­i­cal ri­valry with the US has ac­cen­tu­ated this vul­ner­a­bil­ity, to which China is re­spond­ing with sig­nif­i­cantly more in­vest­ment in sci­ence.</p>
    <p>China’s min­is­ter of sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy re­cently an­nounced that its ex­pen­di­ture on ba­sic re­search has dou­bled in the last five years.</p>
    <p>Also, the pres­i­dent of the Chi­nese Academy of Sciences promised to turn the US sanc­tion list, in­clud­ing lithog­ra­phy tech­nol­ogy and equip­ment, a ma­jor Western stran­gle­hold on China’s high-end semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­tur­ing, into a to-do-list for his in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear whether this is the best way to guide sci­ence. But to the ex­tent that China’s in­vest­ment in sci­ence con­trib­utes to the global pub­lic good, it should be wel­comed.</p>
