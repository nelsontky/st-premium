    <p>WASHINGTON • Judge Amy Coney Bar­rett flatly has re­fused to pledge that she would re­cuse her­self if a dis­pute over the Nov 3 election came be­fore the US Supreme Court, in­sist­ing that de­spite her nom­i­na­tion by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, she would not “al­low my­self to be used as a pawn to de­cide this election for the Amer­i­can peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a nearly 12-hour ques­tio­nand-an­swer ses­sion on Tues­day, Mrs Bar­rett evaded Demo­cratic sen­a­tors’ ef­forts to pin down her views on the Af­ford­able Care Act, abor­tion rights, gay mar­riage and a pos­si­ble election-re­lated case.</p>
    <p>She also played down her his­tory of tak­ing con­ser­va­tive stances in le­gal writ­ings and per­sonal state­ments, ar­gu­ing that she might view is­sues dif­fer­ently as a sit­ting jus­tice.</p>
    <p>“I have not made any com­mit­ments or deals,” she told the Se­nate Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee on the sec­ond day of her con­fir­ma­tion hear­ings. “I’m not here on a mis­sion to de­stroy the Af­ford­able Care Act. I’m just here to ap­ply the law and ad­here to the rule of law.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter days of ham­mer­ing Mrs Bar­rett over the health­care law, Democrats dis­missed her as­sur­ances as es­sen­tially mean­ing­less.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump did not need to se­cure any spe­cific prom­ises from Mrs Bar­rett, they ar­gued.</p>
    <p>He se­lected her pre­cisely be­cause</p>
    <p>her hon­estly held le­gal views would achieve the end he is af­ter.</p>
    <p>“I am then left with look­ing at the tracks of your record and where it leads the Amer­i­can peo­ple,” said Demo­cratic Se­na­tor Amy Klobuchar. “And I think it leads us to a place that’s go­ing to have se­vere reper­cus­sions for them.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Bar­rett’s re­fusal to dis­cuss spe­cific cases or com­mit to re­cus­ing from par­tic­u­lar mat­ters was in line with a decades-old play­book used by Supreme Court nominees to avoid giv­ing sub­stan­tive an­swers dur­ing con­fir­ma­tion hear­ings.</p>
    <p>But her at­tempts to de­flect such ques­tions were more con­spic­u­ous than usual, given how ex­plicit Mr Trump has been about how he would want his nominees to rule.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent has stated that he wants Mrs Bar­rett con­firmed by election day on Nov 3, given that he an­tic­i­pates an election dis­pute and is “count­ing” on the court to “look at the bal­lots”.</p>
    <p>And he has said he wants jus­tices who would “do the right thing” and in­val­i­date the Af­ford­able Care Act.</p>
    <p>“I am gravely con­cerned by what I see,” said Demo­cratic Se­na­tor</p>
    <p>Chris Coons. “I be­lieve your views are sin­cere, but I also think you gen­uinely think the Af­ford­able Care Act is un­con­sti­tu­tional.”</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg, whose seat Mrs Bar­rett would be tak­ing if con­firmed, he added that if Mr Trump and Repub­li­cans “are able to swing the court out of bal­ance by re­plac­ing Jus­tice Gins­burg by some­one whose views may be sig­nif­i­cantly to the right, the health of a ma­jor­ity of Amer­i­cans may well be in peril”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Repub­li­cans, rush­ing to se­cure Mrs Bar­rett’s con­fir­ma­tion be­fore the election, lav­ished praise on her for her le­gal qual­i­fi­ca­tions and per­sonal virtues.</p>
    <p>Se­na­tor Lind­sey Gra­ham of South Carolina, the ju­di­ciary com­mit­tee’s chair­man, de­scribed her as “one of the most qual­i­fied peo­ple of your gen­er­a­tion”, while Se­na­tor John Cornyn of Texas en­cour­aged her to hold up the blank notepad in front of her at the wit­ness ta­ble to show that she was speak­ing en­tirely with­out notes.</p>
    <p>The marathon day of tele­vised ques­tion­ing of­fered sen­a­tors and Amer­i­cans their first de­tailed look at Mrs Bar­rett’s con­ser­va­tive le­gal phi­los­o­phy, heav­ily in­flu­enced by former Jus­tice An­tonin Scalia, and a win­dow into her per­sonal life as a 48-year-old judge and mother of seven chil­dren.</p>
