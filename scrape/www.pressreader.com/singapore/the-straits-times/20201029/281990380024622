    <p>Vis­i­tors to the re­vamped Sin­ga­pore Dis­cov­ery Cen­tre (SDC) can now role-play as spe­cial agents in­ves­ti­gat­ing the fate of sol­diers sent on a top-se­cret mil­i­tary mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Work­ing in teams of two to five, they need to piece to­gether clues to solve puz­zles be­fore they can “es­cape” from one room to the next in what is called the Black Lake Fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>In all, there are 13 such rooms, with three to four rooms tak­ing about an hour per play-through.</p>
    <p>Another new fea­ture at the SDC, which is in Jurong West, is a laser tag arena, where play­ers can fire laser guns at one another.</p>
    <p>These are among the new fa­cil­i­ties that will be un­veiled on Saturday when the cen­tre re­opens af­ter six months of ren­o­va­tion, SDC said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But the cen­tre will open other fa­cil­i­ties pro­gres­sively, partly to en­sure that crowd con­trol and other Covid-19 safety mea­sures are im­ple­mented prop­erly, SDC ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Joseph Tan said.</p>
    <p>Other fa­cil­i­ties that will be open on Saturday in­clude a multi-sen­sory theatre, a new cafe and a board­walk on the lake be­side SDC where vis­i­tors can see up close some of the more than 2,300 newly in­stalled so­lar pan­els, which will help sup­ply nearly half of the cen­tre’s an­nual elec­tric­ity con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>At a preview of the new-look cen­tre yes­ter­day, re­porters were shown the SDC’s re­freshed per­ma­nent gallery, with large screens that pro­vide a more im­mer­sive view­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and a theatre mod­elled af­ter a bunker.</p>
    <p>The gallery tells the Sin­ga­pore story from the 14th cen­tury till the present day, high­light­ing key events such as the Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion, the In­done­sian Kon­frontasi and the 1983 cable car tragedy.</p>
    <p>Half of the gallery, which is still be­ing ren­o­vated, will open in the mid­dle of next month.</p>
    <p>The other half – which will fo­cus on more con­tem­po­rary is­sues – is sched­uled to be ready in the mid­dle of next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said that while the con­tent and the theme of the Sin­ga­pore story do not change very much, the way the story is told has changed, with the use of tech­nol­ogy – such as aug­mented re­al­ity – and pos­si­bly holo­grams in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>For that part of the gallery, which will be ready next year, an el­e­ment in­volv­ing Covid-19 will be in­cluded, he added.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 story is still evolv­ing, but by the mid­dle of next year, we would have been able to cu­rate enough in­ter­est­ing sto­ries,” he said.</p>
    <p>“So it’s not just strug­gles but also about cel­e­brat­ing what we’re good at. So when all these sto­ries are put to­gether, it’s about co-creat­ing a Sin­ga­pore story to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan added that vis­i­tors will be able to take part through group ac­tiv­i­ties and dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>To help keep Covid-19 at bay, the re­opened cen­tre will, for in­stance, al­low in a max­i­mum of 499 peo­ple at any one time.</p>
    <p>To en­sure there is no over­crowd­ing, vis­i­tors are en­cour­aged to make prior book­ings on­line for fa­cil­i­ties that re­quire en­try tick­ets, such as the es­cape and laser tag rooms, as well as the gallery.</p>
    <p>The laser tag arena, with ticket cost­ing ei­ther $12 or $15 per per­son, uses the He­lios2 laser tag sys­tem, and fea­tures three game­play themes – cy­borg, ex­trater­res­trial and post-apoc­a­lyp­tic. Play­ers can sign up solo or in teams of up to five peo­ple per time slot.</p>
    <p>The room in­cludes in­ter­ac­tive com­bat sim­u­la­tions – such as “land mines” – that will ac­ti­vate when a player walks on them.</p>
    <p>A new cafe called Wild Thyme re­places the for­mer can­teen. Board games are also avail­able in a part­ner­ship with The Mind Cafe.</p>
    <p>The Black Lake Fa­cil­ity costs $30 for those aged 13 and older, and $24 for chil­dren aged three to 12. The price is for one play-through of one of the four story chap­ters and it is es­ti­mated to take about an hour.</p>
    <p>Af­ter each play-through, the es­cape room will be closed for dis­in­fec­tion for 30 min­utes. Play­ers are also re­quired to wear dis­pos­able gloves, in ad­di­tion to masks.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic en­gage­ment ex­ec­u­tive Amanda Yin, a mem­ber of the team that de­signed the Black Lake Fa­cil­ity, said it is based on a fic­tional reimag­in­ing of the SDC as a place do­ing re­search on a relic lo­cated at the lake be­side it.</p>
    <p>“Each chap­ter tells a part of the sto­ry­line. This en­cour­ages mul­ti­ple play-throughs for the full story, as well as caters to dif­fer­ent lev­els of dif­fi­culty,” she added.</p>
