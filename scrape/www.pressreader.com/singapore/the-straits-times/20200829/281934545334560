    <p>• Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den and run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris launched a two-pronged at­tack on Thurs­day against Mr Don­ald Trump, say­ing the US Pres­i­dent is fu­elling un­rest over po­lice bru­tal­ity and racial injustice and has failed to pro­tect Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump “refuses to even ac­knowl­edge there is a racial jus­tice prob­lem in Amer­ica”, Mr Bi­den said in a state­ment amid swelling so­cial un­rest af­ter an African Amer­i­can man, Mr Ja­cob Blake, was shot in the back at close range mul­ti­ple times by po­lice in Wis­con­sin.</p>
    <p>The shoot­ing sparked na­tion­wide rage and three nights of vi­o­lence in the city of Kenosha. Ten­sions soared when two pro­test­ers were shot dead on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>A white 17-year-old was de­tained on mur­der charges con­nected to the pro­test­ers’ slay­ings, and Mr Trump an­nounced he was send­ing fed­eral forces to Kenosha to “re­store law and or­der”.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence warned peo­ple watch­ing the Repub­li­can con­ven­tion that they “won’t be safe in Joe Bi­den’s Amer­ica”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den shot back that the deadly vi­o­lence did not oc­cur on his watch, and will not dur­ing a fu­ture Bi­den pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>“The vi­o­lence we’re wit­ness­ing is hap­pen­ing un­der Don­ald Trump. Not me,” Mr Bi­den said, adding that Mr Trump – who has yet to pub­licly ad­dress Mr Blake’s shoot­ing – is turn­ing a blind eye to the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of look­ing to calm the wa­ters, he adds fuel to every fire. Vi­o­lence isn’t a prob­lem in his eyes – it’s a po­lit­i­cal strat­egy,” Mr Bi­den said. “And the more of it, the bet­ter for him.”</p>
    <p>With Mr Trump clos­ing out the Repub­li­can con­ven­tion with a speech on Thurs­day night, Ms Har­ris sought to shine a light on racial injustice and po­lice bru­tal­ity. “As (for­mer) vice-pres­i­dent Bi­den put it, the shots fired at Mr Blake pierced the soul of our na­tion,” she told re­porters in an ad­dress in Washington. “It’s sick­en­ing to watch. It’s all too fa­mil­iar. And it must end.”</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris said she would “al­ways de­fend” peace­ful pro­test­ers but they should not be con­fused “with those loot­ing and com­mit­ting acts of vi­o­lence”.</p>
    <p>She also warned against cit­i­zens tak­ing the law into their own hands, a veiled ref­er­ence to the ar­rested teen. “Make no mis­take, we will not let th­ese vig­i­lantes and ex­trem­ists de­rail the path to jus­tice,” Ms Har­ris said.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris also went af­ter Mr Trump for his han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, say­ing the Pres­i­dent showed “reck­less dis­re­gard” by fail­ing to take de­ci­sive ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent Trump got it wrong in the be­gin­ning. And then, he got it wrong again, and again. And the con­se­quences have been cat­a­strophic,” she said.</p>
