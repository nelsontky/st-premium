    <p>The 10 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion num­ber was al­ways a plan­ning pa­ram­e­ter and not a tar­get for Sin­ga­pore, said for­mer chief plan­ner Liu Thai Ker.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Chi­nese daily Lianhe Zaobao pub­lished yes­ter­day, Mr Liu said sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment re­quires long-term plan­ning.</p>
    <p>If Sin­ga­pore is to con­tinue to pre­serve the qual­ity of its land­scape de­spite space and re­source con­straints, he said, it must plan on the ba­sis of a large enough pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to claims dur­ing the elec­tion hus­tings by the Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party that the Gov­ern­ment plans to in­crease Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion to 10 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>At a di­a­logue with univer­sity stu­dents last year, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat cited Mr Liu, who had said that Sin­ga­pore should plan for 10 mil­lion peo­ple for it to re­main sus­tain­able in the long term.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng had cited Mr Liu in his re­sponse to a ques­tion on the Gov­ern­ment’s 2013 Pop­u­la­tion White Pa­per, which pro­jected that Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion would reach 6.5 mil­lion to 6.9 mil­lion by 2030.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he had stressed that the num­ber goes be­yond how densely pop­u­lated Sin­ga­pore would be, and that so­cial space is as im­por­tant. He also did not say Sin­ga­pore should plan for 10 mil­lion peo­ple – nor did he men­tion the fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng added that look­ing at to­day’s sit­u­a­tion, the pop­u­la­tion is likely to be sig­nif­i­cantly be­low 6.9 mil­lion by 2030.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu said he had not paid much at­ten­tion to the po­lit­i­cal de­bate over the is­sue, and his com­ments on Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion were “per­sonal opin­ions”. He stressed that the 10 mil­lion fig­ure is not a goal but the worst-case sce­nario.</p>
    <p>The 82-year-old is an ar­chi­tect and for­mer chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Hous­ing Board, as well as the for­mer chief plan­ner of the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (URA). He is cur­rently the found­ing chair­man of Mor­row Ar­chi­tects and Plan­ners.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his in­ter­view with Zaobao, he re­it­er­ated that he had no con­tact with the Gov­ern­ment or po­lit­i­cal lead­ers af­ter he left public ser­vice in 1992, and the 10 mil­lion fig­ure was a plan­ning bench­mark and his re­marks on the is­sue were his per­sonal opin­ion.</p>
    <p>The broader ob­jec­tive, he said, was al­ways to pre­serve the coun­try’s beau­ti­ful ur­ban en­vi­ron­ment, in­clud­ing its green spa­ces and his­toric mon­u­ments. “If you don’t make prepa­ra­tions now, when you need more ex­press­ways and MRT lines, where will the land come from?”</p>
    <p>He pointed out that when he led URA to de­velop the Con­cept Plan in 1991, he had thought that the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion would hit 5.5 mil­lion in 100 years – an es­ti­mate that came true 70 years ahead of time.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s cur­rent pop­u­la­tion is 5.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Liu said he be­lieves the pop­u­la­tion num­ber can­not be com­pletely con­trolled, as it is partly a func­tion of rapid eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>As long as the Gov­ern­ment is clean and ef­fec­tive and the econ­omy de­vel­ops well, the num­ber of jobs will in­crease. “Un­less Sin­ga­pore­ans are ask­ing the Gov­ern­ment to dam­age the econ­omy in or­der not to in­crease the pop­u­la­tion.”</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged con­cerns about an in­flux of im­mi­grants and whether the coun­try’s in­fra­struc­ture can cope with a large pop­u­la­tion. But, he pointed out that train ser­vices are an ad­min­is­tra­tive and man­age­ment is­sue and not re­lated to pop­u­la­tion num­bers.</p>
    <p>He urged Sin­ga­pore­ans to not just see the neg­a­tives, but also the pos­i­tive con­tri­bu­tions by for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>He said: “In any case, I don’t see a 10 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion com­ing to pass at my age... I am not wor­ried about my­self. I am wor­ried about the younger gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
