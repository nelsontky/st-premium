    <p>FIC­TION THE DIS­COM­FORT OF EVENING</p>
    <p>By Marieke Lu­cas Ri­jn­eveld, trans­lated by Michele Hutchi­son Faber & Faber/ Pa­per­back/</p>
    <p>282 pages/ $27.82/</p>
    <p>Avail­able at bit.ly/DoEven­ing_MLR</p>
    <p>Jas is 10 years old and she has de­cided to stop tak­ing off her coat. It is one of those strange, rit­u­al­is­tic con­vic­tions par­tic­u­lar to a child, as is Jas’ grow­ing con­cern that her par­ents mean to kill her pet rab­bit.</p>
    <p>Jeal­ous that her brother Matthies gets to go ice skat­ing when she does not, she prays to God to take him in­stead of her rab­bit. Matthies dies.</p>
    <p>The Dis­com­fort Of Evening, a Dutch best­seller which won this year’s Booker In­ter­na­tional Prize for fic­tion trans­lated into English, is an in­cred­i­bly dis­turb­ing book.</p>
    <p>“Dis­com­fort is good,” re­flects Jas. “In dis­com­fort we are real.”</p>
    <p>But “dis­com­fort” does not be­gin to cover what hap­pens to this farm­ing fam­ily as they un­spool from grief.</p>
    <p>Ri­jn­eveld, a non-bi­nary au­thor who at 29 is the prize’s youngest winner, works on a Dutch dairy farm in real life and also lost a brother at a young age.</p>
    <p>In this novel, the dairy farm and the ru­ral, de­voutly Chris­tian com­mu­nity in which Jas grows up are de­picted in un­spar­ing, squalid de­tail.</p>
    <p>Jas’ mother doses the chil­dren with worm medicine and rubs reek­ing ud­der oint­ment into their skin to pro­tect them from the cold. The fam­ily eat mouldy bread to save money.</p>
    <p>“I still get wor­ried some­times that mould will grow in­side me,” says Jas, “that one day my skin will turn blue and white, like the spiced buns Dad slices the mould off with a big knife be­fore serv­ing to us, and that in due course, I’ll only be good as chicken feed.”</p>
    <p>De­cay per­me­ates the book, as the fam­ily falls apart in the wake of</p>
    <p>Matthies’ death and things they do not un­der­stand grow in­side them.</p>
    <p>Jas con­tin­ues to keep her coat on, smoth­er­ing pu­berty’s changes to her body with an in­creas­ingly re­pul­sive outer layer. She de­vel­ops in­tense con­sti­pa­tion, bloat­ing like a plugged corpse.</p>
    <p>She is fix­ated on the scat­o­log­i­cal – the nar­ra­tive seems per­pet­u­ally en­crusted in ex­cre­ment in some form or an­other – even as she strains in vain for re­lease.</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther has bouts of rage and threat­ens to leave for good. Her mother en­ters a deep de­pres­sion and stops eat­ing.</p>
    <p>Her other brother Obbe be­gins to hurt, then kill, small an­i­mals. Her younger sis­ter Hanna be­gins ex­plor­ing sex­ual acts with lit­tle aware­ness of what they mean.</p>
    <p>These are com­pul­sive, vis­ceral acts that Jas and her sib­lings feel they “have to re­peat un­til we un­der­stand Matthies’ death, even though we don’t know how”.</p>
    <p>It is hard, in all hon­esty, to rec­om­mend that peo­ple read this book. There are stom­ach-churn­ing mo­ments – one in­volv­ing a cheese scoop, an­other an ar­ti­fi­cial in­sem­i­na­tion gun – that one would not want to in­flict on other read­ers. Ri­jn­eveld is ob­sessed with putting things where they just should not go.</p>
    <p>Yet in the midst of so much filth and cru­elty is Jas, with her be­wil­dered, po­etic thoughts about God, about love, about what to do with a grief so in­com­pre­hen­si­ble and un­speak­able that it tran­scends the lim­its of the body. Hutchi­son does deft work trans­lat­ing this darkly unique child’s voice.</p>
    <p>The Dis­com­fort Of Evening is not for ev­ery­one. But those who brave it will dis­cover some­thing un­usu­ally, painfully real.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Sour Heart by Jenny Zhang (Bloomsbury, 2018, $18.95, avail­able for or­der at bit.ly/ SourHrt_Zhang), a short-story col­lec­tion of mov­ing and at times grotesque tales nar­rated by the young daugh­ters of Chi­nese im­mi­grants to Amer­ica.</p>
