    <p>Af­ford­able, avail­able in many tasty flavours, and con­tain­ing as much hearthealt­hy omega-3 fatty acids as fresh fish (and some­times more), canned fish is ar­guably one of to­day’s most mis­un­der­stood pantry items.</p>
    <p>De­spite com­mon mis­con­cep­tions about them, this hum­ble pantry sta­ple can be a part of a healthy diet, says ac­cred­ited nu­tri­tion­ist Sher­min Low from MyKen­zen Nu­tri­tion Ser­vices. Canned foods do not re­quire preser­va­tives. The canning process it­self, which un­der­goes heat ster­il­i­sa­tion, al­ready pre­serves them in air­tight and vac­uum-sealed con­tain­ers.</p>
    <p>To help you de­ter­mine if a canned prod­uct con­tains preser­va­tives, take a closer look at the nu­tri­tion in­for­ma­tion panel which, by law, should re­flect all the in­gre­di­ents used. Listed in de­scend­ing or­der by weight, these should be few and un­pro­cessed or min­i­mally pro­cessed.</p>
    <p>As a good guide, look out for the Health­ier Choice Sym­bol as well, as it gen­er­ally in­di­cates that the prod­uct con­tains low amounts of sodium and su­gar. Based on a United States Depart­ment of Agri­cul­ture study that shows fresh and canned fish have com­pa­ra­ble amounts of omega-3 fatty acids (which help lower the risk of get­ting car­dio­vas­cu­lar disease), both canned and fresh fish are good sources of pro­tein and other im­por­tant nu­tri­ents, and one is not nec­es­sar­ily health­ier than the other.</p>
    <p>Omega-3 is prone to ox­i­da­tion but the canning process helps to seal it — along with other vi­ta­mins — till con­sump­tion. Fatty fish such as mack­erel, sar­dines and tuna are also not widely avail­able in wet mar­kets, so their canned ver­sions are con­ve­nient al­ter­na­tives. Apart from omega-3, nu­tri­ents like pro­tein, vi­ta­min D, B vi­ta­mins, se­le­nium and iron are present in fish. We are only get­ting a sin­gle type of nu­tri­ent from fish oil sup­ple­ments and miss­ing out on oth­ers.</p>
    <p>To put it into per­spec­tive, one 160g can of saba flakes has 8.5 times more omega-3 than one cap­sule of fish oil*. Two serv­ings of fish per week are enough to meet your omega-3 needs.</p>
