    <p>Ad­di­tional tem­po­rary re­lief mea­sures were un­veiled yes­ter­day for prop­erty de­vel­op­ers af­fected by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They in­volve ex­tend­ing var­i­ous project com­ple­tion dead­lines by a fur­ther six months to give con­struc­tion firms more time to com­plete res­i­den­tial, com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial de­vel­op­ments, given the de­lays caused by in­dus­try lock­downs and staff quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The ex­tended dead­lines come on top of the six­month ex­ten­sion an­nounced on May 6.</p>
    <p>An­other re­lief mea­sure an­nounced yes­ter­day ex­tends the com­mence­ment and com­ple­tion of res­i­den­tial projects in re­la­tion to the re­mis­sion of the ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty (ABSD) by a fur­ther six months, mak­ing the to­tal ex­ten­sion 12 months.</p>
    <p>An ad­di­tional ex­ten­sion of up to six months will also be granted for res­i­den­tial projects un­der the qual­i­fy­ing cer­tifi­cate (QC) regime for for­eign hous­ing de­vel­op­ers. This brings the to­tal ex­ten­sion to up to 12 months.</p>
    <p>The Min­istries of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment, Fi­nance, Law, and Trade and In­dus­try noted in a joint state­ment that de­vel­op­ers have raised con­cerns re­gard­ing the ad­di­tional costs and fi­nan­cial penalties that may be in­curred be­cause of de­lays due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, while al­most all con­struc­tion projects have re­sumed work, the full re­sump­tion of on-site oper­a­tions has re­mained a chal­lenge with work­ers be­ing placed un­der quar­an­tine if they have come in close con­tact with a Covid-19 case, the min­istries said.</p>
    <p>They also noted that work­site prac­tices that re­quire re­design for safe dis­tanc­ing have af­fected con­struc­tion time­lines.</p>
    <p>“With these ad­di­tional sup­port mea­sures, the Gov­ern­ment ex­pects de­vel­op­ers to con­tinue to sim­i­larly pro­vide re­lief and sup­port to their main con­trac­tors,” said the min­istries.</p>
    <p>They added that ad­di­tional re­lief mea­sures will be im­ple­mented as nec­es­sary so that “no stake­holder bears an un­due share of the bur­den im­posed by the Covid-19 pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>Qual­i­fy­ing con­di­tions for the new ex­ten­sions re­main the same as those an­nounced on May 6, when tem­po­rary re­lief mea­sures were ini­ti­ated.</p>
    <p>Land for res­i­den­tial projects must have been bought on or be­fore June 1, or the land was di­rectly alien­ated or had its lease re­newed by the Sin­ga­pore Land Author­ity on or be­fore June 1. In ad­di­tion, the orig­i­nal timeline for com­ple­tion of the de­vel­op­ment would have ex­pired on or af­ter Feb 1.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar con­di­tions also ap­ply to the com­mence­ment and com­ple­tion of res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ments un­der the ABSD regime.</p>
    <p>The ad­di­tional ex­ten­sion now means el­i­gi­ble res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ers have three years to start build­ing a project in­stead of two years with­out the re­lief mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Li­censed de­vel­op­ers will have six years to com­plete and sell units in projects in re­la­tion to the re­mis­sion of ABSD, in­stead of the usual five years.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there will be no fur­ther ex­ten­sion of the spec­i­fied timeline to sell all units in the res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>No ap­pli­ca­tions for the ex­ten­sion are nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Land for com­mer­cial and in­dus­trial projects must have been awarded on or be­fore June 1 this year or the land was di­rectly alien­ated or had its lease re­newed by the Sin­ga­pore Land Author­ity on or be­fore June 1. The orig­i­nal timeline for com­ple­tion of the project must also have ex­pired on or af­ter Feb 1 this year.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble de­vel­op­ers will be no­ti­fied, and no ap­pli­ca­tions are nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The project com­ple­tion pe­riod for for­eign hous­ing de­vel­op­ers, which is now five years, will be ex­tended by up to an ad­di­tional six months on ap­pli­ca­tion for el­i­gi­ble res­i­den­tial projects un­der the QC regime, on top of an ex­ten­sion of up to six months an­nounced in May.</p>
    <p>How­ever, no fur­ther waiver of ex­ten­sion charges to ex­tend the ex­ist­ing dead­line to dis­pose of all units in the res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ment project will be granted.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers who have al­ready ap­plied for an ex­ten­sion of com­ple­tion dead­lines un­der the mea­sures an­nounced on May 6 will au­to­mat­i­cally be granted a six­month waiver of ex­ten­sion charges.</p>
    <p>The ad­di­tional ex­ten­sion now means el­i­gi­ble res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ers have three years to start build­ing a project in­stead of two years with­out the re­lief mea­sures. Li­censed de­vel­op­ers will have six years to com­plete and sell units in projects in re­la­tion to the re­mis­sion of ABSD, in­stead of the usual five years. How­ever, there will be no fur­ther ex­ten­sion of the spec­i­fied timeline to sell all units in the res­i­den­tial de­vel­op­ment.</p>
