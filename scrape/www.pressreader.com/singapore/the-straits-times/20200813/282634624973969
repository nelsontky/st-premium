    <p>The movie The Hunt made the news when United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump slammed it in a tweet last Au­gust– be­fore he or any­one else had seen it.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the hor­ror thriller has a rather in­flam­ma­tory premise: A group of well-heeled Amer­i­can lib­er­als kid­nap some con­ser­va­tives and Trump sup­port­ers, so they can hunt and kill them for sport.</p>
    <p>On hear­ing the plot of the film – which stars Os­car win­ner Hi­lary Swank (Mil­lion Dol­lar Baby, 2004) and Betty Gilpin (Glow, 2017 to now) and opens in Sin­ga­pore to­day – Mr Trump tweeted that “the movie com­ing out is made in or­der to in­flame and cause chaos”.</p>
    <p>But the film is in fact a dark satir­i­cal com­edy that makes fun of stereo­types on both the left and the right sides of the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum in the US, says pro­ducer and writer Da­mon Lin­de­lof, cre­ator of hit tele­vi­sion shows such as Lost (2004 to 2010) and Watch­men (2019).</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a screen­ing of the film in Hol­ly­wood with co-writer Nick Cuse, the 47-year-old says: “We did have a lot of fun writ­ing and mak­ing the movie, and the idea that it was a satire, and so over the top and ridicu­lous and ab­surd, was al­ways top of mind.</p>
    <p>“And now that peo­ple are get­ting the op­por­tu­nity to see the movie, the only neg­a­tive feed­back we’re hear­ing is peo­ple are a lit­tle dis­ap­pointed that it’s not more con­tro­ver­sial.</p>
    <p>The film-maker, who won an Emmy in 2005 for pro­duc­ing Lost, adds: “But for a movie with such a high death toll, it’s kind of harm­less.”</p>
    <p>Lin­de­lof in­sists that the story is not anti-Trump or anti-con­serva</p>
    <p>We wanted the movie to be as fair and bal­anced as pos­si­ble. The last thing we wanted to do was make ‘a mes­sage movie’ or wag our fin­gers or have peo­ple say, ‘What do you think the moral of that movie was?’</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>DA­MON LIN­DE­LOF, pro­ducer and writer of The Hunt</p>
    <p>tive, but in­stead try­ing to high­light the ex­tremes on both sides of the po­lit­i­cal di­vide.</p>
    <p>“We wanted the movie to be as fair and bal­anced as pos­si­ble. The last thing we wanted to do was make ‘a mes­sage movie’ or wag our fin­gers or have peo­ple say, ‘What do you think the moral of that movie was?’”</p>
    <p>In fact, Lin­de­lof – who has cowrit­ten science-fic­tion films such as Star Trek Into Dark­ness (2013) and World War Z (2013) – found it eas­ier to make fun of those who are po­lit­i­cally lib­eral like him­self.</p>
    <p>“Fun­da­men­tally, we live in this bub­ble. If there’s one thing about this idea that we’re all on dif­fer­ent sides, I iden­tify as a (mem­ber of the) ‘coastal elite’, so it’s much eas­ier for me to make fun of my­self and the peo­ple I spend time with than the peo­ple I don’t.</p>
    <p>“And I have heard from some of my friends who’ve seen the movie, ‘You went a lit­tle bit hard on us.’ That made me feel like we prob­a­bly got it right then.”</p>
    <p>Lin­de­lof and Cuse, who col­lab­o­rated on the ac­claimed ex­is­ten­tial drama The Left­overs (2014 to 2017), also found it lib­er­at­ing writ­ing a screen­play where they could kill char­ac­ters with­out ag­o­nis­ing over it.</p>
    <p>“On TV, when we kill off a char­ac­ter, it’s this in­cred­i­bly de­lib­er­ate process – there are all these con­se­quences, you have to talk about what the stakes are and, in the next episode, ev­ery­body is mourn­ing them,” Lin­de­lof says.</p>
    <p>“And we thought, ‘Wouldn’t it be fun to make a movie where we’re just killing peo­ple the en­tire time and we don’t have to do any of that?’”</p>
    <p>But, the film-maker adds, hor­ror movies are ac­tu­ally harder to write than one might as­sume be­cause they are of­ten a tricky balanc­ing act that in­cor­po­rates com­edy, thriller and ac­tion el­e­ments too.</p>
    <p>“These movies and the other genre movies I grew up on, they are not easy to do. It did take a long time for Nick and I to fig­ure out this movie, and you re­alise when you’re try­ing to re­verse-en­gi­neer some­thing like this how tricky it is to get it right.”</p>
