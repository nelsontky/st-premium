    <p>A typhoon tore through the eastern coast of the Korean penin­sula yes­ter­day af­ter leav­ing neigh­bour­ing Japan, where it had left at least 108 peo­ple in­jured and forced mil­lions to evac­u­ate to safer ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Pack­ing winds of 150kmh, Typhoon Haishen made land­fall in the south­ern Korean port city of Ul­san in the morn­ing, bring­ing up to 70mm of rain­fall per hour.</p>
    <p>It left a trail of de­struc­tion, in­clud­ing at least 46 dam­aged struc­tures, power out­ages in about 70,000 house­holds in North and South Gyeongsang prov­inces, and numer­ous road clo­sures due to flood­ing.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal re­ports said about 1,640 peo­ple had to be evac­u­ated and at least five peo­ple were in­jured.</p>
    <p>One man in his 60s was struck on the head by a fly­away sign­board, while a woman in her 50s fell due to strong winds and hurt her head. Both were sent to hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Nearly 300 flights were grounded na­tion­wide, said Korea Air­ports Corp.</p>
    <p>Elec­tric­ity was also knocked out in the Ul­san fac­to­ries of South Korea’s largest car­maker Hyundai.</p>
    <p>Haishen, the 10th typhoon of the sea­son, was ex­pected to sweep up­wards to­wards North Korea last night and then dis­si­pate.</p>
    <p>Chair­ing an emer­gency meet­ing yes­ter­day, South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in or­dered the gov­ern­ment to carry out re­cov­ery work swiftly. He ex­pressed con­cern over the ex­tent of dam­age in some ar­eas, which were al­ready bat­tered by Typhoon Maysak just days ago. He also told of­fi­cials to re­main alert.</p>
    <p>In North Korea, state me­dia re­ported that streets were al­ready flooded and tele­phone ca­bles cut yes­ter­day be­fore Haishen hit.</p>
    <p>A typhoon warn­ing was is­sued as up to 400mm of rain was ex­pected in some re­gions, and res­i­dents liv­ing near the eastern shore in Tong­chon county were evac­u­ated.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Japan has been pick­ing up the pieces af­ter Haishen brought the south-west­ern is­land of Kyushu to a stand­still, with as many as 8.8 mil­lion peo­ple urged to seek safety.</p>
    <p>One per­son was con­firmed dead as of last night, and at least 108 in­jured. An­other four are miss­ing, in­clud­ing two Viet­namese in­terns at a con­struc­tion site af­ter their of­fice and neigh­bour­ing res­i­dence were washed away in a land­slide in Shi­iba vil­lage, in Miyazaki.</p>
    <p>The storm en­gulfed al­most all of Kyushu, about 50 times the size of Sin­ga­pore, and packed winds as strong as 216kmh.</p>
    <p>It forced the can­cel­la­tion of nearly 600 do­mes­tic flights, and grounded train services across south-west­ern Japan.</p>
    <p>In a rare move, the Japan Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Agency is­sued warn­ings more than three days in ad­vance, say­ing, among other things, that the storm had the po­ten­tial to “turn fly­ing um­brel­las into lethal weapons”.</p>
    <p>Ho­tels were booked out across Kyushu as peo­ple sought safety, with en­try lim­its at evac­u­a­tion cen­tres to en­sure so­cial dis­tanc­ing amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I had to hurry be­cause I was told that this evac­u­a­tion cen­tre would ac­cept only 10 more peo­ple,” Ms Kazuko Ha­mada, 67, told Kyodo News at a shel­ter near Ku­mamoto Sta­tion. She had gone to an­other evac­u­a­tion fa­cil­ity ini­tially but was turned away.</p>
    <p>About 200,000 homes were still with­out power as at last night.</p>
    <p>While un­prece­dented waves de­stroyed roads in coastal Kagoshima and record winds ripped the roof of a carpark in Na­gasaki’s Sasebo city, early as­sess­ments showed that the dam­age was much less than feared.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Vanessa Cheong, 33, who lives in Na­gasaki City, told The Straits Times that she pre­pared for the typhoon by tap­ing her win­dows, fill­ing her bath­tub with wa­ter, and stock­ing up with a few days’ worth of gro­ceries.</p>
    <p>“I was very wor­ried that my win­dows would break. It was very loud and my doors were rat­tling,” she said, adding that she was re­lieved that her home, as well as much of her city, emerged from the typhoon un­scathed.</p>
