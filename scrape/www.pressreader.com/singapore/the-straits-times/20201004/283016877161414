    <p>It seems like an easy job that you can do at home.</p>
    <p>Be paid up to a few hun­dred dol­lars each time for the seem­ingly easy task of re­ceiv­ing parcels or money and then re­dis­tribut­ing them to other peo­ple on a list given to you.</p>
    <p>Be­fore you say “yes” to such jobs, be mind­ful that the peo­ple who may show up at your door next could be the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Some in­ter­na­tional crime syn­di­cates have ap­par­ently started to re­cruit stay-at-home folks dur­ing the pan­demic to help them laun­der their ill-got­ten gains by be­com­ing their money mules.</p>
    <p>A spate of such cases has sur­faced in the United States.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Alabama res­i­dent Denise New­ton was in­vited by a com­pany named Heies to ap­ply for a job as a “lo­cal hub in­spec­tor”.</p>
    <p>She then started to re­ceive boxes with Ap­ple Watches and lap­tops in them. Her job was to open the boxes, check the con­tents and then mail them off to for­eign ad­dresses.</p>
    <p>But some­thing was off. The boxes were sus­pi­ciously plain, even though they in­cluded brand-name prod­ucts. When she asked ques­tions, her new em­ployer stopped re­spond­ing. In June, she re­ported Heies to the Bet­ter Busi­ness Bureau.</p>
    <p>It turned out that she had be­come what is known in se­cu­rity cir­cles as a money mule, an ac­com­plice who, ei­ther know­ingly or un­know­ingly, helps in­ter­na­tional crim­i­nal rings move their ill-got­ten gains.</p>
    <p>In her case, swindlers ap­peared to be buy­ing prod­ucts in the US with stolen money and then mail­ing them – us­ing un­wit­ting in­ter­me­di­aries like her to dis­guise their in­volve­ment – to overseas lo­ca­tions where the goods could be resold for cash.</p>
    <p>“They re­ally caught me at the per­fect time. I was just one of those des­per­ate peo­ple look­ing for a job,” Ms New­ton, 24, said.</p>
    <p>Since the pan­demic’s on­set in March, the num­ber of crim­i­nal schemes re­ly­ing on money mules has spiked. In to­tal, on­line hu­man re­source schemes where crim­i­nals pose as po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers have soared 295 per cent from a year ago, while schemes used for money laun­der­ing have sky­rock­eted by 609 per cent, ac­cord­ing to se­cu­rity firm ZeroFox.</p>
    <p>Many peo­ple who per­pe­trate these frauds are based overseas, the au­thor­i­ties said, so they need to move the money to their home coun­try. Banks and the au­thor­i­ties have made it harder to laun­der money through tra­di­tional fi­nan­cial chan­nels in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>So these crim­i­nals are now in­creas­ingly on the hunt for a larger sup­ply of po­ten­tial money mules just as many newly un­em­ployed peo­ple look for work.</p>
    <p>Money mules are not new, and their num­bers have risen along­side on­line fraud more broadly over the last two decades. Some peo­ple en­ter the busi­ness know­ing it is il­le­gal.</p>
    <p>Ad­ver­tise­ments look­ing for money mules on the so-called dark­net, an anony­mous cor­ner of the In­ter­net pop­u­lar with crim­i­nals, of­ten ac­knowl­edge the il­le­gal as­pect of the work.</p>
    <p>Yet seven peo­ple who be­came money mules dur­ing the pan­demic told The New York Times that they had no inkling of what their so­called em­ployer was up to when they be­gan the work. Many had re­cently lost their jobs and needed to pay the bills.</p>
    <p>To avoid ex­po­sure to the coro­n­avirus, they were also look­ing for jobs to do from home, just what many swindlers want from a money mule.</p>
    <p>Ms Alma Sar­das, 21, had been fur­loughed from her job at a ho­tel in Fort Worth, Texas, this spring, when she saw a listing on jobs web­site ZipRe­cruiter ad­ver­tis­ing a work-from-home po­si­tion as a “vir­tual as­sis­tant” to a busi­ness­man in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>She sat through a for­mal in­ter­view and spoke with a man who called him­self Her­mann Ziegler, who said he would be her boss.</p>
    <p>Once she was hired, she was sent a cheque for US$4,590 (S$6,260) to de­posit into her bank ac­count. She was told to use some of the money for her ex­penses and to send the rest from her ac­count to her new em­ployer’s ven­dors.</p>
    <p>She be­came scep­ti­cal about why the money would need to go through her bank ac­count and called the lo­cal po­lice. They ex­plained that she had al­most been caught in a clas­sic money-laun­der­ing scheme.</p>
    <p>The schemes us­ing money mules are var­ied. Some peo­ple who be­come mules are vic­tims of on­line ro­mance frauds who make bank and wire trans­fers for peo­ple they be­lieve care about them.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, like Ms Sar­das, are asked to use their own bank ac­counts to make fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions on be­half of their new em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms New­ton be­came em­broiled in what is known as a re-ship­ping scheme, where the fraud­sters buy goods with their stolen money and then use mules to get the prod­ucts overseas, where they can be resold.</p>
    <p>Apart from Ap­ple Watches and lap­tops, Ms New­ton said she was also sent odd items, in­clud­ing a pack of sponges and a garbage dis­posal.</p>
    <p>By the time she re­ported Heies to the Bet­ter Busi­ness Bureau, the num­bers and e-mails that the com­pany had used were dead. Its web­site had also been taken down. The per­pe­tra­tors, who have faced other on­line com­plaints, have not been caught.</p>
    <p>Since the pan­demic’s on­set in March, the num­ber of crim­i­nal schemes re­ly­ing on money mules has spiked. In to­tal, on­line hu­man re­source schemes where crim­i­nals pose as po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers have soared 295 per cent from a year ago, while schemes used for money laun­der­ing have sky­rock­eted by 609 per cent, ac­cord­ing to se­cu­rity firm ZeroFox.</p>
