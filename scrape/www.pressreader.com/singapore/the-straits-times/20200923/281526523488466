    <p>Three food and bev­er­age out­lets – in­clud­ing one in a cof­fee shop – have been or­dered to close for 10 days, while four oth­ers have been fined $1,000 each for flout­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures, said the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment (MSE) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows en­force­ment ac­tion taken against 18 other F&B out­lets, with three or­dered to close and 15 fined, as an­nounced last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Since the start of phase two, 45 F&B out­lets have been taken to task for breaches. Of these, 26 were or­dered to close and 19 were fined.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, MSE re­it­er­ated that gath­er­ings of groups of more than five peo­ple are not al­lowed, even if split across mul­ti­ple ta­bles. F&B op­er­a­tors are not per­mit­ted to ac­cept such reser­va­tions, it said.</p>
    <p>“Ex­cep­tions can only be made if all mem­bers of the group are from the same house­hold. In such cases, the group will need to be seated at mul­ti­ple ta­bles, with no more than five per­sons per ta­ble, with at least 1m spac­ing be­tween the ta­bles.</p>
    <p>“Es­tab­lish­ments can re­quest to ver­ify din­ers’ claims that they are from the same house­hold, and can re­ject en­try of din­ers at their dis­cre­tion,” it added.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu said the au­thor­i­ties will con­tinue to step up en­force­ment against vi­o­la­tions of safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“As Sin­ga­pore works to­wards re­open­ing our econ­omy, we must do so in a re­spon­si­ble and safe man­ner. This is to guard against a resur­gence in com­mu­nity cases, and po­ten­tial dev­as­tat­ing con­se­quences,” she wrote. “More peo­ple are din­ing out, espe­cially on week­ends, which is un­der­stand­able. But it is crit­i­cal for all of us to ad­here to safe man­age­ment mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>One of those or­dered to shut is a drinks out­let in a cof­fee shop at Block 261 Seran­goon Cen­tral Drive. Of­fi­cers ar­rived there at 10.55pm on Satur­day and saw cus­tomers con­sum­ing al­co­hol at two ta­bles.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act 2020, sell­ing and con­sum­ing al­co­holic bev­er­ages af­ter 10.30pm is pro­hib­ited. On Mon­day, the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency or­dered the out­let to close start­ing yes­ter­day un­til Oct 1 – a pe­riod of 10 days.</p>
    <p>Beer Fac­tory at 25 Church Street was or­dered to shut its doors by the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Author­ity last Thurs­day. It will stay closed for 10 days un­til Sun­day. On Sept 12, three groups of more than five cus­tomers each were ob­served at the out­let at 9.50pm.</p>
    <p>A restau­rant at 39 Hong Kong Street was also told to close af­ter of­fi­cers saw a group of 15 din­ers min­gling across four ta­bles at a pri­vate din­ner event on Sept 12. It will stay closed for 10 days un­til Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Four other out­lets were fined $1,000 for breaches such as al­low­ing groups of more than five to be seated to­gether or to in­ter­min­gle be­tween ta­bles, and seat­ing groups of cus­tomers less than 1m apart.</p>
