    <p>FIRM STANCE NEEDED</p>
    <p>The car­toon­ists of French satir­i­cal magazine Char­lie Hebdo would have been told to stop pub­lish­ing their works had they been in Sin­ga­pore, and if they had con­tin­ued, they would have been ar­rested, Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He made the point when em­pha­sis­ing that Sin­ga­pore does not al­low any religious group to be in­sulted or at­tacked.</p>
    <p>“The Char­lie Hebdo car­toon­ists, if they were here, they would have been told to stop. If they didn’t stop, ISD (In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity De­part­ment) would visit them and they would have been ar­rested.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that we can build a multi-religious, mul­tira­cial so­ci­ety based on trust, and only by tak­ing a firm stance against hate speech and deal­ing with all com­mu­ni­ties equally and fairly,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam, who is also Law Min­is­ter, was speak­ing at a sem­i­nar of the Religious Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion Group, held at Khadi­jah Mosque in Gey­lang.</p>
    <p>He said that in France, sec­u­lar­ism means the gov­ern­ment will not in­ter­vene in religious mat­ters or stop pub­li­ca­tions that at­tack re­li­gions. Free­dom of speech in France is “quite ab­so­lute”, to the ex­tent that it even in­cludes the right to blas­pheme, he added.</p>
    <p>But this did not hap­pen overnight, said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He re­counted how the Church was ex­tremely pow­er­ful in the Mid­dle Ages, but the bal­ance shifted over the cen­turies. The prin­ci­ples of sepa­ra­tion of state and re­li­gion and sec­u­lar­ity of the state grad­u­ally de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>At the same time, France faced greater im­mi­gra­tion post-World War II. But the French gov­ern­ment did not en­gage in any ac­tive ef­forts to in­te­grate the new im­mi­grants, nor did it look at whether its ap­proach needed to be re­con­sid­ered in the light of the chang­ing de­mo­graph­ics of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The re­sult, when the state takes a hands-off ap­proach, is that pub­li­ca­tions like Char­lie Hebdo can pub­lish “re­pul­sive, highly of­fen­sive” car­toons and ar­ti­cles on re­li­gions in the name of free speech, he said, adding that this was some­thing he could not ac­cept.</p>
    <p>France will have to find a way to bridge the gulf be­tween its prin­ci­ples of sec­u­lar­ism and free­dom, and the ex­pec­ta­tions and be­liefs of its peo­ple who do not ac­cept that their re­li­gions should be of­fen­sively car­i­ca­tured, he said.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged the de­bates in Sin­ga­pore that ask why the Gov­ern­ment is not al­low­ing free speech and be­ing de­fen­sive on is­sues of race and re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause if we take a hands-off ap­proach, then peo­ple will say since the Gov­ern­ment won’t do some­thing, I will do some­thing, and peo­ple are go­ing to be up­set with each other. The na­tional har­mony will be af­fected, and the ma­jor­ity of peo­ple will be af­fected.” Lim Min Zhang</p>
    <p>We be­lieve that we can build a multi-religious, mul­tira­cial so­ci­ety based on trust, and only by tak­ing a firm stance against hate speech and deal­ing with all com­mu­ni­ties equally and fairly.</p>
