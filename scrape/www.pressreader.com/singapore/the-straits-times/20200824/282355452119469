    <p>Ten years on and more than 15,000km from the site of the in­au­gu­ral Youth Olympic Games (YOG), Rainer Ng’s sil­ver-win­ning feat is now a handy ice breaker in Chicago, where the former na­tional swim­mer is based.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that some of his pals were un­fa­mil­iar with his ex­ploits in the pool, he told The Straits Times with a chuckle: “When I go to the pool or lake with my friends, they say, ‘You’re ac­tu­ally a re­ally good swim­mer’, and I can tell them I won sil­ver at the YOG.</p>
    <p>“I have a group of close friends here and when they in­tro­duce me to some­one new, they al­ways say, ‘This is Rainer, he won a sil­ver at the</p>
    <p>CHAD LE CLOS, 28 (RSA)</p>
    <p>With a gold medal, af­ter hand­ing Michael Phelps a rare de­feat in the 200m but­ter­fly in 2012, and three sil­vers, his Olympic re­sume is just a bronze short of his YOG haul. The four-time world cham­pion also boasts seven Com­mon­wealth Games ti­tles.</p>
    <p>THI­AGO BRAZ, 26 (BRA)</p>
    <p>He cleared a per­sonal-best 5.05m en route to a sil­ver in Singapore. Six years later on home soil at the Rio Games, he set an Olympic record of 6.03m to claim the gold.</p>
    <p>Youth Olympic Games.’</p>
    <p>“It’s a bit paiseh (em­bar­rass­ing) be­cause it was 10 years ago... they’re teas­ing a lit­tle but they’re also proud of me.”</p>
    <p>Paiseh or not, clinch­ing Singapore’s first sil­ver medal of the YOG in 2010 at the Singapore Sports School pool is an achieve­ment that not only evokes happy mem­o­ries, but has also in­stilled a sense of be­lief that Ng has held onto till to­day.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old, sec­ond in the boys’ 50m back­stroke be­hind Chris­tian Homer of Trinidad and Tobago, said: “One of the main lessons (from the YOG) is to never un­der­es­ti­mate your­self. Go­ing into the Games, I wasn’t ex­pect­ing a medal</p>
    <p>MON­ICA PUIG, 26 (PUR)</p>
    <p>She might have suf­fered firstround de­feats in the girls’ sin­gles and dou­bles – with Sin­ga­porean part­ner Ste­fanie Tan – here, but at the Rio Games, she stunned An­gelique Ker­ber in the ten­nis fi­nal to be­come her coun­try’s first Olympic cham­pion.</p>
    <p>“I think it’s every player’s dream to at least par­tic­i­pate in some kind of Olympic Games,” she told the In­ter­na­tional Ten­nis Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Even though it was the ju­nior Olympics, it was so spe­cial to me and it made it a goal for me to hope­fully play in the real Olympics.” out of it but sur­prises can hap­pen and you may achieve things you never thought you could be­fore.</p>
    <p>“That’s some­thing I’ve taken with me and it’s given me the con­fi­dence to know that I can do things that seem im­pos­si­ble... at work, for ex</p>
    <p>CAROLINA MARIN, 27 (ESP)</p>
    <p>Like Puig, Marin (be­low) did not reach the podium in Singapore, los­ing in the girls’ sin­gles quar­ter-fi­nals. But she went on to scale bad­minton’s rank­ings sum­mit, stay­ing at No. 1 for a record 66 weeks. The three-time world cham­pion also won gold at the 2016 Olympics. am­ple, you can get through tough projects and rise to the chal­lenge and take it on no mat­ter how hard it is.”</p>
    <p>Win­ning sil­ver also opened other doors, as Ng noted his re­sult at the YOG boosted his swim­ming pro­file.</p>
    <p>JADE JONES, 27 (GBR)</p>
    <p>Since win­ning gold in Singapore, she is on course to be­com­ing the first taek­wondo ex­po­nent to win three Olympic ti­tles.</p>
    <p>“The Youth Olympics for me was one of the best com­pe­ti­tions of my life,” she told the Olympic Chan­nel Pod­cast. “I just re­mem­ber I loved the whole ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>This, he felt, was one of the fac­tors that helped him se­cure a swim­ming schol­ar­ship to Brigham Young Univer­sity in Utah, which he at­tended from 2013 to 2017.</p>
    <p>While rep­re­sent­ing the school in col­lege meets, he some­times bumped into his coun­ter­parts from the YOG.</p>
    <p>“The event in Singapore was at such a high level that these ath­letes are go­ing out and do­ing well at the Olympic or col­lege lev­els in the US,” he added. “Every now and then I’d go and com­pete at a ri­val school and find that some­one looks fa­mil­iar. We’d have a con­ver­sa­tion and re­alise we com­peted at the YOG in Singapore... it puts Singapore on the map again.”</p>
    <p>In col­lege, he once raced against Homer, who at­tended the Univer­sity of Florida. Ng quipped: “I lost again, but we talked about the mem­o­ries from back then and (won­dered) when I could beat him.</p>
    <p>“From that Games it­self, you meet a lot of peo­ple from all over the world and when you see them go on to achieve great­ness in the sport­ing world, you can say, ‘I used to com­pete with them’.”</p>
    <p>He swam his last com­pet­i­tive race in 2017 and the tech con­sul­tant ac­knowl­edged miss­ing the adrenaline of rac­ing.</p>
    <p>“That feel­ing is hard to come by now. In your day-to-day work when you fin­ish a project, you don’t feel as ec­static as you do when you hit the wall and look at the score­board,” he added.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing his ac­com­plish­ment at the YOG as a “big sur­prise”, Ng, who won medals at the SEA Games and com­peted in the Asian Games, said: “This is the one I’m proud­est of, and it be­ing back in Singapore made it that much more spe­cial.</p>
    <p>“(The YOG) was such a huge part of my life ... It’s slowly be­come a dis­tant mem­ory but it’s still a good mem­ory I can look back on and be happy about.”</p>
