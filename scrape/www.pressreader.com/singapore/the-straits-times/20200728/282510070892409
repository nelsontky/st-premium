    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese pop star Ayumi Ha­masaki (left) was orig­i­nally plan­ning to hold a con­cert tour from Fe­bru­ary to Au­gust this year to mark her 22nd year i n show busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Ha­masaki, 41, broke i nto the scene in April 1998 with her de­but sin­gle Poker Face.</p>
    <p>She kicked off her tour in Ja­pan’s Saitama pre­fec­ture on Feb 20, but it was sus­pended two days later due to the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers an­nounced i n May that the rest of the 36 concerts have been can­celled due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, fans who missed Ha­masaki’s concerts got to see her per­form, al­beit via an on­line con­cert.</p>
    <p>There was no au­di­ence at the con­cert, which is ti­tled Ayumi</p>
    <p>Ha­masaki Pre­mium Lim­ited Live A, but fans could pay to watch the live broad­casts on the Abema stream­ing web­site.</p>
    <p>Ha­masaki be­gan the con­cert with the song Mad World and per­formed 17 other songs, in­clud­ing What­ever, Last An­gel, End Roll, Sur­vivor and Blue Bird. She ended the con­cert with the song The Show Must Go On.</p>
    <p>Ha­masaki, who gave birth to a baby boy last Novem­ber, also per­formed her new song Ohia Tree at the con­cert.</p>
    <p>She re­leased the sur­prise sin­gle – her first in four years – on July 4. The song is ded­i­cated to her son and tells of be­ing a new par­ent and her over­whelm­ing love for her child.</p>
    <p>Ha­masaki did not dis­close who the father of her son is, but sev­eral me­dia out­lets spec­u­lated that he is her 21-year-old boyfriend, dancer Shun­pei Araki. He was one of the per­form­ers at her con­cert.</p>
