    <p>Aus­tralia is seek­ing to boost de­mand for its cot­ton from coun­tries such as Viet­nam as ten­sions with China threaten to leave Can­berra with large stock­piles, sources fa­mil­iar with the plan said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Chi­nese cot­ton mills were or­dered to stop buy­ing Aus­tralian cot­ton, threat­en­ing a trade worth about A$900 mil­lion (S$902 mil­lion) amid es­ca­lat­ing ten­sions be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian pro­duc­ers did not im­me­di­ately feel the im­pact, how­ever, as their coun­try had lit­tle stock to sell after a sus­tained drought led to record low pro­duc­tion of the crop.</p>
    <p>But fol­low­ing that, rain soaked Aus­tralia’s east coast, and the coun­try’s grow­ers are on course to pro­duce 506,000 tonnes of cot­ton – the high­est since 2018 – leav­ing ex­porters scram­bling to find al­ter­na­tive mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“China typ­i­cally takes 60 per cent of Aus­tralian ex­ports. We are work­ing to boost buy­ing from Viet­nam, Thai­land and other Asian coun­tries,” said a source fa­mil­iar with the plan, speak­ing anony­mously be­cause he is not au­tho­rised to talk to the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia will be­gin har­vest­ing its 2020/2021 crop next April, giv­ing ex­porters sev­eral months to line up new cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s re­la­tion­ship with China soured in 2018 when it be­came the first coun­try to ban Chi­nese tele­com com­pany Huawei from its 5G net­work.</p>
    <p>The re­la­tion­ship wors­ened this year when Aus­tralia called for an in­quiry into the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>As ties de­te­ri­o­rated, China im­posed tar­iffs on Aus­tralian bar­ley and slowed its im­ports of Aus­tralian beef and coal.</p>
    <p>China will also tem­po­rar­ily im­pose anti-sub­sidy fees on some Aus­tralian wine im­ports, start­ing to­day, ramp­ing up pres­sure on the in­dus­try.</p>
