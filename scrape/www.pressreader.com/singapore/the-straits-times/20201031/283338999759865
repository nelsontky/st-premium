    <p>SPLASH­ING GOOD TIME: Chi­nese model-ac­tress Angelababy took a break from act­ing re­cently, when she went wakesurf­ing and then to a wa­ter theme park.</p>
    <p>In a video posted on Weibo on Thurs­day, the 31-year-old hap­pily boarded a speed­boat be­fore she was seen wakesurf­ing, a wa­ter sport in which the rider trails be­hind a boat and rides on the boat’s wake.</p>
    <p>She was also seen prac­tis­ing a few times and fall­ing into the wa­ter be­fore she man­aged to get the hang of things.</p>
    <p>In a post-credit scene, she was seen do­ing a chal­leng­ing ride in a wa­ter theme park, in which she twisted and turned down a wa­ter slide on a gi­ant float be­fore splash­ing into the wa­ter.</p>
    <p>“I feel like I’m be­ing flushed down a toi­let bowl be­fore go­ing into the sewer,” she said dur­ing the ride.</p>
    <p>Angelababy, who has been slammed in the past for her poor act­ing skills, was re­cently praised by some fans for her role in the mys­tery drama A Mur­der­ous Af­fair In Hori­zon Tower, in which she played a cafe owner who might have com­mit­ted sui­cide or been killed by an uniden­ti­fied as­sailant.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress, who is mar­ried to Chi­nese ac­tor Huang Xiaom­ing, 42, and has a three-year-old son, is also a cast mem­ber of Chi­nese va­ri­ety show Keep Run­ning (2014 to present).</p>
