    <p>TOKYO • Fac­tions within the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) have dras­ti­cally lost in­flu­ence over the last two decades, as power has co­a­lesced in the hands of the party pres­i­dent and top brass.</p>
    <p>This has paved the way for the as­cent of Ja­panese Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga. If he pre­vails in the race to suc­ceed Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, who steps down this week, he will be the first LDP prime min­is­ter with­out any fac­tion af­fil­i­a­tion since the party was founded in 1955.</p>
    <p>Th­ese fac­tions, whose for­mal name in Ja­panese trans­lates as “re­search groups”, had been in­flu­en­tial dur­ing the un­in­ter­rupted reign of the LDP from 1955 to the early 1990s. The in­tra-party fac­tional com­pe­ti­tion, which gained wide­spread me­dia cov­er­age, also helped re­in­force the LDP’s dom­i­nance.</p>
    <p>Lower House elec­tions had, un­til re­forms im­ple­mented in the 1994 elec­tion, been con­tests for mul­ti­seat con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent LDP fac­tions had at that time fielded groups of can­di­dates against one an­other in the same multi-seat dis­trict. Fac­tion bosses also jos­tled against one an­other in the race to be­come prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>But this changed from 1994, when Ja­pan adopted a hy­brid elec­toral sys­tem com­bin­ing both the sin­gle-seat first-past-the-post sys­tem and the “party list” pro­por­tional rep­re­sen­ta­tion sys­tem. This meant that it was no longer in the LDP’s po­lit­i­cal in­ter­ests to field com­pet­ing can­di­dates of ri­val fac­tions for a sin­gle seat.</p>
    <p>The LDP pres­i­dent and his al­lies in­stead wield the power to de­cide who con­tests where, even if the LDP oc­ca­sion­ally sees more than one can­di­date com­pet­ing head-on if a renegade re­fuses to back down.</p>
    <p>ABE’S RES­UR­REC­TION</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s suc­cess­ful re-elec­tion as LDP chief in 2012, af­ter he abruptly re­signed due to health rea­sons in 2007, was in part due to the re­duced in­flu­ence of fac­tions.</p>
    <p>The 2012 LDP pres­i­den­tial elec­tion had five can­di­dates, though only two of them were fac­tion chiefs: Mr Nobuteru Ishi­hara, a for­mer LDP sec­re­tary-gen­eral who still leads his own fac­tion, and the late Mr Nobu­taka Machimura.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe, who be­longed to Mr Machimura’s fac­tion, broke ranks against his own fac­tion chief, and won. He was helped by al­lies like Mr Taro Aso, who has his own fac­tion and is now Deputy Prime Min­is­ter, and Mr Suga, who was then the chair­man of the LDP cam­paign head­quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe still be­longs to the same fac­tion, which is now led by for­mer LDP sec­re­tary-gen­eral Hiroyuki Hosoda, and is now loosely known as the Hosoda fac­tion.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Cabi­net min­is­ters has his­tor­i­cally trended closely with the fac­tional strength in the Diet, as Ja­pan’s par­lia­men­tary body is known.</p>
    <p>This was also the case in Mr Abe’s Cabi­net since he came to power in De­cem­ber 2012, with some give and take, noted Dr Michael Bo­sack, spe­cial ad­viser for gov­ern­ment re­la­tions at the Yoko­suka Coun­cil on Asia-Pa­cific Stud­ies, in the English­language daily Ja­pan Times.</p>
    <p>“Al­lies have typ­i­cally re­ceived a few ex­tra bil­lets when Abe is in a po­si­tion of strength,” he said. “Ri­vals gained ex­tra post­ings when his ad­min­is­tra­tion was weak­ened by scan­dals or con­tro­ver­sial poli­cies.”</p>
    <p>The only con­stants across six Cabi­net reshuf­fles over the years were, in­ci­den­tally, Mr Aso and Mr Suga.</p>
    <p>TACIT NOD</p>
    <p>There are now seven fac­tions in the LDP, and Mr Suga’s two chal­lengers for the LDP pres­i­dent post – for­mer for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida, 63, and for­mer de­fence chief Shigeru Ishiba, 63 – lead their own fac­tions.</p>
    <p>But in a sign of the wan­ing in­flu­ence of guilds, the 77 in­de­pen­dent law­mak­ers, like Mr Suga and pop­u­lar En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Shin­jiro</p>
    <p>Koizumi, are only sec­ond to the Hosoda fac­tion, with 96 mem­bers.</p>
    <p>The tacit nod by Mr Abe to Mr Suga as his pre­ferred suc­ces­sor has swung the pen­du­lum in the LDP lead­er­ship race, with Mr Suga quickly win­ning the back­ing of all fac­tions ex­cept his ri­vals’. This has led to a com­mand­ing lead. Over 70 per cent of the LDP’s 394 law­mak­ers said they will vote for him.</p>
    <p>The rush to back Mr Suga has, how­ever, given rise to spec­u­la­tion that it is but a quid pro quo in ex­change for Cabi­net ap­point­ments.</p>
    <p>Dr Yu Uchiyama from the Univer­sity of Tokyo said: “Since the pres­i­dent holds most of the power in the LDP, peo­ple are afraid they will face reprisals, such as hav­ing po­si­tions with­held. It is likely a band­wagon ef­fect oc­curred.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, how­ever, in­sists he will not be bound by fac­tions.</p>
    <p>Dr Koichi Nakano of Sophia Univer­sity tells In­sight: “While fac­tions were once the train­ing ground for fu­ture lead­ers, to­day they no longer are in­flu­en­tial in mint­ing fu­ture PMs, but only back­ing fu­ture PMs.”</p>
