    <p>TAINAN The United States and China are wrestling to lead the world in ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, 5G wire­less and other cut­ting-edge tech­nolo­gies. But the real wiz­ardry that makes those ad­vance­ments pos­si­ble is be­ing per­formed on an is­land that sits be­tween them, ge­o­graph­i­cally and po­lit­i­cally.</p>
    <p>On Tai­wan’s south­ern rim, in­side an arena-size fa­cil­ity set among lush green­ery, colos­sal ma­chines are ma­nip­u­lat­ing mat­ter at unimag­in­ably tiny scale.</p>
    <p>A pow­er­ful laser vapourises droplets of molten tin, caus­ing them to emit ul­tra­vi­o­let light.</p>
    <p>Mir­rors fo­cus the light into a beam, which draws fea­tures into a sil­i­con wafer with the pre­ci­sion, as one re­searcher put it, “equiv­a­lent to shoot­ing an ar­row from Earth to hit an ap­ple placed on the Moon”.</p>
    <p>The high-per­for­mance com­puter chips that emerge from this process go into the brains of the lat­est tech prod­ucts from both sides of the Pa­cific. Or at least they did un­til last month, when the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ef­fec­tively forced lead­ing chip­mak­ers in Tai­wan – and else­where – to stop tak­ing or­ders from China’s proud­est tech cham­pion, 5G gi­ant Huawei.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion’s stran­gle­hold on Huawei shows that for all of China’s eco­nomic progress, the US still has fi­nal say over the tech­nolo­gies with­out which the mod­ern world could not run. Chip­mak­ing re­lies on US tools and know-how, which gives of­fi­cials in Wash­ing­ton the power of life and death over semi­con­duc­tor buy­ers and sup­pli­ers any­where on the planet.</p>
    <p>Next in the fir­ing line is China’s most ad­vanced chip pro­ducer, Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing In­ter­na­tional Cor­po­ra­tion (SMIC). The US De­part­ment of Com­merce told Amer­i­can com­pa­nies last week that they needed per­mis­sion to ex­port to SMIC, say­ing its chips could be used by China’s mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>If Wash­ing­ton blocks SMIC from us­ing Amer­i­can soft­ware and equip­ment en­tirely, it will sharply set back Bei­jing’s hopes for meet­ing more of its own semi­con­duc­tor needs.</p>
    <p>That leaves Tai­wanese chip com­pa­nies – in­clud­ing the in­dus­try’s lead­ing light, Tai­wan Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing Co (TSMC), which owns the Tainan plant – in a tough spot.</p>
    <p>They are forced to heed the dic­tates of US tech pol­icy. Yet they can scarcely ig­nore the fact that so many of their cus­tomers and their cus­tomers’ cus­tomers are in China, where the com­mu­nist gov­ern­ment is also threat­en­ing Tai­wan with ever bolder dis­plays of mil­i­tary force. China has, for decades, claimed the self-gov­ern­ing democ­racy as part of its ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>In the high-stakes tech fight, TSMC had been play­ing Fin­land: a some­time friend to both feud­ing gi­ants. But that is not the way the tech world works any­more.</p>
    <p>“China has vir­tu­ally no room for ma­noeu­vre,” said Mr Pierre Fer­ragu, head of tech­nol­ogy re­search at New Street Re­search. “The US def­i­nitely has the up­per hand in the strug­gle.”</p>
    <p>Ten­sions in the Tai­wan Strait are ris­ing more broadly this year.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has stepped up of­fi­cial ex­changes with Tai­wan since its Pres­i­dent, Ms Tsai Ing-wen, was re-elected in Jan­uary over a ri­val who was friend­lier to Bei­jing. In re­sponse, Chi­nese air­craft and war­ships have men­aced the is­land with grow­ing fre­quency.</p>
    <p>When State De­part­ment rep­re­sen­ta­tive Keith Krach vis­ited Tai­wan re­cently, Ms Tsai feted him at a ban­quet along­side a bevy of gov­ern­ment dig­ni­taries and TSMC’s re­tired founder, Mr Mor­ris Chang, a nod to the com­pany’s sig­nif­i­cance to Tai­wan’s re­la­tions with the US.</p>
    <p>US of­fi­cials have taken a great in­ter­est in TSMC, whose ad­vanced chips are used in fighter jets and other hard­ware crit­i­cal to Amer­ica’s mil­i­tary edge. The com­pany said this year that it would build a new fac­tory in Ari­zona, re­spond­ing to US con­cerns about over-re­liance on off­shore pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Now, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s cam­paign against Huawei has forced TSMC to turn against one of its big­gest cus­tomers. With the two com­pa­nies un­able to work to­gether with­out li­cences, Huawei may find it­self un­able to make its late-model hand­sets, an im­por­tant chunk of its business, once it uses up its chip in­ven­tory.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think Huawei has much of a fu­ture un­less they can find some way to get their sup­pli­ers to get ex­port li­cences,” said Mr Matt Bryson, an an­a­lyst with Wed­bush Securities.</p>
    <p>One of Huawei’s deputy chair­men, Mr Guo Ping, said last week that the com­pany was as­sess­ing its op­tions. “Sur­vival is our main goal,” Mr Guo said in Shang­hai. “As Alexan­dre Du­mas once said, all of hu­man wis­dom is summed up in two words: wait and hope.”</p>
    <p>TSMC ex­ec­u­tives sound con­fi­dent that Huawei’s plight will not dent it much. If Huawei can­not or­der chips from the com­pany, then its ri­vals will in­stead.</p>
    <p>Mr Mark Liu, TSMC’s chair­man, said at an in­dus­try con­fer­ence last week that Tai­wan would con­tinue im­prov­ing its tech­nol­ogy so US and Chi­nese com­pa­nies had no choice but to keep work­ing with the is­land.</p>
    <p>“We are en­joy­ing the suc­cess of the past,” Mr Liu said. But for the fu­ture, “we can­not stay where we used to be be­fore”.</p>
