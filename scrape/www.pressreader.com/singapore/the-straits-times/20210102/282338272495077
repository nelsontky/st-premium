    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s bor­der con­trol agency usu­ally op­er­ates on the outer reaches of the is­land but the pan­demic took of­fi­cers right up to res­i­dents’ doorsteps.</p>
    <p>That move into un­fa­mil­iar ter­ri­tory came in Fe­bru­ary last year, when the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Au­thor­ity (ICA) was tasked with manag­ing stay-home no­tices (SHNs) – a daunt­ing lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenge that ex­panded by the day.</p>
    <p>At its peak in April, there were more than 40,000 peo­ple serv­ing SHNs at the same time, and the ICA was mak­ing 8,000 calls and 1,000 house vis­its a day, said Deputy As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner Tan Hoe Koon, deputy di­rec­tor of ICA’s in­tel­li­gence divi­sion.</p>
    <p>The ICA had is­sued about 240,000 SHNs as at Nov 26 last year, with 11,807 still ac­tive.</p>
    <p>Any­one who ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore must re­main at home for 14 days and can­not leave even to buy food.</p>
    <p>DAC Tan said one chal­lenge was cre­at­ing a pro­to­col for how to con­duct en­force­ment checks, given that this was com­pletely new ground for the agency.</p>
    <p>The ICA ini­tially re­lied on man­ual meth­ods like get­ting peo­ple to re­port their lo­ca­tions via SMS or check­ing on them through calls and house vis­its.</p>
    <p>It went high-tech in early August with elec­tronic tam­per-proof wrist­bands to help mon­i­tor those serv­ing SHNs. Around 15,000 wrist­bands had been is­sued by Nov 26.</p>
    <p>The de­vices mean ICA of­fi­cers now have to make just one visit to each per­son on a SHN to en­sure the wrist­bands are worn prop­erly.</p>
