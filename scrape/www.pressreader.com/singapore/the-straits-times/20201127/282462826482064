    <p>NAPLES Few places will mourn the death of Diego Maradona as much as Naples, the down­trod­den, gritty Ital­ian city that clasped the trou­bled Ar­gen­tinian to its heart at his time of need and was re­paid with the best years of one of the great­est foot­ballers.</p>
    <p>Few play­ers have had such an ex­tra­or­di­nary in­flu­ence on a club as the 60-year-old had dur­ing his seven years with Napoli.</p>
    <p>The club won their only two Serie A ti­tles (1987, 1990) and their only ma­jor Euro­pean tro­phy – the 1989 Uefa Cup – while he was there but there was far more to it than those bare sta­tis­tics.</p>
    <p>Raised in dire poverty in Buenos Aires, Maradona al­ways took the side of the op­pressed, which made Napoli, sneered at by the richer clubs from north­ern Italy, the perfect team for him.</p>
    <p>So was Naples, whose long­stand­ing con­nec­tions with the Ital­ian mafia gave it a rep­u­ta­tion it still finds hard to shake off till to­day, yet to the 1986 World Cup win­ner, it re­minded him of his ori­gins.</p>
    <p>Buildings around the city are adorned with de­pic­tions and mu­rals of the man who gave its res­i­dents hope when there was none.</p>
    <p>Even though gath­er­ings re­main banned as Naples has been clas­si­fied as a Covid-19 “red zone”, hun­dreds of Napoli fans con­gre­gated on the streets.</p>
    <p>Many more lit can­dles out­side San Paolo Sta­dium, lay­ing flow­ers and wreaths, and set­ting off fire­works and flares as they paid trib­ute to the Serie A club’s great­est player on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>In a sign of mourn­ing, Napoli changed its usual blue logo on its Twit­ter ac­count to black, tweet­ing “now is the moment for tears” and there are “no words we can use for the pain that we are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing”.</p>
    <p>Naples Mayor Luigi de Mag­istris im­me­di­ately or­dered that the sta­dium’s lights be turned on all night and a day of mourn­ing took place yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With the bless­ing of Napoli pres­i­dent Aure­lio de Lau­ren­tiis, he yes­ter­day be­gan the for­mal process to re­name the sta­dium in hon­our of Maradona.</p>
    <p>“We are al­ready putting it to­gether this morn­ing, tak­ing the first steps to ded­i­cate Naples sta­dium to Maradona,” Mr de Mag­istris said. “We’re hop­ing to make it (the process) co­in­cide with the re­sump­tion of games with fans.</p>
    <p>“Yes, he was also a con­tro­ver­sial man. But for us, Maradona is the one who made Naples and Neapoli­tans dream – with his ge­nius, his unique­ness, he gave us hap­pi­ness.</p>
    <p>“Many have named their sons Diego, for he was able to re­deem a city that was of­ten the tar­get of prej­u­dices and dis­crim­i­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Other fa­mous Neapoli­tans paid homage to the city’s favourite son, who be­came an hon­orary cit­i­zen in 2017.</p>
    <p>Italy’s 2006 World Cup-win­ning cap­tain Fabio Can­navaro said: “Maradona is a God to the peo­ple of Naples. Maradona changed his­tory.”</p>
