    <p>Two can­di­dates from the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party’s (PSP) los­ing team in West Coast GRC have been de­clared elected Non-Con­stituency MPs.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong Mun Wai and Ms Hazel Poa were cho­sen by their party to take up the two seats when the 14th Par­lia­ment sits at a date to be an­nounced later.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the Elec­tions Depart­ment said the PSP had in­formed Re­turn­ing Of­fi­cer Tan Meng Dui of its de­ci­sion to nom­i­nate the two can­di­dates for the NCMP seats.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan had writ­ten to the PSP on Mon­day, ask­ing the party to in­form him who it is nom­i­nat­ing to take up the seats. The PSP gave its de­ci­sion on Tues­day, ahead of the July 20 dead­line, the state­ment added.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong, 60, is the party’s as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral, while Ms Poa, 49, is its vice-chair­man. They were part of the PSP team in West Coast GRC that emerged the top loser in last Fri­day’s elec­tion, thus be­com­ing el­i­gi­ble for the NCMP seats.</p>
    <p>The team, led by PSP chief Tan</p>
    <p>Cheng Bock, se­cured 48.31 per cent of the votes against a Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party team led by Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Min­is­ter S. Iswaran.</p>
    <p>The min­i­mum num­ber of op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment was in­creased from nine to 12 as a re­sult of changes made to the NCMP scheme in 2016. The changes also give NCMPs the same vot­ing rights as elected MPs.</p>
    <p>In last Fri­day’s elec­tion, the Work­ers’ Party (WP) won Alju­nied GRC, Sengkang GRC and Hougang SMC – re­sult­ing in 10 WP mem­bers be­ing elected to Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>That left two NCMP seats va­cant for op­po­si­tion MPs to fill.</p>
    <p>Ms Poa on Tues­day said that as an NCMP, she will help to rep­re­sent the views of vot­ers who sup­ported the team in the gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>She said: “This is an op­por­tu­nity for us to bring their voices into Par­lia­ment. So we will want to, over the next five years, con­tinue to en­gage West Coast res­i­dents to find out in more de­tail what their is­sues are, be­cause we ac­tu­ally haven’t had much time be­fore this.”</p>
    <p>Mr Leong said he and Ms Poa will be sup­ported by a PSP team made up of younger mem­bers who have stood for elec­tions be­fore and are “quite qual­i­fied”. The PSP will also tap pro­fes­sion­als and ex­perts from out­side the party, he added.</p>
    <p>He said that both of them are look­ing for­ward to work­ing with WP chief and Alju­nied GRC MP Pri­tam Singh and his party. Mr Singh is set to be ap­pointed Leader of the Op­po­si­tion, the first time such a po­si­tion has been for­malised.</p>
