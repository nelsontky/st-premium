    <p>The show­cases re­main cu­rated un­der last year’s main themes of The Iconic, Legacy, Style Inc., The Ad­vo­cacy, and Rare and Pre­cious – with pieces from ac­claimed de­sign­ers like Ma­rina Bul­gari, Paolo Costagli and the late Roberto Faraone Mennella (whose jew­els ap­peared on Amer­i­can tele­vi­sion show Sex And The City).</p>
    <p>Un­able to fly in for­eign de­sign­ers to grace the fes­ti­val, Ms Loh has ar­ranged a line-up of lo­cal col­lec­tors, style icons and in­flu­encers to give talks.</p>
    <p>They in­clude so­cialite-lawyer Tan Min-Li, who will give tips on styling iconic Paolo Costagli jew­ellery; as well as owner of MTM Sk­in­care Kelly Keak, who will be in con­ver­sa­tion with Italian jew­ellery brand Leonori on pair­ing jew­ellery with beau­ti­ful skin.</p>
    <p>Some for­eign de­sign­ers will be di­alling into live streams dur­ing the free two-hour ses­sions, to in­ter­act with cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>A lim­ited num­ber of slots for each ses­sion will be open for pub­lic reg­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>With JeweLuxe go­ing into the heart­land, Ms Loh be­lieves par­tic­i­pat­ing brands will get more ex­po­sure to shop­pers this year, com­pared with when they had just 10 days in the JeweLuxe tent.</p>
    <p>“Now peo­ple are go­ing to see the jew­ellery in stores – in malls all the way in Tampines or Jurong.</p>
    <p>“It’s a bless­ing in dis­guise – we get to ex­pand aware­ness of what in­ter­na­tional de­sign­ers of jew­ellery and watches are all about.”</p>
    <p>AF­FORD­ABLE PIECES</p>
    <p>Go­ing into the heart­land means more af­ford­able jew­ellery pieces are on show too, with prices from as low as $800, says Ms Loh, who cu­rated the se­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers can ex­pect ready-towear pieces from Rus­sian la­bel P&P Jew­ellery at prices start­ing from $3,000 – the high jew­ellery pieces are usu­ally val­ued at more than a few hun­dred thou­sand dol­lars; while Italian brand Sicis Jew­els’ pieces are avail­able at Lee Hwa Jew­ellery for less than $5,000.</p>
    <p>“That’s what the mar­ket wants right now – de­signer pieces that are easily ac­ces­si­ble,” Ms Loh says.</p>
    <p>The ex­tended du­ra­tion of the fes­ti­val also works out in tough times like this, where shop­pers “don’t just rush into buy­ing like in preCovid times”, she adds.</p>
    <p>“Now, they will take some time to think about it and by the time they get round to (mak­ing pur­chases), it’s three weeks later. I’m just go­ing along with the mood of the peo­ple right now.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kean Ng, se­nior di­rec­tor of jew­ellery busi­ness at Aspial-Lee Hwa Jew­ellery, which owns Lee Hwa Jew­ellery and Gold­heart Jew­elry, says turnout at its stores has been “great” so far.</p>
    <p>“Our bou­tiques have seen en­cour­ag­ing traf­fic from reg­u­lars as well as new cus­tomers as they seek new jew­ellery to add to their col­lec­tions or for spe­cial oc­ca­sions,” he adds.</p>
    <p>“Other t han cus­tomers who come spe­cially to check out the brands, our reg­u­lars were cu­ri­ous about the JeweLuxe cu­rated brands – such as Khoe and D’or­ica in par­tic­i­pat­ing Gold­heart bou­tiques, and Paolo Costagli and P&P Jew­ellery at Lee Hwa bou­tiques.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the longer run, Ms Loh is con­fi­dent of the fes­ti­val’s turnout, be­liev­ing that buy­ing sen­ti­ment may im­prove early next year.</p>
    <p>“Jew­ellery has a way of mak­ing peo­ple feel a cer­tain way – a lit­tle more con­fi­dent and ready to take on the world,” she says.</p>
    <p>“We chose this year’s mes­sage, ‘You Are Ex­cep­tional’, be­cause we want peo­ple to feel good, re­dis­cover them­selves and feel happy again.”</p>
