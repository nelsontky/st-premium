    <p>We thank Fo­rum con­trib­u­tor Saito Kaoru for the sug­ges­tion in the let­ter (Give donors ac­cess to records, Dec 23, 2020).</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, blood donors are screened to en­sure they are suitable to do­nate blood, and the do­nated blood is tested. This is for the safety of blood donors and that of pa­tients re­ceiv­ing blood.</p>
    <p>Be­fore a blood do­na­tion, we per­form a fin­ger-prick test to en­sure that the donor meets the haemoglobi­n re­quire­ment and is not anaemic.</p>
    <p>The med­i­cal screen­ing per­son­nel also checks the donor’s med­i­cal history, blood pres­sure and tem­per­a­ture to en­sure that the donor is well and fit for do­na­tion.</p>
    <p>All do­nated blood is screened for HIV, hep­ati­tis B, hep­ati­tis C and syphilis. Ad­di­tional tests such as screen­ing for malaria may be con­ducted for se­lected at-risk units.</p>
    <p>If donors do not hear from us af­ter their do­na­tion, it means there is no ab­nor­mal­ity in their test re­sults.</p>
    <p>The do­nated blood is screened for these in­fec­tious dis­eases to pre­vent disease trans­mis­sion to re­cip­i­ents. It is not tested for other pa­ram­e­ters, such as choles­terol level, which may in­di­cate whether the donor has non-com­mu­ni­ca­ble chronic dis­eases.</p>
    <p>The test­ing of do­nated blood is not meant for health screen­ing pur­poses, which donors can get from other health­care fa­cil­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­tary non-re­mu­ner­ated blood do­na­tion is prac­tised in Sin­ga­pore. This is aligned with the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the In­ter­na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Red Cross and Red Cres­cent So­ci­eties.</p>
    <p>The pol­icy of non-re­mu­ner­ated blood do­na­tions pro­vides a safety check, so that donors are not mo­ti­vated by in­cen­tives such as free health screen­ing to with­hold im­por­tant in­for­ma­tion about their med­i­cal his­to­ries and risky ac­tiv­i­ties. This could af­fect their own health and the safety of pa­tients who re­ceive the do­nated blood.</p>
    <p>It is for this rea­son that we do not con­duct any test­ing re­lated to the gen­eral health of blood donors, other than what is needed to en­sure the do­nated blood is safe.</p>
    <p>We are thank­ful to all donors who have stepped for­ward to sup­port the Na­tional Blood Pro­gramme self­lessly and gen­er­ously. Your do­na­tions save lives, and make this so­ci­ety a kinder place for all.</p>
