    <p>An in­crease in the cap set on gov­ern­ment bor­row­ing via Trea­sury bills and gov­ern­ment se­cu­ri­ties was ap­proved by Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day. This will cater to the ex­pected growth in de­mand for these debt in­stru­ments over the next five years.</p>
    <p>The in­crease raises the bor­row­ing limit for Trea­sury bills by $45 billion to $105 billion and for gov­ern­ment se­cu­ri­ties by $270 billion to $960 billion.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing a mo­tion to seek ap­proval for the changes yes­ter­day, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance Lawrence Wong stressed that the bor­row­ings are in­vested and do not in­crease the amount avail­able for gov­ern­ment spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Gov­ern­ment Se­cu­ri­ties Act, Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment Se­cu­ri­ties can be is­sued to de­velop the do­mes­tic debt mar­ket.</p>
    <p>It also au­tho­rises the is­suance of Spe­cial Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment Se­cu­ri­ties, which are bonds is­sued to the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF). The bonds is­sued in this case are to pay the CPF in­ter­est rates that CPF mem­bers get on their sav­ings.</p>
    <p>Trea­sury bills, un­der the Lo­cal Trea­sury Bills Act, are also is­sued to de­velop the do­mes­tic short-term debt mar­ket and to meet mar­ket de­mand for short-term rated Sin­ga­pore gov­ern­ment debt se­cu­ri­ties.</p>
    <p>Bor­row­ing caps for gov­ern­ment se­cu­ri­ties and Trea­sury bills were last raised in 2016 and 2007 re­spec­tively. Since then, the Gov­ern­ment has fully utilised the pre­vail­ing limit on the is­suance of Trea­sury bills. The pre­vail­ing limit on gov­ern­ment se­cu­ri­ties will also be reached be­fore the mid­dle of this year, noted Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the pro­jected in­crease in gov­ern­ment se­cu­ri­ties by the end of 2025 is ex­pected to be is­sued to the CPF to meet in­vest­ment needs, said Mr Wong. “We ex­pect CPF bal­ances to in­crease due to growth in the res­i­dent labour force and wages,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will also put in place a new short-term cash man­age­ment tool, where Trea­sury bills can be is­sued on an ad-hoc ba­sis to meet tem­po­rary cash-flow mis­matches, said Mr Wong.</p>
