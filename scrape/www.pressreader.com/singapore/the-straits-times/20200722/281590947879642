    <p>A sec­re­tary was aware that her Singapore-based firm and re­lated com­pa­nies were un­law­fully sup­ply­ing lux­ury items to North Korea, but she failed to alert the au­thor­i­ties as she feared los­ing her job. She was fined $6,000 yes­ter­day af­ter plead­ing guilty to three charges un­der the United Na­tions Act.</p>
    <p>A sec­re­tary was aware that her Singapore-based firm and re­lated com­pa­nies were un­law­fully sup­ply­ing lux­ury items to North Korea but she failed to alert the au­thor­i­ties as she feared los­ing her job.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Lam Hon Lan, 40, was fined $6,000 yes­ter­day af­ter plead­ing guilty to three charges un­der the United Na­tions Act in­volv­ing per­fumes and cos­met­ics worth more than $82,000.</p>
    <p>The court con­sid­ered 40 other sim­i­lar charges in­volv­ing goods worth nearly $500,000 dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>UN sanc­tions pro­hibit people in Singapore or Sin­ga­pore­ans out­side the country from sell­ing or sup­ply­ing cer­tain lux­ury items to any­one in North Korea.</p>
    <p>Any­one with in­for­ma­tion about such trans­ac­tions must alert the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said in an ear­lier state­ment that Lam, who was work­ing for SCN Singapore at the time of the of­fences, also han­dled ad­min­is­tra­tive mat­ters for two other firms – Sin­dok Trad­ing and Lau­rich In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>The court heard yes­ter­day that these com­pa­nies un­law­fully sup­plied lux­ury items to four North Korean or­gan­i­sa­tions from De­cem­ber 2010 to Novem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>One of them, the Korean Bugsae Shop, was owned by North Korean Li Ik.</p>
    <p>Li Ik’s son, Li Hyon, had stud­ied in Singapore be­fore help­ing his fa­ther with the lux­ury goods busi­ness here.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Thiam Jia Min said that the bulk of the lux­ury items was sup­plied by SCN Singapore di­rectly to the shop.</p>
    <p>The items were then shipped to North Korea – by air through Bei­jing or on freight ves­sels via Dalian in China, as well as by hand through air­port check-ins.</p>
    <p>Lam’s job in­cluded sourc­ing the lux­ury items and is­su­ing ex­port doc­u­ments, as well as ar­rang­ing for ship­ments to the North Korean or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>The of­fences came to light af­ter Singapore’s Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment re­ceived in­for­ma­tion that SCN Singapore had “sig­nif­i­cant sales” to more than one en­tity in North Korea.</p>
    <p>Li Hyon, 32, was jailed for four weeks last month af­ter plead­ing guilty to four counts of en­gag­ing in a con­spir­acy with other people and two com­pa­nies – in­clud­ing SCN Singapore – to de­liver lux­ury goods like cos­met­ics and spir­its to North Korea.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing SCN Singapore, Sin­dok Trad­ing and Lau­rich In­ter­na­tional are pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Com­mit­ting of­fences un­der the Act be­fore March 10, 2014, can bring jail terms of up to five years and fines.</p>
    <p>Of­fences com­mit­ted af­ter March 10, 2014, can re­sult in jail of up to 10 years and fines.</p>
    <p>Lam, who was work­ing for SCN Singapore at the time of the of­fences, also han­dled ad­min­is­tra­tive mat­ters for two other firms – Sin­dok Trad­ing and Lau­rich In­ter­na­tional... Lam’s job in­cluded sourc­ing the lux­ury items and is­su­ing ex­port doc­u­ments as well as ar­rang­ing for ship­ments to the North Korean or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
