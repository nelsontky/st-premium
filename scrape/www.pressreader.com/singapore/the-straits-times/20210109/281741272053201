    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The mob that stormed the US Capi­tol on Wed­nes­day did not just threaten the heart of Amer­i­can democ­racy.</p>
    <p>To sci­en­tists who watched in dis­may as the scenes un­folded on tele­vi­sion, the throngs of un­masked in­trud­ers who wan­dered through the build­ing’s hall­ways and into pri­vate of­fices may have trans­formed the riot into a su­per­spreader event.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus thrives in­doors, par­tic­u­larly in crowded spa­ces, lin­ger­ing in the air in tiny par­ti­cles called aerosols. If even a few peo­ple were in­fected – likely, given the cur­rent rates of spread and the crowd size – then the virus would have had the ideal op­por­tu­nity to find new vic­tims, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>“It has all the el­e­ments of what we warn peo­ple about,” said Dr Anne Ri­moin, a public health re­searcher at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Los An­ge­les. “Peo­ple yelling and scream­ing, chant­ing, ex­ert­ing them­selves – all of those things pro­vide op­por­tu­nity for the virus to spread, and this virus takes those op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has down­played the Covid-19 pan­demic al­most since its be­gin­ning, and many of his sup­port­ers who en­tered the Capi­tol did not ap­pear to be wear­ing masks or mak­ing any ef­fort at so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­der sim­i­lar con­di­tions, gath­er­ings held in such close quar­ters have led to fast-spread­ing clus­ters of in­fec­tion. But trans­mis­sion of the virus has al­ways been dif­fi­cult to track.</p>
    <p>There is lit­tle ef­fec­tive con­tact trac­ing in the United States, and many in the crowd at the Capi­tol had ar­rived from com­mu­ni­ties far from Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>The Black Lives Mat­ter protests in the sum­mer raised sim­i­lar con­cerns. But most were held out­doors, and greater num­bers of par­tic­i­pants seemed to be masked.</p>
    <p>Re­search af­ter­wards sug­gested these were not su­per­spread­ing events. At­ten­dees of the rally pre­ced­ing the rush to the Capi­tol on Wed­nes­day had also stood out­doors close to­gether for hours, but “I’m less wor­ried about what was hap­pen­ing out­doors”, Dr Ri­moin said. “The risk in­creases ex­po­nen­tially in­doors.”</p>
    <p>Three dis­tinct groups – Capi­tol Po­lice, ri­ot­ers and mem­bers of Congress – “were spend­ing time in­doors, with­out so­cial dis­tanc­ing, for long pe­ri­ods of time”, Dr Joshua Baro­cas, an in­fec­tious dis­eases physi­cian at Bos­ton Univer­sity, pointed out.</p>
    <p>The melee likely was a su­per­spreader event, he added, “es­pe­cially given the back­drop of the highly trans­mis­si­ble vari­ants that are cir­cu­lat­ing”.</p>
    <p>Dr Baro­cas was re­fer­ring to a highly con­ta­gious new vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus, first iden­ti­fied in Bri­tain. Cases have been re­ported in sev­eral US states, and the vari­ant may well have spread ev­ery­where in the coun­try, mak­ing events like the Capi­tol riot even more risky, he said.</p>
    <p>“I am wor­ried not only that it could lead to su­per­spread­ing, but also su­per­spread­ing to peo­ple who are elected of­fi­cials,” said Dr Tom In­gelsby, di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre for Health Se­cu­rity at the Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p>
    <p>Also, in­fected mem­bers of Congress and law en­force­ment could have spread the virus to one an­other as they shel­tered from the vi­o­lence, he noted.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Jake LaTurner an­nounced on Twit­ter early Thurs­day morn­ing that he had tested pos­i­tive for the virus. Mr LaTurner was clois­tered in the cham­ber with other mem­bers of Congress for much of the day.</p>
    <p>At least a dozen of the 400 or so law­mak­ers and staff who were hud­dling in one com­mit­tee room re­fused to wear masks even af­ter be­ing of­fered one, or wore them im­prop­erly be­low their chins, said Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Su­san Wild.</p>
    <p>They were gath­ered in a com­mit­tee room that quickly be­came crowded, mak­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing im­pos­si­ble, she said. Some of the law­mak­ers were un­masked, and sev­eral were shout­ing.</p>
    <p>“Ten­sions were high, and peo­ple were yelling at each other,” Ms Wild said. “I just started get­ting re­ally kind of an­gry, think­ing about the re­cent hol­i­days, and how so many peo­ple did not spend time with their im­me­di­ate fam­i­lies for fear of spread­ing,” she added, re­fer­ring to her un­masked col­leagues.</p>
    <p>The risk for mem­bers of Congress will de­pend greatly on ven­ti­la­tion in the room where they shel­tered, said Dr Joseph Allen, an ex­pert on build­ings qual­ity at the Har­vard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in Bos­ton.</p>
    <p>“If there is a well-de­signed se­cure fa­cil­ity, then it would have great ven­ti­la­tion and fil­tra­tion,” Dr Allen said. “If it’s a place where they were just hun­kered down wher­ever they could go that was safe, and it was not a place that was de­signed like that, then we don’t re­ally know.”</p>
    <p>It is nat­u­ral in a heart-pound­ing cri­sis to dis­re­gard risks that seem in­tan­gi­ble or the­o­ret­i­cal, he and other sci­en­tists noted.</p>
    <p>“You can­not keep dis­tance if you’re try­ing to leave a very in­tense and dan­ger­ous sit­u­a­tion,” said Dr Seema Lak­dawala, an ex­pert in res­pi­ra­tory virus trans­mis­sion at the Univer­sity of Pitts­burgh. “You’re weigh­ing the risk of your life over the risk of get­ting a virus at that mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of Congress re­turned to con­tinue the elec­toral count af­ter the ri­ot­ers were cleared from the Capi­tol.</p>
    <p>Some leg­is­la­tors took off their masks be­fore giv­ing a speech, Dr Baro­cas noted, at pre­cisely the time when they needed to wear them. Talk­ing at a high vol­ume can ex­pel vast quan­ti­ties of aerosols, pro­pel­ling them through an en­closed space.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists have doc­u­mented in­fec­tious aerosols sus­pended in air nearly 6m from an in­fected per­son. And a re­cent study from South Korea found that two peo­ple be­came in­fected af­ter spend­ing just five min­utes in a restau­rant, 4.5m away from an in­fected pa­tron.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts fear that ri­ot­ers head­ing back home could set off new chains of in­fec­tion, per­haps im­pos­si­ble to track.</p>
    <p>“We might get an in­kling into how bad it might be be­cause of the fed­eral em­ploy­ees,” Dr Baro­cas said. But he added: “I don’t think that we’re go­ing to know the ex­tent of this su­per­spreader event.”</p>
    <p>At least a dozen of the 400 or so law­mak­ers and staff who were hud­dling in one com­mit­tee room re­fused to wear masks even af­ter be­ing of­fered one, or wore them im­prop­erly... said Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Su­san Wild. They were gath­ered in a com­mit­tee room that quickly be­came crowded, mak­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing im­pos­si­ble, she said.</p>
