    <p>TOKYO • Wel­come cer­e­monies for ath­letes will be scrapped and flashy spec­ta­cles axed at a scaled­back Tokyo 2020 Games, or­gan­is­ers said yes­ter­day, but a se­nior Olympic of­fi­cial in­sisted the event “has to hap­pen”.</p>
    <p>Fewer free tick­ets and sav­ings on ban­ners, mas­cots and fire­works are among more than 50 cost-cut­ting mea­sures agreed by or­gan­is­ers and Olympic of­fi­cials, less than a year be­fore the virus-post­poned event be­gins next July.</p>
    <p>De­spite the com­pli­ca­tions and ex­tra costs of the de­lay, and con­tin­ued un­cer­tainty about how the Games can be held safely, In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) vice-pres­i­dent John Coates said can­cel­la­tion was not an op­tion.</p>
    <p>“It would have been very easy for you to say, ‘This isn’t pos­si­ble’,” he said via video link af­ter a meet­ing of or­gan­is­ers and Olympic of­fi­cials in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>“But I think we all share the view that this has to be pos­si­ble... be­cause we can­not dis­re­gard a gen­er­a­tion of Olympic ath­letes.”</p>
    <p>Doc­u­ments re­leased by or­gan­is­ers painted a pic­ture of a less-thanop­u­lent event, with the size of be­hind-the-scenes del­e­ga­tions re­duced by 10 to 15 per cent, and perks cut back.</p>
    <p>Pre­sen­ta­tion cer­e­monies to in­tro­duce each sport should be pro­duced in “bare-min­i­mum qual­ity and quan­tity”, the doc­u­ments said, while wel­com­ing cer­e­monies for Olympic and Par­a­lympic teams will be scrapped al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of ath­letes will not be re­duced, or­gan­is­ers pledged, but of­fi­cials, press and oth­ers in­volved with the Games will be given fewer com­pli­men­tary tick­ets to the open­ing and clos­ing cere</p>
    <p>monies.</p>
    <p>Changes to the usu­ally daz­zling con­tents of those events are also un­der re­view.</p>
    <p>“What was ini­tially pro­posed (for the cer­e­monies) has been dras­ti­cally chang­ing,” said Yoshiro Mori, pres­i­dent of the Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>“Maybe it will end up a bit more mod­est and sim­ple, but I hope it will be some­thing that gives joy.”</p>
    <p>Tokyo 2020’s lat­est bud­get is for US$12.6 bil­lion (S$17.35 bil­lion) – with costs set to bal­loon fur­ther as venues and trans­port must be re­booked, and staff re­tained for an ex­tra year.</p>
    <p>Other cost-cut­ting plans in­clude</p>
    <p>giv­ing ath­letes less time to train at venues, and con­sol­i­dat­ing se­cu­rity points, rais­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of longer queues for bag checks.</p>
    <p>Coates de­scribed the re­vised plans as a blue­print for “a new Games, fit for a post-corona world” that could be used in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to leave an im­por­tant legacy which we’re call­ing the Tokyo Model,” he added.</p>
    <p>On how to safely hold the Games if the pan­demic is not un­der con­trol, Coates said mea­sures in­clud­ing reg­u­lar Covid-19 test­ing and manda­tory vac­ci­na­tion – if a vac­cine is avail­able</p>
