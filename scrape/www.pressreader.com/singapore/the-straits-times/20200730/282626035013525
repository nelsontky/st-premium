    <p>X-Men star Ellen Page is play­ing a superhero again, but this time, it is a role a bit closer to her in­die-cin­ema roots.</p>
    <p>The Cana­dian ac­tress landed her big break with the in­de­pen­dent film Juno (2007), a quirky com­ing-of-age com­edy that saw her play a teenager grap­pling with an un­planned preg­nancy, un­ex­pect­edly land­ing the young per­former a Best Ac­tress Os­car nom­i­na­tion at the age of 20.</p>
    <p>That, along with come­dies such as Whip It (2009) and Smart Peo­ple (2008), es­tab­lished Page as some­thing of an in­die dar­ling.</p>
    <p>And given that re­sume, her role as superhero Kitty Pryde in the big, noisy block­busters X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and X-Men: Days Of Fu­ture Past (2014) were a bit of a de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>Yet Page has cho­sen to wield su­per pow­ers on screen again for the Net­flix se­ries The Um­brella Academy, which de­buted last year and re­turns for a se­cond sea­son to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Chat­ting to The Straits Times in a video call from Los An­ge­les, she hints that this more long-form, char­ac­ter-driven yarn might be the more ful­fill­ing superhero role.</p>
    <p>“I know they’re both su­per­heroes, but this is a very dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ence for me,” says the 33-year-old.</p>
    <p>“There wasn’t a whole lot that I got to do with Kitty Pryde in those films,” she notes of her Mar­vel Comics avatar, a girl who can walk through walls.</p>
    <p>The Um­brella Academy, on the other hand, is the story of an es­tranged fam­ily of sib­lings adopted as chil­dren by bil­lion­aire in­dus­tri­al­ist Regi­nald Har­greeves, who groomed them to save the world from an apoc­a­lypse some day.</p>
    <p>It is based on the Eis­ner-win­ning Dark Horse Comics se­ries of the same name cre­ated by Gerard Way, lead singer of the rock band My Chem­i­cal Ro­mance.</p>
    <p>Page plays one of the sib­lings, Vanya, who is ini­tially thought to be the only one with no su­per­nat­u­ral tal­ents. But it is later dis­cov­ered that she has for­mi­da­ble abil­i­ties which were sup­pressed and hid­den by her fa­ther.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress ap­pre­ci­ates the fact that the show is a fam­ily story at heart, with the ac­tion and spec­ta­cle the ic­ing on the cake.</p>
    <p>“What I love as an ac­tor is that the core of the show is a fam­ily drama. It’s about all these in­di­vid­u­als who suf­fered a lot of trauma and abuse as chil­dren. We’re see­ing that man­i­fest in their lives and ex­plor­ing those el­e­ments.”</p>
    <p>“And so much of the superhero stuff – all the ex­cit­ing, fun stuff like the spec­ta­cle and the ac­tion – I feel like that just com­ple­ments it,” says Page, who also ap­peared in the sci­ence-fic­tion ad­ven­ture In­cep­tion (2010).</p>
    <p>The ac­tress prom­ises that Sea­son 2 will dive even deeper into what makes each of the Har­greeves sib­lings tick. “We’re re­ally ex­plor­ing the hu­man­ity of these char­ac­ters.”</p>
    <p>Her char­ac­ter, Vanya, will also con­tinue to evolve, which Page says is what she loves most about work­ing on this show.</p>
    <p>“It’s been the arc she has been able to go on, and the same goes for my­self as an ac­tor. In the first sea­son, we see a very ex­treme arc and I re­ally en­joyed try­ing to create that and, hope­fully, be sub­tle and nu­anced as that’s hap­pen­ing.”</p>
    <p>In Sea­son 2, Vanya has “got­ten a lot off her chest – although it didn’t nec­es­sar­ily ben­e­fit the world”, the ac­tress says.</p>
    <p>“But where we find her, she’s just much more open and com­fort­able. She re­ally starts to find her au­then­tic voice, con­nect with peo­ple and falls in love for the first time.”</p>
    <p>“And she con­tin­ues that growth through the se­cond sea­son. Those are the things I re­ally en­joy as an ac­tor,” says Page, who is mar­ried to Cana­dian dancer and chore­og­ra­pher Emma Port­ner, 25.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the char­ac­ters will find them­selves trav­el­ling through time to dif­fer­ent eras. This sea­son takes them back half a cen­tury, which the star says was a lot of fun to film, es­pe­cially with the pe­riod cos­tumes and sets.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing it set in the 1960s and also ex­plor­ing a lot of is­sues that were oc­cur­ring in that time and are still very much rel­e­vant to­day – it’s so en­joy­able to be a part of this show,” she says.</p>
