    <p>Back in Novem­ber, it was pos­si­ble to dis­miss the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s an­titrust suit against Google as too weak, too nar­row and too late. But now more than 40 states – and the Fed­eral Trade Com­mis­sion – have filed suit against an­other tech gi­ant: Face­book.</p>
    <p>It seems un­likely to be the last ma­jor law­suit against tech­nol­ogy giants. Though these cases are os­ten­si­bly about an­titrust vi­o­la­tions, they are a sign of some­thing big­ger: the re­vival of a long­stand­ing anti-monopoly tra­di­tion in the United States. This par­tic­u­lar view of large, pow­er­ful cor­po­ra­tions – as threats to the po­lit­i­cal or­der – has re­peat­edly played a sig­nif­i­cant role in the na­tion’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>As his­to­rian Richard John has ob­served, anti-monopoly is of­ten con­fused and con­flated with an­titrust. In fact, it long pre­dates an­titrust law. In the 17th cen­tury, eco­nomic writ­ers started warn­ing of the eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal dan­gers posed by cor­po­ra­tions. Much of their in­dict­ment fo­cused on cor­po­ra­tions char­tered by Par­lia­ment that en­joyed ex­plicit, ex­clu­sive trad­ing rights.</p>
    <p>In 1600, for ex­am­ple, the East In­dia Com­pany was granted a monopoly over Bri­tish trade with Asia. Goods in­cluded silks, spices and tea. Most Amer­i­cans know a lit­tle bit about the Bos­ton Tea Party in 1773. But a key part of the story is of­ten left out: The pro­test­ers dumped the tea over­board be­cause they viewed the East In­dia Com­pany as an il­le­git­i­mate monopoly.</p>
    <p>Un­der the terms of the so-called “Tea Act” passed by Par­lia­ment, they had no choice but to buy their tea from a com­pany cho­sen by the govern­ment. One critic, for ex­am­ple, voiced the fol­low­ing ob­jec­tion: “The first Teas may be sold at a low Rate to make a pop­u­lar En­try, yet when this mode of re­ceiv­ing Tea is well es­tab­lished, they, as all other Mo­nop­o­lists do, will me­di­ate a greater profit on their Goods, and set them up at what Price they please.”</p>
    <p>Adam Smith couldn’t have said it bet­ter – and echoed the point in The Wealth Of Na­tions, first pub­lished in 1776 – the same year the Amer­i­cans de­clared their in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>A MON­STER TOO POW­ER­FUL TO CON­TROL</p>
    <p>But where Smith’s cri­tique fo­cused more on the eco­nomic im­pli­ca­tions of mo­nop­o­lis­tic be­hav­iour, the Amer­i­cans em­pha­sised the po­lit­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions of con­cen­trated eco­nomic power. As one his­to­rian of this episode ob­served, their ob­jec­tion was not about price; it was about prin­ci­ple. In this for­mu­la­tion, mo­nop­o­lies threat­ened to de­stroy lib­erty it­self.</p>
    <p>It was what one de­scribed as a “mon­ster, too pow­er­ful for us to con­trol”. An­other warned that if the East In­dia Com­pany got a foothold in Amer­ica, “they will leave no stone un­turned to be­come your Mas­ters... they (will) be­come the most pow­er­ful</p>
    <p>Trad­ing Com­pany in the</p>
    <p>Uni­verse”.</p>
    <p>The idea that mo­nop­o­lies would in­evitably cor­rupt the po­lit­i­cal sys­tem and in­fringe on lib­er­ties sur­vived the Amer­i­can Revo­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>In the early repub­lic, any­one who wanted to start a cor­po­ra­tion had to se­cure spe­cial dis­pen­sa­tion from a state leg­is­la­ture. This irked anti-mo­nop­o­lists, who rightly pointed out that this gave po­lit­i­cally con­nected in­di­vid­u­als the abil­ity to se­cure a char­ter – and thwart po­ten­tial com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>The so­lu­tion that Amer­i­cans ul­ti­mately em­braced was not to stop is­su­ing cor­po­rate char­ters – much less na­tion­alise in­dus­tries that could eas­ily be dom­i­nated by a sin­gle firm – but to make it eas­ier to ob­tain a char­ter. The coun­try pi­o­neered gen­eral in­cor­po­ra­tion laws that made it pos­si­ble to start new busi­nesses with­out re­course to the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>THE WAR ON THE BANK OF THE UNITED STATES</p>
    <p>Yet there was one in­sti­tu­tion that con­tin­ued to en­joy an un­usual monopoly: the Bank of the United States. This cor­po­ra­tion, char­tered by Congress, had a unique role in the larger fi­nan­cial sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Though pri­vate, it served as the fi­nan­cial arm of the fed­eral govern­ment – at least un­til</p>
    <p>An­drew Jack­son be­came pres­i­dent in 1829. His so-called Bank War con­sumed the na­tion for sev­eral years, be­gin­ning when Jack­son ve­toed a Bill rechar­ter­ing the bank.</p>
    <p>In his now fa­mous veto mes­sage, Jack­son as­sailed the fact that the bank en­joyed a “monopoly” on busi­ness with the govern­ment, and warned of the “great evils” posed by the bank, which vested a tremen­dous amount of power in the “hands of elites not re­spon­sive to the will of the peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>This was the clas­sic state­ment of anti-mo­nop­o­lism. Jack­son didn’t care whether or not the bank was do­ing a good job or whether it was well run; he didn’t care if the bank brought tremen­dous eco­nomic ben­e­fits to the coun­try. It was an un­war­ranted con­cen­tra­tion of eco­nomic power that had to be de­stroyed in or­der to pro­tect democ­racy it­self.</p>
    <p>Jack­son suc­ceeded, fin­ish­ing off what he called the “cor­rupt­ing mon­ster” in his sec­ond term. As a con­se­quence, the US would not get any­thing ap­prox­i­mat­ing the Bank of the United States un­til the cre­ation of the Fed­eral Re­serve in 1913.</p>
    <p>But a far greater chal­lenge awaited the anti-monopoly forces in the late 19th cen­tury. The rise of mas­sive pri­vate cor­po­ra­tions like Stan­dard Oil her­alded a new and un­set­tling kind of firm. They con­quered their com­peti­tors, then used their new­found mar­ket dom­i­nance to thwart fu­ture ones. Third par­ties rose up in re­sponse – from the Green­back­ers and the Pop­ulists to work­ing-class or­gan­i­sa­tions like the Knights of Labour. The move­ment also at­tracted many elites and busi­ness­men, par­tic­u­larly those who feared be­ing crushed by the new cor­po­rate com­bines.</p>
    <p>The cri­tique they of­fered did not fo­cus on the eco­nomic in­ef­fi­cien­cies and in­jus­tices cre­ated by these be­he­moths, much less the size of the firms. In­stead, their an­i­mus flowed from the con­vic­tion that con­cen­trated eco­nomic power could read­ily cor­rupt the po­lit­i­cal sys­tem it­self. This would ul­ti­mately yield an­titrust laws, first in state leg­is­la­tures and even­tu­ally on the fed­eral level with the pas­sage of the Sherman An­titrust Act.</p>
    <p>THE PUB­LIC IN­TER­EST</p>
    <p>As the fed­eral govern­ment be­gan to wield an­titrust law to chal­lenge Stan­dard Oil and oth­ers, some­thing sur­pris­ing hap­pened: The po­lit­i­cal di­men­sion of anti-mo­nop­o­lism be­gan to re­cede. In 1911, the Supreme Court ar­tic­u­lated what be­came known as the “Rule of Rea­son” doc­trine in the Stan­dard Oil case. It re­stricted the ap­pli­ca­tion of an­titrust law to cor­po­ra­tions that used il­le­git­i­mate meth­ods to achieve mar­ket dom­i­nance, which was more re­stric­tive and nar­rower than the anti-monopoly tra­di­tion from which it had sprung.</p>
    <p>Cor­po­ra­tions mind­ful of avoid­ing the wrath of anti-mo­nop­o­lists went to great lengths to prove that they served what be­came known as the “pub­lic in­ter­est”.</p>
    <p>But this frag­ile con­sen­sus fell apart in the 1970s and be­yond, as le­gal schol­ars like Richard Pos­ner and Robert Bork nar­rowed the mean­ing of an­titrust still fur­ther, ar­gu­ing that it should be in­voked only when there was clear dam­age done to con­sumers, not com­peti­tors. This in­ter­pre­ta­tion be­came en­trenched un­der pres­i­dent Ron­ald Rea­gan and con­tin­ues to hold sway.</p>
    <p>An­titrust suits against Big Tech could drag on for years in court and ul­ti­mately fail. But Face­book and Google shouldn’t ig­nore the pop­u­lar forces gath­er­ing power against them: Amer­i­cans have a long his­tory of view­ing mo­nop­o­lies as in­her­ently dan­ger­ous, no mat­ter what ben­e­fits they bring.</p>
