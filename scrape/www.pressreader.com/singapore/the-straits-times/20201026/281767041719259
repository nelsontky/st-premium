    <p>The ty­coon who be­came South Korea’s rich­est man af­ter trans­form­ing Sam­sung into a global tech ti­tan best known for its smart­phones, mem­ory chips and LED tele­vi­sions has died at the age of 78.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Kun-hee, who had been hos­pi­talised since suf­fer­ing a heart at­tack in 2014, died sur­rounded by his fam­ily, in­clud­ing his only son, com­pany vice-chair­man Lee Jaey­ong, Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Con­do­lences poured in from key politi­cians, while business lead­ers at­tended his wake at Sam­sung Med­i­cal Cen­tre in Gang­nam.</p>
    <p>South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in paid trib­ute to Mr Lee for grow­ing Sam­sung into a global brand with his “in­no­va­tive lead­er­ship” and mak­ing it a key driver of the coun­try’s eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, the third son of Sam­sung founder Lee Byung-chul, was widely con­sid­ered one of the most im­por­tant ar­chi­tects of South Korea’s post-war eco­nomic boom.</p>
    <p>Un­der him, Sam­sung grew from a small trad­ing firm to be the world’s largest man­u­fac­turer of smart­phones and mem­ory chips. With dozens of af­fil­i­ates rang­ing from con­struc­tion and ho­tel to in­sur­ance and fash­ion, the group con­trib­utes about 20 per cent of South Korea’s an­nual gross do­mes­tic prod­uct – the largest share by any chae­bol, or fam­ily-owned con­glom­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee was the coun­try’s rich­est and most pow­er­ful busi­ness­man with a net worth of US$20 bil­lion (S$27 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to Forbes.</p>
    <p>Born in Daegu, Mr Lee joined the fam­ily business in 1968 af­ter study­ing business at Ja­pan’s Waseda Univer­sity and Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton Univer­sity in the United States.</p>
    <p>He took con­trol of Sam­sung at the age of 45 in 1987 af­ter his fa­ther died. Sam­sung de­scribed him as a “true vi­sion­ary” whose trade­mark “New Man­age­ment” phi­los­o­phy an­nounced in 1993 was the “mo­ti­vat­ing driver of the com­pany’s vi­sion to de­liver the best tech­nol­ogy to help ad­vance global so­ci­ety”.</p>
    <p>At a time when Sam­sung was pro­duc­ing cheap, low-qual­ity prod­ucts for mass ex­port, he de­cided it was time to “change ev­ery­thing ex­cept your wife and chil­dren”.</p>
    <p>To drive home the mes­sage that Sam­sung would no longer tol­er­ate poor qual­ity, he or­dered 150,000 de­fec­tive phones to be burned and bull­dozed in 1995 in front of around 2,000 weep­ing em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>That paved the way for Sam­sung’s hugely pop­u­lar Any­call mo­bile phone model and marked the start of its rise to a global com­pany. That cor­po­rate trans­for­ma­tion will be re­mem­bered as Mr Lee’s big­gest legacy, said Pro­fes­sor Chang Sea­jin of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, who wrote the book Sony Vs Sam­sung: The In­side Story Of The Elec­tron­ics Giants’ Bat­tle For Global Supremacy.</p>
    <p>“No one could un­der­stand Mr Lee Kun-hee back then, when ev­ery­one was try­ing to sell in big vol­umes to in­crease rev­enue,” Prof Chang told The Straits Times. “But he changed the fo­cus from quan­tity to qual­ity, from poor ex­ports to branded prod­ucts. He is re­spon­si­ble for the Sam­sung that it is to­day.”</p>
    <p>Though known to be an in­spi­ra­tional leader, Mr Lee was reclu­sive and rarely gave in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>He had his fair share of scan­dals. In 1996, he was con­victed of brib­ing for­mer pres­i­dent Roh Tae-woo in re­turn for business favours, while in 2008 he was found guilty of em­bez­zle­ment and tax eva­sion in a slush fund scan­dal and forced to step down as chair­man.</p>
    <p>He got sus­pended sen­tences in both cases, and was even­tu­ally par­doned by sit­ting pres­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee was re­in­stated as chair­man of Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics in 2010 but suf­fered a heart at­tack in 2014 that kept him in hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>His son Jae-yong, groomed to take over from him, has been Sam­sung’s de facto leader since.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say the suc­ces­sion may face chal­lenges as the younger Mr Lee is fac­ing trial for un­fair trad­ing, stock ma­nip­u­la­tion and breach of trust in re­la­tion to a 2015 merger of two Sam­sung af­fil­i­ates in or­der to con­sol­i­date his con­trol.</p>
    <p>He had al­ready been jailed in 2017 over a graft case tied to im­peached for­mer pres­i­dent Park Geun-hye.</p>
    <p>The 51-year-old will also have to de­cide whether to in­herit his fa­ther’s stock as­sets worth about 18 tril­lion won (S$21.6 bil­lion), in­clud­ing a 4.18 per cent stake in Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics. If so, he would have to pay 10 tril­lion won in in­her­i­tance tax.</p>
    <p>Prof Chang said: “Lee Kun-hee was a very charis­matic leader and peo­ple fol­lowed his or­ders. Lee Jaey­ong doesn’t have that kind of charisma, and the in­dict­ment and cor­rup­tion cases make him look like a very weak leader.</p>
    <p>“Sam­sung is still very much a top-down, bu­reau­cratic com­pany, so whether he can take con­trol of Sam­sung is a big chal­lenge.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lee is also sur­vived by his wife and two daugh­ters, who run Sam­sung’s ho­tel business and wel­fare foun­da­tion. His fu­neral on Wed­nes­day will be a pri­vate fam­ily af­fair.</p>
    <p>Sam­sung said in a state­ment: “All of us... will cher­ish his mem­ory and are grate­ful for the jour­ney we shared with him.</p>
    <p>“His legacy will be ev­er­last­ing.”</p>
