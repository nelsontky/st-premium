    <p>HANOI • Storm Vamco bar­relled into Viet­nam yes­ter­day – dam­ag­ing build­ings and in­jur­ing at least five peo­ple – after leav­ing 67 dead in the Philip­pines. The storm made land­fall yes­ter­day morn­ing with re­ported winds of up to 90kmh, up­root­ing trees and blow­ing the roofs off houses and schools.</p>
    <p>Vamco is the lat­est in a se­ries of storms that have pum­melled Viet­nam over the past six weeks, caus­ing flood­ing and land­slides that have killed at least 159 peo­ple and left 70 oth­ers miss­ing.</p>
    <p>Ini­tial re­ports from the Disas­ter Man­age­ment Au­thor­ity yes­ter­day said that five peo­ple were in­jured while they were try­ing to se­cure their houses.</p>
    <p>Vamco has weak­ened since hit­ting the Philip­pines as a typhoon with winds of up to 155kmh, but state me­dia said it had still caused sig­nif­i­cant dam­age.</p>
    <p>Pic­tures showed seafront restau­rants in the tourist hot spot of Hoi An – a Unesco world her­itage site – ripped apart by the storm, and huge trees up­rooted in the old im­pe­rial city of Hue.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties had evac­u­ated nearly 650,000 peo­ple from seven coastal prov­inces to higher and safer ground be­fore the storm hit, but yes­ter­day warned of the dan­ger of land­slides trig­gered by the heavy rains.</p>
    <p>Weeks of se­vere weather have dam­aged or de­stroyed more than 400,000 homes in Viet­nam, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Red Cross and Red Cres­cent So­ci­eties. Roads and bridges have been washed away, power sup­plies dis­rupted, and cru­cial food crops de­stroyed, leav­ing at least 150,000 peo­ple at im­me­di­ate risk of food short­ages.</p>
    <p>Vamco was the dead­li­est storm to hit the Philip­pines this year, killing at least 67 peo­ple across the main is­land of Lu­zon in re­cent days and af­fect­ing some 1.7 mil­lion around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The storm also trig­gered some of the worst flood­ing in years, swamp­ing vil­lages, de­stroy­ing crops and leav­ing hun­dreds of thou­sands with­out power.</p>
    <p>Res­cue teams and emer­gency sup­plies in­clud­ing food were dis­patched to the north-east Philip­pines last Satur­day where swathes of the re­gion were in­un­dated. The sit­u­a­tion was made worse by the re­lease of wa­ter from a dam.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Leni Ro­bredo, who vis­ited Ca­gayan prov­ince, said yes­ter­day that the wa­ters were re­ced­ing, giv­ing hope that the worst might be over for the storm-bat­tered coun­try.</p>
    <p>“Sit­u­a­tion is so much bet­ter. Many ar­eas still flooded but wa­ter re­ceded al­ready,” she tweeted.</p>
    <p>Dam­age to agri­cul­tural com­modi­ties has been pegged at 1.2 bil­lion pe­sos (S$33 mil­lion), said disas­ter agency spokesman Mark Tim­bal.</p>
    <p>Vamco was the 21st cy­clone to hit the Philip­pines this year.</p>
    <p>It fol­lowed Su­per Typhoon Goni, the world’s most pow­er­ful storm this year, which brought heavy rain to south­ern Lu­zon prov­inces and killed scores of peo­ple.</p>
