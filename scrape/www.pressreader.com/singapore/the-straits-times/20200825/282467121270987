    <p>LON­DON • Get­ting close to the an­i­mated T-Rex at Lon­don’s Nat­u­ral His­tory Mu­seum nor­mally re­quires long queues and sharp el­bows.</p>
    <p>But to­day, only a hand­ful of chil­dren shriek in de­light as it roars.</p>
    <p>With tourists stay­ing away and visi­tor num­bers lim­ited due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the pop­u­lar ex­hibit is un­recog­nis­ably quiet – as are many of the Bri­tish cap­i­tal’s mu­se­ums and gal­leries.</p>
    <p>It is tough for the in­sti­tu­tions’ fi­nances, but the lack of crowds is a boon for the few for­eign vis­i­tors and for lo­cals, who are tak­ing the op­por­tu­nity to ex­plore their own back­yard.</p>
    <p>Ms Lynsey Wheel­don, 39, from Dun­sta­ble, north of Lon­don, headed straight to the di­nosaurs when she vis­ited the Nat­u­ral His­tory Mu­seum with her chil­dren on a hot Au­gust day.</p>
    <p>“We got in straight away and it was only us and maybe six or seven fam­i­lies,” she said. “We got to see things – it’s been great.”</p>
    <p>Still wor­ried about catch­ing the coro­n­avirus, she was re­as­sured by the de­ci­sion to let in just 20 per cent of nor­mal vis­i­tors.</p>
    <p>“We prob­a­bly wouldn’t have come if it wasn’t this quiet,” she said.</p>
    <p>For­eign vis­i­tors usu­ally make up 70 per cent of en­trants to the Nat­u­ral His­tory Mu­seum, but this has fallen to 3 per cent since it re­opened on Aug 5 – and 57 per cent were Lon­don­ers.</p>
    <p>For those tourists who do run the gaunt­let of Bri­tain’s rapidly chang­ing quar­an­tine rules, the calm in the city is also re­fresh­ing.</p>
    <p>“There isn’t the crush, there are no queues... for us tourists, it’s par­adise,” said French­man Michel Besse, who was vis­it­ing with his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>‘NO BUZZ’</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has been badly hit by the pan­demic, with more than 41,000 peo­ple dead, and de­spite the eas­ing of lock­down, many peo­ple are still ner­vous about ven­tur­ing out.</p>
    <p>As they slowly re­open, Lon­don’s tourist sites, mu­se­ums and gal­leries have made great ef­fort to show that they are safe.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors must pre-book timed tick­ets, some gal­leries have in­tro­duced one-way sys­tems, sani­tis­ing gel is on hand, and face masks are re­quired by law.</p>
    <p>Some ex­hibits con­sid­ered too risky are shut, from video in­stal­la­tions in small rooms to in­ter­ac­tive dis­plays.</p>
    <p>But in re­turn, a visi­tor can roam alone in the Vic­to­ria & Al­bert Mu­seum’s (V&A) Cast Courts, or linger in front of a Rubens paint­ing at the Na­tional Gallery with­out be­ing jos­tled.</p>
    <p>“It’s bril­liant. You can see things with­out loads of peo­ple barg­ing around,” said Lon­doner Jane Bar­nett, 62, dur­ing a visit to the Tate Mod­ern gallery of con­tem­po­rary art.</p>
    <p>Yet, as they looked over to the Mil­len­nium Bridge, the usual crowds thinned to barely a dozen peo­ple, her sis­ter Katie Clarke said it was a bit too quiet.</p>
    <p>“Walk­ing down the South Bank – there’s no buzz. It’s not Lon­don,” said the 55-year-old, who was vis­it­ing from out of town.</p>
    <p>At the Na­tional Gallery, in the near de­serted cafe over­look­ing a des­o­late Trafal­gar Square, Lon­doner Gavin Green, 63, said the lack of peo­ple was “a bit weird”.</p>
    <p>“They could prob­a­bly re­lax things a bit” and al­low more peo­ple in, his wife Kather­ine added.</p>
    <p>’EV­ERY­ONE NEEDS TO COME BACK’</p>
    <p>Like oth­ers roam­ing Lon­don’s mu­se­ums this sum­mer, the Greens are aware that the in­sti­tu­tions were hard hit by the lock­down and des­per­ately need vis­i­tors to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>The Tate gal­leries are plan­ning to axe 300 jobs in their shops and cafes af­ter di­rec­tor Maria Bal­shaw said she ex­pected only half as many vis­i­tors for the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>And His­toric Royal Palaces, which op­er­ates sites in­clud­ing the Tower of Lon­don and Hamp­ton Court Palace, has in­tro­duced a vol­un­tary re­dun­dancy scheme – in­clud­ing for the Tower’s fa­mous Beefeaters.</p>
    <p>Most mu­se­ums and gal­leries of­fer free en­try for the per­ma­nent dis­plays, but en­cour­age do­na­tions when book­ing a ticket – and the V&A has con­tact­less pay­ment points around the site.</p>
    <p>Mar­shalling her chil­dren to­wards another ex­hibit, Ms Wheel­don urged her fel­low Bri­tons to sup­port their cul­tural in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one needs to come back. It’s safe enough to come, and th­ese places can’t sur­vive if they don’t have vis­i­tors,” she said.</p>
