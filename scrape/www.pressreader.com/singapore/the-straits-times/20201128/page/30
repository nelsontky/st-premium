This induces an immune response, priming the immune system to attack the coronaviru­s if it later infects the body. 4 • Previous exposure to the vector could reduce effectiven­ess
• Relatively complex to manufactur­e It also contains the genetic code of a 2 that gives it its trademark spikes. Antibody This vaccine is made using a weakened version of the virus that causes the common cold in When the vaccine enters cells inside the body, it uses this genetic code to produce the surface spike protein of the coronaviru­s. 3 Spike protein genetic instructio­ns for the coronaviru­s’ “spike protein”. • COVID-19 VACCINES SECURED IN ASIA Inactivate­d virus RNA This uses genetic material from the disease-causing virus to stimulate an immune response against it. The virus is treated with heat, chemicals or radiation to inactivate it and prevent it from replicatin­g, but it can still trigger an immune response. • Messenger-RNA vaccines involve injecting snippets of the viral genetic code so a patient’s body mounts a protective response without being actually exposed to the whole virus. • This tried-and-tested technology uses a weakened form of the virus that, while unable to cause disease, spurs immune cells to make antibodies. PROS
• Strong cellular immunity
• Relatively easy to manufactur­e Example: Lunar-Cov19 vaccine co-developed by Duke-NUS Medical School and Arcturus Therapeuti­cs, as well as biotech companies CONS
• No RNA vaccines have been registered for commercial use • Booster shots may be required
• Some require ultra-cold storage CONS
• Low immunogeni­city, thereby requiring multiple boosters PROS
• A known technology considered safe
• Can be used in people with weakened immune systems Example: Vaccine candidates and Moderna. Sinopharm and Sinovac. IF A COVID-19 VACCINE WERE AVAILABLE, I’D GET IT Totally agree (Oct 2020) Country Type(s) of vaccines secured
Govt is working to secure a portfolio of vaccines A
AstraZenec­a, Sinopharm, Sinovac, a Covax deal AstraZenec­a
A
Covax deal to secure vaccines for 10 million people P Doses secured Doses needed* Estimated roll-out Viral vector The Oxford University-AstraZenec­a vaccine is made using a weakened version of the virus that causes the common cold in chimpanzee­s. ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine 1 The gene for a pathogen protein is inserted into a different virus (the vector) that can infect someone without causing disease. PROS
• Well-establishe­d technology
• Strong immune response Gene sequencing Sars CoV-2 spike protein Gene coding spike protein
