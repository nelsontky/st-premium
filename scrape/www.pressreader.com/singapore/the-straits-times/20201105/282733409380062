    <p>Artist Melissa Tan, 31, was out­side the Beauty World MRT sta­tion a few months ago when she saw a tile stick­ing out from an eroded path­way.</p>
    <p>In­trigued, she pock­eted it and just in time be­cause, a week later, the “de­sire path” where she was walk­ing – an in­for­mal path cut across the grass by the feet of pedes­tri­ans – was paved over with con­crete.</p>
    <p>Tan, who of­ten em­beds found frag­ments in her sculp­tures, be­lieves the mar­ble-like tile had been tossed out when the MRT build­ing was built a few years ago.</p>
    <p>For her, walks are im­por­tant be­cause they are of­ten when such serendip­i­tous dis­cov­er­ies oc­cur.</p>
    <p>Road frag­ments, con­struc­tion rub­ble and shards of glass col­lected dur­ing her walks will fea­ture in her ab­stract sculp­tures in The Dream From The Other Side (2020), a work-in-progress re­spond­ing to the chang­ing faces of three neigh­bour­hoods.</p>
    <p>The sculp­tures, which are made of epoxy resin, con­crete and other ma­te­ri­als, draw on topo­graph­i­cal maps of Wood­lands, Jurong and Tampines from 1958 and this year.</p>
    <p>She de­scribes the act of em­bed­ding found frag­ments as one of preser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>“I think of in­sects in am­ber. It’s al­ways interestin­g to see some­thing that is so­lid­i­fied, pre­served in that mo­ment in some sub­stance,” says Tan, who has a BA (Fine Arts) from Lasalle Col­lege of the Arts.</p>
    <p>Her sculp­tures can be viewed at Wood­lands Re­gional Li­brary till Dec 13 as part of the Sin­ga­pore Art Mu­seum’s Mini Mo­bile Mu­seum. The rov­ing ex­hi­bi­tion will sub­se­quently move to the Jurong and Tampines Re­gional Li­braries.</p>
    <p>Among her in­flu­ences are Bri­tish land artist Richard Long, known for A Line Made By Walk­ing (1967) where he cre­ated a line on a grassy field by re­peat­edly walk­ing back and forth in it; and Sin­ga­pore artist Deb­bie Ding, who spots civil engi­neer­ing marks on her walks and has col­lected them in an in­for­mal archive.</p>

    <p>The ab­stract sculp­tural works, such as this one from The Dream From The Other Side se­ries (2020, right), of artist Melissa Tan (pic­tured) fea­ture ob­jects she finds on her walks.</p>
