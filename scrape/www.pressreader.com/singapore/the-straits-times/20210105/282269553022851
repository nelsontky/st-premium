    <p>When hack­ers in­serted a ma­li­cious pro­gram into Texas-based So­larWinds’ pop­u­lar Orion IT man­age­ment tool as early as 2019 as a bridge­head for later at­tacks, they set off a chain re­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>It is lit­tle won­der that the hack, sus­pected to be linked to Rus­sia, is billed as the most men­ac­ing cy­ber at­tack in re­cent times.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have warned that it could take the whole of this year or longer for or­gan­i­sa­tions to de­ter­mine if back-door pro­grams have been planted in their sys­tems or if any data has been stolen.</p>
    <p>Based on ini­tial as­sess­ments, top govern­ment agen­cies in the United States and many For­tune 500 com­pa­nies – a to­tal of 18,000 or­gan­i­sa­tions – have al­ready been ex­posed to data theft as they had down­loaded soft­ware up­dates from So­larWinds be­tween March and June last year.</p>
    <p>As the So­larWinds tools are com­mon com­po­nents in many ven­dors’ prod­ucts, the hack in turn sub­jected larger sys­tems or net­works to cy­ber risks.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the hun­dreds of thou­sands of cus­tomers of US tech giants in­clud­ing Mi­crosoft, Cisco Sys­tems and FireEye – all of which have some So­larWinds soft­ware em­bed­ded in their prod­ucts – could have been ex­posed to cy­ber risks.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, FireEye works with telco Sing­tel to pro­vide cy­ber­se­cu­rity mon­i­tor­ing ser­vices to cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force also uses many mod­ules of So­larWinds’ Orion suite, in­clud­ing its net­work con­fig­u­ra­tion man­ager, which pro­vides ad­min­is­tra­tive ac­cess rights to all net­work equip­ment such as routers, switches, servers and com­put­ers con­nected to the net­work.</p>
