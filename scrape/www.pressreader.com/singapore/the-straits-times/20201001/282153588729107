    <p>There is a need to go back to the orig­i­nal core in­tent of Gill­man Bar­racks when it was first set up (Sul­li­van+Strumpf to move out of Gill­man Bar­racks, Sept 29).</p>
    <p>The clus­ter was con­cep­tu­alised as an art hub akin to Bei­jing’s fa­mous 798 Art Dis­trict, with in­ter­na­tional gal­leries fea­tur­ing top-notch artists and su­pe­rior pro­gram­ming.</p>
    <p>We should press on with the orig­i­nal in­tent and dou­ble down as fol­lows:</p>
    <p>• Trans­fer the man­age­ment of Gill­man Bar­racks to pri­vate en­trepreneur­s.</p>
    <p>• Re­vive fund­ing to the NTU Cen­tre for Con­tem­po­rary Art Sin­ga­pore, ex­tend its ten­ancy at the site, and ex­pand its scope to in­clude a larger com­mercial an­gle with cu­ra­tor Ute Meta Bauer in charge.</p>
    <p>Cre­ate a sense of ex­cite­ment or vi­brancy through night ac­tiv­i­ties and di­verse pro­gram­ming. Sin­ga­pore Art Week needs to in­cor­po­rate an in­ter­na­tional fair. Re­vi­talise Gill­man Bar­racks by quickly re­plac­ing the ten­ants that have left and se­cur­ing new gal­leries with a South-east Asian fo­cus and artist res­i­den­cies. Ap­point ad­vis­ers like art dealer Valen­tine Wil­lie or art col­lec­tor Chong Huai Seng, who have much knowl­edge and in­ter­na­tional ex­pe­ri­ence to share and im­part for the bet­ter­ment of the arts ecosys­tem.</p>
    <p>We are an im­por­tant player in the in­ter­na­tional art scene, and well placed to rep­re­sent South-east Asia, which is very likely to gain more promi­nence as a global art player in the post-Covid era.</p>
    <p>We need to do this ur­gently as we are an im­por­tant player in the in­ter­na­tional art scene, and well placed to rep­re­sent South-east Asia, which is very likely to gain more promi­nence as a global art player in the post-Covid era.</p>
