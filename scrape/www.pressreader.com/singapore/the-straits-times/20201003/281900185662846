    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, yes­ter­day re­turned to the na­tional palace af­ter com­plet­ing a se­ries of treat­ments at the Na­tional Heart In­sti­tute (IJN) in Kuala Lumpur, Ber­nama news agency quoted a palace of­fi­cial as say­ing.</p>
    <p>He was in hos­pi­tal for 12 days – from Sept 21 – first for food poi­son­ing and then sports-re­lated in­juries.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the King was ac­com­pa­nied by the Queen, Tunku Az­izah Ami­nah Maimu­nah, as they left for Is­tana Ne­gara at 12.40pm, the na­tional news agency re­ported.</p>
    <p>“Al­ham­dulil­lah (God be praised),</p>
    <p>His Majesty has re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>“Fol­low­ing the ad­vice of IJN’s spe­cial­ists, His Majesty would be rest­ing at Is­tana Ne­gara,” the palace’s Comptrolle­r of the Royal House­hold Ah­mad Fadli Sham­sud­din was quoted as say­ing.</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah’s move­ments and well-be­ing were closely mon­i­tored in the past week, as two days af­ter he was ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tal, op­po­si­tion chief An­war Ibrahim on Sept 23 called a news con­fer­ence to claim that he had se­cured de­fec­tions from fed­eral law­mak­ers to form a new gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war also claimed the ad­min­is­tra­tion of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin had “col­lapsed”. Mr An­war has so far re­fused to show his list of MPs who had de­fected, say­ing he would re­veal their names only af­ter an au­di­ence with the ruler.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion, the monarch can ap­point a prime min­is­ter whom he sees as likely to com­mand a ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He can also dis­solve Par­lia­ment and call for elec­tions on the ad­vice of the cur­rent prime min­is­ter, Tan Sri Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal drama in­volv­ing Mr An­war came just seven months af­ter an­other power strug­gle led to Mr Muhyid­din get­ting the premier­ship.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din, who has a ra­zor­thin ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment, has dis­missed Mr An­war’s claims of a ma­jor­ity and chal­lenged him to prove it through con­sti­tu­tional pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war heads the three-party Pakatan Hara­pan op­po­si­tion coali­tion, with a to­tal of 91 MPs. He needs at least 112 law­mak­ers on his side to claim a ma­jor­ity in the 222-seat Par­lia­ment.</p>
