    <p>• With in­juries a cause for con­cern for many clubs amid the fix­ture pile-up caused by the coron­avirus pan­demic, Mikel Arteta has joined the cho­rus of club man­agers ask­ing the Premier League to in­crease the num­ber of sub­sti­tutes they can use to five to re­duce player fa­tigue.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier last week, clubs in the English Foot­ball League (EFL) will now be per­mit­ted to make five sub­sti­tu­tions in matches.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the English top flight re­mains the only com­pe­ti­tion that has opted to stick with three sub­sti­tutes, in con­trast to the other “Big Five” Euro­pean leagues.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing the Premier League to show flex­i­bil­ity ahead of to­day’s game at Leeds, Arteta said: “We have to pro­tect (play­ers) as much as pos­si­ble, they are the pro­tag­o­nists in this in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“We have to mod­ify the rules and make them a lit­tle more flex­i­ble to give them a bet­ter op­por­tu­nity to be fit, phys­i­cally and men­tally. Let’s just do it, please.”</p>
    <p>The Gun­ners are short of op­tions in mid­field for their trip to El­land Road, with Mo­hamed El­neny cur­rently iso­lat­ing af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 last week, while £45 mil­lion (S$80.4 mil­lion) dead­line-day sign­ing Thomas Partey has yet to re­cover from a thigh in­jury that forced him off against As­ton Villa.</p>
    <p>On Partey, Arteta said: “We knew it was a sig­nif­i­cant in­jury. He’s done very well and he’s work­ing very hard, he wants to be avail­able.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, we can get him back soon, but it’s an area where we need to be care­ful and we need to be pro­tec­tive with the player.”</p>
    <p>There is also con­cern about fa­tigue for Bukayo Saka who played three times for England in seven days dur­ing the in­ter­na­tional break.</p>
    <p>“I have to see him to­day, how he’s look­ing and how he’s feel­ing. He’s a 19-year-old kid who has played a lot of foot­ball in the past few months,” Arteta said.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand from (England man­ager) Gareth South­gate’s point of view he had the in­jury of (Ben) Chilwell. He prob­a­bly didn’t plan to give him that many min­utes but the cir­cum­stances forced him to do it.”</p>
    <p>But in­juries and over­worked play­ers are not the only con­cern for Arteta. Wil­lian made an unau­tho­rised trip to Dubai dur­ing the break and has since been dis­ci­plined.</p>
    <p>Un­der Bri­tish coron­avirus re­stric­tions, in­ter­na­tional travel is not per­mit­ted ex­cept for lim­ited pur­poses such as work or ed­u­ca­tion, but the Brazil for­ward was pic­tured on In­sta­gram at the Nus­rEt steak­house with celebrity owner Nus­ret Gokce, more com­monly known as Salt Bae.</p>
    <p>As the United Arab Emi­rates is not on the UK’s quar­an­tine list, Wil­lian is in con­tention for the Leeds trip but Arteta said he made it clear his be­hav­iour was not wel­come.</p>
    <p>“What­ever hap­pens with things we don’t ex­pect, we will try to re­solve them in­ter­nally,” he said.</p>
    <p>On re­ports of a train­ing ground bust-up be­tween David Luiz and Dani Ce­bal­los that left the for­mer blood­ied ear­lier this week, Arteta added he would in­ves­ti­gate the source of the leak, warn­ing “there will be con­se­quences”.</p>
