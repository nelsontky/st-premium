    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son has said there was no ev­i­dence that Chi­nese-owned Tik­Tok had abused the data of its hun­dreds of mil­lions of users.</p>
    <p>“We have had a good look at this, and there is no ev­i­dence for us to sug­gest...that there is any mis­use of any peo­ple’s data,” he told the Aspen Se­cu­rity Fo­rum meet­ing in Aspen, Colorado, on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“There are plenty of things that are on Tik­Tok that are em­bar­rass­ing enough in pub­lic, but it’s that sort of so­cial me­dia de­vice,” he said via video­con­fer­ence, chuck­ling.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he said that Aus­tralians need to be “very aware” that Tik­Tok and other so­cial me­dia plat­forms, in­clud­ing United State­sowned firms, reap enor­mous amounts of in­for­ma­tion on users and sub­scribers.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence with Tik­Tok, he said, is “that in­for­ma­tion can be ac­cessed at a sov­er­eign state level”, a ref­er­ence to Chi­nese firms’ le­gal obli­ga­tion to share data with state in­tel­li­gence ser­vices if they want it.</p>
    <p>“But I think peo­ple should un­der­stand – and there’s a sort of buyer­be­ware process – there is noth­ing at this point that would sug­gest to us that se­cu­rity in­ter­ests have been com­pro­mised.”</p>
    <p>Cit­ing a na­tional se­cu­rity threat, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump on Mon­day gave Tik­Tok’s par­ent ByteDance six weeks to sell the app to an Amer­i­can firm or find it­self shut down.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said the US gov­ern­ment should get a “sub­stan­tial por­tion” of the sale price of Tik­Tok.</p>
    <p>Reuters re­ported last week that some in­vestors are valu­ing Tik­Tok at about US$50 bil­lion (S$68.4 bil­lion), cit­ing peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft is in talks with ByteDance, and any deal could in­clude Tik­Tok’s Aus­tralia busi­ness.</p>
    <p>But Mr Mor­ri­son down­played the im­me­di­ate threat.</p>
    <p>“There is no rea­son for us to re­strict those ap­pli­ca­tions at this point. We’ll ob­vi­ously keep watch­ing them.”</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, he stressed that peo­ple “need to un­der­stand where the ex­ten­sion cord goes back to”.</p>
    <p>THAT SORT OF SO­CIAL ME­DIA...</p>
    <p>There are plenty of things that are on Tik­Tok that are em­bar­rass­ing enough in pub­lic, but it’s that sort of so­cial me­dia de­vice.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
    <p>AUS­TRALIAN PRIME MIN­IS­TER SCOTT MOR­RI­SON, say­ing there was no ev­i­dence that Tik­Tok had abused the data of its users. “There is no rea­son for us to re­strict those ap­pli­ca­tions at this point,” he added.</p>
