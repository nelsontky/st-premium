    <p>De­spite a record surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and deaths, In­done­sia took a gam­ble last month to lift a par­tial lock­down and re­open its econ­omy.</p>
    <p>As the South-east Asian coun­try turns to key in­ter­na­tional part­ners to help ride out a cri­sis that has left mil­lions of peo­ple job­less and busi­nesses on the verge of col­lapse, China is poised to be the first coun­try to ben­e­fit from the less re­stric­tive mea­sures, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>Se­nior In­done­sian of­fi­cials had in­di­cated that eco­nomic re­cov­ery would be sped up by in­volv­ing more Chi­nese in­vest­ments in in­fra­struc­ture, as well as in in­dus­tries such as down­stream min­ing, en­ergy and man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Notwith­stand­ing pub­lic protests as fears over the virus rose, doors were flung open in April to wel­come hun­dreds of blue-collar Chi­nese work­ers to nickel smelter projects in South-east Su­lawesi prov­ince.</p>
    <p>These moves, how­ever, must not be mis­con­strued as favouritis­m, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>“De­spite ap­pear­ances, this is not a re­flec­tion that In­done­sia is pan­der­ing to China. In­done­sia is just open­ing its doors to the read­i­est in­vest­ment to help the coun­try avoid an eco­nomic down­turn,” said Mr Ach­mad Sukar­sono, a se­nior an­a­lyst at con­sul­tancy group Con­trol Risks.</p>
    <p>China is In­done­sia’s largest trading part­ner.</p>
    <p>From Jan­uary to April, trade vol­ume be­tween the two coun­tries reached US$24.1 bil­lion (S$33.5 bil­lion), only a 0.5 per cent dip from the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>China is also In­done­sia’s sec­ond-largest source of for­eign in­vest­ment, af­ter Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In the first quar­ter, China’s for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment in</p>
    <p>In­done­sia topped US$1.3 bil­lion, a 12 per cent rise com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese also ac­count for more than a third of the for­eign work­force in In­done­sia, and are among the coun­try’s big­gest sources of tourists – at around two mil­lion peo­ple a year.</p>
    <p>China has not been shy in mak­ing known its strong sup­port to­wards South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy of 270 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Am­bas­sador to In­done­sia Xiao Qian, in a post last Fri­day on the em­bassy’s web­site, said China has do­nated med­i­cal aid – in­clud­ing masks, test­ing reagents and ven­ti­la­tors – worth at least US$10 mil­lion to help In­done­sia fight the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>En­ter­prises in both coun­tries were en­cour­aged in the post to work to­gether to de­velop vac­cines, among other things.</p>
    <p>“Since the two coun­tries es­tab­lished diplo­matic re­la­tions seven decades ago, es­pe­cially over re­cent years, the ties be­tween the two sides have been brought to higher lev­els con­tin­u­ously with fields of co­op­er­a­tion ex­panded,” said the am­bas­sador in the post ti­tled Sol­i­dar­ity In A Time Of Ad­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>He added: “Fac­ing new op­por­tu­ni­ties in this new era, fur­ther de­vel­op­ment of China-In­done­sia friend­ship will make greater con­tri­bu­tion to peace and de­vel­op­ment in the re­gion and be­yond.”</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries have dis­cussed es­tab­lish­ing a fast lane for trav­ellers with im­me­di­ate needs as well as a green chan­nel for trans­porta­tion of cru­cial sup­plies, he said.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ments con­tinue to be pro­moted through on­line talks and video con­fer­ences, and Chi­nese en­ter­prises in In­done­sia have also adapted to mar­ket changes by pro­vid­ing on­line and door-to-door ser­vices to cus­tomers, he added.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say the In­done­sian gov­ern­ment, well aware of how its in­creas­ing de­pen­dence on the global eco­nomic gi­ant could stoke anti-Chi­nese sen­ti­ments at home as peo­ple fear they will lose their jobs to the Chi­nese, is tread­ing care­fully.</p>
    <p>Amid the trade ten­sions be­tween the US and China,</p>
    <p>Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Mar­itime and In­vest­ment Af­fairs Luhut Pand­jai­tan said in May that the sit­u­a­tion presents In­done­sia the op­por­tu­nity to make friends with any coun­try.</p>
    <p>“(Our re­la­tion­ship) with China is good, our re­la­tion­ship with the United States is also in its top con­di­tion,” he was quoted as say­ing by Tempo news web­site.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has set up a spe­cial task force to at­tract busi­nesses leav­ing China to re­lo­cate to In­done­sia, and a num­ber of Amer­i­can, Ja­panese and South Korean com­pa­nies have re­port­edly ex­pressed in­ter­est to do so.</p>
    <p>Mr Abra Talat­tov, an econ­o­mist at the Jakarta-based In­sti­tute for De­vel­op­ment of Eco­nom­ics and Fi­nance, told The Straits Times:</p>
    <p>“If In­done­sia ap­pears to be too close to China, other coun­tries will also put up re­sis­tance. The chal­lenge is for the In­done­sian gov­ern­ment to adopt a more pro­por­tional stance, and be fair to other in­vestors.”</p>
    <p>Al­though the on­go­ing pan­demic may pose more risks and un­cer­tain­ties for in­vestors than be­fore, the large cap­tive mar­ket that In­done­sia of­fers as well as a size­able labour pool, grow­ing mid­dle class and rich nat­u­ral re­sources re­main a draw.</p>
    <p>Mr Abra said: “So far In­done­sia is be­ing fair to all for­eign in­vestors. I don’t see any dis­crim­i­na­tion, and any­one who wants to in­vest here is wel­come to do so.”</p>
