    <p>ALEXAN­DER AL­BON,</p>
    <p>Red Bull driver, on how his third-placed fin­ish at the Tus­can Grand Prix last Sun­day can hope­fully in­spire more of his coun­try­men and Asians in gen­eral to take part in mo­tor sports.</p>
    <p>See­ing the Thai flag on the podium was a mo­ment to savour for Red Bull’s For­mula One driver Alexan­der Al­bon after his third-placed fin­ish at the Tus­can Grand Prix in Italy last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish-born Thai, mak­ing his­tory as the first driver from his coun­try to stand on an F1 podium, said in a Red Bull in­ter­view: “I’m proud to wave the flag for ev­ery­one in Thai­land that has been sup­port­ing me through­out my ca­reer.”</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old also hopes his achieve­ment can in­spire his com­pa­tri­ots and those in Asia to pur­sue a ca­reer in F1.</p>
    <p>He said: “It’s weird to think about, but I would love Thai peo­ple to see they can com­pete at the very top, not just as driv­ers, it’s also me­chan­ics, en­gi­neers, train­ers.</p>
    <p>“There are so many jobs you can do in F1 and it would be amaz­ing to see more Thai and Asian peo­ple in­ter­ested and tak­ing part in mo­tor sports.</p>
    <p>“I hope results like on Sun­day can pro­vide that in­spi­ra­tion.”</p>
    <p>Al­bon had come close to fin­ish­ing in the top three on two pre­vi­ous oc­ca­sions – at the Brazil­ian Grand Prix last sea­son and this year’s sea­son-open­ing race in Aus­tria – but two col­li­sions with Mercedes’ Lewis Hamil­ton shat­tered those dreams.</p>
    <p>This time, he en­dured a chaotic race at Mugello, over­tak­ing Re­nault’s Daniel Ricciardo late to fin­ish third be­hind six-time world cham­pion Hamil­ton and his Sil­ver Ar­rows team­mate Valt­teri Bot­tas.</p>
    <p>Al­bon said: “I would like to say it could have, and should have, hap­pened sooner, but to get it the way we did was nice. It wasn’t an easy race, we had to fight for it and it took some over­takes on the track to get it.”</p>
    <p>The feat was es­pe­cially sweet for the driver who has been un­der pres­sure re­cently. He has strug­gled in com­par­i­son to his team­mate Max Ver­stap­pen and there had been some spec­u­la­tion over whether Red Bull would drop him for Pierre Gasly, whom he re­placed for the Belgian Grand Prix last sea­son.</p>
    <p>So when Al­bon crossed the line on Sun­day, his first thoughts were of those who had been back­ing him: His fam­ily and his team.</p>
    <p>Al­bon, who fin­ished eighth in the driv­ers’ stand­ings last sea­son, paid trib­ute to his team for stick­ing with him over the team ra­dio after the race.</p>
    <p>“I just wanted to thank the guys for sup­port­ing me since day one. It’s been a long and dif­fi­cult year so far, even though things have been get­ting bet­ter, the results didn’t show that. I just wanted to say thanks to ev­ery­one,” said Al­bon, who is now fifth in the stand­ings on 63 points, be­hind Hamil­ton (190), Bot­tas (135), Ver­stap­pen (110) and McLaren’s Lando Nor­ris (65).</p>
    <p>He added: “The team have been work­ing hard try­ing to get the car in a bet­ter win­dow for me and make me feel com­fort­able. And of course, Monza wasn’t a good race for us, so to bounce back the way we did shows the courage and de­ter­mi­na­tion from ev­ery­one.”</p>
