    <p>Tom Cruise let rip over an ap­par­ent breach of Covid-19 safety pro­to­cols on the London set of the new Mis­sion: Im­pos­si­ble movie, telling crew mem­bers they would be fired if they did not obey t he rules, Bri­tain’s Sun news­pa­per re­ported on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In ex­ple­tive-filled re­marks cap­tured on au­dio tape ob­tained by The Sun, the star and pro­ducer of the ac­tion film yelled at the crew about lapses of so­cial dis­tanc­ing and other rules that al­low movies to be made dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A source close to the pro­duc­tion said the tape was au­then­tic. Cruise’s rep­re­sen­ta­tive de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>“I’m on the phone with ev­ery f***ing stu­dio at night, in­sur­ance com­pa­nies, pro­duc­ers and they’re look­ing at us and us­ing us to make their movies,” Cruise told the crew on the set.</p>
    <p>“Do you un­der­stand the re­spon­si­bil­ity that you have? Be­cause I will deal with your rea­son. And if you can’t be rea­son­able and I can’t deal with your logic, you’re fired,” he added, ac­cord­ing to the tape.</p>
    <p>The Sun did not say when the in­ci­dent took place, but the film­mak­ers ar­rived in London early this month.</p>
    <p>The sev­enth Mis­sion: Im­pos­si­ble was one of the first movies to shut down pro­duc­tion be­cause of the coro­n­avirus when it aban­doned film­ing in Venice, Italy, in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion re­sumed in Septem­ber, with film­ing in Italy, Nor­way and London. Cruise in July per­son­ally ap­pealed to Nor­way’s Prime Min­is­ter to shoot parts of the film in the coun­try un­der mod­i­fied quar­an­tine rules.</p>
    <p>The Paramount Pic­tures film is sched­uled to be re­leased in Novem­ber next year.</p>
    <p>Cruise told the crew that Hol­ly­wood was re­ly­ing on movies like Mis­sion: Im­pos­si­ble to keep the be­lea­guered in­dus­try go­ing.</p>
    <p>“We want the gold stan­dard. They’re back there in Hol­ly­wood mak­ing movies right now be­cause of us. Be­cause they be­lieve in us and what we’re do­ing,” he said, ac­cord­ing to the au­dio tape.</p>
    <p>Mis­sion: Im­pos­si­ble is one of the big­gest fran­chises in Hol­ly­wood, with 2018’s Mis­sion: Im­pos­si­ble – Fall­out tak­ing more than US$791 mil­lion (S$1.05 bil­lion) at the world­wide box of­fice.</p>
