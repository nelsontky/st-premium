    <p>In­di­vid­u­als who travel from Sin­ga­pore to Malaysia un­der the Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment (PCA) will have to be quar­an­tined in cen­tres des­ig­nated by the Malaysian gov­ern­ment if their des­ti­na­tion is be­yond the south­ern state of Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>This was an­nounced by Malaysia’s Health Min­is­ter Ad­ham Baba in a state­ment yes­ter­day. It came l ess than a week af­ter a 35-year-old man who had trav­elled from Sin­ga­pore tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new di­rec­tive, Sin­ga­pore­ans and re­turn­ing Malaysians are al­lowed to quar­an­tine at home or at any ac­com­mo­da­tion ar­ranged by their em­ployer as long as their home or place of em­ploy­ment is in Jo­hor. For those whose fi­nal des­ti­na­tion is be­yond Jo­hor, they must be quar­an­tined at gov­ern­ment-des­ig­nated cen­tres and this will be at the trav­eller’s own ex­pense, Dr Ad­ham said.</p>
    <p>The ex­emp­tion for PCA trav­ellers from un­der­go­ing Malaysia’s manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine for in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers re­mains.</p>
    <p>“Un­der this scheme (PCA), trav­ellers are ex­empted from go­ing through the manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine at gov­ern­ment-des­ig­nated cen­tres pro­vided that their Covid-19 PCR test taken within 24 hours of ar­riv­ing in Malaysia is neg­a­tive,” Dr Ad­ham said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents are re­quired to be in quar­an­tine for seven days but must regis­ter an­other neg­a­tive re­sult two days be­fore the pe­riod ends.</p>
    <p>The shorter pe­riod was ne­go­ti­ated by the two coun­tries ahead of the re­open­ing of their bor­ders un­der the PCA and Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane (RGL) ar­range­ments on Aug 17.</p>
    <p>Malaysian cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents are re­quired to be in quar­an­tine un­til they ob­tain a neg­a­tive test re­sult upon re­turn­ing home.</p>
    <p>Un­der the PCA, Malaysians and Sin­ga­pore­ans on a long-term so­cial visit pass are al­lowed to travel across the bor­der for two weeks to a month if they have stayed in the coun­try of their em­ploy­ment for the past three months.</p>
    <p>Un­der the RGL scheme, those re­sid­ing in Sin­ga­pore are al­lowed to en­ter Malaysia for a max­i­mum 14-day stay for of­fi­cial or busi­ness pur­poses. RGL ar­rivals are re­quired to be quar­an­tined at a de­clared ac­com­mo­da­tion un­til a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) neg­a­tive test re­sult is ob­tained.</p>
    <p>Malaysia recorded 62 new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, the high­est num­ber for a sin­gle day since it re­laxed its move­ment con­trol or­der in June. Most of the cases – 50 of them – were linked to a clus­ter that orig­i­nated from a district po­lice head­quar­ters in La­had Datu in Sabah, which is due to hold a state elec­tion later this month.</p>
    <p>Un­der the new di­rec­tive, Sin­ga­pore­ans and re­turn­ing Malaysians are al­lowed to quar­an­tine at home or at any ac­com­mo­da­tion ar­ranged by their em­ployer as long as their home or place of em­ploy­ment is in Jo­hor. For those whose fi­nal des­ti­na­tion is be­yond Jo­hor, they must be quar­an­tined at gov­ern­ment-des­ig­nated cen­tres and this will be at the trav­eller’s own ex­pense, Dr Ad­ham said.</p>
