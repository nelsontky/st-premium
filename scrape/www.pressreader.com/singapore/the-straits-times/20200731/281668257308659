    <p>A to­tal of 17 town coun­cils have been formed fol­low­ing the re­cent gen­eral elec­tion, with the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) run­ning 15 of them.</p>
    <p>The new­comer among the 17 is Sengkang Town Coun­cil (SKTC), which will be run by the Work­ers’ Party (WP).</p>
    <p>Of the rest, 11 are re­con­sti­tuted with changes in bound­aries and five with un­changed town ar­eas, the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry, which over­sees town coun­cils, is­sued an or­der un­der the Town Coun­cils Act to put into ef­fect the for­ma­tion of the town coun­cils fol­low­ing re­quests from MPs of the con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>The 11 re­con­sti­tuted town coun­cils are Ang Mo Kio, Bis­han-Toa Payoh, Chua Chu Kang, Jalan Be­sar, Marine Pa­rade, Mar­sil­ing-Yew Tee, Nee Soon, Pasir Ris-Pung­gol, Sem­bawang, Tampines and West Coast.</p>
    <p>The five that re­tained their bound­aries are Alju­nied-Hougang, East Coast-Feng­shan, Hol­land-Bukit Pan­jang, Jurong-Cle­menti and Tan­jong Pa­gar.</p>
    <p>The East Coast-Feng­shan Town Coun­cil has been re­named East Coast Town Coun­cil, after the for­mer Feng­shan SMC was ab­sorbed into East Coast GRC.</p>
    <p>The new SKTC will man­age Sengkang GRC, which was cre­ated from parts of the pre-GE2020 Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC, Pung­gol East SMC and Sengkang West SMC, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>The An­chor­vale ward in the new Sengkang GRC is now be­ing man­aged by Ang Mo Kio Town Coun­cil (AMKTC), while the Pung­gol East and Sengkang Cen­tral ar­eas are over­seen by the Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil (PRPTC).</p>
    <p>Un­der the law, town coun­cils have up to 90 days from the date of the or­der to take over the man­age­ment of trans­ferred ar­eas.</p>
    <p>This means that SKTC and the 11 re­con­sti­tuted town coun­cils will have to do it by Oct 28 but they can also mu­tu­ally agree to an ear­lier date, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>WP’s Sengkang team leader He Ting Ru, who led a four-per­son team to vic­tory in the July 10 polls with 52.1 per cent of the votes, will chair the new town coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Ms He had said on July 19 that her town coun­cil has reached out to AMKTC and PRPTC to dis­cuss the han­dover.</p>
    <p>Two days later, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State Janil Puthuc­heary, a Pasir RisPung­gol GRC MP, said both town coun­cils run by the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) have started hand­ing town coun­cil doc­u­ments to the SKTC.</p>
    <p>Dr Janil also said the two PAP town coun­cils will work to­gether to make sure the tran­si­tion to SKTC is smooth.</p>
    <p>The han­dover of du­ties will also see the SKTC tak­ing over the man­age­ment of a law­suit ini­ti­ated by the PRPTC.</p>
    <p>PRPTC had filed the civil suit, which is on­go­ing, to re­cover al­leged</p>
    <p>Hari Raya Haji com­mem­o­rates Prophet Ibrahim’s trust in God, who had asked him to sac­ri­fice his son. The boy’s life was spared and a ram was slaugh­tered in­stead.</p>
    <p>Mus­lims mark the day with prayers and the ko­r­ban rit­ual, which in­volves slaugh­ter­ing live­stock and dis­tribut­ing the meat to the poor.</p>
    <p>This year, the ko­r­ban will not take place in Sin­ga­pore. In­stead, the slaugh­ter is per­formed in Aus­tralia, and the meat will be chilled and shipped over. Tra­di­tion­ally, onethird goes to the per­son spon­sor­ing the an­i­mal, one-third to fam­ily, friends and neigh­bours, and the rest to the poor.</p>
    <p>While 65 mosques will be open for Hari Raya Haji prayers this morn­ing, only a to­tal of 8,750 wor­ship­pers will be able to at­tend. Most will losses in­curred by the for­mer Pung­gol East SMC, which is now part of Sengkang GRC and re­turned to WP hands at the re­cent polls.</p>
    <p>This means the WP team in Sengkang will take on the re­spon­si­bil­ity of han­dling the law­suit, which was brought by PRPTC against WP chair­man Sylvia Lim, for­mer party chief Low Thia Khi­ang and six other de­fen­dants in the High Court.</p>
    <p>Be­sides SKTC, the WP also man­ages the Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>As for the PAP’s town coun­cils, four new SMCs carved out be­fore the elec­tion will join neigh­bour­ing town coun­cils: Ke­bun Baru and Yio Chu Kang SMCs will be part of AMKTC, while the Bis­han-Toa Payoh Town Coun­cil will also serve Mary­mount SMC. Pung­gol West SMC will come un­der PRPTC.</p>
    <p>Dr Teo Ho Pin, a for­mer Bukit Pan­jang MP, was the co­or­di­nat­ing chair­man of the 15 PAP town coun­cils be­fore the elec­tion. He has since re­tired as an MP.</p>
    <p>A PAP spokesman said the role of co­or­di­nat­ing chair­man of PAP town coun­cils will be de­cided at a later date, once all the town coun­cil chair­men have been ap­pointed.</p>
    <p>She did not spec­ify any time­frame for it. hold three ses­sions, with no more than 50 wor­ship­pers – who had to book slots on­line – each time.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) re­minded Mus­lims to con­tinue to abide by na­tional re­stric­tions on gath­er­ings in pub­lic and pri­vate.</p>
    <p>They should limit so­cial gath­er­ings to not more than five peo­ple, and house­holds should re­ceive no more than five vis­i­tors at one time. Vis­i­tors to the ceme­tery should re­mem­ber to wear masks and main­tain safe dis­tanc­ing of at least 1m.</p>
    <p>Muis said: “In our ea­ger­ness to cel­e­brate this spe­cial oc­ca­sion with our loved ones, let us con­tinue to be so­cially re­spon­si­ble and stay vig­i­lant to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19.</p>
