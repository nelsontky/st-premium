    <p>The food and bev­er­age (F&B) sec­tor is on a path of steady re­cov­ery, with many com­pa­nies see­ing their rev­enues back to around 70 per cent to 80 per cent of preCovid-19 sales.</p>
    <p>A big driver of this re­cov­ery is from com­pa­nies that em­braced dig­i­tal adop­tion, Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing said yes­ter­day dur­ing a visit to Swee Choon Tim Sum Restau­rant.</p>
    <p>He noted that more restau­rants and eater­ies have turned to sell­ing food and bev­er­ages on­line even af­ter Sin­ga­pore lifted the cir­cuit breaker in June.</p>
    <p>Of the to­tal in­dus­try sales in the food ser­vices sec­tor, nearly 45 per cent was made on­line in May when the cir­cuit breaker was in place – up from roughly 10 per cent in Jan­uary. By Septem­ber, about one in five sales was made on­line – higher than pre-cir­cuit breaker lev­els.</p>
    <p>The food ser­vices sec­tor con­trib</p>
    <p>utes about 1.1 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and em­ploys about 5.5 per cent of the coun­try’s work­force.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated dig­i­tal adop­tion for many of our F&B com­pa­nies,” Mr Chan said yes­ter­day. This is es­pe­cially so for those in the Cen­tral Busi­ness District and tourism-re­lated ar­eas, as well as cater­ing com­pa­nies, all of which are see­ing slower re­cov­ery, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan noted that from Jan­uary to Oc­to­ber, the num­ber of ap­pli­ca­tions for the Pro­duc­tiv­ity So­lu­tions Grant (PSG) in the F&B sec­tor was more than four times that of the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>So far, more than 2,700 PSG ap­pli­ca­tions for IT so­lu­tions have been ap­proved this year.</p>
    <p>Swee Choon is an ex­am­ple of an F&B com­pany that adapted quickly dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker by piv­ot­ing to food de­liv­ery ser­vices to min­imise the im­pact of Covid-19 on its busi­ness, said the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ef­forts in­creased its sales from food de­liv­ery sig­nif­i­cantly, from less than 1 per cent be­fore the cir­cuit breaker to around 60 per cent of its av­er­age monthly rev­enue dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>Even as din­ing in re­sumed, sales from food de­liv­ery con­tinue to con­trib­ute about 25 per cent to 30 per cent of Swee Choon’s monthly rev­enue, he added.</p>
    <p>With the in­creased rev­enue from food de­liv­ery sales, Swee Choon has boosted its over­all rev­enue to pre-Covid-19 lev­els de­spite seat­ing ca­pac­ity re­stric­tions due to safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“So now, they have two en­gines to climb, com­pared to in the past, where they were just phys­i­cally con­strained to the six shop­houses in Jalan Be­sar,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to sup­port F&B play­ers with var­i­ous ini­tia­tives to help them adopt dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, com­pa­nies can get dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing sup­port through the En­ter­prise De­vel­op­ment Grant or sign up for sub­sidised dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous ini­tia­tives un­der the SMEs Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme also help com­pa­nies use dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies, such as the Dig­i­tal Re­silience Bonus, where F&B firms can get bonus pay­outs of up to $10,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan also en­cour­aged com­pa­nies to test new busi­ness mod­els to cap­ture growth op­por­tu­ni­ties. He noted how cater­ing com­pany Le</p>
    <p>Rain­bow is part­ner­ing with the Food In­no­va­tion and Re­source Cen­tre – a joint ini­tia­tive be­tween Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) – to de­velop ready-to-eat prod­ucts to in­crease its rev­enue streams, given the re­stric­tions on buf­fets.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies can also take ad­van­tage of FoodIn­no­vate, a mul­ti­a­gency ini­tia­tive led by ESG that helps Sin­ga­pore food com­pa­nies to drive food tech­nol­ogy and in­no­va­tions, he said.</p>
    <p>As com­pa­nies dig­i­talise and au­to­mate their pro­cesses, there are op­por­tu­ni­ties to re­design jobs to make work­ing in the sec­tor more at­trac­tive to lo­cals and re­duce its re­liance on for­eign man­power, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>As of the mid­dle of last month, more than 1,100 work­ers from over 30 F&B com­pa­nies have un­der­gone or are un­der­go­ing reskilling through Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s Job Re­design Reskilling Pro­gramme for Food Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies can also get course fee sub­si­dies and ab­sen­tee pay­roll for some cour­ses through Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore’s En­hanced Train­ing Sup­port Pack­age for the food ser­vices sec­tor, he added.</p>
