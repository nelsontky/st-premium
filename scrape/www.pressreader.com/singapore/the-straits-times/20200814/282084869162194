    <p>MANILA • Prop­erty de­vel­op­ers in the Philip­pines are con­sid­er­ing novel al­ter­na­tive uses for malls as peo­ple stay home and pre­fer to buy things on­line.</p>
    <p>SM Prime Hold­ings, the na­tion’s big­gest land­lord, is l eas­ing out some of its park­ing spa­ces for longer-term car stor­age, while a unit of Ayala Land plans to con­vert ar­eas in its shop­ping cen­tres to ecom­merce back-end fa­cil­i­ties and med­i­cal clin­ics.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines’ coro­n­avirus out­break, the worst in South-east Asia, has made Filipinos fear­ful of go­ing about their daily busi­ness as they seek to avoid high-traf­fic spots.</p>
    <p>That is putting ex­tra pres­sure on re­tail land­lords al­ready weath­er­ing a slump in de­mand and a re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines is home to some of Asia’s big­gest malls – cap­i­tal Manila and its sur­round­ings boast to­tal re­tail space of 7.3 mil­lion sq m, ac­cord­ing to Col­liers In­ter­na­tional Group re­search man­ager Joey Bondoc. That is more than twice the size of New York’s Cen­tral Park.</p>
    <p>Re­tail va­cancy rates in Manila are fore­cast to climb to 12 per cent this year, while rents will drop for the first time since the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, forc­ing shop­ping cen­tres to ei­ther “in­no­vate or evap­o­rate”, said Mr Bondoc.</p>
    <p>AyalaLand Lo­gis­tics Hold­ings is study­ing turn­ing parts of its malls into last-mile ful­fil­ment fa­cil­i­ties, ac­cord­ing to a doc­u­ment seen by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>“We con­tinue to ex­plore op­por­tu­ni­ties,” said Mr Fran­cis Mon­tojo, the unit’s chief fi­nance of­fi­cer, ad­ding that other com­mer­cial ar­eas may be con­verted into health­care clin­ics or of­fice space.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, SM Prime has leased out a floor in the carpark of a mall to a bank, as well as an­other floor in an of­fice tower, pres­i­dent Jef­frey Lim said in a text mes­sage.</p>
    <p>AyalaLand Lo­gis­tics shares fell as much as 2.3 per cent in Manila trad­ing yesterday, head­ing for a three­day los­ing streak. The bench­mark Philippine Stock Ex­change In­dex rose 0.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Re­tail de­vel­op­ers must look at pos­si­ble ar­eas to pivot and re­pur­pose space,” said Mr Kash Sal­vador, an as­so­ciate direc­tor at prop­erty ser­vices com­pany San­tos Knight Frank. “We see an op­por­tu­nity in stor­age and ware­hous­ing given higher lo­gis­tics de­mand as shop­pers go on­line.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bondoc said mall own­ers should also con­sider leas­ing va­cant space to co-work­ing com­pa­nies as busi­nesses seek smaller of­fices in var­i­ous lo­ca­tions.</p>
