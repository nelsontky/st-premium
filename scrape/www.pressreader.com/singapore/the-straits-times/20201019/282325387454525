    <p>Barcelona and Real Madrid will go into Satur­day’s Cla­sico at the Nou Camp know­ing im­prove­ments are manda­tory.</p>
    <p>Barcelona fell to their first La Liga de­feat un­der Ron­ald Koe­man as they lost 1-0 at Getafe on Satur­day, hours af­ter league cham­pi­ons Real Madrid slipped to a shock 1-0 home de­feat by pro­moted Cadiz.</p>
    <p>It was the first time the two giants of Span­ish foot­ball had both lost league matches on the same day with­out scor­ing since May 6, 2000.</p>
    <p>Getafe for­ward Jaime Mata sent goal­keeper Neto the wrong way from the penalty spot in the 56th minute af­ter mid­fielder Frenkie de Jong had been pe­nalised for tread­ing on Djene Dakonam’s foot.</p>
    <p>The re­sult left Barca ninth with seven points af­ter four games while Madrid re­main top on 10 points hav­ing played five matches.</p>
    <p>“We have not en­tered the game in the sec­ond half,” Koe­man, whose side play Ferenc­varos in the Cham­pi­ons League to­mor­row, told Marca. “We lost the ball too much and con­ceded dan­ger­ous at­tack­ing sit­u­a­tions. I don’t know if it was a de­served penalty but I felt the penalty was sought out and we suf­fered.</p>
    <p>“We cre­ated very few chances, the best of them in the first half. It has been a very dis­puted game and we had lit­tle end prod­uct.”</p>
    <p>Koe­man made a num­ber of changes to the Barca side who had drawn 0-0 at home to Sevilla in their last game, hand­ing first starts of the term to new ar­rival Sergino Dest, Pedri and Ous­mane Dem­bele.</p>
    <p>Koe­man also played An­toine Griez­mann in his pre­ferred cen­tral role af­ter his com­plaints about play­ing out of po­si­tion. Yet the striker missed a glo­ri­ous chance early in the game, blast­ing over the bar to re­main with­out a goal af­ter four league starts this sea­son. He has just two goals from his last 28 shots.</p>
    <p>Madrid coach Zine­dine Zi­dane will also seek to get more out of his play­ers af­ter ad­mit­ting his team could have been two or three goals down be­fore half-time.</p>
    <p>An­thony Lozano gave Cadiz the lead early in the game af­ter the vis­i­tors had missed four chances in a chaotic start from the hosts, while he also wasted a clear op­por­tu­nity to dou­ble his side’s lead.</p>
    <p>“They played with more pace than us, more en­thu­si­asm. We can’t make any ex­cuses, we played a bad game. We have to con­grat­u­late Cadiz. We’re not happy at all,” Zi­dane said.</p>
    <p>Madrid had not lost in the league since a 2-1 de­feat by Real Betis back in March, just be­fore last sea­son’s com­pe­ti­tion was halted due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and their last home de­feat came in May 2019, a 2-0 loss to Betis.</p>
    <p>Real goal­keeper Thibaut Cour­tois, how­ever, in­sisted “a de­feat is al­ways a good thing be­cause it gives you a wake-up call”.</p>
    <p>“We’ll have to put in a good per­for­mance against Shakhtar (Donetsk in the Cham­pi­ons League), win the match and head to the Nou Camp in con­fi­dent mood,” he added.</p>
