    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) has as­sessed that Mustafa Cen­tre’s cost-cut­ting mea­sures, which in­clude send­ing back for­eign work­ers whose work per­mits have ex­pired, are be­ing im­ple­mented fairly. MOM’s spokesman said the com­pany had no­ti­fied the min­istry of its mea­sures as early as March, when the Covid-19 out­break was start­ing to gain mo­men­tum here.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) has as­sessed that Mustafa Cen­tre’s cost-cut­ting mea­sures, which in­clude send­ing back for­eign work­ers whose work per­mits have ex­pired, are be­ing im­ple­mented fairly.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it is in touch with the com­pany and the Sin­ga­pore Man­ual and Mer­can­tile Work­ers’ Union on the re­cent mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“We note that the com­pany ob­tained its union’s sup­port on the cost-sav­ing mea­sures in view of the poor busi­ness sit­u­a­tion,” an MOM spokesman told The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The spokesman added that the min­istry will con­tinue to en­sure that any fur­ther mea­sures will be im­ple­mented fairly and rea­son­ably.</p>
    <p>The pop­u­lar shop­ping land­mark was in the news last week af­ter its founder told staff that the com­pany was un­able to re­new the work passes of its for­eign work­ers, and would pay for their plane tick­ets home and one month’s ba­sic salary.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter, founder and man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Mus­taq Ah­mad also urged staff who have not been called upon for work to take on a sec­ond job, and said the com­pany will dis­con­tinue their sus­te­nance al­lowance to re­duce pay­roll costs.</p>
    <p>MOM’s spokesman said the com­pany had no­ti­fied the min­istry of its mea­sures as early as March, when the Covid-19 out­break was start­ing to gain mo­men­tum here.</p>
    <p>The com­pany had also de­clared to MOM that all gov­ern­ment sup­port re­ceived had been passed on to its em­ploy­ees, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>But Mr Mus­taq said in his let­ter that busi­ness had been badly af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The mall closed on April 2 af­ter it was linked to more than 100 Covid-19 cases, and is be­lieved to be the start­ing point of thou­sands of in­fec­tions in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Af­ter it re­opened par­tially i n May, it had to re­duce its op­er­at­ing hours and im­pose strict safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mustafa em­ploy­ees told ST last week that busi­ness is still far be­low pre-pan­demic lev­els. Some em­ploy­ees have man­aged to find tem­po­rary jobs as they wait to be called back to work.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­hamed Bhu­rari, 42, said he stopped work in April when his de­part­ment, Mustafa Air Travel, closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. He said his boss had warned him that it might re­open only next year.</p>
    <p>He has started work­ing with a cargo com­pany. “We un­der­stand that they (the travel agency) can­not open, so we have to wait. Hope­fully, we will go back soon,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mustafa em­ploy­ees also said that some of them are cur­rently ros­tered for work on a ro­tat­ing ba­sis.</p>
    <p>An em­ployee who de­clined to be named said his su­per­vi­sor had told him to take a break from this month. He would have to wait for his turn to be called back to work, said the em­ployee.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just me, ev­ery­one is fac­ing the same thing,” said the work per­mit holder, who is now on the look­out for a new job.</p>
    <p>A Mustafa Cen­tre spokesman said the com­pany is still work­ing out the ex­act num­ber of work­ers who will be af­fected by the cost-cut­ting mea­sures. The spokesman also added that it is work­ing with the union on tem­po­rary de­ploy­ments for af­fected staff.</p>
