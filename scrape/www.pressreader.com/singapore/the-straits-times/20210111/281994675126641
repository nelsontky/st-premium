    <p>I ap­plaud the Na­tional Parks Board’s ef­forts in build­ing the ex­ten­sive park con­nec­tor net­work (PCN) and neigh­bour­hood parks across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>They pro­vide a great way for the public to keep fit and en­joy our green spa­ces through running, walk­ing or cy­cling.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ma­jor­ity of PCN routes are made ei­ther of con­crete or as­phalt, which are not the most ideal sur­faces for running.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to many stud­ies, these hard sur­faces cause more stress on the feet and legs com­pared with softer sur­faces such as grass or rub­ber, thereby in­creas­ing in­jury risk.</p>
    <p>Health sur­veys have shown Sin­ga­pore­ans are in­creas­ingly ex­pe­ri­enc­ing problems with their joints.</p>
    <p>I also fre­quently see peo­ple sport­ing knee guards and sports tape while out on their jogs.</p>
    <p>The lack of softer running sur­faces in Sin­ga­pore may be con­tribut­ing to the preva­lence of such in­juries.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties would do well to in­cor­po­rate softer ma­te­ri­als such as dirt, like what is be­ing done at Be­dok and MacRitchie Reser­voirs, or even rub­ber, into more PCN and park routes.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the public would be able to stay health­ier while keep­ing fit and ap­pre­ci­at­ing our Gar­den City.</p>
    <p>We would also save more on health­care costs – knee re­place­ments aren’t cheap! Ti­mothy Ang Li-Yang</p>
