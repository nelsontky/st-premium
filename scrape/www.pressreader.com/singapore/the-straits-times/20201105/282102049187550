    <p>Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam yes­ter­day said he is pre­pared to rec­om­mend a com­mis­sion of in­quiry (COI) into the Parti Liyani case, but added that he had “heard noth­ing” to jus­tify one.</p>
    <p>In con­clud­ing his min­is­te­rial state­ment, he had chal­lenged NonCon­stituency MP (NCMP) Leong Mun Wai to spec­ify the is­sues that he felt war­ranted a high-level in­de­pen­dent in­quiry into the case.</p>
    <p>This sparked two sep­a­rate ex­changes that ended with the Progress Sin­ga­pore Party NCMP with­draw­ing his call for a COI.</p>
    <p>In re­spond­ing to Mr Leong’s par­lia­men­tary ques­tion on the mat­ter, Mr Shan­mugam said a COI is a “se­ri­ous mat­ter” that will take up a lot of time and re­sources.</p>
    <p>He noted that the po­lice of­fi­cers and prosecutor­s in­volved in the case did not face any im­proper pres­sure, and a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal will look into complaints against the prosecutor­s from the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter asked Mr Leong to spec­ify “what part of this mat­ter con­tin­ues to rea­son­ably make him be­lieve and ques­tion that un­due in­flu­ence was used by the Liews”, re­fer­ring to the fam­ily of Ms Parti’s for­mer em­ployer Liew Mun Leong.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Mr Leong main­tained the need for an in­de­pen­dent in­quiry to have “more dis­cus­sion” on the mat­ter and look into “sys­temic as­pects of the whole crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem”.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam replied: “It’s not a ques­tion of mak­ing some broad and vague state­ments... (Do) we have a com­mis­sion of in­quiry on the en­tire law, the po­lice and en­force­ment sys­tem? Is that even imag­in­able? So can we please have some clar­ity on what is it that con­cerns you?”</p>
    <p>Mr Leong then ques­tioned the five-week gap be­tween the fil­ing of the po­lice re­port by Mr Liew and the po­lice of­fi­cers vis­it­ing the scene, and said Mr Shan­mugam’s in­ter­pre­ta­tion of the Liews’ be­hav­iour, with re­gards to Ms Parti, could be fur­ther in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said “the po­lice do not in any way seek to de­fend” the five-week gap, and that the is­sue of mo­tive “can­not prop­erly” be the ob­ject of a COI.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong then said he would with­draw his call for a COI.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter replied: “Let me put it on record: I have no prob­lem rec­om­mend­ing such a com­mis­sion of in­quiry. We have noth­ing to hide. But in law, they will say (this is) Mi­caw­berism.”</p>
    <p>Mi­caw­berism is a ref­er­ence to the feck­less op­ti­mism dis­played by Wilkins Mi­caw­ber, a char­ac­ter in the Charles Dick­ens novel David Cop­per­field.</p>
    <p>“So far, we have heard noth­ing that I can ra­tio­nally put to­gether to jus­tify a com­mis­sion of in­quiry,” said Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong later re­peated his call for a COI in his speech on a mo­tion moved by Work­ers’ Party chair­man Sylvia Lim (Alju­nied GRC) about the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>This trig­gered a sec­ond ex­change with Mr Shan­mugam, who pressed Mr Leong to spec­ify the ba­sis for a COI.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong again raised what he called “sys­temic” faults ex­posed by the case, this time ask­ing why checks had failed at each stage of the process.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam re­it­er­ated that dis­ci­plinary pro­ceed­ings were un­der way, and asked Mr Leong to clar­ify if he was sug­gest­ing an el­e­ment of im­proper in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>The NCMP said he was not. In that case, there was no ba­sis for a com­mis­sion of in­quiry, the min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong then con­ceded the point again. “We thought the sys­temic faults alone were enough to be a ba­sis for the in­quiry, but after your ex­pla­na­tion, we are pre­pared to ac­cept that you had done a thor­ough in­ves­ti­ga­tion of the sit­u­a­tion al­ready. Then we’ll with­draw our pro­posal for the in­quiry.”</p>

    <p>Let me put it on record: I have no prob­lem rec­om­mend­ing such a com­mis­sion of in­quiry. We have noth­ing to hide. But in law, they will say (this is) Mi­caw­berism. So far, we have heard noth­ing that I can ra­tio­nally put to­gether to jus­tify a com­mis­sion of in­quiry.</p>
    <p>LAW MIN­IS­TER K. SHAN­MUGAM, after Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai said he would with­draw his call for a COI. Mi­caw­berism is a ref­er­ence to the feck­less op­ti­mism dis­played by Wilkins Mi­caw­ber, a char­ac­ter in the Charles Dick­ens novel David Cop­per­field.</p>
