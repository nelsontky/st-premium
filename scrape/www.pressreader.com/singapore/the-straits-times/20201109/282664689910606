    <p>Given how per­va­sive mo­bile de­vices are in homes these days, it is not sur­pris­ing that more par­ents are us­ing e-books to en­gage their young chil­dren.</p>
    <p>There is a lot to be said in favour of e-books. They are por­ta­ble and the text is sup­ple­mented with colour­ful an­i­ma­tion and au­dio that seem to cap­ture the at­ten­tion of young chil­dren.</p>
    <p>But sev­eral stud­ies into read­ing show that printed books are far bet­ter at de­vel­op­ing lan­guage skills among chil­dren, apart from hon­ing their rea­son­ing and think­ing abil­i­ties. These ben­e­fits flow nat­u­rally when a child gets im­mersed in read­ing at a young age.</p>
    <p>One of the most in­ter­est­ing pieces of re­search in this area was done by Dr John Hut­ton, a pae­di­a­tri­cian and clin­i­cal re­searcher at Cincin­nati Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal in the United States.</p>
    <p>He took scans of brain ac­tiv­ity in chil­dren aged three to five, while they were read­ing e-books and printed books, to un­der­stand what is re­ally go­ing on in a child’s brain when en­gag­ing with these dif­fer­ent types of books.</p>
    <p>Dr Hut­ton and his col­leagues did MRI scans of pre-school-age chil­dren while pre­sent­ing five-minute sto­ries in dif­fer­ent for­mats by the same au­thor.</p>
    <p>For the printed book, chil­dren lis­tened to the story be­ing nar­rated while big pic­tures were pro­jected on the screen. The chil­dren were then told the same story in e-book for­mat, with a fully an­i­mated car­toon and nar­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>While us­ing the e-book with an­i­ma­tion, the brain scans of the chil­dren pre­sented a strik­ing drop in over­all con­nec­tiv­ity among dif­fer­ent parts of the brain.</p>
    <p>The scans also showed the chil­dren strug­gling to keep track of what was hap­pen­ing in the fast­mov­ing an­i­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Hut­ton con­cluded that read­ing printed books was bet­ter, as the scans showed a bal­anced in­te­gra­tion of the vis­ual net­works and the lan­guage net­works.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained that printed books with pic­tures help to de­velop the “men­tal mus­cles” in a child, by al­low­ing him to form men­tal images and re­flect on a story’s mean­ing.</p>
    <p>What we’re re­ally after in read­ing to our chil­dren is be­hav­iour that sparks a con­ver­sa­tion. But if that book has things that dis­rupt the con­ver­sa­tion, like a game plopped right in the mid­dle of the story, then it’s not of­fer­ing you the same ad­van­tages as an old-fash­ioned book. ’’ DR KATHY HIRSH-PASEK, pro­fes­sor of psy­chol­ogy at Tem­ple University</p>
    <p>With e-books, too much ex­po­sure to an­i­ma­tion tends to shut down the net­works, as the images move too quickly.</p>
    <p>“When par­ents show them a video of a story, that short cir­cuits the process – the child does not have to imag­ine the story – it’s be­ing fed to them,” said Dr Hut­ton.</p>
    <p>He also pointed to var­i­ous other stud­ies and con­cluded that read­ing to a child from an elec­tronic de­vice un­der­cuts the dy­namic that drives lan­guage devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Some call this the “serve and re­turn” model of in­ter­ac­tion be­tween a par­ent and a child. This takes place when a par­ent reads a book with a child – turning pages, point­ing at pic­tures, talk­ing about the story.</p>
    <p>Dr Hut­ton noted that those things are lost when par­ents use an e-book.</p>
    <p>Apart from de­vel­op­ing read­ing abil­i­ties, “serve and re­turn” also de­vel­ops rea­son­ing, think­ing and even cre­ativ­ity in a child.</p>
    <p>Read­ing ex­perts also note that as tech­nol­ogy evolves, pub­lish­ers are adding bells and whis­tles, in­clud­ing mu­sic and games to e-books, that en­cour­age de­tours. This can be counter-pro­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>In a 2013 Tem­ple University study in the US, re­searchers found that chil­dren aged from three to five had lower read­ing com­pre­hen­sion in cases where their par­ents read to them from e-books than those whose par­ents used tra­di­tional books.</p>
    <p>Part of the rea­son, they said, was that par­ents and chil­dren us­ing an elec­tronic de­vice spent more time fo­cus­ing on the de­vice it­self than on the story.</p>
    <p>“Par­ents were lit­er­ally putting their hands over the kids’ hands and say­ing, ‘Wait, don’t press the but­ton yet. Fin­ish this up first’,” said Dr Ju­lia Parish-Mor­ris, the lead au­thor of the study in her re­marks to the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Echo­ing Dr Hut­ton’s re­marks, she said par­ents who used con­ven­tional books were more likely to en­gage in what education re­searchers call “di­a­logic read­ing”, the sort of back-and-forth dis­cus­sion of the story and its re­la­tion to the child’s life.</p>
    <p>“What we’re re­ally after in read­ing to our chil­dren is be­hav­iour that sparks a con­ver­sa­tion,” said Dr Kathy Hirsh-Pasek, a pro­fes­sor of psy­chol­ogy at Tem­ple and co-au­thor of the study.</p>
    <p>“But if that book has things that dis­rupt the con­ver­sa­tion, like a game plopped right in the mid­dle of the story, then it’s not of­fer­ing you the same ad­van­tages as an old­fash­ioned book.”</p>
    <p>The les­son for par­ents is that tech­nol­ogy is great, but it can’t re­place the ex­pe­ri­ence kids have shar­ing a pic­ture book with mum or dad, es­pe­cially dur­ing the re­ally im­por­tant early years.</p>
