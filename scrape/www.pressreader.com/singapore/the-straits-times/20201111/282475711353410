    <p>Paul Pogba “can­not be happy” with the sit­u­a­tion he finds him­self in at Manch­ester United, France coach Di­dier Deschamps has said ahead of the world cham­pi­ons’ friendly with Fin­land to­day.</p>
    <p>The mid­fielder has started just four of United’s seven Premier League games this sea­son, and one of three in the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>His fu­ture re­mains un­cer­tain af­ter sug­gest­ing last month he “dreams” of play­ing for Real Madrid. Deschamps is con­cerned with his lack of play­ing time.</p>
    <p>“He is in a sit­u­a­tion with his club where he can­not be happy, nei­ther with his play­ing time, nor with his po­si­tion­ing,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“He is not in his best pe­riod, he has had a se­ries of in­juries and the Covid-19 which has hit him quite hard. He needs to find his rhythm.</p>
    <p>“With me, there is no such con­cern. When a player is in dis­com­fort in his club, ob­vi­ously, he is happy to play for the France team. He will tell me about his feel­ings and as I know him very well, it will go in a pos­i­tive di­rec­tion.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter Fin­land, Les Bleus will take on Euro­pean cham­pi­ons Por­tu­gal in Lis­bon on Satur­day be­fore round­ing off their Na­tions League cam­paign at home against Swe­den on Tues­day.</p>
