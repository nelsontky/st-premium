    <p>While oth­ers have been win­ing and din­ing in phase two of the eas­ing of Covid-19 re­stric­tions, Ms Shannon Lee is not giv­ing up vir­tual so­cial­is­ing. She has con­tin­ued her Zoom calls with friends, with a bot­tle of red wine and a plat­ter of cold cuts and bread sticks.</p>
    <p>Her vir­tual happy hours, which started once or twice a week dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, are some­times like mini theme par­ties. The nib­bles for Span­ish night, for in­stance, in­clude mar­i­nated olives and a Span­ish chorizo omelette.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee, 48, who works in real es­tate man­age­ment, has grown to like the flex­i­bil­ity of tele-so­cial­is­ing. “I get to choose what I like and I don’t have to travel any­where,” she says.</p>
    <p>When din­ing at a restau­rant, for ex­am­ple, a group may have to cater for some­one go­ing carb-free and some­one who does not eat meat.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, when Ms Lee is at home on Zoom, the hum­mus she whips up for bar snacks can be cus­tomised to con­tain as much or as lit­tle gar­lic as she prefers.</p>
    <p>As such, the sin­gle mother of an 11-year-old has not been meet­ing friends face-to-face much. She prefers to min­imise so­cial con­tact be­cause there are still Covid-19 cases in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Con­sumerism has taken a back seat for her, like many oth­ers, dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent survey con­ducted by per­sonal finance website SingSaver, re­spon­dents in Sin­ga­pore felt that their spend­ing habits had changed. About 87 per cent agreed that the pan­demic has led them to spend less and save more.</p>
    <p>With the world go­ing into re­ces­sion, Ms Lee says “it’s in­evitable that we look into our per­sonal fi­nances and min­imise risk and ex­po­sure”.</p>
    <p>She has signed up for a credit card that of­fers bet­ter re­bates and is look­ing anew at her fi­nan­cial port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>While many have baulked at video-con­fer­ence catch-ups be­fore, deem­ing them too im­per­sonal, Ms Lee feels these and other Covid-19 adap­ta­tions are keep­ers for the long term.</p>
    <p>She saves on the ex­pense of tak­ing a cab to and from drinks sessions.</p>
    <p>“It’s cost ef­fec­tive and forces us to make more ef­fi­cient use of our time,” she adds.</p>
