    <p>• China said the United States “has been flip­ping flop­ping all the time” and urged it to re­spect mar­ket prin­ci­ples af­ter in­vestors were whip­sawed by un­cer­tainty over the sta­tus of three ma­jor Chi­nese telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions gi­ants traded on the New York Stock Ex­change (NYSE).</p>
    <p>Just four days af­ter de­cid­ing to delist China Mo­bile, China Uni­com Hong Kong and China Tele­com, the bourse on Mon­day abruptly with­drew that plan.</p>
    <p>Later, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said it is con­sid­er­ing pro­ceed­ing with the delist­ing.</p>
    <p>The flip-flop has caused con­fu­sion over Amer­ica’s pol­icy be­hind NYSE’s move: Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Novem­ber ex­ec­u­tive or­der bar­ring Amer­i­can in­vest­ments in busi­nesses owned or con­trolled by the Chi­nese mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>“Some politi­cians i n the US have been op­press­ing for­eign com­pa­nies listed in the US,” for­eign min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing told a daily brief­ing in Bei­jing yes­ter­day. “This has rather lim­ited im­pact on the Chi­nese com­pa­nies, but it will hurt the US na­tional in­ter­ests and its own i mage, and will hurt its global sta­tus as a cap­i­tal mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>Ms Hua said she hoped the US would “do more things con­ducive to the global fi­nan­cial mar­ket sys­tem, pro­tect the in­vestors’ rights and in­ter­ests, and do good for global eco­nomic sta­bil­ity and devel­op­ment”.</p>
    <p>While China has largely dis­missed any move to delist the stocks as hav­ing min­i­mal im­pact on the busi­nesses, it has main­tained that such a step would hurt the US more than the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Call­ing the delist­ing de­ci­sion un­wise, China Se­cu­ri­ties Reg­u­la­tory Com­mis­sion ear­lier said that the US risks un­der­min­ing its own po­si­tion in the global cap­i­tal mar­kets by show­ing its rules and in­sti­tu­tions can be­come “ar­bi­trary, reck­less and un­pre­dictable”.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has not an­nounced re­tal­ia­tory mea­sures, and has been seek­ing to avoid an es­ca­la­tion of the ten­sions be­fore Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den steps into the White House.</p>
    <p>But state-backed me­dia have cited an­a­lysts sug­gest­ing China can ask US firms op­er­at­ing in the coun­try to dis­close mil­i­tary links.</p>
    <p>Since Mr Trump signed the or­der tar­get­ing firms linked to the Chi­nese mil­i­tary, the three telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pa­nies have lost more than US$30 bil­lion (S$39.5 bil­lion) in mar­ket value through end-2020 in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The ex­ec­u­tive or­der has re­sulted in the re­moval of a num­ber of Chi­nese com­pa­nies from global bench­mark in­dexes, though at least one com­piler has said it would not delete the three Chi­nese tele­com firms af­ter the NYSE re­versed its delist­ing plans on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a brief­ing on Tues­day, Ms Hua said that “many Amer­i­can multi­na­tional com­pa­nies are the re­sult of mil­i­tary-civil fu­sion them­selves” and that on this is­sue, the US was “ap­ply­ing dou­ble stan­dards to con­tain China’s devel­op­ment”.</p>
    <p>In­vestors are con­cerned po­ten­tial delist­ings may ex­tend to oil ma­jors such as CNOOC, which is on the Pen­tagon’s list of com­pa­nies the US says are owned or con­trolled by the Chi­nese mil­i­tary.</p>
