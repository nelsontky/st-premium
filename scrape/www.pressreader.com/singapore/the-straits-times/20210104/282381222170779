    <p>NEW YORK • The ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) mar­ket is manic. Stocks have not been this ex­pen­sive since the dot.com era.</p>
    <p>The Nas­daq 100 has dou­bled in two years, leav­ing its val­u­a­tion bloated – all while volatil­ity re­mains stub­bornly high. It is a setup that has left in­vestors sit­ting on fat re­turns from 2020, a year that de­fied easy ex­pla­na­tion. It is also one that has a grow­ing co­hort of ex­perts warning about a bub­ble.</p>
    <p>Know­ing when mar­ket ral­lies turn from log­i­cal to ex­ces­sive is al­ways tough. It was nearly im­pos­si­ble as last year ended, with in­ter­est rates pinned near zero and the fed­eral gov­ern­ment un­leash­ing an­other US$900 bil­lion (S$1.19 tril­lion) into the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>But his­tory of­fers clues, and a raft of cur­rent mar­ket con­di­tions meet cri­te­ria that would likely be found on a bub­ble check­list.</p>
    <p>Take a study by Har­vard Univer­sity re­searchers pub­lished in 2019. It noted that while not ev­ery stock surge meets with dis­as­ter, those that do share some at­tributes, in­clud­ing in­creased share is­suance, height­ened volatil­ity, and a sec­tor or index that dou­bles and is twice as high as the broader mar­ket. Check, check and al­most check.</p>
    <p>“Are there ar­eas of the mar­ket that are in a bub­ble? Yeah, clearly,” said Mr Peter Cec­chini, founder of Al­phaOmega Ad­vi­sors, on Bloomberg’s What Goes Up pod­cast, adding that “many of those are ob­vi­ously spec­u­la­tive tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies”.</p>
    <p>Share is­suance, IPOs and blank-cheque com­pa­nies have grown so pop­u­lar that record af­ter record fell last year. United States com­pa­nies sold US$368 bil­lion in new stock last year, 54 per cent more than the prior high, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>IPOs raised US$180 bil­lion – the most ever – as com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Snowflake, Airbnb and DoorDash, took ad­van­tage of the re­bound in eq­uity mar­kets. First-day pops in share price among the new­com­ers were the big­gest in two decades, ac­cord­ing to Mr Bill Smith, chief ex­ec­u­tive and co­founder of Re­nais­sance Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“Those are tell­tale signs,” said Har­vard Busi­ness School pro­fes­sor Robin Greenwood, co-au­thor of the 2019 study.</p>
    <p>“The prob­a­bil­ity of a mar­ket cor­rec­tion is much greater to­day than in the historical av­er­age.”</p>
    <p>A sub-class of IPOs took off last year as well, adding to wor­ries.</p>
    <p>Spe­cial-pur­pose acquisitio­n ve­hi­cles (Spacs), which use pro­ceeds from a stock sale to ac­quire a pri­vate com­pany, raised about US$80 bil­lion last year, more than was notched in ag­gre­gate over the pre­vi­ous decade. Spacs that made a pur­chase are up about 100 per cent for the year, ac­cord­ing to re­search from Mr Ge­orge Pear­kes, global macro strate­gist at Be­spoke In­vest­ment Group.</p>
    <p>“That’s pretty bub­bly stuff,” he wrote in a re­cent note, though he added that what is more re­mark­able is that Spacs that have yet to</p>
    <p>an­nounce deals have gained about 20 per cent. “Ob­vi­ously, this is pretty spec­u­la­tive be­hav­iour.”</p>
    <p>While cer­tain as­sets ex­hibit wor­ry­ing signs, the broader mar­ket may not be in for an im­me­di­ate come­up­pance. For one thing, the US Fed­eral Re­serve has promised to keep in­ter­est rates pinned near zero, mak­ing stretched stock val­u­a­tions look more rea­son­able when com­pared with bond yields.</p>
    <p>And the Har­vard re­searchers say the Nas­daq 100, while on a his­toric run that has seen its price dou­ble in just two years, is still not ex­or­bi­tantly el­e­vated rel­a­tive to the S&P 500 Index, com­pared with pre­vi­ous bub­bles. The broader gauge has ral­lied 50 per cent since 2018 and is not trail­ing the tech-heavy gauge by enough to meet their cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>Bub­ble talk has sim­mered for months, prompt­ing plenty of warn­ings from the likes of Green­light Cap­i­tal’s David Ein­horn to Wolfe Re­search strate­gists.</p>
    <p>As the S&P 500 closed out last year with a solid but still-mod­est gain of 16 per cent, spots on the mar­ket’s kook­ier fringes have re­cently seen trou­ble.</p>
    <p>Since peak­ing last month, vaccine he­roes Moderna and BioNTech have both plunged 35 per cent without any ob­vi­ous cat­a­lyst for the sell­ing. FuboTV, up 596 per cent as at Dec 22, has lost al­most half its value as share lock-ups ex­pired. Shares of in­sur­ance com­pany Lemon­ade have swung vi­o­lently as sim­i­lar re­stric­tions were lifted.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple have got back to a nar­ra­tive-over­val­u­a­tion dis­ci­pline. You can slap the ‘dis­rup­tor’ name on some­thing and have it go up 10 times for no real rea­son,” said Mr Jon Bur­ck­ett-St Lau­rent, se­nior port­fo­lio man­ager at Ex­en­cial Wealth Ad­vi­sors. “So, yeah, there are pock­ets of the mar­ket that don’t make a tonne of sense to me.”</p>
    <p>Bub­ble warn­ings are li­able to get louder this year, when com­pa­nies will have to de­liver prof­its that jus­tify val­u­a­tions that by historical mea­sures have grown stretched.</p>
    <p>The S&P 500 ended last year trad­ing at al­most 30 times prof­its, mean­ing it will start a new year higher than at any time since 2000.</p>
    <p>The Nas­daq 100 is at 40 times earn­ings, a level not seen in two decades.</p>
    <p>Other price trends have raised eye­brows. Bit­coin’s record-break­ing ad­vance. Height­ened trad­ing by re­tail in­vestors that has in­flated pre­vi­ously lit­tle-known com­pa­nies. Tesla’s 750 per cent bulge.</p>
    <p>Through it all, the CBOE Volatil­ity Index never closed be­low 20 af­ter spik­ing to 80 last March.</p>
    <p>At 23, it re­mains above its longterm av­er­age of 19.5.</p>
    <p>“As spec­u­la­tive juices flow, peo­ple be­come more en­trenched with op­por­tu­ni­ties to make a quick buck. That could be dan­ger­ous,” said Mr Mar­shall Front, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer of Front Barnett As­so­ciates. “You never know how long the party goes, but it doesn’t end well.”</p>
