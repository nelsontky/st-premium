    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US has recorded two sober­ing mile­stones amid the coronaviru­s pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Its coronaviru­s cases rose by 77,848 on Satur­day, the sec­ond­high­est daily count on record.</p>
    <p>And deaths rose by more than 1,000 for the fourth day in a row, ac­cord­ing to data from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity and Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>There were 1,297 fa­tal­i­ties recorded on Satur­day in the coun­try, with the states of Cal­i­for­nia, Texas and Florida hit par­tic­u­larly hard by the out­break.</p>
    <p>Florida passed New York as the state with the sec­ond-high­est num­ber of to­tal coronaviru­s cases, be­hind Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>It re­ported 414,511 to­tal pos­i­tive tests on Satur­day, com­pared with 402,312 a day ear­lier, an in­crease of 12,199.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, New York added 750 pos­i­tive tests for a to­tal of 411,200.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions in the state fell slightly to 646.</p>
    <p>New deaths among Florida res­i­dents was 124, for a to­tal of 5,777, while New York recorded only 10 new deaths.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia re­ported 10,066 new Covid-19 cases on Satur­day, higher than the 14-day av­er­age of 9,407, the Depart­ment of State Health Ser­vices said on its web­site.</p>
    <p>The death toll fell slightly to 151 af­ter two con­sec­u­tive days of record fa­tal­i­ties, rais­ing the to­tal to 8,337.</p>
    <p>There have been 445,400 con­firmed cases of the coronaviru­s in Cal­i­for­nia, which has the coun­try’s high­est case count.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, over 150 prom­i­nent US med­i­cal ex­perts and health pro­fes­sion­als – in an open let­ter ad­dressed to the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, mem­bers of Congress and state gov­er­nors – said the best thing for the coun­try is not to re­open quickly.</p>
    <p>“Of all the na­tions in the world, we’ve had the most deaths from Covid-19. At the same time, we’re in the midst of ‘ re­open­ing our econ­omy’, ex­pos­ing more and more peo­ple to coronaviru­s and watch­ing num­bers of cases – and deaths – sky­rocket,” the ex­perts said in the let­ter.</p>
    <p>“Right now we are on a path to lose more than 200,000 Amer­i­can lives by Nov 1. Yet, in many states peo­ple can drink in bars, get a hair­cut, eat inside a restau­rant, get a tat­too, get a mas­sage, and do myr­iad other nor­mal, pleas­ant, but non-es­sen­tial ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump urged schools across the coun­try to re­open as long as they can prac­tise good hy­giene and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The bad news about the spike in cases is com­ing from many US states.</p>
    <p>Ken­tucky re­ported 836 ad­di­tional cases on Satur­day, its sec­ond-high­est daily record. There were at least 26,764 coronaviru­s cases re­ported in the state so far.</p>
    <p>Ken­tucky Gov­er­nor Andy Bes­hear forecast “ad­di­tional steps next week if the case num­bers don’t sta­bilise”.</p>
    <p>Texas, the sec­ond-big­gest US state by size af­ter Alaska, re­ported 6,020 new cases, a drop from 8,701 new cases the pre­vi­ous day. The state now has a to­tal of 375,846 con­firmed cases.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, south Texas was bat­tered by Hur­ri­cane Hanna in the early hours of yes­ter­day, with blis­ter­ing winds and crash­ing waves, leav­ing a large area al­ready badly hit by Covid-19 brac­ing it­self for tor­ren­tial down­pours and po­ten­tial flash floods.</p>
    <p>Hanna was later down­graded to a trop­i­cal storm.</p>
