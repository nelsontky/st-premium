    <p>As a health pro­fes­sional in the pri­vate sec­tor, I read with in­ter­est Mr Wong Boon Hong’s let­ter on ris­ing health­care costs (Fo­cus on root cause of ris­ing health­care costs; Oct 3).</p>
    <p>Mr Wong men­tioned three pos­si­ble is­sues for the au­thor­i­ties to ad­dress: de­fen­sive medicine, abuse of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion and mark-up of med­i­cal bills.</p>
    <p>With re­spect to the is­sue of de­fen­sive medicine, pa­tients and mem­bers of the pub­lic need to un­der­stand that mod­ern medicine em­ploys a prob­a­bilis­tic ap­proach, not ab­so­lutes. Fre­quently, di­ag­noses are not im­me­di­ately known at the first con­sul­ta­tion. Doc­tors need to in­te­grate in­for­ma­tion from the pa­tient’s his­tory, clin­i­cal find­ings, test re­sults and in­ves­ti­ga­tions to form a co­her­ent pic­ture of the di­ag­no­sis and for­mu­late a treat­ment plan. This of­ten takes time.</p>
    <p>The first, of­ten pre­lim­i­nary, tests cover a wide range of pos­si­ble di­ag­noses, which are nar­rowed down se­quen­tially as com­mon con­di­tions are ex­cluded. Less com­mon causes of a pa­tient’s symp­toms and signs re­quire ad­di­tional, some­times unique and spe­cialised, tests.</p>
    <p>Un­less ev­ery avail­able test is per­formed, there is a pos­si­bil­ity of a missed di­ag­no­sis and li­a­bil­ity for the doc­tor. Given the cur­rent liti­gious cli­mate, doc­tors are apt to prac­tise de­fen­sive medicine.</p>
    <p>One way to ad­dress this is­sue would be for the pub­lic to ac­cept the pos­si­bil­ity that a mi­nor­ity of pa­tients would have their di­ag­noses missed or de­layed if the mul­ti­tude of tests are not per­formed. These in­di­vid­u­als with missed or de­layed di­ag­noses should ab­stain from tak­ing le­gal ac­tion. Greater lit­i­ga­tion and in­dem­nity ex­pen­di­ture leads to a vi­cious cir­cle of in­creased health­care costs.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong also cor­rectly states that there are pa­tients who abuse hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion. This sit­u­a­tion is en­cour­aged by the struc­ture of in­sur­ance poli­cies that re­quire hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions for claims.</p>
    <p>Since pa­tient au­ton­omy is revered, doc­tors are hes­i­tant to deny them hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion even though out­pa­tient care is pos­si­ble, fear­ing a com­plaint for re­fus­ing to re­spect pa­tient au­ton­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong’s last com­ment needs to be qual­i­fied. Bench­marks for pro­fes­sional fees have been set, but there are no cor­re­spond­ing bench­marks for hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion fees and charges for med­i­ca­tions and in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>I urge Mr Wong as a mem­ber of the pub­lic, and there­fore one with­out con­flict of in­ter­est, to cham­pion a non-liti­gious so­ci­ety, to act to change the medico-le­gal tenet of pa­tient au­ton­omy and lobby for hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion fee bench­marks, which, in com­bi­na­tion, are likely to bring down health­care costs.</p>
