    <p>A study pub­lished on Sept 3 in med­i­cal jour­nal Jama Net­work Open sug­gested that vi­ta­min D de­fi­ciency may be as­so­ci­ated with a higher risk of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Vi­ta­min D is mainly pro­duced in the skin when it is ex­posed to the ul­tra­vi­o­let B rays of the sun. But de­spite Sin­ga­pore’s rep­u­ta­tion as a “sunny is­land”, many here are de­fi­cient in this vi­ta­min.</p>
    <p>The 2010 Na­tional Health Sur­vey found that 40 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans were de­fi­cient in vi­ta­min D, while an­other 8 per cent were very de­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>And the fig­ures do not seem to have im­proved much over the past decade. As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Ver­ena Tan, an ex­pert in di­etet­ics and nutrition at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy, cited a 2019 study that found the preva­lence of vi­ta­min D de­fi­ciency among in­door work­ers here was 32.9 per cent.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the con­di­tion is preva­lent not only in Sin­ga­pore but also else­where in South-east Asia, de­spite the pres­ence of sun­light all year round.</p>
    <p>“Sun-protection be­hav­iours such as use of sun­screen, stay­ing in the shade or in­doors, the wear­ing of long sleeves and us­ing um­brel­las are com­mon prac­tices in this re­gion,” she noted.</p>
    <p>The body needs vi­ta­min D to ab­sorb cal­cium and main­tain its bone struc­ture, said Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>She added that emerg­ing ev­i­dence also shows that vi­ta­min D is crit­i­cal for one’s im­mune func­tion.</p>
    <p>To get an ad­e­quate amount of vi­ta­min D, said Prof Tan, peo­ple are rec­om­mended to get sun ex­po­sure on their arms and legs for about five min­utes to 30 min­utes twice a week.</p>
    <p>The best time to do so is be­tween 10am and 3pm each day.</p>
    <p>Vi­ta­min D can also be found in eggs, liver and oily fish. Other sources in­clude for­ti­fied food prod­ucts such as milk, soya milk, yo­gurt, or­ange juice, break­fast ce­re­als and mar­garine.</p>
    <p>The daily rec­om­mended di­etary al­lowance of vi­ta­min D for those aged 18 and above is 2.5mcg a day.</p>
    <p>One large egg yolk has 1.02mcg of vi­ta­min D, and one 250ml cup of for­ti­fied milk has 2.9mcg to 3.1 mcg.</p>
    <p>“Thus, it is easy to achieve ad­e­quate vi­ta­min D from food and sun ex­po­sure,” said Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>She noted, how­ever, that more vi­ta­min D is not al­ways bet­ter, as too much may result in neg­a­tive side ef­fects such as a build-up of cal­cium in the blood, which can cause nau­sea and vom­it­ing, weak­ness and fre­quent uri­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“Al­ways check with a doc­tor or di­eti­tian be­fore start­ing a vi­ta­min D supplement or any high-dosage supplement,” she said.</p>
