    <p>The first signs that young vot­ers might have been cru­cial in the out­come of last Fri­day’s gen­eral elec­tion came early on Satur­day morn­ing as the re­sults were still sink­ing in.</p>
    <p>Asked at the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party’s (PAP) press con­fer­ence if the rul­ing party had lost the youth vote, Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong said young peo­ple have “very sig­nif­i­cantly dif­fer­ent life as­pi­ra­tions and pri­or­i­ties”. He had just seen a nearly nine-point vote swing against his party, with a record 10 op­po­si­tion can­di­dates win­ning seats in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>From an­a­lysts to politi­cians, many have since por­trayed the swing against the PAP – al­most every win came with a re­duced share of the vote – as an in­di­ca­tion of the need to bet­ter in­cor­po­rate younger per­spec­tives.</p>
    <p>For­mer MP In­der­jit Singh, in a Face­book post on Sun­day, said mil­len­ni­als were the group who most likely voted against the PAP. He es­ti­mated that more than half of young vot­ers had cast their bal­lot for the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>A day ear­lier, Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam, touch­ing on Sin­ga­pore’s ap­proach to race re­la­tions, said a new frame­work might be needed to take into ac­count “how (young) peo­ple feel that there’s a dif­fer­ent way of dis­cussing these things be­yond the tra­di­tional”.</p>
    <p>Yet, a poll con­ducted by The Straits Times in Fe­bru­ary found lit­tle hint of young vot­ers turn­ing away from the rul­ing party in the months lead­ing up to the elec­tion, sug­gest­ing that the swing against the PAP in this age group might have been caused by events closer to Polling Day.</p>
    <p>Vot­ing pat­terns among a sam­ple size of 400 first-time vot­ers in Fe­bru­ary were some­what sim­i­lar to how their par­ents may vote. Be­tween Fe­bru­ary and March, the poll found that bread-and-but­ter con­cerns – the cost of liv­ing, as well as job and hous­ing prospects – dom­i­nated re­spon­dents’ list of wor­ries.</p>
    <p>More tellingly, 36.5 per cent of them said they were in­clined to vote for the PAP, more than dou­ble the 15.5 per cent who said they were lean­ing to­wards the op­po­si­tion; about half were un­de­cided.</p>
    <p>A sam­ple of the same vot­ers were con­tacted again af­ter Polling Day and many said they had changed their minds, and backed the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Their rea­sons in­cluded spe­cific in­ci­dents that oc­curred dur­ing the hus­tings and a com­par­i­son of party man­i­festos, which led them to re­think what they val­ued and hoped to see in Sin­ga­pore’s fu­ture. Most said they were not vot­ing op­po­si­tion for op­po­si­tion’s sake.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive Cal­lista Khoo, a 22-year-old first-time voter, ended up vot­ing for the Work­ers’ Party (WP) in Ma­rine Pa­rade GRC de­spite her ad­mi­ra­tion for Mr Tan Chuan-Jin, who an­chors the PAP team there.</p>
    <p>“I re­spect the way Mr Tan ar­tic­u­lates his thoughts and in­ter­acts with peo­ple. Then I saw the WP can­di­date from my GRC re­cite a pan­tun,” she said, re­fer­ring to WP can­di­date Fadli Fawzi’s speech on Nom­i­na­tion Day, in which he re­cited a Malay poem call­ing on his au­di­ence to “light the fires in your will”.</p>
    <p>She re­spected his nod to tra­di­tional Malay po­etry as she felt there was a heavy em­pha­sis on Chi­nese val­ues in so­ci­ety here.</p>
    <p>Ms Khoo then found Mr Fadli’s Twit­ter ac­count and was im­pressed by the new­comer’s views and pro­fes­sion­al­ism. She said: “I re­alised I needed to give WP my vote be­cause they de­serve a chance for more</p>
    <p>EVEN IF IT’S NOT YOUR RE­AL­ITY...</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans need to re­alise that just be­cause this is not your re­al­ity, doesn’t mean that it isn’t some­one else’s lived re­al­ity. We re­ally should get out of our own shells and re­alise that there are so many Sin­ga­pore­ans out there who are liv­ing on the side­lines, and we need to start pay­ing more at­ten­tion to these vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als in our com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>VALU­ING DI­VER­SITY IN LEG­IS­LA­TURE</p>
    <p>Con­sump­tion of al­ter­na­tive me­dia from a young age and a rather de­vel­oped sense of so­cial con­scious­ness have em­pow­ered young vot­ers, have led us to ques­tion the sta­tus quo and value di­ver­sity in the leg­is­la­ture... In­come in­equal­ity and ageism in the work­place are still very per­ti­nent is­sues. More can be done to en­sure that the el­derly do not have to do back-break­ing work in their later years. This has carry-on ef­fects for my gen­er­a­tion as well, who would soon grow up to be the sand­wich gen­er­a­tion. I would like to see can­di­dates/par­ties look­ing into and tack­ling these prob­lems more proac­tively.</p>
    <p>For me, cli­mate change right now su­per­sedes the is­sue of jobs. Jobs are very im­por­tant and we should be pre­par­ing for that, but cli­mate change is an ex­is­ten­tial prob­lem. voices in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>“How else will vot­ers make an in­formed de­ci­sion about cred­i­bil­ity if the op­po­si­tion lacks the equiv­a­lent of the PAP’s op­por­tu­ni­ties and plat­forms to prove them­selves?”</p>
    <p>Ms Zhang Feng Fang, a pol­i­tics and eco­nom­ics un­der­grad­u­ate, said she was quite frus­trated dur­ing the nine days of cam­paign­ing as many in her cir­cle had swung to­wards the op­po­si­tion. The PAP sup­porter said: “The op­po­si­tion had a much bet­ter so­cial me­dia game but I also think a lot of youth had their own echo cham­bers for op­po­si­tion on­line.”</p>
    <p>Ms Zhang, 22, said she did not make any pub­lic com­ments on­line in sup­port of the PAP be­cause she feared that she would be seen as not sup­port­ive of her friends from the les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer (LGBTQ) com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>In the end, she voted for the team helmed by De­fence Min­is­ter Ng Eng Hen in Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC when her par­ents told her not to “bite the hand that feeds you”.</p>
    <p>For East Coast GRC res­i­dent Ger­ald Sim, 23, sev­eral events dur­ing the cam­paign pushed him to­wards the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>He cited the ver­bal slip-up by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat dur­ing his Nom­i­na­tion Day speech as one thing which raised doubts about whether he should be vot­ing for the PAP leader.</p>
    <p>The in­tern at a lo­cal mu­seum also said he was put off by the PAP’s de­mand on July 6 that the WP state its po­si­tion on Sengkang GRC can­di­date Raeesah Khan’s Face­book posts. Ms Raeesah is now un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion for al­legedly pro­mot­ing en­mity be­tween dif­fer­ent groups on grounds of re­li­gion or race.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent, he said, was “a show of po­lit­i­cal mud­sling­ing”.</p>
    <p>“It un­der­mines my trust in the in­cum­bent party even more when it re­sorts to de­liv­er­ing low blows by blow­ing out of pro­por­tion com­ments made by Ms Raeesah as a pri­vate cit­i­zen,” he added.</p>
    <p>More than 6,000 like-minded in­di­vid­u­als joined a Face­book group called “We Stand Be­hind Raeesah!”, while an on­line pe­ti­tion made the rounds, say­ing: “Let Raeesah Khan cam­paign in peace. Con­duct any in­ves­ti­ga­tions af­ter the elec­tions.” It gar­nered more than 19,000 sig­na­tures be­fore Polling Day.</p>
    <p>Young vot­ers and ob­servers be­lieve the PAP’s tar­get­ing of Ms Raeesah, 26, who has been an ac­tivist for the rights of the marginalis­ed since she was 17, back­fired on the party for its per­ceived high-hand­ed­ness.</p>
    <p>Mr G. Ki­ran, 25, who re­cently grad­u­ated from the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s law fac­ulty, said: “Some young vot­ers might have em­pathised with the dif­fi­cult po­si­tion Ms Raeesah was caught in be­cause of the sim­i­lar­ity in age, and the na­ture of so­cial me­dia, which has pro­vided plat­forms for users to pen brief and can­did thoughts.</p>
    <p>“Younger peo­ple may have been con­cerned about free­dom of speech and ex­pres­sion when the po­lice said they were in­ves­ti­gat­ing her over her al­leged on­line com­ments.”</p>
    <p>Oth­ers pointed out that sys­temic in­equal­i­ties do ex­ist in the coun­try and that Ms Raeesah was coura­geous to point them out.</p>
    <p>Apart from push fac­tors, there were also pull fac­tors for younger Sin­ga­pore­ans to vote op­po­si­tion. These in­cluded the WP’s pro­pos­als to tighten em­ploy­ment pass ap­provals and lower the age from 35 to 28 for sin­gles to ap­ply for Buildto-Or­der Hous­ing Board flats.</p>
    <p>Un­der­grad­u­ate Mar­tyn Da­nial, 25, a Choa Chu Kang res­i­dent, said he was at­tracted to the WP’s poli­cies, al­though it did not con­test in his GRC. He said: “The WP’s man­i­festo res­onated with me be­cause it would have di­rectly af­fected those around my age group who are about to join the work­force.”</p>
    <p>For Mr Sim, it was the tone of the WP team’s “sim­ple mes­sage of kind­ness”, which he said gelled with his val­ues. “I don’t want to be ex­tremely suc­cess­ful and rich while down the lad­der, there are peo­ple who have dif­fi­culty putting food on the ta­ble.”</p>

She is con­cerned about job prospects as the pur­suit of her dream job – work­ing in the arts – has been de­railed by the Covid-19 pan­demic but she feels eco­nomic poli­cies should not come at the ex­pense of is­sues like in­come in­equal­ity and race and gen­der dis­crim­i­na­tion.</p>

    <p>PUB­LIC RE­LA­TIONS TRAINEE YOGESH TULSI, 25.</p>
    <p>CHOOS­ING BE­TWEEN ECO­NOMIC AND SO­CIAL IS­SUES</p>
    <p>Al­though the Elec­tions Depart­ment does not re­lease fig­ures for the num­ber of first-time vot­ers, there were 229,900 Sin­ga­pore citi</p>
    <p>zens aged 20 to 24 as of June last year, ac­cord­ing to the Gov­ern­ment’s Pop­u­la­tion in Brief re­port.</p>
    <p>They likely reached the vot­ing age be­tween the 2015 elec­tion and this one, mak­ing up nearly 10 per cent of the 2.65 mil­lion Sin­ga­pore­ans el­i­gi­ble to vote this elec­tion.</p>
    <p>WP chair­man Sylvia Lim, in a re­cent in­ter­view with Bloomberg news agency, weighed in on whether the youth vote was a key fac­tor in the swing to­wards the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>She said that al­though in Sengkang, the 26 to 44 age range of the WP team matched the pro­file of vot­ers there and likely con­trib­uted to her party’s win in the GRC, “na­tion­wide, I’m not able to say right now whether the younger vot­ers tipped the bal­ance over­all”.</p>
    <p>All vot­ers, young or old, will make their own cal­cu­la­tions, she added.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think they will, in gen­eral, vote just as a protest, but they will also look at what is at stake, who is pro­vid­ing the al­ter­na­tive and whether they think they can ac­cept that per­son as their MP,” said Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>Young vot­ers who spoke to The Straits Times echoed this view. Many of them said their de­ci­sion was never a toss-up only be­tween who they thought could pro­vide “jobs, jobs, jobs” – a PAP elec­tion slo­gan pop­u­larised by For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan dur­ing a tele­vised de­bate – and which party could fa­cil­i­tate other so­ciopo­lit­i­cal goals like greater equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Rather, they re­jected the idea that they had to choose be­tween eco­nomic is­sues and is­sues like so­cial in­equal­ity, and in­stead, leaned to­wards can­di­dates from which­ever party that had plans for both ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic re­la­tions trainee Yogesh Tulsi, 25, said he is anx­ious about jobs and get­ting Sin­ga­pore out of its eco­nomic slump but thinks cli­mate cri­sis and civil lib­er­ties are also, if not more, press­ing con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“Cli­mate change is an ex­is­ten­tial prob­lem that I want to see a lot more plan­ning for,” he said.</p>
    <p>For some mil­len­ni­als, the Gov­ern­ment’s largely suc­cess­ful han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic was not enough to guar­an­tee their votes.</p>
    <p>Ms Nur Dyana Abu Bakar, 25, who works in the hard-hit avi­a­tion sec­tor, said the Gov­ern­ment has been largely ef­fi­cient in han­dling the Covid-19 out­break – and is glad to hear friends over­seas praise Sin­ga­pore for it. But is­sues such as the pace of de­vel­op­ment, the ris­ing cost of liv­ing and trans­parency of gov­ern­ment data are her top pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>She said: “We should be able to know how much of tax­pay­ers’ money is go­ing where, or what the Gov­ern­ment is fo­cus­ing on. I don’t mind higher taxes if I know that the money is go­ing to­wards some­thing good for Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are young vot­ers who agree with the PAP’s fo­cus on eco­nomic poli­cies. Law un­der­grad­u­ate Cle­ment Lim, 24, said he sup­ported the rul­ing party’s em­pha­sis on jobs and skills up­grad­ing be­cause it is “about en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to be in­de­pen­dent and not de­pend on gov­ern­ment hand­outs”.</p>
    <p>The PAP Youth Wing mem­ber, who vol­un­teers in Jurong GRC, added that the PAP still has many “MPs and lead­ers who gen­uinely care about so­ci­ety and its peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said: “I of­ten see MPs who go the ex­tra mile to en­sure that the needs of their res­i­dents are taken care of. Reg­u­lar di­a­logue ses­sions are held where min­is­ters try to un­der­stand so­ci­etal con­cerns, and ex­plain the Gov­ern­ment’s ap­proach to deal­ing with them.”</p>
    <p>For him, the elec­tion re­sults meant that the PAP should re­think its strat­egy for en­gag­ing younger vot­ers, rather than em­bark on a di­rec­tional over­haul.</p>
    <p>SO­CIAL ME­DIA AP­PEAL</p>
    <p>With re­stric­tions in place due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, this elec­tion took place largely on­line – a mi­lieu in which dig­i­tal na­tives like mil­len­ni­als are very much at home.</p>
    <p>The so­cial me­dia pres­ence of can­di­dates ac­quired greater weight, and how elo­quent and pre­sentable they were played a greater role. The per­son­al­i­ties of in­di­vid­ual can­di­dates also came un­der more scru­tiny than they would have in past hus­tings.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral PAP politi­cians, such as Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan ChuanJin, 51, have earned plau­dits for their on­line out­reach ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan be­came a lo­cal Twit­ter sen­sa­tion ear­lier this year for re­spond­ing or “clap­ping back” at a ne­ti­zen who con­fused him with Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing. The ne­ti­zen said: “Hello sir! I stan!” Mr Tan replied: “Hello. I Tan.” Stan is slang for an overzeal­ous fan.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic re­la­tions and events ex­ec­u­tive Joel Lim, 27, said it was im­por­tant for can­di­dates to reach out to young vot­ers on­line. He said: “A large ma­jor­ity of (first-time vot­ers) are ac­tive users of dig­i­tal plat­forms, which are also where they have their dis­cus­sions with their peers and, more im­por­tantly, ob­tain in­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim posted bite-size po­lit­i­cal analy­ses on his In­sta­gram ac­count and gained more than 11,000 new fol­low­ers dur­ing the elec­tion cam­paign. The first episode of his se­ries, called Po­lit­i­cal Prude, drew more than 10,000 views.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion can­di­dates also per­formed well.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party (SDP) chair­man Paul Tam­byah, an in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert, was among those whose cre­den­tials were lauded on so­cial me­dia by young vot­ers, who felt op­po­si­tion can­di­dates like him were equal in cal­i­bre to those fielded by the PAP.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, like Progress Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Party (PSP) chief Tan Cheng Bock, got young as­sis­tants to help him bet­ter tap the on­line psy­che of mil­len­ni­als. The 80-year-old ex­per­i­mented with mil­len­nial and Gen Z slang such as “hy­pe­beast” – a per­son in tune with the lat­est trends – and be­came an un­likely In­sta­gram hit for his “hy­pe­beast ah gong” per­sona.</p>
    <p>A day be­fore Cool­ing-off Day, SDP sec­re­tary-gen­eral Chee Soon Juan mixed jokes with ap­peals for more demo­cratic rights in an in­ter­view with on­line per­son­al­ity Preeti Nair, bet­ter known as Preeti­pls. The video was widely cir­cu­lated.</p>
    <p>Still, it is not clear how much can­di­dates’ so­cial me­dia ap­peal trans­lated into votes – Prof Tam­byah, Dr Chee and Dr Tan all lost by nar­row mar­gins.</p>
    <p>Also, young vot­ers said keep­ing an on­line pres­ence was not ev­ery­thing, and that on-the-ground ef­forts mat­tered.</p>
    <p>MacPher­son res­i­dent Soh Jun Ming, 27, said his MP Tin Pei Ling is pop­u­lar for the ef­fort she takes to be present on the ground.</p>
    <p>He said: “We oc­ca­sion­ally see her jog­ging around the neigh­bour­hood to greet some of the res­i­dents, and she has also im­pacted the lives of sev­eral of my neigh­bours, es­pe­cially dur­ing this try­ing pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial con­sul­tant added: “Some of my neigh­bours also said it is hard to vote for op­po­si­tion mem­bers if we don’t see them con­tribut­ing to the neigh­bour­hood.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tin, 36, romped home to vic­tory for the sec­ond time in the sin­gle seat, sweep­ing up 71.74 per cent of the votes in a con­test against the Peo­ple’s Power Party sec­re­tary­gen­eral Goh Meng Seng.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser said of the youth vote: “Whether or not they con­sti­tute a sig­nif­i­cant pro­por­tion of vot­ers, their votes are im­por­tant – more so if there’s a close con­test.”</p>
    <p>In West Coast GRC, the PSP lost to the PAP by just 3.4 points. If more cred­i­ble op­po­si­tion can­di­dates jump into the fray, the gap may con­tinue to nar­row, and this elec­tion could be a hint of what is to come.</p>
