    <p>Lo­cal ac­tress Rui En says her in­nate tomboy per­son­al­ity made things both easy and dif­fi­cult for her on the set of her new drama se­ries Mis­ter Flower.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old star plays Huahua, a mys­te­ri­ous woman whose body is in­hab­ited by the souls of two other char­ac­ters – a misog­y­nis­tic man played by Shane Pow and a va­pid young woman played by Hong Ling – over the course of the se­ries.</p>
    <p>Over a tele­phone chat with The Straits Times, she says: “I found the role of the vain young woman harder be­cause I’m nat­u­rally quite a tomboy. I grew up around male cousins so I’m very com­fort­able be­ing ‘chor lor’ (Hokkien for rough or crude).</p>
    <p>“But when I have to act girly and be this su­per­fi­cial bimbo char­ac­ter who judges peo­ple by their ap­pear­ances – that’s harder for me.”</p>
    <p>Chang­ing in and out of out­fits and make-up for her three sep­a­rate char­ac­ters also took time and, in one in­stance, even brought on an al­ler­gic re­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>When her body is in­hab­ited by Hong’s char­ac­ter in the se­ries, Rui En has a birth­mark on her face.</p>
    <p>She says: “The birth­mark was by the eye. It was achieved by mix­ing rub­bing al­co­hol and red pig­ment, which was then sprayed on my face with a brush. And I had to spray that on and take it off quite a few times.</p>
    <p>“One day, my skin was prob­a­bly sen­si­tive and when the al­co­hol hit my face, I just gasped be­cause it was so painful.”</p>
    <p>As a com­pan­ion piece to the se­ries, Rui En also hosted va­ri­ety pro­gramme Dare To Try, which fol­lows the lives of five celebri­ties, in­clud­ing her Mis­ter Flower costars Elvin Ng and Liu Lin­gling. The pro­gramme is avail­able on meWatch.</p>
    <p>While Rui En jokes that a day in Ng’s life is a lot of work­ing out, she</p>
    <p>I grew up around male cousins so I’m very com­fort­able be­ing ‘chor lor’. But when</p>
    <p>I have to act girly and be this su­per­fi­cial bimbo char­ac­ter who judges peo­ple by their ap­pear­ances – that’s harder for me. ’’</p>
    <p>RUI EN, on the chal­lenges of her mul­ti­fac­eted role in Mis­ter Flower</p>
    <p>was sur­prised by getai vet­eran Liu’s ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>She says: “I had no idea that she knows how to give hair­cuts and even does char­ity work by giv­ing hair­cuts at old folks’ homes.</p>
    <p>“I was learn­ing how to give hair­cuts and the team ac­tu­ally sent in a real per­son – a young man – to have his hair cut by me. I re­ally did not want to mess up his hair, so I was cut­ting so slowly and care­fully that it didn’t look like there was a dif­fer­ence at all.”</p>
    <p>Host­ing is some­thing the ac­tress rarely does. She says: “It’s in­ter­est­ing be­cause you just have to be as spon­ta­neous as pos­si­ble on-screen, un­like act­ing.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides pro­fes­sional chal­lenges, the last year pre­sented per­sonal ones for the ac­tress. In a post on her fan club RBKD’s In­sta­gram page in Oc­to­ber last year, she re­vealed that her pet cat died sud­denly.</p>
    <p>Though the loss still hurts, she says: “I think when you go through some­thing tough and you come out the other side okay – it’s very em­pow­er­ing.”</p>
    <p>Look­ing for­ward, Rui En is hop­ing to spend her 40th birth­day, which she will cel­e­brate this month, with her fans do­ing vol­un­teer work for the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery year, my fan club vol­un­teers with me for my birth­day cel­e­bra­tion. It’s more mean­ing­ful that way. Fans used to buy me so many gifts, like soft toys, that I just don’t need – so I fig­ured we should put that money and ef­fort some­where else.”</p>
    <p>As for whether she feels any anx­i­ety hit­ting the big four-oh, she says: “It’s not a big deal for me. I know peo­ple say ac­tresses have a shelf life, but I think if you have sto­ries to tell and you tell them well, that’s enough.”</p>
    <p>Mis­ter Flower airs on week­days at 9pm on Chan­nel 8. It is also avail­able on meWatch.</p>
