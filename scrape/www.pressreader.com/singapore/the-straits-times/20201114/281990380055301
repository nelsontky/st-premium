    <p>Un­til the coro­n­avirus pan­demic came along, free­lance con­sul­tant Isaac Neo, 26, had not been in­volved in or­gan­is­ing any so­cial ini­tia­tive in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But when he read about how vul­ner­a­ble groups, in­clud­ing mi­grant work­ers and low-in­come earn­ers, were suf­fer­ing amid the cri­sis, it prompted him and eight oth­ers to start the Covid-19 Mu­tual Aid Hub in April. The hub is a search por­tal which con­sol­i­dates ground-up ini­tia­tives to make it easy for those in need to find help.</p>
    <p>The act of vol­un­teer­ing for this, and talk­ing to oth­ers around him af­fected by the cri­sis, gave the po­lit­i­cal sci­ence grad­u­ate in­sights on so­cial wel­fare and in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>He says more should be done to make fi­nan­cial re­lief schemes more ac­ces­si­ble to the low­er­in­come. “Be­fore Covid-19, th­ese is­sues were ab­stract, but I saw the im­pact of the cri­sis and it has helped to open my eyes to th­ese is­sues.”</p>
    <p>He is among sev­eral young peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore The Straits Times spoke to who say that while the cri­sis has up­ended their life plans, it has prompted them to re­assess the val­ues they be­lieve should un­der­gird so­ci­ety and gal­vanised them into ac­tion if they saw a need.</p>
    <p>Cam­bridge Univer­sity un­der­grad­u­ate Leia De­vada­son, 21, says the ex­tra down­time and height­ened po­lit­i­cal con­scious­ness she gained amid the pan­demic gave her an op­por­tu­nity to set up a po­lit­i­cal web­site, Grass­roots Level Party, with her friend</p>
    <p>Me­gan Lim in March.</p>
    <p>The mu­sic stu­dent had re­turned from Bri­tain in March be­cause of con­cerns over Covid-19 there.</p>
    <p>The site, which pro­vided in­for­ma­tion about elec­tions and the po­lit­i­cal sys­tem in Sin­ga­pore ahead of July’s gen­eral election, was widely shared on so­cial me­dia, climb­ing to an av­er­age of 2,000 views per day in the weeks lead­ing up to Polling Day, says Ms Lim, 21, a stu­dent at the School of Art, De­sign and Me­dia in Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Echo­ing Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong, who said in Par­lia­ment in Septem­ber that rapid changes in Sin­ga­pore’s so­cio-po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment have been catal­ysed by the Covid-19 si­t­u­a­tion, Ms De­vada­son says it has prompted young peo­ple like her to re­assess their place in so­ci­ety and con­sider how poli­cies af­fect their lives.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim says that so­cial me­dia pro­vides an ac­ces­si­ble av­enue for young peo­ple to en­gage in con­ver­sa­tions about pol­i­tics and poli­cies with their peers even as so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules are in place.</p>
    <p>Says Ms De­vada­son: “It felt like a break­through point where some­thing in the old so­ci­ety was be­ing put to rest and we were in a po­si­tion where we could imag­ine how we could take our­selves for­ward.”.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing been ex­posed to the so­ci­etal in­equal­i­ties that Covid-19 has laid bare, she hopes to see a more eq­ui­table and com­pas­sion­ate so­ci­ety that is open to dis­sent and crit­i­cal dis­course.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also shaped the views of young peo­ple on vari</p>
    <p>ous so­cial is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil (NYC), par­tic­i­pants at an Emerg­ing Stronger Con­ver­sa­tion in Septem­ber – part of a se­ries of dia­logues or­gan­ised by the Gov­ern­ment – ex­pressed con­cern about the power asym­me­try be­tween em­ploy­ers and mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>They were con­cerned about chal­lenges faced by lower-in­come work­ers and said more could be done to sup­port lo­cal food pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Megha Saha, who vol­un­teered as an English-Ben­gali trans­la­tor for the mi­grant worker com</p>
    <p>mu­nity when Covid-19 cases peaked in dor­mi­to­ries, says her in­volve­ment in th­ese ef­forts opened her eyes to is­sues con­fronted by mi­grant work­ers in Sin­ga­pore, such as how they may face bar­ri­ers in ac­cess­ing health­care.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old, who works in the tech in­dus­try, says sup­port for mi­grant work­ers in Sin­ga­pore should be stepped up.</p>
    <p>An NYC spokesman says that the men­tal well-be­ing of many youth has been af­fected by the pan­demic as they face anx­i­ety over an un­cer­tain fu­ture, and stress over work</p>
    <p>and stud­ies, among other things.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a poll of 1,000 young peo­ple aged 16 to 34 in Au­gust, one in two re­spon­dents said Covid-19 has had an im­pact on their men­tal well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>But, at the same time, aware­ness of such is­sues has grown, with more youth step­ping up to reach out to their peers strug­gling with men­tal health is­sues, says Mr Asher Low, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Lim­it­less, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that works with young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic has pre­sented great chal­lenges, Singa</p>
    <p>pore’s young peo­ple have proven them­selves to be re­silient and adapt­able, says the NYC, which has part­nered in­te­grated mar­ket­ing agency DSTNCT to col­lect sto­ries of Sin­ga­pore­ans’ Covid-19 ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive Ame­line Tan, 24, who was en­gaged last year and had planned to get mar­ried in Au­gust this year.</p>
    <p>She had to call off her wed­ding and re­turn a re­sale flat to the Hous­ing Board af­ter break­ing up with her fi­ance in June, af­ter the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
