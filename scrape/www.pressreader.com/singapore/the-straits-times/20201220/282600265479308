    <p>Scroll to one of life coach Janus Chan’s hun­dreds of TikTok videos and you might see her act­ing out sketches set to catchy tunes.</p>
    <p>Amid the en­ter­tain­ment, nuggets of ca­reer ad­vice pop up, from how to look and sound con­fi­dent to how to make the most out of at­tend­ing a job fair.</p>
    <p>Ms Chan, 47, started post­ing on video-shar­ing app TikTok dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod ear­lier this year, record­ing pop­u­lar memes and post­ing them on Face­book to en­ter­tain her friends.</p>
    <p>In May, TikTok dis­cov­ered her YouTube videos on mind­sets and mind­ful­ness and in­vited her to post mo­ti­va­tional con­tent on its plat­form un­der the hash­tag #learning­is­fun.</p>
    <p>She switched to ca­reer tips af­ter re­al­is­ing there were many re­trenched peo­ple who needed more prac­ti­cal help.</p>
    <p>“I de­cided to share tips on job hunt­ing... re­sume writ­ing, in­ter­view­ing, what to do in-be­tween jobs and the mind­set to suc­ceed in an in­ter­view,” said Ms Chan, who was of­fi­cially cer­ti­fied as a coach in May last year.</p>
    <p>The re­sponse has been en­cour­ag­ing – some of her videos have gar­nered 20,000 to 70,000 views and Ms Chan said peo­ple have con­tacted her to share their suc­cess af</p>
    <p>ter get­ting tips from her.</p>
    <p>One of her most pop­u­lar posts has been on salary ne­go­ti­a­tion.</p>
    <p>She rec­om­mends re­search­ing the mar­ket rate for the role and not bring­ing up the topic of salary at the first in­ter­view, adding that a mis­take many peo­ple make is equat­ing the num­ber of years in the in­dus­try with achieve­ments.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Chan: “You can be in the com­pany for 10 years do­ing the same thing over and over again, but if an­other can­di­date has only three years in the in­dus­try but is al­ways up­grad­ing him­self and is will­ing to take up more re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, who do you think the com­pany is will­ing to in­vest more in?”</p>
    <p>Fel­low lo­cal TikToker Xavier Fok, 32, who started post­ing tips on work and life in July, has found a fol­low­ing with videos such as 3 Habits That Make You A Bet­ter De­ci­sion Maker and Why Sleep­ing Late Causes Night­mares.</p>
    <p>“The em­pha­sis of most ca­reer ad­vice is al­ways on the ca­reer it­self. How­ever, in or­der for us to do well in one area in life, we also need to take care of the other ar­eas.”</p>
    <p>The co-founder and chair­man of dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing firm Ally Media said his ad­vice is based on men­tors and peo­ple he has met, books and his per­sonal ex­pe­ri­ence ac­cu­mu­lated over the years.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, United States-based vet­eran ca­reer coach J. T. O’Don­nell also branched out to TikTok this year, and has since amassed more than 997,000 fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>This is in ad­di­tion to her reg­u­lar posts on LinkedIn, where she has more than 2.6 mil­lion fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms O’Don­nell also coaches via on­line ca­reer coach­ing plat­form Work It Daily, which she founded in 2008 and heads, but with TikTok, she says, she is able to help peo­ple at scale and give view­ers “aha” mo­ments, one minute at a time. TikTok videos have a 60-sec­ond limit.</p>
    <p>She said: “Sixty min­utes could pass and I could teach them 60 dif­fer­ent things – that’s re­ally pow­er­ful in the ca­reer coach­ing world.”</p>
    <p>What the 52-year-old most wants to tell young peo­ple is the im­por­tance of build­ing a per­sonal brand and net­work in or­der to com­pete against global tal­ent who may be able to ac­cept lower wages.</p>
    <p>“That is not be­ing taught to Gen Z and mil­len­ni­als, and they need to know this in or­der to com­pete in the fu­ture, or they’re go­ing to run into real prob­lems – be­cause they’re go­ing to build up life­styles and in­come lev­els as­sum­ing they’re al­ways go­ing to make that same money.</p>
    <p>“If they don’t in­no­vate... if they don’t brand them­selves, they will be in trou­ble. That gen­er­a­tion needs to learn that stuff, and they’re used to learn­ing it in fun and in­ter­est­ing ways.”</p>
