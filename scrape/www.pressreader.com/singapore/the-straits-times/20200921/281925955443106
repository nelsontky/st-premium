    <p>If, as seems pos­si­ble, Mr Joe Bi­den wins the United States pres­i­dency by peel­ing away older white vot­ers from the Repub­li­can coali­tion, lib­er­als won’t just win the White House; they’ll gain a new gen­er­a­tional vil­lain to be­moan.</p>
    <p>In­stead of sneers of “OK Boomer”, there will be a re­al­i­sa­tion that the last bas­tion of con­ser­vatism in a left­wards-shift­ing coun­try may soon lie with my own Gen­er­a­tion X.</p>
    <p>Let’s stip­u­late that gen­er­a­tional di­vi­sions are some­what ar­bi­trary and ar­ti­fi­cial, and that they track im­per­fectly with the age di­vi­sions favoured by most poll­sters. Gen­er­a­tion X con­sists of peo­ple born be­tween 1965 and 1980, which means that they are cur­rently in their 40s and early 50s, and poll­sters pre­fer to poll the 45- to 64-year-old co­hort, where Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s clear­est strength now lies.</p>
    <p>Still, poll­sters who track the gen­er­a­tions show Xers as more Repub­li­can than other groups.</p>
    <p>In the Morn­ing Con­sult sur­vey, for in­stance, Mr Bi­den has led con­sis­tently with baby boomers since the spring, while Gen­er­a­tion X is the only gen­er­a­tion with whom Mr Trump oc­ca­sion­ally pulls into a tie.</p>
    <p>Given that most peo­ple’s con­ser­vatism mod­estly in­creases as they age, this trend is prob­a­bly a pro­logue, and Gen X con­ser­va­tives will in­creas­ingly be­come the bul­wark of Repub­li­can sup­port – and the party’s lead­ers, whether in the form of Ms Nikki Ha­ley or Mr Josh Haw­ley or Mr Don­ald Trump Jr, Gen­er­a­tion Xers all.</p>
    <p>Which means that my gen­er­a­tion, so of­ten passed over, mer­its some ide­o­log­i­cal anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Noah Smith, the eco­nomics writer for Bloomberg and an edge-of-Gen­er­a­tion-Xer (born in 1980), of­fered the be­gin­nings of one last week on Twit­ter. The for­ma­tive world of Gen X, he pointed out, was one of Repub­li­can dom­i­nance in pres­i­den­tial pol­i­tics, evan­gel­i­cal re­vival in Amer­i­can re­li­gion and di­min­ish­ing so­cial con­flict over­all.</p>
    <p>“Xers grew up in a na­tion that was rapidly sta­bil­is­ing un­der con­ser­va­tive rule,” he wrote, sug­gest­ing that many Amer­i­cans now in midlife as­so­ciate the Grand Old Party with that sta­bil­ity and the sub­se­quent trends push­ing the coun­try left­wards with dis­or­der and de­cline.</p>
    <p>To Mr Smith’s list of Gen X-ian dis­tinc­tives I’d add a few more: the con­ser­va­tive in­flu­ence of John Paul II’s pa­pacy for Gen­er­a­tion X Catholics, the seem­ingly pos­i­tive trend­lines on race re­la­tions (vis­i­ble in polls of African Amer­i­cans as well as whites) from the 1990s to the early Barack Obama years and the ef­fects of the Ron­ald Rea­gan and Bill Clin­ton eco­nomic growth spurts, which en­abled my gen­er­a­tion to en­ter adult­hood un­der more pros­per­ous con­di­tions than the Great Re­ces­sion-era land­scape that hob­bled mil­len­ni­als.</p>
    <p>A cri­tique of Gen­er­a­tion X con­ser­vatism that started from this frame­work wouldn’t ac­cuse my co­hort of nostal­gia for the racial or re­li­gious land­scape of the 1950s; we don’t re­mem­ber it, and we don’t want it to re­turn.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the char­ac­ter­is­tic Gen X weak­ness on race is a com­pla­cent as­sump­tion that the Clin­ton-to-Obama pe­riod re­solved is­sues like the wealth gap or po­lice mis­con­duct in­stead of just tabling them – which, in turn, makes mid­dle-age con­ser­va­tives too apt to see Black Lives Mat­ter or Mr Obama him­self as reck­less dis­turbers of the racial peace.</p>
    <p>On eco­nomics, mean­while, Gen X con­ser­va­tives can be tempted into un­char­ity to­wards younger Amer­i­cans, in­ter­pret­ing their strug­gles and sym­pa­thies for so­cial­ism as a moral fail­ure as op­posed to a re­sponse to a more hos­tile eco­nomic land­scape than we faced.</p>
    <p>And the Gen X con­ser­va­tive can strug­gle to move be­yond what I’ve called Zom­bie Rea­gan­ism, stick­ing with a con­ser­va­tive pol­icy agenda that’s lost much of its rel­e­vance pre­cisely be­cause the Rea­gan agenda helped make the world in which we came of age.</p>
    <p>But along­side gen­er­a­tional my­opias there is wis­dom, too. By virtue of hav­ing “adulted” more suc­cess­fully than mil­len­ni­als – mar­ry­ing, home buy­ing and hav­ing kids ear­lier and in larger num­bers – Gen­er­a­tion X en­joys a cer­tain bour­geois re­al­ism about what sus­tains hu­man so­ci­eties, what choices in your 20s will make you hap­pi­est in your 40s, that’s ab­sent from the very on­line pro­gres­sivism of the young.</p>
    <p>There is an emo­tivism and nar­cis­sism that millennial lib­er­al­ism and boomer lib­er­al­ism seem to share, and in strong doses it’s poi­son for in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>The ironic com­mu­ni­tar­i­an­ism of Gen X con­ser­vatism prob­a­bly isn’t the per­fect an­ti­dote, but it may be all we’ve got. And Gen X con­ser­va­tives come by their hos­til­ity to emo­tivist lib­er­al­ism hon­estly be­cause many of us grew up amid its wreck­age.</p>
    <p>“Xers have lit­tle col­lec­tive mem­ory of ei­ther in­sta­bil­ity or lib­er­al­ism,” Mr Smith sug­gested, but that part of his anal­y­sis is wrong. To grow up in the 1970s or 80s was to come of age just af­ter lib­er­al­ism’s last high tide and to see ev­i­dence of its fail­ures all around – from the ur­ban blight and ug­li­ness left by utopian re­newal projects to the adult disarray and child­hood mis­ery sowed by the ide­ol­ogy of sex­ual lib­er­a­tion in its Hugh Hefne­r­ian phase.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans younger than Gen X have seen a lot of elite fail­ure in the past 20 years, much of it con­ser­va­tive or cen­trist, and the idea of vot­ing Repub­li­can, let alone for Mr Trump, be­cause of lib­er­al­ism’s dan­gers seems to many of them ab­surd. But what Gen­er­a­tion X con­ser­va­tives re­mem­ber is not a dis­tant past, nor an un­likely fu­ture. Their Trump sup­port may be a folly, but their con­cern for what comes next is earned.</p>
