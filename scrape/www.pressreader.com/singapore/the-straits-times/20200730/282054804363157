    <p>When it comes to cy­ber se­cu­rity ad­vice on China, the most com­mon re­frain is: Don’t go. If you do go, take “burner” de­vices with you and leave your lap­top and phone at home.</p>
    <p>This is the ad­vice multi­na­tion­als of­ten give their em­ploy­ees about travel to “high-risk” ar­eas. It’s a rea­son­able first step but it as­sumes the world can be neatly di­vided into safe and un­safe, and em­ploy­ees can be kept on the right side of the di­vide. It’s use­less for peo­ple like me, who en­gage with China and live in the belly of the beast.</p>
    <p>The United States gov­ern­ment’s ap­proach to the rise of China’s tech giants mir­rors this sim­ple ap­proach to em­ployee safety: Just don’t go there and make sure their com­pa­nies don’t come over here ei­ther. Over the past year, the US gov­ern­ment has ramped up its sanc­tions against Huawei in what amounts to an at­tempt to kill the com­pany’s global tele­coms equip­ment busi­ness. Now the US is con­sid­er­ing ban­ning Chi­nese so­cial me­dia apps, in­clud­ing TikTok.</p>
    <p>I’m very glad that we are talk­ing about cy­ber se­cu­rity and China, but find our cur­rent con­ver­sa­tion mis­guided be­cause it as­sumes we can “just not go there”.</p>
    <p>We can­not her­met­i­cally seal our­selves off from China and its com­pa­nies – nor should we try to.</p>
    <p>In­stead, we need to fig­ure out prac­ti­cal ways to meet a chal­lenge that has been with us since long be­fore the rise of China: our need to co­ex­ist in a world with peo­ple we don’t trust.</p>
    <p>The ra­tionale for US bans be­gan as a data se­cu­rity con­cern: If we can’t trust the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, we can’t trust Chi­nese com­pa­nies with our data. As a first ap­prox­i­ma­tion, it’s true that if you don’t trust a ven­dor, you shouldn’t use it: Just don’t go there. But cy­ber se­cu­rity con­sul­tants would tell you that if you give im­prac­ti­cal ad­vice, em­ploy­ees won’t fol­low it.</p>
    <p>Avoid­ing China is im­prac­ti­cal. Rip­ping out all of Huawei’s equip­ment from the world’s net­works is costly and Chi­nese groups would still re­main part of the global tele­coms sup­ply chain. Huawei and ByteDance, which owns TikTok, are only two of a vast num­ber of Chi­nese global tech play­ers.</p>
    <p>In the first three months of this year, more than half of all the smart­phones sold out­side China were from Chi­nese brands, not just Huawei but also Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo. Len­ovo sells a quar­ter of all the per­sonal com­put­ers in the world. And if you’re wor­ried about Bei­jing get­ting its hands on your data, you should be con­cerned about giv­ing it to Amer­i­can groups too: Ap­ple, Ya­hoo, Zoom and other US giants have ac­ceded to the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties’ re­quests for data or to freeze ac­counts.</p>
    <p>If that’s enough to make you want to turn off the de­vice you’re reading this on, it gets worse: The most com­mon data leaks don’t stem from the high-tech machi­na­tions of the Chi­nese se­cu­rity ser­vices or US com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>They come from sim­ple acts of dig­i­tal il­lit­er­acy, like us­ing easy-to-guess pass­words or not up­dat­ing your soft­ware.</p>
    <p>For ev­ery highly trained Chi­nese gov­ern­ment-spon­sored hacker, there are a dozen bored teenagers look­ing to cause mis­chief on­line, and you can be­lieve me be­cause I was once one of them (the lat­ter, not the for­mer).</p>
    <p>But in a way, I am bring­ing you good news. There are ef­fec­tive ways of pro­tect­ing your­self from 90 per cent of the threats out there. The peo­ple who create good cy­ber se­cu­rity re­sources do so in or­der to help us co­ex­ist in a world with per­va­sive threats. Be­ing on­line, like any form of en­gage­ment, brings ben­e­fits as well as costs. As China’s for­mer leader Deng Xiaop­ing said of open­ing up the econ­omy: If you open the win­dow, some flies will come in.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, the same ap­proaches re­searchers have de­vel­oped over decades for non-China threats also ap­ply to China. In the Huawei case, to pro­tect com­mu­ni­ca­tions over an un­trusted net­work, gov­ern­ments could man­date end-to-end en­cryp­tion and reg­u­lar au­dits for operators.</p>
    <p>In coun­tries such as the United Kingdom, how­ever, au­thor­i­ties are wary of their cit­i­zens us­ing strong en­cryp­tion be­cause it ob­structs their own spies as well as China’s.</p>
    <p>When it comes to TikTok, the more im­por­tant de­bate is about how its al­go­rithm con­trols what we watch – a con­cern for all the so­cial me­dia apps that influence us. Again, there is a whole field of re­search into al­go­rith­mic ac­count­abil­ity and trans­parency but it is not the fo­cus in the cur­rent TikTok de­bate.</p>
    <p>In­stead, we are still dis­cussing whether to ever have con­tact with China. But we can­not quar­an­tine our­selves in­def­i­nitely. We will have to face the threats pre­sented by Chi­nese tech with scru­tiny and safe­guards, not with dis­en­gage­ment.</p>
