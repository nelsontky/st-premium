    <p>It would bol­ster the coun­try’s pro­file to host the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum’s (WEF) next an­nual gath­er­ing of global po­lit­i­cal and busi­ness lead­ers – an event that also bodes well for Sin­ga­pore’s ail­ing tourism and events sec­tors, said ex­perts. The WEF Spe­cial An­nual Meet­ing 2021 is slated to take place in May.</p>
    <p>Host­ing the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum’s (WEF) next an­nual gath­er­ing of global po­lit­i­cal and busi­ness lead­ers bodes well for Sin­ga­pore’s tourism and events sec­tors, said ex­perts yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic health ex­perts also said that if han­dled prop­erly, the WEF Spe­cial An­nual Meet­ing 2021, slated for May 13 to 16, would be a tes­ta­ment to Sin­ga­pore’s abil­ity to man­age Covid-19 mea­sures for such a sig­na­ture event. The WEF meet­ing typ­i­cally at­tracts about 3,000 del­e­gates to its usual lo­ca­tion in Davos, Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>The switch to Sin­ga­pore next year be­cause of its han­dling of the coro­n­avirus puts the city state firmly on the map, said May­bank Kim Eng an­a­lyst Chua Hak Bin.</p>
    <p>He added that hav­ing all the world’s at­ten­tion on the South­east Asian coun­try presents an op­por­tu­nity for it to prove that it has emerged from the pan­demic un­scathed, and is ready to re­sume busi­ness as usual as a con­nec­tiv­ity hub for the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>This is only the sec­ond time that the WEF meet­ing will take place out­side of Davos since it be­gan in 1971. The 2002 edi­tion was held in New York, as a show of sol­i­dar­ity with the United States after the Sept 11 at­tacks.</p>
    <p>Mr Ben­jamin Chi­ang, Asean gov­ern­ment and pub­lic sec­tor leader at EY, noted that the choice made by the WEF was an “in­tan­gi­ble vote of con­fi­dence” in Sin­ga­pore as a meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­fer­ences and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) des­ti­na­tion ca­pa­ble of man­ag­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank economist Song Seng Wun said that while the “ex­cit­ing, head­line-grab­bing” news was worth cel­e­brat­ing, an­other mea­sure of suc­cess would be if the event can get the tourism and Mice in­dus­tries back on their feet, by giv­ing peo­ple the con­fi­dence to travel to Sin­ga­pore with­out hes­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s the bread-and-but­ter, reg­u­lar, rou­tine events in Sin­ga­pore – whether food fes­ti­vals or anime con­ven­tions – that con­trib­ute to monthly tourism re­ceipts,” he noted. “So while host­ing the WEF is a feather in the cap for Sin­ga­pore, more im­por­tantly, it’s the re­as­sur­ance it gives oth­ers that all events can be held here – safely.”</p>
    <p>In­dus­try stake­hold­ers agreed that the de­ci­sion was a ma­jor en­dorse­ment of Sin­ga­pore’s ca­pa­bil­i­ties as a lead­ing global Mice hub.</p>
    <p>This, said Mr Aloy­sius Ar­lando, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of Con­ven­tion & Ex­hi­bi­tion Or­gan­is­ers & Sup­pli­ers, would hope­fully lead to more job and busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties – and in turn help Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic growth along.</p>
    <p>This year’s gath­er­ing in Davos, in Jan­uary, was at­tended by the likes of US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and teen cli­mate ac­tivist Greta Thun­berg.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try re­it­er­ated that</p>
    <p>not­ing that while the news of Sin­ga­pore host­ing the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum event next year was worth cel­e­brat­ing, an­other mea­sure of suc­cess would be if the event can get the tourism and Mice sec­tors back on their feet, by giv­ing peo­ple the con­fi­dence to travel to Sin­ga­pore with­out hes­i­ta­tion. the health and safety of the lo­cal com­mu­nity and meet­ing at­ten­dees was “of ut­most im­por­tance”.</p>
    <p>“At­ten­dees will be re­quired to ad­here to the pre­vail­ing strin­gent pub­lic health re­quire­ments, and safe man­age­ment and dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in Sin­ga­pore,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Dr Jeremy Lim, from the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), said: “Ev­ery­one who can be vac­ci­nated should be vac­ci­nated. And we prob­a­bly need to have a tiered test­ing regime based on coun­tries – sim­i­lar to what Sin­ga­pore has been do­ing.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Host­ing the WEF is a higher risk than not host­ing the WEF. So it’s re­ally about man­ag­ing the risk, and at es­sen­tially three points.</p>
    <p>“First, mak­ing sure, to the best of our abil­i­ties, no one with Covid-19 comes into Sin­ga­pore. Sec­ond, any­one who has Covid-19 and some­how slips through is de­tected early enough to min­imise trans­mis­sion. And third, if there is trans­mis­sion, we de­tect it early enough that we can lock down all the per­sons who have been in con­tact, so that we can con­tain any sec­ondary, ter­tiary spread.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher from NUS’ Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine said: “We’ve got all these tools to pre­vent spread, and it’ll be a com­bi­na­tion of tests or in­ter­ven­tions to make this par­tic­u­lar con­fer­ence safe. I’m quite sure that Sin­ga­pore will not let this be­come a ‘su­per­spreader’ event.”</p>
    <p>INSPIRING CON­FI­DENCE</p>
    <p>It’s the bread-and-but­ter, reg­u­lar, rou­tine events in Sin­ga­pore – whether food fes­ti­vals or anime con­ven­tions – that con­trib­ute to monthly tourism re­ceipts. So while host­ing the WEF is a feather in the cap for Sin­ga­pore, more im­por­tantly, it’s the re­as­sur­ance it gives oth­ers that all events can be held here – safely.</p>
