    <p>A deputy di­rec­tor at the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS), Rikram Jit Singh Rand­hir Singh, and his wife, Asya Kirin Kames, al­legedly worked to­gether to cheat the sport­ing body of more than $600,000 in to­tal be­tween 2016 and 2018. They were each charged with 45 counts of cheat­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A deputy di­rec­tor at the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) and his wife al­legedly worked to­gether to cheat the sport­ing body of more than $600,000 in to­tal be­tween 2016 and 2018.</p>
    <p>Rikram Jit Singh Rand­hir Singh, 40, was han­dling com­mer­cial and busi­ness de­vel­op­ment at FAS, while his wife Asya Kirin Kames, 33, was a di­rec­tor of a firm called All Re­source Net­work (ARN), which dealt with sport­ing goods.</p>
    <p>They were each charged yes­ter­day with 45 counts of cheat­ing..</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times, FAS said it sacked Singh on Jan 7 last year.</p>
    <p>“We have ex­tended our full co­op­er­a­tion to the au­thor­i­ties and are un­able to com­ment as court pro­ceed­ings are on­go­ing,” added an FAS spokesman.</p>
    <p>Singh and Asya are ac­cused of com­mit­ting the of­fences with two other men – Shankar Sup­piah, 43, and Pal­la­niap­pan Ravin­dran, 47 – who were also charged yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Shankar, who was also a di­rec­tor at ARN, faces 37 cheat­ing charges, while Pal­la­niap­pan, a di­rec­tor at event or­gan­iser Myr­iad Sports & Events (MSE), was slapped with 15 charges.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the Corrupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bu­reau (CPIB)</p>
    <p>said in­voices from ARN were sub­mit­ted to FAS as part of the al­leged con­spir­acy.</p>
    <p>These in­voices pur­port­edly con­cealed Singh’s al­leged in­volve­ment with ARN.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, FAS is said to have been dis­hon­estly in­duced to award jobs to ARN, pay­ing it more than $180,000 in to­tal be­tween 2017 and 2018.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple had also al­legedly con­spired with Shankar and Pal­la­niap­pan to sub­mit quo­ta­tions from MSE to FAS.</p>
    <p>CPIB added: “(These) dis­hon­estly con­cealed the al­leged facts that the works on the said MSE quo­ta­tions would be car­ried out by ARN in­stead of MSE, and of (Singh’s) in­volve­ment in ARN.”</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, FAS is said to have</p>
    <p>been dis­hon­estly in­duced to award jobs to MSE, pay­ing it more than $450,000 in to­tal be­tween 2016 and 2018.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing all four Sin­ga­pore­ans have been ad­journed to Jan 13 next year. For each count of cheat­ing, an of­fender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.</p>
