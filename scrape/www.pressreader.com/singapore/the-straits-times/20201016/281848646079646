    <p>ARNON NAMPA</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old hu­man rights lawyer rep­re­sents po­lit­i­cal ac­tivists and lese ma­jeste de­fen­dants in court. Dur­ing an Aug 3 rally, he shook Thai­land by openly call­ing for the monarch’s pow­ers to be trimmed. Since then, he has fre­quently re­peated his mes­sage on stage, open­ing the way for pub­lic dis­cus­sion about the role of Thai­land’s pow­er­ful monar­chy.</p>
    <p>PARIT CHI­WARAK</p>
    <p>Nick­named “Pen­guin”, the fiery 22-year-old pol­i­tics stu­dent at Tham­masat Univer­sity has been a po­lit­i­cal ac­tivist since high school, when he served as sec­re­tary-gen­eral of re­form group Ed­u­ca­tion for the Lib­er­a­tion of Siam. In 2018, he co-founded the Stu­dent Union of Thai­land to mo­bilise stu­dents across the coun­try. He is also a key mem­ber of United Front of Tham­masat and Demon­stra­tion, a stu­dent group that has emerged as the most vir­u­lent critic of the monar­chy.</p>
    <p>PANUSAYA SITHI­JI­RAWAT­TANAKUL</p>
    <p>Nick­named “Rung”, the 22-year-old so­ci­ol­ogy and an­thro­pol­ogy stu­dent at Tham­masat Univer­sity is also a leader of the stu­dent group United Front of Tham­masat and Demon­stra­tion. On Aug 10, she riled roy­al­ists by read­ing out a list of 10 de­mands re­lated to the monar­chy that in­cluded trim­ming the royal bud­get and stop­ping pub­lic­ity ef­forts ex­ces­sively glo­ri­fy­ing the monar­chy. At a mas­sive rally out­side the Grand Palace on Sept 19 and 20, she tried to de­liver a pe­ti­tion di­rectly ad­dressed to the King via his privy coun­cil pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>PANUPONG JAD­NOK</p>
    <p>Bet­ter known as “Mike Ray­ong”, the 23-year-old Ramkhamhae­ng Univer­sity stu­dent first rose to promi­nence in July when he and his friend tried to protest against the gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic dur­ing a visit by Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha in Ray­ong prov­ince. He is now at the fore­front of the protest in down­town Bangkok’s Ratchapra­song in­ter­sec­tion.</p>
    <p>JATUPAT BOONPATTAR­ARAKSA</p>
    <p>As a law stu­dent in Khon Kaen Univer­sity in 2014, Jatupat, bet­ter known as “Pai”, was among five stu­dents from grass­roots ac­tivist group Dao Din who flashed the three-fin­ger anti-dic­ta­tor­ship salute in front of Mr Prayut. In 2016, to­gether with over 2,000 oth­ers, he shared a BBC Thai pro­file of Thai­land’s new monarch, King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, that was posted on Face­book. He was charged with lese ma­jeste and sen­tenced to 21/</p>
    <p>2 years in jail. He was freed a few weeks early un­der a royal par­don. He is now 29 years old.</p>
