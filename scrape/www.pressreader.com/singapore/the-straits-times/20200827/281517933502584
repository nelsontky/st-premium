    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said there are more time slots for China-bound pas­sen­gers to get the nec­es­sary tests for Covid-19 af­ter scores of anx­ious pas­sen­gers showed up at the for­mer Shuqun Sec­ondary School yes­ter­day to be tested.</p>
    <p>The last-minute scram­ble was a re­sult of the Chi­nese Em­bassy here an­nounc­ing on its web­site last Fri­day that from to­mor­row, all trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore to China have to take a Covid-19 test within five days be­fore their flight, to en­sure they are free of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers who are booked on Flight TR100 bound for Guangzhou on Sun­day morn­ing were alerted to the new re­quire­ment in an ur­gent e-mail sent by Scoot on Tues­day af­ter­noon. The e-mail added that “test­ing ar­range­ments have been made by the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties and must be strictly ad­hered to”.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers on that flight were in­structed to go for the test at the re­gional screen­ing cen­tre lo­cated at the for­mer Shuqun Sec­ondary School in Jurong East be­tween 9am and 10.30am yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Last night, the au­thor­i­ties said there are more time slots for pas­sen­gers leav­ing for China by Mon­day. They can take the test at the Jurong cen­tre, which is open from 9am to noon and 1pm to 4pm daily, un­til Sun­day, said a joint state­ment from sev­eral min­istries, in­clud­ing Trans­port, Health and Man­power.</p>
    <p>Over 200 peo­ple, some with their fam­i­lies, were at the cen­tre when The Straits Times vis­ited yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pas­sen­gers had to pro­duce their plane tick­ets – for flights op­er­ated by Scoot and China South­ern Air­lines to var­i­ous Chi­nese cities – to se­cu­rity per­son­nel be­fore they were al­lowed to be tested.</p>
    <p>One pas­sen­ger who wanted to be known only as Mr Chen told The Straits Times that he plans to fly home to Guangzhou on Flight TR100. Mr Chen, who was at the test­ing cen­tre with his wife, was wor­ried about whether the flight would go ahead on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“This was a mess from the start. We thought we would fi­nally be able to see our fam­i­lies but our flights kept get­ting changed.</p>
    <p>“Now with this test­ing, I’m not sure if there will be more de­lays,” said the en­gi­neer who is in his 40s.</p>
    <p>The Chens, who both work in Sin­ga­pore, said they have not seen their eight-year-old son in months. Mrs Chen said: “It has been dis­tress­ing for us to not know when we can go back. I hope they will un­der­stand the dif­fi­cul­ties we faced to even get this flight ticket.” The cou­ple added that they had tried to book other flights home over the past two weeks, but ex­pe­ri­enced a lot of dif­fi­culty as tick­ets were snapped up.</p>
    <p>Other pas­sen­gers were also un­happy that the test was sprung on them. Ms Lin Yul­ing, an ac­coun­tant, said: “We were in­formed late last night. There are a lot more peo­ple here than ex­pected, and we are not sure how our travel plans will be af­fected now.” The 36-year-old, who was plan­ning to fly to Tian­jin with her hus­band on Sun­day, said she was told that pas­sen­gers have to pay for the test, which costs $186.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Scoot e-mail, pas­sen­gers must pay for the test be­fore the re­sults can be re­leased to them.</p>
    <p>Scoot also said that as the test re­sults will re­quire a turn­around time of 48 hours, pas­sen­gers must ad­here to the time slot for the test to be able to re­ceive the re­sults in time for the flight on Sun­day. The Chi­nese Em­bassy said on its web­site that it would take at least one work­ing day for test re­sults to be ver­i­fied af­ter pas­sen­gers sub­mit their re­sults to the em­bassy via e-mail.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers who test neg­a­tive for the virus and have filled in a health dec­la­ra­tion form will be is­sued a cer­ti­fied health dec­la­ra­tion form with an of­fi­cial em­bassy seal. The cer­ti­fied form is re­quired for pas­sen­gers who board flights to China.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, pas­sen­gers did not have to pay on the spot at the test­ing cen­tre, but had to pro­vide their bank­ing in­for­ma­tion such as credit card de­tails, as well as their con­tact in­for­ma­tion. Not ev­ery­one had the means to pay. A con­struc­tion worker who wanted to be known only as Mr Wang said he will ask his em­ployer for help. “Be­ing made to pay for this test all of a sud­den is an ad­di­tional bur­den,” said Mr Wang, who was go­ing home to Xi’an.</p>
    <p>A 23-year-old stu­dent, who gave his name only as Mr Yu, had booked a flight to Tian­jin on Sept 2. He said he was told to take the test even though his flight was can­celled.</p>
    <p>“I spoke to a Chi­nese Em­bassy of­fi­cial here who apol­o­gised for the in­con­ve­nience, since we aren’t sure if we can fly back af­ter all of this mess.</p>
    <p>“Can’t we get swabbed at the air­port? It’s frus­trat­ing.”</p>
    <p>CON­STANT DE­LAYS</p>
    <p>This was a mess from the start. We thought we would fi­nally be able to see our fam­i­lies but our flights kept get­ting changed.</p>
    <p>Now with this test­ing,</p>
    <p>I’m not sure if there will ’’ be more de­lays.</p>
    <p>MR CHEN, a pas­sen­ger who hopes to fly home to Guangzhou on Scoot Flight TR100. CAUGHT OFF GUARD</p>
    <p>Be­ing made to pay for this test all of a sud­den is an ad­di­tional bur­den.</p>
    <p>I will ask my em­ployer for help be­cause it’s not easy for peo­ple like us</p>
    <p>’’ to just fork out $186.</p>
    <p>MR WANG, a con­struc­tion worker who will be go­ing home to Xi’an.</p>
