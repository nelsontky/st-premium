    <p>For the past 13 days, there has been zero Covid-19 cases from the dor­mi­to­ries and the com­mu­nity, mark­ing the long­est stretch with­out lo­cal cases in Sin­ga­pore since the pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>Al­though in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­perts say this in­di­cates Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess in con­tain­ing the virus amid soar­ing and resurg­ing cases abroad, they stress that it is not time to get com­pla­cent as Covid-19 is not over in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Since Nov 1, there have been fewer lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases, with two from the com­mu­nity and five from the dorms on Nov 3, 4, 5 and 10.</p>
    <p>Al­though lo­cal cases seem to be ta­per­ing off, the ex­perts cau­tioned that lo­cal cases may still be lurking.</p>
    <p>“Get­ting zero cases does not mean we have reached zero in­fec­tions,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alex Cook, vice-dean of re­search at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>The school’s dean, Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, added: “There could still be a very small num­ber of un­de­tected asymp­to­matic or mildly symp­to­matic cases that are cir­cu­lat­ing, and may seed fur­ther com­mu­nity cases.</p>
    <p>“Un­less there is wide­spread and rou­tine test­ing like what we do for mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries, it will be dif­fi­cult to iden­tify asymp­to­matic cases in the com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>Also, with im­ported cases trail­ing in each day, the chances of im­ported in­fec­tions seep­ing into the com­mu­nity still ex­ist, said the ex­perts. Since Nov 1, the coun­try has mostly seen im­ported cases in sin­gle dig­its daily, with the high­est be­ing 18 on Nov 11.</p>
    <p>“Even with 14 days of strict quar­an­tine and an exit test, a small per­cent­age of in­fected trav­ellers will pass un­de­tected. That is why I don’t get too ex­cited about reach­ing zero cases – there is al­ways a risk of spillover from im­por­ta­tions,” said Prof Cook.</p>
    <p>Some who get in­fected shortly be­fore fly­ing into Sin­ga­pore will have a long in­cu­ba­tion or la­tent pe­riod be­fore the virus man­i­fests it­self, and that causes them to test neg­a­tive on their exit swab at the end of their quar­an­tine, he added.</p>
    <p>“Most im­ported cases will be de­tected, either man­i­fest­ing symp­toms while in quar­an­tine or test­ing pos­i­tive at exit, but a small frac­tion will not be,” Prof Cook said.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts also said im­ported cases may rise dur­ing the fes­tive sea­sons be­tween next month and Fe­bru­ary, and as more stu­dents study­ing abroad re­turn home dur­ing the win­ter break.</p>
    <p>But the chances of them spread­ing Covid-19 to the com­mu­nity are slim as Sin­ga­pore fre­quently up­dates its bor­der con­trol mea­sures and stay-home no­tice (SHN) poli­cies based on changes in the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion abroad.</p>
    <p>From this month, all trav­ellers from Es­to­nia, Nor­way, Malaysia and Ja­pan must serve their 14day SHN at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties ow­ing to a resur­gence of cases in these coun­tries. Pre­vi­ously, el­i­gi­ble trav­ellers could com­plete their SHN in their homes, while trav­ellers from Malaysia, ex­cept Sabah, could serve their sev­en­day SHN in their homes.</p>
    <p>At the dorms, ex­perts at­tribute the turn­around of cases to mea­sures such as fort­nightly test­ing of the mi­grant work­ers to ring fence cases, move­ment re­stric­tions and re­duc­ing the den­sity of work­ers in each dorm.</p>
    <p>“The longer that com­pre­hen­sive dis­ease sur­veil­lance is con­ducted with­out de­tect­ing new cases, the more likely that this means a re­duc­tion in cryp­tic cases in the dorms,” said Pro­fes­sor Gavin Smith, in­terim di­rec­tor of the Emerg­ing In­fec­tious Dis­eases Pro­gramme at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School.</p>
    <p>With no cases in the com­mu­nity or dorms for nearly two weeks, what is Sin­ga­pore’s cur­rent target in con­trol­ling Covid-19?</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore’s spell of zero com­mu­nity cases shows it is not a pipe dream, but at­tain­able and sus­tain­able,” said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>But main­tain­ing zero cases must be bal­anced with eco­nomic growth and safe re­sump­tion of so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties, ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>“Zero cases is fan­tas­tic, but we should not have zero tol­er­ance for cases,” said Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher of the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is lead­ing the way in nu­anc­ing its bor­der re­stric­tions to lessen the so­cial and eco­nomic im­pacts, and I think the health risks are very small and man­age­able.”</p>
