    <p>PETALING JAYA • Is­lamist party Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) is play­ing the role of me­di­a­tor to defuse ten­sions be­tween its two al­lies in Malaysia’s gov­ern­ing coali­tion, its top party of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The PAS move came about af­ter Umno’s top council at its meet­ing on Wed­nes­day said a mo­tion to sever ties with its erst­while ally Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu) would be de­cided at Umno’s an­nual assem­bly on Jan 31.</p>
    <p>PAS pres­i­dent Ab­dul Hadi Awang is me­di­at­ing a truce be­tween Umno and Ber­satu so that both par­ties will con­tinue with their po­lit­i­cal col­lab­o­ra­tion, a po­lit­i­cal source said.</p>
    <p>“Ab­dul Hadi does not want this (split) to hap­pen as he feels it is im­por­tant for all Malay-based par­ties to stay united,” the source told The Star news­pa­per on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Ten months ago, Ber­satu, Umno and PAS, to­gether with nine other po­lit­i­cal par­ties, formed the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment which is led by Ber­satu pres­i­dent, Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin. But Umno is un­happy with Tan Sri Muhyid­din as it sees it­self play­ing sec­ond fid­dle to Ber­satu in gov­ern­ment, even as half a dozen Umno lead­ers, in­clud­ing its pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, con­tinue to be pros­e­cuted in Malaysian courts on var­i­ous cor­rup­tion charges.</p>
    <p>Two of them, for­mer premier Na­jib Razak and for­mer Cab­i­net min­is­ter Tengku Adnan Tengku Man­sor, have been con­victed on sep­a­rate cor­rup­tion charges. This has in­flamed Umno which had hoped Mr Muhyid­din would have qui­etly in­ter­vened with the Malaysian courts to de­liver not-guilty ver­dicts.</p>
    <p>“There should not be these cases brought to court... (they) were the cru­elty from the time of Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad” as prime min­is­ter in 2018, Umno’s sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ah­mad Maslan said on Wed­nes­day, as quoted by Malaysi­akini news site.</p>
    <p>Pe­nang PAS com­mis­sioner Muham­mad Fauzi Yu­soff said the Is­lamist party is try­ing to save the “union” of the three main Malay Mus­lim par­ties.</p>
    <p>A break-up, he said, would ham­per PN’s chances at the next gen­eral elec­tion. Umno has said it plans to con­test the next gen­eral elec­tion, Malaysia’s 15th, un­der the ban­ner of the four-party Barisan Na­sional coali­tion that it leads.</p>
    <p>“We have a big­ger agenda and we can­not let Umno lose in GE15,” Mr Fauzi said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Umno is also push­ing PM Muhyid­din to hold the na­tional polls by the end of March, a move that has been panned even by the public as Malaysia con­tin­ues to grap­ple with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and with tens of thou­sands of peo­ple cur­rently housed in flood re­lief cen­tres.</p>
    <p>“Let Covid-19 fin­ish and the flood first, why would you do an elec­tion now. We have to dis­cuss with the Min­istry of Health Malaysia and the rel­e­vant par­ties,” the Si­nar Har­ian news­pa­per yes­ter­day re­ported Datuk Seri Ab­dul Hadi as say­ing.</p>
    <p>“We do not want to bur­den the peo­ple,” he was also quoted as say­ing.</p>
    <p>The par­ties in PN have be­gun to dis­cuss seat al­lo­ca­tion for GE15, which has also con­trib­uted to a rise in Umno-Ber­satu ten­sions. This is be­cause the Ber­satu lead­er­ship com­prises mostly pre­vi­ous Umno lead­ers, in­clud­ing those who joined Ber­satu af­ter the 2018 polls.</p>
    <p>Umno has in­sisted that it will field can­di­dates in all the con­stituen­cies it con­tested in 2018, and will not give way to Ber­satu. Umno won 55 par­lia­men­tary seats in the 2018 polls but to­day has 38 MPs left due to de­fec­tions to Ber­satu.</p>
