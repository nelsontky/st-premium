    <p>In less than a fort­night, art lovers will pace the cor­ri­dors of STPI – Cre­ative Work­shop & Gallery in groups of five, with a map to guide them through the nooks and cran­nies of the build­ing in Robert­son Quay.</p>
    <p>As they move through spa­ces such as a dark room, wood work­shop and artists’ apart­ments, they can ex­pect “en­coun­ters” de­signed by five of 10 Sin­ga­pore artists – such as Ian Woo, Yanyun Chen and Zul Mah­mod – who are or­ches­trat­ing a se­ries of ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This im­mer­sive two-hour ex­pe­ri­ence, ti­tled En­coun­ters and priced at $500 a guest, is a key part of STPI’s fund-rais­ing pro­gramme this year. The non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion’s usual an­nual gala din­ner, where over 160 guests gather in the gallery for a multi-course meal, was out of the ques­tion in the light of the pan­demic, and so the or­gan­is­ers racked their brains for a novel ap­proach to fund rais­ing.</p>
    <p>The theme of STPI’s fund-rais­ing ef­fort this year is Biome, which speaks to how the arts ecosys­tem is in­ter­con­nected in a shared cli­mate.</p>
    <p>STPI Gallery’s di­rec­tor Rita Tar­gui says: “We are all in­ter­de­pen­dent, from the artists to the in­sti­tu­tions, artists, gal­lerists and col­lec­tors. We all form this com­mu­nity, and we all need one an­other.”</p>
    <p>They are also run­ning an on­line auc­tion of more than 20 art­works and ex­pe­ri­ences, do­nated by artists and gal­leries based in South-east Asia. The re­spec­tive artists will re­ceive 30 per cent of the pro­ceeds from the auc­tion, which is on from Fri­day to Oct 25.</p>
    <p>All dona­tions will be matched by the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth’s Cul­tural Match­ing Fund and go to­wards STPI’s ex­hi­bi­tions, out­reach pro­grammes and artist res­i­den­cies, says Ms Tar­gui.</p>
    <p>STPI is one of sev­eral arts or­gan­i­sa­tions which have had to grap­ple with how to mount a fund-raiser in the mid­dle of a pan­demic. Some have post­poned these events, oth­ers have taken them on­line.</p>
    <p>The­atre com­pany Wild Rice, whose an­nual Rice Ball at the</p>
    <p>Shangri-La Ho­tel is typ­i­cally one of the high­lights of the so­cial cal­en­dar, rolled with the times and ran a vir­tual gala in­stead, set to the theme of “Mask­quer­ade”. On Oct 3, 500 guests from Sin­ga­pore and around the world logged in to a vir­tual plat­form de­vel­oped for the event.</p>
    <p>While en­joy­ing meals de­liv­ered to their doorsteps from restau­rants such as Odette and Three Em­bers, the guests min­gled in vir­tual rooms and tuned in to a live stream that re­sem­bled a tele­vi­sion show – with high­lights such as a back­stage tour by ac­tress Pam Oei and mu­si­cal numbers and comedy sketches per­formed at Wild Rice’s the­atre in Fu­nan mall. “There was a sense of oc­ca­sion – it wasn’t just a Zoom meet­ing,” says found­ing artis­tic di­rec­tor Ivan Heng.</p>
    <p>The gala event, which cost around $200,000 to pro­duce, in­volved about 80 peo­ple on stage and be­hind the scenes. It raised $650,000 from ta­ble sales, dona­tions and a silent auc­tion. In­di­vid­ual seats were avail­able at $1,000, and vir­tual ta­bles – seat­ing up to 10 – ranged from $8,000 to $25,000.</p>
    <p>The Pri­vate Mu­seum, which ran a fund-rais­ing gala on Zoom that same day, also had to think out of the box. Guests, who had paid $500 a ticket, tucked into three-course meals de­liv­ered from Flutes Restau­rant. They also took part in best­plat­ing and best-dressed con­tests, as well as a live auc­tion, fea­tur­ing works mostly by young and lo­cal artists, “to make the price palat­able and en­cour­age sup­port for lo­cal artists amid the pan­demic”, says mu­seum man­ager Aaron Teo.</p>
    <p>Aside from art­works, guests also bid for “ex­pe­ri­ences” such as a mas­ter­class and lunch with wa­ter­colour painter Ong Kim Seng.</p>
    <p>More than $150,000 was do­nated at the gala, com­pared with the $250,000 that is usu­ally raised.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo says: “It went re­ally well – much bet­ter than we had ex­pected.”</p>
    <p>There to lend their sup­port were art col­lec­tors Wong Su-Yen and Fer­min Diez, who had also loaned paint­ings by first- and sec­ond­gen­er­a­tion Sin­ga­pore artists to the mu­seum for an ex­hi­bi­tion this year.</p>
    <p>“Arts or­gan­i­sa­tions have been hard hit by the pan­demic,” says the mar­ried cou­ple in an e-mail. “Yet, it’s fair to say we could not have weath­ered the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod with­out books, mu­sic, art and movies.”</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra is tak­ing its fund-rais­ing gala on­line on Oct 23. Yueqin Ro­mance, which runs for an hour, will fea­ture a con­cert live-streamed on Zoom from the Sin­ga­pore Con­fer­ence Hall.</p>
    <p>Donors who give $2,000 or more will re­ceive wine and cook­ies, and those who con­trib­ute $10,000 and above will also re­ceive a minia­ture yueqin sou­venir.</p>
    <p>In July, the Sin­ga­pore Dance The­atre (SDT) ran a half-hour vir­tual fund-raiser where 200 guests tuned in for live per­for­mances on Zoom. One of the sil­ver lin­ings this year, says an SDT spokesman, was that it saved on rent and the cost of ca­ter­ing meals. The $250,000 it raised, af­ter tak­ing costs into ac­count, was higher than last year’s sum.</p>
    <p>Dance lovers Mar­cus Ye­ung and Ya­suko Ye­ung took part in the gala in a show of sup­port.</p>
    <p>Mr Ye­ung, chief ex­ec­u­tive of a tech in­vest­ment bank, says: “We wanted to see if we could help a bit fi­nan­cially, but, more im­por­tantly, cheer them on as well.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Ye­ung, a part-time teacher, chimes in: “To be able to see the dancers, all the fa­mil­iar faces, was re­ally won­der­ful be­cause we hadn’t seen them for such a long time.”</p>
