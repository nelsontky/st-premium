    <p>In­done­sia’s cap­i­tal has ex­tended its virus re­stric­tions by an­other two weeks from yes­ter­day to Jan 3, to pre­vent any fur­ther spikes i n coro­n­avirus cases dur­ing the hol­i­day sea­son as in­fec­tions con­tinue to rise.</p>
    <p>Jakarta, which is home to more than 10 mil­lion peo­ple, will keep ca­pac­ity and op­er­a­tion lim­its for of­fices, restau­rants and shop­ping malls un­der its tran­si­tion phase, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment from the lo­cal gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Last week, it also banned pub­lic gath­er­ings and re­quired anti­gen tests for those en­ter­ing the cap­i­tal dur­ing the hol­i­day sea­son.</p>
    <p>“We will mon­i­tor the mo­bil­ity of the pop­u­la­tion and con­trol it so that there is no trans­mis­sion, both from out­side to Jakarta and vice versa,” Gover­nor Anies Baswedan said. “It is nec­es­sary for us, es­pe­cially fam­i­lies i n Jakarta, to re­frain from do­ing hol­i­day ac­tiv­i­ties out­side the home, es­pe­cially out of Jakarta.”</p>
    <p>The warn­ing comes as re­cent Covid-19 cases have been traced to peo­ple with a his­tory of travel, pos­si­bly around the lo­cal elec­tion held on Dec 9, ac­cord­ing to yes­ter­day’s state­ment.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies dom­i­nate Jakarta’s in­fec­tion clus­ters, with more than 3,800 dur­ing the week of Dec 7 to 13, while of­fice clus­ters num­bered more than 300, it said.</p>
    <p>Jakarta is the epi­cen­tre of In­done­sia’s out­break, with 163,111 cases as at Sun­day, ris­ing 13.3 per cent over the last two weeks.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal’s iso­la­tion beds are at 85 per cent ca­pac­ity, while rooms at in­ten­sive care units (ICU) are 80 per cent full.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal gov­ern­ment plans to add more than 7,000 beds and 1,000 ICU rooms, as well as boost its health work­force to bat­tle the virus surge.</p>
