    <p>From writ­ing pro­grams to im­age-edit­ing soft­ware, these four apps make it a breeze for me to work us­ing a Mac</p>
    <p>Peo­ple al­ways go gaga over shiny new gad­gets and hard­ware. How­ever, it is usu­ally the soft­ware that ul­ti­mately dic­tates whether there is a good and in­tu­itive user ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>For that rea­son, I pre­fer macOS com­put­ers over Win­dows ma­chines.</p>
    <p>My es­tab­lished work­flow is just more ef­fi­cient on a Mac – more so these days when I am work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>Even though I have a Win­dows gam­ing rig, it is purely for gam­ing (time to up­grade to Nvidia RTX 3080, by the way). And while I have a com­pany-is­sued</p>
    <p>Win­dows lap­top, I use it only to in­put my ar­ti­cles into the com­pany’s sys­tem.</p>
    <p>I am a good ex­am­ple that you can run ev­ery­thing on a Mac.</p>
    <p>Here are my es­sen­tial pro­duc­tiv­ity apps for a work-from-home Mac set-up.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>iA Writer</p>
    <p>$44.98, avail­able on Mac App Store</p>
    <p>I don’t use Mi­crosoft Word. In­stead, I have been us­ing the writ­ing app In­for­ma­tion Ar­chi­tects (iA) Writer for many years to type out my ar­ti­cles, like this one here.</p>
    <p>Un­like Word, iA Writer does not have any rulers, for­mat­ting bars and other stuff to dis­tract you.</p>
    <p>It of­fers you just a white (or black when in Dark mode) can­vas for you to write your ar­ti­cles, craft your re­ports and code your pro­grams.</p>
    <p>It even has a Fo­cus mode that will black out ev­ery­thing else ex­cept the sen­tence or para­graph you are cur­rently work­ing on.</p>
    <p>I like the app so much that</p>
    <p>I also bought the iOS ver­sion to use on my iPhone and iPad.</p>
    <p>It is also avail­able on Win­dows and An­droid.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Pix­el­ma­tor Pro</p>
    <p>$40.98, avail­able on Mac App Store</p>
    <p>If you are tired of Adobe’s sub­scrip­tion model for its Pho­to­shop imag­ing-edit­ing suite, you should check out Pix­el­ma­tor Pro.</p>
    <p>It might not have an im­age­browser tool like Bridge that ac­com­pa­nies Pho­to­shop, but Pix­el­ma­tor Pro has all the im­ageed­it­ing tools you need and more.</p>
    <p>One key dif­fer­ence is its use of ma­chine learn­ing (ML) to en­hance your pho­tos.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, its ML En­hance fea­ture uses an ML al­go­rithm trained on mil­lions of pro­fes­sional pho­tos to give you au­to­matic en­hance­ment with one click.</p>
    <p>But I am espe­cially im­pressed with its ML Su­per Res­o­lu­tion fea­ture that al­lows you to in­crease the res­o­lu­tion of your ex­ist­ing im­ages, like what you see in movies.</p>
    <p>You can zoom in, se­lect ML Su­per Res­o­lu­tion and wit­ness a pix­e­lated area be­ing filled up with pix­els while main­tain­ing the sub­ject mat­ter.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>Par­al­lels Desk­top 16 US$79.99 (S$109) for a yearly sub­scrip­tion</p>
    <p>There will be in­stances when you need to use Win­dows apps be­cause they are not avail­able on macOS – espe­cially for com­pa­nies that have pro­pri­etary Win­dows apps.</p>
    <p>This is when a vir­tu­al­i­sa­tion soft­ware like Par­al­lels Desk­top 16 (PD16) comes in handy.</p>
    <p>With PD16, you do not need to re­boot your Mac to run Win­dows us­ing macOS’ na­tive Boot Camp app. You can start Win­dows 10 on macOS it­self and run Win­dows apps like a macOS app in the Mac en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>This lat­est ver­sion of­fers bet­ter per­for­mance and faster graph­ics. It is also op­ti­mised for the up­com­ing macOS 11 Big Sur op­er­at­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>But there is some­thing I like more than the PD16’s vir­tu­al­i­sa­tion ca­pa­bil­ity – the ac­com­pa­ny­ing Par­al­lel Tool­box.</p>
    <p>Into its fourth ver­sion, this suite of­fers around 30 short­cut tools that will in­crease your pro­duc­tiv­ity. For in­stance, it al­lows you to free me­mory, start screen record­ing and eas­ily down­load a video clip from a browser.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>Acro­nis True Im­age 2021</p>
    <p>$82 (stan­dard ver­sion for one PC)</p>
    <p>The macOS is es­sen­tially more se­cure than the Win­dows plat­form by virtue of its small mar­ket share. No hacker would want to spend time and ef­fort to tar­get a small por­tion of the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>How­ever, that does not mean the macOS is 100 per cent mal­ware- or virus-proof. It still needs to be pro­tected from cy­ber at­tacks.</p>
    <p>And Acro­nis True Im­age 2021 is one of the few se­cu­rity soft­ware that is avail­able for macOS. Its Ac­tive Pro­tec­tion mode con­tin­u­ously checks ev­ery file you open to see if it has ma­li­cious el­e­ments like ran­somware.</p>
    <p>It also fea­tures anti-virus scan for you to check your Mac any time you like or you can sched­ule a weekly scan. In ad­di­tion, it lets you back up your com­puter to an­other drive, so you can re­cover it in the event of hard drive fail­ure.</p>
    <p>On the down­side, the macOS ver­sion does not come with video­con­fer­enc­ing pro­tec­tion to pre­vent “Zoom-bomb­ing” or il­le­gal en­try into your Zoom or We­bEx meet­ings.</p>
