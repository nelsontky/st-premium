    <p>The apex court has made a rare rul­ing to grant ju­di­cial mercy to a woman with ter­mi­nal cancer by con­vert­ing her jail term of one week for con­tempt of court to a $5,000 fine.</p>
    <p>The mother of two took her case to the Court of Ap­peal af­ter she was found guilty of breach­ing court or­ders to not in­volve her chil­dren in an “ex­tremely ugly” di­vorce case.</p>
    <p>The woman has Stage 4 breast cancer, is wheel­chair-bound and weighs only 30kg.</p>
    <p>She was found by prison med­i­cal staff to be un­fit for jail time given the sever­ity of her ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Judge of Ap­peal An­drew Phang, who de­liv­ered the grounds of de­ci­sion ear­lier this month, said: “The ex­er­cise of ju­di­cial mercy, while not un­prece­dented, has only been done in ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances. For the court to ex­er­cise mercy, there must be ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances from which hu­man­i­tar­ian con­sid­er­a­tions arise, out­weigh­ing the pub­lic in­ter­ests in hav­ing the of­fender pun­ished for what he had done wrong against the law.”</p>
    <p>Lawyer Dorothy Tan ex­plained that in cases where ju­di­cial mercy is granted, the con­sid­er­a­tion of hu­man­i­tar­ian rea­sons, such as ter­mi­nal ill­ness, over­rides the need to make the ap­pro­pri­ate sen­tenc­ing mea­sures be­fit the crime.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Phang said the case was an ex­tremely ugly one where the mother waged an all-out war against her for­mer hus­band, de­spite be­ing di­ag­nosed with breast cancer af­ter she started di­vorce pro­ceed­ings.</p>
    <p>The judge said: “This included em­ploy­ing a scorched-earth pol­icy (a mil­i­tary strat­egy that seeks to de­stroy any­thing that could be use­ful to the en­emy) that in­volved util­is­ing the two chil­dren of the mar­riage as pawns in at­tack­ing their fa­ther.”</p>
    <p>He cited an ear­lier judg­ment of Fam­ily Jus­tice Courts Pre­sid­ing Judge Deb­bie Ong, who noted that the chil­dren used to have a lov­ing re­la­tion­ship with their fa­ther.</p>
    <p>But the mother had “re­lent­lessly po­larised them against their fa­ther to such an ex­tent that any re­pair of the re­la­tion­ship was not prac­ti­cally fea­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>The ex­er­cise of ju­di­cial mercy, while not un­prece­dented, has only been done in ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances. For the court to ex­er­cise mercy, there must be ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances from which hu­man­i­tar­ian con­sid­er­a­tions arise, out­weigh­ing the pub­lic in­ter­ests in hav­ing the of­fender pun­ished for what he had done wrong against the law.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who are in their late 40s and early 50s, have two chil­dren – a daugh­ter, 15, and a son, nine.</p>
    <p>The woman’s male col­league, who her for­mer hus­band ac­cused of be­ing her lover, moved in with the woman and her chil­dren, pur­port­edly to help her with cancer treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Ong found that the woman had ac­tively al­lowed her col­league to ma­nip­u­late the chil­dren against their fa­ther.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther took his for­mer wife to task for con­tempt of court for breach­ing court or­ders. These included get­ting both par­ents to not make dis­parag­ing re­marks about the other par­ent to the chil­dren, and not in­volve the chil­dren in the di­vorce lit­i­ga­tion, such as show­ing or dis­cussing with them any court doc­u­ments or cor­re­spon­dences re­lated to the case.</p>
    <p>Yet, their daugh­ter had posted a series of al­le­ga­tions on so­cial me­dia which were “al­ready proven to have been un­founded”, Jus­tice Phang said.</p>
    <p>In her posts, the daugh­ter named her fa­ther, and ac­cused him of be­ing a “mega per­vert” who had af­fairs and sex­u­ally groomed his chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Ong found that the woman had in­ten­tion­ally breached court or­ders not to dis­close to the chil­dren in­for­ma­tion re­lat­ing to the case in court.</p>
    <p>The woman ap­pealed against the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>In his grounds of de­ci­sion, Judge Phang said: “Hav­ing con­sid­ered the facts and the ev­i­dence as a whole, we found that the ap­pel­lant had de­lib­er­ately acted in or­der to prej­u­dice and harm the hus­band’s rep­u­ta­tion, as well as to drive a wedge in the re­la­tion­ship be­tween him and the chil­dren.”</p>
    <p>He noted that the mother was pre­vi­ously fined for con­tempt of court, af­ter re­fus­ing to hand the chil­dren over to their fa­ther for him to spend time with them as di­rected by the court. But she re­fused to pay the $3,000 fine and the court or­dered that the sum be taken out of her share of the mat­ri­mo­nial as­sets.</p>
    <p>The woman’s lawyers for the ap­peal were Mr Ushan Pre­maratne and Mr Lim Toon Joo.</p>
    <p>The fa­ther was rep­re­sented by Ms Luna Yap.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the $5,000 fine, the Court of Ap­peal also or­dered the woman to pay her for­mer hus­band $21,000 for the cost of the ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran fam­ily lawyers, such as Ms Ellen Lee and Mr Koh Tien Hua, said that, as far as they know, this is the first di­vorce-re­lated case where ju­di­cial mercy has been granted.</p>
