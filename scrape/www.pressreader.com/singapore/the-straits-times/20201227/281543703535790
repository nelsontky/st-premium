    <p>De­tails of how re­li­gious ser­vices can be con­ducted safely as the max­i­mum size of con­gre­gants is in­creased to 250 in phase three, which starts to­mor­row, were an­nounced by the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth yesterday.</p>
    <p>At present, re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions can hold con­gre­ga­tional and other wor­ship ser­vices for up to 100 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>From to­mor­row, live per­for­mance el­e­ments for con­gre­ga­tional and other wor­ship ser­vices, as well as re­li­gious rites, will be per­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try will be made manda­tory for places of wor­ship and other pub­lic premises by early next year, af­ter ev­ery­one has had the chance to col­lect the TraceTo­gether to­ken.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions must pre­pare to ac­cept check-ins by the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken, said MCCY.</p>
    <p>For con­gre­ga­tional ser­vices, wor­ship­pers have to be seg­re­gated into zones each hold­ing a max­i­mum of 50 peo­ple. Zones must be com­pletely sep­a­rated from one an­other through ei­ther a wall-to-wall par­ti­tion that is at least 1.8m high, or a space of at least 3m that is de­mar­cated by con­tin­u­ous phys­i­cal bar­ri­ers such as ropes.</p>
    <p>En­trance and exit tim­ings must also be stag­gered so that wor­ship­pers from dif­fer­ent zones do not mix with one an­other, said MCCY.</p>
    <p>“Re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions must also take rea­son­able steps to en­sure that wor­ship­pers do not cross the phys­i­cal bar­rier, where ap­pli­ca­ble, or enter an­other zone that they are not as­signed to.”</p>
    <p>It added that they must keep wor­ship ser­vices as short as pos­si­ble, and that ev­ery­one present, ex­cept chil­dren be­low six, must wear a mask at all times. “There must be no re­cep­tion or min­gling be­tween wor­ship­pers be­fore, dur­ing or af­ter each wor­ship ser­vice,” it said.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the larger ser­vices, up to 150 ad­di­tional peo­ple can par­tic­i­pate in other per­mit­ted re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties, such as re­li­gious rites and classes, on the premises at the same time. This is an in­crease from the cur­rent limit of 100 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>These gath­er­ings must not ex­ceed 50 peo­ple per group and need to have safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>“Re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions should con­sider re­duc­ing other con­cur­rent ac­tiv­i­ties when con­gre­ga­tional and other wor­ship ser­vices are on­go­ing, so that there is a smaller to­tal num­ber of peo­ple on the premises at any one time, which will help to min­imise the risk of large clus­ters from form­ing,” said MCCY.</p>
    <p>For the live per­for­mance el­e­ments, up to 10 peo­ple in­volved in con­duct­ing the wor­ship ser­vice are al­lowed to re­move their masks at a time, of whom up to five peo­ple can re­move their masks to sing.</p>
    <p>They should do so only when they need to carry out their du­ties.</p>
    <p>Be­sides those al­lowed to re­move their masks for singing, other wor­ship­pers are not al­lowed to sing dur­ing the wor­ship ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“Re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions are en­cour­aged to con­tinue sup­port­ing the re­li­gious needs of their com­mu­ni­ties via re­mote means such as record­ing and broad­cast of re­li­gious ser­vices and prayers,” said MCCY.</p>
    <p>These or­gan­i­sa­tions need to sub­mit their safe man­age­ment plans, in­clud­ing plans for man­power de­ploy­ment, at least three days be­fore com­menc­ing phase three ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>They can go to www.cpro.gov.sg for more in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>They may only con­tinue with re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties per­mit­ted un­der phase two pa­ram­e­ters if they have not sub­mit­ted their plans af­ter to­mor­row.</p>
