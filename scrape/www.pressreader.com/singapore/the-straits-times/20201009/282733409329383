    <p>• Pop su­per­star Tay­lor Swift (left) on Wed­nes­day threw her sup­port be­hind United States pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den, telling her 200 mil­lion-plus so­cial me­dia or­bit that the Demo­cratic nom­i­nee will start a “heal­ing process” in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The singer-song­writer has lashed out be­fore at US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, in­clud­ing in Au­gust when she blasted his “in­ef­fec­tive lead­er­ship” against the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and his ef­forts to “sub­vert and de­stroy” US vot­ing rights.</p>
    <p>But her re­marks in a mag­a­zine ar­ti­cle that she posted on In­sta­gram and Twit­ter were her first for­mal dec­la­ra­tion of sup­port for Mr Bi­den, a for­mer US vicepres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In V Mag­a­zine’s “Thought Lead­ers” is­sue, Swift – who has re­leased two No. 1 al­bums, Lover and Folklore, since last year – said: “Ev­ery­one de­serves a gov­ern­ment that takes global health risks se­ri­ously and puts the lives of its peo­ple first.</p>
    <p>“I will proudly vote for Joe Bi­den and Ka­mala Har­ris in this year’s pres­i­den­tial elec­tion,” she added. “Un­der their lead­er­ship, I be­lieve Amer­ica has a chance to start the heal­ing process it so des­per­ately needs.”</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old artist quickly re­ceived shout-outs from Mr Bi­den and his run­ning mate Ms Har­ris.</p>
    <p>“Tay­lor – thanks for your sup­port and for speak­ing out at this cru­cial moment in our na­tion’s his­tory,” Mr Bi­den tweeted.</p>
    <p>Swift made waves in 2018 when she en­dorsed Demo­cratic can­di­dates in her home state of Ten­nessee and said the vot­ing record of Mrs Mar­sha Blackburn, the Repub­li­can US Se­nate can­di­date, “ap­pals and ter­ri­fies me”.</p>
    <p>“I can­not vote for some­one who will not be will­ing to fight for dig­nity for all Amer­i­cans, no mat­ter their skin colour, gen­der or who they love,” Swift said at the time.</p>
    <p>Mrs Blackburn won the Se­nate elec­tion in Ten­nessee that year.</p>
