    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The top US diplo­mat i n China, Mr Terry Branstad, is re­tir­ing, the Amer­i­can Em­bassy con­firmed yes­ter­day, after Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump touted the for­mer Iowa gov­er­nor’s ex­pected campaign help in a key swing state.</p>
    <p>The em­bassy’s state­ment re­solved hours of un­cer­tainty about Mr Branstad’s sta­tus after Sec­re­tary of State Michael Pom­peo thanked the en­voy for his ser­vice in a se­ries of tweets, with­out ex­plic­itly say­ing whether he was re­sign­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Branstad was plan­ning to leave Bei­jing early next month and re­turn to Iowa, the em­bassy said.</p>
    <p>“Branstad’s de­par­ture would be a loss to China-US diplo­macy as it would mean one less po­lit­i­cal heavy­weight with a deep un­der­stand­ing of China based here,” said Mr Wang Huiyao, an ad­viser to China’s Cab­i­net and founder of the Cen­tre for China and Glob­al­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“My im­pres­sion of Branstad from be­ing at the same events is that he is some­one who ac­tively tried to ease China-US ten­sions. His de­par­ture would be a loss to fur­ther­ing bi­lat­eral re­la­tions.”</p>
    <p>Over the weekend, Mr Trump had said Mr Branstad would re­turn to the US while prais­ing the campaign ef­forts of the am­bas­sador’s son, Eric Branstad.</p>
    <p>Mr Branstad, a for­mer long­time Iowa gov­er­nor, had been cho­sen as en­voy in part be­cause of his fa­mil­iar­ity with Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, who vis­ited the Mid­west­ern US state dur­ing a trip abroad in 1985.</p>
    <p>China had praised his ap­point­ment, hail­ing Mr Branstad as an “old friend of the Chi­nese peo­ple”, a moniker re­served for a se­lect few states­man cred­ited with im­prov­ing Bei­jing’s ties with the wider world.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Mr Branstad has presided over the most con­tentious pe­riod since the two coun­tries es­tab­lished diplo­matic re­la­tions more than 40 years ago, in­clud­ing tit-for-tat con­sulate clo­sures and re­stric­tions on diplo­mats.</p>
    <p>“Am­bas­sador Branstad has con­trib­uted to re­bal­anc­ing US-China re­la­tions so that it is re­sults-ori­ented, re­cip­ro­cal, and fair,” Mr Pom­peo said in a tweet.</p>
    <p>“This will have last­ing, pos­i­tive ef­fects on US for­eign pol­icy in the Asia-Pa­cific for decades to come.”</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, Mr Branstad said: “I am ex­tremely hon­oured to rep­re­sent the Pres­i­dent of the United States and the Amer­i­can peo­ple for more than three years. We are re­bal­anc­ing the US-China re­la­tion­ship to make it fair, re­cip­ro­cal and to pro­mote pos­i­tive growth in both coun­tries. This ef­fort will con­tinue.</p>
    <p>“As I leave of­fice, I am as op­ti­mistic as when I ar­rived. I have met so many amaz­ing peo­ple in China. My wife Chris and I will never for­get your hospi­tal­ity.”</p>
    <p>LOSS TO DIPLO­MACY</p>
    <p>Branstad’s de­par­ture would be a loss to China-US diplo­macy as it would mean one less po­lit­i­cal heavy­weight with a deep un­der­stand­ing of China based here... My im­pres­sion of Branstad from be­ing at the same events is that he is some­one who ac­tively tried to ease China-US ten­sions.</p>
