    <p>NEW YORK • The surg­ing pan­demic is stok­ing fears of a fresh down­turn for the world econ­omy, heap­ing pres­sure on cen­tral banks and gov­ern­ments to lay aside other con­cerns and do more to spur de­mand.</p>
    <p>Hopes are mount­ing that Covid-19 vac­cines will be­come avail­able as soon as next month, but wide­spread de­liv­ery will take months and in­fec­tions are ris­ing again i n many large economies. The au­thor­i­ties around the world are re­spond­ing with more re­stric­tions to limit the virus spread at the price of weaker eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Wall Street economists now say it will not take much for the United States, euro area and Ja­pan to each con­tract again ei­ther this quar­ter or the next, just months af­ter they bounced from the deep­est re­ces­sion in gen­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Bloomberg Eco­nom­ics gauges of high-fre­quency data point to a dou­ble-dip down­turn, with Euro­pean fac­tory in­dexes on Mon­day jus­ti­fy­ing that worry, though a US mea­sure of busi­ness ac­tiv­ity was up­beat.</p>
    <p>That leaves pol­i­cy­mak­ers hear­ing calls for more stim­u­lus, even when cen­tral banks are al­ready stretched and start­ing to worry about froth in fi­nan­cial mar­kets.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, politi­cians from the US to Europe are clash­ing over just how much they can and should do with fis­cal pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“While there is much ex­cite­ment over the progress of vac­cine de­vel­op­ment, it will not be the quick fix that many ex­pect it to be,” Sin­ga­pore’s Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing told re­porters on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“Man­u­fac­tur­ing enough doses, then dis­tribut­ing and vac­ci­nat­ing a sig­nif­i­cant pop­u­la­tion of the world, will take many months, if not years.”</p>
    <p>Against such a back­drop, the Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank (ECB) is set to ease mon­e­tary pol­icy again next month, while the US Fed­eral Re­serve could con­cen­trate more of its bond pur­chases on longer-term se­cu­ri­ties to push down in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>But there are con­cerns the cen­tral banks have run out of room to act de­ci­sively and that even eas­ier fi­nan­cial con­di­tions will not trans­late into an eco­nomic boost. The In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) is among those also warn­ing that el­e­vated as­set prices po­ten­tially point to a dis­con­nect from the real econ­omy and so may pose a fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity threat.</p>
    <p>For­mer Fed chair Janet Yellen, who is set to be nom­i­nated for Trea­sury Sec­re­tary by US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den, told Bloomberg’s New Econ­omy Fo­rum last week the core prob­lem fac­ing de­vel­oped economies is that “there is a glut of sav­ings and a short­age of in­vest­ment”.</p>
    <p>“We have to have fis­cal pol­icy, struc­tural pol­icy other than just re­ly­ing on cen­tral banks to achieve healthy growth,” she said.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is fis­cal pol­icy in the US and Europe is not rac­ing to the res­cue. Law­mak­ers in the US are at log­ger­heads over how much more to spend as Mr Bi­den pre­pares to take of­fice.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s Trea­sury De­part­ment last week re­duced the Fed’s abil­ity to aid some credit mar­kets.</p>
    <p>In Europe, US$2 tril­lion (S$2.7 tril­lion) in aid is be­ing held up by a fight over po­lit­i­cal con­trol.</p>
    <p>AXA chief econ­o­mist Gilles Moec said: “Ex­actly at the time cen­tral banks ev­ery­where are ac­knowl­edg­ing the cen­tral­ity of fis­cal pol­icy in deal­ing with the eco­nomic con­se­quences of the pan­demic, gov­ern­ments are fac­ing dif­fi­cul­ties in im­ple­ment­ing the next leg of their stim­u­lus.”</p>
    <p>In the US, the pace of in­fec­tions prompted JPMor­gan Chase & Co an­a­lysts to fore­cast an eco­nomic shrink­age in the next quar­ter as var­i­ous states im­pose so­cial dis­tanc­ing curbs and some gov­ern­ment ben­e­fits ex­pire. Re­cent data showed more peo­ple fil­ing for un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits and fewer din­ing out at restau­rants.</p>
    <p>Dal­las Fed pres­i­dent Robert Ka­plan told Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion last week: “It is pos­si­ble we could have neg­a­tive growth if this resur­gence gets bad enough and mo­bil­ity falls off enough.”</p>
    <p>In Europe, fur­ther ev­i­dence ar­rived on Mon­day that a dou­ble-dip re­ces­sion is on the way, with a sur­vey of pur­chas­ing man­agers drop­ping sharply.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s man­u­fac­tur­ing and ser­vice sec­tors wors­ened at a faster pace this month, early pur­chas­ing man­agers’ in­dexes showed, adding to con­cern over the strength of the re­cov­ery. Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga has called for a third ex­tra bud­get to keep the econ­omy on a growth path.</p>
    <p>Both the IMF and the Group of 20 (G-20) – which com­prises the world’s rich­est na­tions – warned dur­ing the G-20 meet­ings last week­end that the re­cov­ery is at risk of de­rail­ing de­spite pos­i­tive news around vac­cines buoy­ing global stocks.</p>
    <p>China is the world’s only ma­jor econ­omy tipped to grow this year as the gov­ern­ment’s early con­trol of the virus al­lowed lock­downs to be eased months ago. While the coun­try’s trade-led re­cov­ery is of­fer­ing a boost to global com­merce for now, even it is vul­ner­a­ble to the global out­look.</p>
    <p>RE­AL­ITY CHECK</p>
    <p>Fed chair Jerome Pow­ell and ECB pres­i­dent Chris­tine La­garde are among the cen­tral bankers warn­ing against ex­u­ber­ance on news of suc­cess­ful vac­cine tri­als.</p>
    <p>The main rea­son for cau­tion is the time needed to roll out shots for the world’s pop­u­la­tion to an ex­tent en­abling an end to growth-sap­ping move­ment re­stric­tions. The an­nounce­ment of a vac­cine it­self may drive mar­ket op­ti­mism, but does not re­open economies for now.</p>
    <p>“The vac­cine gives more of a vi­sion for what may be late next year, and what 2022 will look like, but not for the next six months,” ECB chief econ­o­mist Philip Lane said in an in­ter­view with Les Echos.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion will not ma­te­ri­ally im­prove in the last weeks of 2020.”</p>
    <p>The ECB’s down­beat tone on the im­me­di­ate out­look is the back­drop to the likely ar­rival of a boost to the cen­tral bank’s €1.35 tril­lion (S$2.2 tril­lion) emer­gency bond­buy­ing pro­gramme and its cheap bank loans. Pol­i­cy­mak­ers meet on Dec 10.</p>
    <p>The worst af­fected sec­tors con­tinue to shed jobs as com­pa­nies warn on profits. Boe­ing is al­most dou­bling its planned job cuts while Adi­das be­came one of the first con­sumer goods com­pa­nies in Europe to warn that re­newed lock­downs will weigh on its earn­ings again and bring a swift end to a re­cent sales re­bound.</p>
    <p>JPMor­gan an­a­lysts are hope­ful that a vac­cine and another round of fis­cal sup­port to­talling US$1 tril­lion in the US will be enough to de­liver av­er­age growth of more than 5 per cent in the mid­dle quar­ters of next year. Even then, the virus’ lega­cies of record debt and el­e­vated un­em­ploy­ment will en­dure.</p>
    <p>Economists at ABN Amro Group, how­ever, see mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions around the world last­ing well into 2022.</p>
    <p>“Only then can the global econ­omy break into a growth spurt to make up the lost out­put ver­sus trend growth,” an­a­lysts, in­clud­ing chief econ­o­mist San­dra Ph­lip­pen, wrote in a re­port on Mon­day. “The vac­cine is tan­ta­lis­ingly close, but still out of reach.”</p>
