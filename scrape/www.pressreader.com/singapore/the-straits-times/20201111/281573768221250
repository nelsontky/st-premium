    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump was set to push ahead with le­gal chal­lenges to the re­sults of the elec­tion af­ter At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr (right) told fed­eral prose­cu­tors to look into any “sub­stan­tial” al­le­ga­tions of vot­ing ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties. Mr Barr’s di­rec­tive prompted the top lawyer over­see­ing voter fraud probes to re­sign in protest.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump was set to push ahead yes­ter­day with le­gal chal­lenges to the re­sults of last week’s elec­tion af­ter US At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr told fed­eral prose­cu­tors to look into any “sub­stan­tial” al­le­ga­tions of vot­ing ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr’s di­rec­tive to prose­cu­tors prompted the top lawyer over­see­ing voter fraud in­ves­ti­ga­tions to re­sign in protest.</p>
    <p>It came af­ter days of at­tacks on the in­tegrity of the elec­tion by Mr Trump and Repub­li­can al­lies, who have al­leged wide­spread voter fraud, with­out pro­vid­ing ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has not con­ceded the elec­tion to Demo­crat Joe Bi­den, who last Satur­day got more than the 270 elec­toral col­lege votes needed to win the pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign has filed sev­eral law­suits claim­ing the elec­tion re­sults were flawed. Judges have al­ready tossed out law­suits in Michi­gan and Ge­or­gia, and ex­perts say Mr Trump’s le­gal ef­forts have lit­tle chance of chang­ing the elec­tion re­sult.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral of the law­suits claim the Trump cam­paign was not given suf­fi­cient ac­cess or a close enough view to mon­i­tor vote count­ing and catch any fraud­u­lent bal­lots.</p>
    <p>Mr Barr told prose­cu­tors on Mon­day that “fan­ci­ful or far-fetched claims” should not be a ba­sis for in­ves­ti­ga­tion and his let­ter did not in­di­cate that the Jus­tice De­part­ment had un­cov­ered vot­ing ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties af­fect­ing the out­come of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing here should be taken as any in­di­ca­tion that the de­part­ment has con­cluded that vot­ing ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties have im­pacted the out­come of any elec­tion,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>But he did say he was au­tho­ris­ing prose­cu­tors to “pur­sue sub­stan­tial al­le­ga­tions” of ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties of vot­ing and the count­ing of bal­lots.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the elec­tion, Mr Barr had echoed Mr Trump’s un­sup­ported claims that wide­spread use of mail-in bal­lots was sub­ject to fraud, in­clud­ing bal­lots that might be cast by for­eign ad­ver­saries seek­ing to in­flu­ence the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral had re­mained silent in the days just be­fore and af­ter last week’s elec­tion, un­til now.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Pil­ger, who for years has served as direc­tor of the Elec­tion Crimes Branch, an­nounced in an in­ter­nal e-mail that he was re­sign­ing from his post af­ter he read “the new pol­icy and its ram­i­fi­ca­tions”.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign said Mr Barr was fu­elling Mr Trump’s far­fetched al­le­ga­tions of fraud.</p>
    <p>“Those are the very kind of claims that the Pres­i­dent and his lawyers are mak­ing un­suc­cess­fully ev­ery day, as their law­suits are laughed out of one court af­ter an­other,” said Mr Bob Bauer, a se­nior ad­viser to Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Bi­den’s tran­si­tion team was con­sid­er­ing le­gal ac­tion over a fed­eral agency’s de­lay in recog­nis­ing the Demo­crat’s vic­tory over Mr Trump in last week’s elec­tion, an of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>The Gen­eral Ser­vices Ad­min­is­tra­tion (GSA) nor­mally recog­nises a pres­i­den­tial can­di­date when it be­comes clear who has won an elec­tion so that a tran­si­tion of power can be­gin.</p>
    <p>“Le­gal ac­tion is cer­tainly a pos­si­bil­ity, but there are other op­tions as well that we’re con­sid­er­ing,” said the of­fi­cial, who spoke on con­di­tion of anonymity, de­clin­ing to out­line other op­tions.</p>
    <p>The de­lay is cost­ing the Bi­den team ac­cess to mil­lions of dol­lars in fed­eral fund­ing and the abil­ity to meet of­fi­cials at in­tel­li­gence agen­cies and other de­part­ments.</p>
    <p>The tran­si­tion team needs to be recog­nised to ac­cess funds for salaries, con­sul­tants and travel, as well as ac­cess to clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion, the of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the team has no ac­cess to the State De­part­ment, which usu­ally fa­cil­i­tates calls be­tween for­eign lead­ers and the pres­i­dent-elect, the of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>That has not yet hap­pened de­spite US tele­vi­sion and news net­works declar­ing Mr Bi­den the win­ner last Satur­day af­ter he won enough elec­toral col­lege votes to se­cure the pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>The law does not clearly spell out when the GSA must act, but Mr Bi­den’s tran­si­tion of­fi­cials say their vic­tory is clear and a de­lay is not jus­ti­fied, even as Mr Trump re­fuses to con­cede de­feat.</p>
    <p>GSA ad­min­is­tra­tor Emily Mur­phy, ap­pointed by Mr Trump in 2017, has not yet de­ter­mined that “a win­ner is clear”, a spokesman said.</p>
