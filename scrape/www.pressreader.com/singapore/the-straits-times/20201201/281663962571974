    <p>The pub­lic Lee fam­ily feud over the fate of their 38 Ox­ley Road home is one-sided, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, adding that nei­ther he nor his wife Ho Ching held any an­i­mos­ity to­wards his sib­lings.</p>
    <p>It also emerged dur­ing day one of PM Lee’s defama­tion suit against The On­line Ci­ti­zen (TOC) ed­i­tor Terry Xu yes­ter­day that his sib­lings – Mr Lee Hsien Yang and Dr Lee Wei Ling – would not be tes­ti­fy­ing in court.</p>
    <p>Asked by Mr Xu’s lawyer Lim Tean if there was a sour re­la­tion­ship be­tween Ms Ho and his sib­lings, PM Lee said: “I think the an­i­mos­ity is ev­i­dent on one side, from my sib­lings... Nei­ther I nor my wife re­ally want this to con­tinue or to hold any­thing against them.”</p>
    <p>The feud, he stressed, was on his sib­lings’ part.</p>
    <p>“I do not un­der­stand what it is about,” said PM Lee. “I have de­tached my­self from the cause of the feud. I no longer own 38 Ox­ley Road, I have sold it to my brother. I have re­cused my­self from the Gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of the case com­pletely, and I have noth­ing to do with any de­ci­sion the Gov­ern­ment makes on 38 Ox­ley Road.</p>
    <p>“There­fore, there is re­ally noth­ing I can do or not do to in­flu­ence the mat­ter. It vexes them… whether or not to knock the house down.</p>
    <p>“We don’t un­der­stand this con­tin­u­ing an­i­mos­ity and re­peated state­ments, pub­licly (through) Face­book posts. I have never done any Face­book post. I have not crit­i­cised them pub­licly other than what I put out in my min­is­te­rial state­ments.</p>
    <p>“And I hope against hope that one day, mat­ters may be re­paired. But it is one of those things that hap­pen in life, and this too shall pass.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim also asked if it was cor­rect that PM Lee had asked his wife how quickly he could move into 38 Ox­ley Road, a day be­fore Mr Lee Kuan Yew died when the fam­ily was gath­ered at the home.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said he thought that was un­true.</p>
    <p>“I can­not re­mem­ber the con­ver­sa­tion, but I do not be­lieve I would have said such a thing. But the coun­sel, if I may point out, could have sub­poe­naed peo­ple who could con­firm that state­ment... namely my sib­lings. He has not done so.”</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber last year, Mr Xu ap­plied to bring PM Lee’s sib­lings into the suit as third par­ties, with the in­ten­tion of hav­ing them bear dam­ages if he was found to have de­famed PM Lee. He said the TOC ar­ti­cle merely quoted di­rectly from pub­lic com­ments made by Dr Lee and Mr Lee Hsien Yang, and that they would have knowl­edge of par­tic­u­lars re­lat­ing to the truth of the al­le­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Lim said Mr Xu would dis­con­tinue any third-party in­volve­ment and pro­ceed­ings, thus rul­ing out the pos­si­bil­ity of the sib­lings tes­ti­fy­ing in court.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim also asked PM Lee if he had fore­seen that a con­flict would arise be­tween him and his sib­lings over what to do with the 38 Ox­ley Road house.</p>
    <p>He told the court that it was his client’s con­tention that, de­spite PM Lee’s pub­lic state­ments on his po­si­tion, the Prime Min­is­ter did not ac­tu­ally want the house de­mol­ished and had his own mo­tives.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said that while it was Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s per­sonal pref­er­ence to have the house de­mol­ished, his fa­ther had also ac­knowl­edged the pos­si­bil­ity that the Gov­ern­ment might move to pre­vent this and thus made ar­range­ments to pre­serve the fam­ily’s pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>He added that even when “putting aside the pos­si­bil­ity that we would not agree”, it would have been dif­fi­cult for him­self and his sib­lings to go against pub­lic pres­sure to pre­serve the house.</p>
    <p>Be­sides that, PM Lee said it was also his po­si­tion that it would be un­ten­able if the three sib­lings were to ben­e­fit fi­nan­cially from any de­ci­sion to de­mol­ish and re­de­velop the prop­erty.</p>
    <p>He said he had sug­gested to his sib­lings that any pro­ceeds from such a de­ci­sion should be do­nated to a suit­able char­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim noted that while his sib­lings were in­sis­tent on knock­ing the house down, he seemed to have doubts and hes­i­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>To that, PM Lee re­sponded that he had doubts about whether de­mo­li­tion would be pos­si­ble, given the pub­lic sen­ti­ment in favour of pre­serv­ing it.</p>
