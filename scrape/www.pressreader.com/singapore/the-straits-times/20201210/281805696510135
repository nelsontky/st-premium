    <p>The shut­ting down of par­ody Twit­ter ac­count BermanaTV has raised con­cerns among hu­man rights groups in Malaysia, which claim that the sus­pen­sion of par­o­d­i­cal and satir­i­cal sites fits the alarm­ing pat­tern of in­creased cen­sor­ship and re­stric­tions on free­dom of ex­pres­sion im­posed by the Malaysian gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Rights ac­tivists said the move en­croaches on free­dom of speech, and that the au­thor­i­ties and so­cial me­dia giants like Twit­ter should recog­nise these sites as satire.</p>
    <p>Amnesty In­ter­na­tional Malaysia’s ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ka­t­rina Jorene Maliamauv said free­dom of ex­pres­sion is guar­an­teed un­der the Fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion and is a fun­da­men­tal hu­man right.</p>
    <p>“Hu­mour is a form of ex­pres­sion, par­ody and satire are of­ten tools for so­cial com­men­tary – that peo­ple in power may not en­joy it is no rea­son to crush our right to ex­pres­sion,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“It is shame­ful and shock­ing that MCMC is us­ing its power to shut down satir­i­cal sites,” she said, re­fer­ring to the Malaysian Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and Mul­ti­me­dia Com­mis­sion (MCMC).</p>
    <p>“We urge them in­stead to fo­cus on ad­dress­ing ac­tual threats of ha­rass­ment and in­tim­i­da­tion, trolling and hate speech faced by mem­bers of the pub­lic on so­cial me­dia.”</p>
    <p>BermanaTV, which pokes fun at Malaysia’s na­tional news agency Ber­nama, was sus­pended by Twit­ter last week af­ter a com­plaint was filed by the In­ter­net reg­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>The ac­count, which used the han­dle @Ber­manadot­con, was sus­pended by the mi­croblog­ging site for vi­o­lat­ing its com­mu­nity stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers said this sig­nals a pos­si­ble crack­down on other spoof ac­counts by the com­mis­sion, which said these sites de­liver false news that mock or in­sult, and could con­fuse the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The hu­man rights groups are urg­ing the pub­lic to sign a pe­ti­tion call­ing for the gov­ern­ment to re­peal Sec­tion 233 of the Mul­ti­me­dia and Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Act, and three other laws of­ten used to re­strict free­dom of ex­pres­sion in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Shar­ing of of­fen­sive and men­ac­ing con­tent is an of­fence un­der Sec­tion 233, which car­ries a max­i­mum fine of RM50,000 (S$16,440) or a jail term not ex­ceed­ing one year, or both.</p>
    <p>The re­cent Peo­ple Power Un­der</p>
    <p>At­tack 2020 an­nual re­port by Civi­cus Mon­i­tor found that civic space re­mains “ob­structed” in Malaysia, as the ma­jor­ity of coun­tries in Asia re­press civic free­doms.</p>
    <p>It noted that “fol­low­ing the change of gov­ern­ment in early March 2020, ac­tivists in­clud­ing stu­dents have faced ju­di­cial ha­rass­ment from the po­lice for their ac­tivism”, and jour­nal­ists in Malaysia have been ha­rassed by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Sun­day, the MCMC al­leged that “fake ac­counts are pur­posely cre­ated to pro­tect the true iden­tity (of the ac­count owner), to lie, cre­ate con­fu­sion or di­vide the com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>While it ap­pre­ci­ates the ac­tion taken by Twit­ter fol­low­ing its com­plaint, the agency said the sus­pen­sion or shut­ting down of BermanaTV is a re­ac­tive and tem­po­rary mea­sure.</p>
    <p>“MCMC will con­tinue to re­mind the pub­lic to be cau­tious with the ex­is­tence of fake ac­counts in so­cial me­dia that have bad in­ten­tions,” it said.</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion as well as Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and Mul­ti­me­dia Min­is­ter Sai­fud­din Ab­dul­lah have not re­sponded to The Straits Times’ re­quests for com­ment.</p>
