    <p>The race for seats in Hong Kong’s Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (Legco) is heat­ing up, with the pro-es­tab­lish­ment and op­po­si­tion camps un­veil­ing their can­di­dates against the back­drop of a tough new na­tional se­cu­rity law im­posed by Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Among those who topped the op­po­si­tion’s pri­mary polls was ac­tivist Joshua Wong, who an­nounced his win in Kowloon East district on so­cial me­dia yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He promised to “bring Hong Kongers’ voices to the world” and said he ex­pected more po­lit­i­cal cen­sor­ship and dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion of pan­demo­cratic can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>“It may be the last free elec­tion for Hong Kongers, but it marks our real strug­gle for free­doms in the city,” the young ac­tivist said in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>Vot­ers in the un­of­fi­cial pri­maries de­cide on the pan-demo­cratic can­di­dates to be fielded in the Sept 6 Legco elec­tion.</p>
    <p>This time round, younger ac­tivists and lo­cal­ists have made up the new crop of op­po­si­tion can­di­dates. They came out on top in the pri­maries against the vet­er­ans, in­clud­ing in­cum­bent Demo­cratic Party law­maker He­lena Wong.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong yes­ter­day ad­mit­ted fail­ing to make the cut in Kowloon West, adding that she re­spected the de­ci­sion of vot­ers and would not com­pete in the Septem­ber vote.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, pre­lim­i­nary re­sults of the op­po­si­tion camp were leaked, forc­ing the or­gan­is­ers of the un­of­fi­cial pri­maries to re­lease re</p>
    <p>STRUG­GLE FOR FREE­DOM</p>
    <p>It may be the last free elec­tion for Hong Kongers, but it marks our real strug­gle for free­doms in the city. ’’</p>
    <p>AC­TIVIST JOSHUA WONG, on Face­book.</p>
    <p>sults. All the can­di­dates are ex­pected to meet the press to­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the city’s largest proBei­jing party, the Demo­cratic Al­liance for the Bet­ter­ment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), called the up­com­ing elec­tion the most chal­leng­ing one in its his­tory.</p>
    <p>Party chair Starry Lee is set to run for the “su­per” seat, with Kwun Tong district coun­cil­lor Frankie Ngan sec­ond on the bal­lot.</p>
    <p>Su­per seats were in­tro­duced in 2012 to im­prove the func­tional con­stituen­cies, the bulk of which are elected by vot­ers from their re­spec­tive pro­fes­sional or trade sec­tors such as tourism and fi­nance.</p>
    <p>There are five su­per seats out of the 35 seats in the func­tional con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers seek­ing re-elec­tion in­clude Mr Ho­race Che­ung (Hong Kong Is­land), Mr Vin­cent Cheng (Kowloon West) and Ms El­iz­a­beth Quat (New Ter­ri­to­ries East).</p>
    <p>The DAB party holds 13 of the 70 seats in the cur­rent Legco.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee slammed the op­po­si­tion for try­ing to de­stroy Hong Kong by ve­to­ing all gov­ern­ment pro­pos­als and paralysing Legco.</p>
    <p>She said the op­po­si­tion was aim­ing to force Bei­jing into crack­ing down on the ter­ri­tory and pave the way for Western sanc­tions.</p>
