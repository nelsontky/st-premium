    <p>When Mr Chi Xiao Biao, a counter staff mem­ber at Han­shan Money Ex­press Re­mit­tance, en­coun­tered an anx­ious cus­tomer at­tempt­ing to trans­fer cash ur­gently to an over­seas bank ac­count via the com­pany’s ex­press ser­vice, he knew some­thing was amiss.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of his vig­i­lance, he man­aged to save the woman in her mid-40s from be­ing scammed of $15,000.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions sub­se­quently re­vealed she had been tricked into believ­ing that she was pay­ing a manda­tory pro­cess­ing fee in or­der to claim a $600,000 lucky draw prize.</p>
    <p>“The cus­tomer seemed ner­vous and in­sisted on (us­ing) our ex­press ser­vice to get the $15,000 re­mit­ted as fast as pos­si­ble,” said Mr Chi of the in­ci­dent which took place in May last year.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised she was be­ing coached by a scam­mer over an ac­tive WeChat voice call on ex­actly what to say to staff at the re­mit­tance com­pany, to get us to trans­fer large sums (of money) with­out ask­ing too many ques­tions.”</p>
    <p>He con­fronted the scam­mer over the phone, and the per­son hung up after a brief ar­gu­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Chi, 52, was one of 108 in­di­vid­u­als and 15 or­gan­i­sa­tions re­cently lauded by the Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment (CAD) for their con­tri­bu­tions to de­tect­ing and pre­vent­ing scams.</p>
    <p>These awards also recog­nise the closer co­op­er­a­tion be­tween com­mer­cial en­ti­ties and the au­thor­i­ties to com­bat scams.</p>
    <p>Last year, re­cip­i­ents of CAD’s Com­mu­nity Part­ner­ship Awards – which in­clude banks, re­mit­tance agen­cies and com­mer­cial en­ter­prises – in­ter­vened in 91 scam in­ci­dents in­volv­ing more than $5 mil­lion worth of po­ten­tial losses.</p>
    <p>This is com­pared with the more than $1 mil­lion in 87 scam cases in­ter­cepted in 2018.</p>
    <p>The po­lice at­tribute this in­crease in monies re­cov­ered to the swift in­ter­ven­tion of these or­gan­i­sa­tions and their close col­lab­o­ra­tion with the CAD to de­velop and im­ple­ment anti-scam mea­sures.</p>
    <p>CAD di­rec­tor David Chew said: “The Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has brought about a new nor­mal – dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of the pub­lic space. Scams have be­come more preva­lent and the Com­mu­nity Part­ner­ship Award is a tes­ta­ment that the part­ner­ship be­tween the po­lice and our com­mu­nity is im­por­tant in com­bat­ing this scam trend.”</p>
    <p>More com­plex meth­ods are also be­ing em­ployed by crim­i­nals to hood­wink their vic­tims.</p>
    <p>This was ex­actly what hap­pened in a scam thwarted by staff at OCBC Bank, where scam­mers pre­tended to be tech sup­port staff and gov­ern­ment agents.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber last year, the bank flagged a $190,000 trans­fer by a man in his 60s to a bank ac­count in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>When OCBC staff con­tacted him, his eva­sive­ness and in­sis­tence that the money was go­ing to “his cousin in Hong Kong” raised red flags.</p>
    <p>The bank man­aged to re­call the trans­ac­tion within hours and the vic­tim did not lose any money.</p>
    <p>It later came to light that the man was con­vinced by scam­mers pos­ing as Sing­tel tech sup­port staff that he had been roped into a se­cret mis­sion by the “Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Crime Depart­ment”. No such depart­ment or agency ex­ists.</p>
    <p>He was in­structed by the scam­mers to trans­fer the large sum of money im­me­di­ately, to be used as “bait” for crim­i­nals.</p>
    <p>Mr Roys­ton Soon, vice-pres­i­dent of fraud risk man­age­ment at OCBC, said: “Once money leaves the cus­tomer’s ac­count, par­tic­u­larly in the case of in­stan­ta­neous bank trans­fers, it is usu­ally an up­hill bat­tle to re­call the trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“We urge cus­tomers to stay vig­i­lant and not to share per­sonal de­tails like one-time PINs.”</p>
