    <p>The Court of Ap­peal yes­ter­day re­jected a bid by a Bri­tish drug traf­ficker to raise le­gal ques­tions re­lated to his sen­tence of 20 years’ jail and 24 strokes of the cane for two sets of drug of­fences com­mit­ted in 2016 and 2018.</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond time that Lon­don-born disc jockey Yuen Ye Ming, 31, has failed in his at­tempt to ask Sin­ga­pore’s high­est court to de­ter­mine ques­tions of law which he claims are of pub­lic in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>This time, rep­re­sented by lawyer M. Ravi, he sought to raise three is­sues, in­clud­ing whether two sep­a­rate can­ing sen­tences can be or­dered to be im­posed con­cur­rently.</p>
    <p>In dis­miss­ing Yuen’s case, Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon said the le­gal re­quire­ments for the court to al­low his ap­pli­ca­tion had not been met. Dur­ing the hear­ing, CJ Menon told Mr Ravi that the apex court has no ju­ris­dic­tion to de­ter­mine the le­gal ques­tions as they had not been de­cided by the High Court.</p>
    <p>“Our pow­ers are con­strained by statute,” said the Chief Jus­tice.</p>
    <p>The court, which also com­prised Judges of Ap­peal Ju­dith Prakash and Tay Yong Kwang, will is­sue de­tailed writ­ten grounds in due course.</p>
    <p>Yuen was first ar­rested on Aug 5, 2016 at a River Val­ley con­do­minium and found to be car­ry­ing drugs.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed that he had turned to sell­ing drugs to sup­port his lav­ish lifestyle and pay his gam­bling debts.</p>
    <p>On Jan 17, 2018, he pleaded guilty to traf­fick­ing, pos­ses­sion and con­sump­tion charges and the case was ad­journed for sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>While on bail, Yuen was ar­rested on Feb 20, 2018, and charged with a sec­ond set of traf­fick­ing, pos­ses­sion and con­sump­tion of­fences.</p>
    <p>He pleaded guilty to four of the 12 charges on July 18, 2018.</p>
    <p>On Aug 1, 2018, he was sen­tenced to a to­tal of 20 years’ im­pris­on­ment and the max­i­mum 24 strokes of the cane by a dis­trict judge.</p>
    <p>He was un­rep­re­sented when he ap­pealed to the High Court against the sen­tence. The ap­peal was dis­missed in Novem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Yuen made head­lines in Jan­uary last year af­ter his case was re­ported in Bri­tish news­pa­per Daily Mail.</p>
    <p>That month, then Bri­tish For­eign Sec­re­tary Jeremy Hunt brought up his case with For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan while he was in Sin­ga­pore for an of­fi­cial visit.</p>
    <p>Yuen then en­gaged lawyer Eu­gene Thu­raisingam to raise le­gal ques­tions to the Court of Ap­peal re­lat­ing to the en­hanced pun­ish­ment regime for drug of­fences.</p>
    <p>The ap­pli­ca­tion was heard and dis­missed in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>In March, he filed his sec­ond ap­pli­ca­tion to re­fer dif­fer­ent ques­tions to the apex court.</p>
    <p>The ques­tions, framed by Mr Ravi, re­late to is­sues of dou­ble pun­ish­ment, whether a sen­tence of can­ing may be im­posed con­cur­rently and whether manda­tory min­i­mum sen­tences in­fringe an of­fender’s right to a pro­por­tion­ate sen­tence.</p>
