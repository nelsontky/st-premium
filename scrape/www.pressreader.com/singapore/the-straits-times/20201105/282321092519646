    <p>A man con­victed of mo­lest­ing a 12-year-old girl has seen his sen­tenced re­duced on ap­peal.</p>
    <p>The man, 35, now faces two years’ jail and three strokes of the cane, as op­posed to four years and six months’ jail and six strokes of the cane that a district judge im­posed ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The man and the girl, who re­ferred to him as her step­fa­ther, can­not be named to pro­tect her iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Re­duc­ing the charge from ag­gra­vated out­rage of mod­esty to out­rage of mod­esty, Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, who heard the ap­peal, noted that the man slapped the vic­tim ten min­utes after he mo­lested her, mean­ing that he could not have done so to com­mit the of­fence.</p>
    <p>In his judg­ment re­leased yes­ter­day, the Chief Jus­tice wrote: “At the trial, the prose­cu­tion iden­ti­fied the rel­e­vant act of hurt to be the ap­pel­lant’s act of slap­ping the vic­tim twice, but it was not dis­puted that this act oc­curred ten min­utes after the of­fence of out­rage of mod­esty had been com­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>“That act could not there­fore be said to have been done in or­der to com­mit or to fa­cil­i­tate the com­mis­sion of that of­fence.”</p>
    <p>The man is the boyfriend of the girl’s mother and the fa­ther of the vic­tim’s younger half-brother. The fam­ily lived to­gether in a one-room flat.</p>
    <p>The girl tes­ti­fied ear­lier that in the early hours of Aug 28 last year, the man woke her up and she felt his hand un­der her bra on her left breast for about a minute as he ap­plied a sig­nif­i­cant amount of force.</p>
    <p>He then pulled her hair and brought her face close to his groin three or four times, but she did not see if his gen­i­tals were ex­posed as she had turned away. Ten min­utes later, he slapped her twice.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing those ten min­utes, she moved to her brother’s bed, where the man kept try­ing to touch her but stopped when her brother woke up.</p>
    <p>Later that day, she told her school coun­sel­lor about the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The Chief Jus­tice said that although the man, who rep­re­sented him­self, did not com­ply with the proper procedure to bring an ap­peal against con­vic­tion, it was al­lowed in the in­ter­ests of jus­tice.</p>
    <p>The man main­tained that he was in­no­cent.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tion had pro­posed chang­ing the ag­gra­vat­ing el­e­ment of the slap­ping of the vic­tim to the dif­fer­ent el­e­ment of wrong­ful re­straint – that of pulling her hair and of forc­ing her head to­wards the man’s groin.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this was not al­lowed as the Chief Jus­tice said it would have “changed the com­plex­ion of the case en­tirely” and there was a rea­son­able pos­si­bil­ity that the trial might have pro­ceeded dif­fer­ently had the man been tried on this pro­posed al­tered charge.</p>
    <p>There was also con­cern of po­ten­tial prej­u­dice to the man.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tion then sought to amend the charge to one of out­rage of mod­esty of a per­son un­der 14 years of age, which was al­lowed as this would not cause any prej­u­dice since it is a lesser ver­sion of the orig­i­nal charge.</p>
    <p>The man was then con­victed on this amended charge.</p>
