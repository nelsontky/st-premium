    <p>• A to­tal of 35 iconic arts venues and cul­tural or­gan­i­sa­tions in Bri­tain re­ceived an in­jec­tion of £75 mil­lion (S$133 mil­lion) from the gov­ern­ment’s Cul­ture Re­cov­ery Fund, with 70 per cent of fund­ing awarded out­side of Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Cul­ture Sec­re­tary Oliver Dow­den an­nounced the fund – which is in­tended to pro­tect some of the na­tion’s lead­ing cul­tural or­gan­i­sa­tions – last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>These in­clude Shake­speare’s Globe, Sadler’s Wells Theatre and The Old Vic in Lon­don, as well as ma­jor re­gional theatres like Sh­effield’s Cru­cible Theatre, Manch­ester’s Royal Ex­change Theatre and the Birm­ing­ham Reper­tory Theatre.</p>
    <p>Each re­cip­i­ent will get at least £1 mil­lion in the lat­est round of grants from the gov­ern­ment’s £1.57 bil­lion Cul­ture Re­cov­ery Fund.</p>
    <p>More than £52 mil­lion, or 70 per cent of the to­tal awarded this round, will go to or­gan­i­sa­tions out­side Lon­don.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish Depart­ment for Dig­i­tal, Cul­ture, Me­dia and Sport (DCMS) said the grants are be­ing awarded to places that de­fine cul­ture in all cor­ners of the coun­try by pro­vid­ing jobs, sup­port­ing the wider com­mu­nity and en­gag­ing the public through in­no­va­tive means dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It is the largest boost from the fund to date to save the coun­try’s cul­tural icons.</p>
    <p>“These places and or­gan­i­sa­tions are ir­re­place­able parts of our her­itage and what make us the cul­tural su­per­power we are,” Mr Dow­den said. “This vi­tal fund­ing will se­cure their fu­ture and pro­tect jobs right away.”</p>
    <p>This is the fourth round of fund­ing an­nounced by the DCMS. In pre­vi­ous rounds, in­de­pen­dent cin­e­mas, her­itage in­sti­tu­tions and cul­tural or­gan­i­sa­tions were awarded grants of up to £1 mil­lion, with the aim of help­ing them plan for re­open­ing and restart­ing per­for­mances and pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>The DCMS said more than £500 mil­lion has been al­lo­cated from the fund to nearly 2,500 cul­tural or­gan­i­sa­tions and venues of all sizes – in­clud­ing cin­e­mas, her­itage sites, mu­se­ums, cir­cuses, fes­ti­vals and com­edy clubs across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Most arts and cul­tural in­sti­tu­tions across Bri­tain had been told to close since March when the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hit. A num­ber of venues went into ad­min­is­tra­tion, even though the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment an­nounced an emer­gency sup­port pack­age to help pro­tect the fu­ture of theatres, gal­leries and mu­se­ums.</p>
    <p>To bring life back to nor­mal, coun­tries such as Bri­tain, China, Rus­sia and the United States are rac­ing against time to de­velop coro­n­avirus vac­cines.</p>
