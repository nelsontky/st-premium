    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) has filed a po­lice re­port against the Cri­sis Cen­tre (Sin­ga­pore) af­ter find­ing “sus­pi­cion of crim­i­nal mis­con­duct”.</p>
    <p>The po­lice re­port comes about a year af­ter the Com­mis­sioner of Char­i­ties Ang Hak Seng barred Cri­sis Cen­tre, a small char­ity that ran home­less shel­ters, from fundrais­ing af­ter find­ing se­ri­ous gov­er­nance con­cerns.</p>
    <p>The MSF spokesman told The Straits Times that it had in­ves­ti­gated the group’s fund-rais­ing ap­peals and found pos­si­ble crim­i­nal mis­con­duct.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing, a po­lice spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The Cri­sis Cen­tre closed its two shel­ters – at 150D and 150F Joo Chiat Ter­race – at the end of last month as it had run out of funds, pres­i­dent Den­nis Lee Wen Da said.</p>
    <p>The char­ity let go of its four staff and found al­ter­na­tive ac­com­mo­da­tion for its nine res­i­dents, he added.</p>
    <p>Its trou­bles started in Au­gust last year, when the Com­mis­sioner of Char­i­ties sus­pended the Cri­sis Cen­tre from rais­ing funds for six months while its fund­ing prac­tices were probed.</p>
    <p>Dr Ang said at the time: “In­ves­ti­ga­tions to date have raised se­ri­ous con­cerns about the char­ity’s gov­er­nance, record-keep­ing prac­tices and abil­ity to be ac­count­able to its donors.”</p>
    <p>The Cri­sis Cen­tre was still al­lowed to op­er­ate dur­ing the probe but was sus­pended from fund-rais­ing.</p>
    <p>This sus­pen­sion was ex­tended in Fe­bru­ary by a fur­ther three months while in­ves­ti­ga­tions con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal blow came at the end of June when Dr Ang said the char­ity’s pres­i­dent, Mr Lee, was also banned from rais­ing funds for the Cri­sis Cen­tre or any other char­ity as he did not ad­min­is­ter fund-rais­ing ap­peals prop­erly and failed to en­sure proper ac­count­abil­ity over the money col­lected.</p>
    <p>The Cri­sis Cen­tre it­self was barred from rais­ing funds un­til it met three con­di­tions, in­clud­ing im­ple­ment­ing proper sys­tems and con­trols for fund-rais­ing, as well as putting in place proper vol­un­teer man­age­ment sys­tems and con­trols to en­sure over­sight of fund-rais­ers con­ducted by its vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>The Char­i­ties Com­mis­sioner said in June that the MSF was pre­pared to work with the Cri­sis Cen­tre to im­prove its gov­er­nance, in­ter­nal con­trols and fund-rais­ing pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>This would en­able the char­ity to con­tinue to ren­der its ser­vices to the com­mu­nity with greater ac­count­abil­ity and trans­parency.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Cri­sis Cen­tre did not pur­sue the of­fer, the MSF spokesman told ST on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The MSF said it also helped the Cri­sis Cen­tre re­gard­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures and sup­plied it with gloves, masks and hand sani­tis­ers when the Covid-19 pan­demic arose.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, a 26-year-old con­trac­tor, told ST yes­ter­day: “I have been as­sist­ing the po­lice’s in­quiry as a wit­ness to clear the al­le­ga­tions.”</p>
    <p>He and his board mem­bers reg­is­tered Cri­sis Cen­tre as a char­ity in 2018 as he felt strongly that “home­less­ness shouldn’t ex­ist”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said they spent $30,000 of their own money to get the shel­ter go­ing but funds soon ran out.</p>
    <p>Fund-rais­ing ap­peals, such as through the char­ity’s web­site, met with tepid donor re­sponse and re­quests for fund­ing from the MSF were un­suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>They then turned to mar­ket­ing firm ACME Group.</p>
    <p>Cri­sis Cen­tre vol­un­teers hit the streets to sell ACME’s Bold mem</p>
    <p>I and the other board mem­bers were not paid a sin­gle cent by the Cri­sis Cen­tre. And we have ex­plained our­selves to all those who have sup­ported us.</p>
    <p>They should not be in a po­si­tion where his or her per­sonal in­ter­est may con­flict with his or her role as a gov­ern­ing board mem­ber. bership cards for $10 each. The mem­ber­ship card of­fered dis­counts from var­i­ous mer­chants.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said they raised over $400,000 in about a year, which al­lowed the char­ity to set up a sec­ond shel­ter, which dou­bled its ca­pac­ity to house a to­tal of 24 men in the two fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Last year, the char­ity told the ST that it had monthly over­head costs of about $30,000 from run­ning the two shel­ters, in­clud­ing staff salaries.</p>
    <p>ST checks found that Mr Lee is a share­holder of the ACME Group. He told ST he is a mi­nor­ity share­holder and that he had de­clared his share­hold­ing to other board mem­bers of the Cri­sis Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>In the char­ity’s 2018 an­nual re­port, it was stated that Mr Lee made two po­ten­tial con­flict of in­ter­est dec­la­ra­tions with re­gard to his per­sonal busi­ness in­ter­ests to the board and he ab­stained from any de­ci­sion re­lated to th­ese mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said: “I and the other board mem­bers were not paid a sin­gle cent by the Cri­sis Cen­tre. And we have ex­plained our­selves to all those who have sup­ported us.”</p>
    <p>When asked about the con­flict of in­ter­est is­sues given Mr Lee’s lead­er­ship of the char­ity and his share­hold­ing at ACME Group, Dr Ang noted that char­i­ties should set out clear poli­cies, pro­ce­dures and checks to ad­dress ac­tual or po­ten­tial con­flict of in­ter­est is­sues.</p>
    <p>He added: “They should not be in a po­si­tion where his or her per­sonal in­ter­est may con­flict with his or her role as a gov­ern­ing board mem­ber.”</p>
