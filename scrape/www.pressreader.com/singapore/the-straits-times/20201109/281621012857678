    <p>LIS­BON • Por­tu­gal will im­pose lo­calised night-time cur­fews from today to con­tain the spread of the coro­n­avirus as the num­ber of cases reached a record high, Prime Min­is­ter An­to­nio Costa an­nounced in the early hours of yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We can­not have the slight­est doubt that ev­ery­thing must be done to con­tain the pan­demic,” Mr Costa told a news con­fer­ence. “If we fail to do so, we must in­creas­ingly adopt more re­stric­tive mea­sures and com­pro­mise the month of De­cem­ber.”</p>
    <p>The overnight cur­fews, from 11pm to 5am, will come into force across 121 of the coun­try’s 308 mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties, in­clud­ing Lis­bon and Porto, today as the coun­try en­ters a 15-day state of emer­gency. Night work­ers are ex­empted.</p>
    <p>Mr Costa also an­nounced that those in the 121 mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties – home to about 70 per cent of Por­tu­gal’s pop­u­la­tion – will not be able to leave their homes be­tween 1pm and 5am dur­ing the next two week­ends – on both Satur­day and Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Some com­mer­cial out­lets will close dur­ing these times but restau­rants will be al­lowed to pro­vide take­away ser­vices, Mr Costa said, ad­mit­ting that the week­end mea­sure will inevitably hit the sec­tor hard.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial state of emer­gency, which un­der Por­tuguese law can be ex­tended in­def­i­nitely in 15-day pe­ri­ods, was de­clared in March and lasted six weeks. It re­stricted the move­ment of peo­ple and led thou­sands of busi­nesses to sus­pend ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Por­tu­gal, with just over 10 mil­lion peo­ple, has recorded a com­par­a­tively low 173,540 cases and 2,848 deaths, but fresh cases reached 6,640 on Satur­day, the high­est daily fig­ure since the pan­demic started. Test­ing has also in­creased.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 2,420 peo­ple are in hospi­tal, with 366 in in­ten­sive care units (ICUs) – more than the April peak of 271.</p>
    <p>The health­care sys­tem, which prior to the pan­demic had the low­est num­ber of crit­i­cal care beds per 100,000 in­hab­i­tants in Europe, can ac­com­mo­date 800 Covid-19 pa­tients in ICUs.</p>
