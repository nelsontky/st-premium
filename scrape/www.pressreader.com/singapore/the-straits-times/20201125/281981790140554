    <p>YAN­GON • The Na­tional League for Democ­racy (NLD), the in­cum­bent party led by Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, se­cured another land­slide vic­tory in this month’s gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>It did bet­ter in the Nov 8 polls than in 2015, a land­mark elec­tion, win­ning this year 396 of the 476 elected seats to be filled in both the Lower and the Up­per Houses. (Another 166 seats were re­served for mil­i­tary ap­pointees.)</p>
    <p>And the NLD ob­tained this re­sult de­spite the gov­ern­ment’s weak per­for­mance on its key pledges dur­ing its first term in of­fice – con­sti­tu­tional re­form, na­tional rec­on­cil­i­a­tion and peace, so­cio-eco­nomic im­prove­ment – and the rise of both eth­nic mi­nor­ity par­ties and new chal­lengers.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to Ms Suu Kyi’s party and the mil­i­tary-backed Union Sol­i­dar­ity and De­vel­op­ment Party (USDP), some 90 par­ties fielded can­di­dates this year.</p>
    <p>So what does the out­come say about what Myan­mar’s vot­ers re­ally care about?</p>
    <p>In 2015, Ms Suu Kyi em­bod­ied hope and change, but while her pop­u­lar­ity en­dures today, its na­ture has changed. Her party’s suc­cess at the polls this month has less to do with what she stands for than what she stands against: the mil­i­tary’s en­dur­ing power, in­clud­ing in civil­ian af­fairs.</p>
    <p>That, at least, is for the more pre­dictable part of this ar­gu­ment. Now comes the para­dox: The NLD, which was the in­cum­bent party in this elec­tion for the first time, also ben­e­fited from var­i­ous struc­tural fea­tures cre­ated by the mil­i­tary regime that Ms Suu Kyi’s party has fought for decades.</p>
    <p>The NLD’s re­sound­ing vic­tory speaks to her abil­ity, still, to rally vot­ers in op­po­si­tion to the mil­i­tary and its po­lit­i­cal prox­ies, and in the name of demo­cratic de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>THE MIL­I­TARY’S SHADOW</p>
    <p>In a coun­try rav­aged by a half cen­tury of mil­i­tary mis­rule – and in which the mil­i­tary today still con­trols ma­jor min­istries and has veto power both in Par­lia­ment and over any pro­posed amend­ment to the Con­sti­tu­tion – the civil-mil­i­tary di­vide re­mains the</p>
    <p>most im­por­tant po­lit­i­cal is­sue for many peo­ple in Myan­mar, what­ever mis­giv­ings they might have about the NLD’s gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>Less than a week be­fore the vote, the coun­try’s com­man­der-in-chief, Se­nior Gen­eral Min Aung Hlaing, urged the na­tional elec­tion com­mis­sion to be “care­ful” – a sug­ges­tion that he might chal­lenge the elec­tion’s re­sults.</p>
    <p>A few days later, the na­tion­al­ist monk Ashin Wi­rathu, who is known for both his links to the mil­i­tary and in­flam­ma­tory lan­guage against Mus­lims, resur­faced in pub­lic af­ter more than a year on the run: In May last year, he was charged with sedi­tion for in­sult­ing Ms Suu Kyi and her gov­ern­ment. As he handed him­self over to the po­lice, he called on his fol­low­ers “to vote for the par­ties that work to pro­tect the coun­try’s race and re­li­gion”.</p>
    <p>Then on Nov 6, a bomb ex­ploded at the of­fice of the elec­tion com­mis­sion in Bago, a small city about 65 kilo­me­tres from Yan­gon. Spec­u­la­tion was rife on so­cial me­dia that the ex­plo­sion was</p>
    <p>some­how con­nected to the omi­nous state­ments of Gen­eral Min Aung Hlaing and Ashin Wi­rathu.</p>
    <p>But nei­ther that act of vi­o­lence nor the fear-mon­ger­ing nor the veiled threats seem to have served the old es­tab­lish­ment: If any­thing, all that ap­pears to have only re­minded vot­ers of the coun­try’s ter­ri­fy­ing past, play­ing into the NLD’s own cam­paign rhetoric.</p>
    <p>The USDP will now hold just 71 seats out of a to­tal of 1,117 in the na­tional Par­lia­ment and all states and lo­cal as­sem­blies; that’s 46 fewer than in 2015. No party that ran on an ul­tra-na­tion­al­ist plat­form won any seat.</p>
    <p>GRAT­I­TUDE FOR SAC­RI­FICES</p>
    <p>Ms Suu Kyi also seems to have gar­nered ad­mi­ra­tion in Myan­mar for de­fend­ing her gov­ern­ment – and so, as was widely per­ceived, the coun­try it­self – against ac­cu­sa­tions of geno­cide against the Ro­hingya at a hear­ing be­fore the In­ter­na­tional Court of Jus­tice last year. Many peo­ple here see her de­fence as an ul­ti­mate sac­ri­fice for Myan­mar, per­haps in par­tic­u­lar be­cause she stood up for the</p>
    <p>coun­try in the face of ac­cu­sa­tions against her life­long foes: the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>In other words, vot­ing for Ms Suu Kyi was partly an ex­pres­sion of grat­i­tude to a mother fig­ure who is seen as hav­ing sac­ri­ficed her per­sonal well-be­ing, her life and now, too, her iconic rep­u­ta­tion world­wide for Myan­mar’s democ­racy and de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Yet this alone doesn’t ex­plain her party’s suc­cess: The NLD, af­ter five years in power, also ben­e­fited from var­i­ous in­cum­bent’s ad­van­tages – in­clud­ing pre­rog­a­tives and poli­cies that were put in place by the pre­vi­ous mil­i­tary regime.</p>
    <p>Myan­mar’s elec­tions are de­ter­mined ac­cord­ing to the first-past-the-post (or win­ner-takes-all) prin­ci­ple, which can pro­duce a ratio of seats-to-votes that doesn’t strictly rep­re­sent an elec­torate’s pref­er­ences over­all. What’s more, the sys­tem en­cour­ages tac­ti­cal vot­ing, in­clud­ing in eth­nic re­gions.</p>
    <p>Some eth­nic vot­ers seem to have voted for the NLD, a strong and es­tab­lished party, rather than their</p>
    <p>real first choice – a small eth­nic party – be­cause de­feat­ing the mil­i­tary’s prox­ies re­mained an ab­so­lute pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>The eth­nic mi­nor­ity par­ties did not per­form well at the na­tional level, even though they had merged or forged al­liances to avoid split­ting the vote. (Some did, how­ever, make mod­est gains that will give them some in­flu­ence in state leg­is­la­tures, in­clud­ing in Shan, Rakhine and Kayah states.)</p>
    <p>Like­wise for some new par­ties that had splin­tered from the NLD or were cre­ated in op­po­si­tion to Ms Suu Kyi’s cen­tralised lead­er­ship or her gov­ern­ment’s weak eco­nomic per­for­mance, such as the Peo­ple’s Party, the Peo­ple’s Pi­o­neer Party and the Union Bet­ter­ment Party. None of those won any seat.</p>
    <p>And this is to say noth­ing of the fact that more than 1.5 mil­lion vot­ers in eth­nic re­gions weren’t al­lowed to vote, os­ten­si­bly be­cause of se­cu­rity rea­sons; or that mea­sures to limit the spread of the coro­n­avirus ham­pered the in-per­son cam­paigns of small par­ties; or that the state me­dia cen­sored dis­sent­ing voices – all fac­tors that cre­ated an un­even play­ing field for the op­po­si­tion, es­pe­cially re­source-strapped eth­nic par­ties.</p>
    <p>BURMANISAT­ION POL­ICY</p>
    <p>Then there is de­mog­ra­phy. Decades of a “Burmanisat­ion” pol­icy, a sys­tem­atic ef­fort to cul­tur­ally as­sim­i­late the coun­try’s very many eth­nic groups, have fur­ther in­sti­tu­tion­alised ben­e­fits and priv­i­leged ac­cess to pub­lic ser­vices for the ma­jor­ity Ba­mar eth­nic group. Another ef­fect has been to change the com­po­si­tion and bal­ance of the pop­u­la­tion in some eth­nic re­gions, typ­i­cally to the dis­ad­van­tage of lo­cal eth­nic groups – a re­sult that has some­times been com­pounded by in­ter­nal mi­gra­tions caused by poverty.</p>
    <p>De­mo­graphic changes also hurt eth­nic par­ties in this month’s elec­tions in Kachin, Karen and Mon states, and all the more so be­cause early this year the NLD gov­ern­ment low­ered the res­i­dency re­quire­ment for vot­ers (from 180 days to 90 days), al­low­ing many mi­grants or very new res­i­dents – in most cases, from the ma­jor­ity Ba­mar group – to vote in eth­nic mi­nor­ity re­gions.</p>
    <p>So now what? Is the elec­tion’s out­come, and the peo­ple’s pow­er­ful re-en­dorse­ment of the gov­ern­ment, a val­i­da­tion of the NLD’s ver­sion of democ­racy: su­per-ma­jori­tar­ian and, some might say, il­lib­eral?</p>
    <p>On Nov 12, the NLD sent a let­ter to 48 eth­nic po­lit­i­cal par­ties invit­ing them to join it in build­ing a fed­eral demo­cratic union and “end­ing civil war”.</p>
    <p>VOTE TO DO BET­TER</p>
    <p>“The eth­nic par­ties’ ob­jec­tives are the same as the NLD’s, and the NLD will pri­ori­tise the eth­nic peo­ples’ de­sires in the fu­ture,” the let­ter said. A party spokesman also said that new gov­ern­ment “must be a na­tional unity gov­ern­ment”.</p>
    <p>This is a wel­come step, and it sug­gests that the NLD is aware that even its ap­par­ently com­mand­ing man­date and ring­ing pop­u­lar­ity have po­lit­i­cal lim­its in such a di­vided so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The risk, though, is that the party might only be ges­tur­ing at a gov­ern­ment of na­tional unity and will then try to co-opt the eth­nic par­ties with var­i­ous po­lit­i­cal re­wards.</p>
    <p>But stick­ing with the po­lit­i­cal sta­tus quo would not help solve the coun­try’s deep­est prob­lems; more likely, it would cre­ate even more dead­lock – and breed anti-sys­tem re­sent­ment; more rad­i­cal eth­nic na­tion­al­ism, as al­ready ex­ists in Rakhine state; or ad­ven­tur­ism on the part of the mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>Civil-mil­i­tary re­la­tions have been de­te­ri­o­rat­ing. Eth­nic con­flicts are in­ten­si­fy­ing. In­ter­na­tional pres­sure over the Ro­hingya cri­sis con­tin­ues. So­cio-eco­nomic hard­ships have wors­ened with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. The NLD’s vic­tory was a vote of con­fi­dence that it can do bet­ter, not an en­dorse­ment for more of the same.</p>
