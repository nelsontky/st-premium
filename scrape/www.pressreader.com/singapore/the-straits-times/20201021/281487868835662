    <p>To bol­ster the com­pet­i­tive­ness of Sin­ga­pore’s man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor, a new in­dus­try-led train­ing pro­gramme of­fice will plan ways to en­sure the work­force has emerg­ing know-how.</p>
    <p>Launched yes­ter­day, the Ad­vanced Man­u­fac­tur­ing Train­ing Academy (Amta) will be lo­cated at the Jurong In­no­va­tion District (JID) man­u­fac­tur­ing hub, which has at­tracted about $420 mil­lion in in­vest­ments over the past year.</p>
    <p>The Amta pro­gramme of­fice will work with schools and train­ing providers to de­sign new cour­ses to help work­ers ex­cel, as Sin­ga­pore es­tab­lishes it­self as an ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing hub. It will also work to pre­dict what skills and knowl­edge such work­ers will need to meet fu­ture in­dus­try re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Amta was an­nounced by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day dur­ing the In­dus­trial Trans­for­ma­tion Asia-Pa­cific con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>It will be sup­ported by the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search, the Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board (EDB) and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore. Also con­tribut­ing to the academy are the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity and Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Amta will be gov­erned by a train­ing coun­cil com­pris­ing in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing, pub­lic agen­cies and unions, and will be led by the for­mer man­ag­ing direc­tor and Sin­ga­pore coun­try man­ager of Mi­cron Semi­con­duc­tor Asia, Mr Lee Kok Choy.</p>
    <p>“Amta as­pires to col­lab­o­rate with strate­gic part­ners to plan and de­liver train­ing to meet in­dus­try needs and strengthen Sin­ga­pore’s man­u­fac­tur­ing com­pet­i­tive­ness against the back­drop of rapidly chang­ing tech­nol­ogy trends,” said Mr Lee, who is also the chair­man of Te­masek Poly­tech­nic’s board of gov­er­nors.</p>
    <p>Amta’s lo­ca­tion in the JID is strate­gic, given plans to make the district a one-stop ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing hub for Sin­ga­pore by bring­ing to­gether re­searchers, stu­dents, in­no­va­tors and busi­nesses to de­velop prod­ucts and ser­vices of the fu­ture. The first phase of the 600ha JID is ex­pected to be com­pleted around 2022, with the district cre­at­ing over 95,000 new jobs.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore gov­ern­ment agency JTC, which is de­vel­op­ing the district, said yes­ter­day that de­spite dis­rup­tions brought about by the Covid-19 pan­demic, JID has at­tracted about $420 mil­lion in new in­vest­ments over the past year.</p>
    <p>Last week, South Korean car man­u­fac­turer Hyundai marked the ground­break­ing of its new in­no­va­tion cen­tre at JID, which will be ready by 2022. Be­sides Hyundai, other com­pa­nies that will be open­ing fa­cil­i­ties in the JID in­clude imag­ing prod­uct man­u­fac­turer Kon­ica Mi­nolta, ro­bot­ics de­vel­oper Fanuc and en­gi­neer­ing com­pany Bosch Rexroth.</p>
    <p>Mean­while yes­ter­day, EDB said it would be part­ner­ing the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum to glob­ally ex­pand the Sin­ga­pore-de­vel­oped Smart In­dus­try Readi­ness In­dex (Siri), which spells out ways man­u­fac­tur­ing com­pa­nies can trans­form to meet fu­ture chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>The aim of the part­ner­ship is to make Siri an in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised stan­dard for In­dus­try 4.0 trans­for­ma­tion. In­dus­try 4.0 refers to a new phase in the in­dus­trial rev­o­lu­tion that fo­cuses heav­ily on tech­nolo­gies like ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, au­to­ma­tion, ma­chine learn­ing and data an­a­lyt­ics to op­ti­mise how goods are man­u­fac­tured.</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age the global adop­tion of the in­dex, 90 cer­ti­fied Siri as­ses­sors will be trained over the next 18 months. Th­ese as­ses­sors will work to con­duct be­tween 500 and 750 new of­fi­cial Siri as­sess­ments by the end of next year. Over 350 firms that come from more than 15 coun­tries and are based here have com­pleted such as­sess­ments since the in­dex was launched in Novem­ber 2017.</p>
