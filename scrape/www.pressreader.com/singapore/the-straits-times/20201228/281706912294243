    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic turned the lux­ury of con­ve­nience of hav­ing food and gro­ceries de­liv­ered to one’s doorstep into a ne­ces­sity for many Sin­ga­pore­ans this year.</p>
    <p>As the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion es­ca­lated in late March, the Gov­ern­ment ad­vised the pub­lic to avoid non-es­sen­tial trips out of their homes and to buy food and gro­ceries on­line to re­duce phys­i­cal in­ter­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, de­liv­ery slots were quickly snapped up for su­per­mar­kets such as Cold Stor­age and FairPrice, as well as on­line gro­cery shop­ping ser­vices like RedMart.</p>
    <p>Some shop­pers had to wait days or even weeks for a time slot, with RedMart an­nounc­ing on April 5 that it was see­ing 11 times as many cus­tomers as usual.</p>
    <p>Then came the ban on din­ing-in at restau­rants, which was in ef­fect from the start of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod on April 7 to the be­gin­ning of phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing on June 19.</p>
    <p>Just a week into the cir­cuit breaker, de­mand for food de­liv­ery ser­vices had in­creased by up to 30 per cent, ac­cord­ing to a joint state­ment by En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore, the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity and the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency.</p>
    <p>The surge proved to be sus­tained. A sur­vey con­ducted by the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s In­sti­tute of Ser­vice Ex­cel­lence be­tween July and Septem­ber found that more than three in five restau­rant cus­tomers or­dered more take­out or food de­liv­ery be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, restau­rants that were not al­ready of­fer­ing de­liv­er­ies quickly scram­bled to sign up with de­liv­ery plat­forms.</p>
    <p>The Big Three play­ers, GrabFood, De­liv­eroo and Food­panda, each re­ported in April that they had added hun­dreds of new food and bev­er­age op­er­a­tors. Smaller play­ers like WhyQ and Od­dle also re­ported sev­eral times more trans­ac­tions and in­ter­est from op­er­a­tors than usual.</p>
    <p>Ex­actly two weeks into the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced that stand­alone shops pri­mar­ily sell­ing drinks, snacks and desserts would no longer be al­lowed to open, even for take­away.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came just a day be­fore the new rule kicked in on April 22, which led to long queues form­ing at bub­ble tea shops as Sin­ga­pore­ans tried to get a fi­nal taste of their favourite bev­er­age.</p>
    <p>But the fear that bub­ble tea would be in­def­i­nitely un­avail­able proved to be short-lived, as many en­ter­pris­ing chains like Milk­sha, Gong Cha and Koi soon tied up with eater­ies to of­fer their drinks as add-ons to meals through food de­liv­ery ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Taxi op­er­a­tor Com­fortDelGro an­nounced its own de­liv­ery ser­vice on April 29, which al­lowed taxi driv­ers – blighted by a dearth of pas­sen­gers – to take on food and gro­cery de­liv­ery jobs.</p>
    <p>Other new en­trants like Pick­upp Sin­ga­pore, prop­erty de­vel­oper Cap­i­taLand’s Capi­ta3Eats and reser­va­tion plat­form Chope also emerged to take on the Big Three food de­liv­ery play­ers.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ini­tia­tives aimed at help­ing hawkers and restau­rants by­pass the com­mis­sion fees charged by de­liv­ery plat­forms were also launched, and some busi­ness own­ers took mat­ters into their own hands by com­ing up with their own de­liv­ery sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Even night­clubs like Zouk and cock­tail bars like Jig­ger and Pony be­gan of­fer­ing bot­tled cock­tails de­liv­ered for up­wards of $30 a pop.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic also ac­cel­er­ated the ex­pan­sion of “cloud kitchens” that pre­pare food specif­i­cally for de­liv­ery and do not have phys­i­cal shop fronts, in­clud­ing sev­eral run by the Big Three.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar trends have also been seen over­seas. The Amer­i­can fast­food chain Wendy’s an­nounced this month that it plans to open 250 cloud kitchens in In­dia, where it has just nine phys­i­cal out­lets.</p>
    <p>One ca­su­alty of the ex­plo­sion in de­mand for de­liv­ery has been Sin­ga­pore’s waste re­duc­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey by alumni of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Master of Science (En­vi­ron­men­tal Man­age­ment) pro­gramme found that 1,334 tonnes of ad­di­tional plas­tic waste was gen­er­ated from take­away and de­liv­ery meals dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
