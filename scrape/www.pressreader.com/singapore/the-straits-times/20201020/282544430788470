    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ac­tor Liam Nee­son’s thriller Hon­est Thief limped to first place at the Amer­i­can box of­fice, de­but­ing at US$3.7 mil­lion (S$5 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Those ticket sales, among the low­est ever to land at No. 1, came in slightly ahead of di­rec­tor Christophe­r Nolan’s Tenet and ac­tor Robert De Niro’s fam­ily comedy War With Grandpa.</p>
    <p>Tenet, now in its sev­enth week of re­lease, grossed US$1.6 mil­lion, bring­ing its United States haul to US$50.6 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The sci­ence-fic­tion epic from Warner Bros con­tin­ues to fare bet­ter over­seas. Tenet gen­er­ated US$5 mil­lion at the in­ter­na­tional box of­fice for a global haul of US$333.9 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Over­all, it was another quiet time at the week­end box of­fice as cin­e­mas that re­opened have re­sorted to re­duc­ing hours of op­er­a­tion or clos­ing down again en­tirely due to low at­ten­dance.</p>
    <p>Ap­pre­hen­sion among movie­go­ers, cou­pled with the lack of new po­ten­tial block­busters, are to blame for lack­lus­tre ticket sales.</p>
    <p>The­atre own­ers ar­gue that it is not fear keep­ing people from go­ing to the movies, but the dearth of fresh prod­uct from ma­jor stu­dios.</p>
    <p>But Hol­ly­wood com­pa­nies have been re­luc­tant to un­veil their big­gest movies be­cause cin­e­mas in ma­jor mar­kets such as New York and Los Angeles, which ac­count for a bulk of ticket sales for any given movie, are not open.</p>
    <p>A po­ten­tial bright spot: New York Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo last Satur­day gave movie the­atres out­side of the city per­mis­sion to re­open at re­duced ca­pac­ity start­ing on Fri­day. It re­mains to be seen whether the news will en­cour­age stu­dios to start un­veil­ing ma­jor movies.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, spe­cial­ity stu­dios such as 101 Stu­dios and IFC Films have been sup­ply­ing ex­hibitors with new in­die dra­mas and come­dies.</p>
    <p>War With Grandpa col­lected US$2.5 mil­lion from 2,260 lo­ca­tions in its se­cond week­end of re­lease, boost­ing do­mes­tic re­ceipts to US$7.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney, mean­while, con­tin­ues to find mod­est suc­cess with re-re­leases of past favourites.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Tim Bur­ton’s 1993 hol­i­day clas­sic, The Night­mare Be­fore Christ­mas, brought in US$1.3 mil­lion be­tween last Fri­day and Sun­day. And Ho­cus Po­cus, another three-decade-old hit, stirred up US$765,000 over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Ro­man­tic drama 2 Hearts, star­ring Ja­cob Elordi of The Kiss­ing Booth (2018) and Eupho­ria (2019 to present) fame, pulled in US$565,000 from 1,683 screens over the week­end.</p>
    <p>Box-of­fice an­a­lysts sug­gest that young adult-skew­ing movies, the kind that reg­u­larly pop­u­lates Net­flix queues, have not been a huge the­atri­cal draw dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Based on at least three youthori­ented movies re­leased dur­ing the last month and a half, teenagers and young adults do not ap­pear ready to re­turn to the movies,” said Mr David A. Gross, who runs movie con­sult­ing firm Fran­chise En­ter­tain­ment Re­search.</p>
