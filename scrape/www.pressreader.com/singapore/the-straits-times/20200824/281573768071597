    <p>Some 72 per cent of small com­pa­nies in Singapore are sat­is­fied with the re­lief mea­sures rolled out by the Govern­ment to help them cope with the eco­nomic fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey. Their level of sat­is­fac­tion is higher than the re­gional av­er­age of</p>
    <p>58 per cent, the sur­vey found.</p>
    <p>About three in four small com­pa­nies in Singapore, or 72 per cent, are sat­is­fied with the re­lief mea­sures rolled out by the Govern­ment to help them cope with the eco­nomic fall­out due to Covid-19, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey out to­day.</p>
    <p>The level of sat­is­fac­tion of the com­pa­nies polled here is higher than the re­gional av­er­age of 58 per cent, the sur­vey found from 1,000 com­pa­nies with an an­nual turnover of $20 mil­lion and be­low across five coun­tries in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies in two coun­tries – Viet­nam and Malaysia – also re­ported sat­is­fac­tion lev­els higher than the re­gional av­er­age, at 68 per cent and 61 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>In Thai­land, 47 per cent of the com­pa­nies said they were sat­is­fied with their govern­ment re­lief mea­sures, while in In­done­sia, the fig­ure stood at 45 per cent.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, con­ducted by United Overseas Bank (UOB), Ac­cen­ture and Dun & Brad­street, also found that the top three re­lief mea­sures that re­spon­dents in Singapore wanted were wage as­sis­tance (48 per cent), busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion sup­port (44 per cent) and loan as­sis­tance (36 per cent).</p>
    <p>This is con­trasted with the top three re­lief mea­sures that com­pa­nies in the re­gion wanted, such as de­fer­ment of in­come tax (50 per cent), loan as­sis­tance (46 per cent), and wage as­sis­tance (36 per cent).</p>
    <p>A state­ment from UOB and Dun & Brad­street said: “Given that one in two small busi­nesses across Asean is fac­ing cash­flow chal­lenges as a re­sult of the pan­demic, the ma­jor­ity of re­spon­dents in­di­cated a pref­er­ence for cash­flow-re­lated sup­port from their gov­ern­ments.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lawrence Loh, group busi­ness bank­ing head at UOB, said that as small busi­nesses tap re­lief mea­sures aimed at cash­flow prob­lems to ease their im­me­di­ate chal­lenges, other forms of govern­ment as­sis­tance could be used to help them emerge stronger post-Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The bank has found that many of its cus­tomers who run small busi­nesses “are not only con­cerned with im­me­di­ate chal­lenges but also with ex­plor­ing en­ter­pris­ing ways to pro­tect the long-term vi­a­bil­ity of their busi­ness”, Mr Loh said.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, which was con­ducted in the third quar­ter of last year be­fore the coro­n­avirus out­break, as well as in May this year, showed that small busi­nesses in Singapore want more in­vest­ment in dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture to sup­port in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies sur­veyed were not nec­es­sar­ily UOB bank­ing clients.</p>
    <p>“Ex­am­ples of dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture in­clude na­tional busi­ness data­bases for elec­tronic know-your-cus­tomer pro­cesses and na­tion­wide net­works for elec­tronic in­voic­ing pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>“The need for more dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­ture was also ranked as the top area of sup­port needed among small busi­nesses across Asean,” the state­ment said.</p>
