    <p>The pan­demic has driven more women to take charge of their fam­i­lies’ ex­penses, prov­ing that they are just as ca­pa­ble in fi­nan­cial plan­ning, if not bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Take Ms Tara Beier and her hus­band Den­nis. They kept sep­a­rate bank ac­counts and di­vided their house­hold re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band, 42, cov­ered the mort­gage on the two prop­er­ties they own, while Ms Beier, 38, man­aged and took care of a rental home.</p>
    <p>When the pan­demic hit, her hus­band lost his job as a pro­ducer in the film in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>A singer-song­writer, Ms Beier is now re­spon­si­ble for cov­er­ing mort­gage, food, ev­ery­day ex­penses and rent. She does not mind. “I felt like he’s re­ly­ing on me more as a woman,” said Ms Beier, who lives in Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Once the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hit, she wanted to know specifics – be­cause what if her hus­band got sick? Where were their im­por­tant doc­u­ments, or pass­words for bank ac­counts?</p>
    <p>Did he have any debt? To­gether in iso­la­tion for three months, the cou­ple had lots of time to talk. And talk they did, about their dreams, their goals and their fi­nances.</p>
    <p>Many women, who have of­ten let their hus­bands deal with fis­cal mat­ters, recog­nise that they can no longer bury their heads in the sand. In an era when ev­ery­thing feels uncer­tain, they crave trans­parency, es­pe­cially when it comes to money.</p>
    <p>Ms Erika Wasser­man, a fi­nan­cial ther­a­pist in Mi­ami, said: “Women are plan­ners by na­ture, so for us this is an op­por­tu­nity to ask the hus­band, what’s our plan? Not just what’s our bud­get or mort­gage, but what’s our plan for life in­sur­ance? Where do you want to be buried? That might be the first time they’re ask­ing the ques­tions in a long time.”</p>
    <p>Be­yond health con­cerns, there is the very real fact that more women than men have lost jobs dur­ing the pan­demic. Be­tween Fe­bru­ary and May alone, women lost 11.5 mil­lion jobs, com­pared with nine mil­lion for men, ac­cord­ing to the Pew Re­search Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>A re­cent sur­vey also found that women are gen­er­ally less savvy in in­vest­ment than men, with 47 per cent as­so­ci­at­ing neg­a­tive words like “fear”, “anx­i­ety”, “in­ad­e­quacy” and “dread” with fi­nan­cial plan­ning, com­pared with 31 per cent of men.</p>
    <p>Ms Michelle Smith, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Source Fi­nan­cial Ad­vi­sors in New York, says it is time women take a more ac­tive role in the house­hold fi­nances. “In my ex­pe­ri­ence, it’s still male-dom­i­nated within a mar­riage,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I hate to paint that, but it’s true. A lot of women are scared to sit down and say – ‘What’s in my name? What do we have? Do we have any trusts? What’s this thing I signed?’ So many women don’t know what to do.”</p>
    <p>As for Ms Beier, the un­com­fort­able con­ver­sa­tions with her hus­band brought “a re­ally good clar­ity to our re­la­tion­ship”, she said.</p>
    <p>Granted, she wasn’t thrilled with all of the news – like dis­cov­er­ing that he had a few credit cards and was about $30,000 in debt. This was es­pe­cially alarm­ing; she uses only a debit card.</p>
    <p>But all of their talks, she said, “brought us to a new level. We didn’t re­alise how much pres­sure money has put on us. Covid-19 gave us the abil­ity to say, what do we re­ally need and not need? It has been a bless­ing for us in dis­guise”.</p>
    <p>Ms Smith, the fi­nan­cial planner, takes it a step fur­ther. “This con­ver­sa­tion isn’t a lux­ury,” she said. “It’s a ne­ces­sity.” own name to get through six months of my fam­ily’s to­tal over­head ex­penses, like hous­ing, taxes and per­sonal ex­penses? Am I the owner or ben­e­fi­ciary of my hus­band’s life in­sur­ance policy? If the policy is owned by a trust, do I know who the trustees are or if I am a ben­e­fi­ciary of the trust?</p>
    <p>What is my le­gal or emo­tional re­course if my hus­band re­fuses to share in­for­ma­tion? (The quick an­swer: no re­course, un­less you file for di­vorce, which com­pels fi­nan­cial dis­cov­ery.)</p>
