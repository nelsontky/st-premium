    <p>Play­ers in the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) will have to wait a lit­tle longer be­fore the league is given the green light by au­thor­i­ties to re­sume.</p>
    <p>Over 200 play­ers and match of­fi­cials were swab tested for the Covid-19 virus last Sun­day with a view to a restart of Sin­ga­pore’s only pro­fes­sional sports league since its March 24 sus­pen­sion, sub­ject to all test re­sults com­ing back neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>How­ever, The Straits Times un­der­stands that out of those tested, 16 were retested yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear why they were re­quired to do so, but it is un­der­stood the other tests re­sults that came through yes­ter­day were neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>With those who un­dergo swab tests typ­i­cally re­ceiv­ing re­sults within three days, this means a Satur­day restart – which was tar­geted but ap­peared un­likely – is now off the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>In any case, coaches in the SPL had ex­pressed con­cern that the date would have come too soon for them to prop­erly pre­pare their teams for a first com­pet­i­tive match in al­most seven months.</p>
    <p>Teams had re­sumed full train­ing only on Sept 1.</p>
    <p>Foot­ballers from all eight lo­cal­based sides – Balestier Khalsa, Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional, Hougang United, Lion City Sailors, Tampines Rovers, Tan­jong Pa­gar United,</p>
    <p>Young Lions, and Ja­panese out­fit Al­birex Ni­igata – had been tested at the for­mer Siglap Sec­ondary School in Pasir Ris, as were SPL match of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Coaches and team of­fi­cials at each of these clubs were not tested as they are ex­pected to re­main masked up dur­ing games.</p>
    <p>The ninth team in the SPL are de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons Brunei DPMM, who are based in Ban­dar Seri Be­gawan and whose par­tic­i­pa­tion for the re­main­der of the sea­son is in se­ri­ous doubt as the team have yet to re­sume full train­ing.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 tests are ex­pected to be con­ducted ev­ery fort­night and games will be played with­out fans when the SPL re­sumes.</p>
    <p>Pre­cau­tions in place will be sim­i­lar to when the league moved to</p>
    <p>Lion City Sailors de­fender Ta­jeli Sala­mat re­ceiv­ing a sticker be­fore en­ter­ing the swab test cen­tre. With 16 retests for Covid-19 con­ducted yes­ter­day, the wait is ex­pected to push back the re­sump­tion date of the Sin­ga­pore Premier League, which has been on ice since March 24. closed-door matches shortly be­fore its sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>There will also likely be changes to the for­mat of do­mes­tic league and cup com­pe­ti­tions, with a view to re­duc­ing the to­tal num­ber of games played. Orig­i­nally, teams in the league were sched­uled to play one an­other thrice.</p>
