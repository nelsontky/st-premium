    <p>For many, they are sim­ply a pest, but for Sin­ga­porean en­tre­pre­neur John Ye, his per­sonal in­ter­est in the hum­ble ant prompted him to launch a busi­ness sell­ing in­sects that he be­lieves have a lot to of­fer us.</p>
    <p>Mr Ye opened Sin­ga­pore’s first shop spe­cial­is­ing in pet ants, Just Ants, in late Fe­bru­ary as lock­down mea­sures to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus kicked in.</p>
    <p>De­spite the ini­tial chal­lenges dur­ing the pan­demic, he said sales have picked up since July.</p>
    <p>“The ant it­self is just re­ally amaz­ing,” said Mr Ye, 41, who used to sell whole­sale elec­tron­ics and started rais­ing ants as a per­sonal hobby in 2017.</p>
    <p>While ant farms are more com­mon in some Western coun­tries, they are a rar­ity in Sin­ga­pore and Mr Ye is try­ing to change neg­a­tive con­no­ta­tions as­so­ci­ated with the in­sect.</p>
    <p>“They are so im­por­tant in the ecosys­tem, they are ac­tu­ally here for a rea­son, and... if we could ac­tu­ally just learn from the hum­ble ant, there are so many things that the ant could teach us, like per­se­ver­ance, be­ing head­strong,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ye hopes to col­lab­o­rate with in­sti­tu­tions such as schools, to teach chil­dren about ants and their life cy­cle.</p>
    <p>The ants he sells are lo­cally ac­quired by him and his staff from around the is­land. Mr Ye said they of­ten emerge after rain­storms.</p>
    <p>His shop of­fers 30 species of ants sold in starter kit ant farms, or formi­car­i­ums, which in­clude ants and a queen.</p>
    <p>Prices range from $13.90 to be­tween $200 and $300, de­pend­ing on the type of formi­car­ium and ant species.</p>
    <p>Just Ants also sells live worms as food for the ants. Mr Ye said the in­sects are also fond of honey and fruit.</p>
    <p>His busi­ness has drawn ant lovers and cu­ri­ous on­look­ers alike.</p>
    <p>Said shop­per Alvin Teng: “It’s crazy, def­i­nitely it’s crazy.”</p>
