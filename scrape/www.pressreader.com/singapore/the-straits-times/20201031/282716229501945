    <p>LONDON • Barcelona pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Vic­tor Font is stak­ing his elec­tion bid on bring­ing Manch­ester City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola back to the Nou Camp.</p>
    <p>For­mer pres­i­dent Josep Maria Bar­tomeu and the en­tire board of di­rec­tors at the La Liga club re­signed ear­lier this week, leav­ing a power vac­uum that will only be filled af­ter the elec­tions – orig­i­nally set for March but now set to be brought for­ward – are held.</p>
    <p>Font told Sky Sports yes­ter­day: “Most of the best pro­fes­sion­als who know about this style are also fans and love the club, like Pep and (other for­mer play­ers) Xavi, An­dres Ini­esta, Car­les Puyol.</p>
    <p>“They are all leg­ends that love Barcelona but do not work for Barca to­day. We need to bring them back to en­sure we will have a very com­pet­i­tive project.”</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola is into the fi­nal 12 months of his con­tract at the Eti­had and with no new deal agreed yet, there is spec­u­la­tion a sec­ond man­age­rial spell with his boy­hood club may prove too hard to re­sist.</p>
    <p>The Cata­lan won mul­ti­ple tro­phies with the Span­ish gi­ants in a four-year spell un­til 2012, land­ing four suc­ces­sive league and two</p>
    <p>Champions League ti­tles.</p>
    <p>Since leav­ing Barca, Euro­pean glory with Bay­ern Mu­nich and City has proved elu­sive but the 49-year-old yes­ter­day in­sisted he wished to “stay longer”.</p>
    <p>At his vir­tual pre-match press con­fer­ence ahead of City’s Premier League trip to 19th-placed Sheffield United to­day, Guardi­ola said: “I am in­cred­i­bly happy here. I’m de­lighted to be in Manch­ester and I hope I can do a good job this sea­son to stay longer.”</p>
    <p>Since join­ing in 2016, he has al­ready stayed longer with City than any of his pre­vi­ous teams, and a con­tract ex­ten­sion will be much more forth­com­ing should his team wrest the league ti­tle from Liverpool and se­cure a maiden Euro­pean Cup.</p>
    <p>In­juries have, how­ever, dis­rupted their start to this sea­son, al­though Guardi­ola claimed their plight had been made worse by a short­ened pre-sea­son break and a fix­ture list com­pressed by the de­mands of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Un­like other leagues in Europe, the Premier League voted against five sub­sti­tutes this sea­son with smaller clubs fear­ful the rule change would favour big­ger squads.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Guardi­ola is hope­ful au­thor­i­ties can re­vert to five sub­sti­tutes, as was the case af­ter the com­pe­ti­tion re­sumed in June last term.</p>
    <p>“Def­i­nitely they should, they should 100 per cent,” he said. “It’s not about one club. There are statis­tics that they don’t deny – that in the Premier League, play­ers have 47 per cent more mus­cu­lar in­juries than the pre­vi­ous sea­son, due to no prepa­ra­tion for most of the teams and the amount of games.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, they can re­con­sider and do what the rest of the world does be­cause we have to ad­just to the pan­demic sit­u­a­tion and other things.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is com­pletely dif­fer­ent now to be­fore. In­tel­li­gent peo­ple ad­just to the sit­u­a­tion in the world – foot­ball is about the play­ers. We’ll see.”</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola also added that his team, 13th in the league, would be with­out Ser­gio Aguero and Ben­jamin Mendy at Bra­mall Lane, but Nathan Ake and Gabriel Je­sus could make their re­turn from in­jury.</p>
    <p>CITY FOR THE AGES</p>
    <p>I am in­cred­i­bly happy here. I’m de­lighted to be in Manch­ester and I hope I can do a good job this sea­son to stay longer. ’’</p>
