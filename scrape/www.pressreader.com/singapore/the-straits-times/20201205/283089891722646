    <p>When it comes to road cars, the words “Mercedes-Benz” and “thrilling” rarely ap­pear to­gether.</p>
    <p>But the new CLA 45S is not your usual Merc. In fact, it prob­a­bly has more in com­mon dy­nam­i­cally with the Mercedes-Benz which Lewis Hamil­ton drives ev­ery other Sun­day than with an S-class.</p>
    <p>Un­der its bon­net is a hand-built 2-litre twin-scroll tur­bocharged four-cylin­der mak­ing a mon­u­men­tal 421hp and 500Nm. It is the world’s most pow­er­ful pro­duc­tion four-pot and a far more so­phis­ti­cated unit than the sim­i­larly sized 306hp en­gine in the CLA 35.</p>
    <p>The out­put is sent to four wheels via an eight-speed, dual-clutch gear­box. Torque is jug­gled not just be­tween the front and rear axles, but also be­tween the two rear wheels, giv­ing the tail a touch of mo­bil­ity to help an­gle the car into a turn.</p>
    <p>While the en­gine’s red­line is at 7,000rpm, it is mus­cu­lar from al­most idle speed. Off the lights, the car sim­ply bolts away, with thrust build­ing in­ex­orably as the rev nee­dle rips round the dial. It hits 100kmh in just 4 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>The car’s sound­track is equally hair-rais­ing, es­pe­cially in its sportier drive modes. At idle, there is a pur­pose­ful, hard-edged purr. And as revs rise, the noise grows in fe­roc­ity and vol­ume, reach­ing a howl­ing crescendo at the red­line.</p>
    <p>More sig­nif­i­cantly, the new car is a far more en­ter­tain­ing steer than its pre­de­ces­sor, which was also sear­ingly fast in a straight line, but had a de­press­ingly staid chas­sis.</p>
    <p>Its al­can­tara-clad steer­ing wheel has just the right de­gree of re­sis­tance and its nose re­sponds by flick­ing in­stantly into bends. Di­rec­tion changes are ra­zor-sharp yet lin­ear, with a sense of the whole car ro­tat­ing in­stead of the rear axle merely trail­ing along.</p>
    <p>Grip is ut­terly tena­cious and with all-wheel-drive, you can open the throt­tle very early in a cor­ner without fear of wheel­spin or un­der­steer. The brakes are phe­nom­e­nally strong as well, with a re­as­sur­ingly firm pedal.</p>
    <p>There are four drive modes – se­lectable ei­ther by a tog­gle on the cen­tre con­sole or a Porsche-style ro­tary dial on the steer­ing wheel.</p>
    <p>In the more ex­treme modes – Sport+ and Race – there is an al­most pal­pa­ble sense of the car tens­ing up as the throt­tle re­sponse sharp­ens, gear changes punch through with more fe­roc­ity, the ex­haust gets ex­tra snarl and crackle and the sus­pen­sion gains a firmer, more pur­pose­ful edge.</p>
    <p>Yet, even in this set-up, the ride is taut yet fluid, with the car re­main­ing re­mark­ably com­pli­ant over bumps – a far cry from the buck­ing ride that blighted its pre­de­ces­sor and al­most ev­ery other last­gen­er­a­tion Mercedes A-class de­riv­a­tive. In fact, it de­fies be­lief that it rolls so lit­tle yet rides so well.</p>
    <p>Ease the drive mode back to Sport or Com­fort and the AMG morphs into an ut­terly civilised cruiser, waft­ing along with its en­gine note a dis­tant hum.</p>
    <p>Be­ly­ing its per­for­mance, the CLA 45S is out­wardly un­der­stated, es­pe­cially in the test car’s metal­lic grey. There are gap­ing in­takes on the front bumper, huge red six-pis­ton brake cal­lipers on the front wheels, and front wings which are sub­tly wider than those on the reg­u­lar CLA. But those are about the only hints to its po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>In­side, it is largely A-class generic, with twin 10.25-inch TFT screens packed with all end­less vir­tual gad­getry, such as five in­stru­ment dis­play lay­outs and 10 choices of am­bi­ent-light­ing colour schemes. There is even an app for race-rack per­for­mance track­ing.</p>
    <p>Space is ad­e­quate if not gen­er­ous and given this car’s top-dog sta­tus in the CLA range, equip­ment lev­els are high ex­cept for the ab­sence of rear air-vents.</p>
    <p>Still, no one buys this car for mun­dane things like cabin space or equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Rather, they will be af­ter sheer driv­ing ex­hil­a­ra­tion in a com­pact sedan. On that front, the CLA 45S is sim­ply peer­less.</p>
