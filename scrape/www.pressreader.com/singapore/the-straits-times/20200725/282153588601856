    <p>Af­ter six years of be­ing cancer-free, Madam Peggy Tay, 71, was dis­traught to find out in Jan­uary last year that her lym­phoma – a cancer that at­tacks in­fec­tion-fight­ing white blood cells – had re­turned.</p>
    <p>Hers was a par­tic­u­larly ag­gres­sive type of lym­phoma called Dif­fuse Large B-cell Lym­phoma (DLBCL).</p>
    <p>She re­sponded briefly to sal­vage chemo­ther­apy, a stan­dard treat­ment for re­lapsed lym­phoma. But the dis­ease resur­faced again in Septem­ber last year.</p>
    <p>This time, how­ever, she re­ceived a life­line in the form of an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence dig­i­tal medicine plat­form de­vel­oped by re­searchers of the Cancer Sci­ence In­sti­tute of Sin­ga­pore (CSI Sin­ga­pore) at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It helped to de­rive and cus­tomise the most ef­fec­tive drug for her.</p>
    <p>The AI plat­form – called Quadratic Pheno­typic Op­ti­mi­sa­tion Plat­form (QPOP) – an­a­lysed a small tu­mour sam­ple taken from her and ranked her cancer cells’ po­ten­tial re­sponse to more than 530,000 drug com­bi­na­tions with 12 types of drugs used for lym­phoma.</p>
    <p>In less t han a week, QPOP showed that Madam Tay’s cancer was vul­ner­a­ble to a com­bi­na­tion of two drugs, pal­bo­ci­clib and everolimus, which has been used only for breast cancer.</p>
    <p>Erring on the side of cau­tion, her med­i­cal team de­cided to put her on a stan­dard chemo­ther­apy treat­ment for re­lapsed lym­phoma called R-GDP last Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>But, as pre­dicted by the AI plat­form, it made things worse.</p>
    <p>“That chemo re­ally hated my body. I was breath­less and my body was weak­ened, I had high fever, I lost a lot of weight and I just wasn’t able to un­der­stand my body,” said Madam Tay.</p>
    <p>In­stead of re­spond­ing to the gru­elling treat­ment, the tu­mour in her chest also grew big­ger, said As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Anand Jeyasekha­ran, the on­col­o­gist who treated her at the Na­tional Univer­sity Cancer In­sti­tute, Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It was back to the draw­ing board for the re­search team and they de­cided to give QPOP’s rec­om­men­da­tion a try last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Madam Tay and her daugh­ter were also ea­ger for her to try it when they heard the drug com­bi­na­tion re­sponded well to her tu­mour sam­ple.</p>
    <p>Within two weeks of tak­ing the oral anti-cancer pill, her high fever went away.</p>
    <p>Five months into tak­ing the med­i­ca­tion, her chest tu­mour dis­ap­peared and she is now in re­mis­sion. The only side ef­fects she suf­fered were rashes and blis­ters on her leg.</p>
    <p>Prof Jeyasekha­ran, who is also a re­searcher at CSI Sin­ga­pore, de­scribed re­lapsed DLBCL as an area of “un­met clin­i­cal need”. He said: “Pa­tients with a dis­ease that is re­sis­tant to more than two lines of chemo­ther­apy do poorly. CAR-T cell treat­ment is promis­ing, but cost can be a key con­sid­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>Two lines of chemo­ther­apy re­fer to the ini­tial treat­ment and a sub­se­quent one while CAR-T cell treat­ment is a form of im­munother­apy that uses spe­cially al­tered T-cells in the im­mune sys­tem to fight cancer.</p>
    <p>But the CAR-T treat­ment is not yet avail­able out­side of clin­i­cal tri­als here, and can cost $500,000, said Prof Jeyasekha­ran.</p>
    <p>For 31 out of 36 pa­tients, QPOP (AI plat­form) was able to come up with po­ten­tial treat­ment re­ports. It pre­dicted that stan­dard treat­ments would not help in 18 of the cases. Four of those were of­fered drug com­bi­na­tions used be­fore in the clinic.</p>
    <p>For the rest, QPOP de­rived drug com­bi­na­tions that had never been tested on any cancer be­fore, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Edward Chow, leader of the team that de­vel­oped QPOP.</p>
    <p>Madam Tay’s treat­ment cost about $4,000 a month and it lasted five months.</p>
    <p>On the re­search front, she was one of 36 pa­tients who agreed to have their tu­mour and blood sam­ples run through QPOP for a clin­i­cal re­search study headed by As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Edward Chow, prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor at CSI Sin­ga­pore and leader of the team that de­vel­oped QPOP.</p>
    <p>Work on the AI plat­form started in 2014, and the clin­i­cal study be­gan in 2018.</p>
    <p>For 31 out of 36 pa­tients, QPOP was able to come up with po­ten­tial treat­ment re­ports. It pre­dicted that stan­dard treat­ments would not help in 18 of the cases. Four of those, in­clud­ing Madam Tay, were of­fered drug com­bi­na­tions used be­fore in the clinic.</p>
    <p>For the rest, QPOP de­rived drug com­bi­na­tions that had never been tested on any cancer be­fore, said Prof Chow. “But QPOP pro­vided a back­log of in­for­ma­tion for fu­ture clin­i­cal re­search on some of these po­ten­tially in­ter­est­ing com­bi­na­tions,” he added.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers’ next step is to raise funds to con­duct a clin­i­cal trial in­volv­ing 60 pa­tients with re­lapsed lym­phoma.</p>
