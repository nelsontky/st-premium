    <p>• Fifty-nine top com­puter sci­en­tists and elec­tion se­cu­rity ex­perts in the US have re­buked Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s base­less claims of voter fraud and hack­ing, writ­ing that such as­ser­tions are “un­sub­stan­ti­ated or are tech­ni­cally in­co­her­ent”.</p>
    <p>The re­but­tal, in a let­ter to be pub­lished on var­i­ous web­sites, did not men­tion Mr Trump by name but amounted to another force­ful cor­rec­tive to the tor­rents of dis­in­for­ma­tion that he has posted on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“Any­one as­sert­ing that a US elec­tion was ‘rigged’ is mak­ing an ex­tra­or­di­nary claim, one that must be sup­ported by per­sua­sive and ver­i­fi­able ev­i­dence,” the sci­en­tists wrote on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of ev­i­dence, it is “sim­ply spec­u­la­tion”, they said.</p>
    <p>“To our col­lec­tive knowl­edge, no cred­i­ble ev­i­dence has been put forth that sup­ports a con­clu­sion that the 2020 elec­tion out­come in any state has been al­tered through tech­ni­cal com­pro­mise,” they wrote.</p>
    <p>The let­ter fol­lowed a sim­i­larly strong re­but­tal of Mr Trump’s un­founded al­le­ga­tions by the Elec­tions In­fra­struc­ture Gov­ern­ment Co­or­di­nat­ing Coun­cil, which in­cludes top of­fi­cials from the De­part­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity’s cy­ber se­cu­rity agency, the US Elec­tion As­sis­tance Com­mis­sion, as well as sec­re­taries of state and state elec­tion di­rec­tors from around the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In a joint state­ment last Thurs­day, the coun­cil de­clared that the 2020 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion “was the most se­cure in Amer­i­can his­tory” and that “there is no ev­i­dence” any vot­ing sys­tems had been com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>Some of those of­fi­cials expect to be fired in the com­ing weeks for their re­fusal to echo Mr Trump’s claims.</p>
    <p>Over the past week, he has tweeted var­i­ous con­spir­acy the­o­ries in­volv­ing Do­min­ion, a ma­jor sup­plier of vot­ing ma­chines, and other elec­tion tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Among the al­le­ga­tions, he wrote that Do­min­ion ma­chines had “deleted 2.7 mil­lion Trump votes na­tion­wide”, a claim with no ba­sis in fact.</p>
    <p>Of five coun­ties that ex­pe­ri­enced dif­fer­ent soft­ware prob­lems on elec­tion day i n Michi­gan and Ge­or­gia, only two had used Do­min­ion soft­ware, and in each case, the prob­lems were fixed and did not af­fect re­sults.</p>
