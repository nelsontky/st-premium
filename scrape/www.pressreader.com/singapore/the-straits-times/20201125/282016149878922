    <p>Con­spir­acy the­o­ries come in all shapes and sizes, but per­haps the most com­mon form is the Global Ca­bal the­ory.</p>
    <p>A re­cent sur­vey of 26,000 peo­ple in 25 coun­tries asked re­spon­dents whether they be­lieve there is “a sin­gle group of peo­ple who se­cretly con­trols events and rule the world to­gether”.</p>
    <p>Thirty-seven per cent of Amer­i­cans replied that this is “def­i­nitely or prob­a­bly true”. So did 45 per cent of Ital­ians, 55 per cent of Spa­niards and 78 per cent of Nige­ri­ans.</p>
    <p>Con­spir­acy the­o­ries, of course, weren’t in­vented by QAnon; they’ve been around for thou­sands of years. Some of them have even had a huge im­pact on his­tory.</p>
    <p>Take Nazism, for ex­am­ple. We nor­mally don’t think about Nazism as a con­spir­acy the­ory. Since it man­aged to take over an en­tire coun­try and launch World War II, we usu­ally con­sider Nazism an “ide­ol­ogy”, al­beit an evil one.</p>
    <p>But at its heart, Nazism was a Global Ca­bal the­ory based on this anti-Semitic lie: “A ca­bal of Jewish fi­nanciers se­cretly dom­i­nates the world and are plot­ting to de­stroy the Aryan race. They en­gi­neered the Bol­she­vik Rev­o­lu­tion, run West­ern democ­ra­cies, and con­trol the me­dia and the banks. Only Hitler has man­aged to see through all their ne­far­i­ous tricks – and only he can stop them and save hu­man­ity.”</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ing the com­mon struc­ture of such Global Ca­bal the­o­ries can ex­plain both their at­trac­tive­ness – and their in­her­ent false­hood.</p>
    <p>THE STRUC­TURE</p>
    <p>Global Ca­bal the­o­ries ar­gue that un­der­neath the myr­iad events we see on the sur­face of the world lurks a sin­gle sin­is­ter group. The iden­tity of this group may change: Some be­lieve the world is se­cretly ruled by Freema­sons, witches or Satanists; oth­ers think it’s aliens, rep­til­ian lizard-peo­ple or sundry other cliques.</p>
    <p>But the ba­sic struc­ture re­mains the same: The group con­trols al­most ev­ery­thing that hap­pens, while si­mul­ta­ne­ously con­ceal­ing this con­trol.</p>
    <p>Global Ca­bal the­o­ries take par­tic­u­lar de­light in unit­ing op­po­sites. Thus, the Nazi con­spir­acy the­ory said that on the sur­face, com­mu­nism and cap­i­tal­ism look like ir­rec­on­cil­able en­e­mies, right? Wrong! That’s ex­actly what the Jewish ca­bal wants you to think! And you might think that the Bush fam­ily and the Clin­ton fam­ily are sworn ri­vals, but they’re just putting on a show – be­hind closed doors, they all go to the same Tup­per­ware par­ties.</p>
    <p>From these premises, a work­ing the­ory of the world emerges. Events in the news are a cun­ningly de­signed smoke screen aimed at de­ceiv­ing us, and the fa­mous lead­ers that dis­tract our at­ten­tion are mere pup­pets in the hands of the real rulers.</p>
    <p>THE LURE</p>
    <p>Global Ca­bal the­o­ries are able to at­tract large fol­low­ings in part be­cause they of­fer a sin­gle, straight­for­ward ex­pla­na­tion to count­less com­pli­cated pro­cesses. Our lives are re­peat­edly rocked by wars, rev­o­lu­tions, crises and pan­demics. But if I be­lieve some kind of Global Ca­bal the­ory, I en­joy the com­fort­ing feel­ing that I do un­der­stand ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>The war in Syria? I don’t need to study Mid­dle Eastern his­tory to com­pre­hend what’s hap­pen­ing there. It’s part of the big con­spir­acy. The de­vel­op­ment of 5G tech­nol­ogy? I don’t need to do any re­search on the physics of ra­dio waves. It’s the con­spir­acy. The Covid-19 pan­demic? It has noth­ing to do with ecosys­tems, bats and viruses. It’s ob­vi­ously part of the con­spir­acy.</p>
    <p>The skele­ton key of Global Ca­bal the­ory un­locks all the world’s mys­ter­ies and of­fers me en­tree into an ex­clu­sive cir­cle – the group of peo­ple who un­der­stand. It makes me smarter and wiser than the av­er­age per­son, and even el­e­vates me above the in­tel­lec­tual elite and the rul­ing class: pro­fes­sors, jour­nal­ists, politi­cians. I see what they over­look – or what they try to con­ceal.</p>
    <p>THE FLAW</p>
    <p>Global Ca­bal the­o­ries suf­fer from the same ba­sic flaw: They as­sume that his­tory is very sim­ple.</p>
    <p>The key premise of Global Ca­bal the­o­ries is that it is rel­a­tively easy to ma­nip­u­late the world. A small group of peo­ple can un­der­stand, pre­dict and con­trol ev­ery­thing, from wars to tech­no­log­i­cal rev­o­lu­tions to pan­demics.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­u­larly re­mark­able is this group’s abil­ity to see 10 moves ahead on the global board game.</p>
    <p>When they re­lease a virus some­where, they can pre­dict not only how it will spread through the world, but also how it will af­fect the global econ­omy a year later. When they un­leash a po­lit­i­cal rev­o­lu­tion, they can con­trol its course. When they start a war, they know how it will end.</p>
    <p>But, of course, the world is much more com­pli­cated.</p>
    <p>Con­sider the Amer­i­can in­va­sion of Iraq, for ex­am­ple. In 2003, the world’s sole su­per­power in­vaded a medium-sized Mid­dle Eastern coun­try, claim­ing it wanted to elim­i­nate the coun­try’s weapons of mass de­struc­tion and end Sad­dam Hus­sein’s regime. Some sus­pected that it also wouldn’t have minded the chance to gain hege­mony over the re­gion and dom­i­nate the vi­tal Iraqi oil fields.</p>
    <p>In pur­suit of its goals, the United States de­ployed the best army in the world and spent tril­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>Fast for­ward a few years, and what were the re­sults of this tremen­dous ef­fort? A com­plete de­ba­cle. There were no weapons of mass de­struc­tion and the coun­try was plunged into chaos. The big win­ner of the war was ac­tu­ally Iran, which be­came the dom­i­nant power in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>So should we con­clude that Ge­orge W. Bush and Don­ald Rums­feld were ac­tu­ally un­der­cover Ira­nian moles, ex­e­cut­ing a dev­il­ishly clever Ira­nian plot? Not at all. In­stead, the con­clu­sion is that it is in­cred­i­bly dif­fi­cult to pre­dict and con­trol hu­man af­fairs.</p>
    <p>You don’t need to in­vade a Mid­dle Eastern coun­try to learn this les­son. Whether you’ve served on a school board or lo­cal coun­cil, or merely tried to or­gan­ise a sur­prise birth­day party for your mum, you prob­a­bly know how dif­fi­cult it is to con­trol hu­mans. You make a plan, and it back­fires. You try to keep some­thing a se­cret, and the next day every­body is talk­ing about it.</p>
    <p>You con­spire with a trusted friend, and at the cru­cial mo­ment, they stab you in the back.</p>
    <p>Global Ca­bal the­o­ries ask us to be­lieve that while it is very dif­fi­cult to pre­dict and con­trol the ac­tions of 1,000 or even 100 hu­mans, it is sur­pris­ingly easy to pup­pet mas­ter nearly eight bil­lion.</p>
    <p>THE RE­AL­ITY</p>
    <p>There are, of course, many real con­spir­a­cies in the world. In­di­vid­u­als, cor­po­ra­tions, or­gan­i­sa­tions, churches, fac­tions and gov­ern­ments are con­stantly hatch­ing and pur­su­ing var­i­ous plots. But that is pre­cisely what makes it so hard to pre­dict and con­trol the world in its en­tirety.</p>
    <p>In the 1930s, the Soviet Union re­ally was con­spir­ing to ig­nite com­mu­nist rev­o­lu­tions through­out the world; cap­i­tal­ist banks were em­ploy­ing all kinds of dodgy strate­gies; the Roo­sevelt ad­min­is­tra­tion was plan­ning to re-en­gi­neer Amer­i­can so­ci­ety in the New Deal; and the Zion­ist move­ment pur­sued its plan to es­tab­lish a home­land in Pales­tine.</p>
    <p>But these, and count­less other schemes, of­ten col­lided and there wasn’t a sin­gle group of peo­ple run­ning the whole show.</p>
    <p>Today, too, you are prob­a­bly the tar­get of many con­spir­a­cies. Your co-work­ers may be plot­ting to turn the boss against you. A big phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal cor­po­ra­tion may be brib­ing your doc­tor to give you harm­ful opi­oids. Another big cor­po­ra­tion may be pres­sur­ing politi­cians to block en­vi­ron­men­tal reg­u­la­tions and al­low it to pol­lute the air you breathe. Some tech gi­ant may be busy hack­ing your pri­vate data. A for­eign gov­ern­ment may be try­ing to fo­ment ex­trem­ism in your coun­try. These could all be real con­spir­a­cies, but they are not part of a sin­gle global plot.</p>
    <p>Some­times, a cor­po­ra­tion, a po­lit­i­cal party or a dic­ta­tor does man­age to gather a sig­nif­i­cant part of all the world’s power into its hands. But when such a thing hap­pens, it’s al­most im­pos­si­ble to keep it hush-hush. With great power comes great pub­lic­ity.</p>
    <p>In­deed, in many cases, great pub­lic­ity is a pre­req­ui­site for gain­ing great power. Lenin, for ex­am­ple, would never have won power in Rus­sia by avoid­ing the pub­lic gaze. And Stalin, at first, was much fonder of schem­ing be­hind closed doors, but by the time he mo­nop­o­lised power in the Soviet Union, his por­trait was hang­ing in ev­ery of­fice, school and home from the Baltic to the Pa­cific. Stalin’s power de­pended on this per­son­al­ity cult. The idea that Lenin and Stalin were just a front for the real be­hind-the-scenes rulers con­tra­dicts all his­tor­i­cal ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>Re­al­is­ing that no sin­gle ca­bal can se­cretly con­trol the en­tire world is not just ac­cu­rate – it is also em­pow­er­ing. It means that you can iden­tify the com­pet­ing fac­tions in our world, and ally your­self with some groups against oth­ers. That’s what real pol­i­tics is all about.</p>
    <p>There are, of course, many real con­spir­a­cies in the world. In­di­vid­u­als, cor­po­ra­tions, or­gan­i­sa­tions, churches, fac­tions and gov­ern­ments are con­stantly hatch­ing and pur­su­ing var­i­ous plots. But that is pre­cisely what makes it so hard to pre­dict and con­trol the world in its en­tirety.</p>
