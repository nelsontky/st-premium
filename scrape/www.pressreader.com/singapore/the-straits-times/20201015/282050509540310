    <p>More let­ter­boxes have been tam­pered with in var­i­ous Hous­ing Board estates is­land­wide, with gro­cery vouch­ers meant for low­er­in­come Sin­ga­pore­ans al­legedly stolen from them.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said yes­ter­day that they have re­ceived re­ports of such in­ci­dents in res­i­den­tial ar­eas, in­clud­ing Mar­sil­ing and Bukit Merah, and a case of mis­chief at Block 89 Red­hill Close. They are in­ves­ti­gat­ing these cases.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter SingPost said that let­ter­boxes at blocks in Red­hill and Lengkok Bahru were found forcibly pried open on Tues­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>The af­fected blocks were 55, 56, 57, 58 and 59 in Lengkok Bahru; 71 and 72 in Red­hill Road; and 89 and 90 in Red­hill Close.</p>
    <p>A 37-year-old wo­man was ar­rested on Sun­day on sus­pi­cion of steal­ing Bud­get 2020 gro­cery vouch­ers from let­ter­boxes i n Lorong 7 Toa Payoh.</p>
    <p>It was the sec­ond such ar­rest in two months. On Sept 11, five 18-year-olds were ap­pre­hended for al­leged theft of parcels from six blocks of HDB flats in Choa Chu Kang.</p>
    <p>Those who are found guilty of theft can be jailed for up to three years, fined, or both.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book ad­vi­sory, the po­lice ad­vised those el­i­gi­ble for the Bud­get 2020 gro­cery vouch­ers to col­lect them from their let­ter­boxes as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Those who sus­pect that their vouch­ers have been stolen should make a po­lice re­port im­me­di­ately and call the Gro­cery Voucher hot­line on 1800-2222-888 to re­quest for their vouch­ers to be voided and re­placed.</p>
    <p>The po­lice also urged peo­ple to en­sure that their let­ter­boxes are se­cured at all times and to re­port any sus­pi­cious per­sons loi­ter­ing around let­ter­boxes to the po­lice.</p>
