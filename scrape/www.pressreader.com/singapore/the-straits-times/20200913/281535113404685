    <p>An early morn­ing car chase from the Cen­tral Ex­press­way (CTE) to Can­berra Street led to the ar­rest of a 31-year-old driver yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>His male pas­sen­ger is still at large af­ter flee­ing on foot af­ter the car mounted a kerb and crashed into a tree.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said that at about 1.10am, Traf­fic Po­lice of­fi­cers were pa­trolling along CTE to­wards Sele­tar Ex­press­way, near Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 1, when they came across a driver who was driv­ing at a rel­a­tively slow speed on the ex­treme right lane.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cer sig­nalled to the driver to stop the car so that they could con­duct a check, but he re­fused and sped off.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cers gave chase.</p>
    <p>In a video up­loaded on Face­book page SG Road Vig­i­lante, a white hatch­back is seen driv­ing against traf­fic at high speed.</p>
    <p>On the other side of the road, at least three po­lice ve­hi­cles, in­clud­ing two mo­tor­cy­cles and a car, are seen chas­ing the white car.</p>
    <p>It sub­se­quently mounted a kerb in Can­berra Street and crashed into a tree, said the po­lice.</p>
    <p>The driver was ar­rested for dan­ger­ous driv­ing, driv­ing with­out a valid driv­ing li­cence and sus­pected drug-re­lated of­fences. He was con­scious when taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal and no in­juries to other peo­ple were re­ported.</p>
    <p>The po­lice are seek­ing the male pas­sen­ger to as­sist with in­ves­ti­ga­tions. He was seen in the video run­ning away from the scene into ad­ja­cent hous­ing blocks, pur­sued by po­lice of­fi­cers on foot.</p>
    <p>Po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
