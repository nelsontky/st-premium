Hayabusa2 space probe. Asteroids, believed to have formed at the dawn of the solar system, could contain organic matter that contribute­d to life on
Earth. Capsule lands at Woomera, South Australia on Sunday. Solar array panels HAYABUSA2 The spacecraft, whose name means falcon in Japanese, is about the size of a large fridge. Mascot Weight 609kg Impactor Sampler horn How rovers are deployed The probe lowers itself to 55m above the asteroid’s surface. Robots are then deployed. The probe then rises to 20km. CAPSULE RETURN ASTEROID RYUGU Diameter: About 880m Orbit ‘Ryugu’ means Dragon Palace in Japanese Hayabusa2 releases capsule 1 TIMELINE
2010
This mission follows the seven-year odyssey by predecesso­r Hayabusa, which returned in 2010 with asteroid samples. Probe Altitude: 200km 55m 2 Asteroid Spacecraft films fireball Taking samples
A carry-on impactor creates an artificial impact crater by firing a 2kg copper bullet at the surface. December 2014 Launched in Japan 3 Parachute deployed and heat shield separates June 2018 Arrived at Ryugu Impactor Probe stays clear of blast. Sept 21, 2018
In a world first , Hayabusa2 dispatched two rovers that landed on the asteroid Ryugu. Altitude: 10km Oct 3, 2018
The Mascot observatio­n robot was also successful­ly deployed. Beacon tracks descent 4 Sampler horn sucks up fresh materials from crater. December 2020 Returned to Earth 5 Capsule lands ROVERS
The two rovers, known jointly as Minerva-II1, bounce on Ryugu’s surface because of its low gravity, taking photograph­s and gathering data using temperatur­e and optical sensors and cameras. This rover, deployed on Oct 3, carried magnetic temperatur­e and optical sensors. Its lifespan was only 17 hours. The rover tumbled around with the help of an oscillatin­g weight lever.
