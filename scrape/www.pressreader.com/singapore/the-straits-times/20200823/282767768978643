    <p>Dian Rahma Bakti</p>
    <p>The Jakarta Post, In­done­sia</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko “Jokowi” Wi­dodo re­cently urged the Pad­jad­jaran Univer­sity re­search team to ex­pe­dite the trial phase for a po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine to just three months, but clin­i­cal trial co­or­di­na­tor pro­fes­sor Kus­nandi Rus­mil said it would be im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Al­most all ex­perts agree that even an 18-month tar­get for a Covid-19 vac­cine is too op­ti­mistic, so the best-case sce­nario could see a work­ing vac­cine in the sec­ond or third quar­ter of 2021. History shows it took 26 years to de­velop a vac­cine for the hu­man pa­pil­lo­mavirus and 25 years to se­cure one for the ro­tavirus.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, in the case of Covid-19, sci­en­tists al­ready have a big head start, as they are re­ly­ing on ground­work from Se­vere Acute Res­pi­ra­tory Syn­drome (Sars) and Mid­dle East Res­pi­ra­tory Syn­drome (Mers) out­breaks in 2003 and 2012, re­spec­tively. Sars and Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, are roughly 80 per cent iden­ti­cal.</p>
    <p>So, re­searchers al­ready know a good tar­get for a vac­cine: the spike pro­tein that sits on the sur­face of the virus, and es­pe­cially the part that binds to hu­man cells, en­abling the virus to gain en­try. The sci­en­tists are al­ready on the fast track and they can move to fo­cus on other cru­cial parts ahead – the tri­als.</p>
    <p>As a rule, re­searchers don’t be­gin test­ing ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines on peo­ple un­til after rig­or­ous safety checks. It starts with a pre-clin­i­cal tox­i­col­ogy study on a lab­o­ra­tory scale that as­sesses whether a drug is safe to use and is tested on an­i­mals. That usu­ally takes three to six months, de­pend­ing on the study’s de­sign.</p>
    <p>There are sev­eral strate­gies nor­mally used to de­velop a vac­cine: an in­ac­ti­vated virus, a live at­ten­u­ated virus, or heav­ily weaken the virus’ strain, and pull out the virus ge­netic se­quence, DNA or ri­bonu­cleic acid (RNA).</p>
    <p>If the eval­u­a­tion is suc­cess­ful, the can­di­dates go through to the three phases of test­ing in peo­ple, also known as clin­i­cal tri­als. Each phase has its spe­cial treat­ments, du­ra­tion and reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The most time-con­sum­ing step is test­ing be­cause re­searchers have to wait for enough vol­un­teers to be ex­posed to a virus nat­u­rally. The vac­cine must be given to a much larger group and com­pared with an un­vac­ci­nated con­trol group to see whether it really pre­vents the dis­ease. Such a test needs thou­sands of peo­ple to as­sess the safety and rare ad­verse events.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal part be­fore the vac­cine can be launched to the mar­ket is gov­ern­ment ap­proval. We are deal­ing with a long, com­plex and ex­pen­sive process.</p>
    <p>Ab­dul­lah Shi­bli</p>
    <p>The Daily Star, Bangladesh</p>
    <p>“Vac­cine na­tion­al­ism” is threat­en­ing to make it dif­fi­cult for third-world coun­tries to se­cure in­ex­pen­sive and ad­e­quate sup­plies of re­li­able vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine na­tion­al­ism oc­curs when a coun­try man­ages to se­cure doses of vac­cine for its own cit­i­zens or res­i­dents be­fore they are made avail­able in other coun­tries. The bot­tom line is, vac­cine na­tion­al­ism will af­fect the dis­tri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines, which is likely to be based on high-in­come coun­tries’ pur­chas­ing power rather than the risk of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Not long ago, in a pa­per in the Har­vard Busi­ness Re­view, three sci­en­tists ex­pressed their con­cern over rich coun­tries bankrollin­g vac­cine de­vel­op­ment and leav­ing only the crumbs for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. They strongly re­jected such na­tion­al­is­tic re­sponses and voiced the need for a cen­tralised, trusted gov­er­nance sys­tem to en­sure ap­pro­pri­ate flow of cap­i­tal, in­for­ma­tion and sup­plies.</p>
    <p>It is ex­pected that a Covid-19 break­through could beget off-the-charts ex­pen­sive treat­ments. Some of the ex­ist­ing drugs that sci­en­tists are test­ing as Covid-19 treat­ments have a spe­cial sta­tus for rare dis­ease treat­ments, and the price tags to match – prompt­ing early warn­ings from aca­demics and drug pric­ing re­form ad­vo­cates that if one is ef­fec­tive, ac­cess could be a crit­i­cal is­sue.</p>
    <p>In the past, most high-in­come coun­tries turned to phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies within their own bor­ders for pro­duc­tion. High-in­come coun­tries di­rectly ne­go­ti­ated large ad­vance or­ders for the vac­cine, crowd­ing out poor coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Although sev­eral of those rich coun­tries, in­clud­ing the United States, agreed to make vac­cine do­na­tions to low- and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries, they only car­ried out these do­na­tions after en­sur­ing they could cover their own pop­u­la­tions first.</p>
    <p>But ac­cord­ing to WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus, “vac­cines only realise their true power when they are de­ployed to pro­tect the poor­est and most vul­ner­a­ble”.</p>
    <p>Ra­mon Farolan</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Daily In­quirer, Philip­pines</p>
    <p>Re­cently, Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin an­nounced that Rus­sia has granted reg­u­la­tory ap­proval to a Covid-19 vac­cine that showed “sta­ble im­mu­nity” against the new virus and had “passed all the nec­es­sary checks”.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine named “Sput­nik V” was de­vel­oped by Ga­ma­leya Re­search In­sti­tute of</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­ol­ogy and Mi­cro­bi­ol­ogy. On Aug 1, the Rus­sians an­nounced that the vac­cine passed through Phases 1 and 2 clin­i­cal tri­als. They re­ported not a sin­gle par­tic­i­pant of the tri­als got in­fected with</p>
    <p>Covid-19 after be­ing ad­min­is­tered with Sput­nik V.</p>
    <p>The CEO of the Rus­sian Di­rect In­vest­ment Fund that sup­ports the work of the Ga­ma­leya Re­search In­sti­tute, Mr Kir­ill Dmitriev, an­nounced the start of the cru­cial Phase 3 tri­als in­volv­ing 2,000 peo­ple in Rus­sia, the Mid­dle East, and Latin Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Mass pro­duc­tion of the vac­cine will be done by Rus­sian busi­ness con­glom­er­ate Sis­tema be­fore the end of the year. Mr Dmitriev said Rus­sia has re­ceived re­quests from more than 20 coun­tries for 1 billion doses of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Re­ac­tions from the Western world were swift and some­what sour.</p>
    <p>Dr An­thony Fauci, di­rec­tor of the US Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases, ex­pressed se­ri­ous doubts that the Rus­sians have ac­tu­ally proven that the vac­cine is safe.</p>
    <p>Dr Scott Got­tlieb, former US</p>
    <p>Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion com­mis­sioner, said much of the test­ing done was on too small a group. “I will not take it, cer­tainly not out­side clin­i­cal tri­als.”</p>
    <p>Let us ask our­selves this ques­tion: Is Mr Putin a mad­man that he will risk the safety, the good health, the well-be­ing and pos­si­bly, the lives of mil­lions of his peo­ple just to score po­lit­i­cal pro­pa­ganda points and gain some pres­tige for the na­tion? He is a lot smarter than some of his ri­vals on the world stage.</p>
    <p>With his an­nounce­ment, Rus­sia is sev­eral steps ahead of China, Ja­pan, the US and the United King­dom in the race for a vac­cine. This will spur every­one to work harder and faster and even come up with a bet­ter vac­cine than Sput­nik V.</p>
    <p>Mr Putin’s move is a master stroke and his tim­ing is im­pec­ca­ble.</p>
    <p>Ed­i­to­rial</p>
    <p>The States­man, In­dia</p>
    <p>Con­cerns raised by Amer­ica’s top in­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist, Dr An­thony Fauci, about the safety of vac­cines be­ing de­vel­oped by China and Rus­sia de­serve to be taken se­ri­ously. Rus­sia has claimed its vac­cine will be ready next month, but even if this hap­pens, the prod­uct is likely to face in­tense scru­tiny around the world. Some 160 can­di­dates, in­clud­ing eight in In­dia, are in var­i­ous stages of de­vel­op­ment, with 23 in clin­i­cal tri­als and six in the fi­nal, third-phase hu­man tri­als.</p>
    <p>Last month, China an­nounced that a vac­cine de­vel­oped by CanSino Bi­o­log­ics was be­ing used to im­mu­nise the na­tion’s mil­i­tary, caus­ing eth­i­cal con­cerns to be voiced by sev­eral sci­en­tists. Two other Chi­nese com­pa­nies, Si­no­vac and Si­nopharm, have com­menced fi­nal-phase tri­als in Brazil and the United Arab Emi­rates, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>These are be­ing watched closely, es­pe­cially be­cause of China’s some­what dodgy record with vac­cines – the most re­cent aber­ra­tion hav­ing been in 2018 when 200,000 chil­dren were ad­min­is­tered a de­fec­tive vac­cine for diph­the­ria, tetanus and whoop­ing cough that caused paral­y­sis in some re­cip­i­ents.</p>
    <p>Over­all, there is an al­most Olympian fer­vour around the world – ironic in view of the can­cel­la­tion of the Games – to launch the first vac­cine and there are con­cerns that this fre­netic rush may cause some short cuts to be taken, with po­ten­tially fa­tal con­se­quences. There is also an el­e­ment of nearCold War-era com­pet­i­tive­ness, en­cap­su­lated by the Sput­nik re­mark and un­der­scored by al­le­ga­tions that both China and Rus­sia at­tempted to steal Western coro­n­avirus re­search.</p>
    <p>Three Western vac­cine can­di­dates – one pro­duced by the Amer­i­can firm Moderna and the Na­tional In­sti­tutes for Health; the sec­ond by Ox­ford Univer­sity and Bri­tain’s As­traZeneca and the third by Ger­many’s BioNTech with Amer­i­can com­pany Pfizer – are in fi­nal-phase tri­als.</p>
    <p>Dr Fauci’s re­marks came amid a con­gres­sional hear­ing where he com­mented: “I do not be­lieve that there will be vac­cines so far ahead of us (the United States) that we will have to de­pend on other coun­tries to get us vac­cines.”</p>
    <p>The search for a vac­cine that ought to have brought the world to­gether ap­pears to have fur­ther di­vided it.</p>
