    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s royal palace post­poned from yes­ter­day all meet­ings for two weeks be­cause of new coro­n­avirus curbs, a palace of­fi­cial said, likely put­ting off a de­ci­sion on a bid by op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim to form a new gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war had on Tues­day met the King to try to prove he had a “con­vinc­ing” par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity to form a gov­ern­ment, spark­ing a fresh bout of po­lit­i­cal wran­gling more than seven months af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin took of­fice.</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah was sched­uled to meet lead­ers of main po­lit­i­cal par­ties to ver­ify Mr An­war’s claim, but a two-week par­tial lock­down took ef­fect from yes­ter­day in Kuala Lumpur and the neigh­bour­ing state of Se­lan­gor.</p>
    <p>The King has post­poned all meet­ings due to the con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der im­posed as coro­n­avirus cases spike, palace comptrolle­r Ah­mad Fadil Sham­sud­din told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The palace will set new dates for the meet­ings with party lead­ers af­ter the curbs are lifted, Datuk Ah­mad Fadil said.</p>
    <p>The monarch had ear­lier post­poned au­di­ences with op­po­si­tion lead­ers Lim Guan Eng and Mo­hamad Sabu.</p>
    <p>Lim, who is sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party, and Mr Mo­hamad, pres­i­dent of Parti Amanah Ne­gara, said in a press state­ment that they were ini­tially sched­uled to meet Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah at Is­tana Ne­gara yes­ter­day and on Oct 21, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The palace had also sched­uled an au­di­ence with Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi and Malaysian In­dian Congress chief S.A. Vigneswara­n to­day.</p>
    <p>Should Mr An­war suc­ceed in his bid to be­come prime min­is­ter, it would be the cul­mi­na­tion of a 22-year quest, which in­cluded nearly 10 years in jail on sodomy charges he de­nied.</p>
    <p>It would also mean Malaysia would have its third prime min­is­ter this year.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war told a news con­fer­ence on Tues­day that he had pre­sented doc­u­ments to the King to prove he had the sup­port of more than 120 mem­bers of the 222-seat Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The palace later said Mr An­war had sub­mit­ted the num­ber of law­mak­ers that he said sup­ported him but had not iden­ti­fied them.</p>
    <p>Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah plays a largely cer­e­mo­nial role but he can ap­point a prime min­is­ter who, in his view, is likely to com­mand a ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, at the height of wran­gling that saw the col­lapse of the ad­min­is­tra­tion of vet­eran leader Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, the King ap­pointed Tan Sri Muhyid­din as Prime Min­is­ter af­ter con­sult­ing all the 222 MPs.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din has a two-seat par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity – 113 seats – but crit­ics say he came to power through shift­ing al­liances and not by earn­ing it at the bal­lot box.</p>
    <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day logged 660 new coro­n­avirus cases, the same num­ber of new in­fec­tions re­ported on Tues­day, and just shy of the 691 record daily high last week. The to­tal num­ber of cases stood at 17,540.</p>
    <p>Four more deaths were recorded in the past 24 hours, rais­ing to­tal fa­tal­i­ties to 167.</p>
    <p>Should op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim suc­ceed in his bid to be­come prime min­is­ter, it would be the cul­mi­na­tion of a 22-year quest, which in­cluded nearly 10 years in jail on sodomy charges he de­nied. It would also mean Malaysia would have its third prime min­is­ter this year.</p>
