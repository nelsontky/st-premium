    <p>chair ath­letes tak­ing part.</p>
    <p>Bos­ton was due to take place in April, but was then resched­uled for Septem­ber be­fore even­tu­ally be­ing can­celled al­to­gether in May.</p>
    <p>Both Ber­lin and New York were also axed last month, leav­ing London – which was moved from</p>
    <p>April 26 to Oct 4 – as the last WMM race standing.</p>
    <p>That event, how­ever, is in se­ri­ous doubt, with The Tele­graph re­port­ing that or­gan­is­ers fear “not only will this year’s edi­tion be can­celled al­to­gether, but that it may also be im­pos­si­ble to stage next year’s event in its usual slot”.</p>
    <p>Hugh Brasher, race di­rec­tor of the London Marathon, also told the news­pa­per that he and his team are “ex­plor­ing all op­tions for 2021 with our stake­hold­ers”. An of­fi­cial an­nounce­ment is ex­pected on July 28.</p>
    <p>LONDON • Re­duc­tion in sta­dium ca­pac­i­ties, im­proved ven­ti­la­tion sys­tems and mo­bile pay­ment for tick­ets and drinks are some of the mea­sures foot­ball clubs may have to im­ple­ment while de­sign­ing sta­di­ums in the wake of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A re­cent study con­ducted by ar­chi­tec­ture stu­dio Fen­wick Irib­ar­ren says the de­sign of sta­di­ums in the fu­ture will be in­flu­enced by Covid-19 and clubs will need to em­brace solutions that pro­mote so­cial dis­tanc­ing in venues.</p>
    <p>Mark Fen­wick, one of the two co-founders, has es­ti­mated that clubs would have to re­duce ca­pac­ity sig­nif­i­cantly to en­sure a rea­son­able level of safety.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber the great dis­as­ters in Eng­land (and Bel­gium) changed sta­di­ums with peo­ple standing up to peo­ple sit­ting down and seat­ing ca­pac­ity was re­duced by 30 per cent,” he said, re­fer­ring to the Hills­bor­ough and Hey­sel dis­as­ters in the 1980s.</p>
    <p>“No touch” solutions, in­clud­ing au­to­matic doors, ac­ti­va­tion of lights by in­frared de­tec­tion and mo­bile pay­ment for tick­ets and drinks are al­ready avail­able, but im­ple­ment­ing them would be ex­pen­sive, in­creas­ing the cost of host­ing matches.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Deloitte and KPMG, clubs in Europe’s top-five leagues have suf­fered an es­ti­mated 15 to 30 per cent loss or up to US$718 mil­lion (S$1 bil­lion) in match-day rev­enue this cam­paign due to the rest of the sea­son be­ing held be­hind closed doors.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor North Amer­i­can com­pe­ti­tions like the Na­tional Hockey League, Ma­jor League Soc­cer and the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion have been hit just as hard.</p>
    <p>“It is still un­known whether fans will re­turn to watch live foot­ball in the same crowded mass as be­fore the pan­demic,” Andrea Sar­tori, KPMG’s global head of sports, said. “Ex­pe­ri­ence... shows that once the di­rect and im­me­di­ate threat of a cri­sis is gone, peo­ple tend to re­turn to their rou­tine ac­tiv­i­ties – even more so if it is their pas­sion­ate pas­time.”</p>
    <p>The study also touched upon the need for health-screen­ing pro­ce­dures at sta­di­ums, sug­gest­ing the use of fa­cial recog­ni­tion that links to a health data­base to iden­tify at-risk in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>While strict mea­sures are doable, Mark Wil­liams, who works at ar­chi­tec­tural firm HKS, is con­cerned whether they are fi­nan­cially vi­able for pro teams as two out of three seats could be empty to en­sure safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing an ad­di­tional layer of tem­per­a­ture checks at en­try point will also hurt the bot­tom line. “Does it make sense eco­nom­i­cally to even do that? That’s one big con­cern,” he said.</p>
