    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan aims to ex­pand a ma­jor re­gional free trade pact called the CPTPP, Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga said yes­ter­day, po­ten­tially cater­ing for China’s and Bri­tain’s in­ter­est in join­ing the deal.</p>
    <p>The Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Tran­sPa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP) links 11 coun­tries, in­clud­ing Ja­pan, Canada and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Ja­pan will aspire for the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pa­cific through the early con­clu­sion of the RCEP agree­ment and the steady im­ple­men­ta­tion and ex­pan­sion of the CPTPP as next year’s chair,” Mr Suga said.</p>
    <p>He made the com­ment in a pre-recorded video mes­sage de­liv­ered at the Apec (Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion) CEO Dia­logues, ahead of a lead­ers’ vir­tual sum­mit later in the day.</p>
    <p>RCEP, or the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship, is the world’s largest free trade deal, which was signed this month by 15 economies, while the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pa­cific is po­ten­tially an even larger pact that the 21-mem­ber Apec has been as­pir­ing to.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Chi­nese Com­merce Min­istry said on Thurs­day that his coun­try was open to the idea of join­ing the CPTPP, while Bri­tain ear­lier this year an­nounced its in­tent to pur­sue ac­ces­sion to the pact.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi is sched­uled to travel to Ja­pan next week, mark­ing the first high­level visit be­tween the two coun­tries since the out­break of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Ja­pan’s For­eign Min­is­ter Toshim­itsu Motegi said at a reg­u­lar brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Motegi said he will meet Mr Wang for talks dur­ing the two-day visit that starts on Tues­day and will also likely in­clude a cour­tesy visit on Mr Suga. Mr Wang will fly to Seoul the next day, the Korea Eco­nomic Daily said, and hold talks with South Korean For­eign Min­is­ter Kang Kyung-wha.</p>
