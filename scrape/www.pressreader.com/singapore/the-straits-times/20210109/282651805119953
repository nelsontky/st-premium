    <p>• Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer is con­fi­dent his play­ers can bounce back quickly af­ter their League Cup chal­lenge ended on Wed­nes­day when they lost 2-0 to Manch­ester City in the semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>A tight sched­ule means that the Red Dev­ils have no time to dwell on their de­feat, as they pre­pare to host Cham­pi­onship side Wat­ford in the FA Cup third round to­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at his pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Sol­sk­jaer in­sisted that his men have the men­tal strength and hunger to win.</p>
    <p>He said: “You’re dis­ap­pointed when you go out, al­ways are, but we have shown many times this sea­son we can bounce back af­ter dis­ap­point­ments.</p>
    <p>“We did it af­ter de­feat (by) Arse­nal (1-0), af­ter Tot­ten­ham (6-1), af­ter go­ing out of Cham­pi­ons League, the boys have re­acted well.</p>
    <p>“We go into the next game want­ing to win this, we en­ter this com­pe­ti­tion want­ing to win. There’ll be a few changes but we’ll still field a team I’m con­fi­dent in.”</p>
    <p>Apart from 19-year-old winger Fa­cundo Pel­listri, who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the United boss also said that he has “a full and fit squad” to pick from.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran striker Edin­son Ca­vani, 33, will serve the third and fi­nal match of his sus­pen­sion. Amad Diallo, 18, is also un­avail­able as his visa has yet to be pro­cessed de­spite the Ivo­rian winger’s trans­fer be­ing con­firmed on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>On his new Jan­uary sign­ing, Sol­sk­jaer said: “I’ve seen there’s been lots of ex­pec­ta­tions on Amad and rightly so, an ex­cit­ing player with fan­tas­tic at­tributes.</p>
    <p>“We look for­ward to de­vel­op­ing and giv­ing him the chance to suc­ceed at Man United. It’s im­por­tant we give him time to set­tle in, if it’s in the 23s for his first few games, or if he looks ready to go into the first team, I don’t know yet.”</p>
    <p>United have be­come un­likely</p>
    <p>Premier League ti­tle con­tenders this sea­son – they can re­place Liver­pool in top spot on Tues­day if they avoid de­feat at Burn­ley.</p>
    <p>But Sol­sk­jaer will wants to de­liver a tro­phy as soon as pos­si­ble and the FA Cup could be his best chance, while they are also in the last 32 of the Europa League.</p>
    <p>United, who are 12-time win­ners of the FA Cup, made it to the semis last term but lost 3-1 to Chelsea.</p>
    <p>They are favourites to progress to the fourth round, hav­ing won their last nine home games in all com­pe­ti­tions against Wat­ford.</p>
    <p>They have also won three of their four FA Cup meet­ings with the Hor­nets – the last time they faced off was a 4-1 win in 2007.</p>
    <p>But Wat­ford boss Xisco Munoz, in charge of just his sec­ond match af­ter suc­ceed­ing Vladimir Ivic last month, has urged his men to ig</p>
    <p>nore talk of be­ing the un­der­dogs.</p>
    <p>“The most im­por­tant thing is we go there and fight like an­i­mals,” he said. “I know it will be dif­fi­cult be­cause Manch­ester United is a per­fect team, but we need to give our best and try very hard. We go there with max­i­mum am­bi­tion.”</p>
