    <p>United Over­seas Bank (UOB) has launched a new part­ner­ship ecosys­tem, mak­ing it sim­pler for cus­tomers to make pay­ments on var­i­ous apps and use re­wards points to off­set their util­i­ties bills.</p>
    <p>The bank has part­nered Visa to use a new Visa ap­pli­ca­tion pro­gram­ming in­ter­face (API) that en­ables cus­tomers to add their Visa credit and debit cards se­curely into third­party apps us­ing the UOB Mighty mo­bile bank­ing app, without the need for a phys­i­cal card.</p>
    <p>This means that cus­tomers no longer need to man­u­ally key in their 16-digit card num­ber, ex­piry date and card se­cu­rity code. In ad­di­tion, new cus­tomers will no longer need to wait for their credit or debit cards to be de­liv­ered to them be­fore they can make pur­chases.</p>
    <p>All UOB credit and debit cards will be re­flected on the UOB Mighty app once the card ap­pli­ca­tions have been ap­proved. Cus­tomers sim­ply need to log in to the app and choose the card they wish to add to their pre­ferred third-party app.</p>
    <p>They will then be au­to­mat­i­cally di­rected to the se­lected app to con­firm their choice.</p>
    <p>The en­tire process can be com­pleted within sec­onds on their mo­bile phones, UOB said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>From yes­ter­day, cus­tomers could use this new ser­vice on Fit­bit Pay with their UOB Visa cards. It will also be avail­able on the Fave, Grab and Shopee apps for UOB Visa and Mastercard cards in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>UOB has also part­nered en­ergy util­i­ties com­pany SP Group to al­low cus­tomers to off­set their SP util­i­ties bills, us­ing the bank’s re­wards points, or UNI$. Through a UOB API used by SP, cus­tomers sim­ply need to choose the op­tion of us­ing their UNI$ points when they make pay­ment on SP’s util­i­ties app.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers there­fore no longer need to re­deem a voucher through the bank’s dig­i­tal bank­ing ser­vices or wait seven work­ing days to re­ceive and use the voucher.</p>
    <p>They can also now in­stantly re­deem their re­wards points on Sin­ga­pore Air­lines’ KrisPay app.</p>
    <p>The bank said it will pro­gres­sively ex­pand its net­work of part­ners to bring sim­i­lar dig­i­tal pay­ments and re­wards re­demp­tion solutions to more cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>UOB head of group per­sonal fi­nan­cial ser­vices Jac­que­lyn Tan said: “Whether our cus­tomers are bank­ing on UOB Mighty or mak­ing pay­ments on our part­ners’ apps, our aim is to cre­ate an in­tu­itive ex­pe­ri­ence and to re­move any dis­rup­tions or de­tours to their dig­i­tal jour­ney.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong Yu Hsiang, head (prod­ucts, sales and mar­ket­ing) of SP Dig­i­tal, said the com­pany’s col­lab­o­ra­tion with UOB adds to the suite of fea­tures on its SP Util­i­ties app.</p>
    <p>More than 700,000 house­holds use SP’s app to man­age their util­i­ties bills and to mon­i­tor their elec­tric­ity con­sump­tion.</p>
