    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga will join the race to suc­ceed his boss Shinzo Abe as prime min­is­ter, lo­cal me­dia said yes­ter­day, as the com­pe­ti­tion to take over from Ja­pan’s long­est-serv­ing leader hots up.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, 71, a long-time lieu­tenant of Mr Abe’s in a key sup­port­ing role, had de­nied in­ter­est in the top job, but at­tracted at­ten­tion with a se­ries of in­ter­views with Reuters and other news or­gan­i­sa­tions in the days be­fore Mr Abe’s abrupt res­ig­na­tion for health rea­sons.</p>
    <p>A Suga govern­ment would ex­tend the fis­cal and mon­e­tary stim­u­lus that de­fined 65-year-old Mr Abe’s nearly eight years in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s an­nounce­ment last Friday, cit­ing a wors­en­ing of a chronic ill­ness, set the stage for a lead­er­ship elec­tion within his Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP). The LDP pres­i­dent is vir­tu­ally as­sured of be­ing prime min­is­ter be­cause of the party’s majority in the Lower House of Parliament.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga de­cided to join the LDP race, judg­ing that he should play a lead­ing role, given ex­pec­ta­tions of his abil­ity to man­age crises. These in­clude the Covid-19 pan­demic and Ja­pan’s deep­est post-war eco­nomic dive, Kyodo news agency said, cit­ing an un­named source.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga would join such can­di­dates as former for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida and former de­fence min­is­ter Shigeru Ishiba.</p>
    <p>En­vi­ron­ment Min­is­ter Shin­jiro Koizumi, 39, the son of charis­matic former premier Ju­nichiro Koizumi and con­sid­ered a fu­ture premier, has de­cided not to run, but he would back De­fence Min­is­ter Taro Kono if he joins the race, NHK said.</p>
    <p>Former in­ter­nal af­fairs min­is­ter Seiko Noda and former de­fence min­is­ter To­momi Inada, who is known as a fis­cal hawk, are in­ter­ested in seek­ing to be­come Ja­pan’s first fe­male premier, the me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, a self-made politi­cian in</p>
    <p>Mr Suga de­cided to join the LDP race, judg­ing that he should play a lead­ing role, given ex­pec­ta­tions of his abil­ity to man­age crises. These in­clude the Covid-19 pan­demic and Ja­pan’s deep­est post-war eco­nomic dive, Kyodo news agency said, cit­ing an un­named source.</p>
    <p>a coun­try of po­lit­i­cal dy­nas­ties, was cho­sen by Mr Abe in 2012 for the piv­otal role of chief cabi­net sec­re­tary, act­ing as top govern­ment spokesman, co­or­di­nat­ing poli­cies and rid­ing herd on bu­reau­crats.</p>
    <p>“I’m think­ing of run­ning in the LDP lead­er­ship race. I’d like you to sup­port me,” Mr Suga told LDP sec­re­tary-gen­eral Toshi­hiro Nikai in a se­cret meet­ing last Saturday, TV Tokyo re­ported.</p>
    <p>Mr Nikai’s fac­tion will most likely sup­port Mr Suga if he runs, Mr Takeo Kawa­mura, a se­nior fac­tion of­fi­cial, told re­porters af­ter a meet­ing of the group’s lead­ers.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one wants to be on the win­ning side, so if Nikai is sup­port­ing Suga, they will jump on the band­wagon,” said po­lit­i­cal sci­ence pro­fes­sor Koichi Nakano of Sophia Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>LDP heavy­weights aim to hold a slimmed-down lead­er­ship con­test around Sept 13 to 15, pub­lic broad­caster NHK said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The party is likely to de­cide on the scaled-down ver­sion to­mor­row, Mr Kawa­mura said.</p>
    <p>Usu­ally, a lead­er­ship vote is held by LDP Mem­bers of Parliament along with grass­roots party mem­bers in a month-long process.</p>
    <p>But in the event of a sud­den res­ig­na­tion, an extraordin­ary vote can be called, with par­tic­i­pants nar­rowed down to MPs and rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the LDP lo­cal chap­ters.</p>
    <p>The scaled-down ver­sion may dis­ad­van­tage Mr Ishiba, a long-time Abe critic who pro­motes boost­ing re­gional economies in Ja­pan’s de­pop­u­lat­ing hin­ter­lands.</p>
    <p>He is pop­u­lar with the pub­lic but less so among party MPs.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga ranks low in voter polls of the pre­ferred next premier. He projects the im­age of a be­hind-thescenes op­er­a­tor more than that of a front-line leader, so some an­a­lysts doubt he would be best to lead the LDP into a gen­eral elec­tion that must be held by late Oc­to­ber next year.</p>
    <p>LDP fac­tions will play a dom­i­nant role in the elec­tion, Pro­fes­sor Nakano said.</p>
    <p>There might be me­dia crit­i­cism that this is not a real con­test, which might give Mr Ishiba a bump up, but “not enough to change the mo­men­tum”, he said.</p>
