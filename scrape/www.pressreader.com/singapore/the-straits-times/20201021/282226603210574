    <p>Aus­tralia’s cen­tral bank dis­cussed the pos­si­bil­ity of fur­ther mon­e­tary eas­ing at its Oct 6 board meet­ing, in­clud­ing cut­ting the cash rate to­wards zero and buy­ing longer-dated gov­ern­ment bonds, min­utes of the meet­ing showed.</p>
    <p>Re­serve Bank of Aus­tralia (RBA) board mem­bers noted larger bal­ance sheet ex­pan­sions by other cen­tral banks had led to lower sovereign yields in most other rich na­tions, the min­utes showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The board also dis­cussed im­pli­ca­tions for the ex­change rate, pro­vid­ing the clear­est sign yet the RBA will likely soon cut rates fur­ther and ex­pand its mas­sive bond buy­ing cam­paign, to lower both bor­row­ing costs and the lo­cal dol­lar.</p>
    <p>Yields on Aus­tralia’s 10-year gov­ern­ment bonds were down at 0.75 per cent yes­ter­day, from 0.9 per cent at the start of the month.</p>
    <p>That is in line with US Trea­suries, but still higher than Bri­tain, Ger­many, France, Canada and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>The RBA has held its cash rate at a record low 0.25 per cent since an emer­gency 50 ba­sis points (bps) cut in mid-March. Economists widely pre­dict the RBA will trim the rate at its Nov 3 pol­icy meet­ing by 15 bps to 0.1 per cent.</p>
    <p>The min­utes showed those pre­dic­tions could prove ac­cu­rate, as RBA board mem­bers ex­pressed opin­ions that fur­ther mon­e­tary eas­ing would be ef­fec­tive as the econ­omy opens up from coro­n­avirusled re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Some Aus­tralian states and ter­ri­to­ries have ef­fec­tively elim­i­nated the virus, while oth­ers – such as the most pop­u­lous state of New South Wales – have been suc­cess­ful in curb­ing small out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the min­utes, RBA as­sis­tant gover­nor Chris Kent said one of the mon­e­tary tools for the board was to buy bonds fur­ther out the yield curve.</p>
    <p>“Those pur­chases fur­ther out could oc­cur on a reg­u­lar ba­sis... and the in­ten­tion there is to bring down the longer end of the yield curve that would re­duce fund­ing costs,” Mr Kent said in re­ply to a Reuters query. “It will also prob­a­bly have some ad­di­tional port­fo­lio balanc­ing ef­fects, in­clud­ing on the ex­change rate.”</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian dol­lar slipped to a three-week trough of US$0.7053.</p>
    <p>Apart from fur­ther mon­e­tary eas­ing, the board also dis­cussed the na­ture of its for­ward guid­ance, agree­ing “to place more weight on ac­tual, not fore­cast, inflation in its de­ci­sion-mak­ing”.</p>
    <p>“Mem­bers in­di­cated that they would also like to see more than just progress to­wards full em­ploy­ment be­fore con­sid­er­ing an in­crease in the cash rate, as the board views ad­dress­ing the high rate of un­em­ploy­ment as an im­por­tant na­tional pri­or­ity.”</p>
    <p>The job­less rate is hov­er­ing near 7 per cent now, hav­ing risen from around 5 per cent pre-Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Economists say the ac­tual level of un­em­ploy­ment would be even higher if those on gov­ern­ment sup­port were in­cluded.</p>
