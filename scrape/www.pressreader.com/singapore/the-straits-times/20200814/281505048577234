    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Law So­ci­ety yesterday set out its ar­gu­ments on why se­nior lawyer Lee Suet Fern should be dis­barred over her han­dling of found­ing prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew’s will, say­ing she had been in­volved in its prepa­ra­tion and ex­e­cu­tion de­spite know­ing her hus­band stood to gain from it.</p>
    <p>It also said the lawyer of 37 years had hur­ried her fa­ther-in-law through the process of sign­ing it with­out the ad­vice of his usual lawyer, who had pre­pared his ear­lier wills.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, in Fe­bru­ary this year, a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal had found her guilty of “grossly im­proper con­duct”, and yesterday, the Law So­ci­ety asked a Court of Three Judges to up­hold the find­ing.</p>
    <p>Coun­ter­ing the so­ci­ety’s ar­gu­ments be­fore the court, Se­nior Coun­sel Ken­neth Tan and Pro­fes­sor Wal­ter Woon, a for­mer at­tor­ney-gen­eral, said Mrs Lee was act­ing out of af­fec­tion and con­cern as a daugh­terin-law in as­sist­ing Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and was merely per­form­ing an ad­min­is­tra­tive role.</p>
    <p>They added that there could not have been any con­flict of in­ter­est be­cause Mr Lee Kuan Yew, “a bril­liant lawyer”, was fully aware of what he wanted and had con­sented to Mrs Lee han­dling the will for him. They called for all charges to be dropped.</p>
    <p>The case cen­tred on the last will of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, which dif­fered from his sixth and penul­ti­mate will in sig­nif­i­cant ways, in­clud­ing the dis­tri­bu­tion of his es­tate among his three chil­dren as well as the de­mo­li­tion of his house at 38 Ox­ley Road.</p>
    <p>A Court of Three Judges, the le­gal pro­fes­sion’s highest dis­ci­plinary body, com­pris­ing Chief Jus­tice Sun­daresh Menon, Judge of Ap­peal Ju­dith Prakash and Jus­tice Woo Bih Li, grilled the lawyers on both sides. It will give its judg­ment at a later date.</p>
    <p>‘FAIL­URE’ TO DIS­CHARGE DU­TIES AS A LAWYER</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the al­most six-hour hear­ing held over video-con­fer­enc­ing, the Law So­ci­ety’s lawyer, Ms Koh Swee Yen from WongPart­ner­ship, ar­gued that Mrs Lee had as­sumed the role of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s lawyer, hav­ing re­ceived in­struc­tions from him, acted on them, and also cut out his usual lawyer, Ms Kwa Kim Li, from the process.</p>
    <p>Ar­gu­ing that Mrs Lee had con­tra­vened the Le­gal Pro­fes­sion Act and the Le­gal Pro­fes­sion (Pro­fes­sional Con­duct) Rules, Ms Koh said she had done so de­spite know­ing her hus­band Lee Hsien Yang, the younger son of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and brother of Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, was a ben­e­fi­ciary of the will.</p>
    <p>She sub­mit­ted that as a vet­eran lawyer, Mrs Lee should have known to ask Mr Lee Kuan Yew to seek in­de­pen­dent ad­vice as he had done on all of his pre­vi­ous wills.</p>
    <p>But in­stead, she had sent him what she said was a 2011 draft copy of his first will to sign, which turned out to be dif­fer­ent from the first will he had ac­tu­ally signed. She had also ar­ranged for lawyers from her firm to en­gross it, mak­ing it his fi­nal le­gal will.</p>
    <p>This came after Mr Lee Kuan Yew had ex­pressed his wish to Ms Kwa to re­vert to giv­ing equal shares of his es­tate to his chil­dren, after hav­ing signed six wills over the years. He had sug­gested do­ing it through a cod­i­cil, an ad­di­tion or sup­ple­ment that mod­i­fies the will.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh also said Mrs Lee knew Ms Kwa was not avail­able at that time and took it on her­self to be re­spon­si­ble for the con­tents of the fi­nal will.</p>
    <p>The last will con­tained a de­mo­li­tion clause – re­lat­ing to the de­mo­li­tion of his 38 Ox­ley Road house after his death – which had been drafted for pre­vi­ous ver­sions of the will, but was sub­se­quently deleted in the later ver­sions, in­clud­ing the penul­ti­mate one.</p>
    <p>It also be­queathed an equal share of the es­tate to each of his three chil­dren. In his sixth and penul­ti­mate will, his daugh­ter, Dr Lee Wei Ling, was to have a larger share.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh said Mrs Lee did not ad­vise Mr Lee Kuan Yew on the dif­fer­ences be­tween the draft last will and the penul­ti­mate will.</p>
    <p>COURT URGED TO CON­SIDER ‘LACK OF CRED­I­BIL­ITY’</p>
    <p>Ms Koh added that even if there was no im­plied re­tainer, Mrs Lee’s con­duct was im­proper as it had re­sulted in Mr Lee Kuan Yew not re­ceiv­ing in­de­pen­dent ad­vice on the will that in­volved a “sub­stan­tial gift” to her hus­band.</p>
    <p>CJ Menon chided Ms Koh for spend­ing too much time try­ing to es­tab­lish that Mrs Lee ma­noeu­vred her way into be­com­ing Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s lawyer and de­ceived him into sign­ing the will, point­ing out that it was not rel­e­vant or nec­es­sary to do so to prove there was an im­plied re­tainer be­tween them.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that the will’s va­lid­ity has not been con­tested by the ex­ecu­tors or ben­e­fi­cia­ries, he said: “The only ques­tion be­fore us per­tains to whether (Mrs Lee) was in a so­lic­i­tor­client re­la­tion­ship, and if she was, whether she dis­charged her du­ties, and if she wasn’t, whether there was some other as­pect of her con­duct that was un­ac­cept­able.”</p>
    <p>But Ms Koh urged the court to con­sider the tri­bunal’s find­ings on Mrs Lee’s and her hus­band’s “lack of cred­i­bil­ity”, say­ing their ex­pla­na­tions for their ac­tions “range from the im­prob­a­ble to the patently con­trived to the down­right dis­hon­est”.</p>
    <p>She pointed to how Mrs Lee had not de­nied draft­ing the will orig­i­nally, but later said it was her hus­band who for­warded the will to her. She had not said this in her defence, but had said it later in her af­fi­davit.</p>
    <p>An ag­gra­vat­ing fac­tor is how Mrs Lee and her hus­band were able to pro­duce e-mails from 2013, but could not pro­duce any e-mails to show her hus­band had in­deed for­warded the will to her, said Ms Koh.</p>
    <p>“The find­ing of the dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal is that (Mrs Lee) has sup­pressed ma­te­rial ev­i­dence,” she added.</p>
    <p>DEFENCE SAYS SANC­TIONS NOT WAR­RANTED</p>
    <p>Re­but­ting these ar­gu­ments, Mr Tan con­tended that the Law So­ci­ety had not proven Mrs Lee had acted as Mr Lee’s lawyer and that she did not de­serve to be sanc­tioned.</p>
    <p>He ar­gued that she acted pri­mar­ily as a daugh­ter-in-law rather than a lawyer and pointed out that her email to Mr Lee Kuan Yew, in which she for­warded a copy of the draft will, had been copied to Ms Kwa for en­gross­ment.</p>
    <p>She ar­ranged for lawyers from her own firm, Mor­gan Lewis Stamford, to do the en­gross­ment later when it emerged that Ms Kwa was un­avail­able. Ms Kwa was also sent a copy of the fi­nal will after Mr Lee Kuan Yew had signed it, he said.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore you’re a lawyer, you’re a son or daugh­ter. The rules are not that of this court or any court,” he added. “Love, af­fec­tion and fa­mil­ial re­la­tion­ships have got noth­ing to do with these cold courts and they should not be scru­ti­nised here.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Lee’s role was purely ad­min­is­tra­tive, and Ms Kwa “never ceased to be” Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s lawyer through­out the process.</p>
    <p>Later, when CJ Menon pointed out that the facts showed it was “in­con­tro­vert­ible that (Ms Kwa) had no in­volve­ment in the last will”, Mr Tan said that in ex­e­cut­ing the will, Mr Lee Kuan Yew had no lawyer “and he did not need one”.</p>
    <p>AT WORST, MRS LEE COM­MIT­TED A TECH­NI­CAL BREACH: PROF WOON</p>
    <p>Prof Woon ar­gued that even if Mrs Lee had acted as Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s lawyer, she did not breach her du­ties.</p>
    <p>Say­ing the Law So­ci­ety had “fo­cused on the trees with­out ap­pre­ci­at­ing the for­est”, he said Mr Lee Kuan Yew was lu­cid and in con­trol of his fac­ul­ties and so knew what he wanted and what he was do­ing.</p>
    <p>This was un­like the tri­bunal’s por­trayal of him as a “dod­der­ing old dotard” be­ing taken ad­van­tage of by his son and daugh­ter-in-law, Prof Woon added. He also said there could be no con­flict of in­ter­est if Mr Lee Kuan Yew chose to go ahead with her as his lawyer re­gard­less of their re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged that Mrs Lee may have com­mit­ted a tech­ni­cal breach of the rules in do­ing so, but he ar­gued there was still no mean­ing­ful case for sanc­tions to be im­posed as Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s de­ci­sion to re­vert to the ear­lier will had been made be­fore Mrs Lee’s in­volve­ment. She was also not aware it would in­crease her hus­band’s share of the in­her­i­tance, he added.</p>
    <p>He added that it would have been an in­sult to the se­nior Mr Lee’s in­tel­li­gence for Mrs Lee to de­cline to help and sug­gest he should get in­de­pen­dent ad­vice as it would “im­ply he doesn’t know what he’s do­ing”.</p>
    <p>“He would have ex­ploded. The sound of the ex­plo­sion would have been heard all the way to the Is­tana,” he said, ad­ding that the de­ci­sion had al­ready been ar­rived at and this shows Mr Lee Kuan Yew, a “bril­liant lawyer” him­self, could not have been taken ad­van­tage of.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Woo, how­ever, said the rule on con­flict of in­ter­est was an ab­so­lute rule, and ap­plies whether or not any dam­age oc­curred.</p>
    <p>Prof Woon said he ac­cepted the po­si­tion but asked if sanc­tions would be mean­ing­ful in this case since Mr Lee Kuan Yew had known what he was do­ing.</p>
    <p>He also took is­sue with the tri­bunal’s find­ing that Mr Lee Kuan Yew was mis­led and rushed into sign­ing a will he did not want, de­scrib­ing the tri­bunal’s case as “im­prob­a­ble in the ex­treme”.</p>
    <p>He said the truth was that Mrs Lee had done what she did as Mr Lee Kuan Yew did not want to wait for Ms Kwa, ad­ding: “Any­one who dealt with (Lee Kuan Yew) would un­der­stand this. He was not known to be a pa­tient man. If he wanted to wait for (Ms Kwa), so be it. But he read the will, signed it, ini­tialled on ev­ery page, called for it the fol­low­ing day and reread the will... the in­escapable in­fer­ence is that this is ex­actly what he wanted.”</p>
    <p>He added that the tri­bunal “was wrong to crit­i­cise” Mrs Lee and ac­cuse her and her hus­band of ly­ing as the ev­i­dence did not sup­port this con­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Prakash re­but­ted Prof Woon’s ar­gu­ment that there was no con­flict of in­ter­est and that Mrs Lee did not breach her du­ties be­cause Mr Lee Kuan Yew was aware of the facts and will­ing to ac­cept them.</p>
    <p>She pointed out that the rules on con­flict of in­ter­est are ab­so­lute and Mrs Lee is guilty of a tech­ni­cal breach at the least.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion of whether Mr Lee Kuan Yew was aware of this is rel­e­vant to de­ter­min­ing the sanc­tions Mrs Lee ought to re­ceive, and not whether there was a breach, Jus­tice Prakash said.</p>
