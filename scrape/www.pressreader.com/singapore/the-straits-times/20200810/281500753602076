    <p>The ship­ping busi­ness has been rocked by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic de­spite the fact that mar­itime trade routes were largely kept open to main­tain sup­ply lines.</p>
    <p>For the in­dus­try to sail past the cri­sis, jobs in the ma­rine sec­tor need to re­main se­cure and crew changes need to take place smoothly de­spite closed bor­ders, in­dus­try play­ers said.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of ves­sels ar­riv­ing here in June fell al­most 40 per cent from a year ago, and the sec­tor has sev­eral new is­sues to tackle.</p>
    <p>One con­cern is ship crew re­place­ment when work­ers’ con­tracts ex­pire but crew mem­bers can­not dis­em­bark from the ves­sels due to bor­ders stay­ing shut to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Jas­mine Lam, who is di­rec­tor of the Mar­itime En­ergy and Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence, said that sea­far­ers are some­times given ex­tended crew con­tracts de­spite be­ing over­due to re­turn home.</p>
    <p>“Is­sues of sea­far­ers’ safety and well-be­ing, such as fa­tigue, ex­ist. Th­ese di­rectly af­fect ship­ping safety,” said Prof Lam, who is also di­rec­tor of the univer­sity’s mar­itime stud­ies pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>An es­ti­mated 200,000 sea­far­ers world­wide re­quire im­me­di­ate repa­tri­a­tion, Prof Lam said.</p>
    <p>This global is­sue was high­lighted in a Fi­nan­cial Times ar­ti­cle ear­lier this year, which at­tracted re­sponses from then Trans­port Min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan and former Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and Health Lam Pin Min.</p>
    <p>Lo­cally, the Sin­ga­pore Ship­ping As­so­ci­a­tion (SSA) has spear­headed a work­ing group to fa­cil­i­tate crew change in the Repub­lic.</p>
    <p>The group, which includes the Mar­itime and Port Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA), among oth­ers, de­vel­oped a guide to en­able sign-on crew to start their em­ploy­ment and sign-off crew to re­turn home.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic fa­cil­i­tated an av­er­age of about 300 cases of crew change per day last month, ac­cord­ing to an MPA state­ment on July 24.</p>
    <p>An SSA spokesman said in re­sponse to me­dia queries that the as­so­ci­a­tion “will con­tinue to work with all the au­thor­i­ties and in­dus­try stake­hold­ers to put in place prag­matic pro­cesses for safe and reg­u­lar crew change”.</p>
    <p>But it will re­quire all hands on deck, es­pe­cially af­ter com­pa­nies were found to have breached pro­to­cols of self-iso­la­tion, ac­cord­ing to a re­port on TradeWinds, a global ship­ping news web­site, last month.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said: “We will con­tinue to em­pha­sise to all stake­hold­ers that it is the re­spon­si­bil­ity of all rel­e­vant par­ties to do their due dili­gence for safe and sched­uled crew change to take place.”</p>
    <p>En­sur­ing the jobs of ma­rine work­ers is another con­cern in the cur­rent eco­nomic cli­mate.</p>
    <p>The mar­itime in­dus­try con­trib­utes to about 7 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and em­ploys more than 170,000 work­ers, ac­cord­ing to the Mar­itime Sin­ga­pore web­site.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of ves­sel ar­rivals has fallen 39.8 per cent to 6,701 in June from 11,138 a year ago.</p>
    <p>Con­tainer vol­umes have dropped by 1 per cent in the first six months of this year from a year ago.</p>
    <p>Prof Lam said: “The great­est im­pact is on pas­sen­ger ship­ping, in­clud­ing cruise.”</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­ger ship ar­rivals in Sin­ga­pore have plunged by more than 95 per cent dur­ing April to June when com­pared with the same pe­riod last year, she added.</p>
    <p>The SSA spokesman said: “With the global econ­omy al­most grind­ing to a halt, many com­pa­nies are try­ing to rec­on­cile their busi­ness oper­a­tions and man­power strength.”</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion will be con­duct­ing a study by the end of the year to “bet­ter un­der­stand the cur­rent and fu­ture man­power re­quire­ments from our mem­bers... to jointly de­velop plans to keep or cre­ate jobs for the mar­itime sec­tor”, he added.</p>
    <p>One pos­si­bil­ity is a por­tal to pool and match mar­itime com­pa­nies with prospec­tive em­ploy­ees, the spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Prof Lam said: “As the mar­itime in­dus­try is one of the key sec­tors con­tribut­ing to Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy, fall­ing de­mand and rev­enue ad­versely af­fect Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>“Fi­nan­cial per­for­mance of firms in the mar­itime in­dus­try is in­evitably af­fected. Th­ese firms have to lower costs and many do not have new hires at the mo­ment,” she added.</p>
    <p>MPA rolled out the Mar­itimeSG To­gether Pack­age – amount­ing to about $27 mil­lion – that took ef­fect on May 1. It is meant to pro­vide fi­nan­cial sup­port for com­pa­nies, as well as train­ing and em­ploy­ment sup­port for Sin­ga­porean sea­far­ers.</p>
    <p>It comes on top of re­lief mea­sures an­nounced by the Govern­ment in four sup­ple­men­tary Bud­gets.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Sea­men also worked with MPA to pro­vide the Sea­far­ers Re­lief Pack­age, which pro­vides $800 a month to el­i­gi­ble Sin­ga­porean sea­far­ers.</p>
    <p>PSA In­ter­na­tional chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Chong Meng said dur­ing the DBS Asian In­sights Con­fer­ence last month that one of the early steps that PSA took was to as­sure work­ers that “re­trench­ments (were) not on our minds”.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which op­er­ates in 16 coun­tries, is tak­ing steps to fill gaps be­tween “sea and rail” and “sea and road” that the Covid-19 pan­demic has ex­posed, he added.</p>
    <p>“Lo­gis­tics, as a whole, is like a team sport with many parts – very frag­mented... we have a re­spon­si­bil­ity then to try and con­nect them bet­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>300 Av­er­age num­ber of cases of crew change per day that Sin­ga­pore fa­cil­i­tated in July.</p>
    <p>95% Plunge in pas­sen­ger ship ar­rivals in Sin­ga­pore dur­ing April to June, com­pared with same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ship­ping As­so­ci­a­tion will be con­duct­ing a study by the end of the year to “bet­ter un­der­stand the cur­rent and fu­ture man­power re­quire­ments from our mem­bers... to jointly de­velop plans to keep or cre­ate jobs for the mar­itime sec­tor”, its spokesman said. One pos­si­bil­ity is a por­tal to pool and match mar­itime com­pa­nies with prospec­tive em­ploy­ees.</p>
