    <p>Clean­ing com­pany direc­tor Jimmy Tey is only 23, but he has al­ready in­vested about $200,000 in equities and en­dow­ment plans in an ef­fort to grow his wealth.</p>
    <p>He is among a grow­ing num­ber of those in Gen­er­a­tion Z, aged 18 to 23, who are cash­ing in on bear­ish mar­kets amid eco­nomic un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Banks, robo-ad­vis­ers and in­sur­ance com­pa­nies told The Sun­day Times that more Gen Z youth have started to in­vest this year.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ments by cus­tomers un­der 23 on OCBC Bank’s dig­i­tal plat­forms shot up 200 per cent in the third quar­ter, com­pared with the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>That eas­ily out­did in­vest­ments by other age seg­ments, which grew 50 per cent on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>Th­ese young in­vestors shelled out an av­er­age of $3,500 on OCBC’s RoboIn­vest plat­form, which of­fers var­i­ous port­fo­lio themes, in­clud­ing a “Gen-Z Win­ners” one that cov­ers sec­tors such as gam­ing and on­line re­tail.</p>
    <p>Mr Kelvin Goh, head of wealth ad­vi­sory at OCBC, said: “Gen Zs are more fa­mil­iar with dig­i­tal chan­nels. There has also been a gen­eral rise in in­ter­est in in­vest­ments this year. Cou­pled with the lack of ac­tiv­i­ties one used to do pre-Covid, th­ese fac­tors helped to drive the in­crease.”</p>
    <p>He noted that Gen Z youth are in­vest­ing more in blue chips, which tend to of­fer sta­bil­ity. In­vest­ments by them in OCBC’s Blue Chip In­vest­ment Plan (BCIP) surged 65 per cent from the first to the se­cond quar­ter, with each cus­tomer de­posit­ing an av­er­age of $210.</p>
    <p>“My con­cern when it comes to younger age bands is that there is a de­gree of spec­u­la­tion about in­vest­ments, but the fact that they are in­vest­ing in the BCIP means they are tak­ing a long-term fi­nan­cial view and in­vest­ing within their means,” Mr Goh added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the num­ber of Gen Z in­vestors on DBS Bank’s digiPort­fo­lio – the bank’s hy­brid hu­man-robo in­vest­ment plat­form – grew 200 per cent from March to this month, and rose 20 per cent year on year in the se­cond quar­ter for the DBS/POSB In­vestSaver reg­u­lar sav­ings plan.</p>
    <p>Ms Evy Wee, head of fi­nan­cial plan­ning and per­sonal in­vest­ing at DBS, said: “This can be at­trib­uted to the over­all in­crease in in­vest­ment ap­petite given the mar­ket sell-off due to Covid-re­lated volatil­ity.”</p>
    <p>More peo­ple in their late teens are also in­vest­ing. The num­ber of DBS Young In­vestor ac­counts – aimed at those be­tween 18 and 20 – opened in Septem­ber was around 50 per cent higher than in the same month last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Rachel Ong, deputy chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer and head of dig­i­tal chan­nels and sales at UOB As­set Man­age­ment (UOBAM), said Gen Z in­vestors tend to seek higher cap­i­tal growth as they can ac­cept and ride out short-term volatil­ity.</p>
    <p>Given that many of th­ese in­vestors are still study­ing, they usu­ally start with less than $100 and grad­u­ally in­crease their in­vest­ments over time, with the av­er­age port­fo­lio at around $1,000 on the UOBAM In­vest mo­bile robo-ad­vi­sory app, said Ms Ong.</p>
    <p>“Com­pared with other age groups, (Gen Zs) are less afraid to keep in­vest­ing when the mar­ket falls, al­beit with cau­tion and within their fi­nan­cial means,” she added.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey by fi­nan­cial com­par­i­son plat­form SingSaver found that 31 per cent of Gen Z youth were knowl­edge­able about in­vest­ing, com­pared with 23 per cent of mil­len­ni­als – those aged 24 to 39.</p>
    <p>SingSaver in­terim coun­try man­ager Prashant Ag­gar­wal said hav­ing grown up with the In­ter­net, Gen Z youth have had ac­cess to a plethora of fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion, tips and tools on­line.</p>
    <p>They seem to pre­fer stocks and bonds be­cause th­ese al­low them to build their port­fo­lio with small in­vest­ments, and of­fer reg­u­lar div­i­dends and in­ter­est in­come that tend to be bet­ter than re­turns on most sav­ings ac­counts, he added.</p>
    <p>Non-bank robo-ad­vis­ers have also gained pop­u­lar­ity among young re­tail in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Sin­ga­pore Gen Z in­vestors on dig­i­tal wealth man­age­ment plat­form StashAway rose 260 per cent year on year in the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Many of them do not have a back­ground in fi­nance: Just 14 per cent of StashAway clients aged 18 to 23 have a busi­ness or fi­nance de­gree, while 12 per cent have worked in a fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion, said chief ex­ec­u­tive and co-founder Michele Fer­rario.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Gen Z clients pre­vi­ously made up just 10 per cent to 15 per cent of dig­i­tal wealth man­age­ment plat­form Syfe’s cus­tomer base, but this grew to 20 per cent to 25 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Dhruv Arora said Gen Z in­vestors are usu­ally in­de­pen­dent and do their own re­search, whereas many older re­tail in­vestors tend to gather knowl­edge through word of mouth.</p>
    <p>“The value of $100 is also greater to them, so be­ing cost-ef­fec­tive is also very im­por­tant,” he added.</p>
    <p>Money is not the only thing on young in­vestors’ minds.</p>
    <p>More youth are also buy­ing in­vest­ment-linked in­sur­ance poli­cies (ILPs) to get pro­tected and grow their wealth at the same time.</p>
    <p>In­surer Great Eastern recorded a 250 per cent in­crease in ILPs sold to such in­vestors in the first 10 months of this year over the same pe­riod last year. Most bought reg­u­lar pre­mium plans that in­sure against death, to­tal per­ma­nent dis­abil­ity and terminal ill­ness.</p>
    <p>Un­der­grad­u­ate Mo­hamed Da­nial Mo­hamed Aripin, 22, ap­pre­ci­ates that ILPs of­fer “the best of both worlds”.</p>
    <p>“There are many un­cer­tain­ties that are dif­fi­cult to fore­see and we should be pre­pared for them,” said Mr Mo­hamed Da­nial, who stud­ies me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>AIA Sin­ga­pore has also seen its num­ber of ILP pol­i­cy­hold­ers aged 18 to 23 nearly dou­ble over the past decade.</p>
    <p>Chief cus­tomer and dig­i­tal of­fi­cer Melita Teo said: “Young in­vestors in the Gen Z de­mo­graphic are en­ter­ing their early 20s and are proac­tively seek­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties to get ahead in their fi­nan­cial goals and as­pi­ra­tions.”</p>
    <p>Like­wise, Mr Stan­ley Ng, head of prod­uct at Pru­den­tial Sin­ga­pore, said ILPs can help young peo­ple di­ver­sify their in­vest­ment port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>He said: “They can ad­just their pro­tec­tion cov­er­age as they go through dif­fer­ent life stages. They may also make con­tri­bu­tions, with­drawals and fund switches to take ad­van­tage of mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
