    <p>WASHINGTON • Gover­nor Ralph Northam of Vir­ginia was dis­cussed as a pos­si­ble tar­get by mem­bers of an anti-gov­ern­ment group in the US charged last week with plot­ting to kid­nap the Michigan gover­nor, the FBI has said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a hear­ing in the US District Court in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Spe­cial Agent Richard Trask II of the FBI said Mr Northam and other of­fi­cials were tar­geted be­cause of their ag­gres­sive l ock­down or­ders to re­strict the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Last week, 13 men ac­cused of in­volve­ment i n the al­leged plot against Gover­nor Gretchen Whit­mer of Michigan were charged with a va­ri­ety of state and fed­eral crimes in­clud­ing ter­ror­ism, con­spir­acy and weapons pos­ses­sion. The group’s mem­bers had also talked of plan­ning to storm the Michigan state Capi­tol and start a civil war, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing Tues­day’s hear­ing, the au­thor­i­ties said the sus­pects spoke of “tak­ing” the Vir­ginia gover­nor be­cause of coro­n­avirus lock­down or­ders that re­stricted busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Mr Trask said some of the sus­pects held a meet­ing in Dublin, Ohio, sev­eral months ago where they “dis­cussed pos­si­ble tar­gets” for “tak­ing a sit­ting gover­nor”.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion had alerted mem­bers of Mr Northam’s se­cu­rity team through­out the probe, said Ms Alena Yar­mosky, the gover­nor’s press sec­re­tary, in a state­ment. The gover­nor was not in­formed, “per se­cu­rity pro­to­cols”, she said, but added that “at no time was the gover­nor or his fam­ily in im­mi­nent dan­ger”.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics ear­lier this year lam­basted Ms Whit­mer, a Demo­crat, for her March 24 lock­down, par­tic­u­larly since the stay-at-home or­ders for ru­ral Michigan – which had rel­a­tively few cases of Covid-19 – were the same as those for Detroit and other cities.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tive and anti-gov­ern­ment groups in Michigan were among the first in the United States to or­gan­ise protests against the coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>In Vir­ginia, Mr Northam, also a Demo­crat, is­sued a sim­i­lar or­der on March 30, in­struct­ing res­i­dents to leave their homes only for work, med­i­cal at­ten­tion, fam­ily care, shop­ping for es­sen­tials and “out­door ac­tiv­ity with strict so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments”.</p>
    <p>Mr Northam started reopening much of Vir­ginia on May 15, but as Covid-19 cases rose again over the sum­mer, he im­ple­mented re­stric­tions on bars, restau­rants and public gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump had openly en­cour­aged right-wing protests against so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions in Vir­ginia, Michigan and other states with stay-ath­ome or­ders, right af­ter his ad­min­is­tra­tion had an­nounced guide­lines for gov­er­nors to set their own timeta­bles for reopening their com­mu­ni­ties. Among his tweets were calls to both “Liberate Michigan!” and “Liberate Vir­ginia”.</p>
    <p>Ms Yar­mosky had ref­er­enced Pres­i­dent Trump’s tweets in the state­ment from Mr Northam’s of­fice, and said the “rhetoric com­ing out of this White House has se­ri­ous and po­ten­tially deadly con­se­quences”. She added: “It must stop.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that a 1945 state law Ms Whit­mer had been us­ing to is­sue her emer­gency or­ders was un­con­sti­tu­tional and in­val­i­dated the or­ders. Most of the or­ders had been lifted on June 1, but af­ter the rul­ing, emer­gency or­ders were is­sued through the health depart­ment, which kept in place mask re­quire­ments as well as lim­its on the size of gath­er­ings and busi­ness ca­pac­i­ties.</p>
