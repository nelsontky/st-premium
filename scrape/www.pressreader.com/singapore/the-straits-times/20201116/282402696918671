    <p>With the Covid-19 pandemic show­ing no signs of abat­ing, business net­works in Sin­ga­pore have been fa­cil­i­tat­ing in­for­ma­tion ex­changes through we­bi­nars and es­tab­lish­ing new ini­tia­tives to sup­port mem­ber busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Business lun­cheons that used to be held face to face have been moved on­line to en­sure that mem­bers can con­tinue to en­gage with one an­other.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus out­break has shown the value and im­por­tance of part­ner­ships be­tween busi­nesses, the com­mu­nity and the au­thor­i­ties, cham­ber rep­re­sen­ta­tives said.</p>
    <p>Dr Lei Hsien-Hsien, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Amer­i­can Cham­ber of Com­merce in Sin­ga­pore (AmCham), said: “Col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween busi­nesses and with the Gov­ern­ment will be cru­cial to help re­turn the econ­omy to pre-Covid-19 lev­els of pro­duc­tiv­ity and ac­tiv­ity.”</p>
    <p>AmCham is launch­ing a pro­gramme later this month to sup­port close to 200 of its small and medium-sized en­ter­prise mem­bers, through av­enues such as strate­gic part­ner­ships and train­ing and de­vel­op­ment, to help these firms grow and trans­form their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean-Ger­man Cham­ber of In­dus­try and Com­merce (SGC) has con­ducted eight sur­veys over the past few months to bet­ter un­der­stand the im­pact of Covid-19 on busi­nesses and the econ­omy, and had shared the re­sults with its mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Sur­veys found that the travel re­stric­tions to curb the pandemic have been se­verely dis­rup­tive, lead­ing to lower sales per­for­mance due to com­pany rep­re­sen­ta­tives not meet­ing ex­ist­ing and new clients.</p>
    <p>The cham­ber has helped cre­ate new business col­lab­o­ra­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties. It has or­gan­ised a vir­tual business del­e­ga­tion trip from Ger­many to Sin­ga­pore and vir­tual business match­ing for Ger­man com­pa­nies to find business part­ners in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Bri­tish Cham­ber of Com­merce Sin­ga­pore launched its trade ser­vices por­tal and ser­vices last month for busi­nesses in the United King­dom that are look­ing to ex­pand to Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The cham­ber is look­ing to launch an on­line learn­ing hub soon, which will fo­cus on ed­u­ca­tion and pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment, said its ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor David Kelly.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Cham­ber of Com­merce and In­dus­try has been head­ing col­lab­o­ra­tions be­tween trade as­so­ci­a­tions and busi­nesses to help busi­nesses trans­form and cap­ture new business op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>It has helped its mem­ber com­pa­nies ac­cess mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties in China and coun­tries in South­east Asia.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it is help­ing around 35 Sin­ga­pore brands and 200 prod­ucts branch into the Chi­nese mar­ket through the Sin­ga­pore Im­port Pavil­ion at the Greenland Global Com­mod­ity Trad­ing Hub in Shanghai. The Sin­ga­pore Im­port Pavil­ion was launched on Nov 1 and the prod­ucts on dis­play will be ro­tated ev­ery six months.</p>
    <p>Mr Jens Rueb­bert, pres­i­dent of the SGC, said: “In dif­fi­cult times, busi­nesses must sup­port com­mu­ni­ties be­cause col­lab­o­ra­tions show­case unity be­tween busi­nesses and the com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>The cham­ber’s mem­bers have do­nated close to $250,000 to the Sayang Sayang Fund and the In­vic­tus Fund so far, he added.</p>
