    <p>Af­ter a month of smooth sail­ing, Sin­ga­pore’s cruise to nowhere pi­lot hit its first snag yes­ter­day, ini­tially spark­ing fears of an on­board out­break, but later look­ing like a false alarm.</p>
    <p>Royal Caribbean cruise ship Quan­tum of the Seas was forced to turn back on day three of a four-day voy­age, af­ter an 83-yearold Sin­ga­porean male pas­sen­ger tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus on board the ship, hav­ing ear­lier passed a manda­tory pre­board­ing test.</p>
    <p>The drama on the high seas took a sur­pris­ing turn last night when the Health Min­istry an­nounced that two sub­se­quent tests – one of the pa­tient’s orig­i­nal sam­ple and one fresh sam­ple – came back neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory will con­duct a third test to­day to con­firm the pa­tient’s Covid-19 sta­tus, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, all 1,680 pas­sen­gers and 1,148 crew mem­bers dis­em­barked at the Ma­rina Bay Cruise Cen­tre last night, af­ter be­ing con</p>
    <p>fined to their rooms dur­ing the day while con­tact trac­ing was car­ried out.</p>
    <p>All un­der­went anti­gen rapid tests be­fore be­ing per­mit­ted to exit the ter­mi­nal.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) said yes­ter­day that the in­fected pas­sen­ger had re­ported to the on-board med­i­cal cen­tre with di­ar­rhoea late on Tues­day, and was given a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test which came back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Those iden­ti­fied as hav­ing close con­tact with the pa­tient were iso­lated, and all tested neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent fol­lows the sus­pen­sion of Sin­ga­pore’s first travel bub­ble ar­range­ment with Hong Kong amid a spike in cases there, sig­nalling the rough seas that the Repub­lic will have to nav­i­gate in re­open­ing its bor­ders and re­boot­ing the tourism sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Be­fore re­ports of the two neg­a­tive tests emerged, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing had said re­sum­ing eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties en­tails some risk.</p>
    <p>Nec­es­sary con­tact trac­ing and iso­la­tion pro­to­cols have been put in place to man­age sit­u­a­tions such as these, he added.</p>
    <p>Quan­tum of the Seas pas­sen­gers, who were awo­ken yes­ter­day by an early morn­ing an­nounce­ment by its cap­tain, re­acted calmly and ap­plauded the ship’s safety mea­sures and han­dling of the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Some said they were aware of the risks, but chose to go ahead as it was their only op­tion for a year-end over­seas hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>Last month, STB gave Gent­ing Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean In­ter­na­tional the green light to of­fer cruises to nowhere from Sin­ga­pore un­der a pi­lot scheme that en­tails a re­duced ca­pac­ity of 50 per cent, among other safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Go­ing on a cruise re­mains on hold in much of the world, with safety still the pri­mary con­cern.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s ap­par­ent set­back ap­pears not to have put a halt to Sin­ga­pore’s cruise plans for now.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Cruise Lines’ World Dream de­parted from Ma­rina Bay Cruise Cen­tre around 6pm yes­ter­day, just be­fore those aboard Quan­tum of the Seas dis­em­barked.</p>
    <p>Dream Cruises said in a state­ment that cruises on World Dream will con­tinue to op­er­ate as sched­uled.</p>
    <p>Its Sin­ga­pore sail­ings com­menced last month, while Royal Caribbean launched its own just last week.</p>
    <p>Royal Caribbean said in a state­ment last night that the ship will be deep cleaned and dis­in­fected, and the cruise sched­uled for to­day will be can­celled.</p>
    <p>Royal Caribbean’s spokesman said: “Be­ing able to iden­tify this sin­gle case and act on it im­me­di­ately demon­strates the sys­tem is work­ing as it is de­signed to.”</p>
