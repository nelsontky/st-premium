    <p>WASHINGTON • Mak­ers of the lead­ing coro­n­avirus vac­cine can­di­dates have dis­closed de­tailed in­for­ma­tion about their piv­otal late-stage clin­i­cal tri­als and how they plan to gauge the safety and ef­fec­tive­ness of their shots.</p>
    <p>The moves by first Moderna, and then later by Pfizer and its part­ner BioNTech, fol­low in­creas­ing worry that the ef­fort to de­velop a Covid-19 vac­cine is be­com­ing politi­cised, and that an in­oc­u­la­tion could be rushed to mar­ket be­fore it is proven safe and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Moderna re­leased its plan ahead of an early Thurs­day morn­ing in­vestor meet­ing.</p>
    <p>The Cam­bridge, Mas­sachusetts­based biotech­nol­ogy com­pany de­cided to share its full trial de­sign to cre­ate public con­fi­dence that it is do­ing ev­ery­thing it can to en­sure a vac­cine works and will not cause harm, said chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Stephane Ban­cel.</p>
    <p>The move re­sulted in a snow­ball of in­for­ma­tion that is not of­ten avail­able to the public and broader sci­ence com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Pfizer soon fol­lowed Moderna, pub­lish­ing its trial de­sign in the form of a 137-page doc­u­ment that de­tails un­der what cir­cum­stances the trial could gen­er­ate early ef­fi­cacy re­sults. As­traZeneca l ater shared its own plans on its web­site as well.</p>
    <p>While the broad out­lines of ma­jor drug tri­als are avail­able on a US gov­ern­ment web­site, de­tails of how and when mon­i­tor­ing boards over­see­ing the tri­als plan to ana</p>
    <p>lyse data are of­ten kept con­fi­den­tial by phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the un­prece­dented push to get a vac­cine to mar­ket quickly has in­creased in­ter­est in those de­tails.</p>
    <p>The anal­y­sis of find­ings and what the rules are for stop­ping a trial if there are en­cour­ag­ing early sig­nals could de­ter­mine how quickly a shot re­ceives emer­gency au­tho­ri­sa­tion from US reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>“We have been work­ing nine months to try to stop this virus by get­ting a vac­cine to mar­ket,” Mr Ban­cel said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“We want to make sure the public has trust in vac­cines by be­ing trans­par­ent.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ban­cel said the most likely sce­nario was that Moderna’s vac­cine could gen­er­ate pre­lim­i­nary ef­fi­cacy data in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>It is “tech­ni­cally pos­si­ble” for Moderna to get re­sults next month, but this is un­likely, Mr Ban­cel said.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Moderna plan, a data mon­i­tor­ing board will take a pre­lim­i­nary look at the ef­fi­cacy re­sults af­ter 53 par­tic­i­pants have con­tracted the coro­n­avirus, and again af­ter 106 cases are reached. The fi­nal anal­y­sis will oc­cur af­ter 151 cases, ac­cord­ing to slides from the in­vestor meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Moderna’s plan is more con­ser­va­tive than the 32-case bench­mark be­ing used by Pfizer for its first pre­lim­i­nary anal­y­sis of the Covid-19 vac­cine it is de­vel­op­ing with Ger­many’s BioNTech.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tional ef­fi­cacy analy­ses will take place when the com­pa­nies iden­tify 62 and 92 cases. Pfizer has said that con­clu­sive ef­fi­cacy re­sults are likely by the end of next month.</p>
    <p>Dr Eric Topol, the editor-inchief of Med­scape and a pro­fes­sor of molec­u­lar medicine at The Scripps Re­search In­sti­tute, wrote in an e-mail that “ag­gres­sive” would be “too kind” a way to de­scribe the trial de­sign, which “has the op­tics of want­ing (en­gi­neer­ing) the trial to stop early, which is not good”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ban­cel said “it is ex­tremely un­likely” ev­ery­one in the coun­try could get vac­ci­nated by the end of the first quar­ter of next year, as a Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial sug­gested on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>There will likely only be enough vac­cines ap­proved for ev­ery Amer­i­can who wants a shot by the sec­ond half of next year, ac­cord­ing to Mr Ban­cel.</p>
    <p>The un­prece­dented push to get a vac­cine to mar­ket quickly has in­creased in­ter­est in those de­tails. The anal­y­sis of find­ings and what the rules are for stop­ping a trial if there are en­cour­ag­ing early sig­nals could de­ter­mine how quickly a shot re­ceives emer­gency au­tho­ri­sa­tion from US reg­u­la­tors.</p>
