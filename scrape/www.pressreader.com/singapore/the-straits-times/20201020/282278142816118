    <p>LOS ANGELES • Seat­tle Storm’s Sue Bird be­lieves women’s foot­ball play­ers in the United States are more widely supported and favoured than their coun­ter­parts in the Women’s Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (WNBA) be­cause of the pub­lic per­cep­tion of them as “cute lit­tle white girls”.</p>
    <p>Point guard Bird, who won her fourth WNBA ti­tle this month, said in an interview with CNN that elite bas­ket­ball play­ers were more quickly judged by people based on their ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>“Even though we’re fe­male ath­letes play­ing at a high level, our worlds... the foot­ball world and the bas­ket­ball world are just to­tally dif­fer­ent,” she said.</p>
    <p>“To be blunt, it’s the de­mo­graphic of who’s play­ing. Women’s foot­ball play­ers gen­er­ally are cute lit­tle white girls while WNBA play­ers, we’re all shapes and sizes... a lot of black, gay, tall women... there’s maybe an in­tim­i­da­tion fac­tor and people are quick to judge it and put it down.”</p>
    <p>Bird’s com­ments re­flect those of Megan Rapi­noe, the co-cap­tain of the US women’s na­tional foot­ball team, who are the de­fend­ing world cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent col­umn in the Play­ers’ Tri­bune, the mid­fielder felt that the US me­dia tended to “scan tall and black and queer” play­ers.</p>
    <p>The main prob­lem, ac­cord­ing to Bird, is not how the WNBA is mar­keted.</p>
    <p>“It’s how so­ci­ety and how the out­side world is will­ing to ac­cept the cute girl next door, but not will­ing to ac­cept, or em­brace, or not judge these bas­ket­ball play­ers who are tall, black, gay,” she added.</p>
    <p>“That... is where the is­sue is. Where I feel like I’ve learnt through­out that process is you have to be who you are. You have to be true to who you are and au­then­tic.”</p>
    <p>The 24th sea­son of the WNBA con­cluded early this month, but it re­mains a money-los­ing project de­spite sub­stan­tial sub­si­dies from the NBA.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber 2018, NBA com­mis­sioner Adam Sil­ver told re­porters that the women’s league loses “over US$10 mil­lion (S$13.6 mil­lion)” ev­ery year it has been in op­er­a­tion.</p>
