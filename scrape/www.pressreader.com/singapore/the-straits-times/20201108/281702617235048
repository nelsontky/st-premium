    <p>Alarm bells are ring­ing over Ja­pan’s fer­til­ity cri­sis as it is ex­pected to be fur­ther ex­ac­er­bated by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry es­ti­mates that there will likely be 845,000 new­borns this year, 20,000 fewer than last year which was also the fifth straight year of de­cline.</p>
    <p>The fer­til­ity rate last year was 1.36, well un­der the of­fi­cial tar­get of 1.8 by fis­cal year 2025 – which is al­ready be­low the re­place­ment rate, or the rate re­quired to main­tain the pop­u­la­tion at a con­stant level, of 2.1.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has warned that if cur­rent trends per­sist, there will likely be fewer than 800,000 ba­bies born next year.</p>
    <p>It was only as re­cently as 2015 when Ja­pan reg­is­tered more than a mil­lion new births, but num­bers have been in free fall since.</p>
    <p>The fore­casts are drawn from “preg­nancy re­ports”, an ad­min­is­tra­tive pro­ce­dure in which ex­pec­tant moth­ers in­form their lo­cal mu­nic­i­pal­i­ties of their preg­nancy, typ­i­cally in their first trimester.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of re­ported preg­nan­cies na­tion­wide fell 11.4 per cent be­tween May and July from the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>And the to­tal num­ber of preg­nancy fil­ings for the first seven months of the year de­clined by 5.1 per cent year on year to 513,850.</p>
    <p>“I think the spread of the coro­n­avirus has many peo­ple wor­ried about get­ting preg­nant, giv­ing birth and rais­ing ba­bies,” Mr Tet­sushi Sakamoto, min­is­ter in charge of re­sponses to Ja­pan’s de­clin­ing birth rates, said last month.</p>
    <p>These in­clude fi­nan­cial pres­sures from job un­cer­tainty that might cause peo­ple to re­think get­ting mar­ried and hav­ing chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The over­all job­less rate for Septem­ber was a three-year high of 3 per cent, driven up by un­em­ployed youth of child-bear­ing age. Those aged 25 to 34 have the high­est job­less rate among all age groups, at 4.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic in­sta­bil­ity, as well as Covid-19 so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines, have also led to de­layed mar­riages, with the num­ber be­tween May and July fall­ing 36.9 per cent from the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>This will likely ac­cel­er­ate the cri­sis, given that a vast ma­jor­ity of ba­bies in Ja­pan are born in wed­lock.</p>
    <p>As more peo­ple delay mar­riage and give birth later, Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s gov­ern­ment is push­ing for leg­is­la­tion to al­low fer­til­ity treat­ments, of­ten cost­ing mil­lions of yen, to be cov­ered by na­tional health in­surance.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga also wants to dou­ble the one-time gov­ern­ment al­lowance given to new­ly­weds to 600,000 yen (S$7,800).</p>
    <p>Among those who got mar­ried re­cently were salary­man Yusuke Hatakeyama, 27, and phys­io­ther­a­pist Mizuki Akutsu, 28, from Ut</p>
    <p>FI­NAN­CIAL HELP FOR YOUTH sunomiya in Tochigi pre­fec­ture.</p>
    <p>They had can­celled their wed­ding in July. Ms Akutsu told the Asahi Shim­bun: “It did not feel right go­ing through a happy oc­ca­sion when so many of my col­leagues were work­ing hard and so many peo­ple were suf­fer­ing.”</p>
    <p>But they de­cided to go ahead with the cer­e­mony on Oct 3 with the bless­ings of her pa­tients, as well as the help of a lo­cally run wed­ding sub­sidy scheme.</p>
    <p>Dr Emi Kataoka, a so­ci­ol­o­gist at Ko­mazawa Univer­sity in Tokyo, told The Sun­day Times that the ex­pected de­cline in child­birth had far out­paced her ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“Young peo­ple are be­com­ing fi­nan­cially poorer, and this will make it even more dif­fi­cult for them to get mar­ried and have many chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“This trend is only ac­cel­er­ated by the coro­n­avirus cri­sis,” she said.</p>
    <p>“There must be poli­cies be­yond child-rear­ing sup­port to fi­nan­cially help youth, who would other­wise see no means and no ben­e­fit to get­ting mar­ried.”</p>
