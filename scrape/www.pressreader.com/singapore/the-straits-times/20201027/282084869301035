    <p>There are sev­eral lessons we must learn from what hap­pened in South Korea over the state-ad­min­is­tered free flu vac­cine pro­gramme and the re­ports of deaths pos­si­bly linked to the jabs.</p>
    <p>First, it is im­por­tant to pre­vent any dis­eases that can be erad­i­cated by vac­cines, such as in­fluenza. This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant to pre­vent two con­cur­rent epi­demics when the world is bat­tling the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, it is im­por­tant to be trans­par­ent when in­ves­ti­gat­ing these deaths. Should there be any safety con­cerns, a tem­po­rary halt to the pro­gramme should be or­dered im­me­di­ately. On the con­trary, if there are no safety con­cerns, it is im­por­tant to push on to save as many lives as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Third, there is a need for proper con­sul­ta­tion with a physi­cian be­fore re­ceiv­ing any vac­cine. This is so that any con­cerns about side ef­fects can be ad­dressed, or the physi­cian can as­sess the suit­abil­ity of a pa­tient be­fore ad­min­is­ter­ing any vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­ceiv­ing a vac­cine, the re­cip­i­ent should be mon­i­tored for any se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tion, such as ana­phy­laxis, be­fore be­ing al­lowed to leave the health­care fa­cil­ity. There should not be any short-cuts in im­ple­ment­ing a vac­cine pro­gramme. Con­cerns about cost and bu­reau­cracy must not be al­lowed to com­pro­mise the safety and ef­fec­tive­ness of a vac­cine pro­gramme. Vac­ci­na­tion dur­ing com­mu­nity events should be dis­al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Fourth, physi­cians should also con­duct com­pre­hen­sive con­sul­ta­tion and phys­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tion, pay­ing at­ten­tion to pa­tients’ past re­ac­tions to any vac­cine. This will re­duce the chance of ad­verse re­ac­tion and fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Fifth, vac­cines are largely safe for the ma­jor­ity of the pop­u­la­tion. How­ever, there are some who are not suit­able to re­ceive live vac­cines. This in­cludes those who are im­muno-com­pro­mised from long-term use of im­muno­sup­pres­sive drugs and those who have just re­ceived chemo­ther­apy.</p>
    <p>Hence, the pub­lic should have their med­i­cal his­tory ready and on hand be­fore vis­it­ing physi­cians.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, much of the ben­e­fit of a na­tion­wide vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme is de­rived from main­tain­ing a herd im­mu­nity in the pop­u­la­tion. Hence, those who are well and have no con­traindi­ca­tions against the vac­cine should come for­ward to be vac­ci­nated. The herd im­mu­nity cre­ated over years will pro­tect the vul­ner­a­ble among us.</p>
    <p>It is crit­i­cal that we im­ple­ment a ro­bust sys­tem here to pro­tect our pop­u­la­tion. This is es­pe­cially so as vac­ci­nat­ing against Covid-19 is go­ing to be one of the pil­lars of fight­ing the on­go­ing pan­demic. Leong Choon Kit (Dr)</p>
