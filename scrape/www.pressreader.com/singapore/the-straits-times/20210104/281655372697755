    <p>On Satur­day, the Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore ho­tel was al­lowed to re­open.</p>
    <p>It had been closed for 14 days af­ter a clus­ter of Covid-19 cases from 10 coun­tries was dis­cov­ered on-site.</p>
    <p>The out­break at the ho­tel led to 394 guests and 571 staff be­ing swabbed for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have cau­tioned that the clus­ter is a re­minder of how eas­ily the virus can spread, a timely warning even as crowds of peo­ple gath­ered over the long New Year week­end.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times looks back on this lat­est clus­ter here.</p>
    <p>On Dec 19 last year, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) an­nounced that it was prob­ing 13 cases of Covid-19 among peo­ple who had served their stay-home no­tice at Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory, which con­ducts whole genome se­quenc­ing and phy­lo­ge­netic anal­y­sis on all Covid-19 cases, found that the 13 im­ported cases – who were con­firmed to be in­fected in early Novem­ber – were in­fected by coro­n­avirus strains that have high ge­netic sim­i­lar­ity.</p>
    <p>This was de­spite the guests fly­ing in from dif­fer­ent coun­tries, im­ply­ing that the in­fec­tions may have come from one source.</p>
    <p>All 13 guests had served their stay-home no­tice in the same tower of the ho­tel be­tween Oct 22 and Nov 11 last year.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel stopped ac­cept­ing new guests with im­me­di­ate ef­fect on Dec 19, and those serv­ing stay­home no­tice there were moved to an­other fa­cil­ity, with guests be­ing checked out pro­gres­sively.</p>
    <p>No staff tested PCR-pos­i­tive, though 11 had pos­i­tive serol­ogy test re­sults. But sev­eral other guests had pos­i­tive PCR re­sults.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, MOH said it had con­cluded its in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the ini­tial 13 cases and found there was no trans­mis­sion be­yond them, and that other Covid-19 cases who served the stay-home no­tice at the ho­tel were not linked to those 13.</p>
    <p>“In view (of the fact) that the premises have been thor­oughly dis­in­fected, and there is no longer risk of trans­mis­sion to ho­tel guests, MOH has ap­proved the reopening of Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>But it is still not known how the peo­ple got in­fected. Ex­perts whom The Straits Times spoke to pre­vi­ously said the hu­man fac­tor was most likely to blame for the spread if it had taken place within the ho­tel, al­though they could not be sure how it oc­curred.</p>
    <p>Thus far, the au­thor­i­ties have not an­nounced the dis­cov­ery of any lapses or breaches in pro­to­cols at the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the in­ci­dent on Dec 22, Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion Lawrence Wong, co-chair of the task force tack­ling Covid-19 here, said: “What hap­pened in Man­darin Or­chard is yet an­other re­minder that things can go wrong.”</p>
    <p>He added: “And that’s why, once again, all of us need to take this se­ri­ously and re­mind our­selves why we should stay vig­i­lant, stay alert and keep our guard up.”</p>
