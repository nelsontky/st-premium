    <p>TEGUCIGALP­A • The rem­nants of Hur­ri­cane Eta have un­leashed tor­ren­tial rain and cat­a­strophic flood­ing on Cen­tral Amer­ica, with fa­tal­i­ties sharply up mostly be­cause of mud­slides as streets turned into rivers and bridges came tum­bling down.</p>
    <p>More than 70 peo­ple were re­ported killed across the re­gion of mostly poor coun­tries wedged be­tween Mex­ico and Colom­bia, and at least hun­dreds were stranded on rooftops or cut off by floods.</p>
    <p>In Gu­atemala, the death toll shot up past 50 over the course of Thurs­day, ac­cord­ing to Pres­i­dent Ale­jan­dro Gi­ammat­tei, who said mud­slides around a cou­ple of small towns swal­lowed about two dozen homes.</p>
    <p>“Right now, we’re try­ing to get there on foot be­cause there’s no other way,” said Mr Gi­ammat­tei, re­fer­ring to flooded out roads that com­pli­cated res­cue ef­forts.</p>
    <p>One of the fiercest storms to hit Cen­tral Amer­ica i n years, Eta struck Nicaragua as a Cat­e­gory 4 hur­ri­cane on Tues­day, with winds of 241 kmh be­fore weak­en­ing to a trop­i­cal de­pres­sion as it moved in­land and into neigh­bour­ing Hon­duras.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies waded through flooded streets of the north­ern Hon­duran city of San Pe­dro Sula, while cars sat al­most sub­merged in parts of the cen­tral Gu­atemalan city of San Pe­dro Car­cha, TV footage and im­ages on so­cial me­dia showed.</p>
    <p>Over­all, eight fa­tal­i­ties were con­firmed in Hon­duras, as more than 5,000 peo­ple were holed up in shel­ters, while 63 com­mu­ni­ties were cut off from com­mu­ni­ca­tions, ac­cord­ing to the gov­ern­ment. Of­fi­cials said 20 bridges there had been de­stroyed.</p>
    <p>A video posted on so­cial me­dia showed one of the bridges, span­ning the Ulua River just east of San Pe­dro Sula, dis­ap­pear­ing into the wa­ter­way af­ter a rag­ing tor­rent pulled it down.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment said about 500 peo­ple were res­cued from their roofs in Hon­duras on Thurs­day as wa­ter lev­els con­tin­ued to rise, but many oth­ers were likely still stranded.</p>
    <p>“We will not leave the area un­til we res­cue the last per­son,” Hon­duran Pres­i­dent Juan Or­lando Her­nan­dez told the me­dia, adding that res­cue ef­forts led by po­lice, sol­diers and fire­fight­ers will con­tinue overnight.</p>
    <p>Dam­age and de­struc­tion had spread across most of Hon­duras and speed­boats and he­li­copters would be sent to take peo­ple to safety in in­ac­ces­si­ble ar­eas, he said ear­lier in the day.</p>
    <p>Me­dia in Nicaragua also re­ported two min­ers had been killed in a mud­slide.</p>
    <p>Mr Gi­ammat­tei had al­ready de­clared a state of emer­gency in nearly half of Gu­atemala’s 22 de­part­ments.</p>
    <p>In south­ern Costa Rica, a land­slide killed two peo­ple in a house, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, five peo­ple, in­clud­ing three chil­dren, died in flood­ing in Panama’s Chiriqui prov­ince, near the Costa Rica bor­der, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>There was at least one silver lin­ing in Hon­duras, where 60 fish­er­men who dis­ap­peared at sea on Tues­day re­turned af­ter tak­ing shel­ter on cays un­til they were res­cued, said com­mu­nity leader Robin Mo­rales.</p>
    <p>Call­ing their sur­vival a “mir­a­cle,” Mr Mo­rales said a man among them pre­sumed dead from a heart at­tack also made it back.</p>
    <p>“Our friends are alive, thank God,” he said.</p>
    <p>Across swathes of Nicaragua, Hon­duras, Gu­atemala and Costa Rica, high winds and heavy rain have dam­aged hun­dreds, if not thou­sands, of homes, forc­ing thou­sands to take cover in shel­ters.</p>
    <p>Eta was mov­ing north-west over Hon­duras and Belize and headed to­wards the Caribbean on Thurs­day, the United States Na­tional Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre (NHC) said. Heavy rain con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>It is fore­cast to re­turn to sea and re­gain mo­men­tum as a trop­i­cal storm, pos­si­bly reach­ing the Cay­man Is­lands, Cuba and south­ern Florida in the com­ing days, the NHC said.</p>
