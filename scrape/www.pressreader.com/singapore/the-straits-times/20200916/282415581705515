    <p>Ja­pan’s Kei Nishikori says he is gain­ing in confidence after scor­ing his first win in over a year on Mon­day on the come­back trail from el­bow surgery, but needs more matches ahead of the French Open start­ing in less than two weeks.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese was the first man from Asia to reach a Grand Slam fi­nal when he made it to the 2014 US Open ti­tle clash. It was also on the hard courts of Flush­ing Mead­ows that the 30-year-old last won a match when he reached the third round last year.</p>
    <p>“I was very pleased to be on the court to­day, first win on the (ATP) Tour,” he told re­porters after de­feat­ing Spain’s Al­bert Ramos-Vi­no­las 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) in the open­ing round of the Ital­ian Open in Rome.</p>
    <p>“I’m still not feel­ing 100 per cent tennis-wise but I en­joyed (my­self). Now it’s im­por­tant to have as many matches as I can, keep win­ning. I need to start get­ting into a good tempo, good rhythm.”</p>
    <p>Nishikori had surgery on his right el­bow after the US Open last year. He was slated to re­turn last month in New York, but pulled out of the Slam after testing pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus de­spite a later neg­a­tive test.</p>
    <p>He played at Kitzbuhel in Aus­tria last week, but the for­mer world No. 4 lost his open­ing match on clay.</p>
    <p>“To­day was much bet­ter than last week, maybe twice bet­ter,” he said, build­ing his confidence ahead of the French Open, with the main draw start­ing on Sept 27.</p>
    <p>“I think at some mo­ments, I don’t have confidence... but lit­tle by lit­tle, I’m get­ting bet­ter. If I can have more matches be­fore French Open, it will be good.”</p>
    <p>He needed six match points to se­cure his open­ing win and could next play three-time Ma­jor win­ner Stan Wawrinka of Switzer­land, who faced Ital­ian qual­i­fier Lorenzo Musetti yes­ter­day. The result of that match was not avail­able at press time.</p>
    <p>For­mer Rome semi-fi­nal­ists Grigor Dim­itrov and Marin Cilic also eased into the sec­ond round.</p>
    <p>Bul­gar­ian Dim­itrov saw off Ital­ian wild card Gian­luca Mager 7-5, 6-1, while Croa­tia’s Cilic beat Kazakh Alexan­der Bub­lik 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-4.</p>
    <p>World No. 1 No­vak Djokovic, a four-time Rome win­ner, and de­fend­ing cham­pion and sec­ond-ranked Rafael Nadal have first-round byes and be­gin their cam­paigns to­day.</p>
