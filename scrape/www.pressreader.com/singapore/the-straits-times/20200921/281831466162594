    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dia’s Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day passed new Bills that the gov­ern­ment says will make it eas­ier for farm­ers to sell their pro­duce di­rectly to big buy­ers, de­spite grow­ing protest from op­po­si­tion par­ties and a long-time ally of the rul­ing party.</p>
    <p>In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi has said the new laws will re­form an­ti­quated laws and re­move mid­dle­men from agri­cul­ture trade, al­low­ing farm­ers to sell to in­sti­tu­tional buy­ers and large re­tail­ers like Wal­mart.</p>
    <p>The Bills also make con­tract farm­ing eas­ier by pro­vid­ing a new set of rules.</p>
    <p>But Food Pro­cess­ing Min­is­ter Har­sim­rat Kaur Badal, who is from an al­liance party, re­signed last Thurs­day in protest, call­ing the Bills “anti-farmer”.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion par­ties have also said that the farm­ers’ bar­gain­ing power will be di­min­ished by al­low­ing re­tail­ers to have tighter con­trol over them.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, some op­po­si­tion law­mak­ers raised slo­gans, tore doc­u­ments and tried to grab t he Speaker’s mi­cro­phone in the Up­per House of In­dia’s Par­lia­ment, be­fore two of the con­tro­ver­sial Bills were passed by a voice vote.</p>
    <p>One of Mr Modi’s se­nior Cabi­net min­is­ters, Mr Ra­j­nath Singh, said on Twit­ter: “The pas­sage of both the Bills in Par­lia­ment is in­deed a land­mark day for In­dian agri­cul­ture.”</p>
    <p>Ms Kaur Badal is from a re­gional party which has a strong base in the north­ern state of Pun­jab and be­lieves the Bills will in­crease farmer suf­fer­ing in the bread bas­ket state.</p>
    <p>Her party be­lieves the laws will de­stroy whole­sale mar­kets which en­sure fair and timely pay­ments to farm­ers, un­der­mine the state’s farm­ers in ne­go­ti­a­tions and weaken the over­all state econ­omy.</p>
    <p>In re­cent days, many farmer or­gan­i­sa­tions have held street protests in Pun­jab and neigh­bour­ing Haryana state near New Delhi.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, In­dia’s main op­po­si­tion Congress party crit­i­cised the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Party spokesman Ran­deep Sur­je­w­ala said: “We will make sure that the gov­ern­ment will have to step down on its knees be­fore the farm­ing community of this coun­try.</p>
    <p>“It will be farm­ers on one side and big busi­nesses on the other side. How will they fight?”</p>
