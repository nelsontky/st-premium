    <p>FIND­ING THAT LOV­ING FEEL­ING</p>
    <p>BELO HORIZONTE (Brazil) • De­spite the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and her re­cent bat­tle with can­cer, Ms Fa­tima Sanson was de­ter­mined to keep up her Christ­mas tra­di­tion of dress­ing up as Mrs Claus and giv­ing out toys and hugs to im­pov­er­ished kids.</p>
    <p>So the 61-year-old made her­self a plas­tic “hug cur­tain”, found an as­sis­tant to dis­in­fect it be­tween em­braces, dressed up in her bright red suit and set up her an­nual toy and food give­away in a poor neigh­bour­hood in Belo Horizonte, in south­east­ern Brazil.</p>
    <p>“It felt so good to be able to give hugs again dur­ing the pan­demic,” said Ms Sanson, who has spent nearly five decades do­ing char­i­ta­ble work in im­pov­er­ished areas.</p>
    <p>She was all too aware of the risk in­volved this year.</p>
    <p>Not only does her age put her in the high-risk group for Covid-19, but the pan­demic be­gan just as she was com­ing off a fight with breast can­cer.</p>
    <p>Brazil has the sec­ond-high­est Covid-19 death toll world­wide, after the United States, with more than 178,000 peo­ple killed.</p>
    <p>But nei­ther the virus nor the pro­tec­tive layer of plas­tic got in the way as Ms Sanson spread her Christ­mas cheer to her young fans.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally liked get­ting a nice, warm hug from Mrs Claus,” said one of the chil­dren, Daphne Victo</p>
    <p>ria, after her em­brace.</p>
    <p>Par­ents, for their part, took home bas­kets full of food – es­pe­cially wel­come this year, given that low-in­come work­ers have been hit hard by the eco­nomic fall­out of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I hope bet­ter days are com­ing and that next year we’ll be able to give real hugs, be able to feel that hu­man warmth that ev­ery­one’s been miss­ing,” said one mother at the char­i­ta­ble event, house cleaner Valmira Pereira.</p>
    <p>Ms Sanson was happy to be able to give hugs at all.</p>
    <p>“It’s so good to hug and be hugged. We’re ‘in­fect­ing’ each other with our hugs, our af­fec­tion, our love,” she said.</p>
