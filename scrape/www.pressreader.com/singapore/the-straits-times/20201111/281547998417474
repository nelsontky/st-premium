    <p>Thou­sands of sup­port­ers gath­ered at a Jakarta air­port yes­ter­day to wel­come back Rizieq Shi­hab, a fire­brand cleric and Is­lamist leader, who went into ex­ile in Saudi Ara­bia af­ter fac­ing charges over send­ing porno­graphic mes­sages and in­sult­ing state ide­ol­ogy. There were chaotic scenes at the air­port as his sup­port­ers paral­ysed the toll road.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>JAKARTA Thou­sands of sup­port­ers gath­ered at Jakarta’s air­port yes­ter­day to wel­come back Rizieq Shi­hab, a fire­brand cleric and Is­lamist leader, who went into ex­ile in Saudi Ara­bia af­ter fac­ing charges over send­ing porno­graphic mes­sages and in­sult­ing state ide­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>There were chaotic scenes as his sup­port­ers, dressed i n white, paral­ysed the air­port’s toll road, scram­bling to get a glimpse of the cleric and try­ing to kiss his hand, Reuters re­ported. Some air­lines were forced to resched­ule flights.</p>
    <p>“We re­ally miss him be­cause we know he re­ally fights for Is­lam and the In­done­sian na­tion,” said Mr Ab­dul Sobur, 42. “I hope Mus­lims can unite.”</p>
    <p>Rizieq, who was jailed in 2008 on charges of in­cit­ing vi­o­lence and who is head of the hard­line Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front (FPI), be­came a fig­ure­head for con­ser­va­tive Is­lam and a po­lit­i­cally in­flu­en­tial move­ment that helped bring down Jakarta’s for­mer Chris­tian gover­nor Ba­suki Tja­haja Pur­nama, pop­u­larly known as “Ahok”, who in 2017 was jailed for in­sult­ing Is­lam.</p>
    <p>That year, po­lice filed a case against Rizieq over in­sult­ing In­done­sia’s sec­u­lar state ide­ol­ogy,</p>
    <p>Pan­casila, and breach­ing pornog­ra­phy laws, af­ter a pur­ported steamy ex­change with a sup­porter that in­cluded naked im­ages of a woman was cir­cu­lated on­line.</p>
    <p>The cleric left In­done­sia in 2017 and po­lice dropped both cases a year later, but he re­mained in self­ex­ile in Saudi Ara­bia un­til yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>An­other sup­porter, Ms Ima Sari Kar­tika, 39, told Reuters she was ju­bi­lant the cleric had re­turned home to the world’s largest Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity na­tion.</p>
    <p>“I have been wait­ing for his pres­ence among In­done­sian Mus­lims for a long time be­cause In­done­sia is the largest Is­lamic coun­try, so there should be an imam who leads the peo­ple here,” she said.</p>
    <p>The racy claims sur­round­ing Rizieq re­volve around What­sApp chats, pur­port­edly be­tween him­self and a fe­male po­lit­i­cal op­er­a­tive that hogged the head­lines in In­done­sia in 2017 un­til he left the coun­try. The What­sApp ex­changes in­cluded sev­eral naked pic­tures of the woman, which were sent to Rizieq as they were “sex­ting”.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions that arose be­tween Rizieq and Mr Ba­suki, a close as­so­ci­ate of In­done­sian Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo, will be closely watched in com­ing months</p>
    <p>Mr Ba­suki lost in the 2017 gu­ber­na­to­rial elec­tion af­ter his op­po­nent played the re­li­gion card, trig­ger­ing mas­sive street ral­lies in­volv­ing tens of thou­sands of Mus­lims protest­ing against the gover­nor. Some of these protests were led by Rizieq.</p>
    <p>Mr Ba­suki was in May 2017 con­victed of blas­phemy against Is­lam. He was sen­tenced to a twoyear jail term and re­leased in Jan­uary last year, af­ter get­ting re­mis­sion. Rizieq was one of the pros­e­cu­tion wit­nesses dur­ing the blas­phemy trial.</p>
    <p>Mr Ba­suki was in Novem­ber last year ap­pointed pres­i­dent com­mis­sioner of In­done­sia’s state oil and gas com­pany Per­tam­ina.</p>
    <p>FIGHTS FOR IS­LAM</p>
    <p>We re­ally miss him be­cause we know he re­ally fights for Is­lam and the In­done­sian na­tion... I hope Mus­lims can unite.</p>
    <p>MR AB­DUL SOBUR, a sup­porter of fire­brand cleric Rizieq Shi­hab.</p>
