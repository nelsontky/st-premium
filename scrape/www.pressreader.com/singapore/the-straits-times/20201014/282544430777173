    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Mo­bile games are thriv­ing as play­ers turn to them for fun and friend­ship dur­ing the pan­demic, with in­creas­ing num­bers of women joining the trend.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing stuck at home has not stopped peo­ple from play­ing games on their phones,” said Sen­sorTower mo­bile in­sights strate­gist Craig Chap­ple. “To the con­trary, mo­bile gam­ing is more pop­u­lar than ever.”</p>
    <p>Smart­phone game play in­volves taps on touch­screens with just a few mo­ments of play at a time, of­ten while sip­ping cof­fee or wait­ing for tran­sit, in con­trast to the con­sole games with im­mer­sive worlds that can span hours.</p>
    <p>Mo­bile games ap­peal to a broader de­mo­graphic than do shoot­ers and other gen­res pop­u­lar on con­sole or PC gamers.</p>
    <p>More than 40 per cent of mo­bile gamers are women, ac­cord­ing to re­search firms New­zoo and Statista. That dif­fers from gamers us­ing con­soles or per­sonal com­put­ers, who are more likely to be males age 12 to 35 years old, ac­cord­ing to an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>“We’ve had loads of peo­ple forced in­side dur­ing lock-downs in need of en­ter­tain­ment,” said Fu­ture­source mo­bile tech and gam­ing re­search an­a­lyst Mor­ris Gar­rard.</p>
    <p>“Gam­ing be­ing one of the most in­ter­ac­tive and en­gag­ing forms of en­ter­tain­ment has seen a sig­nif­i­cant boost.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the mo­bile con­sul­tancy App An­nie, spend­ing on mo­bile gam­ing is ex­pected to see strong growth this year and top US$100 bil­lion (S$136 bil­lion). Pop­u­lar ti­tles in­clude Candy Crush Saga, Hon­our Of Kings, Poke­mon Go and Gar­den­scapes.</p>
    <p>Many mo­bile games are free to down­load and rely on mas­sive num­bers of peo­ple spend­ing a lit­tle on things like ex­tra lives, vir­tual out­fits or items that boost in-game abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>And pay­ing a dol­lar or so to up­grade to an ad-free ver­sion of a mo­bile game is seen by some as a bar­gain.</p>
    <p>Mo­bile play­ers who spend lit­tle to noth­ing are re­ferred to in the in­dus­try as “min­nows”, while those more will­ing to pay are “dol­phins” or “whales” de­pend­ing on how deep they reach into their wal­lets.</p>
    <p>Ca­sual games that rely on short play times such as puz­zle and ar­cade-style games are among the most down­loaded mo­bile ti­tles.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor in­no­va­tion in re­cent years has been a “bat­tle pass” sys­tem pop­u­larised by Fort­nite from Epic Games, with play­ers pay­ing for tick­ets to each “sea­son”, ac­cord­ing to Mr Chap­ple.</p>
    <p>Mo­bile game mak­ers, like their con­sole-fo­cused peers, ma­nip­u­late psy­cho­log­i­cal levers that emo­tion­ally re­ward play­ers and keep them en­gaged in ways that some say can be ad­dic­tive.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has clas­si­fied “gam­ing dis­or­der” a dis­ease char­ac­terised by “im­paired con­trol over gam­ing, in­creas­ing pri­or­ity given to gam­ing over other ac­tiv­i­ties” even if it is detri­men­tal to one’s life.</p>
    <p>But in a stress­ful world, mo­bile games can be a re­lax­ing escape while stand­ing in queues, wait­ing for food or­ders or just whiling away time, ac­cord­ing to play­ers.</p>
    <p>Play­ing mo­bile games can im­prove moods, boost brain power and pro­vide a sense of com­mu­nity, ac­cord­ing to pro­po­nents.</p>
    <p>“Al­lo­cat­ing a bit of time to play­ing games can im­prove your men­tal health in a lot of amaz­ing ways,” Life­hack dig­i­tal mar­keter Zuhair Sharif said in a blog.</p>
    <p>“This has led many to in­cor­po­rate video games into their reg­u­lar lives.”</p>
    <p>World­wide, an es­ti­mated 72 per cent of ac­tive mo­bile game play­ers are “mil­len­ni­als” rang­ing in age from 23 to 38 years old.</p>
    <p>The broader au­di­ence for mo­bile games in­cludes those in parts of the world where smart­phones are the pri­mary, if not only, way peo­ple con­nect to the In­ter­net. “In emerg­ing re­gions, par­tic­u­larly China and In­dia, it is ab­so­lutely huge,” Mr Gar­rard said.</p>
    <p>Mo­bile game rev­enue is pow­ered by the fact that they are eas­ily avail­able to the more than four bil­lion peo­ple in the world with smart­phones, ac­cord­ing to Mr Gar­rard.</p>
    <p>“Maybe they’re not spend­ing a lot, but there are many who spend a lit­tle bit on mo­bile games and it re­ally adds up,” he said.</p>
    <p>A trend to­wards cloud stream­ing ser­vices will likely boost mo­bile gam­ing, as ti­tles once lim­ited to con­soles will be able to of­fer more play on smart­phones or tablets since ac­tion is pow­ered by data cen­tres.</p>
    <p>High-ca­pac­ity, su­per-fast 5G tele­com net­works could en­able game mak­ers to bring con­sole-qual­ity graph­ics and ac­tion to mo­bile de­vices, ap­peal­ing to more hard­core play­ers.</p>
    <p>“The con­cept of gam­ing on the go will be ever more pre­sent, sup­ported by im­prove­ments in mo­bile in­fra­struc­ture,” Mr Gar­rard said.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just the gam­ing plat­form that will be ben­e­fit­ing, but also the likes of Google and Ap­ple.”</p>
