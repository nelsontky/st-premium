    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the national com­mu­ni­ca­tion and biennial up­date re­port Sin­ga­pore sub­mit­ted to the United Na­tions Frame­work Con­ven­tion on Cli­mate Change in 2018, about 14 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal emis­sions came from the trans­port sec­tor.</p>
    <p>I com­mend the Land</p>
    <p>Trans­port Au­thor­ity’s (LTA) move to re­duce that num­ber even fur­ther by de­ploy­ing the first 10 fully elec­tric dou­ble-decker buses in Sin­ga­pore (First 10 elec­tric dou­ble-decker buses hit the roads in S’pore, Oct 28).</p>
    <p>They join 15 elec­tric sin­gle-decker buses that have al­ready been de­ployed as well as the 50 hy­brid buses on the roads, and em­pha­sise LTA’s goal to have buses run on cleaner en­ergy by 2040.</p>
    <p>Even though fos­sil fu­els are burnt to gen­er­ate the elec­tric­ity needed to power th­ese buses, there still is a re­duc­tion in car­bon emis­sions as com­pared with their diesel coun­ter­parts. The move to use elec­tric­ity in­stead of diesel is a step in the right di­rec­tion to­wards com­bat­ing cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are a few points that I would like clar­i­fied about this scheme.</p>
    <p>First, the new buses cost up to twice that of con­ven­tional diesel buses. What are the plans to re­coup this money?</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, th­ese elec­tric buses can carry 10 per cent fewer pas­sen­gers than diesel buses. Would bus fre­quency be ad­justed to off­set this, es­pe­cially dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>Over­all, given that the elec­tric buses have the po­ten­tial to tap cleaner re­new­able en­ergy in the fu­ture, this gives elec­tric buses the po­ten­tial to fur­ther de­velop and be­come more green.</p>
