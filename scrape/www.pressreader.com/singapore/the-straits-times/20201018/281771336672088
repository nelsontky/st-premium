    <p>PARIS • Mil­lions of Euro­peans faced tough new Covid-19 re­stric­tions yes­ter­day as gov­ern­ments try to com­bat spi­ralling in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Paris and other French cities are un­der a night­time cur­few that will last for at least a month, while Eng­land is ban­ning mixed house­hold gath­er­ings in the cap­i­tal and other ar­eas. Italy, mean­while, is con­tem­plat­ing im­pos­ing the tight­est rules on non-es­sen­tial ac­tiv­i­ties since its na­tional lock­down half a year ago.</p>
    <p>In France, about 20 mil­lion peo­ple i n Paris and sev­eral other French cities were fac­ing the start of a 9pm-6am cur­few af­ter the coun­try on Thurs­day saw a new high of 30,000 cases in 24 hours.</p>
    <p>The move – which will last at least a month – has broad pub­lic sup­port, but of­fi­cials are fret­ting over the heavy so­cial and eco­nomic costs it will bring.</p>
    <p>“It’s ter­ri­ble. It feels to me like be­ing back in March,” said Mr Hocine Saal, head of the emer­gency ser­vice at the hos­pi­tal in the Paris sub­urb of Mon­treuil, adding that ris­ing num­bers of non-coro­n­avirus pa­tients made cop­ing “re­ally dif­fi­cult”.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, which has Europe’s high­est death toll at more than 43,000, re­stric­tions are be­ing ramped up with bans on in­door meet­ings be­tween mem­bers of dif­fer­ent house­holds in Lon­don and sev­eral other English cities.</p>
    <p>Those zones are in the sec­ond of a three-tier alert sys­tem, while some ar­eas – no­tably in the north-west – have been placed on the high­est level. About 28 mil­lion peo­ple – half of Eng­land’s pop­u­la­tion – are now sub­ject to tight so­cial re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son has ac­knowl­edged that lo­cal re­stric­tion poli­cies de­signed to spare bat­tered economies from a new full-scale l ock­down can­not be “pain free”.</p>
    <p>In Italy, the govern­ment is mulling over the tight­est curbs on non-es­sen­tial ac­tiv­i­ties since its na­tional lock­down, to con­tain soar­ing new in­fec­tions that topped 10,000 for the first time on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Ital­ian Health Min­is­ter Roberto Sper­anza met re­gional lead­ers yes­ter­day morn­ing to dis­cuss the mea­sures that are ex­pected to be ap­proved by Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte’s govern­ment soon, ac­cord­ing to govern­ment of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Mr Sper­anza said busi­nesses that come un­der the ban will re­ceive some com­pen­sa­tion. Mr Conte’s plan, like Bri­tain’s, is also aimed at avoid­ing a new lock­down and re­duc­ing its eco­nomic im­pact.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment may also or­der bars and restau­rants to close at 10pm, ban­ning some sport­ing ac­tiv­i­ties and chang­ing hours for high schools to pre­vent con­ges­tion. The Lom­bardy re­gion had al­ready ap­proved new re­stric­tions on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Over in Ger­many, Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel urged ci­ti­zens to stay at home when­ever pos­si­ble af­ter 7,830 cases emerged over 24 hours.</p>
    <p>“Say no to the trip which isn’t re­ally nec­es­sary, to a cel­e­bra­tion that isn’t re­ally nec­es­sary. Please stay at home as much as pos­si­ble,” Dr Merkel said in her weekly pod­cast ad­dress. “What will de­ter­mine win­ter and our Christ­mas will be de­cided in the weeks ahead” by how peo­ple re­act now, she added.</p>
    <p>Else­where in Europe, Poland, the Czech Repub­lic and Bel­gium all an­nounced daily record caseloads.</p>
    <p>Aus­tria’s For­eign Min­is­ter Alexander Schal­len­berg and Bel­gium’s For­eign Min­is­ter So­phie Wilmes be­came the two lat­est politi­cians to test pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Con­tam­i­na­tion prob­a­bly oc­curred within my fam­ily cir­cle given the pre­cau­tions taken out­side my home,” Ms Wilmes tweeted.</p>
    <p>Both Mr Schal­len­berg and Ms Wilmes had on Oct 12 at­tended face-to-face talks with Euro­pean Union coun­ter­parts at the For­eign Af­fairs Coun­cil in Lux­em­bourg.</p>
