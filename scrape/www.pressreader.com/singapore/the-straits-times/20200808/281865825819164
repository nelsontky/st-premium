    <p>• Pro-democ­racy ac­tivist Joshua Wong filed a court chal­lenge in Hong Kong yes­ter­day against his dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion from district polls, a move which may have im­pli­ca­tions for this year’s re­movals of op­po­si­tion can­di­dates for the city’s leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>Wong, 23, was the only can­di­date in district coun­cil elec­tions last year to have been dis­qual­i­fied, with the au­thor­i­ties say­ing his can­di­dacy con­tra­vened elec­toral laws that bar “ad­vo­cat­ing or pro­mot­ing self-de­ter­mi­na­tion”.</p>
    <p>Wong, whom China calls a “black hand” of for­eign forces, said at the time that he sup­ported the idea of a non-bind­ing ref­er­en­dum for peo­ple to have a say over Hong Kong’s fu­ture sta­tus within China. But he is against in­de­pen­dence which is anath­ema for Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“The rea­son I ap­ply for ju­di­cial re­view is to make clear that the power of the re­turn­ing of­fi­cer keeps en­larg­ing, they are just (pur­su­ing a) po­lit­i­cal mis­sion,” said Wong, re­fer­ring to of­fi­cials who vet can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Wong, who led protests as a teenager in 2012 and 2014, was also among 12 op­po­si­tion can­di­dates re­cently dis­qual­i­fied from run­ning in elec­tions for seats in the city’s leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>Those polls have been post­poned by a year to Septem­ber next year, with the gov­ern­ment cit­ing coro­n­avirus risks.</p>
    <p>Grounds for dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion in­cluded per­ceived sub­ver­sive in­ten­tions, “op­po­si­tion in prin­ci­ple” to a new na­tional se­cu­rity law im­posed by Bei­jing, and in­ten­tions to form a ma­jor­ity that could block gov­ern­ment leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>If Wong’s court chal­lenge yes­ter­day were ac­cepted, it could pave the way for le­gal chal­lenges to the lat­est round of dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to post­pone the elec­tions has been crit­i­cised by the West as an at­tempt to weaken the pro-democ­racy op­po­si­tion in the Chi­nese-ruled, semi-au­ton­o­mous city. But Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties said the only con­sid­er­a­tion was pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>Pro-democ­racy can­di­dates won more than 80 per cent of the district coun­cil seats in Novem­ber last year and hoped to win an un­prece­dented ma­jor­ity in the leg­is­la­ture, rid­ing on mo­men­tum built on the protests l ast year and fu­elled by re­sent­ment over the new se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Wong faces mul­ti­ple charges for tak­ing part in un­law­ful as­sem­blies re­lated to protests last year and on June 4 this year at a vigil com­mem­o­rat­ing China’s 1989 crackdown on pro-democ­racy pro­test­ers in and around Tianan­men Square.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing im­posed the new se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion on June 30 in re­sponse to last year’s protests.</p>
    <p>Those con­victed un­der the new law face a max­i­mum penalty of life im­pris­on­ment.</p>
