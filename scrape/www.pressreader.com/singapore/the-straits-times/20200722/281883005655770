    <p>With Bri­tain out of the Euro­pean Union, de­ci­sion-mak­ing within the bloc was sup­posed to be much eas­ier.</p>
    <p>Lon­don, which had fre­quently ap­plied the brakes when it came to a deeper in­te­gra­tion of the union, can­not in­ter­vene any­more. Hence, the way seemed to be paved for a Franco-Ger­man al­liance to push ahead with re­forms more rad­i­cal and faster.</p>
    <p>Yet, this as­sump­tion was proven wrong at the re­cent sum­mit in Brus­sels which, more than once on the brink of disaster, saw old con­vic­tions shat­tered and new coali­tions rise.</p>
    <p>In­stead of two days, the sum­mit took four days and four nights of in­tense ne­go­ti­a­tions among the 27 mem­ber states to agree on a re­cov­ery pack­age of a to­tal of €1.82 tril­lion (S$2.9 tril­lion).</p>
    <p>Some €750 bil­lion will go di­rectly to coun­tries hard­est hit by Covid-19 and to stim­u­late the Euro­pean econ­omy as a whole.</p>
    <p>A lit­tle over €1 tril­lion is part of the new EU bud­get plan for the next seven years.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters later, Euro­pean Coun­cil pres­i­dent Charles Michel called it a “good deal”, stat­ing that “Europe is solid”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the big­gest re­cov­ery pack­age in the his­tory of the EU still has to be ap­proved by the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The deal came with a price tag though. The vibe be­tween the ne­go­ti­at­ing par­ties over the past days was of­ten tense, at times even hos­tile.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron was so an­noyed by the talks that he was bang­ing his fist on the ta­ble, Ital­ian Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte felt “black­mailed”, and Hun­gar­ian Prime Min­is­ter Vik­tor Or­ban ac­cused his Dutch coun­ter­part Mark Rutte of openly “hat­ing” him.</p>
    <p>“I am more pes­simistic about the at­mos­phere that will re­main af­ter that,” Mr Eric Mau­rice, head of the Robert Schu­man Foun­da­tion in Brus­sels, told the news chan­nel Euronews while sum­ming up the marathon sum­mit.</p>
    <p>“We see that with ev­ery new cri­sis, it is very dif­fi­cult to be on the same wave­length.”</p>
    <p>In an act of sol­i­dar­ity with its coro­n­avirus-stricken south­ern mem­bers, the EU was sup­posed to swiftly agree to a gi­gan­tic aid pack­age to get those coun­tries back on their feet.</p>
    <p>Also, the richer mem­bers, such as Ger­many and France, wanted to make up for their slow and rather ego­is­tic be­hav­iour at the beginning of the pan­demic in March.</p>
    <p>Italy, Spain and oth­ers were left in the cold for months and had to deal with the fall­out of the virus mainly by them­selves.</p>
    <p>Borders were closed, the ex­port of goods banned, anti-virus mea­sures un­co­or­di­nated.</p>
    <p>Crit­i­cism mounted, with ques­tions raised over what the EU is worth if each mem­ber acts self­ishly in times of need.</p>
    <p>Re­al­is­ing the dan­gers for the EU if such a nar­ra­tive takes root, Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel joined forces with Mr Macron in May and pro­posed an aid pack­age of €500 bil­lion ear­marked as non-re­payable grants.</p>
    <p>For Ger­many, a country seen as rather fis­cally con­ser­va­tive, this was noth­ing less than a rad­i­cal de­par­ture from its pre­vi­ous po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Many of the smaller north­ern coun­tries – such as the Nether­lands, Den­mark, Swe­den, Fin­land and also Aus­tria – felt be­trayed by the sud­den Ger­man about-face.</p>
    <p>Also con­sid­ered con­ser­va­tive fis­cally and lately even la­belled fru­gal, they re­sisted the change and did not want to au­to­mat­i­cally fall in line be­hind Berlin and Paris.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing the EU into a money trans­fer union where the richer coun­tries even­tu­ally have to stand in for the debt of the poorer coun­tries was not what they see as the pur­pose of the EU.</p>
    <p>In fact, Ger­many has also for years been push­ing back against sim­i­lar ini­tia­tives, like the in­tro­duc­tion of eu­robonds. Es­tab­lish­ing a sys­tem of joint li­a­bil­i­ties was a no-go for Berlin.</p>
    <p>In the end, the re­sis­tance of the “fru­gal” states paid off, at least partly. As a com­pro­mise, only €390 bil­lion will now be tagged non-re­payable, while €360 bil­lion will be loans only.</p>
    <p>An­other on­go­ing conflict also al­most de­railed the ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of EU mem­bers de­manded that the dis­burse­ment of EU money be linked to re­spect­ing the prin­ci­ples of the rule of law in the re­cip­i­ent coun­tries.</p>
    <p>This drew the ire of mem­bers such as Poland and Hun­gary – which have con­tin­u­ously been ac­cused of un­der­min­ing the in­de­pen­dence of courts and judges. With their veto power, they had threat­ened to tor­pedo the whole aid pack­age.</p>
    <p>Strip­ping coun­tries of funds is also a com­pli­cated process, re­quir­ing the back­ing of a qual­i­fied ma­jor­ity of gov­ern­ments, that is, 55 per cent of states rep­re­sent­ing at least 65 per cent of the EU pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>It now seems that Dr Merkel and Mr Macron have mis­judged the mood within the EU.</p>
    <p>While in the past, Bri­tain was the one raising red flags if it thought re­forms went too far and too fast, it is now this group of smaller coun­tries that has as­sumed this role.</p>
    <p>Al­though not col­lec­tively an eco­nomic heavy­weight like</p>
    <p>Bri­tain, they have been given de­facto veto power due to the need for unan­i­mous de­ci­sions to be made in key EU ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The re­sis­tance shown at the Brus­sels sum­mit is a clear sig­nal that Paris and Berlin can­not just do what­ever they want.</p>
