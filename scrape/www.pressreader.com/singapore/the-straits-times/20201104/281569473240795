    <p>Mil­lions of Amer­i­cans voted yes­ter­day after a tu­mul­tuous election sea­son marked by a bit­ter cam­paign be­tween US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den. The coun­try ap­pears to be head­ing for a record-high voter turnout, a tes­ta­ment to how fired up the elec­torate is amid a pan­demic and after a sum­mer of protests.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump thanked his sup­port­ers, and his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den made a fi­nal ap­peal for Amer­i­cans to vote as polls opened across the United States yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Election day marked the fi­nale of a tu­mul­tuous election sea­son that saw a surge in early vot­ing, le­gal chal­lenges over bal­lot count­ing and, in­creas­ingly, fears of vi­o­lence in the af­ter­math of the polls.</p>
    <p>The coun­try ap­peared headed for a record-high voter turnout, tes­ta­ment to how fired up the elec­torate is amid a surg­ing pan­demic and after a sum­mer of racial j us­tice protests.</p>
    <p>Al­most 100 mil­lion vot­ers had al­ready cast their votes be­fore election day by mail or in per­son through early vot­ing, more than 70 per cent of the to­tal in 2016.</p>
    <p>That election had set the cur­rent record of 139 mil­lion peo­ple vot­ing. Some 240 mil­lion Amer­i­cans are el­i­gi­ble to vote this year, out of a pop­u­la­tion of about 330 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In a tweet yes­ter­day, Mr Trump thanked his sup­port­ers and said he would never let them down.</p>
    <p>“Your hopes are my hopes, your dreams are my dreams, and your fu­ture is what I am fight­ing for ev­ery sin­gle day!” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, mean­while, ral­lied his sup­port­ers to go out and vote.</p>
    <p>“In 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in me to help lead this coun­try along­side Barack Obama. To­day, I’m ask­ing for your trust once again – this time, in Ka­mala and me,” he tweeted, re­fer­ring to his run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris.</p>
    <p>“We can heal the soul of this na­tion – I prom­ise we won’t let you down,” he added.</p>
    <p>Both can­di­dates spent the eve of the election mak­ing a fi­nal push in key swing states – mostly Mid­west­ern ones which Mr Trump won by ra­zor-thin mar­gins in 2016 – that could push ei­ther of them over the thresh­old of 270 elec­toral votes needed to win the White House.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump did a whirl­wind five ral­lies in the four bat­tle­ground states of North Carolina, Penn­syl­va­nia, Michi­gan and Wis­con­sin, telling sup­port­ers that he would win and warning of vi­o­lence from the los­ing side.</p>
    <p>“Bi­den’s far-left sup­port­ers are threat­en­ing to loot and rob to­mor­row if they don’t get their way,” he said, adding they would be harshly pros­e­cuted.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den held three events in Penn­syl­va­nia and one in Ohio, slam­ming Mr Trump’s di­vi­sive pres­i­dency and promis­ing to get the Covid-19 out­break un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica recorded its sec­ond­high­est sin­gle-day to­tal of more than 91,300 new cases on Mon­day, as the virus surged in the same Mid­west­ern states that Mr Trump needs to win. “We are go­ing to beat this virus. We are go­ing to get it un­der con­trol. And the first step to beat­ing this virus is to beat Don­ald Trump,” said Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Though Mr Bi­den is favoured to win, things are still very much up in the air. The lat­est opin­ion polls con­tinue to have Mr Bi­den ahead of Mr Trump na­tion­ally, but his lead has nar­rowed slightly, with the race tight­en­ing in some key bat­tle­ground states.</p>
    <p>As at Mon­day, Mr Bi­den had a 6½- to eight-point ad­van­tage over Mr Trump na­tion­wide, a mar­gin of around one point down from seven days ear­lier, ac­cord­ing to RealClearP­ol­i­tics and FiveThir­tyEight. Both men are tied in Ari­zona and North Carolina, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters-Ip­sos poll that also showed Mr Bi­den edg­ing ahead in Florida.</p>
    <p>A Quin­nip­iac poll also showed a nar­row Bi­den lead in Florida as well as Ohio, while a Mon­mouth Univer­sity poll found Mr Bi­den’s edge in Penn­syl­va­nia had nar­rowed.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump told sup­port­ers in North Carolina: “We’re go­ing to win Florida. If we win Penn­syl­va­nia, we win the whole thing.”</p>
    <p>Both par­ties are also bat­tling over which bal­lots should be counted. On Mon­day, a fed­eral judge ruled against a Republican push to re­ject 127,000 bal­lots cast in driv­ethrough tents over the past few days in Har­ris County, Texas, a Demo­cratic-lean­ing county in an oth­er­wise red-lean­ing state.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, Mr Trump crit­i­cised an ear­lier Supreme Court de­ci­sion al­low­ing mail-in bal­lots in Penn­syl­va­nia and North Carolina to be re­ceived and counted after election day, as long as they were post­marked by election day.</p>
    <p>“It will al­low ram­pant and unchecked cheat­ing and will un­der­mine our en­tire sys­tems of laws.</p>
    <p>“It will also in­duce vi­o­lence in the streets. Some­thing must be done!” said Mr Trump in a tweet that was marked as mis­lead­ing by Twitter.</p>
    <p>But the prospect of un­rest has the na­tion on edge. Stores were boarded up with ply­wood in cities from Wash­ing­ton to Man­hat­tan.</p>
    <p>States, in­clud­ing Massachuse­tts and Ore­gon, put their Na­tional Guard on standby in case post-election protests turn vi­o­lent.</p>
    <p>Whether a win­ner will be called on election night may de­pend on how close the con­test is, although can­di­dates may de­clare vic­tory be­fore it be­comes a cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has urged that votes re­ceived after yes­ter­day not be counted, and Ax­ios re­ported on Sun­day that Mr Trump may de­clare vic­tory on Tues­day night if it looks like he is ahead.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den cam­paign said in a briefing on Mon­day that “un­der no sce­nario” would Mr Trump be de­clared vic­tor on election night, ar­gu­ing that Mr Bi­den had more path­ways to the pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>“There is no his­tor­i­cal prece­dent that any of our elec­tions have ever run and been counted and com­pletely ver­i­fied on election night. We do not ex­pect that to hap­pen in 2020,”said Mr Bi­den’s cam­paign man­ager Jen­nifer O’Mal­ley Dil­lon.</p>
