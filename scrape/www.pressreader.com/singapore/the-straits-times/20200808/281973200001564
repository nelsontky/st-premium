    <p>The an­nounce­ment by then Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion Ong Ye</p>
    <p>Kung last month that more in-depth con­ver­sa­tions re­gard­ing race and re­li­gion will be en­cour­aged in schools is wel­come. It recog­nises the grow­ing in­ter­est among the young to talk about these sen­si­tive sub­jects as well as dif­fi­cult is­sues that in­clude those of class and gen­der. This is due to their de­sire to be so­cially con­scious and so­cially en­gaged.</p>
    <p>Such in­ter­est is also a man­i­fes­ta­tion of the way the the­ory of in­ter­sec­tion­al­ity is gain­ing ac­cep­tance among the young to­day. In­ter­sec­tion­al­ity at its core is based on the be­lief that in­di­vid­u­als and groups may be dis­ad­van­taged and dis­crim­i­nated against by mul­ti­ple sources of iden­ti­ties that com­prise race, class, gen­der, sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion, re­li­gion and other iden­tity mark­ers. So when one speaks of racial dis­crim­i­na­tion, an in­ter­sec­tional per­spec­tive helps one un­der­stand that the ex­pe­ri­ence of, say, a fe­male from a mi­nor­ity eth­nic com­mu­nity who is also dis­abled, is dif­fer­ent from that of a man from the same com­mu­nity who does not have phys­i­cal dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>In­ter­sec­tion­al­ity adds an ex­tra lens through which to un­der­stand the lived ex­pe­ri­ences of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>These ideas orig­i­nated in Amer­ica but are fast be­ing adopted by many de­vel­oped so­ci­eties. Con­se­quently, the young here are be­com­ing so­cially en­light­ened to con­front un­fair treat­ment, alien­ation and prej­u­dices.</p>
    <p>They are mo­ti­vated to re­act and re­spond, as they are in­spired by ideals of free­dom, lib­erty and hu­man rights – ideals de­fined by the West but adopted by many young peo­ple around the world, in­clud­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, ideals and so­ci­etal norms which are cher­ished by Sin­ga­porean so­ci­ety do not carry as much weight with some young Sin­ga­pore­ans, when it comes to their im­pulse to re­spond to dif­fi­cult is­sues of race or re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>There­fore, the con­cern is that con­ver­sa­tions by the young on sen­si­tive is­sues of race and re­li­gion may not take into ac­count the na­ture of Sin­ga­pore’s com­plex di­ver­sity as well as norms that de­fine Sin­ga­porean so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>An in­stance of the clash be­tween the two norms for dis­course took place dur­ing the gen­eral elec­tion cam­paign, when Work­ers’ Party can­di­date Raeesah Khan’s past so­cial me­dia posts about racism were widely re­ported. Many, es­pe­cially older Sin­ga­pore­ans, found her strong views on race dis­turb­ing or of­fen­sive, but many young Sin­ga­pore­ans be­lieved she was sur­fac­ing dif­fi­cult but nec­es­sary is­sues.</p>
    <p>The ex­is­tence of dif­fer­ent modes of con­ver­sa­tion about race may be the rea­son for the min­is­ter’s cau­tious ap­proach when he pointed out con­sid­er­a­tions that ought to be taken into ac­count. These are the need for the stu­dents to be fa­cil­i­tated, and the im­por­tance of ap­pre­ci­at­ing that the con­ver­sa­tions take place in the unique con­text of Sin­ga­porean so­ci­ety. This is where the chal­lenge be­gins. How can ground rules be in­tro­duced and re­spected without caus­ing the young to feel that they are im­posed from above.</p>
    <p>It is crit­i­cal that youth’s trust be won over so they can be per­suaded that the con­ver­sa­tion about race and re­li­gion can take place in an open and fair man­ner.</p>
    <p>Still, par­tic­i­pants have to re­alise that con­ver­sa­tions across race and re­li­gion are not a mat­ter of ca­su­ally talk­ing to one an­other. They re­quire a con­ducive mind­set and a thoughtful ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Con­ver­sa­tions across race or re­li­gion as a dis­ci­pline and so­cial prac­tice is a rel­a­tively re­cent phe­nom­e­non, though re­li­gions, eth­nic­i­ties and cul­tures have en­coun­tered one an­other very early in hu­man his­tory.</p>
    <p>In­deed, for the first half of the 20th cen­tury, hu­mans were scep­ti­cal about the wis­dom of con­vers­ing across re­li­gion and even race. How­ever, this sit­u­a­tion could no longer con­tinue af­ter World War II as the world be­gan to be dom­i­nated by con­ver­gences due to the prac­ti­cal needs of hu­man so­ci­ety. These needs in­clude com­mer­cial trans­ac­tions, pur­suit of knowl­edge and a mul­ti­tude of so­cial in­ter­course.</p>
    <p>Hu­mans are there­fore forced to in­ter­act with one an­other, co­ex­ist and ex­pe­ri­ence the “oth­er­ness” (those from other re­li­gions and races) – as class­mates, neigh­bours, friends.</p>
    <p>En­coun­ters with peo­ple from other back­grounds – eth­nic or re­li­gious – are no longer a mat­ter of choice, since the very essence of hu­man­ity amid di­ver­sity is the need to be com­mu­nica­tive across iden­tity mark­ers.</p>
    <p>Three ways to talk openly</p>
    <p>Con­ver­sa­tion is a two-way street. There is, there­fore, al­ways a ten­sion in con­ver­sa­tions – be­tween com­mit­ment to one’s iden­tity, and be­ing open and em­brac­ing of the other from a dif­fer­ent race or re­li­gion. The chal­lenge in such con­ver­sa­tions is to find a bal­ance be­tween the two com­pet­ing con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>This has been con­sid­er­ably dis­cussed by schol­ars of in­ter-cul­tural and in­ter-re­li­gious con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Schol­ars like Dr Leonard Swi­dler, a doyen of in­ter-re­li­gious di­a­logue, have un­der­scored the im­por­tance of mak­ing such con­ver­sa­tions fair and en­gag­ing without any side feeling sup­pressed or alien­ated.</p>
    <p>There are three ways to help en­sure con­ver­sa­tions across race and re­li­gion are fair and open.</p>
    <p>First, the young need to recog­nise that the con­ver­sa­tion is not a de­bate to win an ar­gu­ment.</p>
    <p>The con­ver­sa­tion is not about con­vert­ing the other party to one’s be­liefs. The con­ver­sa­tion is not about “preach­ing” or teach­ing the “ig­no­rant”. The ob­jec­tive is to seek clar­i­fi­ca­tion, an­swers and knowl­edge without im­pos­ing one’s idea on the other side.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the con­ver­sa­tion can take place only be­tween equals. The con­ver­sa­tion­al­ists must never be con­de­scend­ing. There should never be the feeling of su­pe­ri­or­ity. The ob­jec­tive of the con­ver­sa­tion is not to prove that one side has the mo­nop­oly of knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Third, there is the need to be open and em­pa­thetic to un­der­stand from the other per­son’s per­spec­tive and try and ex­plain us­ing the other per­son’s fram­ing, yet main­tain­ing one’s be­lief.</p>
    <p>If each party adopts this at­ti­tude, then the con­ver­sa­tion will re­sult in both sides grow­ing through will­ing­ness to un­der­stand each other.</p>
    <p>Don’t avoid dif­fer­ences</p>
    <p>Adopt­ing the cor­rect ap­proach for an open and fair con­ver­sa­tion is as im­por­tant as the con­ver­sa­tion it­self. Con­ver­sa­tions on emo­tive sub­jects such as race and re­li­gion con­sist of two parts: the com­mon­al­i­ties and au­then­tic dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts of in­ter-cul­tural and in­ter-re­li­gious con­ver­sa­tion ad­vise deal­ing first with is­sues that have the best prospects of find­ing com­mon­al­i­ties. Con­vers­ing about what is shared in com­mon will build the mu­tual trust for par­tic­i­pants to ad­dress au­then­tic dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>It is not in the spirit of open and fair con­ver­sa­tion to avoid dif­fer­ences. In fact, the real value of con­ver­sa­tions across race and re­li­gion is for each party to be aware of the dif­fer­ences, have keen in­ter­est in them, ap­pre­ci­ate the im­por­tance of such dif­fer­ences to the other side, and seek to gen­uinely un­der­stand them and un­learn mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­mon be­lief is that a con­ver­sa­tion about dif­fer­ences will weaken the re­li­gious faith and eth­nic un­der­pin­nings of par­tic­i­pants. It is usu­ally not so. There is an ex­cel­lent op­por­tu­nity for con­ver­sa­tion across race and re­li­gion dom­i­nated by trust and open­ness to deepen the self-un­der­stand­ing of one’s faith as well as tra­di­tions, and for one to be open to re­ceiv­ing the beauty of other cul­tures and re­li­gions. As a re­sult, one’s in­ter­ra­cial and in­ter-re­li­gious lit­er­acy will be in­creased.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing cer­tain ground rules for mean­ing­ful, open dis­cus­sions of race and re­li­gion can help Sin­ga­pore­ans un­der­stand one an­other bet­ter. It can, for ex­am­ple, help the dif­fer­ent gen­er­a­tions un­der­stand one an­other’s views on race and re­li­gion, and ap­pre­ci­ate the dif­fer­ent views.</p>
    <p>How­ever, such con­ver­sa­tions must start from the bot­tom line that time-hon­oured norms and val­ues ought to be pre­served for so­ci­ety to re­main an­chored and main­tain sta­bil­ity. These norms and val­ues in­clude re­spect­ing dif­fer­ences, tol­er­ance and ap­pre­ci­a­tion of one an­other’s prac­tices and be­liefs, and em­pha­sis­ing sta­bil­ity for the good of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
