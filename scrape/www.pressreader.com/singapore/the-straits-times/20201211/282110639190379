    <p>Mi­grant work­ers from ap­proved dor­mi­to­ries can now use com­mu­nal cook­ing fa­cil­i­ties to whip up their own food on rest days, on top of re­ceiv­ing reg­u­lar catered meals from their em­ploy­ers on work days.</p>
    <p>They can also use recre­ational fa­cil­i­ties such as gyms and bas­ket­ball courts, as long as the dor­mi­tory op­er­a­tors have been given the green light for them to do so.</p>
    <p>This eas­ing of re­stric­tions be­gan last month and is part of a cal­i­brated ap­proach be­ing taken by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The rea­son is that the threat of Covid-19 cases resur­fac­ing in the dorms has not gone away, said the chief of the Min­istry of Man­power’s (MOM) As­sur­ance, Care and En­gage­ment (Ace) Group, Mr Tung Yui Fai, yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We still need to keep an eye on the pan­demic,” he said.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions on the more than 300,000 work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries were in­tro­duced fol­low­ing a surge in Covid-19 cases in the dorms in April.</p>
    <p>De­spite the lat­est changes, the work­ers are still largely re­quired to stay in their dorms ex­cept when they are go­ing to work or run­ning es­sen­tial er­rands.</p>
    <p>On rest days, how­ever, they can visit spec­i­fied recre­ation cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Mr Tung said: “When it comes to mi­grant work­ers go­ing back to the com­mu­nity for ac­tiv­i­ties, I think that over time, we will get there, we will push for it. But first of all, the con­di­tions must be right.” He did not spec­ify a time­frame for this.</p>
    <p>One of the con­di­tions will be for con­tact trac­ing to be car­ried out ef­fec­tively, which means that all mi­grant work­ers have to be equipped with, and adopt the use of, a con­tact trac­ing de­vice.</p>
    <p>The de­vices that will be used by mi­grant work­ers liv­ing or work­ing in dorms, or who are in the con­struc­tion, ma­rine ship­yard and process sec­tors, are called BluePass to­kens.</p>
    <p>These to­kens, which are now be­ing dis­trib­uted to the work­ers, are com­pat­i­ble with the TraceTo­gether to­ken or app, which means they can ex­change in­for­ma­tion with one another.</p>
    <p>Mr Tung, 56, a for­mer brigadier­gen­eral in the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces, said the mis­sion of the Ace Group, a new MOM division that has taken over the work of the in­ter­a­gency task force in charge of mi­grant worker wel­fare in dorms, will con­tinue be­yond the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ace Group of­fi­cers are MOM’s eyes and ears on the ground.</p>
    <p>They flag po­ten­tial is­sues and col­lect feed­back from groups, in­clud­ing work­ers and em­ploy­ers, while help­ing to iden­tify and an­tic­i­pate what contin­gency plans need to be</p>
    <p>in place for a fu­ture cri­sis, be it a health or any other cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The group, whose staff strength ex­ceeds 1,000, will also en­gage stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions that are keen to work with it.</p>
    <p>Mr Tung said the de­ploy­ment of the For­ward As­sur­ance and Sup­port Teams (Fast) to work with dorm op­er­a­tors to re­spond quickly to the work­ers’ es­sen­tial needs has proven to be use­ful and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>One area that Ace Group is work­ing on with its part­ners is the is­sue of new hous­ing stan­dards for mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>They are be­ing pi­loted at the new Quick Build Dor­mi­to­ries that form part of the short- to medium-term hous­ing for mi­grant work­ers. Among other things, each res­i­dent will have 6 sq m of liv­ing space, com­pared with 4.5 sq m be­fore.</p>
    <p>Ace has re­ceived feed­back from dorm op­er­a­tors that they may need ex­tra help to meet the new stan­dards, in­clud­ing fi­nan­cial aid or a lease ex­ten­sion for their dorms.</p>
    <p>Sup­port mea­sures for the op­er­a­tors will be un­veiled when new hous­ing re­quire­ments for mi­grant work­ers are an­nounced next year, Mr Tung said.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing Fast teams on the ground to do en­gage­ments di­rectly, un­der­stand­ing the chal­lenges... will help shape our pol­i­cy­mak­ing in a more holis­tic man­ner.”</p>
