    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dia passed eight mil­lion coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, and the world’s se­cond worsthit coun­try is brac­ing it­self for a new wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>There have also been more than 120,000 deaths across the coun­try of 1.3 bil­lion peo­ple, ac­cord­ing to the lat­est gov­ern­ment fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Only the United States has seen more in­fec­tions, with 9.1 mil­lion con­firmed cases and nearly 230,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>In­dia has one of the world’s low­est death rates from the virus and the gov­ern­ment has high­lighted the slow­ing num­ber of new in­fec­tions in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>But the au­thor­i­ties are pre­par­ing for a new surge af­ter Deep­avali, the coun­try’s most im­por­tant re­li­gious fes­ti­val, on Nov 14.</p>
    <p>Tex­tiles Min­is­ter Sm­riti Irani has be­come the lat­est of sev­eral Cab­i­net mem­bers to test pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Harsh Vard­han said in a re­cent state­ment: “All states need to be care­ful dur­ing the com­ing fes­tive sea­son. This cau­tion must be ex­er­cised for the next three months at least.”</p>
    <p>A strin­gent lock­down im­posed in March has grad­u­ally been eased as the gov­ern­ment seeks to re­boot the econ­omy af­ter the loss of mil­lions of jobs na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts say this has helped spread the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>New Delhi recorded 5,000 new cases on Wed­nes­day, its high­est daily fig­ure since the out­break of the pan­demic. Of­fi­cials have warned that the cap­i­tal city could see more than 10,000 cases a day in the next wave.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts have said crowds gath­er­ing for Deep­avali and other fes­ti­vals, colder tem­per­a­tures and the an­nual win­ter pol­lu­tion cri­sis could worsen the im­pact of coro­n­avirus cases in Delhi.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are also wor­ried about the south­ern state of Ker­ala and West Ben­gal in the east, which have seen wor­ry­ing spikes in cases.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial cap­i­tal Mum­bai, In­dia’s worst-hit city, is adding about 2,000 cases a day.</p>
    <p>Dr Suresh Ku­mar Rathi, an epi­demi­ol­o­gist from the health char­ity Pub­lic Health Foun­da­tion of In­dia, said that if the coun­try took “proper pre­cau­tions” now it could beat a new wave of in­fec­tions, but lack of dis­ci­pline would lead to a “dis­as­trous” un­rav­el­ling of re­cent gains.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi has also warned the pub­lic in re­cent speeches that they were be­ing “care­less” in giv­ing up so­cial dis­tanc­ing and other pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>“The virus is still out there. It thrives on our com­pla­cency,” Mr Modi said in an in­ter­view with the Eco­nomic Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, In­dia’s Health Min­istry said it is pre­par­ing a de­tailed plan for dis­tri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines in the na­tion, in what is likely to be one of the world’s largest such pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Dr Vinod Paul, a mem­ber of the fed­eral gov­ern­ment plan­ning or­gan­i­sa­tion Niti Aayog, said front­line health work­ers will be the first to be in­oc­u­lated once an ef­fec­tive vac­cine is avail­able.</p>
    <p>Three vac­cines are at dif­fer­ent stages of devel­op­ment in In­dia so far, and a safe can­di­date is ex­pected early next year.</p>
    <p>Two In­dian drug man­u­fac­tur­ers, Cadila Health­care and Bharat Biotech In­ter­na­tional, are both con­duct­ing stage two hu­man clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>The Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia, the world’s largest vac­cine pro­ducer, is work­ing on Co­vishield, the can­di­date be­ing de­vel­oped by the Univer­sity of Ox­ford and As­traZeneca, and has re­ceived ap­proval for phase three tri­als.</p>
    <p>While busi­nesses and cin­e­mas have slowly started to re­open, schools and col­leges re­main shut in most cities in In­dia.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional flights are se­verely limited, and In­dia has air links with only a small num­ber of coun­tries – in­clud­ing the US, France, Ger­many and Bri­tain.</p>
