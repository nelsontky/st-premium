    <p>BER­LIN • The co-founder of BioNTech said yes­ter­day it was “highly likely” that its vac­cine against the coro­n­avirus works against the mu­tated strain de­tected in Bri­tain, but it could also adapt the vac­cine if nec­es­sary in six weeks, Agence France-Presse (AFP) re­ported.</p>
    <p>“Sci­en­tif­i­cally, it is highly likely that the im­mune re­sponse by this vac­cine also can deal with the new virus vari­ant,” said Dr Ugur Sahin.</p>
    <p>But, if needed, “in prin­ci­ple the beauty of the mes­sen­ger tech­nol­ogy is that we can di­rectly start to en­gi­neer a vac­cine which com­pletely mim­ics this new mu­ta­tion – we could be able to pro­vide a new vac­cine tech­ni­cally within six weeks.”</p>
    <p>Dr Sahin said the vari­ant de­tected in Bri­tain has nine mu­ta­tions, rather than just one as is usu­ally com­mon.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, he voiced con­fi­dence that the vac­cine de­vel­oped with Pfizer would be ef­fi­cient be­cause it “con­tains more than 1,000 amino acids, and only nine of them have changed, so that means 99 per cent of the pro­tein is still the same”, AFP quoted him as say­ing.</p>
    <p>He said tests are be­ing run on the vari­ant, with re­sults ex­pected in two weeks.</p>
    <p>“We have sci­en­tific con­fi­dence that the vac­cine might pro­tect but we will only know it if the ex­per­i­ment is done... we will pub­lish the data as soon as pos­si­ble,” he added.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Pfizer and Moderna are also test­ing their Covid-19 vac­cines against the new strain, CNN re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Moderna ex­pects im­mu­nity from its vac­cine to pro­tect against the vari­ants and is per­form­ing more tests in the com­ing weeks to con­firm, the com­pany said in a state­ment to CNN.</p>
    <p>Pfizer said it is “gen­er­at­ing data” on how well blood sam­ples from peo­ple im­mu­nised with its vac­cine “may be able to neu­tralise the new strain from the UK”, ac­cord­ing to the re­port.</p>
    <p>Pfizer and Moderna did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to Reuters’ re­quests for com­ment.</p>
