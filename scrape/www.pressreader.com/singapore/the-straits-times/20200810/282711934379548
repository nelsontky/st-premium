    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Your fi­nances are mak­ing life a lit­tle dif­fi­cult. You may find your fam­ily has a ready so­lu­tion, even if it is not one you are think­ing of.</p>
    <p>Tau­rus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You come across as sexy. Grab some­one’s at­ten­tion, shake things up with your mate or en­joy the en­ergy that will come your way.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your abil­ity to fo­cus is stronger and it comes in handy as you have at least one big, com­pli­cated pro­ject that needs at­ten­tion. Give it your all.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Try to get your­self out in the world. You have to so­cialise and your en­ergy guar­an­tees that things should go your way.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your big heart opens up a lit­tle more, which could make life re­ally awe­some for those around you. Show peo­ple you care.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22) Com­pat­i­bil­ity is a big is­sue for you and the sit­u­a­tion shows you the way to get along even bet­ter with peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Li­bra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Take care to re­ally work to­gether with those nearby or you are sure to du­pli­cate each other’s ef­forts. Co­op­er­ate to get more things done.</p>
    <p>Scor­pio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You are ril­ing up those around you. That could be for al­most any rea­son, but the odds are good that you are go­ing through a tem­po­rary phase.</p>
    <p>Sagit­tar­ius (Nov 22 - Dec 21) Some­one has been try­ing to reach you and you dis­cover an­swers to some mys­ter­ies. It is a good time to com­mu­ni­cate with peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Capri­corn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) Your cre­ative en­ergy is ter­rific – you can think past al­most any prob­lem and im­press peo­ple with your ideas.</p>
    <p>Aquar­ius (Jan 20 - Feb 18) Genealogy may in­ter­est you. An old story about an an­ces­tor in­trigues you or you just want to find out more about your her­itage.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your en­ergy de­mands com­mu­ni­ca­tion, so even if oth­ers are walling them­selves off, you need to reach out and bridge the gap.</p>
