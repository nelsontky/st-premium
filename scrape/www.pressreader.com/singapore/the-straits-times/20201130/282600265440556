    <p>Par­ents aren’t go­ing to be able to pre­vent their kids from hav­ing ice cream, cook­ies and cakes, so why not give them op­tions that are low in sugar (or even sugar-free) and full of whole­some in­gre­di­ents? ’’ MS NATASHA CHIAM (left, with her month-old daugh­ter Alexan­dra and two-year-old son Chris­tian Lie) on the worry that snacks for chil­dren are highly pro­cessed</p>
    <p>Ms Natasha Chiam is the name be­hind a suc­cess­ful home-grown brand of ice cream, but that is not what she wants your kids to eat.</p>
    <p>In­stead, how about fudgy brown­ies that are 40 per cent zuc­chini (just do not tell the lit­tle ones)? Or choco­late oat­meal raisin nib­bles made with dark choco­late and raw or­ganic sugar, mak­ing them lower in sugar than sim­i­lar cook­ies from other brands?</p>
    <p>If her kids must have ice cream, their ver­sion con­tains cer­ti­fied or­ganic fresh milk and is free of sta­bilis­ers, eggs and gluten. It also uses or­ganic raw, un­re­fined sugar and claims to have 35 to 50 per cent less sugar than reg­u­lar ice cream.</p>
    <p>A 473ml tub costs $16.95, while the nib­bles are $12.90 for 150g and the brown­ies are priced at $22 for eight pieces.</p>
    <p>Ms Chiam, 35, who started The Ice Cream & Cookie Co eight years ago as a side hus­tle while writ­ing for a lo­cal mag­a­zine, launched ICC Kids in Septem­ber. The brand ex­ten­sion was born out of her strug­gles feed­ing her two-yearold, Chris­tian Lie.</p>
    <p>His in­fant eczema woes led to a patch test and she found out he was al­ler­gic to eggs. Also, he be­came a fussy eater when he turned two and it was hard to buy egg-free com­mer­cial bakes for him.</p>
    <p>She started test­ing recipes at home, which be­came part of the ICC Kids range that is sold on­line on www.ice­cream­cook­ieco.com</p>
    <p>“Now, even though he is go­ing through a picky stage, he still en­joys the snacks and they are a great op­tion for school lunch­boxes,” says the trained lawyer, who gave birth to daugh­ter Alexan­dra a month ago.</p>
    <p>It also wor­ried her that many snacks for kids are highly pro­cessed.</p>
    <p>She says: “Although I run an ice cream busi­ness, I be­lieve that kids shouldn’t have too much sugar or salt. Par­ents aren’t go­ing to be able to pre­vent their kids from hav­ing ice cream, cook­ies and cakes, so why not give them op­tions that are low in sugar (or even sugar-free) and full of whole­some in­gre­di­ents like fruit, veg­eta­bles or oats in­stead of the ‘adult’ va­ri­ety?”</p>
    <p>The re­sponse to her health­ier treats has been good, “es­pe­cially from moth­ers who usu­ally have to wake up at 5am to pre­pare their kids’ lunches”. She is look­ing into re­quests for more dairy-free op­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Chiam’s first preg­nancy also sparked an­other busi­ness idea in Kit+Co, which of­fers three types of In­sta­gram-wor­thy hos­pi­tal kits for moth­ers who are about to de­liver.</p>
    <p>She and a friend, lawyer Jes­sica Zhou Jing, 35, de­cided to launch the ven­ture af­ter real­is­ing what a “chore” it was to source for dif­fer­ent items from var­i­ous shops for their ma­ter­nity stays.</p>
    <p>“It’s a time-con­sum­ing and ex­pen­sive process. It is also quite mun­dane – we’re not talk­ing about fun, cute baby out­fits or ex­cit­ing nurs­ery decor, we’re fig­ur­ing out what type of ma­ter­nity pad is best or which breast pad to use and what toi­letries to bring.</p>
    <p>“We thought it would be so convenient to just get it all with one click.”</p>
    <p>The en­try-level Min­i­mal­ist Kit ($188) in­cludes items such as a new­born out­fit made from or­ganic cot­ton, a bam­boo fibre baby swad­dle, var­i­ous di­a­per sam­ples and a birth an­nounce­ment card for baby’s first #ootd.</p>
    <p>Ms Chiam says the re­sponse has been “pos­i­tive” since the kits went on sale about two weeks ago, with The Lux­ury Kit ($368) be­ing the most pop­u­lar choice. Kit+Co is avail­able on­line on www.kitco.sg</p>
    <p>The mumpreneur says: “Post­par­tum is tough and all new moth­ers de­serve to feel pam­pered dur­ing this time.”</p>
