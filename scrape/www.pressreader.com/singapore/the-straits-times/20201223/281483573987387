    <p>Stand­ing on the start­ing blocks at the TYR Pro Swim Se­ries in Rich­mond, Vir­ginia in April last year, Zachary Ian Tan could hardly con­tain his ex­cite­ment at com­pet­ing along­side two-time Olympic cham­pion Caeleb Dres­sel.</p>
    <p>He im­me­di­ately texted his mother, Jillian, af­ter his 200m in­di­vid­ual med­ley (IM) race.</p>
    <p>“It was a su­per fun ex­pe­ri­ence to try and race some­one like Caeleb Dres­sel,” said the 17-year-old na­tional swim­mer, who spe­cialises in the IM and breast­stroke.</p>
    <p>“It mo­ti­vates you to re­ally just get bet­ter and get to that level, to be the best in the world.”</p>
    <p>Get­ting op­por­tu­ni­ties to race against swim­mers of 13-time world cham­pion Dres­sel’s cal­i­bre was one of the rea­sons why Zachary and his fam­ily of six up­rooted their lives in Sin­ga­pore to move to the United States two years ago.</p>
    <p>The teenager, a stu­dent at Ari­zona State Univer­sity Prep Dig­i­tal, saw his ca­reer am­bi­tions handed a boost yes­ter­day as he an­nounced on so­cial me­dia that he is en­rolling at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berke­ley.</p>
    <p>De­spite field­ing of­fers from sev­eral col­leges, he de­cided that UC Berke­ley, where fel­low Sin­ga­pore swim­mer and Olympian Quah Zheng Wen is an un­der­grad­u­ate, would be the best fit for him. He felt that the school has a strong IM pro­gramme and he also con­nected well with head coach David Dur­den, who will also lead the United States men’s team at next year’s Tokyo Olympics.</p>
    <p>He will en­rol there in 2022 – if he is able to get de­fer­ment from na­tional ser­vice – or 2024.</p>
    <p>“They push each other ev­ery sin­gle day and among them are Olympians, world record hold­ers who are striv­ing to be the very best,” said Zachary, who placed ninth in the 100m freestyle at the Fina World Ju­nior Swim­ming Cham­pi­onships last year to fin­ish the top Asian swim­mer.</p>
    <p>“Just be­ing in such a com­pet­i­tive en­vi­ron­ment is re­ally go­ing to help me take it up to the next level.”</p>
    <p>Zachary, who holds four na­tional boys’ Un­der-14 and two Un­der-17 records, will join a group of USbased lo­cal swim­mers com­pris­ing Quah Jing Wen (Texas A&M) and Dar­ren Lim (Georgia Tech), while Christie Chue will be head­ing to Florida In­ter­na­tional Univer­sity next Au­gust.</p>
    <p>At Berke­ley, he can look to some of its alumni for in­spi­ra­tion as he chases his dream of com­pet­ing at the 2024 Paris Olympics. The univer­sity’s swim­ming pro­gramme has pro­duced the likes of three­time Olympic cham­pion Ryan Mur­phy and sprint king An­thony Ervin, who has three golds from Olympic ap­pear­ances in 2000 and 2016.</p>
    <p>The past two years spent in the US may not be all rosy, par­tic­u­larly af­ter a shoul­der in­jury sus­tained in March left him out of ac­tion for six months. But Zachary said his love for swim­ming has grown since the move, which al­lowed him to race fre­quently be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Jillian, who is a home­maker, has also no­ticed a change in her el­dest child, adding: “For many of the meets, he had to travel alone or with his team. We weren’t with him and could not be as in­volved in his swim­ming as we had been in Sin­ga­pore. It was a new ex­pe­ri­ence, he has grown to be more in­de­pen­dent, grown to know what he wants.”</p>
    <p>While he is un­sure of when his next race will be, Zachary is happy to be back in train­ing again as he works to­wards his Olympic goal, say­ing: “I’m just re­ally thank­ful that my shoul­der is re­cov­er­ing and I’m start­ing to feel fast again. Over­all, my ex­pe­ri­ence this year has made me cher­ish swim­ming even more and I’m rar­ing to go way more than ever.”</p>
    <p>They push each other ev­ery sin­gle day and among them are Olympians, world record hold­ers.</p>
