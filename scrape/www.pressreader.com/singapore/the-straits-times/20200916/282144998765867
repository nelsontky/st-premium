    <p>The own­ers of a dog that was put down in April and the vet­eri­nar­i­ans in­volved in the case were found to have not breached the law and code of ethics after in­ves­ti­ga­tions by the An­i­mal and Vet­eri­nary Ser­vice (AVS).</p>
    <p>The eu­thana­sia of Loki drew wide­spread pub­lic at­ten­tion ear­lier this year, with some ne­ti­zens al­leg­ing its own­ers and the vet put down the dog un­nec­es­sar­ily.</p>
    <p>In its four-month-long in­ves­ti­ga­tion, AVS said it found that there was “no fail­ure in duty of care or cru­elty” by the own­ers – a mar­ried cou­ple – as they had pro­vided Loki with its “ba­sic needs such as food, water, shel­ter and vet­eri­nary at­ten­tion”.</p>
    <p>Three vets from two clin­ics in the case were found to have com­plied with the code of ethics for vet­eri­nar­i­ans and other reg­u­la­tions. In ad­di­tion, there was no breach of the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act by all par­ties as “vet­eri­nary acts that up­hold pub­lic safety” were con­sid­ered an essen­tial ser­vice dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>No fur­ther ac­tion will be taken against those in­volved, said AVS in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The case sur­faced on May 6 when a vol­un­teer at an­i­mal wel­fare group Ex­clu­sively Mon­grels (EM) al­leged in a now-deleted Face­book post that Loki’s own­ers had eu­thanised their healthy dog.</p>
    <p>AVS be­gan in­ves­ti­ga­tions the next day.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple adopted Loki from EM in De­cem­ber 2017 when it was around five to six months old.</p>
    <p>Over the next two years, it grew to be about 25kg, and was as­sessed by vets to be more “con­fi­dent and con­fronta­tional”. It also had “panic at­tacks with no known trig­ger”. Dur­ing this time, it had at­tacked both hu­mans and dogs on about 10 oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>AVS said the own­ers had sought op­tions – such as med­i­ca­tion, train­ing and ex­plor­ing re­hom­ing al­ter­na­tives – over a pe­riod of more than a year.</p>
    <p>These were not suc­cess­ful and Loki con­tin­ued to bite peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The last straw came on April 19, when Loki bit one of the own­ers on the lip with­out warn­ing.</p>
    <p>They had also no­ticed that it was un­com­fort­able and ner­vous around their new­born child.</p>
    <p>The own­ers as­sessed that Loki was a risk to the fam­ily and re­quested to eu­thanise it. The vet­eri­nar­ian agreed, said AVS.</p>
    <p>On April 20, Loki was put down in the pres­ence of its own­ers.</p>
    <p>EM’s di­rec­tor Kevin Neo told The Straits Times the group is “ex­tremely dis­ap­pointed” with the out­come.</p>
    <p>AVS said a work group, chaired by Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Tan Kiat How, has been formed to study the stan­dards and guide­lines re­lated to the re­hom­ing and adop­tion of an­i­mals here.</p>
