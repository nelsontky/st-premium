    <p>Do you spend hours on your knees clean­ing the floors with a hand cloth? Do you hand-wash all of your fam­ily’s soiled clothes, in­clud­ing the chil­dren’s army uni­forms? Do you wash all your toi­lets ev­ery day? Do you sleep in a store­room that is too small for a reg­u­lar-sized sin­gle bed?</p>
    <p>This is the life that many of our for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers (FDWs) face daily, just so that many of us can go to work with­out hav­ing to worry about meals, house­hold chores, our chil­dren or el­derly or sick fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>In the last few months, I have been try­ing to match sev­eral FDW friends with po­ten­tial em­ploy­ers, and have found a dis­turb­ing trend.</p>
    <p>Just be­cause they are pay­ing to have a helper, peo­ple in­sist on the FDW do­ing un­nec­es­sary man­ual labour, like hand-wash­ing all clothes, de­spite the avail­abil­ity of modern elec­tri­cal ap­pli­ances.</p>
    <p>More­over, there are sur­pris­ing re­quests like hav­ing to wash the bath­rooms and mop the floors daily be­fore six in the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>And peo­ple seem des­per­ate for help but are un­will­ing to pro­vide de­cent ac­com­mo­da­tion, like a room where the helper will feel safe, have some pri­vacy and can store her own be­long­ings.</p>
    <p>Sadly, many peo­ple are also un­will­ing to of­fer more in terms of salary and those who think they are gen­er­ous in pay­ing $800 of­ten come up with many ad­di­tional small jobs to keep their helpers as busy as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>What are we as a so­ci­ety be­com­ing when we treat these guests in our homes, who are so es­sen­tial to the smooth func­tion­ing of our so­ci­ety, as in­vis­i­ble and un­seen? What has hap­pened to cour­tesy and gra­cious­ness?</p>
