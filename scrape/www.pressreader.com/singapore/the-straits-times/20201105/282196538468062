    <p>Shop­pers hop­ing to make their last pur­chases at the two Robin­sons out­lets here may have un­til at least the mid­dle or the end of next month to do so.</p>
    <p>A doc­u­ment an­swer­ing cus­tomers’ fre­quently asked ques­tions that was up­loaded on­line by Robin­sons’ ap­pointed liq­uida­tor Korda-Men­tha on Tues­day said that it was hope­ful of ex­e­cut­ing a sales cam­paign un­til ap­prox­i­mately the mid­dle to end of next month.</p>
    <p>The 162-year-old de­part­ment store an­nounced last Fri­day that it is clos­ing its last two stores in Sin­ga­pore at The Heeren and Raf­fles City Shop­ping Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment led to snaking queues at both stores over the week­end, and an out­pour­ing of sad­ness from cus­tomers and staff.</p>
    <p>The re­tailer said the de­ci­sion to liq­ui­date was prompted by a range of fac­tors, in­clud­ing chang­ing con­sumer tastes and cost pres­sures such as rent.</p>
    <p>“The over­ar­ch­ing busi­ness model of de­part­ment stores is out­dated,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Robin­sons also said that the de­ci­sion came after an “in­abil­ity to con­tinue op­er­a­tions due to weak de­mand at de­part­ment stores”.</p>
    <p>While the re­tailer’s e-com­merce plat­forms are no longer op­er­a­tional, shop­pers can con­tinue to visit its brick-and-mor­tar stores for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Korda-Men­tha said that it has not had the op­por­tu­nity to fully re­view the rea­sons for Robin­sons’ fail­ure at this stage, but noted the store’s recog­ni­tion of shift­ing con­sumer trends from off­line to on­line spend­ing and that the Covid-19 pan­demic has ex­ac­er­bated this shift.</p>
    <p>On when sales at the two stores will end, Korda-Men­tha said it was still work­ing with var­i­ous stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing key sup­pli­ers and land­lords, to “hope­fully agree” on a time­line.</p>
    <p>“Once we have agree­ment with these crit­i­cal stake­hold­ers, we will be able to make an an­nounce­ment in this re­gard,” it added.</p>
