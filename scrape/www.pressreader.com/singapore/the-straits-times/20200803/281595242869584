    <p>Some stu­dents are wor­ried that they will not get a fair shot at the Di­rect School Ad­mis­sion scheme af­ter the Na­tional School Games were can­celled amid the Covid-19 cri­sis. And with no tri­als, se­lec­tors will have to in­ter­view and as­sess ap­pli­cants on­line and watch their old match videos.</p>
    <p>Ahead of this year’s Na­tional School Games (NSG), rugby player Jared Khuan was rar­ing to get on the field with his Bukit Ba­tok Sec­ondary School team af­ter he was handed the cap­tain’s arm­band.</p>
    <p>The 16-year-old had hoped to end his grad­u­at­ing year on a high by lead­ing the side to the Bowl tro­phy in the B Divi­sion af­ter plac­ing fourth last year.</p>
    <p>A good re­sult at the NSG would have also boosted his chances of se­cur­ing a place at St An­drew’s Ju­nior Col­lege via the Di­rect School Ad­mis­sion (DSA) scheme.</p>
    <p>But the Sec­ondary 4 stu­dent-ath­lete’s plan has now hit a speed bump, af­ter the NSG was can­celled in May ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The ax­ing of the Games also puts him in a dis­ad­van­taged po­si­tion as he has only two years of ex­pe­ri­ence play­ing in the NSG in­stead of three like his peers from other schools. Bukit Ba­tok Sec­ondary did not have enough mem­bers to field a team when he was in Sec­ondary 1.</p>
    <p>“I was wor­ried that the can­cel­la­tion of NSG would af­fect my chances for DSA,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I also felt that we had a very good chance at win­ning the NSG this year so I thought that could help my chances for this year’s DSA sig­nif­i­cantly.”</p>
    <p>In­tro­duced i n 2004, the DSA scheme gives stu­dents a chance to gain en­try into sec­ondary schools or ju­nior col­leges (JCs) based on their achieve­ments and tal­ents, be­yond their aca­demic re­sults.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Covid-19, stu­dent-ath­letes would at­tend in-per­son se­lec­tion tri­als with other ap­pli­cants at the schools.</p>
    <p>But the coro­n­avirus outbreak has seen this year’s DSA ex­er­cise move on­line, with the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion an­nounc­ing i n May that schools will not hold phys­i­cal tri­als or face-to-face in­ter­views as part of their se­lec­tion process to en­sure that there is no in­ter-min­gling of stu­dents across schools. On­line in­ter­views will be con­ducted with ap­pli­cants in­stead.</p>
    <p>The se­lec­tion pe­riod for this year is from July 1 to Sept 14 for sec­ondary schools, and from June 29 to Sept 4 for JCs.</p>
    <p>There are 146 sec­ondary schools and 20 JCs par­tic­i­pat­ing in this year’s DSA. Last year, 3,500 pupils suc­cess­fully ap­plied to sec­ondary schools through the scheme, amount­ing to 8.7 per cent of the 40,256 chil­dren who sat for the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>As the an­nual NSG, which usu­ally takes place from Jan­uary to Au­gust and fea­tures 60,000 stu­dent-ath­letes, is a main plat­form for schools to scout tal­ents, its can­cel­la­tion, cou­pled with the lack of phys­i­cal tri­als, has thrown up some chal­lenges for schools.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, coaches and teach­ers have had to come up with dif­fer­ent meth­ods to as­sess the stu­dent-ath­letes’ skills, such as by watch­ing tour­na­ment videos from pre­vi­ous years and mak­ing them do ex­er­cises dur­ing the e-in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>How­ever, not all the ap­pli­cants fea­tured reg­u­larly in last year’s com­pe­ti­tion, mak­ing it hard to prop­erly eval­u­ate their abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Tam Choon Chor, Nanyang Ju­nior Col­lege’s (NYJC) vol­ley­ball teacherin-charge, said: “I have some dif­fi­cul­ties (as­sess­ing them) be­cause they weren’t in the main team last year but couldn’t play this year even though they were se­lected be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“I have dif­fi­culty con­firm­ing whether they are good be­cause I need play­ers to have some com­pe­ti­tion ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>Net­ball coach Justin Teh gets ap­pli­cants to demon­strate cer­tain move­ments through shut­tle runs, ver­ti­cal jumps, sin­gle leg hops and ball han­dling ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are lim­i­ta­tions as he feels that some play­ers who are tech­ni­cally sound may not nec­es­sar­ily have game in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard to see any­thing more than the way she runs, catches and throws a ball,” said Teh, who coaches Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Girls’ School and Eunoia Ju­nior Col­lege.</p>
    <p>“Some peo­ple may be good in that as­pect but when it comes to match play, they may not be that great. Then some may not be very skil­ful but they may be very in­tel­li­gent on court so you need both to make a more in­formed de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>Agree­ing, NYJC’s Tam added: “I worry that I may se­lect wrong play­ers by miss­ing out on good play­ers or se­lect­ing play­ers who aren’t so good.”</p>
    <p>I have some dif­fi­cul­ties be­cause they weren’t in the main team last year but couldn’t play this year even though they were se­lected be­cause of Covid-19. ’’</p>
