    <p>The Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice (NCSS) is step­ping up its campaign to sup­port those with men­tal health needs and raise aware­ness of how to help them re­cover and build re­silience. The coun­cil yes­ter­day launched the third edi­tion of Be­yond the La­bel, its men­tal health anti-stigma campaign.</p>
    <p>With the ex­pected rise in men­tal health needs as liveli­hoods are hit by the Covid-19 cri­sis and peo­ple grow in­creas­ingly anx­ious, the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice (NCSS) is step­ping up its na­tional campaign to sup­port those with such con­di­tions and raise public aware­ness of how to help them re­cover and build re­silience.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil yes­ter­day launched the third edi­tion of its na­tional men­tal health anti-stigma campaign Be­yond the La­bel, amid greater men­tal health chal­lenges posed by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said at the vir­tual launch of the campaign that a re­cent NCSS poll of 900 re­spon­dents found that Sin­ga­pore­ans – es­pe­cially those with pre-ex­ist­ing men­tal health con­di­tions – ex­pe­ri­enced more psy­cho­log­i­cal dis­tress dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 cri­sis brought the is­sue of men­tal health and well­ness to the fore­front, he said, not­ing that many were anx­ious and con­cerned about con­tract­ing the virus, los­ing their jobs and be­ing so­cially iso­lated. Men­tal health needs are ex­pected to rise as liveli­hoods are hit and peo­ple grow in­creas­ingly anx­ious.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has taken steps to strengthen sup­port for peo­ple with men­tal health con­di­tions, said Mr Masa­gos, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Health. He cited the Youth Men­tal Well-Be­ing Net­work, which was set up in Fe­bru­ary to pool ideas and ef­forts to bol­ster youth men­tal health, and said over 1,000 peo­ple have since re­sponded to the call.</p>
    <p>A short film, The Clock, was also screened at the launch. The film by direc­tor Alvin Lee of Chuan Pic­tures de­picts the strug­gles of a fa­ther who, de­spite hav­ing lost his job, had to care for his wife, son and el­derly par­ents dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, one of four speak­ers dur­ing a panel dis­cus­sion, said he hopes the film will en­cour­age more peo­ple fac­ing men­tal health chal­lenges to seek help early, and that the film aims to re­duce stigma by show­ing that men­tal health con­di­tions are not as scary as many peo­ple think.</p>
    <p>Mr Jeremy Chan, a former in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy pro­fes­sional who is now the pro­gramme ex­ec­u­tive for the men­tal health char­ity Re­silience Col­lec­tive, said he could re­late to the film’s pro­tag­o­nist.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said he ex­pe­ri­enced post-trau­matic stress dis­or­der and clin­i­cal de­pres­sion af­ter the death of his el­derly mother, whom he had been car­ing for, in 2014. He said the hard­est part of seek­ing help was the stigma of be­ing seen as hav­ing a men­tal health con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>An­other speaker, Ms Gay­athri San­drasegaran, a se­nior so­cial worker from Viriya Com­mu­nity Ser­vices, said she no­ticed more peo­ple from mid­dle-in­come house­holds seek­ing men­tal health help be­tween April and June. The is­sues were also more com­plex com­pared with be­fore the Covid-19 outbreak, she said, with more seek­ing help for emo­tional needs and fam­ily prob­lems like par­ent­ing dif­fi­cul­ties.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment Eric Chua, who was also on the panel, spoke of the Gov­ern­ment’s var­i­ous Covid-19 sup­port schemes.</p>
    <p>As part of the campaign, a vir­tual Be­yond the La­bel Fest will be held this week­end on the campaign’s Face­book and YouTube pages.</p>
    <p>The out­reach events in­clude a vir­tual con­cert fea­tur­ing lo­cal artists such as Ste­fanie Sun, Kit Chan, Tosh Zhang, Tau­fik Bati­sah, The Fresh­man, Neko High­way, Ramli Sarip, and mu­si­cians from 3am Mu­sic Col­lec­tive. There will also be work­shops on ac­tiv­i­ties like choco­late mak­ing and Ta­bata ex­er­cise, and di­a­logues on topics re­lated to men­tal health.</p>
