    <p>Thai­land’s bad­minton chief yes­ter­day pledged that next month’s restart tour­na­ments will be the “safest in the world” after heavy­weights China with­drew be­cause of coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>China’s pullout blows a big hole in the draw for the three Bad­minton World Fed­er­a­tion World Tour events from Jan 12 in</p>
    <p>Bangkok, the first in Asia since the Covid-19 shut­down in March.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Bad­minton As­so­ci­a­tion of Thai­land pres­i­dent Patama Leeswad­trakul said it was a re­sult of China’s anti-coro­n­avirus rules that pre­vented the team, who in­clude men’s Olympic cham­pion Chen Long and women’s world No. 2 Chen Yufei, from trav­el­ling, rather than a re­flec­tion on Thai­land’s safety.</p>
    <p>“The rea­son is that the Chi­nese govern­ment doesn’t al­low them to go out of the coun­try – not just for the sport of bad­minton but for all kinds of ath­letes,” she told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>The three back-to-back tour­na­ments, in bio-se­cure bub­ble con­di­tions and be­hind closed doors, cul­mi­nate in the de­layed 2020 World Tour Fi­nals from Jan 27.</p>
    <p>Patama said the Thai govern­ment has been work­ing to en­sure top stan­dards of health, in­clud­ing iso­lat­ing play­ers the minute they get off their flights.</p>
    <p>“This bub­ble com­pe­ti­tion will be the safest in the world,” she added.</p>
    <p>“After Jan 4, no one is al­lowed to en­ter this bub­ble and all the mea­sures and pro­to­col are very strict for the health and safety of ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>While Patama ad­mit­ted that the prospect of play­ing with­out fans was a con­cern for some com­peti­tors, who are wor­ried about how it may af­fect their per­for­mances, there was no other op­tion. “Our bad­minton play­ers also men­tion these same feel­ings... But we have to seal ev­ery­one in the bub­ble for the best health this time,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We are the only tour­na­ment that can host in this world at this time – I mean in­ter­na­tion­ally, glob­ally, at this time of resur­gence.”</p>
    <p>Thai­land has seen a low death toll since it reg­is­tered the first case out­side of China in Jan­uary. But new out­breaks in re­cent weeks have prompted the govern­ment to put cer­tain ar­eas un­der par­tial re­stric­tions after months of rel­a­tive nor­malcy.</p>
