    <p>Of all coun­tries, US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo’s lat­est state­ment on the South China Sea dis­putes is of great­est con­se­quence to its old­est Asian ally, the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Much has been writ­ten about Mr Pom­peo’s em­phatic and un­equiv­o­cal re­jec­tion of China’s ter­ri­to­rial and mar­itime claims.</p>
    <p>Yet, as early as 2014, the US State Depart­ment, in a de­tailed pa­per, Lim­its In The Sea, had al­ready ques­tioned the va­lid­ity of China’s claims based on the United Na­tions Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea. Two years later, the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion reaf­firmed as “fi­nal and bind­ing” the ar­bi­tral tri­bunal award at The Hague, which re­jected China’s nine-dash line and his­toric rights claims as in­com­pat­i­ble with pre­vail­ing in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>The true nov­elty and sig­nif­i­cance of Mr Pom­peo’s state­ment, there­fore, is less the re­jec­tion of China’s claims than the de facto recog­ni­tion of other lit­toral states’ claims in the area.</p>
    <p>Not only has the United States re­jected Bei­jing’s his­toric rights claims over fish­eries re­sources in In­done­sia’s Natuna waters, but it has also ques­tioned claims over the Van­guard Bank and James Shoal, low-tide el­e­va­tions that fall within Viet­namese and Malaysian con­ti­nen­tal shelves.</p>
    <p>The most con­se­quen­tial as­pect of the US’ state­ment, how­ever, con­cerns the Philip­pines’ claims, par­tic­u­larly over the Scar­bor­ough Shoal, Mis­chief Reef and Sec­ond Thomas Shoal.</p>
    <p>And this has ma­jor ram­i­fi­ca­tions for the US-Philip­pine Mu­tual De­fence Treaty (MDT) should trou­ble break out in the dis­puted waters. No won­der Philip­pine De­fence Sec­re­tary Delfin Loren­zana was among the first se­nior of­fi­cials in the re­gion to pub­licly wel­come Mr Pom­peo’s state­ment.</p>
    <p>Since the Nixon ad­min­is­tra­tion, the US has largely adopted a pol­icy of strate­gic am­bi­gu­ity over the pre­cise ex­tent of its com­mit­ments to the Philip­pines in the con­text of South China Sea dis­putes.</p>
    <p>In the 1970s, then Sec­re­tary of State Henry Kissinger was adamant that the US re­mained as neu­tral as pos­si­ble on Philip­pine claims, only of­fer­ing “help­ful po­lit­i­cal ac­tions” since “(we) do not see le­gal ba­sis at this time... for sup­port­ing the claim to Spratlys of one coun­try over that of other claimants”.</p>
    <p>Even in ar­eas where the Philip­pines had estab­lished a ro­bust pres­ence, Dr Kissinger ar­gued that “there are sub­stan­tial doubts that (its) mil­i­tary con­tin­gent on is­land in the Spratly group would come within pro­tec­tion of the (MDT)”. He was, in fact, dis­mis­sive of Philip­pine claims, main­tain­ing “oc­cu­pa­tion could hardly be termed un­con­tested in face of claims and protests of (the) Chi­nese and Viet­namese”.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther did the US side with Manila’s claims over Scar­bor­ough and Sec­ond Thomas shoals, which are well within the coun­try’s Ex­clu­sive Eco­nomic Zone (EEZ).</p>
    <p>The Clinton and Carter ad­min­is­tra­tions made generic pledges to aid the Philip­pines in the event of armed con­flict with a third party in the Pa­cific. But when China oc­cu­pied the Philip­pine-claimed Mis­chief Reef in 1995, the US sim­ply stood by.</p>
    <p>Obama’s ‘bunch of rocks’</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his 2014 visit to Manila, then Pres­i­dent Barack Obama was even more equiv­o­cal, dis­miss­ing Philip­pine-China dis­putes as mis­guided spats over “a bunch of rocks”. This was barely two years af­ter the dan­ger­ous naval stand-off in the Scar­bor­ough Shoal, which ended with the with­drawal of the Philip­pine naval frigate and the sub­se­quent Chi­nese oc­cu­pa­tion of the dis­puted fea­ture.</p>
    <p>Strate­gic am­bi­gu­ity al­lowed the US to claim a sem­blance of “neu­tral­ity”, but mostly at the ex­pense of its most vul­ner­a­ble al­lies such as the Philip­pines. Many Filipinos, most es­pe­cially Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte, have re­ferred to Mr Obama’s re­marks as noth­ing short of the US’ aban­don­ment of its old­est re­gional ally.</p>
    <p>No won­der then that even Mr Loren­zana, de­spite his years as a Wash­ing­ton-based diplo­mat, at one point ques­tioned the util­ity of a Philip­pine-US al­liance and sug­gested scrap­ping the MDT. The lack of faith in the US was also used by Mr Duterte to ar­gue that pur­su­ing com­pro­mise with China was Manila’s best and only choice.</p>
    <p>But as the US-China con­flict es­ca­lates, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has shifted its stance. US As­sis­tant Sec­re­tary of State for East Asian and Pa­cific Af­fairs David R. Stil­well shared dur­ing a Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies panel dis­cus­sion re­cently that the ad­min­is­tra­tion is now en­gaged in “house clean­ing” – namely, rec­ti­fy­ing the short­com­ings of pre­vi­ous ad­min­is­tra­tions.</p>
    <p>Last year, Mr Pom­peo, in a ma­jor de­par­ture from pre­vi­ous US poli­cies, con­firmed the di­rect ap­pli­ca­bil­ity of the MDT to the South China Sea dis­putes, since</p>
    <p>“the South China Sea is part of the Pa­cific, any armed at­tack on any Philip­pine forces, air­craft, or public ves­sels in the South China Sea will trig­ger mu­tual de­fence obli­ga­tions un­der Ar­ti­cle 4 of our mu­tual de­fence treaty”.</p>
    <p>Months later, US Am­bas­sador to the Philip­pines Sung Kim went so far as to ar­gue that the MDT could also ap­ply to “any armed at­tack” by “gov­ern­ment-sanc­tioned mili­tias”.</p>
    <p>In Mr Pom­peo’s lat­est South China Sea state­ment, Wash­ing­ton has upped the ante by ef­fec­tively ar­gu­ing that the Mis­chief Reef and Sec­ond Thomas Shoal be­long to the Philip­pines, since “both... fall fully un­der the Philip­pines’ sovereign rights and ju­ris­dic­tion”.</p>
    <p>There was even im­plicit recog­ni­tion of Manila’s claim over Scar­bor­ough Reef and the Spratly Is­lands “in ar­eas that the tri­bunal found to be in the Philip­pines’ EEZ or on its con­ti­nen­tal shelf”.</p>
    <p>The US also stood by the Philip­pines’ rights to ex­ploit re­sources within its waters, warn­ing against “any uni­lat­eral PRC ac­tions to ex­ploit those re­sources” and “Bei­jing’s ha­rass­ment of Philip­pine fish­eries and off­shore en­ergy devel­op­ment within those ar­eas”.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s pro­gres­sive clar­i­fi­ca­tion of its position on the South China Sea dis­putes may have un­der­mined its claims to neu­tral­ity. But it also pro­vides greater clar­ity on the ex­tent of its com­mit­ment to treaty al­lies such as the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>What this means is that there is now a grow­ing prob­a­bil­ity of US in­ter­ven­tion, un­der the MDT, were China to move ag­gres­sively against the Philip­pines in ei­ther the Sec­ond Thomas Shoal, where Philip­pine troops have been sta­tioned over a grounded ship, or the Scar­bor­ough Shoal, which has yet to be re­claimed or mil­i­tarised.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly no one wants war or a dan­ger­ous es­ca­la­tion in re­gional dis­putes.</p>
    <p>But pre­vi­ous US ad­min­is­tra­tions’ “strate­gic am­bi­gu­ity” has proven far from ef­fec­tive, likely en­cour­ag­ing China’s creep­ing in­tru­sion into Philip­pine waters through­out the decades. Con­versely, the prospect of US in­ter­ven­tion on be­half of its ally could have a de­ter­rent ef­fect, giv­ing pause to fur­ther Chi­nese ad­ven­tur­ism in the South China Sea.</p>
