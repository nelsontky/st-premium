    <p>Fol­low­ing a stretch of more than 10 days with­out Covid-19 com­mu­nity cases here and pos­i­tive up­dates on vac­cine de­vel­op­ments in­ter­na­tion­ally, the Hong Kong-Sin­ga­pore two-way travel bub­ble – her­alded as the world’s first and set to take flight last Sun­day – looked to be a wel­come step in the re­sump­tion of leisure travel by air. Peo­ple would be able to fly be­tween the two cities with­out be­ing quar­an­tined, sub­ject to con­di­tions such as test­ing neg­a­tive for Covid-19 more than once. Alas, it was not to be. The plan has been de­ferred due to the rise in Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong. Un­der the ar­range­ment, a two-week sus­pen­sion would kick in if the seven-day mov­ing av­er­age of the daily num­ber of un­linked lo­cal cases is more than five for ei­ther Sin­ga­pore or Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>The lat­est de­vel­op­ment shows just how del­i­cate and cau­tious the process of re-open­ing bor­ders needs to be. The Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties said on Sun­day that the epi­demic in the city was wors­en­ing rapidly, with new cases ev­ery day in the dou­ble dig­its. This is not unique to Hong Kong. In­fec­tions are ris­ing in 69 coun­tries, and the num­ber of deaths due to Covid-19 has passed 250,000 in the United States. South Korea – widely praised for bring­ing the dis­ease un­der con­trol, tight­ened so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures af­ter re­port­ing hun­dreds of fresh cases over con­sec­u­tive days. With the pan­demic show­ing no sign of slow­ing down, tightly-con­trolled air travel seems likely to be the modus operandi for some time to come.</p>
    <p>While Hong Kong’s new un­linked cases re­ported over the week­end took the rolling sev­en­day av­er­age to 3.86 – which was be­low the trig­ger point – a judg­ment call was still made to in­voke the sus­pen­sion. The de­ci­sion to err on the side of cau­tion is a pru­dent one, given that there is the risk of si­lent trans­mis­sion chains. The de­ci­sion is meant to pro­tect pub­lic health on both sides, not just in Hong Kong. Sin­ga­pore, too, has on its part im­posed stricter re­stric­tions on trav­ellers coming from Malaysia and Ja­pan, fol­low­ing the ris­ing num­ber of cases in the two coun­tries. Un­til a vac­cine is found that is safe and can be widely dis­trib­uted, it is likely that travel will be sub­ject to such start-stop spurts.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers who had their plans de­ferred are un­der­stand­ably dis­ap­pointed. But even so, there should be no un­due rush to get the flights off the ground again. Far bet­ter to do so only when the sit­u­a­tion is safe, and likely to boost con­fi­dence that the air travel bub­ble con­cept can work. Mean­while, travel for leisure should be seen as a bonus, not a ne­ces­sity, given the widely vary­ing lev­els of in­fec­tion and risk in the re­gion and else­where. Mea­sures still have to be cal­i­brated and ap­plied coun­try by coun­try, which will take time. If travel is to have any hope of re­sum­ing among more ju­ris­dic­tions, it is bet­ter to be safe than sorry.</p>
