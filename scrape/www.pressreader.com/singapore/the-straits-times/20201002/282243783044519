    <p>TOKYO • The Tokyo Stock Ex­change (TSE) yes­ter­day halted trad­ing for the en­tire day, freez­ing the buy­ing and sell­ing of thou­sands of com­pa­nies’ shares in the worstever out­age in the world’s third­largest eq­uity mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan Ex­change Group, the op­er­a­tor of the TSE, said the prob­lem was be­cause of a failed switchover to back­ups fol­low­ing a hard­ware break­down. The ex­change was to re­place hard­ware and restart its sys­tem yes­ter­day, aim­ing to re­sume trad­ing as nor­mal to­day, TSE pres­i­dent Koichiro Miya­hara said in a press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The ex­change said it would no­tify in­vestors at around 7.30pm lo­cal time yes­ter­day if it was ready to restart to­day.</p>
    <p>“We have caused great in­con­ve­nience to many mar­ket par­tic­i­pants, in­vestors and listed com­pa­nies,” said Mr Miya­hara. “We will take thor­ough steps to prevent a re­cur­rence.”</p>
    <p>The is­sue damp­ened in­vestor sen­ti­ment fol­low­ing a pos­i­tive US stock mar­ket per­for­mance overnight and clo­sures in other ma­jor mar­kets in the re­gion, in­clud­ing China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Tai­wan for pub­lic hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>It also came on the first day of a new quar­ter and of the sec­ond half of Ja­pan’s fis­cal year, when trad­ing vol­umes would typ­i­cally be high as many funds ad­just their po­si­tions. One of Ja­pan’s most closely watched eco­nomic in­di­ca­tors, the Bank of Ja­pan’s Tankan sur­vey, was also re­leased just 10 min­utes be­fore trad­ing was set to be­gin.</p>
    <p>The fail­ure was the first all-day stop­page of trad­ing since the ex­change shifted from the open-out­cry trad­ing pit to a fully-elec­tronic sys­tem in 1999. Pre­vi­ous sys­tem glitches had only af­fected part of the trad­ing day. The de­ci­sion to call off trad­ing was made af­ter con­fer­ring with mar­ket par­tic­i­pants, who said it would be dif­fi­cult to deal with their clients and carry out or­ders, the TSE said. All or­ders yes­ter­day were can­celled, and open­ing prices if trad­ing re­sumes to­day will be Wed­nes­day’s clos­ing prices.</p>
    <p>“This is very prob­lem­atic – when things like this hap­pen, in­vestor con­fi­dence in the Ja­pa­nese mar­ket gets im­pacted,” said Toyo Se­cu­ri­ties’ strate­gist Ryuta Ot­suka, adding: “It could later weigh on Ja­pa­nese stocks.”</p>
    <p>Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Kat­sunobu Kato, the top govern­ment spokesman, said it was “ex­tremely re­gret­table” that trad­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties have been re­stricted. The Fi­nan­cial Ser­vices Agency may or­der the ex­change to is­sue a re­port de­tail­ing the cause of the glitch and steps it will take to prevent a re­cur­rence, Ky­odo News re­ported.</p>
    <p>Global mar­kets are on a height­ened state of alert for any glitches af­ter a cy­ber at­tack in New Zealand that spurred trad­ing halts over four days in Au­gust, though Tokyo ex­change of­fi­cials said there were no in­di­ca­tions that yes­ter­day’s out­age was re­lated to hack­ing, which oc­curred on hard­ware not di­rectly con­nected ex­ter­nally.</p>
    <p>Deutsche Bourse’s elec­tron­ic­trad­ing sys­tem has also suf­fered two ma­jor out­ages this year.</p>
    <p>Other mar­kets in Ja­pan, in­clud­ing ex­changes in Sap­poro, Nagoya, and Fukuoka, also sus­pended trad­ing. Deriva­tives, in­clud­ing fu­tures, trade on the Osaka Ex­change, was not im­pacted by the sys­tem is­sue. Fu­tures con­tracts on the Nikkei 225 Stock Av­er­age closed 0.5 per cent higher in Osaka while Ja­pan Ex­change shares on the Ja­pan­next PTS plat­form ear­lier fell as much as 4.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Topix i ndex dropped 2 per cent on Wed­nes­day, trim­ming its gain for Septem­ber to 0.5 per cent and clos­ing the lat­est quar­ter with a 4.3 per cent ad­vance. A Tokyo-based eq­uity trader at a lo­cal bro­ker­age said mu­tual fund flows for the be­gin­ning of the month and sec­ond half of the fis­cal year will now be queued up.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s US$6.15 tril­lion (S$8.39 tril­lion) stock mar­ket is the third­largest in the world be­hind the US and China. There are 2,167 stocks listed on the top sec­tion of the Tokyo Stock Ex­change, where to­tal daily turnover has av­er­aged about US$22 bil­lion over the past year.</p>
    <p>An­a­lyst Makoto Sen­goku from Tokai Tokyo Re­search In­sti­tute said he will be watch­ing the re­ac­tion in the TSE Moth­ers In­dex, the main gauge for start-up com­pa­nies in Ja­pan. “For re­tail in­vestors that are trad­ing ev­ery day, to­day might be a shock, but for those who aren’t fre­quently trad­ing it’s not as im­pact­ful,” he said.</p>
    <p>A se­ries of com­puter is­sues in the mid-2000s led to the res­ig­na­tion of the ex­change pres­i­dent.</p>
