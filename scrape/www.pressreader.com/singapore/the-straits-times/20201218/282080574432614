    <p>Ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions can do more to cre­ate safe spa­ces for stu­dents who may face prob­lems seek­ing help for men­tal health is­sues, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a visit to Repub­lic Polytech­nic (RP) yes­ter­day, Madam Hal­imah noted that stu­dents may not have the courage to con­fide in their lec­tur­ers or teach­ers, or they may think there is a stigma re­lated to men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>“We need to pro­vide a safe en­vi­ron­ment for the stu­dents, for them to feel that it’s okay – ‘I have a men­tal health prob­lem, I can seek help and I will get the help and I will be able to con­tinue to per­form well’.”</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent spoke to the me­dia af­ter tour­ing RP’s Stu­dent Care Cen­tre, which caters to stu­dents with men­tal health is­sues as well as spe­cial ed­u­ca­tion and other needs.</p>
    <p>The 208 sq m cen­tre opened in June last year af­ter a re­vamp. It has two rooms for con­fer­ences, five for coun­selling, two sen­sory rooms and an as­sis­tive tech­nol­ogy li­brary, where stu­dents with spe­cial needs can bor­row as­sis­tive de­vices.</p>
    <p>The sen­sory rooms are pri­vate and quiet places for stu­dents who may be prone to anx­i­ety is­sues or panic at­tacks – a space for stu­dents to calm them­selves when they are feel­ing anx­ious in school.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah lauded RP for its ef­forts in pro­vid­ing sup­port for its stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Ms Sher Yuan, 18, a sec­ond-year stu­dent read­ing phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal sci­ence, said she fre­quently vis­its the cen­tre and makes use of the sen­sory rooms. She has autism spec­trum dis­or­der. “When I’m feel­ing stressed, I’ll go to the cen­tre to re­vise my home­work or have a quick chat with the coun­sel­lors,” she said, adding that the sen­sory rooms help her to calm down.</p>
    <p>The rooms are also equipped with a panic but­ton for stu­dents to alert a coun­sel­lor in times of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>The polytech­nic said that prior to the Covid-19 out­break, around 20 to 30 stu­dents vis­ited the cen­tre daily for a va­ri­ety of rea­sons – fi­nan­cial aid queries, coun­selling mat­ters, schol­ar­ships, stu­dent sup­port is­sues such as shut­tle bus ser­vices, as well as to bor­row as­sis­tive tech­nol­ogy equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah also vis­ited RP’s agri­cul­ture tech­nol­ogy lab­o­ra­tory dur­ing her visit. The lab, which uses tech­nol­ogy to op­ti­mise plant growth, is used mainly by stu­dents in RP’s School of Ap­plied Sci­ence and also hosts con­tin­u­ing ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing for adult learn­ers. It was launched in Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>Madam Hal­imah said: “This lab pro­vides a plat­form for stu­dents to gain real ex­pe­ri­ence in the needs of the agritech in­dus­try... RP is sup­port­ing our goal of ‘30 by 30’ and help­ing to grow the in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>The “30 by 30” goal is for Sin­ga­pore to pro­duce 30 per cent of its nu­tri­tional needs lo­cally by 2030.</p>
    <p>“This is re­ally the need of the fu­ture... The nor­mal way of grow­ing food is no longer go­ing to be very sus­tain­able in the long term, be­cause of the tremen­dous use of land, en­ergy and wa­ter,” she added.</p>
