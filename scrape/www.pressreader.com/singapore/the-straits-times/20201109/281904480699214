    <p>In the throes of the Demo­cratic pri­mary de­bates last year, Mr Joe Bi­den was at­tacked for his Se­nate his­tory of work­ing across the aisle with Repub­li­cans. He had be­friended racist for­mer seg­re­ga­tion­ists – and even at­tended their fu­ner­als, said his critic. His nos­tal­gic calls for bi­par­ti­san ci­vil­ity made him a relic of a by­gone era, she im­plied.</p>
    <p>The ri­val in ques­tion was Ms Ka­mala Har­ris, a com­peti­tor for the nom­i­na­tion, whom he went on to pick al­most a year later as his run­ning mate. Today, with the Bi­den-Har­ris ticket hav­ing won the 2020 election, that vine­gary clash is sud­denly rel­e­vant again.</p>
    <p>When Mr Bi­den is in­au­gu­rated on Jan 20, he would al­most cer­tainly have to grap­ple with a hos­tile Repub­li­can-con­trolled Se­nate. No­body was plan­ning on that.</p>
    <p>The fo­cus in the Demo­cratic de­bates was on the great plans the party would pur­sue after it had swept the Repub­li­cans out of town.</p>
    <p>“Among the large field of Demo­cratic con­tenders, Bi­den was iron­i­cally by far the best equipped to work with Repub­li­cans – the one qual­ity no­body saw as rel­e­vant,” says Mr Bill Gal­ston, a for­mer of­fi­cial in Mr Bill Clin­ton’s White House. “He was the only one cit­ing bi­par­ti­san­ship as a virtue.”</p>
    <p>The chances are that this par­tic­u­lar Bi­de­nesque qual­ity – in­deed, his trade­mark sell­ing point – will now be tested. It could take days, even weeks, be­fore the US pres­i­den­tial race is fi­nally set­tled – and there is not much hope that Mr Don­ald Trump will ever ut­ter the words “I con­cede”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is still claim­ing he has won the election. The chances that this could de­gen­er­ate into a nasty le­gal bat­tle in states Mr Bi­den has nar­rowly won can­not be ruled out.</p>
    <p>To say the least, Mr Trump is un­likely to be help­ful dur­ing the 10-week tran­si­tion be­tween now and inau­gu­ra­tion day. Peo­ple around him are even hint­ing that he might de­clare his can­di­dacy for the 2024 election, which would make him only the sec­ond United</p>
    <p>States pres­i­dent after Grover Cleve­land (in 1892) to lose the White House and run again.</p>
    <p>UN­DE­FEATED TRUMPIANS</p>
    <p>Even if Mr Trump goes qui­etly into the night, Mr Bi­den will have to deal with an army of un­de­feated Trumpians. Repub­li­cans have gained seats in the Demo­cratic-con­trolled House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives and very prob­a­bly re­tained con­trol of the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Roughly 48 per cent of the US elec­torate – or nearly 70 mil­lion – voted for Mr Trump in the largest turnout since 1900.</p>
    <p>Although Mr Bi­den won the most votes of any can­di­date in US his­tory, Mr Trump took the sec­ond-high­est to­tal.</p>
    <p>“We were ex­pect­ing a re­pu­di­a­tion of Trump­ism, not just a de­feat of Trump,” says Mr Brendan Boyle, a Demo­cratic con­gress­man from Penn­syl­va­nia. “Un­for­tu­nately, the mes­sage from the elec­torate was much more am­biva­lent than that.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den would be the first pres­i­dent to in­herit a di­vided govern­ment on tak­ing of­fice since Mr Ge­orge H. W. Bush in 1988. But the Democrats whom Mr Bush Se­nior was com­pelled to work with were a far more pli­able bunch than Mr Trump’s Repub­li­can Party.</p>
    <p>The most im­por­tant re­la­tion­ship in Washington would be be­tween Mr Bi­den and Mr Mitch McCon­nell, the Se­nate ma­jor­ity leader.</p>
    <p>Mr McCon­nell, whom lib­eral crit­ics dubbed “Moscow Mitch” be­cause of his un­wa­ver­ing sup­port for Mr Trump dur­ing last year’s im­peach­ment and beyond, spe­cialises in killing Demo­cratic plans.</p>
    <p>For six out of Mr Barack Obama’s eight years in the White House – after Democrats had lost con­trol of Congress in the Tea Party wave of 2010 – Mr McCon­nell blocked al­most ev­ery White House ini­tia­tive. His goal was to wreck the Obama pres­i­dency, even at the ex­pense of pass­ing Bills that would have been weighted to­wards Repub­li­can ends. He and Mr Obama were barely on speak­ing terms.</p>
    <p>When Mr Obama needed some­one to go to Capi­tol Hill to strike a deal, such as pre­vent­ing the US from de­fault­ing on its pub­lic debt, he would al­ways send Mr Bi­den. The Repub­li­can leader and for­mer vice-pres­i­dent have known each other since 1985.</p>
    <p>“If there is one Demo­crat who could work the field to get some Demo­cratic pri­or­i­ties through the Se­nate, it is Joe Bi­den,” says Mr Rahm Emanuel, who was Mr Obama’s White House chief of staff. “He knows that in­sti­tu­tion bet­ter than any­body in Washington.”</p>
    <p>CAB­I­NET PICKS</p>
    <p>But the sober­ing re­al­ity is that Mr McCon­nell would be un­likely to pass al­most any­thing of what Mr Bi­den wants. Nor would he be likely to con­firm peo­ple to top jobs who did not meet Repub­li­can ap­proval. That loom­ing prospect has al­ready put paid to spec­u­la­tion that Ms Su­san Rice, the for­mer na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser to Mr Obama, would be nom­i­nated as sec­re­tary of state. She is re­viled in con­ser­va­tive cir­cles.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, all talk of Ms El­iz­a­beth Warren, the Mas­sachusetts sen­a­tor, or an­other can­di­date from the left, as US Trea­sury sec­re­tary has been scotched. There is a say­ing in DC that “per­son­nel is pol­icy”. Mr Bi­den’s Cab­i­net will have to meet Mr McCon­nell’s ap­proval. The chances that he will nom­i­nate a Repub­li­can or two to top po­si­tions are thus high.</p>
    <p>The pro­gres­sive left, which now holds al­most as much weight in the Demo­cratic Party as the na­tion­al­ist-pop­ulists do on the right, is bound to be dis­ap­pointed.</p>
    <p>“Bi­den will have to say to them, ‘Look, I’d love to nom­i­nate X or Y to this or that po­si­tion, but McCon­nell won’t let me’,” says Mr Michael Beschloss, a lead­ing his­to­rian of the US pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>“Bi­den will have one hand tied be­hind his back from the start.”</p>
    <p>The im­pli­ca­tions for do­mes­tic pol­icy are dras­tic. It is still pos­si­ble Democrats could reach the magic thresh­old of 50 Se­nate seats if they win both run-offs – sec­ond-round elec­tions – for the two seats in Ge­or­gia on Jan 5. They are thus likely to be among the most con­tested Se­nate races in US elec­toral his­tory.</p>
    <p>“The dif­fer­ence be­tween 49 and 50 seats is the dif­fer­ence be­tween Mr Bi­den gov­ern­ing do­mes­ti­cally and not gov­ern­ing,” says a se­nior ad­viser to Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“The party will throw ev­ery­thing at those races.” But the chances they would win both are slim.</p>
    <p>An­other pos­si­bil­ity is that Democrats will try to per­suade one Repub­li­can to de­fect to their ranks by chang­ing par­ties.</p>
    <p>The like­li­est can­di­dates are Ms Su­san Collins, the re-elected sen­a­tor from Maine, and Ms Lisa Murkowski from Alaska. Or Mr Bi­den could of­fer Ms Collins a big Cab­i­net po­si­tion, which would en­able the Demo­cratic gov­er­nor of Maine to ap­point a Demo­cratic sen­a­tor in her place. The bar­gain­ing price of such out­liers has just shot through the roof.</p>
    <p>Again, how­ever, these are far-fetched prospects. “Any de­fec­tor would in­stantly be­come a cult hate fig­ure in the con­ser­va­tive move­ment,” says a Repub­li­can po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tant. “McCon­nell would make that steep price very clear to them.”</p>
    <p>Per­haps the best for which Democrats can hope for is a kind of Clin­ton-era tri­an­gu­la­tion in which Mr Bi­den man­ages to at­tach mod­est Demo­cratic pri­or­i­ties to big Repub­li­can Bills. Mr Clin­ton passed a dra­co­nian wel­fare re­form law, a three-strikes-and-you-are-out crime Bill, and em­braced fis­cal rec­ti­tude dur­ing the 1990s. His party’s left was rarely in­cluded in the con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The 1990s were forged in negotiatio­n be­tween Mr Clin­ton and Mr Newt Gin­grich, the fire­brand Repub­li­can Speaker.</p>
    <p>By the same to­ken, Mr Bernie San­ders, Ms Warren and Ms Alexan­dria Oca­sio-Cortez – the lead­ers on Capi­tol Hill of today’s</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic left – have sud­denly lost their lever­age. Their hopes of pass­ing a “green new deal”, a US$15 (S$20) fed­eral min­i­mum wage and higher taxes on the wealthy now look quixotic.</p>
    <p>The odds of a large fis­cal stim­u­lus that would in­clude Demo­cratic pri­or­i­ties, such as heavy aid for states and city gov­ern­ments to cope with the pan­demic, are also weak.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans have a his­tory of aban­don­ing fis­cal rec­ti­tude when one of their own is pres­i­dent – as hap­pened with Mr Trump’s US$1.5 tril­lion tax cut – only to re­dis­cover fis­cal reli­gion when there is a Demo­crat in the White House.</p>
    <p>HOW TO WIN OVER REPUB­LI­CANS</p>
    <p>This time is un­likely to be dif­fer­ent. One way Mr Bi­den could sell higher in­vest­ment spend­ing to Mr McCon­nell would be to avoid any talk of tax in­creases – a McCon­nell red line.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den could ar­gue that the US can now tap 30-year funds at 1 per cent in­ter­est that would eas­ily pay for them­selves.</p>
    <p>“This would be a mir­ror im­age of the Rea­gan-Bush “starve the beast” tax cuts where the re­sult­ing fis­cal deficits would even­tu­ally force Democrats to re­duce the size of govern­ment,” says Mr Lawrence Sum­mers, the for­mer US Trea­sury sec­re­tary for Mr Clin­ton. “If the US bor­rowed to in­vest and did it well, the in­vest­ment re­turns would grow the econ­omy and not lead to any kind of ex­plo­sive debt growth. If there was a rapid need for deficit ac­tion, the ad­just­ment would likely come on the tax side.”</p>
    <p>An­other way of sell­ing Demo­cratic pri­or­i­ties to Mr McCon­nell would be to frame them as a re­sponse to the threat of a ris­ing China. A num­ber of Repub­li­cans, such as Florida sen­a­tor Marco Ru­bio, talk of cre­at­ing a US in­dus­trial pol­icy on 5G and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to com­bat the spec­tre of an in­creas­ingly pow­er­ful China.</p>
    <p>“Se­nate Repub­li­cans must ask them­selves if the United States can af­ford two or four years of leg­isla­tive stag­na­tion if we are to com­pete with China,” says Mr Thomas Wright, a se­nior fel­low at Brook­ings In­sti­tu­tion. They could find com­mon ground “on in­dus­trial pol­icy, in­fra­struc­ture and many other ar­eas if they place com­pe­ti­tion with China at the heart of their agenda”.</p>
    <p>Should Mr Bi­den find him­self shack­led at home, he can al­ways spread his wings on the global stage. That might cut against his cam­paign’s “build back bet­ter” pri­or­ity of first re­pair­ing Amer­ica at home. But for­eign pol­icy would be where he has the most free­dom to ma­noeu­vre.</p>
    <p>“A US pres­i­dent can forge al­most any in­ter­na­tional agree­ment with­out re­gard to Congress as long as you don’t call it a treaty,” says Mr Richard Haas, pres­i­dent of the Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions in New York. “There are a lot more ar­eas of over­lap with Repub­li­cans on for­eign pol­icy than on do­mes­tic pol­icy. The idea that US diplo­macy should be amoral was pe­cu­liar to Trump.”</p>
    <p>Even here, how­ever, Mr Bi­den’s lat­i­tude is con­strained. He could re­join the Paris ac­cord on cli­mate change. But he can­not force a Repub­li­can Se­nate to fund al­ter­na­tive en­ergy. He could re­join the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, but he would need Mr McCon­nell to au­tho­rise US fund­ing for the body. He could bring Amer­ica back into the Iran nu­clear deal, but any changes would have to be ap­proved by the US Se­nate.</p>
    <p>VAL­UES-BASED DIPLO­MACY</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den would, how­ever, find some Repub­li­can sup­port for re­viv­ing what Washington still calls “val­ues-based diplo­macy” – the stress on democ­racy pro­mo­tion, hu­man rights and mul­ti­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion that Mr Trump so glee­fully aban­doned.</p>
    <p>“We have had a four-year val­ues hol­i­day in Amer­i­can diplo­macy,” says a se­nior ad­viser to Mr Bi­den. “Trump’s suck­ing up to au­to­crats like Vladimir Putin was some­thing that em­bar­rassed Se­nate Repub­li­cans, even though they mostly went along with it.”</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, how­ever, Mr Bi­den would be boxed in by the frus­trat­ingly equiv­o­cal out­come of last week’s elec­tions. Mr</p>
    <p>Trump may have lost. But Repub­li­cans as a whole gained na­tion­ally. There is lit­tle man­date for a pro­gres­sive agenda. Nor is there much prospect that Repub­li­cans will treat Mr Trump as an aber­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Al­most straight away, the US Se­nate will be­come the scene of jock­ey­ing for the 2024 nom­i­na­tion, in­clud­ing Mr Tom Cot­ton of Arkansas, Mr Ted Cruz of Texas and Mr Josh Haw­ley of Mis­souri. Mr Mike Pom­peo, the Sec­re­tary of State, is also in the fray. Each will at­tempt to claim the Trumpian man­tle. Mr Don­ald Trump Ju­nior or Ms Ivanka Trump may also throw their hats into the ring. The scope for old-fash­ioned Bi­de­nesque comity will be se­verely lim­ited.</p>
    <p>“We are now a party of the work­ing class,” Mr Haw­ley tweeted gid­dily on Tues­day night. What­ever that means in prac­tice, Mr Bi­den will find it hard to de­liver the na­tional unity on which he cam­paigned.</p>
    <p>It is dif­fi­cult to re­store a na­tional soul that ap­pears to be cleft in two. “You have to hope that Repub­li­cans can move on from Trump,” says Mr Boyle. “But that is a hope, not a strat­egy.”</p>
