    <p>Lo­cal dra­mas are a re­minder and doc­u­men­ta­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s evolv­ing his­tory and cul­ture through the years.</p>
    <p>They are avail­able on Mediacorp’s stream­ing plat­form meWatch, and Net­flix is adding more than 1,000 hours of Sin­ga­porean con­tent, from movies to beloved tele­vi­sion shows.</p>
    <p>With Na­tional Day just around the cor­ner, here are eight se­ries to re­visit to im­merse your­self in lo­cal sto­ries.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>THE AWAK­EN­ING (1984) Avail­able on meWatch</p>
    <p>The grand­daddy of lo­cal Chi­nese tele­vi­sion se­ri­als, The Awak­en­ing turned its stars Xiang Yun and the late Huang Weny­ong (both above) into house­hold names.</p>
    <p>The se­ries, set in colo­nial Sin­ga­pore in the 1920s, is about the ex­pe­ri­ences of Chi­nese im­mi­grants who crossed the seas to be­gin a new life here – the story of pi­o­neer-gen­er­a­tion Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>The drama’s con­tent – its his­tor­i­cal back­ground which fol­lowed Sin­ga­pore from colo­nial times to in­de­pen­dence – and its his­tor­i­cal sig­nif­i­cance as one of the ear­li­est Mediacorp hits make this per­fect for Na­tional Day view­ing.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>THE PRICE OF PEACE (1997)</p>
    <p>Avail­able on meWatch and from Satur­day on Net­flix</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese Oc­cu­pa­tion from 1942 to 1945 was a dark pe­riod in Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>The Price Of Peace was set dur­ing this tu­mul­tuous pe­riod and de­picted the sto­ries of war he­roes like Lim Bo Seng (played by Rayson Tan, above) – a prom­i­nent busi­ness­man turned re­sis­tance fighter who died dur­ing the war – and El­iz­a­beth Choy (played by Xiang Yun), who pro­vided help to pris­on­ers of war.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness­man Tan Kah Kee and Malayan Eurasian nurse Sy­bil Kathi­gasu ap­pear as char­ac­ters in the se­ries too.</p>
    <p>The drama also fea­tured rel­a­tively graphic rape and tor­ture scenes which are un­com­mon in lo­cal tele­vi­sion, serv­ing as a stark re­minder of the hard-earned price of peace.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>GROW­ING UP (1996 to 2001)</p>
    <p>Avail­able on meWatch and Sea­son 1 from Satur­day and Sea­sons 2 and 3 from Aug 30 on Net­flix</p>
    <p>The vin­tage fash­ion of the Tay fam­ily (above) is enough rea­son to tune in to the English-lan­guage clas­sic fam­ily drama.</p>
    <p>With six sea­sons from 1996 to 2001 un­der its belt, Grow­ing Up is one of the long­est-run­ning English drama se­ries in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mil­len­nial Sin­ga­pore­ans grew up with the cast and drama, which spanned the 1960s to the 1980s.</p>
    <p>Who can for­get Lim Kay Tong and Wee Soon Hui as Mr and Mrs Tay, An­drew Seow as the re­bel­lious Gary, Irin Gan as the wil­ful and fash­ion­able Vicky and Steven Lim as the smart David? And the young Tammy was played by ac­tress Fann Wong’s younger sis­ter Fann Woon Jing and ac­tress Quek Sue-shan be­fore the role went to Jamie Yeo.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>THE HO­TEL (2001)</p>
    <p>Avail­able on meWatch</p>
    <p>The 20-episode se­ries is a block­buster from broad­caster Mediacorp. It stars Ed­mund Chen and Chen Han­wei as well as Jace­lyn Tay and Ivy Lee – who have both since left the com­pany – as the staff of a fam­ily-run ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The set­ting is the per­fect ex­cuse for cameos from Mediacorp stars in ev­ery episode.</p>
    <p>Aside from veter­ans like Zoe Tay (above, left),</p>
    <p>Pan Lin­gling (above, right), Fann Wong, Li Nanx­ing and Tay Ping Hui, the likes of Cas­san­dra See, Florence Tan, Robin Leong, An­drew Seow, Wong Li Lin, Xie Shaoguang and An­drea De Cruz are other celebri­ties to look out for.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>TRUE FILES (2002 to 2007) Avail­able on meWatch</p>
    <p>Hosted for four sea­sons by Lim Kay Tong and later Tay Ping Hui for its fifth and fi­nal sea­son, True Files is a docu-drama which re-en­acts true and shock­ing Sin­ga­porean crimes based on court doc­u­ments. Cases it cov­ered in­clude the Adrian Lim cult killings, the trial of Sunny Ang and the Or­chard Tow­ers dou­ble mur­der.</p>
    <p>It has not aged well – scenes re-en­act­ing vi­o­lent deaths and chil­dren be­ing bru­talised seem ex­ploita­tive at times – but it has its place in lo­cal tele­vi­sion for its ex­plo­ration of the dark side of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>6</p>
    <p>C.L.I.F (2011 to 2019)</p>
    <p>Avail­able on meWatch</p>
    <p>C.L.I.F is a suc­cess­ful Chan­nel 8 pro­ce­dural which has spawned five se­ries. The cast has in­cluded names like Re­becca Lim, Rayson Tan (above, left), Tay Ping Hui (above, right), Joanne Peh, Elvin Ng and Qi Yuwu across the dif­fer­ent sea­sons.</p>
    <p>The ti­tle stands for Courage, Loy­alty, In­tegrity, Fair­ness and it is a drama made in col­lab­o­ra­tion with the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force.</p>
    <p>While it has plenty of fic­tional and ro­man­tic el­e­ments, the drama does show the day-to-day work­ings of the men and women in uni­form – from the Traf­fic Po­lice to the Po­lice Coast Guard – who help keep Sin­ga­pore safe.</p>
    <p>7</p>
    <p>BUNGA TAN­JONG (CAPE FLOWER, 2016)</p>
    <p>Avail­able on meWatch and from Satur­day on Net­flix</p>
    <p>This Suria se­ries ex­plores the lives of Malay women who worked as cabaret dancers in the 1950s and 1960s at a lo­cal dance club named Bunga Tan­jong.</p>
    <p>This was a real dance hall that op­er­ated in the 1950s at the renowned amuse­ment park New World Park in Jalan Be­sar, which closed in 1987. With hostesses dressed in colour­ful sarong ke­bayas, it could pack up to 500 peo­ple on a busy night.</p>
    <p>8</p>
    <p>THE UNBEATABLE­S (1993 to 2002)</p>
    <p>Avail­able on meWatch and from Aug 30 on Net­flix</p>
    <p>This is one of the rare lo­cal dra­mas that cen­tred on gam­bling.</p>
    <p>The lav­ish and glam­orous life­styles of the char­ac­ters – who swanned in and out of casi­nos in ex­pen­sive out­fits – re­flected a Sin­ga­pore tak­ing flight eco­nom­i­cally in the early 1990s.</p>
    <p>The se­ries also shows the im­pact that Hong Kong cin­ema had on lo­cal tele­vi­sion, as a slew of gam­bling-themed movies like God Of Gam­blers (1989) made waves across Asia at the time.</p>
