    <p>France and Ger­many are push­ing to tighten Euro­pean Union bor­ders to head off what French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron called the “threat of ter­ror­ism” af­ter sus­pected Is­lamist militants killed eight peo­ple in Paris, Nice and Vi­enna within a month.</p>
    <p>The at­tacks re­fo­cused the EU’s at­ten­tion on re­li­gious ex­trem­ism, which had fallen off the top of the po­lit­i­cal agenda af­ter a 2017 de­feat of the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria mil­i­tant group in the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>Un­der pres­sure to beef up se­cu­rity and re­as­sure vot­ers fol­low­ing the lat­est at­tacks, Mr Macron and Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel said Europe’s trou­bled 26-na­tion Schen­gen zone of con­trol-free travel over open bor­ders ur­gently needed fix­ing.</p>
    <p>The at­tacks in Nice and Vi­enna in­volved as­sailants who moved freely be­tween Schen­gen coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“The threat of ter­ror­ism weighs on all of Europe. We must re­spond,” Mr Macron said af­ter dis­cussing the mat­ter with Dr Merkel, Aus­trian Chan­cel­lor Se­bas­tian Kurz, Dutch Prime Min­is­ter Mark Rutte and top of­fi­cials in Brus­sels, the EU hub.</p>
    <p>“To re­form Schen­gen is to al­low free move­ment in se­cu­rity,” the French leader added.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel sided with Mr Macron in de­mand­ing stricter con­trols along the ex­ter­nal fron­tier of the Schen­gen area, which brings to­gether most EU mem­bers, as well as Ice­land, Nor­way, Switzer­land and Liecht­en­stein.</p>
    <p>“It is vi­tally nec­es­sary to know who comes in and who leaves the Schen­gen area,” she said.</p>
    <p>Na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns, chaotic mi­gra­tion into the EU from the Mid­dle East and Africa in re­cent years and, most re­cently, the coro­n­avirus pan­demic have led to the re-emer­gence of some bor­der con­trols in the Schen­gen zone – erod­ing what has been hailed as a mile­stone achieve­ment in Europe’s post-World War II in­te­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Kurz called for a more co­or­di­nated plan for deal­ing with for­eign militants while Mr Rutte em­pha­sised stop­ping “un­de­sir­able” for­eign fi­nanc­ing as a fur­ther av­enue to tackle ex­trem­ism.</p>
    <p>Other ideas in­clude im­pos­ing stricter de­mands on on­line plat­forms to com­bat ex­trem­ism, set­ting up a spe­cial Euro­pean in­sti­tute to train Mus­lim imams, and be­ing able to ef­fec­tively de­port peo­ple with no claim to asy­lum in Europe, as well as crim­i­nals and sus­pected ex­trem­ists.</p>
    <p>EU jus­tice and in­te­rior min­is­ters meet to­mor­row – the fifth an­niver­sary of co­or­di­nated at­tacks in Paris in which Is­lamist gun­men killed more than 130 peo­ple – to dis­cuss a joint se­cu­rity re­sponse to the lat­est in­ci­dents.</p>
    <p>Im­prov­ing the shar­ing of se­cu­rity data and beef­ing up the bloc’s bor­der force Fron­tex are also on the EU’s to-do list, ac­cord­ing to their draft de­ci­sion, which was seen by Reuters.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially for Mr Macron, the min­is­te­rial de­ci­sion in­cludes lan­guage re­in­forc­ing EU coun­tries’ rights to tem­po­rar­ily sus­pend free move­ment across Schen­gen bor­ders dur­ing se­cu­rity alerts.</p>
    <p>France has had such curbs on free move­ment in place since 2015.</p>
    <p>How­ever, many of the pro­pos­als now on the ta­ble have proven dif­fi­cult to get agree­ment, let alone im­ple­men­ta­tion, sug­gest­ing that the 27 na­tional EU lead­ers will have a hard nut to crack when they are due to de­cide on con­crete steps next month.</p>
