    <p>The French trans­la­tion of English writer Agatha Christie’s hit novel, And Then There Were None, will change its ti­tle to re­move a racially charged word al­ready dropped from the Bri­tish edi­tion decades ago, its edi­tor said late last month.</p>
    <p>The ti­tle Dix Petits Ne­gres, or Ten Lit­tle N*ggers, will be­come Ils Etaient Dix or They Were Ten.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to change the French ti­tle of one of the best­selling books by the “Queen of Crime” was made by her great­grand­son J ames Prichard, who heads the com­pany that owns the rights to Christie’s works.</p>
    <p>Mr Prichard told the broad­caster RTL that the book, first pub­lished in Bri­tain in 1939 un­der the ti­tle Ten Lit­tle N*ggers af­ter a min­strel song, dated back to a time when such lan­guage was com­mon.</p>
    <p>Not us­ing words “that up­set peo­ple”, Mr Prichard said, “just seems to me a very sen­si­ble po­si­tion to have in 2020”.</p>
    <p>Publisher Masque con­firmed to Agence France-Presse that the edit was made at the re­quest of the com­pany Agatha Christie Lim­ited “to align it with the English and Amer­i­can edi­tions and all other in­ter­na­tional trans­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>It stressed that “the story it­self has not changed”.</p>
    <p>The word “ne­gre” ap­peared 74 times in the French ver­sion of the book, first pub­lished in 1940.</p>
    <p>It will be re­placed with the word “sol­dat” or “sol­dier” in the lat­est trans­la­tion by Ger­ard de Cherge, ac­cord­ing to RTL.</p>
    <p>SOL­DIER IS­LAND</p>
    <p>The “Ile du Ne­gre”, where the mys­tery un­folds, be­comes the “Ile du Sol­dat”, sim­i­lar to the English ver­sion’s “Sol­dier Is­land”.</p>
    <p>The book gained its cur­rent English ti­tle in Bri­tain in the 1980s, fol­low­ing the ex­am­ple of the United States edi­tion, which came out as the non-of­fen­sive And Then There Were None from its first pub­li­ca­tion in 1940.</p>
    <p>It has also ap­peared un­der the ti­tle Ten Lit­tle In­di­ans – an­other racially loaded term.</p>
    <p>The book has sold more than 100 mil­lion copies, mak­ing it one of the best-selling nov­els of all time.</p>
    <p>France, which is in the midst of a de­bate about al­leged racism in the po­lice and so­ci­ety at large, was one of the last coun­tries to con­tinue us­ing the orig­i­nal ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to change it was not uni­ver­sally pop­u­lar, with France In­ter lit­er­ary pre­sen­ter Fran­cois Bus­nel calling it “ab­surd” and news­pa­per Le Fi­garo say­ing it was “an­other tri­umph for po­lit­i­cal cor­rect­ness”.</p>
    <p>The change came af­ter stream­ing plat­form HBO Max in June re­moved the film Gone With The Wind amid mass protests against racism and po­lice bru­tal­ity in the US.</p>
    <p>The mul­ti­ple Os­car-win­ning US Civil War epic re­leased in 1939 re­mains the high­est-gross­ing movie of all time, ad­justed for in­fla­tion, but its de­pic­tion of con­tented slaves and heroic slave­hold­ers has riled many.</p>
    <p>Eight years ago, the comic Tintin In The Congo caused a stir in France when publisher Louis De­las de­fended the book, which was writ­ten in 1931 and widely criticised as racist.</p>
