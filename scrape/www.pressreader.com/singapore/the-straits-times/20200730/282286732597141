    <p>A con­sul­ta­tion re­port has rec­om­mended that the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate (Si­bor) be dis­con­tin­ued in three to four years and that the Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Av­er­age (Sora) be used as the main in­ter­est rate bench­mark for Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed shift will sup­port the deep­en­ing of Sora mar­kets, re­sult­ing in more trans­par­ent loan­mar­ket pric­ing for bor­row­ers, and more ef­fi­cient risk man­age­ment for lenders, said the re­port, ti­tled Si­bor Re­form And The Fu­ture Land­scape Of SGD In­ter­est Rate Bench­marks.</p>
    <p>Once fi­nalised, this would mean that both Si­bor and the Swap Of­fer Rate (SOR) will be phased out and be re­placed by Sora.</p>
    <p>Si­bor, a polled rate by banks that con­trib­ute to the rate at which they could bor­row funds from one an­other, is com­monly used in home loans, com­mer­cial and syn­di­cated loans, trade fi­nanc­ing and work­ing­cap­i­tal fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>About a quar­ter of bor­row­ers on hous­ing loans are pegged to ei­ther the Si­bor or SOR, MAS data showed.</p>
    <p>The re­port by The As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore (ABS), the Sin­ga­pore For­eign Ex­change Mar­ket Com­mit­tee (SFEMC) and the Steer­ing Com­mit­tee for SOR Tran­si­tion to Sora (SC-STS) fol­lows the long-run­ning re­form of Si­bor, with the adop­tion of a new wa­ter­fall method­ol­ogy and tran­si­tion test­ing that was con­ducted from July 2019 to June 2020 to val­i­date it.</p>
    <p>Un­der this new method­ol­ogy, the un­der­ly­ing mar­ket for Si­bor was ex­panded be­yond the term un­se­cured in­ter­bank fund­ing mar­ket, to in­clude whole­sale fund­ing trans­ac­tions such as large cor­po­rate de­posits.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal ver­dict on the fate of Si­bor is likely to come in Novem­ber, fol­low­ing the end of the con­sul­ta­tion process.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Si­bor tran­si­tional test­ing car­ried out in the past year showed that while the re­sult­ing rate, termed the new polled bench­mark, was “rel­a­tively ro­bust”, it dis­played no­tice­able dif­fer­ences in volatil­ity and lev­els com­pared to Si­bor, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>The more volatile na­ture of the new polled bench­mark would make it more dif­fi­cult for end-user ac­cep­tance, and the dif­fer­ent char­ac­ter­is­tics will also mean that it can­not di­rectly re­place Si­bor in ex­ist­ing fi­nan­cial con­tracts.</p>
    <p>Com­pounded Sora rates, which are back­ward-look­ing overnight rates, are thought to of­fer more sta­bil­ity than for­ward-look­ing term rates com­monly used for float­ing home loan pack­ages in Sin­ga­pore, such as Si­bor. For­ward-look­ing term rates are more ex­posed to mar­ket fac­tors on a sin­gle day’s fix­ing, such as quar­ter or year-end volatil­ity.</p>
    <p>The re­port thus as­sessed that rather than tran­si­tion­ing Si­bor to a new polled bench­mark, it would be ben­e­fi­cial in the long run for SGD fi­nan­cial mar­kets to shift to a So­ra­cen­tred SGD in­ter­est rate mar­ket. This will avoid mar­ket frag­men­ta­tion, fa­cil­i­tate trans­parency and eas­ier com­par­i­son of loan pric­ing, and pro­mote the de­vel­op­ment of deep and ef­fi­cient SGD fi­nan­cial mar­kets, said the re­port.</p>
    <p>This comes as the in­dus­try is gear­ing up to tran­si­tion fully from SOR to Sora, which is the av­er­age rate of un­se­cured overnight in­ter­bank SGD trans­ac­tions bro­kered in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>SOR – the cur­rent bench­mark used to price de­riv­a­tives and busi­ness loans here – will be re­placed by the Sora, given the end of the scan­dal-tainted Li­bor af­ter end-2021, as the SOR uses USD Li­bor in its com­pu­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>To en­sure a smooth tran­si­tion for ex­ist­ing Si­bor users, the re­port pro­posed for the tran­si­tion to be done in a phased ap­proach. Tran­si­tion of con­tracts ref­er­enc­ing the more widely-used 1M and 3M Si­bor will take place af­ter the in­dus­try has sub­stan­tially com­pleted the tran­si­tion from SOR to Sora, which would es­sen­tially be in three to four years.</p>
    <p>Mr Samuel Tsien, ABS and SCSTS chair­man, noted in a state­ment that ma­jor fi­nan­cial cen­tres glob­ally will be mov­ing onto a risk-free rate (RFR)-cen­tred ap­proach or in­creas­ing the use of their RFRs.</p>
    <p>“The Sora-cen­tred ap­proach will bet­ter po­si­tion SGD fi­nan­cial mar­kets for the fu­ture,” he said. “It will al­low users of SGD float­ing rate prod­ucts, in­clud­ing re­tail con­sumers and SMEs (small and medium-sized en­ter­prises) with prod­ucts that ref­er­ence Si­bor to­day, to ben­e­fit from a deeper and more ef­fi­cient mar­ket, and greater trans­parency.”</p>
    <p>Ms Jac­que­line Loh, deputy man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, and an SC-STS mem­ber, said the shift to Sora is “an im­por­tant step for­ward by the in­dus­try that will en­hance liq­uid­ity and im­prove the over­all func­tion­ing of SGD in­ter­est rate mar­kets”.</p>
    <p>Si­bor, which tracks the US Fed’s rate move­ments, has fallen sharply since the Fed cut rates in March. As of yes­ter­day, 3M Si­bor stood at 0.438, down sharply from 1.627 per cent on March 3, be­fore the ear­lier Fed an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>The Sora-cen­tred ap­proach will bet­ter po­si­tion SGD fi­nan­cial mar­kets for the fu­ture... It will al­low users of SGD float­ing rate prod­ucts, in­clud­ing re­tail con­sumers and SMEs (small and medium-sized en­ter­prises) with prod­ucts that ref­er­ence Si­bor to­day, to ben­e­fit from a deeper and more ef­fi­cient mar­ket, and ’’ greater trans­parency.</p>
    <p>MR SAMUEL TSIEN, ABS AND SC-STS CHAIR­MAN, not­ing in a state­ment that ma­jor fi­nan­cial cen­tres glob­ally will be mov­ing onto a risk-free rate (RFR)-cen­tred ap­proach or in­creas­ing the use of their RFRs.</p>
