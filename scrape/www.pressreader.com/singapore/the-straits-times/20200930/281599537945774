    <p>Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan have ac­cused each other of firing di­rectly into the other’s ter­ri­tory amid the worst re­gional fight­ing since the 1990s. Dozens have been re­ported killed and hundreds wounded since clashes erupted in the moun­tain en­clave of Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday.</p>
    <p>BAKU/YERE­VAN • Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan ac­cused each other yesterday of firing di­rectly into each other’s ter­ri­tory beyond the Nagorno-Karabakh con­flict zone, as the worst re­gional fight­ing since the 1990s raged for a third day and civil­ian deaths mounted. Dozens have been re­ported killed and hundreds wounded since clashes be­tween Azer­bai­jan and its eth­nic Ar­me­nian moun­tain en­clave of Nagorno-Karabakh broke out on Sunday in a new erup­tion of a decades-old con­flict.</p>
    <p>In a sign that the fight­ing was spread­ing, Ar­me­nia’s For­eign Min­istry re­ported the first death in Ar­me­nia proper – a civil­ian it said was killed in an Az­eri at­tack in the town of Var­de­nis more than 20km from Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
    <p>The Ar­me­nian De­fence Min­istry said an Ar­me­nian civil­ian bus caught fire in the town after be­ing hit by an Az­eri drone. It was not clear if the re­ported civil­ian death was from that in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan’s Pres­i­dent Il­ham Aliyev said 10 civil­ians had been killed by Ar­me­nian shelling since Sunday. There was no of­fi­cial in­for­ma­tion about ca­su­al­ties among Az­eri ser­vice­men.</p>
    <p>Nagorno-Karabakh is a break­away re­gion in­side Azer­bai­jan that is run by eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans and sup­ported by Ar­me­nia. It broke away from Azer­bai­jan in a war in the 1990s, but is not recog­nised by any coun­try as an in­de­pen­dent re­pub­lic.</p>
    <p>An all-out war could drag in ma­jor re­gional pow­ers Rus­sia and Tur­key. Moscow has a de­fence al­liance with Ar­me­nia, which is the en­clave’s life­line to the out­side world, while Ankara backs its own eth­nic Tur­kic kin in Azer­bai­jan.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin said Moscow was in con­stant con­tact with Tur­key, Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan over the con­flict. Any talk of mil­i­tary sup­port for the op­pos­ing sides would only add fuel to the fire, it said.</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel called for an im­me­di­ate cease­fire and de-es­ca­la­tion in phone calls with the lead­ers of Azer­bai­jan and Ar­me­nia, govern­ment spokesman St­ef­fen Seib­ert said.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo also urged Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan to cease hos­til­i­ties, and called for the in­volve­ment of the Minsk Group – a body formed in the early 1990s to en­cour­age a res­o­lu­tion to the con­flict. It is co-chaired by France, Rus­sia and the US. France also wants Minsk Group talks.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia is con­sid­er­ing the pos­si­bil­ity of con­clud­ing a mil­i­tary-po­lit­i­cal al­liance with NagornoKar­abakh, Ms Lilit Makunts, an MP from the rul­ing My Step al­liance, wrote on her Face­book page.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan’s De­fence Min­istry said both sides had at­tempted to re­cover l ost ground by l aunch­ing counter-at­tacks in the di­rec­tions of Fizuli, Jabrayil, Agdere and Terter – Ar­me­nian-oc­cu­pied ar­eas of Azer­bai­jan that border Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia re­ported fight­ing through­out the night, and said Nagorno-Karabakh’s army had re­pelled at­tacks in sev­eral di­rec­tions along the line of con­tact.</p>
