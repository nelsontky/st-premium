6319-5488 stnewsdesk@sph.com.sg Business: Photo: Home: Sport: Art: that mask looks totally virus-proof! actually, it’s more for the neighbour’s second-hand smoke! Second-hand smoke in residentia­l areas has risen in recent months OnFacebook What if you need it overseas? You can’t show them your SingPass app. Should Singapore move towards the use of purely digital identifica­tion documents? Darren Pachai The NRIC is a very important document for Singapore citizens. It is proof of citizenshi­p and is used for many purposes. Digitalisa­tion of the NRIC is good and will help us all to move into the digital age. I would only ask that some personal data not be displayed on the NRIC, such as residentia­l address, but stored in a separate database. Digital identifica­tion is good for some normal services. But there is always the danger of the personal particular­s being hacked. The status quo is OK. In certain important cases, like CPF transactio­ns, it is better to show the hard copy of the NRIC. John Tang No. Many people born in the 1960s and 1970s will have problems coping with the new digital NRIC, causing too much problems. Chua Lee Kheng No, not only for security reasons, what about the Personal Data Protection Act? Andy Lim Kevin Loy Letters should be meant for exclusive publicatio­n in The Straits Times.
