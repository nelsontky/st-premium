    <p>Hous­ing Board flats that sold for at least $1 mil­lion made up 0.3 per cent of to­tal re­sale trans­ac­tions this year, said Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>There have been 38 such mil­lion­dol­lar flats sold as at Au­gust, out of 14,400 re­sale trans­ac­tions. Mr Lee gave the fig­ure in re­sponse to Mr Gan Thiam Poh (Ang Mo Kio GRC), who had asked how the Gov­ern­ment plans to as­suage public anx­i­ety and pent-up de­mand in re­la­tion to such mil­lion-dol­lar flats.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, flash es­ti­mates from real es­tate por­tal SRX showed that eight HDB re­sale flats were sold for at least $1 mil­lion last month. Of the eight units, the high­est trans­acted price was $1.26 mil­lion for a five-room flat at The Pin­na­cle@Dux­ton in Tan­jong Pa­gar.</p>
    <p>Sixty-four HDB flats were sold for more than $1 mil­lion last year, while 71 of such flats were sold in 2018.</p>
    <p>On the pric­ing of Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flats, Mr Lee said prices re­main at around five times the me­dian an­nual house­hold income, com­pared with that of other ma­jor cities in the world where the ra­tio can be nearly 10 or 20 times.</p>
    <p>When the HDB prices new flats, it first es­tab­lishes the flat’s mar­ket value by con­sid­er­ing fac­tors such as its at­tributes, the prices of com­pa­ra­ble re­sale flats nearby and pre­vail­ing mar­ket con­di­tions, he said.</p>
    <p>“A gen­er­ous sub­sidy is then ap­plied, so that new flats are priced at a sig­nif­i­cant dis­count to the mar­ket. The pric­ing ap­proach is the same for BTO flats in ma­ture and non-ma­ture estates,” he added.</p>
    <p>He noted that first-time flat buy­ers can also tap the En­hanced Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund Hous­ing Grant of up to $80,000. The ma­jor­ity of first-timer fam­i­lies are able to buy BTO flats in non-ma­ture estates and ser­vice their mort­gage in­stal­ments us­ing their CPF, pay­ing zero or min­i­mal cash, he added.</p>
    <p>He said the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to closely mon­i­tor the af­ford­abil­ity of BTO and re­sale flats.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Na­tional Devel­op­ment In­dra­nee Ra­jah told the House that about 80 per cent of the 1,000 two-room flexi flats launched in the first half of this year have been booked.</p>
    <p>Of these, more than 90 per cent were booked by se­niors and sin­gles, she said in re­sponse to Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>HDB launched an­other 1,800 two-room flexi flats in the Au­gust BTO sales ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>She added that on av­er­age, sin­gles bought about 6,000 re­sale flats out of the 22,000 sold each year over the past five years un­der the Sin­gle Sin­ga­pore Cit­i­zen Scheme or the Joint Sin­gles Scheme. Of these, about 46 per cent were three-room or smaller flats, 39 per cent were four-room flats, and 15 per cent were five-room or big­ger flats.</p>
