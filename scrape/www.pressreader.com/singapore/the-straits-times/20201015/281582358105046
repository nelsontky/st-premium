    <p>Three MPs have voiced con­cerns over whether Sin­ga­pore would be able to bal­ance the books for the cur­rent term of gov­ern­ment, as well as in the fu­ture, af­ter the Gov­ern­ment com­mit­ted nearly $100 bil­lion in Covid-19 sup­port mea­sures this year. They asked if the cur­rent draw to the tune of $52 bil­lion would need to be re­turned in full, among other things.</p>
    <p>Three MPs have voiced con­cerns over whether Sin­ga­pore would be able to bal­ance the books for the cur­rent term of gov­ern­ment, as well as in the fu­ture, af­ter the Gov­ern­ment com­mit­ted nearly $100 bil­lion to Covid-19 sup­port mea­sures this year.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a debate on the Gov­ern­ment’s strat­egy on Covid-19 in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, they asked if the cur­rent draw from the re­serves to the tune of $52 bil­lion would need to be re­turned in full, if fur­ther draws on the re­serves would be con­sid­ered, and the im­pact of the draw on the re­serves’ longer-term re­turns.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat had an­nounced in Au­gust that $8 bil­lion would be spent on mea­sures such as ex­tend­ing wage sub­si­dies for firms and a grant for Sin­ga­pore­ans who have been laid off. This comes on top of the nearly $100 bil­lion com­mit­ted un­der four Bud­gets this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng had said that the $8 bil­lion would be funded by the re­al­lo­ca­tion of monies from other ar­eas, such as devel­op­ment ex­pen­di­tures that were de­layed due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>There was no fur­ther draw on past re­serves be­yond the $52 bil­lion, for which Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob’s ap­proval was ob­tained ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang) noted that the net freed-up fund­ing amounts to $5.1 bil­lion, leav­ing a po­ten­tial deficit of about $2.9 bil­lion just a few months into the new term of gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The pic­ture also looks daunt­ing on the rev­enue front, he said, as the lat­est es­ti­mate projects a $12.3 bil­lion, or 16.1 per cent, drop in the Gov­ern­ment’s op­er­at­ing rev­enue.</p>
    <p>“Given the rev­enue out­look and the like­li­hood of fur­ther Covid-19 sup­port that is needed, how does (Mr Heng) en­vis­age we could bal­ance the Bud­get in the next two to three years?”</p>
    <p>Mr Liang asked if the Gov­ern­ment would con­sider a fur­ther draw on the re­serves, as some of these projects are nec­es­sary spend­ing as they are ca­pa­bil­ity in­vest­ments for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) sought clar­i­fi­ca­tion on the Net In­vest­ment Re­turns Con­tri­bu­tion (NIRC) – the re­turns on in­vest­ments of Sin­ga­pore’s re­serves – to the Gov­ern­ment’s re­vised rev­enue es­ti­mates. He asked how the NIRC es­ti­mate re­mained the same as it was in Fe­bru­ary – at $18.6 bil­lion – given the sub­stan­tial draw on re­serves to fight Covid-19, and how this was de­ter­mined.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua also said there is scope to re­think the coun­try’s po­si­tion on when to em­ploy gov­ern­ment debt, given the low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment. “In this lower-for-longer in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment, we should as a gov­ern­ment be open to ex­plor­ing such pos­si­bil­i­ties, in­stead of fund­ing our ex­pen­di­tures with higher-cost eq­uity fund­ing or fund­ing from our re­serves.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC) asked if Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies, would clar­ify if the $52 bil­lion drawn from Sin­ga­pore’s re­serves would be re­turned in full or in part.</p>
    <p>Mr Giam said restor­ing the amount in a short time could sub­ject Sin­ga­pore­ans to un­nec­es­sar­ily high lev­els of aus­ter­ity, which could slow eco­nomic growth and cause painful cuts to public ser­vices that might im­pact the poor.</p>
    <p>“Can the DPM as­sure Sin­ga­pore­ans that they would not have to go through a pe­riod of aus­ter­ity af­ter the eco­nomic cri­sis is over, in or­der to re­store the re­serves?”</p>
    <p>Mr Giam pointed out that dur­ing a Par­lia­ment debate in June, Mr Heng had said that there was no le­gal or con­sti­tu­tional obli­ga­tion for the Gov­ern­ment to re­store the draw on past re­serves, although he noted that Mr Heng had also said the Gov­ern­ment is com­mit­ted to do­ing so.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng had said then that the Gov­ern­ment had put back the $4 bil­lion drawn from the re­serves dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2009, but could not be de­fin­i­tive about how long the restora­tion for the cur­rent with­drawal would take.</p>
    <p>While Mr Giam ac­knowl­edged that the $52 bil­lion was nec­es­sary to pre­vent ex­ces­sive job losses and boost con­sumer spend­ing dur­ing the cri­sis, he urged greater con­sid­er­a­tion of the pos­si­ble bur­den that could be im­posed on the next gen­er­a­tion. “Given the Bud­get im­pact of po­ten­tial pro­vi­sions to re­store this ex­traor­di­nar­ily large amount to the re­serves, I feel it’s im­por­tant for the Gov­ern­ment to pro­vide more clar­ity about its broad time­line to do so.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng will round up the debate to­day.</p>
