    <p>Noise lev­els in my home have gone up dra­mat­i­cally and I blame my mother.</p>
    <p>Last Christ­mas, she showed up with a pret­tily wrapped box that bore no warn­ing about the din that was to be un­leashed, and which would un­ravel my quest to keep a some­what quiet home de­spite hav­ing two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>In the box was a Steeple­tone three-speed stand­alone record player – mean­ing it had built-in speak­ers – and with it, my mother had in­cluded a stack of 7-inch vinyl records.</p>
    <p>The records in­cluded Mother Goose rhymes, clas­sic sto­ries like Pinoc­chio and The Jun­gle Book – with lov­ingly il­lus­trated books to ac­com­pany the records.</p>
    <p>My chil­dren, with squeals of de­light, wasted no time in get­ting the player hooked up. That day, they lis­tened to their first au­dio­book.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter, my nine-year-old son got a set of Roald Dahl audiobooks on CD from my brother, and he has not looked back since.</p>
    <p>My daugh­ter, who is four and loves be­ing read to – but is still learn­ing to read on her own – hud­dles up to lis­ten to what­ever story her brother is lis­ten­ing to that day.</p>
    <p>My wife de­lights in be­ing able to pop in a record or CD for the kids and steal­ing away some quiet time for her­self.</p>
    <p>I, how­ever, had mixed feel­ings. My big­gest fear was that audiobooks would take the place of print books for my chil­dren and – based on the end­less hours my son spends lis­ten­ing to them – be­come yet an­other de­vice to covet.</p>
    <p>From the time both chil­dren were ba­bies, my wife and I have tried to in­cul­cate in them the read­ing habit.</p>
    <p>Start­ing when they were week-old in­fants, one of us would read a story to the kids for about 20 min­utes be­fore bed­time.</p>
    <p>My son now is an avid reader but audiobooks could undo all that, I felt.</p>
    <p>Turns out, I have lit­tle rea­son to worry.</p>
    <p>New re­search has shown that audiobooks can ben­e­fit chil­dren’s read­ing skills and en­joy­ment of books as well as their men­tal well-be­ing and emo­tional in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Lit­er­acy Trust, an in­de­pen­dent Bri­tish char­ity, found in an an­nual sur­vey that half of all chil­dren polled, or</p>
    <p>53 per cent, say lis­ten­ing to audiobooks has in­creased their in­ter­est in read­ing.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, which was con­ducted be­tween Jan­uary and March and in­volved 58,346 chil­dren and youth aged nine to 18, also found that two in five or 42.6 per cent of those polled say lis­ten­ing to audiobooks has made them more in­ter­ested in writ­ing.</p>
    <p>“Audiobooks also have sig­nif­i­cant ben­e­fits for chil­dren who are re­luc­tant or strug­gling read­ers. They give them ac­cess to sto­ries which they may not have been able to read in print,” the re­port added.</p>
    <p>It stands to rea­son that for chil­dren with learn­ing dif­fi­cul­ties, audiobooks are some­thing of a god­send.</p>
    <p>Not only can they open the win­dows to a lit­er­ary world that can be some­times dif­fi­cult to ac­cess, but they also help to colour a young child’s imag­i­na­tion with­out the strug­gles that of­ten come with the early stages of learn­ing to read.</p>
    <p>For those who have been able to gain an early foot­ing in read­ing, audiobooks are a com­ple­men­tary medium and pose no dan­ger, I be­lieve, in sup­plant­ing the love of print books.</p>
    <p>To be sure, as spell­bound as my son is lis­ten­ing to his Roald Dahl</p>
    <p>New re­search has shown that audiobooks can ben­e­fit chil­dren’s read­ing skills and en­joy­ment of books as well as their men­tal well-be­ing and emo­tional in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>CDs, he con­tin­ues to grav­i­tate towards his books reg­u­larly – when he isn’t try­ing to bam­boo­zle his mother into lend­ing him her mo­bile phone to watch foot­ball high­lights on YouTube.</p>
    <p>One thing is cer­tain – audiobooks are not only here to stay, but are also poised for a mas­sive boom.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm Deloitte, in a Deloitte In­sights re­port, fore­cast that the global au­dio­book mar­ket will grow by 25 per cent to US$3.5 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$4.8 bil­lion) this year.</p>
    <p>That means pub­lish­ing houses and re­tail­ers are likely to push out more books on the plat­form and widen the choices avail­able to read­ers young and old.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the Na­tional Li­brary Board (NLB) has kept pace with the grow­ing ap­petite of read­ers for e-books and audiobooks, which were a boon for my chil­dren dur­ing the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and the days af­ter.</p>
    <p>Libby, as the NLB app is called, is my son’s pre­ferred choice and it al­lows users to bor­row or down­load e-books and audiobooks.</p>
    <p>It has a wide choice of books avail­able, in­clud­ing in the mother tongue lan­guages.</p>
    <p>My son lis­tens mostly to audiobooks on foot­ball and books from Jeff Kin­ney’s Dairy Of A Wimpy Kid se­ries, which his snob­bish fa­ther re­fuses to buy for the home li­brary.</p>
    <p>We also know he dips into the Dog Man graphic novel se­ries, which has gar­nered some neg­a­tive re­views on­line, but my son does agree that while funny, the books are “weird”.</p>
    <p>And just like how I have be­come open to books not just in print but on other medi­ums too, I have be­come open to the idea of my chil­dren con­sum­ing nov­els, comic books and pop­u­lar books that may some­times be short on lit­er­ary merit.</p>
    <p>There is more than one way to de­velop a read­ing habit in to­day’s world, and my only hope is that the jour­ney con­tin­ues for lit­tle read­ers, and that their hori­zons con­tinue to broaden to in­clude bet­ter, more se­ri­ous books – print or oth­er­wise.</p>
