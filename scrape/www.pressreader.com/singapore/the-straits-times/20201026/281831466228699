    <p>The world will be watch­ing anx­iously over the next 10 days as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his chal­lenger Joe Bi­den duel over who will be­come the United States’ next leader.</p>
    <p>De­spite Mr Trump’s at­tempts to change his trail­ing cam­paign’s tra­jec­tory dur­ing the fi­nal de­bate last Thurs­day, CNN re­ported the next day that Mr Bi­den is still lead­ing na­tional polls by up to 10 per­cent­age points.</p>
    <p>A sep­a­rate poll for CNN of 585 vot­ers who watched the de­bate found that 53 per cent thought Mr Bi­den did the bet­ter job, while 39 per cent opted for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>The stakes for Asia re­main high, who­ever wins.</p>
    <p>Although in­ten­si­fy­ing US-China com­pe­ti­tion is in­evitable no mat­ter what the out­come is, how ten­sions will be tack­led un­der a Bi­den pres­i­dency may im­prove soured trade ties that have cost the global economy bil­lions of dol­lars, say ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Yet China may wel­come a sec­ond Trump term as his Amer­ica First poli­cies hand Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping the op­por­tu­nity to ce­ment his na­tion’s rise as a global su­per­power.</p>
    <p>The im­pli­ca­tions of the Nov 3 elec­tion for Asia will be ex­am­ined in a Zoom we­bi­nar on Wed­nes­day, which will be pre­sented by the East-West Cen­ter (EWC) in Honolulu and in Wash­ing­ton, in part­ner­ship with The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>It will fea­ture Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton Univer­sity’s Pro­fes­sor Robert Sut­ter and ST’s Wash­ing­ton-based US bureau chief Nir­mal Ghosh as well as other jour­nal­ists from Asia, with the ses­sion mod­er­ated by Dr Satu Li­maye, vice-pres­i­dent and di­rec­tor of the East-West Cen­ter in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>Prof Sut­ter teaches internatio­nal af­fairs at Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton Univer­sity and is co-au­thor of EWC’s US Asia Pol­icy And De­bate In The 2020 Elec­tions And Re­gional Re­sponse re­port, which as­sesses key is­sues in US re­gional re­la­tions and the con­cerns of re­gional al­lies.</p>
    <p>Mr Ghosh took up his as­sign­ment in Wash­ing­ton in 2016 and hosts the pa­per’s ST Asian In­sider video se­ries that show­cases an Asian per­spec­tive on global talk­ing points of the week.</p>
    <p>He noted that in some senses, the whole of hu­man­ity is a stake­holder in the idea of the United States of Amer­ica: “Now as the US bar­rels to­wards the most con­se­quen­tial elec­tion in its mod­ern his­tory, more is at stake than just its own fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“Who wins the White House will have ram­i­fi­ca­tions across the planet, but ar­guably nowhere more so than in Asia.”</p>
    <p>Dr Li­maye is the cre­ator and di­rec­tor of the Asia Mat­ters for Amer­ica ini­tia­tive that maps trade, in­vest­ment and diplo­macy con­nec­tions between the US and the Indo-Pa­cific through publi­ca­tions, data vi­su­al­i­sa­tions and other re­sources.</p>
    <p>The East-West Cen­ter is an in­de­pen­dent, non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that pro­motes bet­ter re­la­tions between the US, Asia and the Pa­cific through co­op­er­a­tive study, re­search and di­a­logue.</p>
    <p>The we­bi­nar is open to the public and will be held from 9am to 10.30am on Wed­nes­day. Reg­is­tra­tion is at https://str.sg/J6Ep</p>
