    <p>Malaysia’s pro­posal to re­move the sys­tems sup­plier and net­work op­er­a­tor of the high-speed rail (HSR) had led to the project’s ter­mi­na­tion, said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore could not ac­cept the re­moval of the As­sets Com­pany, which was nec­es­sary to en­sure the in­ter­ests of both coun­tries are pro­tected, he said.</p>
    <p>He also re­vealed that Sin­ga­pore has spent about $270 mil­lion on the HSR project so far.</p>
    <p>Be­cause nei­ther coun­try has the ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence in op­er­at­ing the HSR, we agreed un­der the HSR bi­lat­eral agree­ment to ap­point a best-in-class in­dus­try player through an open and trans­par­ent in­ter­na­tional ten­der to as­sume the role of the As­set­sCo... To Sin­ga­pore, As­set­sCo is the cen­tre­piece of the HSR project. It is nec­es­sary to en­sure that the in­ter­ests of both coun­tries are pro­tected. This will min­imise the pos­si­bil­ity of fu­ture dis­agree­ments and dis­putes over the long du­ra­tion of the project, last­ing decades.</p>
    <p>TRANS­PORT MIN­IS­TER ONG YE KUNG</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore could not ac­cept Malaysia’s pro­posal to re­move the sys­tems sup­plier and net­work op­er­a­tor of the high-speed rail (HSR) project as it con­sti­tuted a “fun­da­men­tal de­par­ture” from the orig­i­nal agree­ment, said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This “par­tic­u­larly sig­nif­i­cant change” to re­move the As­sets Com­pany (As­set­sCo) – which was nec­es­sary to pro­tect the in­ter­ests of both coun­tries – had led to the ter­mi­na­tion of the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore HSR project, he said.</p>
    <p>Malaysia had al­lowed the bi­lat­eral agree­ment to lapse on the dead­line of Dec 31 last year, af­ter both coun­tries could not agree to changes it had pro­posed.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Work­ers’ Party’s Mr Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) on the sub­stan­tive dif­fer­ences that both sides could not agree on, Mr Ong noted that the cross-bor­der HSR ser­vice, had it gone ahead, would have been a sin­gle train sys­tem op­er­at­ing be­tween Sin­ga­pore and KL.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause nei­ther coun­try has the ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence in op­er­at­ing the HSR, we agreed un­der the HSR bi­lat­eral agree­ment to ap­point a best-in-class in­dus­try player through an open and trans­par­ent in­ter­na­tional ten­der to as­sume the role of the As­set­sCo,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Once ap­pointed, the As­set­sCo will sup­ply the train sys­tem, op­er­ate the net­work, en­sure that ap­pro­pri­ate pri­or­ity is given to cross-bor­der HSR ser­vice vis-a-vis Malaysia’s do­mes­tic ser­vice, and be ac­count­able to both Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.”</p>
    <p>To Sin­ga­pore, the As­set­sCo is the “cen­tre­piece” of the HSR project and is nec­es­sary to en­sure that the in­ter­ests of both Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia are pro­tected, he added.</p>
    <p>“This will min­imise the pos­si­bil­ity of fu­ture dis­agree­ments and dis­putes over the long du­ra­tion of the project, last­ing decades,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore, there­fore, in­formed Malaysia that the re­moval of the As­set­sCo con­sti­tuted a fun­da­men­tal de­par­ture from the HSR bi­lat­eral agree­ment, and could not be ac­cepted.”</p>
    <p>With the project’s ter­mi­na­tion, Malaysia has to com­pen­sate Sin­ga­pore in ac­cor­dance with the HSR agree­ments, Mr Ong noted.</p>
    <p>He re­vealed that Sin­ga­pore has spent about $270 mil­lion on the HSR project to date.</p>
    <p>Asked by WP’s Mr Den­nis Tan (Hougang) for the rea­son­ing be­hind Malaysia’s change in po­si­tion on the As­set­sCo, Mr Ong said he could not speak for the Malaysian govern­ment.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas), Mr Ong said an­other pro­posed change by Malaysia – to con­nect the HSR to the Kuala Lumpur In­ter­na­tional Air­port (KLIA) – would have led to the high-speed line shar­ing tracks with an ex­ist­ing rail line to the air­port.</p>
    <p>“The Ex­press Rail Link is an ex­ist­ing train sys­tem model (that) runs at half the full speed of HSR, so should we have pro­ceeded, there would have been many tech­ni­cal is­sues to re­solve,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But hav­ing said that, the main con­cern for us was the re­moval of the As­set­sCo.”</p>
    <p>He noted that some me­dia reports had sug­gested Sin­ga­pore was con­cerned that the pro­posal to reroute the HSR to KLIA would im­pact its air hub.</p>
    <p>The is­sue has not been the key con­sid­er­a­tion dur­ing dis­cus­sions, he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the heavy air traf­fic be­tween the two ci­ties – which amounts to al­most five mil­lion pas­sen­gers a year – was why Sin­ga­pore be­lieved the HSR was “vi­able, mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial and strate­gic for the long term”.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries had inked the legally bind­ing bi­lat­eral agree­ment in 2016 af­ter three years of ne­go­ti­a­tions. At Malaysia’s re­quest, both sides signed a sup­ple­men­tal agree­ment in May 2018 to sus­pend con­struc­tion of the project.</p>
    <p>A sec­ond agree­ment was signed to ex­tend the sus­pen­sion to Dec 31, 2020, “with the ex­plicit un­der­stand­ing that it would be the fi­nal ex­ten­sion”, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>The $270 mil­lion spent on the HSR is lower than an ear­lier es­ti­mate of about $300 mil­lion pro­vided by pre­vi­ous trans­port min­is­ter Khaw Boon Wan in 2018, as Sin­ga­pore had man­aged to wind down con­tracts and main­tain ac­tiv­ity at a low level, he said.</p>
    <p>The com­pen­sa­tion to be paid by Malaysia will in­clude var­i­ous abortive costs such as for con­sul­tancy ser­vices, de­sign of in­fra­struc­ture, and man­power to de­liver the HSR project.</p>
    <p>It will not in­clude land ac­qui­si­tion costs, as the value of the land can be re­cov­ered, Mr Ong added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also ver­i­fy­ing a “small com­po­nent” of miscellane­ous abortive costs” for the sus­pen­sion of the project re­quested by Malaysia, he said.</p>
    <p>The amount and sched­ule of pay­ment is spec­i­fied in the agree­ments, Mr Ong said, adding that he could not dis­close the fig­ure due to con­fi­den­tial­ity rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Depart­ment Mustapa Mo­hamed has said that Malaysia will hon­our its obli­ga­tions, and both coun­tries will ini­ti­ate the nec­es­sary pro­ce­dures to de­ter­mine the amount of com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Malaysia had in 2019 re­mit­ted $15 mil­lion to Sin­ga­pore as pay­ment for abortive costs the Repub­lic in­curred as a re­sult of the ini­tial sus­pen­sion of the HSR project. This amount cov­ered costs linked to the sus­pen­sion, such as con­tract break­age and man­power, and is not part of the com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Mr Sak­tiandi Su­paat (Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC), Mr Ong said Sin­ga­pore re­mains will­ing to dis­cuss any new pro­posal on the KL-Sin­ga­pore HSR or sim­i­lar projects in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“Whether we are open to fu­ture dis­cus­sions – of course, we are. But it should be on a clean slate af­ter we set­tle the cur­rent HSR bi­lat­eral agree­ment,” he said.</p>
