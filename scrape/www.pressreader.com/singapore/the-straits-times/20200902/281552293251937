    <p>A se­nior In­dian of­fi­cial said that In­dian troops were de­ployed on four strate­gic hill­tops af­ter what New Delhi called an at­tempted Chi­nese in­cur­sion along the dis­puted bor­der, un­der­lin­ing ten­sions be­tween the Asian gi­ants.</p>
    <p>NEW DELHI • A se­nior In­dian of­fi­cial said yes­ter­day that In­dian troops had been de­ployed on four strate­gic hill­tops af­ter what New Delhi called an at­tempted Chi­nese in­cur­sion along the dis­puted Hi­malayan bor­der, un­der­lin­ing sim­mer­ing ten­sions be­tween the Asian gi­ants.</p>
    <p>But China de­nied that it had moved first, with Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing yes­ter­day say­ing In­dian troops had tres­passed across the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol (LAC) – the de facto bor­der – on Mon­day, con­duct­ing “fla­grant provo­ca­tions”.</p>
    <p>In­dian and Chi­nese troops have been locked in a high-al­ti­tude bor­der con­fronta­tion for months in the western Hi­malayan re­gion of Ladakh. The two sides have dis­puted the course of the fron­tier for more than half a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>The In­dian of­fi­cial, who was briefed on the lat­est in­ci­dent, said the In­dian troop move­ment was in re­sponse to an at­tempt by a large num­ber of Chi­nese in­fantry to push through a key moun­tain pass late last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>“We mo­bilised and oc­cu­pied the four heights,” the of­fi­cial said, adding that all four hill­tops were on In­dia’s side of the LAC.</p>
    <p>The In­dian of­fi­cial said the Chi­nese sol­diers were sup­ported by mil­i­tary ve­hi­cles and drew close enough to en­gage In­dian troops in ver­bal ar­gu­ments, but there were no clashes.</p>
    <p>He said the in­ci­dent oc­curred on the south­ern bank of Pan­gong Tso, a pic­turesque l ake in the snow desert re­gion where In­dian and Chi­nese troops have been fac­ing off since April.</p>
    <p>The In­dian of­fi­cial said the Chi­nese had been con­sol­i­dat­ing po­si­tions on the north­ern bank of the lake with what ap­peared to be new de­fen­sive po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Anurag Srivastava, a spokesman for In­dia’s Min­istry of Ex­ter­nal Af­fairs, yes­ter­day said the Chi­nese troops en­gaged in provoca­tive ac­tion on Satur­day and Sun­day nights, and again on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“We... have urged them to dis­ci­pline and con­trol their front­line troops from un­der­tak­ing such provoca­tive ac­tions,” he said, re­fer­ring to the Chi­nese side.</p>
    <p>Ms Hua said at yes­ter­day’s reg­u­lar press brief­ing in Bei­jing: “Chi­nese bor­der troops have al­ways acted in strict com­pli­ance with the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol, and have never crossed the line for any ac­tiv­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>“China has made solemn rep­re­sen­ta­tions to the In­dian side, de­mand­ing that the In­dian side stop all provoca­tive ac­tions and im­me­di­ately with­draw those who have crossed the line il­le­gally,” she said.</p>
    <p>“In­dia... said it pre-empted Chi­nese mil­i­tary ac­tiv­ity,” China’s state-backed Global Times said in an ed­i­to­rial yes­ter­day. “The word ‘pre-empt’ shows it was In­dian troops that first took de­struc­tive ac­tion, and the In­dian troops ini­ti­ated the stand-off this time.”</p>
    <p>“If In­dia would like a mil­i­tary show­down, the PLA (Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army) is bound to make the In­dian army suf­fer much more se­vere losses than it did in 1962,” it added, re­fer­ring to the bor­der war in 1962.</p>
    <p>In June, 20 In­dian sol­diers were killed in hand-to-hand com­bat with Chi­nese troops in Ladakh’s Gal­wan area.</p>
    <p>MO­BILISED TROOPS We mo­bilised and oc­cu­pied the four heights.</p>

    <p>NEVER CROSSED THE LINE Chi­nese bor­der troops have... never crossed the line for any ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>MS HUA CHUN­Y­ING, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman, said China’s troops have “al­ways acted in strict com­pli­ance with the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol”.</p>
