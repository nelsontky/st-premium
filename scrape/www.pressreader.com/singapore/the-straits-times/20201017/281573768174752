    <p>Clas­sic Dis­ney an­i­mated movies Peter Pan, The Aris­to­cats and Dumbo have been given con­tent ad­vi­sory no­tices warn­ing view­ers that the films con­tain out­dated or stereo­typed de­pic­tions of peo­ple of colour. The ad­vi­sories come in the form of a short graphic on Dis­ney+ as some of the older films are se­lected for view­ing.</p>
    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Clas­sic Dis­ney an­i­mated movies Peter Pan (1953), The Aris­to­cats (1970) and Dumbo (1941) have been given con­tent ad­vi­sory no­tices warn­ing view­ers that they con­tain out­dated or stereo­typed de­pic­tions of peo­ple of colour.</p>
    <p>The ad­vi­sories, the lat­est ex­am­ple of Hol­ly­wood’s reck­on­ing with racism, come in the form of a short graphic on the Dis­ney+ stream­ing ser­vice as some of the older films are se­lected for view­ing.</p>
    <p>“This pro­gramme in­cludes neg­a­tive de­pic­tions and/or mis­treat­ment of peo­ple or cul­tures,” the on­screen ad­vice reads.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese stereo­types were wrong then and are wrong now. Rather than re­move this con­tent, we want to ac­knowl­edge its harm­ful im­pact, learn from it and spark con­ver­sa­tion to cre­ate a more in­clu­sive fu­ture to­gether,” it adds.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney said on its web­site that the ad­vi­sories were part of a re­view of its li­brary con­tent.</p>
    <p>The movie stu­dio said that the film Peter Pan refers to na­tive peo­ple as “red­skins” and that the danc­ing in head­dresses by Peter and the Lost Boys is a “form of mock­ery and ap­pro­pri­a­tion of na­tive peo­ple’s cul­ture and im­agery”.</p>
    <p>For The Aris­to­cats, the ad­vi­sory refers to one of the fe­lines, not­ing that it “sings in poorly ac­cented</p>
    <p>English voiced by a white ac­tor and plays the pi­ano with chop­sticks”.</p>
    <p>Other movies dat­ing back to the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s with the new warn­ing in­clude The Lady And The Tramp (1955), Swiss Fam­ily Robin­son (1960) and The Jun­gle Book (1967).</p>
    <p>In June, amid mas­sive na­tion­wide protests in the United States over po­lice bru­tal­ity and racial in­jus­tice, the US Civil War-era film Gone With The Wind (1939) was briefly pulled from the HBO Max stream­ing ser­vice.</p>
    <p>It reap­peared two weeks later with a com­men­tary about the bru­tal­ity of slav­ery.</p>
