    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong air travel bub­ble will be an im­por­tant test that will de­ter­mine if sim­i­lar ar­range­ments for leisure travel can be made with other gov­ern­ments.</p>
    <p>Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said: “We need to per­suade our part­ners... that it is pos­si­ble to stay safe and yet open.”</p>
    <p>If Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong can demon­strate this, “then I think we will open up more minds and open up more air bub­bles”, he added.</p>
    <p>An­nounced two weeks ago, the bi­lat­eral air travel bub­ble which is set to take off next month will al­low travel with­out the need for quar­an­tine, stay-home-no­tice re­quire­ments or a con­trolled itinerary.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers will be re­quired to have been in ei­ther Hong Kong or Sin­ga­pore for a 14-day pe­riod be­fore they make the jour­ney, and will also need to take mu­tu­ally recog­nised Covid-19 swab tests and pro­duce a neg­a­tive re­sult.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong would not be drawn into say­ing how many peo­ple will be al­lowed to travel, but said the quota may be in­creased as op­er­a­tions sta­bilise.</p>
    <p>“We are ap­proach­ing it in a very prac­ti­cal, very cau­tious man­ner to make sure that we are open­ing up safely,” the min­is­ter said.</p>
    <p>On whether Sin­ga­pore­ans can ex­pect even more air travel bub­bles in the fu­ture, Mr Ong said he was cau­tious about rais­ing ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>“We have spo­ken to many part­ners... and peo­ple are think­ing about it,” he said.</p>
    <p>Much de­pends on the level of con­fi­dence that peo­ple in the var­i­ous coun­tries have.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said: “We are not just talk­ing gov­ern­ment to gov­ern­ment, or civil avi­a­tion au­thor­i­ties talk­ing to each other. We also need to take care of the sen­ti­ments and com­pe­tence level of our own peo­ple... So, this is what is chal­leng­ing about the whole process.”</p>
    <p>On whether there are plans for more travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, Mr Ong said: “I would re­ally like to have an air bub­ble with Malaysia.</p>
    <p>“But as of now, the case num­bers in Malaysia are quite high, so I think we will have to wait and see... We do know and our health­care of­fi­cials’ assess­ment is that Malaysia takes the virus con­trol very se­ri­ously. So, I cer­tainly hope they will suc­ceed in sup­press­ing this cur­rent round of spikes.”</p>
    <p>He added: “When the time is right, I am sure I will pro­pose (an air travel bub­ble) to them.”</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, Sin­ga­pore­ans should tem­per their ex­pec­ta­tions about leisure travel.</p>
    <p>Said the min­is­ter, who is plan­ning a stay­ca­tion soon: “We have to be pa­tient.... I wasn’t plan­ning to go any­where in De­cem­ber, nei­ther am I able to go any­where. I guess we just have to spend more time dis­cov­er­ing Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>On whether there are plans for more travel be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, Mr Ong said: “I would re­ally like to have an air bub­ble with Malaysia. But as of now, the case num­bers in Malaysia are quite high, so I think we will have to wait and see.”</p>
