    <p>A di­rec­tor of three com­pa­nies who un­law­fully sup­plied lux­ury goods worth nearly $580,000 to North Korea was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to three weeks’ jail.</p>
    <p>The items in­cluded per­fumes, cos­met­ics and watches clad with a pre­cious metal, as de­scribed in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Chong Hock Yen was the sole de­ci­sion-maker and head of three lo­cally based firms: SCN Sin­ga­pore, Sin­dok Trad­ing – now known as BSS Global – and Lau­rich In­ter­na­tional, which has been re­named Gun­nar Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The 60-year-old Sin­ga­porean had pleaded guilty last month to eight counts of en­gag­ing in a con­spir­acy to sup­ply lux­ury items worth nearly $270,000 to North Korea.</p>
    <p>An­other 35 sim­i­lar charges for the re­main­ing items were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The three firms also ad­mit­ted to sim­i­lar of­fences last month.</p>
    <p>SCN pleaded guilty to six charges in­volv­ing lux­ury goods worth more than $220,000, while Sin­dok and Lau­rich ad­mit­ted to one charge each. Sin­dok’s charge in­volved lux­ury goods worth more than US$10,000 (S$13,500) and Lau­rich’s case was for goods worth US$12,000. SCN was yes­ter­day fined $120,000, while Sin­dok and Lau­rich were each fined $10,000.</p>
    <p>The court heard that due to United Na­tions sanc­tions, it is il­le­gal for any­one in Sin­ga­pore to sup­ply, sell or trans­fer des­ig­nated lux­ury items to North Korean en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>It also heard that the com­pa­nies sup­plied lux­ury items to four en­ti­ties in North Korea from De­cem­ber 2010 to Novem­ber 2016 – Bugsae Shop, Korea Jangsaeng Trad­ing Cor­po­ra­tion (Py­ongyang), MG Cor­po­ra­tion and New Hope Joint Ven­ture Cor­po­ra­tion (Py­ongyang).</p>
    <p>SCN had sup­plied the bulk of the goods to Bugsae Shop, which is owned by North Korean Li Ik.</p>
    <p>His son, Li Hyon, had stud­ied in Sin­ga­pore be­fore help­ing his fa­ther with the lux­ury goods busi­ness while be­ing based here.</p>
    <p>The goods were sent to North Korea in three dif­fer­ent ways: by air and sea through China, and by hand through air­port check-ins.</p>
    <p>Chong was aware that such trans­ac­tions were in breach of the law.</p>
    <p>On Sept 25, 2017, Sin­ga­pore’s Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment re­ceived in­for­ma­tion that SCN had “sig­nif­i­cant sales to more than one en­tity” in North Korea.</p>
    <p>Li Hyon was jailed for four weeks ear­lier this year af­ter plead­ing guilty to four counts of en­gag­ing in a con­spir­acy with other peo­ple and two com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing SCN, to de­liver lux­ury goods such as cos­met­ics and spir­its to North Korea.</p>
