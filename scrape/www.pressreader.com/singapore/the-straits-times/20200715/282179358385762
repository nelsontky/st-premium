    <p>Two free­hold cor­ner shophouses in the Laven­der/Kal­lang area are up for sale with a guide price of $13.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty at 52 Foch Road com­prises a pair of two-storey con­ser­va­tion shophouses with at­tic, with a four-storey rear ex­ten­sion. They sit on a free­hold site of 2,848 sq ft and have a built-up area of about 8,417 sq ft.</p>
    <p>It is zoned “com­mer­cial” un­der the Jalan Be­sar Sec­ondary Set­tle­ment Con­ser­va­tion Area, which al­lows for rear ex­ten­sion of up to six storeys.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket­ing agent Sav­ills Sin­ga­pore said yes­ter­day that the prop­erty is at the start of Foch Road and Laven­der Street and boasts “high vis­i­bil­ity”, with about 18m of “prom­i­nent” main road frontage along Jalan Be­sar.</p>
    <p>It “en­joys high foot­fall through­out the day” and is op­po­site the re­cently com­pleted Arc 380, a mixed-use com­mer­cial de­vel­op­ment, it added.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty has “restau­rant” ap­proval on the ground floor and is rented to a cof­fee shop op­er­a­tor. Of­fice ten­ants are on the up­per floors.</p>
    <p>It has con­crete stair­cases and floor­ing and a mod­ern lift. All seven units come with en suite toi­lets and in­di­vid­ual air-con­di­tion­ing sys­tems, while se­lected units on the up­per floors en­joy dou­ble vol­ume ceil­ing height.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty could i nclude a cafe, a fit­ness cen­tre and a show­room as well as ed­u­ca­tional, re­tail, health­care, med­i­cal, home and liv­ing, and life­style busi­nesses, Sav­ills Sin­ga­pore said.</p>
    <p>Ms Sophia Lim, its se­nior man­ager of in­vest­ment sales and cap­i­tal mar­kets, said a buyer will have “the flex­i­bil­ity to con­fig­ure the space to suit an en­tire spec­trum of com­mer­cial uses”.</p>
    <p>“This is a rare op­por­tu­nity for both in­vestors and end users to own a pair of free­hold com­mer­cial shophouses that come with both F&B (food and bev­er­age) ap­provals and mod­ern specificat­ions (in­clud­ing a lift) in the heart of the Laven­der/Kal­lang precinct,” she added.</p>
    <p>The shophouses are 270m from Ben­de­meer MRT sta­tion and an eight-minute drive from the Cen­tral Busi­ness District. Ape­ria Mall and CT Hub are nearby.</p>
    <p>Sav­ills Sin­ga­pore said the area has seen “vi­brant trans­for­ma­tion” in re­cent years, with the in­tro­duc­tion of high-rise res­i­den­tial and largescale com­mer­cial de­vel­op­ments of­fer­ing en­ter­tain­ment, cul­tural and life­style at­trac­tions, re­sult­ing in “ex­tremely high foot­fall”.</p>
    <p>It added that the area will con­tinue to ben­e­fit from new de­vel­op­ments such as up­com­ing mixed projects Sturdee Res­i­dences and 2 and 21 Ca­van Road.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said city fringe lo­ca­tions like Laven­der have be­come pop­u­lar among in­vestors due to their rental up­side and po­ten­tial for cap­i­tal gains, with cor­ner shophouses of par­tic­u­lar in­ter­est, given their high vis­i­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>There will be no ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty or seller’s stamp duty for the prop­erty and for­eign­ers and com­pa­nies can buy it .</p>
    <p>Ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est will close at 3pm on Aug 17.</p>
