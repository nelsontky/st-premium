    <p>Michael Bay’s pan­demic thriller, Song­bird, has a sound­scape fea­tur­ing mu­si­cians from about 15 coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Jonathan Ngeow, 31, and Calista Liaw, 20, are among 25 in­ter­na­tional mu­si­cians who recorded them­selves re­motely and worked with ac­claimed com­poser Lorne Balfe to cre­ate a pan­demic sound­scape.</p>
    <p>Song­bird, the first fea­ture film to be shot in Los An­ge­les since the Covid-19 lock­down in the United States, is a ro­man­tic thriller set four years in the fu­ture as Covid-23, a mu­tated ver­sion of the virus, con­tin­ues to rav­age the world. It is pro­duced by Bay and di­rected by Adam Ma­son.</p>
    <p>Ngeow plays the ruan and Liaw the erhu, both tra­di­tional Chi­nese string in­stru­ments.</p>
    <p>They were in­vited to be part of the sound­track af­ter an Amer­i­can mu­sic pro­duc­tion com­pany spot­ted them on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Ngeow is a mem­ber of the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Or­ches­tra, while Liaw is a first-year bach­e­lor of mu­sic stu­dent at the Yong Siew Toh Con­ser­va­tory of Mu­sic, study­ing mu­sic and so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>They were given the film score and a back­ing track and recorded them­selves re­motely – Ngeow at home and Liaw at her univer­sity with the help of a pro­fes­sor. Their record­ings, along with those by mu­si­cians else­where in the world, were later wo­ven into the film.</p>
    <p>Ngeow says they found out the project was a film only dur­ing a Skype meet­ing with Mis­sion: Im­pos­si­ble com­poser Balfe.</p>
    <p>“When they told me it was for a movie, I was even more ex­cited... I grew up watch­ing Michael Bay movies – the ac­tion movies, Trans­form­ers and so on,” says Ngeow, who is also one of 16 mu­si­cians from Sin­ga­pore’s Ding Yi Mu­sic Com­pany who recorded mu­sic used in Dis­ney’s Mu­lan ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Liaw adds: “I was stunned. I would never have thought I would one day get to be part of the record­ing for a Hol­ly­wood film with­out be­ing ac­tu­ally there.”</p>
    <p>Bay is known for big-bud­get ac­tion films such as Ar­maged­don (1998) and the Trans­form­ers se­ries (2007 to present).</p>
    <p>Song­bird, which stars KJ Apa, Sofia Car­son, Craig Robin­son and Bradley Whit­ford, has drawn con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>In July, the Screen Ac­tors Guild – Amer­i­can Fed­er­a­tion of Tele­vi­sion and Ra­dio Artists told its mem­bers not to work on Song­bird, with a spokesman say­ing the film’s pro­duc­ers had not been trans­par­ent about their safety pro­to­cols. The labour union, how­ever, re­scinded its “do not work” or­der shortly af­ter.</p>
    <p>The film was re­leased on pre­mium video-on-de­mand plat­forms this month to mixed re­views.</p>
    <p>I would never have thought I would one day get to be part of the record­ing for a Hol­ly­wood film with­out ac­tu­ally be­ing there... Covid-19 has shifted the pos­si­bil­i­ties – this opens up op­por­tu­ni­ties for mu­si­cians world­wide.</p>
    <p>Some ac­cused it of be­ing in­sen­si­tive and of cap­i­tal­is­ing on the on­go­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But Liaw hopes peo­ple will watch the film with an open mind.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing the prac­tice of record­ing mu­sic re­motely, she says: “In the past, for film mu­sic, mu­si­cians would go down to the stu­dio to do the record­ing.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has shifted the pos­si­bil­i­ties – this opens up op­por­tu­ni­ties for mu­si­cians world­wide.”</p>
    <p>CALISTA LIAW, on how the prac­tice of record­ing mu­sic re­motely has been gain­ing trac­tion as a re­sult of the pan­demic and safety mea­sures</p>
