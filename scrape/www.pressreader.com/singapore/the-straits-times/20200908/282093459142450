    <p>If neck gaiters should not be used as masks, then should sin­gle-layer cot­ton masks be al­lowed?</p>
    <p>How many lay­ers there are is of no use. Some leave the nose out­side of the mask. Some also re­move their masks when they cough or sneeze. Im­proper use of masks will still be a prob­lem. Jerry Heng</p>
    <p>Masks are sup­posed to be used with fil­ters but many peo­ple don’t use them. Some three-ply cot­ton masks might be worn out and the fil­ter al­ready gone but peo­ple don’t even re­alise it.</p>
    <p>MG Ng</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic drag­ging on, the fear of catch­ing the coro­n­avirus is no longer present in most peo­ple. Com­pla­cency sets in and peo­ple wear masks only for show.</p>
    <p>As long as there is a cover over the mouth and nose, it’s enough. At the end of the day, it is about stopping or ab­sorb­ing any saliva droplets.</p>
    <p>Wilkie Ong Keng Soon</p>
    <p>Sin­gle-layer cot­ton masks do not of­fer good pro­tec­tion from viruses. It is not about what is al­lowed or not al­lowed. Be sen­si­ble and take care of your own health. Masks are not some dec­o­ra­tion or ac­ces­sory.</p>
    <p>Gita Sesh</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion tried hard to ed­u­cate peo­ple on how to wear the sur­gi­cal mask, on how it con­tains the spread by cap­tur­ing mu­cus, phlegm, saliva... So why are we still talk­ing about fil­tra­tion? Fil­tra­tion of the air we breathe? That is pos­si­ble only with a pow­ered res­pi­ra­tory de­vice.</p>
    <p>Also, why are there no bio­haz­ard bins to dis­pose of used masks? And it is okay to leave a used mask on a din­ner ta­ble or kept in flimsy plas­tic bags for re­use later?</p>
