    <p>The Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore (Muis) is in­ves­ti­gat­ing a self-styled prophet again fol­low­ing a Straits Times re­port on his ac­tiv­i­ties that drew con­cern from many in the Mus­lim com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil yes­ter­day said it was alerted to the case in 2018 and had is­sued a for­mal ad­vi­sory to the man, who is not a qual­i­fied or reg­is­tered re­li­gious teacher un­der the Asati­zah Recog­ni­tion Scheme (ARS), to cease his re­li­gious ac­tiv­i­ties im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ST ar­ti­cle ti­tled “Self-styled prophet said to have five spir­i­tual wives” pub­lished on Mon­day had raised “new and alarm­ing claims” about his ac­tiv­i­ties, the coun­cil said.</p>
    <p>“While Muis is un­able to in­de­pen­dently ver­ify if they in­deed took place, prac­tices such as hav­ing ‘spir­i­tual wives’, gam­bling to help oth­ers, and de­scrib­ing one­self as a prophet are clearly de­viant and a dis­tor­tion to the Is­lamic faith.</p>
    <p>“It is also an of­fence to con­duct a re­li­gious school with­out be­ing reg­is­tered with Muis,” it added.</p>
    <p>ST had re­ported that the man had proclaimed him­self a prophet dur­ing his teach­ing ses­sions. He also al­legedly said gam­bling is al­lowed in or­der to help the needy. Gam­bling is pro­hib­ited in Is­lam.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral men also blamed the al­leged sect leader for end­ing their mar­riages, say­ing the mar­ried man had taken their for­mer part­ners as his spir­i­tual wives.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs Masagos Zulkifli noted in a state­ment on Face­book yes­ter­day that many had ex­pressed con­cern about these al­leged de­viant teach­ings, and said these new claims and al­le­ga­tions had to be in­ves­ti­gated fur­ther by Muis and the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Mem­bers of the pub­lic who have in­for­ma­tion should come for­ward to as­sist this in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>“We should only take proper le­gal re­course for all in­fringe­ment of our laws. Wit­nesses (who) will take a stand in court when re­quired are vi­tal,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Masagos, who is also Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, also said the Mus­lim com­mu­nity should be care­ful when seek­ing re­li­gious guid­ance, and check that the teacher is qual­i­fied un­der the ARS, a data­base of reg­is­tered re­li­gious teach­ers here.</p>
    <p>He added that if mem­bers of the com­mu­nity are un­sure or come across ques­tion­able teach­ings, they should ver­ify them with Muis.</p>
    <p>“Let us stand guard against de­viant and ex­treme teach­ings of Is­lam. We must work to­gether to pro­tect our fam­i­lies and com­mu­nity against neg­a­tive in­flu­ences that will harm them,” he added.</p>
    <p>AGAINST DE­VIANT TEACH­INGS</p>
    <p>In its state­ment, Muis said the Fatwa Com­mit­tee – a panel of top Is­lamic schol­ars here – in­ter­viewed the in­di­vid­ual soon af­ter it was alerted to the case in 2018, “as the na­ture of his ac­tiv­i­ties in the com­plaints ap­peared to be re­li­gious”.</p>
    <p>“He had de­nied any wrong­do­ing then and only ad­mit­ted to of­fer­ing spir­i­tual heal­ing. The com­mit­tee had sub­se­quently ad­min­is­tered a for­mal ad­vi­sory to him to cease such ac­tiv­i­ties im­me­di­ately as he</p>
    <p>was not qual­i­fied to do so,” it said.</p>
    <p>ST’s video on the group had been watched more than 310,000 times as at 8pm yes­ter­day. In ad­di­tion, the clip has been shared about 3,700 times and cur­rently hosts over 1,000 com­ments.</p>
    <p>While some have ex­pressed feel­ings of out­rage, oth­ers said the al­leged leader – a busi­ness­man in his 50s – and his all-fe­male group of fol­low­ers should not be judged harshly. The man, a for­mer mas­sage ther­a­pist, is said to have led the group for the last 15 years.</p>
    <p>ST took three months to break the story, in­ter­view­ing a num­ber of for­mer fol­low­ers and scan­ning through reams of doc­u­ments said to be notes from the teach­ing ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Muis said any­one who knows of in­di­vid­u­als mak­ing du­bi­ous claims or prop­a­gat­ing doubt­ful teach­ings should ver­ify such in­for­ma­tion with Muis or the ARS Of­fice via info@muis.gov.sg</p>
    <p>“We would like to re­mind the com­mu­nity to pro­tect our­selves and our fam­i­lies by seek­ing re­li­gious in­struc­tion only from those who are qual­i­fied and reg­is­tered to do so,” added the coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Let us stand guard against de­viant and ex­treme teach­ings of Is­lam. We must work to­gether to pro­tect our fam­i­lies and com­mu­nity against neg­a­tive in­flu­ences that will harm them.</p>
