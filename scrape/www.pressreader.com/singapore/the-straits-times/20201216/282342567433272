    <p>GENEVA • The Aus­tralian Open next year may be miss­ing one of ten­nis’ big­gest names, af­ter Swiss great Roger Fed­erer ad­mit­ted he was in a “race against time” to be fit for the Grand Slam as his re­cov­ery from two rounds of knee surgery takes longer than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>The 39-year-old has been out of ac­tion since Fe­bru­ary, when he un­der­went key­hole surgery on his right knee. In June, he re­vealed he had a fol­low-up oper­a­tion and called off his 2020 sea­son.</p>
    <p>But de­spite months of re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion, the 20-time Grand Slam cham­pion said he was still not “100 per cent” for the Aus­tralian Open, which looks likely to be de­layed from Jan 18-31 to Feb 8-21 over coron­avirus re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“It’s a race against time. Of course it would help if I had a lit­tle bit more time. But it’s go­ing to be close,” Fed­erer said at an awards cer­e­mony in Switzer­land, ac­cord­ing to the Swiss me­dia.</p>
    <p>“I would have hoped that I’d be at a 100 per cent al­ready in Oc­to­ber. But I’m not at this level even to­day. It will be a close call for the Aus­tralian Open.”</p>
    <p>Fed­erer, who has won the Aus­tralian Open six times, even set off spec­u­la­tion about his fu­ture when he added: “I hope there is still some­thing to see of me in the new year. We will see.”</p>
    <p>The Swiss has con­tested a record 21 con­sec­u­tive Aus­tralian Opens since los­ing in the first round of qual­i­fy­ing in 1999.</p>
    <p>It has been a frus­trat­ing year for Fed­erer, who had to watch from afar as his fre­quent neme­sis, Rafael Nadal, matched his record 20 Grand Slam ti­tles with a 13th vic­tory at the French Open.</p>
    <p>He has given few up­dates on his progress, but early last month he tweeted, “Back to work” with a pic­ture of him prac­tis­ing on court.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, he posted an ATP pro­mo­tional video with the mes­sage, “Ex­cited for what’s to come.”</p>
    <p>Fed­erer said that while “we’re tak­ing our time”, the next two to three months were “im­mensely im­por­tant” as he con­tem­plates a busy 2021 in­clud­ing the Tokyo Olympics, where he is tar­get­ing a first sin­gles gold medal.</p>
    <p>“I wish I’d made more progress, but I’m nev­er­the­less sat­is­fied with where I am,” he said.</p>
    <p>“My sec­ond knee surgery was a huge set­back, but in the past months things have gone steadily for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Fed­erer, known for his el­e­gant style of play, has avoided ma­jor in­juries dur­ing a ca­reer in which he has won 103 sin­gles ti­tles, in­clud­ing all four Grand Slam events.</p>
    <p>He pre­vi­ously had arthro­scopic surgery on his left knee – the first oper­a­tion of his ca­reer – in early 2016, af­ter suf­fer­ing a freak in­jury while run­ning a bath for his daugh­ters.</p>
