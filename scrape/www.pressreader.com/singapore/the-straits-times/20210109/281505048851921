    <p>OCBC Bank has ap­pointed its first fe­male group chief ex­ec­u­tive – and the first woman to head a lo­cal bank. Ms He­len Wong, 59, will suc­ceed Mr Samuel Tsien, 66, who re­tires on April 14 af­ter nine years in the top job. Chair­man Ooi Sang Kuang said the ap­point­ment marks the board’s fo­cus on suc­ces­sion plan­ning and tal­ent man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank has ap­pointed its first fe­male group chief ex­ec­u­tive – and the first woman to head a Sin­ga­pore bank.</p>
    <p>Ms He­len Wong, 59, will suc­ceed group CEO Samuel Tsien, 66, who re­tires on April 14 af­ter nine years in the top job.</p>
    <p>Chair­man Ooi Sang Kuang said yes­ter­day that the ap­point­ment marks the board’s fo­cus on suc­ces­sion plan­ning and tal­ent man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>“We had looked at can­di­dates in­ter­nally in OCBC and within and out­side Sin­ga­pore be­fore we agreed on her as the best qual­i­fied per­son,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Her ex­pe­ri­ences and ex­per­tise ex­tend be­yond cor­po­rate bank­ing, Greater China and North Asia. She also ran a large bank­ing op­er­a­tion of a global bank as the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Greater China, in­clud­ing Hong Kong, prior to join­ing OCBC.</p>
    <p>“We are con­fi­dent that He­len will be able to lead the OCBC Group to greater heights in an in­creas­ingly com­plex and chal­leng­ing en­vi­ron­ment,” he added.</p>
    <p>The move to have a woman in a top lead­er­ship po­si­tion of a fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion is a good break­through, said Ms Huang Shao-Ning, chief an­gel in­vestor of an­gel in­vest­ment net­work firm An­gelCen­tral.</p>
    <p>“It shows the will­ing­ness of top lo­cal banks to trust women in man­age­ment,” she noted. “It is def­i­nitely a strong sig­nal that the sky is the limit for any woman who is will­ing to work, strive and de­liver re­sults.”</p>
    <p>This move can also spur other fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to choose fe­male lead­ers, she added.</p>
    <p>“Lead­er­ship ap­point­ments look for both tal­ent and abil­ity to de­liver. We have no lack of such ca­pa­ble women, and OCBC’s move shows that it is not a ques­tion of if, but of when,” said Ms Huang.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong started her bank­ing ca­reer with OCBC in 1984, and was its first China desk man­ager.</p>
    <p>In 1986, she moved on to other len­ders in Greater China be­fore join­ing HSBC in 1992, working in var­i­ous roles in in­vest­ment and cor­po­rate bank­ing.</p>
    <p>She was also re­spon­si­ble for HSBC’s debt cap­i­tal mar­kets busi­ness in Greater China, and was later the head of global bank­ing in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong also had a stint in Shang­hai. Her last po­si­tion be­fore re­join­ing OCBC last year was as HSBC’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Greater China di­vi­sion, with re­spon­si­bil­i­ties that in­cluded main­land China, Hong Kong, Ma­cau and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>She also served as chair­man of the Hong Kong As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in 2015.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong has been OCBC’s deputy pres­i­dent and head of global whole­sale bank­ing since last Fe­bru­ary, and co-led a task force to re­view the bank’s strat­egy and op­er­at­ing model.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said yes­ter­day: “Al­though Covid-19 struck fiercely at the econ­omy and im­pacted many lives and liveli­hoods, we nav­i­gated the storm deftly thanks to (Mr Tsien’s) lead­er­ship, the team’s united ef­forts and the board’s guid­ance.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ooi said Mr Tsien had sig­nif­i­cantly built the OCBC fran­chise into a much more di­ver­si­fied and re­silient busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Un­der his lead­er­ship, the group strength­ened its fun­da­men­tals in cap­i­tal, liq­uid­ity and its tech­no­log­i­cal ca­pa­bil­i­ties, OCBC noted.</p>
    <p>The bank also deep­ened its re­gional pres­ence by us­ing its global net­work strength and busi­ness con­nec­tiv­ity to cap­ture op­por­tu­ni­ties in do­mes­tic mar­kets.</p>
    <p>OCBC achieved a net profit of $4.87 bil­lion in 2019, more than dou­bling 2011’s earn­ings of $2.31 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>To­tal as­sets grew to $492 bil­lion in 2019 from $278 bil­lion in 2011.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said: “The team and I will now con­tinue to build on OCBC’s strong foun­da­tions to fur­ther en­trench it as a lead­ing and pro­gres­sive re­gional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion.”</p>
