    <p>BOS­TON • Trop­i­cal Storm Eta made land­fall in the mid­dle of Florida Keys overnight, be­com­ing the year’s record 12th named storm in the United States.</p>
    <p>It is set to drift west, grow in strength and make a sec­ond run at the Sun­shine State north of Tampa city.</p>
    <p>The trop­i­cal storm made land­fall in the area at around 11pm lo­cal time on Sun­day and moved across Florida Bay, off the coast of south­west­ern Florida, the US National Hur­ri­cane Cen­tre (NHC) said in a no­tice is­sued at 4am yes­ter­day in New York.</p>
    <p>The storm has max­i­mum sus­tained winds near 100kmh and it may strengthen to be­come a hur­ri­cane when it moves over the south-eastern Gulf of Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>“The storm has gen­er­ally changed lit­tle in strength overnight,” the NHC said. “Bands of heavy rain and trop­i­cal-storm­force winds con­tinue over por­tions of the Florida Keys, and south and cen­tral Florida.”</p>
    <p>The storm “will have an op­por­tu­nity to strengthen a lit­tle” over the next cou­ple of days and it could be­come a hur­ri­cane as it moves over the warm wa­ters of the Gulf of Mex­ico Loop Cur­rent, the NHC added. Eta pre­vi­ously made land­fall in Cuba early on Sun­day with strong winds of more than 100kmh and heavy rain.</p>
    <p>The storm killed more than 50 peo­ple across Cen­tral Amer­ica last week and over 100 oth­ers are miss­ing af­ter it struck that re­gion as a ma­jor hur­ri­cane, ac­cord­ing to the As­so­ci­ated Press.</p>
    <p>Eta adds to a record-break­ing At­lantic hur­ri­cane sea­son that has al­ready seen hun­dreds of deaths, bil­lions of dol­lars in dam­age, and a to­tal of 28 storms.</p>
    <p>So many storms have formed that the hur­ri­cane cen­tre used up all the names on the of­fi­cial list by mid-Septem­ber and has had to use Greek let­ters to des­ig­nate sub­se­quent sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The NHC’s track fore­cast cur­rently takes Eta on a back­wardques­tion-mark-like path through the eastern Gulf of Mex­ico. Its threat to off­shore oil and nat­u­ral gas pro­duc­tion will likely be low.</p>
    <p>For the US, Eta’s de­struc­tion prob­a­bly will not match the pro­por­tions of the tragedy still un­fold­ing across Cen­tral Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>The US eco­nomic tally will prob­a­bly be less than US$100 mil­lion (S$134 mil­lion) in in­sured losses, said Mr Chuck Wat­son, a disas­ter mod­eller for Enki Re­search.</p>
    <p>Florida Gov­er­nor Ron DeSan­tis has de­clared an emer­gency in ad­vance of Eta.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to Eta, fore­cast­ers are also watch­ing an­other po­ten­tial storm in the cen­tral At­lantic that has a 40 per cent chance of form­ing in the next five days, the hur­ri­cane cen­tre said.</p>
