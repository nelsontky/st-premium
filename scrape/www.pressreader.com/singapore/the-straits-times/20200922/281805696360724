    <p>•</p>
    <p>China is ratch­et­ing up the risk of mil­i­tary con­fronta­tion in the Tai­wan Strait, as it seeks to de­ter Taipei from con­tin­u­ing to deepen ties with the US and other like-minded democ­ra­cies.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA) air­craft re­peat­edly breached the me­dian line be­tween Tai­wan and the Chi­nese main­land last week, in the lat­est of a se­ries of mil­i­tary ex­er­cises in the area.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese pi­lots sig­nalled a will­ing­ness to con­tinue the prac­tice, telling Tai­wanese per­son­nel who tried to warn them away that “there is no me­dian line”, the Taipei-based China Times news­pa­per re­ported last Fri­day, cit­ing un­named mil­i­tary of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>The re­port was widely cir­cu­lated by Chi­nese state me­dia, with the PLA’s East­ern The­atre Com­mand re­spond­ing to one post by urg­ing cit­i­zens to “dis­card any il­lu­sions and pre­pare to fight”.</p>
    <p>The PLA Air Force sep­a­rately re­leased a video last Satur­day show­ing H-6 bombers mak­ing a sim­u­lated strike on a run­way that looked sim­i­lar to one at An­der­son Air Force Base in Guam, a key stag­ing area for any US sup­port for Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>“The risks of war are ris­ing con­sid­er­ably, and re­draw­ing the map over the me­dian line in the Tai­wan Strait is a very ob­vi­ous step by Bei­jing to not only raise the pres­sure, but also jus­tify use of force,” said Mr Mal­colm Davis, a for­mer de­fence ad­viser to the gov­ern­ment and now a se­nior an­a­lyst at the Aus­tralian Strate­gic Pol­icy In­sti­tute in Canberra.</p>
    <p>“These ag­gres­sive probes are per­haps de­signed to pro­voke the Tai­wanese air force to ‘shoot first’ and then Bei­jing has all the jus­ti­fi­ca­tion it needs.”</p>
    <p>Tai­wan Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen last week hosted US Un­der­sec­re­tary of State Keith Krach and a Ja­panese del­e­ga­tion in Taipei, in the lat­est show of in­ter­na­tional sup­port for her gov­ern­ment. The of­fi­cials at­tended the fu­neral on Satur­day of Tai­wan’s first demo­crat­i­cally elected pres­i­dent, Mr Lee Teng-hui, whose poli­cies to­wards Bei­jing were at the cen­tre of the last big mil­i­tary show­down be­tween China and the US in the strait in the late 1990s.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing re­gards the is­land as part of its ter­ri­tory, and re­serves the right to an­nex it by force, even though the two sides have been ruled sep­a­rately for more than 70 years and have deep so­cial and eco­nomic ties.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai, who views Tai­wan as a sov­er­eign na­tion, has courted greater mil­i­tary and eco­nomic sup­port from Washington since her elec­tion in 2016.</p>
    <p>The in­cur­sions across the me­dian line, which the US es­tab­lished in 1954 to pre­vent a con­flict, sig­nal Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s dis­plea­sure with the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s over­tures to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Nine­teen Chi­nese war­planes, in­clud­ing fighter jets and bombers, crossed the cen­tre line last Satur­day, ac­cord­ing to Tai­wan’s De­fence Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan scram­bled fight­ers and de­ployed an air-de­fence mis­sile sys­tem, fol­low­ing sim­i­lar action the day be­fore. Chi­nese mil­i­tary air­craft have crossed the me­dian line five times since March last year, af­ter re­spect­ing the buf­fer zone for two decades.</p>
    <p>China’s “sce­nario-based” mil­i­tary ex­er­cises in the Tai­wan Strait were in­tended to pro­mote the is­land’s “se­cu­rity and sovereignt­y”, Se­nior Colonel Ren Guo­qiang, a De­fence Min­istry spokesman, told re­porters in Bei­jing on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Col Ren blamed the United States and Tai­wan for “fre­quently stir­ring up trou­ble”.</p>
    <p>Such mil­i­tary in­cur­sions can help plan­ners learn about a target’s de­fence ca­pa­bil­i­ties, di­vert at­ten­tion from an ac­tual strike or put po­lit­i­cal pres­sure on a ri­val. For Mr Xi, they also serve to gal­vanise do­mes­tic pub­lic opin­ion around his lead­er­ship at a time of eco­nomic and geopo­lit­i­cal un­ease.</p>
    <p>Re­search fel­low Su Tzu-yun at the In­sti­tute for Na­tional De­fence and Se­cu­rity Re­search in Taipei said the in­cur­sions were aimed at whip­ping up na­tion­al­is­tic fer­vour at home, adding: “Bei­jing ma­nip­u­lates na­tion­al­ism. Es­pe­cially in the face of in­ter­nal con­tra­dic­tions, na­tion­al­ism can shift the fo­cus and pres­sure. There is a greater risk of es­ca­la­tion and a mil­i­tary con­fronta­tion oc­cur­ring, but cur­rently it doesn’t ben­e­fit Bei­jing to do so.”</p>
    <p>The in­cur­sions across the me­dian line, which the US es­tab­lished in 1954 to pre­vent a con­flict, sig­nal Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s dis­plea­sure with the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s over­tures to Tai­wan.</p>
