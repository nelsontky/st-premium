    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia are work­ing to­wards im­ple­ment­ing green lane and pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ments on Aug 10, the two coun­tries’ for­eign min­is­ters an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane is meant for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial pur­poses, while the com­mut­ing ar­range­ment al­lows long-term work pass hold­ers to en­ter ei­ther coun­try for work and go home for a short pe­riod af­ter three months.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came af­ter Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian coun­ter­part Muhyid­din Yassin dis­cussed the grad­ual and phased re­sump­tion of cross-bor­der travel last month.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia have agreed to start cross-bor­der travel for long-term pass hold­ers and trav­ellers on es­sen­tial or of­fi­cial busi­ness, sched­uled to be­gin on Aug 10.</p>
    <p>Malaysian For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein and Sin­ga­pore For­eign Min­is­ter Vi­vian Balakrishn­an an­nounced the re­cip­ro­cal green lane and pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble trav­ellers for the green lane – meant for those on es­sen­tial or of­fi­cial busi­ness – will have to abide by mea­sures, in­clud­ing tak­ing Covid-19 swab tests and sub­mit­ting their itin­er­ar­ies.</p>
    <p>The pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment will al­low Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia res­i­dents who hold longterm im­mi­gra­tion passes for busi­ness and work pur­poses in the other coun­try to en­ter that coun­try for work.</p>
    <p>Af­ter at least three con­sec­u­tive months in their coun­try of work, they may re­turn to their home coun­try for short-term home leave, and there­after re-en­ter their coun­try of work to con­tinue work­ing for at least an­other three con­sec­u­tive months, said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed Aug 10 date will give the rel­e­vant agen­cies of both gov­ern­ments time to fi­nalise the stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures for both ini­tia­tives, said the state­ment.</p>
    <p>The re­quire­ments, health pro­to­cols and ap­pli­ca­tion process in­volved for en­try and exit in Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore will be pub­lished 10 days be­fore their im­ple­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Dr Balakrishn­an wrote: “Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia share deep and ex­ten­sive ties, and cross-bor­der peo­ple-to-peo­ple in­ter­ac­tions and eco­nomic ex­changes are im­por­tant to both coun­tries. Through these travel ar­range­ments, we hope to pro­gres­sively and safely re­store these ex­changes and ad­dress the needs of dif­fer­ent groups of trav­ellers. ’’</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE FOR­EIGN MIN­IS­TER VI­VIAN BALAKRISHN­AN</p>
    <p>and Malaysia share deep and ex­ten­sive ties, and cross-bor­der peo­pleto-peo­ple in­ter­ac­tions and eco­nomic ex­changes are im­por­tant to both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“Through these travel ar­range­ments, we hope to pro­gres­sively and safely re­store these ex­changes and ad­dress the needs of dif­fer­ent groups of trav­ellers.”</p>
    <p>The two coun­tries have also agreed to de­velop other schemes for cross-bor­der move­ment, in­clud­ing a pro­posal for daily cross-bor­der com­mut­ing for work pur­poses.</p>
    <p>This will take into ac­count the re­quired health pro­to­cols and avail­able med­i­cal re­sources in both coun­tries to en­sure the safety of the cit­i­zens of both sides.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Covid-19 re­stric­tions were in place, more than 300,000 peo­ple, many of them Malaysians work­ing in Sin­ga­pore, crossed the land check­points be­tween the two coun­tries daily.</p>
    <p>Some Malaysian work­ers re­mained in Sin­ga­pore when the move­ment con­trol or­der came into force on March 18.</p>
    <p>Since last month, Malaysia has been in a “re­cov­ery phase”, but its in­ter­na­tional bor­ders re­main shut.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore be­gan the re­open­ing of its bor­ders on June 8, a week af­ter it lifted its cir­cuit breaker, by launch­ing a “fast lane” agree­ment with China. This al­lowed es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel to re­sume, with some re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, most other long-term pass hold­ers ar­riv­ing in Sin­ga­pore – with the ex­cep­tion of those ar­riv­ing from cer­tain places such as New Zealand, Ja­pan and Viet­nam – still have to serve a 14-day stay-home no­tice pe­riod at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Malaysian Alex Helly, 38, a longterm work pass holder who has not re­turned home to Ku­lai in Jo­hor since March 17, said he was count­ing down the days to re­unit­ing with his wife and child.</p>
    <p>The data cen­tre fa­cil­i­ties en­gi­neer, who has been liv­ing with his brother, told The Straits Times: “I’m look­ing for­ward to go­ing back as I’ve been video-call­ing my wife and one-year-old daugh­ter every day. That’s all I can do now.”</p>
    <p>But the eas­ing of re­stric­tions will not ap­ply to oth­ers like Sin­ga­porean Tan Yam Hon, who runs a busi­ness ex­port­ing malt waste to Malaysia to be used as poul­try feed.</p>
    <p>He used to visit Malaysia reg­u­larly to su­per­vise his work­ers there, but has not en­tered the coun­try since March.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, 48, does not have a longterm work pass for Malaysia as his main of­fice is in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“It’s not yet con­firmed that we can go into Malaysia and out with­out hav­ing to serve the quar­an­tine pe­riod on both sides, so we’re still wait­ing for good news,” he said.</p>
