    <p>Quah Ting Wen (above) has clocked her se­cond short-course na­tional record in a week with a 25.35sec swim to place se­cond in the women’s 50m but­ter­fly at the In­ter­na­tional Swim­ming League in Bu­dapest, Hun­gary, on Satur­day. She had rewrit­ten the short-course 50m freestyle mark at the same meet last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>It had been so long since na­tional swim­mer Quah Ting Wen com­peted in the short-course 50m but­ter­fly that she can­not even re­mem­ber her last race in the event.</p>
    <p>But that meant lit­tle as she claimed her se­cond short-course na­tional record of the week af­ter clock­ing 25.35 sec­onds to come in se­cond in the women’s 50m fly at the In­ter­na­tional Swim­ming League (ISL) in Bu­dapest last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>She had clocked 25.66sec at the</p>
    <p>Duna Arena ear­lier in the week, but the 28-year-old did not think much about break­ing an­other na­tional record as it seemed far from Tao Li’s 2013 mark of 25.43sec.</p>
    <p>Quah, who com­petes for ISL team DC Tri­dent, said: “Fifty me­tres is the short­est event and it’s hard to drop time. There wasn’t a lot of time to train and get a lot fit­ter.</p>
    <p>“I just fo­cused on the things I felt I could’ve done bet­ter, try­ing to per­fect ev­ery­thing a lit­tle bit more, sharpen the lit­tle de­tails, keep it cleaner and snap­pier, and the swim felt bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“I don’t re­ally chase time. The whole goal is to win as many points for the re­spec­tive teams, so when I saw I came in se­cond, I was re­ally happy with that.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the few days be­tween her two 50m fly races, Quah worked on her turns as she felt like she did not use the mo­men­tum go­ing into the wall to turn fast in the first race last Tues­day.</p>
    <p>That paid off as she fin­ished se­cond be­hind LA Cur­rent’s French swim­mer Beryl Gastaldell­o (24.95sec) and ahead of third­placed Marie Wat­tel (25.52) from Lon­don Roar.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day, Quah rewrote the short-course 50m freestyle mark af­ter touch­ing the wall in 24.26sec, eclips­ing Amanda Lim’s mark of 25.09sec set in 2014.</p>
    <p>“With each race, I’m get­ting a bit more com­fort­able. My body and mind are primed each time to know what to ex­pect and to take what I learn from the pre­vi­ous race and im­ple­ment it in the next one,” said Quah, who is also the na­tional record holder in the long-course 50m, 100m and 200m freestyle.</p>
    <p>Quah is the first Sin­ga­porean to com­pete in the ISL, an in­ter-team com­pe­ti­tion for pro­fes­sional swim­mers that is now into its se­cond sea­son. Be­ing sur­rounded by other swim­mers who un­der­stand what it is like to be a pro ath­lete and shar­ing sim­i­lar ex­pe­ri­ences with them has helped the Sin­ga­porean en­joy her time in Hun­gary.</p>
    <p>She said: “It hasn’t felt this good in a re­ally long time and I’m just re­ally grate­ful to have this op­por­tu­nity to ex­pe­ri­ence this and un­der­stand what it feels like to be a pro­fes­sional and to be a part of a team even in an in­di­vid­ual sport.</p>
    <p>“And it’s just given me a lot of con­fi­dence in my­self. Phys­i­cally, I don’t think I’m at my fittest but that’s the thing right?</p>
    <p>“To be able to race so fast even when I’m not at my fittest helps me a lot men­tally and I’m just hav­ing fun.”</p>
