    <p>The first Arab space mis­sion to Mars, an un­manned probe dubbed Al-Amal (or Hope), blasted off from Ja­pan yes­ter­day on a mis­sion to re­veal more about the at­mos­phere of the Red Planet. The launch of the probe had twice been de­layed be­cause of bad weather.</p>
    <p>TOKYO • The first Arab space mis­sion to Mars, an un­manned probe dubbed Al-Amal (or Hope), blasted off from Ja­pan yes­ter­day on a mis­sion to re­veal more about the at­mos­phere of the Red Planet.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese rocket car­ry­ing the probe de­vel­oped by the United Arab Emi­rates (UAE) lifted off from the Tane­gashima Space Cen­tre in south­ern Ja­pan right on sched­ule at 6.58am lo­cal time.</p>
    <p>The l aunch of the probe had twice been de­layed be­cause of bad weather, but yes­ter­day’s liftoff ap­peared smooth and suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>An hour later, a live feed showed peo­ple ap­plaud­ing in the Ja­panese con­trol room as the probe suc­cess­fully de­tached.</p>
    <p>In Dubai, the launch was met with rap­tur­ous ex­cite­ment and blan­ket me­dia cov­er­age, with the Burj Khal­ifa – the world’s tallest skyscraper at 828m – lit up hours be­fore liftoff with a sym­bolic 10-sec­ond count­down in an­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>“We proudly an­nounce the suc­cess­ful launch of the Hope probe,” Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mo­hammed bin Rashid Al-Mak­toum, said in a tweet.</p>
    <p>“The ground con­trol sta­tion in Dubai has re­ceived the first sig­nal from the probe af­ter its so­lar pan­els were suc­cess­fully de­ployed to charge its bat­ter­ies. Our 493 mil­lion km jour­ney to the Red Planet starts here.”</p>
    <p>Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan said the coun­try watched the launch with “pride and joy” as the na­tion em­barked on a “new chap­ter in space”.</p>
    <p>Only the United States, In­dia, the for­mer Soviet Union, and the Euro­pean Space Agency have suc­cess­fully sent mis­sions to or­bit the fourth planet from the Sun, while China is pre­par­ing to launch its first Mars rover later this month.</p>
    <p>The Emi­rati project is one of three racing to Mars, in­clud­ing Tian­wen-1 from China and Mars 2020 from the US, tak­ing ad­van­tage of a pe­riod when Earth and Mars are near­est to each other.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Mars will be a com­par­a­tively close 62.07mil­lion km from Earth, ac­cord­ing to US space agency Nasa.</p>
    <p>The Hope probe is ex­pected to en­ter Mars or­bit by next Fe­bru­ary, mark­ing the 50th an­niver­sary of the uni­fi­ca­tion of the UAE, an al­liance of seven emi­rates.</p>
    <p>Un­like the two other Mars ven­tures sched­uled for this year, it will not land on the Red Planet, but in­stead or­bit it for a whole Mar­tian year, or 687 days.</p>
    <p>While the ob­jec­tive of the UAE’s mis­sion is to pro­vide a com­pre­hen­sive im­age of the weather dy­nam­ics, the probe is a foun­da­tion for a much big­ger goal – build­ing a hu­man set­tle­ment on Mars within the next 100 years.</p>
    <p>Dubai has hired ar­chi­tects to imag­ine what a Mar­tian city might look like and to build it in its desert as “Sci­ence City”.</p>
    <p>The UAE also wants the project to serve as a source of in­spi­ra­tion for Arab youth, in a re­gion too of­ten wracked by sec­tar­ian con­flicts and eco­nomic crises.</p>
    <p>“This mis­sion is an im­por­tant mile­stone for the UAE and the re­gion,” said Mr Yousuf Ha­mad AlShaibani, di­rec­tor of the UAE’s Mo­hammed bin Rashid Space Cen­tre, at a post-launch press con­fer­ence in Ja­pan. “It has al­ready in­spired mil­lions of youth re­gion­ally to dream big and work hard to achieve what seems to be im­pos­si­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>On Twit­ter, the UAE gov­ern­ment de­clared the probe launch a “mes­sage of pride, hope and peace to the Arab re­gion, in which we re­new the golden age of Arab and Is­lamic dis­cov­er­ies”.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral dozen probes – most of them Amer­i­can – have set off for Mars since the 1960s. Many never made it that far, or failed to land.</p>
    <p>The drive to ex­plore the Red Planet flagged un­til the con­fir­ma­tion less than 10 years ago that wa­ter once flowed on its sur­face.</p>
    <p>The Hope probe is ex­pected to be­gin trans­mit­ting in­for­ma­tion back to Earth in Septem­ber next year, with its data avail­able for sci­en­tists around the world to study.</p>
    <p>The UAE al­ready has nine func­tion­ing satel­lites in Earth or­bit, with plans to launch an­other eight in the com­ing years.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber last year, it sent the first Emi­rati into space on a mis­sion to the In­ter­na­tional Space Sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Dubai has hired ar­chi­tects to imag­ine what a Mar­tian city might look like and to build it in its desert as “Sci­ence City”. The UAE also wants the project to serve as a source of in­spi­ra­tion for Arab youth, in a re­gion too of­ten wracked by sec­tar­ian con­flicts and eco­nomic crises.</p>
