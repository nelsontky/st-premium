        Invest | | B12 The Sunday Times Sunday, September 13, 2020 BROUGHT TO YOU BY I n view of unpreceden­ted global market volatility and an uncertain future as we navigate the ongoing pandemic, holding liquid assets such as cash may seem like the safest financial choice.
However, with interest rates likely to stay near zero for the foreseeabl­e future, it may be prudent for investors to consider putting their money to work. Letting capital sit idly in a low-interest savings account is a risk in itself, as its value will erode over the long term through inflation.
Within income investing, there are solutions that are more defensive, with relatively low volatility and quick access to capital.
These could be viable alternativ­es to conservati­ve investors who want to hold only cash, those looking to reduce portfolio risk or others looking to park their money while they wait for the next opportunit­y. bonds, they typically offer higher returns than cash. While markets experience­d extreme turbulence earlier this year, many have since rebounded.
However, some investors may want to park their capital over the short-term and still earn a return while they wait for compelling opportunit­ies to arise.
By placing money in a fund with liquidity features similar to money market instrument­s, investors may enjoy potentiall­y higher yields than cash, along with the flexibilit­y to move their capital quickly into new strategies. In today’s environmen­t, it’s natural to feel more secure to have cash on hand when we need it.
Investing your cash in an activelyma­naged bond fund that offers liquidity with stability and enhanced income potential may help to build a stronger foundation for future needs.
To find out more about Fidelity’s income solutions beyond the obvious, please visit https://www.fidelity.com.sg/ investment/income. Investing in a portfolio of government and highly-rated corporate bonds may offer income with relatively lower levels of volatility and capital risk compared to other income-generating assets such as higher-paying high-yield bonds or equities.
A bond is essentiall­y a loan, raised by a government or company, and financed by investors. The income that an investor receives from a bond is called a coupon.
Bonds with shorter maturities may potentiall­y offer a level of stability, given that they are less sensitive to interest rate movements. Though they usually pay lower interest than longer-term Remain invested during volatility, and you can typically benefit in the long term. Diversific­ation helps smooth returns — investment­s vary in risk and volatility. Diversifyi­ng across asset classes, sectors and regions, can help reduce volatility effects.
Active investing can be a successful strategy — at Fidelity, we believe strongly in active management. Our bottom-up approach means we are well-positioned to invest during bouts of market volatility.
