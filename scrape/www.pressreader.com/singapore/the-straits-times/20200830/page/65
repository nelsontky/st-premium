As the name suggests, income investing involves buying assets that are likely to deliver a consistent cash stream that is paid monthly or annually, over a length of time. It can also serve as a good diversifie­r to equity and growth strategies.
There are a few different paths that investors can take to harness income that matches different income needs – interest payments from bonds, dividends from equities or from a mix of both, otherwise known as multi asset investing.
