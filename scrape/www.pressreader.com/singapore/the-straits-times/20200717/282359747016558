    <p>LON­DON • Foot­ball teams will be al­lowed to con­tinue us­ing five sub­sti­tutes un­til the end of next sea­son af­ter the sport’s law­mak­ers ex­tended a tem­po­rary so­lu­tion to a con­gested sched­ule in the wake of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion Board (IFAB) said on Wed­nes­day the mea­sures were taken due to the short turn­around be­tween the end of the 2019-20 sea­son and start of the new cam­paign, and the fact matches will be played in a con­densed pe­riod due to a de­layed start to the sea­son.</p>
    <p>IFAB said: “Some com­pe­ti­tions which re­sumed in 2020 may have a shorter-than-usual recovery and prepa­ra­tion pe­riod be­fore the start of their next sea­son.</p>
    <p>“For many com­pe­ti­tions, the 2020-21 sea­son will in­volve matches be­ing played in a con­densed pe­riod due to a de­layed start and the in­abil­ity to end later than usual be­cause of ma­jor in­ter­na­tional tour­na­ments.”</p>
    <p>The cur­rent Pre­mier League sea­son ends next week­end and while there has been no of­fi­cial an­nounce­ment on when the new term starts, Bri­tish me­dia re­ports have hinted at an early Septem­ber kick-off. That would mean a break of just over a month, down from the usual three months.</p>
    <p>It would be even shorter for teams still in­volved in Cham­pi­ons League and Europa League ac­tion like Manch­ester City, Manch­ester United, Wolves and Chelsea.</p>
    <p>Each in­di­vid­ual league and in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion will have the op­tion to de­cide whether to ap­ply the new rule or stick by the prepan­demic reg­u­la­tions of a max­i­mum of three sub­sti­tutes per side for a 90-minute match.</p>
    <p>To avoid dis­rup­tion to the game, each team will only have three op­por­tu­ni­ties to make sub­sti­tu­tions, al­though changes made at half­time are not counted as one of those stop­pages.</p>
