    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Amer­i­can ac­tor Matthew McConaughe­y dis­closes in his new mem­oir that he was sex­u­ally abused when he was a teenager.</p>
    <p>In Green­lights, which was re­leased on Tues­day, the 50-year-old ac­tor lists sev­eral mo­ments in his life and ca­reer as green, yel­low or red lights – sim­i­lar to the colour code on traf­fic lights. Th­ese events caused him to ad­vance, pause or stop, said Va­ri­ety mag­a­zine.</p>
    <p>He be­gins his mem­oir by shar­ing facts about him­self, in­clud­ing sev­eral dis­turb­ing in­ci­dents of sex­ual abuse.</p>
    <p>“I was black­mailed into hav­ing sex for the first time when I was 15,” the Os­car-win­ning ac­tor of Dal­las Buy­ers Club (2013) writes in his au­to­bi­og­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>“I was cer­tain I was go­ing to hell for the pre­mar­i­tal sex. To­day, I am merely cer­tain that I hope that’s not the case.”</p>
    <p>McConaughe­y also men­tions in the book an­other in­ci­dent when he was mo­lested by a man when he was 18, “while knocked un­con­scious in the back of a van”.</p>
    <p>He does not re­veal fur­ther de­tails on both in­ci­dents, but says he does not con­sider him­self a vic­tim of the sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“I’ve never felt like a vic­tim,” he writes. “I have a lot of proof that the world is con­spir­ing to make me happy.”</p>
    <p>Known for star­ring in ro­man­tic come­dies such as The Wed­ding Plan­ner (2001), How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days (2003) and Ghosts Of Girl­friends Past (2009), the ac­tor re­counts in the book how he landed his break­through role in com­ing-of-age comedy film Dazed And Con­fused (1993) and his first lead­ing role in the 1996 film adap­ta­tion of John Gr­isham’s le­gal novel A Time To Kill.</p>
    <p>Mar­ried to model and de­signer Camila Alves with three chil­dren, he also writes about his par­ents’ stormy re­la­tion­ship, his mar­riage and his phi­los­o­phy in the mem­oir.</p>
