    <p>The bat­tle for Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics’ (SA) top post is hot­ting up af­ter vet­eran lawyer Ed­mond Pereira an­nounced yes­ter­day that he is throw­ing his hat into the ring to take on the team led by Go­jek gen­eral man­ager Lien Choong Luen.</p>
    <p>Helmed by 70-year-old Pereira, who also ran for the pres­i­dency in 2016, TeamSGP Ath­let­ics’ nine­mem­ber team in­clude fa­mil­iar faces such as swim­ming le­gend Ang Peng Siong and lawyer S. Govin­daraju, who are cur­rently SA’s vice-pres­i­dents of train­ing and se­lec­tion, and com­pe­ti­tions or­gan­is­ing, re­spec­tively. For­mer na­tional sprinter and 100m record holder U.K. Shyam and Tampines Rovers chair­man Des­mond Ong are also in the mix.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics pres­i­dent Tang Weng Fei has de­cided not to seek re-elec­tion at the as­so­ci­a­tion’s an­nual gen­eral meet­ing on Sept 25.</p>
    <p>This is Pereira’s fifth bid for the pres­i­dency. He con­tested and lost thrice in 1983, 1985 and 2000 to Loh Lin Kok. In 2016, he was beaten to the top job by Ho Mun Cheong af­ter los­ing the vote, 11-9.</p>
    <p>“I last took part in 2016. It was a very closely con­tested elec­tion,” said Pereira yes­ter­day. “But what hap­pened af­ter was very sad for the sport.”</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, the na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tion has been plagued by a num­ber of is­sues such as in­fight­ing, le­gal woes and the poor per­for­mances of its ath­letes.</p>
    <p>At last year’s SEA Games in the Philip­pines, its ath­letes failed to win a gold medal for the first time since 1991, and the in­fight­ing saw SA com­ing un­der fire from na­tional agency Sport Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>That is why a key fo­cus for Pereira’s team is build­ing trust with the var­i­ous stake­hold­ers in the fra­ter­nity.</p>
    <p>“Trust needs to be earned, which is why it is my hope that with the new faces on our team, we will have ath­letes share their griev­ances</p>
    <p>Trust needs to be earned, which is why it is my hope that with the new faces on our team, we will have ath­letes share their griev­ances openly so that we can hear them and find so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>openly so that we can hear them and find so­lu­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>While the team will share more de­tails of their man­i­festo in a Zoom ses­sion with af­fil­i­ates on Thurs­day, they aim to de­velop the sport through a five-point plan that will see them “plan, en­gage, em­power, pro­fes­sion­alise and act”.</p>
    <p>If elected, spe­cific com­mit­tees will also be set up to over­see var­i­ous as­pects of the sport, such as mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, fundrais</p>
    <p>ing and spon­sor­ship, and de­vel­op­ing the sport for fe­male ath­letes.</p>
    <p>The team also want to make track and field clubs pro­fes­sional and cre­ate new path­ways for ath­letes when they leave the sport.</p>
    <p>Pereira said: “There is so much work to be done and also to look at from the pre­vi­ous ad­min­is­tra­tion, is­sues which we need to find clo­sure with. The strength of our team is that we have peo­ple with dif­fer­ent skill sets.”</p>
    <p>For­mer hur­dler Ong added: “It is our col­lec­tive dream to see the sport pro­duce cham­pi­ons at all lev­els, and for me, it is an ex­ten­sion of my con­tri­bu­tion to the sports fra­ter­nity in ad­di­tion to my work at Tampines Rovers.”</p>
    <p>Pereira’s team will face Lien’s Team Ground Up, which in­cludes for­mer na­tional sprinter Gary Yeo, in the SA elec­tion.</p>
