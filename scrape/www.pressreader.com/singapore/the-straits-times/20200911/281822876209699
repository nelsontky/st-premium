    <p>Myan­mar po­lice de­tained three stu­dents af­ter break­ing up an anti-gov­ern­ment demon­stra­tion i n the restive Rakhine state on Wed­nes­day, a stu­dent group and a hu­man rights body said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They said the three men, in their early twen­ties, were taken away in the state cap­i­tal of Sit­twe af­ter protest­ing with plac­ards that read “op­pose mur­der­ing fas­cism” and call­ing for the restora­tion of In­ter­net ac­cess, which the au­thor­i­ties say has been cut in swathes of Rakhine for se­cu­rity rea­sons.</p>
    <p>A po­lice of­fi­cer in Sit­twe hung up the phone when con­tacted by Reuters for com­ment on the de­ten­tion of the stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Video footage streamed on so­cial me­dia from the po­lice sta­tion yes­ter­day showed dozens of peo­ple out­side de­mand­ing the re­lease of the men.</p>
    <p>Rakhine has been roiled for more than a year by fight­ing be­tween gov­ern­ment troops and eth­nic in­sur­gents from the Arakan Army, which is fight­ing for greater au­ton­omy for the west­ern re­gion.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands have been dis­placed and dozens killed i n shelling and cross­fire.</p>
    <p>Mr Thaw Zin Tun, a spokesman for the Arakan Stu­dents’ Union, the group that or­gan­ised the protest, said yes­ter­day that the three had been de­tained pend­ing fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tion, but there had been no con­tact with them since their ar­rest.</p>
    <p>The Burma Hu­man Rights Net­work (BHRN), a Bri­tain-based</p>
    <p>cam­paign group, said that the three ar­rested were part of a group of stu­dents who had vis­ited mi­nor­ity Ro­hingya camps out­side Sit­twe in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands of Ro­hingya, a Mus­lim mi­nor­ity in Rakhine state, are con­fined to camps and vil­lages and de­prived of rights in­clud­ing free­dom of move­ment. The state has long been a tin­der­box of ten­sion be­tween Ro­hingya and eth­nic Rakhine, a mostly Bud­dhist group that make up the ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Kyaw Win, the founder of the BHRN, said the stu­dents were “an ex­am­ple of a way to a bet­ter fu­ture in Burma, yet have been crim­i­nalised and de­prived of their free­doms”.</p>
