    <p>Next month, Sony and Mi­crosoft will go head to head once again as both tech gi­ants launch their re­spec­tive ver­sions of the next-gen­er­a­tion gam­ing con­sole – the PlayS­ta­tion 5 (PS5) and Xbox Se­ries X.</p>
    <p>Seven years ago, the ri­vals launched the PlayS­ta­tion 4 (PS4) and the Xbox One, which cul­mi­nated in an al­most one-sided bat­tle where the PS4 out­sold the Xbox One by three to one.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to mar­ket re­search firm VGChartz, more than 113 mil­lion PS4 units have been sold glob­ally to date, com­pared with Xbox One’s 48 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>While gamers ea­gerly await the up­com­ing bat­tle of the con­soles, here is a look back at some of my favourite games in the last seven years.</p>
    <p>SKYLANDERS</p>
    <p>2011 to 2016 PS4/Xbox One</p>
    <p>This rev­o­lu­tion­ary col­lectible game was tar­geted at kids, but adults like me were sim­i­larly en­thralled.</p>
    <p>Place the mini-fig­urine of your favourite Sky­lan­der hero on a “Por­tal of Power”, which reads the NFC chip in the fig­urine and im­ports the char­ac­ter into the game.</p>
    <p>Level up your char­ac­ter in-game and its stats are saved into the fig­urine, ready for you to take to your friend’s home to chal­lenge his favourite Sky­lan­der.</p>
    <p>The first ver­sion of the fran­chise started in 2011 in the pre­vi­ous con­sole gen­er­a­tion, but its suc­cess spilled over to the PS4 and Xbox One era, with six dif­fer­ent ver­sions re­leased be­tween 2011 and 2016.</p>
    <p>I still have more than 100 mini-fig­urines stored in a chest at home. The mem­o­ries of play­ing Skylanders with my kids, how­ever, are for­ever etched in my mind.</p>
    <p>GHOST OF TSUSHIMA</p>
    <p>2020 PS4</p>
    <p>Pos­si­bly the last PS4 game to be pub­lished by Sony’s own game stu­dios, this sa­mu­rai ac­tion game has all the el­e­ments of a heroic epic ad­ven­ture.</p>
    <p>It is premised on the 13th-cen­tury Mon­gol in­va­sion of Ja­pan. You play the role of Jin Sakai, a sa­mu­rai who watches as the vi­cious Mon­gols cut down the sa­mu­rai war­riors like but­ter. You barely es­cape as the sole sur­vivor of the first in­va­sion and seek vengeance – and save your un­cle, who has been cap­tured by the evil Kho­tun Khan.</p>
    <p>With vi­su­als of breath­tak­ing land­scapes, English-sub­ti­tled Ja­panese voice act­ing, bru­tal com­bat com­bos, and even a spe­cial Akira Kuro­sawa mode where you play in black and white, this, for me, is the best pos­si­ble way to end the cur­rent reign of the PS4 gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>DES­TINY</p>
    <p>2014 PS4/Xbox One</p>
    <p>The Xbox-ex­clu­sive Halo fran­chise ruled the shooter genre on con­soles be­cause it was fine-tuned to the con­sole-game con­troller, which is less pre­cise than the PC mouse.</p>
    <p>That is, un­til Bungie – the game stu­dio be­hind Halo – left Mi­crosoft and launched Des­tiny, a new shooter fran­chise avail­able on both con­soles.</p>
    <p>Des­tiny en­abled PlayS­ta­tion fans to fi­nally un­der­stand why Halo was such a big deal and many gamers on both plat­forms were hooked.</p>
    <p>With three dif­fer­ent classes, a gazil­lion guns and tac­tics to choose from, tight shoot­ing con­trols and the abil­ity to team up with friends on epic quests, Des­tiny was the new World Of War­craft – ex­cept it came with guns and space­ships in­stead of swords and spells.</p>
    <p>THE WITCHER 3: WILD HUNT</p>
    <p>2015 PS4/Xbox One</p>
    <p>Based on the nov­els by Pol­ish au­thor An­drzej Sap­kowski, The Witcher is one of the most suc­cess­ful game fran­chises in the world – more than 50 mil­lion copies have been sold glob­ally and it has a Net­flix se­ries (star­ring Hol­ly­wood A-lis­ter Henry Cav­ill) to its name.</p>
    <p>The fran­chise fol­lows the ad­ven­ture of Ger­alt, a beast- and mon­ster-slay­ing mer­ce­nary who is mis­un­der­stood by the very hu­mans he seeks to pro­tect.</p>
    <p>The nov­els were largely un­known to read­ers out­side Poland and East­ern Europe un­til the first Witcher game launched in 2007 to much fan­fare.</p>
    <p>The Witcher 3 was a sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ment from its pre­de­ces­sors in terms of game­play, graphics and plot.</p>
    <p>I had hun­dreds of hours of fun rid­ing Roach the horse while killing mon­sters and travers­ing a vast uni­verse of vary­ing ter­rain and towns.</p>
    <p>GOD OF WAR</p>
    <p>2018 PS4</p>
    <p>This is the best game of the cur­rent con­sole gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Kratos re­turns af­ter eight years – the last God Of War game was in 2010 – as an older and more thought­ful hero who now has a son, Atreus, to look af­ter.</p>
    <p>His rag­ing fury is now more con­trolled and the game shifts from its de­bauched and vi­o­lent roots to a movie-like ad­ven­ture of epic pro­por­tions.</p>
    <p>The heart-stop­ping com­bat gets even bet­ter, but that is not the only name of the game. Kratos must deal with his in­ner demons as he is forced to be­come a father to his child af­ter the death of his wife.</p>
    <p>With breath­tak­ing views, master­ful com­bat and an epic story, this God Of War is not quite like those of the past. It is much bet­ter.</p>
    <p>And with its se­quel, Rag­narok, just an­nounced for the up­com­ing PS5, this is just the be­gin­ning of an­other amaz­ing fran­chise.</p>
