    <p>I em­pathise with Fo­rum con­trib­u­tor Amanda Ruiqing Flynn whose seem­ingly sim­ple task of get­ting a re­fund for a car­ton of bad milk turned out to be a much more un­pleas­ant encounter than she had ex­pected (Sim­pler re­fund process needed at FairPrice stores, Sept 4).</p>
    <p>It makes no sense for Ms Flynn to have to make a long trip to the out­let where she bought the faulty item to claim a re­fund when she could have done so at an out­let nearby.</p>
    <p>This is a man­age­ment prob­lem which stems from a lack of staff em­pow­er­ment, mean­ing em­ploy­ees are not pro­vided with suf­fi­cient au­ton­omy to make de­ci­sions in their day-to-day op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>In de­vel­oped coun­tries, su­per­mar­ket staff of all lev­els are given the au­thor­ity to take care of cus­tomer needs, in­clud­ing re­funds or ex­change of mer­chan­dise.</p>
    <p>But this is of­ten not the case in Sin­ga­pore be­cause em­ploy­ees here want to play safe by try­ing to do things by the book. As a re­sult, they have no lee­way to help the cus­tomers the way they want.</p>
    <p>Noth­ing is more frus­trat­ing when deal­ing with cus­tomer is­sues than to con­stantly have to re­fer to an­other per­son on the chain of com­mand.</p>
    <p>Su­per­mar­ket op­er­a­tors must view em­ployee em­pow­er­ment as an im­por­tant man­age­ment tool which al­lows staff to carry out their daily sim­ple tasks as they think best.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees who are pas­sion­ate about their re­spon­si­bil­i­ties will go the ex­tra mile and make more of an ef­fort – this could be through the level of ser­vice they pro­vide to cus­tomers.</p>
