    <p>So many stay­cays, so lit­tle time. What makes this ho­tel spe­cial?</p>
    <p>What is it like to live among Sin­ga­pore’s wealth­i­est, where back­yards over­look golf cour­ses or the Sin­ga­pore Strait, and own­ing mul­ti­ple cars and a plea­sure craft is de rigueur? I will likely never know.</p>
    <p>But for one glo­ri­ous night, I get a glimpse of the high life at W Sin­ga­pore – Sen­tosa Cove, where the pri­vate pool on the bal­cony of my Fan­tas­tic Suite af­fords a front-row view of gleam­ing white yachts docked at One°15 Ma­rina Sen­tosa Cove.</p>
    <p>The suite is sprawl­ing, a study in in­dul­gence. A spa­cious liv­ing area opens up to a daybed on the bal­cony, large enough for two.</p>
    <p>Plush bathrobes hang in the walkin closet. There is no need to tus­sle over counter space or tow­els in the ca­pa­cious bath­room, where one can soak in the bath­tub while chan­nel surf­ing on a sleek mir­ror TV.</p>
    <p>First im­pres­sions?</p>
    <p>Mod­ern trop­i­cal decor, but made fancy. Flo­ral mo­tifs re­cur in the form of il­lu­mi­nated bean sprout­like stalks that line a red car­pet at the ho­tel’s en­trance.</p>
    <p>The check-in counter is back­dropped by a mod­ern flo­ral de­sign, in­spired by Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional flower, the Vanda Miss Joaquim. My suite sports metal­lic flo­ral wall art in the bed­room and liv­ing room.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel de­scribes the theme as “Glow­ing Jun­gle”, de­signed by ar­chi­tec­tural firm WATG in col­lab­o­ra­tion with W Ho­tels World­wide’s ap­pointed in­te­rior de­sign firm Rock­well Group.</p>
    <p>Other eclec­tic touches ap­pear in sur­pris­ing places.</p>
    <p>Black feath­ers hang off a bed­side lamp in my room and a pur­ple eggshaped chair is great for loung­ing.</p>
    <p>A larger-than-life candy-shaped sculp­ture do­nated by Mrs Ce­cilia Kwek, wife of the ho­tel’s owner Kwek Leng Beng, takes pride of place on the W Lawn, next to the pool.</p>
    <p>And lamps in the lobby hide cheru­bic baby faces within their lamp­shades. Cute or creepy? You de­cide.</p>
    <p>Please tell us there is a spa.</p>
    <p>There are myr­iad ways to un­wind at the Away spa, in­clud­ing a sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, warm vi­tal­ity pool and ex­pe­ri­en­tial show­ers that can blast you with the fer­vour of a trop­i­cal down­pour or Caribbean storm – com­plete with flash­ing lights to sim­u­late light­ning.</p>
    <p>The heated pool is not as warm as an onsen in Ja­pan, but is still a balm for stiff shoul­ders and tight hips, es­pe­cially when al­ter­nat­ing be­tween dips in the cooler jacuzzi.</p>
    <p>The best part? Ac­cess to the spa is free for in-house guests. Book a slot at check in.</p>
    <p>This must be the ho­tel’s bestkept se­cret, as I en­counter no other guests dur­ing my hour-long slot. There is barely enough time to lux­u­ri­ate in ev­ery sin­gle ex­pe­ri­ence, but do your best.</p>
    <p>Paid treat­ments such as mas­sages, scrubs and fa­cials are also avail­able.</p>
    <p>What’s worth in­dulging in?</p>
    <p>Make reser­va­tions at in-house restau­rant Skirt, which has a meat­cen­tric menu that in­cludes Ja­panese Tochigi A5 wagyu, a hulk­ing Iberico pork tom­a­hawk and its sig­na­ture butcher’s cut skirt steak.</p>
    <p>Or go for the graz­ing menu ($88 a per­son, min­i­mum of two din­ers) with three starters, a main and a dessert.</p>
    <p>Among the starters, an open­faced sand­wich of house­made ri­cotta – served with sugar snap peas, mint, chilli and Es­pelette pep­per on sour­dough – is a re­fresh­ing stand­out.</p>
    <p>I top up $25 to swop my skirt steak for an Aus­tralian Wagyu Sher rib­eye and am not dis­ap­pointed.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the of­fer­ings at the break­fast buf­fet are well-ex­e­cuted.</p>
    <p>The sour­dough is crisp and the poached egg oozes golden. Pan­cakes are warm and fluffy. Char kway teow is luxed up with scal­lops in­stead of cock­les. Even the pineap­ple slices from the mixed fruit plat­ter are per­fectly ripe.</p>
    <p>What else is there to do?</p>
    <p>I work off all the food with an early morn­ing jog around the ma­rina, feel­ing far away from my usual route along Be­dok Canal.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents whizz by on bi­cy­cles and for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers stop to chat while walk­ing dogs. No maltipoos and schnauzers here – in­stead, I spot hand­some dal­ma­tians, silky huskies and stately poo­dles.</p>
    <p>If you pre­fer ma­chines to tar­mac, the ho­tel has a well-equipped gym that cur­rently takes a max­i­mum of 10 guests dur­ing each hour-long slot.</p>
    <p>I also squeeze in a few laps at the pool, which is l arge by ho­tel stan­dards. A twisty metal slide is pop­u­lar with the kids and even proves thrilling for adults.</p>
    <p>“It’s faster than it looks,” ex­claims a woman, whizzing out with a shriek and a splash.</p>
    <p>Fifty peo­ple are al­lowed in the pool at one time, with an ad­di­tional 100 peo­ple on its sur­round­ing deck. Slots are two hours long dur­ing the day and no book­ings are re­quired be­tween 7pm and 9am.</p>
    <p>Ver­dict: Bliss or miss?</p>
    <p>A stay­ca­tion in th­ese times is an es­cape – a quest to be trans­ported, if not across bor­ders, then cer­tainly into a dif­fer­ent world. W Sin­ga­pore – Sen­tosa Cove of­fers just that.</p>
    <p>Go if you are a fan of the wild and whim­si­cal. Just be pre­pared to shell out for the ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Hot tip: If you are stay­ing on a week­end or pub­lic holiday, re­deem an all-ac­cess pass to Sen­tosa’s three beaches at the ho­tel concierge, which saves you the ef­fort of mak­ing reser­va­tions in ad­vance. Choose from a morn­ing or af­ter­noon pass, each of which gives you five hours of beach time.</p>
    <p>• This stay­ca­tion was hosted by the ho­tel and is part of a weekly se­ries. For more stay­ca­tion reviews, go to str.sg/SuiteLife.</p>
