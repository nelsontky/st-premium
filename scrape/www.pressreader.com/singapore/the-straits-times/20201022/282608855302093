    <p>Philip­pine-born Bri­tish singer­song­writer Beabadoobe­e found fame with the first song she wrote three years ago, a breezy acous­tic tune ti­tled Cof­fee that has since racked up more than 50 million plays on Spotify.</p>
    <p>The song blew up even more when Cana­dian rap­per Powfu in­cluded it in his track, Death Bed (Cof­fee For Your Head), which was re­leased this year and went vi­ral on Tik­Tok. It topped the mu­sic charts in sev­eral coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Here are five things to know about 20-year-old Beabadoobe­e, whose real name is Bea Kristi and who re­cently re­leased her de­but al­bum, Fake It Flow­ers.</p>
    <p>2 LOT OF HER MU­SIC IS WRIT­TEN IN HER SMALL BED­ROOM</p>
    <p>“It’s all done in this space,” she tells the South-east Asian me­dia in a Zoom con­fer­ence from her bed­room.</p>
    <p>She lives in Har­row, a town in Lon­don, with her par­ents and younger brother. The fam­ily moved from the Philip­pines to Bri­tain when Kristi was three.</p>
    <p>“It’s like the smelli­est, messi­est space ever,” she says of her bed­room. “And some­how the mu­sic comes from it, so that’s cool.”</p>
    <p>Her early mu­sic was of­ten tagged as “bed­room pop”, the term given to home-recorded mu­sic typ­i­cally marked by min­i­mal and raw pro­duc­tion, as well as lo-fi aes­thet­ics.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>HER MU­SIC IS DE­SCRIBED AS A GEN Z’S TAKE ON 90s AL­TER­NA­TIVE MU­SIC</p>
    <p>Asked about the mu­sic that in­spired the songs on Fake It Flow­ers, the singer rat­tles off a list of al­ter­na­tive rock acts from the 1990s – The Smash­ing Pump­kins, My Bloody Valen­tine, Veruca Salt, The Cardi­gans, Ju­liana Hat­field and more.</p>
    <p>“I’d al­ways put on Si­amese Dream (1993) by The Smash­ing Pump­kins or Eight Arms To Hold You (1997) by Veruca Salt and just dance,” she re­calls.</p>
    <p>“And it does some­thing to the en­dor­phins, it makes you feel con­fi­dent, even though I can’t dance for s***. And I want Fake It Flow­ers to be that al­bum for any­one.”</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>SHE FEELS OVER­WHELMED BY HER SUC­CESS</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways grown up with not a lot of at­ten­tion,” she says. “No one re­ally gave a s*** about me when I was a teenager.</p>
    <p>“So it’s crazy that some­how, my mu­sic is re­lat­able to a lot of peo­ple, espe­cially peo­ple around the world. It’s just crazy.”</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>SHE THINKS IT IS OKAY TO BE LOUD AND AN­NOY­ING</p>
    <p>The songs on Fake It Flow­ers carry the mes­sage that women can be any­thing they want to be.</p>
    <p>“I feel there’s a lot of in­ter­nalised misog­yny and we live in a very misog­y­nis­tic world,” she says.</p>
    <p>“And I feel like I get per­cep­tions of my­self as, like, a young Asian woman – that I have to act a cer­tain way, that I can’t be loud or an­noy­ing or sar­cas­tic and be my­self.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to make an al­bum for girls to lis­ten to you and be, like, ‘yeah, okay, I’m go­ing to whine, I’m go­ing to be an­noy­ing, I’m go­ing to be a b****.’”</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>HER DREAM IS TO PER­FORM IN ASIA</p>
    <p>If not for travel re­stric­tions and so­cial dis­tanc­ing, the singer would be gig­ging around Asia now. She plans to do a tour of the re­gion as soon as the pan­demic is un­der con­trol and global travel re­sumes.</p>
    <p>“It’s like my dream place. It also feels like home to me be­cause I’m from the Philip­pines and I’d be even closer to home. I’m go­ing to go whether you like it or not, I’m go­ing to see you guys.”</p>
