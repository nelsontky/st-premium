    <p>As a young of­fi­cer at the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board, Ms Low Yen Ling was asked twice to take a post­ing to the United States.</p>
    <p>Both times, she said no.</p>
    <p>The first of­fer came at a time when she and her hus­band were plan­ning to start a fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Ms Low, who spent 10 years at the agency, un­til 2011, turned down the post­ing the sec­ond time as she felt her two sons – now 15 and 13 – were too young for the move then.</p>
    <p>She said: “I do look back, but I look back with no re­grets be­cause I’m grate­ful for my chil­dren, for my fam­ily, and I’m grate­ful that the or­gan­i­sa­tion did not hold it against me.</p>
    <p>“But I won­der if it is the same at other or­gan­i­sa­tions? If a woman turns down the op­por­tu­nity twice, will she be per­ceived as not plac­ing im­por­tance on her ca­reer ad­vance­ment? And will she be de­nied more op­por­tu­ni­ties?”</p>
    <p>Ms Low, who is Min­is­ter of State for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth as well as Trade and In­dus­try, said she hopes that the re­view of women’s is­sues, an­nounced by Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam two weeks ago, will ex­plore such is­sues and more.</p>
    <p>The broad re­view – which aims to spark a mind­set change in gen­der at­ti­tudes in so­ci­ety – is spear­headed by Ms Low, as well as Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, and Education Sun</p>
    <p>Xuel­ing and Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Health Ra­hayu Mahzam.</p>
    <p>Dia­logues and dis­cus­sions will be­gin this month, and the ideas and sug­ges­tions gath­ered through the process will form the ba­sis of a White Pa­per to be tabled in Par­lia­ment in the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>Ms Low, in a wide-rang­ing ex­clu­sive in­ter­view with The Sun­day Times last Wed­nes­day, said women have made good progress in the past decades – from ac­cess to education to par­tic­i­pa­tion in the work­force, in busi­ness and in pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>How­ever, “en­trenched gen­der at­ti­tudes that call to ques­tion how women are treated, per­ceived and rep­re­sented” re­main, she added.</p>
    <p>“I think we need to ask our­selves if we have in­ad­ver­tently al­lowed tra­di­tional roles and gen­der ex­pec­ta­tions to limit the po­ten­tial of a woman.”</p>
    <p>Cit­ing her own ex­pe­ri­ence in turn­ing down overseas op­por­tu­ni­ties for fam­ily rea­sons, Ms Low said women – whether sin­gle or mar­ried, and car­ing for chil­dren or age­ing par­ents – are of­ten caught in a bind be­tween de­mands at home and at work.</p>
    <p>Many women also see them­selves as the de facto care provider in the fam­ily, and grav­i­tate to­wards the role – which is not a bad thing.</p>
    <p>But roles and ex­pec­ta­tions that come from such en­trenched gen­der at­ti­tudes need to be re-ex­am­ined and per­haps re­cal­i­brated as the pop­u­la­tion ages rapidly and fam­ily sizes shrink, Ms Low said.</p>
    <p>“The load for car­ing for our par­ents and some age­ing rel­a­tives who may be sin­gle will fall heav­ily on fewer shoul­ders.”</p>
    <p>On the plus side, she has seen more fa­thers em­brace par­ent­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“If we can en­cour­age more fa­thers to do this, I think it will give real choices, op­tions and op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore women to max­imise their po­ten­tial. It’s not a zero-sum game.”</p>
    <p>En­trenched gen­der bi­ases also cut both ways, said Ms Low.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, do Sin­ga­pore­ans make judg­ments about hands-on, nappy-chang­ing dads?</p>
    <p>It may be time to re-ex­am­ine these at­ti­tudes as well.</p>
    <p>Ms Low said her two role mod­els are her mother, 68, and her late ma­ter­nal grand­mother – both strong, re­silient women who jug­gled work and car­ing for the chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She lived with her grand­mother from when she was a month-old in­fant un­til she was about six, and would look for­ward to week­end vis­its from her par­ents – who worked long hours to pay off debts.</p>
    <p>One day, when her par­ents were leav­ing, she pushed a stool to the win­dow and stood on it to wave good­bye to them.</p>
    <p>“When my grandma saw that, she re­ally had a scare, and said it was time for me to go home.”</p>
    <p>Her grand­mother taught her how im­por­tant it is for work­ing women to have a strong sup­port net­work.</p>
    <p>Ms Low is grate­ful for her own sup­port struc­tures – her hus­band, mother and do­mes­tic helper, who have held the fort at home since she entered pol­i­tics in 2011.</p>
    <p>She wants more men and em­ploy­ers to par­tic­i­pate in the con­ver­sa­tions on the re­view to tackle key is­sues that hold back women.</p>
    <p>The dis­cus­sions, she hopes, will also deal with find­ing ways to put an end to stereo­types about women, such as the idea that they are not suited for cer­tain tasks or that they are not ag­gres­sive enough at work or tend to be too emo­tional.</p>
    <p>It is also time to bust stereo­types in­volv­ing men – for ex­am­ple, the no­tion that they should not take parental leave.</p>
    <p>She said: “If we can op­ti­mise the full po­ten­tial of ev­ery­one in Sin­ga­pore – Sin­ga­porean men and women, boys and girls – our en­tire so­ci­ety will ben­e­fit.”</p>
    <p>I do look back, but I look back with no re­grets be­cause I’m grate­ful for my chil­dren, for my fam­ily, and I’m grate­ful that the or­gan­i­sa­tion did not hold it against me. But I won­der if it is the same at other or­gan­i­sa­tions?</p>
