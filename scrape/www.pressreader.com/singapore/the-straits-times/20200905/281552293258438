    <p>The Mit­suoka Rock Star – styled af­ter the Chevro­let Corvette C2 – is a head-turn­ing beauty. Boast­ing ex­quis­ite de­tail­ing, the 1.5-litre au­to­matic is not a fast car, but it does not have to be fast to feel fast. The plucky and zesty en­gine lives for revs, and when se­cond gear takes you to about 90kmh, you will feel its vo­ra­cious ap­petite.</p>
    <p>Within an hour of zip­ping off in the Mit­suoka Rock Star, I re­ceive two thumbs-ups by pass­ing mo­torists and count­less huge grins, and en­gage in con­ver­sa­tion with three strangers.</p>
    <p>This Mazda MX-5-based stunner turns more heads than a Fer­rari or Lam­borgh­ini. Un­like rides from those two mar­ques, which can draw the wrong at­ten­tion, the Mit­suoka at­tracts only good­will – ev­ery­body’s happy to see you.</p>
    <p>This is no sur­prise. Mit­suoka is known for wacky cars such as the ser­pen­tine Orochi and vin­tage Mercedes-in­spired SSK.</p>
    <p>The small Japanese coach­builder of­ten wraps clas­sic car-ap­ing bod­ies around vol­ume cars. Its creations have al­ways been de­tailed enough to be recog­nis­able, yet suf­fi­ciently play­ful that the world knows it does not take it­self too se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>The Rock Star – styled af­ter the grace­ful Chevro­let Corvette C2 – is the first Mit­suoka which I feel is le­git­i­mately beau­ti­ful.</p>
    <p>Days af­ter tak­ing cus­tody of the car, I am still smit­ten by how pretty it is. Even catch­ing a glimpse of its shark nose pok­ing out from be­hind a pil­lar makes me eu­phoric.</p>
    <p>The de­tail­ing is, as you would expect from a fas­tid­i­ous coach­builder, ex­quis­ite. Sure, the vents are fake, but they are so stun­ningly ren­dered, you for­get they are not real.</p>
    <p>In­side the car, it is pure Mazda. The in­fo­tain­ment sys­tem does not get a re­skin, al­though leather in­serts on the dash and door cards add a wel­come pop of colour and verve.</p>
    <p>The sense of oc­ca­sion is, how­ever, not lost. The MX-5 has al­ways been a ride that en­deav­ours to make you feel out­side of it, es­pe­cially with the roof down.</p>
    <p>The top of the doors goes seam­lessly from the front wings and is painted in body colour, and the haunches are al­ways vis­i­ble.</p>
    <p>The Rock Star is a 1.5-litre au­to­matic, a vari­ant of the MX-5 that is not of­fi­cially im­ported here. It is not a fast car. And at 1,140kg, it is 7.5 per cent heav­ier than the MX-5.</p>
    <p>With a blue-la­belled Toy­ota Prius next to me, I set off from the lights – en­gine and ex­haust buzzing like a swarm of bees as the tachome­ter hits 7,500rpm.</p>
    <p>I look to the left and the pri­vate­hire car is still there. But the Rock Star does not have to be fast to feel fast. Driven at a brisk Prius pace, ev­ery last drop of its me­chan­i­cal rich­ness can be savoured.</p>
    <p>I can see why Mazda harps on how the weaker 1.5-litre unit is the spir­i­tual cen­tre of the MX-5 range. The plucky and zesty en­gine lives for revs and when the se­cond gear takes you only to about 90kmh, you will feel its vo­ra­cious ap­petite. Turns are nav­i­gated deftly.</p>
    <p>With the sun dip­ping be­neath the hori­zon, I sit at a wa­ter­side cafe sip­ping a cool drink – still drunk on the beauty and sheer ge­nius of this Japanese ride.</p>
