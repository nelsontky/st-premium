    <p>Chi­nese views on the United States have changed un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion and may do so again af­ter the US elec­tions. In the first of a new col­umn that ex­am­ines the var­i­ous facets of US-China ri­valry, China cor­re­spon­dent Dan­son Cheong looks at why Amer­i­can vot­ers are key to ties be­tween the two su­per­pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Last year, ed­u­ca­tion agent Chen Hua helped send 150 Chi­nese stu­dents to the United States for post-grad­u­ate stud­ies.</p>
    <p>This year, that fig­ure has come down to zero.</p>
    <p>For Ms Chen, who has been help­ing Chi­nese stu­dents en­rol in Amer­i­can uni­ver­si­ties for 20 years, the change is stark. “You can say (the num­bers) have fallen off a cliff,” said Ms Chen, 45, the gen­eral man­ager of a study-abroad agency.</p>
    <p>Re­la­tions be­tween the US and China are at their low­est point in decades and Chi­nese stu­dents are one of the lat­est ca­su­al­ties.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, Wash­ing­ton said it had re­voked the visas of more than 1,000 Chi­nese stu­dents and re­searchers over sus­pi­cions that their in­sti­tu­tions had links to the Chi­nese mil­i­tary – un­der an or­der that US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is­sued in May.</p>
    <p>It was one more vol­ley in what is be­ing seen here as a near daily bar­rage of anti-China at­tacks by the US gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese me­dia has also stoked fear with re­ports of racist at­tacks against eth­nic Chi­nese in Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Now, Chi­nese stu­dents – and their par­ents – are re­con­sid­er­ing whether the US is the best choice for their fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion be­ing asked is whether this could mark the be­gin­ning of a sea change. Are th­ese at­ti­tudes among stu­dents and par­ents em­blem­atic of a larger shift in public sen­ti­ment in China?</p>
    <p>Some ob­servers have no­ticed this hap­pen­ing since Mr Trump was elected in 2016, a trend which looks to have ac­cel­er­ated over the last few months.</p>
    <p>Just a cur­sory look on Chi­nese so­cial me­dia plat­forms will show that anti-Amer­i­can views dom­i­nate.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, af­ter a se­nior Chi­nese of­fi­cial said last Fri­day that it was im­pos­si­ble for the US and China to com­pletely de­cou­ple, one of the top posts on the is­sue on mi­croblog­ging site Weibo was that Amer­ica was seek­ing de­cou­pling to put pres­sure on Chi­nese tech­no­log­i­cal progress.</p>
    <p>While this might be partly be­cause gov­ern­ment cen­sors sup­press con­trar­ian views while pro­mot­ing pro-party ones – some Chi­nese so­cial me­dia watch­ers, like</p>
    <p>Ms Manya Koetse, say they have in­creas­ingly no­ticed what seems to be a groundswel­l of un­hap­pi­ness with the US.</p>
    <p>Ms Koetse, who runs What’s On Weibo, a news site that watches trends on Chi­nese so­cial me­dia, pointed out that when Mr Trump was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 early last month, Weibo ex­ploded with de­ri­sive com­ments, with ne­ti­zens say­ing this was a “Na­tional Day gift to China” and shap­ing the dis­cus­sions over the is­sue. China’s Na­tional Day is on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>“From early 2019, per­haps th­ese anti-Amer­i­can sen­ti­ments were fu­elled by state me­dia. But now I’m see­ing that it has be­come a so­cial me­dia move­ment in it­self, not nec­es­sar­ily shaped by of­fi­cial state me­dia nar­ra­tives,” she said.</p>
    <p>WHAT’S DRIV­ING THE ES­TRANGE­MENT?</p>
    <p>There are three rea­sons why this shift could be hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>First, when Mr Trump first took of­fice, many Chi­nese viewed him pos­i­tively as a prag­matic busi­ness­man who es­chewed po­lit­i­cal cor­rect­ness.</p>
    <p>But in the years since, he has launched a trade war against China, sanc­tioned its tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies, and slapped visa and im­mi­gra­tion re­stric­tions on the Chi­nese over is­sues re­lat­ing to es­pi­onage, Hong Kong or Xin­jiang, or for be­ing Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party mem­bers.</p>
    <p>“Since the start of the trade war, the nar­ra­tive be­tween the two coun­tries has been get­ting very neg­a­tive, al­most ev­ery week you’d hear of some sanc­tions from the US,” said Dr Wang Huiyao, an ad­viser to China’s Cabi­net and founder of the Cen­tre for China and Glob­al­i­sa­tion think-tank.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has also blamed China for mis­han­dling the Covid-19 out­break, call­ing it the “Chi­nese virus”.</p>
    <p>Se­cond, Beijing has been turn­ing up the dial on anti-Amer­i­can na­tion­al­ism.</p>
    <p>Most re­cently, when the coun­try com­mem­o­rated the</p>
    <p>70th an­niver­sary of the Korean War, known in China as the war to re­sist US ag­gres­sion and aid Korea, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping un­veiled a new ex­hibit in a Beijing mu­seum ex­tolling China’s role in help­ing fight off Amer­i­can forces.</p>
    <p>Days later, he de­liv­ered a speech clearly di­rected at the US, where he said China would not back down against any in­vad­ing force.</p>
    <p>The wave of pro­pa­ganda in­cluded ac­tion thriller</p>
    <p>Sac­ri­fice, a story de­pict­ing Chi­nese troops hold­ing off US forces in the last days of the war that starred Wolf</p>
    <p>War­rior film star Wu</p>
    <p>Jing.</p>
    <p>Lastly, the Covid-19 pan­demic has also fed na­tional pride in China’s grow­ing strength.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 hap­pened here first, but it’s also the place where the sit­u­a­tion is most un­der con­trol. Peo­ple look at other West­ern coun­tries and see how it’s a mess,” said Beijing-based po­lit­i­cal ob­server Hu Xing­dou.</p>
    <p>China has man­aged to put a lid on the virus, af­ford­ing peo­ple here free­doms un­think­able in other parts of the world. Dur­ing the Na­tional Day hol­i­day last month, hun­dreds of mil­lions of peo­ple criss-crossed the coun­try in a travel blitz.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese me­dia has also had a hand in di­rect­ing th­ese sen­ti­ments, pub­lish­ing re­ports to show how the US has bun­gled in its han­dling of the pan­demic. Each day, the of­fi­cial Peo­ple’s Daily puts out a news alert on the num­ber of new cases in Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>The fact that many Chi­nese can now lead more or less nor­mal lives has boosted con­fi­dence in their coun­try’s sys­tem of gov­er­nance, said Pro­fes­sor Hu.</p>
    <p>LOVE-HATE RE­LA­TION­SHIP</p>
    <p>Even as Chi­nese na­tion­al­ism mounts, at­ti­tudes are also hard­en­ing on the other side of the Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>A Pew Re­search Cen­tre opin­ion sur­vey last month of mainly West­ern coun­tries showed that views of China have soured in the wake of the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It also said Amer­i­can views on China have been wors­en­ing since 2018 – the lat­est sur­vey showed 73 per cent had an un­favourable view.</p>
    <p>The fear is that th­ese ten­sions will erode the pro­fes­sional, cul­tural and ed­u­ca­tional ex­changes be­tween the two coun­tries, which for a long time have formed the bal­last of the world’s most im­por­tant bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>But some ex­perts say this shift seems more an aber­ra­tion than a long-term trend, and fore­see that th­ese in­flamed sen­ti­ments could be re­versed, should Mr Joe Bi­den get elected in to­mor­row’s US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>They point out that for a long time, the US has held a spe­cial at­trac­tion for the Chi­nese, and this would not change eas­ily.</p>
    <p>There is a Chi­nese id­iom that de­scribes this fas­ci­na­tion with all things for­eign – chong yang mei wai – which means a wor­ship of for­eign things.</p>
    <p>“Since China be­gan eco­nomic re­forms, the Chi­nese have looked to the US with a kind of ad­mi­ra­tion. They ad­mire Amer­i­can cul­ture, want to go to school there or mi­grate to the US,” said Pro­fes­sor Zhou Min of the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Los An­ge­les, who is an ex­pert on mi­gra­tion and the Chi­nese di­as­pora.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can soft power has sunk deep roots in the Mid­dle King­dom – young Chi­nese grow up watch­ing Amer­i­can movies (China is Hol­ly­wood’s largest for­eign mar­ket), watch­ing Amer­i­can sports (the NBA has half a bil­lion Chi­nese fans), and con­sum­ing Amer­i­can prod­ucts (Star­bucks, iPhones, KFC).</p>
    <p>The US is also a mag­net for China’s best and bright­est.</p>
    <p>When China first be­gan open­ing up, Chi­nese leader Deng Xiaop­ing de­cided to send thou­sands of stu­dents abroad.</p>
    <p>The first 52 ci­ti­zens of the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China were sent to the US to study in 1978.</p>
    <p>Now there are about 360,000 Chi­nese stu­dents in Amer­ica, spend­ing about US$15 bil­lion (S$20 bil­lion) on tu­ition fees.</p>
    <p>Even the chil­dren of top Chi­nese lead­ers are known to study in elite US uni­ver­si­ties, in­clud­ing Mr Xi’s own daugh­ter, who went to Har­vard.</p>
    <p>For many Chi­nese, it is a com­plex love-hate re­la­tion­ship with Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>One se­nior ex­ec­u­tive for a Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy firm told me how bi­lat­eral ten­sions have cast a pall over tech de­vel­op­ers like him.</p>
    <p>He splits his time be­tween his firm’s R&D cen­tre in Sil­i­con Val­ley and Beijing, and de­scribed how his com­pany now re­quires staff like him to bring blank lap­tops and phones with them when they travel, in case they are checked by the US au­thor­i­ties and ac­cused of help­ing China steal US tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Still, if you are look­ing for tal­ent or cre­ativ­ity, Amer­ica can­not be beaten, he said. “They are more ad­vanced than us; China’s en­vi­ron­ment for in­no­va­tion is not de­vel­oped.”</p>
    <p>This is some­thing that Chi­nese lead­ers also know.</p>
    <p>In the just-con­cluded Fifth Plenum, a con­clave of Com­mu­nist Party elites, party lead­ers stressed the im­por­tance of in­no­va­tion for China to be tech­no­log­i­cally self-re­liant.</p>
    <p>But of­fi­cials also said this can­not be a closed-door pur­suit. They know that shut­ting the door on the world (and by ex­ten­sion, the US) will hob­ble this ef­fort.</p>
    <p>IS BI­DEN BET­TER FOR CHINA?</p>
    <p>On this week’s US elec­tion, the ar­gu­ments about which can­di­date Chi­nese lead­ers hope will win have been dis­cussed at great length.</p>
    <p>One ar­gu­ment is that an­other Trump term would fur­ther di­min­ish Amer­ica’s in­ter­na­tional re­pute and be good for China.</p>
    <p>But the op­pos­ing view seems to be more preva­lent – some like Dr Wang and Prof Hu, feel a Bi­den pres­i­dency would re­turn bi­lat­eral re­la­tions to a more ra­tio­nal, less volatile state. And af­ter four years of Mr Trump, Mr Xi and his co­horts might per­haps hope for the rel­a­tive sta­bil­ity that a Bi­den pres­i­dency might bring.</p>
    <p>Prof Hu of­fered the view on the street: “Many Chi­nese hope for Mr Bi­den to win. In their eyes, Mr Trump is not rea­son­able. They think if Bi­den wins, China-US re­la­tions will go back to how they were be­fore.”</p>
    <p>That might not be com­pletely pos­si­ble, since Mr Bi­den is ex­pected to also take a hard stance on China, should he be elected.</p>
    <p>Still, if Mr Bi­den wins, as polls are pre­dict­ing, Beijing would want to cre­ate as con­ducive an en­vi­ron­ment as pos­si­ble to work with the new ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The pro­pa­ganda depart­ment will no doubt cut back on anti-US pro­grammes and re­ports.</p>
    <p>Will in­flamed sen­ti­ments and anti-Amer­i­can anger cool down in China? That will de­pend on how Amer­i­cans vote to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>How to re­store con­fi­dence in US elec­tions</p>
