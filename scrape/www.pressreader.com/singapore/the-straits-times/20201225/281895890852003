    <p>TOKYO Former Ja­panese pre­mier Shinzo Abe will not be charged over al­le­ga­tions his po­lit­i­cal fund­ing group il­le­gally sub­sidised par­ties for hun­dreds of vot­ers in a case cast­ing a shadow over the cur­rent prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Tokyo pros­e­cu­tors in a state­ment yes­ter­day said that one of the former pre­mier’s aides has been sum­mar­ily in­dicted – a move that could lead to a fine of up to about US$10,000 (S$13,300) – for fail­ing to record fi­nan­cial de­tails re­lat­ing to the use of the funds.</p>
    <p>The scan­dal over the gath­er­ings held at a Tokyo ho­tel the night be­fore an an­nual pub­licly funded cherry blos­som view­ing party has tar­nished the im­age of cur­rent Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga, who served as Mr Abe’s right-hand man through­out his record term of al­most eight con­sec­u­tive years in of­fice.</p>
    <p>With less than a year to go be­fore the next elec­tion must be called, Mr Suga, who de­fended Mr Abe over the al­le­ga­tions, has seen his sup­port slump due to the scan­dal and di­min­ish­ing pub­lic con­fi­dence over his han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Voter sup­port tum­bled to 39 per cent in a De­cem­ber sur­vey by the Asahi news­pa­per, com­pared with 56 per cent a month ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe, who stepped down in Septem­ber for health rea­sons, has re­peat­edly de­nied any wrong­do­ing over the gath­er­ings. He may be sum­moned to Par­lia­ment to­day to face ques­tions over the is­sue, Kyodo News said.</p>
    <p>To­wards the end of 2019, Mr Abe faced stiff ques­tion­ing in Par­lia­ment from op­po­si­tion mem­bers over the cherry blos­som par­ties.</p>
    <p>While it is highly un­usual for a former Ja­panese prime min­is­ter to be con­victed of a crime, Kakuei Tanaka was con­victed of bribery charges in the Lock­heed case in 1983. The former pre­mier re­ceived a prison sen­tence, but died while his case was still on ap­peal.</p>
