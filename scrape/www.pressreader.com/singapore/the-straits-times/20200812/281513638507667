    <p>E-com­merce gi­ant Ama­zon has ex­panded its anti-coun­ter­feit pro­gramme Project Zero to seven more coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, as part of an on­go­ing ef­fort to fight the sale of coun­ter­feit prod­ucts on its plat­form.</p>
    <p>Brands or own­ers of trade­marks reg­is­tered in the coun­tries cov­ered by Project Zero can use a self-ser­vice tool to di­rectly re­move list­ings from Ama­zon’s on­line stores – a key fea­ture of the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“Ama­zon is com­mit­ted to pro­tect­ing our cus­tomers and the brands we col­lab­o­rate with world­wide,” Mr Dharmesh Me­hta, Ama­zon’s vice-pres­i­dent of world­wide cus­tomer trust and part­ner sup­port, said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme, launched in Fe­bru­ary last year, is now avail­able in a to­tal of 17 coun­tries, in­clud­ing the United States, Ja­pan and Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Each day, Project Zero uses ma­chine learn­ing tech­nolo­gies to scan more than five bil­lion list­ings of prod­ucts – in­clud­ing those from 10,000 reg­is­tered brands such as BMW, Pana­sonic and Sal­va­tore Fer­rag­amo – to de­tect and block coun­ter­feit ones.</p>
    <p>Brands pro­vide Ama­zon with key data points about them­selves – such as lo­gos and trade­marks – to aid in the process.</p>
    <p>An up­com­ing fea­ture, which may in­volve pay­ing a fee, al­lows brands to ap­ply unique se­rial num­bers on prod­ucts for bet­ter track­ing.</p>
    <p>It is not known when this fea­ture will be avail­able in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Project Zero has been a leap for­ward in pro­tect­ing brands, es­pe­cially for those that use all three of its com­po­nents,” said Mr Me­hta.</p>
    <p>To be el­i­gi­ble for this ser­vice, brands must have sub­mit­ted re­ports of “po­ten­tial in­fringe­ments with an ac­cep­tance rate of at least 90 per cent” in the past six months, said Ama­zon.</p>
    <p>The com­pany did not say how many coun­ter­feit list­ings it de­tects daily with Project Zero.</p>
    <p>Some ob­servers ques­tioned if the pro­gramme will give brand own­ers the power to re­move list­ings from par­al­lel im­porters.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty lawyer Koh Chia Ling said the self-ser­vice tool has the po­ten­tial to be abused by brand own­ers and has to be po­liced by Ama­zon. “Law­fully mod­i­fied par­al­lel im­ports may also be the sub­ject of com­plaints by brand own­ers. The self-help sys­tem might tilt in favour of brand own­ers in this re­gard.”</p>
    <p>He added that Project Zero is likely to speed up the process for trade­mark own­ers to pro­tect their rights, but the av­er­age con­sumer may not no­tice much of a dif­fer­ence im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon says on its web­site that brands must main­tain an ac­cu­racy rat­ing of at least 99 per cent when us­ing the self-ser­vice re­moval tool in or­der to main­tain their Project Zero priv­i­leges. But it is not clear how ac­cu­racy is de­ter­mined.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the 2018 Global Brand Coun­ter­feit­ing Re­port, global sales of coun­ter­feits are pro­jected to reach US$1.82 tril­lion (S$2.5 tril­lion) this year, with ecom­merce ac­count­ing for a quar­ter of that num­ber.</p>
    <p>Project Zero’s ex­pan­sion fol­lows Ama­zon’s es­tab­lish­ment of a Coun­ter­feit Crimes Unit in June to work with law en­force­ment of­fi­cials to lo­cate and pros­e­cute coun­ter­feit­ers.</p>
    <p>NEED FOR POLIC­ING</p>
    <p>Law­fully mod­i­fied par­al­lel im­ports may also be the sub­ject of com­plaints by brand own­ers. The self-help sys­tem might tilt in favour of brand own­ers in this re­gard. ’’</p>
    <p>TECH­NOL­OGY AND IN­TEL­LEC­TUAL PROP­ERTY LAWYER KOH CHIA LING, say­ing the self-ser­vice tool has the po­ten­tial to be abused by brand own­ers and has to be po­liced by Ama­zon.</p>
