    <p>BER­LIN • Euro­pean Union lead­ers told Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping yes­ter­day to speed up ne­go­ti­a­tions to con­clude a China-EU in­vest­ment deal, Ger­man Chan­cel­lor Angela Merkel said, adding that com­pe­ti­tion with China must be fair.</p>
    <p>“We put on pres­sure... to make progress on the in­vest­ment agree­ment,” Dr Merkel told re­porters, after a video sum­mit with Mr Xi.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, co­op­er­a­tion with China must be based on cer­tain prin­ci­ples – rec­i­proc­ity, fair com­pe­ti­tion. We are dif­fer­ent so­cial sys­tems, but while we are com­mit­ted to mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, it must be rules-based,” she added.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel joined EU sum­mit chair Charles Michel and Euro­pean Com­mis­sion chief Ur­sula von der Leyen in the video con­fer­ence with Mr Xi.</p>
    <p>“In the last 15 years, China has be­come much stronger eco­nom­i­cally and this means that the de­mand for rec­i­proc­ity – for a level play­ing field – is of course very jus­ti­fied to­day,” Dr Merkel said.</p>
    <p>The EU and China have been in ne­go­ti­a­tions since 2013 on a bi­lat­eral pact that would re­duce Chi­nese re­stric­tions on Euro­pean com­pa­nies. In April last year, the EU and China set a tar­get date of the end of this year for reach­ing an “am­bi­tious” in­vest­ment deal.</p>
    <p>EU-China re­la­tions have been strained this year by is­sues such as the al­leged Chi­nese dis­in­for­ma­tion about the coro­n­avirus, Bei­jing’s con­tro­ver­sial na­tional se­cu­rity l aw for Hong Kong and stepped-up Euro­pean ef­forts to pro­tect domestic man­u­fac­tur­ers from for­eign com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>The EU also wants stronger com­mit­ments on cli­mate change from China, the world’s top pol­luter.</p>
    <p>Still, the bloc is keen to show eco­nomic re­wards from a pol­icy ap­proach to­wards China that is less con­fronta­tional than that pur­sued by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The EU ar­gues that the global eco­nomic slump trig­gered by the coro­n­avirus strength­ens the case for an ac­cord that would open the Chi­nese mar­ket more to for­eign in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the online sum­mit yes­ter­day, the EU and China had signed a deal to pro­tect each other’s exported food and drinks items from feta cheese to Pix­ian bean paste.</p>
    <p>The two sides will re­spect the names of 100 Euro­pean re­gional food des­ig­na­tions and 100 Chi­nese equiv­a­lents, mean­ing for ex­am­ple that China will al­low “cham­pagne” to be used only for sparkling wine from the French re­gion of that name.</p>
    <p>China was the third-largest des­ti­na­tion for EU agri­cul­tural and food prod­ucts last year, worth €14.5 bil­lion (S$23.5 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The new deal is a trade coup for Europe as pro­duc­ers from the United States, Aus­tralia and New Zealand will no longer be able to use the pro­tected names on their ex­ports to China, al­though there is a tran­si­tion pe­riod for cer­tain cheeses.</p>
