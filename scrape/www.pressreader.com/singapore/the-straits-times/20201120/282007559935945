    <p>During the cir­cuit breaker, there were many chal­lenges to fa­cil­i­tate the en­try of for­eign do­mes­tic workers (FDWs) into Sin­ga­pore (Al­low maids an eas­ier re­turn to Sin­ga­pore on case-by-case ba­sis, Nov 17). There were only re­lief flights, or none, in and out of Sin­ga­pore, and en­try ap­provals for FDWs were scarce.</p>
    <p>How­ever, grad­u­ally, during phases one and two, the re­stric­tions have been re­laxed, and, over the last few weeks, ap­pli­ca­tions for both in-prin­ci­ple ap­proval and en­try ap­proval have been pro­cessed faster.</p>
    <p>FDWs have to take the poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test at source be­fore they re­turn to Sin­ga­pore, though it might be oner­ous for an FDW to han­dle these pro­cesses on her own.</p>
    <p>This is a re­quire­ment that em­ploy­ment agen­cies wel­come as it re­duces the risk of im­port­ing pos­i­tive cases into Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>It also re­duces the risk of in­con­ve­nience to FDWs and em­ploy­ers as they can avoid the pro­longed wait for an in­fected maid to re­cover.</p>
    <p>An em­ployer should con­sider con­tact­ing an em­ploy­ment agency in Sin­ga­pore, or the FDW might want to ap­proach a li­censed re­cruit­ment agency in the source coun­try to guide her through the pro­cesses to en­sure a smooth ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and to serve the stay-home no­tice (SHN).</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should also en­sure that they un­der­stand the SHN re­quire­ment, re­lated cost and their and the maid’s re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>An em­ployer may want to con­sider other op­tions avail­able in Sin­ga­pore to pro­vide care for their loved ones if they have concerns about the cost of bring­ing in an FDW from over­seas.</p>
