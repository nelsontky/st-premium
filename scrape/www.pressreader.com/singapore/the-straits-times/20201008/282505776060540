    <p>THE HAUNT­ING OF BLY MANOR</p>
    <p>One of the de­lights of hor­ror sto­ries is that you kind of know what’s com­ing.</p>
    <p>On screen, this is be­cause you’ve in­ter­nalised the cin­e­matic vo­cab­u­lary, from the tim­ing of jump scares to the sub­tle peck­ing or­der that de­ter­mines who will die first.</p>
    <p>Hor­ror writ­ers and di­rec­tors speak this lan­guage flu­ently, but the gifted ones are able to also remix those pleas­ing old tropes just so, as creator Mike Flana­gan did in The Haunt­ing Of Hill House (2018).</p>
    <p>Based on the ac­claimed novel by Shirley Jack­son, it was as much a fam­ily psy­chother­apy ses­sion as a hor­ror yarn, and cal­i­brated for max­i­mum fright and pathos.</p>
    <p>He has re­assem­bled some of the same play­ers for the fol­low-up, The Haunt­ing Of Bly Manor – an adap­ta­tion of The Turn Of The Screw, Henry James’ Gothic hor­ror novella about a gov­erness who be­lieves the es­tate where she and her charges live is haunted – al­though it may all be in her head.</p>
    <p>In this ver­sion, Vic­to­ria Pe­dretti is Dani, a young Amer­i­can hired by po-faced English­man Henry Win­grave (Henry Thomas) to look af­ter his or­phaned niece Flora (Amelie Bea Smith) and nephew Miles (Ben­jamin Evan Ainsworth) af­ter their pre­vi­ous nanny dies un­der murky cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>No one wants the job be­cause the fam­ily seems cursed, but Dani takes it be­cause she is haunted by her own demons – in­clud­ing one that com­pels her to cover up all the mir­rors in her bed­room.</p>
    <p>But Dani’s ghosts are noth­ing com­pared with the ones that haunt Bly Manor, the grand old es­tate where she and the chil­dren live, the walls of which drip with ter­ri­fy­ing se­crets.</p>
    <p>Flana­gan has ex­panded his Great­est Hits playlist of hor­ror tropes for this lat­est haunted-house romp: chil­dren who know and see things adults don’t, creepy dolls and a beau­ti­ful, vul­ner­a­ble young woman.</p>
    <p>Other tropes he loves are ones that scream 1980s English­ness, so ex­pect chunky wool sweaters and char­ac­ters who say “splen­did” and “dread­ful” a lot.</p>
    <p>The idea of the su­per­nat­u­ral as an ex­pres­sion of pain and trauma isn’t new, nor is us­ing a creaky old house to il­lus­trate that.</p>
    <p>But the se­ries is so well put to­gether that, re­cy­cled or not, it all works seam­lessly.</p>
    <p>Flana­gan is also a master when it comes to the off-kil­ter fram­ing of a shot – or a gaze over the shoul­der at some­one or some­thing which shouldn’t be there. It is both ter­ri­fy­ing and a joy to watch.</p>
    <p>TEHRAN</p>
    <p>Tehran is an­other show that ef­fec­tively remixes an over­worked sub-genre – in this case, the es­pi­onage thriller.</p>
    <p>Cre­ated by Moshe Zon­der – the writer be­hind ac­claimed Is­raeli spy show Fauda (2015 to present) – it fol­lows Ta­mar (Niv Sul­tan), a Mos­sad hacker who sneaks into the Ira­nian cap­i­tal to take out a power grid and pave the way for an Is­raeli air at­tack.</p>
    <p>When things go awry, she de­cides to go rogue, which means fend­ing for her­self in a coun­try that is not ex­actly friendly to­wards Is­rael.</p>
    <p>Hot on her heels are crack Ira­nian in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cer Faraz (Shaun Toub) and her lo­cal han­dler, Ma­soud (Navid Ne­gah­ban), whom Ta­mar no longer trusts.</p>
    <p>Zon­der has been crit­i­cised for over­sim­pli­fy­ing the geopol­i­tics of Iran-Is­rael hos­til­i­ties and look­ing at the lat­ter’s in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity through rose-tinted glasses.</p>
    <p>But he de­serves credit for at least at­tempt­ing a non-mono­lithic por­trayal of Ira­nian so­ci­ety, which is also seen through the eyes of a pro­tag­o­nist with roots in the coun­try her­self.</p>
    <p>Above all, Zon­der knows how to write a grip­ping, edge-of-your-seat thriller and you will gladly sus­pend your dis­be­lief.</p>
    <p>The first episode is a textbook ex­am­ple of how to jump-start a spy show and is worth a watch even if you don’t care for the pol­i­tics.</p>
