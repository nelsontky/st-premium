    <p>Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP)</p>
    <p>The PAP held daily talk shows dur­ing the cam­paign pe­riod.</p>
    <p>These shows, which were streamed on Face­book, were cen­tred on pol­icy is­sues such as jobs, im­prov­ing pub­lic hous­ing and sup­port for the vul­ner­a­ble. PAP can­di­dates ad­dressed chal­lenges faced by Sin­ga­pore­ans in these ar­eas and how the party is work­ing to help them.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, the party’s sec­re­tary-gen­eral, held his trade­mark lunchtime rally on­line. The var­i­ous PAP teams also held e-ral­lies where they de­tailed fu­ture plans for their con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>Video clips of new can­di­dates’ in­tro­duc­tory speeches at press con­fer­ences were up­loaded and shared on­line as well.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party (WP)</p>
    <p>Be­fore Nom­i­na­tion Day, the WP re­leased a silent teaser video which un­veiled some of its new can­di­dates for the first time.</p>
    <p>It also held a talk show – called the Ham­mer Show – al­most every night. Episodes of the show delved into is­sues such as the chal­lenges faced by young peo­ple, sup­port for se­niors, as well as pol­icy pro­pos­als from the WP on mat­ters like en­sur­ing eco­nomic sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>The WP also pro­duced videos fea­tur­ing can­di­dates in more re­laxed set­tings. For­mer WP chief Low Thia Khi­ang de­liv­ered his trade­mark Teochew rally speech on video.</p>
    <p>Progress Sin­ga­pore Party (PSP)</p>
    <p>PSP chief Tan Cheng Bock built up a sig­nif­i­cant fol­low­ing on In­sta­gram by mak­ing an ef­fort to learn and use slang terms favoured by mil­len­ni­als.</p>
    <p>He also in­vited fol­low­ers to send him con­tent, which he then shared on his own In­sta­gram page.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to e-ral­lies and talk shows that fea­tured its can­di­dates, the PSP pro­duced videos that were crit­i­cal of is­sues such as Sin­ga­pore’s em­ploy­ment pol­icy, in­clud­ing a skit that fea­tured the use of di­alect.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party (SDP)</p>
    <p>The SDP took part in “AskMeAny­thing” ses­sions on In­ter­net fo­rum Red­dit, where mem­bers took ques­tions posed to them by ne­ti­zens. These in­cluded ques­tions on the Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act, and why the SDP pro­posed in­tro­duc­ing a cap­i­tal gains tax.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to on­line ral­lies, the party recorded videos that hit back at the PAP’s crit­i­cism of the SDP.</p>
    <p>Party chief Chee Soon Juan also had reg­u­lar broad­casts of his walk­a­bouts on Face­book Live.</p>
    <p>Other op­po­si­tion par­ties</p>
    <p>Par­ties such as Peo­ples Voice, Na­tional Sol­i­dar­ity Party, Red Dot United, Peo­ple’s Power Party and Re­form Party held e-ral­lies or Face­book Live ses­sions where can­di­dates de­tailed their plans to ad­dress lo­cal is­sues, or to re­form na­tional poli­cies.</p>
