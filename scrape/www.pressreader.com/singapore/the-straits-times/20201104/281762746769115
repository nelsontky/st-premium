    <p>There will be ar­range­ments to help se­niors re­deem and use their dig­i­tal Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers worth $100 when the scheme be­gins next month.</p>
    <p>These in­clude set­ting up coun­ters at com­mu­nity cen­tres to help them in mak­ing book­ings, and or­gan­is­ing small group tours for them, said Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Alvin Tan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas) and Mr Ang Wei Neng (West Coast GRC) on the help that will be given to se­niors in util­is­ing the vouch­ers, which can be spent on lo­cal at­trac­tions, ho­tels as well as tours, and are meant to re­vive do­mes­tic tourism.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 18 and above can re­deem the vouch­ers from Dec 1 via SingPass. They are valid till the end of June next year.</p>
    <p>Book­ing plat­forms for the vouch­ers – Klook Travel Tech­nol­ogy, UOB Travel Plan­ners, Changi Travel Ser­vices and Glob­alTix – will set up phys­i­cal coun­ters to as­sist se­niors.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) is work­ing with the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion (PA) to set them up at</p>
    <p>com­mu­nity cen­tres, with each Hous­ing Board town hav­ing at least one. Up to 66 coun­ters will be set up is­land­wide.</p>
    <p>Se­niors can go to the coun­ters, where am­bas­sadors will help them</p>
    <p>make their re­demp­tions and pur­chases, Mr Tan added.</p>
    <p>STB will also set up a hotline to han­dle public in­quiries.</p>
    <p>“To help se­niors who are stay­ing alone or have lit­tle so­cial sup­port to</p>
    <p>use their vouch­ers, STB will ex­plore work­ing with so­cial ser­vice or­gan­i­sa­tions and PA to fa­cil­i­tate the us­age of the vouch­ers, such as by or­gan­is­ing small group tours for se­niors when per­mis­si­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that the vouch­ers’ va­lid­ity pe­riod cov­ers the De­cem­ber, March and June school hol­i­days, and the off-peak pe­ri­ods in be­tween would be suit­able for se­niors or those who are not work­ing to use them.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing se­cu­rity con­cerns, Mr Tan said STB is work­ing with the rel­e­vant gov­ern­ment agen­cies and book­ing plat­forms to de­velop safe­guards against fraud.</p>
    <p>“The use of SingPass will pro­vide se­cure au­then­ti­ca­tion for the dis­tri­bu­tion of the vouch­ers and help mit­i­gate fraud,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to Work­ers’ Party MP Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC) on whether the vouch­ers can be used for arts-re­lated events such as fes­ti­vals and stage plays, Mr Tan noted that mu­se­ums and gal­leries cater­ing to tourists are el­i­gi­ble for the scheme.</p>
    <p>He said arts and cul­tural or­gan­i­sa­tions of­fer­ing com­ple­men­tary prod­ucts can work with el­i­gi­ble mer­chants, such as ho­tels, tourist at­trac­tions and tours, to de­velop bun­dles to qual­ify for the us­age of the vouch­ers.</p>
