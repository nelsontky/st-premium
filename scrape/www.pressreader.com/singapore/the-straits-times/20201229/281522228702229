    <p>Demo­crat law­mak­ers were set yes­ter­day to push through ex­panded US$2,000 (S$2,660) re­lief pay­ments for Amer­i­cans after Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump backed down and signed into law a US$2.3 tril­lion pan­demic aid and spend­ing pack­age.</p>
    <p>WASHINGTON/PALM BEACH (United States) • Democrats in the US Congress were due yes­ter­day to try to push through ex­panded US$2,000 (S$2,660) pan­demic re­lief pay­ments for Amer­i­cans after Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump backed down from a fight with law­mak­ers that could have shut down the fed­eral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In a sud­den re­ver­sal late on Sun­day, Mr Trump signed into law a US$2.3 tril­lion (S$3 tril­lion) pan­demic aid and spend­ing pack­age, restor­ing un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits to mil­lions of Amer­i­cans and pro­vid­ing funds to keep gov­ern­ment agen­cies run­ning.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who will leave of­fice on Jan 20 after los­ing last month’s elec­tion to now Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, re­treated from his threat to block the Bill – which was ap­proved by Congress last week – after he came un­der pres­sure from law­mak­ers on both sides.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent had last week called the Bill a “dis­grace” and de­manded that Congress change it to in­crease the size of stim­u­lus cheques for strug­gling Amer­i­cans from US$600 to US$2,000 while also cut­ting some other spend­ing.</p>
    <p>It was not im­me­di­ately clear why Mr Trump, who has re­fused to con­cede de­feat to Mr Bi­den, changed his mind on the stim­u­lus pack­age. But Repub­li­cans face a tight runoff elec­tion for two Se­nate seats in Ge­or­gia early next month which could de­cide which party con­trols the cham­ber.</p>
    <p>His sur­prise, last-minute re­sis­tance had threat­ened to in­ject fur­ther chaos into the fi­nal stretch of his pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>De­spite that, Demo­cratic law­mak­ers, who have a ma­jor­ity in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives and have long wanted US$2,000 re­lief cheques, hoped to use a rare point of agree­ment with Mr Trump to ad­vance the pro­posal – or at least put Repub­li­cans on record against it – in a vote yes­ter­day lo­cal time.</p>
    <p>Many of Mr Trump’s fel­low Repub­li­cans op­pose the higher pay­ments, and he might not have the in­flu­ence to budge them.</p>
    <p>The is­sue ap­pears un­likely to gain trac­tion in the Repub­li­can­con­trolled Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Many econ­o­mists agree that the fi­nan­cial aid in the Bill should be big­ger to get the econ­omy mov­ing again, but say that im­me­di­ate sup­port for Amer­i­cans hit by coro­n­avirus lock­downs is still ur­gently needed.</p>
    <p>After sign­ing the Bill be­hind closed doors at his beach­side club in Florida, Mr Trump sought to put the best face on his climb­down, say­ing he was sign­ing it with “a strong mes­sage that makes clear to Congress that waste­ful items need to be re­moved”. “Much more money is com­ing,” he in­sisted in a state­ment, though he pro­vided noth­ing to back this prom­ise.</p>
    <p>With less than a month left in of­fice, Mr Trump is un­likely to get his fel­low Repub­li­cans to back the ex­tra money for in­di­vid­u­als or per­suade Democrats to ac­cept spend­ing cuts he says he wants else­where in the spend­ing Bill, par­tic­u­larly in for­eign aid.</p>
    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits be­ing paid out to about 14 mil­lion peo­ple through pan­demic pro­grammes lapsed last Satur­day but will be restarted now that Mr Trump has signed the Bill.</p>
    <p>The pack­age in­cludes US$1.4 tril­lion in spend­ing to fund gov­ern­ment agen­cies. If Mr Trump had not signed the leg­is­la­tion, then a par­tial gov­ern­ment shut­down would have be­gun to­day that would have put mil­lions of gov­ern­ment work­ers’ in­comes at risk.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­cans are liv­ing through a bit­ter hol­i­day sea­son with a pan­demic that has killed 333,000 peo­ple in the United States, with a daily death toll now re­peat­edly well over 3,000, the high­est since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>The re­lief pack­age also ex­tends a mora­to­rium on evic­tions that was due to ex­pire on Thurs­day, re­freshes sup­port for small busi­ness pay­rolls, and pro­vides fund­ing to help schools re­open as well as aid for the trans­port in­dus­try and vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>Also yes­ter­day, law­mak­ers were due to seek to over­ride Mr Trump’s re­cent veto of a US$740 bil­lion Bill set­ting pol­icy for the De­fence Depart­ment. If suc­cess­ful, it would be the first veto over­ride of Mr Trump’s pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said he ve­toed the leg­is­la­tion, which has passed ev­ery year since 1961, be­cause he ob­jected to li­a­bil­ity pro­tec­tions for so­cial me­dia com­pa­nies un­re­lated to na­tional se­cu­rity and did not want to re­name mil­i­tary bases named after gen­er­als who fought for the pro-slav­ery Con­fed­er­acy dur­ing the Civil War.</p>
    <p>Al­though his pre­vi­ous eight vetoes were all up­held thanks to sup­port from Repub­li­cans, ad­vis­ers said this one looked likely to be over­rid­den. The Bill passed both houses of Congress with mar­gins greater than the two-thirds ma­jori­ties that would be needed to over­ride the Pres­i­dent’s veto.</p>
