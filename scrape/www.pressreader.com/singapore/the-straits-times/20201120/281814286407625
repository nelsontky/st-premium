    <p>POW­ER­LESS TO STOP IT</p>
    <p>The tip of the coro­n­avirus spear is pierc­ing the United States’ long-term care fa­cil­i­ties again in a surge that un­der­scores the coun­try’s re­peated fail­ure to pro­tect its most vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>States re­ported over 29,000 new in­fec­tions last week in places such as nurs­ing homes and as­sisted-liv­ing fa­cil­i­ties, the steep­est uptick since at least May, ac­cord­ing to Covid Track­ing Project data.</p>
    <p>They come as na­tional daily case counts were higher than ever this month, with a record of over 170,000 new cases on Nov 13.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, Pfizer said its ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine was 95 per cent ef­fec­tive, but de­vel­op­ments else­where mean months of suf­fer­ing un­til the shots are widely avail­able.</p>
    <p>The US passed 250,000 deaths, New York City stopped in-per­son school­ing, Wis­con­sin will ex­tend a mask man­date into next year and news emerged that more than 900 workers at Min­nesota’s Mayo Clinic have been in­fected in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>Min­nesota Gov­er­nor Tim Walz said in an evening ad­dress that he would shut down much of its econ­omy for a month.</p>
    <p>State lead­ers, pub­lic health ex­perts and own­ers are sound­ing the loud­est alarms over the in­fec­tion spike in nurs­ing homes and longterm care, where cases were fall­ing un­til Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, vis­its from fam­i­lies trav­el­ling for the hol­i­days threaten to ex­ac­er­bate the out­break.</p>
    <p>“Our worst fears have come true as Covid-19 runs ram­pant among the general pop­u­la­tion,” Mr Mark Parkin­son, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the Amer­i­can Health Care As­so­ci­a­tion and Na­tional Cen­tre for As­sisted Liv­ing, said. “Long-term care fa­cil­i­ties are pow­er­less to fully pre­vent it from en­ter­ing.”</p>
    <p>More than half of the coun­try’s nurs­ing homes have staff re­port­ing in­fec­tions, and about 20 per cent have more than 10 cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Parkin­son’s group, which rep­re­sents more than 14,000 nurs­ing homes and as­sisted-liv­ing com­mu­ni­ties, said that com­mu­nity spread in the broader pop­u­la­tion is linked to cases in nurs­ing homes.</p>
    <p>In the week lead­ing up to Nov 12, Ohio re­ported the largest weekly in­crease in long-term care cases, ac­count­ing for 10 per cent of the na­tional to­tal.</p>
    <p>Illi­nois saw cases dou­ble to nearly 2,000 in a week, and Kansas shat­tered its record. In New Hamp­shire, four of five deaths have oc­curred in a long-term fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>The data likely un­der­es­ti­mates the toll. States vary in re­port­ing: Some com­bine res­i­dent and staff cases, while oth­ers do not re­port ac­tive out­breaks in fa­cil­i­ties at all.</p>
    <p>Many states have set harsher lock­downs, par­tic­u­larly in the Mid­west, where the spread has been sus­tained and se­vere.</p>
    <p>In Kaukauna, Wis­con­sin, St Paul Elder Ser­vices has ex­pe­ri­enced two dis­tinct out­breaks at its nurs­ing home since Au­gust, said chief ex­ec­u­tive Son­dra Norder. Both times, em­ploy­ees who caught the virus in the com­mu­nity brought it into the fa­cil­ity and spread it among pa­tients and col­leagues.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, 75 res­i­dents of about 120 have tested pos­i­tive, of whom 12 died during treat­ment and eight died af­ter dis­charge. About 80 em­ploy­ees have also been in­fected.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion is frus­trat­ingly cycli­cal for ex­perts.</p>
    <p>“It re­ally has a feel­ing of deja vu,” said Pro­fes­sor David Grabowski from Har­vard Med­i­cal School, adding that lessons from the first two spikes in nurs­ing homes</p>
    <p>chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the Amer­i­can Health Care As­so­ci­a­tion and Na­tional Cen­tre for As­sisted Liv­ing. Mr Parkin­son’s group, which rep­re­sents more than 14,000 nurs­ing homes and as­sisted-liv­ing com­mu­ni­ties, said that com­mu­nity spread in the broader pop­u­la­tion is linked to cases in nurs­ing homes. should have made a third pre­ventable.</p>
    <p>But mis­steps, mainly by the fed­eral gov­ern­ment, such as fail­ure to nationalis­e the equip­ment sup­ply chain and en­sure test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, have left the el­derly and the pub­lic at risk again.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can Health Care As­so­ci­a­tion is ask­ing for a litany of as­sis­tance mea­sures, rang­ing from a US$5 bil­lion (S$6.73 bil­lion) test­ing fund to vac­cine pri­or­ity for res­i­dents and staff and en­shrined Med­i­caid pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment has made avail­able US$333 mil­lion for in­cen­tives granted to high-per­form­ing homes, and sup­plied about 12 mil­lion tests as well as per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Michael Bars, a White House spokesman, said on Wed­nes­day that the ad­min­is­tra­tion would pri­ori­tise vac­cine distributi­on “to pro­tect the health and safety of el­derly Amer­i­cans in nurs­ing homes and se­nior liv­ing cen­tres”.</p>
    <p>Colorado state epi­demi­ol­o­gist Rachel Her­lihy was op­ti­mistic about the tra­jec­tory of the pandemic in homes. “We’re find­ing those out­breaks sooner, and that’s largely through the test­ing strate­gies that are in place,” she said at a Wed­nes­day news brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Our worst fears have come true as Covid-19 runs ram­pant among the general pop­u­la­tion. Long-term care fa­cil­i­ties are pow­er­less to fully pre­vent it from en­ter­ing.</p>
