    <p>There is some­thing uniquely frus­trat­ing about a glitchy Zoom call.</p>
    <p>Cross-con­ti­nen­tal pro­duc­tion Who’s There? par­lays that frus­tra­tion into a febrile dia­logue about race, where you are never sure if the glitches are due to tech­ni­cal mal­func­tion or a broader metaphor about the dif­fi­culty of con­nec­tion be­tween op­pos­ing points of view.</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­tion not only works around but also em­braces the re­stric­tions of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Co-di­rected by Alvin Tan, founder of Sin­ga­pore the­atre com­pany The Nec­es­sary Stage, and New York­based Sim Yan Ying for New Ohio The­atre’s Ice Fac­tory Fes­ti­val, it fea­tures a cast and crew work­ing across time zones – some up late in Sin­ga­pore or Malaysia, oth­ers just start­ing the day in the United States.</p>
    <p>It is re­lent­lessly top­i­cal, cov­er­ing is­sues from the Black Lives Mat­ter protests in Amer­ica to the furore over Ms Raeesah Khan, the newly elected Work­ers’ Party Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment for Sengkang GRC, who was in­ves­ti­gated by the po­lice for her past so­cial me­dia posts about race dur­ing the cam­paign lead­ing up to the Gen­eral Elec­tion on July 10.</p>
    <p>The cast for Who’s There? plays a loosely con­nected set of char­ac­ters. Iyla (Camille Thomas), a black Amer­i­can in­flu­encer, is dis­turbed by a Malaysian stu­dent mu­si­cal which makes use of black­face and con­fronts the school’s as­sis­tant di­rec­tor Amir (Ghafir Ak­bar), who main­tains the black­face is part of tra­di­tion even if he dis­agrees with it pri­vately.</p>
    <p>Iyla’s Sin­ga­porean friend Sharmila (Re­bekah Sangeetha Do­rai) gets into an In­sta­gram feud with former school­mate Yue Ting (Sim), a US-based ac­tivist vo­cal about Black Lives Mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Sharmila calls her out for be­ing “woke” abroad, but silent about racism back in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Who’s There? throws it­self into its medium with metathe­atri­cal verve. Scenes are brack­eted by polls for the au­di­ence: Can so­cial me­dia call-outs ef­fect real change? Do racists de­serve em­pa­thy?</p>
    <p>Par­al­lel con­ver­sa­tions run on­screen and in the chat side­bar. Ghafir point­edly mutes him­self dur­ing a heated de­bate where ac­cu­sa­tions of priv­i­lege are thrown around.</p>
    <p>“I saw that, Per­former 2,” snipes Sim in the chat. “We don’t need that pas­sive-ag­gres­sive­ness.”</p>
    <p>At 100 min­utes, the piece drags some­what, es­pe­cially in scenes where the per­form­ers play with fil­ters or dance in a vir­tual club set­ting.</p>
    <p>Do­rai, as she of­ten does in en­sem­bles of un­even qual­ity, holds the piece to­gether. Her char­ac­ter, Sharmila, has some of the most poignant mo­ments in the play, such as when she de­scribes her ex­pe­ri­ences of racism as an In­dian woman in Sin­ga­pore or plays record­ings of con­ver­sa­tions with mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>Who’s There? is rough around the edges and re­solves few of the many questions it throws up, but it opens a space for much-needed con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
