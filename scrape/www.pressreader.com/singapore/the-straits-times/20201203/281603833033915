    <p>The Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity (HSA) has started eval­u­at­ing the avail­able data sub­mit­ted by Covid-19 vac­cine de­vel­oper Moderna “to en­sure ex­pe­di­tious re­view”, the au­thor­ity said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>HSA said it has been in dis­cus­sion with the Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy com­pany on the sub­mis­sion plan for its vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“Moderna has started sub­mit­ting ini­tial data and will con­tinue to roll in data as soon as they be­come avail­able as agreed with HSA,” said the HSA spokesman.</p>
    <p>This rolling sub­mis­sion process al­lows com­pa­nies to sub­mit re­al­time data from on­go­ing stud­ies while HSA con­ducts the reg­u­la­tory re­view si­mul­ta­ne­ously.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said this path­way could speed up the ap­proval process, while en­sur­ing that there is ad­e­quate sci­en­tific ev­i­dence to sup­port the qual­ity, safety and ef­fi­cacy of the prod­uct.</p>
    <p>“De­pend­ing on the speed of data ac­crual by the com­pany, this re­duces the reg­u­la­tory turn­around time, pro­vided there are no sig­nif­i­cant ad­verse events, and rel­e­vant stud­ies to sup­port safety and ef­fi­cacy are sub­mit­ted by the time of prod­uct ap­pli­ca­tion,” she added.</p>
    <p>The com­pany will also be re­quired to sub­mit on­go­ing data to sup­port the safety and ef­fi­cacy of the vac­cine, said the HSA spokesman.</p>
    <p>Moderna chief ex­ec­u­tive Stephane Ban­cel had told The Straits Times on Tues­day night that the com­pany is in talks with HSA to ap­prove the use of the firm’s vac­cine here.</p>
    <p>If all goes well, the first batch of vac­cines could ar­rive here as early as this month, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ban­cel also noted that the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has been proac­tive in or­der­ing doses for peo­ple here, al­though he de­clined to pro­vide fig­ures.</p>
    <p>“The Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment, very early, back in the sum­mer, has been or­der­ing doses for its in­hab­i­tants, and has been or­der­ing more re­cently with more data,” Mr Ban­cel said in the video in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>Moderna had on Mon­day re­leased the full re­sults from its lat­estage clin­i­cal trial, which in­volved 30,000 peo­ple. The study had shown that the vac­cine was 94.1 per cent ef­fec­tive in pre­vent­ing Covid-19, and 100 per cent ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing se­vere dis­ease from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Moderna said it has ap­plied for US emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion of the vac­cine, fol­low­ing a sim­i­lar move made ear­lier by Pfizer and BioNTech – the firms be­hind another Covid-19 vac­cine front run­ner.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain yes­ter­day granted tem­po­rary au­tho­ri­sa­tion for emer­gency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine there – the first emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion in the world.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong had said last month that Sin­ga­pore would work on se­cur­ing a port­fo­lio of Covid-19 vac­cines to cater to dif­fer­ent seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion in­stead of re­ly­ing on just one vac­cine.</p>
    <p>But HSA’s spokesman de­clined to say if other firms had ap­proached it to ap­prove the use of other Covid-19 vac­cines here, cit­ing pro­pri­etary rea­sons.</p>
