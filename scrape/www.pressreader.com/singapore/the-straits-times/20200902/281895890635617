    <p>BANGKOK • The case against the Thai heir to the Red Bull bil­lions ac­cused of a fa­tal hit-and-run was “com­pro­mised” from be­gin­ning to end, the Pre­mier’s of­fice said yes­ter­day, call­ing the en­tire pro­ce­dure “dis­hon­est”.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment came a month af­ter charges against Vo­rayuth “Boss” Yoovid­hya were dropped by the po­lice and At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Of­fice, prompt­ing ou­trage from Thais who saw it as an­other ex­am­ple of the im­punity en­joyed by the king­dom’s elite.</p>
    <p>The con­tro­versy sur­round­ing the case comes dur­ing a tense pe­riod for the govern­ment, as a bur­geon­ing pro-democ­racy move­ment has gath­ered pace, with near-daily protests across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Vo­rayuth was ac­cused of killing a po­lice of­fi­cer in a hit-and-run in 2012 af­ter crash­ing his Fer­rari in Bangkok, and of us­ing co­caine at the time of the ac­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>He fled the coun­try on his pri­vate jet in 2017, but his re­turn was widely ex­pected af­ter the au­thor­i­ties re­vealed in July that all charges against him had been dropped.</p>
    <p>But a huge pub­lic out­cry – in­clud­ing hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple us­ing the hash­tag #Boy­cottRedBul­l on so­cial me­dia – prompted three new probes.</p>
    <p>One, set up by Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha’s of­fice, con­cluded yes­ter­day that the en­tire in­ves­ti­ga­tion had been “il­le­gal”.</p>
    <p>“The case’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion was com­pro­mised,” com­mit­tee chair­man Vicha Ma­hakun told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“It was done dis­hon­estly and with con­spir­acy to weaken the case.”</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut, whose ad­min­is­tra­tion has long en­joyed close al­liances with the king­dom’s bil­lion­aire clans, said the Red Bull case cast doubt on the coun­try’s le­gal and crim­i­nal sys­tems.</p>
    <p>“There were po­lice­men, at­tor­neys-gen­eral and peo­ple in pol­i­tics in­volved,” he said, promis­ing that “le­gal and ethics ac­tions” would be taken against them.</p>
    <p>The re­port from the Pre­mier’s of­fice came a week af­ter Bangkok’s</p>
    <p>Crim­i­nal Court is­sued a fresh ar­rest war­rant for Vo­rayuth.</p>
    <p>As the grand­son to Red Bull co­founder Cha­leo Yoovid­hya, the 38-year-old is part of a clan which boasts a net worth of US$20.2 bil­lion (S$27.4 bil­lion), mak­ing it Thai­land’s se­cond-rich­est fam­ily, ac­cord­ing to Forbes.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral other in­ci­dents have added to pub­lic sus­pi­cions of a cover-up, in­clud­ing the death in a mo­tor­cy­cle ac­ci­dent last month of a man whom po­lice pre­sented years af­ter the case as a wit­ness who had cleared Vo­rayuth of in­volve­ment.</p>
    <p>A small group of demon­stra­tors ral­lied in cen­tral Bangkok yes­ter­day, call­ing again for Mr Prayut’s re­moval from of­fice.</p>
    <p>Other pro­test­ers have re­cently waded into ta­boo ter­ri­tory by call­ing for re­forms to the coun­try’s unas­sail­able monar­chy.</p>
    <p>One of them, stu­dent leader Ju­tatip Sirikhan, was ar­rested yes­ter­day – the lat­est among dozens who face mul­ti­ple charges in­clud­ing sedi­tion.</p>
