    <p>NATHANAEL TAN, 29</p>
    <p>Se­nior staff nurse</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, Emer­gency Medicine De­part­ment</p>
    <p>It has been seven months since Mr Nathanael Tan, 29, has held his sons – who are aged one and three – close.</p>
    <p>“No hugs, no kisses. It is very emo­tion­ally dis­tant for my two kids, es­pe­cially be­cause they like get­ting good­night hugs and morn­ing kisses,” said Mr Tan, a se­nior staff nurse at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal’s Emer­gency Medicine De­part­ment (EMD).</p>
    <p>Be­ing in the first line of de­fence against Covid-19, Mr Tan has at­tended to EMD pa­tients who were later found to be in­fected with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Al­though he is dressed in per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment at work, main­tain­ing a dis­tance from his fam­ily gives him fur­ther re­as­sur­ance that he is not un­know­ingly putting them in dan­ger.</p>
    <p>Af­ter show­er­ing in the hos­pi­tal be­fore head­ing home, Mr Tan would take a sec­ond shower at home be­fore re­tir­ing to a sep­a­rate bed­room next to his wife and chil­dren’s.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan’s older son, who is scared of thun­der, used to snug­gle against him for com­fort.</p>
    <p>“It’s the rainy sea­son now and at night when there is thun­der, he will cry out for me and I can’t do any­thing. I can’t com­fort him. The only thing I can do is video-call him,” he said.</p>
    <p>With­out good­bye hugs at the door, his chil­dren will oc­ca­sion­ally cry when Mr Tan leaves for work.</p>
    <p>“At first it was very sad, but we nurses took a pledge to help at all times, in pan­demic pe­ri­ods and safe pe­ri­ods.”</p>
    <p>Mr Tan is also no stranger to wary looks on pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>In April, when he hailed a taxi in civil­ian clothes, the driver asked him why he was go­ing to the EMD be­fore let­ting him in.</p>
    <p>“When I en­tered the taxi, he wound down all the win­dows.</p>
    <p>“It was un­der­stand­able. Ev­ery­one has his fears, we nurses also have our fears.”</p>
