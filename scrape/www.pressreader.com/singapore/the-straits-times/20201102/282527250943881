    <p>The ac­cus­tomis­ing process has taken six weeks, but Chelsea man­ager Frank Lam­pard be­lieves his ex­pen­sively as­sem­bled team are fi­nally find­ing the right bal­ance be­tween at­tack and de­fence.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors shut out Burn­ley for their fourth suc­ces­sive clean sheet in all com­pe­ti­tions, com­ing away with a 3-0 win at Turf Moor in the Premier League on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Hakim Ziyech opened the scor­ing in the first half, fol­lowed by goals from Kurt Zouma and Timo Werner af­ter the in­ter­val.</p>
    <p>De­spite los­ing Chris­tian Pulisic in the pre-game warm-up ses­sion to a ham­string is­sue, the Blues were too good for the hosts, leav­ing Lam­pard de­lighted with his team’s pro­gres­sion af­ter splurg­ing over £200 mil­lion (S$354 mil­lion) dur­ing the trans­fer win­dow.</p>
    <p>“There was cer­tainly bal­ance (miss­ing) there and we worked on that,” he told re­porters after­wards.</p>
    <p>“That’s part of the process when we’ve brought in new play­ers. When you’re keep­ing clean sheets and scor­ing goals, you’re go­ing in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The clean sheets are a great sign of a spine in the team. Thi­ago Silva and Edouard Mendy have mas­sively helped that but so has the men­tal­ity of the group.</p>
    <p>“I’m not go­ing to jump up and down af­ter a win like this, but it was a re­ally pos­i­tive day.”</p>
    <p>The Blues are only four points be­hind league cham­pi­ons Liver­pool (16), and Lam­pard has high ex­pec­ta­tions that his play­ers will con­tinue to kick on, es­pe­cially Ziyech.</p>
    <p>The Morocco winger, a €40 mil­lion (S$63.6 mil­lion) ar­rival from Ajax in the sum­mer, is the first player to score in his first two starts for Chelsea in all com­pe­ti­tions since Diego Costa in Au­gust 2014.</p>
    <p>A knee in­jury suf­fered dur­ing pre-sea­son meant that Ziyech made his first league start for the Blues only on Satur­day, but he is fast be­com­ing one of the first names on the team sheet.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally like him as a per­son­al­ity,” Lam­pard said. “I had con­ver­sa­tions with him very early when we signed him and was struck by his con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>“We needed that. We need play­ers with con­fi­dence and per­son­al­ity who be­lieve they should be here and want to of­fer some­thing. He has been an ab­so­lute dream to work with... he has made him­self at home in a short space of time.”</p>
