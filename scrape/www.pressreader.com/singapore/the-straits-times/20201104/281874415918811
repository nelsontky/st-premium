    <p>VI­ENNA • The Aus­trian cap­i­tal had been spared the kind of deadly mil­i­tant at­tacks that have struck Paris, Lon­don, Berlin and Brus­sels, among oth­ers, un­til Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Oskar Deutsch, head of Vi­enna’s Jewish com­mu­nity, which has of­fices ad­join­ing the syn­a­gogue on a nar­row street dot­ted with bars, said on Twitter it was not clear whether the Jewish tem­ple or of­fices were tar­geted but that they were closed at the time.</p>
    <p>Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeis­ter told Lon­don’s LBC ra­dio he lived in the com­pound of the syn­a­gogue. “Upon hear­ing shots, we looked down from the win­dows and saw the gun­men shoot­ing at the guests of the var­i­ous bars and pubs,” he said.</p>
    <p>Con­do­lences poured in from top of­fi­cials from the Euro­pean Union, France, Nor­way, Greece and the United States.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron of France, which has seen two deadly knife at­tacks in Paris and Nice in re­cent weeks, is­sued a state­ment ex­press­ing shock and sor­row. “This is our Europe,” he said. “Our ene­mies must know with whom they are deal­ing. We will not re­treat.”</p>
    <p>France has ramped up se­cu­rity since the re­cent at­tacks, which had sus­pected Is­lamist mo­tives.</p>
    <p>Turkey’s for­eign min­istry said it was sad­dened by the news: “As a coun­try that has been fight­ing against all sorts of ter­ror­ism for decades, Turkey stands in sol­i­dar­ity with the Aus­trian peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said: “These evil at­tacks against in­no­cent peo­ple must stop. The US stands with Austria, France and all of Europe in the fight against ter­ror­ists, in­clud­ing rad­i­cal Is­lamic ter­ror­ists.”</p>
    <p>His chal­lenger in the US pres­i­den­tial election, Mr Joe Bi­den, con­demned what he called a “hor­rific ter­ror­ist at­tack”, adding: “We must all stand united against hate and vi­o­lence”.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin “strongly con­demned the cruel and cyn­i­cal crime which once again con­firmed the in­hu­mane na­ture of ter­ror­ism”, the Krem­lin said.</p>
    <p>United Na­tions sec­re­tary-gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res said he had been fol­low­ing “with grave con­cern” the ter­ror at­tacks. “I con­demn these at­tacks in the strong­est pos­si­ble terms and reaf­firm the UN’s sol­i­dar­ity with the peo­ple and gov­ern­ment of Austria”.</p>
    <p>The Saudi Ara­bian for­eign min­istry said it strongly con­demned the at­tacks. The coun­try af­firmed its sol­i­dar­ity with Austria “in tak­ing all nec­es­sary mea­sures to main­tain se­cu­rity and pro­tect the safety of all from ex­trem­ism ten­den­cies and acts of ter­ror­ism and vi­o­lence in all its forms”.</p>
