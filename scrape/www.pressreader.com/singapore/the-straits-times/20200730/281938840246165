    <p>CAIRO • Armed with vaguely worded laws, Egypt’s guardians of con­ser­va­tive morals have l ong fo­cused on belly dancers and pop stars i n their ef­forts to po­lice women’s be­hav­iour. Now they have hit upon a new tar­get – young women who have be­come fa­mous on so­cial me­dia plat­forms like TikTok and Instagram.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est episode of a lon­grun­ning cul­ture war, an Egyp­tian court on Mon­day con­victed two fe­male so­cial me­dia stars on charges of “vi­o­lat­ing fam­ily val­ues” and sen­tenced each of them to two years in pri­son.</p>
    <p>The court also found three men guilty on charges of help­ing post the women’s videos and re­ceived the same sen­tence, lawyers said.</p>
    <p>The con­vic­tions were the first ver­dicts from a se­ries of at least nine ar­rests since April of young Egyp­tian women who are prom­i­nent on TikTok, a wildly pop­u­lar app.</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia is a highly con­tested and of­ten per­ilous space in Egypt, a coun­try where the gov­ern­ment ex­erts tight con­trol over tra­di­tional me­dia such as news­pa­pers and tele­vi­sion, and has used courts to pa­trol dig­i­tal plat­forms be­yond its reach.</p>
    <p>Nu­mer­ous Egyp­tians have been jailed for posts on Twit­ter and Face­book deemed crit­i­cal of the gov­ern­ment, or of Pres­i­dent Ab­del-Fat­tah el-Sissi. At least 500 news web­sites have been blocked.</p>
    <p>In some coun­tries, TikTok, which is owned by a Chi­nese com­pany, has come un­der in­tense scru­tiny over con­cerns that the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment could use it to spy on users. US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is con­sid­er­ing steps to ban the app.</p>
    <p>But in Egypt, the fo­cus is largely on the app’s po­ten­tial ef­fect on the coun­try’s moral pro­bity.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral women, mostly in their 20s, have be­come fa­mous through their use of TikTok, in some cases earn­ing thou­sands of dol­lars by</p>
    <p>The two women con­victed on Mon­day gained mil­lions of fol­low­ers for light­hearted videos they posted to TikTok and other plat­forms that show them singing, danc­ing and clown­ing about. The clips are tame by so­cial me­dia stan­dards and noth­ing that would raise the eye­brow of a broad­cast cen­sor in the West.</p>
    <p>mon­etis­ing their large fol­low­ings. Some wear head­scarves, a sign that they come from con­ser­va­tive fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The back­lash has come from Egypt’s Par­lia­ment as well as the courts, with some law­mak­ers de­mand­ing that the gov­ern­ment sus­pend TikTok, ac­cus­ing it of pro­mot­ing nu­dity and im­moral­ity.</p>
    <p>Most of the women fac­ing pros­e­cu­tion for their TikTok posts were put in jail with­out bail. Hu­man rights ac­tivists launched a dig­i­tal cam­paign last week to de­mand their re­lease.</p>
    <p>The two women con­victed on Mon­day – Ha­neen Hos­sam, 20, and Mawada el-Ad­ham, 22 – gained mil­lions of fol­low­ers for light­hearted videos they posted to TikTok and other plat­forms that show them singing, danc­ing and clown­ing about. The clips are tame by so­cial me­dia stan­dards and noth­ing that would raise the eye­brow of a broad­cast cen­sor in the West.</p>
    <p>The women wept as a judge at the Cairo Eco­nomic Court handed down the sen­tences, one of their lawyers said. They were also fined nearly US$19,000 (S$26,200) each.</p>
    <p>Hos­sam, a se­cond-year ar­chae­ol­ogy stu­dent at Cairo Univer­sity, was ar­rested in April for a short Instagram video clip that prosecutor­s called “in­de­cent”. In the video, she en­cour­aged women to post videos of them­selves to the app Li­kee, which pays users based on the num­ber of views they re­ceive.</p>
    <p>Egyp­tian prosecutor­s ac­cused Hos­sam, who usu­ally wears a head­scarf in her videos, of invit­ing young women to sell sex on­line. Her lawyer Ahmed Ab­delnaby de­nied the charge. “Noth­ing she said in that video vi­o­lated the law. The video is proof of her in­no­cence, not the op­po­site,” he said.</p>
    <p>The se­cond so­cial me­dia star, Ad­ham, a for­mer beauty pageant con­tes­tant with 3.2 mil­lion fol­low­ers on TikTok, was on the run for days be­fore her ar­rest in May, mov­ing be­tween houses in the Cairo sub­urbs and Egypt’s Mediter­ranean coast. Dur­ing the trial, prosecutor­s slammed videos that she posted as “dis­grace­ful and in­sult­ing”, her lawyer said.</p>
    <p>In one of Ad­ham’s last videos, be­fore po­lice tracked her down us­ing her phone sig­nal and In­ter­net use, she posed smil­ing in a velour one-piece jump­suit with her hair dyed blue.</p>
