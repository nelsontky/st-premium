    <p>PH­NOM PENH • Cam­bo­dia has be­gun ex­tract­ing its first crude oil from fields in the Gulf of Thai­land, in a ven­ture be­tween Sin­ga­pore’s KrisEn­ergy and the gov­ern­ment, both par­ties said yes­ter­day, bring­ing an end to years of de­lays.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Hun Sen an­nounced the news on social me­dia while KrisEn­ergy said the con­ces­sion started pro­duc­tion on Mon­day and would progress in phases once new wells were com­mis­sioned and com­pleted.</p>
    <p>“I... am pleased to in­form all Cam­bo­di­ans about the start of Cam­bo­dia’s first oil pro­duc­tion in the long-awaited Block A,” Mr Hun Sen said on his Face­book page.</p>
    <p>Mr Kelvin Tang, chief ex­ec­u­tive of KrisEn­ergy’s Cam­bo­dian op­er­a­tions, called the event “an important strate­gic mile­stone” for the com­pany.</p>
    <p>“There has been a steep learn­ing curve for all in­volved,” he added in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Cam­bo­dia and Sin­ga­pore-listed KrisEn­ergy signed a pact in 2017 to de­velop 3,083 square kilo­me­tres of the Kh­mer basin in the Gulf of Thai­land known as Block A.</p>
    <p>Cam­bo­dia has strug­gled to de­velop its oil fields as few com­pa­nies were will­ing to in­vest in the area, fol­low­ing a global oil price slump in 2014.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-listed KrisEn­ergy, which has been a part­ner in the pro­ject for more than a decade, bought out Chevron Corp’s op­er­at­ing in­ter­est in Block A in 2014 for US$65 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Chevron had found oil in the block in 2004 but failed to strike a de­vel­op­ment agree­ment with Cam­bo­dia, which has a 5 per cent stake in the ven­ture with KrisEn­ergy.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, KrisEn­ergy had an­tic­i­pated oil pro­duc­tion from the As­para field to start some time last year.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the com­pany said de­vel­op­ment of that field would pro­ceed in phases, al­low­ing time to mit­i­gate risks as well as col­lect and as­sess data, since the pro­duc­tion per­for­mance of the basin is un­proven.</p>
    <p>KrisEn­ergy shares have been sus­pended since Au­gust last year as the com­pany ex­plored re­struc­tur­ing op­tions.</p>
