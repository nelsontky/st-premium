    <p>WASHINGTON • The United States has held pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nat­ing con­ven­tions for al­most 200 years, and they have served in re­cent decades as an im­por­tant tele­vised in­tro­duc­tion to each party’s can­di­date in the fi­nal months be­fore the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Here is a look at the up­com­ing Demo­cratic and Repub­li­can na­tional con­ven­tions, with the Demo­cratic event set to kick off yes­ter­day and the Repub­li­can con­ven­tion to be held next week.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­den­tial elec­tion is on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>Pick­ing a nom­i­nee</p>
    <p>US po­lit­i­cal con­ven­tions were once a place where pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nees were de­cided, of­ten af­ter mul­ti­ple bal­lots and long fights, and fre­quently among party elders in “smoke-filled rooms”.</p>
    <p>But that has not hap­pened in decades.</p>
    <p>The last time a nom­i­na­tion was in much doubt as a con­ven­tion opened was 1976, when Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Ger­ald Ford held off Mr Ron­ald Rea­gan in Kansas City, Mis­souri.</p>
    <p>The last con­ven­tion to go be­yond a first bal­lot was in 1952 in Chicago, when Democrats chose Illi­nois Gover­nor Ad­lai Steven­son.</p>
    <p>Now, the nom­i­nees are cho­sen by vot­ers in a stateby-state se­ries of pri­mary elec­tions, with del­e­gates from each state rat­i­fy­ing the choice at con­ven­tions that are de­signed to show­case the party’s can­di­date and mes­sage.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic con­ven­tion was set to run un­til Thurs­day af­ter the sched­uled start yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can con­ven­tion will be held from Aug 24 to 27.</p>
    <p>Both will be mostly vir­tual this year, be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Who will speak?</p>
    <p>Four nights of speeches at each con­ven­tion are in­tended to ex­cite a prime-time tele­vi­sion au­di­ence to get be­hind the nom­i­nee and serve as the start­ing gun for the fi­nal sprint to the Novem­ber elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The par­ties will trot out heavy­weight po­lit­i­cal names be­fore the pre­sump­tive nom­i­nees – Demo­cratic former vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den and Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump – de­liver their ac­cep­tance speeches on the re­spec­tive fi­nal nights.</p>
    <p>But the con­ven­tions also pro­vide a chance for the par­ties to high­light peo­ple they view as up-and-com­ing po­lit­i­cal stars.</p>
    <p>Few have taken ad­van­tage of the op­por­tu­nity as well as Mr Barack Obama in 2004, when the rel­a­tively un­known Illi­nois Demo­cratic state leg­is­la­tor de­liv­ered an in­dict­ment of po­lit­i­cal po­lar­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The key­note ad­dress helped pro­pel him to the White House four years later.</p>
    <p>This year, Democrats will spot­light 17 young politi­cians they con­sider “ris­ing stars”, in­clud­ing one­time vice-pres­i­den­tial hope­ful Stacey Abrams, in a key­note ad­dress set for to­day.</p>
    <p>The poll bounce</p>
    <p>Both party can­di­dates usu­ally ben­e­fit from a small bounce in opin­ion polls af­ter their pro­longed ex­po­sure at con­ven­tions, but the ef­fect is of­ten short­lived and the bounces have be­come smaller as US pol­i­tics be­come more po­larised.</p>
    <p>Polling av­er­ages com­piled by the Amer­i­can Pres­i­dency Project at the Uni­ver­sity of Cal­i­for­nia at Santa Bar­bara show that Democrat Hil­lary Clin­ton re­ceived a 2 per­cent­age point bounce and Mr Trump a three­p­oint bounce af­ter the 2016 con­ven­tions.</p>
    <p>The last time the dif­fer­ence in bounces be­tween the two par­ties was more than 2 per­cent­age points was in 1992, when Democrat Bill Clin­ton’s jump was 16 points and Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Ge­orge H.W. Bush’s was five points.</p>
    <p>Mr Clin­ton went on to win the White House.</p>
