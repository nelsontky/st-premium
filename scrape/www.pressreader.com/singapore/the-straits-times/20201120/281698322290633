    <p>More em­ploy­ers are be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for pos­si­ble dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices, ac­cord­ing to a re­port on em­ploy­ment prac­tices re­leased yesterday.</p>
    <p>The Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices (Tafep), the na­tional watch­dog on fair em­ploy­ment, in­ves­ti­gated about 260 cases of such prac­tices in the first half of this year, 60 per cent more than the 160 cases in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Some 90 em­ploy­ers even­tu­ally had their work pass priv­i­leges sus­pended due to dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices as at Au­gust this year, up from 35 for the whole of last year.</p>
    <p>This means the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) barred them from hir­ing new for­eign­ers or re­new­ing the work passes of ex­ist­ing for­eign staff for a pe­riod of time.</p>
    <p>About 43 per cent of them were iden­ti­fied through data an­a­lyt­ics as part of MOM’s proac­tive in­ves­ti­ga­tion ef­forts. The re­main­ing 57 per cent were iden­ti­fied based on com­plaints re­ceived by the min­istry and Tafep, an MOM spokesman said in re­sponse to media queries.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said the min­istry’s an­a­lyt­ics model helps it proac­tively iden­tify em­ploy­ers who may have pre-se­lected for­eign­ers when hir­ing or not ad­hered to the spirit of the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work job ad­ver­tis­ing re­quire­ment when sub­mit­ting Em­ploy­ment Pass ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Er­rant em­ploy­ers which breach the Tri­par­tite Guide­lines on Fair Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices will be barred from hir­ing new for­eign workers or re­new­ing the work passes of ex­ist­ing ones for 12 months to 24 months, un­der stiffer penal­ties for dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing that took ef­fect this year.</p>
    <p>Ms Chris­tine Loh, di­rec­tor of MOM’s em­ploy­ment stan­dards en­force­ment de­part­ment, said in a media state­ment that the min­istry will con­tinue to raise aware­ness of em­ploy­ment rights and obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>“MOM will also re­main vig­i­lant in in­ves­ti­gat­ing dis­crim­i­na­tory prac­tices and will take er­rant em­ploy­ers to task so as to build fair work­places for all Sin­ga­pore­ans,” she said.</p>
    <p>Tafep general man­ager Faith Li said that Tafep has stepped up ef­forts to scru­ti­nise more cases of po­ten­tial work­place dis­crim­i­na­tion and will con­tinue to work with MOM to take ac­tion against dis­crim­i­na­tory em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Yesterday’s re­port by MOM, Tafep and the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Dis­pute Man­age­ment (TADM) said per­cep­tions of dis­crim­i­na­tion ap­pear to have strength­ened, based on a min­istry sur­vey in 2018.</p>
    <p>The per­cent­age of those who felt there was dis­crim­i­na­tion during their job search process rose to 15 per cent in 2018, up from 10 per cent in 2014. Age-re­lated dis­crim­i­na­tion re­mained the most com­monly per­ceived form, while the big­gest per­cent­age point in­crease in per­ceived dis­crim­i­na­tion was based on per­sonal char­ac­ter­is­tics of gen­der and num­ber of chil­dren.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite the sur­vey find­ing that seven in 10 pri­vate sec­tor firms have struc­tured hu­man re­sources pro­cesses and ob­jec­tive cri­te­ria in their as­sess­ment of job ap­pli­cants.</p>

    <p>MOM will also re­main vig­i­lant in in­ves­ti­gat­ing dis­crim­i­na­tory prac­tices and will take er­rant em­ploy­ers to task so as to build fair work­places for all Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>MS CHRIS­TINE LOH, di­rec­tor of MOM’s em­ploy­ment stan­dards en­force­ment de­part­ment.</p>
    <p>Tay said in a Face­book post yesterday that the is­sue of dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing must con­tinue to be closely watched.</p>
    <p>“On top of ex­ist­ing penal­ties, the Gov­ern­ment could also re­scind pref­er­en­tial tax ben­e­fits from com­pa­nies that con­tinue un­fair re­cruit­ment prac­tices and disal­low them from win­ning pub­lic sec­tor con­tracts, or pub­lish the names of re­cal­ci­trant firms that re­peat­edly fail to show con­certed ef­forts to strengthen the Sin­ga­porean core,” he said.</p>
    <p>The re­port also covered mea­sures taken to pro­tect em­ploy­ees amid busi­ness and work­place chal­lenges brought about by the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Since March, em­ploy­ers with 10 or more em­ploy­ees have had to no­tify MOM if they take cost-sav­ing mea­sures that af­fect em­ploy­ees’ monthly salaries.</p>
    <p>MOM has also re­quired all em­ploy­ers with em­ploy­ees stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries to pay salaries elec­tron­i­cally since April so that workers can re­ceive their pay de­spite move­ment re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>As at end-Au­gust, about 90 per cent of em­ploy­ers had com­plied, up from 76 per cent be­fore the re­quire­ment was in­tro­duced.</p>
    <p>Since May, all con­struc­tion sec­tor em­ploy­ers have also had to sub­mit monthly dec­la­ra­tions on the sta­tus of salary pay­ment to their for­eign em­ploy­ees. MOM has re­ceived a monthly re­sponse rate of 97 per cent from about 14,000 em­ploy­ers, with more than 90 per cent of these declar­ing that they paid salaries promptly.</p>
    <p>TADM fol­lowed up with the re­main­der and re­cov­ered salaries owed to about 9,000 for­eign workers be­tween May and Au­gust, said yesterday’s re­port.</p>
    <p>TACK­LING ER­RANT FIRMS</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment could also re­scind pref­er­en­tial tax ben­e­fits from com­pa­nies that con­tinue un­fair re­cruit­ment prac­tices and disal­low them from win­ning pub­lic sec­tor con­tracts, or pub­lish the names of re­cal­ci­trant firms that re­peat­edly fail to show con­certed ef­forts to strengthen the Sin­ga­porean core.</p>
