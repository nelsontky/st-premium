    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Tik­Tok plans to file a law­suit against the US govern­ment, the com­pany has con­firmed, ar­gu­ing that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s moves to block the app had de­prived it of due process and that it had been un­fairly and in­cor­rectly treated as a se­cu­rity threat.</p>
    <p>The law­suit, which the com­pany con­firmed on Satur­day it plans to file to­day, would amount to the most pub­lic push­back against the United States by Tik­Tok, which is owned by the Chi­nese In­ter­net com­pany ByteDance.</p>
    <p>The com­pany plans to ar­gue that it was not pro­vided due process be­fore the Pres­i­dent’s ex­ec­u­tive or­der to ban the app from the US within 45 days.</p>
    <p>“To en­sure that the rule of law is not dis­carded and that our com­pany and users are treated fairly, we have no choice but to chal­lenge the ex­ec­u­tive or­der through the ju­di­cial sys­tem,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Even though we strongly dis­agree with the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s con­cerns, for nearly a year we have sought to en­gage in good faith to pro­vide a con­struc­tive so­lu­tion,” Mr Josh Gart­ner, a Tik­Tok spokesman, said in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>“What we en­coun­tered in­stead was a lack of due process as the ad­min­is­tra­tion paid no at­ten­tion to facts and tried to in­sert it­self into ne­go­ti­a­tions be­tween pri­vate busi­nesses,” he said.</p>
    <p>For months, Mr Trump has railed against Tik­Tok and its ties to China, ar­gu­ing that the app was a na­tional se­cu­rity threat and that it could share data about its users with the Chi­nese govern­ment.</p>
    <p>On Aug 6, Mr Trump is­sued an ex­ec­u­tive or­der against Tik­Tok, say­ing it would ban trans­ac­tions with the app within 45 days.</p>
    <p>A week later, he is­sued a sep­a­rate ex­ec­u­tive or­der giv­ing ByteDance 90 days to di­vest from its US as­sets and any data that Tik­Tok had gath­ered in the US.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s ac­tions have pushed ByteDance to seek a sale of Tik­Tok’s US op­er­a­tions to a US com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft and Or­a­cle are among those that have re­cently held dis­cus­sions for such a deal. The com­pa­nies re­main in ne­go­ti­a­tions for a po­ten­tial ac­qui­si­tion of Tik­Tok.</p>
    <p>Tik­Tok, which has re­peat­edly de­nied that it shares data with Bei­jing, pre­vi­ously tried to pacify the</p>
    <p>Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion. But as the White House’s ac­tions es­ca­lated, Tik­Tok be­came more crit­i­cal of its moves.</p>
    <p>The White House did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s first ex­ec­u­tive or­der against Tik­Tok draws its le­gal au­thor­ity from the In­ter­na­tional Emer­gency Eco­nomic Pow­ers Act, which al­lows the Pres­i­dent to reg­u­late eco­nomic trans­ac­tions in a na­tional emer­gency. Past ad­min­is­tra­tions have used it to sanc­tion for­eign gov­ern­ments as well as ter­ror­ists, drug king­pins and hack­ers, but never a lead­ing tech­nol­ogy com­pany with global op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Past ad­min­is­tra­tions have also used the au­thor­ity some­what cau­tiously, wary that a le­gal chal­lenge could re­sult in a court cur­tail­ing some of the pres­i­dent’s ex­pan­sive pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Some Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ad­vis­ers have also been con­cerned about such an out­come, but oth­ers view the eco­nomic pow­ers as a kind of blank cheque, giv­ing the ad­min­is­tra­tion ex­pan­sive au­thor­ity to re­strict US com­merce.</p>
    <p>Mr Ja­son Waite, a part­ner at Al­ston and Bird, said the or­der raised se­ri­ous ques­tions, in­clud­ing whether the pro­vi­sion could be used to tar­get peo­ple or com­pa­nies reg­is­tered in the US, even if they had a for­eign par­ent com­pany.</p>
    <p>“Us­ing this au­thor­ity against a Hizbol­lah leader does not present lit­i­ga­tion risk like us­ing this au­thor­ity against a ma­jor global tech­nol­ogy com­pany,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the odds would be in the Pres­i­dent’s favour, but that the ad­min­is­tra­tion had still opened it­self up to the pos­si­bil­ity of hav­ing its eco­nomic pow­ers cur­tailed.</p>
