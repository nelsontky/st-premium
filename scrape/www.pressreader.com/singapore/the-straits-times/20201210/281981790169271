    <p>By opt­ing to in­ter­vene to keep the peace in a multi-re­li­gious so­ci­ety, it has a com­plex job de­fus­ing threats on many fronts from within and abroad</p>
    <p>The French gov­ern­ment’s de­ci­sion, to sup­port the right of the satir­i­cal mag­a­zine Char­lie Hebdo to pub­lish car­toons of­fen­sive to the re­li­gious be­liefs of Mus­lims, has im­pli­cated France in a war be­tween re­li­gious and sec­u­lar ab­so­lutists.</p>
    <p>In re­li­gious ab­so­lutism, the sec­u­lar sphere has no place, and in sec­u­lar ab­so­lutism, the re­li­gious sphere has no place. Re­li­gious ab­so­lutism takes po­lit­i­cal form in the con­fes­sional state, where the idea of cit­i­zen­ship is tied to a set of re­li­gious be­liefs un­der­writ­ten and en­forced by the state.</p>
    <p>At the other ex­treme lies the sec­u­lar ab­so­lutism prac­tised in France. The French in­ter­pre­ta­tion of sec­u­lar­ism, known as laicite, pre­cludes the state from in­ter­ven­ing in in­tra- or in­ter-re­li­gious dis­putes or in at­tacks on any or all re­li­gions.</p>
    <p>Un­like France, Sin­ga­pore’s model of sec­u­lar­ism calls for an in­ter­ven­tion­ist ap­proach to mat­ters of re­li­gious be­lief and non-be­lief. This coun­try en­sures that no faith com­mu­nity in­sults an­other, and that non-be­liev­ers do not at­tack the faith­ful (or are at­tacked in turn).</p>
    <p>Un­like ab­so­lutist con­fes­sional coun­tries, the rights and re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of cit­i­zen­ship here are not pred­i­cated on re­li­gious af­fil­i­a­tion. But un­like ab­so­lutist sec­u­lar dis­pen­sa­tions, Sin­ga­pore does not per­mit the non-re­li­gious to den­i­grate deeply held be­liefs of faith com­mu­ni­ties. No one is pros­e­cuted for be­ing an athe­ist or an ag­nos­tic, but no one is al­lowed to trans­gress the bor­ders ly­ing be­tween be­lief and un­be­lief either.</p>
    <p>The bot­tom line is that “the Char­lie Hebdo types of car­toons will not be al­lowed in Sin­ga­pore, whether they are about Catholi­cism or Protes­tants or</p>
    <p>Is­lam or Hin­dus” be­cause free speech here “stops at the bound­ary of giv­ing of­fence to re­li­gion”, as Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam puts it.</p>
    <p>The ac­tive role of the Sin­ga­pore state helps to hold the un­easy bal­ance be­tween the re­li­gious and sec­u­lar spheres. That role stops the mil­i­tant sec­u­lar­ism sym­bol­ised by Char­lie Hebdo from lead­ing to the pre­ventable loss of in­no­cent lives, as seen in the con­demnable ter­ror­ist at­tacks in France and Aus­tria re­cently.</p>
    <p>What lies be­hind the Sin­ga­pore way of sec­u­lar­ism? Both its past and its present. The Maria Her­togh ri­ots of 1950 and the racial vi­o­lence of 1964 and 1969 are re­minders of the fault lines that if not man­aged with care could al­low seem­ingly small in­ci­dents to es­ca­late into blood­shed if rad­i­cal­ism of the re­li­gious or sec­u­lar kind is not held in check.</p>
    <p>To­day, the pres­sure on Sin­ga­pore is in some ways greater than that on France. There, the cur­rent con­tro­versy essen­tially in­volves the state and Mus­lim opin­ion, whose ex­treme fringes have re­sorted to vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is a city-state that is home to ad­her­ents of the world’s ma­jor re­li­gions. It has to en­sure that re­li­gious zealots of what­ever per­sua­sion do not latch on ex­ter­nal events to push their agenda, not an easy job when ac­cess to in­cen­di­ary global in­for­ma­tion and hate speech lies but a mouse click way.</p>
    <p>Ar­rests of rad­i­calised Mus­lims here un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act over the years are one in­di­ca­tion of the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>But ex­trem­ism is not re­stricted to Mus­lims. Rad­i­cal Sri Lankan, Thai and Myan­mar Bud­dhist monks have also con­trib­uted to an at­mos­phere of Is­lam­o­pho­bia in South and South-east Asia in re­cent years. The Sin­ga­pore re­sponse has been to be im­par­tial in crack­ing down on threats to its re­li­gious har­mony, no mat­ter what their source. For ex­am­ple, sev­eral Chris­tian and Mus­lim for­eign preach­ers have been barred from speak­ing here be­cause of the di­vi­sive ef­fects of their ex­treme views on re­li­gious co­ex­is­tence.</p>
    <p>That im­par­tial­ity lies at the heart of Sin­ga­pore’s cred­i­bil­ity as a sec­u­lar state which pro­tects all faiths from ex­trem­ists within and with­out.</p>
    <p>In man­ag­ing in­ter-faith re­la­tions, Sin­ga­pore ad­heres to the prin­ci­ple of pub­lic rea­son. Among other things, pub­lic rea­son re­quires cit­i­zens to frame so­cial and po­lit­i­cal ar­gu­ments in a way that oth­ers would un­der­stand, if not agree with, re­gard­less of their pri­vate re­li­gious be­liefs. Sin­ga­pore does not ban­ish re­li­gion from the pub­lic sphere but it does not al­low faith to mo­nop­o­lise that sphere.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­ham­mad Alami Musa of the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity says that the “unique­ness of Sin­ga­pore’s prac­tice of sec­u­lar­ism lies in its clever ap­pli­ca­tion of the prin­ci­ple of be­ing equidis­tant in ac­com­mo­dat­ing the spe­cial needs and in­ter­ests of the var­i­ous re­li­gious groups, as well as in giv­ing some space to re­li­gion in the pub­lic square with­out caus­ing dishar­mony”.</p>
    <p>He adds that “Sin­ga­pore’s brand of sec­u­lar­ism is ‘re­li­gion friendly’ and, be­cause of this, the state and re­li­gion have en­joyed a gen­er­ally am­i­ca­ble re­la­tion­ship”.</p>
    <p>Will that amity last? It is dif­fi­cult to know be­cause anti-sec­u­lar forces are on the as­cen­dant glob­ally. Turkey, once the most sec­u­lar of Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity states, has de­cided to turn the iconic Ha­gia Sophia, which went from be­ing a church to a mosque and then a mu­seum over 15 cen­turies, into a place of Sunni Mus­lim wor­ship.</p>
    <p>In In­dia, a turn to abra­sive re­li­gios­ity has cap­tured the po­lit­i­cal imag­i­na­tion of mil­lions. In­di­an­ness is be­ing re­de­fined in re­li­gious terms. “Sec­u­lar­ism” has be­come a sus­pect word to many in the Hindu-ma­jor­ity na­tion.</p>
    <p>It can­not be said that such trends will not have an ef­fect on Sin­ga­pore, a city-state open to the glob­alised in­ter­ac­tion of re­li­gions as much as of economies.</p>
    <p>True, Sin­ga­pore’s leg­isla­tive ar­se­nal in­cludes the Main­te­nance of Re­li­gious Har­mony Act and the Sedi­tion Act.</p>
    <p>How­ever, na­tional laws can go only so far in an In­ter­net age when the seam­less glob­al­i­sa­tion of in­for­ma­tion in­cludes the dis­sem­i­na­tion of de­con­tex­tu­alised dis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>On the In­ter­net, the Syr­ian war is fought in the minds of some im­pres­sion­able Sin­ga­pore­ans, as if this coun­try is re­spon­si­ble for the mas­sacre of in­no­cents in Syria. When they visu­alise vi­o­lence, Syria does not win: Sin­ga­pore loses.</p>
    <p>The in­flow of new im­mi­grants, while wel­come in it­self, also de­mands that they be ac­cul­tur­ated into the norms and prac­tices of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety. The re­li­gious and racial bag­gage which they bring with them should not be al­lowed to add an ex­tra bur­den to man­ag­ing multi-re­li­gious ex­is­tence in this coun­try.</p>
    <p>In mak­ing that point, a re­port by the In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies adds that, “in a post­mod­ern age, re­li­gious au­thor­ity is likely to be dis­persed with more splin­ter groups that have their own in­ter­pre­ta­tion of re­li­gion”. Es­tab­lished re­li­gious struc­tures should “steer them clear from ten­den­cies that may desta­bilise re­li­gious har­mony”.</p>
    <p>These chal­lenges to sec­u­lar­ism with Sin­ga­pore char­ac­ter­is­tics can­not be taken lightly. There is no as­sur­ance that the present or­der of things will last. How­ever, it could be ex­pected to last so long as the ma­jor­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans be­lieve firmly in the sep­a­ra­tion of re­li­gion and state.</p>
