    <p>The Na­tional Wages Council should be able to reach con­sen­sus in the com­ing weeks, said Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary for Man­power Aubeck Kam yesterday.</p>
    <p>Mr Kam, a mem­ber of the council, said the is­sues of flex­i­bil­ity, such as in how em­ploy­ers and work­ers re­spond to the chang­ing labour mar­ket con­di­tions, as well as how wages should be ad­justed as and when busi­nesses re­cover, are be­ing dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>“We’re mak­ing good progress in com­ing to an agree­ment on those in the weeks to come,” he said dur­ing a pre­sen­ta­tion at the HR Tech Fes­ti­val Asia on­line con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The tri­par­tite council, which com­prises rep­re­sen­ta­tives from the Govern­ment, em­ployer groups and unions, had made its an­nual rec­om­men­da­tions in March.</p>
    <p>But it was re­con­vened last month as the labour mar­ket sit­u­a­tion wors­ened ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The council had orig­i­nally aimed to re­lease its up­dated guide­lines by this month.</p>
    <p>When asked about the de­lay, a Min­istry of Man­power spokesman told The Straits Times that the council’s de­lib­er­a­tions typ­i­cally take around two months, although the most re­cent rec­om­men­da­tions in March were com­pleted in a shorter time.</p>
    <p>Mr Kam also out­lined Sin­ga­pore’s re­sponse to the labour mar­ket chal­lenges brought on by the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>It has piv­oted from re­ly­ing en­tirely on wage sup­port through the Jobs Sup­port Scheme to open­ing up the new $1 bil­lion Jobs Growth In­cen­tive.</p>
    <p>This sig­nals that the Govern­ment will sup­port busi­nesses to cre­ate jobs early and that they should not hold back from hir­ing lo­cal work­ers.</p>
    <p>It has be­come clearer that in­dus­tries and busi­nesses across the world are adapt­ing to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, and some are un­likely to re­turn any time soon to oper­at­ing as they did be­fore the pan­demic, said Mr Kam.</p>
    <p>But since it was not known ear­lier this year how quickly de­mand would re­bound, it made sense then to fo­cus on wage sup­port to help com­pa­nies keep their work­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Jobs Council was also set up in June to push for a large bank of job, trainee­ship and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties, ca­ter­ing to all sec­tors and skill lev­els.</p>
    <p>Mr Kam noted that although the mea­sures have not com­pletely shielded Sin­ga­pore’s labour mar­ket from the im­pact of the pan­demic, they have helped to mod­er­ate the ef­fects.</p>
    <p>He added that trust be­tween the tri­par­tite part­ners has also en­abled dif­fi­cult de­ci­sions to be taken for the greater good.</p>
    <p>He cited how the re­cent set­tle­ment be­tween Sin­ga­pore Air­lines and the Air Line Pi­lots As­so­ci­a­tion – Sin­ga­pore saw some of the pi­lots tak­ing sig­nif­i­cant pay cuts in ex­change for the com­pany com­mit­ting not to re­trench any more pi­lots un­til 2022.</p>
    <p>“The abil­ity to reach this suc­cess­ful agree­ment shows that tri­par­tite trust re­mains un­shaken de­spite the very chal­leng­ing con­di­tions that all par­ties have had to face this year,” Mr Kam said.</p>
