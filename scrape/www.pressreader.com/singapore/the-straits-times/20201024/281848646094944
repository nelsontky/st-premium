    <p>NEW YORK • The US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) has ap­proved Gilead Sciences’ an­tivi­ral drug remde­sivir, mak­ing it the first drug to ob­tain for­mal clear­ance for treat­ing the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors had granted an emer­gency-use au­tho­ri­sa­tion for remde­sivir ear­lier this year, and since then, the drug has be­come a widely used ther­apy in hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>It was given to US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump this month when he was di­ag­nosed with the virus.</p>
    <p>Thurs­day’s ap­proval for remde­sivir, sold un­der the brand name Vek­lury, will al­low Gilead to mar­ket the drug and talk about its ben­e­fits to doc­tors, nurses and pa­tients.</p>
    <p>That could help so­lid­ify its po­si­tion as a go-to medicine for Covid-19 pa­tients even as other drugs for the dis­ease be­gin to reach the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The nod for remde­sivir came de­spite the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) last week say­ing that the drug did not have a sub­stan­tial ef­fect on pa­tients’ length of hos­pi­tal stay or chances of sur­vival in a global trial. That study has not been re­viewed by out­side ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Gilead has crit­i­cised the WHO study. In a let­ter posted on the com­pany’s web­site, chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Mer­dad Parsey said the find­ings do not negate other re­sults.</p>
    <p>Remde­sivir has be­come the stan­dard of care for pa­tients hos­pi­talised with se­vere Covid-19 even though it has not been shown to im­prove sur­vival. The drug also has not been proven to sig­nif­i­cantly help mod­er­ately ill pa­tients, and many doc­tors re­main wary of us­ing it in those with less se­vere ill­ness.</p>
    <p>FDA’s ap­proval is based on a US gov­ern­ment-spon­sored trial in­volv­ing more than 1,000 hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients that found that those who re­ceived the drug re­cov­ered about five days faster than those who got a placebo.</p>
    <p>The over­all side ef­fect rate was sim­i­lar to the placebo in the study. The most com­mon side ef­fects are nau­sea and el­e­vated liver en­zymes, ac­cord­ing to the prod­uct’s la­bel.</p>
    <p>In the US on Thurs­day, sev­eral states, many of them in the Mid­west, re­ported record sin­gle-day in­creases in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, fur­ther ev­i­dence that the pan­demic is ac­cel­er­at­ing anew as cooler weather takes hold in many parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>In­di­ana, North Dakota, Illi­nois, Mon­tana, Ok­la­homa, Utah and Ohio posted daily records, while Florida re­ported more than 5,500 new cases, its high­est sin­gle-day in­crease since Aug 15.</p>
    <p>Twenty-eight states have re­ported their daily record high of Covid-19 cases in this month alone.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the num­ber of coro­n­avirus deaths re­ported across the coun­try reached its high­est in two months. In­creases in deaths tend to trail spikes in new in­fec­tions by sev­eral weeks.</p>
    <p>Since the pan­demic reached the US ear­lier this year, the na­tion has lost more than 222,000 lives, the world’s high­est to­tal.</p>
    <p>The au­tumn resur­gence and dire pre­dic­tions that the virus’ spread would fur­ther ac­cel­er­ate in the cold win­ter months have once again cast a harsh spotlight on Mr Trump’s han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With less than two weeks be­fore the elec­tion, Mr Trump’s seem­ingly dis­mis­sive ap­proach to the virus has clouded his re-elec­tion prospects.</p>
    <p>Along with spikes in cases and deaths, the num­ber of Covid-19 pa­tients in hos­pi­tals is also at a twom­onth high. There are more than 40,000 hos­pi­talised pa­tients now, up 33 per cent from Oct 1.</p>
    <p>In Wis­con­sin, a Covid-19 hot spot and a piv­otal bat­tle­ground state that could help de­cide the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, hos­pi­tals are feel­ing the strain from the surge in cases.</p>
    <p>“We have a tremen­dous vol­ume of pa­tients in our hos­pi­tals right now,” Dr Jeff Pothof, an emer­gency medicine physi­cian at Univer­sity of Wis­con­sin Health in Madi­son, said.</p>
    <p>“I think a lot of the hos­pi­tal sys­tems in Wis­con­sin are feel­ing re­ally stretched... It’s that tightrope of meet­ing the need of Covid pa­tients but not po­ten­tially harm­ing pa­tients who don’t have Covid be­cause we need to think about post­pon­ing their care.”</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has also weighed on the fi­nances of mil­lions of Amer­i­cans, who say they are barely get­ting by as Washington wran­gles over an­other round of fi­nan­cial aid.</p>
    <p>Chicago Mayor Lori Light­foot on Thurs­day im­posed a 10pm cur­few for bars, restau­rants and non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses in the city for at least the next two weeks, start­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
