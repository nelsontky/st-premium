    <p>Dr Ryuichi Morishita of Osaka Univer­sity’s med­i­cal school is a tac­i­turn man with a big vi­sion of de­vel­op­ing a DNA vac­cine against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>But the odds are stacked against the clin­i­cal gene ther­a­pist. For one thing, he is chart­ing a rad­i­cal path in the field of bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals: The idea of DNA vac­cines is so novel that they are not yet ap­proved for hu­man use.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, while not­ing that many as­pects of the hu­man body’s im­mune sys­tem re­sponse to a DNA vac­cine are not yet un­der­stood, said: “This has not im­peded sig­nif­i­cant progress to­wards the use of this type of vac­cine in hu­mans.”</p>
    <p>Dr Morishita is ex­per­i­ment­ing with DNA vac­cines against in­fec­tious dis­eases like Covid-19, as well as in­tractable dis­eases like can­cer and hy­per­ten­sion.</p>
    <p>Un­like con­ven­tional vac­cines, which in­volve in­ject­ing ei­ther a weak­ened or in­ac­ti­vated ver­sion of the virus or the pathogen to trig­ger the im­mune re­sponse, DNA vac­cines en­code the ge­netic pro­tein of the tar­get pathogen.</p>
    <p>This means that only the DNA code of the dis­ease – and not the pathogen it­self – gets in­jected di­rectly into the hu­man cell to in­duce the pro­duc­tion of an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>Dr Morishita, 58, said last week that such vac­cines will be eas­ier to de­velop since they do not in­volve cul­ti­vat­ing the virus it­self. They can also be pro­duced in weeks, com­pared with the months that con­ven­tional vac­cines take, he said.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine may take three or four doses to be ef­fec­tive, but each dose may cost as low as US$4 (S$5), he said.</p>
    <p>Some have ques­tioned the sci­ence be­hind his project. But the po­ten­tial for a Covid-19 DNA vac­cine has tre­bled the mar­ket val­u­a­tion of his Osaka-based com­pany AnGes Inc to 161.9 bil­lion yen (S$2.1 bil­lion) on Wed­nes­day from March.</p>
    <p>Dr Morishita, born in Soja city in Okayama pre­fec­ture, earned his med­i­cal de­gree and PhD from Osaka Univer­sity, where he has spent al­most his en­tire ca­reer ex­cept for a five-year Stan­ford Univer­sity stint.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese gov­ern­ment is back­ing his re­search, devot­ing 11.4 bil­lion yen in grants to AnGes to de­velop and pro­duce the DNA vac­cine against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine has un­der­gone suc­cess­ful hu­man clin­i­cal tri­als in Osaka, with larger-scale tests planned across Ja­pan and the Asia- Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Dr Morishita ex­pects the vac­cine to be ready by the first half of next year, and said it will be ef­fec­tive even if the coro­n­avirus were to mu­tate, given that the var­i­ous strains of the virus have sim­i­lar ge­netic codes.</p>
