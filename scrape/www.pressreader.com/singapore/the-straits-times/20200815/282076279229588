    <p>Five stu­dents keen to be­gin their over­seas stud­ies in China next month will have to wait a while more be­fore they can fly over, due to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The re­cip­i­ents of the Sin­ga­pore Fed­er­a­tion of Chi­nese Clan As­so­ci­a­tions (SFCCA) Schol­ar­ship will likely be pur­su­ing their univer­sity de­grees at the pres­ti­gious Ts­inghua and Pek­ing uni­ver­si­ties through on­line learn­ing in­def­i­nitely when school starts.</p>
    <p>Ms Shi Xinyao, 18; Ms Re­becca Yang Xinze, 19; Ms Rachel Lee Xin Ying, 18; and Ms Pek Ning Xuan, 19, re­ceived the schol­ar­ships at SFCCA’s Toa Payoh head­quar­ters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The fifth re­cip­i­ent, Ms Kuo Pei Yu, 19, who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore at the start of this month after five months vol­un­teer­ing in a Tai­wan vil­lage as an English teacher, could not at­tend the cer­e­mony as she is serv­ing her stay-home no­tice, which ends next Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The five were se­lected from 16 ap­pli­cants this year, more than the 13 ap­pli­cants last year, even as the Covid-19 pan­demic af­fected the study plans of some.</p>
    <p>The bond-free schol­ar­ship funds up to $15,000 for an aca­demic year, in­clud­ing air­fare, school fees, ac­com­mo­da­tion, in­sur­ance and liv­ing ex­penses, and each re­cip­i­ent is re­quired to com­mit to a work at­tach­ment pro­gramme with the SFCCA or its mem­ber or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Kuo, who spoke to The Straits Times on the phone after yes­ter­day’s cer­e­mony, said she would pre­fer to be able to study in China rather than re­motely.</p>
    <p>“One part that at­tracted me to study in China was the chance to im­merse my­self in its cul­ture and en­vi­ron­ment, and I had the op­tion to stay with lo­cal stu­dents and get to in­ter­act with them,” said Ms Kuo, who has yet to de­cide her ma­jor but will be study­ing at Yuan­pei Col­lege at Pek­ing Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Ms Shi said she hopes to be able to head to China soon to pur­sue lib­eral arts, also at Yuan­pei Col­lege. “For some lessons, I heard that we can go out to ex­pe­ri­ence China’s cities, so this is real-life ex­pe­ri­ence that I would be miss­ing out on (as a re­sult of re­mote study­ing),” she said.</p>
    <p>All five re­cip­i­ents have yet to suc­cess­fully ap­ply for stu­dent visas.</p>
    <p>Due to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, the Chi­nese Em­bassy in Sin­ga­pore is ac­cept­ing visa ap­pli­ca­tions only for nec­es­sary eco­nomic, trade and scitech ac­tiv­i­ties and ur­gent hu­man­i­tar­ian needs, ac­cord­ing to a no­tice on its web­site dated July 17 this year.</p>
    <p>The stu­dents will have to adapt to the on­line learn­ing sit­u­a­tion, said Ms Pek, who will be ma­jor­ing in hu­man­i­ties and so­cial sci­ences at Ts­inghua Univer­sity. She is the only one of the five who is from River Val­ley High School. The oth­ers are from Hwa Chong In­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor­ity of ap­pli­cants each year come from Hwa Chong, River Val­ley and Dun­man High School, said SFCCA pres­i­dent Tan Aik Hock.</p>
    <p>The fed­er­a­tion has been gath­er­ing more sup­port from the in­di­vid­ual clan as­so­ci­a­tions and hopes to give one or two more schol­ar­ships to fu­ture co­horts, he added.</p>
    <p>He also an­nounced that an SFCCA Schol­ars Net­work com­pris­ing the dif­fer­ent batches of schol­ar­ship hold­ers has been set up, mark­ing 10 years since the schol­ar­ship was in­tro­duced. The net­work should be a plat­form the schol­ar­ship hold­ers can lever­age for op­por­tu­ni­ties to con­tinue learn­ing, grow­ing and con­tribut­ing back to the Chi­nese com­mu­nity, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>Ms Yang, who will pur­sue eco­nom­ics and fi­nance at Ts­inghua, said she hopes to come up with events and ideas to bet­ter en­gage young peo­ple and pique their in­ter­est in Chi­nese cul­ture dur­ing her fu­ture work at­tach­ment pro­gramme.</p>
