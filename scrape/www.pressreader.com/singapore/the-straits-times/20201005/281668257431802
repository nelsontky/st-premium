    <p>Sen­tosa’s beaches were filled with peo­ple yes­ter­day, about two weeks be­fore guests will be re­quired to book their vis­its dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>Groups of friends and fam­i­lies were spot­ted at Palawan, Siloso and Tan­jong beaches, where some sun­tanned, played vol­ley­ball or held pic­nics. Oth­ers swam or kayaked close to the shore.</p>
    <p>For univer­sity stu­dents Char­lene Lee, 19, and Ni­cole Lin, 20, the up­com­ing reser­va­tion re­quire­ment was one of the rea­sons for their visit to Siloso Beach yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“In the fu­ture, we would be too lazy to book,” Ms Lin said.</p>
    <p>Since July, the is­land’s three beaches have been seg­mented into seven zones, each with a ca­pac­ity limit rang­ing be­tween 100 and 350 peo­ple to al­low for safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The zones have spe­cific en­try and exit points, where vis­i­tors are re­quired to check in and check out us­ing the SafeEn­try dig­i­tal sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, other safe man­age­ment mea­sures were in place at the</p>
    <p>beaches, for ex­am­ple, “safety rings” which in­di­cated spots where groups of up to five may gather.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors were also seen pa­trolling the beaches.</p>
    <p>In the Palawan and Siloso beach zones, vis­i­tors were is­sued with wrist­bands upon ad­mis­sion. These al­lowed them ac­cess to only the re­spec­tive zone where they had been given the bands.</p>
    <p>A Sen­tosa De­vel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion (SDC) spokesman told The Straits Times that the wrist­bands have been pro­gres­sively in­tro­duced to fa­mil­iarise Sen­tosa’s beach­go­ers with the up­com­ing book­ing re­quire­ment.</p>
    <p>From Oct 17, beach­go­ers will have to make on­line book­ings ahead of their vis­its dur­ing peak pe­ri­ods, such as week­ends and pub­lic hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last month, SDC said the on­line reser­va­tion sys­tem will be­gin ac­cept­ing book­ings from Satur­day, for vis­its com­menc­ing on Oct 17. It will be tri­alled for an ini­tial pe­riod of three months.</p>
    <p>Guests may book their en­try to a zone up to seven days be­fore their in­tended beach visit, sub­ject to ca­pac­ity lim­its. They may choose from two time slots – in the morn­ing (8am to 1pm), or in the af­ter­noon (2pm to 7pm ) – and make reser­va­tions for up to five peo­ple in each book­ing.</p>
    <p>On the day of the visit, guests would re­ceive wrist­bands at the beach en­try kiosk of their se­lected zone, af­ter pre­sent­ing their book­ing con­fir­ma­tion e-mail for ver­i­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Some beach­go­ers said the book­ing re­quire­ment would de­ter them from vis­it­ing the beaches.</p>
    <p>Univer­sity stu­dent Ter­ence Lee, 24, who goes to the beaches to get a tan, ex­pects he will visit them less fre­quently once book­ing is needed.</p>
    <p>“Usu­ally, I just come when I am free... I do not know my sched­ule in advance,” said Mr Lee, who also works part time.</p>
    <p>A 40-year-old fi­nan­cial con­troller who wanted to be known only as Mr Lim said book­ing is nec­es­sary to pre­vent sit­u­a­tions where peo­ple would have to wait in line to en­ter over­ca­pac­ity beaches.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple would not waste their trip com­ing down,” he said.</p>
    <p>Since July, the is­land’s three beaches have been seg­mented into seven zones, each with a ca­pac­ity limit rang­ing be­tween 100 and 350 peo­ple to al­low for safe dis­tanc­ing. The zones have spe­cific en­try and exit points, where vis­i­tors are re­quired to check in and check out us­ing the SafeEn­try dig­i­tal sys­tem.</p>
