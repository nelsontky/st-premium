    <p>It is easy to come to the con­clu­sion that for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers (FDWs) are badly treated and abused, based on the slew of ad­verse news re­ports de­tail­ing lo­cal em­ploy­ers who treat their FDWs in­hu­manely.</p>
    <p>Such re­ports do not nec­es­sar­ily re­flect the sit­u­a­tion on the ground (Peo­ple be­com­ing in­or­di­nately de­mand­ing towards maids, by Madam Win­nie Foo Hui Lin,</p>
    <p>Oct 29).</p>
    <p>Hav­ing done al­most 40 years of med­i­cal screen­ing for FDWs, they have told me in ca­sual con­ver­sa­tion that while em­ploy­ers be­long­ing to the older gen­er­a­tion were used to chores be­ing per­formed man­u­ally – such as hand-wash­ing of clothes and scrub­bing the floor on one’s knees – th­ese prac­tices are far less preva­lent now.</p>
    <p>Younger and bet­ter-ed­u­cated first-time em­ploy­ers are more at­tuned to mod­ern con­ve­niences and user-aligned prac­tices. They at­tend man­dated cour­ses be­fore they hire an FDW and are well aware that per­ceived ill-treat­ment will bar them from fu­ture hir­ing of FDWs, with puni­tive sen­tenc­ing for se­vere abuse.</p>
    <p>For ev­ery case where we shake our heads at how some em­ploy­ers can be so cruel, un­em­pa­thetic and in­hu­mane towards their do­mes­tic helpers, there are oth­ers in which the helpers are em­braced as friends or part of the ex­tended fam­ily and treated in­or­di­nately well. But th­ese are not the cases that make the news.</p>
    <p>Hard-work­ing and adroit maids with a higher emo­tional quo­tient tend to be bet­ter ap­pre­ci­ated and treated. And when re­spon­si­ble em­ploy­ers give FDWs a rea­son­able work­load, they tend to work harder, even with­out in­ces­sant scold­ing.</p>
