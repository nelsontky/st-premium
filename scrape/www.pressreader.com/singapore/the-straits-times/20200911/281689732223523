    <p>Lo­cal sci­en­tists have de­vel­oped an in­te­grated mon­i­tor­ing sys­tem that can be eas­ily at­tached to any face mask in or­der to mon­i­tor the wearer for health in­di­ca­tors as­so­ci­ated with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Sen­sors pick up skin tem­per­a­ture, blood oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion, blood pres­sure and heart rate – all of which are pa­ram­e­ters as­so­ci­ated with coro­n­aviruses.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Loh Xian Jun, who is one of the sci­en­tists be­hind the in­ven­tion, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that the in­spi­ra­tion for the sys­tem came around the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“We saw that when Covid-19 pa­tients were in iso­la­tion wards, the front-line work­ers had to go in and take tem­per­a­ture read­ings and blood oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion every 30 min­utes or so to mon­i­tor their vi­tal signs,” said Prof Loh, who is an ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor at the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search’s (A*Star) In­sti­tute of Ma­te­ri­als Re­search and En­gi­neer­ing.</p>
    <p>“This also co­in­cided with the time when we saw find­ings that the virus was present in var­i­ous parts of the hos­pi­tals... So we were won­der­ing if there was a way to help our frontline work­ers and to re­duce the risk that they face,” he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Loh said nurses also have to drag big and bulky equip­ment from room to room while car­ry­ing out such mon­i­tor­ing, which is not only in­con­ve­nient but also in­creases the risk of spread­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>In hos­pi­tals, such smart masks could be given to Covid-19 pa­tients, al­low­ing staff to mon­i­tor their vi­tal signs re­motely, re­duc­ing the risk of in­fec­tion for front-line work­ers.</p>
    <p>To­gether with Pro­fes­sor Chen Xiaodong from the School of Ma­te­ri­als Sci­ence and En­gi­neer­ing at the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, and a team of fel­low sci­en­tists, Prof Loh pro­duced a se­ries of sen­sors.</p>
    <p>But plac­ing the thumb-size sen­sors on the inside of a mask would be un­com­fort­able for the wearer, so the team in­te­grated them into an ar­ti­fi­cial skin-like sub­strate.</p>
    <p>Prof Chen said a later ver­sion of the sys­tem, which in­te­grates all three sen­sors into one chip, is cur­rently be­ing tested.</p>
    <p>They also added a Blue­tooth de­vice, al­low­ing real-time data to be trans­mit­ted to a smart­phone.</p>
    <p>The sub­strate is made from a poly­mer ma­te­rial sim­i­lar to the one used in su­per balls, a toy pop­u­lar with chil­dren for its abil­ity to bounce high.</p>
    <p>By in­te­grat­ing the chip into the elas­tic ma­te­rial, it al­lows the wearer to feel more com­fort­able but also in­creases the sen­si­tiv­ity of the chip.</p>
    <p>The ex­tremely flex­i­ble and durable ma­te­rial, which is wa­ter­re­sis­tant, also pro­tects the chip, al­low­ing it to be reused mul­ti­ple times, said Prof Chen.</p>
    <p>Prof Loh added that the de­vice can be sewn into the cheek area of a reg­u­lar re­us­able or dis­pos­able face mask. It could the­o­ret­i­cally be washed and reused along with the mask.</p>
    <p>The team said the Blue­tooth func­tion al­lows their sys­tem to not only be use­ful to in­di­vid­u­als who are mon­i­tor­ing their own health, but also po­ten­tially those over­see­ing the health of pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Prof Loh said, in­te­grat­ing the sys­tem into the face masks worn by mi­grant work­ers could com­ple­ment ex­ist­ing telemedici­ne ef­forts to mon­i­tor health trends in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The re­searchers are plan­ning to test their sys­tem in clin­i­cal tri­als by the end of this month, with hopes to bring it to the mar­ket in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Prof Chen said the chips and sys­tem are rel­a­tively sim­ple to pro­duce, and that all the ma­te­ri­als needed to make them can be sourced lo­cally.</p>
    <p>He added that un­der the cur­rent lab-scale pro­duc­tion lev­els, it costs about $50 to make one of the sys­tems – but if pro­duc­tion is ramped up on a mass scale, it could cost less than $20.</p>
    <p>Prof Loh said that cur­rently, the pri­or­ity is to dis­trib­ute the mon­i­tor­ing sys­tem when it is ready to frontline work­ers and pa­tients in hos­pi­tals, and for it to be used in dor­mi­to­ries, be­fore it is made avail­able to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Be­yond Covid-19, the re­searchers hope to use the mon­i­tor­ing sys­tem for healthy peo­ple as well in or­der to col­lect data to pre­dict health trends.</p>
    <p>They are also work­ing on adding another sen­sor to the mask to de­tect and an­a­lyse var­i­ous par­ti­cles in saliva droplets.</p>
    <p>Prof Loh said: “My wish is that this mask will con­trib­ute a lit­tle to help the front-line work­ers lower their risk of ex­po­sure. We also hope to demon­strate that our re­search will be use­ful to Singapore and help in some way with this pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Prof Chen added: “We hope that this re­search can help lo­cals, and mit­i­gate the im­pact of the pan­demic. I also hope it can help lower the risk posed by Covid-19 to the com­mu­nity here.”</p>
    <p>We saw that when Covid-19 pa­tients were in iso­la­tion wards, the front-line work­ers had to go in and take tem­per­a­ture read­ings and blood oxy­gen sat­u­ra­tion every 30 min­utes or so to mon­i­tor their vi­tal signs... This also co­in­cided with the time when we saw find­ings that the virus was present in var­i­ous parts of the hos­pi­tals... So we were won­der­ing if there was a way to help our front-line work­ers and to re­duce the risk that they face.</p>
