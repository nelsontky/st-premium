    <p>NEW YORK A grow­ing num­ber of em­ploy­ers in the United States are de­lay­ing re­turn-to-of­fice dates once again, to the sum­mer of 2021 at the ear­li­est, with the coro­n­avirus still surg­ing in some parts of the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Google was one of the first to an­nounce that July 2021 was its re­turn-to-of­fice date. Uber, Slack and Airbnb soon jumped on the band­wagon.</p>
    <p>In the past week, Mi­crosoft, Tar­get, Ford Mo­tor and The New York Times said they, too, had post­poned the re­turn of in-per­son work to next sum­mer and ac­knowl­edged the in­evitable: The pan­demic is not go­ing away any­time soon.</p>
    <p>“Let’s just bite the bul­let,” said Ms Joan Burke, the chief peo­ple of­fi­cer of DocuSign in San Fran­cisco. In Au­gust, her com­pany, which man­ages elec­tronic doc­u­ment sig­na­tures, de­cided it would al­low its 5,200 em­ploy­ees to work from home un­til June 2021.</p>
    <p>Many more com­pa­nies are ex­pected to de­lay their re­turn-to-of­fice dates to keep work­ers safe.</p>
    <p>And work­ers said they were in no rush to go back, with 73 per cent of US em­ploy­ees fear­ing that be­ing in their work­place could pose a risk to their per­sonal health and safety, ac­cord­ing to a study by Wakefield Re­search com­mis­sioned by En­voy, a work­place tech­nol­ogy com­pany.</p>
    <p>More com­pa­nies are also say­ing that they will in­sti­tute per­ma­nent work-from-home poli­cies so em­ploy­ees do not ever have to come into the of­fice again.</p>
    <p>In May, Face­book was one of the first to an­nounce that it would al­low many em­ploy­ees to work re­motely even af­ter the pan­demic. Twit­ter, Coin­base and Shopify have also said they would do so. On Fri­day, Mi­crosoft an­nounced it would also be part of that shift.</p>
    <p>With the new dates an­nounced, Har­vard Busi­ness School pro­fes­sor Tsedal Nee­ley, who stud­ies re­mote work, said peo­ple can fi­nally start ad­just­ing from a tem­po­rary “grin and bear it” ap­proach to a per­ma­nent shift. Suc­cess­ful com­pa­nies “have be­gun to think about longterm strat­egy rather than ‘Let’s just sur­vive our cri­sis,’” she said.</p>
    <p>Much of cor­po­rate Amer­ica is now fol­low­ing the lead of Sil­i­con Val­ley tech com­pa­nies. Face­book has set the tone in plan­ning for per­ma­nent re­mote work, while Google es­tab­lished the July 2021 tar­get date for re­turn­ing to the of­fice.</p>
    <p>“I hope this will of­fer the flex­i­bil­ity you need to bal­ance work with tak­ing care of your­selves and your loved ones over the next 12 months,” Google’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Sun­dar Pichai wrote in an -email to em­ploy­ees about the July 2021 date.</p>
    <p>Ms Burke said, how­ever, peo­ple may miss the so­cial in­ter­ac­tion of an of­fice space. Zoom “is not the same thing, and it’s ex­haust­ing”, she said.</p>
    <p>Other com­pa­nies that have de­layed their re­turns to the of­fice un­til next sum­mer of­ten face a more com­pli­cated de­ci­sion be­cause their work­forces are not just made up of white-col­lar en­gi­neers, un­like those of In­ter­net com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Ford said last week that its de­ci­sion to hold off on back in-per­son of­fice work through June next year would ap­ply to its roughly 32,000 em­ploy­ees in North Amer­ica who are al­ready work­ing re­motely. The com­pany, which has about 188,000 em­ploy­ees, said the pol­icy does not ap­ply to fac­tory staff.</p>
    <p>A push to all-com­pany re­mote work can also be par­tic­u­larly dif­fi­cult for com­pa­nies with pre­dom­i­nantly young work­forces, said Mr Andy Eich­feld, chief human re­sources and ad­min­is­tra­tive of­fi­cer at credit card com­pany Dis­cover, which told em­ploy­ees on Sept 29 they would not need to re­turn to the of­fice be­fore next June.</p>
    <p>“A younger per­son needs ap­pren­tice­ship in the first 10 or 15 years of their ca­reer,” he said. “And we know how to de­liver that in per­son. I’m not sure ap­pren­tice­ship hap­pens re­motely.”</p>
