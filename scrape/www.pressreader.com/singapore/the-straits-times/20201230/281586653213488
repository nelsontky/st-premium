    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub is con­fi­dent of stag­ing more and big­ger live events next year on the back of its suc­cess­ful host­ing of mul­ti­ple One Cham­pi­onship events since Oc­to­ber. Sports Hub chief ex­ec­u­tive Lionel Yeo said yes­ter­day that it has been a chal­leng­ing year but one of learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Sports Hub is con­fi­dent of stag­ing more and big­ger live events next year on the back of its suc­cess­ful host­ing of mul­ti­ple One Cham­pi­onship events since Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Its ex­pe­ri­ence of Pro­ject Dorm, which saw the OCBC Arena and Na­tional Sta­dium trans­formed to house 3,000 mi­grant work­ers to help con­tain the spread of Covid-19, has also show­cased its abil­ity to zone and ac­com­mo­date a size­able num­ber of peo­ple with­out com­pro­mis­ing on safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Sports Hub chief ex­ec­u­tive Lionel Yeo said yes­ter­day it has been a chal­leng­ing year but one of learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties as the $1.33 bil­lion fa­cil­ity is “ea­ger to put to­gether more safe and en­gag­ing events as we tran­si­tion into Phase 3”.</p>
    <p>He added: “With the right mind­set and ap­proach and the co­op­er­a­tion of all stake­hold­ers, we be­lieve that this na­tional as­set can de­liver great value to Sin­ga­pore through good times and bad.”</p>
    <p>Mixed mar­tial arts pro­mo­tion One Cham­pi­onship held a closed­door event on Oct 9 and another on Oct 30, which was the first live sports event here to wel­come spec­ta­tors. It had 250 fans in at­ten­dance.</p>
    <p>There have been four live shows in to­tal and they are part of a pilot pro­ject the Gov­ern­ment hopes will help iden­tify a model that can be widely im­ple­mented so that more large-scale events can re­sume safely in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>While there have been pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus cases in­volv­ing over­seas ath­letes and staff, these in­di­vid­u­als were iso­lated as part of strin­gent pro­to­cols which al­lowed the shows to pro­ceed as planned.</p>
    <p>With mar­quee events like rugby’s Sin­ga­pore Sevens and the In­ter­na­tional Cham­pi­ons Cup foot­ball com­pe­ti­tion can­celled, the Sports Hub moved into “phy­gi­tal” pro­grammes that carry both on­line and off­line el­e­ments.</p>
    <p>Last month, it hosted ZoomBa, a phy­gi­tal event that saw both on­line and off­line par­tic­i­pants come to­gether for Sin­ga­pore’s long­est</p>
    <p>Zumba re­lay.</p>
    <p>De­spite safe man­age­ment re­stric­tions, the Sports Hub wel­comed more than 4.8 mil­lion vis­i­tors this year and or­gan­ised more than 140 ac­tiv­ity ses­sions for Sin­ga­pore­ans in the last two months.</p>
    <p>The OCBC Aquatic Cen­tre was es­pe­cially pop­u­lar, with en­tries up 41 per cent in the fourth quar­ter of this year com­pared to the same pe­riod in 2019.</p>
