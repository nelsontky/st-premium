    <p>A to­tal of 90 staff and res­i­dents of a nurs­ing home were tested for Covid-19 af­ter a for­mer em­ployee who went back to the Philip­pines be­came in­fected.</p>
    <p>All the re­sults from those swabbed at the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home in Si­lat Av­enue came back neg­a­tive, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) last night.</p>
    <p>The MOH said it had been in­formed that a care staff who pre­vi­ously worked at the home had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Sun­day in the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Her last day at the nurs­ing home was last Wed­nes­day, and she had not dis­played any acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion symp­toms while she was at work.</p>
    <p>As a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, MOH and the Agency for In­te­grated Care (AIC) worked with the Lee Ah Mooi Home to test 90 staff and res­i­dents who were iden­ti­fied as pos­si­ble con­tacts of the case.</p>
    <p>All phys­i­cal vis­its to the nurs­ing home have also been sus­pended un­til fur­ther no­tice, said the AIC.</p>
    <p>The ward and af­fected ar­eas have been thor­oughly cleaned and dis­in­fected, and the staff’s use of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment will also be en­hanced.</p>
    <p>This was not the first in­fec­tion at the Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home.</p>
    <p>On March 31, the first coro­n­avirus case was con­firmed at its branch in Thom­son Lane. A to­tal of 16 staff and res­i­dents were sub­se­quently in­fected.</p>
    <p>There were 41 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,812.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded three community cases com­pris­ing one work pass holder and two work per­mit hold­ers, said MOH.</p>
    <p>There were also seven im­ported cases, com­pris­ing two Sin­ga­pore­ans, four per­ma­nent res­i­dents and a work per­mit holder.</p>
    <p>The six Sin­ga­pore­ans and PRs had re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from In­dia be­tween Aug 17 and Aug 19, and from Malaysia on Aug 17. The re­main­ing case is cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore and ar­rived from In­dia on Aug 19. All of them had been placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>No new lo­ca­tions or new clus­ters were added to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, MOH said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the community in a week has in­creased from two cases two weeks ago to three in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the community in a week has re­mained sta­ble, at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 72 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 55,643 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 78 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal while 1,049 are re­cu­per­at­ing in community fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
