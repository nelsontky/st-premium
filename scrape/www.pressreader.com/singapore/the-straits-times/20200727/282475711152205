    <p>TOKYO • Judo is known for its killer throws and light­ning-fast grap­pling moves, but the sport has a lesser­known ap­pli­ca­tion pop­u­lar in Ja­pan – the an­cient heal­ing art of “judo ther­apy”.</p>
    <p>Over its decades-long his­tory, judo has branched into two ar­eas. The “sappo” (kill method) de­vel­oped into the Olympic sport and the “kappo” (re­sus­ci­ta­tion method) grew into the art of “judo ther­apy”.</p>
    <p>Ju­dokas use their knowl­edge of how joints, limbs and mus­cles move to de­feat op­po­nents, but in “kappo”, ther­a­pists try to speed up the body’s nat­u­ral heal­ing mech­a­nism to treat in­juries that do not re­quire surgery or hospi­tal treatment.</p>
    <p>“Sim­ply put, we are spe­cial­ists in things such as bro­ken bones, dis­lo­ca­tions, bruises and sprains,” said Mr Hiroyuki Mit­suhashi, an ex­ec­u­tive at the Ja­pan Judo Ther­a­pist As­so­ci­a­tion. “Rather than per­form­ing surgery like in orthopaedi­cs, we use our hands to heal.”</p>
    <p>More than 73,000 li­censed judo ther­a­pists work at over 50,000 clin­ics across Ja­pan. They are es­pe­cially pop­u­lar with stu­dent ath­letes and those suf­fer­ing from the nag­ging pain of old in­juries that doc­tors would con­sider al­ready healed.</p>
    <p>Travel agent Yoshie Taka­hashi, 59, broke her right wrist in Jan­uary. She went to hospi­tal, but X-rays showed her treatment had failed to align the frac­ture prop­erly.</p>
    <p>She went to Mr Mit­suhashi, who used judo ther­apy tech­niques to ma­nip­u­late the joints and realign the bones cor­rectly.</p>
    <p>“I am much more com­fort­able here. I am feel­ing less pain,” Ms Taka­hashi said af­ter a visit to Mr Mit­suhashi’s clinic, where she re­ceived treat­ments in­clud­ing dip­ping her wrist in a tub of warm wa­ter with ul­tra­sound waves, a treatment said to ac­cel­er­ate heal­ing.</p>
    <p>“I think judo ther­a­pists are more pa­tient-fo­cused. They ex­plain things fully un­til you un­der­stand.”</p>
    <p>Apart from treat­ing in­juries, judo ther­a­pists are also help­ing to keep seniors fit and healthy in Ja­pan, where more than 28 per cent of peo­ple are aged 65 and older.</p>
    <p>Many judo ther­a­pists of­fer classes of low-im­pact judo-in­spired ex­er­cise that are keep­ing seniors sprightly and more re­sis­tant to falls.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing one such class ear­lier this year, judo ther­a­pist Taisuke Ka­suya put seniors through their paces at a Tokyo com­mu­nity cen­tre.</p>
    <p>For some three decades, Mr Ka­suya has taught mod­i­fied ver­sions of a low-in­ten­sity ex­er­cise with slow move­ments, us­ing a breath­ing tech­nique sim­i­lar to the Chi­nese prac­tice of taiji.</p>
    <p>But the orig­i­nal ex­er­cise was de­vised by Jig­oro Kano, the revered fa­ther of mod­ern judo.</p>
    <p>“Use your body ef­fi­ciently. That pro­motes your me­tab­o­lism and sta­bilises your men­tal state,” said Mr Ka­suya, who holds a black belt in judo, recit­ing Kano’s teach­ings.</p>
    <p>“We use the phi­los­o­phy of work­ing on both your body and your mind,” he added.</p>
    <p>The j udo-based ex­er­cise has eased chronic pain for sep­tu­a­ge­nar­ian Ya­sue Ikezumi, a re­tired phar­ma­cist who has taken Mr Ka­suya’s ex­er­cise class for 15 years.</p>
    <p>“This is dif­fer­ent from other ex­er­cises. I feel my joints are be­com­ing flex­i­ble,” she said. “I was in such pain in my 60s. But I am now al­most 80 and I am able to keep up my fit­ness. It’s like I am able to re­store my body.”</p>
    <p>Judo-based ex­er­cises can help im­prove the sense of bal­ance and pre­vent falls for many seniors, said Mr Koichi Hara­maki, a mar­tial artist who teaches judo in the western Wakayama re­gion.</p>
    <p>He holds a weekly class for seniors on how to fall.</p>
    <p>“The ul­ti­mate pur­pose is not for the el­derly to master the moves. But by rolling on mats and prac­tis­ing moves, they use their semi­cir­cu­lar canals (part of the in­ner ear that gov­erns bal­ance) and stim­u­late their cere­bel­lum,” he said.</p>
    <p>“If you prac­tise how to fall, in the end, you stop fall­ing. Your bal­ance im­proves.”</p>
