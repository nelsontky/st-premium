    <p>That kind of phi­los­o­phy is not the ap­proach that the Govern­ment is tak­ing, it doesn’t down­grade sports into a sec­tor where in tough times you cut first.</p>
    <p>Sip­ping on black cof­fee in his Hill Street of­fice, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong jokes about fi­nally be­ing able to see his of­fice car­pet af­ter spend­ing decades in a law firm packed from floor to ceil­ing with le­gal doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>But the chal­lenges fac­ing Sin­ga­pore sport are no laugh­ing mat­ter for the for­mer lawyer, who took over the min­istry in July dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>And even as Sin­ga­pore buck­les down in the face of eco­nomic un­cer­tainty, sport will not be put on the back burner, he in­sisted.</p>
    <p>When asked in an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view with The Straits Times on whether sport would see bud­get cuts, he said: “That kind of phi­los­o­phy is not the ap­proach that the Govern­ment is tak­ing, it doesn’t down­grade sports into a sec­tor where in tough times you cut first.</p>
    <p>“Of course, if bud­getary cuts are nec­es­sary across the board, then that’s un­avoid­able.”</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has taken a toll on busi­nesses here, and among the sports fra­ter­nity are fit­ness in­struc­tors, coaches, event or­gan­is­ers and venue op­er­a­tors who have been hit badly.</p>
    <p>The liveli­hoods of those in the com­mu­nity is a key pri­or­ity for Mr Tong, as his Min­istry has pumped in $50 mil­lion in re­lief mea­sures to help the sport sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“What re­mains the prin­ci­pal con­sid­er­a­tion is to en­sure that we can sup­port and tide over as many of th­ese play­ers in the sports ecosys­tem as pos­si­ble,” he said.</p>
    <p>Also un­af­fected is the $1.5 bil­lion set aside for the sports fa­cil­i­ties mas­ter plan, of which 30 to 40 per cent has been spent so far. Re­gional and town sports venues such as the Kal­lang Foot­ball Hub and Sin­ga­pore Ten­nis Cen­tre – both part of the Kal­lang Alive project – are sched­uled for com­ple­tion in 2021 and 2023 re­spec­tively. The highly an­tic­i­pated Pung­gol Re­gional Sports Cen­tre will also open in 2023.</p>

    <p>NOT BACK TO NOR­MAL YET</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is ex­pected to en­ter phase three of its re­open­ing at the end of the year with the eas­ing of some safety mea­sures, but week­end war­riors will have to wait longer to re­turn to the foot­ball pitch.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic sports fa­cil­i­ties re­opened on June 19 af­ter the cir­cuit breaker but safety guide­lines meant stricter con­tact lim­its for sports like rugby and mixed mar­tial arts, while team sports like bas­ket­ball and foot­ball had to fol­low the group-of-five rule.</p>
    <p>De­spite Covid-19 cases be­ing low in the com­mu­nity, con­cerns of a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tion mean that some team sports will likely re­turn only next year at the ear­li­est, said Mr Tong.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately it’s very dif­fi­cult to al­low a sce­nario for 11-a-side foot­ball, 22 peo­ple and prob­a­bly a bit more with the re­serves, run­ning around in close quar­ters with­out masks... with close con­tact that is un­avoid­able in phys­i­cal sports, it’s go­ing to be a chal­lenge.”</p>
    <p>An ex­cep­tion was made for the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL), which re­sumed on Oct 17 af­ter a seven-month hia­tus, with all lo­cal-based play­ers and match of­fi­cials un­der­go­ing swab tests.</p>
    <p>Fut­sal (five- or six-a-side) could be on the cards for phase three, but that would also be de­pen­dent on safety considerat­ions and med­i­cal ad­vice, he added.</p>
    <p>CLOSED-DOOR EVENTS OPEN­ING A CRACK</p>
    <p>Mixed mar­tial arts or­gan­i­sa­tion One Cham­pi­onship hosted its six­fight event at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium last night with 250 spec­ta­tors as part of a pi­lot project with the Govern­ment to help iden­tify a model that can be widely im­ple­mented for large-scale events to re­sume safely here.</p>
    <p>The fans were re­quired to un­dergo an Anti­gen Rapid Test (ART) at a des­ig­nated clinic on the day of the fight and pro­duce a valid neg­a­tive ART cer­tifi­cate be­fore they were al­lowed into the venue.</p>
    <p>Foot­ball en­thu­si­asts could also wel­come good news, as Mr Tong said a lim­ited num­ber of spec­ta­tors could be al­lowed into sta­di­ums for SPL games. But he did not give a time­line for this.</p>
    <p>When queried, Sport Sin­ga­pore would only say: “The au­thor­i­ties are tak­ing a pro­gres­sive ap­proach in restart­ing other sport com­pe­ti­tions and open­ing up th­ese com­pe­ti­tions for spec­ta­tors.</p>
    <p>“We must en­sure that the nec­es­sary safe man­age­ment mea­sures and pro­to­cols are im­ple­mented and fol­lowed strictly to min­imise Covid-19 trans­mis­sion risk.”</p>
    <p>HOW TO STOP IN­FIGHT­ING AT NSAs</p>
    <p>Out­side of the Covid-19 re­lated chal­lenges, some sports such as ath­let­ics and taek­wondo have been plagued by in­fight­ing and dis­putes, which have re­sulted in much-pub­li­cised law­suits fly­ing be­tween ath­letes, of­fi­cials and the as­so­ci­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Weigh­ing in on the mat­ter, Mr Tong said: “They (vol­un­teers in each NSA) are all pas­sion­ate peo­ple about their chosen sport... There are dif­fer­ences in opin­ions, dif­fer­ences in ap­proach and strat­egy, some­times per­son­al­ity clashes too, be­cause they care for what they be­lieve in.</p>
    <p>“I’m not re­ally sur­prised to see this oc­ca­sion­ally boil over. But we have to also try and har­ness this en­ergy in a pos­i­tive way.”</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties could look into shared ser­vices for the NSAs in ar­eas such as ad­min­is­tra­tion, fi­nance and gov­er­nance, which would “free up NSAs to fo­cus on their sport” and “re­duce some av­enue for dis­agree­ment”, added Mr Tong.</p>
