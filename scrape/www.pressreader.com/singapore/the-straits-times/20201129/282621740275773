    <p>The pour among the rich is dif­fer­ent from you and me – only they can af­ford grand cru bur­gundy.</p>
    <p>That wasn’t al­ways the case. In the 1990s, mid­dle-class wine lovers could still af­ford to ex­pe­ri­ence that rite of pas­sage – drinking a truly great wine, not sim­ply to en­joy it but also to un­der­stand what qual­i­ties made it ex­cep­tional in the eyes of his­tory.</p>
    <p>It was still fea­si­ble then, just as it was pos­si­ble to buy first-growth Bordeaux, or the top wines of Barolo, Brunello di Mon­tal­cino or Napa Val­ley Caber­net Sauvi­gnon, to name a few other stan­dard-bear­ers. For ex­am­ple, back in 1994, a bot­tle of Comte Ge­orges de Vogue Musigny 1991, a grand cru, re­tailed for US$80. Today, that bot­tle costs about US$800 (S$1,100).</p>
    <p>In a more ex­treme case, Do­maine de la Ro­ma­nee-Conti La Tache 1990, an­other grand cru and one of the world’s great wines, cost US$285 in 1993. Today, a bot­tle of the 2017 La Tache goes for about US$5,000, well out of reach for ded­i­cated stu­dents of wine, ex­cept for the most wealthy.</p>
    <p>For wine lovers, drinking such renowned bot­tles would be the equiv­a­lent of a col­lege course in Shake­speare, Beethoven or Char­lie Parker. In any field, it’s nec­es­sary to com­pre­hend the ref­er­ence points, the bench­marks that con­note greatness, to join that con­ver­sa­tion even if ul­ti­mately you choose to ar­gue the point.</p>
    <p>Th­ese days, it is im­pos­si­ble for most peo­ple to pay for th­ese wines.</p>
    <p>You could ar­gue that prices have risen on all sorts of con­sumer goods since then. Why should wine be dif­fer­ent? You would not be wrong.</p>
    <p>But the is­sue is not sim­ply that prices in gen­eral have gone up. The prices of top wines have risen at a far steeper rate than the prices of many other lux­ury goods.</p>
    <p>La Tache 2017 is al­most 18 times as ex­pen­sive as the 1990 vin­tage, while the price of a ba­sic Her­mes Birkin 30 bag, the grand cru of hand­bags, has gone from about US$3,000 in 1990 to US$11,000 this year, not quite four times as much.</p>
    <p>Bordeaux op­er­ates on a slightly dif­fer­ent scale from bur­gundy. Far more wine is pro­duced.</p>
    <p>But it, too, has its bench­mark wines and, like bur­gundy, its prices have sky­rock­eted.</p>
    <p>Prince­ton Univer­sity’s eco­nomics pro­fes­sor Or­ley Ashen­fel­ter has closely tracked the Bordeaux mar­ket for years. In 1980, the price of a first-growth Bordeaux was roughly four times the price of a fifth-growth Bordeaux, he said, re­fer­ring to an 1855 clas­si­fi­ca­tion that ranked top Me­doc pro­duc­ers in five tiers, or growths.</p>
    <p>Now, he said, as prices have risen for all of th­ese top wines, the ra­tio be­tween first- and fifth-growth price is more like 10-to-1.</p>
    <p>Partly, it’s the good old law of sup­ply and de­mand. Great wine is tied to fi­nite pieces of land and to the rhythms of agri­cul­ture. With a limited quan­tity of grapes and only one op­por­tu­nity to make wine each year, pro­duc­tion can­not be in­creased to meet ris­ing de­mand.</p>
    <p>With the ex­cep­tion of cer­tain top cham­pagnes like Dom Perignon, which are not linked to par­tic­u­lar vine­yards, the best wines are not lux­ury goods such as watches or hand­bags in which pro­duc­tion can grow to meet de­mand. Nei­ther can pro­duc­tion be kept ar­ti­fi­cially low, for that mat­ter, to cre­ate de­mand.</p>
    <p>Yet, even for a tro­phy wine like Dom Perignon, the rel­a­tive price has gone up. A study pub­lished in 2017 in The Jour­nal Of Wine Eco­nomics an­a­lysed cham­pagne prices in New York City from 1948 to 2013 by de­ter­min­ing how many hours peo­ple in var­i­ous in­come groups would have to work to pay for an en­try-level cham­pagne, a mid-range bot­tle and a flag­ship or lux­ury cu­vee like Dom Perignon.</p>
    <p>The study found that the en­trylevel bot­tles across in­come groups re­quired fewer work hours in 2013 than in 1948, but the hours nec­es­sary to buy lux­ury bot­tles had in­creased. What’s more, the study found that the work hours re­quired for a top cham­pagne in­creased at a much higher rate for the lower-in­come groups rel­a­tive to the high­est, mean­ing that their ac­cess had di­min­ished.</p>
    <p>Today, wine lovers from around the world clam­our for roughly the same pool of great bur­gundies that was avail­able in 1990.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, great wines are be­ing pro­duced all over the world nowa­days. Those who are fas­ci­nated by how wine can ex­press in in­tri­cate de­tail the char­ac­ter­is­tics of a place and cul­ture can turn to Ger­man Ries­lings, the Chenin Blancs of Saven­nieres, Chi­anti Clas­si­cos and Pri­o­rats.</p>
    <p>They also have many other less ex­pen­sive op­tions, in places such as Bur­gundy and Bordeaux, wines that are highly plea­sur­able and of­fer a taste of what the fuss is about, even if they don’t tell the full story.</p>
