    <p>LONDON • A lack­lus­tre draw for Europe’s 2022 World Cup qual­i­fiers could once again raise the ques­tion over the for­mat used by Uefa, which some feel makes it too easy for the top teams while fea­tur­ing too many mis­matches.</p>
    <p>Although Mon­day’s draw in Zurich pro­duced some in­ter­est­ing fix­tures from a his­tor­i­cal per­spec­tive – Eng­land against Poland and Hun­gary – there were no heavy­weight clashes to get pulses rac­ing.</p>
    <p>This was by de­sign rather than ac­ci­dent as the big­gest teams were kept apart by the seed­ing sys­tem, leav­ing all of them with rel­a­tively straight­for­ward routes to Qatar.</p>
    <p>Even if the likes of Spain, Italy, France, Por­tu­gal, Ger­many, the Nether­lands, Bel­gium and Eng­land fail to win their groups, they get a sec­ond bite of the cherry through the play-offs.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Euro­pean sys­tem, the con­ti­nent’s 55 teams are di­vided into 10 groups of five or six, which in Mon­day’s case pro­duced fix­tures such as Ger­many v Liecht­en­stein, Eng­land v San Marino and the Nether­lands v Gi­bral­tar.</p>
    <p>This, in turn, leads to the idea in Europe that the in­ter­na­tional break is “bor­ing” and pro­vides an un­wel­come in­ter­lude to the club sea­son.</p>
    <p>Eng­land’s progress to the last World Cup was so serene that, when they beat Slove­nia 1-0 to guar­an­tee their place at Rus­sia 2018, bored fans were throw­ing pa­per planes onto the pitch in­stead of cel­e­brat­ing.</p>
    <p>Yet in other parts of the world, the in­ter­na­tional break is the year’s high­light, no more so than in South Amer­ica which has the ideal for­mat for its re­gion.</p>
    <p>With only 10 teams and no real min­nows, the con­ti­nent uses the sim­plest and fairest sys­tem pos­si­ble – a sin­gle group where ev­ery team play each other twice.</p>
    <p>The for­mat rou­tinely serves up drama and con­tro­versy in equal mea­sures and has also al­lowed lesser teams like Venezuela and Ecuador to im­prove enor­mously, thanks to greater ex­po­sure to com­pet­i­tive matches.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Africa, Asia and the Con­ca­caf re­gion all use a staged for­mat, in which the lower-ranked teams take part in pre­lim­i­nary rounds and the big­ger teams en­ter the fray at a later stage.</p>
    <p>Europe has so far re­sisted this route, with Uefa ar­gu­ing that the small­est na­tions have the right to face the big­gest in qual­i­fy­ing.</p>
    <p>But with World Cups con­tin­u­ing to ex­pand – the 2026 edi­tion that will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mex­ico will fea­ture 48 teams, up from 32 – this tra­di­tional group sys­tem will only be­come even less com­pet­i­tive.</p>
