    <p>Ef­forts to en­cour­age com­pa­nies to ad­dress the men­tal health concerns of their em­ploy­ees are an im­por­tant as­pect of deal­ing with the ef­fects of the coro­n­avirus pandemic. Work­ing from home while tak­ing care of other re­spon­si­bil­i­ties there in­creases stress. The fear of ad­verse change, in­clud­ing concerns about the pos­si­bil­ity of re­trench­ment, adds to anx­i­eties. Even re­turn­ing to of­fice af­ter hav­ing worked from home for some time en­tails its own set of pres­sures on men­tal health. Firms need to fol­low up on rec­om­mended prac­tices and come up with some of their own mea­sures be­cause only a men­tally ca­pa­ble work­force will be a pro­duc­tive one. Men­tal health was a press­ing con­cern even be­fore Covid-19’s on­set.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Men­tal Health Study con­ducted be­tween 2016 and 2018 found that one in seven peo­ple ex­pe­ri­enced a men­tal dis­or­der in his life­time, com­pared with one in eight in the 2010 Men­tal Health Study. In­ter­na­tional stud­ies have cited stress at work as be­ing among fac­tors associated with poor men­tal health. For ex­am­ple, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) says that while work is good for men­tal health, a neg­a­tive work­ing en­vi­ron­ment can lead to phys­i­cal and men­tal health prob­lems. Glob­ally, the WHO notes, an es­ti­mated 264 mil­lion peo­ple suf­fer from de­pres­sion, one of the lead­ing causes of dis­abil­ity, with many of them also suf­fer­ing from symp­toms of anx­i­ety. De­pres­sion and anx­i­ety have a sig­nif­i­cant eco­nomic im­pact, the WHO adds, be­cause the es­ti­mated cost to the global econ­omy is US$1 tril­lion (S$1.3 tril­lion) an­nu­ally in lost pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore could avoid the pit­falls of work-re­lated men­tal health prob­lems, ex­ac­er­bated by Covid-19, were com­pa­nies and workers them­selves to take the rec­om­men­da­tions of this week’s tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory se­ri­ously. One im­por­tant rec­om­men­da­tion calls for the estab­lish­ment of a work-life har­mony pol­icy to pro­vide clar­ity on af­ter-hours work com­mu­ni­ca­tion. Em­ploy­ers should set out the clear po­si­tion that, for work-re­lated mes­sages and e-mail sent af­ter work hours, a re­sponse is not ex­pected un­til the next work­ing day, ex­cept for mes­sages or e-mail marked as ur­gent. Un­der­stand­ing the need for ad­e­quate rest out­side of work hours will help re­duce burnout from work and en­hance pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>How­ever, em­ploy­ees, too, should be alert to men­tal health prob­lems and seek help be­fore they worsen. In that re­gard, firms should re­view the state of workers’ men­tal well-be­ing reg­u­larly as part of their risk as­sess­ment for work­place health. It would be a pity if com­pa­nies were to ig­nore the fun­da­men­tals of their suc­cess in the rush to make up for lost time fol­low­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. On the con­trary, tak­ing the longer view of pro­duc­tiv­ity would mean car­ing for the men­tal well-be­ing of em­ploy­ees here and now be­cause the ef­fects of Covid-19 will last.</p>
