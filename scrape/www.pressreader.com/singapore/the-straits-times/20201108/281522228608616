    <p>DG Ca­role Ann grooms An­gel, her six-year-old shih tzu, ev­ery day, brush­ing the dog’s coat with a comb and clean­ing her eyes with wet cot­ton pads. “I also clean her ears with a cot­ton swab. It’s dan­ger­ous, but I have learnt the tech­nique. She trusts me and she doesn’t move,” says the 43-year-old.</p>
    <p>She’s not over­stat­ing the dif­fi­culty of the task. Ms Ca­role, you see, moves around in a wheel­chair. Her limbs have been am­pu­tated: her hands, just after the wrists, and her legs, be­low the knees.</p>
    <p>Clean­ing An­gel’s ears in­volves hold­ing the cot­ton stick by press­ing it be­tween the stumps of her arms and guid­ing it care­fully into her pet’s ear canals.</p>
    <p>Life wasn’t al­ways like this. Up un­til Septem­ber two years ago, Ms Ca­role was an able-bod­ied woman liv­ing a reg­u­lar life.</p>
    <p>But that changed when a cyst in one of her ovaries rup­tured, caus­ing the for­mer process qual­ity ex­ec­u­tive to go into sep­tic shock. She was in an in­duced coma for two months, dur­ing which time her lungs col­lapsed, her kid­neys stopped work­ing and her heart stopped at least twice.</p>
    <p>Ms Ca­role – who was in­tu­bated and spent more than four months in the in­ten­sive care unit – was given in­otropes, a class of drugs used to treat pa­tients with acute heart fail­ure or sep­tic shock. They saved her life but also turned her limbs gan­grenous.</p>
    <p>She re­sisted am­pu­ta­tion for as long as she could, but fi­nally had parts of all four limbs sev­ered in Au­gust last year.</p>
    <p>“So I asked God: ‘Re­ally? No hand, no fin­ger? Not even one? That’s the best you could do?’” she jokes be­fore bursting into a fit of gig­gles.</p>
    <p>Be­fore that ovar­ian cyst up­ended her world, she was not, she says, liv­ing her life well.</p>
    <p>“I iso­lated my­self for a cou­ple of years be­cause I got sucked into de­pres­sion, think­ing about my fail­ures. Maybe it was God giv­ing me a kick in the butt.”</p>
    <p>She is the sec­ond of two chil­dren. Her father, a se­cu­rity of­fi­cer, died when she was three years old. A fam­ily friend of­fered them a roof over their heads, and also helped to raise Ms Ca­role and her younger brother un­til she was about 13.</p>
    <p>After that, her fam­ily moved out to a rental flat and her mother took on two jobs to make ends meet.</p>
    <p>“We moved from rental flat to rental flat un­til my mother bought this with her blood-and-sweat money about 20 years ago,” she</p>
    <p>says, look­ing around the spick-and-span four-room unit in Sengkang.</p>
    <p>Ms Ca­role com­pleted her se­condary ed­u­ca­tion at the then St An­thony’s Con­vent and, by her own ad­mis­sion, was a re­bel­lious teen – “you know, smok­ing, boyfriends, stay­ing out late”.</p>
    <p>Her O-level re­sults were not good enough to get her into a polytech­nic to study nurs­ing, so she set­tled for ac­count­ing at the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion in Bis­han in­stead.</p>
    <p>“I hated it,” she says, adding that she showed her dis­dain by skip­ping classes and drop­ping out after one year.</p>
    <p>She then signed up with the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces as a non-uni­formed em­ployee and cut her teeth pro­fes­sion­ally as a chief clerk at Sele­tar Air Base.</p>
    <p>“Lots of hand­some pilots and good-look­ing ma­jors and cap­tains,” she re­calls, laugh­ing.</p>
    <p>She left after three years and had a stint as an ad­min­is­tra­tive as­sis­tant in a le­gal firm be­fore land­ing a cus­tomer ser­vice job at in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy com­pany Com­paq in 2003.</p>
    <p>The job suited her, and over the next decade, she rose through the ranks, even­tu­ally tak­ing on su­per­vi­sory and man­age­rial roles in cus­tomer ser­vice and ser­vice qual­ity at tech com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing Hewlett-Packard.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t al­ways smooth sail­ing. She went through a re­trench­ment – al­though she used the size­able pack­age to help pay for a two-room Hous­ing Board unit for sin­gles in River­vale Cres­cent – and ex­pe­ri­enced of­fice pol­i­tics, which led to a brush with the blues that lasted for nearly a year.</p>
    <p>Just when her life was set­tling on an even keel after she joined Sing­tel in 2016 as a qual­ity process ex­ec­u­tive, she was hit by a bolt from the blue.</p>
    <p>As dawn was break­ing on Sept 4 in 2018, a sear­ing pain in her womb jolted her from slum­ber. She thought it was a nor­mal stom­ach cramp brought on by stress, weight gain and a failed re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, she called her mother, who had re­turned to Sin­ga­pore the night be­fore, after at­tend­ing a wed­ding in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>“My aunt and cousin who were vis­it­ing from Lon­don were stay­ing with her and they were all very tired. My mum said she would come to my flat with my aunt later,” she re­calls.</p>
    <p>When the duo didn’t turn up by 9am, she called for an am­bu­lance her­self be­cause she was in such agony. She ended up in the emer­gency depart­ment of Khoo Teck Puat Hospi­tal (KTPH). She is not too sure what tran­spired that day. She just knew doc­tors mon­i­tored her and or­dered a bat­tery of tests be­fore she “crashed”.</p>
    <p>“I woke up two months later. My hands and legs were ban­daged, I couldn’t move, I was in di­a­pers, I had bed­sores on my body, I had a hole in my stom­ach and a skin graft over it. And I was in­tu­bated and couldn’t speak,” she re­calls.</p>
    <p>A rup­tured ovar­ian cyst had led to sep­sis, a life-threat­en­ing con­di­tion when the body’s re­sponse to in­fec­tion causes in­jury to its own tis­sues and or­gans.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors ini­tially tried key­hole surgery to drain the pus from her body, but when that didn’t work, they “lit­er­ally cut a hole in my stom­ach and put a vac­uum there”.</p>
    <p>That gap­ing hole – slightly smaller than a food tray – gave her mul­ti­ple prob­lems: It would not heal for the long­est time, and for sev­eral months, her in­testines were hang­ing out­side that cav­ity.</p>
    <p>“You want to see? I have pic­tures,” she of­fers.</p>
    <p>She is not sure how many op­er­a­tions or pro­ce­dures she had while she was un­con­scious; she only knows she went to hell and back, sev­eral times.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors pre­pared her mother and brother for the worst on a cou­ple of oc­ca­sions – once, when they found a big blood clot in her lungs.</p>
    <p>“I’ve had two last rites be­cause the priest was called,” she says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>Two of her aunts even went to look for fu­neral at­tire for her and set­tled on a white blouse from Dorothy Perkins, at the re­quest of her mother, Madam San­dra Ku­mari.</p>
    <p>The 69-year-old part-time se­cu­rity screener says: “I don’t know why, but while wait­ing out­side the op­er­at­ing theatre one day, I said: ‘If any­thing hap­pens to her, I want her to go in white.’” Why white?</p>
    <p>“Be­cause she was wear­ing black all her life. She al­ways wears black.”</p>
    <p>Asked if she was in pain then, Ms Ca­role shakes her head. She had many hal­lu­ci­na­tions and dreams, though.</p>
    <p>“You know what made me come back? I saw my mother in the hospi­tal; she was stand­ing in the cor­ner of the room. So I said to her: ‘Come closer lah, why are you stand­ing there and look­ing so wor­ried?’</p>
    <p>“And then she said to me: ‘If you want to go, you can go. It’s okay,</p>
    <p>I’m fine.’ And she was cry­ing, you know. And I re­mem­ber say­ing: ‘Huh? Go where? I’m not go­ing any­where.’ And then I woke up.”</p>
    <p>Tear­ing up, Madam San­dra says: “I was think­ing maybe she’s wor­ried about me. You know, some­times they hang on, you know. So I told her, don’t worry about it, if you have to go, you go, okay? Don’t worry about me, okay? We will be sad, but...”</p>
    <p>Ms Ca­role – whose faith has be­come stronger over the last two years – shakes her head when asked if she felt bit­ter and re­sent­ful over what hap­pened to her.</p>
    <p>“I woke up free. I was, of course, still on drugs, but when I looked at my hands and legs, I never grieved. It was al­most like I was pre­pared for what had hap­pened.”</p>
    <p>The peo­ple around her were filled with un­cer­tainty, she says, fret­ting over how she would cope. “But I was calm as a cu­cum­ber.” She shifts in her wheel­chair, un­sure if she should ver­balise what she wants to say.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple said it was fate, and I told my­self: Yes, maybe it’s a fate that only I’m pre­des­tined to live be­cause of my na­ture and my char­ac­ter... be­cause I can take it. I’m not some­body who will just lie down and cry,” she says.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors, fear­ful that the in­fec­tion could spread and prove fa­tal, ad­vised her to am­pu­tate her gan­grenous limbs as quickly as pos­si­ble, but she de­cided she needed time.</p>
    <p>It worked in her favour. Against all odds, parts of her arms started heal­ing, and the even­tual am­pu­ta­tions – more than a year after she was dis­charged – were not as se­vere as they would have been.</p>
    <p>“It also gave me time to get hold of my emo­tions and talk to my limbs. I told them to go off to heaven, and said: ‘You can­not dis­turb me when you go, I will meet you again when I die,’” says Ms Ca­role, who has been fit­ted with pros­thetic legs and is now un­der­go­ing ex­ten­sive phys­io­ther­apy to learn how to walk in them.</p>
    <p>Per­haps that’s why, she be­lieves, she has not ex­pe­ri­enced phan­tom limb syn­drome, the abil­ity to feel sensations and even pain in a limb or limbs that no longer ex­ist.</p>
    <p>Be­sides KTPH, sev­eral hos­pi­tals were in­volved in treat­ing her over the last two years, in­clud­ing Yishun Com­mu­nity and Tan Tock Seng. She cur­rently un­der­goes phys­io­ther­apy at St Luke’s</p>
    <p>Hospi­tal ev­ery Tues­day.</p>
    <p>In­stead of mop­ing, the feisty woman, who has been liv­ing with her mother since her dis­charge, is fo­cused on liv­ing life as nor­mally as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>A big fan of crime dra­mas and dog-groom­ing YouTube videos, she has learnt to trans­fer her­self to and from her wheel­chair and her bed. She eats with a spoon and other uten­sils fixed to a vel­cro strap she wraps around the end of her right arm, and also has an “easy holder” to help her grip pens and her sty­lus to in­ter­face with her com­puter and mo­bile de­vices.</p>
    <p>“Google Home helps me with lights, music and re­minders,” says Ms Ca­role, whose com­puter is also fit­ted with a gi­ant key­board that al­lows her to type, and with speech recog­ni­tion tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>She even has a mouse track­ball – spe­cially de­vel­oped for her by the en­gi­neer­ing folks from non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion En­gi­neer­ing Good in a project or­gan­ised by SG En­able, the agency for help­ing peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“But there are still many things I can­not do, and I can’t thank my mother enough for how she looks after me. And my brother too,” she says.</p>
    <p>Her will to live well is driven in part by friends and fam­ily who have ral­lied around her and prayed for her; her for­mer col­leagues even raised funds to have her toi­let ren­o­vated to meet her needs.</p>
    <p>In the last month, she has had in­ter­views with two or­gan­i­sa­tions and is hop­ing that she will land a full-time job soon.</p>
    <p>She doesn’t waste time be­moan­ing her fate.</p>
    <p>“If you think too much about why you’re suf­fer­ing, you will never live.”</p>
    <p>BACK TO CON­SCIOUS­NESS</p>
    <p>You know what made me come back? I saw my mother in the hospi­tal; she was stand­ing in the cor­ner of the room. So I said to her: ‘Come closer lah, why are you stand­ing there and look­ing so wor­ried?’ And then she said to me: ‘If you want to go, you can go. It’s okay, I’m fine.’ And she was cry­ing, you know. And I re­mem­ber say­ing: ‘Huh? Go where? I’m not go­ing any­where.’ And then I woke up.</p>
