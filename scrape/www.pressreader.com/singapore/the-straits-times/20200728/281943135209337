    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain has pro­posed strict new lim­its on junk food ad­ver­tis­ing as min­is­ters seek to con­trol the coun­try’s grow­ing obe­sity prob­lem, which has been iden­ti­fied as a fac­tor in coro­n­avirus deaths.</p>
    <p>The plans in­clude ban­ning TV and on­line ad­ver­tis­ing of foods high in fat, su­gar or salt be­fore 9pm, the Depart­ment for Health and So­cial Care said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Los­ing weight is hard, but with some small changes, we can all feel fit­ter and health­ier,” Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“If we all do our bit, we can re­duce our health risks.”</p>
    <p>The curbs mark a change of tack for Mr John­son, who has pre­vi­ously com­plained about “nanny state” med­dling in the lives of or­di­nary peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic and his own hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion i n April per­suaded him of the need to act on obe­sity. In a Twit­ter video yes­ter­day, Mr John­son said he had strug­gled with weight is­sues.</p>
    <p>Al­most two-thirds of Bri­tish adults are over­weight, and one in three chil­dren leaves pri­mary school weigh­ing too much, said the Health Depart­ment. Be­ing too heavy also puts peo­ple at greater risk of be­ing in­fected by the coro­n­avirus and places ad­di­tional strain on the Na­tional Health Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment will also end buy-one-get-one-free pro­mo­tions on sug­ary foods and re­quire calo­rie la­bels on more prod­ucts in stores as well as in restau­rants. It is start­ing a con­sul­ta­tion on putting calo­rie counts on al­co­holic bev­er­ages.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions will pile more pres­sure on food, re­tail, ad­ver­tis­ing and me­dia in­dus­tries al­ready suf­fer­ing from the eco­nomic lock­down im­posed to con­trol the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with thou­sands of jobs un­der threat.</p>
    <p>The Food and Drink Fed­er­a­tion has slammed the pro­pos­als, say­ing they will have a neg­li­gi­ble ef­fect on re­duc­ing calo­rie con­sump­tion while push­ing up prices for con­sumers and threat­en­ing jobs. It said the mea­sures could add £600 (S$1,065) a year to the cost of a typ­i­cal fam­ily’s gro­cery shop­ping bill.</p>
