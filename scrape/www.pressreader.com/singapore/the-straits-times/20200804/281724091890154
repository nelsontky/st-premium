    <p>HANOI • Viet­nam is in the midst of a “de­ci­sive” fight against the coro­n­avirus, its Prime Min­is­ter has said, fo­cus­ing on the city of Danang where in­fec­tions have ap­peared in four fac­to­ries with a com­bined work­force of 3,700.</p>
    <p>“We have to de­ploy full force to curb all known epi­cen­tres, es­pe­cially those in Danang,” of­fi­cial broad­caster Viet­nam Tele­vi­sion quoted Prime Min­is­ter Nguyen Xuan Phuc yes­ter­day as telling gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials. “Early Au­gust will be the de­ci­sive time within which to stop the virus from spread­ing on a large scale.”</p>
    <p>Viet­nam does not plan to in­tro­duce a wide­spread lock­down be­yond ar­eas con­sid­ered to be epi­cen­tres of the cur­rent outbreak, a gov­ern­ment spokesman said yes­ter­day. “If there is an in­fec­tion in a ham­let, we will lock down that ham­let only, not the whole district or the whole prov­ince,” gov­ern­ment spokesman Mai Tien Dung told a monthly news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam, widely praised for its mit­i­ga­tion ef­forts since the coro­n­avirus ap­peared in late Jan­uary, is bat­tling sev­eral new clus­ters of in­fec­tion linked to Danang, af­ter go­ing more than three months with­out detecting any do­mes­tic trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The coun­try of 96 mil­lion has con­firmed at least 642 Covid-19 in­fec­tions, with six deaths.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day re­ported 22 new cases linked to Danang, in cen­tral Viet­nam and a tourism hot spot, where the coun­try’s first do­mes­ti­cally trans­mit­ted case in 100 days was con­firmed on July 25.</p>
    <p>The source of the new outbreak is un­clear, but it has spread to at least 10 places, in­clud­ing the cap­i­tal Hanoi in the north and the busi­ness hub of Ho Chi Minh City in the south, in­fect­ing al­most 200 peo­ple and killing six.</p>
    <p>Four cases were found at fac­to­ries in dif­fer­ent in­dus­trial parks in Danang that col­lec­tively em­ploy 77,000 peo­ple, the Lao Dong news­pa­per said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment said last Satur­day that it planned to test Danang’s en­tire pop­u­la­tion of 1.1 mil­lion peo­ple, part of “un­prece­dented mea­sures” to fight the outbreak. Danang im­posed a lock­down last week, ban­ning move­ment in and out of the coastal city and clos­ing en­ter­tain­ment venues.</p>
    <p>Buon Ma Thuot, a city in Viet­nam’s cof­fee-grow­ing Cen­tral High­lands re­gion, was also placed un­der lock­down yes­ter­day, state me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>Of the lat­est in­fec­tions, 23 per cent are asymp­to­matic, the gov­ern­ment said, mean­ing peo­ple in­fected with the virus do not show symp­toms of the Covid-19 res­pi­ra­tory sick­ness it causes.</p>
    <p>Mr Phuc said the new outbreak could have a more crit­i­cal im­pact than pre­vi­ous waves of in­fec­tion. The au­thor­i­ties said on Sun­day that the strain of virus de­tected in Danang was a more con­ta­gious one, and that each in­fected per­son could in­fect five to six peo­ple, com­pared with 1.8 to 2.2 for in­fec­tions ear­lier in the year.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam has car­ried out 52,000 tests for Covid-19 in the past seven days, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters anal­y­sis of of­fi­cial data. Health Min­istry data does not in­clude rapid tests used for mass screen­ing.</p>
