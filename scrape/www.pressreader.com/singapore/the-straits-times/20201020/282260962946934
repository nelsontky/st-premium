    <p>WELLING­TON • Caleb Clarke made a big im­pres­sion on his first Test start for the All Blacks on Sun­day but if his sea­son had gone to plan, the left-winger would not have rolled off New Zealand’s pro­duc­tion line of back­line tal­ent at all this year.</p>
    <p>In­stead of bust­ing through Wal­la­bies tack­lers in Bledis­loe Cup Tests, the 21-year-old was sup­posed to have spent his time on the in­ter­na­tional rugby sev­ens cir­cuit prepar­ing for a shot at gold at the Tokyo Olympics.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic, how­ever, forced the can­cel­la­tion of the cir­cuit and then the post­pone­ment of the 2020 Games to next July.</p>
    <p>Back with the Auck­land Blues full-time, Clarke was one of the stand­out per­form­ers in the do­mes­tic Su­per Rugby com­pe­ti­tion and it was lit­tle sur­prise that he fol­lowed his fa­ther Eroni into the All Blacks.</p>
    <p>They be­came the 20th fa­ther-and-son All Blacks pair­ing when he came off the bench for an im­pres­sive 11-minute cameo in the first Bledis­loe Cup match last week in Welling­ton.</p>
    <p>A less-than-con­vinc­ing out­ing by Ian Foster’s team in that game, cou­pled with an in­jury to Ge­orge Bridge, pro­pelled Clarke into the start­ing line-up for the se­cond Test on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He was the cat­a­lyst of an im­proved All Blacks’ at­tack, with his pow­er­ful run­ning set­ting up two se­cond-half tries in a 27-7 win and earn­ing com­par­isons with the late Jonah Lomu.</p>
    <p>“I grew up watch­ing that jer­sey all my life,” Clarke yes­ter­day said of Lomu’s No. 11. “It was re­ally spe­cial to chuck it on for the first time and let it sink in.</p>
    <p>“I did my pregame a bit faster be­cause I just wanted to sit and have a mo­ment in the jer­sey for a lit­tle bit.”</p>
    <p>Clarke is just the lat­est All Blacks power winger to ter­rorise de­fences with power and speed – Joe Roko­coko, Ju­lian Savea and Rieko Ioane have all sparkled in the jer­sey over the last 20 years.</p>
    <p>He was just as pun­ish­ing as his pre­de­ces­sors on Sun­day, pow­er­ing through would-be tack­lers and us­ing the speed that saw him run the 100m in 10.72 sec­onds when in sec­ondary school to leave oth­ers grasp­ing at thin air.</p>
    <p>Foster has called for calm over his per­for­mance but was happy with how Clarke, shown on so­cial me­dia to be a handy pi­anist, was keep­ing a level head.</p>
    <p>“What the world wants to say, that’s their busi­ness,” he said yes­ter­day. “I’m re­ally con­fi­dent that he’s grounded. He’s got a lot of self-be­lief and self-aware­ness in him­self.</p>
    <p>“You’ve just got to en­joy what you do and keep grow­ing.”</p>
    <p>Caleb Clarke was a bat­ter­ing ram for the All Blacks in their se­cond Test win over Aus­tralia on Sun­day.</p>
