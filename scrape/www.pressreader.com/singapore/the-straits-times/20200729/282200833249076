    <p>LON­DON • Lando Nor­ris has en­joyed teas­ing his McLaren team mate Car­los Sainz about how the Fer­rari-bound Spa­niard could be join­ing a slower team next sea­son, but the Bri­ton is also se­ri­ous.</p>
    <p>Nor­ris be­lieves McLaren have a real chance of fin­ish­ing ahead of Fer­rari in the Formula One con­struc­tors’ cham­pi­onship this sea­son. McLaren are third over­all af­ter three races while Fer­rari, last year’s run­ners-up, are fifth.</p>
    <p>“We have an op­por­tu­nity to beat Fer­rari. We have an op­por­tu­nity to fight them through­out the sea­son,” Nor­ris said ahead of Sun­day’s Bri­tish Grand Prix at Sil­ver­stone.</p>
    <p>“I think it would mean a lot to us as a team to take the next step and beat a team that’s been front-run­ning for a few years, for many years, to show the progress we have made.</p>
    <p>“It would give us a bit more of that drive to con­tinue on and beat them into the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>McLaren are the sport’s sec­ond most suc­cess­ful team in terms of wins (182) and ti­tles (eight con­struc­tors’ and 12 driv­ers’ cham­pi­onships) af­ter Fer­rari, who have 16 con­struc­tors’ and 15 driv­ers’ cham­pi­onships.</p>
    <p>But the Wok­ing-based out­fit have not won a race since 2012.</p>
    <p>They are back on the as­cen­dancy, how­ever, with Nor­ris fourth over­all af­ter three races and tak­ing his first F1 podium in Aus­tria.</p>
    <p>“We still have our up­grade to come. Fer­rari seem to be in a dif­fi­cult position at the mo­ment with what they are try­ing to do and achieve,” the 20-year-old added.</p>
    <p>“They had their big up­grades, or a lot of them, for Bu­dapest so it is look­ing more hope­ful than we were ex­pect­ing be­cause they are per­form­ing nowhere near what we are used to.”</p>
    <p>Sainz is mov­ing to Fer­rari next year to re­place four-time world cham­pion Se­bas­tian Vet­tel, adding spice to the cur­rent track bat­tle.</p>
    <p>“There have been jokes made, but noth­ing which is rubbing it in. I</p>
    <p>Years since McLaren won their last race in Formula One at the 2012 Brazil­ian Grand Prix. know how karma works and how eas­ily things can go the op­po­site way,” said Nor­ris of the ban­ter between him and Sainz, 25.</p>
    <p>“I think we’re go­ing to go to some races this sea­son where Fer­rari will beat us quite eas­ily and Car­los will be the one say­ing ‘Look who’s laugh­ing now’.</p>
    <p>“I know that Formula One can change and they will prob­a­bly do a very good job to re­turn back to their nor­mal ways of be­ing very com­pet­i­tive.”</p>
