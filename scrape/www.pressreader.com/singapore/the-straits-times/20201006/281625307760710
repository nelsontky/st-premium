    <p>To fur­ther re­open safely in the com­ing months, Sin­ga­pore is adopt­ing a four-pronged strat­egy to put it­self in the best po­si­tion to fight Covid-19, DPM Heng Swee Keat said.</p>
    <p>These four ar­eas are:</p>
    <p>1 Se­cur­ing early ac­cess to ef­fec­tive vac­cines.</p>
    <p>2 En­hanc­ing test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>3 Con­duct­ing swift con­tact trac­ing and iso­la­tion of in­fected in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>4 Ad­her­ing to safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>More de­tails on when Sin­ga­pore will en­ter the third stage of its phased re­open­ing will be re­leased by the multi-min­istry task force in the com­ing weeks, said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This road map will in­clude the ex­pected time­line for mov­ing to phase three, changes to cur­rent reg­u­la­tions on the size of group gath­er­ings, and par­tic­i­pa­tion at mass events, Mr Heng told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He was giv­ing a min­is­te­rial state­ment on Sin­ga­pore’s fight against Covid-19, its fis­cal po­si­tion, and strate­gies for the coun­try to emerge stronger from this cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing was meant to last sev­eral months, even as more mea­sures are lifted, while phase three is the “new nor­mal” un­til a vac­cine or treat­ment is found for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Last month, task force co-chair­man Lawrence Wong said the Gov­ern­ment was al­ready work­ing on a road map for the third and fi­nal phase, and that such plans would be shared when they were ready.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Heng, who is also Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Fi­nance Min­is­ter, said there are pro­found un­cer­tain­ties ahead.</p>
    <p>“In our fight against Covid-19, we are cur­rently in a sta­ble po­si­tion, but we must re­main vig­i­lant. Amid the un­cer­tain­ties, we are adapt­ing to liv­ing with the virus.”</p>
    <p>To fur­ther re­open safely in the com­ing months, Sin­ga­pore is adopt­ing a four-pronged strat­egy to put it­self in the best po­si­tion to fight Covid-19, he said.</p>
    <p>These four ar­eas are: Se­cur­ing early ac­cess to ef­fec­tive vac­cines, en­hanc­ing test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, con­duct­ing swift con­tact trac­ing and iso­la­tion of in­fected in­di­vid­u­als, and ad­her­ing to safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>De­spite un­cer­tain­ties about the global pan­demic, such as how suc­cess­ful other coun­tries are in con­tain­ing it as they open up their economies, there is hope that Sin­ga­pore can over­come this cri­sis, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>On vac­cines, Sin­ga­pore is work­ing very ac­tively to se­cure early ac­cess to safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cines, if and when they be­come avail­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng noted that Sin­ga­pore is an early sup­porter of the Covid-19 Vac­cine Global Ac­cess (Covax) Fa­cil­ity, which ac­cel­er­ates the de­vel­op­ment and pro­duc­tion of, and eq­ui­table ac­cess to po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cines. To­gether with Switzer­land, Sin­ga­pore co-chairs the Friends of the Covax Fa­cil­ity to pro­mote vac­cine mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is pur­su­ing the pro­cure­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines with a num­ber of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies, sup­port­ing lo­cal ef­forts to de­velop one, and build­ing up lo­cal vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>On test­ing, the coun­try has also in­creased poly­merase chain re­ac­tion tests man­i­fold, and is close to its tar­get of be­ing able to con­duct 40,000 lab­o­ra­tory tests a day.</p>
    <p>“We are also eval­u­at­ing new test­ing tech­nolo­gies that are less in­va­sive and can pro­duce test re­sults more quickly. This en­hanced test­ing ca­pa­bil­ity will help us safely re­sume more ac­tiv­i­ties sooner,” Mr Heng added.</p>
    <p>As for con­tact trac­ing and iso­lat­ing in­fected peo­ple, he said do­ing so swiftly was key to lim­it­ing the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>“Our con­tact trac­ing teams are do­ing a ster­ling job, and us­ing dig­i­tal tools well. The TraceTo­gether app, to­gether with to­kens that are be­ing dis­trib­uted na­tion­wide, and the SafeEn­try pro­gramme, en­able con­tact trac­ing to reach the speed and cov­er­age needed to rapidly con­tain vi­ral trans­mis­sion.”</p>
    <p>Safe man­age­ment mea­sures must also con­tinue to be ad­hered to. “Keep­ing com­mu­nity in­fec­tions low is the key to re­open­ing our econ­omy safely,” he added.</p>
