    <p>•</p>
    <p>PARIS An emo­tional Pe­tra Kvi­tova yes­ter­day hailed her first ap­pear­ance in the French Open quar­ter-fi­nals since 2012 as a wel­come re­minder of the two-time Wim­ble­don cham­pion’s abil­ity on all sur­faces.</p>
    <p>The Czech sev­enth seed cruised into the last eight at Roland Gar­ros for just the sec­ond time in her ca­reer with a 6-2, 6-4 win over China’s Zhang Shuai.</p>
    <p>Her su­pe­rior fire­power proved de­ci­sive as she blasted 23 win­ners to Zhang’s nine. She dom­i­nated from the base­line and was 4-0 up in 15 minutes, wrap­ping up the match 70 minutes later.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter eight years to be in the quar­ter-fi­nal again, it’s great. I’m re­ally happy for that, that I’m still able to play on all sur­faces,” she said af­ter her fourth suc­ces­sive straight­sets vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Her best run in Paris came when she lost to even­tual cham­pion Maria Shara­pova in the semi-fi­nals in 2012. “I think I wasn’t re­ally the player who ever suc­ceeded on clay. At that time was such a great thing for me to be in the semi-fi­nals... I think it’s been a mir­a­cle for me to make the semi-fi­nal here in Roland Gar­ros,” added the 30-year-old, who missed last year’s tour­na­ment due to an arm in­jury. “I got a bit emo­tional last two points of my match.”</p>
    <p>Court Philippe Cha­trier holds spe­cial mem­o­ries for Kvi­tova as the site of her come­back in 2017 – six months af­ter a knife at­tack that al­most ended her ca­reer. She suf­fered se­ri­ous in­juries to her left play­ing hand when she fought off a knife-wield­ing bur­glar at her home in Proste­jov in De­cem­ber 2016.</p>
    <p>“Happy mem­o­ries, when I made my come­back here 2017, when I step on the Philippe Cha­trier, I couldn’t re­ally imag­ine me to be in the quar­ter-fi­nal of this Slam,” said Kvi­tova, who will climb back into the top 10 fol­low­ing her per­for­mance in Paris. “It’s been a long ride def­i­nitely.”</p>
    <p>Kvi­tova, a run­ner-up to Naomi Osaka at last year’s Aus­tralian Open, has won the ma­jor­ity of her 27 ti­tles on hard courts but is a ca­pa­ble clay per­former as well. She has won five of her six fi­nals on the sur­face, with three of her past five ti­tles com­ing on clay in­clud­ing the most re­cent at Stuttgart last year.</p>
    <p>She will next face world No. 66 Laura Siege­mund, the old­est player left in the draw at 32. The Ger­man beat Spain’s Paula Ba­dosa 7-5, 6-2 to reach her first Grand Slam quar­ter-fi­nal af­ter or­der­ing a plate of food to be de­liv­ered to her on court.</p>
    <p>She ate while Ba­dosa, who was af­fected by an ap­par­ent back in­jury, was tak­ing a med­i­cal time out.</p>
    <p>“I was try­ing to get some carbs in,” she said, hav­ing strug­gled to eat be­fore her match. “Prob­a­bly looks weird hav­ing a fork and eat­ing like that, but bet­ter than low sugar any­way.”</p>
    <p>Energised by her food in­take, she won 10 of the last 12 games.</p>
    <p>Fans can feast on an­other up­com­ing quar­ter-fi­nal, with Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas set to meet An­drey Rublev in a re­peat of the re­cent Ham­burg fi­nal which was won by the Rus­sian.</p>
    <p>Rublev also won ti­tles in Qatar and Ade­laide this sea­son and only world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic has won more matches and tro­phies this year.</p>
    <p>He kept up his good form, beat­ing Hun­gary’s Mar­ton Fucso­vics 6-7 (4-7), 7-5, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3).</p>
    <p>Tsit­si­pas brushed aside Grigor Dim­itrov 6-3, 7-6 (11-9), 6-2. The Greek has now won 12 suc­ces­sive sets at the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>“The tiebreak was where all the money went. I tried to take it point by point, I showed a lot of dis­ci­pline,” said last year’s ATP Fi­nals win­ner. “It was a very re­spon­si­ble win in the sec­ond set.”</p>
    <p>Happy mem­o­ries, when I made my come­back here 2017, when I step on the Philippe Cha­trier, I couldn’t re­ally imag­ine me to be in the quar­ter-fi­nal of this Slam. It’s been a long ride def­i­nitely.</p>
