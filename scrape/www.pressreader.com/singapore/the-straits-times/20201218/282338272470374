    <p>NOVEM­BER 2015</p>
    <p>An in­de­pen­dent com­mis­sion set up by the World Anti-Dop­ing Agency (Wada) found a “deeply rooted cul­ture of cheat­ing” in Rus­sian ath­let­ics, which it said the state se­cu­rity ser­vices col­luded with. It rec­om­mended that Rus­sia be banned from in­ter­na­tional ath­let­ics.</p>
    <p>Days af­ter the pub­li­ca­tion of the re­port, the sport’s gov­ern­ing body, the IAAF, banned Rus­sia’s ath­let­ics fed­er­a­tion (Rusaf) while Wada de­clared the Rus­sian Anti-Dop­ing Agency (Rusada) non-com­pli­ant.</p>
    <p>MAY 2016</p>
    <p>The New York Times re­ported that dozens of Rus­sian ath­letes who com­peted at the 2014 Sochi Win­ter Olympics, in­clud­ing at least 15 medal win­ners, were part of a state-run dop­ing pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The re­port was based on ev­i­dence from whis­tle-blower Grig­ory Rod­chenkov, the di­rec­tor of the coun­try’s anti-dop­ing lab­o­ra­tory dur­ing the Games.</p>
    <p>JULY 2016</p>
    <p>An in­de­pen­dent com­mis­sion set up to in­ves­ti­gate the al­le­ga­tions in the Times re­port, re­vealed ev­i­dence of widespread state-spon­sored dop­ing by ath­letes at the Sochi Games. It said that the Rus­sian Min­istry of Sport over­saw the ma­nip­u­la­tion of ath­letes’ an­a­lyt­i­cal re­sults and sam­ple swop­ping and rec­om­mended that Rus­sia be banned from the Rio Olympics the fol­low­ing month.</p>
    <p>But the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) said it would al­low each sport­ing fed­er­a­tion to make its own de­ci­sion. Rus­sia re­mained banned from ath­let­ics but com­peted in most other sports and won 19 gold medals.</p>
    <p>AU­GUST 2017</p>
    <p>Rus­sia re­mained barred from ath­let­ics but 19 of its ath­letes were al­lowed to com­pete at the world cham­pi­onships in London as neu­trals af­ter be­ing vet­ted by the IAAF.</p>
    <p>DE­CEM­BER 2017</p>
    <p>The IOC sus­pended the Rus­sian Olympic Com­mit­tee and banned the coun­try from the Pyeongchan­g Win­ter Games the fol­low­ing Fe­bru­ary but said it would al­low Rus­sian ath­letes to com­pete as neu­trals “as long as they sat­isfy strict con­di­tions that show they have a dop­ingfree back­ground”.</p>
    <p>FE­BRU­ARY 2018</p>
    <p>Some 168 Rus­sians com­peted as part of a neu­tral “Olympic Ath­lete from Rus­sia” team but two failed drug tests – medal-win­ning curler Alexan­der Krushel­nit­sky and bob­sleigher Nadezhda Sergeeva.</p>
    <p>The Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport (CAS) later ac­cepted Sergeeva’s ap­peal that the failed test “likely re­sulted from a con­tam­i­nated prod­uct”.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia was re­in­stated by the IOC af­ter the re­main­ing tests of its ath­letes at the Pyeongchan­g Games re­turned neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>SEPTEM­BER 2018</p>
    <p>Wada’s ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee voted to re­in­state Rusada be­fore it had ful­filled the re­quire­ments laid out in a “Roadmap to Com­pli­ance”, which in­cluded giv­ing ac­cess to data stored at Moscow’s anti-dop­ing lab­o­ra­tory.</p>
    <p>JAN­UARY 2019</p>
    <p>Wada ex­tracted dop­ing data from the dis­cred­ited Moscow lab­o­ra­tory, in­clud­ing more than 2,000 sam­ples, three weeks af­ter the dead­line it had set Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>SEPTEM­BER 2019</p>
    <p>Wada said his­tor­i­cal data sup­plied by the coun­try’s anti-dop­ing au­thor­ity con­tained “in­con­sis­ten­cies” and that Rusada faced an­other sus­pen­sion. The IAAF, now World Ath­let­ics (WA), main­tained its ban on Rus­sia, which was ex­cluded from the world cham­pi­onships.</p>
    <p>NOVEM­BER 2019</p>
    <p>A Wada com­pli­ance com­mit­tee rec­om­mended that Rus­sia re­ceive a four-year Olympic ban as part of a sanc­tions pack­age to pun­ish Moscow for pro­vid­ing the agency with doc­tored and in­com­plete lab­o­ra­tory data. Then Sports Min­is­ter Pavel Kolobkov at­trib­uted dis­crep­an­cies in the data to tech­ni­cal is­sues.</p>
    <p>DE­CEM­BER 2019</p>
    <p>Wada sus­pends Rus­sia from all ma­jor sport­ing events for four years.</p>
    <p>JAN­UARY 2020</p>
    <p>Wada sus­pended the Moscow lab­o­ra­tory from car­ry­ing out blood sam­ple anal­y­sis af­ter an in­ves­ti­ga­tion found data from the fa­cil­ity had been ma­nip­u­lated.</p>
    <p>MARCH 2020</p>
    <p>WA al­lows no more than 10 Rus­sian track and field ath­letes to com­pete as neu­trals at the post­poned Tokyo Olympics. It handed out a US$10 mil­lion (S$13.25 mil­lion) fine, which the fed­er­a­tion failed to pay un­til it was threat­ened with ex­pul­sion from the world body.</p>
