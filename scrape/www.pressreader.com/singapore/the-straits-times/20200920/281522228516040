    <p>No bustling large-scale mall atrium moon­cake fairs? No prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Most of this year’s moon­cake hus­tle is hap­pen­ing on­line, with busi­nesses see­ing a surge in the lead-up to the Mid-Au­tumn Fes­ti­val on Oct 1.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to their own e-com­merce sites, many moon­cake pur­vey­ors have gone onto mul­ti­ple on­line plat­forms such as Qoo10 and Lazada, which pro­vide the ease of or­der­ing across mul­ti­ple ven­dors as well as de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Takashimay­a De­part­ment Store and Tangs – tra­di­tion­ally known for their an­nual atrium moon­cake fairs – also re­tail moon­cakes on­line now. Both also have a re­duced num­ber of moon­cake booths op­er­at­ing within store premises.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness own­ers note that since the pan­demic hit, con­sumers have be­come used to or­der­ing food on­line, which has helped to boost moon­cake sales this year.</p>
    <p>Some pur­vey­ors are on dif­fer­ent plat­forms to max­imise ex­po­sure and sales. Neigh­bour­hood bak­ery Gin Thye, which op­er­ates out of Sem­bawang Road and has built its name as a her­itage brand on­line, is listed on many e-stores in­clud­ing Lazada, Qoo10 and Shopee, of­ten with dif­fer­en­ti­ated moon­cake of­fer­ings to stand out in a crowded on­line mar­ket­place.</p>
    <p>It worked with Shopee to cre­ate ex­clu­sive bun­dles such as a Snow Skin Premium Bam­boo Char­coal Red Prawn Moon­cake and White Skin Durian Mochi bun­dle, which has made up more than 20 per cent of its to­tal sales.</p>
    <p>Gin Thye’s e-com­merce con­sul­tant Alan Siek, 30, says more than half of its moon­cake sales are via Shopee. Com­pared with last year, on­line sales have in­creased by 250 per cent, while off­line sales have in­creased by 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>Sales for home-grown brand Mdm Ling Bak­ery “in­creased three- to four­fold” com­pared with last year, when it de­buted its moon­cakes. It is on plat­forms such as Klook, Pick­upp, Shopee, Lazada and Grab.</p>
    <p>With sam­pling not al­lowed be­cause of the pan­demic, Mdm Ling Bak­ery’s co-founder Eve­lyn Lim’s strat­egy is to send sam­ples to ex­ist­ing cus­tomers who make on­line pur­chases. This has trans­lated into strong sales of her new cook­iein­spired flavours such as pink Hi­malayan salt cho­co­late al­mond moon­cakes and premium Mao Shan Wang durian moon­cakes. She fore­sees sell­ing out her stock soon.</p>
    <p>In­deed, all on­line plat­forms have seen an uptick in the num­ber of moon­cake mer­chants sell­ing through their sites, and brisk sales.</p>
    <p>E-store Shopee Sin­ga­pore’s in­au­gu­ral moon­cake fair started last year with about 10 brands, but has ex­panded to more than 30 brands this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Tiger Wang, head of mar­ket­ing for Shopee Sin­ga­pore, ob­serves a mix of re­turn­ing brands such as Gin Thye, Emi­cakes and Golden Mo­ments as well as new­com­ers from big-name ho­tels such as Raf­fles Ho­tel and Shangri-La Ho­tel, Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Moon­cake­fair.com, which was set up in July by Sin­popo Fairs – the sis­ter com­pany of cho­co­late cake chain Aw­fully Cho­co­late – to sup­port fel­low moon­cake re­tail­ers, has also seen more tra­di­tional moon­cake re­tail­ers, such as Tai Chong Kok and Spring Court, sell­ing moon­cakes on its on­line plat­form for the first time.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, many more moon­cake mer­chants have listed on Grab this year, says a Grab spokesman, adding that its moon­cake sales have tripled from last year.</p>
    <p>Other trend­ing flavours this year in­clude snowskin durian moon­cakes, along with tra­di­tional baked ones that usu­ally have a longer shelf-life.</p>
    <p>Mr Jonathan Lim, founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of on­line or­der­ing sys­tem Od­dle, says tra­di­tional baked moon­cakes have made up about 80 per cent of sales.</p>
    <p>Can­tonese restau­rant Yan at Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore sold out its moon­cakes by the sec­ond week of this month.</p>
    <p>Due to lower pro­jected sales, it re­duced pro­duc­tion vol­ume by about 40 per cent, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous year, says its gen­eral man­ager Shek Chi Kuen, 57.</p>
    <p>But it was cheered by the un­ex­pect­edly pos­i­tive on­line or­ders. Mr Shek adds: “We are con­sid­er­ing try­ing out other on­line plat­forms to cre­ate more mer­chan­dis­ing chan­nels for the up­com­ing gift­ing sea­son and for our Chi­nese New Year good­ies.”</p>
