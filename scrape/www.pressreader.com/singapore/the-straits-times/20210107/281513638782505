    <p>Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties yes­ter­day im­posed travel re­stric­tions and banned gath­er­ings in the cap­i­tal city of He­bei prov­ince, which sur­rounds Bei­jing, in the lat­est es­ca­la­tion of mea­sures to stave off an­other coro­n­avirus wave.</p>
    <p>The prov­ince, which en­tered a “wartime mode” on Tues­day, re­ported 20 new con­firmed cases, as well as 43 asymp­to­matic ones – vir­tu­ally all from the provin­cial cap­i­tal of Shi­ji­azhuang, about 300km from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>China has par­tially sealed off the city of Shi­ji­azhuang in north­ern He­bei prov­ince, af­ter 63 con­firmed cases of Covid-19 re­ported on Tues­day sparked fear that this could her­ald a new wave of in­fec­tions in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The prov­ince neigh­bour­ing the Chi­nese cap­i­tal de­clared it was go­ing into “war-time mode” af­ter re­port­ing a spike in cases on Tues­day night. The provin­cial au­thor­i­ties re­ported 20 new con­firmed cases, as well as 43 asymp­to­matic ones – vir­tu­ally all from the provin­cial cap­i­tal of Shi­ji­azhuang, about 300km from Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>China does not in­clude asymp­to­matic cases in its of­fi­cial tally, but the com­bined num­ber of cases, both symp­to­matic and asymp­to­matic, on Tues­day marks the sin­gle largest daily rise in lo­cal cases since Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>A num­ber of the in­fected peo­ple had at­tended var­i­ous wed­ding ban­quets or cel­e­bra­tions in the city in the past few days.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor in­dus­trial hub known for its poor air qual­ity, the city of 11 mil­lion peo­ple kicked off mass test­ing yes­ter­day in line with pro­to­col when spo­radic clus­ters emerge.</p>
    <p>But there are signs this could mark the start of a more se­ri­ous out­break – expert teams from Bei­jing have been sent to the prov­ince and move­ment curbs have been put in place as the au­thor­i­ties im­ple­mented what seems to be a par­tial lock­down.</p>
    <p>In­ter­city buses as well as many inbound and out­bound flights to Shi­ji­azhuang have been can­celled.</p>
    <p>The sale of train tick­ets to Bei­jing was also sus­pended yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Traf­fic on 10 high­ways con­nect­ing Shi­ji­azhuang to Bei­jing and other prov­inces have also been re­stricted, with traf­fic po­lice urg­ing ve­hi­cles on both sides to re­turn to where they came from.</p>
    <p>Shi­ji­azhuang res­i­dent Ma Ying­nan told The Straits Times that peo­ple in the city were mostly holed up at home and wait­ing to get a no­tice to go for mass nu­cleic acid tests.</p>
    <p>“There are not a lot of peo­ple on the streets. Peo­ple are wor­ried but what can you do? We are just wait­ing to be no­ti­fied (to get tested),” said the 30-year-old.</p>
    <p>In a meet­ing on Tues­day with the provin­cial au­thor­i­ties, Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion direc­tor Ma Xiaowei said the sit­u­a­tion in He­bei was “se­vere” and still de­vel­op­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Feng Zi­jian, deputy direc­tor of the Chi­nese Cen­tre for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion, said the virus strain spread­ing in He­bei was not lo­cal to China and was pos­si­bly linked to the strains in Eu­rope, state broad­caster CCTV re­ported on Tues­day. He added that the num­ber of cases would likely con­tinue to climb and that the virus had been spread­ing un­de­tected for some time.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent clus­ter in He­bei first emerged on Sun­day, when one case was re­ported in Xing­tai city, ad­ja­cent to Shi­ji­azhuang. A raft of cases was un­cov­ered in the days fol­low­ing that. Be­fore this out­break, the last lo­cal trans­mis­sions in He­bei oc­curred in June.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion in He­bei has caused jitters in the Chi­nese cap­i­tal, which ad­joins the prov­ince and is also bat­tling its own out­break.</p>
    <p>City of­fi­cials said on Tues­day that in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers ar­riv­ing in Bei­jing must quar­an­tine for 21 days, seven more than pre­vi­ously re­quired, af­ter cases in the cap­i­tal tested pos­i­tive fol­low­ing their re­lease from quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Bei­jing of­fi­cials also urged peo­ple who have trav­elled to Shi­ji­azhuang or Xing­tai re­cently to re­port their travel his­tory to their lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Dr Jin Dong-Yan, a vi­rol­ogy pro­fes­sor at the Univer­sity of Hong Kong, said it was “wor­ry­ing” that the virus had been spread­ing un­no­ticed for a while and the cur­rent cases could be the “tip of the ice­berg”.</p>
    <p>With the re­sump­tion of mass gath­er­ings in China, “it’s al­most back to pre-Covid-19 times, so if cases go un­de­tected, there can be su­per­spreader events”, he added.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous Chi­nese ci­ties in­clud­ing Bei­jing and Shang­hai are vac­ci­nat­ing thou­sands each day af­ter a vac­cine by Sinopharm re­ceived con­di­tional ap­proval last week.</p>
