    <p>Q Can my boss re­quire me to re­turn to the of­fice, even if my job can be per­formed from home and I pre­fer do­ing so?</p>
    <p>A Yes. How­ever, your em­ployer should en­sure that you are work­ing from home for at least half your work­ing time. This should be cal­cu­lated over a “rea­son­able pe­riod of time” not ex­ceed­ing four weeks.</p>
    <p>If you are a part-time worker, the re­quire­ment will be pro-rated. For ex­am­ple, if you work three days a week, you should be in the of­fice only 11/ days a week.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Your em­ployer should also make sure that not more than half the peo­ple who can work from home are in the of­fice at any one time.</p>
    <p>Q I want to go back to the of­fice full time be­cause my home is not con­ducive for work. Can I do so?</p>
    <p>A As long as your job can be done from home, you should be work­ing from home at least half the time.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers will need to demon­strate the busi­ness or op­er­a­tional rea­sons why staff can­not work from home, de­spite re­view­ing work pro­cesses and ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Q Will my leave days count to­wards the to­tal num­ber of days I spend work­ing from home?</p>
    <p>A Yes. For ex­am­ple, if you nor­mally work a five-day week, you are al­lowed to go back to the of­fice for 21/ days ev­ery week. If you de­cide</p>
    <p>2 to take two days of leave that week, your boss can still re­quire you to go back to the of­fice for 21/ days. You</p>
    <p>2 will then spend the re­main­ing half day work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>Q My boss wants me to go back to the of­fice for reg­u­lar meet­ings. Is this al­lowed?</p>
    <p>A Yes, al­though the Gov­ern­ment has said that meet­ings should be con­ducted vir­tu­ally as far as pos­si­ble. Phys­i­cal meet­ings be­tween em­ploy­ees and sup­pli­ers or con­trac­tors should be min­imised. One ex­am­ple of a flex­i­ble work ar­range­ment would be for staff to go back to the of­fice only for meet­ings, and work from home for the rest of the day.</p>
    <p>Q I have a chronic med­i­cal con­di­tion that has weak­ened my im­mune sys­tem. What should I do if I have to go back to the of­fice?</p>
    <p>A Em­ploy­ers should pay spe­cial at­ten­tion to work­ers who are more vul­ner­a­ble to the coronaviru­s. Your em­ployer should make ar­range­ments such as al­low­ing you to work from home and pro­vid­ing IT equip­ment if nec­es­sary, or tem­po­rar­ily re­de­ploy­ing you to an­other role within the com­pany.</p>
    <p>If there is no way to make al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments, your em­ployer can still re­quire you to re­turn to the</p>
    <p>Your em­ployer should en­sure that you are work­ing from home for at least half your work­ing time. This should be cal­cu­lated over a “rea­son­able pe­riod of time” not ex­ceed­ing four weeks. If you are a part-time worker, the re­quire­ment will be pro-rated. For ex­am­ple, if you work three days a week, you should be in the of­fice only 11/ days a week.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Your em­ployer should also make sure that not more than half the peo­ple who can work from home are in the of­fice at any one time.</p>
    <p>of­fice. How­ever, they must en­sure that there is at least 1m of space be­tween you and your col­leagues.</p>
    <p>This ap­plies to peo­ple who have com­pro­mised im­mune sys­tems, con­cur­rent med­i­cal con­di­tions, or who are aged 60 and above.</p>
    <p>Q Since I am go­ing back to the of­fice, does that mean I can in­ter­act with col­leagues as usual?</p>
    <p>A No. You have to wear a mask at all times, un­less the na­ture of your work or the work en­vi­ron­ment</p>
    <p>makes do­ing so pro­hib­i­tive. You should be at least 1m apart from your col­leagues in the of­fice, in­clud­ing at your work­sta­tion and dur­ing meet­ings. You should also not gather in groups larger than the pre­vail­ing per­mit­ted group size for so­cial gath­er­ings, even dur­ing meals or smoke breaks.</p>
    <p>Q Ac­cord­ing to the latest up­date, work-re­lated events of up to 50 peo­ple can now take place in the of­fice. What is con­sid­ered</p>
    <p>a work-re­lated event?</p>
    <p>A Work-re­lated events i nclude meet­ings, train­ing ses­sions, town­hall meet­ings, cor­po­rate re­treats, ten­der brief­ings to ven­dors, and busi­ness con­fer­ences as well as on­board­ing or re­trench­ment ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>They do not in­clude cel­e­bra­tions, par­ties, din­ner and dance events, team bond­ing ac­tiv­i­ties or gala din­ners. Em­ploy­ers should not or­gan­ise or en­cour­age so­cial gath­er­ings within or out­side the of­fice.</p>
    <p>Food and drinks should not be served at such events as far as pos­si­ble. If deemed nec­es­sary, work­ers must be seated and served in­di­vid­u­ally and meal du­ra­tions kept short.</p>
    <p>Q I am an em­ployer. With more staff al­lowed to go back to the work­place, how can I avoid crowd­ing?</p>
    <p>A You should stag­ger start times such that at least half your em­ploy­ees reach the of­fice at or af­ter 10am. You should also im­ple­ment flex­i­ble work­place ar­range­ments – for in</p>
    <p>stance, ar­rang­ing for some em­ploy­ees to work from home in the morn­ing but re­turn to the of­fice from 1pm to 5pm. Al­ter­na­tively, you could re­quire them to re­turn to the of­fice only for meet­ings.</p>
    <p>If pos­si­ble, you should im­ple­ment shift or split team op­er­a­tions, and en­sure that there is no mix­ing of em­ploy­ees from the dif­fer­ent teams.</p>
    <p>Q Can I hold reli­gious cer­e­monies, such as prayers, at the work­place?</p>
    <p>A Yes, but with only up to 30 peo­ple at a time, or fewer if there is in­suf­fi­cient space for safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one should wear a mask and keep 1m apart. Meals are pro­hib­ited, and singing and other live per­for­mances are also not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Q My em­ployer is break­ing the rules. How can I re­port this?</p>
    <p>A You can do so via the SnapSafe app, which can be found in Ap­ple’s App Store or the Google Play Store.</p>
