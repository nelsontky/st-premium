    <p>An in­dus­trial gas sup­ply firm and its chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer failed to take nec­es­sary mea­sures to en­sure work­place safety, lead­ing to a fa­tal blast that killed a chemist in 2015.</p>
    <p>New mother Lim Siaw Chian, 30, was killed and at least seven oth­ers were in­jured af­ter an ex­plo­sion at Lee­den Na­tional Oxy­gen’s Spe­cialty Gas Cen­tre Qual­ity Con­trol Lab­o­ra­tory on Oct 12 that year.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim had re­turned to work from ma­ter­nity leave a week be­fore the tragedy at the lab­o­ra­tory in Tan­jong Kling Road near Pioneer Road.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Malaysian had re­ceived her Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen­ship just a month be­fore she died. She left behind a daugh­ter who was six months old at the time.</p>
    <p>Lee­den Na­tional Oxy­gen and its CEO Steven Tham Weng Cheong, now 69, each pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to an of­fence un­der the Work­place Safety and Health Act.</p>
    <p>Among other things, they had failed to take mea­sures to en­sure that un­safe mod­i­fied reg­u­la­tory valve as­sem­blies were not used when test­ing com­bustible gases. They had also failed to en­sure that there was a sys­tem in place for the ac­cu­rate track­ing of gas cylin­ders.</p>
    <p>Min­istry of Man­power prose­cu­tor Er­diana Ha­zlina said that Ms Lim was car­ry­ing out gas anal­y­sis on a cylin­der shortly be­fore the ex­plo­sion oc­curred. Ms Lim was last seen touch­ing a reg­u­la­tory valve assem­bly (RVA) con­nected to a cylin­der, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Ms Er­diana added: “The said RVA was found to have been mod­i­fied with an un­qual­i­fied welded joint. The fail­ure of the welded joint... was found to have pre-ex­isted but was not pru­dently checked be­fore us­age prior to the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“The fail­ure of the un­qual­i­fied welded joint... re­sulted in a leak of flammable meth­ane-oxy­gen­ni­tro­gen mix from the RVA dur­ing the test­ing of the cylin­der.”</p>
    <p>The court heard that the leak­ing gas mix­ture could have been ig­nited by the fric­tional heat gen­er­ated due to the es­cap­ing gas mix­ture.</p>
    <p>An ex­plo­sion oc­curred and the en­su­ing blaze en­gulfed the ground-floor lab­o­ra­tory. Of­fi­cers from the Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force were then de­ployed to the scene.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim’s charred re­mains were later found on six oc­ca­sions over a two-month pe­riod. They were iden­ti­fied us­ing her daugh­ter’s DNA.</p>
    <p>In 2016, then State Coro­ner Marvin Bay found that Ms Lim had died of blast in­juries. He also found her death to be an in­dus­trial mis­ad­ven­ture.</p>
    <p>Both of­fend­ers are ex­pected to be sen­tenced on Jan 12 next year.</p>
