    <p>• Play­ers should stop head­ing the ball in train­ing if re­search proves it leads to de­men­tia when they are older, said sev­eral Pre­mier League man­agers since the topic came to the fore fol­low­ing the death of Eng­land’s Nobby Stiles at age 78 last month.</p>
    <p>Stiles and many of his 1966 World Cup-win­ning team­mates had been di­ag­nosed with de­men­tia be­fore their deaths while the fam­ily of Manch­ester United great Bobby Charl­ton, 83, also dis­closed his di­ag­no­sis re­cently.</p>
    <p>Stiles’ fam­ily hoped it would be a cat­a­lyst for ad­dress­ing the dis­ease while Ge­off Hurst, Eng­land’s hat-trick hero from the 1966 fi­nal, said head­ing the ball of­ten in prac­tice was dan­ger­ous and kids should not be do­ing it at all.</p>
    <p>West Bromwich Al­bion man­ager Slaven Bilic told re­porters: “If they find out through the re­search that head­ing the ball 10 times dur­ing train­ing is go­ing to cause you de­men­tia, then let’s stop it.</p>
    <p>“For me, the great thing is they are talk­ing about it and recog­nis­ing it.”</p>
    <p>Chelsea’s Frank Lam­pard said he is now con­sid­er­ing how his play­ers train and favoured rules to curb head­ing in youth foot­ball be­fore im­ple­ment­ing guide­lines higher up the pyra­mid.</p>
    <p>“The rules need to be stronger to make sure we’re not mak­ing younger chil­dren head it if they don’t need to,” he said. “Any­thing we can do to make things safer, we should.”</p>
    <p>As­ton Villa’s Dean Smith, whose fa­ther was di­ag­nosed with de­men­tia be­fore he died of Covid-19 this year, echoed Bilic’s views about need­ing more re­search.</p>
    <p>“I think if there is a cor­re­la­tion be­tween head­ing a foot­ball and de­men­tia, then we need to do some­thing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The balls were heav­ier back then. We are all sad­dened about the for­mer play­ers who are suf­fer­ing with de­men­tia.”</p>
