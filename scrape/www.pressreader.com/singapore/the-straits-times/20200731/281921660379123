    <p>CAPE CANAVERAL (Florida) • When Nasa’s Per­se­ver­ance rover ar­rives in Mars, mis­sion man­agers will be watch­ing, help­less to do any­thing.</p>
    <p>The US$2.4 bil­lion (S$3.3 bil­lion) space­craft will hit the top of the Mar­tian at­mos­phere at more than 19,300kmh and then come to a com­plete stop seven min­utes later.</p>
    <p>That the one-tonne rover will end up on Mars on the af­ter­noon of Feb 18 is nearly cer­tain.</p>
    <p>The next-gen­er­a­tion Mars rover lifted off from Cape Canaveral yes­ter­day on a mis­sion to search for traces of po­ten­tial past life on Earth’s plan­e­tary neigh­bour.</p>
    <p>It soared into the sky from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Sta­tion at 7.50am l ocal time un­der clear, sunny and warm con­di­tions, car­ried by an At­las 5 rocket from Boe­ing-Lock­heed joint ven­ture United Launch Al­liance.</p>
    <p>The space­craft’s nav­i­ga­tors will have put the robotic ex­plorer on a col­li­sion course with the planet.</p>
    <p>The only ques­tion is whether Per­se­ver­ance will be on the ground in one piece or smashed to bits.</p>
    <p>Space­craft from Europe and the Soviet Union have made it all the way to the Red Planet, only to end up as ex­pen­sive scorch marks on its dusty sur­face.</p>
    <p>But the Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion has a good track record with Mars. It is the only space agency so far to pull off a suc­cess­ful mis­sion on the sur­face of the Red Planet.</p>
    <p>Per­se­ver­ance is largely the same de­sign as the Cu­rios­ity rover, which set down in 2012 and will have the same con­vo­luted but now tried-and-true “sky crane” land­ing chore­og­ra­phy.</p>
    <p>“When peo­ple look at it, it looks crazy,” Nasa en­gi­neer Adam Steltzner said in a video lead­ing up to Cu­rios­ity’s land­ing that de­scribed the com­po­nents: heat shield, para­chute, rocket en­gines and, fi­nally, a hov­er­ing crane that low­ered the rover to the sur­face.</p>
    <p>“That’s a very nat­u­ral thing,” he said. “Some­times when we look at it, it looks crazy. It is the re­sult of rea­soned, en­gi­neer­ing thought. But it still looks crazy.”</p>
    <p>While ev­ery­thing worked, the en­gi­neers got a chance to take a look at what could be im­proved this time around. “We don’t usu­ally get a chance to kind of redo or fix the mis­takes we made last time,” Dr Allen Chen, who leads the Per­se­ver­ance en­try, de­scent and land­ing team for Nasa’s Jet Propul­sion Lab­o­ra­tory, said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Cu­rios­ity ac­tu­ally landed too slowly, hit­ting the ground at 2.25kmh in­stead of the 2.73kmh that had been ex­pected.</p>
    <p>That, by it­self, was not a prob­lem. A softer land­ing is gen­tler on the space­craft. But the en­gi­neers wanted to un­der­stand what had hap­pened in or­der to make sure that the next land­ing – that of Per­se­ver­ance – did not come down faster than in­tended. It turns out that their cal­cu­la­tion of the grav­ity of Mars was slightly wrong.</p>
    <p>In ar­eas of the planet that pos­sess less mass – like the 154kmwide crater that Cu­rios­ity landed in – the pull of grav­ity is a bit weaker.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t have suf­fi­cient fidelity in our grav­ity mod­el­ling to un­der­stand that the grav­ity there was ac­tu­ally dif­fer­ent than else­where on the planet,” Dr Chen said. “So that was one thing that we fixed.”</p>
    <p>An­other com­po­nent that was tweaked was the para­chute that is un­furled when the space­craft is hurl­ing down at su­per­sonic speeds.</p>
    <p>A para­chute fail­ure in a pro­to­type test of a fu­ture Mars land­ing sys­tem led Dr Chen’s team to make sure it had not just got­ten lucky with Cu­rios­ity.</p>
    <p>“That gave us pause,” he said.</p>
    <p>The en­gi­neers are now con­fi­dent of Per­se­ver­ance’s para­chute after tests of a strength­ened de­sign.</p>
    <p>One ma­jor ad­di­tion to Per­se­ver­ance is what Nasa calls “ter­rain-rel­a­tive nav­i­ga­tion”. A cam­era on the space­craft will take pic­tures of the land­scape and match them with its stored maps. It would then steer to what looks like the safest land­ing spot it can.</p>
    <p>“I don’t need the whole place to be flat and bor­ing,” Dr Chen said. “I just need parts of it that I can reach to be flat and bor­ing.”</p>
    <p>With­out this sys­tem, there would be more than a one-in-five chance that Per­se­ver­ance would end up some­where un­for­tu­nate – dam­aged by a boul­der, tipped over on a steep slope or sur­rounded by sand traps. That would be an un­ac­cept­ably high risk for such a high-pro­file and ex­pen­sive mis­sion.</p>
    <p>If it works, the same tech­nol­ogy will be used when Nasa sends a mis­sion to pick up the rock sam­ples that Per­se­ver­ance will be col­lect­ing, part of the so-called Mars sam­ple re­turn. That space­craft will carry enough fuel that it is able not only to avoid ob­sta­cles but also to fly to a spe­cific lo­ca­tion, land­ing within tens of me­tres of the tar­get.</p>
    <p>Still, next Feb 18, the con­trol room at the Jet Propul­sion Lab­o­ra­tory is ex­pected to be full of ner­vous en­gi­neers watch­ing the teleme­try re­turn­ing from Per­se­ver­ance. That data will take min­utes to travel mil­lions of kilo­me­tres – far too far and too slow for any­one at Nasa to make last-sec­ond cor­rec­tions.</p>
    <p>“Mars is not for the faint of heart,” Dr Chen said.</p>
    <p>LOOKS CRAZY, BUT IT WORKS</p>
