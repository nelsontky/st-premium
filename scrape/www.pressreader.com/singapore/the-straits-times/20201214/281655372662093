    <p>Ed­u­ca­tor Su­ji­etra Jayasee­lan in­tended to set up a phys­i­cal af­ter-school coach­ing cen­tre for chil­dren in Petal­ing Jaya, Se­lan­gor, but her plan was scup­pered in March when Malaysia im­posed a par­tial shut­down to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ob­serv­ing her own chil­dren study at home when schools were shut, she in­stead launched Green Patch Academy, an on­line cen­tre of­fer­ing aca­demic and skills coach­ing for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“The on­line method had never crossed my mind be­fore. I also of­fered a very low price, bear­ing in mind the im­pact of the pan­demic on peo­ple’s fi­nances,” she told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Green Patch is just one of the nearly 280,000 new busi­nesses reg­is­tered in Malaysia be­tween March and Septem­ber, de­fy­ing the pan­demic gloom with fresh en­ter­prises in sec­tors such as food and bev­er­age, on­line re­tail and fit­ness.</p>
    <p>This fig­ure far out­paced the num­ber of busi­nesses that had shut­tered since March – at 32,469, ac­cord­ing to the Com­pa­nies Com­mis­sion – when the coun­try in­tro­duced dras­tic move­ment curbs to con­tain the out­break.</p>
    <p>En­tre­pre­neur De­vel­op­ment and Co­op­er­a­tives Min­is­ter Wan Ju­naidi Wan Jaa­far de­scribed this de­vel­op­ment as a sil­ver lin­ing, say­ing lo­cal en­trepreneur­s were adapt­ing their busi­ness mod­els to be re­silient dur­ing chal­leng­ing times.</p>
    <p>“I ap­plaud this as such a move is vi­tal for their busi­ness sur­vival. En­trepreneur­s must be in­no­va­tive, cre­ative and dy­namic to ad­just and adapt to what­ever sit­u­a­tion they are in,” Datuk Seri Wan Ju­naidi told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s econ­omy has not been spared the fall­out from the coro­n­avirus and is ex­pected to con­tract by up to 4.5 per cent this year. Mean­while, the lat­est Busi­ness Con­fi­dence In­dex, re­leased by lo­cal rat­ings agency RAM on Dec 7, stood at 35.9 per cent – still sub­stan­tially below the 50 per cent thresh­old needed for it to be read as op­ti­mistic.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, some en­trepreneur­s are forg­ing ahead.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor­ity of these new busi­nesses, Mr Wan Ju­naidi said, op­er­ate i n the food and bev­er­age sec­tor, fol­lowed closely by on­line re­tail shop­ping busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“An­other in­ter­est­ing area is also the fit­ness in­dus­try. Be­cause there are some peo­ple who are scared to go to gyms, there is an in­creas­ing de­mand for vir­tual fit­ness classes and per­sonal train­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>New en­trepreneur­s have pressed ahead with their busi­ness plans, all while piv­ot­ing on short no­tice when cir­cum­stances change.</p>
    <p>Ms Dhashene Letchu­manan, a for­mer marketing ex­ec­u­tive, had been plan­ning to sell her Skin Start beauty prod­ucts at phys­i­cal stores be­fore the pan­demic hit. By the time she launched her skin­care line, move­ment con­trols were in place, forc­ing her to switch to on­line re­tail.</p>
    <p>“I could have sold my prod­ucts through re­tail stores, booths or kiosks if there was no pan­demic. But now the best op­tion is to just stay on­line and use drop-ship­pers, which is a way to gen­er­ate in­come for oth­ers who have lost their jobs,” Ms Dhashene told ST, re­fer­ring to the prac­tice of sell­ing a prod­uct with­out hold­ing stock, leav­ing or­ders to be ful­filled by the whole­saler or an­other re­tailer.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, other new busi­nesses have been set up with the help of civil so­ci­ety or­gan­i­sa­tions and so­cial en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>A group of con­struc­tion work­ers who lost their jobs af­ter Covid-19 clus­ters were dis­cov­ered at their work­site now run The Nanas Lab, a busi­ness mak­ing pineap­ple jam.</p>
    <p>“They have been grow­ing pineap­ples to eat when their food sup­plies run out,” said Ms Raud­hah Nazran, CEO of so­cial en­ter­prise Ac­cel­er­ate Global. “We saw that as a busi­ness op­por­tu­nity and taught them how to mon­e­tise their farm.”</p>
