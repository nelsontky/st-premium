    <p>There were 226 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing one com­mu­nity case: An in­mate who was ad­mit­ted to Changi Pri­son Com­plex on July 30.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old Sri Lankan man, who is on a short-term visit pass, was tested as part of the Sin­ga­pore Pri­son Ser­vice’s proac­tive screen­ing of newly ad­mit­ted in­mates.</p>
    <p>He had been seg­re­gated from the gen­eral in­mate pop­u­la­tion since his ad­mis­sion, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said.</p>
    <p>The man also served an ear­lier sen­tence in pri­son but had tested neg­a­tive for his en­try and exit swabs then on July 2 and July 22, re­spec­tively. He is cur­rently un­linked to other known cases.</p>
    <p>The rest of yes­ter­day’s new pa­tients com­prise nine im­ported cases who had been placed on stay-home no­tice upon their ar­rival i n Sin­ga­pore from In­dia, Ja­pan and the Philip­pines, as well as 216 mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Among the im­ported cases was a one-year-old boy who ar­rived from In­dia last month. The In­dian na­tional was con­firmed to have the coro­n­avirus on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He holds a de­pen­dant’s pass and is a con­tact of a pre­vi­ous case.</p>
    <p>An­other im­ported case is a per­ma­nent res­i­dent – a 40-year-old man – who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from In­dia on July 22.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s Covid-19 pa­tient up­date takes Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 53,051.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity dur­ing a week has de­creased from five cases two weeks ago to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity dur­ing a week has also fallen from a daily av­er­age of three cases to one over the same pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>MOH also said in its up­date that the clus­ters linked to Kep­pel Ship­yard and Paya Le­bar Quar­ter Tower 2 have been closed be­cause no new cases have been linked to the clus­ters in the past two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods, or 28 days.</p>
    <p>With 253 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 47,164 have now fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease and been dis­charged.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 115 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 5,730 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity dur­ing a week has de­creased from five cases two weeks ago to two in the past week. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity dur­ing a week has also fallen from a daily av­er­age of three cases to one over the same pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>There is one pa­tient in crit­i­cal con­di­tion in the in­ten­sive care unit.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
