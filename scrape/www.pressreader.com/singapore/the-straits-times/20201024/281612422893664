    <p>The Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) has fallen short in its han­dling of re­cent sex­ual mis­con­duct al­le­ga­tions against for­mer Tem­busu Col­lege fel­low Jeremy Fer­nando, said the col­lege’s rec­tor, Pro­fes­sor Tommy Koh.</p>
    <p>It has pledged to be more open in the way it pro­vides in­for­ma­tion about sex­ual mis­con­duct cases.</p>
    <p>The univer­sity sacked Dr Fer­nando af­ter it found that he had an “in­ti­mate as­so­ci­a­tion” with an un­der­grad­u­ate.</p>
    <p>Prof Koh said yes­ter­day at a me­dia brief­ing: “Go­ing for­ward, NUS will be more open, trans­par­ent, more will­ing to dis­sem­i­nate in­for­ma­tion in a timely man­ner.”</p>
    <p>He ac­knowl­edged that NUS, as a public in­sti­tu­tion, had not given timely up­dates on the case in­volv­ing the for­mer col­lege don.</p>
    <p>NUS first re­ceived a com­plaint about Dr Fer­nando on Aug 27. A se­cond com­plaint was made on Sept 7. It sacked him on Oct 7, and re­leased a public state­ment on Oct 18.</p>
    <p>Un­der­grad­u­ates have crit­i­cised the univer­sity for not be­ing more forth­com­ing about how it han­dled the case and not up­dat­ing the stu­dent pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“The univer­sity can learn from the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment in the way it had dealt with Sars (se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome) in 2003 and Covid-19 in 2020,” said Prof Koh, spell­ing out three cri­te­ria which he thought NUS did not meet.</p>
    <p>“The pol­icy is to be open rather than closed, to be trans­par­ent rather than opaque, to give timely in­for­ma­tion to your stake­hold­ers rather than to with­hold such in­for­ma­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“NUS has a rather con­ser­va­tive cul­ture and felt that when you dis­miss a staff (mem­ber), the HR prac­tice is that you don’t tell the world that some­body has been sacked.”</p>
    <p>But he noted that this prac­tice is ap­pli­ca­ble in the pri­vate sec­tor but not to a public in­sti­tu­tion like NUS.</p>
    <p>NUS’ dean of stu­dents and as­so­ci­ate provost (spe­cial projects) Leong Ching, who was also present at the brief­ing, said: “The cul­ture (at NUS) must change from one that is con­ser­va­tive and erring on the side of cau­tion to one that com­mits it­self to timely, ac­cu­rate, re­spect­ful com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“And in so do­ing, we must be able to tol­er­ate greater risks and take th­ese risks.”</p>
    <p>NUS will be more trans­par­ent in in­ter­nal com­mu­ni­ca­tions re­gard­ing sex­ual mis­con­duct, with­out com­pro­mis­ing the pri­vacy and wel­fare of vic­tims, As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Leong said.</p>
    <p>It will also “look at the speed of po­lice re­port­ing”, she said, adding that the univer­sity has a le­gal duty to in­form the po­lice of such cases.</p>
    <p>But the univer­sity also has to make judg­ment calls in “ex­cep­tional cir­cum­stances”.</p>
    <p>This means NUS may be more cau­tious and de­lay re­port­ing if there are cer­tain men­tal health risks, such as the pos­si­bil­ity of self­harm on the part of the com­plainants, she said.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, NUS said it has made a po­lice re­port against Dr Fer­nando. It added that its in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions found that Dr Fer­nando “had an in­ti­mate as­so­ci­a­tion” with an un­der­grad­u­ate – a se­ri­ous breach of its staff code of con­duct.</p>
    <p>This was ad­e­quate cause for sum­mary dis­missal, and sep­a­rate from the stu­dents’ al­le­ga­tions, Prof Leong said in ex­plain­ing Dr Fer­nando’s sack­ing.</p>
    <p>“As long as you have some in­ti­mate relations (with stu­dents), you have al­ready breached the staff code of con­duct,” she said.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Kelvin Pang, mas­ter of Tem­busu Col­lege, said that there are checks in place when hir­ing col­lege fel­lows, and urged stu­dents to raise mat­ters with NUS if they feel “mildly un­com­fort­able” in any sit­u­a­tion.</p>
