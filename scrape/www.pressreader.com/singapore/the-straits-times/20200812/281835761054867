    <p>Ja­pan’s top diplo­mat Toshim­itsu Motegi will ar­rive in Sin­ga­pore to­day for a three-day visit, be­com­ing the first high-rank­ing min­is­ter to make an of­fi­cial visit to the Re­pub­lic since bor­der re­stric­tions were put in place due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Motegi is sched­uled to pay a courtesy call on Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and hold talks with his Sin­ga­pore coun­ter­part Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs said in a state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s For­eign Min­istry, in its own state­ment, noted that a new Cabi­net was re­cently formed in Sin­ga­pore. Re­fer­ring to to­mor­row’s talks, it said: “Through this face-to­face meet­ing, we will strengthen bi­lat­eral re­la­tions and ex­change opin­ions on mea­sures against the coro­n­avirus as well as re­gional geopol­i­tics.”</p>
    <p>The talks will likely touch on the re­sump­tion of cross-bor­der travel be­tween the two coun­tries, as well as on China’s ris­ing as­sertive­ness in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s For­eign Min­istry in a state­ment last month de­scribed Sin­ga­pore and Ja­pan as strong eco­nomic part­ners.</p>
    <p>It said: “The es­tab­lish­ment of a re­cip­ro­cal green lane be­tween our coun­tries will be an im­por­tant and pos­i­tive step for­ward to­wards restor­ing con­nec­tiv­ity, and fa­cil­i­tat­ing es­sen­tial business and of­fi­cial travel with the nec­es­sary public health safe­guards.”</p>
    <p>Mr Motegi will visit Kuala Lumpur on Fri­day for talks with Malaysia’s Min­is­ter of In­ter­na­tional Trade and In­dus­try Azmin Ali and For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein, be­fore re­turn­ing to Tokyo on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese min­is­ter’s trip to Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia this week comes amid a flurry of diplo­matic ac­tiv­ity by Tokyo as it looks to ex­pand business op­por­tu­ni­ties and push for an eas­ing of bi­lat­eral bor­der con­trols.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, which is spear­head­ing a Free and Open Indo-Pa­cific vi­sion, has also in­creas­ingly been tak­ing a stronger tone against Beijing on such is­sues as its mil­i­tary ex­pan­sion­ism in both the East and South China seas, as well as on Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Mr Motegi be­came the first Ja­panese Cabi­net min­is­ter to travel abroad since Fe­bru­ary when he made a four-day visit to Lon­don last week to iron out the fine print of a new eco­nomic part­ner­ship agree­ment be­tween his coun­try and Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>He is also due to visit Pa­pua New Guinea, Cam­bo­dia, Laos and Myan­mar from Aug 20 to 25.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that Mr Motegi will have to take a Covid-19 test be­fore leav­ing and re­turn­ing to Ja­pan as a coun­ter­mea­sure against the disease.</p>
    <p>His entourage will be kept to the bare min­i­mum and he will travel by char­tered plane. The use of public trans­port in the des­ti­na­tion coun­tries will also be avoided.</p>
    <p>Upon his re­turn to Ja­pan, Mr Motegi will be ex­empted from the manda­tory two-week quar­an­tine pe­riod that all other trav­ellers are sub­ject to, so as not to in­ter­fere with his public du­ties.</p>
