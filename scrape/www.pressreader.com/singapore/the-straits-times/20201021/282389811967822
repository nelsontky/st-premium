    <p>De­fend­ing cham­pi­ons Brunei DPMM’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) re­mains in limbo, af­ter the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) an­nounced yes­ter­day that the match be­tween Hougang United and the Brunei side on Sun­day has been post­poned.</p>
    <p>The FAS did not pro­vide a new date for the resched­uled fix­ture.</p>
    <p>In its me­dia state­ment, the FAS said it had pro­posed to DPMM to be ac­com­mo­dated in Sin­ga­pore and to play their matches here. The gov­ern­ing foot­ball body “is still work­ing with the club for their travel and lo­gis­ti­cal ar­range­ments to Sin­ga­pore”.</p>
    <p>DPMM had missed the Oct 12 dead­line to con­firm their par­tic­i­pa­tion in the nine-team SPL that re­sumed last Satur­day af­ter a sev­en­month sus­pen­sion due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. They had re­ceived a bye in last week’s fix­ture.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the league could be thrown into up­heaval with a fix­ture pile-up should DPMM be un­able to play their games as sched­uled. The team had played just one game – a 2-0 win over Tampines Rovers on March 6 – be­fore the hia­tus on March 24, and have been pen­cilled in for an av­er­age of two games a week in the restart.</p>
    <p>But ri­val clubs such as Hougang do not mind the in­con­ve­nience, as the Chee­tahs’ coach Cle­ment Teo said that DPMM “bring qual­ity to the league”.</p>
    <p>Not want­ing to win the game by a walkover, he added: “There must be valid rea­sons for the de­lay. De­spite the post­pone­ment, we would be happy for DPMM to con­tinue play­ing... They are de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons and al­ways push us to the limit, so it would be a pity if they are un­able to par­tic­i­pate.</p>
    <p>“If we have to resched­ule this match, so that DPMM can con­tinue play­ing... we are happy to do so. Some­times, there have to be some sac­ri­fices made for the bet­ter­ment of the league. There will be ad­van­tages and dis­ad­van­tages with this post­pone­ment, and the pos­i­tive thing is that we have more time to pre­pare for our next match.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, DPMM coach Adrian Pen­nock told The Straits Times that the de­ci­sion to par­tic­i­pate in the SPL is not in the club’s hands and that they will re­spect the rules of the Brunei gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>He also said that his team have had stag­gered groups-of-10 train­ing ses­sions since the end of July, but never a full team train­ing since their only SPL game this sea­son.</p>
    <p>DPMM de­fender Char­lie Clough said: “I hope we get to play even­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>“Per­son­ally, I have worked hard dur­ing this long break and so I would like to think I’m ready to go. It would def­i­nitely be nice to de­fend our ti­tle.</p>
    <p>“That said, it has been a frus­trat­ing 2020 for ev­ery­one, not just us, and we un­der­stand health and safety have to come first.”</p>
    <p>Per­son­ally, I have worked hard dur­ing this long break and so I would like to think I’m ready to go. It would def­i­nitely be nice to de­fend our ti­tle.</p>
    <p>CHAR­LIE CLOUGH, DPMM de­fender, who can hardly wait for his team to get the nod.</p>
