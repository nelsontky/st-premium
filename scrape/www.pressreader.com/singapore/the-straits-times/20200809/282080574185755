    <p>WASHINGTON/BED­MIN­STER • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump vowed to uni­lat­er­ally sus­pend pay­roll taxes and ex­tend ex­pired coro­n­avirus un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits af­ter ne­go­ti­a­tions with con­gres­sional Democrats on a broad pan­demic aid pack­age col­lapsed on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump told a news con­fer­ence at his golf club in New Jersey that he will sign an ex­ec­u­tive or­der im­ple­ment­ing these mea­sures, sus­pend­ing stu­dent loan re­pay­ments and rental hous­ing evic­tions in the com­ing days if no deal is reached.</p>
    <p>He said the pay­roll tax sus­pen­sion – a move he has long called for but is shunned by both par­ties in Congress – would be retroac­tive to July 1 and ex­tend to the end of the year, with a pos­si­ble ex­ten­sion into next year if he is re-elected.</p>
    <p>He said the or­der could be signed by the end of the week, with­out spec­i­fy­ing whether he meant last week or this week. He said he ex­pected it to be chal­lenged in court.</p>
    <p>“If Democrats con­tinue to hold this crit­i­cal re­lief hostage, I will act un­der my au­thor­ity as pres­i­dent to get Amer­i­cans the re­lief they need,” he said at the brief­ing, which took on the look of a cam­paign event.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier on Fri­day in Washington, Mr Trump’s chief of staff, Mr Mark Mead­ows, and Trea­sury Sec­re­tary Steven Mnuchin said there was no progress in ne­go­ti­a­tions at the Capi­tol with the two top Democrats in Congress – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Se­nate Demo­cratic leader Chuck Schumer.</p>
    <p>The global pan­demic has taken a par­tic­u­larly heavy toll on the United States, where it has killed more than 160,000 peo­ple and thrown tens of mil­lions out of work.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump ini­tially played down the threat of the dis­ease and drew crit­i­cism for in­con­sis­tent mes­sages on pub­lic health mea­sures like mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Fri­day’s talks ap­peared to mark the end of nearly two weeks of al­most daily closed-door ne­go­ti­a­tions be­tween the four lead­ers, who have sought to ham­mer out an agree­ment on leg­is­la­tion to re­sume Covid-19 re­lief pro­grammes that ex­pired at the end of last month.</p>
    <p>Democrats said they of­fered to re­duce a pro­posed US$3.4 tril­lion (S$4.67 tril­lion) coro­n­avirus aid pack­age, which the House passed in May but the Se­nate ig­nored, by nearly one-third if Repub­li­cans would agree to more than dou­ble their US$1 tril­lion counter of­fer.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s ne­go­tia­tors turned them down.</p>
    <p>“It was a dis­ap­point­ing meet­ing,” Mr Schumer told re­porters.</p>
    <p>Both sides said they re­mained open to fur­ther ne­go­ti­a­tions. “I will be back here any time to lis­ten to new pro­pos­als,” said Mr Mnuchin, who iden­ti­fied the road­blocks as fund­ing for state and lo­cal gov­ern­ments and an ex­ten­sion of en­hanced un­em­ploy­ment pay­ments, a US$600 per week life­line for those who have lost jobs in the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mrs Pelosi said she gave him and Mr Mead­ows a stern part­ing mes­sage: “Come back when you’re ready to give us a higher num­ber.”</p>
    <p>It was un­clear how much any pres­i­dent could do by ex­ec­u­tive or­der.</p>
    <p>At his news con­fer­ence, Mr Schumer said the Pres­i­dent could not or­der any new money spent – as that is the power of Congress – but could only de­fer costs un­til they were even­tu­ally paid.</p>
    <p>The US Con­sti­tu­tion gives Congress au­thor­ity over fed­eral spend­ing, so Mr Trump does not have the le­gal au­thor­ity to is­sue ex­ec­u­tive or­ders de­ter­min­ing how money should be spent on the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has man­aged to side­step Congress on spend­ing be­fore. Last year, he de­clared a na­tional emer­gency on the US-Mexico bor­der to shift bil­lions of dol­lars from the de­fence bud­get to pay for a bor­der wall he promised dur­ing his 2016 elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Mr Schumer placed some of the blame for the lack of progress on 20 Repub­li­cans in the Se­nate greatly in­flu­enced by the con­ser­va­tive Tea Party: “They don’t want to spend the nec­es­sary dol­lars to help get Amer­ica out of this mess. Ide­ol­ogy sort of blinds them.”</p>
