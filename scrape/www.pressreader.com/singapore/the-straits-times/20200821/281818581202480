    <p>NEW YORK • Many New York­ers are avoid­ing the sub­way, fear­ful of jostling with strangers in crowded cars.</p>
    <p>Masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing are es­sen­tial, but good air­flow is also key to re­duc­ing the risk of ex­po­sure to the virus.</p>
    <p>The sub­way’s ven­ti­la­tion sys­tem moves air within train cars more ef­fi­ciently than restau­rants, schools and other in­door set­tings, ac­cord­ing to aerosol ex­perts. But it is not a guar­an­tee to pro­tect against the virus. Here is how the sys­tem works. At any given mo­ment, 75 per cent of the air a per­son breathes in a sub­way car is re­cy­cled. The rest is pulled in from out­side.</p>
    <p>Air is con­stantly sucked up through vents, cooled and fil­tered be­fore be­ing pushed back through ducts that span the ceil­ing.</p>
    <p>At the same time, out­side air is pulled into the sys­tem, com­bined with the ex­ist­ing mix and re­leased into the car through the duct pan­els, which span the ceil­ing.</p>
    <p>Con­tin­u­ous air­flow through the vents helps limit vi­ral par­ti­cles from build­ing up in­side a car and in­fect­ing peo­ple as they in­hale.</p>
    <p>Most sub­way cars have two ven­ti­la­tion units at ei­ther end, which help fully re­place air in the car with out­side air about ev­ery three min­utes and 20 sec­onds on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>In­side the units, fans pull the air through fil­ters and cool­ing coils. The fil­ters work to block large and small aerosols be­fore air en­ters the ducts.</p>
    <p>But the fil­ters do not catch ev­ery­thing – and some vi­ral par­ti­cles could slip past and get dis­persed into trains.</p>
    <p>The way the fil­ters work is de­ter­mined by their ma­te­ri­als and shape. The sub­way fil­ters have a wave de</p>
