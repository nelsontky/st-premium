    <p>Do not let the pan­demic get in the way of en­joy­ing pasar malam snacks like vadai.</p>
    <p>Get your fix of fried frit­ters at Ye­hYeh’s Cafe in Changi Road. The cafe, which opened in Oc­to­ber last year, sells vadai in many flavours, in­clud­ing veggie, chilli, sar­dine and plain.</p>
    <p>The Sig­na­ture Prawn Vadai and Ikan Bilis Vadai are the stars. The min­i­mum or­der is a box of five for $6.</p>
    <p>Ex­pect to wait as the vadai are in­di­vid­u­ally pre­pared and fried to or­der. Served in a banana leaf-lined bas­ket, they taste as ap­petis­ing as they look. Pip­ing hot with a golden crust, they are fluffy and moist on the in­side. Each one feels like a crisp savoury cloud.</p>
    <p>The best way to en­joy vadai is to al­ter­nate each bite with a nip of the raw green chilli that comes with it.</p>
    <p>For the prawn vadai, when­ever sup­ply is avail­able, the shop uses swa lor – a wild sea prawn that is crunchy in tex­ture and has pro­nounced seafood flavours, com­plete with a nat­u­ral salti­ness.</p>
    <p>When it is not avail­able, the shop uses farmed sea prawns for sweet­ness and crunch.</p>
    <p>The Sig­na­ture Prawn Vadai, crowned with a whole prawn, looks sump­tu­ous and out­shines the Ikan Bilis Vadai in ap­pear­ance, but the ikan bilis does not pale in taste.</p>
    <p>Ms Lo­geswaari Sam­raj Ah­sockan, 31, owner and di­rec­tor of Ye­hYeh’s Cafe, says the ikan bilis is painstak­ingly washed, soaked and peeled to re­move the head and tiny bones be­fore fry­ing.</p>
    <p>The re­sult of all that labour is ikan bilis that is lightly crisp with­out hard edges. It is not overly salty, and does not have the over­whelm­ing fishy odour found in those ver­sions that are not cleaned prop­erly be­fore cook­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Sam­raj Ah­sockan be­gan learn­ing how to make vadai at age 10 from her fa­ther, Mr Sam­raj Ah­sockan Muthiah, 60. He started sell­ing vadai in 1985 un­der the stall name Mr Vadai, which be­came well-known in the pasar malam cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>She has kept to her fa­ther’s recipe. All the vadai are made us­ing an aro­matic bat­ter that con­tains co­rian­der leaves, curry leaves, onion, chilli and spring onion.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, the shop launched a new flavour, Quail Egg Mini Vadai (10 for $4). For each mini vadai, half a quail egg is en­cased in bat­ter then fried into a ball.</p>
    <p>The cafe has seat­ing for up to six cus­tomers outdoors. It is best to or­der by phone for self-col­lec­tion or de­liv­ery. The de­liv­ery fee is $10 for most ar­eas, and $15 for lo­ca­tions in Bukit Pan­jang, Choa Chu Kang and Jurong.</p>
    <p>For take­away vadai, put them in an air­fryer to get them hot and crisp again. Con­sume them on the same day, or by the next day, if they last that long.</p>
