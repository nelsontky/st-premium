    <p>Many of Mum­bai’s of­fice work­ers and school­child­ren have had the priv­i­lege of en­joy­ing fresh home­cooked food de­liv­ered to them daily by a faith­ful net­work of “dabbawalas”. It is a prac­tice that is more than a cen­tury old.</p>
    <p>These work­ers – eas­ily iden­ti­fi­able by their trade­mark white uni­forms and white-coloured side caps, or “Gandhi caps” – are more than just a lunch box de­liv­ery sys­tem. The dabbawalas, or “ones with boxes”, are a tourist at­trac­tion and a cul­tural icon in Mum­bai, with vis­i­tors to the city queue­ing up to take self­ies with them.</p>
    <p>But the Covid-19 pan­demic has cast a shadow over them.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren have been study­ing on­line and most of the city’s of­fice work­ers have con­tin­ued to work from home since March.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the bi­cy­cles of the dabbawalas rust away at Mum­bai’s rail­way sta­tions.</p>
    <p>“If our cus­tomers are still at home and schools shut, who do we de­liver the dab­bas (lunch boxes) to?” said Mr Sub­hash Talekar, the pres­i­dent of the Mum­bai Dab­bawala As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>To cope with this cri­sis, many dabbawalas re­turned to their vil­lages to farm on their an­ces­tral land. Oth­ers have taken up different pro­fes­sions in the In­dian city and be­come watch­men, rick­shaw pullers or man­ual labour­ers.</p>
    <p>The truly un­lucky ones have yet to find a job, eight months since their work came to a stand­still.</p>
    <p>Mr Kailash Shinde, who has worked as a dab­bawala for 22 years, has been un­em­ployed since last April. His fam­ily has sur­vived mostly on his wife’s earn­ings as a do­mes­tic helper, and thanks to ma­te­rial as­sis­tance such as food ra­tions that he and other dabbawalas re­ceive from well-wish­ers in the city.</p>
    <p>“I am will­ing to take up one that pays me even 10,000 ru­pees (S$181), but I have yet to find a job,” said Mr Shinde, who earned about 5,000 ru­pees more than that every month as a dab­bawala.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic’s whiplash has now com­pelled the dabbawalas to think of sur­vival strate­gies.</p>
    <p>For the first time, last Novem­ber, the dabbawalas took to fer­ry­ing some­thing other than lunch boxes when the Mum­bai Tif­fin Box Sup­pli­ers As­so­ci­a­tion (MTBSA) be­gan de­liv­er­ing fresh pro­duce and gro­ceries.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause our cus­tomers cur­rently do not re­quire their dab­bas, we are sup­ply­ing them fruit, veg­eta­bles and gro­ceries that they need daily at their homes in­stead,” said Mr Vishnu Kal­doke, a spokesman for the MTBSA.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­i­sa­tion sources fresh pro­duce from farm­ers’ groups and sells it di­rectly to cus­tomers in Mum­bai at com­pet­i­tive prices.</p>
    <p>While there were more than 5,000 dabbawalas work­ing in the city and its sub­urbs be­fore the Covid-19 out­break, de­liv­er­ing 200,000 lunch boxes daily and re­turn­ing them to their homes, only about 450 are now en­gaged in the prac­tice. This new ar­range­ment to sell fresh pro­duce and gro­cery items has al­lowed another 500 to get back on the road.</p>
    <p>MTBSA hopes this rein­ven­tion will help re­tain work­ers in the net­work so that they can quickly switch back to de­liv­er­ing lunch boxes when nor­mal work re­sumes. It is also ex­pected to cush­ion the dabbawalas from any threat that may arise from a post­pan­demic work-from-home cul­ture.</p>
    <p>The ori­gin of the dabbawalas is traced to a Parsi banker who longed for fresh, home-cooked food at his of­fice and en­gaged the first such in­di­vid­ual to bring him his meals. The idea caught on quickly, and an en­tre­pre­neur­ial Ma­hadeo Havaji Bachche tapped this op­por­tu­nity to start a lunch de­liv­ery ser­vice with about 100 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>A sys­tem that be­gan with sim­ple colour cod­ing meant to be eas­ily un­der­stood by il­lit­er­ate dabbawalas has evolved over the years to re­flect its ex­panded cov­er­age. Be­sides colour, it now in­cor­po­rates num­bers and let­ters to in­di­cate the col­lec­tion point, the train to be taken, and the fi­nal des­ti­na­tion of the lunch box.</p>
    <p>All this in­for­ma­tion is marked on the lid of the lunch box, which can change hands as many as six times dur­ing its daily jour­ney and even travel more than 50km one way.</p>
    <p>Slip-ups are rare. A 2010 study by the Har­vard Busi­ness School found that dabbawalas make fewer than 3.4 mis­takes per mil­lion de­liv­er­ies, and ac­corded them a cov­eted “Six Sigma” rat­ing.</p>
    <p>The dabbawalas are now pray­ing the pan­demic re­cedes.</p>
    <p>“We feel that as long as a mother’s love re­mains for her son, a sis­ter’s love for her brother, a wife’s love for her hus­band, as long as the fam­ily struc­ture is re­tained in Mum­bai, food will be cooked at home and sent out,” said Mr Talekar.</p>
    <p>And un­til that changes, he added, dabbawalas will re­main at the ser­vice of Mum­baikars. “I am hope­ful. It is hope that sus­tains the world.”</p>
