    <p>WHERE Yi Hao Cof­fee Shop,</p>
    <p>01-30, Block 94 Toa Payoh Lorong 4 OPEN 11.30am to 10.30pm daily TEL 8711-5600</p>
    <p>The seats fill up quickly even on week­day evenings at this zi char joint, which at­tracts a reg­u­lar fol­low­ing who go early or make reser­va­tions.</p>
    <p>Chef Liang Hoong Boon, 44, who is from Malaysia, is co-owner and head chef. He started his zi char stall in 2008 in Kim Keat Av­enue. It moved to Toa Payoh Lorong 4 in 2018.</p>
    <p>The stand­out dish is Fra­grant Chicken (Zhao Pai Jin Xi­ang Ji, $8 for small, $12 for medium).</p>
    <p>Chef Liang uses chicken thigh, drum­stick and wing, which he cuts into bite-sized pieces and mar­i­nates overnight in hua tiao wine, soya sauce, sugar and egg. The chicken is coated in a bat­ter of corn flour and potato starch be­fore be­ing deep-fried.</p>
    <p>He then stir-fries the chicken in a Thai-in­spired sauce that con­tains sliv­ers of torch gin­ger bulb, chilli padi, crispy curry leaves and lime juice.</p>
    <p>The chicken is so skil­fully fried that it re­mains crispy to­wards the end of your meal.</p>
    <p>The Ce­real Bean­curd ($10 for small, $15 for medium) is deep­fried bean­curd pre­pared in-house daily with fresh soya milk and eggs. The mix­ture is fil­tered twice, re­sult­ing in an ex­cep­tion­ally smooth tex­ture. The bean­curd comes cov­ered in crispy ce­real.</p>
    <p>Do or­der the Fish Maw Soup ($10 for small, $20 for medium), made us­ing pre­mium fish maw that chef Liang pres­sure-cooks to springy ten­der­ness.</p>
    <p>For $10, you get a full bowl of soup that is packed with fish maw. The broth, sim­mered us­ing ikan bilis, soya beans, pork bones and tee poh (dried flat fish), is rich with</p>
    <p>meat and seafood flavours.</p>
    <p>If you are din­ing alone and want a one-dish meal, go for the Black Bean Sauce Beef With Bit­ter Gourd Rice ($5.50).</p>
    <p>For non-beef eaters, opt for chicken or fish at $5 a plate. The bit­ter­gourd is blanched in oil and soaked in chilled water be­fore cook­ing to rid it of bit­ter­ness.</p>
