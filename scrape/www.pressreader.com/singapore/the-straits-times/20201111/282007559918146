    <p>I sup­port Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s call to “keep up the vir­tu­ous cir­cle of good gov­er­nance that re­sults in po­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity and en­ables long-term plan­ning”</p>
    <p>(Keep cy­cle of good gov­er­nance and sta­bil­ity go­ing: PM, Nov 9).</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has posed an ex­tra­or­di­nary threat to the na­tion’s pub­lic health and eco­nomic pros­per­ity. It has also driven govern­ments across the globe to op­er­ate in a con­text of rad­i­cal un­cer­tainty, and they face dif­fi­cult trade-offs given the pub­lic health, eco­nomic and so­cial chal­lenges the pan­demic raises.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, too, faces tough de­ci­sions about which ap­pro­pri­ate mea­sures to im­ple­ment to­wards mit­i­gat­ing the trans­mis­sion of the virus in the com­mu­nity, what re­stric­tions to im­pose and when to loosen them, where our na­tion’s lim­ited fi­nan­cial re­sources will go and if na­tional con­cerns will be af­fected by global co­op­er­a­tion to com­bat the pan­demic, where the de­ployed re­sources, if any, could be ef­fec­tively used do­mes­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic re­lief pack­ages pre­sented in the four bud­gets that tar­get em­ploy­ment pro­tec­tion for cit­i­zens, and the var­i­ous mea­sures to pro­tect the wel­fare of mi­grant work­ers, are the right moves. This is be­cause as the econ­omy gets back to full pro­duc­tion, Sin­ga­pore will be able to re­bound faster.</p>
    <p>The other as­pect of gov­er­nance is for the Gov­ern­ment to have re­silience-build­ing cri­te­ria when al­lo­cat­ing pub­lic in­vest­ment fund­ing. This will en­sure that all lev­els of the gov­ern­ment treat all cit­i­zens and busi­nesses in the same way. At the same time, I recog­nise that it is cru­cial to fo­cus on sup­port­ing the in­dus­try seg­ments crit­i­cal to Sin­ga­pore’s sus­tained eco­nomic re­cov­ery, with the con­tin­ued fi­nan­cial sup­port to op­er­a­tionally vi­able small and medium-sized en­ter­prises and the self-em­ployed.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, the Gov­ern­ment must con­tinue to demon­strate its po­lit­i­cal will and com­pe­tence in re­spond­ing to the cri­sis. The me­dia must be an ob­jec­tive ar­biter of the facts. Busi­nesses can pro­vide the nec­es­sary prod­ucts and re­li­able in­for­ma­tion. Non-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions must part­ner the Gov­ern­ment in en­sur­ing a fair dis­tri­bu­tion of the vac­cine once it is avail­able in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This is the time for in­sti­tu­tions to work to­gether, lay­ing the ground­work for a united Sin­ga­pore and trust-based gov­er­nance led by the Gov­ern­ment in the era of the post-pan­demic new nor­mal.</p>
