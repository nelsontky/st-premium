    <p>SIT will en­able more in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary teach­ing by re­or­gan­is­ing its aca­demic struc­ture so that de­gree pro­grammes can draw teach­ing re­sources from var­i­ous clus­ters. It is also in­tro­duc­ing more mi­cro-mod­ules out­side stu­dents’ core cur­ric­ula in ar­eas such as gen­eral knowl­edge and work­place skills. These in­clude top­ics like in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty, un­der­stand­ing fi­nan­cial state­ments, ca­reer man­age­ment and in­ter­per­sonal skills.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy (SIT) is shak­ing up its cur­ric­ula to en­sure its stu­dents are bet­ter pre­pared for dis­rup­tions in the work­force.</p>
    <p>It is in­fus­ing about 15 per cent to 20 per cent of its de­gree pro­grammes with con­tent that cuts across dis­ci­plines, start­ing with fields like ac­coun­tancy, me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing and oc­cu­pa­tional ther­apy.</p>
    <p>The changes, which could take the form of cour­ses or in­dus­try projects to help stu­dents see be­yond their own spe­cial­i­sa­tions, will start from the next aca­demic year in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>SIT provost Chua Kee Chaing told The Straits Times that it is tak­ing the next two to three years to re­view cur­ric­ula to fac­tor in changes in in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Chua, who is also deputy pres­i­dent (aca­demic) and is head­ing the re­view, said there will be a greater em­pha­sis on in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary learn­ing, be­gin­ning with the univer­sity’s own 17 bach­e­lor’s de­gree pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>SIT has a fur­ther 17 joint de­grees and four oth­ers of­fered by overseas univer­sity part­ners.</p>
    <p>Prof Chua said: “We think that it is very use­ful be­fore (stu­dents) go off to work, to give them some ground­ing in terms of dis­ci­plines that are ad­ja­cent to their main dis­ci­plines.”</p>
    <p>The aim is that while each grad­u­ate be­comes a pro­fes­sional in a par­tic­u­lar sec­tor, he or she will also have enough knowl­edge in com­ple­men­tary fields to pick up more skills later if needed, he added.</p>
    <p>SIT will im­ple­ment this in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary push in a more tar­geted way, rather than open up a bas­ket of gen­eral mod­ules that stu­dents can choose – a prac­tice adopted by larger uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>Cour­ses and projects will be cus­tomised for each de­gree pro­gramme so they stay rel­e­vant to the main pro­fes­sion that stu­dents are train­ing for. This will be done by tak­ing a deep look at each de­gree pro­gramme and track­ing trends in dif­fer­ent sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Prof Chua cited new tech­nolo­gies like ma­chine learn­ing and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence in ac­coun­tancy. Health­care pro­fes­sion­als also need to have some knowl­edge of as­sis­tive robotics, which plays a key role in the care of el­derly pa­tients, he said.</p>
    <p>This means that stu­dents could be taught by lec­tur­ers from dif­fer­ent dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>SIT will en­able more in­ter­dis­ci­pli­nary teach­ing by re­or­gan­is­ing its aca­demic struc­ture so that de­gree pro­grammes can draw teach­ing re­sources from var­i­ous clus­ters if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>The fac­ulty be­long to five main clus­ters: en­gi­neer­ing; chem­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing and food tech­nol­ogy; in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy; health and so­cial sciences; and de­sign and spe­cialised busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The ac­coun­tancy pro­gramme, for ex­am­ple, is taught pri­mar­ily by fac­ulty from the de­sign and spe­cialised busi­nesses clus­ter, but it now also taps fac­ulty from in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy to teach cour­ses such as busi­ness an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>Two other en­gi­neer­ing de­grees al­ready strad­dle the en­gi­neer­ing and in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy clus­ters, while the rest of the pro­grammes are be­ing re­viewed.</p>
    <p>SIT is also in­tro­duc­ing more mi­cro-mod­ules out­side stu­dents’ core cur­ric­ula in ar­eas such as gen­eral knowl­edge and work­place skills. These in­clude top­ics like in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty, un­der­stand­ing fi­nan­cial state­ments, ca­reer man­age­ment and in­ter­per­sonal skills.</p>
    <p>Some of these mod­ules will be com­pul­sory and credit-bear­ing, said Prof Chua. SIT also plans to of­fer these mod­ules to alumni and the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Over time, the univer­sity hopes to change at­ti­tudes to­wards learn­ing, noted Prof Chua, so that pro­fes­sors do not over-teach con­tent that could quickly be­come out­dated, while al­low­ing stu­dents to step out of their com­fort zones.</p>
    <p>“It is that in­er­tia, fear that you need to over­come... (and) be­ing com­fort­able to learn some­thing be­yond what you’re com­fort­able with,” he added.</p>
