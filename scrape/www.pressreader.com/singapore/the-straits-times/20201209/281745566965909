    <p>The Malaysian gov­ern­ment has sought to al­lay con­cerns over a po­ten­tial dis­rup­tion to the pro­duc­tion of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vac­cine, say­ing it would look at other vac­cine can­di­dates to en­sure a sup­ply for Malaysians if needed.</p>
    <p>Pakatan Hara­pan MP Fahmi Fadzil asked in Par­lia­ment on Mon­day if the sup­ply of Covid-19 vac­cines to Malaysia would be af­fected, fol­low­ing a Reuters re­port that the US drug­maker an­tic­i­pates pro­duc­ing 50 mil­lion doses this year, down from an ear­lier tar­get of 100 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>He also queried the gov­ern­ment’s prepa­ra­tions to re­ceive the vac­cines and the ad­di­tional costs in­volved in the lo­gis­tics on top of the RM3 bil­lion (S$986 mil­lion) al­lo­ca­tion an­nounced.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and In­no­va­tion Min­is­ter Khairy Ja­malud­din said: “I am aware of the sup­ply is­sues, but the same me­dia re­port also stated that the prob­lem would af­fect only the 2020 sup­ply. As far as I know, it does not af­fect the sup­ply for the Malaysian gov­ern­ment next year.”</p>
    <p>Should there be a dis­rup­tion in the sup­ply chain, Mr Khairy said the gov­ern­ment would iden­tify other can­di­dates to en­sure there is suf­fi­cient sup­ply for Malaysians.</p>
    <p>Reuters last Fri­day re­ported that Pfizer has been forced to slash its pro­duc­tion tar­gets for its Covid-19 vac­cine be­cause of a lack of raw ma­te­ri­als for its sup­ply chain, spark­ing con­cerns of short­age.</p>
    <p>Malaysia inked a deal with Pfizer on Nov 24 to pro­cure 12.8 mil­lion doses of its vac­cine, enough to cover 20 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion. It also inked a deal with Co­vax to pro­cure vac­cines through the al­liance to cover 10 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Co­vax is an al­liance of coun­tries pool­ing their re­sources to en­sure the eq­ui­table global dis­tri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is ex­pected to re­ceive its first batch of Covid-19 vac­cines to im­mu­nise 6.4 mil­lion peo­ple as early as next month.</p>
    <p>Un­der Bud­get 2021, the</p>
    <p>Malaysian gov­ern­ment is al­lo­cat­ing RM3 bil­lion specif­i­cally for the Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Mr Khairy also re­futed a state­ment at­trib­uted to Umno MP Tengku Raza­leigh Hamzah that the gov­ern­ment had ex­hausted the en­tire al­lo­ca­tion to buy Covid-19 vac­cines from Pfizer.</p>
    <p>The al­lo­ca­tion, Mr Khairy said, is for pro­cure­ment, stor­age and trans­port for vac­ci­nat­ing 70 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion with coro­n­avirus vac­cines, and is not just for Pfizer’s vac­cine alone.</p>
    <p>“I can cat­e­gor­i­cally state in the House to­day that those claims are base­less and not true at all. I can­not dis­close the ac­tual price of the pro­cure­ment with Pfizer due to the NDA (non-dis­clo­sure agree­ment). But our agree­ment with Pfizer and also with Co­vax is still way within our reach of the RM3 bil­lion for 70 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion,” Mr Khairy said.</p>
    <p>He added that the fi­nal costs of the vac­cines for the coun­try were still un­der dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary data on an on­go­ing clin­i­cal trial shows that Pfizer’s vac­cine has a more than 90 per cent ef­fi­cacy rate. How­ever, the need to store it at mi­nus 70 deg C puts it out of reach for about two-thirds of the world’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal dis­trib­u­tors have limited ca­pac­ity to han­dle such a re­quire­ment in large quan­ti­ties, prompt­ing Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party law­maker Kelvin Yii from Sarawak state to ques­tion how the vac­cine would get to peo­ple in ru­ral ar­eas.</p>
    <p>This, how­ever, was not ad­dressed due to time con­straints.</p>
