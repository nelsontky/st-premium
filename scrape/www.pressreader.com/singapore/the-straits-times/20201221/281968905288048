    <p>The pan­demic showed if noth­ing else that no one is safe un­less ev­ery­body is, no mat­ter who you are, what job you do and how much wealth you pos­sess. Be­cause ev­ery­one mat­ters, you have to make sure all are taken care of and that the poor­est and most vul­ner­a­ble have a de­cent stan­dard of liv­ing and ac­cess to ba­sic needs such as health­care and ed­u­ca­tion. That’s what nar­row­ing the in­come and wealth gap is about. The old nor­mal did not un­der­stand this and did a poor job of tack­ling it. Do we re­ally want to get back to it in a hurry?</p>
    <p>There will never be an­other year like 2020, not in my life­time any­way.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic was a life-chang­ing event that ranked among the most dis­rup­tive in modern his­tory.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing changed overnight – the way we lived, worked and played. Cities ground to a halt, air­planes stopped fly­ing, bor­ders were closed, face masks be­came manda­tory and more than</p>
    <p>1.6 mil­lion peo­ple died from the in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>It is not over yet and the worst may still visit us. But now that sev­eral vac­cines have proved to be ef­fec­tive against the virus, there is fi­nally rea­son to hope that the re­cov­ery back to nor­malcy can fi­nally be­gin. Nor­mal has never looked so wanted and invit­ing.</p>
    <p>But though much has changed, I am not sure enough thought has been given to what it is that we want to go back to.</p>
    <p>In the head­long rush to get back to the new nor­mal, or what­ever you call it, we are in dan­ger of ig­nor­ing the most im­por­tant ques­tion, which is where ex­actly we want to head back to.</p>
    <p>If you think about it, all the ef­fort so far has been to try to recre­ate what was be­fore. We meet over Zoom to re­claim our work­ing life, so that we can con­tinue to work on the very same thing. Travel bub­bles hope to get us back to trav­el­ling like be­fore, when go­ing to Bangkok or Hong Kong was just an­other week­end trip.</p>
    <p>Even in sports, it does not mat­ter if foot­ball is played in empty sta­di­ums as long as the matches can be beamed into liv­ing rooms around the world, like it used to be.</p>
    <p>Then there is the race to de­velop a vac­cine, put it in pro­duc­tion and set up the lo­gis­tics to im­mu­nise mil­lions of peo­ple in as short a time as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>It has re­quired enor­mous ef­fort by sci­en­tists, drug com­pa­nies and gov­ern­ments work­ing at un­prece­dented speed, demon­strat­ing how much can be achieved when peo­ple put their minds and ca­pa­bil­i­ties to­gether to­wards a com­mon goal.</p>
    <p>In the next few months and pos­si­bly over much of next year, all the news and fo­cus will be on how to get vac­ci­nated, who will get it first and how to move back to nor­mal when enough peo­ple are fi­nally im­mu­nised.</p>
    <p>FULL SPEED AHEAD ON AU­TOPI­LOT</p>
    <p>Once the vac­ci­na­tion ma­chin­ery gets go­ing, you can be sure we will be on au­topi­lot to get back to where we were be­fore, and at full speed.</p>
    <p>Will there be time to think and re­flect on why nor­mal may not be good enough?</p>
    <p>In the early days of the pan­demic, there were calls to make use of the forced lock­down to hit the pause but­ton, take a good hard look at what we were do­ing that might have caused the pan­demic or which it had in­ad­ver­tently ex­posed. The is­sues in­cluded cli­mate change, ac­cess to pub­lic health, the dis­rup­tions cre­ated by un­think­ing glob­al­i­sa­tion, and the prob­lem of in­equal­ity with the poor and vul­ner­a­ble be­ing the most likely to die of the disease.</p>
    <p>The hope was that these is­sues would be dealt with and not for­got­ten once the dan­ger had passed. I fear it will not hap­pen as the de­sire to get back to nor­mal quickly over­rides ev­ery­thing else.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic wore on, fa­tigue set in. That is why it has been so hard in places such as in Europe and the United States to keep up the vig­i­lance nec­es­sary to con­trol the spread of the virus. They are now see­ing an­other wave of surg­ing in­fec­tions, and pos­si­bly an­other round of lock­down. Who can blame them for want­ing to get back to nor­mal as soon as pos­si­ble?</p>
    <p>UN­RE­SOLVED PROB­LEMS</p>
    <p>But nor­mal had many prob­lem­atic is­sues, and some of them re­quire ur­gent ac­tion, such as cli­mate change. It was re­ported re­cently that a new Bri­tish study on how the lock­down has slowed down global warm­ing wasn’t that heart-warm­ing. Though there were sig­nif­i­cant re­duc­tions in green­house gases and pol­lu­tants from the sharp fall in air and ur­ban travel, sci­en­tists have cal­cu­lated that the long-term im­pact is in­signif­i­cant – low­er­ing global tem­per­a­tures by only 0.01 deg C by 2030.</p>
    <p>It shows how much more needs to be done to make a real dif­fer­ence. This in­cludes not just re­duc­ing the use of fos­sil fuel but also de­vel­op­ing greener and more sus­tain­able en­ergy sources and us­ing them to power newer tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>It is the same with tack­ling so­ci­ety’s in­equal­ity. The pan­demic showed if noth­ing else that no one is safe un­less ev­ery­body is, no mat­ter who you are, what job you do and how much wealth you pos­sess. Be­cause ev­ery­one mat­ters, you have to make sure all are taken care of and that the poor­est and most vul­ner­a­ble have a de­cent stan­dard of liv­ing and ac­cess to ba­sic needs such as health­care and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>That’s what nar­row­ing the in­come and wealth gap is about. The old nor­mal did not un­der­stand this and did a poor job of tack­ling it. Do we re­ally want to get back to it in a hurry?</p>
