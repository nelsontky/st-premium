    <p>Pop­u­lar high-end res­tau­rants like the four-month-old Nishikane in Stan­ley Street are now fully booked for din­ner till next Fe­bru­ary. And if you are think­ing of din­ing at an­other Ja­panese restau­rant, Sushi Kou at the Hol­i­day Inn Sin­ga­pore Or­chard City Cen­tre, the next avail­able seat is in mid-March.</p>
    <p>A Sun­day Times check with more than 10 re­cently opened res­tau­rants shows that their wait lists are cur­rently up to next year.</p>
    <p>At some, only a smat­ter­ing of seats are avail­able for 5.30 or 9pm seat­ings on week­days.</p>
    <p>Five-star hotels, pop­u­lar for Christ­mas Eve din­ners and Christ­mas Day brunches, also re­port that their res­tau­rants are full-house or fill­ing fast for the fes­tive hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>It would seem that fine din­ing has bounced back, es­pe­cially for new open­ings, as a re­sult of sev­eral fac­tors.</p>
    <p>With closed bor­ders and leisure travel cur­tailed be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic, this year is see­ing an un­prece­dented num­ber of res­i­dents in town, at a time when many tra­di­tion­ally go away on hol­i­day.</p>
    <p>Some are spend­ing part of their usual va­ca­tion bud­gets on fancy meals in­stead, es­pe­cially at Ja­panese res­tau­rants, to make up for not be­ing able to travel to Ja­pan, a pop­u­lar desti­na­tion for food­ies here.</p>
    <p>At the 13-seat Sushi Kou, where the av­er­age spend­ing is $500 a per­son with­out al­co­hol, there is a wait list of 150 peo­ple hop­ing to snag a seat be­fore March. The restau­rant opened in June.</p>
    <p>The 19-seat kappo restau­rant Esora in Mo­hamed Sul­tan Road, which re­opened in July after shut­ter­ing last year, is full till Fe­bru­ary. Its omakase menu starts at $338.</p>
    <p>Some new res­tau­rants are be­ing propped up by sup­port from longtime faith­ful fans.</p>
    <p>Among them is chef Ja­son Tan, for­merly from the one-Miche­lin­starred Cor­ner House. His mod­ern Western restau­rant Eu­pho­ria opened in Tras Street on Nov 3 and has been full from day one.</p>
    <p>The 26-seat restau­rant takes reser­va­tions 30 days ahead, with the book­ing sys­tem re­freshed at mid­night daily. It has a long wait list of hope­ful din­ers for its menus which start at $208 a head.</p>
    <p>Tan says: “I am for­tu­nate to have a group of loyal friends and din­ers who has sup­ported me over the years.”</p>
    <p>At the 15-seat Fleurette, which opened last month in Ran­goon Road, the rest of the year is al­ready spo­ken for.</p>
    <p>Din­ers hop­ing to have a taste of Sin­ga­porean chef Tariq Helou’s $218 menu, based on his Ja­panese, Chi­nese and Le­banese her­itage, will have to wait till the be­gin­ning of next month for Jan­uary and Fe­bru­ary reser­va­tions to open.</p>
    <p>It does not have a wait list, but an­nounces last-minute can­cel­la­tions on In­sta­gram, as it has seen a fair num­ber of can­cel­la­tions and noshows.</p>
    <p>Co-owner Ai­dan Wee says: “Many make a book­ing first, then try to find com­pan­ions. If they are un­able to do so, they can­cel or sim­ply don’t turn up, claim­ing they for­got they had a reser­va­tion when we call them.</p>
    <p>“We also think some make mul­ti­ple book­ings across res­tau­rants and pick one on the day it­self.”</p>
    <p>To de­ter such cul­prits, the restau­rant now asks for a credit card de­posit, some­thing that a grow­ing num­ber of fine-din­ing res­tau­rants like Eu­pho­ria and Esora also do.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, those plan­ning to have their Christ­mas feasts in hotels have to act fast.</p>
    <p>The Re­gent Sin­ga­pore’s Ital­ian restau­rant Basil­ico sold out its Christ­mas Eve din­ner and Christ­mas Day brunch two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>At The Ritz-Carl­ton, Mil­lenia Sin­ga­pore, all-day eatery Colony is full for Christ­mas Eve lunch, Christ­mas Day brunch and Boxing Day brunch. Only limited seats are avail­able for Christ­mas Eve din­ner.</p>
    <p>Its Can­tonese restau­rant Sum­mer Pavil­ion is also full for Christ­mas Day lunch.</p>
    <p>Butcher’s Block at Raf­fles Sin­ga­pore has been fully booked for Dec 24 and 25 for a few weeks now. An­other of the ho­tel’s fine-din­ing res­tau­rants, La Dame de Pic, is al­most full.</p>
    <p>The Capi­tol Kempin­ski Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore’s 15 Stam­ford by Alvin Leung is also full on Christ­mas Day, with limited seats for Christ­mas Eve din­ner.</p>
    <p>But hope beck­ons at Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore, which has just opened reser­va­tions for its Triple Three restau­rant.</p>
    <p>Book­ings are com­ing in thick and fast though.</p>
