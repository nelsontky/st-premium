    <p>For two weeks now, thou­sands of In­done­sians have been cel­e­brat­ing the re­turn from Saudi Ara­bia of cleric Rizieq Shi­hab. This fol­lows a hero’s wel­come the founder of the Front Pem­bela Is­lam (FPI), or Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front, re­ceived at Jakarta In­ter­na­tional Air­port on Nov 10. Once on the mar­gins of In­done­sian pol­i­tics, the FPI, which claims a mem­ber­ship of five mil­lion, moved ever closer to the main­stream with its suc­cess in mo­bil­is­ing the 2106-2017 mass protests that led to the ouster of Jakarta gov­er­nor Ba­suki Tja­haja Pur­nama, who is of Chi­nese de­scent and a Chris­tian, on charges of blas­phem­ing Is­lam. The move­ment ef­fec­tively ended the po­lit­i­cal career of Mr Ba­suki, pop­u­larly known as Ahok. Hav­ing tasted suc­cess, Mr Rizieq and his move­ment have sought to widen their role. Al­though he fled In­done­sia in 2017 af­ter an al­leged sex scan­dal – charges were brought against him un­der the anti-pornog­ra­phy law that he cham­pi­oned – his pop­u­lar­ity is undimmed. Last week, posters in Jakarta held up by his traf­fic jam-in­duc­ing sup­port­ers de­picted him as a “grand imam”. He has called for a “moral rev­o­lu­tion”, say­ing there is a need to erad­i­cate in­jus­tice and cor­rup­tion in the coun­try. At 55, he is in the prime of his life and has po­lit­i­cal in­flu­ence. De­fence Min­is­ter Prabowo Su­bianto’s un­suc­cess­ful pres­i­den­tial bid last year had ex­plicit FPI back­ing and he re­mains a likely con­tender in 2024, when Mr Joko</p>
    <p>Wi­dodo’s con­sti­tu­tion­ally lim­ited two terms run out. An­other pos­si­ble pres­i­den­tial con­tender, Jakarta Gov­er­nor Anies Baswedan, met Mr Rizieq shortly af­ter the lat­ter’s re­turn from Saudi Ara­bia. The ques­tion that trou­bles ad­vo­cates of plu­ral­ism in In­done­sia and which will be of in­ter­est to ob­servers in the re­gion is whether Mr Rizieq now eyes po­lit­i­cal power for him­self or will he play a king­maker’s role.</p>
    <p>The strength of his ap­peal and the FPI’s or­gan­i­sa­tional struc­ture make both a po­tent force in In­done­sian pol­i­tics. While Pres­i­dent Joko has made clear his op­po­si­tion to groups that threaten In­done­sia’s plu­ral­ism and prac­tice of mod­er­ate Is­lam, Mr Rizieq and his move­ment con­tinue to cham­pion the case that syariah law be made of­fi­cial in the coun­try and the re­lease of jailed cler­ics, in­clud­ing Je­maah Is­lamiah founder Abu Bakar Bashir, among oth­ers. The health and eco­nomic fall­out from the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has also pro­vided fer­tile ground for them to ex­ploit. FPIlinked chat groups re­veal com­plaints about ris­ing cor­rup­tion in the gov­ern­ment, and also re­sent­ment against Chi­nese busi­nesses and blue-col­lar work­ers in In­done­sia, which is deeply trou­bling. Much there­fore turns on how Mr Joko and his gov­ern­ment re­spond to check those who stoke di­vi­sions in In­done­sia’s mul­ti­cul­tural so­ci­ety and seek to ex­ploit the coun­try’s eco­nomic chal­lenges, which the pan­demic has in­ten­si­fied.</p>
