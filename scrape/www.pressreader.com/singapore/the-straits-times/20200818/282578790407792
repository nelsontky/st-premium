    <p>CON­CERT</p>
    <p>SSO NA­TIONAL DAY CON­CERT: A NA­TION IN HAR­MONY</p>
    <p>Over the l ast three years, the Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Or­ches­tra’s (SSO) Na­tional Day Con­certs have be­come proud show­cases of works by Sin­ga­porean and lo­cally based com­posers.</p>
    <p>This year’s of­fer­ings, con­ducted by Dar­rell Ang, in­cluded four new works. Three were by young com­posers who, by their ages, would be known as mil­len­ni­als. Never in Sin­ga­pore’s 55-year his­tory has there been such a glut of com­pos­ing tal­ent.</p>
    <p>The con­cert be­gan with New Begin­nings by San­dra Lim (born 1991), a slickly or­ches­trated fan­tasy riff­ing on two pop­u­lar songs, Di Tan­jong Ka­tong and Sin­ga­pura. Re­sem­bling the scores of Hol­ly­wood epics a la John Wil­liams, the mo­tifs of both songs were wit­tily bandied about, but never heard in full.</p>
    <p>Per so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­quire­ments, the or­ches­tra was cham­ber­sized, with mu­si­cians widely sep­a­rated on the Es­planade Con­cert Hall stage and all masked up (wind play­ers ex­cepted) – which is, for now, stan­dard con­cert attire.</p>
    <p>More mod­ern and omi­nous in feel was Metro by Tan Yut­ing (born 1993), a por­trayal of ur­ban hy­per­ac­tiv­ity – per­haps not of Sin­ga­pore’s pris­tine streets, but some­where far less se­cure or savoury.</p>
    <p>Over an os­ti­nato beat es­tab­lished by Jonathan Fox on hi-hat cym­bals, a quasi-min­i­mal­ist scenario un­folded with Stravin­skyan econ­omy, but al­ways poised on a ra­zor’s edge, as if violence might erupt at any mo­ment. This seemed a por­tent of the un­cer­tain times peo­ple live in.</p>
    <p>“Ex­u­ber­ant” would aptly de­scribe City Aris­ing by Jonathan Shin (born in 1992), a bustling morn­ing scene of the na­tion wak­ing to an­other fraught and fre­netic day.</p>
    <p>Even the ear-pierc­ing call of the koel was quoted, heard on Ma Yue’s solo clar­inet, and the en­su­ing hub­bub was a good-na­tured and com­i­cally op­ti­mistic one, re­call­ing so­cial­ist-re­al­ist over­tures of Shostakovi­ch and Ka­balevsky.</p>
    <p>The Texan John Sharp­ley (born 1955), res­i­dent here since the mid-1980s, was the sole boomer among young up­starts. His chamber opera Kan­nagi (2009), based on the Tamil saga Si­la­p­athikaram (The An­klet), has now be­come part of the Sin­ga­pore opera canon.</p>
    <p>Brah­man: Kan­nagi’s Re­al­i­sa­tion, the penul­ti­mate sec­tion of the opera, was a se­quence build­ing up to a grand cli­max.</p>
    <p>An­tic­i­pa­tion and ex­pectancy were driven to seem­ingly in­sur­mount­able lev­els, height­ened by Shane Thio’s runs on the ce­lesta.</p>
    <p>This in­tox­i­cat­ing mu­sic ac­com­pa­nied bharatanat­yam dancer Kshirja Govind’s en­tranc­ing move­ments play­ing the epony­mous hero­ine­turned-god­dess.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the se­ri­ous stuff, Dick Lee’s Home (or­ches­trated by Kelly Tang) pro­vided some lev­ity in a video from the 2018 Na­tional Day Con­cert fea­tur­ing the Sin­ga­pore Sym­phony Cho­ruses.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Day Pa­rade favourite Count On Me, Sin­ga­pore by Canadian Hugh Har­ri­son (whose other hit song was Stand Up For Sin­ga­pore) was sung jazz-style by Ben­jamin Kheng in a slick, com­mer­cially pro­duced video that also re­counted land­marks in SSO’s his­tory.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, it was left to Zu­bir Said’s na­tional an­them Ma­ju­lah Sin­ga­pura (in Tang’s 2020 re­orches­tra­tion for chamber forces) to do the hon­ours.</p>
    <p>So, what is Sin­ga­pore mu­sic? A fuller pic­ture emerges with each and ev­ery Na­tional Day con­cert, so long may this con­tinue.</p>
