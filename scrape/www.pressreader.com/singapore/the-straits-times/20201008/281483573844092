    <p>US-based biotech com­pany Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics, which is de­vel­op­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine with the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School here, is look­ing at a lyophilise­d or freezedrie­d ver­sion of its mRNA vac­cine to get around cold chain chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>It will be test­ing it in up­com­ing tri­als. If suc­cess­ful, the prod­uct will re­move the need to have spe­cial ul­tra-cold freez­ers, which are costly and not com­mon and make it chal­leng­ing to de­ploy the vac­cine. The phase 1/2 tri­als for the can­di­date vac­cine are be­ing con­ducted here.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases will start en­rolling Covid-19 pa­tients for a large global trial to test mon­o­clonal an­ti­body treat­ments for the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine could well be one which can be man­u­fac­tured, shipped and stored with ease, as the com­pany be­hind it is work­ing on a ver­sion which does not need ul­tra-cold con­di­tions for it to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>Arc­turus Ther­a­peu­tics, a USbased biotech­nol­ogy com­pany de­vel­op­ing a Covid-19 vac­cine with the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School here, is look­ing at a lyophilise­d or freeze-dried ver­sion of its mRNA vac­cine that could work well at room tem­per­a­ture, un­like other sim­i­lar vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Its pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive Joseph Payne said: “We in­tend to in­ves­ti­gate a lyophilise­d vac­cine prod­uct in our larger clin­i­cal tri­als.</p>
    <p>“By hav­ing a lyophilise­d vac­cine prod­uct and re­mov­ing the wa­ter (in the prod­uct), it means that shelf life could be im­proved greatly and han­dling is much less com­pli­cated (as) it would not re­quire mi­nus 60to 80-centi­grade freez­ers or dry ice han­dling.”</p>
    <p>In a re­cent Zoom in­ter­view, Mr Payne told The Straits Times that they are eval­u­at­ing the sta­bil­ity of their vac­cine at var­i­ous tem­per­a­tures, in­clud­ing at mi­nus 20 deg C, 4 to 8 deg C, and room tem­per­a­ture.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a suc­cess­ful lyophilise­d prod­uct, which is a pow­dered ver­sion that needs to be re­con­sti­tuted on site, re­moves the need for spe­cial ul­tra-cold freez­ers, which are costly and not com­mon, he said.</p>
    <p>The cold chain chal­lenges of de­ploy­ing cer­tain Covid-19 vac­cines have been in the news re­cently as the spot­light is in­creas­ingly placed on the enor­mous task of man­u­fac­tur­ing and de­ploy­ing a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>With devel­op­ers rac­ing ahead with their tri­als, it is look­ing more likely that a Covid-19 vac­cine will emerge soon.</p>
    <p>World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus said this week there is hope that there will be a Covid-19 vac­cine by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Forty-two Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates are cur­rently in clin­i­cal tri­als, of which 10 are in large-scale, phase three tri­als, ac­cord­ing to the WHO.</p>
    <p>An­other 151 vac­cine can­di­dates are in the pre-clin­i­cal stage, it said.</p>
    <p>Even as vac­cine devel­op­ers move at an un­prece­dented speed to come up with a vac­cine, many chal­lenges re­main, in­clud­ing, in Arc­turus’ case, find­ing suit­able trial sites where the virus is spread­ing fast.</p>
    <p>Arc­turus’ vac­cine can­di­date is a self-repli­cat­ing mRNA vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Known as the Lu­nar-Cov19, it is in phase one/two tri­als, which are be­ing con­ducted in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The larger tri­als can start once they have locked in the dose level and dose reg­i­men, said Mr Payne, adding that the re­sults of phase one/two tri­als will be out in the cur­rent quar­ter. He said the larger phase two/three tri­als will likely in­volve mul­ti­ple coun­tries in ar­eas where there is a high preva­lence of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“If we’re con­duct­ing the study in densely pop­u­lated ar­eas where there are a lot of Covid-19 (cases), then we can prove that it works much more quickly,” Mr Payne said.</p>
    <p>“We want to make sure that a por­tion of our study is done in an area that has an i nter­na­tion­ally re­spected reg­u­la­tory agency.”</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional gov­er­nance in recog­nis­ing which vac­cines are ac­cept­able is clearly needed, said Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>It is pre­cisely why the Covax Fa­cil­ity is im­por­tant, as it sets a global stan­dard for Covid-19 vac­cines at the very least, he said.</p>
    <p>Led by the WHO, pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ship Gavi vac­cine al­liance and the Coali­tion for Epi­demic Pre­pared­ness In­no­va­tions, Covax is aimed at work­ing with vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers to pro­vide global, eq­ui­table ac­cess to Covid-19 vac­cines.</p>
    <p>It cur­rently has nine Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­dates, with an­other nine un­der eval­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“They have al­ready an­nounced the min­i­mum stan­dards for a Covid-19 vac­cine, which is a min­i­mum of 70 per cent ef­fi­cacy in a large, phase three clin­i­cal trial, if it is meant to be dis­trib­uted widely for the pur­pose of pre­vent­ing an out­break,” said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>A lower ef­fi­cacy of 50 per cent is tol­er­ated if the vac­cine is in­tended to be used for con­trol when an out­break has al­ready oc­curred, he said.</p>
    <p>At a re­cent Euro­pean con­fer­ence, ex­perts again re­it­er­ated that a vac­cine is not the be-all and en­dall. London School of Hy­giene and Trop­i­cal Medicine’s Pro­fes­sor David Hey­mann stressed the need to fight on.</p>
    <p>“I think what we need to do to­day is learn to live with the virus us­ing the tools we have, in­clud­ing the di­ag­nos­tic tests...” he said.</p>
    <p>“We just don’t know a lot about what will hap­pen with a vac­cine be­cause we don’t un­der­stand the im­mune re­sponse. The ef­forts to un­der­stand it in an­i­mal mod­els are quite un­prece­dented, as are the ef­forts in hu­mans.”</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­clear if a Covid-19 vac­cine will pro­vide long-last­ing or short-lived pro­tec­tion, what type of booster jabs might be re­quired or if the vac­cine can pre­vent re­in­fec­tion, Prof Hey­mann said.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said while some early find­ings from phase three tri­als could be an­nounced over the next few weeks, the con­clu­sive re­sults are likely to be de­ter­mined only in the early part of next year.</p>
    <p>Even then, there is still the mass pro­duc­tion and dis­tri­bu­tion is­sue.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said he ex­pects to re­ceive a vi­able vac­cine only some time in the lat­ter half of next year.</p>
