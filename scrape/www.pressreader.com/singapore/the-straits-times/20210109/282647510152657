    <p>• Three In­done­sian play­ers have been banned from all bad­minton-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties for life af­ter be­ing found guilty of of­fences re­lated to match fix­ing, match ma­nip­u­la­tion and bet­ting, the Bad­minton World Fed­er­a­tion (BWF) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Five play­ers known to the trio were also found guilty of breach­ing the gov­ern­ing body’s in­tegrity reg­u­la­tions and were sus­pended for be­tween six and 12 years. They were fined be­tween US$3,000 (S$3,970) and US$12,000 each.</p>
    <p>All eight play­ers, who com­peted in lower-level in­ter­na­tional events mostly in Asia up to 2019, were pro­vi­sion­ally sus­pended last Jan­uary af­ter a whis­tle-blower’s re­port prompted the BWF to be­gin its in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>“Three of them were found to have co­or­di­nated and or­gan­ised oth­ers into be­ing com­plicit in the be­hav­iour and have been sus­pended from all bad­minton-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties for life,” the BWF said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The fed­er­a­tion iden­ti­fied the play­ers – Hen­dra Tand­jaya, Ivandi Danang, Androw Yu­nanto, Sekar­taji Putri, Mia Mawarti, Fadilla</p>
    <p>Afni, Adi­tiya Dwiantoro and Agrip­inna Prima Rah­manto Pu­tra – in a re­port on its de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>It said they could ap­peal the de­ci­sion in the Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion for Sport (CAS) within 21 days.</p>
    <p>The BWF said a Malaysian who rep­re­sents a brand that spon­sors play­ers was also hit with a life ban for of­fer­ing money to play­ers to ma­nip­u­late matches.</p>
    <p>“The BWF In­tegrity Unit had been in­ves­ti­gat­ing the in­di­vid­ual for a num­ber of years,” the BWF said. “He abused his po­si­tion of in­flu­ence as an ex­ec­u­tive in a sport­ing brand in an at­tempt to cor­rupt in­ter­na­tional bad­minton and en­rich him­self.</p>
    <p>“Due to t he na­ture of t he breaches and this per­son’s ac­cess to and in­flu­ence over play­ers his com­pany spon­sored, the In­de­pen­dent Hear­ing Panel sus­pended the in­di­vid­ual from bad­minton-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties for life.”</p>
    <p>Hear­ings for both the cases were con­cluded late last year.</p>
