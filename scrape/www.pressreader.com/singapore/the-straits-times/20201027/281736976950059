    <p>Ion Or­chard, 313@Som­er­set and Tampines Mall were among sev­eral malls vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For 313@Som­er­set, a visit was recorded at the Go Noo­dle House eatery.</p>
    <p>Other Or­chard Road lo­ca­tions added yes­ter­day to the list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious pa­tients were Man­darin Gallery’s Wild Honey restau­rant and Or­chard Cen­tral’s Don Don Donki out­let.</p>
    <p>Vis­its were also recorded at these places: Lot One Shop­pers’ Mall’s Delifrance and Black­ball out­lets; Paya Le­bar Quar­ter mall’s Eat out­let; Kal­lang Wave Mall; Fu Lu Shou Com­plex; Kimly Zi Char in Tampines; and Our Tampines Hub’s Ko­pi­tiam out­let.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who vis­ited the places on the list at the same time should mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit. The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on the gov.sg web­site.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore also con­firmed three new coron­avirus cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing the to­tal to 57,973. There were two new im­ported cases – a stu­dent’s pass holder who re­turned from France and a de­pen­dant’s pass holder who ar­rived from the United Arab Emi­rates.</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases, but there was one case from a worker’s dor­mi­tory. The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has de­creased from four cases two weeks ago to two in the past week. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has re­mained sta­ble at two cases in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, peo­ple should col­lect their TraceTo­gether to­kens only from their con­stituency’s com­mu­nity cen­tres, the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Of­fice said last night. It urged mem­bers of the pub­lic to wait for the col­lec­tion ex­er­cise to start in their con­stituen­cies.</p>
    <p>“There is no need to col­lect the to­ken if you are al­ready us­ing the TraceTo­gether app or are able to down­load it,” the of­fice said.</p>
    <p>More de­tails on the open­ing sched­ules of col­lec­tion cen­tres will be re­leased later.</p>
