    <p>A fed­eral Is­lamic agency is fac­ing a public back­lash over a scan­dal in­volv­ing tainted meat and cakes sold in ha­lal-cer­ti­fied shops.</p>
    <p>Malaysians have crit­i­cised the Depart­ment of Is­lamic De­vel­op­ment (Jakim) for be­ing more pre­oc­cu­pied with polic­ing ha­lal-cer­ti­fied shops than in re­as­sur­ing the public af­ter news re­ports emerged that a syn­di­cate had for decades im­ported non-cer­ti­fied meat, in­clud­ing po­ten­tially diseased kan­ga­roo and horse meat, to be sold as ha­lal beef in the lo­cal mar­ket.</p>
    <p>The out­cry came af­ter Jakim an­nounced on Dec 25 that ha­lal-cer­ti­fied busi­nesses could not dis­play cakes with “Merry Christ­mas” greet­ings on them. Those who did so risked hav­ing their ha­lal cer­tifi­cates in­val­i­dated.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment fol­lowed an in­ci­dent in which a bak­ery re­fused to write “Merry Christ­mas” on a cake or­dered by a cus­tomer, re­plac­ing the greet­ing with the words “Happy Hol­i­days” in­stead. It was ap­par­ently abid­ing by rules un­der the ha­lal cer­ti­fi­ca­tion process.</p>
    <p>Jakim’s an­nounce­ment fol­lowed a Dec 24 tweet by Religious Af­fairs Min­is­ter Zulk­i­fli Mo­hamad AlBakri who said busi­nesses are al­lowed to sell cakes with Christ­mas wishes on them, as long as they are not dis­played in the shop.</p>
    <p>The ha­lal is­sue in mul­tira­cial Malaysia is a sen­si­tive mat­ter with the po­ten­tial to cause ra­cial ten­sions. Jakim, as the agency responsibl­e for cer­ti­fy­ing prod­ucts as ha­lal, or per­mis­si­ble for use by Mus­lims, has of­ten found it­self at the cen­tre of con­tro­ver­sies over the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion process.</p>
    <p>The day af­ter Datuk Dr Zulk­i­fli’s tweet, op­po­si­tion Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat MP Fahmi Fadzil urged the min­is­ter to fo­cus more on the ha­lal meat con­tro­versy than on Christ­mas greet­ings on a cake.</p>
    <p>He said the tainted meat scan­dal in­volved not just the ha­lal sta­tus of meat sold in Malaysia, but also is­sues of graft and breach of trust.</p>
    <p>“Be­tween the cake is­sue and the meat car­tel, I hope @drzul_al­bakri will be more fo­cused and proac­tive on the meat car­tel is­sue since it in­volves bribery, govern­ment ad­min­is­tra­tion, breach of trust, and even trea­son,” Mr Fahmi tweeted.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers also took to so­cial me­dia to voice their dis­sat­is­fac­tion.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter user Effi Sa­harudin wrote on Dec 25: “The XMas cake is­sue is dis­tract­ing us from the BIG­GER is­sue which is 40 year cor­rup­tion lead to haram meat.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing an emer­gency de­bate on the meat scan­dal in Par­lia­ment last week, which was livestream­ed on Face­book, ne­ti­zens ques­tioned Jakim’s ap­par­ent in­er­tia.</p>
    <p>“Jakim is just quiet as well as the religious af­fairs min­is­ter... this is spoil­ing Jakim’s name,” said Face­book user Normah Ramli.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian Mus­lim Con­sumers As­so­ci­a­tion last Tues­day crit­i­cised what it saw as a lack of trans­parency and progress in in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the meat scan­dal.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion’s head ac­tivist, Datuk Nadzim Jo­han, said it had pro­vided in­for­ma­tion on the syn­di­cate’s ac­tiv­i­ties to var­i­ous agen­cies be­fore the re­ports were pub­lished.</p>
    <p>He said the as­so­ci­a­tion had, on Nov 25, met or­gan­i­sa­tions in­clud­ing the Malaysian Quar­an­tine and In­spec­tion Ser­vices Depart­ment and police to dis­cuss the is­sue.</p>
    <p>“Like all Mus­lim con­sumers, we are con­cerned that ac­tion isn’t be­ing taken against those responsibl­e. Tak­ing im­me­di­ate ac­tion will send a strong sig­nal to other syn­di­cates in­volved in other crimes and pro­tect our con­sumers,” Mr Nadzim was quoted as say­ing by The New Straits Times daily.</p>
    <p>He claimed pol­i­cy­mak­ers were in­flu­enced by the syn­di­cate, which told govern­ment of­fi­cials it was cheaper to im­port the meat prod­ucts than pro­duce them lo­cally.</p>
    <p>Jakim last week re­sponded to the crit­i­cism, say­ing it was not tak­ing part in the probe and that 300 govern­ment agen­cies are in­volved in the ha­lal-cer­ti­fi­ca­tion process.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party MP Steven Sim said: “The is­sue of meat car­tels is not just a prob­lem for Mus­lims. Now, the qual­ity and nu­tri­tion of all our food is a ques­tion mark. If non-ha­lal meat can enter (Malaysia) due to cor­rup­tion, is it pos­si­ble that diseased or con­tam­i­nated meat can also get through?”</p>
