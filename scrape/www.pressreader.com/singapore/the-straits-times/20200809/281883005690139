    <p>Ms Wong Chin Ling, 59, led the devel­op­ment of the Cen­tre for Cli­mate Re­search Sin­ga­pore at the Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore (MSS) to sup­port Sin­ga­pore’s cli­mate re­silience strat­egy.</p>
    <p>She led the devel­op­ment of the Na­tional Sea Level Pro­gramme last year to im­prove un­der­stand­ing of ris­ing sea lev­els here. She also headed the Asean Spe­cialised Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Cen­tre, hosted by MSS, which pro­vided early warn­ings of trans­bound­ary haze in 2015 and 2019.</p>
    <p>She led Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess­ful bid to host the World Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WMO) Re­gional Of­fice for Asia and South-West Pa­cific, which be­gan oper­a­tions in 2018. As an elected mem­ber of the WMO ex­ec­u­tive coun­cil since 2015, she has raised the pro­file of Sin­ga­pore in the in­ter­na­tional me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said she is grate­ful to re­ceive this award and sees it as recog­ni­tion of the MSS’ work.</p>
    <p>“MSS has been build­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties in cli­mate sci­ence and sea-level re­search, and forg­ing col­lab­o­ra­tions na­tion­ally and in­ter­na­tion­ally. These de­vel­op­ments are deeply ful­fill­ing to me as they will con­trib­ute to strength­en­ing our na­tion’s cli­mate re­silience,” she said.</p>
    <p>Since join­ing the Sin­ga­pore Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board in 2007, Mr Khalil A. Bakar, 37, has helped to drive the job and busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties in Sin­ga­pore’s en­ergy and chem­i­cals sec­tor by carv­ing out new ar­eas of devel­op­ment, in­clud­ing de­car­bon­i­sa­tion, hy­dro­gen, bio­fu­els and poly­mer ad­di­tive man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>He has also con­tributed to a study on the fu­ture of en­ergy and chem­i­cals, which aims to en­sure the longterm com­pet­i­tive­ness and sus­tain­able growth of the in­dus­try. Mr Khalil, who is now on sec­ond­ment to the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the Environmen­t, said sus­tain­abil­ity and cli­mate change are an in­creas­ingly im­por­tant part of Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional agenda.</p>
    <p>“I am ex­cited to con­tinue work­ing with my pub­lic sec­tor col­leagues and pri­vate sec­tor part­ners to ad­vance Sin­ga­pore’s en­ergy tran­si­tion jour­ney, as we build up ca­pa­bil­i­ties for a com­pet­i­tive and sus­tain­able low-car­bon fu­ture.”</p>
