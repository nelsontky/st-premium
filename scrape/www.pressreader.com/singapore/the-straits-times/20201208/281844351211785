    <p>CAN­BERRA • Aus­tralia lacks an over­ar­ch­ing ap­proach to han­dling a “much more as­sertive” China and needs a plan for eco­nomic di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and li­ais­ing with Asian al­lies to han­dle the emerg­ing su­per­power, op­po­si­tion for­eign af­fairs spokesman Penny Wong has said.</p>
    <p>“The strat­egy should be work­ing out how we deal with the ef­fects for Aus­tralia and the re­gion of a China which demon­stra­bly is tak­ing a very dif­fer­ent stance,” Ms Wong told ABC’s In­sid­ers pro­gramme on Sun­day. “The gov­ern­ment re­ally does need to stop fo­cus­ing on splashy head­lines and work out what is it do­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ties have been fraught since 2018, when Can­berra barred Huawei from build­ing its 5G net­work, and it went into free fall ear­lier this year when Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son called for an in­de­pen­dent probe into the ori­gins of the Covid-19 pan­demic, lead­ing to trade reprisals.</p>
    <p>Last week, he sought an apol­ogy from China af­ter a diplo­mat in Bei­jing tweeted an im­age pur­port­ing to show an Aus­tralian sol­dier hold­ing a knife to an Afghan child’s throat. That re­lated to an in­ves­ti­ga­tion that un­cov­ered war crimes by Aus­tralian troops in Afghanista­n.</p>
    <p>“The re­la­tion­ship is ob­vi­ously in a very dif­fi­cult and chal­leng­ing place,” Ms Wong said. “Go­ing for­ward, I think we should as­sume that a more as­sertive, at times more ag­gres­sive, China is here to stay.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the crit­i­cism, the op­po­si­tion La­bor Party has sought to main­tain a bi­par­ti­san re­sponse to China’s ac­tions, with Ms Wong say­ing it is im­por­tant to “re­main uni­fied in our con­dem­na­tion”.</p>
    <p>De­bate has sim­mered on whether Mr Mor­ri­son was cor­rect to re­spond so quickly to the tweet.</p>
    <p>A vis­i­bly an­gry prime min­is­ter called a press con­fer­ence 45 min­utes af­ter it was posted.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son re­port­edly only spoke with his for­eign min­is­ter be­fore­hand and Ms Wong said he did not get in con­tact with La­bor.</p>
    <p>“It is a big call to go di­rectly, es­ca­late di­rectly, to the na­tional leader and I hope that Scott Mor­ri­son thought very care­fully about that de­ci­sion. I hope that he took ad­vice,” she said.</p>
    <p>China re­fused to apol­o­gise. In­stead, the Chi­nese for­eign min­istry’s top spokesman shot back, ask­ing whether Mr Mor­ri­son lacks “a sense of right and wrong”.</p>
    <p>Asked whether Aus­tralia should boy­cott the Win­ter Olympics in China in 2022, Ms Wong said the op­po­si­tion’s view – and she un­der­stood this to be the gov­ern­ment’s too – is that the event is an op­por­tu­nity to fo­cus on hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>“China talked about the im­por­tance of hu­man rights this week in the tweet,” Ms Wong said.</p>
    <p>“Equally, I as­sume that they will there­fore recog­nise the right of other na­tions and other com­mu­ni­ties to raise the is­sue of hu­man rights in the con­text of the Olympics.”</p>
