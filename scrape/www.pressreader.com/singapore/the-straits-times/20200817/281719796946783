    <p>BALIK PU­LAU • Malaysia has placed sev­eral ar­eas of Pe­nang un­der stricter move­ment con­trols as new coro­n­avirus cases threaten to flare up again in the north­ern state after a 100-day hia­tus.</p>
    <p>The lo­cal au­thor­i­ties are on high alert and have im­posed re­stric­tions after new Covid-19 cases be­gan sprout­ing up in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Road­side hawk­ers are no longer al­lowed to have dine-in cus­tomers and can of­fer only take­aways. Restau­rants and cof­fee shops are al­lowed to have dine-in pa­trons, but stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures on phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing need to be ob­served strictly, with no crowding al­lowed.</p>
    <p>The af­fected ar­eas are Teluk Kum­bar, Sun­gai Batu and Ger­tak Sang­gul on Pe­nang Is­land, and cen­tral and south­ern Se­berang Prai dis­tricts on the main­land.</p>
    <p>Night bazaars are closed for now. The Pe­nang Is­land city coun­cil also warned that the morn­ing mar­ket in Ta­man Sa­ha­bat, Teluk Kum­bar, would be shut down if the com­mu­nity does not strictly ad­here to safety pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>A 58-year-old woman who lives in Ta­man Sa­ha­bat was con­firmed to have the virus last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, the ru­ral sub­urb ap­peared to be a ghost town with only a hand­ful of shops and stalls open and hardly any­one about.</p>
    <p>Ms Nor Fazila Jaa­far, 33, who works at a Malay food shop, said she was told on Satur­day morn­ing that they had to stop al­low­ing dine-in. “Busi­ness was so bad. We cooked less, but we still only sold 30 per cent of the food all morn­ing and af­ter­noon,” she said.</p>
    <p>Pe­nang Chief Min­is­ter Chow Kon Yeow said yes­ter­day that there are no clus­ters in Pe­nang and the new cases over the past few days are due to clus­ters from other states.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Malaysia’s health chief said yes­ter­day that a mu­ta­tion that is far more in­fec­tious than the orig­i­nal Wuhan strain has been de­tected in the coun­try. The D614G mu­ta­tion was dis­cov­ered by the Malaysian In­sti­tute for Med­i­cal Re­search in four cases from two clus­ters – the Si­va­gangga and Ulu Ti­ram clus­ters, health chief Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day. “It is found to be 10 times more in­fec­tious and is eas­ily spread by an in­di­vid­ual su­per spreader,” he said.</p>
    <p>Malaysia re­ported 25 new cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of in­fec­tions so far to 9,200. No new fa­tal­i­ties were re­ported, keep­ing the death toll at 125.</p>
