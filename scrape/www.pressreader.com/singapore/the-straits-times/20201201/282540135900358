    <p>SO MANY STAYCAYS, SO LIT­TLE TIME. WHAT MAKES THIS HO­TEL SPE­CIAL?</p>
    <p>De­signed by Pritzker Ar­chi­tec­ture Prize-win­ning ar­chi­tect Kevin Roche, the Ritz-Carl­ton Mil­lenia Sin­ga­pore’s dis­tinct geo­met­ric lines and oc­tag­o­nal win­dows have be­come a beloved icon of the Ma­rina Bay land­scape. It was named one of the “World’s Sex­i­est Bath­rooms” by the Tatler Cu­nard Travel Guide soon af­ter it opened in 1996.</p>
    <p>It has since been re­fur­bished over the years, with the Colony and Sum­mer Pav­il­ion restau­rants re­freshed in 2015, and the spa, pool and fit­ness cen­tre given a new look in 2016. The guest rooms and its</p>
    <p>Club Lounge were re­fur­bished in 2013.</p>
    <p>FIRST IM­PRES­SIONS?</p>
    <p>Af­ter I cleared SafeEn­try pro­to­cols, a staff mem­ber quickly ush­ered me from the lift to the checkin counter, while alert­ing his col­leagues via his ear­piece mi­cro­phone that “Ms Stephanie” had ar­rived. I felt like a VIP. My hus­band, who ar­rived separately from the gym, was also treated with the same warmth.</p>
    <p>We were soon whisked away to our 775 sq ft Premier Suite on the 22nd floor.</p>
    <p>This cor­ner suite (from $850++ per night) is the only room type with a bath­room that over­looks the Sin­ga­pore Flyer, but the liv­ing area also has a breath­tak­ing view of Ma­rina Bay, which made it per­fect for our cou­ple we­fies.</p>
    <p>Even though the rooms were last ren­o­vated seven years ago, the suite still looked and felt lux­u­ri­ous.</p>
    <p>DID THE COU­PLE’S SPA TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY?</p>
    <p>Cou­ple spa treat­ments may be a ro­man­tic cliche, but given the ex­cep­tional times we live in, I think they are a fun way for part­ners to sur­ren­der to the mo­ment.</p>
    <p>We cer­tainly did at The Ritz-Carl</p>
    <p>ton Spa, where we spent an in­dul­gent hour hav­ing mas­sages.</p>
    <p>My hus­band’s 60-minute Mus­cle Re­cov­ery mas­sage ($210++) was ex­actly what he needed to re­cover from his in­ten­sive ex­er­cise regime, so much so that he said “I want to sleep” right af­ter it. Not the mood I was aim­ing for, but at least he was re­laxed.</p>
    <p>My 60-minute Hot Lapis Stone Mas­sage ($210++) was sim­i­larly ther­a­peu­tic, the warm blue stones ra­di­at­ing their heal­ing touch as my ther­a­pist ran them up and down my tired limbs. Hot stone mas­sages can be too blis­ter­ing for com­fort, but this one was per­fect.</p>
    <p>If you are clas­si­cal mu­sic lovers and have a spe­cial oc­ca­sion to cel­e­brate, the ho­tel also of­fers a unique Cello Con­certo treat­ment, where a cel­list per­forms live within the spa suite while you and your sig­nif­i­cant other en­joy a 60-minute mas­sage. The $720++ pack­age comes with a 30-minute hy­drother­apy bath ex­pe­ri­ence as well. Book at least 48 hours in ad­vance.</p>
    <p>IDEAS FOR A RO­MAN­TIC NIGHTCAP?</p>
    <p>The Ritz is fa­mous for its but­ler­drawn bath, so we opted for the Re­lax­ation Bath ($50++) as our af­ter-din­ner treat.</p>
    <p>A friendly staff mem­ber ar­rived at 9pm with a tray of ESPA bath oil and two cups of creamy bath liq­uid, which he ex­pertly blended and coaxed into a bub­ble won­der­land.</p>
    <p>The re­sult was sudsy, warm and calm­ing, with an in­tox­i­cat­ing blend of san­dal­wood, rose gera­nium and frank­in­cense that ap­pealed to my hus­band and me.</p>
    <p>The bath­tub was a bit of a tight fit for two to re­cline, but the view of the Flyer’s twin­kling lights against the night sky was sur­pris­ingly mes­meris­ing.</p>
    <p>If you want to make this mo­ment even more spe­cial, I would rec­om­mend ring­ing room ser­vice in ad­vance for your favourite bub­bly, or bring­ing your own.</p>
    <p>IS THERE BREAK­FAST IN BED?</p>
    <p>Not quite, but a leisurely break­fast in our room on a rainy morn­ing was a won­der­ful way to start the day to­gether, with no Zoom calls to rush to, no kids to ferry and no agenda.</p>
    <p>As with many other ho­tels now, or­ders must be placed the night be­fore, and I was happy to see the ex­ten­sive choices avail­able, in­clud­ing a Healthy Break­fast set where you can tuck into an egg white omelette with chia seeds, and Bircher muesli.</p>
    <p>My Amer­i­can break­fast was huge, with eggs, chicken sausage, hash browns, baked goods and more. The spread was so good, we pol­ished off ev­ery­thing.</p>
    <p>TIME TO POP THE QUES­TION: BLISS OR MISS?</p>
    <p>If you ask me, love is not about the grand gestures but the lit­tle de­tails. While it may not in­spire the dopamine rush of a trendy new ho­tel, the Ritz-Carl­ton – where I’ve stayed sev­eral times – has my heart for its leg­endary ser­vice.</p>
    <p>We were bowled over by the sin­cer­ity of the staff who did all they could to make our brief stay an unforgetta­ble ex­pe­ri­ence. It was com­fort­ing to see that the magic of the Ritz is still very much alive, even with masks on.</p>
    <p>This stay­ca­tion was hosted by the ho­tel and is part of a weekly se­ries. For more stay­ca­tion re­views, go to str.sg/SuiteLife</p>
