    <p>SAN FRANCISCO • Sil­i­con Val­ley is see­ing de­par­tures of some of its high-pro­file stars as a pan­demic-linked shift to re­mote work and po­lit­i­cal po­lar­i­sa­tion have dulled the al­lure of the key tech in­dus­try hub.</p>
    <p>Night­mar­ish traf­fic and high liv­ing costs were al­ready caus­ing dis­en­chant­ment even be­fore the pan­demic spoilt the serendip­ity of the north­ern Cal­i­for­nia des­ti­na­tion for top tal­ent. Droughts and ram­pant wild­fires have also taken a toll.</p>
    <p>Those lead­ing the ex­o­dus in­clude Tesla chief Elon Musk and Or­a­cle co-founder Larry El­li­son, along with Palan­tir co-founder Peter Thiel and the data an­a­lyt­ics firm’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Alex Karp.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies are also pack­ing up and mov­ing their head­quar­ters, in­clud­ing Sil­i­con Val­ley stal­warts Or­a­cle and Hewlett Packard En­ter­prise (HPE), both headed for Texas.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1977 in Sil­i­con Val­ley, Or­a­cle said this month it was mov­ing to po­si­tion the com­pany “for growth and pro­vide our per­son­nel with more flex­i­bil­ity about where and how they work”.</p>
    <p>HPE, a spin-off of the his­toric Sil­i­con Val­ley firm Hewlett-Packard, said it was mov­ing to Hous­ton “to meet cus­tomers where they are in their dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tions in these ex­tra­or­di­nary times”.</p>
    <p>“There was al­ways a risk over Cal­i­for­nia that a crit­i­cal mass of peo­ple would say there is no sense do­ing busi­ness there be­cause peo­ple can’t live here,” said in­de­pen­dent tech an­a­lyst Rob Enderle, a na­tive of the state who left it for Ore­gon some six years ago.</p>
    <p>States where taxes and liv­ing costs are lower are court­ing tech com­pa­nies that can ne­go­ti­ate for in­cen­tives to move there.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Or­a­cle chief tech­nol­ogy of­fi­cer Larry El­li­son told em­ploy­ees that he is mov­ing to the Hawai­ian is­land of Lanai, which he bought eight years ago, and will telecom­mute.</p>
    <p>The move comes with in­creas­ing num­bers of tech­nol­ogy firms al­low­ing work­ers to do their jobs re­motely due to the pan­demic, di­min­ish­ing the need for cam­pus-style head­quar­ters, for which the re­gion is known. Twit­ter, for one, has said em­ploy­ees may work re­motely in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk, Tesla’s co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive, has con­firmed that he left Cal­i­for­nia for Texas af­ter a heated squab­ble ear­lier this year with the au­thor­i­ties, over his ef­forts to defy a state shut­down of his fac­tory to stop the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>He jus­ti­fied the move by say­ing he needed to be closer to two of his big­gest projects: the de­vel­op­ment of rock­ets by his com­pany SpaceX in the south­ern part of the state, and con­struc­tion of a Tesla au­to­mo­bile plant near state cap­i­tal Austin.</p>
    <p>“How many peo­ple have the op­tion of mov­ing to their is­land?” Creative Strate­gies an­a­lyst Carolina Mi­lanesi said, cau­tion­ing against view­ing the lat­est de­par­tures as a sign of a mass ex­o­dus. “These peo­ple have dif­fer­ent mo­ti­va­tions, some of it is po­lit­i­cal.”</p>
    <p>While In­ter­net firms Brex, Drop­box and Splunk each took root and grew in the re­gion, their re­spec­tive chiefs have left the San Francisco area. Se­cre­tive data an­a­lyt­ics gi­ant Palan­tir, val­ued at more than US$20 bil­lion (S$26.6 bil­lion) in its Wall Street de­but late this year, was cre­ated in Sil­i­con Val­ley but left for Den­ver.</p>
    <p>Palan­tir co-founder Joe Lons­dale, mean­while, moved his ven­ture cap­i­tal firm from San Francisco to Austin, say­ing tax rates and po­lit­i­cal ide­ol­ogy were fac­tors. “Austin is far more tol­er­ant of ide­o­log­i­cal di­ver­sity than SF,” Mr Lons­dale said in a tweet last month.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Mr Thiel an­nounced his de­par­ture from the Bay Area for Los An­ge­les, in an ap­par­ently po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated move. He was a rare Don­ald Trump sup­porter in Sil­i­con Val­ley.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ees are vir­tual and the cost of mov­ing a head­quar­ters has dropped,” Mr Enderle said. “If you were up­set, now is the time to move.”</p>
    <p>It is com­mon for Sil­i­con Val­ley com­pa­nies to spread to new cities while re­tain­ing their Cal­i­for­nia ties, noted an­a­lyst Pa­trick Moor­head of Moor In­sights and Strat­egy, who long ago traded Cal­i­for­nia for Austin.</p>
    <p>“They are just mov­ing their head­quar­ters; they have an out­post in Sil­i­con Val­ley,” he said.</p>
    <p>HPE al­ready had more peo­ple in Hous­ton that any other city be­fore it re­cently an­nounced plans to move its head­quar­ters to Texas, Mr Moor­head noted.</p>
    <p>Ms Mi­lanesi said: “I don’t see Ap­ple and Google mov­ing away from here any time soon.”</p>
    <p>She warned that a big­ger trend in play could be other coun­tries, such as China and Is­rael, out­shin­ing the United States over­all as hubs for tech in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Other coun­tries are bet­ter sub­si­dis­ing re­search and start-ups, pro­mot­ing sciences in school­ing, and en­cour­ag­ing in­no­va­tion and patents, ac­cord­ing to the an­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>“A part of that is a lot of the tal­ent in Sil­i­con Val­ley is im­mi­grants or the chil­dren of im­mi­grants,” Ms Mi­lanesi said.</p>
    <p>“The US, par­tic­u­larly in the last four years, has not been very wel­com­ing.”</p>
    <p>EAS­IER TO MOVE</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ees are vir­tual and the cost of mov­ing a head­quar­ters has dropped. If you were up­set, now is the time to move.</p>
