    <p>BEI­JING • Ten­cent Hold­ings has of­fered to buy out and take private search en­gine So­gou in a US$2.1 bil­lion (S$2.9 bil­lion) deal, adding to a slew of Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy gi­ants seek­ing to delist from United States bourses.</p>
    <p>Shares of the so­cial me­dia heavy­weight climbed as much as 4.7 per cent yes­ter­day, buoyed by spec­u­la­tion that it will more closely in­te­grate So­gou’s AI tech­nol­ogy with its own services and de­vices to gain an edge on ri­vals like TikTokowne­r ByteDance.</p>
    <p>Ten­cent has i n re­cent years come un­der pres­sure from ByteDance and other up-and-com­ing ri­vals in the emer­gent short­video arena. Bei­jing-based So­gou – whose name trans­lates as “search dog” – has long been the de­fault in a slew of Ten­cent prod­ucts, in­clud­ing its mar­quee so­cial app WeChat.</p>
    <p>A takeover of So­gou also raises the prospect of a lu­cra­tive list­ing in Hong Kong or Shang­hai in the fu­ture, on the heels of well-re­ceived de­buts by Alibaba Group Holding and JD.com. It has be­come an in­creas­ingly at­trac­tive route for tech gi­ants such as Mr Jack Ma’s Ant Group, which is speed­ing to­wards what could be the city’s big­gest float in years.</p>
    <p>So­gou chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Wang Xiaochuan in 2018 de­clared his am­bi­tion to list on main­land bourses when reg­u­la­tions per­mit.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese In­ter­net com­pa­nies are ex­plor­ing list­ings closer to home af­ter a pro­posed US Bill threat­ened to force them to delist from New York by im­pos­ing stricter dis­clo­sure re­quire­ments, a prospect that looks in­creas­ingly plau­si­ble as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion amps up ac­tion against Bei­jing on mul­ti­ple fronts. On­line gam­ing com­pany Changyou.com got taken private this year by Sohu.com, and 58.com is be­ing bought out by a private eq­uity con­sor­tium for US$8.7 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The “mar­ket has been an­tic­i­pat­ing more com­pa­nies to pur­sue sec­ondary list­ing in Hong Kong”, Jef­feries an­a­lysts wrote. “We con­sider there will be more syn­er­gies between So­gou and Ten­cent in search and smart de­vices in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Ten­cent is of­fer­ing US$9 in cash for each Amer­i­can de­posi­tary share it does not al­ready hold in So­gou, backed by Sohu.com – a 57 per cent pre­mium to the tar­get com­pany’s Friday close.</p>
    <p>So­gou said in a state­ment it was con­sid­er­ing the takeover of­fer, though Ten­cent al­ready owns about 39.2 per cent of the firm.</p>
    <p>So­gou, founded i n 2005 and merged with Ten­cent’s Soso search busi­ness i n 2013, has counted on its part­ner­ship with the larger com­pany to help it catch search leader Baidu.</p>
    <p>Sohu’s shares gained 40 per cent in New York, their most i n a decade, while So­gou leapt a record 48 per cent.</p>
