    <p>I was dis­ap­pointed that in­stead of the root cause of ris­ing health­care costs be­ing tack­led, it has been pro­posed that MediShield Life pre­mi­ums be in­creased to pay for wider ben­e­fits and ris­ing health­care costs (MediShield Life cov­er­age set to widen next year, Sept 30).</p>
    <p>There was al­ready a huge in­cre­ment in our pre­mi­ums with the switch from MediShield to MediShield Life in 2015.</p>
    <p>If we need to keep do­ing this ev­ery five years just to keep up with ris­ing health­care costs, it won’t be sus­tain­able for most Sin­ga­pore­ans, es­pe­cially with the age­ing pop­u­la­tion, as pre­mi­ums are go­ing to in­crease with age as well.</p>
    <p>Not to men­tion that those on pri­vate In­te­grated Shield Plans (IPs) that come with rid­ers or add-ons of­fer­ing 100 per cent cov­er­age will be at a dis­ad­van­tage, as they could end up pay­ing even more with­out ad­di­tional cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>The pri­vate IP in­sur­ers are not go­ing to re­duce their pre­mi­ums for the rid­ers even if there is any over­lap of cov­er­age from MediShield Life.</p>
    <p>I hope the Min­istry of Health (MOH) will put in more ef­fort to in­ves­ti­gate and ad­dress the root cause of ris­ing health­care costs, in­stead of rais­ing pre­mi­ums ad in­fini­tum. Some ar­eas to look at are:</p>
    <p>Doc­tors who prac­tise de­fen­sive medicine out of fear of get­ting sued for miss­ing out any di­ag­no­sis of sick­ness, lead­ing to over-con­sump­tion of health­care treat­ments.</p>
    <p>Abuse of hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion by pa­tients who don’t need treat­ment in hos­pi­tal, but are given the op­tion to do so in or­der to qual­ify for in­sur­ance claims. Markup of med­i­cal bills to the claim lim­its to max­imise profit. If MOH is able to ef­fec­tively deal with such abuse and fraud­u­lent prac­tices, this should bring health­care costs un­der con­trol and pre­mi­ums won’t have to be in­creased ev­ery few years.</p>
    <p>Letters should be meant for ex­clu­sive pub­li­ca­tion in The Straits Times. They should be no longer than 400 words and must in­clude the writer’s full name, ad­dress and phone num­bers.

Read­ers can also re­spond to letters via Face­book and Twit­ter.</p>
