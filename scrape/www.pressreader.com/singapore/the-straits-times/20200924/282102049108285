    <p>More than 1,000 Ae­tos se­cu­rity of­fi­cers will get to up­grade their skills through a new three-tiered train­ing pro­gramme, un­der a Mem­o­ran­dum of Un­der­stand­ing (MOU) signed be­tween the se­cu­rity firm and the Union of Se­cu­rity Em­ploy­ees yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme – which cen­tres on the cre­ation of a Com­pany Train­ing Com­mit­tee (CTC) – will pro­vide ad­vanced train­ing pack­ages to teach the se­cu­rity of­fi­cers new skill sets rang­ing from in­creased dig­i­tal savvi­ness, emer­gency re­sponse and first aid to cus­tomer ser­vice and fa­cil­i­ties man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The cour­ses will be cus­tomised and cu­rated for the Ae­tos se­cu­rity of­fi­cers de­pend­ing on the fa­cil­ity and lo­ca­tion where they are posted.</p>
    <p>Ae­tos rep­re­sen­ta­tives said the skill up­grad­ing would not only lead to a more ef­fi­cient work­force, but also boost the wages and job op­por­tu­ni­ties for the se­cu­rity off icers.</p>
    <p>The MOU sign­ing was wit­nessed by the Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), Mr Ng Chee Meng, and the Group Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Of­fi­cer of Sur­bana Jurong Group, Mr Wong Heang Fine.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said that un­der the pro­gres­sive wage model – im­ple­mented by the Government to in­crease wages by up­grad­ing skills and im­prov­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity in var­i­ous sec­tors – the pay for se­cu­rity of­fi­cers has gone up by about 14 per cent since 2018.</p>
    <p>The pro­gres­sive wage model was put in place for the se­cu­rity in­dus­try in Septem­ber 2016. Ac­cord­ing to fig­ures from NTUC, se­cu­rity of­fi­cers who earned $1,922 in gross monthly wages in 2018 now take home $2,184 ev­ery month.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery worker and ev­ery job mat­ters, and in par­tic­u­lar for low wage sec­tors in Sin­ga­pore, we will do our best to help,” said Mr Ng .</p>
    <p>“In the last two years, we have seen bet­ter pro­duc­tiv­ity growth in the se­cu­rity sec­tor, which has been very en­cour­ag­ing.”</p>
    <p>He added that pro­grammes like Ae­tos’ would help com­pa­nies and their staff con­tin­u­ally learn and up­grade them­selves as Sin­ga­pore pro­gresses to­wards “In­dus­try 4.0” – when au­to­mated tech­nolo­gies pow­ered by data may be able to per­form ev­ery­day tasks.</p>
    <p>The CTC pro­gramme at Ae­tos comes in three tiers, with train­ing pack­ages de­liv­ered through a se­ries of vir­tual class­room and phys­i­cal train­ing cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Se­nior se­cu­rity of­fi­cer Ray­mond Ng Way Hong, 59, said he hopes to pur­sue pro­grammes in first aid and fire safety.</p>
    <p>“I would like to take part in new cour­ses to up­grade my­self. This is a new chal­lenge for me and where rel­e­vant, I would like to ex­plore op­por­tu­ni­ties to keep learn­ing and stay cur­rent,” said Mr Ng, who made a ca­reer switch to se­cu­rity work in 2018 af­ter 26 years in the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng also wel­comes Ae­tos’ plans to raise the re­tire­ment and re-em­ploy­ment ages to 65 and 70 re­spec­tively, from Oct 1.</p>
    <p>“As long as I am phys­i­cally fit, I would like to keep go­ing,” he said.</p>
