    <p>•</p>
    <p>Mu­sic lovers were en­joy­ing an opera, with young peo­ple in bars rais­ing a fi­nal glass to­gether be­fore a new coro­n­avirus lock­down, when gun­men sud­denly opened fire in Vi­enna, bru­tally shat­ter­ing the calm of the Aus­trian cap­i­tal late on Mon­day night.</p>
    <p>At l east four peo­ple were killed, with sev­eral wounded, when at­tack­ers opened fire in six cen­tral lo­ca­tions – in­clud­ing one near a syn­a­gogue – at around 8pm lo­cal time.</p>
    <p>Wit­nesses said they saw a man shoot “like crazy” with what ap­peared to be an au­to­matic weapon, be­fore po­lice ar­rived and opened fire.</p>
    <p>“They looked like fire­crack­ers, then we re­alised that they were gun­shots,” said one wit­ness on public broad­caster ORF.</p>
    <p>With one as­sailant shot dead, the city’s mayor urged peo­ple to re­main in­doors as po­lice said a huge man­hunt was un­der way for one of the at­tack­ers.</p>
    <p>Vi­enna had un­til now been spared the sort of ma­jor ter­ror at­tacks that have hit other Euro­pean coun­tries, with France ex­pe­ri­enc­ing two ter­ror at­tacks just last month.</p>
    <p>“We are deal­ing with a ter­ror at­tack the sever­ity of which, thank God, we have not ex­pe­ri­enced in Austria in many years,” the city’s mayor Michael Lud­wig said at a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Said waiter Jimmy Eroglu, 42: “At the be­gin­ning, I thought to my­self that maybe we were mak­ing an Amer­i­can film or that they had drunk too much.”</p>
    <p>But then, he heard shots.</p>
    <p>“The po­lice came in and said, ‘you all have to stay in­side be­cause there’s prob­a­bly a dead man there’.”</p>
    <p>Vi­enna’s po­lice re­peat­edly urged res­i­dents to take shel­ter wher­ever they were as the man­hunt got un­der way, with heli­copters sweep­ing the skies above the city and of­fi­cers hastily erect­ing cor­dons on streets that only hours ear­lier were thronged with peo­ple en­joy­ing a last drink be­fore lock­down.</p>
    <p>Mr Robert Schneider, who lives in cen­tral Vi­enna, left his house briefly and found two lasers trained on his chest.</p>
    <p>“Hands up, take off your jacket,” of­fi­cers shouted at him, the 39-year-old told AFP. He added: “We had seen noth­ing, heard noth­ing. We are in shock.”</p>
    <p>Mr Gernot Gruber, 25, said he ini­tially thought the sounds were fire­works set off by peo­ple ahead of the lock­down.</p>
    <p>“If you hear these noises in Austria, you don’t think they’re gun­shots, you re­ally don’t,” he told The Guardian news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>Mr Gruber, en route to the Hard Rock cafe around the cor­ner from one of the sites of the at­tacks, said he had heard about sim­i­lar in­ci­dents in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“But I’ve never been close to one. It was re­ally fright­en­ing.”</p>
