    <p>When Mr Loh Chi Jie set up his 3Dprint­ing com­pany Siege Ad­vanced Man­u­fac­tur­ing in 2017, he never ex­pected to be print­ing about 30,000 face shields in the midst of a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Since March, Mr Loh, a grad­u­ate in me­chan­i­cal en­gi­neer­ing from the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore, has worked with his firm’s team to pro­duce re­us­able plas­tic face shields, dis­tribut­ing them to 13 lo­cal or­gan­i­sa­tions and 14 other ben­e­fi­cia­ries across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mr Loh, 28, re­ceived the Peo­ple of Good award at the Pres­i­dent’s Vol­un­teerism and Phi­lan­thropy Awards cer­e­mony at the Is­tana yes­ter­day for his con­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>“My team and I wanted to do what we could to help peo­ple in need, es­pe­cially af­ter we saw im­ages of health­care work­ers in the re­gion us­ing trash bags or cling wrap as per­sonal pro­tec­tion equip­ment.</p>
    <p>“It was a round-the-clock process and I slept in the of­fice for about four months so that I could re­place the print­ers with new ma­te­rial once one round was com­pleted,” he re­called.</p>
    <p>For Mr Loh, the long hours paid off when he saw an im­age of In­done­sian health­care work­ers us­ing his com­pany’s printed face shields.</p>
    <p>The firm pushed on, adapt­ing to new chal­lenges as the months pro­gressed.</p>
    <p>When face masks be­came com­pul­sory in Sin­ga­pore, Mr Loh heard of com­plaints from the pub­lic about pain build­ing be­hind the ears from pro­longed use of the masks.</p>
    <p>The team gave out 30,000 ear savers to Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents for free through its web­site as well as on­line plat­form Carousell.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, Mr Loh said he was proud of what the com­pany had achieved: “This award is a recog­ni­tion of the con­tri­bu­tions of the 3Dprint­ing in­dus­try dur­ing the pan­demic. There is more po­ten­tial for so­cial good that can be achieved through such tech­nol­ogy.”</p>
