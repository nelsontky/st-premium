    <p>In­dia is set to hold its first com­mer­cial coal mine auc­tions in Oc­to­ber, and is ac­cept­ing bids with tech­ni­cal spec­i­fi­ca­tions. In the next phase, short­listed firms will sub­mit fi­nan­cial bids. But the coal min­istry has al­ready had to re­view the ini­tial list of 41 coal blocks be­cause of op­po­si­tion from states with the largest coal re­serves.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment-owned Coal In­dia has a seven-decade monopoly on coal min­ing and it ac­counts for 80 per cent of the coal mined in the coun­try. Pri­vate com­pa­nies could mine coal for their own use, but not for sale to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Narendra Modi an­nounced on June 18 a pol­icy to al­low for­eign in­vestors, non-min­ing en­ti­ties and large min­ers to mine coal com­mer­cially, with­out re­stric­tions on end-use or price.</p>
    <p>Af­ter ini­tially al­low­ing 100 per cent for­eign direct in­vest­ment, the coal min­istry is­sued a no­ti­fi­ca­tion, fol­low­ing bor­der clashes with China in Ladakh last month, ask­ing for­eign in­vestors to seek ap­proval be­fore par­tic­i­pat­ing.</p>
    <p>Coal min­is­ter Pral­had Joshi said that de­spite hav­ing the world’s fourth-largest coal re­serves, In­dia im­ports around 235 mil­lion tonnes of coal a year. The govern­ment wants to re­place this with do­mes­tic sup­ply.</p>
    <p>The 41 new blocks have 225 mil­lion tonnes of coal, and their com­mer­cial auc­tion is ex­pected to raise 330 bil­lion ru­pees (S$6.1 bil­lion). The coal sites are spread across five states.</p>
    <p>As soon as auc­tions were an­nounced, the govern­ment of Jhark­hand, a forested cen­tral In­dian state with nine of the 41 coal blocks, chal­lenged the de­ci­sion in the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>The state has the largest coal re­serves in the coun­try and a quar­ter of its pop­u­la­tion is from in­dige­nous com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Jhark­hand’s le­gal suit claims the fed­eral govern­ment’s ac­tion is “uni­lat­eral, high-handed, ar­bi­trary and il­le­gal”, and that it is in­ap­pro­pri­ate to hold auc­tions dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic when the state ma­chin­ery should be work­ing to “al­le­vi­ate the prob­lems of cit­i­zens”.</p>
    <p>Six of Jhark­hand’s nine al­lot­ted coal blocks fall in ar­eas with large in­dige­nous pop­u­la­tions who have spe­cial con­sti­tu­tional pro­tec­tions. Auc­tion of mines in these ar­eas would im­pinge on their rights and “lead to large-scale dis­place­ment”, the state govern­ment said.</p>
    <p>The Ma­ha­rash­tra state govern­ment also ob­jected to the in­clu­sion of a coal mine that lies within a tiger re­serve. In mid-July, the cen­tral govern­ment with­drew this coal block from the list.</p>
    <p>Also, nine vil­lage lead­ers from an­other small coal-rich state, Ch­hat­tis­garh, wrote to Mr Modi de­mand­ing a stop to the auc­tion of coal blocks in the bio­di­ver­si­tyrich 420,000-acre Has­deo Arand for­est. Af­ter a meet­ing with state govern­ment of­fi­cials last month, Mr Joshi said five blocks in ecosen­si­tive ar­eas would be re­moved from the auc­tion list, and three oth­ers added.</p>
    <p>Coal-fired plants make up 55 per cent of In­dia’s in­stalled power ca­pac­ity, and ac­count for 80 per cent of all in­dus­trial emis­sions. De­spite a push for re­new­able en­ergy to make up 40 per cent of the en­ergy mix by 2040, ex­perts say the auc­tions send a strong sig­nal about In­dia’s de­pen­dence on coal.</p>
    <p>They note that global in­vestors have been ex­it­ing coal min­ing in re­cent years, and many fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions have in­sti­tuted coal pol­icy re­stric­tions due to pres­sure from cli­mate change ac­tivists. More­over, In­dia’s coal has a lower calorific value and the ash con­tent can go as high as 35 per cent.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial in Jhark­hand’s coal de­part­ment said it was con­cerned that “the pre­vail­ing poor eco­nomic con­di­tions un­der the pan­demic” could also lead to lower bids from com­pa­nies and a sig­nif­i­cant loss in rev­enue for the state, but Mr Joshi has dis­missed these fears as “un­founded”.</p>
