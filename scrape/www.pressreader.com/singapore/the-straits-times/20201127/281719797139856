    <p>Malaysia has im­posed manda­tory Covid-19 screen­ing for 1.7 mil­lion for­eign work­ers in view of the high num­ber of cases in­volv­ing the group.</p>
    <p>And from yes­ter­day, the au­thor­i­ties will start im­pos­ing a fine of RM50,000 (S$16,000) per worker if em­ploy­ers house their for­eign work­ers in crowded spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob, who an­nounced this, said the first phase of Covid-19 screen­ing in­volv­ing 888,342 for­eign work­ers will be car­ried out in Se­lan­gor, Labuan, Kuala Lumpur, Pe­nang and Negeri Sem­bi­lan.</p>
    <p>“The Hu­man Re­sources Min­istry will start en­forc­ing the Work­ers’ Min­i­mum Stan­dards of Hous­ing and Ameni­ties Act 1990 begin­ning to­mor­row (Thurs­day). Em­ploy­ers who flout the reg­u­la­tions will be fined RM50,000 per worker,” he said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>He called on em­ploy­ers to take the ini­tia­tive to get their work­ers to un­dergo Covid-19 tests, with­out wait­ing for a di­rec­tive from the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“It is bet­ter to test early and pay the bill rather than wait for the dis­ease to spread, as fac­tory op­er­a­tors will suf­fer greater losses when their premises are forced to shut down to con­tain the spread of Covid-19,” he said.</p>
    <p>As for the manda­tory screen­ing in phases, the So­cial Se­cu­rity Or­gan­i­sa­tion will pay RM60 per em­ployee for the rapid anti­gen test.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Is­mail Sabri said it would be a great chal­lenge even if only 1 per cent of the for­eign work­ers tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Where are we go­ing to place them?” he asked.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter said Top Glove is the sin­gle big­gest con­trib­u­tor to the coun­try’s Covid-19 cases, ac­count­ing for 1,511 cases of the 2,188 new in­fec­tions recorded na­tion­wide on Tues­day. “Of the 1,623 pos­i­tive cases recorded in Se­lan­gor, 1,511 are for­eign work­ers em­ployed at Top Glove.”</p>
    <p>He said that of the com­pany’s 28 fac­to­ries, 27 had been or­dered closed, while an­other would be or­dered to close pend­ing Covid-19 screen­ing of all its em­ploy­ees and a 14-day quar­an­tine or­der.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, Top Glove em­ployed 11,215 work­ers. Un­til Nov 25, a to­tal of 5,795 screen­ing tests had been con­ducted, of which 2,684 had re­turned pos­i­tive.”</p>
    <p>Mr Is­mail Sabri said the au­thor­i­ties had im­posed an en­hanced move­ment con­trol or­der at the male and fe­male hos­tels with ef­fect from Nov 17.</p>
    <p>“And some 2,263 of its work­ers who are not stay­ing in the hos­tels would also be quar­an­tined.</p>
    <p>“Res­i­dents nearby need not worry as all work­ers are screened and placed in quar­an­tine cen­tres, in­clud­ing the Gold Coast ho­tel in Klang Sen­tral and a sta­dium in Pan­dama­ran.”</p>
    <p>He said a task force had been set up to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion at Top Glove fac­to­ries. The task force com­prises the Se­lan­gor Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, state Health De­part­ment, Klang District Of­fice, Klang Mu­nic­i­pal Coun­cil and Klang po­lice.</p>
    <p>“The Health Min­istry and the task force will con­tinue mon­i­tor­ing and as­sess­ing the sit­u­a­tion from time to time,” he added.</p>
