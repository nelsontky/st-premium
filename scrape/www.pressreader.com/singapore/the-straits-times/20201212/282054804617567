    <p>In­done­sia’s fail­ure to re­duce the num­ber of Covid-19 cases nine months af­ter declar­ing its first cases in March re­flects its slow and poor re­sponses to the spread of the pan­demic. Its han­dling of the virus has taken a toll on the coun­try’s global rep­u­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Since March, Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo has is­sued many poli­cies in re­sponse to the pan­demic, such as en­forc­ing a par­tial lock­down, en­cour­ag­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing and al­lo­cat­ing a spe­cial bud­get for Covid-19 re­sponses. How­ever, in fo­cus­ing more on eco­nomic sta­bil­ity than pub­lic health, the gov­ern­ment’s pol­icy ap­proach has raised con­cerns about the fail­ure to con­tain the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Hu­man Rights Watch says In­done­sia’s gov­ern­ment is fail­ing to pro­vide trans­par­ent ac­cess to in­for­ma­tion to bat­tle the Covid-19 out­break. The cap­i­tal, Jakarta, has failed to pro­vide pre­cise data on how many cases it has.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the au­thor­i­ties are us­ing In­done­sia’s long-abused crim­i­nal defama­tion laws to si­lence pub­lic crit­i­cism of the gov­ern­ment’s re­sponse to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A re­port by the Carnegie En­dow­ment for In­ter­na­tional Peace, a non-par­ti­san for­eign pol­icy think-tank, shows that mis­placed pri­or­i­ties and dis­trust of data have con­trib­uted to In­done­sia’s fail­ures to con­tain the spread of coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The nar­ra­tives sur­round­ing In­done­sia’s in­abil­ity to deal with the pan­demic have dam­aged the coun­try’s image glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The 2020 Asia Power In­dex sur­vey, re­leased by the Syd­ney-based Lowy In­sti­tute, found In­done­sia’s diplo­matic in­flu­ence fell by 5.2 per cent due to its poor han­dling of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It said as many as 95 per cent of peo­ple in Aus­tralia doubt the In­done­sian Pres­i­dent’s abil­ity to han­dle global is­sues such as the pan­demic Th­ese kinds of doubts could af­fect In­done­sia’s tourism, trade and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>The safest bet</p>
    <p>Editorial</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Daily In­quirer, The Philip­pines</p>
    <p>The clar­i­fi­ca­tion came two days af­ter In­te­rior Sec­re­tary Ed­uardo Ano cre­ated con­fu­sion when he stated that chil­dren may soon be al­lowed to leave their homes, and go to the malls, un­der gen­eral com­mu­nity quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tive was met with cau­tion, par­tic­u­larly from health ex­perts who warned that chil­dren and young adults may be key to spread­ing the virus. It could even be fa­tal if they live with se­nior cit­i­zens and bring the virus home.</p>
    <p>Re­cent stud­ies have also de­bunked ear­lier the­o­ries that chil­dren are less sus­cep­ti­ble to in­fec­tion and trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>But it’s not only mi­nors who can be su­per spread­ers. Adults who dis­re­gard health pro­to­cols could spread the virus too, like what hap­pened in Su­bic, where a surge in in­fec­tions last month was traced to em­ploy­ees who at­tended two par­ties where they did not wear face masks or ob­serve phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing. The in­fected em­ploy­ees, re­ports said, were also not hon­est with their health dec­la­ra­tion and con­tin­ued re­port­ing for work, even­tu­ally ex­pos­ing their co-work­ers.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage re­mains clear, both for adults and mi­nors: Un­less it’s ab­so­lutely nec­es­sary, con­tinue to stay home.</p>
    <p>M.C. Hughes</p>
    <p>China Daily (Asia), Hong Kong</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is miss­ing a trick if it ne­glects to seize upon an ob­vi­ous op­por­tu­nity to re­gain the con­fi­dence of the very peo­ple it swore to serve.</p>
    <p>The va­lid­ity of im­ple­ment­ing yet an­other com­mu­nity-wide test­ing scheme must be ques­tioned, be­cause if it is any­thing like the one in Septem­ber, then it is doomed to fail.</p>
    <p>But if we can lever­age tech­nol­ogy into com­mu­nity test­ing schemes, per­haps we can turn the tide, even just a lit­tle bit.</p>
    <p>The new test-and-trace mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion “LeaveHomeS­afe” has been de­vel­oped by the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment with the in­ten­tion of al­low­ing more ef­fi­cient iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of chains of in­fec­tion around the city. Users can sim­ply open the app to scan the QR code of par­tic­i­pat­ing venues to mark their visit.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are some glar­ingly ob­vi­ous is­sues with the scheme. For one thing, not all venues are re­quired to carry the “LeaveHomeS­afe” QR code, and vis­i­tors are not law­fully re­quired to check-in at par­tic­i­pat­ing venues.</p>
    <p>With that in mind, in the event that an out­break is iden­ti­fied at a par­tic­u­lar venue, how can we be sure that each and ev­ery per­son who vis­ited said venue has been con­tacted? This means that asymp­to­matic car­ri­ers re­main uniden­ti­fied within the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>If we wield tech­nolo­gies such as “LeaveHomeS­afe” prop­erly, then we can use it to reach more of the com­mu­nity and get them tested.</p>
    <p>Zahid Hus­sain Dawn, Pak­istan</p>
    <p>Noth­ing could be more ridicu­lous than us­ing the gov­ern­ment’s cal­lous­ness as jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for the op­po­si­tion’s reck­less­ness.</p>
    <p>It is true that the gov­ern­ment, too, is play­ing pol­i­tics with the pan­demic and is not se­ri­ous in deal­ing with the cri­sis. But does this val­i­date ir­re­spon­si­ble be­hav­iour from the other side on what­ever pre­text? Hu­man lives are more im­por­tant than this inane game of po­lit­i­cal point-scor­ing.</p>
    <p>In the midst of this power game, the bat­tle against the ram­pag­ing con­ta­gion seems to have lost its fo­cus. Prime Min­is­ter Im­ran Khan, who is claim­ing credit for ef­fec­tively con­tain­ing the first wave of the pan­demic and at the same time keep­ing the econ­omy afloat, seems too busy fighting the op­po­si­tion to fo­cus on this more se­ri­ous is­sue.</p>
    <p>The wors­en­ing po­lit­i­cal con­fronta­tion has also af­fected all ef­forts to for­mu­late a na­tional strat­egy to fight the sec­ond wave. Each prov­ince is go­ing its own way.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, the op­po­si­tion is flaunt­ing the gov­ern­ment’s in­ep­ti­tude to ra­tio­nalise its own de­fi­ance. There is an ironic shift in their re­spec­tive po­si­tions on bat­tling the con­ta­gion. While the Prime Min­is­ter had ve­he­mently op­posed a lock­down dur­ing the first wave, the op­po­si­tion was shout­ing from the rooftops call­ing for a to­tal shut­down. Now there is a com­plete turn­around in the op­po­si­tion’s stance.</p>
    <p>The ruth­less power game is tak­ing the coun­try to the precipice.</p>
