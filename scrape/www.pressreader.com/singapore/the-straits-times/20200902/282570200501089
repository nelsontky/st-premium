    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The cast of ac­claimed po­lit­i­cal tele­vi­sion drama The West Wing will re­unite for a spe­cial episode in aid of former United States first lady Michelle Obama’s voter turnout drive, HBO Max an­nounced last week.</p>
    <p>Martin Sheen, Rob Lowe and Al­li­son Jan­ney will reprise their roles as mem­bers of a fic­tional Demo­cratic ad­min­is­tra­tion, in sup­port of the When We All Vote cam­paign ahead of Novem­ber’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The spe­cial – to air later this year – will be filmed on a Los An­ge­les the­atre stage, and will re-en­act the Harts­field’s Land­ing episode from sea­son three of the mul­ti­ple Emmy-win­ning NBC drama.</p>
    <p>It will be the first time that the orig­i­nal, sur­viv­ing cast and creator Aaron Sorkin have re­united in 17 years, a state­ment from stream­ing plat­form HBO Max said.</p>
    <p>“We had such a unique and won­der­ful ex­pe­ri­ence that we don’t want to go back and have a lesser ver­sion of it,” Bradley Whit­ford, who played ra­zor-sharp White House deputy chief of staff Josh Ly­man, told NBC’s To­day Show.</p>
    <p>“This was a way to use us get­ting back to­gether... to make a state­ment about get­ting peo­ple out to vote.”</p>
    <p>The show ran from 1999 to 2006, col­lect­ing 26 Em­mys, in­clud­ing four con­sec­u­tive Best Drama prizes.</p>
    <p>It de­picted the in­ner work­ings of the White House, fo­cus­ing on the re­la­tion­ships among staffers against a back­drop of Wash­ing­ton in­trigue, do­mes­tic elec­tions and geopol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>The West Wing de­vel­oped an al­most cult fol­low­ing and gripped au­di­ences around the world, but ended af­ter its sev­enth sea­son amid de­clin­ing view­er­ship and the death of co-star John Spencer.</p>
    <p>The show’s por­trayal of a fiercely in­tel­lec­tual and morally vir­tu­ous Demo­cratic pres­i­dent (Sheen) was crit­i­cised by some on the po­lit­i­cal right, who dubbed it “The Left Wing.”</p>
    <p>The Harts­field’s Land­ing episode saw Whit­ford’s char­ac­ter scheme to win over vot­ers in a re­mote, fic­tional New Hamp­shire town of the same name, where bal­lots are counted im­me­di­ately and al­ways pre­dict the win­ner of that state’s pri­mary.</p>
    <p>When We All Vote is an outreach group co-chaired by Mrs Obama, ac­tor Tom Hanks and oth­ers to in­crease par­tic­i­pa­tion at the US polls.</p>
