    <p>The Lim Chu Kang area looks set to be trans­formed into Sin­ga­pore’s food bowl as the coun­try ramps up its drive to pro­duce more food lo­cally as a buf­fer against global sup­ply shocks.</p>
    <p>About 390ha of land there will be re­de­vel­oped un­der a mas­ter­plan to cre­ate a “high-tech, highly pro­duc­tive and re­source-ef­fi­cient agri­food clus­ter”, the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The re­de­vel­op­ment will see the Lim Chu Kang area – cur­rently home to a num­ber of tra­di­tional farms – more than triple its cur­rent food pro­duc­tion, it added.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, an av­er­age veg­etable farm here oc­cu­pies around 2ha of land and pro­duces about 130 tonnes of veg­eta­bles per hectare ev­ery year. But the SFA said a high­tech veg­etable farm could pro­duce more than 1,000 tonnes ev­ery year, with less than 1ha of land.</p>
    <p>SFA will con­sult stake­hold­ers such as farm­ers on the de­vel­op­ment of the mas­ter­plan over the next two to three years.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ment works are ex­pected to com­mence in 2024 and will be car­ried out in phases, the SFA added in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>All farms cur­rently in Lim Chu Kang will be able to stay on un­til the end of their leases, the SFA said.</p>
    <p>Ten food farms and 13 non-food farms, whose leases are ex­pir­ing be­tween this year and 2022, will be of­fered a short-ten­ancy ex­ten­sion, af­ter which the land will be re­de­vel­oped in line with the mas­ter­plan.</p>
    <p>One food farm and two non-food farms whose leases are ex­pir­ing be­tween 2026 and 2027 will be al­lowed to con­tinue un­til their leases ex­pire, said the agency.</p>
    <p>The SFA and the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) will work closely with these farms to sup­port their tran­si­tion plans. Some non-food farms, such as or­na­men­tal fish farms and nurs­eries, fall un­der the purview of NParks.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore cur­rently pro­duces less than 10 per cent of the food it needs, although the plan is to boost this to 30 per cent by 2030.</p>
    <p>“The on­go­ing Covid-19 global pan­demic has un­der­scored the im­por­tance of en­sur­ing that we have diver­si­fied sources and re­silient food sup­ply chains,” added the SFA.</p>
    <p>The re­de­vel­op­ment of Lim Chu Kang will help the agri-food sec­tor de­velop sus­tain­able, highly pro­duc­tive and in­dus­try-lead­ing farms of the fu­ture, strength­en­ing food se­cu­rity and cre­at­ing jobs, the SFA said.</p>
    <p>To this end, the food agency will look into the de­vel­op­ment of shared fa­cil­i­ties in the Lim Chu Kang area to lower costs of pro­duc­tion and re­source use, as well as put in place wa­ter, elec­tric­ity and trans­port in­fras­truc­ture to sup­port high-tech farm­ing sys­tems and at­tract a new gen­er­a­tion of agri-tech skilled work­ers.</p>
    <p>“We will also ex­plore how we can con­serve the use of re­sources and min­imise waste by adopt­ing cir­cu­lar econ­omy prin­ci­ples,” it added.</p>
    <p>This could in­clude, for ex­am­ple, us­ing an­i­mal waste from one farm to gen­er­ate bio-gas for en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers yes­ter­day wel­comed news of the re­de­vel­op­ment of Lim Chu Kang, say­ing it could boost the in­fras­truc­ture needed for high­tech farm­ing in the area.</p>
    <p>The mas­ter­plan also showed that food se­cu­rity was an im­por­tant area for Sin­ga­pore, giv­ing farm­ers the as­sur­ance of mak­ing the in­vest­ments needed to scale up yield.</p>
    <p>One such farmer is Ms Jean</p>
    <p>Woon, 31, man­ager of Ser Poh Farm. Her 1.2ha beansprout farm will be mov­ing from Lim Chu Kang to a new plot in Sungei Ten­gah by the end of next year, with plans to dou­ble the farm’s cur­rent out­put through the use of tech­nol­ogy such as auto-ir­ri­ga­tion sys­tems.</p>
    <p>“Gov­ern­men­tal sup­port for the in­dus­try over these few years, such as the re­cently an­nounced mas­ter­plan and also in terms of fund­ing sup­port for use of tech­nol­ogy, gives us greater cer­tainty about the vi­a­bil­ity of the in­dus­try and gives us greater mo­ti­va­tion to in­vest,” she said.</p>
    <p>The SFA also said the Lim Chu Kang mas­ter­plan does not en­croach onto the re­cently an­nounced Sungei Bu­loh Na­ture Park Net­work, which in­cludes the bio­di­ver­sity hot spots of Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve and Kranji Marshes. The food agency will be con­duct­ing an en­vi­ron­men­tal study and will work with na­ture groups to bet­ter un­der­stand the ecosys­tem of flora and fauna in the area.</p>
    <p>The study is ex­pected to be com­pleted in the mid­dle of next year, and find­ings will be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion as part of its mas­ter­plan ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity food ex­pert Wil­liam Chen, the Michael Fam Chair Pro­fes­sor in food sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy, said a tech-driven farm­ing sys­tem is key for the fu­ture as it would make the food pro­duc­tion sys­tem more re­silient to ex­ter­nal fac­tors, whether pan­demics or cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, it would make the food sup­ply chain less de­pen­dent on cur­rent ma­jor food-pro­duc­ing coun­tries,” he said.</p>
