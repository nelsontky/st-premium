    <p>Af­ter see­ing his side drop six points in four Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL) games and lose top scorer Jor­dan Webb through a red card in their last match, Tampines Rovers coach Gavin Lee urged his play­ers to stay calm amid the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Last night, the Stags re­sponded with a straight­for­ward 2-0 win over Hougang United at Hougang Sta­dium to stay two points be­hind lead­ers Al­birex Ni­igata, who beat the Young Lions by the same score at Jurong East.</p>
    <p>In Webb’s ab­sence, Boris Ko­pi­tovic picked up the scor­ing slack and pounced at the back post to stab home the opener af­ter Bai­hakki Khaizan had flicked on Zehrudin Mehme­dovic’s 22nd­minute cor­ner.</p>
    <p>Hougang were also miss­ing their im­ports, as de­fender Zac An­der­son and mid­fielder Char­lie Machell were left out of the side. The duo de­clined to ex­tend their con­tract be­yond Nov 30 to see out the sea­son, which was de­layed due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With an all-lo­cal line-up, the Chee­tahs’ phys­i­cal pres­ence suf­fered as Bai­hakki tow­ered over Afiq Noor for the opener. They also missed Machell’s free-kick ex­per­tise, although they did not win many in the dan­ger ar­eas this time.</p>
    <p>Hougang coach Cle­ment Teo, whose side have now lost three on the spin to fall to sixth and lose ground in the fight for an AFC Cup spot, said: “The de­ci­sion was made when the up­dated fix­tures came out in Oc­to­ber. We need to look ahead and pre­pare for the two games they will not be avail­able for.</p>
    <p>“I thought our lo­cal boys showed their ca­pa­bil­i­ties. An­ders Aplin did well against Boris and I’m happy with how we played against a strong side. We will come back stronger against Tan­jong Pa­gar on Saturday.”</p>
    <p>On the other hand, it was the Tampines re­serves who im­pressed. Winger Dan­ish Sire­gar was lively and should have scored his first SPL goal in the 28th minute, but the ball flashed wide af­ter he com­bined well with Mehme­dovic.</p>
    <p>His re­place­ment Tau­fik Su­parno went one bet­ter. Af­ter com­ing on for the sec­ond half, the 25-year-old took just 36 sec­onds to ex­tend Tampines’ lead and seal the three points.</p>
    <p>The Stags threat­ened to score more, but found goal­keeper Rid­huan Barudin in good form as Tau</p>
    <p>FI­NAL PUSH</p>
    <p>We recog­nise the stakes are high at this stage of the sea­son, we need to win ev­ery game to win the ti­tle, and we re­bounded well tonight. It is up to us to fig­ure out how to keep it up for the last three games.</p>
    <p>fik and Kyoga Naka­mura’s shots were well saved.</p>
    <p>Lee said: “It wasn’t easy to play two games in 72 hours (af­ter the 2-2 draw with Tan­jong Pa­gar United on Sun­day), so credit to the boys for get­ting the job done on a heavy pitch.</p>
    <p>“We heard the ru­mours about Hougang, but we can fo­cus only on our­selves. I’m happy with how our boys stepped up. Peo­ple see Tau­fik’s goal, but they should also look at the de­fen­sive work he put in with Ir­wan Shah on the left that even­tu­ally led to the goal.</p>
    <p>“We recog­nise the stakes are high at this stage of the sea­son, we need to win ev­ery game to win the ti­tle, and we re­bounded well tonight. It is up to us to fig­ure out how to keep it up for the last three games.”</p>
    <p>In last night’s other match, the Lion City Sailors re­main third af­ter</p>
    <p>beat­ing fourth-placed Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional 3-0 at Our Tampines Hub, while fifth-placed Balestier Khalsa were held 2-2 by bot­tom side Tan­jong Pa­gar at Bis­han Sta­dium.</p>
