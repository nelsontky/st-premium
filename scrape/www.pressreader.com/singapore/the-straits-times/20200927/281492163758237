    <p>The pan­demic has brought thou­sands of over­seas Sin­ga­pore­ans home abruptly as they seek shel­ter from the Covid-19 storm. The Sun­day Times speaks to Sin­ga­pore­ans who have built their lives and ca­reers over­seas as some find com­fort in be­ing home and oth­ers deal with job losses and other anx­i­eties aris­ing from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>As the Covid-19 out­break swept across the United States in early March, Sin­ga­porean Melinda Lauw thought she could hun­ker down and wait it out.</p>
    <p>But when the coro­n­avirus started rav­aging New York state, where she and her hus­band lived, she found her­self fur­loughed in­def­i­nitely from her job as an ex­pe­ri­ence de­signer in an en­ter­tain­ment com­pany.</p>
    <p>Ms Lauw and her hus­band are among the thou­sands of over­seas Sin­ga­pore­ans who have re­turned to Sin­ga­pore af­ter fac­ing fur­loughs, salary cuts and re­trench­ments ow­ing to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures re­leased last week by the Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics show that the num­ber of over­seas Sin­ga­pore­ans de­creased from 217,200 last year to 203,500 this year, with the pan­demic cited as a fac­tor.</p>
    <p>“(Be­fore this) it to­tally did not cross our minds that we would have to move back to Sin­ga­pore this year. The pan­demic forced our hand,” said Ms Lauw, 28, who had been in the United States for the past five years.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple were also wor­ried about con­tract­ing Covid-19 and the lack of proper med­i­cal in­sur­ance in the US, so they re­turned in April.</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter, Ms Lauw’s hus­band, who had con­tin­ued work­ing re­motely from Sin­ga­pore in his USbased mar­ket­ing job in the tech sec­tor, was re­trenched. And she de­cided to quit her job to fo­cus on find­ing new ca­reer op­por­tu­ni­ties here.</p>
    <p>Like Ms Lauw, 24-year-old Ng Jing Wen was fur­loughed in March, af­ter spend­ing more than three years work­ing her way up the ranks in the kitchen of a two-Miche­lin-starred restau­rant in Man­hat­tan. She had just been pro­moted to sous-chef.</p>
    <p>“I thought I had fi­nally found some sta­bil­ity, but that all changed be­cause of Covid-19,” said Ms Ng.</p>
    <p>Eater­ies there first closed in early March as New York went into lock­down. But as Ms Ng’s weeks of fur­lough turned into months, she re­ceived word that she and 50 oth­ers from the restau­rant’s main group would be laid off.</p>
    <p>“I re­alised that at a time like this, it would be bet­ter to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore to find a job,” said Ms Ng, who re­turned last month and is still look­ing for em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>SE­CU­RITY OF HOME</p>
    <p>Fig­ures re­leased last week by the Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics show that the num­ber of over­seas Sin­ga­pore­ans de­creased from 217,200 last year to 203,500 this year, with the pan­demic cited as a fac­tor.</p>
    <p>With many coun­tries pri­ori­tis­ing their cit­i­zens amid mas­sive job losses, over­seas Sin­ga­pore­ans see bet­ter ca­reer prospects back home.</p>
    <p>Also, said Ms Lauw, who is liv­ing with her par­ents, “if you do get Covid-19 here, you will def­i­nitely be able to get treat­ment and it’s not go­ing to cost you a crazy amount. And you have the fam­ily sup­port to ride out th­ese un­cer­tain times”.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity of home was also what drew Mr Jeremy Au, 33, and his preg­nant wife home in early March, af­ter liv­ing in the US since 2015.</p>
    <p>He said: “My judg­ment was that the sit­u­a­tion in New York was go­ing to get much worse. We knew the virus would af­fect our daily lives, so we de­cided to ride it out with fam­ily back in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>He con­tin­ued to work re­motely – as the ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of an Amer­i­can ed­u­ca­tion firm that had ac­quired his start-up – be­fore quit­ting last month.</p>
    <p>He and his wife, who are ex­pect­ing a baby in De­cem­ber, al­ways in­tended to re­turn to Sin­ga­pore “even­tu­ally”, but the pan­demic ex­pe­dited their home­com­ing.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic also brought Mr Chan Joo Kwang, 42, and his fam­ily home from Hong Kong ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>He and his wife are now re­motely run­ning the health­care con­sult­ing com­pany they co-founded there. They have two chil­dren, a three­year-old and a 10-month-old.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has played around with our plans. But we are look­ing for­ward to re­main­ing here for a while,” Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, re­cruiters here have no­ticed a trend among re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans: Those who are still work­ing re­motely for over­seas em­ploy­ers are seek­ing to make their re­lo­ca­tion to Sin­ga­pore more per­ma­nent and find jobs here.</p>
    <p>“As they spend a longer time back here than they have done in many years, they have the op­por­tu­nity to wit­ness the changes... and can see the avail­abil­ity of new and ex­cit­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties,” said Ms Elena Chow, founder of tal­ent con­sult­ing firm Con­nec­tOne, which spe­cialises in the tech and start-up sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Mr Au, for in­stance, has taken up a new role as a founder-in-res­i­dence at a Sin­ga­pore-based tal­ent ac­cel­er­a­tor. The role en­ables him to ex­plore new busi­ness ideas and build his third start-up ven­ture.</p>
    <p>“We re­alised that be­yond be­ing back home with fam­ily, there are many ca­reer and mar­ket op­por­tu­ni­ties here. Now, we are plan­ning to re­main in Sin­ga­pore,” said Mr Au, who is cur­rently liv­ing with his in-laws.</p>
    <p>For Kuala Lumpur-based Jovel Chan, 28, re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore is a chance to pick up new skills for the post-pan­demic world. She left her food and bev­er­age (F&B) mar­ket­ing job at an air­line last month and plans to re­lo­cate at the end of this month.</p>
    <p>She wants to re­main in Sin­ga­pore for at least four months to ex­plore the Skill­sFu­ture and SGUnited job op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able. She hopes that she can work over­seas again, even­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>“I don’t fore­see the air­line or F&B in­dus­tries pick­ing up soon, so I felt it’s time to pick up new skills,” said Ms Chan, who wants to gain ex­pe­ri­ence in the food sci­ence and food tech­nol­ogy sec­tors. “The pan­demic has cer­tainly changed my ca­reer path and my short-term plans.”</p>
    <p>For some, Changi Busi­ness Park has been re­ferred to as “Chen­nai Busi­ness Park” due to the num­ber of In­dian ex­pa­tri­ates work­ing there.</p>
    <p>In re­cent weeks, so­cial me­dia posts have tar­geted some firms – in­clud­ing those at the busi­ness park – over hir­ing prac­tices, which they claim ap­pear to favour some na­tion­al­i­ties ahead of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>The mat­ter prompted Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat to ac­knowl­edge last month that some may feel there are too many for­eign­ers re­sid­ing here, cit­ing res­i­dents’ con­cerns about the large num­ber of ex­pa­tri­ates at Changi Busi­ness Park. He ex­plained that the Repub­lic was still grow­ing ex­per­tise in cer­tain sec­tors.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic-in­duced down­turn has cast the spot­light on the lo­cal-for­eigner divide, as Sin­ga­pore­ans face a higher risk of be­ing laid off and per­ceive for­eign­ers to be com­pet­ing for the same jobs.</p>
    <p>COM­PET­ING WITH LO­CALS</p>
    <p>Yet job com­pe­ti­tion from for­eign­ers has been around for over three decades, when Sin­ga­pore made a de­lib­er­ate shift to sup­ple­ment its work­force with for­eign tal­ent.</p>
    <p>When the econ­omy is do­ing well and peo­ple are in sta­ble em­ploy­ment, for­eign­ers are seen “as be­ing less of a threat”, says Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) se­nior eco­nom­ics lec­turer Kelvin Seah.</p>
    <p>But in times of un­cer­tainty, neg­a­tive sen­ti­ment to­wards for­eign­ers tends to grow, as they are “per­ceived to be com­pet­ing with lo­cals for jobs and ca­reer pro­gres­sion”.</p>
    <p>This comes as the job mar­ket starts to feel the full force of the coro­n­avirus cri­sis. Al­ready, 11,350 peo­ple have been laid off in the first half of the year, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said on Sept 14. It is the worst show­ing since the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis of 2009.</p>
    <p>It does not help that the size­able num­ber of for­eign­ers here makes Sin­ga­pore­ans more aware of their pres­ence, says Dr Seah.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s non-res­i­dent pop­u­la­tion is 1.64 mil­lion, and of this num­ber, 190,000 are Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) hold­ers and 189,000 are S Pass hold­ers, as of June, ac­cord­ing to MOM.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Uni­ver­sity of So­cial Sci­ences economist Wal­ter Th­e­seira says the sit­u­a­tion re­flects the down­side of a lib­eral for­eign em­ploy­ment pol­icy: “There’s no need to com­plain about some­one else hav­ing a slice of your pie when it’s grow­ing and you can also have a big­ger slice; when that pie is shrink­ing, you pay ex­tra at­ten­tion to how to divide what’s left.”</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity is that a small coun­try like Sin­ga­pore has to bring in for­eign tal­ent – par­tic­u­larly with the kind of ex­per­tise needed by growth in­dus­tries – to at­tract in­ter­na­tional firms and stay com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>Peo­pleWorld­wide Con­sult­ing man­ag­ing direc­tor David Leong notes: “Th­ese in­vest­ments must mean that the se­nior man­age­ment may be filled by for­eign­ers, since they need their for­eign man­age­ment’s con­ti­nu­ity.”</p>
    <p>This presents a dilemma in re­cent times, as Sin­ga­pore­ans now – be­ing more aca­dem­i­cally qual­i­fied – be­lieve they are ca­pa­ble enough to take up those roles.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem points out how Sin­ga­pore­ans may not feel bad about blue-col­lared jobs go­ing to for­eign­ers. “It’s only the jobs which they de­sire, are well qual­i­fied for and gen­er­ally highly sought af­ter, that lo­cals are up­set they are los­ing those op­por­tu­ni­ties to for­eign tal­ent.”</p>
    <p>The city-state’s low fer­til­ity rate has also left it with “no choice” but to sup­ple­ment its scarce lo­cal work­force with for­eign tal­ent to thrive eco­nom­i­cally, says Ms Low.</p>
    <p>To en­sure a crit­i­cal mass of Sin­ga­pore­ans is main­tained in the labour force, Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal fer­til­ity rate has to rise. But this has dipped from 1.82 in 1980 to 1.14 last year, which is among the low­est in the world.</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies se­nior re­search fel­low Mathew Mathews says many lo­cals are aware of the in­evitable need for for­eign tal­ent.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, when­ever there are eco­nomic down­turns, this is­sue be­comes salient. Some will start con­test­ing the premise that for­eign man­power is in­deed help­ful.”</p>
    <p>In the wake of ma­jor re­trench­ments in re­cent months, so­cial me­dia posts high­light­ing prac­tices that sup­pos­edly favour some for­eign­ers have been more ap­par­ent.</p>
    <p>But some com­men­ta­tors have been lax about fact-check­ing.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a post last month in­cluded a photo pur­port­edly taken at DBS Bank’s IT depart­ment at its Asia Hub in Changi Busi­ness Park. The bank later clar­i­fied that the im­age was taken in its In­dia of­fice.</p>
    <p>The commentato­r, when con­tacted about the post and if he had made the ef­fort to ver­ify the source of the im­age, replied by ask­ing why he should have to do such checks.</p>
    <p>NUS so­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser ex­plains that Sin­ga­pore­ans have been brought up to be­lieve in mer­i­toc­racy. But when they are con­vinced that there could be hir­ing prac­tices that priv­i­lege cer­tain na­tion­al­i­ties and their so­cial net­works, they would feel “short-changed in their own coun­try”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, Sin­ga­pore­ans want good jobs so they can have a cer­tain stan­dard of liv­ing and suf­fi­cient means to pro­vide for their own needs.</p>
    <p>Some Sin­ga­pore­ans may well raise the dif­fi­cul­ties they have had to go through to get bet­ter jobs, such as a gru­elling ed­u­ca­tion sys</p>
    <p>tem, and na­tional ser­vice for males, says Dr Mathews. “There is then a per­cep­tion that hav­ing put in all this ef­fort, the na­tion should not un­fairly un­der­mine this by al­low­ing easy ac­cess to for­eign­ers who have not made such sac­ri­fices.”</p>
    <p>On the flip­side, some ex­pa­tri­ates here fear los­ing their jobs, amid calls for firms to re­tain cit­i­zens over for­eign­ers if lay­offs can­not be avoided.</p>
    <p>A 32-year-old Malaysian, who works as a project man­ager at a lo­gis­tics firm, is tak­ing it one day at a time.</p>
    <p>“No one knows when the pan­demic would end. Ev­ery day, our jobs are at risk,” he adds. “We, too, are just try­ing to make a liv­ing.”</p>
    <p>THE WAY FOR­WARD</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have been tak­ing bold steps in re­cent years to en­sure Sin­ga­pore­ans are fairly treated, with the lat­est tight­en­ing of work pass re­quire­ments one of sev­eral moves to re­cal­i­brate for­eign work­force poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Last month, MOM raised the salary thresh­olds for EPs, with a higher bar for fi­nan­cial ser­vices, and for S Passes, a move likely to push em­ploy­ers to hire more lo­cals.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers em­pha­sise that be­ing in­ward-look­ing is not the way for­ward.</p>
    <p>Dr Seah says it would bode well for Sin­ga­pore if pol­i­cy­mak­ers con­sider the is­sue from a fresh per­spec­tive. “We need to re­mem­ber that</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is at­trac­tive to in­ter­na­tional com­pa­nies for a va­ri­ety of rea­sons, not just be­cause of the flex­i­bil­ity to em­ploy for­eign labour.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Tan notes that the way to pro­tect the Sin­ga­porean core is not to prac­tise pro­tec­tion­ism, but to help more Sin­ga­pore­ans rise up by ac­quir­ing in-de­mand ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Th­e­seira says “there is no glob­ally suc­cess­ful city that does not use mi­gra­tion” to ex­pand the quan­tity and qual­ity of its work­force.</p>
    <p>While it is pos­si­ble to just adopt a low mi­gra­tion pol­icy, Sin­ga­pore would be left with a de­clin­ing labour force due to the age­ing pop­u­la­tion, and be “lim­ited to only the skills we can train from the lo­cal pop­u­la­tion”, he adds.</p>
    <p>“The trade-off would be that we likely would have to ac­cept a shrink­ing econ­omy, which would re­quire sig­nif­i­cant adap­ta­tion from Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
