    <p>Newly elected MP Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) ar­gued yes­ter­day that it was time to in­ject more com­pas­sion into govern­ment pol­i­cy­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim, who is em­ployed at Essec Busi­ness School, noted that Sin­ga­pore has been a ste­ward of ra­tio­nal, ef­fi­cient pol­i­cy­mak­ing that has worked well over three gen­er­a­tions and brought the coun­try from Third World to First.</p>
    <p>And Sin­ga­pore­ans have ac­qui­esced to poli­cies of tough love, sac­ri­fic­ing in­di­vid­ual jus­tice for na­tional progress.</p>
    <p>But as Sin­ga­pore is “no longer a Third World na­tion, we can­not con­tinue to op­er­ate as if we are blind to the con­se­quences that tough-nosed poli­cies carry for our peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>“This is es­pe­cially so at a time where we need to help ev­ery­one pull in the same di­rec­tion for our col­lec­tive fu­ture,” he said in his maiden speech in Par­lia­ment dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim, who is a mem­ber of the Eco­nomic So­ci­ety of Sin­ga­pore’s coun­cil, noted that the gains from the progress over the years have not been equally shared across so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“It is, there­fore, un­de­ni­able that our ex­ist­ing ap­proach to pol­i­cy­mak­ing can ben­e­fit from a greater in­jec­tion of com­pas­sion and thought­ful­ness,” he said.</p>
    <p>He high­lighted two ex­ist­ing poli­cies that show Sin­ga­pore is ca­pa­ble of in­ject­ing com­pas­sion into its poli­cies: govern­ment fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance scheme ComCare, and the Kinder­garten Fee As­sis­tance Scheme that pro­vides sub­si­dies to par­ents of pre-school­ers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he added, other poli­cies could do with a heav­ier dose of com­pas­sion.</p>
    <p>He pro­posed that an of­fi­cial poverty line be in­tro­duced, linked closely to ComCare, and a min­i­mum wage be im­ple­mented across the board.</p>
    <p>He also sug­gested greater flex­i­bil­ity in ac­cess to Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund monies and an ex­panded cov­er­age of the Kinder­garten Fee As­sis­tance Scheme.</p>
    <p>Prof Lim ac­knowl­edged that the cur­rent cri­sis may not be the best time for en­act­ing such poli­cies that in­volve some de­gree of re­dis­tri­bu­tion, but called for the Govern­ment to com­mit to the prin­ci­ples of com­pas­sion­ate pol­i­cy­mak­ing now, and set out its plans.</p>
    <p>He said: “I be­lieve that we can be­come a bet­ter, richer so­ci­ety and coun­try – not just in ma­te­rial wealth, but in in­tel­lec­tual, so­ci­etal and spir­i­tual wealth. We can do so by em­brac­ing more com­pas­sion in our pol­i­cy­mak­ing.”</p>
