    <p>Ms Shyller Tan, 46, will never for­get the mo­ment on July 10, 2017 when her fa­ther told her he had killed her hus­band.</p>
    <p>Tan Nam Seng had phoned his daugh­ter min­utes af­ter he had knifed her hus­band, 39-year-old Spencer Tup­pani, in broad day­light along Boon Tat Street.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said she was driv­ing along the East Coast Park­way to work when she picked up the call.</p>
    <p>She “went hys­ter­i­cal”.</p>
    <p>Scream­ing and cry­ing, she rushed to the scene of the crime, where her fa­ther was await­ing ar­rest, she told The Straits Times in an in­ter­view at her home yes­ter­day af­ter his sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Her fore­most thoughts were for Tan, who was near­ing 70, and had not been him­self since he had learnt about her im­pend­ing di­vorce with Mr Tup­pani.</p>
    <p>He was un­der great strain, hav­ing found out that Mr Tup­pani, whom he treated as fam­ily, had a sec­ond fam­ily and may have been try­ing to usurp the busi­ness that Mr Tan had founded and en­trusted to him and his daugh­ters.</p>
    <p>“He loved us so much that he snapped.... no one wanted this to hap­pen,” said Ms Tan, who is now a stay-at-home mum.</p>
    <p>She said the fam­ily had not known about Mr Tup­pani’s sev­eral af­fairs, and his al­leged mis­use of com­pany funds for his lav­ish life­style, even though they had all lived in the same house in the east coast since their mar­riage in the mid-2000s</p>
    <p>Mr Tup­pani’s mother and younger brother, Ch­ester, also moved in sub­se­quently.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing seemed so per­fect,” said Ms Tan, whose chil­dren with Mr Tup­pani are now aged 13, 11 and nine.</p>
    <p>She said she found out about his mis­tress in Fe­bru­ary 2017 through a friend of his. She con­fronted her hus­band, who ad­mit­ted that he and the wo­man had two chil­dren, con­ceived through in-vitro fer­til­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said the rev­e­la­tion shocked her beyond be­lief. She later dis­cov­ered that her mother-in-law had also known about it, when friends sent her pic­tures of Mr Tup­pani and his mother cel­e­brat­ing a birth­day for one of his other chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“I felt to­tally de­ceived by her false pre­tences as she had kept it all from me,” said Ms Tan of her mother-in-law.</p>
    <p>The mis­tress has now filed a law­suit against Mr Tup­pani’s es­tate, to claw back over $3 mil­lion that she claimed was ei­ther bor­rowed from her by him, or was from their joint bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>Mr Tup­pani’s mother is also su­ing her fa­ther for de­pen­dency, said Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>Such or­deals have con­tin­ued to sur­face in the three years since she dis­cov­ered the af­fair and since her fa­ther’s at­tack on Mr Tup­pani, she added.</p>
    <p>“I have been un­der tremen­dous stress to keep my fam­ily in place,” said Ms Tan, adding that she is hon­est with her three chil­dren about what hap­pened. All three were present at Tan’s sen­tenc­ing yes­ter­day, and had pre­vi­ously writ­ten to the judge to ask for le­niency.</p>
    <p>She al­lows them to read news ar­ti­cles on the stab­bing, and said they fre­quently ask af­ter their grand­fa­ther. She said she tells them about how the com­pany was started, their fa­ther’s role in it, and how Tan was not in the right state of mind when he stabbed Mr Tup­pani.</p>
    <p>Tan was found to be suf­fer­ing from a ma­jor de­pres­sive dis­or­der that sig­nif­i­cantly impaired his men­tal re­spon­si­bil­ity for his ac­tions, and his mur­der charge was re­duced.</p>
    <p>Of the three chil­dren, the el­dest re­mem­bers their fa­ther best, Ms Tan said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan vis­its her fa­ther reg­u­larly in prison, tak­ing the chil­dren with her dur­ing the school hol­i­days. They do not talk about the fa­tal in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“Be­trayal is not an emo­tion that is easy to quell, and I too suf­fered many sleep­less nights, but can only imag­ine it must have been a frac­tion of what my dad went through,” said Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>They have be­gun plan­ning for Tan’s re­turn from prison. Ms Tan’s mother and a sis­ter have moved into their home. She and her sis­ter left the com­pany af­ter it was sold to lo­gis­tics firm GKE Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther’s sen­tence came as con­so­la­tion for them to close the chap­ter and “be­gin heal­ing”, said Ms Tan. “I just want all this to end.”</p>
    <p>I have been un­der tremen­dous stress to keep my fam­ily in place.</p>
    <p>MS SHYLLER TAN, who says she al­lows her three chil­dren, aged nine to 13, to read news ar­ti­cles on the stab­bing. All three were present at Tan Nam Seng’s sen­tenc­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
