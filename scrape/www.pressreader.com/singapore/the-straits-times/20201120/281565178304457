    <p>But in re­al­ity, over 100,000 more would have been in­fected as only about a fifth of peo­ple in­fected see a doc­tor and are di­ag­nosed, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang, pro­gramme leader for in­fec­tious dis­eases at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health.</p>
    <p>But those not di­ag­nosed can still pass the dis­ease on to oth­ers if bit­ten by a mosquito while in­fected.</p>
    <p>The high­est num­ber ever in­fected in a year pre­vi­ously was in 2013, when 22,170 peo­ple were di­ag­nosed with the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of weekly in­fec­tions peaked in July this year with 1,792 peo­ple di­ag­nosed in just one week – far more than the monthly to­tal in most years. Un­til this year, the largest num­ber of weekly in­fec­tions was 891 cases in 2014.</p>
    <p>There were also at least five su­per clus­ters with more than 300 peo­ple in­fected in each lo­ca­tion – some­thing that has hap­pened only once be­fore in 2014, and at only one lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Prior to this, the largest num­ber of peo­ple who died of dengue in a year was 25, in 2005. This year has not ended, and al­ready 29 peo­ple have died.</p>
    <p>Symp­toms of dengue in­clude nau­sea, vom­it­ing, a red rash, mus­cle and joint ache as well as pain be­hind the eyes. The more se­ri­ous dengue haem­or­rhagic fever causes bleed­ing in­ter­nally and ex­ter­nally.</p>
    <p>About one in five peo­ple di­ag­nosed with dengue here usu­ally ends up in hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>De­spite re­peated warn­ings by the NEA that Sin­ga­pore is fac­ing its big­gest ever dengue threat, thou­sands of cases of mosquito breed­ing in homes and pub­lic ar­eas con­tinue to be un­cov­ered by its of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>The NEA de­tected 6,800 breed­ing spots be­tween July and Septem­ber, with do­mes­tic con­tain­ers the most com­mon in homes, and dis­carded re­cep­ta­cles in pub­lic ar­eas.</p>
    <p>With the end of the usual peak dengue sea­son, which spans the hot and wet months of May to Oc­to­ber, the num­ber of weekly in­fec­tions will hope­fully taper off.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of di­ag­nosed cases has been de­clin­ing over the past four weeks, and stood at 355 cases last week.</p>
    <p>Another bright spot is the fall in the num­ber of peo­ple in­fected by Den-3.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple in­fected by dengue usu­ally be­come im­mune to the par­tic­u­lar strain they caught – more com­monly Den-1 and Den-2 here.</p>
    <p>Fewer peo­ple have im­mu­nity against Den-3 and Den-4.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary, Den-3 ac­counted for 47 per cent of in­fec­tions. This fell to 32 per cent in Septem­ber. The NEA said this is the first Den-3 out­break here in three decades.</p>
    <p>Al­though the num­ber of in­fec­tions is go­ing down, the NEA warned on its web­site: “The weekly num­ber of dengue cases con­tin­ues to re­main high, at about two times more than the num­ber of cases seen in the cor­re­spond­ing pe­riod av­er­aged over the last three years.</p>
    <p>“The adult Aedes ae­gypti mosquito pop­u­la­tion de­tected from the NEA’s Grav­i­t­rap sur­veil­lance sys­tem re­mains high in some ar­eas of Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
