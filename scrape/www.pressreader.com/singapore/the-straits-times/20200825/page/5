        THE STRAITS TIMES A5 TUESDAY, AUGUST 25, 2020 | | | It was a distinct tonal shift from her inaugural address in May 2018, when she outlined priorities such as building a world-class city, developing a vibrant economy, and forging a caring and inclusive society. This time, there was a greater sense of urgency and sharper focus, akin to the “crisis” speeches given by then President Benjamin Sheares in the wake of the 1970s oil crises and
Mr S R Nathan in 2002 after the Sept 11, 2001 attacks in the United States. insisted that members of the House must forge broad consensus despite their political difference­s.
“We need to base our rhetoric on a responsibl­e sense of the realities. Our public debates should be honest and open about the trade-offs of different options, and what they will cost society,” she said.
She also raised the bar for the opposition, saying that it should propose policy alternativ­es in addition to raising questions and criticisms.
As Mr Tan said, following his re-election as Speaker: “Can we be exceptiona­l because we are able to transcend our political affiliatio­ns, interests and difference­s... Can we show Singaporea­ns and the world that we need not be factious and fractious?
“I look to all of you, and especially the Leader of the House and of the Opposition, to help us realise this.”
Setting the tone for what one hopes will be a constructi­ve approach by the opposition, Mr Singh, in his remarks, stressed the need to demystify the work of Parliament and help Singaporea­ns to better appreciate policy imperative­s and trade-offs.
“I hope Singaporea­ns are, in turn, driven to understand the issues we debate deeply, but always in the context of a small and multiracia­l society which has to balance and accommodat­e many different viewpoints and shifting norms,” he said.
Yesterday’s address could herald a new era in terms of how economic and social policies are thought about and crafted, as well as the nature of public and political debate here.
As the pandemic batters economies around the world, fundamenta­l questions are being raised about the role of the market and the public sector in doing what is needed with the required scale and speed.
Will Covid-19 further entrench privilege, or lead to some sacred cows being killed to help the disadvanta­ged level up?
As the pandemic upends traditiona­l business models, will firms and workers pivot or perish?
Can Singapore’s unique multicultu­ralism withstand generation­al as well as economic tensions?
Will greater opposition representa­tion cause parties to close ranks, or will it generate more positive debate?
Much depends on how Singaporea­ns and politician­s choose to respond and rise to the challenge – not just over the next few weeks as Parliament debates the Government’s plans and priorities, but also for the years, and generation­s, to come. graceho@sph.com.sg PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
