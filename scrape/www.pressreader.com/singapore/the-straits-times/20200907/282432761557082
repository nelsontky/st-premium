    <p>Can­cer cells’ sur­face anti­gens would be al­to­gether dif­fer­ent from those of nor­mal cells in an­other body, as the two groups orig­i­nate from dif­fer­ent bod­ies. Con­ceal­ment from the other body’s im­mune sys­tem would be all but im­pos­si­ble and these can­cer cells would face cer­tain de­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>A pa­tient asked me: “Will I spread it to my fam­ily?”</p>
    <p>Given the at­ten­tion the coron­avirus pan­demic has at­tracted of late, you would likely think I was at­tend­ing to a Covid-19 pa­tient.</p>
    <p>I was not. The ques­tion came from a woman in her 50s who was re­cently di­ag­nosed with ad­vanced lung can­cer.</p>
    <p>You might think this ques­tion is silly. Is it not com­mon knowl­edge that can­cer is not con­ta­gious?</p>
    <p>In truth, ev­ery so of­ten, a pa­tient or his or her fam­ily will raise this con­cern with me dur­ing our con­sul­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>While most pa­tients would have heard of this fact at one point or an­other, nig­gling doubts some­how per­sist in their minds.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially true of pa­tients with ad­vanced can­cers that have spread widely through their bod­ies.</p>
    <p>They of­ten rea­son that, since the can­cer cells have the abil­ity to spread rapidly from one part of the body to an­other, there must be at least a re­mote chance that these cells may spread to an­other per­son in cer­tain cir­cum­stances such as sit­u­a­tions of in­ti­mate con­tact.</p>
    <p>Af­ter learn­ing that can­cer cells spread from one part of their bod­ies to an­other through the blood, pa­tients of­ten in­fer that their blood is “con­tam­i­nated” and if any­one else ac­ci­den­tally comes into con­tact with their blood, this hap­less per­son may con­tract can­cer.</p>
    <p>So, why does it not hap­pen? Sim­ply put, this is be­cause can­cer cells can fool the im­mune sys­tem of the pa­tient’s body, but not the im­mune sys­tem of an­other body.</p>
    <p>Can­cer cells are nor­mal cells that have mu­tated and picked up fright­en­ing abil­i­ties to rapidly mul­ti­ply and in­vade dif­fer­ent parts of the body.</p>
    <p>These cells are nor­mal cells that have gone rogue. Their mu­tated ap­pear­ances, in molec­u­lar terms, are some­what dif­fer­ent from nor­mal cells.</p>
    <p>Can­cer cells carry cer­tain ab­nor­mal pro­teins, known as anti­gens, on their sur­faces. The im­mune sys­tem can po­ten­tially recog­nise such dif­fer­ences and at­tack the ab­nor­mal can­cer cells.</p>
    <p>Can­cer cells, how­ever, de­velop the abil­ity to cam­ou­flage such dif­fer­ences – thus avoid­ing the on­slaught of the im­mune sys­tem – and sur­vive.</p>
    <p>To sur­vive in a body other than their body of ori­gin, can­cer cells would have to de­velop cam­ou­flage skills of a to­tally dif­fer­ent or­der.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, this is way be­yond their ken.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ences be­tween can­cer and nor­mal cells in the body of ori­gin are sub­tle. Af­ter all, both mu­tated can­cer cells and nor­mal cells orig­i­nate from the same mother cell.</p>
    <p>Most of the pro­teins on the sur­face of these can­cer cells, which give them their molec­u­lar sig­na­ture, are also sim­i­lar to those of nor­mal cells.</p>
    <p>While they are dif­fer­ent, can­cer cells, when min­gling among the nor­mal cells of the body, are akin to folks of the same race speak­ing the same lan­guage, but per­haps with a slightly dif­fer­ent ac­cent. This ac­cent can be con­cealed.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent strat­egy of us­ing the im­mune sys­tem to at­tack can­cer, known as im­munother­apy, hinges on coax­ing the im­mune sys­tem to recog­nise the sub­tle dif­fer­ences be­tween can­cer and nor­mal cells.</p>
    <p>Should can­cer cells from one body man­age to gain en­try into an­other body, they would be akin to for­eign­ers with a to­tally dif­fer­ent skin tone and hair colour, speak­ing in a for­eign tongue.</p>
    <p>Can­cer cells’ sur­face anti­gens would be al­to­gether dif­fer­ent from those of nor­mal cells in an­other body, as the two groups orig­i­nate from dif­fer­ent bod­ies. Con­ceal­ment from the other body’s im­mune sys­tem would be all but im­pos­si­ble and these can­cer cells would face cer­tain de­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>While can­cer cells can­not spread from per­son to per­son, can­cer-caus­ing genes can be passed from one gen­er­a­tion to the next. In­fec­tive agents that trig­ger can­cer for­ma­tion may also be passed from one per­son to the next.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, the gene BRCA, which is as­so­ci­ated with breast and ovary can­cers, made head­lines when Hol­ly­wood star An­gelina</p>
    <p>Jolie was re­vealed to have in­her­ited this gene from her mother, and de­cided to un­dergo pre-emp­tive surgery to re­move her breasts and ovaries.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore started the mass vac­ci­na­tion of sec­ondary-school girls against the hu­man pa­pil­lo­mavirus (HPV) in April last year. HPV in­fec­tion is strongly as­so­ci­ated with the sub­se­quent devel­op­ment of cer­vi­cal can­cer.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the pass­ing of hered­i­tary can­cer-caus­ing genes or can­cer-caus­ing in­fec­tions should not be con­fused with the spread of can­cer cells.</p>
    <p>This bears re­peat­ing: The spread of can­cer cells from one per­son to an­other is cat­e­gor­i­cally im­pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing the sci­en­tific ra­tio­nale for this will hope­fully put this myth to rest in peo­ple’s minds.</p>
    <p>Re­turn­ing to the topic of</p>
    <p>Covid-19 in­fec­tion, can­cer pa­tients un­der­go­ing treat­ment do have to take pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>They be­long to a vul­ner­a­ble group of peo­ple who are at greater risk of de­vel­op­ing se­vere com­pli­ca­tions, should they pick up the bug.</p>
    <p>Do re­mem­ber to stay away from crowds and wash your hands of­ten.</p>
