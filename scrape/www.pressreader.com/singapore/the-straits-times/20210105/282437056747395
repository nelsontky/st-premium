    <p>MIL­WAU­KEE • Mil­wau­kee and their high-pow­ered of­fence have set their sights on an Eastern Con­fer­ence team they have dom­i­nated over the past three sea­sons.</p>
    <p>The Bucks have won 11 straight games against Detroit, in­clud­ing the post­sea­son, ahead of their meet­ings yes­ter­day (9am Sin­ga­pore time) and to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Mil­wau­kee are off to a 3-3 start this sea­son but they con­tinue to lead the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) i n scor­ing (124.5 points per game) and three-point shoot­ing (43.9 per cent).</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the 2018-19 sea­son, the Bucks swept not only the fourgame reg­u­lar-sea­son se­ries but also the best-of-seven, first-round play­off. They swept them again last term, go­ing 3-0 against the Pis­tons, with two-time Most Valu­able Player Giannis An­te­tok­oun­mpo av­er­ag­ing 32 points, 11.7 re­bounds and 2.3 as­sists in those vic­to­ries.</p>
    <p>In the Bucks’ three wins this sea­son, they have av­er­aged 136 points and An­te­tok­oun­mpo is ea­ger to show they con­tinue to have Detroit’s num­ber.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, I want to be ag­gres­sive, ob­vi­ously I want to get in the paint,” the for­ward said. “But at the end of the day, I think my team­mates are open and I think in the long run, it’s go­ing to help me find my team­mates and fa­cil­i­tate for the team when I have to.”</p>
    <p>Bucks coach Mike Bu­den­holzer added: “We feel like we’ve added a lit­tle more shoot­ing depth, more guys who can make shots.</p>
    <p>“I just feel like Giannis is re­ally do­ing a great job of kind of be­ing a fa­cil­i­ta­tor, a point guard, find­ing shoot­ers and find­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Bryn Forbes is one of the bench play­ers they signed dur­ing the close sea­son.</p>
    <p>The guard inked a two-year con­tract as a free agent in Novem­ber af­ter spend­ing his first four sea­sons with the San An­to­nio Spurs.</p>
    <p>De­spite his short time on the ros­ter, he be­lieves his team­mates are bring­ing the best out of him.</p>
    <p>“I think it took a lot just to kind of find my groove and where I fit in on this team,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They’ve got con­fi­dence in me, and play­ing with guys like Giannis and Khris (Mid­dle­ton), it makes my job easy.”</p>
    <p>While the new sea­son is not be­ing staged in a “bub­ble”, the league has con­fig­ured the sched­ule so that teams play each other twice in the same arena, a move made to cut down on travel amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It is a pol­icy that Pis­tons coach Dwane Casey ap­proves of, say­ing: “You don’t have the long travel, you don’t have the long days and weeks away.</p>
    <p>“You have an op­por­tu­nity to pre­pare for a team twice, like a play­off set­ting, and it’s a great ex­pe­ri­ence for us.</p>
    <p>“And then at the com­pet­i­tive level, go­ing against a team two times in a row, you kind of get a healthy dis­like for them.”</p>
