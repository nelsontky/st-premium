    <p>LON­DON • Oil rose above US$45 a bar­rel in Lon­don for the first time in 10 weeks as fi­nan­cial mar­kets con­tin­ued to ad­vance on a vac­cine break­through and US crude stock­piles ap­peared to re­treat.</p>
    <p>Brent fu­tures advanced in tan­dem with equity mar­kets, hav­ing been buoyed ini­tially this week by the elec­tion of Mr Joe Bi­den as United States pres­i­dent, and then Pfizer’s vac­cine an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the over­all price struc­ture has strength­ened with a sharp nar­row­ing of the spreads be­tween monthly con­tracts, sig­nalling that fears of over­sup­ply are abat­ing. “There’s op­ti­mism now that there’s light at the end of the tun­nel,” said Mr Harry Tchilin­guirian, head of com­mod­ity mar­kets strat­egy at BNP Paribas. “Ex­pec­ta­tions around the path to eco­nomic re­cov­ery, and a re­cov­ery in oil de­mand, have changed and oil prices are re­flect­ing that.”</p>
    <p>The dis­count on front-month Brent ver­sus con­tracts three months out has shrunk to 75 US cents, the small­est gap since July.</p>
    <p>In US mar­kets, the spread be­tween June this year and De­cem­ber next year has nar­rowed to 34 US cents from US$1.34 at the start of the month.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can Pe­tro­leum In­sti­tute re­ported crude in­ven­to­ries dropped by 5.15 mil­lion bar­rels last week, with petrol and diesel also de­creas­ing, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the data. Of­fi­cial gov­ern­ment fig­ures are due to­day. The me­dian es­ti­mate in a Bloomberg sur­vey fore­cast a 1.9 mil­lion-bar­rel de­cline in crude stock­piles.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are rea­sons to be wary of the lat­est price surge.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 in­fec­tions have surged in Europe and the US, with Italy re­port­ing the most fa­tal­i­ties since April and Amer­i­can cities an­nounc­ing new re­stric­tions. Early find­ings on a vac­cine showed it pro­tected most peo­ple from Covid-19, but it is likely to take some time to roll out if it proves ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>“The giddy risk-on trade of the past cou­ple of days is pric­ing in fu­ture hope, but not the im­me­di­ate prac­ti­cal­i­ties and re­al­i­ties of a wors­en­ing virus surge on both sides of the At­lantic,” said Ms Van­dana Hari, founder of Vanda In­sights in Sin­ga­pore. BMO Cap­i­tal Mar­kets also said it is “too soon” for US$50 oil as the mar­ket con­tends with ris­ing Libyan out­put.</p>
    <p>The Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Pe­tro­leum Ex­port­ing Coun­tries (Opec) mem­ber has boosted oil pro­duc­tion to over one mil­lion bar­rels a day, a mile­stone for the North African coun­try af­ter civil war all but shut its en­ergy in­dus­try ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The next ma­jor event for the mar­ket is the Opec+ meet­ing at the end of the month, with Vi­tol Group pre­dict­ing a ma­jor draw on ex­cess global in­ven­to­ries if the al­liance de­lays a planned eas­ing of cuts.</p>
