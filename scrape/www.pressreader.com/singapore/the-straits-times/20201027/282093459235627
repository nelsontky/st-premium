    <p>A book that was crit­i­cised for its racist con­tent was moved from the chil­dren to the adult sec­tion in the li­brary. Should it have been re­moved com­pletely?</p>
    <p>The book, which touches on bul­ly­ing, should not have just been moved to the adult sec­tion. Bul­ly­ing ex­ists not just among dif­fer­ent races but even among those of the same race. Much needs to be done about bul­ly­ing in our schools.</p>

    <p>We need green- and blue-skin char­ac­ters so no one com­plains.</p>
    <p>Yiu Chi Hung</p>
    <p>So, as an adult, I’m now not even able to make de­ci­sions on the books I can read?</p>
    <p>Alexis Fong</p>
    <p>I hope Sin­ga­pore­ans are ma­ture enough to de­ter­mine what’s right and not.</p>
    <p>Billy Tan</p>
    <p>The book should not have been writ­ten, much less pub­lished, in the first place. It sur­prises me that no one in au­thor­ity re­viewed the con­tent and thought this was prob­lem­atic.</p>
    <p>Zac Yousee</p>
    <p>Re­move it. It’s not about the colour but the con­tent of the story that is wrong. Why do you need to de­scribe the fea­tures of some­body when you say he is play­ful? Just men­tion John is a play­ful kid. No need to men­tion colour.</p>
