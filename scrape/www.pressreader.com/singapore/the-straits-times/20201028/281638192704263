    <p>Em­bat­tled Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin re­ceived a fur­ther boost to his lead­er­ship yes­ter­day af­ter Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) pledged its “un­di­vided loy­alty”, just hours af­ter Umno de­cided not to quit the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment as well.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing an em­bar­rass­ing royal re­jec­tion of the gov­ern­ment’s re­quest for emer­gency pow­ers, PAS sec­re­tary-gen­eral Takiyud­din Has­san also said in its state­ment that it called on the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional (BN) to “de­fend the lead­er­ship of the Prime Min­is­ter”.</p>
    <p>“PAS ex­presses its un­di­vided loy­alty for the lead­er­ship of Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin and at the same time stresses the sup­port of all 18 MPs with the PN gov­ern­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion by Umno, the largest rul­ing party, came af­ter a se­ries of marathon meet­ings on Mon­day over whether to re­tain its sup­port for Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>PN in­for­ma­tion chief Azmin Ali also said last night that all mem­bers in the rul­ing pact have re­it­er­ated their sup­port for the Pre­mier.</p>
    <p>“PN wel­comes the spirit of sol­i­dar­ity by the com­po­nent par­ties... who have ex­pressed full sup­port for the lead­er­ship of Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din,” the Se­nior Min­is­ter for the Econ­omy said.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s con­trol of Par­lia­ment had been in doubt since Op­po­si­tion Leader An­war Ibrahim claimed last month that he had a “for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity” that would al­low him to un­seat the Pre­mier.</p>
    <p>While the as­ser­tion was never proven, the re­fusal by Malaysia’s King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad</p>
    <p>Shah, on Sun­day to sanc­tion the gov­ern­ment’s re­quest to de­clare an emer­gency raised the pres­sure over whether the Pre­mier’s al­ready ten­u­ous bloc of 113 mem­bers of the 222-strong Lower House would hold.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that a meet­ing of BN MPs fol­lowed by the Umno state and cen­tral lead­er­ship that lasted all Mon­day af­ter­noon un­til past mid­night failed to reach a con­sen­sus on a way for­ward for the grand old party. Umno fi­nally is­sued a state­ment say­ing it would con­tinue to sup­port the PN gov­ern­ment, but did not ex­plic­itly men­tion Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Muhyid­din can look for­ward to pass­ing Bud­get 2021 next month, ac­cord­ing to Umno Supreme Coun­cil mem­ber Ab­dul Rah­man Dahlan, who told The Straits Times that party MPs were or­dered to de­fend the gov­ern­ment’s slim ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The bud­get is due to be tabled on Nov 6 be­fore be­ing voted on later in the month.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment would col­lapse if it is un­able to ap­prove ex­pen­di­ture, leav­ing Malaysia open to the spec­tre of gen­eral elec­tions that would worsen what is al­ready its worst month of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions on record.</p>
    <p>But the Pre­mier is not out of the woods yet, with his largest ally set to make a list of demands for its loy­alty, in­clud­ing more say in gov­ern­ment de­ci­sions, and still de­sir­ing to go to the polls as soon as the out­break is con­tained.</p>
    <p>Changes to the Cabi­net re­main on the cards, but the im­me­di­ate pri­or­ity is for a for­mal struc­ture for the PN lead­er­ship to con­sult on ma­jor is­sues.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause many of the PN party lead­ers are not in the Cabi­net, there should be a pres­i­den­tial coun­cil where ma­jor de­ci­sions are dis­cussed, to avoid sud­den de­ci­sions like last week’s pro­posal for an emer­gency,” said Datuk Seri Ab­dul Rah­man, a for­mer min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, his deputy Mo­hamad Hasan, PAS pres­i­dent Hadi Awang and a clutch of other PN party chiefs are not in the Cabi­net.</p>
    <p>Sources told The Straits Times that some fac­tions in the party want to re­claim the pre­mier­ship it held from in­de­pen­dence un­til its shock elec­toral de­feat in 2018.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, for­mer pre­mier Na­jib Razak ad­mit­ted to propos­ing a pact with Datuk Seri An­war, sans ally Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP), which Umno al­leges is out to un­der­mine the in­ter­ests of the Malay-Mus­lim ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>But the pro­posal drew fire from nearly all Umno law­mak­ers, who found the prospect of work­ing with their two-decade long neme­sis anath­ema, or did not be­lieve the Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat pres­i­dent could ditch the DAP.</p>
