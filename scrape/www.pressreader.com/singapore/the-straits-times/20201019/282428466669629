    <p>The dis­rup­tion and changes to daily lives and rou­tines – and anx­i­ety – dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic can bring about high lev­els of stress, re­sult­ing in un­healthy di­etary habits and weight gain.</p>
    <p>Here are five tips to man­age binge eat­ing or overeat­ing due to stress.</p>
    <p>1 Start a food and mood di­ary</p>
    <p>Ev­ery time you overeat or feel com­pelled to reach for a snack, take a mo­ment to fig­ure out what trig­gered the urge.</p>
    <p>Write it down in your food and mood di­ary: what you ate or wanted to eat, what hap­pened to up­set you, how you felt be­fore you ate, what you felt as you were eat­ing and how you felt af­ter that.</p>
    <p>Over time, you may see a pat­tern emerge and it may be eas­ier to solve the prob­lem when you know ex­actly what causes it.</p>
    <p>2 Main­tain a healthy meal sched­ule</p>
    <p>You may find your­self adapt­ing your eat­ing pat­tern to ac­com­mo­date your new nor­mal if you are work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>Try to main­tain a reg­u­lar eat­ing pat­tern based on your needs and pre­ferred eat­ing times.</p>
    <p>If you find your­self con­stantly snack­ing, try mak­ing a sched­ule that in­cludes at least two proper meals a day and fol­low­ing it un­til you feel that you have be­come com­fort­ably con­sis­tent in your eat­ing habits.</p>
    <p>3 Avoid temp­ta­tion</p>
    <p>Hav­ing tempt­ing foods within reach can lead to fre­quent snack­ing and overeat­ing, even when you are not hun­gry.</p>
    <p>You are more likely to overeat if you have junk food, desserts and un­healthy snacks in the house. Re­move the temp­ta­tion by clear­ing your fridge and cup­boards of such food.</p>
    <p>4 Dis­tract your­self</p>
    <p>Find­ing other ways to re­lieve stress such as go­ing for a walk, read­ing a book, talk­ing to a friend or watch­ing a com­edy may help.</p>
    <p>Once you get in­ter­ested in some­thing else, the urge to binge or overeat may go away.</p>
    <p>Re­search has also shown that phys­i­cal ac­tiv­ity can boost mood and re­duce stress, which may re­duce your chances of binge eat­ing or overeat­ing.</p>
    <p>5 Seek help</p>
    <p>Psy­cho­log­i­cal treat­ment can help you to iden­tify trig­gers such as stress for binge eat­ing and ad­vise you on how to man­age them.</p>
    <p>Con­nect­ing with oth­ers who are un­der­go­ing a sim­i­lar ex­pe­ri­ence can also be help­ful. Hear­ing from other peo­ple who stopped binge­ing can be mo­ti­vat­ing.</p>
