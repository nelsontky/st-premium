    <p>NEW YORK • Tele­vi­sion rat­ings mat­ter to US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. So these num­bers may st­ing.</p>
    <p>In a vic­tory that few in the tele­vi­sion and po­lit­i­cal are­nas pre­dicted, Mr Joe Bi­den’s town-hall-style fo­rum on ABC last Thurs­day night drew a larger au­di­ence than Mr Trump’s com­pet­ing event on NBC, ac­cord­ing to data firm Nielsen.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s town hall meet­ing, which aired on a sin­gle net­work, was seen by an av­er­age of 15.1 mil­lion view­ers, com­pared with 13.5 mil­lion for Mr Trump’s event even though the Pres­i­dent mo­nop­o­lised three net­works – NBC, MSNBC and CNBC – si­mul­ta­ne­ously.</p>
    <p>The town halls were vastly dif­fer­ent tele­vi­sion spec­ta­cles, be­fit­ting their re­spec­tive pro­tag­o­nists.</p>
    <p>For an hour on NBC, Mr Trump was dart­ing and de­fi­ant as the To­day show’s host Sa­van­nah Guthrie pressed him to de­nounce QAnon and white supremacy (Mr Trump hes­i­tated on both) and clear up ques­tions about his med­i­cal con­di­tion.</p>
    <p>On ABC, Mr Bi­den and the mod­er­a­tor, Mr Ge­orge Stephanopo­u­los, en­gaged in a sober 90-minute pol­icy dis­cus­sion more akin to a PBS tele­cast.</p>
    <p>Me­dia com­pany Politico wrote that flip­ping back and forth be­tween the two was like “go­ing from Bob Ross to WrestleMa­nia”.</p>
    <p>NBC had drawn scorn for sched­ul­ing its event with Mr Trump at the same time as Mr Bi­den’s pre­vi­ously an­nounced ABC fo­rum.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tives at NBC News said it was a mat­ter of fair­ness, say­ing they wanted the same con­di­tions of­fered to Mr Bi­den at his NBC town hall on Oct 5.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics, in­clud­ing MSNBC com­men­ta­tor Rachel Mad­dow, sug­gested that NBC had erred in al­low­ing Mr Trump to ap­pear at the same time as Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>It ap­pears that Mr Bi­den did not need to worry. And the fact that the Demo­crat out­drew his vol­u­ble Repub­li­can ri­val is likely to in­spire dozens of hot takes about whether, af­ter four sea­sons, Amer­i­cans are sim­ply grow­ing bored with The Trump Show.</p>
