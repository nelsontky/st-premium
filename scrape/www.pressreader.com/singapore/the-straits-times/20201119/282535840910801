    <p>For his 20th al­bum, the Boss (above) re­unites with the mem­bers of his E Street Band after their last tour in 2016. Recorded live in his home stu­dio in New Jer­sey, Let­ter To You was partly in­spired by the death of for­mer band­mate Ge­orge Theiss. Nine of the 12 songs are new.</p>
    <p>The rest – If I Was The Priest, Janey Needs A Shooter and Song For Or­phans –are old songs that Spring­steen wrote in the early 1970s but did not re­lease.</p>
    <p>Ac­com­pa­ny­ing the al­bum’s re­lease is a doc­u­men­tary film, Bruce Spring­steen’s Let­ter To You, put out by Ap­ple Orig­i­nal Films.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian rock leg­ends AC/DC are show­ing no signs of slow­ing down and have re­leased their 17th al­bum – the first for the 47-year-old Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in­ductees since 2014’s Rock Or Bust.</p>
    <p>Found­ing mem­ber An­gus Young, who still plays lead gui­tars in his trade­mark school­boy uni­form, told BBC News re­cently that the band have no qualms about stay­ing true to their hard rock for­mula: “We stuck to what we did best. We al­ways found that our strength, not our weak­ness.”</p>
    <p>The al­bum is ded­i­cated to his brother and the band’s late rhythm gui­tarist Mal­colm Young, who died in 2017 after a long bat­tle with de­men­tia.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>English singer-song­writer Elvis Costello has been noth­ing short of pro­lific since he made his de­but in the late 1970s. Hey Clock­face is the 31st al­bum from the multi-Grammy win­ner and Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in­ductee. Most of the songs were recorded in a three-day ses­sion in Paris in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Costello says of the ti­tle track: “This is a song about pick­ing an ar­gu­ment with time, the very clock face, either run­ning too fast or too slow, de­pend­ing on the com­pany you keep.”</p>

    <p>Vir­tual band Go­ril­laz’s new al­bum fea­tures a host of for­mi­da­ble names from the pop and al­ter­na­tive mu­sic scene. Elton John, to­gether with Amer­i­can rap­per 6lack, ap­pears in The Pink Phantom; The Cure front­man Robert Smith fea­tures in al­bum opener Strange Timez; and Amer­i­can singer-song­writer Beck is on The Val­ley Of The Pa­gans.</p>
    <p>The songs are part of a Web se­ries ti­tled Song Ma­chine, which Go­ril­laz – made up of Blur front­man Da­mon Al­barn, artist Jamie Hewlett and pro­duc­er­drum­mer Remi Kabaka Jr – started in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Fun fact: The cover of Earth To Dora, the 13th al­bum by Amer­i­can al­ter­na­tive rock stal­warts Eels, is a paint­ing that had been hang­ing in front­man Mark Oliver Everett’s bath­room for a decade.</p>
    <p>He told Bill­board mag­a­zine in a re­cent in­ter­view that the Dora in the al­bum ti­tle is named after a friend who worked on the lights at the band’s past con­certs.</p>
    <p>She was go­ing through a hard time and Everett was try­ing to make her feel bet­ter.</p>
    <p>He said: “Most of the lyrics of the song came di­rectly from things I was tex­ting to her. I re­alised, maybe I can cheer up some more peo­ple if I turn them into lyrics for a song.”</p>

    <p>Bri­tish girl group Lit­tle Mix’s sixth al­bum in­cludes three pre­vi­ously re­leased sin­gles – Break Up Song, Hol­i­day and Sweet Melody.</p>
    <p>The group is plan­ning a tour across the United King­dom and Ire­land in April and May next year.</p>
    <p>A por­tion of the ticket sales will go to two char­i­ties – Black Minds Mat­ter UK and Nord­off Rob­bins Mu­sic Ther­apy.</p>

    <p>US singer-song­writer Adri­anne Lenker – best known as singer and gui­tarist of in­die rock band Big Thief – has re­leased two solo al­bums, Songs and Instrument­als.</p>
    <p>“There are two records; they are con­nected but meant to of­fer sep­a­rate ex­pe­ri­ences,” she writes on so­cial me­dia. The songs were writ­ten after a break-up and the can­cel­la­tion of Big Thief’s tour due to the Covid-19 pan­demic. “If you could use some sup­port in the form of songs, give it a spin. These songs have helped me heal,” she says.</p>
    <p>The wa­ter­colour paint­ing that ap­pears on both al­bums were done by her grand­mother Dianne Lee.</p>

    <p>Dakiti, a sin­gle by Puerto Ri­can singers Bad Bunny and Jhay Cortez, shot straight to No. 1 on Bill­board’s Hot Latin Songs chart upon its re­lease. It con­tin­ues a win­ning streak for Bad Bunny – all three songs that achieved the feat this year were all his.</p>
    <p>He told Bill­board that the creative process be­hind the song was dif­fer­ent from that of his pre­vi­ous works.</p>
    <p>“It was a com­bined ef­fort, which is un­usual for me, but when one works as a team, great things come out,” he says of work­ing with Cortez and fel­low Puerto Ri­can artists Mora and Tainy.</p>
