    <p>SHANG­HAI • Zoom Video Com­mu­ni­ca­tions will shift to a part­neronly model i n main­land China from Aug 23, sus­pend­ing di­rect sales to all cus­tomers in the re­gion, the com­pany said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Zoom cus­tomers in China re­ceived an e-mail yes­ter­day in­form­ing them of the change, and telling them it would pro­vide users with “bet­ter lo­cal sup­port”.</p>
    <p>In the e-mail, seen by Reuters, Zoom listed Biz­conf Com­mu­ni­ca­tions, Suiri Zhumu Video Con­fer­ence and Sys­tec Umeet as part­ners that can of­fer its com­mer­cial ser­vice to cus­tomers in China.</p>
    <p>Zoom has been dis­tanc­ing it­self from its China op­er­a­tions, which are un­der the scru­tiny of rights ac­tivists and pri­vacy ad­vo­cates.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said in May that it would sus­pend new free user reg­is­tra­tions in China and limit new user reg­is­tra­tions to en­ter­prise cus­tomers who sign up through au­tho­rised sales rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
    <p>But in June, Zoom came un­der fire when it was re­vealed that it had shut an ac­count be­long­ing to a group of US-based Chi­nese ac­tivists tak­ing part in an on­line video group chat to memo­ri­alise the Tianan­men Square mas­sacre.</p>
    <p>In a blog post, Zoom con­firmed it had tem­po­rar­ily shut down the ac­counts due to a re­quest from China’s gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>It said that it had re­in­stated the ter­mi­nated ac­counts and “will have a new process for han­dling sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tions”.</p>
    <p>Months ear­lier, se­cu­rity re­searchers dis­cov­ered that Zoom re-routed some calls through its servers in China, even if those calls were placed out­side China.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said that the rerout­ing took place in “ex­tremely lim­ited cir­cum­stances” and that it had taken its main­land China data cen­tres off an ap­proved list of back­ups for users out­side of China.</p>
