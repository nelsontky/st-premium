    <p>The an­tic­i­pa­tion has helped drive a nearly five­fold rally in the stock this year to al­most US$390 bil­lion (S$525 bil­lion), mak­ing the elec­tric ve­hi­cle pi­o­neer the big­gest com­pany ever to be added to the gauge.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • Tesla, bil­lion­aire Elon Musk’s 17-year-old up­start car­maker, took a gi­ant step to­wards blue-chip re­spectabil­ity on Mon­day, get­ting named to one of the world’s most fa­mous stock in­dexes in an ac­tion that will greatly broaden its in­vestor base.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ment that Tesla will en­ter the S&P 500 on Dec 21 fol­lows months of spec­u­la­tion and one tem­po­rary set­back, af­ter the stock failed to make the cut dur­ing the in­dex’s quar­terly re­bal­anc­ing in early Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>The an­tic­i­pa­tion has helped drive a nearly five­fold rally in the stock this year to al­most US$390 bil­lion (S$525 bil­lion), mak­ing the elec­tric ve­hi­cle pi­o­neer the big­gest com­pany ever to be added to the gauge.</p>
    <p>It will also be one of the in­dex’s most in­flu­en­tial con­stituents, with a weight­ing that falls around those of Berk­shire Hath­away, John­son & John­son and Proc­ter & Gam­ble.</p>
    <p>It is so big that S&P Dow Jones Indices said it is seek­ing feed­back from the in­vest­ment com­mu­nity to de­ter­mine if Tesla should be added all at once or in two sep­a­rate pieces.</p>
    <p>The com­pany that Tesla is to re­place in the in­dex will be named later, the in­dex provider said.</p>
    <p>Tesla shares rose as much as 15 per cent to US$467.50 on Mon­day in ex­tended New York trad­ing on the news.</p>
    <p>While en­try into the bench­mark is a rite of ma­tu­rity that may dim some of Tesla’s cult stock ap­peal, mem­ber­ship comes with ben­e­fits, in­clud­ing forced pur­chases by in­dex-track­ing in­vestors and mu­tual funds.</p>
    <p>The in­clu­sion and the rapid rally over the past few months mean money man­agers over­see­ing pas­sive funds will have to sell tens of bil­lions of dol­lars worth of shares in their ex­ist­ing S&P hold­ings to make room for Tesla.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, long-time in­vestors look­ing to exit their po­si­tions may now try to get out, know­ing that in­dex funds have to buy.</p>
    <p>Th­ese cross-cur­rents may mean more trad­ing volatil­ity, though that is not new for Tesla. Ever since go­ing pub­lic in 2010, the com­pany’s pop­u­lar­ity with acolytes of Mr Musk and le­gions of day traders has made it one of the more volatile stocks of its size in Amer­ica. A stead­ier, more in­sti­tu­tional own­er­ship base could help to even­tu­ally ease those swings.</p>
    <p>Tesla has so­lid­i­fied its po­si­tion as the lead­ing elec­tric car­maker glob­ally, even though com­pe­ti­tion is slowly heat­ing up. It has over­come chal­lenges, in­clud­ing some­times­se­vere pro­duc­tion snarls, a mas­sive cash burn rate and con­cerns about the de­mand for bat­tery-powered ve­hi­cles in an in­dus­try dom­i­nated by gas-powered cars.</p>
    <p>In mid-Septem­ber, Tesla re­ported a fifth con­sec­u­tive quar­terly profit, qui­et­ing crit­ics who ques­tioned its abil­ity to make money.</p>
    <p>In­deed, all it had taken was Mr Musk hint­ing at the sec­ond-quar­ter profit – the com­pany’s fourth con­sec­u­tive prof­itable quar­ter – in a let­ter to em­ploy­ees in late June to trig­ger a 66 per cent surge in the stock over a span of 17 trad­ing days, since the re­sults checked off the last re­quire­ment for S&P 500 in­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>Tesla’s sky-high share price also prompted a five-for-one stock split, a move aimed at mak­ing it more ac­ces­si­ble to in­di­vid­ual in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The shares started trad­ing on a split-ad­justed ba­sis on Aug 31.</p>
    <p>Join­ing one of the world’s most exclusive clubs is a val­i­da­tion for Mr Musk and his un­ortho­dox man­age­ment style. His chief lieu­tenants are lit­tle known and rarely made avail­able to the me­dia or in­vestors, and Mr Musk courts con­tro­versy like few other cor­po­rate cap­tains.</p>
    <p>He has picked fights with se­cu­ri­ties an­a­lysts, smoked mar­i­juana dur­ing an in­ter­view and been sued for fraud by se­cu­ri­ties reg­u­la­tors for tweets claim­ing he had “fund­ing se­cured” to take the com­pany pri­vate.</p>
    <p>He also has com­plained more than once that Tesla’s stock price is too high. But that has not de­terred in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Tesla has tapped into that in­vestor good­will with mul­ti­ple sec­ondary share of­fer­ings over the past decade, rais­ing US$14 bil­lion through Fe­bru­ary and another US$5 bil­lion in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>That has helped it fund new ve­hi­cle de­vel­op­ment and rapidly ex­pand man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
