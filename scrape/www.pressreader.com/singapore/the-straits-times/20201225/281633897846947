    <p>With the dis­cov­ery of new, more con­ta­gious strains of the Covid-19 virus in Bri­tain and South Africa, it may now be im­por­tant for more Sin­ga­pore­ans to get vac­ci­nated against the coro­n­avirus, said a health ex­pert here.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, said yes­ter­day: “This is the only way we can con­tinue to en­sure that the com­mu­nity as a whole is pro­tected.”</p>
    <p>This means that in­stead of aim­ing to get 80 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion here vac­ci­nated against Covid-19, “we may now be look­ing at 90 per cent, or even higher”, Prof Teo said in a video in­ter­view with The Straits Times on its daily on­line talk show, The Big Story.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry’s chief health sci­en­tist, Pro­fes­sor Tan Chorh Chuan, pre­vi­ously told The Straits Times that at least 80 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion would have to be vac­ci­nated to achieve herd im­mu­nity against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A new B117 strain of Covid-19 cir­cu­lat­ing in Bri­tain has been re­ported to be more con­ta­gious, but has not shown signs of be­ing more lethal or se­vere.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore recorded its first case of this strain on Wed­nes­day – a 17-year-old Sin­ga­porean girl who had re­turned from Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said yes­ter­day that cur­rent re­search in­di­cates that the new strains will not af­fect the ef­fec­tive­ness of vac­cines, though a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the new strains is needed be­fore de­ter­min­ing the likely im­pact and mak­ing ap­pro­pri­ate pol­icy de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“Gov­ern­ments are con­cerned (about the new strains) be­cause of the im­pact that they have in manag­ing the spread of Covid-19 in the com­mu­nity, and also any po­ten­tial im­pact on vac­cine ef­fec­tive­ness and qual­ity con­trol mea­sures,” said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>“But for in­di­vid­u­als like you and me, as long as we con­tinue to dili­gently prac­tise the nec­es­sary safe man­age­ment mea­sures, there is no need to be overly con­cerned with th­ese new mu­ta­tions.”</p>
    <p>Present re­search also in­di­cates that the new strains are trans­mit­ted be­tween peo­ple in the same way as the older strains, though they are more con­ta­gious as an in­fected per­son with the new vari­ant may have a higher vi­ral load in his up­per res­pi­ra­tory tract, said Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>This is why ex­ist­ing mea­sures such as wear­ing a mask prop­erly and main­tain­ing the nec­es­sary so­cial dis­tance, if fol­lowed, can still min­imise the chance of an in­fected per­son pass­ing the virus to some­one who is healthy, he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo also ad­vised that dur­ing the year-end fes­tive pe­riod, Sin­ga­pore­ans should con­tinue to fol­low safe dis­tanc­ing rules and mea­sures to keep them­selves, as well as their fam­ily and friends, safe from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
