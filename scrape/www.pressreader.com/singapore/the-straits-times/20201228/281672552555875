    <p>Five new coro­n­avirus cases were con­firmed yes­ter­day, of which all were im­ported.</p>
    <p>This brings Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal cases to 58,524. Among the five new cases is a 23-year-old fe­male work per­mit holder from Malaysia who was on a stay-home no­tice (SHN) at Man­darin Or­chard Sin­ga­pore be­fore she was trans­ferred to an­other ded­i­cated SHN fa­cil­ity on Dec 20.</p>
    <p>On that day, MOH com­menced in­ves­ti­ga­tions into 13 pre­vi­ously re­ported cases who had served SHNs at the ho­tel be­tween Oct 22 and Nov 11.</p>
    <p>The 13 cases, which came from 10 dif­fer­ent coun­tries, were in­fected by coro­n­avirus strains with “high ge­netic sim­i­lar­ity”, which im­plied that the in­fec­tions might have come from one source and could have hap­pened in the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian woman was swabbed on Dec 19 and Dec 21, and her test re­sults were neg­a­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>But her swab on Dec 24 at the end of her SHN came back pos­i­tive, and she was taken to the hos­pi­tal the next day.</p>
    <p>A con­fir­ma­tory test by the Na­tional Pub­lic Health Lab­o­ra­tory (NPHL) was also pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a se­cond sam­ple taken by NPHL on Satur­day came back neg­a­tive, and her sero­log­i­cal test re­sult was also neg­a­tive. The lat­ter test de­ter­mines if the in­fec­tion was an old one.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing to de­ter­mine if she could be linked to the 13 cases be­ing in­ves­ti­gated by MOH.</p>
    <p>Among the other four im­ported cases con­firmed yes­ter­day is a 33-year-old male per­ma­nent res­i­dent who re­turned from Ukraine.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing three cases are for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers hold­ing work per­mits – two In­done­sians, aged 37 and 38, and a 48-year-old Filipino woman.</p>
    <p>All five im­ported cases had al­ready been placed on SHNs upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with only one such case in the past week, who is cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>With eight cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,355 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 31 Covid-19 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 94 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
