    <p>An in­ter­est­ing premise, good cutscene an­i­ma­tion and in­no­va­tive game­play could not save Dis­in­te­gra­tion from fall­ing apart.</p>
    <p>This sci-fi strat­egy shooter game is set in near-fu­ture Earth where, for the sake of sur­vival, most of the hu­man race have opted to trade their or­ganic bod­ies for ro­botic ones and be­come “in­te­grated hu­mans”.</p>
    <p>You play as one of them. Your char­ac­ter, a for­mer racer turned rebel named Romer Shoal, leads a team of out­laws against Ray­onne, a mil­i­taris­tic anti-hu­man ro­bot army that cap­tures and in­doc­tri­nates in­te­grated hu­mans to join its ranks.</p>
    <p>Romer and his crew of in­te­grated hu­man out­laws have dis­tinct per­son­al­i­ties that play off one an­other well, with the crew ban­ter dur­ing cutscenes par­tic­u­larly en­ter­tain­ing. Each mem­ber of the crew has unique phys­i­cal traits.</p>
    <p>The game­play is an in­ter­est­ing mix of real-time strat­egy and first­per­son shoot­ing. Imag­ine play­ing Com­mand & Con­quer, but in­stead of just look­ing down at the bat­tle­field and mov­ing your units around, you get to par­take in the ac­tion too.</p>
    <p>As Romer, you pi­lot a Grav­cy­cle, which al­lows you to hover while di­rect­ing three of your units where they should go, or who they should fire at. Each mem­ber has abil­i­ties you can com­mand, from lob­bing grenades that stag­ger or slow down en­e­mies to car­ry­ing out mor­tar strikes.</p>
    <p>When things get hec­tic and your team mem­bers get in­jured, you can heal them. You can also pick up their “brain can” when they are downed, so they can be spawned to go back into the fight.</p>
    <p>This hy­brid game­play of shoot­ing, com­mand­ing, ma­noeu­vring and heal­ing is, in a nut­shell, what Dis­in­te­gra­tion is about.</p>
    <p>How­ever, shoot­ing en­e­mies from the sky gets ex­tremely finicky the fur­ther you are away from the ac­tion. En­e­mies be­come smaller and the con­trols lack the fi­nesse for you to shoot as ac­cu­rately and is­sue com­mands that your crew can ex­e­cute with pre­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Even in the eas­i­est set­tings, fights can be a les­son in pa­tience as your crew keep dy­ing while you fail to make much of a dent on the en­emy forces.</p>
    <p>If this seems like fun, you will be happy to know you can take all this ac­tion on­line in three multiplaye­r player-vs-player modes. You will be lucky to find any­one else play­ing the game though.</p>
    <p>This gen­eral lack of pol­ish is what sours the Dis­in­te­gra­tion ex­pe­ri­ence for me. For ex­am­ple, I could hear un­bal­anced au­dio lev­els, with ex­plo­sions drown­ing out di­a­logue, and miss­ing au­dio ef­fects from the very first cutscene.</p>
    <p>There is also lit­tle to do between story mis­sions other than roam around a small base or land­ing zone. En­vi­ron­ments are bland and de­void of life, with the story ex­po­si­tion min­i­mal as you go from point to point pick­ing up op­tional chal­lenge ob­jec­tives for your next mis­sion.</p>
    <p>I also find the game’s menus clut­tered, which makes nav­i­gat­ing in them a has­sle when boxes of text are fight­ing for the player’s at­ten</p>
    <p>tion. One more thing – if, like me, you use the “O” but­ton on your PlayS­ta­tion con­troller for the “en­ter” func­tion, you will have to as­sign the “X” but­ton to the func­tion in­stead. Oth­er­wise, you will not be able to get out of the menus af­ter you get in.</p>
    <p>Dis­in­te­gra­tion’s de­vel­oper is V1 In­ter­ac­tive, a new in­de­pen­dent game stu­dio founded by Mar­cus Le­hto, who is the co-cre­ator of the pop­u­lar Halo se­ries. In Dis­in­te­gra­tion’s de­fence, that rep­u­ta­tion has prob­a­bly brought on an overly high ex­pec­ta­tion, which, un­for­tu­nately, has not been met for the stu­dio’s first out­ing.</p>
