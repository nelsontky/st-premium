    <p>Ly­dia Lim</p>
    <p>We were look­ing at menus when he popped the ques­tion: “So, what do you con­sider the great­est so­cial prob­lem of our time?”</p>
    <p>Un­sure how to re­spond, I kept quiet. The other per­son in our group of three had known</p>
    <p>Mr So­cial Con­science for far longer, so he kept his eyes fixed on the menu and mut­tered: “I just want to or­der dessert.”</p>
    <p>That in­ci­dent from long ago cap­tures my own ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing thrown off bal­ance by a friend who was more so­cially aware than I was. Today, the term for a height­ened state of so­cial aware­ness is “woke”, defined since 2017 by the Ox­ford English Dic­tio­nary as “alert to in­jus­tice in so­ci­ety, es­pe­cially racism”.</p>
    <p>I re­call that mem­ory with mixed feel­ings as I ob­serve the fer­ment over mi­grant worker rights and the ques­tions be­ing raised over Sin­ga­pore’s jus­tice sys­tem, in the wake of the High Court’s re­cent ac­quit­tal of Ms Parti Liyani, a for­eign do­mes­tic worker who had been ac­cused by her for­mer em­ployer, Mr Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily, of hav­ing stolen tens of thou­sands of dol­lars’ worth of goods from them.</p>
    <p>On Face­book, I read a post that said “we live in a time when a maid can bring down a chair­man”.</p>
    <p>Do we?</p>
    <p>CHAL­LENG­ING STA­TUS QUO</p>
    <p>So­cial me­dia am­pli­fies anti-es­tab­lish­ments points of view that some of us may find new and dis­com­fit­ing, but Sin­ga­pore is nowhere near a so­cial up­heaval. I stress this be­cause de­fend­ers of the sta­tus quo may fear an over­throw of in­sti­tu­tions in place for decades, and there­after a slip­pery slope to na­tional ruin.</p>
    <p>But change does not come so eas­ily, as long-time ad­vo­cates of so­cial causes well know.</p>
    <p>The case in which Ms Parti se­cured an ac­quit­tal against theft charges filed by her rich and well-con­nected for­mer em­ployer is a rare ex­cep­tion. That is one rea­son it has be­come a na­tional talking point and source of de­bate.</p>
    <p>Its fall­out sug­gests a greater ease among some sec­tors of Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety to chal­lenge the sta­tus quo, to ask awk­ward ques­tions of pow­er­ful peo­ple, and to do so more openly than in the past.</p>
    <p>Whether or not you think that is a good thing, it is a new re­al­ity that all of us have to grap­ple with.</p>
    <p>The new ca­coph­ony of causes and voices is jar­ring to those of us more used to the har­mony of old.</p>
    <p>Yes, so­cial har­mony is im­por­tant but I be­lieve too much of it can im­pede progress. Dis­so­nance can rouse us from our slum­ber.</p>
    <p>AC­TIVISTS DON’T FOL­LOW TRENDS</p>
    <p>Still, not all who ques­tion those in power do so re­spon­si­bly. Some are heady with the feel­ing of be­ing able to ex­press them­selves more freely than be­fore; oth­ers do so be­cause it’s now cool to be “woke”.</p>
    <p>Those who dally with so­cial causes as a fad are likely to far out­num­ber those who re­gard right­ing cer­tain wrongs in so­ci­ety as a mis­sion. The lat­ter stand out by their ac­tions – they sac­ri­fice time, money and ef­fort in pur­suit of jus­tice for those with less power, and they per­se­vere in the face of ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>Among them is Ms Deb­bie Fordyce, pres­i­dent of mi­grant work­ers’ ad­vo­cacy group TWC2. She shared her ob­ser­va­tions on trendy causes in an in­ter­view with aca­demic Philip Holden, which was pub­lished on Academia.sg in May.</p>
    <p>“I feel strongly about mi­grant work­ers be­cause I’ve been work­ing with this group for so long and I’ve be­come aware of what hap­pens while they’re in Sin­ga­pore and af­ter they re­turn home,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Now, be­cause of the pan­demic, they’ve be­come a sexy topic, with</p>
    <p>lots more peo­ple want­ing to get in­volved. It’s great to have do­na­tions and of­fers to vol­un­teer, but the de­sire to ‘make the world a bet­ter place’ doesn’t re­quire you to seek out a trendy cause...</p>
    <p>“Whether with mi­grant work­ers, or any­one else in a po­si­tion of dis­em­pow­er­ment, be aware of what in­equal­ity, poverty and des­per­a­tion do to peo­ple, both those with priv­i­lege and access, and those with­out. Be pre­pared to stand up for what you be­lieve.”</p>
    <p>CAST­ING STONES IS NOT AC­TIVISM</p>
    <p>There was lit­tle crow­ing from the ac­tivists at the Hu­man­i­tar­ian Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion Eco­nom­ics (Home) af­ter Ms Parti was ac­quit­ted by the High Court.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the char­ity and its ac­tivists – who had be­lieved in Ms Parti’s in­no­cence from the be­gin­ning, helped her se­cure legal aid and shel­tered and sup­ported her dur­ing the four years she fought the case – is­sued a sober, fac­tual state­ment to high­light “the sys­temic dif­fi­cul­ties that mi­grant work­ers face when they are wrong­fully ac­cused”.</p>
    <p>“Such mi­grant work­ers are left wait­ing in a for­eign coun­try while in­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing, with­out any in­di­ca­tion of the length of such in­ves­ti­ga­tions,” Home said in its state­ment is­sued on the day of Ms Parti’s ac­quit­tal on Sept 4.</p>
    <p>The state­ment con­tin­ued: “In Yani’s case, she was ar­rested on</p>
    <p>Dec 2, 2016, charged on Aug 31, 2017, and has spent al­most four years at Home’s shel­ter, wait­ing for the con­clu­sion of her case. We also pro­vided her a bailor for the sum of $15,000, an op­tion which is not avail­able for most mi­grant work­ers ac­cused of crimes.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese mi­grant work­ers are of­ten not al­lowed to work, thus they are re­liant on or­gan­i­sa­tions like Home to pro­vide them shel­ter, food, and fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance. Dur­ing this time, they are also not al­lowed to leave the coun­try, and have no means of see­ing their fam­i­lies back home.</p>
    <p>“Con­se­quently, by the time many mi­grant work­ers are pre­sented with charges, they choose to plead guilty even if they are of the view that they are in­no­cent of the charges that they are fac­ing. The time it takes for them to serve their sen­tence may be shorter than the time it takes to go through the court process. Home be­lieves that ev­ery in­di­vid­ual should be given a chance to a fair trial, and access to legal rep­re­sen­ta­tion, re­gard­less of their work pass sta­tus or na­tion­al­ity.</p>
    <p>“Home would also like to ex­press our deep ap­pre­ci­a­tion for Mr Anil Balchan­dani, who has worked tire­lessly to rep­re­sent Yani at the trial and ap­peal stage. We are also very grate­ful for the many volunteers and in­terns who have been in­volved in Yani’s case and who helped her ma­noeu­vre the com­plex­i­ties of her case.”</p>
    <p>Con­trast that state­ment to the on­line bash­ing by key­board war­riors, in­clud­ing on the Face­book page of Changi Air­port Group, which drew some ne­ti­zens’ ire sim­ply be­cause Mr Liew Mun Leong was then chair­man of its board. He has since stepped down from the po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>While it is im­por­tant for cit­i­zens to feel em­pow­ered to speak truth to power, there is a dif­fer­ence be­tween us­ing so­cial me­dia to call out in­di­vid­u­als on­line, and ac­tual ac­tivism. For­mer US pres­i­dent Barack Obama said as much in Oc­to­ber 2019, dur­ing an in­ter­view on ac­tivism. He spoke out against “call out cul­ture” or “can­cel cul­ture”, which cel­e­brates the use of so­cial me­dia to sit in judg­ment of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>“That’s not ac­tivism. That’s not bring­ing about change,” Mr Obama said. “If all you’re do­ing is cast­ing stones, you’re prob­a­bly not go­ing to get that far. That’s easy to do.” He also pointed out that “the world is messy; there are am­bi­gu­i­ties”, adding that “peo­ple who do re­ally good stuff have flaws”.</p>
    <p>More re­cently, dur­ing this year’s gen­eral elec­tion cam­paign,</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong also cau­tioned against a cul­ture of trial by In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>I wel­come more open de­bate in Sin­ga­pore on key so­cial is­sues, but I also think many of us have much to learn about en­gag­ing in ways that are re­spect­ful and re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The aim should not be to tear down in­di­vid­u­als or in­sti­tu­tions but to build a bet­ter Sin­ga­pore, based on – to quote our Na­tional Pledge – jus­tice and equal­ity.</p>
