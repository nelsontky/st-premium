    <p>MA­NARA (Is­rael) • Is­rael said yes­ter­day that it had launched air strikes against Hizbol­lah ob­ser­va­tion posts in Le­banon af­ter shots were fired from across the bor­der to­wards its troops the pre­vi­ous evening.</p>
    <p>The bor­der flare-up came hours af­ter Le­banon re­jected an Is­raeli call to re­form the United Na­tions peace­keep­ing force that pa­trols the bor­der ahead of a UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil vote to re­new its man­date.</p>
    <p>The Is­raeli mil­i­tary had said ear­lier that a “se­cu­rity in­ci­dent” was un­fold­ing near Ma­nara, a kib­butz near the UN-de­mar­cated bor­der be­tween the two coun­tries, and urged res­i­dents to take shel­ter.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing op­er­a­tional ac­tiv­ity in north­ern Is­rael last night, shots were fired from Le­banon to­wards (Is­raeli) troops,” the mil­i­tary said on Twit­ter. “We re­sponded with fire, and our air­craft struck Hizbol­lah ob­ser­va­tion posts near the bor­der. This is a se­vere event and we re­main ready to com­bat any threat to our bor­ders.”</p>
    <p>Le­banon’s state-run Na­tional News Agency re­ported Is­raeli gun­fire and flares in the Mays al-Ja­bal area across the bor­der from Ma­nara.</p>
    <p>The Is­raeli mil­i­tary said “troops de­ployed dozens of il­lu­mi­na­tion rounds and smoke shells and re­sponded with fire”. Af­ter­wards, “at­tack he­li­copters and air­craft struck ob­ser­va­tion posts be­long­ing to the Hizbol­lah ter­ror or­gan­i­sa­tion in the bor­der area”.</p>
    <p>It re­ported no Is­raeli ca­su­al­ties. Ma­nara was quiet yes­ter­day morn­ing, an Agence France-Presse jour­nal­ist re­ported. The mil­i­tary told res­i­dents they could come into the open and re­sume work in the fields.</p>
    <p>Is­rael and Le­banon are still tech­ni­cally at war, and the UN force, Unifil, is tasked with mon­i­tor­ing their cease­fire.</p>
    <p>Le­banon had hours ear­lier re­jected an Is­raeli call to re­form Unifil ahead of a UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil vote to re­new its man­date.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent also comes af­ter Hizbol­lah an­nounced at the week­end it had brought down an Is­raeli drone fly­ing over the bor­der.</p>
    <p>The Iran-backed Shi’ite mil­i­tant group vowed in Sep­tem­ber last year to down Is­raeli drones fly­ing over Le­banon, fol­low­ing an in­ci­dent a month ear­lier when two drones packed with ex­plo­sives tar­geted its strong­hold in south Beirut.</p>
    <p>Set up in 1978, Unifil was beefed up af­ter a month-long war in 2006 be­tween Is­rael and Hizbol­lah.</p>
    <p>The 10,500-strong force, in co­or­di­na­tion with the Le­banese army, is tasked with mon­i­tor­ing the cease­fire and Is­rael’s pull­out from a de­mil­i­tarised zone on the bor­der.</p>
    <p>Is­rael ac­cuses the force, whose lat­est man­date ex­pires at the end of this month, of not be­ing ac­tive enough against Hizbol­lah.</p>
    <p>But Le­banon’s care­taker for­eign min­is­ter Char­bel We­hbe in­formed the five veto-wield­ing per­ma­nent mem­bers of the United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil on Tues­day that his gov­ern­ment wanted the force to stay on “without mod­i­fy­ing its man­date or its num­bers”.</p>
    <p>Separately, Is­raeli war­planes bombed Ha­mas tar­gets in the Gaza Strip early yes­ter­day in re­sponse to Pales­tini­ans in the en­clave launch­ing in­cen­di­ary bal­loons to­wards Is­rael, the mil­i­tary said.</p>
    <p>There were no re­ports of ca­su­al­ties in the strikes that Is­rael’s mil­i­tary said tar­geted un­der­ground in­fra­struc­ture be­long­ing to Ha­mas, the Is­lamist group that rules Gaza.</p>
    <p>Ha­mas has been try­ing to pres­sure Is­rael to ease re­stric­tions on Gaza and al­low more in­vest­ment – in part by let­ting Pales­tini­ans launch he­lium bal­loons car­ry­ing in­cen­di­ary ma­te­rial that have torched tracts of south­ern Is­raeli farm­land in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Is­rael has struck Ha­mas fa­cil­i­ties al­most nightly for the past two weeks, say­ing it would not tol­er­ate the bal­loons. An­tic­i­pat­ing Is­raeli at­tacks af­ter bal­loon or rocket launches, Ha­mas rou­tinely evac­u­ates per­son­nel from its sites.</p>
    <p>Me­di­a­tors from the UN, Egypt and Qatar have been work­ing to re­store calm.</p>
    <p>We re­sponded with fire, and our air­craft struck Hizbol­lah ob­ser­va­tion posts near the bor­der. This is a se­vere event and we re­main ready to com­bat any threat to our bor­ders. ’’ THE IS­RAELI MIL­I­TARY, in a post on Twit­ter, re­gard­ing the “se­cu­rity in­ci­dent” as it un­folded near Ma­nara, a kib­butz near the UN-de­mar­cated bor­der be­tween Is­rael and Le­banon.</p>
