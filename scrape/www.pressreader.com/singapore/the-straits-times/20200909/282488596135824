    <p>Ev­ery morn­ing, I rise like a lord of old and with a lusty cry of “hey Google, good morn­ing”, my work lights and desk fan come on as if by the unseen hand of a loyal manser­vant.</p>
    <p>When I’m read­ing a story from the United States about a heat­wave, I ask my home as­sis­tant de­vice:</p>
    <p>“Hey Google, what is 115 Fahren­heit in Cel­sius?”</p>
    <p>Right now, it is my job to re­ply: “Yeah, okay, 46 deg C sounds hot, but in Sin­ga­pore, it’s the hu­mid­ity that gets you.”</p>
    <p>I hope one day to own a dig­i­tal as­sis­tant that will grasp the bril­liance of that joke, but for now, it is I alone who must chor­tle at my wit.</p>
    <p>It is the same with recipes on Amer­i­can web­sites (“How many grams is one stick of but­ter?”). The home as­sis­tant never gets tired of im­pe­rial-to-met­ric con­ver­sions, cur­rency con­ver­sions or play­ing pod­casts and In­ter­net ra­dio sta­tions.</p>
    <p>I have three such hubs scat­tered non­cha­lantly around my man­sion, wait­ing to do my re­gal bid­ding, and am end­lessly amused by their abil­ity to recog­nise my ut­ter­ances – which is some­what sad, con­sid­er­ing my age, though it is still true that tremen­dous strides in lan­guage pro­cess­ing have taken place in the last five years.</p>
    <p>For in­ter­view tran­scrip­tions, I turn to Ot­ter (which op­er­ates on a freemium plan) and Trint (paid), two ma­chine-based on­line ser­vices that con­vert speech to text. Both are eerily ac­cu­rate.</p>
    <p>In case you think this is a Google ad, Ap­ple’s Siri, Ama­zon’s Alexa and Mi­crosoft’s Cor­tana as­sis­tants are un­can­nily good at pick­ing up spo­ken com­mands too.</p>
    <p>But speech-recog­ni­tion sys­tems are re­mark­ably good un­til they are not. If I were to ask Google</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant some­thing just out­side its pa­ram­e­ters, such as “what’s the lat­est e-mail in my in­box?”, “send a text mes­sage” or “mute my iPhone”, I get a re­sponse that makes me pic­ture all the tech bros of Sil­i­con Val­ley laugh­ing at us fools who fell for their scam.</p>
    <p>It is the same feel­ing of frus­tra­tion I get with Jamie.</p>
    <p>“She” is an avatar on the Im­mi­gra­tion & Check­points Author­ity’s web­site, where my typed-out pleas to iron out a glitch in the on­line re-reg­is­tra­tion of my iden­tity card – which I am re­quired to do be­fore my next birthday – trap me in a Sisyphean loop.</p>
    <p>I’m sure Jamie will get smarter with time. I pray she will. Whether it is Google As­sis­tant, Cor­tana or Jamie, sys­tems that process nat­u­ral lan­guage are the fu­ture, whether we like it or not.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, we will have an in­ter­est­ing sit­u­a­tion in which cer­tain cus­tomer-fac­ing jobs – such as re­cep­tion­ists, call cen­tres and help desks – are likely to be au­to­mated away to nat­u­ral­lan­guage soft­ware be­fore blue-col­lar ones, such as de­liv­ery driv­ing and clean­ing. Other coun­tries might take the op­po­site route.</p>
    <p>It is be­cause here, hu­mans in blue-col­lar jobs, dis­taste­ful as it might seem, are cheaper than ma­chines for now, be­cause of Sin­ga­pore’s unique re­liance on for­eign labour for jobs in con­struc­tion, driv­ing and jan­i­to­rial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Once the first hill of cus­tomer-fac­ing ca­reers is con­quered by ma­chines, the next step up the value chain will be jobs such as mine.</p>
    <p>What is jour­nal­ism if not pre­sent­ing a fixed set of ques­tions, fol­lowed by re­sponses that can be pro­cessed by a com­puter into a read­able for­mat?</p>
    <p>Such news-gen­er­a­tion sys­tems have been around for years, but they mostly in­volve rote re­ports in sports matches and stock mar­kets, tasks that in­volve mas­sag­ing a pre­dictable data set into read­able para­graphs.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it should be fea­si­ble to code a bot that trawls through so­cial me­dia feeds and, based on a set of key­words, de­tect and ex­tract the news.</p>
    <p>Judg­ing by the qual­ity of screen en­ter­tain­ment th­ese days, peo­ple say that bots are al­ready auto-gen­er­at­ing screen­plays, as proven by the fact that the Trans­form­ers movies ex­ist – but that is only a ru­mour.</p>
    <p>It’s not just my job that will be coded away. Jobs in teach­ing and train­ing are a nat­u­ral fit; which stu­dent wouldn’t want an end­lessly pa­tient and om­ni­scient coach who never hurls chalk at your head?</p>
    <p>But just how good are nat­u­ral­lan­guage sys­tems? (By the way, let’s ig­nore the phrase “ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence” for now. When that term is ap­plied to lan­guage pro­cess­ing, it’s hard to sep­a­rate fact from mar­ket­ing hooey.)</p>
    <p>See for your­self by in­stalling a free English gram­mar browser plug-in, such as Gram­marly or ProWrit­ingAid. Again, their ac­cu­racy strikes me as al­most mag­i­cal.</p>
    <p>When Gram­marly makes an er­ror – for ex­am­ple, it in­cor­rectly flagged “their ac­cu­racy”, a phrase I used in the pre­vi­ous sen­tence, to be re­placed with “the ac­cu­racy” –</p>
    <p>I can tell it to un­flag that is­sue.</p>
    <p>And this is why the gram­mar checker is free. As it helps me, I re­turn the favour by teach­ing it ex­cep­tions to rules, there­fore en­larg­ing its data set. In other words, I am train­ing a sys­tem that might one day take my job.</p>
    <p>Sin­is­ter? Not re­ally. It’s only nat­u­ral to be re­placed by a new gen­er­a­tion – in this case, a gen­er­a­tion that will al­ways be punc­tual, po­lite and never tries to jam lunch left­overs down the pantry sink when no one is look­ing. Some might see that as progress.</p>
    <p>Once the first hill of cus­tomer-fac­ing ca­reers is con­quered by ma­chines, the next step up the value chain will be jobs such as mine. What is jour­nal­ism if not pre­sent­ing a fixed set of ques­tions, fol­lowed by re­sponses that can be pro­cessed by a com­puter into a read­able for­mat?</p>
