    <p>A re­tired pro­fes­sional was keen to make sure that his jour­ney to the af­ter­life started on the right foot­ing so he went ahead to plan his own fu­neral.</p>
    <p>He ap­proached his usual place of wor­ship and got all the re­li­gious lead­ers there to agree to hold an elab­o­rate fu­neral rite for him and to pray for him when his time came. But the plan did not take off be­cause when he died, his fam­ily made other ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>In­deed, the re­li­gious lead­ers found out about his death only when they met his widow much later.</p>
    <p>While no money was in­volved in this case, a So­ci­ety of Trust and Es­tate Prac­ti­tion­ers (Step) sur­vey found that over 10 per cent of adults here have prepaid for their own fu­ner­als.</p>
    <p>There is noth­ing wrong in do­ing so but the de­posits are prob­a­bly not re­fund­able if fam­i­lies choose not to go ahead with the plans.</p>
    <p>There is also no pro­tec­tion if the fu­neral plan­ners who ac­cepted the money went out of busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Such in­stances high­light another im­por­tant as­pect of legacy plan­ning – in mak­ing wills, fam­i­lies should have open and frank dis­cus­sions on their plans so that the risk of dis­putes aris­ing among the ex­ecu­tors and ben­e­fi­cia­ries can be re­duced.</p>
    <p>The poll found that up to one third of those who had wills done or were in the process of do­ing one did not dis­cuss their plans with any­one in the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>“With­out an open dis­cus­sion about how the oper­a­tion of a will im­pacts their in­ter­est as an es­tate claimant, sub­stan­tial con­flicts and es­tate claims can arise fol­low­ing the death of a will maker,” noted the poll re­searchers.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially so when cer­tain life events al­ter a fam­ily’s sta­tus quo. For in­stance, it is a com­mon prac­tice for cou­ples to be joint own­ers of their homes. This is a sound ar­range­ment be­cause if one party dies, the sur­viv­ing spouse will in­herit the prop­erty.</p>
    <p>But due to desire to in­vest in more than one prop­erty, many cou­ples have started to “de­cou­ple” their names from their mat­ri­mo­nial homes so that one of them can buy more real es­tate with­out hav­ing to pay ad­di­tional stamp du­ties.</p>
    <p>This means that after the pur­chase, the hus­band be­comes the sole owner of one prop­erty while the wife will own the other.</p>
    <p>But com­pli­ca­tions can arise if the hus­band dies with­out a will, for ex­am­ple. If the cou­ple have no chil­dren, half of the hus­band’s prop­erty will go to his par­ents if they are still around.</p>
    <p>As prop­er­ties are usu­ally a fam­ily’s most valu­able as­sets, it is wise to pay closer at­ten­tion to de­tails re­lat­ing to own­er­ship. For in­stance, only Sin­ga­pore­ans can own landed prop­er­ties. So if the owner of a good-class bun­ga­low wills it to a rel­a­tive who is not a cit­i­zen, the prop­erty may have to be sold un­less the re­cip­i­ent gets an ap­proval to own it.</p>
    <p>Step Sin­ga­pore chair­man Sim Bock Eng says that with­out proper plan­ning, those liv­ing in prop­er­ties that have to be sold may be ren­dered home­less as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>A case that she has come across in­volved an el­derly man who was liv­ing in his bun­ga­low to­gether with the fam­ily of one of his chil­dren.</p>
    <p>When the man died with­out a will, all his other chil­dren be­came equal own­ers of the bun­ga­low. As the prop­erty was of sub­stan­tial value, the son who was re­sid­ing with him could not af­ford to buy out the shares of his other sib­lings.</p>
    <p>So while the sib­lings were happy with their shares from the sale pro­ceeds of the bun­ga­low, the oc­cu­pant was up­set that his sib­lings ren­dered him home­less.</p>
    <p>If wills are so im­por­tant, why do most peo­ple still not have one? Ms Sim cites three pos­si­ble rea­sons:</p>
    <p>1. Peo­ple gen­er­ally fear or are reluc­tant to think about their mor­tal­ity. It is easy to de­fer think­ing about suc­ces­sion plan­ning, es­pe­cially when they are work­ing and deal­ing with day-to-day is­sues. After all, many feel that they can al­ways make their wills later, when they have more as­sets or are older.</p>
    <p>Also many peo­ple seem to need a push fac­tor – they will only get a will done when they ex­pe­ri­ence a calamity such as the Covid-19 pan­demic or when a col­league, friend or rel­a­tive dies un­ex­pect­edly from an ac­ci­dent or ill­ness.</p>
    <p>“Con­sis­tently, we see a spike in en­quiries for suc­ces­sion plan­ning or draft­ing of wills fol­low­ing such events,” she says.</p>
    <p>2. Many peo­ple feel there is no need for them to do a will be­cause they are not wealthy and their fam­ily units are small, com­pris­ing, say, a cou­ple and their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>While it is true that suc­ces­sion plan­ning can get more com­pli­cated for peo­ple with high net worth, there are nev­er­the­less risks, es­pe­cially to the wel­fare of chil­dren, as cases cited here have shown.</p>
    <p>3. There are also peo­ple who do not have a will done sim­ply be­cause they do not know the im­por­tance of one or how to get it done.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who are do­ing suc­ces­sion plan­ning for the first time can start grad­u­ally by get­ting the ba­sics done, such as by nom­i­nat­ing ben­e­fi­cia­ries for their in­surance poli­cies and CPF, says Ms Sim.</p>
    <p>These tasks can be done sim­ply by fol­low­ing the in­struc­tions from the CPF and their in­sur­ers.</p>
    <p>Next on the cards could be get­ting le­gal help to do a sim­ple will and a Last­ing Power of At­tor­ney.</p>
    <p>“These will form the foun­da­tion upon which they can build on for their suc­ces­sion plan­ning as wealth, fam­ily and cir­cum­stances change,” notes Ms Sim.</p>
