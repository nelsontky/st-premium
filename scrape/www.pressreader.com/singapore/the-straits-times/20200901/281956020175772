    <p>BAGUIO (Philip­pines) • An­chor Dho­bie de Guz­man has been the face of a pop­u­lar news show in the north­ern Philip­pines for more than a decade.</p>
    <p>Now the clo­sure of his re­gional station – and dozens of oth­ers coun­try­wide – has left him out of work. He is among hun­dreds of jour­nal­ists to lose their jobs at ABS-CBN as the broad­cast­ing gi­ant – a critic of Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte – slashes its op­er­a­tions af­ter ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enues were rav­aged by the loss of its free-to-air li­cence in May.</p>
    <p>The clo­sure of 53 re­gional tele­vi­sion and ra­dio sta­tions that broad­cast in six lan­guages will de­prive millions of Filipinos of their main source of lo­cal news and en­ter­tain­ment.</p>
    <p>“It’s painful,” Mr De Guz­man, 43, told AFP last Fri­day af­ter pre­sent­ing the fi­nal TV Pa­trol North Lu­zon in a stu­dio 240km from the cap­i­tal Manila.</p>
    <p>“You do your job re­spon­si­bly, you do your share to change the life of or­di­nary peo­ple, then at the end of the day, you lose your plat­form to do that.”</p>
    <p>Congress last month re­jected ABS-CBN’s ap­pli­ca­tion for a new 25-year fran­chise and a Supreme Court pe­ti­tion over the is­sue was dis­missed.</p>
    <p>ABS-CBN, which is owned by the wealthy Lopez fam­ily, has broad­cast con­tin­u­ously since 1953 ex­cept be­tween 1972 and 1986 when it was seized by the late dic­ta­tor Fer­di­nand Mar­cos – who Mr Duterte ad­mires.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte has a his­tory of clash­ing with me­dia out­lets critical of his poli­cies, in­clud­ing his con­tro­ver­sial drug war that has killed thou­sands of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>While he has de­nied any in­volve­ment in Congress’ de­ci­sion to re­ject ABS-CBN’s ap­pli­ca­tion, he had pre­vi­ously pledged to block its li­cence re­newal.</p>
    <p>In the months since los­ing its free-to-air per­mit, ABS-CBN has kept show­ing many of its pop­u­lar news and drama pro­grammes on ca­ble TV and on­line. But much of the ad­ver­tis­ing rev­enue it used to rake in has been wiped out, forc­ing the broad­caster to dra­mat­i­cally cut costs.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the clo­sure of the re­gional sta­tions last Fri­day, more parts of the net­work were shut­tered yes­ter­day and many of its broad­cast­ing stars are ex­pected to move on.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of jobs – in­clud­ing staff and con­trac­tors – could be lost, ABS-CBN warned pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>For decades, ABS-CBN’s re­gional net­work has played a vi­tal role in broad­cast­ing in­for­ma­tion on nat­u­ral dis­as­ters, such as ty­phoons, and health crises – in­clud­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – to iso­lated com­mu­ni­ties that have lit­tle or no In­ter­net ac­cess. For many, it is their only source of news.</p>
    <p>Fishermen in some re­gions have long re­lied on their lo­cal broad­caster to know if it was safe to go out to sea.</p>
    <p>The For­eign Cor­re­spon­dents As­so­ci­a­tion of the Philip­pines has de­scribed the clo­sure of ABS-CBN’s re­gional sta­tions as a “black day for in­de­pen­dent me­dia” in the coun­try. “It’s an avoid­able na­tional tragedy, in­flicted by the very peo­ple who should pro­tect Filipinos from all ad­ver­sity,” it said.</p>
    <p>ABS-CBN is al­lowed to file a fresh pe­ti­tion, but its suc­cess would re­quire mem­bers of Congress, dom­i­nated by Mr Duterte’s al­lies and whose terms ex­pire in 2022, to change their minds.</p>
    <p>For now, they are mourn­ing the loss of their net­work. “It’s not just a chan­nel... it’s a re­la­tion­ship, a con­nec­tion that has been lost,” said Mr Stan­ley Pal­isada, who was head of the re­gional news group.</p>
