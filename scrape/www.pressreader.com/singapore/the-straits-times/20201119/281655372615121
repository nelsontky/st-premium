    <p>BEI­JING/NEW YORK • Si­no­vac Biotech’s ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 vac­cine trig­gered a quick im­mune re­sponse, but the level of an­ti­bod­ies pro­duced was lower than in peo­ple who had re­cov­ered from the dis­ease, pre­lim­i­nary trial re­sults showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>While the early to mid-stage tri­als were not de­signed to as­sess the ef­fi­cacy of the vac­cine, known as Coron­aVac, re­searchers said it could pro­vide suf­fi­cient pro­tec­tion, based on their ex­pe­ri­ence with other vac­cines and data from pre-clin­i­cal stud­ies with macaques.</p>
    <p>The study comes hot on the heels of up­beat news this month from United States drug­mak­ers Pfizer and Moderna that showed their ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines were over 90 per cent ef­fec­tive, based on in­terim data from large, late-stage tri­als.</p>
    <p>Coron­aVac and four other ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cines de­vel­oped i n China are un­der­go­ing late-stage tri­als to de­ter­mine their ef­fec­tive­ness in pre­vent­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The Si­no­vac find­ings, pub­lished in a peer-re­viewed pa­per in med­i­cal jour­nal The Lancet In­fec­tious Dis­eases, came from re­sults in phase one and phase two clin­i­cal tri­als in China in­volv­ing more than 700 par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>“Our find­ings show that Coron­aVac is ca­pa­ble of in­duc­ing a quick an­ti­body re­sponse within four weeks of im­mu­ni­sa­tion by giv­ing two doses of the vac­cine at a 14-day in­ter­val,” said Pro­fes­sor Zhu Feng­cai, one of the au­thors of the pa­per.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that this makes the vac­cine suit­able for emer­gency use dur­ing the pan­demic,” Prof Zhu said in a state­ment pub­lished along­side the pa­per.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers said the find­ings from large, late-stage stud­ies, or phase three tri­als, would be cru­cial to de­ter­mine if the im­mune re­sponse gen­er­ated by Coron­aVac was suf­fi­cient to pro­tect peo­ple</p>
    <p>from the coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Si­no­vac is cur­rently run­ning three phase three tri­als – in In­done­sia, Brazil and Turkey.</p>
    <p>Dr Naor Bar-Zeev from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity, who was not in­volved in the study, said the re­sults must be in­ter­preted with cau­tion un­til phase three re­sults are pub­lished. “But even then, after phase three trial com­ple­tion and after li­cen­sure, we should pru­dently re­main cau­tious,” he said.</p>
    <p>Coron­aVac is one of three ex­per­i­men­tal Covid-19 vac­cines that China has been us­ing to in­oc­u­late hun­dreds of thou­sands of peo­ple un­der an emer­gency-use pro­gramme. The other two are de­vel­oped by in­sti­tutes linked to Chi­nese phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Sinopharm.</p>
    <p>The Sinopharm vac­cines, as well as an­other one from CanSino Bi­o­log­ics, were also shown to be safe and trig­gered im­mune re­sponses in early and mid-stage tri­als, ac­cord­ing to peer-re­viewed pa­pers.</p>
    <p>Dr Gang Zeng, a Si­no­vac re­searcher in­volved in the Coron­aVac study, said the vac­cine could be an at­trac­tive op­tion as it can be stored at nor­mal fridge tem­per­a­tures of 2 deg C to 8 deg C and may re­main sta­ble for up to three years. “(It) would of­fer some ad­van­tages for dis­tri­bu­tion to re­gions where ac­cess to re­frig­er­a­tion is chal­leng­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>An­other promis­ing vac­cine can­di­date be­ing de­vel­oped by French drug­maker Sanofi would not need to be su­per-cooled either.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, vac­cines de­vel­oped</p>
    <p>by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna use a new tech­nol­ogy called syn­thetic mes­sen­ger RNA to ac­ti­vate the im­mune sys­tem against the virus and re­quire far colder stor­age.</p>
    <p>Pfizer’s vac­cine must be stored and trans­ported at mi­nus 70 deg C, though it can be kept in a nor­mal fridge for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a ther­mal ship­ping box. Moderna’s vac­cine is ex­pected to be sta­ble at nor­mal fridge tem­per­a­tures for 30 days but for stor­age of up to six months, it needs to be kept at mi­nus 20 deg C.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Pfizer’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Al­bert Bourla said on Tues­day that the firm plans to sub­mit its vac­cine data to the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion for emer­gency-use au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
