    <p>Leaf Town started in the au­tumn, dur­ing re­cess. To re­open for in-per­son learn­ing, the small el­e­men­tary school had adopted new pro­to­cols to pre­vent the spread of Covid-19, and one of those meant that the play­ground equip­ment in the nearby park was off lim­its. With their recre­ational rou­tine dis­rupted, the chil­dren were briefly at a loss.</p>
    <p>Then some of them piled up fallen leaves to out­line the walls of a small room. They named it the Ev­ery­thing Store, and they be­gan trans­act­ing com­merce: purely imag­i­nary at first, then in­creas­ingly real.</p>
    <p>A town sprang up around it. So-and-so added a ho­tel, now there was a bank, some­one built big houses, some­one built lit­tle ones – what­ever ser­vices and fa­cil­i­ties the chil­dren deemed es­sen­tial. The struc­tures looked like aerial views of an­cient vil­lages where only foun­da­tions re­main.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren es­tab­lished their own cur­rency: ginkgo, a rare but at­tain­able leaf with a dis­tinct shape that would pre­sum­ably be hard to coun­ter­feit. The town thrived for weeks with a brisk trade in de­tri­tus: twigs, a charm from a way­ward bracelet, Nerf darts found in the weeds. A bro­ken pen­cil might cost 10 leaves, a ten­nis ball, 100.</p>
    <p>The sale of pre­cious finds like a Match­box car, a dis­carded gym­nas­tics medal and a travel-size hand sani­tiser might wipe out the money sup­ply, re­quir­ing the banker to make an­other trip to the ginkgo tree. The town boomed.</p>
    <p>We learnt about Leaf Town from Rose, nine years old, a pupil at the school, re­spec­tively our daugh­ter and niece.</p>
    <p>We imag­ined that this was how most towns de­vel­oped. A suit­able lo­ca­tion was cho­sen, and then, as more joined the com­mu­nity, needs for spe­cialised shops and ameni­ties arose and were met.</p>
    <p>Stuck like the rest of us in one spot by the pan­demic, the chil­dren were con­struct­ing some­thing dense, lovely and strange, watch­ing it take shape from their col­lec­tive imag­i­na­tions, seem­ingly ac­cord­ing to its own will.</p>
    <p>THE RULES</p>
    <p>“I guess it was so­ci­ety,” Rose said. “There were rules, some­times a lot of them.”</p>
    <p>New­com­ers had to have a good job and enough cap­i­tal to open a restau­rant or to be­gin con­struc­tion on a beauty shop or hos­pi­tal. “When I first came to Leaf Town, I didn’t know what was what,” Rose said, “so I ac­ci­den­tally walked through one of their houses, and ev­ery­one got mad at me. So that be­came a new rule: no tres­pass­ing. But it was fun, so I thought, ‘I will join you!’ ”</p>
    <p>In the mid-20th cen­tury, an in­flu­en­tial Euro­pean avant-garde group called the Si­t­u­a­tion­ist In­ter­na­tional pro­posed a city with build­ings that could change con­stantly at the whim of its in­hab­i­tants, a city in which work would be re­placed by play, or be in­dis­tin­guish­able from it.</p>
    <p>The group’s main ar­chi­tec­tural the­o­rist Con­stant Nieuwen­huys wrote in 1963 of fu­ture city-dwellers who would “be present at an un­in­ter­rupted process of cre­ation and re-cre­ation, sus­tained by a gen­er­alised cre­ativ­ity that is man­i­fested in all do­mains of ac­tiv­ity”.</p>
    <p>What the Si­t­u­a­tion­ists sought, in essence, was a way for adults to re­gain ac­cess to the ex­cite­ment of Leaf Town.</p>
    <p>In the mid­dle of an iso­lat­ing pan­demic, these chil­dren were cre­at­ing a vi­brant kind of life that many adults didn’t be­lieve was pos­si­ble, even be­fore Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We played be­cause ev­ery­one could be part of it,” Rose said. “It’s not as much fun to go out and find trea­sures on your own. It was more fun to search for trea­sures in the park, and bring them back to the Ev­ery­thing Store, and sell them there.”</p>
    <p>By now you have prob­a­bly no­ticed that we’ve been re­fer­ring to Leaf Town in the past tense.</p>
    <p>THE ROB­BERS</p>
    <p>It didn’t take long for the rob­beries to start. “The rob­bers tricked us,” Rose ex­plained. “They looked like nor­mal kids, and then when we took our money out, they would grab all our leaves and run. It made me sad, and pretty mad.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore the spate of rob­beries, the chil­dren had left their stashes of trin­kets and leaf cur­rency out at the park overnight, se­creted un­der trees or bushes. Now it seemed that one child, then two, then many had to be­come po­lice of­fi­cers: an en­tire force. A jail was also needed.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren be­gan hoard­ing their cur­rency, stuff­ing it into lunch­boxes, gloves and socks. They had be­come ob­ses­sive. The teach­ers put an end to the game.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren then switched to play­ing Leaf Town only af­ter class had ended each day. This was when the out­siders came – older chil­dren from dif­fer­ent schools.</p>
    <p>A group of boys moved men­ac­ingly in Leaf Town’s once peace­ful streets, car­ry­ing large sticks. They de­clared they would de­stroy what the chil­dren had built. “These kids can’t stay here for­ever,” they taunted. This made the chil­dren want to stay for­ever.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren had in­vented Leaf Town dur­ing a body-threat­en­ing pan­demic; they’d kept it safe from the ex­ter­nal world, but were their ef­forts doomed to fall vic­tim to their fel­low hu­mans?</p>
    <p>Watch­ing from the perime­ter with other par­ents and guardians, we felt tempted to in­ter­vene, but the chil­dren had to fig­ure things out them­selves. We held our tongues, but stayed close enough to jump in if things got too sticky.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren set up a watch, keep­ing an eye on the boys hell-bent on de­stroy­ing their town. But one by one the chil­dren had to go home, for din­ner or to Zoom mu­sic lessons, and Leaf Town was left de­fence­less.</p>
    <p>THE DE­STRUC­TION</p>
    <p>In­evitably, when we checked the park on the way to school one morn­ing, we found that the boys had car­ried out their threat.</p>
    <p>A group of girls, in­clud­ing Rose and her close friends, built Leaf Town back, smaller than be­fore. Fewer kids wanted to play; the in­ter­est in com­merce that spawned the Ev­ery­thing Store had now shifted to the bur­geon­ing re­cess vogue of trad­ing stick­ers. But the main part of the town was re­stored, ris­ing once again from the ma­te­rial that na­ture pro­vided.</p>
    <p>Rose tried to un­der­stand the boys’ de­struc­tive im­pulse: the part of hu­man­ity that feels com­pelled and en­ti­tled to do harm and break things be­cause they them­selves feel hurt, con­fused or un­der­val­ued.</p>
    <p>This is the part of Amer­ica – of the world – that we strug­gle to ex­plain. We tell Rose that those among us who re­ject peace and beauty are small in num­ber, and that if greeted with kind­ness and given the op­por­tu­nity, these peo­ple might change. We tell her that it’s vi­tal to keep work­ing to­wards jus­tice and the com­mon good, to keep act­ing hon­ourably, even when faced with the prospect of sense­less dev­as­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>We found the lessons of Leaf Town dispir­it­ing at first. The town’s col­lapse had come not only from one swift blow, but through slow degra­da­tion that fol­lowed the wan­ing of mu­tual trust.</p>
    <p>But in the weeks af­ter the sack of Leaf Town, the chil­dren re­dis­cov­ered and re-en­vi­sioned their com­mu­nity. The set­tlers came back home. What­ever else it taught the chil­dren and their guardians, Leaf Town left us with the les­son that hu­man so­ci­eties are prac­ti­cal and re­silient even – or es­pe­cially – in times of global cri­sis, when the im­pulse to look out only for one­self is demon­stra­bly dis­as­trous.</p>
    <p>As we try to en­vi­sion the world we want to re­build, we shouldn’t overlook the sig­nif­i­cance of some care­fully ar­ranged piles of leaves.</p>
