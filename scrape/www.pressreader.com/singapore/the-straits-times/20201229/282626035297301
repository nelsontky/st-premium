    <p>Malaysian singer Fish Leong broke into tears on stage two nights in a row.</p>
    <p>Leong, 42, held two con­certs at the Taipei Arena last Satur­day and Sun­day, re­turn­ing to the venue for the first time in five years and draw­ing 28,000 fans over two days.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Leong in­vited her good friend, singer Cheer Chen, as her guest singer.</p>
    <p>It was the first time they were on the same stage in 14 years and they sang When I Love You, the theme song from the ro­man­tic film This Is Not What I Ex­pected (2017), which starred Takeshi Kaneshiro and Zhou Dongyu.</p>
    <p>Chen, 45, said after the per­for­mance that it felt like get­ting mar­ried, while Leong joked that she was smit­ten by Chen.</p>
    <p>After Leong per­formed her hit song Un­for­tu­nately Not You, she squat­ted on the stage and wept for close to one minute be­fore she stood up slowly and thanked her fans.</p>
    <p>She also thanked some im­por­tant peo­ple in her life, in­clud­ing her men­tor Jonathan Lee, and good friends, singers Penny Tai and Chen.</p>
    <p>Leong joked later and said she should have brought toi­let pa­per if she had known it would turn out this way.</p>
    <p>She had also cried last Satur­day while singing her song Break Up Hap­pily. Leong di­vorced her hus­band of nine years, Tai­wanese busi­ness­man Tony Chao, last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Tai­wanese me­dia, her new boyfriend, Tai­wanese en­tre­pre­neur Dar­win Lin, did not tell her which day he would turn up for the con­cert so that she would not be dis­tracted. The me­dia did not spot him at the con­certs.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he sent a rose bas­ket with her name hid­den in­side the note and mes­saged her to en­cour­age her be­fore the con­certs.</p>
