    <p>• DoorDash, the big­gest Amer­i­can food de­liv­ery com­pany, is seek­ing to raise as much as US$2.8 bil­lion (S$3.8 bil­lion) in an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) that is part of an endof-year US list­ings rush.</p>
    <p>The San Fran­cisco-based com­pany said in a fil­ing on Mon­day that it plans to sell 33 mil­lion shares for US$75 to US$85 each.</p>
    <p>At the top end of this range, the com­pany could be val­ued at about US$32 bil­lion. This fig­ure is an in­crease from that in June when pri­vate in­vestors val­ued it at about US$16 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The IPO price range could still change de­pend­ing on de­mand for its stock dur­ing its road­show with in­vestors over the next week.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the list­ing, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Tony Xu will hold al­most 42 per cent of DoorDash’s Class B su­per-vot­ing shares, which have 20 votes each. He also has vot­ing con­trol over the rest of the 20-vote shares, which are split be­tween his co-founders Stan­ley Tang and Andy Fang.</p>
    <p>They will con­trol about 79 per cent of the vot­ing power, ac­cord­ing to the fil­ing.</p>
    <p>SoftBank Group’s Vi­sion Fund will be the largest out­side in­vestor, with 25 per cent of the Class A shares.</p>
    <p>Ven­ture cap­i­tal firm Se­quoia will own more than 20 per cent and Sin­ga­pore’s GIC will own 10.5 per cent, ac­cord­ing to the fil­ings.</p>
    <p>That will add up to less than 16 per cent of the vot­ing power be­cause of the Class B shares held by the founders.</p>
    <p>DoorDash is cur­rently plan­ning to hold the IPO next Tues­day, with its trad­ing de­but on the New York Stock Ex­change the fol­low­ing day, said a per­son fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter who asked not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause it was not pub­lic.</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for DoorDash de­clined to com­ment on that tim­ing.</p>
    <p>DoorDash is part of a cadre of con­sumer-ori­ented, Web-based com­pa­nies led by home-ren­tal plat­form Airbnb that have lined up IPOs for this month.</p>
    <p>They in­clude video-game com­pany Roblox, in­stal­ment loans provider Af­firm Hold­ings and Con­tex­tLogic, par­ent of on­line dis­count re­tailer Wish.</p>
    <p>For the first nine months of the year, DoorDash had US$1.9 bil­lion in sales, more than triple the US$587 mil­lion dur­ing the same pe­riod last year. Its net loss nar­rowed to US$149 mil­lion, com­pared with US$533 mil­lion for the pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>DoorDash was briefly prof­itable in the se­cond quar­ter of this year – at the height of the stay-at-home or­ders in ma­jor US cities – post­ing US$23 mil­lion in profit.</p>
    <p>Its of­fer­ing is be­ing led by Gold­man Sachs Group and JPMor­gan Chase, with Bar­clays, Deutsche Bank, RBC Cap­i­tal Mar­kets and UBS Group.</p>
