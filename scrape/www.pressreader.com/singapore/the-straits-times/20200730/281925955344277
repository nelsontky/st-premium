    <p>On Hari Raya Haji to­mor­row, In­done­sian farmer Pawit will be don­ning a face shield, mask, gloves and gog­gles to carry out the an­nual Mus­lim rit­ual of animal sac­ri­fice known as kor­ban.</p>
    <p>To­gether with a small team from the Na­tional Board of Zakat, a non­struc­tural gov­ern­ment agency known lo­cally as Baz­nas, Mr Pawit, who like many In­done­sians goes by one name, will slaugh­ter the live­stock in a butch­ery near his vil­lage in Mage­lang re­gency, Cen­tral Java, as a cam­era clicks away.</p>
    <p>Photos of the cat­tle, sheep and goats will be sent to the donors as proof of the sac­ri­fice, and the meat, which is a form of alms, will be dis­trib­uted to the doorsteps of the poor and needy.</p>
    <p>“In the past, vil­lagers were able to gather and watch the rit­ual and the poor would per­son­ally come to col­lect the meat. But we must fol­low strict health mea­sures be­cause of the coron­avirus,” the 47-year-old told The Straits Times. “I feel sad, but also grate­ful that at least this im­por­tant rit­ual is not can­celled.”</p>
    <p>For Mus­lims, kor­ban com­mem­o­rates Prophet Ibrahim’s will­ing­ness to sac­ri­fice his son Ish­mael for the sake of Al­lah. Al­lah, in turn, re­placed Ish­mael with a ram to recog­nise Ibrahim’s obe­di­ence.</p>
    <p>As the global pan­demic rages on, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion last</p>
    <p>Satur­day pub­lished a list of safe prac­tices, in­clud­ing us­ing vir­tual plat­forms such as tele­vi­sion, ra­dio and so­cial me­dia to re­strict so­cial and re­li­gious gath­er­ings, as well as ob­serv­ing phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing in meat dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, the world’s most­pop­u­lous Mus­lim coun­try with 270 mil­lion peo­ple, the Re­li­gious Af­fairs Min­istry has banned pub­lic celebratio­ns in un­safe zones with a high in­ci­dence of cases.</p>
    <p>While the coun­try’s main mosque, the grand Is­tiqlal Mosque in Cen­tral Jakarta, will be closed, mosques that re­main open have been ad­vised to keep con­gre­ga­tional prayers short and ster­ilise their premises. Wor­ship­pers must also wear face masks and bring their own prayer mats.</p>
    <p>Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tions and on­line mar­ket­places have also been of­fer­ing spe­cial kor­ban ser­vices on­line.</p>
    <p>Through web­sites and apps, Mus­lims can buy live cat­tle, goats or sheep from lo­cal breed­ers and have the slaugh­tered meat de­liv­ered to the poor and dis­ad­van­taged.</p>
    <p>While some of these have been op­er­at­ing for sev­eral years, the dif­fer­ence this year is in the slaugh­ter­ing process. In­stead of in mosques and pub­lic spa­ces, the sac­ri­fice rit­ual will be car­ried out at slaugh­ter­houses by smaller teams.</p>
    <p>Crowds will also be barred from watch­ing the process on site.</p>
    <p>Baz­nas has joined hands with banks, elec­tronic pay­ment operators and on­line mar­ket­places to pro­vide the kor­ban ser­vice and is us­ing so­cial me­dia plat­forms to reach out to donors, its ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Mo­hamad Arifin Pur­wakananta told ST.</p>
    <p>This year, he hopes to re­ceive 25 per cent of the alms funds, in­clud­ing from animal sac­ri­fice rit­u­als, from on­line chan­nels, up from last year’s fig­ure of 15 per cent.</p>
    <p>“Dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy aside, we must ob­serve the health pre­cau­tions as best as we can and en­sure we per­form the kor­ban in ac­cor­dance with Is­lamic laws,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Hari Raya is a happy day for Mus­lims, a day to cel­e­brate. We will be livestream­ing the sac­ri­fice rit­ual so peo­ple can still wit­ness it on­line.”</p>
    <p>In­done­sian on­line fund-rais­ing plat­form Kitabisa.com, which has been of­fer­ing kor­ban ser­vices vir­tu­ally for the last five years, has tied up with 11 part­ners to per­form the rit­ual in In­done­sia and abroad, in­clud­ing in Pales­tine, Syria and So­ma­lia.</p>
    <p>Ms Fara De­vana, the plat­form’s pub­lic re­la­tions man­ager, told ST that the plat­form has re­ceived 4,200 or­ders as of Tues­day, and ex­pects more in the com­ing days. Last year, there were 4,600 or­ders.</p>
    <p>“We act as a bridge for the thou­sands of peo­ple who want to do good by util­is­ing tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ments,” she said.</p>
