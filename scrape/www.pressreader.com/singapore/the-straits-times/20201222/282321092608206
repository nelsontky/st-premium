    <p>Fol­low­ing a more than two-year­long failed re­struc­tur­ing at­tempt that has seen a num­ber of sur­pris­ing twists, trou­bled wa­ter treat­ment firm Hyflux and its unit Hy­drochem ended the year un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment and its founder Olivia Lum los­ing con­trol of the com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>At is­sue now is whether the long­suf­fer­ing cred­i­tors of Hyflux, in­clud­ing some 34,000 re­tail in­vestors hold­ing its per­pet­ual se­cu­ri­ties and pref­er­ence shares (PnP), will fi­nally get a re­struc­tur­ing deal with terms they are pre­pared to ac­cept.</p>
    <p>Or will the com­pany be liq­ui­dated if no vi­able deal is struck? This will mean that the re­tail in­vestors, who are owed about $900 mil­lion, will end up with noth­ing.</p>
    <p>Ju­di­cial man­age­ment is Hyflux’s last chance to turn around be­fore liq­ui­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Since its ap­point­ment by the High Court last month, re­struc­tur­ing firm Bor­relli Walsh has lost lit­tle time un­der­tak­ing a re­view of the fi­nan­cial and op­er­a­tional af­fairs of Hyflux, Hy­drochem and their units.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes pro­tect­ing the com­pa­nies’ books and records, se­cur­ing their cash and en­sur­ing the con­tin­u­a­tion of their projects’ op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Bor­relli Walsh has been ad­vis­ing an un­se­cured work­ing group (UWG) of 19 banks that hold more than $931 mil­lion of Hyflux debt, and which had pe­ti­tioned for the com­pany to be placed un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>In their lat­est up­date, the ju­di­cial man­agers said they are in talks with 14 new po­ten­tial in­vestors, con­tacted five in­vestors that had pre­vi­ously ex­pressed an in­ter­est in Hyflux and Hy­drochem, and aim to iden­tify a suit­able in­vestor by the end of next month.</p>
    <p>But the ju­di­cial man­agers said they are un­able to dis­close the iden­ti­ties of th­ese in­vestors at this early stage.</p>
    <p>Many cred­i­tors, par­tic­u­larly the PnP re­tail in­vestors, are also keenly watch­ing what Bor­relli Walsh’s in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the Hyflux board and ad­vis­ers will flush out.</p>
    <p>This af­ter Ms Lum and the rest of the board were re­lieved of their author­ity – a move some ob­servers say is long over­due, es­pe­cially with Hyflux and its cur­rent and for­mer di­rec­tors now un­der probe for sus­pected false and mis­lead­ing state­ments and breaches of dis­clo­sure rules.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing given 12 extensions of the debt mora­to­rium over 21/ years, the Hyflux board was no</p>
    <p>2 closer to getting a deal that puts money on the ta­ble, and some cred­i­tors feared the group’s re­main­ing value was be­ing dis­si­pated.</p>
    <p>As the probe in­ten­si­fies, ques­tions are be­ing raised over whether the re­struc­tur­ing had</p>
    <p>been con­ducted prop­erly and if the Hyflux board dealt with so-called white-knight in­vestors Aqua Munda and Pi­son In­vest­ments, the in­vest­ment ve­hi­cle of In­done­sian mag­nate Johnny Wid­jaja, on an “arm’s length ba­sis”.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Eddee Ng, who rep­re­sents the UWG, asked at a High Court hear­ing for a ju­di­cial man­age­ment order last month why Pi­son’s and Aqua Munda’s of­fers were con­tin­gent on no ju­di­cial man­age­ment be­ing in place and why the Hyflux board should re­main when it is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ob­servers also pointed out that the “terms of the bid­ders’ in­vi­ta­tion mem­o­ran­dums are al­most iden­ti­cal, with both in­volv­ing a re­verse Dutch auc­tion, which is geared to­wards min­imis­ing re­turns to cred­i­tors by re­quir­ing them to bid each other down. This is in con­trast to the pri­mary ob­jec­tive – the max­imi­sa­tion of cred­i­tor re­cov­er­ies”.</p>
    <p>Re­cov­ery rates of­fered by white knights sup­ported by the board have been pal­try – the lat­est from Amer­i­can fund man­ager Strate­gic Growth In­vest­ments rep­re­sents a re­cov­ery of just four cents on the dol­lar for re­tail in­vestors.</p>
    <p>Hope­fully, the ju­di­cial man­ager can work a mir­a­cle for the 34,000 mom-and-pop in­vestors who de­serve bet­ter than to see their hard­earned sav­ings go up in smoke.</p>
