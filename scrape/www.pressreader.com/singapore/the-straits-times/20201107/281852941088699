    <p>When Hong Kong Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam post­poned a ma­jor pol­icy speech last month, citing the need to first con­sult with the cen­tral gov­ern­ment, it rep­re­sented a shift in the way pol­icy is be­ing made in the Asian fi­nan­cial hub and the in­creas­ing in­te­gra­tion of the city with the main­land.</p>
    <p>It is yet an­other sign of the ad­min­is­tra­tion’s grow­ing de­pen­dence on Bei­jing, an­a­lysts said.</p>
    <p>The Chief Ex­ec­u­tive on Tues­day led a del­e­ga­tion in­clud­ing five min­is­ters – those in charge of health, tech­nol­ogy, trans­port, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and main­land af­fairs – to the cap­i­tal for talks on mea­sures to re­vive the Hong Kong econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the trip, she met of­fi­cials from var­i­ous bod­ies in­clud­ing the se­cu­ri­ties com­mis­sion, civil avi­a­tion au­thor­ity, Na­tional De­vel­op­ment and Re­form Com­mis­sion, Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion and Com­merce Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam yes­ter­day also had an au­di­ence with Vice-Premier Han Zheng, the top of­fi­cial in charge of Hong Kong and Ma­cau af­fairs, who pledged Bei­jing’s sup­port for the city and its in­te­gra­tion into the coun­try and the over­all de­vel­op­ment of the Greater Bay Area, a group­ing of nine south­ern Chi­nese cities, Hong Kong and Ma­cau.</p>
    <p>But when asked dur­ing a press con­fer­ence wrap­ping up her Bei­jing visit, Mrs Lam stopped short of elab­o­rat­ing what had been dis­cussed, say­ing more will be re­vealed on Nov 25, the new date for her pol­icy ad­dress.</p>
    <p>The meet­ings do not re­flect whether the cen­tral gov­ern­ment “feels we are do­ing well or not well be­cause this is an on­go­ing process”, she said in re­sponse to a ques­tion from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure that you’ll ap­pre­ci­ate that eco­nomic progress is an on­go­ing evo­lu­tion­ary process. There’s al­ways this urge to do bet­ter in our eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment.”</p>
    <p>Yet crit­ics say the fact that Mrs Lam de­layed what is one of the two most im­por­tant speeches on the Hong Kong po­lit­i­cal cal­en­dar – the other is the an­nual gov­ern­ment bud­get – is in­dica­tive of the city’s de­creas­ing au­ton­omy.</p>
    <p>“Hong Kong’s au­ton­omy comes from mak­ing their own laws and pol­icy but we’ve seen this year that they’ve had a law made for them in Bei­jing, and now the need to con­sult with se­nior of­fi­cials be­fore they an­nounce their plans for the year,” said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Al­fred Wu of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Pol­icy, re­fer­ring to the na­tional se­cu­rity law that was passed by China’s Par­lia­ment in end June.</p>
    <p>In the past, Hong Kong’s lead­ers worked with civil ser­vants in plan­ning for the year ahead. They would then no­tify Bei­jing’s li­ai­son of­fice in the city, which would green-light the process – a man­i­fes­ta­tion of the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” pol­icy at work, where Hong Kong demon­strated its au­ton­omy, Prof Wu said.</p>
    <p>An ST count found that since Mrs Lam took of­fice in 2017, she has made 19 trips to the main­land, more than any other pre­vi­ous</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive, many of them con­sul­ta­tive meet­ings with se­nior lead­er­ship ei­ther in Bei­jing or Shen­zhen.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam’s re­cent visit is yet an­other in­di­ca­tion that she has less power than any pre­vi­ous Hong Kong leader be­cause she ap­pears to be con­sult­ing Bei­jing on ev­ery area, said Dr Willy Lam, pro­fes­sor at the Cen­tre for China Stud­ies at the Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>While it is pos­si­ble that she is try­ing to avoid con­tra­dict­ing the cen­tral gov­ern­ment’s re­cently un­veiled Five-Year Plan and a blue­print for the Greater Bay Area, these are also un­prece­dented times in which the city’s econ­omy re­quires help from the main­land.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to party rec­om­men­da­tions on Tues­day re­gard­ing the 2021-2025 plan, Bei­jing would sup­port Hong Kong and Ma­cau in re­in­forc­ing their com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tages to­wards be­com­ing a global tech­nol­ogy hub.</p>
    <p>It also vowed to stop ex­ter­nal forces med­dling in Hong Kong or Ma­cau af­fairs as part of a strat­egy to strengthen na­tional iden­tity and pa­tri­o­tism in the two cities over the next five years.</p>
