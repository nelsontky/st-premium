    <p>BERLIN • Ger­many has recorded its high­est num­ber of new coro­n­avirus cases i n nearly four months, prompt­ing Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel to rule out any fur­ther loos­en­ing of steps to curb the spread of the pan­demic amid fears of a resur­gence of in­fec­tions across Europe.</p>
    <p>There were 1,693 new Ger­man cases in the 24 hours through yes­ter­day morn­ing, the most since April 25, ac­cord­ing to data from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity. That took the coun­try’s over­all tally of in­fec­tions to 225,404. The re­ported death toll rose by four to 9,236.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of daily cases reached al­most 7,000 at the peak of the pan­demic in the spring.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel said that a dou­bling in the num­ber of daily cases in Ger­many in the last three weeks must be ad­dressed. The re­cent trend “should not con­tinue and we need to con­tain it”, the Chan­cel­lor said in Dus­sel­dorf, adding that fines will need to be i mposed on peo­ple flaunt­ing hy­giene and so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules.</p>
    <p>“If we can man­age this, the good news is that there is a lot of pub­lic life that we can al­low to hap­pen,” Dr Merkel said.</p>
    <p>There have been a num­ber of out­breaks in re­cent weeks in set­tings such as larger fam­ily events and leisure ac­tiv­i­ties, as well as in ed­u­ca­tional and pro­fes­sional fa­cil­i­ties, ac­cord­ing to the coun­try’s Robert Koch In­sti­tute (RKI) for in­fec­tious dis­eases.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Jens Spahn sug­gested at the week­end that so­cial gath­er­ings should be lim­ited to close fam­ily mem­bers for the time be­ing.</p>
    <p>Ger­many’s re­pro­duc­tion fac­tor – or R value – dropped to 1.11 on Mon­day, from 1.21 the pre­vi­ous day, the lat­est report by the RKI pub­lic health in­sti­tute showed. That means 100 in­fected peo­ple are es­ti­mated to spread the disease to around 111 oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is try­ing to keep the in­fec­tion rate be­low 1.0 to pre­vent a fresh surge in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Across the con­ti­nent, of­fi­cials are al­ready tight­en­ing re­stric­tions on move­ment again in an ef­fort to pre­vent sum­mer partying and travel from spread­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>Spain and Italy have shut night­clubs and Greece has lim­ited hours for bars and restau­rants to try to avoid more dras­tic mea­sures after the hol­i­day sea­son winds down.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments are des­per­ate to fos­ter a re­cov­ery after ac­tiv­ity col­lapsed in the sec­ond quar­ter, but a fail­ure to act de­ci­sively to pre­vent a widespread resur­gence of the virus could mean more pain for the econ­omy later on.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the Ger­man econ­omy is cur­rently on a “re­cov­ery path” after the slump caused by the cri­sis and is ex­pected to “grow steeply” in the third quar­ter of the year, Ger­many’s cen­tral Deutsche Bun­des­bank said on Mon­day.</p>
