    <p>Al­most 40 years ago, I was head­ing a fish­net man­u­fac­tur­ing fac­tory in Nige­ria and just could not com­pete with lower-priced im­ports. A vil­lage elder saw my plight and promised to pro­vide me with in­sight into the ex­act size of fish in the sur­round­ing wa­ters each week.</p>
    <p>From that mo­ment on, each week, I was able to match the mesh size of my nets with the size of the fish in the wa­ter. Re­sult – my nets sim­ply caught more fish.</p>
    <p>I quickly de­signed a unique la­bel, and within a few months fish­er­men from far and wide would come car­ry­ing my la­bel look­ing for the nets that had spe­cial magic to catch more fish. The wisdom of the vil­lage elder had saved our com­pany from po­ten­tial clo­sure.</p>
    <p>WHAT IS ‘EL­DER­ING’?</p>
    <p>Be­ing an elder means a hu­man be­ing who is recog­nised by the com­mu­nity in which he lives as hav­ing some wisdom to of­fer on a con­tin­u­ing ba­sis which is per­ceived to be of value.</p>
    <p>It is not a func­tion of age. Get­ting older does not en­ti­tle us to be­come el­ders. The most crit­i­cal as­pect is the re­la­tion­ship of the elder with the com­mu­nity and the abil­ity to recog­nise the chal­lenges of the times.</p>
    <p>Abo­rig­ines of Aus­tralia and the Na­tive Amer­i­cans of the United States have been prac­tis­ing this art for a very long time. Asian cul­tures, too, have tapped the wisdom of el­ders.</p>
    <p>The El­der­ing In­sti­tute in the US refers to “el­der­ing” as “wisdom in ac­tion”. The phrase sug­gests that if we traf­fic in our ex­pe­ri­ence and the knowl­edge we have ac­crued with­out be­ing in ac­tion or with­out hav­ing the ca­pac­ity to inspire ac­tion in oth­ers, then our “wisdom” is lit­tle more than com­fort­ing and re­count­ing of mean­ing­less mem­o­ries.</p>
    <p>When the ac­tion stops, we be­come spec­ta­tors and be­gin the process of de­tach­ment and in­evitable de­cline. El­der­ing there­fore rep­re­sents the idea that even as we get older we can con­tinue to im­prove. This is so long as we con­tinue to be of ser­vice, and do not lose the abil­ity to cre­ate and sus­tain re­la­tion­ships with the com­mu­nity we live in.</p>
    <p>True el­ders are change-mak­ers, who can lead by ex­am­ple, cre­at­ing pos­i­tive so­cial change and in­spir­ing oth­ers to do the same.</p>
    <p>El­der­ing is a vi­sion for grow­ing older. It is an op­por­tu­nity to live the rest of one’s re­tired or not-re­tired life in a richer and more re­ward­ing way as a life of con­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>Of course, a great deal of what can be achieved de­pends on the abil­ity to en­gage in con­ver­sa­tions that will al­low the elder to as­sess the com­mu­nity’s needs and dilem­mas and share his wisdom to make a pos­i­tive dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>COUN­TRIES AND COM­PA­NIES</p>
    <p>Elder­hood is born out of a cul­ture and a way of life, whether it is a coun­try or an or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>It is not some­thing that you can en­force. It has to be a call­ing, an at­ti­tude, a state of mind that al­lows el­der­ing as a con­cept to be­come a tra­di­tion built around the telling of sto­ries that are rel­e­vant and teach valu­able life lessons.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, we have seen the cre­ation of the se­nior min­is­ter role where a wise and ex­pe­ri­enced leader con­tin­ues to con­trib­ute and share crit­i­cal mile­stones and defin­ing mo­ments of his­tory ex­pe­ri­enced that had an im­pact on de­ci­sion-mak­ing.</p>
    <p>Many years ago, ty­coon Richard Bran­son and rock star Peter Gabriel took their idea of el­der­ing to Mr Nel­son Man­dela, who on his 89th birth­day in 2007, founded “The El­ders”, an in­de­pen­dent group of global lead­ers work­ing to­gether to­wards peace, jus­tice and hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>To­day, the chair is Mrs Mary Robin­son, the first woman pres­i­dent of Ire­land, and her deputy is Mr Ban Ki-moon, the for­mer United Na­tions sec­re­tary-gen­eral. There are sev­eral other lead­ers, in­clud­ing Arch­bishop Des­mond Tutu, Mr Jimmy Carter, Ms Hina Ji­lani, Ms Ela Bhatt and Mr Kofi An­nan, who con­tinue to play an im­por­tant role.</p>
    <p>Th­ese global lead­ers are com­mit­ted to work­ing with lo­cal and indige­nous knowl­edge; to lis­ten­ing and bring­ing to­gether an­tag­o­nists and pro­tag­o­nists; and to work­ing with any­one who is mo­ti­vated to re­solve a prob­lem.</p>
    <p>They can help fos­ter and in­tro­duce in­no­va­tive ideas and lit­tle-known so­lu­tions to con­nect those who have real prac­ti­cal needs with those who have some­thing to give.</p>
    <p>A NEED IN SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>I can see the op­por­tu­nity in Sin­ga­pore now where there is a strong need for el­ders to step in and ad­dress the rather con­tentious is­sue of the grow­ing num­ber of for­eign­ers in our midst.</p>
    <p>They have the wisdom to ap­pre­ci­ate the needs of a small coun­try such as ours, punch­ing way above its weight in the global mar­kets, to keep grow­ing and sus­tain­ing its de­vel­op­ment and har­mo­nious life­style in all seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Lis­ten­ing to two dif­fer­ent, ap­par­ently con­flict­ing, per­spec­tives and rec­on­cil­ing them through the cre­ation of a mid­dle path needs the spir­i­tual ma­tu­rity and trust of the el­ders who have so much to of­fer.</p>
    <p>Canadian author Stephen Jenk­in­son, of Come Of Age: The Case For Elder­hood In A Time Of Trou­ble, be­lieves that while hu­mans are liv­ing longer than ever be­fore, they have lost the lead­er­ship and wisdom of el­ders. In a “work­ing” cul­ture, ev­ery­one alive would be an “elder in train­ing” whose char­ac­ter de­vel­ops not un­like a fine wine, he says.</p>
    <p>As our pop­u­la­tion ages, there is a strong case to en­sure that ev­ery­body un­der­stands the sub­tle dif­fer­ence be­tween get­ting old and be­com­ing an elder. Elder­hood is a func­tion rather than an iden­tity, it is not some­thing you earn be­cause you have be­come a grand­par­ent.</p>
    <p>In­tu­itively, as a lead­er­ship trans­for­ma­tion coach for the last 12 years work­ing with chief ex­ec­u­tives, I have been try­ing to recog­nise the pres­ence of po­ten­tial el­ders.</p>
    <p>Lead­ers, par­tic­u­larly the young ones liv­ing in a world that is con­stantly chang­ing and be­com­ing more com­plex, need to find ways to get cen­tred and grounded, will­ing to ex­per­i­ment and ex­plore, be­com­ing com­fort­able with not hav­ing an­swers and mak­ing mis­takes from which to learn. El­ders can help.</p>
    <p>To­day we are in the midst of cat­a­strophic change. We know it re­quires some­thing more than typ­i­cally throw­ing tech­ni­cal so­lu­tions to deal with adap­tive change. Or­gan­i­sa­tions, too, need to cre­ate a cul­ture where it be­comes pos­si­ble to iden­tify and recog­nise the el­ders in their midst, not based on age and ti­tle, but the wisdom and re­spon­sive­ness to the chang­ing times.</p>
    <p>Recog­nis­ing and iden­ti­fy­ing el­ders is a dif­fi­cult task be­cause there are no per­son­al­ity tests that can be taken to throw out a score for selec­tion. Mr Jenk­in­son says that it is the times that will dic­tate what elder­hood means right now, and this is dif­fer­ent for each coun­try and com­pany.</p>
    <p>Elder­hood is a cul­tural func­tion dic­tated by the en­light­ened spir­i­tual ma­tu­rity of lead­ers, who have an evolved mind that can re­main present to what is, rather than chas­ing what should be.</p>
    <p>This in­volves: Serv­ing freely as a chan­nel, rather than try­ing to stay in con­trol; re­spect­ing the mys­tery, rather than seek­ing cer­tainty; de­vel­op­ing an ap­petite for, and re­spect­ing once again, the lost tra­di­tion of elder­hood to help rec­on­cile the chal­lenges of du­al­i­ties; shar­ing the best of who we are; and hav­ing pur­pose­ful con­ver­sa­tions that mat­ter. This will make our jour­ney so much more re­ward­ing.</p>
