    <p>Pad­dling through Sungei Khatib Bongsu’s labyrinth of tree-shaded chan­nels feels a lit­tle like a mouse try­ing to find its way out of a maze, ex­cept that the tour was led by trained and qual­i­fied kayak guides who know ev­ery cen­time­tre of it.</p>
    <p>Hawk-eyed guides pointed out life forms hid­den among the green­ery and dis­pensed nuggets of in­for­ma­tion to the cu­ri­ous par­tic­i­pants.</p>
    <p>Ms Dawn Marie Lee, 45, was on the tour on Oct 14 with her son, Julien An­dre Chas­sin, 11, who had just fin­ished sit­ting the Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“It was a very stress­ful past few months so I thought this would be a good break for both of us to be out in na­ture, in a part of ‘hid­den’ Sin­ga­pore that we never knew ex­isted,” said Ms Lee, a writer.</p>
    <p>The man­grove tun­nel, Rhi­zophora flooded for­est and Avi­cenna flooded for­est were some of the high­lights of the tour run by kayaka­sia, an eco-ad­ven­ture travel com­pany, which started kayak tour­ing in 2000 in Sin­ga­pore, the Philip­pines, Thai­land and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Sungei Khatib Bongsu, which runs through a new na­ture park at Khatib Bongsu, is one of Sin­ga­pore’s last un­dammed rivers, and has one of the largest con­cen­tra­tions of man­groves east of the Cause­way along the is­land’s north­ern coast.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee added: “Get­ting caught be­tween the branches and roots in the ‘tight spots’ on the trail was tricky but fun. I also liked go­ing through the man­grove tun­nel be­cause it was sur­real and so peace­ful. See­ing the huge At­las moth up close for the first time in my life was a lovely sur­prise too.”</p>
    <p>The so-called man­grove tun­nel in the first sec­tion of the tour is the ef­fect of the trees on the sides of the man­grove creek lock­ing their branches, and each of the sec­tions of the tour has its own spe­cial feel.</p>
    <p>Man­groves are im­por­tant since they serve as nurs­eries for aquatic life and are nat­u­ral bar­ri­ers that pro­tect shore­lines from ero­sion.</p>
    <p>Some 185 species of birds, res­i­dent and mi­gra­tory, have been recorded in the Khatib Bongsu area. They com­prise about half of the to­tal num­ber of bird species in Sin­ga­pore (376, ac­cord­ing to NSS Pocket Check­list 2011), al­most equiv­a­lent to the tally recorded at Sungei Bu­loh Wet­land Re­serve, ac­cord­ing to Na­ture So­ci­ety (Sin­ga­pore) in 2013.</p>
    <p>In the next 10 years, the Na­tional Parks Board (NParks) will work with the com­mu­nity to trans­form Sin­ga­pore from a “city in a gar­den” to a “city in na­ture”, said then Se­cond Min­is­ter for Na­tional Devel­op­ment Des­mond Lee, dur­ing a de­bate on his min­istry’s bud­get on March 4 this year.</p>
    <p>The na­ture park net­work, which cur­rently cov­ers more than 350ha, will be ex­tended by 200ha by 2030. A 40ha na­ture park will be es­tab­lished at Khatib Bongsu, a rich man­grove and mud­flat habi­tat.</p>
    <p>“Khatib Bongsu should be pro­tected and de­vel­oped with a light touch. Keep it as nat­u­ral as pos­si­ble. To me, its at­trac­tion is its rel­a­tively ‘un­touched’ pris­tine na­ture, but do con­tinue to al­low kayak­ing and other non-pol­lu­tive ac­tiv­i­ties there,” said Mr Ross­man Ith­nain, 56, a for­mer civil ser­vant who was also on the tour with his wife.</p>
    <p>The Oct 14 tour was kayaka­sia’s first trip there af­ter the cir­cuit breaker in April and May. To com­ply with safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures set by Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board, each guide can take a max­i­mum of 10 guests, in sub-groups of not more than five. There were two guides lead­ing two sep­a­rate groups of 10 guests that day.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the cir­cuit breaker and with the travel ban, peo­ple are so ea­ger to re­dis­cover Sin­ga­pore,” said Mr Sim Cher Huey, 45, founder of kayaka­sia.</p>
