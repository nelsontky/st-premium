    <p>A group of Malaysian law­mak­ers is look­ing at mak­ing changes to the cur­rent elec­tion sys­tem to curb party hop­ping.</p>
    <p>The switch in po­lit­i­cal al­le­giances top­pled the fed­eral gov­ern­ment and five state gov­ern­ments in the last six months.</p>
    <p>FIRST-PAST-THE-POST SYS­TEM</p>
    <p>Un­der the cur­rent sys­tem – which is sim­i­lar to Sin­ga­pore’s – a can­di­date is picked by his po­lit­i­cal party to con­test in a con­stituency.</p>
    <p>In Malaysia this could be for a fed­eral ward or for a seat in one of the 13 state as­sem­blies.</p>
    <p>On vot­ing day, a per­son who en­ters a vot­ing booth is given a bal­lot pa­per. The voter is to mark a cross be­side the one party and its can­di­date that he favours. The can­di­date who gets the most votes, wins the seat.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem is also called the win­ner-takes-all sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The win­ning can­di­date rep­re­sents the vot­ers in bring­ing their as­pi­ra­tions to be leg­is­lated in the fed­eral Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>But one weak­ness of the cur­rent sys­tem is that the MP or state assem­bly­man who has won this seat could hop to an­other party or al­liance. This is be­cause the ward is des­ig­nated to the can­di­date and not the party.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the seat of the MP be­comes va­cant if he is ex­pelled or re­signs from the party for which he stood in the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In a party list sys­tem, sim­i­lar to that used in In­done­sia’s legislativ­e polls, vot­ers di­rectly pick the party that they wish to rep­re­sent them, and not the in­di­vid­ual can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, if there are 100 Par­lia­ment seats and a party wins 30 per cent of the to­tal vote, it will be given 30 seats. The seats are awarded to the party’s top lead­ers.</p>
    <p>But if this per­son were to hop to an­other party or al­liance, he does not bring over the seat. The 30 seats won by this party will re­main with it, with a new chief­tain cho­sen to re­place the politi­cian who had jumped to an­other side.</p>
    <p>Un­der this sys­tem, the politi­cian with the seat in Par­lia­ment does not look after any par­tic­u­lar con­stituency, as he rep­re­sents his vot­ers and not any one district.</p>
    <p>Is­sues like clogged drains in a district are not di­rected at the law­maker or his party, but at mu­nic­i­pal coun­cils in charge of the wards.</p>
