    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s first Covid-19 com­mu­nity case in 16 days is a Sin­ga­porean who works as a ser­vice en­gi­neer and had dinner with 12 fam­ily mem­bers at Seoul Gar­den in Tampines Mall last Satur­day, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily had oc­cu­pied three ta­bles at the restau­rant, and there was min­gling among the groups.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing to as­sess if there had been any breach of the rel­e­vant safe man­age­ment mea­sures, MOH added.</p>
    <p>The case is cur­rently un­linked, and epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions are in progress.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, all his iden­ti­fied close con­tacts, in­clud­ing his fam­ily mem­bers at the dinner, have been iso­lated and placed in quar­an­tine. They will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod so that asymp­to­matic cases will be de­tected, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The man, who de­vel­oped a fever and sore throat on Monday, works at Mas­ter Sys­tems Ma­rine. His job en­tails go­ing on board ves­sels docked at Ma­rina South Pier and West Coast Pier for ser­vic­ing and main­te­nance of ships’ nav­i­ga­tional sys­tems.</p>
    <p>He typ­i­cally worked alone, and had no in­ter­ac­tion with the ves­sel</p>
    <p>crew ex­cept for a su­per­vis­ing crew mem­ber. On days when he was not work­ing on board ves­sels, he had re­mained at his of­fice in Ver­tex Build­ing Tower B, at 33 Ubi Av­enue 3.</p>
    <p>He re­ported that he wore a sur­gi­cal mask dur­ing his work on board the ves­sels and at the of­fice, and that safe dis­tanc­ing and safe man­age­ment mea­sures were ad­hered to, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Af­ter de­vel­op­ing symp­toms, he went to a gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clinic the next day, where he was</p>
    <p>tested for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We urge ev­ery­one to con­tinue to ex­er­cise so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity, and to co­op­er­ate with the pre­vail­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“This is yet an­other re­minder that the virus has not been erad­i­cated and that new cases and clus­ters can eas­ily emerge in our com­mu­nity if we let our guard down,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said the case high</p>
    <p>lights the need to re­main vig­i­lant.</p>
    <p>“The re­al­ity is hav­ing zero cases does not mean there are no in­fec­tions out there, just that we are not find­ing these in­fec­tions,” added Prof Teo.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the Seoul Gar­den out­let in Tampines Mall, Wis­te­ria Mall was among places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, MOH said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A Jin­jja Chicken out­let in North­point City and a Mr Prata out­let in Tampines were also added to the list.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice en­gi­neer is among five new coronaviru­s cases an­nounced yes­ter­day. There were no new cases from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing four pa­tients were im­ported cases who had been placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Two are de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers who ar­rived from Pak­istan. The other two are a work per­mit holder from Malaysia, and a work pass holder who ar­rived from Nepal.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,195.</p>
