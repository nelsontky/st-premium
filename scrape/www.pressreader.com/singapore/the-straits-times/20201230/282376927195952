    <p>• Given the amount of foot­ball he has missed this sea­son, Thi­ago Al­can­tara will be like a Jan­uary sign­ing for Liver­pool but his im­mi­nent re­turn can­not come sooner for the Premier League cham­pi­ons, who are in the midst of an in­jury cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The Spain in­ter­na­tional has made only two top-flight ap­pear­ances since ar­riv­ing at An­field in Septem­ber from Bay­ern Mu­nich.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp re­vealed at his vir­tual press con­fer­ence be­fore to­day’s league game at New­cas­tle that Thi­ago was mak­ing en­cour­ag­ing progress towards full fit­ness, but will not be pressed back into first-team ac­tion un­til he has com­pleted a few more train­ing ses­sions.</p>
    <p>“On Fri­day, he trained the full ses­sion but it was a re­duced ses­sion,” he told re­porters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“He has to be part of team train­ing, it’s not about train­ing one day with the team and then you can play foot­ball i n the Premier League again. It looks quite promis­ing in the mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool, who sit three points above sec­ond-placed Le­ices­ter (29), missed an op­por­tu­nity to ex­tend their lead on Sun­day after drop­ping points at home for the first time this sea­son.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing their 1-1 draw with West Brom, Klopp warned his play­ers to be cau­tious to avoid sim­i­lar re­sults, start­ing at St James’ Park.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, they have 11 points fewer than at this stage last term.</p>
    <p>“We are not happy about it, we are ac­tu­ally the op­po­site, but now it’s over,” he said. “We can­not change that any­more, we just can make sure that in ex­actly the same sit­u­a­tion, it doesn’t hap­pen ex­actly the same again.”</p>
    <p>Aside from Thi­ago, Joel Matip, Naby Keita, Diogo Jota, Vir­gil van Dijk and Joe Gomez will all miss the trip to Ty­ne­side.</p>
    <p>New­cas­tle have their own in­jury prob­lems as well, with Ryan Fraser ruled out as well as cap­tain Ja­maal Las­celles and Al­lan Sain­tMax­imin, both of whom are out in­def­i­nitely after suf­fer­ing from the long-term ef­fects of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Tot­ten­ham host Ful­ham to­day with Spurs boss Jose Mour­inho con­firm­ing that he will be with­out Gareth Bale due to a calf in­jury that is set to keep him on the side­lines for a “few weeks”.</p>
    <p>He added yes­ter­day: “Also I have my doubts that Lu­cas (Moura) and (Car­los) Vini­cius can be fit for Ful­ham.”</p>
    <p>Op­po­site num­ber Scott Parker will, how­ever, re­turn to the Cot­tagers’ dugout after he missed their last game as he was self-iso­lat­ing fol­low­ing a fam­ily mem­ber’s pos­i­tive test for Covid-19.</p>
