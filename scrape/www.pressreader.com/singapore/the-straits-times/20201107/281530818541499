    <p>A car­pet or a rug is one of the most ver­sa­tile decor items in a home. In­te­rior de­signer Herry Tan, 27, said a car­pet helps to an­chor a space. “It makes the fur­ni­ture on it feel ‘grounded’. When com­bined with the right fur­ni­ture, it can cre­ate a com­plete look and soften the space.”</p>
    <p>There is some­thing Aladdin-es­que about the cav­ernous show­room of Has­san’s Car­pets.</p>
    <p>Step­ping into the shop is like en­ter­ing a cave dreamt up by the Mid­dle East­ern sto­ry­teller Scheheraza­de in her One Thou­sand And One Nights.</p>
    <p>There are def­i­nitely more than 1,001 car­pets in the shop in Tan Boon Liat Build­ing off Ou­tram Road. Al­though none are “magic car­pets”, the own­ers of the shop, Mr Suli­man Hamid and his daugh­ter Da­nia Has­san, say many do fly – at least fig­u­ra­tively – off the shelves.</p>
    <p>“Has­san’s Car­pets has the most ex­ten­sive col­lec­tion of Ori­en­tal car­pets from Cen­tral Asia,” claims Mr Suli­man, 72.</p>
    <p>The shop was opened in the 1930s along Or­chard Road by his late grand­fa­ther Khawaja Ab­dul Hamid, him­self a de­scen­dant of a long line of car­pet mer­chants.</p>
    <p>The an­tique and tra­di­tional car­pets at Has­san’s, says Mr Suli­man, are hand­made by ar­ti­sans us­ing clas­si­cal knot­ting tech­niques from vil­lage work­shop looms in Iran, Turkey, Afghanista­n, In­dia and coun­tries around the Cau­ca­sus Moun­tains. Car­pet-mak­ing tra­di­tions in these places date back cen­turies.</p>
    <p>“Our hand-knot­ted car­pets fea­ture flo­ral and geo­met­ric tribal de­signs, and are made us­ing silk or wool which have been coloured only with vegetable dyes,” he adds, re­fer­ring to the time-hon­oured prac­tice of dye­ing silk and wool threads with nat­u­ral pig­ments found in saf­fron from the cro­cus flower, berries and wal­nut husks.</p>
    <p>The shop has, in the last five years, ex­panded its hand-knot­ted car­pet col­lec­tion to in­clude con­tem­po­rary and ab­stract de­signs to cater to a younger clien­tele.</p>
    <p>Ms Da­nia says: “Our tra­di­tional best­sellers are the clas­sic florals and no­madic tribal pieces. But in the last five years, we have also been sell­ing con­tem­po­rary pieces as home own­ers like a mix of styles in dif­fer­ent parts of their homes.”</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old says the ra­tio of de­mand for Has­san’s clas­sic to con­tem­po­rary car­pets is 50:50.</p>
    <p>An an­tique Per­sian car­pet from the Ira­nian city of Is­fa­han from the 1920s can cost around $10,000, while a tra­di­tional-style Per­sian piece from the vil­lage of Shah­sa­van made around two years ago can cost about $1,500.</p>
    <p>“Tra­di­tional car­pets such as Per­sians and Turko­mans have a spe­cial pres­ence which not only matches most in­te­ri­ors, but also forms a fo­cal point in in­te­rior spa­ces,” she says.</p>
    <p>This view is echoed by in­te­rior de­signer Herry Tan, 27, of Paren­the­sis Stu­dio, a home-grown firm spe­cial­is­ing in res­i­den­tial and com­mer­cial projects.</p>
    <p>“A car­pet helps to an­chor a space,” he says. “It softly de­mar­cates ar­eas with­out cre­at­ing vis­ual dis­trac­tions or block­ing views. It makes the fur­ni­ture on it feel ‘grounded’. When com­bined with the right fur­ni­ture, it can cre­ate a com­plete look and soften the space.”</p>
    <p>While stun­ning, hand­wo­ven and ar­ti­sanal car­pets, be­sides cost­ing a pretty penny, also re­quire main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>Has­san’s runs a car­pet clinic which cleans car­pets, re­pairs torn or dam­aged ones and re­ju­ve­nates old weather-worn tas­sels and fringes. Car­pet-clean­ing prices largely de­pend on whether it is an an­tique car­pet or a con­tem­po­rary rug and gen­er­ally start at $4 a square foot for a thor­ough wash, in­clud­ing pickup and de­liv­ery.</p>
    <p>Ms Da­nia says the car­pets are thor­oughly cleaned us­ing a hy­poal­ler­genic dust­ing ma­chine to “beat” the dust and mi­cro-de­bris out of the fab­ric. This process re­vives the colours with­out the use of harsh clean­ing chem­i­cals. The car­pet is then brushed with soapy wa­ter and dried in the sun.</p>
    <p>There are, of course, more af­ford­able car­pets which are also eas­ier to care for. These come in a range of syn­thetic fi­bres which are ei­ther low pile or flat; or high pile with</p>
    <p>more vol­ume, and which can be cleaned with a vac­uum cleaner.</p>
    <p>They are avail­able from re­tail­ers in­clud­ing IT and fur­ni­ture chain Har­vey Nor­man or car­pet spe­cial­ists such as Finn Av­enue. Prices range from about $400 to $3,000.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some home own­ers pre­fer to avoid car­pets al­to­gether. These pieces, they say, are dust traps and dif­fi­cult to keep clean with young chil­dren in the home.</p>
    <p>But Ms Visha Nel­son, the Sin­ga­pore-born founder of The Cin­na­mon Room, hopes to change their minds with her range of con­tem­po­rary car­pets.</p>
    <p>Dis­played in her Hol­land Vil­lage show­room are con­tem­po­rary rugs, hand­made us­ing high-grade, eth­i­cally sourced ox or cow hide. Durable and easy to main­tain, they fea­ture vi­brant hues, bold geo­met­rics and metal­lic ac­cents.</p>
    <p>“This aver­sion to car­pets from peo­ple I spoke to over the years made me ven­ture into de­sign­ing rugs us­ing eth­i­cally sourced hides as they are a low-pile ma­te­rial that is su­per-easy to clean. Even stains from red wine can be eas­ily wiped off,” says the for­mer cap­i­tal mar­kets lawyer, who has two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The 49-year-old, who worked in Lon­don, Hong Kong and New York be­fore re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore six years ago, adds: “I re­alised there was a real gap in the mar­ket in Sin­ga­pore for af­ford­able home decor, es­pe­cially good qual­ity car­pets, when I was try­ing to fur­nish my home. From there, the busi­ness was born in 2014.”</p>
    <p>She re­ceived the Gold Award for Best Car­pet and Rug Store i n Sin­ga­pore for the past two years in life­style guide Ex­pat Liv­ing’s Read­ers’ Choice Awards.</p>
    <p>Among her best­sellers are hide rugs that have metal­lic and laseretche­d de­signs, and which re­tail from $1,050 to about $2,950.</p>
    <p>Ms Lor­raine Lee re­cently bought a black, grey and white geo­met­ric hide rug from The Cin­na­mon Room, which added tex­ture and con­trast to the neu­tral colours of her apart­ment near Kep­pel Bay.</p>
    <p>“I fell in love with it and picked my sofa with the rug in mind,” says Ms Lee, 50, a gen­eral coun­sel and chief pri­vacy of­fi­cer at a multi­na­tional firm based in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Our liv­ing room opens out to a sea view and is bright and breezy. The sub­tle metal­lic fea­ture catches the sun­light and shim­mers like the sea out­side. It re­ally gives the liv­ing area a chic feel and works well to de­fine the space.”</p>
    <p>It softly de­mar­cates ar­eas with­out cre­at­ing vis­ual dis­trac­tions or block­ing views... When com­bined with the right fur­ni­ture, it can cre­ate a com­plete look and soften the space.</p>
