    <p>Un­til such time that the electric charg­ing net­work here can reach its full po­ten­tial, the Nissan Kicks rep­re­sents the best parts of in­ter­nal com­bus­tion and electric driv­e­trains – the im­me­di­acy of drive with­out the anx­i­ety of range. It might not be the quick­est on the road, but it is among the most fru­gal and stylish.</p>
    <p>WONG KAI YI, a judge on the panel for The Straits Times’ Car of the Year</p>
    <p>The Nissan Kicks, a com­pact hy­brid cross­over, is the clear favourite among Straits Times read­ers.</p>
    <p>In a fun poll which pre­cedes the an­nual Straits Times Car of the Year (ST COTY) an­nounce­ment, the Kicks gar­nered 30 per cent of to­tal votes cast.</p>
    <p>This is well ahead of 19 per cent for run­ner-up Mazda CX-30 and 17 per cent for the Porsche Taycan.</p>
    <p>Hyundai’s Avante saloon landed 14 per cent of votes, while the re­main­ing four nom­i­nees this year each won be­tween 3 and 7 per cent of votes.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, 8,702 votes were cast, down dras­ti­cally from 28,249 last year. This could have been be­cause the Covid-19 pan­demic, with its dev­as­tat­ing im­pact on the econ­omy and jobs, had damp­ened in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>As be­fore, re­sults of the read­ers’ poll do not have a bear­ing on the ST Car of the Year, which is se­lected via a strin­gent multi-step process in­volv­ing pro­pos­als, ar­gu­ments and a scor­ing sys­tem which weighs nine traits of each nom­i­nee against its peers.</p>
    <p>In­stead, the read­ers’ poll is a way for ST Mo­tor­ing to en­gage with its read­ers and industry play­ers.</p>
    <p>This year’s favourite is a novel petrol-electric hy­brid.</p>
    <p>The Kicks is pow­ered by an electric mo­tor. The bat­tery, which sup­plies the elec­tri­cal power, is charged by an on-board 1.2-litre en­gine which acts solely as a gen­er­a­tor. This is un­like other hy­brids, which are pow­ered by a com­bus­tion en­gine as­sisted by an electric mo­tor, or which al­ter­nate be­tween en­gine, mo­tor and a com­bi­na­tion of the two.</p>
    <p>Dr Kong Yongyao, who is on the ST COTY judg­ing panel, says the Kicks is a vi­able op­tion for those who want to have a go at elec­tri­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“If you don’t have your own pri­vate charg­ing point, the idea of own­ing electric cars is a non­starter,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Yet, an electric pow­er­train, es­pe­cially in the city and at stand­still to mid­dling speeds, is ob­jec­tively bet­ter in every way than its petrol coun­ter­part.”</p>
    <p>Its only draw­back is that “it doesn’t do as many kilo­me­tres on a litre as a Toy­ota Prius”.</p>
