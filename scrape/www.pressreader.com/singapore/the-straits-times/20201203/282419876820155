    <p>•</p>
    <p>An­field was empty, his Liver­pool team de­pleted by in­jury and it was hardly a vin­tage per­for­mance but the 1-0 win over Ajax Am­s­ter­dam on Tues­day still left man­ager Jur­gen Klopp burst­ing with pride.</p>
    <p>“Hon­estly since I was at Liver­pool that feels like one of the big­gest Cham­pi­ons League nights. With­out sup­port­ers in, it was the most im­por­tant, most dif­fi­cult, most ex­cep­tional,” said the Ger­man af­ter his side se­cured top spot in Group D with a game to spare.</p>
    <p>“With the cir­cum­stances, there hasn’t been much to smile about, it’s been tricky, and the boys throw them­selves into the game.</p>
    <p>“Robbo (Andy Robert­son) has a proper knock on the an­kle and pushes him­self through, Hendo (Jor­dan Hen­der­son) with a sore back, Gini (Wi­j­nal­dum) – I have no words for him.</p>
    <p>“Cur­tis Jones, what a game, I’m re­ally proud.”</p>
    <p>Jones, 19, got the sec­ond-half win­ner and was one of the bright­est play­ers in mid­field.</p>
    <p>Klopp had another in­jury to con­tend with be­fore the game, with goal­keeper Alis­son Becker ruled out with a ham­string strain. Re­serve Ir­ish goal­keeper Caoimhin Kelle­her was picked ahead of the more ex­pe­ri­enced Adrian.</p>
    <p>Kelle­her, 22, re­sponded with a vi­tal save in the clos­ing mo­ments of the match to se­cure three points.</p>
    <p>“That’s what I’m there for, I work ev­ery day in train­ing to make sure I am ready and I was able to make a good few saves,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It was an amaz­ing one for me, to make my Cham­pi­ons League de­but. It was mas­sive and we got the win and qual­i­fied. A great night.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool were al­ready with­out Vir­gil van Dijk, Joe Gomez, Alex Oxlade-Cham­ber­lain, Naby Keita, Xher­dan Shaqiri, Trent Alexan­der-Arnold and James Milner through in­jury and Klopp was pleased that Jones took his chance.</p>
    <p>“That’s how it is some­times, in sit­u­a­tions where there are prob­lems there is al­ways an op­por­tu­nity for some­one else and he took it just ex­cep­tion­ally well,” he said. “Cur­tis is a re­ally good player and I am happy to have him around.”</p>
    <p>Ajax now must beat Ata­lanta next week to make the last 16.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Porto also qual­i­fied for the last 16 while Manch­ester City sealed first place in Group C af­ter a 0-0 draw at the Es­ta­dio do Dra­gao.</p>
    <p>Pep Guardi­ola’s side sur­ren­dered their 100 per cent record in the Cham­pi­ons League this sea­son but the City boss still praised his play­ers for their dis­play.</p>
    <p>“In all the games away we have played a re­ally high level. In gen­eral, I am more than de­lighted with the per­for­mance in these games,” he said.</p>
