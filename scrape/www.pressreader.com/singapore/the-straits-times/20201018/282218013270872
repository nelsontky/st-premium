    <p>LON­DON • Jur­gen Klopp was left fum­ing at the VAR (video as­sis­tant ref­eree) af­ter his Liver­pool side were held to a 2-2 Premier League derby draw with Ever­ton at Good­i­son Park yes­ter­day, as a late ef­fort from Jor­dan Henderson was ruled out by the tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The game was locked at two goals apiece af­ter Do­minic CalvertLew­in’s 10th goal of the sea­son in all com­pe­ti­tions had brought Ever­ton level in the 81st minute.</p>
    <p>But, in stop­page time, Thi­ago Al­can­tara found Sa­dio Mane with a clever pass and the Sene­galese’s low cross was turned in by Henderson, only for VAR to find the nar­row­est of off­sides by Mane.</p>
    <p>“I’ve seen the dis­al­lowed goal at the end and in the pic­ture I saw it wasn’t off­side. Can some­one ex­plain that to me?” Klopp said.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know where the line is where you can do off­side. I’m a big sup­porter of VAR but you ex­pect them to make the right de­ci­sions. I’ve done 10 in­ter­views and ev­ery­one has told me it’s not off­side. That doesn’t lift my mood.”</p>
    <p>Ever­ton re­mained top of the ta­ble on 13 points, three ahead of Liver­pool, af­ter an in­ci­dent-packed end to the 237th Mersey­side Derby.</p>
    <p>To add to the Reds’ dis­ap­point­ment, they suf­fered an in­jury to key de­fender Vir­gil van Dijk which forced the Dutch­man out of the game in the 11th minute.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool were hu­mil­i­ated 7-2 by As­ton Villa just be­fore the in­ter­na­tional break but they quickly set about putting things right when Mane scored in the third minute, fir­ing home a low cross from Andy Robert­son.</p>
    <p>The Premier League cham­pi­ons suf­fered a blow eight min­utes later when van Dijk went down with a knee in­jury and had to be sub­sti­tuted af­ter a reck­less chal­lenge from Ever­ton goal­keeper Jor­dan Pick­ford.</p>
    <p>There was no foul called as the Reds’ lead-up play to the in­ci­dent was called out for off­side.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton took ad­van­tage of the Dutch­man’s ab­sence when, from a cor­ner, Michael Keane rose at the near post to power a header past Adrian.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool were on top for long stretches and Mo­hamed Salah re­stored their l ead i n the 72nd minute, pounc­ing on a headed clear­ance by Yerry Mina and drilling past Pick­ford for his 100th goal for the club.</p>
    <p>But Ever­ton, de­ter­mined not to lose their un­beaten record, got back on level terms when James Ro­driguez sent Lu­cas Digne down the left and his per­fectly floated cross was headed home by the leap­ing Calvert-Lewin.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton’s Brazil­ian for­ward Richarli­son was sent off in the 90th minute af­ter a wild chal­lenge on Thi­ago. Then came the VAR drama that left Klopp be­mused.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man, how­ever, was pleased with his side’s dis­play.</p>
    <p>He said: “The per­for­mance was top, it was a top game and a good game for both teams. We were dom­i­nant against a side full of con­fi­dence and with a clear plan.</p>
    <p>“It was prob­a­bly the best away game since I was at Liver­pool. I saw a re­ally good per­for­mance. I would be more happy if we win.</p>
    <p>“We played a re­ally good game, we were su­pe­rior and dom­i­nated it but we only get one point.”</p>
    <p>Ever­ton man­ager Carlo Ancelotti felt that the match could have gone ei­ther way fol­low­ing the late drama.</p>
    <p>“We could have won or lost,” he said. “The per­for­mance was good, we wanted to com­pete with Liver­pool and we did with good spirit.</p>
    <p>“We never lost con­fi­dence and we had op­por­tu­ni­ties. At the end, the per­for­mance was sat­is­fac­tory.”</p>
    <p>NOT HAPPY</p>
    <p>I’m a big sup­porter of VAR but you ex­pect them to make the right de­ci­sions. I’ve done 10 in­ter­views and ev­ery­one has told me it’s not off­side. That doesn’t lift my mood.</p>

    <p>NOT UN­HAPPY</p>
    <p>We could have won or lost. The per­for­mance was good, we wanted to com­pete with Liver­pool and we did with good spirit. We never lost con­fi­dence and we had op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
