    <p>JAKARTA • Hun­dreds of work­ers rid­ing mo­tor­bikes and wav­ing flags held a rally in the In­done­sian cap­i­tal Jakarta yes­ter­day, as protests call­ing on Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo to re­peal a con­tro­ver­sial new job law en­tered a sec­ond week.</p>
    <p>De­signed to boost in­vest­ment and cut red tape, the so-called “om­nibus” law has sparked wide­spread out­cry across In­done­sia, with pro­test­ers say­ing the leg­is­la­tion un­der­mines labour rights and weak­ens en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tions.</p>
    <p>Demon­stra­tions erupted in in­dus­trial ar­eas and cities across the ar­chi­pel­ago last week af­ter the Bill was passed; there were chaotic scenes in some ar­eas, pub­lic prop­erty was torched and al­most 6,000 peo­ple ar­rested.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, a union of­fi­cial es­ti­mated that 1,000 work­ers had gath­ered in cen­tral Jakarta to hold an­other protest against the law.</p>
    <p>“We want the om­nibus law to be re­voked, and the gov­ern­ment to is­sue a pres­i­den­tial de­cree to re­place it,” Ms Ema Liliefna from the Con­fed­er­a­tion of All In­done­sia Trade Unions told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko has de­fended the law, say­ing demon­stra­tors were mo­ti­vated by “dis­in­for­ma­tion” and urg­ing crit­ics to chal­lenge the law in the courts in­stead.</p>
    <p>The new law, which re­vises more than 70 ex­ist­ing laws and reg­u­la­tions, has been met with cautious op­ti­mism from mar­kets and the busi­ness com­mu­nity, but crit­ics say the changes were rushed through and un­der­mine ex­ist­ing labour laws, in­clud­ing on sev­er­ance pay and work hours.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers held ral­lies in other ma­jor In­done­sian cities yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing in Bandung and Medan, ac­cord­ing to me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>De­spite the Pres­i­dent’s as­sur­ances that the law is needed to help cre­ate jobs as South-east Asia’s pan­demic-hit econ­omy veers to­wards a re­ces­sion, sev­eral groups – in­clud­ing In­done­sia’s largest Is­lamic as­so­ci­a­tion, Nahd­latul Ulama – have pledged to lodge a ju­di­cial re­view.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, an al­liance of con­ser­va­tive Is­lamic or­gan­i­sa­tions, in­clud­ing the Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front and Alumni 212 move­ment, is plan­ning to protest against the law out­side the state palace to­day, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment.</p>
