    <p>More than $1 mil­lion was raised at Dover Park Hospice’s first vir­tual char­ity din­ner last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>About 250 guests at­tended the on­line fund-raiser, themed Sweet Sum­mer Nights, which took guests on a trip to a trop­i­cal is­land from the com­fort of their own homes.</p>
    <p>The money raised will go to­wards pro­vid­ing holis­tic pal­lia­tive care for pa­tients and sup­port­ing their care­givers, said the hospice.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, the guest of hon­our at the event, said in his speech that, given the eco­nomic down­turn, many char­i­ties are find­ing it harder to raise funds.</p>
    <p>“In such try­ing times, I ap­plaud the team at Dover Park Hospice for your ded­i­ca­tion and hard work in car­ing for your pa­tients,” said Mr Heng, who is also the Fi­nance Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“I read your most re­cent an­nual report, and was in­spired by one line, ‘Ev­ery mo­ment mat­ters, even in the time of Covid-19’. In­deed, you must con­tinue to in­no­vate and pro­vide the best care to your pa­tients de­spite the cir­cum­stances.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said that great strides have been made in pal­lia­tive care since the hospice move­ment in Sin­ga­pore started in the 1980s, but more can still be done to raise aware­ness of it.</p>
    <p>He added that he was glad to learn that the hospice has ex­panded its ser­vices, such as with the open­ing of its day care fa­cil­ity in Oc­to­ber last year, and the re­cent ex­pan­sion of home care ser­vices that also serves non-can­cer pa­tients with end-stage or­gan fail­ure.</p>
    <p>Dover Park Hospice chair­man Jeremy Lim said: “Though th­ese are cer­tainly very chal­leng­ing times, we re­main stead­fast in pro­vid­ing the best care for our pa­tients and care­givers in the new nor­mal. We will have to be more in­no­va­tive and trans­form the way we op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>“We are ex­cited about our move to our new fa­cil­ity at the In­te­grated Care Hub in 2022, as we ramp up our re­sources and in­fra­struc­ture to serve twice as many pa­tients.”</p>
    <p>The In­te­grated Care Hub, to be man­aged by Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal, will be a 500-bed community fa­cil­ity that will of­fer a full range of re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion fa­cil­i­ties and pal­lia­tive care ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Part of the funds raised from last Fri­day’s din­ner will go to­wards the hospice’s new fa­cil­ity at the hub.</p>
    <p>Guests at the vir­tual din­ner en­joyed live-streamed per­for­mances from ra­dio dee­jay Denise Tan, who per­formed a skit and hosted the event, as well as a med­ley of Abba hits by the hospice’s show choir, made up of vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>A cu­rated din­ner from award-win</p>
    <p>ning food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ments, such as Odette and Alma by Juan Amador, was de­liv­ered to the guests’ homes.</p>
    <p>Guests also took part in a silent auc­tion and a raf­fle draw.</p>
