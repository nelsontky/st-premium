    <p>WASH­ING­TON • In the first TV in­ter­view since los­ing his re-elec­tion bid, Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in­di­cated that he will never con­cede to Mr Joe Bi­den and never aban­don his con­spir­acy the­ory about mass bal­lot fraud.</p>
    <p>“It’s not like you’re gonna change my mind. My mind will not change in six months,” Mr</p>
    <p>Trump told Fox News in­ter­viewer Maria Bar­tiromo on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“This elec­tion was rigged. This elec­tion was a to­tal fraud,” he claimed, again with­out back­ing up his al­le­ga­tions. “We won the elec­tion eas­ily.”</p>
    <p>The 45-minute in­ter­view, Mr Trump’s first on tele­vi­sion since the Nov 3 elec­tion, was mostly a mono­logue of ev­i­dence-free claims con­cern­ing elec­tion fraud, which went vir­tu­ally un­chal­lenged by Ms Bar­tiromo.</p>
    <p>De­spite Mr Trump’s un­prece­dented at­tack on the va­lid­ity of the US elec­tion sys­tem, his le­gal team has yet to pro­vide any ev­i­dence that stands up in court.</p>
    <p>Case af­ter case has been re­jected by judges around the coun­try. The lat­est re­buff came from the Penn­syl­va­nia Supreme Court, which last Satur­day turned down a law­suit filed by Mr Trump’s sup­port­ers seek­ing to con­test Mr Bi­den’s win in the state.</p>
    <p>“We’re try­ing to put the ev­i­dence in and the judges won’t al­low us to do it,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>“We are try­ing. We have so much ev­i­dence.”</p>
    <p>Ig­nor­ing the usual bound­aries be­tween his of­fice and the ju­di­cial and law en­force­ment sys­tem, Mr Trump com­plained that the Depart­ment of Jus­tice and the Fed­eral Bu­reau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion were not help­ing him. They are “miss­ing in ac­tion”, he said, also ques­tion­ing the point of the Supreme Court if it does not in­ter­vene.</p>
    <p>“We should be heard by the Supreme Court. Some­thing has to be able to get up there. Oth­er­wise, what is the Supreme Court?” Mr Trump asked.</p>
    <p>The 2020 elec­tion was not es­pe­cially close. Mr Bi­den won the elec­toral col­lege vote – the state-bystate com­pe­ti­tion de­cid­ing the win­ner – by 306 to 232. In the pop­u­lar na­tional vote, which does not de­cide the re­sult, but still has political and sym­bolic heft, Mr Bi­den won by 51 to 47 per cent.</p>
    <p>Losers of US pres­i­den­tial elec­tions tra­di­tion­ally con­cede al­most im­me­di­ately. But whether or not Mr Trump ever ac­knowl­edges de­feat, the elec­toral col­lege is all but cer­tain to go through the for­mal mo­tions of con­firm­ing Mr Bi­den when it meets on Dec 14, and the Demo­crat will be sworn into of­fice on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>Even as the clock runs down on his sin­gle term, Mr Trump de­clined to say on Fox News whether he sees an ex­piry date for his un­suc­cess­ful le­gal cam­paign.</p>
    <p>“I’m not go­ing to say a date,” he said. Asked if he saw a path to vic­tory, he said: “I hope so.”</p>
