    <p>Con­cerns over a new, more vir­u­lent strain of the coro­n­avirus prompted Bri­tain to im­pose stricter lock­down rules yes­ter­day, while doc­tors in Hong Kong and South Africa warned that new vari­ants were caus­ing more se­vere symp­toms in those in­fected.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal ex­perts also noted that the new strains could spread more rapidly and made even younger peo­ple more sus­cep­ti­ble to fall­ing se­ri­ously ill.</p>
    <p>Eng­land’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Chris Whitty said that while there was no cur­rent ev­i­dence the new vari­ant in Bri­tain caused a higher mor­tal­ity rate or im­pacted vac­cines, ur­gent work was un­der way to con­firm this.</p>
    <p>Much of Bri­tain is al­ready un­der the high­est tier of re­stric­tions that have shut bars and restau­rants.</p>
    <p>How­ever, plans to ease th­ese con­trols for five days over the Christ­mas hol­i­days to al­low three sep­a­rate house­holds to meet in­doors were se­verely cur­tailed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult of the rapid spread of the new vari­ant, pre­lim­i­nary mod­el­ling data and rapidly ris­ing in­ci­dence rates in the South East, (an ex­pert body ad­vis­ing the gov­ern­ment) now con­sid­ers that the new strain can spread more quickly... We have alerted the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and are con­tin­u­ing to an­a­lyse the avail­able data to im­prove our un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>ENG­LAND’S CHIEF MED­I­CAL OF­FI­CER CHRIS WHITTY</p>
    <p>LONDON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son im­posed a tighter set of coro­n­avirus con­trols on millions of peo­ple in Eng­land yes­ter­day, telling them to stay home, and dras­ti­cally scaled back plans to ease re­stric­tions over Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>With the aver­age num­ber of cases in Eng­land soar­ing be­cause of a new, more con­ta­gious strain of the virus, Mr John­son said the gov­ern­ment had to take ur­gent ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“I know how much emo­tion peo­ple in­vest in this time of year... I know how dis­ap­point­ing this will be,” Mr John­son told a news con­fer­ence. “There is no al­ter­na­tive open to me.”</p>
    <p>London and south-east Eng­land – with about a third of the English pop­u­la­tion – are cur­rently in the high­est level of a three-tier sys­tem of rules, and will now be placed in a new “Tier 4” level.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple will be re­quired to stay at home ex­cept for es­sen­tial rea­sons such as work, and non-es­sen­tial re­tail will close, as will in­door leisure and en­ter­tain­ment. Social mix­ing will be lim­ited to meet­ing one other per­son in an out­door space.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son had said on Fri­day he hoped Eng­land would not need a third lock­down af­ter Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>He had also re­sisted calls to change plans to ease re­stric­tions for five days over the fes­tive pe­riod and al­low three sep­a­rate house­holds to meet in­doors.</p>
    <p>How­ever, those now in Tier 4 will not be al­lowed to mix with oth­ers over Christ­mas. And all oth­ers will now be al­lowed to see friends and fam­ily for only one day.</p>
    <p>The new rules came into ef­fect at mid­night yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Eng­land’s chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Chris Whitty con­firmed yes­ter­day that the new virus strain, which sur­faced in the coun­try, could spread faster. He called for greater public vig­i­lance to re­duce the trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“As a re­sult of the rapid spread of the new vari­ant, pre­lim­i­nary mod­el­ling data and rapidly ris­ing in­ci­dence rates in the South East, (an ex­pert body ad­vis­ing the gov­ern­ment) now con­sid­ers that the new strain can spread more quickly,” he said.</p>
    <p>He noted that while there was no cur­rent ev­i­dence show­ing the vari­ant caused a higher mor­tal­ity rate or im­pacted vac­cines, ur­gent work was un­der way to con­firm this.</p>
    <p>“We have alerted the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and are con­tin­u­ing to an­a­lyse the avail­able data to im­prove our un­der­stand­ing,” Dr Whitty said.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain re­ported 27,052 new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day and 534 deaths. The re­pro­duc­tion “R” num­ber is es­ti­mated to be be­tween 1.1 and 1.2, mean­ing the num­ber of cases is rapidly in­creas­ing.</p>
    <p>“Fail­ing to act de­ci­sively now will mean fur­ther suf­fer­ing,” Dr Jeremy Far­rar, di­rec­tor of the Well­come Trust and a mem­ber of the gov­ern­ment’s Sci­en­tific Ad­vi­sory Group for Emer­gen­cies, said on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“We must keep ask­ing our­selves ‘are we do­ing enough, are we act­ing quickly enough’.”</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion Labour Party said the tier sys­tem had failed to curb the virus’ spread. “It has been ap­par­ent for some days that the virus is again out of con­trol in parts of the coun­try,” said Mr Jonathan Ash­worth, Labour’s health spokesman.</p>
