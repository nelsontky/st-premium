    <p>Stay­ing home with cir­cuit breaker mea­sures in place has nudged us into ex­pe­ri­enc­ing dif­fer­ent pieces of re­al­ity, such as vis­it­ing the mu­seum, vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>In the same vein, re­al­tors have been ex­plor­ing vir­tual plat­forms to mar­ket prop­er­ties they rep­re­sent, since large-scale prop­erty launch events and showflat view­ings have been sus­pended till fur­ther no­tice.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer and founder of vir­tual tour builder plat­form Panope­dia, Mr Randy Png, shared that his web­site re­ceived a three­fold in­crease in new user reg­is­tra­tions in April and May this year, from Fe­bru­ary and March.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ence has also been digi­tised fur­ther. Trans­ac­tions have been adapted ac­cord­ingly for book­ing fees to be made, and con­tracts to be signed with­out buy­ers and agents meet­ing in per­son.</p>
    <p>Elec­tronic pay­ments such as Fast and Se­cure Trans­fer, MAS Elec­tronic Pay­ment Sys­tem and</p>
    <p>Gen­eral In­ter­bank Re­cur­ring Or­der were au­tho­rised, in ad­di­tion to the ex­ist­ing modes of cheques, cashier’s or­ders or tele­graphic trans­fers. And where wet ink sig­na­tures were still re­quired for le­gal pur­poses, couri­ers had to be used.</p>
    <p>What tech­nol­ogy can’t re­place</p>
    <p>But while vir­tual show­rooms are a good stop­gap mea­sure for now, phys­i­cal vis­its to showflats re­main the best way to see if such a big-ticket item as a new home meets your needs on ev­ery level.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy can­not repli­cate the feel­ing of step­ping into a showflat for a sense of its space and sur­round­ings, or mimic the firm hand­shake ex­changed with your prop­erty agent af­ter the Op­tion to Pur­chase pa­per­work is inked.</p>
    <p>How­ever, tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ments could pave the way for more per­son­alised ex­pe­ri­ences in the near fu­ture. “Vir­tual tours might soon be able to have a 3D-mod­eled ‘sales­per­son’, who would be able to guide view­ers through var­i­ous as­pects of the showflat, and maybe even in­ter­act with the viewer through chat,” says Mr Png.</p>
