    <p>• Ar­se­nal are off to their worst start to an English top-flight sea­son in 39 years af­ter slump­ing to their fifth Premier League de­feat of the cam­paign, scor­ing just 10 goals.</p>
    <p>But de­spite fall­ing to 14th in the stand­ings on Sun­day, man­ager Mikel Arteta in­sisted he was not wor­ried about los­ing his job.</p>
    <p>Strikes by Pe­dro Neto and Daniel Po­dence ei­ther side of Gabriel’s equaliser gave Wolves a 2-1 win at the Emi­rates, a re­sult that left Ar­se­nal on 13 points, eight be­hind lead­ers Tot­ten­ham, who they face in the north Lon­don derby on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Arteta’s pre­de­ces­sor and Span­ish com­pa­triot Unai Emery was sacked a year to the day on Sun­day when the club were sit­ting eighth, but he claimed he was fo­cused on the team’s fu­ture, not his own.</p>
    <p>“It’s some­thing that the day I de­cided to be a coach, I knew that one day, I would be sacked or leave the foot­ball club but I don’t know when that is go­ing to hap­pen,” he told re­porters.</p>
    <p>“In this pro­fes­sion, I know it will hap­pen but I never worry about it. My only con­cern is to get the best out of the play­ers and give the best pos­si­ble ser­vice to the club.”</p>
    <p>Ar­se­nal have lost their last three home league games and only two of their 13 shots were on tar­get on Sun­day, prompt­ing Arteta to ad­mit that “the moun­tain is a big one to climb”.</p>
    <p>To com­pound mat­ters, he con­firmed £45 mil­lion (S$80.4 mil­lion) dead­line-day sign­ing Thomas Partey, who has missed the past three games af­ter be­ing taken off with an in­jury against As­ton Villa, is likely to be ab­sent for the whole of this month, in­clud­ing the hec­tic Christ­mas sched­ule.</p>
    <p>On the mid­fielder, he said: “I don’t think he will be with us in the next few games but still, we’ve been miss­ing a lot of play­ers.”</p>
    <p>Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang is also en­dur­ing the worst drought of his Ar­se­nal ca­reer and his worst run of form in six years. He has just two goals this term, one a penalty, and had just one shot on Sun­day, lead­ing Arteta to ex­press con­cerns over his drop in form.</p>
    <p>“I think we all are (wor­ried) be­cause the main goalscorer of the club at the mo­ment isn’t scor­ing goals, so my big­gest con­cern is how to help him more to score goals be­cause we need his goals,” he said. “He needs to be scor­ing goals if we want to be suc­cess­ful.”</p>
    <p>Wolves, on the other hand, are go­ing from strength to strength, climb­ing to sixth and within four points of joint-league lead­ers Tot­ten­ham and Liverpool be­fore yes­ter­day’s fix­tures.</p>
    <p>The away win – their first at Ar­se­nal since 1979 – was only tainted by a sick­en­ing clash of heads in the first half be­tween Raul Jimenez and David Luiz, which left the lat­ter blood­ied and the for­mer stretchere­d off.</p>
    <p>Wolves said that Mex­ico for­ward Jimenez frac­tured his skull and was “com­fort­able” fol­low­ing surgery af­ter the game.</p>
    <p>Man­ager Nuno Espir­ito Santo said he was proud of his team for putting the in­ci­dent be­hind them, adding: “We were amaz­ing af­ter that, but es­pe­cially to­day be­cause this team showed heart.</p>
    <p>“A real be­lief in the way they ran and worked be­cause of what hap­pened. We want to grow, we want to im­prove and we want to have so­lu­tions.”</p>
