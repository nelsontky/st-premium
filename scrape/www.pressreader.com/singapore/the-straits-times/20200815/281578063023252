    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat will de­liver a min­is­te­rial state­ment on Mon­day at 3.30pm on how the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to sup­port work­ers and busi­nesses, with sup­port schemes set to ex­pire while the Covid-19 pan­demic drags on.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat will set forth, in a min­is­te­rial state­ment on Mon­day, how the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to sup­port work­ers and busi­nesses even as aid schemes are due to ex­pire while the Covid-19 pan­demic drags on.</p>
    <p>He will de­liver the state­ment at 3.30pm via a broad­cast car­ried on The Straits Times web­site, CNA, CNA938 and Me­di­a­corp MeWatch.</p>
    <p>While he as­sured Sin­ga­pore­ans that the Gov­ern­ment would con­tinue to shore up work­ers and firms, it could not sus­tain the same level of sup­port in­def­i­nitely, Mr Heng, who is also the Fi­nance Min­is­ter, wrote in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“As more sec­tors re­open grad­u­ally, we will have to evolve and ta­per the sup­port pro­vided,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to pro­vide tar­geted sup­port to sec­tors that are hard­est hit, in­clud­ing help­ing them pivot to new op­por­tu­ni­ties in growth ar­eas.”</p>
    <p>He said many peo­ple had shared with him, in the past few weeks, their anx­i­eties and con­cerns about their liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>“Weigh­ing on their minds was also the un­cer­tainty ahead, given that some of the sup­port schemes are ex­pir­ing. I will be pro­vid­ing more details on how we will evolve and ex­tend our sup­port for our com­pa­nies and our work­ers in my min­is­te­rial state­ment on Mon­day,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures an­nounced dur­ing the four Bud­gets ear­lier this year in­clude the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) of wage sub­si­dies, cash trans­fers for house­holds, rental and for­eign worker levy waivers and fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance for the self-em­ployed, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore faces a deep­en­ing re­ces­sion be­cause of the pan­demic. Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) shrank by 6.7 per cent in the first half of the year, with the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try now pre­dict­ing GDP will de­cline by 5 per cent to 7 per cent this year, com­pared with the pre­vi­ous range fore­cast of mi­nus 4 per cent to mi­nus 7 per cent.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond quar­ter, the econ­omy con­tracted by 13.2 per cent year on year, sharper than the 12.6 per cent plunge ear­lier es­ti­mated and the worst on record.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, Mr Heng said he has had in­ten­sive dis­cus­sions with gov­ern­ment agen­cies to re­view and ad­just gov­ern­ment sup­port schemes. Some are set to ta­per off be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>In the For­ti­tude Bud­get an­nounced in May – the fourth round of Covid-19 gov­ern­ment aid so far – wage sub­si­dies for lo­cal em­ploy­ees un­der the en­hanced JSS were ex­tended to cover salaries this month.</p>
    <p>In­tro­duced in the first Bud­get sup­port pack­age in Fe­bru­ary, the JSS sub­sidised up to 75 per cent of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages for each lo­cal worker, with sec­tors more badly hit by the pan­demic, such as the avi­a­tion and tourism sec­tors, re­ceiv­ing more sup­port.</p>
    <p>Other mea­sures that will end soon in­clude the for­eign worker levy waivers and the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate post yes­ter­day, Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said some busi­nesses are in sur­vival mode and fo­cused on mak­ing it through the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“Such sen­ti­ments are com­pletely un­der­stand­able. It is not easy for en­trepreneur­s to give up the busi­nesses they have built from scratch and de­voted so much re­sources to,” said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>He said it was im­por­tant to cre­ate a con­ducive en­vi­ron­ment for firms to flour­ish, which would in­clude giv­ing them the abil­ity to travel, de­velop a strong lo­cal work­force and ac­cess tal­ent.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses are re­al­is­tic about the fact that Covid-19 fi­nan­cial sup­port mea­sures have to come to an end, but they are still hop­ing some key help will con­tinue in the short term.</p>
    <p>Mr Sim Gim Guan, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Sin­ga­pore National Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion, wants to see the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS), which pro­vides wage sub­si­dies for lo­cal em­ploy­ees, ex­tended be­yond this month.</p>
    <p>“The Gov­ern­ment should ta­per off the JSS grad­u­ally in tan­dem with the likely slow re­cov­ery of the econ­omy, while pro­vid­ing tar­geted sup­port for se­verely af­fected in­dus­tries,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Kevin Cheong, chair­man of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore At­trac­tions, said the rate at which the JSS is ta­pered off should be de­ter­mined through an “eq­ui­table for­mula” that takes into ac­count the max­i­mum busi­ness ca­pac­ity of an es­tab­lish­ment amid Covid-19 curbs.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, most tourist at­trac­tions that have been al­lowed to re­open are cur­rently re­stricted to no more than 25 per cent of their op­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity at any one time, so they should get more sub­si­dies than those not fac­ing such lim­its.</p>
    <p>Mr Eddy Lau, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Spe­cial­ists Trade Al­liance of Sin­ga­pore, which rep­re­sents spe­cial­ist con­trac­tors and sup­pli­ers in build­ing and con­struc­tion, noted that the for­eign worker levy waiver was ex­tended to De­cem­ber for firms in the con­struc­tion sec­tor ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>While this ex­ten­sion will help those in the con­struc­tion sec­tor, many of which can­not restart work, he hopes such sup­port can be given to other firms in a sim­i­lar bind.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, some man­u­fac­tur­ers mainly sup­ply build­ing ma­te­ri­als like glass to con­struc­tion firms, and were also im­pacted when con­struc­tion work was slow to restart.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day he will de­liver a min­is­te­rial state­ment next Mon­day on how the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to sup­port work­ers and busi­nesses through the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said sup­port can­not be sus­tained at the same level in­def­i­nitely, and schemes will evolve and ta­per off as more sec­tors re­open.</p>
    <p>Mr Dou­glas Foo, pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore Man­u­fac­tur­ing Fed­er­a­tion, hopes to see more men­tal health sup­port for work­ers af­fected by the pan­demic as well as mea­sures to en­force rental re­lief for ten­ants. “This is not forth­com­ing from some land­lords,” he said.</p>
    <p>Dr Cheong and Mr Sim wel­comed Mr Heng’s an­nounce­ment that tar­geted sup­port will also be pro­vided to help hard-hit firms pivot to new op­por­tu­ni­ties. Dr Cheong called for such ini­tia­tives to be im­ple­mented in a “gran­u­lar and tar­geted man­ner”.</p>
    <p>With­out for­eign trav­ellers, for in­stance, the bulk of traf­fic for lo­cal at­trac­tions comes dur­ing week­ends and hol­i­days. “We have to con­sider how to ad­dress trends like this when we think about how we re­con­fig­ure our busi­nesses for the res­i­dent mar­ket,” he said.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mist Wal­ter Th­e­seira said some busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore, such as do­mes­tic-fac­ing con­sumer busi­nesses and man­u­fac­tur­ers in con­sumer and med­i­cal ne­ces­si­ties, are do­ing fine or bet­ter than be­fore, while oth­ers are see­ing rev­enues that are a frac­tion of last year’s.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing be­tween busi­nesses that are do­ing well and those that are not will be key as mea­sures con­tinue and evolve, he said.</p>
    <p>“For those who aren’t do­ing well, there needs to be a pivot in sup­port to­wards re­struc­tur­ing and trans­for­ma­tion,” As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Th­e­seira said, adding that he hoped to see more such mea­sures on top of broad-based wage sup­port.</p>
    <p>“The best out­come is that busi­nesses sur­vive, but if that is not pos­si­ble, the best out­come is that they exit grace­fully, which means that the sup­port should be ori­ented to­wards let­ting the busi­ness fold with­out mas­sive un­paid wages to work­ers, un­claimable debts and per­sonal bank­ruptcy of the own­ers.”</p>
    <p>Prof Th­e­seira added: “I think the idea should be to pro­tect peo­ple, whether work­ers or busi­ness own­ers, rather than just jobs, some of which are never go­ing to be vi­able within the next one to two years.”</p>
    <p>So­cial ser­vice or­gan­i­sa­tions should also get more fund­ing as they are now help­ing not only the ex­ist­ing poor but also the “new poor”, he said.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects Mr Heng to fund the latest round of mea­sures with the $13 bil­lion Con­tin­gen­cies Funds set aside in the For­ti­tude Bud­get in May. “We are al­ready close to the start of the Bud­get process for the next fi­nan­cial year and I ex­pect we’ll still be drag­ging our­selves out of this mess in 2021.”</p>
