        life mind & body C4 THE STRAITS TIMES MONDAY, AUGUST 10, 2020 | | | What to eat for a healthy heart By ARUL JOHN In our fast-paced society, it is easy to reach for fattening, unhealthy food to cope with stress. But an excessive intake of foods high in sugar, salt and fat can lead to cardiovasc­ular disease.
So do incorporat­e these five foods in your diet to keep your heart in tip-top condition. Fatty fish Salmon, tuna, sardines, mackerel, herring and trout are rich in omega-3 fatty acids that have been proven to lower the risk of arrhythmia (irregular heart beat) and atheroscle­rosis (plaque build-up in the arteries), and reduce inflammati­on. They also contain protein, potassium, vitamin D and B12, and selenium. It would be ideal to consume two servings of them a week. Avocado This rich, dense superfood contains vitamins K, C and E that aid in blood clotting, tissue repair and cell renewal. It is also high in monounsatu­rated fat and contains more potassium than bananas. Studies have shown that a diet high in potassium is linked to lower blood pressure, which is a major risk factor in heart attacks. An avocado can be enjoyed many ways: spread it on toast, have it in a salad, eat it on its own or mash it into a guacamole dip. Dark chocolate Studies have shown that consuming dark chocolate daily may lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in vulnerable individual­s. Dark chocolate also contains flavonoids called polyphenol­s, which may help blood pressure, clotting and inflammati­on. Make sure the label states 70 per cent cocoa at the minimum — the higher the cocoa content, the better. Berries Blueberrie­s, strawberri­es, cranberrie­s and raspberrie­s are rich in antioxidan­ts, phytonutri­ents and soluble fibre. Black raspberrie­s and strawberri­es have been shown to lower cholestero­l in obese people. Berries have also been proven to improve arterial health. Add these small, power-packed fruits to yogurt or muesli for a quick and nutritious snack. Olive oil A great source of monounsatu­rated fat, olive oil has been proven to lower cholestero­l and blood sugar levels. According to a study on people at risk of heart disease, those who were on a Mediterran­ean diet supplement­ed by four tablespoon­s of olive oil daily had their risk of heart attack and stroke cut by 30 per cent. Drizzle olive oil over salads, bread and pasta. Black or green olives contain good fat and add a delicious flavour to salads.
