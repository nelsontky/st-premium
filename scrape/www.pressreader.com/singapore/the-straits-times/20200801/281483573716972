    <p>Hong Kong’s leader fi­nally put an end to guesses on the city’s leg­isla­tive elec­tions due on Sept 6 by an­nounc­ing they would be post­poned for a year, in a con­tro­ver­sial move some say would cre­ate le­git­i­macy is­sues but that oth­ers say would pre­vent a hos­tile takeover of the Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (Legco).</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing this as “the hard­est” de­ci­sion she has had to make in the past seven months, Mrs Car­rie Lam said the pan­demic is too se­vere for an elec­tion to be held. The cen­tral au­thor­i­ties would ask the Na­tional Peo­ple’s Con­gress Stand­ing Com­mit­tee to make a de­ci­sion on how to fill the vac­uum that this move would cre­ate, she said. One op­tion could be to ex­tend the term of the cur­rent Legco, even though the Ba­sic Law, or the city’s mini-Con­sti­tu­tion, ex­plic­itly states that each Legco term is to last four years.</p>
    <p>In a con­tro­ver­sial move that was widely an­tic­i­pated, the city’s Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil (Legco) elec­tion to form a new gov­ern­ment – which was slated for next month – will be post­poned for a year due to the wors­en­ing coro­n­avirus out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam, whose sup­port lev­els have hit rock­bot­tom in the city, an­nounced this yes­ter­day, putting an end to days of spec­u­la­tion amid the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion of a dozen op­po­si­tion can­di­dates slated to run in the Legco elec­tion orig­i­nally sched­uled for Sept 6.</p>
    <p>The new date for the elec­tion is Sept 5 next year.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion camp had hoped to ride on the wave of pub­lic re­sent­ment against the na­tional se­cu­rity law im­posed on Hong Kong by Bei­jing on June 30 to win big at the Legco elec­tion, much like the land­slide vic­tory in last Novem­ber’s district coun­cil elec­tions.</p>
    <p>At a brief­ing yes­ter­day evening, Mrs Lam said she would in­voke the colo­nial-era emer­gency law, used to im­pose a face mask ban last year, to fa­cil­i­tate the move. “In these seven months, I’ve had to make some hard choices. But this an­nounce­ment is the hard­est one yet.”</p>
    <p>For the 10th day in a row, Hong Kong added more than 100 new in­fec­tions, with the 121 cases yes­ter­day bring­ing the to­tal con­firmed tally to 3,272, in­clud­ing 27 deaths.</p>
    <p>Of the new cases, 118 were due to lo­cal spread and the source of many cases was un­known.</p>
    <p>For over a month, lo­cal clus­ters have grown quickly, and pres­sure is mount­ing on the city’s health­care sys­tems and test­ing fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the gov­ern­ment fur­ther tight­ened so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures in an at­tempt to con­tain lo­cal trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>“At this point in time, there’s no way to ef­fec­tively erad­i­cate this (coro­n­avirus) al­to­gether,” Mrs Lam said yes­ter­day, adding that the move has the full backing of the cen­tral gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The same day, China’s For­eign Min­istry said Hong Kong’s elec­tions are China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs, and due con­sid­er­a­tion would be given to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the day, 22 pro-democ­racy law­mak­ers blasted the pos­si­bil­ity of such a move, call­ing it a power grab that would trig­ger a con­sti­tu­tional cri­sis. They said the post­pone­ment is a con­spir­acy by the gov­ern­ment and its sup­port­ers as the gov</p>
    <p>DIF­FI­CULT DE­CI­SION</p>
    <p>In these seven months, I’ve had to make some hard choices. But this an­nounce­ment is the hard­est one yet. ’’</p>

    <p>CAR­RIE LAM</p>
    <p>ern­ment may not do well at the polls.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion was to be the for­mer Bri­tish colony’s first demo­cratic ex­er­cise since Bei­jing im­posed the se­cu­rity law – which car­ries pun­ish­ment of life im­pris­on­ment – against se­ces­sion, sub­ver­sion, ter­ror­ism and col­lu­sion with for­eign forces.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing and the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment have re­as­sured peo­ple that the law af­fects only an ex­tremely small num­ber of peo­ple and will not un­der­mine the city’s free­doms guar­an­teed un­der the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” prin­ci­ple that has been in place since 1997. They ar­gued that the law is vi­tal to re­store or­der and pros­per­ity af­ter over half a year of of­ten vi­o­lent anti-gov­ern­ment protests last year.</p>
    <p>But the op­po­si­tion camp and ac­tivists be­lieve the law not only spells the end of the city’s high de­gree of au­ton­omy, but also paves the way for crackdown on dis­sent.</p>
    <p>And the clear­est ex­am­ple, they say, is Thurs­day’s dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion from the Legco elec­tion of 12 op­po­si­tion can­di­dates, in­clud­ing ac­tivist Joshua Wong and the Civic Party’s Mr Den­nis Kwok, Mr Kwok Ka Ki and Mr Alvin Ye­ung, many of whom op­pose the se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong yes­ter­day said the rea­sons for his dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion were ridicu­lous and called the move a “witch-hunt”, ac­cus­ing elec­tion of­fi­cials of twist­ing his views so that they can pros­e­cute him un­der the se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>When asked, As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor</p>
    <p>Sing Ming of the Hong Kong Univer­sity of Sci­ence and Tech­nol­ogy said the can­di­dates’ dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion comes as the level of sup­port for Bei­jing and the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment is at a record low, a re­flec­tion of peo­ple’s trust in the “one coun­try, two sys­tems” prin­ci­ple.</p>
    <p>“To­gether with the wide­spread sus­pi­cion and dis­ap­proval of the na­tional se­cu­rity law, it is quite nat­u­ral to con­clude that Bei­jing would like to use the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion to pre­clude the cat­a­strophic re­sult for the pro-Bei­jing camp,” he said.</p>
    <p>The scope of the dis­qual­i­fi­ca­tion has been wider than an­tic­i­pated by many ob­servers, he noted, adding that mod­er­ates have also been booted out.</p>
    <p>In the light of this, Prof Sing said it would be ex­tremely con­tro­ver­sial to post­pone the elec­tion for so long as it would “cre­ate all kinds of le­git­i­macy prob­lems”.</p>
    <p>But Mr Lau Siu Kai, vice-pres­i­dent of the Chi­nese As­so­ci­a­tion of Hong Kong and Ma­cau Stud­ies, said the elec­tion “is no longer just Hong Kong’s in­ter­nal af­fairs”, but also a na­tional af­fair that in­volves na­tional se­cu­rity and ques­tions as to whether ex­ter­nal forces have united with the op­po­si­tion camp to seize power.</p>
    <p>“So that prompts Bei­jing into do­ing some­thing to pre­vent the hos­tile forces from tak­ing over the Legco and to make sure that the na­tional se­cu­rity is safe­guarded,” he said.</p>
