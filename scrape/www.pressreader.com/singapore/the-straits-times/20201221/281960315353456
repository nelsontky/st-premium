    <p>This year has awak­ened us to the fact that we die. We’ve al­ways known it to be true in a tech­ni­cal sense, but a pan­demic de­mands that we in­ter­nalise this un­der­stand­ing. It’s one thing to ac­knowl­edge the deaths of oth­ers, and an­other to ac­cept our own.</p>
    <p>It’s not just emo­tion­ally tax­ing; it is dif­fi­cult even to con­ceive. To do this means to imag­ine it, reckon with it and, most im­por­tant, per­son­alise it. Your life. Your death.</p>
    <p>Covid-19’s daily death and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion tal­lies read like ticker tape or the weather re­port. Last week, the death toll passed 300,000 in the United States. World­wide, it’s more than</p>
    <p>1.6 mil­lion. The cu­mu­la­tive ef­fect is shock fa­tigue or numb­ness, but in­stead of turn­ing away, we need to fold death into our lives.</p>
    <p>We re­ally have only two choices: to share life with death or to be robbed by death. Fight, flight or freeze. This is how we an­i­mals are wired to re­spond to any­thing that threat­ens our ex­is­tence. We haven’t evolved – morally or so­cially – to deal with a health­care sys­tem with tech­no­log­i­cal pow­ers that verge on godly. Dy­ing is no longer so in­tu­itive as it once was. Modern medicine can sub­vert na­ture’s course in many ways, at least for a while.</p>
    <p>As de­fined by science</p>
    <p>What is death? I’ve thought a lot about the ques­tion, though it took me many years of prac­tis­ing medicine even to re­alise that I needed to ask it. Like al­most any­one, I fig­ured death was a sim­ple fact, a sin­gu­lar event. A noun. Ob­nox­ious, but clearer in its bor­ders than just about any­thing else. The End.</p>
    <p>In fact, no mat­ter how many times I’ve si­dled up to it, or how many words I’ve tried on, I still can’t say what it is. If we strip away the poetry and ap­plique our cul­ture uses to try to make sense of death, we are left with a husk of a body. No pulse, no brain waves, no in­spi­ra­tion, no ex­pla­na­tion. Death is de­fined by what it lacks.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Uni­form De­ter­mi­na­tion of Death Act of 1981, you are dead if you have sus­tained “either ir­re­versible ces­sa­tion of cir­cu­la­tory and res­pi­ra­tory func­tions” or “ir­re­versible ces­sa­tion of all func­tions of the en­tire brain, in­clud­ing the brain stem” – in other words, no heart­beat and no breath­ing, which is ob­vi­ous enough, or no brain func­tion, which re­quires an elec­troen­cephalo­gram. These are the words we use to de­scribe one of the most pro­found events in hu­man ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Either way, a doc­tor or nurse needs to pro­nounce you dead for it to be of­fi­cial. Un­til then, you are legally alive. If we stay fo­cused on the body, the most con­crete thing about us, it be­comes dif­fi­cult to say whether death ex­ists at all. From the time you are born, your body is turn­ing over. The life span of your red blood cells, for ex­am­ple, is 115 days. At your health­i­est, liv­ing is a process of dy­ing. A vi­tal ten­sion holds you to­gether un­til the truce is bro­ken.</p>
    <p>But your death is not the end of your body. The chem­i­cal bonds that held you to­gether at the molec­u­lar level con­tinue to break in the min­utes and months af­ter you die. The en­ergy that once an­i­mated the body doesn’t stop: It trans­forms. De­cay from one an­gle, growth from an­other. Un­fet­tered, the de­cay process con­tin­ues un­til all that was your body be­comes some­thing else, liv­ing on in oth­ers – in the grass and trees that grow from where you might come to rest, and from the crit­ters who eat there. Even af­ter in­ter­ment or cre­ma­tion, your atoms re­main in­tact and scat­ter to be­come other things, just as they pre-ex­isted you and be­came you.</p>
    <p>Be­com­ing a blade of grass</p>
    <p>For rev­e­la­tion of the mys­ter­ies of an af­ter­life, or of the forces that kicked off this won­drous cir­cus in the first place, we might look to re­li­gion. What is de­scribed above is plainly ob­serv­able science. Yet science doesn’t do the ques­tion jus­tice. It won’t tell us why, or what’s be­hind its laws. You are more than your body. Be­com­ing a blade of grass is a sweet­ness that doesn’t com­pen­sate for all the heartache death con­notes.</p>
    <p>Of course, we’re sad and afraid of los­ing our­selves and peo­ple we love, but for many of us a fear of death as the Great Un­known has been over­taken by our fears of what we know – or think we know</p>
    <p>– about dy­ing. Given a steadily aw­ful diet of sto­ries about breath­ing ma­chines and peo­ple dy­ing alone, we’re told to imag­ine the worst, be­fore cut­ting to a com­mer­cial.</p>
    <p>Maybe our fear of death has more to do with our per­cep­tions of re­al­ity than with re­al­ity it­self, and that is good news. Even if we can’t change what we’re look­ing at, we can change how we look at it. We do have fuller ways of know­ing.</p>
    <p>Who doubts that imag­i­na­tion and in­tu­ition and love hold power and ca­pac­ity beyond what lan­guage can de­scribe? You are a per­son with con­scious­ness and emo­tions and ties. You live on in those you’ve touched, in hearts and minds. You af­fect peo­ple. Just re­mem­ber those who’ve died be­fore you. There’s your im­mor­tal­ity. There, in you, they live. Maybe this force wanes over time, but it is never noth­ing.</p>
    <p>And then there’s con­scious­ness – spirit, if you like – and of this, who can say? You may have your own an­swer to this ques­tion, but we do not get to fall back on em­piri­cism. What­ever this mys­tery is, it blurs all the lines that seem at first glance to sep­a­rate death from life. And if death isn’t so con­crete, or sep­a­rate, maybe it isn’t so fright­en­ing.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is a per­sonal and global dis­as­ter, but it is also a mo­ment to look at the big pic­ture of life. Ear­lier last week I had a pa­tient lean into her com­puter’s cam­era and whis­per to me that she ap­pre­ci­ates what the pan­demic is do­ing for her: She has been liv­ing through the fi­nal stages of can­cer for a while, only now her friends are more able to re­late to her uncer­tain­ties, and that em­pa­thy is a balm. I’ve heard many, in hushed tones, say that these times are shak­ing them into clar­ity.</p>
    <p>That clar­ity may show up as un­mit­i­gated sor­row or dis­com­fort, but that is hon­est and real, and it is it­self a pow­er­ful sign of life. So, again, what is death? Talk­ing about and around it may be the best we can do, and do­ing so out loud is fi­nally wel­come. Facts alone won’t get you there. We’re al­ways left with the next big­gest ques­tion, one that is an­swer­able and more use­ful any­way: What is death to you?</p>
    <p>When do you know you’re done? What are you liv­ing for in the mean­time? For some of us, death is reached when all other loved ones have per­ished, or when we can no longer think straight, or go to the bath­room by our­selves, or have some kind of sex; when we can no longer read a book, or eat pizza; when our body can no longer live with­out the as­sis­tance of a ma­chine; when there is ab­so­lutely noth­ing left to try.</p>
    <p>If I had to an­swer the ques­tion to­day I would say that, for me, death is when I can no longer en­gage with the world around me. When I can no longer take any­thing in and, there­fore, can no longer con­nect.</p>
    <p>At times, so­cial dis­tanc­ing has me won­der­ing if I’m there al­ready, but that’s just me miss­ing touch­ing the peo­ple I care about. There are still ways to con­nect with oth­ers, in­clud­ing the bit­ter­sweet act of miss­ing them. And be­sides, I get to touch the planet all day long. These are help­ful ques­tions to con­sider as you weigh se­ri­ous med­i­cal treat­ment op­tions, or any time you have to choose whether to mo­bilise your fi­nite en­ergy to push, or use it to let go.</p>
    <p>What is it you hold dear?</p>
    <p>Our an­swers may be dif­fer­ent, but they are al­ways ac­tion­able; they are ends around which we and our in­ner cir­cles and our doc­tors can make crit­i­cal de­ci­sions. They also have a way of il­lu­mi­nat­ing char­ac­ter. They are an ex­pres­sion of self, the self who will one day do the dy­ing and so gets to say. What is it you hold dear?</p>
    <p>Who are you, or who do you wish to be? You can see how death is bet­ter framed by what you care about than by the ab­sence of a pulse or a brain wave. Beyond fear and iso­la­tion, maybe this is what the pan­demic holds for us: the un­der­stand­ing that liv­ing in the face of death can set off a cas­cade of re­al­i­sa­tion and ap­pre­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Death is the force that shows you what you love and urges you to revel in that love while the clock ticks. Rev­el­ling in love is one sure way to see through and beyond your­self to the wider world, where im­mor­tal­ity lives.</p>
    <p>A pretty bril­liant sys­tem, re­ally, show­ing you who you are (lim­ited) and all that you’re a part of (vast). As a con­nect­ing force, love makes a per­son much more re­sis­tant to oblit­er­a­tion. You might have to loosen your need to know what lies ahead. Rather than spend so much en­ergy keep­ing pain at bay, you might want to sus­pend your judg­ment and let your body do what a body does.</p>
    <p>If the past, present and fu­ture come to­gether, as we sense they must, then death is a process of be­com­ing. So, once more, what is death? If you’re read­ing this, you still have time to re­spond. Since there’s no known right an­swer, you can’t get it wrong. You can even make your life the an­swer to the ques­tion.</p>
