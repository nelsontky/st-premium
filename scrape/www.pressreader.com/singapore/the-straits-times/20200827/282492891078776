    <p>Film­ing the sci­ence-fic­tion Tai­wanese drama Dream Raider was no easy feat for stars We­ber Yang and Ellen Wu.</p>
    <p>In the HBO Asia orig­i­nal, Yang, 39, had a scene in which he suavely res­cues Wu by car­ry­ing her on his shoul­ders while fight­ing en­e­mies.</p>
    <p>But re­al­ity was much less heroic. The 26-year-old ac­tress says in a video in­ter­view with re­gional me­dia: “He bumped me on my head while we were go­ing through a door and I had to ice it for the swelling to sub­side.”</p>
    <p>An apolo­getic Yang says he bumped her head thrice on the same spot in the flurry of film­ing.</p>
    <p>He adds with a laugh: “I’ve never done some­thing so heroic in real life. At least Ellen is light and it’s easy to carry her while fight­ing.”</p>
    <p>Dream Raider airs at 9pm on Sun­days on HBO (StarHub TV Chan­nel 601, Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 420) and streams on HBO Go.</p>
    <p>The two stars play col­leagues­turned-lovers in the series – which is based on the idea of a new tech­nol­ogy that al­lows peo­ple to en­ter oth­ers’ dream­scapes. Yang plays a cop in­ves­ti­gat­ing a case of miss­ing girls and works with Wu’s neu­rol­ogy ex­pert char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>He says of the sci­ence-fic­tion el­e­ment of the story: “It’s easy to get into the mood of the story be­cause a lot of our sets are built phys­i­cally, like the dream-raider ma­chine.”</p>
    <p>Ris­ing ac­tress Wu, who started act­ing in 2016, says ex­cit­edly: “I’ve never acted in front of a green screen and I had a lot of help pro­fes­sion­ally.</p>
    <p>“There is a spe­cial-ef­fects di­rec­tor on set, so I know how the ef­fects will look like, when it’ll ap­pear and the rest is up to my imag­i­na­tion. It feels like I’m act­ing in a Hol­ly­wood pro­duc­tion.”</p>
    <p>As t he rookie cast mem­ber among vet­er­ans like Yang, Tai­wanese ac­tress Vi­vian Hsu, Tai­wanese ac­tors Ja­son Wang and David Wang – she was well taken care of by her cast mates.</p>
    <p>“Vi­vian found out that my waist was in­jured pre­vi­ously, so from the mo­ment we met, she started giv­ing me health ad­vice and tips on tak­ing care of my body. She even made an ap­point­ment for me to do a health check-up and took care of ev­ery­thing,” she says.</p>
    <p>And Yang made sure she felt com­fort­able in the in­ti­mate scenes be­tween them.</p>
    <p>“I told her not to worry be­fore our kiss scene be­cause I brushed my teeth,” he says.</p>
    <p>Wu adds that it was driz­zling on the day they filmed the scene and the at­mos­phere was “very ro­man­tic”.</p>
    <p>The on­screen re­la­tion­ship be­tween an­other pair of cast mates – Wu Ke-hsi and Ja­son Wang – is much more sin­is­ter.</p>
    <p>This is a rare ven­ture into tele­vi­sion for Wu, who is well-known as a film ac­tress in Golden Horse-nom­i­nated movies such as The Road To Man­dalay (2016), The Bold, The Cor­rupt And The Beau­ti­ful (2017) and Nina Wu (2019).</p>
    <p>But she was con­vinced by the project once she read the script.</p>
    <p>The 37-year-old ac­tress says: “Ev­ery episode felt like a mini movie with its own con­cept. And I was very drawn to the idea of do­ing ac­tion scenes be­cause I’ve hardly done them.</p>
    <p>“But be­fore act­ing, I was a hiphop dancer, so I’ve had some train­ing in terms of my body and I wanted to try fight scenes.”</p>
    <p>Her ac­tion scenes in the series were done pri­mar­ily with a katana – a Ja­panese sword – in a ki­mono as her mys­te­ri­ous an­tag­o­nist takes on the fight­ing style of a Ja­panese sa­mu­rai.</p>
    <p>Wu says she spent about two months prac­tis­ing with the katana.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing film­ing, she was wor­ried that she would draw blood from Wang, 52, who had to ex­change blows with her in the series.</p>
    <p>“The katana is quite sharp, so it’s dan­ger­ous,” she says.</p>
    <p>Wang, who plays Ellen Wu’s fa­ther and a ge­nius sci­en­tist in the drama, quips: “Thank god you have good aim then.”</p>
    <p>While it is not pos­si­ble to en­ter the dreams of oth­ers in real life, if they could, whose dream would they visit?</p>
    <p>Wu Ke-hsi has per­haps the most re­lat­able an­swer.</p>
    <p>She says: “Prob­a­bly the dreams of the men I like, to see if they like me.”</p>
    <p>Dream Raider airs at 9pm on Sun­days on HBO (StarHub TV Chan­nel 601, Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 420) and streams on HBO Go.</p>
