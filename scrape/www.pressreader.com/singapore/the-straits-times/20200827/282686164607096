    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Snap into ac­tion. Things are look­ing weird, but as long as you are ac­tive, you should be able to over­come most ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>This is not a good time to take risks. You may come out ahead, but some­thing about the sit­u­a­tion just does not sit right with you.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20) Do not sit back pas­sively and see what hap­pens. Get go­ing if you want to get any­where – that is the price of suc­cess.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>To help other peo­ple, you have to take care of your­self first. You do not have to aban­don your friends, just that you need a day to your­self.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are hav­ing too much fun. Whether at work or do­ing chores, you find lit­tle ways to make the time pass pleas­antly.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Things are rosy, but you may have to pass up on what looks like a great op­por­tu­nity. Your sense of what is pos­si­ble helps you through this.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are in the mid­dle of an ex­ploratory mis­sion, but you still have some way to go be­fore you can re­turn to your base camp.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Take a chance be­cause you may be able to af­ford mov­ing out be­yond your com­fort zone. Things are still go­ing in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Your ad­mi­ra­tion for the work of an­other could lead to a new friend­ship or part­ner­ship, and you will at­tract peo­ple who can help you.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) Your sense of right and wrong is deeply en­gaged and you should be able to get oth­ers to see things your way.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Call on a friend for help. He or she wants to feel im­por­tant and it is a great way to bond with him or her. If you get things done, all the bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Try to bear with an au­thor­ity fig­ure who is mak­ing life dif­fi­cult, but raise the mat­ter to a higher-up if things be­come in­tol­er­a­ble.</p>
