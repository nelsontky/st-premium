    <p>Shop­keep­ers in Wauke­sha watch­ing the news saw im­ages of civil un­rest on their screens dur­ing protests in the nearby city of Mil­wau­kee.</p>
    <p>So when a Black Lives Mat­ter march took place in their town, they slept in their stores, guns at hand, ready to de­fend their prop­erty.</p>
    <p>The march turned out to be com­pletely peace­ful, said home health­care nurs­ing as­sis­tant Laura Bur­bie, 55, who lives a stone’s throw from down­town Wauke­sha.</p>
    <p>But that these shop­keep­ers should ex­pect the worst was a sign that United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s racially charged mes­sage of up­hold­ing law and or­der still res­onates in white sub­ur­ban com­mu­ni­ties, even as vot­ers may be cool­ing on Mr Trump him­self.</p>
    <p>Wauke­sha, an af­flu­ent county of 400,000 that is 93 per cent white, and its neigh­bours Ozau­kee and Wash­ing­ton form the solidly Repub­li­can bloc of WOW coun­ties in south-eastern Wis­con­sin, whose turnout can some­times tilt the state red.</p>
    <p>Polls show the race be­tween Mr Trump and his Demo­cratic op­po­nent Joe Bi­den tight­en­ing in Wis­con­sin, and a slight ero­sion of Repub­li­can sup­port in the WOW coun­ties, a trend con­tin­u­ing from the 2016 elec­tion and 2018 midterms.</p>
    <p>Hints of this are, per­haps, the signs that adorn Wauke­sha’s man­i­cured lawns, along­side Hal­loween dec­o­ra­tions and fallen au­tumn leaves.</p>
    <p>The Wauke­sha County Demo­cratic Party de­liv­ered around 600 pro-Hil­lary Clin­ton yard signs in 2016, but has pushed out 4,000 Bi­den ones so far this year, with the elec­tion still three weeks away.</p>
    <p>“Trump is alien­at­ing a lot of mod­er­ate coun­try club Repub­li­cans, peo­ple who are wealth­ier, high­ere­d­u­cated. They def­i­nitely en­joy the lower tax rates that the Repub­li­can Party pushes. But they’re not re­ally on board with the racism, the ho­mo­pho­bia, the di­vi­sive­ness, the isola</p>
    <p>tion­ism that Trump is push­ing,” said lo­cal party chair­man Matt Mareno.</p>
    <p>The US was gripped by protests against po­lice bru­tal­ity in June, fol­low­ing the death in Min­nesota of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, an un­armed black man, at the hands of a white po­lice­man.</p>
    <p>For Wauke­sha res­i­dents, the mes­sage hit home in late Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Kenosha, an hour’s drive away, was rocked by protests af­ter an­other black man was shot seven times in the back by a cop there.</p>
    <p>The en­su­ing vi­o­lence, which in­cluded burn­ing, loot­ing and the killing of two pro­test­ers by a teenager, was de­nounced by Mr Bi­den and other ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>But polls show that sup­port for the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment slipped in Wis­con­sin over the sum­mer, from 59 per cent in favour in June to 49 per cent last month.</p>
    <p>For his part, Mr Trump, has di­rectly courted the vote of white sub­ur­ban women by promis­ing to up­hold law and or­der, con­trast­ing their sup­pos­edly white neigh­bour­hoods with so-called law­less cities with larger black pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>In­sur­ance agent Mike Lam­bert, 57, said: “If you want to protest, I’m fine with that. But once you cross the line into be­ing vi­o­lent and de­stroy­ing prop­erty, you’re no longer a pro­tester, you’re a ri­oter, and if you’re break­ing the law, you need to suf­fer the con­se­quences.”</p>
    <p>Re­tiree Ar­lene Klump, 73, said the protests in Kenosha were “aw­ful”, while her hus­band Ron said the Black Lives Mat­ter protests had been hi­jacked by out­siders who wanted to de­stroy their city.</p>
    <p>Mrs Klump said: “These peo­ple worked their whole lives to have a busi­ness to raise their fam­i­lies, and they’re go­ing in and burn­ing them up? That’s not right. That’s not the Amer­i­can way. Trump is not go­ing to let that hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>Ms Bur­bie added: “It’s civil un­rest and you’ve got to han­dle it, or we’re go­ing to have a civil war.”</p>
    <p>But she also said she was tired of Mr Trump’s de­meanour, which she saw as bor­der­ing on bul­ly­ing, and thought he had han­dled the coro­n­avirus pan­demic badly. “We have so much ru­ral area here, there’s no ex­cuse for this coun­try to have so many cases,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Bur­bie said she planned to stick with Mr Trump any­way be­cause she be­lieves Mr Bi­den has de­men­tia. She is also too op­posed to his run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris to vote Demo­crat.</p>
    <p>“I’m more than likely go­ing to end up vot­ing for Trump when I have a lot of rea­sons not to. So I’m scared of what the next four years are go­ing to bring,” she said.</p>
    <p>Other Repub­li­can vot­ers were sim­i­larly pes­simistic.</p>
    <p>Re­tired pro­fes­sor of Ger­man lit­er­a­ture Robert Jami­son, 78, said he was vot­ing for Mr Trump be­cause of his stance on abor­tion rights, but did not think he would win.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think that many peo­ple who sup­ported him are very happy with his style,” he said, adding that a Bi­den vic­tory might not be all bad.</p>
    <p>“I’m look­ing for­ward to four years of peace and quiet.”</p>
