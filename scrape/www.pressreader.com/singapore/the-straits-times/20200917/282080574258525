    <p>In the five years she worked as a free­lance drama ed­u­ca­tor, Ms Aisha Shaik often came across stu­dents with learn­ing dif­fi­cul­ties who would strug­gle to read or par­tic­i­pate in her class.</p>
    <p>Her teach­ing ex­pe­ri­ence piqued her in­ter­est in ed­u­cat­ing stu­dents out­side main­stream schools, and prompted her to take up a spe­cial­ist di­ploma in ed­u­ca­tional ther­apy last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Aisha, 27, was one of 59 newly minted spe­cial needs ed­u­ca­tors to grad­u­ate from the Dys­lexia As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (DAS) Acad­emy yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The cer­e­mony for this batch of stu­dents – the sev­enth to grad­u­ate from the acad­emy – was held on­line for the first time. The school, which is mark­ing its 10th year, has trained more than 500 grad­u­ates in master’s and di­ploma pro­grammes in the past decade.</p>
    <p>Ms Aisha, who is this year’s vale­dic­to­rian for her course, said the 10-month pro­gramme taught her how to fol­low a struc­tured method of teach­ing.</p>
    <p>She also learnt how to in­clude a fo­cus on phon­ics in her teach­ing, and strate­gies such as reg­u­larly re­view­ing what has been taught and con­duct­ing lis­ten­ing or read­ing com­pre­hen­sions at the end of class.</p>
    <p>She said: “One of the more mem­o­rable mo­ments in the class­room was when I was try­ing to teach a stu­dent how to say the word “go­rilla”, but she said “Godzilla” in­stead.</p>
    <p>“We have our silly mo­ments but I am glad to see stu­dents build­ing their con­fi­dence. And I al­ways re­as­sure them that their learn­ing dif­fer­ence is some­thing they are learn­ing to cope with, and that it’s okay.”</p>
    <p>The DAS Acad­emy is the train­ing arm of so­cial ser­vice agency DAS, which pro­vides ser­vices and sup­port for peo­ple with dys­lexia and other spe­cific learn­ing dif­fi­cul­ties in Sin­ga­pore and around the world.</p>
    <p>Some grad­u­ates from the acad­emy join DAS as ed­u­ca­tional ther­a­pists, while oth­ers re­turn to their own ed­u­ca­tional in­sti­tu­tions after com­plet­ing their course.</p>
    <p>DAS yes­ter­day said about 23,000 stu­dents from pre-school to sec­ondary school in Sin­ga­pore have dys­lexia that is se­vere enough to war­rant in­ter­ven­tion.</p>
    <p>About half of these chil­dren may also ex­pe­ri­ence learn­ing is­sues such as at­ten­tion deficit hyper­ac­tiv­ity dis­or­der, spe­cific lan­guage im­pair­ment, dyscal­cu­lia and dys­praxia.</p>
    <p>Dyscal­cu­lia refers to dif­fi­cul­ties in learn­ing math­e­mat­ics, such as count­ing and un­der­stand­ing the re­la­tion­ship be­tween num­bers.</p>
    <p>Dys­praxia af­fects a per­son’s phys­i­cal co­or­di­na­tion, which can af­fect a stu­dent’s per­for­mance in school, for ex­am­ple, the abil­ity to pro­duce writ­ten work.</p>
