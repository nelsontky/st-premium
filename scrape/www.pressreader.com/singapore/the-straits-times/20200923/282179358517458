    <p>Union lead­ers from the Na­tional Taxi As­so­ci­a­tion (NTA) and the Na­tional Pri­vate Hire Ve­hi­cles As­so­ci­a­tion (NPHVA) have been work­ing closely with our tri­par­tite part­ners since the on­set of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The tri­par­tite part­ners are the Min­istry of Man­power, Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The unions have con­veyed the con­cerns of driv­ers to them and given feed­back through var­i­ous di­a­logues, and the Gov­ern­ment has re­sponded promptly, rolling out the point-to-point sup­port pack­age in March, which has been en­hanced and ex­tended twice.</p>
    <p>The lat­est ex­ten­sion will con­tinue to pro­vide fi­nan­cial re­lief for driv­ers whose in­comes have suffered from a lack of tourists and a drop in lo­cal pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>NTUC and its Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute have also been help­ing to match driv­ers to al­ter­na­tive job op­tions.</p>
    <p>In March, NTUC linked up</p>
    <p>Fei Siong Food Man­age­ment with SMRT Taxis to pro­vide taxi driv­ers with ad­di­tional trans­port jobs.</p>
    <p>A pop-up Driver Care Cen­tre was also set up to sup­port point-to-point driv­ers in ap­ply­ing for fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance such as the NTUC Care Fund (Covid-19) and the Gov­ern­ment’s Driver</p>
    <p>Care Fund.</p>
    <p>NTUC also of­fered ad­di­tional train­ing al­lowance through the NTUC Train­ing Fund, on top of course fee sub­si­dies through the Union Train­ing As­sis­tance Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The NTA and NPHVA have as­sisted driv­ers to take up cour­ses in ar­eas such as se­cu­rity so that they can earn while they train, diver­sify their in­come streams and pick up skills they can fall back on.</p>
    <p>We have also guided driv­ers to ap­ply for the Gov­ern­ment’s Self-Em­ployed Per­sons In­come Re­lief Scheme.</p>
    <p>Our fo­cus now is to en­sure that they can con­tinue driv­ing safely – we en­cour­age them to go for the free coro­n­avirus swab test, track their own tem­per­a­ture, main­tain per­sonal hy­giene and dis­in­fect their ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>In the long term, the unions will work with stake­hold­ers on the land trans­port mas­ter­plan and the in­dus­try trans­for­ma­tion map to en­sure that driv­ers can earn a sus­tain­able in­come.</p>
    <p>The tri­par­tite re­la­tion­ship strength­ened dur­ing this try­ing pe­riod must con­tinue to grow stronger as it is needed to put us on the re­cov­ery path to­wards fu­ture growth.</p>
    <p>We hope that more re­stric­tions can be lifted to stim­u­late ac­tiv­i­ties which will ben­e­fit our driv­ers greatly.</p>
