    <p>A 49-year-old Bangladesh­i mi­grant worker was the sole com­mu­nity case re­ported by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) last night. His case is cur­rently un­linked.</p>
    <p>He was asymp­to­matic and was de­tected through rou­tine test­ing.</p>
    <p>MOH said that his sero­log­i­cal test re­sult has come back pos­i­tive, indi­cat­ing a past in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>There were three new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,904.</p>
    <p>There was one im­ported case among the new cases, a 19-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman who came back from In­done­sia. She was tested while serv­ing her stay-home no­tice and was asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>The last new coro­n­avirus case re­ported yes­ter­day is a mi­grant worker re­sid­ing in a dor­mi­tory. He was also asymp­to­matic and was de­tected through ros­tered rou­tine test­ing.</p>
    <p>No new lo­ca­tions were added by</p>
    <p>MOH yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 14 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,783 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 37 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 41 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. They make up 78 ac­tive coro­n­avirus cases in Sin­ga­pore yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day was the first time there were fewer than 100 ac­tive coro­n­avirus cases in Sin­ga­pore in the last seven months.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
