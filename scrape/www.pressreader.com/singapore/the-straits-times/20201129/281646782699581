    <p>Fiery words have been ex­changed be­tween Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim’s Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR) and its al­lies after a muchan­tic­i­pated show­down with the Muhyid­din Yassin ad­min­is­tra­tion never ma­te­ri­alis­ed­last week.</p>
    <p>The flash point came when a leader from his largest part­ner Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) called for the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) to be dis­banded if Malaysia’s op­po­si­tion leader re­fuses to apol­o­gise for the em­bar­rass­ing fail­ure to force a bloc vote against Bud­get 2021 on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>PH sources also told The Sun­day Times that the PKR pres­i­dent in­sisted he would still top­ple the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) govern­ment within a week, when con­fronted by the coali­tion’s 90 other MPs after the de­ba­cle on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>If this fails, Mr An­war said he would re­sign from the lead­er­ship of the al­liance and the op­po­si­tion bloc in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>How­ever, of­fi­cials from PKR’s PH al­lies be­lieve that the vow was made in the heat of the mo­ment after Mr An­war was chas­tised for in­struct­ing them not to sup­port a call for a show of hands against the bud­get.</p>
    <p>“Even if An­war re­signs as PH chief, the de­ci­sion will still need to be rat­i­fied by the pres­i­den­tial coun­cil,” an MP said.</p>
    <p>“The real ques­tion is – who can re­place him as PH’s prime min­is­ter can­di­date? It may be a ges­ture that he may not need to ful­fil.”</p>
    <p>Lo­cal news por­tal Astro Awani re­ported that Mr An­war’s of­fice has de­nied that he made such a pledge, de­scrib­ing the claims as “ir­re­spon­si­ble ac­tions aimed at caus­ing con­fu­sion”.</p>
    <p>Bud­get 2021’s sec­ond read­ing was se­cured with a sim­ple voice vote after only 13 op­po­si­tion MPs stood to call for a di­vi­sion, less than the 15 re­quired.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war backed away from call­ing for a bloc vote so that Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din’s ma­jor­ity would not be proven in a cru­cial Sup­ply Bill after po­ten­tial de­fec­tions from Umno failed to ma­te­ri­alise.</p>
    <p>Amid fury from sup­port­ers and grass­root mem­bers, PH law­mak­ers have tried to ex­plain the move as a tac­ti­cal one as there is still a fi­nal vote next month to test the PN ad­min­is­tra­tion’s ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity – 112 out of the 220-strong Par­lia­ment – be­fore the cru­cial bud­get is passed.</p>
    <p>But DAP youth wing sec­re­tary Eric Teh Hoong Keat, like other op­po­si­tion fig­ures who are not among the ranks of their 108 fed­eral leg­is­la­tors – 17 from par­ties that are not in the PH pact – lam­basted Mr An­war’s call to back away from chal­leng­ing the pas­sage of Bud­get 2021 at the sec­ond read­ing last week.</p>
    <p>The back­down came, he said, de­spite Mr An­war hav­ing “re­peat­edly ar­gued that he has ob­tained a strong ma­jor­ity i n Par­lia­ment, which could even lead to the suc­cess of a counter-coup” since Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“If An­war is still in­sis­tent that his judg­ment was cor­rect, then the DAP cen­tral lead­ers should de­ci­sively sever ties with PKR, put a stop to the al­liance to au­to­mat­i­cally dis­band Pakatan Hara­pan, and only main­tain min­i­mal co­op­er­a­tion with op­po­si­tion par­ties,” he said in a state­ment late on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war’s po­lit­i­cal sec­re­tary Farhash Mubarak and PKR Se­lan­gor youth chief Na­jwan Hal­imi con­demned their com­pa­triot and called for PH to “fo­cus on restor­ing the man­date” it won at the 2018 polls.</p>
    <p>“I urge DAP youth and its sec­re­tary not to so eas­ily for­get their place by mak­ing un­to­ward state­ments with­out re­fer­ring to their own party lead­er­ship,” Kota Ang­gerik assem­bly­man Na­jwan re­sponded yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But three MPs from the party, in­clud­ing Mr An­war’s daugh­ter Nu­rul Iz­zah, have ad­mit­ted the de­ci­sion not to call for a di­vi­sion “was a dis­ap­point­ment to many” and claimed they were merely “ad­her­ing to party dis­ci­pline”.</p>
    <p>Bukit Bin­tang di­vi­sion youth chief Sheikh Khuza­ifah Bawazeer, from PH’s third mem­ber Parti Amanah Ne­gara, also ac­cused Mr An­war of “once again throw­ing his friends un­der the bus, j ust like when he de­cided to ne­go­ti­ate with the group of pi­rates”, a ref­er­ence to the Umno fac­tion led by pres­i­dent Zahid Hamidi and for­mer premier Na­jib Razak, both of whom are fac­ing dozens of graft charges.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war has been seek­ing to cap­i­talise on dis­gruntle­ment within Umno at hav­ing to play sec­ond fid­dle to Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia.</p>
    <p>His ne­go­ti­a­tions with th­ese lead­ers – es­pe­cially Na­jib, who is ap­peal­ing a cor­rup­tion con­vic­tion in the 1MDB saga – has dis­com­fited his PH al­lies, with DAP mak­ing it clear that it would not work with an Umno led by th­ese fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Bud­get 2021 will go through the com­mit­tee stage over the next three weeks where each min­istry’s al­lo­ca­tion must be in­di­vid­u­ally ap­proved, be­fore cul­mi­nat­ing in a vote for the Sup­ply Bill to be read a third and fi­nal time on Dec 17.</p>
