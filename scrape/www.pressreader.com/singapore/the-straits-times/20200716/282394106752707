    <p>LON­DON • Frank Lam­pard ad­mit­ted Chelsea are strug­gling with nerves as they chase a place in the Cham­pi­ons League next sea­son af­ter Olivier Giroud scored the only goal in a 1-0 Pre­mier League win over al­ready rel­e­gated Nor­wich at Stam­ford Bridge on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Vic­tory opens up a four-point edge for third-placed Chelsea (63) over Le­ices­ter and Manch­ester United, who both play their game in hand to­day.</p>
    <p>But Lam­pard knows there is still plenty of work to do in Chelsea’s fi­nal two league games of the sea­son, with a trip to cham­pi­ons Liver­pool to come, be­fore Wolves visit Stam­ford Bridge.</p>
    <p>“I want more but that can wait. Where we are at as a team and our po­si­tion in the ta­ble, three points is ev­ery­thing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We need to move the ball quicker, not take too many touches and al­low the op­po­si­tion to be com­pact. If we want to re­ally move up, longer term, then it can be bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“But I don’t want to be too crit­i­cal af­ter three points at this stage. It’s not easy, there is a nervy feel­ing there for un­der­stand­able rea­sons.”</p>
    <p>The Chelsea boss was fu­ri­ous with his side’s lack of fight in sur­ren­der­ing to a 3-0 de­feat at Sh­effield United last Satur­day that dealt their chances of a top-four fin­ish a blow.</p>
    <p>He made five changes from the bat­ter­ing at Bra­mall Lane with Giroud among those re­stored to the start­ing line-up.</p>
    <p>Chelsea have al­ready bol­stered their at­tack sig­nif­i­cantly for next sea­son with the sign­ing of Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech.</p>
    <p>But Giroud more than jus­ti­fied the de­ci­sion to also ex­tend his con­tract by a year dur­ing the league’s shut­down by be­com­ing the team’s most po­tent striker since the restart.</p>
    <p>The French­man saw a num­ber of chances come and go in the first half as an at­tempted lob over Tim Krul fell gen­tly into the Dutch goal­keeper’s arms be­fore he sliced well over the bar when un­marked in­side the area.</p>
    <p>Just as Nor­wich looked set to hold out un­til the break, he shrugged off Timm Klose to con­nect with Chris­tian Pulisic’s cross for his fourth goal in seven league games.</p>
    <p>“I missed some I don’t miss usu­ally,” said Giroud.</p>
    <p>“I lost a bit of con­fi­dence but my de­sire to score was big­ger, so I just tried to stay fo­cused.”</p>
