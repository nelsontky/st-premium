    <p>If in­de­pen­dent book­store War­dah Books gets crowded these days, pa­trons may browse for only 15 min­utes. When more than five peo­ple wan­der into the Bus­so­rah Street shop­house, owner Ibrahim Tahir locks the door to pre­vent more from com­ing in.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple get frus­trated,” says the 46-year-old. “But these have to be the rules now.”</p>
    <p>These are dif­fi­cult days in which to run a brick-and-mor­tar book­store in Sin­ga­pore, in be­tween the drought of the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker and phase one pe­ri­ods and the safe dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions that pre­vent book­sellers from host­ing the events that usu­ally draw cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent book­store Book­sAc­tu­ally an­nounced ear­lier this month that it would be clos­ing its iconic Tiong Bahru store and go­ing fully on­line. It is mov­ing to a shop­house in Jalan Be­sar, from which it will run its web­store and, when phase three rolls round, once more hold the events that made it one of the linch­pins of the lo­cal lit­er­ary com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The 16 book­stores The Straits Times spoke to said that brick-and­mor­tar sales have plum­meted since be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, some by 30 per cent, oth­ers by as much as 90 per cent.</p>
    <p>On­line sales surged in this time. At War­dah, which spe­cialises in books about Mus­lim is­sues, Mr Ibrahim was shocked to see his web­store go from 10 to 100 or­ders a day.</p>
    <p>As he had sent his staff home be­fore the cir­cuit breaker, he had to han­dle the or­ders alone.</p>
    <p>“It was quite tough, but we knew we had to meet the mo­ment and es­tab­lish a big­ger foothold in the on­line book busi­ness,” he says.</p>
    <p>Some tried new strate­gies. In May, Pop­u­lar launched its on­line store on LazMall, Lazada’s e-com­merce plat­form.</p>
    <p>Times Book­stores be­gan hold­ing book sales over Face­book Live, with cus­tomers tex­ting a num­ber to place or­ders. This, plus its Web plat­form Goguru.sg, in­creased its on­line sales five­fold, a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>But for most book­stores, on­line gains have not been enough to make up for lost foot­fall. Basheer Graphic Books owner Ab­dul Nasser, 56, said that while Covid-19 drove home the po­ten­tial of his web­store, it has not re­placed lost earn­ings at his Bras Basah store, es­pe­cially from visi­tors from around the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, book re­tailer Clos­et­ful Of Books saw sales at its web­store go up by 50 per cent, but though it has no phys­i­cal store­front to worry about, much of its busi­ness still de­pends on school book fairs.</p>
    <p>“This means set­ting up an on­line or­der­ing sys­tem for par­ents and also do­ing on­line book talks for the classes so that we can give as much of the face-to-face book fair ex­pe­ri­ence to the kid­dos,” says co-founder Denise Tan, 32. Still, she adds, it is hard to vir­tu­ally repli­cate the ex­pe­ri­ence of rec­om­mend­ing a book to a child.</p>
    <p>At least two book­store own­ers said that with­out the Government’s Jobs Sup­port Scheme sub­si­dis­ing staff pay, they would have al­ready folded.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t have a web­store then, so we were caught off guard, ke­lam kabut (Malay for a chaotic panic),” says Ms Shan­non Ong ,43, co-owner of Book­sAc­tu­ally’s neigh­bour, chil­dren’s store Woods In The Books, as well as Books Ahoy! in Fo­rum The Shop­ping Mall.</p>
    <p>“By the end of May, our com­pany bank ac­count had three dig­its in it. Our monthly rent is four fig­ures.”</p>
    <p>To sur­vive, it be­gan cu­rat­ing care packs of books and toys to send to cus­tomers, field­ing queries over What­sApp well into the night be­cause it feared los­ing a sin­gle sale. “Ev­ery pack­age I sent out was hope,” says Ms Ong.</p>
    <p>Many had to tighten the belt. At pub­lisher Epi­gram Books, staff took a 20 to 25 per cent pay cut. Founder Ed­mund Wee halved his own salary.</p>
    <p>Huggs-Epi­gram Cof­fee Book­shop, which Epi­gram opened with cof­fee chain Huggs in the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity Cen­tre in March last year, has had a third of its brief life blighted by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We had not sta­bilised,” says Mr Wee, 68. “To have to stop op­er­a­tions at that out­let was a blow.”</p>
    <p>He adds that Huggs is now ne­go­ti­at­ing with its land­lord for a lower rent, with­out which the book cafe’s fu­ture is un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>Es­pe­cially hard hit were the book­shops with zero on­line pres­ence, like some of the old-school Chi­nese-lan­guage book­stores in Bras Basah Com­plex, where many se­nior cus­tomers still pre­fer to browse in per­son.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo Oi Sang, 81, has spent 64 years in the books busi­ness, 38 of them run­ning Xin­hua Cul­tural En­ter­prises in Bras Basah Com­plex. This is the worst things have ever been, he says in Man­darin.</p>
    <p>“I haven’t drawn a salary in six years. Now busi­ness is down 90 per cent. I don’t even know how we’re go­ing to pay the util­ity bills.”</p>
    <p>When book­stores were al­lowed to open in June, peo­ple queued in droves as the shut­ters rolled up on Books Ki­noku­niya’s main store in Ngee Ann City.</p>
    <p>Three months on, the ex­cite­ment has wa­vered. A spokesman said that though snaking queues are still seen on week­end af­ter­noons, these do not nec­es­sar­ily trans­late into sales. It is work­ing on in­tro­duc­ing more pre-or­der­ing of up­com­ing pub­li­ca­tions, as well as back-or­der­ing of ti­tles not stocked at its three phys­i­cal out­lets.</p>
    <p>One chal­lenge book­sellers face is de­layed stocks, as the sup­ply chain takes a ham­mer­ing from the pan­demic. “Tell some cus­tomers to wait eight weeks,” says Woods In The Books’ Ms Ong, “and they will go on­line to Ama­zon.”</p>
    <p>An­other is jug­gling safe dis­tanc­ing with turnover. The Moon in Chi­na­town re­cently in­tro­duced a 90-minute limit for its cafe on week­ends. “We don’t want to tell peo­ple to leave,” says owner Sarah Naeem, 29, “but some­one buy­ing a cof­fee in the morning and stay­ing for five hours is not good for the bot­tom line.”</p>
    <p>Chi­nese-lan­guage book­shop City Book Room has put in place safe man­age­ment mea­sures like tem­per­a­ture-tak­ing and dis­in­fect­ing books, though owner Tan Wain Ching, 37, quips that it is not like it gets many walk-ins any­way. “We prac­tise so­cial dis­tanc­ing all the time.”</p>
    <p>A book­store owner’s big­gest en­emy is rental, she adds. “We just re­newed a two-year con­tract with our land­lord be­fore the cir­cuit breaker. So we need to move for­ward.”</p>
    <p>De­spite rental woes com­pounded with down­turn-damp­ened con­sumer sen­ti­ment, most book­sellers still want to hold on to their phys­i­cal stores.</p>
    <p>“We can­not go fully on­line,” says Chi­nese-lan­guage book­store Union Book Co’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Mar­garet Ma, 54, in Man­darin. “Our cus­tomers, old peo­ple es­pe­cially, want to walk around Bras Basah Com­plex, look at books and have tea down­stairs. They need this sense of com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>At neigh­bour­ing Maha Yu Yi, gen­eral man­ager Sung Jee Tong, 55, agrees. “It’s like (ath­letic shoe brand) Nike. You can get its shoes on­line, but it still needs to have a phys­i­cal store so you can try them on be­fore you buy.”</p>
    <p>But Covid-19 has nev­er­the­less com­pelled them, and other book­stores, to make fresh for­ays into the dig­i­tal sphere, from The Moon’s new lit­er­ary pod­cast, The Same Page, to the mi­crosite that Clos­et­ful Of Books is build­ing for the up­com­ing Sin­ga­pore Writ­ers Fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, Epi­gram launched its re­vamped web­store, which com­bines its own pub­li­ca­tions with ti­tles from the Huggs-Epi­gram shop. In the fu­ture, it will add those from Lo­calBooks.sg, an on­line plat­form for lo­cal books.</p>
    <p>MPH Book­stores, which has one Sin­ga­pore out­let at SingPost Cen­tre but no lo­cal web­store, is de­vel­op­ing a new “omni-chan­nel” plat­form to be launched next year.</p>
    <p>MPH chief op­er­at­ing of­fi­cer Don­ald Kee de­clines to re­veal de­tails, but says this plan pre-dates the Covid-19 out­break. “On­line will be our main driver while re­tail will be a sub­set of our on­line store for cus­tomers to touch and feel as well as in­ter­act with our ser­vice staff.”</p>
    <p>En­ter­ing into the on­line re­tail scene will mean con­tend­ing with Ama­zon Sin­ga­pore. The e-com­merce gi­ant has be­gun mak­ing its pres­ence felt of late in the lo­cal lit­er­ary scene, spon­sor­ing a prize at this year’s Sin­ga­pore Book Awards. There are more than 2,000 lo­cal ti­tles avail­able on Ama­zon.sg.</p>
    <p>“Ama­zon pro­vides the op­por­tu­nity for small busi­nesses to stand be­side big brands and for lo­cal books to be placed be­side in­ter­na­tional best­sellers on­line,” says a spokesman.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve we can help the lo­cal book com­mu­nity grow be­yond the</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore scene in the long term.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wee says he was re­luc­tant to let Ama­zon sell Epi­gram’s ti­tles, but it ac­quired them through his dis­trib­u­tor any­way. “It’s a dou­ble-edged sword,” he says. “It would be nice if they also helped us sell our books over­seas, but they don’t.”</p>
    <p>Mr Peter Schop­pert, a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the Sin­ga­pore Book Pub­lish­ers As­so­ci­a­tion, which or­gan­ises the Sin­ga­pore Book Awards, says that hav­ing highly ef­fec­tive on­line book­sellers in the lo­cal mar­ket is im­por­tant, es­pe­cially in times like the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>But he adds: “Ama­zon’s prac­tice of deep dis­count­ing from re­tail prices does un­der­cut the al­ready pre­car­i­ous sit­u­a­tion of our lo­cal book­shops.</p>
    <p>“If the dis­counts are the re­sult of greater ef­fi­cien­cies, that is one thing, but if Ama­zon is us­ing books as a loss leader to build mar­ket share for other prod­uct cat­e­gories, as it did in the United States, that’s dam­ag­ing to our in­dus­try. In many other coun­tries, poli­cies are in place to pro­tect the lo­cal books ecosys­tem from such prac­tices.”</p>
    <p>Books Ki­noku­niya con­sul­tant Kenny Chan, 68, says com­pe­ti­tion is pos­i­tive, pro­vided it is on a level play­ing field. “We have other charms to draw cus­tomers,” he adds, cit­ing Ki­noku­niya’s range and cu­ra­tion, which de­pend not just on data but the tastes of in-house mer­chan­dis­ers and buy­ers.</p>
    <p>Over in Chi­na­town, as The Moon passes its sec­ond birth­day qui­etly prep­ping for next month’s launch of a new sub­scrip­tion box of “things we think you should be read­ing”, Ms Naeem seems un­fazed.</p>
    <p>“Brick-and-mor­tar book­stores re­main im­por­tant,” she says. “But we should be open to ex­plor­ing the pos­si­bil­i­ties of how the dig­i­tal land­scape can al­low us to reach more peo­ple. We’re still re­search­ing what that on­line com­mu­nity looks like.”</p>
