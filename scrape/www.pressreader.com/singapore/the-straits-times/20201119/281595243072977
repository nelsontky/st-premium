    <p>Un­der-fire coach Joachim Low has lim­ited op­tions to over­haul his slump­ing Ger­many foot­ball team and get them ready to chal­lenge at next year’s post­poned Euro­pean Cham­pi­onship. A 6-0 thump­ing by Spain – their worst in 89 years – cost them a place in the Na­tions League semi-fi­nals for the se­cond event run­ning.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>Ger­many are run­ning out of time to have an over­hauled yet com­pet­i­tive team at next year’s Euro­pean Cham­pi­onship, with coach Joachim Low’s changes so far fail­ing to de­liver.</p>
    <p>A 6-0 de­mo­li­tion by Spain on Tues­day was their heav­i­est de­feat in 89 years and only added to their fluc­tu­at­ing form in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Low tried to put on a brave front, la­belling the ham­mer­ing as a “dis­as­trous day” but the 60-year-old, in his 14th year in charge, has now seen his team exit in the first round of a tour­na­ment for the third straight time.</p>
    <p>The 2014 World Cup win­ners suf­fered their first group-stage exit four years later in Rus­sia and Die Mannschaft failed to win a sin­gle game in last year’s in­au­gu­ral Na­tions League.</p>
    <p>Low has at­tempted to bring in fresh blood by drop­ping the vet­eran trio of Thomas Muller, Jerome Boateng and Mats Hum­mels, who were all cor­ner­stones of their tri­umph in Brazil.</p>
    <p>But they have now won j ust three of their last eight in­ter­na­tion­als and their Group 4 loss to Spain meant the hosts ad­vanced to the Na­tions League Fi­nals at the vis­i­tors’ ex­pense.</p>
    <p>The rout could have been far worse had the Spa­niards, who net­ted via Al­varo Mo­rata, Ro­dri, Mikel Oyarz­a­bal and a tre­ble by Fer­ran Tor­res, not been waste­ful in front of goal, leav­ing Low and mid­fielder Toni Kroos shell-shocked.</p>
    <p>“We saw to­day that we are not as far down the road as we had hoped to be,” said Low.</p>
    <p>“After the first goal, we just gave up be­ing or­gan­ised. That was deadly. We charged out and just opened up all the spa­ces. We for­got about our game plan and just ran around out there.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally don’t know what hap­pened to the team. We had hardly</p>
    <p>any chances and we didn’t win a sin­gle in­di­vid­ual bat­tle out on the pitch. This has been a black day for us.”</p>
    <p>Kroos added: ‘This is def­i­nitely one of the worst de­feats of my ca­reer. It hurts.”</p>
    <p>With mount­ing crit­i­cism and his re­fusal to re­call Hum­mels, Boateng and Muller, Low has worked him­self in a cor­ner.</p>
    <p>Me­sut Ozil, who re­tired from in­ter­na­tional foot­ball after be­ing made the scape­goat for their World Cup exit, put the boot in, tweet­ing: “Time to take Jerome Boateng back.”</p>
    <p>Ger­man me­dia were equally scathing, with news mag­a­zine Der Spiegel calling it “a slap in the face”, while tele­vi­sion chan­nel Welt said the team “was not de</p>
    <p>feated, it was de­stroyed”.</p>
    <p>News­pa­per Bild also claimed that Low’s po­si­tion was now “wob­bling after the dis­as­ter”.</p>
    <p>But na­tional team di­rec­tor Oliver Bier­hoff in­sisted that there were no plans to sack him, even though he likened the ham­mer­ing to the way Brazil “fell apart” in the 7-1 drub­bing by Ger­many in 2014.</p>
    <p>Asked if the coach was safe un­til the post­poned Euro 2020, he told ARD TV: “Ab­so­lutely yes. This game changes noth­ing. We still trust Joachim Low, no doubt about that.”</p>
    <p>Ger­many will play again in March with a large pool of play­ers to chose from. But with­out a core of start­ing play­ers, the trans­for­ma­tion re­mains a work in progress.</p>
    <p>Low, how­ever, still feels he is the man to turn things around, point­ing to the absentees in Seville, in­clud­ing Joshua Kim­mich, Lukas Kloster­mann and Kai Havertz.</p>
    <p>“I have faith in my play­ers,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Now our re­spon­si­bil­ity is to ques­tion ev­ery­thing and ques­tion our­selves as well. We have to draw the right con­clu­sions.”</p>
