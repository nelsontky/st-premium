    <p>China looms large as the ele­phant in the room for the US al­lies in Asia – Ja­pan and South Korea – over their pre­ferred pick for US pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>A win for Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den might prom­ise a more col­lab­o­ra­tive and less trans­ac­tional re­la­tion­ship af­ter Pres­i­dent Donald Trump’s pro­cliv­ity for as­sail­ing al­lies for not im­port­ing more Amer­i­can prod­ucts and for not spend­ing enough on de­fence and on host­ing troops in their ter­ri­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Bu­reau­crats in Tokyo have pri­vately said they are com­forted b y Mr B i d e n ’ s p l e d g e to strengthen al­liances.</p>
    <p>Dr Ya­sushi Watan­abe, an ex­pert on US-Ja­pan ties at Keio Univer­sity, said he ex­pects less con­fronta­tion, but not nec­es­sar­ily less pres­sure, given that the Democrats have tra­di­tion­ally been more pro­tec­tion­ist than the Repub­li­cans.</p>
    <p>“There will still be pres­sure to buy Amer­i­can prod­ucts or relook cost-shar­ing ar­range­ments. This will not change.”</p>
    <p>What is more con­cern­ing, he said, is whether Mr Bi­den will be ef­fec­tive in deal­ing with China.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has, of late, been voic­ing in­creas­ing alarm at China’s mil­i­tary as­sertive­ness in the East and South China seas and on is­sues such as Hong Kong and a border flare-up with In­dia.</p>
    <p>Dr Watan­abe said: “He may be un­pre­dictable, but some peo­ple like Trump for his icon­o­clas­tic and very ag­gres­sive stance to­wards China.”</p>
    <p>Dr Lee Seong-hyon of South Korea’s Se­jong In­sti­tute think­tank noted sim­i­lar­i­ties be­tween the Demo­cratic and Repub­li­can plat­forms on China-re­lated is­sues, in­clud­ing Hong Kong and tech­no­log­i­cal com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“Many peo­ple have this flawed idea that ev­ery­thing will go back to the ‘nor­mal’ if Bi­den is elected,” he said.</p>
    <p>“With a new pres­i­dent, there will be a new style, but the sub­stance of US pol­icy to­wards China will more or less re­main the same. More­over, the over­all US pub­lic per­cep­tion of China is very neg­a­tive and so the Amer­i­can po­lit­i­cal elite will not di­verge from the pub­lic sen­ti­ment.”</p>
    <p>He added: “The real prob­lem is that it is not clear whether the Demo­cratic pres­i­dent has a bet­ter tool than Trump to re­strain China ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>“Putting the al­liance sys­tem back in or­der may take some time, given how much dam­age Trump did.”</p>
    <p>Bu­reau­crats in Tokyo have pri­vately said they are com­forted by Mr Joe Bi­den’s pledge to strengthen al­liances.</p>
