    <p>A man de­tained un­der the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity Act (ISA) af­ter he ac­tively spread rad­i­cal ide­ol­ogy on­line was charged in a district court yes­ter­day over a pass­port-re­lated mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Zul­fikar Mo­hamad Shar­iff, who used to hold dual ci­ti­zen­ship for Sin­ga­pore and Aus­tralia, is ac­cused of mak­ing a false state­ment when he ap­plied for a Sin­ga­pore pass­port in 2013.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) said he has since re­nounced his Sin­ga­pore ci­ti­zen­ship and ceased to be a cit­i­zen on Aug 26.</p>
    <p>The 49-year-old, who was rep­re­sented by lawyer Lock Zhi Yong, is ex­pected to plead guilty to the of­fence un­der the Pass­ports Act at his next court ap­pear­ance on Oct 22.</p>
    <p>Zul­fikar al­legedly made the false state­ment elec­tron­i­cally in the “Ap­pli­ca­tion for Pass­port On-line Elec­tronic Sys­tem” on Dec 11, 2013.</p>
    <p>He is said to have de­clared that he had not ac­quired the ci­ti­zen­ship of an­other coun­try when he ap­plied for the Sin­ga­pore pass­port.</p>
    <p>MHA said in its state­ment that Zul­fikar was ar­rested by the In­ter­nal Se­cu­rity De­part­ment (ISD) in Sin­ga­pore, and has been de­tained un­der the ISA since July 2016 for his ac­tive pro­mo­tion of ter­ror­ism and glo­ri­fi­ca­tion of the ter­ror­ist group Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria on­line.</p>
    <p>His ac­tions con­trib­uted to the rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion of at least two Sin­ga­pore­ans: Muham­mad Shamin Mo­hamed Sidek, who was de­tained un­der the ISA for ter­ror­ism-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties, and Mo­hamed Said­dhin Ab­dul­lah, whose Re­stric­tion Or­der was al­lowed to lapse on July 26.</p>
    <p>“Zul­fikar had also ex­horted Mus­lims to re­ject the con­sti­tu­tional, sec­u­lar, demo­cratic state in favour of the es­tab­lish­ment of an Is­lamic state gov­erned by syariah law. He be­lieved that vi­o­lence should be used to achieve this goal if nec­es­sary,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>It added that Zul­fikar had re­set­tled with his fam­ily in Aus­tralia in 2002.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing i nves­ti­ga­tions by ISD and the Im­mi­gra­tion and Check­points Author­ity (ICA), he ad­mit­ted that he had entered Sin­ga­pore us­ing his Sin­ga­pore pass­port and with­held in­for­ma­tion re­gard­ing his Aus­tralian ci­ti­zen­ship.</p>
    <p>“He also ad­mit­ted to hav­ing falsely de­clared to the ICA that he did not hold the ci­ti­zen­ship of an­other coun­try when he ap­plied to re­new his Sin­ga­pore pass­port in 2013, as he did not want to give up ei­ther ci­ti­zen­ship,” said MHA.</p>
    <p>If convicted of the of­fence un­der the Pass­ports Act, Zul­fikar can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to $10,000.</p>
