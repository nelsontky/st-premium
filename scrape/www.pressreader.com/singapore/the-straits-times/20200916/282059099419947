    <p>Tech has sud­denly be­come a defin­ing is­sue for the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment. A US$40 bil­lion (S$54.4 bil­lion) deal for Cam­bridge-based chip de­signer Arm comes as tech­nol­ogy pol­icy has cre­ated an ob­struc­tion in Brexit ne­go­ti­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment that hailed Arm’s first sale in 2016 as a sign of Britain’s post-Brexit al­lure has come a long way. Britain’s trade talks with the Euro­pean Union (EU) – and pos­si­bly a fu­ture trade deal with the United States – are poised on a knife’s edge.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son and his chief ad­viser, Brexit campaign mas­ter­mind Do­minic Cum­mings, be­lieve EU rules gov­ern­ing sub­si­dies and other state aid to in­dus­try get in the way of post-Brexit Britain be­com­ing a sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy pow­er­house.</p>
    <p>They are threat­en­ing to walk away from the trade talks, and to break Bri­tish treaty com­mit­ments, to avoid the EU’s rules.</p>
    <p>On one level, this seems an odd fight to pick. It’s not that Britain lacks in­no­va­tion – as the spin-off of Arm from the now-de­funct Bri­tish com­put­ing com­pany Acorn shows.</p>
    <p>START-UP SCENE</p>
    <p>On the con­trary, Britain has a thriv­ing start-up scene – at least by Euro­pean stan­dards. By the end of last year, it had 77 start-ups val­ued at more than US$1 bil­lion, more than twice as many as Ger­many, the next big­gest, ac­cord­ing to Deal­room, a data provider.</p>
    <p>Nor can it be said that Bri­tish start-ups are starved of cap­i­tal. The US$13 bil­lion in ven­ture fund­ing se­cured by Bri­tish firms last year was more than that won by French and</p>
    <p>Ger­man start-ups com­bined.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment also pro­vides tax cred­its and in­vest­ments to spur in­no­va­tion and start-ups.</p>
    <p>But you can see the con­cern. The coun­try that in­vented graphene has strug­gled to com­mer­cialise its in­no­va­tions and hold on to com­pa­nies once they reach a cer­tain size.</p>
    <p>Arm, ac­quired by Ja­pan’s Softbank and now by US chip­maker Nvidia, isn’t alone. Ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence firm Deep­Mind was bought by Google.</p>
    <p>Those losses, as well as Bri­tish de­pen­dence on Chi­nese mo­bile com­pany Huawei’s 5G tech­nol­ogy, seem to be what has prompted the focus on build­ing bet­ter state sup­port for the coun­try’s tech sec­tor.</p>
    <p>RE­SEARCH FUND­ING</p>
    <p>One long­stand­ing prob­lem is that Britain un­der­funds re­search com­pared to its ma­jor trad­ing part­ners.</p>
    <p>The £37.1 bil­lion (S$65 bil­lion) it cu­mu­la­tively spent on re­search and de­vel­op­ment (R&D) in 2018 rep­re­sented just 1.7 per cent of the coun­try’s gross domestic prod­uct (GDP) – less than both the 3.1 per cent spent by Ger­many and the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment av­er­age of 2.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>Google par­ent Al­pha­bet alone spent US$27 bil­lion on R&D in the 12 months to the end of June.</p>
    <p>But the EU state aid regime isn’t to blame. The vast ma­jor­ity of state aid is al­lowed au­to­mat­i­cally. Rather, Britain has gen­er­ally cho­sen to pro­vide less aid than other mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Last year, for ex­am­ple, Britain spent far less on sub­si­dies to com­pa­nies (0.34 per cent of GDP) than Ger­many (at least 1.45 per cent) and France (0.79 per cent) did.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion ap­proved a plan to give €1.8 bil­lion (S$2.9 bil­lion) of pub­lic fund­ing to the semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try, whose R&D costs are the high­est in tech.</p>
    <p>France com­mit­ted to contributi­ng as much as €355 mil­lion to help its chip com­pa­nies, Italy chucked in €524 mil­lion and Ger­many gave €820 mil­lion. All have chip­mak­ing giants, from Franco-Ital­ian ST­Mi­cro­elec­tron­ics to In­fi­neon and Robert Bosch in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Britain sought per­mis­sion for just €48 mil­lion, yet still hasn’t paid any of it. That’s partly be­cause it has tended to in­vest up­stream, par­tic­u­larly in aca­demic re­search, leav­ing far fewer funds avail­able to help in­no­va­tive com­pa­nies trans­late their ideas into prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>A re­vised state aid pol­icy could pro­vide R&D cash cred­its to foster tech­nol­ogy clus­ters and help them move to­wards com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that, done well, gov­ern­ments can make a huge dif­fer­ence in the de­vel­op­ment of a vi­brant tech­nol­ogy sec­tor; Sin­ga­pore, Tai­wan and Is­rael are good ex­am­ples of this.</p>
    <p>PROB­LEM WITH PICK­ING WIN­NERS</p>
    <p>And yet, the idea of an ex­pan­sive, new pol­icy strat­egy for the tech sec­tor makes many Con­ser­va­tives ner­vous, not least be­cause pick­ing win­ners is risky.</p>
    <p>“France, Ja­pan and China have done a bet­ter job than we have over the years,” said strat­egy and en­trepreneur­ship pro­fes­sor Ju­lian Birkin­shaw of the Lon­don Busi­ness School. “But they’ve also had more fail­ures than they’ve had suc­cesses.”</p>
    <p>Even so, in­vest­ing in later-stage ven­tures is of­ten a safer bet than the scat­ter­gun aca­demic ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment fund­ing can be an ac­cel­er­a­tor, but it has to come at the right junc­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Alok Sharma, Mr John­son’s sec­re­tary of state for busi­ness, en­ergy and in­dus­trial strat­egy, in­sists the gov­ern­ment’s in­ten­tions are not to re­turn to the failed in­dus­trial poli­cies of the 1970s. But the gov­ern­ment hasn’t yet pub­lished its new state aid pro­gramme. Mr Cum­mings says he wants to fund only the best projects and sec­tors.</p>
    <p>But politics may muddy the pic­ture. Mr John­son’s big gov­ern­ing vi­sion is to re­bal­ance the econ­omy to pro­vide jobs and op­por­tu­nity in the north of the coun­try, where many of his new vot­ers live. It’s hard to imag­ine that state aid de­ci­sions will not in part be gov­erned by keep­ing these vot­ers happy.</p>
    <p>Many of the gov­ern­ment’s tech in­vest­ments have al­ready raised eye­brows. For ex­am­ple, ear­lier this year, it took a 45 per cent stake in bank­rupt satel­lite com­pany OneWeb, ar­gu­ing the pur­chase would help fill the gap left by the Bri­tish los­ing ac­cess to the EU’s Galileo nav­i­ga­tion satel­lite sys­tem and also help domestic broad­band.</p>
    <p>But the in­vest­ment was rushed through with lit­tle scru­tiny and over the reser­va­tions of in­ter­nal ex­perts.</p>
    <p>In some ways, the gov­ern­ment’s failed foray into de­vel­op­ing its own Covid-19 con­tact-trac­ing app, in­stead of us­ing the joint Google-Ap­ple ap­proach adopted else­where in Europe, re­flects the hubris that could get it into trou­ble as it sets out to nur­ture a Bri­tish Google.</p>
    <p>THE MINITEL MIND­SET</p>
    <p>It’s a mind­set that has been aptly called the “Minitel il­lu­sion”. Minitel, re­call, was the 1980s French ter­mi­nal backed by the state as an al­ter­na­tive to the US-de­vel­oped In­ter­net, but fi­nally re­tired in 2012. It was a bril­liant in­ven­tion for its time, but the high-cost ter­mi­nals could not com­pete with the mul­ti­task­ing per­sonal com­puter, and it had lit­tle use­ful­ness out­side France.</p>
    <p>The French gov­ern­ment, with fi­nan­cial back­ing from the EU and tech­ni­cal sup­port from Ger­many, also tried to cre­ate a lit­eral com­peti­tor to Google, dubbed Quaero, from the Latin for “I seek”, in 2008. It ended in 2013.</p>
    <p>Pick­ing win­ners is prob­lem­atic, but so is fo­cus­ing R&D fund­ing so heav­ily on the univer­sity sec­tor. Help­ing later-stage cor­po­rate re­search may split the dif­fer­ence ef­fec­tively for Britain.</p>
    <p>But apart from the dan­ger of re­peat­ing the er­rors of the past, Britain could pay a high price, in terms of mar­ket ac­cess, for Mr John­son’s de­ter­mi­na­tion that it should have an in­de­pen­dent state aid pol­icy.</p>
    <p>As for Arm, its re­sale stands as a sign of both the in­ge­nu­ity of Britain’s tech sec­tor as well as lim­i­ta­tions that have noth­ing to do with Britain’s EU mem­ber­ship.</p>
    <p>Arm co-founder and ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist Her­mann Hauser has ar­gued that the sale to Nvidia will result in job losses in Britain and com­pro­mise the coun­try’s “tech­nol­ogy sovereignt­y”.</p>
    <p>It’s an in­ter­est­ing con­cept, and one with in­nate ap­peal to the eco­nomic na­tion­al­ism of Mr John­son’s Con­ser­va­tives.</p>
    <p>But ul­ti­mately, tech­no­log­i­cal sovereignt­y, if it ex­ists at all, can­not be de­creed. It must be built.</p>
