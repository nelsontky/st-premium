    <p>There were five new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, all of them im­ported.</p>
    <p>Those in­fected had been placed on stay-home no­tice on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>There were no new lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases, for the eighth day in a row.</p>
    <p>The new im­ported cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,135.</p>
    <p>Three of the five are work per­mit hold­ers, and the oth­ers are a stu­dent’s pass holder and a short­term visit pass holder.</p>
    <p>The work per­mit hold­ers, who are em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, had trav­elled from Myan­mar. The stu­dent’s pass holder ar­rived from In­dia, while the short-term visit pass holder came from Bangladesh. All were asymp­to­matic when tested.</p>
    <p>MOH said all close con­tacts of the im­ported cases have been iso­lated and they will be tested at the start and end of their quar­an­tine pe­riod to de­tect asymp­to­matic cases.</p>
    <p>No new clus­ters and no new lo­ca­tions vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MOH said the dor­mi­tory clus­ter at Aspri-Westlite Pa­pan has been closed, with no new cases linked to it for 28 days, or two in­cu­ba­tion pe­ri­ods.</p>
    <p>With seven cases discharged yes­ter­day, 58,031 pa­tients have re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>There were 33 pa­tients still in hos­pi­tal, and 28 in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None was in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, and 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break that be­gan last De­cem­ber has in­fected more than 55.4 mil­lion peo­ple. Over 1.33 mil­lion peo­ple have died.</p>
