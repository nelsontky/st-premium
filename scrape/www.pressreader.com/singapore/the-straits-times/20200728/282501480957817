    <p>Hong Kong ac­tress Elaine Ng has hit back at a claim that ac­tion star Jackie Chan gave her a sum of money af­ter she gave birth to their love child in 1999.</p>
    <p>Ng, 46, made head­lines that year when she dis­closed that she was preg­nant with Chan’s child and gave birth to daugh­ter Etta later the same year.</p>
    <p>Chan, 66, has been mar­ried to former ac­tress Joan Lin, 67, since 1982, and the cou­ple have a 37-year-old son, ac­tor Jaycee Chan.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent re­port cir­cu­lated on the Chi­nese In­ter­net, a se­nior re­porter from Hong Kong claimed that movie mogul Al­bert Ye­ung gave HK$40 mil­lion to Chan in 1999 to help him set­tle the mat­ter with Ng af­ter Etta was born.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Ng took to Weibo to rubbish the re­port. She wrote in Chi­nese: “There are many types of peo­ple in this world. No mat­ter whether it is 20 mil­lion, 30 mil­lion or 40 mil­lion, if you are happy say­ing it, then it is also a bless­ing to make other peo­ple happy.”</p>
    <p>She hinted fur­ther that she did not take any money when she said peo­ple should be­ware of “ver­bal karma”.</p>
    <p>There have been ru­mours in the past that Chan had been sup­port­ing Ng se­cretly af­ter she moved to Shang­hai with Etta, but Ng de­nied this in 2017, say­ing Chan had not pro­vided her with liv­ing ex­penses.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress, fa­mous for roles in TVB se­ri­als such as Old Time Buddy – To Catch A Thief (1998) and Le­gal En­tan­gle­ment (2002), has of­ten been in the news for her ac­ri­mo­nious re­la­tion­ship with Etta.</p>
    <p>She said last year that progress has been made in her re­la­tion­ship with her daugh­ter as they are more aware of each other’s bound­aries and know which top­ics to avoid when they speak to each other.</p>
