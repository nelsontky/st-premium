    <p>ZURICH/FRANK­FURT • At least four drug­mak­ers ex­pect their Covid-19 vac­cines to be ef­fec­tive against the new fast-spread­ing vari­ant of the virus that is rag­ing in Bri­tain and are per­form­ing tests that should pro­vide con­fir­ma­tion in a few weeks.</p>
    <p>Dr Ugur Sahin, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Ger­many’s BioNTech which, with its part­ner Pfizer, took less than a year to get a vac­cine ap­proved, said on Tues­day that he ex­pects its mes­sen­ger RNA (mRNA) vac­cine to still work well.</p>
    <p>Moderna, Ger­many’s CureVac and Bri­tish drug­maker As­traZeneca also be­lieve their shots will work against the new threat that has sown chaos in Bri­tain, prompt­ing a wave of travel bans that are dis­rupt­ing trade with Europe and threat­en­ing to fur­ther iso­late the is­land coun­try.</p>
    <p>“Sci­en­tif­i­cally, it is highly likely that the im­mune re­sponse by this vac­cine can also deal with this virus vari­ant,” Dr Sahin said on a call with re­porters.</p>
    <p>He said it will take an­other two weeks or so of study and data col­lec­tion to get a de­fin­i­tive an­swer.</p>
    <p>“The vac­cine con­tains more than 1,270 amino acids, and only nine of them are changed (in the mu­tated virus). That means that 99 per cent of the pro­tein is still the same.”</p>
    <p>The mu­ta­tion known as the B.1.1.7 lineage may be up to 70 per cent more in­fec­tious and more of a con­cern for chil­dren.</p>
    <p>In the event that the vari­ant presents vac­cine devel­op­ers with an un­ex­pected chal­lenge, an ad­van­tage of mRNA is that sci­en­tists can quickly re-en­gi­neer ge­netic ma­te­rial in the shot to match that of the mu­tated pro­tein, whereas mod­i­fy­ing tra­di­tional vac­cines would re­quire ex­tra steps.</p>
    <p>“In prin­ci­ple, the beauty of the mRNA tech­nol­ogy is we can di­rectly start to en­gi­neer a vac­cine which com­pletely mim­ics this new mu­ta­tion,” Dr Sahin said.</p>
    <p>“We could be able to pro­vide a new vac­cine tech­ni­cally within six weeks. Of course, this is not only a tech­ni­cal ques­tion. We have to deal with how reg­u­la­tors... would see that.”</p>
    <p>Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and CureVac all de­vel­oped mRNA vac­cines, while As­traZeneca has a more tra­di­tional vac­cine that uses an ade­n­ovirus found i n chim­panzees to de­liver ge­netic ma­te­rial from the coro­n­avirus to spur an im­mune re­sponse.</p>
    <p>CureVac started late-stage clin­i­cal tri­als on its vac­cine can­di­date last week and is con­stantly re­view­ing vari­ants, which the com­pany said are com­mon as viruses spread.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s chief sci­en­tific ad­viser Pa­trick Val­lance said last Satur­day that vac­cines ap­peared to be ad­e­quate in gen­er­at­ing an im­mune re­sponse to the vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>In­oc­u­la­tions have be­gun i n Bri­tain and the United States, with ship­ments also go­ing to Canada, Is­rael and Mex­ico.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union coun­tries have said shots will start days af­ter Christ­mas, while Switzer­land and Qatar au­tho­rised the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine at the week­end.</p>
    <p>Even so, Dr Sahin pre­dicted that the “new nor­mal” would see so­ci­ety deal­ing with spo­radic Covid-19 out­breaks for the next decade, with mul­ti­ple vac­cines help­ing to avoid busi­ness shut­downs and over­loaded hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>“This win­ter, we will not have an im­pact on the in­fec­tion num­bers, but we must have an im­pact so that the next win­ter will be the new nor­mal,” he said.</p>
    <p>More than 100 other vac­cine can­di­dates are in the works, with trial data on sev­eral ex­pected soon.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine ex­perts say mul­ti­ple shots will be needed to pro­vide enough doses to in­oc­u­late the world, from rich to poor.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Fed­er­a­tion of Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Man­u­fac­tur­ers and As­so­ci­a­tions ex­pects up to 10 vac­cines to have won ap­proval by the mid­dle of next year, in­clud­ing those from CureVac and US com­pa­nies Johnson & Johnson and No­vavax.</p>
    <p>Yet, huge chal­lenges re­main, in­clud­ing ramp­ing up production.</p>
    <p>Pfizer ex­pects to pro­duce just 50 mil­lion shots for this year, half its orig­i­nal goal, cov­er­ing 25 mil­lion peo­ple with its two-dose reg­i­men.</p>
    <p>Moderna has pledged 20 mil­lion US in­oc­u­la­tions this year, cov­er­ing 10 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing will ac­cel­er­ate next year, with com­bined production po­ten­tially top­ping 1.8 bil­lion doses.</p>
    <p>Other com­pa­nies’ tra­jec­to­ries are sim­i­lar, but sup­plies will not come fast enough for a world hun­gry for vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“There just aren’t go­ing to be enough vac­cines to go around for a long time... maybe well into 2022,” said Dr Tom Frieden, for­mer di­rec­tor of the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion.</p>
    <p>TACK­LING NEW STRAIN</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tif­i­cally, it is highly likely that the im­mune re­sponse by this vac­cine can also deal with this virus vari­ant... The vac­cine con­tains more than 1,270 amino acids, and only nine of them are changed (in the mu­tated virus). That means that 99 per cent of the pro­tein is still the same.</p>

    <p>There just aren’t go­ing to be enough vac­cines to go around for a long time... maybe well into 2022.</p>
