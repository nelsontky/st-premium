    <p>• The US Centres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion (CDC) has asked state pub­lic health of­fi­cials to pre­pare to dis­trib­ute a po­ten­tial coro­n­avirus vac­cine to high-risk groups as soon as late Oc­to­ber, doc­u­ments pub­lished by the agency showed on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The tim­ing of a vac­cine has taken on po­lit­i­cal im­por­tance as US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump seeks re-elec­tion in Novem­ber, af­ter com­mit­ting bil­lions of fed­eral dol­lars to de­velop a vac­cine to pre­vent Covid-19, which has killed more than 190,000 Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>“For the pur­pose of ini­tial plan­ning, CDC pro­vided states with cer­tain plan­ning as­sump­tions as they work on state spe­cific plans for vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion, in­clud­ing pos­si­bly hav­ing lim­ited quan­ti­ties of vac­cines in Oc­to­ber and Novem­ber,” a CDC spokesman told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The New York Times had ear­lier re­ported that the CDC had con­tacted of­fi­cials in all 50 states and five large cities with the plan­ning in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert An­thony Fauci ear­lier on Wed­nes­day said on MSNBC that based on the pa­tient en­rol­ment rate in Covid-19 vac­cine tri­als un­der way, there could be enough clin­i­cal data to know by Novem­ber or De­cem­ber that one of the vac­cines is safe and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>The vac­cines would be made avail­able free of cost first to high­risk groups, in­clud­ing health­care work­ers, na­tional se­cu­rity per­son­nel, and nurs­ing home res­i­dents and staff, the agency said in the doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors around the world have re­peat­edly said de­vel­op­ment speed will not com­pro­mise vac­cine safety, as quicker re­sults would stem from con­duct­ing par­al­lel tri­als that are usu­ally done in se­quence. But such re­as­sur­ances have not con­vinced ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary re­sults of a sur­vey con­ducted over the last three months in 19 coun­tries showed that only about 70 per cent of Bri­tish and US re­spon­dents would take a Covid-19 vac­cine if avail­able, Dr Scott Ratzan, co-leader of a group called Busi­ness Part­ners to Con­vince, told Reuters last month.</p>
    <p>Drug de­vel­op­ers are lead­ing the race to de­velop a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine for the res­pi­ra­tory ill­ness. The CDC doc­u­ments de­scribe two vac­cine can­di­dates that must be stored at tem­per­a­tures of mi­nus 70 and mi­nus 20 deg C. Those stor­age re­quire­ments match pro­files of can­di­dates from Pfizer and Moderna.</p>
    <p>CDC di­rec­tor Robert Red­field has asked state gov­er­nors to ex­pe­dite McKesson Corp’s re­quests for build­ing vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion centres and to con­sider waiv­ing re­quire­ments that would stop them from be­com­ing fully op­er­a­tional by Nov 1, ac­cord­ing to a re­cent letter ob­tained by Reuters.</p>
