    <p>•</p>
    <p>DOU­GLAS (Ari­zona) Four years ago, United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump took of­fice with a pledge to build a tow­er­ing wall on Amer­ica’s bor­der with Mex­ico – a sym­bol of his de­ter­mi­na­tion to halt im­mi­gra­tion from coun­tries to the south and build a bar­rier that would long out­last him.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has said he hopes to halt con­struc­tion of the bor­der wall, but the out­go­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion is rush­ing to com­plete as much of the wall as pos­si­ble in its last weeks in power, dy­na­mit­ing through some of the bor­der’s most for­bid­ding ter­rain.</p>
    <p>The break­neck pace at which con­struc­tion is con­tin­u­ing all but as­sures that the wall, what­ever Mr Bi­den de­cides to do, is here to stay for the fore­see­able fu­ture, es­tab­lish­ing a con­tentious legacy for Mr Trump in places that were cru­cial to his de­feat.</p>
    <p>In south-eastern Ari­zona, the con­tin­u­ing po­lit­i­cal di­vi­sive­ness</p>
    <p>around the Pres­i­dent’s sig­na­ture con­struc­tion project has pit­ted rancher against rancher and neigh</p>
    <p>bour against neigh­bour in a state that a Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date nar­rowly car­ried for the first time in decades.</p>
    <p>The re­gion is emerg­ing as one of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s last cen­tres of wall-build­ing as blast­ing crews tear through the re­mote Pel­on­cillo Moun­tains, where ocelots and bighorn sheep roam through wood­lands of cot­ton­woods and sycamores.</p>
    <p>While the Pres­i­dent-elect has said he will halt new wall con­struc­tion, other im­mi­gra­tion pri­or­i­ties – like end­ing travel bans, ac­cept­ing more refugees and eas­ing asy­lum re­stric­tions – are eclips­ing calls to tear down por­tions of the wall that al­ready ex­ist, with one ad­viser call­ing the wall a “dis­trac­tion”.</p>
    <p>Cus­toms and Bor­der Pro­tec­tion of­fi­cials are still rush­ing to meet Mr Trump’s man­date of 724.2km of new wall con­struc­tion dur­ing his term, nearly dou­bling the rate of con­struc­tion since the start of the year.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tion had built 647km of wall as at Nov 13. Of that, about 40km had no bar­rier be­fore Mr Trump took of­fice.</p>
    <p>The rest re­placed much smaller, di­lap­i­dated sec­tions of the wall, or sec­tions that had only ve­hi­cle bar­ri­ers, which bor­der of­fi­cials say did not de­ter mi­grants cross­ing on foot.</p>
