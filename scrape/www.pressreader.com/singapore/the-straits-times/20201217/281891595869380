    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Google’s cloud-hosted e-mail ser­vice suf­fered a “sig­nif­i­cant” dis­rup­tion on Tues­day again, just a day af­ter it went down dur­ing a mas­sive out­age of the In­ter­net gi­ant’s plat­form.</p>
    <p>Google said on a sta­tus dash­board that it had Gmail op­er­a­tions back in or­der shortly be­fore 0000 GMT, about 21/ hours af­ter peo</p>
    <p>2 ple started com­plain­ing of prob­lems.</p>
    <p>“We apol­o­gise for the in­con­ve­nience and thank you for your pa­tience and con­tin­ued sup­port,” Google said in the sta­tus dash­board no­tice. “Please rest as­sured that sys­tem re­li­a­bil­ity is a top pri­or­ity at Google, and we are mak­ing con­tin­u­ous im­prove­ments to make our sys­tems bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>The ser­vice out­age came as Net­flix’s video stream­ing ser­vices went down for more than 1,000 users on Tues­day, ac­cord­ing to the out­age track­ing web­site Down­de­tec­tor.com.</p>
    <p>Down­de­tec­tor.com showed there were nearly 1,300 in­ci­dents of peo­ple re­port­ing is­sues with the video stream­ing ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Google did not dis­close the num­ber of users af­fected or the pre­cise cause of the trou­ble.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem with Gmail af­fected “a sig­nif­i­cant sub­set of users”, the com­pany said in a post.</p>
    <p>Gmail users en­coun­tered er­ror mes­sages, high la­tency and other un­usual be­hav­iour at the ser­vice, ac­cord­ing to Google.</p>
    <p>A mas­sive blackout on Mon­day tem­po­rar­ily dis­rupted pop­u­lar Google ser­vices such as Gmail and video-shar­ing plat­form YouTube, de­rail­ing the re­mote learn­ing, work and en­ter­tain­ment that peo­ple have come to rely on dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>About 17,000 peo­ple re­ported Gmail ser­vice prob­lems at a peak point at about 2.30pm in Cal­i­for­nia, where Google has its head­quar­ters, ac­cord­ing to Down­de­tec­tor.</p>
    <p>Other Google ser­vices such as YouTube, Maps and search ap­peared to be op­er­at­ing nor­mally.</p>
    <p>The broad out­age on Mon­day lasted about 45 min­utes. Ser­vices that re­quire users to log into ac­counts, such as YouTube or Gmail, had “higher er­ror rates” than usual, re­sult­ing in peo­ple be­ing de­nied ac­cess, Google said of the Mon­day out­age.</p>
    <p>Google in­di­cated on its dash­board dur­ing that out­age that it in­volved ser­vices for “the ma­jor­ity of users”. Al­ready ubiq­ui­tous, on­line ser­vices have be­come even more crit­i­cal this year amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, as mil­lions work from home and stu­dents take their classes on­line.</p>
