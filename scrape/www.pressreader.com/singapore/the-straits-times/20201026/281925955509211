    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Cal­i­for­ni­ans are fac­ing the largest mass black­out so far this year as the state’s big­gest util­ity, PG&E, pre­pares power shut­offs to pre­vent live wires from fall­ing into dry brush and ig­nit­ing wild­fires, with fe­ro­cious winds ex­pected to sweep across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>PG&E was plan­ning to cut power to 386,000 homes and busi­nesses – af­fect­ing an es­ti­mated 1.2 mil­lion peo­ple – across North­ern Cal­i­for­nia start­ing at 10am yes­ter­day, com­pany of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>That was down from an ini­tial pro­jec­tion of about 466,000 cus­tomers given last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The out­ages are poised to hit 38 coun­ties that in­clude the San Fran­cisco Bay area, the Sierra Nevada foothills, the Cen­tral Val­ley and the Cen­tral Coast. A fi­nal de­ci­sion on the black­out was to be made yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>“This event looks par­tic­u­larly dan­ger­ous due to a com­bi­na­tion of fac­tors that we con­tinue to track,” said Mr Scott Stren­fel, PG&E’s head of me­te­o­rol­ogy and fire sci­ence.</p>
    <p>Bone dry air was set to ac­com­pany the strong winds that were pre­dicted to pick up through­out the day yes­ter­day, he said.</p>
    <p>Edi­son Internatio­nal’s South­ern Cal­i­for­nia Edi­son util­ity said 56,500 cus­tomers could lose power – af­fect­ing about 170,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The power cuts could be­gin this morn­ing for res­i­dents in moun­tain­ous areas around Los An­ge­les where dry Santa Ana winds will blow, a spokesman said by phone.</p>
    <p>The po­ten­tial black­outs would be the lat­est blow for a state that has been bat­tered by ex­treme weather and has al­ready seen a record 1.66 mil­lion ha scorched this year.</p>
    <p>PG&E has pre­emp­tively cut power four times this year to pre­vent fall­ing wires from i gnit­ing blazes in a re­gion that is tin­der dry from heat and drought. The new round of out­ages would be the big­gest by far, stretch­ing across much of PG&E’s ser­vice ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Winds start­ing this past week­end were fore­cast to reach 113kmh in the north­ern part of the state, with gusts ex­pected to last un­til to­mor­row morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Hu­mid­ity could be as low as 6 per cent in Red­ding and just 5 per cent in Grass Val­ley, ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Weather Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>It comes as the state is al­ready rid­dled with dry brush and grasses due to the hottest av­er­age tem­per­a­tures over the past six months, ac­cord­ing to records that go back 126 years, said Mr Stren­fel of PG&E.</p>
    <p>The black­outs may hit densely pop­u­lated parts of the San Fran­cisco met­ro­pol­i­tan area, in­clud­ing por­tions of Oakland, Berke­ley and Marin County – cut­ting power to many res­i­dents as they are work­ing from home due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The city of Berke­ley ad­vised res­i­dents liv­ing in the hills to evac­u­ate due to the fire risk.</p>
    <p>San Fran­cisco, at rel­a­tively low risk of fires, is the only county in the Bay Area re­gion not ex­pected to be af­fected.</p>
    <p>PG&E and South­ern Cal­i­for­nia Edi­son are not the only util­i­ties warn­ing of out­ages. Pa­cific Power, owned by Mr War­ren Buf­fett’s Berk­shire Hath­away, last Fri­day said it could switch off power for about 5,800 cus­tomers in North­ern Cal­i­for­nia and South­ern Ore­gon yes­ter­day due to the gusts.</p>
    <p>Much of the United States’ west coast is at risk from wild­fires as dry weather and stiff winds com­bine to turn hill­sides, forests and scrub land into tin­der­boxes.</p>
    <p>In Colorado, two of the largest fires in state his­tory have forced the clo­sure of Rocky Moun­tain Na­tional Park and trig­gered the evac­u­a­tion of nearby towns.</p>
    <p>More than eight mil­lion peo­ple across Cal­i­for­nia will be in high-risk zones, in­clud­ing the cities of Sacra­mento, Stock­ton and San Bernardino, ac­cord­ing to the US Storm Pre­dic­tion Cen­tre in its long-range fore­cast.</p>
    <p>The loom­ing out­ages come on the heels of a blis­ter­ing heat­wave that gripped Cal­i­for­nia ear­lier this month, driv­ing tem­per­a­tures to record daily highs.</p>
    <p>PG&E be­gan re­sort­ing to pre­ven­ta­tive shut-offs af­ter its equip­ment caused some of Cal­i­for­nia’s worst blazes, forc­ing the com­pany into bank­ruptcy last year. It emerged from Chap­ter 11 in July, af­ter hav­ing paid US$25.5 bil­lion (S$34.6 bil­lion) to re­solve fire claims.</p>
