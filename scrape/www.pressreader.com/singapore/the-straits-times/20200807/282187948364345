    <p>Co-work­ing space op­er­a­tor JustCo will be open­ing two new cen­tres – at OCBC Cen­tre East this month and at The Cen­tre­point in Oc­to­ber – it said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among the ten­ants will be cos­met­ics gi­ant L’Oreal, food de­liv­ery firm Food­panda, and Ten­cent­backed video game de­vel­oper Riot Games, which will to­gether de­ploy a to­tal of about 300 work­ers at the new of­fices.</p>
    <p>The two cen­tres have a com­bined ca­pac­ity of 2,000 users.</p>
    <p>Mr Bran­don Chia, JustCo’s vi­cepres­i­dent and head for Sin­ga­pore and In­done­sia, told The Straits Times that the open­ing of the two workspaces were de­layed by two to three months due to the Covid-19 out­break and the cir­cuit breaker, dur­ing which most peo­ple were re­quired to work from home.</p>
    <p>New flex­i­ble workspace con­cepts, such as an on-de­mand model where users pay only for the ameni­ties they use, will be pi­loted at JustCo’s of­fice at The Cen­tre­point, which is in­tended as a smart cowork­ing cen­tre.</p>
    <p>JustCo, which is backed by sov­er­eign wealth fund GIC and real estate firm Frasers Prop­erty, will have 19 cen­tres in Sin­ga­pore fol­low­ing the ad­di­tion of the two new workspaces.</p>
    <p>It is re­lo­cat­ing its head­quar­ters from Ma­rina One East Tower to The Cen­tre­point to cater for the com­pany’s growth and ex­pan­sion, said Mr Chia.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve the new of­fice will boost the col­lab­o­ra­tion spirit and staff morale as we tran­sit into a new era.”</p>
    <p>L’Oreal, head­quar­tered in France, will be hous­ing its Asia-Pa­cific travel re­tail em­ploy­ees at the OCBC Cen­tre East workspace to ac­com­mo­date its grow­ing team in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The cos­metic firm’s work­ers can work from any JustCo cen­tre in the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>JustCo will have 42 cen­tres across the re­gion by the end of the year, in cities such as Bangkok, Jakarta, Mel­bourne and Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>Mr Luc An­dreani, man­ag­ing direc­tor of Food­panda Sin­ga­pore, said: “JustCo workspaces have been great in meet­ing our team’s grow­ing head­count, by al­low­ing us to move into ad­di­tional workspaces as and when the busi­ness re­quires.”</p>
    <p>The food de­liv­ery firm also oc­cu­pies a unit at JustCo’s Cross Street cen­tre, in ad­di­tion to its own head­quar­ters in Ce­cil Street.</p>
