    <p>In the Hong Kong drama Suk Suk (R21, 92 min­utes), two older men are seen hav­ing drinks in a cafe, shop­ping at the wet mar­ket and sit­ting on a park bench.</p>
    <p>The “un­cles” – the ti­tle means un­cle in Can­tonese – ap­pear to be an or­di­nary pair of se­niors one sees ev­ery­where. They are lovers.</p>
    <p>Writer-direc­tor Ray Ye­ung tells The Straits Times in an e-mail in­ter­view that he al­ways wanted Suk Suk’s cen­tral ro­mance to be be­tween two older peo­ple – an un­pop­u­lar artis­tic choice, given that view­ers pre­fer to see young, at­trac­tive per­sons on screen.</p>
    <p>Ye­ung’s film shows Pak (played by Tai Bo) and Hoi (Ben Yuen), two men well into their 60s, do­ing things lovers do.</p>
    <p>Taxi driver Pak lives in fear of his wife and child dis­cov­er­ing his dou­ble life while Hoi, a di­vorced man who lives with less anx­i­ety, has to re­spect Pak’s bound­aries.</p>
    <p>Fudg­ing the vi­su­als to make the film more palat­able, as film-mak­ers some­times do with char­ac­ters past 50, such as by us­ing flash­backs, was out of the ques­tion.</p>
    <p>“The aim of the film is to show the ex­pe­ri­ences of th­ese men in their twilight years. If I had used flash­backs or younger ac­tors to play them, I don’t think it would truly re­flect their strug­gles,” he says.</p>
    <p>The Can­tonese-lan­guage Suk Suk, Ye­ung’s third fea­ture, will be screened this month as part of the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Film Fes­ti­val 2020. It scored five nom­i­na­tions in the 2019 Golden Horse Awards, in­clud­ing Lead Ac­tor (for Yuen and Tai).</p>
    <p>At this year’s Hong Kong Film Awards, Tai picked up Best Ac­tor while Pa­tra Au, who plays his wife Ching, won Best Sup­port­ing Ac­tress. At the same event, the film also earned a Best Pic­ture nom­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Ye­ung says that when men of a cer­tain age fall in love, they face prob­lems re­lated to how they had to blend into the main­stream while grow­ing up.</p>
    <p>“They were liv­ing in an era when ho­mo­sex­u­al­ity was il­le­gal and al­most ev­ery­one had to get mar­ried. An un­mar­ried man of a cer­tain age was seen as an out­cast and this would af­fect his sta­tus at work, within the fam­ily and so­ci­ety at large,” says Ye­ung, whose pre­vi­ous films, Front Cover (2015) and Cut Sleeve Boys (2006), also ex­plored gay themes.</p>
    <p>Ching, Pak’s wife, is trapped in a love­less mar­riage.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese women are mar­ried to some­one who doesn’t de­sire them. The foun­da­tion of their re­la­tion­ship is based on a lie. They suf­fer, of­ten in si­lence, won­der­ing why their hus­bands are not at­tracted to them sex­u­ally. If they find out the truth, it would be dev­as­tat­ing,” he says.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with a decade ago, it is eas­ier to­day to get a film such as Suk Suk made, says Ye­ung, though he did face some dif­fi­cul­ties ob­tain­ing fund­ing and in cast­ing ac­tors.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, he found Tai and Yuen – ac­tors with decades of ex­pe­ri­ence in films and tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>With play­ing gay char­ac­ters less of a taboo now, Ye­ung be­lieves that the de­pic­tion of such per­sons on tele­vi­sion and in f i l ms h a s im­proved over time, com­pared with sev­eral years ago, when in films such as Stephen Chow’s Kung Fu Hus­tle (2004), an ef­fem­i­nate char­ac­ter ex­ists purely for laughs.</p>
    <p>While it seems that gay char­ac­ters are pop­ping up ev­ery­where th­ese days, on closer in­spec­tion, their tales have lit­tle im­pact on the sto­ries be­ing told.</p>
    <p>“In main­stream films, they are usu­ally de­picted as side char­ac­ters who rarely have their own sto­ry­lines. They are usu­ally there to sup­port the dilem­mas of the main leads,” he says.</p>
    <p>Suk Suk, with the orig­i­nal Can­tonese di­a­logue (with English sub­ti­tles), is be­ing screened as part of the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Film Fes­ti­val 2020 from Oct 10. Tick­ets are sell­ing fast, but more ses­sions are be­ing added. De­tails at Film­garde Cine­plexes (str.sg/JBBV)</p>
