    <p>In­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies who have signed con­tracts for such ac­tiv­i­ties as wed­ding cel­e­bra­tions, con­fer­ences and hol­i­day tours, have been given another month to ap­ply for pro­tec­tion from le­gal ac­tion for fail­ing to ful­fil their con­trac­tual obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>The re­lief pe­riod for these con­tracts was sched­uled to have ended yes­ter­day, but the Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) has ex­tended the dead­line to Jan 31.</p>
    <p>It said that, in the light of fur­ther eas­ing of re­stric­tions un­der phase three of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, “there will be more scope to make al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments and ad­just­ments to the orig­i­nal con­tract terms”.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, par­ties to a con­tract for a large wed­ding may agree to hold­ing the event on the con­tracted date but on a smaller scale at an ap­pro­pri­ately re­duced price. “This would be a fair re­sult.”</p>
    <p>The re­lief pro­vided for these con­tracts was in­tro­duced ini­tially un­der the Covid-19 Tem­po­rary Mea­sures Act on April 7.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment yes­ter­day, the min­istry also strongly en­cour­aged the par­ties in­volved to ne­go­ti­ate for a solution if the event can­not pro­ceed at all owing to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It said par­ties should ap­ply for re­lief only if they are un­able to reach an agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Act, one party can serve a no­ti­fi­ca­tion for re­lief on the other. It must be done by the last day of the re­lief pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Once done, the de­posits paid for the event or tour can­not be au­to­mat­i­cally for­feited, and can­cel­la­tion fees are payable only if an asses­sor ap­pointed by MinLaw de­cides such fees are just and fair.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also said that even when a no­ti­fi­ca­tion for re­lief is served, ne­go­ti­a­tions be­tween the par­ties should con­tinue.</p>
    <p>“The in­ten­tion is to pre­vent any such for­fei­ture or can­cel­la­tion charge from hap­pen­ing, so that par­ties may fo­cus on dis­cus­sion, un­der­stand­ing each other’s po­si­tions and try­ing to reach a mu­tu­ally agree­able com­pro­mise on the con­duct of the event or tour.”</p>
    <p>If no agree­ment is reached, ei­ther party can ap­ply for an asses­sor to make a de­ci­sion. This can stretch up to two months from the end of the new re­lief dead­line, or by March 31 at the lat­est.</p>
    <p>In some cases, as­ses­sors may re­quire the par­ties to at­tend me­di­a­tion or ex­plain why they can­not make al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments, such as reschedul­ing the event or hold­ing it on a smaller scale.</p>
    <p>The re­lief pe­riod for other con­tracts re­mains un­changed.</p>
    <p>Re­lief for hire-pur­chase, con­di­tional sales and rental agree­ments for com­mer­cial equip­ment or com­mer­cial ve­hi­cles will end, as sched­uled, on Jan 31.</p>
    <p>As for prop­erty, the re­lief pe­riod for op­tion to pur­chase as well as sale and pur­chase agree­ments with de­vel­op­ers will end on March 31. It is also the case for con­struc­tion con­tracts or sup­ply con­tracts.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted yes­ter­day, Mrs Ch­eryl Tan, founder of The Wed­ding Con­cep­teur wed­ding plan­ning firm, said the ex­tended dead­line will give busi­ness own­ers like her more time to find an ideal solution for their clients.</p>
    <p>Cou­ples of­ten book as early as 11/</p>
    <p>2 years in ad­vance, and her firm is flex­i­ble in meet­ing re­quests, like let­ting them ten­ta­tively book more than one date or post­pon­ing the wed­ding to the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>“No­body ex­pects or wants this to hap­pen to their wed­ding. It is a sub­stan­tial fi­nan­cial loss to us, but plan­ning a wed­ding should be a joy­ous oc­ca­sion.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing un­der­stand­ing and ac­com­mo­dat­ing is the least we can do to help our clients.”</p>
