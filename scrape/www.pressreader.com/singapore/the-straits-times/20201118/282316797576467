    <p>NEW YORK • Since the Mi­ami Mar­lins named Kim Ng (right) as their new gen­eral man­ager last Fri­day, mak­ing her the first woman to hold that ti­tle in any of the ma­jor men’s sports leagues in North Amer­ica, she said she had been flooded with over 1,000 e-mails and text mes­sages of con­grat­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The senders in­cluded cur­rent and for­mer man­agers, scouts, front-of­fice ex­ec­u­tives, play­ers, fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>“I got calls and text mes­sages from guys that I’ve known over the years who were just so ex­cited to tell their daugh­ters and wives,” Ng, 51, said from Mar­lins Park dur­ing her in­tro­duc­tory press con­fer­ence on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“I got voice­mails from friends and front-of­fice ex­ec­u­tives with tears, just so happy that I had bro­ken through, but re­ally more for the sport and more about what it meant for us in so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>A few mes­sages stood out to Ng, namely a tweet from for­mer United States first lady Michelle Obama and another from for­mer ten­nis star Bil­lie Jean King.</p>
    <p>“With 30 years’ ex­pe­ri­ence as a base­ball ex­ec­u­tive, she’s made his­tory as the first woman and first Asian Amer­i­can to hold the top post in a base­ball op­er­a­tions de­part­ment,” 12-time Grand Slam sin­gles cham­pion King wrote. “Progress!”</p>
    <p>Long viewed as the woman who could break this gen­der bar­rier in Ma­jor League Base­ball (MLB), Ng said she felt an enor­mous re­spon­si­bil­ity to con­tinue serv­ing as an ex­am­ple for fe­males, par­tic­u­larly those in­ter­ested in base­ball, a sport dom­i­nated by white men.</p>
    <p>“There’s an adage, ‘You can’t be it if you can’t see it’,” Ng said. “I sug­gest to them, ‘Now they can see it’. And so I look for­ward to hear­ing all of their sto­ries and just how in­spired they are to now pur­sue a job in sports, a job in base­ball and to reach for the stars.”</p>
