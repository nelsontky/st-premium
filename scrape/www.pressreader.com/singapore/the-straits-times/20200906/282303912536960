    <p>A jaunt across the bor­der; drop­ping my bags in a new ho­tel; a week­end­long whirl­wind of brunches, naps and never feel­ing hun­gry be­cause 24 hours is not enough time for all the good food.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Covid-19 struck, this was my an­nual get­away in Jo­hor Baru. With bor­ders closed, I find sim­i­lar ad­ven­tures in the up-and-com­ing neigh­bour­hood of Jalan Be­sar, with a stay at Ho­tel Yan in Tyr­whitt Road.</p>
    <p>Its name cap­tures the spirit of travel – Yan means swal­low in Man­darin – and this mo­tif re­curs in the ho­tel’s de­sign. Its logo is a sleek bird’s feather and an in­stal­la­tion of metal birds adorns a con­crete wall be­hind the check-in counter.</p>
    <p>The in­dus­trial in­te­ri­ors are a nod to the build­ing’s for­mer life as a metal ware­house, amid hard­ware stores that line sur­round­ing streets.</p>
    <p>Some have moved out in re­cent years as cafes such as Wim­bly Lu and Black Fairy Cof­fee sprung up, says di­rec­tor Eileen Lim, who opened the ho­tel with her hus­band in 2015.</p>
    <p>The con­crete-chic de­sign con­tin­ues in my su­pe­rior dou­ble with bal­cony view, which is com­pact but func­tional. A nar­row bal­cony with drap­ing reeds lends a pop of colour.</p>
    <p>Start­ing at $159, the room is good value, but it is best to be well ac­quainted with your bed­fel­low be­fore shar­ing the 12 to 15 sq m digs.</p>
    <p>Toi­let and shower cu­bi­cles share a sin­gle slid­ing door – which means only one can be shut at a time. For the sake of pri­vacy, a cur­tain sep­a­rates the bed from the bath­room.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel is scant on ameni­ties, re­ly­ing on its sur­round­ings in­stead.</p>
    <p>Only street park­ing is avail­able, and in lieu of a gym and pool, Mrs Lim says some guests head to the nearby Jalan Be­sar Ac­tiveSG gym or swim­ming com­plex. Wisely, there is no in-house restau­rant or break­fast of­fered. Why com­pete with all the good food around?</p>
    <p>Across the street, in a cof­fee shop below Ho­tel 81 Ele­gance, Dy­nasty Fried Por­ridge dishes out Malaysian favourites such as Kuala Lumpur-style Hokkien mee. I or­der its epony­mous dish ($7) and it ar­rives thick, gooey and gen­tly charred, stud­ded with cubes of fried lard.</p>
    <p>Nearby, Gelato Labo fea­tures a menu in­flu­enced by fruit, herbs and spices. A server de­scribes its sea­sonal flavour of smoked ar­ti­choke and pear com­pote as “epi­curean”, which I in­ter­pret as an ac­quired taste, and set­tle for the safer op­tion of navel orange and white chrysan­the­mum ($5). This turns out to be re­fresh­ing. A laven­der cone ($1.40) adds fra­grance and flavour.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing is within close prox­im­ity, so it is easy to duck back to my room for a video call. The Wi-Fi is zippy and power plugs be­neath the desk are a nice touch.</p>
    <p>At sun­down, I wan­der through mu­ral-painted al­leys look­ing for a din­ner spot and chance upon Scaled by Ah Hua Ke­long, which moved from Haji Lane to Hamil­ton Road this year. I am im­pressed by the sea bass with briny nori cream tagli­atelle, el­e­vated by pa­per-thin slices of tart pick­led radish and a sprin­kling of to­biko for crunch. At $23, it is good value.</p>
    <p>There is too much to eat and too lit­tle time. When I check out the next day, the lunch crowd has al­ready de­scended on cof­fee shop stall 88 Hong Kong Roast Meat Spe­cial­ist across the road, with char siew and ul­tra-crispy roast pork so pop­u­lar they sold out daily even dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Caf­feine fiends have al­ready gath­ered out­side Chye Seng Huat Hard­ware. And the ex­ten­sive craft beer menu at Drug­gists beck­ons. I will be back for another round of graz­ing.</p>
    <p>• HOT TIP: Ho­tel guests get a 10 per cent dis­count on food at Black Fairy Cof­fee across the street, which serves Ja­panese bento and cafe fare.</p>
