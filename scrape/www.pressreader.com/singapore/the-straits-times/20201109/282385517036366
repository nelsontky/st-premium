    <p>The Pu­lau Ubin of our child­hood was a place where we could show off how tough we were to our friends, whether it was cy­cling along the is­land’s un­paved trails, or go­ing through the Out­ward Bound Sin­ga­pore ad­ven­ture camp.</p>
    <p>But as we found out dur­ing this as­sign­ment, the is­land is far more im­por­tant than just a place of es­cape for city-dwellers.</p>
    <p>The isle may be a bum­boat ride away, but the con­ser­va­tion suc­cesses there have helped en­rich bio­di­ver­sity on the main­land.</p>
    <p>The ori­en­tal pied horn­bills are a per­fect ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Once ex­tinct in Sin­ga­pore, these birds even­tu­ally made their way back here from Malaysia. But it was Ubin that was their first stop.</p>
    <p>A suc­cess­ful con­ser­va­tion pro­gramme there helped im­prove their numbers so much that some even­tu­ally made their way to the main­land. Today, these birds can be found all across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>As the many re­searchers, nat­u­ral­ists and con­ser­va­tion man­agers ex­plained to us dur­ing our many re­port­ing trips to the is­land, Ubin is so rich in life for a few rea­sons.</p>
    <p>One, it is a tiny is­land that is home to a va­ri­ety of habi­tats – from man­groves to mud­flats. Two, its lo­ca­tion be­tween main­land Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia al­lows it to wel­come an­i­mal species that swim or fly from ei­ther side of the Cause­way.</p>
    <p>The horn­bills, with their dis­tinct beaks and loud cack­les, may be one of the more no­tice­able species to ben­e­fit from this way sta­tion.</p>
    <p>But con­ser­va­tion ef­forts un­der way on Ubin, like those that aim to help boost the numbers of birds like the blue-throated bee-eater or the Asian small-clawed ot­ter, could fur­ther en­rich the main­land’s wildlife in­ven­tory – es­pe­cially as Sin­ga­pore as­pires to be­come a City in Na­ture.</p>
    <p>Pre­par­ing for this fea­ture, we puz­zled over how this story show­cas­ing the in­ti­mate link be­tween Ubin and the main­land should be told.</p>
    <p>Pic­tures and videos speak louder than words, and so, ef­forts were made to “follow” the foot­steps of the an­i­mals that made it across the strait.</p>
    <p>In a nod to the an­i­mals that swam across (likely ot­ters and wild boars), we de­ployed a GoPro in an un­der­wa­ter dome hous­ing.</p>
    <p>The footage also showed the rich life un­der­wa­ter – sea­grass mead­ows and colour­ful warty sea cu­cum­bers – of­ten out of sight to the land-bound be­cause of the murky wa­ter.</p>
    <p>And in a trib­ute to the an­i­mals that flew, we took to the sky (with the rel­e­vant per­mits) to cap­ture a bird’s-eye view of this land in be­tween, and its prox­im­ity to both Malaysia and main­land Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing this time of Covid-19 – with recre­ational travel largely off the cards – Ubin re­mains an es­cape for many Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>But, as we have learnt, its rus­tic en­vi­ron­ment is not just a respite for peo­ple. An­i­mals that thrive there also make their way back to the main­land, adding life to our grey cityscape.</p>
    <p>In the words of one of our in­ter­vie­wees, bi­ol­ogy lec­turer N. Si­va­sothi: “We are re­ally lucky we have Ubin.”</p>
