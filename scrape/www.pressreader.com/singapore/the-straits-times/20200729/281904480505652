    <p>TOKYO/PYEONGCHAN­G (South Korea) • The Ja­panese gov­ern­ment re­acted an­grily yes­ter­day to a statue in South Korea that ap­pears to de­pict Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe kneel­ing and bow­ing be­fore a seated “com­fort woman”, a eu­phemism for women forced to work in Ja­pan’s wartime broth­els.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga said if re­ports of the statue on dis­play were true, it would be an un­for­giv­able breach of in­ter­na­tional pro­to­col.</p>
    <p>“If the re­ports are ac­cu­rate, then there would be a de­ci­sive im­pact on Ja­pan-Korea re­la­tions,” Mr Suga told a news con­fer­ence in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>The head of a pri­vately run South Korean botanic gar­den who com­mis­sioned the work said the kneel­ing fig­ure was meant to de­pict any­one who could be in the position to apol­o­gise for­mally for the his­toric wrong, and not Mr Abe in par­tic­u­lar. Mr Kim Chang-ryul told Reuters that he had not an­tic­i­pated the statue in­flam­ing an al­ready com­pli­cated diplo­matic is­sue.</p>
    <p>The web­site of the gar­den, which is in the ru­ral Pyeongchan­g county, names the statue Eter­nal Atone­ment. South Korea’s For­eign Min­istry said there may be in­ter­na­tional pro­to­col to con­sider, but de­clined fur­ther com­ment, say­ing it was an act by a private cit­i­zen.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of com­fort women – mostly Kore­ans forced to work in Ja­pan’s broth­els be­fore and dur­ing World War II – and the ques­tion of whether they were ad­e­quately com­pen­sated, have long been a thorn in ties.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan re­gards the mat­ter as “fi­nally and ir­re­versibly re­solved” by a 2015 agree­ment reached by Mr Abe and then South Korean Pres­i­dent Park Geun-hye un­der which Mr Abe apol­o­gised and pledged a fund to sup­port the sur­vivors.</p>
    <p>But the gov­ern­ment of cur­rent South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jaein has de­clared the deal flawed.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar stat­ues of girls alone have been set up in front of the Ja­panese Em­bassy in Seoul and else­where to hon­our the women.</p>
    <p>Bi­lat­eral ties were strained last year when Ja­pan im­posed ex­port curbs on high-tech ma­te­ri­als to South Korea fol­low­ing a South Korean court rul­ing or­der­ing Ja­panese firms to pay com­pen­sa­tion to Kore­ans forced to work for them dur­ing the war.</p>
