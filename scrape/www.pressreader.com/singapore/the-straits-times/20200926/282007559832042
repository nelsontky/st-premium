    <p>MADRID • Politi­cians here seem to be mys­ti­fied as to why Spain is, once again, the Euro­pean coun­try hard­est hit by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. They have blamed the reck­less­ness of youth, our Latin in­abil­ity to keep our dis­tance, and even im­mi­gra­tion. And yet all this time the an­swer has been right un­der their noses: Noth­ing has eased the spread of the virus as much as their own in­com­pe­tence.</p>
    <p>Spa­niards pa­tiently ac­cepted the tough­est con­fine­ment in Europe dur­ing the first wave of the virus in March, en­dur­ing se­ri­ous eco­nomic losses in ex­change for protecting the lives of their el­ders and the most vul­ner­a­ble. We have been among the most dis­ci­plined in ad­her­ing to reg­u­la­tions like wear­ing masks, which are used by more than 84 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Yet, to­day we are see­ing our sac­ri­fices be­ing squan­dered by a po­lit­i­cal class that did not hold up its end of the bar­gain.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the Madrid gov­ern­ment im­posed a par­tial lock­down in 37 ar­eas; on Wed­nes­day it re­quested ur­gent as­sis­tance from the army and the dis­patch of at least 300 doc­tors af­ter be­ing over­whelmed by a new wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Spain had the virus un­der con­trol when it ended the state of emer­gency on June 21. Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez de­clared vic­tory and or­gan­ised a hasty loos­en­ing of the lock­down that in­cluded the re­open­ing of the tourism in­dus­try. Re­spon­si­bil­ity for health­care man­age­ment was handed off from a cen­tral gov­ern­ment that had han­dled the pan­demic in­eptly (Spain led in mor­tal­ity and health-worker in­fec­tion rates) to the coun­try’s 17 au­ton­o­mous re­gions, which have not done any bet­ter. The fact that there were a few ex­cep­tions, such as the north­ern re­gion of As­turias, only un­der­scores the wide­spread fail­ure.</p>
    <p>Be­fore this sec­ond wave, there was plenty of time to put in place mea­sures that have shown their ef­fec­tive­ness in Asian coun­tries and have less­ened the im­pact of the pan­demic in closer ones, such as Por­tu­gal.</p>
    <p>But our politi­cians de­cided to ig­nore them: Health­care sys­tems were not for­ti­fied, plans were not made for the re­open­ing of schools, and the track­ing sys­tem rec­om­mended by all the ex­perts was not put into place.</p>
    <p>One of the keys to slow­ing the spread of the virus is to per­form poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test­ing on as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble who have been in con­tact with in­fected peo­ple. But the av­er­age num­ber of po­ten­tial cases that Spain man­ages to trace is lower than Zam­bia (9.7 for every con­firmed Covid-19 case), one-fourth that of Italy (37.5) and one-twen­ti­eth of Fin­land (185).</p>
    <p>Our politi­cians have lit­tle in­cen­tive to strive for ex­cel­lence, be­cause they know that Spa­niards’ loy­alty to their par­ties ri­vals their loy­alty to their favourite soc­cer teams.</p>
    <p>Ide­ol­ogy and par­ti­san­ship carry more weight at the polls than the can­di­dates’ prepa­ra­tion, hon­esty and ex­pe­ri­ence, send­ing them the mes­sage that their suc­cess doesn’t de­pend on their man­age­ment or the re­sults they ob­tain. If the pan­demic has taught us any­thing, it’s that the price of not hav­ing our very best at the helm is too high.</p>
    <p>While po­lit­i­cal par­ties con­tin­ued to de­flect blame about who was re­spon­si­ble for the first wave, the sec­ond wave was al­ready un­der way.</p>
    <p>Now it is out of con­trol and dozens of places are once again en­dur­ing lock­down re­stric­tions. Hos­pi­tals, which have a chronic deficit of doc­tors, are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing deja vu. The health­care work­ers we ap­plauded as he­roes in March and April view “the spec­ta­cle of our po­lit­i­cal lead­ers with de­jec­tion and in­dig­na­tion”, ac­cord­ing to the Gen­eral Coun­cil of Of­fi­cial Med­i­cal Col­leges of Spain.</p>
    <p>Of course, th­ese frus­tra­tions are not unique to Spain. The con­flu­ence of the pan­demic and the emer­gence of pop­ulism and ex­trem­ism around the world, from the United States to the</p>
    <p>Philip­pines, has hin­dered re­sponses that are based on knowl­edge, sci­ence and ef­fec­tive man­age­ment. But in the case of Spain, th­ese prob­lems tran­scend the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Our po­lit­i­cal par­ties have be­come or­gan­i­sa­tions that are her­met­i­cally closed to out­side tal­ent. Spa­niards do not elect in­di­vid­ual can­di­dates, but choose a re­gional party list with can­di­dates se­lected by the par­ties in a process where in­trigue and re­la­tion­ships count more than com­pe­tence. Most of our rep­re­sen­ta­tives ar­rive at po­si­tions of re­spon­si­bil­ity with no ex­pe­ri­ence be­yond the po­lit­i­cal. Only 36 per cent of Congress mem­bers in 2018 de­clared that they had ever worked in the pri­vate sec­tor.</p>
    <p>In nor­mal times, Spain’s po­lit­i­cal dys­func­tion was less ob­vi­ous. But the pan­demic has re­vealed a painful truth: In­com­pe­tence costs lives and ru­ins economies. This is ev­i­dent in the re­gion of Madrid; to­day the fi­nan­cial and gov­ern­men­tal cen­tre of Spain is in dire straits.</p>
    <p>New York and Madrid were in sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tions in June. Af­ter ini­tially be­ing hard hit by the coro­n­avirus, both cities seemed to have the pan­demic un­der con­trol. Since then, the re­gion of Madrid has seen cases mul­ti­ply to 772 per 100,000 in­hab­i­tants while New York has kept the sit­u­a­tion un­der con­trol with 28 in­fec­tions per 100,000 in­hab­i­tants.</p>
    <p>There is no mys­tery here ei­ther: The dif­fer­ence is ex­plained by the num­ber of track­ers, hos­pi­tal sup­port, pru­dent re­open­ing of busi­nesses, and tests.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, the pres­i­dent of the com­mu­nity of Madrid, Ms Is­abel Diaz Ayuso, a mem­ber of the con­ser­va­tive Pop­u­lar Party that has been rul­ing the re­gion for 25 years, had promised track­ers, health­care re­in­force­ments, and school­teach­ers, who have ar­rived late or not at all. In ad­di­tion to the tensions with the cen­tral gov­ern­ment, ex­perts’ rec­om­men­da­tions have been sub­ject to po­lit­i­cal op­por­tunism, mea­sures have been put in prac­tice too late and, char­ac­ter­is­tic of Spain’s rul­ing class, blame has been spread to avoid re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Rev­ers­ing medi­ocrity in Span­ish pol­i­tics will re­quire pro­found re­forms that must be­gin with ed­u­ca­tion, whose ben­e­fits in fos­ter­ing a new gen­er­a­tion of lead­ers may not ap­pear for years. But noth­ing is stop­ping us from be­gin­ning with more con­crete mea­sures that could slow our po­lit­i­cal de­cline.</p>
    <p>It is cru­cial for Spain to re­form elec­toral law so that vot­ers choose their rep­re­sen­ta­tives di­rectly, re­think the ter­ri­to­rial or­gan­i­sa­tion that has caused a lack of co­or­di­na­tion among re­gions, and strengthen the in­de­pen­dence of gov­ern­ment in­sti­tu­tions, which are filled with politi­cians who of­fer blind loy­alty to their po­lit­i­cal par­ties.</p>
    <p>Yet none of this will mat­ter if Span­ish lead­ers aren’t held ac­count­able at the polls.</p>
    <p>In the next elec­tion we should not for­get those re­spon­si­ble for the dis­as­trous han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
