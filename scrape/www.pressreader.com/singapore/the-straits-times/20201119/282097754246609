    <p>Some 2,000 pre-school­ers in the North West District are learn­ing about the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing the en­vi­ron­ment through play.</p>
    <p>The Bud­ding Gree­nies @ North West pro­gramme, which in­volves ex­ploratory and imag­i­na­tive play, was launched at more than 20 preschools yes­ter­day by the North West Com­mu­nity De­vel­op­ment Coun­cil (CDC).</p>
    <p>One ma­jor fea­ture is a learn­ing sta­tion to il­lus­trate sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues. It will be called “Green Cor­ners” where pupils can set up a re­cy­cling cor­ner and grow in­door plants. Teach­ers will have ac­cess to a guide­book to fa­cil­i­tate the cre­ation of “Green Cor­ners” within pre-schools. North West CDC will grant $500 per pre-school for the “Green Cor­ners” every year.</p>
    <p>The chil­dren will also have a new in­ter­ac­tive ac­tiv­ity book, the se­cond edition of Go Green With Betty The But­ter­fly, which raises aware­ness of en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues and helps them un­der­stand how to make a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The ac­tiv­ity book was de­vel­oped in part­ner­ship with Ms Grace Lim, 56, who was a bi­ol­o­gist at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore and now de­scribes her­self as an en­vi­ron­men­tal ed­u­ca­tor. She runs an ed­u­ca­tional com­pany, CreativeKi­ds.</p>
    <p>The book was the brain­child of Ms Lim who felt there was a lack of ma­te­rial for chil­dren about sus­tain­abil­ity, es­pe­cially con­tent that they could re­late to. She said: “There are many en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues to­day and chil­dren are un­aware of many of them. So, as ed­u­ca­tors and par­ents, we need to teach them well – with bal­ance and ac­cu­rately.”</p>
    <p>The book maps out dif­fer­ent en­vi­ron­men­tal themes per­ti­nent to Sin­ga­pore such as sav­ing wa­ter, dengue aware­ness and re­duc­ing waste. It fea­tures colour­ing pages, mazes and games.</p>
    <p>“It is like the ex­ten­sion of the de­vel­op­ment of val­ues. Chil­dren are taught to re­spect, to be re­spon­si­ble and to care for peo­ple. Now we ex­tend that to liv­ing things and our en­vi­ron­ment,” said Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>North West District Mayor Alex Yam, who at­tended the launch event at PCF Sparkle­tots @ Yew Tee Block 690D, watched a les­son for pre-school­ers.</p>
    <p>“The launch of Bud­ding Gree­nies @ North West is an im­por­tant first step to achieve a live­able and sus­tain­able com­mu­nity, which we all have a role to play,” said Mr Yam.</p>
    <p>“While the CDC con­tin­ues to engage a wide spec­trum of res­i­dents to pro­mote green liv­ing, much em­pha­sis will be de­voted to a younger au­di­ence. The aim is to cul­ti­vate and im­bue green val­ues which our res­i­dents can adopt for life.”</p>
