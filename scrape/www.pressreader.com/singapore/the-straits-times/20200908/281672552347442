    <p>Af­ter the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hit, about 70 per cent of the con­tracted projects man­aged by events com­pany MICE De­pot had to be ei­ther re­worked, de­layed or can­celled.</p>
    <p>Of this num­ber, one in five was an event in­volv­ing overseas vis­i­tors, said com­pany di­rec­tor Fran­cis Tan.</p>
    <p>To adapt to Covid-19 re­stric­tions, MICE De­pot adopted a hy­brid model for its events – al­low­ing the on-site at­ten­dance of up to 50 peo­ple since July, while oth­ers at­tended the event vir­tu­ally. Some events were also fully vir­tual.</p>
    <p>De­scrib­ing the move as an “in­ten­sive pivot”, Mr Tan said this helped his firm re­gain about 50 per cent of rev­enue lost from events de­layed or can­celled af­ter the alert was raised to Dorscon Orange in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also man­aged to avoid re­trench­ing any of its em­ploy­ees, added Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>“The re­source de­mands for hy­brid projects are pretty sim­i­lar to phys­i­cal events in terms of num­bers, with the key dif­fer­ence be­ing the evo­lu­tion­ary progress of dig­i­tal and broad­cast skill sets, in­ter­nal train­ing pro­grammes and the adop­tion of pos­i­tive mind­sets,” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he added that the sit­u­a­tion will con­tinue to be chal­leng­ing for Mice com­pa­nies, and the in­dus­try will need to con­tin­u­ally think of cre­ative and ef­fi­cient so­lu­tions to keep busi­nesses go­ing.</p>
