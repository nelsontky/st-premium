    <p>Buy tick­ets for a movie at VivoCity us­ing your mo­bile wal­let and then get dis­counts on your pri­vate-hire ride to the mall and when shop­ping there.</p>
    <p>This is the kind of per­son­alised ex­pe­ri­ence DBS Bank aims to cre­ate on its PayLah! e-wal­let as it zeroes in on its goal of hav­ing 3.5 mil­lion users on the plat­form by 2023.</p>
    <p>Mr An­thony Seow, head of pay­ments and plat­forms at DBS, said the bank plans to in­te­grate ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and ma­chine learn­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties, which are al­ready used in its dig­i­tal bank­ing ser­vices, into PayLah!.</p>
    <p>“This means we will de­velop mean­ing­ful in­sights sim­i­lar to what we al­ready de­liver on our di­gibank – for ex­am­ple, through monthly bill re­minders, spend­ing in­sights and re­minders for out­stand­ing ac­tions such as pay­ing friends for your share of a meal,” he said.</p>
    <p>The bank’s re­cent merger of its DBS Lifestyle re­wards app with PayLah! has also al­lowed it to ob­tain con­sumer spend­ing in­sights from a pool of more than 500 card mer­chant part­ners, said Mr Seow.</p>
    <p>PayLah! has signed on 1.8 mil­lion users since its launch in 2014. These in­clude new users it gained amid the pan­demic, which ac­cel­er­ated the push for all things dig­i­tal. New sign-ups grew by nearly 40 per cent last Oc­to­ber com­pared with the same month in 2019.</p>
    <p>DBS also plans to link debit and credit cards di­rectly to PayLah! to give cus­tomers more pay­ment choices. They can now top up the e-wal­let via their bank ac­count or se­lect an auto-debit op­tion.</p>
    <p>The move might ben­e­fit con­sumers such as qual­ity as­sur­ance spe­cial­ist Joseph Lim, 28, who prefers to use PayNow on his mo­bile bank­ing app as he can ac­cess his funds di­rectly in­stead of hav­ing to top up an e-wal­let.</p>
    <p>“If I use a mo­bile wal­let, I’d like some­thing fuss-free and with not too many lay­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers might also soon be able to re­deem their cash­back or re­wards points at all of DBS’ mer­chant part­ners, and have their to­tal spend­ing across all of the bank’s dig­i­tal pay­ment op­tions con­sid­ered dur­ing loy­alty cam­paigns.</p>
    <p>PayLah! also plans to have more part­ners, like e-com­merce firms, on the app. Last year, it roped in taxi gi­ant Com­fort­Del­Gro and hawker food de­liv­ery start-up WhyQ, al­low­ing users to ac­cess their ser­vices and pay via the e-wal­let.</p>
    <p>PayLah! will give small-busi­ness own­ers ac­cess to new self-help tools, such as a “dis­cov­er­abil­ity fea­ture” and the op­tion to cre­ate mar­ket­ing cam­paigns that re­ward cus­tomer loy­alty.</p>
    <p>Mr Seow said: “We are try­ing to</p>

    <p>build things to cater to smaller mer­chants. Some of them might not have the funds to go dig­i­tal. Even if they do, there’s also the ques­tion of how to reach out to cus­tomers.”</p>
    <p>The value of “scan to pay” trans­ac­tions made by con­sumers to mer­chants via PayLah! more than dou­bled last Oc­to­ber from the same month in 2019.</p>
    <p>Mr Seow said greater com­pe­ti­tion from fin­tech firms will cre­ate more op­por­tu­ni­ties for PayLah! to grow.</p>
    <p>“If you run a busi­ness to­day, you’d bet­ter em­brace com­pe­ti­tion from day one or you’ll be like an ostrich with your head in the ground, avoid­ing what will even­tu­ally hap­pen. Fin­techs will be there, and it is im­por­tant for us to open up.”</p>
