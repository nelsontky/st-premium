    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US coron­avirus deaths rose by over 25,000 in July and cases dou­bled in 19 states dur­ing the month, according to a Reuters tally, deal­ing a crush­ing blow to hopes of quickly re­open­ing the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The United States recorded 1.87 mil­lion new cases last month, bring­ing total in­fec­tions to 4.5 mil­lion, for an in­crease of 69 per cent. Deaths rose 20 per cent in July to nearly 154,000 in total.</p>
    <p>The big­gest in­creases last month were in Florida, with over 310,000 new cases, fol­lowed by Cal­i­for­nia and Texas with about 260,000 each. All three states saw cases dou­bling.</p>
    <p>Cases also more than dou­bled in Alabama, Alaska, Ari­zona, Arkansas, Ge­or­gia, Hawaii, Idaho, Mis­sis­sippi, Mis­souri, Mon­tana, Ne­vada, Ok­la­homa, Ore­gon, South Carolina, Ten­nessee and West Vir­ginia, according to the tally.</p>
    <p>Con­necti­cut, Mas­sachusetts, New Jersey and New York had the low­est in­creases, with cases ris­ing 8 per cent or less.</p>
    <p>The US shat­tered sin­gle-day global records when it re­ported over 77,000 new cases on July 16. In that month, 33 out of the 50 US states had one-day record i ncreases in cases and 19 set records for their rise in deaths in 24 hours, according to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>After a rapid ac­cel­er­a­tion in cases, the out­break ap­pears to be sta­bil­is­ing in Sun­belt states, in­clud­ing Ari­zona, Florida and Texas. Health of­fi­cials are now con­cerned the out­break has mi­grated to the Mid­west, in­clud­ing the states of Ohio, Ne­braska and Mis­souri, from sum­mer travel.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said last Fri­day that hun­dreds of chil­dren con­tracted the coron­avirus at a sum­mer camp in the south-eastern state of Ge­or­gia last month, adding to a grow­ing body of ev­i­dence that mi­nors are both sus­cep­ti­ble to in­fec­tion and vec­tors of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The US last Fri­day saw the fourth straight day of more than 1,200 deaths from the coron­avirus pan­demic, when it counted 1,442 new deaths in the 24 hours lead­ing up to 8.30pm last Fri­day lo­cal time, according to a tally by Johns Hop­kins Uni­ver­sity.</p>
    <p>The US is the country hard­est hit by the pan­demic in the world, with at least 2.3 mil­lion peo­ple hav­ing re­cov­ered so far from the dis­ease.</p>
