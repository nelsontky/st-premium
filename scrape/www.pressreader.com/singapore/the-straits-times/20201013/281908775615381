    <p>STOCKHOLM • US econ­o­mists Paul Mil­grom and Robert Wil­son have won the 2020 No­bel Eco­nomics Prize for im­prove­ments to auc­tion the­ory and in­ven­tions of new auc­tion for­mats, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The new auc­tion for­mats are a beau­ti­ful ex­am­ple of how ba­sic re­search can sub­se­quently gen­er­ate in­ven­tions that ben­e­fit so­ci­ety,” the academy said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The No­bel Prize’s of­fi­cial web­site tweeted: “Auc­tions are every­where and af­fect our ev­ery­day lives. This year’s Eco­nomic Sciences Lau­re­ates, Paul Mil­grom and Robert Wil­son, have i mproved auc­tion the­ory and in­vented new auc­tion for­mats, ben­e­fit­ing sell­ers, buy­ers and tax­pay­ers around the world.”</p>
    <p>New auc­tion for­mats have been used for ra­dio spec­tra, fish­ing quo­tas, air­craft land­ing slots and emis­sions al­lowances.</p>
    <p>“It’s very happy news, I’m very glad about it,” Pro­fes­sor Wil­son, 83, told a press con­fer­ence in Stockholm by phone from his home in Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Prof Wil­son, who was born in Ne­braska and stud­ied at Har­vard Univer­sity, was the the­sis ad­viser to his fel­low win­ner.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Mil­grom, 72, was born in Detroit and earned his PhD in busi­ness at Stan­ford in 1978.</p>
    <p>He and Prof Wil­son, along with Dr Pre­ston McAfee, are best known for the so-called si­mul­ta­ne­ous as­cend­ing auc­tion, which was de­vel­oped for the United States Fed­eral Com­mu­ni­ca­tions Com­mis­sion’s 1994 sale of spec­trum.</p>
    <p>The method has since been used to set prices on such things as elec­tric­ity and petrol.</p>
    <p>Prof Mil­grom ad­vised on Google’s 2004 ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing, and has also been an ad­viser</p>
    <p>to Ya­hoo, Mi­crosoft and gov­ern­ments across the world, ac­cord­ing to his web­site.</p>
    <p>Prof Wil­son was ques­tioned at the press con­fer­ence on what was the last thing he bought at an auc­tion.</p>
    <p>“My wife points out to me, we bought ski boots on eBay,” he said. “I guess that’s an auc­tion.”</p>
    <p>The eco­nomics prize, won by such lu­mi­nar­ies as pro­fes­sors Paul Krugman and Mil­ton Fried­man in the past, is the fi­nal of six awards this year – one in which the No­bels have been over­shad­owed by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The traditiona­l gala win­ners’ din­ner in De­cem­ber has been can­celled, and other parts of the cel­e­bra­tions are be­ing held dig­i­tally to avoid the risk of spread­ing the in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The 10 mil­lion Swedish krona (S$1.54 mil­lion) eco­nomics prize is not one of the orig­i­nal five awards cre­ated in the 1895 will of in­dus­tri­al­ist and dy­na­mite in­ven­tor Al­fred No­bel, but was es­tab­lished by Swe­den’s cen­tral bank and first awarded in 1969.</p>
    <p>The Nor­we­gian No­bel Com­mit­tee, how­ever, plans to go ahead with an award cer­e­mony, al­beit in a re­duced for­mat be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, in Oslo on Dec 10, the an­niver­sary of No­bel’s death.</p>
