    <p>Cheer­ful, bub­bly and with a love for the play­ground, 10-year-old Claire Lim is like any other child but for one dif­fer­ence – her left “eye” oc­ca­sion­ally drops out.</p>
    <p>She then takes it home to let her par­ents pop it back into her eye socket.</p>
    <p>Born with mi­croph­thalmia, a rare dis­or­der in which one or both eyes are ab­nor­mally small and dys­func­tional, Claire re­ceives a new eye pros­the­sis once ev­ery five years.</p>
    <p>Claire had a rare con­di­tion known as per­sis­tent hy­per­plas­tic pri­mary vit­re­ous – a spo­radic de­vel­op­men­tal ab­nor­mal­ity that typ­i­cally hap­pens in only one eye, said Dr Gan­gad­hara Sundar, head and se­nior con­sul­tant of Or­bit and Oculo­fa­cial Surgery in the Depart­ment of Oph­thal­mol­ogy at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal (NUH), who is one of her doc­tors.</p>
    <p>Claire’s con­di­tion was ad­vanced by the time she went to NUH as she was al­ready five, and sal­vaging her vi­sion was a dif­fi­cult mis­sion, Dr Sundar said.</p>
    <p>By then, Claire had al­ready ex­pe­ri­enced reti­nal de­tach­ment, a con­di­tion where the retina at the back of the eye pulls away from the layer of blood ves­sels that pro­vides it with oxy­gen and nu­tri­ents.</p>
    <p>Be­cause Claire had an in-turned left eye, doc­tors of­fered to fit her with an “ar­ti­fi­cial eye” to make her look nor­mal, boost­ing her self-es­teem and en­sur­ing so­cial ac­cept­abil­ity when she went to school, Dr Sundar added.</p>
    <p>Since she did not have her orig­i­nal eye and cornea re­moved, she would feel pain and be un­able to tol­er­ate a pros­the­sis as the cornea is sen­si­tive. Hence, doc­tors had to per­form surgery to use Claire’s own tis­sue to cover her cornea.</p>
    <p>Upon re­cov­ery, a pros­the­sis was then fit­ted com­fort­ably, Dr Sundar said.</p>
    <p>Claire had her first pros­the­sis fit­ted in 2015, which she took to very well, and her sec­ond one this year.</p>
    <p>An eye pros­the­sis typ­i­cally takes three to four work­ing days to make.</p>
    <p>Ms Suriya Abu Waled, the only oc­u­lar­ist in NUH, has made eye pros­the­ses for more than 200 pa­tients in the last 14 years.</p>
    <p>Her pa­tients in­clude chil­dren who are born with­out eyes as well as chil­dren and adults who have lost their eyes due to can­cer, se­vere in­juries and failed surgery.</p>
    <p>Each new pros­the­sis costs around $2,000 af­ter sub­si­dies and needs to be changed around once ev­ery five years.</p>
    <p>To make an eye pros­the­sis, an im­pres­sion first needs to be taken to de­ter­mine the ca­pac­ity of the eye socket. Then a wax model is made to ac­count for eye move­ments, such as when the pa­tient is look­ing right or left.</p>
    <p>Armed with a set of acrylic paints, Ms Suriya paints the pros­the­sis. It has to be left to dry for around two hours.</p>
    <p>A trans­par­ent layer is then ap­plied to form a coat on top of the pros­the­sis af­ter the paint has dried.</p>
    <p>The pros­the­sis then un­der­goes a fi­nal pol­ish to en­sure that there are no sharp edges be­fore it is given to the pa­tient.</p>
    <p>The 49-year-old oc­u­lar­ist, who sees around 15 new pa­tients a year, said: “I love the job be­cause I can help pa­tients re­gain their con­fi­dence and al­low them to lead their nor­mal lives.”</p>
    <p>Pa­tients who have suf­fered from eye trauma, dis­eases and con­di­tions such as retinoblas­toma – a rare form of can­cer that rapidly de­vel­ops from the im­ma­ture cells of a retina – and re­quire enu­cle­ation (eye re­moval) as part of their treat­ment visit Ms Suriya. They are as young as 18 months or as old as 85.</p>
    <p>Other than help­ing pa­tients look so­cially ac­cept­able, an eye pros­the­sis is also im­por­tant as it helps to hold the struc­ture of the eye and pre­vent it from shrink­ing and be­com­ing droopy.</p>
    <p>Fit­ting the pros­the­sis for the first time was both a painful and un­com­fort­able ex­pe­ri­ence, Claire told The Straits Times last Fri­day. “It was pretty painful when Ms Suriya first put the eye in, but a few hours later, the pain faded away,” she said.</p>
    <p>These days, Claire barely no­tices her pros­the­sis, and apart from need­ing eye drops three times a day, the en­er­getic girl can con­tinue to do what she loves – cy­cling, skip­ping and hav­ing fun in the play­ground.</p>
