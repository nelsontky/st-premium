    <p>Five months af­ter los­ing fed­eral power, the Chi­nese-based Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP) is fight­ing to de­fend its chief Lim Guan Eng from cor­rup­tion charges, amid claims of po­lit­i­cal per­se­cu­tion un­der the new Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Both Lim, Malaysia’s former fi­nance min­is­ter, and his wife Betty Chew are ex­pected to face fur­ther charges to­mor­row and on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Ms Chew’s lawyer, Mr Lee Khai, said on Fri­day that she will be charged in a But­ter­worth court on Tues­day un­der the anti-money laun­der­ing Act. It was un­clear if this is re­lated to a 2015 pur­chase of a heav­ily dis­counted bun­ga­low for which Lim was charged in 2016, but with the case dropped in 2018.</p>
    <p>Half of Lim’s RM1 mil­lion (S$327,000) bail was paid on Fri­day with funds bor­rowed from sup­port­ers, with the bal­ance due to­mor­row, said DAP na­tional pub­lic­ity sec­re­tary Tony Pua, who launched a fund-raiser yesterday.</p>
    <p>“Any sur­plus re­ceived from the do­na­tions will go to­wards the gen­eral elec­tion to fight the back­door (PN) gov­ern­ment and re­turn the man­date to Malaysians who voted for change in 2018,” said Mr Pua.</p>
    <p>Lim’s fa­ther and veteran politi­cian Lim Kit Siang said yesterday: “I am not sur­prised by Guan Eng’s ar­rest and pros­e­cu­tion, as this is to break his po­lit­i­cal spirit. The lat­est cor­rup­tion charge against him is prob­a­bly the first against a ma­jor po­lit­i­cal leader where no spe­cific sum of cor­rup­tion or grat­i­fi­ca­tion amount is men­tioned, only a vague 10 per cent of fu­ture prof­its.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve in my son that he nei­ther asked for money nor re­ceived any money, as proven by the fact that no such cor­rup­tion money was found on him in cash or in his per­sonal bank ac­count.”</p>
    <p>The DAP is hop­ing that Malaysians, though tired of the end­less bick­er­ing among politi­cians de­spite the Covid-19 pan­demic, will jump to Lim’s de­fence, with the first in­di­ca­tion be­ing the sums that will be col­lected in the fund-rais­ing ef­fort.</p>
    <p>The younger Lim re­vealed on Face­book on Fri­day that he slept on a wooden floor while be­ing de­tained overnight in the Malaysian Anti-Cor­rup­tion Com­mis­sion (MACC) lock-up.</p>
    <p>“I had to change to the (MACC) or­ange T-shirt and slept on the wooden floor in the small lock-up (no pil­low, no mat­tress), un­like my pre­de­ces­sor who did not spend a sin­gle night in the lock-up,” he said, re­fer­ring to former pre­mier Na­jib Razak, who was ar­rested by the MACC in 2018 over the 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had scan­dal.</p>
    <p>But MACC chief com­mis­sioner Azam Baki said: “There is no dou­ble stan­dard is­sue, all slept in the same cell and no one re­ceived bet­ter treat­ment than the other.”</p>
    <p>Former pre­mier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad, an ally of Lim, said he be­lieved that the charges were po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated. “We are in­clined to think so,” he said when asked by re­porters on Fri­day.</p>
