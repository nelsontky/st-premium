    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Try to avoid spilling too many de­tails. It is a good time for you to re­cruit new peo­ple to your cause, if you need them.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You have to talk to your sweetie or fam­ily – it is eas­ier than ever for you to ac­cess and share your feel­ings.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing per­fectly happy with how busy you are and your ter­rific en­ergy helps keep you sane through it all.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You are feel­ing pretty ir­ri­tated over some­thing some­one said this morn­ing – try not to let it bring you too far down.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You are hit with a big idea – it may come from out of nowhere, so make sure you are ready to jot it down or tell a friend as soon as it strikes.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You have a sharp mind and should find your­self reach­ing the cor­rect con­clu­sion far in advance of those around you.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Both sides of your per­son­al­ity are out in the open. You should find that at least one of them ap­peals to any given per­son.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>The temp­ta­tion is there to skim a lit­tle off the top, step out on your sweetie or do some­thing else that is just not your style. Re­sist it.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) There is a lot more talk than ac­tion go­ing on around you. That means it is up to you to shake things up, whether you are at work or at home.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Clear away all the de­tri­tus – you have to elim­i­nate any­thing that is more than you need. It is a good day to sell off some pos­ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your ro­man­tic side is open to new things. It may be time to spice things up in some way and your brain can fig­ure out some­thing.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Your cre­ative pow­ers are peak­ing – so push your­self in a new di­rec­tion. Your col­leagues and friends are more than will­ing to in­dulge you.</p>
