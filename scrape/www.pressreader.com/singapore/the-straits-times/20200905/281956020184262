    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity (DHS) has warned that Rus­sia is try­ing to un­der­mine Amer­i­cans’ con­fi­dence in the se­cu­rity and va­lid­ity of mail-in vot­ing.</p>
    <p>In a bulletin la­belled “For of­fi­cial use only” cir­cu­lated on Thurs­day, the DHS Of­fice of In­tel­li­gence and Anal­y­sis said Rus­sia was “likely to con­tinue am­pli­fy­ing crit­i­cism of vote by mail and shift­ing vot­ing pro­cesses amid the Covid-19 pan­demic to un­der­mine pub­lic trust in the elec­toral process”.</p>
    <p>The bulletin said that in mid-Au­gust, Rus­sian state me­dia out­lets and proxy web­sites pub­lished crit­i­cism of wide­spread mail-in vot­ing, “claim­ing in­el­i­gi­ble vot­ers could re­ceive ballots due to out-of-date voter rolls, leav­ing a vast amount of ballots un­ac­counted for and vul­ner­a­ble to tam­per­ing”.</p>
    <p>It said that since March, Rus­sian out­lets had also sought to un­der­mine con­fi­dence in mail-in vot­ing pro­cesses, al­leg­ing that they pro­vide “vast op­por­tu­ni­ties for voter fraud”.</p>
    <p>It said Rus­sia is likely to step up trolling by pro­mot­ing al­le­ga­tions of US elec­tion sys­tem cor­rup­tion, fail­ures and “for­eign ma­lign in­ter­fer­ence” to un­der­mine pub­lic trust in US elec­tions.</p>
    <p>The bulletin noted that fol­low­ing the Iowa cau­cuses this year, Rus­sian out­lets claimed that the re­sult was “fixed in favour of es­tab­lish­ment can­di­dates” and that vot­ing sys­tem prob­lems had re­sulted in “bal­lot ma­nip­u­la­tion”.</p>
    <p>The Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity had no im­me­di­ate com­ment. Rus­sia has de­nied in­ter­fer­ing in US elec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Adam Schiff, the Demo­crat who chairs the House In­tel­li­gence Committee, said the bulletin val­i­dated his con­cern that Rus­sia is seek­ing to “sow dis­trust in our demo­cratic process”.</p>
    <p>By at­tack­ing US mail-in bal­lot in­tegrity, Mr Schiff said, “Rus­sia is echo­ing de­struc­tive and false nar­ra­tives around vote by mail that Pres­i­dent Trump and his en­ablers, in­clud­ing At­tor­ney-Gen­eral (Wil­liam) Barr, have been ag­gres­sively pro­mot­ing”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has re­peat­edly crit­i­cised mail-in vot­ing, say­ing in one July 30 tweet: “With Univer­sal Mail-In Vot­ing (not Ab­sen­tee Vot­ing, which is good), 2020 will be the most IN­AC­CU­RATE & FRAUD­U­LENT Elec­tion in his­tory.”</p>
    <p>Rus­sia is echo­ing de­struc­tive and false nar­ra­tives around vote by mail that Pres­i­dent Trump and his en­ablers, in­clud­ing At­tor­ney-Gen­eral (Wil­liam) Barr, have been ag­gres­sively pro­mot­ing. ’’ DEMO­CRAT ADAM SCHIFF, who chairs the House In­tel­li­gence Committee, say­ing the bulletin val­i­dated his con­cern that Rus­sia is seek­ing to “sow dis­trust in our demo­cratic process”.</p>
