    <p>There were 51 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,404.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded one com­mu­nity case, a 65-year-old Sin­ga­porean woman, said MOH. She was iden­ti­fied as a con­tact of a pre­vi­ously con­firmed case and was tested when she was quar­an­tined ear­lier.</p>
    <p>There were also seven im­ported cases, com­pris­ing one per­ma­nent res­i­dent, two work per­mit hold­ers, three de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers and one long-term visit pass holder. All of them had been placed on stay­home no­tices when they ar­rived here.</p>
    <p>Three of the im­ported cases were boys, aged two to three, who had re­turned from In­dia. They tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Satur­day and Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 43 cases an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>One of the newly con­firmed cases is linked to five pre­vi­ous cases to form a new clus­ter at Tuas View Dor­mi­tory at 70 Tuas South Av­enue 1.</p>
    <p>MOH also said it had com­pleted its screen­ing and test­ing of all the peo­ple who vis­ited Jewel Mu­sic Box KTV at HomeTeamNS Khatib on Aug 1 and 2. The KTV was not op­er­a­tional dur­ing the vis­its and there was no singing ac­tiv­ity held.</p>
    <p>The screen­ing and test­ing were done as pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures af­ter three con­firmed Covid-19 pa­tients were found to have vis­ited the KTV on Aug 1 and 2, even though the risk of in­fec­tion for vis­i­tors was as­sessed to be low. In to­tal, 322 peo­ple were tested and all the re­sults have come back neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry yes­ter­day added shop­ping mall Jem to its list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>Yuhua Mar­ket and Hawker Cen­tre in Jurong East and Jurong West 505 Mar­ket and Food Cen­tre were also added to the list yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes to get those who were at th­ese places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks, said MOH. The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid th­ese places as they would have been cleaned, if needed.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks, said MOH.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 423 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 54,572 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 84 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, while 1,706 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care. Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
