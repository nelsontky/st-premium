    <p>• National Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) fans had been wait­ing to see how the Bos­ton Celtics would re­act to their two-game col­lapse down the stretch and the emo­tional out­bursts that fol­lowed in their locker room.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, they played with the “right men­tal­ity”, ac­cord­ing to their coach Brad Stevens, as they clinched a vi­tal 117-106 vic­tory over the Mi­ami Heat to cut the gap in the Eastern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals to 2-1.</p>
    <p>Jaylen Brown scored 26 points and Jayson Ta­tum added 25 points and 14 re­bounds for the Celtics, who avoided fall­ing into an 0-3 hole from which no NBA team have ral­lied to win a best-of-seven se­ries.</p>
    <p>“Down 0-2 i n the se­ries, we played some games we thought we should have played bet­ter,” Brown said. “We wanted to make it an em­pha­sis to come out tonight and play 48 min­utes, and we did.</p>
    <p>“There’s some great guys in that locker room. A lot of emo­tion, a lot of pas­sion, but we’re a fam­ily and we’re here for each other.</p>
    <p>“We ex­em­pli­fied that when we came out to­gether and stayed to­gether dur­ing some tough mo­ments. They made a big run at the end of the sec­ond quar­ter, but we didn’t hang our heads, we kept our will high and per­se­vered.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter their 17-point lead slipped away in a Game 2 loss on Thurs­day – the sec­ond straight game they sur­ren­dered a dou­ble-digit lead – Celtics play­ers could be heard ex­chang­ing heated words.</p>
    <p>But they were all on the same page on Satur­day, dis­play­ing a sense of pur­pose and main­tain­ing their poise as the Heat nar­rowed a 20-point fourth-quar­ter deficit to five with less than a minute to play.</p>
    <p>Mar­cus Smart, a per­fect 10-for-10 from the foul line, pro­duced a string of clutch free throws and the Celtics hung on for the win.</p>
    <p>Cen­tre Bam Ade­bayo led the Heat, who lost for just the sec­ond time in their 12th play-off game, with 27 points, while rookie Tyler Herro scored 22 points and star for­ward Jimmy But­ler scored 17.</p>
    <p>But Bos­ton outscored Mi­ami 60-36 in the paint and held the Heat to 38.8 per cent shoot­ing</p>
    <p>+24 Bos­ton were dom­i­nant in the paint, outscor­ing Mi­ami 60-36.</p>
    <p>from the floor.</p>
    <p>“They came out, Bos­ton did, with great force in this game,” Heat coach Erik Spoel­stra said.</p>
    <p>“You do have to credit them for that. They sus­tained it for the bet­ter ma­jor­ity of the game. We were on our heels most of the game.”</p>
    <p>The Celtics were buoyed by the re­turn from in­jury of Gor­don Hay­ward, who played 30 min­utes off the bench and scored six points with five re­bounds and four as­sists in his first game in over a month.</p>
    <p>Un­like in Game 2, when they were outscored 37-17 in the third quar­ter, Bos­ton main­tained con­trol and en­tered the fourth up 89-74. Ade­bayo trimmed the deficit to five with 55.9 sec­onds to go, but Smart hit eight free throws as the Celtics held on.</p>
    <p>Stevens ac­knowl­edged that his team were chal­lenged emo­tion­ally by their two tough de­feats and Game 3 “was more about what are we go­ing to show our­selves to be”.</p>
    <p>“Our whole team was ag­gres­sive,” he added. “Our whole team played with the right men­tal­ity. Mar­cus did a great job on a guy (Go­ran Dragic) who is play­ing bet­ter than I’ve ever seen him.”</p>
    <p>The Celtics will try to level the se­ries in Game 4 on Wed­nes­day.</p>
