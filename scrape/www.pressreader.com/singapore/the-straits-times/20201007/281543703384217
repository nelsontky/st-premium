    <p>Be­fore he found his niche play­ing killers and scary mon­sters, Amer­i­can ac­tor and stunt­man Derek Mears (be­low) grew up both­ered by his looks. At 1.96m tall, with a deep voice and no body hair due to alope­cia, he is the tit­u­lar mon­ster in the Swamp Thing hor­ror se­ries. He says: “I’m very care­ful to not seem scary, but when I started work­ing in hor­ror, that was when I could step on the gas pedal and re­ally let my scary out.”</p>
    <p>When my hair fell out and my voice grew deeper, I re­alised I was scar­ing peo­ple around me. I’ll be or­der­ing food and the per­son at the cash regis­ter would be scared. My neu­tral face looks like I’m go­ing to mur­der some­body and I never wanted to scare any­one that way.</p>

    <p>Be­fore he found his niche play­ing killers and mon­sters, Amer­i­can ac­tor and stunt­man Derek Mears grew up both­ered by his looks.</p>
    <p>At 1.96m tall, with a deep voice and no body hair due to alope­cia, the 48-year-old ac­tor is the tit­u­lar mon­ster in the hor­ror se­ries Swamp Thing. He says in a video in­ter­view with re­gional press: “When my hair fell out and my voice grew deeper, I re­alised I was scar­ing peo­ple around me.</p>
    <p>“I’ll be or­der­ing food and the per­son at the cash regis­ter would be scared. My neu­tral face looks like I’m go­ing to mur­der some­body and I never wanted to scare any­one that way.</p>
    <p>“I adopted a more an­i­mated per­sona and used a higher regis­ter in my voice, which is very dis­arm­ing. I’m very care­ful to not seem scary but when I started work­ing in hor­ror, that was when I could step on the gas pedal and re­ally let my scary out.”</p>
    <p>In Swamp Thing, a fe­male doc­tor in­ves­ti­gat­ing a swamp-born virus soon meets a mys­te­ri­ous crea­ture. The se­ries, ex­ec­u­tive pro­duced by di­rec­tor James Wan (The Con­jur­ing, 2013), will pre­miere in Asia on Warner TV (StarHub TV Chan­nel 515 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 306) to­day.</p>
    <p>Mears, known for play­ing Jason Voorhees in the 2009 re­boot of hor­ror ti­tle Fri­day The 13th, takes on the role of the DC Comics hu­manoid-plant crea­ture with the help of im­pres­sive pros­thet­ics.</p>
    <p>He says: “I’ve worn so many dif­fer­ent pros­thet­ics and suits through­out my ca­reer but I think this is the best I’ve ever worn. The make-up, the de­sign and ap­pli­ca­tion were ex­tra­or­di­nary. It’s a piece of art.”</p>
    <p>De­spite heavy make-up and a suit that ob­scures how he looks, keep­ing in shape is still vi­tal.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just putting on the suit and go. There’s a lot of train­ing ahead of time – breath­ing tech­niques, study­ing how the suit moves,” he says.</p>
    <p>The ex­is­ten­tial cri­sis and stress faced by his char­ac­ter af­fected Mears’ mood off-screen.</p>
    <p>“When you’re film­ing for three days straight, you’re not just phys­i­cally ex­hausted from be­ing in­side the suit, but also act­ing manic for that en­tire time – your body doesn’t know that you’re act­ing. I told my wife about how hard it was and she laughed and told me that I was so in char­ac­ter that it was start­ing to spill over to my nor­mal life.”</p>
    <p>When the se­ries aired last year in Amer­ica on the stream­ing ser­vice</p>
    <p>DC Uni­verse, Mears heard from many comic book fans.</p>
    <p>He adds: “I got mes­sages from fans of dif­fer­ent sex­ual ori­en­ta­tions and iden­ti­ties who felt a res­o­nance to Swamp Thing be­cause they felt like an out­sider too or felt trapped in­side their own bod­ies.”</p>
    <p>Fan sup­port for the se­ries is strong even though the 10-parter was can­celled abruptly last year soon af­ter its pre­miere, with fans tweet­ing #SaveSwampT­hing in a bid to re­vive the show. Though the se­ries has been picked up for broad­cast rights by The CW net­work, a sec­ond sea­son has not been con­firmed.</p>
    <p>Mears feels the show can be en­joyed as a stand­alone sea­son.</p>
    <p>“It’s more like a 10-hour movie than a 10-episode se­ries. It ties ev­ery­thing up at the end, it’s a solid project.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tor dreams of check­ing off some clas­sic char­ac­ters in the fu­ture, like the DC su­per­hero Blue Devil or the an­tag­o­nist Darth Vader in the Star Wars uni­verse. And though play­ing such char­ac­ters of­ten means Mears is un­recog­nis­able un­der cos­tumes or make-up, he does not mind.</p>
    <p>He says: “The big­gest com­pli­ment for me is when some­one tells me: ‘Oh, I didn’t know you played that guy, I didn’t know it was you.’ Be­cause I don’t want them to re­mem­ber me, I want them to re­mem­ber the char­ac­ter.”</p>
    <p>Swamp Thing premieres to­day at 9.50pm on Warner TV (StarHub TV Chan­nel 515 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 306), with new episodes weekly.</p>
