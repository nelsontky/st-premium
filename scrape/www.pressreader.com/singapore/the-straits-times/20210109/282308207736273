    <p>The Covid-19 out­break did not de­ter On­coCare Cancer Cen­tre staff from walk­ing 8,000km to raise $100,000 for The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund.</p>
    <p>The fund-rais­ing walk was also part of a staff-bond­ing ac­tiv­ity, which took place be­tween Nov 1 and Dec 15 last year.</p>
    <p>Founders of On­coCare, Dr Tay Miah Hiang and Dr Peter Ang, pre­sented a cheque for $100,000 to Ms Tan Bee Heong, gen­eral man­ager of the fund, yes­ter­day at the On­coCare Cancer Cen­tre in Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Founded in 2007, On­coCare is a pri­vate health­care provider that of­fers cancer treat­ment and con­ducts re­search to im­prove the fu­ture of cancer care.</p>
    <p>It treats more than 30,000 pa­tients yearly and cur­rently has seven cen­tres in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Due to the pan­demic, Dr Tay said the com­pany did not hold any staff ac­tiv­i­ties for the whole of last year, “so we thought why not have a fund raiser that fo­cuses on cre­at­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for staff to bond as well”.</p>
    <p>He added: “We came up with Bright Fu­ture Move where staff had to go for walks or runs with col­leagues in groups of three to five, fol­low­ing gov­ern­ment so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, of course.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ang said: “We chose to work with ST School Pocket Money Fund as we be­lieve they will man­age our do­na­tion well and en­sure it reaches those who need it most.”</p>
    <p>For the char­ity cause, staff tracked the dis­tance they cov­ered us­ing run­ning apps on their smart­phones.</p>
    <p>To mo­ti­vate them, in­cen­tives were given to the top three groups and in­di­vid­u­als who cov­ered the most dis­tance, and for the most cre­ative run­ning route.</p>
    <p>Mr Wallace Chai Chung Yee, a staff nurse at On­coCare, topped ev­ery­one by run­ning 800km for the cause.</p>
    <p>“I love run­ning. I feel happy and proud to use my hobby to help those in need,” he said, adding that the staff will take part in sim­i­lar events in the fu­ture and con­tinue to give back to so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The ST fund, which was launched on Chil­dren’s Day on Oct 1, 2000, has since dis­bursed more than $80 mil­lion, help­ing some 180,000 stu­dents from low-in­come fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Ms Tan, the fund raised about $14 mil­lion last year and helped more than 10,000 stu­dents through giv­ing them pocket money and spe­cial pay­outs amid the out­break.</p>
    <p>“We are thank­ful for this timely do­na­tion as we have seen a spike in peo­ple reach­ing out to us for help, es­pe­cially since we are fac­ing a pan­demic,” she said.</p>
