    <p>As the au­thor­i­ties in­ves­ti­gate whether safe dis­tanc­ing rules were breached lead­ing to a fam­ily clus­ter of Covid-19 cases, experts warned that peo­ple should not let their guard down against the virus as Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to re­open.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is still not out of the woods at least un­til a vi­able vac­cine reaches the market, they said.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, said if in­di­vid­u­als or groups de­cide to have their own set of rules, they stand to put the whole community at risk.</p>
    <p>He urged the coun­try to stand united, as if case num­bers rise, the Govern­ment may need to in­crease re­stric­tions again.</p>
    <p>With phase two, which started on June 19, ex­tend­ing be­yond two months, it is also im­por­tant that Sin­ga­pore­ans do not be­come too greedy in want­ing a quicker pace of eas­ing of re­stric­tions, he noted.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing has changed, the virus is still there and we are still vul­ner­a­ble. Peo­ple should be pleased that our num­bers are low and we have good free­doms.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said it was nat­u­ral to have some fa­tigue about rules like wear­ing a mask and so­cial dis­tanc­ing, but this was some­thing the coun­try must tackle col­lec­tively to avoid a resur­gence in the community.</p>
    <p>A re­cent fam­ily clus­ter of five Covid-19 cases from two house­holds is a sign that it is still critical for Sin­ga­pore­ans to con­tinue safe prac­tices, at least un­til there is a vi­able vac­cine, experts cau­tioned yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry said on Sun­day it is in­ves­ti­gat­ing if there were any breaches in safe dis­tanc­ing rules that led to the fam­ily clus­ter.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ingly, Sin­ga­pore­ans have been let­ting their guard down, and gath­er­ings – such as a birth­day cel­e­bra­tion of 20 peo­ple across four ta­bles held in a restau­rant – are not an un­com­mon sight.</p>
    <p>But the grim re­al­ity is that things can get bet­ter slowly and can also get worse very quickly, Pro­fes­sor Dale Fisher, a se­nior in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“The pub­lic needs to have a long­haul view, and if in­di­vid­u­als or groups de­cide to have their own set of rules, they stand to put the whole community at risk.”</p>
    <p>The cur­rent prac­tices of hav­ing no more than five in a group, wear­ing masks and keep­ing a safe dis­tance have served Sin­ga­pore well and kept the coun­try safe, and if peo­ple be­lieved in th­ese prac­tices pre­vi­ously, they should con­tinue to do so and not al­low fa­tigue to set in, Prof Fisher added.</p>
    <p>He said the coun­try needs to re­main united against breaches.</p>
    <p>“If case num­bers rise, the Govern­ment may need to in­crease re­stric­tions and ev­ery­one will lose some free­dom be­cause of a few.”</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health, said: “Un­til we are con­fi­dent that Sin­ga­pore will no longer see chains of community in­fec­tions, in­di­vid­u­als, em­ploy­ers and busi­nesses must con­tinue to keep up the safe man­age­ment mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>He said that the re­cent clus­ter was par­tic­u­larly wor­ry­ing, as at least one of the con­firmed cases was still ac­tive in the community while symp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>All it would take is one un­for­tu­nate in­ci­dent to seed a large clus­ter and ig­nite in­fec­tion chains that lead rapidly to wide­spread community trans­mis­sions. This would need a lot more ef­fort and time to con­tain, he warned.</p>
    <p>As the coun­try ex­per­i­ments with re­lax­ing some bor­der re­stric­tions, there is an even greater need for each in­di­vid­ual to keep his guard up and main­tain dis­ci­pline over mask wear­ing, safe dis­tanc­ing and lim­it­ing large gath­er­ings, he stressed.</p>
    <p>An uptick of community cases lo­cally could also see other coun­tries mak­ing it harder for Sin­ga­pore­ans to travel, Prof Fisher noted.</p>
