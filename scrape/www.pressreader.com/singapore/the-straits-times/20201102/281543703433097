    <p>The ques­tion of whether “mod­ern, post-65 her­itage” build­ings are wor­thy of con­serv­ing may soon be more ob­jec­tively an­swered with a new as­sess­ment tool that is be­ing de­vel­oped by a team from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Cen­tre for Sus­tain­able Asian Ci­ties. The pro­ject will also de­ter­mine the qual­i­ties struc­tures should pos­sess to war­rant state pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional Plaza. Peo­ple’s Park Com­plex. And the Fu Lu Shou Com­plex.</p>
    <p>Con­structed af­ter in­de­pen­dence, th­ese build­ings may have a spe­cial place in Sin­ga­pore’s built her­itage.</p>
    <p>Now the ques­tion of whether they and other “mod­ern, post-65 her­itage” build­ings are wor­thy of con­serv­ing may be more ob­jec­tively an­swered with a new as­sess­ment tool be­ing de­vel­oped by a team from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Cen­tre for Sus­tain­able Asian Ci­ties.</p>
    <p>The pro­ject will also de­ter­mine the qual­i­ties the struc­tures should pos­sess to war­rant state pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Find­ings from the on­go­ing twoyear study, now at its mid­way mark, will help guide pol­i­cy­mak­ing as Sin­ga­pore looks to bet­ter ac­knowl­edge and em­brace lo­cal ar­chi­tec­tural land­marks. To date, shop­houses and black and white bun­ga­lows from the colo­nial era make up a large per­cent­age of the 7,200 build­ings con­served by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times, the team noted the is­land’s lack of a for­malised in­sti­tu­tional ap­proach to ad­dress the mul­ti­ple chal­lenges re­lated to the po­ten­tial con­ser­va­tion of mid-cen­tury mega-struc­tures, many of which are mul­ti­strata and pri­vately owned.</p>
    <p>Bat­tles over a build­ing’s fate can be bit­ter, such as the one over the now de­mol­ished 1976 Pearl Bank Apart­ments de­signed by ar­chi­tect Tan Cheng Siong. A col­lec­tive sale pre­vailed although the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity had deemed it wor­thy of con­ser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Ar­chi­tec­tural con­ser­va­tion spe­cial­ist Ho Weng Hin, the study’s team mem­ber, said: “To pre­vent an­other Pearl Bank type loss, we’re de­vel­op­ing a frame­work and method­ol­ogy such that when an­other sim­i­lar case comes up, we have qual­i­ta­tive and quan­ti­ta­tive in­di­ca­tors to draw from and a panel we can im­me­di­ately con­vene.”</p>
    <p>The study’s re­search ad­viser and for­mer direc­tor of the cen­tre, Dr Lai Choo Mal­one-Lee, said the task was ur­gent. She said: “We’re work­ing towards pre­serv­ing the his­tor­i­cal con­tin­uum of our land­scape from the 60s to the 80s, in this fu­ture city of ours. We can’t pre­serve ev­ery­thing but it’s im­por­tant that we se­lect the right rep­re­sen­ta­tions.”</p>
    <p>Ef­forts also ap­pear to be in­ten­si­fy­ing on the au­thor­i­ties’ end as more such build­ings come of age. On Oct 9, the URA an­nounced its pro­posal to con­serve the mono­lithic Golden Mile Com­plex, de­signed by De­sign Part­ner­ship, or DP Ar­chi­tects, and com­pleted in 1973.</p>
    <p>The as­sess­ment tool be­ing de­vel­oped could in­clude:</p>
    <p>A for­mal round­table and jury with rep­re­sen­ta­tion of all ends of the devel­op­ment and con­ser­va­tion spec­trum where pre-de­fined cri­te­ria will be tabled for dis­cus­sion.</p>
    <p>• An eco­nomic eval­u­a­tion tool to as­sess the costs and long-term vi­a­bil­ity of con­serv­ing such struc­tures.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the team will com­pile an in­ven­tory of build­ings largely re­garded by the ar­chi­tec­tural fra­ter­nity as wor­thy of eval­u­a­tion and con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The study was awarded a her­itage re­search grant from the Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB) last year. Mr Yeo Kirk Siang, NHB’s direc­tor of her­itage re­search and as­sess­ment, said they hope that the pro­ject “will help in­form the work of NHB and other public agen­cies, by pro­vid­ing us a deeper ev­i­dence-based un­der­stand­ing of the is­sues re­lated to the con­ser­va­tion of post-in­de­pen­dence build­ings”.</p>
    <p>The team, which also com­prises her­itage con­ser­va­tion ex­pert Jo­hannes Wi­dodo, from NUS’ Depart­ment of Ar­chi­tec­ture, and ur­ban eco­nomics and real es­tate spe­cial­ist Fu Yum­ing from NUS’ In­sti­tute of Real Es­tate and Ur­ban Stud­ies, will top up their study with a ream of re­search on over­seas leg­is­la­tion and prac­tices in place re­gard­ing the con­ser­va­tion of mod­ernist her­itage struc­tures.</p>
    <p>The study will also fold in views from pro­fes­sion­als in the in­dus­try and mem­bers of the public via fo­cus group ses­sions, which have started and will con­tinue till the year end.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Wi­dodo said: “Sin­ga­pore is not the first coun­try to tackle this mat­ter. It is some­thing a lot of coun­tries in the re­gion are grap­pling with in the wake of eco­nomic pres­sures to tear down post­war icons and mod­ern her­itage struc­tures.”</p>
    <p>CHOOS­ING WHAT TO PRE­SERVE</p>
    <p>We’re work­ing towards pre­serv­ing the his­tor­i­cal con­tin­uum of our land­scape from the 60s to the 80s, in this fu­ture city of ours. We can’t pre­serve ev­ery­thing but it’s im­por­tant that we se­lect the right rep­re­sen­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>DR LAI CHOO MAL­ONE-LEE, the study’s re­search ad­viser and for­mer direc­tor of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Cen­tre for Sus­tain­able Asian Ci­ties.</p>
