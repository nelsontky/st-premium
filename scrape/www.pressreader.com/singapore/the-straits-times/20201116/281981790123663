    <p>In a ca­reer span­ning about 40 years, Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) Pro­fes­sor Den­nis Hugh Mur­phy cre­ated some of the ear­li­est maps of Bukit Timah Na­ture Re­serve and the Mandai man­groves.</p>
    <p>He also had a hand in the de­vel­op­ment of the Sin­ga­pore Zoo’s Frag­ile For­est bio-dome, where vis­i­tors to this day can get up close with in­sects and other an­i­mals in a rain­for­est set­ting.</p>
    <p>On Nov 7, the cel­e­brated Bri­tish zo­ol­o­gist who men­tored a gen­er­a­tion of bi­ol­o­gists in Sin­ga­pore died peace­fully in a nurs­ing home here. He was 89.</p>
    <p>Prof Mur­phy, af­fec­tion­ately known as Paddy, first moved to Sin­ga­pore in 1960 and joined the then Sin­ga­pore cam­pus of the Univer­sity of Malaya as a lec­turer in its Zo­ol­ogy De­part­ment.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times, his for­mer stu­dents said they have fond mem­o­ries of a jovial man who was prac­ti­cal yet gen­er­ous with his time, spon­ta­neous and unortho­dox in his per­spec­tives, and hum­ble de­spite his tow­er­ing con­tri­bu­tions to sci­ence.</p>
    <p>Prof Mur­phy’s key achieve­ments in­clude pi­o­neer­ing work on Sin­ga­pore’s man­grove bio­di­ver­sity in the 70s and 80s.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Peter Ng, head of the Lee Kong Chian Nat­u­ral His­tory Mu­seum at NUS, said the data and in­for­ma­tion Prof Mur­phy col­lected are still used by re­searchers to­day. Prof Ng, 60, was a doc­tor­ate stu­dent un­der Prof Mur­phy in the 80s and later his col­league at the univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Prof Mur­phy’s field of spe­cial­ity was en­to­mol­ogy – the study of in­sects – but he was also a poly­math with wide rang­ing in­ter­ests, said Prof Ng. He cred­its his men­tor with awak­en­ing his own in­ter­est in phi­los­o­phy and his­tory.</p>
    <p>Prof Ng said Prof Mur­phy would of­ten sit out­side the lab­o­ra­tory dur­ing his after­noon breaks with a cof­fee and a cig­a­rette, read­ing a book. He would of­ten get into lengthy dis­cus­sions about what he was read­ing at the time, if any­one asked.</p>
    <p>An­other for­mer stu­dent of Prof Mur­phy, Mr N. Si­va­sothi, 54, is a se­nior lec­turer at the NUS De­part­ment of Bi­o­log­i­cal Sciences known for his re­search on ot­ters.</p>
    <p>Like Prof Ng, Mr Si­va­sothi said some of the most valu­able lessons he learnt from Prof Mur­phy were out­side the class­room.</p>
    <p>Even after his re­tire­ment in 1990, Prof Mur­phy con­tin­ued to be a fix­ture at the NUS labs for nearly a decade more.</p>
    <p>He later served as a con­sul­tant to gov­ern­ment agen­cies and var­i­ous firms in in­sect iden­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Bernard Har­ri­son, 69, who was the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Sin­ga­pore Zoo in the mid-90s, en­listed Prof Mur­phy to help set up the zoo’s Frag­ile For­est.</p>
    <p>“He was very help­ful in cap­tur­ing or ac­quir­ing and dis­play­ing all those lo­cal species of ants, but­ter­flies and in­sects. He may have re­tired but he was still Mr En­to­mol­ogy,” said Mr Har­ri­son.</p>
    <p>Prof Mur­phy’s daugh­ter Juli­ette, who was born and grew up in Sin­ga­pore, said she tried to per­suade her fa­ther to re­turn to Bri­tain with her in his later years, but he adamantly re­fused – Sin­ga­pore was his home, he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Mur­phy, 51, said: “He was for­tu­nate that he had so many friends and for­mer stu­dents who treated him like fam­ily.”</p>
    <p>Prof Mur­phy’s legacy lives on in the sci­en­tific names of more than 100 species of an­i­mals named after him by other ad­mir­ing lo­cal bi­ol­o­gists who dis­cov­ered them. One ex­am­ple is the nudi­branch sea slug, Mur­phy­doris sin­ga­poren­sis, first found</p>
    <p>here in 1991 by Prof Mur­phy’s NUS col­league Jon Sig­urds­son.</p>
    <p>Prof Mur­phy also has a son and grand­daugh­ter. His Sin­ga­porean Chi­nese wife, Dr Mar­guerite YinMur­phy, a mi­cro­bi­ol­o­gist at NUS, died in 2007.</p>
