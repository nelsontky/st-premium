    <p>If you are feel­ing a bit cooped up work­ing from home in your two- or three-bed­room unit, imag­ine how your hori­zon would be fur­ther cur­tailed if your liv­ing space was re­duced by half or more.</p>
    <p>Add an­other home worker – your spouse – and there is bound to be daily jostling on who gets more el­bow space at the din­ing ta­ble. And we have not even talked about the kids yet, as they are bound to want their own play­ing area.</p>
    <p>The work-from-home cul­ture brought about world­wide by the pan­demic has al­ready changed how space is used in com­mer­cial build­ings and shop­ping malls.</p>
    <p>In the United States, for ex­am­ple, de­vel­op­ers of mixed res­i­den­tial and re­tail de­vel­op­ments have started re­plac­ing re­tail space with restau­rants, as more peo­ple are ex­pected to be at home.</p>
    <p>While the use of com­mer­cial space in Sin­ga­pore has yet to see ma­jor changes, re­cent fig­ures of con­do­minium sales here sug­gest work­ing from home is start­ing to in­flu­ence how fam­i­lies choose res­i­den­tial prop­erty.</p>
    <p>The data shows a drop in the de­mand for so-called shoe­box-size apart­ments – those un­der 500 sq ft – in the sec­ond quar­ter. These units ac­counted for only 10 per cent of to­tal new trans­ac­tions, down from 14 per cent in the first quar­ter, when most of­fice work­ers were still on site.</p>
    <p>On the flip side, the de­mand for units 1,200 sq ft and above has risen.</p>
    <p>For the first time since Jan­uary last year, the monthly sales of big­ger units ex­ceeded 100 – hit­ting 112 in June, 125 in July and 151 in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the take-up rate for re­sale con­do­minium units, which are gen­er­ally big­ger than newer ones, has also shot up. There were 112 re­sale condo units sold in June, the month when the cir­cuit breaker ended.</p>
    <p>That shot up in July to 337 and 397 in Au­gust, which was the high­est monthly num­ber since Jan­uary last year, notes Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie.</p>
    <p>She says that as many peo­ple are spend­ing more time work­ing at home, they will cer­tainly start to look at their apart­ments dif­fer­ently, and not just as a place to live and be with their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>“We have no­ticed more peo­ple buy­ing big­ger homes lately and an in­crease in in­quiries for homes in the sub­ur­ban or city fringe ar­eas,” Ms Sun adds.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps these peo­ple are now more acutely aware of the need for a big­ger unit to set up a ded­i­cated workspace or small of­fice at home.”</p>
    <p>As big­ger units tend to be pricier, some peo­ple are mov­ing far­ther out to sub­ur­ban and city fringe ar­eas to find more af­ford­able units. This prob­a­bly ex­plains why the de­mand for re­sale condo units has gone up sig­nif­i­cantly in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Many new condo units are built smaller to make them more af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>Depend­ing on the lo­ca­tion, the price per sq ft of new lease­hold units can eas­ily be over $2,000, mean­ing that a new three-bed­der of about 1,000 sq ft will cost around $2 mil­lion, while two-bed­room units mea­sur­ing 700 sq ft will go for $1.4 mil­lion or so.</p>
    <p>As a com­par­i­son, older lease­hold condo units can have a lower val­u­a­tion of around $800 to $1,200 per sq ft.</p>
    <p>So, even if some­one is look­ing to buy a big­ger unit of about 1,200 sq ft, it will still be cheaper than a new condo unit at $1.44 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>But buy­ing re­sale condo units to live in will of­ten mean set­ting aside a bud­get for ren­o­va­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the over­all cost is still likely to be lower even if you fac­tor in an ex­ten­sive makeover bud­get of $100,000 to $200,000.</p>
    <p>Those who buy big­ger units are likely to have plans to make their homes more com­fort­able for work and play. Ms Sun notes: “Some may also want an ex­tra room or study area to cre­ate a more con­ducive work space to fa­cil­i­tate vir­tual meet­ings or set up more com­plex equip­ment at home.</p>
    <p>“Oth­ers may want to seg­re­gate or cre­ate clearer space bound­aries be­tween work and leisure as the lines could be blur­ring for some in­di­vid­u­als.”</p>
    <p>So, does this mean that units be­low 500 sq ft have lost their shine? It de­pends on the po­ten­tial buyer. Younger Sin­ga­pore­ans who have grown up in more spa­cious Hous­ing Board flats might shy away from such units if they are plan­ning to start a fam­ily.</p>
    <p>That said, smaller units in prime ar­eas in the city cen­tre are likely to still com­mand a premium for Dink (dou­ble in­come, no kids) cou­ples who pre­fer lo­ca­tion over any­thing else.</p>
    <p>Prop­erty an­a­lyst Ong Kah Seng has an­other take on the de­mand for small units. When the pan­demic sub­sides, buy­ers from Hong Kong, who are used to liv­ing in much smaller units, may be keen to look at such apart­ments.</p>
    <p>“More­over, prices of prop­er­ties in Sin­ga­pore are sig­nif­i­cantly lower com­pared with Hong Kong. Even if you in­clude the ad­di­tional stamp duty for for­eign buy­ers, the price is still eas­ily di­gestible,” he says.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, a for­eigner who buys a sub­ur­ban shoe­box condo unit for $700,000 will have to pay an ex­tra $140,000 in stamp duty.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun notes that the work­from-home trend will change the way de­vel­op­ers de­sign new con­do­minium blocks.</p>
    <p>In­stead of build­ing more com­mu­nal fa­cil­i­ties like pav­il­ions and bar­be­cue pits in condo es­tates, they may add co-shar­ing spa­ces such as read­ing and work rooms equipped with Wi-Fi or 5G.</p>
    <p>They may also build more units with study rooms, carve out ded­i­cated spa­ces or cre­ate con­vert­ible ar­eas within the apartment to set up a home of­fice. Dual-key or Soho (small of­fice, home of­fice) units may also gain more pop­u­lar­ity, Ms Sun says.</p>
    <p>Work aside, if you are liv­ing in an older HDB flat or condo unit that is likely quite spa­cious, you may want to think harder about what you need be­fore you up­grade into a new but smaller home.</p>
    <p>Mr S.L. Wong, 54, and his wife used to live in an older condo unit of about 1,100 sq ft be­fore mov­ing two years ago to a fancier unit of about 700 sq ft.</p>
    <p>They im­me­di­ately missed the stor­age space. The cou­ple are golfers but they now have to leave their golf bags in their car as there is not enough space at home.</p>
    <p>“Re­gard­less how good your in­te­rior de­signer is, square feet can’t lie. How­ever, house­work is a breeze,” says Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>They are now look­ing for­ward to mov­ing into a new and big­ger unit of about 1,000 sq ft at the end of the year. Hav­ing learnt from their ex­pe­ri­ence, their new home has a big­ger kitchen, as the pan­demic has re­sulted in them eat­ing at home more of­ten.</p>
    <p>“We also chose a three-bed­room (unit) so we could de­sign one spare room as a walk-in wardrobe to give us suf­fi­cient space to store all our stuff un­der one roof.”</p>
