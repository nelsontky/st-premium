    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Parts of the United States saw record lev­els of high-tide flood­ing l ast year as ris­ing seas brought wa­ter far­ther into coastal homes and in­fra­struc­ture, gov­ern­ment sci­en­tists re­ported on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The in­crease in high-tide flood­ing along the At­lantic and Gulf coasts since 2000 has been “ex­tra­or­di­nary”, the Na­tional Oceanic and At­mo­spheric Ad­min­is­tra­tion (NOAA) re­ported, with the fre­quency of flood­ing in some cities grow­ing five times in that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>That shift is dam­ag­ing homes, im­per­illing the safety of drinking wa­ter, in­un­dat­ing roads and oth­er­wise hurt­ing coastal com­mu­ni­ties, the agency said.</p>
    <p>“Con­di­tions are chang­ing, and not just in a few lo­ca­tions,” said Ms Ni­cole LeBoeuf, act­ing as­sis­tant ad­min­is­tra­tor for NOAA’s Na­tional Ocean Ser­vice, which com­piled the re­port.</p>
    <p>“Dam­ag­ing floods that decades ago hap­pened only dur­ing a storm now hap­pen more reg­u­larly, even with­out se­vere weather.”</p>
    <p>NOAA de­fines high-tide flood­ing, also called sunny-day or nui­sance flood­ing, as wa­ter ris­ing more than half a me­tre above the nor­mal daily high-tide mark.</p>
    <p>The fre­quency of that flood­ing has in­creased be­cause of ris­ing sea lev­els, which were roughly 30cm higher na­tion­ally last year than in 1920.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of days with high­t­ide flood­ing set or tied records in 19 places around the coun­try last year, in­clud­ing Cor­pus Christi, Texas, which recorded 18 days of flood­ing; Galve­ston, Texas (18 days); An­napo­lis, Mary­land (18 days); and Charleston, South Carolina (13 days).</p>
    <p>The place with the great­est num­ber of recorded flood days was</p>
    <p>Ea­gle Point, Texas, in Galve­ston Bay – it re­ported high-tide flood­ing on 64 days, or al­most one in every six days.</p>
    <p>Those num­bers rep­re­sent huge jumps in a short pe­riod. In 2000, Cor­pus Christi had just three days of tidal flood­ing; Charleston had two. The re­port notes that Charleston recorded just 13 days of high­t­ide flood­ing in the more than 50 years that measuremen­ts were first kept – the same num­ber that oc­curred last year alone.</p>
    <p>That trend is likely to ac­cel­er­ate, the agency said.</p>
    <p>By 2030, NOAA pro­jected, the fre­quency of high-tide flood­ing could dou­ble or tre­ble. By 2050, it said, that num­ber could be five to 15 times as great, with the typ­i­cal coastal com­mu­nity flood­ing be­tween 25 and 75 days a year.</p>
    <p>The new data comes as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion con­tin­ues to play down the threat of global warm­ing, which is the driv­ing fac­tor be­hind sea-level rise.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump is pulling the US out of the Paris cli­mate ac­cord, and his of­fi­cials have cited the coro­n­avirus pan­demic in ef­forts to weaken cru­cial en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>“Cli­mate change and car­bon emis­sions are a fac­tor at play when we look at how tides are ris­ing,” said Ms LeBoeuf.</p>
