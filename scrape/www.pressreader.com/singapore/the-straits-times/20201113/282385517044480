    <p>Ath­letes ar­riv­ing in Tokyo for next year’s Olympic Games, post­poned from 2020 be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, will be ex­empt from the 14-day iso­la­tion pe­riod Ja­pan has im­posed on any­one ar­riv­ing from over­seas to help stop the virus spread­ing.</p>
    <p>Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ers said yes­ter­day de­tails still need to be worked out, but mea­sures for ath­letes are likely to in­clude coro­n­avirus test­ing within 72 hours be­fore ar­riv­ing in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>But they warned de­ci­sions on spec­ta­tors from over­seas have yet to be made, say­ing a 14-day quar­an­tine was “im­pos­si­ble”.</p>
    <p>“Ath­letes, coaches and Games of­fi­cials that are el­i­gi­ble for the Tokyo Games will be al­lowed to en­ter the coun­try, pro­vided sig­nif­i­cant mea­sures are made be­fore they get to Ja­pan,” Tokyo 2020 chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Toshiro</p>
    <p>Muto told a news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing af­ter a meet­ing be­tween of­fi­cials from the Tokyo Met­ro­pol­i­tan Gov­ern­ment, the na­tional gov­ern­ment and Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ers on in­fec­tion pre­ven­tion pro­ce­dures dur­ing the Games, which will be held from July 23 to Aug 8.</p>
    <p>He said a de­ci­sion on for­eign spec­ta­tors would be made next year, de­pend­ing on pan­demic de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>“By next spring, we will be com­ing up with a plan for spec­ta­tors, in­clud­ing non-Ja­panese spec­ta­tors,” he said. “It is im­pos­si­ble to set a 14-day quar­an­tine pe­riod for for­eign spec­ta­tors, so tests be­fore and upon ar­rival are needed.”</p>
    <p>If fans are al­lowed into the venues, they may be re­quested not to shout or chant to re­duce the risk of air­borne droplets spread­ing the virus, Muto added, al­though no de­ci­sion has been made yet.</p>
    <p>The no-scream guide­line has been in place for months at Ja­pan’s pro­fes­sional foot­ball and base­ball sta­di­ums.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has held sev­eral re­cent test events, in­clud­ing a four-na­tion gym­nas­tics meet last week­end, in which 2,000 so­cially dis­tanced spec­ta­tors were ad­mit­ted, but these were lim­ited to res­i­dents of Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Muto said he ex­pected de­tails of coro­n­avirus coun­ter­mea­sures to be ironed out dur­ing a four-day visit to Ja­pan by In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) pres­i­dent Thomas Bach next week.</p>
    <p>“It (the trip) is im­por­tant be­cause we are now com­ing to a cru­cial stage of putting this tool­box to­gether with Covid-19 coun­ter­mea­sures to get the feel­ing what will be needed next year,” Bach told a news con­fer­ence on Wed­nes­day, ahead of his Nov 15-18 visit.</p>
    <p>“I hope af­ter this visit we can give even more con­fi­dence to all the par­tic­i­pants of the Games about the safe en­vi­ron­ment they will see in about nine months from now.”</p>
    <p>The IOC and Ja­panese or­gan­is­ers took the un­prece­dented de­ci­sion in March to de­lay the Games by a year to 2021 due to the pan­demic, a costly post­pone­ment that still has many mov­ing parts given the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Bach said it was still too early to say whether spec­ta­tors or even in­ter­na­tional vis­i­tors would be part of the Olympics in July and Au­gust but he be­lieves re­cent events held in Ja­pan such as the gym­nas­tics meet pro­vide con­fi­dence that some fans will be in the are­nas.</p>
    <p>“(The IOC is) more and more con­fi­dent that we will have a rea­son­able num­ber of spec­ta­tors,” he said.</p>
    <p>“How many and un­der which con­di­tions, again, de­pends very much on the fu­ture de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>“The mes­sage I want to de­liver in Tokyo is that we are fully com­mit­ted to the safe or­gan­i­sa­tion of the Games.</p>
    <p>“This is the prin­ci­ple to which we re­main com­mit­ted; that these Games will hap­pen in a safe en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
