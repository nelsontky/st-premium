    <p>WASH­ING­TON Mil­lions of Amer­i­cans have lost their un­em­ploy­ment cov­er­age af­ter United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump re­sisted sign­ing a sweep­ing US$900 bil­lion (S$1.2 tril­lion) aid pack­age un­til law­mak­ers more than tripled the size of re­lief cheques, putting the fate of the mea­sure in limbo.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s re­sis­tance to sign­ing the Bill risks leav­ing mil­lions of un­em­ployed Amer­i­cans with­out cru­cial ben­e­fits, jeop­ar­dises other crit­i­cal as­sis­tance for busi­nesses and fam­i­lies set to lapse at the end of the year, and raises the pos­si­bil­ity of a gov­ern­ment shut­down to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent blind­sided law­mak­ers last week when he de­scribed as “a dis­grace” a re­lief com­pro­mise that over­whelm­ingly passed both Cham­bers and was ne­go­ti­ated by his own Trea­sury Sec­re­tary.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump hinted he might veto the mea­sure un­less law­mak­ers raised the Bill’s US$600 di­rect pay­ment cheques to US$2,000.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent, who was largely ab­sent from ne­go­ti­a­tions over the com­pro­mise, dou­bled down on that crit­i­cism on Satur­day while of­fer­ing lit­tle clar­ity on his plans.</p>
    <p>A White House spokesman de­clined to in­di­cate what Mr Trump in­tended to do. “I sim­ply want to get our great peo­ple US$2,000, rather than the measly US$600 that is now in the Bill,” Mr Trump said on Twit­ter on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den crit­i­cised Mr Trump on Satur­day for re­fus­ing to sign the Bill. Mr Bi­den said that as many as 10 mil­lion peo­ple will lose their un­em­ploy­ment in­surance ben­e­fits amid a pan­demic that has in­fected nearly 19 mil­lion Amer­i­cans and killed more than 331,000.</p>
    <p>About 14 mil­lion peo­ple have been re­ceiv­ing un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits through the Pan­demic Un­em­ploy­ment As­sis­tance and Pan­demic Emer­gency Un­em­ploy­ment Com­pen­sa­tion pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>“It is the day af­ter Christ­mas, and mil­lions of fam­i­lies don’t know if they’ll be able to make ends meet,” Mr Bi­den said. “This ab­di­ca­tion of re­spon­si­bil­ity has dev­as­tat­ing con­se­quences.”</p>
    <p>If Mr Trump does not sign the US$2.3 tril­lion spend­ing pack­age, which in­cludes the US$900 bil­lion in pan­demic aid as well as fund­ing to keep the gov­ern­ment open past to­day, cov­er­age un­der two fed­eral job­less pro­grammes that ex­panded and ex­tended ben­e­fits will have ended on Satur­day for mil­lions of un­em­ployed work­ers.</p>
    <p>The con­se­quences of such a de­lay are dire, said economists, pol­icy ex­perts and law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Some warned that any res­o­lu­tion at this point may be too late for fam­i­lies who will have lost their only life­line shield­ing them from the brunt of the pan­demic’s eco­nomic toll, and will fur­ther bur­den over­whelmed state un­em­ploy­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>“Fore­clo­sures, hunger, home­less­ness, sui­cide,” said Ms Michele Evermore, a se­nior pol­icy an­a­lyst at the Na­tional Em­ploy­ment Law Project, a non-profit work­ers’ rights group. “There will be very per­ma­nent things that hap­pen to peo­ple that can’t be fixed by a cheque in three weeks.”</p>
    <p>Democrats plan to vote to­day on new leg­is­la­tion to cod­ify the US$2,000 pay­ments for most Amer­i­can adults and chil­dren.</p>
    <p>They could also vote on an­other stop­gap mea­sure to fund the gov­ern­ment past the cur­rent spend­ing dead­line of mid­night to­day.</p>
    <p>While that would avert a gov­ern­ment shut­down if the Se­nate also passes it and the Pres­i­dent signs it, it is still un­clear what Mr Trump plans to do with the larger pan­demic re­lief and an­nual spend­ing Bill that Congress passed last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>DEV­AS­TAT­ING CON­SE­QUENCES</p>
    <p>Fore­clo­sures, hunger, home­less­ness, sui­cide. There will be very per­ma­nent things that hap­pen to peo­ple that can’t be fixed by a cheque in three weeks.</p>
