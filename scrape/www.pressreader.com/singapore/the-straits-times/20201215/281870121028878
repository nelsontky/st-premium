    <p>Tai­wan will sub­mit an ap­pli­ca­tion to join the re­vamped ver­sion of the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship once it has fin­ished in­for­mal con­sul­ta­tions with its ex­ist­ing 11 mem­bers, talks which are on­go­ing, the is­land’s For­eign Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>While Tai­wan is a mem­ber of the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion, many coun­tries are wary of sign­ing trade deals with it in fear of ob­jec­tions from China – which claims the is­land as its own ter­ri­tory – even as the demo­cratic gov­ern­ment has sought greater ac­cess to mul­ti­lat­eral deals.</p>
    <p>A tech­nol­ogy pow­er­house, Tai­wan has been an­gling to join the 11-coun­try Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for TransPa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP), which was signed in 2018.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment is­sued late on Sun­day, Tai­wan’s For­eign Min­istry said that ac­cord­ing to the pro­cesses of the CPTPP, new mem­ber ap­pli­cants needed to com­plete in­for­mal talks with ex­ist­ing mem­bers first and “reach a con­sen­sus” be­fore ap­ply­ing.</p>
    <p>Those talks are on­go­ing and mem­ber coun­tries “al­ready clearly un­der­stand our de­ter­mi­na­tion and steps to seek­ing mem­ber­ship, and the at­ti­tude is quite pos­i­tive”, the min­istry said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Once the in­for­mal con­sul­ta­tion with all mem­ber states is com­pleted, we will for­mally sub­mit an ap­pli­ca­tion for mem­ber­ship in ac­cor­dance with the pro­ce­dures,” it added, with­out giv­ing a time­frame.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal 12-mem­ber agree­ment, known as the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship, was thrown into limbo in early 2017 when United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump with­drew.</p>
    <p>It was re­named the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship and links Canada, Aus­tralia, Brunei, Chile, Ja­pan, Malaysia, Mex­ico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>One po­ten­tial prob­lem for Tai­wan could be a par­al­lel ap­pli­ca­tion for mem­ber­ship from China.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said last month that his coun­try would “ac­tively con­sider” sign­ing up for the CPTPP.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi’s com­ments came less than a week af­ter China and 14 other Asia-Pa­cific economies signed the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship in Hanoi to form the world’s largest free-trade bloc.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan is not a mem­ber of that group.</p>
