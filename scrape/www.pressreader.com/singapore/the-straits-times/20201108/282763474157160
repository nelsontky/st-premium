    <p>• Va­len­cia ver­sus Real Madrid is usu­ally one of the big­gest fix­tures in Span­ish foot­ball, but La Liga cham­pi­ons Real will meet a crum­bling in­sti­tu­tion as they look to end their poor re­cent record at the Mestalla to­day.</p>
    <p>Va­len­cia, six-time La Liga cham­pi­ons and Copa del Rey win­ners as re­cently as 2019, are fac­ing fi­nan­cial dif­fi­culty off the pitch and left with an ever-fall­ing num­ber of ex­pe­ri­enced play­ers.</p>
    <p>After fail­ing to make any new sign­ings, the club sold Geoffrey Kon­dog­bia to Atletico Madrid last week, mak­ing the French mid­fielder the sev­enth key player to leave since the end of last sea­son, when they fin­ished ninth.</p>
    <p>They are on track to do worse this term, after tak­ing just eight points from eight games.</p>
    <p>Coach Javi Gra­cia, mean­while, is con­tin­u­ing to lose pa­tience with Sin­ga­porean club owner Peter Lim and pres­i­dent Anil Murthy, say­ing that he is yet to speak to Lim per­son­ally and has hardly any con­tact with Murthy.</p>
    <p>He of­fered his res­ig­na­tion last month but with­drew it, after hear­ing he would have to pay €3 mil­lion (S$4.8 mil­lion) to end his con­tract. He also lashed out at the club for sell­ing Kon­dog­bia be­hind his back.</p>
    <p>“I got a call from the pres­i­dent to tell me the player wasn’t leav­ing, so words fail me,” he said after last week’s 2-2 draw with Getafe.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion has be­come so des­per­ate that for­mer cap­tain David Al­belda is now just cross­ing his fin­gers that the club do not get rel­e­gated.</p>
    <p>Real have won only one of their last six trips to Va­len­cia but head there feel­ing con­fi­dent, after a vi­tal 3-2 win over In­ter Mi­lan in the Cham­pi­ons League on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the team said yes­ter­day that mid­fielder Casemiro and for­ward Eden Haz­ard have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>They added that all other first­team play­ers and coach­ing staff, as well as em­ploy­ees who work di­rectly with them, had re­turned neg­a­tive tests.</p>
