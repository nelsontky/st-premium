    <p>The an­cient city of Wuxi in 1930s China, af­ter the Ja­panese had in­vaded Manchuria in the north and sub­se­quently bombed neigh­bour­ing Shang­hai in the south, was a place of un­cer­tainty and ten­sion.</p>
    <p>A well-re­spected math­e­mat­ics pro­fes­sor fu­ri­ously paced the floor out­side the room where his wife was about to give birth to their fifth child.</p>
    <p>She had al­ready borne him four daugh­ters and the anx­i­ety of pro­duc­ing a son and heir was too much for her to bear. She had a great sense of fore­bod­ing for she knew that if it was not a boy, she would never see the baby again.</p>
    <p>The su­per­sti­tious father had al­ready con­sulted a for­tune teller who had ad­vised that should it be a girl, she should be dis­posed of im­me­di­ately – af­ter which the fam­ily would be blessed with three sons in a row. This was the de­cree of Heaven and not to be taken lightly.</p>
    <p>When the baby was born, the mother sobbed. The young 20-year-old mid­wife turned her back to wash her hands and, in that mo­ment, the fam­ily’s maid slipped the baby out of the room and pre­sented her to the fu­ri­ous father, who picked her up and pro­ceeded to the “ma tong”, or toi­let bowl, where he was ready to drown and throw her away. They would later tell the mother the child had died of nat­u­ral causes.</p>
    <p>The mid­wife ran af­ter him and pleaded with him to give her the baby in­stead and to spare her life. “She has done noth­ing to you. Please give her to me. I will look af­ter her as my own. You will never see her again,” she bravely said.</p>
    <p>The un­happy father ac­qui­esced and the young mid­wife ran home with the squeal­ing baby. It was a coura­geous deed as be­ing a young un­mar­ried woman, she would in­vite scan­dalous gos­sip with the ap­pear­ance of a baby.</p>
    <p>She did not care. She did what she felt was the right thing to do.</p>
    <p>Her father, an an­tique and opium dealer, and her mother, a beau­ti­ful woman with three-inch feet called Black Rose, de­cided that they would help their daugh­ter raise this child.</p>
    <p>Four years later, the mid­wife mar­ried a young doc­tor and they lived to­gether in Wuxi where they brought up the lit­tle girl, giv­ing her every op­por­tu­nity and the love and af­fec­tion they would have given their own.</p>
    <p>As fate would have it, the kind cou­ple were un­able to have their own bi­o­log­i­cal chil­dren. Fate in­deed has a strange way of bal­anc­ing the scales.</p>
    <p>Eleven years af­ter the birth of this lit­tle girl, the mid­wife was called upon to de­liver a baby in Shang­hai. It would be the sev­enth child of the former Miss Shang­hai (whose face adorned cig­a­rette tins and cal­en­dars) and her hus­band, a pow­er­ful tobacco dealer.</p>
    <p>All pre­ced­ing chil­dren had, un­for­tu­nately, been girls and poor Miss Shang­hai was al­ready slightly un­hinged with the in­tense pressure of her in-laws and so­ci­ety to pro­duce a son that would con­tinue the pres­ti­gious fam­ily name.</p>
    <p>The baby was in­deed again a girl, but this time, the mid­wife had come pre­pared. She had that morn­ing vis­ited an or­phan­age, adopted a new­born baby boy and taken him with her. Af­ter the de­liv­ery, she im­me­di­ately swopped the un­wanted girl for the baby boy and pre­sented this de­sired baby to the mother and father.</p>
    <p>They were so deliri­ous with joy that they never no­ticed the mid­wife de­part­ing with the baby girl in a wicker bas­ket. This baby would be­come the lit­tle sis­ter of the pre­vi­ously adopted girl while the boy would be­come the “bao bao”, or “trea­sured baby”, of that il­lus­tri­ous fam­ily. The boy later looked noth­ing like his six sis­ters, but who cared – a son is a son.</p>
    <p>Un­der the lov­ing guid­ance of their adop­tive par­ents, the two sis­ters both grew up to be­come suc­cess­ful pro­fes­sion­als, the el­der be­com­ing a doc­tor and the younger, an ac­coun­tant. The doc­tor sis­ter mar­ried another doc­tor and their first child was born in the au­tumn of 1961.</p>
    <p>At that time, Chi­nese leader Mao Ze­dong’s poli­cies were be­gin­ning to take their toll on the na­tion.</p>
    <p>From 1959, he had em­barked on the purg­ing of high-rank­ing of­fi­cials of ques­tion­able loy­alty from his party and also ini­ti­ated a re­form move­ment that would later be of­fi­cially known as the in­fa­mous Cul­tural Rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Preg­nant with her sec­ond child in 1965, the doc­tor sis­ter was swept up by this move­ment and sent away to a re­mote is­land, Chong­ming Dao, out­side of Shang­hai to be re­formed by farm­ers while her doc­tor hus­band was sim­i­larly de­nounced and sent to Shang­hai No. 1 Steel Fac­tory to be re­formed by the work­ers there. It was the start of a pe­riod of great mis­ery for many Chi­nese that would last till 1976.</p>
    <p>How­ever, af­ter a mishap at work that threat­ened the preg­nancy, the doc­tor sis­ter was luck­ily sent back to Shang­hai to de­liver her child. Once again, the an­gel of their lives, her mid­wife mother ap­peared and, af­ter de­liv­er­ing the baby girl, whisked her away to be cared for un­til the end of this dreaded pe­riod in Chi­nese his­tory when she could be re­united with her par­ents.</p>
    <p>“That baby was me,” said my friend Diana, who was my house guest for a week sev­eral years ago. “My adop­tive granny was the mid­wife and my mum was the baby who had been nearly drowned in the night soil bucket by her own father.”</p>
    <p>I was so mes­merised by her tale that my mouth must have been hang­ing open.</p>
    <p>“My fam­ily story is like a movie, huh?” she asked.</p>
    <p>I could only nod, still try­ing to ab­sorb ev­ery­thing she had said.</p>
    <p>“My an­gel granny lived through World War I, the Ja­panese in­va­sion and World War II, the Civil War, the Lib­er­a­tion War, the Great Chi­nese Famine (1959-61) and, fi­nally, nine years of the Cul­tural Rev­o­lu­tion,” she con­tin­ued. “Her whole life was so painful and tur­bu­lent, and yet she had so much love to save all of us and give us a warm and lov­ing fam­ily. I con­sider my­self so blessed.”</p>
    <p>I could barely be­lieve it as</p>
    <p>I looked at my friend across the din­ing ta­ble, her stun­ning beauty il­lu­mi­nat­ing the room. It was hard to imag­ine the painful twists and turns she and her fam­ily had en­dured th­ese past 80 years.</p>
    <p>I shud­dered to think of how many un­wanted baby girls in China must have been dis­posed of in this sense­less way and the ag­o­nis­ing de­spair of the help­less moth­ers who had to yield their flesh and blood to this age-old tra­di­tion. I felt so sad.</p>
    <p>All I know is I would have been the hap­pi­est and proud­est father in the world if I had had seven daugh­ters.</p>
