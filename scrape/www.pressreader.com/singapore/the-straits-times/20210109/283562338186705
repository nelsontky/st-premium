    <p>When Sin­ga­pore moved into the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in April last year, piv­ot­ing to a hy­brid model of teach­ing be­came the new re­al­ity for teach­ers and stu­dents.</p>
    <p>And Ms De­siree Ang was no ex­cep­tion. With schools closed, the Chi­nese lan­guage teacher at Jurong Pri­mary School had to come up with in­no­va­tive ways to cre­ate mean­ing­ful lessons for home-based learn­ing (HBL).</p>
    <p>She recorded videos of her­self teach­ing, added pic­tures and an­i­ma­tions to her Pow­erPoint slides and also lever­aged the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion’s (MOE) on­line plat­form Stu­dent Learn­ing Space to pose ques­tions to pupils so she could assess if they un­der­stood her videos.</p>
    <p>In spite of lessons go­ing on­line and the dis­rup­tions to ev­ery­one’s lives, what does not change is a teacher’s love and pas­sion for her pupils and the pro­fes­sion. For Ms Ang, HBL also al­lowed her to put into prac­tice her phi­los­o­phy of “teach­ing with em­pa­thy”, a be­lief shaped by her ex­pe­ri­ence dur­ing a teach­ing at­tach­ment in Swe­den in her un­der­grad­u­ate years, as part of the NTU-NIE Teach­ing Schol­ars Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>“Many stu­dents at the school I was at­tached to were im­mi­grants who came from com­plex back­grounds. The teach­ers in the school were able to em­pathise with them and were con­stantly find­ing ways to help them over­come their dif­fi­cul­ties,” she says.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, dur­ing HBL, Ms Ang tried to sup­port her pupils re­motely by cre­at­ing an on­line space that al­lowed her to check in on their well-be­ing. When schools re­opened, she con­tin­ued to keep tabs on their progress.</p>
    <p>“Ini­tially, they were re­luc­tant to share about their strug­gles,” she says. “But af­ter some ef­fort and per­se­ver­ance, they opened up, and I was able to pro­vide them with the sup­port they needed.”</p>
    <p>An un­wa­ver­ing pas­sion</p>
    <p>Ms Ang joined the ed­u­ca­tion ser­vice fol­low­ing her own pos­i­tive ex­pe­ri­ence as a stu­dent.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing an in­tro­vert, she was given the op­por­tu­nity by her teacher to em­cee at school events and join the stu­dent council.</p>
    <p>Her teacher sup­ported her through this jour­ney of self-discovery as she grad­u­ally broke out of her shy per­son­al­ity. In­spired by her teacher’s be­lief in her, she re­alised that she, too, wanted to make a dif­fer­ence in chil­dren’s lives.</p>
    <p>Her love for the Chi­nese lan­guage stems from her fam­ily, who ex­posed her to Chi­nese cul­ture from a young age. Dur­ing a re­lief teach­ing stint, she no­ticed that many stu­dents felt the lan­guage</p>
    <p>I chose to be­come a Chi­nese lan­guage teacher be­cause of my un­wa­ver­ing pas­sion for the lan­guage, and I want to pass this on to fu­ture gen­er­a­tions. Ms De­siree Ang, Chi­nese lan­guage teacher, Jurong Pri­mary School</p>
    <p>“was dif­fi­cult and that they were un­in­ter­ested in learn­ing it”.</p>
    <p>This made Ms Ang all the more de­ter­mined to mas­ter the lan­guage and teach it, which led her to pur­sue a de­gree in Chi­nese</p>
    <p>Lan­guage and Lit­er­a­ture at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity un­der an MOE Teach­ing Award.</p>
    <p>“I chose to be­come a Chi­nese lan­guage teacher be­cause of my un­wa­ver­ing pas­sion for the lan­guage, and I want to pass this on to fu­ture gen­er­a­tions,” she says.</p>
    <p>To those con­sid­er­ing teach­ing, Ms Ang says: “You hold a key that can make a dif­fer­ence in some­one else’s life. Go for it!”</p>
