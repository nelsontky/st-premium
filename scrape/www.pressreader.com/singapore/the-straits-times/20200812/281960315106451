    <p>A 26-year-old man was sen­tenced yes­ter­day in the High Court to 10 years and 10 weeks in jail, as well as six strokes of the cane, af­ter he pleaded guilty to statu­tory rape.</p>
    <p>The court heard that he met a 12-year-old girl through an on­line chat app called BeeTalk in Septem­ber 2017 and sub­se­quently had sex with her twice within the week.</p>
    <p>He also ad­mit­ted to post­ing nude pho­to­graphs of two for­mer girl­friends, aged 23 and 25, on so­cial net­work­ing site Tum­blr be­tween 2015 and 2017.</p>
    <p>He pleaded guilty to one charge of statu­tory rape and two charges of trans­mit­ting ob­scene ma­te­rial. Two other charges – for statu­tory rape and sex­ual ex­ploita­tion of a child – were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The man can­not be named ow­ing to a gag or­der to pro­tect the vic­tims’ iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors said the ac­cused dis­played preda­tory con­duct by be­friend­ing the 12-year-old vic­tim on BeeTalk and im­me­di­ately sex­u­ally groom­ing her by send­ing her lewd mes­sages and en­cour­ag­ing her to have sex with him.</p>
    <p>The court was told that the man, among other things, asked the vic­tim on the day they be­came ac­quainted if she “played games”.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim thought he meant mo­bile phone games, but the ac­cused quickly dis­pelled this no­tion and ini­ti­ated highly sex­u­ally charged mes­sages, which court doc­u­ments said were wholly in­ap­pro­pri­ate for a 12-year-old.</p>
    <p>They had their first meet-up the next day, Sept 14, 2017. The man had cho­sen a se­cluded spot to have sex with the girl on the third-floor stair­well at Leng Kee Com­mu­nity Club in Red­hill.</p>
    <p>He had sex with her again on the morn­ing of Sept 18, 2017, at her home when she skipped school and no­body was home.</p>
    <p>That even­ing, the vic­tim’s mother con­fis­cated her mo­bile phone and found sex­u­ally ex­plicit mes­sages from the ac­cused ask­ing for nude pho­to­graphs.</p>
    <p>The next day, the vic­tim’s mother and her aunt in­formed the girl’s school be­fore a po­lice re­port was made.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions, the man ad­mit­ted that he was aware that hav­ing sex with a per­son un­der the age of 14 was an of­fence.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the court heard that the 23-year-old vic­tim had been in a re­la­tion­ship with the man in 2010 but they had bro­ken up shortly af­ter. Af­ter a nude pic­ture of the vic­tim was found on his phone dur­ing po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions, he ad­mit­ted to hav­ing up­loaded two nude pic­tures of her.</p>
    <p>As for the 25-year-old vic­tim, she was still in a re­la­tion­ship with the man when he up­loaded eight nude pho­to­graphs of her be­tween Fe­bru­ary and March 2017.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion told the court that the man caused un­told dis­tress and hu­mil­i­a­tion to the vic­tims when they dis­cov­ered the posts.</p>
    <p>The court was told that the man, among other things, asked the vic­tim on the day they be­came ac­quainted if she “played games”. The vic­tim thought he meant mo­bile phone games, but the ac­cused quickly dis­abused her of this no­tion and ini­ti­ated highly sex­u­ally charged mes­sages which court doc­u­ments said were wholly in­ap­pro­pri­ate for a 12-year-old.</p>
