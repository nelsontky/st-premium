    <p>The Old Changi Hos­pi­tal (OCH) in Old Hal­ton Road, which was built in 1935, was used as a prison camp dur­ing World War II. It was also ru­moured to be used by the Ja­panese im­pe­rial po­lice, the Kem­peitai, as a tor­ture cham­ber. The premises have been va­cant since 1997. Mr Boyd says this is prob­a­bly the “most haunted” lo­ca­tion in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing one of my in­ves­ti­ga­tions, we were in the former chil­dren’s wing and com­mu­ni­cated with an en­tity named An­drew,” says Mr Boyd, who uses de­vices such as ther­mal sen­sors, dig­i­tal cam­eras with high-pow­ered lamps, night-vi­sion gog­gles and elec­tro­mag­netic field me­ters to “de­tect” other-worldly en­ti­ties. “He seemed harm­less and stuck around for a while to an­swer a few of our ques­tions through one of our de­vices.”</p>
    <p>Mr Boyd says for one of his Haunted Hour pod­casts, a new series he started in April on Face­book, he in­ter­viewed a former staff nurse, Jessy Kaur, who worked at OCH from 1991 to 1997.</p>
    <p>“Right from her first day on the job, she was haunted by an en­tity at about 2am that called out her sur­name, ‘Kaur’,” says Mr Boyd. “Till to­day, it has been one of the most pop­u­lar episodes in the series.”</p>
    <p>Parts of the hos­pi­tal are now closed to the pub­lic.</p>
