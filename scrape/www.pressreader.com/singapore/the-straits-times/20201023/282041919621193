    <p>A se­cret so­ci­ety mem­ber re­peat­edly slashed a youth with a knife in a brawl that took place in Chi­na­town on May 10.</p>
    <p>A video of the in­ci­dent, which was cap­tured on closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion, was widely shared on so­cial me­dia and What­sApp group chats.</p>
    <p>It shows two groups of peo­ple fight­ing in a cor­ri­dor on the 16th storey of Peo­ple’s Park Cen­tre, Block 101 Up­per Cross Street.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim, Muhammed Shazryl Hykel Ab­dul­lah, 19, sus­tained in­juries, in­clud­ing slash wounds on his back, and was rushed to Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>Noor Na­jat Alwi – one of his at­tack­ers – pleaded guilty in a district court yes­ter­day to two counts of ri­ot­ing while armed with a deadly weapon and be­ing a mem­ber of an un­law­ful so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, who will turn 21 to­mor­row, also ad­mit­ted to an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker from April 7 to June 1, peo­ple were not al­lowed to leave their homes with­out a valid rea­son or meet oth­ers from dif­fer­ent house­holds to so­cialise.</p>
    <p>The court heard that a man iden­ti­fied as Muham­mad Roslan Mo­hamed Rumli, 28, and his girl­friend, known only as Kira, met an­other woman, called Akai, in Selegie Road on May 8.</p>
    <p>Kira later ac­com­pa­nied Akai home, and Roslan video-called his girl­friend the next day. He no­ticed that Kira be­haved “sus­pi­ciously” and re­fused to re­veal her where­abouts. Shortly after, some­body snatched away her phone and ended the call.</p>
    <p>Roslan called Akai, who told him that she had been with Kira at the Peo­ple’s Park Cen­tre flat with a group that in­cluded Hykel. Akai claimed that one of the peo­ple in the group later chased her out of the flat for an un­known rea­son, and she left Kira be­hind.</p>
    <p>Wor­ried, Roslan con­tacted his friends, in­clud­ing Noor. Their group of five ar­rived at the flat at around 3am on May 10. Akai later texted Roslan a per­sonal iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­ber to key in at the door, and his group en­tered the unit.</p>
    <p>They as­saulted two men who were in­side, and one of the two used his phone to tell Hykel, who was out, about what was hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>Hykel gath­ered his friends, and his group, which was also made up of five men, ar­rived at the unit at around 3.30am. A brawl soon broke out be­tween the two groups.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Jas­min Kaur said that dur­ing the brawl, Noor slashed Hykel with a knife be­fore flee­ing the scene.</p>
    <p>The cases in­volv­ing Roslan, Hykel and sev­eral other al­leged of­fend­ers linked to the case are still pend­ing.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Deputy Prin­ci­pal District Judge Seah Chi-Ling called for re­ports to as­sess Noor’s suit­abil­ity for re­for­ma­tive train­ing and pro­ba­tion. He will be sen­tenced on Nov 12.</p>
    <p>Noor Na­jat Alwi pleaded guilty in a district court yes­ter­day to two counts of ri­ot­ing while armed with a deadly weapon and be­ing a mem­ber of an un­law­ful so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, who will turn 21 to­mor­row, also ad­mit­ted to an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
