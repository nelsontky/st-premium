    <p>The quirky plot of Love­craft Coun­try – which has scored a per­fect 100 per cent on re­view-ag­gre­ga­tion site Rot­ten Toma­toes – jux­ta­poses killer mon­sters with the hor­rors of racism.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times and other press in Zoom in­ter­views re­cently, the creator and stars of the new drama se­ries – pro­duced by film-mak­ers Jor­dan Peele (Get Out, 2017) and J.J. Abrams (Star Wars: The Rise Of Sky­walker, 2019) – dis­cuss how its oth­er­worldly ele­ments can add to peo­ple’s un­der­stand­ing of sys­temic big­otry.</p>
    <p>De­but­ing on HBO Go to­day at 9am and 10pm, the story fol­lows a young black man, At­ti­cus Free­man (Jonathan Ma­jors), as he takes a road trip with his un­cle Ge­orge (Court­ney B. Vance) and child­hood friend Leti­tia (Jurnee Smol­lett) in search of his miss­ing fa­ther.</p>
    <p>The jour­ney is fraught with dan­ger as they not only en­counter the su­per­nat­u­ral, but are also forced to travel through un­friendly towns with racial-seg­re­ga­tion laws.</p>
    <p>The show’s c r e a t o r , Mi s h a Green, says “the mon­sters are a metaphor for the racism that’s al­ways been (present) in Amer­ica and even glob­ally”.</p>
    <p>And hor­ror or sci­ence fic­tion “works best when it is the metaphor on top of the real-life emo­tions and the real-life prob­lems that you ex­plore”, adds the 35-year-old, who cre­ated the slav­ery drama Un­der­ground (2016 to 2017) and wrote for su­per­hero show He­roes (2006 to 2010).</p>
    <p>Ma­jors, 30, says the story’s racist hu­mans are just as scary as the mon­sters, if not more so.</p>
    <p>“In my opin­ion, a mon­ster is a mon­ster. A mon­ster is some­thing that is driven by a sys­tem that ter­rorises or de­stroys.”</p>
    <p>But, he ob­serves, “it’s quite dif­fer­ent when that mon­ster is dis­guised in the same body as you and the only thing that’s dif­fer­ent is the skin colour”.</p>
    <p>That makes it more of a “men­tal and psy­cho­log­i­cal” threat, says the ac­tor, who starred in the drama The Last Black Man In San Fran­cisco (2019).</p>
    <p>In some ways, the big­ots on the show “are that much more ter­ri­fy­ing than a shog­goth or Cthulhu”, he adds, re­fer­ring to two su­per­nat­u­ral cre­ations from the writ­ings of au­thor H.P. Love­craft, who in­spired the source ma­te­rial for the se­ries, a 2016 fan­tasy novel by Matt Ruff.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing in any marginalis­ed group in this very pow­er­ful coun­try is quite ter­ri­fy­ing. It’s some­thing (the char­ac­ters) deal with, and that I and my broth­ers and sis­ters have dealt with,” Ma­jors ex­plains.</p>
    <p>In­tro­duc­ing fic­ti­tious mon­sters to the tale also serves as a “kind of a short­cut” so the au­di­ence can un­der­stand what it is like to con­front racism, he adds. “It’s, like, ‘This is ac­tu­ally what it is like’, in case you don’t know.”</p>
    <p>And the scares in the story will plug into vis­ceral fears that ev­ery­one has.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause we all be­lieve in mon­sters, whether you want to say it or not. When you’re a kid, it is the bo­gey­man un­der the bed, then it be­comes your ex-girl­friend or your prin­ci­pal,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Then some­how, we lose that, but in the show we’ve brought it back, and it makes it that much more im­me­di­ate and uni­ver­sal.”</p>
    <p>Smol­lett, who plays the spir­ited Leti­tia, says the he­roes of Love­craft Coun­try “are es­sen­tially go­ing on a quest to bring down white supremacy”.</p>
    <p>“And we are still on that quest to­day, in 2020, as black Amer­i­cans,” says the 33-year-old, who ap­peared in the su­per­hero film Har­ley Quinn: Birds Of Prey ear­lier this year. dis­tinct from one an­other, yet shar­ing a deep in­vest­ment in mu­sic as both a salve and a com­pass for their com­pli­cated self-mak­ing jour­neys. Sadly, but not sur­pris­ingly, Hulu can­celled High Fi­delity this month.</p>
    <p>Black fe­male mu­sic fans are the lis­ten­ers who have con­sis­tently shown love for black fe­male artists – the mu­si­cians who have pro­vided cru­cial DNA for pop mu­sic but who have rarely had con­trol over how their records are pro­duced and pro­moted be­cause of un­re­lent­ing racism and sex­ism.</p>
    <p>Black women will make their voices heard in the bl­o­go­sphere and on Twit­ter and In­sta­gram. They will be there to hold the Grammy Awards ac­count­able when Bey­once’s Lemon­ade is snubbed or when Nicki Mi­naj keeps it real with Tay­lor or Miley, re­mind­ing both su­per­stars how racism and priv­i­lege op­er­ate in their own ca­reers. These fan war­riors are part</p>
    <p>“Be­cause racism is such a de­monic spirit, it’s some­thing that we are still fight­ing off.”</p>
    <p>Like Ma­jors, she be­lieves that the mon­ster of racism is much harder to fight than any Love­craftian one.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress says: “The un­for­tu­nate thing about the spir­i­tual war­fare our char­ac­ters are en­gaged with in bring­ing down racism is that you don’t re­ally know where it’s com­ing from. And that is some­times even more of a threat be­cause it’s un­ex­pected, it af­fects your liveli­hood and it af­fects your pur­suit of hap­pi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Smol­lett adds: “It’s the iso­la­tion and trauma you ex­pe­ri­ence on so many lev­els when you re­alise that Amer­ica has not evolved a place for you.</p>
    <p>“With a mon­ster, you kind of just have to outrun it.” of a legacy that stretches back 100 years.</p>
    <p>Mamie Smith’s achieve­ment not only made way for the Bil­lies, Arethas, Whit­neys and Bey­onces who fol­lowed her path to pop dom­i­nance, but she also changed pre­sump­tions about what pop­u­lar mu­sic was, what it could do – what kind of lan­guage it could speak to us about the depth and in­tri­ca­cies of our in­ner lives. Her record hailed us and we re­sponded by car­ry­ing it into the cen­tre of our lives and the in­ti­macy of our homes, build­ing en­tire life worlds around it, sound fortresses to re­sist the catas­tro­phe of our chronic in­vis­i­bil­ity.</p>
