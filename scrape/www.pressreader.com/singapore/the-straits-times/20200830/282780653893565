    <p>Chi­nese ne­ti­zens are fond of com­ing up with nick­names for well­known per­son­al­i­ties, and US pres­i­dents are not spared.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Donald Trump has been known as “chuanpu”, which is a translit­er­a­tion of his last name, but also means Chi­nese spo­ken with a Sichuan ac­cent.</p>
    <p>At one point, he was also re­ferred to as “chuang po”, an­other ren­der­ing of his last name, which lit­er­ally means “break­ing bed”.</p>
    <p>But the lat­est moniker that the Chi­nese have be­stowed on him has stuck and spread across the coun­try, an in­di­ca­tion of its res­o­nance with the peo­ple.</p>
    <p>He’s now reg­u­larly called “chuan</p>
    <p>jian­guo”, or “na­tion-build­ing Trump”, for his per­ceived con­tri­bu­tions to China’s de­vel­op­ment, much like the nearly one mil­lion peo­ple named “jian­guo” in China, of whom 24 per cent were born in the first decade af­ter the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party came to power, based on data from the Na­tional Cit­i­zen Iden­tity In­for­ma­tion Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The hawk­ish Global Times edi­tor-in-chief Hu Xi­jin tweeted in May that the Chi­nese “wish for your re-elec­tion be­cause you can make Amer­ica ec­cen­tric and thus hate­ful for the world. You help pro­mote unity in China and you also make (in­ter­na­tional) news as fun as com­edy”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump may have launched a bruis­ing trade war against China, gone af­ter its tech com­pa­nies and govern­ment of­fi­cials, and brought Sino-US re­la­tions to the brink of col­lapse, but some within the Chi­nese lead­er­ship be­lieve an­other four years of a tu­mul­tuous re­la­tion­ship could serve Bei­jing bet­ter than a Demo­crat in the White House.</p>
    <p>“Trump is de­stroy­ing the US, and, from a strate­gic point of view, China would want to max­imise its own in­ter­est and min­imise US in­ter­est, and Trump is help­ing to do that,” says a source fa­mil­iar with the Chi­nese lead­er­ship’s think­ing who de­clined to be named be­cause of a re­cent gag or­der from the govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with Mr Trump, who has in­creas­ingly been cast by Chi­nese state me­dia as hav­ing gone off his rocker, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping is seen as be­ing above the fray and busy with tend­ing to do­mes­tic af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Po­lit­i­cal pun­dits have all de­duced that Bei­jing prefers Demo­crat nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den for a more ra­tio­nal, al­though no less tough, en­gage­ment with China.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese ne­ti­zens have also made less of a mock­ery of him in their choice of his nick­name: “Bai zhen</p>
    <p>hua”. Mr Bi­den’s Chi­nese name has been trans­lated as “baideng”, while zhen­hua is a trun­ca­tion of “zhenxin</p>
    <p>zhonghua”, a revo­lu­tion­ary slo­gan which means “to re­vi­talise China”.</p>
    <p>The rea­son: Mr Bi­den had dur­ing his elec­tion cam­paign been us­ing a fa­mous dic­tum by Mao Ze­dong.</p>
    <p>“Women hold up half the sky,” Mr Bi­den has said in in­ter­views and speeches, such as when asked why he picked Ms Ka­mala Har­ris as his run­ning mate.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese of­fi­cials have been care­ful not to be drawn into dis­cussing the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion or the two can­di­dates, main­tain­ing over the months that China is not in­ter­ested in med­dling in US in­ter­nal af­fairs, just as it rou­tinely tells off the US for in­ter­fer­ing in China’s do­mes­tic is­sues to do with Hong Kong, Tai­wan and Xin­jiang.</p>
    <p>On Friday, For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian, when asked to com­ment on Mr Trump’s as­ser­tion dur­ing his Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­gress speech that China will “own” the US if Mr Bi­den wins the elec­tion, urged again for bi­lat­eral re­la­tions to get “back to the right track”.</p>
    <p>Says As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Al­fred Wu of the Lee Kuan Yew School of</p>
    <p>Pub­lic Pol­icy: “The Chi­nese think Bi­den is a much more po­lit­i­cally able per­son, and he will lessen the ten­sion.”</p>
    <p>Those with an in­ter­na­tional per­spec­tive will un­der­stand that a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion may pose a greater strate­gic threat to China as it seeks to re­in­state Amer­ica’s global lead­er­ship and in­ter­est in mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, while forg­ing an al­liance of like-minded na­tions to con­tain China.</p>
    <p>But Prof Wu be­lieves many se­nior of­fi­cials and pub­lic in­tel­lec­tu­als in China do not quite grasp or care about the sour­ing in­ter­na­tional pub­lic opin­ion on it, and are thus ill pre­pared for both Trump and Bi­den lead­er­ships.</p>
    <p>“From China’s point of view, only when it strength­ens its eco­nomic power will it not be sub­jected to bul­ly­ing any more. When my eco­nomic size is closer to yours, you will be more friendly to­wards me. This mind­set is very clear.”</p>
