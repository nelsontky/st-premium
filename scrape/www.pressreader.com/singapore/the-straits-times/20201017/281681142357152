    <p>Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong have adopted dif­fer­ent so­cial dis­tanc­ing norms to curb the Covid-19 pan­demic. Here is a look at the rules im­ple­mented by the au­thor­i­ties at present. Any changes will be sub­ject to fu­ture an­nounce­ments.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE’S RULES</p>
    <p>• It is manda­tory for ev­ery­one to wear a mask when they are out­side their homes. Only those en­gag­ing in stren­u­ous ex­er­cise or eat­ing and drink­ing can re­move their masks. But they must mask up promptly when done.</p>
    <p>• All in­di­vid­u­als are re­quired to keep a dis­tance of at least 1m from one another in pub­lic. • So­cial gath­er­ings of up to five peo­ple are al­lowed, and they can be from dif­fer­ent house­holds. The num­ber of vis­i­tors to a house­hold is also capped at five. House­holds with more than five peo­ple can go out to­gether, but they are not al­lowed to sit in groups big­ger than five at food and bev­er­age out­lets.</p>
    <p>Shop­ping cen­tres, F&B out­lets and cine­mas must have tem­per­a­ture checks at en­trances. Night­clubs re­main closed.</p>
    <p>The sale and con­sump­tion of liquor is not al­lowed at F&B out­lets af­ter 10.30pm.</p>
    <p>Cine­mas have ca­pac­ity lim­its.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, large cin­ema halls</p>
    <p>with more than 300 seats can ad­mit up to 150 pa­trons.</p>
    <p>Places of in­ter­est can ap­ply to scale up their ca­pac­ity lim­its to 50 per cent, up from 25 per cent since they re­sumed op­er­a­tions on July 1. At­trac­tions now also have on­line book­ing sys­tems to con­trol vis­i­tor num­bers.</p>
    <p>The crowd limit at most places of wor­ship at any one time is 100 peo­ple with seg­mented zones to re­duce in­ter­ac­tions. Re­li­gious classes are capped at 50 peo­ple. Penal­ties: In­di­vid­u­als have been fined $300 for flout­ing Covid-19 rules such as not wear­ing masks af­ter eat­ing and be­ing in groups of more than five. F&B out­lets have been or­dered to close for 10 days and oth­ers fined up to $2,000 for breach­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Gen­er­ally, those who break Covid-19 rules can be fined up to $10,000, jailed up to six months, or both. Re­peat of­fend­ers’ penal­ties can be dou­bled.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG’S RULES TILL OCT 22</p>
    <p>It is manda­tory to wear masks in pub­lic and on pub­lic trans­porta­tion such as trains, buses and cabs. Face masks do not have to be worn in out­door pub­lic places in coun­try parks or when ex­er­cis­ing. The penalty for breach­ing this rule is a fine of between HK$2,000 (S$350) and HK$5,000.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic gath­er­ings con­tinue to be capped at four peo­ple dur­ing this pe­riod. Of­fend­ers are li­able to a max­i­mum fine of HK$25,000 and im­pris­on­ment for six months.</p>
    <p>Those who take part in pro­hib­ited group gath­er­ings may dis­charge li­a­bil­ity for the of­fence by pay­ing a fixed penalty of HK$2,000.</p>
    <p>Eater­ies and restau­rants can of­fer dine-in ser­vices from 5am till mid­night. There is a cap of four pa­trons per ta­ble, and ta­bles have to be kept 1.5m apart. Eater­ies are to op­er­ate at 50 per cent ca­pac­ity. Bars and pubs have re­opened with two pa­trons per ta­ble al­lowed. Live per­for­mances and danc­ing are still not per­mit­ted. Masks have to be worn at all times within any res­tau­rant, bar or pub ex­cept when the per­son is con­sum­ing food or drink. Pa­trons get their tem­per­a­ture taken be­fore en­ter­ing the premises.</p>
    <p>Amuse­ment game cen­tres, gyms, leisure venues such as bowl­ing al­leys and bil­liard halls, cine­mas, party rooms, beauty and mas­sage par­lours, karaoke lounges and mahjong houses are open but gen­eral rules ap­ply, in­clud­ing the manda­tory wear­ing of masks. Cin­ema op­er­a­tions are capped at 75 per cent of the seat­ing ca­pac­ity. Ta­bles at night­clubs are capped at two pa­trons and no live per­for­mances or danc­ing are per­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>Re­li­gious gath­er­ings are al­lowed at a venue’s 50 per cent over­all ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment will re­view and tweak the mea­sures as it sees fit on a weekly ba­sis.</p>
