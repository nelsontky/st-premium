    <p>The for­merly thriv­ing pop con­cert in­dus­try, hard hit by re­stric­tions, will take another small step closer to re­claim­ing its pre-pan­demic buzz with a two-day show at the Sands The­atre at Ma­rina Bay Sands on Dec 18 and 19.</p>
    <p>Ti­tled Back To Live, the two gigs will be the big­gest mu­sic event with a live au­di­ence since mea­sures to curb the pan­demic kicked in, with 500 tick­ets avail­able each night.</p>
    <p>The 9pm shows will fea­ture per­for­mances by home-grown artists. Singers Ben­jamin Kheng, Sezairi, Narelle, Liny­ing and rap­per TheLion City Boy will per­form on the first night. The sec­ond show will fea­ture singers Char­lie Lim, Aisyah Aziz and Keyana.</p>
    <p>The con­certs, sup­ported by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB), also mark the re­open­ing of the Sands The­atre, which can hold up to 2,155 guests, since it closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>To en­sure the event is safe, all con­cert­go­ers will have to abide by sev­eral reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>As part of the Min­istry of Health’s pi­lot for large-scale events with pre-event test­ing, the shows will re­quire each au­di­ence mem­ber to have a neg­a­tive anti­gen rapid or poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test re­sult.</p>
    <p>Anti­gen rapid tests are free for ticket buy­ers. Those buy­ing two­day tick­ets for both con­certs, which cost $98, can take the free tests at the venue from 5.30pm to 7.30pm be­fore each show, or at des­ig­nated clinics.</p>
    <p>Those buy­ing sin­gle-night tick­ets, which cost $55, have to take the free tests at des­ig­nated clinics.</p>
    <p>Tests at the clinics have to be done on the morn­ing of the show, or no ear­lier than 11pm on the night be­fore the show.</p>
    <p>Those who are un­able to at­tend the con­certs be­cause of their test re­sults will re­ceive full re­funds.</p>
    <p>Con­cert­go­ers can be seated in groups of up to five, and in­ter­min­gling be­tween groups will not be al­lowed. Groups will be seated at least 1m apart. Sim­i­larly, sin­gle ticket hold­ers will be seated a safe dis­tance from other con­cert­go­ers.</p>
    <p>The au­di­ence can en­ter the venue only at des­ig­nated times, and must check in us­ing the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken. Dur­ing the show, they will be asked to re­main seated, un­less they need to visit the re­stroom, un­til the end of the per­for­mance. They will then be ush­ered out in groups.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors and ush­ers will be present to en­sure that safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures are ad­hered to be­fore, dur­ing and after the per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>The con­certs are put to­gether by con­cert or­gan­is­ers AEG Pre­sents and events agency Col­lec­tive Minds.</p>
    <p>Mr Zaran Vachha, co-founder of Col­lec­tive Minds, said the safe man­age­ment mea­sures are nec­es­sary to al­low the ail­ing lo­cal mu­sic in­dus­try to make a come­back.</p>
    <p>“The bru­tal im­pact of the pan­demic means we have had to work out a new way to sup­port Sin­ga­pore’s mu­sic in­dus­try and tal­ented mu­si­cians, whilst also en­sur­ing the ab­so­lute safety of mu­sic fans.”</p>
