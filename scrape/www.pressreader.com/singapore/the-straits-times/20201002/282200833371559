    <p>There have been sug­ges­tions by some to re­lax rules on mask wear­ing. It is wor­ry­ing that com­pla­cency is be­gin­ning to set in. The Covid-19 min­is­te­rial task force must con­tinue to re­mind all that the coro­n­avirus is very much alive and strong.</p>
    <p>Mask wear­ing when leav­ing your home (with the ex­cep­tion of when you are eat­ing or ex­er­cis­ing) must re­main the de­fault for many more months. It is very clear that mask wear­ing works to sig­nif­i­cantly bring down Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tor of the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion in the United States even went on record pub­licly to say that mask wear­ing is prob­a­bly even more ef­fec­tive than any vac­cine that may come next year to con­trol Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Mask wear­ing is a low hang­ing fruit that can be used by any­one now to con­trol Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Let’s con­tinue to wear our mask when we are out of our homes, ex­er­cise so­cial dis­tanc­ing and main­tain a high stan­dard of hy­giene.</p>
    <p>Let’s not let all our sac­ri­fices to gain some con­trol over the pan­demic over the past six months go to waste.</p>
