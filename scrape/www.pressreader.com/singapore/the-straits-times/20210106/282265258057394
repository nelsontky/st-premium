    <p>Ride-hail­ing firm Grab Hold­ings has been as­signed a B3 cor­po­rate family rat­ing (CFR) by rat­ings agency Moody’s, to re­flect the com­pany’s lead­ing po­si­tion in key re­gional mar­kets but also un­cer­tain­ties around its abil­ity to achieve sus­tained prof­its.</p>
    <p>In a re­search note on Mon­day, Moody’s said it does not ex­pect Grab’s earn­ings be­fore in­ter­est, taxes, de­pre­ci­a­tion, and amor­ti­sa­tion (Ebitda) to break even on a con­sol­i­dated ba­sis be­fore 2023, as growth plans for its fi­nan­cial ser­vices busi­ness will “tem­per over­all prof­itabil­ity” over the next two to three years.</p>
    <p>It said cash will be needed to ramp up new busi­nesses as well as po­ten­tial ac­qui­si­tions to grow this seg­ment, which of­fers cash­less pay­ment so­lu­tions, and prod­ucts and ser­vices such as in­sur­ance, lend­ing and wealth man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Grab, Moody’s noted, had about $3.2 billion of un­re­stricted cash and cash equiv­a­lents on its bal­ance sheet as at Sept 30 last year.</p>
    <p>Moody’s expects this will be suf­fi­cient to cover neg­a­tive op­er­at­ing cash flow, cap­i­tal spend­ing at its trans­port and food de­liv­ery busi­nesses and sched­uled debt ma­tu­ri­ties over at least the next two to three years.</p>
    <p>“The B3 CFR re­flects Grab’s lead­ing po­si­tion in key ride-hail­ing and food de­liv­ery mar­kets across South-east Asia, good long-term growth prospects, com­mit­ment to ex­er­cis­ing cost dis­ci­pline, as well as its sub­stan­tial cash hold­ings which should be suf­fi­cient to fund size­able op­er­at­ing losses and cash burn over at least the next two to three years,” said Moody’s an­a­lyst Stephanie Cheong.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the rat­ing re­flects un­cer­tain­ties around Grab’s abil­ity to achieve sus­tained prof­itabil­ity as low switch­ing costs for cus­tomers, driv­ers and mer­chants, as well as higher com­pet­i­tive in­ten­sity from ex­ist­ing and new play­ers could dis­rupt the com­pany’s path to prof­itabil­ity, Ms Cheong said.</p>
    <p>Grab faces strong com­pe­ti­tion from ri­val Go­jek in In­done­sia, the com­pany’s largest mar­ket based on gross rev­enue, and also from pure-play food de­liv­ery com­pa­nies such as De­liv­ery Hero (Food­panda), De­liv­eroo and Foody in South-east Asia’s frag­mented and com­pet­i­tive food de­liv­ery mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Moody’s said Grab’s rat­ing is also con­strained by in­vest­ment and ex­e­cu­tion risks as­so­ci­ated with the firm’s nascent dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The B3 CFR also con­sid­ers Grab’s “com­plex” cor­po­rate struc­ture and the redemption risk as­so­ci­ated with its con­vert­ible re­deemable pref­er­ence shares (CRPS), which can be put back to the com­pany af­ter June 2023.</p>
    <p>While Grab has ul­ti­mate con­trol of par­tially owned sub­sidiaries, its multi-ju­ris­dic­tional group struc­ture may in­hibit timely move­ment of cash among group en­ti­ties, said Moody’s. It expects Grab’s or­gan­i­sa­tional struc­ture to re­main com­plex as it ex­pands re­gion­ally.</p>
    <p>In terms of en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and gov­er­nance fac­tors, Moody’s con­sid­ered so­cial risks aris­ing from the so­ci­etal im­pact of its dis­rup­tive tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>It noted con­tro­ver­sies re­lated to push­back from tra­di­tional taxi com­pa­nies, worker strikes and per­sonal data breaches, and as a re­sult, in­creased reg­u­la­tory scru­tiny on the sec­tor – all of which could af­fect the firm’s rep­u­ta­tion and dis­rupt its busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Grab’s rat­ing could be down­graded if it has in­suf­fi­cient liq­uid­ity to fund its oper­a­tions and in­vest­ments over at least the next two to three years; its cash burn does not “mod­er­ate sig­nif­i­cantly as ex­pected” over the next 12-18 months; there is mean­ing­ful cash drain to fund new ven­tures, in­clud­ing its dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices busi­ness; in­creased com­pe­ti­tion or new reg­u­la­tory stan­dards weaken the com­pany’s mar­ket po­si­tion, cash flow or earn­ings rel­a­tive to Moody’s cur­rent ex­pec­ta­tions; or Grab is un­able to ex­tend the redemption date of its CRPS at least 12-18 months in ad­vance of June 2023.</p>
    <p>The agency also as­signed a B3 rat­ing to Grab and its sub­sidiary Grab</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy’s pro­posed se­nior se­cured term loan, where pro­ceeds from the loan will be used for gen­eral cor­po­rate pur­poses. The pro­posed loan will con­sti­tute the ma­jor­ity of Grab’s debt and is there­fore in line with the firm’s rat­ing.</p>
    <p>The out­look is sta­ble for now, which re­flects Moody’s ex­pec­ta­tion that Grab will main­tain a large cash buf­fer rel­a­tive to its op­er­at­ing cash needs over at least the next two to three years, and that cash burn will mod­er­ate sig­nif­i­cantly this year. The agency expects Grab to adopt a prudent fund­ing ap­proach to­wards ac­qui­si­tions or in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>“De­spite size­able losses his­tor­i­cally, Grab has demon­strated its abil­ity to gen­er­ate earn­ings in ride­hail­ing mar­kets where it has a lead­ing po­si­tion. It has also com­mit­ted to ex­er­cis­ing cost dis­ci­pline, which should sup­port prof­itabil­ity go­ing for­ward,” said the agency.</p>
    <p>While Grab has ul­ti­mate con­trol of par­tially owned sub­sidiaries, its multi-ju­ris­dic­tional group struc­ture may in­hibit timely move­ment of cash among group en­ti­ties, said Moody’s.</p>
