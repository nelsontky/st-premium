    <p>Rank-and-file work­ers in waste man­age­ment and re­cy­cling are one step closer to hav­ing bet­ter wages tied to a skills de­vel­op­ment lad­der, after the labour move­ment pro­posed set­ting up a tri­par­tite com­mit­tee to look into en­act­ing a pro­gres­sive wage model (PWM) for the sec­tor. Some 5,000 work­ers stand to ben­e­fit when the PWM is im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>Rank-and-file work­ers in waste man­age­ment and re­cy­cling are one step closer to hav­ing bet­ter wages tied to a skills de­vel­op­ment lad­der, after the labour move­ment pro­posed set­ting up a tri­par­tite com­mit­tee to look into im­ple­ment­ing a pro­gres­sive wage model for the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Zainal Sa­pari, dis­clos­ing the de­vel­op­ment yes­ter­day, said the pro­posal was sent to the Min­istry of Man­power on May 27, after get­ting buy-in from the Waste Man­age­ment and Re­cy­cling As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore, which rep­re­sents 166 com­pa­nies in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Some 5,000 rank-and-file work­ers from the sec­tor, such as garbage truck driv­ers and refuse sorters, stand to ben­e­fit when the pro­gres­sive wage model is im­ple­mented, said NTUC sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ng Chee Meng.</p>
    <p>The me­dian wage of such work­ers is around $2,000, said as­so­ci­a­tion chair­man Melissa Tan.</p>
    <p>She added that com­pa­nies in the waste man­age­ment sec­tor, which em­ploys some 16,000 work­ers, a size­able num­ber of whom are for­eign­ers, have found it an up­hill task to at­tract Sin­ga­pore­ans as the sec­tor suf­fers from a rep­u­ta­tion prob­lem.</p>
    <p>New pos­si­bil­i­ties could open up for work­ers if a pro­gres­sive wage model is in­tro­duced for the sec­tor, Mr Ng and Mr Zainal said dur­ing a visit to waste man­age­ment com­pany Wah & Hua in Kranji Cres­cent yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The tri­par­tite com­mit­tee, which will bring to­gether unions, em­ploy­ers and the Govern­ment, is set to be chaired by NTUC op­er­a­tions and mo­bil­i­sa­tion di­vi­sion sec­re­tar­iat di­rec­tor and Marine Pa­rade GRC MP Mohd Fahmi Ali­man, while dis­cus­sions are un­der way on pick­ing other rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
    <p>De­scribed as a min­i­mum wage tied to a skills lad­der, the pro­gres­sive wage model had its mer­its and draw­backs aired in Par­lia­ment last week.</p>
    <p>The Work­ers’ Party said the model has been im­ple­mented too slowly, and has pushed for a uni­ver­sal min­i­mum wage of $1,300 in­stead.</p>
    <p>Since it was first mooted in 2012, the pro­gres­sive wage model has been rolled out in the clean­ing, se­cu­rity and land­scap­ing sec­tors.</p>
    <p>But the Govern­ment cited fig­ures to show that the model has helped lift the wages of 80,000 clean­ers, se­cu­rity guards and land­scape work­ers by 30 per cent in re­cent years, and is also more sus­tain­able as it is im­ple­mented only with the sup­port of com­pa­nies in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, who is gen­eral man­ager at Wah & Hua, said the pro­gres­sive wage model will be a way to help boost the im­age of the in­dus­try by im­prov­ing the prospects of work­ers and also up­ping pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Her com­pany’s work­force is made up of 60 per cent Sin­ga­pore­ans and 40 per cent for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Asked about the re­cent de­bate on the pro­gres­sive wage model and min­i­mum wage, Mr Ng said that in the long run, NTUC hopes to raise the wages of work­ers in dif­fer­ent sec­tors not just through the pro­gres­sive wage model, but also by “look­ing at the to­tal pos­si­bil­i­ties for work­ers”.</p>
    <p>Elab­o­rat­ing, he said that the pro­gres­sive wage model, work­ing in con­cert with the Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment scheme, which tops up the wages of lower-wage work­ers, has helped to im­prove the lot of work­ers with­out em­ploy­ers hav­ing to solely bear the bur­den of rais­ing wages.</p>
    <p>With the Govern­ment step­ping in to top up wages first with the Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment, em­ploy­ers can im­prove pro­duc­tiv­ity so that the en­tire in­dus­try pro­gresses and work­ers can be paid more, he said.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Man­darin, he said push­ing for a higher wage with­out con­sid­er­ing the re­al­i­ties of the in­dus­try would be akin to pro­tect­ing the rice bowls of work­ers but break­ing the rice jars of em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>If the higher pay is not sus­tain­able, com­pa­nies would close down and work­ers would be left with­out a job, he added.</p>
    <p>The waste man­age­ment sec­tor was hit by a dou­ble whammy re­cently amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With most Sin­ga­pore­ans stay­ing home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, the amount of waste gen­er­ated went up by about 15 to 20 per cent on av­er­age. But many of the for­eign­ers work­ing in the sec­tor were con­fined to their dor­mi­to­ries be­cause of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>This chal­lenge trig­gered a con­sor­tium of waste man­age­ment com­pa­nies to come up with a road map for trans­form­ing their sec­tor by us­ing tech­nol­ogy and boost­ing the skills of work­ers, said Waste Man­age­ment and Re­cy­cling As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore chair­man Melissa Tan.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, whose Wah & Hua com­pany is among the 17 busi­nesses in the con­sor­tium, said a key is­sue faced by many in the sec­tor is attracting Sin­ga­porean work­ers.</p>
    <p>While in­dus­try fig­ures are not avail­able, her com­pany’s work­force is made up of 60 per cent Sin­ga­pore­ans and 40 per cent for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>She said the pan­demic has driven home the im­por­tance of re­ly­ing on Sin­ga­pore­ans who are “here to stay”.</p>
    <p>“For too long, the waste sec­tor has had an unglam­orous im­age which af­fected the re­cruit­ment of Sin­ga­pore­ans. The road map has thus come at an op­por­tune time when we are fac­ing a for­eign man­power crunch made worse by Covid-19,” she added.</p>
    <p>The road map the con­sor­tium is work­ing on with the Na­tional Trades Union Congress and the Build­ing Con­struc­tion And Tim­ber In­dus­tries Em­ploy­ees Union (Batu) will fo­cus on, among other things, rais­ing wages so as to at­tract and re­tain tal­ent, she said.</p>
    <p>The other two ar­eas of fo­cus are: pro­vide op­por­tu­ni­ties for work­ers to con­tin­u­ally up­grade them­selves and to adopt tech­nol­ogy to im­prove pro­duc­tiv­ity and safety.</p>
    <p>The gen­eral waste man­age­ment in­dus­try hires 16,000 work­ers, with about 12,000 from the gen­eral waste col­lec­tion and re­cy­cling sub­sec­tors ex­pected to ben­e­fit from the planned trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The 5,000 or so rank-and-file work­ers, such as garbage truck at­ten­dants, waste sorters and garbage truck driv­ers, earn a me­dian wage of about $2,000 a month, said Ms Tan.</p>
    <p>Over the years, com­pa­nies in the sec­tor have looked to tech­nol­ogy to im­prove work­ing con­di­tions. For in­stance, some garbage trucks are fit­ted with a de­vice that un­furls a net at the push of a but­ton to cover the top of the trucks so that trash does not fly out in tran­sit.</p>
    <p>In the past, such tasks were done by work­ers who had to climb up the trucks to cover it with a can­vas sheet. The 15-minute task now takes less than a minute.</p>
    <p>With work­ers mak­ing six to eight trips a day, this means up to two hours saved per worker.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim Li­juan, di­rec­tor of Boon Poh Refuse Dis­posal, said im­ple­ment­ing the pro­gres­sive wage model i n the sec­tor – an idea mooted by the labour move­ment – will help raise wages, and could at­tract more Sin­ga­pore­ans with its prom­ise of more struc­tured ca­reer progress.</p>
    <p>But if wages go up, con­sumers must also be pre­pared to shoul­der part of the higher costs, she said.</p>
    <p>“It can­not be a po­si­tion where the Govern­ment says we in­crease work­ers’ pay, but our con­tract sums do not in­crease and that means the higher wages im­pact our op­er­at­ing costs,” Ms Lim added.</p>
    <p>“We also need to change the mind­set of the end-user.”</p>
    <p>ATTRACTING SIN­GA­PORE WORK­ERS For too long, the waste sec­tor has had an unglam­orous im­age which af­fected the re­cruit­ment of Sin­ga­pore­ans. The road map has thus come at an op­por­tune time when we are fac­ing a for­eign man­power crunch made worse by Covid-19.
