    <p>BRUSSELS/BER­LIN • Fi­nan­cial lead­ers from the Group of 20 (G-20) ma­jor economies on Wed­nes­day un­der­scored the ur­gent need to bring the spread of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic un­der con­trol, and vowed to “do what­ever it takes” to sup­port the global econ­omy and fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>In a lengthy com­mu­nique, G-20 fi­nance min­is­ters and cen­tral bank gover­nors also agreed in prin­ci­ple for the first time on a “Com­mon Frame­work” to deal on a case-by­case ba­sis with the ris­ing num­ber of low-in­come coun­tries fac­ing debt dis­tress. That marks a sig­nif­i­cant step for­ward for China, which has be­come a ma­jor cred­i­tor to poor coun­tries in re­cent years, but had baulked at the prospect of writ­ing off any debts, ac­cord­ing to sources fa­mil­iar with the G-20 de­lib­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal draft of the com­mu­nique, viewed by Reuters on Wed­nes­day dur­ing the an­nual meet­ings of the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, said the of­fi­cials would fi­nalise the new frame­work at an ex­tra­or­di­nary meet­ing be­fore G-20 lead­ers meet next month.</p>
    <p>An ear­lier draft had the min­is­ters adopt­ing the frame­work, but of­fi­cials were un­able to reach agree­ment on that step this week.</p>
    <p>G-20 of­fi­cials also agreed to ex­tend a freeze in of­fi­cial bi­lat­eral debt pay­ments by six months, given con­tin­ued liq­uid­ity pres­sure on low-in­come coun­tries, and ex­pressed dis­ap­point­ment about the ab­sence of pri­vate-sec­tor cred­i­tors in the mora­to­rium.</p>
    <p>World Bank pres­i­dent David Mal­pass told G-20 of­fi­cials that it was crit­i­cal to look be­yond the G-20’s Debt Ser­vice Sus­pen­sion Ini­tia­tive, which only de­fers pay­ments but does not re­duce them.</p>
    <p>He said the ur­gency of the cri­sis – which threat­ens to leave 150 mil­lion more peo­ple in ex­treme poverty by next year – re­quires more force­ful and quicker ac­tion on debt re­duc­tion for the most in­debted of the world’s poor­est na­tions.</p>
    <p>“The re­ces­sion in ad­vanced economies is less se­vere than had been feared, but in most de­vel­op­ing economies, it has be­come a de­pres­sion, espe­cially for the poor­est,” he said. “It’s ur­gent to make rapid progress on a frame­work be­cause the risk of dis­or­derly de­faults is ris­ing.”</p>
    <p>G-20 lead­ers, recog­nis­ing the un­even and highly un­cer­tain out­look for the global econ­omy, also pledged to con­tinue to ad­dress the dis­pro­por­tion­ate im­pact that the cri­sis has had on women, young peo­ple and other vul­ner­a­ble seg­ments of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>IMF man­ag­ing direc­tor Kristalina Ge­orgieva told a news con­fer­ence that more in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion is needed to work on a vac­cine, and early progress could boost global in­come by US$9 tril­lion (S$12.2 tril­lion) by 2025.</p>
    <p>“Nine months into the pan­demic, we are still strug­gling with the dark­ness of a cri­sis that has taken more than a mil­lion lives and driven the econ­omy into re­verse, caus­ing sharply higher un­em­ploy­ment, ris­ing poverty, and the risk of ‘a lost gen­er­a­tion’ in low-in­come coun­tries,” she said.</p>
    <p>“A durable eco­nomic re­cov­ery is pos­si­ble only if we beat the pan­demic ev­ery­where,” she added.</p>
    <p>The IMF projects a par­tial and un­even re­cov­ery next year, with global growth ex­pected to reach 5.2 per cent, but has warned that sig­nif­i­cant risks re­main, in­clud­ing the resur­gence of the virus.</p>
