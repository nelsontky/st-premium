    <p>Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) fac­ulty and staff have ral­lied to­gether to do­nate more than $10 mil­lion worth of their un­used an­nual leave to sup­port the univer­sity’s stu­dents.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, some 20,145 days of leave were con­trib­uted by 1,821 NTU em­ploy­ees, the univer­sity said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Each em­ployee do­nated an av­er­age of 11 days of leave, with some con­tribut­ing as many as 15 days. Em­ploy­ees re­ceive be­tween 21 and 42 days of leave ev­ery year, de­pend­ing on their em­ploy­ment scheme and length of ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Se­nior vice-pres­i­dent of ad­min­is­tra­tion Tan Aik Na said: “Some of our stu­dents’ par­ents have lost their jobs or have had their in­come re­duced. So, it is dou­bly im­por­tant dur­ing the pan­demic for us... to help these stu­dents.”</p>
    <p>The do­na­tions were on a vol­un­tary ba­sis, with par­tic­i­pat­ing em­ploy­ees re­deem­ing their un­used leave for do­na­tion to a fund of their choice. They could do­nate to the univer­sity’s bur­saries, gen­eral en­dow­ment or ed­u­ca­tion and stu­dent life fund.</p>
    <p>They could also chip in to 18 other school or cen­tre ad­vance­ment funds that sup­port stu­dent projects and club ac­tiv­i­ties such as sem­i­nars and re­search ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ivy Kwan was one of the em­ploy­ees who do­nated 15 days of leave.</p>
    <p>She chose to sup­port her alma mater, Nanyang Busi­ness School (NBS), where she also serves as as­sis­tant dean for career ser­vices. “I teach at NBS, and this is my lit­tle way of in­vest­ing in the fu­ture of my stu­dents. I would def­i­nitely do it again in the fu­ture,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Suan Hai, a se­nior lab­o­ra­tory ex­ec­u­tive from the School of Com­puter Science and En­gi­neer­ing, also con­trib­uted 15 days of his per­sonal leave to his school’s ad­vance­ment fund.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ways be­lieved in the value of ed­u­ca­tion and the im­por­tance of stu­dents’ suc­cess. As I am un­able to go on va­ca­tion this year, I felt I could turn this into some­thing good,” said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>An­other round of the do­na­tion ex­er­cise will be held in Oc­to­ber next year.</p>
