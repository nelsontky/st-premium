    <p>Nearly 30 years after her train­ing stint in China, for­mer na­tional gym­nast Eileen Chai still re­mem­bers the fear of mak­ing a wrong move and be­ing pun­ished.</p>
    <p>The memories are so vivid that the 42-year-old broke down in tears while re­count­ing her ex­pe­ri­ence to The Sun­day Times re­cently.</p>
    <p>Chai, who was nine when she trained in China for three years from the late 1980s to 1991, felt her pun­ish­ments were “lighter” than those of her Chi­nese peers as she was a for­eigner.</p>
    <p>Though she was not beaten, she had wit­nessed young gym­nasts from the sec­ond team be­ing beaten by coaches, adding: “It was not easy be­ing the ob­server be­cause you can hear them crying and it was tough. There was a lot of scold­ing but there wasn’t much beat­ing, so we (her train­ing group) were lucky.”</p>
    <p>Her pun­ish­ments were con­di­tion­ing ex­er­cises such as do­ing hand­stand holds un­til the coach was sat­is­fied. “Some­times you have to hold the hand­stand against the wall for the en­tire ses­sion for about 21/</p>
    <p>2 hours, and they don’t care whether you cry or not. I still re­mem­ber the feel­ing from those days where I would get so scared I’d be pun­ished.”</p>
    <p>The is­sue of ath­lete abuse has re­cently been a much-dis­cussed topic in lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional sport­ing cir­cles, with for­mer na­tional fig­ure skater Yu Shu­ran on July 22 open­ing up about the phys­i­cal, men­tal and ver­bal abuse she al­legedly suf­fered while train­ing in China.</p>
    <p>While Chai, a 1991 SEA Games bronze medal­list, stressed that she did not con­sider her ex­pe­ri­ence to be abu­sive as the coaches had “no in­ten­tion to harm”, she added that the meth­ods were “not the right way”. The for­mer ath­lete, who quit com­pet­i­tive sports in 1995 ow­ing to mul­ti­ple emo­tional and phys­i­cal set­backs, had pre­vi­ously partly at­trib­uted her so­cial per­for­mance anx­i­ety, a men­tal dis­or­der, to her train­ing in China.</p>
    <p>“For me, I see it as them not be­ing aware that (such meth­ods) would cause men­tal scars in the fu­ture,” said Chai, who re­turned to China in 1993 and 1995 for shorter stints in ath­let­ics and div­ing after she stopped gym­nas­tics at age 13.</p>
    <p>“The im­por­tant thing is that ath­letes have to be kept safe... coaches need to know how their ac­tions can scar kids’ lives.”</p>
    <p>ABUSE CAN HAP­PEN ANY­WHERE</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing Yu’s ac­count of abuse last month, for­mer women’s artis­tic gym­nas­tics na­tional head coach Ger­rit Beltman in the same week ad­mit­ted to hav­ing pre­vi­ously “mis­treated and hu­mil­i­ated young gym­nasts to win medals” before join­ing Sin­ga­pore Gym­nas­tics last Au­gust. He re­signed on July 17 to be with his fam­ily in the Nether­lands.</p>
    <p>These rev­e­la­tions come on the back of gym­nasts from Aus­tralia, Britain and the Nether­lands going pub­lic with ac­counts of mis­treat­ment suf­fered at the hands of their coaches. Ath­letes have also been shar­ing their sto­ries on so­cial me­dia un­der the hash­tag #Gym­nastAl­liance, with many de­cid­ing to do so after watch­ing the Net­flix doc­u­men­tary Ath­lete A. It de­tails for­mer USA Gym­nas­tics doc­tor Larry Nas­sar’s abuse of the girls and young women un­der his care and how the as­so­ci­a­tion cov­ered up his deeds.</p>
    <p>1991 SEA Games</p>
    <p>Beltman told The Sun­day Times his meth­ods en­tailed “putting pres­sure, be­lit­tling, in­creas­ing voice vol­ume, ig­nor­ing and iso­lat­ing”, adding that these had seemed to be “the path that would lead to re­sults”.</p>
    <p>The 64-year-old noted that this phe­nom­e­non can “arise any­where” mainly be­cause of the age gap be­tween very young ath­letes and their much older coaches. There is also some re­luc­tance from par­ents to ap­proach the coach in such cases. “For a rea­son that is in­ex­pli­ca­ble to me, many par­ents feel that in­ter­fer­ence with the coach­ing process is at the ex­pense of the chances of suc­cess,” said Beltman, adding that this was the “same ba­sic at­ti­tude” across many cul­tures.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he feels that Sin­ga­pore is a “long way ahead of many coun­tries”, point­ing to “a re­ally strong de­sire to cre­ate a safe and pos­i­tive en­vi­ron­ment for the gym­nasts”.</p>
    <p>2017 SEA Games KEEP­ING ATH­LETES SAFE</p>
    <p>The Safe Sport Com­mis­sion was launched last year to look into pre­ven­tive mea­sures to safe­guard ath­letes, coaches and other sports par­tic­i­pants. It was set up by na­tional sports body Sport Sin­ga­pore (SportSG) in part­ner­ship with the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion and the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force. The first Safe Sport fo­rum took place here in 2018, dur­ing which na­tional sports as­so­ci­a­tions (NSAs) pledged to have a safe sport pol­icy and a safe­guard­ing of­fi­cer by 2019.</p>
    <p>Nearly 100 safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers have been trained and of the 64 NSAs, fewer than 10 have yet to ap­point a safe­guard­ing of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>Over the last five years, SportSG has re­ceived 16 re­ported cases of abuse, four of which were re­ported through the dif­fer­ent chan­nels after the launch of the com­mis­sion. “All re­ported cases were thor­oughly i nves­ti­gated or are cur­rently un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion. To date, five cases have re­sulted in sanc­tion­ing,” a SportSG spokesman told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>It also “proac­tively en­sures that all NSAs adopt the nec­es­sary safe­guard­ing poli­cies and pro­ce­dures in their daily op­er­a­tions”. This in­cludes hav­ing a strin­gent hir­ing process for its na­tional coaches, which in­volves back­ground and po­lice checks, as well as tes­ti­mo­ni­als from their pre­vi­ous em­ploy­ers to vouch for their char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>“While NSAs are ul­ti­mately re­spon­si­ble for their hir­ing process, SportSG will also join its re­cruit­ment panel when pub­lic funds are in­volved or when our as­sis­tance is sought. This al­lows SportSG to pro­vide ad­di­tional scru­tiny to the hir­ing process,” added the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Yu, the 2017 SEA Games cham­pion who was born and raised in Bei­jing by her Sin­ga­porean fa­ther and</p>
    <p>Chi­nese mother, had ear­lier urged na­tional gov­ern­ing bod­ies around the world to re-eval­u­ate their poli­cies and ques­tion if they are do­ing enough to pre­vent and treat abuse cases. The 19-year-old also em­pha­sised the need for coaches to be ed­u­cated “about how abuse just isn’t a valid method”.</p>
    <p>SportSG said in the light of Yu’s al­le­ga­tions that ef­forts are taken to en­sure those in the sports fra­ter­nity “un­der­stand how cru­cial safe sport is and are aware of the due re­port­ing process for ath­letes to ei­ther a safe­guard­ing of­fi­cer or di­rectly to the Safe Sport Task­force”.</p>
    <p>COM­MU­NI­CA­TION AND ED­U­CA­TION ARE KEY</p>
    <p>Some na­tional ath­letes said they did not know who the safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers of their re­spec­tive NSAs were, when asked by The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>While hur­dler Ker­stin Ong is not one of them, the 23-year-old called for more ef­forts to ed­u­cate ath­letes on the re­sources avail­able.</p>
    <p>She had con­tacted the Safe Sport Com­mis­sion in June re­gard­ing her com­plaint against her for­mer coach, as the com­mis­sion had not been formed when she lodged a po­lice re­port and filed a com­plaint to SportSG in Jan­uary 2018.</p>
    <p>Ong had ac­cused the man of mis­con­duct in 2016 and he was in 2018 sus­pended from the Na­tional Reg­istry of Coaches for two years after an in­ves­ti­ga­tion by a dis­ci­plinary panel con­vened by SportSG. He made an appeal and his sus­pen­sion was re­duced to 18 months. Ong con­tacted the com­mis­sion as she felt her case was “poorly han­dled”.</p>
    <p>While she said the com­mis­sion has been help­ful as it of­fered support through coun­selling, she felt that more in­for­ma­tion was needed so vic­tims know how to seek help.</p>
    <p>She also urged more trans­parency in man­ag­ing cases, sug­gest­ing that the au­thor­i­ties could con­sider pub­lish­ing the grounds of de­ci­sion. “I re­ally hope for lo­cal sport au­thor­i­ties to re­flect on their short­com­ings so that the process is more help­ful to ath­letes who may want to re­port cases in the fu­ture,” she added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) has two safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers and its ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ma­lik Alju­nied said it is in the process of “draft­ing a set of com­pre­hen­sive Safe Sport guide­lines which will be com­mu­ni­cated to all our stake­hold­ers”. He also noted SA’s rig­or­ous screen­ing process in hir­ing staff, which en­tails strin­gent back­ground checks with past em­ploy­ees and peers, and cross-ref­er­enc­ing with var­i­ous agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­poreSail­ing also has two safe­guard­ing of­fi­cers, one of whom is gen­eral man­ager Chung Pei Ming. This role in­cludes coach ed­u­ca­tion, at­tend­ing work­shops on safe sport and learn­ing about best prac­tices from other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“Back then there was no safe sport com­mit­ment state­ment but to us, it was al­ready something we had to do. We de­scribed the forms of abuse – phys­i­cal, emo­tional, sex­ual – and how to look out for signs in a child who is po­ten­tially be­ing abused,” said Chung, adding that coaches are briefed at least once a year on these guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Sailors in the na­tional train­ing squads are also re­minded of the avail­able plat­forms to seek help.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist Carol Balhetchet said that in sports where coaches are of­ten in close and con­stant in­ter­ac­tions with very young ath­letes, par­ents should not only teach their chil­dren how to iden­tify good and bad touch, but also how to get in touch with their emo­tions.</p>
    <p>“Teach them what be­ing un­com­fort­able feels like or re­hearse with them, teach them what’s awk­ward,” said Dr Balhetchet, stress­ing that a par­ent should be a trusted adult that a child can turn to.</p>
    <p>“Talk about it when your child comes back about train­ing – don’t just ask whether they won or lost, but whether they en­joyed them­selves and whether there were good or bad ex­pe­ri­ences.”</p>
    <p>Chai’s mother had fre­quently re­minded her daugh­ter that she could come home any time, but the lat­ter in­sisted on re­main­ing in China as she wanted to be­come a bet­ter gym­nast.</p>
    <p>Now a vi­o­lin teacher, Chai some­times can­not bring her­self to fin­ish read­ing ar­ti­cles on ath­letes’ abuse. “I’d read the first para­graph and I wouldn’t read on be­cause I didn’t want to re­mem­ber the bad mo­ments, so I wouldn’t feel that fear com­ing back to me,” she said, re­call­ing that she teared while read­ing about Yu’s or­deal.</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry for what Shu­ran went through, but good for her for speak­ing up so that we can have con­ver­sa­tions about this.”</p>
    <p>Then na­tional gym­nast Eileen Chai per­form­ing at the 1991 SEA Games, where she won a bronze medal. She trained in China for three years from the late 1980s to 1991.</p>
    <p>’LIGHTER’ PUN­ISH­MENTS</p>
    <p>It was not easy be­ing the ob­server be­cause you can hear them crying and it was tough. There was a lot of scold­ing but there wasn’t much beat­ing, so we (her train­ing group) were lucky. ’’</p>
