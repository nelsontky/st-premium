    <p>We thank the writers for their letters (Pass law and make it clear by Mr Ong Hock Cheng; Use per­sua­sion to bring about be­havioural change by Dr Yik Keng Yeong; Change be­hav­iour through penalties and at­ti­tude will fol­low suit by Mr Seng Joo How, all on</p>
    <p>Sept 25; and Mess left be­hind by din­ers is a health haz­ard by Mr Ang Tun Loon, Sept 29).</p>
    <p>Most of the writers feel that it is time to take firmer ac­tion on tray re­turn or even make it manda­tory by in­vok­ing the law, al­though there is also a view that gen­tler per­sua­sion to re­turn trays will ef­fect a pos­i­tive change in be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) agrees that more can be done to im­prove tray re­turn rates at our hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, the NEA launched the SG Clean cam­paign to gal­vanise col­lec­tive ac­tion to keep our premises clean. This in­cluded en­cour­ag­ing tray re­turn as one of the seven habits of good pub­lic hy­giene. Such habits should be sus­tained as a way of life be­yond the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>In July, the NEA launched a tray re­turn pro­gramme to re­mind pa­trons to re­turn all used crock­ery and trays to keep the ta­ble clean for the next pa­tron.</p>
    <p>We also ramped up our mes­sag­ing to cor­rect mis­con­cep­tions about tray re­turn at our hawker cen­tres.</p>
    <p>We high­lighted that it will not cause clean­ers to lose their jobs, but makes the jobs of clean­ers eas­ier and safer in­stead, as it min­imises their ex­po­sure to soiled tis­sues and wipes, which, if con­tam­i­nated, could pose a hy­giene risk.</p>
    <p>Since June 19, the NEA has also been de­ploy­ing SG Clean am­bas­sadors to ad­vise pa­trons to re­turn their used crock­ery and trays.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, about a third or more of pa­trons, when ap­proached by our am­bas­sadors, still refuse to heed their ad­vice.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess of the tray re­turn ini­tia­tive re­lies heav­ily on the com­mu­nity’s gra­cious­ness and co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>We ap­pre­ci­ate the pub­lic dis­course on this is­sue and con­tinue to look for more ef­fec­tive mea­sures, in­clud­ing tak­ing stronger ac­tions, to get pa­trons to re­turn their used crock­ery and trays.</p>
    <p>This will not only help safe­guard pub­lic health but also en­sure that our com­mu­nity din­ing rooms re­main clean and hy­gienic places for all to en­joy.</p>
