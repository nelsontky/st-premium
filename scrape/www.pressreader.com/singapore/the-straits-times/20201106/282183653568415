    <p>To en­sure eco­nomic growth and fight cli­mate change at the same time, Sin­ga­pore needs to lever­age green fi­nance and mo­bilise cap­i­tal for low-car­bon in­vest­ments, said Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Des­mond Tan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>And to suc­ceed in its ef­forts, the coun­try also needs to plan ahead for a smooth tran­si­tion to low emis­sions and build re­silience against en­vi­ron­men­tal shocks, he added.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated pre-ex­ist­ing trends, in­clud­ing ris­ing pro­tec­tion­ism, ris­ing in­equal­i­ties and global warm­ing,” Mr Tan, who is also Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs, noted in his speech at the European Union-Sin­ga­pore Di­a­logue on cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>But it has also slowed ac­tiv­i­ties. “Com­pa­nies should use this pe­riod to con­sider im­ple­ment­ing en­ergy ef­fi­ciency im­prove­ment projects so that they can be more cost-com­pet­i­tive and emerge stronger from this cri­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>To im­ple­ment these, they can tap the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board’s Re­source Ef­fi­ciency Grant for En­ergy as well as the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency’s En­ergy Ef­fi­ciency Fund, Mr Tan added.</p>
    <p>Point­ing to green fi­nance, he said it is a “crit­i­cal en­abler of green growth” that al­lows com­pa­nies to sup­port sus­tain­able ini­tia­tives while en­sur­ing good re­turns.</p>
    <p>Green fi­nance refers to an area of bank­ing and in­vest­ment-sup­port­ing projects that con­sider a range of en­vi­ron­men­tal con­cerns.</p>
    <p>In June, Sin­ga­pore joined the EUini­ti­ated In­ter­na­tional Plat­form on Sus­tain­able Fi­nance to help pro­mote the in­te­gra­tion of markets for green fi­nance prod­ucts in­ter­na­tion­ally.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic is also Asean’s largest green fi­nance mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s vir­tual di­a­logue al­lowed pol­i­cy­mak­ers, pri­vate sec­tor rep­re­sen­ta­tives and ex­perts from the EU and Sin­ga­pore to share in­sights on cli­mate ac­tion.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Si­mon Tay, chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs, which or­gan­ised the di­a­logue, noted that de­spite the mas­sive global lock­downs this year, to­tal emis­sions for the year will shrink by only about 7 per cent com­pared with last year.</p>
    <p>“This barely meets the an­nual re­duc­tion (of 7.6 per cent) the United Na­tions En­vi­ron­ment Pro­gramme says the world needs to achieve con­sis­tently if we are to keep global warm­ing be­low 2 deg C or lower,” he added.</p>
    <p>The di­a­logue also ex­plored ways in which Sin­ga­pore and the EU can col­lab­o­rate on cli­mate-re­lated projects.</p>
    <p>The European Com­mis­sion’s Direc­torate-Gen­eral for Cli­mate Ac­tion Mauro Pet­ric­cione said both sides can work on cre­at­ing an in­ter­na­tional level play­ing field around new sus­tain­able tech­nolo­gies such as re­new­able hy­dro­gen, so­lar en­ergy, and car­bon cap­ture and stor­age. Both the EU and Sin­ga­pore ac­count for less than 10 per cent of global emis­sions, he noted.</p>
    <p>“Nei­ther of us can stop global cli­mate change alone. But there are many things that we can do to­gether to fa­cil­i­tate the rapid tran­si­tion to a pros­per­ous net-zero so­ci­ety around the world.”</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic has set aside $49 mil­lion to fund low-car­bon en­ergy re­search and test-bed­ding ef­forts in hy­dro­gen- and car­bon-cap­ture util­i­sa­tion and stor­age.</p>
    <p>The EU, mean­while, un­veiled a hy­dro­gen strat­egy in July.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s chief ne­go­tia­tor for cli­mate change Joseph Teo said the na­tion hopes “to tap EU’s ex­per­tise in this area (of hy­dro­gen) and col­lab­o­rate to launch pi­lots and demon­stra­tion projects”.</p>
    <p>Look­ing to next Novem­ber’s UN Cli­mate Change Con­fer­ence in Glas­gow, Mr Teo, who is from the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, said much work needs to be done to fi­nalise out­stand­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions on the Paris Agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The ar­eas pend­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions are Ar­ti­cle 6 on the pact’s car­bon mar­ket rules, the en­hanced trans­parency frame­work and the new col­lec­tive goal on cli­mate fi­nance.</p>
    <p>CON­SIDER NEW PROJECTS Com­pa­nies should use this pe­riod to con­sider im­ple­ment­ing en­ergy ef­fi­ciency im­prove­ment projects so that they can be more cost-com­pet­i­tive and emerge stronger from this cri­sis. MR DES­MOND TAN, Min­is­ter of State for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, re­fer­ring to the im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
