    <p>HONG KONG • A Hong Kong man who re­cov­ered from Covid-19 was in­fected again 41/ months later in</p>
    <p>2 the first doc­u­mented in­stance of hu­man re-in­fec­tion, re­searchers at the Univer­sity of Hong Kong have said.</p>
    <p>The find­ings in­di­cate that the dis­ease, which has killed more than 800,000 peo­ple world­wide, may con­tinue to spread among the global pop­u­la­tion de­spite herd im­mu­nity, they said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old male was cleared of Covid-19 and dis­charged from a hospi­tal in April, but tested pos­i­tive again af­ter re­turn­ing from Spain via Bri­tain on Aug 15.</p>
    <p>The pa­tient had ap­peared to be pre­vi­ously healthy, re­searchers said in the paper, which was ac­cepted by the in­ter­na­tional med­i­cal jour­nal Clin­i­cal In­fec­tious Dis­eases.</p>
    <p>He was found to have con­tracted a dif­fer­ent coro­n­avirus strain from the one he had pre­vi­ously con­tracted, and re­mained asymp­to­matic for the sec­ond in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“The find­ing does not mean tak­ing vac­cines will be use­less,” Dr Kai-Wang To, one of the lead­ing au­thors of the paper, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“Im­mu­nity in­duced by vac­ci­na­tion can be dif­fer­ent from those in­duced by nat­u­ral in­fec­tion,” Dr To said, adding that the ef­fec­tive­ness of vac­cines will be known only af­ter re­sults of vac­cine tri­als are out.</p>
    <p>World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion epi­demi­ol­o­gist Maria Van Kerkhove said yes­ter­day there was no need to jump to any con­clu­sions in re­sponse to the Hong Kong case.</p>
    <p>In­stances of peo­ple dis­charged from hos­pi­tals and test­ing pos­i­tive again for Covid-19 in­fec­tion have been re­ported in main­land China.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in those cases, it was not clear whether they had con­tracted the virus again af­ter full re­cov­ery – as hap­pened to the Hong Kong pa­tient – or still had the virus in their body from the ini­tial in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The pre­lim­i­nary num­ber of pa­tients in China who tested pos­i­tive again once be­ing dis­charged from hospi­tal was be­tween 5 per cent and 15 per cent, Dr Wang Guiqiang, an in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ist in China’s ex­pert group for Covid-19 treat­ment, said dur­ing a press brief­ing in May.</p>
    <p>One ex­pla­na­tion was that the virus still ex­isted in the lungs of pa­tients but was not de­tected in sam­ples taken from up­per parts of the res­pi­ra­tory tract, he said.</p>
    <p>Other pos­si­ble causes were low sen­si­tiv­ity of tests and weak im­mu­nity that could lead to per­sis­tent pos­i­tive re­sults, he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Jef­frey Bar­rett, an ex­pert and con­sul­tant with the Covid-19 Genome Project at Bri­tain’s Well­come Sanger In­sti­tute, told Reuters that it was very hard to make any strong in­fer­ence from a sin­gle ob­ser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>“Given the num­ber of global in­fec­tions to date, see­ing one case of re-in­fec­tion is not that sur­pris­ing even if it is a very rare oc­cur­rence,” he said.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong yes­ter­day re­ported seven lo­cal cases, of which four are of un­known ori­gin. It was the first time the city re­ported sin­gle-digit daily cases since the lat­est wave be­gan early last month. The city also found two im­ported cases, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of cases to 4,691.</p>
