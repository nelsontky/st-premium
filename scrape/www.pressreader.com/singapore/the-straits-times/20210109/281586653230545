    </section>

    <p>A Korean na­tional, 24, is the first em­ployee who tested pos­i­tive. The work per­mit holder has also pre­lim­i­nar­ily tested pos­i­tive for the more in­fec­tious UK B117 strain, and is pend­ing fur­ther con­fir­ma­tory tests.</p>
    <p>The man, who de­liv­ers prepacked meals to air crew and ho­tel guests, works at Azur restau­rant. He does not in­ter­act with din­ers.</p>
    <p>He tested pos­i­tive for a pooled swab dur­ing rostered rou­tine test­ing last Satur­day, and was tested again on Mon­day. That same day, he started to de­velop acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion symp­toms.</p>
    <p>His re­sult came back pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on Tues­day, and he was taken to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID).</p>
    <p>His sero­log­i­cal test re­sult was neg­a­tive, mean­ing it was likely a cur­rent in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>CASE 59059</p>
    <p>The sec­ond Covid-19 in­fected em­ployee, who also works at the Azur restau­rant at the Crowne Plaza Changi Air­port, is a 43-year-old Malaysian with the same job scope as the first worker.</p>
    <p>She de­vel­oped symp­toms at work on Sun­day, and went to a GP on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>She tested pos­i­tive, and was taken to the NCID. Her sero­log­i­cal test came back neg­a­tive, and pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions showed that she was prob­a­bly not in­fected with the B117 strain.</p>
    <p>Her ear­lier rostered rou­tine test was neg­a­tive.</p>
    <p>CASE 59084</p>
    <p>The third case is a 20-year-old Sin­ga­porean who has the same job scope at Azur as the pre­vi­ous two cases. He was iden­ti­fied as a close con­tact of the first case and was quar­an­tined. He de­vel­oped symp­toms on Thurs­day, and has also pre­lim­i­nar­ily tested pos­i­tive for the B117 strain, pend­ing con­fir­ma­tory tests. His sero­log­i­cal test was neg­a­tive. His ear­lier rostered rou­tine tests were also neg­a­tive.</p>
