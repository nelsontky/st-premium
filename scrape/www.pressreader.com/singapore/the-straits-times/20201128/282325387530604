    <p>Preven­tion of di­a­betes should start from a young age – per­haps even be­fore birth, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Health’s (MOH) chief sci­en­tist Tan Chorh Chuan.</p>
    <p>He noted that one in five moth­ers in Sin­ga­pore gets di­a­betes dur­ing preg­nancy, a con­di­tion known as ges­ta­tional di­a­betes. With­out interventi­on, this sig­nif­i­cantly raises the risk of both mother and child get­ting di­a­betes later in life.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Tan said screen­ing for ges­ta­tional di­a­betes and pre­vent­ing or help­ing to man­age it can mit­i­gate this risk and also makes the preg­nancy safer for the mother.</p>
    <p>“If we wanted to do health pro­mo­tion right at the start, then that’s a good place to start – in preg­nancy,” said Prof Tan, who is also ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the MOH Of­fice of Health­care Trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing on Wed­nes­day at The Straits Times’ we­bi­nar, Keep­ing Sin­ga­pore Healthy. The we­bi­nar was spon­sored by in­sur­ance provider Pru­den­tial and hosted by ST’s se­nior health cor­re­spon­dent Salma Kha­lik.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan said re­search is un­der way in Sin­ga­pore to ex­am­ine the ef­fects of eat­ing habits in early child­hood. While the data has yet to be pub­lished, he said it sug­gests chil­dren’s eat­ing habits af­fect their propen­sity for obe­sity later on.</p>
    <p>But even though it is best to start young when it comes to pre­vent­ing chronic dis­eases like di­a­betes,</p>
    <p>Prof Tan also said it is never too late to start tak­ing ac­tion to pre­vent or man­age such dis­eases.</p>
    <p>He said even those who al­ready have di­a­betes, high blood pres­sure or high blood choles­terol can get these un­der con­trol and pre­vent fur­ther com­pli­ca­tions if they eat healthily, ex­er­cise and avoid smok­ing. In fact, over a third of the dis­ease bur­den fac­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans – a mea­sure of the num­ber of years of healthy life lost to dis­ease, dis­abil­ity or early death – can be pre­vented through these three ac­tions, added Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>He said diet, ex­er­cise and smok­ing are just three be­havioural risk fac­tors that ac­counted for more than 40 per cent of deaths, cit­ing a study by the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment agency Pub­lic Health Eng­land.</p>
    <p>“I think the main mes­sage, which is im­por­tant to re­mem­ber, is that preven­tion should be started as early as pos­si­ble, but at the same time, it’s never too late to start preven­tion,” said Prof Tan.</p>
    <p>He noted that preven­tion works on mul­ti­ple lev­els and does not ap­ply to only those who are cur­rently healthy. “Even if you’re un­lucky enough to have, say, a stroke... if you con­trol your blood pres­sure well, you can re­duce the risk of a sec­ond stroke by 20 per cent to 30 per cent. So preven­tion can work at many lev­els and still be ef­fec­tive.”</p>
    <p>Giv­ing an­other ex­am­ple, Prof Tan – a re­nal physi­cian by train­ing – said the most com­mon cause of kid­ney fail­ure re­quir­ing dial­y­sis in Sin­ga­pore is di­a­betes, and it is pre­ventable even if one has early di­a­betic kid­ney dis­ease.</p>
    <p>“If you man­age that well – your blood sugar, your blood pres­sure – (with) reg­u­lar med­i­cal care, you can ac­tu­ally slow down the pro­gres­sion of kid­ney fail­ure and markedly re­duce your risk of re­quir­ing dial­y­sis.”</p>
    <p>Prof Tan noted that there is cur­rently no such thing as a vac­cine for di­a­betes, so one way to mit­i­gate the com­pli­ca­tions aris­ing from di­a­betes is through bet­ter pre­dic­tion of the dis­ease ear­lier in life.</p>
    <p>This can be done through genome se­quenc­ing, which can de­ter­mine one’s ge­netic risk pro­file and iden­tify those with a higher like­li­hood of de­vel­op­ing cer­tain dis­eases, Prof Tan said.</p>
