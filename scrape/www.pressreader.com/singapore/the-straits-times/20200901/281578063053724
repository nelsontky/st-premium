    <p>Lady Gaga (be­low) and Korean boy band BTS were the ma­jor win­ners at MTV’s Video Mu­sic Awards, which paid so­cially dis­tanced homage to New York City, as themes of vot­ing and ra­cial jus­tice punc­tu­ated the night. Some at­ten­dees also paid trib­ute to ac­tor Chad­wick Bose­man, who died of cancer last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • MTV’s Video Mu­sic Awards (VMA) on Sun­day was an un­ortho­dox show that paid so­cially dis­tanced homage to New York City, as themes of vot­ing and ra­cial jus­tice punc­tu­ated the night.</p>
    <p>The 2020 VMA – a show known more for os­ten­ta­tious per­for­mances, made-for-Twit­ter mo­ments and wild cos­tumes than the ac­tual awards – was scaled back due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, with per­for­mances held at out­door spa­ces and many celebri­ties ac­cept­ing prizes via video.</p>
    <p>Host Keke Palmer, known for her role in last year’s film Hustlers, opened the show with an emo­tional cold-open pay­ing trib­ute to ac­tor Chad­wick Bose­man, who died of cancer last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian R&B singer The Weeknd then launched into a per­for­mance of the hit Blind­ing Lights atop a view­ing deck pro­trud­ing from a Man­hat­tan sky­scraper.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally hard for me to cel­e­brate right now,” he said in ac­cept­ing his moon man tro­phy for Best R&B. “I’m just go­ing to say jus­tice for Ja­cob Blake and jus­tice for Bre­onna Tay­lor,” he con­tin­ued, re­fer­ring to the re­cent black vic­tims of po­lice vi­o­lence. It was one of many nods to the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment, ac­knowl­edg­ing a year that has seen months of anti-racism protests.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral stars en­cour­aged vot­ing dur­ing the show where the Joe Bi­den cam­paign bought a num­ber of ad­ver­tise­ments in a bid to reach youth in his cam­paign against United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump. Lady Gaga took home tro­phies in­clud­ing Artist Of The Year and Song Of The Year for Rain On Me, her col­lab­o­ra­tion with Ari­ana Grande.</p>
    <p>The pair staged a fu­tur­is­tic per­for­mance atop the Em­pire State Build­ing, both masked, with Gaga in a corseted get-up, one of her many ec­cen­tric cos­tumes of the night.</p>
    <p>“This has not been an easy year for a lot of peo­ple, but what I see in the world is a mas­sive tri­umph of courage,” she said. “Stay safe. Speak your mind and, I might sound like a bro­ken record, but wear a mask. It’s a sign of re­spect.”</p>
    <p>This year’s edi­tion in­cluded new awards recog­nis­ing the tu­mul­tuous year in mu­sic, with the pan­demic halt­ing tours and fes­ti­vals world­wide in a dev­as­tat­ing blow to the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Grande and fel­low pop star Justin Bieber won Best Mu­sic Video From Home for Stuck With You, while Latin boy band CNCO won Best Quar­an­tine Per­for­mance for Un­plugged At Home.</p>
    <p>And while Amer­i­can pop reg­u­lars in­clud­ing Gaga, Grande and Tay­lor Swift all took home tro­phies, they were up­set in their genre’s pri­mary cat­e­gory by Korean megas­tars BTS, which won for Best Pop for On.</p>
    <p>The boy band, who also won Best K-Pop, Best Group and Best Chore­og­ra­phy, held a green-screen per­for­mance that placed them in front of the Brook­lyn Bridge in a shot re­call­ing the clas­sic film Once Upon A Time In Amer­ica (1984) that starred Robert DeNiro.</p>
