    <p>• New York Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo on Thurs­day dis­missed as “ir­rel­e­vant” a US Supreme Court de­ci­sion block­ing coro­n­avirus re­stric­tions im­posed on re­li­gious gath­er­ings, say­ing it re­lated to spe­cific ar­eas that were no longer con­sid­ered at high risk.</p>
    <p>The court, which has a 6-3 con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity, voted 5-4 late on Wed­nes­day in favour of re­quests by the Ro­man Catholic Dio­cese of Brook­lyn and two Ortho­dox Jewish con­gre­ga­tions for an in­junc­tion to block the re­stric­tions from be­ing en­forced.</p>
    <p>The or­der marked one of the first con­se­quen­tial ac­tions on the court of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s new ap­pointee, con­ser­va­tive Jus­tice Amy Coney Barrett, who cast a de­cid­ing vote i n favour of the re­li­gious groups.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tive Chief Jus­tice John Roberts dis­sented along with the court’s three lib­er­als.</p>
    <p>“Happy Thanks­giv­ing!” Mr Trump tweeted on Thurs­day in re­sponse to the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>The case stemmed from an Oct 6 de­ci­sion by Mr Cuomo, a Demo­crat, to shut down non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses i n tar­geted ar­eas where in­fec­tions have spiked, in­clud­ing some neigh­bour­hoods in Brook­lyn.</p>
    <p>New York has cat­e­gorised ar­eas where coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions are in­creas­ing in sever­ity as yel­low, orange or red.</p>
    <p>Un­der Mr Cuomo’s re­stric­tions, houses of wor­ship in red zones could re­main open at 25 per cent ca­pac­ity up to a max­i­mum of 10 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, Mr Cuomo said the high court’s rul­ing would have no im­pact on the state’s virus con­trol ef­forts be­cause the red zone sta­tus for the area in ques­tion had ex­pired last week.</p>
    <p>“It’s ir­rel­e­vant from any prac­ti­cal im­pact be­cause the zone that they were talk­ing about has al­ready been moot,” the gov­er­nor said.</p>
    <p>“I think this was re­ally just an op­por­tu­nity for the court to ex­press its phi­los­o­phy and pol­i­tics,” he added.</p>
    <p>He also said the de­ci­sion, which now goes to the 2nd US Cir­cuit Court of Ap­peals, is not fi­nal and did not ap­pear to af­fect New York state’s rules for mass gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>The houses of wor­ship ar­gued the lim­its im­posed by the state vi­o­lated re­li­gious free­doms pro­tected by the US Con­sti­tu­tion’s First Amend­ment, and that their fa­cil­i­ties were sin­gled out for more strin­gent re­stric­tions than es­sen­tial busi­nesses, such as food stores.</p>
    <p>The Ortho­dox con­gre­ga­tions Agu­dath Is­rael of Kew Gar­den Hills and Agu­dath Is­rael of Madi­son, as well as na­tion­wide Ortho­dox Jewish group Agu­dath Is­rael of Amer­ica, re­quested the in­junc­tion.</p>
    <p>A fed­eral judge in Brook­lyn re­jected sep­a­rate re­quests made by the re­li­gious groups on Oct 9. The New York City-based 2nd Cir­cuit de­clined emer­gency re­quests filed by both chal­lengers on Nov 9.</p>
    <p>In two pre­vi­ous cases this year, the court, in 5-4 votes, turned away s i mi l a r re­quests by churches in Ne­vada and Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Those votes occurred be­fore the death of Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg, and saw her and the other three lib­eral mem­bers of the court joined by Mr Roberts in the ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Cuomo urged New York­ers to “mask up” in a tweet on Thurs­day, adding that nearly 7,000 peo­ple in the state had tested pos­i­tive the day be­fore while 67 died as a re­sult of the virus.</p>
