    <p>Sin­ga­pore is the 14th most ex­pen­sive city in the world for ex­pa­tri­ates, mov­ing down two spots from last year’s rank­ing be­cause of the weak­en­ing Sin­ga­pore dol­lar.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic has been over­taken by Copen­hagen in Den­mark and Bern in Switzer­land, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey re­leased by hu­man re­source con­sul­tancy ECA In­ter­na­tional yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong re­mains the most ex­pen­sive lo­ca­tion for ex­pa­tri­ates to live in de­spite fall­ing rental due to the on­go­ing po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty, fol­lowed by Tokyo and New York.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Quane, ECA In­ter­na­tional’s di­rec­tor for Asia, said the Covid-19 pan­demic has re­sulted in a global re­ces­sion, lead­ing to a de­cline in trade for the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“This con­trib­uted to the weak­en­ing of the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar com­pared with stronger cur­ren­cies, like the Dan­ish kro­ner and Swiss franc,” he added.</p>
    <p>In Asia, Sin­ga­pore re­tains its No. 6 po­si­tion from last year.</p>
    <p>Top on the list in Asia is Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Even as the Chi­nese city grap­ples with on­go­ing po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty, Hong Kong owes its sta­tus as the most ex­pen­sive city for ex­pa­tri­ates to its “ex­cep­tion­ally high hous­ing costs”, said Mr Quane.</p>
    <p>Other Asian cities in the top 10 global rank­ings are Tokyo (No. 2), Seoul (No. 8) and Yoko­hama (No. 10).</p>
    <p>ECA In­ter­na­tional as­sesses the cost of liv­ing in cities for non-lo­cal em­ploy­ees based on a bas­ket of con­sumer goods and ser­vices, such as gro­ceries and leisure ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>For this year’s sur­vey, cost of liv­ing re­search was com­bined with ac­com­mo­da­tion data into one in­dex even though the data sets were pre­vi­ously sep­a­rated, said an ECA In­ter­na­tional spokesman.</p>
    <p>“As such, the 2019 rank­ings... have been ret­ro­spec­tively up­dated,” he added.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has also not spared cities in Thai­land and Viet­nam, with the sur­vey show­ing that Thai and Viet­namese lo­ca­tions have slipped at least 10 places in the rank­ings this year.</p>
    <p>“The Thai baht and Viet­namese dong weak­ened sig­nif­i­cantly against other ma­jor cur­ren­cies dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, partly due to a ma­jor blow to the tourism in­dus­try as fewer vis­i­tors trav­elled to the re­gion. Rental costs also fell due to the weaker de­mand,” said Mr Quane.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Euro­pean cities have risen in the rank­ings as un­cer­tainty around Brexit has sub­sided this year com­pared with last year.</p>
    <p>An­other fac­tor that has brought about changes in this year’s rank­ings is the col­lapse of oil prices.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, coun­tries heav­ily re­liant on oil, such as Brazil, Rus­sia and Venezuela, have seen weaker cur­ren­cies and a down­swing in their economies.</p>
