    <p>The dan­ger lurk­ing in China’s debt­laden real es­tate sec­tor was never so clear as late last month, when word of a pos­si­ble cash crunch at China Ever­grande Group, the world’s most in­debted prop­erty de­vel­oper, sent in­vestors run­ning for the exit.</p>
    <p>With seven more of the 10 mostin­debted de­vel­op­ers also based in China, pol­i­cy­mak­ers in Bei­jing have drafted what state-run me­dia is call­ing “three red lines” – met­rics on debt that de­vel­op­ers will have to meet if they want to bor­row more.</p>
    <p>The new ap­proach prom­ises to be a game changer for a sec­tor that ac­counts for about 29 per cent of eco­nomic out­put.</p>
    <p>HOW WILL IT WORK?</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple’s Bank of China and the Min­istry of Hous­ing an­nounced in Au­gust that they had drafted new fi­nanc­ing rules for real es­tate com­pa­nies. De­vel­op­ers want­ing to re­fi­nance will be assessed against three red lines, or thresh­olds.</p>
    <p>There will be a 70 per cent ceil­ing on li­a­bil­i­ties to as­sets, ex­clud­ing ad­vance pro­ceeds from projects sold on con­tract; a 100 per cent cap on net debt to eq­uity; and they must have a cash to short-term bor­row­ing ra­tio of at least one.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers will be cat­e­gorised based on how many lim­its they breach, and their debt growth will be capped ac­cord­ingly. If all three are breached, the com­pany will not be al­lowed to in­crease its debt in the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>If it passes all three, it can raise its debt a max­i­mum of 15 per cent in the next year. As the reg­u­la­tor has not an­nounced its of­fi­cial cal­cu­la­tions, some def­i­ni­tions are not clear.</p>
    <p>WHY DRAW THE LINES?</p>
    <p>A big part is fear of an­other hous­ing bub­ble – and a dis­as­trous bust.</p>
    <p>Home prices have surged six­fold over the past 15 years, mak­ing cities such as Shen­zhen less af­ford­able than Lon­don.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese builders’ debt binge has been an im­por­tant driver of ris­ing prices, forc­ing them to charge more to cover a ris­ing in­ter­est bur­den. Po­ten­tial buy­ers re­turned en masse as the pan­demic crunch eased, keep­ing pres­sure on prices de­spite the global eco­nomic slow­down.</p>
    <p>The worry is that China could re­peat Ja­pan’s mis­take in the 1990s of not rein­ing in ex­ces­sive credit and shut­ting down in­sol­vent bor­row­ers quickly enough, caus­ing long-term dam­age to growth.</p>
    <p>Even be­fore Ever­grande’s brief liq­uid­ity scare, con­cern had in­ten­si­fied af­ter Ta­hoe Group in July be­came the first large res­i­den­tial de­vel­oper in the coun­try to de­fault on a bond in five years. Guangzhou R&F Prop­er­ties and Ocean­wide Hold­ings have also shown signs of stress in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>WHEN WILL IT BE­GIN?</p>
    <p>There is no timetable yet. But the Eco­nomic In­for­ma­tion Daily re­ported that a dozen de­vel­op­ers, in­clud­ing Ever­grande, China Vanke and Coun­try Gar­den Hold­ings, had been picked for a pi­lot scheme that re­quired them to sub­mit a three­year debt-re­duc­tion plan. Full im­ple­men­ta­tion across the res­i­den­tial sec­tor would be­gin next year, it said.</p>
    <p>Xinhua News Agency re­ported that reg­u­la­tors im­posed the red lines and other quan­ti­ta­tive lim­its at an Aug 20 meet­ing with de­vel­op­ers, in an­other sig­nal that they are mov­ing ahead. The cen­tral bank’s deputy gov­er­nor Pan Gong­sheng said last month that there would be a “rea­son­able tran­si­tional pe­riod” for the pol­icy’s adop­tion.</p>
    <p>WHAT’S THE IM­PLI­CA­TION FOR DE­VEL­OP­ERS?</p>
    <p>In the near term, a de­vel­oper with a weak bal­ance sheet and size­able ex­po­sure to sec­ond-tier cities may need to cut home prices to boost sales and shore up cash.</p>
    <p>This is ev­i­dent in Ever­grande’s lat­est cam­paign to of­fer dis­counts of as much as 30 per cent – its deep­est cuts ever. It may also spur waves of eq­uity sales and spin-offs of non­core busi­nesses such as prop­erty man­age­ment ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Over the longer term, it may force de­vel­op­ers to de­vote more re­sources to non-res­i­den­tial prop­erty, such as of­fice and re­tail.</p>
    <p>WHICH FIRMS WILL BE MOST AF­FECTED?</p>
    <p>Among the ma­jor play­ers, Ever­grande and Guangzhou R&F Prop­er­ties fall short on all three met­rics and face the most pres­sure to cut debt quickly. They may need to cut bor­row­ing by 19 and 21 per­cent­age points, re­spec­tively, un­der the new rule, based on their 2019 fi­nances.</p>
    <p>Sunac China Hold­ings, which meets only one met­ric, may need to pare back debt by 35 per­cent­age points. Among China’s 189 listed de­vel­op­ers, 14 were in breach of the three red lines as at early this month.</p>
    <p>Among the big­gest by mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion were Zhong­tian Fi­nan­cial Group, Ocean­wide and LVGEM China Real Es­tate In­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>More than half of the Hong Konglisted de­vel­op­ers passed all three red line tests, in­clud­ing Coun­try Gar­den and Vanke.</p>
    <p>WILL IT CRUSH THE ECON­OMY?</p>
    <p>Prob­a­bly not. De­vel­op­ers’ debt growth had al­ready been slow­ing – from 53 per cent in 2017 to 16 per cent last year. That is not far from the caps im­posed on firms that pass the red lines test. As China’s real es­tate de­vel­op­ment in­vest­ment has grown about 10 per cent in the past two years, there will be room for a mild delever­ag­ing, or debt re­duc­tion.</p>
