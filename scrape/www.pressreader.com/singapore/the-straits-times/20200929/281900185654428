    <p>Ruth Bader Gins­burg be­came, late in her long and il­lus­tri­ous ca­reer, more than just a United States Supreme Court jus­tice. She was a cul­tural sym­bol, a hu­man dis­til­la­tion of an era and a cause, her special celebrity rooted in the way her fight for le­gal op­por­tu­ni­ties for women com­bined with her own ex­tra­or­di­nary suc­cess in the spheres she opened up.</p>
    <p>As a ju­rist, she was one of the court’s four lib­er­als, im­por­tant but not sin­gu­lar; as the No­to­ri­ous RBG, she em­bod­ied lib­eral fem­i­nism, a his­tory of strug­gle and achieve­ment con­densed into three ini­tials and one life.</p>
    <p>Mrs Amy Coney Bar­rett, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s choice to take her seat, is a sig­ni­fier of a dif­fer­ent sort.</p>
    <p>In her com­bi­na­tion of elite ac­com­plish­ment with a faith and a fam­ily life that’s un­usual among her high-achiev­ing peers, what she con­denses isn’t the re­cent his­tory of fem­i­nism but a ques­tion that its suc­cess has cre­ated: Namely, can there be a con­ser­va­tive fem­i­nism that’s dis­tinc­tive, co­her­ent and in­flu­en­tial, at least be­yond quirky re­li­gious sub­cul­tures like the fac­ulty at the Univer­sity of Notre Dame?</p>
    <p>By con­ser­va­tive fem­i­nism I mean some­thing dif­fer­ent from</p>
    <p>1970s-era fe­male re­sis­tance to the women’s move­ment, whether in its arch Joan Did­ion form or its mass-move­ment Phyl­lis Sch­lafly in­car­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Mrs Sch­lafly’s anti-fem­i­nism, the core women’s con­ser­vatism of the 1970s, ar­gued that the push for fe­male ad­vance­ment was ei­ther un­nec­es­sary or de­struc­tive, that it gave women things they didn’t re­ally need and it took from them – from moth­ers, es­pe­cially – pro­tec­tions that they re­lied upon.</p>
    <p>Its icon was the be­lea­guered home­maker; the fact that Mrs Sch­lafly was her­self such a vig­or­ously public fig­ure didn’t change her fun­da­men­tal iden­tity as a de­fender of the do­mes­tic sphere.</p>
    <p>A con­ser­va­tive fem­i­nism to­day, on the other hand – again, if we can say that it ex­ists – is adap­tive rather than op­po­si­tional.</p>
    <p>It takes for granted that much of what Jus­tice Gins­burg fought for was nec­es­sary and just; that the old or­der sup­pressed fe­male tal­ent and am­bi­tion; that sex­ism and misog­yny are more po­tent forces than many anti-fem­i­nists al­lowed.</p>
    <p>It agrees that the ac­com­plish­ments of Mrs Bar­rett’s ca­reer – in academia and now on the fed­eral bench – could have been de­nied to her in 1950, and it hails that change as good.</p>
    <p>But then it also ar­gues that fem­i­nism’s vic­to­ries were some­what un­bal­anced, that they were kinder to pro­fes­sional am­bi­tion than to other hu­man as­pi­ra­tions, and that the so­ci­ety they forged has lost its equi­lib­rium not just in work-life bal­ance but also in other ar­eas – sex and ro­mance and mar­riage and child rear­ing, with the sexes in­creas­ingly alien­ated from each other and too many chil­dren de­sired but never born.</p>
    <p>This di­ag­no­sis is not nec­es­sar­ily con­ser­va­tive; some of it might be en­dorsed by more rad­i­cal fem­i­nists, for whom the alien­ation and dis­ap­point­ment are proof that en­dur­ing fea­tures of pa­tri­archy and cap­i­tal­ism still need to be abol­ished.</p>
    <p>The con­ser­va­tive pre­scrip­tion, though, is not to march deeper into Karl Marx or Dr Ju­dith But­ler but to in­te­grate fem­i­nist in­sights with ideas from the old regime about the cen­tral­ity of mar­riage, chil­dren and re­li­gious com­mit­ment to the good life.</p>
    <p>This at­tempted in­te­gra­tion doesn’t have a sin­gle dom­i­nant the­o­rist – its the­o­ris­ing prob­a­bly peaked in the 1990s with writ­ers like Bar­bara Dafoe White­head – but it has many Amer­i­can em­bod­i­ments: pro­fes­sional women across the coun­try (and, by ex­ten­sion, many hus­bands in their dual-earner homes) whose life cour­ses gen­er­ally re­sem­ble those of the rest of their class, but with cer­tain choices that seem some­what more ec­cen­tric or askew.</p>
    <p>That means shorter dat­ing lives and ear­lier mar­riages, four or five chil­dren in­stead of two or fewer, and other more tra­di­tion­ally coded choices – more fre­quent church­go­ing, denser so­cial net­works, liv­ing closer to ex­tended fam­ily, work lives de­signed more around home life than the re­verse.</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son with the av­er­age ed­u­cated woman’s life tra­jec­tory 80 years ago, these women look like Jus­tice Gins­burg’s heirs.</p>
    <p>By com­par­i­son with the most prom­i­nent con­tem­po­rary avatars of lib­eral fem­i­nism, how­ever – in­clud­ing Jus­tice Gins­burg’s fel­low fe­male jus­tices and the Demo­cratic nom­i­nee for vice-pres­i­dent – they look some­what more like Mrs Bar­rett, even if the size of her fam­ily (seven chil­dren) and the scale of her pro­fes­sional suc­cess make her an out­lier in al­most any com­pany.</p>
    <p>This means that, if el­e­vated to the Supreme Court, she will prob­a­bly en­joy more celebrity than the typ­i­cal jus­tice. She’ll be more of an RBG-style cul­tural sym­bol – as ACB, Glo­ri­ous or No­to­ri­ous – with her own dis­tinc­tive, if con­sid­er­ably smaller, fan base, plus a cer­tain type of critic who re­gards her fe­cun­dity as threat­en­ing or ir­re­spon­si­ble, her claim to any kind of fem­i­nism a cheat. (Ob­vi­ously, if she plays a role in chang­ing the court’s abor­tion ju­rispru­dence, the lat­ter an­tag­o­nism will be sharp­ened.)</p>
    <p>This is a sub­stan­tial bur­den to im­pose on any public fig­ure, let alone a mum with teenagers, and for con­ser­va­tives who are ready to put her ini­tials on a bumper sticker, two cau­tions are in or­der.</p>
    <p>First, hu­man be­ings don’t al­ways bear the weight that iden­tity pol­i­tics im­poses on them, some­thing that’s all too clear from the arc of the last great fe­male con­ser­va­tive hope, a cer­tain erst­while Alaska gov­er­nor.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, one rea­son that con­ser­va­tive fem­i­nism as I’ve de­scribed it doesn’t play a sub­stan­tial role in US pol­i­tics right now is that it hasn’t been dis­tilled into a com­pelling pol­icy agenda – pro-woman, pro-mother, pro-work-life bal­ance – by its in­creas­ingly male-dom­i­nated con­ser­va­tive party. (An­other rea­son, of course, is that this party is led by Mr Trump.)</p>
    <p>There are ef­forts to change this, in­clud­ing an in­ter­est­ing con­ser­va­tive at­tempt to draw on the work of Mrs El­iz­a­beth Warren from her pre-Se­nate, more right-of-cen­tre days, but they haven’t come to fruition.</p>
    <p>And an orig­i­nal­ist jus­tice with a lim­ited view of the ju­di­ciary’s am­bit, which is what Mrs Bar­rett prom­ises to be, is prob­a­bly not go­ing to be the leader that this ef­fort needs, how­ever much her per­sonal story seems to em­body its pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Hence the rea­son­able test for any con­ser­vatism that takes Mrs Bar­rett for its avatar: What is it do­ing in its pol­i­cy­mak­ing to make her kind of life, pro­fes­sion­ally im­pres­sive and per­son­ally full, feel more avail­able and af­ford­able and imag­in­able for women who aren’t nom­i­nated to the Supreme Court?</p>
