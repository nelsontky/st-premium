    <p>The SG Clean pro­gramme, launched by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) in Fe­bru­ary, ral­lies lo­cal busi­nesses and the pub­lic to adopt good per­sonal habits, be so­cially re­spon­si­ble and raise clean­li­ness and hy­giene stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Other govern­ment agen­cies such as the Singapore Tourism Board and En­ter­prise Singapore have joined the pro­gramme to en­cour­age own­ers of premises across var­i­ous sec­tors to main­tain high stan­dards of pub­lic hy­giene at their premises.</p>
    <p>SG Clean-cer­ti­fied busi­nesses are pre­sented with the SG Clean cer­ti­fi­ca­tion, the na­tional mark of ex­cel­lence for clean­li­ness, hy­giene and sani­ti­sa­tion prac­tices. This in­di­cates that the SG Clean-cer­ti­fied busi­ness has met strict cer­ti­fi­ca­tion re­quire­ments and is pre­pared to man­age vis­i­tors and risk lev­els safely.</p>
    <p>The SG Clean pro­gramme is a vol­un­tary scheme. By opt­ing to be SG Clean-cer­ti­fied, lo­cal busi­nesses are pro­vid­ing re­as­sur­ance and demon­strat­ing their com­mit­ment to step up mea­sures to help re­duce pub­lic health risks and pre­vent fur­ther com­mu­nity spread of in­fec­tious diseases.</p>
    <p>Sani­ti­sa­tion and hy­giene check­lists and ad­vi­sories, in ad­di­tion to strin­gent and rig­or­ous checks to safe­guard pub­lic health, are an im­por­tant part of the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion process.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses must meet sec­tor-spe­cific re­quire­ments and op­er­a­tions laid out in these check­lists and ad­vi­sories, which in­clude man­age­ment over­sight, in­creased fre­quency of dis­in­fec­tion for com­mon fa­cil­i­ties, en­sur­ing em­ploy­ees’ good per­sonal hy­giene and the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s com­pli­ance to govern­ment or­ders and ad­vi­sories.</p>
    <p>Third-party as­ses­sors will eval­u­ate lo­cal busi­nesses to en­sure that they meet the nec­es­sary re­quire­ments. If all the re­quire­ments in the check­list are met, they will re­ceive the SG Clean qual­ity mark.</p>
    <p>Checks will also be made to en­sure that premise op­er­a­tors are up­hold­ing and main­tain­ing high stan­dards of hy­giene.</p>
    <p>The SG Clean cer­ti­fi­ca­tion is a col­lec­tive ef­fort to pro­vide vis­i­tors and lo­cals with peace of mind and re­store pub­lic con­fi­dence in the clean­li­ness and hy­giene stan­dards of premises.</p>
    <p>With this cer­ti­fi­ca­tion, you are as­sured that an es­tab­lish­ment has im­ple­mented safe man­age­ment mea­sures and met strict re­quire­ments of the SG Clean pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>SG Clean-cer­ti­fied premises are awarded the SG Clean qual­ity mark, a sig­na­ture green smi­ley face logo, which is dis­played at prom­i­nent ar­eas, such as at en­trances and by coun­ters, within the premises.</p>
    <p>To date, more than 20,000 in­di­vid­ual premises have been cer­ti­fied SG Clean by NEA , the Singapore Food Agency, Singapore Tourism Board and En­ter­prise Singapore.</p>
    <p>Of these, over 1,200 have been is­sued to tourism premises as well as food and bev­er­age and re­tail out­lets in tourism premises and Sen­tosa. You may find the list of cer­ti­fied es­tab­lish­ments here: https://www.sg­clean.gov.sg</p>
    <p>The re­cent slew of Covid-19 mea­sures were an­nounced via broad­cast to give busi­nesses and work­ers clar­ity on the Govern­ment’s plans to sup­port them be­fore the open­ing of Par­lia­ment, Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Rajah said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She added that the mea­sures would still be sub­jected to par­lia­men­tary scru­tiny and the Govern­ment would re­main ac­count­able.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat had an­nounced the lat­est mea­sures to help Sin­ga­pore­ans amid the Covid-19 pan­demic in a min­is­te­rial state­ment which was broad­cast last Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The $8 bil­lion worth of mea­sures in­clude ex­tend­ing the Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which would have ended this month, as well as ex­tend­ing ap­pli­ca­tions for the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant meant for Sin­ga­pore­ans who were laid off or suf­fered sig­nif­i­cant in­come loss.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee added that the early an­nounce­ment would give MPs and mem­bers of the pub­lic enough time to ab­sorb the con­tent of the state­ment ahead of the open­ing of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>She said that though Par­lia­ment of­fi­cially opens to­day, there will not be a chance for a min­is­te­rial state­ment at this sit­ting, which is taken up with the elec­tion of the Speaker, swear­ing in of MPs and de­liv­ery of the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>The first busi­ness sit­ting of Par­lia­ment will take place on Aug 31, with MPs delv­ing straight into the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>“If we de­liver the min­is­te­rial state­ment on Aug 31 it­self, MPs won’t have enough time to re­flect on the mea­sures be­fore the de­bate,” said Ms In­dra­nee, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Fi­nance and for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment. “Also, with the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress be­ing de­liv­ered on Aug 24, there will be a lot of sub­stan­tive things for MPs and the pub­lic to con­sider be­tween Aug 24 and 31.”</p>
    <p>Hence, the best op­tion was to de­liver the min­is­te­rial state­ment via broad­cast be­fore Par­lia­ment opened, said Ms In­dra­nee.</p>
    <p>In the com­ing months, the Govern­ment will seek par­lia­men­tary ap­proval for its re­vised spend­ing plans to give ef­fect to the mea­sures in the min­is­te­rial state­ment.</p>
    <p>This will be done through a sup­ple­men­tary sup­ply Bill, which will go through the usual par­lia­men­tary pro­ceed­ings and will have to be as­sented to by the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee said: “The Govern­ment re­mains ac­count­able and all is still fully in ac­cor­dance with good gov­er­nance. It is just that we put it out sooner rather than later be­cause it af­fects peo­ple’s wel­fare and well-be­ing, and we wanted to give enough time for proper scru­tiny and de­lib­er­a­tion.”</p>
