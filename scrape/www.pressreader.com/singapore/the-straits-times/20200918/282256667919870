    <p>LON­DON • Liver­pool have reached an agree­ment to sign Span­ish mid­fielder Thi­ago Al­can­tara from Bay­ern Mu­nich, the Ger­man club’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Karl-Heinz Rum­menigge said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood the Reds would pay an ini­tial fee of £20 mil­lion (S$35 mil­lion) for the player, who has one year re­main­ing on his con­tract at Bay­ern, with £5 mil­lion to fol­low in add-ons. He is set to sign a four-year deal at An­field. The 29-year-old missed Bay­ern’s train­ing ses­sion yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to re­ports in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>Rum­menigge told Ger­man daily Bild yes­ter­day: “I can con­firm that Bay­ern has fi­nally reached an agree­ment with Liver­pool. It was Thi­ago’s great wish to do some­thing new again at the end of his ca­reer.”</p>
    <p>Bay­ern coach Hansi Flick added:</p>
    <p>“Thi­ago was an ex­cep­tional player for seven years for Bay­ern Mu­nich.</p>
    <p>“The way he played he gave many op­tions to the team, he was a sur­pris­ing player be­cause he solved prob­lems in ways peo­ple did not ex­pect...</p>
    <p>“I con­grat­u­late (Liver­pool coach Jurgen) Klopp. He gets a top player and a sen­sa­tional per­son.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing come through Barcelona’s youth sys­tem and made 100 ap­pear­ances for the se­nior side, Thi­ago moved to Bay­ern in 2013 when the Ger­man club ap­pointed Pep Guardi­ola, be­com­ing a vi­tal cog in cen­tral mid­field.</p>
    <p>The Spain in­ter­na­tional played in last sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal vic­tory over Paris Saint-Ger­main. That was the 16th tro­phy he won with the Bavar­ian giants.</p>
    <p>It had been re­ported a po­ten­tial move for Thi­ago was be­ing held up by un­cer­tainty over the fu­ture of Liver­pool mid­fielder Ge­orginio Wi­j­nal­dum. The Dutch­man, who is in the fi­nal year of his con­tract at An­field, has been linked with Barcelona.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool, how­ever, have de­cided to make their move for Thi­ago now. He would be the club’s sec­ond sign­ing of the sum­mer trans­fer win­dow and a more sig­nif­i­cant ac­qui­si­tion than that of Greece left­back Kostas Tsimikas, who will pro­vide cover for Andy Robert­son.</p>
    <p>Thi­ago would likely play a key role in mid­field for Klopp.</p>
    <p>As re­ported by Sky Sports, he av­er­aged 82.6 com­pleted passes per 90 min­utes in the Bun­desliga last sea­son – the most of any mid­fielder. He also had a pass com­ple­tion rate in ex­cess of 90 per cent – with both feet.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool’s build-up play starts from the cen­tre of de­fence to the full-backs, who will then raid for­ward to link up with the at­tack­ers.</p>
    <p>The role of their mid­field­ers, in turn, is to cover those ad­vances, recycle pos­ses­sion and prevent a counter-at­tack.</p>
    <p>The team, how­ever, are lack­ing a mid­field mae­stro who can take full con­trol in the mid­dle of the park.</p>
    <p>Thi­ago, who won two La Liga ti­tles with Barcelona, is a player who can keep pos­ses­sion and dis­trib­ute the ball well. He could help Liver­pool by mov­ing the ball around and open up games against de­fences who sit back.</p>
    <p>When the Reds are un­able to find a break­through with their wide ap­proach due to op­po­nents’ tight de­fences, he would be one to pick passes that other Liver­pool mid­field­ers are less likely to do so.</p>
    <p>When asked about a po­ten­tial move for Thi­ago last week, Klopp said: “Did I men­tion that Thi­ago Al­can­tara is a re­ally good player? Long time ago. It is nice that we are linked with him... it is be­cause he is a good player and Liver­pool is a big club, so that is nice.”</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing yes­ter­day’s news, for­mer Liver­pool de­fender Jamie Car­ragher, now a pun­dit for Sky, also be­lieves that Thi­ago could add an­other di­men­sion to Klopp’s mid­field.</p>
    <p>He said: “Liver­pool have got five or six mid­field play­ers – they ro­tate well be­cause they need en­ergy in that po­si­tion – but a lot of the play­ers are pretty sim­i­lar.</p>
    <p>“Thi­ago would be some­thing dif­fer­ent – less in en­ergy but more tech­ni­cal – and I think he would be a re­ally good ad­di­tion.”</p>
