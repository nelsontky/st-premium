    <p>South-east Asia’s largest bank DBS will launch a dig­i­tal cur­rency ex­change that will al­low in­vestors to trade in cryp­tocur­ren­cies and firms to raise funds through as­set to­keni­sa­tion. The crypto ex­change is ex­pected to start trad­ing as early as next week, while the se­cu­ri­ties plat­form will be set up in the next few months.</p>
    <p>The blockchain-based DBS Dig­i­tal Ex­change will al­low in­sti­tu­tional and ac­cred­ited in­vestors to ac­cess an in­te­grated to­keni­sa­tion, trad­ing and cus­tody ecosys­tem for dig­i­tal as­sets.</p>
    <p>It will pro­vide a reg­u­lated plat­form for the is­suance and trad­ing of dig­i­tal to­kens backed by fi­nan­cial as­sets such as shares in un­listed com­pa­nies, bonds and pri­vate eq­uity funds. Its dig­i­tal cus­tody ser­vices will hold cryp­to­graphic keys that con­trol dig­i­tal as­sets on be­half of clients.</p>
    <p>The ser­vice will also en­able spot ex­changes be­tween four fiat currencies – the Sin­ga­pore dol­lar, US dol­lar, Hong Kong dol­lar and Ja­panese yen – and four es­tab­lished cryp­tocur­ren­cies – bit­coin, ether, bit­coin cash and XRP.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Ex­change will take a 10 per cent stake in the DBS</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal Ex­change.</p>
    <p>The bank has re­ceived in-prin­ci­ple ap­proval from the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore for DBS Dig­i­tal Ex­change to op­er­ate or­gan­ised mar­kets for as­sets such as shares, bonds and pri­vate eq­uity funds.</p>
    <p>DBS chief Piyush Gupta said yes­ter­day that the bank’s size and ca­pa­bil­i­ties al­low it to build vol­ume and liq­uid­ity, and scale the ex­change in a way that is dif­fi­cult for be­spoke dig­i­tal ex­changes.</p>
    <p>The ex­change pre­sents a huge op­por­tu­nity for DBS to grow its pres­ence in a large mar­ket, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gupta said: “Over the last few years, the pri­vate cap­i­tal mar­ket has been grow­ing ex­po­nen­tially</p>
    <p>and more com­pa­nies would rather stay pri­vate than go pub­lic... A large chunk of funds is now be­ing raised in Asia. The fact that there is a lot of pri­vate cap­i­tal lends it­self to the pos­si­bil­ity of mon­etis­ing</p>
    <p>and cre­at­ing liq­uid­ity in it.”</p>
    <p>The global daily trad­ing value on the world’s dig­i­tal ex­changes ranged from US$50 bil­lion (S$66.8 bil­lion) to US$100 bil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>This is not DBS’ first foray into dig­i­tal as­sets. In May, it joined lo­cal blockchain trade-fi­nance net­work Con­tour, which dig­i­talises global trade pro­cesses such as the cre­ation, ex­change, ap­proval and is­suance of letters of credit.</p>
    <p>Last year, it also launched its first multi-tier fi­nanc­ing fa­cil­ity on a lo­gis­tics blockchain plat­form to help small and medium-sized en­ter­prises in China get faster ac­cess to trade fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>SGX-backed digi­tised se­cu­ri­ties plat­form iSTOX wel­comed DBS’ entry into the dig­i­tal as­sets space.</p>
    <p>Ms Choo Oi Yee, its chief com­mer­cial of­fi­cer, said: “With in­creas­ing adop­tion glob­ally, we ex­pect to see more in­sti­tu­tional play­ers turn­ing to digi­tised se­cu­ri­ties as their pri­mary mode of is­su­ing new eq­uity and bonds, and more in­vestors build­ing port­fo­lios that con­sist of di­ver­si­fied digi­tised in­vest­ment products.”</p>
