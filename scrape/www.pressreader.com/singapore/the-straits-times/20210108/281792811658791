    <p>BEI­JING • Trans­port ser­vices were cut off to a city of 11 mil­lion peo­ple near Bei­jing yes­ter­day as lo­cal of­fi­cials were rep­ri­manded for a Covid-19 out­break that pushed China’s new in­fec­tions to the high­est sin­gle-day tally since last July.</p>
    <p>The virus first emerged in cen­tral China in late 2019, but since then, the au­thor­i­ties have largely brought the sit­u­a­tion un­der con­trol through travel re­stric­tions, strict lockdowns and mass test­ing.</p>
    <p>But a re­cent out­break in the coun­try’s north­ern He­bei prov­ince, which sur­rounds Bei­jing, has seen cases spike and prompted mass test­ing, school clo­sures and sus­pen­sion of travel links to the prov­ince.</p>
    <p>There were 51 more cases re­ported in He­bei yes­ter­day, the Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion said, and another 69 asymp­to­matic cases.</p>
    <p>The vast ma­jor­ity of in­bound and out­bound flights to the city of Shi­ji­azhuang were can­celled by yes­ter­day after­noon, ac­cord­ing to real-time flight tracker Var­iF­light, and trains were sus­pended from leav­ing Shi­ji­azhuang sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor high­ways l ead­ing i nto Shi­ji­azhuang, around 300km south of Bei­jing, have been closed and in­ter­city bus travel halted.</p>
    <p>State me­dia tabloid Global Times re­ported that the city was in “de facto lock­down” due to the large-scale sus­pen­sion of trans­port ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“I did the nu­cleic acid test last night, but don’t have the re­sults yet. Without it I can’t leave the city,” one young woman at Shi­ji­azhuang train sta­tion told state broad­caster CCTV.</p>
    <p>Three of­fi­cials from Shi­ji­azhuang’s Gaocheng dis­trict – the epi­cen­tre of the lat­est out­break – were rep­ri­manded for their han­dling of the out­break, the lo­cal dis­ci­plinary com­mis­sion said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cials had al­lowed a woman who had tested pos­i­tive to leave the area, the com­mis­sion said.</p>
    <p>Gaocheng dis­trict has been de­clared high risk and sealed off, and the au­thor­i­ties said tens of thou­sands have al­ready been tested for the virus.</p>
    <p>There were 63 new Covid-19 in­fec­tions in the Chi­nese main­land yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing 11 im­ported cases.</p>
