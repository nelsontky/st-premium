    <p>NEW YORK • The fast-spread­ing coro­n­avirus has left the world still reel­ing from its trail of dev­as­ta­tion, even though it has been one year since the mys­te­ri­ous pathogen first re­vealed it­self in China.</p>
    <p>Barely al­lowed to catch its breath, the world saw its daily deaths reach record highs last week, while in­fec­tions i n the United States crossed 20 mil­lion, al­most twice as many as sec­ond­worst-hit coun­try In­dia.</p>
    <p>The US has floun­dered in its ef­forts to quell the virus, which is spread­ing rapidly across the coun­try and has al­ready caused more than 347,000 deaths – by far the high­est na­tional death toll.</p>
    <p>World­wide hopes that Covid-19 vac­cines will bring a rapid end to the pan­demic in 2021 have been shaken by the slow start to the US vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme, which has been be­set by lo­gis­ti­cal prob­lems and over­stretched hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>Nearly 2.8 mil­lion peo­ple in the US have al­ready re­ceived their first jabs, but the fig­ure fell well be­hind the 20 mil­lion in­oc­u­la­tions that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion promised by the end of last year.</p>
    <p>The des­per­ate race to vac­ci­nate is set to dom­i­nate this year, with the coro­n­avirus al­ready hav­ing killed at least 1.8 mil­lion peo­ple since it was first iden­ti­fied in the Chi­nese city of Wuhan in De­cem­ber 2019.</p>
    <p>Ger­man firm BioNTech said it was rac­ing to ramp up pro­duc­tion of its Covid-19 jab to fill a short­age left by the lack of other ap­proved vac­cines in Europe. Coun­tries in­clud­ing Bri­tain, Canada and the US ap­proved the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine ear­lier and have since also green-lighted jabs by US firm Moderna or As­traZeneca-Ox­ford.</p>
    <p>“The cur­rent sit­u­a­tion is not rosy, there’s a hole be­cause there’s an ab­sence of other ap­proved vac­cines and we have to fill this gap,” BioNTech co-founder Ugur Sahin told Der Spiegel weekly.</p>
    <p>Crit­i­cism of the slow pace of the vac­cine roll-out has grown louder. In Ger­many, se­nior doc­tors have com­plained that hospi­tal staff are left wait­ing for vac­cines de­spite be­ing in a pri­or­ity group.</p>
    <p>France has seen sim­i­lar com­plaints, prompt­ing the govern­ment to an­nounce that health work­ers over 50 could get the shot from to­mor­row – sooner than orig­i­nally planned.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts at In­dia’s drugs reg­u­la­tors have rec­om­mended for emer­gency use two coro­n­avirus vac­cines, one de­vel­oped by As­traZeneca and Ox­ford Univer­sity and the other backed by a staterun in­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries from Ja­pan to South Africa also ended 2020 with record daily cases at 4,520 and 17,710 re­spec­tively. Tokyo, along with three neigh­bour­ing re­gions, yes­ter­day asked Ja­pan’s cen­tral govern­ment to de­clare a new state of emer­gency as the coun­try bat­tles a third wave of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Tokyo re­ported more than 1,300 new cases, far ex­ceed­ing the pre­vi­ous high of 949 cases set late last month.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan im­posed its first state of emer­gency in spring.</p>
    <p>From to­mor­row, all pri­mary schools in Lon­don, which has one of the coun­try’s high­est lev­els of Covid-19 in­fec­tions per capita, shall re­main closed for the start of the new term.</p>
    <p>One of the worst-hit coun­tries in the world, Bri­tain is bat­tling a new wave of a virus that has al­ready killed more than 74,000 peo­ple and crushed the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts be­lieve the worst is yet to come glob­ally, pre­dict­ing a sharp rise in cases and deaths af­ter weeks of hol­i­day gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • United States Se­na­tor Mitt Rom­ney has urged the fed­eral govern­ment to im­me­di­ately en­list vet­eri­nar­i­ans, com­bat medics and oth­ers in an all-out na­tional cam­paign to ad­min­is­ter coro­n­avirus vac­ci­na­tions and slow a surg­ing rise in Covid-19 hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions and deaths.</p>
    <p>The Utah Repub­li­can, who ran un­suc­cess­fully for pres­i­dent as his party’s nom­i­nee in 2012, called for greater ac­tion as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion fell far short of its goal of vac­ci­nat­ing 20 mil­lion Amer­i­cans with a first of two re­quired doses by the end of last year.</p>
    <p>As at Fri­day, the first day of the new year, an estimated 2.8 mil­lion vac­cine doses had ac­tu­ally been given, mostly to front-line health­care work­ers, as well as staff and res­i­dents of nurs­ing fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“That com­pre­hen­sive vac­ci­na­tion plans have not been de­vel­oped at the fed­eral level and sent to the states as models is as in­com­pre­hen­si­ble as it is in­ex­cus­able,” Mr Rom­ney said, in a state­ment on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The tally of known US in­fec­tions reached another som­bre mile­stone on Fri­day, sur­pass­ing 20 mil­lion confirmed cases since the start of the pan­demic, and the num­ber of hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients ex­ceeded 125,000, set­ting a daily record once more.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia, the most pop­u­lous state with 40 mil­lion res­i­dents, has be­come a lead­ing US flash­point of the pan­demic de­spite some of the na­tion’s tough­est re­stric­tions on so­cial gath­er­ings and busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The soar­ing Covid-19 case load has pushed hos­pi­tals in and around Los An­ge­les in par­tic­u­lar to their lim­its, fill­ing emer­gency rooms, in­ten­sive care units, am­bu­lance bays and morgues be­yond ca­pac­ity, and cre­at­ing staff short­ages.</p>
    <p>Brief­ing re­porters on Thurs­day, Ms Cathy Chidester, di­rec­tor of the Los An­ge­les County Emer­gency Med­i­cal Ser­vices Agency, called the sit­u­a­tion a “hid­den dis­as­ter”, not plainly vis­i­ble to the public.</p>
    <p>Med­i­cal ex­perts at­tribute the wors­en­ing pan­demic in re­cent weeks to the ar­rival of colder weather and the fail­ure of many Amer­i­cans to abide by public health warn­ings and re­quire­ments to stay home.</p>
