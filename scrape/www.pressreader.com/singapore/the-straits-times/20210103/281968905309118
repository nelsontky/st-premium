    <p>Work­ers’ Party (WP) MPs He Ting Ru and Raeesah Khan started the new year by wel­com­ing new ad­di­tions to their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>For Ms He, 37, it was a boy, while Ms Raeesah, 27, gave birth to a girl.</p>
    <p>Both women are MPs for the four-mem­ber Sengkang GRC, and an­nounced the news on their re­spec­tive Face­book pages.</p>
    <p>“We had a rocky start but both of us are re­cov­er­ing well,” wrote Ms Raeesah in a post early yes­ter­day, shar­ing a pic­ture of her­self, her hus­band and her new­born daugh­ter Ayla. “Thank you for all your well wishes.”</p>
    <p>Ayla is Ms Raeesah’s se­cond child.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ms He an­nounced the news on her Face­book page on New Year’s Eve.</p>
    <p>“What a splen­did way to wrap off 2020 with the lat­est ad­di­tion to our fam­ily mak­ing his grand en­trance!” she wrote.</p>
    <p>Ms He, who has two other sons aged about two and three, posted a photo of her­self and her new­born to­gether with her fel­low Sengkang GRC MPs, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim and Mr Louis Chua.</p>
    <p>The duo had vis­ited her ear­lier in the day, she said, adding: “In­cred­i­bly lucky and blessed to have them and the rest of Team WP do­ing the heavy lift­ing, es­pe­cially over the next few months.”</p>
    <p>WP chief Pri­tam Singh said in a Face­book post last Thurs­day that var­i­ous WP mem­bers will be help­ing out in Sengkang GRC on a ro­ta­tional ba­sis while Ms He and Ms Raeesah are on ma­ter­nity leave.</p>
    <p>He said the team, which in­cludes him­self, party chair Sylvia Lim and Ms He’s hus­band Ter­ence Tan, will stand in for Ms He and Ms Raeesah for their weekly Meet-the-Peo­ple Ses­sions, house vis­its and es­tate walks.</p>
    <p>In her post on Thurs­day, Ms He also thanked the health­care staff for work­ing over the fes­tive pe­riod</p>

    <p>and tak­ing care of her and her son. She added: “Here’s wish­ing ev­ery­one an amaz­ing, healthy and happy 2021!”</p>
    <p>Speaker of Par­lia­ment Tan</p>
    <p>Chuan-Jin also ex­tended his con­grat­u­la­tions to both MPs on their new babies.</p>
    <p>“Just as it has been rain­ing non­stop... show­ers of bless­ings on the fam­ily and loved ones,” he wrote. “What a great start to the year!”</p>
