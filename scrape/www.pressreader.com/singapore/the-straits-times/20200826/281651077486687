    <p>So­cial in­equal­ity has emerged as an area of con­cern in re­cent years, and the Gov­ern­ment has made clear its com­mit­ment to tackle in­equal­ity by broad­en­ing ed­u­ca­tional and train­ing path­ways, and im­prov­ing the co­or­di­na­tion and de­liv­ery of so­cial sup­port.</p>
    <p>But the painful im­pact of the Covid-19 cri­sis, which has been felt acutely by vulnerable groups, has un­der­scored the need to speed up some of these pol­icy ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>Plans laid out yes­ter­day by the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment (MSF) and Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE), for the new five-year term of gov­ern­ment, re­flect the na­tional re­sponse to emerg­ing ar­eas of need trig­gered by the cri­sis, while main­tain­ing con­ti­nu­ity in poli­cies geared at boost­ing so­cial mo­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Many low-wage work­ers have been hit harder than oth­ers by the cri­sis, as they tend to do in­se­cure gig work, or had their work hours cut back. They can ex­pect a help­ing hand from the MSF, which has promised to review and strengthen so­cial safety nets for the vulnerable.</p>
    <p>The as­sur­ance of some mea­sure of help is es­sen­tial in giv­ing this group a sense of sta­bil­ity that would spur them to up­grade their skills and find bet­ter job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the push to equip all sec­ondary school stu­dents ear­lier with elec­tronic de­vices will help level the play­ing field in ed­u­ca­tion as well.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial MOE tar­get has been brought for­ward by seven years. This means ev­ery sec­ondary school stu­dent will have his own lap­top or tablet by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>With MOE plan­ning to in­tro­duce a mix of on­line and class­room learn­ing in schools from next year, this move will en­sure all stu­dents are equally equipped to have a smoother ex­pe­ri­ence in tran­si­tion­ing to this new mode of learn­ing. It also helps safe­guard against stu­dents with fewer re­sources fall­ing be­hind their peers.</p>
    <p>Yet an­other pos­i­tive devel­op­ment is the ap­proach be­ing taken to develop a child in school. The MOE will pay greater at­ten­tion to tak­ing a more holis­tic ap­proach in nur­tur­ing stu­dents, with plans un­der way to fo­cus more on men­tal health and cy­ber-well­ness ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has led to a men­tal health fall­out, with this state of un­cer­tainty and flux ex­pected to drag on for the next few years.</p>
    <p>Con­se­quently, it is just as im­por­tant for stu­dents to have the emo­tional re­sources to cope with the cri­sis as it is for them to have</p>
