    <p>Even as Sin­ga­pore ad­justs its work pass poli­cies, it must be care­ful not to give the wrong im­pres­sion that the coun­try is clos­ing up and is no longer wel­com­ing for­eign­ers, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Such a rep­u­ta­tion would do us great harm and we have to watch this, be­cause we are be­ing watched,” he told Par­lia­ment, not­ing that pub­li­ca­tions like the Fi­nan­cial Times and South China Morn­ing Post had re­cently run ar­ti­cles about how the mood in Sin­ga­pore on for­eign­ers was chang­ing.</p>
    <p>“There are ar­ti­cles cir­cu­lat­ing on the In­ter­net – the grapevine buzzes,” PM Lee added. “We have to do the right thing for our­selves, but we must also avoid send­ing the wrong sig­nals to oth­ers.”</p>
    <p>Days af­ter the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced the min­i­mum salary to qual­ify for an Em­ploy­ment Pass would be raised from $3,900 to $4,500, mak­ing it more ex­pen­sive for firms to hire for­eign pro­fes­sion­als, the FT ran a re­port head­lined “Sin­ga­pore seeks to cut num­ber of ex­pa­tri­ates as re­ces­sion bites”.</p>
    <p>The re­port noted this had come at a time when fund man­agers and traders in Hong Kong were look­ing for a new base for their head­quar­ters in Asia, fol­low­ing the in­tro­duc­tion of a na­tional se­cu­rity law in the spe­cial ad­min­is­tra­tive re­gion of China.</p>
    <p>It also quoted a part­ner at a top in­ter­na­tional law firm as say­ing the move was about giv­ing the per­cep­tion that Sin­ga­pore is do­ing more to help lo­cals’ em­ploy­ment prospects. FT re­ported the part­ner as say­ing: “The flip side to that is it will prob­a­bly dam­age in­ter­na­tional per­cep­tion of Sin­ga­pore even if it doesn’t have a big im­pact.”</p>
