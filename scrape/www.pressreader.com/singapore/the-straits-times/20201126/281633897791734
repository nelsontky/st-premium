    <p>Amer­ica has “dodged the bul­let” of an au­thor­i­tar­ian pres­i­dent, said democ­racy scholar and au­thor Larry Di­a­mond, but Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den faces huge chal­lenges in ral­ly­ing most Amer­i­cans around him.</p>
    <p>Apart from con­trol­ling the Covid-19 pan­demic, the key test for Mr Bi­den will be to gen­er­ate suf­fi­cient, broadly dis­trib­uted and in­clu­sive eco­nomic growth, the Stan­ford Univer­sity pro­fes­sor of so­ci­ol­ogy and po­lit­i­cal science told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“It has to be a tide that re­ally lifts all boats,” he said, “so that there’s some­thing in it for ev­ery­body, so that peo­ple of colour see their prospects im­prov­ing. But also, so that the white work­ing class in so­called Rust Belt ar­eas of de­clin­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing see new hopes for mean­ing­fully re­mu­ner­a­tive work, bet­ter lives, bet­ter ed­u­ca­tional prospects and more dig­nity.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Dig­nity is a very im­por­tant word here. And a lot of peo­ple feel it’s been threat­ened or vi­o­lated.</p>
    <p>“If he can re­spond in a way that makes peo­ple feel like their lives are get­ting bet­ter, and we’re all in this to­gether, maybe he’ll be able to draw away some of the poi­son, some of the an­i­mus, the hos­til­ity, the racial hos­til­ity, out of the Trump phe­nom­e­non.”</p>
    <p>This week, Mr Trump – still main­tain­ing that the elec­tion was stolen from him af­ter a string of re­ver­sals in his le­gal chal­lenges seek­ing to over­turn the re­sults – al­lowed the transition to the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to com­mence.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts see that as a sign of the sur­vival of democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Dr Di­a­mond said: “I think we dodged some­thing of a bul­let with re­spect to the po­ten­tial for the first au­thor­i­tar­ian pres­i­dent in Amer­i­can his­tory – the pos­si­bil­ity that he might ac­tu­ally try to steal the elec­tion. And it’s clear that he’s go­ing to wind up hav­ing failed to do so.</p>
    <p>“But the fact that he tried, has tried, and is still try­ing is alarm­ing enough. I think that it’s grat­i­fy­ing and heart­en­ing that in the end, a crit­i­cal num­ber of of­fi­cials who are, them­selves, par­ti­san of­fi­cials like the Ge­or­gia sec­re­tary of state, sim­ply re­fused to go along with this.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s on­go­ing claims have cer­tainly dam­aged con­fi­dence in the elec­toral process, and he will prob­a­bly run for pres­i­dent again since he did not get the sec­ond term he sought this time, Dr Di­a­mond said. “He’ll be with us as a chal­lenge to Amer­i­can democ­racy, I think, for some time to come.”</p>
    <p>And what an­a­lysts are call­ing “Trump­ism” will also sur­vive.</p>
    <p>“Trump­ism is a pop­ulist re­ac­tion against so­cial and eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal change that peo­ple find threat­en­ing,” Dr Di­a­mond said. “That’s a very broad bas­ket that peo­ple can en­ter or find them­selves be­ing re­cruited into.”</p>
    <p>It in­cludes peo­ple who fear glob­al­i­sa­tion and job dis­place­ment, immigratio­n and so­cial di­ver­sity, and the com­plex­ity of more “non­white” peo­ple, he said. “And it in­cludes peo­ple who feel racial anx­i­ety in the Amer­i­can South, if not racism, and feel they’re go­ing to be dis­placed from their sta­tus.”</p>
    <p>He added: “It’s peo­ple who feel that they’re los­ing con­trol of their lives, their se­cu­rity, their na­tion’s se­cu­rity, and that there are all these un­con­trol­lable forces that are threat­en­ing them.</p>
    <p>“And so, when Trump comes along, or any pop­ulist dem­a­gogue comes along and says, ‘Amer­ica First’ and ‘Make Amer­ica Great Again’, what they hear is a reaf­fir­ma­tion of their in­se­cure sta­tus and an ef­fort to put things back to the way they were when they felt more se­cure in their sta­tus, wealth and power.”</p>
    <p>Trump­ism is a dem­a­gogic, an­gry, re­ac­tionary phe­nom­e­non “that isn’t re­ally solv­ing peo­ple’s prob­lems, and isn’t re­ally mak­ing any coun­try great again”, he said.</p>
    <p>“That isn’t to say that Trump hasn’t done some good and pos­i­tive things in terms of stand­ing up to China and try­ing to re­vive Amer­i­can man­u­fac­tur­ing, and worrying about the eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion of work­ing class peo­ple. I think these are very im­por­tant. But Trump­ism, as a phe­nom­e­non, is fun­da­men­tally a back­ward-look­ing thing.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, lin­ger­ing Trump­ism can­not trans­late into win­ning a ma­jor­ity of the na­tional pop­u­lar vote, which will be a chal­lenge for the Repub­li­can Party. “They’re not go­ing to win it with this kind of sub­ter­ranean racism,” Dr Di­a­mond said.</p>
    <p>“They’re go­ing to have to have a more racially in­clu­sive, op­ti­mist, Rea­ganesque type of a pro­file. They’re cer­tainly ca­pa­ble of that. If they do that, they’re go­ing to give the Demo­cratic Party a run for their money. But they’ve got to de­cide what kind of po­lit­i­cal party they’re go­ing to be.”</p>
