    <p>Tai­wanese singer Stella Chang has not been seen in pub­lic af­ter she shocked the Chi­nese entertainm­ent world when she an­nounced her di­vorce in June.</p>
    <p>Chang, 53, was pre­vi­ously mar­ried to banker Sung Hsueh-jen, 67. They had tied the knot in 2005 and have two sons aged 13 and 14.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Tai­wan’s Mir­ror Me­dia, she moved out of the fam­ily home early last month and stayed alone at an­other lux­ury house af­ter the an­nounce­ment.</p>
    <p>The singer ap­peared in pub­lic at last on Mon­day to cel­e­brate the birth­day of Tai­wanese vet­eran tele­vi­sion host Chang Hsiao-yen, who turned 72 on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Chang Hsiao-yen, who was the match­maker for Stella Chang and Mr Sung, is known as the “Big Sis­ter” of Tai­wan’s entertainm­ent in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In the pho­tos posted on Face­book by TV host Mickey Huang on Mon­day, Stella Chang was seen with short hair, in a grey blouse and blue shorts. She seemed to be in good spir­its and was also seen cut­ting the birth­day cakes with Chang Hsiao-yen.</p>
    <p>Huang, who mar­ried ac­tress Sum­mer Meng in March, cap­tioned the pho­tos: “Won­der­ful com­bi­na­tion cel­e­brat­ing the birth­day of Big Sis­ter Hsiao-yen. Thanks to Brother Isaac for the early de­ploy­ment.”</p>
    <p>He was re­fer­ring to top entertainm­ent agent Isaac Chen, who has man­aged di­vas such as Stella Chang, Sandy Lam and A-mei.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens also dubbed the birth­day cel­e­bra­tion a “gath­er­ing of Su­per Sun­day hosts”, as sev­eral hosts of the va­ri­ety pro­gramme, which ran from 1994 to 2003, were in at­ten­dance. They in­cluded Chang Hsiao-yen, Huang, Har­lem Yu and Pu Hsueh-liang.</p>
