    <p>2020 was the year that em­ploy­ers in Sin­ga­pore, like oth­ers world­wide, em­braced the con­cept of work­ing from home.</p>
    <p>For years, Sin­ga­pore had ex­plored this way of work­ing, es­pe­cially in the con­text of al­low­ing women to strike a bet­ter bal­ance be­tween their work and fam­ily re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But as re­cently as three years ago, re­mote work­ing re­mained an out­side op­tion. Only 6.2 per cent of firms al­lowed their em­ploy­ees to work from home per­ma­nently, noted for­mer Nee Soon GRC MP Lee Bee Wah in a 2017 par­lia­men­tary speech.</p>
    <p>“Many firms do not of­fer longterm flexi-work be­cause they are scared it will af­fect their pro­duc­tiv­ity or they do not trust their staff,” she said. “They are afraid ‘work­ing from home’ will turn into ‘shirk­ing from home’.”</p>
    <p>De­spite some in­cre­men­tal progress, this at­ti­tude re­mained largely con­stant un­til April 7, when the ma­jor­ity of work­ers and em­ploy­ers found that they no longer had any choice in the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The two-month cir­cuit breaker saw the clo­sure of schools, work­places, places of wor­ship and recre­ational fa­cil­i­ties in a bid to keep Covid-19 un­der control.</p>
    <p>This ma­jor shift – a com­plete de­par­ture from the mode of of­fice work­ing that most peo­ple are familiar with – was not with­out its teething prob­lems.</p>
    <p>While many em­ploy­ees cel­e­brated the end of their dreaded morn­ing com­mute, they also found that the bound­aries be­tween their work and per­sonal lives had blurred and de­te­ri­o­rated.</p>
    <p>Some may have wel­comed the cameo ap­pear­ances made by pets or chil­dren when phys­i­cal meet­ings went on­line, but oth­ers saw these as un­bear­able dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>And although they ac­knowl­edged that home was the safest place to be with a pan­demic go­ing on, many em­ploy­ees also missed the op­por­tu­nity to so­cialise with their col­leagues.</p>
    <p>In the grander scheme of things, the mass shift to work­ing from home has had a knock-on ef­fect on other in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>In May, Log­itech In­ter­na­tional</p>
    <p>While many em­ploy­ees cel­e­brated the end of their dreaded morn­ing com­mute, they also found that the bound­aries be­tween their work and per­sonal lives had blurred and de­te­ri­o­rated.</p>
    <p>Some may have wel­comed the cameo ap­pear­ances made by pets or chil­dren when phys­i­cal meet­ings went on­line, but oth­ers saw these as un­bear­able dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>re­ported a 13.6 per cent rise in sales for that quar­ter as peo­ple rushed to pur­chase we­b­cams, mi­cro­phones and other gad­gets to ease their tran­si­tion into re­mote work­ing.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts have pre­dicted that the de­mand for new of­fice space will re­main weak for some time, as re­mote work­ing con­tin­ues to be the de­fault and busi­nesses put the brakes on ex­pan­sion plans.</p>
    <p>Else­where, some have even sug­gested that smaller, de­cen­tralised “satel­lite of­fices” may be­come the norm.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, the Land Trans­port Author­ity noted that Covid-19 has changed com­mut­ing pat­terns and muted de­mand for taxis and pri­vate-hire cars – with driv­ers also tend­ing to earn lower fares from shorter trips – well into this month.</p>
    <p>But as a gen­eral rule, peo­ple have adapted to the new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey of 20,000 peo­ple in Au­gust found that over­all pro­duc­tiv­ity among em­ploy­ees grad­u­ally increased from April to June.</p>
    <p>In June, about 23 per cent of re­spon­dents said they were more pro­duc­tive when work­ing from home, as com­pared with 15 per cent in April.</p>
    <p>An­other sur­vey of 1,800 peo­ple, con­ducted in Oc­to­ber, found that eight in 10 re­spon­dents pre­ferred work­ing from home or hav­ing flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments. Just one in 10 said they hoped to re­turn to the of­fice full-time.</p>
    <p>As the pen­du­lum swings in the op­po­site di­rec­tion, with em­ploy­ers shift­ing back to­wards hy­brid work­ing ar­range­ments where em­ploy­ees spend at least half their time in the of­fice, it will come as no sur­prise if bosses face some push­back.</p>
    <p>But with Sin­ga­pore en­ter­ing phase three of its re­open­ing and kick­ing off its Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion ex­er­cise, it seems likely that many Sin­ga­pore­ans will be back in the of­fice by this time next year.</p>
