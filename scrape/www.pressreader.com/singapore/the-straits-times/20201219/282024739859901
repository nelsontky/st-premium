    <p>Mr Yoshi­hide Suga be­came Ja­pan’s 99th prime min­is­ter in Septem­ber when Mr Shinzo Abe bowed out be­cause of poor health. In many ways the two men could not be more dif­fer­ent. Mr Abe is a po­lit­i­cal blue blood while Mr Suga, the son of a straw­berry farmer, spent over four decades slog­ging his way up the po­lit­i­cal lad­der.</p>
    <p>There is an­other cru­cial dif­fer­ence – un­like Mr Abe, Mr Suga’s strengths and in­ter­est are not in the for­eign pol­icy or se­cu­rity do­main. His achieve­ments thus far have been in re­struc­tur­ing the tax sys­tem in favour of lo­cal au­thor­i­ties and low­er­ing tele­phone com­mu­ni­ca­tion fees. Hence most ob­servers here do not ex­pect Mr Suga to ex­er­cise strong lead­er­ship or launch ini­tia­tives in for­eign and se­cu­rity pol­icy mat­ters in the way Mr Abe did.</p>
    <p>That pref­er­ence to fo­cus on do­mes­tic mat­ters will be re­in­forced by cir­cum­stances in the new year. First, Mr Suga will have his hands full tack­ling Covid-19. Re­lated to that is the up­hill task of pulling off a suc­cess­ful sum­mer Olympics in Tokyo. Fi­nally, he will have to face a gen­eral elec­tion by Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>To be sure, na­tional lead­ers can­not in­su­late them­selves from chal­lenges and crises from abroad.</p>
    <p>So far, Mr Suga has been for­tu­nate. In terms of the US-Ja­pan re­la­tion­ship, he be­came prime min­is­ter at the right time for Ja­pan. Mr Abe, who had in­vested much in a per­sonal re­la­tion­ship with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, would have found the tran­si­tion to a new US leader some­what awk­ward. Mr Suga does not have that bag­gage.</p>
    <p>THE BI­DEN BLESS­ING</p>
    <p>Mr Joe Bi­den’s elec­tion vic­tory is a bless­ing for Ja­pan, not least be­cause of the re­turn to pre­dictabil­ity in bi­lat­eral ties. In the past four years, for all the Abe-Trump “bro­mance”, Ja­pan never ceased wor­ry­ing about what Mr Trump might do next to dam­age the re­la­tion­ship. Among other things, he had threat­ened to raise tar­iffs on im­ported cars and auto parts. He also de­manded that Ja­pan in­crease its fi­nan­cial con­tri­bu­tion to the US forces sta­tioned there four­fold – from US$1.8 bil­lion (S$2.4 bil­lion). That fig­ure is by far the high­est borne by host na­tions of Amer­i­can troops, but it cut no ice with Mr Trump, who once re­marked that if there was a third world war, the Ja­panese would be watch­ing it on Sony TV (de­spite the fact that there are not many Sony TVs out there any more) while the Amer­i­cans were do­ing the fight­ing.</p>
    <p>That sea­soned pro­fes­sion­als will take charge of US for­eign and se­cu­rity pol­icy un­der Mr Bi­den is also a plus for Mr Suga and Ja­pan. The US Pres­i­dent-elect has nom­i­nated Mr Antony Blinken as sec­re­tary of state and Mr Jake Sul­li­van as his na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser. Mr Blinken has worked in the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil, the Se­nate For­eign Re­la­tions Com­mit­tee and the State Depart­ment while Mr Sul­li­van was na­tional se­cu­rity ad­viser to Mr Bi­den when he was vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Bet­ter yet, Mr Blinken is known as a strong ad­vo­cate of al­liances. That change is al­ready vis­i­ble. In a re­cent tele­phone con­ver­sa­tion with Mr Suga, Mr Bi­den stated that the US would re­main com­mit­ted to the de­fence of the Senkaku is­lands, which China calls Diaoyu and claims as its own.</p>
    <p>That the state­ment came so soon was a relief to Ja­panese pol­i­cy­mak­ers and de­fence an­a­lysts. When Mr Barack Obama was first elected in 2009, he didn’t have many ex­pe­ri­enced Asia spe­cial­ists in his ad­min­is­tra­tion. As a re­sult, it took al­most six months for Ja­panese of­fi­cials to make their US coun­ter­parts fully ap­pre­ci­ate what the Senkaku is­lands is­sue was all about and why the US had a stake in its de­fence.</p>
    <p>THE CHINA BAL­ANC­ING ACT</p>
    <p>Chi­nese test­ing of Ja­panese pa­trols in the waters off the dis­puted is­lands will con­tinue to be a prob­lem for Ja­pan in the new year. But the big­ger con­cern is that the in­creas­ingly fre­quent and ag­gres­sive Chi­nese probes might go be­yond merely episodic to struc­tural, push­ing the en­ve­lope on how Bei­jing views and deals with Ja­pan’s ter­ri­to­rial claims.</p>
    <p>This worry is linked to do­mes­tic Chi­nese po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ments – that as Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s per­son­al­ity cult deep­ens, Chi­nese elites’ per­sonal suc­cess and se­cu­rity in­creas­ingly hinge on un­ques­tioned de­vo­tion to Mr Xi and his “China Dream” of na­tional re­ju­ve­na­tion. In such an en­vi­ron­ment, if you are part of the es­tab­lish­ment and make the mis­take of ex­press­ing doubts about Mr Xi’s rule and his dream, in­clud­ing that of be­com­ing the dom­i­nant mil­i­tary su­per­power, it could cost you your ca­reer and more.</p>
    <p>The risk of un­ques­tion­ing fealty is not just that Mr Xi will be ill-ad­vised for lack of di­verse views but also that it could com­pli­cate Bei­jing’s re­la­tions with other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, China in Novem­ber sent For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi to Ja­pan to im­prove ties. Un­for­tu­nately, at a press con­fer­ence, he ended up up­set­ting the Ja­panese pub­lic with his strong words as­sert­ing China’s sovereignt­y over the dis­puted is­lands and blam­ing Ja­panese fishing ves­sels for en­croach­ing into the sur­round­ing waters. China spe­cial­ists ex­plain that Mr Wang was talk­ing to his bosses in Bei­jing, not the Ja­panese au­di­ence, when he said what he said. But the dam­age was done.</p>
    <p>For Prime Min­is­ter Suga, deal­ing with China is a multi-fronted bal­anc­ing act. Clearly, China poses a de­fence challenge, not just in­volv­ing dis­puted ter­ri­tory but also in the cy­ber-se­cu­rity realm and be­yond. But the govern­ment also recog­nises that the Ja­panese busi­ness com­mu­nity is qui­etly hop­ing that the Sino-Ja­panese re­la­tion­ship will get bet­ter and that Mr Xi’s can­celled state visit to Ja­pan will be re­vived.</p>
    <p>AUS­TRALIA AND IN­DIA</p>
    <p>The Suga Cabi­net is not alone in fac­ing this ten­sion be­tween trade and se­cu­rity. Aus­tralia is in a worse fix, be­ing lately the tar­get of pun­ish­ing Chi­nese curbs on its key ex­ports. In Novem­ber, its Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son vis­ited Tokyo, the first for­eign leader to be re­ceived by Mr Suga in per­son. Both lead­ers reached an agree­ment in prin­ci­ple on bi­lat­eral “re­cip­ro­cal ac­cess agree­ment”, which would stream­line pro­ce­dures to fa­cil­i­tate de­ploy­ment and joint ac­tiv­i­ties of the two coun­tries’ armed forces in each other’s ter­ri­to­ries. That agree­ment, if signed, would make Aus­tralia Ja­pan’s quasi-ally.</p>
    <p>The stronger Aus­tralia-Ja­pan part­ner­ship has broader re­gional im­pli­ca­tions. As two of Amer­ica’s trusted al­lies in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion, Aus­tralia and Ja­pan can work to­gether to not only en­cour­age the US to re­main com­mit­ted to the peace and se­cu­rity of the re­gion but also help Amer­ica bet­ter man­age its com­pe­ti­tion with China.</p>
    <p>In­dia is also grow­ing in im­por­tance to Ja­pan as a strate­gic and eco­nomic part­ner.</p>
    <p>Early last month, In­dia, Ja­pan and the US took part in the Mal­abar joint naval ex­er­cise in the Bay of Ben­gal and the Ara­bian Sea. This year, the Aus­tralian navy took part as well, mak­ing the ex­er­cise a sym­bol of unity among the so-called Quad coun­tries and send­ing a strong mes­sage to China.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, not only Ja­pan but also the other Quad coun­tries un­der­stand the im­por­tance of their part­ner­ships with China. How­ever, they also un­der­stand that they will be able to en­gage with China much more ef­fec­tively if as Quad mem­bers they speak as one voice.</p>
    <p>NORTH KOREAN THREAT</p>
    <p>For Mr Suga, the out­look for the in­ter­na­tional en­vi­ron­ment in the com­ing year is gen­er­ally good, even if the same old prob­lems re­main: China and North Korea.</p>
    <p>On the down­side, North Korea may be­come even more volatile in the com­ing months. Its leader Kim Jong Un does not have any­thing to lose any more diplo­mat­i­cally now that his rec­on­cil­i­a­tion at­tempt with Mr Trump has failed. Mr Kim showed off brand-new in­ter­con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­siles in his coun­try’s first night­time mil­i­tary pa­rade in Oc­to­ber. ICBMs fly­ing in the skies over Ja­pan would not be such a good fan­fare for the Tokyo Olympic Games.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the mer­cu­rial Mr Kim might de­cide to talk to Mr Suga. Faced with sanc­tions and Covid-19 chal­lenges, North Korea is strug­gling. With un­usual candour, Mr Kim apol­o­gised for the dif­fi­cul­ties that his peo­ple were ex­pe­ri­enc­ing in his speech dur­ing the Oc­to­ber mil­i­tary pa­rade. If Mr Kim is to of­fer some new pro­pos­als on the vex­ing ab­duc­tion is­sue, that could at­tract Mr Suga’s at­ten­tion in an elec­tion year.</p>
    <p>For now, as the year draws to a close, Mr Suga’s pri­or­i­ties are largely do­mes­tic by cir­cum­stance and in­cli­na­tion. Ris­ing Covid-19 case num­bers and sink­ing pop­u­lar­ity rat­ings take prece­dence over al­most all other mat­ters. And yet who would have fore­seen, this time last year, that Mr Abe’s best-laid plans would have ended the way they did. Mr Suga may yet have to switch his fo­cus to mat­ters far­ther ashore.</p>
