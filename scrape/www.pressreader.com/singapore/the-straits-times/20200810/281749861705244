    <p>BEI­JING • China’s econ­omy has rid­den out its down­turn due to Covid-19 strains and bounced back to growth in the sec­ond quar­ter, as shown by mul­ti­ple mid-year in­di­ca­tors.</p>
    <p>Economists be­lieve that the coun­try’s V-shaped re­cov­ery is only get­ting started.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond quar­ter, China’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct ex­panded by 3.2 per cent year on year, re­vers­ing a 6.8 per cent con­trac­tion in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>China’s fis­cal rev­enue marked the first ex­pan­sion this year by gain­ing 3.2 per cent year on year in June.</p>
    <p>Such in­di­ca­tors and up­com­ing ones show that the coun­try first af­fected by the coro­n­avirus cri­sis will be the first ma­jor econ­omy to pull out of it.</p>
    <p>In­dus­trial pro­duc­tion growth is forecast to have picked up and re­tail sales may have stopped shrink­ing last month, in num­bers due this Friday. In­vest­ment for the first seven months of the year is ex­pected to con­tract com­pared with a year ear­lier, but at a slower pace than in the pre­vi­ous month.</p>
    <p>“China’s econ­omy has grad­u­ally emerged from the slump and re­turned to the level it was roughly at prior to the out­break, backed by the stim­u­la­tion that has de­liv­ered bur­geon­ing signs of work re­sump­tion, in­dus­trial chains and ser­vices sec­tor,” said Ori­ent Se­cu­ri­ties’ chief econ­o­mist Shao Yu.</p>
    <p>The Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex for China’s man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor rose from 50.9 in June to 51.1 last month, re­main­ing in ex­pan­sion ter­ri­tory for the fifth month in a row – an in­di­ca­tion of stronger con­fi­dence of mar­ket en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Steven Zhang, chief econ­o­mist at Morgan Stan­ley Huaxin Se­cu­ri­ties: “China has its in­sti­tu­tional ad­van­tages that en­able a more ag­ile and rapid re­sponse to public safety emer­gen­cies like Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>The prompt im­ple­men­ta­tion of mea­sures – in­clud­ing higher fis­cal spend­ing, tax re­lief, and cuts in lend­ing rates and banks’ re­serve re­quire­ments – to re­vive the econ­omy and sup­port em­ploy­ment is one ma­jor rea­son be­hind the sec­ond quar­ter’s growth, Mr Zhang added.</p>
    <p>As re­cent data showed that China’s i mports from emerg­ing coun­tries rose sig­nif­i­cantly, the re­cov­ery of the world’s sec­ond­largest econ­omy is ex­pected to boost the pace of other economies’ restora­tion, ac­cord­ing to Mr Zhang.</p>
    <p>In the first half of the year, China’s trade with Asean rose 5.6 per cent year on year to 2.09 tril­lion yuan (S$412 bil­lion), while that with coun­tries in the Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive ac­counted for 29.5 per cent of to­tal trade, up 0.7 per­cent­age point year on year.</p>
    <p>“China’s econ­omy has mostly rid­den out the Covid-19 blow and is en­ter­ing a V-shaped re­bound tra­jec­tory,” said Mr Zhang, fore­cast­ing the re­cov­ery to fur­ther con­sol­i­date in the third and fourth quar­ters with a 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent year-end growth.</p>

    <p>The prompt im­ple­men­ta­tion of mea­sures – in­clud­ing higher fis­cal spend­ing, tax re­lief, and cuts in lend­ing rates and banks’ re­serve re­quire­ments – to re­vive the econ­omy and sup­port em­ploy­ment is one ma­jor rea­son be­hind the sec­ond quar­ter’s growth, Morgan Stan­ley Huaxin Se­cu­ri­ties chief econ­o­mist Steven Zhang added.</p>
    <p>two pop­u­lar towns on the Flem­ish north­ern coast near the bor­der with the Nether­lands, said they took the step so as to “guar­an­tee public se­cu­rity”.</p>
    <p>Po­lice ar­rested sev­eral peo­ple on Satur­day on Blanken­berge beach af­ter a brawl broke out be­tween of­fi­cers and youth they had told to leave for re­fus­ing to re­spect safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The ring­leaders were barred from the re­sort which was also closed to day trip­pers, said Blanken­berge Mayor Daphne Dumery.</p>
    <p>“We need a quiet pe­riod... Any­one who comes to Blanken­berge must have a good rea­son to be here. With this step, we are try­ing to re­store calm,” she added.</p>
    <p>The nearby up­mar­ket re­sort of Knokke-Heist took a sim­i­lar step af­ter “dozens of in­ci­dents, dur­ing the day and the night”, a city coun­cil state­ment said.</p>
