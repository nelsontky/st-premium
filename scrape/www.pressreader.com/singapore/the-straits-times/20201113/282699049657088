    <p>English ac­tor Hugh Grant re­vealed that he con­tracted Covid-19 ear­lier in the year, join­ing the list of celebri­ties who have been in­fected by the virus .</p>
    <p>In an ap­pear­ance on The Late Show With Stephen Col­bert ear­lier this week, Grant, 60, let on that he caught the coro­n­avirus in Fe­bru­ary this year.</p>
    <p>“It started as just a very strange syn­drome where I kept break­ing into a ter­ri­ble sweat. It was like a pon­cho of sweat, em­bar­rass­ing re­ally,” said the Four Wed­dings And A Fu­neral (1994) and Not­ting Hill (1999) ac­tor.</p>
    <p>“Then my eye­balls felt about three sizes too big and this feel­ing as though some enor­mous man was sit­ting on my chest, sort of Har­vey We­in­stein or some­one,” Grant con­tin­ued, re­fer­ring to the dis­graced movie mogul.</p>
    <p>He added: “I thought, ‘ I don’t know what this is,’ and then I was walk­ing down the street one day and I thought ‘I can’t smell a damn thing’ and start to panic.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to re­searchers, the loss of the sense of smell is one of the symp­toms of a Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Grant, who is cur­rently star­ring in HBO’s mys­tery thriller The Un­do­ing with ac­tress Ni­cole Kid­man, said: “I started sniff­ing in garbage cans. You know, you want to sniff strangers’ armpits be­cause you just can’t smell any­thing,” he said.</p>
    <p>He went home and sprayed his wife’s per­fume di­rectly into his face. “Couldn’t smell a thing, but I did go blind,” he joked, adding that his wife, Swedish TV pro­ducer Anna Eber­stein, also con­tracted the coro­n­avirus in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Both of them have re­cov­ered. Other celebri­ties who have con­tracted the coro­n­avirus in­clude ac­tor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wil­son, Bri­tish ac­tor Idris Elba, wrestler-turned-ac­tor Dwayne “The Rock” John­son, Twi­light (2008 to 2012) star Robert Pat­tin­son and Brave­heart (1995) ac­tor Mel Gibson.</p>
