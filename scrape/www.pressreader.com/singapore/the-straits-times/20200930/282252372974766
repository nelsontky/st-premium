    <p>• It has been pretty much boom or bust for Je­lena Ostapenko at Roland Gar­ros but she be­lieves she can re­turn to the world’s top 10 with a lit­tle more con­sis­tency in her game, after she se­cured her first French Open vic­tory yesterday since lift­ing the tro­phy in 2017.</p>
    <p>The Lat­vian, 23, blasted 46 win­ners en route to a 6-2, 6-1 de­feat of Madi­son Bren­gle – her only win at Roland Gar­ros since her shock run to the ti­tle three years ago.</p>
    <p>Ostapenko’s raw ta­lent and fear­less ap­proach pow­ered her to a stun­ning French Open tri­umph that saw her be­come the first un­seeded player to win the Suzanne Len­glen Cup since Bri­tain’s Mar­garet Scriven in 1933.</p>
    <p>But she ad­mit­ted she strug­gled to cope with in­creased ex­pec­ta­tions fol­low­ing that fairy-tale run in Paris, and has added just two mi­nor ti­tles to her col­lec­tion since beat­ing Si­mona Halep in the 2017 fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“After I won it was a tough time. I had to get used to the pres­sure but now it’s all gone, and fi­nally I won my first match after two years (of los­ing),” she said yesterday. “I feel like much bet­ter than the years be­fore. I was prac­tis­ing a lot. I didn’t play the US swing and I was prac­tis­ing all the time on clay. I was kind of wait­ing for this clay sea­son. Fi­nally, here we are. Yeah, just tak­ing one match at a time, but really happy with my per­for­mance to­day.”</p>
    <p>She hit 40 more win­ners than Bren­gle, while also com­mit­ting 22 un­forced errors more than her 78th-ranked op­po­nent.</p>
    <p>Ostapenko reached a ca­reer-high rank­ing of No. 5 in March 2018 and made both the quar­ter-fi­nals and semi-fi­nals at Wim­ble­don in the two ap­pear­ances di­rectly after her French Open break­through.</p>
    <p>But she en­tered this year’s con­clud­ing Grand Slam again un­seeded, at No. 43 in the world.</p>
    <p>“I just have to be more con­fi­dent in my game and more con­sis­tent,” said Ostapenko, who could pose a test for fourth-ranked Karolina Pliskova – who beat Egyp­tian qual­i­fier Ma­yar Sherif 6-7 (9-11), 6-2, 6-4 – in the se­cond round.</p>
    <p>“If there is a con­sis­tency in my game, I think I’m go­ing to be a very danger­ous player and it’s go­ing to be very, like, not easy to beat me... If I get my con­sis­tency back like in 2017 and begin­ning of 2018 also, I think I’ll be back in like top 10.”</p>
    <p>Con­sis­tency is some­thing world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic is all too fa­mil­iar with. The Serb notched his 32nd win in 33 matches this year by beat­ing Swe­den’s Mikael Ymer 6-0, 6-2, 6-3.</p>
    <p>While Ostapenko and Djokovic cruised, it was not the same for oth­ers in Paris. On Mon­day, Ital­ian qual­i­fier Lorenzo Giustino fi­nally out­lasted France’s Corentin Moutet 0-6, 7-6 (9-7), 7-6 (7-3), 2-6, 18-16 in the se­cond long­est match in French Open history at 6hr 5min.</p>
    <p>The clash fea­tured 459 points won, 145 win­ners and 184 un­forced errors.</p>
    <p>World No. 157 Giustino se­cured his first Grand Slam main draw and Tour-level win after a fi­nal set last­ing 180 min­utes in a match held over from Sunday.</p>
    <p>Moutet won more points than Giustino – 242 to 217 – but the 29-year-old jour­ney­man emerged the vic­tor in a con­test that fell 28 min­utes short of the tour­na­ment’s record marathon tie be­tween Fabrice San­toro and Ar­naud Cle­ment in 2004.</p>
    <p>Also on Mon­day, Rafael Nadal started his quest for a record-ex­tend­ing 13th French Open ti­tle with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 first-round win against Be­laru­sian Egor Gerasi­mov. The Spa­niard, look­ing to equal Roger Fed­erer’s record of 20 Grand Slam men’s sin­gles ti­tles, will face Amer­i­can Macken­zie Mc­Don­ald to­day.</p>
