    <p>Cou­ples who are seek­ing un­con­tested di­vorces and are not rep­re­sented by lawyers will soon be able to ob­tain such di­vorces online, with­out need­ing to at­tend court hear­ings or for­mally sub­mit court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>An online por­tal, called Lit­i­ga­tion As­sist, will be launched to help such lit­i­gants-in-per­son with the gen­er­a­tion and sub­mis­sion of doc­u­ments and draft court or­ders, said</p>
    <p>Chief Jus­tice Sundaresh Menon yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Where ap­pro­pri­ate, it will also con­nect them with lawyer-me­di­a­tors who can ad­vise and as­sist them with online ne­go­ti­a­tions,” the Chief Jus­tice added in his online open­ing speech for the an­nual Law So­ci­ety Fam­ily Con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The two-day con­fer­ence com­prises eight we­bi­nars by pan­el­lists, in­clud­ing lawyers and judges, on top­ics about the prac­tice of fam­ily law.</p>
    <p>The Chief Jus­tice said that Lit­i­ga­tion As­sist would help en­hance ac­cess to the fam­ily jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>This is in line with the fam­ily jus­tice sys­tem’s adop­tion of “ther­a­peu­tic jus­tice” as its over­ar­ch­ing phi­los­o­phy – where the law helps di­vorc­ing par­ties to re­pair their re­la­tion­ships to a func­tional level and to focus on their shared fu­ture, among other things, said the Chief Jus­tice.</p>
    <p>The adop­tion of ther­a­peu­tic jus­tice will in­volve the re­struc­tur­ing of ex­ist­ing court pro­cesses, es­pe­cially in the pro­vi­sion of more “up­stream” ser­vices such as coun­selling and me­di­a­tion for fam­i­lies be­fore they ap­ply to the court for divorce.</p>
    <p>The per­spec­tive on the role of fam­ily law by key stake­hold­ers must also be changed fun­da­men­tally, said the Chief Jus­tice.</p>
    <p>An ex­am­ple he of­fered was for the di­vorc­ing par­ties to be re­ferred to in court judg­ments as “hus­band” and“wife ”, or“father” and “mother”, in­stead of “plain­tiff” and “de­fen­dant”. This is to re­flect the re­la­tion­ships they share and the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties that they will con­tinue to owe to each other and to their chil­dren, he said.</p>
    <p>The Chief Jus­tice also said that a cur­ricu­lum for fam­ily court judges will be de­vel­oped to fa­mil­iarise them with the tools avail­able un­der the new ap­proach of ther­a­peu­tic jus­tice.</p>
    <p>“Sim­i­larly, our prac­ti­tion­ers must be of­fered train­ing so that they may ad­vise their clients on the most suitable course for the res­o­lu­tion of fa­mil­ial con­flict, and to em­power them to ex­er­cise the ap­pro­pri­ate skills re­quired in each sit­u­a­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Chief Jus­tice said that the courts will also con­tinue to work with other stake­hold­ers in the fam­ily jus­tice sys­tem, such as the so­cial ser­vices, men­tal health and law en­force­ment sec­tors, to re­solve fam­ily dis­putes.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, a new scheme un­der con­sid­er­a­tion for deal­ing with al­leged child abuse cases may see the Fam­ily Jus­tice Courts, the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment and the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force share in­for­ma­tion and for­mu­late a triage pro­to­col, he said.</p>
    <p>“The goal is to help us act more quickly and ac­cu­rately to sift out al­le­ga­tions of child abuse that have merit, from those that are be­ing weaponised to harm the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the other par­ent and their child.”</p>
    <p>The Chief Jus­tice also said that the Covid-19 pan­demic has ex­posed “in­her­ent fault lines in fam­i­lies” and sub­jected the fam­ily jus­tice sys­tem to a sig­nif­i­cant stress test, not­ing a ris­ing trend in fam­ily vi­o­lence across the world, among other things.</p>
    <p>“As the end of the pan­demic re­mains out of sight, we will have to keep our sights on both the im­por­tant task of recon­cep­tu­al­is­ing fam­ily jus­tice, and the ur­gent need to en­sure the smooth de­liv­ery of fam­ily jus­tice in spite of the present chal­lenges,” he added.</p>
    <p>UR­GENT NEED</p>
    <p>As the end of the pan­demic re­mains out of sight, we will have to keep our sights on both the im­por­tant task of recon­cep­tu­al­is­ing fam­ily jus­tice, and the ur­gent need to en­sure the smooth de­liv­ery of fam­ily jus­tice in spite of the present chal­lenges.</p>
