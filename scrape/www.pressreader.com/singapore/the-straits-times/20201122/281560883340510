    <p>RIYADH • The Group of 20 na­tions must help plug a US$4.5 bil­lion (S$6 bil­lion) fund­ing gap for a WHOled pro­gramme to dis­trib­ute coron­avirus vac­cines and pave the way for an end to the pan­demic, a let­ter seen by Agence France-Presse (AFP) said.</p>
    <p>The let­ter, sent ahead of this week­end’s vir­tual G-20 summit, was signed by Nor­we­gian Prime Min­is­ter Erna Sol­berg, South African Pres­i­dent Cyril Ramaphosa, World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) chief Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus and Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen.</p>
    <p>“A com­mit­ment by G-20 lead­ers at the G-20 summit in Riyadh to in­vest sub­stan­tially in the ACT-Ac­cel­er­a­tor’s im­me­di­ate fund­ing gap of US$4.5 bil­lion will im­me­di­ately save lives, lay the ground­work for mass pro­cure­ment and de­liv­ery of Covid-19 tools around the world, and pro­vide an exit strat­egy out of this global eco­nomic and hu­man cri­sis,” the let­ter dated Nov 16 and seen by AFP on Fri­day said.</p>
    <p>“With this fund­ing, and a joint com­mit­ment to spend a pro­por­tion of fu­ture stim­u­lus on the Covid-19 tools needed glob­ally, the G-20 will build a foun­da­tion to end the pan­demic,” added the let­ter ad­dressed to King Sal­man bin Ab­du­laziz Al Saud of Saudi Ara­bia, the cur­rent G-20 pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>ACT-Ac­cel­er­a­tor is an ini­tia­tive led by the WHO that pro­motes eq­ui­table dis­tri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines, di­ag­nos­tics and treat­ments glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies are now clos­ing in on vac­cines against the virus, amid a global spike in cases that has caused some coun­tries to reim­pose re­stric­tions to curb trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“The re­cent break­throughs on Covid-19 vac­cines of­fer a ray of hope” but they must “reach ev­ery­one”, United Na­tions chief An­to­nio Guter­res said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“Over the past seven months, coun­tries have in­vested US$10 bil­lion in the ef­fort to develop vac­cines, di­ag­nos­tics and ther­a­peu­tics. But US$28 bil­lion more is needed – in­clud­ing US$4.2 bil­lion be­fore the end of the year,” he added.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the UN es­ti­mated that the ACT-Ac­cel­er­a­tor had re­ceived only US$3 bil­lion of the US$38 bil­lion needed to meet the goal of pro­duc­ing and de­liv­er­ing two bil­lion vac­cine doses, 245 mil­lion treat­ments and 500 mil­lion di­ag­nos­tic tests over the next year.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional Mon­e­tary Fund (IMF) man­ag­ing direc­tor Kristalina Ge­orgieva warned on Thurs­day that the global econ­omy faces a hard road back from the Covid-19 down­turn even as a med­i­cal so­lu­tion is in sight.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has in­fected more than 58 mil­lion peo­ple and caused more than 1.3 mil­lion deaths world­wide. The IMF ex­pects the world econ­omy to con­tract by 4.4 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>“The lack of an ad­e­quately fi­nanced global exit strat­egy is an ex­is­ten­tial threat to the eco­nomic and health se­cu­rity of all coun­tries and their cit­i­zens,” said the let­ter to the G-20 pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“Only by tack­ling the pan­demic glob­ally will eco­nomic vi­tal­ity be re­stored and a catas­tro­phe be averted.”</p>
