    <p>SYD­NEY • Aus­tralia recorded its dead­li­est day of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic yes­ter­day with 14 deaths and more than 700 new in­fec­tions, mainly in Vic­to­ria state.</p>
    <p>The toll takes the coun­try’s to­tal num­ber of fa­tal­i­ties from the coro­n­avirus to 190, more than half of which have oc­curred in Vic­to­ria, the sec­ond-most pop­u­lous state, and its cap­i­tal Mel­bourne, Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia had prided it­self on rapidly con­tain­ing the ini­tial Covid-19 out­break but a sec­ond wave which be­gan in Vic­to­ria last month has forced Mel­bourne back into lock­down and sparked out­breaks in other ar­eas, in­clud­ing Syd­ney.</p>
    <p>“We’ve now been in this lock­down (in Mel­bourne) for some weeks and we are not get­ting the re­sults we would hope for, and as a re­sult the fur­ther mea­sures that are taken are cer­tainly nec­es­sary,” Mr Mor­ri­son said.</p>
    <p>“On some days the virus wins, on other days we beat it. But I think we’ve got to be care­ful not to slip into some idea that there’s some golden im­mu­nity that Aus­tralia has in re­la­tion to this virus.”</p>
    <p>Fur­ther re­stric­tions on move­ment would dam­age the econ­omy, which is al­ready in its first re­ces­sion in 30 years, but fail­ure to con­trol the lat­est out­breaks would do more eco­nomic harm in the long run, Mr Mor­ri­son added.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria Premier Daniel An­drews said every­one in the state of more than six mil­lion peo­ple must wear a mask when out­side from Sun­day, widen­ing a re­quire­ment al­ready in place in Mel­bourne. He also ex­tended so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions, with res­i­dents in com­mu­ni­ties south-west of Mel­bourne no longer al­lowed to have vis­i­tors to their homes from late yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cafes, pubs and restau­rants would be al­lowed to stay open, how­ever, be­cause these were con­trolled en­vi­ron­ments where so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules could be en­forced.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing friends over to your house is not a con­trolled en­vi­ron­ment,” Mr An­drews said.</p>
