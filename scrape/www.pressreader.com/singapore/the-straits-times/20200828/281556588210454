    <p>Repub­li­cans at this week’s Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion have used a new line of at­tack on Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den: the no­tion that China prefers Mr Bi­den to win the United States pres­i­den­tial election in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>By Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s el­dest son’s retelling, Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den would be the best thing to ever hap­pen to China.</p>
    <p>“Bei­jing Bi­den is so weak on China that the in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity re­cently as­sessed that the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party favours Bi­den,” said Mr Don­ald Trump Jr on Mon­day, the first night of the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion (RNC). “They know he’ll weaken us both eco­nom­i­cally and on a world stage.”</p>
    <p>The no­tion that China prefers Mr Bi­den to win in Novem­ber has be­come the lat­est Repub­li­can line of at­tack against the Democrats, and has been men­tioned sev­eral times over the course of the RNC. It has its roots in a re­cent as­sess­ment by US Na­tional Counter-in­tel­li­gence and Se­cu­rity Cen­tre direc­tor Wil­liam Evan­ina, who said on Aug 7 that China prefers that Mr Trump – whom Bei­jing sees as un­pre­dictable – does not win re-election.</p>
    <p>Mr Evan­ina made no men­tion of whether China viewed a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion as more ben­e­fi­cial for its in­ter­ests, but this did not stop the Pres­i­dent him­self from tweet­ing on Wed­nes­day: “Just In: Chi­nese State Me­dia and Lead­ers of CHINA want Bi­den to win the US Election.”</p>
    <p>He added: “If this hap­pened (which it won’t), China would own our Coun­try, and our Record Set­ting Stock Mar­kets would lit­er­ally CRASH!”</p>
    <p>Be­ing tough on China is not an un­com­mon strat­egy in US elec­tions. But this election takes place amid par­tic­u­larly strained re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries and at a time when the Amer­i­can pub­lic’s opinion of China is at a his­toric low, ac­cord­ing to a Pew Re­search Cen­tre poll last month.</p>
    <p>Through­out the RNC, Mr Trump’s al­lies have used China as a punch­ing bag, par­tially to bol­ster the Pres­i­dent’s achieve­ments in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Some blamed China squarely for un­leash­ing the coro­n­avirus on the world, and praised Mr Trump for clos­ing US bor­ders to trav­ellers from China, elid­ing the fact that 180,000 Amer­i­cans died of Covid-19 af­ter that.</p>
    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence, in a speech that closed the third night of the RNC, lauded Mr Trump’s re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus – an elec­toral vul­ner­a­bil­ity that has cost him in ap­proval rat­ings.</p>
    <p>The United States now leads the world in coro­n­avirus cases and deaths, but the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has sought to shift the fo­cus from its han­dling of the pan­demic to the virus’ ori­gin, China.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Pence: “Be­fore the first case of the coro­n­avirus spread within the US, the Pres­i­dent took un­prece­dented ac­tion and sus­pended all travel from China, the sec­ond-largest econ­omy in the world. That ac­tion saved un­told Amer­i­can lives.”</p>
    <p>Oth­ers ac­cused China of rob­bing Amer­i­cans of jobs, then cred­ited Mr Trump with bring­ing th­ese jobs back to Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­lar­ity of Repub­li­can men­tions of China stood in con­trast to the Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion (DNC) a week be­fore. China was barely men­tioned then, even in Mr Bi­den’s ac­cep­tance speech – prompt­ing the Trump cam­paign to ac­cuse the DNC of hav­ing “com­pletely ig­nored the economic and na­tional se­cu­rity threats posed by China” in a state­ment on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the Repub­li­can Party also gave a plat­form to Chi­nese civil rights ac­tivist and lawyer Chen Guangcheng, a prom­i­nent critic of China’s one-child pol­icy who left China for the US in 2012 af­ter seek­ing Amer­i­can diplo­matic pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Chen, who slammed the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party as “an en­emy of hu­man­ity”, en­dorsed Mr Trump as a cham­pion who would stand up to China.</p>
    <p>“The US must use its val­ues of free­dom, democ­racy, and the rule of law, to gather a coali­tion of other democ­ra­cies to stop China’s ag­gres­sion. Pres­i­dent Trump has led on this and we need the other coun­tries to join him in this fight,” he said.</p>
    <p>It was a chance for Repub­li­cans and Democrats to duel over their can­di­date’s hu­man rights record. On its web­site, the Trump cam­paign called Mr Bi­den’s record on hu­man rights in China “ap­palling” and ac­cused his son Hunter of prof­it­ing from his fa­ther’s close ties with China.</p>
    <p>But Democrats and even friends of Mr Chen, in­clud­ing his lawyer in China, Mr Teng Biao, said Mr Trump’s own state­ments un­der­cut his por­trayal as a cham­pion of hu­man rights.</p>
    <p>Be­ing tough on China is not an un­com­mon strat­egy in US elec­tions. But this election takes place amid par­tic­u­larly strained re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries and at a time when the Amer­i­can pub­lic’s at­ti­tudes to­wards China are at a his­toric low, ac­cord­ing to a Pew Re­search Cen­tre poll last month. Through­out the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion, Mr Trump’s al­lies have used China as a punch­ing bag, par­tially to bol­ster the Pres­i­dent’s achieve­ments in of­fice.</p>
