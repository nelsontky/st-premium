    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia’s High Court yes­ter­day is­sued a stern warn­ing to Na­jib Razak over his Face­book post on for­mer Bank Ne­gara gov­er­nor Zeti Akhtar Aziz, an up­com­ing wit­ness in his graft trial.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Collin Lawrence Se­querah said the for­mer premier must not make state­ments re­lat­ing to the trial “as if the trial is in the public do­main”.</p>
    <p>The court had ear­lier heard sub­mis­sions from both par­ties aris­ing from the pros­e­cu­tion’s ap­pli­ca­tion for Na­jib to be is­sued a warn­ing on the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“The state­ments that Zeti had made (in in­ter­views) do not jus­tify the ac­cused in this case re­spond­ing by way of his Face­book post. What the ac­cused stated in his post can be viewed, as a whole, as an at­tack to the wit­ness.</p>
    <p>“The court there­fore is­sues a stern warn­ing not to re­peat the ac­tion,” said Jus­tice Se­querah.</p>
    <p>He added that the court would take any ac­tion nec­es­sary to pro­tect its in­tegrity.</p>
    <p>Na­jib faces 25 abuse of power and money laun­der­ing charges over RM2.28 bil­lion (S$750 mil­lion) of 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) funds that had been de­posited in his AmBank ac­counts between Fe­bru­ary 2011 and De­cem­ber 2014.</p>
    <p>In his Face­book post on Dec 29, Na­jib asked Tan Sri Zeti to re­spond to claims that her fam­ily had re­ceived over RM100 mil­lion said to be from 1MDB funds from fugi­tive busi­ness­man Low Taek Jho.</p>
    <p>Dr Zeti re­sponded in a state­ment on Dec 31: “I wish to re­it­er­ate that my fam­ily and I have never re­ceived any sums of money from 1MDB. The al­le­ga­tions against me and my fam­ily are com­pletely false and ma­li­cious.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day in the High Court, Na­jib’s lead coun­sel, Tan Sri Muham­mad Shafee Ab­dul­lah, sub­mit­ted that Na­jib’s Face­book post was in re­sponse to state­ments Dr Zeti made in two ar­ti­cles that were pub­lished on­line.</p>
    <p>“She con­tin­ued to at­tack my client” in July 2018, Mr Shafee said, a day be­fore Na­jib was charged in court in re­la­tion to SRC In­ter­na­tional, a for­mer unit of scan­dal-tainted state fund 1MDB.</p>
    <p>The lawyer said the court needed to be con­scious of a cit­i­zen’s right to free­dom of speech un­der Ar­ti­cle 10 of the fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion and whether the so­cial me­dia post was con­tempt of court.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Ah­mad Akram Gharib said one of the two ar­ti­cles which car­ried Dr Zeti’s state­ments was from eu­romoney.com.</p>
    <p>“It was an in­ter­view on the is­sue of econ­omy. Noth­ing in this whole ar­ti­cle amounts to a per­sonal at­tack on Na­jib,” he said.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond ar­ti­cle, from The Edge news­pa­per, was Dr Zeti’s re­sponse to a claim Na­jib made in a re­cent in­ter­view. “She was re­spond­ing to a state­ment made about her. She was not even listed as a wit­ness at this point.”</p>
