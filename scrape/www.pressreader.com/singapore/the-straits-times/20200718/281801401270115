    <p>• Hong Kong’s new coro­n­avirus out­break is prov­ing more ag­gres­sive than its pre­vi­ous waves of in­fec­tion, in a cau­tion­ary tale that the worst may be yet to come in the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties re­ported 50 lo­cal virus cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing to­tal in­fec­tions in the lat­est wave to over 350. The for­mer Bri­tish colony is now one of the first places in the re­gion to see a new wave dwarf­ing pre­vi­ous ones.</p>
    <p>The resur­gence in the Asian fi­nan­cial hub has moved at an ag­gres­sive pace since erupt­ing less than two weeks ago af­ter a l ong stretch dur­ing which res­i­dents re­turned to work and nor­mal life.</p>
    <p>About a third of in­fec­tions in the new out­break are of un­known ori­gins, sig­nalling that hid­den chains of trans­mis­sion are wide­spread.</p>
    <p>“Coun­tries which con­trolled the dis­ease well in the early part of the year will re­main at risk of out­breaks and even sus­tained com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion, un­til we have a vac­cine,” said global biose­cu­rity pro­fes­sor Raina Mac­In­tyre from the Univer­sity of New South Wales in Syd­ney. “Whether or not the virus has mu­tated is spec­u­la­tion at this stage, but there is some ev­i­dence the dom­i­nant strain in the world is more trans­mis­si­ble than the ini­tial strain in Wuhan.”</p>
    <p>But the size of the new wave in Hong Kong may re­flect more test­ing and ear­lier de­tec­tion of cases, and of­fi­cials are hope­ful of min­imis­ing eco­nomic and so­cial suf­fer­ing with bet­ter man­age­ment strate­gies.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors now know bet­ter how to treat Covid-19, lim­it­ing the num­ber of cases that de­te­ri­o­rate to in­ten­sive care or death. The health­care sys­tems in cities grap­pling with new out­breaks are also not be­ing over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>Still, with­out an ef­fec­tive and widely dis­trib­uted vac­cine, cities are likely to con­tinue in a state of limbo, where eas­ing of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures will lead to a spike in in­fec­tions. The virus’ abil­ity to spread silently for weeks is still not fully un­der­stood by sci­en­tists, some of whom sus­pect that it can linger in the air for hours.</p>
    <p>In main­land China, the prov­ince of Guang­dong, which neigh­bours Hong Kong, tight­ened its en­try re­quire­ments yes­ter­day in re­sponse to the fi­nan­cial hub’s new wave of in­fec­tions, the South China Morn­ing Post re­ported.</p>
    <p>Start­ing yes­ter­day, Hong Kongers must prove that they have tested neg­a­tive for the coro­n­avirus in or­der to be granted ap­proval to cross the bor­der into Guang­dong.</p>
    <p>The Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties said late on Thurs­day that those en­ter­ing Guang­dong via Shen­zhen Bay Port or Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Ma­cau Bridge must present a cer­tifi­cate show­ing a valid neg­a­tive nu­cleic acid test re­sult for Covid-19. The doc­u­ment has to be is­sued by one of the city’s test­ing in­sti­tu­tions recog­nised by the gov­ern­ment, and the test re­sult will be valid for only 72 hours from the time the sam­ples are col­lected.</p>
    <p>Those al­lowed to cross the bor­der will still have to un­dergo 14 days of manda­tory quar­an­tine, ac­cord­ing to a no­tice is­sued by the au­thor­i­ties in the Guang­dong city of Zhuhai.</p>
    <p>ON­GO­ING RISK</p>
    <p>Coun­tries which con­trolled the dis­ease well in the early part of the year will re­main at risk of out­breaks and even sus­tained com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion, ’’ un­til we have a vac­cine.</p>
