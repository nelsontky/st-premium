    <p>Sin­ga­pore has fallen two places over the past 12 months to be the 14th most ex­pen­sive city in the world for ex­pa­tri­ates and it is now the sev­enth prici­est in Asia, ac­cord­ing to a new sur­vey.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore has been over­taken by the Ja­panese cities Yoko­hama at 10th, Osaka at 12th and Nagoya at 13th, liv­ing costs have re­mained largely steady and it re­mains a costly lo­ca­tion due to the strong Sin­ga­pore dol­lar.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong dropped out of the top five to sixth place in the sur­vey com­piled by ECA In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Quane, its di­rec­tor for Asia, noted that there was only a “small drop in the global rank­ings amid the un­cer­tainty” de­spite Hong Kong’s po­lit­i­cal and so­cial un­rest last year and the “im­pact of Covid-19, which has led to the re­luc­tance of peo­ple mov­ing to the city”.</p>
    <p>The world’s most costly city is Ash­ga­bat in Turk­menistan, which also topped last year’s league ta­ble com­piled by ECA In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>The bian­nual sur­vey as­sesses liv­ing costs in cities for non-lo­cal em­ploy­ees based on a bas­ket of goods and ser­vices such as gro­ceries, cloth­ing and leisure ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Take a cup of cof­fee in a cafe: It is about US$4.44 (S$6.16) here com­pared with US$5.01 in Hong Kong and US$2.87 in Hanoi.</p>
    <p>House rents, cars and school fees are not in­cluded in the cal­cu­la­tions as they are usu­ally paid for by em­ploy­ers and so are un­re­lated to an ex­pat’s spend­ing power.</p>
    <p>China’s two pow­er­houses both dropped nine places in the new rank­ings with Shang­hai at 19th and Bei­jing at 24.</p>
    <p>Mr Quane said: “Chi­nese cities have all fallen... due to signs of a weak­en­ing econ­omy and poorly per­form­ing cur­rency. One of the key con­tribut­ing fac­tors was un­doubt­edly the out­break of Covid-19. How­ever, it is im­por­tant to note that the ren­minbi was per</p>
    <p>Ma­cau Seoul Shang­hai form­ing poorly be­fore this pe­riod too, with the out­break of the coro­n­avirus ex­ac­er­bat­ing the rel­a­tive weak­ness of the Chi­nese cur­rency against other ma­jor cur­ren­cies.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the cost of liv­ing in South Korea has fallen due to the pan­demic, with Seoul drop­ping from 8th place to 17th, while Bu­san slipped out of the top 20 en­tirely.</p>
    <p>Mr Quane noted: “A quick lock­down, cou­pled with the high rates of in­fec­tion that Korean cities saw to­wards the end of Fe­bru­ary, meant that con­fi­dence in the South Korean won had fal­tered. This in turns makes the cost of liv­ing cheaper for ex­pa­tri­ates.”</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Thai and Viet­namese cities have once again moved up the rank­ings, with Bangkok ris­ing 64 places in five years and Hanoi up 25 over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mr Quane at­trib­uted Thai­land’s steady rise to eco­nomic growth and the at­trac­tion of for­eign in­vest­ment which helped to boost the baht.</p>
