    <p>Bought some green­ery to spruce up your home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker? You are in good com­pany.</p>
    <p>Ms Pa­tri­cia Law, founder of so­cial me­dia agency Good­stuph, bought more than 50 plants dur­ing Sin­ga­pore’s two-month shut­down of non-es­sen­tial ser­vices and work­places.</p>
    <p>Ms Law, who is in her late 30s, started col­lect­ing plants last year when she bought some for her of­fice. She says with a laugh: “I kind of started pro­gres­sively, healthily grow­ing my col­lec­tion. Then I went out of con­trol dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.”</p>
    <p>She now has 77 plants at home – a 1,000 sq ft walk-up apart­ment in East Coast.</p>
    <p>Her plants are thriv­ing, she says, be­cause she is work­ing from home – she has more con­trol over their wa­ter­ing needs and can also move them around ac­cord­ing to the sun­light.</p>
    <p>“It’s very ther­a­peu­tic to care for plants. Some­times you get a come­back kid – a plant that doesn’t do well or looks limp and you blame your­self as a plant par­ent, but af­ter a while or af­ter wa­ter­ing, it starts thriv­ing – it’s very sat­is­fy­ing,” says Ms Law.</p>
    <p>Ms Nu­rul Ati­rah, a 33-year-old civil ser­vant, sim­i­larly de­vel­oped an in­door plant ad­dic­tion in June and has since col­lected about 80 plants.</p>
    <p>The mother of four chil­dren, whose hus­band is also a civil ser­vant, says af­ford­able in­door plants on e-re­tail plat­form Shopee sparked her in­ter­est. The area next to the liv­ing room win­dow in her five-room Bukit Pan­jang flat is now ded­i­cated to her plant col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>“I think stay­ing home so much made me want to do some­thing dif­fer­ent. It re­ally helps me to de­stress and pass time quickly,” she says, adding that her fam­ily has been sup­port­ive of her hobby so far, with her kids nam­ing the plants and pick­ing their favourites.</p>
    <p>Ms Nu­rul, who has ar­ranged her plants on white and brown shelves, stools and step-lad­ders, says the pop of green has made her home a nicer place.</p>
    <p>She says: “Pre­vi­ously there were only two ar­ti­fi­cial plants in that spot. I’ve given them away, they looked a bit sad. Now these plants are all live and I get to see them grow and there’s a va­ri­ety so it con­trib­utes to the aes­thetic of the home.”</p>
    <p>For Ms Ch­eryl Ann Lee, 35, plants have been a big part of her life for the last five years. She has a plant col­lec­tion with more than 120 plants in her four-room Toa Payoh flat.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee, who runs a brand­ing agency with her hus­band and also started a botany side-busi­ness The Botanist & Her Thieves with three friends, bought her cur­rent home be­cause it has a spa­cious bal­cony where most of her plants now re­side.</p>
    <p>Plant par­ent­ing has been es­pe­cially help­ful dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker as more peo­ple spend time at home beaver­ing in front of their com­put­ers.</p>
    <p>“Tend­ing to my plants gives me a men­tal break while work­ing and these snatches of time away from the com­puter screen are a brief dig­i­tal detox,” she says.</p>
    <p>Like Ms Lee, those in­ter­viewed say par­ent­ing plants sat­is­fies their crav­ing to nur­ture and calms their minds. This could ex­plain why there has been a big spike i n de­mand for house­plants dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal psy­chol­o­gist Carol Bal­hetchet says turn­ing to na­ture in a time of iso­la­tion at home is an un­der­stand­able re­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of Covid-19, we were all locked in this ster­ile en­vi­ron­ment of our homes, but we need con­nec­tion to na­ture. More plants give you the feel­ing that you are still con­nected to na­ture. It is an ex­ten­sion of your own space into the out­side world.”</p>
    <p>She adds that on an­other level, pick­ing up new in­ter­ests – be it plants, craft­ing, bak­ing or learn­ing a new lan­guage – is a nat­u­ral way to adapt to cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“When you are iso­lated, it is im­por­tant for your men­tal and emo­tional sta­bil­ity that you are still ac­tive.”</p>
    <p>Ter­ras­capes, a nurs­ery spe­cial­is­ing in ex­otic plants, saw a 10 per cent in­crease in sales. It sold about 1,000 plants in the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April to June af­ter it started re­tail­ing its plants on­line.</p>
    <p>Ter­ras­capes founder Sandy Soh says the trend is in part fu­elled by so­cial me­dia – with clients of­ten post­ing on their ac­counts to share how their plant ba­bies are do­ing.</p>
    <p>In­te­ri­ors brim­ming with plants – termed “jun­ga­lows”, a word play on jun­gle and bun­ga­lows – are also pop­u­lar on­line.</p>
    <p>SG Plant Club, an In­sta­gram page that started post­ing pic­tures of var­i­ous plant col­lec­tions by lo­cal res­i­dents on June 4, al­ready has close to 1,000 fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Leo Tay, founder of nurs­ery The 3 Keys, ob­serves an in­crease in sales of 20 to 25 per cent dur­ing the same pe­riod. The num­ber of fol­low­ers of his In­sta­gram ac­count, which fo­cuses on the plants he re­tails, also dou­bled.</p>
    <p>Pop­u­lar plant bou­tique Tum­ble­weed Plants saw a surge in de­mand for its prod­ucts too.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal well­ness com­pany Su­per Farm­ers’ founder Cynthea Lam says sales of her ur­ban farm­ing kits</p>
    <p>– three sep­a­rate pots of plants grow­ing kang kong, chye sim and kailan – dou­bled dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The veg­eta­bles are ready to har­vest in 14 days – sim­i­lar to the length of a stay-home no­tice pe­riod – mak­ing them pop­u­lar pur­chases.</p>
    <p>Her farm­ing kits can be grown in­doors, even in a ho­tel room.</p>
    <p>She says: “The kits are de­signed for small ur­ban spa­ces like homes or of­fices, They can grow pretty much any­where, on a din­ing ta­ble, on a ledge. They don’t need too much fuss or sun­light.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, or­na­men­tal plants that are easy to take care of have been the most pop­u­lar prod­ucts dur­ing the pan­demic. A Tum­ble­weed spokesman says that the mon­stera de­li­ciosa, a house­plant known for its large leaves with nat­u­ral holes, and the snake plant, known for its tall leaves, have been in hot de­mand lo­cally due to their dis­tinc­tive aes­thetic looks.</p>
    <p>These are also tropical plants that tend to do well i n Sin­ga­pore’s cli­mate.</p>
    <p>The 3 Keys’ Mr Tay says other plant species like the stepha­nia, the ev­er­fresh tree and philo­den­drons have sold well too as they are com­par­a­tively easy to care for and aes­thet­i­cally pleas­ing.</p>
    <p>Mini-bon­sais have also been a hit, al­though they re­quire more daily main­te­nance and care, due to their aes­thetic ap­peal.</p>
    <p>He ex­plains: “When styling plants, a gen­eral rule is to pick either the pot or the plant – which one do you want to see? Some plants have very dra­matic fo­liage so if you want the leaves to be the main at­trac­tion, pick a sim­ple, solid-coloured pot and vice versa.”</p>
    <p>Graphic de­signer Charles Loh, who has a side pro­ject named Mossin­gar­den which cre­ates botan­i­cal ter­rar­i­ums and sells plants, is also an avid plant col­lec­tor. He says plants are some of the most af­ford­able dec­o­ra­tions for the home.</p>
    <p>“Start small, don’t buy some­thing ex­pen­sive or de­signer straight away. Find an un­der­utilised spot in your home – maybe your shelves or win­dow – they can brighten up a lot with plants.”</p>
    <p>While aes­thet­ics may be im­por­tant to bud­ding plant par­ents who want to beau­tify their homes, Mr Soh says that ul­ti­mately, a plant is a liv­ing thing to take care of.</p>
    <p>“Don’t just get a plant that you like. Get a plant that you can grow – some­thing you have the right grow­ing con­di­tions for.”</p>
