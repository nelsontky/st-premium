    <p>A third of Malaysia’s pop­u­la­tion will be placed un­der two weeks of move­ment curbs as coro­n­avirus cases con­tinue to surge in the coun­try af­ter an out­break from a state election last month. The re­stric­tions on the res­i­dents of Kuala Lumpur, Pu­tra­jaya, Se­lan­gor and Sabah will be in place un­til late this month.</p>
    <p>The move­ment re­stric­tions will af­fect some 7.6 mil­lion res­i­dents in the Klang Val­ley – as KL, Pu­tra­jaya and Se­lan­gor dis­tricts are of­ten called – con­sist­ing of 23 per cent of Malaysia’s 32 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Sabah has a pop­u­la­tion of 3.5 mil­lion, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of Malaysians af­fected by the con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der to 11 mil­lion, or 30 per cent of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“All eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties in the Se­lan­gor, Pu­tra­jaya and Kuala Lumpur are still al­lowed,” Mr Is­mail Sabri said. But so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties and cross-dis­trict trav­els are not al­lowed. Those who have to cross dis­trict lines for work are re­quired to show their work passes, he said.</p>
    <p>About a third of Malaysia’s pop­u­la­tion will be placed un­der move­ment re­stric­tions for two weeks as coro­n­avirus cases con­tinue to soar in the coun­try fol­low­ing a re­cent out­break from a state election.</p>
    <p>The con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der (CMCO) for the fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries of Kuala Lumpur and Pu­tra­jaya, and Se­lan­gor state – the coun­try’s most pop­u­lous re­gion and main eco­nomic hub – will be­gin just af­ter mid­night to­mor­row and will last un­til Oct 27, said Se­nior Min­is­ter for Se­cu­rity Is­mail Sabri Yaakob yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>All of Sabah, which held the state election that led to the re­cent up­surge in in­fec­tions, was placed un­der the CMCO from 12.01am to­day.</p>
    <p>“To pre­vent fur­ther spread­ing of the in­fec­tion, the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil has agreed to im­pose the con­di­tional MCO in Se­lan­gor, Kuala Lumpur and Pu­tra­jaya,” said Datuk Seri Is­mail Sabri at his reg­u­lar Covid-19 brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“This will come into force from mid­night Oct 14 un­til Oct 27.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Se­lan­gor state gov­ern­ment, which is con­trolled by the op­po­si­tion Pakatan Hara­pan coali­tion, has called the de­ci­sion “shock­ing” and has asked the Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil (NSC) to re­con­sider its de­ci­sion for the state.</p>
    <p>“The re­sult of the meet­ing ear­lier showed that only Klang, Gom­bak, Hulu Lan­gat and Pe­tal­ing dis­tricts had a wor­ry­ing amount of cases,” Se­lan­gor Men­teri Be­sar Amirudin Shari said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>He said that the state au­thor­i­ties will write to the NSC to re­con­sider its de­ci­sion to im­pose a blan­ket CMCO on Se­lan­gor, Malaysia’s rich­est state and home to 6.5 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The first CMCO ended four months ago on June 10, when Malaysia be­gan the “re­cov­ery MCO” by re­open­ing most busi­nesses and al­low­ing so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties. The more re­laxed “re­cov­ery MCO” is still gen­er­ally in place.</p>
    <p>The move­ment re­stric­tions will af­fect some 7.6 mil­lion res­i­dents in the Klang Val­ley – as Kuala Lumpur, Pu­tra­jaya and Se­lan­gor dis­tricts are of­ten called – con­sist­ing of 23 per cent of Malaysia’s 32 mil­lion pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Sabah has a pop­u­la­tion of 3.5 mil­lion, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of Malaysians af­fected by the CMCO to 11 mil­lion, or 30 per cent of the coun­try’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“All eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties in the Se­lan­gor, Pu­tra­jaya and Kuala Lumpur are still al­lowed,” Mr Is­mail Sabri said.</p>
    <p>But so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties and cross-dis­trict travel are not al­lowed. Those who have to cross dis­trict lines for work are re­quired to show their work passes, he said.</p>
    <p>On Oct 6, Malaysia re­ported 691 new Covid-19 in­fec­tions in a day, a new high for the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, 563 cases were logged, the sec­ond-high­est daily tally.</p>
    <p>Malaysia now has a cu­mu­la­tive to­tal of 16,220 cases, with 5,039 ac­tive cases. Two more deaths were re­ported, to raise the to­tal to 159.</p>
    <p>The lat­est wave of in­fec­tions was caused by the two-week cam­paign­ing that pre­ceded the Sept 26 Sabah state polls, which drew politi­cians and election work­ers from all over Malaysia to the coun­try’s east­ern­most state.</p>
    <p>At that time, Sabah was al­ready suf­fer­ing from a coro­n­avirus up­surge af­ter an out­break at a de­ten­tion cen­tre for il­le­gal mi­grants.</p>
    <p>The politi­cians and election work­ers have been blamed for bring­ing the virus back with them to Penin­su­lar Malaysia and Sarawak.</p>
    <p>Un­der the pre­vi­ous CMCO, most in­dus­tries were al­lowed to con­tinue op­er­a­tions as long as they took health­care pre­cau­tions, such as tak­ing tem­per­a­tures of work­ers and prac­tis­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing. But places of wor­ship, schools and kinder­gartens were shut and sport­ing ac­tiv­i­ties banned. The au­thor­i­ties also mounted road­blocks to curb ve­hic­u­lar travel.</p>
