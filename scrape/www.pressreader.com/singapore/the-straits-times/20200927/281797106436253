    <p>The lo­cal au­thor­i­ties are in­ves­ti­gat­ing a data breach at home-grown ecom­merce cash­back plat­form ShopBack, af­ter the firm made pub­lic an in­ci­dent in­volv­ing unau­tho­rised ac­cess to cus­tomers’ per­sonal data.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for pri­vacy watch­dog, the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion Com­mis­sion, said it has been no­ti­fied of the in­ci­dent. “In­ves­ti­ga­tions are on­go­ing,” he added.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail to cus­tomers on Friday even­ing seen by The Sun­day Times, ShopBack said it be­came aware of unau­tho­rised ac­cess to its sys­tems, which con­tained cus­tomers’ per­sonal data, “a few days ago”.</p>
    <p>It is still in­ves­ti­gat­ing what data has been com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>“To date, we have no rea­son to be­lieve that any of your per­sonal data has been mis­used, how­ever the pos­si­bil­ity still ex­ists,” said the firm, apol­o­gis­ing for the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>“What we can as­sure you is that your cash­back is safe... Your credit cards are safe, as we do not store your 16-digit card num­ber or CVV on any of our sys­tems.”</p>
    <p>ShopBack said it had im­me­di­ately ini­ti­ated an in­ves­ti­ga­tion af­ter the in­ci­dent came to light, and en­gaged lead­ing cy­ber se­cu­rity spe­cial­ists to as­sess the ex­tent of the breach and fur­ther en­hance its safety mea­sures.</p>
    <p>It added that it is cur­rently work­ing with the au­thor­i­ties to in­ves­ti­gate the ex­tent of the dam­age.</p>
    <p>ShopBack said cus­tomers’ ac­count pass­words are en­crypted, but sug­gested they change them as an “added pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure”.</p>
    <p>“We also sug­gest that you do not use the same pass­word on other dig­i­tal plat­forms,” it said, while com­mit­ting to tak­ing steps to min­imise the risk of a sim­i­lar in­ci­dent oc­cur­ring again in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>ShopBack ac­counts can still be used as the plat­form’s busi­ness op­er­a­tions have not been af­fected by the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers can con­tact ShopBack at care@shopback.sg if they have ques­tions re­lated to the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>ShopBack user Cordelia Lee, 24, said she finds un­set­tling the lack of con­fir­ma­tion over what data has been breached on the plat­form.</p>
    <p>While she will be chang­ing her ac­count pass­word, the design firm ex­ec­u­tive said: “I’m ac­tu­ally more con­cerned about how this hap­pened, and am look­ing for­ward to the com­pany shar­ing fu­ture steps in... bet­ter se­cur­ing their cus­tomers’ data.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, bud­get ho­tel man­age­ment and book­ing ser­vices firm RedDoorz said yes­ter­day that one of its IT data­bases suf­fered a breach last week.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, it said no sen­si­tive data per­tain­ing to fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion, such as cus­tomer credit cards or pass­words, was com­pro­mised to the best of its knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>Said a spokesman for the com­pany: “We are tak­ing all the nec­es­sary steps to in­ves­ti­gate this fur­ther and, at the same time, we are con­duct­ing a thor­ough re­view of all our IT sys­tems and pro­tec­tion.”</p>
