    <p>Some Grab users had trou­ble pay­ing for their 11.11 hauls in the early hours of yes­ter­day as the app’s epay­ment fea­ture ran into is­sues.</p>
    <p>Re­gional sales man­ager Aaron Koh, 44, was stuck for over an hour try­ing to use GrabPay to buy a hairdryer for his wife from the Dyson web­site dur­ing the on­line sales event.</p>
    <p>“From about mid­night, I was un­able to get a one-time-pass­word (OTP) from Grab to com­plete my trans­ac­tion and I was also un­able to see my card de­tails,” he said.</p>
    <p>He was able to ac­cess his card de­tails later and re­ceived an OTP at about 1am but he still could not process his pay­ment on the Dyson web­site us­ing GrabPay.</p>
    <p>The is­sue per­sisted when he tried again at about 6.30am.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last evening, Grab said it was aware of the sit­u­a­tion and apol­o­gised for the in­con­ve­nience caused to its GrabPay Master­Card cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“Our pay­ment pro­cess­ing part­ner Tu­tuka ex­pe­ri­enced an ap­prox­i­mately 16-minute down­time early this morn­ing that be­gan slightly af­ter 12am and im­pacted a small num­ber of our users,” said a Grab spokesman. “This is­sue has been rec­ti­fied and we will of­fer as­sis­tance to im­pacted users.”</p>
    <p>Mr Koh was not the only one with is­sues.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers say money trans­ferred to their GrabPay ac­counts for the 11.11 sales is now stuck.</p>
    <p>GrabPay is an elec­tronic wal­let sys­tem which re­quires con­sumers to use a debit or credit card to top up their ac­count be­fore the stored value can be used to pur­chase items.</p>
    <p>“The frus­trat­ing part about the Grab is­sue is that you have to top up the e-wal­let first be­fore you make pay­ment, which means the money you have topped up is stuck in­side and you have to use an­other provider’s card with the same amount of money in­side to make the pay­ment,” Mr Koh added.</p>
    <p>Although he even­tu­ally man­aged to com­plete the trans­ac­tion by us­ing his United Over­seas Bank debit card, Mr Koh is seek­ing a re­fund of over $600 which he had trans­ferred to his GrabPay ac­count specif­i­cally for the pur­chase.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers like Mr Kaw Shi En were up­set with Grab’s ap­par­ent lack of cus­tomer sup­port.</p>
    <p>“I feel dis­ap­pointed... be­cause there were no updates and a lot of peo­ple were left hang­ing,” said the 22-year-old stu­dent, adding that the is­sue was com­pounded by the fact that ear­lier in the week, Grab had pushed out 11.11 deals for the GrabPay card and wal­let fea­tures with e-com­merce sites.</p>
    <p>“I was less af­fected be­cause my trans­ac­tion was rel­a­tively small, but peo­ple spend­ing more money would have lost out,” he said.</p>
