    <p>Some Sin­ga­porean cou­ples are likely to de­lay their plans to marry or have a child as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic dis­rupts their fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity and af­fects their job se­cu­rity, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey.</p>
    <p>These were among the rea­sons cited by about three out of 10 re­spon­dents in a sur­vey com­mis­sioned by the Na­tional Pop­u­la­tion and Tal­ent Di­vi­sion (NPTD) and the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>While the ac­tual im­pact on Sin­ga­pore’s birth rate will come to the fore around nine months later, the find­ings are a mat­ter of con­cern, said Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah, who oversees the NPTD.</p>
    <p>If Covid-19 fur­ther pushes down Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal fer­til­ity rate, the num­ber of Sin­ga­pore­born cit­i­zens in the na­tional pop­u­la­tion will drop even fur­ther, she added.</p>
    <p>It will have knock-on ef­fects, par­tic­u­larly in up­set­ting plans to grow the Sin­ga­porean core, she said.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal fer­til­ity rate (TFR) is be­low the re­place­ment rate of 2.1 – the level at which a pop­u­la­tion re­places it­self. The TFR dipped from 1.82 in 1980 to 1.14 last year, which is among the low­est in the world.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey, con­ducted in June and July this year, polled about 4,100 Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>About half were sin­gles aged 22 to 32 who were in se­ri­ous re­la­tion­ships. The rest were mar­ried in­di­vid­u­als aged 21 to 45.</p>
    <p>About 80 per cent of those who were mar­ried and in­di­cated that they planned to de­lay hav­ing chil­dren said they would do so for up to two years. The rest said the de­lay may go be­yond two years, or were un­sure.</p>
    <p>The main con­cerns of those de­lay­ing hav­ing a child in­clude un­cer­tainty about the global health sit­u­a­tion in the light of Covid-19, shaky eco­nomic and em­ploy­ment prospects, and wor­ries about the safety of health­care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Around 70 per cent of the sin­gles who plan to put off their wed­dings said they would do so for up to two years. Most cited the uncer­tain global health sit­u­a­tion and difficulty of hold­ing a wed­ding cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>The econ­omy and job se­cu­rity wor­ried them, too.</p>
    <p>“As age af­fects fer­til­ity, mar­ry­ing and hav­ing chil­dren later may re­sult in fam­i­lies be­ing un­able to have the num­ber of chil­dren they as­pire to have,” said the NPTD.</p>
    <p>Ms In­dra­nee hopes the $3,000 Baby Sup­port Grant an­nounced yes­ter­day will coax cou­ples to get hitched and be par­ents.</p>
    <p>“We want young cou­ples to know the Gov­ern­ment and the com­mu­nity stand with them, so that they need not de­lay ma­jor life events.”</p>
