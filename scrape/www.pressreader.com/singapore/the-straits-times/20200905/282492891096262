    <p>The reg­u­la­tory arm of the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX RegCo) is block­ing a pro­posed di­vest­ment by Spack­man En­ter­tain­ment Group (SEG), pend­ing a re­view of cer­tain past ac­qui­si­tions.</p>
    <p>The di­rec­tive re­quires SEG to re­view its pre­vi­ous deal­ings to as­sess if they were on nor­mal com­mer­cial terms or if they were prej­u­di­cial to the in­ter­est of mi­nor­ity in­vestors.</p>
    <p>On Aug 18, SEG an­nounced plans to sell its en­tire 43.88 per cent in­ter­est in Spack­man Me­dia Group (SMG) to its sub­stan­tial share­holder, Spack­man Eq­ui­ties Group (SQG), a com­pany listed in Canada.</p>
    <p>The con­sid­er­a­tion of $2.30 per SMG share was the floor price that the board had set.</p>
    <p>SGX RegCo noted that in March 2017, SEG bought one mil­lion SMG shares from cer­tain ex­ist­ing share­hold­ers at US$3 apiece, which in­creased its in­ter­est in SMG from 24.53 per cent to 27.8 per cent.</p>
    <p>SEG then bought close to 5.5 mil­lion SMG shares at US$3 each be­tween Oc­to­ber 2017 and Au­gust 2018, which fur­ther in­creased its stake to 43.88 per cent.</p>
    <p>When SGX RegCo queried SEG on these ac­qui­si­tions, the com­pany ex­plained that the pur­chases were part of a re­struc­tur­ing ex­er­cise in con­nec­tion with a pro­posed list­ing of SMG on the Hong Kong Stock Ex­change.</p>
    <p>SEG also told SGX RegCo that the SMG shares were ac­quired at a sig­nif­i­cant premium to SMG’s net tan­gi­ble as­set value be­cause it was a prof­itable com­pany with the po­ten­tial to grow sig­nif­i­cantly.</p>
    <p>How­ever, con­cerns have been raised about whether these trans­ac­tions were en­tered into on nor­mal com­mer­cial terms and in the in­ter­est of the com­pany and its share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause the di­vest­ment pro­posed this month is at a “sig­nif­i­cantly lower” price than what SEG paid ini­tially, while SEG, SMG and SQG share com­mon di­rec­tors (past and cur­rent), SGX RegCo said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>SGX RegCo has di­rected SEG’s au­dit and risk man­age­ment committee to per­form a “holis­tic re­view” of the past ac­qui­si­tions, in­clud­ing back­ground checks on the ven­dors.</p>
    <p>SEG must also pro­vide SGX RegCo with de­tails of the due dili­gence it per­formed on the past ac­qui­si­tions and the ven­dors.</p>
    <p>The com­pany can­not en­ter into a bind­ing agree­ment in re­la­tion to the pro­posed di­vest­ment un­til the re­view is com­pleted and ticked off by SGX RegCo.</p>
