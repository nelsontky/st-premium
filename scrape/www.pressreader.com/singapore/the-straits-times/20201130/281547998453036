    <p>The plan to form Perikatan Na­sional, a Malaysian coali­tion of mainly Malay par­ties from both sides of the aisle, orig­i­nated from for­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad be­fore the col­lapse of the Pakatan Hara­pan gov­ern­ment he helmed, said Se­nior Min­is­ter for Econ­omy Azmin Ali. He also re­vealed that Tun Dr Ma­hathir was meant to re­main as the new coali­tion’s prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>PETALING JAYA • The plan to form Perikatan Na­sional (PN), a coali­tion of mainly Malay par­ties from both sides of the aisle, orig­i­nated from then Prime Min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad be­fore the col­lapse in Fe­bru­ary of the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) gov­ern­ment that he helmed, said Malaysia’s Se­nior Min­is­ter for Econ­omy Azmin Ali.</p>
    <p>In an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view with The Star pub­lished yes­ter­day, Datuk Seri Azmin, who is also Min­is­ter of In­ter­na­tional Trade and In­dus­try, re­vealed that Tun Dr Ma­hathir was meant to re­main as prime min­is­ter with the new coali­tion, which was to in­clude Dr Ma­hathir’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia as well as then op­po­si­tion par­ties Umno and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS).</p>
    <p>The plan was hatched without the ex­plicit ap­proval of Ber­satu’s al­lies in PH, namely Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim’s Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat (PKR), the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party and Parti Amanah Ne­gara.</p>
    <p>Mr Azmin said that sup­port for Dr Ma­hathir was pre­sented to the palace on Feb 23, in the form of 131 statu­tory dec­la­ra­tions from law­mak­ers of var­i­ous par­ties. A sim­ple ma­jor­ity of 112 MPs is needed to form the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“We were then try­ing very hard to make sure that Dr Ma­hathir would con­tinue to serve as the prime min­is­ter,” Mr Azmin said.</p>
    <p>“That was the meet­ing we had at his house on Feb 23 at 4pm when he met all the six po­lit­i­cal party lead­ers, in­clud­ing Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia pres­i­dent Muhyid­din Yassin, Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, Parti Warisan Sabah pres­i­dent Mohd Shafie Ap­dal, PAS pres­i­dent Ab­dul Hadi Awang, Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak head Abang Jo­hari and my­self.”</p>
    <p>Mr Azmin was then deputy pres­i­dent of PKR.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir, how­ever, un­ex­pect­edly re­signed as prime min­is­ter on Feb 24. The PH gov­ern­ment sub­se­quently col­lapsed when dozens of MPs from Ber­satu and PKR, led by Tan Sri Muhyid­din and Mr Azmin, left and later formed PN.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din was ap­pointed prime min­is­ter on March 1, and now leads the PN ad­min­is­tra­tion with a slim ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>At the time, PN was crit­i­cised for form­ing a “back­door gov­ern­ment” with par­ties that were re­jected by vot­ers at the bal­lot box. PH had de­feated Umno and its al­lies at the his­toric May 2018 gen­eral elec­tion, end­ing their six-decade rule.</p>
    <p>In the in­ter­view, Mr Azmin de­fended PN’s ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“Perikatan is not a back­door gov­ern­ment as there was a va­cancy (for the post of prime min­is­ter). I did not sug­gest at that time – if it (res­ig­na­tion of Dr Ma­hathir) did not hap­pen then – that we knock on the door and take him out and we go in,” said Mr Azmin. “That was not the plan or case.”</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir has said that he re­signed be­cause he could not face the prospect of work­ing with Umno. Po­lit­i­cal ob­servers have spec­u­lated that the plan to form a new gov­ern­ment, termed a “unity” gov­ern­ment by Dr Ma­hathir, was in­tended to foil Mr An­war’s as­cen­sion to the prime min­is­ter post as agreed to by PH be­fore the 2018 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Dr Ma­hathir’s new party, Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air, de­nied Mr Azmin’s claims and said Dr Ma­hathir had no part in the plan to form PN.</p>
    <p>Pe­juang in­for­ma­tion chief Ulya Aqamah Husamudin in­stead claimed that PN was a plot by Mr Azmin and Mr Muhyid­din to over­throw the PH gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“Dr Ma­hathir did not want to break his prom­ise (to al­low Mr An­war to suc­ceed him) and ac­cept sup­port from klep­to­crats,” said Mr Ulya, re­fer­ring to Umno lead­ers who have been charged with graft.</p>
    <p>Mr Azmin said he and Mr Muhyid­din had no choice but to leave PH af­ter Dr Ma­hathir re­signed.</p>
    <p>“We were thrown into a po­lit­i­cal cri­sis when the sit­ting prime min­is­ter, Dr Ma­hathir, re­signed. If Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin didn’t act within that small win­dow, some­one else could have rushed to the palace and pres­sured the palace in or­der to be­come the prime min­is­ter. I would not have al­lowed that to hap­pen. The only op­tion for me and Muhyid­din then was to leave Pakatan,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to him, Dr Ma­hathir could not garner suf­fi­cient sup­port to form a new gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“If you don’t have the num­bers, there is noth­ing much we can do. As there was no Par­lia­ment sit­ting then, un­der the fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion, the King had to de­cide who had the sup­port of the ma­jor­ity to be PM,” Mr Azmin said.</p>
    <p>“Fi­nally, Muhyid­din got that ma­jor­ity. Of course, we came in as a new gov­ern­ment, not through an elec­tion but through a po­lit­i­cal cri­sis. But that cri­sis came about be­cause this man ten­dered his res­ig­na­tion. If Dr Ma­hathir had not ten­dered his res­ig­na­tion that Monday, he would still be prime min­is­ter with a big­ger ma­jor­ity.”</p>
    <p>Asked if he still has any ties with Dr Ma­hathir, who in 1987 gave Mr</p>
    <p>Azmin his first job in pol­i­tics as spe­cial of­fi­cer to Mr An­war, Mr Azmin said he re­garded him as a fa­ther.</p>
    <p>“I still have so much re­spect, love and af­fec­tion for Dr Ma­hathir. He is our states­man,” he said.</p>
    <p>His re­la­tion­ship with Mr An­war, how­ever, has fal­tered. Mr Azmin said he was not to blame for the state of af­fairs.</p>
    <p>“I have served him for 30 years – of­fi­cially for 15 years when (he) held the posts of ed­u­ca­tion and fi­nance min­is­ter and DPM (deputy prime min­is­ter). I also took care of his fam­ily when he was in prison. I thought af­ter he was re­leased from prison, he would come out a bet­ter per­son. Un­for­tu­nately, he be­came a bit­ter per­son – not only for me but for the whole na­tion.”</p>
    <p>There has been much spec­u­la­tion in Malaysia over whether PN will call a snap elec­tion and seek a stronger man­date to gov­ern. Mr Azmin said an elec­tion could have been held last month, were it not for the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>“If you ask me, of course, we are ready to go back to the rakyat (peo­ple) to get the man­date. If you ask me when we should have got­ten the man­date, I would say it should have been last month but, un­for­tu­nately, we are fac­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic,” he said.</p>
    <p>PO­LIT­I­CAL CRI­SIS</p>
