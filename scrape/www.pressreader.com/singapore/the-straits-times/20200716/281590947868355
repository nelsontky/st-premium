    <p>Ac­tiveSG swim­ming com­plexes will be open to the pub­lic for lap swim­ming from 9am to noon on week­days from to­day. Users were pre­vi­ously able to ac­cess the lap pools only from 6.30pm to 9.30pm dur­ing phase two of the post-cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. The time slot of 6.30am to 8.45am re­mains for se­niors.</p>
    <p>Al­though Ac­tiveSG swim­ming com­plexes re­opened on June 19 as part of phase 2 of Sin­ga­pore’s post-cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, Joycelyn Ho rarely re­turned to the Jurong East swim­ming com­plex be­cause the pub­lic ac­cess to lap pools was only from 6.30pm to 9.30pm.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old Re­pub­lic Polytech­nic stu­dent had found it “in­con­ve­nient” to visit the pool be­cause she would usu­ally be rush­ing through as­sign­ments in the evening.</p>
    <p>But yes­ter­day, Ac­tiveSG in­formed its mem­bers that lap swim­mers would be able to use its swim­ming com­plexes on week­days from 9am to noon from to­day, as part of its re­vised swim­ming pool slots “to bet­ter meet the needs of (the) com­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>Ho wel­comed the news, say­ing: “It’s great that we are al­lowed to use the pool in the day now. Pre­vi­ously, when we were al­lowed to en­ter the pool only in the evening, it was re­ally in­con­ve­nient for me.</p>
    <p>“With the day slots, it gives me an op­por­tu­nity to get a quick swim in be­fore the day starts.”</p>
    <p>Another user, Tey Shou Hern, who goes to the Seran­goon swim­ming com­plex once or twice a week, felt that hav­ing more time slots would help to re­duce the num­ber of peo­ple present at any given time.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old said: “It could also help to mit­i­gate the risk of Covid-19 even fur­ther.</p>
    <p>“Book­ings for the dif­fer­ent time slots would not al­ways reach max­i­mum ca­pac­ity and peo­ple that would want to swim at the last minute could also get a chance to use the pool.”</p>
    <p>The re­vised hours ap­ply to the 20 Ac­tiveSG swim­ming com­plexes that are cur­rently in op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The op­er­at­ing hours at Our Tampines Hub, Sengkang, Yio Chu Kang, Jurong Lake and Kal­lang Basin swim­ming pools, which had been ex­tended till 12.30am to cater to lap swim­mers pre­vi­ously, will now close at 11pm “due to the low util­i­sa­tion”.</p>
    <p>Lap swim­ming for se­niors will re­main from 6.30am to 8.45am.</p>
    <p>Those who want to use the pools are still re­quired to make book­ings through the Ac­tiveSG app or web­site.</p>
    <p>From to­day, Ac­tiveSG mem­bers can also pur­chase MyAc­tiveGym, MyAc­tiveSwim and Merdeka Gen­er­a­tion schemes and passes.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers who are on ex­ist­ing pack­ages will be al­lowed to con­tinue us­ing the passes.</p>
    <p>Coun­try clubs have also adopted strict mea­sures to limit the num­ber of peo­ple at pools.</p>
    <p>Apart from re­strict­ing the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed into the pool to 50 and ad­her­ing to safe en­try pro­ce­dures and tem­per­a­ture tak­ing, Kep­pel Club has en­cour­aged swim­mers to don their swim­ming at­tire be­fore ar­rival since it re­opened its pool on July 6.</p>
    <p>It has also im­ple­mented a queue sys­tem for both chang­ing rooms.</p>
    <p>While there are no spe­cific time</p>
    <p>TIME MAN­AGE­MENT</p>
    <p>With the day slots, it gives me an op­por­tu­nity to get a quick swim in be­fore the day starts. ’’</p>
    <p>JOYCELYN HO, Re­pub­lic Polytech­nic stu­dent, on vis­it­ing the Jurong East swim­ming com­plex.</p>
    <p>slots for dif­fer­ent groups of peo­ple, the club has re­served three of its eight lanes for swim­ming lessons.</p>
    <p>Deputy sports man­ager Raz­i­man Rah­man, 41, said: “Mem­bers have been co­op­er­a­tive and un­der­stand the sit­u­a­tion and why the club is im­ple­ment­ing all the safe mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Is­land Coun­try Club has closed its 50m pool and lim­ited ac­cess to the chil­dren’s play pool to the week­ends. Its 25m pool is the only one that is open for gen­eral swim­ming and squad train­ing through­out the week.</p>
    <p>Other mea­sures that are in place in­clude the ban­ning of swim­mers gath­er­ing at pool walls.</p>
    <p>Con­do­mini­ums have also taken steps to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus. Hil­lview Re­gency lim­ited the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed into its main swim­ming pool to 30, while another con­do­minium, Cashew Heights, cleans its pool twice a week now.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that the num­ber of peo­ple in a pool re­mains man­age­able, some con­do­minium man­age­ment teams have in­formed their se­cu­rity guards to be on the look­out to pre­vent over­crowd­ing.</p>
    <p>But even with these pre­cau­tions in place, there are some who still have reser­va­tions about re­turn­ing to the pool.</p>
    <p>Olivia Chew has not gone to the pool in her con­do­minium since the coro­n­avirus struck.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old said: “I have stayed away from the pool be­cause there are more peo­ple us­ing it now. Per­haps work­ing and study­ing from home has freed up more time.</p>
    <p>“I know that the man­age­ment cleans it reg­u­larly and the chlo­rine in the pool is a dis­in­fec­tant but I just gen­er­ally pre­fer to avoid crowded spaces, and would choose to use it when there are fewer peo­ple.”</p>
