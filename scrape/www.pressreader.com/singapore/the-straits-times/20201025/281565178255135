    <p>Q What hap­pens if an emer­gency is de­clared in Malaysia?</p>
    <p>A Par­lia­ment can be sus­pended dur­ing an emer­gency, while by-elec­tions and the gen­eral elec­tion can be post­poned. The fed­eral gov­ern­ment would be em­pow­ered to push through poli­cies that it would nor­mally not be able to.</p>
    <p>Q Who can de­clare an emer­gency?</p>
    <p>A An emer­gency can be an­nounced once the king is sat­is­fied, based on the prime min­is­ter’s ad­vice, that a grave emer­gency ex­ists which threat­ens the se­cu­rity, econ­omy or pub­lic or­der of the na­tion.</p>
    <p>Q What will this emer­gency en­tail?</p>
    <p>A The “eco­nomic emer­gency” that Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin is seek­ing will en­sure that gov­ern­ment spend­ing to curb the Covid-19 pandemic is not jeop­ar­dised by po­lit­i­cal de­vel­op­ments. There would be no mil­i­tary pres­ence on the streets and peo­ple can go about their busi­ness as usual.</p>
    <p>If this is the case, it would be dif­fer­ent from the na­tional emer­gen­cies de­clared in the past, in­clud­ing the one fol­low­ing deadly racial ri­ots in May 1969.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen what pow­ers the gov­ern­ment will ex­er­cise, but it is likely that only po­lit­i­cal pro­cesses will be sus­pended. Laws and ex­pen­di­ture will be ap­proved di­rectly by the ex­ec­u­tive branch of the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Q Why is an emer­gency be­ing con­sid­ered now?</p>
    <p>A The gov­ern­ment is bat­tling a</p>
    <p>Covid-19 out­break, with Sabah be­ing the worst-af­fected area. The state recorded a spike in the num­ber of cases fol­low­ing cam­paign­ing for state polls last month.</p>
    <p>The Muhyid­din gov­ern­ment is also fac­ing an at­tempt by Op­po­si­tion Leader An­war Ibrahim to un­seat it with a claim that he has ma­jor­ity sup­port in Par­lia­ment. Many Malaysians are said to not be keen on a gen­eral elec­tion dur­ing the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>There is a big ques­tion mark over whether Tan Sri Muhyid­din has enough sup­port in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>There are wor­ries that a gen­eral elec­tion could be called even as the num­ber of Covid-19 cases con­tin­ues to rise, should Mr Muhyid­din’s coali­tion col­lapse if he fails to pass next year’s bud­get on Nov 6 due to a lack of sup­port in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Q How many times has Malaysia been un­der an emer­gency?</p>
    <p>A Four times.</p>
    <p>The first was in Septem­ber 1964, when a na­tion­wide emer­gency was called dur­ing the In­done­si­aMalaysia Con­fronta­tion, af­ter In­done­sian sol­diers landed on Malaysian soil. The con­fronta­tion ended in Au­gust 1966.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber 1966, the gov­ern­ment de­clared the Sarawak Emer­gency – the first to be lim­ited to one state. The procla­ma­tion was made fol­low­ing po­lit­i­cal squab­bles in Sarawak linked to moves to oust the chief min­is­ter, Datuk Stephen Ka­long Ningkan. His court ap­peal was re­jected in Au­gust 1968.</p>
    <p>The third emer­gency was called na­tion­wide in 1969, ow­ing to race ri­ots on May 13. Racial clashes had broken out in Kuala Lumpur that day, and by 8pm, po­lice de­clared a cur­few, with sol­diers and po­lice­men de­ployed.</p>
    <p>The ri­ots con­tin­ued the next day, and the gov­ern­ment de­clared a state of emer­gency on May 15 to pre­vent the un­rest from spread­ing to other parts of the coun­try. News­pa­per pub­li­ca­tions were also sus­pended on May 15.</p>
    <p>The Cab­i­net was re­placed by the Na­tional Op­er­a­tions Coun­cil, which gov­erned Malaysia in lieu of the elected gov­ern­ment un­til 1971, when Par­lia­ment was re­stored.</p>
    <p>The fourth emer­gency was called in Novem­ber 1977 i n Ke­lan­tan</p>
    <p>An emer­gency can be an­nounced once the king is sat­is­fied, based on the prime min­is­ter’s ad­vice, that a grave emer­gency ex­ists which threat­ens the se­cu­rity, econ­omy or pub­lic or­der of the na­tion.</p>
    <p>dur­ing a power strug­gle be­tween Umno and Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS).</p>
    <p>The then Men­teri Be­sar, Datuk</p>
    <p>Mo­hamed Nasir from PAS, had re­fused to re­sign when or­dered to by his party, although he had lost the con­fi­dence of the PAS-led state assem­bly. The cri­sis ended in March 1978 with new state polls.</p>
