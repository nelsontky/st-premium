    <p>A teenager who was in­volved in a brawl in Chi­na­town, which also re­sulted in him be­ing in­jured, was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to at least a year of re­for­ma­tive train­ing for be­ing part of an un­law­ful assem­bly and other of­fences.</p>
    <p>Muhammed Shazryl Hykel Ab­dul­lah, 19, will be de­tained in a re­for­ma­tive train­ing cen­tre and made to fol­low a strict reg­i­men that in­cludes foot drills as well as coun­selling.</p>
    <p>A video of the melee on May 10 was cap­tured on a closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion cam­era and later widely shared on so­cial me­dia. The clip shows two groups of peo­ple fight­ing along a cor­ri­dor on the 16th storey of Block 101 Up­per Cross</p>
    <p>Street, Peo­ple’s Park Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Shazryl, who suf­fered lac­er­a­tions on his left thigh and slash wounds on his back, had faced a slew of charges when he was hauled to court ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>On Nov 2, he pleaded guilty to two un­re­lated counts of cheat­ing as well as one count each of be­ing in pos­ses­sion of drug uten­sils and be­ing part of the un­law­ful assem­bly linked to the brawl.</p>
    <p>He also ad­mit­ted to an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>The fight took place dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker from April 7 to June 1, when peo­ple were not al­lowed to leave their homes with­out a valid rea­son or meet oth­ers from dif­fer­ent house­holds to so­cialise. Eight other charges, mainly for cheat­ing, were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Shazryl was on the run from the law for cheat­ing of­fences when the fight broke out.</p>
    <p>After ob­tain­ing a woman’s credit cards from a Dani Zu­las­tri</p>
    <p>Mo­hamed Salim, Shazryl un­law­fully used one of them on Nov 16 last year to buy two iPhones worth nearly $3,000 in to­tal at Mustafa Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Later that day, he used an­other of the credit cards to buy two more iPhones worth nearly $4,000 in to­tal at a store in VivoCity shop­ping mall. All four de­vices were later sold for about $6,000 in to­tal.</p>
    <p>The right­ful owner of the cards made a po­lice re­port and Shazryl was charged with cheat­ing on Dec 2 last year. But he failed to turn up in court on March 25 this year and a war­rant of ar­rest was is­sued against him.</p>
    <p>On May 10, Shazryl and his friends got into a fight with a ri­val group over a woman. Dur­ing the brawl, two peo­ple slashed Shazryl with knives be­fore flee­ing the scene. The po­lice were alerted and Shazryl was found ly­ing be­hind a pil­lar in a carpark, bleed­ing pro­fusely from his wounds. An am­bu­lance then rushed him to the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>The cheat­ing case against Dani, 20, is pend­ing.</p>
