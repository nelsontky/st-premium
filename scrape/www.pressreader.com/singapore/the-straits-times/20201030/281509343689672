    <p>Trav­ellers from China and Aus­tralia’s state of Vic­to­ria will be al­lowed to fly into Sin­ga­pore from next Fri­day with­out the need for quar­an­tine, pro­vided they pass a Covid-19 test on ar­rival.</p>
    <p>The uni­lat­eral move comes as the Repub­lic con­tin­ues to ease its bor­der re­stric­tions cau­tiously and does not change the curbs im­posed in China and Aus­tralia on trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, tourists from the Repub­lic are not al­lowed into the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The move is sig­nif­i­cant for Sin­ga­pore and its avi­a­tion sec­tor, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung told The Straits Times in an ex­clu­sive in­ter­view yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pan­demic, China was one of Changi Air­port’s ma­jor mar­kets, mak­ing up 10.7 per cent of its to­tal traf­fic last year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore al­ready has sim­i­lar ar­range­ments for trav­ellers from Brunei, New Zealand, Viet­nam and all other parts of Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic also has re­cip­ro­cal green lanes for es­sen­tial busi­ness and of­fi­cial travel with sev­eral coun­tries in­clud­ing Malaysia, In­done­sia and Ger­many. The scheme re­quires trav­ellers to fol­low a con­trolled itinerary and be spon­sored by com­pa­nies here.</p>
    <p>An air travel bub­ble with Hong Kong that will al­low leisure trav­ellers from both sides to visit with­out the need to be quar­an­tined is ex­pected to take off next month.</p>
    <p>The Civil Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore said China and Vic­to­ria have com­pre­hen­sive pub­lic health sur­veil­lance sys­tems and have suc­cess­fully con­trolled the spread of the Covid-19 virus.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said that while he does not ex­pect the num­ber of vis­i­tors from China and Vic­to­ria to be high, the eas­ing is sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>“If you cut off air con­nec­tion, we are stran­gled,” he warned.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing con­cerns that re­open­ing the bor­ders in­creases the risk of im­port­ing Covid-19 cases, Mr Ong noted that so far, about 600 trav­ellers have come in through the uni­lat­eral air travel ar­range­ments. None has tested pos­i­tive upon ar­rival.</p>
    <p>Still, Sin­ga­pore is care­ful about who to lift the bar­rier for and takes a “hard-nosed assess­ment” of the virus con­trol mea­sures and their ef­fec­tive­ness in other coun­tries and places.</p>
    <p>“I look at the top line (case num­bers) ev­ery day,” Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>But even that is not good enough, he stressed, be­cause the num­bers also de­pend on how much test­ing is done. “So, we lis­ten to our health­care pro­fes­sion­als in MOH (Min­istry of Health), and they do a very thor­ough assess­ment of the whole epi­demic re­sponse in these places,” he said.</p>
    <p>Asked about Sin­ga­pore’s re­cip­ro­cal green lane agree­ments with Ger­many and In­done­sia, where the num­ber of Covid-19 cases re­mains high, Mr Ong noted that the scheme is limited to busi­ness and of­fi­cial trav­ellers, and comes with re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“They go about their busi­ness through a con­trolled itinerary, they can­not run around, go to hawker cen­tres or take a roller-coaster ride at Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios... We re­ally man­age the risk,” he said.</p>
    <p>Air­port work­ers who come into close con­tact with trav­ellers will be re­quired to don full-body per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment, which in­cludes gog­gles, gloves and gowns, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>They also have to take a Covid-19 test ev­ery two weeks, with about 2,500 who have al­ready un­der­gone the first round of test­ing re­port­ing neg­a­tive re­sults.</p>
    <p>The stepped-up mea­sures come af­ter two air­port work­ers at Changi’s Ter­mi­nal 3 tested pos­i­tive for the virus re­cently, said the min­is­ter.</p>
