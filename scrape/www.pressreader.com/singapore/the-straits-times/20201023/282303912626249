    <p>•</p>
    <p>Se­lec­tion prob­lems for Manch­ester City man­ager Pep Guardi­ola usu­ally take the form of who to leave out.</p>
    <p>But with the squad hit by an in­jury cri­sis, a shorter-than-usual pre-sea­son and Covid-19 is­sues, it may be the last men stand­ing who make the team, ac­cord­ing to mid­fielder Ilkay Gun­do­gan.</p>
    <p>Kevin de Bruyne, Gabriel Je­sus, Aymeric La­porte and Nathan Ake all missed Wed­nes­day’s 3-1 Cham­pi­ons League Group C open­ing win over Porto.</p>
    <p>City then re­ceived an­other blow when Fer­nand­inho was ruled out for up to six weeks after suf­fer­ing a leg in­jury late in the game.</p>
    <p>“I think we’re strug­gling at the mo­ment,” Gun­do­gan told BT Sport.</p>
    <p>“Fer­nand­inho went off in the last minute. We have a few in­jured play­ers. We have play­ers in dif­fer­ent con­di­tions. Even me, I’m not 100 per cent yet be­cause I was out with Covid.</p>
    <p>“We’re all in dif­fer­ent mo­ments. It’s the chal­lenge this sea­son and it’s not go­ing to end for a while, but we will take ev­ery game as it comes. We have enough play­ers who have the qual­ity to play.</p>
    <p>“It’s not go­ing to be dif­fi­cult for Pep to choose the 11 be­cause some play­ers will be tired, they can’t play ev­ery game, oth­ers need to play.</p>
    <p>IT IS WHAT IT IS</p>
    <p>We’re all in dif­fer­ent mo­ments. It’s the chal­lenge this sea­son and it’s not go­ing to end for a while, but we will take ev­ery game as it comes. We have enough play­ers who have the qual­ity to play.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, we’re glad we have a big squad but not ev­ery­one is there yet and not ev­ery­one is at 100 per cent.”</p>
    <p>With a tax­ing sched­ule ahead, Guardi­ola ex­pects more in­juries to fol­low.</p>
    <p>City face an­other 17 games this year with all six Cham­pi­ons League group-stage matches packed into a seven-week stretch either side of the Novem­ber in­ter­na­tional break.</p>
    <p>They have strug­gled to hit the ground run­ning this term and Luis Diaz’s solo ef­fort put the visi­tors in front in the first half.</p>
    <p>But Ser­gio Aguero lev­elled with a con­tentious penalty and the Premier League side’s qual­ity shone through after half-time.</p>
    <p>Gun­do­gan’s free kick and sub­sti­tute Fer­ran Tor­res’ fine fin­ish moved City to the top of Group C.</p>
    <p>“It’s a good start for us,” said Guardi­ola.</p>
    <p>“We knew the games at home you have to win in this com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>“(Fer­nand­inho) is the bad news, he has a mus­cle prob­lem so he will be a big loss. In this pe­riod, we need ev­ery­one but with this cal­en­dar, it hap­pens.”</p>
    <p>Given that La­porte and Fer­nand­inho, who can fill in at the back, are out, while John Stones is out of favour, Eric Gar­cia will have an im­por­tant role to play for now.</p>
    <p>The Spain de­fender, who did well against Porto, is into the fi­nal year of his deal and was close to seal­ing a move back to Barcelona dur­ing the trans­fer win­dow.</p>
    <p>La Ma­sia grad­u­ate Gar­cia has turned down an ex­ten­sion as he is keen to re­turn to the Nou Camp, but Guardi­ola re­mains hope­ful an agree­ment can be struck with the 19-year-old.</p>
    <p>“I know he wanted to leave, but he’s go­ing to stay and maybe we can se­duce him this year to ex­tend the con­tract with us,” the Cata­lan said.</p>
    <p>“He’s a guy who is so sta­ble in many things and we’re so happy.”</p>
    <p>ILKAY GUN­DO­GAN, City mid­fielder, who scored be­fore be­ing taken off and is still not fully fit after over­com­ing Covid.</p>
