    <p>While pi­lot tri­als for small-scale shows are wel­come news, the slow time­line for the re­open­ing of per­for­mance venues has frus­trated mem­bers of the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple have drawn com­par­isons to cin­e­mas, which re­opened in July, and meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) events which will al­low up to 250 par­tic­i­pants next month.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC) says more cau­tion is re­quired for per­form­ing arts com­pared with these two sec­tors: “The na­ture of arts and cul­tural events is unique. In live per­for­mances, un­like in the cinema or at Mice events, per­form­ers in­ter­act with each other on a stage and may be un­masked.</p>
    <p>“Per­form­ing ac­tiv­i­ties such as singing or per­form­ing on wind and brass in­stru­ments are also higher-risk ac­tiv­i­ties, as there is a greater ex­pul­sion of res­pi­ra­tory droplets and po­ten­tial virus par­ti­cles.”</p>
    <p>Hence the tri­als, which aim to clar­ify op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures and en­sure safety at venues. Be­sides mea­sures for per­form­ers and crew, safety mea­sures for au­di­ences need to be taken into ac­count, such as avoid­ing un­nec­es­sary con­gre­ga­tions and mit­i­gat­ing po­ten­tial traf­fic choke points.</p>
    <p>The spokesman says the NAC is work­ing with about 13 arts groups and free­lancers on about 10 pro­grammes cov­er­ing dif­fer­ent art forms, and has re­ceived 12 ap­pli­ca­tions from groups and in­di­vid­u­als who want to be part of the pi­lot.</p>
    <p>The tri­als, which started last Fri­day with the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra, will con­tinue un­til the middle of next month. The NAC, to­gether with the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, will re­view the out­come of the tri­als.</p>
    <p>The spokesman adds: “For now, the safety of our artists, crews and wider com­mu­nity is our im­me­di­ate con­cern.”</p>
