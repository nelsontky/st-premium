    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 18 and above will be able to re­deem their $100 Sin­gapo Re­dis­cov­ers vouch­ers and check their bal­ance on­line from Dec 1, with phys­i­cal coun­ters to be set up across the island to help those in need of as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>From next month to June next year, el­i­gi­ble users can browse and book stay­ca­tions, at­trac­tion tick­ets and lo­cal tours through five on­line book­ing plat­forms: Changi Rec­om­mends, Glob­alTix, Trav­eloka, Trip.com and Klook.</p>
    <p>Adult Sin­ga­pore­ans will also be able to pur­chase up to six sub­sidised tick­ets for at­trac­tions and tours – each at $10 off – for fam­ily mem­bers un­der 18.</p>
    <p>The $320 mil­lion scheme, an­nounced in Au­gust, is the first na­tional dig­i­tal-only voucher pro­gramme to be rolled out by the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Pro­vid­ing de­tails on the redemp­tion process yes­ter­day, Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan de­scribed the de­vel­op­ment of the scheme as a mon­u­men­tal task.</p>
    <p>EASY REDEMP­TION PROCESS We have de­signed the redemp­tion process to be safe, easy and in­clu­sive for all Sin­ga­pore­ans, and we hope that they will take this op­por­tu­nity to sup­port tourism busi­nesses while re­dis­cov­er­ing what they love about Sin­ga­pore. SIN­GA­PORE TOURISM BOARD CHIEF EX­EC­U­TIVE KEITH TAN</p>
    <p>“We have de­signed the redemp­tion process to be safe, easy and in­clu­sive for all Sin­ga­pore­ans, and we hope that they will take this op­por­tu­nity to sup­port tourism busi­nesses while re­dis­cov­er­ing what they love about Sin­ga­pore,” he said at a me­dia briefing.</p>
    <p>The vouch­ers, part of a do­mes­tic cam­paign to keep Sin­ga­pore’s strug­gling tourism sec­tor afloat, can be spent on ap­proved ho­tels, at­trac­tions and tours, but can­not be re­deemed for cruises, re­tail shop pur­chases or food and bev­er­age, un­less as part of a bun­dled pack­age.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble prod­ucts will be marked on the book­ing plat­forms with the Sin­gapo Re­dis­cov­ers Vouch­ers icon, STB said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter se­lect­ing a prod­uct, users will have the op­tion of us­ing the vouch­ers – which come in deno-mi­na­tions of $10 – at the check­out page.</p>
    <p>While SingPass ver­i­fi­ca­tion is used to pre­vent fraud, data will not be shared with ex­ter­nal book­ing part­ners, STB said.</p>
    <p>Those who find it dif­fi­cult to use dig­i­tal vouch­ers can visit any of the 69 phys­i­cal coun­ters set up across the island for as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Most will be lo­cated at com­mu­nity cen­tres or within a fiveminute walk from them, STB said. Book­ing coun­ters will also be avail­able at se­lected malls and SingPost lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The vouch­ers are non-trans­fer­able, STB said, adding that it takes a se­ri­ous view of abuses such as fraud, prof­i­teer­ing and re­sale of the vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>Those who abuse the scheme may have their vouch­ers for­feited, and may even be re­ferred to the po­lice, it said.</p>
    <p>The tourism board will also keep a look­out for price hikes and other un­eth­i­cal busi­ness prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Er­rant mer­chants and book­ing part­ners face penal­ties, in­clud­ing re­moval from the pro­gramme, it said.</p>
    <p>More than 200 mer­chants have signed up to of­fer prod­ucts for redemp­tion thus far.</p>
    <p>A bi­cy­cle tour of the Pu­lau Ubin rain­for­est and Chek Jawa Wet­lands, as well as ho­tel stays bun­dled with at­trac­tion tick­ets are among op­tions that will be avail­able for book­ing.</p>
    <p>More deals will be rolled out through next June, Mr Tan said, urg­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans not to rush to use the vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>STB said it ap­pointed third-party book­ing sites as redemp­tion plat­forms to in­clude as many mer­chants as pos­si­ble and to en­sure sound cy­ber se­cu­rity prac­tices.</p>
    <p>“The in­tent is re­ally to help rep­re­sent hun­dreds of these tourism busi­nesses at scale, and a lot of the small mer­chants who may not have their own book­ing sys­tem. This is the fastest way to get it up and the most wide-reach­ing to be in­clu­sive of all these busi­nesses,” a spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The plat­forms also add value by pro­vid­ing phys­i­cal book­ing coun­ters, ad­di­tional mar­ket­ing re­sources and ser­vices such as shut­tle buses for se­niors, STB said.</p>
    <p>Each of the five book­ing sites will have dif­fer­ent of­fer­ings, giv­ing con­sumers a sim­i­lar ex­pe­ri­ence to shop­ping for a hol­i­day, it added.</p>
