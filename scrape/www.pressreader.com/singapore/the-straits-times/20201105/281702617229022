    <p>The surge in de­mand for TraceTo­gether to­kens last month was higher than the Gov­ern­ment had ex­pected, said Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Janil Puthuc­heary.</p>
    <p>He told the House yes­ter­day that the Gov­ern­ment had an­tic­i­pated it would need to per­suade more peo­ple to join the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme in­stead.</p>
    <p>“The con­cern at the time was whether or not there would be enough de­mand, so we wanted to be pru­dent in terms of the pro­duc­tion, (and) launch the process early even as pro­duc­tion was ramp­ing up,” he said in re­sponse to Dr Tan Wu Meng (Jurong GRC).</p>
    <p>Dr Tan had asked for the num­ber of to­kens dis­trib­uted at a TraceTo­gether mo­bile booth in Cle­menti Mall on Oct 25, as well as what lessons can be drawn from early dis­tri­bu­tion ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>He re­counted how his res­i­dents said the to­kens were out of stock 12 min­utes after col­lec­tion at the mall started at 11am that day.</p>
    <p>Dr Janil said 762 to­kens were dis­trib­uted at Cle­menti Mall on Oct 25 and that “de­mand was very high”.</p>
    <p>The dis­tri­bu­tion of to­kens started in Septem­ber, and res­i­dents could col­lect them at 38 com­mu­nity cen­tres (CCs) last month. But de­mand spiked after the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced that TraceTo­gether would be made manda­tory to en­ter places such as restau­rants and shop­ping malls.</p>
    <p>The long queues at cer­tain CCs prompted the Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group to halt to­ken dis­tri­bu­tion, be­fore restart­ing the process in lim­ited fash­ion from last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Dis­tri­bu­tion has re­sumed at Mar­sil­ing, Wood­grove and Yew Tee CCs, and will be ex­tended to the re­main­ing CCs from now un­til next month.</p>
    <p>Dr Janil said the Gov­ern­ment had also not an­tic­i­pated the ex­tent to which peo­ple is­land­wide would go to var­i­ous venues in or­der to col­lect to­kens.</p>
    <p>“Hence, we have al­tered our dis­tri­bu­tion plan so that a given CC is dis­tribut­ing to­kens only to res­i­dents of that area,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mount­bat­ten) asked if TraceTo­gether check­ins at cin­e­mas would be­come com­pul­sory on Nov 16 as pre­vi­ously an­nounced, not­ing that Mount­bat­ten res­i­dents can start col­lect­ing to­kens only from Dec 14.</p>
    <p>He also asked what res­i­dents should do in the event that their to­ken is dam­aged or runs out of bat­tery. The to­ken has a six-month bat­tery life.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Dr Janil said com­pul­sory TraceTo­gether check-ins with the app or to­ken will not come into force any­where un­til to­ken dis­tri­bu­tion has been rolled out to all CCs.</p>
    <p>This means the public can con­tinue to use older meth­ods of SafeEn­try such as by scan­ning NRIC bar codes for now.</p>
    <p>On re­plac­ing dam­aged to­kens or to­kens that have ex­hausted their bat­ter­ies, he said the Gov­ern­ment will give an up­date closer to the end of the dis­tri­bu­tion process when it has a clearer idea of de­mand.</p>
    <p>“Will we have a sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore where we have to think of a re­place­ment plan for one mil­lion to­kens or two mil­lion to­kens or what­ever the num­ber is in be­tween? (This) may then tell us how many col­lec­tion points or ex­change points (we need),” he added.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party MP Ger­ald Giam (Alju­nied GRC) sug­gested dis­tribut­ing TraceTo­gether to­kens to stu­dents in schools be­fore the end of the school term this year, so that par­ents do not need to queue at CCs to col­lect them for their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>He also called for more public ed­u­ca­tion about the TraceTo­gether app, which per­forms the same func­tion as the to­ken, in or­der to re­duce queues at CCs. The app – which has drawn complaints about drain­ing phone bat­ter­ies – should be im­proved as well so more users are will­ing to down­load it, he said.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, Dr Janil said par­ents have al­ready been col­lect­ing to­kens at CCs for their chil­dren, and that some schools do al­low their stu­dents to carry smart­phones, which means they could use the TraceTo­gether app.</p>
    <p>“I agree with (Mr Giam) that fur­ther public ed­u­ca­tion is needed to... re­duce mis­in­for­ma­tion about what the app does,” said Dr Janil, ac­knowl­edg­ing that the app has had is­sues with bat­tery drain owing to the dif­fi­culty in op­ti­mis­ing the app for the wide va­ri­ety of phone mod­els used by the public.</p>
    <p>“The team is con­tin­u­ally im­prov­ing the app and we have (al­ready) seen a sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ment in per­for­mance.”</p>
    <p>PRU­DENT AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>The con­cern at the time was whether or not there would be enough de­mand, so we wanted to be pru­dent in terms of the pro­duc­tion, (and) launch the process early even as pro­duc­tion was ramp­ing up.</p>
    <p>SE­NIOR MIN­IS­TER OF STATE FOR COM­MU­NI­CA­TIONS AND IN­FOR­MA­TION JANIL PUTHUC­HEARY, say­ing that the Gov­ern­ment had an­tic­i­pated it would need to per­suade more peo­ple to join the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme.</p>
