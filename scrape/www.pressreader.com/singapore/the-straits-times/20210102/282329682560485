    <p>Covid-19 has ce­mented the dig­i­tal space as new fer­tile ground for crim­i­nals, and the police have adapted their tac­tics to deal with the del­uge of op­por­tunis­tic on­line scams and phish­ing at­tacks.</p>
    <p>There was a surge in e-com­merce scams dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, said a police spokesman.</p>
    <p>“The safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, which re­sulted in move­ment re­stric­tions... saw more peo­ple mak­ing on­line pur­chases.”</p>
    <p>Scam­mers took ad­van­tage of sup­ply short­ages in items such as face masks and hand sani­tiser to prey on un­sus­pect­ing vic­tims, he added.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to mid-year crime sta­tis­tics re­leased in August, e-com­merce scams were the most com­monly re­ported, with some 2,089 cases from Jan­uary to June last year, up from 1,202 in the same pe­riod of 2019. Many of them took place on dig­i­tal plat­forms such as Carousell and Face­book.</p>
    <p>Scam­mers also im­per­son­ated Min­istry of Health of­fi­cials to ob­tain per­sonal data and in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Phish­ing scams in­volv­ing e-mails and text mes­sages con­tain­ing fake of­fers or in­for­ma­tion on Covid-19 pay­outs also be­came preva­lent.</p>
    <p>These aim to trick vic­tims into di­vulging their credit or debit card de­tails and one-time pass­words, said the police spokesman.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse, the police have ramped up public ed­u­ca­tion and aware­ness ef­forts. The In­ter-Min­istry Com­mit­tee on Scams was set up in March last year to co­or­di­nate joint ef­forts be­tween the police and other govern­ment agen­cies.</p>
