    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong ex­tended most of its so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, such as a pub­lic gath­er­ing limit of four peo­ple and manda­tory mask wear­ing, for an­other week as the gov­ern­ment said the city is not yet ready to re­lax re­stric­tions aimed at curb­ing the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said “con­di­tions” were not right for Hong Kong to fur­ther re­lax ma­jor so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“It’s a mat­ter of pru­dence,” she added.</p>
    <p>The city yes­ter­day re­ported five new Covid-19 cases, tak­ing the num­ber of con­firmed cases in Hong Kong to 5,261. There have been 105 re­lated deaths.</p>
    <p>Among the new cases, four are im­ported and one is lo­cally trans­mit­ted with an un­known source of in­fec­tion. The im­ported cases are from In­dia, Bri­tain, Rus­sia and France.</p>
    <p>Start­ing Fri­day, Hong Kongers will, how­ever, be able to join lo­cal tours of up to 30 peo­ple each, and at­tend wed­ding cer­e­monies with a max­i­mum of 50 guests, of­fi­cials were cited by the South China Morn­ing Post (SCMP) as say­ing. Pre­vi­ously, tour groups were capped at four peo­ple and wed­ding cer­e­monies were lim­ited to 20 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Sophia Chan said yes­ter­day at a press con­fer­ence that the gov­ern­ment was adopt­ing tar­geted mea­sures in its bid to re­duce virus trans­mis­sion in the com­mu­nity, SCMP re­ported.</p>
    <p>Un­der the lat­est ar­range­ment, the num­ber of peo­ple al­lowed in busi­ness meet­ings will be raised to 50 from the cur­rent 20. Sports ac­tiv­i­ties in swim­ming pools can in­volve more than four team mem­bers.</p>
