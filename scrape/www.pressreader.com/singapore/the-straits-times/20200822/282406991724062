    <p>Be­tween an $85,000 Class 2 race and a $250,000 Group 2 fea­ture, both over the same Poly­track 1,200m, which would you choose?</p>
    <p>Of course, the Class 2 race is an eas­ier tar­get, but what if your horse is not with­out any glim­mer of hope for the big­ger tar­get?</p>
    <p>Well, Sin­ga­pore trainer Mok Zhan Lun de­cided to have a roll of the dice at the Merlion Tro­phy, af­ter his charge River Ra­di­ance over­came ad­ver­sity to run a gal­lant first-up third in a Class 2 race over the Poly­track 1,100m a fort­night ago.</p>
    <p>He just couldn’t pass up the rare chance of ad­dress­ing that void on his 10-year re­sume – a fea­ture-race win.</p>
    <p>River Ra­di­ance is un­doubt­edly his small sta­ble’s only hope to help him hit that elu­sive mile­stone.</p>
    <p>His Poly­track spe­cial­ist – all four wins over 1,100m or 1,200m – al­ready holds a special place in his heart. River Ra­di­ance gave him his 200th win at Kranji on July 19 last year.</p>
    <p>Although it looks a big ask with the likes of five-time Group 3 win­ner Bold Thruster, nine-time win­ner Sky­walk and ris­ing sprinter Sur­pass Nat­u­ral in the line-up, Mok is thrilled to have a ticket in to­mor­row’s big race.</p>
    <p>“As he runs well on Poly­track, I thought why not give him a go in the Merlion Tro­phy. It’s the only sprint tro­phy race on Poly­track as well,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I was very happy with his last run. He got gal­loped on and still came in third (to Sa­cred Rebel).</p>
    <p>“With­out that in­ci­dent, I’m not say­ing he would have won, but he could have fin­ished closer.</p>
    <p>“He came back with lac­er­a­tions to his leg, he’s over it now as it was only a skin is­sue.”</p>
    <p>“He has def­i­nitely im­proved on his race fit­ness af­ter that first run.”</p>
    <p>Mok was pleased with River Ra­di­ance’s fi­nal gal­lop on Wed­nes­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>“He did it ef­fort­lessly. I was happy with that. The horse is fit and well,” said the han­dler, whose charge Dr Grig­oros was voted Poly­track cham­pion horse in 2011.</p>
    <p>River Ra­di­ance has at­tempted three fea­ture races be­fore.</p>
    <p>He was un­placed in the Group 2 Stew­ards’ Cup and Sil­ver Bowl, both on turf, but was fourth in the Group 3 New Year Cup on the Poly­track.</p>
    <p>“I tested him twice over longer trips, but it didn’t work out. From now on, I will keep him to sprint races on the Poly­track,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mok has booked Marc Lerner for the ride to­mor­row. The French­man was also the pi­lot in the Stew­ards’ Cup.</p>
