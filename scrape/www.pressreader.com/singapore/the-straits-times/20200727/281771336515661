    <p>Af­ter al­most four months of hav­ing their premises shut­tered by the Covid-19 pan­demic, op­er­a­tors of sports cen­tres in Malaysia are now dust­ing their equip­ment in an­tic­i­pa­tion of groups re­turn­ing to the courts.</p>
    <p>The re­turn of con­tact sports was one of the last to be an­nounced as the coun­try relaxed mea­sures in­tro­duced as part of the move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO), which kicked in on March 18.</p>
    <p>Mohd Er­wan Ma­zlan, who owns Frenzy Sports Arena in Shah Alam,</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor, is grate­ful he can re­open the in­door venue which pro­vides courts for badminton and fut­sal.</p>
    <p>“It has been a long wait, I’m now able to gen­er­ate some in­come. Af­ter so long, my fam­ily and I are fi­nally ‘breath­ing’,” said the 36-year-old.</p>
    <p>He added that it has only been a week since the an­nounce­ment and he is un­clear how things will play out. “But I’m hope­ful. I’m slowly pick­ing up the pieces and soldier­ing on,” he said.</p>
    <p>Malaysia on July 15 fi­nally lifted the ban on con­tact-sports train­ing venues, al­low­ing fut­sal acad­e­mies and sports fa­cil­i­ties, among oth­ers, to re­open.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the MCO on such venues na­tion­wide has been dev­as­tat­ing.</p>
    <p>Many sport cen­tres have ei­ther per­ma­nently closed or been bought over at bar­gain prices.</p>
    <p>The re­open­ing came al­most four months af­ter the Malaysian govern­ment im­posed a par­tial lock­down, with Malaysians barred from step­ping out of their homes un­less it was ab­so­lutely nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, many eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties in the coun­try ground to a halt.</p>
    <p>Within the first seven weeks of the MCO, the coun­try re­port­edly recorded RM63 bil­lion (S$20.6 bil­lion) in losses, bleed­ing more than RM2 bil­lion daily.</p>
    <p>As the coun­try re­opened, Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin on July 13 said Malaysia could not af­ford another par­tial lock­down.</p>
    <p>He warned the public against com­pla­cency as new clus­ters have been re­ported in re­cent weeks in dif­fer­ent parts of the coun­try af­ter re­stric­tions were first eased on May 4.</p>
    <p>Mr Freddy Lee, who runs a fut­sal fa­cil­ity in Pe­tal­ing Jaya, said that like many busi­nesses, op­er­a­tors of sports fa­cil­i­ties are strug­gling to stay afloat.</p>
    <p>“I al­most lost my house, ev­ery­thing, in my at­tempt to brave the Covid-19 storm. I tried very hard not to let go of any of my staff as I know ev­ery­one is strug­gling, but I had to use all my sav­ings.</p>
    <p>“Call it a bad busi­ness move but I can’t bear leav­ing some 20 of my staff in the ditch dur­ing this dif­fi­cult time. (But) this also means that we can’t af­ford another lock­down. It will per­ma­nently bury us,” Mr Lee, 39.</p>
    <p>He said he would need at least RM35,000 ev­ery month to cover salaries and rent.</p>
    <p>“I will op­er­ate by en­forc­ing a strict stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dure (SOP).</p>
    <p>“It’s my way of thank­ing the govern­ment (for al­low­ing the seg­ment to re­open) and my at­tempt to avoid a new clus­ter from emerg­ing,” added Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>Op­er­a­tors say that be­sides lim­it­ing their venues to only play­ers, body tem­per­a­ture checks are re­quired and visitors must down­load a con­tact-trac­ing app called MySe­jahtera.</p>
    <p>Peak hours at such fa­cil­i­ties are gen­er­ally be­tween 9pm and 11pm.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on the lo­ca­tion, th­ese fa­cil­i­ties charge be­tween RM100 and RM140 per hour for the use of a court.</p>
    <p>To date, the govern­ment has al­lo­cated RM45 bil­lion to cush­ion the blow of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But this still did not pre­vent thou­sands of busi­nesses from go­ing into per­ma­nent clo­sure, with un­em­ploy­ment in the coun­try hit­ting 5.3 per cent, the high­est since the 1980s.</p>
    <p>De­spite los­ing tens of thou­sands of ring­git dur­ing the MCO, Mr Er­wan said he re­mains hope­ful that peo­ple will re­turn.</p>
    <p>“The first few days of re­open­ing, the re­sponses were great as peo­ple were itch­ing to get back to their nor­mal sports rou­tine with their friends, but see­ing how se­ri­ous the im­pact of the pan­demic was, I made sure to fol­low the SOP.</p>
    <p>“We don’t al­low kids to en­ter our premises and no spec­ta­tors are al­lowed as well, only play­ers,” he added.</p>
    <p>Stress­ing that own­ers like him can­not af­ford another lock­down, Mr Er­wan said: “Look at how it’s im­pacted us all. But what­ever it is, health is No. 1.</p>
    <p>“I truly hope Malaysians stay dis­ci­plined. If you need to be quar­an­tined, do so. Just like sports, it’s team­work.”</p>
