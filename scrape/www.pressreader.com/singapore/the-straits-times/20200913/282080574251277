    <p>Open-air ban­quets with live auctions – a sta­ple of the Hun­gry Ghost Fes­ti­val – are con­spic­u­ously miss­ing this year. But cater­ers are still serv­ing up food – for both the dead and liv­ing – in the form of mini buf­fets, bento meals and packed frozen cooked food.</p>
    <p>Shi Cheng Ba Hai Gong tem­ple in Tampines, for in­stance, or­dered 85 sets of frozen food items for use as of­fer­ings to the dead dur­ing its prayer ser­vice re­cently.</p>
    <p>Each set, from food-and-bev­er­age com­pany Pin Si Kitchen, had four frozen dishes – in­clud­ing abalone mus­tard rice and pork belly – and a jar of XO sauce, packed in a cooler bag. Devo­tees took home the sets for free af­ter the ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Last year, the tem­ple or­gan­ised a 60-ta­ble ban­quet for its mem­bers at the Hous­ing Board block where it is lo­cated.</p>
    <p>Madam Cather­ine Ng, 54, chair­man of the tem­ple’s sev­enth-month com­mit­tee, says: “Since we can­not do that this year, this is one way to cheer up our mem­bers – giv­ing them restau­rant dishes, which they can dine on at home.”</p>
    <p>As re­li­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions are not al­lowed to hold food re­cep­tions or have on-site din­ing with prayer ser­vices this year, cater­ers have tai­lored de­liv­ery menus for the sev­enth lu­nar month, which started on Aug 19 and runs till Wednesday. The food can be used as of­fer­ings or dis­trib­uted to wor­ship­pers.</p>
    <p>Cater­ers such as Pin Si Kitchen and Poh Huat Restau­rant in Have­lock Road, which are usu­ally at their busiest dur­ing the sev­enth month, have come up with al­ter­na­tives to make up for rev­enue lost from the can­cel­la­tion of sit-down events.</p>
    <p>Last year, Pin Si Kitchen had rev­enue of $2.2 mil­lion from sit-down events dur­ing the fes­ti­val. This year, the fig­ure is less than half that.</p>
    <p>To get around safe-dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions, the com­pany launched sev­enth-month de­liv­ery set menus, with prices start­ing at $198 for an eight-course meal for 10 peo­ple. It also of­fers in­di­vid­u­ally packed bento meals, such as its sig­na­ture Kong Bak Pau in a $7.90 high-tea set.</p>
    <p>Pin Si Kitchen has also been sell­ing frozen cooked food, such as whole chicken and whole duck, which are suit­able for use as of­fer­ings, on its Face­book page since Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Mr Edi­son Oh, 38, its man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, says: “The pan­demic has changed the game and the industry has to change.”</p>
    <p>Over at fam­ily-owned Poh Huat Restau­rant, which has been in the out­door cater­ing business since 1993, di­rec­tor Dave Lim, 42, cre­ated mini buf­fets and bento meals fea­tur­ing its sig­na­ture curry chicken.</p>
    <p>Its rev­enue for the fes­ti­val has dropped to barely 3 per cent of the same pe­riod last year, when it catered food for 2,000 ta­bles.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim says: “Mini buf­fets and bento meals have never been part of our core business, but we have to adapt to the cir­cum­stances.”</p>
    <p>Mr Goh Kiam Eng, 47, and his fam­ily used frozen food items from Pin Si Kitchen, such as braised chicken with chest­nut, as of­fer­ings. In pre­vi­ous years, they usu­ally cooked the food for of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh, who owns an elec­tri­cal en­gi­neer­ing com­pany, says his mother-in-law, who picked up on­line shop­ping dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, or­dered from the caterer’s Face­book page. His fam­ily ate the food af­ter the prayers.</p>
    <p>He adds: “Buy­ing frozen food saves time and en­ergy. It is a mod­ern way to up­keep cus­toms and tra­di­tion.”</p>
    <p>Other than ban­quets, also miss­ing this year are the colour­ful out­door getai shows, which have moved on­line to plat­forms such as Face­book and YouTube.</p>
    <p>Getai per­form­ers pre­vi­ously in­ac­tive on social me­dia found them­selves scram­bling to es­tab­lish an on­line pres­ence and ex­plore other rev­enue streams.</p>
    <p>Veteran Liu Lin­gling, 57, rapped in English – for the first time – for a Food­panda com­mer­cial ti­tled Aun­tie Knows The Real Deals, which was up­loaded to the food­de­liv­ery plat­form’s YouTube chan­nel on Sept 6.</p>
    <p>In it, she plays a tech-savvy grand­mother who dis­penses shop­ping ad­vice to her fam­ily.</p>
    <p>She says in Man­darin that it was only in March that she took over her Face­book ac­count, which was set up by fans in 2012. The pan­demic pushed her to be ac­tive on­line and to get her fans, who tend to be older folk, to also move on­line.</p>
    <p>“I felt like a rookie... It also felt very strange the first time I per­formed in the stu­dio. With­out a live au­di­ence, there is no in­stant feed­back of ap­plause and smiles,” says Liu, whose getai earn­ings this year are only 30 per cent of last year’s.</p>
    <p>CALL OUT VIEW­ERS’ NAMES, READ COM­MENTS ALOUD</p>
    <p>Getai or­gan­iser Aaron Tan, 44, first put his getai shows on­line four years ago and re­cently tied up with a stu­dio in Jo­hor Baru to live-stream an eight-hour show.</p>
    <p>The founder of Lex(S) En­ter­tain­ment Pro­duc­tions says a ma­jor dif­fer­ence this year is that in­stead of record­ing phys­i­cal shows, the shows are now filmed in­doors, and per­form­ers have to learn new ways to en­gage the on­line au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age in­ter­ac­tion be­tween the per­form­ers and the au­di­ence, Mr Tan uses mon­i­tors to dis­play com­ments and re­ac­tions – such as virtual ap­plause and flower bou­quets – from view­ers dur­ing the live streams.</p>
    <p>He en­cour­ages the per­form­ers to call out the names of view­ers and read the com­ments out loud.</p>
    <p>Getai per­former and host Lee Pei Fen, 33, says per­form­ing on­line, start­ing her Face­book page in March and learn­ing to live-stream chat ses­sions have al­lowed her to build a fan base out­side Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This sev­enth month, she re­ceived flow­ers from a fan in Perth, which were sent to the stu­dio where she was host­ing an on­line show.</p>
    <p>She says: “In the past, once my per­for­mance is over, I could get off the stage and re­lax. Now, getai per­form­ers also have to ‘work from home’ by live-stream­ing ses­sions with fans to en­gage them and pro­mote our­selves.”</p>
    <p>Dur­ing her first live stream, she did not put on much make-up as she was home. When fans com­mented on this, she put on more make-up for sub­se­quent ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Getai fans have also had to adapt. Two years ago, Madam Sophia Lee, 64, l earnt how to use her mo­bile phone to go on­line and to use social me­dia – skills that have proven use­ful now.</p>
    <p>The house­wife says: “The pan­demic re­minds us that we have to keep learn­ing new skills. If you do not keep up with the times, you will find your­self truly iso­lated and dis­con­nected from so­ci­ety.”</p>
