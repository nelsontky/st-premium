    <p>In sus­pend­ing se­nior lawyer Lee Suet Fern for 15 months, a Court of Three Judges found her guilty of mis­con­duct un­be­fit­ting of a lawyer in her han­dling of Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s last will. Here are the court’s other key find­ings:</p>
    <p>• Mrs Lee Suet Fern did not tell the truth in her tes­ti­mony un­der oath to a dis­ci­plinary tri­bunal.</p>
    <p>• She had made false rep­re­sen­ta­tions to Mr Lee Kuan Yew about his will and had sent it with­out check­ing if it was the cor­rect ver­sion.</p>
    <p>• She acted “in com­plete dis­re­gard for the in­ter­ests of Lee Kuan Yew”, and fo­cused on what her hus­band Lee Hsien Yang wanted done, mov­ing to get the will signed “in an un­seemly rush”.</p>
    <p>• Her con­duct was “ob­jec­tion­able”.</p>
    <p>• Mrs Lee was cleared of grossly im­proper con­duct, as there was no im­plied re­tainer and hence no so­lic­i­tor-client re­la­tion­ship be­tween her and Mr Lee Kuan Yew. This was be­cause Mr Lee did not re­gard her as his lawyer.</p>
    <p>• It was Mr Lee Hsien Yang who had been com­mu­ni­cat­ing with Mr Lee Kuan Yew about his will, and he had asked his wife to send his fa­ther the draft last will.</p>
