    <p>While most are won­der­ing when their turn will come, one Sin­ga­porean has al­ready re­ceived his Covid-19 jab in a mass vac­ci­na­tion ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Dr Martin Tan was among the first few to be in­oc­u­lated in Bri­tain – which is the first Western coun­try to roll out mass vac­ci­na­tion against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, 27, re­ceived the first of his two vac­cine jabs yes­ter­day at 12.45pm (8.45pm Sin­ga­pore time) in Lon­don, where he is a house of­fi­cer do­ing his ro­ta­tion in res­pi­ra­tory medicine.</p>
    <p>He re­ceived his vac­cine early – on day two of the ex­er­cise – be­cause his work en­tails di­rect con­tact with Covid-19 pa­tients. He has helped to care for them at the Royal Free Hospi­tal in Hamp­stead in Lon­don since Au­gust.</p>
    <p>He agreed that there are con­cerns over get­ting the vac­cine jab early. Pfizer has ob­tained in­dem­nity from the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment should any mishaps oc­cur.</p>
    <p>“Of course, this is a new vac­cine with a new method of de­liv­ery (mRNA). Most med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers were also scep­ti­cal, about po­ten­tial risks of this be­ing ‘rushed’ be­cause it has been so quick for this to be ap­proved,” Dr Tan said.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, he added: “I work with Covid-19 pa­tients ev­ery day, so it is a bal­ance of risk and ben­e­fit. And I ac­cept the risks, given the ben­e­fits of the vac­cine.”</p>
    <p>He knew he would have to get vac­ci­nated sooner or later, and also had an added in­cen­tive. “I have been look­ing for­ward to it be­cause this is our ticket back to some nor­mal­ity in this world. I am dy­ing to come back to Sin­ga­pore to see my fam­ily and eat.</p>
    <p>“I nor­mally know when I can come back to Sin­ga­pore, but this is the first time things are more un­cer­tain.”</p>
    <p>He has been in Bri­tain since 2014 for his med­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion. His last visit home was in March, when he had to serve a stay-home no­tice fol­lowed by quar­an­tine when some­one sit­ting near him on the flight back was di­ag­nosed with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan, who de­scribed him­self as “still sin­gle, avail­able and ready to min­gle”, re­turned to Lon­don at the end of July to start work there.</p>
    <p>He re­ceived the in­jec­tion – which is free un­der Bri­tain’s Na­tional Health Ser­vice – at the hospi­tal where he works. There is an elec­tronic ap­point­ment sys­tem, he said, so there is no queue or crowds, to en­sure so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­like in Sin­ga­pore, he said, the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Bri­tain is not well con­trolled. “We were hav­ing a sec­ond wave, which is putting a lot of pres­sure on the health ser­vice and on beds in the en­tire coun­try, but it seems to be im­prov­ing now.”</p>
    <p>So, for him, get­ting the vac­cine was a no-brainer. He said: “The risks of get­ting Covid-19 and com­pli­ca­tions from it are sig­nif­i­cantly higher than those from the vac­cine, based on the data pro­duced.”</p>
    <p>I work with Covid-19 pa­tients ev­ery day, so it is a bal­ance of risk and ben­e­fit. And I ac­cept the risks, given the ben­e­fits of the vac­cine.</p>
