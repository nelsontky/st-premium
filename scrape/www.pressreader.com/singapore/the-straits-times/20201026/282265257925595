    <p>Two large Aus­tralian re­new­able en­ergy projects that aim to pro­vide green en­ergy to Sin­ga­pore have reached key mile­stones, tak­ing them a step closer to re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Sun Ca­ble’s Aus­tralia-Asean Power Link near Dar­win hopes to pro­vide up to 20 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s power needs via a gi­ant so­lar farm and a 3,800km sub-sea ca­ble.</p>
    <p>The Asian Re­new­able En­ergy Hub (Areh) in Western Aus­tralia’s Pil­bara re­gion aims to cre­ate green hy­dro­gen and am­mo­nia from the world’s largest power sta­tion pow­ered by the sun and wind.</p>
    <p>The plan is to ship the am­mo­nia, an en­ergy-rich chem­i­cal, to Sin­ga­pore and other mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Both projects are part of a grow­ing vi­sion by de­vel­op­ers and the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment to cap­ture the coun­try’s vast re­new­able en­ergy re­sources to meet Asia’s en­ergy needs, a vi­sion that un­til re­cently was still a dream.</p>
    <p>Fall­ing re­new­able en­ergy costs, im­prove­ments in high-volt­age sub­sea ca­bles and the global shift to­wards low or zero-car­bon en­ergy be­cause of cli­mate change con­cerns are chang­ing the pic­ture.</p>
    <p>Can­berra granted Areh ma­jor project sta­tus last Fri­day. Ear­lier this month, the Western Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment granted en­vi­ron­men­tal ap­proval for the first phase of the project: 15 gi­gawatts (GW) of wind and so­lar, with the even­tual goal of hit­ting 26GW.</p>
    <p>On Oct 19, the North­ern Ter­ri­tory gov­ern­ment an­nounced that Sun Ca­ble’s project had reached the first stage of the en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact as­sess­ment process.</p>
    <p>“It’s a sig­nif­i­cant mile­stone. It’s the for­mal start of the en­vi­ron­men­tal ap­provals process and there’s a lot of work taken to date to get to this point,” Sun Ca­ble chief ex­ec­u­tive David Grif­fin told The Straits Times from Syd­ney. The project is planned to cover 12,000ha, much of that area cov­ered in so­lar ar­rays.</p>
    <p>He sees it as the first of many gi­ant so­lar farms to ex­port power.</p>
    <p>The US$16 bil­lion (S$21.7 bil­lion) de­vel­op­ment has al­ready been granted ma­jor project sta­tus, which means the na­tional gov­ern­ment will help with state and fed­eral ap­provals, as­sist with re­views of pos­si­ble for­eign in­vestors and treat the project as key to na­tional de­vel­op­ment and low-emis­sions plans.</p>
    <p>Both projects are busy lin­ing up cus­tomers in Sin­ga­pore and could start con­struc­tion in the next few years. Both are also the largest of their type glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The US$36 bil­lion Areh, if fully built, would cover 6,500 sq km, or nine times the area of Sin­ga­pore, and in­volve 1,600 wind tur­bines and vast so­lar ar­rays.</p>
    <p>The en­ergy would be used to split water into oxy­gen and flammable hy­dro­gen, which can be used as clean fuel for in­dus­try. It can also be used to cre­ate liq­uid am­mo­nia, which can be used as fuel or to cre­ate low-car­bon fer­tilis­ers.</p>
    <p>The idea is to use hy­dro­gen, which when burned only pro­duces water, and am­mo­nia to re­place nat­u­ral gas and other fos­sil fu­els in in­dus­try, power gen­er­a­tion and trans­port. The ship­ping and power gen­er­a­tion in­dus­tries are al­ready de­vel­op­ing en­gines and tur­bines that can use green am­mo­nia.</p>
    <p>De­spite the project’s size, it is a drop in the bucket of likely fu­ture de­mand for hy­dro­gen as costs fall quickly this decade, said Mr Alex He­witt, founder and di­rec­tor of CWP Re­new­ables, which is part of the Areh con­sor­tium.</p>
    <p>“The age of the big hy­dro­gen hub is upon us,” he told ST. “It all comes back to the elec­tric­ity price. Re­new­ables have come down so much in price. But you need scale.”</p>
    <p>SUB­MA­RINE CA­BLES</p>
    <p>The project in El­liott, 750km south of Dar­win, will have large bat­tery stor­age, with smaller stor­age in Dar­win and Sin­ga­pore. The aim is for dis­patch­able power sup­ply 24 hours a day.</p>
    <p>Mr Grif­fin said the tech­nol­ogy for long-dis­tance high-volt­age di­rect cur­rent sub­ma­rine ca­bles has been proven in Europe, though this will be by far the world’s long­est power ca­ble project and goes through deep waters prone to earthquake­s.</p>
    <p>“The sub-sea sur­vey to un­der­stand ex­actly what is down there is ab­so­lutely crit­i­cal to the de­vel­op­ment of the project. And that sur­vey is un­der way at the mo­ment. We’ve al­ready sur­veyed the first 750km of the route.”</p>
    <p>He said Sun Ca­ble is in dis­cus­sions with com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore and the En­ergy Mar­ket Au­thor­ity (EMA), as well as the In­done­sian gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>An EMA spokesman con­firmed meet­ings with Sun Ca­ble, adding that dis­cus­sions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said that tap­ping re­gional power grids is part of the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment’s strat­egy to fur­ther di­ver­sify en­ergy sup­plies.</p>
    <p>Areh project de­vel­oper An­drew Dick­son said the con­sor­tium has also been talk­ing to dif­fer­ent branches of the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment, with a fo­cus on the pos­si­bil­ity of the is­land be­com­ing a green am­mo­nia bunker­ing hub for the ship­ping in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA) said the agency is study­ing the fea­si­bil­ity of al­ter­na­tive marine fu­els, in­clud­ing car­bon-neu­tral al­ter­na­tives such as hy­dro­gen and am­mo­nia, but noted chal­lenges, in­clud­ing safety con­sid­er­a­tions and tech­no­log­i­cal readi­ness of the fuel stor­age and sup­ply sys­tems.</p>
    <p>He said the MPA and its part­ners have set aside $40 mil­lion un­der the Mar­itime GreenFu­ture Fund for the re­search, test­ing and adop­tion of low-car­bon fu­els and re­lated tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Mr Grif­fin sees im­mense po­ten­tial for a net­work of re­gional green power links.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately, we en­vis­age a net­work ex­tend­ing from In­dia to New Zealand and us­ing the re­new­able en­ergy re­sources where they are most abun­dant along that net­work.</p>
    <p>“So that might be wind and so­lar in In­dia, wind and so­lar in Aus­tralia and hy­dro and wind in NZ and serv­ing all those grow­ing elec­tric­ity mar­kets to Aus­tralia’s north.”</p>
