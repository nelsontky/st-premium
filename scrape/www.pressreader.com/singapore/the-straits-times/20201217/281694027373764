    <p>In an ef­fort to ad­dress the in­creas­ing rate of new Covid-19 in­fec­tions, and with hospi­tal bed oc­cu­pancy al­most at ca­pac­ity, In­done­sia will ban large gath­er­ings dur­ing Christ­mas and New Year’s Eve.</p>
    <p>“Like it or not, no large crowd is al­lowed. I ask all provin­cial gov­er­nors to make sure there is no New Year’s Eve crowd,” said Co­or­di­nat­ing Mar­itime Af­fairs and In­vest­ment Min­is­ter Luhut Pand­jai­tan.</p>
    <p>In the record­ing of a vir­tual meet­ing on Tues­day shared by Mr Luhut’s press of­fice with the me­dia, the min­is­ter, a close aide of Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo, said: “Christ­mas in churches could be lim­ited to, say, 50 peo­ple, to keep enough dis­tance...</p>
    <p>“If we do not tighten up re­stric­tions, cases will con­tinue to in­crease and it will get very bad.”</p>
    <p>Mr Luhut is lead­ing ef­forts to curb the virus’ spread in the prov­inces with the high­est caseloads.</p>
    <p>The world’s fourth most pop­u­lous na­tion added 6,937 new coro­n­avirus cases be­tween Dec 2 and Dec 8, and 7,780 the week af­ter that. By com­par­i­son, the weekly caseload be­tween mid-Septem­ber and mid-Novem­ber was from 2,700 to 4,500, ac­cord­ing to data shown dur­ing the vir­tual meet­ing.</p>
    <p>In the past week, 95 peo­ple re­port­edly died of Covid-19, com­pared with 55 in the week be­fore last, and 50 be­tween Nov 25 and Dec 1.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 83 of the 98 re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals in Jakarta treat­ing Covid-19 pa­tients re­ported that, as at Mon­day, oc­cu­pancy in their iso­la­tion wards had ex­ceeded two-thirds of the to­tal ca­pac­ity, while 62 of them were more than 80 per cent full.</p>
    <p>Nine­teen re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals re­ported full oc­cu­pancy.</p>
    <p>This is ac­cord­ing to the lat­est gov­ern­ment data ob­tained by The Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of new deaths in­creased (in prov­inces with many Covid-19 cases) af­ter a pre­vi­ously ob­served down­ward trend,” Mr Luhut said, at­tribut­ing the swing to a re­cent five-day week­end.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Jakarta, prov­inces with high caseloads and in­creas­ing fa­tal­i­ties in­clude West Java, East Java, South Su­lawesi and North Su­ma­tra.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia had a five-day week­end be­tween Oct 28 and Nov 1.</p>
    <p>Many Jakar­tans and res­i­dents of other ma­jor cities went on hol­i­day or to visit fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>This was de­spite pleas by the author­i­ties for peo­ple to stay home.</p>
    <p>A mass event also took place in Jakarta on Nov 14, with thou­sands of mostly mask­less sup­port­ers of Rizieq Shi­hab, the de­tained leader of vig­i­lante group Islamic De­fend­ers Front, gath­er­ing in Tanah Abang to osten­si­bly at­tend the wed­ding of his daugh­ter and at the same time com­mem­o­rate Prophet Muham­mad’s birth­day.</p>
    <p>Start­ing later this week, 75 per cent of the work­force in the Greater Jakarta area – which in­cludes satel­lite towns Bo­gor, De­pok, Tangerang and Bekasi – will have to work from home, up from the cur­rent 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>The ex­act date this will take ef­fect has been left to the provin­cial gov­er­nors.</p>
    <p>The op­er­at­ing hours of shop­ping malls, restau­rants and en­ter­tain­ment cen­tres in the area will also be fur­ther short­ened, with a re­quire­ment for these to close at 7pm at the lat­est.</p>
