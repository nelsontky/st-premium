    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s cam­paign web­site was briefly taken over by hack­ers who de­faced the site.</p>
    <p>The de­face­ment lasted less than 30 min­utes on Tues­day, but the in­ci­dent came as Mr Trump’s cam­paign and that of his op­po­nent, Mr Joe Bi­den, as well as law en­force­ment and in­tel­li­gence agen­cies, were on high alert for dig­i­tal in­ter­fer­ence ahead of next week’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Tim Mur­taugh, a Trump cam­paign spokesman, con­firmed the web­site’s de­face­ment and said it was “work­ing with the law en­force­ment au­thor­i­ties to in­ves­ti­gate the source of the at­tack”.</p>
    <p>He added: “There was no ex­po­sure to sen­si­tive data be­cause none of it is ac­tu­ally stored on the site. The web­site has been re­stored.”</p>
    <p>It was not clear whether the de­face­ment was the work of for­eign hack­ers or cy­ber crim­i­nals. But in a screed posted to Mr Trump’s web­site – don­ald­jtrump.com – the hack­ers claimed to have com­pro­mised “mul­ti­ple de­vices” that gave them ac­cess to the “most in­ter­nal and se­cret con­ver­sa­tions” of the Pres­i­dent and his rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>The hack­ers also ac­cused the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of hav­ing a hand in the ori­gins of the coro­n­avirus and co­op­er­at­ing with “for­eign ac­tors ma­nip­u­lat­ing the 2020 elec­tions”.</p>
    <p>They ap­peared to be look­ing to gen­er­ate cryp­tocur­rency. They in­vited vis­i­tors to do­nate cryp­tocur­rency to one of two funds – one la­belled “Yes, share the data” and the other la­belled “No, Do not share the data”.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the dead­line, we will com­pare the funds and ex­e­cute the will of the world,” they wrote.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­perts said the in­ci­dent could have been caused by trick­ing a web­site ad­min­is­tra­tor into turn­ing over the cre­den­tials, or by redi­rect­ing the cam­paign web­site to the hacker’s own server.</p>
    <p>In­tel­li­gence agen­cies have been closely mon­i­tor­ing hack­ing groups, in­clud­ing teams backed by Iran and Rus­sia, that have tried to break into elec­tion-re­lated sys­tems and have been in­volved in in­flu­ence op­er­a­tions in re­cent weeks.</p>
