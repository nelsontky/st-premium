    <p>Lo­cal shares were pushed into pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory yes­ter­day fol­low­ing a sur­pris­ing set of in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion fig­ures that eased wor­ries about a pro­longed eco­nomic weak­ness set­ting in.</p>
    <p>The bet­ter-than-ex­pected num­bers from the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor helped lift the bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) 0.88 per cent, or 21.46 points, to 2,472.28.</p>
    <p>Gain­ers out­paced losers 231 to 192, with 1.25 bil­lion shares worth $890.48 mil­lion chang­ing hands.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Ex­change mar­ket strate­gist Ge­off Howie said the morn­ing mo­men­tum came from re­newed hopes for more fis­cal stim­u­lus from the United States ahead of its Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>While Europe opened weaker, whit­tling away that im­pact in the af­ter­noon, key Sin­ga­pore shares were able to hold much of their ground, thanks to those in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion num­bers that “blew ex­pec­ta­tions out of the wa­ter”, he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s fac­tory out­put soared 13.7 per cent year on year last month, led by strong growth in elec­tron­ics.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan noted: “Per­ceived risks aris­ing from the Covid-19 pan­demic ap­pear to have greatly di­min­ished at this junc­ture, ow­ing to the sharp fall in in­fec­tion rates in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Among STI con­stituents, Dairy Farm In­ter­na­tional and Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust were the best-per­form­ing coun­ters. Dairy Farm rose 1.5 per cent to US$3.96; Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust edged up 1.5 per cent to $1.99.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sing­tel con­tin­ued to see heavy trad­ing with over 23 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands as the stock climbed 0.9 per cent to $2.14.</p>
    <p>Other ac­tive coun­ters in­cluded Thai Bev­er­age, which closed flat at 58.5 cents. CGS-CIMB up­graded the bev­er­age gi­ant to “add” from “hold” on Thurs­day and kept the tar­get price at 70 cents.</p>
    <p>Only two STI stocks ended the day in the red. SGX shed 0.4 per cent to $9.00 and Sats fell 0.4 per cent to $2.77.</p>
    <p>Else­where in Asia, sev­eral re­gional bench­marks ended higher.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Kospi closed up 0.27 per cent, re­bound­ing from a near two-month low on Thurs­day. Ja­pan rose 0.51 per cent. Malaysia climbed 0.56 per cent.</p>
    <p>The Hang Seng In­dex bucked the trend, fall­ing 0.32 per cent as fears of ris­ing coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and reim­po­si­tion of con­tain­ment mea­sures con­tinue to weigh on traders. China’s bench­mark Shanghai Com­pos­ite In­dex dropped 0.12 per cent.</p>
    <p>A surge among Aus­tralian banks on news that lend­ing rules would be eased helped the ASX in Syd­ney to add 1.51 per cent, al­low­ing it to end the week 1.7 per cent ahead.</p>
