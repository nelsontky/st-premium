    <p>• Tot­ten­ham man­ager Jose Mour­inho ad­mon­ished his play­ers after los­ing an­other lead, this time to Wolver­hamp­ton Wanderers in Sun­day’s 1-1 draw, to con­tinue a poor run that has seen them slip from first to fifth in the Premier League in three weeks.</p>
    <p>With six points be­tween them and lead­ers Liverpool (32), they re­main in the ti­tle hunt but Mour­inho was con­cerned at the lack of am­bi­tion shown at Mo­lineux, with Spurs seem­ingly con­tent to sit on their lead.</p>
    <p>“It is dis­ap­point­ing, of course,” the Por­tuguese man­ager said after Ro­main Saiss’ l ate header can­celled out Tan­guy Ndombele’s opener just 57 sec­onds in.</p>
    <p>“We had con­trol of the game. But we had 89 min­utes to score more goals, and we didn’t. And it was not just about not scor­ing goals, it was also about not be­ing dangerous, not be­ing am­bi­tious, and for me, that’s the prob­lem.”</p>
    <p>Spurs sat back in the sec­ond half, giv­ing Wolves space to press for an equaliser, in a re­peat of an­other 1-1 away draw ear­lier this month at Crys­tal Palace.</p>
    <p>The vis­i­tors could not call upon Gareth Bale, after he suf­fered a calf in­jury in mid­week that is set to keep him out for a few weeks.</p>
    <p>A win would have put Mour­inho’s men third and they have now dropped more points in the last 10 min­utes of matches this sea­son than any other side in the league.</p>
    <p>For a team who have not won a tro­phy since the 2008 League Cup and the league since 1961, Spurs’ lack of ini­tia­tive in­fu­ri­ated Mour­inho.</p>
    <p>“Of course, to­mor­row we are go­ing to have a sim­i­lar meet­ing as other meet­ings we have had,” he said. “And of course after to­mor­row, we are go­ing to prac­tise the same thing we have prac­tised after sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tions...</p>
    <p>“Of course, it (con­ced­ing late goals) is a con­cern, but I re­peat, it is more of a con­cern the fact that we score early goals and we don’t do matches.”</p>
    <p>In con­trast to Spurs, Wolves have been come­back spe­cial­ists un­der man­ager Nuno Espir­ito Santo, who was a goal­keeper un­der Mour­inho at Porto.</p>
    <p>On their knack of scor­ing late – they have grabbed a goal in the clos­ing min­utes in the last three games – the Wolves boss said: “It has not only to do with fit­ness, it has to do with be­lief, with the spirit of the boys. The ef­fort was huge... It re­quired a big heart.”</p>
    <p>With­out Raul Jimenez, their top scorer who is out in­def­i­nitely after frac­tur­ing his skull against Ar­se­nal last month, the team have slipped into the bot­tom half. But Nuno re­vealed they are “pre­par­ing” to move for a striker when the win­dow opens next month.</p>
