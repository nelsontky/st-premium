    <p>Af­ter lead­ing his side to a 1-0 win at Hougang United yes­ter­day to seal Al­birex Ni­igata’s fourth Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) ti­tle in five sea­sons, skip­per Kazuki Hash­ioka could not stop look­ing at his win­ner’s medal with a wide grin.</p>
    <p>His younger brother Daiki may play for the more il­lus­tri­ous Urawa Red Di­a­monds in the J.League and fea­tured in last sea­son’s AFC Cham­pi­ons League fi­nal, but Kazuki can now boast of be­ing the first in the Hash­ioka fam­ily to win a ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old laughed as he told The Sun­day Times: “I will def­i­nitely call him later to show off my medal. We are both right-backs and such friendly com­pe­ti­tion mo­ti­vates us both.”</p>
    <p>The White Swans have def­i­nitely been a fam­ily on the field this sea­son, show­ing im­pres­sive team­work to over­come a per­ceived lack of in­di­vid­ual bril­liance to run out SPL cham­pi­ons and win­ners of the $150,000 prize money.</p>
    <p>In the last 45 days of a coro­n­avirus-dis­rupted sea­son, they have been the most con­sis­tent team. Other than two de­feats by</p>
    <p>run­ners-up Tampines Rovers, they al­ways found a way to win the other nine games af­ter the restart, while their ti­tle ri­vals fal­tered.</p>
    <p>When striker Reo Nishiguchi was out with an an­kle in­jury af­ter scor­ing in each of his first five games, To­moyuki Doi stepped up to con­trib­ute 11 goals. They were not short of lead­ers – when the chips are down, Hash­ioka ma­rauded for­ward and he was the one who supplied the late match­win­ning as­sists in the two cru­cial 3-2 wins over Lion City Sailors.</p>
    <p>Their su­pe­rior fit­ness dur­ing a packed sched­ule also played a big part in their suc­cess. In the past month, they were held goal­less at the break by Hougang, Balestier and Tan­jong Pa­gar, but each time</p>
    <p>they just stepped up a gear in the se­cond half to win 4-0, 2-0 and 3-0 re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Al­birex coach Keiji Shige­tomi said: “We worked very hard for this ti­tle, es­pe­cially on our fit­ness dur­ing the coro­n­avirus sus­pen­sion. We ran 5km three times a week, and in­creased that to 7km. Be­ing fit helps us not to lose con­cen­tra­tion late in the game, and gives us an edge when we are try­ing to score.”</p>
    <p>It was the same story yes­ter­day – latch­ing onto a missed clear­ance by Nazrul Nazari, Doi set up Ry­oya Taniguchi to fin­ish clin­i­cally be­yond Rid­huan Barudin in the 53rd minute. The goal sent the group of about 20 Al­birex fans and cheer­lead­ers out­side Hougang Sta­dium wild with delir­ium.</p>
    <p>And when Al­birex take the lead, they usu­ally hang on to it. De­spite news of Tampines equal­is­ing against Gey­lang in the last 10 min­utes, and the prospect of late drama emerg­ing – an­other goal from the Stags and Hougang would see the tro­phy des­ti­na­tion switched – Al­birex re­mained un­flap­pable.</p>
    <p>In any case, no team other than Tampines and the Sailors have man­aged to breach their goal af­ter the restart.</p>
    <p>They rode their luck as well, es­pe­cially in their first 3-2 win over the Sailors, in which they threw away a 2-0 lead, but won in added time af­ter Hash­ioka’s hand­ball went un­pun­ished in the build-up.</p>
    <p>In their penul­ti­mate game, Tan­jong Pa­gar were also un­lucky to have a late equaliser ruled out for off­side be­fore Al­birex sealed a 3-0 win.</p>
    <p>Yet few could be­grudge the cham­pi­ons af­ter they fig­ured out how to as­sim­i­late lo­cal play­ers into their pre­dom­i­nantly Ja­panese ros­ter.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans Fairoz Hasan, Gareth Low, Iman Hakim and Ong Yu En all con­trib­uted in mid­field and at­tack through­out the sea­son.</p>
    <p>Mid­fielder Fairoz said: “The lo­cal play­ers can def­i­nitely learn from the Ja­panese play­ers. They have great dis­ci­pline, fit­ness and a never-say-die at­ti­tude. I’m for­tu­nate to be able to play in this team and ex­pe­ri­ence this cul­ture.”</p>
