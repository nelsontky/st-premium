    <p>WHERE 01-01, 354 Joo Chiat Road OPEN 3pm to 1am daily TEL 6366-9985</p>
    <p>This is lit­er­ally road­side din­ing, as most of the ta­bles are lined up along Mar­shall Lane, with a few more along Joo Chiat Road. En­joy the laid-back at­mos­phere, rem­i­nis­cent of din­ing in Malaysia.</p>
    <p>The stall is run by head chef Lim Chew Beng, 45, and his wife Mandy Loh, 41. Chef Lim, who is from Seremban, Malaysia, came to Sin­ga­pore at age 20 and started his stall in Wood­lands in 2002. It moved to its cur­rent lo­ca­tion in 2007.</p>
    <p>Prices are mod­est at the stall, which also scores for pre­sen­ta­tion, us­ing real flow­ers to ac­cent dishes like its house­made Crispy Prawn Roll ($12 for small, $18 for medium, $24 for large).</p>
    <p>The prawn rolls con­tain chunky pieces of prawn, pork, so­tong paste and water chest­nuts, which give a bouncy tex­ture.</p>
    <p>The best dish here is the XO Fried Vegetable ($10 for small, $14 for medium, $18 for large).</p>
    <p>Pieces of brin­jal, lady’s fin­ger and long beans are dipped in bat­ter and fried. Mermaid fish lends crisp­ness to the dish, while petai beans add crunch.</p>
    <p>The veg­eta­bles are tossed in a house­made spicy XO sauce that con­tains dried scal­lop.</p>
    <p>The dish does not taste oily and could be just the thing to win over those who hate eat­ing greens.</p>
    <p>The Curry Fish Head ($24 for small, $30 for medium) of­fers value for money with its fresh and sweet-tast­ing ang zhor fish head, in­stead of the usual angkoli.</p>
    <p>The joint also serves a re­spectable ver­sion of KL Hokkien Mee ($6 for small ,$10 for medium), known as tai lok meen in Can­tonese. Much of the aroma and flavour comes from the use of pork lard that is fried in-house.</p>
    <p>In­stead of us­ing udon noo­dles, the stall uses thick noo­dles with square edges, which are tra­di­tion­ally used in tai lok meen.</p>
    <p>Ask for more pork lard as a top­ping or on the side, as those in the noo­dles get soggy.</p>
