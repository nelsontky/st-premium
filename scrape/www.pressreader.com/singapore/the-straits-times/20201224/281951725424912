    <p>Iam glad that the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) seeks to equip stu­dents with “the nec­es­sary so­cial and emo­tional skills to de­velop pos­i­tive self-iden­tity, main­tain healthy re­la­tion­ships and make in­formed and re­spon­si­ble de­ci­sions on sex­u­al­ity mat­ters” (Sex­u­al­ity ed­u­ca­tion: Stu­dents taught from young age to treat oth­ers with re­spect, Dec 22).</p>
    <p>I am fur­ther en­cour­aged by MOE’s ac­knowl­edge­ment that “be­sides schools, par­ents also play a key role in nur­tur­ing our young”.</p>
    <p>Par­ents are an in­te­gral, in­deed in­dis­pens­able, part of a child’s jour­ney from the very be­gin­ning.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies and ex­pe­ri­ence have con­sis­tently shown that, where par­ents are ac­tively and pos­i­tively in­volved in their chil­dren’s lives, and nurture healthy par­ent-child bond­ing, the chil­dren not only per­form bet­ter aca­dem­i­cally, but more im­por­tantly, are also more likely to ac­quire pos­i­tive val­ues of love and re­spect for oth­ers as they grow older and in­te­grate more fully into so­ci­ety. This is re­gard­less of their so­cio-eco­nomic sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>When par­ents af­firm their chil­dren’s self-worth, and make them feel val­ued for who they are in­stead of merely what they can achieve, the pos­i­tive self-im­age they de­velop will make them less likely to en­gage in risky be­hav­iours (such as drugs, al­co­holism, ca­sual sex) and more likely to make de­ci­sions that yield bet­ter long-term out­comes in life.</p>
    <p>As pri­mary ed­u­ca­tors of their chil­dren, par­ents should be en­gaged as ma­jor part­ners in their chil­dren’s sex­u­al­ity ed­u­ca­tion and holis­tic devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>They are the ones who spend the most time with them, and thus are most able to im­part pos­i­tive val­ues through daily con­ver­sa­tions and by be­ing role mod­els.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine the im­pact on a child when he sees how his par­ents love and re­spect each other at home, with both help­ing with the house­work and child­care re­spon­si­bil­i­ties to the best that each can give.</p>
    <p>And again, imag­ine the im­pact on a child when he sees how his father re­gards women in gen­eral, as per­sons equal in dig­nity, fully de­serv­ing of re­spect and love, and not as ob­jects to be used.</p>
    <p>Be­sides par­ents, MOE may want to rope in other stake­hold­ers in an in­te­grated and co­or­di­nated way, such as the Early Child­hood Devel­op­ment Agency, to tap its wealth of knowl­edge and ex­per­tise in early child devel­op­ment and parenting. Hui Keem Peng John (Dr)</p>
    <p>Par­ents are an in­te­gral, in­deed in­dis­pens­able, part of a child’s jour­ney from the very be­gin­ning.</p>
