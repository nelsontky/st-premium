    <p>Riot po­lice fir­ing wa­ter can­non that re­port­edly con­tained sting­ing chem­i­cals at pro­test­ers in Bangkok last night, in the most vi­o­lent es­ca­la­tion of three months of demon­stra­tions against the Thai gov­ern­ment and monar­chy. Pro­test­ers, de­fy­ing a gov­ern­ment ban on gath­er­ings for a sec­ond day, pushed back against hel­meted po­lice who ad­vanced with ba­tons and riot shields.</p>
    <p>Calls have built up among pro­test­ers for re­forms to the monar­chy, which they ac­cuse of help­ing to en­trench decades of mil­i­tary in­flu­ence in pol­i­tics. In comments recorded a day ear­lier and aired by state tele­vi­sion yes­ter­day, King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn said Thai­land</p>
    <p>“needs peo­ple who love the coun­try and love the monar­chy”, though he did not di­rectly com­ment on the protests.</p>
    <p>Thai po­lice used wa­ter can­non and pushed for­ward with riot shields and ba­tons yes­ter­day to try to dis­perse thou­sands of pro­test­ers in the cap­i­tal who de­fied a ban on protests for a sec­ond day and in spite of a warn­ing from Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers ral­lied at the main in­ter­sec­tion near the MBK Cen­ter shop­ping mall in cen­tral Bangkok and pushed back against po­lice, wield­ing um­brel­las and throw­ing plas­tic bot­tles. “Get out, get out,” the pro­test­ers chanted as po­lice used the heav­i­est force yet to stop three months of protests that have chal­lenged King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s monar­chy as well as de­manded the re­moval of Mr Prayut, a for­mer mil­i­tary ruler.</p>
    <p>“The dic­ta­to­rial gov­ern­ment is us­ing vi­o­lence to dis­perse the peo­ple’s move­ment,” said Mr Tat­tep Ruang­pra­paik­it­seree, one of the protest lead­ers.</p>
    <p>An emer­gency rul­ing ban­ning gath­er­ings of more than four peo­ple was im­posed on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“We’ve is­sued warn­ings against il­le­gal acts,” said po­lice spokesman Yingyot Thep­cham­nong. “Af­ter this, there will be in­ten­sive mea­sures in en­forc­ing the law.”</p>
    <p>A protest sign read “Re­lease our friends” – a ref­er­ence to the ar­rest of more than 40 pro­test­ers, in­clud­ing sev­eral of their lead­ers, as a gov­ern­ment crack­down has in­ten­si­fied this week.</p>
    <p>“I have to fight for my fu­ture,” said Ms Pin, 22, a uni­ver­sity stu­dent at the protest who de­clined to give her full name for fear of reprisals.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers dis­persed later at night, with one or­gan­iser send­ing out the mes­sage, “End of protest”.</p>
    <p>Mr Prayut first took power as army chief in a 2014 coup. Crit­ics say he en­gi­neered a gen­eral elec­tion last year to keep hold of power as a civil­ian prime min­is­ter. Pro­test­ers also want a new Con­sti­tu­tion to re­place one drafted un­der mil­i­tary rule.</p>
    <p>“I’m not quit­ting,” Mr Prayut told re­porters af­ter an emer­gency Cab­i­net meeting. “The gov­ern­ment must use the emer­gency de­cree. We have to pro­ceed be­cause the sit­u­a­tion be­came vi­o­lent... It is be­ing used for 30 days, or less if the sit­u­a­tion eases.”</p>
    <p>He warned peo­ple not to vi­o­late the emer­gency mea­sures, say­ing: “Just wait and see... If you do wrong, we will use the law.”</p>
    <p>Calls have built up among pro­test­ers for re­forms to the monar­chy, which they ac­cuse of help­ing to en­trench decades of mil­i­tary in­flu­ence in pol­i­tics. Protests have been largely peace­ful. The only spe­cific in­ci­dent cited by the gov­ern­ment for the im­po­si­tion of emer­gency mea­sures was one in which Queen Suthida’s mo­tor­cade was jeered by pro­test­ers, but it also said the protests were damaging the econ­omy and na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Two men will be charged with at­tempted vi­o­lence against the Queen, which car­ries a pos­si­ble death sen­tence if her life is thought to have been threat­ened. Even if the death penalty is not im­posed, the charge can mean life in jail.</p>
    <p>In pre-recorded comments from an event a day ear­lier that were broad­cast on tele­vi­sion yes­ter­day, King Va­ji­ra­longkorn said “the coun­try needs peo­ple who love the coun­try and love the monar­chy”.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing a group of for­mer com­mu­nists, he said: “All your ex­pe­ri­ence and the things that you’ve done – you can teach the new gen­er­a­tion of your ex­pe­ri­ence. This will be greatly use­ful.”</p>
