    <p>Australia is stand­ing up to China. Watch closely: It may be a har­bin­ger of things to come, as the world’s smaller coun­tries re­spond to the in­creas­ingly co­er­cive Asian eco­nomic su­per­power.</p>
    <p>For years, the Aus­tralian po­lit­i­cal and busi­ness es­tab­lish­ment had a para­mount goal: pro­tect and ex­pand this nat­u­ral re­source pow­er­house’s boom­ing ex­ports to fast­grow­ing China. Iron ore, coal, nat­u­ral gas, wine and more: Un­til Covid-19 struck, Australia had a 29-year run with­out a sin­gle re­ces­sion as it sent its sig­na­ture goods to the world’s vo­ra­cious No. 2 econ­omy. Can­berra’s diplo­macy came to fo­cus on balanc­ing the Chi­nese trade re­la­tion­ship with the na­tion’s equally im­por­tant de­fence al­liance with the United States.</p>
    <p>But the par­a­digm through which the govern­ment of Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son now views China has shifted dra­mat­i­cally, peo­ple inside his govern­ment told Reuters. The re­la­tion­ship is no longer shaped just by trade, but by a stark view emerging widely inside this con­ti­nent-span­ning coun­try – that Bei­jing poses a threat to Australia’s democ­racy and sovereignt­y.</p>
    <p>Re­cent steps taken by the Prime Min­is­ter ap­pear to re­flect this think­ing. He has warned the Aus­tralian pub­lic about a sig­nif­i­cant in­crease in cy­ber at­tacks, in­tro­duced a na­tional se­cu­rity test for for­eign in­vest­ments, and an­nounced a dra­matic jump in de­fence spend­ing fo­cused on the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mr Mor­ri­son didn’t name China when an­nounc­ing these moves, but govern­ment of­fi­cials said they came in re­sponse to Bei­jing’s ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Australia has also voiced con­cerns in re­cent weeks about what it sees as Chi­nese dis­in­for­ma­tion cam­paigns that seek to un­der­mine democ­ra­cies, sus­pended its extraditio­n treaty with Hong Kong over China’s im­po­si­tion of a dra­co­nian se­cu­rity law in the city, and filed a dec­la­ra­tion with the United Na­tions re­ject­ing China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Of all the ac­tions taken by Australia in re­cent months, though, it’s the govern­ment’s lob­by­ing of world lead­ers in April for an in­quiry into the ori­gins of the Covid-19 pan­demic that has most en­raged Bei­jing. The world lined up be­hind the move, with 137 na­tions co-spon­sor­ing a res­o­lu­tion at the World Health Assem­bly for an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the pan­demic, which first emerged in Wuhan. Bei­jing also ul­ti­mately backed the res­o­lu­tion. An in­de­pen­dent panel, headed by for­mer New Zealand prime min­is­ter He­len Clark and for­mer Liberian pres­i­dent Ellen John­son Sir­leaf, will de­liver an in­terim re­port in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing lashed out an­grily, im­pos­ing trade sanc­tions on Australia af­ter the pan­demic in­quiry move. It sus­pended some beef im­ports on a tech­ni­cal­ity and ef­fec­tively blocked a US$439 mil­lion (S$600 mil­lion) trade in bar­ley by slap­ping tar­iffs of 80.5 per cent on the Aus­tralian im­port. China has also launched an anti-dump­ing probe into Aus­tralian wine im­ports.</p>
    <p>Last month, a Chi­nese diplo­mat drew on Ro­man his­tory to blast Can­berra, com­par­ing Australia’s call for an in­quiry to the be­trayal of Julius Cae­sar by the as­sas­sin Bru­tus.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry said Bei­jing had never in­ter­fered in Australia or used co­er­cion against it. Re­spond­ing to ques­tions from Reuters, the min­istry also called on Australia to “aban­don the Cold War men­tal­ity”, do more to “en­hance mu­tual trust” and not “pro­voke trou­ble on is­sues in­volv­ing China’s core in­ter­ests”. A sta­ble re­la­tion­ship, it said, was in the in­ter­ests of both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Reuters spoke to 19 cur­rent and for­mer Aus­tralian govern­ment of­fi­cials and two for­mer prime min­is­ters in ex­am­in­ing how re­la­tions with China have de­te­ri­o­rated. They pro­vided the first com­pre­hen­sive ac­count of how the govern­ment came to adopt its view that Australia must “speak up”, as sev­eral min­is­ters have said, about Bei­jing’s ac­tions.</p>
    <p>This shift in Australia’s po­si­tion on China be­gan in 2017, the in­ter­views show, be­fore the sharp de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in re­la­tions be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton, which threat­ens to trig­ger a new Cold War. The change has been led in part by a co­terie of Aus­tralian of­fi­cials, some with se­cu­rity and in­tel­li­gence back­grounds, who hold deeply scep­ti­cal views of the Chi­nese lead­er­ship and its global am­bi­tions.</p>
    <p>In one sign of the times, a bi­par­ti­san group of anti-China hawks has formed in the Aus­tralian Par­lia­ment, who dub them­selves “the Wolver­ines”. Asked about this shift, Mr Mor­ri­son couched his moves with di­plo­matic care. In a writ­ten re­sponse, he said his govern­ment’s ap­proach to China has been con­sis­tent.</p>
    <p>“As with any bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship, Australia’s ap­proach is based on our val­ues and prin­ci­ples, and on a clear-eyed as­sess­ment of Australia’s na­tional in­ter­est,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>“We place great store on our re­la­tion­ship with China and we have not sought to put that re­la­tion­ship at risk.”</p>
    <p>Australia had been a great ben­e­fi­ciary of China’s eco­nomic growth, Mr Mor­ri­son said, but “as coun­tries de­velop they have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to up­hold a sta­ble, pros­per­ous strate­gic bal­ance in our re­gion”.</p>
    <p>Trade with China re­mains vi­tally im­por­tant to Australia. The stakes are high: Australia has a US$172 bil­lion trad­ing re­la­tion­ship with China, and a US$51 bil­lion sur­plus.</p>
    <p>It’s an un­easy balanc­ing act. In re­sponse to Australia’s push for a pan­demic in­quiry, Bei­jing ac­cused Can­berra of “danc­ing to the tune” of Wash­ing­ton. In June, af­ter a fresh threat from Bei­jing on trade, Mr Mor­ri­son said Australia wouldn’t yield to “co­er­cion”. A visit Mr Mor­ri­son paid to Bei­jing in 2017, when he was Trea­surer, set the stage for his stance in the cur­rent feud. He came away from the trip con­vinced his coun­try’s trade with the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy had two-way ben­e­fit. He’d heard from Chi­nese of­fi­cials, he told a small group of re­porters in Bei­jing at the time, that Australia’s ex­ports of i ron ore, which the coun­try pro­duces in vast vol­umes and high qual­ity, put it in a “unique po­si­tion”. This con­vic­tion, that China needs Australia’s iron ore, is now but­tress­ing his govern­ment’s po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“It is a mu­tu­ally ben­e­fi­cial re­la­tion­ship,” Mr Mor­ri­son said in his com­ments to Reuters. “China’s econ­omy is stronger be­cause they have ac­cess to high-qual­ity en­ergy, re­sources, agri­cul­tural goods and in­creas­ingly ser­vices from Australia. And our econ­omy is stronger be­cause we have ac­cess to high-qual­ity man­u­fac­tured goods from China.” So far, China hasn’t men­tioned iron ore as a po­ten­tial tar­get for reprisal. For good rea­son: Australia makes up 60 per cent of China’s im­ports of iron ore, cru­cial for pow­er­ing an econ­omy Bei­jing is try­ing to get back to full ca­pac­ity af­ter it was shut­tered by the virus.</p>
    <p>De­spite China’s “blus­ter”, it needs Australia, says for­mer prime min­is­ter Malcolm Turn­bull, whose re­la­tion­ship with Bei­jing be­came in­creas­ingly icy dur­ing his ten­ure from 2015 to 2018.</p>
    <p>“If China sud­denly came across a huge sup­ply of iron ore, at ap­pro­pri­ate grades, that they could ex­tract at com­pet­i­tive prices, that was closer to them, they would be all over it – but there’s not,” he said. “Chi­nese com­pa­nies do not buy Aus­tralian com­modi­ties, goods or ser­vices be­cause they want to do this strug­gling lit­tle i sland na­tion a favour – they do it be­cause it’s good value, good qual­ity.”</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen whether Australia’s tougher stance pro­vides a broader model for other mid­sized pow­ers re­liant on ex­ports to China. Australia’s iron ore would be hard for China to re­place; other na­tions may lack such lever­age.</p>
    <p>One for­mer Aus­tralian leader, while sup­port­ing a firm po­si­tion on China, ques­tions the govern­ment’s han­dling of the re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>For­mer La­bor prime min­is­ter Kevin Rudd said China is dif­fi­cult to deal with and re­spects strength, but he is crit­i­cal of the Mor­ri­son govern­ment’s “rolling crises” with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Be­ing “hairy chested on China” has be­come a com­pe­ti­tion for ad­vance­ment in Mr Mor­ri­son’s Lib­eral Party, Mr Rudd said. “China is never go­ing to im­pose any eco­nomic mea­sures against Australia which dam­age its own in­ter­ests,” added Mr Rudd, a flu­ent Man­darin speaker and for­mer diplo­mat in the Bei­jing em­bassy. But, he adds, Australia has vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties: Aus­tralian ex­ports be­yond iron ore that aren’t es­sen­tial to China could be tar­geted by Bei­jing, quickly adding up to an ex­pen­sive toll.</p>
    <p>SOURED SEN­TI­MENT</p>
    <p>When the pan­demic hit, Australia had al­ready de­cided it was deal­ing with a more au­thor­i­tar­ian and assertive Chi­nese govern­ment un­der Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, and in the long term needed to re­duce its trade re­liance on Bei­jing, di­plo­mats and govern­ment of­fi­cials told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic, how­ever, brought ten­sions into the open like never be­fore. In pre­vi­ous bouts of fric­tion, too, Bei­jing took puni­tive eco­nomic mea­sures against Australia. But those penal­ties, such as hold­ing up coal ship­ments or wine at its ports, were cloaked as Cus­toms tech­ni­cal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This time, China’s ambassador to Can­berra, Mr Cheng Jingye, was un­equiv­o­cal, threat­en­ing in an April 27 news­pa­per in­ter­view that in re­sponse to Australia’s call for an in­quiry, the Chi­nese pub­lic could boycott Aus­tralian wine, beef and tourism.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing then cau­tioned its stu­dents against choos­ing Aus­tralian uni­ver­si­ties, threat­en­ing a US$27.5 bil­lion mar­ket for ed­u­cat­ing for­eign stu­dents. Mr Mor­ri­son fired back with his strong­est lan­guage on China since be­com­ing prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“We are an open-trad­ing na­tion, mate, but I’m never go­ing to trade our val­ues in re­sponse to co­er­cion from wher­ever it comes,” he told Syd­ney ra­dio sta­tion 2GB in June.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic sen­ti­ment to­wards China has soured. An an­nual poll by the Lowy In­sti­tute, a for­eign pol­icy re­search group, found that trust in China among Aus­tralians had plum­meted to 23 per cent, com­pared with 52 per cent in 2018. The sur­vey, re­leased in June, found that 94 per cent of re­spon­dents sup­ported re­duc­ing eco­nomic re­liance on China.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment’s ap­proach of work­ing with other na­tions in the re­gion to deal with China en­joys bi­par­ti­san sup­port. “In our re­la­tion­ship with China, as with any coun­try, we must al­ways as­sert our val­ues and our in­ter­ests – in­clud­ing trans­parency and sovereignt­y,” the op­po­si­tion La­bor Party’s for­eign af­fairs spokesman, Se­na­tor Penny Wong, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>The United States is Australia’s ma­jor se­cu­rity ally. But with the elec­tion of Mr Don­ald Trump on an “Amer­ica First” plat­form, the of­fi­cials who have pushed a tougher line on China have also called for Australia to be­gin seek­ing wider al­liances with so-called mid­dle pow­ers – coun­tries like Ja­pan, In­dia and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“Amer­ica un­der Trump is be­ing seen as er­ratic, less re­li­able, and he has the habit of turn­ing on al­lies from time to time,” said Mr Turn­bull, who en­dured a tense call with</p>
    <p>Mr Trump af­ter the Pres­i­dent took of­fice in 2017. The US Pres­i­dent grew irate when Mr Turn­bull asked if Mr Trump planned to hon­our an agree­ment with pre­de­ces­sor Barack Obama to ac­cept 1,250 refugees held in Aus­tralian de­ten­tion cen­tres on Pa­cific is­lands.</p>
    <p>THE ERA OF WIN-WIN</p>
    <p>Australia es­tab­lished di­plo­matic ties with com­mu­nist China in 1972, seven years be­fore the US fully recog­nised the Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China.</p>
    <p>Trade links with Bei­jing grew as Australia shipped iron ore, coal and liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas to China, fu­elling the Chi­nese boom.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic re­la­tion­ship peaked with the sign­ing of a free trade agree­ment at the end of 2015 that low­ered Chi­nese tar­iffs on agri­cul­ture, dairy and wine, and promised to open the door for Aus­tralian bank­ing and other pro­fes­sional ser­vices to China’s re­stricted mar­ket.</p>
    <p>But Australia was jolted within months of the sign­ing when Bei­jing re­fused to recog­nise a 2016 in­ter­na­tional court rul­ing that China had no his­tor­i­cal claim over dis­puted is­lands in the South China Sea. The Turn­bull govern­ment joined Wash­ing­ton in re­buk­ing China.</p>
    <p>Can­berra was also be­com­ing con­cerned by grow­ing Chi­nese at­tempts at in­flu­ence in Australia, par­tic­u­larly through po­lit­i­cal do­na­tions from Chi­nese busi­ness­men to lo­cal politi­cians that had come to light.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber 2017, Mr Turn­bull in­tro­duced for­eign in­ter­fer­ence laws to Par­lia­ment. Among the ac­tiv­i­ties the law aimed to curb were the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party’s covert in­flu­ence over Chi­nese stu­dents on univer­sity cam­puses, in­ter­fer­ence by Bei­jing in lo­cal Chi­nese-lan­guage me­dia, and at­tempts by China to shape de­ci­sions by Aus­tralian politi­cians, from lo­cal coun­cils to fed­eral Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>A re­port on these and other Chi­nese ac­tiv­i­ties pre­pared by the Aus­tralian Se­cu­rity In­tel­li­gence Or­gan­i­sa­tion (ASIO), the coun­try’s na­tional se­cu­rity agency, had “gal­vanised us to take ac­tion”, Mr Turn­bull said at the time.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing re­acted fu­ri­ously to the for­eign in­ter­fer­ence leg­is­la­tion and re­sponded by freez­ing di­plo­matic vis­its. This in­cluded an end to an­nual lead­ers’ vis­its.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the 2017 re­port by ASIO, de­fence and se­cu­rity agen­cies took over run­ning China pol­icy, along with key ad­vis­ers in then Prime Min­is­ter Turn­bull’s of­fice, three for­mer di­plo­mats said. The For­eign Min­istry, which pre­ferred a low­erkey ap­proach, was side­lined.</p>
    <p>Cy­ber in­tru­sions were be­com­ing a ma­jor con­cern. Mr Alas­tair MacGib­bon, Mr Turn­bull’s spe­cial ad­viser on cy­ber se­cu­rity and for­mer head of the Aus­tralian Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Cen­tre, told Reuters that China was prob­ing com­pa­nies to gather in­tel­li­gence about re­sources or in­vest­ment ar­eas to ben­e­fit its state-owned en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>“China has very sig­nif­i­cant ca­pa­bil­ity, and was mak­ing strate­gic grabs of what com­peti­tors, friends and foes were do­ing,” said Mr MacGib­bon, who is now the chief</p>
    <p>strat­egy of­fi­cer at Cy­berCX, a pri­vate cy­ber se­cu­rity firm.</p>
    <p>RISE OF THE CHINA HAWKS</p>
    <p>In Au­gust 2018, Australia be­came the first coun­try to ef­fec­tively ban Chi­nese tech gi­ant Huawei from its next-gen­er­a­tion 5G tele­coms net­work on na­tional se­cu­rity grounds.</p>
    <p>Mr Turn­bull, who co-founded Australia’s first ma­jor In­ter­net ser­vice provider, ex­plained the logic be­hind the move. “If Huawei were to pro­vide your 5G net­work, or a large por­tion, does that give Huawei the ca­pa­bil­ity to dis­rupt large parts of your econ­omy? The an­swer is yes,” Mr Turn­bull told Reuters. “Do you want to give a for­eign state whose at­ti­tude to you may not al­ways be be­nign the ca­pa­bil­ity to in­flict harm? The an­swer is no.”</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian se­cu­rity of­fi­cials raised their con­cerns about Huawei with Wash­ing­ton, which fol­lowed Can­berra’s lead, im­pos­ing a ban on the Chi­nese firm in May last year. Of­fi­cials also trav­elled to Bri­tain to ex­plain Australia’s po­si­tion. The Bri­tish were fo­cused on Rus­sian in­ter­fer­ence, Mr MacGib­bon said, but the Aus­tralian of­fi­cials ar­gued they also needed to un­der­stand the risk from China.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing ini­tially de­cided Huawei would be al­lowed a lim­ited role in its 5G net­work, the Bri­tish govern­ment re­versed course in July, an­nounc­ing it would ban the com­pany from the coun­try’s 5G net­work by or­der­ing tele­coms firms to re­move its equip­ment by 2027.</p>
    <p>Huawei Australia said it did not en­gage in any ef­forts to in­ter­fere in the coun­try’s telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions net­works and was taken by sur­prise when Mr Turn­bull moved against the com­pany. “Up un­til that point, we were in the process of com­pet­ing for 5G busi­ness with all Aus­tralian net­work op­er­a­tors,” Mr Jeremy Mitchell, Huawei Australia’s chief cor­po­rate af­fairs of­fi­cer, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry said the Aus­tralian govern­ment banned Huawei “un­der the pre­text of na­tional se­cu­rity with­out any fac­tual ba­sis”.</p>
    <p>One of the of­fi­cials en­gaged with London over Huawei was Mr An­drew Shearer, who moved from the Of­fice of Na­tional In­tel­li­gence to be Mr Mor­ri­son’s Cab­i­net sec­re­tary last year. He has be­come a pow­er­ful voice on China pol­icy in the Prime Min­is­ter’s i nner cir­cle and has urged closer en­gage­ment with Ja­pan and In­dia, govern­ment sources told Reuters. In June, Australia sealed a strate­gic part­ner­ship with In­dia that granted the two coun­tries ac­cess to each other’s mil­i­tary bases and al­lowed for Australia to pro­vide In­dia with rare earths, met­als that are cru­cial to de­fence and space pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Mr Shearer worked in Wash­ing­ton at the Cen­tre for Strate­gic and In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies (CSIS), an in­flu­en­tial de­fence and se­cu­rity think-tank, be­tween 2016 and 2018. It was a time when at­ti­tudes to­wards Bei­jing were hard­en­ing among US Repub­li­cans and Democrats, said CSIS se­nior vi­cepres­i­dent for Asia Michael Green.</p>
    <p>Ap­pear­ing be­fore the US House Com­mit­tee on Armed Ser­vices in 2017, Mr Shearer told mem­bers China was in­tent on un­der­min­ing the lib­eral world or­der and the in­sti­tu­tions that un­der­pinned it.</p>
    <p>Mr Shearer worked on is­sues in­clud­ing China’s “grey zone” in­ter­fer­ence in the East and South China Seas – ag­gres­sive moves that stopped short of war, such as erect­ing and for­ti­fy­ing ar­ti­fi­cial is­lands. “We were look­ing for ways to har­ness al­liances and part­ner­ships to deter Bei­jing from es­ca­lat­ing fur­ther,” said Dr Green, who formerly served on the US Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>That think­ing was ev­i­dent in Mr Mor­ri­son’s re­cent an­nounce­ment that Australia will boost de­fence spend­ing by 40 per cent over the next decade. Mr Mor­ri­son said his de­fence strat­egy would bol­ster Australia’s abil­ity to re­spond to “op­er­a­tions in the ‘grey zone’ – fall­ing below the thresh­old of tra­di­tional armed con­flict”. Mr Shearer de­clined to com­ment for this story.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Maude, a se­nior fel­low at the Asia So­ci­ety Pol­icy In­sti­tute, led the govern­ment’s 2017 For­eign Pol­icy White Pa­per, a ma­jor re­think of a world where China and the US were more likely to clash.</p>
    <p>“Work­ing with other mid­dle pow­ers, in our own re­gion and glob­ally, makes a lot of sense for Australia in the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment. It helps show China we are not alone in our con­cerns,” said Mr Maude, a for­mer in­tel­li­gence agency di­rec­tor-gen­eral, who left the de­part­ment of for­eign af­fairs last year. “It is also a help­ful re­but­tal of China’s nar­ra­tive that Australia sim­ply does what the United States asks of us.”</p>
    <p>The sharpest pub­lic crit­i­cism of China has come from a bi­par­ti­san group of par­lia­men­tar­i­ans who call them­selves the Wolver­ines, in­spired by a group of teenagers who re­sist a Soviet in­va­sion in the 1980s movie Red Dawn. The group, none of whom is in the Cab­i­net, co­a­lesced last year.</p>
    <p>The most prom­i­nent Wolver­ine is for­mer spe­cial forces sol­dier and Lib­eral Party law­maker An­drew Hastie, who chairs Par­lia­ment’s in­tel­li­gence over­sight com­mit­tee. In Au­gust last year, he com­pared the West’s ap­proach to an au­thor­i­tar­ian China to the fail­ure of France to stop the ad­vance of Nazi Ger­many.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry said some Aus­tralian politi­cians and think-tanks had for some time been “spread­ing ru­mours to dis­credit China and se­verely poi­son­ing the at­mos­phere of bi­lat­eral re­la­tions”.</p>
    <p>Australia has pushed back against Chi­nese di­plo­mats who ob­ject to pub­lic crit­i­cism of Bei­jing. Chi­nese en­voys have been told by their Aus­tralian coun­ter­parts that do­mes­tic po­lit­i­cal de­bate and the me­dia are be­yond the con­trol of the govern­ment in a demo­cratic po­lit­i­cal sys­tem.</p>
    <p>”AN AWAK­EN­ING”</p>
    <p>When China threat­ened eco­nomic re­tal­i­a­tion over Australia’s call for a coro­n­avirus in­ves­ti­ga­tion in April, the phones started ring­ing in Trade Min­is­ter Si­mon Birm­ing­ham’s of­fice as in­dus­try heads called to ex­press con­cern. But pub­licly, Aus­tralian busi­ness lead­ers stayed largely quiet.</p>
    <p>Iron ore min­ers have also been largely re­strained, as they con­tin­ued to ship Australia’s most valu­able re­source, ex­tracted from the red, dry dirt of the Western Aus­tralian Pil­bara re­gion, to Chi­nese steel mak­ers. In June, Aus­tralian iron ore ship­ments hit a record A$9.9 bil­lion (S$9.8 bil­lion), push­ing an­nual ex­ports past A$100 bil­lion for the first time, as the only ri­val sup­plier, Brazil’s Vale, suf­fered Covid-19 shut­downs.</p>
    <p>“China needs our com­modi­ties – we do have some of the best iron ore in the world. It does mean Australia comes from a po­si­tion of strength,” Cham­ber of Min­er­als and En­ergy of Western Australia chief ex­ec­u­tive Paul Ever­ing­ham told Reuters. At the same time, he added, the iron ore in­dus­try is un­com­fort­able with the newly “ad­ver­sar­ial cli­mate”.</p>
    <p>But the ex­ec­u­tives have been told that com­plain­ing would pro­vide am­mu­ni­tion to Bei­jing for pro­pa­ganda against the Aus­tralian govern­ment, said an agri­cul­ture in­dus­try source. Com­pa­nies were ad­vised in­stead to work with Aus­tralian of­fi­cials to com­ply with the minu­tiae of Chi­nese red tape and ex­pose Bei­jing’s trade re­tal­i­a­tion for what it was.</p>
    <p>The govern­ment also told in­dus­try it was seek­ing al­ter­na­tive mar­kets for Aus­tralian goods, had ne­go­ti­ated ac­cess to In­done­sia, and was in talks with Bri­tain, Europe and In­dia.</p>
    <p>The muted re­sponse from the busi­ness com­mu­nity is in con­trast to 2018, when chief ex­ec­u­tives com­plained loudly that the Turn­bull govern­ment’s dis­pute with China risked dam­ag­ing trade, and im­plored him to fly to Bei­jing to fix it.</p>
    <p>“So much of the Aus­tralian busi­ness com­mu­nity, faced with crit­i­cism or a dif­fer­ence of opin­ion be­tween Australia and China, will side with China,” Mr Turn­bull re­calls of the sit­u­a­tion he faced as prime min­is­ter. But, he adds, “there has been an awak­en­ing”.</p>
