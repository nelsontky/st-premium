    <p>MADRID/ROME • Spain di­ag­nosed a record num­ber of new coro­n­avirus cases for a se­cond day on Thurs­day as in­fec­tions con­tin­ued to rise dur­ing the fes­tive pe­riod.</p>
    <p>New cases iden­ti­fied over the pre­vi­ous 24 hours climbed by 10,217, com­pared with 9,860 on Wed­nes­day. Spain re­ported 148 deaths in the pre­vi­ous 24 hours while the 14-day in­fec­tion rate rose to 280 per 100,000 peo­ple from 265.</p>
    <p>Spain has im­posed cur­fews and re­stric­tions on the size of meet­ings, while leav­ing the re­gional au­thor­i­ties to set the spe­cific con­di­tions for the pop­u­la­tions un­der their con­trol. Fes­tive gath­er­ings in the cap­i­tal Madrid are limited to six peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ital­ians spent an unusual New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day stay­ing at home as they were bound by a cur­few im­posed be­tween 10pm and 7am from Thurs­day to to­mor­row to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are pro­hib­ited from go­ing out un­less for es­sen­tial tasks such as work, health­care, shopping for food or to at­tend to an emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Italy re­ported 555 coro­n­avirus-re­lated deaths on Thurs­day against 575 the day be­fore, the Health Min­istry said. The daily tally of new cases rose to 23,477 from 16,202.</p>
    <p>There were 186,004 swab tests car­ried out in the past day, the min­istry said, up from the pre­vi­ous 169,045.</p>
    <p>Italy has seen an of­fi­cial to­tal of 74,159 Covid-19 deaths since its out­break came to light on Feb 21 last year, the high­est toll in Europe and the fifth high­est in the world.</p>
    <p>A re­port on Wed­nes­day by na­tional sta­tis­tics bureau Is­tat, which looked at deaths from all causes since the start of the pan­demic, sug­gested the num­ber of Covid-19 vic­tims in Italy is prob­a­bly higher than in­di­cated by of­fi­cial data.</p>
    <p>Italy has re­ported 2.107 mil­lion cases to date, the Health Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Covid-19 pa­tients in hospi­tal stood at 23,151 on Thurs­day, down by 415 from the day be­fore. There were 202 new ad­mis­sions to in­ten­sive care units, com­pared with 175 on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The cur­rent num­ber of pa­tients in in­ten­sive care rose by 27 – the first in­crease for at least a month – to 2,555, re­flect­ing those who died or were dis­charged af­ter recovery.</p>
    <p>When Italy’s se­cond wave of the epi­demic was ac­cel­er­at­ing fast in the first half of Novem­ber, hospi­tal ad­mis­sions were ris­ing by about 1,000 per day, while in­ten­sive care oc­cu­pancy was in­creas­ing by about 100 per day.</p>
    <p>To avoid mass travel in the tra­di­tional hol­i­day sea­son – which epi­demi­ol­o­gists fear would lead to a third pan­demic wave this month – the cen­tral govern­ment im­posed tighter rules to con­trol peo­ple’s move­ments from Dec 19.</p>
    <p>But the tough­est re­stric­tions were placed on the Dec 25 to 26 pe­riod and be­tween Thurs­day and to­mor­row. They in­clude a ban on travel be­tween cities, be­tween re­gions and within the cities, as well as a ban on any gath­er­ing, party, and celebratio­n in­doors, and the clo­sure of non-es­sen­tial shops.</p>
    <p>The of­fice of Italy’s Ex­traor­di­nary Com­mis­sioner for the Coro­n­avirus Emer­gency said 14,813 peo­ple were given the Covid-19 vac­cine as at Thurs­day. This com­prised 8,090 women and 6,723 men, most of them doc­tors, nurses and other health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>The coun­try kicked off its vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign on Dec 27. Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte said on Wed­nes­day that Italy plans to vac­ci­nate 10 mil­lion to 15 mil­lion of its roughly 60 mil­lion cit­i­zens against Covid-19 by April.</p>
