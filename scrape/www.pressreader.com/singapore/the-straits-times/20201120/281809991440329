    <p>• France is un­likely to lift a par­tial coro­n­avirus lock­down any time soon, said a gov­ern­ment spokesman, even if some curbs may be re­laxed be­fore Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron and top min­is­ters have dis­cussed the cri­sis, in­clud­ing whether to ease some re­stric­tions from Dec 1 “if con­di­tions al­low it”, spokesman Gabriel At­tal said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>But Mr At­tal in­sisted: “We’re not at all near end­ing the lock­down, we’re still far from it.”</p>
    <p>De­clines in new in­fec­tions since a sec­ond na­tion­wide lock­down be­gan on Oct 30 have sparked calls from busi­ness groups to let shops open as soon as Nov 27 for the “Black Fri­day” sales that kick off the hol­i­day shop­ping season.</p>
    <p>If not, they fear los­ing out to In­ter­net giants, such as Ama­zon, which are ex­pected to tar­get stuck-at-home shop­pers.</p>
    <p>The French may­ors’ as­so­ci­a­tion AMF also called on Wed­nes­day for a grad­ual re­open­ing of shops “to avoid a rush of clients ahead of Christ­mas, when al­low­ing them to re­sume op­er­a­tions will be i nevitable”.</p>
    <p>But on the same day, Fi­nance Min­is­ter Bruno Le Maire called on re­tail­ers – in­clud­ing e-com­merce firms – to post­pone the Black Fri­day mar­ket­ing blitz.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Macron him­self is again ex­pected to ad­dress the na­tion on the coro­n­avirus cri­sis next week, in par­tic­u­lar on the prospects for travel and fam­ily gath­er­ings for the fast-approachin­g hol­i­day break.</p>
    <p>But of­fi­cials are wary of tak­ing a “stop and go” ap­proach to fight­ing the out­break even if the pandemic slows, since hos­pi­tals re­main packed with Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties on Wed­nes­day re­ported 425 coro­n­avirus deaths in the pre­ced­ing 24 hours, and a to­tal of 4,775 pa­tients in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>To­tal deaths since the pandemic be­gan in France num­ber 46,698.</p>
    <p>This meant the vast ma­jor­ity of in­ten­sive care hospi­tal beds avail­able be­fore the cri­sis erupted are now oc­cu­pied – though the gov­ern­ment has scram­bled to make new ones avail­able.</p>
    <p>But the num­ber of peo­ple in in­ten­sive care has dropped from 4,919 since Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of daily new in­fec­tions on Wed­nes­day stood at 28,383, down from Tues­day’s 45,522 and far be­low the 50,000 to 60,000 when Mr Macron an­nounced the new par­tial lock­down last month.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Macron said the num­ber of daily cases must fall be­low 5,000 be­fore the gov­ern­ment could start sig­nif­i­cantly eas­ing the lat­est re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>So far, more than two mil­lion peo­ple in France have caught the Covid-19 dis­ease.</p>
