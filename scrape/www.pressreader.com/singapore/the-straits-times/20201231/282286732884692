    <p>The Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s (NTU) pi­o­neer en­gi­neer­ing batch of 1985 launched an en­dow­ment fund in hon­our of the univer­sity’s late Emer­i­tus Pro­fes­sor Chen Charng Ning yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Prof Chen – who was found­ing dean of NTU’s then School of Civil and Struc­tural En­gi­neer­ing, a deputy pres­i­dent of the univer­sity and found­ing chair­man of the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity – died on Nov 30 last year. He was 80 years old.</p>
    <p>He was also board chair­man of San­tarli Hold­ings, whose con­struc­tion arm seeded $1 mil­lion to the fund “with­out hes­i­ta­tion”, ac­cord­ing to for­mer MP Lee Bee Wah.</p>
    <p>She co-chairs the en­dow­ment fund com­mit­tee along­side fel­low for­mer MP In­der­jit Singh. They are both from the 1985 co­hort.</p>
    <p>The fund aims to award schol­ar­ships worth up to $15,000 and bur­saries of up to $10,000 an­nu­ally,</p>
    <p>for en­gi­neer­ing un­der­grad­u­ates from un­der­priv­i­leged fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>It is al­ready half­way to its goal of rais­ing at least $2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing as guest of hon­our at the launch, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said that for ev­ery dol­lar raised, the Govern­ment will con­trib­ute $1.50 to NTU’s gen­eral en­dow­ment fund.</p>
    <p>“On top of this, the Govern­ment also pro­vides a 250 per cent tax de­duc­tion to the donor. So, in to­tal, for ev­ery dol­lar do­nated, the Govern­ment con­trib­utes up to $2,” added Mr Heng, who is also Co­ordi</p>
    <p>nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies and Fi­nance Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said the en­dow­ment is par­tic­u­larly mean­ing­ful in the light of the Covid-19 outbreak. “Many un­der­grad­u­ates and their fam­i­lies are go­ing through dif­fi­cult times, and your gen­eros­ity can help en­sure we main­tain so­cial mo­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ers at the event took turns to de­scribe the late Prof Chen’s last­ing legacy.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee said Prof Chen was a car­ing and kind-hearted fa­therly fig­ure, as well as an ex­cel­lent teacher.</p>
    <p>“Many of his stu­dents are do­ing</p>
    <p>very well in the (con­struc­tion) in­dus­try and we owe it to him for im­part­ing his knowl­edge to us,” she said. “Prof Chen’s teach­ings and the mem­o­ries he gave us have left a pro­found im­pact on our lives. It is only be­fit­ting that we do some­thing to hon­our him.”</p>
    <p>Her batch­mates col­lec­tively felt that the most mean­ing­ful way to do so would be to set up an en­dow­ment fund, added Ms Lee.</p>
    <p>“The im­por­tance of ed­u­ca­tion is why Prof Chen went into the pro­fes­sion to im­part his knowl­edge to us,” she said. “We should pay it for</p>
    <p>ward by do­ing our part to make qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able for our next gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said Prof Chen left an in­deli­ble mark not just on his stu­dents and Sin­ga­pore, but also on the in­ter­na­tional stage.</p>
    <p>“He was ap­pointed by the World Bank on nu­mer­ous oc­ca­sions to work on projects, in­clud­ing in China, Viet­nam and Laos. His work helped to im­prove the lives of many peo­ple in the re­gion.”</p>
