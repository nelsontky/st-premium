    <p>There is suf­fi­cient space in shel­ters for the home­less, which saw a surge in peo­ple seek­ing refuge dur­ing the two-month cir­cuit breaker that ended on June 1.</p>
    <p>About 85 per cent of the 700 spa­ces at Safe Sound Sleep­ing Places (S3Ps) were oc­cu­pied as of July 10, a Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) spokesman told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently 29 S3Ps, up from just seven in March.</p>
    <p>Th­ese S3Ps are mostly reli­gious or­gan­i­sa­tions that al­low the home­less to stay for the night on their premises.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, groups that started op­er­at­ing as S3Ps in May in­clude Trin­ity Methodist Church, Bible House and Tao One, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that runs a Taoist tem­ple and other ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The MSF spokesman said: “Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, the MSF worked closely with our part­ners that re­sponded to the ur­gent call for shel­ter sup­port to set up more Safe Sound Sleep­ing Places to help those who have been af­fected by the Covid-19 mea­sures.”</p>
    <p>There are also tran­si­tional shel­ters, which of­fer the home­less a longer stay.</p>
    <p>As of July 15, about 60 per cent of the fam­ily units and 85 per cent of the in­di­vid­ual units at the three tran­si­tional shel­ters were oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently about 80 fam­i­lies and 60 in­di­vid­u­als in the tran­si­tional shel­ters, run by AMKFSC Com­mu­nity Ser­vices, Awwa and New Hope Com­mu­nity Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple can usu­ally stay for up to six months at th­ese shel­ters, so­cial work­ers say, while their staff help them find hous­ing and em­ploy­ment, and help them work through the is­sues they face.</p>
    <p>Home­less shel­ter Tran­sit Point @ Mar­garet Drive, which opened in March and has space for 74 res­i­dents, is cur­rently 95 per cent full.</p>
    <p>Ms Lil­ian Ong, di­rec­tor of so­cial work at New Hope Com­mu­nity Ser­vices which runs the shel­ter, said the num­ber of peo­ple seek­ing refuge dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, which started on April 7, shot up by about three times to about 20 new cases a week.</p>
    <p>In May, then Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Des­mond Lee told Par­lia­ment that nearly 300 home­less peo­ple had sought help from aid net­work Part­ners En­gag­ing and Em­pow­er­ing Rough Sleep­ers (Peers) dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The Peers net­work com­prises gov­ern­ment agen­cies, reli­gious groups and char­i­ties. It was launched in July last year to en­sure bet­ter co­or­di­na­tion and syn­ergy in the de­liv­ery of ser­vices to help the home­less.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee, who is now Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment and Min­is­ter-in-charge of So­cial Ser­vices In­te­gra­tion, said in a Face­book post last Wed­nes­day that over 60 com­mu­nity or­gan­i­sa­tions now work with gov­ern­ment agen­cies to reach out to “be­friend, shel­ter and sup­port home­less Sin­ga­pore­ans”.</p>
    <p>Ms Ong said those who were al­ready home­less be­fore the Covid-19 cri­sis sought a space in a shel­ter – which they had pre­vi­ously shunned – as they felt it would be safer to be in one, given the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Derek Lim, a vol­un­teer at char­ity Home­less Hearts of Sin­ga­pore, added that some men who did so were also “wor­ried about get­ting fined for loi­ter­ing (dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker)”.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said th­ese men may have pre­vi­ously de­cided not to seek help at a shel­ter as they dis­like stay­ing with oth­ers, among other rea­sons.</p>
    <p>There were also those who were made home­less by the pan­demic. Th­ese in­cluded peo­ple who lost their jobs and could no longer af­ford to pay rent, and Sin­ga­pore­ans left stranded here de­spite hav­ing a home in Malaysia af­ter the Malaysian gov­ern­ment banned for­eign­ers from en­ter­ing the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said there is a group of Sin­ga­pore­ans who live in Johor Baru or Batam but who work as driv­ers, se­cu­rity guards or hold other bluecol­lar jobs in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
