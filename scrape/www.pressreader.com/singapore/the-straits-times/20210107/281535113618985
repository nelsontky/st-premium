    <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is­sued a dire warn­ing at the coun­try’s first rul­ing party congress in five years, say­ing that devel­op­ment plans fell far short of their goals and that the party would ex­plore a new path for mak­ing a “big leap for­ward”.</p>

    <p>SEOUL • North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un is­sued a dire warn­ing at the coun­try’s first rul­ing party congress in five years, say­ing devel­op­ment plans fell far short of their goals and that the party would ex­plore a “new path” for mak­ing a “big leap for­ward”.</p>
    <p>The days-long Work­ers’ Party congress on Tues­day – con­vened to draft a new eco­nomic plan – be­gan shortly af­ter Mr Kim skipped his usual New Year’s Day ad­dress.</p>
    <p>In his open­ing re­marks, Mr Kim said the party’s pre­vi­ous five-year devel­op­ment plan, which ended last year, missed its tar­gets due to both “in­ter­nal and ex­ter­nal chal­lenges”, the of­fi­cial Korean Cen­tral News Agency (KCNA) re­ported.</p>
    <p>“The goals we set were im­mensely un­der­achieved in al­most all sec­tors,” Mr Kim said, ac­cord­ing to KCNA, mak­ing a rare ad­mis­sion of fault by plan­ners.</p>
    <p>Re­marks re­ported by state me­dia did not men­tion any plans by Mr Kim to re­vive stalled ne­go­ti­a­tions with the United States to cur­tail Py­ongyang’s nu­clear arms pro­gramme in ex­change for eas­ing the sanc­tions that are chok­ing the state’s pal­try econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The gath­er­ing of 5,000 del­e­gates and party of­fi­cials is be­ing closely watched for clues to how Mr Kim will ap­proach the ad­min­is­tra­tion of US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr Koh Yu-hwan, pres­i­dent of the gov­ern­ment-funded Korea In­sti­tute for Na­tional Uni­fi­ca­tion think-tank in Seoul, said North Korea would prob­a­bly hint at its US and South Korea strat­egy in later congress meet­ings.</p>
    <p>“North Korea may have cal­cu­lated that the sanc­tions regime will last for a while,” Mr Koh said. “It is find­ing prob­lems in­ter­nally to speed up the eco­nomic re­cov­ery, things North Korea can do dur­ing the sanc­tions regime.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kim is one of the few world lead­ers yet to con­grat­u­late – or even ac­knowl­edge – Mr Bi­den’s elec­toral de­feat of Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who dis­pensed with decades of US for­eign pol­icy to hold three meet­ings with the North Korean leader.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s camp has sig­nalled more room for ne­go­ti­a­tions, and the Pres­i­dent-elect’s choice for sec­re­tary of state, Antony Blinken, has backed a ne­go­ti­ated set­tle­ment with Py­ongyang that freezes and then rolls back its nu­clear pro­gramme in re­turn for re­wards.</p>
    <p>State me­dia also did not ex­plain what Mr Kim’s “big leap for­ward” would en­tail, other than that the congress would lay the ground­work for lift­ing liv­ing stan­dards.</p>
    <p>The meet­ing, where lead­er­ship changes are ex­pected, comes as Mr Kim’s bat­tered econ­omy was dealt fur­ther blows by nat­u­ral dis­as­ters and his de­ci­sion to shut bor­ders due to the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>North Korea’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct likely shrank by 8.5 per cent last year, ac­cord­ing to a pro­jec­tion by Fitch So­lu­tions, leav­ing it smaller than when Mr Kim took power in 2011 with a pledge to im­prove peo­ple’s liv­ing stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim has few op­tions to turn around fi­nances but a United Na­tions Se­cu­rity Coun­cil re­port said he has used il­le­gal ship-to-ship trans­fers of con­tra­band and cy­ber crimes to earn money.</p>
    <p>Im­ages of the congress in state me­dia showed Mr Kim’s sis­ter, Kim Yo Jong, seated a row be­hind the leader, eas­ing re­cent spec­u­la­tion among ob­servers that her power had been clipped af­ter she led a con­tentious pres­sure cam­paign against South Korea.</p>
    <p>Mr Kim also in­di­cated that purges of cadres could be un­der­way. Last year, he dressed down of­fi­cials for fall­ing short of goals, most promi­nently in July when he lashed out at the “care­less bud­get­ing” for a show­case hos­pi­tal con­struc­tion project in Py­ongyang that had fallen be­hind sched­ule. The project ap­pears to have been hit by a short­age of build­ing ma­te­ri­als, un­der­scor­ing the dif­fi­culty he faces to im­prove liv­ing con­di­tions while toil­ing un­der sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>The North Korean leader’s most re­cent pub­lic speech – at a mil­i­tary pa­rade in Oc­to­ber – fea­tured a rare show of emo­tion, with him ap­pear­ing to cry as he talked about the coun­try’s eco­nomic strug­gles un­der in­ter­na­tional sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>He also rolled out sev­eral new weapons de­signed to strike Amer­i­can and al­lied forces, in­clud­ing what is be­lieved to be the world’s largest road-mo­bile in­ter­con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­sile.</p>
    <p>“I am scep­ti­cal (Mr Kim) will dis­cuss the new Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion in de­tail, if he even men­tions it ex­plic­itly,” said in­de­pen­dent po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Rachel Miny­oung Lee, who used to work for the US gov­ern­ment in ar­eas re­lated to North Korea. “Kim will prob­a­bly want to main­tain flex­i­bil­ity as the new US ad­min­is­tra­tion for­mu­lates its North Korea pol­icy.”</p>
