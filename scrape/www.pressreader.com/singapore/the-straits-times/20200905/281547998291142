    <p>In­dian De­fence Min­is­ter Ra­j­nath Singh and his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Wei Fenghe were ex­pected to hold talks in Moscow yes­ter­day, gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials said. Both min­is­ters are in Moscow at­tend­ing a Shang­hai Co­op­er­a­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion meet­ing, an In­dian gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial said. The re­quest for the meet­ing came from the Chi­nese side, the of­fi­cial added.</p>
    <p>NEW DELHI • The de­fence min­is­ters of In­dia and China were ex­pected to hold talks in Moscow yes­ter­day, gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials said, the high­est-level face-to-face po­lit­i­cal con­tact since ten­sions flared along their dis­puted moun­tain bor­der in May.</p>
    <p>Both sides de­ployed ad­di­tional forces along the fron­tier run­ning through the west­ern Hi­malayas af­ter a clash in June dur­ing which 20 In­dian sol­diers were killed in hand-to-hand fight­ing.</p>
    <p>In­dian De­fence Min­is­ter Ra­j­nath Singh was given clear­ance to meet his Chi­nese coun­ter­part Wei Fenghe in Moscow, where both are at­tend­ing a Shang­hai Co­op­er­a­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion meet­ing, an In­dian gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>The re­quest for the meet­ing came from the Chi­nese side, the of­fi­cial added. “Sub­se­quently a green sig­nal was given for the meet­ing,” the of­fi­cial said, ask­ing not to be iden­ti­fied be­cause of In­dian ser­vice rules.</p>
    <p>There was no word from China, but Mr Hu Xi­jin, edi­tor-in-chief of China’s state-backed Global Times news­pa­per, said on Twit­ter that a meet­ing be­tween the de­fence min­is­ters was ex­pected.</p>
    <p>“Based on what I know, this ar­range­ment be­tween the two sides has made progress. The meet­ing be­tween Wei Fenghe and Ra­j­nath Singh has a big prob­a­bil­ity to be held,” Mr Hu said.</p>
    <p>De­spite the bru­tal­ity of the clash in June, both sides ap­peared to ob­serve a pro­to­col to avoid the use of firearms in the high-al­ti­tude re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tary com­man­ders and diplo­mats have been hold­ing talks to end the stand-off on the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol, or the de facto bor­der, but there has been lit­tle progress.</p>
    <p>Last week­end, In­dian of­fi­cials said forces on the bor­der mo­bilised to de­ter Chi­nese troops, whose move­ments sug­gested they aimed to oc­cupy hill­tops that In­dia con­sid­ered to be within its ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>In­dia ex­e­cuted a stealthy night­time op­er­a­tion on Mon­day to claim the strate­gic out­posts of­fer­ing a clear view of troop move­ments in the dis­puted ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>The ac­tion was also taken to counter what In­dia saw as en­hanced Chi­nese de­ploy­ment of troops close to the Thakung base in In­dian ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>China, how­ever, has blamed In­dia for tres­pass­ing the LAC, say­ing the “move has grossly vi­o­lated China’s ter­ri­to­rial sovereignt­y”, ac­cord­ing to a Chi­nese em­bassy spokesman in New Delhi.</p>
    <p>But both coun­tries have re­peat­edly re­it­er­ated that they are keen on talks to re­solve the process, with mil­i­tary of­fi­cials meet­ing for sev­eral days this week south of Ladakh’s Pan­gong Tso lake, where the lat­est flare-up oc­curred.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion along the LAC is slightly tense,” In­dian army chief Gen­eral Manoj Mukund Nar­a­vane told Reuters part­ner ANI dur­ing a tour of the fron­tier in the Ladakh re­gion, adding that he be­lieved talks could help re­solve the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“We are sure that the prob­lem can be re­solved fully through talks,” he added.</p>
    <p>A United States gov­ern­ment source told Reuters in Wash­ing­ton that the US as­sess­ment is that nei­ther China nor In­dia are in­ter­ested in push­ing the dis­pute to the point that they would en­gage in war.</p>
    <p>Both In­dia and China have moved thou­sands of troops, tanks, ar­tillery guns and fighter jets close to the bor­der since their stand-off be­gan in May.</p>
    <p>SOME TEN­SION The sit­u­a­tion along the LAC is slightly tense. We are sure that the prob­lem can be re­solved fully ’’ through talks. GEN­ERAL MANOJ MUKUND NAR­A­VANE, In­dian army chief, to Reuters part­ner ANI dur­ing a tour of the fron­tier in the Ladakh re­gion.</p>
