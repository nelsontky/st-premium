    <p>Sin­ga­porean singer-song­writer JJ Lin misses Sin­ga­pore dearly.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing a global lis­ten­ing party on YouTube on Mon­day night to pre­view his new al­bum – which is sung mostly in Man­darin – the Taipeibase­d mu­si­cian, 39, said: “I re­ally miss home, I re­ally miss home... I want to go home.”</p>
    <p>His lat­est work, ti­tled Drifter • Like You Do was re­leased yes­ter­day. It con­sists of a six-track EP Drifter, and a sec­ond EP, Like You Do, which cur­rently has one English track. More tracks on this sec­ond EP will be re­leased in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>The songs had an en­thu­si­as­tic re­cep­tion from a host of celebrity guests, such as Tai­wanese singer­song­writer Jam Hsiao, Chi­nese ac­tress Seven Tan and Hong Kong rap­per-singer Jack­son Wang.</p>
    <p>Lin’s last stu­dio al­bum, Mes­sage In A Bot­tle (2017), was nom­i­nated for six awards at the 29th Golden Melody Awards, in­clud­ing for Song of the Year and Best Com­poser.</p>
    <p>Mon­day’s lis­ten­ing party was hosted by Tai­wan’s Mickey Huang.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the event, Lin, who was dressed in a light-grey denim jacket and black trousers, said: “I per­son­ally feel ev­ery­one who lives in this world is con­sid­ered a drifter.</p>
    <p>“In this al­bum, I wrote about some of my ex­pe­ri­ences and emo­tions since my last al­bum three years ago. From an ob­server’s stand­point, I also cap­tured many scenes.</p>
    <p>“Through the process, I re­alised many things which I lost and gained. I feel this al­bum is like an ex­plo­ration of life, time and space.”</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the song Drifter is about the dreams of peo­ple at ev­ery stage of life, as well as the pres­sures and ob­sta­cles they face.</p>
    <p>Tan, 30, who is known for her roles in Chi­nese tele­vi­sion se­ries The Fox’s Sum­mer (2017) and Go Ahead (2020), felt very moved by the new track.</p>
    <p>She added she had been a fan since Lin re­leased his first song. “His songs have given me en­ergy and a sense of safety.”</p>
    <p>Lin’s de­but al­bum, Mu­sic Voy­ager, was re­leased in 2003.</p>
    <p>An­other of his new tracks, The Lost Ones, was writ­ten two years ago and in­spired by a starry sky he once saw in New Zealand.</p>
    <p>He said: “I had never seen such a sky of bright stars and felt in­spired that ev­ery star rep­re­sents a soul, a friend that has left us.”</p>
    <p>On shar­ing his mu­sic at the lis­ten­ing party, Lin added: “I have lis­tened to my (songs) many times, but hear­ing (them) in this way just now, I feel qui­etly moved. I feel like we are to­gether.”</p>
