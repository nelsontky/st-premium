    <p>WP chair­man Sylvia Lim calls for re­view of eth­nic clas­si­fi­ca­tion</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party chair­man Sylvia Lim, who was brought up in an English-speak­ing fam­ily, found her­self “con­stantly feel­ing in­ad­e­quate” about the state of her Man­darin.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore I en­tered pol­i­tics, my knowl­edge of Chi­nese cus­toms and prac­tices was fo­cused on cel­e­brat­ing Chi­nese New Year,” she re­called of her lim­i­ta­tions in this area, which she said she was not proud of.</p>
    <p>She shared her per­sonal story to make the point about how she, as a mem­ber of the Chi­nese ma­jor­ity, does not need to pass a test of “Chi­nese-ness” to qual­ify as a can­di­date in an elec­tion.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, elec­toral re­quire­ments un­der the group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency sys­tem tend to put a fo­cus on mi­nor­ity rep­re­sen­ta­tion, which she said can put an un­com­fort­able spot­light on mi­nor­ity can­di­dates who must file an ap­pli­ca­tion to show they are “Malay enough” or “In­dian enough” to qual­ify for an elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim (Alju­nied GRC) said the role of race in elec­tions should be re­viewed as part of steps to move to­wards a race-blind so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>She also sug­gested sev­eral ar­eas that could be re­viewed, in­clud­ing the Chi­nese, Malay, In­dian and Other model of eth­nic clas­si­fi­ca­tion.</p>
