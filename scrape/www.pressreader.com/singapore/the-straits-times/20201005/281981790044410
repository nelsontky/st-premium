    <p>Deaf since birth, Mr Ken Tan strug­gled to find work un­til he got a job wash­ing dishes in a kitchen when he was 19.</p>
    <p>He threw him­self into his work, gain­ing ex­pe­ri­ence at es­tab­lish­ments such as Ajisen Ra­men, Black­bird Group and Etto, and slowly rose through the ranks, go­ing from com­mis chef to head chef.</p>
    <p>This year, Mr Tan, 39, struck out on his own to re­alise his dream of run­ning his own food out­let, open­ing a stall sell­ing crispy prawn-paste chicken wings at Toh Guan Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion for the Deaf (SADeaf) marked Sin­ga­pore Sign Lan­guage Week last month with vir­tual shar­ing ses­sions fea­tur­ing Mr Tan and three other pre­sen­ters who spoke about their ex­pe­ri­ence of not let­ting their hear­ing loss hold them back.</p>
    <p>Like Mr Tan, Ms Vanessa Chea, 23, also had to over­come chal­lenges af­ter she suf­fered from mild hear­ing loss as a tod­dler.</p>
    <p>Af­ter grad­u­at­ing from Te­masek Polytech­nic with a diploma in phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal sci­ence in 2018, she was ac­cepted into Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s bi­o­log­i­cal sciences pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>But her hear­ing wors­ened and she could not use her hear­ing aids.</p>
    <p>Ms Chea took a gap year from univer­sity and un­der­went cochlear im­plant surgery. Last year, she re­sumed her univer­sity stud­ies as a fresh­man.</p>
    <p>On how Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety can be more in­clu­sive to­wards deaf peo­ple, she said: “Dif­fer­ent peo­ple have dif­fer­ent de­grees of hear­ing loss and pre­fer dif­fer­ent modes of com­mu­ni­ca­tion. Some may pre­fer sign lan­guage while oth­ers are fine with read­ing lips and speak­ing orally.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple must re­mem­ber that hear­ing loss does not equate to in­tel­lec­tual dis­abil­ity.”</p>
    <p>For teacher David Lee, he took a longer route to real­is­ing his dream of be­com­ing an ed­u­ca­tor.</p>
    <p>The 51-year-old spe­cialised teacher at Mayflower Pri­mary School has been deaf since birth.</p>
    <p>When he was first di­ag­nosed as a tod­dler, his mother at­tended sign lan­guage class at SADeaf at night af­ter her work and taught it to his two older sib­lings.</p>
    <p>He be­came an en­gi­neer af­ter grad­u­at­ing from Ngee Ann Polytech­nic in 1992, but was laid off dur­ing the fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 1997. It was then that he de­cided to pur­sue a ca­reer in teach­ing, which he had been in­ter­ested in since be­ing in­spired by a deaf teacher in his pri­mary school.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee said: “I thought to my­self, ‘Wow, he can sign so well. He can nar­rate many sto­ries so well’.”</p>
    <p>He took on a full-time teach­ing job with the Sin­ga­pore School for the Deaf in 2002 while pur­su­ing his teach­ing qual­i­fi­ca­tion from the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Education.</p>
    <p>Eigh­teen years on, Mr Lee said he sees grow­ing in­clu­sive­ness in schools here, with note-tak­ers who as­sist deaf stu­dents with tran­scrip­tion and sign lan­guage in­ter­preters from SADeaf help­ing deaf stu­dents in main­stream schools and ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>“To sup­port full in­clu­sive­ness in the Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety, we have a long way to go. These days, things are bet­ter for the deaf stu­dents who are in institutes of higher learning.</p>
    <p>“Last year, I con­ducted the sign lan­guage course for the Pri­mary 1 and 2 co­horts. Now they still greet me in sign lan­guage with a sim­ple sign – ‘Hi’,” he said.</p>
    <p>From an early age, Mr Muham­mad Am­mar Nas­rul­haq Ab­dul Karim has been drawn to dance and ex­press­ing him­self through move­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Am­mar, 28, who lost his hear­ing af­ter a high fever when he was an in­fant, started free­lanc­ing as a dancer in 2010. “My dif­fi­cul­ties ini­tially pre­vented me from danc­ing to the beat. But I dis­cov­ered that my sense of sight was height­ened, and through the use of the dancer’s move­ment, I was able to keep my­self in time with the mu­sic,” he said.</p>
    <p>He has been danc­ing for more than a decade and is now a chore­og­ra­pher and in­struc­tor with Redea­f­i­na­tion, a hip hop group for the deaf.</p>
    <p>He hopes to in­spire other deaf artists through his work.</p>
    <p>“I can only hope that through my art, ev­ery­one is able to see my tal­ent first, then my dis­abil­ity.”</p>
