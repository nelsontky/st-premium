    <p>Dr Shi Xu once said that fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity and job se­cu­rity were the two dreams he and his wife had when they moved to Sin­ga­pore from China in the early 1990s.</p>
    <p>Af­ter al­most three decades, they have be­come bil­lion­aires with the list­ing of their com­pany, Nanofilm Tech­nolo­gies In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>The provider of nan­otech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions for smart­phones and other elec­tron­ics ended 12.4 per cent up at $2.91, from its ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) price of $2.59, in its trad­ing de­but yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Dr Shi’s for­tune, mainly made up of the 53 per cent Nanofilm stake he holds with his wife, has surged to al­most US$880 mil­lion (S$1.2 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex. The com­pany de­clined to com­ment on the cou­ple’s wealth.</p>
    <p>The IPO raised over $470 mil­lion, tak­ing the firm’s mar­ket value to $1.9 bil­lion and mark­ing the largest pri­mary list­ing on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) since 2017, ex­clud­ing real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts for which the city state is a global hub.</p>
    <p>“Nanofilm is a rare tech­nol­ogy man­u­fac­tur­ing IPO on the SGX in re­cent years, bring­ing a fresh per­spec­tive for lo­cal in­vestors,” said Ms Mar­garet Yang, a strate­gist at Dai­lyFX.</p>
    <p>With com­put­ers and wear­able de­vices its main rev­enue drivers and more than 70 per cent of sales com­ing from China, the com­pany is set to ben­e­fit from the grow­ing de­mand for dig­i­tal de­vices amid Covid-19, she said. “It may at­tract other lo­cally in­cu­bated tech firms to con­sider list­ing at home.”</p>
    <p>Dr Shi, 56, founded Nanofilm in 1999 with US$300,000. It started as a tech start-up spun off from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) – where he worked as an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor – af­ter Hi­tachi sought to adopt his coat­ing tech­nol­ogy to its hard-disk drives.</p>
    <p>When NTU de­cided to cre­ate a com­pany to com­mer­cialise the tech­nol­ogy, the school asked him to lead it. Dr Shi said in an in­ter­view with a lo­cal mag­a­zine in 2018 that he was “‘forced’ to go into busi­ness” and ini­tially ne­go­ti­ated to take no-pay leave from the univer­sity for two years as a backup plan.</p>
    <p>Now Nanofilm has more than 1,400 em­ploy­ees in of­fices in Sin­ga­pore, Ja­pan, China and Viet­nam. Its rev­enue climbed more than 40 per cent in the first half of the year, af­ter grow­ing 16 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>While the firm’s main cus­tomers in­clude Fuji Xerox, Mi­crosoft and Huawei Tech­nolo­gies, it noted that the re­liance on its largest client, a tech com­pany it did not iden­tify, could be a risk fac­tor – this tech com­pany gen­er­ated more than half of Nanofilm’s sales last year.</p>
    <p>The of­fer­ing’s 13 cor­ner­stone in­vestors in­clude Aberdeen Stan­dard In­vest­ments (Asia), Credit Suisse, JPMor­gan As­set Man­age­ment (Sin­ga­pore) and Venezio In­vest­ments, a wholly owned sub­sidiary of in­vest­ment firm Te­masek.</p>
    <p>Te­masek it­self will be­come a sub­stan­tial share­holder fol­low­ing the list­ing and sale of cor­ner­stone shares.</p>
    <p>Dr Shi, who is ex­ec­u­tive chair­man of Nanofilm, has no re­grets about leav­ing the aca­demic life, which his wife, Ms Jin Xiao Qun, viewed as an “iron rice bowl” – or stable job, as per a Chi­nese say­ing. She is the com­pany’s as­sis­tant vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“Busi­ness is so much more chal­leng­ing, com­pared with teach­ing,” Dr Shi told The Peak mag­a­zine in 2018. “If you asked me to go back, I might feel bored.”</p>
