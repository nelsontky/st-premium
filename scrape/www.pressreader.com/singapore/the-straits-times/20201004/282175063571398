    <p>New re­gional train­ing cen­tres will be set up next year, as the Sin­ga­pore Badminton As­so­ci­a­tion (SBA) seeks to raise the qual­ity of play and in­crease the sport’s pop­u­lar­ity and ac­ces­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>SBA pres­i­dent Lawrence Leow, who was re-elected un­op­posed for a sec­ond term at its vir­tual an­nual gen­eral meet­ing yes­ter­day week, is also look­ing at high per­for­mance and estab­lish­ing a wider base of na­tional play­ers and coaches.</p>
    <p>The four to five cen­tres, likely to be sit­u­ated at the north, south, east, west and cen­tral zones, will pro­vide coach­ing for foun­da­tional and elite lev­els. It will first cater to those aged 13 to 17 be­fore ex­pand­ing to the un­der-13 age group.</p>
    <p>The as­so­ci­a­tion hopes to launch these cen­tres next April, said Leow, adding that the SBA sec­re­tariat is in ad­vanced dis­cus­sions with na­tional agency Sport Sin­ga­pore to con­firm the venues and whether selected coaches or academies will run the re­spec­tive fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Leow, 62, also re­vealed his goal of cre­at­ing a Sin­ga­porean core within the na­tional coach­ing set-up by 2025. He said: “Lo­cal coaches have a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of the lo­cal cul­ture, con­text and men­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>“To­day, Sin­ga­porean coaches are not re­ally helm­ing the na­tional team and that is some­thing we can work on chang­ing – not to the ex­tent of re­plac­ing the for­eign coaches who will re­main an in­stru­men­tal part of our set-up – but to have at least an ad­e­quate lo­cal pres­ence.”</p>
    <p>In­done­sians Mu­lyo Han­doyo and Nu­nung Wibiyanto are the cur­rent na­tional head coaches for sin­gles and dou­bles. They are as­sisted by Sin­ga­pore­ans Kelvin Ho and Noor Izwan, Malaysians Lim Pek Siah and Yap Kim Hock and In­done­sian Prib­adi Se­tia At­maja.</p>
    <p>Be­sides send­ing the coaches overseas for ex­pe­ri­ence and ex­po­sure, the SBA is also de­vel­op­ing a na­tional grad­ing sys­tem, which will serve as a plat­form for eval­u­a­tion and feed­back to play­ers on their pro­fi­ciency level.</p>
    <p>This will com­pli­ment the na­tional rank­ing sys­tem in­tro­duced last year, cov­er­ing 1,183 play­ers.</p>
    <p>Leow said: “The aim is to cre­ate a</p>
    <p>larger na­tional tal­ent pool with strong fun­da­men­tals. The SBA is cur­rently work­ing with a selected academy to flesh out the de­tailed cri­te­ria for each grad­ing level.”</p>
    <p>At last year’s SEA Games in the Philip­pines, Sin­ga­pore won one silver (Loh Kean Yew in the men’s sin­gles) and two bronze medals (men and women’s teams).</p>
    <p>The ex­panded SBA’s man­age­ment com­mit­tee – from 11 elected and three co-opted mem­bers to 17 and a max­i­mum of seven, re­spec­tively – will fo­cus on the strate­gic ar­eas of as­sets and fa­cil­i­ties, path­way and de­vel­op­ment, mem­ber­ship and part­ners, tour­na­ment and tech­ni­cal of­fi­cials, and busi­ness</p>
    <p>and awards.</p>
    <p>The key po­si­tions in the MC will be de­cided later this month, with one vice-pres­i­dent as­signed to over­see each area.</p>
    <p>Leow, whose long-term am­bi­tion is for Sin­ga­pore to cap­ture an Olympic medal by 2028, urged the fra­ter­nity to unite and be bold in con­tribut­ing ideas.</p>
    <p>He said: “We must adopt the at­ti­tude that there is no idea that is too wild and no dream that can­not come true. The key is to set out a com­pre­hen­sive road map with re­al­is­tic tar­gets that will guide us to­wards re­al­is­ing our goals.”</p>
