    <p>More malls in Or­chard Road, in­clud­ing Or­chard Cen­tral, Or­chard Gate­way, Lucky Plaza and Plaza Sin­ga­pura, have been added to the list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were in­fec­tious, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>For Or­chard Gate­way, the lo­ca­tion vis­ited in the mall was the Chim­pChamp Fit­ness gym.</p>
    <p>Other new lo­ca­tions added to the list, which can be found on MOH’s web­site, were beauty sa­lon Bon Aes­thet­ics at SingPost Cen­tre and the</p>
    <p>Bar Bar Black Sheep cof­feeshop bar in Robert­son Quay.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes to get those who were at th­ese places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>MOH has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid th­ese places as they would have been cleaned, if needed.</p>
    <p>There were 123 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 48,035.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded 11 com­mu­nity cases, com­pris­ing five Sin­ga­pore­ans, one work pass holder and five work per­mit hold­ers.</p>
    <p>There were also two im­ported cases – one work pass holder and one work per­mit holder.</p>
    <p>They were placed on stay-home no­tice upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore on July 8 from the Philip­pines and tested while serv­ing their no­tice.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers liv­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the 110 re­main­ing cases.</p>
    <p>No new clus­ters were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MOH also said that the av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from 14 two weeks ago to 10 in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from a daily av­er­age of eight to five over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 285 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 44,356 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 183 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 3,454 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
