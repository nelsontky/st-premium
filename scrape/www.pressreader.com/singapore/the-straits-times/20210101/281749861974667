    <p>NUM­BER OF PEO­PLE KILLED BY CON­VICTED MUR­DERER SA­MUEL LIT­TLE, WHO DIED ON WED­NES­DAY IN CAL­I­FOR­NIA AGED 80</p>
    <p>LOS ANGELES • Con­victed mur­derer Sa­muel Lit­tle, who con­fessed to stran­gling 93 peo­ple and was con­sid­ered by the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion (FBI) to be the most pro­lific se­rial killer in United States his­tory, died on Wed­nes­day at a Cal­i­for­nia hos­pi­tal, the state correction­s depart­ment said. He was 80.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle had been serv­ing three con­sec­u­tive sen­tences of life with­out pa­role for the killing of three women in Los Angeles County dur­ing the late 1980s, mur­ders to which he was linked through DNA that matched sam­ples found at the crime scenes.</p>
    <p>He was con­victed of first-de­gree mur­der by a Los Angeles County jury on Sept 25, 2014, and be­gan serv­ing his prison sen­tence about two months later.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the FBI, Lit­tle be­gan con­fess­ing to ad­di­tional mur­ders to a Texas Ranger who in­ter­viewed him i n his Cal­i­for­nia prison cell in 2018, and ul­ti­mately ad­mit­ted to killing 93 peo­ple across the coun­try by stran­gu­la­tion be­tween 1970 and 2005.</p>
    <p>The FBI said in­ves­ti­ga­tors have since ver­i­fied 50 of those con­fes­sions, with many more pend­ing fi­nal con­fir­ma­tion, mak­ing him the dead­li­est US se­rial killer on record.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have said he ap­peared to have tar­geted mostly vul­ner­a­ble young black women, many of them pros­ti­tutes or drug ad­dicts, whose deaths were not well</p>
    <p>pub­li­cised at the time and in some cases not recorded as homi­cides.</p>
    <p>Many of his vic­tims’ deaths were orig­i­nally ruled over­doses or at­trib­uted to ac­ci­den­tal or un­de­ter­mined causes, and some bodies were never re­cov­ered, ac­cord­ing to an FBI pro­file of the killer.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle served two prior sen­tences in a Cal­i­for­nia state prison, in­clud­ing a four-year term end­ing in 1987 for as­sault with a deadly weapon and false im­pris­on­ment, and a stint of about 14 months end­ing in April 2014.</p>
    <p>FBI video­tapes made of his jail­house con­fes­sions showed Lit­tle, in blue prison scrubs and grey knit cap, some­times ap­pear­ing be­mused or smil­ing as he re­counted the cir­cum­stances of the killings.</p>
    <p>He had been in­car­cer­ated at a state prison in Lan­caster, Cal­i­for­nia, north of Los Angeles, but died early on Wed­nes­day morn­ing at an out­side hos­pi­tal, the state Depart­ment of Correction­s and Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The agency said an of­fi­cial cause of death would be de­ter­mined by the county med­i­cal ex­am­iner’s of­fice.</p>
