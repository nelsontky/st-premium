    <p>Sev­eral large com­pa­nies are help­ing small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) stay afloat as the coro­n­avirus out­break con­tin­ues to take a toll on their fi­nances and op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tives in­volve pro­vid­ing much-needed re­lief and train­ing to firms at a time when some gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance is ta­per­ing off as the econ­omy grad­u­ally re­opens.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can soft­ware com­pany Sales­force has part­nered the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion to hand out $960,000 in cash grants to el­i­gi­ble SMEs. The pro­gramme is ex­pected to ben­e­fit 120 firms, which will each re­ceive a grant of $8,000.</p>
    <p>They can use the funds for their im­me­di­ate cash-flow needs, such as rent and op­er­at­ing costs, to pay staff wages and to up­grade their skills or to dig­i­talise.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered SMEs with at least 30 per cent lo­cal share­hold­ing, an an­nual rev­enue of $150,000 to $2 mil­lion, and which em­ploy be­tween five and 50 em­ploy­ees, are el­i­gi­ble to ap­ply.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions opened last Monday and close on Dec 23. Firms can go to http://bit.ly/3mgUXu0 to find out more.</p>
    <p>Sales­force Sin­ga­pore vice-pres­i­dent and gen­eral man­ager Ce­cily Ng said it is the right time for Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses to tap the grant money to fuel growth, given that the econ­omy is be­gin­ning to re­cover.</p>
    <p>“This also presents a crit­i­cal op­por­tu­nity for larger and more es­tab­lished busi­nesses to step in and give SMEs the sup­port and re­sources they need to over­come chal­lenges posed by Covid-19 and speed busi­ness trans­for­ma­tion,” she added.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, fi­nan­cial ser­vices firm Amer­i­can Ex­press is help­ing to drive foot traf­fic back to stores by bring­ing its global Shop Small cam­paign to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Card mem­bers can get $5 cash­back when they spend at least $10 at par­tic­i­pat­ing busi­nesses from to­mor­row, for up to three times.</p>
    <p>Around 2,000 busi­nesses – at 11 Cap­i­taLand malls and in ar­eas such as Kam­pong Glam and Telok Ayer – are par­tic­i­pat­ing.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Ex­press, which has com­mit­ted US$200 mil­lion (S$268 mil­lion) world­wide for its Shop Small cam­paigns, did not dis­close how much it has set aside for the ini­tia­tive here.</p>
    <p>Mr Elroy Lim, vice-pres­i­dent and gen­eral man­ager for mer­chant ser­vices at Amer­i­can Ex­press in Sin­ga­pore, said: “While Shop Small en­cour­ages peo­ple to spend, we want them to con­sider where they spend, not how much they spend, and to place more em­pha­sis on spend­ing on lo­cal busi­nesses.”</p>
    <p>Home-grown pas­try shop Tong Heng is among the shops fea­tured in the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Gen­eral man­ager Ana Fong said Tong Heng’s main chal­lenge as a</p>
    <p>SUP­PORT LO­CAL BUSI­NESSES</p>
    <p>tra­di­tional small busi­ness has been to evolve to stay rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>The shop had to cease op­er­a­tions for three weeks dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker and was lucky that it had adopted a dig­i­tal strat­egy in re­cent years that al­lowed it to up­date cus­tomers, added Ms Fong.</p>
    <p>SMEs – gen­er­ally de­fined as com­pa­nies with an an­nual turnover of less than $100 mil­lion or fewer than 200 staff – form a sig­nif­i­cant part of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy, ac­count­ing for about 99.5 per cent of the coun­try’s en­ter­prises and 70 per cent of the work­force.</p>
    <p>Be­sides fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance and in­cen­tives for shop­pers, some com­pa­nies are help­ing SMEs rein­vent them­selves through tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>GrabFood Sin­ga­pore se­nior di­rec­tor Dilip Rousse­naly said: “Even as the econ­omy grad­u­ally re­opens, we be­lieve that the cur­rent chal­lenges faced by SMEs such as re­source lim­i­ta­tions and the lack of know-how in the dig­i­tal arena will per­sist.”</p>
    <p>Grab’s re­cent ini­tia­tives to ad­dress this dig­i­tal gap in­clude its Grab Mer­chant Academy, an on­line train­ing pro­gramme launched in Septem­ber with mod­ules for busi­nesses in ar­eas such as on­line store man­age­ment, menu op­ti­mi­sa­tion and on­line mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>Firms can ac­cess these mod­ules through the GrabMer­chant app.</p>
    <p>Ef­forts by larger com­pa­nies to of­fer a life­line to SMEs come as some gov­ern­ment as­sis­tance for these firms ta­pers off in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>Sup­port mea­sures were ear­lier ex­tended to al­low busi­nesses in sec­tors most af­fected by the Covid-19 out­break to de­fer 80 per cent of prin­ci­pal pay­ments on se­cured loans granted to them by banks or fi­nance com­pa­nies, un­til June 30 next year.</p>
    <p>Firms in other sec­tors can ap­ply to de­fer 80 per cent of such pay­ments un­til March 31 next year.</p>
    <p>Loans granted un­der En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore’s en­hanced Work­ing Cap­i­tal Loan scheme and Tem­po­rary Bridg­ing Loan Pro­gramme are also el­i­gi­ble for de­fer­ment.</p>
    <p>While Shop Small en­cour­ages peo­ple to spend, we want them to con­sider where they spend, not how much they spend, and to place more em­pha­sis on spend­ing on lo­cal busi­nesses.</p>
