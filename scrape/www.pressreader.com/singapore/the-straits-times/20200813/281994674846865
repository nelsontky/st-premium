    <p>It was a de­press­ing start to the week as news came that the global coro­n­avirus cases had pushed past 20 mil­lion on Mon­day. Worse yet, the dis­ease ap­pears to be ac­cel­er­at­ing, tak­ing six months to reach 10 mil­lion cases af­ter the first in­fec­tion was re­ported in early Jan­uary, but just 43 days to dou­ble that num­ber to 20 mil­lion. More than 746,000 peo­ple have died from Covid-19 so far. High as they are, the real fig­ures may even be higher, for ex­perts be­lieve that of­fi­cial data likely un­der­counts both in­fec­tions and deaths as some coun­tries have lim­ited test­ing ca­pac­ity. It is easy to be dis­heart­ened as the end of the pan­demic does not seem to be in sight. Some coun­tries are still go­ing through a first wave while oth­ers see resur­gences that frus­trate ef­forts to re­boot their economies. The first vac­cines are not ex­pected till the mid­dle of next year, claims made by some coun­tries notwith­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>Stud­ies have shown that hav­ing their lives dis­rupted by the pan­demic has caused anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion among peo­ple, par­tic­u­larly over finances. This is be­cause eco­nomic shut­downs to con­tain the virus have led to job losses and un­cer­tainty over em­ploy­ment. So­cial dis­tanc­ing and iso­la­tion and hav­ing to cope with new ways of do­ing things – mask wear­ing, on­line learn­ing and work­ing – have not helped. Wor­ry­ingly, sub­stance use and sui­cides have gone up. Yet, around the world, peo­ple have shown re­silience and in­ge­nu­ity in cop­ing with the many chal­lenges that the virus has brought. An Aus­tralian travel writer who had to can­cel six over­seas trips be­cause of closed bor­ders de­cided to ex­plore her own back­yard. A re­sult was an ar­ti­cle on Perth’s cul­tur­ally rich Chi­na­town that was pub­lished in a Hong Kong news­pa­per. In the Philip­pines, peo­ple have taken to on­line barter trade to get around quar­an­tine pro­to­cols, de­clut­ter or be­cause they are out of work and short of cash. Some of the barters are gad­gets for fruit and kitchen ware for face masks.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, some small busi­ness own­ers have di­ver­si­fied to keep afloat, so a provider of back­drops for events has taken on tech­ni­cal in­stal­la­tion projects and e-com­merce de­liv­er­ies to make ends meet. Stu­dents whose classes have been sus­pended have found ways to keep learn­ing. At Cor­nell Univer­sity, some stu­dents con­tin­ued to write pa­pers and do re­search. An en­vi­ron­ment and sus­tain­abil­ity ma­jor up­cy­cled cloth­ing. And dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, a polytech­nic en­gi­neer­ing stu­dent took time to learn com­puter pro­gram­ming. These stu­dents and those who take up reskilling cour­ses be­cause they have lost jobs or want to up­grade are stay­ing sharp dur­ing this pan­demic pause. Amid the gloom, there is cause for some op­ti­mism be­cause peo­ple have shown their abil­ity to rise up to the chal­lenges. It re­mains for govern­ments and so­ci­ety to help them do so, as well as to pre­pare for a bet­ter fu­ture.</p>
