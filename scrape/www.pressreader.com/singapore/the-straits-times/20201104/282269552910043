    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob has for­mally as­sented to the third Sup­ple­men­tary Sup­ply and Bud­get Ad­just­ments Bill that pro­vides for an ex­tra $8 bil­lion in Covid-19 sup­port, said Speaker Tan Chuan-Jin when Par­lia­ment sat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Bill was i ntro­duced last month and 33 MPs aired their views dur­ing a two-day de­bate.</p>
    <p>The ex­tra funds will help the Gov­ern­ment pro­vide sup­port in sec­tors most se­verely af­fected by the coro­n­avirus, in­clud­ing help­ing work­ers through the Jobs Sup­port Scheme (JSS) and Work­fare Spe­cial Pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Hal­imah said in a Face­book post that she gave her as­sent to the Bill on Mon­day. “It au­tho­rises a re­al­lo­ca­tion of ex­pen­di­ture from ar­eas with re­duced spend­ing, such as dis­rup­tions to developmen­t projects due to Covid-19,” she said. “The Bill also in­cludes some rev­enue fore­gone, but it does not re­sult in a fur­ther draw on our past re­serves be­yond what I had given in-prin­ci­ple sup­port for in March and May 2020.”</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment ap­proved an un­prece­dented four Bud­gets this year amid the Covid-19 cri­sis, amount­ing to nearly $100 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore has es­ti­mated that this sum will pre­vent the economy from con­tract­ing by a fur­ther 5.6 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct in 2020, and 4.8 per cent in 2021.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic sup­port mea­sures will also cush­ion the rise in res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate by about 1.7 per­cent­age points this year.</p>
    <p>To date, a to­tal $2.2 bil­lion in JSS pay­outs has been given out to firms in Tier One sec­tors like avi­a­tion, hospi­tal­ity and tourism. This has ben­e­fited 223,000 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Another $1.9 bil­lion has been paid out to com­pa­nies in Tier Two sec­tors, such as arts, food ser­vices and re­tail. This has ben­e­fited 317,000 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Wrap­ping up the de­bate on the</p>
    <p>Bill last month, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat high­lighted the im­por­tance of man­ag­ing Sin­ga­pore’s dual iden­tity as both city and na­tion.</p>
    <p>As a city, it must re­main open to new and ex­cit­ing ideas but as a na­tion, it has to stay united and de­fend its in­de­pen­dence, he said.</p>
    <p>Now that the coun­try is shift­ing its fo­cus to eco­nomic re­cov­ery, it needs to stay open and con­nected to the wider world, Mr Heng added.</p>
    <p>In her Face­book post on Mon­day, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah said the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion has largely sta­bilised, with the num­ber of cases now un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Even so, Sin­ga­pore is still in the midst of bat­tling the virus, she added.</p>
    <p>She said: “With my as­sent to the Bill to­day, I hope the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue its fo­cus on sup­port­ing our peo­ple and busi­nesses through these tur­bu­lent times.”</p>
