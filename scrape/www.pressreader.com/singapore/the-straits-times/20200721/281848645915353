    <p>GUWA­HATI/DHAKA • In­tense rain and floods in the In­dian state of As­sam have killed at least 84 peo­ple and dis­placed more than 2.75 mil­lion since May, the author­i­ties said yes­ter­day, as they tried to col­lect the bod­ies of nine rare rhi­nos drowned in the past 10 days.</p>
    <p>Res­cue teams were fac­ing a dou­ble chal­lenge of ris­ing flood waters amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic as vil­lagers driven from their homes hud­dled in shel­ters.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard to en­force so­cial dis­tanc­ing when peo­ple are be­ing or­dered to move away from the ris­ing waters,” said Mr Sang­hami­tra Sanyal, a mem­ber of the north-east­ern state’s flood man­age­ment force. “We’re urg­ing peo­ple to at least cover their mouth and nose with a piece of clean cloth.”</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials warned that the wa­ter level in the Brahma­pu­tra River was ex­pected to rise by 11cm two weeks af­ter it burst its banks, swamp­ing more than 2,500 vil­lages.</p>
    <p>As­sam, fa­mous for its tea plan­ta­tions, is hit by flood­ing every rainy sea­son de­spite flood-con­trol ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Rights groups ac­cuse cor­rupt of­fi­cials of si­phon­ing off funds meant for flood projects, re­sult­ing i n shoddy con­struc­tion of em­bank­ments that are of­ten breached.</p>
    <p>Floods have also in­un­dated Kazi­ranga Na­tional Park, home to the world’s largest con­cen­tra­tion of one-horned rhinoceros­es, with an es­ti­mated 2,500 out of a to­tal pop­u­la­tion of some 3,000 of the an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>“Nine rhi­nos have drowned and over 100 other an­i­mals have been killed,” Mr Atul Bora, As­sam’s agri­cul­ture min­is­ter and Kazi­ranga’s mem­ber of the state Par­lia­ment, said.</p>
    <p>With the park waist-deep in wa­ter, rhi­nos, ele­phants and deer have been forced to seek refuge on roads and in hu­man set­tle­ments.</p>
    <p>Across South Asia, tor­ren­tial rain­fall dur­ing the mon­soon sea­son between June and Septem­ber typ­i­cally trig­gers floods, land­slides and light­ning strikes, with hun­dreds of peo­ple dy­ing every year.</p>
    <p>In Bangladesh and Nepal, of­fi­cials also warned that ris­ing waters would bring fur­ther flood­ing.</p>
    <p>Bangladesh­i of­fi­cials said at least 67 peo­ple had died and an­other 2.6 mil­lion had been af­fected by swollen rivers burst­ing their banks and in­un­dat­ing vil­lages over the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>Rivers were ris­ing in the coun­try’s north af­ter a fresh del­uge of rain­fall, the coun­try’s Flood Fore­cast­ing and Warn­ing Cen­tre said.</p>
    <p>A third of Bangladesh is un­der wa­ter, and the author­i­ties have warned that up to 40 per cent of the flood­prone na­tion could be in­un­dated.</p>
    <p>In Nepal, 79 peo­ple have died and 46 are miss­ing af­ter floods and land­slides, with the gov­ern­ment warn­ing of ris­ing river lev­els over the next three days.</p>
