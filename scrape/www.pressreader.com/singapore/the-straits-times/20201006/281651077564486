    <p>More than 18,000 firms have taken out loans amount­ing to over $14.5 bil­lion un­der schemes over­seen by En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG) as at Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Most of these loans were taken up be­tween March and June, when over 10,600 com­pa­nies ap­plied for some $9.4 bil­lion in loans un­der the Tem­po­rary Bridg­ing Loan Pro­gramme and the SME Work­ing Cap­i­tal Loan scheme.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, com­pa­nies made more than 5,400 ap­pli­ca­tions to de­fer prin­ci­pal pay­ments on se­cured term loans amount­ing to more than $11.5 bil­lion as at Au­gust, the Mon­e­tary Authority of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for new loans and loan mora­to­ri­ums from both com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als peaked be­tween April and June, and have since slowed.</p>
    <p>But those that con­tinue to face fi­nan­cial strain amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic will find much­needed sup­port with the ex­ten­sion of credit re­lief mea­sures an­nounced by the MAS yes­ter­day, banks said.</p>
    <p>The ta­per­ing off of new loans and mora­to­ri­ums sought since July is due to small and medi­um­sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) see­ing im­proved cash flow fol­low­ing the re­sump­tion of business and sup­port from var­i­ous re­lief mea­sures im­ple­mented to help com­pa­nies tide over the Covid-19 cri­sis, said OCBC Bank head of global com­mer­cial bank­ing Li­nus Goh.</p>
    <p>“SMEs in sev­eral industries which were harder hit, such as the travel-re­lated sec­tor as well as con­struc­tion, con­tinue to be ad­versely im­pacted and will ben­e­fit from a fur­ther ex­ten­sion of the loan mora­to­rium pro­gramme,” he added.</p>
    <p>Most bor­row­ers with vi­able business mod­els have been prompt in re­pay­ing their loans, a DBS Bank spokesman said.</p>
    <p>The bank has ap­proved close to 9,700 loans to­talling more than $5 bil­lion to SMEs through the ESG loan schemes, of which more than 8,300 loans were granted to mi­cro and small busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“We made spe­cial ef­fort to reach out to mi­cro and small en­ter­prises, as these are typ­i­cally the most un­der­served and vul­ner­a­ble of busi­nesses in an eco­nomic cri­sis,” said DBS Sin­ga­pore coun­try head Shee Tse Koon.</p>
    <p>As for in­di­vid­u­als seek­ing re­lief, MAS said around 36,000 ap­pli­ca­tions to de­fer pay­ment on prop­erty loans amount­ing to around $29 bil­lion were ap­proved as at Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of mort­gage de­fer­ments from in­di­vid­u­als has ta­pered off since the April to June peak – as at end-June, there were nearly 34,000 ap­proved ap­pli­ca­tions, an MAS spokesman said.</p>
    <p>United Overseas Bank head of group per­sonal fi­nan­cial ser­vices Jacquelyn Tan said: “While there was a spike in calls dur­ing the early days of the (debt re­lief pro­gramme), we have seen a drop of more than 50 per cent in new loan de­fer­ral ap­pli­ca­tions in the past two months.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, more than 8,100 ap­pli­ca­tions have been made to con­vert per­sonal un­se­cured credit, such as credit card bal­ances, to lower-in­ter­est term loans.</p>
