        Life Food & Drink | The Sunday Times Sunday, July 19, 2020 | C16 DRUNKEN COCKLES What: Restaurant chain Putien’s drunken cockles ($10.90++, left) are served cold, drenched in garlic sauce and topped with plenty of garlic and chilli. I like it with a dollop of Putien’s housemade signature Spice Mum chilli sauce as well.
Cockle supply from Malaysia is currently disrupted due to the pandemic. Otherwise, the dish is usually available all year long.
Putien outlets including Ion Orchard, Jurong Point and VivoCity

Shaped like a cockle, this fried Pisang dessert ($11 for five pieces, left) features a sweet potato and tapioca skin filled with banana. It has an eco angle too. The ingredient­s are repurposed from the cocktails served at seafood-centric South-east
Asian restaurant and bar Laut.
17 Stanley Street; open: 5 to 10.30pm, Mondays to Saturdays, closed on Sundays
Call 8878-8018 or go to www.lautcollec­tive.com.sg COCKLES BIBIMBAP What: Not the usual bibimbap mixed with meat and vegetables. A dish of marinated boiled cockles topped with chillies, sliced raw garlic and seaweed is part of
Korean restaurant SBCD Tofu House’s cockles bibimbap set
($30). I ordered this to try at home and the cockles were fragrant from the marinade and sesame oil.
It is available for delivery and includes a choice of small soontofu soup and rice.
SBCD Korean Tofu House outlets at 01-114 Millenia Walk, 9 Raffles Boulevard; and
B1-01 Tanjong Pagar Centre, 7 Wallich Street; open: Millenia Walk: noon to 3pm, 6 to 9pm daily; Tanjong Pagar Centre: 11.30 to 3pm, 5 to 9pm (weekdays), 11.30am to 9pm (weekends)
Islandwide delivery at sbcdkorean­tofuhouse.oddle.me Where: Info: PHOTOS: DAMIAN OOI, EUNICE QUEK, MRS PHO, PUTIEN Mooncake sellers target online sales in absence of big fairs events – has set up an e-commerce site (mooncakefa­ir.com) which goes live next month for preorders.
The company handles storage at a food and beverage central warehouse, distributi­on in temperatur­econtrolle­d food vehicles and delivery to customers.
The site is also a one-stop shop for customers to combine purchases from different brand partners to get bulk discounts.
Ms Lyn Lee, 46, spokesman for Sinpopo Fairs, says the target of getting 20 brands on board has already been met.
Expect notable names i n the mooncake scene such as Home’s Favourite, Tai Chong Kok and The Peninsula Hong Kong, as well as offerings from hotels such as The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore and Shangri-La Hotel, Singapore.
Ms Lee, who is also the founder of Awfully Chocolate, says: “When it became clear that physical mooncake fairs would be cancelled or downsized, we decided to make the best out of a difficult situation.”
She adds: “With the situation now, we doubt sampling will be allowed at the physical fairs even if they can go on with all the safe Eunice Quek Food Correspond­ent This year’s mooncake season is likely to be a more muted affair as businesses shift their focus to online sales.
Even though the Mid-Autumn Festival falls on Oct 1, industry players are not hopeful that large-scale mooncake fairs in malls – which usually draw huge crowds out to sample the baked and snowskin treats – will happen in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Many are expecting poorer sales and are trying to attract customers with new flavours and by dangling discounts.
The Sunday Times understand­s that the highly anticipate­d annual mooncake fairs by Takashimay­a Department Store and Tangs Singapore are likely to shift online.
A smaller number of vendors may be allowed to retail mooncakes within the store premises. However, the number of visitors is likely to be restricted.
To support fellow mooncake retailers, Sinpopo Fairs – the sister company of chocolate cake chain Awfully Chocolate that organises malade Pantry’s mooncake collection for pre-orders made by Aug 16.
Over at Regent Singapore, all four- or eight-piece mooncake box purchases will be discounted by 30 per cent till Aug 23, while Grand Hyatt Singapore – which starts its e-store (store.grandhyatt­singapore. com) next week – is offering earlybird discounts of up to 35 per cent. Corporate bulk purchases get up to 50 per cent off.
For housewife Jill Phua, 48, the shift to buying mooncakes online is a convenient option.
She says: “I do enjoy the mooncake fairs and will miss going around to sample the products.
“However, I’ve become used to ordering food online during this period and now I can send mooncakes directly to my family and friends.” management rules.”
Meanwhile, Mr Robert Han, general manager of Peony Jade restaurant, is sticking to two new flavours this time – flaky orh nee “cha cha”, a spin on the bubur cha cha dessert; and chocolate durian snowskin.
He says: “When customers cannot sample your products, they will stick to what they know and like, such as durian, orh nee or the traditiona­l baked ones. If you do something too exotic or use too many flavours, it cannot click with customers.”
He starts taking pre-orders from today via Peony Jade’s website and Oddle, offering early-bird discounts of up to 25 per cent. But his brand’s presence in malls will be reduced by half. Previously, he ran booths at about eight malls. Local flavours are turning up in quite a few other creations.
New mochi-snowskin hybrid mooncakes from restaurant chain Swensen’s include flavours such as salted gula melaka and kueh salat, while Crowne Plaza Changi Airport’s assorted snowskin selection includes pandan kaya and orh nee.
For those looking to splurge, Goodwood Park Hotel offers a 16.5cm-wide baked mooncake ($108 nett) with white lotus seed paste and 12 salted egg yolks – launched in conjunctio­n with its 120th anniversar­y. Pre-orders start next week.
Still, many businesses are expecting poorer sales this year and some are off to a slow start.
Mr Daniel Tay of Old Seng Choong – known for its cookies with local flavours and traditiona­l bakes – has noticed a drop of at least 50 per cent in volume from interested parties this year.
Aside from being part of Mooncakefa­ir.com and having his own e-store, Mr Tay is also planning to sell via Facebook Live sessions.
A Crystal Jade spokesman says people have lower budgets this year and sales have been “lukewarm”.
He adds: “Reduced demand for corporate gifting has lowered our projected production to about 50 per cent of the usual volume.”
To encourage early purchases, many are offering attractive discounts.
Pan Pacific Singapore’s Hai Tien Lo restaurant is giving 25 per cent off advance orders till July 31, while there is a 20 per cent discount (payment via Mastercard) for The Mar- PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
