    <p>MADRID • Three people died in Spain and troops res­cued driv­ers trapped by snow as Storm Filom­ena caused travel chaos across the coun­try, with Madrid see­ing the heav­i­est snow­fall in decades.</p>
    <p>The air­port in Madrid was closed and skiers glided down the Gran Via, nor­mally one of the busiest streets in the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>A man and a woman who were trav­el­ling in a car drowned af­ter a river burst its banks near Malaga, south­ern Spain, and a home­less per­son froze to death in the east­ern city of Calatayud, the au­thor­i­ties said.</p>
    <p>“Let’s avoid travel and fol­low the in­struc­tions of the emer­gency ser­vices,” Span­ish Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez tweeted. “Let’s be ex­tremely care­ful in the face of the storm #Filom­ena.”</p>
    <p>Aena, which con­trols the coun­try’s air­ports, said Madrid’s Bara­jas air­port would re­main closed for a sec­ond day yes­ter­day, de­scrib­ing the sit­u­a­tion as “ex­cep­tional and most likely his­toric”.</p>
    <p>It said at least 50 flights to Madrid, Malaga, Tener­ife and Ceuta, a Span­ish ter­ri­tory in North Africa, had been can­celled.</p>
    <p>Apart from Madrid, the re­gions of Aragon, Va­len­cia, Castilla-La Man­cha and Cat­alo­nia were the worst hit by the snow­storms.</p>
    <p>The State Metere­o­log­i­cal Agency said it was the big­gest snow­fall in Madrid since 1971, while Mr Jose Miguel Vi­nas, a me­te­o­rol­o­gist from Span­ish Na­tional Ra­dio, said that be­tween 25cm and 50cm fell in Madrid, mak­ing it the heav­i­est snow­fall since 1963.</p>
    <p>The snow dis­rupted traf­fic on</p>
    <p>nearly 400 roads, and high-speed trains be­tween Madrid and Va­len­cia were can­celled.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of mo­torists were stranded across the coun­try. Soldiers worked to reach driv­ers stranded for hours on roads around Madrid.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties sus­pended bus ser­vices and rub­bish col­lec­tion ser­vices in the city.</p>
    <p>Ms Pa­tri­cia Man­zanares, who had been trapped in her car on the M-40 mo­tor­way in Madrid since 7pm last Fri­day, told RTVE tele­vi­sion: “I have been stuck here with­out wa­ter or any other help.”</p>
    <p>The head of the Madrid re­gion’s emer­gency ser­vice, Mr Car­los Novillo, ap­pealed for people not to go out in their cars.</p>
    <p>“We have worked in­tensely. We have res­cued 1,000 ve­hi­cles. We</p>
    <p>ask for pa­tience, we will reach you all,” he said.</p>
    <p>Madrid and four other re­gions were on red alert yes­ter­day as more heavy snow­falls were fore­cast un­til at least to­day, ac­cord­ing to the</p>
    <p>State Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Agency.</p>
    <p>Storm Filom­ena has also brought in­tense rain and high winds to the Ca­nary Is­lands as well as Spain’s south­ern coast.</p>

Four other re&#xAD;gions in Spain were also on red alert yes&#xAD;ter&#xAD;day, with more heavy snow&#xAD;falls fore&#xAD;cast.</p>
