    <p>Bi­lat­eral agree­ments that Singapore signed have not jeop­ar­dised job op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said. He also as­sured Sin­ga­pore­ans that there are proper chan­nels in place for the Govern­ment to mon­i­tor and take ac­tion against dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Singapore’s bi­lat­eral agree­ments with other coun­tries have not jeop­ar­dised job op­por­tu­ni­ties for its ci­ti­zens, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said yes­ter­day. In fact, they have opened doors to bet­ter jobs.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to crit­i­cisms about how free trade agree­ments or com­pre­hen­sive eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion agree­ments had caused Singapore to “sign away im­por­tant pro­tec­tion for Sin­ga­porean (jobs)”, Mr Heng said that such state­ments were to­tally false.</p>
    <p>“In fact, what we are do­ing is to en­sure that it cre­ates bet­ter jobs for Sin­ga­pore­ans,” he said.</p>
    <p>These agree­ments can help draw in in­vest­ments from abroad and, in turn, pave the way for Sin­ga­porean firms to in­vest overseas and be fairly treated there, he said. “This, in turn, cre­ates jobs back home.”</p>
    <p>He stressed that the agree­ments do not mean that Singapore was ne­go­ti­at­ing away its rights to de­ter­mine who be­comes a ci­ti­zen or a per­ma­nent res­i­dent here, or who gets awarded an em­ploy­ment pass.</p>
    <p>It is Singapore’s sov­er­eign right to de­cide on these is­sues, he added.</p>
    <p>But Mr Heng ac­knowl­edged that some may feel there are too many for­eign­ers re­sid­ing in Singapore. He cited res­i­dents’ con­cerns about the large num­ber of ex­pa­tri­ates at Changi Busi­ness Park – which is part of East Coast GRC where Mr Heng is an MP.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing a vir­tual con­stituency event, he ex­plained the rea­son for this was that Singapore was still grow­ing ex­per­tise in cer­tain sec­tors, and that the Repub­lic was fac­ing a short­age of man­power in tech­nol­ogy and in risk man­age­ment ar­eas.</p>
    <p>These ar­eas were ones where the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Singapore (MAS) also saw scope for im­prove­ment, when it re­cently said it would en­gage fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions in an ef­fort to grow the Sin­ga­porean core of their work­force.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng also as­sured Sin­ga­pore­ans that there are proper chan­nels in place – such as the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work – for the Govern­ment to mon­i­tor and take ac­tion against com­pa­nies which have dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>He cited a group of 47 em­ploy­ers who were placed on the Min­istry of Man­power’s (MOM) watch list for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>MOM had said then that these em­ploy­ers will have their em­ploy­ment pass ap­pli­ca­tions for for­eign hires closely scru­ti­nised, and those which are re­cal­ci­trant or un­co­op­er­a­tive will have their work pass priv­i­leges cut back.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing yes­ter­day’s event, which fo­cused on sup­port for work­ers and busi­nesses dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, Mr Heng said that more funds are be­ing pumped into train­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>In April, MAS had an­nounced a $125 mil­lion sup­port pack­age to boost ca­pa­bil­i­ties in the fi­nan­cial ser­vice and fin­tech sec­tors amid the cur­rent eco­nomic slump.</p>
    <p>Such train­ing was im­por­tant, he said, as the skills which will be needed in a post-Covid-19 econ­omy will be dif­fer­ent from what they are to­day.</p>
    <p>“It is rain­ing very heav­ily now,” he said. But even as peo­ple seek shel­ter dur­ing this eco­nomic storm, they should also take the op­por­tu­nity to im­prove them­selves. “So that when the rain stops, we can run,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter, was speak­ing at the “East Coast Con­ver­sa­tions” vir­tual event on how Sin­ga­porean work­ers and com­pa­nies can ben­e­fit from the re­cently an­nounced mea­sures to help tide the econ­omy over the Covid-19 lull.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng’s fel­low East Coast GRC MPs – Mr Tan Kiat How, Ms Jes­sica Tan, Dr Ma­liki Os­man and Ms Ch­eryl Chan – also took part in the event, which was streamed live on Face­book.</p>
