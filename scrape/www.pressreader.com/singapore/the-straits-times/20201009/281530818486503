    <p>The Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases is set to en­rol hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients to take part in Sin­ga­pore’s first phase three mon­o­clonal an­ti­body trial. The cen­tre aims to re­cruit 100 lo­cal pa­tients as part of Ac­tiv-3, a global trial that be­gan in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients in the study will get ei­ther the an­ti­body or a placebo. Both groups will also be given the an­tivi­ral drug remde­sivir. Pa­tients may also be given the steroid dex­am­etha­sone – a drug which broadly sup­presses the body’s im­mune re­sponse and can be used to treat se­vere asthma and se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions – if the doc­tor deems it suit­able.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients here can now opt to take part in Sin­ga­pore’s first phase three mon­o­clonal an­ti­body trial.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) said that as of last Tues­day, it was ready to en­rol its first pa­tients – though none had been re­cruited as at yes­ter­day af­ter­noon – and aimed to en­rol a to­tal of 100 lo­cal pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is only the third coun­try to start re­cruit­ing pa­tients as part of a global trial called Ac­tiv-3, which started in Au­gust and aims to re­cruit 1,000 pa­tients glob­ally. As at yes­ter­day, 260 pa­tients were re­cruited in the global trial, most of them from Den­mark and the United States.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiv-3 is es­ti­mated to be com­pleted by year’s end or in Jan­uary, so Sin­ga­pore’s con­tri­bu­tion will de­pend on how long it takes for the trial to re­cruit the study num­ber and how many pa­tients are el­i­gi­ble for the trial here, The Straits Times was told yes­ter­day by As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor David Lye, senior con­sul­tant and di­rec­tor of the In­fec­tious Dis­ease Re­search and Train­ing Of­fice at NCID.</p>
    <p>The mon­o­clonal an­ti­body was de­vel­oped by Amer­i­can phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Eli Lilly. It is a pu­ri­fied, highly ac­tive an­ti­body that tar­gets the spike pro­tein of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiv-3 en­rols Covid-19 pa­tients who are sick enough to be hos­pi­talised. Pa­tients in the study will get ei­ther the an­ti­body or a placebo. Both groups will also be given the an­tivi­ral drug remde­sivir.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients may also be given the steroid dex­am­etha­sone – a drug which broadly sup­presses the body’s im­mune re­sponse and can be used to treat se­vere asthma and se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions – if the doc­tor deems it suit­able.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, NCID will be en­rolling pa­tients with pneu­mo­nia or high-risk pa­tients older than 45 with chronic health prob­lems such as di­a­betes or high blood pres­sure. Healthy in­di­vid­u­als will not be in­cluded in the trial.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal pa­tients in the Ac­tiv-3 trial will be mon­i­tored for 90 days and seen daily for the first five days. This is to ob­serve pos­si­ble side ef­fects and de­ter­mine how they are re­spond­ing to treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, only one an­ti­body is in­ves­ti­gated in the trial. How­ever, a US Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health re­view com­mit­tee is ac­tively con­sid­er­ing two to three other mon­o­clonal an­ti­bod­ies, Prof Lye said. This means that Ac­tiv-3 may con­tinue un­til enough ef­fec­tive mon­o­clonal an­ti­bod­ies have been found.</p>
    <p>ST re­ported on Tues­day that one of the two mon­o­clonal an­ti­bod­ies in the cock­tail used to treat US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump for Covid-19 was de­vel­oped us­ing blood sam­ples from three pa­tients in Sin­ga­pore. NCID has clar­i­fied that Ac­tiv-3 has no con­nec­tion to that treat­ment cock­tail, which was de­vel­oped by US biotech­nol­ogy firm Re­gen­eron.</p>
    <p>These mon­o­clonal an­ti­bod­ies are ac­ces­si­ble only through tri­als, which will de­ter­mine if they are both safe and ef­fec­tive. They are not part of ap­proved treat­ments.</p>
    <p>This is why Sin­ga­pore is keen to be part of this trial, so that if there are more se­ri­ous cases of lo­cal Covid-19 in­fec­tion, they can be treated, Prof Lye ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiv-3 is one of the few treat­ment tri­als in which Sin­ga­pore has par­tic­i­pated.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the NCID – in part­ner­ship with the US Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health – took part in three adap­tive Covid-19 treat­ment tri­als (ACTT) for three dif­fer­ent drugs.</p>
    <p>The first trial, known as ACTT1, re­cruited 1,062 pa­tients glob­ally, with Sin­ga­pore con­tribut­ing 16 pa­tients. It has now been com­pleted.</p>
    <p>ACTT1 proved that the an­tivi­ral drug remde­sivir is ef­fec­tive in im­prov­ing re­cov­ery time and re­duc­ing mor­tal­ity in pa­tients with low oxy­gen flow. The Health Sci­ences Author­ity has granted con­di­tional ap­proval to in­fec­tious dis­ease spe­cial­ists giv­ing remde­sivir to se­ri­ously ill Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Remde­sivir gets in­side the cell and blocks the virus from re­pro­duc­ing, while an­ti­bod­ies bind to the virus and stop it from en­ter­ing the cell.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond trial, or ACTT2, re­cruited 1,033 pa­tients glob­ally, with Sin­ga­pore con­tribut­ing 44 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>ACTT2 stud­ied whether baric­i­tinib, a drug used to treat rheuma­toid arthri­tis, would be ef­fec­tive in treat­ing Covid-19. The full re­sults are due to be out in a month.</p>
    <p>The third trial, or ACTT3, is on­go­ing, and stud­ies if beta in­ter­feron – a drug used to treat mul­ti­ple scle­ro­sis – would be ef­fec­tive in treat­ing Covid-19.</p>
    <p>As at yes­ter­day, ACTT3 has re­cruited 488 pa­tients glob­ally, with Sin­ga­pore con­tribut­ing four pa­tients, given the low num­ber of ac­tive cases in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>ACTT tri­als take place at four sites in Sin­ga­pore: the NCID, Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal, Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal and Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal.</p>
