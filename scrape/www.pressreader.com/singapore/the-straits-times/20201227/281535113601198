    <p>Amid grow­ing con­cerns about a new strain of the coro­n­avirus sur­fac­ing here, ex­perts have said mea­sures now in place, such as wear­ing masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing, are suf­fi­cient to com­bat its spread.</p>
    <p>Two new strains of the coro­n­avirus have been dis­cov­ered, in Britain and South Africa. Malaysia’s Health Min­istry has also iden­ti­fied a new strain from sam­ples taken in Sabah state.</p>
    <p>The new B117 strain in Britain is re­port­edly 70 per cent more con­ta­gious, but has not shown signs of be­ing more lethal or se­vere.</p>
    <p>The first case of this strain here was recorded last Wed­nes­day, in a 17-year-old Sin­ga­porean girl who had re­turned from Britain.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong from the Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School said the cur­rent mea­sures were suf­fi­cient even with the new strains.</p>
    <p>“I do not think there is a need for stricter mea­sures. Even if the mu­ta­tion in­creases the like­li­hood of spread, the modes of trans­mis­sion re­main the same.</p>
    <p>“Con­trol mea­sures are tai­lored to the mode of trans­mis­sion, not the like­li­hood of spread,” he said.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tious dis­eases spe­cial­ist Leong Hoe Nam agreed the cur­rent safety mea­sures in Sin­ga­pore were ad­e­quate against the new strains.</p>
    <p>“The virus has a weak­ness. It must in­fect via con­tact or droplet. Block those two ef­fec­tively and the virus is ren­dered harm­less.”</p>
    <p>Not­ing the var­i­ous strin­gent mea­sures in Sin­ga­pore like SafeEn­try, masks, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and swab tests, Dr Leong said these should be con­sid­ered not as separate meth­ods but mul­ti­ple lay­ers of mea­sures work­ing to­gether. He added that air­port staff should be vig­i­lant and strin­gent, fol­low­ing the dis­cov­ery of the new strains.</p>
    <p>From last Wed­nes­day, all Sin­ga­pore Air­lines cabin crew mem­bers work­ing on flights from Lon­don have had to wear N95 masks and pro­tec­tive over­alls amid grow­ing con­cerns about the new strain of the virus. Prior to this, cabin crew had been wear­ing gog­gles, gloves and sur­gi­cal masks on all flights.</p>
    <p>Dis­cussing how the new strains af­fected vac­ci­na­tion plans, Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), said it may now be important for more Sin­ga­pore­ans to get vac­ci­nated against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in a video in­ter­view with The Straits Times last Thurs­day, on its daily on­line talk show The Big Story, Prof Teo said: “This is the only way we can con­tinue to en­sure that the com­mu­nity as a whole is pro­tected.”</p>
    <p>In­stead of aim­ing to get 80 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion here vac­ci­nated against Covid-19, “we may be now look­ing at 90 per cent or even higher”, he said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Hsu Li Yang from the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health said the vac­cine would still pro­tect against the new Covid-19 strains.</p>
    <p>“The risk of mu­ta­tion for coro­n­aviruses is far lower than viruses such as flu. Thus far, the new strains have not mu­tated to the ex­tent that vac­cines are not able to pro­tect against them.”</p>
    <p>When asked if vac­ci­na­tion should be made com­pul­sory, Prof Ooi dis­agreed and said there should in­stead be “clear dis­sem­i­na­tion of facts and in­for­ma­tion about vac­cines and how they work, as well as a di­a­logue be­tween the health au­thor­i­ties and the Sin­ga­pore pop­u­la­tion to ad­dress any con­cerns on Covid-19 vac­cines and myths”.</p>
