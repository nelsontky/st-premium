    <p>•</p>
    <p>Manch­ester City an­nounced the sign­ing of Por­tuguese cen­tre-back Ruben Dias on a sixyear deal from Ben­fica on Tues­day, in the hope of solv­ing the de­fen­sive prob­lems that have dogged Pep Guardi­ola’s side over the past year.</p>
    <p>Ben­fica on Sun­day con­firmed they had reached an agree­ment to sell Dias for €68 mil­lion (S$109 mil­lion) plus an ex­tra €3.6 mil­lion in po­ten­tial bonuses, with Nico­las Ota­mendi head­ing in the op­po­site di­rec­tion for €15 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“To have the op­por­tu­nity to join a club like Manch­ester City is a fan­tas­tic op­por­tu­nity for me and one I couldn’t turn down,” said Dias, 23, who has 19 in­ter­na­tional caps, in a City state­ment.</p>
    <p>“Their suc­cess speaks for it­self. They have been the dom­i­nant team in Eng­land over the last few years, play­ing an at­tack­ing brand of foot­ball which I feel suits my own game.</p>
    <p>“It is re­ally ex­cit­ing to be part of such a talen­ted squad and to play for a world-class man­ager like Pep Guardi­ola, who has a proven track record of de­vel­op­ing young play­ers like my­self.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve I can im­prove here, and I will give ev­ery­thing to be suc­cess­ful and win ti­tles.”</p>
    <p>Dias be­comes City’s third sign­ing of the sum­mer af­ter cen­tre-back Nathan Ake from Bournemout­h and Span­ish winger Fer­ran Tor­res.</p>
    <p>The need for more de­fen­sive re­in­force­ments was ev­i­dent as City were thrashed 5-2 at home by Le­ices­ter on Sun­day – the first time a Guardi­ola side con­ceded five in his distinguis­hed man­age­rial ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“Ruben is a player we have ad­mired for some time and we have been im­pressed with how he has pro­gressed at Ben­fica,” City direc­tor of foot­ball Txiki Be­giris­tain said.</p>
    <p>“He has de­vel­oped into a real leader and as a de­fender, he has all the at­tributes we are look­ing for. He is strong in the air, good in onev-one sit­u­a­tions... so we are con­fi­dent he can thrive in our sys­tem.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Dias be­comes just the lat­est in a string of ex­pen­sive de­fen­sive sign­ings, to­talling over €450 mil­lion, since Guardi­ola was ap­pointed in 2016.</p>
    <p>De­spite huge price tags, John Stones, Joao Cancelo and Ben­jamin Mendy are not first-team reg­u­lars, while Ake has been signed as backup for Aymeric La­porte.</p>
    <p>Ota­mendi, 32, won sev­eral ma­jor hon­ours dur­ing his time at the Eti­had, in­clud­ing two Pre­mier League ti­tles, and made more than 200 ap­pear­ances in all com­pe­ti­tions in five sea­sons.</p>
    <p>The Ar­gen­tinian in­ter­na­tional has pre­vi­ously played in Por­tu­gal, turn­ing out for Ben­fica’s bit­ter ri­vals Porto be­tween 2010 and 2014.</p>
