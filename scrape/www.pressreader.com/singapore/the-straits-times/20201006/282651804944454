    <p>• Ja­pan’s most fa­mous fash­ion de­signer Kenzo Takada, founder of the global Kenzo brand, died in the French cap­i­tal on Sun­day aged 81 af­ter con­tract­ing the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Tributes have poured i n for Takada, the first Ja­panese de­signer to de­camp to Paris and known es­pe­cially for his sig­na­ture flo­ral prints.</p>
    <p>“To­day, his op­ti­mism, zest for life and gen­eros­ity con­tinue to be pil­lars of our Mai­son (House). He will be greatly missed and al­ways re­mem­bered,” the Kenzo fash­ion house he founded wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>He “helped to write a new page in fash­ion, at the con­flu­ence of t h e E a s t a n d t h e We s t ” , s a i d Mr Ralph Toledano of the Haute</p>
    <p>Cou­ture Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Takada’s death comes 50 years af­ter he launched his first col­lec­tion in Paris, which he has made his home.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery wall, ev­ery sky and ev­ery passer-by helps me build my col­lec­tions,” he once said of the city.</p>
    <p>He re­tired from fash­ion in 1999, six years af­ter sell­ing his brand to lux­ury con­glom­er­ate LVMH, and ded­i­cated his time to one-off projects in­clud­ing a de­sign col­lec­tion at the start of this year.</p>
    <p>Born in 1939 into a fam­ily of hote­liers, Takada chose to study art not cater­ing, be­com­ing a star pupil at Toyko’s Bunka Gakuen col­lege, where he took the top prize. He went on to work for Sanai, a ma­jor chain of fash­ion shops, but dreamt of Paris.</p>
    <p>He ar­rived in Paris in the win­ter of 1965 hardly speak­ing any French, and the only job he could get was in a poo­dle par­lour.</p>
    <p>In 1970, how­ever, he took the lease of premises in the Ga­lerie Vivi­enne, then a rather down-at-heel shop­ping ar­cade.</p>
    <p>His first show us­ing ama­teur mod­els to save money was held there. One of only 20 peo­ple in­vited in­cluded the editor-in-chief of Elle mag­a­zine, who liked the col­lec­tion so much she ran it on the front cover.</p>
    <p>He be­came a name al­most overnight and went on to re­vi­talise the knitwear in­dus­try with his con­tem­po­rary in­ter­pre­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>By the early 1980s, when other Ja­panese de­sign­ers were mak­ing their way in Paris, Takada was al­ready well es­tab­lished on the French fash­ion scene.</p>
    <p>His first men’s col­lec­tion was pre­sented in 1983 and his first per­fume, Kenzo Kenzo, in 1988.</p>
    <p>Takada’s ro­man­tic style, with its eclec­tic mix of colour, touches of ex­oti­cism, eth­nic prints and folksy em­broi­dery, suited the mood of the 1970s but adapted well to the sharper-look­ing 1980s and 1990s.</p>
    <p>He guarded his pri­vacy by build­ing him­self a house in the coun­try in the very heart of Paris, com­plete with authen­tic tea pavil­ion and a pool of carp.</p>
    <p>“A de­signer with im­mense tal­ent, he gave colour and light their right­ful place in fash­ion,” said Paris mayor Anne Hi­dalgo on Twit­ter. “Paris is to­day mourn­ing one of its sons.”</p>
