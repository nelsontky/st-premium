    <p>Meet-the-Peo­ple Ses­sions (MPS) will be al­lowed to re­sume from to­day, with pre­cau­tions taken such as a cap of 50 peo­ple or fewer on the crowd size, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency said.</p>
    <p>The num­ber will de­pend on the size of each MPS venue, it added. The crowd size com­prises all peo­ple present, in­clud­ing MPs, ac­tivists and res­i­dents, as well as those in the wait­ing area and queue.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP) MPs told The Straits Times they will be im­ple­ment­ing ad­di­tional safety mea­sures for their MPS from this week.</p>
    <p>West Coast GRC MP Foo Mee Har said th­ese mea­sures could in­clude us­ing nearby void decks as wait­ing ar­eas, and lim­it­ing the num­ber of peo­ple inside her branch to 30, in­clud­ing the MP and vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>“For the MPS lo­ca­tion at Block 32 Te­ban Gar­dens where space is avail­able, we will con­duct ‘out­door’ MPS, a prac­tice we started pre-cir­cuit breaker in March this year,” Ms Foo said.</p>
    <p>“We will be en­forc­ing strict safe dis­tanc­ing, in­stal­la­tion of plastic shields, SafeEn­try check-in with tem­per­a­ture screen­ing and health dec­la­ra­tion. In­di­vid­u­als on stay­home no­tice, quar­an­tine or­der or who are ill will be asked to re­turn home.”</p>
    <p>The Work­ers’ Party’s Ger­ald Giam, an MP for Alju­nied GRC, said in a cir­cu­lar to Be­dok Reser­voirPung­gol res­i­dents last Friday that his ses­sions with con­stituents would re­sume from Wednesday.</p>
    <p>He told ST that his team – com­pris­ing about 15 vol­un­teers at each ses­sion – will be us­ing plastic shields, as well as tak­ing mea­sures to en­sure the res­i­dents’ safety.</p>
    <p>For one thing, res­i­dents will be able to go home af­ter reg­is­ter­ing, and will be called when their turn ap­proaches. Pri­or­ity will also be given to el­derly res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>Mr Giam said he has pro­vided res­i­dents with tele­phone and What­sApp num­bers for them to seek as­sis­tance through­out the week, but is look­ing for­ward to as­sist­ing them in per­son.</p>
    <p>“While I have been get­ting a lot of re­quests for as­sis­tance over elec­tronic chan­nels, I re­alise that other res­i­dents may not be com­fort­able us­ing th­ese chan­nels and would pre­fer face-to-face meet­ings,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I am con­cerned that th­ese res­i­dents may not have been get­ting the help they need, which is why I am look­ing for­ward to as­sist­ing them at our phys­i­cal MPS.”</p>
    <p>A PAP spokesman said the party’s branches will ad­here to safety guide­lines, such as mak­ing sure there is suf­fi­cient phys­i­cal space to al­low safe dis­tanc­ing be­tween in­di­vid­u­als and groups. Tem­per­a­ture tak­ing and the use of SafeEn­try for check­ing in will also be re­quired.</p>
    <p>“Wher­ever pos­si­ble, MPS cases can con­tinue to be ad­dressed... via phone, on­line or e-mail,” he said.</p>
    <p>MPSes have been largely vir­tual af­fairs in re­cent months be­cause of Covid-19, and re­mained that way when they re­sumed af­ter the July 10 Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Given that it is a public hol­i­day to­day, the rules will kick in the fol­low­ing week for con­stituen­cies that hold an MPS on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Tampines GRC MP Des­mond Choo said he will re­sume his ses­sions for Tampines Changkat res­i­dents next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The PAP MP said his team will be ob­serv­ing safety mea­sures closely, such as con­duct­ing in­ter­views from be­hind acrylic screens. “The crux is also to man­age num­bers so that we do not have big crowds. For ex­am­ple, we will be con­tin­u­ing e-MPS and hav­ing pri­or­ity queues to pre­vent crowd build-ups.”</p>
