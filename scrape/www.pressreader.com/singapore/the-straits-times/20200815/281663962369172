    <p>No new Covid-19 cases in the com­mu­nity were re­ported yes­ter­day, for the first time since June 1.</p>
    <p>But a one-year-old boy was among the four im­ported Covid-19 pa­tients, said the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>The boy, an In­dian national and a de­pen­dant’s pass holder, ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia. He was asymp­to­matic when tested on ar­rival but on Wed­nes­day, he tested pos­i­tive. An­other de­pen­dant’s pass holder, also an In­dian national who had re­turned from In­dia, was among the im­ported pa­tients. The last two im­ported cases ar­rived from In­dia on Aug 2. They are work pass hold­ers who are cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said all of them were on 14-day stay­home no­tices on ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 79 new Covid-19 pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 55,580.</p>
    <p>Six clus­ters in dor­mi­to­ries were closed as the dorms have been cleared by the in­ter-agency task force, and now house only re­cov­ered in­di­vid­u­als and those who have tested neg­a­tive re­cently for Covid-19 in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 313 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 51,034 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 79 pa­tients re­mained in hospi­tal yes­ter­day, the low­est num­ber since at least March 24, when the Gov­ern­ment said the com­mu­nity iso­la­tion fa­cil­ity at D’Re­sort NTUC was op­er­a­tional.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients who were clin­i­cally well enough to be dis­charged from med­i­cal care but still tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 were moved from hos­pi­tals to the fa­cil­ity for iso­la­tion and care. Some 401 Covid-19 pa­tients were in hospi­tal on March 24, in­clud­ing 17 in in­ten­sive care. Yes­ter­day, 4,425 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
