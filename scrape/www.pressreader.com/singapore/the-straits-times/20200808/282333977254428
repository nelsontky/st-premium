    <p>In­vestors dumped Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore’s shares yes­ter­day, a day af­ter the listed casino op­er­a­tor posted its worst-ever quar­terly per­for­mance and did not de­clare an in­terim div­i­dend for the first half, de­spite sit­ting on a huge net cash pile of about $3.3 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>That, ac­cord­ing to sev­eral an­a­lysts, was be­low their ex­pec­ta­tions, even as the board said it “recog­nises share­hold­ers’ in­ter­ests” and “has in­ten­tions to de­clare a fi­nal div­i­dend for full-year 2020, if nec­es­sary, out of its re­tained profit”. The com­pany had is­sued an in­terim div­i­dend of 1.5 cents a share a year ago.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore fell as much as 5 per cent to 67.5 cents be­fore closing down 4.23 per cent or three cents at 68 cents. This came af­ter it logged a $163.3 mil­lion net loss for the sec­ond quar­ter, re­vers­ing a $168.4 mil­lion net profit from a year ago.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing zero rev­enue amid a shut­down of nearly three months in the sec­ond quar­ter as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic dis­rupted global travel and tourism, was “dev­as­tat­ing”.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, it suf­fered a “deficit in cash flow from op­er­at­ing ac­tiv­i­ties of $80.2 mil­lion”, it said.</p>
    <p>DBS Eq­uity Re­search an­a­lyst Ja­son Sum said Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore’s sec­ond-quar­ter losses “did not come as a sur­prise”, but he was caught off guard by the sus­pen­sion of its in­terim div­i­dend.</p>
    <p>But de­spite the “bru­tal hit to its earn­ings, we be­lieve down­side from here on is lim­ited due to its at­trac­tive val­u­a­tion”, he added.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has re­duced op­er­at­ing costs by 20 per cent with a cut in full-time staff, and slashed salaries of ex­ist­ing staff by 20 per cent, Mor­gan Stan­ley Asia eq­uity an­a­lyst Praveen Choud­hary said.</p>
    <p>But without the suc­cess­ful de­vel­op­ment of a coro­n­avirus vac­cine, and fur­ther loos­en­ing of cross-bor­der travel curbs and so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, lo­cal and Malaysian gam­blers will not be enough to help the casino op­er­a­tor break even. Without in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers, its non-gam­ing at­trac­tions will also not be able to break even, he added.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore’s rev­enue for the three months to J une 30 plunged 94 per cent to $41.3 mil­lion from $636.8 mil­lion a year ago, as fall­out from the pan­demic dev­as­tated both its gam­ing and non-gam­ing rev­enues.</p>
    <p>Ow­ing to the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, Re­sorts World Sen­tosa sus­pended all its of­fer­ings, in­clud­ing</p>
    <p>Univer­sal Stu­dios Sin­ga­pore, SEA Aquar­ium, Ad­ven­ture Cove Water­park and Dol­phin Is­land, ho­tels and the casino from April 6 to June 30. The sus­pen­sion sent gam­ing rev­enues plung­ing 99 per cent to just $6.5 mil­lion in the sec­ond quar­ter from $441.1 mil­lion a year ago, while non-gam­ing rev­enues plum­meted 92 per cent to $16.3 mil­lion, from $195 mil­lion a year ago.</p>
    <p>The group’s Ebitda – a mea­sure of profit be­fore in­ter­est, tax and other items – swung into the red with net losses of $84.9 mil­lion in the sec­ond quar­ter from a net profit of $294.4 mil­lion a year ago. Earn­ings per share for the half year ended June 30 came to 0.97 cent, down from 3.1 cents a year ear­lier, while net as­set value was 63.4 cents, against 66.8 cents as at Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, the com­pany’s $4.5 bil­lion mega ex­pan­sion project “RWS 2.0” will be de­layed be­cause of pan­demic-in­duced dis­rup­tion to global sup­ply chains and the lo­cal con­struc­tion in­dus­try. Also, it has to make de­sign changes to in­cor­po­rate health and safety re­quire­ments in a post-Covid-19 en­vi­ron­ment, the com­pany added.</p>
    <p>CGS-CIMB an­a­lyst Cez­zane See has forecast a “tough year for longer-term in­vestors”, say­ing the casino op­er­a­tor’s near-term prospects are un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>But the bro­ker­age re­it­er­ated its “add” call as it be­lieves the com­pany’s strong bal­ance sheet (net cash bal­ance of $3.3 bil­lion as at June 30) will tide it over, and its stock will likely re­cover with the grad­ual re­open­ing of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
