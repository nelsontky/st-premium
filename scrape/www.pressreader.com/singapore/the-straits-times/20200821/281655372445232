    <p>About 6,300 em­ploy­ers have sub­mit­ted no­ti­fi­ca­tions to the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) on their cost-cut­ting mea­sures be­tween March and July, which af­fected about 224,800 lo­cal and for­eign em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal em­ploy­ees made up slightly fewer than half of the to­tal.</p>
    <p>The num­bers are based on the to­tal num­ber of no­ti­fi­ca­tions by em­ploy­ers dur­ing the pe­riod. “As some em­ploy­ers have sub­mit­ted mul­ti­ple no­ti­fi­ca­tions to up­date on their cost-sav­ing mea­sures, the em­ployer and em­ployee counts are not unique,” MOM said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The three most com­mon cost­cut­ting mea­sures were ad­just­ments to monthly salary com­po­nents, no-pay leave and shorter work weeks.</p>
    <p>About half of the af­fected work­ers are from three sec­tors: 52,600 in ac­com­mo­da­tion and food ser­vices, 42,000 in con­struc­tion, and 23,800 in the whole­sale and re­tail trade.</p>
    <p>The tri­par­tite ad­vi­sory on man­ag­ing ex­cess man­power and re­spon­si­ble re­trench­ments was up­dated in March to in­clude re­quire­ments such as no­ti­fy­ing MOM if cost-cut­ting mea­sures af­fect work­ers’ salaries.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers are also re­quired to show that they have im­ple­mented the mea­sures fairly.</p>
