    <p>China scholar David Sham­baugh’s lat­est book is on the United States’ re­la­tion­ship with South-east Asia and how that af­fects its con­test with China. As­so­ci­ate ed­i­tor Ravi Vel­loor takes a look at the book de­tail­ing the ri­valry be­tween the US and China, which the au­thor de­scribes as the defin­ing fea­ture of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>When a China scholar of the em­i­nence of David Sham­baugh writes on the theme of Amer­ica and China in South-east Asia, you need to read the book care­fully. More so, when the au­thor is one who, early in his ca­reer, ac­com­pa­nied Viet­nam-era Sec­re­tary of De­fence Bob McNa­mara to Asia as he pon­dered his pol­icy er­rors there, and as a grad­u­ate stu­dent, met Mr Deng Xiaop­ing when he vis­ited the United States in 1979.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Sham­baugh is no or­di­nary China hand. He was one of the in­flu­en­tial China en­thu­si­asts who thought in­te­grat­ing the main­land into the global sys­tem was a wor­thy en­ter­prise. To­day, he some­times seems to be in a dif­fer­ent place, per­haps even part of the “seis­mic shift in Amer­i­can think­ing about China” that he writes about.</p>
    <p>Where Great Pow­ers Meet, as his lat­est work is called, de­tails the com­pre­hen­sive ri­valry be­tween the US and China that has re­sulted from the shift, a ri­valry he de­scribes as the ma­jor defin­ing fea­ture of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions and one he ex­pects will con­tinue in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>For the first time, a US ad­min­is­tra­tion – un­der Mr Don­ald Trump – has gone on of­fence against China and strat­egy and ac­tions are be­ing taken to counter it.</p>
    <p>While the US and China pos­sess an­ti­thet­i­cal po­lit­i­cal sys­tems and ide­olo­gies, China is just be­gin­ning to ac­tively ex­port its ide­ol­ogy and cre­ate po­lit­i­cal client states, as well as eco­nomic client states, as the Soviet Union once did.</p>
    <p>That said, in Prof Sham­baugh’s view, the US-China com­pe­ti­tion isn’t yet a Cold War-style one. Bei­jing acts more to ad­vance its po­si­tion than to un­der­mine the US.</p>
    <p>How all this plays out in South-east Asia, the “epi­cen­tre” of this con­test, is of global sig­nif­i­cance. Still, in Prof Sham­baugh’s view, South-east Asian states have enough in­de­pen­dent agency, and for that rea­son can “by no means” be con­sid­ered China’s sphere of in­flu­ence. Hence, the re­gion will be the ul­ti­mate “win­ner” as it hedges to keep both pow­ers at bay and max­imises ben­e­fits from en­gag­ing them.</p>
    <p>DEEPER ROOTS, FITFUL AT­TEN­TION</p>
    <p>Nu­anced and sym­pa­thetic, al­ter­nat­ing be­tween paint­ing the wood­scape and ex­am­in­ing in­di­vid­ual trees, the book is a valu­able con­tri­bu­tion – es­pe­cially to US think­ing – as a new ad­min­is­tra­tion pre­pares to en­ter the White House.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, as Prof Sham­baugh points out, not one US em­bassy in South-east Asia – even the big­gest of them in Thai­land – works with a re­gional per­spec­tive while, on the other hand, the US mis­sion to the Asean Sec­re­tar­iat is woe­fully un­der­staffed and a mere wing in the Amer­i­can Em­bassy in Jakarta.</p>
    <p>With that as the back­ground, Prof Sham­baugh finds that while China is work­ing as­sid­u­ously to broaden and deepen its pres­ence in all of South-east Asia, the US re­mains ne­glect­ful and static, its diplo­macy episodic. This is lead­ing to the per­va­sive and pre­dom­i­nant nar­ra­tive that China is the “in­evitable” dom­i­nant power and the US is in in­ex­orable de­cline.</p>
    <p>His strong em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence, though, shows that the US still has deeper roots and pos­sesses far more com­pre­hen­sive power in the re­gion than China. In other words, China’s power is over­es­ti­mated.</p>
    <p>Is it, re­ally?</p>
    <p>Prof Sham­baugh’s book was fin­ished be­fore South-east Asia signed the</p>
    <p>Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) with five di­a­logue part­ners that do</p>
    <p>not in­clude ei­ther the US or In­dia.</p>
    <p>TRADE PACTS AS SIGNPOSTS</p>
    <p>With the prom­ise of an RCEP sec­re­tar­iat and reg­u­lar heads of gov­ern­ment meet­ings, it is an im­por­tant pa­trin to­wards the fu­ture since it in­cludes three of Asia’s four big­gest economies, led by China.</p>
    <p>And it comes af­ter Bei­jing’s ma­ture re­sponses to a se­ries of re­gional and global crises, start­ing with the Asian fi­nan­cial flu of 1997-1999, the 2008 Bei­jing Olympics and the man­i­fes­ta­tion that year of the Global Fi­nan­cial Cri­sis and last year’s out­break of the Covid-19 pan­demic, which it han­dled ad­mirably af­ter seem­ing to fum­ble the ini­tial re­sponse.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the US – its pol­i­tics dys­func­tional, its lead­er­ship delu­sional – has scored sev­eral own goals, such as its with­drawal from the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship. China, as the Lowy In­sti­tute’s Power In­dex for 2020 sug­gested, merely needed to let the US be it­self to see its own in­flu­ence rise in the Asia-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>Prof Sham­baugh gives much credit to Mr Barack Obama for fash­ion­ing strat­egy for the Indo-Pa­cific, as the re­gion is now</p>
    <p>called by the US, and he be­lieves that this is the Amer­i­can pres­i­dent who has shown the most com­mit­ment to the re­gion. This may sur­prise some ob­servers here who be­lieve that Mr Obama’s dis­in­cli­na­tion to en­force the red lines he an­nounced for Syria em­bold­ened the Chi­nese to be more as­sertive in the South China Sea, in­clud­ing break­ing solemn prom­ises made di­rectly to him.</p>
    <p>One sur­prise in the book is that Prof Sham­baugh as­serts there is sparse ex­per­tise on South-east Asia in China, a cu­ri­ous anom­aly. Still, he sees Chi­nese schol­ars as sen­si­tive to the ris­ing Big Power com­pe­ti­tion in the re­gion, even as they are dis­dain­ful of for­mu­la­tions such as “Asean cen­tral­ity”.</p>
    <p>The US, he says, has no deeper, longer and stronger set of mil­i­tary-to-mil­i­tary ties in the re­gion than with the Philip­pines, even more so than its ties with Thai­land, over whose dura­bil­ity he voices se­vere con­cern. Ties with Malaysia op­er­ate un­der the radar for the most part while those with Sin­ga­pore are the most com­pre­hen­sive and ro­bust.</p>
    <p>A QUES­TION OF RE­SOLVE</p>
    <p>That said, China’s great­est diplo­matic tri­umph came with the Novem­ber 2016 visit to Bei­jing by Philip­pine Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte, where he an­nounced his coun­try’s “sep­a­ra­tion” from the US and the be­gin­ning of a “spe­cial re­la­tion­ship” with China. Since then, he notes, Mr Duterte has made four more of­fi­cial vis­its to Bei­jing in the course of just three years, seek­ing in­vest­ment in in­fra­struc­ture and for trade.</p>
    <p>While there is more than one men­tion of Mr Duterte’s flip to­wards China, I wish Prof Sham­baugh had also taken a closer look at the Scar­bor­ough Shoal in­ci­dent of 2012, where the Philip­pines, then led by Pres­i­dent Benigno Aquino III, con­fronted an en­croach­ing flotilla of Chi­nese fish­ing ves­sels pro­tected by mar­itime mili­tia, to see how that ex­pe­ri­ence played a role in Filipino cal­cu­la­tions.</p>
    <p>At the time, the US ne­go­ti­ated a mu­tual with­drawal from the stand-off and while the Philip­pines ac­qui­esced, the Chi­nese re­neged and stayed put. The com­mon per­cep­tion is that the US fum­bled in let­ting that go, es­pe­cially as only a few months ear­lier, then Sec­re­tary of State Hil­lary Clinton had stood on the deck of an Amer­i­can war­ship in Manila Bay and de­scribed the South China Sea as “West Philip­pine Sea”.</p>
    <p>Hadn’t Mrs Clinton ever heard Tammy Wynette sing Stand By Your Man? Filipinos have the right to ask of the US: Where were you when the chips were down?</p>
    <p>Like­wise, af­ter Bei­jing an­nounced its ADIZ (air de­fence iden­ti­fi­ca­tion zone) for the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, in late 2013, the US flew B-52 bombers over the waters from its base in Guam. But Amer­i­can air­lin­ers have since reg­u­larly filed flight plans with China while the na­tion whose car­ri­ers refuse to do so un­der gov­ern­ment or­ders are the Ja­panese ones.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, re­solve mat­ters.</p>
    <p>TAK­ING AMER­ICA FOR GRANTED</p>
    <p>Still, South-east Asians are prone to play foot­sie with China be­cause no one se­ri­ously be­lieves the US is go­ing away, not be­cause they see it as a fad­ing power. It is, af­ter all, the devil you know so well, brought home to your tele­vi­sion screens on Net­flix daily even as you sip Ja­panese sake or feast on Chi­nese take­away.</p>
    <p>As in per­sonal re­la­tion­ships, too many of us take the fa­mil­iar for granted even as we are en­chanted by the un­known and at­tracted to the un­fa­mil­iar.</p>
    <p>Even the Chi­nese are aware of this; while prob­a­bly amused by Mr Duterte’s at­tempts to ser­e­nade Mr Xi Jin­ping, they know the US-Philip­pine re­la­tion­ship is far more rooted to be dis­lodged. For in­stance, the top source of all-crit­i­cal remit­tances to the Philip­pines – money that sus­tains thou­sands of fam­i­lies and ac­counts for a lit­tle over a tenth of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct – is the US, at about US$11 bil­lion (S$14.5 bil­lion) an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte’s petu­lance is re­ally that of a well-fed child kick­ing the toys placed in front of him. Should the milk sup­ply stop, the wail­ing turns into a whim­per.</p>
    <p>One is­sue I have with some schol­ars on Asia is a ten­dency to draw a straight line from Pres­i­dent Xi’s rise to China’s cur­rent as­sertive pos­ture. It has be­come al­most a cliche to say that un­der the cur­rent dis­pen­sa­tion, China has for­got­ten Mr Deng’s ad­vice to hide your strength and bide your time.</p>
    <p>Prof Sham­baugh, who says the US-China ma­noeu­vring in­ten­si­fied sig­nif­i­cantly af­ter Pres­i­dent Obama an­nounced his “pivot to Asia” in 2012, comes per­ilously close to this.</p>
    <p>But what if Mr Xi was merely do­ing what any leader re­spon­si­ble for the des­tiny of 1.4 bil­lion peo­ple would have done in his place, start­ing with guard­ing your fam­ily and home?</p>
    <p>CHI­NESE CON­CERNS</p>
    <p>Ever-in­creas­ing sur­veil­lance on its mil­i­tary fa­cil­i­ties by the US was mak­ing China edgier by the day. In 2001, an Amer­i­can EP-3E sig­nals in­tel­li­gence air­craft col­lided with a Chi­nese war­plane off Hainan is­land, killing a Chi­nese pi­lot and, some say, trig­ger­ing China’s mil­i­tary mod­erni­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>More than a decade later, a se­nior of­fi­cial at the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army think-tank in Bei­jing told me this: “I do not mind if you come to my gate to look in­side. But if you want to stand at the win­dow and read the com­bi­na­tion on my cup­board locks, I have a prob­lem with you.”</p>
    <p>Like­wise, US at­tempts to co-opt In­dia strate­gi­cally clearly raised in­se­cu­ri­ties in Bei­jing, which had al­ways tended to see In­dia as a na­tion that cher­ishes non-align­ment. In early 2005, when I was sta­tioned in New Delhi, then Sec­re­tary of State Con­doleezza Rice came by to tell Prime Min­is­ter Man­mo­han Singh that the US goal “is to help In­dia be­come a ma­jor power in the 21st cen­tury” and move the re­la­tion­ship to “sub­stan­tially new ar­eas”.</p>
    <p>Power is earned, or seized, not gifted. Un­sur­pris­ingly, Bei­jing’s in­ter­pre­ta­tion was that the US was set­ting up In­dia, the only Asian power with the size and po­ten­tial to have some sort of par­ity with it, as a cat’s paw to check it.</p>
    <p>De­spite all at­tempts by wise old Dr Singh to in­sist that this was a stand­alone re­la­tion­ship not aimed at a third party, Bei­jing wasn’t con­vinced. By 2007, China had shifted from its agreed po­si­tion on the frame­work of a Sino-In­dian bor­der agree­ment and to­day, the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Asia’s two tec­tonic plates is in tat­ters. Worse, the two have in­dulged in the most bar­baric of clashes along the Hi­malayan slopes.</p>
    <p>NIGHT­MARE SCE­NARIO</p>
    <p>I am with Prof Sham­baugh when he says China needs to mod­er­ate its be­hav­iour. But that is easy to say and it may even be too late to change per­cep­tions.</p>
    <p>As the dis­tin­guished Sin­ga­porean diplo­mat and strate­gic thinker Bi­la­hari Kausikan re­cently wrote, Mr Xi, with his as­sertive­ness, has “made a strate­gic mis­take that can­not be re­versed”.</p>
    <p>In other words, for many Asians the night­mare sce­nario has be­come real – that de­spite China’s long record of wish­ing to live in peace with its neigh­bours, in­clud­ing an em­peror who or­dered his navy de­stroyed be­cause he saw no en­e­mies to the south, and the ac­com­moda­tive deals with most of its neigh­bours to set­tle its land bor­ders and the con­stant talk of win-win, the world must ready for a China that has bro­ken with its past.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s im­per­a­tive is to keep South-east Asia open and en­gaged with­out hav­ing to shed blood; China’s to ma­noeu­vre its way up­wards with­out push­ing Wash­ing­ton to that tip­ping point.</p>
    <p>With its long view, Bei­jing can­not be un­aware that in 1900, fully two-thirds of the US Army was de­ployed in the Philip­pines to sup­press the so-called in­sur­rec­tion of what was then an Amer­i­can colony.</p>
    <p>It would be wise to not un­der­es­ti­mate China’s power. To dis­miss Amer­i­can re­solve as fan­ci­ful could be even more dan­ger­ous.</p>
