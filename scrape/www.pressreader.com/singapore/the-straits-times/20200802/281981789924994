    <p>PARIS • Swathes of Western Europe wilted un­der in­tense heat on Fri­day, with so­cially dis­tanced crowds seek­ing re­lief in foun­tains and pools as the au­thor­i­ties warned of health and wild­fire risks.</p>
    <p>From Britain to Italy, tem­per­a­tures of around 40 deg C made face masks al­most un­bear­able for many, as more cities be­gin re­quir­ing peo­ple to wear them out­doors to pre­vent surges in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>“Even in this sti­fling heat, it’s bet­ter to put up with 38 de­grees than catch the coron­avirus,” said mu­nic­i­pal worker Daniela Ian­nelli in Rome.</p>
    <p>Four­teen Ital­ian cities were placed on high alert, while France is­sued warn­ings for about one-third of the country’s 101 de­part­ments.</p>
    <p>Paris of­fi­cials im­posed driv­ing re­stric­tions to limit ozone pol­lu­tion as tens of thou­sands of va­ca­tion­ers prepared to flee to cooler climes, said the traf­fic sur­veil­lance agency.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, a dra­matic wild­fire fanned by high winds on France’s south-western At­lantic coast was brought un­der con­trol after it de­stroyed nearly a dozen homes and forced about 100 peo­ple to evac­u­ate.</p>
    <p>The blaze broke out late Thurs­day in the Chib­erta for­est park in An­glet, whose beaches just north of Biar­ritz draw surfers from around the world.</p>
    <p>It was the lat­est of sev­eral fires in south­ern and cen­tral France in the past week, kick­ing off the an­nual fire season which of­fi­cials warn could be wors­ened by drought and dry heat.</p>
    <p>“The heat­wave re­quires the state to be vig­i­lant, and ev­ery­one to be cau­tious,” French Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex said while vis­it­ing fire­fight­ers in Bourg-en-Bresse, south­east­ern France.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials also urged fam­i­lies and neigh­bours to check on the el­derly, and re­tire­ment homes were on high alert since air-con­di­tion­ers were dis­cour­aged over fears that they could fos­ter coron­avirus con­ta­gion.</p>
    <p>An in­crease in Covid-19 cases prompted French of­fi­cials to tighten face mask re­quire­ments in sev­eral cities, with many mak­ing them manda­tory out­doors as well as in en­closed pub­lic spa­ces.</p>
    <p>In the Nether­lands, beach­go­ers were told to avoid the coastal re­sort of Zand­voort near Am­s­ter­dam, with the pub­lic safety au­thor­i­ties say­ing it was too crowded to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>“There are much qui­eter beaches on our coast and on other wa­ters – I ad­vise you to look for them,” the re­gional safety au­thor­ity chair­man</p>
    <p>Mar­i­anne Schu­ur­mans was quoted as say­ing by Dutch me­dia.</p>
    <p>Long queues of cy­clists formed to take the ferry to Schier­mon­nikoog, one of the West Frisian is­lands near the Ger­man bor­der, as tem­per­a­tures in the south­ern Nether­lands jumped to 35 deg C.</p>
    <p>Britain’s na­tional weather ser­vice said Fri­day was “the hottest day of the year by some way”, with the mer­cury climb­ing to 37.8 deg C at Lon­don’s Heathrow Air­port. Many in the cap­i­tal packed onto trains head­ing for Brighton on the south­ern coast.</p>
    <p>The Spanish weather ser­vice said most of the country was scorch­ing un­der an air mass mov­ing north from Africa. Madrid re­ported 38 deg C on Fri­day while sev­eral cities in the in­te­rior saw 40 deg or more.</p>
    <p>In Ger­many, which also recorded its hottest day this year with tem­per­a­tures ex­ceed­ing 35 deg C in parts of the south, pub­lic pools im­posed lim­its on swim­mer num­bers in a bid to re­duce in­fec­tion risk.</p>
    <p>Western Europe was ex­pected to see re­lief from the high tem­per­a­tures from yes­ter­day, fore­casts showed.</p>
