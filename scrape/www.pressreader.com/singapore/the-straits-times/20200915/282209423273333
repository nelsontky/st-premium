    <p>Sin­ga­pore stocks ended yes­ter­day on a broadly weaker note, amid waves of late af­ter­noon sell­ing.</p>
    <p>The bench­mark Straits Times Index (STI) closed at 2,482.55, down 7.54 points, or 0.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Among the big­gest losers of the day was Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, which sank 1.4 per cent to close at $3.51.</p>
    <p>This comes after the air­line said last week that about 2,400 staff mem­bers will be re­trenched, a clear sign it is pre­par­ing to weather a pro­tracted slump in in­ter­na­tional long-haul air travel.</p>
    <p>Among other STI com­po­nents that ended weaker yes­ter­day were As­cen­das Reit, down 1.22 per cent to $3.23, and Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional, which sank 1.19 per cent to $4.15.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the spec­trum, the best per­form­ers of the day were Cap­i­taLand Com­mer­cial Trust (CCT) and Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust (CMT), which are due to seek unit holder ap­proval for their merger plans later this month.</p>
    <p>The man­agers of the two Reits (real estate in­vest­ment trusts) have said the merger will en­able them to bet­ter pur­sue growth ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>CCT rose 2.38 per cent to close at $1.72; CMT climbed 2.03 per cent to close at $2.01.</p>
    <p>Else­where, Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries edged 0.85 per cent higher to close at $1.19. The stock has en­joyed a sig­nif­i­cant re-rat­ing since re­cap­i­tal­is­ing and de-merg­ing its sub­sidiary, Sem­b­corp Ma­rine.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, Sem­bMarine – which has just com­pleted a five-forone rights is­sue of new shares priced at 20 cents – con­tin­ued sink­ing. It ended yes­ter­day 0.61 per cent down at 16.2 cents, but traded as low as 15.7 cents dur­ing the day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, mar­kets across the re­gion were gen­er­ally firmer, amid grow­ing an­tic­i­pa­tion among an­a­lysts that cor­rec­tion in the S&P 500, which has fallen nearly 7 per cent since Sept 2, could be end­ing.</p>
    <p>Bench­mark in­dexes for Tokyo, Shang­hai, Seoul, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta ended the day in pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.65 per cent on ex­pec­ta­tions that the coun­try’s next gov­ern­ment will not make ma­jor pol­icy shifts.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Kospi climbed 1.3 per cent, the high­est close since Aug 13. The index was helped by sharp gains in Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics and strong for­eign buy­ing, while eas­ing of so­cial dis­tanc­ing curbs in Seoul also aided sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index ended up 0.56 per cent, while China’s bench­mark Shang­hai Com­pos­ite Index added 0.57 per cent.</p>
