    <p>Fi­nance man­ager Kath­leen David, 29, and hubby Teh Ching Kai, 32, re­turned to Jewel Changi Air­port on Sun­day night af­ter months of stay­ing away, join­ing a steady flow of vis­i­tors back to en­joy the world’s tallest in­door wa­ter­fall and get­ting their fix of food and fun.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a few months since we vis­ited Jewel, but the Rain Vor­tex is mag­nif­i­cent as ever and we felt safe. The mall was clean and not over­crowded,” she de­clared ex­cit­edly.</p>
    <p>They have good rea­son to feel safe there amid the coron­avirus pan­demic. The lifestyle and re­tail com­plex has rolled out strict safety mea­sures that in­clude SafeEn­try at en­trances and ex­its; clean­ing and san­i­ta­tion of high-touch ar­eas such as lift but­tons, di­rec­to­ries and es­ca­la­tor handrails; and clear sig­nage and floor mark­ers re­mind­ing vis­i­tors to keep a safe dis­tance.</p>
    <p>The crowd is a far cry from what Jewel saw dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from early April to June, when al­most ev­ery­thing at the at­trac­tion screeched to a halt.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the eight-week shut­down, key at­trac­tions at Jewel pre­vi­ously teem­ing with fam­i­lies emp­tied and less than a sixth of its shops and food and bev­er­age (F&B) out­lets re­mained open.</p>
    <p>Be­hind the scenes, how­ever, Jewel staff leapt into ac­tion.</p>
    <p>“We had always planned for the next big pan­demic,” said Mr Muham­mad Fithri Ab­dul Jaf­far, 33, Jewel’s se­nior man­ager of re­tail ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Staff were trained to op­er­ate in a pan­demic be­fore the first case of Covid-19 hit Sin­ga­pore, based on Changi Air­port’s past ex­pe­ri­ences with in­fec­tious dis­eases like the H1N1 virus and se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Sars).</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing cri­sis and busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity plans be­fore­hand, such as tem­per­a­ture screen­ing pro­ce­dures and an iso­la­tion plan for vis­i­tors who feel un­well, helped us to tran­si­tion eas­ier when the safe man­age­ment mea­sures were im­ple­mented,” he said.</p>
    <p>Well be­fore the Gov­ern­ment-en­forced safety re­quire­ments for busi­nesses in May, Jewel im­ple­mented tem­per­a­ture screen­ing and en­cour­aged ten­ants to maintain a dis­tance be­tween din­ers at F&B out­lets. Safety no walk in the park</p>
    <p>Keep­ing Changi Air­port’s crown jewel safe and clean has by no means been easy.</p>
    <p>Its lean team of about 60 em­ploy­ees, which out­sources the clean­ing of the premises, has had to bal­ance strict hy­giene and clean­ing pro­to­cols with cus­tomer ex­pe­ri­ence and the ex­pec­ta­tions of ten­ants from more than 280 eater­ies and shops.</p>
    <p>“For ten­ants with a big fol­low­ing like Poke­mon, Shake Shack and A&W, we worked with them to put floor mark­ers and of­fered them spa­ces, like the com­mon cor­ri­dor, so that they can ac­com­mo­date cus­tomers while mak­ing sure they keep a safe dis­tance,” said Mr Fithri.</p>
    <p>His team speaks to ten­ants regularly to un­der­stand their chal­lenges and help them im­ple­ment safe man­age­ment mea­sures prop­erly.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Canopy Park — an in­door park the size of 11 Olympic-size swim­ming pools on Jewel’s top floor — re­opened to the pub­lic on July 3, staff were re­de­ployed from other tasks to man­age crowds and en­force safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>High-touch sur­faces and play ar­eas like the Mir­ror Maze and Sky Nets were coated with a self-dis­in­fect­ing agent called sdst, which can last for six months. The an­timi­cro­bial coat­ing, made in the United States and ap­proved by the US En­vi­ron­men­tal Pro­tec­tion Agency, kills bac­te­ria, viruses and fungi upon con­tact and re­mains in place even with re­peated scrub­bing and clean­ing.</p>
    <p>“Even the turf in play ar­eas is coated with this an­timi­cro­bial agent be­cause there may be kids touch­ing it. We do fre­quent wipe downs of high-touch ar­eas on top of this coat­ing,” said Mr Alex Foo, 31, a man­ager in Jewel’s Re­tail Ex­pe­ri­ence team.</p>
    <p>Mr Ju­lian Hu, 30, a se­nior ex­ec­u­tive in Jewel’s Guest Ex­pe­ri­ence team, stressed that the park now lim­its vis­i­tors to 25 per cent of its nor­mal ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Quick ac­tion to en­hance safety and hy­giene lev­els has paid off. At­trac­tions at Jewel re­ceived an SG Clean cer­ti­fi­ca­tion from the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board, and the mall saw fam­i­lies re­turn­ing dur­ing the mid-term school break in July.</p>
    <p>Mr Teh, who vis­ited Jewel last Sun­day, said: “There was a gen­eral bustling at­mos­phere within the mall. We saw fam­i­lies with young chil­dren and cou­ples. Peo­ple didn’t need to crowd around store­fronts and we felt at ease.”</p>
