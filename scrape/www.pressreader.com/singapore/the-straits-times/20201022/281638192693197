    <p>The United States Dairy Ex­port Coun­cil vir­tu­ally launched its new cen­tre at Sin­ga­pore’s Robert­son Quay yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It will serve as the re­gional hub for US dairy ex­ports, fur­ther so­lid­i­fy­ing Sin­ga­pore as the US dairy in­dus­try’s base in the area.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre is funded by US dairy farm­ers and pro­ces­sors and will be an in­no­va­tion and ed­u­ca­tion hub, with a demon­stra­tion kitchen, a sen­sory eval­u­a­tion lab, and meet­ing and train­ing rooms.</p>
    <p>Its aim is to be­come a plat­form for dis­cov­er­ing South-east Asian uses for US dairy prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Ex­per­i­men­tal com­bi­na­tions of US dairy in­gre­di­ents and lo­cal prod­ucts such as gula me­laka, or palm sugar, have been tri­alled.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil has been work­ing on a pro­to­type called “high pro­tein gula me­laka lassi-tte”, which is a pro­tein-rich drink made by com­bin­ing US-pro­duced whey pro­tein with yogurt, low fat milk and gula me­laka.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the coun­cil said that the cen­tre was “en­vi­sioned as a gate­way for col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the US dairy com­mu­nity and South-east Asia’s food and bev­er­age stake­hold­ers, the culi­nary sec­tor, health pro­fes­sion­als and other part­ners”.</p>
    <p>South-east Asia is on pace to be­come the top com­bined mar­ket for US dairy ex­ports by vol­ume this year, over­tak­ing Mex­ico, with a to­tal ex­port value of $1.27 bil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>US dairy ex­ports to the re­gion grew by US$250 million (S$338.9 million) from 2017 to last year.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil’s pres­i­dent and chief ex­ec­u­tive Tom Vil­sack said: “(The cen­tre) rep­re­sents a longterm com­mit­ment by the US dairy in­dus­try to the re­gion and ex­ports, and recog­ni­tion of the im­por­tance of South-east Asia as an in­no­va­tion hub.”</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State for Trade and In­dus­try Low Yen Ling was the guest of hon­our at the vir­tual open­ing of the cen­tre.</p>
    <p>She em­pha­sised the strength of con­tin­ued trade re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore aims to con­tinue be­ing a crit­i­cal node for Amer­i­can busi­nesses and or­gan­i­sa­tions seek­ing to tap growth op­por­tu­ni­ties in the re­gion,” she said.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines is the big­gest re­gional im­porter of US dairy prod­ucts, fol­lowed by In­done­sia and Viet­nam. Last year, Sin­ga­pore im­ported about 37,000 tonnes of US dairy prod­ucts and ac­counted for 9 per cent of all re­gional im­ports of US dairy prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil is a non-profit, in­de­pen­dent mem­ber­ship body that rep­re­sents the global trade in­ter­ests of US dairy producers, pro­ces­sors and co­op­er­a­tives, in­gre­di­ent sup­pli­ers and ex­port traders.</p>
