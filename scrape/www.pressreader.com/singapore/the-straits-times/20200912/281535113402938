    <p>Work­ers in pro­tec­tive gear bury­ing a Covid-19 vic­tim at a site ear­marked for pandemic cases in Jakarta yes­ter­day. In­done­sia moved to en­force mask wear­ing across the coun­try as in­fec­tions rose by 3,737 to 210,940 yes­ter­day, and 88 more deaths were recorded, bring­ing the to­tal toll to 8,544.</p>
    <p>In­dia con­tin­ued to set daily record rises in coronaviru­s cases as of­fi­cial mor­tal­ity rates stayed sup­pressed.</p>
    <p>The coun­try saw an in­crease of 96,551 new cases in the last 24 hours, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Health and Fam­ily Wel­fare yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>With new daily caseloads far sur­pass­ing other coun­tries’, these fig­ures come even as a sero-preva­lence sur­vey by the In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search found that In­dia had an es­ti­mated 6.4 mil­lion in­fec­tions in May, when of­fi­cial fig­ures for the mid­dle of that month put the num­ber of pos­i­tive cases at 85,940. This means that po­ten­tially mil­lions went un­de­tected.</p>
    <p>At the time, test­ing was av­er­ag­ing 100,000 tests a day. That has now been ramped up to one mil­lion tests a day on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>For the sero sur­vey, which tracks an­ti­bod­ies to as­sess ex­po­sure to the virus, 28,000 peo­ple were tested.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said In­dia’s num­bers would con­tinue go­ing up, likely sur­pass­ing the US, which cur­rently has the high­est num­ber of cases. In­dia has more than 4.5 mil­lion cases. The US has 6.59 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>“It will keep go­ing up. Virus trans­mis­sion is tak­ing place more or less freely. There is no great mys­tery about it... We have a large pop­u­la­tion,” said lead­ing In­dian epi­demi­ol­o­gist Jayaprakas­h Muliyil.</p>
    <p>“For­tu­nately, the fu­ture is not bleak... Peo­ple who get the dis­ease and get out of it seem to have good im­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>In­dia im­ple­mented a com­plete lock­down on March 25 which brought all eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity to a halt. It has since grad­u­ally loos­ened restric­tions as wor­ries have grown about the health of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Still, the gov­ern­ment has taken In­dia’s low mor­tal­ity rate and high re</p>
    <p>cov­ery rate (77.65 per cent) as a good sign and a re­sult of ef­forts to im­prove med­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture and has­ten de­tec­tion of cases.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s mor­tal­ity rate at 1.7 per cent, cal­cu­lated by Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity of Medicine, is among the world’s low­est.</p>
    <p>The death rate in Mex­ico, the high­est world­wide, is 10.7 per cent. The US, which has the world’s high­est caseload, has a death rate of 3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts be­lieve In­dia’s low mor­tal­ity rate could be due to a com­bi­na­tion of fac­tors, in­clud­ing a younger de­mo­graphic, with 65 per cent be­low the age of 35, as well as the el­derly stay­ing at home in­stead of at old-age homes like in the West.</p>
    <p>But another key fac­tor is seen to be po­ten­tial un­der-re­port­ing of cases. The death toll as at yes­ter­day was 76,271.</p>
    <p>Due to co-mor­bidi­ties – other pre-ex­ist­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions – cases are also re­port­edly be­ing writ­ten off as non-Covid-19. Sev­eral states such as As­sam have faced crit­i­cism of un­der-re­port­ing cases.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 can­not be elim­i­nated as a cause of death (in cases) even if there are co-mor­bidi­ties,” said Dr Ra­jib Das­gupta, chair­man of the Cen­tre of So­cial Medicine and Com­mu­nity Health at Jawa­har­lal Nehru Univer­sity. He noted that many states are re­view­ing and ver­i­fy­ing Covid-19 deaths.</p>
    <p>With more than 940,000 ac­tive</p>
    <p>cases and spik­ing in­fec­tions, In­dia’s health in­fra­struc­ture will now face its big­gest test.</p>
    <p>As num­bers rise, Ker­ala Health Min­is­ter K. K. Shailaja, ac­cord­ing to a gov­ern­ment press re­lease, has warned that the Covid-19 death toll in the state may go up fur­ther, with the lift­ing of restric­tions.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral health min­istry on Thurs­day asked states not to put restric­tions on the cross-bor­der move­ment of oxy­gen.</p>
    <p>Said Dr Muliyil: “Now, some states are show­ing signs of strain on health ser­vices. I be­lieve mor­tal­ity is­sues will come into much more fo­cus.”</p>
    <p>It will keep go­ing up. Virus trans­mis­sion is tak­ing place more or less freely. There is no great mys­tery about it... We have a large pop­u­la­tion. For­tu­nately, the fu­ture is not bleak... Peo­ple who get the dis­ease and get out of it seem to have good im­mu­nity.</p>
