    <p>Af­ter 14 years with The Song of In­dia, chef Man­ju­nath Mu­ral (above) has left the one-Miche­lin-starred fine­din­ing es­tab­lish­ment in Scotts Road to open a more ca­sual out­fit.</p>
    <p>Called Adda – which the 47-year-old chef says is an In­dian slang for “get­ting to­gether and be­ing in the neigh­bour­hood” – the new 70-seat res­tau­rant will be lo­cated in Beach Road. The 2,000 sq ft space – slated to open in Novem­ber – will com­mence ren­o­va­tions soon.</p>
    <p>Ex­pect neoIn­dian cui­sine, he says, where he presents a new per­spec­tive on tra­di­tional dishes. But­ter chicken, a peren­nial favourite, will be served as a but­ter chicken pot pie. Or go for the pulled lamb Desi taco, which is filled with stir-fried lamb and topped with masala sour cream.</p>
    <p>The new ven­ture is in part­ner­ship with the Ge­nie Col­lec­tive Group, a food and bev­er­age com­pany which runs Beirut Grill in Bus­so­rah Street; Ke­babs Fak­tory in Shen­ton Way and one-north; and night­club Magic Car­pet in Beach Road.</p>
    <p>Chef Mu­ral has been in­stru­men­tal in The Song of In­dia gain­ing a Miche­lin star in the 2016 Miche­lin Guide. It has re­tained the star since then. On his time at the res­tau­rant, which he left last month, he says: “Look­ing back, I had an amaz­ing time, to help The Song of In­dia cre­ate a brand that pro­moted In­dian cui­sine in South-east Asia and the world.”</p>
    <p>Over the years, he has con­sulted with In­dian restau­rants over­seas and done guest chef stints at food fes­ti­vals. He says all this ex­pe­ri­ence with dif­fer­ent restau­ra­teurs and din­ers from other coun­tries and cul­tures has helped shape the con­cept of Adda.</p>
    <p>He adds: “My pas­sion has al­ways been to share the her­itage of re­gional In­dian cui­sine and make it ac­ces­si­ble.</p>
    <p>“Once bor­ders re-open, my dream is to con­sult or open more restau­rants in South-east Asia and be­yond. I was in the mid­dle of a few dis­cus­sions be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic hit, so I know the in­ter­est in In­dian cui­sine is there over­seas.”</p>
