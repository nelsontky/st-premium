    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong rolled up his sleeve for the Covid-19 vac­cine in­jec­tion yes­ter­day, as the na­tion­wide vac­ci­na­tion ef­fort to com­bat the coro­n­avirus swung into high gear.</p>
    <p>A left-han­der, PM Lee was ad­min­is­tered the shot in his right arm by nurse Fa­timah Mohd Shah, and ex­pe­ri­enced no side ef­fects de­spite a 30-minute pre­cau­tion­ary wait.</p>
    <p>“It is pain­less, it is ef­fec­tive and it is im­por­tant,” he told re­porters at Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal (SGH), where he re­ceived his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine, the only one to be ap­proved here so far.</p>
    <p>“I hope that Sin­ga­pore­ans will take it up as we roll it out.”</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry’s di­rec­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak, as well as 88 health­care staff, also re­ceived their shots yes­ter­day, as the vac­ci­na­tion drive for health­care work­ers and front-line staff gets un­der way.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine is free and will be rolled out pro­gres­sively, with</p>
    <p>most peo­ple here able to get vac­ci­nated by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>The el­derly, those at greater risk of se­vere dis­ease and those in jobs or set­tings with a high risk of su­per-spread­ing events will be able to re­ceive the Covid-19 jabs from next month.</p>
    <p>Wide­spread vac­ci­na­tions will be crit­i­cal in end­ing the pan­demic and al­low­ing life to be­come more nor­mal around the world.</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 num­bers in Sin­ga­pore re­main low, they have been inch­ing up as mea­sures were re­laxed since phase three of re­open­ing started on Dec 28.</p>
    <p>Im­ported cases, in par­tic­u­lar, have been on the rise, as more peo­ple are al­lowed into the coun­try.</p>
    <p>There were eight new cases in the com­mu­nity in the past week, and 10 the week be­fore.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, there were 23 new coro­n­avirus cases, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,836.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic con­tin­ues to rage around the world, coun­tries are ur­gently rolling out Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions, with Bri­tain the first to start a mass vac­ci­na­tion drive with the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine on Dec 8.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore had launched a small-scale vac­ci­na­tion ex­er­cise on 40 staff at the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases on Dec 30 to test the roll­out process.</p>
    <p>PM Lee will be tak­ing his sec­ond dose of the vac­cine in three weeks.</p>
    <p>“We have got am­ple vac­cines com­ing in, we or­dered them early. We have enough for ev­ery­body in Sin­ga­pore, all the res­i­dents, all the ci­ti­zens and even the non-ci­ti­zens who are stay­ing here,” he said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He added: “It will make us safer, and it will make you and your loved ones safer too. So, please take it when you get it.”</p>
    <p>Se­nior staff nurse Fa­timah, 41, a vet­eran of al­most 20 years at SGH, learnt the night be­fore that she was go­ing to be the one ad­min­is­ter­ing PM Lee’s in­jec­tion.</p>
    <p>She was “a bit ner­vous”, but said she felt hon­oured, her smile shin­ing through her mask in the we­fie that PM Lee took with her later.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, who posted pho­tos of his ex­pe­ri­ence on Face­book, wrote: “In the gen­tle and ca­pa­ble hands of Se­nior Staff Nurse Fa­timah. I barely felt the nee­dle!”</p>
    <p>Ms Chang Yan Jun, 25, a ra­dio­g­ra­pher in SGH’s emer­gency depart­ment, also got vac­ci­nated yes­ter­day. “At first, I was a bit ner­vous, but then, af­ter tak­ing the vac­cine, I feel like ac­tu­ally, it is (okay). I don’t have any (dis­com­fort),” she said.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine was also rolled out to the staff at other public health­care in­sti­tu­tions such as Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal and Sengkang Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Staff at pri­vate health­care group Park­way Pan­tai and Mount Alver­nia and Far­rer Park hos­pi­tals will get their shots start­ing to­day.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has said that more vac­cines are set to ar­rive soon, in­clud­ing those by Amer­i­can biotech­nol­ogy firm Moderna and China’s Si­no­vac.</p>
    <p>AM­PLE SUP­PLY</p>
    <p>We have got am­ple vac­cines com­ing in, we or­dered them early. We have enough for ev­ery­body in Sin­ga­pore, all the res­i­dents, all the ci­ti­zens and even the non-ci­ti­zens who are stay­ing here. "</p>
    <p>PRIME MIN­IS­TER LEE HSIEN LOONG</p>
    <p>NO DIS­COM­FORT AF­TER­WARDS</p>
    <p>At first, I was a bit ner­vous, but then, af­ter tak­ing the vac­cine, I feel like ac­tu­ally, it is (okay). I don’t have ’’ any (dis­com­fort).</p>
