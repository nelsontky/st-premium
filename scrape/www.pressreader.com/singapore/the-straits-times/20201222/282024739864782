    <p>It’s about as near as sci­ence gets to a mir­a­cle: A coro­n­avirus vac­cine has ar­rived – and the main rea­son is that mRNA vac­cines, a pre­vi­ously untested tech­nol­ogy, ap­pear to work bet­ter than al­most any­one had hoped.</p>
    <p>As re­cently as this sum­mer, many an­a­lysts were push­ing their pre­dic­tions for a vac­cine into the au­tumn of 2021, in line with the time­line of tra­di­tional treat­ments. If th­ese new vac­cines per­form as well in the wild as they have in clin­i­cal tri­als, the world will re­mem­ber it as a vic­tory per­haps greater than Salk and Sabin against po­lio. If this new type of vac­cine also goes on to work against other viruses, it will mark an epochal ad­vance in vac­ci­nol­ogy, closer to the dis­cov­er­ies of Louis Pas­teur and Edward Jen­ner.</p>
    <p>But a strange thing has hap­pened in our cel­e­bra­tion of this sci­en­tific tri­umph. While we re­mem­ber those his­toric ad­vances as the work of in­di­vid­ual sci­en­tists or lab­o­ra­to­ries, the vac­cines against Covid-19 are be­ing writ­ten in­stead as a vic­tory for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The rule in press cov­er­age seems to be that the big­gest brand in­volved gets top credit. And so, ev­ery day now there are sto­ries about the Pfizer vac­cine (a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween Pfizer and the Ger­man biotech com­pany BioNTech); the Moderna vac­cine (a part­ner­ship be­tween the US Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health and Moderna); and the As­traZeneca vac­cine (a front-run­ning non-mRNA can­di­date, in fact cre­ated by sci­en­tists at the Univer­sity of Ox­ford and de­vel­oped and distribute­d by As­traZeneca).</p>
    <p>It’s an in­cred­i­ble pub­lic re­la­tions coup for an in­dus­try des­per­ate to res­cue its im­age. Just last month, Pur­due Pharma pleaded guilty and agreed to penal­ties of more than US$8 bil­lion (S$10.7 bil­lion) af­ter be­ing pros­e­cuted for its role in Amer­ica’s hor­rific opi­oid cri­sis. Pfizer set an ear­lier record for a drug in­dus­try fraud set­tle­ment in 2009 at US$2.3 bil­lion, in a case over its fraud­u­lent mar­ket­ing of a painkiller, an an­tipsy­chotic and other drugs for con­di­tions for which it hadn’t re­ceived ap­proval.</p>
    <p>The turpi­tude of the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try is so com­mon­place that it has be­come part of the cul­tural wallpaper. The screen­writ­ers of the 1993 movie The Fugi­tive knew they could find a per­fectly plau­si­ble vil­lain to men­ace Har­ri­son Ford in a face­less drug com­pany out to cover up its malfea­sance. (The film was a hit.)</p>
    <p>In John le Carre’s 2001 novel</p>
    <p>The Con­stant Gar­dener, a Bri­tish diplo­mat un­cov­er­ing a pharma gi­ant test­ing dan­ger­ous drugs on poor Africans is sim­i­larly easy to swal­low: Its plot­line echoes a real case in­volv­ing Pfizer in Nige­ria. (The com­pany has de­nied any wrong­do­ing and set­tled out of court the suit brought by the fam­i­lies of chil­dren who died dur­ing the test­ing.)</p>
    <p>And yet, since the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try stepped in with the vac­cines, gen­er­a­tions worth of ill will ap­pear to be melt­ing away. Last year, Gallup polling had the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try ranked the most dis­liked in Amer­ica, be­low both big oil and big gov­ern­ment. By this Septem­ber – even be­fore the vac­cines ar­rived – the in­dus­try’s ap­proval rat­ing was al­ready im­prov­ing.</p>
    <p>This isn’t lost on the in­dus­try it­self. A fi­nan­cial an­a­lyst re­cently told this pa­per that Pfizer’s in­volve­ment in the coro­n­avirus pan­demic was about “as much pub­lic re­la­tions as it is a fi­nan­cial re­turn”. In April, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Eli Lilly, the com­pany that put out an an­ti­body ther­apy for Covid-19, told in­vestors that the pan­demic of­fered “a once-in-a-gen­er­a­tion op­por­tu­nity to re­set the rep­u­ta­tion of the in­dus­try”.</p>
    <p>We’ve all been hop­ing for a vac­cine for so long, the mo­ment the medicine is fi­nally be­ing de­liv­ered, it seems al­most per­verse to ques­tion the name on the vial. But the in­dus­try isn’t our saviour. Each of th­ese vac­cine can­di­dates is a com­plex sci­en­tific project with many col­lab­o­ra­tors – and a sub­stan­tial level of state sup­port. Giv­ing the in­dus­try not just plau­dits but also con­trol over the vac­cines them­selves would be a mis­take.</p>
    <p>Even amid this pub­lic re­la­tions coup, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal cor­po­ra­tions can’t help but re­vert to type. They will profit hand­somely from th­ese vac­cines, even when they claim to be act­ing self­lessly. And they largely are mo­nop­o­lis­ing ac­cess, which means that mil­lions in the global south may not get the life-sav­ing vac­cines for months.</p>
    <p>The mRNA vac­cines in which peo­ple are now stak­ing so much hope wouldn’t ex­ist with­out pub­lic sup­port through ev­ery step of their de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Moderna is not a pharma gi­ant. In fact, it is, in a way, a home-grown suc­cess story. The com­pany, founded in 2010 af­ter a group of Amer­i­can univer­sity pro­fes­sors ac­quired sup­port from a ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist, has been work­ing on this tech­nol­ogy for years. But Moderna’s orig­i­nal work rests on ear­lier dis­cov­er­ies by sci­en­tists at the Univer­sity of Penn­syl­va­nia who have re­ceived fund­ing for their re­search from the Na­tional In­sti­tutes of Health (NIH).</p>
    <p>Once the race for a vac­cine be­gan, gov­ern­ments su­per­charged their ef­forts. Moderna has re­ceived about US$2.5 bil­lion in fed­eral re­search and sup­ply fund­ing over the past year from the gov­ern­ment’s Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed pro­gramme, as well as shared tech­nol­ogy the NIH had de­vel­oped for pre­vi­ous coro­n­avirus vac­cines. The NIH also pro­vided ex­ten­sive lo­gis­ti­cal sup­port, over­see­ing clin­i­cal tri­als for tens of thou­sands of pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Pfizer, mean­while, likes to say that it es­chews fed­eral money to main­tain in­de­pen­dence. But it is co-pro­duc­ing and dis­tribut­ing a vac­cine from BioNTech, a com­pany that re­ceived more than US$440 mil­lion in fund­ing from the Ger­man fed­eral gov­ern­ment. The vac­cine is based on BioNTech’s tech­nol­ogy, with Pfizer step­ping in to speed up de­vel­op­ment and man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Pfizer had never pro­duced an mRNA vac­cine, but it retro­fit­ted sev­eral fac­to­ries to do so. In ef­fect, it traded its im­mense cap­i­tal and lo­gis­tics net­work for brand­ing rights. More­over, the US gov­ern­ment claims that by plac­ing a nearly US$2 bil­lion order be­fore the vac­cine’s fi­nal clin­i­cal tri­als started, it re­moved sig­nif­i­cant fi­nan­cial risks for Pfizer.</p>
    <p>The de­vel­op­ment of th­ese vac­cines in­volves a patch­work of aca­demic re­search, biotech firms, pub­lic in­sti­tu­tions, pub­lic money and Big Pharma. This has al­ways been the case, but in the past, gov­ern­ments and aca­demic sci­en­tists were able to have far more con­trol over their con­tri­bu­tions. Both Salk and Sabin made their po­lio vac­cine dis­cov­er­ies pa­tent-free. At the time, Pfizer was among the main man­u­fac­tur­ers and dis­trib­u­tors of the Sabin vac­cine – mak­ing a tidy profit for pro­vid­ing this ser­vice, but rightly ac­knowl­edged as a small part of a larger whole.</p>
    <p>What do th­ese kinds of part­ner­ship get us to­day? The US gov­ern­ment ne­go­ti­ated bulk pric­ing for both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cines, US$15.25 to US$19.50 per dose over sev­eral dif­fer­ent con­tracts. This is sig­nif­i­cantly less than the US$25 to US$37 Moderna says it will charge gov­ern­ments in the rest of the world, but an­a­lysts sug­gest that even US$19.50 could yield Pfizer a 60 per cent to 80 per cent profit mar­gin. Moderna has an­nounced it won’t en­force its patents, but the com­pany hasn’t for­got­ten about the profit op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>When­ever it looks as if we’re getting a good deal, it turns out to be an even bet­ter one for the drug com­pa­nies. Even os­ten­si­bly self­less ac­tions might very well turn out to work to the in­dus­try’s ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>True, Ox­ford’s deal with As­traZeneca in­cluded a com­mit­ment to at-cost pric­ing for de­vel­op­ing coun­tries for now. But the Fi­nan­cial Times has re­ported that an agree­ment the com­pany has signed with at least one man­u­fac­turer in­di­cated that this par­tic­u­lar deal could end as soon as July. (The com­pany has said it will seek ex­pert guid­ance as to when it can de­clare an end to the pan­demic.) And As­traZeneca’s deal with Ox­ford, ac­cord­ing to the Fi­nan­cial Times, still al­lows for a healthy profit mar­gin of up to 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>This isn’t sur­pris­ing. The ship has long sailed on the idea that the gi­ants of Amer­i­can cap­i­tal­ism would help any­one with­out ex­tract­ing a fee. Even in this dis­as­ter, even af­ter the un­told sac­ri­fices that mil­lions of or­di­nary peo­ple have made. The real is­sue is not the price – we’ll pay, ob­vi­ously – it is about ac­cess.</p>
    <p>With con­trol over the pro­duc­tion of th­ese vac­cines, th­ese com­pa­nies will largely pro­vide them on their own sched­ule, us­ing their own fac­to­ries or li­censed pro­duc­ers – while other fa­cil­i­ties around the world sit idle. Gov­ern­ments will al­most cer­tainly order more of the ap­proved vac­cines in the weeks and months to come, but the pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity for each com­pany is lim­ited. Com­pa­nies should pledge not only to waive their patents but also to share all their tech­ni­cal knowl­edge so that other man­u­fac­tur­ers can help pro­duce the much-needed vac­cines.</p>
    <p>As it stands, most peo­ple out­side high-risk cat­e­gories likely won’t get vac­ci­nated un­til “later in 2021”, ac­cord­ing to the US Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Pre­ven­tion. Many coun­tries in the global south are ex­pected to be able to vac­ci­nate at most 20 per cent of their pop­u­la­tions by the end of next year. Project the cur­rent daily death toll onto that time­line and de­spair.</p>
    <p>It doesn’t have to be this way. The es­pe­cially galling thing is that mRNA vac­cines were sup­posed to be a dis­rup­tive, lib­er­a­tory tech­nol­ogy. They can be pro­duced faster and more sim­ply, in smaller and cheaper fa­cil­i­ties – ba­sic lab­o­ra­to­ries, even – com­pared with tra­di­tional vac­cines. Sci­en­tists en­vi­sioned a world where vac­cines could be pro­duced quickly, any­where, for a small frac­tion of the tra­di­tional vac­cines’ cost.</p>
    <p>That was be­fore the in­dus­try stepped in.</p>
    <p>Na­tions across the global south are de­mand­ing a sus­pen­sion of pa­tent rights for coro­n­avirus vac­cines, and last month, Amer­i­can aca­demics and ac­tivists – in­clud­ing Ms Chelsea Clin­ton on be­half of the Clin­ton Foun­da­tion, hardly a rev­o­lu­tion­ary out­fit – called for a sim­i­lar plan, in­clud­ing shar­ing patents on vac­cines and al­low­ing world­wide man­u­fac­tur­ing to be­gin. This would prob­a­bly mean not just poorer na­tions but you – the per­son read­ing this – would get vac­ci­nated faster be­cause more vac­cine doses would be pro­duced. None of this is likely to hap­pen.</p>
    <p>I re­call feel­ing, at the start of this pan­demic, both hor­ror at the un­fold­ing calamity, and also a small sense of hope that as in other times of hard­ship, peo­ple would find ways to change the world for the bet­ter. There was talk of com­mu­nity sup­port, mu­tual aid and the re­dis­cov­ery of the pos­i­tive pow­ers of the state to pro­tect its cit­i­zens. Much of that has dimmed now, and it of­ten seems that we sim­ply want re­lief – to go back to the way the world was be­fore, and as soon as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>We have to get back to that place. Yet this may be the best chance in our life­times to break the hold of an in­dus­try that, un­til re­cently, was rightly vil­i­fied. The pub­lic is fol­low­ing th­ese de­vel­op­ments closely, and the state sup­port that un­der­writes phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal prof­its couldn’t be more ob­vi­ous: Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed alone has dis­pensed over US$10 bil­lion to the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Pay it to make the vac­cine, sure. That’s a ser­vice. But we shouldn’t be afraid to de­mand more: Pub­lic sup­port should mean a pub­lic vac­cine, one that reaches peo­ple as quickly as pos­si­ble – prof­itable or not. The phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal in­dus­try wouldn’t be able to rake in its prof­its and re­store its rep­u­ta­tion with­out fund­ing that comes from our tax dol­lars. We shouldn’t let</p>
    <p>Big Pharma for­get it.</p>
    <p>We’ve all been hop­ing for a vac­cine for so long, the mo­ment the medicine is fi­nally be­ing de­liv­ered, it seems al­most per­verse to ques­tion the name on the vial. But the in­dus­try isn’t our saviour. Each of th­ese vac­cine can­di­dates is a com­plex sci­en­tific project with many col­lab­o­ra­tors – and a sub­stan­tial level of state sup­port. Giv­ing the in­dus­try not just plau­dits but also con­trol over the vac­cines them­selves would be a mis­take.</p>
