    <p>China has been ad­vanc­ing by leaps and bounds in re­cent years, as any re­peat vis­i­tor will at­test. But look­ing at the BYD M3e, you would never have guessed.</p>
    <p>The elec­tric seven-seater is the sec­ond car avail­able here from the Shen­zhen-based man­u­fac­turer, fol­low­ing the e6 com­pact mul­ti­pur­pose ve­hi­cle (MPV), which BYD has pro­duced since 2009.</p>
    <p>The M3e, based on the BYD T3 goods van, was in­tro­duced in 2018.</p>
    <p>Both, how­ever, look and feel like they were con­ceived when Mao Ze­dong was still the coun­try’s leader.</p>
    <p>Which is a lit­tle dis­ap­point­ing. Af­ter all, BYD – which stands for Build Your Dreams – started mak­ing elec­tric cars around the same time as Tesla, cur­rently the world’s most valu­able car­maker.</p>
    <p>BYD’s back­ers in­clude Amer­i­can in­vestor ex­traor­di­naire War­ren Buf­fet. The com­pany has made in­roads into com­mer­cial fleets around the world with its elec­tric buses, trucks and fork­lifts.</p>
    <p>But on the pas­sen­ger car front, it is less suc­cess­ful. Be­hind the wheel of the M3e, it is easy to see why.</p>
    <p>The car (a term used loosely here) is so rus­tic and rudi­men­tary it would make a Toy­ota Hi­ace feel like a li­mou­sine. And com­pared with China’s MG ZS elec­tric cross­over, it is de­cid­edly dated.</p>
    <p>Yes, its van-like de­sign is un­pre­ten­tious and the swathe of hard hol­low plas­tic and fake leather lin­ing its in­te­rior kind of com­men­su­rates with its wal­let-friendly price tag.</p>
    <p>But what do you make of crusty switchgear and mys­te­ri­ous sym­bols on the in­stru­men­ta­tion?</p>
    <p>The test-car’s turn sig­nal stalk is flimsy and of­ten fails to en­gage. Its wipers and wind­screen wash­ers are equally flimsy.</p>
    <p>A red bar alert­ing to an un­latched charg­ing port cover re­fuses to go off de­spite re­peated at­tempts to en­sure the lid is shut tight.</p>
    <p>On the go, the same in­stru­men­ta­tion panel flashes an ex­cla­ma­tion mark. Usu­ally, this sig­nals an un­spec­i­fied prob­lem. But in the case of the M3e, it might well be a sign of sur­prise that some­one ac­tu­ally thinks the car has a chance in Sin­ga­pore’s highly com­pet­i­tive mar­ket.</p>
    <p>With rear pas­sen­gers, the seats creak and squeak as the roll-asec­ond chas­sis bounces along the tar­mac.</p>
    <p>Elec­tric cars are usu­ally rather quiet, but the M3e’s mo­tor is vo­cal, emit­ting a loud whine as you throt­tle on. The stereo (again used loosely here), on the other hand, is prob­a­bly the most fee­ble one in town.</p>
    <p>The car is also rel­a­tively slug­gish for an elec­tric ve­hi­cle. But thank­fully, it han­dles de­cently, as long as you re­mem­ber it is a mini­van. The well-cal­i­brated steer­ing is as ef­fort­less and pre­cise as you would find in any mod­ern fam­ily MPV.</p>
    <p>It is ver­sa­tile like an MPV too. Its seat­ing ar­range­ment frees up an aisle for easy ac­cess to var­i­ous rows. The last row can be flipped up to un­leash a size­able cargo area. Slid­ing rear doors make get­ting in and out be­tween parked cars eas­ier.</p>
    <p>The au­tho­rised agent says it will in­stall rear air-con­di­tion­ing vents and a bet­ter sound sys­tem, but those may come with a re­vised price.</p>
    <p>And with a real-world range of close to 300km, the BYD is a us­able fam­ily car­rier in com­pact Sin­ga­pore. Its ac­tual con­sump­tion is around 25kWh/100km, equiv­a­lent to that of sporty elec­tric cars like the Audi e-tron and Jaguar IPace clock.</p>
    <p>But the BYD costs less than a third of ei­ther car. Lastly, the M3e at­tracts an an­nual road tax of $744 – ex­tremely low for an elec­tric car.</p>
    <p>Hence, the M3e is the most ac­ces­si­ble car for green fam­i­lies here – un­til BYD de­cides to let us have the more stylish and car-like Song Max MPV, which it dis­played at the last Sin­ga­pore Mo­tor­show in Jan­uary and which has been in pro­duc­tion since 2017.</p>
