    <p>For­mula One teams are con­fi­dent this sea­son will be com­pleted safely de­spite coun­tries go­ing into lock­down to com­bat the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>There are four races re­main­ing – Turkey and two races in Bahrain fol­lowed by next month’s fi­nale in Abu Dhabi.</p>
    <p>Seven of the teams are based in Eng­land, where the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment an­nounced a new lock­down un­til De­cem­ber on Satur­day, but ex­emp­tions have pre­vi­ously been granted for F1 and are ex­pected to con­tinue.</p>
    <p>Mercedes team prin­ci­pal Toto Wolff told re­porters the mo­tor sport was pre­pared to make ad­just­ments to en­sure the sea­son reaches a sat­is­fac­tory con­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>“The lock­downs that we see in</p>
    <p>Europe now are very dif­fer­ent to the lock­downs in spring,” he said. “It will im­pact our lives, that’s for sure, and it will heav­ily im­pact some in­dus­tries. But we can find a way of work­ing around it.</p>
    <p>“You never know whether we can do all the races that are be­ing left be­cause clearly the health ques­tion comes first.</p>
    <p>“It’s in the hands of the health au­thor­i­ties in the coun­tries that we are vis­it­ing to ac­cept mo­tor rac­ing and host us. If th­ese guys de­cide it’s too much of a risk, then ob­vi­ously, we can’t race there.”</p>
    <p>F1 has raced in Europe since the July sea­son-opener in Aus­tria, with teams tak­ing char­tered flights di­rectly to air­ports near cir­cuits and re­main­ing in a bio-se­cure “bub­ble” dur­ing race week so as to main­tain min­i­mal con­tact with lo­cals and out­siders.</p>
    <p>En­try to the pad­dock is strictly con­trolled, while spec­ta­tors have been barred or greatly re­duced in num­bers and all staff tested reg­u­larly and within 24 hours of ar­rival. Around 60,000 Covid-19 tests have been car­ried out so far with only 54 pos­i­tive re­sults over four months, in­clud­ing two driv­ers, Rac­ing Point pair Ser­gio Perez and Lance Stroll.</p>
    <p>F1’s strict health and safety pro­to­cols mean driv­ers and staff have been ex­empt from quar­an­tine mea­sures, and McLaren boss An­dreas Seidl be­lieves the rest of the cam­paign will go on with­out a hitch.</p>
    <p>“I think we’re still feel­ing quite safe and the health and safety of our peo­ple is pro­tected, which is the most im­por­tant thing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion is quite dy­namic at the mo­ment, there’s no change in any of the plans, we still plan to go ahead with all the races com­ing.”</p>
    <p>At l east eight races must be staged for a cham­pi­onship to be valid and 13 grands prix have al­ready been held this year.</p>
