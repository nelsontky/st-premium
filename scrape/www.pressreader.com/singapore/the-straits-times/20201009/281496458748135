    <p>Vice-Pres­i­dent Mike Pence and Cal­i­for­nia Se­na­tor Ka­mala Har­ris met for the first and only vice-pres­i­den­tial de­bate on Wed­nes­day night in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
    <p>The night un­folded civilly, fea­tur­ing barely any of the ram­pant in­ter­rup­tions and ran­cour that had char­ac­terised the first pres­i­den­tial de­bate be­tween US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den last week.</p>
    <p>Here are some take­aways from Wed­nes­day’s de­bate.</p>
    <p>1 CORO­N­AVIRUS IS TRUMP’S WEAK SPOT</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – which has in­fected more than 7.5 mil­lion Amer­i­cans and killed over 210,000 of them – was fuel for the Democrats’ sharpest crit­i­cism of the night.</p>
    <p>One in five busi­nesses closed, front-line em­ploy­ees were “treated like sac­ri­fi­cial work­ers”, and 30 mil­lion peo­ple had to file for un­em­ploy­ment in the last sev­eral months, said Ms Har­ris.</p>
    <p>She called the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s re­sponse “the great­est fail­ure of any ad­min­is­tra­tion in the his­tory of our coun­try”, ac­cus­ing it of cov­er­ing up the pan­demic and ar­gu­ing that it still did not have a plan.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence, who heads the White House’s coro­n­avirus task force, was asked why the United States’ death toll as a per­cent­age of its pop­u­la­tion was higher than al­most ev­ery other wealthy coun­try.</p>
    <p>He replied that Mr Trump’s ban on trav­ellers from China bought time for a na­tional mo­bil­i­sa­tion of re­sources to com­bat the out­break, with­out which even more lives would have been lost.</p>
    <p>2 CHINA RE­PEAT­EDLY USED AS A BOGEYMAN</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign has re­peat­edly tried to paint Mr Bi­den as soft on China, and Wed­nes­day was no ex­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence re­peat­edly called Mr Bi­den a “cheerleade­r for China” and said that the Demo­crat would re­peal tar­iffs on Chi­nese goods if elected.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris said Mr Trump had lost his trade war with China, while Mr Pence replied that Mr Bi­den never fought it.</p>
    <p>Asked how he would describe Amer­ica’s fun­da­men­tal re­la­tion­ship with China, Mr Pence said that China was to blame for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Asked the same ques­tion, Ms Har­ris pivoted to ar­gu­ing that Amer­ica’s stand­ing in the world had di­min­ished un­der Mr Trump’s pres­i­dency, adding that Mr Bi­den wanted to re­store Amer­i­can lead­er­ship and al­liances.</p>
    <p>“Lead­ers of all of our for­merly al­lied coun­tries have now de­cided that they hold in greater es­teem and re­spect Xi Jin­ping, the head of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party, than they do Don­ald Trump,” said Ms Har­ris, cit­ing a sur­vey by the Pew Re­search Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>3 A MO­MEN­TARY RE­TURN TO A PRE-TRUMP DEMOC­RACY</p>
    <p>There were min­i­mal in­ter­rup­tions in Wed­nes­day’s de­bate. Mr Pence and Ms Har­ris mostly let each other fin­ish their sen­tences. They en­gaged with most of the mod­er­a­tor’s ques­tions – even if they did not an­swer them – and had ac­tual dis­cus­sions about pol­icy pro­pos­als and track records.</p>
    <p>That made the de­bate a far cry from last week’s ver­bal dust-up be­tween Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den. Po­lit­i­cal ob­servers noted that it felt like a brief re­turn to the norms of ci­vil­ity flouted by Mr Trump and, to a lesser ex­tent, his po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence’s calmer de­meanour, in con­trast to that of his run­ning mate, could very well calm vot­ers who are skit­tish about Mr Trump’s tem­per­a­ment.</p>
    <p>4 WHAT WENT UN­SAID</p>
    <p>The points that each can­di­date in­sisted on press­ing home, and the ques­tions that they dodged over the course of the night, were re­veal­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Pence re­peat­edly in­sisted that Mr Bi­den would ban frack­ing – drilling down into the earth to ex­tract oil or nat­u­ral gas – and raise taxes, forc­ing Ms Har­ris to stress more than once that he would not.</p>
    <p>A be­lief among vot­ers that Mr Bi­den would ban frack­ing, which is a ma­jor in­dus­try in the swing state of Penn­syl­va­nia, may hurt his chances of vic­tory there.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris, on her part, evaded a ques­tion on whether the Democrats would pack the Supreme Court – that is, in­crease the num­ber of seats from the cur­rent nine – in a bid to di­lute the ex­pected con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity.</p>
