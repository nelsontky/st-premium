    <p>Live per­for­mances can be held at per­form­ing arts venues and the premises of orches­tras, choirs, dance groups, and other arts and cul­ture or­gan­i­sa­tions come Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Art gal­leries and some mu­se­ums, as well as com­mu­nity cen­tres and ho­tel ball­rooms and func­tion rooms are among venues per­mit­ted to re­sume live per­for­mances, ac­cord­ing to the up­date by the Na­tional Arts Coun­cil (NAC) on its web­site yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This comes af­ter the suc­cess­ful pi­lot of live per­for­mances tri­alled since Sept 11.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong urged peo­ple to “go out (safely of course!) and sup­port our artistes whole­heart­edly”.</p>
    <p>He said live per­for­mances are the “lifeblood of our arts and cul­tural sec­tor” and they are also the most sus­tain­able way to pre­serve a craft and main­tain liveli­hoods.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong said: “Over the last few weeks, I met so many artists who yearn for the stage again. It is of course about liveli­hoods, but to many, it is not just about that. They just want to dance, sing, act. Per­form. For an au­di­ence.”</p>
    <p>He added that even as live per­for­mances re­sume, the safety of per­form­ers and au­di­ences re­mains the top pri­or­ity.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers can host up to two zones of 50 au­di­ence mem­bers each per per­for­mance, with safe man­age­ment mea­sures in place.</p>
    <p>There should be a safe dis­tance of 3m be­tween the au­di­ence and per­form­ers, and all per­form­ers should main­tain a dis­tance of at least 1m from one another. At any given time, a max­i­mum of 30 per­form­ers and crew are al­lowed on stage and back­stage, and only up to 10 of them can be unmasked.</p>
    <p>From Nov 24, those watch­ing live per­for­mances must check in to SafeEn­try with the TraceTo­gether app or to­ken.</p>
    <p>“The wide­spread use of TraceTo­gether in these venues will al­low quicker con­tact trac­ing and ringfenc­ing of any in­fec­tions,” said NAC.</p>
    <p>In the light of the in­creased al­lowance for au­di­ences, the Sin­ga­pore Reper­tory Theatre (SRT) and Wild Rice have both added to their re­spec­tive runs for Tues­days With Mor­rie and An Ac­tress Pre­pares. The two shows sold out quickly when tick­ets were first re­leased.</p>
    <p>SRT has added more shows for Tues­days With Mor­rie un­til Dec 6 and opened up cir­cle seats for shows from Nov 5. Wild Rice has added 40 tick­ets per show – a to­tal of 920 new tick­ets – for An Ac­tress Pre­pares, which is on from Nov 4 to 22.</p>
    <p>Venues man­aged by the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion can also have live per­for­mances from next month, as can mu­se­ums man­aged by the Na­tional Her­itage Board as well as those which are Mu­seum Round­table mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Re­sorts World Sen­tosa, Ma­rina Bay Sands and tourist at­trac­tions which have been given the green light by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board to re­sume op­er­a­tions can also have in­door live per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>Live per­for­mances will also be al­lowed at Mice (meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions) events held at Changi Ex­hi­bi­tion Cen­tre, Sin­ga­pore Expo and Sun­tec con­ven­tion cen­tre.</p>
    <p>How­ever, live per­for­mances are still not al­lowed to re­sume in food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ments and at wed­ding re­cep­tions re­gard­less of the venue, said NAC. This is due to the higher like­li­hood of pa­trons min­gling and talk­ing while unmasked.</p>
    <p>Venue own­ers can log on to the Gov­ern­ment’s Go Busi­ness plat­form from Sun­day us­ing Cor­pPass to con­firm whether they can host an in­door live per­for­mance.</p>
