    <p>The heavy­weight cham­pion in the Ul­ti­mate Fighting Cham­pi­onship (UFC) is of­ten dubbed the “bad­dest man on the planet”, but Ciryl Gane is on a quest to prove there is no rea­son why he can­not also be one of the friendli­est.</p>
    <p>The French­man is 1.96m and 110kg of toned mus­cle but also armed with a megawatt smile. He made his UFC de­but in Au­gust last year and has quickly risen to No. 14 in the heavy­weight list, win­ning all three of his fights con­vinc­ingly.</p>
    <p>A fourth vic­tory – he faces Ju­nior dos San­tos at the UFC 256 event to­day – will strengthen the hype around him as he tar­gets Amer­i­can Stipe Mio­cic’s ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The up­com­ing bout will be Gane’s only one this year af­ter a slew of post­pone­ments and can­cel­la­tions (five in all) against dif­fer­ent mooted op­po­nents, but there is no doubt he is fac­ing the big­gest name in his bur­geon­ing ca­reer in for­mer cham­pion dos San­tos in Las Ve­gas.</p>
    <p>“Yeah, it’s been a crazy year,” the 30-year-old Gane told The Straits Times in a re­cent Zoom in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“But if I win this fight, it would be a good year for me.”</p>
    <p>Un­like his peers, you will not find Gane scowl­ing or pre­sent­ing a brusque ex­te­rior. He an­swers ques­tions with a thought­ful pause and usu­ally a dis­arm­ing smile. Lit­tle won­der his nick­name is ‘Bon Gamin’, or French for ‘Good Kid’.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained he was given the moniker by his team­mates at the MMA Factory gym in Paris, be­cause of his friendly na­ture. He is quick to add: “But when I am in the cage, I am a dif­fer­ent per­son.”</p>
    <p>His rise in the UFC, the world’s big­gest mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) or­gan­i­sa­tion, is re­mark­able con­sid­er­ing he has prac­tised com­bat sport for only six years, and trained in MMA for just over two.</p>
    <p>He was study­ing in a Brevet de tech­ni­cien su­perieur – French diploma of higher ed­u­ca­tion – busi­ness pro­gramme in 2014 when he de­cided to join a class­mate for Muay Thai train­ing.</p>
    <p>De­spite play­ing only bas­ket­ball and foot­ball be­fore dip­ping his toes into fighting, Gane ex­celled. Fighting is in his blood though – his fa­ther and grand­fa­ther were small-time pro­fes­sional box­ers.</p>
    <p>“Plus, even when I played foot­ball and bas­ket­ball, I al­ways liked the con­tact,” he said with a chuckle, while mim­ick­ing throw­ing el­bows.</p>
    <p>In three years, he racked up 13 straight wins in Muay Thai bouts. In June 2018, un­der the ad­vice of his coach Fer­nand Lopez, he switched to MMA and is un­de­feated in six con­tests.</p>
    <p>He ad­mit­ted it was a strug­gle ini­tially to make the tran­si­tion from Muay Thai, which is purely strik­ing-based, to MMA, which in­cor­po­rates grap­pling and sub­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>He was a quick learner and earned the Per­for­mance of the Night bonus of US$25,000 (S$33,346) at the Fight Night: Askren v Maia event in Oc­to­ber last year at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium. He dom­i­nated Amer­i­can fighter Don’Tale Mayes for three rounds be­fore adding the per­fect fin­ish­ing touch with a su­perb heel hook sub­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>No won­der he has fond mem­o­ries of the Repub­lic – “a re­ally nice place, where the peo­ple are re­ally cool” is his de­scrip­tion – and said he would love to re­turn for an­other fight.</p>
    <p>The im­pend­ing vac­uum in the heavy­weight di­vi­sion will also help Gane’s chances.</p>
    <p>Mio­cic turned 38 in Au­gust – the same month for­mer cham­pion Daniel Cormier, 41, called time on his ca­reer – and is con­sid­er­ing re­tire­ment while a num­ber of vet­er­ans in the top 10 are also likely to exit the sport soon.</p>
    <p>Gane has im­pressed many MMA fans and ob­servers, and dos San­tos, who holds the long­est UFC heavy­weight win streak of nine and has beaten all-time greats like Mirko Cro Cop, Cain Ve­lasquez and Mio­cic, has even said Gane re­minds the Brazil­ian of him­self.</p>
    <p>“It (the sit­u­a­tion at heavy­weight) is re­ally in­ter­est­ing, but I just want to do my job step by step,” said Gane.</p>
    <p>“There are a lot of good guys in front of me. If I win my next fight, it’s go­ing to be re­ally fast (be­fore a ti­tle shot ar­rives). But I’m ready. For real, I’m con­fi­dent.”</p>
    <p>Noth­ing would make him smile more than reach­ing the UFC sum­mit.</p>
    <p>I just want to do my job step by step. There are a lot of good guys in front of me... But I’m ready. For real, I’m con­fi­dent.</p>
    <p>CIRYL GANE, who is ranked 14th in the UFC’s heavy­weight list.</p>

        <p data-role="text">French&#xAD;man Ciryl Gane is go&#xAD;ing for a fourth straight UFC heavy&#xAD;weight win to&#xAD;day when he faces Ju&#xAD;nior dos San&#xAD;tos in Las Ve&#xAD;gas. This is his only fight in a sea&#xAD;son se&#xAD;verely dis&#xAD;rupted by the coro&#xAD;n&#xAD;avirus pan&#xAD;demic and he says &#x201C;a crazy year&#x201D; will be&#xAD;come a good one if he comes out on top.</p>
