    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese an­i­mated film De­mon Slayer shat­tered a box-of­fice record, reach­ing rev­enue of 10.75 bil­lion yen (S$139.4 mil­lion) in just 10 days, the film’s dis­trib­u­tor said on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>That was the fastest pace for ticket sales in Ja­pan to top 10 bil­lion yen, best­ing the pre­vi­ous record­holder, di­rec­tor Hayao Miyazaki’s 2001 an­i­mated film Spir­ited Away, which took 25 days to reach the mile­stone.</p>
    <p>The an­i­mated film, whose full ti­tle is De­mon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba The Movie – Mu­gen Train, had al­ready bro­ken the coun­try’s pre­vi­ous record for best three-day open­ing when it hit cin­e­mas on Oct 16.</p>
    <p>In what may be a first for Ja­pan, the movie had the big­gest open­ing in the world two week­ends ago – more t han all other coun­tries com­bined – de­spite hav­ing de­buted only do­mes­ti­cally.</p>
    <p>The movie, based on a pop­u­lar manga, is set in Ja­pan roughly 100 years ago, about a boy who fights hu­man-eat­ing demons.</p>
    <p>It is a di­rect se­quel to the an­ime se­ries De­mon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba, which is avail­able on Net­flix.</p>
    <p>Co-dis­trib­u­tor Ani­plex said 7.98 mil­lion peo­ple had seen the film as of Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The movie had been hotly an­tic­i­pated for months by Ja­panese fans and an in­dus­try des­per­ate to get movie­go­ers back in front of big screens amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has kept coro­n­avirus cases and deaths low, with a rel­a­tively light touch that re­lies on con­tact trac­ing and ap­peals to a na­tional sense of so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The daily num­ber of new cases in Ja­pan has stayed be­low 800 since the end of Au­gust and, in Tokyo, daily life, at least on the sur­face, has mostly re­turned to nor­mal.</p>
    <p>For the coun­try’s top politi­cians, the star­tling box-of­fice num­bers were a barom­e­ter for Ja­pan’s weath­er­ing of the pan­demic and its ef­forts to restart the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>It was the rare car­toon that re­ceived an en­thu­si­as­tic re­view from not one, but two, Ja­panese Cabi­net min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>The top gov­ern­ment spokesman, Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Kat­sunobu Kato, told re­porters that the movie had made an “ex­tremely large con­tri­bu­tion to the film in­dus­try”.</p>
    <p>On Twit­ter, Mr Ya­su­toshi Nishimura, who heads the coun­try’s eco­nomic re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts, called it “a spec­tac­u­lar achieve­ment for the worlds of cul­ture and en­ter­tain­ment as they strug­gle with the coro­n­avirus”.</p>
