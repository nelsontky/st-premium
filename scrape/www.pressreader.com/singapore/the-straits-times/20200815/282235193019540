    <p>• Ap­ple and Al­pha­bet’s Google on Thurs­day re­moved pop­u­lar video game Fort­nite from their app stores for vi­o­lat­ing the com­pa­nies’ in-app pay­ment guide­lines, prompt­ing de­vel­oper Epic Games to file fed­eral an­titrust law­suits chal­leng­ing the two com­pa­nies’ rules.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple and Google cited a di­rect pay­ment fea­ture rolled out on the Fort­nite app ear­lier on Thurs­day as the vi­o­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Epic sued in the US court seek­ing no money from Ap­ple or Google but rather in­junc­tions that would end many of the com­pa­nies’ prac­tices re­lated to their app stores.</p>
    <p>“Ap­ple has be­come what it once railed against: the be­he­moth seek­ing to con­trol markets, block com­pe­ti­tion and sti­fle in­no­va­tion. Ap­ple is big­ger, more pow­er­ful, more en­trenched and more per­ni­cious than the mo­nop­o­lists of yes­ter­year,” Epic said in its law­suit, filed in the North­ern District of Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Epic also at­tacked Ap­ple on so­cial me­dia, launch­ing a cam­paign with the hash­tag #FreeFort­nite, urg­ing play­ers to seek re­funds from Ap­ple if they lose ac­cess to the game, and cre­at­ing a par­ody of Ap­ple’s fa­mous “1984” tele­vi­sion ad­ver­tise­ment.</p>
    <p>In the par­ody, which quickly gar­nered hun­dreds of thou­sands of views, a fe­male Fort­nite fighter hurls a uni­corn-shaped club to smash a screen on which an Ap­ple­headed char­ac­ter speaks of “the an­niver­sary of the plat­form uni­fi­ca­tion di­rec­tives”.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple takes a cut of be­tween 15 per cent and 30 per cent for most app sub­scrip­tions and pay­ments made in­side apps, though there are some ex­cep­tions for com­pa­nies that al­ready have a credit card on file for iPhone cus­tomers if they also of­fer an in-app pay­ment that would ben­e­fit Ap­ple.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts be­lieve games are the big­gest con­trib­u­tor to spend­ing in­side the App Store, which is in turn the largest com­po­nent of Ap­ple’s ser­vices seg­ment worth US$46.3 bil­lion (S$63.6 bil­lion) a year.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Ap­ple said Fort­nite had been re­moved be­cause Epic had launched the pay­ment fea­ture with the “ex­press in­tent of vi­o­lat­ing the App Store guide­lines” after hav­ing had apps in the store for a decade.</p>
    <p>“The fact that their (Epic) busi­ness in­ter­ests now lead them to push for a spe­cial ar­range­ment does not change the fact that these guide­lines cre­ate a level play­ing field for all de­vel­op­ers and make the store safe for all users,” Ap­ple said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Google also re­moved Fort­nite from its Play Store, but did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment on the law­suit. “How­ever, we wel­come the op­por­tu­nity to con­tinue our dis­cus­sions with Epic and bring Fort­nite back to</p>
    <p>Google Play,” Google spokesman Dan Jack­son said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>He said Epic had vi­o­lated a rule re­quir­ing de­vel­op­ers to use Google’s in-app billing sys­tem for prod­ucts within video games.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple and Google were among the ma­jor Amer­i­can tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies to come un­der anti-com­pe­ti­tion scru­tiny in a hear­ing be­fore law­mak­ers last month. Dur­ing the hear­ing, Ap­ple chief ex­ec­u­tive Tim Cook ar­gued that the firm is not anti-com­pet­i­tive be­cause it does not have ma­jor­ity mar­ket share in any mar­ket where it op­er­ates, such as mo­bile phones, where de­vices pow­ered by Al­pha­bet’s An­droid have greater mar­ket share.</p>
    <p>Epic’s law­suit, how­ever, ar­gues that app dis­tri­bu­tion and in-app pay­ments for Ap­ple de­vices con­sti­tute their own dis­tinct mar­ket for anti-com­pe­ti­tion pur­poses be­cause Ap­ple users rarely leave its “sticky” ecosys­tem, ac­cord­ing to Epic’s fil­ing.</p>
    <p>Epic’s free-to-play bat­tle-royal video game Fort­nite has reached mas­sive pop­u­lar­ity among young gamers since its launch in 2017, and com­petes with Ten­cent Hold­ings’ Play­erUn­known’s Bat­tle­grounds.</p>
    <p>The ti­tle’s re­moval from the App Store means that new play­ers will not be able to down­load it and that ex­it­ing play­ers can­not re­ceive up­dates, but the game should con­tinue to work on de­vices where it is al­ready in­stalled.</p>
    <p>Epic does not dis­close how many iOS users Fort­nite has. Many fans play the game pri­mar­ily on per­sonal com­put­ers or gam­ing con­soles while us­ing their mo­bile phones as a backup, but iPhone users gen­er­ate far more rev­enue for Epic.</p>
    <p>In both Ap­ple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store, Fort­nite had about two mil­lion down­loads last month, ac­cord­ing to mo­bile an­a­lyt­ics firm Sen­sorTower.</p>

Epic Games, maker of pop&#xAD;u&#xAD;lar video game Fort&#xAD;nite, cre&#xAD;ated the par&#xAD;ody after Ap&#xAD;ple re&#xAD;moved the game from its App Store for vi&#xAD;o&#xAD;lat&#xAD;ing its in-app pay&#xAD;ment guide&#xAD;lines.
