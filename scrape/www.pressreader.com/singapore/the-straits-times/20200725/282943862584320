    <p>TAY­LOR SWIFT RE­LEASES</p>
    <p>NEW AL­BUM: Amer­i­can pop singer Tay­lor Swift (above) sur­prised fans by re­leas­ing her eighth al­bum, Folk­lore, yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She wrote on her so­cial me­dia pages: “Most of the things I had planned this sum­mer didn’t end up hap­pen­ing, but there is some­thing I hadn’t planned on that did hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>The al­bum com­prises 16 songs, which the 30-year-old had “poured all of my whims, dreams, fears and mus­ings into”.</p>
    <p>While the songs were writ­ten and recorded while she was in iso­la­tion, she also re­vealed a list of other mu­si­cians whom she looked up and also worked with on the al­bum. They in­clude in­die and al­ter­na­tive acts</p>
    <p>Aaron Dess­ner from The Na­tional and Bon Iver, as well as long-time col­lab­o­ra­tor Jack Antonoff.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing her fans, Swift said she used to fret over find­ing the perfect re­lease date for new mu­sic. With­out go­ing into specifics, she added that “the times we’re liv­ing in” have re­minded her that “noth­ing is guar­an­teed”.</p>
    <p>“My in­stinct is telling me that if you make some­thing you love, you should just put it out into the world. That’s the side of un­cer­tainty I can get on board with.”</p>
