    <p>Ms Kala Narayanasa­my’s mantra in nurs­ing is to ask her­self how she can make things “safer, faster and better” for her pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Now the deputy di­rec­tor of nurs­ing at Wood­lands Health Cam­pus, Ms Kala had re­tired in 2010 but soon re­turned to the pro­fes­sion she joined in 1982.</p>
    <p>“We come from a gen­er­a­tion where we of­ten stay in the same job through­out the years and, as a re­sult, we grow roots in our ca­reer,” said the 59-year-old.</p>
    <p>A year af­ter re­tire­ment, in 2011, a former col­league asked her to lead the nurs­ing team at Ren Ci Nurs­ing Home. Ms Kala agreed, and while there she took part in a project to im­prove oral hy­giene among the home’s el­derly pa­tients.</p>
    <p>In 2012, Ms Kala landed her­self the role of nurse ed­u­ca­tor at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal, where she groomed and men­tored younger nurses, hop­ing to shape them into future lead­ers in nurs­ing.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways told my nurses that they must know ev­ery­thing about their pa­tients dur­ing their shift, and they must be able to of­fer each pa­tient... the el­e­ment of hu­man touch.”</p>
    <p>Quot­ing Florence Nightin­gale, Ms Kala of­ten re­minded those she men­tored that “once the pa­tients have no needs at all, that’s when you know you’ve done a good job”.</p>
    <p>Aside from her role in nur­tur­ing a younger gen­er­a­tion of nurses, Ms Kala also re­de­fined and stream­lined ex­ist­ing work pro­cesses to im­prove ef­fi­ciency at hos­pi­tals, which trans­lates to a safer and better ex­pe­ri­ence for nurses and pa­tients alike.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in or­der to help pa­tients re­cover faster and shorten their hos­pi­tal stays, Ms Kala pushed her nurses to en­cour­age early phys­io­ther­apy, which helped in­stil greater confidence in the pa­tients.</p>
    <p>In 2017, she joined Wood­lands Health Cam­pus, where she is lever­ag­ing her four decades of ex­pe­ri­ence along­side other nurs­ing lead­ers to de­velop nurs­ing ser­vices ahead of its open­ing in 2022.</p>
    <p>Ten years af­ter her brief re­tire­ment, each project and role at dif­fer­ent health­care in­sti­tu­tions since has been a re­fresh­ing chal­lenge, said Ms Kala.</p>
