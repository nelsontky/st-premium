    <p>Rev­ellers in Tokyo rang in the festive sea­son by crowd­ing shop­ping dis­tricts, pack­ing Christ­mas mar­kets and throng­ing il­lu­mi­na­tion events with barely a thought for so­cial dis­tanc­ing, po­ten­tially com­pro­mis­ing of­fi­cial ef­forts to rein in surg­ing Covid-19 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Tokyo set a new sin­gle-day high of 949 new Covid-19 cases yesterday, bust­ing its pre­vi­ous, two-day­old high of 888 on Christ­mas Eve.</p>
    <p>On Christ­mas Day, 884 new in­fec­tions were re­ported.</p>
    <p>The coun­try recorded at least 3,877 cases yesterday, the fourth straight day that the na­tional record has been rewrit­ten.</p>
    <p>Nearly half the cases were in Tokyo and the neigh­bour­ing pre­fec­tures of Kana­gawa (480), Saitama (265) and Chiba (201).</p>
    <p>There were 654 se­ri­ously ill pa­tients na­tion­wide as at yesterday, also a new record.</p>
    <p>Given the surge in cases, Ja­pan said last night that it will ban en­try into the coun­try for all ex­cept cit­i­zens and re­turn­ing for­eign na­tion­als from to­mor­row un­til the end of next month.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish vari­ant of the coro­n­avirus, said to be up to 70 per cent more con­ta­gious, was de­tected in the cap­i­tal yesterday.</p>
    <p>Two of Tokyo’s 949 new in­fec­tions were due to the Bri­tish mu­ta­tion: An air­craft cap­tain in his 30s who re­turned from Britain re­cently but was not de­tected at the air­port, and a fe­male fam­ily</p>
    <p>mem­ber. The Health Min­istry is in­ves­ti­gat­ing if there are close con­tacts.</p>
    <p>The two cases fol­lowed Fri­day’s con­fir­ma­tion of Ja­pan’s first five cases of the more trans­mis­si­ble vari­ant by air­port quar­an­tine of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>They all in­volved peo­ple who had re­turned from Britain.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga</p>
    <p>ad­vised peo­ple on Fri­day to spend the year-end pe­riod qui­etly and re­frain from tra­di­tional so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties such as large gath­er­ings and drink­ing par­ties.</p>
    <p>He did not rule out call­ing a sec­ond state of emer­gency if the sit­u­a­tion con­tin­ued to spiral out of con­trol.</p>
    <p>But these of­fi­cial warn­ings and</p>
    <p>ad­vi­sories to spend the festive sea­son qui­etly may fall on deaf ears.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple go­ing out in Tokyo this month re­mains at pre-pan­demic lev­els even as new cases surge.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen whether met­ro­pol­i­tan ar­eas wi l l be crowded with peo­ple cel­e­brat­ing the New Year, though the dis­con­tin­u­a­tion of the Go To Travel do­mes­tic tourism cam­paign has de­terred many from re­turn­ing to their home towns for fam­ily gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Ky­odo News cited air­lines as say­ing that reser­va­tions for do­mes­tic flights be­tween Christ­mas and Jan 3 were down 45 per cent from a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Book­ings for shinkansen and ex­press trains were down 61 per cent from Dec 9 to Jan 5.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has had rel­a­tively re­laxed Covid-19 guide­lines – Mr Suga said on Fri­day that he plans to toughen them by revising laws to pun­ish busi­nesses that refuse to com­ply with re­quests to shorten op­er­at­ing hours.</p>
    <p>More over­sight might also be needed on quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Those on self-iso­la­tion at home in Ja­pan can go out for brief pe­ri­ods to run er­rands at con­ve­nience stores or su­per­mar­kets. The au­thor­i­ties rarely check in – if ever.</p>
    <p>A con­firmed Covid-19 case – a man in his 20s who works in the in­ves­ti­ga­tion de­part­ment of the Tokyo Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors’ Of­fice – skipped quar­an­tine de­spite be­ing on self-iso­la­tion un­til to­day.</p>
    <p>He trav­elled to Fukuoka via high­way bus. While de­tails on when he left are un­avail­able, Deputy Pros­e­cu­tor Hiroshi Ya­mamoto de­nounced the be­hav­iour as “ex­tremely in­ap­pro­pri­ate”.</p>
