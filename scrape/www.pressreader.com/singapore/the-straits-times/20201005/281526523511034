    <p>Strikes con­ducted by Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan on civil­ian ar­eas out­side the break­away re­gion of Nagorno-Karabakh are threat­en­ing to spark an all-out war be­tween the two for­mer Soviet re­publics. Ar­me­nia yes­ter­day claimed to have struck a mil­i­tary air­port in Ganja, Azer­bai­jan’s sec­ond-largest city.</p>
    <p>Strikes con­ducted by Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan on civil­ian pop­u­la­tion cen­tres out­side the break­away re­gion of Nagorno-Karabakh are threat­en­ing to spark off an all-out war be­tween the two for­mer Soviet re­publics.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia yes­ter­day claimed to have struck a mil­i­tary air­port in Azer­bai­jan’s sec­ond-largest city of Ganja, which caused at least one civil­ian death. The rocket at­tack was ap­par­ently in re­tal­i­a­tion for Azer­bai­jan bomb­ing Stepanaker­t, the largest city in NagornoKar­abakh, and Mar­dak­ert.</p>
    <p>Prior to the lat­est at­tack, Azer­bai­jan had claimed that Ar­me­nian shelling had killed civil­ians in other ar­eas un­der its con­trol. Ar­me­nia has also re­ported deaths in its own ter­ri­tory due to Az­eri strikes.</p>
    <p>Mr Zakir Hasanov, the Az­eri De­fence Min­is­ter, warned yes­ter­day that the at­tack by Ar­me­nia “ex­pands the the­atre of con­flict”.</p>
    <p>WHAT THE DIS­PUTE IS ABOUT</p>
    <p>A war broke out be­tween Azer­bai­jan and Ar­me­nia around the time of the break-up of the Soviet Union af­ter sep­a­ratists seized NagornoKar­abakh and seven sur­round­ing re­gions from Azer­bai­jan.</p>
    <p>The eth­nic Ar­me­nian en­clave was nearly crushed be­fore a se­ries of vic­to­ries that led up to a cease­fire in 1994. The ne­go­ti­a­tions that led to an un­easy truce were spear­headed by the so-called Minsk Group, set up by the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Se­cu­rity and Co­op­er­a­tion in Europe to me­di­ate be­tween Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan and co-chaired by the United States, Rus­sia and France.</p>
    <p>De­spite the cease­fire, Azer­bai­jan had vowed to re­cap­ture the area, and skir­mishes have taken place fre­quently. Fresh con­flict broke out on Sept 27 af­ter Ar­me­nia claimed that Azer­bai­jan had mounted an un­pro­voked of­fen­sive. Baku, on the other hand, claimed that Ar­me­nia shelled its po­si­tions first.</p>
    <p>WHY IT MAT­TERS</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of peo­ple have been re­port­edly killed and scores wounded in pitched bat­tles that have seen the use of tanks and fighter jets. The strikes on civil­ian pop­u­la­tion cen­tres in ter­ri­to­ries out­side NagornoKar­abakh could be the pre­cur­sor to an all-out war be­tween the na­tions.</p>
    <p>Hopes had risen of a cease­fire be­ing de­clared af­ter Yere­van said it was agree­able to me­di­a­tion by Rus­sia, France and the United States.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mus­lim-ma­jor­ity Azer­bai­jan’s key ally Turkey has threat­ened to put a span­ner in the works, ar­gu­ing that it was un­ac­cept­able that the Minsk Group should have a say in any peace talks af­ter ne­glect­ing the sit­u­a­tion for so long.</p>
    <p>Turkey’s al­leged mil­i­tary in­volve­ment in the re­newed con­flict is threat­en­ing to spark off a wider con­fla­gra­tion, even as global pow­ers seek a diplo­matic res­o­lu­tion to end the worst fight­ing since the 1990s.</p>
    <p>Sus­pi­cions about di­rect Turk­ish in­ter­ven­tion in the bat­tles were raised af­ter Ar­me­nia an­nounced that one of its Rus­sian-built SU-25 fighter jets had been shot down by a Turk­ish F-16 early last week.</p>
    <p>Both Turkey and Azer­bai­jan de­nied that a Turk­ish mil­i­tary plane had been re­spon­si­ble for down­ing the air­craft – with Baku al­leg­ing that the pi­lot had flown into a moun­tain – but an ac­cu­sa­tion by France on Thurs­day that Turkey was in­tro­duc­ing Syr­ian mer­ce­nar­ies into the con­flict has set alarm bells ring­ing.</p>
    <p>Turkey is­sued an im­me­di­ate re­jec­tion of the French al­le­ga­tions, but has made no se­cret of its back­ing for Azer­bai­jan, with Turk­ish Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan sig­nalling his de­sired out­come from the con­flict. “It is time to end the cri­sis in the re­gion, which started with the oc­cu­pa­tion of NagornoKar­abakh. The re­gion will once again see peace af­ter Ar­me­nia im­me­di­ately with­draws from the Az­eri lands it is oc­cu­py­ing,” he told an event in Is­tan­bul early last week.</p>
    <p>French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron has ac­cused Turkey of act­ing in a “war­like” man­ner. France says it has in­for­ma­tion which in­di­cates that Syr­ian fight­ers from Is­lamist groups have tran­sited through Gaziantep, in south-east­ern Turkey, to reach NagornoKar­abakh.</p>
    <p>That mir­rored a warn­ing by Rus­sia’s For­eign Min­istry last Wed­nes­day that Syr­ian and Libyan fight­ers from il­le­gal armed groups were be­ing sent into the con­flict zone.</p>
    <p>The im­me­di­ate con­cern raised by the al­leged Turk­ish par­tic­i­pa­tion in the grow­ing con­flict is that Rus­sia might feel pres­sured to stage an in­ter­ven­tion on be­half of its ally Ar­me­nia.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has a mil­i­tary base in Chris­tian-ma­jor­ity Ar­me­nia, and con­sid­ers the na­tion to be a strate­gic part­ner. The two coun­tries also have a mu­tual de­fence pact.</p>
    <p>There are al­ready sore spots in Rus­sia’s re­la­tions with Turkey, namely the con­flicts in Syria and Libya in which the two mil­i­tary gi­ants have found them­selves on op­pos­ing sides, which could mo­ti­vate Moscow to get in­volved.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, hav­ing played a part in bro­ker­ing the 1994 cease­fire that halted the war, Rus­sia has for the time be­ing sought to play peace bro­ker in the dis­pute.</p>
    <p>WHAT’S NEXT</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Mr Putin is­sued a joint call with Mr Macron and US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump for Ar­me­ni­ans and Azer­bai­ja­nis to halt their fight­ing, urg­ing the two sides to “com­mit with­out de­lay to re­sum­ing sub­stan­tive ne­go­ti­a­tions, in good faith and with­out pre­con­di­tions”.</p>
    <p>But hours be­fore the joint state­ment, Mr Er­do­gan said he op­posed their in­volve­ment. “Given that the USA, Rus­sia and France have ne­glected this prob­lem for nearly 30 years, it is un­ac­cept­able that they are in­volved in a search for a cease­fire,” he told the Turk­ish Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Other global and re­gional pow­ers have also sought to defuse the sit­u­a­tion. Nei­ther Ar­me­nia nor Azer­bai­jan is show­ing signs of back­ing down, how­ever, and both have claimed lim­ited suc­cess in the con­flict thus far.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan claims to have taken sev­eral vil­lages con­trolled by Ar­me­nian forces. Ar­me­nia, on the other hand, claims that its counter at­tacks have suc­cess­fully neu­tralised dozens of Az­eri tanks, air­craft and drones in in­tense bat­tles that have been cap­tured in video footage.</p>
    <p>There are signs both Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan are dig­ging in for the long haul. Azer­bai­jani Pres­i­dent Il­ham Aliyev has said that he’s call­ing up “tens of thou­sands” of re­servists. Baku has also im­posed mil­i­tary rule and a cur­few in large cities. Mean­while, Ar­me­nia de­clared mar­tial law and to­tal mil­i­tary mo­bil­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The stakes are high: Be­fore the 1994 cease­fire was de­clared, about 30,000 peo­ple were killed in the Ar­me­nia-Azer­bai­jan con­flict and more than a mil­lion peo­ple were dis­placed. Whether such large-scale loss of life and de­struc­tion takes place again will hinge on the in­ter­na­tional ef­fort to bring about at least a ten­u­ous peace.</p>
