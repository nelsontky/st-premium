    <p>Like most coun­tries, the im­pact of Covid-19 on Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties has been se­vere. In the sec­ond quar­ter of this year, the Repub­lic’s econ­omy ex­pe­ri­enced a his­toric con­trac­tion of 13.2 per cent.</p>
    <p>At this run rate, the an­nu­alised rate rep­re­sents a con­trac­tion of 42.9 per cent in eco­nomic out­put.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket an­a­lysts and econ­o­mists have been us­ing short­hand to de­scribe var­i­ous “shapes” of eco­nomic re­cov­ery – such as Vshaped, L-shaped, W-shaped and even K-shaped – to char­ac­terise the tra­jec­tory of the gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) that lies ahead of us.</p>
    <p>These sig­nal dif­fer­ent lev­els of op­ti­mism and the un­der­ly­ing longterm ef­fects of the pandemic.</p>
    <p>The most op­ti­mistic sit­u­a­tion is a V-shaped re­cov­ery, which treats the cur­rent pandemic as a pause but­ton. Once we re­sume, eco­nomic life will re­turn to nor­mal, and GDP will quickly bounce back to prepan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>The most pes­simistic form of re­cov­ery will be the anaemic Lshaped one.</p>
    <p>This posits that the pandemic will yield per­ma­nent ef­fects on the eco­nomic ca­pac­ity of the coun­try. The loss in in­vest­ment, em­ploy­ment and out­put will cause a per­ma­nent change in global eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>Some­where in be­tween these two ex­tremes are the W-shaped and Kshaped re­cov­er­ies. The W-shaped re­cov­ery de­scribes a volatile path to­wards eco­nomic re­cov­ery, whereas the K-shaped re­cov­ery lays out dif­fer­ent out­comes de­pend­ing on the na­ture of the sec­tors.</p>
    <p>A W-shaped re­cov­ery hap­pens when we have in­ef­fec­tive con­tain­ment poli­cies that lead to a resur­gence of Covid-19 cases after a gen­eral re­sump­tion of ac­tiv­i­ties, cre­at­ing par­tial re­cov­er­ies and sub­se­quent down­turns.</p>
    <p>KEY FAC­TORS THAT DE­TER­MINE SHAPE OF THE RE­COV­ERY</p>
    <p>It is hard to pre­dict when the coro­n­avirus pandemic will end.</p>
    <p>Even if the sit­u­a­tion is con­tained in our lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties, much of the re­cov­ery in Sin­ga­pore will de­pend cru­cially on the suc­cess of con­tain­ment ef­forts in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The de­mand for ex­ports and the re­vival in tourism-re­lated sec­tors will re­quire a healthy global pop­u­la­tion and global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>To en­sure a speedy re­cov­ery, con­sump­tion needs to pick up, and for that, house­holds need to feel safe.</p>
    <p>The sense of se­cu­rity will trans­late to con­sumer spend­ing once the econ­omy opens up fully.</p>
    <p>When a fam­ily mem­ber loses his or her job, the fam­ily may fall be­hind in their credit card pay­ments and mort­gages, re­duc­ing the house­hold’s abil­ity to spend.</p>
    <p>Even for house­holds whose mem­bers are lucky to re­main em­ployed, greater un­cer­tainty about the fu­ture alone can in­duce a re­duc­tion in con­sump­tion as fam­i­lies in­crease pre­cau­tion­ary sav­ings.</p>
    <p>Hence, con­sumer spend­ing will be the ul­ti­mate lit­mus test of whether we are headed on the road to­wards a speedy re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Pre­vent­ing a cas­cade of business bank­rupt­cies will be an­other im­por­tant front to tackle if we want to en­sure a speedy re­cov­ery. It takes time to build busi­nesses and in­vest­ments are fun­da­men­tal in de­ter­min­ing long-term eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>As long as we can pre­vent sys­temic bank­rupt­cies when the econ­omy fully opens up, in­vest­ments will in­crease in tan­dem, boost­ing eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, guar­an­tee­ing that the labour mar­ket has enough flex­i­bil­ity to re­al­lo­cate work­ers in the post-Covid-19 econ­omy will be es­sen­tial.</p>
    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment and re­trench­ment are painful ex­pe­ri­ences for work­ers, not only be­cause they suf­fer a loss in in­come, but also be­cause these have long-term scar­ring ef­fects if they are not able to find new em­ploy­ment quickly.</p>
    <p>Pro­longed pe­ri­ods of un­em­ploy­ment tend to gen­er­ate loss in hu­man cap­i­tal and skills.</p>
    <p>For that rea­son, the eco­nomic dam­age of the cur­rent pandemic can leave a scar­ring ef­fect that can be trans­lated into long-term un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>That said, trainee­ships for re­cent grad­u­ates and train­ing pro­grammes for re­trenched work­ers will mit­i­gate the long-term dam­age of the cur­rent pandemic.</p>
    <p>The road ahead of us will be un­cer­tain, but re­cent data in the labour mar­ket pro­vides some hope for a speedy re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>The mix of re­trench­ment – that is, the ter­mi­na­tion of per­ma­nent or term con­tract em­ploy­ees – and tem­po­rary layoffs in the cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment is very dif­fer­ent from past re­ces­sions.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore’s pre­vi­ous re­ces­sions, sim­i­lar to the pe­riod fol­low­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, we ob­served a his­tor­i­cal spike in re­trench­ment.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, in the cur­rent re­ces­sion, com­pa­nies are adopt­ing tem­po­rary cost-sav­ing mea­sures, plac­ing em­ploy­ees on shorter work weeks or en­forc­ing tem­po­rary layoffs in­stead of per­ma­nently lay­ing off staff.</p>
    <p>This dif­fer­ence is im­por­tant, and it bodes well for a speedy re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Once eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties pick up, staff who were tem­po­rar­ily laid off can quickly re­sume work, avoid­ing a pro­longed spell of un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Even for house­holds whose mem­bers are lucky to re­main em­ployed, greater un­cer­tainty about the fu­ture alone can in­duce a re­duc­tion in con­sump­tion as fam­i­lies in­crease pre­cau­tion­ary sav­ings. Hence, con­sumer spend­ing will be the ul­ti­mate lit­mus test of whether we are headed on the road to­wards a speedy re­cov­ery.</p>
