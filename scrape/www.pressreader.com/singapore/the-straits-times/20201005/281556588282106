    <p>The Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) last Satur­day is­sued a state­ment re­fut­ing sev­eral fresh al­le­ga­tions lev­elled against it by Malaysian rights group Lawyers for Lib­erty (LFL). MHA was re­spond­ing to a state­ment posted on LFL’s web­site last Fri­day in which the non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion made sev­eral al­le­ga­tions against the min­istry.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Home Af­fairs (MHA) on Satur­day is­sued a state­ment re­fut­ing sev­eral fresh al­le­ga­tions lev­elled against it by Malaysian rights group Lawyers for Lib­erty (LFL).</p>
    <p>MHA was re­spond­ing to a state­ment posted on LFL’s web­site on Fri­day, in which the non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion (NGO) made sev­eral al­le­ga­tions against the min­istry.</p>
    <p>In the state­ment is­sued by its ad­viser N. Suren­dran, LFL claimed that its civil suit against Sin­ga­pore’s Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam had not been “struck out” by the Malaysian High Court, but had “sim­ply ex­pired” on Sept 21.</p>
    <p>It also claimed that the Malaysian High Court had al­lowed it to re-file the civil suit, which showed that its law­suit was “far from be­ing base­less”.</p>
    <p>LFL had tried to take Mr Shan­mugam to court ear­lier this year af­ter it was is­sued with a Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act (Pofma) di­rec­tion to cor­rect claims on its web­site re­gard­ing Sin­ga­pore’s ju­di­cial ex­e­cu­tion pro­cesses in Changi Prison.</p>
    <p>On the first two points raised by LFL, MHA re­sponded in a state­ment to The Straits Times on Satur­day, stat­ing that it was un­true that LFL’s civil suit had ex­pired.</p>
    <p>Rather, the Malaysian High Court had struck out LFL’s le­gal ac­tion, which was filed in Jan­uary through an orig­i­nat­ing sum­mons, MHA said. This orig­i­nat­ing sum­mons was valid for six months – mean­ing that LFL’s le­gal ac­tion had ex­pired in July.</p>
    <p>LFL had ap­plied to re­new the orig­i­nat­ing sum­mons. But for rea­sons it had not dis­closed, the min­istry added, the or­gan­i­sa­tion with­drew its re­newal ap­pli­ca­tion on Sept 21, lead­ing to the Malaysian High Court strik­ing out the case.</p>
    <p>On the NGO’s claims that its le­gal ac­tion had ba­sis, MHA said this was “mis­lead­ing”, as the law­suit had not even been served on Mr Shan­mugam, nor had it been con­sid­ered on its mer­its.</p>
    <p>“It is disin­gen­u­ous for LFL to sug­gest that the Malaysian High Court had ex­pressed a view as to the mer­its of its suit sim­ply by giv­ing LFL lib­erty to re-file its orig­i­nat­ing sum­mons,” it added.</p>
    <p>LFL in its state­ment on Fri­day made fur­ther al­le­ga­tions against MHA, claim­ing that the min­istry had “dis­hon­estly” failed to men­tion that the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers had “re­fused to ac­cept ser­vice” of court pa­pers on Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>MHA re­futed this, say­ing that proper pro­ce­dures had not been fol­lowed in the process of serv­ing the court pa­pers.</p>
    <p>LFL’s solic­i­tors had in Jan­uary asked if the min­is­ter had le­gal rep­re­sen­ta­tion in Malaysia to ac­cept ser­vice of the court pa­pers on his be­half. Sin­ga­pore’s At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers replied on Feb 13, stat­ing that no one has been or is au­tho­rised in Malaysia to ac­cept ser­vice of process on be­half of the min­is­ter or the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The cor­rect process would have been for LFL to ob­tain leave from the Malaysian High Court to serve its court pa­pers on the min­is­ter in Sin­ga­pore, which it did not fol­low, said MHA.</p>
    <p>“LFL’s flip-flop­ping on the mat­ter demon­strates its cav­a­lier at­ti­tude to­wards these pro­ceed­ings,” it added.</p>
    <p>Separately, LFL also al­leged on Fri­day that Sin­ga­pore has tried to “bury” the truth about “bru­tal ex­e­cu­tion meth­ods” in Changi Prison. In re­sponse, the MHA state­ment rub­bished these claims as “un­true, base­less and pre­pos­ter­ous”.</p>
    <p>“If LFL had any ev­i­dence of such un­law­ful meth­ods, they would have pro­duced it by now, in­stead of re­peat­edly claim­ing that they are un­able to do so un­less granted im­mu­nity by the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment,” said MHA.</p>
    <p>“If LFL is in­deed privy to ‘the real truth’ about al­legedly un­law­ful ex­e­cu­tion meth­ods in Changi Prison, it is in­cum­bent upon them to dis­close it. Un­til such time, and on ac­count of LFL’s per­sis­tent fail­ure or re­fusal to sub­stan­ti­ate its spu­ri­ous claims, its claims re­main base­less.”</p>
    <p>LFL had made sim­i­lar claims in an ar­ti­cle on its web­site on Jan 16 that Sin­ga­pore prison of­fi­cers were in­structed to kick the back of a pris­oner’s neck with great force to break it, if the rope breaks dur­ing a hang­ing.</p>
    <p>A Pofma di­rec­tion was is­sued on Jan 22, which re­quired the NGO to in­sert a correction no­tice on top of the ar­ti­cle. It was in re­sponse to that Pofma di­rec­tion that LFL filed the law­suit in the Malaysian High Court against Mr Shan­mugam on Jan 24.</p>
