    <p>A for­eign do­mes­tic worker was charged and found guilty of theft in Sin­ga­pore and the com­plainant was a wealthy, pow­er­ful per­son, but the maid was later ac­quit­ted by the High Court on ap­peal.</p>
    <p>This shows that ev­ery­one is equal be­fore the law and it does not mat­ter who the per­son is, said Home Af­fairs and Law Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam as he gave a de­tailed ac­count of the se­ries of events in Ms Parti Liyani’s case, which sparked de­bate about the fair­ness of the jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day, he said the case il­lus­trates how the rule of law func­tions in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“We may agree or dis­agree with the State Court’s or High Court’s de­ci­sions and con­clu­sions. But that is a dif­fer­ent mat­ter,” he added. “This case shows that the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem as a whole works.”</p>
    <p>He was mak­ing a min­is­te­rial state­ment on the case in­volv­ing Ms Parti, whom the High Court on Sept 4 ac­quit­ted of theft from then Changi Air­port Group chair­man Liew Mun Leong and his fam­ily. The case sparked an up­roar, with MPs and oth­ers rais­ing ques­tions about the crim­i­nal jus­tice sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said there is a sense in many so­ci­eties that the elite have bent the rules to their ad­van­tage and were “buy­ing off, sub­orn­ing those in gov­ern­ment”.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are fed up with un­fair struc­tures. Equal op­por­tu­ni­ties are dry­ing up,” he added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this is not the case in Sin­ga­pore, he said, adding that it is all the more crit­i­cal to pro­tect the in­tegrity of the sys­tem that has been built up over the years.</p>
    <p>“We must jeal­ously guard the avail­abil­ity of equal op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>UP­HOLD SIN­GA­PORE’S IDEALS</p>
    <p>We must en­sure that ev­ery­one has a fair shake. We must be alert, guard against the wealthy and the pow­er­ful tak­ing un­fair ad­van­tages,” he said. “If Liew Mun Leong did un­fairly in­flu­ence the pro­ceed­ings, then it will be a hit to our foun­da­tions. It will hit our sense of fair­ness, equal­ity, jus­tice. A dent to Project Sin­ga­pore it­self be­cause Sin­ga­pore is built on these ideals.”</p>
    <p>The coun­try has al­ways guarded against the cor­ro­sion of its jus­tice sys­tem, but this does not mean that there will be no abuse of power or cor­rup­tion, said the min­is­ter. When it hap­pens, there must be swift, de­ci­sive ac­tions to pun­ish those re­spon­si­ble and stamp out such be­hav­iour, and suc­ces­sive gov­ern­ments have been very clear about this po­si­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>He cited the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of Teh Cheang Wan, who was min­is­ter for na­tional developmen­t be­tween 1979 and 1986, for cor­rup­tion as a prime ex­am­ple of the Gov­ern­ment’s “ruth­less in­ten­sity in up­hold­ing in­tegrity”.</p>
    <p>He was one of the most se­nior mem­bers of first prime min­is­ter Lee Kuan Yew’s Cab­i­net, yet when cor­rup­tion al­le­ga­tions sur­faced, Mr Lee di­rected the Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bu­reau to in­ves­ti­gate, said Mr Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>“Mr Lee said at that time: ‘There is no way a min­is­ter can avoid investigat­ions, and a trial if there is ev­i­dence to sup­port one.’”</p>
    <p>These val­ues of Sin­ga­pore’s found­ing gen­er­a­tion of lead­ers have been scrupu­lously stressed and ad­hered to by the two suc­ceed­ing prime min­is­ters, and are like “re­li­gious commandmen­ts”, he added.</p>
    <p>“There can­not be any com­pro­mise.”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam noted that un­der Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, many high-rank­ing of­fi­cials who have erred have had ac­tion taken against them.</p>
    <p>He cited sev­eral ex­am­ples: For­mer Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force com­mis­sioner Peter Lim was jailed for six months in 2012 and dis­missed from the public ser­vice for cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>For­mer CPIB as­sis­tant di­rec­tor Ed­win Yeo was jailed for 10 years for crim­i­nal breach of trust as a public ser­vant and forgery.</p>
    <p>For­mer Na­tional Kid­ney Foun­da­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive T. T. Du­rai was jailed for three months for cor­rup­tion.</p>
    <p>For­mer Sin­ga­pore En­vi­ron­ment Coun­cil ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Howard Shaw was jailed for 12 weeks for paid sex with a mi­nor.</p>
    <p>Said the min­is­ter: “The mes­sage is: It doesn’t mat­ter who you are. If you do wrong, ac­tion will be taken.”</p>
    <p>We must jeal­ously guard the avail­abil­ity of equal op­por­tu­ni­ties. We must en­sure that ev­ery­one has a fair shake. We must be alert, guard against the wealthy and the pow­er­ful tak­ing un­fair ad­van­tages.</p>
    <p>If Liew Mun Leong did un­fairly in­flu­ence the pro­ceed­ings, then it will be a hit to our foun­da­tions. It will hit our sense of fair­ness, equal­ity, jus­tice. A dent to Project Sin­ga­pore it­self be­cause Sin­ga­pore is built on these ideals.</p>
