    <p>•</p>
    <p>French cou­turier Pierre Cardin, who made his name by sell­ing de­signer clothes to the masses, and his for­tune by be­ing the first to ex­ploit that name as a brand for sell­ing ev­ery­thing from cars to per­fume, died yes­ter­day aged 98.</p>
    <p>In a ca­reer span­ning more than 60 years, Mr Cardin drew scorn and ad­mi­ra­tion from fel­low fash­ion de­sign­ers for his brash busi­ness sense. He main­tained that he built his busi­ness em­pire with­out ever ask­ing a bank for a loan.</p>
    <p>He was the first de­signer to sell clothes col­lec­tions in de­part­ment stores in the late 1950s, and the first to en­ter the li­cens­ing busi­ness for per­fumes, ac­ces­sories and even food. “It’s all the same to me whether I am do­ing sleeves for dresses or ta­ble legs,” a telling quote on his web­site once read.</p>
    <p>Ar­mani choco­lates, Bulgari ho­tels and Gucci sun­glasses are all based on Mr Cardin’s re­al­i­sa­tion that a fash­ion brand’s glam­our had end­less mer­chan­dis­ing po­ten­tial. Over the years, his name has been stamped on ra­zor blades, house­hold goods, and tacky ac­ces­sories – even cheap boxer shorts.</p>
    <p>His de­trac­tors ac­cused him of de­stroy­ing the value of his brand and the no­tion of lux­ury in gen­eral.</p>
    <p>“I had a sense for mar­ket­ing my name,” Mr Cardin told Ger­many’s Sued­deutsche Zeitung news­pa­per in 2007. “Does money spoil one’s ideas? I don’t dream of money after all, but while I’m dream­ing, I’m mak­ing money.”</p>
    <p>Born near Venice on July 2, 1922, to French par­ents of Ital­ian de­scent, Mr Cardin was ed­u­cated in the French city of Saint Eti­enne.</p>
    <p>He went to work for a tailor in nearby Vichy at age 17 and dreamt for a time of be­com­ing an ac­tor, do­ing some work on the stage as well as mod­el­ling and danc­ing.</p>
    <p>When he went to Paris in 1945, he made the­atri­cal masks and cos­tumes for Jean Cocteau’s film, Beauty And The Beast, and a year later joined the then-un­known de­signer Chris­tian Dior.</p>
    <p>His first big com­mer­cial ven­ture, when he teamed up with the</p>
    <p>Prin­temps de­part­ment store in the 1950s, led to a brief ex­pul­sion from the Cham­bre Syn­di­cale de la Cou­ture. Cou­turi­ers in that ex­clu­sive club were for­bid­den then to show out­side their Paris sa­lons.</p>
    <p>He also pre­sented a col­lec­tion in Com­mu­nist China in 1979, when it was still largely closed to the out­side world. And just two years after the Ber­lin Wall came down, in 1991, a Cardin fash­ion show on Moscow’s Red Square drew a crowd of 200,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Cardin also ex­panded into new busi­nesses, buy­ing the ex­clu­sive Paris restau­rant Maxim’s in the 1980s and open­ing replica out­lets world­wide. He lever­aged the in­vest­ment fur­ther by launch­ing Minim’s, a chain of fancy fast-food joints that re­pro­duced Maxim’s Belle Epoque decor.</p>
    <p>His em­pire em­braces per­fumes, foods, in­dus­trial de­sign, real es­tate, en­ter­tain­ment and even flow­ers. For his lat­est ven­ture, in Fe­bru­ary, he teamed up with a de­signer seven decades his ju­nior.</p>
    <p>Mr Cardin, who was not mar­ried and did not have chil­dren, said he still rated orig­i­nal­ity above any­thing else.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ways tried to be dif­fer­ent, to be my­self,” he said. “Whether peo­ple like it or not, that’s not what mat­ters.”</p>
