    <p>Mo­hamed Al-Matin, 31, Le Matin Patisserie; go to www.lemat­in­patis­serie.com</p>
    <p>On the wall of the pas­try chef’s tiny kitchen in Rae­burn Park is a wooden sign strung over the re­mote con­trol holder for the air­con­di­tioner.</p>
    <p>It says: The Tough Day Was Yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It is a play on a mo­ti­va­tional say­ing from the United States Navy Seals, which is: “The only easy day was yes­ter­day.”</p>
    <p>The chef’s sign can be read in dif­fer­ent ways. Does it hint at the long jour­ney to get to where he is now? That the worst is be­hind him? Or is he an­tic­i­pat­ing – and rel­ish­ing – tougher chal­lenges? Turns out, it is both.</p>
    <p>He says he has a “very sweet tooth”.</p>
    <p>“I al­ways need some­thing sweet after din­ner,” he says.</p>
    <p>When he was younger, he loved the pas­tries from Delifrance and its tuna crois­sant. After na­tional ser­vice – he was in the Guards – he had three op­tions: sign up as a reg­u­lar in the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces be­cause he loved his time in NS, be­come a sports teacher or make pas­try.</p>
    <p>The choice to him was clear and he headed to Le Cor­don Bleu in Sydney for an ad­vanced di­ploma in pas­try, patisserie and culi­nary man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>He jug­gled classes and work, writ­ing to the best patis­series in the city.</p>
    <p>He re­mem­bers the day Black Star Pas­try, fa­mous for its Straw­berry Water­melon Cake; and Zumbo, the em­pire of Aus­tralia’s dessert king Adri­ano Zumbo, both of­fered him jobs. He worked four days a week for Zumbo and the other three for Black Star.</p>
    <p>“I was just push­ing it all the way,” he says about his ea­ger­ness to learn. “I al­ways had two jobs.”</p>
    <p>When fine-din­ing restau­rant</p>
    <p>Quay came a-knock­ing, he went to work there, in ad­di­tion to his hours at Zumbo.</p>
    <p>After get­ting his di­ploma, he de­cided to head to the US and spent two months work­ing at two-Miche­lin-starred Coi in San Fran­cisco. Later, he scored a one-month stage at three-Miche­lin-starred Le Bernardin in New York.</p>
    <p>In 2013, he was riding his bi­cy­cle at 7am to Le Bernardin in the bike lane when a car hit him. “I was told it was a rob­ber who was be­ing chased by the po­lice,” he says.</p>
    <p>Then came the dif­fi­cult road to re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>One month in an in­duced coma, two months bedrid­den in hospi­tal, two more months in a rented New York apart­ment. Metal in his arms and legs. A right hand that did not work.</p>
    <p>His army and sec­ondary school friends raised funds to pay his med­i­cal bills; he es­ti­mates the Amer­i­can bill alone was US$250,000.</p>
    <p>He came back to have surgery on the right hand at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hospi­tal and won­dered what was next for him.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the ac­ci­dent, he had a job wait­ing for him at Restau­rant An­dre, chef An­dre Chi­ang’s now-de­funct restau­rant in Bukit Pa­soh. The chef en­cour­aged him to cook with his brain, and when he could, he joined the brigade there.</p>
    <p>When the restau­rant closed in 2018, he headed to Copenhagen to work at Noma, the most fa­mous restau­rant in the world. He worked there through two cy­cles of Noma’s three sea­sons: Seafood, Veg­eta­bles, and Game and For­est.</p>
    <p>He had al­ways given him­self a dead­line – to have his own business by the time he was 33. He beat his dead­line by two years, re­turn­ing to Sin­ga­pore ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>After sell­ing pas­tries at pop-ups and col­lab­o­ra­tions, he started turn­ing out those boxes in cafe kitchens that were not maxed out be­cause of the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>When that lifted, he found space in Rae­burn Park, off Spot­tis­woode Park, in a clus­ter of low-rise build­ings hous­ing in­dus­trial-type busi­nesses in a tran­quil set­ting.</p>
    <p>There, to­gether with two staff, a part-timer and a dish­washer, he puts in long hours, usu­ally from 4am to 2pm or 7am to 5pm.</p>
    <p>But The Tough Day Was Yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion is keen in Sin­ga­pore – the food business is not for the faint of heart.</p>
    <p>There are oth­ers nip­ping at his heels. So­cial me­dia can be bru­tal and his de­trac­tors are as vo­cif­er­ous as his ad­mir­ers.</p>
    <p>But it does not hurt to dream. He is eye­ing a big­ger space in Rae­burn Park, with space for din­ing-in. When he can, his of­fer­ings will in­clude much more than pas­tries. There will be cakes, sausage rolls and pies.</p>
    <p>He and his in­vestors – three army bud­dies – hope to open the shop at the start of next year.</p>
    <p>His favourite pas­try is an al­mond crois­sant and he goes to Mother Dough in North Bridge Road for it.</p>
    <p>Why doesn’t he make his own? “I’ll have pain au choco­lat and al­mond crois­sant,” he says.</p>
    <p>“But the shapes need to be unique and ex­clu­sive. It’s in the works.”</p>
