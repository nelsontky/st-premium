    <p>De­spite cur­rent ap­pear­ances, it pays to look closer at the as­sump­tions un­der­ly­ing the wide­spread views about the un­rav­el­ling of the United States and the rise of China, says Pro­fes­sor Joseph Chiny­ong Liow.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica, the coun­try that ev­ery­one ap­par­ently loves to hate, is con­vuls­ing yet again: This time, over that in­tractable prob­lem of racism. For its de­trac­tors, the lat­est dis­cord and civil un­rest are yet fur­ther ev­i­dence of a de­cline that is as pal­pa­ble as it is ir­re­versible. For the rest of us, we must by now have surely grown ac­cus­tomed to talk about the United States be­ing un­teth­ered and adrift, dis­play­ing nei­ther the abil­ity nor de­sire to play a lead­ing role in global af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Two as­sump­tions lie be­hind these sen­ti­ments. First, the re­sources that the US has at its dis­posal to play this global lead­er­ship role have di­min­ished con­sid­er­ably. This is es­pe­cially so if we com­pare it with the rise of China, which is in­vari­ably what ev­ery­one is do­ing. Sec­ond, Amer­i­cans no longer de­sire their coun­try to play such a role.</p>
    <p>Be­fore we join the cho­rus to bid adieu to Amer­i­can lead­er­ship, it is ap­pro­pri­ate to first ex­am­ine these as­sump­tions and ask if de­cline is in­evitable and ir­repara­ble or, per­haps, as Win­ston Churchill fa­mously mused: “Amer­i­cans will al­ways do the right thing, only af­ter they have tried ev­ery­thing else.”</p>
    <p>DE­CLIN­ING POWER OR DE­CLIN­ING IN­FLU­ENCE?</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s per­sona as a leader in global af­fairs is pred­i­cated on its role as the chief ar­chi­tect of the rules-based in­ter­na­tional or­der that emerged from the ashes of World War II. Work­ing closely with friends and al­lies, the US built the net­work of mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions and frame­work of norms and rules that has gov­erned in­ter­na­tional af­fairs for the last 70 years, and that has been re­spon­si­ble for the glob­al­i­sa­tion and pros­per­ity that many – ad­mit­tedly, not all – have en­joyed dur­ing this time.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially, this or­der was un­der­girded by Amer­i­can mil­i­tary power and eco­nomic might. In­deed, it was this com­bi­na­tion of power, purse, and pur­pose, en­hanced by soft power, that made Amer­ica the most for­mi­da­ble ac­tor on the in­ter­na­tional stage as it out­lasted pre­sump­tive chal­lengers. In the global soft power arena, it is hard to beat the ap­peal of Michael Jor­dan and the Na­tional Bas­ket­ball</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­a­tion or the self-re­new­ing ros­ter of A-list stars that emerge from Hol­ly­wood and, in­creas­ingly, Net­flix.</p>
    <p>Not­with­stand­ing the scourge of Covid-19 or the ar­gu­ments of naysay­ers, Amer­ica re­mains the most pow­er­ful coun­try in the world to­day by a con­sid­er­able mea­sure.</p>
    <p>By way of il­lus­tra­tion, it was re­ported a few weeks ago that the US Navy had three car­rier groups ply­ing Asian wa­ters at the same time. How many navies in the world are able to do that? This is all the more re­mark­able given that four air­craft car­ri­ers were crip­pled by Covid-19 barely a few weeks ear­lier. Much is made of Amer­ica’s eco­nomic de­cline, yet more than 70 per cent of the global econ­omy still op­er­ates on the green­back, and it re­mains the pre­ferred safe-haven as­set for pri­vate in­vestors and gov­ern­ments alike, in­clud­ing China.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing of China, it may have sur­passed the US in pur­chas­ing power par­ity, but this is an im­pre­cise mea­sure of how eco­nomic size trans­lates to geopo­lit­i­cal in­flu­ence.</p>
    <p>Closer to home, the US$200 bil­lion (S$279 bil­lion) that the US has in­vested in Asean (ac­cord­ing to an East-West Cen­tre re­port last year) dwarfs the US$50 bil­lion China has ploughed into the re­gion over the same pe­riod. Con­sider too, how Amer­i­can in­sti­tu­tions of higher learn­ing and cul­ture of in­no­va­tion and in­ven­tive­ness re­main unmatched.</p>
    <p>All this is not to take any­thing away from China and the great strides it has made in clos­ing the eco­nomic and tech­no­log­i­cal gap with the US. But it is a pretty size­able gap.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, just as it would be fool­hardy to think that rel­a­tive de­cline of Amer­i­can power is a fore­gone con­clu­sion: So too, the con­tin­u­a­tion of Chi­nese eco­nomic growth at break­neck speed should not be con­sid­ered a rac­ing cer­tainty. In­deed, these are things that strate­gic thinkers in Zhong­nan­hai are acutely aware of.</p>
    <p>This is not to say that all is well with Amer­ica, be­cause it is surely not. In­deed, there is a need to dis­tin­guish be­tween Amer­i­can power and Amer­i­can in­flu­ence, to wit: While Amer­i­can power re­mains un­ri­valled, its abil­ity to trans­late it into in­flu­ence has been wan­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Ge­orge Ken­nan, the ar­chi­tect of Amer­ica’s Cold War con­tain­ment pol­icy, once said: “It is pri­mar­ily by ex­am­ple, never by pre­cept, that a coun­try such as ours ex­erts its most use­ful in­flu­ence be­yond its bor­ders.” It is not nec­es­sary to re­hearse the de­tails of all the ills that be­devil the US to­day. Suf­fice to say, the “City on a Hill”, to bor­row for­mer pres­i­dent Ron­ald Rea­gan’s metaphor, is be­set by land­slides, many of its own do­ing. The harsh re­al­ity is that Amer­i­can so­ci­ety and pol­i­tics have be­come deeply po­larised, blighted by all man­ner of do­mes­tic prob­lems.</p>
    <p>These prob­lems did not orig­i­nate with the Trump pres­i­dency, but it has cer­tainly brought them into sharper fo­cus. Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s dismantlin­g of the global or­der that his pre­de­ces­sors helped to cre­ate and up­hold has been costly. Add to this the grow­ing list of con­tro­ver­sial dis­missals and res­ig­na­tions of ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials, and we have a bleak pic­ture of deep dys­func­tion­al­ity within the White House. Just as Mr Ken­nan pre­dicted, this has taken a toll on Amer­i­can in­flu­ence abroad.</p>
    <p>WHAT OF PUBLIC OPIN­ION?</p>
    <p>Though ge­og­ra­phy may not al­ways be des­tiny, it has none­the­less af­forded Amer­ica great strate­gic ad­van­tages. The US is blessed with oceans and al­lies along its bor­ders. Con­sid­er­ing that it is also vir­tu­ally en­ergy self-suf­fi­cient to­day, the ap­peal of iso­la­tion­ism becomes per­haps more com­pre­hen­si­ble.</p>
    <p>In fact, iso­la­tion­ism is not new to Amer­ica. It has been deeply em­bed­ded in the psy­che of a seg­ment of its pop­u­la­tion for some time, pe­ri­od­i­cally surfacing at crit­i­cal junc­tures of his­tory. Con­sider the pop­ulism of the 1880s and the thrice non-rat­i­fi­ca­tion of the League of Na­tions in 1919-1920, or the (first it­er­a­tion of) “Amer­ica First” of the 1930s and the na­tivism of the 1970s.</p>
    <p>But how preva­lent are such sen­ti­ments to­day?</p>
    <p>In 2017, the Chicago Coun­cil on Global Af­fairs sur­veyed Amer­i­cans on the ques­tion: Do you think it will be best for the fu­ture of the coun­try if we take an ac­tive part in world af­fairs or if we stay out of world af­fairs? 63 per cent af­firmed the for­mer.</p>
    <p>A 2018 sur­vey by the Eura­sia Group Foun­da­tion asked whether the US should in­ter­vene mil­i­tar­ily abroad in the event of hu­man­i­tar­ian abuses – 43 per cent cau­tioned re­straint while 34 per cent thought that in­volve­ment should be pur­sued only as part of a United Na­tions-led ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a ques­tion, in the same sur­vey, on how peace for the US could be best at­tained, 52 per cent ex­pressed the view that peace is best guar­an­teed through fo­cus­ing on do­mes­tic needs, avoid­ing un­nec­es­sary in­ter­ven­tions abroad, and de­ploy­ing mil­i­tary power only when vi­tal in­ter­ests are threat­ened, while 48 per cent be­lieved peace was best guar­an­teed through es­tab­lish­ing and re­in­forc­ing global eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion and pro­mot­ing democ­racy world­wide.</p>
    <p>In other words, Amer­i­cans may be in­ward-look­ing, but they do not ap­pear over­whelm­ingly so.</p>
    <p>Last De­cem­ber, a Pew Re­search Cen­tre sur­vey on for­eign pol­icy re­vealed that 73 per cent of Amer­i­cans polled be­lieved good diplo­macy was the best way to en­sure peace for the US, while 68 per cent be­lieved their lead­ers should take into ac­count the in­ter­ests of al­lies in for­eign pol­icy de­ci­sions rather than re­ly­ing solely on na­tional in­ter­est cal­cu­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing to global public opin­ion, a Jan­uary poll by Pew sur­vey­ing 33 coun­tries found that the US is viewed more favourably than China in 26 of them. Of the 33 coun­tries, five were Asian (Ja­pan, South Korea, In­dia, the Philip­pines and In­done­sia), and all of them viewed the US more pos­i­tively com­pared with China by be­tween six (In­done­sia) and 54 (Ja­pan) per­cent­age points. At the same time, the pop­u­lar­ity of the US pres­i­dent has plum­meted, from 74 per cent dur­ing Mr Barack Obama’s fi­nal year in of­fice to 31 per cent for Mr Trump at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>WHAT DO THESE</p>
    <p>DATA POINTS TELL US?</p>
    <p>Two things are ev­i­dent as far as US public opin­ion is con­cerned. First, while it is true that a not in­signif­i­cant num­ber of Amer­i­cans may pre­fer a more re­strained for­eign pol­icy, the gulf be­tween them and those favour­ing more ac­tive in­volve­ment in the world may not be as big as we pre­sume.</p>
    <p>Sure, Mr Trump was elected on an “Amer­ica First” plat­form, but lest we for­get, he did lose the pop­u­lar vote. It stands to rea­son then, that while Amer­i­cans may not pri­ori­tise for­eign pol­icy when they vote, this does not nec­es­sar­ily mean that they do not care about events across the world, or that they do not think the US has a role to play in shap­ing those events.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the sur­vey re­sults also sug­gest that Amer­i­cans ap­pear to have a more so­phis­ti­cated ap­pre­ci­a­tion of the roles that for­eign pol­icy and diplo­macy play in the pur­suit of US na­tional in­ter­ests than we are of­ten given to be­lieve. Case in point: Amer­i­cans op­pose mil­i­tary in­ter­ven­tions as an in­stru­ment of for­eign pol­icy, but they ap­pre­ci­ate the value of diplo­macy, lead­er­ship, and par­tic­i­pa­tion in eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>As for global public opin­ion, it is clear that while many may cringe at Amer­ica’s preach­ing of democrati­sa­tion and hu­man rights or howl in protest at mis­guided mil­i­tary in­ter­ven­tions across the world, there re­mains a reser­voir of good­will that wel­comes, en­dorses and de­sires the con­tin­ued in­volve­ment of the US in in­ter­na­tional af­fairs in some form.</p>
    <p>Of course, sur­veys are not fool­proof, and the data can surely be parsed fur­ther. But they do hint at pos­si­ble pat­terns, one of which is that, for the most part, Amer­i­cans still con­sider for­eign pol­icy ac­tivism nec­es­sary to the ad­vance­ment of na­tional in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>And fi­nally, by way of sub­text: As pow­er­ful as an Amer­i­can pres­i­dent might be, he is not syn­ony­mous with Amer­ica. Ergo, the per­sonal flaws of a pres­i­dent should not be pro­jected upon the na­tion.</p>
    <p>In­deed, as detri­men­tal as the cur­rent Pres­i­dent’s mis­cal­cu­la­tions and mis­judg­ments on for­eign af­fairs have been, they do not re­flect the deep reser­voir of think­ing on Amer­ica’s role and place in the world that ex­ists in the US, but that has gone un­tapped by the cur­rent oc­cu­pants of the West Wing.</p>
    <p>By most mea­sures, the US is still the fore­most power in the world, and will in all like­li­hood re­main so for the fore­see­able fu­ture. Be­cause of this, it re­mains in a strong po­si­tion to shape global af­fairs, not­with­stand­ing prophe­cies of its demise, pres­sures of grow­ing great power com­pe­ti­tion, or vi­cis­si­tudes of a chief ex­ec­u­tive who is sin­gu­larly un­in­ter­ested in state­craft.</p>
    <p>Amer­ica’s chal­lenge is to trans­late its con­sid­er­able power into con­se­quen­tial in­flu­ence on the ba­sis that its in­ter­ests are best served not by ab­ro­gat­ing lead­er­ship of the global or­der, but by work­ing with friends, part­ners, and even other great pow­ers, to re­design the role such that it is fit for pur­pose to deal with a whole range of new and com­plex chal­lenges con­fronting hu­man­ity.</p>
    <p>And if the data we have seen is any­thing to go by, Amer­i­cans are, for the most part, com­fort­able with this; and the world, for the most part, wel­comes and sup­ports it.</p>
