    <p>LON­DON Just a few short weeks ago, Jose Mour­inho’s Tot­ten­ham were top of the Premier League and look­ing ev­ery inch cred­i­ble ti­tle chal­lengers.</p>
    <p>Now they are seven points off the pace af­ter two draws and two de­feats in their past four matches – and had to face the fur­ther frus­tra­tion this week of a coro­n­avirusen­forced post­pone­ment.</p>
    <p>The un­happy Spurs man­ager had said his side should be do­ing more to kill off games af­ter con­ced­ing late in a dis­ap­point­ing 1-1 draw at Wolves on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>His mood was not helped by the can­cel­la­tion of the home match against Ful­ham on Wed­nes­day with three hours’ no­tice af­ter a Covid-19 out­break in the vis­i­tors’ camp. That was the se­cond post­pone­ment this week af­ter Manch­ester City’s game at Ever­ton.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing ahead of to­day’s home clash against Leeds United, Mour­inho was clearly still up­set by the de­ci­sion. But apart from the things he has no con­trol over, the Por­tuguese is con­fi­dent that he can turn his side’s for­tunes around.</p>
    <p>He said: “Foot­ball is also men­tal. I be­lieve we’re gong to have again a good pe­riod, where we win matches and score goals.</p>
    <p>“If you look at the clubs, apart from As­ton Villa, who al­ways kept that sta­bil­ity, one was knocked out of the Cham­pi­ons League (Manch­ester United), another one drew two matches in a row (Liver­pool), and another one lost three matches away from home (Chelsea).”</p>
    <p>When asked about the post­pone­ment of the Ful­ham game, Mour­inho said it felt “un­pro­fes­sional”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Train­ing ses­sions be­fore that would be dif­fer­ent if we were go­ing to play that game. Peo­ple say good for me that there was no game, but only good for me if I knew there was no game.”</p>
    <p>Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds are just three points be­hind Spurs (26) af­ter bounc­ing back from their 6-2 thrash­ing by Manch­ester United with wins over Burn­ley (1-0) and West Brom (5-0).</p>
    <p>To­day’s fix­ture is a clash of styles – Bielsa al­ways urges his play­ers to play in a quick and fear­less at­tack­ing man­ner while Mour­inho’s teams are known for sit­ting back and hit­ting on the counter.</p>
    <p>Leeds have scored the most goals (30) among teams in the bot­tom half, and de­fen­sive-minded Spurs have con­ceded only 15 goals, which are fewer than all the top four sides be­fore yes­ter­day’s round of matches.</p>
    <p>But Mour­inho brushed off any com­par­isons. “Ev­ery­body knows the team they are, ev­ery­body knows the way they like to play and that’s it,” he said.</p>
    <p>Gareth Bale and Gio­vani lo Celso are in­jured, while Lu­cas Moura and Car­los Vini­cius are ex­pected to be in­volved af­ter both missed the trip to Wolves.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho is also not ex­pect­ing Tot­ten­ham to do much busi­ness in this month’s trans­fer win­dow, adding that it would be a “big sur­prise” if the club make a sign­ing.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing ended 2020 on a high, Bielsa is brac­ing him­self for a “very dif­fi­cult” bat­tle to­day.</p>
    <p>“In ev­ery po­si­tion they have solid, good play­ers and they have op­tions,” said the for­mer Ath­letic Bil­bao boss, who had lost all four meet­ings against Mour­inho’s Real Madrid side from 2011 to 2013.</p>
    <p>Diego Llorente, Liam Cooper, Robin Koch are all out in­jured for Leeds, while Ma­teusz Klich re­mains a doubt af­ter pick­ing up a thigh prob­lem against West Brom.</p>
