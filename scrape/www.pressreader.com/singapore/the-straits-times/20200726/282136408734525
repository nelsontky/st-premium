    <p>Five-year-old Eden Teo al­ways looks for­ward to his lessons at Happy Fish Swim School, where he has been learn­ing to swim for more than two years.</p>
    <p>When that abruptly stopped dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, his mother Michelle Low, 33, found it tough to man­age as there were fewer out­lets for him to ex­pend his en­ergy.</p>
    <p>“He missed the swim­ming lessons very much,” says Ms Low, who works in the so­cial ser­vice sec­tor. She is grate­ful that the school kept in touch and sent her videos so that Eden could prac­tise drills and breath­ing tech­niques at home.</p>
    <p>His lessons re­sumed on June 25, but it was nowhere near nor­mal – his class size was re­duced from six to four, and there were tem­per­a­ture checks and safety mea­sures as well as lane ropes sep­a­rat­ing the stu­dents.</p>
    <p>The kids were not al­lowed to use the play pool to warm up be­fore­hand and par­ents had to re­main out­side.</p>
    <p>Still, Ms Low says Eden was “very de­lighted” to be able to swim again and meet his friends. She also feels it is safer for him to swim in the cen­tre’s pri­vate pool, with its pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures, than in a pub­lic one.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Jian Yong, Happy Fish’s man­ag­ing di­rec­tor, says about 80 per cent of its 3,000 stu­dents want to re­turn, but it can ac­com­mo­date only about 60 per cent be­cause of re­duced ca­pac­ity guide­lines.</p>
    <p>He is heart­ened that “de­mand is still strong” and that par­ents took a lik­ing to the school’s Face­book livestream videos dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, where it dis­pensed tips on sim­ple swim­ming move­ments, and more, to do at home.</p>
    <p>Like Mr Tan, other play­ers in the bil­lion-dol­lar en­rich­ment and tu­ition in­dus­try here are find­ing their feet af­ter the pan­demic’s sweep­ing eco­nomic blows.</p>
    <p>Some have fought back with in­no­va­tive re­sponses, in­clud­ing cre­at­ing new prod­ucts, go­ing fully dig­i­tal and bring­ing in new for­eign pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Gov­ern­ment’s House­hold Ex­pen­di­ture Sur­vey 2017/2018, fam­i­lies in Sin­ga­pore spent $1.4 bil­lion on tu­ition; and the num­ber of en­rich­ment and tu­ition cen­tres reg­is­tered with the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion has in­creased from about 700 in 2012 to more than 950, re­ported The Straits Times last year.</p>
    <p>BLENDED LEARN­ING IS IN</p>
    <p>Some cen­tres used the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod’s forced iso­la­tion to re­think how lessons are de­liv­ered.</p>
    <p>“We were con­vinced that on­line lessons re­quire a dif­fer­ent ap­proach to be ef­fec­tive com­pared with live lessons,” says Mr Dave Sim, founder of The Physics Cafe, which has more than 1,000 sec­ondary and In­te­grated Pro­gramme stu­dents at­tend­ing its physics, math­e­mat­ics and chem­istry lessons.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents first watched a dig­i­tal record­ing of the les­son, t hen at­tended an on­line tu­to­rial ses­sion a week later. Dur­ing the in-per­son classes, its tu­tors re­viewed the con­cepts quickly and then used quizzes and test chal­lenges to help stu­dents de­velop prob­lem-solv­ing skills.</p>
    <p>“The pro­gramme has been so suc­cess­ful that many stu­dents now pre­fer to at­tend our on­line lessons rather than on-site classes,” Mr Sim adds.</p>
    <p>In-per­son lessons are recorded and up­loaded on­line, and stu­dents can ac­cess its li­brary of dig­i­tal re­sources for free.</p>
    <p>As a tes­ta­ment to its suc­cess, he re­ports that his cen­tres saw a “huge in­flux” of about 100 stu­dents when it re­opened in phase two, with about seven in 10 new sign-ups opt­ing for on­line lessons.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish Coun­cil Sin­ga­pore, which has some 5,000 stu­dents from pre-school age and above, also re­fined its on­line teach­ing ex­pe­ri­ence of English dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>It re­duced class sizes for a bet­ter teach­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, of­fered recorded guides that are ac­ces­si­ble on de­mand and en­gaged stu­dents and par­ents with free vir­tual ses­sions, in­clud­ing show-and-tell, book clubs and ex­am­i­na­tion tips.</p>
    <p>While par­ents have shown an “over­whelm­ing de­mand” for cen­tre-based lessons in phase two, it is look­ing to build on its blended learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence, says Ms Meik­wei Barker, its di­rec­tor of English lan­guage ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“We’ve seen first-hand how on­line, face-to-face learn­ing and tech­nol­ogy can go a long way to en­cour­age greater en­gage­ment, higher lev­els of in­for­ma­tion re­ten­tion and even spark self-mo­ti­va­tion for learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>Blended learn­ing may well be­come the norm for post-Covid-19 en­rich­ment, says Ms Jamie Tan, founder of Fly­ing Cape, an on­line book­ing plat­form with more than 800 ed­u­ca­tion providers. About seven in 10 of its cen­tres cater to school-go­ing kids.</p>
    <p>It sur­veyed about 100 providers early this month and found that 67 per cent will con­tinue to of­fer both on­line and class­room lessons. Another 13 per cent plan to con­tinue of­fer­ing dig­i­tal-only pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>The blended learn­ing ap­proach also works for The Learn­ing Lab, which of­fers aca­demic pro­grammes for chil­dren from preschool to ju­nior col­lege lev­els and runs 2,000 classes a week.</p>
    <p>Its stu­dents are now split into two groups which al­ter­nate be­tween home-based learn­ing and cen­tre­based classes, says Ms Michelle Chen, its di­rec­tor of plan­ning, en­rol­ment and cus­tomer ser­vice.</p>
    <p>No stu­dent is al­lowed to at­tend only class­room lessons for safety rea­sons, and he or she may also opt for fully on­line classes.</p>
    <p>Adapt­ing to the new nor­mal re­quires “open con­ver­sa­tion and col­lab­o­ra­tion” with par­ents and re­spond­ing to their con­cerns, she adds, which is one rea­son it is of­fer­ing 25 per cent in credit to off­set fees in a bid to help fam­i­lies through the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan of Fly­ing Cape adds that the cir­cuit breaker has made more par­ents aware of novel ways of self­learn­ing, such as us­ing AI (ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence), ma­chine learn­ing and gam­i­fi­ca­tion. These cre­ate an “en­gag­ing and im­mer­sive ex­pe­ri­ence for the chil­dren” and will change the way they learn.</p>
    <p>One com­pany that is rid­ing on this trend is KooBits, an ed­u­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy firm whose math­e­mat­ics e-learn­ing pro­grams are used in more than 40 per cent of pri­mary schools.</p>
    <p>It launched its first con­sumer prod­ucts, Home-Based Learn­ing and Live Tu­tor­ing, at the start of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in April. This “com­plete co­in­ci­dence” re­sulted in “huge de­mand” for its e-learn­ing con­tent and more sub­scribers than orig­i­nally fore­cast, says KooBits’ founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Stan­ley Han.</p>
    <p>The com­pany plans to of­fer a sci­ence-based con­sumer prod­uct later this year.</p>
    <p>“This pan­demic has in some ways forced ev­ery­one to give e-learn­ing a try. Just like any prod­uct, it won’t suit ev­ery­one’s tastes. But at least ev­ery­one has over­come the ini­tial in­er­tia and had some ex­pe­ri­ence with e-learn­ing prod­ucts, which has helped many peo­ple ex­pe­ri­ence the value in ed­u­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy,” he adds.</p>
    <p>As ac­cep­tance of e-learn­ing grows, so do the pos­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Fly­ing Cape’s Ms Tan adds that it has been work­ing with over­seas providers to of­fer on­line en­rich­ment here, in­clud­ing Chi­nese lan­guage and art from China, as well as on­line mu­sic from Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, many of its Sin­ga­pore-based ven­dors are look­ing to ex­pand re­gion­ally and can lev­er­age the por­tal’s ex­pan­sion in China and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>KEEP­ING THE HU­MAN TOUCH</p>
    <p>Non-aca­demic en­rich­ment cen­tres, where the hu­man touch is key, found var­i­ous ways to en­gage their stu­dents when they were closed.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers at Crestar Ed­u­ca­tion Group had to re­act fast to of­fer vir­tual lessons for stu­dents study­ing Chi­nese lan­guage, Chi­nese and English speech and drama, aba­cus, art, vi­o­lin and dance.</p>
    <p>This pro­vided the “con­sis­tency and rou­tines chil­dren thrive on”, says Ms Soh Bee Ling, its gen­eral man­ager and head of the en­rich­ment di­vi­sion. It has more than 4,500 stu­dents lo­cally.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers also held “mean­ing­ful live in­ter­ac­tions” af­ter lessons where stu­dents re­flected on their feel­ings and im­proved their well­be­ing.</p>
    <p>About 80 per cent of stu­dents have re­turned to cen­tre-based lessons in phase two, and it has not had to turn away chil­dren as class sizes have al­ways been kept small.</p>
    <p>Some cen­tres have had to over­haul their en­tire ap­proach, like KindyROO Sin­ga­pore, the lo­cal arm of a child de­vel­op­ment pro­gramme from Aus­tralia that aims to en­hance chil­dren’s learn­ing abil­i­ties through sen­sory-move­ment ac­tiv­i­ties guided by neu­ro­science.</p>
    <p>It has stopped phys­i­cal classes since the mid­dle of this month as it caters to chil­dren as young as six weeks old, says the cen­tre’s di­rec­tor, Ms Shee Hock Ai Ling.</p>
    <p>KindyROO now of­fers on­line classes par­ents can par­tic­i­pate in at home with their lit­tle ones at a frac­tion of the pre­vi­ous rate – $197 for 10 vir­tual classes, com­pared with $660 for 12 cen­tre-based classes.</p>
    <p>It also of­fers one-on-one on­line con­sul­ta­tion ses­sions for par­ents who need per­son­alised ad­vice, as well as cus­tomised well­ness pro­grammes for kids.</p>
    <p>How­ever, some par­ents and chil­dren still pre­fer phys­i­cal classes.</p>
    <p>Mrs Indy Lach­har, 38, a talent de­vel­op­ment di­rec­tor, is glad her son Aryan, seven, re­turned for lessons at Da Lit­tle Arts School in phase two. He has also re­sumed ten­nis lessons and is wait­ing for a va­cancy at his reg­u­lar gym­nas­tics cen­tre.</p>
    <p>She feels it is im­por­tant to con­tinue his in­door and out­door en­rich­ment as they stim­u­late his brain and keep him en­gaged and learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Da Lit­tle Arts School founder Eileen Yeo did not con­duct on­line art lessons dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker as she felt they could not repli­cate the qual­ity of its classes. In­stead, she launched DaBox, a $38 craft box for chil­dren to do art ac­tiv­i­ties and have fun off­screen dur­ing the stay-home pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The re­sponse was so good that the school cre­ated eight themes and sold more than 1,500 boxes in eight weeks.</p>
    <p>Even though cen­tre-based lessons have re­sumed, it is now of­fer­ing a Na­tional Day-themed box as well as DaBox Mini, a smaller ver­sion that is pop­u­lar as goodie bags for re­mote birthday cel­e­bra­tions. The lat­ter was in­spired by a par­ent’s re­quest.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo says the pan­demic has forced her to in­no­vate her 10-yearold busi­ness and “find new ways to add value”. She re­mains up­beat.</p>
    <p>“This cri­sis has pre­sented us the op­por­tu­nity to build spe­cial bonds with our cus­tomers and to even­tu­ally emerge from this stronger than be­fore.”</p>
