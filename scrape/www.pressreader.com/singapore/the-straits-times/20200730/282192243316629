    <p>The ten­der for a new funeral par­lour com­plex in Wood­lands was launched on Tues­day by the Hous­ing Board, as Sin­ga­pore pre­pares for an ex­pected in­crease in res­i­dent deaths in the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>It is the first of four funeral par­lour com­plex sites that the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) will roll out over the next decade to cope with the age­ing pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The 5,002.8 sq m par­cel in Wood­lands In­dus­trial Park E8 will con­tain 10 to 14 wake halls, em­balm­ing fa­cil­i­ties, as well as florists, a food and bev­er­age out­let, and shops sell­ing fu­ner­ary goods and para­pher­na­lia.</p>
    <p>The ten­der will close at noon on Nov 5, and the site is ex­pected to be op­er­a­tional about four years af­ter the award of the ten­der.</p>
    <p>“As a small and densely pop­u­lated city state, there will always be com­pet­ing re­quire­ments for space to meet Sin­ga­pore’s var­i­ous de­vel­op­ment needs,” NEA said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter-death fa­cil­i­ties are im­por­tant pub­lic in­fra­struc­ture that ac­cords dig­nity to the de­ceased, as well as com­fort to be­reaved fam­i­lies and their vis­i­tors, in ac­cor­dance with re­li­gious and cul­tural prac­tices and pref­er­ences.”</p>
    <p>NEA also em­pha­sised that it will min­imise dis­rup­tion to res­i­dents nearby through sen­si­tive de­signs and a de­sign re­view process.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, no open-air burn­ing will be per­mit­ted, and there will be park­ing spots in the fa­cil­ity to pre­vent po­ten­tial traf­fic jams.</p>
    <p>Fu­ner­ary ac­tiv­i­ties will also be kept within the fa­cil­ity and be ap­pro­pri­ately screened to keep them discreet.</p>
    <p>NEA said it will con­tinue to work with agen­cies to meet the longterm de­mand for funeral spa­ces and en­sure they are ready ahead of de­mand, with res­i­dent deaths in Sin­ga­pore pro­jected to dou­ble to 40,000 an­nu­ally by 2040.</p>
    <p>The other three com­plexes that have been planned are in Mandai Road, the in­dus­trial area in Bukit Ba­tok Street 23, and in Ang Mo Kio Street 63, near the SBS Tran­sit bus de­pot.</p>
    <p>Last month, NEA – the lead plan­ning agency for af­ter-death fa­cil­i­ties and ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore – also an­nounced a 12-month study of the funeral in­dus­try so that it has a ready pool of com­pe­tent work­ers to uphold the dig­nity of the de­ceased.</p>
    <p>The agency seeks to en­sure that stan­dards of­fered match the best prac­tices in other coun­tries.</p>
