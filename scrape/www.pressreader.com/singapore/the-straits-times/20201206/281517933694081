    </section>

    <p>The ar­dent job of pre­sent­ing five Sin­ga­pore Ex­change-listed stocks that per­formed bril­liantly in the first 11 months of this year starts with some sim­ple ob­jec­tiv­ity and rea­son­ing.</p>
    <p>First, the five were among the 50 most traded stocks on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX). Se­cond, they gen­er­ated the strong­est gains and were the best per­form­ers in their re­spec­tive in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>The five stocks’ vi­brancy also ex­tended to mul­ti­ple mile­stones, with a num­ber of notable ac­co­lades be­yond the heavy trad­ing par­tic­i­pa­tion and solid share price per­for­mances. Go­ing into 2020, just one of the five was a Straits Times In­dex (STI) con­stituent, un­der­scor­ing the im­por­tance of keep­ing an eye be­yond the stock bench­mark.</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>Medtecs In­ter­na­tional Cor­po­ra­tion</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ers and dis­trib­u­tors of med­i­cal sup­plies, in­clud­ing rub­ber gloves and per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE), have gen­er­ated ex­po­nen­tial re­turns in the year to date. Be­sides Catal­ist-listed Medtecs, an­other three stocks – sec­ondary-listed Top Glove Cor­po­ra­tion, River­stone Hold­ings and Catal­ist-listed UG Health­care – could eas­ily have been in­cluded in this col­umn on sig­nif­i­cant turnover growth and in­stances of share price re­turns par­al­lel­ing fi­nan­cial re­turns.</p>
    <p>When it comes to this genre this year, Medtecs saw the most share price re­turns and turnover of this in­dus­try, soar­ing more than 2,200 per cent from 3.7 cents per share to 87.5 cents. The stock has av­er­aged more in daily turnover this year ($21 mil­lion) than it main­tained in mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion at the end of last year ($20 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>For its first nine months of FY20 (ended Sept 30), Medtecs re­ported a 1,442 per cent in­crease in its gross profit. This has been mostly at­trib­uted to the ex­port­ing of PPE to over 30 coun­tries in</p>
    <p>South-east Asia, North Asia, the United States, Aus­tralia and Europe. It also serves as a one-stop ven­dor to hos­pi­tals, sup­ply­ing PPE, work­wear and med­i­cal con­sum­ables to more than 200 hos­pi­tals in Tai­wan and the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Other notable ac­co­lades this year in­clude join­ing the MSCI Sin­ga­pore Small Cap In­dex on Nov 30 and the board propos­ing to ap­ply for a trans­fer from Catal­ist to the main board.</p>
    <p>On Nov 18, Medtecs chief ex­ec­u­tive Wil­liam Yang, who has over 10 years’ ex­pe­ri­ence in the tex­tile in­dus­try, ac­quired one mil­lion shares of the com­pany at an av­er­age price of 92.2 cents per share.</p>
    <p>The group in­tends to in­crease its mar­ket share in the US by sup­ply­ing lo­cally man­u­fac­tured face masks start­ing in the first quar­ter of FY21, while key growth mar­kets in the Asia-Pa­cific such as Sin­ga­pore, the Philip­pines and Tai­wan re­main. It is also aim­ing to raise pro­duc­tiv­ity by sys­tem­at­i­cally au­tomat­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing pro­cesses and en­hanc­ing em­ployee train­ing and ed­u­ca­tion pro­grammes to re­main com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>AEM Hold­ings</p>
    <p>The com­pany still ranks among the 30 most traded stocks this year with more than $20 mil­lion of shares chang­ing hands daily. AEM is one of the few stocks that have seen net in­flows by both in­sti­tu­tional and re­tail i nvestors this year, with liq­uid­ity providers ac­count­ing for the out­flows.</p>
    <p>As a provider of ap­pli­ca­tion spe­cific in­tel­li­gent sys­tem test and han­dling so­lu­tions for semi­con­duc­tor and elec­tron­ics busi­nesses, AEM has seen its share price con­tinue to gain this year. The price has moved from $2 at the end of last year to over $3.50 by early this month.</p>
    <p>This means the stock has ral­lied 74 per cent this year. More­over, AEM main­tains its sta­tus as the best per­form­ing global tech­nol­ogy stock with a cur­rent mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion above US$500 mil­lion (S$666 mil­lion) since the global rerat­ing of tech­nol­ogy stocks at the be­gin­ning of 2016.</p>
    <p>On Nov 3, AEM raised its FY2020 (end­ing Dec 31) rev­enue guid­ance to be be­tween $500 mil­lion and $520 mil­lion based on the sales or­der vis­i­bil­ity and busi­ness out­look. It also re­ported a record FY19 fi­nan­cial per­for­mance, achiev­ing rev­enue of $323 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Em­ploy­ees Prov­i­dent Fund Board of Malaysia emerged as a sub­stan­tial share­holder of AEM early l ast month. Re­cent years have also seen AEM fre­quently la­belled a growth stock with a 1.9 times price-to-sales ra­tio. The com­pany has built up its ca­pa­bil­i­ties in ad­vanced test­ing so­lu­tions over the past few years.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>Kep­pel DC Reit</p>
    <p>The com­pany was again the best per­former of the S-Reit sec­tor in the year to date, af­ter win­ning the ti­tle last year. From its de­but in De­cem­ber 2014, Asia’s first pure-play listed data cen­tre made it into the STI in less than six years, join­ing it on Oct 19.</p>
    <p>The Reit de­buted with a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of $821 mil­lion, with a string of ac­qui­si­tions see­ing its mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion grow more than five­fold to $4.7 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Its port­fo­lio as­sets un­der man­age­ment (AUM) have grown from $1 bil­lion to $2.9 bil­lion as at Sept 30, ex­clud­ing In­tel­li­cen­tre 3 East Data Cen­tre with de­vel­op­ment ex­pected for com­ple­tion in the first half of FY21.</p>
    <p>With over 40 per cent to­tal re­turn, Kep­pel DC Reit has been the eighth-best per­former of all global Reits with cur­rent mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion above $500 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Since its list­ing, Kep­pel Reit has also out­paced the world’s big­gest data cen­tre Reit, Equinix.</p>
    <p>For its first nine months of FY20 (ended Sept 30), Kep­pel Reit’s net profit grew 37 per cent from the same pe­riod in FY19, at­trib­uted to widespread lock­downs con­tribut­ing to an ac­cel­er­ated adop­tion of dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy. Its 9MFY20 dis­tri­bu­tion per unit in­creased 16.5 per cent year on year to 6.7 cents while dis­tributable in­come went up 41.2 per cent to $115.5 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Reit also se­cured new take­ups at co-lo­ca­tion fa­cil­i­ties in Sin­ga­pore and Dublin, as well as early lease re­newal at iseek Data Cen­tre in Bris­bane, Aus­tralia. Data cen­tres lo­cated in the Asia-Pa­cific make up ap­prox­i­mately 70 per cent of the port­fo­lio AUM.</p>
    <p>With re­gard to its ten­ants, In­ter­net En­ter­prise un­der the trade sec­tor makes up close to 50 per cent of the port­fo­lio’s ren­tal in­come.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the min­utes in the FY18 an­nual gen­eral meet­ing, Kep­pel DC Reit Man­age­ment re­it­er­ated its pol­icy of not shar­ing ten­ant names. This was due to con­fi­den­tial­ity to the lo­ca­tion of the data cen­tres, an im­por­tant part of client re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries</p>
    <p>On Sept 11, Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries (SCI) de­merged from Sem­b­corp Ma­rine (SCM) to be­come a fo­cused en­ergy and ur­ban busi­ness, with a re­newed man­date to un­lock value for in­vestors.</p>
    <p>SCI is Sin­ga­pore’s largest cap­i­talised util­ity stock and has a bal­anced ther­mal and re­new­able en­ergy port­fo­lio of over 12,600MW, with more than 2,600MW of re­new­able en­ergy ca­pac­ity glob­ally.</p>
    <p>The de­merger saw SCI shift its pre­vi­ous SCI stake in the re­cap­i­talised SCM to SCI share­hold­ers, in the form of 4.911 SCM se­cu­ri­ties for every one ex­ist­ing SCI se­cu­rity. Tak­ing into ac­count this cor­po­rate ac­tion on share­holder re­turns, SCI has gen­er­ated more than 30 per cent to­tal re­turns in the year to date. SCI’s share price has so far surged 47 per cent. This placed SCI as the strong­est per­former on the STI, which gained 14 per cent by com­par­i­son.</p>
    <p>On the mega trends, SCI an­nounced it had signed a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing to study the use of in­te­grated en­ergy so­lu­tions to power data cen­tres with Cap­i­taLand and SP Group.</p>
    <p>One of the tar­geted out­comes for SCI in the part­ner­ship is to de­ter­mine the most ef­fi­cient de­ploy­ment for green hy­dro­gen fuel cell tech­nolo­gies in Sin­ga­pore to re­duce the car­bon foot­print of data cen­tres. The an­nounce­ment also cited a June re­port by the In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Agency, that global data cen­tre elec­tric­ity de­mand last year con­trib­uted close to 1 per cent of global de­mand and was equiv­a­lent to the an­nual con­sump­tion of about 47 mil­lion four-room HDB flats and 83.76 mil­lion tonnes of car­bon emis­sions.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>Sheng Siong Group</p>
    <p>The stock of Sheng Siong Group (SSG) has also ral­lied more than 30 per cent in the year to date fol­low­ing a 21 per cent to­tal re­turn last year. The stock has re­mained in the top 50 stocks by turnover this year, af­ter rank­ing among the top 70 stocks by turnover last year.</p>
    <p>For its first nine months of FY20 (ended Sept 30), SSG re­ported 48 per cent growth in its gross profit from the same pe­riod in FY19. The group’s bal­ance sheet re­mained healthy with net cash of $180 mil­lion as at Sept 30, which is up from $76 mil­lion at the end of FY19.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial re­sults co­in­cided with el­e­vated su­per­mar­ket de­mand since Fe­bru­ary, which peaked in April and May and eased fol­low­ing the lift­ing of the cir­cuit breaker in June. SSG has noted that de­mand ap­peared to have sta­bilised in the third quar­ter of FY20, al­beit higher than preCovid-19 lev­els.</p>
    <p>The group has main­tained ex­pec­ta­tions since June that com­pe­ti­tion in the su­per­mar­ket in­dus­try will re­main keen and chal­leng­ing among the tra­di­tional brick-and­mor­tar op­er­a­tors and e-com­merce plat­forms, which have gained a larger share since the on­set of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1985 by Mr Lim Hock Eng, Mr Lim Hock Chee and Mr Lim Hock Leng, SSG has grown its pres­ence to 64 out­lets, pri­mar­ily lo­cated in re­tail lo­ca­tions in the heart­land of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>SSG’s main source of growth is the open­ing of new stores in high­den­sity hous­ing ar­eas and ar­eas where it does not have a pres­ence. Dur­ing the re­cent quar­ter, SSG opened two new stores at 6 Po­tong Pasir Av­enue 2 and Tampines Street 86 Block 872C with a re­tail area of 4,600 sq ft and 8,500 sq ft re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent busi­ness up­date, Mr Lim Hock Chee said the group would con­tinue with its ef­forts in en­hanc­ing gross mar­gin via higher sales mix of fresh pro­duce and more ef­fi­ciency gains in the sup­ply chain.</p>
