    <p>Mr Jacky Tham, 73, and his wife, Madam Mary Ng, 71, got more than their usual round of ex­er­cise and ac­tiv­i­ties at the Fei Yue Se­nior Ac­tiv­ity Cen­tre near their home in Senja Road yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>With the help of vol­un­teers, they also re­deemed cof­fee and pack­ets of cooked food from an au­to­mated food bank vend­ing ma­chine.</p>
    <p>The vend­ing ma­chines are part of a new ini­tia­tive launched by lo­cal or­gan­i­sa­tions to sup­ple­ment cur­rent ones seek­ing to ease food in­se­cu­rity for house­holds and se­niors who live in rental blocks or one- to two-room stu­dio apart­ments around Senja Road and the Zhenghua dis­trict.</p>
    <p>El­i­gi­ble res­i­dents will get a card giv­ing them $50 in cred­its per month from non-profit group The Food Bank Sin­ga­pore, which they can use to re­deem dried or cooked food from three vend­ing ma­chines lo­cated in Senja Road.</p>
    <p>Founded in 2012, The Food Bank Sin­ga­pore serves 300,000 peo­ple through their net­work of 370 non­govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions which seek to al­le­vi­ate food in­se­cu­rity in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The cooked food pack­ets, val­ued at three cred­its, are pre­pared by an ex­ter­nal caterer and flash-frozen for hy­giene pur­poses. Res­i­dents can ei­ther heat the food pack­ets in a mi­crowave oven near the ma­chines or take them home to thaw later.</p>
    <p>The dried food­stuff, val­ued at two cred­its a por­tion, is col­lected by The Food Bank Sin­ga­pore from its donors, which in­clude su­per­mar­kets and schools.</p>
    <p>Mr Edward Chia, MP for Hol­land-Bukit Timah GRC’s Zhenghua ward, said he heard through the grapevine that The Food Bank Sin­ga­pore was go­ing to roll out more au­to­mated vend­ing ma­chines fol­low­ing a pilot last year.</p>
    <p>But, ac­cord­ing to the non-profit group’s co-founder Ni­chol Ng, 42, it faced chal­lenges in find­ing ap­pro­pri­ate lo­ca­tions “within view of peo­ple and... (with) wiring and power points”.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia reached out to Ms Ng to ask if the ma­chines could be placed in Zhenghua. They then spoke to Fei Yue Se­nior Ac­tiv­ity Cen­tre, which agreed to house the ma­chines near the cen­tre and pro­vide vol­un­teers to re­stock the sup­ply of dried goods and as­sist se­niors in us­ing the ma­chines.</p>
    <p>Zhenghua Cit­i­zens’ Con­sul­ta­tive Com­mit­tee also pitched in to help co­or­di­nate with other or­gan­i­sa­tions in set­ting up the ma­chines.</p>
    <p>Zhenghua Con­stituency Of­fice has sent more than 500 let­ters to el­i­gi­ble house­holds so far.</p>
    <p>This pilot will run un­til Dec 31 next year, with a re­view by the or­gan­i­sa­tions af­ter that.</p>
    <p>Mr Chia said the re­view will look at the re­demp­tion rate of the monthly $50 cred­its. “It is a lot of ef­fort by dif­fer­ent or­gan­i­sa­tions. Our whole ob­jec­tive is to serve our re­source-low fam­i­lies... and we want this to be fully utilised by our res­i­dents,” he added.</p>
