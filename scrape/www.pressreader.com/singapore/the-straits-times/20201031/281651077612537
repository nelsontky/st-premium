    <p>The clo­sure of the two re­main­ing Robin­sons depart­ment stores here is a “strong sig­nal” that com­pa­nies will have to con­tinue to trans­form to meet the chang­ing needs of con­sumers, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo, who was on a visit to pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing com­pany 3D Me­tal­forge, a lo­cal small and medium-sized en­ter­prise, was re­spond­ing to ques­tions from re­porters about the news of Robin­sons’ exit from Sin­ga­pore’s phys­i­cal re­tail scene.</p>
    <p>“I must say, for me per­son­ally, I cer­tainly feel a sense of loss be­cause Robin­sons has been part of our grow­ing up years, it is so much a part of Sin­ga­pore’s re­tail land­scape,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I am sure many peo­ple, many Sin­ga­pore­ans, feel like­wise.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo noted, how­ever, that the younger gen­er­a­tion may feel dif­fer­ently about this clo­sure as they are more likely to be fa­mil­iar with e-com­merce plat­forms such as Lazada and Shopee.</p>
    <p>“It does sig­nal very strongly that our in­dus­tries are go­ing to con­tinue to have to trans­form,” she added. “The land­scape of con­sumers, the land­scape of busi­nesses, is not go­ing to stay static. If noth­ing else, Covid-19 has ac­cel­er­ated all of the trans­for­ma­tion.”</p>
    <p>And while some re­tail­ers and busi­nesses have been forced to shut­ter dur­ing this pe­riod, oth­ers have suc­ceeded in trans­form­ing their busi­ness and are see­ing growth po­ten­tial, such as SK Jewellery, said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, she vis­ited the home-grown jewellery re­tailer’s head­quar­ters in Changi Busi­ness Park with Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing to find out more about the com­pany’s ef­forts to boost its busi­ness on­line.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mrs Teo said SK Jewellery is an ex­am­ple of a re­tailer that has con­tin­ued to make it­self rel­e­vant in the face of chang­ing con­sumer be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>“This is go­ing to be the on­go­ing story of our econ­omy. Busi­nesses will have to trans­form and, along with them, their em­ploy­ees. But what emerges po­ten­tially could be a more ex­cit­ing land­scape,” she said.</p>
