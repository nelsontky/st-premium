    <p>I was prob­a­bly one of the first here to write about Net­flix back in 2012, when I found ways to watch the stream­ing ser­vice even though it was ge­o­graph­i­cally “blocked” in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>I re­mem­ber call­ing on my in­ner geek and us­ing a com­bi­na­tion of VPN smarts, pre-paid Visa cards bought over the counter in the United States and fake US ad­dresses to un­lock this amaz­ing world.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when Net­flix launched in Sin­ga­pore about four years ago, VPN ac­cess here was cur­tailed and we were ef­fec­tively forced to watch the Sin­ga­pore ver­sion, which had limited con­tent then. Frus­trated, I even can­celled my sub­scrip­tion for a few months.</p>
    <p>These days, I am happy as I have the best of both worlds. I subscribe to ViewQwest for my home broad­band line, which has VPN built into the net­work, to get</p>
    <p>Net­flix US and switch to my mo­bile broad­band line when I want to watch the lo­cal ver­sion.</p>
    <p>If like me, you are a geek at heart and you plan to get a sim­i­lar setup, here are my top five Net­flix picks for geeks.</p>
    <p>This re­cently re­leased six-part doc­u­men­tary fo­cuses on the key mile­stones and peo­ple be­hind the rise of video games.</p>
    <p>It brought back mem­o­ries for me as I re­lived my days of play­ing</p>
    <p>Space In­vaders and Pac­man at the arcade.</p>
    <p>I grew up in Kuala Lumpur and was 12 when my mum bought me the Atari 2600. I re­mem­ber my pitch to her – we would save a load of money if I could play “TV games” (it wasn’t called game con­sole then) in­stead of spend­ing loads at the arcade.</p>
    <p>I was truly sur­prised when I ac­tu­ally got it be­cause it cost my mum a princely sum. I think she may have bought it to make up for send­ing me away to Sin­ga­pore to study the very next year.</p>
    <p>High Score closely fol­lows the evo­lu­tion of the con­sole mar­ket, mov­ing to Nin­tendo af­ter Atari died and then to the ma­jor bat­tles between Nin­tendo En­ter­tain­ment Sys­tem and Sega Ge­n­e­sis.</p>
    <p>The se­ries also looks at role-play­ing games, the early days of e-sports, and clas­sics such as Ul­tima, Doom, Street Fighter, Mor­tal Kom­bat and more.</p>
    <p>The se­ries ends at the ar­rival of 3D gam­ing via the twin ter­rors of Doom and Star Fox, and left me beg­ging for more. Hope­fully, there will be a sec­ond sea­son.</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>Toys That Made Us</p>
    <p>A must-watch for older geeks, this se­ries retells the ori­gins of the toys that made us the geeks we are today.</p>
    <p>I grew up poor, so I could only pine for these ex­pen­sive toys in my time, but they were some of the stuff I de­sired as a kid – Star Wars, Star Trek, Trans­form­ers, He-Man and the Mas­ters of The Uni­verse, and G.I. Joe toys.</p>
    <p>There were also Teenage Mu­tant Ninja Tur­tles (launched when I was a teenager) and Power Rangers.</p>
    <p>The se­ries also cov­ers the toys of some cool fran­chises for girls (which have burned some nasty holes in my pocket, as a fa­ther of three girls) such as Bar­bie, Hello Kitty and My Lit­tle Pony.</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>Speed Cu­bers</p>
    <p>2020</p>
    <p>Avail­able on Net­flix US and SG</p>
    <p>The Ru­bik’s Cube was the af­ford­able toy for the poor kid and I re­mem­ber por­ing through guide­books to solve it.</p>
    <p>These days, you can get free vir­tual ver­sions and scour YouTube for step-by-step so­lu­tions. Speed Cu­bers talks about com­pet­i­tive Ru­bik’s Cube solv­ing, and fol­lows the sto­ries of two world cham­pi­ons Max Park and Fe­liks Zemdegs.</p>
    <p>It’s amaz­ing to see so many peo­ple able to solve the Ru­bik’s Cube in un­der seven sec­onds, some­times with just one hand.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>The Witcher</p>
    <p>2019</p>
    <p>Avail­able on Net­flix US and SG</p>
    <p>If you play video games, this is a must-watch.</p>
    <p>The Witcher was vir­tu­ally un­known to geeks in this part of the world un­til the games based on the books by Pol­ish writer An­drzej Sap­kowski were launched.</p>
    <p>The Witcher 3 game was a huge suc­cess, sweep­ing up more awards than women bed­ded by the mon­ster-hunter pro­tag­o­nist</p>
    <p>Ger­alt of Rivia.</p>
    <p>The Net­flix se­ries stars Henry Cav­ill (I was sur­prised my wife, who is crazy about the ac­tor, didn’t like the se­ries, though).</p>
    <p>Caveat: This Net­flix Orig­i­nal is dif­fi­cult to fol­low if you are not an avid Witcher fan, be­cause it closely fol­lows the script of The Last Wish, the first of two col­lec­tions of short sto­ries pre­ced­ing the story of the main Witcher books.</p>
    <p>But, while it may be con­fus­ing for noobs, it is sub­lime for fans.</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>League Of Le­gends Ori­gins</p>
    <p>LOL is not just the ir­ri­tat­ing term my mil­len­nial friends and Gen Z daugh­ters use on me.</p>
    <p>It also stands for League of Le­gends, which is now one of the top game fran­chises in the world.</p>
    <p>The com­pet­i­tive 5vs5 game is huge, with mil­lions of fans and a US$2.5 mil­lion (S$3.4 mil­lion) prize pool for this year’s in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion, which starts next month.</p>
    <p>This 77-min doc­u­men­tary traces how the game started, its strug­gles in the early years and how it be­came the huge suc­cess it is today.</p>
