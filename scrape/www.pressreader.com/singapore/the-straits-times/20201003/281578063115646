    <p>Google, Ama­zon.com, Ap­ple and Face­book abuse their power as gate­keep­ers of the In­ter­net, said United States law­maker David Ci­cilline, who is set to pro­pose leg­isla­tive changes to rein in the tech­nol­ogy gi­ants.</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Al­pha­bet’s Google, Ama­zon.com, Ap­ple and Face­book abuse their power as gate­keep­ers of the In­ter­net, said the head of a House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives an­titrust panel who is set to pro­pose leg­isla­tive changes to rein in the tech­nol­ogy gi­ants.</p>
    <p>“Each plat­form uses their gate­keeper po­si­tion to pro­tect their own power,” said Rep­re­sen­ta­tive David Ci­cilline, who chairs a House an­titrust panel that has spent more than a year prob­ing the dom­i­nance of the In­ter­net plat­forms.</p>
    <p>“By con­trol­ling the in­fras­truc­ture of the dig­i­tal age, they have surveilled other busi­nesses to iden­tify po­ten­tial ri­vals – and ul­ti­mately bought out, copied, or cut off their com­pet­i­tive threats.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ci­cilline, who was speak­ing on Thurs­day dur­ing a hear­ing with ex­perts on com­pe­ti­tion law, is prepar­ing a fi­nal re­port rec­om­mend­ing changes to the leg­isla­tive and reg­u­la­tory frame­work. That re­port is set to be re­leased next week.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Ken Buck, who has worked closely with Demo­crat Mr Ci­cilline on the probe, told Bloomberg TV that he ex­pects the com­mit­tee’s re­port next week.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to make sure that we keep high tech com­pet­i­tive so that smaller, in­no­va­tive com­pa­nies can com­pete,” said Mr Buck, not­ing that the re­port could be bi­par­ti­san but he had not yet read it.</p>
    <p>Mr Sun­dar Pichai, Mr Jeff Be­zos, Mr Tim Cook and Mr Mark Zucker­berg tes­ti­fied vol­un­tar­ily in July be­fore the sub­com­mit­tee.</p>
    <p>Mr Ci­cilline has crit­i­cised their tes­ti­mony as be­ing eva­sive and non-re­spon­sive and said “they raised new ques­tions about whether they be­lieve their com­pa­nies are be­yond over­sight”.</p>
    <p>Rep­re­sen­ta­tives from Ap­ple, Face­book and Google did not re­spond to re­quests for com­ment on Mr Ci­cilline’s re­marks. Ama­zon de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>Among the rec­om­men­da­tions that Mr Ci­cilline has floated is a pro­hi­bi­tion against run­ning a plat­form and com­pet­ing on it at the same time. That would po­ten­tially bar Google from bid­ding in the on­line ad ex­changes it op­er­ates or stop Ama­zon from pro­vid­ing a mar­ket­place for in­de­pen­dent mer­chants while sell­ing its own prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Mr Ci­cilline has said he wants bi­par­ti­san sup­port for his ideas, but has not re­vealed whether he has Repub­li­can sup­port for his pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Party typ­i­cally views changes to an­titrust law scep­ti­cally. Although some of the com­mit­tee’s Repub­li­cans have been crit­i­cal of some of the tech com­pa­nies’ prac­tices, not all agree that new leg­is­la­tion is nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>“We ul­ti­mately dis­agree on the fu­ture of an­titrust laws,” said Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Jim Sensen­bren­ner, the top Repub­li­can on the panel. He sug­gested that he wants to see im­proved en­force­ment of ex­ist­ing laws, but is op­posed to changes that would prompt break-ups of the com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>For decades, the In­ter­net gi­ants have en­joyed lais­sez-faire reg­u­la­tion in the United States, in­clud­ing scant an­titrust en­force­ment of mergers. Still, they are com­ing un­der in­creas­ing at­tack in Wash­ing­ton over a range of is­sues in­clud­ing mis­in­for­ma­tion, hate speech, elec­tion med­dling, and what Repub­li­cans de­cry as anti-con­ser­va­tive bias.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral and state an­titrust en­forcers are also poised to file a his­toric mo­nop­o­li­sa­tion law­suit against Google, and ad­di­tional cases could be in the pipe­line, Bloomberg has re­ported.</p>
    <p>The US Fed­eral Trade Com­mis­sion is also prepar­ing a pos­si­ble case against Face­book. Ama­zon and Ap­ple are also fac­ing in­quiries by the fed­eral an­titrust au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Wit­nesses at the hear­ing in­cluded Mr Bill Baer, a for­mer Justice De­part­ment an­titrust chief un­der pres­i­dent Barack Obama; Pro­fes­sor Ze­phyr Tea­chout, a law ex­pert at Ford­ham Univer­sity known for pro­gres­sive views on an­titrust; and Ms Rachel Bo­vard of the con­ser­va­tive-al­lied In­ter­net Ac­count­abil­ity Project.</p>
    <p>Mr Baer called for Congress to pass leg­is­la­tion to make it eas­ier for en­forcers to stop mergers be­cause past court rul­ings have made it too hard for the gov­ern­ment to win cases. It’s “nearly im­pos­si­ble” to stop dom­i­nant com­pa­nies from buy­ing smaller ri­vals that could be­come fu­ture com­peti­tors, like Face­book’s acquisitio­ns of In­sta­gram and What­sApp, he said.</p>
