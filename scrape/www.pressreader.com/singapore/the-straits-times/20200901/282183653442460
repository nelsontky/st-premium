    <p>Mar­ket­ing and com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager An­drea Ang en­joys re­lax­ing in the bal­cony of her five-room Hous­ing Board (HDB) flat when she is stressed. Af­ter all, her home on the 21st floor in Craw­ford Lane over­looks the his­toric and colour­ful district of Kam­pong Glam.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old can also see the win­dows of her par­ents’ five-room HDB flat, just a street away in North Bridge Road.</p>
    <p>“There’s a run­ning joke in my fam­ily that my par­ents can wave a flag at their win­dow when din­ner is ready and we’ll just walk over,” said Ms Ang, who is an only child.</p>
    <p>Five years ago, Ms Ang and her hus­band Gary Lim, 39, who works as a di­rec­tor of pho­tog­ra­phy, had specif­i­cally searched for re­sale units within walk­ing dis­tance of her par­ents’ flat, where she grew up.</p>
    <p>Now that she is work­ing from home, the de­ci­sion to live near her par­ents, who are in their 60s, has paid off, she said. She goes to their place an av­er­age of four times a week, some­times for a meal and other times just to chat.</p>
    <p>“This area feels very much like home to me. As much as it has seen me grow up, I have also wit­nessed the change and de­vel­op­ment in this neigh­bour­hood. I can­not imagine liv­ing any­where else,” she said.</p>
    <p>For Ms Ang and many other Sin­ga­pore­ans, their homes have taken on added sig­nif­i­cance amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Most have never spent as much time in their homes as they have in the past few months, in line with the au­thor­i­ties urg­ing peo­ple to work from home where pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Ms Ang said that grow­ing up, she never imag­ined the quaint neigh­bour­hood of Kam­pong Glam, now a thriv­ing arts and cul­tural district, would be­come as pop­u­lar as it is to­day.</p>
    <p>To live, work and play in the bustling cul­tural district where there is a blend of old and new is “pretty amaz­ing”, she said.</p>
    <p>“At the neigh­bour­hood shops, ev­ery­one knows ev­ery­one be­cause they’ve been there for ages. A few streets away, you also get the hip­ster cafes,” she added.</p>
    <p>One of her fond­est child­hood mem­o­ries is fol­low­ing her grand­mother to the nearby wet market in North Bridge Road to buy gro­ceries. Th­ese days, she still vis­its the same market.</p>
    <p>“It has been up­graded over the years, but what’s nice is that the char­ac­ter of the place is still in­tact, and the same community still goes there,” she said.</p>
    <p>The mix of old and new in the up­com­ing town of Bi­dadari is also what drew Mr Sathiya­si­van Balakrishn­an, a 31-year-old cus­tomer ser­vice of­fi­cer, to ap­ply for a Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flat there al­most five years ago.</p>
    <p>He and his wife Dur­gashini Sathiya­si­van, 28, a civil ser­vant, are ea­gerly wait­ing to move into their three-room flat early next year. It is cur­rently be­ing ren­o­vated.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple now live with Mr Sathiya­si­van’s mother in St Ge­orge’s Road in Boon Keng, where he has been liv­ing since he was 19.</p>
    <p>They had opted for the ma­ture estate of Bi­dadari for their first home be­cause they wanted to live in a cen­tral lo­ca­tion with es­tab­lished ameni­ties such as eater­ies.</p>
    <p>“For fes­ti­vals such as the Chi­na­town and Lit­tle In­dia light-ups, or the Ra­madan bazaar in Gey­lang Serai, we’ll be more likely to go be­cause it’s just a short bus ride away,” said Mr Sathiya­si­van.</p>
    <p>“Po­tong Pasir, which is just op­po­site our fu­ture house, has an old­school charm to it which we like as well,” he added.</p>
    <p>Sto­ries such as Ms Ang’s and Mr Sathiya­si­van’s have been among the fruits of HDB’s labour over the last six decades.</p>
    <p>In 1960, amid a se­vere hous­ing short­age, the HDB was es­tab­lished to build many flats quickly and cost-ef­fec­tively. Th­ese early flats were sim­ple and util­i­tar­ian, while the towns had ba­sic fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Since then, the HDB has con­tin­ued to build homes to cater to Sin­ga­pore­ans’ evolv­ing needs and as­pi­ra­tions. Around 1.2 mil­lion flats have been built so far.</p>
    <p>Green­ing ef­forts have been stepped up, with land­scaped spa­ces in­cor­po­rated through­out ev­ery hous­ing de­vel­op­ment, along with smart and sus­tain­able fea­tures in new towns such as Ten­gah.</p>
    <p>Older towns have also been systematic­ally up­graded through var­i­ous HDB pro­grammes – such as the Home Im­prove­ment Pro­gramme and the Re­mak­ing Our Heart­land pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Over 80 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans live in HDB flats, and nine out of 10 own their homes.</p>
    <p>In cel­e­bra­tion of its 60th an­niver­sary this year, the HDB has part­nered Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ Pho­ton­ico plat­form in a project – ti­tled “Shapes of Home” – to trace the evo­lu­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s pub­lic hous­ing jour­ney.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic are in­vited to take part in a photo con­test to share what home means to them.</p>
    <p>Win­ning en­tries will be pub­lished in The Straits Times and on the Pho­ton­ico web­site.</p>
    <p>ST will also run a se­ries of 10 Big Pic­ture pages ev­ery Wed­nes­day and Satur­day, start­ing this Satur­day, with ar­chive pho­tographs show­cas­ing life in HDB es­tates.</p>
    <p>The HDB said: “Through the years, ‘home’ has also tran­scended be­yond the phys­i­cal four walls, into the heart­land, es­tates and towns. Through this col­lab­o­ra­tion, we seek to cap­ture the shapes and forms of the HDB ‘home’ and ev­ery­day mo­ments of heart­land liv­ing though the eyes of Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
