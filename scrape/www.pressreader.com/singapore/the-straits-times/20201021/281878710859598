    <p>WASHINGTON Gold­man Sachs Group has reached a long-awaited pact with the US Depart­ment of Jus­tice to pay more than US$2 bil­lion (S$2.7 bil­lion) for the bank’s role in Malaysia’s 1MDB scan­dal, and the deal may be an­nounced within days, ac­cord­ing to sources.</p>
    <p>The ac­cord, part of an in­ter­na­tional ac­tion, will let the par­ent com­pany avoid a US crim­i­nal con­vic­tion, ac­cord­ing to the sources, who asked not to be named dis­cussing the con­fi­den­tial talks.</p>
    <p>The pay­ment to the Jus­tice Depart­ment is broadly in line with the bank’s prior re­serves and an­a­lysts’ es­ti­mates.</p>
    <p>The deal, ex­pected to come just weeks be­fore the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, would re­move un­cer­tainty for the bank fol­low­ing years of in­ves­ti­ga­tions and ne­go­ti­a­tions with the Jus­tice Depart­ment over the firm’s fund rais­ing for the 1MDB in­vest­ment fund.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows an agree­ment in July to set­tle a re­lated probe with Malaysia, in which the bank promised to pay US$2.5 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Malaysia dropped crim­i­nal charges against the New York­based com­pany early last month.</p>
    <p>A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for Gold­man Sachs de­clined to com­ment, and rep­re­sen­ta­tives for the Jus­tice Depart­ment did not re­spond to mes­sages seek­ing com­ment.</p>
    <p>In all, Gold­man Sachs may pay roughly US$5 bil­lion once ac­cords with Malaysia, the Jus­tice Depart­ment and other agen­cies are tal­lied to­gether.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the au­thor­i­ties plan to levy a fi­nan­cial penalty and is­sue a warn­ing with con­di­tions, and if the com­pany breaches them, Gold­man Sin­ga­pore could be pros­e­cuted, sources said. The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore, At­tor­neyGen­eral’s Cham­bers and po­lice did not im­me­di­ately re­ply to an e-mail seek­ing com­ment.</p>
    <p>Probes of the Wall Street firm fo­cused on its work rais­ing US$6.5 bil­lion in 2012 and 2013 for the fund for­mally known as 1Malaysia Devel­op­ment Ber­had, much of which was later al­legedly si­phoned off by peo­ple con­nected to the coun­try’s for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak.</p>
    <p>Gold­man’s in­vest­ment banking group, led at the time by cur­rent chief ex­ec­u­tive David Solomon, col­lected US$600 mil­lion from the bond sales.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in Asia, the US and Europe have spent years trac­ing out the con­spir­acy and track­ing down cash and as­sets around the globe, in­clud­ing lux­ury prop­er­ties, jew­ellery and art.</p>
    <p>Gold­man has long blamed rogue em­ploy­ees, as­sert­ing it had no idea the money it helped raise would be di­verted from devel­op­ment projects. For­mer Gold­man Sachs part­ner Tim Leiss­ner pleaded guilty in the US to con­spir­ing to laun­der money and vi­o­lat­ing for­eign bribery laws. An­other ex­ec­u­tive was charged with for­eign bribery of­fences.</p>
