    <p>COPENHAGEN • Euro­pean Union states will start Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions in nine days.</p>
    <p>The Dec 27 start date – con­firmed by EU Com­mis­sion chief Ur­sula von der Leyen, Aus­tria, Ger­many and Italy – will come al­most three weeks af­ter the world’s first fully tested Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion was ad­min­is­tered in Eng­land.</p>
    <p>A se­nior EU of­fi­cial said on Wed­nes­day that the bloc could give its fi­nal ap­proval for the vac­cine, de­vel­oped by Pfizer and BioNTech, next Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Dr von der Leyen con­firmed the planned timetable for the start of in­oc­u­la­tions for the EU’s 450 mil­lion ci­ti­zens.</p>
    <p>“On 27, 28 and 29 De­cem­ber, vac­ci­na­tion will start across the EU,” she wrote on Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>Europe is now play­ing catch-up with Bri­tain and the United States af­ter what some have crit­i­cised as a slow EU ap­proval process for the shots.</p>
    <p>The spot of good news comes as in­fec­tions con­tin­ued to soar on the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>Ger­many yes­ter­day re­ported a daily record of new cases of more than 30,000, a day af­ter it went un­der par­tial lock­down with nonessen­tial shops and schools shut.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously con­sid­ered a Euro­pean ex­am­ple for ef­fec­tive man­age­ment of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Ger­many has strug­gled to con­tain the virus since the end of the sum­mer hol­i­days and the on­set of colder weather.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s lat­est curbs will ap­ply un­til at least Jan 10.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Den­mark will move into a lock­down over Christ­mas af­ter the coun­try recorded its high­est-ever num­ber of daily new Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Across the coun­try yes­ter­day, malls closed, while all school-go­ing chil­dren who were not al­ready at­tend­ing lessons on­line will be sent home from next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>From Dec 25, all shops, ex­cept those that sell food and medicine, will be shut­tered. The lock­down will last into the first week of the new year.</p>
    <p>“The win­ter months may well be the most dif­fi­cult,” Prime Min­is­ter Mette Fred­erik­sen said. “To close so­ci­ety down is the most far-reach­ing de­ci­sion we can make in re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus.”</p>
    <p>“We’re, of course, do­ing ev­ery­thing” to avoid a pro­longed lock­down, but “right now, we need one”, she added.</p>
    <p>Den­mark, which like Ger­many had pre­vi­ously stood out for han­dling the pan­demic bet­ter than most other coun­tries, had al­ready closed restau­rants, bars, cafes and gyms in a par­tial lock­down ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>But as tem­per­a­tures dropped and Danes sought one an­other’s com­pany in­doors, the coro­n­avirus has con­tin­ued to spread.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, 3,692 Danes were re­ported as be­ing newly in­fected by the virus. That is the high­est num­ber recorded so far, with the sud­den in­crease only partly ex­plained by a rise in test­ing. The spike in new cases is putting un­prece­dented pres­sure on the Nordic coun­try’s uni­ver­sal health­care sys­tem. Hospi­tal au­thor­i­ties in the greater Copenhagen area have post­poned all non-ur­gent pro­ce­dures from next week, to free up re­sources.</p>
    <p>The lock­down will take its toll on the econ­omy, Ms Fred­erik­sen said.</p>
    <p>“Shut­ting down the econ­omy comes at a cost,” she added. “It did in the spring, and it will now.”</p>
    <p>Mr Soren Kris­tensen, chief econ­o­mist at Sy­d­bank, said he does not ex­pect the lat­est re­stric­tions to be as dev­as­tat­ing to the econ­omy as those in the spring. But he warned that busi­nesses were al­ready worn out.</p>
    <p>“In the spring, Dan­ish com­pa­nies en­tered the cri­sis with a very ro­bust econ­omy, but many of the hard­est-hit in­dus­tries are now stretched thin,” he said. “The Dan­ish econ­omy now faces the threat of higher un­em­ploy­ment and bank­rupt­cies.”</p>
    <p>The win­ter months may well be the most dif­fi­cult. To close so­ci­ety down is the most far-reach­ing de­ci­sion we can make in re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
