    <p>Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi is in the fir­ing line af­ter declar­ing his sup­port for Op­po­si­tion Leader An­war Ibrahim, fac­ing back­lash from lead­ers within his own party as well as its al­lies in Malaysia’s Perikatan Na­sional gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi is in the fir­ing line af­ter declar­ing his sup­port for Op­po­si­tion Leader An­war Ibrahim, fac­ing back­lash from lead­ers within his own party as well as its al­lies in Malaysia’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that talks sched­uled for Mon­day night be­tween the pro-Malay Mus­lim par­ties in the Muafakat Na­sional (MN) al­liance – Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) and Umno – were aban­doned at the 11th hour af­ter a stand-off with Zahid.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, an Umno Supreme Coun­cil pow­wow set to take place yes­ter­day to dis­cuss Zahid’s pro­posal to back Datuk Seri An­war’s bid to be­come prime min­is­ter was also called off, with party lead­ers at log­ger­heads over the is­sue.</p>
    <p>“The meet­ing has been can­celled af­ter more than a third of the Supreme Coun­cil ex­pressed their dis­plea­sure at Zahid’s plan. Cracks are widen­ing,” an Umno source told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The main bone of con­tention, say sources, was whether th­ese par­ties could work with Mr An­war and the Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) pact he leads.</p>
    <p>They ob­ject to work­ing with PH and, in par­tic­u­lar, one com­po­nent party, the Chi­nese-based Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party (DAP).</p>
    <p>MN was formed to de­fend Malay rights and priv­i­leges, which it claimed were be­ing eroded by PH at DAP’s in­sti­ga­tion when it was in gov­ern­ment from May 2018 to Fe­bru­ary this year.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial rea­son for th­ese can­celled meet­ings was that move­ment re­stric­tions are cur­rently in place in the cap­i­tal and the sur­round­ing Se­lan­gor state to curb soar­ing coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>But it is un­der­stood that party lead­ers were al­ready at Umno head­quar­ters in Kuala Lumpur be­fore the MN meet­ing was called off.</p>
    <p>Some PAS and Umno lead­ers have pub­licly ex­pressed dis­ap­proval of any pact with Mr An­war and DAP.</p>
    <p>“I was NOT con­sulted, and this is NOT my po­si­tion as an UMNO MP. I want to cat­e­gor­i­cally state that I do NOT sup­port @an­wari­brahim as PM. I have been con­sis­tent – NO AN­WAR NO DAP,” tweeted For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein, a for­mer party vice-pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Since Mr An­war’s bid to form the gov­ern­ment was first un­veiled late last month, spec­u­la­tion has been rife that he would be sup­ported by a fac­tion of Umno MPs. His PH pact has 91 MPs in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment; a min­i­mum of 112 law­mak­ers is needed to gain a ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>He had claimed af­ter an au­di­ence with the King on Oct 13 to have the sup­port of more than 120 law­mak­ers in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Umno ex­ec­u­tive sec­re­tary Su­mali Re­d­uan de­nied last Satur­day that the party pres­i­dent’s of­fice is­sued a let­ter to the Palace signed by Zahid and for­mer premier Na­jib Razak pledg­ing sup­port for Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>But of­fi­cial sources con­firmed that in a meet­ing at the week­end, Zahid, who holds no po­si­tion in the fed­eral ad­min­is­tra­tion, was ques­tioned by PAS coun­ter­part Hadi Awang and Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin as to why he would co­op­er­ate with Mr An­war and DAP.</p>
    <p>Just hours be­fore Mon­day’s MN meet­ing was can­celled, Datuk Seri Hadi wrote a post on Face­book con­demn­ing those “Busy Pol­i­tick­ing Dur­ing Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>“The pub­lic... suf­fer­ing f rom Covid-19 are con­founded by po­lit­i­cal up­heavals that should not be pri­ori­tised, what more mul­ti­plied un­til they vomit,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in the rul­ing PN pact have re­vealed to The Straits Times that in re­turn for con­tin­u­ing to sup­port Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s gov­ern­ment, Zahid is de­mand­ing a Cabi­net reshuf­fle that en­larges Umno’s role and for th­ese ap­point­ments to be based on “party hi­er­ar­chy”, which would mean the posts be­ing awarded to his sup­port­ers within the party.</p>
    <p>They add that Zahid is seek­ing to re­store his grip on the party, af­ter his au­thor­ity was un­der­mined by Mr Muhyid­din, who has pri­ori­tised his own party lieu­tenants and Zahid’s ri­vals in Umno since form­ing the gov­ern­ment in March.</p>
    <p>But Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia’s lead­er­ship has called on its pres­i­dent Muhyid­din not to re­lent.</p>
    <p>“We would rather face an elec­tion as op­posed to reshuf­fling the Cabi­net un­der threat from an ally. Af­ter all, if the gov­ern­ment col­lapses, the pub­lic would know that An­war and Umno caused it,” said a party of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>The post­pone­ment of the MN and Umno meet­ings buy Zahid time to re­group. While Mr An­war has not spec­i­fied ex­actly which MPs back him in ad­di­tion to those from PH, a sep­a­rate let­ter that has gone vi­ral in­di­cates that he counts Umno’s 39 as part of his sup­port.</p>
    <p>Some in PH be­lieve that even if their planned coun­ter­coup fails, the fact that it has caused huge di­vi­sions in PN is con­sid­ered a strate­gic vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Umno and PAS an­nounced yes­ter­day that they would for­mally reg­is­ter their MN al­liance, pledg­ing to strengthen co­op­er­a­tion in prepa­ra­tion for the next gen­eral elec­tion. The two par­ties have worked well, win­ning sev­eral by­elec­tions against PH since the be­gin­ning of last year.</p>
    <p>The main bone of con­tention, say sources, was whether th­ese par­ties could work with op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim and the Pakatan Hara­pan pact he leads. They ob­ject to work­ing with PH and, in par­tic­u­lar, one com­po­nent party, the Chi­nese-based Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party.</p>
