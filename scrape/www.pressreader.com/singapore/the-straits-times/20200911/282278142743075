    <p>LONDON • Tot­ten­ham will be ex­pe­ri­enc­ing their first sea­son with­out Cham­pi­ons League foot­ball af­ter an un­in­ter­rupted four-year spell, but they only need to look across the north London di­vide to see how dif­fi­cult it is to get back into the top four.</p>
    <p>This will be Arse­nal’s fourth suc­ces­sive Europa League cam­paign and with the gains made by their ri­vals on top of big-name sign­ings this sum­mer, get­ting back into that elite group has never been tougher for both Spurs and the Gun­ners.</p>
    <p>And yet Tot­ten­ham can­not set­tle for another sixth-place fin­ish while Arse­nal would need to im­prove on eighth spot – their worst fin­ish since 1995.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has hurt Jose Mour­inho’s team more than most. Spurs have not been able to fully reap the ben­e­fits of their new £1 bil­lion (S$1.77 bil­lion) Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur Sta­dium – which opened only in April last year – af­ter last sea­son was dis­rupted by a three-month stop­page from March.</p>
    <p>Fans were banned when the English Pre­mier League restarted in June and that will be the case when the new term re­sumes to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>While spec­ta­tors are ex­pected to be al­lowed back in some time later this year, it will be in re­stricted num­bers. Money is re­port­edly tight as there is no match-day rev­enue to con­trib­ute to the cof­fers.</p>
    <p>Build­ing on a re­stricted bud­get is not some­thing Mour­inho is ac­cus­tomed to, hav­ing splurged at pre­vi­ous clubs Chelsea and Manch­ester United. The Por­tuguese coach, ex­pected by the Spurs hi­er­ar­chy to de­liver tro­phies, has to evolve from be­ing a “cheque­book man­ager”, given Spurs’ cur­rent fi­nan­cial stand­ing, to one that works with what he has at his dis­posal.</p>
    <p>He has al­ready brought in Matt Do­herty and Pierre-Emile Ho­jb­jerg for mod­est sums, but he will have to sell be­fore mak­ing new ad­di­tions.</p>
    <p>De­spite miss­ing a big part of last sea­son with in­jury, Harry Kane was still their top scorer in the top flight with 18 goals in 29 ap­pear­ances and Mour­inho will be count­ing on the Eng­land skip­per to keep the club in the top-six mix.</p>
    <p>There will be more wheel­ing and deal­ing be­fore the trans­fer win­dow closes next month, but should they fail to get re­in­force­ments, the Spurs boss must some­how re­vi­talise Dele Alli.</p>
    <p>The mid­fielder did not start their last seven games last sea­son and was dropped by Eng­land for their Na­tions League games, and it is a con­cern with the club al­ready car­ry­ing a pas­sen­ger in club-record buy Tan­guy Ndombele.</p>
    <p>Like Mour­inho, Arse­nal coun­ter­part Mikel Arteta has mostly kept his pow­der dry in the mar­ket – only Gabriel has ar­rived for a de­cent fee.</p>
    <p>While there has been some talk of a big-name buy like Thomas Partey or Houssem Aouar, it has been re­ported the Gun­ners are in a sim­i­lar fi­nan­cial predica­ment, and will first need to trim the squad.</p>
    <p>There are signs, though, that cap­tain Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang may ex­tend his deal, which has less than a year to run. That would be a con­fi­dence-booster, es­pe­cially af­ter Arse­nal lost for­mer top scor­ers Alexis Sanchez and Robin van Per­sie when in sim­i­lar po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Wil­lian’s cap­ture could also end up be­ing a shrewd move, with his nine league goals the pre­vi­ous cam­paign more than dou­ble all of Arse­nal’s cen­tral mid­field­ers com­bined.</p>
    <p>In win­ning the FA Cup and the Com­mu­nity Shield, Arteta has re­paid the faith of the club’s hi­er­ar­chy when they ap­pointed him de­spite his lack of ex­pe­ri­ence, and he must kick on in his first full term.</p>
    <p>The play­ers also seem to have bought into his phi­los­o­phy, which does not de­vi­ate from Arse­nal’s at­tack­ing ethos, while be­ing more or­gan­ised than his pre­de­ces­sors.</p>
    <p>Wil­lian said at his sign­ing: “They have a new project with Mikel. This club de­serves to shine again and I want to be a part of this project.”</p>
    <p>Yet the over­rid­ing theme of that project is re­build­ing, and both Arse­nal and Spurs are in the same boat.</p>
    <p>It would not come as a sur­prise if both clubs pri­ori­tise the Europa League come the tail-end of the sea­son, as win­ning the com­pe­ti­tion, which en­tails Cham­pi­ons League foot­ball, may be an eas­ier prospect than a top-four fin­ish.</p>
