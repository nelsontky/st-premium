    <p>TAIPEI • Tai­wanese tele­vi­sion host Jacky Wu dis­cov­ered that he has a small kid­ney stone af­ter he was in­jured while film­ing out­door va­ri­ety show Mr Player last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Wu, 58, fell off a bi­cy­cle af­ter he went too fast on the road in Ping­tung in south­ern Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>He lost two teeth, suf­fered cuts to his hands and legs and broke his safety hel­met dur­ing the fall.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­turn­ing to Taipei last Thursday, he went to the hos­pi­tal for a brain scan and a check for pos­si­ble frac­tures.</p>
    <p>The re­port said he was fine other than a mi­nor con­cus­sion, but the scan found that he has a small kid­ney stone.</p>
    <p>Wu wrote on so­cial me­dia that it was not a big deal and that he re­sumed film­ing on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>He also made light of his sit­u­a­tion in an on­line ex­change with his daugh­ter, tele­vi­sion host Sandy Wu.</p>
    <p>Jacky Wu as­sured his daugh­ter that he was fine, jok­ing that he has turned into Wolver­ine, the su­per­hero with en­hanced heal­ing abil­i­ties, and cross­ing his arms like the char­ac­ter played by Hugh Jack­man in the X-Men movies.</p>
    <p>Mr Player is hosted by Wu and Kid Lin af­ter for­mer host Alien Huang died aged 36 in Septem­ber from car­dio­vas­cu­lar com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
