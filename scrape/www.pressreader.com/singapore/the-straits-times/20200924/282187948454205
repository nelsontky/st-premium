    <p>Can­cer runs in the fam­ily for nurse Ng Xin Hui, 34, who has lost her mother, brother and ma­ter­nal grand­fa­ther to the dreaded dis­ease.</p>
    <p>She was just seven years old when her mother died of colon can­cer at the age of 44.</p>
    <p>Her grand­fa­ther died a year later – also from the same can­cer.</p>
    <p>But the big­gest blow was the death of her brother, 33-year-old den­tist Ng Kun Liang, in 2010 of the same dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng nursed him dur­ing his fi­nal days, and his death spurred her to pur­sue a ca­reer in pal­lia­tive care, she said. One of her in­spi­ra­tions was the pal­lia­tive care team who had looked af­ter him.</p>
    <p>She said: “I was very im­pressed by how tact­fully they could dis­cuss the sub­ject of death and how they treated their pa­tient as a whole per­son, in­stead of some­one with a dis­ease to man­age.”</p>
    <p>She re­alised her own ex­pe­ri­ence put her in a place to help oth­ers in the same sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>As a pal­lia­tive care nurse at the National Can­cer Cen­tre Sin­ga­pore since Jan­uary, Ms Ng not only pro­vides nurs­ing care but also fa­cil­i­tates con­ver­sa­tions be­tween pa­tients and their fam­i­lies on end-oflife is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng is the youngest of three chil­dren, and has an elder sis­ter who is a so­cial worker.</p>
    <p>Her memories of her late mother, a teacher, are hazy, but she re­mem­bers clearly her anx­i­ety and fear of los­ing other loved ones af­ter her mother died.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng said: “I couldn’t sleep un­til my dad came home. Look­ing back, I was a bit wary that things could hap­pen and some­one might not be around.”</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther, who is now re­tired, re­mar­ried a few years later, and her step­mother treated the chil­dren like they were her own.</p>
    <p>As Ms Ng had been a child when her mother died, her first real strug­gle with loss came when she was 17, with the sud­den deaths of two cousins in a car crash.</p>
    <p>Then at Nanyang Polytech­nic study­ing for a di­ploma in nurs­ing, Ms Ng felt the pain of not get­ting to say good­bye.</p>
    <p>“All the deaths taught me the im­por­tance of hav­ing clo­sure. Like if you were di­ag­nosed with a ter­mi­nal ill­ness, you have time to say your last good­byes or to give your thanks. But there is no clo­sure for sud­den death,” she said.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily was to be tested again when her brother, then just 30, was di­ag­nosed with end-stage colon can­cer.</p>
    <p>She said: “Af­ter my mum died, my brother re­ally took on the role of a big brother. He doted on me. He was very charis­matic and ev­ery­one was drawn to him.”</p>
    <p>At the time, Ms Ng was study­ing for a nurs­ing de­gree at the Univer­sity of Syd­ney. Her brother kept the sever­ity of his ill­ness from the fam­ily as long as he could.</p>
    <p>He would give vague an­swers when she asked about the tu­mours. He also “seemed all right” out­wardly, and he con­tin­ued to work and keep to his usual rou­tine.</p>
    <p>She said: “Maybe we were in de­nial and so we didn’t probe too much.”</p>
    <p>He lived for three years af­ter his di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>It was only when his health started de­te­ri­o­rat­ing rapidly in the last few months of his life that the grim re­al­ity sank in.</p>
    <p>He be­came gaunt and breath­less, was in pain and fre­quently needed help to have the flu­ids drained from his ab­domen.</p>
    <p>In his last days, Ms Ng would rush home af­ter work to care for him.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter my brother’s death, I felt I could un­der­stand care­givers bet­ter. So I al­ways tell my pa­tients’ care­givers about the im­por­tance of tak­ing care of them­selves, and of rest,” she said, adding that her</p>
    <p>Christian faith has also helped her to cope with her grief.</p>
    <p>Her last in­ter­ac­tion with her brother haunted her for a long time.</p>
    <p>On the day he died, she was rush­ing to go to work in the morning when he asked her to drain the flu­ids from his ab­domen.</p>
    <p>She did as he asked, but her brother sensed her frus­tra­tion, and apol­o­gised. With tears in her eyes, she said: “I just felt re­ally bad that he had to apol­o­gise when he re­ally needed help.”</p>
    <p>He died that night af­ter she re­turned home from work.</p>
    <p>In her 14 years as a nurse, Ms Ng has seen more than her fair share of pain, suf­fer­ing and death. It still is never easy when pa­tients die.</p>
    <p>“I try to think pos­i­tively, like at least I had the chance to know this per­son and he or she does not have to suf­fer any longer,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I try to at­tend my pa­tients’ wakes as much as pos­si­ble. It is my form of clo­sure.”</p>
    <p>Ms An­gel Chen, 34, who is the sis­ter of Ms Ng’s hus­band and has known Ms Ng since they were in Se­condary 1, says it is in her na­ture to care. The of­fice man­ager said:</p>
    <p>“She’s very help­ful, very giv­ing and easy­go­ing as a per­son. She went to many of her pa­tients’ wakes although she didn’t need to, be­cause she gen­uinely cares for them.</p>
    <p>She added that Ms Ng re­cently vol­un­teered for nurs­ing du­ties for about one month at for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries at the height of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng is mar­ried to a chef and they have no chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Be­fore she got mar­ried, she told her fu­ture in-laws that she was at a higher risk of get­ting can­cer, given her fam­ily his­tory. Thank­fully, she said, they ac­cepted her.</p>
    <p>She has since tested neg­a­tive for the gene for an in­her­ited type of colon can­cer, which was a huge re­lief, but she is acutely aware that any­thing can hap­pen to any­one.</p>
    <p>But she does not dwell on thoughts of mor­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>She said: “Ev­ery­one goes through hard­ship and it is re­ally about ac­cept­ing sit­u­a­tions we have no con­trol over. Re­silience is be­ing able to ac­cept, adapt and to draw pos­i­tives out of hard­ship.”</p>
