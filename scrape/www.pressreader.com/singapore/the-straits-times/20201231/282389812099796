    <p>Un­able to set­tle his debts with an unlicensed money­len­der, an as­sis­tant man­ager with telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pany Sing­tel de­cided to help the loan shark by shar­ing with him the de­tails of six Sing­tel cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>A district court heard that Filipino Pleo Sher­win Cu­bos, 40, re­trieved the in­for­ma­tion for the loan shark, who is known only as Alan, de­spite know­ing that he was not sup­posed to do so.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Cu­bos, who is no longer work­ing for Sing­tel, pleaded guilty to one count each of as­sist­ing a loan shark and an un­re­lated crim­i­nal breach of trust charge.</p>
    <p>He was then sen­tenced to three months and three weeks’ jail and given a $30,000 fine. Should he be un­able to pay it, he will spend an ad­di­tional six weeks be­hind bars.</p>
    <p>Cu­bos earned a base pay of about $5,000 a month at his job and was in need of cash some time in late Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>He re­sponded to a Face­book advertisem­ent for loan fa­cil­i­ties to bor­row $500.</p>
    <p>He was then told to fork out $350 as in­ter­est per week un­til he was able to re­pay the prin­ci­pal sum of $500.</p>
    <p>Cu­bos started to take up more loans as he was un­able to set­tle his debt, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Deputy Public Pros­e­cu­tor Emily Koh said: “In the short span of two weeks, the ac­cused’s debts had snow­balled to about $3,000 across five dif­fer­ent unlicensed money­len­ders.</p>
    <p>“As the ac­cused was un­able to re­pay his debts, he be­gan to be ha­rassed by the unlicensed money­len­ders, which in­cluded footage of a house be­ing set on fire and an un­known in­di­vid­ual stand­ing out­side his apart­ment.”</p>
    <p>The loan shark called Alan later sent Cu­bos a list of iden­tity card num­bers as well as phone num­bers, as he knew the Filipino was work­ing for Sing­tel.</p>
    <p>Alan told Cu­bos that he would stop ha­rass­ing him if Cu­bos agreed to ac­cess Sing­tel’s in­ter­nal data sys­tem, known as CRM, to screen the num­bers and re­trieve de­tails such as cus­tomers’ ad­dresses.</p>
    <p>Cu­bos did as he was told and screened the records of 27 cus­tomers on CRM be­tween Feb 20 and April 25, even though he was not au­tho­rised to do so. He then sent the de­tails of six cus­tomers to Alan.</p>
    <p>In March and April, Cu­bos also pawned three of Sing­tel’s iPads worth nearly $2,000 in to­tal to ob­tain at least $250 in re­turn.</p>
    <p>He then used the money for his per­sonal ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Cu­bos’ su­per­vi­sor found out about his of­fences and alerted the police on May 2.</p>
