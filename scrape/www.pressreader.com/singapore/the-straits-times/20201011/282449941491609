    <p>A trav­eller’s great­est fear is prob­a­bly a med­i­cal emer­gency over­seas. Lost items and flight de­lays pale in com­par­i­son.</p>
    <p>A Covid-19-pos­i­tive di­ag­no­sis means quar­an­tine in an un­fa­mil­iar en­vi­ron­ment, lan­guage bar­ri­ers and dif­fer­ing med­i­cal stan­dards – a cock­tail of travel night­mares. Ex­pen­sive, too.</p>
    <p>Air­lines, travel agents and in­sur­ers are scram­bling to mit­i­gate costs for the trav­eller. Covid-19 cov­ers, for ex­am­ple, are tagged to air tick­ets or the stan­dard travel in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>Here is a run­down of some Covid-19 cov­er­age and the trip­wires to be mind­ful of.</p>
    <p>TRAVEL AD­VI­SORY V TRAVEL BAN</p>
    <p>Think of “travel ad­vi­sory” as the mother of all travel catch­phrases dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Travel ad­vi­sories are is­sued by the coun­tries of de­par­ture – for de­part­ing trav­ellers. In Sin­ga­pore, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) is­sues the ad­vi­sories.</p>
    <p>Travel bans, how­ever, are usu­ally en­try and bor­der con­trols im­posed by a des­ti­na­tion against for­eign trav­ellers.</p>
    <p>“Travel ad­vi­sories and travel bans are not wed­ded in bliss,” a lo­cal un­der­writer notes. In­sur­ers, he ad­mits, com­pli­cate mat­ters with their own list of coun­tries deemed out of bounds.</p>
    <p>Some coun­tries like Bri­tain and the United States wel­come Sin­ga­pore pass­ports, but lo­cal au­thor­i­ties do not en­dorse gen­eral leisure travel there.</p>
    <p>Con­versely, Sin­ga­pore’s au­thor­i­ties may en­dorse travel to cer­tain des­ti­na­tions, for in­stance, Aus­tralia and New Zealand, but this is not re­cip­ro­cated.</p>
    <p>In its lat­est travel up­date on Oct 1, MOH en­dorsed gen­eral travel to only four coun­tries – New Zealand, Aus­tralia, Viet­nam and Brunei – out of 193 United Na­tions mem­bers.</p>
    <p>For of­fi­cial and busi­ness travel un­der its Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane and bi­lat­eral ar­range­ments, there are China, Malaysia, South Korea and Ja­pan. (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19).</p>
    <p>Be­sides leisure and es­sen­tial travel, stu­dent travel that meets re­quire­ments is also en­dorsed.</p>
    <p>Be­yond these eight coun­tries and con­di­tions, all other trav­els are against MOH travel ad­vi­sories. And they are not cov­ered by Covid-19 in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>AIR­LINES’ COVID-19 COVER IN LOCK­STEP WITH</p>
    <p>TRAVEL AD­VI­SORIES</p>
    <p>From mid-Au­gust, na­tional car­rier</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA), through un­der­writer AIG, of­fered Covid-19 cover pro­tec­tion as part of a stan­dard travel in­sur­ance plan.</p>
    <p>Pas­sen­gers who pur­chase roundtrip tick­ets are cov­ered for pre­de­par­ture trip can­cel­la­tions; trip cur­tail­ment losses; Covid-19 re­lated over­seas med­i­cal ex­penses; repa­tri­a­tion and quar­an­tine al­lowance ex­penses over­seas (str.sg/J2WY).</p>
    <p>Lim­ited to Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents fly­ing with SIA and SilkAir, the travel in­sur­ance starts at $34 for a three-day Asean cov­er­age and goes up to a stag­ger­ing $1,757 for a 180-day world­wide cover.</p>
    <p>Its sub­sidiary, Scoot, has also teamed up with in­surer AXA to pro­vide a more mod­est Covid-19 cover (str.sg/J2Wg).</p>
    <p>How­ever, these sup­ple­ments ap­ply only to MOH’s ap­proved travel des­ti­na­tions or es­sen­tial travel.</p>
    <p>EMI­RATES COVID-19 COVER: THE GOLD STAN­DARD</p>
    <p>In July, Mid­dle East­ern air­line Emi­rates, with in­surer Al­lianz NEXtCARE, launched the world’s first stand­alone Covid-19 cover. Deemed the gold stan­dard, it comes with two out­stand­ing fea­tures. First, it is a four-let­ter word: free. Sec­ond, it cov­ers against travel ad­vi­sories – ex­cept un­der an out­right travel ban (str.sg/J2WM).</p>
    <p>Also, on­ward des­ti­na­tions are cov­ered, for up to 31 days. The cover stops when the pas­sen­ger re­turns to the home base, which­ever is ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The scheme proved so pop­u­lar that it is now ex­tended un­til the end of De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>In early Septem­ber, Eti­had Air­ways jumped on the band­wagon with its Travel Cover, which is un­der­writ­ten by AXA Gulf. The cover is sim­i­lar to the Emi­rates scheme.</p>
    <p>OVER­SEAS-IS­SUED MED­I­CAL COVID-19 COVER</p>
    <p>Can peo­ple buy cover against travel ad­vi­sories?</p>
    <p>Is­suers in the US and Europe un­der­write travel in­sur­ance, with Covid-19 cover, for over­seas trav­ellers headed to se­lected des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>They have dif­fer­ent ex­clu­sions and may dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween trip in­sur­ance and med­i­cal in­sur­ance. Com­pre­hen­sive plans are also avail­able (str.sg/J2WA).</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, global travel un­der­writer IMG-Sir­ius In­ter­na­tional’s CoverAmer­ica Gold pro­vides cov­er­age for non-US res­i­dents/cit­i­zens trav­el­ling to the US plus Canada, Mex­ico, Latin Amer­ica, the Ba­hamas and South Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>For a 30-day cov­er­age, the in­sured per­son re­ceives com­pre­hen­sive travel in­sur­ance with Covid-19 screen­ing ben­e­fit and quar­an­tine cover. Its US$250,000 (S$339,000) pol­icy limit plan costs US$216.</p>
    <p>But there are caveats such as de­ductibles; vary­ing lev­els of re­im­burse­ments; and ex­clu­sions due to US sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>Over­seas ad­min­is­tra­tors and un­der­writ­ers may be more reg­i­mented. It is ad­min­is­tra­tively more cum­ber­some to file a claim against a for­eign un­der­writer, in a dif­fer­ent time zone.</p>
    <p>I cringe when I re­call a pre­vi­ous claim with a ma­jor US in­surer.</p>
    <p>Due to bad weather, a high­alti­tude Cen­tral Asia flight was can­celled.</p>
    <p>With the air­port shut down in­def­i­nitely, the air­line ad­vised me to make an over­land trip in­stead, since the spotty weather might con­tinue for the next two to three days.</p>
    <p>I took a haz­ardous 16-hour pri­vate car hire over moun­tain­ous gravel roads. Yet, the US in­surer re­jected my claim and said I should have waited for the weather to clear.</p>
    <p>Af­ter three months, a dozen emails and many phone calls, cul­mi­nat­ing in an es­ca­la­tion of my case to its se­nior man­age­ment, my claim was ap­proved.</p>
    <p>It was a good out­come, but what a frus­trat­ing ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Thus, I would still pre­fer to buy cover through a Sin­ga­pore ad­min­is­tra­tor.</p>
    <p>“An in­sur­ance cover is only good if a valid claim is fairly re­im­bursed ex­pe­di­tiously,” ad­vises an in­surer con­tact who de­clines to be named.</p>
    <p>TRAVEL AGENTS’ COVID-19 COVER</p>
    <p>The Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Travel Agents Sin­ga­pore (Natas), in con­junc­tion with May­bank’s Etiqa, is work­ing out a Covid-19 spe­cific travel cover.</p>
    <p>It cov­ers travel post­pone­ment, med­i­cal ex­penses and hos­pi­tal al­lowances.</p>
    <p>A stand­out is post-trip med­i­cal ex­penses in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>An Etiqa spokesman says the plan, once fi­nalised, will be made avail­able through Natas’ agents.</p>
    <p>Sadly, but un­der­stand­ably, the plan will ad­here to MOH’s travel ad­vi­sories and their lim­i­ta­tions. Yet, it would serve those leisure and busi­ness trav­ellers who are jour­ney­ing in com­pli­ance with the ad­vi­sories.</p>
    <p>END OF COVID-19 COVER AND STAY-HOME NO­TICES</p>
    <p>Covid-19 cover ends when peo­ple get home. There is no post-trip cover avail­able cur­rently.</p>
    <p>Even the plans that are ad­min­is­tered over­seas stop short of a post­trip cover.</p>
    <p>So, Covid-19 swab tests, stay­home no­tices or quar­an­tine ex­penses at des­ig­nated fa­cil­i­ties are out-of-pocket ex­penses.</p>
    <p>More­over, trav­ellers who ven­ture out de­spite MOH’s ad­vi­sories – and test pos­i­tive within 14 days of their re­turn – will not re­ceive any govern­ment sub­si­dies or med­i­cal ben­e­fits for their treat­ment.</p>
    <p>It is a sober­ing thought – as that could eas­ily add a few thou­sand dol­lars of ex­penses to the trip.</p>
    <p>TRAVEL IN­SUR­ANCE AS A NEW NOR­MAL</p>
    <p>Pan­demic cov­ers may emerge as a new nor­mal.</p>
    <p>The world with closed bor­ders, on an ex­tended ba­sis, is not the new nor­mal. But cer­tainly, a cav­a­lier at­ti­tude in travel re­mains out of lim­its.</p>
    <p>Un­der nor­mal cir­cum­stances, peo­ple choose car­ri­ers based on per­sonal pref­er­ences such as flight sched­ule, bud­get, loy­alty pro­gramme and ser­vice qual­ity, among other fac­tors.</p>
    <p>But if I re­ally need to travel be­yond MOH’s en­dorsed list of des­ti­na­tions, I would give se­ri­ous thought to fly­ing Emi­rates – its less re­stric­tive Covid-19 cover is as­sur­ing and mean­ing­ful.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple may baulk at ex­ist­ing Covid-19 cov­ers with their weak in­clu­sions and nu­mer­ous ex­clu­sions. Yet, how­ever lim­ited they may be, it beats zero cover for any trav­eller.</p>
    <p>I would not leave home with­out it – just be mind­ful of the fine print.</p>
