    <p>As part of its re­view process, the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity looks at data from pre-clin­i­cal stud­ies in lab­o­ra­to­ries, clin­i­cal tri­als on hu­man vol­un­teers, man­u­fac­tur­ing and qual­ity con­trols, as well as coun­tries’ on­go­ing ex­pe­ri­ence with the ac­tual use of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The Pfizer-BioN­Tech vac­cine un­der­went this process be­fore be­ing au­tho­rised for use, while the Moderna and Si­no­vac vac­cines are cur­rently be­ing re­viewed.</p>
    <p>Safety must be en­sured for peo­ple re­ceiv­ing the Covid-19 vac­cine, and that will in­clude hav­ing a proper queue­ing and reg­is­tra­tion sys­tem, and en­sur­ing their data is cap­tured ac­cu­rately, all of which has a bear­ing on how quickly vac­ci­na­tions can be rolled out, Par­lia­ment heard yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“So it is quite a com­plex sit­u­a­tion,” said Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong in re­sponse to Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sem­bawang GRC), who had ex­pressed his view that the na­tion­wide vac­ci­na­tion ef­fort should be rolled out more quickly.</p>
    <p>In his min­is­te­rial state­ment on Sin­ga­pore’s re­sponse to the pan­demic, Mr Gan ac­knowl­edged that many ques­tions have been raised on vac­cine safety and ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>“These con­cerns are un­der­stand­able, given the ex­tra­or­di­nary speed at which the Covid-19 vac­cines have been de­vel­oped and brought to mar­ket,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Let me as­sure you that the safety and well-be­ing of Sin­ga­pore­ans is top pri­or­ity in our vac­ci­na­tion ef­forts.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas), who had asked if there is any data to show that ex­ist­ing vac­cines are ef­fec­tive against the new, more trans­mis­si­ble strain of the coro­n­avirus from Bri­tain, Mr Gan added that there is cur­rently no ev­i­dence that shows they are not.</p>
    <p>Vac­cine man­u­fac­tur­ers Pfiz­erBioNTech and Moderna have pub­licly stated that their vac­cines are likely to pro­tect against the new strain, and are un­der­tak­ing stud­ies to for­mally con­firm this.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) will eval­u­ate the data as it emerges and re­view Sin­ga­pore’s vac­cine strat­egy and bor­der mea­sures ac­cord­ingly, Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>“Mu­ta­tions oc­cur in viruses nat­u­rally and dif­fer­ent strains can emerge from time to time, es­pe­cially in a long-drawn pan­demic,” he said. “Ex­perts have said that it is un­likely that these mu­ta­tions would im­pact ef­fec­tive­ness of cur­rent vac­cines.”</p>
    <p>The Health Min­is­ter also de­tailed the rig­or­ous re­view process that Covid-19 vac­cines have to un­dergo be­fore be­ing ap­proved for use here.</p>
    <p>First, they are stud­ied by ex­perts from the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity (HSA) un­der the Pan­demic Spe­cial Ac­cess Route. The vac­cines are held up against strict in­ter­na­tional stan­dards of qual­ity, safety and ef­fi­cacy.</p>
    <p>These stan­dards are the same as those used for full vac­cine eval­u­a­tions, ex­cept that longer-term data from clin­i­cal tri­als will be eval­u­ated only later, as more data be­comes avail­able.</p>
    <p>As part of its re­view process, the HSA looks at data from pre-clin­i­cal stud­ies in lab­o­ra­to­ries, clin­i­cal tri­als on hu­man vol­un­teers, man­u­fac­tur­ing and qual­ity con­trols, as well as coun­tries’ on­go­ing ex­pe­ri­ence with the ac­tual use of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The Pfizer-BioN­Tech vac­cine un­der­went this process be­fore be­ing au­tho­rised for use, while the Moderna and Si­no­vac vac­cines are cur­rently be­ing re­viewed.</p>
    <p>“HSA will al­low a Covid-19 vac­cine to be used only if it is as­sessed to be suf­fi­ciently ef­fi­ca­cious and safe for use, and only if the ben­e­fits of the vac­cine are as­sessed to out­weigh the risks of any po­ten­tial ad­verse ef­fects from the vac­ci­na­tion,” Mr Gan said.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing HSA’s ap­proval, the in­de­pen­dent ex­pert com­mit­tee ap­pointed by MOH also re­viewed clin­i­cal data on the safety and ef­fi­cacy of the Pfizer-BioN­Tech vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“In as­sess­ing the suit­abil­ity of vac­cine can­di­dates for spe­cific pop­u­la­tion groups, the ex­pert com­mit­tee took into con­sid­er­a­tion four key cri­te­ria – vac­cine safety, vac­cine ef­fi­cacy, vac­cine tol­er­a­bil­ity, and data ad­e­quacy of clin­i­cal tri­als,” Mr Gan added.</p>
