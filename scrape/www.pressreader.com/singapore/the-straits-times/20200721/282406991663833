    <p>NEW YORK • Test­ing the no­tion that blue-chip art can be sold with a swipe, for­mer Christie’s ex­ec­u­tive Loic Gouzer yes­ter­day used his new app as the auc­tion block for a large drawing by Jean-Michel Basquiat that is es­ti­mated to sell for US$8 mil­lion (S$11.1 mil­lion) to US$9 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The app, called Fair Warn­ing, started as a lark, Mr Gouzer said, a way to keep busy un­der lock­down and to see whether the art world could pivot to on­line sales in a mean­ing­ful way.</p>
    <p>The first piece he auc­tioned on the app, Steven Shearer’s 2018 por­trait Syn­thist, sold to a pri­vate Euro­pean col­lec­tor for US$437,000 – an auc­tion high for the artist – on an es­ti­mate of US$180,000 to US$250,000.</p>
    <p>Mr Gouzer said he has since sold two works: a body print by David Ham­mons, for about US$1.3 mil­lion (es­ti­mated at US$500,000 to</p>
    <p>US$700,000), and a piece by Steven Par­rino, for US$977,500 (es­ti­mated at US$650,000 to US$750,000).</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally an ex­per­i­ment,” said Mr Gouzer, who while at Christie’s built a rep­u­ta­tion as a bad-boy rain­maker for com­ing up with un­ortho­dox sale ideas as well as procur­ing and po­si­tion­ing big-ticket art­works, most fa­mously Leonardo da Vinci’s Sal­va­tor Mundi for</p>
    <p>US$450.3 mil­lion in 2017.</p>
    <p>“The idea was to cre­ate a guer­rilla type of auc­tion sys­tem,” he said, “where you could start mov­ing paint­ings by us­ing the cloud rather than phys­i­cal lo­ca­tions.”</p>
    <p>So far, the large auc­tion houses seem un­con­cerned about him tak­ing a sig­nif­i­cant piece of their busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“The avail­abil­ity of only a sin­gle lot is a con­struct eas­ily repli­cated,” said Mr Marc Porter, chair­man of Christie’s Amer­i­cas, who called the app “clever and in­ven­tive”.</p>
    <p>“The key fac­tor will be t he breadth of au­di­ence,” Mr Porter added. “In that, he must con­tend with the world­wide data that the large auc­tion houses, art fairs and mega deal­ers have been in­vest­ing in for years.”</p>
    <p>Buy­ers must ap­ply for ad­mis­sion to the app, where they are eval­u­ated for the se­ri­ous­ness of their col­lect­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Gouzer is try­ing to keep out spec­u­la­tors who would flip the works for higher prices to make a quick profit. He had hoped to avoid guar­an­tees – lin­ing up a min­i­mum bid in ad­vance – which have be­come rou­tine among auc­tion houses. But he said sell­ers de­mand them th­ese days. The Basquiat is guar­an­teed for an undis­closed amount around the low es­ti­mate, he added.</p>
    <p>The un­ti­tled Basquiat, an acrylic and oil stick on black pa­per that mea­sures about 1.2m by 1.8m, fea­tures many of the qual­i­ties the artist was best known for, such as “all the ob­ses­sive scrib­bling and those words that come all the time, like ‘tar’ and ‘as­bestos’”, Mr Gouzer said.</p>
    <p>He trans­formed his garage in Mon­tauk, New York, into a cli­mate-con­trolled view­ing room where in­ter­ested buy­ers can view the Basquiat start­ing Thurs­day. He hired se­cu­rity to guard it. The piece will sell on July 30.</p>
    <p>The Stay-Home Guide, made up of 5 Things To Do To­day, Com­fort Cook­ing and 30 Days Of Art With NAC, which runs in the week­day edi­tions of the Life sec­tion, has come to an end.</p>
