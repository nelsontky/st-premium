    <p>•</p>
    <p>Four­teen years af­ter tele­vi­sion po­lit­i­cal drama The West Wing shut down its White House set, the show is back with its ide­alised ver­sion of a United States pres­i­dent and a mis­sion to get Amer­i­cans to the polls on Nov 3 to choose a real one.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can ac­tor Martin Sheen – who played the lib­eral-lean­ing US Pres­i­dent Jed Bart­let on the show – re­unites with fic­tional White House staffers por­trayed by Bradley Whit­ford, Al­li­son Jan­ney, Rob Lowe, Dule Hill, Janel Mal­oney and Richard Schiff for a one-off spe­cial to pro­mote vot­ing.</p>
    <p>A West Wing Spe­cial To Ben­e­fit When We All Vote, to be broad­cast on HBO Max to­day, is a staged the­atri­cal per­for­mance of an episode from 2002, called Harts­field’s Land­ing, in which the cerebral Bart­let plays chess with his aides while await­ing the re­sults of a state pri­mary election and deal­ing with a brew­ing cri­sis over Taiwan.</p>
    <p>West Wing cre­ator Aaron Sorkin said it was cho­sen “be­cause the episode ended with a feel­ing that we wanted the au­di­ence to have. A feel­ing about vot­ing”.</p>
    <p>While Sorkin wrote no up­dates to the script, the likes of former US Pres­i­dent Bill Clin­ton, former US first l ady Michelle Obama and Hamil­ton mu­si­cal cre­ator LinManuel Miranda will ap­pear dur­ing com­mer­cial breaks “giv­ing in­for­ma­tion about vot­ing, knock­ing down some un­truths about vot­ing, and do­ing it in their own style”, Sorkin said.</p>
    <p>Sorkin said he was a firm believer in the in­flu­en­tial power of movies and tele­vi­sion in shap­ing ideas, but said The West Wing would be no dif­fer­ent if he was writ­ing it i n to­day’s po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“What the show was al­ways about was a work­place drama set in a very in­ter­est­ing work­place,” Sorkin said.</p>
    <p>“In our pop­u­lar cul­ture, our elected lead­ers are por­trayed ei­ther as Machi­avel­lian or as dolts. So I thought, what if there is a show where these peo­ple are ev­ery bit as con­fi­dent and ded­i­cated as doc­tors and nurses on a hospi­tal show or the lawyers on a le­gal drama.”</p>
    <p>The West Wing ended its sev­enyear run in 2006 af­ter win­ning more than 20 Emmy Awards. The spe­cial was shot as a play in an empty the­atre in Los An­ge­les un­der coro­n­avirus guide­lines.</p>
    <p>This Is Us star Ster­ling K. Brown takes the role of chief of staff Leo McGarry fol­low­ing the death in 2005 of ac­tor John Spencer.</p>
    <p>“It was mov­ing to have ev­ery­body back to­gether,” said direc­tor Thomas Sch­lamme.</p>
    <p>“What was stun­ning to me was how quickly these ac­tors slipped right back into their char­ac­ters.”</p>
