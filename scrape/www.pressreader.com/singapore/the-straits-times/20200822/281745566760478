    <p>Constructi­on works have re­sumed at 89 Build-To-Or­der (BTO) sites as of Mon­day, Min­is­ter for National De­vel­op­ment Des­mond Lee said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Only one of the 90 BTO sites is cur­rently pend­ing ap­proval from the Build­ing and Constructi­on Au­thor­ity (BCA), but the Hous­ing Board told The Straits Times that it is work­ing with the con­trac­tor to safely re­sume works.</p>
    <p>The HDB did not spec­ify the site. Constructi­on works have re­sumed grad­u­ally since June 2, when the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures were eased, with com­pa­nies hav­ing to ad­here to strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures on work­sites amid the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>The HDB had said pre­vi­ously that some BTO projects will be de­layed by about six to nine months be­yond their orig­i­nal es­ti­mated com­ple­tion dates be­cause of ma­te­rial sup­ply dis­rup­tions and man­power short­ages.</p>
    <p>There is no change to the es­ti­mated de­lay time­line, although the HDB will con­tinue to look for ways to re­duce the length of de­lays as works re­sume, the Min­istry of National De­vel­op­ment (MND) and HDB said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among the 89 BTO sites where constructi­on works have restarted is the Senja Val­ley project in Bukit Pan­jang, which was launched in May 2016.</p>
    <p>It con­sists of 789 units of tworoom flexi, three-room, four-room and five-room flats, and 202 pub­lic ren­tal flats.</p>
    <p>Sim Lian Constructi­on, the main con­trac­tor for the project, ob­tained BCA’s ap­proval on July 4, and constructi­on works have re­sumed pro­gres­sively since July 17.</p>
    <p>Sim Lian’s project di­rec­tor Phay Mor­gan, 49, who over­sees the project, said Senja Val­ley was orig­i­nally four months ahead of sched­ule be­fore the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod kicked in on April 7.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quent de­lays meant that the home owners would no longer be able to get their keys ear­lier than was orig­i­nally an­tic­i­pated. In­stead, it is on track for its orig­i­nal es­ti­mated com­ple­tion date in the fourth quar­ter of next year.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, about 220 work­ers – around 80 per cent of the work­force re­quired – are back on the project site.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Lee vis­ited the Senja Val­ley site to ob­serve some of the safety mea­sures im­ple­mented to pre­vent a resur­gence of Covid-19 cases on constructi­on sites.</p>
    <p>These in­clude the de­mar­ca­tion of zones within the site with ded­i­cated rest ar­eas and toi­let fa­cil­i­ties, and seg­re­gated work teams with stag­gered eat­ing, rest­ing and re­port­ing times.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post later, Mr Lee thanked con­trac­tors for putting in the ex­tra ef­fort to con­sult the rel­e­vant agen­cies reg­u­larly, and to en­sure de­tailed man­power plan­ning and site prepa­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Abid­ing by these safety mea­sures may lead to in­evitable de­lays, but they are needed for ev­ery­one’s health and safety,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I would like to re­as­sure home owners that HDB will con­tinue to do its best to min­imise these de­lays for all other BTO projects, while work­ing with con­trac­tors to en­sure Covid-safe com­pli­ance.”</p>
    <p>The HDB said flat buy­ers will be kept up­dated on the com­ple­tion date of their BTO project through let­ters and via their My HDBPage ac­count, as constructi­on pro­gresses.</p>
    <p>EN­SUR­ING SAFETY</p>
    <p>Abid­ing by these safety mea­sures may lead to in­evitable de­lays, but they are needed for ev­ery­one’s health and safety... I would like to re­as­sure home owners that</p>
    <p>HDB will con­tinue to do its best to min­imise these de­lays for all other BTO projects, while work­ing with con­trac­tors to en­sure Covid-safe com­pli­ance.</p>

    <p>MIN­IS­TER FOR NATIONAL DE­VEL­OP­MENT DES­MOND LEE, on the de­lays caused by the ad­di­tional safety mea­sures that had to be im­ple­mented on the var­i­ous BTO work­sites.</p>
