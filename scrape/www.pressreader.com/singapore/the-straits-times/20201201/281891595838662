    <p>Last week’s as­sas­si­na­tion of Dr Mohsen Fakhrizade­h, Iran’s top nu­clear sci­en­tist, ap­pears to be one cal­cu­lated to send many mes­sages, not least of which is that Is­rael – ac­cused of mas­ter­mind­ing the at­tack – has not only the means but also the diplo­matic cover for such op­er­a­tions. Dr Fakhrizade­h was killed last Fri­day in a fire­fight out­side the cap­i­tal Teheran de­spite the high level of se­cu­rity ac­corded him. The Ira­nian gov­ern­ment has fin­gered Is­rael for the mur­der and has vowed re­tal­i­a­tion. Dr Fakhrizade­h’s body was taken to var­i­ous sites holy to Ira­nian Mus­lims be­fore be­ing buried yes­ter­day in the pres­ence of his fam­ily and se­nior mil­i­tary com­man­ders.</p>
    <p>What now? Mr Ali Ak­bar Ve­lay­ati, in­ter­na­tional af­fairs ad­viser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ay­a­tol­lah Ali Khamenei, made clear that Iran “will avenge the blood of this great mar­tyr from the ter­ror­ist el­e­ments and their sup­port­ers”. The chief of staff of the Ira­nian Armed Forces, Ma­jor-Gen­eral Mo­ham­mad Bagheri, also warned of “se­vere re­venge”. There are calls within Iran for the coun­try to leave the nu­clear non-pro­lif­er­a­tion treaty and for it to now ban in­ter­na­tional in­spec­tions of its nu­clear fa­cil­i­ties. Kay­han, a hard­line Ira­nian daily, wants to see strikes against Is­rael.</p>
    <p>This would be alarm­ing for one and all. Even the United Arab Emi­rates, which is no friend of Iran, called the killing a “heinous as­sas­si­na­tion” which could fur­ther fuel con­flict in the re­gion. Whether ac­cu­rate or not, the killing will be linked to the United States, where Mr Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, which some be­lieve to be work­ing in tan­dem with Is­rael, is in its last weeks. Mr Antony Blinken, Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s sec­re­tary of state nom­i­nee, was the key fig­ure in the Barack Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion who bro­kered the mul­ti­lat­eral nu­clear pact with Iran from which Mr Trump with­drew the US in 2018. In Jan­uary, a US strike killed the head of Iran’s clan­des­tine over­seas mil­i­tary and in­tel­li­gence op­er­a­tions Qasem Soleimani.</p>
    <p>De­spite such de­vel­op­ments, Iran would be well-ad­vised to show strate­gic pa­tience and wait un­til the new US ad­min­is­tra­tion takes charge on Jan 20. Mr Bi­den sig­nalled he may be pre­pared to re­join the nu­clear ac­cord that Mr Trump ditched, and it is in Teheran’s in­ter­ests to hold off on any ac­tion that would make it harder for him to do so. In any case, Mr Bi­den is un­likely to look kindly on the mur­der, if in­deed it was car­ried out by Is­rael, be­cause it could have been aimed at trip­ping him up on Iran pol­icy just weeks be­fore he takes of­fice. Coun­tries with in­flu­ence in Iran – no­tably China and Rus­sia – would also find it in their in­ter­ests to coun­sel re­straint. They have as much to gain as Iran in re­set­ting ties with the US.</p>
