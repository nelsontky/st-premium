    <p>In any other year, a Tai­wanese film­goer would rather opt for a Hol­ly­wood block­buster over a lo­cally pro­duced film. But with Covid-19 rav­aging coun­tries world­wide, last year was dif­fer­ent. Film lovers around the world were no longer spoilt for choice.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion of many Hol­ly­wood films halted be­tween March and August. Movies that pre­miered last year grossed only about 10 per cent of 2019’s box of­fice numbers, ac­cord­ing to film data­base IMDb.</p>
    <p>But in Tai­wan, where the coro­n­avirus out­break had been suc­cess­fully han­dled, film di­rec­tors and pro­duc­tion com­pa­nies took the op­por­tu­nity to step up their game, with the govern­ment en­cour­ag­ing lo­cal film-mak­ers to un­leash their cre­ativ­ity.</p>
    <p>In part­ner­ship with the Min­istry of Cul­ture, cin­ema own­ers and pro­duc­tion teams last July an­nounced a project ti­tled Lo­cal Films Tak­ing Off. Un­der the aus­pices of this pro­gramme, four to five Tai­wanese films will hit the big screens ev­ery month un­til April this year.</p>
    <p>To boost ticket sales, or­gan­is­ers cre­ated a re­wards sys­tem of­fer­ing gifts for movies watched. Movie­go­ers were asked to send pho­tos of their film tick­ets.</p>
    <p>“I went to see 10 Tai­wanese movies... and got two glasses de­signed to cel­e­brate lo­cal films,” said Ms Lin Li-wen, 31, a teacher from Tainan.</p>
    <p>While cin­e­mas in Tai­wan were badly hit when the pan­demic first hit early last year, things improved when the govern­ment grad­u­ally lifted curbs. In May, up to 100 peo­ple were al­lowed to share the same space in­doors; a month later, so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures for movie­go­ers were en­tirely lifted – they needed only to don face masks and have their tem­per­a­tures taken upon en­ter­ing the cin­e­mas.</p>
    <p>The first film to shake up the box of­fice in Tai­wan was the se­quel to South Korea thriller Train To Bu­san which pre­miered on the is­land in July. But the ar­rival of more Tai­wanese films around that time also boosted ticket sales.</p>
    <p>“(Tai­wanese films are do­ing bet­ter since) Hol­ly­wood and other for­eign films were af­fected by Covid-19. But many lo­cal films from di­verse gen­res also pre­miered in the se­cond half of last year, giv­ing movie­go­ers more op­tions than be­fore,” movie di­rec­tor Joseph Hsu Chen-Chieh told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Mr Hsu di­rected Lit­tle Big Women – a film about women in a three-gen­er­a­tion Tai­wanese fam­ily – which won Best Actress at the Golden Horse Awards in Novem­ber. The Golden Horse Awards are viewed as the “Chi­nese-lan­guage Os­cars”.</p>
    <p>“What stood out last year is that about half of the di­rec­tors whose films made it to the cin­e­mas are new­com­ers. They pre­sented films with themes cen­tred on so­cial is­sues, dis­ad­van­taged groups, fe­male roles in the fam­ily,” said Mr Hsu, prais­ing di­rec­tors for tak­ing a dif­fer­ent path from the ma­jor­ity of Tai­wanese films that of­ten re­volve around high school stu­dents or are hor­ror movies.</p>
    <p>Prior to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, lo­cal films ac­counted for less than 10 per cent of films’ gross earn­ings in Tai­wan each year.</p>
    <p>For­mer cul­ture min­is­ter Cheng Li-chun, who stepped down last year, had vowed to raise the num­ber of lo­cal films re­leased an­nu­ally un­til they ac­counted for at least 20 per cent of the box of­fice earn­ings.</p>
    <p>Her quest may soon be re­alised. In 2019, Tai­wanese f i l ms grossed only 8.2 per cent of what all the films that pre­miered earned, but last year, the num­ber rose to nearly 18 per cent as at the end of Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Un­de­terred by the coro­n­avirus, Tai­wan also con­tin­ued to hold a string of an­nual film fes­ti­vals, in­clud­ing the Taipei Film Fes­ti­val, with its 22-year-old his­tory, and the Golden Horse Film Fes­ti­val that ended with the Golden Horse Awards.</p>
    <p>“(Hav­ing) ac­tual film fes­ti­vals last year as op­posed to vir­tual ones also helped in terms of pro­mot­ing Tai­wanese films to the public,” said Tai­wanese-Amer­i­can film-maker Yi Liu.</p>
    <p>He is now di­rect­ing De­ten­tion (2020 TV se­ries), a Tai­wanese video-game-turned-film-turnedNet­flix-se­ries.</p>
    <p>The film ver­sion of the thriller won the grand prize in the 2020 Taipei Film Fes­ti­val, the first film event held in a phys­i­cal venue and to ad­mit film­go­ers since the start of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the Golden Horse Awards, Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen posted a “Tai­wanese film bingo” on her so­cial me­dia ac­counts, not­ing that de­spite Covid-19, film work­ers’ pas­sion to cre­ate has not been di­min­ished.</p>
