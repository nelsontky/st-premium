    <p>What is your se­cret to look­ing fab­u­lous?</p>
    <p>Be­ing dis­ci­plined with my diet and ex­er­cise reg­i­men.</p>
    <p>Has there ever been a time when you were not fit and fab?</p>
    <p>Dur­ing my teenage years, when my only form of ex­er­cise was co-cur­ric­u­lar ac­tiv­ity (CCA) train­ing for bad­minton.</p>
    <p>What is your diet like?</p>
    <p>I have been do­ing i nter­mit­tent fast­ing for the past few years, in which I fast on week­days between 8pm and 2pm the next day.</p>
    <p>Apart from that, I pretty much eat what­ever I want.</p>
    <p>What are your in­dul­gences?</p>
    <p>Who does not like good fried chicken, Neapoli­tan piz­zas and mum’s cook­ing? Oth­er­wise, any other car­bo­hy­drates are wel­come.</p>
    <p>How do you main­tain a healthy work-life bal­ance?</p>
    <p>I ei­ther wake up early to ex­er­cise or make sure I go for my run straight af­ter work if I have had late-night calls the night be­fore.</p>
    <p>What are the three most im­por­tant things in your life?</p>
    <p>God, fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>What is your favourite and least favourite part of your body?</p>
    <p>I am happy with what I have.</p>
    <p>What are your must-dos be­fore and af­ter a work­out?</p>
    <p>I do not have a strict “be­fore” and “af­ter” ex­er­cise rou­tine, which is prob­a­bly not ideal.</p>
    <p>But I try to go for a deep-tis­sue mas­sage ev­ery one to two months to loosen up the mus­cles and get rid of the knots.</p>
    <p>How im­por­tant is it for you to keep up with your fitness rou­tine?</p>
    <p>More of­ten than not, I try to keep up with my rou­tine. With ev­ery birth­day that passes, your metabolism de­creases and your fitness and diet rou­tines be­come in­creas­ingly im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>How are you keep­ing fit dur­ing this pe­riod?</p>
    <p>It is pretty sim­i­lar to how I kept fit be­fore Covid-19, although I would say train­ing for the an­nual J. P. Morgan Cor­po­rate Chal­lenge (JPMCC) has helped in­ten­sify my run­ning rou­tine.</p>
    <p>For the first time in its 44-year his­tory, the race took place vir­tu­ally over a pe­riod of two weeks this month, with no lim­its on the num­ber of times a par­tic­i­pant could com­pete in the 5.6km race within that du­ra­tion. It al­lowed me sev­eral op­por­tu­ni­ties to bet­ter my tim­ings.</p>
    <p>What are the changes you have made to keep ex­er­cis­ing dur­ing this time?</p>
    <p>Run­ning out­doors is free and was never an is­sue from the be­gin­ning. I have also been train­ing for shorter dis­tances to pre­pare for and com­pete in the JPMCC.</p>
    <p>When re­stric­tions were tighter, gym work­outs were re­placed with high-in­ten­sity, in­ter­val-train­ing work­outs that were avail­able on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>How has your ac­tive life­style in­flu­enced your fam­ily and friends?</p>
    <p>My fam­ily has al­ways been ac­tive. They en­joy run­ning, cy­cling, gym work­outs and group-ex­er­cise classes.</p>
    <p>I guess you could say t hey in­flu­enced me at the be­gin­ning and still keep me go­ing now.</p>
    <p>What is the most ex­treme thing you have done in the name of fitness?</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pat­ing in the Me­taSprint Se­ries half-triathlon in 2015 – in which I did a 750m swim, 30km cy­cle and 5km run – would prob­a­bly be it.</p>
    <p>It was a chal­lenge from a friend who ended up pulling out. Noth­ing too crazy, but it was def­i­nitely a new ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>How ex­ten­sive is your col­lec­tion of sports-re­lated para­pher­na­lia? It is mostly just par­tic­i­pa­tion medals from half-marathons and CCA medals from my sec­ondary school days.</p>
    <p>Would you go for plas­tic surgery? No. I am con­fi­dent in how I look.</p>
    <p>Plus, I am al­ready en­gaged, so at least some­one is happy with how I look.</p>
    <p>Do you think you are sexy?</p>
    <p>There is def­i­nitely room for im­prove­ment, but I am happy with where I am now.</p>
