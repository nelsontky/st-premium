    <p>A doc­tor who con­cealed a cam­era in his shoe and used it to record more than 3,000 upskirt videos was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to three years’ jail.</p>
    <p>Chu Ben Wee, 28, is one of the most pro­lific se­rial voyeurs to come be­fore the courts, said Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Sruthi Bop­pana.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tor added that Chu had recorded videos in var­i­ous lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing hos­pi­tals and ju­nior col­leges. They can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect the vic­tims’ iden­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean was ini­tially ar­rested on Jan 18, 2018, but re-of­fended while he was un­der po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion in April last year. Granted bail that same month, he went back to his old ways in July last year.</p>
    <p>Chu, who ap­peared in court via video link, pleaded guilty yes­ter­day to four counts of in­sult­ing the women’s mod­esty. Thir­teen other charges, mainly for sim­i­lar of­fences, were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Chu started record­ing such videos when he was a stu­dent at a pop­u­lar ju­nior col­lege in 2009.</p>
    <p>He later tar­geted women in two hos­pi­tals in 2017 and 2018 but th­ese of­fences went un­de­tected.</p>
    <p>Af­ter record­ing the videos, Chu would trans­fer them to a hard disk, giv­ing the videos ti­tles re­lat­ing to fac­tors such as the vic­tim’s race, es­ti­mated age and type of un­der­wear.</p>
    <p>Chu was fi­nally caught when he tar­geted a woman in a shop at Square 2 shop­ping mall in Novena around 7pm on Jan 18, 2018.</p>
    <p>He was stand­ing close to her when she felt some­thing touch­ing her an­kle.</p>
    <p>The woman spot­ted Chu’s hid­den cam­era when she squat­ted down and pre­tended to look at items on a shelf. She con­fronted him and Chu was later ar­rested.</p>
    <p>When po­lice searched his home the next day, they found hard disks which held nearly 3,000 upskirt videos.</p>
    <p>Chu was re­leased and while un­der po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion, he tar­geted an­other woman in Plaza Sin­ga­pura shop­ping cen­tre on April 27 last year. She alerted the po­lice and Chu was ar­rested soon af­ter.</p>
    <p>Three months later, while out on bail, he bought a T-shirt and trousers com­monly worn by male stu­dents of a ju­nior col­lege.</p>
    <p>He went there on July 31 last year and changed into the clothes so that he could blend in with the stu­dents.</p>
    <p>Chu t hen went around t he school and recorded upskirt videos. A fe­male stu­dent no­ticed he was be­hav­ing in a sus­pi­cious man­ner and Chu was ar­rested yet again.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, DPP Sruthi said that Chu was di­ag­nosed with para­philic and ma­jor de­pres­sive dis­or­ders. Para­philia refers to sex­ual in­ter­est in atyp­i­cal sit­u­a­tions or ob­jects.</p>
    <p>There was, how­ever, no con­trib­u­tory link be­tween his men­tal ill­nesses and the of­fences, added DPP Sruthi.</p>
    <p>She urged Deputy Prin­ci­pal Dis­trict Judge Seah Chi-Ling to sen­tence Chu to at least three years and one month’s jail, stress­ing that his of­fences were pre­med­i­tated.</p>
    <p>De­fence lawyer Luke Lee, how­ever, pleaded for a shorter jail term and said that his client could ben­e­fit from treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Chu’s name was still on the list of reg­is­tered health­care pro­fes­sion­als in Sin­ga­pore as at yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
