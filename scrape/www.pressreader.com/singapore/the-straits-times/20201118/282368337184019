    <p>Down the fi­nal stretch of the Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) sea­son, Lion City Sailors’ hunt for their first ti­tle was handed a boost as they ran out 3-1 win­ners against Hougang United yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But they will be sweat­ing over the fit­ness of their league top scorer Stipe Plaz­i­bat (14 goals), who was with­drawn by coach Aure­lio Vid­mar in the 38th minute as a pre­cau­tion for a “ham­string pinch”.</p>
    <p>With five games re­main­ing over a 14-day stretch, start­ing with Sun­day’s high-stakes clash against Al­birex Ni­igata, Vid­mar is adopt­ing a wait-and-see ap­proach over the next few days.</p>
    <p>“Of course, it will be a big loss for us if Stipe can­not play, but we also have play­ers who are ready to step up when called upon,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Sailors are third on the ta­ble, with the top two spots oc­cu­pied by Al­birex and Tampines Rovers, who beat Balestier Khalsa 2-0 and Young Li­ons 3-1 re­spec­tively in matches else­where yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Al­birex lead the SPL on goal dif­fer­ence as they and Tampines have 20 points from nine games, with the Sailors three points back.</p>
    <p>Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional over­took Hougang for fourth place af­ter beat­ing Tan­jong Pa­gar United 2-1.</p>
    <p>At Hougang Sta­dium, the Chee­tahs ex­pect­edly set up shop to frus­trate, start­ing with a five-man de­fence and with­out a nat­u­ral striker.</p>
    <p>They could have taken a sur­prise lead in the 11th minute when Hafiz Abu Su­jad was re­leased by Fabian Kwok on the left, only to be closed down quickly by Sailors goal­keeper Has­san Sunny.</p>
    <p>Their profli­gacy was pun­ished just one minute later when Gabriel Quak picked him­self up af­ter be­ing fouled by Char­lie Machell to plant a free kick be­yond Rid­huan Barudin.</p>
    <p>De­spite mak­ing sev­eral big saves, Rid­huan could do noth­ing to stop the Sailors from ex­pand­ing their lead with a sweep­ing move in the 58th minute, when Hafiz Nor pol­ished off Aqhari Ab­dul­lah’s square pass.</p>
    <p>Shah­dan Su­laiman killed off the tie by head­ing into an un­guarded net in the 86th minute af­ter Quak’s shot was blocked, fol­low­ing a break led by sub­sti­tute Shahril Ishak.</p>
    <p>Hougang scored a con­so­la­tion in added time through Machell’s penalty.</p>
    <p>Vid­mar said: “It was another su­per ef­fort from the team, as we con­trolled large por­tions of the game. The play­ers showed great de­ter­mi­na­tion and char­ac­ter on a heavy pitch.</p>
    <p>“It’s good to see Hafiz score his first goal of the sea­son, and Shah­dan, Gabriel and Shahril all in­volved in the goals. The im­por­tant thing for us now is to re­cover well for Sun­day’s game.”</p>
    <p>Hougang coach Cle­ment Teo also praised the Sailors front line and said: “We can­not deny they have qual­ity at­tack­ers, and once they get the open­ing goal, op­po­nents who open up to try and equalise tend to get pun­ished.”</p>
