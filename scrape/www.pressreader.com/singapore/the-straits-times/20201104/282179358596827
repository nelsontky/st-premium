    <p>When op­er­a­tions at the com­mu­nity care fa­cil­ity at Sin­ga­pore Expo be­gan, it could take up to only 450 pa­tients in one hall.</p>
    <p>In six weeks, it ramped up its ca­pac­ity to 8,500 across 10 halls.</p>
    <p>This was achieved through the ef­fort of many or­gan­i­sa­tions, which pooled their re­sources and ex­per­tise even as they met chal­lenges, such as hav­ing to set up the fa­cil­ity dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, said PSA In­ter­na­tional group chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Chong Meng.</p>
    <p>Along the way, they had to make changes, such as putting two beds in­stead of the orig­i­nally planned one bed per cu­bi­cle to dou­ble ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants of the Te­masek Trust Con­ver­sa­tion heard yes­ter­day a first-hand ac­count from Mr Tan of the chal­lenges that the or­gan­i­sa­tions faced and over­came while build­ing the fa­cil­ity at Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Expo, which was con­verted in April.</p>
    <p>Te­masek Trust is the phil­an­thropic arm of Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment firm Te­masek.</p>
    <p>Another chal­lenge was sourc­ing for re­quired items, such as beds and par­ti­tions, par­tic­i­pants heard.</p>
    <p>At one point, when con­vert­ing halls 7 to 10, the team ran out of par­ti­tions, and had to scour Sin­ga­pore for them, but ended up with a dif­fer­ent type of par­ti­tions from those used in the first few halls.</p>
    <p>The team worked hours on end be­fore the first hall was ready in six days, par­tic­i­pants heard.</p>
    <p>Mul­ti­ple toi­lets had to be built as an ex­hi­bi­tion hall would not reg­u­larly be equipped to cope with peo­ple show­er­ing by the dozen.</p>
    <p>A safe cor­ri­dor also had to be built for the med­i­cal per­son­nel, to min­imise their ex­po­sure while per­form­ing their du­ties, and that took engi­neer­ing ef­fort.</p>
    <p>When the fa­cil­ity opened on April 10, the ob­sta­cles did not cease.</p>
    <p>That evening, the first group of 20 pa­tients were sent in two batches. But the sec­ond batch – of nine men and one woman – posed a prob­lem as the fa­cil­ity was not seg­re­gated by gen­der.</p>
    <p>The woman had to be sent back,</p>
    <p>said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>Other in­ci­dents in­cluded a false fire alarm leading to the shut­ters go­ing up, a loss of seg­re­ga­tion be­tween the “clean” and “dirty” ar­eas and miss­ing shower han­dles.</p>
    <p>Many or­gan­i­sa­tions chipped in to man­age the large fa­cil­ity and all were driven by a com­mon pur­pose to get the job done, said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded Sur­bana Jurong, SingEx, Cer­tis, PSA In­ter­na­tional, ST Engi­neer­ing, the Min­istry of Health, Wood­lands Health Cam­pus, Park­way Pan­tai, Sheares Healthcare and Re­sorts World Sen­tosa.</p>
