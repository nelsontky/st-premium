    <p>The Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Authority (Acra) is ex­pand­ing its probe and will be look­ing into all reg­is­tered en­ti­ties linked to Sin­ga­porean cousins Nel­son and Ter­ence Loh.</p>
    <p>Acra was re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times af­ter the paper re­ported yes­ter­day that the po­lice had com­menced in­ves­ti­ga­tions into one of the Lohs’ firms for al­legedly us­ing unau­tho­rised sig­na­tures of an ac­count­ing firm on its fi­nan­cial state­ments. The authority had ear­lier found that Novena Global Healthcare and Novena Life Sciences – owned by the Lohs – had failed to file an­nual re­turns due on July 29, 2018 and Dec 9 last year, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>An Acra spokesman said yes­ter­day that en­force­ment ac­tions are on­go­ing in re­la­tion to the two firms, and added: “Acra is also look­ing into other re­lated reg­is­tered en­ti­ties on their obli­ga­tions to hold an­nual gen­eral meet­ings (AGM) and file an­nual re­turns.”</p>
    <p>En­force­ment ac­tions in­clude im­pos­ing a penalty for late fil­ing. Acra may also de­cide to pros­e­cute the com­pa­nies and/or their di­rec­tors in court.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said that breach­ing an obli­ga­tion to hold an AGM and to file an­nual re­turns car­ries a fine of up to $5,000 each, upon con­vic­tion by the courts.</p>
    <p>Mr Ter­ence Loh, 42 and Mr Nel­son Loh, 40, came into the spot­light last month af­ter their re­ported £280 mil­lion (S$490 mil­lion) takeover bid for English Premier League club New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the po­lice launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into Novena Global Healthcare Group, a hold­ing com­pany in­cor­po­rated in the Cay­man Is­lands for the Lohs’ healthcare busi­nesses, af­ter ac­count­ing firm Ernst & Young re­ported to the au­thor­i­ties last week that the firm did not sign off on or au­tho­rise the sig­na­tures found on some of the fi­nan­cial state­ments of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>ST un­der­stands that Mr Ter­ence Loh gave his state­ment to the po­lice on Wed­nes­day. It is not known if Mr Nel­son Loh has also given his state­ment.</p>
    <p>The Lohs had reg­is­tered a sub­sidiary, Novena Global Healthcare, in Sin­ga­pore in Novem­ber 2016, which has an of­fice in Novena Gardens.</p>
    <p>ST found more than 20 com­pa­nies reg­is­tered to that same unit in Thom­son Road.</p>
    <p>From Jan­uary to July this year, the Lohs reg­is­tered 10 firms with Acra, in­clud­ing Bel­la­graph Nova (BN), which they co-founded with their Chi­nese busi­ness part­ner Evan­ge­line Shen, 32, with a paid-up cap­i­tal of $20 mil­lion. BN Group was formed in July fol­low­ing a merger of the Loh cousins’ Dorr Group and Ms Shen’s Bel­la­graph Group.</p>
    <p>Acra searches by ST yes­ter­day found that Dorr Global Healthcare In­ter­na­tional, which was in­cor­po­rated in 2016 by the Loh cousins, had a charge by DBS Bank in June this year. Two other firms – Novena Ap­tus and Novena No­vap­tus, which were in­cor­po­rated in Jan­uary this year – also had charges on them reg­is­tered by Citibank. A charge is a form of se­cu­rity in­ter­est usu­ally taken by a lender or cred­i­tor – “chargee” – to se­cure re­pay­ment of a loan.</p>
    <p>Sources told ST that the Loh cousins had ob­tained mil­lions in loans from DBS, Citibank and United Over­seas Bank in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>All three banks de­clined to com­ment.</p>
