    <p>Malaysia’s pro­posal to change a fun­da­men­tal fea­ture of the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore high-speed rail (HSR) agree­ment, which Sin­ga­pore could not ac­cept, has led to the ter­mi­na­tion of the project. This is an un­for­tu­nate out­come be­cause the rail link would have ben­e­fited both coun­tries and con­trib­uted to the in­fras­truc­tural con­nec­tiv­ity that would have added to Asean’s in­te­gra­tion as a sin­gle eco­nomic re­gion. The episode pro­vides a salu­tary les­son in the va­garies of in­ter­na­tional com­mer­cial deal­ings when fun­da­men­tal con­trac­tual com­mit­ments are sought to be al­tered uni­lat­er­ally. In the af­ter­math of a highly an­tic­i­pated rail link that has now come to nought, Malaysia will need to com­pen­sate Sin­ga­pore in full for the costs that the Repub­lic has al­ready in­curred. This is the least that can be done and is in keep­ing with the terms of the agree­ment be­tween the two neigh­bours, whose mu­tual in­ter­ests must now also tran­scend the aborted HSR project – im­por­tant though it could have been in bring­ing their peo­ples and economies closer.</p>
    <p>The fun­da­men­tal dif­fer­ence had to do with Malaysia’s pro­posal to re­move the project’s sys­tems sup­plier and net­work op­er­a­tor. The As­sets Com­pany (As­set­sCo) was cru­cial in pro­tect­ing the in­ter­ests of both coun­tries be­cause nei­ther of them had the ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence nec­es­sary to op­er­ate the HSR. Hence the need to ap­point a cred­i­ble player that would sup­ply the train sys­tem and op­er­ate the net­work while re­main­ing ac­count­able to both na­tions. That dual ac­count­abil­ity would have min­imised the chances of dis­putes break­ing out dur­ing the du­ra­tion of a project span­ning decades. Malaysia’s ar­gu­ment now, that it would save 30 per cent of costs by not us­ing As­set­sCo’s ser­vices, clearly did not fea­ture in the orig­i­nal HSR agree­ment. In the event, Sin­ga­pore had no op­tion but to re­ject the Malaysian pro­posal, which marked a fun­da­men­tal de­par­ture from what had been agreed upon. Malaysia thus caused the agree­ment to lapse on the Dec 31 dead­line last year. That marked the end of the jour­ney for an agree­ment signed in 2016 af­ter three years of ne­go­ti­a­tions and of hopes on both sides since then that the project would pro­ceed in spite of in­ter­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>Of course, eco­nomic, po­lit­i­cal and so­cial re­la­tions be­tween Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore are much larger than the can­celled HSR project. Mov­ing for­ward, it would help both na­tions to build on ex­ist­ing ar­eas of co­op­er­a­tion and ex­plore new op­por­tu­ni­ties to syn­er­gise their strengths. The cross­bor­der Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Jo­hor is a case in point. The 4km rail link, tar­geted to now start in 2026, has not been im­pacted by the can­cel­la­tion of the HSR project and will no doubt con­trib­ute to eas­ing sig­nif­i­cant con­ges­tion on the Cause­way, thus help­ing im­prove the flow of peo­ple and goods on both sides.</p>
