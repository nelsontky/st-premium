    <p>Karaoke has not been al­lowed to re­sume un­der the Covid-19 re­stric­tions. The con­cern of the au­thor­i­ties is that the na­ture of the ac­tiv­ity in­volves singing in groups with the po­ten­tial of spread­ing the virus through wa­ter droplets.</p>
    <p>By the same ar­gu­ment, I am also very con­cerned about al­low­ing sports like bas­ket­ball. This is a group and con­tact sport. It also in­volves much shout­ing among the play­ers dur­ing the game.</p>
    <p>As there are two teams com­pet­ing against each other, this means there are 10 peo­ple in con­stant con­tact for the du­ra­tion of the game. Also, there are spec­ta­tors sup­port­ing the teams, who are also shout­ing and sit­ting close to one an­other.</p>
    <p>At one bas­ket­ball court, there could be a num­ber of groups play­ing at any given point of time.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties must make a de­ci­sion to stop these po­ten­tial su­per spread­ers by is­su­ing a pub­lic an­nounce­ment that play­ing bas­ket­ball is not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers from the res­i­dent com­mit­tees and town coun­cil, as well as vol­un­teers, must report any flout­ing of rules to the au­thor­i­ties for im­me­di­ate ac­tion.</p>
    <p>As these games are played in the evening and some­times through to mid­night, a spe­cial task force should be as­sem­bled to en­force the rule dur­ing this cru­cial pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Ide­ally, the game should be al­lowed only at the fi­nal phase of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>Hope­fully, the bas­ket­ball play­ers and fans un­der­stand the need for cau­tious ac­tion.</p>
