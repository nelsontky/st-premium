    <p>VAN­COU­VER • Huawei ex­ec­u­tive Meng Wanzhou and her lawyers were to re­turn to a Canadian court yes­ter­day to press for her re­lease, ar­gu­ing that the US mis­led Canada about her al­leged crimes to se­cure her de­ten­tion on for­eign soil.</p>
    <p>The de­fence, ac­cord­ing to court fil­ings, will say that the crux of the US charges against Meng – that she hid Huawei’s ties with for­mer sub­sidiary Sky­com in Iran from HSBC bank – is false and lacks con­text.</p>
    <p>“Putting such a mis­lead­ing and in­com­plete record be­fore this court dis­qual­i­fies it from con­tin­u­ing these pro­ceed­ings,” the fil­ing says.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese tele­com gi­ant’s chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer was ar­rested on a US war­rant in De­cem­ber 2018 dur­ing a stopover in Van­cou­ver. She is charged with bank fraud linked to vi­o­la­tions of US sanc­tions against Iran, and has been fight­ing ex­tra­di­tion ever since.</p>
    <p>The case has added to se­vere strain in Sino-US ties and cre­ated an un­prece­dented rift be­tween Canada and China.</p>
    <p>Nine days af­ter Meng’s ar­rest, China de­tained for­mer Canadian diplo­mat Michael Kovrig and busi­ness­man Michael Spavor in what is widely viewed as re­tal­i­a­tion. Es­pi­onage charges were filed against the pair in June.</p>
    <p>The past nearly two years of court ap­pear­ances have so far seen Meng’s at­tor­neys trade barbs with Canadian gov­ern­ment lawyers over ac­cess to clas­si­fied doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>The de­fence also ac­cused US and Canadian au­thor­i­ties of hav­ing con­spired to gather ev­i­dence and in­ter­ro­gate Meng with­out a lawyer af­ter she dis­em­barked from a Hong Kong flight but be­fore she was charged, in vi­o­la­tion of her rights.</p>
    <p>Canada, they noted, pro­vided se­rial numbers and tech­ni­cal spec­i­fi­ca­tions of her smart­phones, tablet and lap­top com­puter to the FBI.</p>
    <p>“The At­tor­ney-Gen­eral of Canada doesn’t ac­cept there was any con­spir­acy to de­prive Ms Meng of her rights,” Crown coun­sel Robert Frater said in July.</p>
    <p>At Meng’s last hear­ing, in mid-Au­gust, her l awyers said they ex­pected her to ap­pear in per­son yes­ter­day for the first time in months.</p>
    <p>US in­dict­ments al­lege that Meng and the world’s largest tele­coms equip­ment man­u­fac­turer con­ducted busi­ness in Iran in vi­o­la­tion of US sanc­tions through Sky­com.</p>
    <p>The US Jus­tice Depart­ment says the Hong Kong-reg­is­tered firm was a Huawei front firm. They note that Sky­com’s lead­er­ship were Huawei staff – in­clud­ing Meng, who has ad­mit­ted to serv­ing on its board.</p>
    <p>Huawei also at one point owned a stake in Sky­com but sold its shares to an­other firm that the US says was also con­trolled by Huawei.</p>
    <p>The US al­leges Meng fraud­u­lently con­cealed all this from HSBC, putting the bank at risk of un­know­ingly vi­o­lat­ing Iran sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>It pointed to a pre­sen­ta­tion Meng made in 2013 to an HSBC ex­ec­u­tive af­ter the Bri­tish bank­ing group, wor­ried over po­ten­tial Iran ex­po­sure, re­quested an ex­pla­na­tion.</p>
    <p>But Meng, 48, in­sists she was up­front with the HSBC ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>Meng, the daugh­ter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, has said Sky­com was merely a “busi­ness part­ner” in Iran and that Huawei’s deal­ings there did not vi­o­late global stan­dards or US law.</p>
