    <p>They are in their 30s to 50s, ma­ture and inch­ing to­wards re­tire­ment, but they still think they are very young and can, well, live for­ever – so they tend to spend more rather than save.</p>
    <p>Af­ter all, they keep fit, ex­er­cise reg­u­larly and are con­fi­dent they can keep work­ing way past their 60s or even 70s. So why plan for re­tire­ment when they don’t ac­tu­ally plan to re­tire at all?</p>
    <p>In fi­nan­cial plan­ning cir­cles, such peo­ple are termed “Peter Pans”, af­ter the fic­tional char­ac­ter in the fa­mous fa­ble who can stay young for­ever.</p>
    <p>But the re­al­ity is much harsher for these folks be­cause many are likely to find them­selves very short of money in old age.</p>
    <p>If you do not have am­ple sav­ings and lose your job through no fault of your own, how are you go­ing to sup­port your­self, not for one or two years, but for the next 20?</p>
    <p>Yes, you think you can still work, but what if jobs are not read­ily avail­able, such as the sit­u­a­tion we now find our­selves in?</p>
    <p>A re­cent OCBC sur­vey has un­cov­ered some wor­ry­ing trends – 75 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans not only do not do suf­fi­cient plan­ning for re­tire­ment, 37 per cent of them ac­tu­ally live by the day and do not even think about sav­ing for old age.</p>
    <p>“The sur­vey shows that Sin­ga­pore­ans are not very good at plan­ning for re­tire­ment and the pan­demic has even made it worse,” says Ms Koh Ching Ching, OCBC’s head of group brand and com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>LIV­ING WITH FALSE IM­PRES­SION</p>
    <p>Even for those who have started plan­ning, a key rea­son why most are likely to end up short is that they un­der­es­ti­mate how much they would need to keep up with their life­style. A rea­son for this is that most peo­ple will just look at what they have now in­stead of what they will need.</p>
    <p>And since many do not have the habit of plan­ning their bud­gets and keep­ing track of ex­penses, it is un­likely they know how much they will need every month, let alone for the rest of their lives.</p>
    <p>Take this sce­nario: You have $500,000 in your sav­ings ac­count and since the amount is quite sub­stan­tial, you are lulled into think­ing you will have enough to last you through old age. So you just con­tinue to spend about $4,000 monthly, just like what you have been do­ing when you were work­ing.</p>
    <p>As money kept in sav­ings ac­counts will not earn much in­ter­est, a sim­ple cal­cu­la­tion re­veals that with such monthly ex­pen­di­ture, your sav­ings will last you just over 10 years.</p>
    <p>The OCBC sur­vey has iden­ti­fied three com­mon mis­takes that most peo­ple make when it comes to plan­ning for re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>NEVER BOTHER TO CHECK EX­PENSES</p>
    <p>It is not every day that the Gov­ern­ment will give free $100 vouch­ers for Sin­ga­pore­ans to have fun amid the re­ces­sion. Many good things need money and if you do not even check how much you spend every month now, how are you go­ing to know how much you will need af­ter you stop work­ing?</p>
    <p>TOO COM­PLA­CENT</p>
    <p>Not sur­pris­ingly, al­most 80 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans un­der­es­ti­mated how much money they would need at re­tire­ment. Among these folks, those aged 55 and above fared bet­ter as they were off the mark by only about 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>Most mil­len­ni­als – 21 to 39 – fared the worst as many un­der­es­ti­mated what they would need by about 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>OKAY TO START LATER</p>
    <p>The Peter Pan syn­drome has made many peo­ple as­sume that they do not need to plan for re­tire­ment un­til they are much older. So, in­stead of sav­ing or in­vest­ing for old age, they plan only for short-term needs such as buy­ing homes, cars and go­ing on hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately for those who are em­ployed, they have the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) to fall back on, un­less they have spent most of the funds there on home loans.</p>
    <p>For those who are self-em­ployed, the sit­u­a­tion will be very dire if they do not make plans or even make CPF con­tri­bu­tions for them­selves.</p>
    <p>That said, a good re­tire­ment plan is not just about hav­ing enough money for your ex­penses. You need to fac­tor in con­tin­gen­cies that could dis­rupt those plans.</p>
    <p>CON­TIN­U­OUS IN­COME FOR LIFE</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are for­tu­nate that they have CPF Life to fall back on the mo­ment they hit 65.</p>
    <p>This is why it is vi­tal for ev­ery­one to try to hit the en­hanced re­tire­ment sum, which will be $279,000 next year, so that they can re­ceive about $2,200 a month. If both hus­band and wife are on such schemes, they will get a monthly in­come of $4,400 a month for the rest of their lives. By the time they are 85, they would have re­ceived over $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>More savvy plan­ners will even have other sources of in­come, such as in­vest­ment re­turns and ren­tal in­come from ad­di­tional prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>IN­SUR­ANCE COV­ER­AGE</p>
    <p>Again, the CPF en­sures that Sin­ga­pore­ans are cov­ered un­der the MediShield and CareShield Life schemes. Those who want more cov­er­age should start in­vest­ing in pri­vate med­i­cal in­sur­ance as well as whole life poli­cies that can be ad­di­tional sources of in­come in old age.</p>
    <p>LIFE SAV­INGS</p>
    <p>If you have suc­ceeded in plan­ning for a good reg­u­lar in­come af­ter 65, you will not need to rely on the cash that you have stashed away for your nor­mal ex­penses. In­stead this will be the ex­tra you can use to pam­per your­self or as emer­gency funds to tide over any cri­sis.</p>
    <p>In short, a sound re­tire­ment plan will not only help you to avoid be­ing poor in old age, but you will also have a good re­tire­ment and be able to even help oth­ers in need. Af­ter all, isn’t this why you are work­ing so hard now?</p>
    <p>Al­most 80 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans un­der­es­ti­mated how much money they would need at re­tire­ment.</p>
