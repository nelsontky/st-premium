    <p>BEI­JING • In Shang­hai, restau­rants and bars in many neigh­bour­hoods are teem­ing with crowds.</p>
    <p>In Bei­jing, thou­sands of stu­dents are head­ing back to campus for the au­tumn se­mes­ter.</p>
    <p>In Wuhan, where the coro­n­avirus was first de­tected eight months ago, wa­ter parks and night mar­kets are packed el­bow to el­bow, buzzing like be­fore.</p>
    <p>While the United States and much of the world are still strug­gling to con­tain the Covid-19 pan­demic, life in many parts of China has in re­cent weeks be­come strik­ingly nor­mal.</p>
    <p>Cities have re­laxed so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules and mask man­dates, and crowds are again fill­ing tourist sites, movie the­atres and gyms.</p>
    <p>When photos cir­cu­lated world­wide in re­cent days show­ing thou­sands of peo­ple swim­ming shoul­der to shoul­der at a pool rave in Wuhan, prompt­ing some crit­i­cism overseas, Chi­nese com­men­ta­tors were quick to de­fend the party.</p>
    <p>Global Times, a state-run news­pa­per, called the re­ac­tion to the photos “for­eign sour grapes”.</p>
    <p>Ms Yuki Liu, a 28-year-old who works at a for­eign trad­ing com­pany, and her hus­band at­tended the pool party this month in Wuhan.</p>
    <p>She said the event made her feel “re­laxed and free”, like she was en­joy­ing a beach va­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“To be hon­est, I al­most for­got about the epi­demic. As long as peo­ple didn’t sneeze all the time or spit, I just felt they were nor­mal peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>The re­turn to nor­mal­ity has made China an out­lier in the global econ­omy. The US is fac­ing a po­ten­tially long and painful re­ces­sion, as some places have reim­posed re­stric­tions to con­tend with a surge in coro­n­avirus cases this sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral coun­tries in Europe have been ex­pe­ri­enc­ing fresh out­breaks, putting ad­di­tional pres­sure on an al­ready weak econ­omy.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, China has been slowly re­cov­er­ing in re­cent months, and its fac­to­ries are hum­ming again, al­though its growth is still weaker than be­fore the pan­demic, and job losses are sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>It is a stark turn­about from the early days of the pan­demic, when the Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties im­posed sweep­ing lock­downs.</p>
    <p>De­spite a de­layed re­sponse and early mis­steps by the govern­ment, the re­cov­ery in China points to the suc­cess of the ex­treme tac­tics.</p>
    <p>Af­ter months of travel re­stric­tions and city­wide test­ing drives, lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases of the virus in China are near zero, ac­cord­ing to of­fi­cial data.</p>
    <p>China’s Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion yes­ter­day re­ported that China on Sun­day had no new lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases. The 16 new in­fec­tions it re­ported were all im­ported, bring­ing China’s to­tal num­ber of con­firmed cases to 84,967, with the death toll re­main­ing at 4,634.</p>
    <p>In the US yes­ter­day, some 5.8 mil­lion peo­ple have been in­fected and more than 180,000 have died.</p>
    <p>Now, many Chi­nese cities are once again host­ing large events, though with some lim­its on crowd sizes, af­ter months of such gath­er­ings be­ing banned en­tirely.</p>
    <p>Qing­dao, a sea­side city in east­ern China, is hold­ing its pop­u­lar beer fes­ti­val this month largely as planned, and face masks are op­tional. Shang­hai re­cently held a gam­ing con­ven­tion that at­tracted thou­sands of en­thu­si­asts.</p>
    <p>China’s lead­ers, hop­ing to bol­ster the econ­omy, are ea­ger for peo­ple to get back to work and start shop­ping and trav­el­ling again.</p>
    <p>But they are also tak­ing a cau­tious ap­proach, re­quir­ing movie the­atres and tourist sites, for ex­am­ple, to op­er­ate at half-ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>To get into banks, restau­rants and other pub­lic venues, res­i­dents must un­dergo tem­per­a­ture checks and show dig­i­tal codes ver­i­fy­ing that they are healthy and have not trav­elled re­cently to ar­eas where there have been clus­ters of new in­fec­tion cases.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties also con­tinue to re­strict travel in the Xin­jiang re­gion in western China, where an out­break last month prompted a lock­down.</p>
    <p>China still pro­hibits most for­eign­ers from en­ter­ing the coun­try, for fear that they could bring the virus.</p>
    <p>There have been out­breaks in re­cent months, but in each case the re­sponse was swift.</p>
    <p>When Wuhan – where the out­break first emerged late last year – re­ported six Covid-19 cases in May, break­ing a streak of more than a month with­out any con­firmed in­fec­tions, the city launched a plan to test all 11 mil­lion of its peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The state news me­dia is point­ing to the re­turn of large gath­er­ings and classes as ev­i­dence of China’s su­pe­rior re­sponse to the virus, es­pe­cially when com­pared with the US and other Western coun­tries whose of­fi­cials are deal­ing with a ris­ing num­ber of cases.</p>
    <p>China could still face a Covid-19 resur­gence, ex­perts warn, es­pe­cially as the weather cools and peo­ple spend more time in­doors.</p>
    <p>“They still need to be cau­tious,” said Pro­fes­sor David Hui, di­rec­tor of the Stan­ley Ho Cen­tre for Emerg­ing In­fec­tious Dis­eases at the Chi­nese Univer­sity of Hong Kong. “Mass gath­er­ings and mass cel­e­bra­tions should not be en­cour­aged.”</p>
    <p>Some Chi­nese res­i­dents are wor­ried that the pub­lic is be­com­ing too dis­mis­sive of the virus.</p>
    <p>Ms Cheng Ailin, 59, who re­cently vis­ited a gorge in Guang­dong that was crowded with tourists, said she was shocked to see that most peo­ple were not wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>“There were no con­trol and preven­tion mea­sures. If there were a coro­n­avirus case, the con­se­quences would be unimag­in­able, and the trou­ble would have no end,” she said.</p>
