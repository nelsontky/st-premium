    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Bil­lion­aire en­tre­pre­neur Elon Musk’s neu­ro­science start-up Neu­ralink has un­veiled a pig named Gertrude which has had a coin-size com­puter chip in her brain for two months, show­ing off an early step to­wards the goal of cur­ing hu­man dis­eases with the same type of im­plant.</p>
    <p>Neu­ralink, co-founded in 2016 by Mr Musk, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Tesla Inc and SpaceX, aims to im­plant wire­less brain-com­puter in­ter­faces that i nclude thou­sands of elec­trodes into the most com­plex hu­man or­gan to help cure neu­ro­log­i­cal con­di­tions such as Alzheimer’s, de­men­tia and spinal cord in­juries, and ul­ti­mately fuse hu­mankind with ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>“An im­plantable de­vice can ac­tu­ally solve these prob­lems,” Mr Musk said in a we­b­cast on Friday, men­tion­ing ail­ments such as mem­ory loss, hearing loss, de­pres­sion and in­som­nia.</p>
    <p>He did not pro­vide a time­line for those treat­ments, ap­pear­ing to re­treat from ear­lier state­ments that hu­man tri­als would be­gin by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Neu­ralink’s first clin­i­cal tri­als with a small num­ber of hu­man pa­tients would be aimed at treat­ing paral­y­sis or para­ple­gia, said its head sur­geon Matthew MacDougall.</p>
    <p>Neu­ro­sci­en­tists un­af­fil­i­ated with Neu­ralink said the pre­sen­ta­tion in­di­cated that the San Fran­cis­cobased com­pany had made great strides, but cau­tioned that longer stud­ies were needed.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk pre­sented what he de­scribed as the “three lit­tle pigs demo”. Gertrude, the pig with a Neu­ralink im­plant in the part of her brain that con­trols the snout, re­quired some coax­ing by Mr Musk to ap­pear on cam­era, but even­tu­ally be­gan eat­ing off a stool and sniff­ing straw, trig­ger­ing spikes on a graph track­ing her neu­ral ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk said the com­pany had three pigs with two im­plants each, and also re­vealed a pig that pre­vi­ously had an im­plant. They were</p>
    <p>“healthy, happy and in­dis­tin­guish­able from a nor­mal pig”, he said, adding that the com­pany pre­dicted a pig’s limb move­ment dur­ing a tread­mill run at “high ac­cu­racy” us­ing im­plant data.</p>
    <p>He de­scribed Neu­ralink’s chip, which is 23mm in di­am­e­ter, as “a</p>
    <p>Fit­bit in your skull with tiny wires”.</p>
    <p>“I could have a Neu­ralink right now and you wouldn’t know... Maybe I do,” he said.</p>
    <p>One com­ment from a we­b­cast viewer de­scribed the an­i­mals as “Cy­pork”.</p>
    <p>Dr Graeme Mof­fat, a Univer­sity of Toronto neu­ro­science re­search fel­low, said Neu­ralink’s ad­vance­ments were “or­der of mag­ni­tude leaps” be­yond cur­rent sci­ence, thanks to the novel chip’s size, porta­bil­ity, power man­age­ment and wire­less ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Stan­ford Univer­sity neu­ro­sci­en­tist Sergey Stavisky said the com­pany had made sub­stan­tial and im­pres­sive progress since an ini­tial demon­stra­tion of an ear­lier chip in July last year.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing from that to the fully im­planted sys­tem in sev­eral pigs they showed is im­pres­sive and, I think, re­ally high­lights the strengths of hav­ing a large multi-dis­ci­plinary team fo­cused on this prob­lem,” said Dr Stavisky.</p>
    <p>Some re­searchers said l onger stud­ies would be re­quired to de­ter­mine the longevity of the de­vice.</p>
    <p>Neu­ralink’s chip could also im­prove the un­der­stand­ing of neu­ro­log­i­cal dis­eases by read­ing brain waves, one of the com­pany’s sci­en­tists said dur­ing the pre­sen­ta­tion.</p>
