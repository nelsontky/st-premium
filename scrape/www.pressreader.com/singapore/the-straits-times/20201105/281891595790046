    <p>The Mum­bai po­lice ar­rested Indian chan­nel Repub­lic TV’s ed­i­tor-in-chief Arnab Goswami yes­ter­day morn­ing over a 2018 sui­cide case in which investigat­ions were re­opened re­cently.</p>
    <p>As he was be­ing taken into a po­lice van, Mr Goswami shouted into news cam­eras that he and his fam­ily were as­saulted in­side his house.</p>
    <p>Repub­lic TV footage showed about 20 po­lice­men around Mr Goswami’s house. Another video showed him seated on a sofa and a po­lice­man push­ing him.</p>
    <p>His wife Samyabrata Ray said: “They thrashed Arnab and held him by his hair. Arnab said he wants his lawyer to come.</p>
    <p>“They said that Arnab is be­ing taken to the Raigad po­lice sta­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Goswami’s ar­rest comes in the wake of a months-long tus­sle with the Mum­bai po­lice.</p>
    <p>The hawk­ish news an­chor is known for his stri­dent nightly de­bates and po­si­tions favour­ing the Naren­dra Modi gov­ern­ment and the rul­ing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
    <p>In Ma­ha­rash­tra, the BJP is in the op­po­si­tion, and Mr Goswami has fre­quently taken on the state’s lo­cal gov­ern­ment and po­lice.</p>
    <p>Most re­cently, he ac­cused the po­lice in Mum­bai, the state cap­i­tal, of botch­ing investigat­ions into the death of ac­tor Sushant Singh Ra­jput in June.</p>
    <p>Although early med­i­cal re­ports deemed it a sui­cide, Mr Goswami in­sisted the ac­tor was mur­dered.</p>
    <p>His English-lan­guage Repub­lic TV chan­nel and Hindi-lan­guage Repub­lic Bharat ran high-pitched news re­ports for months, ac­cus­ing the ac­tor’s girl­friend and her fam­ily of abet­ment to sui­cide, drug traf­fick­ing and money laun­der­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Goswami claimed that Repub­lic TV’s cov­er­age of the is­sue boosted its view­er­ship to record lev­els.</p>
    <p>But the Mum­bai po­lice filed a com­plaint against the chan­nel and two oth­ers for rig­ging the rat­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>The po­lice also filed sep­a­rate complaints against him for air­ing defam­a­tory con­tent and incit­ing re­li­gious ten­sions.</p>
    <p>Mum­bai po­lice rep­re­sen­ta­tives said Mr Goswami had been ar­rested in con­nec­tion with a May 2018 case over the abet­ment of the sui­cide of 53-yearold in­te­rior de­signer An­vay Naik and his mother.</p>
    <p>The vic­tims’ fam­ily filed the case in Raigad, Ma­ha­rash­tra, claim­ing that the two killed them­selves be­cause Repub­lic TV did not pay its dues to the de­signer.</p>
    <p>“Arnab Goswami is cur­rently be­ing taken to Raigad. He shall be in­ter­ro­gated by the in­ves­ti­gat­ing of­fi­cer and the fur­ther course of ac­tion will be de­cided ac­cord­ingly,” In­spec­tor-Gen­eral San­jay Mo­hite of Konkan Range, where Raigad is un­der, told the Indian Ex­press.</p>
    <p>Soon after the ar­rest, sev­eral min­is­ters in the rul­ing BJP gov­ern­ment in Delhi crit­i­cised it.</p>
    <p>In­dus­tries Min­is­ter Prakash Javadekar tweeted: “We con­demn the at­tack on press free­dom in Ma­ha­rash­tra. This is not the way to treat the press.”</p>
    <p>Law Min­is­ter Ravi Shankar Prasad called it “se­ri­ously rep­re­hen­si­ble, un­war­ranted and wor­ri­some”.</p>
    <p>Repub­lic TV footage showed about 20 po­lice­men around Mr Arnab Goswami’s house. Another video showed him seated on a sofa, and a po­lice­man push­ing him.</p>
