    <p>Wok Hei Prawn Noo­dles ($22, above)</p>
    <p>This messy-look­ing dish is the eatery’s ver­sion of fried Hokkien prawn mee, with Ital­ian fet­tuc­cine re­plac­ing the usual rice and yel­low noo­dles.</p>
    <p>That is a mis­take be­cause, un­like Chi­nese noo­dles, the thick pasta rib­bons do not soak up the prawn stock they are braised in. There is no blend­ing of flavours and the dish ends up rather soggy.</p>
    <p>That is a shame be­cause oth­er­wise, it is ex­cel­lent. It de­liv­ers the wok hei its name prom­ises, with the egg fried on high heat un­til it is on the brink of burn­ing to cre­ate a mag­i­cal smok­i­ness.</p>
    <p>It is a gen­er­ous por­tion, with two good-sized grilled prawns, a scal­lop and squid rings. Though the prawns are slightly over­cooked, the rest of the seafood is just right.</p>
    <p>Har Cheong Gai ($13)</p>
    <p>I like that the restau­rant uses bone­less chicken thigh for this ubiq­ui­tous Sin­ga­pore dish and not the chicken wings one of­ten gets at zichar stalls.</p>
    <p>Though a bit less moist on the in­side, the strips of skin are fried to ex­quis­ite crisp­ness. Eaten on its own, the chicken is a tad salty from the fer­mented shrimp paste used to mar­i­nate it. But on the plus side is a fra­grance that would be miss­ing without that amount of paste.</p>
    <p>The chef makes it work with a sweet and sour peanut sauce on the side. Just a dab gets the var­i­ous flavours bal­anc­ing one an­other per­fectly.</p>
    <p>I lucked out at lunch be­cause, be­sides the usual choco­late and vanilla ice cream on the menu, there was an ad­di­tional choice of jas­mine pearl sake ice cream.</p>
    <p>It was re­ally good, as the fra­grance of jas­mine tea was jazzed up with a whis­per of al­co­hol. There were no pearls in sight but the ice cream tasted rich and smooth.</p>
    <p>It paired well with the brownie, which was moist and lus­ciously rich with dark choco­late.</p>
