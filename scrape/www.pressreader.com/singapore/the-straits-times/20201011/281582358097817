    <p>The Malaysian King is set to play a key role in what hap­pens next af­ter op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim claimed he had majority sup­port to form a govern­ment.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war said he has an au­di­ence on Tues­day with the monarch, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, to prove his as­ser­tion.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin has main­tained that he is still the le­git­i­mate leader.</p>
    <p>Here are a few ways the King could de­cide to re­solve the im­passe:</p>
    <p>1 CALL AN ELEC­TION</p>
    <p>The King has the power to dis­solve Par­lia­ment, af­ter which an elec­tion must be held within 60 days.</p>
    <p>Law­mak­ers from the rul­ing and op­po­si­tion coali­tions have called for snap polls to re­solve the po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty once and for all, as Tan Sri Muhyid­din was sworn into of­fice in March fol­low­ing the col­lapse of a govern­ment that took power af­ter the 2018 gen­eral elec­tion. Mr Muhyid­din could also call an elec­tion, which he had said he might do if his al­liance wins the Sabah state polls. His Gabun­gan Rakyat Sabah did win the Sabah polls on Sept 26.</p>
    <p>2 SEEK NO-CON­FI­DENCE VOTE</p>
    <p>The monarch could re­quest the Speaker of the Lower House to bring for­ward the next par­lia­men­tary sit­ting, cur­rently set for Nov 2, to hold a vote of no con­fi­dence ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion has been plan­ning to chal­lenge Mr Muhyid­din’s sup­port in Par­lia­ment for months, but the Speaker has re­peat­edly placed the mo­tion at the bot­tom of the agenda.</p>
    <p>In July, Mr Muhyid­din proved he held a slim majority in Par­lia­ment when he re­placed the Speaker.</p>
    <p>3 AP­POINT PRIME MIN­IS­TER</p>
    <p>Af­ter for­mer premier Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad abruptly re­signed in Fe­bru­ary, the King spent days speak­ing with each of the 222 law­mak­ers to find out who they sup­port, which led to Mr Muhyid­din’s ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>This time, there is no lead­er­ship vac­uum, so the monarch may need to urge the cur­rent premier to step down if Mr An­war has the back­ing of a majority of law­mak­ers in Par­lia­ment.</p>
