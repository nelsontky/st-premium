    <p>Em­bat­tled oil ty­coon Lim Oon Kuin is out on $3 mil­lion bail after be­ing charged yes­ter­day with abet­ment of forgery for the pur­pose of cheat­ing.</p>
    <p>Bet­ter known as O.K. Lim, the 78-year-old founder of Hin Leong Trad­ing was ac­cused by the Sin­ga­pore po­lice of “in­sti­gat­ing” Mr Freddy Tan Jie Ren, a con­tracts ex­ec­u­tive of the com­pany, to forge a doc­u­ment pur­port­edly is­sued by</p>
    <p>UT Sin­ga­pore Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Charge sheets filed in the State Courts con­tend that Lim in­structed Mr Tan to make an “ITT cer­tifi­cate” – or In­ter-Tank trans­fer cer­tifi­cate on the let­ter­head of UT Sin­ga­pore Ser­vices. The doc­u­ment stated that Hin Leong had trans­ferred 1.05 mil­lion bar­rels of gasoil to China Avi­a­tion Oil (Sin­ga­pore) Cor­po­ra­tion on March 18.</p>
    <p>The doc­u­ment was then al­legedly used to se­cure more than US$56 mil­lion in trade fi­nanc­ing from a fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion, the po­lice said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s charge fol­lows in­ves­ti­ga­tions into Hin Leong by whitecol­lar crime agency Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment. In­ves­ti­ga­tions con­tinue into other of­fences al­legedly com­mit­ted by Lim.</p>
    <p>Abet­ment of forgery for the pur­pose of cheat­ing car­ries a jail term of up to 10 years and a fine.</p>
    <p>The next men­tion will take place on Sept 25 at 3pm.</p>
    <p>The charge against Lim came a day after the High Court ap­pointed Grant Thornton Sin­ga­pore as in­terim ju­di­cial man­agers for Xihe Hold­ings, which is owned by Lim and his son, Mr Evan Lim Chee Meng. Cred­i­tor OCBC Bank suc­cess­fully ap­plied on Aug 13 for the in­terim ju­di­cial man­agers to be ap­pointed, cit­ing strong dis­trust of the firm’s cur­rent man­age­ment after US$208.1 mil­lion (S$285.4 mil­lion) was trans­ferred by the Xihe group to Hin Leong “for no valid com­mer­cial pur­pose”.</p>
    <p>Xihe Hold­ings is the third com­pany re­lated to the Lim fam­ily to be brought un­der in­terim ju­di­cial man­age­ment fol­low­ing Hin Leong and its ship­ping arm Ocean Tankers, which came un­der full ju­di­cial man­age­ment on Aug 7.</p>
    <p>Both com­pa­nies had ini­tially sought a six-month mora­to­rium on debts of more than US$3.6 bil­lion to 23 banks but have since with­drawn this ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Hin Leong’s troubles es­ca­lated fol­low­ing a probe by the po­lice and in­creased scru­tiny by sev­eral reg­u­la­tors.</p>
    <p>This came after the el­der Mr Lim said the firm hid about US$800 mil­lion in losses in­curred from fu­tures trad­ing over the years on his or­ders. Hin Leong sold a sub­stan­tial part of the in­ven­tory it had used as col­lat­eral to se­cure loans from its banks, ac­cord­ing to fil­ings.</p>
    <p>Price­wa­ter­house-Coop­ers Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices, Hin Leong’s ju­di­cial man­agers, said it found ev­i­dence to suggest that the com­pany had suf­fered ac­cu­mu­lated de­riv­a­tives trad­ing losses of about US$808 mil­lion over the past 10 years.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Ernst & Young (EY), the j udi­cial man­agers of Ocean Tankers, have sued Lim, his son and daugh­ter, Ms Lim Huey Ching, over US$19 mil­lion al­legedly trans­ferred from Ocean Tankers’ bank ac­count to the trio’s bank ac­counts just days be­fore the com­pany filed for the debt mora­to­rium. EY said in court doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times that the sum of US$15 mil­lion al­legedly trans­ferred on April 3 to Lim and his daugh­ter was not “par­tial re­pay­ment of share­hold­ers loans” they had ex­tended to Ocean Tankers but a “gift given to (them) for no con­sid­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the US$4 mil­lion al­legedly trans­ferred on April 13 to Mr Evan Lim was also “a gift given for no con­sid­er­a­tion”. EY is seek­ing a court or­der for full resti­tu­tion of the $19 mil­lion to Ocean Tankers.</p>
