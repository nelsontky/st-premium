    <p>The char­ac­ter of Dawn Bet­ter­man in the an­i­mated fea­ture The Croods: A New Age is the pre­his­toric ver­sion of the princess in a tower.</p>
    <p>Voiced by 31-year-old Viet­namese-Amer­i­can ac­tress Kelly Marie Tran, Dawn has been kept a pris­oner from birth in her lux­u­ri­ous home by smoth­er­ing par­ents.</p>
    <p>When her tech­no­log­i­cally ad­vanced fam­ily en­coun­ters the prim­i­tive Croods, the scene is set for a clash of cul­tures in the film, a se­quel to The Croods (2013).</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times via video from Los An­ge­les, Tran talked about how she found Dawn’s voice.</p>
    <p>“I drew on her abil­ity to see the world in a new light. She’s had re­ally over­pro­tec­tive par­ents,” she says.</p>
    <p>That lack of ex­po­sure to the world, rather than mak­ing her afraid of ev­ery­thing, had the op­po­site ef­fect.</p>
    <p>“So the things the Croods have been taught to fear, Dawn is ex­cited to be ex­posed to,” she adds.</p>
    <p>Tran had been a fan of the first film, so she was over­joyed to be in­volved in the sec­ond.</p>
    <p>“The first movie made me re­ally emo­tional, I was re­ally moved by it,” says the ac­tress, who gained world at­ten­tion when she was cast as re­sis­tance fighter Rose Tico in Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017).</p>
    <p>Vis­ual jokes abound in both Croods pic­tures, with much of the hu­mour com­ing from the fic­tional an­i­mals that pop­u­late the world.</p>
    <p>Each crea­ture is a fa­mil­iar an­i­mal with a strange trait or hy­brid of two an­i­mals. In the Croods world, there are Land Sharks, Kan­gadil­los, Punch Mon­keys, Ma­cawni­vores and Wolf Spi­ders.</p>
    <p>Tran’s favourite an­i­mal in the se­quel? The Chicken Seal, a beach dweller with the head of a chicken and the body of seal, but which screams like a hu­man. “They are so funny,” she says of the lum­ber­ing, screech­ing beasts.</p>
    <p>If she had a say in the cre­ation of a Croods hy­brid, she would like to see a bi­son with a rab­bit head.</p>
    <p>Tran vis­ited Sin­ga­pore in 2017 to pro­mote The Last Jedi, dur­ing which she spoke about how pleased and for­tu­nate she felt to have been in­cluded in the Star Wars uni­verse.</p>
    <p>Right-wingers, how­ever, hated the prom­i­nent role that non-white char­ac­ters such as Tran’s Rose played in the story. They flooded her so­cial me­dia feeds with racist and sex­ist ha­rass­ment, caus­ing her to delete her In­sta­gram posts.</p>
    <p>She later penned a de­fi­ant edi­to­rial in The New York Times, say­ing how af­ter the vit­riol sent her down “a spi­ral of self-hate”, she picked her­self up and an­nounced: “I am not giv­ing up.”</p>
    <p>To­day, when asked what she thinks of the episode, she has a pre­pared an­swer.</p>
    <p>“I hon­estly feel like a bet­ter, stronger per­son for hav­ing been through that ex­pe­ri­ence. That’s how I feel about it.”</p>
    <p>• The Croods: A New Age opens in cin­e­mas to­day. See re­view on C4.</p>
