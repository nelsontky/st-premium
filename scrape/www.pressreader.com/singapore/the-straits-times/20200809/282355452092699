    <p>Writ­ing once saved Ms Ni­cole K.’s life. Now, she is us­ing it to help oth­ers.</p>
    <p>In 2011, strug­gling with ma­jor de­pres­sion and gen­er­alised anx­i­ety dis­or­der, it was pen­ning a sui­cide note that brought her back from the brink.</p>
    <p>“Writ­ing helped me de-es­ca­late my emo­tions,” says Ms K., now in her 30s, who has kept a jour­nal since her child­hood. Through­out her men­tal health jour­ney, which be­gan when she was di­ag­nosed in 2006, jour­nal­ing has helped her iden­tify trends, themes and trig­gers.</p>
    <p>Her brush with death led her to seek out a new psy­chi­a­trist, a fresh course of med­i­ca­tion and reg­u­lar ther­apy, which all helped put her on the course to re­cov­ery. For the first time in five years, she re­alised that her mind was clear.</p>
    <p>“I thought it shouldn’t have to take so long for peo­ple to get the help they need,” says Ms K., who de­clined to re­veal her sur­name.</p>
    <p>In 2014, she started men­tal health pub­li­ca­tion The Ta­pes­try Pro­ject SG, which of­fers en­cour­age­ment to peo­ple with men­tal health con­di­tions through first-per­son sto­ries.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, it in­tro­duced a new sec­tion called #Cop­ingCovid19 sto­ries, in which con­trib­u­tors share their ex­pe­ri­ences. Sto­ries cover top­ics such as par­ent­ing, fi­nan­cial stress and guilt about not feel­ing pro­duc­tive enough at home.</p>
    <p>“With so­cial dis­tanc­ing, it can get de­press­ing as I am all on my own,” writes Ms Ger­lind Quek, 40, who has bipo­lar dis­or­der and works in the funeral in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The #Cop­ingCovid19 sto­ries are among new online ini­tia­tives launched in re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers, such as online work­shops by men­tal health char­ity Clar­ity Sin­ga­pore, of­fer a safe space for peo­ple to seek help and ask ques­tions about men­tal health con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>The toll of Covid-19 goes be­yond ris­ing case num­bers and deaths. Over the past few months, psy­cho­log­i­cal ef­fects such as so­cial iso­la­tion, anx­i­ety, bore­dom and stress have emerged as peo­ple have had to adapt rapidly to the chang­ing cir­cum­stances. Here and abroad, the num­ber of calls to men­tal health hot­lines have spiked.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo Eng Chuan, founder and prin­ci­pal psy­chol­o­gist of coun­selling and psy­cho­log­i­cal pri­vate prac­tice Ca­per Spring, adds that be­ing con­fined at home can put a strain on dis­tressed ro­man­tic or fa­mil­ial re­la­tion­ships as ten­sion is com­pounded over time. Peo­ple also have fewer op­tions to help them cope, such as go­ing to work, meet­ing friends or ex­er­cis­ing, he says.</p>
    <p>And for those with men­tal health is­sues, it was a “big blow” when psy­cho­log­i­cal treat­ment was omit­ted from a list of es­sen­tial ser­vices al­lowed to op­er­ate un­der the cir­cuit breaker, says Ms K., who jug­gles free­lance writ­ing and run­ning the non-profit online pub­li­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“Our mis­sion has al­ways been to let peo­ple know they are not alone, es­pe­cially now when peo­ple are be­hind closed doors. I hope the sto­ries will re­as­sure peo­ple that it is okay to strug­gle dur­ing this time,” she adds.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, staff at Clar­ity Sin­ga­pore, which also runs youth plat­form The Yes Ini­tia­tive, have also adapted swiftly over the past few months, tak­ing ex­ist­ing pro­grammes online and even launch­ing new ones.</p>
    <p>In April, mid­way through a free eight-week pro­gramme for youth with men­tal health con­di­tions called Pro­ject Bloom, fa­cil­i­ta­tors shifted the pro­gramme online to com­ply with cir­cuit breaker mea­sures.</p>
    <p>And in May, they moved twiceyearl­y in-per­son men­tal health work­shops online and in­creased their fre­quency to once a month.</p>
    <p>These work­shops, which pre­vi­ously cost $15 for an in­tro­duc­tory ses­sion and three small-group ses­sions, used to see 15 to 30 peo­ple each time.</p>
    <p>Now, the free 90-minute ses­sions at­tract be­tween 40 and 70 par­tic­i­pants. Ses­sions tar­get those with men­tal health con­di­tions – such as ob­ses­sive-com­pul­sive dis­or­der (OCD), anx­i­ety and de­pres­sion – as well as their care­givers.</p>
    <p>“We want to reach out to peo­ple who are hes­i­tant about seek­ing help when it comes to men­tal health. Online, it is less in­tim­i­dat­ing as peo­ple can ask ques­tions in the chat box and don’t have to show their faces in the video,” says in­ter­ven­tion pro­grammes man­ager Re­becca Oh.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess of ven­tur­ing online has sparked new ex­per­i­ments, such as pi­lot­ing a new pro­gramme for those suf­fer­ing from skin-re­lated men­tal health is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ms Oh ex­plains that there is a link be­tween con­di­tions such as eczema and acne, and men­tal well­ness. Suf­fer­ers may have trou­ble sleep­ing or lack the con­fi­dence to go to school.</p>
    <p>“We heard feed­back that there aren’t any av­enues for such spe­cialised sup­port in Sin­ga­pore and want to plug this gap,” she says, adding that the or­gan­i­sa­tion in­tends to run the work­shop on a re­cur­ring ba­sis.</p>
    <p>Down the line, they want to of­fer both online and off­line pro­grammes to con­tinue pro­vid­ing ac­ces­si­ble help to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the prac­ti­cal help they can of­fer, these men­tal health ad­vo­cates agree that online plat­forms are a way to re­duce stigma sur­round­ing var­i­ous con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms K. says: “Shar­ing sto­ries em­pow­ers the writ­ers and lets peo­ple see them as more than their con­di­tion. This not only pro­motes em­pa­thy, but also bridges the gap be­tween them and so­ci­ety at large.”</p>
