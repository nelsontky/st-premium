    <p>New Ja­pa­nese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s choice of de­fence min­is­ter and a meet­ing of the Quadri­lat­eral Di­a­logue as his first di­plo­matic ini­tia­tive are among the early signs of how he will go about pro­tect­ing his coun­try’s se­cu­rity in­ter­ests in these un­cer­tain times, says as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Ravi Vel­loor.</p>
    <p>His­tory’s wheels turn, and turn again. Four years ago, Mr Don­ald Trump’s stun­ning suc­cess in as­cend­ing to the pres­i­dency of the United States led then Ja­pa­nese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe to scram­ble a meet­ing with the Pres­i­dent-elect in New York’s Trump Tower – an early en­counter that would even­tu­ally pro­duce solid re­sults for Ja­pan over the Pres­i­dent’s four years in of­fice.</p>
    <p>Now, just when Asia thought it fi­nally had the mea­sure of the man, and he, theirs, Mr Trump is wob­bling on his White House perch.</p>
    <p>At the other end of the Pa­cific, Ja­pan has just had an un­ex­pected change of prime min­is­ter. The new leader, Mr Yoshi­hide Suga, was a loyal aide and coun­sel­lor to Mr Abe for seven years and eight months, help­ing mid­wife some of the ini­tia­tives spawned by post-war Ja­pan’s most durable leader.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, dif­fer­ences in nu­ances are in­evitable, per­haps. Af­ter Mr Abe left of­fice ow­ing to poor health in 2007, his suc­ces­sor Ya­suo Fukuda was no­tice­ably cool to some of Mr Abe’s ini­tia­tives. Could that bit of his­tory be re­peated?</p>
    <p>What­ever the rip­ple ef­fects of the power han­dover from Mr Abe to Mr Suga, the swells across the Indo-Pa­cific are fur­row­ing brows in Tokyo, Tai­wan, Manila, Hanoi, New Delhi and sev­eral other Asian cap­i­tals. Those in Asia who cal­cu­lated that the US had their backs strate­gi­cally, never mind the dis­dain for hith­erto sacro­sanct de­fence and trade pacts, are rac­ing to redo their sums on the more than even chance of a Joe Biden pres­i­dency and mem­o­ries of Mr</p>
    <p>Barack Obama’s less-than-firm ap­proach to­wards Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton, too, is sep­a­rately watch­ing events and for its own rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Tokyo’s bu­reau­crats have al­ways had more power than many of their Asian coun­ter­parts be­cause, in ad­di­tion to be­ing the steel frame of govern­ment, they’ve of­ten sur­prised with dashes of cre­ativ­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe’s de­ci­sion to di­vert from his trip to Lima, Peru, for the Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion sum­mit and make an un­sched­uled stop in New York to see Pres­i­dent-elect Trump was at their ad­vice. So, too, the thrust on the Indo-Pa­cific, and specif­i­cally, the “free and open” for­mu­la­tion that pre­cedes the phrase, which floated up from the drab of­fices of Ja­pan’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>THE QUAD</p>
    <p>Now, they’ve once again stepped in to help their po­lit­i­cal masters sig­nal con­ti­nu­ity; last Fri­day, they or­gan­ised a meet­ing of se­nior of­fi­cials from the Quadri­lat­eral Di­a­logue – a steadily co­a­lesc­ing group­ing led by Ja­pan that in­cludes the US, Aus­tralia and In­dia, and is viewed with sus­pi­cion in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga’s first ma­jor di­plo­matic ini­tia­tive is the meet­ing of Quad for­eign min­is­ters he is host­ing in Tokyo next Tues­day, and there are strong in­di­ca­tions that his first over­seas trip as prime min­is­ter could be to Viet­nam, which Tokyo has been as­sid­u­ously woo­ing for years as it seeks re­li­able part­ners to bal­ance China.</p>
    <p>In­deed, when Hanoi opened an in­ter­na­tional port in Cam Ranh Bay in 2016, Ja­pan swiftly sent in two guided mis­sile de­stroy­ers for a port call – ahead of even the US.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, the ap­point­ment of Mr Abe’s younger brother, Mr Nobuo Kishi, as de­fence min­is­ter also sends out an un­mis­tak­able state­ment of in­tent. Mr Kishi has close ties with Tai­wan, and he has of­ten talked about bol­ster­ing tri­lat­eral ties be­tween Ja­pan, the US and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>He steps into a job va­cated by a pre­de­ces­sor whose part­ing words in of­fice were to warn that “China has be­come a se­cu­rity threat to Ja­pan... they have ca­pa­bil­ity, and in­tent”.</p>
    <p>Lit­tle sur­prise, there­fore, that Mr Kishi him­self has spo­ken of the im­por­tance of the US re­la­tion­ship reach­ing “an un­prece­dented level” be­cause of the “in­creas­ingly harsh se­cu­rity en­vi­ron­ment”.</p>
    <p>Those who know Ja­pan say there was never an Abe for­eign pol­icy as much as an Abe-Suga for­eign pol­icy, given that ev­ery pa­per seen by Mr Abe went through Mr Suga’s of­fice. In­deed, Mr Suga seems de­ter­mined to stay the Abe line of main­tain­ing a cor­rect but cool re­la­tion­ship with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>XI SUM­MIT</p>
    <p>It would not have been missed in China that days af­ter tak­ing of­fice, Mr Suga pri­ori­tised calls to Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son, Mr Trump and In­dia’s Naren­dra Modi, be­fore speak­ing with Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi is thought to be keen on a sum­mit with Ja­pan as a di­plo­matic re­lease valve amid his coun­try’s ten­sions with sev­eral world pow­ers. This month, it is send­ing For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi to Tokyo, and some ob­servers sug­gest that a more se­nior per­son like Mr Yang Jiechi would have made that trip if Bei­jing had more con­fi­dence about se­cur­ing a sum­mit for Mr Xi with Mr Suga.</p>
    <p>In­deed, while Bei­jing made no ref­er­ence to a Xi visit to Tokyo in its an­nounce­ments, it was Mr Suga who let re­porters know that a state visit from Mr Xi, ini­tially slated for April this year, was not dis­cussed in their con­ver­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, it is near-cer­tain that un­der Mr Suga and De­fence Min­is­ter Kishi, Ja­pan will travel fur­ther along the road of “nor­mal­i­sa­tion” of its mil­i­tary.</p>
    <p>UM­BRELLA WOR­RIES</p>
    <p>Un­stated, but redo­lent in Ja­pan’s plan­ning is the “what if the US de­fence um­brella is with­drawn” fear that seeps through the coun­try’s power elite.</p>
    <p>Since the peace­time Con­sti­tu­tion was drafted, the US and Ja­pan have had a “shield and spear” re­la­tion­ship: The US un­der­writes Ja­pa­nese se­cu­rity with a nu­clear shield and strate­gic of­fen­sive ca­pa­bil­i­ties; Ja­pan’s role is sea con­trol in near waters and the pro­tec­tion of US forces in and around Ja­pan, and na­tional de­fence.</p>
    <p>That re­la­tion­ship has been chang­ing in the past three years and, urged on by the US, is poised for a dra­matic trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Kishi now talks of hit­ting at threats where they re­side and he has said that Ja­pan must “think com­pre­hen­sively” about whether to ac­quire enemy base strike ca­pa­bil­i­ties as a form of de­fence – short form for build­ing in­ter­me­di­ate-range bal­lis­tic mis­siles.</p>
    <p>Al­though there is no talk of go­ing nu­clear, for now, it is well known that Ja­pan is only a few turns of the screw­driver away from build­ing atomic weapons, should it ever need to.</p>
    <p>Other mid­dle pow­ers in the re­gion are scram­bling as well in a way that sug­gests they are hedg­ing their bets on a con­tin­ued res­o­lute US pres­ence in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Last month, Aus­tralia, In­dia and France held their in­au­gu­ral tri­lat­eral meet­ing at the level of se­nior of­fi­cials. France, which has a base in the United Arab Emi­rates and in New Cale­do­nia, and a vast ex­clu­sive eco­nomic zone in the Pa­cific, aside from own­ing Re­union Is­land in the In­dian Ocean, is pro­ject­ing it­self in the re­gion as a cred­i­ble force.</p>
    <p>Last year, it pub­lished an Indo-Pa­cific de­fence strat­egy call­ing for in­creased co­op­er­a­tion with the US, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and In­dia. Ja­pan and France con­ducted anti-piracy ex­er­cises off the coast of Aden in March this year, and their for­eign and de­fence min­is­ters have been in reg­u­lar talks. Ger­many, too, has an Indo-Pa­cific strat­egy in place as of Sept 3, the sec­ond Euro­pean power to an­nounce such a plan.</p>
    <p>The Western book­end of the Indo-Pa­cific, In­dia, is par­tic­u­larly warm to­wards France, see­ing a clear-eyed power that has not much of a re­la­tion­ship with arch-ri­val Pak­istan, while sup­port­ing New Delhi with high tech­nol­ogy in ways that even the US is not will­ing.</p>
    <p>IN­DIA TIES</p>
    <p>One Asian na­tion that will miss Mr Abe more than most is In­dia. Mr Abe’s out­reach to New Delhi, which de­lighted In­di­ans, was a high point of his Asian diplo­macy.</p>
    <p>In­deed, given the his­tor­i­cal past of the two na­tions, it is re­mark­able to no­tice how dif­fer­ently In­di­ans re­act to Ja­pan com­pared with China, given that Ja­pan oc­cu­pied the An­daman and Ni­co­bar is­lands in World War II and, as in South-east Asia, in­flicted hard­ship on the lo­cal pop­u­la­tion. On the other hand, China with­drew to be­hind its claim lines af­ter their brief bor­der war in 1962.</p>
    <p>Yet, while the China ex­pe­ri­ence is seared on In­dian pub­lic con­scious­ness, the Ja­pa­nese ex­pe­ri­ence is not, pos­si­bly be­cause the An­daman is­lands are so dis­tant from the main­land and also be­cause, un­like China, Ja­pan has no ter­ri­to­rial is­sues with In­dia.</p>
    <p>This week, the Ja­pa­nese and In­dian navies con­ducted war games in the Ara­bian Sea – their 16th in three years – with the Ja­pa­nese sail­ing in the he­li­copter car­rier Kaga, soon to be mod­i­fied to host US-built F-35s. Their pre­vi­ous joint ex­er­cise was held just in June, in the In­dian Ocean, co­in­cid­ing with a time when the In­dian and Chi­nese armies were fac­ing off in the Ladakh Hi­malayas.</p>
    <p>Vice-Ad­mi­ral Pradeep Chauhan, head of In­dia’s Na­tional Mar­itime Foun­da­tion, said at the time that the war games were meant not so much for com­bat as strate­gic sig­nalling. “We need to be prox­i­mate with our friends, and the Chi­nese know there is a di­rect lad­der of es­ca­la­tion be­tween Ja­pan and the United States,” he was quoted say­ing.</p>
    <p>While Asian lead­ers may think they have seen enough to be san­guine about pol­icy con­ti­nu­ity in Mr Suga’s Ja­pan, they’ll nev­er­the­less be pay­ing care­ful at­ten­tion to his dura­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan, like Aus­tralia in re­cent times, has tended to have re­volv­ing-door prime min­is­ters. While this trend was checked since Mr Abe re­turned to power in 2012, it re­mains to be seen if Mr Suga, cur­rently en­joy­ing high rat­ings at home, will be equally re­silient.</p>
    <p>For now, it does look as though he should have no trou­ble serv­ing out the re­main­der of the Diet’s cur­rent term, and per­haps win­ning elec­tions to serve for at least another three years sub­se­quently.</p>
    <p>With that is­sue put away, it is prob­a­bly time to turn all eyes to­wards Wash­ing­ton and the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion for Asia to feel the next stone un­der­foot in the wa­ter.</p>
