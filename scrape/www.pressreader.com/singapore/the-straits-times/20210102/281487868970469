    <p>• No HSR, but lit­tle change to other plans for Jurong: Ex­perts</p>
    <p>• How Covid-19 killed the KL-Sin­ga­pore project</p>
    <p>• Ma­jor­ity of 80 staff af­fected will re­main in roles at LTA</p>
    <p>The ax­ing of the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore High Speed Rail (HSR) will have no im­me­di­ate bear­ing on de­vel­op­ment plans for the Jurong re­gion, which was slated to host the project’s south­ern­most ter­mi­nus, ex­perts said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Jurong’s sta­tus as the eco­nomic and so­cial cen­tre in the west pre­dated the HSR and will sur­vive it, said Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences’ as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of eco­nomics Wal­ter Th­e­seira.</p>
    <p>He said: “I be­lieve our plans to con­tinue de­vel­op­ing the Jurong re­gion re­main un­changed; they were not con­tin­gent on the HSR be­ing built.”</p>
    <p>The 350km line would have run from a ter­mi­nal sta­tion in Ban­dar Malaysia, down­town Kuala Lumpur, to a ter­mi­nal in Sin­ga­pore’s western Jurong area.</p>
    <p>The sur­round­ing Jurong Lake Dis­trict was po­si­tioned, in 2017, as Sin­ga­pore’s fu­ture se­cond Cen­tral Busi­ness Dis­trict (CBD), with an am­bi­tious 20-year blue­print for com­mer­cial, hous­ing, na­ture and trans­port de­vel­op­ments, along with the po­ten­tial for cre­at­ing some 100,000 new jobs.</p>
    <p>Two years later, the Govern­ment an­nounced that the dis­trict would in­clude a new 7ha in­te­grated tourism de­vel­op­ment from 2026.</p>
    <p>Flex­i­bil­ity was worked into plans for the dis­trict, to cater for chang­ing cir­cum­stances such as this, said the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Ray­mond Ong, who re­searches trans­port in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>“So the land that was ac­quired for the HSR can eas­ily be re­con­fig­ured or re­de­ployed to align with the long-term vi­sion of the re­gion.”</p>
    <p>Prof Th­e­seira said that Sin­ga­pore could wait and see how Malaysia pro­gresses with re­ported plans to con­tinue with a do­mes­tic, “down­graded” ver­sion of the HSR con­nect­ing KL to Johor Baru.</p>
    <p>“(If) there is a re­al­is­tic prospect that the sys­tem could be ex­tended to Sin­ga­pore and pro­vide the same qual­ity of ser­vice be­tween Sin­ga­pore and KL as orig­i­nally planned... then we could al­ways hold the land in re­serve, or lease it</p>
    <p>out on a short-term ba­sis,” he said. “(Other­wise) we should just pro­ceed with longer-term re­de­vel­op­ment with the land.”</p>
    <p>Mr Har­ri­son Cheng, as­so­ciate di­rec­tor of con­sul­tancy Con­trol Risks, said the sil­ver lin­ing was that the JB-Sin­ga­pore Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem (RTS) Link rail shut­tle ser­vice re­mains on track.</p>
    <p>The first civil con­tract for its con­struc­tion was awarded in Novem­ber last year, with the se­cond due in the first quar­ter of this year. The RTS Link should be op­er­a­tional by end-2026.</p>
    <p>“There is much stronger con­sen</p>
    <p>sus in Pu­tra­jaya, Johor and Sin­ga­pore to im­ple­ment this in time… HSR, by com­par­i­son, was far more con­tentious a propo­si­tion since Na­jib fell,” said Mr Cheng.</p>
    <p>For­mer Malaysian prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak presided over the sign­ing of the HSR agree­ment with Sin­ga­pore in 2016.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore MP Sak­tiandi Su­paat, who chairs the Govern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Trans­port, still looks for­ward to fu­ture con­nec­tiv­ity ini­tia­tives be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“The eco­nomic and ag­glom­er­a­tion ef­fects are huge be­tween</p>
    <p>cities in Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheng said that the aborted project was un­likely to al­ter the tenor of bi­lat­eral re­la­tions be­tween the Cause­way neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>“The only change is that Sin­ga­pore is go­ing to be warier of get­ting into bi­lat­eral projects, given not just the eco­nomic con­di­tions caused by Covid-19, but im­por­tantly the po­lit­i­cal risk over the bor­der… Changes in govern­ment in Malaysia tend to trig­ger con­tract risks.”</p>
