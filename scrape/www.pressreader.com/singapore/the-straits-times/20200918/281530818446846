    <p>Much can – and, in fact, must – be done to­day to stop the spread of Covid-19, be­fore the ad­vent of a vi­able vac­cine, said sev­eral ex­perts from around the world.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine’s fi­nal Covid-19 we­bi­nar last night, they raised con­cerns that even when an ef­fec­tive vac­cine emerges, there will not be enough for every­one, given the lim­ited pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity in the world to­day.</p>
    <p>In­stead, coun­tries that have more suc­cess­fully re­duced trans­mis­sion have shown that if every­one does his part, the dis­ease can be con­tained – and this will remain the most ef­fec­tive strat­egy for some time to come.</p>
    <p>The ex­perts, led by World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion head Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus, also spoke of the need for global co­op­er­a­tion to over­come the pan­demic that has im­pacted not just health, but also the econ­omy and peo­ple’s liveli­hood.</p>
    <p>They lauded the way sci­en­tists and doc­tors around the world have been shar­ing their re­search and dis­cov­er­ies, and done so at “un­prece­dented speed”.</p>
    <p>Said Pro­fes­sor Chong Yap Seng, dean of the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore: “To sur­vive in the short term, we need na­tional sol­i­dar­ity. But to sur­vive in the long term, we need global sol­i­dar­ity.”</p>
    <p>The head of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) has de­bunked ar­gu­ments that coun­tries have to choose be­tween pub­lic health and the econ­omy when they look at whether to ease re­stric­tions fol­low­ing a lock­down.</p>
    <p>“That is a false choice,” said WHO direc­tor-gen­eral Te­dros Ad­hanom Ghe­breye­sus. In­stead, the WHO urges coun­tries to fo­cus on four es­sen­tial pri­or­i­ties:</p>
    <p>• Prevent Covid-19 am­pli­fy­ing events: All around the world, ex­plo­sive out­breaks have been linked to gath­er­ings, in places like sta­di­ums, night­clubs and places of wor­ship.</p>
    <p>• Pro­tect the vul­ner­a­ble to save lives and re­duce the bur­den on the health sys­tems in terms of se­verely and crit­i­cally ill patients.</p>
    <p>• Ed­u­cate and em­power com­mu­ni­ties to pro­tect them­selves and oth­ers. Phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing, hand hy­giene, res­pi­ra­tory eti­quette and masks can help to curb trans­mis­sion and save lives. Not when done in iso­la­tion, but by prac­tis­ing all the mea­sures to­gether.</p>
    <p>• Per­sist with the pub­lic health ba­sics. Find, iso­late, test and care for peo­ple who have been in­fected, and trace and quar­an­tine their con­tacts.</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros said there are many coun­tries that have “ef­fec­tively pre­vented or con­trolled their out­breaks by do­ing these four things and do­ing them well”, and named Sin­ga­pore and New Zealand as two such places.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine’s fi­nal Covid-19 we­bi­nar yes­ter­day, which looked at global sol­i­dar­ity. The ses­sion fea­tured 16 speak­ers.</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros said the pan­demic has changed the world. “Lives and liveli­hoods have been lost, and economies and so­ci­eties have been up­ended. The pan­demic has ex­posed and ex­ploited po­lit­i­cal fault lines and in­equal­i­ties and the gaps in na­tional health sys­tems.”</p>
    <p>But on a more pos­i­tive note, he said for ev­ery­thing Covid-19 has taken from us, it has also given us some­thing – a re­minder of what re­ally mat­ters and the op­por­tu­nity to forge a com­mon fu­ture.</p>
    <p>The real ques­tion is whether coun­tries can come to­gether in sol­i­dar­ity to share the fruits of re­search when a vi­able vac­cine is avail­able.</p>
    <p>“Or, will mis­guided na­tion­al­ism re­in­force the in­equal­i­ties and in­jus­tices that have blighted our world for so long?” he asked. “In our in­ter-con­nected world, if peo­ple in low- and mid­dle-in­come coun­tries miss out on vac­cines, the virus will con­tinue to kill and the eco­nomic re­cov­ery, glob­ally, will be de­layed.”</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros said: “The virus thrives on di­vi­sion. But united, we can de­feat it. The pan­demic has re­minded us of a sim­ple truth – that for all our dif­fer­ences, we are one hu­man race and we are stronger to­gether.”</p>
    <p>In April, the WHO, to­gether with the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion and France, set up the Co­vax ini­tia­tive to pro­vide eq­ui­table ac­cess to vac­cines against Covid-19. More than 170 coun­tries in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore have since joined. They will be guar­an­teed ac­cess to the world’s largest port­fo­lio of vac­cine can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Dr Te­dros said: “The first vac­cine to be ap­proved may not be the best. The more shots on goal we have, the higher the chances of hav­ing a very safe, very ef­fi­ca­cious vac­cine.”</p>
