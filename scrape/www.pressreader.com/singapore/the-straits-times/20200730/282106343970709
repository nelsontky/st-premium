    <p>Like many among the young grap­pling with the new nor­mal from Covid-19, Ms Sarah An­nuar is up­set and wracked with worry.</p>
    <p>“My anx­i­ety and stress lev­els rose high. A-Lev­els is seven months away,” says Ms An­nuar, 21, in a let­ter on May 31.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to Covid-19, she writes: “You took my pre­cious time study­ing in school, hav­ing con­sul­ta­tions and the abil­ity to meet up with friends. “How dare you?”</p>
    <p>A fi­nal year stu­dent at Mil­len­nia In­sti­tute, Ms An­nuar was ex­press­ing her ini­tial dif­fi­cul­ties with the tran­si­tion to home-based learn­ing as she pre­pares for the ex­ams.</p>
    <p>In an­other let­ter on May 14, free­lance em­cee El­son Leong, 30, re­counts the im­pact on his liveli­hood when the Dis­ease Out­break Re­sponse Sys­tem Con­di­tion level was raised to orange in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“That hit the brakes on al­most all my gigs. I was em­cee­ing a Chi­nese New Year cel­e­bra­tion for a Ger­man com­pany by the Sin­ga­pore River that very night. That was my very last ‘live’ event since.” “I was frus­trated.”</p>
    <p>Mr Leong, who is also a sports coach de­velop</p>
    <p>Young Sin­ga­pore­ans are step­ping for­ward — both for them­selves and for oth­ers — to make the best of a chal­leng­ing sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­cent poll find­ings show that youth are pre­pared to take tougher em­ploy­ment op­tions and lower their ex­pec­ta­tions. A ma­jor­ity (95 per cent) of the young polled in a Na­tional Youth Sur­vey by the NYC felt that it was an im­por­tant life goal to ac­quire new skills and knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>In an­other study, the NYC-Mil­lieu Sen­ti­ment Poll on the Eco­nomic Sit­u­a­tion found that 92 per cent of youth were prag­matic and are will­ing to con­sider a va­ri­ety of al­ter­na­tives, should their cur­rent em­ploy­ment or em­ploy­ment prospects be af­fected.</p>
    <p>Fully 45 per cent said they are open to pick­ing up new skills dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic such as dig­i­tal skills and data an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>Life fi­nally seemed to be com­ing to­gether for Ms Grace Ke, 29.</p>
    <p>Within the past year, Ms Ke started her own cloth­ing busi­ness, got mar­ried and be­came a proud home­owner of a four-room Hous­ing Board flat.</p>
    <p>She worked in the ad­ver­tis­ing in­dus­try for six years be­fore leav­ing last year to start Lunch­money, a women’s cloth­ing busi­ness that in­cor­po­rated pock­ets in their de­signs.</p>
    <p>“I felt un­ful­filled in ad­ver­tis­ing as a lot of my work wasn’t tan­gi­ble and the work­ing en­vi­ron­ment made me very anx­ious.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “I wanted more con­trol over my time, and I also wanted to be able to tan­gi­bly know that I cre­ated some­thing.”</p>
    <p>When Covid-19 struck in Jan­uary, her fledg­ling busi­ness took a hit. Her sup­ple­men­tary in­come streams from be­ing a free­lance de­signer and box­ing coach were also af­fected.</p>
    <p>But in­stead of de­spair, she felt lib­er­ated. “I de­cided then and there that for the first time in my life, I didn’t need to sell X num­ber of dresses or clock Y num­ber of hours to val­i­date my­self.”</p>
    <p>She turned her at­ten­tion to help­ing those fac­ing a more dire sit­u­a­tion and started de­sign­ing er and per­sonal de­vel­op­ment trainer, had no in­come in Fe­bru­ary and March.</p>
    <p>The let­ters are just two of over 700 sub­mis­sions to Dear Covid-19 (dearcovid1­9sg.com), a na­tion­wide mem­ory project that sheds light on ev­ery­day life dur­ing Covid-19. Young Sin­ga­pore­ans are be­ing asked to share their ex­pe­ri­ences through user sub­mis­sions in dif­fer­ent for­mats such as photos, po­ems, songs and let­ters to pre­serve this his­toric mo­ment in time.</p>
    <p>Launched in May, the ini­tia­tive was con­cep­tu­alised by the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil (NYC) in part­ner­ship with Sin­ga­pore-based mar­ket­ing agency DSTNCT.</p>
    <p>While the anx­i­ety re­flected in the re­sponses is un­der­stand­able, there has also been a strong streak of the can-do spirit.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong, for ex­am­ple, got back on his feet by con­duct­ing on­line talk shows and work­out pro­grammes, and even de­liv­er­ing parcels to bol­ster his in­come.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong is grate­ful for the op­por­tu­ni­ties de­spite earn­ing only 20 per cent of the in­come he drew be­fore Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Though the in­come is far from what is usual, I am thank­ful that I have some work to do.” and sell­ing her own masks with a dual ob­jec­tive — to seize a new op­por­tu­nity and help so­ci­ety while do­ing so.</p>
    <p>Along with a busi­ness part­ner, Ms Ke started Satki (satki­masks.com) — hand­crafted masks that are stylish and com­fort­able. A por­tion of its sales — 10 per cent — goes to Over the Rain­bow, an ini­tia­tive that pro­vides sup­port for youth men­tal well­ness.</p>
    <p>“Satki has given me mean­ing to my days. I don’t work a tra­di­tional job any­more, and be­ing able to com­mit my­self into cre­at­ing an im­proved ver­sion of what has now be­come a ne­ces­sity, while be­ing able to give back to the com­mu­nity has meant the world.”</p>
    <p>For 29-year-old Ruzaini Syazwan, this past Ra­madan was ex­cep­tion­ally chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>The first-year Nanyang Polytech­nic stu­dent would spend his day in front of his com­puter at­tend­ing lessons on­line, be­fore head­ing out in the evening on his motorcycle to de­liver food to the home­less across Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>To curb the spread of the coron­avirus, the Is­lamic Re­li­gious Coun­cil of Sin­ga­pore closed all mosques on March 24. This meant that the home­less could no longer re­ceive the meals pro­vided by the mosques for the break­ing of fast.</p>
    <p>Trou­bled by this, Mr Syazwan de­cided that he would per­son­ally de­liver pack­ets of food to them, and ap­pealed for do­na­tions via his per­sonal Instagram ac­count (instagram.com/r.syaz1).</p>
    <p>This evolved into the Um­brella Ini­tia­tive, which by the third week of Ra­madan, had grown into a 30-man op­er­a­tion that de­liv­ered close to 500 meals to the home­less and un­der­priv­i­leged fam­i­lies daily till the end of Ra­madan.</p>
    <p>“To­wards the end of Ra­madan, I was re­ally stretched,” he says, about jug­gling school work and man­ag­ing the food de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>“But when you’ve been do­ing it for two to three weeks, peo­ple start to recog­nise you and the thought of them wait­ing for food kept me go­ing.”</p>
    <p>In sup­port­ing youth through Covid-19, the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil is spear­head­ing ef­forts with a host of pro­grammes and ini­tia­tives, from per­sonal de­vel­op­ment to get­ting in­volved in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Geared to­wards mak­ing a so­cial im­pact, the in­tern­ship scheme pro­vides youth with the op­por­tu­nity to gain in­sights on so­cial is­sues and in­dus­try ex­pe­ri­ence in the com­mu­nity and so­cial sec­tor, along with vol­un­teer­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
