    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United man­ager Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer has hinted at a new po­si­tion for Donny van de Beek, af­ter the mid­fielder shone as the Red Devils beat Brighton 3-0 away on Wed­nes­day to book a place in the League Cup quar­ter-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>United earned their sec­ond win over Brighton in five days but it was a much more com­fort­able vic­tory than Satur­day’s dra­matic last-gasp 3-2 Premier League tri­umph.</p>
    <p>Scott McTom­i­nay headed in the opener shortly be­fore half-time be­fore Juan Mata and sub­sti­tute Paul Pogba scored in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>For­mer Ajax man van de Beek, signed for £40 mil­lion (S$70.7 mil­lion) in the cur­rent trans­fer win­dow, started the match in the mid­dle of mid­field, but fre­quently drifted out to the left. When left winger Daniel James was sub­sti­tuted with 20 min­utes left, the Dutch­man was then moved out to the flank, with Pogba as­sum­ing cen­tral mid­field re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>United fans had been won­der­ing how Sol­sk­jaer would fit van de</p>
    <p>Beek – who as­sisted Mata’s goal – along­side Pogba and Bruno Fer­nan­des and the man­ager could have pro­vided a so­lu­tion on ac­count of Wed­nes­day’s show­ing.</p>
    <p>He said of the 23-year-old: “He’s got very high foot­balling in­tel­li­gence and tac­ti­cally he’s gone through the Ajax sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Dutch foot­ball is tac­ti­cal – he knows foot­ball, he’s got his head screwed on.</p>
    <p>“He’s a dif­fer­ent type of left­sided player com­pared to Dan James and Mar­cus Rash­ford, but com­ing in­side and find­ing good pock­ets, why not?”</p>
    <p>Sol­sk­jaer added that van de Beek’s ver­sa­til­ity would be a plus for his team se­lec­tion this sea­son.</p>
    <p>“He can play loads of dif­fer­ent po­si­tions, which some­times is a strength for a player,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Donny is one the coach will al­ways look to have in a squad.”</p>
    <p>The United boss made 10 changes to the team that started at the week­end, with Sun­day’s Premier League home clash against Tot­ten­ham Hot­spur in mind.</p>
    <p>Cen­tre-back Vic­tor Lin­de­lof was the only player to keep his place, and al­though United strug­gled for flu­ency, they were too strong for a sec­ond-string Brighton side.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Fer­ran Tor­res scored his first Manch­ester City goal as the League Cup hold­ers got back on track with a 3-0 win against Burn­ley.</p>
    <p>Pep Guardi­ola’s side suf­fered their heav­i­est home Premier League loss un­der the Spa­niard on Sun­day when Le­ices­ter handed them a hu­mil­i­at­ing 5-2 de­feat.</p>
    <p>A brace from Ra­heem Ster­ling at Turf Moor en­sured they washed away some of that bit­ter taste from that de­feat and Span­ish for­ward Tor­res, a close-sea­son sign­ing from Va­len­cia, added City’s third goal.</p>
