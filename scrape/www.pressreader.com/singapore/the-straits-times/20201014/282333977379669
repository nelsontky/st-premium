    <p>•</p>
    <p>WELLINGTON New Zealand Rugby (NZR) is ex­pect­ing a “nearca­pac­ity” crowd of some 47,000 to pack into Auck­land’s Eden Park for the sec­ond Bledis­loe Cup in­ter­na­tional against Aus­tralia on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>Pic­tures of 31,000 fans with­out masks cheer­ing on the three-time world cham­pi­ons in the first Test in Wellington last Sun­day at­tracted plenty of at­ten­tion on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The envy from fans in coun­tries where sports con­tinue to be played in empty sta­di­ums will only be ex­ac­er­bated on Sun­day when the All Blacks re­turn to their spir­i­tual home, where they are un­beaten in 43 matches go­ing back to 1994.</p>
    <p>The bumper turnout is pos­si­ble be­cause of New Zealand’s rel­a­tive suc­cess in com­bat­ing Covid-19, hav­ing ap­peared to have stamped out com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion of the coro­n­avirus ear­lier this year fol­low­ing a tough na­tion­wide lock­down.</p>
    <p>A re­newed out­break in Auck­land in Au­gust was also brought un­der con­trol with fresh lock­down mea­sures and NZR said yesterday that 40,000 tick­ets for Sun­day’s match had al­ready been snapped up.</p>
    <p>“It was fan­tas­tic to see so many fans come to­gether in Wellington for (our) first Test in more than a year, and af­ter such an en­thralling con­test, in­ter­est has gone to another level,” NZR’s Chris Len­drum said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“We are now look­ing for­ward to bring­ing Test rugby to New Zealand’s largest city and with more than 40,000 tick­ets sold, it’s shap­ing as a spe­cial oc­ca­sion.”</p>
    <p>Last Sun­day’s ex­cit­ing 16-16 draw was the first rugby union Test af­ter a seven-month hia­tus caused by the pan­demic but fans Down Un­der have plenty more to look for­ward to over the next cou­ple of months.</p>
    <p>The Rugby Cham­pi­onship, which in­volves the trans-Tas­man ri­vals as well as world cham­pi­ons South Africa and Ar­gentina, will be hosted in Aus­tralia, start­ing with the third Bledis­loe Cup Test at Sydney’s Olympic Sta­dium on Oct 31.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment of the state of New South Wales, where com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion has been re­duced to a hand­ful of cases each day, loos­ened re­stric­tions on big sta­di­ums from Oct 1 to al­low them to be filled to 50 per cent of ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>That means the three Tests at the Olympic Sta­dium could be played in front of crowds of 40,000, while the Western Sydney Sta­dium will be able to wel­come 15,000 fans to the four matches it will stage.</p>
