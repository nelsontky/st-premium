    <p>Does your bank know how you spend your money?</p>
    <p>If the an­swer is no, then make sure you say just that if some­one calls you to tell you that your ac­count has been com­pro­mised.</p>
    <p>Chances are that any­one who calls with that sort of mes­sage is likely to be a crook be­cause banks are not in the busi­ness of mak­ing such checks on cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>If you are in doubt, hang up and call your bank on its hotline.</p>
    <p>De­spite count­less re­minders by the au­thor­i­ties, an in­creas­ing num­ber of peo­ple here con­tinue to fall prey to crooks mak­ing cold calls to them at home.</p>
    <p>It in­di­cates that many peo­ple as­sume wrongly that some­how ei­ther the au­thor­i­ties or their banks are con­stantly watch­ing over them and that some­one will call them if some­thing is wrong with their ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The re­al­ity is no one is watch­ing out for you and that you are the only de­fence against crooks. Here are some re­al­ity checks to help you watch your back.</p>
    <p>Banks need your help to pro­tect you. It is not only im­pos­si­ble for banks to watch over all their cus­tomers, it is also wrong for them to spy on them.</p>
    <p>Banks will also not know whom you are deal­ing with and what you are buy­ing. This means that they will not stop any trans­ac­tion un­less you tell them to.</p>
    <p>It also means that if you use your credit card to buy from a fake site, the bank won’t know un­less you lodge a re­port.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the bank can’t stop you if you choose to trans­fer money to strangers who turn out to be crooks.</p>
    <p>Mr Vin­cent Tan, OCBC Bank’s head of cards busi­ness, warns that cus­tomers can be li­able for losses if they make it easy for crooks to cheat them by be­ing lax on se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>This can in­clude:</p>
    <p>• Vol­un­tar­ily giv­ing strangers your pass­word or the one-time au­then­ti­ca­tion code that is sent to your reg­is­tered phone; • Be­ing neg­li­gent in safe­guard­ing your phys­i­cal credit cards and card de­tails; and</p>
    <p>• Tak­ing more than 120 days to</p>
    <p>re­port a fraud­u­lent trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Take great care of your credit cards. De­pend­ing on your credit limit, cards can eas­ily en­ti­tle the user to spend up to $60,000 or more on each card. So if you carry five cards in your wal­let, that means that you are ac­tu­ally car­ry­ing more than $300,000 with you.</p>
    <p>This alone should make you think twice about leav­ing your cards in your locker when you are at your gym or coun­try club next time.</p>
    <p>Ms Natalia Goh, gen­eral man­ager of credit cards and per­sonal loans at Stan­dard Char­tered Bank here, says card hold­ers should set up SMS alerts with their banks so that they can be kept in­formed of all trans­ac­tions on their cards.</p>
    <p>“They can be alerted on trans­ac­tions made on their cards, even if it is just $1. Card hold­ers should also pay close at­ten­tion to the de­tails on the alerts – mer­chant name, trans­ac­tion value, tim­ing and date of trans­ac­tion – and con­tact the bank im­me­di­ately if there are any sus­pi­cious or unau­tho­rised trans­ac­tions,” she adds.</p>
    <p>It is quite com­mon to read about hack­ers who break into com­pany data­bases to steal clients’ credit card de­tails.</p>
    <p>As you are likely to have reg­is­tered your cards on nu­mer­ous on­line plat­forms, in­clud­ing pop­u­lar ones such as Ap­ple and Ama­zon, it pays to set trans­ac­tion alerts.</p>
    <p>While banks will not hold cus­tomers li­able for se­cu­rity breaches by or­gan­ised crime syn­di­cates, you still have a duty to in­form it if you know some­one has tried to use your card il­le­gally.</p>
    <p>More im­por­tantly, if you sus­pect that your card has been com­pro­mised, ask your bank to can­cel it and is­sue a new one. This will save you the headache of deal­ing with unau­tho­rised charges later.</p>
    <p>Dis­putes can be lengthy and painful. Don’t let the con­ve­nience of on­line shop­ping lull you into let­ting your guard down. If you buy from an over­seas mer­chant, make sure it is trust­wor­thy or your shop­ping night­mare will start soon enough.</p>
    <p>Note that such credit card dis­putes can take up to 12 weeks to re­solve.</p>
    <p>Just as you have your bank on your side, a mer­chant can also make al­le­ga­tions about you with his bank and ac­cuse you of be­ing a dis­hon­est cus­tomer who is out to con him.</p>
    <p>So it de­pends on who has the stronger case. For clear-cut fraud, most banks re­quire cus­tomers to lodge po­lice re­ports as proof that their com­plaints are gen­uine.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Visa/Master­card charge back scheme, a card­holder can get a re­fund if a mer­chant has failed to de­liver the goods pur­chased by the stip­u­lated date.</p>
    <p>But things are not so clear if the dis­pute is about the qual­ity of pur­chased goods.</p>
    <p>OCBC’s Mr Tan says: “As the card is­suer, our role is to fa­cil­i­tate the pay­ment. If the buyer is not sat­is­fied with the prod­uct, his dis­pute will have to be raised with the mer­chant. The out­come and method of re­fund rests en­tirely on the mer­chant.”</p>
    <p>This means there is no au­to­matic re­fund for prod­uct qual­ity un­less the goods are found to be de­fec­tive or not as de­scribed. Even so, such dis­putes will be re­viewed on a case-by-case ba­sis.</p>
    <p>So don’t click on the pur­chase but­ton un­less you know you are buy­ing from an hon­est mer­chant. Oth­er­wise you will end up mak­ing crooks richer at your ex­pense.</p>
