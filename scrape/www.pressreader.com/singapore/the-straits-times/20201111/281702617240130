    <p>Sin­ga­pore can go ahead with phase three of its re­open­ing only if three key con­di­tions are met, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“There may be a chance we can do it be­fore the end of the year. If not, we will roll over to Jan­uary or some time early next year,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It’s more im­por­tant that we do it right than we rush into phase three and end up with bad con­se­quences down the road.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong was speak­ing at a press con­fer­ence by the multi-min­istry task force on Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have been await­ing the fur­ther eas­ing of re­stric­tions as it has been al­most five months since the coun­try moved into phase two of its pro­gres­sive re­open­ing, fol­low­ing an eight-week cir­cuit breaker pe­riod ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Also, the task force had, at an Oct 20 press con­fer­ence, raised the pos­si­bil­ity of Sin­ga­pore mov­ing into phase three be­fore the end of this year should it be able to meet var­i­ous con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>But yes­ter­day, Mr Wong, who co-chairs the task force, stressed that this would be pos­si­ble only if ev­ery­one does his part, be­cause with more events al­lowed to take place, the risk of a swell in coro­n­avirus cases is higher.</p>
    <p>“We must be pre­pared to ex­pect the num­ber of com­mu­nity cases to go up per­haps to the low teens, maybe even to the 20s or up­wards to the 30s,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We have to be men­tally pre­pared for that and be ready to en­sure that even if the lo­cal cases in the com­mu­nity were to rise, they do not form large clus­ters that are out of con­trol,” he said as he elab­o­rated on the three key con­di­tions that need to be ful­filled.</p>
    <p>First, the TraceTo­gether pro­gramme must have a par­tic­i­pa­tion rate of about 70 per cent, up from the cur­rent rate of less than 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme plays a key role in con­tact trac­ing ef­forts which, in them­selves, are im­por­tant for Sin­ga­pore to re­open safely.</p>
    <p>TraceTo­gether to­kens are be­ing dis­trib­uted is­land­wide, but there is no need to col­lect a to­ken, Mr Wong pointed out as he urged peo­ple to down­load the TraceTo­gether app on their smart­phones.</p>
    <p>“The faster you down­load the app, the faster we get to a higher par­tic­i­pa­tion rate, the bet­ter the stars can be aligned. So con­sider down­load­ing the app if you haven’t.”</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, there must be an over­all sense of com­pli­ance with safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“We do need to see Sin­ga­pore­ans tak­ing to­day’s mea­sures se­ri­ously, be­cause if peo­ple are not even re­spon­si­ble enough to up­hold (them), then go­ing for fur­ther re­lax­ation is go­ing to be very risky.”</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties will as­sess this con­di­tion through safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors, who will con­tinue to ob­serve the sit­u­a­tion on the ground at places such as restau­rants and parks, he said.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, Sin­ga­pore’s test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties must be suf­fi­cient, an as­pect in which the coun­try is “pro</p>
    <p>VI­TAL TO DO IT RIGHT</p>
    <p>It’s more im­por­tant that we do it right than we rush into phase three and end up with bad con­se­quences down the road.</p>

    <p>ceed­ing well”, he said.</p>
    <p>“We do have the test­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties in place, so we just need the con­tact trac­ing – TraceTo­gether – to be up. We need com­pli­ance with safe man­age­ment mea­sures to also be up there, and then with all three in­di­ca­tors show­ing the green light, we would be in a po­si­tion to en­ter phase three.</p>
    <p>“Ex­actly when that hap­pens, we keep an open mind, we will watch over it very care­fully,” he said.</p>
