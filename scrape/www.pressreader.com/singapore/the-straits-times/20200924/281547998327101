    <p>1 380 beached whales dead</p>
    <p>Most of a 470-strong pod of pi­lot whales found beached off Aus­tralia’s re­mote south­ern coast have died, as rescuers yes­ter­day con­tin­ued rac­ing against time to free those still alive in the coun­try’s big­gest beach­ing in its mod­ern his­tory. State marine sci­en­tists said at least 380 of them have died. WORLD</p>
    <p>WHY DO WHALES BEACH THEM­SELVES?</p>
    <p>It is the ques­tion that has puz­zled marine bi­ol­o­gists for years. Mass whale strandings have oc­curred through­out recorded mod­ern his­tory, and likely ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“Strandings around the world are com­plete mys­ter­ies,” said Syd­ney­based wildlife sci­en­tist Vanessa Pirotta.</p>
    <p>While sci­en­tists do not know the ex­act rea­son, they do know that whales – and dol­phins, which are also prone to mass beach­ing – are very so­cia­ble an­i­mals. They travel in pods, of­ten fol­low­ing a leader, and are known to gather around in­jured or dis­tressed whales.</p>
    <p>“There are many dif­fer­ent fac­tors that can cause a strand­ing,” Aus­tralian government marine sci­en­tist Kris Car­lyon said. “Of­ten it’s sim­ple mis­ad­ven­ture – one or two or a few an­i­mals get them­selves into trou­ble and the rest of the group might fol­low them in.”</p>
    <p>Many of the recorded mass strandings in­clude long-finned or short-finned pi­lot whales.</p>
    <p>Whale re­searcher Olaf Mey­necke, from Aus­tralia’s Grif­fith Univer­sity, said pi­lot whales use so­phis­ti­cated sonar to find prey and for ori­en­ta­tion, so some the­o­ries link strandings to changes in elec­tro­mag­netic fields.</p>
    <p>“These changes can be caused by so­lar storms or earthquake­s (seis­mic ac­tiv­i­ties) but there is also a strong con­nec­tion be­tween ac­tive sonar, e.g. naval sonar, and dol­phin strandings in­clud­ing pi­lot whales,” Dr Mey­necke said.</p>
    <p>HOW ARE THEY RES­CUED?</p>
    <p>Re­float­ing stranded whales from beaches and sand­banks is a labour­in­ten­sive, dif­fi­cult and of­ten dan­ger­ous task.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral peo­ple are needed per whale to try and push them back into deeper water at high tide. Har­nesses and stretch­ers are of­ten</p>
    <p>used, some­times to at­tach a whale to a boat to be dragged out to sea.</p>
    <p>Rescuers try to keep the whales up­right to avoid dis­ori­en­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s ex­tremely dis­tress­ing for the whales, a lot like try­ing to find the door in a dark room while hear­ing your rel­a­tives scream for help,” said Dr Mey­necke.</p>
    <p>The car­casses of those that do not sur­vive are dis­posed of by be­ing dragged into open sea or buried on­shore, both also ar­du­ous tasks.</p>
    <p>BEACH­ING EVENTS AROUND THE WORLD</p>
    <p>New Zealand and Aus­tralia are hot spots for mass whale strandings, thanks to large colonies of pi­lot whales liv­ing in the deep oceans sur­round­ing both is­land na­tions.</p>
    <p>“They are feed­ing on squid in the off­shore wa­ters in these ar­eas and it is where some of their main food sources oc­cur, sup­port­ing many thou­sand pi­lot whales,” Dr Mey­necke said.</p>
    <p>The largest mass strand­ing in mod­ern recorded his­tory in­volved 1,000 whales on the shores of the Chatham Is­lands, a New Zealand ter­ri­tory in the Pa­cific Ocean, in 1918.</p>
    <p>Pi­lot whales are reg­u­larly trapped in Farewell Spit, a nar­row sand bar that stretches out from the most north­ern point of New Zealand’s South Is­land into the Tas­man Sea for 26km. About 600 pi­lot whales beached there in Fe­bru­ary 2017.</p>
    <p>In Aus­tralia, the most re­cent mass strand­ing in­volved around 150 short-finned pi­lot whales off the coun­try’s west­ern coast in 2018.</p>
    <p>Cape Cod in the US state of Mas­sachusetts, a hook-shaped penin­sula ex­tend­ing into the At­lantic Ocean, is an­other global hot spot, with an av­er­age of more than 200 stranded whales or dol­phins each year.</p>
    <p>More than 300 sei whales died in re­mote wa­ters off Patag­o­nia, Chile, in 2015.</p>

        <p data-role="text">A whale be&#xAD;ing loaded onto a trailer in Mac&#xAD;quarie Har&#xAD;bour on the west coast of Tas&#xAD;ma&#xAD;nia on Tues&#xAD;day. Hun&#xAD;dreds of pi&#xAD;lot whales have died in a mass strand&#xAD;ing in south&#xAD;ern Aus&#xAD;tralia, and the out&#xAD;look for those still alive was said to be bleak.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Stranded whales on a beach in Mac&#xAD;quarie Har&#xAD;bour on the rugged west coast of Tas&#xAD;ma&#xAD;nia on Tues&#xAD;day. The whales have been found stranded up to 10km apart, and of&#xAD;fi&#xAD;cials have now ex&#xAD;panded their search area to see if more of the mam&#xAD;mals are stuck nearby.</p>
