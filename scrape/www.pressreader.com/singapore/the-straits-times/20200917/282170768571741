    <p>The Home Team has un­veiled a new un­manned drone that will al­low agen­cies to fly far­ther into ar­eas to do se­cu­rity sweeps, cov­er­ing larger ar­eas based on a pre-pro­grammed flight path.</p>
    <p>The drone, which em­barked on its maiden long-dis­tance flight yes­ter­day, can be op­er­ated be­yond the sight of the op­er­a­tor, which means it can fly sev­eral kilo­me­tres away from the per­son con­trol­ling it, in­stead of be­ing only sev­eral hun­dred me­tres away.</p>
    <p>The ma­chine, de­vel­oped by the Home Team Science and Tech­nol­ogy Agency (HTX) and ST Engi­neer­ing Aero­space, ex­e­cutes long-dis­tance Be­yond Vis­ual Line of Sight (BVLOS) flights for un­manned aerial ve­hi­cles (UAVs).</p>
    <p>This is as op­posed to Ex­tended Vis­ual Line of Sight (EVLOS) flights, which re­quire a safety pi­lot to eye­ball the drone and take over con­trol if re­quired, work­ing with a pri­mary drone op­er­a­tor sit­u­ated in a con­trol room.</p>
    <p>With this new tech­nol­ogy, Home Team agen­cies will be able to use the drone in ar­eas such as pa­trolling and mon­i­tor­ing larger perime­ters. The drone can also be used to con­duct se­cu­rity op­er­a­tions in in­ac­ces­si­ble ar­eas or in sit­u­a­tions that are too risky for man­ual op­er­a­tors to be present.</p>
    <p>The drone can pro­vide real-time sit­u­a­tional pic­tures of in­ci­dent sites and bird’s-eye views of largescale or high-se­cu­rity events with large crowds, as videos from the drone can be streamed di­rectly to the Po­lice Op­er­a­tions Com­mand Cen­tre for of­fi­cers to rapidly view and as­sess the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The drone can also play a role in de­tect­ing haz­ardous ma­te­ri­als and mon­i­tor­ing large fires from above.</p>
    <p>Its devel­op­ers are also work­ing on giv­ing it the ca­pa­bil­ity to de­liver es­sen­tial sup­plies – in­clud­ing au­to­mated ex­ter­nal de­fib­ril­la­tors (AEDs) dur­ing crit­i­cal mis­sions such as build­ing col­lapses – which can shorten re­sponse times and po­ten­tially save lives.</p>
    <p>Mr K. Shan­mugam, Min­is­ter for Home Af­fairs and Law, viewed a BVLOS UAV flight demon­stra­tion at Tuas View Fire Sta­tion yes­ter­day. He said: “This devel­op­ment is a key mile­stone in the Home Team’s use of cut­ting-edge tech­nolo­gies to trans­form the way we op­er­ate.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, if there are ob­struc­tions to nor­mal routes by which fire fight­ers can move, or if ac­cess en­try routes are blocked, drones pro­vide a much eas­ier way to iden­tify breaches, he added.</p>
    <p>“HTX and the Home Team de­part</p>
    <p>CUT­TING-EDGE TECH</p>
    <p>This devel­op­ment is a key mile­stone in the Home Team’s use of cut­ting-edge tech­nolo­gies to trans­form the way we op­er­ate.</p>
    <p>ments must con­tinue to in­no­vate and find ways to har­ness tech­nol­ogy to en­hance the Home Team’s ef­fec­tive­ness in keep­ing Sin­ga­pore safe and se­cure,” he said.</p>
    <p>Such drones also came in handy dur­ing the Covid-19 cir­cuit breaker when the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force used them along­side its area pa­trols, op­er­at­ing BVLOS flights for pa­trolling op­er­a­tions around in­dus­trial ar­eas in Tuas South. The flights helped the po­lice to cover long dis­tances and large ar­eas, with a lean team op­er­at­ing re­motely.</p>
    <p>HTX is cur­rently work­ing with var­i­ous Home Team de­part­ments to de­sign and cus­tomise the BVLOS UAVs fur­ther. Also in the works is the abil­ity to out­fit these drones with an au­to­mated pay­load swop fea­ture, which could see drones car­ry­ing cam­eras, haz­mat de­tec­tors or mech­a­nisms for the de­liv­ery of items such as AEDs.</p>
    <p>Mr Cheng Wee Kiang, di­rec­tor of</p>
    <p>HTX’s robotics, au­to­ma­tion and un­manned sys­tems cen­tre of ex­per­tise, said: “The au­to­mated pay­load swop means that the pay­loads can be adapted to dif­fer­ent mis­sions and sit­u­a­tions swiftly.”</p>
    <p>The drone op­er­ates out of a drone box that comes with a set of charged bat­ter­ies that can be rapidly changed to quickly get the drone ready for its next mis­sion.</p>
