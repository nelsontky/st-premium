    <p>In the 1980s, Sin­ga­pore’s ed­u­ca­tion sys­tem went through an up­heaval. In line with gov­ern­ment pol­icy, English would be taught as the first lan­guage.</p>
    <p>Film-maker Jack Neo, 60, was in Sec­ondary 3 when the pol­icy took ef­fect at his school, where Chi­nese was the lan­guage of in­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>The change was trau­matic, he re­calls. “Sud­denly, all our books were in English. Wah!” he tells The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Sub­jects like math­e­mat­ics be­came dif­fi­cult. “Not be­cause we didn’t know the an­swers, but be­cause we didn’t un­der­stand the ques­tions,” he says.</p>
    <p>The young Neo, along with many oth­ers, sought English-lan­guage coach­ing out­side school hours.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing last week at a press con­fer­ence for his two-part com­edy-drama, The Diam Diam Era. The first part opens in cin­e­mas to­day, while the sec­ond will be re­leased dur­ing the Chi­nese New Year pe­riod next year.</p>
    <p>It is the fol­low-up to the two-part Long Long Time Ago films, both re­leased in 2016 and which tell the story of the Lim fam­ily from 1965 to the early 1970s.</p>
    <p>The word “diam”, which i n Malay means “shut up” and is also used in Sin­ga­pore Hokkien, refers to how folks such as the Lims, who rep­re­sent the av­er­age Sin­ga­porean fam­ily of the time, were buf­feted by poli­cies but felt they could not speak out.</p>
    <p>In the first two films, the Lims are shown mov­ing out of their kam­pung home into a flat and adapt­ing to poli­cies such as na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Neo’s new film touches on so­cial is­sues aris­ing in the 1980s. It was a time that many among the Chi­nese-ed­u­cated felt their lan­guage had been de­val­ued and its speak­ers dis­crim­i­nated against.</p>
    <p>In the movie, the term “Chi­nese he­li­copter” is used to mock Chi­nese who speak English poorly or with a heavy ac­cent. It is used on the sec­ondary school stu­dent played by ac­tor Richie Koh, a younger mem­ber of the Lim fam­ily, and fol­lows him into na­tional ser­vice, where he is seen as a sol­dier of in­fe­rior qual­ity.</p>
    <p>Neo ex­plains: “Our pro­nun­ci­a­tion was dif­fer­ent, which made ‘Chi­nese-ed­u­cated’ sound like ‘Chi­nese he­li­copter’.”</p>
    <p>The merger of the Chi­nese-lan­guage Nanyang Univer­sity with the Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore in 1980 to form the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore is also ad­dressed in the film.</p>
    <p>The lan­guage poli­cies, among other is­sues, took cit­i­zens like Ah Kun, a Chi­nese-ed­u­cated taxi driver played by ac­tor-co­me­dian Mark Lee, to a cross­road.</p>
    <p>“You had to ei­ther change and learn English or you made noise like Ah Kun,” Neo says, adding that the out­come of Ah Kun’s ac­tivism will be re­vealed only in the sec­ond part of the film next year.</p>
    <p>Lee, 52, who was in Tai­wan for the Golden Horse Awards last Saturday where he was nom­i­nated for Best Lead­ing Ac­tor for the mu­si­cal com­edy Num­ber 1, tele­con­fer­enced into the press event and later replied to ques­tions from ST via e-mail.</p>
    <p>His char­ac­ter Ah Kun might be abra­sive, but he has a good heart, he says. “He cares only about the present and not the fu­ture. It is why the taxi driver tends to fight any change of pol­icy – in ed­u­ca­tion or road us­age.”</p>
    <p>Ac­tress Yap Hui Xin, 29, who plays one of the three Lim sis­ters, says the is­sues raised in the film are still raw for those who lived through them. She spoke of her par­ents who ex­pe­ri­enced the dis­rup­tion at their Chi­nese-medium school. “They are still a lit­tle up­set by it,” she says.</p>
    <p>It was the same for the par­ents of ac­tress Regina Lim, 24, who plays an­other Lim sis­ter. “It was a hard ad­just­ment for them to switch to English,” she says.</p>
    <p>In the movie, a dis­grun­tled Ah Kun forms a po­lit­i­cal party, but is dis­mayed to find that un­der the group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituency (GRC) scheme, which came into ef­fect in 1988, he has to re­cruit friends Os­man (played by co­me­dian-ac­tor Suhaimi Yu­sof) and Shamu­gen (played by Sil­vara­joo Prakasam) into his team.</p>
    <p>Suhaimi, 51, spoke of how his point of view as a Malay, and that of Sil­vara­joo as an In­dian, were in­cor­po­rated into the film on the fly, as is typ­i­cal of Neo’s method.</p>
    <p>In one scene, Ah Kun com­plains about how the GRC sys­tem is un­fair to in­de­pen­dent can­di­dates like him.</p>
    <p>In­stead of agree­ing, Os­man pushes back, telling him that not ev­ery­one thinks it is a bad idea.</p>
    <p>The in­flex­ion point in the scene could not have hap­pened with­out in­put from Suhaimi and Sil­vara­joo. It was why the scene took a whole day to shoot, Suhaimi says.</p>
    <p>“The GRC is­sue is a sen­si­tive one. We were not just shoot­ing a scene. We also ex­changed in­for­ma­tion – so many of our thoughts went into it,” he adds.</p>
    <p>• The Diam Diam Era opens in cin­e­mas to­day. See re­view be­low.</p>
