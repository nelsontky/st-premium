    <p>Malaysia has pro­posed some changes to the Kuala Lumpur-Sin­ga­pore High Speed Rail (HSR) project, and Sin­ga­pore has been dis­cussing them in good faith with Malaysia, a Min­istry of Trans­port (MOT) spokesman said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysian news web­site Free Malaysia To­day (FMT) re­ported that Malaysia is con­sid­er­ing chang­ing the project so the line ends in Jo­hor Baru rather than Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>This would mean the project, an­nounced in 2010, would re­sume with­out Sin­ga­pore’s par­tic­i­pa­tion.</p>
    <p>It has been sus­pended twice at Malaysia’s re­quest.</p>
    <p>The MOT spokesman told The Straits Times: “Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to be­lieve that the HSR project is ben­e­fi­cial for both coun­tries, and re­mains fully com­mit­ted to ful­fill­ing our obli­ga­tions un­der the HSR bi­lat­eral agree­ment. We will make our best ef­forts to con­clude dis­cus­sions with Malaysia by Dec 31, 2020.”</p>
    <p>The spokesman said that if, by Dec 31, Malaysia does not pro­ceed with the project, “un­der our agree­ments with Malaysia, Malaysia will bear the agreed costs in­curred by Sin­ga­pore in ful­fill­ing the HSR bi­lat­eral agree­ment”.</p>
    <p>The first ex­ten­sion in Septem­ber 2018 was to end in May this year, but it was ex­tended for a sec­ond and fi­nal time, till Dec 31.</p>
    <p>FMT said its two sources were crit­i­cal of the lat­est change, with one say­ing it would call into ques­tion the sus­tain­abil­ity of the project.</p>
    <p>The source said the project was touted as a game changer on one of the world’s busiest air routes. He said end­ing the line in Jo­hor Baru would cre­ate a re­dun­dancy, as there are plans to con­nect KL Sen­tral train sta­tion to JB Sen­tral sta­tion, with trains trav­el­ling up to 160kmh un­der Malaysian rail op­er­a­tor KTM’s elec­tric train ser­vice project.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s MOT spokesman re­it­er­ated that the HSR bi­lat­eral agree­ment, signed in De­cem­ber 2016, is a legally bind­ing in­ter­na­tional pact that re­mains in force to­day.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment sign­ing was wit­nessed by Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong and then Malaysian Pre­mier Na­jib Razak in Pu­tra­jaya.</p>
    <p>But af­ter a change of gov­ern­ment fol­low­ing the 2018 Malaysian gen­eral elec­tion, then Prime Min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad ini­tially wanted to scrap the HSR as part of a re­view of mega projects, in a bid to trim a RM1 tril­lion (S$325 bil­lion) na­tional debt.</p>
    <p>The Pakatan Hara­pan ad­min­is­tra­tion later clar­i­fied that it wanted to de­lay the start of con­struc­tion, as a can­cel­la­tion would have en­tailed a high amount of com­pen­sa­tion un­der the HSR agree­ment.</p>
    <p>In July, PM Lee said the ba­sic think­ing be­hind the HSR – that Sin­ga­pore and Kuala Lumpur are two ci­ties with sig­nif­i­cant links, and im­proved con­nec­tiv­ity will lead to more busi­ness and closer ties – re­mained true.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed 350km line would cut trav­el­ling time be­tween KL and Sin­ga­pore to 90 min­utes, com­pared with over four hours by car. It would also slash the cur­rent five­hour end-to-end air-travel time.</p>
