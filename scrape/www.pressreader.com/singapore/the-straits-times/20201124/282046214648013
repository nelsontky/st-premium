    <p>Chil­dren keen to play hide-and­seek can now band to­gether on­line to find a new lov­able friend called Ai.</p>
    <p>They can lo­cate hid­den clues or trea­sures and dis­cover a spe­cial out­fit for Ai – a six-year-old boy who trav­els the world and shares a strong bond with his grand­fa­ther.</p>
    <p>The Web and mo­bile game will also al­low users to nav­i­gate panoramic pho­to­graphs of mu­seum spa­ces.</p>
    <p>Called Ai Love Mu­seum: Hide-NSeek, it is one of many of­fer­ings at this year’s Chil­dren’s Sea­son, or­gan­ised by the Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB) and the Mu­seum Roundtable. This year, there are over 70 fam­ily-friendly ex­hi­bi­tions and pro­grammes on of­fer at more than 20 mu­se­ums around the island.</p>
    <p>NHB deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive Alvin Tan said at a me­dia briefing last Friday: “Our goal is to pro­vide some kind of re­lief and cheer to Sin­ga­pore­ans dur­ing this pe­riod of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Par­ent­ing dur­ing a pan­demic is only go­ing to get tougher, so the Roundtable de­cided to rally to­gether, de­velop and of­fer fam­i­lyfriendly pro­grammes so Sin­ga­pore­ans can en­joy a ‘Sin­gapol­i­day’.”</p>
    <p>Chil­dren’s Sea­son was first slated to take place be­tween May and June but ev­ery­thing ground to a halt in April when the cir­cuit breaker kicked in. Af­ter phase two started, pro­grammes were re­vised to fac­tor in safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Some mu­se­ums used the ex­tra</p>
    <p>time to col­lab­o­rate on events. For in­stance, the Malay Her­itage Cen­tre will host two work­shops fea­tur­ing gem­stones from the Gem Mu­seum’s col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>It has also linked up with the In­dian Her­itage Cen­tre and Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memo­rial Hall to call</p>
    <p>for chil­dren aged 12 and un­der to cre­ate “mini-mu­se­ums” at home.</p>
    <p>At the cen­tre of this year’s Chil­dren’s Sea­son is Ai, a mas­cot cre­ated by lo­cal artist Peter Draw, 36.</p>
    <p>Mr Draw was roped in af­ter Mr Tan caught sight of a 5m-high in­flat­able fig­ure of Ai put up for an unre</p>
    <p>lated event out­side Victoria Con­cert Hall last year. “All good things are al­ways a col­lab­o­ra­tive ef­fort,” said Mr Draw.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren’s Sea­son, which kicked off last Saturday, will run un­til Jan 3, and 54 out of its 73 events are free.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion links for all events</p>
    <p>can be found on the NHB’s web­site.</p>
    <p>Those who wish to use Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers can check if their pre­ferred mu­seum is among those ap­proved by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board.</p>
