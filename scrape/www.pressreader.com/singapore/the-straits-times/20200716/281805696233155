    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Dr An­thony Fauci, the top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert in the United States, warned that young peo­ple who go out to bars and so­cialise, think­ing that even if they got sick it would not be a se­vere case of Covid-19, are “in­ad­ver­tently prop­a­gat­ing the pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>When asked at a vir­tual event hosted by Ge­orge­town Univer­sity who peo­ple should trust on the coro­n­avirus, Dr Fauci said “re­spected med­i­cal author­i­ties”, adding that he thinks he – di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­ease – is one of them.</p>
    <p>The most im­por­tant thing is to “stick to the science and stick to the ev­i­dence”, he said, and not “get in­volved in any of the po­lit­i­cal non­sense” about masks and other is­sues that have be­come top­ics of de­bate.</p>
    <p>Many as­pects of the virus it­self, in­clud­ing who to lis­ten to, how in­di­vid­u­als should be­have and how ag­gres­sively com­mu­ni­ties should re­open, have be­come po­lit­i­cal foot­balls, with US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and mem­bers of his ad­min­is­tra­tion of­ten at odds over the dan­gers posed by Covid-19 ver­sus the risks to keep­ing the econ­omy shut­tered.</p>
    <p>Most re­cently, the is­sue of when and how to re­turn stu­dents to schools has be­come a flash­point, with Mr Trump crit­i­cis­ing the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion’s guid­ance as too dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>“As a gen­eral prin­ci­ple we should try as best as pos­si­ble to keep chil­dren in school,” Dr Fauci said, not­ing the risks from re­mote learn­ing for chil­dren’s de­vel­op­ment as well as the im­pact on their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the “safety and wel­fare of the chil­dren, and the safety and wel­fare of teach­ers” and school staff need to be taken into ac­count in as­sess­ing whether a school dis­trict can re­sume in-per­son classes.</p>
    <p>While Dr Fauci ex­pects that deaths will in­crease given the re­cent spikes in cases and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions, he said he doubts the death rate will re­turn to the lev­els seen in April, largely be­cause so many of the sick now are younger and less vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to a stu­dent’s ques­tion about the im­pact of lock­downs on peo­ple’s men­tal health, he ac­knowl­edged the stress that the pan­demic has caused.</p>
    <p>“The strain on the morale and the men­tal health of peo­ple be­ing put in a re­ally ab­nor­mal sit­u­a­tion like a lock­down is some­thing you need to con­sider and bal­ance,” he said.</p>
    <p>Still, “con­fine­ments and phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing have played an im­por­tant suc­cess­ful role in get­ting cases down”.</p>
    <p>STRAIN OF LOCK­DOWN</p>
    <p>The strain on the morale and the men­tal health of peo­ple be­ing put in a re­ally ab­nor­mal sit­u­a­tion like a lock­down is some­thing you need to con­sider and bal­ance. ’’</p>
