    <p>Fewer hy­giene in­spec­tions of food stalls and cater­ers were car­ried out last year, partly due to the dis­rup­tion caused by the two-month-long cir­cuit breaker which led to a num­ber of food es­tab­lish­ments ceas­ing op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) re­sumed its usual fre­quency of in­spec­tions af­ter June, said Min­is­ter for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment Grace Fu in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She added that the au­thor­i­ties have kept up stan­dards via other means, in­clud­ing by is­su­ing ad­vi­sories and other en­gage­ment ef­forts. These ef­forts, which con­tin­ued dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker from April to June last year, also in­cluded san­i­ta­tion and hy­giene check­lists for food es­tab­lish­ments.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu was re­spond­ing to a ques­tion by Ms Na­dia Ah­mad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio GRC) on how of­ten the au­thor­i­ties con­duct hy­giene checks on food stalls and cater­ing li­censees, whether these have been af­fected by the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, and what steps have been taken to im­prove stalls’ clean­li­ness when sus­pen­sions are is­sued.</p>
    <p>The SFA makes sure stall­hold­ers clean their stalls reg­u­larly and that work­ers who han­dle food at­tend and pass the req­ui­site food safety cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Ms Fu said that from April 2019 to March last year, be­fore the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, SFA con­ducted more than 47,000 in­spec­tions, or about two in­spec­tions per food stall or caterer. This rate of in­spec­tion later “tem­po­rar­ily de­creased”.</p>
    <p>She added: “The in­spec­tion fre­quency is guided by the risk pro­file of the food es­tab­lish­ments, which is based on the premises type, na­ture of food sold, food-han­dling process and com­pli­ance track record.</p>
    <p>“SFA also con­ducts ad hoc in­spec­tions in re­sponse to feed­back re­ceived from the pub­lic.”</p>
    <p>All food han­dlers for stalls or cater­ers whose li­cence has been sus­pended must re-at­tend and pass a ba­sic food hy­giene course be­fore they are able to re­sume work, she said.</p>
    <p>Food hy­giene of­fi­cers who over­see the sus­pended premises will also be re­quired to redo and pass a food and bev­er­age hy­giene au­dit course to con­tinue their su­per­vi­sory work.</p>
    <p>SFA will re-in­spect the premises af­ter the sus­pen­sion has been lifted to make sure the prob­lems pre­vi­ously iden­ti­fied have been fixed.</p>
