    <p>Bad al­go­rithms have been caus­ing a lot of trou­ble lately.</p>
    <p>One, de­signed to sup­plant exam scores, blew the col­lege prospects of un­told num­bers of stu­dents at­tend­ing In­ter­na­tional Bac­calau­re­ate schools around the world. Then another did the same for even more stu­dents in lieu of Bri­tain’s high-stakes “A-level” ex­ams. It prompted Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son to call it a “mu­tant” and ul­ti­mately use hu­man-as­signed grades in­stead.</p>
    <p>Ac­tu­ally, I would ar­gue that pretty much all al­go­rithms are mu­tants. Peo­ple just haven’t no­ticed yet. The foibles of al­go­rithms usu­ally go un­seen and undis­cussed, be­cause peo­ple lack the in­for­ma­tion and power they need to recog­nise and ad­dress them.</p>
    <p>When, for ex­am­ple, com­put­ers is­sue scores that de­cide how much peo­ple pay for mort­gage loans or in­sur­ance poli­cies, or who gets a job, the vic­tims of mis­takes typ­i­cally do not know what’s go­ing on. Of­ten, no­body even tells them their score, let alone how it was cal­cu­lated or how to com­pare it against a bench­mark.</p>
    <p>This makes it dif­fi­cult for them to iden­tify one another, band to­gether and com­plain – or to com­pel the au­thor­i­ties to come in and fix things.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion with the stu­dent-grad­ing al­go­rithms was an ex­cep­tion. Tens of thou­sands of stu­dents were as­sessed at the same time. They had “ground truths” with which to com­pare their scores – for ex­am­ple, how they were do­ing be­fore the as­sess­ment and what grades their teach­ers ex­pected them to re­ceive.</p>
    <p>They were well-equipped to share and in­spect their re­sults for con­sis­tency and fair­ness – and to see, for ex­am­ple, bias against kids from dis­ad­van­taged neigh­bour­hoods and schools.</p>
    <p>And they had a pow­er­ful weapon – out­raged par­ents – to push politi­cians and univer­sity ad­min­is­tra­tors to dis­card the flawed re­sults.</p>
    <p>So an un­usu­ally pub­lic scan­dal shed some light on how bad most al­go­rithms re­ally are. But it did not fix or elim­i­nate them. On the con­trary, as the coronaviru­s cri­sis and pre-ex­ist­ing trends force bud­get cuts, com­put­ers are likely to be re­plac­ing hu­man judg­ment even more, par­tic­u­larly in Amer­i­can higher ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Many ad­mis­sions and stu­dent ser­vices of­fices al­ready use al­go­rithms, typ­i­cally to sup­ple­ment hu­mans. Now that is likely to flip, with a few hu­mans over­see­ing a fleet of al­go­rithms that es­sen­tially re­place bu­reau­cracy. And there is no rea­son to ex­pect those al­go­rithms to be bet­ter than Mr John­son’s mu­tant.</p>
    <p>Worse, in­sti­tu­tions across the coun­try and around the world tend to buy their al­go­rithms from the same third-party data com­pa­nies. So those al­go­rithms’ weak­nesses and bi­ases – which tend to per­pet­u­ate and am­plify the racial and gen­der bi­ases baked into the his­tor­i­cal data – have the po­ten­tial to pro­lif­er­ate broadly through the en­tire process of ad­mit­ting stu­dents, dis­tribut­ing fi­nan­cial aid, grad­ing, rec­om­mend­ing classes or ma­jors and surveillin­g stu­dents for Covid-19 or other risks.</p>
    <p>This does not bode well for kids who hap­pen to be born in places with fail­ing schools, poor health­care, toxic en­vi­ron­ments and few suc­cess­ful col­lege grad­u­ates. The com­pa­nies and in­sti­tu­tions that de­ploy high-stakes al­go­rithms tend to rely on plau­si­ble de­ni­a­bil­ity – if they do not know what’s go­ing on in the black box, they can’t be held re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>That is not good enough.</p>
    <p>All al­go­rithms should be seen as un­trust­wor­thy un­til proven oth­er­wise. Un­til we as a so­ci­ety ac­knowl­edge this, and in­sist on the trans­parency re­quired for the pub­lic to as­sess re­li­a­bil­ity and fair­ness, we’re not ready to use them.</p>
