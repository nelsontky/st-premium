    <p>Syd­ney was iso­lated from the rest of Aus­tralia yes­ter­day af­ter all the na­tion’s states and ter­ri­to­ries im­posed travel re­stric­tions as a coro­n­avirus clus­ter in the city grew to around 70.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian Cap­i­tal Ter­ri­tory (ACT) sent a stern “do not come to us” mes­sage to the coun­try’s most pop­u­lous city of more than five mil­lion peo­ple, warn­ing its res­i­dents they would be quar­an­tined for 14 days if they ar­rived.</p>
    <p>“If you are not an ACT res­i­dent and have been in greater Syd­ney... our mes­sage is sim­ple: Do not travel to the ACT,” said the ter­ri­tory’s health depart­ment.</p>
    <p>The states of Vic­to­ria and Queens­land, as well as the North­ern Ter­ri­tory, are ban­ning peo­ple ar­riv­ing from Syd­ney from to­day.</p>
    <p>Queens­land po­lice will rein­tro­duce road check­points at the New South Wales (NSW) state bor­der to help en­force the new dec­la­ra­tion of greater Syd­ney as a Covid-19 hot spot. Syd­ney is the cap­i­tal of NSW.</p>
    <p>South Aus­tralia state im­posed 14 days of quar­an­tine for Syd­ney ar­rivals yes­ter­day and banned trav­ellers from af­fected sub­urbs.</p>
    <p>The is­land state of Tas­ma­nia took sim­i­lar steps on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>West­ern Aus­tralia state im­posed a hard bor­der clo­sure.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers from else­where in NSW will re­quire doc­u­ments show­ing they are not com­ing from the af­fected Syd­ney sub­urbs if they wish to cross state bor­ders.</p>
    <p>About a quar­ter of a mil­lion peo­ple in Syd­ney’s north­ern beach sub­urbs, where the out­break has oc­curred, have been put un­der a strict lock­down un­til Christ­mas Eve.</p>
    <p>“If we can lock down here and get rid of it, fan­tas­tic and ev­ery­one else can be free,” said Ms Rachel Bux­con, a re­tired res­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“But if it ex­tends, then we’re all in it to­gether.”</p>
    <p>NSW state Pre­mier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian yes­ter­day said pub­lic gath­er­ings across the rest of Syd­ney will be lim­ited, with house­hold gath­er­ings capped at 10 par­tic­i­pants and hos­pi­tal­ity venues at 300.</p>
    <p>“We must take this ac­tion now to en­sure we keep on top of this out­break,” she added, urg­ing peo­ple in the greater Syd­ney area to wear masks in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Un­til last week, Aus­tralia had gone more than two weeks with­out any lo­cal trans­mis­sion and lifted most rules ahead of Christ­mas. The new out­break has thrown hol­i­day travel plans into chaos.</p>
    <p>The an­nual Syd­ney-to-Ho­bart yacht race start­ing this com­ing Satur­day has been can­celled for the first time in its 76-year his­tory as crews and their fam­i­lies would have to quar­an­tine on ar­rival in Tas­ma­nia.</p>
    <p>Ho­tels and hol­i­day rentals in NSW have been swamped with mass can­cel­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“An im­por­tant re­minder as we come into the Christ­mas hol­i­day sea­son is that the virus has not gone any­where and we must re­main care­ful,” said Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son.</p>
    <p>The na­tion has avoided the worst of the pan­demic due to bor­der clo­sures, lock­downs, wide­spread test­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing. It has recorded around 28,100 in­fec­tions – with the over­whelm­ing ma­jor­ity in Vic­to­ria state – and 908 deaths.</p>
    <p>The ori­gin of the virus out­break in Syd­ney re­mains un­known, with genome test­ing sug­gest­ing a US strain.</p>
