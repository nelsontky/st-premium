    <p>Malaysian Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin has ex­pressed his hope that pro­ce­dures for al­low­ing work­ers to re­sume com­mut­ing daily be­tween Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore can be fi­nalised soon.</p>
    <p>This was among some of the is­sues dis­cussed dur­ing a cour­tesy call by Sin­ga­pore’s High Com­mis­sioner to Malaysia, Mr Vanu Gopala Menon, on Tan Sri Muhyid­din at his of­fice in Pu­tra­jaya on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“I hope Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore would quickly fi­nalise the stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures re­lat­ing to the pro­posal to al­low the daily com­mut­ing of work­ers be­tween both coun­tries, in line with ef­forts to boost the na­tional econ­omy, and help the work­ers who have been af­fected,” said Mr Muhyid­din in a Face­book post on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, more than 300,000 trav­ellers used the Cause­way con­nect­ing the two coun­tries ev­ery day. Among them were about 100,000 Malaysians who com­muted daily be­tween Jo­hor and Sin­ga­pore, mainly for work.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din said he and Mr Menon had also talked about the Re­cip­ro­cal Green Lane (RGL) and Pe­ri­odic Com­mut­ing Ar­range­ment (PCA) at the Sin­ga­pore-Malaysia bor­der, which be­gan op­er­at­ing on Aug 17.</p>
    <p>He said they both agreed that the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the two ar­range­ments has been smooth and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>“We also stated our com­mit­ment in en­sur­ing that the move­ment of peo­ple and bor­der con­trols con­tinue smoothly with­out ne­glect­ing the safety as­pect of the two coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>The RGL fa­cil­i­tates short-term travel for es­sen­tial busi­ness or of­fi­cial pur­poses be­tween both sides for up to 14 days.</p>
    <p>The PCA al­lows Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia res­i­dents who hold longterm im­mi­gra­tion passes for busi­ness and work pur­poses in the other coun­try to en­ter that coun­try for work.</p>
    <p>The ar­range­ments al­low em­ploy­ers to travel for es­sen­tial meet­ings and give work­ers op­por­tu­ni­ties to see their fam­i­lies more of­ten.</p>
    <p>“We are con­fi­dent that the mea­sures would help Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore to grad­u­ally re­store their economies and their peo­ple’s in­ter­ac­tions that have been ham­pered by the Covid-19 pan­demic,” said Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>He de­scribed bi­lat­eral ties as “grow­ing pos­i­tively” even though both coun­tries are go­ing through a chal­leng­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve that Malaysia and Sin­ga­pore have the ex­pe­ri­ence, ca­pa­bil­ity and ex­per­tise to over­come the long-term threat of the pan­demic,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that both coun­tries should co­op­er­ate in the re­search and de­vel­op­ment of a Covid-19 vac­cine, and in the fields of epi­demi­ol­ogy, an­tivi­rals and pub­lic health­care, which would ul­ti­mately ben­e­fit both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din also com­mented on the high-speed rail (HSR) project be­tween Kuala Lumpur and Sin­ga­pore, say­ing he hoped that a meet­ing at the min­is­te­rial level would be held by the two coun­tries soon to dis­cuss its direc­tion. The project has been de­ferred un­til the end of the year.</p>
    <p>For the an­nual lead­ers’ re­treat ses­sion, which is to be hosted by Sin­ga­pore this year, he said of­fi­cers of the two coun­tries would dis­cuss and pro­pose a suit­able ap­proach to hold­ing the ses­sion.</p>
