    <p>Axe Brand Uni­ver­sal Oil: Well-loved med­i­cated oil brand One of the old­est mak­ers of med­i­cated oil in Sin­ga­pore, Le­ung Kai Fook Med­i­cal Com­pany’s Axe Brand Uni­ver­sal Oil has been used by gen­er­a­tions across the globe. De­spite fac­ing ini­tial com­pe­ti­tion in the early 1930s from more es­tab­lished brands from abroad, the prod­uct soon gained an ever-in­creas­ing fan base of loyal users. To­day, the brand can be found in more than 50 coun­tries. Mr Popiah: In­no­va­tive tra­di­tional snack man­u­fac­turer Mr Popiah started as a hum­ble stall sell­ing tra­di­tional popiah at a cof­fee shop in Be­dok North in 1995. To­day, it has suc­cess­fully au­to­mated its pro­duc­tion process with ma­chines that can wrap 60 popi­ahs in one minute, in­creas­ing its pro­duc­tiv­ity sig­nif­i­cantly. It also con­tin­ues to re­search and de­velop in­no­va­tive prod­ucts, such as cooked and ready-to-eat grated turnips that re­main high in qual­ity and rich in flavour. Sold in 500g pack­ets, th­ese are sealed and pro­cessed in a unique process that de­stroys bac­te­ria while keep­ing the in­gre­di­ents fresh for up to six months at room tem­per­a­ture, with­out the use of preser va­tives. Pur­chase Mr Popiah’s Ready-To-Eat Turnip at Sheng Siong, Cold Stor­age, Gi­ant and NTUC FairPrice out­lets and en­joy a buy-one-get-one-free pro­mo­tion till the end of this month. JR Life Sci­ences/Holis­tic Way: Go-to brand for health sup­ple­ments For over a decade, lo­cal health sup­ple­ment im­porter and dis­trib­u­tor JR Life Sci­ences has been pro­vid­ing con­sumers with mul­ti­vi­ta­mins and sup­ple­ments for im­mune sup­port, bone and joint health, and more from lead­ing brands such as Holis­tic Way and name­sake JR Life Sci­ences. Avail­able at phar­ma­cies, per­sonal care stores and de­part­men­tal stores, its wide range of prod­ucts includes eye health sup­ple­ment Holis­tic Way Super Vi­sion — Eye Nu­tri­tion. It is said to en­hance vi­sion as it con­tains bil­berr y fruit, and eye­bright ex­tract that strength­ens blood ves­sels and the reti­nal cap­il­lar y bed.</p>
