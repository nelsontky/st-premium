    <p>The Premier League is not dis­cussing the pos­si­bil­ity of a “cir­cuit breaker” amid a spike in coro­n­avirus cases among topflight clubs that has forced the post­pone­ment of a third game this sea­son, ac­cord­ing to Bri­tish me­dia.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham were due to host Ful­ham yes­ter­day evening but the north Lon­don side con­firmed a few hours be­fore that the clash could not go ahead due to an outbreak at Craven Cot­tage.</p>
    <p>West Bromwich man­ager Sam Al­lardyce has called for the sea­son to be halted for two weeks in re­sponse to the Premier League an­nounc­ing on Tues­day that 18 in­di­vid­u­als – play­ers and staff – had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This is the high­est num­ber of cases recorded in 17 rounds of weekly test­ing this term and ex­cludes the clus­ter that has formed at Manch­ester City, which led to the post­pone­ment of their game at Ever­ton on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, New­cas­tle’s trip to As­ton Villa was the first fix­ture to be pushed back be­cause of an outbreak at St James’ Park and Al­lardyce is wor­ried.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one’s safety is more im­por­tant than any­thing. When I hear this (UK) vari­ant of the virus trans­mits 70 per cent quicker, we can only do the right thing,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I’m 66 and the last thing I need to do is catch Covid-19. Prob­a­bly play­ers will over­come it but it’s more dif­fi­cult for some­one like me, so I’m very con­cerned for my­self and foot­ball in gen­eral.</p>
    <p>“We had one pos­i­tive case (at the Hawthorns) this week. If a ‘cir­cuit breaker’ helps, let’s do it and let the sea­son run a lit­tle longer.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, other man­agers and pun­dits are op­posed to any form of sus­pen­sion as the cal­en­dar is al­ready so con­gested, leav­ing lit­tle room for any reschedul­ing, par­tic­u­larly as the post­poned Euro 2020 is set to start on June 11.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to Al­lardyce’s plea, Manch­ester United boss Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer said: “We as a club and group of play­ers have been re­ally good with fol­low­ing rules.</p>
    <p>“I can’t see the ben­e­fit in hav­ing a ‘cir­cuit breaker’ be­cause when will we play the games? We all know this year is so dif­fer­ent but if you just stop more games, that’s not go­ing to make a big change. When would we then fin­ish the sea­son? It may make it longer.”</p>
    <p>Pun­dit and for­mer United cap­tain Gary Neville agreed that paus­ing the English game would be “point­less”, tweet­ing: “Foot­ball has proven through the last six months it can op­er­ate safely.</p>
    <p>“It was right to be cau­tious and con­cerned through the first lockdown when the virus was new and un­known. It shouldn’t stop now in my opin­ion. This virus isn’t go­ing any­where in two-four weeks!”</p>
    <p>Sky Sports and the Guardian have since re­ported there are no plans to put the Premier League on ice as the authoritie­s be­lieve their pro­to­cols are still “ro­bust”.</p>
    <p>No club has also put forth any mo­tion to pause the sea­son, while the Bri­tish govern­ment has no talks planned for elite sport to take a break, although “all par­ties ac­cept the situation is fluid”.</p>
