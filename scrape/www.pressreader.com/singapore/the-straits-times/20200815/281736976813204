    <p>• New Zealand Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern ex­tended a l ock­down i n the coun­try’s big­gest city yes­ter­day in re­sponse to the first national coron­avirus out­break in months, stick­ing with a “go early, go hard” ap­proach she said has proven ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said ge­nomic test­ing has shown that the latest out­break is of a dif­fer­ent strain from that in New Zealand’s orig­i­nal out­break ear­lier in the year, sug­gest­ing it is new to the coun­try.</p>
    <p>She said lock­down mea­sures in Auck­land, home to about 1.7 mil­lion peo­ple, and so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures across the coun­try that were im­posed on Wed­nes­day would re­main i n place for an­other 12 days.</p>
    <p>The swift ac­tion fol­lowed the dis­cov­ery on Tues­day of the coun­try’s first l ocal Covid-19 cases in 102 days, in a fam­ily in Auck­land. Of­fi­cials have since iden­ti­fied a to­tal of 29 cases, all linked to the same clus­ter.</p>
    <p>“As we have said from the start, our over­all Covid-19 strat­egy re­mains elim­i­na­tion,” Ms Ardern said. “To­gether, we have got rid of Covid be­fore. We have kept it out for 102 days, longer than any other coun­try. We can do all of that again.”</p>
    <p>The leader is un­der pres­sure ahead of an up­com­ing gen­eral elec­tion, with the main op­po­si­tion National Party ac­cus­ing the gov­ern­ment of fail­ing to se­cure quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties and with­hold­ing in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said con­tact trac­ing and ge­nomic test­ing had found no links with the cur­rent out­break to the coun­try’s bor­der en­try points or man­aged quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>She said genome se­quenc­ing dis­proved the the­ory by some health ex­perts that the virus could have been qui­etly mov­ing through the com­mu­nity since the orig­i­nal out­break.</p>
    <p>“This sug­gests this is not a case of the virus be­ing dor­mant or of a burn­ing em­ber in our com­mu­nity,” she said. “It ap­pears to be new to New Zealand.”</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Chris Hip­kins said ear­lier that genome test­ing sug­gested the new virus out­break had orig­i­nated in Britain or Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern cau­tioned that more cases were likely to emerge in the com­ing days, but said she was con­fi­dent of­fi­cials would suc­cess­fully iden­tify the “perime­ter” of the clus­ter – if not its source – al­low­ing them to iso­late cases and re­move re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The ear­li­est case of­fi­cials have iden­ti­fied to date is a worker at an Auck­land-based cold store owned by US-based Ameri­cold Realty Trust, who be­came ill around July 31. Al­most a dozen other in­fec­tions have been di­rectly linked to the fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>Auck­land’s cur­rent level three re­stric­tions re­quir­ing peo­ple to mostly stay at home, and level two re­stric­tions for the rest of the coun­try, are not as se­vere as the five-week level four shut­down im­posed ear­lier in the year.</p>
    <p>“I would char­ac­terise our ap­proach as a ‘short but pre­cau­tion­ary hold’ in an on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion that will stamp out the virus,” Ms Ardern said of the cur­rent mea­sures, which will last a to­tal of 14 days, the known in­cu­ba­tion pe­riod for the virus.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion National Party has been pres­sur­ing Ms Ardern to de­lay the Sept 19 elec­tion, ar­gu­ing that its in­abil­ity to cam­paign due to re­stric­tions gave her gov­ern­ment an un­fair ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern said yes­ter­day that she would make a de­ci­sion in the next 48 hours.</p>
    <p>Amid con­cerns that a fresh lock­down would come with a huge eco­nomic cost, Ms Ardern also an­nounced the ex­ten­sion of a wage sub­sidy scheme and mort­gage de­fer­ral pro­gramme to sup­port busi­nesses and pro­tect jobs.</p>
    <p>“Lift­ing re­stric­tions now and see­ing a po­ten­tial ex­plo­sion in cases is the worst thing we could do for Auck­land and the New Zealand econ­omy,” she said.</p>
