    <p>As some Bri­tons were be­moan­ing and oth­ers wel­com­ing Bri­tain’s exit from the Euro­pean Union in late Jan­uary, nov­el­ist Philip Pull­man called on all lit­er­ate Bri­tons to boy­cott a 50-pence coin is­sued to com­mem­o­rate Brexit. The rea­son: the slo­gan on the coin lacked that tad­pole-like squig­gle known as the comma.</p>
    <p>In Pull­man’s view, the slo­gan, “Peace, pros­per­ity and friend­ship with all na­tions”, should have had an ad­di­tional comma af­ter the word “pros­per­ity”.</p>
    <p>Times Lit­er­ary Sup­ple­ment editor Stig Abell ex­pressed his out­rage at this omis­sion in far more dra­matic terms, claim­ing it was “killing me”.</p>
    <p>There is a colos­sal At­lantic di­vide on the use of what is known as the Ox­ford comma or se­rial comma, the comma that comes be­tween the penul­ti­mate item in a list and the con­junc­tions “and” or “or”.</p>
    <p>Although the Ox­ford comma may have orig­i­nated at Bri­tain’s Ox­ford Univer­sity Press, it is the Amer­i­cans who are its stan­dard-bear­ers to­day, us­ing it re­li­giously in al­most all in­stances. The Bri­tish have jet­ti­soned it ex­cept in cases where its ab­sence would cause am­bi­gu­ity.</p>
    <p>The apoc­ryphal “I would like to thank my par­ents, Ayn Rand and God” is the clas­sic ex­am­ple of the kind of ab­sur­dity that the in­ser­tion of an Ox­ford comma can ban­ish.</p>
    <p>So, what gave Pull­man cause for um­brage may have been his read­ing that the slo­gan, with­out an Ox­ford comma, im­plied that post-Brexit Bri­tain may be pur­su­ing pros­per­ity with other na­tions (hor­rors!) rather than go­ing it alone, a prospect that seems even more ter­ri­fy­ing now, in the time of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Three years ago, a miss­ing Ox­ford comma brought great joy to five truck driv­ers in the United States but great mis­ery to their em­ployer.</p>
    <p>A court in the state of Maine ruled that the driv­ers were en­ti­tled to over­time pay un­der the state’s laws that were ap­pli­ca­ble to all work­ers ex­cept those in­volved in “the can­ning, pro­cess­ing, pre­serv­ing, freez­ing, dry­ing, mar­ket­ing, stor­ing, pack­ing for ship­ment or dis­tri­bu­tion” of spec­i­fied per­ish­able foods.</p>
    <p>The em­ployer had claimed the driv­ers were not en­ti­tled to over­time pay as they were en­gaged in the dis­tri­bu­tion of goods.</p>
    <p>The driv­ers’ con­tention was that the law should have read “pack­ing for ship­ment, or dis­tri­bu­tion” for them to be ex­cluded from the en­ti­tle­ment; with­out an Ox­ford comma af­ter “ship­ment”, the law de­nied over­time pay only to those en­gaged in the pack­ing of goods for ship­ment or for dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>ROAD SIGNS ALONG THE HIGH­WAY</p>
    <p>Com­mas, colons, hy­phens and other punc­tu­a­tion marks sig­nal the re­la­tion­ships be­tween the string of words in a sen­tence and are crit­i­cal to en­sur­ing the log­i­cal flow of ideas.</p>
    <p>In a Time mag­a­zine ar­ti­cle writ­ten nearly two decades ago, au­thor Pico Iyer cel­e­brated the role of punc­tu­a­tion with wit and elo­quence.</p>
    <p>He wrote: “Punc­tu­a­tion marks are the road signs placed along the high­way of our com­mu­ni­ca­tion – to con­trol speeds, pro­vide di­rec­tions and pre­vent head-on col­li­sions. A pe­riod has the un­blink­ing fi­nal­ity of a red light; the comma is a flash­ing yel­low light that asks us only to slow down; and the semi­colon is a stop sign that tells us to ease grad­u­ally to a halt, be­fore grad­u­ally start­ing up again.”</p>
    <p>This “gram­mat­i­cal duty” is only one of two roles of punc­tu­a­tion marks, ac­cord­ing to Bri­tish civil ser­vant Ernest Gow­ers. The other role is the “rhetor­i­cal duty” – in­tro­duc­ing nu­ance to mean­ing.</p>
    <p>Sir Ernest, I must add, was ven­er­ated in the Sin­ga­pore civil ser­vice in the time of Messrs Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Keng Swee for his clas­sic work, The Com­plete Plain Words.</p>
    <p>TO HYPHENATE OR NOT TO HYPHENATE?</p>
    <p>Many of us of­ten face this dilemma. Not a dilemma of the ex­is­ten­tial type that Ham­let faced, but a se­ri­ous dilemma, in some cases.</p>
    <p>To bor­row an ex­am­ple from Lynne Truss’ best-sell­ing Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tol­er­ance Ap­proach To Punc­tu­a­tion, you could be writ­ing about your ex­tra-mar­i­tal sex es­capade in some sleazy part of town. Or about your ex­tra mar­i­tal sex with your spouse.</p>
    <p>Gush­ing about the abil­ity of punc­tu­a­tion to add nu­ance to mean­ing, Iyer wrote that “punc­tu­a­tion is the way one bats one’s eyes, low­ers one’s voice or blushes de­murely”.</p>
    <p>There is no deny­ing that the In­ter­net era has wrought un­told dam­age on our use of punc­tu­a­tion. (Blush, blush; I’m a slug­gard when it comes to in­sert­ing com­mas and hy­phens in text mes­sages.)</p>
    <p>But dam­age had al­ready been done through the ped­a­gog­i­cal in­no­va­tions of the 1980s and 1990s, which were based on the as­sump­tion that pupils as­sim­i­late the struc­tural ele­ments of lan­guage more ef­fec­tively through con­text than through rig­or­ous gram­mar drills, a dam­age that is only now be­ing ad­dressed.</p>
    <p>THE PAUSE-FOR-BREATH COMMA</p>
    <p>Of all the punc­tu­a­tion marks that fre­quently go miss­ing or are mis­placed in for­mal writ­ing, it is the comma that per­haps is the most abused.</p>
    <p>Many writ­ers tend to use com­mas in­dis­crim­i­nately, plac­ing one wher­ever they pause for breath. Even the cel­e­brated open­ing dec­la­ra­tion of Jane Austen’s Pride And Prej­u­dice has a pro­fu­sion of pause-for-breath com­mas: “It is a truth uni­ver­sally ac­knowl­edged, that a single man in pos­ses­sion of a good for­tune, must be in want of a wife.”</p>
    <p>Fa­mous psy­cholin­guist Steven Pinker joked in his book The Sense Of Style that Austen would have got poor grades from com­po­si­tion teach­ers be­cause her use of com­mas was guided by prosody – the pat­terns of stress and in­to­na­tion in lan­guage – rather than syn­tax.</p>
    <p>LE­GAL MINEFIELDS</p>
    <p>When com­mas in le­gal con­tracts link sep­a­rate phrases lined up one af­ter an­other, they open up a mine­field.</p>
    <p>In a fre­quently cited ex­am­ple, a comma very nearly led to Rogers Com­mu­ni­ca­tions of Canada los­ing a law­suit against an­other telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pany, which had pre­ma­turely ter­mi­nated an agree­ment be­tween them.</p>
    <p>Rogers as­sumed it had se­cured a deal that locked in Bell Aliant for the first five years. An ill-drafted clause said that their agree­ment “shall con­tinue in force for a pe­riod of five (5) years from the date it is made, and there­after for suc­ces­sive five (5) year terms, un­less and un­til ter­mi­nated by one year prior no­tice in writ­ing by ei­ther party”.</p>
    <p>But the in­dus­try reg­u­la­tors, ev­i­dently a group of gram­mar po­lice, ruled in favour of Bell Aliant.</p>
    <p>They said that “... based on the rules of punc­tu­a­tion, the comma placed be­fore the phrase ‘un­less and un­til ter­mi­nated by one year prior no­tice in writ­ing by ei­ther party’ means that that phrase</p>
    <p>qual­i­fies both the phrases ‘shall be ef­fec­tive from the date it is made and shall con­tinue in force for a pe­riod of five (5) years from the date it is made’ and the phrase ‘and there­after for suc­ces­sive five (5) year terms’”.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately for Rogers, the</p>
    <p>French ver­sion of the agree­ment was un­am­bigu­ous, and the com­pany won on ap­peal a year later.</p>
    <p>MONOGAMIST OR POLYGAMIST?</p>
    <p>One area of comma usage that trips up many writ­ers is that in­volv­ing ap­pos­i­tives or mod­i­fy­ing clauses.</p>
    <p>An ap­pos­i­tive is a word or phrase set be­side a noun or pro­noun for the pur­pose of iden­ti­fy­ing it or pro­vid­ing ad­di­tional in­for­ma­tion about it. Mod­i­fy­ing clauses per­form a sim­i­lar func­tion.</p>
    <p>There are two types of ap­pos­i­tives and mod­i­fy­ing clauses. Non-re­stric­tive ap­pos­i­tives and clauses are treated like paren­the­ses that can be safely dropped be­cause they merely pro­vide ad­di­tional, inessen­tial in­for­ma­tion. They are en­closed within com­mas.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tive ap­pos­i­tives and clauses pro­vide es­sen­tial iden­ti­fy­ing in­for­ma­tion that can­not be dropped with­out caus­ing con­fu­sion. There­fore, they are not set off by com­mas.</p>
    <p>Now, if all that sounds like the gram­mar po­lice’s mumbo jumbo, the fol­low­ing two sen­tences will throw light on what it means.</p>
    <p>John’s wife, Mary, is preg­nant. John’s wife Mary is preg­nant.</p>
    <p>In the first ex­am­ple, “Mary” is a non-re­stric­tive ap­pos­i­tive. It is non-es­sen­tial in­for­ma­tion sup­ply­ing the name of John’s wife.</p>
    <p>In the sec­ond, comma-less usage in­volv­ing a re­stric­tive ap­pos­i­tive, John is clearly a bigamist. Or even a polygamist. For it is his wife Mary, not any of his other wives, who is preg­nant.</p>
    <p>Even highly re­puted stick­lers for punc­tu­a­tion have blun­dered in this as­pect of comma usage. Louis Me­nand of The New Yorker, who glee­fully cat­a­logued nu­mer­ous punc­tu­a­tion er­rors in Truss’ Eats, Shoots & Leaves, found fault even with the line ded­i­cat­ing her book to: “The strik­ing Bol­she­vik print­ers of St Peters­burg who, in 1905, de­manded to be paid the same rate for punc­tu­a­tion marks as for let­ters.”</p>
    <p>Truss’ omis­sion of a comma af­ter “St Peters­burg”, Me­nand rightly noted, makes the mod­i­fy­ing clause fol­low­ing it a re­stric­tive one. It im­plies that she was ded­i­cat­ing her book to a se­lect few among the strik­ing print­ers when in fact the de­mand for more pay was made by all the strik­ing print­ers.</p>
    <p>DY­ING MUL­TI­PLE TIMES?</p>
    <p>They say one car­ries one’s caste mark in one’s mouth (and, I might add, in one’s scrib­bles). In his clas­sic The King’s English, H.W. Fowler wrote that “noth­ing so eas­ily ex­poses a writer to the sus­pi­cion of be­ing un­e­d­u­cated as omis­sion of com­mas against nearly univer­sal cus­tom”.</p>
    <p>But, get­ting the ba­sics right doesn’t mean rigidly ad­her­ing to some rule set out in Juras­sic times, es­pe­cially where a trans­gres­sion has no im­pact on clar­ity. Af­ter all, lan­guage is a liv­ing en­tity that evolves with the times and it should serve the needs of its users.</p>
    <p>To il­lus­trate pedantry gone</p>
    <p>over­board, Pinker drew on a sen­tence from an ar­ti­cle in The</p>
    <p>New Yorker that talked about a US Repub­li­can Party strate­gist.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore At­wa­ter died, of brain can­cer, in 1991, he ex­pressed re­gret over the ‘naked cru­elty’ he had shown to (pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Michael) Dukakis in mak­ing ‘Wil­lie Hor­ton his run­ning mate’.”</p>
    <p>The use of a pair of com­mas around “of brain can­cer” to in­di­cate that it is an in­ci­den­tal phrase is clearly re­dun­dant. It is not as if At­wa­ter died mul­ti­ple times of dif­fer­ent causes and that it was only be­fore his death from brain can­cer, not be­fore any of his other deaths, that he ex­pressed re­gret.</p>
    <p>Even Fowler, writ­ing in 1906, was sur­pris­ingly lib­eral in rail­ing against the overuse of com­mas:</p>
    <p>“Over-stop­ping is... old-fash­ioned; but it is equally com­pat­i­ble with cor­rect­ness... Any­one who finds him­self putting down sev­eral com­mas close to one an­other should re­flect that he is mak­ing him­self dis­agree­able, and ques­tion his con­science, as se­verely as we ought to do about dis­agree­able con­duct in real life, whether it is nec­es­sary... Un­gram­mat­i­cal in­ser­tion of stops is a high crime and mis­de­meanour, whereas un­gram­mat­i­cal omis­sion of them is of­ten ve­nial, and in some cases even de­sir­able. It is a sound prin­ci­ple that as few stops should be used as will do the work.”</p>
    <p>A FA­TAL COMMA</p>
    <p>Gram­mar po­lice like to joke that only a can­ni­bal­is­tic grand­child would write a comma-less “Let’s eat grandma”. Jokes aside, al­low me to point out in con­clu­sion that there is at least one prece­dent in le­gal his­tory where some­one was “hanged on a comma”.</p>
    <p>In 1916, an Ir­ish na­tion­al­ist, Roger Case­ment, was hanged in Bri­tain un­der the 1351 Trea­son Act. Case­ment had in­cited Ir­ish pris­on­ers of war in Ger­many to fight against the Bri­tish. The Trea­son Act, writ­ten in the days be­fore the comma had made its de­but, called for hang­ing any­one “ad­her­ent to the king’s en­e­mies in his realm giv­ing them aid and com­fort in the realm or else­where”.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion ar­gued that “or else­where” covered both parts of the sen­tence, mak­ing Case­ment’s ad­her­ence with en­e­mies on Ger­man soil an act of trea­son.</p>
    <p>The de­fence coun­tered that in the ab­sence of a comma be­fore the words “or else­where”, the phrase re­ferred only to the place where the king’s en­e­mies were pro­vided aid and com­fort, not to the lo­ca­tion of the king’s en­e­mies. Thus, the Act could not be ap­plied to those ad­her­ent to the king’s en­e­mies out­side his realm.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately for Case­ment, the pros­e­cu­tion promptly claimed to have found in the orig­i­nal doc­u­ment a faint vir­gule (/), the slash that meta­mor­phosed into the comma in the 16th cen­tury. De­spite coun­ter­claims that the vir­gule could have been just a blem­ish aris­ing from the stor­age process, Case­ment was hanged.</p>
    <p>So, punc­tu­a­tion isn’t just a stick­ler’s tick; at times, it can be a mat­ter of life and death.</p>
