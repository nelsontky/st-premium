    <p>From Sept 1, firms ap­ply­ing for new Em­ploy­ment Passes (EPs) for for­eign pro­fes­sion­als will need to pay them a fixed monthly salary of at least $4,500, up from $3,900 now. The bar will be set higher for those in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor – new EP hold­ers will need to be paid at least $5,000 from Dec 1, said the Min­istry of Man­power.</p>
    <p>From Sept 1, firms ap­ply­ing for new Em­ploy­ment Passes (EPs) for for­eign pro­fes­sion­als will need to pay them a fixed monthly salary of at least $4,500, up from $3,900 now.</p>
    <p>The bar will be set higher for those in the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor – from Dec 1, new EP hold­ers will need to be paid at least $5,000, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) yes­ter­day. This is the first time it has spec­i­fied a higher qual­i­fy­ing salary for a cer­tain sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Qual­i­fy­ing salaries for ex­pe­ri­enced can­di­dates in their 40s will also be raised so that they re­main around dou­ble the min­i­mum salary for the youngest ap­pli­cants.</p>
    <p>The new cri­te­ria, which mark the big­gest ad­just­ment for EPs in the last decade, will take ef­fect from May 1 next year for EP re­newals.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor was sin­gled out be­cause of the higher salary norms, as well as strong hir­ing ca­pac­ity in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Lo­cals are also in­ter­ested and avail­able to take on jobs in the sec­tor, though some may need train­ing sup­port be­fore they can be ef­fec­tive in those roles, she said, adding that the move com­ple­ments ef­forts by the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) to en­cour­age fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to strengthen their pipe­line of lo­cal tal­ent.</p>
    <p>MAS said yes­ter­day that the higher salary cri­te­ria will fur­ther sup­port hir­ing of Sin­ga­pore­ans in the sec­tor, while al­low­ing fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to con­tinue to com­ple­ment their lo­cal work­force by tapping a global tal­ent pool for deep skills and new ex­per­tise in ar­eas such as cy­ber se­cu­rity, green fi­nance and pan­demic risk in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>MOM is also mak­ing sev­eral other changes to for­eign work pass poli­cies to sup­port em­ploy­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties for lo­cals as the Covid-19 cri­sis weighs on the job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>For mid-skilled for­eign­ers on S Passes, the min­i­mum qual­i­fy­ing salary will be raised from $2,400 to $2,500 from Oct 1 for new ap­pli­cants, and May 1 next year for re­newals. The salary cri­te­ria for older and more ex­pe­ri­enced S Pass hold­ers will be raised ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>Firms will also have to ad­ver­tise</p>
    <p>BUILD UP SIN­GA­POREAN CORE</p>
    <p>If you (em­ploy­ers) are in a po­si­tion to con­sider can­di­dates from dif­fer­ent sources, then they must not favour for­eign ap­pli­cants over lo­cal ap­pli­cants that are equally qual­i­fied or equally suit­able for the job.</p>
    <p>We also want to em­pha­sise this point, once again, to busi­nesses, that they must make ef­forts to build up and re­tain their Sin­ga­porean core. This is crit­i­cal, par­tic­u­larly in a cli­mate and a time like this. jobs on the MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg por­tal for at least 28 days, up from 14 cur­rently, be­fore they can ap­ply for a new EP or S Pass, from Oct 1. The ad­ver­tis­ing rule cur­rently ap­plied only to EP-level jobs.</p>
    <p>Said Mrs Teo: “If you (em­ploy­ers) are in a po­si­tion to con­sider can­di­dates from dif­fer­ent sources, then they must not favour for­eign ap­pli­cants over lo­cal ap­pli­cants that are equally qual­i­fied or equally suit­able for the job.</p>
    <p>“We also want to em­pha­sise this point, once again, to busi­nesses, that they must make ef­forts to build up and re­tain their Sin­ga­porean core. This is crit­i­cal, par­tic­u­larly in a cli­mate and a time like this.”</p>
    <p>While high­light­ing the Gov­ern­ment’s sup­port for busi­nesses which hire more lo­cals, she stressed that Sin­ga­pore must re­main an open and con­nected hub for in­ter­na­tional busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“We do value the con­tri­bu­tions of our for­eign work­force be­cause they do com­ple­ment the lo­cal work­force in keep­ing Sin­ga­pore an at­trac­tive host to in­vestors from around the world,” she said.</p>
    <p>There were 190,000 EP hold­ers and 189,000 S Pass hold­ers here as of June, said MOM.</p>
    <p>It said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that the growth of EP and S Pass hold­ers has slowed in re­cent years, even as the econ­omy ex­panded.</p>
    <p>For EP hold­ers, growth slowed from an av­er­age of 13,000 a year in the first half of the last decade to less than 3,000 in the sec­ond half. The growth in the num­ber of S Pass hold­ers slowed from an av­er­age of 17,500 an­nu­ally in the first half of the last decade to less than 6,000 an­nu­ally in the sec­ond half.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Trades Union Congress as­sis­tant sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pa­trick Tay said yes­ter­day that the lat­est moves send a strong sig­nal to em­ploy­ers to en­sure fair con­sid­er­a­tion and treat­ment of Sin­ga­pore­ans, es­pe­cially in the cur­rent cli­mate.</p>
    <p>But he added in his Face­book post: “With higher wage floors for for­eign work­ers, we will need to pay at­ten­tion to en­sur­ing wage par­ity, in par­tic­u­lar for Sin­ga­pore­ans who are per­form­ing sim­i­lar jobs.”</p>
    <p>’’ MAN­POWER MIN­IS­TER JOSEPHINE TEO</p>
    <p>Rules re­gard­ing the hir­ing of for­eign­ers are be­ing tight­ened so that Sin­ga­pore­ans have greater ac­cess to the va­can­cies on of­fer.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) said yes­ter­day that from Oct 1, firms will have to ad­ver­tise jobs on the MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg por­tal for at least 28 days, up from 14 cur­rently, be­fore they can ap­ply for a new Em­ploy­ment Pass (EP) or S Pass for a for­eign can­di­date.</p>
    <p>Th­ese changes un­der the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work (FCF) are aimed at giv­ing lo­cal job seek­ers more time to re­spond to job open­ings and for em­ploy­ers to se­ri­ously eval­u­ate their ap­pli­ca­tions, said the min­istry in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the ad­ver­tis­ing re­quire­ment cov­ered only EP-level jobs. It ap­plies to em­ploy­ers with at least 10 em­ploy­ees, but does not in­clude jobs pay­ing a fixed monthly salary of $20,000 and above, those to be filled by in­tra-cor­po­rate trans­fer­ees or short-term va­can­cies of up to one month.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said the rule is be­ing ex­tended to S Pass jobs be­cause those are the ones Sin­ga­pore­ans work­ing in sec­tors that have been most af­fected by Covid-19, such as hos­pi­tal­ity, tend to be try­ing to re­turn to.</p>
    <p>“We think it will make a mean­ing­ful dif­fer­ence to the pro­file of dis­placed work­ers who are seek­ing to get back into work,” she said.</p>
    <p>She added that her min­istry will pay closer at­ten­tion to com­pa­nies where there is an over-con­cen­tra­tion of EP or S Pass hold­ers from a sin­gle source coun­try.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have no­ticed this hap­pen­ing in cer­tain com­pa­nies, de­part­ments and in­dus­tries, and it has be­come a source of con­cern for them, she noted.</p>
    <p>There are two main rea­sons why it should be avoided, she said.</p>
    <p>First, Covid-19 has shown that bor­ders may sud­denly close and if a firm has a very high con­cen­tra­tion of staff from par­tic­u­lar coun­tries, it could be putting it­self in a very risky po­si­tion, she said, draw­ing par­al­lels to the ra­tio­nale for di­ver­si­fy­ing sup­ply lines.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, it af­fects the fabric of so­ci­ety and the sense of com­fort peo­ple feel, whether in the work­place or in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore has al­ways been mul­tira­cial, Sin­ga­pore has al­ways been mul­ti­cul­tural, and hav­ing that rich fabric is im­por­tant. So if you have in cer­tain com­pa­nies or in­dus­tries a very high con­cen­tra­tion of one (na­tion­al­ity), this doesn’t feel the same as what we have come to be fa­mil­iar with about Sin­ga­pore,” she said.</p>
    <p>MOM will scru­ti­nise more firms, in­clud­ing those whose Sin­ga­porean core has been weak­en­ing or whose EP and S Pass work­force are overly con­cen­trated from a sin­gle source. They may be placed on the FCF watch list for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices.</p>
    <p>So far this year, 90 em­ploy­ers have had their work pass priv­i­leges sus­pended be­cause of FCF in­fringe­ments, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>When eval­u­at­ing ap­pli­ca­tions for EPs and S Passes, MOM will now also place more em­pha­sis on whether the firm has con­tin­ued to sup­port their lo­cal PMET (pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians) staff and re­sponded to gov­ern­ment ef­forts to help them re­cruit and train more Sin­ga­porean PMETs, or whether it has dis­crim­i­nated against qual­i­fied Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>This is in re­sponse to the un­cer­tain economic times, to “help sus­tain pub­lic sup­port for a busi­ness­friendly work pass pol­icy”, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>When asked whether MOM has con­sid­ered im­ple­ment­ing a quota for EPs, Mrs Teo said that the min­istry does not close off any pol­icy op­tions. But based on the de­sired em­ploy­ment out­comes, the aim is to help busi­nesses to re­cover, and not to in­tro­duce ma­jor shocks to the cur­rent sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“We shouldn’t go over­board. We should make sure they are mean­ing­ful ad­just­ments that sup­port lo­cal em­ploy­ment but not to the ex­tent where it will im­pede a com­pany’s abil­ity to re­cover and grow within Sin­ga­pore,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause we re­ally do need the com­pa­nies to ex­pand op­por­tu­ni­ties. And so they must have ac­cess to the com­ple­ment of skills and tal­ent that they can find from any­where, put them to­gether, base it out of Sin­ga­pore and make a suc­cess of it.”</p>
    <p>It is in­evitable that some peo­ple will at­tribute (the for­eign work pass pol­icy changes) to the elec­tions, some peo­ple will claim credit for hav­ing brought it about, but you can’t let that be the driv­ing force for your de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>The rea­son to move is the con­di­tions have changed a lot since the last time we ad­justed (in Budget 2020), and the con­di­tions will con­tinue to change, and there is slack in the job mar­ket al­ready. And if you choose not to move now in or­der to avoid that sus­pi­cion, and then wait six months later (till Budget 2021) to do so, have we done a bet­ter thing for Sin­ga­pore­ans?</p>
    <p>I think the an­swer is no.</p>
