    <p>DUBAI • Is­rael’s land­mark deal with the United Arab Emi­rates to nor­malise ties could see busi­nesses from the Jewish state op­er­at­ing on arch-ri­val Iran’s doorstep, but is un­likely to dis­turb Emi­rati eco­nomic ties to Iran.</p>
    <p>It could also pave the way for di­rect eco­nomic en­gage­ment be­tween Is­raeli and UAE-based Ira­nian busi­ness peo­ple that would reap ben­e­fits from pol­i­tics, ex­perts say.</p>
    <p>Dr Cinzia Bianco, a re­search fel­low at the Euro­pean Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions, said it would be a while be­fore Ira­ni­ans in the UAE come face to face with Is­raelis.</p>
    <p>“It is im­por­tant to stress here that most Ira­ni­ans with real ties in the Is­lamic repub­lic were ei­ther ex­pelled or moved away in the past years,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Those who re­mained in Dubai or the UAE in gen­eral are the ul­tra­prag­matic busi­ness peo­ple, who refuse to get en­meshed in any kind of pol­i­tics. So some of them view this deal as an op­por­tu­nity, not a chal­lenge,” she added.</p>
    <p>The oil-rich UAE is the first Gulf state to es­tab­lish ties with Is­rael, in a deal that came amid ris­ing ten­sions with Iran, ac­cused by its neigh­bours of fu­elling re­gional in­sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Abu Dhabi ac­cuses Te­heran of oc­cu­py­ing three Emi­rati is­lands since 1971, and down­graded ties with Iran in 2016 amid ri­valry be­tween UAE ally Saudi Ara­bia and the Is­lamic repub­lic, which is also tar­geted by painful US eco­nomic sanc­tions.</p>
    <p>De­spite ten­sions, the UAE and Iran, which lie 70km apart across the strate­gic Strait of Hor­muz, have main­tained diplo­matic ex­changes and cru­cially pro­tected their eco­nomic ties, gen­er­at­ing bil­lions for both sides.</p>
    <p>“Te­heran is not in a po­si­tion to forgo its eco­nomic ties with any coun­try – es­pe­cially not the UAE which is prac­ti­cally next door,” said Dr Ellen Wald, a se­nior fel­low at the At­lantic Coun­cil’s Global En­ergy Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“Iran also has close ties to coun­tries like China that work along­side Is­rael,” she told Agence FrancePres­se.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Is­rael-UAE ac­cord, which United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump helped bro­ker, Is­rael agreed to sus­pend its planned an­nex­a­tion of ar­eas in the oc­cu­pied West Bank.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo will visit Is­rael to­day and the UAE to­mor­row to dis­cuss the coun­tries’ nor­mal­i­sa­tion deal, ac­cord­ing to two sources briefed on his itinerary.</p>
    <p>Two days af­ter Mr Trump’s shock an­nounce­ment of the deal, Ira­nian Pres­i­dent Has­san Rouhani warned the UAE “against open­ing the path of Is­rael to the re­gion”.</p>
    <p>The UAE sum­moned Iran’s en­voy to protest against the “threats”, al­though it in­sisted the next day that the agree­ment “was not di­rected against Iran”.</p>
    <p>But feel­ings are still run­ning high in the Strait of Hor­muz – a vi­tal cor­ri­dor con­nect­ing the petroleum­rich states of the Mid­dle East with mar­kets in Asia, Europe, North Amer­ica and else­where.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the En­ergy In­for­ma­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion, 35 per cent of the world’s seaborne oil passes through the Strait of Hor­muz.</p>
    <p>Trade be­tween the UAE and Iran is worth bil­lions of dol­lars, with Dubai his­tor­i­cally serv­ing as a cen­tre for Ira­nian off­shore busi­ness.</p>
    <p>More than 8,000 Ira­nian com­pa­nies and 6,000 traders op­er­ate across the UAE, mak­ing it highly likely they will en­counter the ex­pected wave of Is­raeli mer­chants and in­vestors.</p>
    <p>“Ira­ni­ans in the UAE are not in a po­si­tion to com­plain about the Is­rael-UAE re­la­tion­ship, but there is lit­tle in­di­ca­tion that the typ­i­cal Ira­nian would be dis­turbed by this,” Dr Wald said.</p>
    <p>She noted that be­fore the 1979 Is­lamic revo­lu­tion that top­pled the Western-backed Shah, “Iran and Is­rael had a co­op­er­a­tive re­la­tion­ship”.</p>
    <p>The UAE is also home to a size­able Ira­nian com­mu­nity that owns hun­dreds of prop­er­ties and has in­vested heav­ily in the in­fra­struc­ture of the coun­try since its for­ma­tion in 1971.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Emi­rati me­dia, tens of thou­sands of Ira­ni­ans live in the UAE while Ira­nian of­fi­cials es­ti­mate their num­ber to be closer to half a mil­lion. Around 350,000 Ira­ni­ans visit the Emi­rates each year.</p>
    <p>Many prom­i­nent Emi­rati fam­i­lies are orig­i­nally from Iran, with some mem­bers hold­ing govern­ment jobs.</p>
    <p>Some Ira­ni­ans, like pub­lic re­la­tions ex­ec­u­tive Fariba, say they are not con­cerned by the UAE-Iran deal to nor­malise ties.</p>
    <p>“I am a di­vorced mother, and I need to work to raise my son. That’s all I care about,” said the 45-yearold, who did not give her sur­name.</p>
