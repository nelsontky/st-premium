    <p>BEI­JING • China re­ported 24 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, up from 13 cases a day ear­lier, while the au­thor­i­ties were mon­i­tor­ing pos­si­ble con­tacts in the tourism hot spot of Hainan.</p>
    <p>There were five lo­cal cases and 19 im­ported in­fec­tions on Satur­day, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment by the Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new asymp­to­matic cases, which China does not clas­sify as con­firmed cases, fell to 14 from 17 a day ear­lier.</p>
    <p>As at Satur­day, China had 86,725 con­firmed Covid-19 cases. The death toll re­mained at 4,634.</p>
    <p>Two tourists vis­it­ing Sanya in Hainan, China’s south­ern­most is­land prov­ince, were found to be in close con­tact with an asymp­to­matic case in the city of Xi’an in the north-west­ern Shaanxi prov­ince, af­ter they had lunch to­gether on Dec 9.</p>
    <p>Hainan, known as the “Hawaii of China”, has been free of coro­n­avirus for six months, draw­ing ea­ger hol­i­day­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>The two tourists and 43 other peo­ple who were in close con­tact are be­ing quar­an­tined in Sanya, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment on the city’s of­fi­cial WeChat ac­count.</p>
    <p>China’s far west­ern re­gion of Xin­jiang saw a sharp in­crease in lo­cal Covid-19 cases from mid-July to mid-Au­gust and an­other lo­cal wave from late Oc­to­ber to early last month.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the na­tional day hol­i­days in Oc­to­ber, a new wave of the pan­demic oc­curred with lo­cal cases first re­ported in Qing­dao in east­ern Shan­dong prov­ince.</p>
    <p>Last month, spo­radic cases in the dis­tricts of Shang­hai and Tian­jin and the In­ner Mon­go­lia re­gion in the north were re­ported.</p>
    <p>This month, more lo­cal cases have been re­ported in the prov­inces of Sichuan in the south-west of the coun­try and Hei­longjiang in the north-east.</p>
