    <p>Stephen Wise is 53 and has never run a sub four-hour marathon or stood on a race podium. But, if all goes well this year, the Scots­man will join a rare group of peo­ple who have com­pleted races in all seven con­ti­nents.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber, he plans to race in the 250km, seven-day Antarc­tica leg of the 4 Deserts Ul­tra­ma­rathon Se­ries, which would round up his par­tic­i­pa­tion af­ter com­plet­ing Namibia in 2017, Gobi (2018) and Ata­cama (2019).</p>
    <p>Wise, a man­age­ment con­sul­tant at IT so­lu­tions firm NTT Asia Pa­cific, has been work­ing in Sin­ga­pore for nine years.</p>
    <p>Since 2014, he has com­pleted 12 marathons, 35 ul­tra­ma­rathons and other races in Africa, Asia, Aus­tralia, Europe, North Amer­ica and South Amer­ica, with the fi­nal fron­tier – Antarc­tica – the only one miss­ing from his belt.</p>
    <p>He may reel off his races with glee but his foray into desert trail run­ning was far from joy­ful at first.</p>
    <p>Six years ago, a per­sonal life change prompted him to sign up for a 10km race. But he skipped the race to com­pete in his first half­marathon be­fore tak­ing on the North Face 100 (50km) and Ox­fam Trail­walker in Hong Kong – all within three and a half months.</p>
    <p>Wise, who had run only a 15km race be­fore that, said: “It was very tough, there was a lot of stub­born­ness and I never gave up.”</p>
    <p>The fa­ther of three signed up for the 4 Deserts race in Namibia with two friends. Par­tic­i­pants have to carry all their equip­ment, gear and food sup­plies for the seven-day race, camp­ing overnight in tents at check­points at the end of each day.</p>
    <p>The race com­prises four stages of 40km each day, fol­lowed by a long march of 80km over two days, and a fi­nal 10km stage.</p>
    <p>His first desert race al­most ended pre­ma­turely on the fifth day, as he strug­gled with stom­ach woes in the 50 deg C heat. Wise said: “I was vi­o­lently sick and vom­ited five times and it was very dif­fi­cult to get food into my stom­ach. My legs were gone.”</p>
    <p>But a Cana­dian run­ner walked the last 40km with him and they reached the check­point at 3am, be­fore the Cana­dian turned back to help another run­ner.</p>
    <p>Cross­ing the fin­ish line in tears on the fi­nal day was “one of the great­est feel­ings I’ve ever had in my life”, said Wise. “It was an in­cred­i­ble sense of achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>“This sport is dan­ger­ous and you can die out there. Peo­ple will give up their race just to help some­one. You make friends for life there.”</p>
    <p>Hooked af­ter his first taste of desert rac­ing, he went on to com­plete the Gobi March and Ata­cama and was sched­uled to take part in the Antarc­tica race last year be­fore it was axed ow­ing to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>His favourite race is the one in Ata­cama for its “stun­ning” views: “You’re in the shadow of the An­des mountain the whole time and there’s sand, salt plains that feel like you’re run­ning on co­ral. Run­ning down the sand dunes, I felt like a five-year-old child and I was scream­ing with hap­pi­ness.”</p>
    <p>Named by Time mag­a­zine as one of the world’s top 10 en­durance com­pe­ti­tions, the Last Desert race in Antarc­tica will be a very dif­fer­ent chal­lenge for Wise, who has lived in Asia for over two decades.</p>
    <p>He usu­ally runs 60-100km weekly, but sim­u­lat­ing the -20 deg C con­di­tions is im­pos­si­ble in sunny Sin­ga­pore as he jokes about train­ing in “a walk­ing fridge”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter com­plet­ing a goal that has cost him at least $30,000 and taken him many miles across seven con­ti­nents, he is mulling over a move to more se­date sports.</p>
    <p>But the desert could lure him back in the fu­ture, as he would re­turn to Ata­cama if his two adult sons de­cide to race with him.</p>
    <p>On the ap­peal of desert run­ning, he added: “I’m the slow guy, I’m 53, I don’t look like a run­ner. I’m not fast and I’m never go­ing to get a gold medal. But what’s won­der­ful about this sport is that it doesn’t mat­ter. Whether you are first or last, you get a T-shirt and a medal.”</p>
