    <p>A life-chang­ing snorkellin­g trip near Aus­tralia’s Great Bar­rier Reef last Oc­to­ber in­spired Ms Michelle Chow, 32, to start a social en­ter­prise ded­i­cated to sav­ing the earth.</p>
    <p>The founder of can­dle brand Pass It On had mar­velled at the un­touched beauty of the corals in the south­ern part of the coral cay.</p>
    <p>In her research for the trip, she learnt that the north­ern end of the Great Bar­rier Reef had be­come se­verely dam­aged from cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to take my niece here one day, but she is still so young. I thought, what if the south­ern part be­comes as dam­aged in a few years? It made me more aware of cli­mate change,” says Ms Chow.</p>
    <p>Har­bour­ing a per­sonal love for can­dles, she founded Pass It On two months later. She wanted to sell can­dles to raise money to plant trees.</p>
    <p>The can­dles them­selves are a sus­tain­able prod­uct – each is de­signed to be re­pur­posed as a planter and comes in a con­crete pot that is por­ous to al­low soil to breathe.</p>
    <p>Also in­cluded are com­pressed soil pel­lets and biodegrad­able pa­per in­fused with wild­flower seeds, to en­cour­age cus­tomers to grow the plants.</p>
    <p>The novel idea was a hit on crowd­fund­ing plat­form Kick­starter, rais­ing more than five times her tar­get of $2,990.</p>
    <p>Pro­duc­tion is out­sourced to a fac­tory in China. The soy wax used is im­ported from the United States.</p>
    <p>Avail­able in six scents ($32 each), the can­dles pay trib­ute to iconic des­ti­na­tions that are un­der threat due to cli­mate change, such as The Alps, The Ama­zon, and, of course, The Great Bar­rier Reef.</p>
    <p>Ms Chow later re­solved to turn the brand into a social en­ter­prise, to make the do­na­tions “more longterm”.</p>
    <p>Pass It On works with non-profit Eden Re­for­esta­tion Projects, which plants 10 trees in West Bali, In­done­sia, for ev­ery can­dle sold.</p>
    <p>The al­tru­is­tic en­ter­prise is a com­plete 180-de­gree change from Ms Chow’s for­mer life in the fast­paced fash­ion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>She was in fash­ion mar­ket­ing and con­sult­ing for 10 years, work­ing on projects like Sin­ga­pore Fash­ion Week, local jew­eller Carolyn Kan’s 2016 pop-up event Keep­ers, and Fash­ion Week in Shang­hai – where she lived for five years.</p>
    <p>It was a hec­tic life, one in which she had the front row seat to a lot of new tech­nol­ogy in China, re­calls Ms Chow.</p>
    <p>But af­ter a fash­ion tech start-up she co-founded went south in the mid­dle of last year, she took a twom­onth break to travel.</p>
    <p>It led her to the Great Bar­rier Reef – and research about the fash­ion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter that trip, I just felt like my in­dus­try was so detri­men­tal and evil,” she says. “Fash­ion is the sec­ond most pol­lut­ing in­dus­try in the world, af­ter oil.”</p>
    <p>She re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in Septem­ber to be closer to fam­ily and fo­cus on her can­dle busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Now that she is back, she plans to ex­pand her brand pres­ence here, as well as in the United States. Pass It On is stocked at small bou­tiques like Nana & Bird and Week­end Sun­dries, and will stock with fash­ion re­tailer The Ed­i­tor’s Mar­ket next month.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness has been en­cour­ag­ing, grow­ing steadily by 30 per cent monthly on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>During the cir­cuit breaker, Ms Chow also no­ticed “a wave” of peo­ple buy­ing and gifting can­dles to friends and fam­ily and in­clud­ing mes­sages of en­cour­age­ment to one an­other.</p>
    <p>“Can­dles are a very sub­con­scious re­ju­ve­na­tion,” she says, adding that cus­tomers have told her that the scents re­mind them of the places they are named af­ter.</p>
    <p>“I hope we can in­spire peo­ple to take a stand on cli­mate change and re­alise how frag­ile our en­vi­ron­ment is; how im­por­tant it is to con­serve, pro­tect and pass it on to our fu­ture gen­er­a­tions – hence the name ‘Pass It On’.”</p>
