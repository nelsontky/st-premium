    <p>Jakarta’s iconic Tugu Se­la­mat Datang, or wel­come mon­u­ment, fea­tur­ing bronze stat­ues of a man and a woman wav­ing warmly was the scene of vi­o­lent protests last week over a new sweep­ing “om­nibus law” to re­form tax and labour.</p>
    <p>Plumes of black smoke leapt into the sky af­ter a bus stop near the city’s land­mark round­about, known as Bun­daran HI, was set ablaze last Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Riot po­lice fired tear gas and wa­ter can­non to dis­perse the mobs, who also clashed near the Na­tional Mon­u­ment, the Min­istry of En­ergy and Min­eral Re­sources and the pres­i­den­tial palace.</p>
    <p>Over three days, sim­i­lar scenes were re­peated in at least a dozen cities across the vast ar­chi­pel­ago – from Medan on Su­ma­tra is­land in the west to Makas­sar on Su­lawesi is­land in the east.</p>
    <p>Tens of thou­sands of work­ers from the tex­tile, en­ergy and au­to­mo­tive in­dus­tries, among oth­ers, had poured onto the streets in col­lec­tive anger, to de­mand the re­peal of the job cre­ation law passed in Par­lia­ment last Mon­day, three days ear­lier than sched­uled.</p>
    <p>While the govern­ment said the law would boost for­eign in­vest­ment and re­vive an econ­omy bat­tered by the coro­n­avirus, pro­test­ers slammed it as an at­tack on work­ers’ wel­fare and the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>In Makas­sar, more than a thou­sand work­ers blocked roads and tried to force their way into the pro­vin­cial Par­lia­ment build­ing.</p>
    <p>Among them was 29-year-old Fran­cain Edy, who had ral­lied for three days. Mr Fran­cain, who works for a com­pany dis­tribut­ing gas and wa­ter pipes, said he draws less than the monthly min­i­mum wage of about $300 set for the city, and had to suf­fer more pay cuts dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Our wel­fare is only go­ing to worsen,” he told The Sun­day Times, adding that he is wor­ried about the law’s im­pact on sev­er­ance pay, rest days and re­tire­ment ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Most pro­test­ers had sketchy de­tails of the law.</p>
    <p>Ms Entin, 51, who works in a bis­cuit fac­tory in Ban­dung, West Java, said she had heard the news from her friends. The mother of six said she needed to sup­port her chil­dren, who were ei­ther in school or had low wages.</p>
    <p>“I’m anx­ious. I’m only get­ting older ev­ery day, and less pro­duc­tive,” she said.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ready tough get­ting a job, why does the govern­ment have to bother labour­ers like us?”</p>
    <p>The job cre­ation law comes in at more than 900 pages long and amends more than 70 ex­ist­ing laws and 1,200 clauses, mainly to cut red tape and trim over­lap­ping reg­u­la­tions, par­tic­u­larly in busi­ness li­cens­ing and tax­a­tion mat­ters.</p>
    <p>Seven out of the nine po­lit­i­cal par­ties in Par­lia­ment had backed the pro-busi­ness re­forms, which are ex­pected to cre­ate jobs for the 2.9 mil­lion young peo­ple en­ter­ing the labour market each year, and the 6.9 mil­lion peo­ple left un­em­ployed by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Labour unions, how­ever, are an­gered that sev­er­ance pay would be slashed and min­i­mum wages af­fected, as well as by the changes making it pos­si­ble for peo­ple to be em­ployed on a con­tract ba­sis in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>Environmen­talists also saw red over how prov­inces would no longer need to main­tain a min­i­mum for­est cover of 30 per cent of pro­vin­cial land, as well as the scrap­ping of a strict li­a­bil­ity clause that pro­vides a le­gal ba­sis to sue cor­po­ra­tions for caus­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal dam­age such as for­est fires.</p>
    <p>Nahd­latul Ulama, the coun­try’s big­gest Mus­lim or­gan­i­sa­tion, also crit­i­cised the law as ben­e­fit­ing only cap­i­tal­ists and tram­pling on com­mon folk. Its chair­man Said Aqil Si­radj said: “The rich get richer, the poor get poorer.”</p>
    <p>UN­LIKELY RE­PEAL</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo had de­fended the law on Fri­day, af­ter his work­ing visit to Cen­tral Kal­i­man­tan trig­gered a trend­ing Twit­ter topic with the hash­tag #Jokow­iKabur (Jokowi Runs Away).</p>
    <p>He said the protests are driven by dis­in­for­ma­tion and hoax news on so­cial me­dia, and promised to roll out within three months govern­ment reg­u­la­tions and pres­i­den­tial reg­u­la­tions that will pro­vide guide­lines on how the prin­ci­ples of the law should be im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>Mr Joko, or Jokowi, as he is bet­ter known, also in­vited sug­ges­tions from the pub­lic as calm re­turned on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>But chal­lengers of the law are now pre­par­ing to seek a ju­di­cial re­view at the Con­sti­tu­tional Court.</p>
    <p>Ru­mours have also swirled about in­flu­en­tial fig­ures bankrollin­g the protests.</p>
    <p>Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Af­fairs Air­langga Har­tarto was quoted by CNBC In­done­sia last Thurs­day as say­ing: “The govern­ment knows who is be­hind the demon­stra­tion. We know who is mov­ing it. We know who the spon­sor is, we know who had fi­nanced it.”</p>
    <p>COVID-19 AND IN­STA­BIL­ITY FEARS</p>
    <p>With the pan­demic rag­ing in In­done­sia, a more im­me­di­ate con­cern is whether the ral­lies would lead to fur­ther spikes in cases. As of yes­ter­day, pos­i­tive cases stood at 328,952 and deaths at 11,765, the high­est in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, 3,800 pro­test­ers, some al­legedly armed with sharp weapons and Molo­tov cock­tails, were rounded up na­tion­wide. In Jakarta, 34 peo­ple of those rounded up were found to be pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in an­ti­body tests.</p>
    <p>For some, the protests sparked mem­o­ries of the bloody May 1998 ri­ots and civil un­rest that had been trig­gered by eco­nomic prob­lems, in­clud­ing food short­ages and mass unem­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Dr Mo­ham­mad Faisal, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Cen­tre of Re­form on Eco­nomics In­done­sia, how­ever, did not think such events would hap­pen now, as the econ­omy is in a bet­ter shape thanks to low in­fla­tion and a sta­ble ru­piah. But he cau­tioned against fur­ther in­sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>He told The Sun­day Times: “In 1998, our econ­omy was un­der pres­sure and it was wors­ened by po­lit­i­cal in­sta­bil­ity. We don’t want that to hap­pen again.”</p>

Tens of thou&#xAD;sands of work&#xAD;ers from var&#xAD;i&#xAD;ous in&#xAD;dus&#xAD;tries poured onto the streets to de&#xAD;mand the re&#xAD;peal of the job cre&#xAD;ation law passed in Par&#xAD;lia&#xAD;ment on Oct 5.
