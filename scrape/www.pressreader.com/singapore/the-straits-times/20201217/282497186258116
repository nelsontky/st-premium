    <p>Conor McGre­gor is in­fa­mous for his trash talk but in 2015, right af­ter the Ir­ish su­per­star won the Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship (UFC) feath­er­weight world ti­tle, he showed a rare con­tem­pla­tive side.</p>
    <p>“There’s no tal­ent here, this is hard work,” said McGre­gor in the Power Of Sports doc­u­men­tary. “This is an ob­ses­sion. Tal­ent doesn’t ex­ist, we all are equals as hu­man be­ings.</p>
    <p>“You could be any­one if you put in the time. You will reach the top, and that’s that. I’m not tal­ented, I am ob­sessed.”</p>
    <p>This sin­gle-minded men­tal­ity, those in the Sin­ga­pore mixed mar­tial arts (MMA) com­mu­nity told The Straits Times, is the big­gest fac­tor a lo­cal fighter needs to rise to the top.</p>
    <p>The sport has en­joyed a surge in pop­u­lar­ity and par­tic­i­pa­tion here over the last five years, thanks in part to the emer­gence of Sin­ga­pore-based MMA or­gan­i­sa­tion One Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>One has staged shows around Asia since 2011 and in the last decade, it has had 31 fight­ers from 15 na­tions cap­ture its MMA world ti­tles across the var­i­ous weight di­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>They in­clude the Lee sib­lings, Angela and Chris­tian, who fight un­der the Sin­ga­pore flag in One.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they were born i n Canada to a Sin­ga­porean fa­ther and South Korean mother, and honed their abil­i­ties in Hawaii, where their fam­ily op­er­ates gyms.</p>
    <p>The Repub­lic have had con­tenders – Amir Khan lost to Filipino Ed­uard Fo­layang for the light­weight crown i n 2018 while Tif­fany Teo came up short twice in women’s strawweigh­t ti­tle fights against China’s Xiong Jing­nan in 2017 and Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>One’s group pres­i­dent Teh Hua Fung said: “MMA is still at a con­sid­er­ably ear­lier stage of devel­op­ment in Sin­ga­pore com­pared to other coun­tries in Asia, and even more so in the western hemi­sphere.</p>
    <p>“That be­ing said, to have Sin­ga­pore­ans Amir and Tif­fany com­pete against such high-level op­po­nents and world cham­pi­ons on the largest in­ter­na­tional stage shows that Sin­ga­pore has come a long way in the sport in just a few short years.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve given a lit­tle bit more time to de­velop, Sin­ga­pore MMA ath­letes can as­cend to the next level and the coun­try could very well pro­duce its first world cham­pion in the near fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines, with its tra­di­tion in boxing, has six MMA cham­pi­ons in One. Ja­pan and Brazil, also with rich com­bat sport his­tory, are next with five each.</p>
    <p>Arvind Lal­wani, who runs the Juggernaut Fight Club, said: “Com­pared to the Philip­pines, or even Thai­land, who have muay thai, and Myan­mar, who have leth­wei, we are still very early in our fight his­tory.</p>
    <p>“Mar­tial arts in gen­eral are very big in these coun­tries, while Sin­ga­pore only be­came a part of the MMA bub­ble about three to five years ago.”</p>
    <p>He added the lo­cal MMA scene needs more sup­port, par­tic­u­larly at grass­roots level. From 2014 to last year, he ran eight multi-com­bat sport events called Sin­ga­pore Fight­ing Cham­pi­onships where as­pir­ing lo­cal ex­po­nents in boxing, kick-boxing, muay thai and MMA</p>
    <p>could cut their teeth against re­gional op­po­nents.</p>
    <p>But or­gan­is­ing these events – Lal­wani es­ti­mates he loses about $5,000 on av­er­age per show – is tough to sus­tain in the long run if spon­sors are not forth­com­ing.</p>
    <p>He said: “If there are no events, how will our ath­letes com­pete? In terms of com­pe­ti­tion op­por­tu­ni­ties, there’s only One Cham­pi­onship. But they are at a very high level. Our guys need help get­ting there.”</p>
    <p>De­spite Sin­ga­pore’s rel­a­tively small pop­u­la­tion of about 3.5 mil­lion ci­ti­zens, Si­yar Ba­hadurzada, a for­mer UFC fighter who is the head trainer at Sin­ga­pore’s top MMA gym Evolve, said there is enough tal­ent here.</p>
    <p>“In the Philip­pines, peo­ple see fight­ing as a way to get out of poverty,” said the Afghan-born Dutch­man.</p>
    <p>“We don’t have this (sit­u­a­tion) in Sin­ga­pore. Here, we need a dif­fer­ent (mo­ti­va­tion).</p>
    <p>“But it’s go­ing to take time. I think Evolve, for one, is do­ing the right thing.</p>
    <p>“And in the fu­ture, when you see Amir or Tif­fany be­come cham­pion, a lot will fol­low in their foot­steps. That will spark the younger gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>His pro­tege, Amir, ad­mit­ted there was an in­fe­ri­or­ity com­plex.</p>
    <p>“I think there’s also the per­cep­tion Sin­ga­pore­ans are very soft,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I my­self grew up soft and it took me awhile to go through (tough) ex­pe­ri­ences and fail­ures.</p>
    <p>“So for me now, I feel one of my du­ties when I go up against the best in the world is to show that I am Sin­ga­pore born and bred and I’m as strong as them. Then maybe there will be a dif­fer­ent be­lief about our abil­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Lal­wani, who trains One fighter Rahul Raju and pre­vi­ously worked with Teo, said fight­ers have to also un­der­stand it is a slow process to the sum­mit.</p>
    <p>“Look at Fo­layang. How long had he been in mar­tial arts be­fore he won the ti­tle? About 10 years,” said the for­mer na­tional am­a­teur boxer.</p>
    <p>“It’s the same with Aung La Nsang (One light heavy­weight cham­pion from Myan­mar). He moved to the US to study (at 19) and has been based there since but still took over 10 years to get to that level.</p>
    <p>“Through­out those years, it’s not lu­cra­tive... It’s not easy to find some­one who has the tal­ent or po­ten­tial, to coax them to work hard enough for very lit­tle for that long.”</p>
    <p>Fo­layang, who started train­ing in wushu at 16 and won One’s light­weight ti­tle in 2016, al­most 10 years af­ter his first MMA fight, told ST: “Be­com­ing a cham­pion re­ally re­quires a lot of sac­ri­fice.</p>
    <p>“Of course, you need to be phys­i­cally com­pet­i­tive. But the men­tal as­pect is harder – you have to bat­tle and con­quer your own self.”</p>
