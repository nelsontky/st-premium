    <p>AM­S­TER­DAM/BRUSSELS • Euro­pean coun­tries are fac­ing short­ages of a Covid-19 drug, remde­sivir, be­cause lim­ited sup­plies are run­ning out, of­fi­cials said, with cases surg­ing and the United States hav­ing bought up most of drug­maker Gilead’s out­put.</p>
    <p>Gilead chief com­mer­cial of­fi­cer Jo­hanna Mercier has said it ex­pects by next week to be able to ful­fil or­ders com­ing through Europe and meet real-time global de­mand for remde­sivir by the end of the month.</p>
    <p>She said the com­pany is work­ing with Euro­pean Union reg­u­la­tors so that remde­sivir can be dis­trib­uted more widely, but with­out hav­ing to go through the coun­tryby-coun­try eco­nomic re­view process typ­i­cally re­quired be­fore a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal prod­uct can be sold in Europe.</p>
    <p>In July, the 27 EU coun­tries and Bri­tain, with a com­bined pop­u­la­tion of 500 mil­lion, se­cured doses to treat about 30,000 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>The US has signed a deal for more than 500,000 cour­ses of treat­ment, ac­count­ing for most of Gilead’s out­put through Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>“Remde­sivir has run out,” said Dutch Health Min­istry spokesman Mar­tijn Janssen, adding, how­ever, that new de­liv­er­ies are ex­pected shortly.</p>
    <p>Gilead’s Ms Mercier said: “We want to make sure that there is not only enough sup­ply to go around, but more im­por­tantly, that ev­ery­body has ac­cess to it across Europe.”</p>
    <p>The an­tivi­ral drug has been shown to shorten hos­pi­tal re­cov­ery time i n se­vere cases of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Remde­sivir and the steroid dex­am­etha­sone are the only drugs au­tho­rised in Europe to treat Covid-19. Both have been given to US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, who is also re­ceiv­ing an ex­per­i­men­tal an­ti­body cock­tail.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions across Europe have been rapidly in­creas­ing, al­though in most coun­tries still far be­low lev­els of the spring.</p>
    <p>“Due to the in­creased hos­pi­tal ad­mis­sions, the de­mand for remde­sivir is in­creas­ing rapidly,” said the Dutch Health Min­istry spokesman.</p>
    <p>Poland’s Health Min­is­ter Adam Niedziel­ski on Tues­day said the drug was in short sup­ply in some of the coun­try’s hos­pi­tals. Its lat­est ship­ment from the EU or­der ar­rived just last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Spain, which has Europe’s high­est in­fec­tion rate, ex­pe­ri­enced short­ages in late Au­gust, said its medicine agency. It has now enough doses to meet needs for the com­ing weeks, the health min­istry said on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain, which has joined the EU pro­cure­ment for remde­sivir, has ra­tioned its sup­ply, pri­ori­tis­ing Covid-19 pa­tients who need it most, the health min­istry said.</p>
    <p>Short­ages are likely to stir de­bate about the avail­abil­ity and pric­ing of Covid-19 drugs. While dex­am­etha­sone, a generic medicine, is widely avail­able and cheap, remde­sivir is pro­tected by Gilead’s patent.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has set a price of US$2,340 (S$3,200) per pa­tient for wealth­ier na­tions. It says it has also do­nated treat­ments for re­search and to treat hun­dreds of thou­sands of pa­tients around the world.</p>
    <p>NEW SUP­PLIES</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, which ne­go­ti­ates med­i­cal sup­ply deals on be­half of EU states dur­ing the pan­demic, was not im­me­di­ately avail­able for a com­ment about short­ages.</p>
    <p>The EU ex­ec­u­tive is dis­cussing with Gilead a new sup­ply deal that was meant to be sealed by late Septem­ber or this month “to pre­vent a de­liv­ery gap”, a com­mis­sion of­fi­cial told health ex­perts from EU gov­ern­ments at a meet­ing in mid-Septem­ber, minutes show.</p>
    <p>The sup­plies se­cured so far by the EU were sup­posed to cover needs un­til the end of Septem­ber. Sev­eral of­fi­cials said new de­liv­er­ies are ex­pected shortly.</p>
    <p>Gilead has ex­panded its pro­duc­tion ca­pac­ity. Last week, it said it was meet­ing US de­mand and ex­pected to cover global needs this month, even in the event that Covid-19 cases surge again.</p>
    <p>Avail­able doses in the EU have so far been di­vided ac­cord­ing to the num­ber of cases and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion rates.</p>
    <p>But not all EU states face short­ages. Ger­many’s health min­istry said its remde­sivir stocks were suf­fi­cient for the com­ing months.</p>
