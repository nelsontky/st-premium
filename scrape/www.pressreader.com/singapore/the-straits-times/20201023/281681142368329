    <p>A one-year-old baby girl was among the eight new coro­n­avirus cases an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,941.</p>
    <p>The girl is a short-term visit pass holder who re­turned from In­dia, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>She was asymp­to­matic and con­firmed pos­i­tive on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>She is also a con­tact of a 41-yearold per­ma­nent res­i­dent who was among the Covid-19 cases an­nounced on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>An­other im­ported case yes­ter­day was a 70-year-old In­done­sian man.</p>
    <p>The short-term visit pass holder re­turned from In­done­sia and was con­firmed pos­i­tive on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing five new im­ported cases in­cluded a Sin­ga­porean, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent, a work pass holder, a work per­mit holder and a short-term visit pass holder.</p>
    <p>All the im­ported cases had been placed on stay-home no­tices when they ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>There were no new Covid-19 pa­tients in the com­mu­nity yes­ter­day but there was one lo­cal case from a</p>
    <p>work­ers’ dor­mi­tory, who was de­tected through MOH’s ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries ev­ery fort­night.</p>
    <p>No new lo­ca­tions vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients were an­nounced yes­ter­day. There were no new clus­ters as well.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has de­creased from four pa­tients two weeks ago to two in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has in­creased from none to two in the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With eight cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,814 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 45 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal while 39 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 28 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
