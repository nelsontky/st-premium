    <p>The tech­nol­ogy to al­low a driver­less ve­hi­cle to move fully au­tonomously is not ready yet, ac­cord­ing to a lead­ing au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cle com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mr Karl Iag­nemma, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Mo­tional – a newly re­branded joint ven­ture be­tween Hyundai Mo­tor and Ap­tiv (pre­vi­ously known as Nu­ton­omy) – said in a we­bi­nar on Wed­nes­day that his com­pany will fo­cus on Level 4 au­ton­o­mous driv­ing, which is a notch be­low the fully au­ton­o­mous Level 5.</p>
    <p>“Level 5 tech­nol­ogy refers to a ve­hi­cle that can per­form all the driv­ing tasks un­der any cir­cum­stances, which you might call any­time, any­where,” Mr Iag­nemma said in re­sponse to a ques­tion from The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“I would ar­gue that hu­man driv­ers are to­day not Level 5 driv­ers. We tend to pull over if the con­di­tions get too haz­ardous, if the rain is too in­tense, if the snow is too heavy, for ex­am­ple.”</p>
    <p>He said Mo­tional is fo­cused on de­vel­op­ing Level 4 au­ton­o­mous driv­ing, which is driver­less move­ment within cer­tain ge­ofenced or well- de­fined en­vi­ron­ments.</p>
    <p>“To­day, it’s be­yond the state-ofthe-art and driver­less tech­nol­ogy to de­velop Level 5,” he added. “This is not to say it will never hap­pen. But to­day, a more re­al­is­tic goal is to fo­cus on Level 4.”</p>
    <p>Level 4 au­ton­o­mous driv­ing typ­i­cally re­quires a set of con­di­tions, in­clud­ing well-marked road lanes, rel­a­tively fair weather and, of­ten, the in­stal­la­tion of spe­cial road­side sys­tems such as sen­sors.</p>
    <p>In Las Ve­gas, for in­stance, where Mo­tional had un­der­taken 100,000 rides with its “rob­o­taxis”, sen­sors help its cars nav­i­gate sig­nalised junc­tions.</p>
    <p>Mo­tional was un­able to say how much such in­fras­truc­tural sys­tems would cost to im­ple­ment, but Mr Iag­nemma em­pha­sised that “our phi­los­o­phy is that we should adapt our tech­nol­ogy to the ex­ist­ing in­fra­struc­ture, rather than re­quire the in­fra­struc­ture to be adapted to our ve­hi­cles”.</p>
    <p>“I know that if we have to rely on a third party to ac­com­plish a dif­fi­cult, ex­pen­sive and time-con­sum­ing task, it makes our path to mar­ket in­creas­ingly risky.</p>
    <p>“With that said, I would make one distinc­tion: If there is the abil­ity to in­stru­ment the en­vi­ron­ment with sim­ple sen­sors that will help our ve­hi­cles, we’ll take ad­van­tage of it.”</p>
    <p>But he added that Mo­tional’s sys­tems can “op­er­ate ef­fec­tively with­out any cus­tomised in­fra­struc­ture”.</p>
    <p>Mo­tional did not say when it will roll out “rob­o­taxis” in Sin­ga­pore, but the com­pany had pre­vi­ously said its “rob­o­taxi” tech­nol­ogy will be ready by 2022.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the com­pany has hired “more than 25 full-time em­ploy­ees” from the time the joint ven­ture with Hyundai was formed in March, and Mr Iag­nemma ex­pects to add “more than 30 jobs” be­fore year-end.</p>
    <p>The staff strength in Sin­ga­pore now is about 200.</p>
    <p>The com­pany in its pre­vi­ous form con­ducted self-driv­ing tri­als in Sin­ga­pore from early 2016.</p>
    <p>On Oct 18 that year, one of Nu­ton­omy’s cars, which had two safety en­gi­neers on board, col­lided with a lorry in Biopo­lis Drive in what is be­lieved to be the first ac­ci­dent in Sin­ga­pore in­volv­ing an au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>The com­pany said soft­ware glitches were re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had sev­eral au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cle tri­als since 2014, but mostly in low-traf­fic en­vi­ron­ments such as univer­sity cam­puses and parks.</p>
    <p>Last year, the Gov­ern­ment said such tri­als will take place on pub­lic roads in the western part of the is­land soon.</p>
    <p>In this year’s Bud­get, it said some $6 mil­lion has been set aside for the test-bed­ding of au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles.</p>
