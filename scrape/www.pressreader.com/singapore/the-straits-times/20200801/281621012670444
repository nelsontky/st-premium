    <p>While many in the con­struc­tion sec­tor are ea­ger to re­sume busi­ness, they say man­power is­sues re­main one of the big­gest road­blocks – with firms re­port­ing that it is dif­fi­cult meet­ing the strin­gent re­quire­ments needed to get work­ers cleared to re­turn to work.</p>
    <p>With some 300,000 work­ers in the sec­tor, the task of get­ting them back to work, keep­ing them and the com­mu­nity at large safe, and keep­ing out­breaks at bay is a mam­moth one.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Con­trac­tors As­so­ci­a­tion Lim­ited (Scal) told The Straits Times: “The prob­lems arise with the clear­ance sys­tem and pro­cesses, while many (work­ers) are still stuck in dor­mi­to­ries for var­i­ous other rea­sons.”</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties told ST yes­ter­day that they are work­ing with the sec­tor to en­sure work re­sumes smoothly and safely, and will re­view some rules where nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>GET­TING BACK TO WORK</p>
    <p>Al­though Sin­ga­pore is on tar­get to clear all dorms ex­cept for some blocks re­served as quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties by next Fri­day, this does not mean all work­ers in these dorms can re­sume work.</p>
    <p>A Min­istry of Man­power spokesman said yes­ter­day that agen­cies such as the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity (BCA), the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore are fol­low­ing up with com­pa­nies, es­pe­cially con­trac­tors, on how they can do so.</p>
    <p>Many of the re­quired mea­sures needed to curb the spread of the virus have led to de­lays, sev­eral firms of var­i­ous sizes told ST.</p>
    <p>Mr Kenneth Loo, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Straits Con­struc­tion, said only 5 per cent to 10 per cent of his work­ers have been cleared at some sites, de­spite all ef­forts to put in place safe dis­tanc­ing and other pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Hooi Yu Koh, chair­man and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Kori Hold­ings, a spe­cial­ist in steel­work, pointed out that some work­ers were home­sick and wanted to re­turn home, but travel re­stric­tions ruled out get­ting new work­ers into the coun­try, adding to the man­power crunch.</p>
    <p>About a quar­ter of his 200 work­ers have been cleared.</p>
    <p>MOM stressed that mea­sures were in place to help to en­sure a safe and con­trolled restart of work. “As em­ploy­ers and work­ers pre­pare to re­sume work safely, it is im­por­tant that we re­main vig­i­lant and aware of the global Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion,” it said.</p>
    <p>SEGREGATIN­G WORK­ERS</p>
    <p>Scal said con­struc­tion firms are re­quired to make ar­range­ments to re­duce the risk of virus trans­mis­sion be­tween work­ers at dif­fer­ent sites. Work­ers must there­fore be housed sep­a­rately ac­cord­ing to their con­struc­tion site, to re­duce mix­ing, and jobs must be sched­uled to keep groups seg­re­gated.</p>
    <p>“How­ever smaller con­trac­tors may not have enough work­ers to have the flex­i­bil­ity for such ar­range­ments,” said the Scal spokesman.</p>
    <p>Mr Roger Heng’s firm, LSK Engi­neer­ing, is an elec­tri­cal engi­neer­ing sub-con­trac­tor with about 60 work­ers, of which 15 per cent have been cleared to work.</p>
    <p>Apart from crit­i­cal mass, Mr</p>
    <p>Heng said that con­struc­tion sites also need work­ers with dif­fer­ent skills. But work re­mains stalled at some sites be­cause those who have been cleared may not have spe­cific skills, he ex­plained.</p>
    <p>Mr Loo said hous­ing his work­ers in a range of ac­com­mo­da­tion, in­clud­ing con­struc­tion tem­po­rary quar­ters (CTQs) at the work­site it­self, has helped him to meet co­hort­ing re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>“But it is still a chal­lenge. If your work­site has no space, or if it is in a built-up en­vi­ron­ment, then you can’t build CTQs,” he noted.</p>
    <p>A BCA spokesman told ST yes­ter­day that it is look­ing at ways to fur­ther re­view the re­quire­ments, “fac­tor­ing in the feedback from in­dus­try”.</p>
    <p>BCA said it has been en­gag­ing as­so­ci­a­tions such as Scal, the Spe­cial­ist Trade Al­liance of Sin­ga­pore and the Dor­mi­tory As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore to help em­ploy­ers “co­hort” work­ers stay­ing in pur­pose-built dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Mr Hooi also had con­cerns that time spent on manda­tory swab test­ing for con­struc­tion work­ers at 14-day in­ter­vals – a crit­i­cal mea­sure to mit­i­gate out­breaks – will cre­ate bot­tle­necks. A new on­line sys­tem has been cre­ated to hope­fully ease the process.</p>
    <p>From to­day, BCA said, em­ploy­ers can make ap­point­ments for these pe­ri­odic swab tests on­line with the Health Pro­mo­tion Board.</p>
    <p>MOM said that mea­sures such as co­hort­ing and reg­u­lar test­ing help to en­sure a safe and con­trolled restart of work.</p>
    <p>“This will min­imise the risk of a resur­gence of in­fec­tions, and safe­guard the health of work­ers and our com­mu­nity at large. We seek the un­der­stand­ing of em­ploy­ers in this re­gard,” it added.</p>
    <p>ACCESSCODE IS­SUES</p>
    <p>Con­trac­tors have also raised is­sues with MOM’s AccessCode, which gives “green” sta­tus to work­ers al­lowed back to work.</p>
    <p>Mr Loo, who has more than 300 mi­grant work­ers, was one of sev­eral in the in­dus­try who had prob­lems with the sys­tem, with work­ers’ sta­tuses switch­ing er­rat­i­cally.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, MOM said it was no­ti­fied by some em­ploy­ers that their work­ers’ sta­tus had un­ex­pect­edly turned “red”, which means they can­not work.</p>
    <p>The is­sue was re­solved in an hour. Yes­ter­day, an MOM spokesman said the min­istry recog­nises that “the mul­ti­ple con­di­tions which de­ter­mine the AccessCode sta­tus pose a chal­lenge for em­ploy­ers and work­ers”.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand the chal­lenges faced by all par­ties, and are work­ing to­wards sim­pli­fy­ing the con­di­tions, mak­ing in­for­ma­tion more ac­ces­si­ble and en­hanc­ing user ex­pe­ri­ence,” said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>From July 12, for ex­am­ple, MOM in­tro­duced new fea­tures for em­ploy­ers to check AccessCode de­tails through an on­line ser­vice, Safe@Work, while work­ers can use the SGWorkPass app. MOM also re­moved a pre­vi­ous “grey” sta­tus to make the codes sim­pler.</p>
    <p>But the min­istry also said em­ploy­ers, op­er­a­tors and work­ers need to do their part by pro­vid­ing ac­cu­rate data for AccessCode, which is crit­i­cal for it to run smoothly even as en­hance­ments are made.</p>
