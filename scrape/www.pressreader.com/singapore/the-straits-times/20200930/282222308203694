    <p>Frasers Cen­tre­point Trust’s (FCT) pri­vate place­ment has closed about 2.8 times sub­scribed and priced at the bot­tom end of the range, with the up­size op­tion not ex­er­cised.</p>
    <p>It raised gross pro­ceeds of $575 mil­lion at an is­sue price of $2.35 per new unit, the real es­tate in­vest­ment trust’s (Reit) man­ager said yesterday be­fore mar­kets opened.</p>
    <p>The is­sue price rep­re­sents a 6.6 per cent dis­count to the vol­ume-weighted av­er­age price (VWAP) of $2.5171 based on all trades in FCT units last Fri­day up to the time the un­der­writ­ing agree­ment was signed on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The in­dica­tive price range for the pri­vate place­ment was $2.35 to $2.435 a unit. There was also an up­size op­tion to is­sue ad­di­tional units that would have lifted to­tal gross pro­ceeds to around $675 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The place­ment “drew strong de­mand from new and ex­ist­ing in­sti­tu­tional and other ac­cred­ited in­vestors”, said the man­ager.</p>
    <p>It had an­nounced on Mon­day that it was un­der­tak­ing an eq­uity fund rais­ing com­pris­ing the pri­vate place­ment and a non-re­nounce­able pref­er­en­tial of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>The pref­er­en­tial of­fer­ing’s is­sue price was also fixed at the low end of its range, at $2.34 per new unit – a 7 per cent dis­count to the VWAP.</p>
    <p>The in­dica­tive price range had been $2.34 to $2.42 per unit for the of­fer­ing, which is ex­pected to raise about $759.7 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>About 324.6 mil­lion new units will be is­sued, based on 290 pref­er­en­tial of­fer­ing units for ev­ery 1,000 ex­ist­ing units held as at 5pm on Oct 6.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, some 244.7 mil­lion new units will be is­sued un­der the pri­vate place­ment.</p>
    <p>In con­nec­tion with the pri­vate place­ment, the man­ager plans to de­clare – in re­spect of the ex­ist­ing FCT units – a cu­mu­la­tive dis­tri­bu­tion for the pe­riod from April 1 to the date im­me­di­ately be­fore the new units are is­sued un­der the place­ment. The pri­vate place­ment units are ex­pected to be is­sued on or around Oct 7.</p>
    <p>It will also de­clare a dis­tri­bu­tion of the Reit’s dis­tributable in­come that was ear­lier re­tained for the pe­ri­ods from Oct 1 to Dec 31 last year, and Jan 1 to March 31 this year.</p>
    <p>The ag­gre­gate dis­tri­bu­tion is es­ti­mated to be 4.485 cents per ex­ist­ing unit. This is made up of the cu­mu­la­tive dis­tri­bu­tion of about 2.804 cents and the re­tained dis­tri­bu­tion of about 1.681 cents.</p>
    <p>The man­ager said it will an­nounce the ac­tual dis­tri­bu­tion level later.</p>
    <p>As­sum­ing the pref­er­en­tial of­fer­ing is fully sub­scribed, the fund rais­ing’s gross pro­ceeds will to­tal about $1.33 bil­lion. This will com­prise more than 45 per cent of FCT’s present mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion, said Mr Richard Ng, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the Reit man­ager.</p>
    <p>About $1.02 bil­lion of this will fi­nance FCT’s ac­qui­si­tion of the rest of Asi­aRe­tail Fund, while $284.9 mil­lion will go into par­ing down debts.</p>
