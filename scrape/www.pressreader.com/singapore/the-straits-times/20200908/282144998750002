    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong’s prop­erty ty­coons and global firms, in­clud­ing Ernst & Young and Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), have re­ceived tens of mil­lions of dol­lars in gov­ern­ment-funded wage sub­si­dies meant to pro­tect jobs that would have other­wise been lost dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While the com­pa­nies are en­ti­tled to claim the sub­si­dies, the pay­ments to de­vel­op­ers con­trolled by bil­lion­aire ty­coons and fi­nan­cial firms em­ploy­ing highly paid pro­fes­sion­als have raised con­cerns about the fair­ness of the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>White-col­lar jobs have largely stayed in­tact dur­ing the cri­sis, with the brunt of the city’s re­ces­sion fall­ing heav­ily on low-skilled and lowly paid work­ers in the con­struc­tion, re­tail and food in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>To re­ceive the sub­si­dies, com­pa­nies just had to prom­ise not to re­duce head­count be­low a pledged num­ber, and use all the pro­ceeds to pay salaries.</p>
    <p>That stands in con­trast to wage sub­sidy pro­grammes in other coun­tries like Aus­tralia, where firms had to show a steep drop in rev­enue to qual­ify.</p>
    <p>In the United States, com­pa­nies in­clud­ing burger chain Shake Shack re­turned funds af­ter fac­ing back­lash for tap­ping a pro­gramme to sup­port small busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“This is very in­fu­ri­at­ing, the gov­ern­ment turns a blind eye and doesn’t in­tro­duce any un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits to many job­less work­ers who have trou­ble even sur­viv­ing,” said Hong Kong Con­fed­er­a­tion of Trade Unions chief ex­ec­u­tive Mung Siu Tat.</p>
    <p>“But it con­tin­ues to trans­fer ben­e­fits to big, pow­er­ful con­glom­er­ates with hand­some profits,” he said.</p>
    <p>Among com­pa­nies re­ceiv­ing sub­si­dies in the first tranche of the HK$80 bil­lion (S$14.1 bil­lion) pro­gramme were chair­man Vic­tor Li’s CK As­set Hold­ings, which got at least HK$22 mil­lion, and the bil­lion­aire Cheng fam­ily’s New World De­vel­op­ment, which re­ceived HK$56 mil­lion via its prop­erty arms to cover salaries be­tween June and last month, ac­cord­ing to gov­ern­ment data com­piled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>CK As­set and New World were named by the Hong Kong Re­tail Man­age­ment As­so­ci­a­tion as two of the five most un­co­op­er­a­tive land­lords in pro­vid­ing rental con­ces­sions to strug­gling ten­ants in April.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Hen­der­son Land De­vel­op­ment was paid HK$50 mil­lion through its prop­erty-re­lated sub­sidiaries, and prop­erty agency JLL got HK$173 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>CK As­set, Hen­der­son Land and JLL did not re­spond to mul­ti­ple calls and e-mail re­quest­ing com­ment.</p>
    <p>New World said it had not ap­plied for the pro­gramme, but its af­fil­i­ated com­pa­nies had done so based on their own op­er­a­tional needs and all sub­si­dies were di­rected to em­ploy­ees, par­tic­u­larly front-line staff, con­struc­tion work­ers and bus driv­ers.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s big prop­erty com­pa­nies have suf­fered losses, their lat­est earn­ings show.</p>
    <p>Wharf Real Es­tate In­vest­ment’s re­tail rental in­come slumped by al­most a third in the first half of the year, lead­ing to a loss and a HK$7.4 bil­lion hit to its port­fo­lio. Rev­enue from Hong Kong prop­erty sales at CK As­set plunged by more than 60 per cent.</p>
    <p>Even so, seven of Hong Kong’s real es­tate ty­coons sit atop a com­bined for­tune of US$120 bil­lion (S$164 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Bil­lion­aires In­dex.</p>
    <p>Hongkong Land Hold­ings, Cen­tral’s big­gest land­lord, ob­tained HK$22 mil­lion through the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The com­pany de­cided to par­tic­i­pate af­ter “a thor­ough re­view”, it said.</p>
    <p>It pledged to main­tain a head</p>
    <p>count of at least 830 em­ploy­ees and launch a HK$100 mil­lion re­lief fund to help peo­ple most af­fected by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment hand­outs are based on 50 per cent of ac­tual wages, with a cap of HK$9,000 per em­ployee each month.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic, com­ing af­ter months of so­cial un­rest, has ex­posed the cracks in Hong Kong’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The city, one of the most ex­pen­sive and un­equal in the world, has lit­tle in the way of wel­fare.</p>
    <p>The most di­rect fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance that Hong Kong work­ers have re­ceived dur­ing the pan­demic was a one-time HK$10,000 cash hand­out given to all res­i­dents aged 18 and above.</p>
    <p>Job losses have largely been con­cen­trated in low-skilled labour as the virus shut­downs and travel re­stric­tions smash the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Un­em­ploy­ment in re­tail, ac­com­mo­da­tion and food services has more than dou­bled in the past year, climb­ing to 10.8 per cent in July. The con­struc­tion in­dus­try has the high­est pro­por­tion of work­ers – 11.3 per cent – out of a job.</p>
    <p>Most of the de­vel­oper sub­sidiaries that ap­plied for sub­si­dies do not specif­i­cally em­ploy con­struc­tion work­ers, ex­cept one en­tity owned by New World.</p>
    <p>Other re­cip­i­ents of Hong Kong’s sub­si­dies in­clude ac­count­ing gi­ants Ernst & Young and KPMG, and large law firms Mayer Brown and Dea­cons, as well as Hong Kong­based Bank of East Asia.</p>
    <p>No­tably ab­sent from the list of firms re­ceiv­ing sub­si­dies were the ma­jor Wall Street and Euro­pean banks.</p>
    <p>“How com­pa­nies be­have in the pan­demic will af­fect their brand value in years to come,” said Mr Paul Smith, a for­mer global pres­i­dent of the CFA In­sti­tute, the global as­so­ci­a­tion of in­vest­ment pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies that ap­pear greedy and ac­cept gov­ern­ment money when they don’t need to will be dam­aged.”</p>
