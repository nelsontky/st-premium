    <p>Three clas­sic films in the Amoy dialect will be avail­able on­line as part of this year’s Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Film Fes­ti­val, as it moves par­tially on­line amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val, to be held from Oct 2 to 11, will host both phys­i­cal and dig­i­tal screen­ings of 33 films, in­clud­ing the three clas­sic movies.</p>
    <p>The an­nual event is or­gan­ised by the Sin­ga­pore Film So­ci­ety (SFS) and the Cen­tre for Chi­nese Stud­ies at Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences.</p>
    <p>They are part­ner­ing with FilmGarde Bugis+ for the phys­i­cal screen­ings and Shaw Ki­noLounge for the on­line pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence for the fes­ti­val on Wed­nes­day, SFS chair­man Ken­neth Tan says: “This is a very im­por­tant mile­stone be­cause, even post-pan­demic, the new tech­nol­ogy that al­lows us to present a fes­ti­val in this hy­brid for­mat is here to stay.</p>
    <p>“This gives film-mak­ers, or­gan­is­ers and au­di­ences more op­tions when pre­par­ing and at­tend­ing a fes­ti­val.”</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val will open with Changfeng Town by Chi­nese fe­male in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor Wang Jing.</p>
    <p>A nos­tal­gic drama set in an imag­i­nary Chi­nese town, the film is co-pro­duced by Sin­ga­porean film­maker Tay Bee Pin. It re­ceived the Bu­san In­ter­na­tional Film Fes­ti­val’s Asian Cin­ema Fund for script devel­op­ment in 2016.</p>
    <p>The film will be avail­able both on­line and in the cin­ema – the only one in the fes­ti­val to screen both on­line and off­line.</p>
    <p>There will be an on­line ques­tio­nand-an­swer ses­sion for the film on Oct 5. All 15 ques­tion-and-an­swer ses­sions dur­ing the fes­ti­val will be com­pli­men­tary.</p>
    <p>Aside from this Sin­ga­pore-China pro­ject, there are also two made-in­Sin­ga­pore films by lo­cal di­rec­tors in the line-up.</p>
    <p>The English-lan­guage Re­pos­ses­sion by Goh Ming Siu and Scott Hill­yard and a short film named Kua Bo by Ang Qing Sheng will both air dur­ing the fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>For Goh and Hill­yard, this is the first time their film will be screened in Sin­ga­pore after trav­el­ling around the in­ter­na­tional film fes­ti­val cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>Billed as a so­cial and psy­cho­log­i­cal drama about a man who loses his job, Re­pos­ses­sion stars lo­cal act­ing vet­er­ans such as Ger­ald Chew, Amy Cheng and Si­vaku­mar Palakr­ish­nan.</p>
    <p>Mu­sic for the film was made by Teo Wei Yong, who won Best Orig­i­nal Film Score at last year’s Golden Horse Awards for A Land Imag­ined (2018).</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val also worked with Taiwan Film In­sti­tute and lo­cal film re­searcher Yeo Min Hui to se­lect three clas­sic films in the Amoy dialect, a Hokkien dialect sim­i­lar to South­ern Min Tai­wanese dialect.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo says the films will of­fer a glimpse into the Amoy film in­dus­try, which ex­isted from 1948 to 1966. The films were made in</p>
    <p>Hong Kong but dis­trib­uted mainly in places such as Taiwan, where the Amoy dialect is un­der­stood.</p>
    <p>These three films, sub­ti­tled in both English and Chi­nese, will be avail­able for free view­ing on Vimeo from Oct 3 to 9.</p>
    <p>They star vet­eran Hong Kong ac­tress Ling Po and lo­cal singer­ac­tress and “Hokkien Queen” Chong Set Png, bet­ter known as Zhuang Xue­fang.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple don’t know, but Ling Po got her start in Amoy dialect films before she moved on to star in ma­jor Hong Kong films,” says Ms Yeo.</p>
    <p>Other ti­tles in­clude Tai­wanese crime flick The Gangs, The Os­cars, And The Walk­ing Dead (2019), star­ring Roy Chiu, and Heavy Crav­ing (2019), a film about an obese woman, which won fe­male lead Money Cai the award for Best New Tal­ent at the Taipei Film Awards last year.</p>
    <p>The fes­ti­val will close with the ho­mo­sex­u­al­ity-themed Hong Kong drama Suk Suk, which won Best Film at the 26th Hong Kong Film Crit­ics So­ci­ety Awards.</p>
