    <p>My hibis­cus used to bloom very of­ten. How­ever, for the past two months, I see flower buds but they do not bloom. What is wrong?</p>
    <p>Linda Lim</p>
    <p>Hibis­cus are sun-lovers and the lack of growth in your plant may in­di­cate it is not re­ceiv­ing suf­fi­cient sun­light. You will need to grow it in a place where it can get at least six hours of direct sun­light.</p>
    <p>If the sun has shifted its path at this time of the year, you may want to move the plant – it is grown in a pot which makes mov­ing eas­ier.</p>
    <p>The plants are also heavy feed­ers and you will need to reg­u­larly feed yours with fer­tiliser to boost growth and pro­mote flow­er­ing.</p>
    <p>The drop­ping of flow­ers could be due to plant stress. En­sure that the plant is ad­e­quately wa­tered. Do not let the root zone dry out to­tally or be wet all the time. Also, avoid grow­ing it in a con­stantly windy place which can dry out the plant.</p>
    <p>Bud drop could also be due to an in­fes­ta­tion by thrips. These pests can be erad­i­cated with ap­pli­ca­tion of a pes­ti­cide called spinosad.</p>
