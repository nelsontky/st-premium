    <p>Amid the Euro­pean foot­ball trans­fer dead­line day hus­tle and bus­tle, Sin­ga­pore striker Ikhsan Fandi also se­cured a late move within the Nor­we­gian sec­ond tier, go­ing from Rau­foss to FK Jerv on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>He told The Straits Times: “I’m very ex­cited to meet the team and fin­ish the sea­son off well. I hope I can find my form again and start scor­ing goals, be an im­por­tant player for Jerv to help the club win more games.”</p>
    <p>The 21-year-old agreed terms to play for Jerv un­til the end of 2022, mak­ing him the first lo­cal foot­baller to play pro­fes­sion­ally for two Euro­pean clubs. It is un­der­stood Jerv will pay Rau­foss a pack­age worth more than US$50,000 (S$68,000) with a sell-on clause.</p>
    <p>Jerv coach Arne Sand­sto said: “In Ikhsan Fandi we get a young, promis­ing and sought-af­ter player. He is strong on the head, good with the ball, is nim­ble and a good fin­isher. We have se­cured an al­ready good player with ex­cit­ing po­ten­tial.”</p>
    <p>Founded in 1921, Jerv are based in Grim­stad, a south­ern Nor­we­gian mu­nic­i­pal­ity 270km from the cap­i­tal Oslo. While the Wolver­ines have never played in the top tier, they were cham­pi­ons of the fourth and third tiers in 2013 and 2014 and have played in the sec­ond tier since. Their best fin­ish was third in 2016.</p>
    <p>They are cur­rently 12th in the 16-team league af­ter 16 matches with 18 points, six be­hind eighth­placed Rau­foss, who have played three games more.</p>
    <p>With 23 goals, Jerv have the sec­ond-worst scor­ing record in the di­vi­sion along with KFUM. Bot­tom side Kongsvinge­r have 20.</p>
    <p>Ikhsan will be ex­pected to pro­vide the goals that can give them a late push for a top-six place, which would put them in the play-offs.</p>
    <p>He said: “I will al­ways be grate­ful to Rau­foss for giv­ing me my first taste of com­pet­i­tive foot­ball in Europe. Since day one, ev­ery­one at Rau­foss treated me well and I’ve made many good friends here. I also want to thank the fans for their sup­port.</p>
    <p>“The big­ger goal is to play in the top tier but for now I’m just fo­cused on work­ing hard and get­ting back my scor­ing ways. If I do very well, then doors will open.”</p>
    <p>He could make his de­but in Jerv’s No. 99 shirt to­day at HamKam and may come up against his for­mer em­ploy­ers Rau­foss on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Ikhsan signed for Rau­foss last year, scor­ing six goals in 28 ap­pear­ances (12 starts), av­er­ag­ing a goal ev­ery 215 minutes, in his de­but sea­son in Europe.</p>
    <p>Af­ter over­com­ing a knee in­jury and ill­ness this sea­son, he made 11 ap­pear­ances (four starts), and scored a goal in the 3-1 win over Asane in Au­gust to snap a se­v­engame win­less streak as Rau­foss, who then went six matches un­beaten be­fore their 2-0 loss to HamKam on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>He came off the bench in the 52nd minute in his last game for Rau­foss be­fore the Jerv move.</p>
    <p>Sources say he had been fielded out of po­si­tion in a wing-back role this sea­son, and Rau­foss coach Chris­tian Johnsen was not pleased with Ikhsan’s trav­el­ling for in­ter­na­tional duty last sea­son.</p>
    <p>While this is a move across the sec­ond tier, a change of en­vi­ron­ment and a new chal­lenge will still be good for his de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to his agent Navjot Singh Brar, sev­eral top-tier sides in Nor­way, Den­mark, Swe­den and Poland have been mon­i­tor­ing his client’s progress.</p>
    <p>He added: “We could have moved him to the top di­vi­sion, but he wouldn’t be the first choice there right now. FK Jerv is a good step as he needs to play reg­u­larly. It’s not a step down, but a step in the right di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>“If he can get more goals to his CV from the sec­ond tier, he will re­ceive much bet­ter of­fers from the top.”</p>
    <p>Ikhsan was close to sign­ing for two-time Nor­we­gian cham­pi­ons Start, af­ter he scored in a 2-0 friendly win over sec­ond-tier Grorud dur­ing a trial in March, but the coro­n­avirus dis­rup­tion and en­su­ing fi­nan­cial con­cerns meant the move col­lapsed.</p>
    <p>His father Fandi Ah­mad, who played for Dutch side Gronin­gen from 1983 to 1985, told ST: “It is good for Ikhsan to move to a team where the coach trusts him to play in his best po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing proven him­self in the sec­ond di­vi­sion last sea­son, he has to con­tinue work­ing hard for a reg­u­lar start­ing and con­tribut­ing role at his new club, so he can get to where he wants to be even­tu­ally.”</p>
