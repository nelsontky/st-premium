    <p>The lawyer de­fend­ing na­tional wa­ter agency PUB against a law­suit from a wo­man who fell into an open man­hole five years ago ac­cused her of fak­ing her men­tal ill­ness yes­ter­day in an on­go­ing trial.</p>
    <p>Mr K. An­parasan made the con­tention af­ter not­ing that while Madam Chan Hui Peng, 47, was warded at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health (IMH) in July, she had the pres­ence of mind to ask for her mo­bile phone to li­aise with her lawyers about the case.</p>
    <p>He also said she was able to make ar­range­ments for the an­nual re­turns of the fam­ily com­pany to be filed with the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity (Acra).</p>
    <p>Madam Chan, a char­tered ac­coun­tant, fell into a 1.8m-deep man­hole on Dec 1, 2015, while she was walk­ing on a foot­path in Si­mon Road near Ko­van.</p>
    <p>She is seek­ing about $5 mil­lion in dam­ages, al­leg­ing that the ac­ci­dent caused her to suf­fer post-trau­matic stress dis­or­der and schizophre­nia, in ad­di­tion to a frac­tured an­kle.</p>
    <p>Be­tween June 29 and July 25 this year, she was forcibly warded at the IMH af­ter she threw a bam­boo pole out of the win­dow fol­low­ing an ar­gu­ment with her hus­band, who she said was pos­sessed.</p>
    <p>Mr An­parasan, who acts for PUB’s in­sur­ers, re­ferred to clin­i­cal notes to point out that she was lu­cid enough to ask for her phone on July 16.</p>
    <p>But Madam Chan told the court: “I’ve been in­side for three weeks with­out con­tact­ing a soul out­side, my lawyers are look­ing des­per­ately for me.”</p>
    <p>She said she was al­lowed to use her phone only un­der staff su­per­vi­sion, to re­trieve con­tact de­tails.</p>
    <p>Madam Chan said her hus­band had used her phone to send text mes­sages to a com­pany direc­tor re­gard­ing the Acra fil­ing. She also pointed out that the clin­i­cal notes showed that when she was warded, she did not think she had schizophre­nia. “I thought I was well but the doc­tors thought I was not and they did not want to let me go home,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr An­parasan also re­ferred to notes from Sengkang Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal when he told the court that Madam Chan had im­per­son­ated her mother in a phone con­ver­sa­tion with hos­pi­tal of­fi­cials last year.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cials had called her home num­ber to talk to her mother, but the call was redi­rected to Madam Chan’s mo­bile phone. Madam Chan told the of­fi­cials she was against send­ing “her daugh­ter” to IMH and pre­ferred her to see her own pri­vate psy­chi­a­trist.</p>
    <p>Con­fronted about this yes­ter­day, Madam Chan said she could not re­mem­ber. “When I’m in psy­chosis, I do not know what is real and not real.” Mr An­parasan said it was a “con­ve­nient ex­cuse”. The trial con­tin­ues.</p>
