    <p>Fresh fears have arisen that the pan­demic could be pro­longed af­ter new strains of Sars-CoV-2, the coro­n­avirus that causes Covid-19, were detected last month. The good news is that there is no ev­i­dence that the new strains, thought to have orig­i­nated in Eng­land and South Africa, are dead­lier or more re­sis­tant to vac­cines. What is ev­i­dent is that the new strains are more trans­mis­si­ble. One study has shown that the new vari­ant in­creases the re­pro­duc­tion, or R, ra­tio – the av­er­age num­ber of peo­ple an in­fected per­son in­fects – by be­tween 0.4 and 0.7. An added source of worry is that it has been spread­ing more quickly among all age groups, in­clud­ing young adults and se­condary school-age chil­dren. The con­cerns are un­der­stand­able, and height­ened vig­i­lance and con­tain­ment ef­forts will be needed in what has been a year-long bat­tle that has over­whelmed hos­pi­tals, of­fi­cials and the man in the street.</p>
    <p>But the best de­fence against new strains re­mains the same: con­trol trans­mis­sion through test­ing, trac­ing, iso­lat­ing, wear­ing masks and ob­serv­ing safe dis­tanc­ing. Vac­cines de­vel­oped thus far have been aimed at the orig­i­nal strain of the coro­n­avirus but are thought to gen­er­ate a wide im­mune re­sponse that can also of­fer pro­tec­tion against mu­ta­tions. In­fec­tion rates, there­fore, ought to re­cede as vac­ci­na­tion drives make head­way in Asia, the United States and Europe, and new lock­downs and travel re­stric­tions rein in the win­ter surge in the North­ern Hemi­sphere.</p>
    <p>It is im­per­a­tive that along with pub­lic health ef­forts, the sci­en­tific com­mu­nity con­tin­ues to un­lock new in­for­ma­tion on how viruses mu­tate, how the mu­ta­tions spread and how they can be con­tained. Last week, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) called on na­tions to step up ge­nomic se­quenc­ing of the coro­n­avirus be­cause only through such ef­forts can new vari­ants be detected – this was how Bri­tain dis­cov­ered the B117 strain – and cop­ing strate­gies ad­justed. While mu­ta­tions are a nor­mal part of the evo­lu­tion of a pan­demic, they must be matched by quick and trans­par­ent shar­ing of data and best prac­tices. More than a year af­ter the virus was first detected in Wuhan, gaps re­main in the un­der­stand­ing of the scourge that has killed nearly two mil­lion peo­ple and felled economies world­wide.</p>
    <p>A WHO team will visit China this month to learn how the virus emerged and spread to hu­mans. With the im­mi­nent in­au­gu­ra­tion of US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den, the US-China ten­sions that have hob­bled this search may ease. The de­tailed epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions to be un­der­taken by the WHO team re­quire ac­cess and sup­port from China. The in­ten­tion must be to un­earth use­ful in­for­ma­tion, not to shovel blame. A pan­demic is, af­ter all, a shared con­cern. As 2020 showed, a lo­cal out­break any­where can soon mu­tate into a pan­demic in to­day’s in­ter­con­nected world.</p>
