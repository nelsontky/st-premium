    <p>A Sin­ga­porean free­lancers and self-em­ployed peo­ple with less means and fam­ily sup­port can re­ceive fi­nan­cial sup­port from the Self-Em­ployed Per­son In­come Re­lief Scheme (Sirs).</p>
    <p>The scheme dis­burses up to $9,000 in cash over three tranches to each el­i­gi­ble self-em­ployed per­son (SEP).</p>
    <p>The cri­te­ria for qual­i­fy­ing for the scheme in­clude hav­ing started work as a self-em­ployed per­son on or be­fore March 25, earn­ing a net trade in­come of not more than $100,000 and liv­ing in a prop­erty with an an­nual value of not more than $21,000.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat told Par­lia­ment last month that by the end of that month, more than 195,000 peo­ple would have re­ceived the three pay­outs, which are meant to tide them over till the end of the year.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has also said it will study the pos­si­bil­ity of ex­tend­ing the scheme.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for the in­come re­lief scheme are still open. The num­ber of tranches is not af­fected by the tim­ing of the ap­pli­ca­tion, and as long as you are el­i­gi­ble, you will re­ceive the pay­outs in three tranches.</p>
    <p>Self-em­ployed peo­ple who have marginally missed one of the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria, and are fac­ing dif­fi­cult cir­cum­stances, can still sub­mit an ap­pli­ca­tion for con­sid­er­a­tion by the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC), which han­dles ap­pli­ca­tions and ap­peals for the scheme.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the labour move­ment’s web­site, if you do not meet all the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria but face valid and ex­ten­u­at­ing cir­cum­stances, your ap­pli­ca­tion may still be ap­proved. But the pay­out may be mod­er­ated ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>If you did not meet the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria ini­tially but cir­cum­stances have changed, you can still ap­ply. But de­pend­ing on when your cir­cum­stances changed, you may not be en­ti­tled to all three pay­outs.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who have re­ceived govern­ment pay­outs un­der the scheme do not have to pay in­come tax on th­ese pay­outs, af­ter changes were made to the In­come Tax Act this month.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean and per­ma­nent res­i­dent free­lancers can also use the NTUC Train­ing Fund (SEPs) to claim an al­lowance of up to $11 an hour when at­tend­ing cer­tain cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude Skill­sFu­ture Se­ries cour­ses and ap­proved sec­tor­spe­cific train­ing pro­grammes such as those on set­ting up and run­ning a busi­ness, e-com­merce cam­paign man­age­ment and team sports per­for­mance anal­y­sis.</p>
    <p>The list of avail­able cour­ses can be found here: www.ntu­cle­arn­inghub.com/ntuc-train­ing-fund­seps/</p>
    <p>Self-em­ployed NTUC union mem­bers who be­came mem­bers on or be­fore March 1 will re­ceive a train­ing al­lowance of $11 an hour, while those who joined af­ter March 1 will re­ceive $10.50 an hour. Non-union mem­bers will re­ceive $10 an hour.</p>
    <p>Be­fore ap­ply­ing for a train­ing course, you will need a let­ter of el­i­gi­bil­ity from NTUC’s Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute or a let­ter show­ing that you qual­ify for Sirs.</p>
    <p>Upon com­plet­ing a course, you must sub­mit a claim for the train­ing al­lowance within 30 work­ing days, by Dec 31. So do take note that the course must end by Dec 31.</p>
    <p>Union mem­bers can also tap their yearly train­ing fund un­der the Union Train­ing As­sis­tance Pro­gramme as well as Skill­sFu­ture Credit to off­set course fees, says Ms Jean See, direc­tor of NTUC’s Free­lancers and Self-Em­ployed Unit (U FSE).</p>
    <p>“SEPs have started pro­vid­ing ser­vices and sup­port to busi­nesses that have piv­oted to hy­brid en­vi­ron­ments. Up­skilling SEPs’ dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­i­ties is a pri­or­ity and key to sus­tain­able and vi­able ca­reers,” she says.</p>
    <p>She also notes that for self-em­ployed peo­ple in the meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice) in­dus­try, the Event In­dus­try Re­silience Roadmap launched last month pro­vides the op­por­tu­nity for new and re­freshed ca­reer paths.</p>
    <p>NTUC, the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion of Con­ven­tion and Ex­hi­bi­tion Or­gan­is­ers and Sup­pli­ers and NTUC Learn­ingHub will be rolling out a train­ing pro­gramme in line with the ob­jec­tives of the road map for an emerg­ing role, SG SafeEvent Am­bas­sador. This is to pre­pare Mice in­dus­try work­ers for the grad­ual safe open­ing of events, says Ms See.</p>
    <p>Free­lancers look­ing for ca­reer guid­ance can ap­proach Work­force</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore through its Ca­reers Con­nect cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­ni­ties of free­lancers in var­i­ous sec­tors have also been of­fer­ing sup­port and ad­vice to one an­other, such as through the Face­book groups of profession­al as­so­ci­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms See says that NTUC U FSE and af­fil­i­ated as­so­ci­a­tions, such as the Na­tional In­struc­tors and Coaches As­so­ci­a­tion, Na­tional Pri­vate Hire Ve­hi­cles As­so­ci­a­tion and Na­tional Taxi As­so­ci­a­tion, have also been putting to­gether train­ing and sup­port pack­ages for their re­spec­tive com­mu­ni­ties, such as the Govern­ment-NTUC Driver Care Fund for pri­vate hire ve­hi­cle driv­ers.</p>
    <p>Those in­ter­ested can fol­low NTUC U FSE on Face­book at www.face­book.com/ntu­cufse for up­dates, she says.</p>
    <p>Ap­pli­ca­tions for the in­come re­lief scheme are still open. The num­ber of tranches is not af­fected by the tim­ing of the ap­pli­ca­tion, and as long as you are el­i­gi­ble, you will re­ceive the pay­outs in three tranches.</p>
