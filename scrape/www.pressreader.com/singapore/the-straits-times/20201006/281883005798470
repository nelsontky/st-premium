    <p>In­done­sia’s Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day passed into law a job cre­ation Bill that is aimed at spurring i nvestment but has drawn flak from unions which have threat­ened to strike.</p>
    <p>Seven of the nine fac­tions in Par­lia­ment sup­ported the Bill that al­lows em­ploy­ers to hire and fire with lower sev­er­ance pay and ben­e­fits as well as re­cruit work­ers on flex­i­ble work­ing hours.</p>
    <p>Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for the Econ­omy Air­langga Har­tarto said the new law would help curb un­em­ploy­ment and ben­e­fit the In­done­sian work­force, em­ploy­ers and the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“All this time, the prob­lems that have of­ten im­peded growth in in­vest­ment and job cre­ation in­cluded com­pli­cated and lengthy business li­cens­ing pro­cesses, un­friendly con­di­tions to in­vest­ment and difficulty in land pro­cure­ment,” Mr Air­langga said in a speech af­ter rat­i­fi­ca­tion of the leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Spokesman for the Gerindra party Heri Gu­nawan told the ple­nary ses­sion: “The new law will cre­ate jobs, at­tract more in­vest­ment and would in turn raise peo­ple’s wel­fare. Our Con­sti­tu­tion man­dates us to achieve such ob­jec­tives.”</p>
    <p>Gerindra was among the seven par­ties, in­clud­ing the In­done­sian Demo­cratic Party of Strug­gle and Golkar, that sup­ported adopt­ing the Bill. The three largest par­ties con­trol 51 per cent of the seats in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Only two par­ties – the Pros­per­ous Justice Party (PKS) and for­mer pres­i­dent Susilo Bam­bang Yud­hoy­ono’s Demo­cratic Party – re­jected the Bill. PKS spokesman Amin Ak said the Bill would dis­ad­van­tage labour­ers and work­ers and ben­e­fit only em­ploy­ers and com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment was re­ported to have orig­i­nally planned to vote on the Bill, a key ini­tia­tive of Pres­i­dent J oko Wi­dodo, on Thurs­day but brought it for­ward to head off a new round of street protests by unions which had called for a na­tional strike from to­day.</p>
    <p>“The ba­sic prob­lems of the Bill are it does not recog­nise min­i­mum wage... cuts sev­er­ance pay, makes re­trench­ment so easy,” said Mr Said Iqbal, chair­man of labour union KSPI.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Po­lice spokesman, Brigadier-Gen­eral Awi Setiy­ono, told re­porters yes­ter­day that the po­lice were not pro­hibit­ing demon­stra­tions, but would im­pose curbs to pre­vent large crowds from gath­er­ing to en­sure pub­lic safety.</p>
    <p>“The job of the po­lice is to pro­tect the peo­ple and en­sure they are safe from Covid-19... if there are crowds, who can guar­an­tee there will be no trans­mis­sion?” he said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment sub­mit­ted the Bill to Par­lia­ment in Fe­bru­ary for de­lib­er­a­tion, but it was set aside for re­view in April af­ter labour groups stepped up street protests. Par­lia­ment re­vived the mea­sure for de­lib­er­a­tion in July.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic slump due to the Covid-19 pan­demic has helped the gov­ern­ment’s push for the new reg­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>More than 3.7 mil­lion peo­ple have lost their jobs in In­done­sia, bring­ing the es­ti­mated to­tal of the un­em­ployed to 10.6 mil­lion or nearly 8 per cent of the 133 mil­lion work­ers in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The ba­sic prob­lems of the Bill are it does not recog­nise min­i­mum wage... cuts sev­er­ance pay, makes re­trench­ment so easy. MR SAID IQBAL, chair­man of labour union KSPI.</p>
