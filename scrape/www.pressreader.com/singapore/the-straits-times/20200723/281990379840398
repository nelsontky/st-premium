    <p>Around 400 of the 1,100 cof­fee shops is­land­wide have re­ceived the SG Clean cer­ti­fi­ca­tion since it was in­tro­duced in Fe­bru­ary, said the Pub­lic Hy­giene Coun­cil (PHC) yesterday.</p>
    <p>Due to the Covid-19 out­break, there is greater ur­gency for cof­fee shops to im­prove hy­giene and clean­li­ness stan­dards.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude hav­ing a spring­clean­ing regime and reg­u­larly sani­tis­ing fre­quent touch­points and food prepa­ra­tion ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor cof­fee shop op­er­a­tors such as Broad­way, S-11 and GHK have stated their com­mit­ment to work to­wards at­tain­ing the cer­ti­fi­ca­tion for all their re­spec­tive cof­fee shops.</p>
    <p>A study con­ducted by the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity that was re­leased in May found that pub­lic toi­let hy­giene stan­dards have de­clined sig­nif­i­cantly in lo­cal hawker cen­tres and cof­fee shops, with toi­lets in cof­fee shops be­ing com­par­a­tively dirt­ier.</p>
    <p>Mr Ed­ward D’Silva, chair­man of the PHC, said in a vir­tual press con­fer­ence yesterday that toi­lets in cof­fee shops are key contributo­rs to the over­all clean­li­ness and hy­giene of the cof­fee shop en­vi­ron­ment and added that “dirty and wet toi­lets are fer­tile breed­ing grounds for germs and viruses”.</p>
    <p>To en­sure ba­sic stan­dards of hy­giene at cof­fee shops, the PHC rec­om­mends that the Gov­ern­ment fund the up­grade of fa­cil­i­ties and ac­ces­sories to make cer­tain all toi­lets are reg­u­larly cleaned and equipped with a con­stant sup­ply of soap and toi­let pa­per.</p>
    <p>Sup­port and fund­ing should be pro­vided for clean­ers to at­tend train­ing work­shops reg­u­larly to up­skill and be more ef­fec­tive in their clean­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The PHC is work­ing with the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency to pro­vide more train­ing to its op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Broad­way F&B Man­age­ment has had 15 out of its 26 cof­fee shop out­lets cer­ti­fied with SG Clean and is work­ing to have the rest cer­ti­fied as well.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh Hung Kwang, chair­man of GHK Hold­ings, said the op­er­a­tor now has all its 11 cof­fee shop out­lets cer­ti­fied with SG Clean.</p>
    <p>To en­sure that hy­giene stan­dards are ad­hered to, the op­er­a­tor has in­creased the num­ber of clean­ers ros­tered each shift from two to three.</p>
    <p>Ta­bles are swiftly and thor­oughly wiped down after pa­trons have left and fre­quent spot checks are con­ducted to en­sure that all toi­lets are clean.</p>
    <p>GHK part­nered with the PHC’s Keep Viruses At Bay ini­tia­tive in Fe­bru­ary where cof­fee shop op­er­a­tors were en­gaged to step up clean­ing regimes and re­mind pa­trons to prac­tise good per­sonal hy­giene habits.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee Bee Wah, a former Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment for Nee Soon GRC, who was part of the Keep</p>
    <p>Viruses at Bay ini­tia­tive, said that it is para­mount for “cof­fee shop op­er­a­tors to con­tinue main­tain­ing high stan­dards of hy­giene now that phase two has com­menced and more Sin­ga­pore­ans are din­ing out in small groups”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Sin­ga­pore­ans should also do their share by “re­turn­ing their trays and uten­sils after meals, bin­ning used tis­sue and keep­ing the toi­let clean and dry”, she said.</p>
    <p>Ms Car­rie Tan, a newly elected MP for Nee Soon GRC, added: “We would like to en­cour­age res­i­dents to think about their cof­fee shops as an ex­ten­sion of their homes and do their part in keep­ing them clean.”</p>
    <p>Due to the Covid-19 out­break, there is greater ur­gency for cof­fee shops to im­prove hy­giene and clean­li­ness stan­dards... Ma­jor cof­fee shop op­er­a­tors such as Broad­way, S-11 and GHK have stated their com­mit­ment to work to­wards at­tain­ing the (SG Clean) cer­ti­fi­ca­tion for all their re­spec­tive cof­fee shops.</p>

The op&#xAD;er&#xAD;a&#xAD;tor is work&#xAD;ing to have its re&#xAD;main&#xAD;ing 11 cof&#xAD;fee shops cer&#xAD;ti&#xAD;fied as well.</p>
