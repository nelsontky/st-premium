    <p>The newly launched The Straits Times Vir­tual Run (STVR) presents a new chal­lenge for par­tic­i­pants, but one thing re­mains sim­i­lar to pre­vi­ous edi­tions of The ST Run: at­trac­tive prizes for lo­cal en­trants are still up for grabs in a lucky draw.</p>
    <p>This year’s l ucky draw grand prize is a Pana­sonic 55-inch HZ1000S 4K Ultra HD OLED TV set worth $3,699. It is the eighth con­sec­u­tive year that Pana­sonic is the ST Run’s pre­sent­ing spon­sor.</p>
    <p>ST sports ed­i­tor and STVR or­gan­is­ing chair­man Lee Yulin said: “Every year, our aim is to not just chal­lenge our par­tic­i­pants at var­i­ous lev­els but also to keep them en­gaged through a multi-faceted build-up pro­gramme or to re­ward them for their loy­alty in sign­ing up.</p>
    <p>“We are grate­ful that Pana­sonic has con­tin­ued its gen­er­ous sup­port for the ST Vir­tual Run this year.”</p>
    <p>Thanks to its OLED panel and smooth mo­tion per­for­mance, the HZ1000S de­liv­ers crisp im­ages, fresh colours and deep blacks. It also boasts a new Film­maker Mode, which presents films as the di­rec­tor in­tended. This ini­tia­tive is sup­ported by ma­jor di­rec­tors, in­clud­ing the likes of Christo­pher Nolan and Martin Scors­ese.</p>
    <p>The HZ1000S also comes with sup­port for HDR10+, Dolby Vi­sion and Dolby At­mos, and with its slim and min­i­mal­ist de­sign, the tele­vi­sion set will fit into any home.</p>
    <p>To com­mem­o­rate the news­pa­per’s 175th an­niver­sary, there will be two dis­tances of­fered for the STVR – 17.5km and 175km.</p>
    <p>The race pe­riod for the 17.5km run is Oct 9-18, while the 175km run will take place from Oct 19-Dec 17.</p>
    <p>En­try fees for past par­tic­i­pants of the ST Run are $15 (17.5km) and $20 (175km). Early-bird prices are $18 and $23 re­spec­tively, till Sept 11. Nor­mal rates (Sept 12-Oct 4) are $22 and $27.</p>
    <p>Run­ners are al­lowed to record their dis­tances over sev­eral ses­sions and at any out­door lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­tra­tion closes at 11.59pm on Oct 4.</p>
    <p>Those in­ter­ested can sign up at the ST Run web­site while the full terms and con­di­tions for the STVR’s var­i­ous giveaways and lucky draw can also be found at www.strait­stimes­run.com</p>
    <p>Lo­cal run­ners are de­fined as those who re­side in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
