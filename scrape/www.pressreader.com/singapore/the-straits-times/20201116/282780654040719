    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese ac­tor Akira Ku­bodera (left) has died in a sus­pected sui­cide at the age of 43, ac­cord­ing to the Ja­panese me­dia.</p>
    <p>Ku­bodera was found in a coma in his apart­ment in Tokyo last Friday and was pro­nounced dead after ar­riv­ing in hospi­tal. Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions by the po­lice showed that he had com­mit­ted sui­cide.</p>
    <p>His agency con­firmed his death in a press state­ment last Satur­day, adding that the death was so sud­den that both his fam­ily and the staff could not ac­cept it.</p>
    <p>Ku­bodera, who was born and grew up in Tokyo, was dis­cov­ered by a tal­ent agent when he was an un­der­grad­u­ate.</p>
    <p>He started out as a model in 1995, turn­ing to the stage in 1999 be­fore mov­ing on to tele­vi­sion se­ri­als in 2003. He was most fa­mous for play­ing the char­ac­ter Kun­zite in Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon (2003 to 2004), a TV adap­ta­tion of the manga se­ries Sailor Moon.</p>
    <p>He has also acted with late ac­tress Yuko Takeuchi in the movie Straw­berry Night (2013) and with late ac­tor Haruma Miura in the TV se­ries Last Cin­derella (2013).</p>
    <p>Ku­bodera’s in­come was said to have been se­verely af­fected by the coro­n­avirus pandemic due to a re­duc­tion in act­ing gigs. Last week, he pro­moted on so­cial me­dia his stage show which was to run in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese en­ter­tain­ment in­dus­try has been hit by a spate of sui­cides in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Takeuchi, 40, ac­tress Sei Ashina, 36, and ac­tor Takashi Fu­jiki, 80, were found dead in their re­spec­tive homes in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Miura, 30, was found dead in his home in July, while pro­fes­sional wrestler and re­al­ity se­ries Ter­race House star Hana Kimura died in May at age 22.</p>
