    <p>A cousin of Mustafa Cen­tre boss Mus­taq Ah­mad told the High Court yes­ter­day that his fa­ther came home cry­ing “like a baby” one day in 2004, af­ter mak­ing a will stat­ing that he held a 15.12 per cent stake in the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mr Fayyaz Ah­mad said his fa­ther, Mr Sam­sud­din Mokhtar Ah­mad, felt hurt and cheated by Mr Mus­taq, whom he treated as a son.</p>
    <p>Mr Mus­taq’s lawyer, Se­nior Coun­sel Alvin Yeo, ac­cused Mr Fayyaz of mak­ing up the story be­cause the con­tents of his fa­ther’s will would hurt his case.</p>
    <p>Mr Fayyaz and his brother An­sar are claim­ing a one-third share of the Mustafa busi­ness em­pire as well as as­sets owned by Mr Mus­taq.</p>
    <p>The case is be­ing heard to­gether with a suit brought against Mr Mus­taq and his fam­ily by his five stepsi­b­lings and their mother.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said Mr Sam­sud­din could have re­voked the will, but did not do so be­cause he be­lieved he was en­ti­tled only to a 15.12 per cent stake.</p>
    <p>Mr Sam­sud­din was a cousin of Mr Mus­taq’s mother Mom­ina.</p>
    <p>In 1973, he reg­is­tered a part­ner­ship with Mr Mus­taq’s fa­ther, Haji Mo­hamed Mustafa. Mr Mus­taq was added as a part­ner later.</p>
    <p>In 1989, Mr Sam­sud­din and Mr Mus­taq in­cor­po­rated Mo­hamed Mustafa & Sam­sud­din Co. Mr Mustafa and Mr Mus­taq’s wife were later added as share­hold­ers and direc­tors. Be­tween 1989 and 2001, Mr Mus­taq’s stake went from 51 per cent to 61.25 per cent while Mr Sam­sud­din’s went from 30 per cent to 15.12 per cent.</p>
    <p>Mr Fayyaz and his brother have ac­cused Mr Mus­taq of di­lut­ing their fa­ther’s in­ter­ests through “wrong­ful” share al­lot­ments. They al­lege that the de­fen­dants mis­ap­pro­pri­ated funds and paid them­selves ex­ces­sive direc­tors’ fees.</p>
    <p>Mr Mus­taq con­tends that he was the sole owner of the busi­ness who pro­vided for Mr Mustafa, Mr Sam­sud­din and their fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Fayyaz said that af­ter he asked Mr Mus­taq about his fa­ther’s will, Mr Mus­taq as­sured him that his fa­ther would get a onethird share. Mr Fayyaz said he re­layed this to Mr Sam­sud­din, who took Mr Mus­taq at his word.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said that af­ter Mr Sam­sud­din’s death in 2011, Mr Fayyaz signed af­fi­davits con­firm­ing that the 15.12 per cent stake in the firm was his only as­set in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Fayyaz said Mr Mus­taq went back on his word that “ev­ery­one will get an equal share” af­ter the doc­u­ments were signed.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeo said: “I sug­gest that it is you who had gone back on your word... You had got­ten greedy and would like to claim more than what the Sam­sud­din es­tate is en­ti­tled to.” Mr Fayyaz dis­agreed.</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues.</p>
