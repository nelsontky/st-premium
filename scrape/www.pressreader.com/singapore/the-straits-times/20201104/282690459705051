    <p>SEOUL • The wildly in­fec­tious and re­lent­lessly repet­i­tive chil­dren’s song, Baby Shark, be­came the most-watched YouTube video on Mon­day, with more than seven bil­lion plays.</p>
    <p>The bane of par­ents and teach­ers world­wide, the South Kore­apro­duced song has gone from the realm of chil­dren’s YouTube to a global vi­ral sen­sa­tion, with a catchy and ad­dic­tive melody buoyed by a hyp­not­i­cally colour­ful video.</p>
    <p>Baby Shark Dance, the English­language ver­sion of the song, clocked more than seven bil­lion views on YouTube at around noon on Mon­day, de­thron­ing singer</p>
    <p>Luis Fonsi and rap­per Daddy Yan­kee’s Des­pac­ito as the most­watched video on the plat­form.</p>
    <p>The ubiq­ui­tous chil­dren’s song and ear­worm, first up­loaded to YouTube in June 2016, is a remix of an Amer­i­can camp­fire song by the Seoul-based pro­duc­tion com­pany Pink­fong.</p>
    <p>Its YouTube suc­cess paved its route into the global mu­sic charts, reach­ing the num­ber 32 spot on the Bill­board Hot 100 in Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>It has picked up plenty of adult fans along its way to global vi­ral fame: the Wash­ing­ton Na­tion­als baseball team took it up as an an­them and went on to win the World Se­ries last year, prompt­ing the White House to play the tune dur­ing the cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong su­per­star Aaron Kwok in­cluded his iconic dance steps from his songs I Love You For­ever and Gen­er­a­tion Next in the Baby Shark Dance Chal­lenge, as he said his daugh­ter Chantelle, three, loves the danc­ing in Baby Shark more than his own danc­ing.</p>
    <p>Baby Shark has also been pressed into anti-pan­demic ser­vice, with a coro­n­avirus-themed ver­sion, Wash Your Hands, teach­ing chil­dren the im­por­tance of per­sonal hy­giene.</p>
    <p>There was a plan to open a Baby Shark-themed kids’ in­door play­ground in Sin­ga­pore this year, but this has been delayed by Covid-19 and no new date has been set, Mr Ryan Lee, co-founder of edu­tain­ment com­pany SmartS­tudy, the South Korean com­pany be­hind Pink­fong, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Two of the last four tracks to hold the most-played record on YouTube are South Korean – rap­per Psy’s mega-hit Gang­nam Style held the ti­tle for more than three years un­til it was de­throned by rap­per Wiz Khal­ifa and singer Charlie Puth’s See You Again.</p>
