    <p>Sin­ga­pore is plan­ning to start talks on air travel bub­bles with coun­tries that have man­aged the Covid-19 pan­demic well. The ini­tia­tive, an­nounced in Par­lia­ment ear­lier this week, rep­re­sents an­other push to re­open the na­tion’s bor­ders, re­sume gen­eral travel on a lim­ited ba­sis, and re­vive its dec­i­mated air hub. The statis­tics be­hind the im­per­a­tive are dire in­deed. Com­pared with the time be­fore the out­break of the coro­n­avirus, Changi Air­port is serv­ing a woeful 1.5 per cent of the usual pas­sen­ger vol­ume and 6 per cent of the usual num­ber of pas­sen­ger flights. Sin­ga­pore now has di­rect flights to only 49 cities in the world, com­pared with 160 ear­lier. It has also dropped from be­ing the sev­enth busiest air­port in the world for in­ter­na­tional pas­sen­ger traf­fic to the 58th. Sin­ga­pore Air­lines might not still ex­ist to­day with­out the re­cent ma­jor re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion ex­er­cise and, even so, it faces im­mense chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has mag­ni­fied the vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties of the avi­a­tion sec­tor in Sin­ga­pore, a thriv­ing global city which is, how­ever, bereft of do­mes­tic air travel. The sta­tus quo sim­ply is not sus­tain­able. Hence the need for bold and in­no­va­tive steps which re­veal that Sin­ga­pore could be in the van­guard of the re­open­ing of global air travel. To that end, tourists and other trav­ellers who come in un­der a pro­posed ar­range­ment would be tested for the coro­n­avirus, but would not have to be quar­an­tined or fol­low a fixed itin­er­ary. Since test­ing is the key to unlocking air travel, a ded­i­cated Covid-19 test­ing lab­o­ra­tory would be set up at Changi Air­port in the next few months.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage is clear: Sin­ga­pore is mov­ing fast to re­store pas­sen­ger traf­fic and re­vive its po­si­tion as an air hub, but in a con­trolled and safe way. The ini­tia­tive re­flects a sit­u­a­tion which has changed for the bet­ter since bor­ders were closed six months ago. Covid-19 is largely un­der con­trol both in the com­mu­nity and in for­eign worker dor­mi­to­ries. That track record is a mat­ter of re­as­sur­ance to coun­tries and re­gions that are seek­ing part­ners to re­store avi­a­tion links. Of course, the planned air bub­bles would re­flect the im­per­a­tive of re­main­ing safe and man­ag­ing the risks. Given the gen­eral im­prove­ment of the coro­n­avirus sit­u­a­tion in some coun­tries, Sin­ga­pore should be able to min­imise the risk of im­port­ing the dis­ease while max­imis­ing the eco­nomic op­por­tu­ni­ties of re­viv­ing Changi’s air hub sta­tus.</p>
    <p>Ad­mit­tedly, its re­newed wel­come of in­ter­na­tional trav­ellers does not mean that other coun­tries would re­cip­ro­cate au­to­mat­i­cally or im­me­di­ately. That is their pre­rog­a­tive. How­ever, Sin­ga­pore could act as a point of ref­er­ence for other coun­tries in how to open bor­ders and re­vive the econ­omy by unit­ing with na­tions with a trusted track record of tack­ling the pan­demic. That would help the econ­omy take cen­tre stage again.</p>
