    <p>•</p>
    <p>China and Rus­sia have strongly crit­i­cised the United States for what they de­scribed as uni­lat­eral sanc­tions and un­jus­ti­fied crack­downs on the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, in the se­cond phone con­ver­sa­tion since last month be­tween Chi­nese For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi and and his Rus­sian coun­ter­part Sergei Lavrov, Mr Wang said the US runs counter to this era’s trends and fre­quently threat­ens and im­poses uni­lat­eral sanc­tions, which could leave it with one of the more dis­grace­ful records in the world.</p>
    <p>China is will­ing to work with Rus­sia and the global com­mu­nity to staunchly pro­tect the ba­sic norms of in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions and en­sure world fair­ness and jus­tice, said Mr Wang, who is also state coun­cil­lor.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the call, Mr Lavrov stressed the need to op­pose US moves that sab­o­tage mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and boy­cott the Amer­i­can crack­down on Rus­sia and China.</p>
    <p>He called for cham­pi­oning in­ter­na­tional law, safe­guard­ing the com­mon in­ter­ests of the two coun­tries and pro­tect­ing world­wide sta­bil­ity and co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang and Mr Lavrov noted that next year marks the 20th an­niver­sary of the sign­ing of the China-Rus­sia Treaty of Good Neigh­bourli­ness, Friend­ship and Co­op­er­a­tion, and both sides stated their readi­ness to deepen strate­gic links and pro­mote each other’s de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang said the two coun­tries achieved many hard-won re­sults by help­ing each other through the Covid-19 pan­demic and of­fer­ing mu­tual sup­port in prag­matic co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Also, they led in­ter­na­tional col­lab­o­ra­tion in the fight to tackle the health cri­sis, res­o­lutely fought the “politi­ci­sa­tion of the virus” and jointly safe­guarded world and re­gional se­cu­rity and sta­bil­ity, Mr Wang noted.</p>
    <p>The great fre­quency of re­cent of­fi­cial con­tacts be­tween the two coun­tries serves as a clear re­sponse to the ur­gency of ad­vanc­ing mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, re­cov­ery and jus­tice at a time when the world is still trapped in the pan­demic and over­shad­owed by pro­tec­tion­ism, of­fi­cials and ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry’s ex­ter­nal se­cu­rity com­mis­sioner Cheng Guop­ing said the China-Rus­sia com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic co­op­er­a­tive part­ner­ship in the new era – led by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping and Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin –</p>
    <p>has reached a record high and is a model for a new type of great power re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>The two lead­ers have en­gaged in fre­quent com­mu­ni­ca­tion through video links and tele­phone con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>The bi­lat­eral re­la­tion­ship serves as a strong pil­lar amid a chang­ing global landscape, Mr Cheng said when he met Rus­sian Am­bas­sador to China, Mr An­drey Denisov, on Dec 3.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter said the two sides should bol­ster pol­icy com­mu­ni­ca­tion and co­or­di­na­tion to jointly</p>
    <p>tackle shared global and re­gional se­cu­rity chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, the two coun­tries also con­ducted their se­cond joint aerial pa­trol in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion, their de­fence min­istries an­nounced.</p>
    <p>The pa­trol, part of the an­nual co­op­er­a­tion plan be­tween the two mil­i­taries, does not tar­get any third party, and the war­planes did not en­ter the airspace of any third coun­try, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
