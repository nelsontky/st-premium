    <p>United States Demo­cratic Party pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den has said lit­tle on for­eign pol­icy – and what lit­tle he has said is alarm­ingly sim­plis­tic, says global af­fairs cor­re­spon­dent Jonathan Eyal (be­low).</p>
    <p>Even when judged by the un­usual stan­dards of this pan­demic year, the re­cently con­cluded Demo­cratic Party con­ven­tion in the United States was de­cid­edly odd.</p>
    <p>Gone was the razzmatazz of pre­vi­ous con­ven­tions, with their packed vast are­nas and over­sized peo­ple in gar­ish clothes shout­ing their ap­proval. In­stead, we were treated to the equiv­a­lent of a TV in­fomer­cial, a tightly scripted va­ri­ety show stretch­ing over four long days, com­plete with fake stu­dio back­drops and pre-recorded ap­plause, all de­signed to per­suade us that what we were wit­ness­ing was not some pro­duc­tion put to­gether by a few stu­dio tech­ni­cians and an elec­tronic con­sole, but a mas­sive get-to­gether of the en­tire Amer­i­can na­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Joe Bi­den, the Democrats’ pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee and Ms Ka­mala Har­ris, his run­ning mate, grinned broadly and waved en­er­get­i­cally at TV mon­i­tors sup­pos­edly con­nect­ing them to “real” Amer­i­can vot­ers who, of course, were care­fully hand­picked and ex­haus­tively trained for their brief brush with celebrity sta­tus.</p>
    <p>And then came Mr Bi­den’s key­note ac­cep­tance speech, which most of the US me­dia im­me­di­ately praised for hav­ing “ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions”, con­ve­niently ne­glect­ing to point out that his speech was de­liv­ered to a crowd of 30 jour­nal­ists sit­ting in a stu­dio, and sworn to si­lence.</p>
    <p>Even the lat­est ses­sion of China’s Na­tional Peo­ple’s Congress held in the Great Hall of the Peo­ple in Bei­jing in May was more spon­ta­neous than the lat­est Demo­cratic con­ven­tion; at least the Chi­nese deputies were treated to a live band play­ing pa­tri­otic mu­sic, rather than the canned va­ri­ety served by Amer­ica’s Democrats.</p>
    <p>Yet, the most ex­tra­or­di­nary de­tail about this en­tire episode is the fact that the man who in less than three months from now may well end up be­ing elected as the next US pres­i­dent had said ab­so­lutely noth­ing about what his for­eign pol­icy pri­or­i­ties will be.</p>
    <p>In­deed, in the four days of the con­ven­tion, not one per­son ad­dressed the topic of China, the mat­ter which – as any pol­i­cy­maker in Wash­ing­ton read­ily ad­mits – will, for bet­ter or worse, be the defin­ing chal­lenge for an in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>We are forced, there­fore, to piece to­gether a pre­dic­tion of the for­eign pol­icy of a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion from the few state­ments which both he and those close to him have made.</p>
    <p>And the pic­ture which emerges from this hap­haz­ard re­con­struc­tion is hardly re­as­sur­ing. For al­though the for­eign and se­cu­rity pol­icy team which sur­rounds Mr Bi­den is cer­tainly ex­pe­ri­enced, there is no ev­i­dence that the would-be pres­i­dent or his as­so­ciates are will­ing to grap­ple with some of the fun­da­men­tal crises that are cer­tain to await a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Of course, Mr Bi­den ben­e­fits from the fact that he is not Mr Don­ald Trump; that in it­self makes him a cred­i­ble fu­ture US pres­i­dent in the eyes of many lead­ers around the world. He won’t sur­prise Amer­ica’s friends by tout­ing deals at their ex­pense, for Mr Bi­den does un­der­stand the im­por­tance of al­liances, even for a great power like the US.</p>
    <p>He won’t bang the ta­ble at in­ter­na­tional sum­mits as Mr Trump has done. He will lis­ten to his mil­i­tary and in­tel­li­gence chiefs’ ad­vice. He will not an­nounce new poli­cies via Twit­ter in the mid­dle of the night. And he won’t run a per­pet­ual war against both Congress and his own of­fi­cials, as Mr Trump has done.</p>
    <p>For al­though Mr Bi­den likes – as all pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates do dur­ing elec­toral pe­ri­ods – to present him­self as a “new broom” in Wash­ing­ton, the re­al­ity is that he is the ul­ti­mate in­sider. In­deed, were he to be elected on Nov 3, he would be the pres­i­dent with the most ex­ten­sive govern­ment ex­pe­ri­ence to en­ter the White House since Mr Ge­orge H. W. Bush’s elec­tion more than three decades ago.</p>
    <p>More sig­nif­i­cantly still, much of Mr Bi­den’s ex­pe­ri­ence is pre­cisely on for­eign and se­cu­rity pol­icy mat­ters. Dur­ing a leg­isla­tive ca­reer span­ning al­most half a cen­tury, he was not merely a prom­i­nent mem­ber of the US Se­nate’s pow­er­ful For­eign Af­fairs Com­mit­tee, but also chaired it on no less than three dif­fer­ent oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>And, of course, he was vice-pres­i­dent for eight years, a job which put him at the heart of govern­ment. So, even if he says lit­tle about his for­eign pol­icy pri­or­i­ties now, he has a long record by which he can be judged.</p>
    <p>RECORD ON FOR­EIGN POL­ICY</p>
    <p>The snag is that not every­thing about his record is re­as­sur­ing. First, like all politi­cians, he is fond of em­bel­lish­ing past achieve­ments. He claims, for in­stance, that he was in­stru­men­tal in urg­ing the US to use its mil­i­tary power to stop the geno­cide in Yu­goslavia dur­ing the 1990s; the claim is, to put it po­litely, an ex­ag­ger­a­tion.</p>
    <p>He also claims that he of­fered to sup­port Ge­or­gia when it was at­tacked by Rus­sian forces in 2008, but very few of the US diplo­mats who dealt with the cri­sis at that time have such a rec­ol­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>What we do know, how­ever, is that he op­posed the first Gulf war of 1991 – widely ac­knowl­edged to have been the jus­ti­fi­able war that led to Kuwait’s lib­er­a­tion from Iraqi oc­cu­pa­tion – but sup­ported the 2003 sec­ond Gulf war which is now re­garded as a cat­a­strophic er­ror; Mr Bi­den is prob­a­bly the only se­nior US politi­cian to end up apol­o­gis­ing for get­ting both these votes wrong.</p>
    <p>We also know that – just like Mr Trump to­day – he urged Mr Barack Obama back in 2009 to get all the US troops out of Afghanista­n re­gard­less of what hap­pened to that blighted coun­try, that he op­posed the dar­ing US raid which killed Osama bin Laden and that he ad­vo­cated let­ting Iraq split into dif­fer­ent small eth­nic statelets, an­other pol­icy which, if im­ple­mented, would have been a dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Robert Gates, who served as the sec­re­tary of de­fence un­der both former pres­i­dents Ge­orge W. Bush and Obama, un­char­i­ta­bly recorded in his mem­oirs pub­lished a few years ago that Mr Bi­den “has been wrong on nearly every ma­jor for­eign pol­icy and na­tional se­cu­rity is­sue over the past four decades”.</p>
    <p>RECORD ON TRADE</p>
    <p>Nor is Mr Bi­den’s record on trade that stel­lar. Dur­ing the Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion, he voted against the trade agree­ments with Singapore and Chile, for in­stance, and to this day, he prefers to avoid sub­stan­tive dis­cus­sion on his fu­ture trade poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Of course – and as the warn­ings ac­com­pa­ny­ing of­fers of fi­nan­cial in­vest­ments put it – past per­for­mance is not nec­es­sar­ily a guide to the fu­ture. Peo­ple learn from their pre­vi­ous mis­takes, and what can­di­dates say or do not say dur­ing elec­tions should not be treated as gospel.</p>
    <p>On trade, for in­stance, it is pos­si­ble to ar­gue that Mr Bi­den’s cur­rent si­lence over what he will do if elected is more en­cour­ag­ing and in­tel­lec­tu­ally hon­est than Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton’s half-hearted claim that, if elected, she’d aban­don the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship or, in­deed, Mr Obama’s 2008 elec­toral pledge that he’d rene­go­ti­ate the North Amer­i­can Free Trade Agree­ment, a prom­ise he promptly dumped once he en­tered the White House.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is that Mr Bi­den is now silent on many other key for­eign pol­icy ques­tions, and what he does say re­mains alarm­ingly sim­plis­tic.</p>
    <p>POS­SI­BLE ‘MAN­I­FESTO’</p>
    <p>All as­pir­ing US pres­i­dents pub­lish dur­ing their elec­toral cam­paigns an ar­ti­cle in the For­eign Af­fairs, the bi­ble of the US for­eign pol­icy es­tab­lish­ment; that is in­vari­ably seen as their man­i­festo.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s re­cently pub­lished con­tri­bu­tion grandly pro­claims that, un­der him, “Amer­i­can must lead again”.</p>
    <p>But how is this to be done? By or­gan­is­ing “dur­ing my first year in of­fice” a global sum­mit for democ­racy which will “hon­estly con­front na­tions that are back­slid­ing and forge a com­mon agenda”. One can only re­call how suc­cess­ful that “ex­port­ing democ­racy” model was in the past, to guess how catchy it will be in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den also prom­ises to “get tough” with China; by now, that rep­re­sents the con­sen­sus in</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton. But un­like Mr Trump, the Demo­cratic can­di­date prom­ises to do so as part of an al­liance of na­tions.</p>
    <p>Yet, he says noth­ing about how he will mo­bilise those al­lies, or what the US would do if – as is very likely – the al­lies dis­agree on what ap­proach to take on China.</p>
    <p>And then, there is Iran and North Korea, Amer­ica’s two as­pir­ing nu­clear foes. Mr Bi­den prom­ises that un­der him, the US will re­turn to the nu­clear deal then Pres­i­dent Obama signed with Iran back in 2015, pro­vided Iran “re­turns to strict com­pli­ance” with that deal, an in­di­rect ac­knowl­edge­ment that Iran has not re­spected the Obama ar­range­ment of which he is so proud. And if Iran does not play ball? No an­swer.</p>
    <p>On North Korea, Mr Bi­den prom­ises no more Trump-style sum­mits with Mr Kim Jong Un, un­less the North Korean leader agrees to a “com­plete and ver­i­fi­able dis­man­tle­ment” of his nu­clear arse­nal. And if Py­ongyang re­fuses? Mr Bi­den prom­ises to “reim­pose sanc­tions”, con­ve­niently ig­nor­ing the fact that these sanc­tions are al­ready in place and have failed to stop North Korea’s nu­clear quest.</p>
    <p>It may be that the Bi­den cam­paign will get more spe­cific on for­eign pol­icy is­sues in the weeks to come. But at least for the mo­ment, the Demo­cratic can­di­date seems to ig­nore just how se­ri­ously full his for­eign plate will be, should he end up sit­ting in the Oval Of­fice.</p>
    <p>For his task is not merely to re­verse the con­se­quences of some of Mr Trump’s way­ward be­hav­iours, but rather to un­der­stand that Wash­ing­ton sim­ply can­not re­turn to the com­fort­able as­sump­tions of the past.</p>
    <p>The first re­al­ity he must grap­ple with is that glob­al­i­sa­tion does not work in Amer­ica’s favour. For it was not Mr Trump who in­vented the back­lash to glob­al­i­sa­tion; rather, he merely ben­e­fited from a back­lash which is there, and to which Mr Bi­den must also re­spond.</p>
    <p>Nor are the in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions which Mr Bi­den wants to re­vive likely to help with global gov­er­nance un­less the ques­tion of China’s place in all such schemes is an­swered, some­thing on which the Bi­den cam­paign prefers to re­main silent.</p>
    <p>And with US dom­i­nance be­ing chal­lenged in every re­spect and in every tech­no­log­i­cal field, in­clud­ing the mil­i­tary, sim­ply hint­ing at sav­ings on mil­i­tary sav­ings with­out spec­i­fy­ing what one means is an ex­er­cise in ir­rel­e­vance.</p>
    <p>In short, merely promis­ing to “lead again” by re­stat­ing the old cer­tain­ties of the past will not work.</p>
    <p>The real ques­tion is whether the Demo­cratic can­di­date who has spent the past half cen­tury climb­ing to the top of Amer­i­can pol­i­tics by re­gur­gi­tat­ing these old cer­tain­ties now un­der­stands that he must dis­card them if he fi­nally makes it to the White House.</p>
