    <p>Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered com­pany Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group was cat­a­pulted into the global lime­light when news broke ear­lier this month that it had put in a takeover bid for New­cas­tle United Foot­ball Club.</p>
    <p>BN Group was formed fol­low­ing a merger be­tween the Dorr Group founded by Sin­ga­pore busi­ness­men Ter­ence Loh and Nel­son Loh, and Chi­nese jew­ellery mer­chant Evan­ge­line Shen’s Bel­la­graph Group.</p>
    <p>It was set up on July 20 with a paid-up cap­i­tal of $20 mil­lion, said the group. Among other things, it claimed to own more than 30 en­ti­ties across 100 coun­tries in ma­jor busi­ness fields in­clud­ing fi­nance, sports, health­care, lux­ury goods, en­ter­tain­ment and robotics. It said it is Paris­based and worth an es­ti­mated US$12 bil­lion (S$16 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Its pub­lic­ity photos in­cluded those of the co-founders with for­mer Amer­i­can pres­i­dent Barack Obama.</p>
    <p>Over the week­end, the group ad­mit­ted to Reuters it had doc­tored photos of Mr Obama to make them look as if he had at­tended a meet­ing with its ex­ec­u­tives in Paris.</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, the photos were taken at a char­ity gala event in Sin­ga­pore last De­cem­ber spon­sored by Novena Global Life­care, which was founded by the Loh cousins.</p>
    <p>Other in­con­sis­ten­cies have also surfaced in BN Group’s pub­lic­ity ma­te­rial and so­cial me­dia posts, in­clud­ing its claim that it op­er­ates more than 10,000 pri­vate jets. Another claim is that Hy­dra X is one of its en­ti­ties and it is sup­posed to be im­ple­ment­ing a trad­ing sys­tem for the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change. Reuters re­ported that Hy­dra X and SGX have de­nied the claims.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic­ity ma­te­rial for BN Group de­scribes the Dorr Group as hav­ing “over US$4 bil­lion in as­sets”.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen’s Bel­la­graph Group in­cludes Bel­la­graph Jew­elry, and a press state­ment in June said it is “most no­tably famed for hold­ing the world record for high­est ever on­line sin­gle sale trans­ac­tion of US$102 mil­lion (across all prod­uct cat­e­gories glob­ally)”.</p>
