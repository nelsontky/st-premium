    <p>China could aban­don the nine-dash line – which un­der­pins its claim of up to 90 per cent of the dis­puted wa­ters in the South China Sea – with­out hurt­ing its long-term in­ter­ests, said a China military ex­pert.</p>
    <p>In fact, aban­don­ing the line would boost its soft power and help the coun­try win friends in Asean, said Dr Li Nan, a vis­it­ing se­nior re­search fel­low at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s East Asian In­sti­tute (EAI).</p>
    <p>“This is the time for China to give up the nine-dash line. It doesn’t work in its in­ter­est,” Dr Li said yes­ter­day at a we­bi­nar on the mar­itime dis­pute or­gan­ised by the EAI and the ISEAS – Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>The speak­ers at The South China Sea Dis­pute: United States-China Ri­valry, Law­fare and the Prospects for a Code of Con­duct, mostly aca­demics from both think-tanks, agreed that Asean and China were un­likely to is­sue guide­lines on ac­tions in the South China Sea by next year’s dead­line, given the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Run-ins be­tween China and claimant Asean states, such as the Philip­pines and Viet­nam, in the dis­puted wa­ters have in­creased this year.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions are also es­ca­lat­ing be­tween China and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter lodged a protest with Bei­jing ear­lier this month af­ter a Chi­nese coast­guard ship spent two days in In­done­sia’s ex­clu­sive eco­nomic zone, off the Natuna Is­lands.</p>
    <p>China’s nine-dash line, which is in con­flict with in­ter­na­tional mar­itime law but is used by Bei­jing to claim wa­ters around the Natu­nas, is at the heart of the dis­pute.</p>
    <p>Dr Li said that Chi­nese coast­guards have had to en­force their jurisdicti­on ac­cord­ing to the ninedash line and “that caused all the prob­lems with the coastal states”.</p>
    <p>He added that aban­don­ing the nine-dash line will serve China’s in­ter­ests, in­clud­ing boost­ing the coun­try’s soft power.</p>
    <p>He pointed out that China had con­ceded parts of the nine-dash line be­fore, in the early 1950s, when it re­moved two dashes as a ges­ture to its com­mu­nist com­rades in north­ern Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>But Chi­nese lead­ers might face a back­lash from in­sti­tu­tions such as the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA) if they make sim­i­lar con­ces­sions again, he said.</p>
    <p>“What re­ally drives Chi­nese for­eign pol­icy is not so much public opin­ion as it is in­sti­tu­tion dy­nam­ics,” he added.</p>
    <p>“If China re­ally de­cides to mod­ify the nine-dash line... I don’t think the PLA will like that.”</p>
    <p>Dr Li’s com­ments drew re­buke from co-pan­el­list Le Hong Hiep, a fel­low at ISEAS– Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>“China did erase two dashes... but again, in 2010, it added an­other dash in the East China Sea. So, I’m not sure whether China re­ally makes con­ces­sions re­gard­ing the nine-dash line,” said Dr Le.</p>
    <p>“But I to­tally agree with Dr Li that it would be a great idea and good for China’s soft power if it dropped the nine-dash line al­to­gether,” he added.</p>
    <p>Also on the panel were EAI’s Dr Lam Peng Er and Dr Ryan Clarke, ISEAS– Yu­sof Ishak In­sti­tute’s Ms Hoang Thi Ha and Dr Ian Storey, and Mr Julio Amador III from the Philip­pines’ Ate­neo Pol­icy Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>In 2016, an in­ter­na­tional tri­bunal in the Per­ma­nent Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion in The Hague ruled that China’s claim in the South China Sea – us­ing the nine-dash line – had no le­gal ba­sis, af­ter the Philip­pines brought the case to the court.</p>
    <p>The US ex­plic­itly sided with the rul­ing for the first time in July this year.</p>
