    <p>Anti-gov­ern­ment pro­test­ers faced off against roy­al­ists in in­ner Bangkok yes­ter­day, dur­ing one of King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s so­journs in Thai­land.</p>
    <p>The day, how­ever, ended largely peace­fully as brief scuf­fles were swiftly bro­ken up by the po­lice be­fore a con­voy bear­ing the King was due to pass.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers later marched over 1km from the Democ­racy Mon­u­ment to the Gov­ern­ment House, tak­ing a de­tour to avoid a road used by the royal mo­tor­cade.</p>
    <p>Some later con­gre­gated around a con­voy car­ry­ing Queen Suthida, flash­ing a three-fin­ger anti-dic­ta­tor­ship salute as it passed. It was one of the baldest chal­lenges to the palace yet from a move­ment that is de­mand­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion be amended, fresh elec­tions be held and the monar­chy be re­formed.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s protest was the lat­est among over 200 demon­stra­tions across the coun­try since Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers say the 2017 Con­sti­tu­tion is de­signed to keep Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha in power.</p>
    <p>The former coup leader now leads a coali­tion gov­ern­ment that con­tin­ues to keep sev­eral former junta lead­ers in key po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers also want to trim King Va­ji­ra­longkorn’s power back in line with his of­fi­cial sta­tus as a con­sti­tu­tional monarch.</p>
    <p>Leg­is­la­tors were due to ini­ti­ate the process of amend­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion late last month, but de­layed it through a last-minute mo­tion dur­ing a joint ses­sion of the Lower and Up­per Houses.</p>
    <p>The next Par­lia­ment sit­ting will take place on Nov 1.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands turned up for yes­ter­day’s protest and oc­cu­pied a street out­side the Gov­ern­ment House. But they ap­peared to be out­num­bered by yel­low-shirt roy­al­ists, who lined the streets near the Grand Palace.</p>
    <p>One of them, 60-year-old Sir­ima Phakawan, dis­missed the pro­test­ers’ de­mands.</p>
    <p>“The monar­chy has noth­ing to do with the Con­sti­tu­tion. Only politi­cians are af­fected by it,” she said.</p>
    <p>Just around the cor­ner from the Gov­ern­ment House, a 50-year-old pro­tester who wished to be known as Noo told The Straits Times: “I came to sup­port the young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>This is about their life, their fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>The protest lead­ers have ral­lied un­der sev­eral names over the past few months, lately set­tling on Khana Rat­sadon, in a nod to the group of mil­i­tary of­fi­cers and civil­ians who over­threw the ab­so­lute monar­chy in 1932.</p>
    <p>Since as­sum­ing the throne in 2016, the King has taken per­sonal own­er­ship of an es­ti­mated over US$40 bil­lion (S$54.2 bil­lion) worth of as­sets man­aged by the Crown Prop­erty Bureau, as well as com­mand of two in­fantry reg­i­ments.</p>
    <p>The monarch spends much of his time in Ger­many, rais­ing ques­tions about the le­gal­ity of his in­struc­tions from abroad.</p>
    <p>Ger­man For­eign Min­is­ter Heiko Maas, an­swer­ing a law­maker’s ques­tion last week, said King Va­ji­ra­longkorn should not be con­duct­ing pol­i­tics from Ger­many.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, pro­test­ers gath­er­ing near Bangkok’s Democ­racy Mon­u­ment got into a scuf­fle with po­lice de­ployed there ahead of the pass­ing of a royal con­voy. Po­lice ar­rested 21 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>On Twit­ter that night, one of the top trend­ing hash­tags was a phrase sharply crit­i­cal of the King.</p>
    <p>Asean’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy, weighed down by a slower than ex­pected tourism re­cov­ery amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, is pro­jected by the World Bank to con­tract by 8.3 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>While the gov­ern­ment has been try­ing to boost con­sump­tion through tourism sub­si­dies, co-pay­ment schemes and tax breaks, the hard­ship has stoked public re­sent­ment over royal ex­pen­di­ture, which takes up al­most 9 bil­lion baht (S$393 mil­lion) in this year’s bud­get.</p>
    <p>SUP­PORT­ING THE YOUTH</p>
    <p>I came to sup­port the young peo­ple. This is about their life, their fu­ture. ’’</p>
    <p>NOO, a 50-year-old pro­tester.</p>
