    <p>After work­ing in the whole­sale trade for about seven years, Ms April Peck was ap­proached with an of­fer of a role as re­tail op­er­a­tions man­ager.</p>
    <p>De­spite hav­ing no ex­pe­ri­ence in re­tail, Ms Peck, 44, de­cided to take a leap of faith and made a ca­reer switch last De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Just as she was get­ting used to her new role at lux­ury watch re­tailer All Watches, the Covid-19 pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>To fur­ther help her tran­si­tion into her role and equip her with the cus­tomer ser­vice skills needed, the com­pany en­rolled her in a pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme for re­tail pro­fes­sion­als in March.</p>
    <p>Ms Peck said she found the pro­gramme use­ful. “It’s very rel­e­vant, and the train­ers use real-life ex­am­ples to help you have a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of how re­tail op­er­a­tions are car­ried out.”</p>
    <p>The two-month cir­cuit breaker to stem the spread of Covid-19, dur­ing which re­tail stores had to stay closed, forced re­tail­ers to trans­form their busi­ness mod­els, she said.</p>
    <p>“We were al­ready on e-com­merce, but we were not re­ally do­ing it ag­gres­sively. So the cir­cuit breaker prompted us to take dras­tic ac­tion to be dig­i­tally ready,” said Ms Peck, who is mar­ried with two chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“When our stores re­opened in mid-June, we had learnt a lot dur­ing the pre­vi­ous 21/ months, and</p>
    <p>2 had a bet­ter per­spec­tive on car­ry­ing out work such as hav­ing vir­tual con­sul­ta­tions for cus­tomers.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the chal­lenges ahead for the re­tail sec­tor, Ms Peck is ex­cited about her ca­reer prospects.</p>
    <p>“I’m al­ready 44, so it’s not easy for me to join a new in­dus­try and I’m try­ing my best to adapt. But so long as my skill sets are still rel­e­vant, I will want to stay in this in­dus­try.”</p>
