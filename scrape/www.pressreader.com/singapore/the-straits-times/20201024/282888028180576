    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish pop leg­end Paul McCart­ney re­vealed on Wed­nes­day that he will re­lease the third in a tril­ogy of self-ti­tled solo al­bums this year, af­ter res­ur­rect­ing un­fin­ished mu­sic dur­ing the coro­n­avirus lockdown.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Bea­tle’s lat­est record, McCart­ney III, which will be un­veiled on Dec 11, fol­lows months of work at his home stu­dio in Sus­sex, south­ern Eng­land, on pre­vi­ously started and new songs.</p>
    <p>They have all been writ­ten, pro­duced and per­formed by the singer, who said he had not been plan­ning to re­lease an al­bum this year, un­til the pan­demic forced him to stay at home for months.</p>
    <p>“I had some stuff I’d worked on over the years, but some­times time would run out and it would be left half-fin­ished, so I started think­ing about what I had,” he said, in com­ments pub­lished by Bri­tain’s Press As­so­ci­a­tion news agency.</p>
    <p>“Each day, I’d start record­ing with the in­stru­ment I wrote the song on and then grad­u­ally layer it all up, it was a lot of fun,” added McCart­ney, 78.</p>
    <p>“It was about mak­ing mu­sic for your­self, rather than mak­ing mu­sic that has to do a job. So, I just did stuff I fan­cied do­ing. I had no idea this would end up as an al­bum.”</p>
    <p>Its re­lease co­in­cides with the 50th an­niver­sary of his first self­ti­tled solo en­deav­our, re­leased as the “Fab Four” went their sep­a­rate ways in 1970. A fol­low-up, McCart­ney II, came a decade later.</p>
    <p>The lat­est col­lec­tion of tracks is mostly built from live takes of McCart­ney on vo­cals and gui­tar or pi­ano, be­fore over­dub­bing with his bass play­ing and drum­ming, the Press As­so­ci­a­tion re­ported.</p>
    <p>It said the singer had re­turned to an un­re­leased track from the early 1990s, When Win­ter Comes, which was co-pro­duced by The Bea­tles’ late pro­ducer Ge­orge Martin.</p>
    <p>Pic­tures for the al­bum were shot by McCart­ney’s daugh­ter, pho­tog­ra­pher Mary McCart­ney, with more images by his nephew Sonny McCart­ney and some that he took him­self on his phone.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing the pho­tog­ra­phy in the fam­ily mir­rors how the pop icon il­lus­trated ear­lier solo al­bums, with his late wife Linda McCart­ney shoot­ing the art­work for McCart­ney II.</p>
    <p>She also took many of the photos dis­played on the gate­fold cover of the 1970 McCart­ney al­bum.</p>
