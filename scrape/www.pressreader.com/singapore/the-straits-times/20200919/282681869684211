    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>You need to lis­ten – oth­er­wise, a re­la­tion­ship could turn sour. Some­one needs to know you care, even if you can­not do any­thing.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You have to take care of your phys­i­cal or men­tal health if you want to make the most of the time you have.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your good en­ergy is still flow­ing strongly, so you should be able to lift any­one’s spir­its. Ce­ment your rep­u­ta­tion as a fun-lov­ing friend.</p>
    <p>Cancer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You are likely go­ing through a con­flict with some­one – but there is noth­ing to be afraid of. Let your true feel­ings be known.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>You need to step up and take ac­tion. It is one of those days when you are sure you need to shake up your life in some way.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>It is a good time for big pur­chases – as long as you are not the only one mak­ing the de­ci­sion. Ask your mate or busi­ness part­ner for ad­vice.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Some­one you have been try­ing to at­tract for some time is pay­ing at­ten­tion to you – this is go­ing to be good for you.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>There is no need to take ac­tion – you have ev­ery­thing lined up. Kick back and let the gears grind on their own.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) Your laugh­ter is the key to things. What­ever the sit­u­a­tion, those around you should have their moods di­rectly af­fected.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19) An au­thor­ity fig­ure over­steps his bound­aries, but do not get too worked up over it as things are likely go­ing to be back to nor­mal soon.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You can­not just stick to your rou­tines – you have to break out and try some­thing new. You are sure to find some­thing big.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Make sure you are giv­ing your debt prob­lem all the men­tal re­sources you can give it – and throw as much of your in­come at it as pos­si­ble.</p>
