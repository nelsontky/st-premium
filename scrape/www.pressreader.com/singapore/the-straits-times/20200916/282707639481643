    <p>Waste­land, re­leased in 1988, launched the post-apoc­a­lyp­tic role­play­ing game (RPG) genre that spawned spir­i­tual successors such as Fall­out and The Last Of Us.</p>
    <p>Its se­quel, Waste­land 2, took 27 years to ar­rive. Thank­fully, we had to wait just five years for Waste­land 3.</p>
    <p>Pick­ing up from the events of Waste­land 2, Waste­land 3 con­tin­ues the story of the Desert Rangers, a group of sur­vival­ists who help sur­vivors and main­tain or­der in a post-nu­clear war United States.</p>
    <p>After an am­bush, you are the sole sur­vivor in a team of Desert Rangers dis­patched to make con­tact with the Pa­tri­arch, ruler of Colorado.</p>
    <p>The Pa­tri­arch has of­fered the Desert Rangers plenty of re­sources and sup­plies to re­build their Ari­zona base in re­turn for help with some fam­ily prob­lems.</p>
    <p>Ba­si­cally, he wants you to cap­ture his three chil­dren – each of whom has his or her own agenda, but who are all look­ing to usurp the Pa­tri­arch as the re­gional leader.</p>
    <p>The Desert Rangers soon find them­selves en­tan­gled in a web of de­ceit, be­trayal and twists, with many fac­tions to en­gage in the freez­ing Colorado waste­lands.</p>
    <p>But first, you need to build up your base by re­cruit­ing non-player char­ac­ters (NPCs), such as a doc­tor to take care of the med­i­cal bay, a quar­ter­mas­ter to stock the ar­moury and other per­son­nel to manage the mess hall, garage and brig.</p>
    <p>Thus, you start by do­ing the eas­ier quests to get you up to speed with the game­play. As you get stronger, you can re­cruit more mem­bers for your squad.</p>
    <p>You can have up to six mem­bers (in­clud­ing your­self) in your squad at any one time. I highly rec­om­mend mix­ing char­ac­ters with dif­fer­ent skill sets – such as medic, barter, charisma and com­puter hack­ing – into your ac­tive squad.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause you have a higher chance of fin­ish­ing your quests through charm or force and com­ing out on top of bat­tles through ranged or melee at­tacks.</p>
    <p>I am happy to have “an­i­mal whis­perer” as a skill, as it al­lows me to re­cruit a cat named Ma­jor Tom­cat, which turns out to be amaz­ingly pow­er­ful dur­ing com­bat.</p>
    <p>There are plenty of ar­mour and weapons to col­lect, ei­ther by loot­ing downed en­e­mies or buy­ing from shops in the towns you visit.</p>
    <p>Like its pre­de­ces­sor, Waste­land 3 is played via a third-per­son iso­met­ric view with turn-based com­bat game­play.</p>
    <p>Each squad mem­ber has a cer­tain num­ber of ac­tion points, which are needed for ac­tions such as mov­ing and fir­ing a weapon. You have to plan prop­erly dur­ing bat­tle.</p>
    <p>To move be­tween ma­jor cities, you have to travel in an ar­moured ve­hi­cle called Ko­diak. Re­mem­ber to up­grade it, as the up­grades might come i n handy dur­ing ran­dom en­coun­ters as you tra­verse the waste­lands.</p>
    <p>All of the lo­ca­tions in Colorado are beau­ti­fully crafted and unique – you will find your­self tak­ing time to ex­plore each town and city.</p>
    <p>Talk to NPCs to get in­for­ma­tion and new quests – some­thing which I en­joy as the voice ac­tors have done a great job of breath­ing life into their char­ac­ters.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, it is through these in­ter­ac­tions that you are able to move the grip­ping story for­ward and af­fect its fi­nal out­come. There are times when I ac­tu­ally pause the game and pon­der what I should say or do next.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, I mull over whether I should tip off the folks in a town about an im­pend­ing attack or join the attack my­self – a choice that would yield much bet­ter re­turns in terms of re­sources. Such dilem­mas are aplenty.</p>
    <p>One quib­ble I have with the game is the long load­ing time – up to 30 sec­onds – when en­ter­ing new ar­eas. But maybe this time is for you to think about your choices.</p>
    <p>An­other is­sue I have is that while the story is en­gag­ing, it is packed with cliches such as can­ni­bals and crazy clowns, which are of­ten found in post-apoc­a­lyp­tic lit­er­a­ture.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ti­tle eas­ily pro­vides at least 40 hours of game­play. And if you are the kind who likes to fin­ish ev­ery side-quest, you might be look­ing at 60 hours or more of fun. More­over, you can al­ways re­play with dif­fer­ent choices to see what the fi­nal out­come will be.</p>
    <p>In short, Waste­land 3 is the best RPG of the year so far.</p>
