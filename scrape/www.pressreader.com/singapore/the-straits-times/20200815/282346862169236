    <p>• Former Ul­ti­mate Fight­ing Cham­pi­onship (UFC) heavy­weight cham­pion Daniel Cormier in­tends to re­claim the belt he lost to Stipe Mio­cic when the two face off again in the main event of UFC 252 to­day.</p>
    <p>But re­gard­less of the re­sult, the 41-year-old says that this time, he is re­tir­ing for good.</p>
    <p>Cormier is re­turn­ing to the oc­tagon for a third fight against fel­low Amer­i­can Mio­cic, from whom he won the heavy­weight belt in 2018 only to lose it in the re­match just over a year later. It was then that the former light-heavy­weight ti­tle holder first walked away from mixed mar­tial arts (MMA).</p>
    <p>He has not fought since last Au­gust and he be­lieves he has ac­com­plished ev­ery­thing in the sport.</p>
    <p>“I’m go­ing into the fight with the idea that this is the last time I’ll walk into the oc­tagon. I’m very ex­cited,” the Louisiana na­tive said from his Las Ve­gas train­ing camp.</p>
    <p>“I’m con­tent with my ca­reer. I’ve had as good a ca­reer as I ever could have ex­pected, so win or lose – with all the in­ten­tions to win, as I do on Satur­day – I think this will be the last time you see me fight in the UFC.”</p>
    <p>Cormier started out as a wrestler, win­ning the US National and PanAmer­i­can Cham­pi­onships and com­pet­ing at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games be­fore switch­ing to MMA.</p>
    <p>He went on to hold the UFC lightheavy­weight and heavy­weight ti­tles si­mul­ta­ne­ously be­fore re­tir­ing after his loss to Mio­cic to con­cen­trate on his me­dia ca­reer.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the prom­ise of a tril­ogy fight and one last shot at glory has lured him back from his hia­tus. To re­claim the belt, he will have to find a way of deal­ing with the crip­pling body shots that the 37-year-old Mio­cic ham­mered him with en route to a tech­ni­cal knock­out win.</p>
    <p>“Any time a punch like that lands as many times as it did in such a short time frame, of course you’re go­ing to worry about it a lit­tle bit,” he said. “I just have to limit the dam­age on the shots that I take. We’ve been dili­gent in our prepa­ra­tion, know­ing that he’s go­ing to try to go to that well again, and when he does, we have to... make him pay for throw­ing that body shot.”</p>
    <p>After 22 wins and two losses as a pro­fes­sional, Cormier says he will have no re­grets when he re­tires.</p>
    <p>“I’m blessed to have had so many op­por­tu­ni­ties to fight for cham­pi­onships as I have had.”</p>
