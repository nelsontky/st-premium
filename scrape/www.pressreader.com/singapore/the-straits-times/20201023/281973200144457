    <p>Com­pa­nies here will re­ceive greater sup­port in im­ple­ment­ing work­place learn­ing with the launch of a new road map that aims to en­sure the con­tin­ued rel­e­vance of mid-ca­reer work­ers.</p>
    <p>As part of the ef­fort to de­velop the train­ing and adult ed­u­ca­tion (TAE) sec­tor, the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences’ In­sti­tute for Adult Learn­ing (IAL) launched a five-year strate­gic road map yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A third Na­tional Cen­tre of Ex­cel­lence for Work­place Learn­ing will be open­ing this year to help de­velop work-team ca­pa­bil­i­ties and work­place learn­ing in en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre will lend its ex­per­tise to small and medium-sized en­ter­prises and help them in­te­grate work­place learn­ing prac­tices and sys­tems for busi­ness re­silience, such as by help­ing them build in­house train­ing sys­tems.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, the IAL will un­der­take stud­ies on life­long and work­place learn­ing to de­ter­mine their im­pact on dig­i­tal in­no­va­tion. It will also re­search the im­pact of glob­al­i­sa­tion and tech­no­log­i­cal shifts on learn­ing and em­ploy­ment out­comes.</p>
    <p>The in­sti­tute will cre­ate new av­enues for en­ter­prises to ac­cess re­sources, such as its net­work of TAE prac­ti­tion­ers, to help those seek­ing to im­ple­ment work­place learn­ing and trans­for­ma­tion prac­tices.</p>
    <p>Launch­ing the road map yes­ter­day, Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion Gan Siow Huang said the coro­n­avirus pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the adop­tion of dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies in the work­place, cre­at­ing a need for train­ing providers to adapt to on­line plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Over the next five years, the in­sti­tute will con­tinue pro­vid­ing av­enues for ed­u­ca­tors to learn and up­grade. This in­cludes tar­geted learn­ing for TAE prac­ti­tion­ers who are keen to keep their skills cur­rent, as well as for­mal learn­ing pro­grammes that lead to a de­gree or post-grad­u­ate qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>The IAL will also award badges to recog­nise the com­pe­ten­cies of in­dus­try prac­ti­tion­ers.</p>
    <p>“With a ro­bust plan laid out for the next five years, IAL is well-po­si­tioned to lead the trans­for­ma­tion of the TAE sec­tor to sup­port the next bound of Skill­sFu­ture,” Ms Gan said, not­ing that the vi­sion is for IAL to be the go-to au­thor­ity for the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The IAL’s iN.LAB, es­tab­lished five years ago to spur in­no­va­tion in adult learn­ing, also an­nounced a new part­ner­ship with key in­dus­try play­ers within the learn­ing in­no­va­tion com­mu­nity, in­clud­ing start-up in­cu­ba­tor Spaze.</p>
    <p>The net­work is in­tended to pro­vide sup­port to start-ups through men­tor­ship and in­tern­ship op­por­tu­ni­ties, and through ex­plor­ing com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion of pro­to­types.</p>
    <p>In the next five years, IAL also in­tends to bring the TAE com­mu­nity to­gether to more closely fos­ter learn­ing in­no­va­tion.</p>
    <p>IAL ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Lee Wing On said the next five years are very sig­nif­i­cant for the TAE sec­tor and Sin­ga­pore. “As a cham­pion of the TAE sec­tor, we stand at a crit­i­cal junc­ture to de­velop a sus­tain­able and com­pet­i­tive work­force, at a time when the par­a­digms of train­ing and learn­ing are mov­ing to­wards new in­no­va­tions and greater dig­i­tal pos­si­bil­i­ties.”</p>
