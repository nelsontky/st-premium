    <p>A hospi­tal has come up with new box shields that of­fer added pro­tec­tion for health­care work­ers per­form­ing high-risk aerosol-gen­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures on crit­i­cally ill pa­tients, in­clud­ing Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>One of the three box shields, which are called Bio-aerosol Con­tain­ment Units, will help pa­tients fac­ing life-threat­en­ing emer­gen­cies in the in­ten­sive care unit (ICU).</p>
    <p>A first re­spon­der us­ing it can im­me­di­ately per­form car­diopul­monary re­sus­ci­ta­tion on pa­tients, and pro­vide oxy­gen ther­apy for them. Pre­vi­ously, the per­son could give help in such a sit­u­a­tion only after putting on a bat­tery-pow­ered air pu­ri­fy­ing mask, a process that takes three to five min­utes.</p>
    <p>The other two shields en­able nonse­dated pa­tients to be propped up on the bed, pro­vid­ing more com­fort dur­ing their treat­ment in the ICU or when they are be­ing trans­ferred. This is an im­prove­ment on shields al­ready in the mar­ket, which are smaller and placed over pa­tients who re­cline flat on the bed.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing non-se­dated ICU pa­tients and those wak­ing up from surgery propped up is vi­tal for their com­fort and ease of breath­ing, said Ad­junct As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Deepak Joseph, senior con­sul­tant at Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal’s (NTFGH) de­part­ment of anaes­the­sia.</p>
    <p>“When pa­tients in the ICU have breath­ing dif­fi­cul­ties, they would want to nat­u­rally sit up be­cause when you are ly­ing down, your lung ca­pac­ity is less than when you are semi-re­clined,” he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Joseph is part of the eight­mem­ber med­i­cal team at NTFGH which de­signed the box shields in col­lab­o­ra­tion with Ngee Ann Polytech­nic’s Robotics Re­search and In­no­va­tion Cen­tre. The shield meant to be fit­ted to ICU beds is also de­tach­able – an in­no­va­tion that the med­i­cal team said makes it the first of its kind in the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan Chee Keat, head and senior con­sul­tant of in­ten­sive care medicine at NTFGH, who led the med­i­cal team, said the shields for trans­fer beds are im­por­tant be­cause pa­tients can spread in­fec­tions while be­ing wheeled from one fa­cil­ity to an­other.</p>
    <p>“Cur­rently, we have to de­ploy a se­cu­rity guard and clean­ers to dis­in­fect and mop the pa­tient’s path and cor­don off the area,” she said, adding that these steps can be skipped if in­fec­tious droplets are con­tained within the shield.</p>
    <p>The three shields, which cost be­tween $250 and $400 each, are large and spa­cious enough to pre­vent claus­tro­pho­bia and to con­tain in­tu­ba­tion items, said Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>One of three box shields cre­ated by Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal , it can be dis­man­tled and fit­ted onto</p>
    <p>ICU beds dur­ing high-risk aerosol-gen­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>A staff mem­ber of Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hospi­tal act­ing as a pa­tient to demon­strate how one of the box shields en­ables non-se­dated pa­tients to be propped up on bed, pro­vid­ing more com­fort, dur­ing treat­ment.</p>
