    <p>Bank­ing-re­lated phish­ing scams are not new but scam­mers have dis­cov­ered new hunt­ing grounds for vic­tims: mes­sag­ing apps and so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>New vari­ants of phish­ing scams in the dig­i­tal arena in­volve fake ad­ver­tis­ing cam­paigns and lucky draws al­legedly of­fered by banks, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>Vic­tims of such scams re­ceive a mes­sage via What­sApp al­legedly sent by a lo­cal bank.</p>
    <p>They may also be tricked by a fake ad­ver­tise­ment on Face­book, ask­ing them to take part in lucky draws or cer­tain pro­mo­tions to win at­trac­tive prizes.</p>
    <p>Those who click on the URL link em­bed­ded in the text mes­sages or fake ad­ver­tise­ments are redi­rected to a fake bank web­site.</p>
    <p>The web­site then asks them to pro­vide their In­ter­net bank­ing de­tails and one-time pass­words.</p>
    <p>Most vic­tims re­alise they have been scammed only when they dis­cover that unau­tho­rised trans­ac­tions have been made from their bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The po­lice added that in or­der to tar­get cus­tomers from dif­fer­ent banks and pay­ment ser­vice providers, scam­mers may mod­ify these fake bank sites from time to time.</p>
    <p>Bank­ing-re­lated phish­ing scams had the fourth high­est num­ber of re­ported cases among all scam types in the first six months of this year, the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>From Jan­uary to June this year, 898 cases in­volv­ing such scams were re­ported, up from 34 in the same pe­riod last year – a more than 20-fold in­crease.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, vic­tims were cheated of $3.6 million in the first half of this year, up from $93,000 in the same pe­riod last year.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic are ad­vised to take mea­sures such as ver­i­fy­ing the au­then­tic­ity of the in­for­ma­tion they re­ceive by ac­cess­ing the of­fi­cial bank web­site.</p>
    <p>They should also re­frain from giv­ing out their per­sonal or bank ac­count de­tails and one-time pass­words to any­one.</p>
    <p>“Do not click on URL links in un­so­licited ad­ver­tise­ments and text mes­sages, espe­cially those re­lated to lucky draws or con­tests,” the po­lice said.</p>
    <p>Those who have ex­pe­ri­enced fraud­u­lent trans­ac­tions or fraud­u­lent credit or debit card charges should re­port them to their banks and can­cel their cards im­me­di­ately.</p>
    <p>For scam-re­lated ad­vice, the pub­lic can call the anti-scam helpline on 1800-722-6688 or go to www.sca­malert.sg</p>
    <p>Those who wish to pro­vide in­for­ma­tion on scams may call the po­lice on 1800-255-0000 or go to www.po­lice.gov.sg/iwit­ness</p>
