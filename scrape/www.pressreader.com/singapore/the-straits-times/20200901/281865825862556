    <p>MEL­BOURNE • The coro­n­avirus lock­down in Aus­tralia’s Vic­to­ria state caused an im­me­di­ate slump in con­sumer spend­ing and a surge in job losses last month, prompt­ing the fed­eral govern­ment to call for the leader of the sec­ond-most pop­u­lous state to an­nounce a plan to re­open the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“This has to be the big­gest pub­lic pol­icy fail­ure by a state govern­ment in liv­ing mem­ory,” Trea­surer Josh Fry­den­berg told re­porters in Can­berra yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria Premier Daniel An­drews later an­nounced that he in­tended to pro­vide a “de­tailed road map” out of the lock­down on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of Vic­to­ri­ans re­ceiv­ing un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits has risen by 27,600 since June 26, a 7.2 per cent in­crease, and more than half of that to­tal was recorded in the three weeks ended Aug 21, ac­cord­ing to the fed­eral Trea­sury. The state im­posed se­vere re­stric­tions on Aug 2 as the pace of Covid-19 in­fec­tions climbed.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son’s govern­ment is con­cerned that the lock­down in the state, which ac­counts for about 25 per cent of the na­tion’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, will ex­ac­er­bate stresses on an econ­omy that has tipped into its first re­ces­sion in al­most three decades.</p>
    <p>Mr Fry­den­berg, who is craft­ing a bud­get to be de­liv­ered on Oct 6, is lead­ing calls for Mr An­drews to an­nounce a plan to quickly al­low busi­nesses to re­open as re­stric­tions bring the pan­demic un­der con­trol.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria had 73 new virus cases yes­ter­day, the low­est since July 3. But its death toll rose by a record 41, in­clud­ing 22 fa­tal­i­ties which came from aged care fa­cil­i­ties in the weeks lead­ing up to Aug 27. Aus­tralia’s pre­vi­ous one-day high for Covid-19 deaths was recorded on Aug 25, when 25 peo­ple died.</p>
    <p>“We now need the Vic­to­rian govern­ment to pro­vide more de­tailed an­swers and a more de­tailed road map” out of the lock­down, Mr Fry­den­berg said in a ra­dio in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“Out­side of Vic­to­ria, jobs have come back and the virus has been con­trolled.”</p>
    <p>The resur­gence of the coro­n­avirus in Vic­to­ria has prompted lead­ers of other states and ter­ri­to­ries to en­force hard bor­der re­stric­tions for the first time since the</p>
    <p>Span­ish flu pan­demic a cen­tury ago. That is play­ing havoc on busi­nesses in­volved in trans­port, tourism and other sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Premier An­drews said yes­ter­day that his govern­ment will this week col­late more data and con­sult with busi­nesses, unions and community groups be­fore an­nounc­ing his plan to ease virus-linked re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“There will be a num­ber of key prin­ci­ples that un­der­pin this open­ing- up road map in­clud­ing phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing, mak­ing sure staff work from home wher­ever pos­si­ble and lim­it­ing the to­tal num­ber of staff and cus­tomers in any en­closed area and stop­ping car pool­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures also likely to be en­forced in­clude wear­ing a face cov­er­ing at all times in the work­place and mak­ing sure pro­tec­tive equip­ment is used in higher risk in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has recorded nearly 26,000 Covid-19 in­fec­tions and 652 fa­tal­i­ties from the virus – far fewer than other de­vel­oped coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­rian house­hold spend­ing is now down 30 per cent year-to­date, from flat in mid-July, even as Aus­tralia-wide it has de­clined 3 per cent.</p>
