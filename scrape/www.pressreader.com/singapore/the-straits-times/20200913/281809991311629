    <p>LA­HORE • A Pak­istani po­lice chief is fac­ing a grow­ing back­lash af­ter he seemed to blame the vic­tim in a gang rape case be­cause she was driv­ing at night with­out a male com­pan­ion.</p>
    <p>The con­tro­versy started af­ter a wo­man said she was as­saulted and raped by mul­ti­ple men in front of her two chil­dren when her car ran out of fuel near the east­ern city of La­hore late on Wednesday.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to me­dia, La­hore po­lice chief Umar Sheikh re­peat­edly chided the vic­tim for driv­ing at night with­out a man, adding that no one in Pak­istani so­ci­ety would “al­low their sis­ters and daugh­ters to travel alone so late”.</p>
    <p>Mr Sheikh went on to say the wo­man – a res­i­dent of France – prob­a­bly “mis­took that Pak­istani so­ci­ety is just as safe” as her home coun­try.</p>
    <p>Hu­man rights min­is­ter Shireen Mazari said his re­marks were un­ac­cept­able, adding: “Noth­ing can ever ra­tio­nalise the crime of rape.”</p>
    <p>Protests were held in cities across Pak­istan on Fri­day, and Mr Sheikh’s com­ments sparked de­mands for his res­ig­na­tion.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want him in of­fice,” pro­tester Sha­heena Khan said at a rally in Is­lam­abad. “We want se­cu­rity from the po­lice and the gov­ern­ment. It is their job”.</p>
    <p>Lawyer and wo­man’s rights activist Khadija Sid­diqi told AFP that Mr Sheikh’s com­ments were part of an un­for­tu­nate and “very ram­pant” cul­ture of vic­tim-blam­ing in Pak­istan.</p>
    <p>Much of con­ser­va­tive Pak­istan lives un­der a pa­tri­ar­chal code of “hon­our” that sys­tem­a­tises the op­pres­sion of women by pre­vent­ing them from, for ex­am­ple, choos­ing their own hus­band or work­ing out­side the home.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists have de­nounced per­va­sive, some­times deadly vi­o­lence by men – usu­ally male rel­a­tives – against women who break those taboos. Around 1,000 Pak­istani women are mur­dered in hon­our killings each year – in which the vic­tim, nor­mally a wo­man, is killed by a rel­a­tive for bring­ing shame on the fam­ily.</p>
