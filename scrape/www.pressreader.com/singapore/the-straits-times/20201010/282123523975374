    <p>Is salary trans­parency use­ful?</p>
    <p>Even if some­one is paid fairly for his ser­vices, there will al­ways be some (or per­haps many or most) who will in­sist on hav­ing equal or higher pay than an­other per­son who de­liv­ers more value.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers will be forced to deal with such squab­bles over pay, and there would likely be many res­ig­na­tions – not be­cause these em­ploy­ees were paid un­fairly, but be­cause they think they should be on equal foot­ing with those who de­liver more.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies and their HR de­part­ments will have a tough time re­tain­ing peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Amy Kok</p>
    <p>A per­son’s salary is con­fi­den­tial. If a boss pays a cer­tain em­ployee much more than oth­ers be­cause of his con­sci­en­tious per­for­mance, hon­esty and good be­hav­iour, so be it. If one wants to get more pay like him, do the same as him or be bet­ter than him.</p>
    <p>Mak­ing his pay pub­lic might cause jeal­ousy among the staff. John Tang</p>
    <p>Maybe pub­li­cise only the high­est and the low­est salaries in the com­pany for in­dus­trial bench­mark­ing to dis­cour­age over­pay­ing of ex­ec­u­tives and to en­cour­age higher min­i­mum wage.</p>
    <p>Pri­vate com­pa­nies have a right to keep it con­fi­den­tial un­less there are good, prac­ti­cal rea­sons for such dis­clo­sure, like pub­lic sub­si­dies or in­vest­ment rea­sons. Ni­cole Foo</p>
    <p>Yes, I think salary trans­parency is use­ful for peo­ple to know the amount of re­mu­ner­a­tion that dif­fer­ent jobs of­fer and the mar­ket rate, and bench­mark against these fig­ures. We can then make a rea­soned es­ti­mate of how much our ex­pected salary should be in an­other job. This can also help in terms of chart­ing ca­reer and salary pro­gres­sion in tan­dem.</p>
    <p>Kevin Tan</p>
    <p>Mak­ing the chief ex­ec­u­tive and top man­age­ment’s bonuses trans­par­ent will be bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Ng Teck Guan</p>
    <p>In any em­ploy­ment con­tract, the terms are stated. It is up to both par­ties to agree. No­body held a gun to ei­ther party’s head to sign it. In any case, if the em­ployee finds grounds for un­fair­ness, he can re­sign and get an al­ter­na­tive job.</p>
