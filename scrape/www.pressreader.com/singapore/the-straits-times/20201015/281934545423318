    <p>Ti­tled Har­mo­nious In­te­gra­tion, this photo of an ot­ter in the Bay East Gar­den won Mr Ong Yi Chao the first prize in the Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings Foun­da­tion’s in­au­gu­ral pho­tog­ra­phy con­test.</p>
    <p>The six-week con­test, which was launched on July 13 and ti­tled A Sus­tain­able Tomorrow, aimed to raise aware­ness of cli­mate change and en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues.</p>
    <p>It at­tracted more than 800 sub­mis­sions based on the theme of sus­tain­abil­ity, in­clud­ing pho­tos of green spa­ces, ur­ban farm­ing, bio­di­ver­sity, healthy liv­ing and home re­cy­cling ideas.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong, 35, is a graphic de­signer who has been pho­tograph­ing Sin­ga­pore’s wildlife and green spa­ces since he was 16 years old. He took many trips around Gar­dens by the Bay be­fore he man­aged to get this shot. He wanted to specif­i­cally cap­ture a pic­ture of an ot­ter be­cause they re­quire clean wa­ter to thrive.</p>
    <p>“If the ot­ters can do well, it’s a good sign of our abil­ity to co-ex­ist with na­ture,” he said in an in­ter­view with The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ever the crafts­man, Mr Ong said he is go­ing to put aside some of his prize money to up­grade his equip­ment.</p>
    <p>“Pho­tog­ra­phy is about pa­tience, and be­ing at the right place at the right time,” he added.</p>
