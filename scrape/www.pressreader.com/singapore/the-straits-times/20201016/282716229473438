    <p>Aries</p>
    <p>(March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Smile and nod – all you have to do is lis­ten. Your en­ergy is best spent help­ing or sup­port­ing oth­ers, but soon it will be their turn to help you.</p>
    <p>Taurus</p>
    <p>(April 20 - May 20) Recom­mit your­self to ex­er­cise. That could be as sim­ple as tak­ing more walks or as com­plex as start­ing a new daily reg­i­men at the gym.</p>
    <p>Gemini</p>
    <p>(May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Your cu­rios­ity is en­gaged and your big brain may lead you into un­charted ter­ri­tory. It is eas­ier than you would think to change your life.</p>
    <p>Cancer</p>
    <p>(June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>This is a bad time for new projects. You need to be to­tally se­cure in your cur­rent sit­u­a­tion be­fore adding jobs or go­ing out with new peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Leo</p>
    <p>(July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Some­one is help­ing you to see how great things can be – and you may be start­ing a new chap­ter. Let this per­son know how thank­ful you are.</p>
    <p>Virgo</p>
    <p>(Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>The small stuff is dis­tract­ing you from a real prob­lem. Mi­nor set­backs are a part of life, but some­thing un­usual is on its way.</p>
    <p>Libra</p>
    <p>(Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are flirt­ing with some­one who is amazed by the at­ten­tion. Your en­ergy scares and delights him or her. Who knows where this will lead?</p>
    <p>Scorpio</p>
    <p>(Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Take the easy so­lu­tion – com­plex­ity does not suit you right now. You can make se­ri­ous progress as long as you do not com­pli­cate mat­ters. Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) A le­gal is­sue gets be­tween you and your plans, but once you learn what is go­ing on, you should be able to make new plans quickly.</p>
    <p>Capricorn</p>
    <p>(Dec 22 - Jan 19) An un­con­ven­tional job op­por­tu­nity arises. You could take on new re­spon­si­bil­i­ties, change ca­reers or meet your per­fect busi­ness part­ner.</p>
    <p>Aquarius</p>
    <p>(Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>You are known for your brain­power. One hot idea from you can change things for­ever – and you have many. Speak to the right peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Pisces</p>
    <p>(Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You have to make a tough choice be­tween mul­ti­ple at­trac­tive op­tions and stick with it, which makes you a lit­tle ner­vous.</p>
