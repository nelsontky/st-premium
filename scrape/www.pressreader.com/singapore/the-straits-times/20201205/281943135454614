    <p>Ma­jor-Gen­eral Chen Wei of the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army in China knows what it means to don her uni­form.</p>
    <p>Whether it was fight­ing a dan­ger­ous vi­ral out­break, or con­tribut­ing to relief ef­forts in the 2008 Sichuan earth­quake and the 2014-16 Ebola out­break in West Africa, she has never shied away from duty.</p>
    <p>And so it was when Maj-Gen Chen, who was ed­u­cated at the pres­ti­gious Ts­inghua Univer­sity, ar­rived in Wuhan in late Jan­uary, on the third day af­ter the city had been sealed to con­tain a mys­te­ri­ous virus.</p>
    <p>It was the sec­ond day of Chi­nese New Year, and she had not even had time to tell her par­ents.</p>
    <p>She told state broad­caster CCTV in an in­ter­view: “The pan­demic is a mil­i­tary af­fair, and the af­fected ar­eas are the war zones.”</p>
    <p>Her work was com­mended by Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping at a cer­e­mony in Septem­ber to laud those who had con­trib­uted to China’s fight against the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In Wuhan, the chem­istry grad­u­ate worked from a makeshift lab­o­ra­tory, where she and a team of mil­i­tary sci­en­tists re­searched on treat­ment for pa­tients.</p>
    <p>They took the lead in de­vel­op­ing the plasma ther­apy that has since been ac­cepted as an of­fi­cially recog­nised treat­ment method, South China Morn­ing Post re­ported.</p>
    <p>Maj-Gen Chen, 54, who was given the ti­tle of Peo­ple’s Hero at the cer­e­mony, has also been lead­ing a team to work on a vac­cine with Chi­nese bio­phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm CanSino Bi­o­log­ics.</p>
    <p>Their can­di­date, Ad5-nCoV, was awarded the first Covid-19 vac­cine patent in China on Aug 11.</p>
    <p>In­ter­na­tional me­dia re­ported that Maj-Gen Chen was among the first to take the vac­cine, a claim that she had not ver­i­fied.</p>
    <p>Her ded­i­ca­tion to the cause has been praised by Chi­nese me­dia out­lets. She was also a top trend­ing topic on Weibo in February.</p>
    <p>Her fa­ther, who lives in their home town of Lanxi in east­ern Zhe­jiang province, found out his daugh­ter had been de­ployed to Wuhan only through the news.</p>
    <p>Her hus­band Ma Yim­ing, in the mean­time, took over the house­hold chores.</p>
    <p>He was a tech­ni­cian at a win­ery in 1989, when they first met on a train from Beijing to Qing­dao.</p>
    <p>He told CCTV how their then four-year-old son did not see his mother for months in 2003 when she and her team were in iso­la­tion de­vel­op­ing a nasal spray treat­ment for Sars.</p>
    <p>“My son jumped up and kissed the TV screen when he saw his mother on the news,” he said.</p>
    <p>Maj-Gen Chen was pre­sented na­tional hon­ours along­side tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine ex­pert Zhang Boli and Wuhan hospi­tal chief Zhang Dingyu at the Septem­ber cer­e­mony.</p>
