    <p>Sin­ga­pore was an early be­liever in In­dia’s im­mense po­ten­tial, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day at the launch of a book on Sin­ga­pore-In­dia re­la­tions, ti­tled In­dia On Our Minds. The 380-page book fea­tures 50 es­says by Sin­ga­pore­ans, in­clud­ing</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam.</p>
    <p>In the early 1990s, un­der the lead­er­ship of then Prime Min­is­ter P. V. Narasimha Rao, In­dia started to lib­er­alise and restruc­ture its econ­omy, un­shack­ling its growth.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore was an early be­liever in In­dia’s im­mense po­ten­tial, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day, not­ing that his pre­de­ces­sor Goh Chok Tong had sparked an “In­dia fever” back then.</p>
    <p>Emer­i­tus Se­nior Min­is­ter (ESM) Goh had urged Sin­ga­pore to trade more with and in­vest in In­dia.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic ties have deep­ened steadily since, with Sin­ga­pore’s in­vest­ments in In­dia in­creas­ing five­fold be­tween 1995 and 2000, said PM Lee, who made his first visit to the sub­con­ti­nent in 1992, when he was Deputy Prime Min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He made the point at the launch of a book on Sin­ga­pore-In­dia re­la­tions, ti­tled In­dia On Our Minds, at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) in Kent Ridge.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter noted the Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment (Ceca) was sub­se­quently signed, and a Strate­gic Part­ner­ship es­tab­lished in 2015, which co­in­cides with the 50th an­niver­sary of diplo­matic re­la­tions be­tween In­dia and Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The part­ner­ship re­flects the two coun­tries’ deep co­op­er­a­tion in de­fence, fi­nance, cul­ture and other ar­eas, he added.</p>
    <p>To­day, In­dia is a ma­jor player on the world stage, said PM Lee, wield­ing sig­nif­i­cant in­flu­ence at in­ter­na­tional fora.</p>
    <p>“De­bates on the ma­jor strate­gic is­sues of the day – cli­mate change, WTO (World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion) re­form, se­cu­rity in the Indo-Pa­cific – are not com­plete with­out In­dia at the ta­ble and play­ing a con­struc­tive role.”</p>
    <p>Like many other coun­tries, In­dia is suf­fer­ing the eco­nomic fall­out from Covid-19, but its long-term fu­ture re­mains bright and promis­ing, said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>And as Sin­ga­pore starts its term as co­or­di­na­tor of Asean-In­dia di­a­logue re­la­tions next year, it looks for­ward to deep­en­ing the part­ner­ship be­tween the re­gional bloc and New Delhi, he added.</p>
    <p>One move Sin­ga­pore hopes In­dia will take is to re­visit the mer­its of join­ing the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship, he said, re­fer­ring to the 15-coun­try trade pact signed last month.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther said that the book is a “timely re­minder that to Sin­ga­pore, In­dia will al­ways be a val­ued friend and part­ner”.</p>
    <p>“I know th­ese sen­ti­ments are re­cip­ro­cated by our In­dian friends, too. I look for­ward to work­ing with Prime Min­is­ter (Naren­dra) Modi and his gov­ern­ment to keep our re­la­tion­ship for­ward-look­ing, en­ter­pris­ing and sub­stan­tial.”</p>
    <p>The 380-page book fea­tures 50 es­says by Sin­ga­pore­ans, in­clud­ing Se­nior Min­is­ter Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam and pres­i­dent of YaleNUS Col­lege Tan Tai Yong.</p>
    <p>The book is edited by Am­bas­sador-At-Large Tommy Koh and the In­sti­tute of South Asian Stud­ies’ se­nior as­so­ciate di­rec­tor Her­naikh Singh.</p>
    <p>It re­tails at $28 in paper­back and $39 in hard­back with­out GST.</p>
    <p>In its fore­word, ESM Goh noted that the two coun­tries’ trad­ing and cul­tural links go back cen­turies.</p>
    <p>To­day, Sin­ga­pore’s ties with In­dia are strong, sub­stan­tive and broad-based, he wrote.</p>
    <p>“I ‘in­fected’ Sin­ga­pore with a ‘mild In­dia fever’. The fever did not be­come full blown but I never lost faith in In­dia,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that the coun­try can ex­er­cise a mod­er­at­ing in­flu­ence in the on­go­ing strate­gic ri­valry be­tween the US and China.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Koh said at the launch that the book has not shied away from sen­si­tive is­sues, like Ceca.</p>
    <p>“It would not be wrong to say the book con­tains 50 love let­ters to In­dia. I should, how­ever, i nform High Com­mis­sioner (to Sin­ga­pore Pe­ri­asamy) Ku­maran, that some of the let­ters are writ­ten by lov­ing crit­ics of In­dia,” he added.</p>
