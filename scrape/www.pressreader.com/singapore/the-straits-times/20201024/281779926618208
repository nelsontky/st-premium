    <p>A 28-year-old man was sen­tenced yes­ter­day to four weeks in prison for at­tempt­ing to bribe a po­lice of­fi­cer to avoid Covid-19 en­force­ment ac­tion.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als con­victed of a cor­rup­tion of­fence such as bribery can be fined up to $100,000 and im­pris­oned for up to five years.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese na­tional was spot­ted on May 7 by a pa­trol team from the Public Trans­port Se­cu­rity Com­mand with his mask down near the smok­ing cor­ner of Boon Lay MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>The four po­lice of­fi­cers ap­proached Chen Long and in­structed him to wear his mask prop­erly. He com­plied, but was spot­ted soon af­ter by the same pa­trol team with his mask pulled down to ex­pose his nose.</p>
    <p>Chen, who is on a work per­mit in Sin­ga­pore, was then taken to a room in the MRT sta­tion to be in­ter­viewed. Dur­ing the in­ter­view, Chen showed the money in his wal­let to po­lice of­fi­cer Chan Hui Shi and of­fered $50 to be let go.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cer re­fused his of­fer, and Chen was is­sued a com­po­si­tion fine of $300 for an of­fence un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent was later re­ported to the Cor­rupt Prac­tices In­ves­ti­ga­tion Bureau.</p>
    <p>Any­one caught not wear­ing a mask out­side the home faces a fine of $300 for a first of­fence and $1,000 for a se­cond of­fence.</p>
    <p>Any­one caught try­ing to bribe their way out of Covid-19 re­lated of­fences will face fur­ther pu­n­ish­ment un­der the law.</p>
