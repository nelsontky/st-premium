    <p>Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den has main­tained his wide lead na­tion­wide in opin­ion polls over Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, in­clud­ing in most bat­tle­ground states, with just two weeks to go be­fore the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Polls con­ducted by The Fi­nan­cial Times and The New York Times (NYT) also sug­gest that likely vot­ers are los­ing faith in the Pres­i­dent’s han­dling of the US econ­omy and the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fig­ures on polling data ag­gre­ga­tor RealClearP­ol­i­tics on Tues­day show Mr Trump trail­ing Mr Bi­den 42.5 per cent to 51.1 per cent. Both the NBC News/Wall Street Jour­nal and the Fox News Oc­to­ber polls show a sim­i­lar trend, with the Pres­i­dent trail­ing Mr Bi­den 42 per cent to 53 per cent and 43 per cent to 53 per cent, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>A Reuters/Ip­sos sur­vey pub­lished on Oct 14 found Mr Bi­den to be lead­ing Mr Trump by 10 per­cent­age points. And 51 per cent of sam­pled vot­ers in an Oct 11-13 poll by The Economist magazine and Bri­tain-based YouGov favoured Mr Bi­den over Mr Trump who got 41 per cent. The NYT/Siena Col­lege poll pub­lished on Tues­day showed Mr Bi­den hold­ing a nine-point lead over Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>Statis­tics in the bat­tle­ground states are par­tic­u­larly wor­ry­ing for Mr Trump, who pre­vailed in many of them in 2016. And in those where he did not, his Demo­cratic op­po­nent then, Mrs Hil­lary Clin­ton, won by only a nar­row mar­gin. Of the 14 bat­tle­ground states, 10 voted for Mr Trump in 2016. But re­cent polls sug­gest that he is ahead in only two, Texas and Ohio, and Mr Trump is only marginally ahead in the lat­ter. States like Iowa and Ge­or­gia, where Mr Trump won by 6-9 per­cent­age points over his op­po­nent in 2016, are now lean­ing to­wards Mr Bi­den, ac­cord­ing to RealClearP­ol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>In Michi­gan and Wis­con­sin, which voted for Mr Trump in 2016, likely vot­ers are sway­ing to­wards Mr Bi­den by 6-7 per­cent­age points.</p>
    <p>Data on RealClearP­ol­i­tics has shown Mr Bi­den to be ahead of Mr Trump in most na­tional polls since early this year, with up to a 10-point lead on some oc­ca­sions. Covid-19 and the econ­omy seem to be the two most im­por­tant is­sues and, in what spells trou­ble for Mr Trump, many vot­ers seem to be los­ing faith in his han­dling of the two is­sues.</p>
    <p>A monthly sur­vey by The Fi­nan­cial Times/Peter G. Peter­son Foun­da­tion this month found that 46 per cent of Amer­i­cans be­lieve Mr Trump’s poli­cies are hurt­ing the econ­omy, com­pared with 44 per cent who think they have helped. It was the first time this year that a larger share of re­spon­dents said the Pres­i­dent’s eco­nomic poli­cies had hurt rather than helped.</p>
    <p>The Oc­to­ber poll also sug­gested that only a third of Amer­i­cans thought they were fi­nan­cially bet­ter off com­pared with four years ago when Mr Trump took of­fice.</p>
    <p>More than half of the re­spon­dents in the NYT/Siena Col­lege poll, done be­tween Oct 15 and 18, said the coun­try as a whole was do­ing worse than in 2016. The re­spon­dents were evenly split on whether they had more trust in Mr Trump or Mr Bi­den to man­age the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>On the Covid-19 pan­demic, only one in five Amer­i­cans was con­fi­dent the sit­u­a­tion would im­prove in their com­mu­nity within the next month, ac­cord­ing to the FT/ Peter­son sur­vey. Sim­i­larly, the NYT/Siena poll showed a ma­jor­ity of vot­ers thought the worst is yet to come and just 37 per cent of those sam­pled be­lieved oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den is favoured over Mr Trump to lead on the pan­demic by 12 points, ac­cord­ing to the NYT/Siena sur­vey. In the same sur­vey, the ma­jor­ity of re­spon­dents sup­ported manda­tory mask-wear­ing, 59 per cent to 39 per cent over­all, with more than two-thirds of vot­ers above 65 back­ing such a man­date. But only 32 per cent of re­spon­dents sup­ported manda­tory vac­ci­na­tion af­ter a vac­cine was ap­proved by the Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion. Al­most two-thirds op­posed such a re­quire­ment.</p>
    <p>The same NYT/Siena poll also showed seven in 10 vot­ers, more than half of whom were Repub­li­cans, favour­ing a new multi-tril­lion-dol­lar stim­u­lus pro­gramme that in­cludes gov­ern­ment sup­port for Amer­i­cans and emer­gency help at state and district lev­els. More than two-thirds of those sam­pled in the sur­vey sup­ported the US$2 tril­lion (S$2.7 tril­lion) re­new­able en­ergy and in­fra­struc­ture pack­age that Mr Bi­den has pro­posed as a form of eco­nomic stim­u­lus.</p>
    <p>But it is not all dis­mal news for Mr Trump; he is ahead in some seg­ments, most no­tably among white vot­ers with­out col­lege de­grees. In gen­eral, a ma­jor­ity of white vot­ers and male Amer­i­cans pre­ferred Mr Trump over Mr Bi­den, while about two-thirds of non-white Amer­i­cans favoured Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Among women, mi­nori­ties and ed­u­cated whites, Mr Bi­den is the pre­ferred can­di­date. The NYT/Siena poll showed Mr Bi­den ahead of Mr Trump among fe­male vot­ers by 23 points, or 58 per cent to 35 per cent. In 2016, Mrs Clin­ton was only ahead of Mr Trump among white women, 52 per cent to 43 per cent.</p>
    <p>Things may be look­ing up for Mr Bi­den at the mo­ment but, based on his­tor­i­cal trends, the opin­ion polls are by no means an ac­cu­rate in­di­ca­tor of the fi­nal re­sult.</p>
    <p>In 2016, Mrs Clin­ton led in the polls up to elec­tion day and even­tu­ally got nearly three million more votes than Mr Trump, but still lost the elec­tion be­cause Mr Trump won the stakes in the all-im­por­tant elec­toral col­lege which is de­cided on a state-by-state ba­sis.</p>
