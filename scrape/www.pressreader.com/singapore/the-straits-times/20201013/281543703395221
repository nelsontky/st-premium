    <p>The “hid­den” cost of en­vi­ron­men­tal pol­lu­tion is huge and may rise if safe­guards are re­moved in the in­ter­ests of boost­ing a pan­demic-stricken econ­omy, says China bureau chief Tan Dawn Wei (be­low).</p>
    <p>Qingxia, a vil­lage of 1,500 in the in­dus­trial city of Zhuzhou in Hu­nan province, has the ig­nominy of be­ing one of hun­dreds of “cancer vil­lages” in China.</p>
    <p>As much as 10 per cent of its pop­u­la­tion suf­fer from cancer, a star­tling num­ber when put against the na­tional av­er­age of 1 per cent.</p>
    <p>As in­dus­trial plants dumped all man­ner of harm­ful chem­i­cals into rivers or pro­duced large amounts of pol­lu­tants within the fa­cil­i­ties them­selves, peo­ple who lived near them or worked in the fac­to­ries fell sick. Chi­nese me­dia be­gan iden­ti­fy­ing these cancer vil­lages as early as 1998, but the gov­ern­ment did not ac­knowl­edge them un­til seven years ago.</p>
    <p>Be­tween the years of 2000 and 2009, as many as 186 such vil­lages were iden­ti­fied, making up half of all cancer vil­lages. There could be more, since pol­lu­tants in the body take an av­er­age of two decades to turn can­cer­ous.</p>
    <p>These cancer vil­lages epit­o­mise the dev­as­ta­tion that na­tion­wide pol­lu­tion has wreaked on peo­ple’s health in China, says global health ex­pert Huang Yanzhong, a cri­sis that could be mod­ern China’s Achilles heel.</p>
    <p>THE COSTS</p>
    <p>In his new book, Toxic Pol­i­tics: China’s En­vi­ron­men­tal Health</p>
    <p>Cri­sis And Its Chal­lenge To The Chi­nese State, Dr Huang, a se­nior fel­low for global health at the Coun­cil on For­eign Re­la­tions in New York City, ar­gues that air, water and soil pol­lu­tion not only af­flict the Chi­nese with more dis­eases and health prob­lems than pre­vi­ously thought, but they are also ex­act­ing a sig­nif­i­cant toll on the coun­try’s econ­omy and polity while crimp­ing its as­cen­dance in the world.</p>
    <p>“If you look at the dam­age as­so­ci­ated with en­vi­ron­men­tal pol­lu­tion, it was es­ti­mated to have cost up to 18 per cent of China’s GDP (gross do­mes­tic prod­uct) in 2013. So, whether you like it or not, you can’t deny the eco­nomic cost of pol­lu­tion. And if you look at its so­ciopo­lit­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions, the stakes be­come even higher,” Dr Huang tells The Straits Times in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>China’s abil­ity to project its power in­ter­na­tion­ally is also con­strained by its en­vi­ron­men­tal cri­sis at home; the ob­sta­cles to over­com­ing it are much more daunt­ing than any­where else.</p>
    <p>“The United States, be­fore it be­came a su­per­power, did not ex­pe­ri­ence an en­vi­ron­men­tal cri­sis like China’s. Also, in­dus­tri­alised coun­tries’ ini­tial en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues were more lo­calised, whereas in China, it is a ubiq­ui­tous prob­lem,” says Dr Huang.</p>
    <p>As many as 80 per cent of Chi­nese cit­i­zens are reg­u­larly ex­posed to pol­lu­tion lev­els much higher than those con­sid­ered safe by the US En­vi­ron­men­tal Pro­tec­tion Agency, Amer­ica-based non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Berke­ley Earth found in 2015.</p>
    <p>Last year, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO) listed air pol­lu­tion as the No. 1 threat to global health. It is said to kill seven mil­lion peo­ple world­wide each year, more than Aids, malaria, breast cancer or tu­ber­cu­lo­sis.</p>
    <p>In a study pub­lished in Au­gust in the sci­en­tific jour­nal Pro­ceed­ings of the Na­tional Academy of Sciences, Chi­nese re­searchers said they found ev­i­dence that as many as 30.8 mil­lion peo­ple could have died pre­ma­turely in China be­tween 2000 and 2016 from breath­ing in pol­luted air.</p>
    <p>Var­i­ous re­cent stud­ies have also linked air pol­lu­tion in China with a host of other health prob­lems, in­clud­ing the risk of mis­car­riage, stroke, heart dis­ease, lung cancer and Covid-19 mor­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>While both do­mes­tic and in­ter­na­tional at­ten­tion has largely been on bad air, water and soil con­tam­i­na­tion – which has un­til re­cent years been un­der the radar – is wreak­ing as much havoc on peo­ple’s lives.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties re­leased in 2014 its first na­tion­wide soil sur­vey, which showed that 16 per cent of the coun­try’s soil was con­tam­i­nated, in­clud­ing nearly 20 per cent of farm­land, which was found to be laced with heavy me­tals such as cad­mium.</p>
    <p>The sit­u­a­tion was so grim over “cad­mium rice” that state me­dia be­gan ad­vis­ing peo­ple to diver­sify their diet. It wasn’t un­til 2018 that the coun­try passed its first com­pre­hen­sive soil pol­lu­tion pre­ven­tion and con­trol law.</p>
    <p>And, even as there are mas­sive ef­forts to clean up China’s wa­ter­ways, about 7 per cent of its water is still un­fit for use in ei­ther agri­cul­ture or in­dus­try, said the En­vi­ron­ment Min­istry in 2018.</p>
    <p>“While China’s war on pol­lu­tion has achieved sig­nif­i­cant gains, the progress has been un­even, and even ac­com­pa­nied by un­in­tended or un­de­sir­able con­se­quences,” says Dr Huang, who is also a pro­fes­sor and the di­rec­tor of global health stud­ies at Se­ton Hall Univer­sity’s School of Diplo­macy and In­ter­na­tional Re­la­tions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, as the au­thor­i­ties rapidly ex­panded coal gasi­fi­ca­tion in a bid to curb air pol­lu­tion from burn­ing dirty coal, this in­ad­ver­tently ex­ac­er­bated the coun­try’s water short­age prob­lem, since the process of turn­ing coal to gas is highly water-in­ten­sive.</p>
    <p>AC­TION PLANS</p>
    <p>In the 1970s, en­vi­ron­men­tal pol­lu­tion was thought of by</p>
    <p>Chi­nese lead­ers as be­ing en­demic in what was seen as the “deca­dent, cap­i­tal­ist West”.</p>
    <p>As the coun­try de­vel­oped its econ­omy at a break­neck pace, it con­soled it­self that it was go­ing down the same road of “pol­lu­tion first and pro­tec­tion later”, says Dr Huang.</p>
    <p>“This model is not con­sid­ered one that should be em­u­lated or copied by other coun­tries. So when China pushes to ex­port its de­vel­op­ment model, I don’t think it will be ef­fec­tive be­cause the model should not be con­sid­ered best prac­tice for gov­ern­ing en­vi­ron­men­tal health or other de­vel­op­ment is­sues.”</p>
    <p>The quest for eco­nomic growth has come at the great ex­pense of China’s en­vi­ron­ment and the health of its peo­ple. Yet the gov­ern­ment has been suc­cess­ful in man­ag­ing peo­ple’s ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>In Jan­uary 2013, just as the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment be­gan making pub­lic the air qual­ity in­dex (AQI) that mea­sures fine par­tic­u­late mat­ter, PM2.5, for cities across the coun­try, cap­i­tal city Bei­jing faced an “air­poca­lypse” when AQI read­ings hit nearly 1,000 one day. A read­ing of over 300 is al­ready con­sid­ered “haz­ardous” and could trig­ger the au­thor­i­ties to take emer­gency ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Hos­pi­tals swelled with peo­ple suf­fer­ing from smog-filled lungs, while schools, roads and air­ports were shut. The record lev­els of pol­lu­tion led to an out­pour­ing of anger, fi­nally in­duc­ing the gov­ern­ment to take ac­tion. It re­leased the first Air Pol­lu­tion Ac­tion Plan in Septem­ber that year, set­ting out tar­gets to im­prove air qual­ity by re­duc­ing PM2.5 lev­els.</p>
    <p>Coal-fired power plants around the cap­i­tal city were shut and the num­ber of cars re­stricted on the roads. The gov­ern­ment also em­barked on re­for­esta­tion pro­grammes, plant­ing bil­lions of trees across a dozen prov­inces.</p>
    <p>Since then, PM2.5 lev­els have plunged by as much as 40 per cent, al­though ground-level ozone – a key fo­cus in a 2017 up­dated ac­tion plan – spiked as the de­crease in PM2.5 sped up ozone pro­duc­tion, ac­cord­ing to a Har­vard Univer­sity study pub­lished early last year.</p>
    <p>Still, with more vis­i­ble blue-sky days and a con­certed pro­pa­ganda ef­fort to high­light its achieve­ments, Bei­jing has suc­cess­fully con­trolled the nar­ra­tive – and pub­lic opin­ion – on its war on pol­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>“But that doesn’t mean that pol­lu­tion has dis­ap­peared as a prob­lem. Cer­tainly, the sit­u­a­tion over­all is get­ting bet­ter, but if you ap­ply the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s stan­dard, it is still much worse than many of the in­dus­tri­alised coun­tries’,” says Dr Huang.</p>
    <p>A WHO re­port showed that in 2016, the an­nual me­dian ex­po­sure to am­bi­ent PM2.5 in China was 48.8μg/m3, nearly five times higher than the global health body’s rec­om­men­da­tion.</p>
    <p>ECO­NOMIC RE­COV­ERY</p>
    <p>With lo­cal of­fi­cials now bent on re­coup­ing the eco­nomic losses suf­fered due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and a bleak global out­look, China’s en­vi­ron­men­tal health and the tar­gets it has set are at risk.</p>
    <p>As the re­gional au­thor­i­ties ac­cel­er­ate eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity in their patch, highly pol­lut­ing coal and steel pro­duc­tion is in­creas­ing.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has al­ready com­mit­ted to ramp­ing up in­fra­struc­ture build­ing across the coun­try to pull it out of the dol­drums, push­ing up the de­mand for steel. It has also ap­proved plans for new coal power plant ca­pac­ity at a record rate since 2015, de­spite an ef­fort to re­duce its de­pen­dence on this dirty en­ergy source. More than half the coun­try’s en­ergy mix still comes from coal, of which China is the top pro­ducer and con­sumer.</p>
    <p>Dr Huang blames China’s en­vi­ron­men­tal co­nun­drum on a flawed po­lit­i­cal sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“The prob­lem is with pol­icy im­ple­men­ta­tion, which con­tin­ues to heav­ily rely on mo­bil­i­sa­tion cam­paigns,” says Dr Huang, who in 2012 au­thored Gov­ern­ing Health In Con­tem­po­rary China, a book on the po­lit­i­cal and pol­icy dy­nam­ics of health gov­er­nance in post-Mao China.</p>
    <p>“The gov­ern­ment sets out the ob­jec­tives, it mo­bilises the bu­reau­cracy and so­ci­ety to achieve that ob­jec­tive. That is good for hit­ting short-term pol­icy ob­jec­tives, but won’t be sus­tain­able in the long run,” he says, point­ing to the cur­rent uptick in coal and steel pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>“The root cause of the prob­lem is per­for­mance-based le­git­i­macy.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party has to con­tinue to de­liver goods and ser­vices to the Chi­nese peo­ple at a time when the gap be­tween peo­ple’s ex­pec­ta­tions and the ca­pac­ity to de­liver them is widen­ing.”</p>
    <p>Hence, there is an ur­gency to pro­mote eco­nomic growth and sta­bilise em­ploy­ment, which have strong im­pli­ca­tions for the coun­try’s so­ciopo­lit­i­cal sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is com­pounded by “band­wagon pol­i­tics”, with power cen­tralised un­der Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping, com­pelling lower-level of­fi­cials “to act more Catholic than the Pope” as they over­shoot in im­ple­ment­ing poli­cies, says Dr Huang.</p>
    <p>He cited the ex­am­ple of house­holds in north­ern He­bei province that were left freez­ing with­out heat in the dead of win­ter in 2017, amid a gas short­age and a ban on coal as the au­thor­i­ties rushed to sub­sti­tute nat­u­ral gas for coal.</p>
    <p>CAR­BON NEU­TRAL­ITY</p>
    <p>Last month, Mr Xi made a bold prom­ise that his coun­try – the world’s big­gest pol­luter – would be car­bon neu­tral by 2060.</p>
    <p>It’s an im­pres­sive pledge, no doubt. “I think it’s one thing to make this of­fi­cial state­ment, but it is an­other to trans­late rhetoric into pol­icy re­al­ity,” says Dr Huang.</p>
    <p>If China doesn’t change its pol­icy im­ple­men­ta­tion model, Dr Huang says he is not con­fi­dent car­bon neu­tral­ity can hap­pen in 40 years.</p>
    <p>Achiev­ing this daunt­ing goal will re­quire rev­o­lu­tion­is­ing its econ­omy and dra­mat­i­cally trans­form­ing its en­ergy mix, ex­perts have pointed out. It would mean for­go­ing coal for elec­tric­ity and sig­nif­i­cantly boost­ing nu­clear and re­new­able power gen­er­a­tion. Coal still ac­counts for 58 per cent of the coun­try’s to­tal en­ergy con­sump­tion, and 66 per cent of its elec­tric­ity gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, China’s en­vi­ron­men­tal cri­sis is mul­ti­fac­eted and com­pli­cated and would re­quire a multi-sec­toral ap­proach in­volv­ing co­or­di­na­tion among var­i­ous gov­ern­ment en­ti­ties and pub­lic par­tic­i­pa­tion, all work­ing to achieve com­mon goals, rather than its usual top-down ap­proach.</p>
    <p>“It hinges on an up­date of China’s tool­box in pub­lic pol­icy process, to ac­com­mo­date more so­cial forces such as NGOs (non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions), mar­ket forces and the rule of law,” says Dr Huang.</p>
    <p>Toxic Pol­i­tics: China’s En­vi­ron­men­tal Health Cri­sis And Its Chal­lenge To The Chi­nese State will be re­leased on Thurs­day.</p>
