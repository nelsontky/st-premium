    <p>Barely a week after it an­nounced a sen­sa­tional bid for English Premier League club New­cas­tle United, ques­tions have sur­faced about the Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered Bel­la­graph Nova Group (BN Group) be­hind the bid.</p>
    <p>This comes after it ad­mit­ted to doc­tor­ing pho­to­graphs of former United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama in its public­ity ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>BN Group spokesman Nereides An­to­nio Giamundo de Bour­bon was re­ported by Reuters yes­ter­day as say­ing that the com­pany had al­tered photos of Mr Obama to make them look as though he had at­tended a meet­ing with its ex­ec­u­tives in Paris.</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, the photos of Mr Obama and BN Group co-founders were taken at a char­ity gala event in Sin­ga­pore last De­cem­ber spon­sored by Novena Global Life­care, which was founded in 2010 by Sin­ga­pore busi­ness­men Ter­ence Loh, 42, and Nel­son Loh, 41, who are cousins.</p>
    <p>The BN Group was co-founded by the two men, who are lo­cal en­trepreneur­s and former JP Mor­gan in­vest­ment bankers, and Ms Evan­ge­line Shen, a Chi­nese jew­ellery mer­chant and former Mor­gan Stan­ley banker.</p>
    <p>Reuters also said that while BN Group said it is head­quar­tered in Paris, it found that no com­pany called Bel­la­graph Nova Group is reg­is­tered in France. Reuters also did not find the com­pany at the Paris ad­dress that was listed – 10 Place Ven­dome.</p>
    <p>Mr de Bour­bon told Reuters: “We are se­ri­ous peo­ple... the only am­bigu­ous thing has been the pho­to­shop pic­ture. There wasn’t any ma­li­cious aim be­hind it.”</p>
    <p>Other in­con­sis­ten­cies re­ported by Reuters:</p>
    <p>• The group said that fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy firm Hy­dra X is one of the en­ti­ties in its global em­pire and that it is im­ple­ment­ing a trad­ing sys­tem for the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change. Reuters said the firm has de­nied both claims and the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change has also de­nied Hy­dra X is im­ple­ment­ing a trad­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>But Mr de Bour­bon told Reuters that Hy­dra X was owned by BN Group and was in the process of merg­ing into the group. He said: “Some­times the mar­ket­ing moves faster than the process.”</p>
    <p>• BN Group said another en­tity, a ro­bot­ics firm called NETX, is listed on the SGX and New York’s Nas­daq ex­change but Reuters said it could find no records of the com­pany on ei­ther ex­change.</p>
    <p>Last night, Mr de Bour­bon, who is BN Group’s chief mar­ket­ing and in­vestor re­la­tions of­fi­cer, told The Sunday Times that the group “has re­cently ac­quired a stake in Ax­ing­ton Inc, a com­pany listed on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change”.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton is to hold an ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ing on Thurs­day, where “a pro­posal will be con­sid­ered to change the name of Ax­ing­ton Inc to Netx Inc”.</p>
    <p>He added: “What was dis­cussed with Reuters did not ac­cu­rately and fully con­vey the trans­ac­tion covered in the ar­ti­cle...</p>
    <p>“The im­pres­sion cre­ated by the Reuters ar­ti­cle that the Group has been some­what less than forth­right on this is­sue is com­pletely false.”</p>
    <p>He also said that BN Group is “in com­mu­ni­ca­tions with the Obama Foun­da­tion to ad­dress the neg­a­tive light that has been cast upon them as a re­sult of the ar­ti­cle”. The pho­to­shopped pho­to­graphs of Mr Obama have be­come one of sev­eral talking points about the BN Group since it an­nounced on Aug 15 that it was “at an ad­vanced stage of ne­go­ti­a­tion” for a takeover of New­cas­tle, hav­ing al­ready pro­vided a let­ter of in­tent and proof of funds.</p>
    <p>New­cas­tle and its owner Mike Ash­ley, have not re­sponded to re­quests for com­ment but Bri­tish tabloids have re­ported that Mr Ash­ley has not re­sponded to BN Group’s re­ported £280 mil­lion (S$503 mil­lion) of­fer, with the Lon­don busi­ness­man seek­ing an of­fer closer to £350 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>A source with knowl­edge and ex­pe­ri­ence of takeovers in Euro­pean foot­ball told ST: “As a seller, Mike Ash­ley won’t say any­thing be­cause news like this can help him cre­ate com­pet­i­tive ten­sion.”</p>
    <p>While the BN Group had also said that former New­cas­tle play­ers Michael Cho­pra and Alan Shearer were back­ing its bid, Reuters re­ported that former Eng­land cap­tain Shearer’s man­age­ment com­pany de­nied he was in­volved in the takeover.</p>
    <p>BN Group has said it owns 31 busi­ness en­ti­ties, had a turnover of US$12 billion (S$16.5 billion) last year, and has 23,000 em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>While the Lohs’ bid for New­cas­tle came as a sur­prise, the cousins do have some ties to the lo­cal sports fra­ter­nity, back­ing lo­cal pro­fes­sional race driver Yuey Tan, the na­tional Muay Thai team, and the St Michael’s Soc­cer As­so­ci­a­tion. BN Group also owns Dorr Group Rac­ing Team, who have raced in the Porsche Car­rera Cup Asia and Porsche Mo­bil 1 Su­per­cup since 2012.</p>
    <p>One former busi­ness part­ner of the Lohs, who de­clined to be named, said: “They are very so­cial peo­ple, and come across as very well-bred and went to good uni­ver­si­ties.”</p>
    <p>Another source, who also de­clined to be named but de­scribed him­self as a pro­fes­sional peer, said: “They were ag­gres­sive busi­ness­men, mar­keted hard, and they de­serve credit for that.”</p>
    <p>But he ques­tioned some of their claims: “You don’t go around say­ing Obama met you in Paris, that you have 10,000 jets and things like that.”</p>
    <p>The claim that the BN Group op­er­ated over 10,000 pri­vate jets – ac­cord­ing to the group, a “world record num­ber of pri­vate jets for a sin­gle en­tity” – was posted on its In­sta­gram ac­count, but the post was later edited to re­move men­tion of the 10,000 fig­ure.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines, in com­par­i­son, has 138 air­craft in its fleet, while Amer­i­can Air­lines, the largest com­mer­cial air­line in the world, has 874 reg­is­tered air­craft.</p>
    <p>The Sunday Times has asked Harry Walker Agency, which man­ages Mr Obama’s speak­ing en­gage­ments, for com­ment.</p>
    <p>NOT AC­CU­RATE</p>
    <p>What was dis­cussed with Reuters did not ac­cu­rately and fully con­vey the trans­ac­tion covered in the ar­ti­cle... The im­pres­sion cre­ated by the Reuters ar­ti­cle that the Group has been some­what less than forth­right on this is­sue is com­pletely false.</p>
