    <p>LON­DON • Liver­pool are un­beaten in their l ast 61 home Pre­mier League matches but man­ager Jurgen Klopp is aware of the chal­lenge posed by Sh­effield United to­day.</p>
    <p>The Pre­mier League cham­pi­ons are clos­ing in on a club record of 63 home league wins from 1978-81. The last time they were beaten at An­field in the top flight was when they went down 2-1 to Crys­tal Palace in April 2017.</p>
    <p>Chris Wilder’s side were last sea­son’s sur­prise pack­age af­ter they fin­ished ninth on their first sea­son back af­ter a 12-year ab­sence, but they ap­pear to be suf­fer­ing from a case of the se­cond-sea­son syn­drome.</p>
    <p>The Blades are win­less and 19th af­ter five games of the new cam­paign, but Klopp be­lieves the vis­i­tors are bet­ter than their cur­rent po­si­tion sug­gests.</p>
    <p>“(Sh­effield United) de­serve a lot of at­ten­tion for what they do be­cause it is re­ally good,” the Reds man­ager said at his vir­tual pre­match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Even when the re­sults are not so far like they wished for the per­for­mances, they have not been bad and I’m sure Chris Wilder knows that. For us, that makes it tricky and they had a full week to pre­pare for this game.”</p>
    <p>With in­juries to sev­eral first­team play­ers and a lack of scor­ing op­tions, United started with four straight de­feats but showed sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ment in last Sun­day’s 1-1 draw with pro­moted Ful­ham.</p>
    <p>In the ab­sence of the in­jured Vir­gil van Dijk, Brazil­ian mid­fielder Fabinho moved to cen­tral de­fence and de­liv­ered an as­sured dis­play as Liver­pool beat Ajax 1-0 in their Cham­pi­ons League opener on</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day. Klopp, how­ever, claimed his new-look de­fen­sive line still needs time to set­tle, with the Dutch cap­tain set for an ex­tended spell on the side­lines.</p>
    <p>While Fabinho is fa­mil­iar with the role, hav­ing played there on nu­mer­ous oc­ca­sions in the past two sea­sons and as re­cently as last month’s 2-0 Pre­mier League win over Chelsea, the one con­stant has al­ways been van Dijk.</p>
    <p>Since join­ing in Jan­uary 2018, he has missed only one game and played the last two full Pre­mier League cam­paigns be­fore his in­jury dur­ing the Mersey­side derby.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want to know how long he’ll be out for. It will take time that is clear,” Klopp said.</p>
    <p>“We all know Fab can play this po­si­tion, he did it against Bay­ern (Mu­nich) last year in a home game, for ex­am­ple, and he played great.</p>
    <p>“But this line (part­ner­ing Joe Gomez) had not played to­gether be­fore the Ajax game. You can’t talk about it or ex­change notes, it is about feel­ing what is right. It will take time for th­ese boys to get used to each other.”</p>
    <p>It will likely be the same pair­ing of Fabinho and Gomez at the back, although Klopp said he will give late fit­ness tests to Joel Matip and Thi­ago Al­can­tara. Both play­ers missed the trip to Am­s­ter­dam.</p>
    <p>There will also be a re­u­nion of sorts as Rhian Brew­ster is in line for his full de­but for United af­ter com­ing on as a sub­sti­tute against Ful­ham, ac­cord­ing to Wilder.</p>
    <p>The Eng­land Un­der-21 striker was deemed sur­plus to re­quire­ments and sold for £23.5 mil­lion (S$41.6 mil­lion) dur­ing the trans­fer win­dow.</p>
    <p>But, de­spite Brew­ster fail­ing to</p>
    <p>DIF­FI­CULT SIT­U­A­TION</p>
    <p>(Sh­effield United) de­serve a lot of at­ten­tion for what they do be­cause it is re­ally good... For us, that makes it tricky and they had a full week to pre­pare...</p>

    <p>make the grade at An­field, Klopp is aware of his pedi­gree.</p>
    <p>The Reds in­serted a buy­back clause in case he flour­ishes in new sur­round­ings, and the Ger­man jok­ingly spoke of his wish to see the 20-year-old make a name for him­self, ex­cept against his team.</p>
    <p>Call­ing him “a nat­u­ral fin­isher”, Klopp added: “We all know him very well. That’s the prob­lem – we know how good he is. Rhian used to be our boy but still we feel he is.</p>
    <p>“I wish him a nearly per­fect Pre­mier League sea­son... but two games off when they play us.” REUTERS</p>
