    <p>As Sin­ga­pore works to re­duce in­equal­ity, con­ver­sa­tions about the kind of so­cial com­pact its cit­i­zens want and how to fund that sup­port have to con­tinue, Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Ed­u­ca­tion Ma­liki Os­man said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“There needs to be so­ci­etal con­sen­sus on what is a ba­sic and rea­son­able stan­dard of liv­ing we com­mit to pro­vide to all Sin­ga­pore­ans, bear­ing in mind that in­creases in sup­port and ben­e­fits pro­vided are not free, but ul­ti­mately paid for by ev­ery­one through taxes,” he added.</p>
    <p>Join­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, Dr Ma­liki noted that while Sin­ga­pore has moved to nar­row in­equal­ity, bridg­ing the gap will be­come more dif­fi­cult with time as glob­al­i­sa­tion and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion threaten to leave be­hind those who can­not cope in the new econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ter, for­merly an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s so­cial work and psy­chol­ogy depart­ment, as­sured the House that the Govern­ment pays very close at­ten­tion to nar­row­ing so­cial strat­i­fi­ca­tion, as he sets out ar­eas it in­tends to fo­cus on to tackle it.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans, re­gard­less of their in­come or back­ground, must be able to meet their ba­sic needs and achieve a rea­son­able stan­dard of liv­ing, he said.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes giv­ing chil­dren a good ed­u­ca­tion and pre­par­ing them for adult­hood, giv­ing young peo­ple the as­sur­ance they can ad­vance in the j ob mar­ket, and al­low­ing adults to have job se­cu­rity and pre­pare well for re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ing in ed­u­ca­tion is thus im­por­tant, and the Govern­ment has set aside more re­sources for low-in­come fam­i­lies, he said, cit­ing sub­si­dies they can re­ceive for child­care and school fees, as well as en­hanced bur­saries.</p>
    <p>He added that pub­lic health­care and home own­er­ship are heav­ily sub­sidised, al­low­ing all to meet their fun­da­men­tal needs.</p>
    <p>But there has to be so­cial mo­bil­ity for all to re­duce in­equal­ity in a sus­tain­able way, said Dr Ma­liki, who is also Sec­ond Min­is­ter for For­eign Af­fairs and Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice.</p>
    <p>To achieve it, the coun­try has to put in place a sys­tem wherein ev­ery­one is pro­gress­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has to con­tinue build­ing a strong econ­omy that can give its cit­i­zens good jobs, rea­son­able wages and sus­tained pay rises with im­prove­ments in work­ers’ pro­duc­tiv­ity and skills, he said.</p>
    <p>It needs to also pro­vide greater equal­ity of op­por­tu­nity, he added, by lev­el­ling un­even start­ing blocks for chil­dren and of­fer­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties at ev­ery stage of life.</p>
    <p>The Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry has made sig­nif­i­cant moves to ad­dress this by tak­ing into ac­count the skills and abil­i­ties of in­di­vid­ual stu­dents and go­ing be­yond grades and pa­per qual­i­fi­ca­tions, he added.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, it changed the PSLE scor­ing sys­tem and moved be­yond stream­ing to full sub­ject-based band­ing in schools, he pointed out.</p>
    <p>He also pledged that dis­ad­van­taged fam­i­lies will not be left be­hind, as the min­istry im­proves ac­cess to qual­ity and af­ford­able pre-school ed­u­ca­tion to give all chil­dren a strong foun­da­tion to tem­per in­equal­i­ties they may face.</p>
    <p>“Our start­ing point in life should not dic­tate our end­ing point, and with hard work, abil­ity and am­bi­tion, we can suc­ceed.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans also need to work to­wards a so­ci­ety where suc­cess is not de­fined solely i n eco­nomic terms, and it has to avoid al­low­ing ma­te­rial di­vides to trans­late into so­cial di­vides, said Dr Ma­liki.</p>
    <p>He re­counted a con­ver­sa­tion he had with some youth in his con­stituency that un­set­tled him.</p>
    <p>One said she felt her school­mates looked down on her when they found out she was re­ceiv­ing fi­nan­cial aid, while an­other said he felt a di­vide be­tween him­self and his univer­sity mates be­cause he came from a less pres­ti­gious school.</p>
    <p>To ad­dress this, Dr Ma­liki em­pha­sised that Sin­ga­pore needs a so­ci­ety of op­por­tu­nity un­der­pinned by hu­mil­ity, re­spon­si­bil­ity and a com­mit­ment to treat ev­ery­one as an equal re­gard­less of his or her back­ground.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion is fun­da­men­tal to nur­tur­ing such a so­ci­ety, and the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry will con­tinue to in­stil these val­ues, he said.</p>
    <p>“We must re­main com­mit­ted to the fun­da­men­tal aim of Sin­ga­pore be­ing a place where our ef­forts are re­warded not j ust i n eco­nomic terms, but also in the qual­ity of life we en­joy, and a so­ci­ety where ev­ery­one has a place that is val­ued equally,” he said.</p>
