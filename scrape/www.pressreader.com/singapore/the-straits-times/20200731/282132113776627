    <p>SHEN­ZHEN • China’s Huawei Tech­nolo­gies snatched the ti­tle of big­gest smart­phone seller from South Korea’s Sam­sung Elec­tron­ics in the sec­ond quar­ter, un­der­scor­ing the re­silience of the Chi­nese mar­ket even as global de­mand for cell­phones plunged amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Huawei shipped 55.8 mil­lion de­vices i n the April-June pe­riod, trump­ing Sam­sung’s 53.7 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to data from re­search firm Canalys.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese com­pany has felt the heat of US sanc­tions that have dis­rupted its busi­ness over­seas, but the lat­est num­bers show its ris­ing dom­i­nance in its home mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Huawei now sells nearly twothirds of its hand­sets in China, which took an early hit from the coro­n­avirus out­break but has since re­claimed ground as new cases have dwin­dled. Smart­phone mak­ers dom­i­nant in other coun­tries are still strug­gling as new virus cases con­tinue to rise.</p>
    <p>Huawei’s sales fell 5 per cent from the same quar­ter a year ear­lier, while Sam­sung posted a 30 per cent drop due to weak de­mand in key mar­kets, in­clud­ing Brazil, the United States and Europe.</p>
    <p>“Our busi­ness has demon­strated ex­cep­tional re­silience in these dif­fi­cult times,” a Huawei spokesman said.</p>
    <p>Do­mes­tic sales rose 8 per cent, but Huawei’s over­seas ship­ments fell 27 per cent in the quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s stint as top seller may prove short-lived once other mar­kets re­cover, a se­nior Huawei em­ployee with knowl­edge of the mat­ter told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Sam­sung yes­ter­day said it ex­pects smart­phone de­mand to pick up in the sec­ond half of the year.</p>
    <p>The US has ef­fec­tively blocked Huawei from us­ing Google’s ser­vices, dam­ag­ing the at­trac­tive­ness of the Chi­nese com­pany’s phones abroad, and lim­ited its ac­cess to chips cru­cial for 5G net­work­ing.</p>
    <p>S&P Global Rat­ings said in a report on Wednes­day that the lat­est re­stric­tions on Huawei could wipe out US$25 bil­lion (S$34.4 bil­lion) in rev­enue from sev­eral Asia-based firms. Huawei has yet to pub­licly ad­dress the im­pact these curbs will have on its op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>It re­mains un­clear how much of</p>
    <p>Huawei’s sec­ond-quar­ter sales had been driven by its 5G smart­phones and high-end mod­els that are most vul­ner­a­ble to the re­stric­tions, said Canalys’ vice-pres­i­dent of mo­bil­ity Ni­cole Peng.</p>
