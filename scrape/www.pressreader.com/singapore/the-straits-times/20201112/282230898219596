    <p>China’s fin­tech clam­p­down will prob­a­bly have a lim­ited im­pact on Sin­ga­pore, although it could en­cour­age in­vestors to pivot to the city-state and lo­cal fin­tech com­pa­nies to ex­pand their foot­print in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, China’s top bank­ing watch­dog called for fin­tech firms to be sub­jected to the same su­per­vi­sion and risk man­age­ment re­quire­ments as banks. It had laid out de­tailed reg­u­la­tions aimed at curb­ing anti-com­pet­i­tive be­hav­iour for the first time on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts told The Straits Times that Sin­ga­pore is un­likely to follow a sim­i­lar path as China due to the lack of fin­tech mo­nop­o­lies here.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Fin­Tech As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Chia Hock Lai noted that China’s clam­p­down is tar­geted at fin­tech gi­ants with a sig­nif­i­cant mar­ket share, such as Ant Group and Ten­cent Hold­ings.</p>
    <p>“They are so big that they could cause sys­temic risk, so now the au­thor­i­ties want to sub­ject them to tighter reg­u­la­tions, es­pe­cially if they ex­hibit mo­nop­o­lis­tic be­hav­iour,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, most fin­tech firms in Sin­ga­pore are busi­ness-to-busi­ness (B2B) and us­age of fin­tech for con­sumers is not as per­va­sive as in China, Mr Chia added.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore is a much more ma­ture coun­try in terms of fi­nan­cial reg­u­la­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh from the Na­tional Uni­ver­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School said there is a “reg­u­la­tory asym­me­try” in China: “The banks are sub­ject to stricter reg­u­la­tions, whereas fin­tech was given free rein un­til re­cently. Innovation has gone ahead of reg­u­la­tion, and th­ese two need to move in tan­dem.”</p>
    <p>The clam­p­down is also un­likely to af­fect Sin­ga­pore fin­tech firms’ expansion plans in China as th­ese com­pa­nies usu­ally do not serve the Chi­nese mar­ket due to stiff com­pe­ti­tion, said Mr Chia.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed reg­u­la­tions could also en­cour­age Sin­ga­pore fin­tech firms to move away from China and to­wards other over­seas mar­kets such as those in South-east Asia, he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Loh said un­cer­tainty over the new reg­u­la­tions in China might also cause in­vestors to pivot to South­east Asia, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ment in Sin­ga­pore-based fin­tech firms hit $462 mil­lion in the first half of the year, up 19 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, go­ing for­ward, Chi­nese fin­tech firms might be more cau­tious about ex­pand­ing fur­ther in coun­tries such as Sin­ga­pore, as they fo­cus on ad­just­ing to new reg­u­la­tions at home, added Prof Loh.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore houses the head­quar­ters of Alibaba’s e-com­merce plat­form Lazada. WeChat owner Ten­cent Hold­ings has cho­sen a cowork­ing space for its first of­fice in Sin­ga­pore, re­ported Bloomberg last month. ByteDance, which owns popular video app TikTok, is also mov­ing to a big­ger of­fice here.</p>
