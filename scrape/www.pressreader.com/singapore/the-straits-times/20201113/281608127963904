    <p>South-east Asia’s largest bank DBS will trans­form at least a third of its branches by rolling out 24/7, self-ser­vice bank­ing op­tions and eas­ier ac­cess to fi­nan­cial plan­ning tools in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
    <p>DBS cus­tomers can con­duct more trans­ac­tions, such as re­plac­ing their debit card, out­side of nor­mal bank­ing hours at these re­vamped branches.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors and wealth plan­ning man­agers will also be sta­tioned at the branches to help cus­tomers with their bank­ing and fi­nan­cial plan­ning needs.</p>
    <p>DBS, which op­er­ates 64 branches here, last month opened a 2,000 sq ft branch at</p>
    <p>Takashimay­a Shop­ping Cen­tre – its first branch to of­fer a wider range of per­son­alised bank­ing ser­vices, with more space for safe dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>It is also the bank’s first branch to share a space with a re­tail store – Guardian phar­macy.</p>
    <p>DBS’ ef­forts come amid a broader shift to­wards dig­i­tal bank­ing that has been fu­elled by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of monthly av­er­age vis­its per branch fell by 15 per cent in the months of June to Oc­to­ber, com­pared with be­fore the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>More than 95 per cent of reg­u­lar DBS bank­ing trans­ac­tions such as fund trans­fers, re­mit­tances and bill pay­ments are now done dig­i­tally through mo­bile or on­line bank­ing.</p>
    <p>DBS Sin­ga­pore coun­try head</p>
    <p>Shee Tse Koon said the pan­demic has ir­re­vo­ca­bly changed the way most peo­ple do their bank­ing and catal­ysed fur­ther trans­for­ma­tion to cater to these shift­ing needs.</p>
    <p>He added: “Our new branches will, there­fore, com­ple­ment our dig­i­tal bank­ing ser­vices to pro­vide what we call a ‘phy­gi­tal’ bank­ing ex­pe­ri­ence that re­tains our hu­man touch in the form of face-to-face as­sis­tance and con­sul­ta­tions.”</p>
    <p>The Takashimay­a branch boasts fea­tures such as video teller ma­chines, where cus­tomers can re­place and ap­ply for debit or credit cards and seek help from a bank teller via video, as well as branch teller ma­chines that al­low them to de­posit and with­draw cash in de­nom­i­na­tions start­ing from $2.</p>
    <p>Two or three dig­i­tal am­bas­sadors will be sta­tioned at the branch.</p>
    <p>The branch also of­fers ser­vices tar­geted at busi­nesses in­clud­ing ma­chines where they can de­posit their earn­ings, which will be</p>
    <p>counted and put into their ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Like its co-ten­ant Guardian, the Takashimay­a branch also has a “phar­macy” that of­fers ad­vice on build­ing fi­nan­cial health.</p>
    <p>Its “fi­nan­cial phar­macy” dig­i­tal touch­screen board al­lows cus­tomers to browse fi­nan­cial plan­ning tips, which are vis­ually rep­re­sented by health and beauty item icons on the screen.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, an icon of a jar la­belled “for­ever young” leads cus­tomers to a page that ex­plains the im­por­tance of early in­surance plan­ning.</p>
    <p>DBS is not alone in its ef­forts to trans­form its phys­i­cal branches. Since 2018, OCBC Bank has re­duced its num­ber of tell­ers by half and reskilled them to take on digi</p>
    <p>tal am­bas­sador roles. More than 90 per cent of fi­nan­cial trans­ac­tions are now done dig­i­tally or at smart ATMs that can process 90 per cent of all counter ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Mr Bob Ng, OCBC’s head of per­sonal and pre­mier bank­ing for Sin­ga­pore, said: “This has al­lowed us to mi­grate more than one-third of over-the-counter ser­vices out of the branches, com­pared with five years ago.”</p>
    <p>In 2018, United Over­seas Bank opened a branch in Tampines 1 mall to cater to young pro­fes­sion­als and young fam­i­lies. In­stead of tra­di­tional teller coun­ters, the branch has self-ser­vice ma­chines and spa­ces for cus­tomers to have dis­cus­sions on fi­nan­cial plan­ning.</p>
