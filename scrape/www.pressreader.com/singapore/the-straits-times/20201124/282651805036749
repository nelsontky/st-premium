    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Pop star Tay­lor Swift was named Artist of the Year at the Amer­i­can Mu­sic Awards (AMA) on Sun­day and won two other tro­phies in a cer­e­mony held live in Los An­ge­les amid tight coro­n­avirus curbs.</p>
    <p>It was Swift’s record sixth win of the top prize at the fan-voted show, al­though she was ab­sent from the cer­e­mony and thanked fans on video for their sup­port of her sur­prise lock­down al­bum Folk­lore.</p>
    <p>Cana­dian singers Justin Bieber and The Weeknd – the lat­ter sport­ing a large white face ban­dage – were the other big win­ners, with three awards each.</p>
    <p>Bieber was named Favourite Male Pop/Rock Artist and picked up his two other wins for his col­lab­o­ra­tion with coun­try singers Dan + Shay on 10,000 Hours.</p>
    <p>The Weeknd took home tro­phies for Best Soul/R&B Male Artist as well as for his al­bum Af­ter Hours and the song Heart­less.</p>
    <p>He gave no rea­son for his ban­daged ap­pear­ance, which con­fused fans on so­cial me­dia, but it ap­peared to be an artis­tic choice that started with his March al­bum cover, on which he sported a blood­ied and bro­ken nose.</p>
    <p>The show fea­tured a mix of live and pre-recorded per­for­mances across gen­res such as Latin, coun­try, pop, rap and R&B in front of a hand­ful of so­cially dis­tanced fans.</p>
    <p>“It has been a long year and now that 2020 is com­ing to an end, it’s time to re­mem­ber that we are one coun­try, y’all. We need to heal,” said host Taraji P. Henson as she opened the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Masked dancers were the or­der of the night, kick­ing off with Bieber singing his hits Lonely and Holy be­fore be­ing joined by singer Shawn Men­des for their duet Mon­ster.</p>
    <p>The awards cel­e­brated the surge in pop­u­lar­ity of Latin mu­sic with ex­panded cat­e­gories and a steamy per­for­mance by pop su­per­star Jen­nifer Lopez and Colom­bian singer Maluma singing Lonely in English and Span­ish.</p>
    <p>Becky G, whose par­ents are Mex­i­can-Amer­i­can, won for Best Fe­male Latin Artist and ded­i­cated her award to im­mi­grant work­ers.</p>
    <p>K-pop group BTS won two awards – for Best Pop/Rock Group and Favourite So­cial Artists – and closed the show with a ver­sion of their hits Dynamite and Life Goes</p>
    <p>On from South Korea.</p>
    <p>Rap­per Me­gan Thee Stal­lion marked her de­but per­for­mance at the awards cer­e­mony with Body and later ac­cepted the Best Rap/Hip-hop Song tro­phy for her raunchy sum­mer col­lab­o­ra­tion WAP with fel­low rap­per Cardi B.</p>
    <p>But she was beaten in the Best New Artist cat­e­gory by Los An­ge­les singer Doja Cat, who was also named Favourite Fe­male Soul/R&B Artist.</p>
