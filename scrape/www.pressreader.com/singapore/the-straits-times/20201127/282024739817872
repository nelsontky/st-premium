    <p>We thank Mr Wes­ley Loh for shar­ing his ex­pe­ri­ence on mask-wear­ing as a per­son with dis­abil­ity and his feed­back to raise greater aware­ness on this is­sue (Pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion: Gaps in ef­forts to sup­port those with spe­cial needs, Nov 17).</p>
    <p>As ac­tiv­i­ties and ser­vices re­sume grad­u­ally, we must re­main vig­i­lant and con­tinue to ob­serve safe man­age­ment mea­sures to keep the risks of Covid-19 trans­mis­sion low. The use of masks is manda­tory. Ex­cep­tions can be made only for med­i­cal rea­sons, such as res­pi­ra­tory con­di­tions or sen­sory chal­lenges. Cer­tain per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties may be ex­empted.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment, SG En­able, and the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice de­vel­oped a guide for front-line of­fi­cers, in­clud­ing safe dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors (SDAs) and en­force­ment of­fi­cers (EOs), to raise their aware­ness about spe­cial needs aris­ing from dif­fer­ent types of dis­abil­i­ties. SDAs and EOs can be flex­i­ble when per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties are un­able to com­ply with cer­tain mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Per­sons who can­not tol­er­ate wear­ing masks for med­i­cal rea­sons are en­cour­aged to carry sup­port­ing doc­u­ments, such as a doc­tor’s memo, to fa­cil­i­tate the work of SDAs and EOs. They are urged to ob­serve safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures and stay in­doors as far as pos­si­ble to pro­tect them­selves. For those who can wear masks, in­clud­ing the ma­jor­ity of per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties, masks are manda­tory and im­por­tant for their pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>The guide­lines for front-line of­fi­cers on the needs of per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties can be found on SG En­able’s En­abling Guide web­site, along with re­sources pro­duced by KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hospi­tal and dis­abil­ity so­cial ser­vice agen­cies on how per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties can be kept safe amid Covid-19.</p>
    <p>These guide­lines have also been shared with ma­jor su­per­mar­ket chains, where staff may en­counter shop­pers with dis­abil­i­ties. We are look­ing to fur­ther dis­sem­i­nate the guide­lines to raise aware­ness among more front-line staff and mem­bers of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>We agree with Mr Loh that more can be done to ed­u­cate the pub­lic about dis­abil­i­ties, and to raise aware­ness about sup­port strate­gies for per­sons with dis­abil­i­ties. We will con­tinue to find av­enues to do so, as we work to­gether with the com­mu­nity to build an in­clu­sive, car­ing Sin­ga­pore.</p>
