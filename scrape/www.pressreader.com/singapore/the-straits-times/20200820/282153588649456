    <p>It is fas­ci­nat­ing to dis­cover that the In­ter­net-savvy gen­er­a­tion has pro­duced a bunch of read­ers of English who can read but can­not quite com­pre­hend what they read, and those who can write but whose writ­ings their read­ers strug­gle to un­der­stand.</p>
    <p>This is not con­fined to chil­dren – even adults who have had the ben­e­fit of higher ed­u­ca­tion can be found among this group.</p>
    <p>I have been en­coun­ter­ing teach­ers who are un­able to ar­tic­u­late or ex­plain what they have writ­ten even though they in­sist they un­der­stand it them­selves.</p>
    <p>Inevitably, it be­comes be­wil­der­ing and one ends up ask­ing them ba­sic com­pre­hen­sion ques­tions.</p>
    <p>I must qual­ify that my ob­ser­va­tions are lim­ited to my in­ter­ac­tions with teach­ers who teach sec­ondary school stu­dents.</p>
    <p>I sur­mise most dif­fi­cul­ties in lan­guage com­pre­hen­sion arise from a lack of speak­ing.</p>
    <p>Tex­ting and mes­sag­ing have over­taken oral con­ver­sa­tions over the phone.</p>
    <p>With­out hear­ing one’s own voice, it is hard to cor­rect one’s own in­to­na­tion and enun­ci­a­tion. More im­por­tantly, speak­ing forces one to form sen­tences with proper syn­tax if one wishes to be flu­ent in a lan­guage.</p>
    <p>But with tex­ting and mes­sag­ing, where er­rors may be in­tro­duced per­haps through in­ad­e­quate spell-check soft­ware, we are be­com­ing more care­less about gram­mar and clar­ity.</p>
    <p>We need to go back to the basics – the teach­ing of com­pre­hen­sion must in­clude read­ing aloud.</p>
    <p>I can em­pathise with Fo­rum let­ter writer Liew Kam Wah and his wife (No POSB ma­chine near home, Aug 18)</p>
    <p>I feel this prob­lem can be solved if all banks share their au­to­mated teller ma­chines (ATMs). DBS Bank , UOB and OCBC used to share ATMs but this ended when DBS merged with POSB.</p>
    <p>When it is for the greater good of the coun­try, com­mer­cial de­ci­sions should take se­cond place. We are an age­ing pop­u­la­tion, and hav­ing an ATM nearby would not only be a great help to cus­tomers – es­pe­cially se­niors – but could also prove ad­van­ta­geous for the banks.</p>
    <p>Surely banks can get to­gether and come up with a good so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>With tex­ting and mes­sag­ing, where er­rors may be in­tro­duced per­haps through in­ad­e­quate spell-check soft­ware, we are be­com­ing more care­less about gram­mar and clar­ity.</p>
