    <p>JAYA • Malaysia’s largest party Umno yes­ter­day said it would con­test, at the next gen­eral elec­tion, all the par­lia­men­tary and state seats it won in the 2018 polls, mark­ing its ter­ri­tory ahead of any seat ne­go­ti­a­tions with its al­lies i n the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) rul­ing coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi said the party’s top lead­er­ship – the supreme coun­cil – has de­cided that it will field can­di­dates and re­claim all those seats at the 15th gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“Those are Umno’s seats, and we will re­claim them,” he said in a speech at the Ba­gan Da­toh di­vi­sion meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Umno won 55 par­lia­men­tary seats i n 2018, rep­re­sent­ing nearly a quar­ter of the 222 par­lia­men­tary wards. Af­ter de­fec­tions, it now has 38 law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Zahid also said the supreme coun­cils of both Umno and Barisan Na­sional (BN), the coali­tion led by Umno, had unan­i­mously de­cided to con­test un­der the BN ban­ner.</p>
    <p>“We will not use other lo­gos. It is up to the other par­ties if they want to use their own logo or use their new part­ners’ lo­gos,” he said.</p>
    <p>The 15th gen­eral elec­tion is not due to be called un­til 2023, but Umno has said snap polls should be held as the PN gov­ern­ment l ed by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin holds a slim ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>PN mainly com­prises Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia, Umno, Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia (PAS) and Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral by-elec­tions have been post­poned due to a fresh wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Zahid said a snap elec­tion could be held de­spite the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We un­der­stand that we do not want Covid-19 to spread, but we can still fol­low the stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures. Why must we be afraid to hold a gen­eral elec­tion dur­ing a pan­demic? More than 30 coun­tries have held gen­eral elec­tions while the Covid-19 pan­demic has hit those coun­tries. Why is Malaysia the only coun­try afraid of this?” he said.</p>
    <p>The for­mer deputy prime min­is­ter said that al­though Umno is rep­re­sented by 11 full min­is­ters and sev­eral deputy min­is­ters in the PN gov­ern­ment, it was not a dom­i­nant party in the ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“Umno’s sin­cer­ity and hon­esty are only con­sid­ered as com­ple­men­tary. A com­ple­ment to the cur­rent gov­ern­ment and ad­min­is­tra­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Umno was told to be thank­ful and grate­ful, but the ques­tion is the sup­port from Umno and Barisan’s 43 law­mak­ers to form the gov­ern­ment, which should only be seen as com­ple­men­tary. Who re­ally should be thank­ful here?” asked Zahid.</p>
    <p>He re­it­er­ated that sup­port for the cur­rent gov­ern­ment is only from Umno and BN law­mak­ers and it did not mean he wanted to join PN.</p>
    <p>“The Perikatan pres­i­den­tial coun­cil was formed to out­line the gov­ern­ment’s poli­cies based on the per­spec­tive of each party. The coun­cil is also formed as a check and bal­ance to the poli­cies of the gov­ern­ment of the day. It does not trans­late that we sup­port the for­ma­tion or the reg­is­tra­tion of Perikatan,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added, how­ever, that Umno re­mains com­mit­ted to Muafakat Na­sional, the pact it formed with Is­lamist party PAS.</p>
    <p>Those are Umno’s seats, and we will re­claim them.</p>
