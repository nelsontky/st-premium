    <p>Em­manuel took taek­wondo and pi­ano les­sons on­line dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, while Amelie had bal­let and pi­ano les­sons on­line.</p>
    <p>There was a lot less face-to-face in­ter­ac­tion with teach­ers and friends, and their par­ents needed to find ways to oc­cupy their time at home – by do­ing jig­saw puz­zles as a fam­ily or play­ing Mo­nop­oly.</p>
    <p>Their pa­ter­nal fam­ily is i n France, which means they have not seen them in nine months and do not know when they can see them again.</p>
    <p>They have tried to en­gage their fam­ily in France more – by play­ing</p>
    <p>Hang­man over What­sApp, for ex­am­ple – but it is not the same. The fam­ily will prob­a­bly spend the com­ing Christ­mas – usu­ally a big event for them – apart for the first time.</p>
    <p>Said the sib­lings’ mother, Madam Eeleen Tan, who is Sin­ga­porean: “The chil­dren have learnt to be­come a lot more in­de­pen­dent and out­spo­ken.</p>
    <p>“They have learnt to watch the clock for when it is time to do on­line les­sons, and how to print out ma­te­ri­als sent by teach­ers ahead of class.</p>
    <p>“They have also learnt to give a sum­mary to teach­ers of where they are at vis-a-vis pre­vi­ous class, as well as the dif­fi­cul­ties they faced learn­ing on their own.”</p>
