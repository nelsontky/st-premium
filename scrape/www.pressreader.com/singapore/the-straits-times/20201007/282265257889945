    <p>A pro­posed takeover of one of Malaysia’s top real es­tate com­pa­nies, Eco World De­vel­op­ment Group, through a con­tro­ver­sial merger plan spear­headed by sov­er­eign fund Khaz­anah Na­sional is rais­ing con­cerns that Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s ad­min­is­tra­tion is bow­ing to pres­sure to bail out po­lit­i­cally well-con­nected firms us­ing pub­lic funds.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment to the Malaysian stock ex­change on Mon­day, Khaz­anah-con­trolled UEM Group said it was propos­ing a share swap trans­ac­tion be­tween its pub­licly listed prop­erty arm UEM Sun­rise and Eco World.</p>
    <p>The deal – which was first mooted late last year but re­jected by the pre­vi­ous Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) gov­ern­ment – will re­sult in Eco World be­com­ing a fully owned sub­sidiary of UEM Sun­rise and sub­se­quently sur­ren­der­ing its listing sta­tus on Bursa Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Eco World founder Liew Kee Sin will also be re­duced to a mi­nor­ity share­holder in the en­larged en­tity UEM Sun­rise, with his fam­ily’s in­ter­est in the Khaz­anah en­tity amount­ing to just over 6 per cent af­ter the com­ple­tion of the share swap deal.</p>
    <p>“Given the sub­dued macroe­co­nomic con­di­tions and mar­ket head­winds, we be­lieve that there is a press­ing need for in­dus­try play­ers to con­sol­i­date re­sources and ca­pa­bil­i­ties to strengthen per­for­mance and sus­tain­abil­ity,” said UEM Group, adding that the merger will “en­hance the merged en­tity’s scale, di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and ex­e­cu­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties to cre­ate a ro­bust business plat­form for fu­ture de­vel­op­ment”.</p>
    <p>But ini­tial mar­ket sen­ti­ment to­wards the pro­posed trans­ac­tion has been less than pos­i­tive, with many bankers and in­vest­ment an­a­lysts not­ing that the deal could un­der­mine al­ready weak in­vestor sen­ti­ment that has been dulled by the coun­try’s frag­ile pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>In­vest­ment an­a­lysts said Khaz­anah was be­ing tapped to bail out a com­pany that is sad­dled with debts of more than RM3.7 bil­lion (S$1.2 bil­lion) against a back­drop of de­clin­ing sales in Eco World’s de­vel­op­ment projects in both Malaysia and its in­ter­na­tional oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“All UEM is do­ing is in­her­it­ing more headaches in re­turn for pro­vid­ing the Eco World share­holder with an exit strat­egy from their debt obli­ga­tions,” said a chief ex­ec­u­tive of a bou­tique in­vest­ment con­sult­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mr Daim Zain­ud­din, for­mer fi­nance min­is­ter and eco­nomic ad­viser of the pre­vi­ous PH gov­ern­ment, noted on Mon­day that his op­po­si­tion to the deal when it was first mooted last year has not changed.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, a senior aide at Mr Daim’s of­fice noted that “when the deal was pro­posed, Tun Daim was against bailouts of this kind and his po­si­tion re­mains the same”.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed trans­ac­tion has also drawn flak from the vo­cal youth wing of Umno, a key party in Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional coali­tion gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“In our view, this merger is serv­ing the same ob­jec­tive, as our as­sump­tions last year, in bail­ing out Eco World. They are in a bad sit­u­a­tion... they seem to be us­ing the gov­ern­ment to bail them out,” said Mr Mo­hamed Nizam Ab­dul­lah Hamdi the chief of the Umno Youth Fed­eral Ter­ri­to­ries chap­ter.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed UEM Sun­rise-Eco World deal is also draw­ing crit­i­cism of a bailout be­cause it is not the first time that the com­pany has been scout­ing around for a merger part­ner.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the deal was re­jected late last year by the PH gov­ern­ment, Eco World’s share­hold­ers had ini­ti­ated ne­go­ti­a­tions to merge with the prop­erty arm of con­glom­er­ate Sime Darby.</p>
    <p>But that plan was dashed when it was re­jected by Sime Darby’s main share­holder, state-owned in­vest­ment arm Per­modalan Na­sional Ber­had (PNB).</p>
    <p>The con­tro­ver­sial bid by UEM Sun­rise for Eco World comes at a time when there are grow­ing con­cerns about the over­all health of cor­po­rate Malaysia and the ex­pected fall­out aris­ing from the ex­piry at the end of last month of the stateim­posed mora­to­rium for cor­po­rates and house­holds to ser­vice their bank bor­row­ings due to the ad­verse eco­nomic con­di­tions trig­gered by the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s once hard-charg­ing prop­erty sec­tor is set to be a ma­jor ca­su­alty. A boom fu­elled by easy credit that be­gan shortly af­ter the 1998 re­gional eco­nomic cri­sis spawned huge prof­its for de­vel­op­ers and en­cour­aged spec­u­la­tion, push­ing prices to record lev­els. But the years of ex­u­ber­ance have led to a huge prop­erty over­hang.</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Na­tional Prop­erty In­for­ma­tion Cen­tre es­ti­mated that the coun­try’s prop­erty over­hang at the end of last year stood at 51,265 units com­pris­ing com­pleted but un­sold res­i­den­tial units, ser­vice apart­ments, shop units and in­dus­trial prop­er­ties, col­lec­tively val­ued at RM35.76 bil­lion. This spike rep­re­sented a 213 per cent in­crease in value over the five years be­tween 2014 and last year.</p>
    <p>Few com­pa­nies em­bod­ied that prop­erty boom like Eco World and its founder, Tan Sri Liew, who first stamped his mark as one of Malaysia’s top de­vel­op­ers through his flag­ship SP Se­tia in the 1990s be­fore the com­pany was taken over by PNB in 2014.</p>
    <p>Eco World was set up shortly af­ter Mr Liew and his part­ners, in­clud­ing po­lit­i­cally well-con­nected lawyer-turned-busi­ness­man Ab­dul Rashid Manaf, took over a small Jo­hor-based listed en­tity called Fo­cal Aims, which is closely re­lated to Malaysia’s po­lit­i­cally well-con­nected ty­coon Syed Mokhtar Al­bukhary.</p>
    <p>Eco World’s po­lit­i­cal pedi­gree comes from Mr Liew’s strong links to Tan Sri Syed Mokhtar, who is widely seen as a strong as­so­ciate of for­mer premier Ma­hathir Mo­hamad. Mr Syed Mokhtar is also seen as a very close sup­porter of Mr Muhyid­din, a re­la­tion­ship that was forged when the Premier served as the chief min­is­ter of Jo­hor.</p>
    <p>Eco World ex­panded ag­gres­sively in Malaysia and also with overseas ven­tures in London and Aus­tralia through its 27 per cen­towned as­so­ciate en­tity Eco World In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>De­spite the op­po­si­tion to the deal, most bankers ex­pect the pro­posed UEM Sun­rise-Eco World deal to be ap­proved by share­hold­ers of the re­spec­tive con­cerns.</p>
    <p>“For the deal to reach this stage does sug­gest that this has the back­ing of the gov­ern­ment and the deal will go through,” said a banker with a state-con­trolled fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion.</p>
