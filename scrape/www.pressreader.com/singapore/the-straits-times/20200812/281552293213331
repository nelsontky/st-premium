    <p>Op­po­si­tion can­di­date Svet­lana Tikhanovsk­aya fled from Be­larus to Lithua­nia af­ter com­ing un­der pres­sure. Po­lice cracked down on pro­test­ers across the coun­try for the sec­ond night, fol­low­ing Pres­i­dent Alexander Lukashenko’s claim to a land­slide elec­tion vic­tory in Sun­day’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>MINSK • The main chal­lenger in Be­larus’ dis­puted pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, Ms Svet­lana Tikhanovsk­aya, fled to Lithua­nia af­ter com­ing un­der pres­sure in a seven-hour en­counter with of­fi­cials that left her with lit­tle choice, Lithua­nia’s For­eign Min­is­ter said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“She ap­par­ently felt a cer­tain pres­sure and did not have very much choice but to leave the coun­try,” said Mr Li­nas Linke­vi­cius.</p>
    <p>He said the pres­i­den­tial can­di­date was now “safe” and with her chil­dren, fol­low­ing a sec­ond night of clashes in the au­thor­i­tar­ian for­mer Soviet re­pub­lic af­ter a dis­puted elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Linke­vi­cius said Ms Tikhanovsk­aya came un­der pres­sure dur­ing the marathon meet­ing at the Be­larus cen­tral elec­tion com­mis­sion late on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>She has a Lithua­nian visa and the Be­larus au­thor­i­ties did not hin­der her de­par­ture, he said, adding that he did not know her fu­ture plans.</p>
    <p>The of­fice of Lithua­nian Pres­i­dent Gi­tanas Nauseda said Ms Tikhanovsk­aya was “rest­ing” in the Baltic state.</p>
    <p>Ms Tikhanovsk­aya, a po­lit­i­cal novice who only en­tered the fray af­ter her blog­ger hus­band was jailed, has claimed vic­tory against Pres­i­dent Alexander Lukashenko.</p>
    <p>A mem­ber of the Euro­pean Union and Nato, Lithua­nia, which was also once part of the Soviet Union, has a his­tory of grant­ing refuge to Be­laru­sian and Rus­sian op­po­si­tion fig­ures.</p>
    <p>The Lithua­nian cap­i­tal Vil­nius also hosts an EU-funded Be­laru­sian univer­sity in ex­ile, the Euro­pean Hu­man­i­ties Univer­sity, af­ter Mr Lukashenko shut it down in 2004.</p>
    <p>In a show of sol­i­dar­ity with Be­laru­sian pro­test­ers, the city lit up its four bridges overnight in whitered-white – the his­tor­i­cal Be­laru­sian flag used by op­po­si­tion ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a man died in the protests in Be­larus as thou­sands took to the streets of the cap­i­tal Minsk late on Mon­day, say­ing Mr Lukashenko had stolen the elec­tion from Ms Tikhanovsk­aya to claim a sixth term.</p>
    <p>The po­lice used rub­ber bul­lets, stun grenades and tear gas but demon­stra­tors fought back with stones and fire­works and built makeshift bar­ri­cades, ac­cord­ing to AFP re­porters, pro­test­ers and wit­nesses who de­scribed chaotic scenes of de­fi­ance.</p>
    <p>Separately, in the cap­i­tal Minsk, state me­dia re­leased a video yes­ter­day show­ing Ms Tikhanovsk­aya urg­ing sup­port­ers not to protest, but her al­lies said it was recorded un­der pres­sure.</p>
    <p>She ap­peared to read from a pre­pared state­ment call­ing for “re­spect for the law” and for Be­laru­sians not to take to the streets.</p>
    <p>Ms Tikhanovsk­aya posted an emo­tional video on YouTube from Lithua­nia yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“I thought this cam­paign had hard­ened me a lot and given me enough strength to with­stand any­thing. But prob­a­bly I’m still that weak woman I was at the start,” she said.</p>
    <p>“God for­bid you face the choice that I did, so peo­ple, take care of your­selves. No life is worth what’s hap­pen­ing now. Chil­dren are the most im­por­tant thing in our lives.”</p>
    <p>There was “un­ac­cept­able state vi­o­lence against peace­ful pro­test­ers,” EU for­eign pol­icy chief Josep Bor­rell said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Poland has urged the bloc to call an emer­gency sum­mit on the cri­sis, while Ger­many said Be­larus failed to meet min­i­mum elec­tion stan­dards.</p>
