    <p>STOCK­HOLM • Swe­den’s top health au­thor­ity said peo­ple who have had the coro­n­avirus are likely to be im­mune for at l east six months after be­ing in­fected, whether they have de­vel­oped an­ti­bod­ies or not.</p>
    <p>In new guid­ance pub­lished on Tues­day, the Swedish Pub­lic Health Agency said it is now con­sid­ered safe for in­di­vid­u­als who had been in­fected to come into con­tact with peo­ple in high-risk groups.</p>
    <p>“We don’t see cases of peo­ple fall­ing ill twice from Covid-19,” state epi­demi­ol­o­gist An­ders Teg­nell said dur­ing a press con­fer­ence in Stock­holm. “Hence, our as­sess­ment is that if you do get Covid-19, you are im­mune even if you don’t de­velop an­ti­bod­ies.”</p>
    <p>But the agency also said peo­ple deemed to be im­mune can still act as carriers of the virus, and must there­fore con­tinue to ob­serve so­cial dis­tanc­ing and hy­giene guide­lines.</p>
    <p>The an­ti­body re­sponse to Covid-19 is be­ing closely stud­ied by sci­en­tists around the world for in­di­ca­tions of how long-last­ing such im­mu­nity may be.</p>
    <p>Re­search from Swe­den’s Karolin­ska In­sti­tute has in­di­cated that about twice as many peo­ple in­fected by Covid-19 have de­vel­oped a T-cell me­di­ated im­mu­nity re­sponse as those who have a de­tectable level of an­ti­bod­ies.</p>
    <p>T-cells ap­pear to play an im­por­tant role in pro­tect­ing against re­in­fec­tion with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Dr Teg­nell said Swe­den “prob­a­bly” has achieved a fairly high rate of im­mu­nity, which he pre­dicts will pro­tect his coun­try from new out­breaks. He re­mains a con­tro­ver­sial fig­ure for his de­ci­sion to ad­vise against im­pos­ing a proper lock­down in Swe­den.</p>
