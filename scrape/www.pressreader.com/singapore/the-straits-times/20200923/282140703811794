    <p>A Bangladesh­i painter who stran­gled his In­done­sian girl­friend af­ter she re­fused to leave a new man she was see­ing told the High Court yes­ter­day that he and the vic­tim had promised, at a mosque, to marry each other.</p>
    <p>Ahmed Salim, 31, had even put a ring on her fin­ger at a party with his friends in 2017, an event that was cap­tured on a photo in his mo­bile phone and shown to the court.</p>
    <p>“I treated her as my wife, I never looked at any other woman... the clothes she wore, the things she had, were bought with my money,” he said through a Ben­gali in­ter­preter.</p>
    <p>Ahmed is on trial for mur­der­ing his girl­friend of six years, do­mes­tic worker Nurhi­day­ati Wartono Su­rata, 34, in a room at the Golden Dragon Ho­tel in Gey­lang on the evening of Dec 30, 2018. Prose­cu­tors ac­cuse him of in­tend­ing to kill the woman.</p>
    <p>In his po­lice state­ments, Ahmed said he de­cided to kill the woman af­ter he found out about her new boyfriend on Dec 9, 2018. He also told the po­lice that he killed her with a rope be­cause it was easy to keep in his pocket, com­pared with sharp weapons like knives.</p>
    <p>The de­fence con­tended that his men­tal re­spon­si­bil­ity for the killing was re­duced due to a psy­chi­atric dis­or­der and that he had been pro­voked.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing the stand yes­ter­day, Ahmed said he had been an­gry with the woman for cheat­ing on him many times but he let it go be­cause he loved her.</p>
    <p>The break­ing point came when she told him that her new boyfriend was bet­ter in bed than he was, and he stran­gled her with a towel from the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>He then re­moved the towel and wound the rope around her neck.</p>
    <p>Ahmed broke down when he was asked by his lawyer Chooi Jing Yen to de­scribe his men­tal state when his po­lice state­ments were taken.</p>
    <p>He said he knew he would be hanged. “I also want to be hanged. She has died and I also want to die. I don’t want to live.”</p>
    <p>He cried again when he told the court that when he saw the fe­male in­ves­ti­gat­ing of­fi­cer who was tak­ing his state­ment, he was re­minded of his dead girl­friend.</p>
    <p>“When I saw her, I hated my­self so much that be­cause of a woman, I de­stroyed my life, I de­stroyed that per­son. I came to Sin­ga­pore and I de­stroyed ev­ery­thing.”</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues.</p>
