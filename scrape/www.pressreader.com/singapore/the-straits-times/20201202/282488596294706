    <p>• Play­ers will skip the Aus­tralian Open if they are not al­lowed to prac­tise dur­ing their manda­tory two-week quar­an­tine due to the risk of in­jury, Daniel Val­lverdu, who has coached some of the big­gest names on the ATP Tour, said.</p>
    <p>Ten­nis Aus­tralia (TA) has been in talks with the Vic­to­ria state gov­ern­ment over the Covid-19 pro­to­cols to be es­tab­lished for those ar­riv­ing ahead of the Grand Slam at Melbourne Park, which is sched­uled for Jan 18-31.</p>
    <p>State of­fi­cials have con­firmed play­ers will have to un­dergo quar­an­tine and that the tour­na­ment will likely start one or two weeks later than sched­uled.</p>
    <p>Val­lverdu, who cur­rently works with three-time Grand Slam win­ner Stan Wawrinka, said TA had pre­vi­ously as­sured play­ers they would be able to prac­tise but noth­ing has been con­firmed.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously that would be the only way that it would work for the play­ers if they’re al­lowed to prac­tise,” the 34-year-old, who has also worked with Grand Slam cham­pi­ons Andy Mur­ray and Juan Martin del Potro, said from Monaco.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause they wouldn’t be able to just sit in a ho­tel room for two weeks and then start and play five sets in a Grand Slam. It’s just im­pos­si­ble phys­i­cally, the risk of in­jury is too high. The only way the play­ers will go to Aus­tralia is if they’re fully al­lowed to prac­tise dur­ing those two weeks.</p>
    <p>“So close to the event, not be­ing able to prac­tise for 14 days would just be not doable for them.”</p>
    <p>Due to bor­der re­stric­tions be­tween states and var­ied quar­an­tine re­quire­ments by lo­cal gov­ern­ments, TA also plans to move all build-up tour­na­ments lead­ing to the Grand Slam to Vic­to­ria, which has not re­ported a lo­cally ac­quired case of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tion for over a month.</p>
    <p>TA chief ex­ec­u­tive Craig Ti­ley said he ex­pected to fi­nalise the de­tails for the Slam “very soon”, while Vic­to­rian Sports Min­is­ter Martin Pakula also said the gov­ern­ment was con­fi­dent the event would go ahead early next year.</p>
