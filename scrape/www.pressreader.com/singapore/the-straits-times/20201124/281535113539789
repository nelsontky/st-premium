    <p>Malaysia’s Trans­port Min­is­ter has as­sured Johor’s Sul­tan Ibrahim Iskan­dar that the Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem Link be­tween Johor Baru and Sin­ga­pore will be com­pleted by 2026. His min­istry hopes the project would bring pos­i­tive eco­nomic im­pact to in­dus­tries such as tourism and real es­tate, es­pe­cially in Johor.</p>
    <p>JOHOR BARU • Malaysian Trans­port Min­is­ter Wee Ka Siong has as­sured Johor’s Sul­tan Ibrahim Iskan­dar, that the Rapid Tran­sit Sys­tem (RTS) Link be­tween Johor Baru and Sin­ga­pore will be com­pleted within the stip­u­lated time frame.</p>
    <p>In a video pre­sented dur­ing the vir­tual ground-break­ing cer­e­mony of the mega project and posted on his Face­book page on Sun­day, Datuk Seri Wee said the project will bring max­i­mum pos­i­tive im­pact to the people of Johor.</p>
    <p>“As the rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the Trans­port Min­istry, which is the over­seer of the project, I as­sure the com­mit­ment of the gov­ern­ment in mak­ing sure that the project would be car­ried out ef­fec­tively and in an or­gan­ised man­ner, while also be­ing com­pleted by the set time, which is by 2026,” he said.</p>
    <p>His min­istry hopes the project would bring pos­i­tive eco­nomic im­pact to in­dus­tries such as tourism and real es­tate, es­pe­cially in Johor.</p>
    <p>In an­other Face­book post, Mr Wee said the RTS Link will func­tion as a cost-ef­fec­tive trans­porta­tion sys­tem that prom­ises to boost con­nec­tiv­ity. It would also pro­vide easy, fast and com­fort­able ac­cess to the people who travel across the Malaysia-Sin­ga­pore bor­der. “This would also solve the traf­fic con­ges­tion prob­lem faced at the en­try points of both coun­tries that has been go­ing on for years,” he said.</p>
    <p>When com­pleted, the jour­ney be­tween Bukit Cha­gar sta­tion in Johor Baru and Wood­lands North sta­tion in Sin­ga­pore will take only five min­utes. The RTS can ferry up to 288,000 people per day.</p>
    <p>Malaysia – through its Trans­port Min­istry – will be fork­ing out RM3.715 bil­lion (S$1.22 bil­lion) or 39 per cent of the to­tal cost of the 4km link project, with the bal­ance to be borne by Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Com­muters will have to clear im­mi­gra­tion only once, at the point of de­par­ture.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Johor res­i­dents are ex­cited that the project has fi­nally started, as many have been wait­ing for it for more than a decade.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness­man S. Sures, 48, said: “It will al­low Johor, es­pe­cially Johor Baru, to ben­e­fit from the higher num­ber of vis­i­tors from Sin­ga­pore en­ter­ing through the RTS.”</p>
    <p>“Most lo­cal busi­nesses are highly de­pen­dent on vis­i­tors from Sin­ga­pore. The RTS will bring pos­i­tive eco­nomic growth to the state, in­clud­ing for small busi­nesses like mine,” said the owner of a shop sell­ing clothes and tex­tiles.</p>
    <p>Easy ac­cess to pub­lic trans­porta­tion across the bor­der will help the south­ern Malaysian state re­cover from the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic. “If the project is com­pleted as sched­uled, which is by 2026, it can help us re­build the econ­omy,” he added.</p>
    <p>Restau­rant owner Tan Kim Hock, 58, is ex­pect­ing the RTS Link to bring more cus­tomers from the Repub­lic to his shop, as well as mak­ing it eas­ier for him to visit his fam­ily mem­bers in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“The con­ges­tion at the Cause­way and Sec­ond Link has been a huge prob­lem. I have, at times, can­celled trips to Sin­ga­pore due to the traf­fic. I hope the RTS Link can end my travel woes,” he said.</p>
    <p>Taxi driver Ab­dul Razak Abd Rah­man, 57, said the RTS would boost the tourism in­dus­try in Johor.</p>
    <p>“I think it would not only bring pos­i­tive spillover im­pact on Johor Baru but also other districts in the state, such as Mers­ing and Kota Tinggi, that are fa­mous for their beaches and is­lands,” he said.</p>
    <p>School teacher Ngoi Fee Min, 38, said the RTS means that those work­ing in Sin­ga­pore can come home more of­ten with­out hav­ing to sit through hours of traf­fic on the Cause­way.</p>
    <p>She said her hus­band, a tech­ni­cal team man­ager, com­muted to and fro be­tween Johor Baru and Sin­ga­pore daily be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, but de­cided to re­main in Sin­ga­pore, as he got tired of the traf­fic jam. “Hope­fully, with the RTS, my hus­band can move back home and we can spend more time to­gether as a fam­ily,” she said.</p>
    <p>And those study­ing in Sin­ga­pore “can ben­e­fit, as they do not need to wake up at 3am or 4am just to beat the jam to travel across the Cause­way”, said the mother of two.</p>
