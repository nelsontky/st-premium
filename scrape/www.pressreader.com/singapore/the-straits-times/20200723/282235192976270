    <p>The Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) has slapped a $1.1 mil­lion penalty on in­ter­na­tional trust Asiac­iti Trust for in­ad­e­quate safe­guards against money laun­der­ing and ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing – in­clud­ing its fail­ure to mon­i­tor un­usu­ally large trans­ac­tions by “po­lit­i­cally ex­posed” cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yesterday, MAS said Asiac­iti Trust (ATSPL) com­mit­ted var­i­ous “se­ri­ous breaches” span­ning over a decade, in­clud­ing fail­ing to mon­i­tor higher-risk cus­tomers more strin­gently.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, the com­pany failed to look into the back­ground and pur­pose of “un­usu­ally large trans­ac­tions with no ob­vi­ous economic pur­pose” un­der­taken by “po­lit­i­cally ex­posed per­sons”. Here, MAS is re­fer­ring to in­di­vid­u­als en­trusted with prom­i­nent pub­lic func­tions do­mes­ti­cally, in a for­eign coun­try or in an in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>They may in­clude heads of state, gov­ern­ment lead­ers or se­nior ex­ec­u­tives of state-owned cor­po­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>“De­spite th­ese un­usual cir­cum­stances, ATSPL did not con­sider if there were grounds for sus­pi­cion that would war­rant the fil­ing of sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tion re­ports,” MAS said. The au­thor­ity also found that the com­pany had fallen short of safe­guards to as­sess if its busi­ness con­tact with rel­e­vant par­ties pre­sented a higher risk for money laun­der­ing or ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>MAS cited a case where this lack caused the com­pany to fail in prop­erly es­tab­lish­ing the source of wealth for an ef­fec­tive con­troller – re­fer­ring to the per­son who owns or con­trols the set­t­lor or trustee.</p>
    <p>“ATSPL had sim­ply re­lied on the in­di­vid­ual’s rep­re­sen­ta­tions re­gard­ing his source of wealth without ob­tain­ing in­for­ma­tion to ad­e­quately cor­rob­o­rate his claims,” said MAS.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s mea­sures against money laun­der­ing and ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing were also not sub­ject to in­de­pen­dent au­dits, MAS pointed out.</p>
    <p>Th­ese fail­ures took place be­tween 2007 and 2018, and were iden­ti­fied by the MAS in an in­spec­tion.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­ity said ATSPL has taken re­me­dial mea­sures, such as by re­view­ing cus­tomer ac­counts and trans­ac­tions and ter­mi­nat­ing a num­ber of higher-risk trust ac­counts.</p>
