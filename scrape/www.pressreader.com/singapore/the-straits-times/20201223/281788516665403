    <p>The Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, the EU’s ex­ec­u­tive body, has ap­proved the Pfizer-BioNTech coro­n­avirus vac­cine for use across the bloc’s 27 mem­ber states, hours af­ter the Euro­pean Medicines Agency (EMA) is­sued a rec­om­men­da­tion yes­ter­day in favour of the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Com­mis­sion pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen said the first batches would be shipped from the man­u­fac­tur­ing site in the com­ing days for dis­tri­bu­tion across the EU.</p>
    <p>“This is a very good way to fi­nally start turn­ing the page on Covid-19,” Dr von der Leyen noted, adding that the vac­cine is “a true Euro­pean suc­cess story”.</p>
    <p>The way is now open for a pos­si­ble start of vac­ci­na­tions in Europe on Dec 27.</p>
    <p>The EMA had ini­tially set Dec 29 as the date to an­nounce its de­ci­sion on the ad­mis­si­bil­ity of the vac­cine, roughly three weeks af­ter Bri­tain be­came the first coun­try to au­tho­rise the jab.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, Euro­pean of­fi­cials scoffed at Bri­tain’s rush, con­trast­ing it un­favourably with the sup­pos­edly more rig­or­ous au­tho­ri­sa­tion pro­ce­dures im­ple­mented by the bloc.</p>
    <p>Although few EU of­fi­cials said so pub­licly, in pri­vate many of them im­plied that Bri­tain’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to be the first to in­tro­duce the vac­cine was po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated.</p>
    <p>The sug­ges­tion was that the move was prompted by the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment’s de­sire to prove to its peo­ple the al­leged ben­e­fits of be­ing out­side the Euro­pean Union, which Bri­tain left at the start of this year.</p>
    <p>Thus, while Bri­tain’s medicine reg­u­la­tory body used emer­gency pro­vi­sions to rush through the vac­cine’s ap­proval for Bri­tish pa­tients, the EMA claimed it was sub­ject­ing the Covid-19 vac­cine prod­ucts to its stan­dard and la­bo­ri­ous ex­am­i­na­tion pro­ce­dure be­fore these could be made avail­able to EU citizens.</p>
    <p>“A vac­cine’s ben­e­fits in pro­tect­ing peo­ple against Covid-19 must be far greater than any side ef­fect or po­ten­tial risks,” the EMA pro­claimed sternly in a press re­lease last week, seek­ing to fend off ques­tions about its al­legedly slow work­ing pro­ce­dures.</p>
    <p>Yet be­hind the scenes, the Euro­pean reg­u­la­tor came un­der heavy pres­sure to grant ap­proval as quickly as pos­si­ble. And most of the pres­sure came from Ger­many, the home coun­try of the vac­cine which the whole world now wants but which Ger­man citizens, fac­ing soar­ing in­fec­tion rates, can­not ac­cess.</p>
    <p>Hence, the reg­u­la­tor who claimed it would not be rushed mys­te­ri­ously dis­cov­ered that it could, af­ter all, shave off al­most a week from its ap­proval pro­ce­dure.</p>
    <p>Yet this is hardly the end of the story, for a new con­tro­versy is de­vel­op­ing over the EU’s prepa­ra­tions for the mass vac­ci­na­tion cam­paign to come.</p>
    <p>BioNTech and Pfizer ini­tially of­fered the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion a to­tal of 400 mil­lion doses of the vac­cine. But it chose to buy only 200 mil­lion doses, with an op­tion for 100 mil­lion more.</p>
    <p>Why the com­mis­sion turned down the of­fer of a more sig­nif­i­cant sup­ply was never ad­e­quately ex­plained; Euro­pean of­fi­cials claim that, like other pur­chas­ing bod­ies around the world, they de­cided to spread their ini­tial or­ders to other man­u­fac­tur­ers as well.</p>
    <p>How­ever, an in­ves­ti­ga­tion by Der Spiegel news mag­a­zine, one of Ger­many’s most re­spected pub­li­ca­tions, claims that the real rea­son the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion de­clined to pur­chase the full quota of 400 mil­lion doses is that it came un­der pres­sure from France to re­serve part of the to­tal EU or­der for Sanofi, a French phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal man­u­fac­turer which is also racing ahead with its vac­cine.</p>
    <p>EU of­fi­cials flatly deny the ac­cu­sa­tion. Still, the fact re­mains that the Sanofi vac­cine now looks un­likely to ma­te­ri­alise be­fore the sec­ond half of next year, and Europe may end up short on the vac­cines it needs for a swift in­oc­u­la­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>There is a pos­i­tive side to this story: that of Euro­pean sol­i­dar­ity.</p>
    <p>Legally, health ques­tions do not come un­der the ju­ris­dic­tion of the</p>
    <p>EU, but its mem­ber states. Yet the 27 mem­ber na­tions de­cided to club to­gether and em­power the com­mis­sion to pro­cure and dis­trib­ute vac­cines eq­ui­tably among them, based on their in­di­vid­ual rel­a­tive pop­u­la­tion size, a move which en­sures that poorer and smaller EU coun­tries will be sup­ported.</p>
    <p>“We have made a very con­scious de­ci­sion to go down this path to­gether at a Euro­pean level be­cause we are stronger to­gether. This is true in this pan­demic, in ev­ery­day life, in tak­ing care of each other, but it is also true in Euro­pean sol­i­dar­ity,” Ger­many’s Health Min­is­ter Jens Spahn told his coun­try’s MPs.</p>
    <p>Be that as it may, the EU has not suc­ceeded in avoid­ing ac­cu­sa­tions that its vac­cine process is still sub­ject to po­lit­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>And while claim­ing that ev­ery­thing is un­der con­trol, both EU of­fi­cials and politi­cians of in­di­vid­ual mem­ber states are now scram­bling to se­cure ad­di­tional vac­cine sup­plies.</p>
    <p>An in­ves­ti­ga­tion by Der Spiegel news mag­a­zine, one of Ger­many’s most re­spected pub­li­ca­tions, claims that the real rea­son the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion de­clined to pur­chase the full quota of 400 mil­lion doses is that it came un­der pres­sure from France to re­serve part of the to­tal EU or­der for Sanofi, a French phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal man­u­fac­turer which is also racing ahead with its vac­cine. EU of­fi­cials flatly deny the ac­cu­sa­tion.</p>
