    <p>An­chor op­er­a­tor or part­ner op­er­a­tor? Montes­sori or play-based learn­ing? Childcare or kin­der­garten?</p>
    <p>These terms may baf­fle first­time par­ents weigh­ing up a preschool for their child, so The Straits Times has laid out some of the op­tions on of­fer and high­lighted the lat­est ed­u­ca­tional trends in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>There is cer­tainly no short­age of choice – the num­ber of childcare cen­tres has grown from just over 1,000 in 2012 to 1,530, pro­vid­ing full- and half-day care pro­grammes to chil­dren un­der seven.</p>
    <p>Kinder­gartens, on the other hand, have pro­grammes typ­i­cally last­ing three to four hours. These cen­tres cater to chil­dren from 18 months to be­low seven. Some kinder­gartens have two ses­sions a day.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of such cen­tres has dipped from around 500 in 2012 to 400 to­day, with fall­ing en­rol­ment.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, childcare en­rol­ment has surged, as more par­ents head back to work and need their chil­dren to be taken care of for longer hours, prompt­ing some pre-school op­er­a­tors to switch to childcare.</p>
    <p>The Early Child­hood De­velop</p>
    <p>ment Agency (ECDA), which over­sees the pre-school sec­tor, started in 2013 and has been driv­ing ini­tia­tives to raise qual­ity and ac­ces­si­bil­ity in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>It has also in­creased pre-school sub­si­dies and al­lowed more fam­i­lies to ben­e­fit from ex­tra sub­si­dies to make ed­u­ca­tion in the early years more af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>In­creased state in­volve­ment means 80 per cent of chil­dren will have a place in a gov­ern­mentsup­ported pre-school by around 2025, up from just over 50 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>This growth will be driven pri­mar­ily through se­lected pre-school play­ers, which have an­chor-op­er­a­tor and part­ner-op­er­a­tor sta­tus.</p>
    <p>Un­der these schemes, preschool op­er­a­tors re­ceive grants that help off­set costs such as staff salaries, in re­turn for meet­ing fee caps and qual­ity cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>There are five an­chor op­er­a­tors, in­clud­ing PAP Com­mu­nity Foun­da­tion’s Sparkle­tots and NTUC First Cam­pus’ My First Skool. They have to keep to a monthly fee cap of $720 for full-day childcare, ex­clud­ing goods and ser­vices tax.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 324 childcare cen­tres run by 29 op­er­a­tors or con­sor­tia have been ap­pointed to the new part­ner-op­er­a­tor term that starts next month.</p>
    <p>The fee cap for cen­tres un­der this term will be set at $760 a month for full-day childcare, $40 less than the $800 now.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the quan­tum of gov­ern­ment sup­port for pre-schools has risen from $360 mil­lion in 2012 to $840 mil­lion in 2017 and $1 bil­lion in 2018. It is ex­pected to more than dou­ble over the next few years.</p>
    <p>Dr Re­becca Chan, a lec­turer from the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion’s Psy­chol­ogy and Child & Hu­man De­vel­op­ment aca­demic group, says the Gov­ern­ment’s in­volve­ment has helped the preschool sec­tor in sev­eral ways.</p>
    <p>The ECDA has led the sec­tor in pro­vid­ing qual­ity care and ed­u­ca­tion through the Sin­ga­pore Preschool Ac­cred­i­ta­tion Frame­work (Spark) re­quire­ments, she says, which serve as a guide for par­ents to iden­tify good pre-schools.</p>
    <p>There are more than 980 Sparkcer­ti­fied cen­tres now, up from 568 in 2016.</p>
    <p>“(The agency) has given a boost and clearer sense of the sec­tor’s ca­reer path­way, where op­por­tu­ni­ties are cre­ated to cater to dif­fer­ing as­pi­ra­tions, such as in­fant ed­u­carer, lead­er­ship and teach­ing roles,” says Dr Chan.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tors also now have greater sup­port in their pro­fes­sional de­vel­op­ment and train­ing through sub­sidised cour­ses and schol­ar­ships, she adds.</p>
    <p>With lower fees, fam­i­lies also ben­e­fit from bet­ter learn­ing fa­cil­i­ties, ser­vices and re­sources, while pur­pose-built mega pre-school cen­tres now cater to chil­dren’s de­vel­op­men­tal needs through in­door and out­door spa­ces.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, the fund­ing en­abled some or­gan­i­sa­tions to pro­vide ad­di­tional ser­vices like learn­ing sup­port teams to close the gap at an early stage of the kids’ lives, es­pe­cially in lan­guage and lit­er­acy learn­ing and de­vel­op­ment, crit­i­cal to read­ing and writ­ing later in for­mal school­ing,” Dr Chan says.</p>
    <p>She adds that gov­ern­ment fund­ing has sup­ported lower-in­come fam­i­lies, whose chil­dren can go on field trips or en­rich­ment pro­grammes that might not have been open to them in the past.</p>
    <p>But even with the state play­ing a greater role in the pre-school sec­tor, Dr Chan hopes that in­de­pen­dent and pri­vate-run pre-schools will be given due recog­ni­tion.</p>
    <p>“These pri­vate pre-schools, although small in size in com­par­i­son with newer pre-schools, pro­vide per­son­alised ser­vices cou­pled with trust­ing re­la­tion­ships built over the years and have a last­ing im­pact on chil­dren’s learn­ing and de­vel­op­ment too,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion is creative, in­no­va­tive, adapt­able and ex­per­i­men­tal in na­ture; we need choices and va­ri­eties to thrive,” she adds, not­ing that smaller preschools need the Gov­ern­ment’s help, too, to adapt to changes.</p>
