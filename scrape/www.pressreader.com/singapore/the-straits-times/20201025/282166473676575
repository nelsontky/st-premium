    <p>They had let a two-goal lead slip, but Al­birex Ni­igata found it within them­selves to con­jure up a 94thminute win­ner to beat fel­low Sin­ga­pore Premier League (SPL) con­tenders Lion City Sailors 3-2 yes­ter­day and surge to the top of the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the dra­matic fin­ish at the Jurong East Sta­dium was shrouded in con­tro­versy as Al­birex skip­per Kazuki Hash­ioka ap­peared to have con­trolled the ball with his hand be­fore set­ting up Reo Nishiguchi at the back post.</p>
    <p>In a sea­son short­ened from three rounds to two due to the coro­n­avirus pandemic, the big call could have a huge im­pact on the ti­tle race as the Sailors re­main sixth with four points from four games.</p>
    <p>Sailors coach Aure­lio Vid­mar, who vented his frus­tra­tions on the dugout af­ter the con­tentious goal, said post-match: “We are very un­lucky not to get some­thing out of this game...</p>
    <p>“It was hand­ball and it is very dis­ap­point­ing to lose like this. This is a strange and short sea­son and, with one mishap, it could be hard to catch up.”</p>
    <p>Sailors for­ward Gabriel Quak added: “The come­back was en­cour­ag­ing but we would pre­fer a scrappy win.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, the three points are what is most im­por­tant, we don’t want to just keep say­ing we put up a good fight.”</p>
    <p>Al­birex, cham­pi­ons from 2016 to 2018, started off brighter and grabbed a 19th-minute opener when Sailors goal­keeper Has­san Sunny could only palm Hiroyoshi Ka­mata’s cross for To­moyuki Doi to slot in. There was more sloppy de­fend­ing from the vis­i­tors when Ryosuke Na­ga­sawa seized onto Ta­jeli Sala­mat’s missed clear­ance and to score in the 36th minute.</p>
    <p>The Sailors missed in­jured play­maker Shah­dan Su­laiman as they lacked pace and cre­ativ­ity in mid­field, with striker Stipe Plaz­i­bat starved of qual­ity ser­vice.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they were re­ju­ve­nated af­ter the break.</p>
    <p>Hafiz Nor was set to be sub­sti­tuted but played a key role in start­ing the at­tack that led to Ar­shad Shamim head­ing on Plaz­i­bat’s cross, for Song Ui-young to pull one back in the 59th minute.</p>
    <p>The Sailors had more thrust with Quak’s in­tro­duc­tion 10 min­utes later and he smashed home the equaliser in the 88th minute.</p>
    <p>Against the run of play though, Nishiguchi scored for the fifth con­sec­u­tive game be­fore the team cel­e­brated in front of the fans who dot­ted the perime­ter of the sta­dium.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old said: “When it was 2-2, I looked at the clock and felt that with the many counter-at­tack­ing play­ers... we have a chance to get the win­ner. And we never gave up un­til the fi­nal whis­tle.”</p>
    <p>With the three points, Al­birex re­main un­beaten and move top with 11 points from five games.</p>
    <p>Al­birex coach Keiji Shige­tomi added: “I’m happy with how the team got the goal in added time, but we still have to work on prob­lem ar­eas like how we al­lowed the Sailors to dom­i­nate pos­ses­sion in the sec­ond half to score two goals.”</p>
    <p>In the other game, Balestier Khalsa beat Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional 3-2 at Our Tampines Hub to go sec­ond, level on points with Al­birex but with a poorer goal dif­fer­ence and hav­ing played a game more.</p>

The White Swans&#x2019; win&#xAD;ner came amid con&#xAD;tro&#xAD;versy, as their op&#xAD;po&#xAD;nents claimed there was a hand&#xAD;ball in the build-up to Nishiguchi&#x2019;s goal.</p>
