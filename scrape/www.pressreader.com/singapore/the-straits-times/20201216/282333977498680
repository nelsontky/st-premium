    <p>LON­DON McLaren are still years from clos­ing the gap to For­mula One cham­pi­ons Mercedes and run­ners-up Red Bull de­spite en­joy­ing their best sea­son since 2012, ac­cord­ing to team prin­ci­pal An­dreas Seidl.</p>
    <p>The former cham­pi­ons re­claimed third place over­all af­ter the Abu Dhabi sea­son-en­der last Sun­day.</p>
    <p>“We need to stay re­al­is­tic. De­spite the good re­sult we have this week­end and, de­spite the great out­come for us in the cham­pi­onship side with P3, I think we know ex­actly where we are,” Seidl said.</p>
    <p>“There’s still a huge gap to the cars in front, es­pe­cially the Mercedes.”</p>
    <p>Mercedes won both ti­tles for an un­prece­dented sev­enth year in a row, scor­ing 573 con­struc­tors’ points with seven-time world cham­pion Lewis Hamil­ton pro­vid­ing 347. McLaren had 202, be­hind Red Bull’s 319.</p>
    <p>McLaren have not won a race since 2012, Hamil­ton’s last sea­son with them, but have climbed back from ninth with Honda in 2017.</p>
    <p>“The team this year have pro­duced a very com­pet­i­tive car, a great step for­ward com­pared to last year,” added Seidl, who joined last year. “Still, we know what the gap to the Mercedes is. It is not some­thing we will close from one year to the next year. We still know that we have a lot of deficits within the team, in terms of or­gan­i­sa­tion, in terms of in­fra­struc­ture, which we need to close first.</p>
    <p>“It will take time. But I’m con­fi­dent that if we do the right things on the team side, we can close these gaps in some years.”</p>
    <p>Seidl ex­pected next year, with the cars largely the same be­fore ma­jor change in 2022, to be an­other bat­tle be­tween four or five teams for best of the rest be­hind the top two.</p>
    <p>McLaren have Aus­tralian Daniel Ric­cia­rdo, a race win­ner with Red Bull, join­ing from Re­nault to part­ner Bri­tain’s Lando Nor­ris af­ter Spa­niard Car­los Sainz leaves for Fer­rari.</p>
    <p>McLaren chief ex­ec­u­tive Zak</p>
    <p>Brown be­lieves that their driv­ers’ line-up next year will be the most ex­cit­ing in For­mula One.</p>
    <p>Nor­ris and Sainz fin­ished fifth and sixth in Abu Dhabi, which en­abled the team to secure an es­ti­mated ex­tra €5.5 mil­lion (S$8.9 mil­lion) in prize money af­ter climb­ing from fourth on a day when they also an­nounced a ma­jor in­vest­ment – re­ported to be around €200 mil­lion – from Amer­i­can con­sor­tium MSP Sports Cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“Lando has come off a great first year and is now re­ally com­ing of age and Daniel is a seven-time win­ner,” said Brown.</p>
    <p>“I think we have the most ex­cit­ing line-up in F1 next year.”</p>
