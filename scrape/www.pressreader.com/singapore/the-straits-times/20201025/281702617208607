    <p>• The num­ber of po­ten­tial Covid-19 deaths in the United States could drop by 130,000 if 95 per cent of Amer­i­cans would cover their faces, the Univer­sity of Wash­ing­ton’s In­sti­tute for Health Met­rics and Eval­u­a­tion (IHME) said.</p>
    <p>The pro­jec­tion echoed a rec­om­men­da­tion by top US in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert An­thony Fauci, who sug­gested it might be time to man­date masks in the US as in­fec­tion num­bers con­tinue to soar. “If peo­ple are not wear­ing masks, then maybe we should be man­dat­ing it,” he told CNN on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“There’s go­ing to be a dif­fi­culty en­forc­ing it, but if ev­ery­one agrees that this is some­thing that’s i mpor­tant and they man­date it and ev­ery­body pulls to­gether... I think that would be a great idea to have ev­ery­body do it uni­formly,” the di­rec­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases said.</p>
    <p>As win­ter ap­proaches, health ex­perts have raised con­cerns that the cooler weather will drive Amer­i­cans in­doors, where the coro­n­avirus is more likely to spread.</p>
    <p>That is why peo­ple need to “dou­ble down” on anti-virus mea­sures that work, Dr Fauci said. “Uni­ver­sal mask wear­ing” is one, he said, as is keep­ing a dis­tance from oth­ers and fre­quent hand-wash­ing.</p>
    <p>“They sound very sim­ple. But we’re not uni­formly do­ing that and that’s one of the rea­sons we’re see­ing th­ese surges,” he said.</p>
    <p>US Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar also at­trib­uted the in­crease in cases na­tion­wide to the be­hav­iour of in­di­vid­u­als, say­ing house­hold gath­er­ings have be­come a “ma­jor vec­tor of disease spread”.</p>
    <p>Asked about an as­ser­tion by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump dur­ing Thursday night’s pres­i­den­tial de­bate that the US is “round­ing the turn” on the pandemic, Mr Azar said Mr Trump was try­ing to give hope to Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>More than 84,000 peo­ple were di­ag­nosed with Covid-19 across the US on Fri­day, an­other record one-day in­crease in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The spike to 84,218 cases, break­ing the record of 77,299 set on July 16, comes as IHME re­searchers fore­cast that the US death toll from Covid-19 could reach a to­tal of 500,000 by Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>“We are head­ing into a very sub­stan­tial fall/win­ter surge,” said IHME di­rec­tor Chris Mur­ray, who co-led the research.</p>
    <p>Six­teen US states hit one­day records for new coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions on Fri­day, in­clud­ing five con­sid­ered key in the Nov 3 pres­i­den­tial elec­tion: Ohio, Michi­gan, North Carolina, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin.</p>
