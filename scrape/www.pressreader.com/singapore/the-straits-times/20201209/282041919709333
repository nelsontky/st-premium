    <p>The High Court has re­jected an ap­pli­ca­tion by lawyer and Peo­ples Voice po­lit­i­cal party leader Lim Tean for the po­lice to drop two in­ves­ti­ga­tions against him.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim had claimed the in­ves­ti­ga­tions were po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated and that the po­lice and Com­mer­cial Af­fairs Depart­ment (CAD) had col­luded against him.</p>
    <p>But yes­ter­day, Jus­tice Ang Cheng Hock said in a writ­ten judg­ment that he found no ev­i­dence to sup­port the claim.</p>
    <p>“At the con­clu­sion of the hear­ing, I dis­missed the plain­tiff’s ap­pli­ca­tion be­cause it was with­out any merit and I pro­vided par­ties with brief rea­sons for my de­ci­sion.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lim is be­ing in­ves­ti­gated by the CAD, the white-col­lar crime unit of the po­lice force, for sus­pected crim­i­nal breach of trust un­der the Pe­nal Code. He is ac­cused of mis­ap­pro­pri­at­ing $30,000 which he re­ceived from an in­sur­ance com­pany on be­half of a for­mer client for a mo­tor ac­ci­dent claim.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim is also be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for an al­leged of­fence of un­law­ful stalk­ing un­der the Pro­tec­tion from Ha­rass­ment Act (POHA). The com­plainant al­leged that he had in­vited her for din­ner and drinks at his home, and per­sis­tently ad­dressed her us­ing in­ap­pro­pri­ate</p>
    <p>terms such as “dar­ling” and “baby” even after she told him she felt un­com­fort­able with it.</p>
    <p>The Peo­ples Voice party chief was ar­rested in his of­fice on Oct 2, after he failed to co­op­er­ate with the po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>In his ap­pli­ca­tion on Oct 20, he sought to pro­hibit in­ves­ti­gat­ing of­fi­cer Han­nah Cheong of the po­lice’s Cen­tral Di­vi­sion from con­tin­u­ing the POHA in­ves­ti­ga­tions, as he claimed she was in “col­lu­sion” with CAD in­ves­ti­gat­ing of­fi­cer Des­mond Toh.</p>
    <p>The two of­fi­cers had made a phone call to him to­gether on Sept 23, ask­ing that he go to the CAD’s of­fice for an in­ter­view on the two sus­pected of­fences.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim also sought a manda­tory or­der against the two agen­cies to stop both in­ves­ti­ga­tions as “the en­tire process” is “ir­re­versibly tainted with bi­as­ness”, ac­cord­ing to the writ­ten judg­ment.</p>
    <p>Jus­tice Ang said the po­lice have a duty un­der the Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code to in­ves­ti­gate of­fences, and Mr Lim had failed to show that the po­lice had acted in bad faith or con­trary to the Con­sti­tu­tion. He also noted that Mr Lim’s claims of col­lu­sion be­tween the two in­ves­ti­ga­tors were “en­tirely un­clear”, apart from the “mere fact” that they made that phone call to­gether.</p>
    <p>He said Mr Lim had pro­vided noth­ing more than a bare as­ser­tion with­out any de­tails and sup­port­ing ev­i­dence, nor could his lawyer ex­plain what le­gal ef­fect the al­leged col­lu­sion had on the in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the two of­fi­cers ex­plained that they had planned to in­ter­view Mr Lim on the same date for con­ve­nience, since the CAD and Cen­tral Di­vi­sion are both lo­cated in the Po­lice Can­ton­ment Com­plex in New Bridge Road.</p>
    <p>While Mr Lim claimed that the in­ves­ti­ga­tions were “po­lit­i­cally mo­ti­vated”, he gave no ev­i­dence of that, noted Jus­tice Ang.</p>
    <p>The High Court judge also ad­dressed Mr Lim’s com­plaints that the po­lice re­ports are ei­ther un­true or un­founded, or that there is doubt about the cred­i­bil­ity of the com­plainant, say­ing it would pre­cisely be in his in­ter­est to for­mally pro­vide his state­ment to the two agen­cies to ex­plain his ver­sion of events.</p>
    <p>“If a per­son’s state­ment of in­no­cence or al­le­ga­tions of bad faith on the com­plainant’s part is enough to jus­tify the court or­der­ing a stop to po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions, it would make a mock­ery of the pow­ers and pro­ce­dures for crim­i­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tions set out in the CPC (Crim­i­nal Pro­ce­dure Code).”</p>
