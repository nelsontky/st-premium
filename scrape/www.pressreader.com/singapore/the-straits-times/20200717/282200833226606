    <p>The shares of glove mak­ers on the Sin­ga­pore bourse saw sharp sell-offs this week, af­ter a bullish run over the past six months, thanks to a boost in de­mand for gloves amid Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The United States Cus­toms and Bor­der Pro­tec­tion (CBP) is­sued a de­ten­tion or­der on Wed­nes­day on im­ports made by the world’s largest glove man­u­fac­turer, Top Glove, which is dual-listed in Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, the trio of rub­ber glove plays – Top Glove, UG Health­care and River­stone Hold­ings – all reg­is­tered price falls, al­beit to vary­ing de­grees.</p>
    <p>One an­a­lyst told The Busi­ness Times (BT) yes­ter­day that there seems to be a “very fierce trad­ing pat­tern” among the glove coun­ters.</p>
    <p>“A lot of op­ti­mism was priced in, prices ran up well ahead of val­u­a­tions and sub­se­quently cor­rected down.”</p>
    <p>In a reg­u­la­tory fil­ing yes­ter­day af­ter­noon, Top Glove dis­closed that the CBP has placed a de­ten­tion or­der on dis­pos­able gloves man­u­fac­tured by two of the com­pany’s sub­sidiaries – Top Glove Sdn Bhd and TG Med­i­cal Sdn Bhd.</p>
    <p>Such a move is in­tended to stop im­ports from com­pa­nies sus­pected of us­ing forced labour, Reuters re­ported.</p>
    <p>Top Glove said it is reach­ing out to the CBP through its of­fice in the US, as well as cus­tomers and con­sul­tants, to bet­ter un­der­stand the sit­u­a­tion and work to­wards a “speedy res­o­lu­tion” within an es­ti­mated two weeks.</p>
    <p>“There is a pos­si­bil­ity this may be re­lated to for­eign labour is­sues which we have al­ready re­solved, save for one more is­sue with re­gard to ret­ro­spec­tive pay­ment of re­cruit­ment fees by our work­ers to agents prior to Jan­uary 2019, with­out our knowl­edge.”</p>
    <p>The com­pany added that it has been bear­ing all re­cruit­ment fees since Jan­uary last year when its zero re­cruit­ment fee pol­icy was im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>“Over the past few months, we have been work­ing on this is­sue which in­volves ex­ten­sive trac­ing, to es­tab­lish the cor­rect amount to be paid back to our work­ers, on be­half of the pre­vi­ous agents.”</p>
    <p>Top Glove now es­ti­mates this amount to be about RM20 mil­lion (S$6.5 mil­lion) to RM50 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>So far this week, UG Health­care has tum­bled 21.8 per cent from July 13 to 15, while River­stone has fallen 5.8 per cent, ShareIn­vestor data shows. They were up 48.1 per cent and 17.7 per cent re­spec­tively last week from July 6 to 9.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Top Glove seems to be hold­ing on to its weekly gains, for now. The counter rose 6.1 per cent from July 13 to 15, af­ter ad­vanc­ing 14.7 per cent last week.</p>
    <p>Over the past six months, UG Health­care has gained al­most 800 per cent, Top Glove has risen some 366 per cent and River­stone has climbed over 220 per cent, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg data.</p>
    <p>The an­a­lyst BT spoke to high­lighted that some bro­ker­ages had im­posed trad­ing re­stric­tions on some of these stocks in re­cent days, af­ter a sharp run-up in prices.</p>
    <p>Asked about pos­si­ble rea­sons for the re­cent share price move­ments, he noted that the price falls come as mar­ket eu­pho­ria slows down.</p>
    <p>Al­go­rith­mic trad­ing could be a con­tribut­ing fac­tor, though “there is no way to at­tribute to it con­vinc­ingly”, he added.</p>
    <p>“There are var­i­ous al­go­rith­mic traders in the mar­ket cur­rently based on mar­ket feed­back. They tend to trade the liq­uid stocks ac­tively, and can add to the price swings.”</p>
