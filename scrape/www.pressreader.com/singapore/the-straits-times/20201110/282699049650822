    <p>To see the in­ter­nal work­ings of the 54m-tall Clock Tower at the Vic­to­ria Theatre and Con­cert Hall, you must climb 106 stairs and two cat lad­ders</p>
    <p>It is not ev­ery day in Sin­ga­pore that a 115-year-old grand dame in­vites one for a visit. So of course I jump at the chance to see the in­ter­nal work­ings of the 54m-tall Clock Tower at the Vic­to­ria Theatre and Con­cert Hall.</p>
    <p>I quail a lit­tle when I find out the climb in­cludes 106 steps plus two cat lad­ders. But on a quiet week­day morn­ing, I show up for a press tour, du­ti­fully togged out in com­fort­able sneak­ers and jeans as per the ad­vi­sory.</p>
    <p>This is the first time The Arts House Lim­ited, which man­ages the Old Par­lia­ment build­ing as well as the Vic­to­ria per­form­ing arts com­plex, has opened the tower to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>First, the caveat. The tour is avail­able only to peo­ple who sign up for Trafal­gar Tours’ Near Not Far stay­ca­tion pack­ages.</p>
    <p>Bun­dled into the pack­age is a two-day, one-night stay in ei­ther the Parkroyal on Beach Road ($528 a per­son) or the Capi­tol Kempin­ski Ho­tel ($628 a per­son); a Be My Guest ex­pe­ri­ence with cook­ing doyenne Vi­o­let Oon host­ing a meal at her National Kitchen restau­rant; and, fi­nally, the Sin­ga­pore Her­itage High­lights tour led by his­tory buff and blog­ger Jerome Lim.</p>
    <p>The ap­prox­i­mately two-hour tour takes in the Old Par­lia­ment build­ing and the Vic­to­ria build­ings. Mr Lim is a ver­i­ta­ble fount of in­for­ma­tion, spout­ing names and dates at the drop of a hat, so the tour is lit­er­ally a walk through his­tory.</p>
    <p>I get a re­fresher on all the de­tails about the Old Par­lia­ment build­ing.</p>
    <p>Built in 1827, it was orig­i­nally de­signed by Ge­orge Cole­man as a home for Scots­man John Ar­gyle Maxwell. But the land was gazetted for gov­ern­ment use, so the Bri­tish ad­min­is­tra­tion took over the build­ing and, since then, it has served as ad­min­is­tra­tive of­fices, the Supreme Court and, of course, in­de­pen­dent Sin­ga­pore’s first Par­lia­ment build­ing.</p>
    <p>I have to con­fess I have never no­ticed the tiny cup­board tucked un­der the stairs de­spite many vis­its to the Arts House over the years. This was the first of­fice given by the Bri­tish to Sin­ga­pore’s first chief min­is­ter David Mar­shall.</p>
    <p>The tour also gives a peek at what used to be the of­fice for the Speaker of Par­lia­ment – a room with a nice view of the river, which now serves as a back­stage area for the stage in the Cham­ber.</p>
    <p>The Vic­to­ria Theatre and Con­cert Hall are of more re­cent vin­tages.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria Hall was built as a town hall in 1862 and con­verted into a theatre af­ter the Vic­to­ria Me­mo­rial Hall, also known as the Con­cert Hall, was built in 1905 in me­mory of Queen Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>There are fun facts here such as the tid­bit that com­poser Zu­bir Said’s Ma­ju­lah Sin­ga­pura de­buted at the Vic­to­ria Theatre in 1958, be­fore Sin­ga­pore gained its in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>But th­ese are ap­pe­tis­ers to the main course, at least for me.</p>
    <p>The tour’s cli­max is the climb up the clock tower. The good news: You start on the third floor, so it is not a 199-step slog like it once was for the clock’s long-time re­pair­man, Mr P.K. Chan.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, you have to be pre­pared to climb 106 stairs (yes, I counted), which is the easy part.</p>
    <p>The bad news: To reach the top of the tower, there are two cat lad­ders, the last one of­fer­ing a steep as­cent through a nar­row trap­door.</p>
    <p>This is where I ap­pre­ci­ated the com­pul­sory hard hat, good shel­ter against stolid beams and the safety brief­ing which em­pha­sises a three­p­oint con­tact with the steps at all times.</p>
    <p>The re­ward for the climb is a close-up look at the clock and chimes, do­nated by the Straits Trad­ing Com­pany.</p>
    <p>The en­tire mech­a­nism is run by grav­ity in the way an old-school grand­fa­ther clock works, with coun­ter­weights and a pen­du­lum. The weights used to be cranked up man­u­ally by Mr Chan un­til a me­chan­i­cal sys­tem was in­stalled in 2010.</p>
    <p>Hear­ing the quar­ter hour chimes, in the clas­sic Big Ben style, gives me a child­ishly glee­ful thrill, es­pe­cially since I get to see the bells be­ing struck.</p>
    <p>Watch out, though, if you are up there on the hour chime as the big­gest bell, which weighs about two tonnes, might of­fer a ring­ing shock at close quar­ters.</p>
    <p>Not be­ing a fan of heights or lad­ders, I find the de­scent a chal­lenge. But a slow and steady pace gets me down with all limbs in­tact. Not ex­actly a tow­er­ing achieve­ment, but it feels like a mi­nor vic­tory.</p>
    <p>The steadily swing­ing pen­du­lum and stately bells are also some­how re­as­sur­ing in their im­pla­ca­ble time­keep­ing.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is but the blink of an eye in the span of Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory. It, too, shall pass. And the clock ticks on.</p>
