    <p>On In­ter­na­tional Friend­ship Day to­day, Sin­ga­pore cel­e­brates the 250th birth anniversar­y of com­poser Lud­wig van Beethoven with a dig­i­tal per­for­mance of his 9th Sym­phony, known for its renowned Ode To Joy.</p>
    <p>The clas­si­cal world had orig­i­nally made plans to cel­e­brate Beethoven’s 250th birth­day in a big way. In Sin­ga­pore, we had planned to as­sem­ble a spe­cial orches­tra made up of in­ter­na­tional mu­si­cians to per­form the 9th Sym­phony and to move from the iconic Botanic Gar­dens, the “home” of our open-air Beethoven im Garten se­ries, to the Es­planade Con­cert Hall. Due to Covid-19, we had to change our plans, and, in the spirit of Beethoven, not to give up.</p>
    <p>We have brought to­gether more than 1,000 mu­si­cians to present Ode To Joy, to­day Europe’s “na­tional” an­them, with a ground-break­ing, never-be­fore-seen, 360-de­gree con­struc­tion that is op­ti­mised for view­ing on smart­phones, tablets and com­put­ers. To view it, tune in to The Straits Times’ Face­book or YouTube chan­nel to­day at 8pm.</p>
    <p>These per­form­ers con­sist of in­di­vid­u­als from top in­sti­tu­tions such as the Ber­lin Konz­erthaus Orches­tra, Chicago Sym­phony, Dres­den Kreuz­chor Boys’ Choir, Hong Kong Phil­har­monic, Ja­pan Phil­har­monic, Min­nesota Orches­tra, New York Phil­har­monic, Nurem­berg Sym­phony, Phil­har­monic Cho­rus of Tokyo and Royal Liver­pool</p>
    <p>Phil­har­monic, play­ing along­side the next gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­porean mu­si­cians as young as 10 years old.</p>
    <p>An in­ter­na­tional sin­ga­long cam­paign has en­abled us to in­vite sub­mis­sions from a num­ber of renowned non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>So who was Beethoven, this mu­si­cian who brings peo­ple around the world to­gether 250 years af­ter his birth?</p>
    <p>ONLY ONE BEETHOVEN</p>
    <p>Beethoven (1770-1827) was born in what has come to be known as the Clas­si­cal pe­riod, when it was still com­mon for com­posers and mu­si­cians to be treated as ser­vants by aris­to­crats. Both his men­tors, Mozart and Haydn, were court mu­si­cians and they had to of­ten com­pose for the peo­ple who paid for their ser­vices.</p>
    <p>But Beethoven was dif­fer­ent. In a let­ter to Prince Lich­nowsky, one of his most sup­port­ive pa­trons, he wrote: “Prince, what you are, you are by ac­ci­dent of birth; what I am, I am of my­self. There are and will be thou­sands of princes. There is only one Beethoven.”</p>
    <p>He stood at the be­gin­ning of the democrati­sa­tion of art, and in­spired the start of a mu­si­cal move­ment called Ro­man­ti­cism, which lasted al­most a cen­tury.</p>
    <p>Beethoven pushed mu­si­cal bound­aries and wrote longer, more dis­so­nant, more com­plex works than any­one be­fore him. He ex­panded his orches­tra and added in­stru­ments such as the pic­colo and the con­tra­bas­soon, as well as the con­cept of march­ing per­cus­sion, with in­stru­ments de­signed to be played on the move. Un­til then, this was seen only in terms of an out­door mil­i­tary band and had no place in the con­cert hall.</p>
    <p>Most im­por­tantly, his mu­sic has with­stood the test of time to be­come iconic tunes known world­wide. Many would recog­nise the Ode To Joy melody, or the be­gin­ning to the 5th Sym­phony (da-da-da-dum), whether mu­si­cally trained or not. What he started so pow­er­fully “out of the box”, to­day unites peo­ple around the world.</p>
    <p>Beethoven’s life was in­cred­i­bly colour­ful. He was born into a pe­riod of feu­dal­ism, with the cas­tle of Cologne (known as the Elec­toral Palace) just around the cor­ner of his birth house in the Rhein­gasse in Bonn. Vi­enna, his city of choice later on, was still part of the “Holy Ro­man Em­pire” at the time, ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the hor­ri­fy­ing wars that fol­lowed the French Rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>In his early 30s, Beethoven dis­cov­ered he was turn­ing deaf, a cruel des­tiny for a mu­si­cian who re­lied on his hear­ing, and con­tem­plated sui­cide. The warm bond­ing of fam­ily was always out of reach for Beethoven – his fa­ther was a stern dis­ci­plinar­ian – and he em­barked on a se­ries of dif­fi­cult ro­man­tic re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>De­spite all these tragedies, Beethoven’s de­vo­tion to his art kept him alive, and gave him a hu­man fragility, strength and spir­i­tu­al­ity that tran­scended time and space. Be­cause of this, his mu­sic has seen hu­man­ity through the gravest pe­ri­ods of his­tory – world wars, the fall of the Ber­lin Wall, Tianan­men, and now Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Beethoven was a revo­lu­tion­ary who found a way to ex­press his deep-seated emo­tions of democ­racy in a peace­ful fash­ion, not through the vi­o­lent means of the com­man­ders of his time, but through his pen and manuscript.</p>
    <p>LONG-TERM LEGACY</p>
    <p>Ger­many to­day has a mul­ti­tude of con­cert halls and is home to roughly 130 or­ches­tras. The largest por­tion of pub­lic cul­tural fund­ing goes into mu­sic. These are long-term ef­fects of Beethoven’s sin­gu­lar charisma that can only be ex­plained by the en­ergy, con­cise­ness, ac­ces­si­bil­ity and the abil­ity to touch peo­ple’s hearts.</p>
    <p>Just one ex­am­ple: Dur­ing World War I, Ger­man pris­on­ers of war jointly per­formed Beethoven’s</p>
    <p>9th Sym­phony for the first time in Tokushima pre­fec­ture in Ja­pan. Since then, Daiku (No. 9) con­certs are now staged ev­ery year in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>As for tonight’s world­wide per­for­mance con­vened by one of the writ­ers of this piece, Sin­ga­porean Wong Kah Chun, what we wanted to achieve on this very spe­cial oc­ca­sion was an in­ter­na­tional “kam­pung”, a place where warmth and to­geth­er­ness count in­stead of na­tion­al­ism and pro­tec­tion­ism.</p>
    <p>One of the many things to learn from the pan­demic is to re­main hum­ble, to not claim supremacy as a con­cept, to search for that equi­lib­rium be­tween na­ture and mankind that alone can help us move for­ward.</p>
    <p>Through the won­der­ful force of Beethoven’s mu­sic, we are united as one.</p>
    <p>His mu­sic brings peo­ple to­gether with­out any lan­guage bar­rier. Beethoven’s Ode To Joy speaks of uni­ver­sal brother­hood and a wish for peace and free­dom. In our project, we con­nect the con­trasts of East and West, tra­di­tion and in­no­va­tion, di­ver­sity and in­clu­sion. In many ways, doesn’t this also tell the story of Sin­ga­pore?</p>
