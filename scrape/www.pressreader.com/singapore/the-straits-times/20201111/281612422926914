    <p>LON­DON • An 80 per cent up­take of a Covid-19 vac­cine may be needed to pro­tect com­mu­ni­ties from the novel coro­n­avirus, but volatile lev­els of mis­in­for­ma­tion and vac­cine mis­trust could un­der­mine ef­forts to tackle the pan­demic, Bri­tish sci­en­tists said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A re­port by sci­en­tific in­sti­tu­tions the Bri­tish Academy and the Royal So­ci­ety found that, in part due to cir­cu­lat­ing mis­in­for­ma­tion and be­havioural fac­tors, around 36 per cent of peo­ple in Bri­tain say they are ei­ther un­cer­tain or very un­likely to agree to be vac­ci­nated against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It said an “open di­a­logue” is crit­i­cal to build­ing pub­lic sup­port for Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion, and called for a “frank con­ver­sa­tion” to man­age pub­lic ex­pec­ta­tions that life will not im­me­di­ately get back to nor­mal when vac­cines ar­rive.</p>
    <p>“Vac­cines and vac­ci­na­tion are two very dif­fer­ent things. To achieve the es­ti­mated 80 per cent of up­take of a vac­cine re­quired for com­mu­nity pro­tec­tion, we need a se­ri­ous, well-funded and com­mu­nity-based pub­lic en­gage­ment strat­egy,” said Dr Melinda Mills an ex­pert in de­mo­graphic sci­ence who led the re­port.</p>
    <p>Opin­ion polls done be­fore and dur­ing the pan­demic show that con­fi­dence in vac­cines is volatile, and that po­lit­i­cal po­lar­i­sa­tion and on­line mis­in­for­ma­tion are likely to af­fect up­take rates. “We must learn from lessons of his­tory and move away from the one-way pro­vi­sion of in­for­ma­tion and in­stead gen­er­ate an open di­a­logue that ad­dresses mis­in­for­ma­tion and does not dis­miss peo­ple’s real vac­cine con­cerns and hes­i­tancy,” Dr Mills said.</p>
    <p>The re­port also said govern­ments should plan for a “phased and eth­i­cal” vac­cine de­ploy­ment based on trans­par­ent prin­ci­ples that are “suf­fi­ciently de­bated with the pub­lic to build un­der­stand­ing”.</p>
    <p>It rec­om­mended that pri­or­ity groups in­clude those in high-risk oc­cu­pa­tions like health­care work­ers and bus driv­ers, and vul­ner­a­ble groups in crowded ar­eas, like the home­less and peo­ple in pris­ons.</p>
