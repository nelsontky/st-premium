    <p>Jakarta Gover­nor Anies Baswedan yes­ter­day said that strict re­stric­tive mea­sures would be reim­posed in the In­done­sian cap­i­tal as Covid-19 cases con­tinue to surge.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence late in the day, he said large-scale so­cial re­stric­tions, which had grad­u­ally been eased since June 4, would be tight­ened again.</p>
    <p>The eas­ing of mea­sures had led to, among other things, the re­open­ing of busi­nesses and work­places, as well as parks and tourist des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>“We are now in an emer­gency sit­u­a­tion, on a greater scale than we were in the ear­lier phase of the out­break. Do not leave home if it’s not es­sen­tial. Do not leave Jakarta if there is no ur­gent pur­pose,” Mr Anies said via a live-stream­ing video on Face­book.</p>
    <p>“We are forced to reim­pose the PSBB (semi-lock­downs) as we did at the on­set of the pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Mr Anies did not say when the re­stric­tions would re­turn, but an­nounced that em­ploy­ees in non-es­sen­tial sec­tors would have to go back to work­ing from home from Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“Busi­nesses may con­tinue to op­er­ate, but the ac­tiv­i­ties in the of­fices must stop for now.”</p>
    <p>Mr Anies added that all en­ter­tain­ment cen­tres man­aged by the Jakarta city ad­min­is­tra­tion would be closed. Restau­rants and cafes may re­main open, but cus­tomers would not be al­lowed to dine in.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers will be re­stricted from en­ter­ing and leav­ing Greater Jakarta.</p>
    <p>He said the gov­ern­ment would pro­vide as­sis­tance to those in need.</p>
    <p>A city of 10 mil­lion, Jakarta has the du­bi­ous dis­tinc­tion of be­ing the first epi­cen­tre of the Covid-19 out­break in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>It re­ported 1,004 fresh cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of cases in the city to 49,397. The cap­i­tal also re­ported 17 new deaths, bring­ing to­tal fa­tal­i­ties to 1,334.</p>
    <p>The coun­try as a whole re­ported 203,342 cases and 8,336 deaths as at yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The death toll in In­done­sia is the high­est in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Mr Anies said that the health­care sec­tor was find­ing it dif­fi­cult to cope even though the gov­ern­ment had moved to in­crease the num­ber of beds and in­ten­sive care units (ICUs) in hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>The oc­cu­pancy rate of iso­la­tion rooms at the city’s 67 Covid-19 re­fer­ral hos­pi­tals has reached 77 per cent, and the rate for ICUs has hit 83 per cent, the city’s ad­min­is­tra­tion re­vealed ear­lier this week.</p>
    <p>Reuters, quot­ing ex­perts from Sin­ga­pore’s Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, re­ported that hos­pi­tals in Jakarta could reach full ca­pac­ity this month if stricter mea­sures are not im­posed. They fore­cast that the death toll in Jakarta could reach 3,000 by next month.</p>
    <p>Mr Anies said: “Faced with the emer­gency sit­u­a­tion, Jakarta doesn’t have any choice other than pulling the emer­gency brake as soon as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Once again, this is to save Jakarta res­i­dents. If the sit­u­a­tion is not con­trolled, hos­pi­tals will not be able to ac­com­mo­date (pa­tients) and this will lead to a higher num­ber of deaths in Jakarta.”</p>
