    <p>Divers Mark and Ti­mothy Lee thought they would be re­tired by now. But, with the Olympic Games post­poned be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the twins are still plug­ging away.</p>
    <p>De­spite the “big smack” to their plans, Tokyo re­mains in their sights af­ter qual­i­fy­ing for next year’s SEA Games in Hanoi at the 11th Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Div­ing Cham­pi­onships yes­ter­day. Mark, 26, scored 354.55 points in the Open 3m spring­board at the OCBC Aquatic Cen­tre to beat the qual­i­fy­ing score (325.50) and win ahead of Ti­mothy (332.90).</p>
    <p>But Ti­mothy said there are still things to im­prove on ahead of April’s Fina Div­ing World Cup, a qual­i­fy­ing meet for the July 23-Aug 8 Olympics. He es­ti­mates that a score of 380 is needed to reach the top 18 at the World Cup and qual­ify.</p>
    <p>He said: “I felt some of my dives could’ve been bet­ter... I have to work on sta­bil­is­ing my men­tal process as I go into com­pe­ti­tions.”</p>
    <p>The twins will also have to jug­gle train­ing and school – Ti­mothy is a fi­nal-year me­chan­i­cal engi­neer­ing un­der­grad­u­ate at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, while Mark is study­ing busi­ness at the Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity. While Ti­mothy will grad­u­ate in May, Mark has ex­tended his stud­ies by a year and will grad­u­ate in 2022 in­stead.</p>
    <p>“It was quite a big smack to our plans be­cause Mark and I are plan­ners,” said Ti­mothy, who has now pen­cilled the Nov 21-Dec 2 SEA Games as their swan­song. “We ar­ranged our mod­ules in prepa­ra­tion of the Olympics... so a lot of ad­just­ments had to be made.</p>
    <p>“We still want to go to the Olympics, so we’ve done what’s needed to be done to help us be at our best when the qual­i­fy­ing pe­riod comes.”</p>
    <p>Tokyo-bound Jonathan Chan and part­ner Max Lee scored 296.64 in the men’s 10m syn­chro­nised plat­form. They were the only com­peti­tors in their event.</p>
    <p>Chan, the first Sin­ga­porean diver to qual­ify for the Olympics, felt the com­pe­ti­tion was a good warm-up for big­ger meets next year.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old said af­ter his first com­pe­ti­tion since the Fina Div­ing Grand Prix in Novem­ber last year: “What I’ll be work­ing on now is con­sis­tency of my dives. Be­cause even if you train ev­ery day, some­times things just go hay­wire and you get a bad dive on com­pe­ti­tion day.”</p>
    <p>In the women’s Open 3m spring­board, Ash­lee Tan, 20, also qual­i­fied for the SEA Games with 242.05, just above the 241.25 needed. Fong Kay Yian (220.50) and Mira De­wan (190.80) fin­ished be­hind Tan, who made her SEA Games de­but in 2015.</p>
