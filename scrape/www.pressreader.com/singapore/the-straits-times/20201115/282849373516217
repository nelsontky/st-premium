    <p>It is a huge week in the 2021-22 Cham­pi­ons League. The big An­glo-Ital­ian clash pits Southamp­ton against Sas­suolo. It is the cham­pi­ons of Spain against their English coun­ter­parts as Real So­ciedad host Le­ices­ter. Mean­while, Ju­ven­tus are pre­par­ing for their Europa League clash with Cadiz.</p>
    <p>But Barcelona and the Manch­ester clubs, none of whom qual­i­fied for any con­ti­nen­tal com­pe­ti­tion, have a free mid­week.</p>
    <p>It is the stuff of fic­tion. It is nev­er­the­less fea­si­ble if league ta­bles re­main the same. They won’t, of course, and some of the au­tumn front run­ners will prove to be early-sea­son anom­alies who fade away.</p>
    <p>But the big­ger is­sue is the strug­gles of the su­per clubs. Some­times they have been one-off oc­cur­rences, al­most freak re­sults, oth­ers part of a broader trend.</p>
    <p>Liver­pool and Manch­ester</p>
    <p>United have both lost by five goals, Manch­ester City, Bay­ern Mu­nich and Real Madrid by three.</p>
    <p>Even Paris Saint-Ger­main started the sea­son with suc­ces­sive de­feats.</p>
    <p>But they and Bay­ern re­main top of their re­spec­tive leagues, and while nor­mal ser­vice has re­sumed in France and Ger­many, it has not in Eng­land, Italy and Spain.</p>
    <p>Some of the usual favourites are floun­der­ing. Very dif­fer­ent fac­tors have com­bined to add un­pre­dictabil­ity. Covid-19 has had a di­rect and an in­di­rect ef­fect. Liver­pool’s 7-2 thrash­ing at As­ton Villa came when Thi­ago Al­can­tara and Sa­dio Mane were self-iso­lat­ing, for in­stance, while PSG’s un­char­ac­ter­is­tic open­ing came when they had a host of cases.</p>
    <p>The de­layed end to the last cam­paign, es­pe­cially for those in Euro­pean ac­tion in Au­gust, has af­fected English, Span­ish and Ital­ian teams, who had the short­est break.</p>
    <p>Shorn of a proper pre-sea­son, United looked slug­gish and poor at the back when they re­turned. City have lacked at­tack­ing flu­ency. An­to­nio Conte, one of the most tac­ti­cally rig­or­ous train­ing ground man­agers, has not had time to drill In­ter Mi­lan.</p>
    <p>Then there is a com­pressed fix­ture list that of­fers no respite to the elite. They are un­ac­cus­tomed to two blocks of three Euro­pean games in suc­ces­sive mid­weeks. Fa­tigue is more of a fac­tor than for Southamp­ton, Sas­suolo and So­ciedad, play­ing only at week­ends.</p>
    <p>Pre­mier League man­agers have com­plained they are un­able to make five sub­sti­tutes, but in­vari­ably those with su­per­sized squads are not ro­tat­ing as much as</p>
    <p>The de­layed end to the last cam­paign, es­pe­cially for those in Euro­pean ac­tion in Au­gust, has af­fected English, Span­ish and Ital­ian teams, who had the short­est break.</p>
    <p>they can. Mean­while, mus­cle in­juries pile up with key play­ers, of­ten the most over­worked, then be­com­ing the most sus­cep­ti­ble in a vi­cious cir­cle.</p>
    <p>Es­pe­cially as a fi­nan­cial cri­sis has meant most have had to com­pro­mise in the trans­fer mar­ket. Vir­tu­ally ev­ery ma­jor club is at least one player short. That de­fi­ciency is most ap­par­ent at Real and Barcelona, who are pay­ing the price for past overspendi­ng and, es­pe­cially at the Nou Camp, bad buy­ing.</p>
    <p>There is a greater is­sue of de­cline at Spain’s dom­i­nant du­op­oly. And Ron­ald Koe­man feels a symp­tom and cause. At a time when man­agers are be­ing tested like never be­fore, how many in the plum jobs – such as An­drea Pirlo or Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer – are re­ally among the planet’s finest?</p>
    <p>So a hor­ri­bly im­per­fect sea­son could cre­ate a per­fect storm for some­one. The out­siders may never have a bet­ter chance to dis­place the su­per­pow­ers. A shock­ing year could pro­duce sur­prises.</p>
