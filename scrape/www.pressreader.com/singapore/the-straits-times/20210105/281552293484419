    <p>Sci­en­tists are locked in a heated de­bate over a sur­pris­ing ques­tion on Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion: Is it wis­est to hold back the sec­ond dose ev­ery­one will need, and in­stead give as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble an in­oc­u­la­tion now? Bri­tain has al­ready elected to de­lay the sec­ond dose as a way of widely dis­tribut­ing the par­tial pro­tec­tion from a sin­gle shot.</p>
    <p>NEW YORK • As govern­ments around the world rush to vac­ci­nate their cit­i­zens against the surg­ing coro­n­avirus, sci­en­tists are locked in a heated de­bate over a ques­tion: Is it wis­est to hold back the sec­ond dose ev­ery­one will need, and in­stead give as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble an in­oc­u­la­tion now?</p>
    <p>Since even the first shot ap­pears to pro­vide some pro­tec­tion against Covid-19, some ex­perts believe that the short­est route to con­tain­ing the virus is to dis­sem­i­nate the ini­tial in­jec­tions as widely as pos­si­ble now.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials in Bri­tain have al­ready elected to de­lay the sec­ond doses of vac­cines made by the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies As­traZeneca and Pfizer as a way of more widely dis­tribut­ing the par­tial pro­tec­tion af­forded by a sin­gle shot.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials in the United States have been adamantly op­posed to the idea.</p>
    <p>“I would not be in favour of that,” Dr An­thony Fauci, the na­tion’s top in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert, told CNN on Fri­day. “We’re go­ing to keep do­ing what we’re do­ing.”</p>
    <p>But on Sun­day, Dr Mon­cef Slaoui, sci­en­tific ad­viser of Oper­a­tion Warp Speed, the US fed­eral ef­fort to ac­cel­er­ate vac­cine de­vel­op­ment and dis­tri­bu­tion, of­fered an in­trigu­ing al­ter­na­tive: giv­ing some Amer­i­cans two half doses of the Moderna vac­cine, a way to pos­si­bly milk more im­mu­nity from the na­tion’s lim­ited vac­cine sup­ply.</p>
    <p>The ris­ing de­bate re­flects na­tion­wide frus­tra­tion that so few Amer­i­cans have got the first doses – far be­low the num­ber the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion had hoped would be in­oc­u­lated by the end of 2020.</p>
    <p>But the con­tro­versy it­self car­ries risks in a coun­try where health mea­sures have been politi­cised and many re­main hes­i­tant to take the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“Even the ap­pear­ance of tin­ker­ing has neg­a­tives, in terms of peo­ple hav­ing trust in the process,” said Dr Natalie Dean, a bio­statis­ti­cian at the Univer­sity of Florida.</p>
    <p>The vac­cines au­tho­rised so far in the US are pro­duced by Pfizer/ BioN­Tech and Moderna. Bri­tain has green­lit the Pfizer/BioN­Tech and Ox­ford/As­traZeneca vac­cines.</p>
    <p>All of them are in­tended to be de­liv­ered in mul­ti­ple doses on a strict sched­ule, re­ly­ing on a tiered pro­tec­tion strat­egy. The first in­jec­tion teaches the im­mune sys­tem to recog­nise a new pathogen by show­ing it a harm­less ver­sion of some of the virus’ most salient fea­tures.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the body has had time to “study” this ma­te­rial, as it were, a sec­ond shot presents these fea­tures again, help­ing im­mune cells com­mit the l es­son to mem­ory. These sub­se­quent doses are in­tended to in­crease the po­tency and dura­bil­ity of im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Clin­i­cal tri­als run by Pfizer/BioN­Tech and Moderna showed the vac­cines were highly ef­fec­tive at pre­vent­ing cases of Covid-19 when de­liv­ered in two doses sep­a­rated by three or four weeks.</p>
    <p>Some pro­tec­tion ap­pears to kick in af­ter the first shot of vac­cine, al­though it is un­clear how quickly it might wane. Still, some ex­perts now ar­gue that spread­ing vac­cines more thinly across a pop­u­la­tion by con­cen­trat­ing on first doses might save more lives than mak­ing sure half as many in­di­vid­u­als re­ceive both doses on sched­ule.</p>
    <p>That would be a re­mark­able de­par­ture from the orig­i­nal plan. Since the vac­cine roll-out be­gan last month in the US, sec­ond shots of the vac­cines have been held back to guar­an­tee that they will be avail­able on sched­ule for peo­ple who have al­ready got their first in­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>But in Bri­tain, doc­tors have been told to post­pone ap­point­ments for sec­ond doses that had been sched­uled for this month, so that those doses can be given in­stead as first shots to other pa­tients.</p>
    <p>But some re­searchers fear the de­layed-dose ap­proach could prove dis­as­trous, par­tic­u­larly in the US, where vac­cine roll-outs are al­ready stymied by lo­gis­ti­cal hur­dles and a patch­work ap­proach to pri­ori­tis­ing who gets the first jabs.</p>
    <p>“We have an is­sue with dis­tri­bu­tion, not the num­ber of doses,” said Dr Saad Omer, a vac­cine ex­pert at Yale Univer­sity. “Dou­bling the num­ber of doses doesn’t dou­ble your ca­pac­ity to give doses.”</p>
    <p>Dr Sh­weta Bansal, a math­e­mat­i­cal bi­ol­o­gist at Ge­orge­town Univer­sity, and oth­ers also raised con­cerns about the so­cial and psy­cho­log­i­cal ef­fects of de­lay­ing sec­ond doses.</p>
    <p>“The l onger the du­ra­tion be­tween doses, the more likely peo­ple are to for­get to come back,” she said. “Or peo­ple may not re­mem­ber which vac­cine they got, and we don’t know what a mix and match might do.”</p>
