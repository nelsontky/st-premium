    <p>I re­fer to Fo­rum con­trib­u­tor Ee Teck Siew’s let­ter (Govt should as­sess risk of prop­erty bub­ble, cal­i­brate mea­sures,</p>
    <p>Dec 25) and would like to urge the Gov­ern­ment to stay ahead of the curve on pri­vate prop­erty prices.</p>
    <p>The ul­tra-low in­ter­est rate en­vi­ron­ment to­day is sim­i­lar to that which sparked the pri­vate prop­erty price spike af­ter the 2008 fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>This proved chal­leng­ing to bring un­der con­trol and re­quired mul­ti­ple rounds of prop­erty cool­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>From the in­tro­duc­tion of the first prop­erty cool­ing mea­sures in 2009 un­til the in­tro­duc­tion of the to­tal debt ser­vic­ing ra­tio in 2013, it took four years of hard work by the Gov­ern­ment be­fore the pri­vate res­i­den­tial prop­erty mar­ket sta­bilised and prices started to mod­er­ate.</p>
    <p>Un­for­tu­nately, all this good work be­came rapidly un­done with the start of the en bloc craze in 2017, and even now, amid the pan­demic, prices in the pri­vate res­i­den­tial prop­erty mar­ket are con­tin­u­ing to rise.</p>
    <p>While the Gov­ern­ment has been cau­tious with the re­lease of res­i­den­tial land through gov­ern­ment land sales, spec­u­la­tion on a re­newed col­lec­tive sale cy­cle this year has started to arise.</p>
    <p>The previous col­lec­tive sale frenzy was not ben­e­fi­cial for Sin­ga­pore. De­vel­op­ments like The Gaza­nia and Trea­sure at Tampines more than tripled the num­ber of units built on the same plot of land. At the same time, a ma­jor­ity of these units are smaller than a Hous­ing Board four-room flat, and are be­ing of­fered at very high per-square-foot prices.</p>
    <p>This low­ers the qual­ity of life for Sin­ga­pore­ans as it forces peo­ple into in­creas­ingly smaller, less live­able apart­ments at higher prices.</p>
    <p>Given that past ex­pe­ri­ence shows prop­erty cool­ing mea­sures take time to have an im­pact, the Gov­ern­ment should take prompt ac­tion to pre­vent prop­erty prices from ris­ing ahead of eco­nomic fun­da­men­tals.</p>
    <p>These could in­clude in­creas­ing gov­ern­ment land sales, rais­ing ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty rates for for­eign pur­chasers and in­vestors, in­tro­duc­ing a va­cancy tax on prop­er­ties left va­cant for more than six months, rais­ing prop­erty taxes on non-owner-oc­cu­pied prop­erty and re­strict­ing Covid-19 mort­gage re­lief mea­sures to only owner-oc­cu­pied prop­er­ties.</p>
