    <p>He called New York home for six years. But that part of Mr Aaron Kho’s life came to an end when the Covid-19 pan­demic hit the United States ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The 27-year-old Sin­ga­porean was laid off in March. He had been a qual­ity man­ager at a fash­ion-re­lated e-com­merce firm for more than two years.</p>
    <p>“Early that month, we no­ticed that work wasn’t com­ing in and things es­ca­lated quickly,” said Mr Kho, who was one of three peo­ple laid off at the firm’s Amer­i­can of­fice.</p>
    <p>“It was a mad scram­ble as New York quickly be­came one of the epi­cen­tres of the pan­demic. Many peo­ple were flee­ing to their home coun­tries. I de­cided that Sin­ga­pore was the place I wanted to be as I felt it was safer.”</p>
    <p>Mr Kho did not think he would be able to find a new job at that time, as most com­pa­nies would be look­ing to cut costs. Over a pe­riod of 11 days, he packed his life into three suit­cases, set­tled his rental agree­ments and flew back to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“I would have wanted to stay in the US for a few more months if the pan­demic hadn’t hap­pen,” he said.</p>
    <p>Out of a job and with the pan­demic in full swing, Mr Kho was at first filled with anx­i­ety.</p>
    <p>But in the fol­low­ing weeks, a “strange kind of ex­cite­ment” came over him as he de­cided to rekin­dle his pas­sions and pur­sue pho­tog­ra­phy and film-mak­ing full time in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“This is what I’ve al­ways wanted to do. But when I grad­u­ated in 2017, I chose se­cu­rity and de­cided to try to earn money first,” said Mr Kho, who has been liv­ing with his par­ents and younger brother since he came back in March.</p>
    <p>One of the first projects he worked on since re­turn­ing in­volved doc­u­ment­ing his re­cent ex­pe­ri­ence.He made a 60-minute fea­ture film, ti­tled Parachute, de­tail­ing his re­lo­ca­tion amid the coro­n­avirus out­break and the days he spent un­der quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>He has sub­mit­ted it to the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Film Festival, which will be held later this year.</p>
    <p>Mr Kho said: “The pan­demic has been a damp­ener for ev­ery­one, but at the same time, it has also forced us to re­align our­selves with what is im­por­tant. I hope to re­main here for the fore­see­able fu­ture and see where it takes me.”</p>
