    <p>Mr Hau Teck Poh had been in the con­struc­tion line for more than 35 years be­fore his su­per­vi­sor job at a sub­con­trac­tor firm was af­fected by the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>For the past seven months, he has been sec­onded to work as a store­keeper at Ger­man lo­gis­tics firm DB Schenker. Among his tasks are scan­ning prod­ucts, ar­rang­ing them onto pal­lets and ver­i­fy­ing de­tails such as de­liv­ery ad­dresses.</p>
    <p>“The ex­pe­ri­ence has been good so far,” said the 57-year-old, who will be work­ing there un­til his sub­con­trac­tor com­pany gets new projects and re­quests for him to re­turn. “I thought they might not have a good im­pres­sion of us since we were older and had no ex­pe­ri­ence. How­ever, the su­per­vi­sors and col­leagues were friendly and al­ways will­ing to help.”</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers with hir­ing de­mand are tak­ing in work­ers from other com­pa­nies in hard-hit sec­tors – such as aero­space, avi­a­tion and hos­pi­tal­ity – on a sec­ond­ment ba­sis.</p>
    <p>There are 13 com­pa­nies that have taken in close to 380 work­ers through this ap­proach be­tween April and Septem­ber, Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG) told The Sun­day Times. Some of the sec­tors tak­ing in work­ers on sec­ond­ment in­clude lo­gis­tics, whole­sale trade and en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>WSG said em­ploy­ers with man­power needs can gain ac­cess to a wider pool of tal­ent, while work­ers “re­main gain­fully em­ployed and widen their ex­po­sure dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod”.</p>
    <p>The job match­ing con­sid­ers fac­tors such as the job scope and skills re­quired, re­mu­ner­a­tion, as well as the time­frame when the work­ers can be re­leased.</p>
    <p>Sec­onded work­ers, who can re­turn to their firms when their in­dus­tries pick up mo­men­tum, get on­the-job train­ing from their su­per­vi­sors or ex­pe­ri­enced col­leagues.</p>
    <p>DB Schenker, for in­stance, took in 21 work­ers from Ra­zor So­lu­tions, a sub­con­trac­tor spe­cial­is­ing in avi­a­tion ground op­er­a­tions whose project with ground han­dler and in-flight caterer Sats was sus­pended due to the out­break.</p>
    <p>The sec­onded em­ploy­ees, whose pre­vi­ous roles in­cluded bag­gage han­dling, now work in its lo­gis­tics fa­cil­i­ties pack­ing prod­ucts and la­belling pal­lets, among other tasks.</p>
    <p>De­spite not hav­ing any prior ex­pe­ri­ence, they “gen­er­ally have a pos­i­tive at­ti­tude and are will­ing to take on new chal­lenges”, said DB Schenker, which pays their salaries through Ra­zor So­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ees would have more op­por­tu­ni­ties to de­velop new skill sets, gain ex­pe­ri­ence and broaden their ca­reer hori­zon.”</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies that have been heav­ily af­fected by Covid-19 said they had to find vi­able al­ter­na­tive work ar­range­ments for their staff.</p>
    <p>UBTS, which is in the lo­gis­tics line, sent 33 work­ers on sec­ond­ment to dif­fer­ent firms. Its air­port business was af­fected when air­line op­er­a­tions were sus­pended ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>The firm did so be­cause it wanted to re­tain as many of the work­ers from its air­port op­er­a­tions as it could. Most of them are fully trained and have valu­able ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“This is crit­i­cal in en­sur­ing that when there is a re­sump­tion of air­port op­er­a­tions, the time­line needed to train new i nex­pe­ri­enced staff will be min­i­mal,” it added.</p>
    <p>En­gi­neer­ing firm Hope Tech­nik, which faced an in­creased de­mand for its tem­per­a­ture screen­ing de­vices dur­ing this out­break, took in eight UBTS staff in the mid­dle of this year as it needed ex­tra man­power to as­sem­ble the sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Many of these work­ers, whose salaries are paid by Hope Tech­nik</p>
    <p>UBTS, which is in the lo­gis­tics line, sent 33 work­ers on sec­ond­ment to dif­fer­ent firms.

    <p>through UBTS, had held front-fac­ing roles, where they en­gaged more with air­line pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>While theirs was a mainly cus­tomer ser­vice skill set, “through re­train­ing and their will­ing­ness to learn, they have picked up new abil­i­ties in their few months here with us”, said Mr Mar­cus Tan, head of man­u­fac­tur­ing at Hope Tech­nik.</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore se­nior eco­nom­ics lec­turer Kelvin Seah said ar­range­ments to tem­po­rar­ily re­de­ploy work­ers to less-af­fected and po­ten­tially grow­ing jobs and in­dus­tries are a good way to put man­power re­sources to good use and save jobs.</p>
    <p>“When de­mand in the hard-hit sec­tors picks up again, they can then be re­de­ployed back to their orig­i­nal jobs,” he added.</p>
    <p>WSG said these work­ers are sec­onded to the host com­pany “to sup­port im­me­di­ate ca­pac­ity needs”.</p>
    <p>“If there is any in­ter­est in hir­ing the work­ers, the host com­pany should ap­proach the work­ers’ em­ployer to dis­cuss and work out a mu­tu­ally agree­able ar­range­ment on the re­lease of the work­ers,” it added.</p>
