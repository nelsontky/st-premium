    <p>It is pos­si­ble to break through as an ac­tor at age 80. That seems to have hap­pened to Lance Hen­rik­sen.</p>
    <p>As Willis, the ter­ri­fy­ingly con­ser­va­tive dad in the fam­ily drama Fall­ing, the Amer­i­can ac­tor, best known for play­ing the an­droid Bishop in science-fic­tion thriller Aliens (1986), has made crit­ics sit up.</p>
    <p>His co-star Viggo Mortensen, who wrote and makes his di­rec­to­rial de­but with the film, tells The Straits Times in an e-mail in­ter­view that Hen­rik­sen “as an ac­tor is as un­set­tling and un­com­pro­mis­ingly fierce as Willis needed to be”.</p>
    <p>“In fact, look­ing him in the eye when he is not smil­ing is a bit like look­ing into the face of a wolf or a raven.”</p>
    <p>They first worked to­gether on Ap­paloosa (2008), a Western. As Mortensen notes, Hen­rik­sen “projects a uniquely strong – even in­tim­i­dat­ing – pres­ence and voice”.</p>
    <p>In Fall­ing, which is show­ing in cin­e­mas, the 62-year-old Dan­ishAmer­i­can ac­tor plays John Peter­son, a man who lives in a mid­dle­class sub­urb with his hus­band Eric (Terry Chen) and daugh­ter Mon­ica (Gabby Velis).</p>
    <p>His father Willis (Hen­rik­sen), who lives alone on his farm, is in de­clin­ing health be­cause of de­men­tia. John brings Willis into his home so he can be cared for.</p>
    <p>The act of shel­ter­ing the man whose tough-guy abra­sive­ness has alien­ated ev­ery­one close to him strains John’s re­la­tion­ships with Eric and his sis­ter Sarah (Laura Lin­ney), and also sets the stage for father and son to un­cover long­buried griev­ances.</p>
    <p>Cast­ing Hen­rik­sen as Willis was a de­ci­sion Mortensen had made early in the film’s pro­duc­tion. Af­ter the older ac­tor was brought on board, they be­gan re­hearsals and ev­ery­thing fell i nto place for Mortensen to play his son.</p>
    <p>“I had al­ready been work­ing for quite some time on the screen­play and on the John-Willis re­la­tion­ship in par­tic­u­lar, with Lance Hen­rik­sen,” he re­calls.</p>
    <p>“We had al­ready achieved a level of trust and un­der­stand­ing, as well as by get­ting to know and like each other per­son­ally.”</p>
    <p>That close­ness with Hen­rik­sen, as well as more mun­dane is­sues such as bud­get and the time it would take to re­hearse with another ac­tor, made Mortensen de­cide to play John.</p>
    <p>“Know­ing that we would not have as many days to shoot as I would ideally like and the fact that I would not be paid as an ac­tor was also, frankly, a sig­nif­i­cant ad­van­tage to the pro­duc­tion.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing to j ug­gle the roles of ac­tor, di­rec­tor and screen­writer might have its dis­ad­van­tages, but there are also some pluses to be­ing the au­teur, he adds.</p>
    <p>“It seemed con­ve­nient to be able to make changes to the script, to re­struc­ture or edit it as deemed most de­sir­able along the way – with­out hav­ing to ex­plain or apol­o­gise to the writer.”</p>
    <p>The story is a fic­tion­alised ac­count that is broadly in­spired by events in Mortensen’s life, he ex­plains.</p>
    <p>“The first-hand ex­pe­ri­ences I have had with de­men­tia in our fam­ily helped me con­ceive of the char­ac­ter of Willis and his re­la­tion­ships with his chil­dren and the rest of the Peter­son fam­ily,” he says.</p>
    <p>His own father was not any­where near as “con­sis­tently bel­liger­ent or mis­an­thropic as Willis is”, Mortensen adds. But like a lot of men shaped by ad­ver­sity, he val­ued tough­ness, a trait of­ten at odds with what one ex­pects of a nur­tur­ing par­ent.</p>
    <p>“He was born and raised on a farm dur­ing the Great De­pres­sion and ran away from home be­fore fin­ish­ing school dur­ing the Nazi oc­cu­pa­tion of Den­mark,” Mortensen says.</p>
    <p>“He was very much a self-made busi­ness­man and father type. Like Willis, he was rather in­flex­i­ble and re­sis­tant to ideas that came with chang­ing times in the 1960s and 1970s.”</p>
    <p>Fall­ing (R21, 113 min­utes) is show­ing in cin­e­mas.</p>
