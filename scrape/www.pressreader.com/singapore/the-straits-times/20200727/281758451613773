    <p>MADRID • Spain is scram­bling to stay ahead of new out­breaks of the coronaviru­s that prompted Bri­tain to im­pose a quar­an­tine on trav­ellers re­turn­ing from the coun­try, deal­ing a new blow to its touris­mde­pen­dent econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The Span­ish govern­ment said yes­ter­day that in spite of the re­cent surge in cases, the sit­u­a­tion there is “under con­trol”. “The Span­ish govern­ment con­sid­ers that the sit­u­a­tion is under con­trol, the out­breaks have been lo­cated, iso­lated and con­trolled,” the For­eign Min­istry told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>“Spain is a safe coun­try.”</p>
    <p>The state­ment comes in re­sponse to coun­tries that have re­cently an­nounced travel re­stric­tions on Spain fol­low­ing a spike in cases, par­tic­u­larly in the Cat­alo­nia re­gion, where the au­thor­i­ties are rac­ing to stamp out new out­breaks.</p>
    <p>Only weeks af­ter Bri­tain in­cluded Spain on a list of coun­tries safe for sum­mer hol­i­days, the Bri­tish govern­ment re­versed course and an­nounced on Satur­day that it would im­pose a 14-day quar­an­tine on any­one ar­riv­ing from Spain.</p>
    <p>Nor­way an­nounced last Fri­day a 10-day quar­an­tine for peo­ple re­turn­ing from Spain, and France is­sued new travel warn­ings for the Cat­alo­nia re­gion, which is home to Barcelona and pop­u­lar beaches.</p>
    <p>The moves will fur­ther weigh on book­ings in the peak travel pe­riod for a coun­try that de­pends on tourism for more than 10 per cent of its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct.</p>
    <p>Spain re­ported nearly a thou­sand new cases a day on both Thurs­day and Fri­day, the high­est num­bers since early May, when the Span­ish govern­ment be­gan eas­ing one of Europe’s strictest lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Its num­ber of cases has tripled in two weeks, while more than 280 homes are be­ing closely mon­i­tored by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“We are quite frus­trated. We ac­tu­ally feel safer here be­cause ev­ery­one is wear­ing masks,” Ms Carolyne Lansell, a Bri­tish tourist, said in an in­ter­view with Span­ish state-tele­vi­sion broad­caster TVE.</p>
    <p>Spain was one of the hard­est-hit coun­tries in Europe by the coronaviru­s and has al­ready suf­fered 28,432 fa­tal­i­ties, the fourth-high­est tally in Europe af­ter Bri­tain, Italy and France.</p>
    <p>How­ever, an in­ves­ti­ga­tion by El Pais news­pa­per pub­lished yes­ter­day said Spain’s Covid-19 death toll could be nearly 60 per cent higher than the of­fi­cial fig­ure.</p>
    <p>By count­ing re­gional sta­tis­tics of all sus­pected and con­firmed fa­tal­i­ties from the virus, El Pais reached a to­tal of 44,868 deaths.</p>
    <p>If ac­cu­rate, that would make Spain’s out­break the sec­ond dead­li­est in Europe af­ter Bri­tain’s.</p>
    <p>A na­tional lock­down started in March had largely tamed the spread of Covid-19, but the eas­ing of those re­stric­tions and the start of the sum­mer tourism sea­son have con­trib­uted to an uptick, par­tic­u­larly among young peo­ple fre­quent­ing crowded bars and clubs.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries around the Mediter­ranean Sea were praying that a glimpse of tourism would get them through the sum­mer be­fore the cold snap drives peo­ple in­doors and ush­ers in a sec­ond chap­ter to the pan­demic. Now, it ap­pears the spread of the virus may not wait for the win­ter months.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments have been brac­ing them­selves for a sec­ond wave, though there is lit­tle ap­petite for reim­pos­ing large-scale lock­downs on al­ready crip­pled economies.</p>
    <p>The hope is that lo­cal­is­ing quar­an­tines to towns, cities and re­gions will be enough to snuff out bouts of in­fec­tions as they come.</p>
    <p>Italy was the first Western democ­racy to quar­an­tine the en­tire pop­u­la­tion as it be­came ap­par­ent its death toll was go­ing to over­take that of China. A per­son close to Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte de­scribed that de­ci­sion as “shock ther­apy” that can­not be re­peated.</p>
    <p>French Prime Min­is­ter Jean Cas­tex was equally blunt, say­ing: “We won’t sur­vive, eco­nom­i­cally and so­cially.”</p>
    <p>With the world fac­ing its worst re­ces­sion since the Great De­pres­sion and United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump fight­ing for re-elec­tion in Novem­ber, vot­ers are on edge. Politi­cians of all stripes are look­ing for ways to ease the pain – not add to it – as fear morphs into anger and dis­con­tent.</p>
    <p>“Pop­u­la­tions can be sum­moned to heroic acts of col­lec­tive self-sac­ri­fice for a while, but not for­ever,” po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Fran­cis Fukuyama wrote in For­eign Af­fairs mag­a­zine. “A lin­ger­ing epi­demic com­bined with deep job losses, a pro­longed re­ces­sion and an un­prece­dented debt bur­den will in­evitably cre­ate ten­sions that turn into a po­lit­i­cal back­lash, but against whom is as yet un­clear.”</p>
    <p>The po­lit­i­cal cal­cu­lus is to try and ride it out. Yet, while ef­forts to get peo­ple back to stores, restau­rants, bars and hair­dressers demon­strate the ur­gency among gov­ern­ments of re­viv­ing economies, they also show the risks.</p>
