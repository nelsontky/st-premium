    <p>Twelve works over 12 hours – lo­cal dance com­pany Raw Moves’ lat­est on­line marathon is a lot to han­dle. View­ers should pace them­selves.</p>
    <p>Raw­Ground, one of Raw Moves’ yearly plat­forms, sup­ports re­search by a wide range of artists be­yond the usual com­pany dancers.</p>
    <p>This year’s edi­tion, ini­tially planned as a three-month res­i­dency process, was al­ready un­der way be­fore the pan­demic struck and has since been reimag­ined as an on­line marathon.</p>
    <p>And what an in­tense marathon it is. Twelve video works, each be­tween 20 and 30 min­utes, were re­leased – one ev­ery hour – on Nov 28 from noon to 11pm.</p>
    <p>Most feel too long and repet­i­tive. A good way to en­joy these works is to be se­lec­tive. Putting un­due pres­sure on your­self to watch ev­ery video mars your en­joy­ment and de­tracts from the sense of choice this for­mat of­fers.</p>
    <p>The most fas­ci­nat­ing works are those which give an in­sight into as­pects of iden­tity that might be un­fa­mil­iar to most au­di­ences.</p>
    <p>My Pa’s Colours by Thai artist Ti­tisa Jeam­sakul, also known as Ice, is a heart­warm­ing fa­ther­daugh­ter con­ver­sa­tion which at first seems to be about the fa­ther’s rare form of colour vi­sion de­fi­ciency, but opens up to re­veal much more about his re­la­tion­ship with his daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>For­mer Raw Moves com­pany dancer Me­lyn Chow’s To Hold & To Have sim­i­larly draws from the artist’s mem­o­ries and ex­plores her per­cep­tion of mar­riage as mod­elled by her par­ents. It opens with the stylised yet in­ti­mate scene of Chow’s par­ents blithely rolling on their bed, as the au­di­ence watches voyeuris­ti­cally. In the fi­nal sec­tion, their wed­ding por­trait ap­pears in mun­dane hid­ing places such as a freezer or a uten­sils drawer.</p>
    <p>In Faces by Lee En Jie, the 17-year-old artist, who has autism, sits op­po­site a guest, each mak­ing a quick por­trait sketch of the other. He re­peats this with six of his fam­ily mem­bers, although in the orig­i­nal plan, the par­tic­i­pants would have been strangers from the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>There is some­thing med­i­ta­tive and beau­ti­ful about this seem­ingly sim­ple process, which in­vites the au­di­ence to con­tem­plate how they per­ceive neu­rotyp­i­cal and neu­ro­di­ver­gent in­di­vid­u­als. No smoke and mir­rors are nec­es­sary to cre­ate a com­pelling per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>One thing ev­i­dent through­out this marathon is the care taken in trans­lat­ing the works to the dig­i­tal medium via Chen Jiex­iao’s cin­e­matog­ra­phy.Well-planned cam­era an­gles pro­duce per­spec­tives un­avail­able in a face-to-face per­for­mance, such as close-ups of per­form­ers’ body parts and the ma­te­ri­als of the set and props.</p>
    <p>One is re­minded that it is not enough to record live works for dig­i­tal con­sump­tion and that the trans­la­tion needs to be a col­lab­o­ra­tive process be­tween film-maker and per­former.</p>
