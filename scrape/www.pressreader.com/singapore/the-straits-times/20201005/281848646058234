    <p>TOKYO • At a trendy Tokyo cock­tail bar, cus­tomers sip brightly coloured bev­er­ages with so­phis­ti­cated flavour pro­files, de­signed for a small but grow­ing mar­ket in hard-drink­ing Ja­pan: tee­to­tallers.</p>
    <p>At 0%, all the cock­tails are non-al­co­holic, but the bar is still some­thing of an anom­aly i n Ja­pan, where drink­ing is pop­u­lar and con­sid­ered an im­por­tant part of business cul­ture.</p>
    <p>With al­co­hol as a lu­bri­cant, the for­mal­ity that can gov­ern the Ja­panese work­place slips away, and drink­ing – of­ten heav­ily – with col­leagues is seen as im­por­tant to ca­reer ad­vance­ment for some.</p>
    <p>There is even a word for drink­ing with col­leagues – “no­mini­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>It is a port­man­teau of the word for drink – nomi – in Ja­panese and the English word “com­mu­ni­ca­tion”.</p>
    <p>That has long put non-drinkers like Mr Hideto Fu­jino, a 54-yearold fund man­ager, at a dis­ad­van­tage, but he and oth­ers like him are speak­ing out and find­ing they are not alone.</p>
    <p>“There are many times that non­drinkers feel un­com­fort­able,” he told Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>“You some­times hear state­ments like, ‘you can’t get pro­moted if you can’t drink al­co­hol’,” said Mr Fu­jino, who started a Face­book group for non-drinkers.</p>
    <p>He does not drink be­cause he can­not process al­co­hol well.</p>
    <p>Like about 5 per cent of Ja­panese and many other East Asians, he lacks some of the en­zymes that break down the toxic by-prod­ucts of al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>Those with the ge­netic dis­po­si­tion suf­fer var­i­ous side ef­fects in­clud­ing flushed cheeks and feel­ing sick when they drink.</p>
    <p>But there are plenty of other rea­sons that peo­ple do not drink, said Mr Fu­jino, whose Face­book group at­tracted over 4,000 mem­bers within months of him cre­at­ing it.</p>
    <p>Some cite health rea­sons or pregnancy, while oth­ers dis­like al­co­hol or its ef­fects on them.</p>
    <p>Some like drink­ing but have de­cided to cut back – a group that is grow­ing in other parts of the world and is some­times termed “sober cu­ri­ous”.</p>
    <p>Ms Mayumi Ya­mamoto, 31, who started 0%, said she was in­spired to of­fer bet­ter non-al­co­holic drinks by her own ex­pe­ri­ence as a tee­to­taller.</p>
    <p>“I thought it would be great if there were drink menu op­tions other than tea and car­bon­ated wa­ter for peo­ple like me who can’t drink much al­co­hol,” she said.</p>
    <p>BET­TER BOOZE-FREE OP­TIONS</p>
    <p>The bar in the pop­u­lar nightlife area of Rop­pongi, fa­mous for clubs and drink­ing holes, of­fers ve­gan food along­side cock­tails in­fused with in­gre­di­ents in­clud­ing basil, mas­car­pone cheese, sea­weed and berries.</p>
    <p>Among the cus­tomers one Satur­day evening was Ms Rei Azezaki, 21, who is al­ler­gic to al­co­hol and had brought along her boyfriend, who is a drinker.</p>
    <p>“Usu­ally I drink a lot of al­co­hol,” said Mr Yuto Taka­hashi, 24. “But here I en­joy drinks more slowly, it’s like I’m ap­pre­ci­at­ing the at­mos­phere more. I like it very much.”</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar booze-free bars are crop­ping up else­where in Ja­pan, with their lo­ca­tions en­thu­si­as­ti­cally shared on Mr Fu­jino’s Face­book group, and Health Min­istry data sug­gests heavy drink­ing is fall­ing among young peo­ple.</p>
    <p>In 2017, just 16 per cent of men in their 20s and 25 per cent of those in their 30s drank the equiv­a­lent of two or more glasses of wine at least three days a week – half the num­ber in both age groups from a decade ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Ms Naoko Kuga, a senior re­searcher at NLI Re­search In­sti­tute, has stud­ied the chang­ing al­co­hol mar­ket in Ja­pan and says young peo­ple in­creas­ingly have a dif­fer­ent re­la­tion­ship with al­co­hol, par­tic­u­larly around col­leagues.</p>
    <p>“Young peo­ple don’t want that old ‘no­mini­ca­tion’ with su­pe­ri­ors that lasts hours,” she said.</p>
    <p>“They’ll choose what they want as the first glass, and it might well be non-al­co­holic.”</p>
    <p>I thought it would be great if there were drink menu op­tions other than tea and car­bon­ated wa­ter for peo­ple like me who can’t drink much al­co­hol.</p>
    <p>MS MAYUMI YA­MAMOTO, who started the booze-free 0% cock­tail bar, on be­ing in­spired to of­fer bet­ter non-al­co­holic drinks by her own ex­pe­ri­ence as a tee­to­taller.</p>
