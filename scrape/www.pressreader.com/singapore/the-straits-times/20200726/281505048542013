    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounced his new Cabi­net yes­ter­day, which sought to strike a bal­ance be­tween con­ti­nu­ity pro­vided by his se­nior col­leagues, ex­po­sure for younger min­is­ters and lead­er­ship re­newal, as Sin­ga­pore nav­i­gates its worst cri­sis since in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>The new line-up will see six of the 15 min­istries hav­ing a change in min­is­ter. Seven of the PAP’s new faces have also been ap­pointed po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers, with the old­est among them – Dr Tan See Leng, 55 – made a full min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Most older min­is­ters – in­clud­ing Se­nior Min­is­ters Teo Chee Hean and Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam – will stay on to pro­vide con­ti­nu­ity amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat’s role over­see­ing the na­tion’s econ­omy has been ce­mented. Apart from con­tin­u­ing as Fi­nance Min­is­ter, he will take on an ad­di­tional role as Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for Eco­nomic Poli­cies.</p>
    <p>This for­malises the role Mr Heng was play­ing in the last term, said PM Lee. Mr Heng chairs the Fu­ture Econ­omy Coun­cil as well as the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that hav­ing ex­pe­ri­enced lead­ers at the helm was es­pe­cially im­por­tant to tackle the on­go­ing cri­sis, PM Lee said at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence held at the Is­tana: “We need ex­pe­ri­enced min­is­ters to pro­vide steady hands, and also to men­tor the younger min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>“And in this cri­sis, this need is even greater. We are in the thick of a grave cri­sis, deal­ing with a fast mov­ing un­cer­tain sit­u­a­tion... And this puts a pre­mium on ex­pe­ri­ence and a sure touch.”</p>
    <p>That was why most min­is­ters of this Cabi­net had the ex­pe­ri­ence of serv­ing at least one term as po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>The reshuf­fle also ex­poses younger min­is­ters to dif­fer­ent port­fo­lios and brings in fresh faces as part of the re­newal process.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, the new Cabi­net will have 37 of­fice-hold­ers – the same num­ber as in the pre­vi­ous one.</p>
    <p>Said PM Lee: “It is a team with ex­pe­ri­ence and depth, with se­nior mem­bers tem­pered by the chal­lenges that they have gone through to­gether, re­in­forced with younger mem­bers who will bring dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives to bear, and fresh ideas and en­ergy to take us for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Mr Lawrence Wong will helm the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry, while Mr Des­mond Lee will move from the Min­istry for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment to suc­ceed him at the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­istry.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong Ye Kung will move from the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry to head the Trans­port Min­istry, which was for­merly helmed by Mr Khaw Boon Wan, who has re­tired from pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources has been re­named as the Min­istry of Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, to bet­ter re­flect its fu­ture role as sus­tain­abil­ity has be­come an in­creas­ingly im­por­tant part of the na­tional agenda. It will be headed by Ms Grace Fu.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli will leave that min­istry and move to head the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment. He will re­main the Min­is­ter-in-charge of Mus­lim Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Two se­nior min­is­ters of state have been pro­moted. Mr Ed­win Tong suc­ceeds Ms Fu as Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, while Dr Ma­liki Os­man is Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice.</p>
    <p>PM Lee, 68, re­it­er­ated his pledge to see the coun­try through the cri­sis. He had pre­vi­ously stated his hope to re­tire from pol­i­tics by his 70th birthday, which is in 2022.</p>
    <p>“But I do not de­ter­mine the path of the Covid-19 pan­demic, and a lot will de­pend on how events un­fold,” he said. “And all I can say is, I will see this through, and I’ll hand over in good shape as soon as pos­si­ble to the next team, and into good hands.”</p>
    <p>The Cabi­net and other of­fice­hold­ers will be for­mally sworn in to­mor­row.</p>
