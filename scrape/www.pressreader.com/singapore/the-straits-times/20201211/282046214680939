    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s first as­sisted liv­ing pub­lic hous­ing in Bukit Ba­tok for se­niors aged 65 and above who wish to live on their own and yet en­joy some care, sup­port and com­mu­nal ac­tiv­i­ties will be launched for sale in a Build-To-Or­der ex­er­cise next Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Dubbed Com­mu­nity Care Apart­ments, this new flat type comes with a manda­tory ser­vice pack­age to sup­port se­niors to age in place, said the Min­istry of Na­tional Devel­op­ment, Hous­ing Board (HDB) and the Min­istry of Health in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ser­vices un­der the pack­age in­clude 24-hour emer­gency mon­i­tor­ing and re­sponse ser­vice, basic health checks, sim­ple home fixes and ac­tiv­i­ties at the com­mu­nal spa­ces within the devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>All res­i­dents will have to sub­scribe and pay for the basic ser­vice pack­age, which starts at $22,000 for a 15-year lease.</p>
    <p>Other ser­vices such as house­keep­ing, laun­dry, meal de­liv­ery and shared care­giv­ing can be added at ex­tra cost.</p>
    <p>Se­niors must be 65 and above to ap­ply for these flats. They can choose a lease rang­ing from 15 years to 35 years, in five-year in­cre­ments, as long as it cov­ers the ap­pli­cant and his spouse, if any, un­til they are at least 95 years old.</p>
    <p>Prices for these flats start from $40,000 for a 15-year lease to $65,000 for a 35-year lease, and must be fully paid up­front with cash or with Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) sav­ings.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies such as the Sil­ver Hous­ing Bonus, which gives se­niors up to $30,000 cash bonus when they sell their ex­ist­ing flat and top up their pro­ceeds to their CPF Re­tire­ment Ac­count, are ap­pli­ca­ble.</p>
    <p>How­ever, these flats can­not be resold or rented out. Own­ers who no longer need the flat can re­turn it to the HDB, which will re­fund them the value of the re­main­ing lease of the flat.</p>
    <p>Se­niors with more press­ing care needs, such as those re­quir­ing per­ma­nent as­sis­tance with ac­tiv­i­ties of daily liv­ing, will be pri­ori­tised for the flats.</p>
    <p>The new flats are a step up from Kam­pung Ad­mi­ralty, an in­te­grated re­tire­ment com­mu­nity devel­op­ment com­pleted in 2017 that con­nects HDB blocks to a wide range of so­cial and health­care fa­cil­i­ties meant for se­niors.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot batch of Com­mu­nity Care Apart­ments, lo­cated in Bukit Ba­tok West Av­enue 9, com­prises about 160 units and is ex­pected to be com­pleted in 2024.</p>
    <p>The flats were sched­uled to be launched in May this year but were de­layed ow­ing to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Each 32 sq m flat comes with se­nior-friendly fit­tings – in­clud­ing grab bars and a wheel­chair-ac­ces­si­ble bath­room with slip-re­sis­tant floor­ing – to let res­i­dents move around in their homes with ease.</p>
    <p>The flats have an open lay­out and come with slid­ing par­ti­tions to sep­a­rate the liv­ing room and bed­room, along with a built-in wardrobe, cab­i­nets and a fur­nished kitchen to re­duce ren­o­va­tion time.</p>
    <p>There will be fur­nished com­mu­nal spa­ces on each floor for res­i­dents to share meals or par­tic­i­pate in group ac­tiv­i­ties, which serve as “ex­ten­sions of their own liv­ing rooms”, said the agen­cies.</p>
    <p>A com­mu­nity man­ager will be on site to or­gan­ise com­mu­nity ac­tiv­i­ties and link se­niors to care ser­vices rel­e­vant to their needs.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents will also get pri­or­ity for ad­mis­sion to the nearby Bukit Ba­tok Care Home should the need arise.</p>
    <p>Other ameni­ties within the devel­op­ment in­clude a precinct pavil­ion, strolling path, ac­tiv­ity cen­tre, hawker cen­tre, com­mu­nity gar­den and fit­ness sta­tion.</p>
    <p>From next Mon­day to March 31, se­niors and mem­bers of the pub­lic will be able to visit a life-size show­case of the com­mu­nal space, along with scaled mod­els of the block and flat, at the HDB Hub atrium in Lorong 6 Toa Payoh.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors must book an ap­point­ment via HDB In­foWeb be­fore vis­it­ing.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Na­tional Devel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee said the new pub­lic hous­ing con­cept “will broaden to­day’s op­tions for se­niors who re­quire some care and sup­port within their homes, but are still able to and wish to live on their own”.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said feed­back from se­niors and their chil­dren, ser­vice providers, health pro­fes­sion­als and care­givers was taken into con­sid­er­a­tion when plan­ning the new flats.</p>
    <p>He said: “Our se­niors can look for­ward to liv­ing in­de­pen­dently even as their care needs change, and en­joy more op­por­tu­ni­ties to stay ac­tive and take charge of their health through spe­cially cu­rated pro­grammes and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“Se­niors and care­givers will also be bet­ter able to nav­i­gate the spec­trum of so­cial and health sup­port ser­vices with help from the com­mu­nity man­ager.”</p>
