    <p>HONG KONG Hong Kong will ex­tend virus-re­lated so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures for an­other week amid per­sist­ing signs of hid­den Covid-19 trans­mis­sion, said Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam.</p>
    <p>De­spite mod­er­at­ing num­bers, “we still have un­known cases and it im­plies that there is (a) silent trans­mis­sion chain in our com­mu­nity”, Mrs Lam said yes­ter­day at a weekly brief­ing be­fore a meet­ing of her ad­vi­sory Ex­ec­u­tive Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>Bars, pools and theme parks in Hong Kong were al­lowed to re­open last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Bars were al­lowed to open un­til mid­night, and dine-in ser­vices at restau­rants were ex­tended by two hours, also un­til mid­night.</p>
    <p>The limit on pub­lic gath­er­ings will be kept at four peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The re­stric­tions are now due to ex­pire on Oct 1 – China’s Na­tional Day hol­i­day – which has typ­i­cally seen pro-democ­racy protests in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivists are con­cerned that the gov­ern­ment is us­ing Covid-19 so­cial mea­sures to hin­der their abil­ity to hold demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong reported two new lo­cal cases on Mon­day, with four im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Mrs Lam said Hong Kong’s le­gal sys­tem re­mained in­tact, af­ter a for­eign judge sit­ting in the city’s top court re­signed, cit­ing con­cerns about the con­tro­ver­sial na­tional se­cu­rity law.</p>
    <p>She said: “We have gone all out to ex­plain to the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity, as well as our in­ter­locu­tors in var­i­ous places, that the le­gal sys­tem is as ro­bust as ever un­der the na­tional se­cu­rity law, that ju­di­cial in­de­pen­dence is not un­der­mined in any way, that Hong Kong now re­stores law and or­der which makes it an even more at­trac­tive place for do­ing busi­ness.”</p>
