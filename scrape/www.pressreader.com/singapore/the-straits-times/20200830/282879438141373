    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A It was in buy­ing a fran­chise dessert busi­ness from Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>When I brought the brand into Sin­ga­pore, I did not cater to the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket and, hence, a prod­uct mis­fit oc­curred.</p>
    <p>Af­ter two years of oper­a­tions and los­ing close to $1 mil­lion, we closed the brand and re­fo­cused our ef­forts back on our Green­dot busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Now, as I look back, we could have de­ployed our time, en­ergy and re­sources back into scal­ing our core busi­ness or shar­ing more prof­its with our em­ploy­ees. It is un­ques­tion­ably a les­son learnt.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A The best in­vest­ment I have had so far is in books as they keep me learn­ing about peo­ple and busi­ness man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Some of the self-help books that I fre­quently go back to are The In­tel­li­gent In­vestor by Ben­jamin Gra­ham and How To Win Friends And In­flu­ence Peo­ple by Dale Carnegie.</p>
    <p>Such books have am­ple her­itage and a real im­pact on how I han­dle, win and lead peo­ple around me. They also en­abled me to per­form an in-depth self­e­val­u­a­tion where I was able to not only high­light my short­com­ings, but rec­tify them as well.</p>
    <p>The best in­vest­ment is also time with family. As busy as I am, I know I can’t buy back time with my family and loved ones. I started to have more work-life bal­ance and time with my family when I had my son Ean.</p>
