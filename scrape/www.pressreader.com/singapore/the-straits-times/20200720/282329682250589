    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United States econ­omy is headed for a tu­mul­tuous au­tumn, with the threat of closed schools, re­newed gov­ern­ment lock­downs and an un­cer­tain amount of fed­eral sup­port for busi­nesses and un­em­ployed work­ers all cloud­ing hopes for a rapid re­bound from re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>For months, the pre­vail­ing wis­dom among in­vestors, Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials and many eco­nomic fore­cast­ers was that after plung­ing into re­ces­sion this spring, the coun­try’s re­cov­ery would ac­cel­er­ate in late sum­mer and take off in au­tumn as the virus re­ceded, re­stric­tions on com­merce loos­ened, and con­sumers re­verted to more nor­mal spend­ing pat­terns.</p>
    <p>Job gains in May and last month fu­elled those rosy pre­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>But fail­ure to sup­press a resur­gence of in­fec­tions is threat­en­ing to choke the re­cov­ery and push the coun­try back into a re­ces­sion­ary spi­ral – un­less Congress re­con­sid­ers the scale of fed­eral aid that may be re­quired in the months to come.</p>
    <p>Most economists have aban­doned hope for a “V-shaped” re­cov­ery long ago. Now, they are warn­ing of an out­right re­ver­sal, with mount­ing job losses and busi­ness fail­ures. And this time, much of the dam­age is likely to be per­ma­nent.</p>
    <p>“Our as­sump­tion has to be that we’re go­ing into re-lock­down in the fall,” said Dr Karl Smith, vice-pres­i­dent of fed­eral pol­icy at con­ser­va­tive Tax Foun­da­tion in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>The loom­ing eco­nomic pain was ev­i­dent last week as big com­pa­nies forecast gloomy months ahead and gov­ern­ment data showed re­newed strug­gles in the job mar­ket.</p>
    <p>A weekly cen­sus sur­vey last Wed­nes­day showed a 1.3 mil­lion drop in the num­ber of Amer­i­cans with jobs in the pre­vi­ous week.</p>
    <p>A new Amer­i­can En­ter­prise In­sti­tute anal­y­sis from Safe­graph.com of shop­per traf­fic to stores showed busi­ness ac­tiv­ity had plunged in the sec­ond week of this month, in part from re­newed virus fears.</p>
    <p>The big­gest US banks also warned last week that they are set­ting aside bil­lions of dol­lars to cover an­tic­i­pated losses as cus­tomers fail to pay their mort­gages and other loans in the months to come.</p>
    <p>May and last month will prove to be “easy” in terms of re­cov­ery, Ms Jennifer Piep­szak, the chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer of JPMor­gan Chase, said dur­ing an an­a­lyst call last Tues­day. “We’re re­ally hit­ting the mo­ment of truth, I think, in the months ahead.”</p>
    <p>Mr Jamie Di­mon, the bank’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, said much of the eco­nomic pain had been blunted by fed­eral spend­ing, which was now run­ning out. “You will see the ef­fect of this re­ces­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies that used small­busi­ness loans to re­tain or re­hire work­ers are now be­gin­ning to lay off em­ploy­ees as those funds run out, while busi­ness ac­tiv­ity re­mains de­pressed.</p>
    <p>Ex­panded ben­e­fits for un­em­ployed work­ers, which re­search shows have been prop­ping up con­sumer spend­ing through­out the spring and early sum­mer, are sched­uled to ex­pire at the end of this month, while more than 18 mil­lion Amer­i­cans con­tinue to claim un­em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Many states are al­ready re­new­ing lock­downs, in­clud­ing Cal­i­for­nia, where of­fi­cials have or­dered in­door bars, restau­rants, gyms and other es­tab­lish­ments to close. Col­lege sports con­fer­ences are be­gin­ning to can­cel au­tumn sports, in­clud­ing the lu­cra­tive foot­ball sea­son, and con­cert tours are out of the pic­ture.</p>
    <p>Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials have sug­gested a will­ing­ness to ne­go­ti­ate with Democrats on un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fits, small-busi­ness aid and pos­si­bly an­other round of stim­u­lus checks, while also push­ing for busi­ness tax cuts that have found lit­tle trac­tion in Congress. Some Se­nate Repub­li­cans want to cut off pan­demic spend­ing in­creases en­tirely.</p>
    <p>Small busi­nesses around the coun­try say that if lock­downs per­sist with­out some type of ad­di­tional fi­nan­cial cush­ion from Congress, they will be faced with a dire choice.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­vis­ers con­tinue to pre­dict the econ­omy will re­bound sharply in the months ahead, and the Pres­i­dent has made in­creas­ingly in­sis­tent calls for a full re­open­ing of schools this au­tumn. Many economists agree that the econ­omy can­not fully re­cover – let alone grow – if mil­lions of young chil­dren re­main at home with­out vi­able child­care op­tions. Yet fail­ure to con­trol the virus has made re­open­ing a risky trade-off.</p>
    <p>Some of the na­tion’s largest school dis­tricts, in­clud­ing Los An­ge­les and San Diego, have an­nounced that they will not im­me­di­ately re­turn to in-per­son class­room in­struc­tion when the new school year be­gins. In New York and other large pub­lic school dis­tricts around the coun­try, of­fi­cials are pre­par­ing to bring stu­dents back for only part­time in­struc­tion and have warned par­ents they could shut down again if cases rise.</p>
    <p>Those an­nounce­ments have not been ac­com­pa­nied by gov­ern­ment­funded pro­grammes that economists say would help schools open safely or en­sure ac­cess to child­care for mil­lions of Amer­i­cans who are strug­gling to jug­gle par­ent­ing and work. Even as Mr Trump pushes a re­turn to class­rooms, many dis­tricts are fac­ing pan­demic-in­duced bud­get short­falls.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has now tried two strate­gies to raft its econ­omy through the pan­demic: shut­ting down com­merce to slow the spread of the virus and rapidly lift­ing re­stric­tions on ac­tiv­ity to get busi­ness hum­ming again. It has not fol­lowed through on ei­ther ap­proach.</p>
