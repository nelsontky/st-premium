    <p>The Sam­sung Gal­axy Note20 Ul­tra 5G is a sleek, ver­sa­tile per­former with top-notch cam­eras</p>
    <p>Sam­sung’s lat­est flag­ship Gal­axy Note20 ph­ablet se­ries will come in two mod­els – the 6.7-inch Note20 and the 6.9-inch Note20 Ul­tra.</p>
    <p>The Note20 comes in 4G ($1,398) and 5G ($1,548) ver­sions, while the Note20 Ul­tra will come only in a 5G ver­sion ($1,898). Both mod­els will be avail­able here from Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times reviews the Note20 Ul­tra 5G, which sup­ports 5G’s Sub-6GHz band­width but not its mmWave band­width. Both band­widths are slated to be rolled out in Sin­ga­pore in the near fu­ture.</p>
    <p>DE­SIGN & DIS­PLAY</p>
    <p>At first glance, there is lit­tle dif­fer­ence be­tween the Note20 Ul­tra 5G and its pre­de­ces­sor, the Gal­axy Note10+. But there are some qual­ity-of-life changes.</p>
    <p>The vol­ume and power but­tons have been moved to the right side for the Note20 Ul­tra, away from the left in Note10+.</p>
    <p>Most smart­phones have these but­tons on the right side. Those up­grad­ing from iPhones or other An­droid smart­phones will like this change.</p>
    <p>The S Pen sty­lus, used for scrib­bling hand­writ­ten notes and per­form­ing other tasks, is at the bot­tom left in­stead of bot­tom right, as with the Note10+.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the Note20 Ul­tra is a fan­tas­tic-look­ing phone – a sleek slab of dis­play with su­per-thin bezels, curved sides and a tiny holepunch front-fac­ing cam­era.</p>
    <p>The Ul­tra’s dis­play has a re­fresh rate of up to 120Hz for smoother scrolling and to pre­vent screen tear­ing when play­ing games.</p>
    <p>How­ever, you can set the dis­play only be­tween the adap­tive mode – which changes the re­fresh rate au­to­mat­i­cally to 120Hz, ac­cord­ing to con­tent – and the stan­dard 60Hz mode. I pre­fer be­ing able to set the re­fresh rate at 120Hz all the time, even if bat­tery life takes a hit.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, the dis­play looks ab­so­lutely gor­geous. Its view­ing an­gles are wide and it has vivid colours and sharp de­tails. I can marvel at it all day.</p>
    <p>The in-dis­play fin­ger­print sen­sor seems to have been im­proved. It now works most of the time on the first try, when I usu­ally will need two or three tries for the Note10+.</p>
    <p>The Note20 Ul­tra comes in three colours: black, white and bronze.</p>
    <p>I highly rec­om­mend the bronze model as it is the only one with a tex­tured matt fin­ish, which re­duces fin­ger­prints and smudges on the back of the phone.</p>
    <p>It is also the best-look­ing colour to me; the other two colours have a glossy fin­ish that at­tracts smudges.</p>
    <p>My only quib­ble about the phone’s de­sign is its large cam­era “bulge” at the rear. But I guess you can­not defy the laws of physics when you have a cam­era mo­d­ule with a 5x op­ti­cal zoom lens.</p>
    <p>CAM­ERA</p>
    <p>The Note20 Ul­tra has a rear cam­era sys­tem com­pris­ing a 12-megapixel (MP) ul­tra-wide-an­gle cam­era, a 108MP wide-an­gle cam­era and a 12MP tele­photo cam­era with 5x op­ti­cal zoom. It also fea­tures a laser aut­o­fo­cus­ing (AF) sen­sor, which the Note20 lacks.</p>
    <p>By de­fault, the 108MP cam­era uses pixel-bin­ning tech­nol­ogy, which com­bines nine pix­els into one, to pro­duce 12MP pho­tos. The 108MP high-res­o­lu­tion mode must be ac­ti­vated to get 108MP im­ages.</p>
    <p>Com­par­ing 108MP and 12MP shots of a scene pho­tographed on the same day, the former looks sharper and more de­tailed. But the high-res­o­lu­tion pho­tos take up nearly eight times more stor­age space than the nor­mal ones.</p>
    <p>The con­ve­nient 5x op­ti­cal zoom cam­era has quick AF and pro­duces sharp im­ages in bright sun­light. But I find pho­tos shot in low light­ing and at max­i­mum zoom to be a tad soft-look­ing.</p>
    <p>While the Note20 Ul­tra can go up to 50x with dig­i­tal zoom, fo­cus­ing be­comes dif­fi­cult as things get very shaky. I will use this fea­ture only like a pair of binoc­u­lars to make out things I can­not see from far.</p>
    <p>The Note20 Ul­tra has a new Pro Video mode with fast zoom speed and 8K video record­ing. What I like best is the abil­ity to se­lect the di­rec­tion in which to cap­ture the au­dio – omni-di­rec­tional, from the smart­phone’s front or back. This is great when you want to record some­one talk­ing to you and fil­ter out other noise.</p>
    <p>PER­FOR­MANCE & PRO­DUC­TIV­ITY</p>
    <p>The Note20 Ul­tra marginally out­per­forms the Note10+. In the Geek­bench 5 bench­mark tests, it scores 909 (sin­gle-core) and 2,526 (mul­ti­core). The Note10+ scores 816 (sin­gle-core) and 2,283 (multi-core).</p>
    <p>Apps launch quickly and there is no lag in any of the op­er­a­tions I try.</p>
    <p>Plus, the fan­tas­tic dis­play makes every­thing feel pol­ished.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, when I am catch­ing vir­tual crit­ters in the Poke­mon Go game, I can feel the smooth­ness of the Poke­ball-throw­ing an­i­ma­tion, as well as an “ac­cel­er­ated” feel to the in-game tran­si­tions.</p>
    <p>On the pro­duc­tiv­ity front, the Note20 Ul­tra of­fers some im­prove­ments with its Sam­sung Notes note­tak­ing app and the S Pen sty­lus.</p>
    <p>Sam­sung Notes now has a more in­tu­itive folder-man­age­ment sys­tem that lets you find notes more eas­ily, while the new sty­lus is said to have a 40 per cent im­prove­ment in la­tency over its pre­de­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>Scrib­bling on the Note20 with the S Pen feels very re­spon­sive and close to writ­ing on paper. There are also more brush types to choose for those who like to draw.</p>
    <p>The new auto-straighten func­tion also works well for me as I tend to write in a slanted way. Just tap the auto-straighten but­ton to straighten hand­writ­ten text.</p>
    <p>But the best func­tion of Sam­sung Notes is its abil­ity to record au­dio while you are writ­ing. It lets you go to the mo­ment in the record­ing that cor­re­sponds to your notes by tap­ping on a word in your notes. This will be handy for any­one who takes notes dur­ing in­ter­views, meet­ings or lec­tures.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, Sam­sung Notes now lets you im­port PDF files, as well as an­no­tate and high­light the text of these im­ported PDF files.</p>
    <p>BAT­TERY LIFE</p>
    <p>With its dis­play set at the stan­dard re­fresh rate of 60Hz, the Note20 Ul­tra clocks 17 hours and 55 min­utes in a video-loop bat­tery test.</p>
    <p>This is slightly better than the time of 17 hours 45 min­utes clocked by the Note10+. When I switch the dis­play to adap­tive mode, it clocks 13 hours and 45 min­utes.</p>
    <p>But bat­tery mileage will de­pend on us­age habits. For my typ­i­cal 12-hour work day with reg­u­lar check­ing of e-mails, Face­book and In­sta­gram feeds, I find there is still around 60 per cent bat­tery power left at the end of the day.</p>
