    <p>Hun­gry ghosts were no match for hun­gry home buy­ers as new home sales jumped to an 11-month high last month, with de­vel­op­ers sell­ing 1,256 non-landed pri­vate homes, up 16.3 per cent from the 1,080 pri­vate homes sold in July. Year on year, sales were up 11.8 per cent from 1,123.</p>
    <p>In­stead of slow­ing dur­ing the typ­i­cally quiet Hun­gry Ghost month, new home sales surged for a fourth straight month amid Sin­ga­pore’s worst re­ces­sion. Last month’s sales marked the best Au­gust per­for­mance in eight years, noted Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and consultanc­y at Orange­Tee & Tie.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, only 325 new units were sold in Au­gust 2008 amid the global fi­nan­cial crisis, and just 756 in Au­gust 2013 after a round of cool­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>At­trac­tively priced new free­hold launches cou­pled with pent-up de­mand, fol­low­ing a two-month-long cir­cuit breaker when show-flats were shut, spurred sales last month. An­a­lysts also cited low in­ter­est rates and a seg­ment of buy­ers with still-healthy job prospects.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong Teck Hui, se­nior di­rec­tor of re­search and consultanc­y at JLL, cited bright spots in the econ­omy where some busi­nesses are sta­ble or even grow­ing. These in­clude the tech­nol­ogy, bio­med­i­cal, health­care, elec­tron­ics and pre­ci­sion engi­neer­ing sec­tors.</p>
    <p>“Those in more sta­ble employment would have greater confidence in pur­chas­ing a prop­erty de­spite the re­ces­sion,” he said.</p>
    <p>The 0.3 per cent in­crease in the Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity’s (URA) sec­ond-quar­ter pri­vate res­i­den­tial price index may have fu­elled the per­cep­tion that prices, at worst, may soften slightly. This may have prompted some home buy­ers to take the plunge, Mr Ong added.</p>
    <p>More new units were launched ahead of the Hun­gry Ghost month, which started on Aug 19. There were 1,582 pri­vate homes launched last month, up 82 per cent from 869 units in July, and nearly 56 per cent higher than 1,015 units a year ago. The fig­ures ex­clude ex­ec­u­tive con­do­minium (EC) units, which are a pub­lic-pri­vate hous­ing hy­brid.</p>
    <p>Last month’s take-up was led by projects in the city fringe, or the rest of cen­tral re­gion, with 622 sales, fol­lowed by 506 units sold in the sub­urbs, or out­side the cen­tral re­gion, and 128 in prime dis­tricts, or the core cen­tral re­gion, ac­cord­ing to JLL.</p>
    <p>The three new launches – Forett At Bukit Timah, Noma and Mooi Res­i­dences – made up 19.1 per cent of to­tal sales last month.</p>
    <p>Forett At Bukit Timah sold 213 units, or 34 per cent of its 633 units, in the first month of its launch, “a rather out­stand­ing per­for­mance, due to the free­hold land ten­ure and com­pet­i­tive price point of $1,933 psf. Ef­fi­cient lay­outs meant that me­dian price quan­tum per unit works out to be $1.45 mil­lion, which fits the sweet spot for most fam­i­lies”, said Ms Tri­cia Song, head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore at Col­liers In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>Noma, a 50-unit free­hold de­vel­op­ment in Gey­lang, sold 34 units, or 68 per cent, within a weekend after it of­fered early-bird dis­counts, with one-bed­ders start­ing at $600,000 and two-bed­room units start­ing at $900,000, Ms Song said.</p>
    <p>In­clud­ing EC units, 1,307 new homes were taken up last month, up 14.4 per cent from July, and about 12 per cent higher than 1,168 a year ago, the URA data showed.</p>
    <p>Sales picked up for ear­lier launches like The Gar­den Res­i­dences and The Woodleigh Res­i­dences – both over­took Jadescape to make the top five best-sell­ing condominiu­ms.</p>
    <p>Ms Song said last month’s sales also showed strong in­ter­est for at­trac­tively priced free­hold city fringe projects. Last month, city fringe projects ac­counted for the bulk of sales at 49.5 per cent, com­pared with 38.8 per cent in July. The sub­urbs, or the proxy for the mass mar­ket seg­ment, made up 40.3 per cent of to­tal sales last month, com­pared with 50.7 per cent in July.</p>
    <p>With the grad­ual re­open­ing of the econ­omy and the set­ting up of fast lanes for essen­tial travel, the num­ber of trans­ac­tions from for­eign buy­ers rose 74 per cent to 54 last month from 31 in July, PropNex chief ex­ec­u­tive Is­mail Gafoor said.</p>
