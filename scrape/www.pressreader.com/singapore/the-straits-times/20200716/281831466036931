    <p>HONG KONG • Hong Kong yes­ter­day con­tin­ued to grap­ple with its worst coro­n­avirus out­break since the pan­demic be­gan, re­port­ing a slew of new cases as the author­i­ties stepped up so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Of the to­tal num­ber of con­firmed cases yes­ter­day, 14 were clas­si­fied as lo­cal and five as im­ported, ac­cord­ing to the city’s health depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Al­though the num­ber of l ocal cases more than halved from Tues­day, that did not in­clude the 37 pa­tients who tested pos­i­tive on a pre­lim­i­nary ba­sis yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among the con­firmed lo­cal cases, the author­i­ties could not trace how half of the peo­ple con­tracted the dis­ease, rais­ing the risk that the virus will con­tinue to spread un­de­tected among peo­ple in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Among those who could not be traced to their sources was a part­time taxi driver as well as a house­wife who lives in Tsz Wan Shan, an area that has been at the cen­tre of a clus­ter of re­cent cases, lo­cal news sta­tion RTHK re­ported.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want any­one to feel like the lo­cal in­fec­tion sit­u­a­tion is eas­ing,” said Dr Chuang Shuk Kwan, an of­fi­cial with the Depart­ment of Health.</p>
    <p>“The num­ber of new lo­cal cases may ac­tu­ally be quite high based on the high pre­lim­i­nary num­ber.”</p>
    <p>The city also saw its ninth coro­n­avirus-re­lated death yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The lat­est fa­tal­ity, a 90-year-old woman, had been in­fected at an el­derly care home in Tsz Wan Shan and is the sec­ond Covid-19-linked death from the care home.</p>
    <p>The lat­est de­vel­op­ments came on the heels of Hong Kong im­ple­ment­ing its strictest suite of so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures as the gov­ern­ment tries to keep the out­break from spi­ralling out of con­trol.</p>
    <p>Up un­til this month, Hong Kong was widely seen as a model of suc­cess in con­tain­ing the virus spread, re­port­ing only 15 cases of lo­cal trans­mis­sion from May to June.</p>
    <p>Start­ing yes­ter­day, bars, gyms and beaches across the city were shut, pub­lic gath­er­ings were lim­ited to four peo­ple, and peo­ple re­fus­ing to wear masks on pub­lic trans­port were to be fined. Din­ing in at restau­rants af­ter 6pm was also pro­hib­ited.</p>
    <p>The author­i­ties have ramped up test­ing for the virus, con­duct­ing more than 10,000 Covid-19 tests a day now, ac­cord­ing to Dr Chuang.</p>
    <p>Pri­or­ity for test­ing would be given to peo­ple ex­hibit­ing symp­toms, those ad­mit­ted to hos­pi­tals, and res­i­dents of build­ings where there have been at least two un­linked cases.</p>
    <p>“In these two weeks, we hope cit­i­zens, es­pe­cially the el­derly, can try their best to stay at home, and go out less to the mar­kets or restau­rants,” Dr Chuang said.</p>
    <p>Not every­one is fol­low­ing the rules.</p>
    <p>A 64-year-old man yes­ter­day be­came the first per­son to face pros­e­cu­tion for vi­o­lat­ing the lat­est re­stric­tions af­ter he re­fused to put on a sur­gi­cal mask on the sub­way, ac­cord­ing to the South China Morn­ing Post.</p>
    <p>The pre­vi­ous day, the news­pa­per re­ported that a 39-year-old vis­i­tor from South Korea on Mon­day tried to es­cape three times from manda­tory quar­an­tine, and even jumped out of a mov­ing ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>The Asian fi­nan­cial hub’s strug­gles il­lus­trate how the coro­n­avirus can roar back even stronger than the ini­tial out­break.</p>
    <p>Else­where, for ex­am­ple, Aus­tralia’s sec­ond-largest city and sev­eral Amer­i­can states have moved to reim­pose lock­down re­stric­tions as new waves of in­fec­tion surge.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s lat­est wave of in­fec­tions be­gan early this month, set­ting daily records for lo­cal cases.</p>
    <p>Since late Jan­uary, the city has recorded more than 1,500 con­firmed cases of Covid-19 in­fec­tion and nine deaths linked to the dis­ease.</p>
