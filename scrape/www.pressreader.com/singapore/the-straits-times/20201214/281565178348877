    <p>New job op­por­tu­ni­ties will be cre­ated in the lead-up to the</p>
    <p>2022 launch of dig­i­tal banks in Sin­ga­pore, with even more po­si­tions cre­ated as they progress to­wards be­com­ing full-func­tion­ing banks, said the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore. The jobs in­clude key roles in lead­er­ship and man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>New job op­por­tu­ni­ties will be cre­ated in the lead-up to the 2022 launch of dig­i­tal banks in Sin­ga­pore, with even more po­si­tions cre­ated as they progress to­wards be­com­ing full-func­tion­ing banks, said the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS).</p>
    <p>The jobs in­clude key roles in lead­er­ship and man­age­ment, and po­si­tions across busi­ness units and func­tions such as sales and marketing, busi­ness de­vel­op­ment, com­pli­ance and hu­man re­sources, Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral bank told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, MAS an­nounced that it will award dig­i­tal full bank li­cences to tech gi­ant Sea and the Grab-Singtel con­sor­tium.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal whole­sale bank li­cences will be awarded to Ant Group and a con­sor­tium com­pris­ing Green­land Fi­nan­cial Hold­ings, Lin­kl­o­gis Hong Kong and Bei­jing Co-op­er­a­tive Eq­uity In­vest­ment Fund Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal banks of­fer re­tail cus­tomers ser­vices such as open­ing ac­counts, ac­cept­ing de­posits and is­su­ing debit and credit cards, but have no phys­i­cal pres­ence, with all bank­ing ser­vices pro­vided on­line.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal whole­sale banks can serve cor­po­rates and small and medium-sized en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>MAS said it ex­pects the dig­i­tal banks to em­ploy a “size­able num­ber of peo­ple”.</p>
    <p>“The num­bers could be smaller in the ini­tial, start­ing years, but as they progress to­wards be­com­ing full-func­tion­ing banks and ex­pand their busi­ness scope over the next few years, we ex­pect their bench strength to grow,” it said.</p>
    <p>“This will add to the over­all jobs cre­ated by the fi­nan­cial ser­vices sec­tor, fur­ther­ing our com­mit­ment to en­sur­ing that this sec­tor cre­ates a fu­ture-ready work­force with a strong Sin­ga­porean core and pro­vides the best op­por­tu­ni­ties for Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank did not give an es­ti­mate of how many new jobs the dig­i­tal banks might cre­ate.</p>
    <p>Hir­ing has al­ready be­gun for at least one of the four dig­i­tal banks.</p>
    <p>Grab-Singtel con­sor­tium chief ex­ec­u­tive Charles Wong told ST that it is look­ing for three groups of tal­ent: bank­ing vet­er­ans with op­er­a­tional ex­per­tise; tal­ent in the fin­tech sec­tor who can iden­tify and bring in­no­va­tive ser­vices to mar­ket; and tech lead­ers well versed in cloud tech­nol­ogy and data.</p>
    <p>They want peo­ple “who have a start-up mind­set, but also a strong sense of the mis­sion ahead of us and a real com­mit­ment to bridg­ing the gaps faced by un­der­served seg­ments in Sin­ga­pore”, he said.</p>
    <p>The con­sor­tium has 200 roles to fill by the end of next year, and has found about 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the staff it needs, fill­ing po­si­tions in data, cy­ber se­cu­rity and tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Op­por­tu­ni­ties will also be cre­ated for Sin­ga­pore­ans to take on tech- and fin­tech-re­lated roles, by train­ing and equip­ping them with the rel­e­vant skills, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sea, which did not re­spond to queries on its ex­pected head­count, has listed on its site at least three job open­ings re­lated to dig­i­tal bank­ing, un­der its dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices arm SeaMoney.</p>
    <p>TECH NEEDED ALL ROUND</p>
    <p>Given the na­ture of dig­i­tal banks, even pro­fes­sions tra­di­tion­ally (re­garded) as ‘non-tech’ will re­quire tech­nol­ogy. Lawyers are one good ex­am­ple. Dig­i­tal banks will re­quire pay­ments coun­sel and data pri­vacy spe­cial­ists with acute knowl­edge of data pro­tec­tion laws and the lat­est tech­nol­ogy in­no­va­tions. ’’</p>
    <p>MR RICHARD BRAD­SHAW, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for re­cruit­ment firm Ethos BeathChap­man in Asia.</p>
    <p>The roles are in fraud risk man­age­ment and credit risk man­age­ment – both re­quir­ing at least six to 12 years’ ex­pe­ri­ence – and for a UI/UX (user in­ter­face/user ex­pe­ri­ence) de­signer with at least one year’s ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Ant Group said it is still in the early stages of set­ting up its dig­i­tal bank, while the con­sor­tium led by Green­land Fi­nan­cial Hold­ings could not be reached.</p>
    <p>Mr Richard Brad­shaw, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for re­cruit­ment firm Ethos BeathChap­man in Asia, said as tech and in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy hires will form the back­bone of the dig­i­tal banks, they will need skills that are not as com­monly found at tra­di­tional banks.</p>
    <p>“Given the na­ture of dig­i­tal banks, even pro­fes­sions tra­di­tion­ally (re­garded) as ‘non-tech’ will re­quire tech­nol­ogy,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Lawyers are one good ex­am­ple. Dig­i­tal banks will re­quire pay­ments coun­sel and data pri­vacy spe­cial­ists with acute knowl­edge of data pro­tec­tion laws and the lat­est tech­nol­ogy in­no­va­tions.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, it has been chal­leng­ing to find the right can­di­dates for these com­pa­nies, as the skills and ex­pe­ri­ences needed are niche and hard to find in an in­creas­ingly skills-short lo­cal tal­ent pool, said Mr Matthieu Im­bert-Bouchard, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at Robert Half Sin­ga­pore, which helped some ap­pli­cants of the new dig­i­tal bank li­cences source can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>“Cur­rently, in­creas­ing dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion across all sec­tors is el­e­vat­ing com­pe­ti­tion for niche skills across all sec­tors, while the un­cer­tain cli­mate (due to Covid-19) means more work­ers than usual will choose to stay loyal to their ex­ist­ing em­ployer,” he said.</p>
    <p>“What’s more, the in­tro­duc­tion of tighter rules for ob­tain­ing (work) passes this year means it’s harder to al­le­vi­ate these short­ages by fill­ing gaps with for­eign tal­ent.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides the right skills, suit­able can­di­dates will also need to have a “roll up the sleeves” at­ti­tude, said Mr Sam Kok Weng, mar­kets and fi­nan­cial ser­vices leader at PwC Sin­ga­pore, which is ad­vis­ing a dig­i­tal bank on its set-up.</p>
    <p>“These peo­ple are prob­lem iden­ti­fiers and solvers – able to of­fer the so­lu­tions, not just re­ceive them,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Brad­shaw said job seek­ers who are keen to join the dig­i­tal banks but are a lit­tle be­hind in ex­pe­ri­ence or skills should ap­ply sooner rather than later to pen­e­trate the in­dus­try early, and up­grade them­selves by tak­ing skills cour­ses with the help of govern­ment sub­si­dies.</p>
    <p>MAS said it has been work­ing with its tri­par­tite part­ners to build a pipe­line of fi­nan­cial pro­fes­sion­als and help them gain ex­pe­ri­ence in new tech ar­eas, but the dig­i­tal banks must play their part too.</p>
    <p>“MAS will work closely with the dig­i­tal banks to en­sure they put in place poli­cies, pro­cesses and ini­tia­tives to build up their lo­cal tal­ent pool and pipe­line,” it said.</p>
