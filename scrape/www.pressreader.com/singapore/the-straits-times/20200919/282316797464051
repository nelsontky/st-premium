    <p>ROME Swedish pole vault star Ar­mand Du­plan­tis con­tin­ued his re­mark­able, un­beaten sea­son af­ter eclips­ing Ukrainian leg­end Sergey Bubka’s 26-year mark, set­ting a new out­door world record of 6.15m at the Di­a­mond League meet in Rome on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Du­plan­tis, who al­ready holds the world in­door record of 6.18m, bet­tered the mark of 6.14m achieved by Bubka in July 1994 in Italy.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old suc­ceeded on his sec­ond at­tempt in a com­pe­ti­tion he dom­i­nated in per­fect warm and wind­less con­di­tions, but with­out spec­ta­tors to cel­e­brate in an empty Olympic Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>“I think I’m still up in the clouds right now,” said the US-born ath­lete, who has won all 15 meets he has com­peted in this sea­son. “It’s a sur­real, su­per crazy feel­ing.”</p>
    <p>He set the world record in­doors in Glas­gow in Fe­bru­ary, and had made the out­door mark his goal, with the Olympic Games and Euro­pean Cham­pi­onships post­poned be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“There’s a lot of con­fu­sion be­cause the pole vault is the only event which has one world record for both in­doors and out­doors,” said Du­plan­tis.</p>
    <p>“I wanted the out­door world best at 6.15 so there would no longer be any con­fu­sion.</p>
    <p>“I now have the best jumps in­doors and out­doors.”</p>
    <p>He had cleared an ear­lier at­tempt but hit the bar on the way down.</p>
    <p>“It was a kind of men­tal thing,” he said. “Af­ter that first at­tempt, I knew what I had to do, so just went out and did it.”</p>
    <p>The son of an Amer­i­can pole vaulter who grew up with a pole vault pit in his gar­den at home in Louisiana, he was vault­ing higher than a Lon­don dou­ble-decker bus as a teenager and at 17, he had al­ready cleared 5.90m.</p>
    <p>There were also im­pres­sive per­for­mances on the track with two world lead times.</p>
    <p>Elaine Thomp­son-Herah ran the fastest time this year as the Ja­maican de­mol­ished the field to win the women’s 100 me­tres in 10.85 sec­onds. Amer­i­can Aleia Hobbs was a dis­tant sec­ond and Ivo­rian Marie-Jose Ta Lou third.</p>
    <p>Ja­cob Ki­plimo also pro­duced a world lead­ing time to win the men’s 3,000m ahead of Jakob Inge­brigt­sen in 7min 26.64sec. It was also a Ugan­dan and Di­a­mond League record.</p>
    <p>But Nor­we­gian Karsten Warholm missed out on the 400m hur­dles world record, de­spite win­ning in a blis­ter­ing 47.07sec.</p>
    <p>Two-time world cham­pion Warholm, the sec­ond-fastest 400m hur­dler in his­tory, had been hop­ing to top­ple Kevin Young’s long-stand­ing mark of 46.78sec which the Amer­i­can set at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.</p>
