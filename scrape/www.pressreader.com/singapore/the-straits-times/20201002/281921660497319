    <p>UNITED NA­TIONS (United States) • World lead­ers pledged to take ur­gent ac­tion over the next 10 years to put na­ture on a path to re­cov­ery by 2030 as risks to plant and an­i­mal life and frag­ile ecosys­tems in­crease by the year.</p>
    <p>More than 100 heads of state and govern­ment ad­dressed the one­day vir­tual United Na­tions Biodiversi­ty Sum­mit on Wed­nes­day. They called for more ac­tion and bold steps to pre­serve na­ture and to avoid cli­mate col­lapse.</p>
    <p>“Hu­man­ity is wag­ing war on na­ture. We need to change our re­la­tion­ship with it,” United Na­tions Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral An­to­nio Guter­res said in his open­ing speech. “Degra­da­tion of na­ture is not purely an en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sue. It spans eco­nomics, health, so­cial jus­tice and hu­man rights.”</p>
    <p>At least one mil­lion species are cur­rently threat­ened or in dan­ger of dis­ap­pear­ing. Mean­while, a UN re­port last month out­lined the world’s fail­ure to fully achieve any of the 2020 biodiversi­ty tar­gets set dur­ing a land­mark con­fer­ence in Aichi, Ja­pan, a decade ago.</p>
    <p>“The loss of biodiversi­ty and the degra­da­tion of the ecosys­tem pose a ma­jor risk to hu­man sur­vival and de­vel­op­ment,” China’s Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said. “Covid-19 re­minds us of the in­ter­de­pen­dence be­tween man and na­ture. It falls to all of us to act to­gether and ur­gently to ad­vance pro­tec­tion and de­vel­op­ment in par­al­lel,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi sur­prised world lead­ers last week when he an­nounced his coun­try would go car­bon neu­tral by 2060. On Wed­nes­day, he de­fended the “UN-cen­tred in­ter­na­tional sys­tem” and the Paris cli­mate ac­cord, in what ap­peared to be a swipe at the United States, which is set to leave the land­mark agree­ment.</p>
    <p>China is key to global cli­mate ac­tion, and will host the Con­fer­ence of Par­ties UN Biodiversi­ty Con­fer­ence next May in Kun­ming, where nearly 200 coun­tries will ne­go­ti­ate a new agree­ment on pro­tect­ing na­ture.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, more than 60 coun­tries com­mit­ted to 10 ac­tions to re­verse the loss of biodiversi­ty by 2030, in­clud­ing in­te­grat­ing na­ture pro­tec­tion into Covid-19 re­cov­ery plans, in­creas­ing fi­nanc­ing to pro­tect the nat­u­ral world, and clamp­ing down on ma­rine pol­lu­tion and de­for­esta­tion.</p>
    <p>The pledge was signed by the EU, Mex­ico, Bangladesh, Ger­many, Nor­way, Canada and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>No­table ab­sences were Brazil and In­done­sia – two hot spots of de­for­esta­tion – and China and the United States, the world’s top two emit­ters of green­house gases.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain and Canada on Mon­day also joined the Euro­pean Union in pledg­ing to pro­tect 30 per cent of their land and seas by 2030 to stem “cat­a­strophic” biodiversi­ty loss and help gal­vanise sup­port for broader agree­ment on the tar­get ahead of the Kun­ming meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Sci­en­tists have said a min­i­mum of 30 per cent of the planet must be safe­guarded, through pro­tected ar­eas and con­ser­va­tion. A draft of the Kun­ming agree­ment in­cludes this pledge.</p>
    <p>Without ac­tion, 30 to 50 per cent of all species could be lost by 2050, threat­en­ing eco­nomic and so­cial pros­per­ity, a re­port by The Na­ture Con­ser­vancy char­ity last month said. For ex­am­ple, los­ing bees and other pol­li­na­tors could cause a drop in an­nual agri­cul­tural out­put worth US$217 bil­lion (S$296 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Yet, sci­en­tists and con­ser­va­tion­ists have long strug­gled to get govern­ments and com­pany board­rooms to un­der­stand the fi­nan­cial costs of dam­age to na­ture and the risks to economies. Con­ser­va­tion groups say govern­ments and busi­nesses must dra­mat­i­cally step up fi­nanc­ing to halt the de­struc­tion of forests, man­groves, grass­lands and pol­lu­tion of rivers and oceans.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish broad­caster David At­ten­bor­ough on Wed­nes­day led a cam­paign by con­ser­va­tion groups for the world to in­vest US$500 bil­lion a year to halt the de­struc­tion of na­ture. “Our nat­u­ral world is un­der greater pres­sure now than at any time in hu­man his­tory, and the fu­ture of the en­tire planet – on which ev­ery sin­gle one of us de­pends – is in grave jeop­ardy.”</p>
    <p>Hu­man­ity is wag­ing war on na­ture. We need to change our re­la­tion­ship with it... Degra­da­tion of na­ture is not purely an en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sue. It spans eco­nomics, health, so­cial jus­tice and hu­man rights.</p>
