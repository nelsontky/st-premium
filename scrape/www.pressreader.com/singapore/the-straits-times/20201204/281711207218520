    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has re­leased a 46-minute video­taped speech in which he de­nounces what he called a “rigged” elec­tion, a day af­ter his own at­tor­ney-gen­eral joined elec­tion of­fi­cials across the coun­try in at­test­ing to his de­feat.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump recorded what he said “may be the most i mpor­tant speech I’ve ever made” in the Diplo­matic Room of the White House on Wed­nes­day, de­liv­er­ing it be­hind a lectern with the pres­i­den­tial seal. He then posted a two-minute ver­sion on Twit­ter, with a link to the full ver­sion on his Face­book page.</p>
    <p>He once again re­fused to con­cede de­feat in his bid for re-elec­tion a month af­ter polling day, re­peat­ing a long list of as­ser­tions about voter fraud and ac­cus­ing Democrats of a con­spir­acy to steal the pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter quickly la­belled the post “dis­puted”, while Face­book added a note to say that Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, who re­ceived al­most 81 mil­lion votes and 306 elec­toral votes, is the pro­jected win­ner of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The video, which a White House of­fi­cial said was recorded last week, was the in-per­son em­bod­i­ment of Mr Trump’s stac­cato tweets over the past three weeks about vot­ing ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties in swing states, at­tacks on state of­fi­cials and sig­na­ture ver­i­fi­ca­tions, and ac­cu­sa­tions against Democrats.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s as­ser­tions in the video were dras­ti­cally un­der­cut on Tues­day, when At­tor­ney-Gen­eral Wil­liam Barr told The As­so­ci­ated Press that de­spite in­quiries by the Jus­tice Depart­ment and the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion, “to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have ef­fected a dif­fer­ent out­come in the elec­tion”.</p>
    <p>At the end of the video, Mr Trump de­scribed him­self as the de­fender of Amer­ica’s elec­tion sys­tem, say­ing he had been told that the sin­gle most im­por­tant ac­com­plish­ment of his pres­i­dency would be pro­tect­ing the in­tegrity of the vot­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>It was un­clear why Mr Trump waited un­til Wed­nes­day to re­lease the video. But he made it pub­lic af­ter a series of re­bukes by mem­bers of his own party, who have in­creas­ingly aban­doned him as he re­fuses to ac­knowl­edge the re­sults of the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent’s le­gal team, led by his per­sonal lawyer, Mr Rudy Gi­u­liani, has lost dozens of law­suits in courts across the coun­try while mak­ing wild al­le­ga­tions with­out any proof to back them up.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump him­self has re­mained shut­tered in the White House since the elec­tion, lim­it­ing his pub­lic ap­pear­ances and ap­par­ently hold­ing few of­fi­cial meet­ings.</p>
    <p>But ac­cord­ing to me­dia re­ports, he is pre­par­ing his exit, hold­ing dis­cus­sions about is­su­ing pre­emp­tive par­dons for his three adult chil­dren – Don­ald Jr, Eric and Ivanka – and for Ivanka’s hus­band Jared Kush­ner, as well as his per­sonal lawyer Rudy Gi­u­liani.</p>
    <p>Some of the Pres­i­dent’s key Repub­li­can al­lies on Capi­tol Hill and else­where have urged him to move on in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>Mr Mitch McCon­nell, a Ken­tucky Repub­li­can and the Se­nate ma­jor­ity leader, who has been con­spic­u­ously silent about Mr Trump’s claims, fi­nally re­ferred this week to the “new ad­min­is­tra­tion” that would be tak­ing over next year, a clear sig­nal to Mr Trump that his time in of­fice was com­ing to an end.</p>
    <p>The real es­tate ty­coon faces the chal­lenge of los­ing the cen­tre of at­ten­tion, and his grip on the Repub­li­can Party, as Wash­ing­ton turns to the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>But Mr Trump re­tains the sup­port of a core group of vot­ers who quickly re­sponded to his lat­est attack on the elec­tion. Within a few hours, his tweet had been “liked” by al­most 134,000 Twit­ter users and his Face­book video had been shared 93,000 times.</p>
    <p>The en­dur­ing sup­port may be one of the rea­sons that Mr Trump is openly mus­ing about a sec­ond run at the US pres­i­dency in 2024, sug­gest­ing at a White House Christ­mas party on Tues­day that he might have lost this bat­tle, but would not re­tire qui­etly as a oneterm pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“It’s been an amaz­ing four years. We are try­ing to do an­other four years. Oth­er­wise, I’ll see you in four years,” he told guests.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to NBC News, Mr Trump has dis­cussed with his close aides the pos­si­bil­ity of launch­ing his 2024 cam­paign on Jan 20, the day Mr Bi­den is to be in­au­gu­rated as pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>In the­ory, noth­ing pre­vents an­other run. The US Con­sti­tu­tion re­stricts pres­i­dents to two four-year terms, but does not re­quire that they be con­sec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>But only one pres­i­dent has done so: Grover Cleve­land, in the late 19th cen­tury.</p>
