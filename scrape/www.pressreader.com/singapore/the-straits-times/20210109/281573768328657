    <p>Guests at the Crowne Plaza Changi Air­port who wish to can­cel their book­ings can do so at no charge, the ho­tel said af­ter two Covid-19 cases among its staff forced it to close for two weeks.</p>
    <p>Those with pre-paid reser­va­tions will re­ceive a full re­fund, it said in a state­ment to The Straits Times. They will also be given the op­tion of stay­ing in an­other ho­tel un­der its par­ent, the In­ter­Con­ti­nen­tal Ho­tels Group (IHG).</p>
    <p>A third linked case was con­firmed by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day, with a spe­cial op­er­a­tion un­der way to test 234 staff working at the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The lat­est case is a 20-year-old Sin­ga­porean who works at Azur, a restau­rant in Crowne Plaza Changi Air­port. The man was iden­ti­fied as a close con­tact of the first case at the ho­tel, and quar­an­tined on Tues­day. He de­vel­oped symp­toms on Thurs­day, was swabbed and found in pre­lim­i­nary tests to be pos­i­tive for the more in­fec­tious B117 strain.</p>
    <p>MOH said that of the 233 ho­tel staff who have been swabbed, 129 test re­sults have come back neg­a­tive. The rest are pend­ing.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel said its cur­rent guests will be given the op­tion to move. A spokesman said: “If they pre­fer to check out be­fore the end of their stay, they will be com­pen­sated ac­cord­ingly.” She de­clined to say how many guests were af­fected.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel was closed for two weeks start­ing yes­ter­day as a pre­cau­tion fol­low­ing the sec­ond case an­nounced by MOH on Thurs­day. That pa­tient is a 43-year-old Malaysian woman who de­liv­ers pre-packed meals to air crew and ho­tel guests, and works at Azur. She is the sec­ond staff mem­ber at the restau­rant to test pos­i­tive fol­low­ing a Korean man on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>None of the three cases came into con­tact with din­ers.</p>
    <p>The ho­tel has stopped ac­cept­ing new guests. For­eign air crew and guests cur­rently stay­ing there will be checked out pro­gres­sively. In­com­ing air crew will be housed at al­ter­na­tive fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Those who have booked rooms us­ing Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers will be given the op­tion of post­pon­ing their stay or mov­ing to an­other IHG ho­tel in the city. The spokesman said that restau­rant and event spa­ces will be closed, and deep clean­ing is un­der way.</p>
    <p>MOH said it was in­ves­ti­gat­ing the three cases, and could not ex­clude the pos­si­bil­ity that trans­mis­sions oc­curred at the ho­tel, which was eerily quiet when ST vis­ited yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Guest Lee Jia Yi, 24, told ST she de­cided to check out ear­lier af­ter learn­ing of the sec­ond case. She had been stay­ing at the ho­tel with two friends to cel­e­brate a birthday.</p>
    <p>She said: “We were a lit­tle con­cerned when we knew about the first case on the day that we checked in. We found out about the sec­ond case on Thurs­day night through the news and got a lit­tle more wor­ried.”</p>
