    <p>Re­sale prices of Hous­ing Board flats rose in the third quar­ter of this year, with the re­sale price in­dex reach­ing 133.7, said HDB yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This is an in­crease of 1.4 per cent from the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Last quar­ter’s per­for­mance also marked a sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ment from the pre­vi­ous quar­ters.</p>
    <p>The re­sale price in­dex had risen by a mar­ginal 0.3 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter af­ter stay­ing flat in the first quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>OrangeTee & Tie head of re­search and con­sul­tancy Chris­tine Sun said the HDB re­sale mar­ket has “out­per­formed” ex­pec­ta­tions in the past three months.</p>
    <p>She noted that stim­u­lus mea­sures and past prop­erty curbs may have played an in­stru­men­tal role in keep­ing home prices up amid the cur­rent eco­nomic head­winds.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, cool­ing mea­sures – such as the mort­gage ser­vic­ing ra­tio – were ap­plied to tighten the dis­burse­ment of hous­ing loans.</p>
    <p>This may have pre­vented buy­ers from over­lever­ag­ing and sell­ing their flats at ex­ces­sively low prices dur­ing the cur­rent mar­ket slow­down, Ms Sun said.</p>
    <p>“Fears of a prop­erty melt­down amid Sin­ga­pore’s worst eco­nomic cri­sis were abated as the pub­lic hous­ing mar­ket per­for­mance emerged stronger than ex­pected last quar­ter,” she added.</p>
    <p>The ro­bust i ncrease i n re­sale prices could also be due to the long com­ple­tion pe­riod for some re­cent Build-To-Or­der (BTO) launches.</p>
    <p>This may have led some buy­ers to switch to the re­sale mar­ket, said Ms Sun.</p>
    <p>HDB will re­lease the fi­nal fig­ures, with more de­tailed pub­lic hous­ing data, on Oct 23.</p>
    <p>About 9,300 BTO flats will be on of­fer next month and in Fe­bru­ary next year, HDB said.</p>
    <p>These flats will be avail­able in var­i­ous es­tates and more in­for­ma­tion on them will be found on the HDB In­foWeb.</p>
    <p>“Bar­ring any un­fore­seen cir­cum­stances, the next Sale of Bal­ance Flats ex­er­cise is also sched­uled to be launched in Novem­ber 2020, to­gether with the BTO ex­er­cise,” said HDB.</p>
    <p>All un­sold BTO flats are of­fered through Sale of Bal­ance Flats ex­er­cises. Those that re­main un­s­e­lected are di­rectly of­fered for open book­ing.</p>
    <p>Novem­ber’s Sale of Bal­ance Flats ex­er­cise, which usu­ally takes place twice a year, is the first to oc­cur this year. The pre­vi­ous ex­er­cise was de­ferred be­cause of Covid-19.</p>
