    <p>Clubs are now lim­ited to sign­ing six over­seas play­ers un­der 21 in a year, and only three in Jan­uary. Most sig­nif­i­cantly, they are now barred from re­cruit­ing for­eign­ers un­der 18.</p>
    <p>That will come as a re­lief to Euro­pean clubs who ob­jected to hav­ing their best prospects poached by English ri­vals.</p>
    <p>Brexit, Jur­gen Klopp said in 2018, “makes no sense at all”.</p>
    <p>His views have not changed. Last month, he said he was still wait­ing to see any ben­e­fits from the United King­dom’s exit from the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>Many in the Premier League op­posed it, but if any man­ager should have a par­tic­u­lar complaint, it ought to be Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer.</p>
    <p>Un­der new rules, which come into ef­fect to­day, Manch­ester United would not have been able to ap­point him.</p>
    <p>A points-based sys­tem is be­ing in­tro­duced for play­ers and man­agers from EU coun­tries.</p>
    <p>An over­seas man­ager needs to have worked in one of the world’s 33 ma­jor leagues for at least three of the previous five years to qual­ify. Sol­sk­jaer, af­ter man­ag­ing Molde in his na­tive Nor­way, would not have qual­i­fied.</p>
    <p>In­stead, a per­mit is re­quired. They will be al­lo­cated to play­ers or man­agers who reach 15 points on a new scheme; those who get 10-14 can have their case heard by an ap­peals panel.</p>
    <p>Points are granted on ba­sis of a club’s fin­ish­ing po­si­tion in the league, plus se­nior and ju­nior in­ter­na­tional ap­pear­ances.</p>
    <p>Leagues are placed into six tiers; ap­pear­ing in the best – French, Ger­man, Ital­ian and Span­ish top flights, plus the Cham­pi­ons League and the Copa Lib­er­ta­dores – earns most points, along with caps for coun­tries ranked high­est.</p>
    <p>At the risk of sim­pli­fy­ing it, any first-team player from the other four ma­jor Euro­pean leagues would prob­a­bly qual­ify; so, too, any reg­u­lar for a na­tional side ranked in the top 50.</p>
    <p>That can ben­e­fit play­ers from non-EU coun­tries, who were pre­vi­ously dis­ad­van­taged, if they play for cer­tain coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Broadly, Premier League first-team trans­fer strate­gies should be largely un­af­fected.</p>
    <p>Where they need a rethink, how­ever, is in ju­nior re­cruit­ment.</p>
    <p>Clubs are now lim­ited to sign­ing six over­seas play­ers un­der 21 in a year, and only three in Jan­uary. Most sig­nif­i­cantly, they are now barred from re­cruit­ing for­eign­ers un­der 18.</p>
    <p>That will come as a re­lief to Euro­pean clubs who ob­jected to hav­ing their best prospects poached by English ri­vals, such as when Arse­nal plucked a teenage Cesc Fabre­gas from Barcelona’s academy. Oth­ers who would not have been able to join as kids in­clude Ni­co­las Anelka, Hector Bel­lerin (Arse­nal), Ger­ard Pique (United), Eric Gar­cia (Manch­ester City).</p>
    <p>But Premier League clubs now have 86 EU teenagers on their books.</p>
    <p>This will af­fect Chelsea and City’s cos­mopoli­tan youth re­cruit­ment, which has proved a prof­itable busi­ness model for both clubs.</p>
    <p>But City, in par­tic­u­lar, may be able to cir­cum­vent the rules with their global em­pire of clubs. They can buy them for oth­ers and wait un­til they reach the 15-point thresh­old be­fore mov­ing them to Eng­land.</p>
    <p>This could lead to more tie-ins with for­eign clubs.</p>
    <p>The Premier League might not get more English, but the Cham­pi­onship could. Its savvier buy­ers, like Nor­wich and</p>
    <p>Brent­ford, have raided for­eign mar­kets well, but many of their sign­ings from EU coun­tries – in­clud­ing pro­lific scor­ers like Teemu Pukki and Neal Mau­pay – would not have qual­i­fied for a per­mit. And nor, to back­date rules, would Riyad Mahrez when Le­ices­ter bought him. N’Golo Kante would have needed an ap­peal, too.</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter’s ti­tle, the most im­prob­a­ble Premier League win ever, might have been im­pos­si­ble un­der the new rules.</p>
