    <p>The next three to six weeks at min­i­mum ... are our Covid weeks. It won’t end af­ter that, but that is the pe­riod right now where we could have a surge upon a surge upon a surge.</p>
    <p>DR MICHAEL OSTERHOLM, a mem­ber of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den’s coro­n­avirus ad­vi­sory board, to CNN. He stressed that it would be sev­eral months be­fore the na­tion sees wide­spread avail­abil­ity of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON The US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) said yes­ter­day it was work­ing rapidly to is­sue an emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vac­cine, with the first Amer­i­cans set to be im­mu­nised as early as Mon­day or Tues­day.</p>
    <p>De­part­ment of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Sec­re­tary Alex Azar said reg­u­la­tory au­tho­ri­sa­tion should come within days.</p>
    <p>The agency has also no­ti­fied the Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion and Oper­a­tion Warp Speed so that they can ex­e­cute their plans for timely vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion, it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>A panel of out­side ad­vis­ers to the FDA voted over­whelm­ingly to en­dorse emer­gency use of Pfizer’s coro­n­avirus vac­cine on Thurs­day, paving the way for the agency to au­tho­rise the shot for a na­tion that has lost more than 290,000 lives to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee had voted 17 to four that the known ben­e­fits of the Covid-19 vac­cine out­weighed the risks of tak­ing the shot for in­di­vid­u­als aged 16 and older, with one mem­ber of the panel ab­stain­ing.</p>
    <p>“This is a his­toric mo­ment,” Dr Eric Dick­son, chief ex­ec­u­tive of UMass Me­mo­rial Health Care, who was not on the ad­vi­sory panel, said af­ter the vote.</p>
    <p>He called the vac­cine from Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech “the best so­lu­tion to get us out of our cur­rent sit­u­a­tion and help us save lives”.</p>
    <p>Pfizer had asked that the two­dose vac­cine be ap­proved for use by peo­ple aged be­tween 16 and 85.</p>
    <p>Health­care work­ers, first re­spon­ders and nurs­ing home res­i­dents are ex­pected to re­ceive the first doses.</p>
    <p>Prepa­ra­tions for the vac­cine roll­out were in full swing.</p>
    <p>De­liv­ery gi­ants United Par­cel Ser­vice and FedEx are on stand-by to ship mil­lions of doses to dis­tri­bu­tion stag­ing ar­eas un­der con­tract with the fed­eral gov­ern­ment, giv­ing top pri­or­ity to the vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The Pfizer vac­cines re­quire stor­age in ul­tra-cold freezer units and must be pre­pared for in­jec­tion and given quickly once thawed, pos­ing spe­cial chal­lenges to med­i­cal au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In spite of th­ese lat­est moves to­wards US gov­ern­ment ap­proval of a vac­cine, a top coro­n­avirus ad­viser to Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den de­liv­ered a stern hol­i­day mes­sage to Amer­i­cans on Thurs­day – “no Christ­mas par­ties” – and warned that they face a Covid-19 siege for weeks to come.</p>
    <p>“The next three to six weeks at min­i­mum... are our Covid weeks,” Dr Michael Osterholm, a mem­ber of Mr Bi­den’s coro­n­avirus ad­vi­sory board, told CNN.</p>
    <p>“It won’t end af­ter that, but that is the pe­riod right now where we could have a surge upon a surge upon a surge.”</p>
    <p>Dr Osterholm stressed that it would be sev­eral months be­fore the na­tion sees wide­spread avail­abil­ity of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>He said size­able quan­ti­ties of vac­cines would not be avail­able to the pub­lic at large be­fore March or April.</p>
    <p>Dr Osterholm’s ad­mo­ni­tion came as coro­n­avirus caseloads soared, strain­ing health­care sys­tems in cities and small towns across the coun­try.</p>
    <p>He urged Amer­i­cans to do their ut­most to slow the con­ta­gion by lim­it­ing so­cial in­ter­ac­tions to mem­bers of their im­me­di­ate house­holds, and above all: “No Christ­mas par­ties.”</p>
    <p>He added: “There is not a safe Christ­mas party in this coun­try right now.”</p>
