    <p>The on­go­ing pan­demic has left global economies in a state of flux, with fi­nan­cial mar­kets seem­ingly dis­con­nected from eco­nomic re­al­ity. As such, in­vestors should stay calm and seize this op­por­tu­nity to cal­i­brate their fi­nan­cial knowl­edge, in­vest­ments and fi­nan­cial ac­tiv­i­ties on­line.</p>
    <p>This was the main mes­sage by ex­perts from fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions and in­dus­try prac­ti­tion­ers, the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity, and the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force (SPF), in the re­cent My Money we­bi­nar se­ries.</p>
    <p>The we­bi­nars were or­gan­ised by MoneySense, the As­so­ci­a­tion of Banks in Sin­ga­pore and Securities In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore), and are avail­able on var­i­ous MoneySense on­line plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Man­age your money</p>
    <p>STEP 1 : Relook fi­nan­cial habits</p>
    <p>Ex­perts in one we­bi­nar fo­cused on how par­tic­i­pants can bet­ter plan their fi­nances. Ms Chuin Ting We­ber, chief ex­ec­u­tive of fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sor MoneyOwl, said short-term fi­nan­cial plan­ning is one thing they can con­trol, rather than the mar­kets, in a cri­sis. She stressed: “Short-term eco­nomic data is not meant to change our long-term in­vest­ment strate­gies, but for us to take stock of our fi­nan­cial plan­ning de­ci­sions”.</p>
    <p>Sound de­ci­sions in­clude bud­get­ing to strengthen fi­nan­cial po­si­tions, and her strate­gies in­clude re­struc­tur­ing in­sur­ance and con­sump­tion habits, elim­i­nat­ing ex­penses, and use­ful frame­works for mak­ing fi­nan­cial de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>STEP 2 : Re­view cur­rent com­mit­ments Apart from im­prov­ing fi­nan­cial habits, cash-strapped con­sumers should first con­sider other op­tions such as re­fi­nanc­ing, if they are out of the lock-in pe­riod of their mort­gages for ex­am­ple. Pay­ment de­fer­ral and other re­lief mea­sures should be the last op­tion as they are not with­out cost.</p>
    <p>Bor­row­ers can ap­proach their fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to dis­cuss de­fer­ring re­pay­ments for se­cured or in­sur­ance pre­mi­ums.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, con­sumers strug­gling with home loan re­pay­ments may de­fer the prin­ci­pal pay­ment. As in­ter­est will con­tinue to be charged on the de­ferred prin­ci­pal amount, bor­row­ers should be aware that they will pay more in­ter­est in to­tal if they choose to de­fer pay­ments and ex­tend their loan ten­ure.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers who have lost at least 25 per cent of their monthly in­come after 1 Feb 2020, may con­vert credit card and un­se­cured bal­ances to term loans. The in­ter­est rate will be up to 8 per cent a year, with a ten­ure of up to five years, among other con­di­tions. Pay­ments for cer­tain un­se­cured loans like study loans may be de­ferred too.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers were also warned against get­ting new loans, and use a de­ci­sion-mak­ing frame­work called PAO - pur­pose, af­ford­abil­ity, and op­tions - to de­ter­mine if they need one, said Ms Tan Huey Min, gen­eral man­ager of Credit Coun­selling Sin­ga­pore (CCS).</p>
    <p>Pur­pose in­volves de­ter­min­ing the rea­sons be­hind ap­ply­ing for an in­stal­ment plan; af­ford­abil­ity re­quires the abil­ity to “ser­vice the monthly re­pay­ments”, and ex­plore all op­tions, Ms Tan noted.</p>
    <p>If bor­row­ers fur­ther find them­selves in a bind with un­se­cured loans, CCS can as­sist with ap­ply­ing for a Debt Con­sol­i­da­tion Plan with banks.</p>
    <p>With these fi­nan­cial plan­ning strate­gies to pro­tect fi­nances, in­vestors can con­cen­trate on mak­ing bet­ter in­vest­ment de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Man­age your in­vest­ments</p>
    <p>In an­other sem­i­nar fo­cus­ing on in­vest­ing, the main take­aways were not to time the mar­ket in the short-term but to in­vest for the long-term, in­vest in prod­ucts one un­der­stands, and di­ver­sify port­fo­lios.</p>
    <p>This ap­plies to all as­set classes, in­clud­ing ex­change-traded funds (ETFs) and real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (reits). Mr Chia Nam Toon, chair­man of education and re­search at REIT As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore, re­minded the au­di­ence to use long-term fi­nan­cial met­rics, and have a “diver­si­fied port­fo­lio of reits, shares, or any other in­vest­ment in­stru­ments”.</p>
    <p>For in­vestors look­ing at ETFs, Mr Calvin Neo, Nikko AM’s ETF busi­ness de­vel­op­ment spe­cial­ist, noted ETFs have “sig­nif­i­cantly lower fees and ex­penses than unit trusts”, and of­fer trans­parency and ac­ces­si­bil­ity to mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts also noted that to­day, mar­kets ap­pear dis­con­nected from eco­nomic re­al­ity. For in­stance, Mr Vasu Menon, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of in­vest­ment strat­egy, at OCBC Bank’s wealth man­age­ment unit, said: “Gold has been a star per­former (with prices ris­ing some 29 per cent since Jan­uary), while tech stocks rose some 30 per cent, and bond mar­kets six per cent or so.” This is in stark con­trast with the per­for­mance of economies world­wide, some of which have had a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions, which could af­fect their re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Stay dig­i­tally safe</p>
    <p>With the ac­cel­er­ated use of con­tact­less e-pay­ments as so­cial dis­tanc­ing con­tin­ues, in­vestors should be more dig­i­tally vig­i­lant in pro­tect­ing their as­sets.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers should also be wary of loan scams, or un­li­censed money­len­ders so­lic­it­ing loans via SMS, What­sApp texts, and phone calls.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to an ar­ti­cle in The Straits Times on Aug 26, 2020, $82 mil­lion was lost through scams in­clud­ing e-com­merce and bank­ing-re­lated phish­ing scams.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the MyMoney 2020 we­bi­nar, Ms Carolyn Misir, prin­ci­pal psy­chol­o­gist at the oper­a­tions and foren­sic branch of the Po­lice Psy­cho­log­i­cal Ser­vices Di­vi­sion, said scam­mers use six typ­i­cal per­sua­sion tech­niques on vic­tims. For in­stance, in what is known as China of­fi­cial im­per­son­ation scams, one com­mon tech­nique is pro­ject­ing the il­lu­sion of au­thor­ity, where the scam­mer threat­ens to freeze bank ac­counts or ar­rest vic­tims.</p>
