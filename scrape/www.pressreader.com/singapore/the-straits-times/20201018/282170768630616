    <p>Gareth Bale is ex­pected to make his sec­ond Tot­ten­ham de­but against West Ham in the Premier League to­day, but Jose Mour­inho claims even the Welsh star’s place is not guar­an­teed as he rev­els in the squad depth at his dis­posal.</p>
    <p>Bale has re­turned to north Lon­don on a sea­son-long loan from Real Madrid af­ter seven years of highs and lows since join­ing the</p>
    <p>Span­ish giants for a then worl­drecord fee.</p>
    <p>He scored in two Cham­pi­ons League fi­nals as Real won the com­pe­ti­tion four times in his first five sea­sons. But his per­for­mances also at­tracted plenty of crit­i­cism, while he strug­gled with in­juries and adapt­ing to life in Spain.</p>
    <p>In­jury has also de­layed his Tot­ten­ham re­turn on the field, but the fa­mil­iar sur­round­ings have made the 31-year-old more re­laxed af­ter his Madrid mis­ery and he has been pic­tured in the stands sup­port­ing his new team­mates.</p>
    <p>Mour­inho said on Fri­day that Sergio Reguilon, who also moved from Real to Spurs last month, com­mented that Bale looks a “dif­fer­ent guy” from the shy fig­ure in the Span­ish cap­i­tal. But ques­tions re­main over whether he can em­u­late the suc­cess of his first spell with Tot­ten­ham, when he de­vel­oped into one of the world’s best.</p>
    <p>In the fi­nal sea­son be­fore his big move, Bale scored 26 goals but it still was not enough to se­cure a place in the Cham­pi­ons League as Spurs fin­ished fifth.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his time in Spain, Tot­ten­ham be­came Cham­pi­ons League reg­u­lars, reach­ing the fi­nal for the first time last year.</p>
    <p>This sea­son is the first in five years they are not in Europe’s top club com­pe­ti­tion, but a Cham­pi­ons League re­turn is the least they ex­pect af­ter bring­ing back Bale to form a po­ten­tially thrilling front three along­side Harry Kane and Son He­ung-min.</p>
    <p>Kane and Son have com­bined spec­tac­u­larly to thrash Manch­ester United 6-1 and Southampto­n 5-2 al­ready this sea­son.</p>
    <p>In­juries to both ham­pered Spurs’ chances of mak­ing the top four last sea­son but Mour­inho is con­fi­dent he now has the squad to chal­lenge on mul­ti­ple fronts.</p>
    <p>“We have a squad where ev­ery player has to fight a lot and play very well to de­serve a place in the team,” said the Spurs boss.</p>
    <p>“The squad is so good, so strong. We have so many op­tions that I refuse to say this player is a first choice. I can feel even in the play­ers this feel­ing I love. They are happy but they are wor­ried.</p>
    <p>“They are happy that the squad is good, that peo­ple are com­ing to make the squad bet­ter. But at the same time they are wor­ried about them­selves, ‘am I go­ing to play or not go­ing to play?’ This is the kind of feel­ing you have in the top teams and we are hav­ing that now.”</p>
    <p>Mour­inho con­firmed that Kane will start the game, with his new un­der­study Car­los Vini­cius on the bench. The Brazil­ian was a new ar­rival along with Bale, Reguilon, Pierre-Emile Ho­jb­jerg, Matt Do­herty and Joe Hart.</p>
    <p>Tot­ten­ham also an­nounced on Fri­day that they have com­pleted the sign­ing of Wales cen­tre-back Joe Rodon from Swansea City on a five-year deal and will pay an ini­tial fee of £11 mil­lion (S$19.3 mil­lion) for the 22-year-old de­fender.</p>
