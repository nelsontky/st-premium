    <p>Euro­pean Union lead­ers will dis­cuss prepa­ra­tions for the po­ten­tial col­lapse of trade talks with Bri­tain when they hold a sum­mit later this week af­ter France dug in, ques­tion­ing if it could hold Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s gov­ern­ment to any deal.</p>
    <p>The bloc’s 27 na­tional lead­ers will as­sem­ble in Brussels to­mor­row – the same day Mr John­son has threat­ened to walk away if he con­sid­ers a deal to be un­likely. With an ac­cord hang­ing in the bal­ance, the chiefs will re­view their con­tin­gency plans, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>They will also con­sider the need for strin­gent, legally bind­ing dis­pute-res­o­lu­tion mech­a­nisms in any deal af­ter be­ing stung by Bri­tain’s an­nounce­ment last month that it would uni­lat­er­ally re­write parts of the Brexit di­vorce agree­ment. The move has stoked dis­trust of Mr John­son in EU cap­i­tals, adding a fur­ther ob­sta­cle to any ac­cord and call­ing into ques­tion if a deal can be reached at all.</p>
    <p>“We are well pre­pared for both sce­nar­ios, ev­ery­body should know that,” Ger­man Euro­pean Af­fairs Min­is­ter Michael Roth said yesterday. “No deal is the worst case sce­nario, not just for the Euro­pean Union but also for the UK, but we are pre­pared for that.”</p>
    <p>EU chief ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier spent yesterday up­dat­ing all 27 gov­ern­ments in Lux­em­bourg on the state of the de­lib­er­a­tions. While Bri­tain is push­ing the bloc to soften its de­mands on fish­ing, the EU is de­mand­ing con­ces­sions from it, in­clud­ing lim­its on what state aid it will be al­lowed to pro­vide to busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The dis­cus­sions about con­tin­gency plan­ning are, to an ex­tent, a ne­go­ti­at­ing tac­tic to lower ex­pec­ta­tions and put pres­sure on both sides to reach an ac­cord, a se­nior EU diplo­mat with knowl­edge of the talks said. But he added that gov­ern­ments were now get­ting ner­vous about the pos­si­bil­ity of fail­ure, and want the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion to bring for­ward con­tin­gency mea­sures soon.</p>
    <p>“We do want to trust the UK, but what we have seen in the last weeks re­gard­ing the with­drawal agree­ment is ex­tremely wor­ry­ing,” French Euro­pean Af­fairs Min­is­ter Cle­ment Beaune said on Mon­day. “It’s a mat­ter of how the UK is a part­ner of trust in the years to come,” he added.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain’s chief ne­go­tia­tor David Frost said last week that his team would still need to go on ne­go­ti­at­ing with the EU even if they fail to reach a free-trade agree­ment. He said the two sides would have to come to ar­range­ments in ar­eas in­clud­ing flights and road haulage.</p>
    <p>But the EU is un­likely to agree to a se­ries of such sec­tor-by-sec­tor mini-deals, an of­fi­cial said. If talks col­lapse, the bloc would fo­cus on strik­ing agree­ments with Bri­tain only where it sees an ur­gent need and where fail­ing to do so would dam­age its econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son held talks with French Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron and Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel over the week­end in an at­tempt to break the deadlock. A spokesman for the Prime Min­is­ter said on Mon­day that there was lit­tle time left but that the gov­ern­ment was com­mit­ted to work­ing hard to bridge its dif­fer­ences with the bloc.</p>
    <p>France, though, has yet to sig­nal it is pre­pared to of­fer any con­ces­sions over fish­eries that would un­lock a deal, and has so far re­buffed at­tempts by Mr Barnier and other EU coun­tries to make com­pro­mises, a sec­ond EU of­fi­cial said.</p>
    <p>“Frankly speak­ing, we are at a crit­i­cal stage of the ne­go­ti­a­tions,” said Mr Roth. “We are ex­tremely un­der pres­sure, time is run­ning out, and we ex­pect sub­stan­tial progress by our friends in the UK in key ar­eas.”</p>
