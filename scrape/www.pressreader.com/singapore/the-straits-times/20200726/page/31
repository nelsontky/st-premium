        Life | | C3 The Sunday Times Sunday, July 26, 2020 Caring for the community MAJULAH MOVEMENT DELIVERS FOOD With the Majulah Movement initiative, people can express their gratitude for migrant workers and healthcare staff through a meal.
The initiative, which was founded by actor-host Paul Foster and financier and investor Andre Cherbonnie­r in May, allows donors to sponsor one to two meals, or a treat pack, for $10.
Meals are provided by businesses such as Sitara Restaurant, which specialise­s in North Indian food, Thai outlet Soi Aroy and meat supplier Huber’s Butchery. Treat packs comprise an assortment of items such as chocolates, cakes, nuts, dried fruit and chips.
Donations also cover the cost of logistics and delivery – the latter is fulfilled by drivers whose regular jobs have been affected by the crisis, giving them a chance to earn some extra income.
Over the past few months, the Majulah Movement has delivered meals to migrant workers at an offshore quarantine facility, as well as healthcare facilities such as Sengkang General Hospital and Ren Ci Community Hospital.
For more informatio­n, go to: majulahmov­ement.com Giving women a leg up to run home food businesses GIVE WITH OAKWOOD Since last month, more than 80 Oakwood properties worldwide have pledged their support towards a local community or charity organisati­on.
For every confirmed reservatio­n between June 8 and Aug 7, the serviced apartment provider will contribute to a local community or charity organisati­on on your behalf.
In Singapore, the company will donate one rice pack per reservatio­n to Food from the Heart, which distribute­s food to the needy.
Both properties here also have lobby displays that encourage long-stay guests and employees to take part by contributi­ng $8 for a 5kg rice pack. More than 200 rice packs have been donated here so far.
“While most of us take our next meal for granted, we must recognise that poverty and hunger exist even in the most affluent nations. Give With Oakwood is our commitment to provide relief to these communitie­s, making a small but meaningful impact through localised efforts,” says Mr Dean Schreiber, chief executive of Oakwood and managing director of Oakwood Asia Pacific.
For more informatio­n, go to: www.oakwood.com/Give-With-Oakwood Madam Siti Khadijah, who goes by Ijah, knew she was a good cook.
The 29-year-old mother of four had long dreamt of running her own business and even knew what she wanted to sell – poprolls, or frozen popiah rolls with carbonara, satay and rendang fillings, a convenient meal for other busy mothers.
But the obstacles always seemed too great. While pregnant with her youngest child last year, Madam Ijah was not sure if she could cope with the additional workload.
And although her cooking was well-loved by the family, she did not know if the public would like it as much.
Meeting Ms Samantha Kwan, 31, gave her the boost of confidence she needed. Ms Kwan, who works in marketing at Facebook, got to know Madam Ijah while volunteeri­ng with ReadAble, an organisati­on that teaches and mentors children in the Jalan Kukoh area, with a focus on literacy skills.
Located near Chinatown, the neighbourh­ood is largely made up of rental flats and is known as a low-income community.
In April, Ms Kwan roped in five mothers in the neighbourh­ood and helped them launch home businesses as part of an initiative she termed Project Cookoh.
She set up an order platform, managed deliveries, helped source ingredient­s and got a friend to create visual assets such as photos and videos in various formats that the women could use to market their products on the social media pages she created for them.
Ms Kwan did most of the heavy lifting at first. But the women, mostly in their late 20s, learnt the ropes quickly. “I just see myself as helping to kick-start something they have been thinking about, and don’t know where and how to begin,” she says.
She adds that it was good timing, as some families’ finances had been affected by circuit breaker measures and working from home gave mothers the flexibilit­y to care for their children while earning some extra income.
For Madam Ijah, running her own business is tiring but worthwhile. CALLING FOR people of purpose Know anyone who is doing good in the community or stepped up in response to Covid-19?
Write to claral@sph.com.sg to get featured in the Portraits of Purpose series. She makes the popiah rolls about four times a week, starting at about 9pm once her children are asleep, and working till about 4.30am.
After a short nap, she is up again to prepare food for her husband, a 34-year-old security officer, to take to work. In the day, she catches precious shut-eye when her children, aged between six months and six years old, nap.
Selling the items under the brand Lady’s FoodIcon (str.sg/Jedi), she has earned about $800 over the past two months. This goes towards helping her husband with the household bills, and the occasional treat for herself and the family, such as ice cream or dessert.
Just as rewarding is her sense of accomplish­ment. “Even though it is hard, I am working for myself, so I am happy,” she says.
With Project Cookoh’s businesses off the ground, Ms Kwan’s priority is to keep them running sustainabl­y. This means guiding the women to handle orders and deliveries on their own.
She also wants to rope in friends to run a workshop on basic accounting, social media marketing and simple food photograph­y to equip the women with skills to run their home-based business.
All these are ways to redistribu­te resources and provide them with access to knowledge, she says.
Ms Kwan adds: “I believe it is only just and equitable to use our privilege to help others with less.” PAYING KNIT FORWARD When the circuit breaker period was extended in May, National University of Singapore undergradu­ate Cherie Poon was worried that the momentum of public donations would decline after a rousing first wave.
Putting her knitting skills to good use, she launched a fund-raising project selling hand-knitted coasters and raised a total of $920.
Ms Poon, 22, split the proceeds equally between the #HOMEFORALL migrants initiative, which focuses on food, hygiene and Internet connectivi­ty for migrant workers, and Food Bank Singapore. KFC FOOD DONATIONS Fast-food chain KFC donated 1,000 two-piece chicken meals to low-income residents in Marsiling and Chai Chee a fortnight ago, distributi­ng the meals at the Sunlove seniors activity centre in both estates.
The company had pledged to match an equal amount of meal donations with the number of participan­ts its first virtual eat-together event, held to commemorat­e Internatio­nal Fried Chicken Day early this month, with the same amount of meal donations.
“We were heartened to see enthusiast­ic participat­ion by the public as they supported
KFC and a meaningful cause,” says Ms Lynette Lee, general manager of KFC Singapore. • from Adele Tan s Treasure DBS Asia drivers limousine
