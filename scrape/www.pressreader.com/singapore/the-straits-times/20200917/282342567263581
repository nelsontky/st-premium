    <p>• Bournemout­h man­ager Ja­son Tin­dall hailed his “cool cus­tomers” fol­low­ing the Cham­pi­onship club’s epic 11-10 League Cup shoot-out vic­tory over Crys­tal Palace that earned them a thir­dround tie with hold­ers Manch­ester City.</p>
    <p>After all 20 out­field play­ers scored, As­mir Be­govic saw his penalty saved by fel­low goal­keeper Wayne Hen­nessey but the Cher­ries stop­per still fin­ished as the hero against the Pre­mier League side on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Hen­nessey blazed over the cross­bar before Be­govic saved from Palace cap­tain and first-choice penalty taker Luka Milivojevi­c to earn Bournemout­h a trip to City.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got some cool cus­tomers un­der pres­sure and I felt they showed that tonight with the stan­dard of penal­ties that they took,” Tin­dall told lo­cal pa­per the Daily Echo.</p>
    <p>The qual­ity of the fin­ish­ing was less ap­par­ent over the goal-less 90 min­utes at the Vi­tal­ity Sta­dium, with Bournemout­h reg­is­ter­ing three shots on tar­get from 17 at­tempts at goal.</p>
    <p>At the other end, Be­govic was forced to make just one save dur­ing reg­u­la­tion time and Crys­tal Palace boss Roy Hodg­son ad­mit­ted the bet­ter side won.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery penalty was al­most per­fect, so con­grat­u­la­tions to both teams on that, and con­grat­u­la­tions to Bournemout­h on win­ning the game.</p>
    <p>“They de­served to win it – they played very well and I can only wish them luck at City next week.”</p>
    <p>Tin­dall is rel­ish­ing the chal­lenge of fac­ing Pep Guardi­ola’s men even though Bournemout­h, who were rel­e­gated last sea­son, have lost their last 10 Pre­mier League matches against City.</p>
    <p>“As a man­ager and player, you want to pit your­self against the best teams and the best peo­ple in the in­dus­try you are in,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It will be such a tough game, as it al­ways has been when­ever we have gone to Manch­ester City, but it will be a great chal­lenge for us.”</p>
