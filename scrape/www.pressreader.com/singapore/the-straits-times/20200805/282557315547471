    <p>Vet­eran singer-song­writer Michael Bolton has been pick­ing up new skills amid the lock­down and stay­home or­ders in the United States’ bat­tle with the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In a tele­phone in­ter­view with The</p>
    <p>Straits Times from Con­necti­cut in the US, the 67-year-old says: “I’ve learnt to use a dish­washer, cook pasta and how to put a pil­low into a pil­low case.</p>
    <p>“I’m not all that do­mes­ti­cated and it’s some­thing I didn’t re­alise I need so much.”</p>
    <p>Bolton, who will be a res­i­dent judge on Asian Dream, a new re­al­ity singing com­pe­ti­tion, was briefly in Sin­ga­pore last year to film the show.</p>
    <p>“My time in Sin­ga­pore is al­ways en­joy­able and I’ve been there a few times. It’s one of those places where when pro­mot­ers of­fer me a show, I al­ways try to fit it in,” says the co-cre­ator of Asian Dream.</p>
    <p>The show will pre­miere to­mor­row on AXN (StarHub TV Chan­nel 511 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 304).</p>
    <p>Bolton pre­vi­ously fronted an­other re­al­ity singing com­pe­ti­tion, Bolt Of Tal­ent, in 2017, but his new se­ries has more per­sonal men­tor­ship time with the six con­tes­tants from around Asia.</p>
    <p>They will com­pete for a spot on his Asian Dream tour next year and the win­ner will also be an am­bas­sador for car-maker Subaru, which is pre­sent­ing the show.</p>
    <p>He says: “It’s sat­is­fy­ing for me be­cause when I started out, all I had was a dream. I didn’t have a men­tor or any­one teach­ing me. I started lis­ten­ing to singers and singing with (Amer­i­can singer-song­writer) Ste­vie Won­der and so on. I re­alised the tech­ni­cal parts of singing only later and highly rec­om­mend voice lessons for some of these new singers.”</p>
    <p>Bolton, who de­buted in 1975, is known for his hit bal­lads such as How Am I Sup­posed To Live With­out You and When A Man Loves A Woman.</p>
    <p>He says of fame in the so­cial me­dia age: “It’s dif­fer­ent. I won’t say it’s harder to be a celebrity. I think it de­pends on your per­son­al­ity.</p>
    <p>“The real goal for an artist is to do the art – you wake up and you go to the can­vas. That was your first task, but then, you find your­self 15 years later try­ing to do just that and noth­ing else and the odds are stacked against you.”</p>
    <p>While Bolton is writ­ing new songs amid the pan­demic, he has also set his sights be­yond mu­sic. He is host­ing his own show, Michael Bolton’s Big Sexy Pod­cast.</p>
    <p>He says: “I’m a new fan of pod­casts, do­ing this is some­thing I’m go­ing to learn a lot from. It’s not easy to do re­search and find out what’s in­ter­est­ing to ask peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“But it’s good for me to in­ter­view peo­ple whom I love, whose work I love, be it artists, writ­ers, singers or film-mak­ers.”</p>
    <p>Asian Dream pre­mieres to­mor­row on AXN (StarHub TV Chan­nel 511 and Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 304) at 7.25pm. The episodes are also avail­able on­line there­after at www.subaru.asia/asian­dream.</p>
