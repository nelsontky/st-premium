    <p>It has been a record-break­ing few months, but not in a good way.</p>
    <p>The three months from April to June saw an un­prece­dented high of 81,720 em­ploy­ees, both lo­cal and for­eign, be­ing placed on short work weeks or tem­po­rar­ily laid off, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>This is more than triple the pre­vi­ous peak of 26,530 in the first quar­ter of 2009 dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial crisis.</p>
    <p>These tem­po­rary cost-sav­ing mea­sures have likely cush­ioned the labour mar­ket from the full im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic. The sec­ond-quar­ter re­trench­ments re­mained lower than the 12,760 in the first quar­ter of 2009, though they still rose to a trou­bling 8,130, the high­est fig­ure since that peak.</p>
    <p>Part of the rea­son for the lower re­trench­ment fig­ures could be at­trib­uted to gov­ern­ment aid such as wage sub­si­dies and de­ferred loan re­pay­ments, as well as state­ments from the au­thor­i­ties, unions and busi­ness as­so­ci­a­tions urg­ing com­pa­nies to view re­trench­ments as a last re­sort.</p>
    <p>But there is an un­nerv­ing sense of in­evitabil­ity that more bad news is on the hori­zon.</p>
    <p>In the first place, re­trench­ment fig­ures, though of­ten the eas­i­est to un­der­stand, do not cap­ture the full im­pact of the pan­demic on jobs. The of­fi­cial re­trench­ment num­bers cover only em­ploy­ers with at least 25 staff, so those laid off by mi­cro-small and medium-sized en­ter­prises, such as some re­tail­ers, eater­ies and mom-and-pop shops, would not be in­cluded.</p>
    <p>There could also be oth­ers whose con­tracts are not re­newed. Or those who feel com­pelled by their bosses to re­sign or are fired for poor per­for­mance out of the blue – these are called “dis­guised” re­trench­ments.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng se­nior economist Chua Hak Bin noted that gig econ­omy work­ers also do not show up as be­ing re­trenched, though many would have lost their gigs, with events and classes can­celled.</p>
    <p>Look­ing at the to­tal num­ber of peo­ple em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, there was a record half-yearly contractio­n of 129,100 work­ers, ex­clud­ing for­eign domestic work­ers, in the first half of the year. Employment of lo­cals fell by 62,700, or 2.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>The im­pact of Covid-19-in­duced job losses is likely to be­come more wide­spread as the re­ces­sion drags on.</p>
    <p>Citi econ­o­mists Kit Wei Zheng and Ang Kai Wei said in a note on Mon­day that job losses in the first half of this year were likely dom­i­nated by tem­po­rary jobs in con­sumer-fac­ing sec­tors, where em­ploy­ers are more likely to re­duce head­count than cut wages in or­der to lower costs.</p>
    <p>But they cau­tioned that job losses could change di­rec­tion and move to­wards permanent lo­cal jobs in larger com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“Such jobs could be higher-pay­ing, which im­plies that the re­main­ing jobs may also be sub­ject to wage cuts,” they said.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank se­nior economist Irvin Seah said it is still far from clear when the econ­omy will re­cover. A lot is banking on the ar­rival of a vac­cine by next year when, in re­al­ity, that is not a cer­tainty, he added.</p>
    <p>The idea of ex­tend­ing the Jobs Sup­port Scheme wage sub­si­dies in a tar­geted man­ner could be to lessen the shock to the labour mar­ket and re­lease work­ers slowly, in the hopes that re­cov­ery – at least in some sec­tors – will come in time to ab­sorb them.</p>
    <p>The sub­si­dies have been ex­tended by up to seven months to cover wages paid up to March next year for firms in sec­tors hit hard­est by the Covid-19 crisis, and up to De­cem­ber this year for sec­tors which are man­ag­ing well.</p>
    <p>So be­yond help­ing lo­cal work­ers cur­rently out of work, longer-term plans need to be made for those who will suf­fer when the current sup­port mea­sures end.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has been mak­ing ef­forts on this front. The new Jobs Growth In­cen­tive will sup­port em­ploy­ers hir­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and permanent res­i­dents over the next six months.</p>
    <p>The min­i­mum qual­i­fy­ing salaries for for­eign­ers on Employment Passes (EPs) and S Passes are also go­ing up, and the ad­ver­tis­ing re­quire­ments un­der the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work are be­ing tight­ened to sup­port fair hir­ing.</p>
    <p>In fact, the Gov­ern­ment has gone a step fur­ther to en­cour­age em­ploy­ers to view Sin­ga­pore­ans favourably when hir­ing or re­trench­ing. Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo told Par­lia­ment this month that when eval­u­at­ing EP and S Pass ap­pli­ca­tions, MOM will place ad­di­tional em­pha­sis on whether the firm has supported its lo­cal pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian (PMET) staff. She called the move a “tilt in sup­port of lo­cal PMETs that goes be­yond fair con­sid­er­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>It re­mains to be seen whether these moves will make a big dif­fer­ence to lo­cal employment when hir­ing even­tu­ally picks up again.</p>
    <p>Mr Seah noted that the key now is to help com­pa­nies pre­pare for re­cov­ery so that they will be able to cre­ate jobs quickly and ab­sorb re­dun­dan­cies, in­clud­ing from tem­po­rary jobs such as tem­per­a­ture-tak­ers that will even­tu­ally no longer be needed.</p>
    <p>“The most im­por­tant thing is to get the econ­omy back on its feet. That will sort the jobs prob­lem out,” he said.</p>
