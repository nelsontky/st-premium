    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) and the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) have apol­o­gised for in­form­ing a mi­grant worker that he had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 only three weeks after he was swabbed, cit­ing an “ad­min­is­tra­tive er­ror” while he was tested.</p>
    <p>But there was no im­pact on the “ap­pro­pri­ate­ness of the clear­ance strat­egy” for Toh Guan Dor­mi­tory – where the worker was stay­ing with 11 room­mates – or the treat­ment and care of all the work­ers there, the min­istries said in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istries were re­spond­ing to me­dia queries over Face­book posts made by Ms Tsjin Chan­dra Dolly and Ms Kelly Soh last Wed­nes­day. The Straits Times un­der­stands that Ms Tsjin, Ms Soh and the worker be­long to the same com­pany.</p>
    <p>In their sep­a­rate posts, Ms Tsjin and Ms Soh said the worker was in­formed only last Mon­day that he had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19. The worker had un­der­gone the swab test on June 22, Ms Soh said.</p>
    <p>Both women said they were told by MOH last Mon­day that the min­istry re­quired 24 hours to ar­range for the worker to be moved out of the dor­mi­tory room.</p>
    <p>How­ever, noth­ing was ar­ranged by last Wed­nes­day and the worker con­tin­ued to stay in the same room with his 11 room­mates, they said.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, MOH and MOM said Toh Guan Dor­mi­tory has been un­der iso­la­tion since April 6.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the min­istries be­gan clear­ing the dor­mi­tory, sur­vey tests were con­ducted on a sam­ple of work­ers across the dor­mi­tory on June 22.</p>
    <p>This was to as­sess the ex­tent of the spread, and to de­velop the most ap­pro­pri­ate strat­egy for clear­ing the dor­mi­tory, the min­istries said.</p>
    <p>The worker and his 11 room­mates were tested, along with some other res­i­dents in the dor­mi­tory.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey test for the 12 work­ers, which was pooled as sev­eral swabs were added to­gether and tested as a group, came back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>This meant there was a high like­li­hood that all 12 work­ers would have been in­fected, given that they had stayed in the same room for the past three months and the high rate of in­ci­dence else­where in the dor­mi­tory, said MOH and MOM.</p>
    <p>The min­istries also said that the sur­vey tests were not in­di­vid­u­alised test re­sults to be used to clear the work­ers of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>But an ad­min­is­tra­tive er­ror in the “con­duct of the pool test” for the worker was dis­cov­ered, in that the test con­tained only his swab, said MOH and MOM.</p>
    <p>The worker’s test was there­fore ac­tu­ally an in­di­vid­ual test in­stead of a pool test.</p>
    <p>“We have since reached out to the em­ployer to ex­plain the sit­u­a­tion,” the min­istries added.</p>
    <p>The min­istries said that the ad­min­is­tra­tive er­ror does not change or im­pact the over­all pro­ce­dure for clear­ing the work­ers at the dor­mi­tory which, among other things, in­volves a series of tests.</p>
    <p>The worker and his room­mates had con­tin­ued to be cared for in their room and mon­i­tored by med­i­cal staff through­out the test­ing pe­riod. All 12 of them were well through­out the pe­riod and did not ex­hibit any acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The worker has since re­cov­ered from the coro­n­avirus, while three of his room­mates had re­cent in­fec­tions and had been trans­ferred to a com­mu­nity care fa­cil­ity.</p>
    <p>MOH and MOM said all res­i­dents in Toh Guan Dor­mi­tory had been tested at the end of June, and the first two weeks of this month. With the series of tests com­pleted, the dor­mi­tory is ex­pected to be cleared later this month, the min­istries added.</p>
