    <p>Even with heavy fines and pun­ish­ment for il­licit or­gan traf­fick­ing in Sin­ga­pore, peo­ple may still take risks to save their loved ones who have kid­ney fail­ure from hav­ing to go through a life­time of dial­y­sis (Malaysian re­port­edly in­volved in or­gan traf­fick­ing: UK news­pa­per; Aug 10).</p>
    <p>Dial­y­sis is the only way to treat kid­ney fail­ure and it is a process that is a life­long com­mit­ment by both the pa­tients and their fam­i­lies. It is a long jour­ney and it is both tiring and chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>Dial­y­sis pa­tients can­not uri­nate as their kid­neys are no longer func­tion­ing well, and all wa­ter that they drink ac­cu­mu­lates in their bod­ies.</p>
    <p>As such, they have to limit their daily wa­ter in­take to not more than 1,000ml, which is about four cups of cof­fee, not for­get­ting the amount of pills a dial­y­sis pa­tient needs to con­sume ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>Very of­ten, they have to learn how to swal­low pills. Drink­ing wa­ter freely is a lux­ury for dial­y­sis pa­tients.</p>
    <p>To avoid be­ing in such a dire and painful sit­u­a­tion, it would be wise to watch for any early warn­ing signs and take all pos­si­ble pre­ven­tive mea­sures, such as eat­ing in mod­er­a­tion and opt­ing for a health­ier life­style.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Kid­ney Foun­da­tion en­cour­ages dial­y­sis pa­tients to first opt for kid­ney trans­plant as their treat­ment op­tion be­cause trans­plant pa­tients have bet­ter sur­vival and qual­ity of life, with the least dis­rup­tions to their daily liv­ing.</p>
    <p>If you have a loved one who wishes to do­nate a kid­ney to you, please ac­cept it bravely and the donor’s post-surgery an­nual med­i­cal check-ups will be taken care of through the foun­da­tion’s Kid­ney Live Donor Sup­port Fund.</p>
    <p>It pro­vides fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance to liv­ing kid­ney donors cov­er­ing kid­ney-re­lated med­i­cal wel­fare and in­sur­ance.</p>
    <p>For more in­for­ma­tion on fund­ing cov­er­age and ap­pli­ca­tion, call the NKF hot­line on 1800-KID­NEYS (1800-543-6397), or visit www.nkfs.org</p>
    <p>We thank Mr Ra­jagopalan Kr­ish­namoor­thy for his feed­back (MAS re­quest of banks not fair to re­tail in­vestors, Aug 10).</p>
    <p>Mr Kr­ish­namoor­thy asked if it was nec­es­sary for the Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) to in­ter­vene in the lo­cal banks’ div­i­dend pay­outs, and if such a move re­quired share­hold­ers’ con­sent.</p>
    <p>Div­i­dends are a means through which com­pa­nies share ex­cess prof­its with their share­hold­ers. They are dis­cre­tionary in na­ture, sub­ject to the as­sessed cash needs of the com­pany.</p>
    <p>The div­i­dend re­stric­tion an­nounced by MAS will bol­ster lo­cal banks’ strong cap­i­tal buf­fers, strength­en­ing their abil­ity to ab­sorb shocks and sup­port lend­ing to busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als through this pe­riod of un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor ju­ris­dic­tions such as the United States, United King­dom, Euro­pean Union and Aus­tralia have taken sim­i­lar pre-emp­tive cap­i­tal con­ser­va­tion mea­sures.</p>
    <p>MAS’ mea­sure is ap­pli­ca­ble to lo­cal banks and fi­nance com­pa­nies, and is not in­tended to serve as guid­ance for other cor­po­rates.</p>
    <p>We recog­nise that some share­hold­ers rely on lo­cal banks’ div­i­dends for reg­u­lar in­come, and have sought to bal­ance the pol­icy ob­jec­tive of en­sur­ing the banks’ ro­bust fi­nan­cial po­si­tions with the cash-flow needs of these share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>This is why, in­stead of sus­pend­ing div­i­dends al­to­gether as some other ju­ris­dic­tions have done, MAS care­fully cal­i­brated the div­i­dend cut at 40 per cent of the lo­cal banks’ FY2019 div­i­dend per share.</p>
    <p>Should the div­i­dend re­stric­tion turn out to be overly con­ser­va­tive, the re­tained prof­its will still ac­crue to share­hold­ers and they should not be worse off in the longer run.</p>
    <p>Mr Kr­ish­namoor­thy also asked about changes in loan in­ter­est rates. MAS ex­pects loan in­ter­est rates to be re­vised in a timely and fair man­ner in line with mar­ket de­vel­op­ments, tak­ing into ac­count banks’ cost of fund­ing.</p>
    <p>For mort­gages, bor­row­ers cur­rently on hous­ing loans pegged to mar­ket rates, such as the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate, would al­ready have seen in­ter­est rates for their loans ad­just down­wards over the past few months.</p>
    <p>Bor­row­ers can also re­fi­nance their prop­erty loans to take ad­van­tage of lower in­ter­est rates with­out be­ing sub­ject to to­tal debt ser­vic­ing ra­tio rules.</p>
    <p>This is avail­able for both owner-oc­cu­pied and in­vest­ment prop­erty loans. For loans within the lock-in pe­riod, banks may im­pose charges ac­cord­ing to the terms of the loan.</p>
    <p>We en­cour­age bor­row­ers who are fac­ing fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties to get in touch with their fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions to dis­cuss pos­si­ble fee waivers and to work out sus­tain­able debt re­pay­ment op­tions.</p>
