    <p>Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to keep sea cargo vol­umes at 97 per cent of prepan­demic lev­els this year, a bright spot in a trans­port sec­tor badly hit by Covid-19. While air traf­fic has plunged, pub­lic trans­port rid­er­ship has re­cov­ered to over 70 per cent.</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 has se­verely af­fected many as­pects of trans­port, Sin­ga­pore’s sea cargo vol­ume has been do­ing well, re­main­ing close to pre-pan­demic lev­els.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with the start of the year, the vol­ume of sea cargo here stood at 97 per cent in Novem­ber, ac­cord­ing to figures of Sin­ga­pore’s air, land and sea sec­tors re­leased by the Min­istry of Trans­port (MOT) in a Face­book post yesterday.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the per­for­mance of the mar­itime sec­tor in a separate Face­book post, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said it was a “bright spark dur­ing such dif­fi­cult times”.</p>
    <p>“Our port re­mains open, goods... (are) flow­ing. We even man­aged to de­velop ‘safe cor­ri­dor’ pro­ce­dures for crew change, that was viewed as in­ter­na­tional mar­itime best prac­tice,” added Mr Ong. “Look­ing ahead, we are part­ner­ing the in­dus­try to push more strongly for dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and in­no­va­tion while we grow our mar­itime tal­ent pool.”</p>
    <p>Crew changes have been se­verely af­fected due to the pan­demic, with bor­der and travel re­stric­tions leav­ing many sea­far­ers stranded at sea. But with ef­forts such as the use of telemedici­ne, Sin­ga­pore has fa­cil­i­tated more than 60,000 crew changes since March 27, and cre­ated a pro­ce­dure which has been hailed as a global model.</p>
    <p>The Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore has de­vel­oped a guide­book along with the Sin­ga­pore Ship­ping As­so­ci­a­tion and other in­dus­try part­ners, de­tail­ing a set of pro­ce­dures to cre­ate this “safe cor­ri­dor” for crew changes, while min­imis­ing risk to pub­lic health here.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Mar­itime Or­gan­i­sa­tion has cir­cu­lated the guide­book to all mem­ber states as a ref­er­ence, and its sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ki­tack Lim hailed the crew change “safe cor­ri­dor” as a model to ad­dress the is­sue in other ports.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment has also been pro­vid­ing help to the mar­itime in­dus­try. Ear­lier this month, it an­nounced that it was ex­tend­ing aid for more af­fected sec­tors in the in­dus­try to help them tide over the pan­demic, un­der the Mar­itimeSG To­gether Pack­age.</p>
    <p>The pack­age took ef­fect on May 1 to pro­vide sup­port for ship­ping com­pa­nies, Sin­ga­porean sea­far­ers and peo­ple un­der­go­ing mar­itime train­ing, to the tune of $27 mil­lion. With ad­di­tional sup­port, it is now worth $33 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>But re­viv­ing air travel has been chal­leng­ing, and MOT’s figures showed that pas­sen­ger move­ment at Changi Air­port in April plum­meted to 0.004 per cent of what it was at the start of the year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore closed its bor­ders to trav­ellers on March 23 and went into the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod on April 7. Air pas­sen­ger numbers have been creep­ing up since then, and as of Novem­ber, MOT said the fig­ure stands at 0.019 per cent.</p>
    <p>Ef­fort have been made to re­sus­ci­tate avi­a­tion, such as an at­tempted air travel bub­ble with Hong Kong and the lift­ing of bor­der re­stric­tions ear­lier for trav­ellers from Brunei, China, New Zealand and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong had ear­lier in the year un­der­scored the im­por­tance of re­build­ing air links to the coun­try and said the longer Sin­ga­pore’s bor­ders re­main closed, the greater the risk of it los­ing its air hub sta­tus, which is crit­i­cal to its econ­omy.</p>
    <p>MOT’s figures also showed pub­lic trans­port rid­er­ship now stands at more than 70 per cent of what it was at the start of the year. Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in May, this fig­ure fell to a quar­ter of what it was in Jan­uary, but it has been steadily im­prov­ing since June.</p>
