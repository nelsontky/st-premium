    <p>YERE­VAN/BAKU • Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan ac­cused each other yes­ter­day of at­tack­ing civil­ian ar­eas on a ninth day of fight­ing, the dead­li­est in the South Cau­ca­sus re­gion for more than 25 years.</p>
    <p>Hun­dreds of peo­ple have been killed in the lat­est war over Nagorno-Karabakh, a moun­tain en­clave that be­longs to Azer­bai­jan un­der in­ter­na­tional law but is pop­u­lated and gov­erned by eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans.</p>
    <p>The fight­ing in­ten­si­fied over the week­end, and prospects for a cease­fire ap­peared re­mote af­ter an un­com­pro­mis­ing speech from Azer­bai­jan’s Pres­i­dent Il­ham Aliyev on Sun­day. In a tele­vised ad­dress to the na­tion, Mr Aliyev said Az­eri forces were ad­vanc­ing and re­tak­ing lands that they lost to eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans in the 1990s – though Ar­me­nia dis­putes these gains.</p>
    <p>He de­manded that Ar­me­nia set a timetable for with­draw­ing from Nagorno-Karabakh and sur­round­ing Az­eri ter­ri­to­ries, and said his na­tion would not cease mil­i­tary ac­tion un­til that hap­pened.</p>
    <p>“Azer­bai­jan has one con­di­tion, and that is the lib­er­a­tion of its ter­ri­to­ries,” he said. “Nagorno-Karabakh is the ter­ri­tory of Azer­bai­jan.”</p>
    <p>Speak­ing im­me­di­ately after­wards, Ar­me­nian De­fence Min­istry of­fi­cial Art­srun Hovhan­nisyan said: “I don’t think that there is any risk for Yere­van (the Ar­me­nian cap­i­tal), but any­way we are in war.”</p>
    <p>The fight­ing has raised in­ter­na­tional con­cern about sta­bil­ity in the South Cau­ca­sus, where pipe­lines carry Az­eri oil and gas to world mar­kets, and about the pos­si­bil­ity that other re­gional pow­ers could be dragged in – Azer­bai­jan is sup­ported by Turkey, and Ar­me­nia has a de­fence pact with Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Nagorno-Karabakh said Az­eri forces launched rocket strikes on its ad­min­is­tra­tive cen­tre, Stepanaker­t, while Azer­bai­jan said Ar­me­nia fired mis­siles at sev­eral towns out­side the break­away re­gion.</p>
    <p>“The en­emy is fir­ing rock­ets at Stepanaker­t and Shushi. The De­fence Army re­sponse will not be long in com­ing,” said Mr Vahram Po­gosyan, a spokesman for the Nagorno-Karabakh leader.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nian De­fence Min­istry spokesman Shushan Stepa­nyan said: “Tense fights are in progress.”</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan said Ar­me­nia had been launch­ing mis­sile at­tacks on densely pop­u­lated ar­eas and civil­ian in­fras­truc­ture in the coun­try. The Az­eri De­fence Min­istry said its radar sys­tem recorded that launches were made from the ter­ri­tory of Ar­me­nia.</p>
    <p>“It is fake and com­plete mis­in­for­ma­tion that Ar­me­nia opened fire on Az­eri stronghold­s,” said Mr Hovhan­nisyan, the Ar­me­nian of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>The clashes are the worst since the 1990s, when some 30,000 peo­ple were killed, and are spread­ing be­yond the Nagorno-Karabakh en­clave.</p>
    <p>Cease­fire calls from Rus­sia, France, the United States and the Euro­pean Union have pro­duced no re­sult.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Aliyev said Azer­bai­jan must take mat­ters into its own hands af­ter wait­ing in vain for three decades for diplo­matic progress.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts Alexan­der Stronell and Yo­hann Michel, of the In­ter­na­tional In­sti­tute for Strate­gic Stud­ies (IISS) in London, said: “The fight­ing has es­sen­tially put to bed the prospect of any near-term res­o­lu­tion to the dis­pute over Nagorno-Karabakh.”</p>
    <p>If there were all-out war be­tween the two for­mer Soviet re­publics, Azer­bai­jan would have a clear advantage. It has 81,950 reg­u­lar troops and para­mil­i­tary forces, against Ar­me­nia’s 49,100, ac­cord­ing to the IISS.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan has a “qual­i­ta­tive and quan­ti­ta­tive advantage”, and seems to have gained the mo­men­tum by tak­ing con­trol of the air, the two an­a­lysts said, but added it was too early to be sure of the ex­tent of any ter­ri­to­rial gains. Mr Michel said it was likely Azer­bai­jan had de­stroyed at least 30 to 40 en­emy tanks with drones, while los­ing some of its own.</p>
