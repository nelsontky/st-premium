    <p>The com­ple­tion of the six sta­tions in the se­cond stage of the Thom­son-East Coast Line (TEL) will be de­layed by three months due to the im­pact of Covid-19, said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Hence, the sta­tions – from Springleaf to Calde­cott – will open only in the first quar­ter of next year, hav­ing ini­tially been sched­uled to open later this year.</p>
    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) said in Jan­uary that the se­cond stage of the TEL was about 90 per cent com­plete and was on track to open in the later part of this year.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ong said in a writ­ten re­ply to Work­ers’ Party MP Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) yes­ter­day that the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod be­tween April and June, along with the phased re­open­ing af­ter­wards, had caused de­lays to the com­ple­tion.</p>
    <p>Most con­struc­tion work was sus­pended dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim also asked whether there would be any spillover de­lays to other ma­jor planned MRT projects.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said: “Un­like the TEL2 which is near com­ple­tion and pri­ori­tised for re­sump­tion of work, we will only be able to bet­ter as­sess the length of de­lays on sub­se­quent phases of TEL and other MRT projects when con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties have more fully re­sumed.”</p>
    <p>He added that the Gov­ern­ment re­mains com­mit­ted to sig­nif­i­cantly ex­pand­ing the MRT net­work, from around 230km to­day to 360km by the early 2030s. This in­cludes open­ing the re­main­ing stages of the TEL and com­plet­ing the cir­cle with Cir­cle Line Stage 6. It also in­cludes the build­ing of the North East Line ex­ten­sion, Jurong Re­gion Line and Cross Is­land Line.</p>
    <p>The TEL, which was orig­i­nally set to be com­pleted in 2024, will span 43km and serve about 500,000 com­muters daily in its ini­tial years.</p>
    <p>It is Sin­ga­pore’s sixth MRT line, with a to­tal of 32 new sta­tions, in­clud­ing eight in­ter­change sta­tions.</p>
    <p>Two in­ter­change sta­tions – Calde­cott and Bright Hill – are un­der the se­cond phase of the line.</p>
    <p>The first stage of the line, com­pris­ing Wood­lands North, Wood­lands, and Wood­lands South MRT sta­tions, opened in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>About 100,000 house­holds will ben­e­fit from the first two phases of the line, ac­cord­ing to pre­vi­ous es­ti­mates by the LTA.</p>
