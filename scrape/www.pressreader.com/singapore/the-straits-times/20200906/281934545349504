    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • The Malaysian author­i­ties yes­ter­day re­manded for six days four fac­tory man­agers who are sus­pected of in­volve­ment in a wa­ter pol­lu­tion case that caused the wa­ter sup­ply to be cut for mil­lions of peo­ple in Se­lan­gor and Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>The Se­lan­gor Chief Min­is­ter said that the fac­tory in Rawang dis­trict will be de­mol­ished as there was no plan­ning per­mis­sion for it to be built.</p>
    <p>Me­dia re­ports said the ve­hi­cle main­te­nance fac­tory al­legedly poured used in­dus­trial oil i nto drains that flowed i nto Sun­gai Gong, one of the rivers where wa­ter is treated and later piped to homes, in­dus­tries and of­fices.</p>
    <p>Four wa­ter treat­ment plants in Se­lan­gor were shut down on Thurs­day. Ber­nama news agency said 1.2 mil­lion con­sumer ac­counts were af­fected by the shut­down.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor po­lice chief Noor Azam Ja­maludin said the four sus­pects, aged be­tween 50 and 60, are broth­ers who have been man­ag­ing the fac­tory since their father’s death, Ber­nama re­ported.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man, vowed yes­ter­day that those be­hind the in­ci­dent will be charged in court this week.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic anger has boiled over in re­cent days, es­pe­cially af­ter peo­ple learnt that the same com­pany was fined RM60,000 (S$19,700) in March for the same of­fence.</p>
    <p>Se­lan­gor and the fed­eral ter­ri­tory of Kuala Lumpur share the same wa­ter re­sources, sup­plied by rivers and reser­voirs in Se­lan­gor. Se­lan­gor and Kuala Lumpur are the most densely pop­u­lated ar­eas in Malaysia, with about seven mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Pic­tures on so­cial me­dia show thou­sands of peo­ple in many ar­eas queue­ing to fill up pails and bot­tles from wa­ter tankers. Bot­tled wa­ter flew off the shelves in su­per­mar­kets.</p>
    <p>On so­cial me­dia, some mem­bers of the pub­lic ques­tioned why the govern­ment did not shut down the com­pany af­ter it com­mit­ted a sim­i­lar of­fence in March. Oth­ers wanted the govern­ment to shut down the fac­tory per­ma­nently.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral dozen peo­ple from Parti Is­lam SeMalaysia turned up out­side the fac­tory for a peace­ful de­mon</p>
    <p>stra­tion. Re­act­ing to pub­lic anger, Se­lan­gor Men­teri Be­sar Amirudin Shari said yes­ter­day that his state govern­ment will in­struct the fac­tory to va­cate the land.</p>
    <p>“We have asked the owner to re­ha­bil­i­tate the land. The build­ing has to be de­mol­ished,” he told a news con­fer­ence, as quoted by the Free Malaysia Today web­site.</p>
    <p>He added that the Se­lan­gor govern­ment has asked for wa­ter and elec­tric­ity sup­ply to the fac­tory to be sev­ered to pre­vent it from restart­ing op­er­a­tions. Of­fi­cials from Pen­gu­ru­san Air Se­lan­gor (Se­lan­gor Wa­ter Man­age­ment) had said on Fri­day that the four plants would likely be able to serve con­sumers again only from to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>But there was good news yes­ter­day, as the com­pany an­nounced that it has restarted the flow of wa­ter from its treat­ment plants to some homes be­gin­ning at noon, Malaysi­akini news site re­ported.</p>
    <p>The pro­gres­sive restora­tion of wa­ter to con­sumers will take place un­til to­mor­row to 667 ar­eas, or 51.6 per cent of the to­tal af­fected ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Un­der the first phase, the ma­jor­ity of af­fected ar­eas within the Kuala Se­lan­gor, Gom­bak, Kuala Lumpur and Hulu Se­lan­gor dis­tricts will see their wa­ter sup­ply re­stored by the end of to­mor­row. The ma­jor­ity of ar­eas in Pe­tal­ing and Klang dis­tricts will see their wa­ter sup­ply re­stored only un­der phase two, be­tween to­mor­row and Tues­day.</p>
