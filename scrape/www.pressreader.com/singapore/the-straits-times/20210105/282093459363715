    <p>A Tampines Ex­press­way (TPE) slip road to­wards Loyang Av­enue, that was af­fected by a land­slip trig­gered by heavy rain over the week­end, has par­tially re­opened.</p>
    <p>Re­pair work has been com­pleted and one lane is now in use while the lane nearer the land­slip is be­ing kept closed as a pre­cau­tion, the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) noted in a Face­book post yes­ter­day. The land­slip on Satur­day caused seven rail­ings by a mon­soon drain to give way.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The Straits Times, a LTA spokesman said it will close off the af­fected area and mo­bilise re­sources to rec­tify the sit­u­a­tion when it de­tects in­ci­dents that may im­pact the safety of road users, sim­i­lar to what was done to re­pair the slope.</p>
    <p>It said: “LTA will con­tinue to mon­i­tor closely our road con­di­tions and take any nec­es­sary pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures to en­sure pub­lic safety.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Leong Eng Choon from the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s School of Civil and En­vi­ron­men­tal Engi­neer­ing said the sta­bil­ity of a slope de­pends on the strength of the soil, which weak­ens when it be­comes wet from the rain.</p>
    <p>“Hence, the risk of land­slip in­creases when wet weather per­sists over a few days. Some land­slide risk maps use an­tecedent rain­fall (to­tal rain­fall over a few days) as the trig­ger of land­slips.”</p>
    <p>He added that re­pair­ing one spot of the slope does not en­sure that an­other spot will not fail.</p>
    <p>He said: “Depend­ing on the type of re­pair work, the scar where the slip oc­curred is a weak in­ter­face.</p>
    <p>“If the re­pair work con­sists of com­pact­ing soil into the scar to re­store the slope’s orig­i­nal ge­om­e­try, the newly added soil may still slide along the scar un­der wet weather con­di­tion.”</p>
    <p>A video of the slip was cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Mo­torists head­ing to Loyang, Pasir Ris or Tampines can take al­ter­na­tive ex­its at Pasir Ris Drive 12, Pasir Ris Drive 8, Tampines Av­enue 12 or Up­per Changi Road North, the LTA added. It had said on Sun­day that pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions showed that the sta­bil­ity of the slip road was not af­fected.</p>
    <p>A wet start to the year set off land­slips and flood warn­ings across the is­land, with ar­eas in Have­lock, Fort Can­ning and Loyang cor­doned off as re­pair work be­gan.</p>
    <p>A 22m-high tree on the slope of Fort Can­ning Hill fell af­ter a heavy storm, dam­ag­ing a sec­tion of the es­ca­la­tors con­nect­ing Fort Can­ning MRT sta­tion to the hill’s peak.</p>
    <p>A muddy mess was also seen at the foot of a slope that con­nected Ou­tram Sec­ondary School to the Fu­rama RiverFront ho­tel.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity said in an ear­lier state­ment that an en­gi­neer as­sessed that the slope was sta­ble.</p>
    <p>It has been cov­ered with can­vas sheets be­fore re­pair work is car­ried out. The de­bris at the foot of the slope has also been cleared up.</p>
    <p>There were mi­nor land­slips on Kusu Is­land, Lazarus Is­land and St John’s Is­land on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The wet weather is set to per­sist, with rain­fall for the first half of this month ex­pected to be above av­er­age over most parts of the is­land, the Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore said.</p>
