    <p>From the video­tapes to the work­place hugs, much of Broad­cast News, the 1987 satire on me­dia, looks old-fash­ioned.</p>
    <p>But when I watched the film again re­cently, as an es­cape from pan­demic-pro­voked gloom, the scene where the net­work an­nounces a round of re­dun­dan­cies seemed raw and rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>“If there’s any­thing I can do,” says the net­work direc­tor, re­lieved at how a veteran news­man has ac­cepted the news of his forced early re­tire­ment. “Well, I cer­tainly hope you die soon,” re­sponds the de­part­ing col­league.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar scenes are play­ing out at com­pa­nies around the world.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish re­tailer Marks and Spencer; Mel­rose, which owns ven­er­a­ble man­u­fac­turer GKN; New York-based Macy’s depart­ment store; and Euro­pean air­craft maker Air­bus have all an­nounced po­ten­tial cuts in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing trade group Make UK has warned of a “jobs blood­bath”. News­rooms have been par­tic­u­larly hard hit.</p>
    <p>One added twist is that some of to­day’s lay­off con­ver­sa­tions with un­lucky staff will take place by video link rather than in per­son – eas­ier for ner­vous man­agers, but cru­eller for the peo­ple they are lay­ing off.</p>
    <p>An­other, more pos­i­tive, de­vel­op­ment is that com­pa­nies are be­com­ing more cre­ative as they brace them­selves for re­ces­sion, turn­ing to short-time work­ing rather than lay­offs.</p>
    <p>As gov­ern­ments re­move sub­si­dies, what was a sim­ple de­ci­sion to hold staff in re­serve, rather than fire them, will be­come more com­pli­cated.</p>
    <p>But avoid­ing per­ma­nent cuts makes sense, ac­cord­ing to Mr</p>
    <p>David Cote, former chief ex­ec­u­tive of Honey­well. The sheer cost of sev­er­ance – in time, money and ad­min­is­tra­tive has­sle – mounts up.</p>
    <p>Of­ten you have to hire the staff back to meet de­mand as the econ­omy re­cov­ers.</p>
    <p>“If some­one told you that it would take you six months to build a fac­tory, six months to re­cover your in­vest­ment, you’ll get a re­turn for six months, and then you’ll shut it down, you’d never go for it be­cause it would be ridicu­lous,” he writes in his new book Win­ning Now, Win­ning Later. “Yet some­how lead­ers think it makes sense to do the same with peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Honey­well’s re­liance on fur­lough – com­bined with its com­mit­ment to cus­tomers, sus­tained long-term in­vest­ment and at­ten­tion to sup­plier re­la­tions – helped it bounce back.</p>
    <p>Re­search also backs up the hunch on which Mr Cote acted 12 years ago. A 2011 Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment re­view of 19 coun­tries’ ex­pe­ri­ence of short-time work­ing con­firmed such schemes pre­served per­ma­nent work­ers’ jobs be­yond re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent ar­ti­cle for Har­vard Busi­ness Re­view, Pro­fes­sor San­dra Sucher and Ms Sha­lene Gupta ap­plaud United States com­pa­nies such as Tesla and Mar­riott for us­ing fur­lough to soften the blow of this cri­sis. Such schemes let com­pa­nies</p>
    <p>“main­tain con­nec­tions with their em­ploy­ees, cut costs while still pro­vid­ing em­ployee ben­e­fits, and cre­ate a path to a seam­less re­cov­ery”. Yet, de­fend­ing the de­ci­sion in 2008 was one of the tough­est points of Mr Cote’s ten­ure as Honey­well’s boss.</p>
    <p>Man­age­ment, em­ploy­ees and in­vestors were not “trained” to ac­cept short-time work­ing as a so­lu­tion, he told me. Laws dif­fered from coun­try to coun­try, and even state to state. In re­gions where fur­lough was put to a vote, sup­port var­ied in line with the en­thu­si­asm of man­agers for the mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Else­where, while work­ers backed short-time work­ing pub­licly, as Honey­well pushed through suc­ces­sive rounds of fur­lough, Mr Cote re­ceived pri­vate notes from staff urg­ing him to “lay off 10 per cent of our peo­ple and have done with it”.</p>
    <p>As one Fi­nan­cial Times reader said when we asked re­cently about in­di­vid­u­als’ ex­pe­ri­ence of fur­lough: “Lone­li­ness, anx­i­ety, de­pres­sion and guilt are hourly oc­cur­rences.”</p>
    <p>Mr Cote says: “All re­ces­sions are dif­fer­ent, but they all feel mis­er­able.”</p>
    <p>He re­mains con­vinced, though, that ir­re­versible job cuts would have un­der­mined Honey­well’s abil­ity to re­spond to an eco­nomic up­turn, ul­ti­mately harm­ing staff, in­vestors and cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Mr Jamie Di­mon, chief ex­ec­u­tive of JPMor­gan Chase, has de­clared that “this is not a nor­mal re­ces­sion”.</p>
    <p>Mr Cote sug­gests, rather, that 80 per cent of the ac­tions com­pa­nies take to re­spond to re­ces­sion are com­mon across down­turns, whether trig­gered by oil crises, in­fla­tion, ter­ror at­tacks or mort­gage mis-sell­ing.</p>
    <p>To man­agers, he of­fers this ad­vice: don’t panic; think in­de­pen­dently; keep in­vest­ing for the long term; communicat­e; and “what­ever you do, let peo­ple know you’re sac­ri­fic­ing too”.</p>
    <p>Some things, though, don’t change. “This is a bru­tal lay­off,” re­marks Jack Nicholson’s smug an­chor­man, vis­it­ing the newsroom in Broad­cast News, sup­pos­edly in sol­i­dar­ity with his col­leagues.</p>
    <p>“You can make it a lit­tle less bru­tal by knock­ing a mil­lion dol­lars or so off your salary,” says his boss, be­fore rapidly back­track­ing in the face of the trade­mark Nicholson glare.</p>
