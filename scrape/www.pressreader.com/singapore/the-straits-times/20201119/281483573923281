    <p>The Civil Ser­vice will com­pen­sate about 3,000 for­mer and cur­rent civil ser­vants who were un­der­paid due to er­rors in their hu­man re­sources records. The Public Ser­vice Di­vi­sion said it will pay out about $10 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Er­rors have been found in the records of around 3,000 for­mer and cur­rent civil ser­vants, which af­fected their start­ing salaries and med­i­cal leave wages, among other things.</p>
    <p>Dis­clos­ing this yes­ter­day, the Public Ser­vice Di­vi­sion (PSD) said it dis­cov­ered the er­rors while up­grad­ing the civil ser­vice’s hu­man re­sources and pay­roll IT sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The civil ser­vice will com­pen­sate both cur­rent and past of­fi­cers who were un­der­paid be­cause of these er­rors, with the to­tal sum amount­ing to around $10 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Those af­fected rep­re­sented about 2 per cent of the civil ser­vant pop­u­la­tion over the past two decades, said PSD.</p>
    <p>It said it took more than two years after the er­rors were dis­cov­ered to trace and val­i­date the IT sys­tem er­rors, check 102,000 cur­rent and past records which date back to the 1990s, and re­cal­cu­late ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>Most of the er­rors re­lated to in­ac­cu­ra­cies in the full-time na­tional ser­vice records of civil ser­vants.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther checks also found er­rors in the cal­cu­la­tion of med­i­cal leave wages, as well as in a pro­gram used to com­pute pay­ments that some pen­sion­ers make when they re­tire from the ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The mis­takes arose pri­mar­ily be­cause of hu­man er­ror in data en­try, as well as the cod­ing of the IT sys­tems in­volved, PSD said. These sys­tems also had in­ad­e­quate er­ror de­tec­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties, it noted.</p>
    <p>PSD said the Gov­ern­ment will not be re­cov­er­ing the $3.9 mil­lion in ex­cess money paid out, “given that these re­sulted from er­rors made a long time ago”.</p>
    <p>It is also work­ing with all statu­tory boards to check and ver­ify their em­ployee records. “The statu­tory boards will sim­i­larly make good any er­rors if dis­cov­ered.”</p>
    <p>Mr Loh Khum Yean, per­ma­nent sec­re­tary in the PSD, said the Public Ser­vice is deeply sorry for the er­rors and in­con­ve­nience caused.</p>
    <p>“We will make every ef­fort to reach out to every ad­versely im­pacted in­di­vid­ual to apol­o­gise for the er­ror, ex­plain the sit­u­a­tion, as well as make good the dis­crep­ancy,” he said, adding that steps have been taken to en­sure such in­ac­cu­ra­cies do not re­cur.</p>
    <p>To make up for these er­rors, those af­fected may have their pen­sion amounts re­cal­cu­lated or be given a one-time leave dif­fer­ence. They will be paid for long-ser­vice awards they missed out on, and the next tier of awards will be brought for­ward.</p>
    <p>PSD said it will also com­pen­sate those who had to use no-pay leave due to in­suf­fi­cient sick leave and rec­tify the short­fall in start­ing salaries, where ap­pli­ca­ble.</p>
    <p>Asked why it took two years to dis­close the er­rors, a spokesman for the PSD said it had con­sid­ered whether to start no­ti­fy­ing af­fected of­fi­cers while it was still ver­i­fy­ing the po­ten­tial im­pact, or do so later, after it was more cer­tain.</p>
    <p>“On bal­ance, we felt it was im­por­tant to check through the records com­pre­hen­sively be­fore no­ti­fy­ing the in­di­vid­u­als in a sys­tem­atic ex­er­cise. This is so that we can bet­ter ap­pre­ci­ate the ex­tent of the work­force that is ma­te­ri­ally af­fected,” she said.</p>
    <p>“More­over, the friends or col­leagues of in­di­vid­u­als who were ad­versely af­fected and in­formed may also won­der if they are af­fected, and we will be in a bet­ter po­si­tion to ad­dress their con­cerns. Nev­er­the­less, we will be mak­ing good the short­fall with in­ter­est, to make up for the time lapse.”</p>
    <p>Ex­plain­ing how the er­rors oc­curred, PSD said the na­tional ser­vice pe­riod is taken as part of a civil ser­vant’s length of ser­vice.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the “fit­ness cut” pe­riod – where en­lis­tees who meet phys­i­cal fit­ness re­quire­ments serve one or two months less than their peers – was not in­cluded in the records of some 1,400 civil ser­vants. This af­fected ar­eas such as start­ing salaries, re­tire­ment ben­e­fits, leave el­i­gi­bil­ity, ex­tended sick leave quo­tas and in­di­vid­u­als’ el­i­gi­bil­ity for long-ser­vice awards.</p>
    <p>An­other er­ror in­volved wrongly us­ing gross monthly salary in­stead of av­er­age monthly earn­ings to cal­cu­late med­i­cal leave wages for in­jured em­ploy­ees on ser­vice in­jury leave. This af­fected around 1,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The last er­ror was dis­cov­ered in the pro­gram used to com­pute pay­ments that some pen­sion­ers make when they re­tire from the ser­vice, af­fect­ing some 500 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>PSD will con­tact all cur­rent and for­mer civil ser­vants who were un­der­com­pen­sated ow­ing to the er­rors by March next year.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who have left the ser­vice will re­ceive a reg­is­tered let­ter at their last-known ad­dress, as well as phone calls and home vis­its.</p>
    <p>Those with ques­tions can ap­proach the hu­man re­sources de­part­ments of the gov­ern­ment agen­cies they are work­ing in or were em­ployed with.</p>

    <p>WHY THE TWO-YEAR WAIT?</p>
    <p>On bal­ance, we felt it was im­por­tant to check through the records com­pre­hen­sively be­fore no­ti­fy­ing the in­di­vid­u­als in a sys­tem­atic ex­er­cise. This is so that we can bet­ter ap­pre­ci­ate the ex­tent of the work­force that is ma­te­ri­ally af­fected...</p>
    <p>More­over, the friends or col­leagues of in­di­vid­u­als who were ad­versely af­fected and in­formed may also won­der if they are af­fected, and we will be in a bet­ter po­si­tion to ad­dress their con­cerns.
