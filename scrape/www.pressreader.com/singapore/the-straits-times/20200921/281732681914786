    <p>JAKARTA • In­done­sia has sus­pended ex­ports from an In­done­sian seafood com­pany Putri In­dah into China af­ter its frozen fish prod­ucts tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, the coun­try’s Fish­eries Min­istry said in a state­ment last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said that an in­ves­ti­ga­tion is un­der way and that the sus­pen­sion will ap­ply only to Putri In­dah, “whereas the oth­ers can still do ex­port ac­tiv­i­ties as usual”.</p>
    <p>The virus was de­tected on the out­er­most side of the pack­age, not on the fish, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The seven-day sus­pen­sion be­gan last Fri­day, it said.</p>
    <p>A per­son in charge of mar­ket­ing, an­swer­ing a num­ber listed for Putri In­dah, hung up the phone with­out say­ing any­thing.</p>
    <p>China’s Gen­eral Ad­min­is­tra­tion of Cus­toms said last Fri­day that it will stop ac­cept­ing im­port ap­pli­ca­tions from Putri In­dah for one week af­ter a batch of frozen hair­tail fish from the com­pany tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>China is In­done­sia’s big­gest des­ti­na­tion for fish ex­ports. In­done­sia shipped more than 168,300 tonnes, worth over US$240 mil­lion (S$326 mil­lion), there last year, ac­cord­ing to the In­done­sian sta­tis­tics bu­reau.</p>
    <p>China Cus­toms said on Sept 11 that it would halt im­ports from com­pa­nies for a week if their frozen prod­ucts tested pos­i­tive a first or sec­ond time for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia re­ported 3,989 new coro­n­avirus cases yes­ter­day, tak­ing the to­tal to 244,676, data from its Health Min­istry showed. A to­tal of 105 new deaths were recorded.</p>
    <p>The coun­try’s Covid-19 death toll now stands at 9,553, the high­est in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Last Satur­day, In­done­sia re­ported its largest daily rise in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, with 4,168 new cases and 112 deaths.</p>
    <p>The national to­tal of new cases has been steadily ris­ing.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal Jakarta be­gan a sec­ond par­tial lock­down last Mon­day to try to stem the rise in cases there.</p>
    <p>The tight­ened so­cial re­stric­tions, in place for two weeks, mean busi­nesses, malls and houses of wor­ship can op­er­ate only at lim­ited ca­pac­ity, while din­ing in at restau­rants and cafes is not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Mean­while in In­dia, Asia’s worst-af­fected coun­try, the num­ber of cases surged to 5.4 mil­lion as 92,605 new in­fec­tions were added over 24 hours, data from the fed­eral Health Min­istry showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The coun­try has posted the high­est sin­gle-day caseload in the world since early last month and, in terms of to­tal in­fec­tions, it lags be­hind only the United States, which has 6.7 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 1,113 peo­ple died of Covid-19 in the same 24-hour pe­riod, the min­istry said, tak­ing fa­tal­i­ties to 86,752, which is a rel­a­tively low 1.6 per cent of all cases.</p>
