    <p>Nearly four months af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 on April 6, Mr Abdul Rahman is still un­sure how he caught the coro­n­avirus, or if he had un­know­ingly in­fected oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old as­sis­tant man­ager at Mustafa Air Travel re­called meet­ing three col­leagues at work on April 1, who all tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 shortly af­ter. He also met his un­cle for three hours on April 3, sev­eral hours be­fore the 59-year-old was hos­pi­talised for the virus.</p>
    <p>But Mr Rahman, who spent 41 days in iso­la­tion, does not blame any­one. Those who were in­fected with him have all re­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>“We should not blame each other. No­body wants to be sick with the virus,” said the Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, who checks in on his col­leagues and un­cle reg­u­larly. “When my col­leagues tested pos­i­tive, they called me, cry­ing, and I just en­cour­aged them. But I didn’t know I would also test pos­i­tive a few days later.”</p>
    <p>Jobs like his are risky, as he of­ten has to deal with cus­tomers in a crowded mall. His of­fice is lo­cated in the build­ing next to Mustafa Cen­tre, and the Lit­tle In­dia mall is usu­ally crowded on Sun­days with for­eign work­ers from the dor­mi­to­ries vis­it­ing the mall to shop for gro­ceries and send money home, he said.</p>
    <p>“Early on, I was wor­ried that the mall would be­come a Covid-19 clus­ter,” added Mr Rahman, who is from the In­dian state of Ut­tar Pradesh and has worked here for 15 years.</p>
    <p>Mustafa Cen­tre was iden­ti­fied as a clus­ter on April 2. Prior to that, safety mea­sures had been im­ple­mented at his work­place, in­clud­ing tem­per­a­ture checks three times daily for staff.</p>
    <p>He said he was cau­tious wher­ever he went. When he met his un­cle on April 3, for in­stance, he kept a safe dis­tance of 2m. A day later, the older man de­vel­oped a cough and cold, and tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>On April 5, Mr Rahman started feel­ing sick. He had a mild fever, his throat felt sore and his body ached.</p>
    <p>The next morn­ing, a Min­istry of Health (MOH) of­fi­cer rang him to check on the meet-up with his un­cle and if he had any symp­toms.</p>
    <p>“I told them I wasn’t feel­ing well,” said Mr Rahman, who was sent by am­bu­lance to the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal. There, he had an X-ray and swab tests done, and was told to go home and wait. He was con­firmed to have Covid-19 sev­eral hours later.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t think too much,” re­called Mr Rahman, who was sent by am­bu­lance to the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Diseases in the early hours of April 7. “I wasn’t wor­ried be­cause I knew I would be well taken care of in Sin­ga­pore. I was con­fi­dent that I would re­cover very soon.”</p>
    <p>His three house­mates, who live with him in a shop­house apart­ment in Syed Alwi Road, were quar­an­tined. None of them was in­fected.</p>
    <p>Mr Rahman was well enough to be trans­ferred to Mount El­iz­a­beth Novena Hos­pi­tal a day later on April 8, when his symp­toms dis­ap­peared. How­ever, a week af­ter test­ing pos­i­tive, he lost his sense of smell.</p>
    <p>Ini­tially, the fa­ther of two kept his con­di­tion a se­cret from his 35-yearold wife, who lives in In­dia with their chil­dren aged two and five.</p>
    <p>“I missed them a lot, but I didn’t want my wife to worry. The kids would be af­fected too,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Rahman even­tu­ally told his wife a few weeks later, shortly be­fore he was dis­charged from hos­pi­tal. “When I told her, she was quiet for a few minutes,” he said. “But I told her not to worry be­cause I was con­fi­dent that I would be out soon.”</p>
    <p>On May 17, a nurse in­formed him over the phone in his ward that he would be dis­charged. “I was ex­cited and I teared be­cause I know of many who stayed in hos­pi­tal for more than 50 days,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Rahman is thank­ful to the health­care work­ers for tak­ing care of him. “They would come in every few hours to check on me and talk to me, so I didn’t feel lonely,” he noted.</p>
    <p>Af­ter leav­ing the hos­pi­tal, he took a cab home and shared his ex­pe­ri­ence with his cu­ri­ous house­mates.</p>
    <p>But there was no cel­e­bra­tion then as Sin­ga­pore was in the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod. “Dur­ing that time, I couldn’t go out. But I felt happy that I could fi­nally be home,” said Mr Rahman, who re­gained his sense of smell to­wards the end of his hos­pi­tal stay. He has re­turned to work at his com­pany only briefly since his dis­charge as busi­ness has been abysmal since March.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, he is glad that his bat­tle with the coro­n­avirus is over.</p>
    <p>But he urged the pub­lic to stay vig­i­lant: “We need to take the nec­es­sary pre­cau­tions and we will be safe.”</p>
    <p>GRATE­FUL FOR CARE</p>
    <p>They would come in every few hours to check on me and talk to me, so I didn’t ’’ feel lonely.</p>
    <p>MR ABDUL RAHMAN, on the health­care work­ers who took care of him in hos­pi­tal.</p>
