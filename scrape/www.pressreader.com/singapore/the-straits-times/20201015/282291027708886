    <p>Joachim Low’s 14-year reign as Ger­many head coach is un­der pres­sure af­ter his side’s run of poor re­sults con­tin­ued on Tues­day, as they had to come from two goals down to limp to a 3-3 draw against Switzer­land in the Na­tions League.</p>
    <p>Ger­many have drawn four of their last five games – sur­ren­der­ing the lead on three oc­ca­sions – to leave them sec­ond in their Na­tions League group be­hind Spain.</p>
    <p>They squeezed past Ukraine 2-1 with a full-strength side in Kiev on Satur­day and af­ter a 3-3 friendly home draw against Turkey last Wed­nes­day, Low’s side were once again guilty of poor de­fend­ing.</p>
    <p>“Sure, when you con­cede three goals, the de­fence isn’t good,” ad­mit­ted Toni Kroos, who was at fault for the sec­ond Swiss goal.</p>
    <p>The 60-year-old Low has a Ger­man FA con­tract un­til the 2022 World Cup. How­ever, his pop­u­lar­ity among fans has plum­meted – from the heights of win­ning the 2014 World Cup ti­tle – since Ger­many’s de­ba­cle at the Rus­sia 2018 fi­nals when they failed to get out of their group.</p>
    <p>Di­namo Za­greb striker Mario Gavra­novic scored goals ei­ther side of a deft chip by Remo Freuler as all three Swiss goals came from Ger­man mis­takes.</p>
    <p>Ger­many fought back be­hind closed doors with goals by Timo Werner, his Chelsea team­mate Kai Havertz and Serge Gnabry.</p>
    <p>“We al­ways came back, de­spite a lot of set­backs, so we showed some good morale,” said Havertz, put­ting a pos­i­tive spin on a dis­ap­point­ing evening for the Ger­mans.</p>
    <p>On the eve of the game, Low said he ex­pected “con­cen­tra­tion, pre­ci­sion, courage”, but it was the Swiss who showed those char­ac­ter traits to take a 2-0 lead.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man de­fence was caught nap­ping with just five min­utes gone. Right-back Robin Gosens lost the ball, which led to Gavra­novic head­ing over Ger­man goal­keeper Manuel Neuer into goal.</p>
    <p>A weak clear­ance by Neuer then in­vited Gavra­novic to claim his sec­ond, but the striker fired just wide.</p>
    <p>The Swiss grabbed their sec­ond how­ever when Kroos sur­ren­dered pos­ses­sion. Haris Se­fer­ovic flicked the ball across the box to Freuler, who had the time and space to chip Neuer on 26 min­utes to leave Low fum­ing on the side­lines.</p>
    <p>The third Swiss goal was scored when Gavra­novic slammed home a shot af­ter the Ger­man de­fence had again been pulled apart.</p>
    <p>It meant the Ger­mans have con­ceded six goals in Cologne in the space of seven days.</p>
    <p>But Low re­mained de­fi­ant, say­ing: “We started badly but showed great at­ti­tude in com­ing back.</p>
    <p>“That was pos­i­tive. In de­fence we made our share of mis­takes which we have to stop. But we showed that the team is ready to fight.”</p>
