    <p>It has been an event­ful two days as Sin­ga­pore re­cov­ered from a week­end of National Day cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>First, on Mon­day even­ing, in­vest­ment firm Te­masek sur­prised the mar­ket by an­nounc­ing that it would not pro­ceed with its pre-con­di­tional $4.1 bil­lion par­tial of­fer for Kep­pel Corp.</p>
    <p>Then yes­ter­day, all the res­o­lu­tions needed for a re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of Sem­b­corp Marine and a path­way for Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries to go for­ward as a pure-play ur­ban in­fras­truc­ture and en­ergy play were passed by the share­hold­ers of both firms.</p>
    <p>But first, Kep­pel.</p>
    <p>Te­masek’s an­nounce­ment came af­ter Kep­pel breached a key con­di­tion of the deal af­ter post­ing a $697.6 mil­lion net loss for the sec­ond quar­ter ended June 30. This con­di­tion was that Kep­pel’s profit af­ter tax must not fall by more than 20 per cent, or be­low $557 mil­lion, over the cu­mu­la­tive four quar­ters from the third quar­ter ended</p>
    <p>Sept 30 last year.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel’s cu­mu­la­tive loss af­ter tax for the 12 months to June 30 stood at $165 mil­lion, on the back of mas­sive im­pair­ments of $919 mil­lion in the sec­ond quar­ter. As ex­pected, the main cul­prit was Kep­pel’s Off­shore & Marine unit.</p>
    <p>As ex­pected, the re­ac­tion was swift and bru­tal: Kep­pel’s stock dived by over 12 per cent in early trad­ing yes­ter­day, be­fore re­cov­er­ing to close down 11 per cent at $4.80.</p>
    <p>In short, the mar­ket re­acted as if Kep­pel was now in trou­ble with­out a “res­cue” from Te­masek. Herd in­stinct was on full dis­play.</p>
    <p>But here are a few facts.</p>
    <p>First, the Te­masek plan was not an in­jec­tion of new funds. It was sim­ply a plan to buy about $4 bil­lion of shares at $7.35 a piece from other</p>
    <p>The mar­ket re­acted as if Kep­pel was now in trou­ble with­out a “res­cue” from Te­masek. Herd in­stinct was on full dis­play. But here are a few facts. First, the Te­masek plan was not an in­jec­tion of new funds. It was sim­ply a plan to buy about $4 bil­lion of shares at $7.35 a piece from other mi­nor­ity share­hold­ers.

    <p>mi­nor­ity share­hold­ers. In short, it would not have made any dif­fer­ence to Kep­pel’s bal­ance sheet, which, by the way, is still pretty solid by any mea­sure.</p>
    <p>In fact, ex­clud­ing im­pair­ments, Kep­pel posted a net profit of $222 mil­lion for the quar­ter – up 45 per cent from $153 mil­lion a year ear­lier. And for the first half, even af­ter writ­ing off a $69 mil­lion loss on its O&M business, it still posted a 5 per cent in­crease in net profit to $393 mil­lion. So take away the</p>
    <p>O&M im­pair­ment, and Kep­pel isn’t do­ing too badly.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, Te­masek’s of­fer was un­so­licited. And there was never any as­sur­ance that the deal would go through.</p>
    <p>So the main ben­e­fit to share­hold­ers was that the $7.35 of­fer price pro­vided an up­side as­sur­ance in the near term.</p>
    <p>Third, Kep­pel al­ready had a strong and re­al­is­tic Vi­sion 2030 plan as early as May this year, where it out­lined a strat­egy and a road map to achieve a 15 per cent long-term re­turn on eq­uity tar­get.</p>
    <p>The plan builds on its strengths in</p>
    <p>en­gi­neer­ing, de­vel­op­ing and op­er­at­ing spe­cialised as­sets, as well as cap­i­tal and as­set man­age­ment and fo­cuses on four key ar­eas – en­ergy and en­vi­ron­ment, ur­ban de­vel­op­ment, con­nec­tiv­ity and as­set man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Now for the Sem­b­corp deals. With share­hold­ers of Sem­bMarine and Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries vot­ing over­whelm­ingly in favour of the three in­ter-con­di­tional res­o­lu­tions at ex­tra­or­di­nary gen­eral meet­ings for the pro­posed $2.1 bil­lion re­cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion for the off­shore and marine en­gi­neer­ing group, the two will now de­cou­ple.</p>
    <p>Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries will subscribe for up to $1.5 bil­lion of the rights shares by set­ting off a $1.5 bil­lion sub­or­di­nated loan it ex­tended to its sub­sidiary in June last year. These Sem­bMarine shares will then be dis­trib­uted in specie to Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Te­masek, hav­ing ob­tained a white­wash res­o­lu­tion, will likely end up with a much larger di­rect stake in</p>
    <p>Sem­bMarine.</p>
    <p>But here’s the thing.</p>
    <p>Lead­ing up to Mon­day, the mar­ket had widely spec­u­lated that the ul­ti­mate plan in all of this was to merge a re­vi­talised Sem­bMarine and Kep­pel’s O&M business un­der a Te­masek um­brella, cre­at­ing a new larger and stronger en­tity.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with the Te­masek-Kep­pel deal fall­ing through, all bets are off.</p>
    <p>Or so it seems.</p>
    <p>But re­mem­ber, Te­masek al­ready has a 20.4 per cent stake in Kep­pel. And it could ac­cu­mu­late up to 58 per cent of Sem­bMarine, de­pend­ing on how many of the com­pany’s share­hold­ers do not take up their rights.</p>
    <p>Then there is that small, rather un­no­ticed, phrase in Kep­pel’s re­sponse on Mon­day night: “Notwith­stand­ing the with­drawal of the par­tial of­fer, we in­tend to en­gage Te­masek, which re­mains our sin­gle largest share­holder, to ex­plore op­por­tu­ni­ties for strate­gic col­lab­o­ra­tion.”</p>
    <p>Re­mem­ber the old say­ing: When one door closes, an­other will open.</p>
    <p>When the prover­bial dust fi­nally set­tles, it could be a win-win-win for Sem­bMarine, Sem­b­corp In­dus­tries and Kep­pel.</p>
