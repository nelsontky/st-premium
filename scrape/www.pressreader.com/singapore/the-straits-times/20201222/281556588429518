    <p>A po­lice of­fi­cer in the Philip­pines, Sergeant Jonel Nuezca, 46, (above) faces mur­der charges af­ter a video sur­faced yes­ter­day show­ing him shoot­ing a neigh­bour and her son at point blank in broad day­light. Crit­ics say the killing re­flected the cul­ture of im­punity in the po­lice force, stoked by Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte’s war against drugs.</p>
    <p>Filipinos woke up yes­ter­day morn­ing to a har­row­ing five-minute video of an off-duty po­lice of­fi­cer shoot­ing point blank at a neigh­bour and her son in broad day­light in front of a small crowd.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent was shock­ing and dis­turb­ing for its por­trayal of brazen im­punity, crit­ics said.</p>
    <p>It has also once again cast a harsh light on per­ceived abuses by po­lice­men pur­port­edly em­bold­ened by a pres­i­dent said to be mol­ly­cod­dling of­fi­cers car­ry­ing out his bloody drug war.</p>
    <p>The video showed Mrs Sonya Gre­go­rio, 52, with her arms wrapped tightly around her son, Mr Frank An­thony Gre­go­rio, 25, as they were con­fronted by Sergeant Jonel Nuezca, 46, just out­side her house in Paniqui town, Tarlac prov­ince, 230km north of the cap­i­tal Manila.</p>
    <p>Po­lice re­ports said the scuf­fle be­gan af­ter Mr Gre­go­rio set off an air can­non made out of a PVC pipe at around 5pm on Sun­day, cre­at­ing a loud noise.</p>
    <p>Nuezca stormed out of his house to con­front and ar­rest Mr Gre­go­rio. A heated ar­gu­ment en­sued, not just over the noise but also over a long-run­ning land dis­pute Nuezca had with Mrs Gre­go­rio’s fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The scuf­fle es­ca­lated as rel­a­tives of both Mrs Gre­go­rio and Nuezca joined in. A man was seen try­ing to pacify Nuezca. One woman was plead­ing for Mr Gre­go­rio to apol­o­gise and for Nuezca to leave.</p>
    <p>Sec­onds be­fore the shoot­ing, Nuezca’s daugh­ter ap­proached Mrs Gre­go­rio, slapped the woman’s arm and told her to let go of her son and hand him over to Nuezca, who by then had grabbed one of Mr Gre­go­rio’s arms.</p>
    <p>“Just let go of him! Just let go!” the girl shouted.</p>
    <p>Mrs Gre­go­rio told her: “You tell (your fa­ther) to let go.”</p>
    <p>When the girl shouted that her fa­ther is a po­lice­man, the woman replied, “I don’t care!” and taunted her.</p>
    <p>Nuezca then pulled out his 9mm pis­tol and shot Mrs Gre­go­rio in the head, with dozens watch­ing and at least two peo­ple tak­ing videos with their phones. He then shot Mr Gre­go­rio, also in the head.</p>
    <p>Just be­fore he fled the scene, he again shot Mrs Gre­go­rio in the head as she lay sprawled on the ground.</p>
    <p>Nuezca sur­ren­dered hours later and is now fac­ing mur­der charges.</p>
    <p>Politi­cians, celebritie­s and so­cial me­dia in­flu­encers have de­manded accountabi­lity and jus­tice for the vic­tims.</p>
    <p>Sen­a­tor Pan­filo Lac­son, a for­mer po­lice chief, said the Philip­pine Na­tional Po­lice (PNP) should show no mercy. “They should spare no ef­fort to make sure that he rots in jail. He’s the last po­lice­man that they need in the force,” he said.</p>
    <p>In­te­rior Sec­re­tary Ed­uardo Ano, whose min­istry su­per­vises the 200,000-strong po­lice force, said: “We do not and will never tol­er­ate such acts and we will make sure that he will ac­count for his crimes”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ano also de­scribed it as an “un­for­tu­nate but iso­lated in­ci­dent”.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment crit­ics dis­agreed, say­ing the killing re­flected the “ex­e­cu­tioner’s men­tal­ity” among po­lice­men be­cause of a “cul­ture of im­punity” stoked by Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte him­self.</p>
    <p>“So long as the cul­ture of im­punity ex­ists in the coun­try, and when there is a sys­tem that re­wards mis­deeds in­stead of pun­ish­ing them, po­lice abuses and vi­o­lence will con­tinue. Im­punity breeds trig­ger-happy cops,” said op­po­si­tion politi­cian Franklin Drilon.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Crim­i­nal Court last week is­sued a pre­lim­i­nary re­port in which it said there was ev­i­dence to show crimes against hu­man­ity had been com­mit­ted in the Philip­pines un­der Mr Duterte, whose bloody drug war has left thou­sands dead since 2016.</p>
    <p>At l east 8,000 drug sus­pects have been killed since Mr Duterte took of­fice more than four years ago. Rights groups have re­ported higher num­bers, and said the vi­o­lence has con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>But Mr Duterte has stood firmly be­hind the po­lice, at­tribut­ing most of the killings to turf wars among drug gangs, and ex­on­er­at­ing po­lice­men in­volved by say­ing t hey merely shot back when fired upon.</p>
    <p>He has said he will par­don any of­fi­cer found guilty of mur­der while car­ry­ing out his crack­down.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics say such high-level rhetoric is be­ing in­ter­preted within the po­lice force as “per­mis­sion to kill”.</p>
