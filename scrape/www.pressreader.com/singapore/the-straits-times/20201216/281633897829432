    <p>Chil­dren will not need to have their TraceTo­gether to­kens when they re­turn to school next year, Min­is­ter of State for Ed­u­ca­tion Sun Xuel­ing said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She re­as­sured par­ents that the to­kens will be re­quired in schools only when all of them have been dis­trib­uted na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>“If the TraceTo­gether to­ken dis­tri­bu­tion has not yet reached your town, do not worry. It is not manda­tory yet for your child to have a TraceTo­gether to­ken when school re­opens,” she posted on Face­book yes­ter­day morn­ing.</p>
    <p>Pri­mary and sec­ondary schools re­open on Jan 4, while ju­nior col­leges and the Mil­len­nia In­sti­tute re­open on Jan 11.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun’s state­ment is in line with the cur­rent Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) guide­lines listed on its web­site.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the guide­lines, all in­di­vid­u­als aged seven and above are re­quired to use ei­ther the TraceTo­gether to­ken or the mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion in schools.</p>
    <p>How­ever, SafeEn­try us­ing ex­clu­sively the TraceTo­gether sys­tem will be en­forced only when every­one has had a chance to col­lect a to­ken at a com­mu­nity club or cen­tre in their re­spec­tive con­stituency, or to down­load the ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The MOE web­site also states that stu­dents will not be de­nied en­try into schools if they mis­place or for­get their to­ken, or do not have the ap­pli­ca­tion on their phones.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents were pre­vi­ously able to col­lect the to­kens from any of 38 com­mu­nity cen­tres, be­fore the for­ma­tion of long queues prompted the Govern­ment to stag­ger the roll-out.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, res­i­dents can col­lect the to­kens only at their own com­mu­nity cen­tres, with to­kens be­ing made avail­able one cen­tre at a time.</p>
    <p>All res­i­dents aged seven and above, in­clud­ing pass hold­ers, are en­ti­tled to one to­ken each.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun’s post came af­ter Prime</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong an­nounced on Mon­day that Sin­ga­pore would en­ter phase three of its safe re­open­ing on Dec 28.</p>
    <p>“In my en­gage­ment with 30 vol­un­teers last night, most ex­pressed hope and en­thu­si­asm for the new mea­sures,” said Ms Sun, who is also Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>“Stay safe, stay vig­i­lant. We can do this to­gether,” she added.</p>
