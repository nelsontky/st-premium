    <p>I’ve been asked re­peat­edly in re­cent days to ex­plain Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg’s ac­com­plish­ment: How did she, a young, un­known lawyer, start­ing ba­si­cally from scratch, per­suade the nine men of the US Supreme Court to join her in con­struct­ing a new ju­rispru­dence of sex equal­ity?</p>
    <p>I replied that she had a project, a goal from which she never de­vi­ated dur­ing her long ca­reer. It was to have not only the Con­sti­tu­tion but also so­ci­ety it­self un­der­stand men and women as equal.</p>
    <p>Fair enough, as far as that ex­pla­na­tion goes. But I think it misses some­thing deeper about Jus­tice Gins­burg, who died on Sept 18 at the age of 87. What she had, in ad­di­tion to pas­sion, skill and a field mar­shal’s sense of strat­egy, was imag­i­na­tion.</p>
    <p>She en­vi­sioned a world dif­fer­ent from the one she had grown up in, a bet­ter world in which gen­der was no ob­sta­cle to women’s achieve­ment, to their abil­ity to dream big and to re­alise their as­pi­ra­tions. Then she set out to use the law to usher that world into ex­is­tence.</p>
    <p>What fired her imag­i­na­tion? Yes, there was her eye-open­ing time spent in star­tlingly egal­i­tar­ian 1950s Swe­den. Yes, there was her in­abil­ity to get a top-ranked job, or clerk­ship, or teach­ing po­si­tion de­spite grad­u­at­ing from law school at the top of her class. Yes, her mother, Mrs Celia Bader, trans­ferred her own thwarted am­bi­tions to her bril­liant daugh­ter. All this is true, yet some­how re­duc­tive.</p>
    <p>The best an­swer may be sim­ply that Ruth Gins­burg saw things that oth­ers didn’t. She un­der­stood that the law could be har­nessed in ser­vice to fun­da­men­tal trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>That’s the dif­fer­ence be­tween imag­i­na­tion and goals. We all have goals, big or small, and we all en­counter ob­sta­cles to ac­com­plish­ing some of them. But only a few have the turn of mind to con­front head-on the struc­tural ob­sta­cles that stand in their way.</p>
    <p>Some do it with the gift of an out­size per­son­al­ity who can in­spire oth­ers and gal­vanise them to ac­tion. Think of Rep­re­sen­ta­tive John Lewis, his brav­ery in the face of phys­i­cal vi­o­lence and his abil­ity to move a crowd to tears and bring peo­ple to their feet.</p>
    <p>That wasn’t Ruth Gins­burg. As a lawyer ap­pear­ing be­fore the Supreme Court, she pre­sented her­self as a mod­est in­cre­men­tal­ist. She had to. If she had come be­fore the court as a so­cial revo­lu­tion­ary, the jus­tices – never hav­ing viewed the Con­sti­tu­tion as hav­ing any­thing to say about women – would have re­coiled.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they swal­lowed the bite-size por­tions she served to them, and as­sump­tions about the re­spec­tive roles of men and women – pri­mary wage earner, pri­mary care­taker – that had been baked into the law for aeons dis­ap­peared, one case at a time.</p>
    <p>The abil­ity to imag­ine a dif­fer­ent world is what dis­tin­guishes the lead­ers of any so­cial move­ment.</p>
    <p>Think of mar­riage equal­ity. The idea that mar­riage could be a le­gal op­tion for LGBTQ (les­bian, gay, bi­sex­ual, trans­gen­der and queer) peo­ple ap­peared far-fetched not all that long ago.</p>
    <p>In 1972, in the case of Baker ver­sus Nel­son, the Supreme</p>
    <p>Court dis­missed with­out opin­ion a chal­lenge by two Min­nesota men to the state’s re­fusal to per­mit them to marry.</p>
    <p>The jus­tices deemed the case so frivolous as to not even present the “sub­stan­tial fed­eral ques­tion” nec­es­sary for the court to ex­er­cise ju­ris­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>Many of us who in 2015 cheered the Supreme Court’s Oberge­fell de­ci­sion, which recog­nised same-sex mar­riage as a con­sti­tu­tional right, would ad­mit, if we’re honest, that we had not taken the idea se­ri­ously ei­ther when we first heard it dis­cussed years ear­lier.</p>
    <p>But a lawyer named Evan Wolf­son imag­ined a world where sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion did not de­ter­mine a per­son’s ac­cess to the le­gal, fi­nan­cial and emo­tional ben­e­fits of mar­riage. In 2001 – be­fore the Supreme Court’s de­ci­sion in Lawrence ver­sus Texas over­turned a 17-year-old prece­dent and de­crim­i­nalised ho­mo­sex­u­al­ity as a mat­ter of con­sti­tu­tional law – Mr Wolf­son founded an or­gan­i­sa­tion called Free­dom to Marry to bring that world into be­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Wolf­son wasn’t alone in his quest, of course; I could list many other con­trib­u­tors. My point is that dur­ing no­tably dark years for gay rights (the “don’t ask, don’t tell” pol­icy that kept LGBTQ peo­ple from serv­ing openly in the mil­i­tary lasted un­til 2010), it took imag­i­na­tion to sup­pose that the sun would rise one day on a dif­fer­ent land­scape.</p>
    <p>And to cite an­other sig­nif­i­cant civil rights break­through, it took imag­i­na­tion for the au­thors of the Amer­i­cans With Dis­abil­i­ties Act to en­vi­sion a world in which peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties re­ceive ac­cess not as a mat­ter of grace but as a le­gal right.</p>
    <p>It was only late in her ca­reer, when the court turned sharply to the right and she be­gan to raise her voice in dis­sent, that Jus­tice Gins­burg be­came the iconic RBG, fondly dubbed “no­to­ri­ous” and beloved on the left and by women and girls who weren’t par­tic­u­larly po­lit­i­cally ac­tive.</p>
    <p>I’ll con­fess that the RBG ma­nia – the Hal­loween cos­tumes for lit­tle girls, the col­lars, the mugs dec­o­rated with her face – al­ways made me a lit­tle un­com­fort­able. Peo­ple some­times gave me such para­pher­na­lia; I thanked them and dis­creetly tucked the items away.</p>
    <p>It’s not that I didn’t ap­pre­ci­ate her pow­er­ful dis­sent­ing opin­ions or wasn’t cheered by the thought that lit­tle girls could have such a role model when I my­self had never met a woman who was a lawyer un­til af­ter I had grad­u­ated from col­lege.</p>
    <p>It was that the stuff, the whole shtick, seemed so kitschy when her ac­tual ac­com­plish­ments were so sub­tle and sub­stan­tive.</p>
    <p>But on the night of her death, as I watched the tele­vised im­ages of thou­sands of peo­ple gath­er­ing spon­ta­neously in front of the court, I saw the No­to­ri­ous RBG phe­nom­e­non in a dif­fer­ent light.</p>
    <p>Her un­likely sta­tus as a pop­u­lar icon said as much, if not more, about us as it did about her. We needed her. We needed this frag­ile oc­to­ge­nar­ian who could get up re­peat­edly from her sickbed and speak truth to power. (“You can’t speak TRUTH with­out RUTH”, as a pop­u­lar say­ing went.)</p>
    <p>We needed her to call out Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump as a “faker”, even though judges aren’t sup­posed to say such things and she had to eat her words. We pro­jected onto her our fears about the course of events at the court and in the law, and our hopes that her clear-eyed, al­ways civil dis­sec­tion of where her col­leagues had gone wrong would some­how bring them around. We needed her.</p>
    <p>We still do. the United States Supreme Court and the law. She re­ported on the Supreme Court for The New York Times from 1978 to 2008, and is the au­thor of sev­eral books.</p>
