    <p>We thank Mr Kee Mong Huat for his feed­back on Skill­sFu­ture (Have sys­tem­atic way to up­grade skills of work­force, Aug 28).</p>
    <p>We fully agree with Mr Kee on the need for a more proac­tive ap­proach in sus­tain­ing work­force train­ing and ex­cel­lence. Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore (SSG) has been work­ing closely with the In­sti­tutes of Higher Learn­ing (IHLs) and pri­vate train­ing providers to de­velop high-qual­ity train­ing pro­grammes, cov­er­ing all sec­tors of the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>These pro­grammes cater to those al­ready in the work­force, as well as to fresh grad­u­ates from the IHLs. For ex­am­ple, a fresh in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy polytech­nic grad­u­ate look­ing to spe­cialise in dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing can en­rol in a Work-Study Post-Di­ploma lead­ing to a Spe­cial­ist Di­ploma in Dig­i­tal Con­tent Mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>He could also sign up for a Work-Study Cer­tifi­cate in Dig­i­tal Mar­ket­ing and Brand­ing or take short cour­ses un­der the Skill­sFu­ture se­ries to pick up emerg­ing skills in tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cant course fee sub­si­dies are pro­vided to pur­sue train­ing in these pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, most IHLs of­fer their fresh grad­u­ates cred­its to take up Con­tin­u­ing Ed­u­ca­tion and Train­ing (CET) pro­grammes. These pro­grammes are of­ten bite-sized to al­low in­di­vid­u­als to up­skill while they con­tinue to work.</p>
    <p>They may also be “stack­able”, mean­ing, in­di­vid­u­als can earn cred­its from re­lated CET mod­ules, and these cred­its can be added up to cer­ti­fi­ca­tions that are rel­e­vant to the in­dus­tries the in­di­vid­u­als are in.</p>
    <p>Even as we con­tinue to build up our train­ing ecosys­tem, we must al­low space for in­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies to ex­er­cise per­sonal agency and choice.</p>
    <p>We want in­di­vid­u­als and em­ploy­ers to have the flex­i­bil­ity to pur­sue train­ing that best meets their needs and in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>We en­cour­age this through sup­port mea­sures such as the Skill­sFu­ture Credit and Skill­sFu­ture En­ter­prise Credit.</p>
    <p>SSG also runs Skill­sFu­ture Advice work­shops and Skills and Train­ing Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices to help in­di­vid­u­als make in­formed skills and ca­reer de­vel­op­ment de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers too, should recog­nise skills that are ac­quired through train­ing and en­cour­age their work­ers to con­tin­u­ally up­skill.</p>
    <p>All of us must do our part to in­stil this new cul­ture of life­long learn­ing in our so­ci­ety. We have made progress since the Skill­sFu­ture move­ment started six years ago.</p>
    <p>But much more needs to be done. We will work with all our part­ners and stake­hold­ers in this col­lec­tive en­deav­our.</p>
