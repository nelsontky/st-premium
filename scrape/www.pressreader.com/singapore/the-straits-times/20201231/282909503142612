    <p>Hong Kong ac­tress-singer Ce­cilia Che­ung has been slammed for not re­hears­ing and singing out of tune dur­ing an event in Guangzhou, China.</p>
    <p>On top of that, the 40-year-old star was re­port­edly paid one mil­lion yuan ($203,000) for per­form­ing just two songs at the Satur­day show.</p>
    <p>While she was greeted with warm ap­plause when she ap­peared on stage, things started go­ing down­hill when she be­gan to sing.</p>
    <p>Even though the song was one of her clas­sic hits, Wish Upon A Star, she had prob­lems hit­ting the notes and her voice sounded hoarse.</p>
    <p>She ap­peared out of breath and even coughed a few times dur­ing the short per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>She did ask the au­di­ence for their un­der­stand­ing and apol­o­gised as she was un­well that day and also did not have a chance to re­hearse as her flight was de­layed.</p>
    <p>Com­ments on­line, how­ever, were scathing, call­ing her out for for­get­ting the lyrics, hav­ing an at­ti­tude prob­lem and dis­re­spect­ing the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>The busy star, who re­cently snagged lu­cra­tive ad­ver­tis­ing deals in China, re­port­edly made $52 mil­lion from them alone, so per­haps this singing gig is small pota­toes for her.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she will need to get her voice ready as she is said to have signed up for the sec­ond sea­son of Sis­ters Who Make Waves.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese re­al­ity tal­ent show fea­tures 30 fe­male celebritie­s over 30 years old who com­pete to de­but in a seven-mem­ber girl group.</p>
