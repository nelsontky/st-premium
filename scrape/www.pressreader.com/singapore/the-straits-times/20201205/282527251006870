    <p>Sa­bana Real Es­tate In­vest­ment Trust (Reit), which was un­der pres­sure from ac­tivist funds over a planned merger with larger ri­val ESR-Reit, said its unit hold­ers had voted against a pro­posal to amend its trust deed, thus, ter­mi­nat­ing the merger.</p>
    <p>The ac­tivists had said the deal be­tween Sa­bana Reit and ESR-Reit, whose man­agers are both owned by a unit of Asian lo­gis­tics gi­ant ESR Cay­man, had un­der­val­ued Sa­bana Reit.</p>
    <p>Sa­bana Reit said in a state­ment yes­ter­day that 66.7 per cent of its unit hold­ers had backed the pro­posal to amend its trust deed, but this was be­low the 75 per cent re­quired for the merger vote to go ahead. ESR-Reit man­agers and others hold­ing 24.6 per cent of Sa­bana Reit were not al­lowed to vote.</p>
    <p>“While we be­lieve the merger has a com­pelling strate­gic ra­tio­nale, unit hold­ers have ex­pressed that they pre­fer Sa­bana Reit to re­main as a stand­alone Reit,” said chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Don­ald Han.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the morn­ing yes­ter­day, ESR-Reit unit hold­ers had voted over­whelm­ingly in favour of the merger.</p>
    <p>The ac­tivists’ vic­tory marks a rare win in Sin­ga­pore and sig­nal their grow­ing clout with re­tail share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>Sa­bana, one of Sin­ga­pore’s small­est Reits, has said vot­ing down the deal with a ri­val four times its size would harm its growth prospects amid a lack of al­ter­na­tive bid­ders.</p>
    <p>“When we agreed to the merger process, it was due to a big­ger ship sail­ing past and we wanted to hop onto it so we could con­tinue the jour­ney what­ever the weather,”</p>
    <p>Mr Han, who be­came Sa­bana Reit’s CEO in 2018, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is home to Reits col­lec­tively worth over US$70 bil­lion (S$93.2 bil­lion), mak­ing it Asia’s largest Reit mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Ac­tivist Quarz Cap­i­tal had pro­posed Sa­bana Reit and ESR-Reit merge last year in a cash-plus­stock deal that would value Sa­bana Reit at 54.5 cents a unit, while Black Crane Cap­i­tal had voiced con­cerns about Sa­bana Reit’s mar­ket val­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>When both Reits an­nounced an all-stock deal in July – just as the pan­demic pum­melled the sec­tor – valu­ing Sa­bana Reit at $397 mil­lion or 37.7 cents a unit, both ac­tivists re­jected it.</p>
    <p>They said last month that Sa­bana Reit had failed to close the net as­set value dis­count and had rec­om­mended “a value de­struc­tive merger with a Reit con­trolled by its owner”.</p>
    <p>The funds set up a web­site called “Save Sa­bana Reit” stacked with pre­sen­ta­tions against the merger, sent let­ters to man­age­ment and held we­bi­nars to win over re­tail in­vestors.</p>
    <p>They also sought reg­u­la­tory in­ter­ven­tion to dis­al­low ESR Cay­man from man­ag­ing both Reits if the merger fails, although the cen­tral bank has said there are no rules re­strict­ing such ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>“The ac­tivists have pinned them­selves into a cor­ner. Is Sa­bana worth more? Yes, but is there any­one else who can un­lock its value in this weak mar­ket? No,” said Mr Justin Tang, re­search head at United First Part­ners.</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond merger at­tempt by both Reits af­ter talks were ter­mi­nated in 2017.</p>
