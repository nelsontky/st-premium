    <p>The ju­di­cial man­agers of wa­ter treat­ment firm Hyflux and its unit Hy­drochem are in talks with 14 new po­ten­tial in­vestors, and aim to iden­tify a suit­able in­vestor by the end of next month.</p>
    <p>But these man­agers – from Bor­relli Walsh – said yes­ter­day that they are un­able to dis­close the iden­ti­ties of the in­vestors, many of whom had con­tacted them only re­cently.</p>
    <p>They also said they have con­tacted five in­vestors who pre­vi­ously ex­pressed in­ter­est in Hyflux and Hy­drochem, and con­tinue to work with some of them.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Land has taken a strate­gic mi­nor­ity stake in Cove Liv­ing as the lead in­vestor in the co-liv­ing start-up’s US$4.6 mil­lion (S$6.1 mil­lion) Series A fund­ing round.</p>
    <p>Head­quar­tered in Sin­ga­pore, Cove has about 300 bed­rooms and stu­dios in Sin­ga­pore and about 250 in its new mar­ket of Jakarta. It ex­pects to dou­ble its of­fer­ing to around 1,000 rooms by the first half of next year.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel Land did not dis­close the size of its stake in the com­pany, which was founded in 2018.</p>
