    <p>MARK­ING THE 100th DAY: The coronaviru­s pan­demic may have af­fected Him Law and Tavia Ye­ung’s plan for a grand cel­e­bra­tion for their baby girl’s 100th day.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Hong Kong celebrity cou­ple still made it a mem­o­rable day last Satur­day with beau­ti­ful dec­o­ra­tions at home and a two-layer cake with the fig­ure of a lit­tle girl on top.</p>
    <p>Ye­ung, 40, gave birth on April 16, with the baby given the nick­name of Lit­tle Pearl by her mother-in-law.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress shared sev­eral pho­tos on so­cial me­dia, in­clud­ing of their fam­ily of three in white and Lit­tle Pearl fac­ing the cam­era di­rectly for the first time (left).</p>
    <p>She wrote in Chi­nese: “Dear Lit­tle Pearl, you are three months old and have grown up with­out us re­al­is­ing it. Time may have flown by fast, but daddy and mummy are still work­ing hard ev­ery day to step up our un­der­stand­ing of you. May you grow stur­dily under our care.”</p>
    <p>She added in English, “Mem­o­rable days, with a hun­dred days of bless­ing, healthy growth”, and dis­closed in the hash­tag her child’s name is Hera Law.</p>
    <p>Him Law shared a dif­fer­ent photo of their fam­ily, with Hera look­ing at the cake, as he wrote: “Lit­tle</p>
    <p>Pearl BB, many peo­ple say a man’s daugh­ter is his lover from a pre­vi­ous life and, if this is true, then daddy has waited for you for 36 years.</p>
    <p>”Daddy and mummy only hope you grow up happy and ex­plore a life of your own. We will al­ways love you.”</p>
    <p>Law, who is known for play­ing the blue monk Sha Wu­jing in The Monkey King movie tril­ogy (2014 to 2018), said in me­dia in­ter­views he still felt like a “novice” af­ter three months as a fa­ther. He tried to help his wife by pro­vid­ing words of en­cour­age­ment and pre­par­ing the wet wipes when she feeds the baby.</p>
    <p>Ye­ung, who is known for act­ing in TVB dra­mas such as Be­yond The Realm Of Con­science (2009) and Sil­ver Spoon, Ster­ling Shack­les (2012), said tak­ing care of a baby is more dif­fi­cult than en­dur­ing night shoots.</p>
    <p>She would not mind re­turn­ing to act­ing if there are good scripts and cast, but would fo­cus on her fam­ily in the near fu­ture.</p>
