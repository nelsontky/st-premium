    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES Naomi Osaka, who cap­tured her third Grand Slam ti­tle at the US Open last week­end, pulled out of the up­com­ing French Open with a ham­string in­jury on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately I won’t be able to play the French Open this year,” the Ja­panese said in posts on In­sta­gram and Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>“My ham­string is still sore, so I won’t have enough time to pre­pare for the clay – these two tour­na­ments came too close to each other for me this year.”</p>
    <p>The French Open is due to start next week at Roland Gar­ros. It was resched­uled from ear­lier in the year be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Last Sun­day, Osaka ral­lied from a set down to beat Vic­to­ria Azarenka 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the US Open women’s sin­gles fi­nal, adding a third Grand Slam tro­phy af­ter her vic­to­ries at the 2018 US Open and 2019 Aus­tralian Open.</p>
    <p>The 22-year-old was the first woman to win the US Open sin­gles fi­nal from a set down since 1994, and the vic­tory moved her to third in the WTA rank­ings.</p>
    <p>She also be­came the first Asian player to win three Grand Slams, over­tak­ing China’s Li Na on two.</p>
    <p>Osaka had gone into the US Open at Flush­ing Mead­ows with fit­ness con­cerns.</p>
    <p>She pulled out of the Western & South­ern Open fi­nal with a left ham­string in­jury just two days be­fore the start of the Grand Slam in New York.</p>
    <p>She said she pulled the mus­cle in her semi-fi­nal vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Osaka played her US Open matches with her left thigh heav­ily strapped, but showed no sign that the in­jury hin­dered her.</p>
    <p>The US Open, nor­mally the fi­nal Grand Slam of the sea­son, was just the sec­ond Ma­jor to be played this year af­ter the Aus­tralian Open in</p>
    <p>Jan­uary. The Covid-19 pan­demic saw Wim­ble­don can­celled and Roland Gar­ros moved from its usual May start to Sept 27-Oct 11.</p>
    <p>Un­like the US Open, or­gan­is­ers at Roland Gar­ros will ad­mit fans, although it was an­nounced on Thurs­day that the num­ber of spec­ta­tors will be lim­ited to 5,000 a day.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers had orig­i­nally hoped to ac­com­mo­date 20,000 spec­ta­tors a day.</p>
    <p>De­fend­ing women’s cham­pion Ash­leigh Barty of Aus­tralia an­nounced ear­lier this month that she would not de­fend her ti­tle be­cause she feared par­tic­i­pa­tion still car­ried health risks and be­cause she had not been able to train prop­erly with her coach be­cause of the state bor­der clo­sures in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Osaka’s ab­sence would im­prove Ser­ena Wil­liams’ chances of win­ning a record-ty­ing 24th Grand Slam sin­gles ti­tle if the Amer­i­can chooses to play. The 38-year-old has pulled out of the on­go­ing Ital­ian Open with an Achilles is­sue.</p>
    <p>In the round of 16 in Rome yes­ter­day, Karolina Pliskova beat Anna Blinkova 6-4, 6-3, Si­mona Halep de­feated Dayana Yas­trem­ska 7-5, 6-4, while Gar­bine Mugu­ruza beat Jo­hanna Konta 6-4, 6-1. Vic­to­ria Azarenka also ad­vanced af­ter her op­po­nent, Daria Kasatk­ina, retired.</p>
    <p>In the men’s draw, world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic sur­vived a scare against fel­low Serb Filip Kra­ji­novic.</p>
    <p>The 17-time Grand Slam cham­pion had to en­dure a tiebreak be­fore win­ning 7-6 (9-7), 6-3.</p>
    <p>The top seed is warm­ing up on clay in Rome for the French Open, a tour­na­ment he claimed in 2016.</p>
    <p>Djokovic – un­beaten this sea­son be­fore be­ing dis­qual­i­fied from the US Open – dou­ble faulted on the first of his three set points in the tiebreak but a quick break in the sec­ond set put him through in a tour­na­ment he has won four times.</p>
    <p>Q-fi­nals: Men (StarHub Ch211), women (Ch201), 6pm.</p>
    <p>TOO NEAR FOR COM­FORT</p>
    <p>My ham­string is still sore, so I won’t have enough time to pre­pare for the clay – these two tour­na­ments came too close to each other for me this year.</p>
    <p>NAOMI OSAKA, US Open cham­pion, on why she pulled out of the forth­com­ing French Open.</p>
