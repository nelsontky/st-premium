    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) will start three non-stop flights to New York’s John F. Kennedy In­ter­na­tional Air­port weekly in Novem­ber, amid “early signs of op­ti­mism about a re­cov­ery in air travel”.</p>
    <p>This new route will be the 41st des­ti­na­tion that SIA is op­er­at­ing flights to in the cur­rent cli­mate.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing this yes­ter­day, SIA said the flights will trans­port both pas­sen­gers and cargo.</p>
    <p>With the new route, the na­tional car­rier now op­er­ates two non-stop ser­vices to the United States, the other be­ing to Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>SIA said the ser­vice will be sup­ported by the grow­ing num­ber of trans­fer pas­sen­gers who can now tran­sit via Changi Air­port.</p>
    <p>The New York flight will also be the only non-stop air cargo link from the north-east of the US to Sin­ga­pore, which is a re­gional dis­tri­bu­tion hub for many ma­jor US-based com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>“SIA an­tic­i­pates sig­nif­i­cant cargo de­mand from a range of in­dus­tries based in the New York metro area, in­clud­ing phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, e-com­merce and tech­nol­ogy firms,” the air­line said.</p>
    <p>The New York flights will be­gin on Nov 9. Three non-stop flights weekly from John F. Kennedy In­ter­na­tional Air­port back to Sin­ga­pore will start two days later, on Nov 11.</p>
    <p>The Air­bus A-350-900 l on­grange air­craft, which will fly the route, has been con­fig­ured with 42 busi­ness class, 25 pre­mium econ­omy and 187 econ­omy class seats.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee Lik Hsin, ex­ec­u­tive vi­cepres­i­dent (com­mer­cial) of SIA, said the flights are an im­por­tant step in re­build­ing the air­line’s global network. “We will con­tinue to ramp up ex­ist­ing ser­vices and re­in­state other points as the de­mand for both pas­sen­ger and cargo ser­vices re­turn,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Our cus­tomers say they are in­creas­ingly con­fi­dent about air travel... That gives us con­fi­dence about the medium- to long-term prospects for the in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>In­de­pen­dent avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Bren­dan So­bie from So­bie Avi­a­tion said the New York flights are prob­a­bly a strate­gic move for “high-value cargo be­tween the two fi­nan­cial cen­tres” and “pre­mium pas­sen­gers”, given the con­tin­ued re­stric­tions on trav­ellers to the US.</p>
    <p>“It will be dif­fi­cult for SIA to make money from the flights,” he said, adding that he does not ex­pect the av­er­age pas­sen­ger load on the flights to ex­ceed 20 per cent of avail­able ca­pac­ity, which is sim­i­lar to SIA’s Los An­ge­les flights.</p>
    <p>Mr So­bie also noted that the ul­tra-long-range planes more suited for non-stop flights for such dis­tances have not been brought back, which means there will be re­stric­tions on the flight pay­load due to fuel con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore does not have spe­cial travel ar­range­ments with the United States.</p>
    <p>Changi Air­port, which was the sev­enth busiest air­port for in­ter­na­tional pas­sen­ger traf­fic be­fore Covid-19 struck, has fallen to 58th place this year. In Par­lia­ment, Min­is­ter for Trans­port Ong Ye Kung said there are today 49 di­rect flights to cities, com­pared with 160 pre­vi­ously.</p>
