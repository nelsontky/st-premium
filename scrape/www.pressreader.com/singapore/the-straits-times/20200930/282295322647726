    <p>Liver­pool man­ager Jur­gen Klopp hit back at pun­dit and for­mer Manch­ester United cap­tain Roy Keane after the Ir­ish­man said the Premier League cham­pi­ons’ de­fend­ing in a 3-1 home win over Arse­nal on Mon­day was “sloppy”.</p>
    <p>The Reds have won all three of their league games so far this sea­son, beat­ing Leeds 4-3 and win­ning 2-0 at Chelsea, but while prais­ing Klopp’s side Keane said they had shown the abil­ity to win while not be­ing per­fect in de­fend­ing.</p>
    <p>“Strangely enough if you look at</p>
    <p>Liver­pool, they have been sloppy against Leeds, OK done well against Chelsea, sloppy again tonight, but they have got nine points, max­i­mum points, so they will know they need to im­prove,” noted Keane.</p>
    <p>“It looks like they are ca­pa­ble of win­ning foot­ball matches with­out be­ing at their best.”</p>
    <p>Klopp pounced on those com­ments.</p>
    <p>“Did I hear it right, that Mr Keane said it was a sloppy per­for­mance tonight?” asked the Ger­man as he be­gan a post-match in­ter­view with</p>
    <p>Sky Sports. “I could hear you al­ready, did he say that?”</p>
    <p>After Keane at­tempted to ex­plain his re­marks, Klopp con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>“I just wanted to hear it. I’m not sure I heard it right, maybe he was speak­ing about another game... it can­not be this game, sorry!</p>
    <p>“That is an in­cred­i­ble de­scrip­tion of this game. Noth­ing was sloppy, ab­so­lutely noth­ing. Alis­son had to make one save, they had two balls in be­hind, you can­not avoid that. You need a goalie in th­ese sit­u­a­tions. Apart from that, the foot­ball we played was ab­so­lutely ex­cep­tional tonight. There is noth­ing bad to say. It was the op­po­site of sloppy.”</p>
    <p>Arse­nal had taken the lead through Alexan­dre La­cazette after poor con­trol from Andy Robert­son in his own area and the French striker could have equalised in the se­cond half when he was one-onone against goal­keeper Alis­son.</p>
    <p>But Klopp in­sisted he has been blown away by the stan­dards his team have set at the start of their ti­tle de­fence.</p>
    <p>Goals from Sa­dio Mane, Robert­son and new sign­ing Diogo Jota saw off the Gun­ners, who had won their open­ing two league games of the sea­son.</p>
    <p>While Manch­ester City, Chelsea, Manch­ester United, Tot­ten­ham and now Arse­nal have all lost in the first three weeks of the new term, Liver­pool have laid down an early</p>
    <p>marker that they are the team to beat.</p>
    <p>“It’s really early in the sea­son and with this per­for­mance it is ab­so­lutely ‘wow’,” said Klopp.</p>
    <p>“From the first se­cond, (we were) dom­i­nant against a team in form.”</p>
    <p>Arse­nal fol­lowed the game plan that had brought them two vic­to­ries over Liver­pool in re­cent months, as they dropped deep then looked to play around the Reds’ press when in pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, un­like when they met at the back end of last sea­son when Klopp’s men had al­ready won the league or the Com­mu­nity Shield last month, Liver­pool were far sharper in pulling the Gun­ners out of po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Arse­nal man­ager Mikel Arteta said that his team have lots of work to do to reach the Reds’ stan­dards.</p>
    <p>“We are in a dif­fer­ent jour­ney to Liver­pool. They’ve been to­gether for five years,” he said.</p>
    <p>“They have a lot of good work, a lot of belief in the way they play... This is what we have to try to do. We’re still a long way from get­ting there.”</p>
    <p>Liver­pool host Arse­nal again to­mor­row in the League Cup fourth round.</p>
    <p>Sloppy again tonight, but they have got nine points, max­i­mum points, so they will know they need to im­prove. It looks like they are ca­pa­ble of win­ning foot­ball matches with­out be­ing at their</p>
    <p>best.</p>
    <p>ROY KEANE, for­mer Manch­ester United mid­fielder, after Liver­pool con­ceded for a fourth time in the league this sea­son.</p>
    <p>WRONG CALL</p>
    <p>The foot­ball we played was ab­so­lutely ex­cep­tional tonight. There is noth­ing bad to say. It was</p>
    <p>the op­po­site of sloppy.</p>
    <p>JUR­GEN KLOPP, Liver­pool man­ager, dis­agree­ing with pun­dit Keane on the qual­ity of his team’s per­for­mance. The cham­pi­ons lim­ited in-form Arse­nal to four shots.</p>
