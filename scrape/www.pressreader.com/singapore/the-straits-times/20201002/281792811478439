    <p>LON­DON • Euro­pean reg­u­la­tors have started an ac­cel­er­ated re­view of a Covid-19 vac­cine front run­ner from the Univer­sity of Oxford and As­traZeneca in a sign the shot could be the first to seek ap­proval in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Medicines Agency (EMA) an­nounced the start of the so-called “rolling re­view”, an as­sess­ment typ­i­cally used in health emer­gen­cies to al­low reg­u­la­tors to see clin­i­cal trial data while the de­vel­op­ment is on­go­ing to speed up ap­provals.</p>
    <p>The move is a key step for­ward for the Oxford-As­traZeneca shot af­ter tri­als were halted last month due to concerns about a par­tic­i­pant in the Bri­tish study who be­came ill.</p>
    <p>The part­ners, along with com­pa­nies such as Pfizer and Moderna, are sprint­ing ahead with ex­per­i­men­tal shots as govern­ments look for a way out of the global cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The EMA said it is start­ing the re­view based on pre­lim­i­nary re­sults and that it does not mean “that a con­clu­sion can be reached yet on the vac­cine’s safety and ef­fec­tive­ness”.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for As­traZeneca said the com­pany wel­comed the de­vel­op­ment and will be pro­vid­ing the EMA with ac­cess to the vac­cine data as it be­comes avail­able.</p>
    <p>While the Bri­tish reg­u­la­tor cleared the Oxford-As­traZeneca trial to restart less than a week af­ter it was paused and stud­ies in South Africa, Brazil and In­dia have re­sumed, the United States au­thor­i­ties have yet to give the go-ahead.</p>
    <p>EMA head of vac­cines Marco Cava­leri said in July the agency would start rolling re­views of po­ten­tial can­di­dates af­ter the sum­mer.</p>
    <p>Dr Cava­leri said at the time the first ap­proval of a vac­cine could come by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>In a nor­mal en­vi­ron­ment, drug­mak­ers sub­mit trial data to the reg­u­la­tor for a re­view that can take many months.</p>
    <p>Once that is com­plete, an opin­ion is given on whether the prod­uct should be au­tho­rised for use, which must be signed off by the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion (EC).</p>
    <p>In emer­gen­cies like a pan­demic, a rolling re­view avoids de­lays so that an EMA rec­om­men­da­tion and ap­proval from the EC can be sought as quickly as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>The agency started such an eval­u­a­tion of remde­sivir to treat Covid-19 in April, while tri­als were on­go­ing, and the drug was given con­di­tional ap­proval three months later.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, early clin­i­cal tri­als of a sec­ond Rus­sian coro­n­avirus vac­cine have proved suc­cess­ful, its de­vel­oper said yes­ter­day, af­ter the coun­try boasted of ap­prov­ing the world’s first vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia’s Vek­tor – a top-se­cret state virol­ogy re­search cen­tre in Siberia – said early-stage tri­als were suc­cess­ful for its own ex­per­i­men­tal vac­cine, named EpiVacCoro­na.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian Health Min­is­ter Mikhail Murashko told Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin this week that Vek­tor’s vac­cine could be ap­proved by the min­istry in three weeks.</p>
    <p>While the Bri­tish reg­u­la­tor cleared the Oxford-As­traZeneca trial to restart less than a week af­ter it was paused and stud­ies in South Africa, Brazil and In­dia have re­sumed, the United States au­thor­i­ties have yet to give the go-ahead.</p>
