    <p>The late fash­ion pi­o­neer Pierre Cardin left a strong im­pres­sion on those in the fash­ion in­dus­try in Sin­ga­pore as well.</p>
    <p>Thomas Wee, 72, vet­eran cou­turier</p>
    <p>“When I was young and start­ing out in fash­ion in the 1960s, he was the big guy. He es­tab­lished him­self in ev­ery part of life­style with his name and sig­na­ture logo. Any­thing with that logo was an em­blem of pre­mium pres­tige.</p>
    <p>“He was known for his miniskirts as well as Space Age ac­ces­sories like gloves and boots. It was chic to wear Pierre Cardin.”</p>
    <p>Dick Lee, 64, singer, songwriter, fash­ion de­signer</p>
    <p>“Pierre Cardin was one of the de­sign­ers in the 1960s who was for­ward-think­ing and the cre­ator of Space Age fash­ion.</p>
    <p>“I was in­spired by his dar­ing­ness. He was one of the first de­sign­ers who broke out of the tra­di­tional cou­ture style that other de­sign­ers were do­ing dur­ing the 1950s and 1960s and, in­stead, fully em­braced mod­ernism and fu­tur­ism.”</p>
    <p>Ann Teoh, in her 50s, fash­ion de­signer</p>
    <p>“Pierre Cardin was an iconic de­signer who was also a very suc­cess­ful en­tre­pre­neur. It is rare since most artis­tic and cre­ative peo­ple are sel­dom savvy in busi­ness. He made a name for not just his fash­ion ap­parel but many other prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“His ini­tia­tives and en­ergy were much ad­mired and have in­spired me to think out of the box. He cer­tainly was a le­gend and I call him the grand­fa­ther of fash­ion.”</p>
    <p>Al­lan Chai, 68, fash­ion de­signer</p>
    <p>“Pierre Cardin’s avant-garde style in­spired me as a de­signer and I liked his for­ward-think­ing busi­ness ideas and how his brand was li­censed ex­ten­sively.”</p>
