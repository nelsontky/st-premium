    <p>When it comes to love and mar­riage, more cou­ples are not go­ing the dis­tance.</p>
    <p>Sig­nif­i­cantly fewer cou­ples tied the knot last year, while the num­ber of those end­ing their mar­riage was the high­est in at least 20 years.</p>
    <p>There were 25,434 mar­riages last year, about 6 per cent lower than the 27,007 cou­ples who said “I do” in 2018.</p>
    <p>In fact, the num­ber of cou­ples who mar­ried last year was the low­est since 2010, when 24,363 cou­ples reg­is­tered their mar­riages.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 7,623 cou­ples di­vorced or an­nulled their mar­riages last year, up by about 4 per cent from the 7,344 cou­ples who went sep­a­rate ways in 2018.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cou­ples who di­vorced or an­nulled their mar­riages last year was the high­est in at least 20 years. In 1999, 5,314 cou­ples ended their mar­riages.</p>
    <p>The data was from the Sta­tis­tics on Mar­riages and Di­vorces 2019 re­port that the Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ol­o­gists and coun­sel­lors note that as Sin­ga­pore­ans spend more years get­ting an ed­u­ca­tion and build­ing their ca­reers, more are also mar­ry­ing at a later age.</p>
    <p>The me­dian age at first mar­riage for men rose from 29.8 years in 2009 to 30.4 years last year, while it went up from 27.5 years in 2009 to 28.8 years last year for women.</p>
    <p>About three in four mar­riages last year were the first for both hus­band and wife.</p>
    <p>And the num­ber of in­ter-eth­nic mar­riages con­tin­ues to rise: About 23 per cent of all mar­riages were between cou­ples of dif­fer­ent races last year, up from about 18 per cent in 2009.</p>
    <p>Dr Ko Pei-Chun, lec­turer at the Cen­tre for Univer­sity Core, Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences, said at­ti­tudes to­wards mar­riage are shift­ing from tra­di­tional norms to more open ones, which could ac­count for the larger num­ber of in­ter-eth­nic mar­riages.</p>
    <p>Dr Ko said: “In­creas­ing in­ter-eth­nic mar­riages may re­flect the op­por­tu­ni­ties of cul­tural in­te­gra­tion, which may en­hance di­ver­si­ties of so­ci­ety in the long run.”</p>
    <p>So­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser said the fall in the num­ber of mar­riages could be due to a va­ri­ety of fac­tors.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the econ­omy is not do­ing well and some cou­ples feel they can­not af­ford to buy a flat and set­tle down.</p>
    <p>More cou­ples may choose not to marry, but co-habit in­stead.</p>
    <p>He said: “There is a shift in so­cial val­ues to­wards ap­proval of co­hab­i­ta­tion.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the num­ber of mar­ried cou­ples call­ing it quits is rising.</p>
    <p>The me­dian length of mar­riages among cou­ples who di­vorced last year was 10.4 years, up slightly from 10.1 years in 2009.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the greater ac­cep­tance of di­vorce, there are mul­ti­ple rea­sons why di­vorces are on the rise, those in­ter­viewed said.</p>
    <p>Fo­cus on the Fam­ily’s prin­ci­pal coun­sel­lor Theresa Pong said: “Many mar­ried cou­ples, in the midst of bal­anc­ing mul­ti­ple re­spon­si­bil­i­ties and roles, would place their mar­riages on the back­seat, putting greater pri­or­ity on other as­pects of life such as ca­reer, fi­nances and even par­ent­ing.</p>
    <p>“With­out in­ten­tional ef­fort in in­vest­ing in the mar­i­tal re­la­tion­ship, this can of­ten lead to an in­crease in un­met ex­pec­ta­tions between cou­ples and a va­ri­ety of mar­i­tal is­sues that may re­sult in di­vorce.”</p>
    <p>With fewer mar­riages and more di­vorces, the num­ber of ba­bies born could drop even more as Sin­ga­pore strug­gles with a per­sis­tent baby drought and a rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion, those in­ter­viewed said.</p>
    <p>To re­duce the num­ber of di­vorces, coun­sel­lors said, more needs to be done to pre­pare cou­ples for mar­riage or to coun­sel cou­ples in cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Ms Keely Ng, a 27-year-old part­ner­ship ex­ec­u­tive in a char­ity, mar­ried com­pli­ance of­fi­cer Phua Tai Wee, 32, last year.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple met dur­ing a Muay Thai class and dated for about two years be­fore say­ing “I do”.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng has three sib­lings and she basks in the warmth and in­ter­ac­tion found in a large fam­ily.</p>
    <p>She hopes to have two or three chil­dren and to ex­pand her fam­ily in the near fu­ture when she is still young and en­er­getic. She said: “We feel we are ready (for mar­riage) as we share the same goals and dreams.”</p>
