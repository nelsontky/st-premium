    <p>How much of a fire risk are elec­tric ve­hi­cles (EVs)? What would cause such fires and is there any­thing an EV owner can do in or­der to mit­i­gate this risk?</p>
    <p>EVs are not ex­actly new. Some of the very first cars were bat­tery-pow­ered. Be­cause of es­ca­lat­ing en­vi­ron­ment con­cerns, they are mak­ing a come­back.</p>
    <p>For the gen­eral pub­lic, these cars are novel. Hence, news about EVs tend to be sen­sa­tion­alised.</p>
    <p>EV fires, for in­stance, make head­lines. Un­for­tu­nately, there is no in­de­pen­dent data on how com­mon EV fires are vis-a-vis their pop­u­la­tion. Most re­ports cite ab­so­lute num­bers, which are not mean­ing­ful since EVs still make up a tiny per­cent­age of a coun­try’s to­tal ve­hi­cle pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Most EV fires oc­cur as a re­sult of se­ri­ous crashes. But such fires are not unique to EVs.</p>
    <p>Com­bus­tion-en­gined cars carry liq­uid fu­els, and petrol is highly flammable. So, in bad ac­ci­dents, the com­bi­na­tion of leak­ing fuel and hot ex­haust (or short cir­cuit) can lead to a spon­ta­neous fire.</p>
    <p>The dif­fer­ence is that EV fires pro­duce very nox­ious fumes and are harder to put out. There have been re­ports where fires which had been put out re-ig­nited hours or even days later.</p>
    <p>There have been some news lately of EV fires due to manufactur­ing de­fects of bat­tery packs. But such fires are not ram­pant and man­u­fac­tur­ers have been rel­a­tively quick to act to rec­tify the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Cases of fires at home while charg­ing an EV or even plug-in hybrid are ac­tu­ally more com­mon.</p>
    <p>Some of these are caused by peo­ple us­ing ex­ten­sion cords to charge their EVs. This is a bad idea, as these cords are made for low-load home ap­pli­ances. When used for an EV, they can eas­ily over­heat.</p>
    <p>It is al­ways rec­om­mended that a ded­i­cated wall box be used for EV charg­ing.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic charg­ing points are pur­pose-built for EVs and are safe. They will be­come increasing­ly com­mon in the next 10 years.</p>
