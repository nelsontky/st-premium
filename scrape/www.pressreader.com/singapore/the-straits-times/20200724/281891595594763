    <p>PORT­LAND • Wear­ing bike hel­mets and yel­low T-shirts, Amer­ica’s mothers are con­fronting fed­eral agents in combat gear to pro­tect anti-racism pro­test­ers in Port­land and, soon, other US cities where Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has vowed a crack­down.</p>
    <p>“Wall of Moms” groups have formed in at least six cities in­clud­ing New York and Chicago in the four days since mainly white sub­ur­ban mothers in Port­land started form­ing hu­man walls in front of demon­stra­tors.</p>
    <p>Car­ry­ing signs like “Feds stay clear. Moms are here”, and “I’m so dis­ap­pointed in you – mom”, the women in Port­land, Ore­gon, have been shoved and tear-gassed by agents. Some fa­thers have joined the mothers, bring­ing leaf blow­ers to blow away tear gas.</p>
    <p>Im­ages of fed­eral agents in cam­ou­flage whisk­ing away Port­land pro­test­ers in un­marked ve­hi­cles last week mo­bilised the mothers.</p>
    <p>Protests against racial in­jus­tice have rocked the largely white city for nearly two months since the death in po­lice cus­tody of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, an African Amer­i­can, in Min­neapo­lis.</p>
    <p>The de­ploy­ment of fed­eral agents in Port­land last week is a flash­point in a na­tional de­bate over civil lib­er­ties and what demon­stra­tors and lo­cal of­fi­cials see as a po­lit­i­cal ploy by Mr Trump, who is fac­ing an uphill re-elec­tion battle.</p>
    <p>“This was a call to ac­tion. I was hon­est, and I said I didn’t know how to protest but I knew some­thing had to be done,” said Ms Bev Barnum, a 35-year-old Port­land mother of two who used Face­book to or­gan­ise the group’s first demon­stra­tion of sev­eral dozen mothers.</p>
    <p>Car­ry­ing sun­flow­ers, large peace sym­bol cut-outs and signs like “You need a time-out”, hun­dreds of mothers now link arms on the front line of nightly protests at the city’s fed­eral court­house, brav­ing tear gas and other non-lethal mu­ni­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump threat­ened ear­lier this week to send FBI and other fed­eral agents to other cities to help crack down on a surge in vi­o­lence in re­cent weeks. The pro­gramme, known as Op­er­a­tion Legend, be­gan in Kansas City, Mis­souri.</p>
    <p>A Wall of Moms group in Wash­ing­ton called on mothers to gather at the “March Against Trump’s Po­lice State” on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Chicago or­gan­iser Katje Sabin, 57, said her group had been asked to at­tend a Satur­day protest. “If we have these groups of mums in yoga pants stand­ing there, peo­ple kind of be­have a lit­tle bet­ter,” she said of po­lice who she be­lieves want peace­ful protests but get “all ex­cited and threat­ened and scared”.</p>
    <p>Port­land’s mothers had thought of­fi­cers from the Depart­ment of</p>
    <p>Home­land Se­cu­rity and other fed­eral agen­cies would not use force against them at their first demon­stra­tion on Sun­day at the court­house. They were wrong.</p>
    <p>“We got gassed and that was the most heinous, ex­cru­ci­at­ing ex­pe­ri­ence in my life,” said Ms Barnum.</p>
    <p>The Wall of Moms move­ment car­ries on a tra­di­tion of ma­ter­nal ac­tivism, no­tably the Mothers of the</p>
    <p>Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires who held weekly vig­ils for nearly three decades to spot­light the dis­ap­pear­ance of their chil­dren un­der a mil­i­tary dic­ta­tor­ship.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, drones have been banned from fly­ing near fed­eral build­ings in Port­land, with of­fi­cials say­ing they be­lieve fed­eral of­fi­cers have been surveilled by drones dur­ing protests against po­lice vi­o­lence, a Depart­ment of Home­land Se­cu­rity (DHS) spokesman said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Au­thor­ity has banned drone flights be­low 305m within 1.85km of Port­land’s Edith Green-Wen­dell Wy­att Fed­eral Build­ing and the US Fed­eral Court­house at DHS’ re­quest, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>These build­ings have been a fo­cal point of protests for sev­eral weeks, and the fed­eral gov­ern­ment has come un­der crit­i­cism in re­cent days for its tough re­sponse to the protests.</p>
    <p>In New York, po­lice cleared a camp of anti-racism pro­test­ers and homeless peo­ple from out­side city hall on Wed­nes­day, af­ter Mr Trump threat­ened to send fed­eral agents to bol­ster law en­force­ment in Amer­ica’s largest city.</p>
    <p>The city’s of­fi­cers – ac­com­pa­nied by clean­ers and lawyers – dis­man­tled the tents just be­fore dawn, driv­ing away around 50 demon­stra­tors with­out clashes or in­juries, po­lice chief Der­mot Shea told re­porters.</p>
    <p>MOTHERS UNITED</p>
    <p>This was a call to ac­tion. I was hon­est, and I said I didn’t know how to protest but I knew some­thing had ’’ to be done.</p>
