    <p>Demo­cratic can­di­date Joe Bi­den has taken the lead in the cru­cial bat­tle­ground states of Ge­or­gia and Penn­syl­va­nia over Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, putting him on the cusp of vic­tory in the United States pres­i­den­tial race. Mr Trump was trail­ing yes­ter­day in all the out­stand­ing swing states, ex­cept North Carolina.</p>
    <p>Three days af­ter elec­tion day on Nov 3, Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den moved into the lead in the cru­cial bat­tle­ground states of Penn­syl­va­nia and Ge­or­gia yes­ter­day, putting him on track to win the pres­i­dency and po­ten­tially cut­ting off Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re­main­ing paths to vic­tory.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was trail­ing in all the out­stand­ing swing states that have not been called ex­cept for North Carolina, which Mr Bi­den does not need to reach the 270 elec­toral votes re­quired to win the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The Trump cam­paign did not take the news ly­ing down, re­leas­ing a state­ment shortly af­ter­wards that re­jected the num­bers and re­peated the claim that Mr Trump would be re-elected.</p>
    <p>“This elec­tion is not over,” said cam­paign lawyer Matt Mor­gan.</p>
    <p>“The false pro­jec­tion of Joe Bi­den as the win­ner is based on re­sults in four states that are far from fi­nal.”</p>
    <p>Penn­syl­va­nia was al­ways the prize for the Bi­den-Ka­mala Har­ris ticket, and its 20 elec­toral votes would put Mr Bi­den over the top with the states he now holds.</p>
    <p>He pulled ahead in the north­east­ern state that Mr Trump cap­tured in 2016 just be­fore 9am East­ern Time (10pm Sin­ga­pore time), when more re­sults were re­leased that put him at 5,600 votes, or 0.1 point, ahead of the Pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s lead had steadily eroded over the last few days as votes from heav­ily Demo­cratic Philadel­phia and its sur­round­ing ar­eas were counted.</p>
    <p>By press time past mid­night, Mr Bi­den’s lead had widened to 8,867, with more votes still to be counted.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den was also 1,585 votes ahead of Mr Trump in Ge­or­gia – which has 16 elec­toral votes – where 99 per cent of the votes have been counted.</p>
    <p>Aside from Ge­or­gia and Penn­syl­va­nia, votes were still be­ing counted in Ne­vada, where he widened his lead overnight, and Ari­zona. In Ari­zona, Mr Trump nar­rowed Mr Bi­den’s lead to about 43,000 votes, or 1.4 points, but he will need about 60 per cent of the re­main­ing votes to over­take Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>With votes con­tin­u­ing to be tal­lied amid these ra­zor-thin mar­gins, the for­mer vice-pres­i­dent urged pa­tience on Thurs­day and re­jected Mr Trump’s un­sub­stan­ti­ated claims of voter fraud made in an ad­dress to the na­tion from the White House.</p>
    <p>“The peo­ple will not be si­lenced, be bul­lied or sur­ren­der. Ev­ery vote must be counted,” Mr Bi­den wrote on Twit­ter. “No one is go­ing to take our democ­racy away from us. Not now, not ever. Amer­ica has come too far, fought too many bat­tles and en­dured too much to let that hap­pen.”</p>
    <p>Asked for his re­sponse to re­ports that Mr Trump had no plans to con­cede the elec­tion, Bi­den cam­paign spokesman An­drew Bates said: “As we said on July 19, the Amer­i­can peo­ple will de­cide this elec­tion. And the United States gov­ern­ment is per­fectly ca­pa­ble of es­cort­ing tres­passers out of the White House.”</p>
    <p>As count­ing con­tin­ued in the hand­ful of states still re­main­ing, Amer­i­cans ral­lied in sup­port of both the Pres­i­dent and Mr Bi­den, ei­ther de­mand­ing a stop to the count out­side vot­ing cen­tres or that ev­ery vote be tal­lied.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den was also solidly ahead in the pop­u­lar vote, with yes­ter­day morn­ing’s count show­ing that 73.5 mil­lion Amer­i­cans, or 50.5 per cent, voted for him, while 69.6 mil­lion, or 47.9 per cent, voted for Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>The US Se­cret Ser­vice, which is in charge of pro­tect­ing Amer­ica’s top lead­ers, sent more agents to Wilmington, Delaware, where Mr Bi­den lives, in an­tic­i­pa­tion of his po­ten­tial win, The Wash­ing­ton Post and CNN re­ported.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the Fed­eral Avi­a­tion Ad­min­is­tra­tion posted a one­mile-ra­dius no-fly zone over Mr Bi­den’s home.</p>
