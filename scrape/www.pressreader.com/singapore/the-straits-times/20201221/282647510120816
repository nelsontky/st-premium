    <p>MY World Preschool’s first cen­tre – in Stevens Road – opened in 1980 un­der its par­ent or­gan­i­sa­tion, Metropoli­tan YMCA.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre no longer op­er­ates as a pre-school and now serves as MY World’s head­quar­ters, but the op­er­a­tor has since ex­panded across the is­land and has 3,600 chil­dren in 41 cen­tres, mostly in Hous­ing Board estates.</p>
    <p>MY World Preschool has been an an­chor op­er­a­tor since 2014, which means the monthly fee is $720 for full-day childcare and $1,275 for full-day in­fant care for Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>Three more cen­tres are sched­uled to open next year, in Bukit Ba­tok West Plains, Tampines GreenView and Yishun Val­ley Spring.</p>
    <p>WHAT THE PRE-SCHOOLS OF­FER</p>
    <p>Ms Jane Choy, MY World’s head of op­er­a­tions, says its ap­proach to teach­ing en­cour­ages chil­dren to learn through par­tic­i­pa­tion, ex­plo­ration, in­quiry and re­flec­tion.</p>
    <p>They are pro­gres­sively ex­posed to dif­fer­ent learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ences, she adds.</p>
    <p>Younger chil­dren learn more through ex­plo­ration dur­ing un­in­ter­rupted play, while older ones are en­cour­aged to ask ques­tions, ob­serve, ex­per­i­ment and talk about what they have picked up. They then im­ple­ment what they have</p>
    <p>learnt through hands-on ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Along with spa­ces for group ac­tiv­i­ties, our teach­ers de­sign learn­ing spa­ces for small group ac­tiv­i­ties that en­cour­age chil­dren to ex­plore and ex­per­i­ment in­de­pen­dently,” says Ms Choy.</p>
    <p>Such ac­tiv­i­ties may in­clude dis­cussing with their peers what they have learnt about a given</p>
    <p>topic, cre­at­ing crafts or posters, a show-and-tell ses­sion or putting on a skit.</p>
    <p>Ms Choy adds that MY World cen­tres have weaved en­vi­ron­men­tal top­ics like up­cy­cling and re­cy­cling into lessons, which is be­ing done through vir­tual teach­ing tools and field trips along with craft ses­sions, given the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ac­tiv­i­ties in­clude us­ing re­cy­cled ma­te­ri­als such as card­board and bot­tles for craft ses­sions, as well as gar­den­ing and learn­ing about the nat­u­ral habi­tats and life cy­cles of in­sects and an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>Some cen­tres have eco-gar­dens and “worm ho­tels”, struc­tures that are homes to worms and com­post, to back up the lessons.</p>
