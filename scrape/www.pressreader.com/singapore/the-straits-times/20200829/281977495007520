    <p>When Malaysia went into a par­tial lock­down in March due to a sud­den spike of coro­n­avirus cases, sin­gle par­ent Naimah Su­da­ian was left with­out a job and with zero sav­ings to sur­vive the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>With three chil­dren to raise, the 49-year-old was dumb­founded by how she was go­ing to af­ford rent and gro­ceries af­ter be­ing laid off as a se­cu­rity guard later that month.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber go­ing home that day, cry­ing. I have no sav­ings to get me go­ing and with my last pay cheque of RM1,200 (S$392), I care­fully planned our ex­penses,” Madam Naimah told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“We had to ra­tion our food and sur­vive mostly on crack­ers and in­stant noo­dles. Oc­ca­sion­ally, we’d have rice and eggs be­cause that’s the cheap­est ‘real meal’ we can af­ford,” she said.</p>
    <p>She is not alone in strug­gling to make ends meet dur­ing the move­ment con­trol or­der (MCO) to curb the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Re­search by United Na­tions agen­cies found that house­holds with fam­ily heads earn­ing be­low RM2,000 a month tend to spend more on eggs (52 per cent) and in­stant noo­dles (40 per cent), and less on pro­tein and rice, com­pared with those earn­ing above the bracket.</p>
    <p>When Malaysia first im­posed move­ment curbs on March 18, it forced schools and non-es­sen­tial busi­nesses to tem­po­rar­ily shut down. Peo­ple were con­fined to their homes, ex­cept to buy food and es­sen­tial items or to seek med­i­cal treat­ment.</p>
    <p>Th­ese con­trols were eased on May 4, al­low­ing most busi­nesses to reopen and peo­ple to travel for work.</p>
    <p>But de­spite life hav­ing re­turned to nor­mal in most cases in Malaysia, the im­pact of the MCO has been dam­ag­ing.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the UN study ti­tled Fam­i­lies On The Edge, low-in­come house­holds headed by women, like wid­ows and sin­gle moth­ers, are among the worst af­fected, with higher rates of un­em­ploy­ment and pes­simistic out­look on prospects for recovery in the next six months.</p>
    <p>And al­though there are var­i­ous gov­ern­ment aid schemes amid the MCO, cash as­sis­tance is re­garded as the most use­ful, and the re­spon­dents pre­fer sus­tain­able as­sis­tance such as em­ploy­ment and longert­erm aid rather than just one-off cash hand­outs.</p>
    <p>“Cash hand­outs help, but one-off as­sis­tance is not sus­tain­able. In par­tic­u­lar, they want jobs. So it is not a (cul­ture of ask­ing for gov­ern­ment hand­outs),” Malaysia-based pub­lic pol­icy re­search out­fit DM An­a­lyt­ics man­ag­ing direc­tor Muhammed Ab­dul Khalid told fi­nan­cial news site The Edge on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“They are very proud, re­spon­si­ble and ra­tio­nal peo­ple,” he added.</p>
    <p>The re­search – on a sam­ple of 500 house­holds with chil­dren in Kuala Lumpur’s low-cost flats – also re­vealed that the ur­ban poor were forced to cut back spend­ing on their chil­dren’s ed­u­ca­tion by as much as 84 per cent.</p>
    <p>Chil­dren liv­ing in th­ese house­holds are at risk of de­te­ri­o­rat­ing di­etary qual­ity due to changes in their food con­sump­tion and a wors­en­ing of ed­u­ca­tion out­comes due to chal­lenges in ac­cess­ing home-based on­line learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, Unicef Malaysia’s so­cial pol­icy chief, Mr Stephen Bar­rett, said a large pro­por­tion of low-in­come chil­dren face more chal­lenges when they even­tu­ally go back to schools af­ter the MCO.</p>
    <p>“...It is a known fact that hun­gry chil­dren do not learn prop­erly. So there is a risk that low-in­come chil­dren may end up not go­ing back to school,” Mr Bar­rett was quoted as say­ing by the Malay Mail On­line news site.</p>
