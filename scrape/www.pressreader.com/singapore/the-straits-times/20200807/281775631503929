    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo has shrugged off China’s ob­jec­tions to the planned visit by Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Sec­re­tary Alex Azar to Tai­wan, say­ing it was not in­con­sis­tent with pre­vi­ous pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“Cab­i­net mem­bers have trav­elled to Tai­wan pre­vi­ously,” Mr Pom­peo said on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Azar is “go­ing there with a deep and im­por­tant pur­pose. We’re still in a global pandemic”, he said, adding: “Tai­wan has had some sig­nif­i­cant suc­cess in how they have han­dled this. We have wanted them to be part of the con­ver­sa­tions at the World Health Assem­bly... China has pre­vented that from hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>“And so he’ll go there and talk to them about pub­lic health is­sues as they re­late to how we all move for­ward with re­spect to how we han­dle Covid and the op­por­tu­nity for ther­a­peu­tics and a vac­cine... We wel­come the ex­per­tise that Tai­wan brings to that.”</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s re­marks, in answer to a ques­tion at a me­dia brief­ing, came hours af­ter a sharp re­ac­tion from China to the planned visit.</p>
    <p>Mr Azar will be the first US Cab­i­net of­fi­cial to visit Tai­wan since a 2014 trip by the then ad­min­is­tra­tor of the En­vi­ron­men­tal Pro­tec­tion Agency Gina McCarthy – the high­est-rank­ing Cab­i­net mem­ber to make a visit since Tai­wan and the US cut for­mal ties in 1979.</p>
    <p>Mr Azar will meet med­i­cal ex­perts and front-line health work­ers han­dling Covid-19 cases, and also meet Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen, For­eign Min­is­ter Joseph Wu, and Health and Wel­fare Min­is­ter Chen Shih-chung.</p>
    <p>The US of­fi­cially fol­lows the “One China” pol­icy – not recog­nis­ing Tai­wan as an in­de­pen­dent en­tity, but main­tain­ing trade and busi­ness ties and sup­ply­ing the is­land with weapons.</p>
    <p>China con­sid­ers Tai­wan a rene­gade prov­ince which will one day re­unify with the main­land.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, in Bei­jing, Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin said: “China firmly op­poses of­fi­cial ex­changes be­tween the United States and Tai­wan.”</p>
    <p>He called for the US to keep to the “One China” principle and not send “wrong sig­nals” to pro-in­de­pen­dence ad­vo­cates in Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Mr Azar, in a state­ment, said: “Tai­wan has been a model of trans­parency and co­op­er­a­tion in global health dur­ing the Covid-19 pandemic and long be­fore it.”</p>
    <p>He added: “I look for­ward to con­vey­ing Pres­i­dent (Don­ald) Trump’s sup­port for Tai­wan’s global health lead­er­ship and un­der­scor­ing our shared be­lief that free and demo­cratic so­ci­eties are the best model for pro­tect­ing and pro­mot­ing health.”</p>
    <p>While Mr Azar’s visit is fo­cused on health and the pandemic, it is dif­fi­cult to sep­a­rate from the wider con­text of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s paint­ing of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party as a ma­lig­nant ac­tor and threat to democ­ra­cies.</p>
    <p>Just days ago, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion said it wanted to ban or force the sale of TikTok, the pop­u­lar short video-shar­ing plat­form owned by the Chi­nese firm ByteDance, in what Bei­jing has called a “smash and grab”.</p>
    <p>“Broadly... in eco­nomic ar­eas, en­hanced ties is not re­ally a prob­lem, and a US-Tai­wan Free Trade Agree­ment may be a good idea,” Dr Robert Man­ning, res­i­dent se­nior fel­low at the At­lantic Coun­cil’s Scowcroft Cen­tre for Strat­egy and Se­cu­rity, told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“But the larger con­text of China oblit­er­at­ing the ‘one coun­try, two sys­tems’ myth in Hong Kong, al­ways de­rided in Tai­wan; du­elling mil­i­tary ex­er­cises in the South China Sea and off Tai­wan; and (Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s) hy­per­na­tion­al­ist as­sertive­ness across the board, not least rum­blings in China of ac­tion on Tai­wan, make the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion par­tic­u­larly dicey.</p>
    <p>“And of course, hav­ing the Sec­re­tary of State give a ma­jor speech… all but call­ing for regime change, doesn’t help ei­ther,” Dr Man­ning added, re­fer­ring to a July 23 speech by Mr Pom­peo in which he called for the “free world” to stand up to com­mu­nist China.</p>
    <p>Ms Yun Sun, se­nior fel­low and direc­tor of the China Pro­gramme at the Stim­son Cen­tre in Washington, told The Straits Times: “A visit by a Cab­i­net mem­ber does not con­sti­tute aban­don­ment of US strate­gic am­bi­gu­ity, and does not con­sti­tute the recog­ni­tion of Tai­wan as an in­de­pen­dent coun­try.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think China should re­act bel­liger­ently… al­though I know it will, per­haps by more mil­i­tary moves on the Tai­wan Strait and around Tai­wan is­land.”</p>
    <p>She added: “But I don’t think overt mil­i­tary takeover or a mil­i­tary con­flict over Tai­wan is in the Chi­nese cards.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter all, they are wait­ing for the Nov 3 elec­tion to change the US pres­i­dent and its China pol­icy. Get­ting into a con­flict now will not serve that pur­pose.”</p>
    <p>DEEP PUR­POSE</p>
    <p>He’s go­ing there with a deep and im­por­tant pur­pose. We’re still in a global pandemic. Tai­wan has had some sig­nif­i­cant suc­cess in how they have han­dled this.</p>
    <p>’’ U.S. SEC­RE­TARY OF STATE MIKE POM­PEO, on Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Sec­re­tary Alex Azar’s trip to Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>HEALTH LEAD­ER­SHIP</p>
    <p>Tai­wan has been a model of trans­parency and co­op­er­a­tion in global health dur­ing the Covid-19 pandemic and long be­fore it. I look for­ward to con­vey­ing Pres­i­dent (Don­ald) Trump’s sup­port for Tai­wan’s global health lead­er­ship and un­der­scor­ing our shared be­lief that free and demo­cratic so­ci­eties are the best model for pro­tect­ing and pro­mot­ing health.</p>
    <p>’’ MR AZAR, in a state­ment on his visit.</p>
