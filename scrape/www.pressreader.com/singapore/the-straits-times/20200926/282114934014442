    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has has­tened Sin­ga­pore’s pace of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion, but the next step is to move from be­ing a na­tion of tech­nol­ogy con­sumers to a na­tion of tech­nol­ogy pro­duc­ers, Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Smart Na­tion ini­tia­tive Vi­vian Balakr­ish­nan said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing dur­ing a vir­tual di­a­logue with 100 Smart Na­tion am­bas­sadors, he re­called how be­ing bad at video games pushed him to learn pro­gram­ming.</p>
    <p>“When I first started with com­put­ers, I quickly re­alised I was a very lousy gamer, and my main im­pe­tus for learn­ing pro­gram­ming was to hack the game in or­der to im­prove my scores,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I do worry some­times if we will all end up be­com­ing gamers, but not (peo­ple) ca­pa­ble of pro­duc­ing those games. And that’s why this point about be­com­ing a na­tion of tech pro­duc­ers res­onates very strongly with me.”</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s ses­sion was the first of three di­a­logues with Smart Na­tion am­bas­sadors to seek their views on Sin­ga­pore’s tech­nol­ogy push. The other two will be held next Mon­day and Thurs­day, with Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health and Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion Janil Puthuc­heary and Per­ma­nent Sec­re­tary (Smart Na­tion and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment) Ng Chee Kh­ern re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently more than 1,600 Smart Na­tion am­bas­sadors who coach and guide oth­ers in the use of tech­nol­ogy in their daily lives.</p>
    <p>Dr Balakr­ish­nan thanked them for their ef­forts, while also call­ing on them to give “frank, rel­e­vant and ac­tion­able” feed­back that will be de­vel­oped fur­ther by the SG To­gether ac­tion net­works launched in June.</p>
    <p>“This is our com­mit­ment to joint ac­tion... Rather than the Gov­ern­ment com­ing up with all the pre­scrip­tive de­tailed so­lu­tions, I think we should spend our time de­scrib­ing the prob­lem,” he said.</p>
    <p>“(It’s about) shar­ing the chal­lenge with the com­mu­nity (and the cor­po­rate sec­tor) and say­ing ‘Guys, how about you come up with the so­lu­tion’... If you have got a bet­ter idea or so­lu­tion, let’s test it, let’s pi­lot it and im­ple­ment it.”</p>
    <p>He added that he is look­ing for­ward to a fu­ture where the Gov­ern­ment and the com­mu­nity are cocre­at­ing and re-imag­in­ing new ser­vices “all the time”.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the vir­tual di­a­logue, par­tic­i­pants were di­vided into small groups for dis­cus­sion, with each group later pre­sent­ing its ideas.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of how to make tech­nol­ogy more ac­ces­si­ble, in­clu­sive and trans­par­ent for all dom­i­nated dis­cus­sions, with some par­tic­i­pants em­pha­sis­ing the im­por­tance of the hu­man touch in de­liv­er­ing such mes­sages.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers said they ap­pre­ci­ated the Gov.sg What­sApp chan­nel that pro­vides Covid-19 up­dates, prais­ing it for its reg­u­lar­ity and trans­parency, while ex­press­ing a hope that the same could be ex­tended fur­ther across all dig­i­tal outreach ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Smart Na­tion am­bas­sador Alice Yu, 28, said the Gov­ern­ment did well in re­sponse to the Covid-19 out­break by swiftly or­gan­is­ing the dis­tri­bu­tion of masks and rolling out a range of dig­i­tal ser­vices such as TraceTo­gether “in a few weeks”.</p>
    <p>“But with so much tech­nol­ogy com­ing into our lives, there can be a lot of mis­un­der­stand­ing and mis­com­mu­ni­ca­tion about what it means for us,” added Ms Yu.</p>
    <p>She is founder of com­mu­nity group Mama on Pal­ette, which helps equip ar­tis­ti­cally in­clined stay-at-home moth­ers with dig­i­tal tools to pro­mote their work.</p>
    <p>“Some might be afraid too, so pub­lic aware­ness and ed­u­ca­tion is very im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“My hope is for ev­ery­one in Sin­ga­pore to have a fair and ba­sic un­der­stand­ing of tech­nol­ogy,” she added.</p>
