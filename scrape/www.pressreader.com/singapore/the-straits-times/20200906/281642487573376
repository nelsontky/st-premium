    <p>Three new clus­ters of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions – all in dor­mi­to­ries – were an­nounced by the Min­istry of Health (MOH) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Cochrane Lodge I, Mandai Lodge I and Tuas South Dor­mi­tory were linked to nine, 17 and 11 ear­lier con­firmed cases re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Water­way Point and The Sele­tar Mall were the lat­est to be added to the list of places vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>There were three com­mu­nity cases yes­ter­day, com­pris­ing one Sin­ga­porean and two work per­mit hold­ers. MOH said all three cases are cur­rently un­linked and asymp­to­matic, and were de­tected through proac­tive test­ing.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean had trav­elled to Malaysia but was de­nied en­try at the air­port due to ad­min­is­tra­tive rea­sons. He tested neg­a­tive while in Malaysia, and was placed on stay-home no­tice at a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore the next day. He sub­se­quently tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing his stay-home no­tice.</p>
    <p>The other two cases were de­tected as a re­sult of ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion, marine and process sec­tors who are liv­ing out­side the dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>There were two i mported cases, both Sin­ga­pore­ans who tested pos­i­tive while serv­ing their stay-home no­tices. The first re­turned from In­dia on Aug 24 and the other from Australia on Aug 25.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 29 of the 34 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,982.</p>
    <p>Among the 29, 14 were iden­ti­fied ear­lier as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases, and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 15 cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as bi­weekly ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited them to get peo­ple who were at those places to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from when they were there.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied, and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 50 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, with none i n i nten­sive care, while 638 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break, which be­gan in De­cem­ber last year, has in­fected more than 26.8 mil­lion peo­ple. More than 880,000 peo­ple have died.</p>
