    <p>Five In­dian states have pro­posed new laws on forced reli­gious con­ver­sions around mar­riage, fu­elling the “love ji­had” con­spir­acy the­ory which claims that Mus­lim men are car­ry­ing out an or­gan­ised cam­paign to con­vert women to Is­lam. The love ji­had de­bate fol­lows a Hindu woman’s mur­der in Haryana.</p>
    <p>Five In­dian states have pro­posed new laws on forced reli­gious con­ver­sions around mar­riage, fu­elling the “love ji­had” con­spir­acy the­ory which claims that Mus­lim men are car­ry­ing out an or­gan­ised cam­paign to con­vert women to Is­lam.</p>
    <p>On Oct 31, Hindu cleric Yogi Adityanath, who is chief min­is­ter of the north­ern state of Ut­tar Pradesh, In­dia’s most pop­u­lous state, thun­dered at an election rally: “The govern­ment is tak­ing a de­ci­sion to stop love ji­had… I warn those who con­ceal their iden­ti­ties and dis­re­spect our sis­ters. If you don’t mend your ways, your fu­ner­als will be­gin soon.”</p>
    <p>Mr Adityanath has railed against love ji­had for years, claim­ing that the cam­paign is an in­ter­na­tional con­spir­acy to make Mus­lims more pop­u­lous in In­dia.</p>
    <p>On Nov 1, the chief min­is­ter of Haryana, an­other north­ern state, told jour­nal­ists his govern­ment was con­sid­er­ing sim­i­lar mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Two days later, the leader of the cen­tral In­dian state of Mad­hya Pradesh said: “There will be no ji­had in the name of love, who­ever does such an act will be set right.”</p>
    <p>The same day, the tourism min­is­ter of Kar­nataka tweeted that the south­ern state would en­act “a law ban­ning reli­gious con­ver­sions for the sake of mar­riage”.</p>
    <p>All these state gov­ern­ments are led by the Hindu na­tion­al­ist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). In As­sam, the BJP promised to mount a “strict fight against love ji­had”.</p>
    <p>The love ji­had de­bate fol­lows the mur­der of a 20-year-old Hindu woman in Haryana in late Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>CCTV footage ap­peared to show a man shoot­ing Ms Nikita To­mar in broad day­light as she re­sisted ab­duc­tion. The po­lice have ar­rested the al­leged shooter – a Mus­lim man who Ms To­mar’s fam­ily said had been stalk­ing her and at­tempted to kid­nap her ear­lier. The Haryana govern­ment claimed the in­ci­dent was a case of love ji­had.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, so­cial me­dia trolling by Hindu groups had forced a jew­ellery brand to with­draw its ad­ver­tise­ment fea­tur­ing a happy in­ter­re­li­gious fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The term love ji­had was first used around 2009 by some Hindu and Chris­tian groups in the south­ern states of Kar­nataka and Ker­ala to re­fer to a shad­owy con­spir­acy by Mus­lim men to de­ceive or co­erce women into con­vert­ing to Is­lam. It has since led to vig­i­lantes at­tack­ing or ha­rass­ing in­ter-faith cou­ples, es­pe­cially when the man is a Mus­lim.</p>
    <p>Yet, sev­eral of­fi­cial in­ves­ti­ga­tions have found no ev­i­dence of the ex­is­tence of love ji­had.</p>
    <p>In 2009, a probe by the Kar­nataka Crim­i­nal In­ves­ti­ga­tion Depart­ment into hun­dreds of in­ter-reli­gious mar­riages con­cluded: “There is no or­gan­ised at­tempt by any group of in­di­vid­u­als to en­tice girls/women be­long­ing to Hindu or Chris­tian re­li­gions to marry Mus­lim boys with the aim of con­vert­ing them to Is­lam.”</p>
    <p>In 2012, the Ker­ala po­lice said there was no ev­i­dence of the ex­is­tence of love ji­had in that state. In 2014, the Ut­tar Pradesh po­lice said there was no ev­i­dence of con­ver­sion in five of six love ji­had cases that it had in­ves­ti­gated. The state po­lice chief told Reuters at that time: “In most cases, we found that a Hindu girl and Mus­lim boy were in love and had mar­ried against their par­ents’ will.”</p>
    <p>In 2018, In­dia’s Supreme Court re­stored a mar­riage in­volv­ing a Hindu woman from Ker­ala who had con­verted to Is­lam. Ms Hadiya Ja­han’s fam­ily claimed that she was a vic­tim of love ji­had, de­spite her tes­ti­mony that she had con­verted will­ingly.</p>
    <p>A Supreme Court-or­dered probe by the Na­tional In­ves­ti­ga­tion Agency into 11 cases of in­ter-faith mar­riages in Ker­ala sub­se­quently found no ev­i­dence of forced con­ver­sion.</p>
    <p>This Fe­bru­ary, the BJP-led cen­tral govern­ment said in Par­lia­ment that no agen­cies had re­ported any case of love ji­had in In­dia.</p>
    <p>But many state gov­ern­ments con­tinue to in­ves­ti­gate in­ter-faith mar­riages. In Kan­pur, Ut­tar Pradesh, the po­lice re­cently set up a team to look into reports of love ji­had. Last month, the head of In­dia’s Na­tional Com­mis­sion for Women said that she had met the gov­er­nor of Ma­ha­rash­tra to dis­cuss a “rise in love ji­had cases”.</p>
    <p>There is no of­fi­cial data on the num­ber of in­ter-faith mar­riages in In­dia, but they are not very com­mon. The Na­tional Fam­ily Health Sur­vey 2016 found that only 2.6 per cent of mar­riages were be­tween peo­ple of dif­fer­ent re­li­gions (this did not in­clude mar­riages where one spouse changed their reli­gion).</p>
    <p>In­ter-faith cou­ples can get mar­ried un­der a Spe­cial Mar­riage Act with­out hav­ing to change their reli­gion. How­ever, the law re­quires the reg­is­trar to pub­licly post a no­tice about the in­tended mar­riage 30 days be­fore the wed­ding date. This some­times leads to in­ter­fer­ence by reluc­tant fam­i­lies or rightwing groups that op­pose in­ter­faith mar­riages.</p>
