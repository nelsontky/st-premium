    <p>Sin­ga­pore shares ex­tended their slide yes­ter­day as fears of a resur­gence of the coro­n­avirus and a Wall Street re­treat con­tin­ued to dampen in­vestor sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain is im­pos­ing new curbs on pubs, bars and restau­rants in a bid to tackle a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions, and Hong Kong has ex­tended so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures for an­other week on the back of fears of a “silent trans­mis­sion chain” in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Oanda se­nior mar­ket an­a­lyst Jef­frey Hal­ley said yes­ter­day: “One of the dan­gers to the global re­cov­ery would be the im­po­si­tion – again – of na­tional-level lock­downs in ma­jor de­vel­oped economies. That risk ap­pears to be ris­ing, un­for­tu­nately.</p>
    <p>“The tone of the week sug­gests that in­vestors are look­ing for ral­lies to sell, not buy into, with the bal­ance of prob­a­bil­i­ties im­ply­ing deeper cor­rec­tions to come.”</p>
    <p>There is also con­cern that tighter bank­ing re­stric­tions are in play af­ter new ev­i­dence that they have failed to stop sus­pi­cious trans­ac­tions in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>The higher lev­els of anx­i­ety among al­ready un­nerved in­vestors sent the bench­mark Straits Times In­dex (STI) slip­ping 22.42 points, or 0.9 per cent, to 2,463.29 on trade of 1.3 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties worth $1.31 bil­lion, with losers out­num­ber­ing gain­ers 236 to 201.</p>
    <p>The trio of len­ders were among the day’s big­gest losers. DBS fell 1.25 per cent to $19.74, United Over­seas Bank lost 0.99 per cent to $19.01, and OCBC Bank closed 0.71 per cent lower at $8.41.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion-re­lated stocks also saw de­clines. Sin­ga­pore Air­lines shed 1.75 per cent to $3.36 and gate­way ser­vices provider Sats ended the day at $2.76, down 2.13 per cent.</p>
    <p>Only five of the 30 STI con­stituent stocks ended the day in the green. Jar­dine Mathe­son Hold­ings was the top ad­vancer for the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive day, gain­ing 1.29 per cent to US$41.70.</p>
    <p>Gent­ing Sin­ga­pore was also among the win­ners, ris­ing 0.74 per cent to end the day at 68 cents, with 16.2 mil­lion shares traded.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts were among the big­gest con­stituent de­clin­ers.</p>
    <p>Cap­i­taLand Com­mer­cial Trust tum­bled 4.05 per cent to $1.66, and Cap­i­taLand Mall Trust closed 2.97 per cent lower at $1.96.</p>
    <p>Around the re­gion, stock markets ended the day mixed.</p>
    <p>Malaysian shares rose 0.42 per cent and Ja­pan’s Nikkei 225 inched up 0.18 per cent, but the Hang Seng dipped 0.98 per cent.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Kospi was the big­gest loser, div­ing 2.38 per cent, its sharpest de­cline in a month.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian mar­ket lost 0.7 per cent to leave it at a three-month low with en­ergy, fi­nan­cial and min­ing stocks tak­ing a hit.</p>
