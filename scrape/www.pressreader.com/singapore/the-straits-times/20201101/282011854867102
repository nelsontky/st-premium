    <p>When rental flat res­i­dents in Mei Ling Street in Queen­stown need help with money, food or filling up forms, they look for their “kam­pung head”, Mr Zulk­i­fli At­nawi.</p>
    <p>The re­tired cleaner lives in a tworoom rental flat with his four adult chil­dren, who gave him the ti­tle for his readi­ness to help oth­ers, such as by buy­ing food for the needy.</p>
    <p>When the Covid-19 pan­demic struck, Mr Zulk­i­fli, 60, and his chil­dren checked in on their neigh­bours, know­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod would be es­pe­cially hard on them.</p>
    <p>With the lit­tle money he had, and do­na­tions from his chil­dren and friends, he bought gro­ceries for fam­i­lies hit es­pe­cially hard by the cri­sis. He said: “Any­thing that they want or need, I tell them to come to me or to go to my daugh­ter.”</p>
    <p>Mr Zulk­i­fli’s daugh­ter Zu­layqha Zulk­i­fli, 26, is a so­cial work as­so­ciate who won The Straits Times Gen­er­a­tion Grit Award 2018.</p>
    <p>He has an­other daugh­ter, 25, who is a stu­dent care fa­cil­i­ta­tor, and a 24-year-old son who is a pas­try chef. His el­dest child, Mr Zul­haqem Zulk­i­fli, 28, is pur­su­ing a mas­ter’s de­gree at Ox­ford Uni­ver­sity in Bri­tain on a gov­ern­ment schol­ar­ship.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily’s care and con­cern for oth­ers also arose be­cause of the tough times they them­selves have had. When the chil­dren were younger, the fam­ily slept at the void deck for a time be­cause Mr Zulk­i­fli had lost his job as a tech­ni­cian and sold their fam­ily flat. He is now divorced.</p>
    <p>Not con­tent with giv­ing out gro­ceries to im­me­di­ate neigh­bours,</p>
    <p>Mr Zulk­i­fli’s chil­dren re­cruited vol­un­teers and started go­ing to rental flats in other parts of Queen­stown, like Stir­ling Road, and fur­ther afield in Kim Tian Road in Tiong Bahru, as part of an ini­tia­tive they call Project Hills.</p>
    <p>The group, made up of about 70 vol­un­teers, vis­its res­i­dents in th­ese es­tates with Mr Zulk­i­fli, dis­tribut­ing items and help­ing with home re­pairs. They also help peo­ple who are brought to their at­ten­tion, like a home­less fam­ily they found liv­ing in a ceme­tery.</p>
    <p>Mr Zul­haqem said the aim of Project Hills, which started in April, is to help needy peo­ple who may have slipped through the cracks. It also tries to link those who need help with the au­thor­i­ties and non-gov­ern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>For Mr Zul­haqem, the real re­ward is the news that the peo­ple he and his fam­ily have helped are step­ping for­ward them­selves to help oth­ers.</p>
    <p>He said: “I thought that was re­ally won­der­ful. With­out us re­al­is­ing it, a cul­ture has been es­tab­lished. When we help oth­ers, they go out on their own and help other neigh­bours.”</p>
    <p>Mr Zulk­i­fli waved away words of praise, say­ing his ef­forts are some­thing “small”. What mat­ters to him, he added, is that he has a chance to give back to so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>He said: “The good­ness of man is not mea­sured by his work, sta­tus or do­na­tions... It’s about how much you help oth­ers.”</p>
