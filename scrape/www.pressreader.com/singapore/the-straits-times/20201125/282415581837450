    <p>Tokyo Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike said yes­ter­day that the best­case sce­nario for next year’s post­poned Olympics is to have venues full of spec­ta­tors, as the or­gan­is­ers wres­tle with how to plan for the Games amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 in­fec­tions on the rise in many coun­tries around the world, Olympic or­gan­is­ers have not de­cided whether to al­low spec­ta­tors into venues next year and if so, how many. They said pre­vi­ously that they will not make a de­ci­sion on num­bers un­til the spring.</p>
    <p>Ms Koike, speak­ing at the For­eign Cor­re­spon­dents’ Club of Ja­pan, said the or­gan­is­ers were still hope­ful venues could be filled with fans dur­ing the July 23-Aug 8 Olympics.</p>
    <p>“The best-case sce­nario... would be when all ath­letes from all coun­tries come here in safety and with peace of mind and the Olympics can, as in pre­vi­ous years, be held with full spec­ta­tors present as well,” she said.</p>
    <p>Al­though Ja­pan has largely avoided the huge num­bers of Covid-19 in­fec­tions seen in other coun­tries, daily cases in Tokyo rose to records above 500 last week.</p>
    <p>The Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee has been dis­cussing ways to hold a “safe and se­cure” Games de­spite the re­cent spike.</p>
    <p>“Fol­low­ing Tokyo, Paris will host the (Sum­mer) Games in 2024 and then Los An­ge­les in 2028. We will cre­ate a new model that ben­e­fits the post-Covid world and I wish to pass this on to these two cities,” Ms Koike added.</p>
    <p>She warned that Tokyo was see­ing a rise in in­fec­tions among older res­i­dents, in­clud­ing cases where peo­ple had con­tracted the virus while eat­ing out and brought it home to el­derly rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>She also met Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga yes­ter­day to dis­cuss a do­mes­tic travel pro­mo­tion cam­paign in­tro­duced by the gov­ern­ment ear­lier this year to try to stim­u­late lo­cal economies hit by the near-com­plete ab­sence of for­eign tourism amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is pre­par­ing to pause the cam­paign in Osaka and Sap­poro fol­low­ing sharp rises in Covid-19 cases, the min­is­ter han­dling the coro­n­avirus re­sponse said.</p>
