    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • The woman who was fa­tally shot as Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s back­ers stormed the US Capi­tol on Wed­nes­day was Ms Ashli Bab­bitt, 35, a strong Trump sup­porter who had served in the United States Air Force, ac­cord­ing to me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>Vi­o­lence erupted in the nor­mally solemn home of the US leg­is­la­ture af­ter hun­dreds of pro­test­ers seek­ing to over­turn Mr Trump’s elec­tion loss swarmed the build­ing in Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>“The woman is Ashli Bab­bitt, a 14-year veteran, who served four tours with the US Air Force,” San Diego TV sta­tion KUSI re­ported, cit­ing the woman’s hus­band.</p>
    <p>“She was a strong sup­porter of Pres­i­dent Trump,” the re­port added, say­ing the woman was from the San Diego area in south­ern Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties said the woman died of a bul­let wound af­ter be­ing shot amid chaotic and vi­o­lent scenes inside the Capi­tol build­ing, where some se­cu­rity per­son­nel drew their guns as pro­test­ers ad­vanced.</p>
    <p>TV chan­nel Fox 5 re­ported that Ms Bab­bitt owned a busi­ness in San Diego with her hus­band, who did not go to Wash­ing­ton with her.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally don’t know why she de­cided to do this,” her mother-in-law re­port­edly told the sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Bab­bitt iden­ti­fied her­self as a veteran on her Twit­ter ac­count, and noted her love for the US.</p>
    <p>She had re­cently retweeted mes­sages in sup­port of Mr Trump and from those go­ing to Wash­ing­ton for Wed­nes­day’s rally.</p>
    <p>“Noth­ing will stop us... They can try and try and try, but the storm is here, and it is de­scend­ing upon DC in less than 24 hours... dark to light!” she wrote in a tweet on Tues­day.</p>
