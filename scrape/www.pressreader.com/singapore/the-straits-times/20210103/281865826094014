    <p>SEOUL • South Korea’s Min­istry of Health and Wel­fare has taken down a video it posted on so­cial me­dia en­cour­ag­ing danc­ing to beat the coro­n­avirus blues.</p>
    <p>The video, up­loaded on New Year’s Day and deleted yes­ter­day, drew crit­i­cism for be­ing out of touch, as most of the peo­ple in South Korea live in apart­ments.</p>
    <p>The min­istry apol­o­gised i n a state­ment on Face­book, say­ing the video – pro­mot­ing danc­ing as a way to cope with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – failed to con­sider “mul­ti­ple is­sues in­clud­ing noise be­tween floors”.</p>
    <p>“We apol­o­gise to the public. We have now made the video pri­vate,” said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>The video is no longer avail­able on Face­book or YouTube.</p>
    <p>The video shows five mem­bers of a fam­ily do­ing house­hold chores in an apart­ment be­fore be­ing joined by a TV re­porter and break­ing into a dance.</p>
    <p>Gath­er­ings of five peo­ple or more are banned in the cap­i­tal Seoul and its sur­round­ing area, and the same rule is set to take ef­fect na­tion­wide to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>Fam­i­lies liv­ing in the same house­hold are an ex­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>The dancers in the video jump in uni­son at one point as the song goes, “Go away, stress. Go away, coro­n­avirus”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to re­cent data from Sta­tis­tics Korea, nearly six in 10 dwellings through­out the coun­try were apart­ments as at last year.</p>
    <p>The back­lash comes as the govern­ment had to de­fend its late en­try in the vac­cine race in re­cent weeks as crit­ics ac­cused it of cel­e­brat­ing the coun­try’s han­dling of the pan­demic – also known as the K-Quar­an­tine Model – too soon.</p>
    <p>In July, the United States signed a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech to buy 100 mil­lion doses of their Covid-19 vac­cine. Ja­pan also struck a deal to buy their vac­cine for 60 mil­lion peo­ple the same month.</p>
    <p>Early last month, South Korea said it had “se­cured” Covid-19 vac­cines for 44 mil­lion peo­ple though it had signed an of­fi­cial con­tract only with As­traZeneca for 10 mil­lion peo­ple at that time.</p>
    <p>The an­nounce­ments of a deal with Pfizer, Janssen and Moderna came weeks later.</p>
