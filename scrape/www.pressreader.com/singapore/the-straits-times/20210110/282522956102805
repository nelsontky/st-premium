    <p>Run­ning a small de­sign firm means Ms Kel­ley Cheng has to do ev­ery­thing from manag­ing IT sys­tems to plan­ning social me­dia mar­ket­ing strat­egy, be­sides her own de­sign work.</p>
    <p>But the founder and cre­ative direc­tor of pub­lish­ing and de­sign con­sul­tancy The Press Room said she makes time to learn some­thing new ev­ery day, whether it is pick­ing up a new soft­ware or read­ing up on cur­rent af­fairs and pop cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“When you stop learn­ing as a leader, you can­not pro­vide the kind of lead­er­ship that is in­spir­ing to your team,” said Ms Cheng, who has four em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause if your team stays with you for five years and you are ex­actly the same, you do ev­ery­thing ex­actly the same, and you’re not shar­ing any new ideas, your team is go­ing to leave you.”</p>
    <p>On a per­sonal level, learn­ing also pro­vides in­spi­ra­tion for cre­ativ­ity, she added.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing the cu­rios­ity to learn about many dif­fer­ent things en­riches me as a de­signer and en­ables me to solve dif­fer­ent kinds of prob­lems in un­ex­pected ways.”</p>
    <p>Ms Cheng, 48, plans to use the $10,000 she re­ceived as one of last year’s Skill­sFu­ture Fel­low­ship awardees to take up cour­ses in pub­lish­ing lead­er­ship or film-mak­ing,</p>
    <p>which she hopes to do over­seas if the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion im­proves by this year.</p>
    <p>The vet­eran de­signer was a scriptwrit­er for doc­u­men­tary videos used in ex­hi­bi­tions de­signed by The Press Room, which</p>
    <p>she founded in 2009. She now wants to learn about film his­tory and im­prove her direct­ing skills.</p>
    <p>Pub­lish­ing, mean­while, is her first love – she started Singapore’s first in­de­pen­dent de­sign magazine ish in 1999 – but she wants to find</p>
    <p>new ways to pub­lish be­sides in print.</p>
    <p>Ms Cheng, who trained as an ar­chi­tect, be­lieves that in­di­vid­ual de­sign­ers and de­sign stu­dios in Singapore have to adapt to how tech­nol­ogy has con­nected the world as</p>
    <p>one econ­omy, which is why she is tak­ing the chance to broaden and deepen her skills.</p>
    <p>“Fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of de­sign­ers from Singapore will be com­pet­ing on a global arena, and to be able to charge a premium, one has to ei</p>
    <p>ther be very, very good at one thing, or you have to be a gen­er­al­ist... so that there is in­cen­tive for a client to come to you so that you can be a one-stop so­lu­tion for them,” she said.</p>
