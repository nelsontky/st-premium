    <p>IS­TAN­BUL • With sloppy restora­tion work and dam­aged or dis­fig­ured his­tor­i­cal mon­u­ments, ex­perts say a race for prof­its, ide­o­log­i­cal con­sid­er­a­tions and favouritis­m are leav­ing sen­si­tive up­keep of cul­tural her­itage by the way­side in Turkey.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, the Galata Tower – an em­blem­atic 14th-cen­tury Is­tan­bul land­mark – be­came the lat­est mon­u­ment at the heart of a dis­pute.</p>
    <p>Crit­i­cism from res­i­dents man­aged to nar­rowly block the de­mo­li­tion of one of its walls with a jack­ham­mer as part of a restora­tion, only af­ter a video of work­ers us­ing the power tool leaked on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Cul­ture Min­is­ter Nuri Er­soy tried to smooth things over, say­ing that the de­stroyed sec­tion was not an orig­i­nal part of the tower and an­nounc­ing “sanc­tions” against the con­struc­tion chiefs for us­ing the heavy-duty equip­ment.</p>
    <p>But in re­cent years, the list of poorly ren­o­vated mon­u­ments has grown, rang­ing from Ro­man mo­saics dam­aged by a botched restora­tion to con­crete piled up in the mid­dle of an an­cient am­phithe­atre to un­recog­nis­able mosques and citadels.</p>
    <p>For Mr Os­man Koker, founder of the gallery Birza­man­lar – a venue to dis­play the coun­try’s cul­tural di­ver­sity – a “harsh­ness” to­wards an­cient build­ings has al­ways ex­isted in Turkey, aimed es­pe­cially at eras­ing traces of non-Mus­lim mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>The pic­ture was much brighter in the early 2000s, when Mr Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan – now pres­i­dent – first be­came prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“Restor­ing build­ings with high sym­bolic value was pri­ori­tised back then, as part of ef­forts to join the Euro­pean Union,” Mr Koker said.</p>
    <p>In 2011, the highly suc­cess­ful restora­tion of the 10th-cen­tury Ar­me­nian church on Ak­damar is­land in Lake Van in east­ern Turkey re­ceived praise from many ex­perts.</p>
    <p>‘PROFIT ABOVE ALL’</p>
    <p>But Ankara’s es­trange­ment from the Euro­pean Union in re­cent years and a hard­line turn in Mr Er­do­gan’s poli­cies have trans­formed the sit­u­a­tion, said Mr Korhan Gu­mus, an ar­chi­tect spe­cial­is­ing in the preser­va­tion of cul­tural her­itage.</p>
    <p>“Ten­ders for ren­o­va­tions are awarded to favoured com­pa­nies which have es­tab­lished a monopoly. And the projects are above all aimed at mak­ing prof­its,” he lamented.</p>
    <p>“The ren­o­va­tions are man­aged en­tirely by con­struc­tion calls for ten­ders, with­out prior re­flec­tion on their his­tory.”</p>
    <p>Rather than pre­serv­ing “parts added by dif­fer­ent civil­i­sa­tions” over the cen­turies or mil­len­nia, project spec­i­fi­ca­tions of­ten call for “a resti­tu­tion of the orig­i­nal, which leads to grotesque re­sults,” he added.</p>
    <p>The cul­ture min­istry – in charge of main­tain­ing his­toric mon­u­ments – did not re­spond to the crit­i­cism when con­tacted.</p>
    <p>It was Mr Mahir Po­lat, cul­tural her­itage di­rec­tor for Is­tan­bul’s mu­nic­i­pal gov­ern­ment, who raised the alarm on the use of the jack­ham­mer dur­ing the restora­tion work at Galata Tower.</p>
    <p>The mu­nic­i­pal­ity, run by the main op­po­si­tion Repub­li­can Peo­ple’s Party since last year, lodged an im­me­di­ate com­plaint, only for the cul­ture min­istry to re­ject its ap­peal to in­spect the project.</p>
    <p>“When restora­tion is seen only as a con­struc­tion ac­tiv­ity and when we for­get that the mon­u­ment re­flects the cen­turies it has passed through, we miss the objective of preser­va­tion. We then have brand new re­con­struc­tions,” Mr Po­lat said.</p>
    <p>‘AR­BI­TRARY DE­CI­SIONS’</p>
    <p>“Ar­bi­trary de­ci­sions” some­times by­pass those in charge of cul­tural her­itage pro­tec­tion, Mr Po­lat com­plains.</p>
    <p>He said he dis­cov­ered in July that a his­toric foun­tain in Usku­dar on the Asian side of Is­tan­bul had van­ished overnight as part of a road widen­ing project.</p>
    <p>The dis­trict mu­nic­i­pal­ity led by Mr Er­do­gan’s rul­ing party, he said, had de­cided to “trans­port” the foun­tain with­out any au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“The his­tor­i­cal value at­trib­uted to a mon­u­ment only makes sense in the place it is lo­cated. You can­not trans­port it like any other ob­ject,” Mr Po­lat said. “We’ve heard noth­ing about this foun­tain since then”.</p>
    <p>Dr Tugba Tany­eri Erdemir, re­searcher at the Univer­sity of Pitts­burgh, ar­gued that Turkey’s gov­ern­ment favours “the dom­i­na­tion of cul­tural her­itage rather than its conservati­on,” high­light­ing re­cent de­ci­sions to con­vert Ha­gia Sophia cathe­dral and another church into mosques.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, Mr Er­do­gan or­dered the an­cient Ortho­dox Kariye church that be­came a mosque and then a pop­u­lar Is­tan­bul mu­seum to be turned back into a space for Mus­lim wor­ship.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion came just a month af­ter a sim­i­larly con­tro­ver­sial con­ver­sion to trans­form the Unesco World Her­itage-recog­nised Ha­gia Sophia into a mosque for the first time since 1934.</p>
    <p>With the era­sure of cul­tural her­itage, Mr Po­lat fears the memory of Is­tan­bul will dis­ap­pear.</p>
    <p>“The memory of a city is in­ti­mately linked to its liv­ing space. We failed to live to­gether with an­cient build­ings in the past,” he de­plored. “I hope we will re­alise the trea­sure we have in our hands.”</p>
