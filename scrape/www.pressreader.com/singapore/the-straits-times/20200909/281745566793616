    <p>As Sin­ga­pore con­tin­ues to re­open its econ­omy, more peo­ple are out and about, adding to the list of places vis­ited by those with Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Q How do I know which places were most vis­ited by Covid-19 cases in the past month?</p>
    <p>A The Min­istry of Health (MOH) pro­vides a daily list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 cases for at least half an hour, for the past 14 days. The tim­ings are also stated. The lo­ca­tions are up­dated on a rolling ba­sis and the full list is avail­able on the gov.sg web­site. Close con­tacts are also no­ti­fied. There is no need to avoid th­ese places as they would have been cleaned.</p>
    <p>Q How long is this list?</p>
    <p>A In the last five weeks, those in­fected with Covid-19 vis­ited more than 90 places, though it is not stated if the same per­son vis­ited mul­ti­ple lo­ca­tions. Shop­ping malls were the most vis­ited, in­clud­ing 12 in Or­chard Road and about 30 in es­tates such as Joo Koon and Pasir Ris.</p>
    <p>Mar­kets and hawker cen­tres also fea­ture on the list, such as Old Air­port Road Food Cen­tre and Shop­ping Mall and Chi­na­town Com­plex Food Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The fol­low­ing lo­ca­tions had the most num­ber of re­peated vis­its: Block 4A Jalan Batu Hawker Cen­tre (10), Lucky Plaza (6), VivoCity (5), Gey­lang Serai Market and Food Cen­tre (4), Wisma Atria (3), Bugis Junc­tion (3), HomeTeamNS Khatib (3) and Bukit Pan­jang Plaza (3).</p>
    <p>Q What should I do if I vis­ited th­ese places at the times stated on the list?</p>
    <p>A Mon­i­tor your health closely for two weeks from the date of your visit.</p>
    <p>If you have a fever, lose your sense of taste or smell, or de­velop symp­toms of acute res­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tion such as a cough, sore throat and runny nose, see a doc­tor promptly. In­form the doc­tor of your ex­po­sure his­tory.</p>
    <p>Q Should I avoid the places listed?</p>
    <p>A It is safe to visit th­ese lo­ca­tions. Re­search shows that the risk of in­fec­tion through fomites is low, said Pro­fes­sor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore. Fomites are ob­jects that are likely to carry the virus, like fur­ni­ture.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo added that the main mode of trans­mis­sion is still through droplets as a re­sult of hu­man-to-hu­man in­ter­ac­tions in close prox­im­ity.</p>
    <p>All the places on the MOH list have to be thor­oughly cleaned and the work done un­der the su­per­vi­sion of the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency’s (NEA) of­fi­cers. NEA has guide­lines on how the clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion should be done. To date, NEA of­fi­cers have at­tended to more than 3,500 premises, of which the ma­jor­ity are res­i­dences of con­firmed cases.</p>
    <p>Q How ex­ten­sively are the premises cleaned?</p>
    <p>A NEA’s guide­lines com­prise 22 rec­om­mended steps. Th­ese in­clude the ap­pro­pri­ate tem­per­a­ture to wash linen and in­struc­tions on how to dis­pose of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment worn by the clean­ers.</p>
    <p>If premise own­ers and oper­a­tors are not able to carry out the clean­ing them­selves, NEA has a list of com­pa­nies that they can en­gage.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for one such com­pany, Clean Lab, said its clean­ing team would ar­rive about one to two hours af­ter it has been en­gaged for a clean­ing job. Clean Lab de­ploys a crew of be­tween three and five trained spe­cial­ists to each lo­ca­tion. The spe­cial­ists re­spond only to Covid-19 de­con­tam­i­na­tion re­quests.</p>
    <p>Other com­pa­nies such as Aard­wolf Pestkare and Ex­cel­tec Prop­erty Man­age­ment said they use ac­tive in­gre­di­ents rec­om­mended by NEA in the dis­in­fec­tant so­lu­tions for wip­ing down com­monly touched sur­faces and mist­ing hard-to-reach spots.</p>
    <p>Be­sides clean­ing, busi­nesses such as Muji and Prive restau­rant also checked on the health of their staff af­ter find­ing out that their premises had been vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Prive said it “quar­an­tined all rel­e­vant staff” upon find­ing out that its out­let at Whee­lock Place was af­fected.</p>
    <p>Q Is clean­ing still needed if restau­rant, shop and mall oper­a­tors find out that their premises have been vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients only sev­eral days af­ter the visit?</p>
    <p>A Given that lo­ca­tions are up­dated on a rolling ba­sis, and some time is needed for epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions and con­tact trac­ing to be done be­fore new places are added to MOH’s list, some own­ers of premises may find out they were vis­ited by pa­tients up to 14 days af­ter the day of the visit. For in­stance, eight vis­its to var­i­ous lo­ca­tions on Aug 24 were added 14 days af­ter they were vis­ited.</p>
    <p>Prof Teo said: “The Sars-CoV-2 virus can sur­vive on sur­faces for days, and stud­ies have even shown a vi­able life­time of up to three weeks in chilled en­vi­ron­ments of around 4 deg C.</p>
    <p>“So, it cer­tainly is still good prac­tice to per­form the dis­in­fec­tion pro­to­cols.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Other places that were vis&#xAD;ited sev&#xAD;eral times by pa&#xAD;tients while they were in&#xAD;fec&#xAD;tious are (from above) Lucky Plaza, VivoCity and Gey&#xAD;lang Serai Market and Food Cen&#xAD;tre. All of th&#xAD;ese places would have been thor&#xAD;oughly cleaned, with the work done un&#xAD;der the su&#xAD;per&#xAD;vi&#xAD;sion of the Na&#xAD;tional En&#xAD;vi&#xAD;ron&#xAD;ment Agency&#x2019;s of&#xAD;fi&#xAD;cers.</p>
