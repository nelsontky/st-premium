    <p>When the world’s largest trade pact – the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) – was signed about a fort­night ago, peo­ple were left with dif­fer­ent im­pres­sions of its sig­nif­i­cance, depend­ing on which me­dia out­let they read.</p>
    <p>A New York Times re­port was head­lined “China-led trade pact is signed, in chal­lenge to US”, while China na­tion­al­ist tabloid Global Times ran an opin­ion piece ti­tled “RCEP will end US hege­mony in West Pa­cific”.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong de­scribed it as a ma­jor step for­ward for the world, “at a time when mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism is los­ing ground, and global growth is slow­ing”, in re­marks car­ried in The Straits Times and Fi­nan­cial Times.</p>
    <p>Some re­ports and an­a­lysts have de­scribed the eight-year ne­go­ti­a­tion process as driven or led by China, which ob­servers and diplo­mats in­ter­viewed say is in­ac­cu­rate.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran diplo­mat Barry Desker called such me­dia cov­er­age mis­lead­ing. “Asean’s lead­er­ship en­abled the con­clu­sion of the agree­ment. With­out Asean, a broad agree­ment of this na­ture would not have been con­cluded among the non-Asean mem­bers. The sign­ing at the Asean Sum­mit demon­strates Asean’s con­ven­ing power.”</p>
    <p>Also, RCEP is the first such pact jointly con­cluded by China, Ja­pan and South Korea at the re­gional level, added Mr Desker, a dis­tin­guished fel­low at the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies (RSIS). “Strate­gic ri­valry and his­tor­i­cal an­i­mosi­ties have pre­vented these East Asian states from em­bark­ing on such ne­go­ti­a­tions... With RCEP, the stage is now set to be­gin ne­go­ti­a­tions for a tri­lat­eral East Asian agree­ment,” he said.</p>
    <p>Am­bas­sador-at-Large Ong Keng Yong, RSIS ex­ec­u­tive deputy chair­man and a for­mer Asean sec­re­tarygen­eral, said the RCEP sign­ing is im­por­tant as it took place dur­ing the pan­demic, when the manufactur­ing sec­tor in Asean is strug­gling. “Any way of low­er­ing trans­ac­tion cost in the re­gion will lift in­vestors’ con­fi­dence in Asean.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Si­mon Tay, chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs, noted that it was Asean that crafted a frame­work of prin­ci­ples to guide the RCEP process for­ward with its other part­ners. “This prior prepa­ra­tion by Asean and the long and chal­leng­ing path shows that RCEP was never the case of China or any sin­gle coun­try dic­tat­ing terms.”</p>
    <p>Ob­servers, how­ever, ac­knowl­edge the pos­si­ble per­cep­tion that China could gain sig­nif­i­cantly as it is the largest econ­omy in the pact.</p>
    <p>Dr Mal­colm Cook, a vis­it­ing se­nior fel­low at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak In­sti­tute, said RCEP is a big strate­gic win for the Chi­nese as it sup­ports Bei­jing’s rhetoric that China is in favour of greater eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>It is also a big win strate­gi­cally for Asean, which de­liv­ered on its rhetoric of re­gional cen­tral­ity and sup­port for greater eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Desker, how­ever, said it is likely RCEP mem­bers will see the pact as a means of in­flu­enc­ing and shap­ing Chi­nese trade pol­icy.</p>
