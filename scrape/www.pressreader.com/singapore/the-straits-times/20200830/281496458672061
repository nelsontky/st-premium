    <p>Ac­tivist lawyer Arnon Nampa sang a med­ley of folk songs at a Bangkok po­lice sta­tion on Friday.</p>
    <p>Hold­ing a cord­less mi­cro­phone con­nected to a loud­speaker, he ser­e­naded a row of mask-wear­ing po­lice­men who were keep­ing pro­test­ers away from 15 ac­tivists, who were inside the sta­tion hearing charges over their anti-govern­ment protests.</p>
    <p>The crowd out­side kept vigil un­til those charged were re­leased.</p>
    <p>A week be­fore, Bangkok’s sky­train sta­tions went mys­te­ri­ously silent at 6pm, when all commuters usu­ally stand at at­ten­tion for the na­tional an­them. That was the day a tweet sur­faced ask­ing commuters to flash a three-fin­ger salute dur­ing the an­them – a trade­mark of the na­tion­wide youth-driven protests.</p>
    <p>Alarmed at the wave of stu­dents do­ing this salute dur­ing morn­ing assemblies, the di­rec­tor of a pri­vate school in Bangkok banned po­lit­i­cal ex­pres­sion on cam­pus. The girls turned up any­way with school­bags knot­ted with white rib­bons – an­other sym­bol of the move­ment.</p>
    <p>The de­fi­ance has been con­ta­gious. One year af­ter an elec­tion re-in­stalled lead­ers of the 2014 mil­i­tary coup, Thai­land is see­ing a swell of protests from peo­ple de­mand­ing the democ­racy they feel they have been robbed of.</p>
    <p>At least 60 protests have sprung up since May, af­ter re­stric­tions to curb the coro­n­avirus out­break were eased, ac­cord­ing to mon­i­tor­ing web­site Mob Data Thai­land. They were held mostly in Bangkok but also as far as Chi­ang Mai, Pat­tani, Khon Kaen and Kan­chanaburi prov­inces.</p>
    <p>Loosely struc­tured, mo­bilised swiftly with trending hash­tags and of­ten live-streamed, the protests have latched on to pub­lic dis­il­lu­sion about an econ­omy pro­jected to shrink by 8.1 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers have mus­tered both flash mobs and hours-long ex­trav­a­gan­zas, but stayed away from the pro­tracted sit-ins that paral­ysed Bangkok in Thai­land’s tur­bu­lent past. Along the way, groups al­lied with the move­ment have in­jected their causes in its slip­stream: labour and gay rights, school re­form and, more con­tentiously, monar­chy re­form.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-ocha warned last Wednes­day that the na­tion would be “en­gulfed in flames” if the stu­dents went too far.</p>
    <p>But the govern­ment’s spokesman Anucha Bu­ra­pachaisri said it is not dis­miss­ing their de­mands. “We are think­ing of do­ing some­thing but we want to do it the proper way. Be­cause there are so many groups, we have to iden­tify what each is ask­ing for,” he told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>Ask Tattep Ruangprapa­ikitseree, the 23-year-old sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the main protest or­gan­is­ing group, Free Peo­ple, and he would say it is all quite sim­ple.</p>
    <p>Free Peo­ple de­mands that the govern­ment stop ha­rass­ing its crit­ics, amend the mil­i­tary-backed Con­sti­tu­tion and dissolve the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives for fresh elec­tions. It also has what it calls a “dream” of a democ­racy with the monarch un­der the Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>The care­fully worded statement has put the spot­light on King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn, who, since as­cend­ing the throne in 2016, has taken per­sonal con­trol of the multi­bil­lion-dol­lar as­sets of the Crown Prop­erty Bureau and two army units.</p>
    <p>Groups al­lied with Free Peo­ple sup­port its three ba­sic de­mands, said the baby-faced Tattep.</p>
    <p>“You can de­mand many things, but what­ever prob­lems you have – be they re­lated to the en­vi­ron­ment, the mil­i­tary or the monar­chy – they can only be solved by first un­lock­ing the Con­sti­tu­tion.”</p>
    <p>Tattep’s fa­ther, wid­owed six years ago, works as a Grab de­liv­ery rider. Tattep sup­ported him­self, while read­ing pol­i­tics at Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity, by giv­ing tu­ition.</p>
    <p>“I ini­tially wanted to live the mid­dle-class dream, find a good job and have a good life,” he said, in be­tween sips of a choco­late frappe at a Bangkok cafe.</p>
    <p>“But my part­ner said we can hardly achieve this dream un­der the cur­rent power struc­ture,” he added, shift­ing closer to his part­ner and fel­low protest or­gan­iser Panu­mas Sing­prom in the next chair.</p>
    <p>Gen­er­a­tion Z, hav­ing come of age un­der a roy­al­ist mil­i­tary govern­ment that leaned on the coun­try’s oligopolis­tic con­glom­er­ates, blame their bleak fu­ture on the state of Thai pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>They are “frus­trated about the long­stand­ing po­lit­i­cal and eco­nomic sup­pres­sion”, said Tattep. “They can­not see what their fu­ture will be like. That’s why they have come out.”</p>
    <p>Amid the pan­demic-in­duced aus­ter­ity, which forced the govern­ment to cut each agency’s bud­get by 10 per cent, even once-taboo sub­jects have gained trac­tion.</p>
    <p>On Aug 10, be­fore a crowd of thou­sands at Tham­masat Univer­sity in Pathum Thani prov­ince, 22-yearold so­ci­ol­ogy and an­thro­pol­ogy stu­dent Panusaya Sithi­ji­rawat­tanakul read out a list of 10 de­mands for monar­chy re­form. It in­cluded re­duc­ing the bud­get al­lo­cated to the palace ac­cord­ing to eco­nomic con­di­tions and ceas­ing pub­lic­ity that praised the monar­chy ex­ces­sively.</p>
    <p>The up­roar it caused among roy­al­ists forced the deputy rec­tor of Tham­masat Univer­sity to apol­o­gise. But it proved im­pos­si­ble to put the ge­nie back in the bot­tle.</p>
    <p>A week or so later, 21-year-old Ms Ju­tatip Sirikhan, pres­i­dent of the Stu­dent Union of Thai­land, went on stage at a labour rights event in Pathum Thani to try to sug­gest that the bud­get for the palace should be redi­rected to so­cial se­cu­rity. Guards hired by the protest or­gan­is­ers them­selves tried to bun­dle her off stage.</p>
    <p>Ms Ju­tatip is un­apolo­getic. “I spoke about the re­al­ity, us­ing pub­lic in­for­ma­tion,” said the Tham­masat Univer­sity stu­dent. “So­cial sen­ti­ments have changed. Peo­ple can now speak the truth.”</p>
    <p>Not every­body agrees. Out­go­ing army chief Api­rat Kong­som­pong has al­luded to the pro­test­ers as “na­tion haters”.</p>
    <p>Anucha says leg­is­la­tors are draft­ing amend­ments to the Con­sti­tu­tion that will be for­warded to the Speaker this com­ing week. But he de­clined to com­ment when asked about monar­chy re­form, say­ing only: “We have to be very care­ful about how to pro­ceed.”</p>
    <p>Thai­land has a lese ma­jeste law which pun­ishes those who in­sult or de­fame the monar­chy with up to 15 years in jail. While this has not been used against the pro­test­ers yet, sev­eral ac­tivists, in­clud­ing Arnon, Tattep and pop­u­lar un­der­ground rap­per Dechathorn Bam­rung­muang, have been charged with sedi­tion and other of­fences.</p>
    <p>Anti-monar­chy ac­tivists in re­cent years have met grim­mer fates. Last year, the bod­ies of two such ex­iles washed up on the banks of the Mekong River. They had been dis­em­bow­elled and stuffed with con­crete.</p>
    <p>Asked about the pos­si­ble dan­gers ahead, Ms Panusaya, who is leader of a group called United Front of Tham­masat and Demon­stra­tion, said: “I’m pre­pared. I’ve told my col­leagues what to do if I die, and how they can con­tact my family.”</p>
    <p>Crit­ics al­lege that the protests are backed by a third party. Stu­dents say they are funded by huge sales of T-shirts and pub­lic do­na­tions.</p>
    <p>Free Peo­ple will dis­band when Thai­land achieves true democ­racy, says Tattep. But the jour­ney will likely be long.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, ac­tivists have been brief­ing for­eign diplo­mats.</p>
    <p>A vi­ral anti-dic­ta­tor­ship rap re­leased in 2018 called Pra­thet Ku Mee, roughly trans­lat­ing to “My coun­try’s got”, has be­come an an­them of sorts for the dis­af­fected. Ac­cord­ing to Dechathorn, a new rap will soon be in­tro­duced.</p>
    <p>Ms Panusaya says she will not leave pol­i­tics: “I have been talk­ing to my friends, and we may start a po­lit­i­cal party. Re­gard­less of whether we are inside the po­lit­i­cal sys­tem or out­side it, we will fight.”</p>
    <p>Her group will hold an­other rally at the Bangkok cam­pus of Tham­masat Univer­sity on Sept 19, while a high school group called Bad Stu­dent which shared the stage at a re­cent Free Peo­ple protest will hold a demon­stra­tion at the Min­istry of Education in Bangkok on Sat­ur­day.</p>
    <p>Its hash­tag is #IKnowIAmBa­d</p>
    <p>DIS­TANT I live dream, and But ini­tially my the have DREAM part­ner find mid­dle-class wanted a good a good said life. to job we can this hardly dream achieve un­der the cur­rent power struc­ture. ’’ TATTEP RUANGPRAPA­IKITSEREE, 23, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the main protest or­gan­is­ing group, Free Peo­ple. His part­ner is fel­low protest or­gan­iser Panu­mas</p>
    <p>Sing­prom.</p>

MS PANUSAYA SITHI­JI­RAWAT­TANAKUL, a 22-year-old so­ci­ol­ogy and an­thro­pol­ogy stu­dent, who read out a list of 10 de­mands for monar­chy re­form be­fore a crowd of thou­sands at Tham­masat Univer­sity in Pathum Thani prov­ince.</p>
