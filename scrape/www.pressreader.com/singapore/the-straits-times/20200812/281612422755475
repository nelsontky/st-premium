    <p>Sin­ga­pore will not re­turn to a preCovid-19 world, and must chart a new path by build­ing a new econ­omy now, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day where it was an­nounced that Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy con­tracted 6.7 per cent in the first half of this year and is ex­pected to shrink by be­tween 5 per cent and 7 per cent this year, Mr Chan said the “painful truth” is that the coun­try will not re­turn to a pre</p>
    <p>Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>He said recurring waves of in­fec­tion and dis­rup­tion mean that re­cov­ery will take time and will be un­even across sec­tors. “Some sec­tors will pro­gres­sively re­cover, while oth­ers will be per­ma­nently changed.”</p>
    <p>He also cau­tioned that the cur­rent cri­sis is un­like the 1998 Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis or 2009 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis where “if we hun­ker down, things will im­prove in a few months”.</p>
    <p>“If we wait it out, we will likely be in worse shape than we are now,” he said, adding that the Re­pub­lic must start now to build a new econ­omy and cre­ate more job op­por­tu­ni­ties for peo­ple. “We can­not wait for Covid-19 to blow over.”</p>
    <p>World has changed</p>
    <p>There are four ways in which the world has changed ir­re­vo­ca­bly, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>First, the geopo­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment which al­lowed Sin­ga­pore to thrive in the last 50 years has changed.</p>
    <p>Com­pe­ti­tion and ten­sion be­tween the ma­jor pow­ers now per­me­ate not just politics, but also trade, tech­nol­ogy and se­cu­rity, he said.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing the ex­am­ple of mes­sag­ing plat­forms, he said that when Sin­ga­pore­ans do business in China, they com­mu­ni­cate with their Chi­nese coun­ter­parts via WeChat and can­not ac­cess What­sApp. The con­verse could be true in the United States in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>He said: “We must avoid be­ing caught be­tween the con­flicts of the ma­jor pow­ers, or be stranded in a frag­ment­ing world of trade re­la­tions and tech­no­log­i­cal stan­dards.”</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, global com­pa­nies are re­or­gan­is­ing their pro­duc­tion and sup­ply chains, re­view­ing the need for re­gional head­quar­ters and where their fac­to­ries are sited. Many are shift­ing from a fo­cus on ef­fi­ciency or “just in time” to re­silience or “just in case”.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said that for some man­u­fac­tur­ers, this means a “China plus one” strat­egy with an ac­tive fo­cus on Asean.</p>
    <p>This means that while some new in­vest­ments may come Sin­ga­pore’s way, ex­ist­ing ones may also move to other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>“If we do not adapt quickly, we will be by­passed,” cau­tioned Mr Chan, point­ing out that the coun­try must en­hance its crit­i­cal ad­van­tages, such as in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty pro­tec­tion and le­gal cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>The chang­ing na­ture of tax – from tax­ing dig­i­tal ac­tiv­ity to pres­sur­ing com­pa­nies to do more in their home coun­tries – could also af­fect com­pa­nies’ de­ci­sions to in­vest in Sin­ga­pore, he added.</p>
    <p>Third, he said, jobs have changed, and re­mote work means those in other coun­tries can do Sin­ga­pore­ans’ jobs from their homes.</p>
    <p>This will af­fect many PMETs or pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians, whose jobs can ei­ther be done vir­tu­ally, or through au­to­ma­tion and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>Fourth, the shrink­ing eco­nomic pie will pro­duce more so­cial fric­tion – be­tween those who have more and those with less; and be­tween for­eign­ers and lo­cals, or even be­tween cit­i­zens and per­ma­nent res­i­dents, he said.</p>
    <p>Even as there are calls for greater pro­tec­tion and re­dis­tri­bu­tion of in­come, he urged Sin­ga­pore­ans not to iso­late them­selves from the world.</p>
    <p>“With­out the world as our hin­ter­land and mar­ket, we will re­duce Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic ma­noeu­vring space, and limit rather than ex­pand op­por­tu­ni­ties for our peo­ple,” he said.</p>
    <p>In­stead, he added, those af­fected by job and business losses should be bet­ter taken care of in a sus­tain</p>
    <p>able way that is “not di­vi­sive, af­firms the dig­nity of work and strength­ens our so­cial fab­ric”.</p>
    <p>Three prin­ci­ples for Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore must hold on to three prin­ci­ples as it charts this new path, he said.</p>
    <p>First, it will be open for business in a safe and sus­tain­able way.</p>
    <p>It will iso­late im­pacted Covid-19 clus­ters quickly and tightly and learn from the ex­pe­ri­ence of oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The spec­trum of ac­tiv­i­ties will be man­aged pro­por­tion­ately, with tighter mea­sures for high­er­risk ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Above all, if we each ex­er­cise so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity, we can per­mit more ac­tiv­i­ties with less risk,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the Gov­ern­ment will help busi­nesses and work­ers ad­just to the new world.</p>
    <p>Firms with good op­por­tu­ni­ties in ar­eas such as bio­pharma, sup­ply chains and pre­ci­sion en­gi­neer­ing will be given a boost. There will be a con­ducive and at­trac­tive en­vi­ron­ment for new busi­nesses to start up and plant their in­vest­ments here for the long term, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the value-add cap­tured, such ef­forts are about build­ing re­silient and sus­tain­able sys­tems for the fu­ture, he said.</p>
    <p>Firms that have suf­fered a drop in de­mand but will even­tu­ally re­cover, will get help to pre­serve their core ca­pa­bil­i­ties so as to emerge stronger.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing sup­port such as the Jobs Sup­port Scheme of wage sub­si­dies and rental re­lief schemes, he said, should be redi­rected to­wards help­ing firms gen­er­ate fresh rev­enue and be­come more cost-ef­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>For in­dus­tries that are per­ma­nently changed – such as tourism and en­ter­tain­ment – there will be help for them to rein­vent them­selves, and pivot into new mar­kets and prod­ucts, said Mr Chan.</p>
    <p>“We know that these are tough de­ci­sions to make. But the faster we adapt and change, the faster our re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>Third, the Gov­ern­ment will es­tab­lish “the right macro con­di­tions”, in­clud­ing strength­en­ing Sin­ga­pore’s links to the global mar­kets for sup­plies, tech­nol­ogy and tal­ent.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic’s avi­a­tion and port hub sta­tus can never be taken for granted, and more will be re­vealed on this in the com­ing weeks, Mr Chan said.</p>
    <p>He added that the dig­i­tal free trade agree­ments that Sin­ga­pore has inked will open more mar­kets for its busi­nesses, while pre­serv­ing ex­ist­ing ac­cess to con­ven­tional mar­kets.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment will also train Sin­ga­pore­ans for the jobs of to­mor­row and strengthen job match­ing ef­forts.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan gave the as­sur­ance that de­spite the cri­sis of a gen­er­a­tion, Sin­ga­pore is start­ing from a much stronger po­si­tion than the Pioneer and Merdeka gen­er­a­tions – given its rep­u­ta­tion for con­nec­tiv­ity, strong tri­par­tite re­la­tion­ships and the rule of law, and a highly skilled and ed­u­cated work­force.</p>
    <p>He promised that de­spite the chal­lenges, the Gov­ern­ment’s com­mit­ment to ev­ery Sin­ga­porean re­mains the same.</p>
    <p>“We will do our ut­most to pre­pare our peo­ple for the chal­lenges ahead, for us not only to sur­vive, but to thrive in the new en­vi­ron­ment, and we will not wait for the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion to blow over,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We will start now, re­fresh­ing our econ­omy and build­ing those new op­por­tu­ni­ties for our peo­ple and the next gen­er­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>PRE­PAR­ING TO THRIVE</p>
    <p>We will do our ut­most to pre­pare our peo­ple for the chal­lenges ahead, for us not only to sur­vive, but to thrive in the new en­vi­ron­ment, and we will not wait for the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion to blow over. We will start now, re­fresh­ing our econ­omy and build­ing those new op­por­tu­ni­ties for our peo­ple and the next gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>TRADE AND IN­DUS­TRY MIN­IS­TER CHAN CHUN SING</p>
    <p>CALL TO JOB SEEK­ERS</p>
    <p>We still hope that job seek­ers may con­sider giv­ing these op­por­tu­ni­ties a try be­cause they do al­low you to gain rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ence, and hope­fully when the com­pany is in a po­si­tion to hire into per­ma­nent po­si­tions, you will be in a bet­ter place to ac­cess these op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>MAN­POWER MIN­IS­TER JOSEPHINE TEO, not­ing there are still pock­ets of hir­ing, as well as trainee­ships and at­tach­ments, avail­able.</p>
