    <p>Asean mem­bers have agreed to re­frain from im­ple­ment­ing trade-re­stric­tive mea­sures on some essen­tial goods such as medicines and med­i­cal sup­plies amid the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the eco­nomic min­is­ters from the 10 mem­ber states, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing, signed a mem­o­ran­dum of un­der­stand­ing (MOU) on this at a meet­ing ahead of to­mor­row’s sum­mit of Asean lead­ers.</p>
    <p>The 19th Asean Eco­nomic Com­mu­nity (AEC) coun­cil meet­ing was held vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>“We had a good start to the meet­ings,” Mr Chan said in a Face­book post. The agree­ment, he added, “rep­re­sents our shared com­mit­ment to fa­cil­i­tate trade flows within the re­gion for much-needed essen­tial goods in our ef­forts to com­bat the Covid-19 pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan added that the MOU on the Im­ple­men­ta­tion of Non-Tar­iff Mea­sures on Essen­tial Goods was part of Asean’s ac­tion plan to strengthen eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion and sup­ply-chain con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) said the min­is­ters also dis­cussed and en­dorsed the Asean Com­pre­hen­sive Re­cov­ery Frame­work (ACRF) to reaf­firm their com­mit­ment to work to­gether to mit­i­gate the ad­verse im­pacts of the pan­demic on the re­gion, as coun­tries grad­u­ally re­open their economies.</p>
    <p>The ACRF will be sub­mit­ted to Asean lead­ers for adop­tion at the sum­mit, which will be chaired by Viet­nam. The AEC Coun­cil Re­port was also en­dorsed by the min­is­ters for sub­mis­sion to the lead­ers, said MTI.</p>
    <p>The re­port high­lights Asean’s ef­forts to im­prove trade con­nec­tiv­ity and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion in the re­gion, in­clud­ing the im­ple­men­ta­tion of the Asean-wide Self-Cer­ti­fi­ca­tion Scheme to fa­cil­i­tate trade in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Other ef­forts high­lighted in the re­port in­clude the in­au­gu­ral Asean On­line Sale Day, the Asean Cus­toms Tran­sit Sys­tem and the adop­tion of the Dec­la­ra­tion on Dig­i­tal Tourism this year.</p>
    <p>The min­is­ters also dis­cussed the pre­lim­i­nary re­port of the midterm re­view of the AEC Blue­print 2025, said MTI.</p>
    <p>Asean’s ef­forts to deepen con­nec­tiv­ity and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion will gen­er­ate prac­ti­cal ben­e­fits for busi­nesses dur­ing this dif­fi­cult pe­riod, Mr Chan was quoted as say­ing in the MTI state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The suc­cess­ful launch of these ini­tia­tives this year also re­flect Asean’s de­ter­mi­na­tion to fa­cil­i­tate trade and strengthen sup­ply-chain con­nec­tiv­ity within the re­gion,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The de­vel­op­ment of the ACRF rep­re­sents our col­lec­tive ef­forts to en­able the Asean economies to max­imise the ben­e­fits of greater eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion to spur re­cov­ery and longer-term re­silience.”</p>
    <p>To­day, Mr Chan will at­tend the Prepara­tory Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) Min­is­te­rial Meet­ing, and on Sun­day, the 4th RCEP Sum­mit. The 15-coun­try RCEP, the world’s largest free trade agree­ment, is ex­pected to be signed on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>This week, Asean lead­ers are ex­pected to dis­cuss is­sues re­lated to build­ing in­tra-bloc co­op­er­a­tion, ex­pand­ing and deep­en­ing re­la­tions be­tween Asean and its part­ners, re­gional and in­ter­na­tional is­sues, as well as con­trol­ling the pan­demic and its af­ter­math.</p>
    <p>The 37th Asean Sum­mit will take place vir­tu­ally from to­mor­row till Sun­day in Hanoi.</p>
