    <p>LON­DON • Ac­tress Ni­cole Kid­man (right) said on Tues­day that ev­ery­one had a role to play in end­ing vi­o­lence against women and girls that has surged in lock­downs dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Os­car-win­ning ac­tress, who is a United Na­tions (UN) Women’s Good­will Am­bas­sador, said her role in tele­vi­sion se­ries Big Lit­tle Lies (2017 to 2019) had strength­ened her stance on vi­o­lence against women, call­ing lock­down spikes in abuse a “shadow pan­demic”.</p>
    <p>Kid­man, 53, said play­ing lawyer and do­mes­tic abuse sur­vivor Ce­leste on the hit HBO se­ries had af­fected her per­son­ally.</p>
    <p>“I felt ex­posed, vul­ner­a­ble and deeply hu­mil­i­ated as I told her story – even though play­ing that char­ac­ter is noth­ing com­pared with what women in abu­sive re­la­tion­ships face,” Kid­man said in an opin­ion col­umn in The Guardian news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian ac­tress said the sto­ries of sur­vivors she had met dur­ing her UN work pushed her to lend her voice to those with­out a plat­form.</p>
    <p>From Latin Amer­ica to Europe, coun­tries around the world have re­ported spikes in do­mes­tic vi­o­lence against women dur­ing pan­demic-re­lated lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Last year, 243 mil­lion women and girls ex­pe­ri­enced sex­ual or phys­i­cal vi­o­lence from their part­ners, Dr Phumzile Mlam­boNgcuka, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of UN Women, said last month.</p>
    <p>This year, re­ports of in­creased do­mes­tic vi­o­lence, cy­ber bul­ly­ing, child mar­riages, sex­ual ha­rass­ment and sex­ual vi­o­lence have flooded in, she added.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing lock­downs ear­lier this year, Mex­ico and Colom­bia saw spikes of more than 50 per cent in re­ports of vi­o­lence against women and do­mes­tic abuse.</p>
    <p>Across Europe – from Bul­garia to Bri­tain – coun­tries in April re­ported up to a 60 per cent in­crease in emer­gency calls from women sub­jected to vi­o­lence by their part­ners.</p>
    <p>In her col­umn, Kid­man linked to a UN Pop­u­la­tion Fund note in April that said ev­ery three months of lock­down could lead to 15 mil­lion cases of gen­der-based vi­o­lence. She said it was im­por­tant to lis­ten to sur­vivors, to have con­ver­sa­tions with chil­dren about gen­der and con­sent, and to use so­cial me­dia and com­mu­nity spa­ces to raise aware­ness.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­one has a role to play and power to con­trib­ute to end­ing vi­o­lence against women and girls, even dur­ing this pan­demic,” she wrote. “Vi­o­lence against women and girls was al­ready wide­spread be­fore the pan­demic. Whether it will out­live it or not, it’s on us all.”</p>
