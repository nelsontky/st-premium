    <p>1 HAKKA FAM­ILY (1939, right)</p>
    <p>This large-scale work, mea­sur­ing 162cm by 130cm, rep­re­sents an early break­through for the young Chen as a painter.</p>
    <p>She was very pleased with the piece, which be­came the star at­trac­tion of sub­se­quent solo shows.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the sig­nif­i­cant size, the topic of mother and child was some­thing which greatly en­gaged her in her pre-war ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Its pyra­mi­dal com­po­si­tion, with a nurs­ing mother, echoes clas­sic Euro­pean works, es­pe­cially Re­nais­sance-era Madonna-and-child com­po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>But the sub­ject mat­ter is very much Chi­nese, with the hat, bam­boo yoke, wooden clogs and rice bowl in­stantly set­ting the scene in Asia.</p>
    <p>2 CE­RAMIC DISHES (above)</p>
    <p>While she is bet­ter known for her paint­ings to­day, Chen spent some time in 1950 work­ing in a ce­ramic stu­dio.</p>
    <p>She took part in two group ex­hi­bi­tions and went on to de­sign crock­ery for the Nan­jing-Shang­hai Rail­way.</p>
    <p>Check out her seal on the bot­tom of the dishes, dis­played on top of a mir­ror, which uses her Chi­nese name Ho Zhang Liy­ing. Ho refers to her sec­ond hus­band, Ho Yung Chi.</p>
    <p>3 LO­TUS SYM­PHONY (1962, above)</p>
    <p>In true Im­pres­sion­ist tra­di­tion – think Claude Monet’s wa­ter lilies and Paul Cezanne’s Mont Sainte-Vic­toire – Chen spent three weeks of her hol­i­day sim­ply paint­ing the lo­tus pond at a friend’s home.</p>
    <p>This can­vas, on loan from Shang­hai’s Long</p>
    <p>Mu­seum, is hung next to an­other smaller work,</p>
    <p>Lo­tus In A Breeze, that is part of the Na­tional</p>
    <p>Gallery Sin­ga­pore’s collection.</p>
    <p>The mu­si­cal ti­tle is apt as there is har­mony in the ar­range­ment of the twin­ing stems and com­ple­men­tary shades of blue and green.</p>
    <p>She painted works en plein air in Im­pres­sion­ist fash­ion, work­ing quickly to cap­ture light and colour.</p>
    <p>4 CITYSCAPE OF BEI­JING (1945-1949, above)</p>
    <p>This work, on loan from the Fukuoka Asian Art Mu­seum, is a show­case of Chen’s tech­ni­cal skills as well as po­lit­i­cal aware­ness.</p>
    <p>The sub­ject is the For­bid­den City’s Merid­ian Gate, the en­trance to the em­peror’s liv­ing quar­ters and ad­min­is­tra­tion. But Chen chooses an un­usual an­gle, fo­cus­ing on the canal and its dis­torted re­flec­tion of the ed­i­fice, while the walls of the City, patchy and dis­coloured, shows the de­crepi­tude of a once-mighty fortress.</p>
    <p>Her father’s rev­o­lu­tion­ary fer­vour and her first hus­band’s for­eign ser­vice ca­reer meant she grew up in a po­lit­i­cally savvy mi­lieu and must have had well-in­formed opin­ions about the up­heavals of the day.</p>
    <p>5 LET­TER FROM CHEN TO SOONG CHING-LING, DATED NOV 2, 1949 (above)</p>
    <p>This let­ter shows Chen was still look­ing to re­turn to China to con­tinue her artis­tic ca­reer in the post-war era.</p>
    <p>Her friend­ship with Madame Sun Yat Sen dates back to their time in Shang­hai’s McTyeire School for Girls. It is an in­trigu­ing peek at her con­nec­tion with the leg­endary Soong sis­ter and a re­flec­tion of the in­ti­mate cir­cles of power and in­flu­ence in early 20th-cen­tury China.</p>
    <p>It is also full of details and nu­ances to pore over, from Chen’s re­quest to Soong, whom she ad­dresses by her Chris­tian name of Rosa­mond, for in­ter­ces­sion for a pos­si­ble com­mis­sion, to her prom­ise to pur­chase goods for which Soong has al­ready sent money.</p>
