    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Over four decades af­ter ter­ror­is­ing beach­go­ers in Jaws (1975), the block­buster movie’s 7.6m shark model has been in­stalled at the lon­gawaited Os­cars mu­seum in Los An­ge­les, it was an­nounced on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>“Bruce the Shark”, ru­moured to have earned its nick­name from direc­tor Steven Spiel­berg’s ra­zor­sharp lawyer, now lurks 9m above the third floor of the Academy Mu­seum, which is set to open in April next year.</p>
    <p>The fi­bre­glass preda­tor is the only re­main­ing ver­sion cre­ated for the clas­sic movie, but with Jaws mea­sur­ing nearly 1.5m wide, it was too large for the build­ing’s lifts and had to be l ev­ered in by crane through the win­dow.</p>
    <p>“It’s been a l ong j our­ney for Bruce since he was ac­quired in 2016, and we couldn’t be hap­pier to wel­come him to his new home,” said mu­seum pres­i­dent Bill Kramer.</p>
    <p>Weigh­ing more than 540kg, it is the largest ob­ject so far in the col­lec­tion of the up­com­ing Academy Mu­seum of Mo­tion Pic­tures – a project by the body or­gan­is­ing Hol­ly­wood’s Os­cars, dreamt up nearly a cen­tury ago but be­set with de­lays.</p>
    <p>Billed as “the world’s premier in­sti­tu­tion ded­i­cated to the art and sci­ence of movies”, the mu­seum will show­case some 13 mil­lion pho­to­graphs, scripts, cos­tumes and props, in­clud­ing late ac­tress Judy Gar­land’s ruby slip­pers from Wizard Of Oz (1939) and late ac­tor Bela Lu­gosi’s cape from Drac­ula (1931).</p>
    <p>The mu­seum is due to open on April 30, al­though all in­door mu­se­ums in Los An­ge­les are now closed due to Covid-19 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The fu­tur­is­tic mu­seum con­tains a 1,000-seat theatre in­side a seem­ingly sus­pended glass, steel and con­crete orb de­signed by Ital­ian ar­chi­tect Renzo Pi­ano, con­nected by sky bridges to a con­verted de­part­ment store hous­ing the main gal­leries – and the shark.</p>
    <p>“We look for­ward to our open­ing, when mu­seum vis­i­tors can en­gage with our ex­hi­bi­tions, ex­pe­ri­ence our beau­ti­ful Renzo Pian­ode­signed build­ing, and come face to face with one of the most iconic char­ac­ters in film his­tory,” added Mr Kramer.</p>
