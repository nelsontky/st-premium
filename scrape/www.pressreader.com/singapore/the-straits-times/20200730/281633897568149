    <p>Three unions were given the green light to go on strike, if nec­es­sary, to pre­vent a com­pany from go­ing ahead with planned re­trench­ments uni­lat­er­ally, labour chief Ng Chee Meng said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>In­dus­trial ac­tion was averted af­ter air­craft main­te­nance, re­pair and over­haul firm Ea­gle Ser­vices Asia cor­rected its re­trench­ment process and reached an am­i­ca­ble agree­ment with the unions.</p>
    <p>The firm had not fol­lowed the due process for re­trench­ment when it went ahead to in­form some work­ers last week that they might be laid off, even be­fore talks with the unions con­cluded, the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) said in a joint state­ment with the unions yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>They had stepped in to stop any fur­ther ac­tion by the com­pany un­til an agree­ment could be reached.</p>
    <p>“The lack of trans­parency and dis­re­gard for ne­go­ti­a­tions with the unions is not ac­cept­able and is not how a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise should be con­ducted,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng, who is NTUC’s sec­re­tary­gen­eral, said in a Face­book post that the com­pany and NTUC, as well as the aero­space and avi­a­tion unions, had been in tense ne­go­ti­a­tions over the past week “to fight for a fair and dig­ni­fied re­trench­ment”.</p>
    <p>“While NTUC re­spects man­age­ment’s needed mea­sures to keep the busi­ness vi­able, we will stand up for our work­ers’ dig­nity, in­ter­ests and fair play,” he added.</p>
    <p>“To let ev­ery­one un­der­stand that NTUC will stand up to pro­tect our work­ers, I au­tho­rised our unions to pre­pare for in­dus­trial ac­tion should it be­come nec­es­sary to per­suade man­age­ment not to take uni­lat­eral de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>“We wanted a fair ne­go­ti­a­tion. The three unions con­ducted a se­cret bal­lot and work­ers gave over­whelm­ing sup­port to pur­sue le­gal in­dus­trial ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, it was not needed. When the ne­go­ti­a­tions con­cluded, the par­ties had jointly re­viewed the fi­nal re­trench­ment name list of more than 140 work­ers, of which around 44 per cent are Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>On the ini­tial list, which had 144 work­ers, about 56 per cent were Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Work­ers and unions raised con­cerns a week ago, when on July 22, the man­age­ment of Ea­gle Ser­vices Asia pro­ceeded to ask spe­cific em­ploy­ees to leave work be­fore fi­nal­is­ing the name list with the unions. Oth­ers were de­nied en­try.</p>
    <p>This was de­spite on­go­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions with the Air Trans­port Ex­ec­u­tive Staff Union, SIA En­gi­neer­ing Com­pany En­gi­neers and Ex­ec­u­tives Union, and Sin­ga­pore Air­lines Staff Union since early this month.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing talks, Ea­gle Ser­vices Asia – a unionised com­pany with the three unions separately rep­re­sent­ing ad­min­is­tra­tive of­fi­cers, en­gi­neers and tech­ni­cians – con­ceded that the re­trench­ment process could have been bet­ter man­aged and made ad­just­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said: “I am glad that calm and good sense pre­vailed ul­ti­mately.” The par­ties had re­viewed the se­lec­tion cri­te­ria and list of re­trenched em­ploy­ees to en­sure that as far as pos­si­ble, the Sin­ga­porean core is safe­guarded, while giv­ing due con­sid­er­a­tions to its for­eign work­ers, he added.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to get­ting a fair com­pen­sa­tion pack­age for af­fected work­ers, the unions had also ne­go­ti­ated for an ad­di­tional train­ing grant for af­fected union mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Ea­gle Ser­vices Asia, a joint ven­ture be­tween SIA En­gi­neer­ing Com­pany and Amer­i­can aero­space man­u­fac­turer Pratt & Whit­ney, told The Straits Times it had con­sid­ered re­trench­ment only af­ter im­ple­ment­ing other cost-con­tain­ment mea­sures, “such as a tem­po­rary salary re­duc­tion and short work week, can­celled merit in­creases, hir­ing freezes and dis­cre­tionary spend­ing cuts”.</p>
    <p>“Em­ployee de­par­tures are never easy,” said the firm. “This is un­for­tu­nately a re­sult of cur­rent mar­ket con­di­tions we are fac­ing, in­clud­ing cus­tomer-driven vol­ume de­clines due to a gen­er­a­tional pan­demic no one could fore­see.”</p>
    <p>Af­fected staff – some of whom have been with the firm for decades – had ex­pressed dis­ap­point­ment with the way the sit­u­a­tion was han­dled.</p>
    <p>NTUC, which last Fri­day pro­posed a Fair Re­trench­ment Frame­work, yes­ter­day re­it­er­ated that com­pa­nies should con­sider re­trench­ments only as a last re­sort.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said NTUC un­der­stands that these are tough times. “Nonethe­less, there must still be fair play and proper process ac­corded to af­fected work­ers,” he added.</p>
    <p>The lack of trans­parency and dis­re­gard for ne­go­ti­a­tions with the unions is not ac­cept­able and is not how a re­trench­ment ex­er­cise should be con­ducted.</p>
