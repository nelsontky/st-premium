    <p>Re­trenched work­ers in Sin­ga­pore were able to find jobs de­spite weaker hir­ing sen­ti­ments, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey re­leased yes­ter­day by the Man­power Min­istry (MOM).</p>
    <p>Thirty-nine per cent of work­ers who were laid off in the first quar­ter of this year were able to find jobs by June. In 2018, 47 per cent of work­ers re­trenched in the first quar­ter had found jobs by June that year.</p>
    <p>“It was a drop, but it didn’t fall off the cliff,” Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo noted yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey of 2,160 Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents also found that 60 per cent of those who had found jobs by June this year did not take a pay cut of more than 5 per cent.</p>
    <p>De­spite the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic on the econ­omy, com­pa­nies con­tin­ued to hire dur­ing the sec­ond quar­ter, though at a slower pace, a sur­vey by the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) found.</p>
    <p>Re­trenched work­ers were able to find jobs, even with weaker hir­ing sen­ti­ment, and they did not ex­pe­ri­ence size­able pay cuts, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said yes­ter­day dur­ing her weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion report.</p>
    <p>The sur­vey of 2,160 Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents re­trenched in the first quar­ter of this year was con­ducted by MOM in June.</p>
    <p>It found that 39 per cent of these work­ers were able to find jobs by June this year – slightly lower than in the same pe­riod in 2018, when 47 per cent of work­ers re­trenched in the first quar­ter had found jobs by June that year.</p>
    <p>“It was a drop, but it didn’t fall off the cliff,” said Mrs Teo, who was speak­ing at Ma­rina Bay Sands dur­ing a press con­fer­ence that was also at­tended by Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing.</p>
    <p>“We are con­tin­u­ing to mon­i­tor this group of work­ers to see what hap­pens next. But ba­si­cally, the point to keep in mind is that even in good times, which 2018 was, it does take a while for re­trenched work­ers to get back into em­ploy­ment,” she added.</p>
    <p>Of those who had found jobs by June this year, 60 per cent did not take a pay cut of more than 5 per cent, and about half, or 53 per cent, switched to a dif­fer­ent in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Seven in 10 of them also found a job within a month.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo added that pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs) and those in their 30s and 40s were more likely to have found jobs.</p>
    <p>JOBS SIT­U­A­TION IN TOURISM SEC­TOR</p>
    <p>So far, more than 1,400 work­ers from more than 100 ho­tels and tourism com­pa­nies have been, or are be­ing, re­trained and re­de­ployed to new roles un­der two reskilling pro­grammes for the tourism sec­tor by Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG).</p>
    <p>The Job Re­design Reskilling Pro­gramme for the Ho­tel In­dus­try, and the Dig­i­tal Mar­ket­ing Reskilling Pro­gramme for Meet­ings, In­cen­tives, Con­fer­ences, Ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice), At­trac­tions and Tour and Travel Sec­tors were rolled out in Fe­bru­ary as part of Covid-19 sup­port mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers have also tapped the En­hanced Train­ing Sup­port Pack­age so their work­force can learn new skills, with about 28,000 train­ing places filled, said MOM.</p>
    <p>Since April, more than 2,400 job, trainee­ship, com­pany at­tach­ment and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties have been made avail­able by more than 220 com­pa­nies un­der SGUnited Jobs and Skills pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>About 41 per cent of these are in PMET roles, such as con­fer­ence and event plan­ners, sys­tem an­a­lysts and mar­ket­ing sales ex­ec­u­tives, with many of them be­ing longer-term roles, said MOM.</p>
    <p>Be­tween April and July, more than 900 work­ers found jobs or took on new roles in tourism through WSG pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>About 87 per cent were mid­ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als who par­tic­i­pated in career con­ver­sion pro­grammes, and of these, about half were aged 40 and above.</p>
    <p>Fresh and re­cent grad­u­ates as well as mid-career job seekers look­ing to join the tourism sec­tor can ap­ply for trainee­ships or com­pany at­tach­ments un­der the SGUnited Trainee­ships and SGUnited Mid­Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>These in­clude train­ing for roles such as events or­gan­iser or plan­ner, concierge, house­keep­ing su­per­vi­sor and guest services su­per­vi­sor or ex­ec­u­tive, or in ar­eas such as dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing, so­cial me­dia mar­ket­ing and busi­ness an­a­lyt­ics.</p>
    <p>Last month, WSG con­ducted 50 outreach and en­gage­ment ac­tiv­i­ties across Sin­ga­pore, reach­ing out to 12,200 job seekers.</p>
    <p>KEEP­ING AN EYE</p>
    <p>We are con­tin­u­ing to mon­i­tor this group of work­ers to see what hap­pens next. But ba­si­cally, the point to keep in mind is that even in good times, which 2018 was, it does take a while for re­trenched work­ers to get back into em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>MAN­POWER MIN­IS­TER JOSEPHINE TEO, on the 2,160 Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents re­trenched in the first quar­ter of this year who were sur­veyed by MOM.</p>
