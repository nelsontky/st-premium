    <p>China stands ready to strengthen ex­changes and co­op­er­a­tion with Germany on Covid-19 vac­cines and push for the vac­cines to be fairly dis­trib­uted as a global public good, es­pe­cially for the ben­e­fit of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries, said Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi made the re­marks on Tues­day in a phone con­ver­sa­tion with Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel.</p>
    <p>Re­call­ing that he and Dr Merkel both at­tended the Group of 20 sum­mit days ago, Mr Xi noted that both sides ad­vo­cate up­hold­ing mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, boost­ing in­ter­na­tional co­op­er­a­tion, join­ing forces against the coro­n­avirus disease, rein­vig­o­rat­ing the world econ­omy, and jointly tack­ling global chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, with Europe and some other re­gions of the world fac­ing the test of a sec­ond wave of the pan­demic, it re­mains a top pri­or­ity for all par­ties to work to­gether to fight the spread, Mr Xi stressed.</p>
    <p>Since the on­set of the pan­demic, he noted, China and Germany have kept com­mu­ni­ca­tion in a flex­i­ble way, with prac­ti­cal co­op­er­a­tion continuing to ad­vance.</p>
    <p>China is ac­tively fos­ter­ing a new de­vel­op­ment pat­tern and stead­fastly ex­pand­ing do­mes­tic de­mand and open­ing up, which will bring new op­por­tu­ni­ties to Germany, Mr Xi pointed out, adding that China also hopes Germany and the Euro­pean Union will be open to Chi­nese en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>He sug­gested the two sides main­tain mu­tual re­spect and al­ways stick to the over­all di­rec­tion of di­a­logue and co­op­er­a­tion, and the gen­eral prin­ci­ple of mu­tual ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>He also con­veyed his hope that the new round of China-Germany in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal con­sul­ta­tions will make plans for the two coun­tries’ co­op­er­a­tion in var­i­ous fields.</p>
    <p>Point­ing out that China-EU co­op­er­a­tion is gain­ing more global and strate­gic sig­nif­i­cance amid a com­pli­cated in­ter­na­tional sit­u­a­tion, Mr Xi said the two sides need to en­hance mu­tual trust and co­op­er­a­tion, strengthen ex­changes and mu­tual learn­ing, safe­guard mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism and im­prove global gover­nance.</p>
    <p>China is ready to main­tain con­tin­u­ous close com­mu­ni­ca­tion with the EU on their ma­jor agen­das for the next phase and to strive to con­clude China-EU in­vest­ment treaty ne­go­ti­a­tions as sched­uled, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi also called for joint ef­forts to pro­mote the es­tab­lish­ment of</p>
    <p>China-EU di­a­logue mech­a­nisms on the environmen­t and cli­mate as well as dig­i­tal co­op­er­a­tion, and in­ject ro­bust im­pe­tus into the de­vel­op­ment of the China-EU com­pre­hen­sive strate­gic part­ner­ship un­der the new cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel noted that the world is un­der­go­ing pro­found changes and that Europe is fac­ing the im­pact of an­other wave of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The fact that China has done a good job in Covid-19 preven­tion and con­trol and taken the lead in eco­nomic re­cov­ery is good news for Ger­man en­ter­prises, she said, ex­press­ing the hope that both sides will in­crease com­mu­ni­ca­tion on vac­cine co­op­er­a­tion and push for­ward co­op­er­a­tion in such fields as trade, in­vest­ment and new-en­ergy ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>Germany also con­grat­u­lates China on hav­ing signed the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship trade deal with rel­e­vant par­ties, and hopes to step up ef­forts with China to push for con­clud­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions on the EUChina in­vest­ment treaty by the end of this year.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel said Germany highly ap­pre­ci­ates China’s an­nounce­ment of its medium- and longterm tar­gets and vi­sions for cli­mate change re­sponse, and hopes to deepen bi­lat­eral co­op­er­a­tion in such ar­eas as cli­mate change and eco­log­i­cal environmen­t.</p>
    <p>Germany stands ready to con­tinue to main­tain close com­mu­ni­ca­tion with China over ma­jor Germany-China and EU-China po­lit­i­cal agen­das for the next phase, she said.</p>
