    <p>Singapore stu­dents once again came out tops in the In­ter­na­tional Bac­calau­re­ate (IB) diploma ex­ams, ac­cord­ing to re­sults re­leased last week, out­shin­ing their global peers. The Sun­day Times finds out why stu­dents here do so well in the two-year pre-univer­sity pro­gramme that Singapore joined in 2005, whether tu­ition and drilling play a part in their suc­cess, and how the IB pre­pares them for univer­sity and life.</p>
    <p>Singapore stu­dents came out tops in the lat­est In­ter­na­tional Bac­calau­re­ate (IB) diploma re­sults re­leased last Mon­day, out­shin­ing their global peers.</p>
    <p>Of the 99 stu­dents world­wide who at­tained the per­fect score of 45 points in the exam last Novem­ber, more than half – 55 – were from schools in Singapore.</p>
    <p>Ever since it joined the two-year pre-univer­sity pro­gramme in 2005, the Repub­lic has sur­passed global stan­dards, con­sis­tently pro­duc­ing more than half of the top scor­ers world­wide at the IB’s Novem­ber sit­ting.</p>
    <p>Singapore ac­counted for 35 of 69 per­fect scor­ers glob­ally in 2019’s Novem­ber ses­sion. The year be­fore, the fig­ure was 38 out of 68.</p>
    <p>Only a hand­ful of lo­cal schools – An­glo-Chi­nese School (In­de­pen­dent), or ACS(I); St Joseph’s In­sti­tu­tion (SJI); School of the Arts Singapore (Sota); and Singapore Sports School – of­fer the IB Diploma Pro­gramme (IBDP).</p>
    <p>Stu­dents in the in­ter­na­tion­alschool arms of ACS, SJI and Hwa Chong also take the IB.</p>
    <p>The lat­est ad­di­tion is Madrasah Alju­nied Al-Is­lamiah, which saw its first batch of 25 stu­dents start the IBDP in 2019.</p>
    <p>In to­tal, 28 in­sti­tu­tions in Singapore, in­clud­ing in­ter­na­tional schools like the Over­seas Fam­ily School, of­fer the IB pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>WHY SINGAPORE ACES THE IB</p>
    <p>One rea­son stu­dents here tend to fare well in the IB is that some of the schools that of­fer the pro­gramme take in bet­ter stu­dents to be­gin with, ob­servers said.</p>
    <p>Na­tional In­sti­tute of Ed­u­ca­tion don Jason Tan said: “There’s an en­trenched cul­ture of want­ing to do well in ex­ams in Singapore. We’re talk­ing about the more pres­ti­gious schools where, early, all of the stu­dents are al­ready highly mo­ti­vated aca­dem­i­cally.</p>
    <p>“That car­ries over whether you’re in the A-level or IB track, be­cause you know that at the end of the pro­gramme, you are gun­ning for univer­sity ac­cess, and stu­dents would be very fo­cused on that.”</p>
    <p>SJI prin­ci­pal Adrian Danker said stu­dents come into the IB pro­gramme with strong aca­demic foun­da­tions, whether from the In­te­grated Pro­gramme or the Olevel track. “It gives them a head start and al­lows them to go deep into the dif­fer­ent sub­jects.”</p>
    <p>A grow­ing en­rich­ment in­dus­try could also be a fac­tor in stu­dents’ suc­cess in the IB.</p>
    <p>Tu­ition cen­tre IB Su­per has had a 30 per cent in­crease in lo­cal IB stu­dents in the past four years, while another cen­tre, Mind­lab In­ter­na­tional, has seen a 20 per cent yearon-year in­crease in en­rol­ment of lo­cal IB stu­dents in the past five years.</p>
    <p>Mr Matthew Lee, Mind­lab’s pro­gramme direc­tor, said: “Most of the stu­dents come to get coach­ing in exam prepa­ra­tion and brush­ing up on im­por­tant top­ics.”</p>
    <p>Tu­ition cen­tre Quin­tes­sen­tial Ed­u­ca­tion said it has recorded a nearly three­fold in­crease in the num­ber of lo­cal IB stu­dents in the past five years.</p>
    <p>Mr Sean Lim, one of its tu­tors, said: “We no­tice that lo­cal stu­dents of­ten ask for help in the course­work com­po­nent – for in­stance, in re­search method­ol­ogy, ap­pli­ca­tion of aca­demic the­o­ries or fram­ing and gen­er­at­ing ar­gu­ments.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the uptick in IB tu­ition, IB Su­per’s founder Bel Hwang said lo­cal schools also pro­vide strong foun­da­tions for their stu­dents.</p>
    <p>She cited ACS(I)’s In­te­grated Pro­gramme, which pre­pares stu­dents in the first four years for the IBDP, and a sim­i­lar in­te­grated arts and aca­demic cur­ricu­lum at Sota.</p>
    <p>“Our lo­cal stu­dents are gen­er­ally in­dus­tri­ous and fo­cused on meet­ing the nu­mer­ous dead­lines in IB school­work. They are also grade­con­scious, and al­ways do their work with an eye on their ex­pected grades,” she said.</p>
    <p>Dr Yuen Wei Hao, direc­tor of stud­ies for another tu­ition cen­tre, EIB Ed­u­ca­tion, re­it­er­ated the point that lo­cal schools which of­fer IB “typ­i­cally have stronger co­horts of stu­dents... com­pared with the na­tional av­er­age, as well as good sup­port from the schools, both in terms of the sub­ject teach­ing and how to ap­proach sub­ject se­lec­tion”.</p>
    <p>About 20 per cent of sign-ups each year at his cen­tre come from IB stu­dents at lo­cal schools.</p>
    <p>How­ever, teach­ers said the IB cur­ricu­lum does not al­low for drilling, and do­ing well re­quires deep and crit­i­cal think­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Tang Woh Un, SJI’s IBDP co­or­di­na­tor, said: “There is no 10-year se­ries for IB. Exam ques­tions aren’t re­peated and do not en­cour­age mem­ory work.</p>
    <p>“Know­ing facts with­out real un­der­stand­ing won’t get you any­where. It’s more about ap­pli­ca­tion of con­cepts to get so­lu­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Jarett Kan, ACS(I)’s direc­tor of af­fec­tive cur­ricu­lum, which cov­ers stu­dent de­vel­op­ment and well­be­ing, said: “We ex­pose stu­dents to dif­fer­ent types of exam ques­tions, and they do prac­tise. But there are so many per­mu­ta­tions of ques­tions, and no model an­swers.</p>
    <p>“There’s also greater em­pha­sis on ap­ply­ing con­cep­tual un­der­stand­ing to a va­ri­ety of ques­tions.”</p>
    <p>Re­search, along with forms of as­sess­ment like oral record­ings, is a key as­pect of the IB course­work over two years, mak­ing up about 20 per cent to 40 per cent of the over­all sub­ject score. The fi­nal exam makes up the rest of the score.</p>
    <p>Teach­ers said the IB also gives stu­dents space to dis­cover and pur­sue their in­ter­ests, through re­search top­ics of their choice.</p>
    <p>Mr Tang said the 4,000-word ex­tended es­say com­po­nent – akin to a mini-the­sis – gives stu­dents free­dom to ex­plore top­ics across bound­aries and dis­ci­plines.</p>
    <p>Mr Kan said: “Be­cause stu­dents get to choose their own re­search ques­tions, the mo­ti­va­tion to find the an­swers is strong.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, i n his­tory l ast year, I had stu­dents re­search­ing... the rea­sons for low birth rates in Singapore dur­ing the 1970s, and the rea­sons why the United States went to war with Iraq in 2003.”</p>
    <p>GO­ING BE­YOND GRADES</p>
    <p>Singapore stu­dents may be stel­lar per­form­ers, but in re­cent years, lo­cal schools have with­held the num­ber of their top IB scor­ers.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows the Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry’s prac­tice of not re­leas­ing such in­for­ma­tion for other na­tional ex­am­i­na­tions, in an ef­fort to quell the fix­a­tion on aca­demic re­sults.</p>
    <p>Fa­ther (Dr) Adrian said SJI chose the IB for its post-sec­ondary track as its pro­gramme is in line with its Lasal­lian phi­los­o­phy of de­vel­op­ing char­ac­ter in stu­dents.</p>
    <p>“This Singapore ob­ses­sion about per­fect scores wor­ries me, be­cause it puts ex­treme pres­sure on stu­dents and par­ents,” he said.</p>
    <p>“With all the ex­tra com­po­nents, the IB aims to nur­ture qual­i­ties like be­com­ing a bet­ter per­son, and that’s what ed­u­ca­tion is about.”</p>
    <p>LEARN­ING SKILLS FOR LIFE</p>
    <p>While some stu­dents said they strug­gled ini­tially with the in­de­pen­dent style of learn­ing in the IB pro­gramme, they adapted quickly.</p>
    <p>SJI grad­u­ate Por­tia Lim, 18, said: “I felt like I was thrown into the deep end at first. I found the cur­ricu­lum very chal­leng­ing, and it re­quires you to be con­sis­tent, meet­ing back-to-back dead­lines.</p>
    <p>“But I chose the IB af­ter speak­ing to se­niors who said it would pre­pare me well for univer­sity, and I didn’t want to do some­thing simi</p>
    <p>lar to the O lev­els again.”</p>
    <p>Stu­dents and teach­ers said the IB’s em­pha­sis on self-di­rected learn­ing and re­search skills is use­ful for univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Mr Kan said ev­ery sub­ject has a re­search com­po­nent, which mir­rors the na­ture and work of aca­demics.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents are ex­posed to think­ing ap­proaches across dis­ci­plines, be­yond know­ing sub­ject mat­ter, he said. “The world is so com­plex now, you need to have such think­ing pro­cesses to solve prob­lems.”</p>
    <p>ACS(I) grad­u­ate Lau­ren Tse, 18, said: “It pushed a lot of us out of our com­fort zones, when we had to come up with ques­tions our­selves, con­sider dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in study­ing lit­er­a­ture texts, stu­dents would also need to think about his­tor­i­cal con­texts and eco­nomic con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Apart from aca­demic skills, the IB pro­gramme also al­lows stu­dents to learn time man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Singapore Sports School grad­u­ate Ni­cholas Rach­madi, 19, said he could spread out his course­work and exam sched­ule ac­cord­ing to his sports com­mit­ments, as he took up an ex­tended IBDP path­way.</p>
    <p>The triath­lete spent three years in­stead of the usual two years on the IB route.</p>
    <p>Singapore Sports School as­sis­tant vice-prin­ci­pal (aca­demics) Lim Han Yong said the longer run­way al­lows stu­dent-ath­letes to take more own­er­ship of their time and do well in both sports and stud­ies.</p>
    <p>“It also in­stils in them in­de­pen­dence and self-dis­ci­pline.”</p>
    <p>The IB also en­cour­ages stu­dents to think deeply be­yond their stud­ies, said educators.</p>
    <p>Fa­ther Adrian said: “In the two years, stu­dents grow up and find their voice in the IB... They are all pas­sion­ate about some­thing, and it’s not just about knowl­edge and skills. Some might take a gap year to do ser­vice learn­ing projects over­seas in­stead of go­ing to univer­sity straight.”</p>
    <p>As part of IB, stu­dents need to take up cre­ativ­ity, ac­tiv­ity and ser­vice projects, which are meant to be av­enues for per­sonal growth.</p>
    <p>To ful­fil those re­quire­ments, Lau­ren chose to give pi­ano lessons, picked up fris­bee skills, and planned and went on a trip to China to teach chil­dren.</p>
    <p>She in­tends to study lib­eral arts and go into pol­i­cy­mak­ing in fu­ture, with the con­cerns of un­der­priv­i­leged fam­i­lies in mind.</p>
    <p>“The IB pushed us to think of com­mu­ni­ties out­side school, in­stead of get­ting so caught up with our iden­ti­ties as stu­dents,” she said.</p>
