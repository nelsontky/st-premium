    <p>A group of bank lenders has suc­ceeded – on their sec­ond try – in get­ting the High Court’s ap­proval to file an ap­pli­ca­tion to put Hyflux un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment af­ter two years of re­struc­tur­ing still left the wa­ter treat­ment firm’s cred­i­tors high and dry.</p>
    <p>A group of bank lenders has suc­ceeded – on their sec­ond try – to get the High Court’s ap­proval to file an ap­pli­ca­tion to put Hyflux un­der ju­di­cial man­age­ment af­ter two years of re­struc­tur­ing still left the wa­ter-treat­ment firm’s cred­i­tors high and dry.</p>
    <p>High Court Jus­tice Aedit Ab­dul­lah yes­ter­day granted the ap­pli­ca­tion by an un­se­cured work­ing group (UWG) of banks com­pris­ing Mizuho, KfW, Bangkok Bank, BNP Paribas, Stan­dard Char­tered Bank, CTBC Bank and the Korea De­vel­op­ment Bank to be carved out of Hyflux’s debt mora­to­rium which gives it court pro­tec­tion from cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>He al­lowed these cred­i­tors, which ar­gued that there was still no vi­able and bind­ing re­struc­tur­ing plan, to file an ap­pli­ca­tion by Aug 7 to ap­point ju­di­cial man­agers over Hyflux.</p>
    <p>But Se­cu­ri­ties In­vestors As­so­ci­a­tion (Sin­ga­pore) – or Sias – chief David Ger­ald said that this “does not nec­es­sar­ily mean JM is inevitable” as this is yet to be de­cided by the court.</p>
    <p>A hear­ing date has not been set for the ju­di­cial man­age­ment ap­pli­ca­tion. Hyflux’s debt mora­to­rium has been ex­tended from July 30 un­til the hear­ing date.</p>
    <p>Lawyers for UWG, which say the group now col­lec­tively hold more than $900 mil­lion of debt, had first ap­plied for a carve-out in May last year, but failed. But Jus­tice Aedit said then that the ap­pli­ca­tion could be re­vived if cir­cum­stances change. “A mora­to­rium is meant to be a tem­po­rary so­lu­tion to al­low a com­pany to put some­thing to­gether... but it doesn’t mean I can give a blank cheque for the mora­to­rium go­ing for­ward,” he said at a hear­ing last May.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, he granted an ap­pli­ca­tion by ESR-Reit to be carved out of the mora­to­rium. This will take ef­fect in six weeks from Sept 7, on con­di­tion that rent for the in­ter­ven­ing six-week pe­riod is paid by Hyflux</p>
    <p>Mem­brane to ESR-Reit by Aug 3, Hyflux said.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral po­ten­tial suit­ors for Hyflux have sur­faced i n re­cent weeks, in­clud­ing one on Sun­day – an un­named North Amer­ica-based fund man­ager that has a “strong” track record of in­vest­ing in in­fra­struc­ture, tech­nol­ogy and real es­tate glob­ally. Other po­ten­tial in­vestors in­cluded Mid­dle East­ern util­ity firm Utico, Pi­son In­vest­ments, Uni­le­gend In­vest­ments and Aqua Munda.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully, be­tween now and the hear­ing date of the JM ap­pli­ca­tion, some of the of­fers will close,” a source close to the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>An in­vi­ta­tion mem­o­ran­dum was is­sued ear­lier this month from Pi­son, a Sin­ga­pore-in­cor­po­rated in­vest­ment ve­hi­cle for In­done­sian mag­nate Johnny Wid­jaja, who is in­ter­ested to in­vest up to $300 mil­lion in Hyflux, in­clud­ing buy­ing up the ex­ist­ing debt of the se­nior un­se­cured cred­i­tors.</p>
    <p>Pi­son said that $200 mil­lion of Mr Wid­jaja’s funds in Bank Mandiri (Persero) have been “ir­re­vo­ca­bly blocked and re­served” un­til July 10, 2021, for the in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>In a July 25 af­fi­davit ask­ing the court to ex­tend Hyflux’s debt mora­to­rium, Mr Wid­jaja said: “Pi­son’s in­vi­ta­tion ad­vi­sor has been re­ceiv­ing calls and e-mail en­quiries from el­i­gi­ble cred­i­tors on an al­most daily ba­sis. This in­di­cates that there are el­i­gi­ble cred­i­tors who see the in­vi­ta­tion mem­o­ran­dum as a vi­able plan.”</p>
    <p>The ex­pi­ra­tion dead­line for el­i­gi­ble cred­i­tors to sub­mit their ten­der ap­pli­ca­tion forms is Aug 17, and the ac­cep­tance dead­line is Sept 25. “Sub­ject to the terms of the in­vi­ta­tion mem­o­ran­dum, Pi­son in­tends to com­plete the pur­chase of the ac­cepted bids by late Oc­to­ber this year,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added Pi­son will en­gage with hold­ers of the Hyflux per­pet­ual se­cu­ri­ties and pref­er­ence shares (PnP) through Sias af­ter the close of the in­vi­ta­tion mem­o­ran­dum.</p>
    <p>Mr Ger­ald said: “There is still time for se­ri­ous of­fer­ors to ta­ble con­crete of­fers. Aqua Munda and Pi­son, which stated that they would make an of­fer to the PnP hold­ers, (should) do so on an ur­gent ba­sis. Hyflux should con­firm as soon as pos­si­ble whether it will ac­cept the re­vised Utico deal and call a scheme meet­ing in the near fu­ture.”</p>
