    <p>Pur­chases of Covid-spe­cific health in­sur­ance poli­cies in India have grown al­most 10 times in a month, mak­ing it the fastest-sell­ing in­sur­ance pol­icy in decades.</p>
    <p>The chair­man of India’s in­sur­ance reg­u­la­tory body, the In­sur­ance Reg­u­la­tory and Devel­op­ment Author­ity (Ir­dai), said on Oct 16 that the mar­ket grew from 1.5 mil­lion ru­pees (S$27,670) to 11 mil­lion ru­pees from last month to this month.</p>
    <p>India has had close to eight mil­lion coro­n­avirus cases, and more than 120,000 peo­ple have died. Although the Min­istry of Health says more peo­ple are re­cov­er­ing than ever and in­fec­tion rates are de­clin­ing, India still records the world’s sec­ond-largest num­ber of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try sources said that since July, 450,000 in­sur­ance claims worth about 67.5 bil­lion ru­pees have been re­ported. Of this, about 300,000 claims worth around 28 bil­lion ru­pees have been set­tled.</p>
    <p>Many In­di­ans were spurred to buy in­sur­ance in July as in­fec­tions peaked and the lock­down was eased.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­han Elango, a 28-year-old tele­vi­sion pro­ducer in Chen­nai, said that it was when India’s pan­demic “sit­u­a­tion got se­ri­ous” that he bought a Covid-spe­cific in­sur­ance pol­icy from Star Health and Al­lied In­sur­ance com­pany for a cover of about $9,200. It was his first health in­sur­ance pol­icy.</p>
    <p>“One of my rel­a­tives was ad­mit­ted to a pri­vate hos­pi­tal with Covid, but in six days the fam­ily opted for home treat­ment be­cause they could not af­ford to pay more bills. I too can’t bear the ex­pense, so I got a Covid in­sur­ance pol­icy,” he added.</p>
    <p>Treat­ment in gov­ern­ment hos­pi­tals is free of charge, but a short­age of beds and lack of trust about safety have made many In­di­ans opt for pri­vate hos­pi­tals. Some state govern­ments have reg­u­lated Covid-19 test­ing and treat­ment fees, but many hos­pi­tals have still been charg­ing con­tro­ver­sially high prices for san­i­ta­tion, ad­mis­sion and per­sonal safety equip­ment of med­i­cal staff.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral pa­tients and health rights ac­tivists have chal­lenged this in courts across India.</p>
    <p>As in­fected In­di­ans strug­gled with enor­mous bills and re­jected claims on their ex­ist­ing health in­sur­ance poli­cies, the Ir­dai de­signed two stan­dard Covid-spe­cific prod­ucts called Corona Kavach (Ar­mour) and Corona Rak­shak (Pro­tec­tor) in June.</p>
    <p>Based on these guide­lines, many in­sur­ance com­pa­nies have rolled out poli­cies that will cover the treat­ment cost of Covid-19. Corona Kavach is an in­dem­nity-type plan for in­di­vid­u­als and fam­i­lies to get their hos­pi­tal bill re­im­bursed up to the sum in­sured.</p>
    <p>A ben­e­fit-based plan, Corona Rak­shak gives hos­pi­talised in­di­vid­u­als a fixed pay­out to cover ex­penses.</p>
    <p>Both are short-term poli­cies, is­sued for 31/ 2, 61/ 2, and 91/2 months.</p>
    <p>The one-time pre­mi­ums are low, rang­ing from 120 ru­pees to 15,000 ru­pees, based on each in­surer’s un­der­writ­ing stan­dards and ex­pec­ta­tions of claim ra­tios, re­ported on­line in­sur­ance re­tailer Pol­i­cybazaar.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has forced cus­tomers to think about larger sum in­sured poli­cies. We have wit­nessed in­creased de­mand for our su­per topup health prod­uct which of­fers sum in­sured of INR 20 lakh (two mil­lion ru­pees) with a de­ductible of INR 5 lakh for a pre­mium of 2,420 ru­pees for cus­tomers be­low 45 years of age,” said HDFC ERGO Gen­eral In­sur­ance pres­i­dent of ac­ci­dent and health Ravi Vish­wanath.</p>
    <p>Some com­pa­nies are also buy­ing Covid-19 in­sur­ance for staff, as a stand­alone pol­icy or as a “topup” to their ex­ist­ing health cover.</p>
    <p>“My com­pany took the pol­icy cover for all em­ploy­ees. They have borne the en­tire cost,” said Ms Sub­hashini Ravichan­dran, a con­tent writer at Cus­tomised En­ergy So­lu­tions in Chen­nai. The pol­icy from Ori­en­tal In­sur­ance for 200,000 ru­pees cov­ers di­ag­nos­tics, hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion, and home care for up to 14 days. The pre­mium was only 600 ru­pees.</p>
    <p>Mr Sanjay Datta, chief of un­der­writ­ing, claims and rein­sur­ance at ICICI Lom­bard, India’s largest pri­vate sec­tor in­surer, said short-term in­sur­ance prod­ucts like the Covid-19 plans were un­prece­dented for India. “It is a cri­sis mit­i­ga­tion prod­uct, in a sense, like ex­tin­guish­ers to put out a fire,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has raised aware­ness about health risks in gen­eral, not just from an old age per­spec­tive. In­di­ans are oth­er­wise very fa­tal­is­tic about dis­ease and death. But now even young peo­ple are tak­ing in­sur­ance.”</p>
