    <p>BEI­JING • China has eased en­try re­stric­tions for na­tion­als from 36 Euro­pean coun­tries, months af­ter thou­sands were left stranded when the coun­try closed its bor­ders and slashed flights to slow the spread of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Al­most all for­eign na­tion­als were for­bid­den from en­ter­ing the coun­try when Bei­jing im­posed the mea­sures in March, even those with Chi­nese work or res­i­dence per­mits or who have fam­ily liv­ing in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>But this week, China said it would re­lax some of the bu­reau­cratic re­quire­ments for Euro­peans hop­ing to reen­ter.</p>
    <p>The new rules will al­low Euro­pean pass­port hold­ers from 36 coun­tries – in­clud­ing France, Ger­many and the UK – with a valid res­i­dence per­mit to ap­ply for a Chi­nese visa with­out an invitation let­ter, ac­cord­ing to a no­tice by the Chi­nese em­bassy in Ber­lin pub­lished yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­one re­turn­ing to China has to reap­ply for a visa, since travel doc­u­ments is­sued be­fore the pan­demic have been nul­li­fied.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, China had al­lowed only a small num­ber of skilled for­eign work­ers to re­turn, with spe­cial of­fi­cial invitation let­ters – a process which proved slow.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry said in a state­ment pub­lished on Mon­day that Euro­pean pass­port hold­ers who qual­ify will now be al­lowed to “ap­ply for a Chi­nese visa free of charge”.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors are still sub­ject to Covid-19 tests and a 14-day quar­an­tine, and will still have to find a plane ticket, af­ter Bei­jing or­dered a dras­tic re­duc­tion in in­ter­na­tional air links at the end of March and ticket prices soared.</p>
    <p>Some of these strict flight quo­tas are also be­ing lifted, with Air France al­lowed to op­er­ate three weekly flights be­tween China and France from the end of this month.</p>
    <p>China has largely brought the spread of Covid-19 un­der con­trol af­ter the dis­ease was first de­tected there late last year, but there has been a se­ries of lo­cal clus­ters in re­cent months.</p>
