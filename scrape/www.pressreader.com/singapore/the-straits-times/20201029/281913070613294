    <p>BAKU/YEREVAN • Azer­bai­jan and Ar­me­nia ac­cused each other of killing civil­ians by shelling cities in and around Nagorno-Karabakh yes­ter­day, in an es­ca­la­tion of a month­long con­flict over the moun­tain en­clave that has de­fied three cease­fires.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan said 19 peo­ple were killed when Ar­me­nian shells hit the town of Barda, north­east of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nian-backed of­fi­cials in</p>
    <p>Nagorno-Karabakh said Az­eri shells had fallen on the en­clave’s two largest cities, killing one per­son. Each side de­nied the other’s claims.</p>
    <p>The worst fight­ing in the South Cau­ca­sus for nearly 30 years has raised fears of a wider war that could suck in Rus­sia and Turkey, an ally of Azer­bai­jan. It also poses a threat to pipe­lines car­ry­ing oil and gas from Azer­bai­jan to world mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia’s de­fence min­istry also con­firmed yes­ter­day that Azer­bai­jan had seized the town of Gubadli be­tween the en­clave and the Ira­nian bor­der, an ap­par­ent mil­i­tary gain that could make a diplo­matic so­lu­tion more dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Nagorno-Karabakh is in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised as part of Azer­bai­jan but is pop­u­lated and con­trolled by eth­nic Ar­me­ni­ans.</p>
    <p>About 30,000 peo­ple were killed in a 1991-94 war in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jan re­jects any so­lu­tion that would leave Ar­me­ni­ans in con­trol of the en­clave, which it con­sid­ers to be il­le­gally oc­cu­pied.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia re­gards the ter­ri­tory as part of its his­toric home­land and says the pop­u­la­tion there needs its pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Azer­bai­jani pres­i­den­tial aide Hik­met Ha­jiyev said Ar­me­nian forces had fired Smerch mis­siles against Barda and the pros­e­cu­tor gen­eral’s of­fice said 19 civil­ians had been killed and 60 wounded. It had ear­lier put the num­ber of deaths at 14.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nian de­fence min­istry spokesman Shushan Stepa­nyan de­nied the claim. “The state­ment of the min­istry of de­fence of Azer­bai­jan that the Armed Forces of Ar­me­nia al­legedly hit the town of Barda with Smerch is ground­less and false,” she said on Face­book.</p>
    <p>The Emer­gency and Res­cue Ser­vice of eth­nic Ar­me­nian-con­trolled Nagorno-Karabakh said shells had fallen on Stepanaker­t, the en­clave’s largest city. It said a civil­ian had been killed by shelling in another city, Shushi, 15km to the south.</p>
    <p>Reuters could not in­de­pen­dently ver­ify the re­ports.</p>
    <p>The Nagorno-Karabakh de­fence min­istry has recorded 1,068 mil­i­tary deaths since fight­ing erupted on Sept 27. Azer­bai­jan has not dis­closed its mil­i­tary ca­su­al­ties. Rus­sia has es­ti­mated as many as 5,000 deaths in all.</p>
    <p>The lat­est of three cease­fires was bro­kered in Wash­ing­ton on Sun­day. United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump called the re­newed fight­ing “dis­ap­point­ing” and Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pompeo urged both sides to pur­sue a diplo­matic so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>The OSCE Minsk Group, formed to me­di­ate the con­flict and led by France, Rus­sia and the United States, is sched­uled to meet the Ar­me­nian and Az­eri for­eign min­is­ters in Geneva today.</p>
    <p>Turkey has de­manded a big­ger role in the group.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, in a phone call with Turk­ish Pres­i­dent Tayyip Er­do­gan on Tues­day, ex­pressed con­cerns over what he said was the in­creased in­volve­ment of fighters from the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>Mr Er­do­gan said yes­ter­day that Turkey was sin­cere in its ef­forts to solve the con­flict and he be­lieved in Rus­sia’s sin­cer­ity. He said he had told Mr Putin that Ar­me­nia was us­ing Kur­dish mil­i­tants.</p>
