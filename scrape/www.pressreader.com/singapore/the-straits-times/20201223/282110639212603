    <p>A pro­jec­tile, be­lieved to be a war relic, was dis­cov­ered at a cor­ner ter­raced unit at Jalan Rabu in Shunfu yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Twelve house­holds were asked to evac­u­ate their homes af­ter it was found.</p>
    <p>The cor­ner ter­raced unit at 43 Jalan Rabu, which is cur­rently un­der con­struc­tion, was cor­doned off, along with the other 12 ter­raced and semi-de­tached houses.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said that they were alerted to the dis­cov­ery of the pro­jec­tile at about 2pm yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Af­ter con­sult­ing the Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces’ Ex­plo­sive Ord­nance Dis­posal team, it was de­cided that the pro­jec­tile would be safely trans­ported to a safe lo­ca­tion for dis­posal, said the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Two po­lice cars and sev­eral po­lice of­fi­cers were seen at the scene when The Straits Times ar­rived at around 5pm. An­other po­lice car ar­rived about 50 min­utes later.</p>
    <p>The road was quiet as most of the evac­u­ated res­i­dents had gone else­where. No con­struc­tion work­ers from the cor­ner unit were seen too.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents were al­lowed to re­turn to their homes at around 6.40pm, though the cor­ner unit re­mained cor­doned off.</p>
    <p>Mr Floris Sprokkre­eff, 46, and his wife Su­san Giri, 37, had been home wait­ing for food de­liv­ery at around 2.30pm when the po­lice knocked on their door. They live di­ag­o­nally across the unit un­der con­struc­tion.</p>
    <p>They quickly grabbed their pets – two dogs on leashes and one cat in a back­pack – as well as their phones and keys, and left.</p>
    <p>“It was a shock when we re­alised what the po­lice of­fi­cers were say­ing, so we were pan­ick­ing to get the dogs and the cat (to come) with us as the cat is usu­ally in the at­tic and never goes out,” said Mr Sprokkre­eff, who works as a vis­ual ef­fects artist.</p>
    <p>Ms Giri, a house­wife, said that she was a bit wor­ried and afraid as this was the first time she had ex­pe­ri­enced such an in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Sprokkre­eff added: “You start to think about what else is in the ground there. I hope they do a thor­ough job check­ing the area.”</p>
    <p>The cou­ple have lived in Jalan Rabu since 2016.</p>
    <p>The unit where the pro­jec­tile was found has been un­der con­struc­tion for al­most two years, and the pre­vi­ous oc­cu­pant was an el­derly woman liv­ing on her own, said Mr Sprokkre­eff.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been look­ing at (the unit) for so long. Just the thought of (the pro­jec­tile) be­ing there all this time is a bit un­nerv­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a con­struc­tion no­tice at the unit, con­struc­tion was per­mit­ted to be­gin on Feb 13 last year and slated for com­ple­tion by April 12 this year.</p>
    <p>The prop­erty is be­ing de­vel­oped by real es­tate devel­op­ment com­pany Sevens Group and cov­ers 3,461 sq ft of land and 9,135 sq ft of liv­ing area. When com­pleted, it will have an at­tic, base­ment and swim­ming pool.</p>
    <p>An­other res­i­dent, who wanted to be known only as Mr Teo, was also asked by the po­lice to evac­u­ate his home, which was a few units down the road from where the pro­jec­tile was dis­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>The re­tiree, who has lived in Jalan Rabu for more than 20 years, said he had been rest­ing from 2pm to 3pm and woke up when the po­lice knocked at his door.</p>
    <p>“They told me (there was) no need to take so much with me so I just brought... my cell­phone and some wa­ter,” said Mr Teo, 68, who lives with his wife and dog.</p>
    <p>Mr Teo said he was not wor­ried as sim­i­lar in­ci­dents where old ex­plo­sives were found and det­o­nated safely have oc­curred else­where in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
