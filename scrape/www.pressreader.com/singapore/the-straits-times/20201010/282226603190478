    <p>RACE 1 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>1 Mon­key Jew­ellery can atone for his poor first-up ef­fort last start. He tracked three-wide and faded out. He is bet­ter than that. He is a twotime course-and-dis­tance win­ner.</p>
    <p>4 Big Luck Champ grabbed third on de­but. He can fig­ure again with slight im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>7 Al­loy King is lightly raced, but has shown glimpses of abil­ity. From Gate 1, he may try to go all the way.</p>
    <p>2 Dublin Star is al­ways around the mark.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>4 Stun­ning Im­pact has abil­ity. He could fi­nally win with more ex­pe­ri­ence. He tri­alled well. From the in­side draw, he can roll for­ward.</p>
    <p>1 Bel­uga could not match the pace first-up over this course and dis­tance. He seems to have im­proved and it would not sur­prise if he wins. 3 So­lar Power sur­prised first-up to fin­ish a close-up sec­ond. He should get a soft run close to the speed.</p>
    <p>6 Sam’s Love is solid and should not be too far away.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>6 Win­ning Strikes caught the eye when win­ning his re­cent bar­rier trial. He is drawn to get the right run and may take plenty of beat­ing. 5 Valiant El­e­gance has had the ben­e­fit of a first-up run. There is good opinion of him and he has the book­ing of French ace An­toine Hamelin. 3 For­tune Master ap­pears to be on an up­ward tra­jec­tory. The draw suits and he hails from the in-form Fran­cis Lui barn.</p>
    <p>4 Inno Legend, who is lightly raced, could win with cham­pion jockey Zac Pur­ton astride.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>10 Speedy Dragon has not won since early last year as a 48-rater in Class 4. Now on a mark of 33 in Class 5, he can score again.</p>
    <p>2 Laos En­light­en­ment might try and pinch this from the front with Al­fred Chan’s 7lb (3.2kg) claim.</p>
    <p>5 Shinealot is still win­less af­ter 18 starts. He has gone close a num­ber of times. He war­rants re­spect.</p>
    <p>7 Nunchuks has been sup­ported in his re­cent races. From the good gate, he gets a great chance to dis­play his best.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>4 Mal­dives caught the eye in his re­cent bar­rier trial at Happy Val­ley. He looks set to re­turn this sea­son with a bang. Gate 2 suits, as does the book­ing of Pur­ton.</p>
    <p>8 Apex Top is bet­ter than his firstup fail­ure sug­gested. With even luck, he is ca­pa­ble of aton­ing for that run, es­pe­cially af­ter fin­ish­ing along­side Mal­dives in his re­cent trial.</p>
    <p>7 The Drive ran well first-up. He should im­prove with that per­for­mance. It would not sur­prise to see him take an­other step for­ward.</p>
    <p>1 Golden Four gets a handy 10lb (4.5kg) claim from ap­pren­tice Jerry Chau. He de­serves re­spect af­ter his last-start close-up sec­ond.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,800M)</p>
    <p>3 Nat­u­ral Storm should rel­ish the step-up from 1,600m to 1,800m, his win­ning dis­tance on July 12. He is drawn to get the right run and should prove dif­fi­cult to reel in from a for­ward po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>8 Ex­al­ta­tion gets the ser­vices of Pur­ton for the first time. He is win­less, but has shown sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ment over a longer trip.</p>
    <p>1 Bullish Glory notched back-to­back wins last term. He will need luck from the rear, but is ca­pa­ble of rat­tling into the plac­ings.</p>
    <p>2 Dy­namic Ea­gle is next best.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>4 Sun­set Watch should ben­e­fit from the fast pace. As a first-up run­ner-up, he looks the one to beat, es­pe­cially with Pur­ton re­plac­ing the sus­pended Karis Tee­tan.</p>
    <p>10 Ka Ying Master is fit af­ter hav­ing had two runs. As a nat­u­ral front run­ner, he should roll for­ward from Gate 4. He could prove tough to reel in, es­pe­cially as he is hav­ing his third run back since his throat surgery.</p>
    <p>6 Czar­son is look­ing to end a streak of two close sec­onds on the dirt. He is favourably drawn and will rel­ish the likely fast pace.</p>
    <p>3 Smart Leader is bet­ter than his last-start strug­gle sug­gested. He can be given an­other chance.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>1 Healthy Happy was im­pres­sive in his re­cent trial, fin­ish­ing sec­ond to Bud­dies on the Sha Tin dirt. He ap­pears for­ward enough to fig­ure on de­but. From the in­side draw, he should get ev­ery chance to do so. His Aus­tralian form was solid.</p>
    <p>9 Com­pas­sion Spirit gets the ser­vices of Pur­ton. He still has got plenty of rating points and it would not sur­prise to see him win.</p>
    <p>11 Clas­sic Posh is look­ing to snap a streak of two run­ner-up ef­forts. He will come flash­ing home.</p>
    <p>2 Su­per Dob­bin has ac­cli­ma­tised in Hong Kong as a South African Group 3 win­ner. He ap­pears to be tak­ing the right steps for­ward.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>1 Star Of Yuen Long has the class to win. He ap­pears des­tined for bet­ter things. Pur­ton re­tains the ride.</p>
    <p>3 Sim­ple El­e­gant is the likely leader. He will look the win­ner for a long way, es­pe­cially from Gate 1, which should al­low him to waste lit­tle petrol to find the front. He is worth tak­ing a chance on.</p>
    <p>4 Win Win re­turned in ex­cel­lent or­der last start. He missed by just half a length. He can run on for the prize money.</p>
    <p>9 Vic­tory Power is con­sis­tent. Ad­mit­tedly, he is un­lucky not to have won more than one race al­ready. He has notched nine sec­onds and six thirds. Must re­spect.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>9 Su­per Star re­turns af­ter a lengthy break from throat surgery. He caught the eye in his re­cent bar­rier trial on the dirt, length­en­ing from the rear to win. He could fire firstup.</p>
    <p>6 Wa­ter Diviner found him­self trapped too far back last start. He has won over this trip be­fore. With a for­ward ride from Gate 3, he can make his pres­ence felt.</p>
    <p>4 Lucky Ex­press could not have been more im­pres­sive last start. It would not shock to see him snare his sec­ond vic­tory from four starts.</p>
    <p>1 Shin­ing Ace should rel­ish the drop to Class 2. He is con­sis­tent and de­serves re­spect.</p>
