    <p>ODENSE (Den­mark) • Nozomi Okuhara showed that she will be a strong con­tender to win bad­minton gold on home soil at next year’s Tokyo Games af­ter de­feat­ing reign­ing Olympic cham­pion Carolina Marin 21-19, 21-17 at the Den­mark Open yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The 2017 world cham­pion re­turned to the win­ners’ cir­cle af­ter a two-year ab­sence in style, hav­ing last won a ti­tle at the 2018 Hong Kong Open.</p>
    <p>“I’m happy! Long time no ti­tle!” Okuhara, a bronze medal­list at the Rio Olympics, told the Bad­minton World Fed­er­a­tion (BWF) web­site.</p>
    <p>“Com­pared to other op­po­nents, Marin is faster and has a harder at­tack. I was fo­cused on de­fence and foot­work, and my feet moved very well today. Over­all the match went well for me.”</p>
    <p>The world No. 4 did not drop a sin­gle game in five matches en route to the ti­tle at the pres­ti­gious US$750,000 (S$1.02 mil­lion) Su­per 750 tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>The event marked the re­sump­tion of the BWF World Tour sea­son fol­low­ing a seven-month shut­down due to the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Marin was dom­i­nant in their last meet­ing, win­ning their In­done­sia Masters round-of-16 clash in Jan­uary 21-13, 21-15 to take a 9-7 headto-head lead into the show­down.</p>
    <p>A re­peat looked on the cards when the three-time world cham­pion went up 5-3 but she never led again in the open­ing game af­ter Okuhara drew level at 5-5.</p>
    <p>It was a sim­i­lar story in the sec­ond game, when Marin held a 2-0 ad­van­tage. But Okuhara won the next three points and never looked back. The 25-year-old sealed the win in the bat­tle be­tween two for­mer top-ranked stars af­ter 56 min­utes with a rare smash win­ner.</p>
    <p>Vic­tory over the Spa­niard at the Odense Sports Park ended her los­ing run in fi­nals, hav­ing fin­ished run­ner-up the last six times.</p>
    <p>That streak in­cluded last year’s loss to Tai Tzu-ying here. She also fell to the Tai­wanese star at last year’s Sin­ga­pore Open ti­tle de­cider.</p>
    <p>World No. 6 Marin said her in­con­sis­tency cost her.</p>
    <p>“I think the main rea­son was the mis­takes I made. I made all the win­ners but also all the er­rors. The game was on me,” said the 27-yearold. “It was frus­trat­ing. I knew dur­ing the game that I was giv­ing her all the points. I tried to keep calm but today wasn’t my day. I couldn’t come back.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Okuhara’s com­pa­tri­ots fought it out i n an all-Ja­pan women’s dou­bles fi­nal. Yuki Fukushima and Sayaka Hirota beat Mayu Mat­sumoto and Wakana Na­ga­hara 21-10, 16-21, 21-18.</p>
    <p>English duo Mar­cus El­lis and Chris Lan­gridge won the men’s dou­bles ti­tle, de­feat­ing Rus­sian pair Vladimir Ivanov and Ivan So­zonov 20-22, 21-17, 21-18.</p>
    <p>An­ders An­ton­sen, sil­ver medal­list at last year’s world cham­pi­onships, claimed the men’s sin­gles ti­tle with a 18-21, 21-19, 21-12 win over com­pa­triot Ras­mus Gemke.</p>
    <p>I’m happy! Long time no ti­tle! Com­pared to other op­po­nents, Marin is faster and has a harder at­tack. I was fo­cused on de­fence and foot­work, and my feet moved very well today. Over­all the match went well for me.</p>
