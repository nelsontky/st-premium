    <p>More help is avail­able for Sin­ga­pore­ans who face dif­fi­cul­ties get­ting enough food amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>One ini­tia­tive is a vend­ing ma­chine at Block 813A Choa Chu Kang Av­enue 7 that dis­penses dry food items and bento meals for needy res­i­dents, in­clud­ing se­niors with mo­bil­ity is­sues.</p>
    <p>Every month, 200 of th­ese res­i­dents are each given a card con­tain­ing $50 in credit, which they can tap at the ma­chine to re­deem dry food items, in­clud­ing canned food and rice. They can also re­deem ready-made packed meals.</p>
    <p>The vend­ing ma­chine of­fers packed meals for $3 and other food items at prices rang­ing from $1 to $7. Th­ese items in­clude pack­ets of Milo pow­der, bis­cuits, condi­ments and in­stant noo­dles.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive, which will run un­til the end of next year, is sup­ported by non-profit group The Food Bank Sin­ga­pore as well as var­i­ous grass­roots and so­cial ser­vice or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Roziana Ramli, 39, a ben­e­fi­ciary, said she is ap­pre­cia­tive of the ini­tia­tive as it helps her save money as well as time from hav­ing to buy food from a far­ther place.</p>
    <p>“There are many choices avail­able and it is also easy for me to heat up the meals in the mi­crowave pro­vided,” she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Low Yen Ling, Mayor of South West Dis­trict and an MP for Chua Chu Kang GRC, said: “De­spite the chal­lenges posed by Covid-19, we are see­ing uni­fied ef­forts by or­gan­i­sa­tions and in­di­vid­u­als from all fronts com­ing to­gether to help the vul­ner­a­ble. We wel­come in­no­va­tions like the Food Bank vend­ing ma­chine which ex­tend our reach and re­sources.”</p>
    <p>Separately, The Food Bank has teamed up with Dairy Farm Group – which owns the Giant and Cold Stor­age su­per­mar­kets – to or­gan­ise a food do­na­tion drive.</p>
    <p>The drive aims to pro­vide un­der­priv­i­leged fam­i­lies with food prod­ucts such as brown rice, oat crack­ers and low-sugar ce­re­als.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic can do­nate dry goods, canned goods, sauces and bev­er­ages at col­lec­tion points in par­tic­i­pat­ing su­per­mar­ket out­lets.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive be­gan yes­ter­day at 10 Cold Stor­age and Giant out­lets, and there are plans for it to be rolled out is­land­wide over the next few months.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that this year has been chal­leng­ing for many fam­i­lies, Mr Chris Bush, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Dairy Farm’s South-east Asia food busi­ness, said: “With stores lo­cated is­land­wide pro­vid­ing easy ac­cess to prod­ucts and col­lec­tion points, we are hop­ing to make it eas­ier for cus­tomers to par­tic­i­pate (in the ini­tia­tive) so that we can make an even big­ger im­pact for fam­i­lies in need.”</p>
    <p>Ms Nichol Ng, co-founder of The Food Bank Sin­ga­pore, said house­holds fac­ing food in­se­cu­rity of­ten pri­ori­tise af­ford­abil­ity over the nu­tri­tional value of food. “We are proud to part­ner Dairy Farm to in­crease the aware­ness of food in­se­cu­rity so that we might nar­row the gap on food sup­port to feed Sin­ga­pore bet­ter to­gether,” she said.</p>
