    <p>The ju­di­cial man­agers (JMs)of in­sol­vent marine fu­els sup­plier In­ter-Pa­cific Petroleum (IPP) have sued the com­pany’s for­mer di­rec­tor Goh Jin Hian over US$156 mil­lion (S$212.6 mil­lion) in losses it sus­tained due to his al­leged breach of di­rec­tor’s du­ties, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments seen by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>The suit against Dr Goh – the son of for­mer prime min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong – was filed late last Fri­day night in Sin­ga­pore’s High Court by LVM Law Cham­bers, which rep­re­sents Deloitte & Touche, IPP’s JMs.</p>
    <p>It is be­ing funded by IPP’s two largest cred­i­tors, Malayan Bank­ing and So­ci­ete Gen­erale’s Sin­ga­pore branch.</p>
    <p>The suit seeks to re­cover about US$156 mil­lion with in­ter­est from Dr Goh for draw­downs of trade fi­nanc­ing be­tween June and July last year to fund what the banks al­leged were “non-ex­is­tent or sham trans­ac­tions”.</p>
    <p>This con­sisted of US$146 mil­lion al­legedly drawn down for car­ry­ing out cargo trad­ing oper­a­tions and US$10.5 mil­lion drawn from SocGen’s fa­cil­ity for IPP’s bunker­ing oper­a­tions, the suit said.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh told ST yes­ter­day that he was “sur­prised that the ju­di­cial man­agers have com­menced an ac­tion so uni­lat­er­ally” with­out en­gag­ing him on the full side of his story.</p>
    <p>“I have raised var­i­ous queries and con­cerns to the JMs. How the banks could have let the debt build up to US$160 mil­lion when this was meant to be back-to-back fi­nanc­ing or very short-term loans? Have the JMs chal­lenged the bank’s en­ti­tle­ment to this pay­ment? What did the banks who are ex­perts in trade fi­nanc­ing miss that I should have picked up? What should I have done as a di­rec­tor that I did not do?”</p>
    <p>IPP and par­ent com­pany In­ter-Pa­cific Group filed for a court-led debt-re­struc­tur­ing process in Au­gust last year. They cited “a sig­nif­i­cant cash-flow crunch” fol­low­ing the sus­pen­sion of IPP’s bunker craft op­er­a­tor li­cence last year af­ter the Mar­itime and Port Authority of Sin­ga­pore de­tected op­er­a­tional ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties dur­ing an in­spec­tion.</p>
    <p>The li­cence was can­celled in Oc­to­ber last year and its bunker sup­plier li­cence ter­mi­nated shortly af­ter in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh, 52, was a di­rec­tor at IPP from June 28, 2011, to Aug 20 last year.</p>
    <p>The suit ac­cuses him of breach­ing his duty to act with due care, skill and dili­gence to en­sure IPP’s af­fairs were “prop­erly ad­min­is­tered and that its as­sets and prop­erty are not dis­si­pated”, among other things.</p>
    <p>It claims that had he done so, he would have “dis­cov­ered from the last quar­ter of 2017 that there were sig­nif­i­cant out­stand­ing ac­count­ing re­ceiv­ables pur­port­edly due and ow­ing from its cus­tomers, which were de­rived from trans­ac­tions which were in fact shams and nonex­is­tent”.</p>
    <p>IPP would buy oil from sup­pli­ers un­der sup­ply con­tracts and then on-sell to its cus­tomers un­der sales con­tracts. IPP would sub­mit the sales and sup­ply con­tracts to SocGen or May­bank in or­der to get trade fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Deloitte said that IPP’s books and other doc­u­ments show that there were out­stand­ing re­ceiv­ables of US$869 mil­lion pur­port­edly due to IPP as at Septem­ber last year by its fuel oil cus­tomers. About US$762.4 mil­lion of this was in­curred by Mer­cu­ria En­ergy Trad­ing.</p>
    <p>But when the JMs sought pay­ment, they found that many of these sales con­tracts were a sham and non-ex­is­tent. In fact, IPP was bal­ance-sheet in­sol­vent by around June last year, the suit said.</p>
    <p>It al­leges that Dr Goh “ought to have in­ves­ti­gated why there was such a high level... of out­stand­ing re­ceiv­ables due from Mer­cu­ria, ev­ery month start­ing from end-Septem­ber 2017... and why the re­ceiv­ables... with a credit term of only 60 days, re­mained un­col­lected as at June and July 2019”.</p>
    <p>Had he done so, he would have dis­cov­ered that the pur­ported re­ceiv­ables arose from mostly sham trans­ac­tions, the suit said.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, in fail­ing to pre­vent IPP from ap­ply­ing to SocGen and May­bank for draw­downs, at the time when IPP was in­sol­vent, Dr Goh al­legedly “acted in breach of his fidu­ciary duty to (IPP) to take into ac­count the in­ter­ests of (its) cred­i­tors to en­sure that IPP’s as­sets are not dis­si­pated or ex­ploited to the prej­u­dice of the cred­i­tors’ in­ter­ests”, it said.</p>
    <p>The suit ac­cuses Dr Goh Jin Hian – an In­ter-Pa­cific Petroleum (IPP) di­rec­tor from June 28, 2011, to Aug 20 last year – of breach­ing his duty to act with due care, skill and dili­gence to en­sure IPP’s af­fairs were “prop­erly ad­min­is­tered and that its as­sets and prop­erty are not dis­si­pated”, among other things.</p>
