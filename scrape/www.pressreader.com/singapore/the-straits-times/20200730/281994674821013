    <p>BOS­TON • US prosecutor­s have brought tax charges against a Har­vard Univer­sity pro­fes­sor ac­cused of ly­ing to the au­thor­i­ties about his ties to a China-run re­cruit­ment pro­gramme and fund­ing he al­legedly re­ceived from the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment for re­search.</p>
    <p>Charles Lieber, the for­mer chair of Har­vard’s chem­istry and chem­i­cal bi­ol­ogy de­part­ment, was charged in an in­dict­ment filed in fed­eral court in Bos­ton with fail­ing to re­port in­come he re­ceived from the Wuhan Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy in China.</p>
    <p>The case cen­tres on China’s Thou­sand Tal­ents Pro­gramme, which the United States au­thor­i­ties say China uses to en­tice overseas Chi­nese cit­i­zens and for­eign re­searchers to share their knowl­edge with China in ex­change for perks in­clud­ing re­search fund­ing. Prosecutor­s said Lieber in 2011 be­came a “strate­gic sci­en­tist” at Wuhan Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and later con­trac­tu­ally par­tic­i­pated in the Thou­sand Tal­ents Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Un­der his con­tract, Lieber was paid up to US$50,000 (S$68,800) a month and liv­ing ex­penses of up to US$158,000, prosecutor­s said. He was also awarded more than US$1.5 mil­lion to es­tab­lish a re­search lab, the prosecutor­s said.</p>
    <p>In ex­change, Lieber agreed to or­gan­ise in­ter­na­tional con­fer­ences, pub­lish ar­ti­cles and ap­ply for patents in the univer­sity’s name, prosecutor­s said.</p>
    <p>The four tax-re­lated counts are in ad­di­tion to two counts of mak­ing false state­ments to the fed­eral au­thor­i­ties that Lieber, 61, pleaded not guilty to last month.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, US fed­eral agen­cies are in­ves­ti­gat­ing sus­pi­cious and un­so­licited pack­ages of seeds that have been ar­riv­ing at ad­dresses across Amer­ica and ap­pear to come from China.</p>
    <p>Any­one who re­ceives the ship­ments should hold on to the seeds and pack­ag­ing and im­me­di­ately con­tact of­fi­cials, the US De­part­ment of Agri­cul­ture (USDA) said in a state­ment. The au­thor­i­ties in Canada also said there have been re­ports of its cit­i­zens re­ceiv­ing un­so­licited seed pack­ages, echo­ing the USDA’s warn­ing not to plant them.</p>
