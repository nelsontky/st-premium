    <p>The Na­tional Day Pa­rade (NDP) on Aug 9 has been de­clared an en­hanced se­cu­rity spe­cial event, said the po­lice yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The dec­la­ra­tion un­der the Pub­lic Or­der Act will des­ig­nate the ar­eas around the Padang and The Star Vista as spe­cial event ar­eas on Aug 9.</p>
    <p>These ar­eas will see strict se­cu­rity mea­sures im­posed on that day to en­sure pub­lic safety and se­cu­rity, said the po­lice in a state­ment. Spe­cial zones within these event ar­eas will also see stricter se­cu­rity checks.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­rity re­stric­tions at the Padang will start from 5am un­til 2pm on Aug 9, and from 3pm to 11.59pm at The Star Vista.</p>
    <p>Ow­ing to Covid-19 safety mea­sures, this year’s NDP has been scaled down and will be bro­ken down into two seg­ments, with a morn­ing pa­rade and cer­e­mony held at the Padang, and an evening show at The Star Vista.</p>
    <p>As part of se­cu­rity mea­sures, a list of items are pro­hib­ited within the spe­cial event area, in­clud­ing ex­plo­sives, loud­hail­ers and firearms. The po­lice will con­duct checks on mem­bers of the pub­lic for such items within these ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Un­manned aerial ve­hi­cles (UAVs), in­clud­ing drones, are also strictly pro­hib­ited within the spe­cial event area.</p>
    <p>It is an of­fence to take or fly UAVs into the area with­out a valid per­mit.</p>
    <p>Those who pos­sess pro­hib­ited items within the spe­cial event area or fly a UAV il­le­gally may face a jail term of up to 12 months, a fine of up to $20,000, or both. The pro­hib­ited items or UAV will be seized.</p>
    <p>In view of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, the po­lice will gen­er­ally not be grant­ing per­mits for any in­door or outdoor pub­lic as­sem­blies or pro­ces­sions within the spe­cial event ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The po­lice may con­duct se­cu­rity checks and screen­ing on all per­sons and ve­hi­cles en­ter­ing and within the spe­cial zone. They can also refuse en­try to or re­move a per­son from the area if nec­es­sary.</p>
