    <p>BANGKOK • Thai­land’s King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn has sworn in a new Cabi­net, and called for “or­der and peace” but with­out men­tion­ing re­cent anti-gov­ern­ment stu­dent protests that have urged re­forms of the pow­er­ful monar­chy.</p>
    <p>The swear­ing-in cer­e­mony on Wed­nes­day marked the monarch’s first pub­lic ap­pear­ance since the nearly un­prece­dented calls in two stu­dent-led protests for curb­ing the new pow­ers that King Va­ji­ra­longkorn has amassed since tak­ing the throne after the death of his fa­ther in 2016.</p>
    <p>The King, as head of state, gave his bless­ing to the new Cabi­net mem­bers, wish­ing them “good health and wis­dom to have the strength to per­form your du­ties ac­cord­ing to your oaths”.</p>
    <p>He also ex­pressed a de­sire “for the hap­pi­ness of the peo­ple, hap­pi­ness of the pub­lic and for or­der and peace”.</p>
    <p>He did not pub­licly ac­knowl­edge the stu­dent protests, some of which de­fied lese ma­jeste laws against in­sult­ing the monar­chy that carry a max­i­mum 15-year prison sen­tence.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-ocha had said on Tues­day that thou­sands of stu­dent pro­test­ers “went too far” after some is­sued a 10-point call for re­form of the monar­chy, which is con­sid­ered semi-di­vine in the coun­try’s con­ser­va­tive cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Yesterday, Mr Prayut said he plans to or­der an in­ves­ti­ga­tion to iden­tify the peo­ple be­hind the protests, even as he promised to re­solve the ten­sion peace­fully.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at a me­dia brief­ing after a Cabi­net meet­ing, Mr Prayut pleaded with pro­test­ers not to use demon­stra­tions as a plat­form to stir un­rest and said the gov­ern­ment “is be­ing very care­ful” not to in­flame the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“The ma­jor­ity of peo­ple don’t agree with this,” he said. “We have to look into the demon­stra­tions and who’s be­hind it be­cause there’s a lot of money in­volved. We have to in­ves­ti­gate.”</p>
    <p>So far, no protest lead­ers have been charged un­der the lese ma­jeste laws but two key lead­ers were ar­rested on charges in­clud­ing sedi­tion and vi­o­lat­ing coro­n­avirus reg­u­la­tions on large gath­er­ings be­fore be­ing re­leased on bail.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Dig­i­tal Econ­omy Min­is­ter Bud­dhipongse Pun­nakanta or­dered the au­thor­i­ties to iden­tify “in­ap­pro­pri­ate” posts and sin­gled out 114 posts mostly made on Face­book, but also Twit­ter and YouTube, that may be in breach of the Com­puter Crimes Act.</p>
    <p>“All ev­i­dence will be gath­ered and sub­mit­ted to court to­mor­row,” he wrote on Face­book late on Tues­day. “Once the court has is­sued an or­der, it will be for­warded to the three plat­forms. If within 15 days, the ac­counts are not closed or posts deleted, we’ll im­me­di­ately take le­gal ac­tion.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the law, fines for vi­o­la­tions are a max­i­mum of 200,000 baht (S$8,840) and a daily fine of no more than 5,000 baht per post, he wrote.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of de­mon­stra­tors had gath­ered on Mon­day as part of near-daily ral­lies which have gained mo­men­tum after the ar­rests of top lead­ers.</p>
    <p>They re­it­er­ated a rare pub­lic call last week by one of those ar­rested, Mr Arnon Nampa, for rolling back mea­sures that in­creased the power of King Va­ji­ra­longkorn.</p>
