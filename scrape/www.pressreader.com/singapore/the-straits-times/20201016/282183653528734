    <p>With the re­cov­ery from the depths of its worst re­ces­sion still in its early days, Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy is right now like a glass half-full.</p>
    <p>For the pes­simist it rep­re­sents a job half done. The op­ti­mist will point to the up­per half that flags op­por­tu­ni­ties yet to be grabbed.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is a grow­ing con­sen­sus that fill­ing the empty half – tak­ing the econ­omy back to where it was be­fore the coro­n­avirus struck – will be a bit more chal­leng­ing and may need more time and pa­tience than ear­lier per­ceived.</p>
    <p>The lat­est set of eco­nomic data shows progress has been made and the worst is prob­a­bly be­hind us.</p>
    <p>Ad­vance es­ti­mates from the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) this week showed that the econ­omy shrank 7 per cent in the July-Septem­ber pe­riod – well un­der the his­toric plunge of 13.3 per cent year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>But the growth mo­men­tum in the third quar­ter was mostly pow­ered by the re­sump­tion in eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties after cir­cuit breaker mea­sures were re­laxed.</p>
    <p>As mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions are fur­ther eased, the econ­omy may shrink even less in the Oc­to­ber-De­cem­ber quar­ter.</p>
    <p>The data next year will start to turn pos­i­tive, but mainly be­cause of the low base ef­fect.</p>
    <p>For next year, the com­par­a­tive pe­riod will be this one, which will be re­mem­bered as the worst year in Sin­ga­pore’s his­tory – as the econ­omy will con­tract by 5 per cent to 7 per cent, ac­cord­ing to an MTI fore­cast.</p>
    <p>But even as growth heads into pos­i­tive ter­ri­tory, the un­der­ly­ing mo­men­tum will re­main mod­est through next year.</p>
    <p>For starters, the rea­son for the global eco­nomic col­lapse is still alive and kick­ing.</p>
    <p>The sud­den out­breaks across the globe are re­minders that the fa­tal disease is still lurk­ing around.</p>
    <p>Even as sev­eral phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms are close to a break­through on a vac­cine, hopes that a cure will be avail­able quickly enough across the world are fad­ing.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tainty on the course of the pan­demic alone can keep a size­able part of the econ­omy – from avi­a­tion to hospitalit­y to re­tail and food out­lets – at least par­tially shut.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion will con­tinue to suf­fer be­cause of project de­lays and an over­all drop in de­mand for new build­ings.</p>
    <p>The Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity last month re­vised its pro­jected con­struc­tion de­mand to be­tween $18 bil­lion and $23 bil­lion for the year, down from its Jan­uary fore­cast of $28 bil­lion to $33 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Like most de­vel­oped economies, busi­nesses that pro­vide ser­vices ac­count for nearly 70 per cent of the econ­omy and nearly as many jobs.</p>
    <p>If the ser­vice sec­tor bleeds, more job losses are likely and new ones will be hard to come by.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment stood at 4.5 per cent in Au­gust, ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Man­power.</p>
    <p>Ris­ing un­em­ploy­ment eats into the num­ber of con­sumers chas­ing not just ser­vices, but goods as well.</p>
    <p>Weak de­mand from end con­sumers even­tu­ally hits man­u­fac­tur­ers, whether they are mak­ing fin­ished goods or parts.</p>
    <p>Con­sumer de­mand and labour market con­di­tions are frag­ile, not just in Sin­ga­pore, but world­wide.</p>
    <p>That is bad news for the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor in Sin­ga­pore, which is al­most en­tirely de­pen­dent on ex­ter­nal de­mand.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the never-end­ing United States-China trade con­flict is another guess­ing game for man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>Wor­ries over tar­iffs and sanc­tions and their dis­rup­tive im­pact on sup­ply chains can de­lay de­ci­sions on new in­vest­ments, projects and con­tracts – trans­lat­ing into weak busi­ness sen­ti­ments.</p>
    <p>The US State Depart­ment warned on Wed­nes­day against deal­ing with in­di­vid­u­als deemed re­spon­si­ble for “erod­ing the free­doms of Hong Kongers”, start­ing the clock for a 60-day count­down be­fore black­list­ing fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Sim­ply put, ten­sions in US-China re­la­tions will con­tinue to weigh on the global growth out­look.</p>
    <p>There are no of­fi­cial es­ti­mates for next year, but most pri­vate sec­tor an­a­lysts be­lieve Sin­ga­pore can achieve growth of 5 per cent to 6 per cent.</p>
    <p>The MTI gave no com­men­tary on the out­look when it is­sued its es­ti­mates for the third quar­ter.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the Mone­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) said core in­fla­tion, which ex­cludes the costs of ac­com­mo­da­tion and pri­vate road trans­port, will turn mildly pos­i­tive next year.</p>
    <p>It said core in­fla­tion will av­er­age 0 per cent to 1 per cent next year, after av­er­ag­ing be­tween mi­nus 0.5 per cent and 0 per cent in this one.</p>
    <p>A fore­cast for in­fla­tion to re­main low sug­gests the cen­tral bank be­lieves de­mand con­di­tions will not im­prove much next year.</p>
    <p>“The ini­tial uptick in con­sumer-fac­ing ser­vices is likely to fade given soft labour market con­di­tions and lin­ger­ing pub­lic health con­cerns, while the in­dus­tries that did well in 2020, such as phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, could also mod­er­ate in the year ahead,” MAS said in its lat­est pol­icy state­ment.</p>
    <p>For Mr Irvin Seah, se­nior econ­o­mist at DBS Bank, the third-quar­ter data and MAS’ comments back his ex­pec­ta­tion for an “ar­du­ous and long re­cov­ery process”.</p>
    <p>He said the cur­rent bust to boom cy­cle is ex­pected to be rel­a­tively longer com­pared with the past two re­ces­sions, and the econ­omy may take as long as 24 months for its real gross do­mes­tic prod­uct to re­turn to the level it was at be­fore the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>As mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions are fur­ther eased, the econ­omy may shrink even less in the Oc­to­ber-De­cem­ber quar­ter. The data next year will start to turn pos­i­tive, but mainly be­cause of the low base ef­fect.</p>
