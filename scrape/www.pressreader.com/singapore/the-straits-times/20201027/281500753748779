    <p>The po­lit­i­cal storm that had threat­ened to de­rail the Malaysian gov­ern­ment re­ceded some­what early this morn­ing af­ter the Umno lead­er­ship de­cided to con­tinue ex­tend­ing its sup­port to the Perikatan Na­sional (PN) ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion came af­ter a marathon meet­ing of the Umno Supreme Coun­cil that stretched past mid­night and a day of high drama in the course of which there were mixed sig­nals, in­clud­ing sug­ges­tions that Umno might seek to re­place em­bat­tled Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din him­self had con­tem­plated re­sign­ing over a royal re­buff to his re­quest for emer­gency pow­ers, The Straits Times has learnt.</p>
    <p>The King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, had de­creed that politi­cians not threaten the sta­bil­ity of the Muhyid­din gov­ern­ment and let it get on with tack­ling the resur­gent coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A change of gov­ern­ment ap­peared very much on the cards, with marathon meet­ings through the day, un­til the Umno Supreme Coun­cil an­nounced af­ter mid­night that the party’s MPs would con­tinue to sup­port the PN gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>The state­ment did not ex­plic­itly back Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>“Umno calls for im­prove­ments in the prin­ci­ples of co­op­er­a­tion that must be cen­tred on the val­ues of re­spect and po­lit­i­cal con­sen­sus,” said the state­ment is­sued by party pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi.</p>
    <p>Be­fore this, ST had learnt that Mr Muhyid­din had con­sid­ered re­sign­ing on Sun­day night af­ter his pro­posal was re­buffed by the King, but close al­lies per­suaded him to stay on un­til a so­lu­tion could be found.</p>
    <p>“Muhyid­din was shaken by the King’s re­jec­tion, but he does not want to fol­low in the foot­steps of Ma­hathir,” a source said, re­fer­ring to how for­mer premier Ma­hathir</p>
    <p>Mo­hamad’s res­ig­na­tion left Malaysia in po­lit­i­cal chaos for a week be­fore Mr Muhyid­din was sworn in on March 1.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter met party chiefs from his PN pact early yes­ter­day, but a no­table ab­sen­tee was Zahid, who has in re­cent weeks threat­ened to with­draw his party’s sup­port for Mr Muhyid­din.</p>
    <p>The Prime Min­is­ter then chaired a spe­cial Cabi­net meet­ing at 11.30am while Zahid, who had skipped the PN meet, say­ing he was un­well, later chaired a meet­ing of the Umno-led Barisan Na­sional coali­tion’s 43 MPs in the af­ter­noon af­ter its min­is­ters ar­rived at the Umno head­quar­ters fol­low­ing the Cabi­net meet­ing.</p>
    <p>Asked if Mr Muhyid­din’s res­ig­na­tion was on the agenda, For­eign Min­is­ter Hisham­mud­din Hus­sein said: “That is what we are dis­cussing... We dis­cussed how to move for­ward.”</p>
    <p>For­mer premier Na­jib Razak said on Face­book that he pro­posed that Umno back op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim and his Pakatan Hara­pan pact, but it must ex­clude the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Coun­cil, Umno’s top de­ci­sion-mak­ing body, said it had re­jected this pro­posal. It had met from about 8.30pm, im­me­di­ately af­ter an evening con­fer­ence of the party’s state chiefs. The meet­ing ended just af­ter mid­night.</p>
    <p>The plan to call an emer­gency was os­ten­si­bly to al­low the gov­ern­ment to tackle the pan­demic with­out po­lit­i­cal dis­trac­tions but crit­ics dis­missed it as a ploy by Mr Muhyid­din to stay in power, given that the Prime Min­is­ter’s ra­zor-thin ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment will be tested when MPs meet to vote on the na­tional bud­get next month.</p>
    <p>An emer­gency would have al­lowed Par­lia­ment to be sus­pended ahead of the cru­cial Bud­get 2021 vote next month.</p>
    <p>Now that the King has re­jected Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s plan to im­pose emer­gency rule in Malaysia, the Premier might have to reach for sup­port from across the aisle to en­sure that his ad­min­is­tra­tion’s bud­get does not fail on the floor of Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Perikatan Na­sional (PN) coali­tion has a slim ma­jor­ity in the Lower House, and may need con­fi­dence and sup­ply agree­ments with its po­lit­i­cal ri­vals to bol­ster its chances.</p>
    <p>“Muhyid­din would have to rely heav­ily on the King’s call for unity and ces­sa­tion of ‘pol­i­tick­ing’ in his in­creas­ingly ar­du­ous ef­fort to per­suade both the op­po­si­tion as well as his rul­ing com­po­nent par­ties to en­ter into such agree­ments,” said Dr Oh Ei Sun, a se­nior fel­low at the Sin­ga­pore Institute of In­ter­na­tional Af­fairs.</p>
    <p>Dr Oh said Mr Muhyid­din squan­dered his po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal in try­ing to push through an emer­gency law, which was met with al­most broad crit­i­cism from both sides of the po­lit­i­cal di­vide as well as civil so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>“It re­mains to be seen to what ex­tent his po­lit­i­cal ri­vals would be con­vinced that this is in­deed the most vi­able po­lit­i­cal way for­ward,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din’s pro­posal for emer­gency mea­sures, which was re­jected by the King, Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah Ah­mad Shah, on Sun­day, would have al­lowed him to ap­prove gov­ern­ment ex­pen­di­ture for next year with­out un­der­go­ing par­lia­men­tary scrutiny. It would also have avoided the need to hold an elec­tion dur­ing the coron­avirus pan­demic in the event he failed to prove his ma­jor­ity in the Lower House.</p>
    <p>In­stead, his failed plan sparked calls for him to va­cate his of­fice. Umno, the big­gest party in Mr Muhyid­din’s rul­ing pact, and the Barisan Na­sional coali­tion ad­mit­ted they had dis­cussed ask­ing the Prime Min­is­ter to re­sign dur­ing a series of meet­ings yes­ter­day. One of Umno’s lead­ers, Datuk Puad Zarkashi, had even openly called for Mr Muhyid­din to step down.</p>
    <p>This was not helped by op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim claim­ing a fort­night ago, dur­ing an au­di­ence with the King, that he had the sup­port of a par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity to form a new gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Spec­u­la­tion was rife then that he was backed by Umno MPs.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in the early hours to­day, the Umno Supreme Coun­cil de­cided it would con­tinue back­ing Mr Muhyid­din’s PN ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>While this af­fords the Prime Min­is­ter some breath­ing space, PN still con­trols only 113 MPs in the 222-strong Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>De­spite the chal­lenges at hand, there have been indi­ca­tions from both sides of the po­lit­i­cal di­vide that a form of bi­par­ti­san con­sen­sus to pass the bud­get may be pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Umno Youth chief Asyraf Wa­jdi Dusuki yes­ter­day called on the gov­ern­ment to estab­lish a spe­cial com­mit­tee in­volv­ing both the gov­ern­ment and the op­po­si­tion in com­bat­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>He also urged pe­ri­odic bi­par­ti­san en­gage­ment to be es­tab­lished to tackle the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“The Prime Min­is­ter has to call lead­ers of all par­ties – gov­ern­ment or op­po­si­tion – to have a pre-Par­lia­ment con­sul­ta­tion to en­sure that Bud­get 2021 is passed for the wel­fare of the peo­ple,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party or­gan­is­ing sec­re­tary An­thony Loke, a for­mer fed­eral Cabi­net min­is­ter, sim­i­larly called for a “na­tional con­sen­sus” to pass the up­com­ing na­tional bud­get.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion MP urged all par­ties not to “take ad­van­tage” of the King’s re­jec­tion of Mr Muhyid­din’s emer­gency plans, and in­stead unite to over­come Covid-19 in­fec­tions in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>He also called on all par­ties to agree that a gen­eral elec­tion would not be held un­til 2023, when an elec­tion is ac­tu­ally due.</p>
    <p>“It is time for po­lit­i­cal lead­ers to heed His Majesty’s ad­vice and reach a na­tional con­sen­sus,” Mr Loke said in a state­ment on Sun­day.</p>

The Prime Min&#xAD;is&#xAD;ter then chaired a spe&#xAD;cial Cabi&#xAD;net meet&#xAD;ing amid spec&#xAD;u&#xAD;la&#xAD;tion that Zahid was ready to make good on the threat he had back&#xAD;tracked on just last week.</p>
