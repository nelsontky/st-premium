    <p>TURIN (Italy) • Ju­ven­tus need just four more points from their four re­main­ing games to clinch a recordex­tend­ing ninth con­sec­u­tive Serie A ti­tle.</p>
    <p>With one loss and two draws from eight games, the Ital­ian side have not been at their im­pe­ri­ous best since last month’s restart, but their league ri­vals have fal­tered too. One player has, how­ever, main­tained his form.</p>
    <p>Cris­tiano Ron­aldo scored twice in a 2-1 win over fourth-placed Lazio on Mon­day to be­come the first player to hit 50 goals in Serie A, La Liga and the Premier League.</p>
    <p>Ju­ven­tus ended a three-match win­less run thanks to his sec­ond­half brace that moved them eight points clear of sec­ond-placed In­ter Mi­lan (72).</p>
    <p>Mau­r­izio Sarri’s side can win the ti­tle against lowly Udi­nese to­mor­row, or on Sun­day at home against Sam­p­do­ria, de­pend­ing on how their ri­vals fare, lead­ing the Ju­ven­tus coach to pay trib­ute to his star for­ward.</p>
    <p>“When Cris­tiano smells blood… He’s ex­tra­or­di­nary, as he re­cov­ers so quickly be­tween games,” the former Chelsea boss told Sky Sport Italia.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just phys­i­cal, but psy­cho­log­i­cal. He could be some­one who uses up so much en­ergy in each game, but he re­cov­ers it ev­ery time and he’s world class in the mind as well as the legs.</p>
    <p>“We are miss­ing four points, only af­ter we have achieved them will we then be able to think about the goal achieved.</p>
    <p>“All the games are dif­fi­cult now, and in the space of six days, we play three games. So, we must stay fo­cused and think about se­cur­ing the miss­ing points.”</p>
    <p>Ron­aldo has scored 30 goals this sea­son, along­side Lazio’s Ciro Im­mo­bile, who ended his three­match drought with a late penalty.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing missed out on the top scorer award last sea­son in his de­but sea­son in Ital­ian foot­ball, the Portugal captain is ea­ger to claim that prize this time.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing won the Golden Boot in the English Premier League and the Span­ish La Liga, he can be­come the first player to fin­ish top scorer in three of the top five Euro­pean leagues. But the 35-year-old first wants to seal the Scud­etto.</p>
    <p>“Records are al­ways im­por­tant, but the team vic­tory is more im­por­tant,” said the former Manch­ester United and Real Madrid star. “There are four games left and we know that Serie A is a dif­fi­cult cham­pi­onship.”</p>
