    <p>KEEP ON GO­ING</p>
    <p>They have to con­tinue that good work on their side, maybe every now and then ask a coach to film them or put a cam­era un­der­wa­ter and just stay ’’ in touch with us.</p>
    <p>STEPHAN WID­MER, na­tional swim­ming head coach and per­for­mance di­rec­tor, on how he wants to keep up with the US-based swim­mers’ progress.</p>
    <p>BACK TO THE REAL THING</p>
    <p>When you’re go­ing out fast, you want to be able to come home fast as well – that’s the next ’’ step of train­ing.</p>
    <p>WID­MER, on the swim­mers’ fo­cus switch­ing to race-spe­cific train­ing.</p>
    <p>Four months af­ter the Covid-19 pan­demic forced Olympic-bound Quah Zheng Wen and his younger sis­ter Jing Wen to re­turn home to train with the na­tional squad, the duo de­parted for the United States on Sun­day to re­sume train­ing over­seas.</p>
    <p>Two-time Olympian Zheng Wen, 23, and Jing Wen, 19, are un­der­grad­u­ates at the Univer­sity of Cal­i­for­nia, Berke­ley and Texas A&M Univer­sity re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>In April, the sib­lings flew home and re­joined sis­ter Ting Wen, 27, for train­ing at the OCBC Aquatic Cen­tre as strict re­stric­tions were im­ple­mented in both states ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus. They con­tin­ued to at­tend univer­sity classes on­line.</p>
    <p>While sports venues here were closed dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod from April 7 to June 1, train­ing re­sumed on June 2 for about 30 ath­letes who had qual­i­fied or were close to qual­i­fy­ing for the Tokyo Olympics and Par­a­lympics, which have been post­poned to next year.</p>
    <p>Na­tional swim­ming head coach and per­for­mance di­rec­tor Stephan Wid­mer noted that the sib­lings had made good progress while train­ing here, stress­ing that they would need to be dis­ci­plined in the US.</p>
    <p>“While they were here they gave it ev­ery­thing and trained hard, that’s a real great strength of theirs and I was sorry to see them go.</p>
    <p>“Now it’s about trans­lat­ing that great at­ti­tude to great skill. I be­lieve they’re in a good po­si­tion,” Wid­mer told The Straits Times, adding that the pair have im­proved in fit­ness and stroke ef­fi­ciency.</p>
    <p>“They have to con­tinue that good work on their side, maybe every now and then ask a coach to film them or put a cam­era un­der­wa­ter and just stay in touch with us.</p>
    <p>“What we want most for them is that they stay well and safe – that is one of the high­est pri­or­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>Texas A&M starts its fall se­mes­ter on Aug 19 while UC Berke­ley is re­sum­ing the school term on Aug 26 with fully re­mote in­struc­tion, though the univer­sity is still pre­par­ing to im­ple­ment hy­brid or flex­i­ble modes.</p>
    <p>The Quahs are not the only na­tional ath­letes re­turn­ing to the US to train.</p>
    <p>Fencer Amita Berthier, an un­der­grad­u­ate at the Univer­sity of Notre Dame, is go­ing back on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Olympic swim­ming cham­pion Joseph School­ing had been pre­par­ing for his Games ti­tle de­fence in</p>
    <p>Vir­ginia with his for­mer coach Ser­gio Lopez, but will con­tinue train­ing here and is mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion in the US be­fore mak­ing a de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old said: “I will be head­ing back to the US to train once the con­di­tions and sit­u­a­tion is deemed stable for me to do so. There is no set time­line.</p>
    <p>“My fo­cus now is to ap­pre­ci­ate the time I’ve been given to con­tinue to im­prove and to get stronger and bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 has wreaked havoc on the lo­cal and in­ter­na­tional sport­ing cal­en­dar, Olympic swim­ming hope­fuls in Sin­ga­pore are still work­ing to­wards meet­ing the ‘A’ qual­i­fy­ing times for the Tokyo Games.</p>
    <p>They in­clude two-time Olympian Ting Wen, whose na­tional records in the 50m (24.92sec) and 100m freestyle (54.62sec) are off the</p>
    <p>Olympic A qual­i­fy­ing times (24.77sec, 54.38sec) and men’s 100m and 200m freestyle SEA Games cham­pion Dar­ren Chua.</p>
    <p>The next lo­cal qual­i­fy­ing meet is the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Swim­ming Age Group Cham­pi­onships, which are sched­uled to take place next March.</p>
    <p>Swim­mers could also com­pete in mi­nor time tri­als or e-com­pe­ti­tions over the next few months as part of the planned com­pe­ti­tion sim­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Wid­mer feels the swim­mers have re­gained their speed and skill level af­ter a virus-en­forced hia­tus, and are now fo­cus­ing on race-spe­cific train­ing.</p>
    <p>He added: “When you’re go­ing out fast, you want to be able to come home fast as well – that’s the next step of train­ing.”</p>
