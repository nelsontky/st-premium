    <p>The beauty in­flu­encer world can some­times ap­pear su­per­fi­cial, but there is an al­ter­na­tive group fast gain­ing trac­tion, and their style is more white coat than de­signer jacket. Iden­ti­fy­ing them­selves more as der­ma­tol­o­gists, cos­metic for­mu­la­tors and ed­u­ca­tors, they boast highly spe­cialised knowl­edge about the tech­ni­cal side of the beauty business – and they want to share it.</p>
    <p>The beauty in­flu­encer world can some­times ap­pear shal­low and su­per­fi­cial – pretty faces with not much to of­fer, some say – but there is an al­ter­na­tive group fast gain­ing trac­tion and their style is more white coat than de­signer jacket.</p>
    <p>Iden­ti­fy­ing them­selves more as der­ma­tol­o­gists, cos­metic for­mu­la­tors and ed­u­ca­tors than selfie-snap­ping, TikTok-danc­ing beauty fiends, they boast im­pres­sive qual­i­fi­ca­tions, highly spe­cialised knowl­edge and an in­sa­tiable cu­rios­ity even about the tech­ni­cal side of the beauty business – and they want to share it.</p>
    <p>Dr Michelle Wong, a Syd­ney­based PhD chemist and sci­ence ed­u­ca­tor, started blog­ging al­most a decade ago when she re­alised that there was a dearth of re­li­able in­for­ma­tion about beauty prod­ucts – and a whole lot of mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>She says things re­ally started to ex­plode though three to four years ago at the start of the so-called skin­tel­lec­tual trend, when brands like De­ciem came on the scene and be­gan to speak overtly about the in­gre­di­ents in their prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“The fact that chem­i­cal names were front and cen­tre in mar­ket­ing led peo­ple to won­der what they were. Be­cause they were so ac­ces­si­bly priced, peo­ple be­came more cu­ri­ous,” Dr Wong ex­plains.</p>
    <p>There was also the rise of the clean beauty move­ment with – as Ms Erica Dou­glas, the Amer­i­can cos­metic chemist known as Sis­ter Scientist on In­sta­gram, puts it – “peo­ple want­ing to know what they’re putting on and in their bod­ies”.</p>
    <p>En­ter in­flu­encers who aim to help con­sumers sort myths from facts so that they can make in­formed choices about what they buy.</p>
    <p>Mostly their fo­cus is on education, not sell­ing prod­ucts or their per­sonal brands.</p>
    <p>“It feels or­ganic. With tra­di­tional in­flu­encers, it’s not that they’re try­ing to trick peo­ple, but they are try­ing to con­vince peo­ple to fol­low them,” says Dr Aegean Chan, a USbased der­ma­tol­o­gist who doles out skin­care tips and truths via hu­mor­ous memes and vlog-style videos on her name­sake In­sta­gram ac­count.</p>
    <p>“We are just in­ter­ested in shar­ing knowl­edge. It seems – I don’t want to say pure – but it does feel like that.”</p>
    <p>Point­ing out that one of her bug­bears is the idea that com­mer­cial beauty prod­ucts are toxic, she adds that it is her way of re­spond­ing to mis­in­for­ma­tion – “when peo­ple try to sell things based on myths or scar­ing cus­tomers” – and of­fer­ing her knowl­edge on a plat­form ac­ces­si­ble to all.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple maybe haven’t thought of vis­it­ing a der­ma­tol­o­gist or don’t have one,” she elab­o­rates.</p>
    <p>“There is a void for sci­en­tific and com­mon-sense in­for­ma­tion about skin­care and a lot of spon­sored reviews that don’t fo­cus on how to take care of your skin based on bi­ol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“It’s nice to be a source of in­for­ma­tion, high­light­ing dis­eases that aren’t talked about that may be iso­lat­ing and help­ing to ed­u­cate peo­ple and maybe make them feel less alone.”</p>
    <p>For Ms Dou­glas, it is also about in­spir­ing young women through some­thing that they love and use daily: beauty prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“I want to be a rep­re­sen­ta­tive of what the new woman scientist looks like – get rid of the stereo­types and change the nar­ra­tives,” she says.</p>
    <p>“I’m show­ing peo­ple that sci­ence is a su­per­power to break down the prob­lems of ev­ery­day life.”</p>
    <p>Sci­ence-based in­flu­encers do not just come from the beauty world though. Nowa­days there are ex­perts in ev­ery­thing from women’s health to epi­demi­ol­ogy shar­ing their wis­dom on dif­fer­ent plat­forms.</p>
    <p>And with the Covid-19 pan­demic lead­ing to a greater i nter­est in sci­ence in gen­eral, these ac­ci­den­tal beauty in­flu­encers have found their fol­lower counts go­ing up.</p>
    <p>“It’s ex­posed the need for true ex­perts and we’re also see­ing what hap­pens when we deny and look past sci­ence,” says Ms Dou­glas. “There’s this yearn­ing for peo­ple to be in­formed and a need or de­sire for a deeper un­der­stand­ing of things and how sci­ence af­fects your ev­ery­day life.”</p>
    <p>The com­mu­nity is a sup­port­ive one and Dr Chan says she and her fel­low so­cial-me­dia-friendly sci­en­tists share knowl­edge with one an­other.</p>
    <p>They also re­post one an­other’s con­tent to spread the word fur­ther and make it a must to en­gage with their fol­low­ers, who of­ten see them as trusted and im­par­tial guides to the beauty world.</p>
    <p>High-pro­file blog­gers such as Caro­line Hirons, beauty ed­i­tors like Ch­eryl Wis­chhover and make-up artists in­clud­ing home-grown name Larry Yeo reg­u­larly share sci­ence-based con­tent and use their plat­forms to de­bunk pseu­do­science and mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s been nice to see peo­ple from the tra­di­tional in­flu­encer world cross over and use their plat­forms to am­plify sci­ence,” says Dr Chan.</p>
    <p>Which means that the only way to go, it seems, is full throt­tle for­ward.</p>
    <p>Dr Wong’s In­sta­gram ac­count, @lab­muffin­beau­ty­science, has a 192,000-strong fol­low­ing, and she says uni­ver­si­ties and gov­ern­ments now un­der­stand that sci­en­tific com­mu­ni­ca­tion is im­por­tant and are in­vest­ing more in it.</p>
    <p>But her great hope – one shared by Dr Chan – is that the beauty in­dus­try starts to share more about the sci­ence be­hind its prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>That and – as Ms Dou­glas points out – get­ting more women into the pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>“We need more women on this side of the lab bench. Join me, please. It’s lonely. I’m ex­cited to see more women us­ing this skillset for good and ap­ply­ing it to a lot of dif­fer­ent industries.</p>
    <p>“At one time be­ing a nerd was con­sid­ered a bad thing. Now we run the world.”</p>
