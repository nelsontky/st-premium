    <p>Travel agen­cies will work closely with tourism as­so­ci­a­tions to en­sure pas­sen­ger safety when the air travel bub­ble be­tween Hong Kong and Sin­ga­pore takes off.</p>
    <p>The two-way bub­ble an­nounced yes­ter­day will al­low travel be­tween both lo­ca­tions with­out quar­an­tine, sub­ject to con­di­tions, in­clud­ing test­ing neg­a­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Ms Ali­cia Seah, direc­tor of pub­lic re­la­tions and com­mu­ni­ca­tions at Dy­nasty Travel, noted that safety will be among Sin­ga­pore­ans’ top­most con­cerns if they travel.</p>
    <p>The agency will col­lab­o­rate with the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) and Hong Kong Dis­ney­land for out­bound travel, she said.</p>
    <p>“We will be work­ing closely with tourism as­so­ci­a­tions to pro­duce we­bi­nars with re­open­ing ad­vice for lo­cal at­trac­tions,” Ms Seah added.</p>
    <p>Top­ics in­clude de­vel­op­ing hy­giene prac­tices to re­as­sure vis­i­tors as well as ex­plor­ing “touch­less” ex­pe­ri­ences where vis­i­tors pre-book time slots or pre-pur­chase tick­ets.</p>
    <p>HKTB chair­man Pang Yiu Kai wel­comed the air bub­ble move, say­ing that Sin­ga­pore is one of the ma­jor source mar­kets of Hong Kong’s tourism in­dus­try. Last year, there were more than 450,000 vis­i­tor ar­rivals from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Dr Pang added that the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment restarted its pro­mo­tion cam­paign in July to draw Sin­ga­pore­ans over, while last week, HKTB launched a stan­dard­ised hy­giene pro­to­col for tourism-re­lated sec­tors with the Hong Kong Qual­ity As­sur­ance Agency.</p>
    <p>“The pro­to­col pre­pares the tourism-re­lated sec­tors to wel­come vis­i­tors back while bol­ster­ing vis­i­tors’ con­fi­dence in trav­el­ling to Hong Kong,” he said.</p>
    <p>Travel agency Chan Broth­ers said it has “pulled out all the stops to safe­guard trav­ellers’ and em­ploy­ees’ health and well-be­ing”.</p>
    <p>It has re­duced its group size to a max­i­mum of 25, while on-site group com­men­taries dur­ing tours have also been re­duced and re­placed when pos­si­ble with on-coach ones.</p>
    <p>Mr Con­rad Clif­ford, the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion’s (Iata) re­gional vice-pres­i­dent for Asia-Pa­cific, lauded the move to es­tab­lish a travel bub­ble.</p>
    <p>“Re­plac­ing quar­an­tine with test­ing will help in re­open­ing bor­ders, restor­ing the con­nec­tiv­ity that jobs and eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity de­pend on, and give pas­sen­gers greater con­fi­dence to travel,” he said. He noted that a re­cent Iata sur­vey of 11 mar­kets found that 83 per cent of re­spon­dents in­di­cated they would not travel if there was a chance of be­ing quar­an­tined at their des­ti­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The travel bub­ble move has ex­cited res­i­dents liv­ing in both cities.</p>
    <p>Lawyer Ho Wan Yi, a 29-year-old Sin­ga­porean liv­ing in Hong Kong, said: “Even though the two cities are only a few hours away by plane, the pan­demic has made it im­pos­si­ble for Sin­ga­pore­ans work­ing in Hong Kong to take weekend trips home to see fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>“It would be great to be able to fly back and forth freely again, with­out hav­ing to quar­an­tine for 14 days on both sides.”</p>
    <p>Ms Christa­bel Lum, 28, who works in the fin­tech sec­tor in Hong Kong, added: “Most Sin­ga­pore­ans based in Hong Kong have been un­able to go home for the past nine months, so this is def­i­nitely great news.</p>
    <p>“The travel bub­ble will make things a lot eas­ier too as we won’t have to fac­tor in an ex­tra seven to 14 days’ quar­an­tine each way.”</p>
    <p>Mr Nitin Kakaria, 40, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent in Sin­ga­pore, said he is plan­ning to go to Hong Kong for work and leisure once the date for the travel bub­ble is con­firmed.</p>
    <p>The In­dian na­tional, an ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor at a bank, said he worked in Hong Kong for eight years be­fore mov­ing to Sin­ga­pore. “I have zero con­cerns be­cause the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment has been do­ing well so far to con­tain the coro­n­avirus.”</p>
