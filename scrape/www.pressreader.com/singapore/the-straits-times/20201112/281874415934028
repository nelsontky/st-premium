    <p>What’s the story?</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan agreed to a Rus­sian-bro­kered peace deal to end weeks of heavy fight­ing in Nagorno-Karabakh and find a long-term so­lu­tion to the dis­pute over the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The deal ends six weeks of mil­i­tary con­flict in the South Cau­ca­sus re­gion that has killed more than 1,200 and left thou­sands dis­placed.</p>
    <p>The new peace deal was signed by Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin, Azer­bai­jani Pres­i­dent Il­ham Aliyev and Ar­me­nian Prime Min­is­ter Nikol Pashinyan.</p>
    <p>The terms in­clude:</p>
    <p>• A com­plete cease­fire and ces­sa­tion of all hos­til­i­ties. Both sides will main­tain po­si­tions in the ar­eas that they cur­rently hold. This is a sig­nif­i­cant gain for Azer­bai­jan as it re­claimed 15 per cent to 20 per cent of its lost ter­ri­tory dur­ing the re­cent con­flict, Agence France-Presse re­ported.</p>
    <p>• About 2,000 Rus­sian peace­keep­ers will be de­ployed along the line of con­tact in Nagorno-Karabakh. They will re­main there for a pe­riod of five years.</p>
    <p>• Refugees and in­ter­nally dis­placed per­sons will re­turn to the re­gion and the two sides will ex­change pris­on­ers of war and other de­tained per­sons, as well as bod­ies of those killed in the fight­ing.</p>
    <p>• A new trans­port cor­ri­dor will be opened through Ar­me­nia, link­ing Azer­bai­jan and its western ex­clave of Nakhchivan. It will be un­der Rus­sian con­trol.</p>
    <p>Why it mat­ters</p>
    <p>Nagorno-Karabakh is a small re­gion that strad­dles Western Asia and Eastern Europe. It is in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised as part of Azer­bai­jan, but most of it is con­trolled by Ar­me­nian sep­a­ratists and the ma­jor­ity of its pop­u­la­tion is Ar­me­nian.</p>
    <p>In the late 1980s, Ar­me­nia and Azer­bai­jan went to war for con­trol of the area, which es­ca­lated af­ter both de­clared in­de­pen­dence from the Soviet Union.</p>
    <p>Ar­me­nia’s claim to the re­gion has not been recog­nised by any United Na­tions mem­ber, all of whom still con­sider the dis­puted ar­eas as un­der Azer­bai­jani ju­ris­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>Fight­ing was re­newed in Septem­ber as both sides blamed each other for deadly at­tacks in the area.</p>
    <p>The dis­pute at­tracted re­gional and Western con­cern as the area is crossed by pipe­lines car­ry­ing oil and gas from the Caspian Sea to global mar­kets, re­ported The Guardian.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia is a ma­jor re­gional player and one of the co-chairs of the Minsk Group, the diplo­matic ef­fort</p>
    <p>to me­di­ate the Nagorno-Karabakh dis­pute. The group in­cludes the United States and France.</p>
    <p>What comes next?</p>
    <p>Soon af­ter Ar­me­nia’s Prime Min­is­ter an­nounced the “painful” deal, crowds started protests in the Ar­me­nian cap­i­tal of Yerevan, ac­cus­ing the gov­ern­ment of be­trayal as they be­lieved that fight­ing should have con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, there was a mood of cel­e­bra­tion in Azer­bai­jan’s cap­i­tal Baku, where crowds broke out in chants, waved flags and sang the na­tional an­them, re­ported the BBC.</p>
    <p>The agree­ment makes no men­tion of the fu­ture sta­tus of the Ar­me­nian-pop­u­lated ar­eas of Nagorno-Karabakh or how fu­ture ne­go­ti­a­tions will take place.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion now is: Will the deal hold?</p>
    <p>Since Septem­ber, mul­ti­ple cease­fire at­tempts have failed. Po­lit­i­cal op­po­si­tion to the deal in Ar­me­nia could im­pact the long-term success of the agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The dis­pute at­tracted re­gional and Western con­cern as the area is crossed by pipe­lines car­ry­ing oil and gas from the Caspian Sea to global mar­kets, re­ported</p>
    <p>The Guardian.</p>
