    <p>China an­nounced an ini­tia­tive to de­velop in­ter­na­tional stan­dards for data se­cu­rity yes­ter­day and called on gov­ern­ments not to force com­pa­nies to hand over user data.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi told a sem­i­nar in Beijing that the gov­ern­ment has pro­posed a “Global Ini­tia­tive on Data Se­cu­rity”, i nvit­ing other coun­tries to take part, adding that it would pro­mote mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism in an area where a “cer­tain coun­try” has been bul­ly­ing oth­ers.</p>
    <p>This comes barely a month af­ter United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump an­nounced a “Clean Net­work” ini­tia­tive, which seeks to ban from the US any Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy deemed a se­cu­rity risk.</p>
    <p>This could range from telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions com­pa­nies to soft­ware com­pa­nies and even apps.</p>
    <p>“A cer­tain coun­try keeps mak­ing ground­less ac­cu­sa­tions against oth­ers in the name of ‘clean’ net­work and used se­cu­rity as a pre­text to prey on en­ter­prises of other coun­tries who have a com­pet­i­tive edge,” Mr Wang said, with­out di­rectly nam­ing the US.</p>
    <p>China’s ver­sion of the pro­gramme would call on tech­nol­ogy firms not to in­stall “back doors” in their prod­ucts and ser­vices that could al­low for il­le­gal ac­cess to data.</p>
    <p>Par­tic­i­pants should also re­spect the sovereignt­y, ju­ris­dic­tion and data poli­cies of other mem­ber na­tions, while not re­quest­ing in­di­vid­ual data with­out their per­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang also said par­tic­i­pants would take “ac­tions to pre­vent and put an end to ac­tiv­i­ties that in­fringe upon per­sonal in­for­ma­tion, op­pose abus­ing in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy to con­duct mass sur­veil­lance against other states or en­gage in unau­tho­rised col­lec­tion of per­sonal in­for­ma­tion”.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies should not seek “il­le­git­i­mate in­ter­ests” by tak­ing ad­van­tage of users’ de­pen­dence, he said, adding that states should also not use cy­ber at­tacks to crip­ple key in­fra­struc­ture or steal i mpor­tant data.</p>
    <p>China has long faced ac­cu­sa­tions of cy­ber es­pi­onage and has in re­cent years come un­der fire from the US for in­stalling com­mu­ni­ca­tions in­fra­struc­ture that might con­tain loop­holes of­fer­ing ac­cess to Beijing.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, tech be­he­moth Huawei has borne the brunt of the back­lash, hav­ing its high-tech 5G in­fra­struc­ture equip­ment banned in the US, In­dia and sev­eral Euro­pean coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Huawei has ve­he­mently re­jected sug­ges­tions of se­cu­rity lapses and in­sisted that it has no links to the gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>China tightly con­trols and cen­sors the In­ter­net in the coun­try, and has for years re­stricted ac­cess to US In­ter­net com­pa­nies such as Google, Face­book and Twit­ter.</p>
    <p>In re­cent months, the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, cit­ing na­tional se­cu­rity con­cerns, has sought to ban video-shar­ing app TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-head­quar­tered ByteDance.</p>
    <p>Shortly be­fore rolling out the data se­cu­rity pro­gramme, China had ear­lier sought in­ter­na­tional sup­port for the ini­tia­tive, reach­ing out to diplo­mats from sev­eral na­tions.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a memo seen by The Straits Times, Beijing said the ini­tia­tive could pro­vide a blue­print for a pos­si­ble in­ter­na­tional stan­dard.</p>
    <p>“We hope that you can... pub­licly ex­press your po­lit­i­cal sup­port,” said a brief­ing note Chi­nese diplo­mats pro­vided to their for­eign coun­ter­parts.</p>
    <p>No fur­ther de­tails have been un­veiled about which coun­tries have signed up for the ini­tia­tive, what it would con­sist of and how it would be im­ple­mented.</p>
    <p>While the ini­tia­tive ap­pears to be an im­me­di­ate re­ac­tion to the US’ “Clean Net­work” pro­gramme, an­a­lysts say there could be some level of irony in what China is op­pos­ing.</p>
    <p>“The ac­tions (China) says it op­poses, there is am­ple ev­i­dence that it en­gages in those ac­tiv­i­ties, so it doesn’t op­pose those ac­tiv­i­ties when they are un­der­taken on its own terms,” said Dr Sa­man­tha Hoff­man, an an­a­lyst at the Aus­tralian Strate­gic Pol­icy In­sti­tute spe­cial­is­ing in Chi­nese cy­ber se­cu­rity.</p>
