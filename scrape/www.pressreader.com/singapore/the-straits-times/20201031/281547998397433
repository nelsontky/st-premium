    <p>Amid the global jobs cri­sis, Sin­ga­pore­ans have to ap­ply them­selves to the cen­tral eco­nomic prob­lem of the times: En­sur­ing there are enough jobs, and a bet­ter dis­tri­bu­tion of good jobs, says Se­nior Min­is­ter and Co­or­di­nat­ing Min­is­ter for So­cial Poli­cies Thar­man Shan­mu­garat­nam.</p>
    <p>We are on un­charted ter­rain. Covid-19 is a his­toric chal­lenge, but we are re­ally faced with three test­ing re­al­i­ties at the same time.</p>
    <p>We have the im­me­di­ate chal­lenge of a pub­lic health and eco­nomic cri­sis, both of global scale. But tack­ling this is com­pli­cated by the sec­ond re­al­ity – that of a new fu­ture that is al­ready un­fold­ing be­fore us, for which we have to re-gear our­selves. The shape of de­mand, sup­ply chains and the way work is or­gan­ised are all chang­ing, and with them the job mar­ket. Covid-19 and the fear of fu­ture pan­demics have brought on a new nor­mal that we must adapt to.</p>
    <p>Third, we in­herit long­stand­ing le­ga­cies, now made more chal­leng­ing by the Covid-19 cri­sis: the stag­na­tion of mid­dle in­comes in the ad­vanced world, widen­ing in­equal­i­ties, the grow­ing prospect of pen­sion gaps in many coun­tries, and an ever more se­ri­ous cli­mate cri­sis.</p>
    <p>It is th­ese three re­al­i­ties in­ter­act­ing to­gether that make this an im­mensely com­plex, dy­namic and daunt­ing time – for pub­lic pol­icy, for so­ci­ety, and for pol­i­tics ev­ery­where. Fo­cus­ing on to­day’s prob­lems in them­selves, with­out both ad­dress­ing the prob­lems we in­herit and equip­ping our­selves for a struc­turally dif­fer­ent fu­ture, will make the years to come even more test­ing, and fraught with dan­ger.</p>
    <p>TOO EARLY FOR CRE­ATIVE DESTRUC­TION</p>
    <p>Pol­i­cy­mak­ers have passed the first phase of tack­ling the eco­nomic cri­sis, where most na­tions were fo­cused on avoid­ing the ex­treme down­sides aris­ing from Covid-19 and lock­downs. We wanted to avoid mass un­em­ploy­ment and a large wave of bank­rupt­cies, which would have led to a self-re­in­forc­ing spi­ral of de­clin­ing in­comes and pub­lic spirit.</p>
    <p>We are now at a tran­si­tion point. We can­not pro­tect ex­ist­ing jobs, firms and in­dus­try ca­pac­ity to the ex­tent seen in the first phase. Most coun­tries do not have the fis­cal ca­pac­ity to do so. Strate­gi­cally too, we have to let some of to­day’s firms and jobs go, to en­able new growth and more promis­ing jobs to be cre­ated. We have to al­low for “cre­ative destruc­tion”, to se­cure vi­brant economies over the longer term.</p>
    <p>How­ever, we can­not pivot poli­cies too quickly into this next phase. Our economies are still in sig­nif­i­cant slack, the virus is far from tamed, and there is risk of re­peated lock­downs, es­pe­cially dur­ing the north­ern win­ter. Even on op­ti­mistic as­sump­tions, it will take much more than a year to get back to full eco­nomic life.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, with­draw­ing sup­port too quickly will not lead to ef­fi­cient mar­ket re­struc­tur­ing – the rechan­nelling of labour, cap­i­tal and other re­sources that takes us to a bet­ter place – in the way we would ex­pect in a typ­i­cal down­turn. We are op­er­at­ing with lit­tle vis­i­bil­ity of the fu­ture, ham­per­ing the abil­ity of ei­ther pol­i­cy­mak­ers or mar­kets to dis­crim­i­nate be­tween firms that are loss-mak­ing to­day but re­main vi­able for the fu­ture and the zom­bies that limp along on life sup­port. Cre­ative destruc­tion with­out this vis­i­bil­ity will lead to too many good firms and jobs be­ing de­stroyed.</p>
    <p>THE CEN­TRAL PROB­LEM: JOBS</p>
    <p>The cen­tral eco­nomic prob­lem of the times lies in labour mar­kets.</p>
    <p>First, there is a real prospect of pro­longed high un­em­ploy­ment in many economies. It is not at all as­sured that we will get back to tight labour mar­kets, even with tra­di­tional macroe­co­nomic poli­cies work­ing the way they should.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, we have to counter the long-term stag­na­tion of me­dian in­comes seen in a whole range of ad­vanced economies, with a few like Swe­den and Sin­ga­pore be­ing the ex­cep­tions. It can­not be achieved with­out re­viv­ing pro­duc­tiv­ity growth.</p>
    <p>Third, we have to ad­dress the trend to­wards a po­larised job mar­ket – with more jobs be­ing cre­ated at the high- and low-skilled ends of the labour mar­ket and fewer in the mid­dle, and the growth of an in­se­cure gig work­force.</p>
    <p>Each of th­ese is a dif­fi­cult chal­lenge, and over­com­ing all three even more so. While em­ploy­ment re­cov­ered well in some ma­jor economies in the decade af­ter the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, pro­duc­tiv­ity growth weak­ened (and in­deed was part of the rea­son why em­ploy­ment re­cov­ered) and job po­lar­i­sa­tion be­came more se­vere.</p>
    <p>There have been some pe­ri­ods in his­tory where we were able to achieve all three ob­jec­tives. One of the drivers of eco­nomic devel­op­ment, which No­bel lau­re­ate Arthur Lewis and other econ­o­mists high­lighted, con­sisted of sur­plus labour be­ing freed up from low-pro­duc­tiv­ity sec­tors (orig­i­nally agri­cul­ture) and taken up by sec­tors which had higher pro­duc­tiv­ity such as man­u­fac­tur­ing. That re­al­lo­ca­tion of labour is how low-in­come coun­tries be­came mid­dle in­come, and some mid­dle-in­come coun­tries be­came ad­vanced.</p>
    <p>But the ex­pe­ri­ence of re­cent years in many ad­vanced economies has been the re­verse – with labour be­ing shed from in­dus­tries that are dy­namic and at the higher end of the pro­duc­tiv­ity lad­der, and chan­nelled into lower-pro­duc­tiv­ity, lower-wage oc­cu­pa­tions. In fact, the main en­gine of job growth in the United States and sev­eral other coun­tries has been in lower-paid ser­vices – in F&B, clean­ing, se­cu­rity, and a range of other do­mes­tic ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has in­tro­duced a ma­jor dis­rup­tion to this al­ready po­larised, bar­bell-shaped mar­ket. The bot­tom end of the bar­bell is now it­self shrink­ing. A whole range of ser­vice tasks is be­ing elim­i­nated by e-com­merce, re­mote work, vir­tual pres­ence, and the safe dis­tanc­ing and other new pro­to­cols that we will prob­a­bly have to live with for some years.</p>
    <p>What this means is that the mar­ket re­cep­ta­cle for labour dis­placed from higher-pro­duc­tiv­ity in­dus­tries has shrunk. It was a re­cep­ta­cle of lower-pay and less-se­cure jobs, but what is even more unattrac­tive now is the prospect of fewer such jobs.</p>
    <p>We also face, in par­tic­u­lar, the un­rav­el­ling of some of the gains in women’s par­tic­i­pa­tion in the labour force and sense of self-de­ter­mi­na­tion that were achieved over decades. Women have been dis­pro­por­tion­ately rep­re­sented in the hu­man-fac­ing jobs that are be­ing hurt. The clo­sure of child­care and schools, each time it hap­pens, has also un­for­tu­nately trans­lated into more women than men stay­ing at home to look af­ter their kids.</p>
    <p>We have to ap­ply our­selves now and over the next few years to this cen­tral prob­lem of jobs: mak­ing sure we have enough jobs, and that peo­ple do not get trapped over time in low-skill, low-pay work.</p>
    <p>WIDEN­ING THE DIS­TRI­BU­TION OF GOOD JOBS</p>
    <p>What are some of the ini­tia­tives that we have to fo­cus on? We have to fo­cus not only on macroe­co­nomic stim­u­lus, but in­creas­ingly on the mi­croe­co­nomic in­cen­tives we cre­ate, and on new forms of</p>
    <p>col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween govern­ment, busi­ness and com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>First, we have to grad­u­ally phase out sub­si­dies for ex­ist­ing jobs and in­stead pro­vide strong in­cen­tive for job cre­ation. In other words, we should shift from sub­si­dis­ing the stock of jobs to­wards in­cen­tivis­ing the flow of new jobs. Sin­ga­pore is do­ing so with our Jobs Growth ini­tia­tive, as we step down the sig­nif­i­cant sub­si­dies for to­day’s jobs that our Jobs Sup­port Scheme pro­vided in the first phase of the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, we have to put great en­ergy into the co­or­di­na­tion needed to help peo­ple who are dis­placed to get back into jobs, and to avoid as much as pos­si­ble ill-fit­ting job matches that could lead to a per­ma­nent re­duc­tion in their wages.</p>
    <p>We must do all we can to avoid peo­ple be­ing de­tached from work for an ex­tended pe­riod, to pre­vent the de­pre­ci­a­tion of skills and morale that comes with that, and in­creased bar­ri­ers to their em­ploy­ment. Econ­o­mists call it “hys­tere­sis”. It is a real risk in the com­ing months and years.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the aim of job match­ing can­not sim­ply be about speed. It is not about get­ting some­one any job as soon as pos­si­ble, be­cause that can mean los­ing the value of the skills they have ac­cu­mu­lated. As much as pos­si­ble, we have to find jobs that build on a per­son’s skills and ex­pe­ri­ences. A key co­or­di­na­tion task, there­fore, is to find those jobs with ad­ja­cent or com­ple­men­tary re­quire­ments, and to move swiftly to top up the skills that the job seeker brings. We can­not take too long to help some­one se­cure a new job, but we have to strive for a good match with the hu­man cap­i­tal they have ac­cu­mu­lated, so that they do not lose it, and so­ci­ety does not lose it.</p>
    <p>Get­ting to this out­come is not easy, be­cause labour mar­kets suf­fer from im­per­fect in­for­ma­tion. It re­quires join­ing up ca­reer coach­ing, job match­ing and skills devel­op­ment pro­grammes. This is a very hu­man en­ter­prise, but greatly aided now by new ICT and AI tools. The most ef­fec­tive sys­tems have in­volved of­fi­cial agen­cies play­ing an ac­tive co­or­di­nat­ing role, work­ing with em­ploy­ers, job seek­ers, unions or other so­cial part­ners, and train­ing providers. In the con­text of the cur­rent un­cer­tain­ties, sig­nif­i­cant state sub­si­dies are also re­quired to en­cour­age em­ploy­ers to re­cruit and train peo­ple. If we leave it to the mar­ket, we will see longer spells of job­less­ness.</p>
    <p>We have to recog­nise too, in the wake of the pan­demic, that it will take time be­fore hir­ing for per­ma­nent jobs comes back on the scale we need. We have to in­cen­tivise firms to take in peo­ple on at­tach­ments of var­i­ous forms, even if they can­not take on per­ma­nent hires. This means not just youth ap­pren­tice­ships, but trainee­ships for ma­ture work­ers in their 40s and 50s. We have to work with in­dus­try part­ners to cu­rate trainee­ships, get peo­ple back into the work­place, and help them to add to their skills. We must find ev­ery way to avoid a long-term de­tach­ment from work, and the per­ma­nent scar­ring that comes with that.</p>
    <p>Third, we have to go be­yond the mantra of life­long learn­ing, to make it a prac­ti­cal re­al­ity for blue-col­lar and or­di­nary white-col­lar work­ers. All ex­pe­ri­ence, even in north­ern Europe where the tra­di­tion is most es­tab­lished, shows that it has been much harder to get this go­ing for or­di­nary work­ers than for high-skilled pro­fes­sion­als, which only ac­cen­tu­ates ex­ist­ing in­equal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>That has to be a core fo­cus of pub­lic-pri­vate col­lab­o­ra­tion – de­vel­op­ing qual­ity train­ing op­tions that work­ers find ap­peal­ing and rel­e­vant to their ca­reers, and us­ing tech­nolo­gies and com­mu­nity outreach pro­grammes that make learn­ing con­ve­nient when they are not on the job. It also re­quires in­creased agility in the sys­tem, to en­able firms and work­ers to de­velop new skills quickly as the econ­omy re­struc­tures.</p>
    <p>Fourth, we have to en­cour­age those forms of au­to­ma­tion that cre­ate new tasks or stim­u­late new de­mands that play to hu­man strengths. Tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vances have his­tor­i­cally both dis­placed work­ers and in­creased the de­mand for labour in new ar­eas – ei­ther within the same in­dus­try or in­di­rectly in the rest of the econ­omy. It has en­abled so­ci­ety to stay fully em­ployed while pro­duc­tiv­ity moved up. But that is an em­pir­i­cal reg­u­lar­ity, not a law. Se­ri­ous econ­o­mists, as well as busi­ness and tech­nol­ogy lead­ers them­selves, have dif­fer­ing views on whether we can be equally san­guine about an emerg­ing gen­er­a­tion of in­creas­ingly po­tent tech­nolo­gies, or whether we are head­ing for a per­ma­nent state of higher job­less­ness.</p>
    <p>We will not know in ad­vance. But we know that some new tech­nolo­gies, like col­lab­o­ra­tive ro­bots, aug­mented re­al­ity and cer­tain AI tools, gen­er­ate more de­mand for hu­man skills, in­clud­ing mid-level skills, than other ad­vances. Tax codes to­day in­cen­tivise au­to­ma­tion in al­most ev­ery form and ev­ery­where, even in coun­tries where labour mar­kets face sig­nif­i­cant long-term slack. It is not too early to con­sider how pub­lic pol­icy can en­cour­age au­to­ma­tion and skills devel­op­ment of the kinds that can com­ple­ment one an­other, so we in­crease the chances of a new era of widely dis­trib­uted good jobs.</p>
    <p>Fifth, we need col­lec­tively de­ter­mined so­lu­tions to en­sure that growth of worker com­pen­sa­tion does not trend be­low pro­duc­tiv­ity growth, as has hap­pened over the last few decades in many economies. In­sti­tu­tional in­ter­ven­tions, in­volv­ing the state, are es­pe­cially needed where the prob­lem of low or lag­ging wages re­flects ei­ther the weak­ened bar­gain­ing power of work­ers or in­creased monop­sony power of em­ploy­ers. Ideally too, th­ese in­ter­ven­tions should be ac­com­pa­nied by ef­forts to de­velop new so­cial and em­ployer mind­sets, so that new norms can per­sist in the labour mar­ket with­out re­quir­ing perpetual state in­ter­ven­tion. Norms do ap­pear to vary across coun­tries, es­pe­cially with re­gard to pay for women and less-skilled work­ers.</p>
    <p>Sixth, we need strate­gies to en­sure that the SME sec­tor survives and adapts to the new, post-pan­demic nor­mal, to avoid much larger job losses in time as well as greater wage in­equal­i­ties. SMEs are dis­pro­por­tion­ately rep­re­sented in the ser­vice sec­tors, where jobs have been most vul­ner­a­ble to the im­pact of Covid-19 and na­tional lock­downs. They also face greater fund­ing risk than large firms in an en­vi­ron­ment of un­cer­tainty. While a churn of busi­nesses is in­evitable and needed, there is a real risk of a di­min­ished SME sec­tor as a whole, com­pound­ing the in­creases in in­dus­try con­cen­tra­tion seen over the last few decades in many economies. That trend if it con­tin­ues will have im­pli­ca­tions for fu­ture eco­nomic vi­brance. It will likely also have an in­tan­gi­ble im­pact on so­cial cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments and cen­tral banks have been quick to en­sure near-term credit sup­port for SMEs. But we have to look be­yond this. Quite apart from up­dated com­pe­ti­tion poli­cies, what form of clus­ter strate­gies can we get to work well, and to en­able bet­ter dif­fu­sion of in­no­va­tion from the fron­tier firms to the rest? How do we in­cen­tivise test-bed­ding of in­no­va­tions in small firms them­selves? How do we ag­gre­gate and or­gan­ise skills train­ing for their work­ers, to ad­dress the grow­ing gaps in skill lev­els be­tween large and small firms? How do we pro­mote dig­i­tal plat­forms – and es­pe­cially in­ter-op­er­a­ble cross-bor­der plat­forms – that small firms can plug in to, so they can ben­e­fit from the scale economies of the dig­i­tal econ­omy?</p>
    <p>MONE­TARY AND FIS­CAL POLI­CIES: TAK­ING THE LONG VIEW</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments have done right to pull out all the stops to save their economies and jobs amidst the pan­demic. How­ever, we face a dif­fer­ent struc­tural fu­ture, com­pounded by the long­stand­ing so­cial and eco­nomic chal­lenges that we in­herit, that make this much more than a bad but tem­po­rary down­turn. It re­quires a longer-term ori­en­ta­tion in eco­nomic pol­i­cy­mak­ing and in the way we or­gan­ise our­selves to re­spond col­lec­tively.</p>
    <p>Mone­tary pol­icy has suc­ceeded in buffer­ing economies and fi­nan­cial sys­tems against a se­vere shock to con­fi­dence amidst Covid-19. How­ever, re­ly­ing chiefly on mone­tary pol­icy to get economies back to full health will be less ef­fec­tive over time and hold­ing in­ter­est rates near zero over a pro­longed pe­riod may have counter-pro­duc­tive ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Fis­cal pol­icy there­fore has to play a more im­por­tant role, in con­cert with labour mar­ket and in­dus­trial pol­icy re­forms. But it also re­quires a repur­pos­ing of the state – to defy sec­u­lar stag­na­tion, to catal­yse the green econ­omy, to rekin­dle so­cial mo­bil­ity and build equal op­por­tu­ni­ties, and to go about th­ese ob­jec­tives with a spirit of ac­tivism.</p>
    <p>Ex­pan­sive fis­cal poli­cies will make sense for a while, prob­a­bly a few years in most economies. But the real de­bate has to move from ques­tions around im­me­di­ate stim­u­lus ef­fects, to how we achieve our longer-term goals. We need a dif­fer­ent kind of Key­ne­sian­ism: an ac­tive state aimed at long-term re­cov­ery and re­gen­er­a­tion, na­tion­ally and glob­ally.</p>
    <p>We have to re­fo­cus on pub­lic goods, which used to be a fun­da­men­tal pur­pose of govern­ment bud­gets. They are now greatly un­der-in­vested in, not only in the emerg­ing world but in most ad­vanced economies. The pan­demic was a harsh re­minder of this, with pub­lic health sys­tems over­whelmed in many coun­tries. But this is now a huge op­por­tu­nity around the world: in­vest­ments to achieve broad-based qual­ity in pub­lic ed­u­ca­tion sys­tems, in­clud­ing reg­u­larly re­freshed tech­ni­cal and ap­plied train­ing; in more ac­ces­si­ble and af­ford­able health­care; in univer­sal broad­band ac­cess; in up­graded wa­ter and trans­port net­works; in R&D for clean en­er­gies, sus­tain­able agri­cul­ture and the cir­cu­lar econ­omy.</p>
    <p>We will not be able to fund th­ese in­vest­ments on pub­lic bal­ance sheets alone. The re­design of fis­cal strat­egy must also in­volve catalysing pri­vate in­vest­ment in pub­lic goods. There are many ex­am­ples of how this can be done, in­clud­ing ways to achieve a fair shar­ing of the risks on such in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Re­mem­ber that this pan­demic is not the last we will face, and the next pan­demic may very pos­si­bly be more chal­leng­ing than what we are go­ing through to­day. So we do need, once we have emerged from this cri­sis, to re­build fis­cal space to deal with fu­ture shocks – and at least avoid a con­tin­u­ing build-up of debt-to-GDP ra­tios. Most gov­ern­ments will have to strengthen tax rev­enues. They will have to do so while giv­ing a fair deal to those with lower and mid­dle in­comes, and en­sur­ing that fis­cal sys­tems meet the chal­lenge of po­lit­i­cally dura­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The repur­pos­ing of the state re­quires bold­ness of imag­i­na­tion, and the mar­shalling of pub­lic sup­port around na­tions’ long-term goals. It will help re­build broad-based pros­per­ity and co­he­sive so­ci­eties, and can put us on course to an eco­log­i­cally vi­able fu­ture. It may be our only chance.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments have done right to pull out all the stops to save their economies and jobs amidst the pan­demic. How­ever, we face a dif­fer­ent struc­tural fu­ture, com­pounded by the long­stand­ing so­cial and eco­nomic chal­lenges that we in­herit, that make this much more than a bad but tem­po­rary down­turn. It re­quires a longer-term ori­en­ta­tion in eco­nomic pol­i­cy­mak­ing and in the way we or­gan­ise our­selves to re­spond col­lec­tively.</p>
