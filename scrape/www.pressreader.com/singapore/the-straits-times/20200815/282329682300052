    <p>• Just when US Open or­gan­is­ers re­ceived the first piece of good news after men’s world No. 1 No­vak Djokovic con­firmed his par­tic­i­pa­tion, they were hit by an­other big-name with­drawal in women’s sin­gles de­fend­ing cham­pion Bianca An­dreescu.</p>
    <p>The 20-year-old Cana­dian, who de­feated Ser­ena Wil­liams in last year’s fi­nal for her maiden Grand Slam tri­umph, blamed the coron­avirus pan­demic for com­pro­mis­ing her abil­ity to pre­pare fully for the tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>An­dreescu suf­fered a knee in­jury at the WTA Fi­nals in Shen­zhen last Oc­to­ber and has not played on the WTA Tour since, with the near five­month stop­page ow­ing to the cri­sis not help­ing matters.</p>
    <p>In an of­fi­cial state­ment on Thurs­day, she said: “After many dis­cus­sions with those clos­est to me, I’ve made the dif­fi­cult de­ci­sion not to re­turn to New York this year.</p>
    <p>“I have taken this step in or­der to fo­cus on my match fit­ness and en­sure that I re­turn ready to play at my high­est level.”</p>
    <p>Her de­ci­sion meant Flush­ing Mead­ows will be miss­ing both reign­ing sin­gles cham­pi­ons, as men’s world No. 2 Rafael Nadal had ear­lier con­firmed he would skip the event.</p>
    <p>“The US Open vic­tory last year has been the high point of my ca­reer this far and I will miss not be­ing there,” said An­dreescu.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, I re­alise that the un­fore­seen chal­lenges, in­clud­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, have com­pro­mised my abil­ity to pre­pare and com­pete to the de­gree nec­es­sary to play at my high­est level.</p>
    <p>“I want to ex­press my ap­pre­ci­a­tion to the United States Ten­nis As­so­ci­a­tion and the WTA Tour for all of their ef­forts in mak­ing the event hap­pen. I look for­ward to join­ing my com­peti­tors back on court soon.”</p>
    <p>While or­gan­is­ers have de­cided to go ahead with the Grand Slam with­out fans and im­ple­ment strict health and safety mea­sures – in­clud­ing reg­u­lar Covid-19 test­ing in a bid to stem the spread of the virus – many play­ers re­main un­will­ing to travel to the United States, which is the worst-hit coun­try in the world.</p>
    <p>The sixth-ranked An­dreescu is the latest top-10 women’s player to give the year’s sec­ond Slam a pass, join­ing world No. 1 and French Open cham­pion Ashleigh Barty of Aus­tralia, No. 5 Elina Svi­tolina of Ukraine and sev­enth-ranked Dutch­woman Kiki Bertens.</p>
    <p>Wimbledon cham­pion and Ro­ma­nian world No. 2 Simona Halep is said to be sit­ting on the fence, but Rus­sian 2004 US Open win­ner Svetlana Kuznetsova, Czech Barbora Strycova and China’s Wang Xiyu are out.</p>
    <p>The list of men’s ab­sen­tees in­cludes Aus­tralia’s Nick Kyr­gios, Swiss Stan Wawrinka, France’s Gael Mon­fils and Ital­ian Fabio Fognini, while 20-time Slam win­ner Roger Fed­erer of Switzer­land has pulled out after un­der­go­ing knee surgery.</p>
