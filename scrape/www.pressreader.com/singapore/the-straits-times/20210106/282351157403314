    <p>• For­mer Manch­ester United man­ager Alex Fer­gu­son has said it is his per­sonal duty and the game’s re­spon­si­bil­ity to ad­dress the prob­lem of de­men­tia that has im­pacted sev­eral for­mer play­ers.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of de­men­tia in the pro­fes­sional game was sparked by the death of 1966 World Cup win­ner Nobby Stiles in Oc­to­ber and there have been calls for the is­sue of head in­juries in sport to be given fur­ther at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Stiles and many of his for­mer Eng­land team­mates had been di­ag­nosed with de­men­tia be­fore their deaths, while United great Bobby Charl­ton also dis­closed his di­ag­no­sis re­cently.</p>
    <p>“It’s been very sad. Bobby’s not been well for a while. The gates have been opened by Nobby’s pass­ing and Bobby’s di­ag­no­sis.</p>
    <p>“They are huge fig­ures. It has to cre­ate an aware­ness,” Fer­gu­son told the Daily Mail.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know what the Pro­fes­sional Foot­ballers’ As­so­ci­a­tion (PFA) is do­ing but the League Man­agers As­so­ci­a­tion is con­cerned and (chief ex­ec­u­tive) Richard Be­van has been fan­tas­tic.</p>
    <p>“We have to see what we can do to help. Foot­ball has a duty to look at the sit­u­a­tion... Peo­ple like my­self owe it to the game to see if there’s some­thing we can do.”</p>
    <p>The PFA has said clubs, leagues and the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion must de­velop a strat­egy to mon­i­tor and adapt train­ing, and also come up with tech­niques that will pro­tect the long-term health of play­ers.</p>
    <p>There have been wide­spread calls to re­duce head­ing dur­ing train­ing ses­sions and Fer­gu­son is sup­port­ive of any move.</p>
    <p>“Head­ing is a part of foot­ball that has been there for over 100 years and you can’t take it out,” the 79-year-old Scot said. “But I think it would be easy to re­duce it in train­ing.”</p>
    <p>Fer­gu­son, as well as Liver­pool great Kenny Dal­glish and Eng­land boss Gareth South­gate, will take part in an on­line event this month to raise money for the bat­tle against de­men­tia.</p>
