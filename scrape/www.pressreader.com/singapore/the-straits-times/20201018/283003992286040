    <p>A Hindu man has cre­ated waves by be­ing the first to do­nate funds for the con­struc­tion of a mosque in In­dia to re­place one that was de­mol­ished by a Hindu mob nearly three decades ago.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court last year called the de­mo­li­tion of the 16th­cen­tury Babri Masjid in 1992 by the mob of Hindu na­tion­al­ists an “egre­gious vi­o­la­tion of (the) rule of law”.</p>
    <p>It handed the dis­puted site in Ay­o­d­hya where the mosque stood to Hindu groups, while giv­ing Mus­lim groups an al­ter­na­tive site in Dhan­nipur vil­lage, over 20km away, bring­ing the bit­ter dis­pute to an end.</p>
    <p>Mr Ro­hit Sri­vas­tava, 44, ex­plain­ing why he felt com­pelled to do­nate 21,000 rupees (S$390) to build the mosque, said: “I have been see­ing there is a di­vide be­tween Hin­dus and Mus­lims. If you see any in­dus­try, Hin­dus and Mus­lims work side by side. We can’t live without the other, that’s the re­al­ity. We are the tyres of a bi­cy­cle. If one tyre falls off, the bi­cy­cle will stand still.”</p>
    <p>Mr Sri­vas­tava, a se­nior staff mem­ber in Lucknow Univer­sity’s law fac­ulty, added: “I gave (the money) from my heart. Mine is a very small ges­ture.”</p>
    <p>But in a sign of the ex­ist­ing re­li­gious fault lines, Mr Sri­vas­tava, who has a four-year-old daugh­ter, said he has re­ceived neg­a­tive feed­back in­clud­ing a death threat on so­cial me­dia. “I never thought there would be so much neg­a­tive feed­back, but I also did not know I would get so much sup­port.”</p>
    <p>He said some of his friends asked why he had not do­nated to a Hindu tem­ple be­ing built at the orig­i­nal site in Ay­o­d­hya in­stead.</p>
    <p>“I come from Lucknow which is known for tehzeeb (cul­ture). It is part of our tehzeeb that the other per­son comes first. So I do­nated to the mosque, I will do­nate an equal amount to the tem­ple.”</p>
    <p>The de­mo­li­tion of Babri Masjid by the Hindu mob tore at the coun­try’s sec­u­lar fab­ric. Many Hin­dus be­lieve the mosque had been built on top of a tem­ple to Lord Rama. The de­mo­li­tion fanned com­mu­nal ten­sions and led to the deaths of more than 2,000 peo­ple in ri­ots, deep­en­ing re­li­gious</p>
    <p>LOOK­ING TO THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>What’s past is the past. The masjid will be con­tem­po­rary and iconic. It will not be repli­cated from any­where. What­ever con­tem­po­rary ar­chi­tec­ture is hap­pen­ing will be in­cor­po­rated. New tech­nol­ogy, new meth­ods and new ma­te­rial will go into the mosque.</p>
    <p>DR S.M. AKHTAR, pro­fes­sor and found­ing dean of the ar­chi­tec­ture depart­ment at Jamia Mil­lia Is­lamia Univer­sity in Delhi.</p>
    <p>fault lines within the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Last month, an In­dian court ac­quit­ted top Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lead­ers, in­clud­ing former deputy prime min­is­ter Lal Kr­ishna Ad­vani, of any wrong­do­ing over the mosque de­mo­li­tion. The BJP lead­ers, who were among 32 ac­quit­ted, had been ac­cused of in­cit­ing the mob that de­mol­ished the mosque. The court said there was no con­clu­sive ev­i­dence sup­port­ing the ac­cu­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The di­vi­sions seem to have widened lately, with crit­ics of Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s govern­ment say­ing the pas­sage of the Cit­i­zen­ship Amend­ment Act early this year giv­ing cit­i­zen­ship to non-Mus­lims in neigh­bour­ing coun­tries had fanned re­li­gious ten­sions.</p>
    <p>The move sparked wide­spread protests by those who be­lieve it goes against the spirit of the In­dian Con­sti­tu­tion, which pro­motes sec­u­lar­ism. But pro­po­nents said it was aimed at fast-track­ing cit­i­zen­ship for per­se­cuted mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>It also be­came a flash­point for Hindu-Mus­lim com­mu­nal ri­ots in north-east Delhi in Fe­bru­ary which killed 53 peo­ple, ex­ac­er­bat­ing the grow­ing di­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>Still, those be­hind the mosque project said they wanted to look to the fu­ture and not at the past.</p>
    <p>“What’s past is the past. The masjid will be con­tem­po­rary and iconic. It will not be repli­cated from any­where,” said Dr S.M. Akhtar, pro­fes­sor and found­ing dean of the ar­chi­tec­ture depart­ment at Jamia Mil­lia Is­lamia Univer­sity in Delhi. “What­ever con­tem­po­rary ar­chi­tec­ture is hap­pen­ing will be in­cor­po­rated. New tech­nol­ogy, new meth­ods and new ma­te­rial will go into the mosque.”</p>
    <p>Dr Akhtar is de­sign­ing other fa­cil­i­ties for the mosque com­plex, in­clud­ing a 200-bed multi-spe­cial­ity hos­pi­tal, a pub­lic li­brary, a re­search cen­tre show­cas­ing the her­itage of Indo-Is­lamic civil­i­sa­tion and a com­mu­nity kitchen.</p>
    <p>“The hos­pi­tal is on a high pri­or­ity. There are not a lot of health fa­cil­i­ties in the district,” he said, not­ing that much de­pended on how they were able to mo­bilise re­sources.</p>
    <p>The Ut­tar Pradesh Sunni Cen­tral Waqf Board, which is spear­head­ing the con­struc­tion of the com­plex, will be launch­ing a web­site for peo­ple to do­nate on­line.</p>
    <p>Mr Zu­far Ah­mad Fa­rooqui, chair­man of the board, said: “I can’t give a def­i­nite time­line (on when con­struc­tion will start). We are hop­ing it will be­come clearer in two to three months. The site is good.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, work on the tem­ple at the orig­i­nal site started in Au­gust and is due for com­ple­tion in 31/</p>
    <p>2 years. Mr Fa­rooqui said the first do­na­tion by a Hindu man sig­nalled to­geth­er­ness. “(The do­na­tion) shows our com­pos­ite cul­ture, what we are as In­di­ans, how we are in­sep­a­ra­ble in spite of all this bit­ter­ness.”</p>
