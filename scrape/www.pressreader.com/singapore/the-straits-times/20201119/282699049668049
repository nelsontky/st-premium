    <p>TAIPEI • Vet­eran Tai­wanese singer Bobby Chen Sheng has held a year-end con­cert every year for the last 26 years with­out fail.</p>
    <p>But Chen will not be hold­ing a year-end con­cert this year.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Chen, 62, who is known for songs such as One Night In Bei­jing and I Left Sad­ness To My­self, con­firmed on Face­book that he is tak­ing “sick leave” for the first time in 27 years.</p>
    <p>He con­firmed ear­lier me­dia re­ports that he had a mouth tu­mour.</p>
    <p>Chen’s band told Tai­wan’s Ap­ple Daily that the singer had felt un­com­fort­able in the mouth dur­ing a press con­fer­ence on Oct 15 and went for a health screen­ing last month.</p>
    <p>The doc­tors dis­cov­ered a tu­mour in his mouth and sug­gested that he re­move it as soon as pos­si­ble. Chen has since been op­er­ated on suc­cess­fully.</p>
    <p>He said in his Face­book post that he has been naive to think he could still main­tain his pre­vi­ous ex­er­cise reg­i­men after reach­ing the age of 60, adding that he had cy­cled for up to six hours in one ses­sion a week.</p>
    <p>He apol­o­gised to fans who have been wait­ing ea­gerly for his con­cert: “I may have over­stretched my­self phys­i­cally in the past with­out know­ing it, but for­tu­nately, heaven has taken care of me.</p>
    <p>“To con­tinue to write songs, per­form, meet you and cel­e­brate the new year to­gether, this model stu­dent with full at­ten­dance has to take a break and fol­low the doc­tor’s ad­vice to rest by re­duc­ing the fre­quency of talk­ing and sing­ing.”</p>
    <p>“I will rest for a while, take good care of my­self and re­turn to meet ev­ery­one in the best con­di­tion,” he added.</p>
