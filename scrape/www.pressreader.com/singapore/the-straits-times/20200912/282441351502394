    <p>The two-man board of Ax­ing­ton is en­gag­ing with con­trol­ling share­hold­ers Nel­son Loh and Terence Loh to ob­tain clar­ity on strate­gic changes to be made in the busi­ness di­rec­tion of the com­pany, the Catal­ist-listed firm said in a bourse fil­ing late on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>It added that its board un­der­stands the Loh cousins are con­tin­u­ing to “ex­plore strate­gic pos­si­bil­i­ties with re­spect to the com­pany”.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton was re­spond­ing to queries from the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) sub­mit­ted on Wed­nes­day. SGX had asked for an up­date on the strate­gic changes to be made in Ax­ing­ton’s busi­ness di­rec­tion, and an up­date on the busi­ness of the group in re­la­tion to its ex­ec­u­tive de­ci­sion-mak­ing func­tion and man­age­ment, among other things.</p>
    <p>The pro­fes­sional ad­vi­sory ser­vices group had in July pro­posed to change its core busi­ness to med­i­cal and con­sumer well­ness ser­vices, and to in­vest in med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy, ro­bot­ics and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tech­nol­ogy in the med­i­cal and con­sumer well­ness space.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing con­tro­versy sur­round­ing a bid for English foot­ball club New­cas­tle United by the Lohs and Ax­ing­ton former non-in­de­pen­dent and non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Evan­ge­line Shen, the firm on Sept 6 re­quested a vol­un­tary sus­pen­sion of its shares, pend­ing an an­nounce­ment re­lated to strate­gic changes in its busi­ness di­rec­tion. Ms Shen and four other di­rec­tors also re­signed from the board last month.</p>
    <p>In its re­sponse to SGX on Thurs­day, the com­pany said its board is in the midst of iden­ti­fy­ing suit­able can­di­dates to be ap­pointed as ex­ec­u­tives to over­see its day-to-day op­er­a­tions, and the im­ple­men­ta­tion of any strate­gic changes to the busi­ness di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is in the process of re­view­ing the ex­per­tise and ex­pe­ri­ence of these can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton said its au­dit com­mit­tee, re­mu­ner­a­tion com­mit­tee and nom­i­nat­ing com­mit­tee cur­rently do not com­ply with Catal­ist rules.</p>
    <p>Its board will en­deav­our to fill the va­can­cies “as soon as prac­ti­ca­bly pos­si­ble”, it added.</p>
    <p>The counter last traded at $0.19 on Aug 25.</p>
