    <p>Ja­pan busted its record for daily new Covid-19 cases again yes­ter­day, led by soar­ing in­fec­tions in Tokyo. The surg­ing cases forced its gov­ern­ment to raise its alert over a health­care break­down to the most se­ri­ous tier on a four-point scale since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan rewrote its one-day Covid-19 tally yes­ter­day with at least 3,211 new cases, led by a record-bust­ing 822 in­fec­tions in Tokyo, prompt­ing Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike to is­sue a “spe­cial year-end Covid-19 warn­ing”.</p>
    <p>The wors­en­ing sit­u­a­tion comes de­spite Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga’s Nov 24 state­ment that the fol­low­ing three weeks would be “de­ci­sive in de­feat­ing the coro­n­avirus”.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese me­dia said the three­week pe­riod – which ended on Tues­day – has been a clear de­feat for the gov­ern­ment, whose mud­dled poli­cies have been blamed for the soar­ing cases.</p>
    <p>“There has not been a sin­gle piece of data show­ing that the sit­u­a­tion is mov­ing in a pos­i­tive di­rec­tion,” Dr Yoshi­hiro Ya­m­aguchi, head of trauma and crit­i­cal care at Ky­orin Univer­sity Hospi­tal in Tokyo, told the Asahi Shim­bun news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>The surge in cases in Tokyo forced the met­ro­pol­i­tan gov­ern­ment to raise – for the first time – the alert over a health­care break­down to the most se­ri­ous tier on a four-point scale since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>The seven-day av­er­age of new cases hit a new high of 565.9 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>An­other gauge, of the sever­ity of the out­break, was raised to the high­est red alert last month.</p>
    <p>Ms Koike said: “Hos­pi­tals are clogged, and could soon lose the abil­ity to per­form ba­sic func­tions at a crit­i­cal time of the year.</p>
    <p>“Tokyo’s health­care sys­tem is ap­proach­ing ca­pac­ity.”</p>
    <p>She in­structed the au­thor­i­ties to in­crease the num­ber of beds for Covid-19 pa­tients to 4,000 from the cur­rent 3,000, although doc­tors are warn­ing that there are not enough nurses to go around.</p>
    <p>Osaka and Hokkaido have had to seek help from mil­i­tary nurses, and fears are high that Tokyo might also be on the brink.</p>
    <p>Tokyo rewrote its Covid-19 record for the sec­ond straight day yes­ter­day, reg­is­ter­ing a 21.2 per cent jump from the pre­vi­ous high of 678 set a day ear­lier.</p>
    <p>De­spite all this, there has been no vis­i­ble change in the move­ment of peo­ple, as warn­ings fall on deaf ears among many who are de­ter­mined not to let Covid-19 be a party pooper.</p>
    <p>The Go To Travel do­mes­tic tourism cam­paign had come un­der such se­vere at­tack – crit­ics say it is il­log­i­cal to en­cour­age peo­ple to travel on the one hand and avoid close con­tact on the other – that Mr Suga on Mon­day abruptly sus­pended it from Dec 28 to Jan 11.</p>
    <p>That cov­ers what is typ­i­cally one of the busiest travel pe­ri­ods in the coun­try as mil­lions of Ja­panese re­turn to their home towns for fam­ily gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, whose ap­proval rat­ings are tum­bling, also apol­o­gised on Wed­nes­day amid a pub­lic back­lash for hav­ing at­tended two din­ner par­ties – with 15 peo­ple at a lux­ury ho­tel and seven peo­ple at a high-end steak­house.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cial guide­lines ask peo­ple to cap party sizes to five or fewer peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga said he “sin­cerely re­grets” an ac­tion that would “in­vite mis­un­der­stand­ing”.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Cab­i­net min­is­ters rushed to de­fend him, stress­ing that the five-or-fewer guide­line was “not an en­force­able hard and fast rule” and that it was nec­es­sary for the leader to “hear a wide range of views”.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, cases are surg­ing across Ja­pan, with 10 pre­fec­tures log­ging more than 100 in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Tokyo, they are Osaka (351), Kana­gawa (319, a new high), Aichi (238), Saitama (196), Hyogo (164), Chiba (148), Hokkaido (139), Hiroshima (138, a new high) and Fukuoka (108).</p>
    <p>In the Greater Tokyo re­gion, Ms Koike and her coun­ter­parts in Saitama, Chiba and Kana­gawa are ask­ing rail­way com­pa­nies to can­cel all-night ser­vices on New Year’s Eve.</p>
    <p>“We must ex­er­cise all ef­forts to pre­vent con­ges­tion, and I urge peo­ple to de­lay the tra­di­tion of hat­sumode (first shrine visit of the new year) this time,” she said.</p>
