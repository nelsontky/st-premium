    <p>Ten days be­fore he was set to depart for the 2008 Bei­jing Olympics as Sin­ga­pore’s chef de mis­sion (CDM), Dr Tan Eng Liang suf­fered a slipped disc af­ter a fall at home.</p>
    <p>De­spite the ex­cru­ci­at­ing pain, he sol­diered on with a cock­tail of painkiller­s and led a con­tin­gent that re­turned home with a sil­ver medal, Sin­ga­pore’s first Olympic medal af­ter a 48-year drought.</p>
    <p>Laugh­ing at the mem­ory, the 83-year-old said: “A num­ber of my con­tem­po­raries felt I was crazy to risk my life and go as CDM when I wasn’t well. To me, that was se­condary. My main pur­pose was to get the job done.”</p>
    <p>Flinty yet hands-on and hum­ble, the vet­eran sport ad­min­is­tra­tor leaves an in­deli­ble mark af­ter step­ping down as vice-pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore National Olympic Coun­cil (SNOC) at its an­nual gen­eral meet­ing yes­ter­day fol­low­ing 28 years of ster­ling ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent and former national ath­letes and of­fi­cials paid trib­ute to Dr Tan in a heart­warm­ing video by the SNOC.</p>
    <p>Former national pad­dler Wang Yuegu, who was part of the women’s ta­ble ten­nis team that won sil­ver in 2008, re­counted his key role in the achieve­ment.</p>
    <p>She said: “If not for him, I’m not sure if I could have made it to the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. There was some ten­sion within the team then and Dr Tan met us to me­di­ate.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter the meet­ing, he told me I needed to per­se­vere and be more tol­er­ant and pa­tient. I felt he is a very wise old man. His warm smile put me at ease and I wasn’t so afraid any more. Be­cause of how he han­dled the sit­u­a­tion, I de­vel­oped trust and love for Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>His un­der­stand­ing of an ath­lete’s mind stems from his back­ground as a former national water polo player who rep­re­sented Sin­ga­pore in mul­ti­ple ma­jor Games.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his play­ing days were over, he en­tered pol­i­tics where he served for close to a decade as MP and then se­nior min­is­ter of state.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong called it a priv­i­lege to have known Dr Tan for al­most 50 years, and said in the video: “Your com­mit­ment to make Sin­ga­pore proud and your pas­sion to give your best in all that you do will in­spire younger gen­er­a­tions to work hard at their dreams and never give up.”</p>
    <p>Sports re­mained his first love and he served as Sin­ga­pore Sports Coun­cil – now known as Sport Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>HE WALKS THE TALK</p>
    <p>(SportSG) – chair­man (1975-1991) and SNOC vice-pres­i­dent (1992-2020). He was also Sin­ga­pore’s CDM at a record 12 ma­jor Games, start­ing from the Los An­ge­les Olympics in 1984.</p>
    <p>Dr Tan counts it an “hon­our and priv­i­lege” to have played a part in SNOC’s growth, and his fond­est memories of his time there was when he was in the spe­cial train­ing as­sis­tance com­mit­tee, which works with SportSG to visit ath­letes while they were pre­par­ing for ma­jor Games, up un­til 2018.</p>
    <p>“I love sports, so when I vol­un­teer, it means con­tri­bu­tion and work be­cause it would be mean­ing­less if you have just the po­si­tion and you don’t show up,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Am­a­teur Box­ing As­so­ci­a­tion pres­i­dent Syed Ab­dul Kadir re­called how he had ar­gued with Dr Tan for more money to help the</p>
    <p>smaller national sports as­so­ci­a­tions pre­pare for the 2015 SEA Games on home soil. Ul­ti­mately, 14 sports re­ceived a $300,000 boost in to­tal from the SNOC and con­trib­uted to the record 84 golds and 259 medals over­all.</p>
    <p>Fel­low SNOC vice-pres­i­dent Jessie Phua called him a “ge­nius of a sport­ing leader” who was never in it for the lime­light.</p>
    <p>She said: “He comes into ev­ery meet­ing 100 per cent pre­pared. Very few can match him. His love and care and pas­sion for sport are un­par­al­leled.”</p>
    <p>Former SNOC pres­i­dent Teo Chee Hean added: “He al­ways in­sisted on high stan­dards and rais­ing those stan­dards. He helped push our ath­letes and teams to keep on achiev­ing more. It is one of the rea­sons over the years, our ath­letes have done bet­ter at the ma­jor</p>
    <p>Games.”</p>
    <p>Dr Tan shared that he had al­ready made plans to step down two years ago and felt the tim­ing was right, as he was di­ag­nosed with Stage 4 lung can­cer ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>He plans to step down as Olympians Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent next year and see through his stint as chair­man of the Sin­ga­pore Taek­wondo Fed­er­a­tion in­terim com­mit­tee un­til its World Taek­wondo membership is re­in­stated.</p>
    <p>On top of pay­ing trib­ute to him, SNOC pres­i­dent Tan Chuan-Jin also joked: “Even if you tell him to re­tire, I don’t think he will com­pletely let go. He will still be kay­poh (Singlish for nosy). I’m sure I’ll be get­ting calls from him.”</p>
    <p>While he is step­ping back, Dr Tan’s mind is still on the fu­ture of Sin­ga­pore sport, as he be­moaned the lack of young sports lead­ers com­ing through who stay the course.</p>
    <p>He said: “My stan­dards are full com­mit­ment, ded­i­ca­tion and do­ing the job for the love of the sport. The fact that some of these young peo­ple fade away shows they can­not make it or they have no real in­ter­est.”</p>
    <p>And the oc­to­ge­nar­ian had a part­ing mes­sage for the Government, urg­ing it to recog­nise the con­tri­bu­tions of Sin­ga­pore’s Olympians via ges­tures such as free ac­cess to pub­lic sports fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He added: “I have been try­ing for the last four years, but I can’t get through. I will keep ad­vo­cat­ing for this... I will be open to any lunch in­vite to talk about sports. I don’t need any po­si­tion, just cof­fee or tea will do.”</p>
    <p>I love sports, so when I vol­un­teer, it means con­tri­bu­tion and work be­cause it would be mean­ing­less if you have just the po­si­tion and you don’t show up.</p>
