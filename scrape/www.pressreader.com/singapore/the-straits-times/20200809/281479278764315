    <p>The lights have dimmed on Sin­ga­pore’s once-thriv­ing nightlife sec­tor, and with no cer­tainty as to when op­er­at­ing re­stric­tions will be lifted, the in­dus­try is mount­ing a fight for its sur­vival.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Nightlife Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion (SNBA) has ap­pealed to the Gov­ern­ment to either al­low all nightlife op­er­a­tors to re­open, or to help them nav­i­gate their op­tions.</p>
    <p>This would en­tail sup­port for busi­nesses to pivot, hi­ber­nate or liq­ui­date, SNBA pres­i­dent Joseph Ong told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“Op­er­a­tors can then pick and choose from op­tions that help them to move to the next stage, rather than wait for re­open­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>About two-thirds of SNBA’s 320 mem­bers have been able to re­sume oper­a­tions in phase two of the Repub­lic’s grad­ual re­open­ing as they have li­cences that al­low them to op­er­ate as f ood and bev­er­age (F&B) es­tab­lish­ments.</p>
    <p>But for these firms, vi­a­bil­ity re­mains a grave con­cern.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions on group sizes and live en­ter­tain­ment and a 10.30pm curb on al­co­hol sales pose sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenges, as the sec­tor re­lies pri­mar­ily on am­bi­ence, so­cial in­ter­ac­tion and post-din­ner crowds, in­dus­try play­ers said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, land­lords are knock­ing on the doors of the bars, pubs, night­clubs and karaoke lounges that re­main shut­tered, af­ter manda­tory rental waivers ended last month.</p>
    <p>The wage sub­si­dies that have pre­vented more than half of 130 such busi­nesses from re­trench­ing work­ers – ac­cord­ing to an in­dus­try poll – will also con­clude this month, with a fi­nal pay­out in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Night­clubs and KTV es­tab­lish­ments form the bulk of those that re­main shut due to the higher risk of coro­n­avirus trans­mis­sion, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mates that the nightlife in­dus­try em­ploys up to 50,000 work­ers, in­clud­ing bar­tenders, se­cu­rity guards and per­form­ers.</p>
    <p>A re­cent poll by SNBA and the Sin­ga­pore En­ter­tain­ment Af­fil­i­a­tion, which rep­re­sents karaoke op­er­a­tors, found that of about 130 re­spon­dents that have yet to open, about 40 per cent said they would have to shut per­ma­nently if they could not re­open by this month.</p>
    <p>Less than 10 per cent said they would sur­vive to end-Oc­to­ber if the clo­sures con­tin­ued.</p>
    <p>In the first six months of the year, 59 night­clubs, dis­cothe­ques, dance clubs and karaoke lounges wound up, ac­cord­ing to the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>THREE PRO­POSED PATH­WAYS</p>
    <p>Dis­cus­sions are on­go­ing be­tween SNBA and the au­thor­i­ties to work out the next steps as di­rect cash sub­si­dies run dry.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said the as­so­ci­a­tion has put forth three path­ways for op­er­a­tors, among other sug­ges­tions that bal­ance busi­ness con­cerns and fears of a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>These in­clude gov­ern­ment aid to help busi­nesses pivot, such as re­struc­tur­ing grants and con­sul­tancy ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Some busi­nesses may also choose to hi­ber­nate un­til they can re­sume oper­a­tions, and can be sup­ported through sub­sidised rental and tem­po­rary re­de­ploy­ment of staff.</p>
    <p>For those that opt to throw in the towel, help can be ren­dered with un­wind­ing ten­ancy and other con­tracts, such as through le­gal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>This would al­low both par­ties to come to mu­tu­ally agree­able so­lu­tions and pre­vent costly law­suits and per­sonal li­a­bil­i­ties, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>To help food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ments sur­vive, the SNBA has also pro­posed ex­tend­ing the hours for al­co­hol sales while lim­it­ing seat­ing times to re­duce the risk of ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>“This would also en­cour­age peo­ple to go home af­ter­wards rather than carry on in a pri­vate set­ting,” Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>PRECINCT MODEL</p>
    <p>A suc­cess­ful model for how nightlife can re­sume safely amid the Covid-19 pan­demic has yet to emerge as cities bat­tle re­cur­ring waves of in­fec­tion, but Sin­ga­pore could lead the way, in­dus­try play­ers said.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nity cases here have re­mained low with many bars and en­ter­tain­ment out­lets al­ready open, which points to the fact that safe man­age­ment mea­sures are work­ing, they said.</p>
    <p>Some precincts with a heavy pres­ence of nightlife es­tab­lish­ments are also tak­ing ex­tra pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>At Clarke Quay, for ex­am­ple, tem­per­a­ture screen­ing sta­tions are po­si­tioned at four key en­trances.</p>
    <p>Like the malls that it man­ages, Cap­i­taLand has im­ple­mented SafeEn­try re­quire­ments to en­ter, as well as a max­i­mum ca­pac­ity of one per­son per 10 sq m.</p>
    <p>Clarke Quay’s cen­tre man­ager Adrian Lai said that about 85 per cent of the 60 or so out­lets there have re­opened, and both mar­ket­ing and safety ef­forts have been ramped up.</p>
    <p>Restau­rant-bar Le Noir, which re­opened its Clarke Quay out­let last month, said sales are down 70 per cent.</p>
    <p>The 10.30pm re­stric­tion on al­co­hol sales means that pa­trons of­ten end up hav­ing din­ner and drinks at the same place, noted</p>
    <p>founder Mark Brim­ble­combe.</p>
    <p>“Clarke Quay has lim­ited en­try points so it’s quite self-con­tained and has good con­tact trac­ing. The land­lord has been very sup­port­ive, but un­til the hours go be­yond 10.30pm it will be hard for the area to pick up,” he said.</p>
    <p>In Hol­land Vil­lage, where an eatery was sus­pended in June af­ter crowds in the area be­came un­ruly, op­er­a­tors have come to­gether to form a code of con­duct to stan­dard­ise their prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The SNBA helped to draft the code for the precinct, pop­u­lar for the out­door seat­ing of­fered by bars and eater­ies that line the streets.</p>
    <p>The code sets out the rules in place and cre­ates an agree­ment for how op­er­a­tors should re­act to pa­trons who vi­o­late safe dis­tanc­ing rules, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said: “Prior to this, many didn’t feel they had the obli­ga­tion or right to tell peo­ple gath­er­ing out­side their es­tab­lish­ment to stop.</p>
    <p>“But as a col­lec­tive group, ev­ery­one agrees in­fringe­ment is bad not just for their oper­a­tions but for the precinct.”</p>
    <p>Aside from the code, op­er­a­tors in the area have also formed a com­mit­tee and keep in touch through a What­sApp chat group.</p>
    <p>Such mod­els for precinct self­man­age­ment may help to pre­vent Sin­ga­pore from mak­ing the mis­takes that oth­ers have in re­sum­ing ac­tiv­i­ties, Mr Ong said.</p>
    <p>“I am hope­ful and con­fi­dent that with the way some of these land­lords and op­er­a­tors are work­ing with the au­thor­i­ties, we will see more and more sand­boxes open­ing up.”</p>
    <p>The min­istries of Trade and In­dus­try and Home Af­fairs said in re­sponse to queries that nightlife es­tab­lish­ments will not be per­mit­ted to re­sume ac­tiv­i­ties for some time.</p>
    <p>“We have seen the rapid spread of Covid-19 through night­clubs and pub­lic en­ter­tain­ment venues over­seas, and we must learn from these oc­cur­rences to avoid a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion hap­pen­ing in Sin­ga­pore,” they said in a joint re­ply.</p>
    <p>Tokyo and Seoul have seen a resur­gence in Covid-19 cases linked to night­clubs and bars.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, some nightlife es­tab­lish­ments that hold both pub­lic en­ter­tain­ment and food shop li­cences have been al­lowed to op­er­ate, the min­istries added.</p>
    <p>This is con­tin­gent on them ceas­ing to pro­vide pub­lic en­ter­tain­ment, among other re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The min­istries said the Gov­ern­ment is work­ing closely with the in­dus­try to de­ter­mine pos­si­ble so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>NEW CON­CEPTS</p>
    <p>Nightlife op­er­a­tors are keep­ing them­selves afloat by cre­at­ing new rev­enue streams.</p>
    <p>Le Noir’s Mr Brim­ble­combe is launch­ing an online plat­form called Anynight In that al­lows con­sumers to book home ex­pe­ri­ences by per­form­ers and F&B op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese iza­kaya Neon Pi­geon, which closed its eatery last month, is among those sign­ing up to of­fer its house party ex­pe­ri­ence, com­plete with sig­na­ture dishes and cock­tails.</p>
    <p>“Go­ing for­ward, home en­ter­tain­ment is go­ing to be very im­por­tant. Covid-19 will change so­cial be­hav­iour as peo­ple re­alise they don’t al­ways have to go out to have fun,” Mr Brim­ble­combe said.</p>
    <p>Some night­clubs will also be sub­mit­ting pro­pos­als to the au­thor­i­ties to change their con­cepts, as crowded dance floors are un­likely to re­turn any time soon.</p>
    <p>Zouk, which con­verted its Cap­i­tal lounge into a restau­rant last month, has been cater­ing to a fully booked din­ing room every week­end, Zouk Group’s chief ex­ec­u­tive An­drew Li said.</p>
    <p>This, to­gether with food de­liv­er­ies from its other out­lets, sale of bot­tled cock­tails, live-stream­ing tie-up with Lazada, pay cuts, wage sub­si­dies and rental waivers, has helped the group to break even this month, he said.</p>
    <p>But once sup­port schemes come to an end, it is a ques­tion of how long the in­dus­try can sur­vive.</p>
    <p>“Most places are prob­a­bly do­ing 20 per cent to 25 per cent of their orig­i­nal rev­enues,” he said.</p>
    <p>Push­ing all bars to ob­tain restau­rant li­cences is not sus­tain­able as the F&B in­dus­try is suf­fer­ing too, and there is no guar­an­teed re­turn on in­vest­ment, Mr Li added.</p>
    <p>Zouk will be sub­mit­ting a pro­posal to the au­thor­i­ties this week for a new con­cept for its club space, he said, but pro­vided no de­tails.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong, who is also man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of 1-Group, said its port­fo­lio of cafes, restau­rants and bars have kept rev­enue from fall­ing be­low 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>Its 1-Al­ti­tude rooftop bar has re­fo­cused on din­ing, and he hopes to trans­form Yang club at Clarke Quay into a din­ner con­cept fea­tur­ing ac­ro­batic and other per­for­mances.</p>
    <p>While the group can af­ford the $200,000 in­vest­ment this would cost, not all op­er­a­tors can pivot with­out help, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Li said that while op­er­a­tors are grate­ful for the sup­port that has been given thus far, a time­line for re­open­ing is para­mount for the in­dus­try and its work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Some might want to wait it out, but it’s a com­pletely dif­fer­ent sce­nario if it’s two months ver­sus six months or a year.”</p>
