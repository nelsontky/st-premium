    <p>2020 has been a year of up­heaval and crisis – one that was shaped by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. It also saw sig­nif­i­cant de­vel­op­ments, such as a gen­eral elec­tion in Sin­ga­pore and the United States elect­ing its next leader. In this 12-day se­ries,</p>
    <p>The Straits Times spot­lights 20 words or phrases that de­fined 2020.</p>
    <p>The hith­erto-un­known Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group shot to promi­nence in Au­gust when it made a bold £280 mil­lion (S$504 mil­lion) bid for English Premier League foot­ball club New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean cousins Nel­son Loh and Ter­ence Loh had founded the group with Chi­nese en­tre­pre­neur Evan­ge­line Shen in July.</p>
    <p>News of the bid made head­lines, and the word “Bel­la­graph” be­came known in var­i­ous quar­ters.</p>
    <p>But fame quickly turned into in­famy – the trio’s plan un­rav­elled when the me­dia ex­posed how they had used doc­tored im­ages pur­port­ing to show that they were rub­bing shoul­ders with high-pro­file per­son­al­i­ties like for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama in Paris.</p>
    <p>While the Loh cousins and Ms Shen had taken pho­tos with Mr Obama at a char­ity event they spon­sored in Sin­ga­pore in De­cem­ber last year, they cer­tainly did not hold any pri­vate meet­ing with him in Paris.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s mar­ket­ing chief Nerei­des An­to­nio Gi­a­mundo de Bour­bon later ad­mit­ted to Reuters that the pic­tures were doc­tored.</p>
    <p>The group also billed it­self as “a world’s lead­ing con­glom­er­ate” with 31 en­ti­ties in “all ma­jor busi­ness fields, from fi­nan­cial to sport, health­care and luxury goods, en­ter­tain­ment and robotics”.</p>
    <p>It claimed rev­enue of US$12 bil­lion (S$16 bil­lion) last year and said it had 23,000 em­ploy­ees and a new head­quar­ters in Paris – all of which were not sub­stan­ti­ated when probed by the me­dia.</p>
    <p>One In­sta­gram post by BN Group claimed it had 10,000 pri­vate jets at its dis­posal. But a re­port in The Guardian last year said there were only 4,700 pri­vate jets in op­er­a­tion around the world.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also said one of its en­ti­ties was im­ple­ment­ing a trad­ing sys­tem for the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change. An­other en­tity was said to have paid $20 mil­lion for a 55 per cent stake in two day surgery cen­tres – Ap­tus Surgery Cen­tre at Paragon Med­i­cal Cen­tre and No­vap­tus Surgery Cen­tre at Cam­den Med­i­cal Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times found out that those claims were un­true.</p>
    <p>As the com­pany and its founders came un­der in­tense scru­tiny, in­di­vid­u­als and or­gan­i­sa­tions dis­tanced them­selves or de­nied any ties with them.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton, a Catal­ist-listed com­pany owned by the Lohs, had to halt trad­ing. Sev­eral direc­tors, in­clud­ing for­mer US am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Kirk Wa­gar, stepped down be­cause of the grow­ing con­tro­versy sur­round­ing the group.</p>
    <p>The con­tro­versy also prompted the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity (Acra) to look into the reg­is­tra­tion of en­ti­ties linked to the Loh cousins in Sin­ga­pore, of which eight were found to have breached Acra reg­u­la­tions. En­force­ment ac­tions are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, the po­lice launched an in­ves­ti­ga­tion i nto Novena Global Health­care Group (NGHG), reg­is­tered in the Cay­man Is­lands by the Loh cousins, after ac­count­ing firm Ernst & Young made a po­lice re­port al­leg­ing unau­tho­rised sig­na­tures were used in some fi­nan­cial state­ments re­lated to the group.</p>
    <p>With the po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion and scan­dal dog­ging the Loh cousins and their web of com­pa­nies, they de­cided in Oc­to­ber to legally sep­a­rate all their busi­ness in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>The sep­a­ra­tion agree­ment saw Mr Nel­son Loh, 41, leav­ing NGHG and Mr Ter­ence Loh, 43, leav­ing the BN Group, for the price of $1 each.</p>
    <p>In the lat­est de­vel­op­ment this month, the High Court granted an ap­pli­ca­tion by DBS Bank to wind up NGHG’s Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered sub­sidiary – Novena Global Health­care – which owes the bank more than $14 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>NGHG also owes mil­lions of dol­lars to Citibank, UOB, Maybank and Stan­dard Char­tered Bank.</p>
    <p>The Lohs were not par­tic­u­larly known in Sin­ga­pore’s cor­po­rate cir­cles be­fore they made news with their au­da­cious bid to take over the foot­ball club.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Peak mag­a­zine in 2018, the Loh cousins said they had let a roulette wheel spin in a casino in Las Ve­gas to de­cide if they should leave their cushy in­vest­ment bank­ing po­si­tions at JP Mor­gan to start their own busi­ness in 2008.</p>
    <p>They spoke about grow­ing their health­care busi­ness into one of Asia’s largest in­te­grated med­i­cal health­care and aes­thetic groups.</p>
    <p>And while some fam­i­lies had bro­ken apart be­cause of busi­ness feuds, they claimed to have grown closer. Trust was never an is­sue and there was no sec­ond-guess­ing each other, they said.</p>
    <p>But fam­ily bonds have come un­der se­vere stress this year.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment in re­sponse to DBS’ ap­pli­ca­tion to wind up Novena Global Health­care, which he co-founded with his cousin, Mr Ter­ence Loh last month said: “Per­haps more than any­one else, I feel deeply be­trayed by Nel­son, who has left Sin­ga­pore and ap­pears to have no in­ten­tion to sort out this ter­ri­ble mess we are left with.”</p>
