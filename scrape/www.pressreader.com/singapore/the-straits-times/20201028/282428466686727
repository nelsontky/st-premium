    <p>Ap­ple re­leased the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro last Fri­day. Those who want the iPhone 12 mini and the iPhone 12 Pro Max have to wait till Nov 13.</p>
    <p>Here is how the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro stack up against each other. Do note that iPhone 12 mod­els no longer come with EarPods (Ap­ple’s wired ear­phones with Light­ning con­nec­tor) and a power adap­tor – only a USB-C-toLight­ning ca­ble and a SIM card ejec­tor.</p>
    <p>DE­SIGN AND DIS­PLAY</p>
    <p>The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro share the same de­sign and di­men­sions. Un­like the curved sides of their pre­de­ces­sors, both phones have flat sides rem­i­nis­cent of the iPhone 5.</p>
    <p>The big­gest vis­ual dif­fer­ence is in the 12 Pro’s squar­ish rear camera mod­ule, which ac­com­mo­dates its ex­tra camera – it has three cam­eras, while the iPhone 12 has two. The 12 Pro is also 25g heav­ier.</p>
    <p>The iPhone 12 fea­tures an alu­minium band and glass chas­sis and comes in five new colours: green (ver­sion tested), white, black, blue and red. The 12 Pro comes in sil­ver, graphite, gold and a new pa­cific blue (ver­sion tested). Its chas­sis is a stain­less-steel band with a rear glass back with a tex­tured matt fin­ish.</p>
    <p>I like the pa­cific blue as it is cool to have a phone that “changes” colour. At cer­tain an­gles, it looks space grey and even black. I also pre­fer its matt fin­ish, which makes it less slip­pery and less of a smudge mag­net. On the flip side, I find the 12 Pro’s stain­less-steel band to be a fin­ger­print mag­net, while the iPhone 12’s alu­minium band does not seem to at­tract any prints.</p>
    <p>Both mod­els boast the same 6.1-inch Oled dis­play with a ce­ramic shield front said to of­fer four times bet­ter drop pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>The dis­play is gor­geous. Icons look un­be­liev­ably sharp. With a peak bright­ness of 1,200 nits, the dis­play is vis­i­ble un­der bright sun­light. The only down­side is it does not have a re­fresh rate of 120Hz, which is found in many An­droid flag­ship phones and al­lows vis­i­bly smoother an­i­ma­tions and tran­si­tions.</p>
    <p>The screen notch of both iPhones – which houses the TrueDepth camera – is also prom­i­nent, com­pared with the tiny hole-punch camera in some flag­ship An­droid phones.</p>
    <p>But none has the so­phis­ti­cated Face ID tech­nol­ogy of the TrueDepth camera. Still, in this age of mask-wear­ing, I was hop­ing Ap­ple would add an on-dis­play fin­ger­print sen­sor.</p>
    <p>Both the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro hit the sweet spot be­tween screen size and han­dling. They are even eas­ier to hold and use than the iPhone 11 as they are slightly smaller.</p>
    <p>CAMERA</p>
    <p>Like the iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 has a rear dual-camera sys­tem con­sist­ing of a 12-megapixel (MP) ul­trawide-an­gle and a 12MP wide-an­gle cam­eras.</p>
    <p>The 12 Pro has a rear triple-camera sys­tem with the same ul­trawide-an­gle and wide-an­gle cam­eras, but with an ex­tra 12MP tele­photo camera with 2x op­ti­cal zoom. It also has an ad­vanced Li­dar (light de­tec­tion and rang­ing) scan­ner for aug­mented re­al­ity use.</p>
    <p>Both mod­els’ wide-an­gle camera now has a big­ger f/1.6 aper­ture, which al­lows more light into the im­age sen­sor. Plus, with the new seven-el­e­ment lens, im­age qual­ity should be bet­ter and sharper.</p>
    <p>The best part about the iPhone 12 mod­els is Night mode, now avail­able in all the cam­eras. In its pre­de­ces­sors, Night mode was not avail­able in the front-fac­ing and ul­trawide-an­gle cam­eras.</p>
    <p>You can now take long-ex­po­sure im­ages with Night mode us­ing the ul­tra-wide-an­gle camera. If you are into self­ies, this is a huge plus. I use the Night mode of both mod­els to snap a selfie in a dark spot at VivoCity. When I com­pare the im­ages with the one taken by my iPhone 11 Pro Max, the ones shot on the iPhone 12 mod­els are much brighter and sharper.</p>
    <p>How do the rear cam­eras fare? All the night-scene pho­tos taken by both iPhone 12 mod­els of­fer very high dy­namic range, with sharp de­tails in the dark ar­eas, while keep­ing high­lights from be­ing over­ex­posed. Im­age noise is also rea­son­ably low. That is about the same qual­ity I get with my 11 Pro Max. I can hardly find any dif­fer­ence in sharp­ness and de­tails, whether in day or night shots.</p>
    <p>Only for ul­tra-wide-an­gle shots do I find pho­tos taken on the new iPhones to be less dis­torted, with slightly more de­tail.</p>
    <p>PER­FOR­MANCE, 5G CON­NEC­TIV­ITY</p>
    <p>Both iPhones use Ap­ple’s new six­core A14 Bionic chip, hailed by the com­pany as the fastest chip in a smart­phone and the first built on a 5nm process. This means it can pack more tran­sis­tors for much bet­ter per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>In the GeekBench 5 bench­mark tests, both phones per­form com­pa­ra­bly. The iPhone 12 scores 1,607 points in the sin­gle-core test and 4,002 points in the multi-core test, while the 12 Pro comes close with 1,602 (sin­gle-core) and 4,088 (multi-core) points.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, my 11 Pro Max scores 1,326 (sin­gle-core) and 3,276 (multi-core) points. Sam­sung’s im­pres­sive Galaxy Note20 Ul­tra scores 909 (sin­gle-core) and 2,536 (multi-core) points.</p>
    <p>In real life, all apps start in­stantly and run ef­fort­lessly on both iPhones. When play­ing top-notch rac­ing games such as As­phalt 9: Leg­ends, graph­ics look crisp with de­tailed tex­tures on both phones.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple sup­plied a Sing­tel 5G SIM card to test the phones’ 5G per­for­mance. Us­ing the Speedtest app on my 11 Pro Max on Sing­tel 4G and the 12 Pro on 5G at VivoCity, I find the down­load speed on the 12 Pro to be nine times faster, while its up­load speed is 21/ times faster.</p>
    <p>BAT­TERY LIFE</p>
    <p>In the video loop­back bat­tery stress test, the iPhone 12 lasts 10 hours and 55 min­utes, while the 12 Pro lasts 11 hours and 10 min­utes. In com­par­i­son, the iPhone 11 goes for 11 hours and 20 min­utes, while my 11 Pro Max lasts 13 hours and 10 min­utes.</p>
    <p>With con­stant check­ing of so­cial me­dia and e-mails as well as us­ing What­sApp, the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro should eas­ily get you through the whole day on a sin­gle charge.</p>
    <p>IPHONE 12 OR IPHONE 12 PRO?</p>
    <p>Both are ex­cel­lent smart­phones with great cam­eras and ca­pa­bil­i­ties. You can­not go wrong with ei­ther. But if I have to choose, it would be the 12 Pro for the ex­tra tele­photo camera and the nice blue colour.</p>
    <p>If you want some­thing smaller, wait for the iPhone 12 mini. If you pre­fer a big­ger dis­play and a larger im­age sen­sor with a new sta­biliser, wait for the iPhone 12 Pro Max.</p>
