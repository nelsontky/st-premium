    <p>Mr Bernard C.G. Law’s let­ter should get peo­ple think­ing hard about whether they need a maid, and the im­pact of be­ing overly de­pen­dent on do­mes­tic help (Fam­i­lies should ex­am­ine need to em­ploy maid, Jan 5).</p>
    <p>When my wife and I had our third child 31 years ago, my wife quit her job to fo­cus on rais­ing the chil­dren and manag­ing the house­hold chores with­out a maid. We still do not em­ploy one. Al­though we have had to do all the things that a maid would have done, we had the op­por­tu­nity to train our chil­dren to be in­de­pen­dent and pre­pare them to be bal­anced in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>I am re­pulsed when­ever I see adults hav­ing the maid fetch them a cup of wa­ter. Some grow up not know­ing how to cut an ap­ple, as they have had their maids do­ing it for them all along.</p>
    <p>When I pick up my grand­daugh­ter from pre-school, I of­ten en­counter a woman who picks up her son with two maids in tow. I also know a man who em­ploys three maids, even buy­ing a car for one to ferry his dogs to the vet­eri­nar­ian.</p>
    <p>I be­lieve such a way of life con­trib­utes to neg­a­tive so­cial out­comes, in­clud­ing rais­ing a gen­er­a­tion of chil­dren who are not in­de­pen­dent and do not know how to clean up af­ter them­selves.</p>
    <p>Of course, there are sit­u­a­tions where a maid is nec­es­sary – for in­stance, car­ing for se­niors who are un­able to go about daily life with­out as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Some fam­i­lies may need a maid to look af­ter their young chil­dren when both par­ents are work­ing.</p>
    <p>But in­fant care and child­care fa­cil­i­ties can be a great help, so it is de­bat­able whether maids are needed to fill this role.</p>
    <p>The bot­tom line then is for peo­ple to care­fully con­sider whether they re­ally need a maid. Lawrence Loh Kiah Muan</p>
