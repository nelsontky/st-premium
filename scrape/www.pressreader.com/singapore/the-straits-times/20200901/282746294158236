    <p>FIC­TION</p>
    <p>It has been a New York Times best­seller for 11 weeks, is listed as one of Van­ity Fair’s best books of the year to date and is one of Time Magazine’s 45 New Books You Need To Read This Sum­mer.</p>
    <p>In June, HBO paid a seven-fig­ure sum for the rights to turn it into a lim­ited tele­vi­sion se­ries.</p>
    <p>Yet there is some­thing miss­ing in The Vanishing Half. Amer­i­can au­thor Brit Ben­nett’s sec­ond novel hinges on the dis­parate lives of the Vignes sis­ters – iden­ti­cal, light­skinned twins who grow up i n Mallard, Louisiana, a fic­tional town of peo­ple of colour in the Jim Crow­era south, where dark­ness equals trou­ble and lo­cals pride them­selves on the fair­ness of their skin.</p>
    <p>Not black, but not white ei­ther, they are “fair and blonde and red­headed, the dark­est ones no swarthier than a Greek”, and with ev­ery gen­er­a­tion they strive to cre­ate “a more per­fect Ne­gro. Each gen­er­a­tion lighter than the one be­fore”.</p>
    <p>Light­ness does not save the twins’ fa­ther, who is lynched be­fore their young eyes by vi­o­lent, an­gry white men jeal­ous of his busi­ness acu­men.</p>
    <p>The sense­less­ness of this trauma and the colourism of the town drive the twins, at 16, to run away from Mallard in 1954 and start new lives in New Or­leans.</p>
    <p>From there, their lives and their sto­ries di­verge, “split­ting as evenly as their shared egg. Stella be­came white and De­siree mar­ried the dark­est man she could find”.</p>
    <p>With creamy skin, hazel eyes and wavy hair, the twins can pass as white, which means that any­one who does not know their ra­cial his­tory would never think oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>When Stella takes a j ob as an of­fice sec­re­tary, a job exclusive to white women, she de­cides to aban­don her home town, her mother and her twin with­out warn­ing, and pur­sue a life of safety and priv­i­lege as a white woman full-time.</p>
    <p>De­siree moves to Washington D.C. and mar­ries Sam, a black man who be­comes abu­sive. The story opens with De­siree’s re­turn to Mallard, 14 years af­ter run­ning away, now with her “blue­black” daugh­ter Jude in tow.</p>
    <p>De­spite her clear in­tel­li­gence and ath­letic tal­ents, Jude is bul­lied and os­tracised through­out her child­hood be­cause of how black she is.</p>
    <p>When she even­tu­ally leaves Mallard for Los An­ge­les on a track schol­ar­ship, she falls in love with</p>
    <p>Reese, a trans­gen­der man who started life as Therese. To­gether, they sub­tly tease apart the na­ture of iden­tity – how much of our iden­tity is in­nate, how much is choice and how much of it is cre­ated by or for us?</p>
    <p>Though the par­al­lels of gen­der de­ter­min­ism and ra­cial iden­tity are in­ter­est­ing, Ben­nett does not flesh the con­nec­tions out.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing a trans­gen­der char­ac­ter in the novel reads like an at­tempt to pla­cate calls for di­ver­sity of rep­re­sen­ta­tion in lit­er­a­ture and is a dis­trac­tion from the juicier ide­o­log­i­cal foun­da­tion of the novel, which is the per­for­ma­tive na­ture of ra­cial iden­tity and the ab­sur­dity of racism.</p>
    <p>The most in­ter­est­ing and heartwrenc­h­ing scenes in the book be­long to Stella, who has mar­ried a blue-blooded white man from New Eng­land and moved to a wealthy gated community in the Brent­wood sub­urb of Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>Act­ing as white through­out her adult life has hol­lowed her out. She is numb, re­served and con­stantly afraid of be­ing found out.</p>
    <p>When a black fam­ily moves in across the street, it is Stella who vo­cally op­poses their ar­rival at a community meet­ing, be­cause she is scared they will recog­nise her for who she is – not white – and ruin her per­fect life with her hus­band and blonde, blue-eyed daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>As she fights for sur­vival, she even­tu­ally be­friends the new neigh­bours, and the novel is kept afloat by the moral reck­on­ing she ex­pe­ri­ences while epit­o­mis­ing and chal­leng­ing the in­ter­nalised op­pres­sion of white supremacy.</p>
    <p>The Vanishing Half comes alive in th­ese emo­tional and in­tel­lec­tual in­ter­ro­ga­tions of race, colour and iden­tity.</p>
    <p>If only De­siree had re­ceived the same nar­ra­tive treat­ment. We never learn why she mar­ried “the black­est man she could find” or what life was like for her when she re­turned to Mallard with a deeply black child.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, Ben­nett is a skilled writer who keeps the pages turn­ing, and a book like The Vanishing Half will en­gen­der des­per­ately needed con­ver­sa­tions i n Amer­ica and around the world.</p>
