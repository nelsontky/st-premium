    <p>With Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte en­ter­ing his lame-duck year in of­fice, the fate of a key mil­i­tary pact be­tween the Philip­pines and the United States will be up to who­ever suc­ceeds him in May next year.</p>
    <p>This pact, known as the Vis­it­ing Forces Agree­ment (VFA), was signed in 1998. It gives le­gal cover to thou­sands of US troops who are ro­tated in the Philip­pines for mil­i­tary ex­er­cises and hu­man­i­tar­ian as­sis­tance op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte threat­ened in Jan­uary last year to re­peal it over a US de­ci­sion to deny en­try to a po­lit­i­cal ally. Six months later, with a coro­n­avirus pan­demic rag­ing and the Philip­pine econ­omy tank­ing, he walked back that de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Pres­i­dent threat­ened again to scrap the VFA if the Amer­i­cans fail to de­liver for him 20 mil­lion doses of a vac­cine against Covid-19. But it is wish­ful think­ing that he could get the vac­cines this way; the US gov­ern­ment can­not dic­tate upon the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms where to bring their vac­cines.</p>
    <p>In any case, the VFA’s fate will soon be out of Mr Duterte’s hands.</p>
    <p>Go­ing by re­cent polls of lead­ing con­tenders to suc­ceed him, the next pres­i­dent will be an­other Duterte: his daugh­ter Sara Duterte-Car­pio, the cur­rent mayor of Davao City. If she suc­ceeds him, she will be the one who will de­ter­mine if the VFA stays or not, and in the process, shape for years to come Manila’s re­la­tions be­tween the two ri­vals – the US and China.</p>
    <p>A DIPLO­MATIC RE­SET</p>
    <p>A new leader in the Mala­canang Palace in it­self changes the dy­nam­ics in the tus­sle for in­flu­ence be­tween the two big pow­ers for re­gional dom­i­nance. For the US, a new gov­ern­ment of­fers the chance to re­set ties with a crit­i­cal ally that nose­dived un­der Mr Duterte.</p>
    <p>The big ques­tion is: Will Ms Duterte-Car­pio fol­low in her fa­ther’s foot­steps?</p>
    <p>To be sure, Mr Duterte’s shadow will con­tinue to loom large even after he steps down, but so far his daugh­ter does not seem to share her fa­ther’s deep per­sonal dis­dain for Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>Ms Duterte-Car­pio has also not shown as much en­thu­si­asm as her fa­ther to­wards China.</p>
    <p>She ac­knowl­edges China’s sub­stan­tial con­tri­bu­tions, es­pe­cially to Davao. But she is also not too quick to dis­miss con­cerns over the pro­lif­er­a­tion of Chi­nese-run on­line gam­ing firms in the Philp­pines that have led to a huge in­flux of Chi­nese into the coun­try, the na­tional se­cu­rity threat posed by Chi­nese firms with con­tracts with Philip­pine tel­cos, or China’s claims to nearly all of the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>In other words, China will have to step up its game in man­ag­ing re­la­tions with Manila once Mr Duterte leaves the scene.</p>
    <p>AN ENIGMA</p>
    <p>Un­like her fa­ther, who says ex­actly what is on his mind, Ms Duterte-Car­pio, 42, is dif­fi­cult to read.</p>
    <p>Pro­fess­ing dis­in­ter­est in the pres­i­dency, she de­manded that poll­sters re­move her name from fu­ture sur­veys just after a na­tional poll by Pulse Asia Re­search was re­leased on Dec 31. The poll showed her ahead of a num­ber of can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>But, she had also said pre­vi­ously that she would likely have reached a de­ci­sion to run for pres­i­dent by this time.</p>
    <p>Ms Duterte-Car­pio rarely talks about global is­sues, pre­fer­ring in­stead to im­merse her­self in the parochial pol­i­tics of Davao. She did make a foray once out­side her fief­dom to help her fa­ther re­tain con­trol of Congress, but – mis­sion ac­com­plished – she just as abruptly re­treated back to Davao.</p>
    <p>She is as mer­cu­rial, blunt, brash and colour­ful as her fa­ther. She once punched a sher­iff on na­tional TV four times in the face for ig­nor­ing her plea to spare a squat­ter colony from de­mo­li­tion.</p>
    <p>With her hus­band Manases Car­pio, a lawyer, she named her chil­dren Sharky, 10, Stingray, six, and Stone­fish, two.</p>
    <p>Like her fa­ther, she has a pen­chant for rid­ing big mo­tor­cy­cles. She owns a 900cc Yamaha XSR900 that she named Ella.</p>
    <p>NOT HER FA­THER’S DAUGH­TER</p>
    <p>But she is also un­like her fa­ther in some im­por­tant ways. She has openly dis­agreed with him and some of his poli­cies, and has sought to tem­per his ver­bal ex­cesses.</p>
    <p>She is, for in­stance, against shift­ing from a uni­tary to a fed­eral form of gov­ern­ment, which is a pil­lar of her fa­ther’s leg­isla­tive agenda. It will only em­power “po­lit­i­cal war­lords”, she ar­gues.</p>
    <p>Ms Duterte-Car­pio also does not suf­fer fools lightly, even if these fools are close, pow­er­ful friends of her fa­ther. In 2018, she teamed up with key power bro­kers in Congress to oust then Speaker Pan­ta­leon Alvarez, one of Mr Duterte’s most pow­er­ful en­forcers whom she de­ri­sively called an “in­se­cure slob” and a “fat sleaze”.</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber last year, she was piv­otal in tak­ing down an­other Speaker, Mr Alan Cayetano, her fa­ther’s running mate in the 2016 elec­tion. (The pres­i­dent and vice-pres­i­dent are elected sep­a­rately in the Philip­pines; Mr Cayetano lost to the op­po­si­tion party leader Leni Ro­bredo, but he later man­aged to win a seat in the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives and had him­self en­sconced as Speaker.)</p>
    <p>NOT KING­MAKER BUT QUEEN</p>
    <p>Few peo­ple doubt that next only to her fa­ther, Ms Duterte-Car­pio is the Philip­pines’ most pow­er­ful politi­cian. It is not just be­cause she is Mr Duterte’s daugh­ter – she is a po­lit­i­cal force on her own.</p>
    <p>In the 2019 mid-term elec­tions, she suc­cess­fully steered a loose coalition of seven po­lit­i­cal par­ties al­lied with her fa­ther to a land­slide vic­tory in the closely watched Se­nate race. Not a sin­gle op­po­si­tion can­di­date won a seat in the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>That mighty coalition is ex­pected to, again, come to­gether once Mr Duterte of­fi­cially anoints Ms Duterte-Car­pio as his suc­ces­sor. Not even boxing champ Manny Pac­quiao or for­mer sen­a­tor Fer­di­nand Mar­cos Jr – name­sake of the late dic­ta­tor – who are both in­ter­ested in running for pres­i­dent are ex­pected to stand in her way.</p>
    <p>The Pulse Asia poll showed that 26 per cent of Filipino adults would sup­port Ms Duterte-Car­pio, fol­lowed by Mr Mar­cos and Sen­a­tor Grace Poe, both at 14 per cent, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno (12 per cent), and Mr Pac­quiao (10 per cent).</p>
    <p>Un­less she de­cides to stay in Davao or a tragedy be­falls her, Ms Duterte-Car­pio is, for now, the pres­i­dent-in-wait­ing. “She’s not just a king­maker, she wants to be the queen, too,” po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Ra­mon Casi­ple from the In­sti­tute for Po­lit­i­cal and Elec­toral Re­form told re­portr, an on­line news site.</p>
    <p>The US and China, there­fore, are watch­ing her ev­ery move.</p>
    <p>CHINA’S PLAY</p>
    <p>China has been do­ing what it does best: pour­ing money to fur­ther buoy Davao’s econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Top Chi­nese com­mu­nist party of­fi­cials running the in­dus­trial pow­er­houses of Chongqing, Guangxi, Fu­jian and Hainan have made a bee­line to work out in­vest­ment, trade, in­fra­struc­ture and tourism agree­ments with Ms Duterte-Car­pio.</p>
    <p>China is a ma­jor buyer of Davao’s main ex­ports: co­conuts and tuna. In 2019, be­fore the pan­demic, some two mil­lion tourists from the main­land vis­ited Davao City.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber last year, China agreed to pro­vide a US$60 mil­lion (S$80 mil­lion) loan to build a four-lane, 477m-long bridge over a river in Davao. China also has pledges to bankroll a US$478 mil­lion ex­press­way and a US$689 mil­lion rail­way.</p>
    <p>These have cer­tainly earned brownie points for Bei­jing with Ms Duterte-Car­pio, and may even be enough to con­vince her to con­tinue set­ting aside the 2016 in­ter­na­tional tri­bunal rul­ing in favour of Manila after it chal­lenged</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s South China Sea claims.</p>
    <p>But if she does be­come pres­i­dent, she will have to deal with far more than the af­fairs of a city of 1.6 mil­lion. She will be in charge of a na­tion of more than 100 mil­lion, and part of that job is se­cur­ing the coun­try’s borders, from both do­mes­tic ter­ror­ists and ex­ter­nal threats.</p>
    <p>THE U.S. AD­VAN­TAGE</p>
    <p>This is where the Amer­i­cans hold the ad­van­tage, one that it can press to en­sure key de­fence pacts like the VFA will re­main in place.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines and the US are still joined at the hip when it comes to de­fence. Be­sides the VFA, the Philip­pines has two other se­cu­rity pacts with the US: the Mu­tual De­fence Treaty and the En­hanced De­fence Co­op­er­a­tion Agree­ment.</p>
    <p>The treaty, in ef­fect since 1951, re­quires the US to come to the Philip­pines’ aid in the event of an invasion. The agree­ment, signed in 2014, al­lows the ex­tended stay of US forces and au­tho­rises them to build and main­tain bar­racks and ware­houses as well as store de­fence equip­ment and weapons in­side five des­ig­nated Philip­pine mil­i­tary camps.</p>
    <p>Ms Duterte-Car­pio is also not as hos­tile to­wards the Amer­i­cans as her fa­ther, who has vowed never to set foot on US soil. She was in Washington in Jan­uary last year for a lead­er­ship pro­gramme spon­sored by the US State Depart­ment.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing that visit, she had a photo of her taken at the Jef­fer­son Me­mo­rial that she later posted on In­sta­gram. Her caption for that photo of­fers a peek into her think­ing.</p>
    <p>“I am not a pup­pet of any­one,” she said. “I am all Filipino. I have Ger­man-Amer­i­can an­ces­try. I am in love with Ja­pan. I sa­lute China. I adore Sin­ga­pore. I am fas­ci­nated by Korea. I look for­ward to Tai­wan. I am In­done­sia and Malaysia’s BFF. I long for the UAE and Qatar. I re­spect Iran. I miss Turkey. I want to go back to Is­rael. I bloody like the UK. So, get off my back.”</p>
    <p>Com­pared with her fa­ther’s pun­gent tirades against Amer­ica, those are com­fort­ing words for the US.</p>
    <p>Still, the US will have to tread lightly around her. Her fa­ther is fac­ing ac­cu­sa­tions of “crimes against hu­man­ity” be­fore the In­ter­na­tional Crim­i­nal Court for his bloody drug war that has re­port­edly left at least 8,000 peo­ple dead since 2016.</p>
    <p>The US may have to keep its dis­tance from this case or any other ef­forts to probe al­le­ga­tions of civil rights abuses against Mr Duterte, even though that cau­tion will likely clash with calls within the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion of Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den to hold into ac­count strong­men like Mr Duterte.</p>
    <p>But as things stand, it does not seem like pros­e­cut­ing Mr Duterte will be on Mr Bi­den’s agenda any time soon, giv­ing diplo­mats in Manila and Washington time to fo­cus on more pro­duc­tive, less dis­rup­tive agenda items like trade and pan­demic re­lief, the VFA, and even re­sum­ing joint US-Philip­pine mil­i­tary ex­er­cises in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>WILD CARD</p>
    <p>There is a wild card in this sce­nario: Vice-Pres­i­dent Ro­bredo, the leader of the op­po­si­tion party. If she is elected pres­i­dent next year, she is ex­pected to bring re­la­tions be­tween the Philip­pines and the US back to where it was when Mr Benigno Aquino was pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>That means a hard pivot back to the US, and a dis­man­tling of Mr Duterte’s pro-China poli­cies. That also means Manila will press hard the case it won on the South China Sea to check what she sees as China’s ter­ri­to­rial over­reach.</p>
    <p>Luck­ily for Bei­jing, she is bring­ing up the rear in pres­i­den­tial sur­veys, pulling in just 8 per cent in the lat­est Pulse Asia poll. But her al­lies and some an­a­lysts say it is still too early to make a call.</p>
    <p>Ms Duterte-Car­pio “is al­ready a power to reckon with. But… it’s too early to say that what­ever she’s do­ing right now is enough to cat­a­pult her as a suc­cess­ful pres­i­den­tial can­di­date”, said Pro­fes­sor Den­nis Corona­cio, head of the po­lit­i­cal sci­ence depart­ment at the Univer­sity of Santo To­mas.</p>
    <p>For one thing, if his­tory is any in­di­ca­tion, can­di­dates who poll very well early in the race for pres­i­dent usu­ally run out of steam in the home stretch.</p>
    <p>But the “Duterte brand” seems like an aber­ra­tion in that it seems to defy his­tor­i­cal trends. Through­out his ten­ure as pres­i­dent so far, Mr Duterte’s pop­u­lar­ity has never waned, de­spite the wide­spread con­dem­na­tion of his drug war and per­sis­tent criticism of his han­dling of the econ­omy and the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>For Ms Duterte-Car­pio, the main chal­lenge now is keep­ing the coalition she led in 2019 in­tact. That may be­come a prob­lem if Mr Mar­cos or Mr Pac­quiao man­ages to nar­row her lead in the polls and emerge as a vi­able can­di­date. That will split her fa­ther’s base, and pro­vide an open­ing for the op­po­si­tion’s Ms Ro­bredo.</p>
    <p>The ex­pec­ta­tion, though, is that as the race heats up and se­ri­ous chal­lengers emerge, her fa­ther will step in and put the en­tire weight of his po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal be­hind her. That will seal the deal for her, giv­ing the Philip­pines an­other Duterte as ruler for six more years.</p>
