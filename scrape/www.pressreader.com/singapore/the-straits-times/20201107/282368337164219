    <p>Sha (not her real name), 27, who has a tem­po­rary job as a tem­per­a­ture taker in a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm, hopes to land a bet­ter-pay­ing ad­min­is­tra­tive job af­ter her con­tract ends on Nov 30.</p>
    <p>But the mother of two, who has not used a com­puter for seven years, knows she has much to catch up on if she hopes to se­cure such a job, which would re­quire more ad­vanced skills on plat­forms such as Mi­crosoft Ex­cel.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause I have gone so long with­out a com­puter, I’m re­ally not that ex­pert (at us­ing it); I just know the ba­sics. Now it has all de­vel­oped so fast, (all the work) needs to be done with a com­puter,” said Sha, who dropped out of school in Sec­ondary 4 be­fore com­plet­ing her N lev­els. Her chil­dren are aged seven and 11.</p>
    <p>Be­fore her cur­rent job, she worked in cus­tomer ser­vice and as a re­cep­tion­ist.</p>
    <p>Though she wants to buy a lap­top to prac­tise her Mi­crosoft Of­fice skills in her free time, she said the price tag is too hefty for her and her hus­band, a pest con­trol worker.</p>
    <p>Adults, par­tic­u­larly those who are lower-in­come or who have care­giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties like Sha, should not be left out of the dis­cus­sion on dig­i­tal in­clu­sion, said ex­perts, who worry that they lack the time or ac­cess to re­sources to learn and nav­i­gate new dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>This could widen the skills gap be­tween blue- and white-col­lar pro­fes­sion­als, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Irene Ng of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) So­cial Ser­vice Re­search Cen­tre and De­part­ment of So­cial Work.</p>
    <p>She noted that re­search has shown how ac­cess to dig­i­tal de­vices in­creases dig­i­tal lit­er­acy. “If low-in­come in­di­vid­u­als can’t af­ford to own a com­puter, then how are they to close the gap with PMETs (pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians), who own and use com­put­ers ev­ery day?” she asked.</p>
    <p>Ms Fan­nie Lim, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of charity Daugh­ters of To­mor­row (DOT), said a num­ber of the charity’s clients, who are mostly low-in­come women, face bar­ri­ers in us­ing in­fo­comm tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>They may lack IT lit­er­acy as their pre­vi­ous jobs did not re­quire such skills, or be­cause they have not gone for IT skills train­ing since leav­ing school. Some women do not even know how to use a mouse, she said.</p>
    <p>To bridge the gap, some of DOT’s clients – in­clud­ing Sha – will be pro­gres­sively at­tend­ing IT lit­er­acy classes, with lap­tops loaned to those who need them.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Lim Sun Sun, who is head of hu­man­i­ties, arts and so­cial sci­ences at the Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign, noted that job hir­ing prac­tices have shifted on­line in the light of the pan</p>
    <p>demic – be it us­ing al­go­rithms to sieve out in­ap­pro­pri­ate re­sumes or con­duct­ing job in­ter­views vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>She is con­cerned that lower-in­come adults may be less aware of how their re­sumes must con­tain strate­gic search terms to avoid be­ing re­jected by ma­chine learnin­gen­abled can­di­date selec­tion pro­cesses. They may also not be pre­pared for dig­i­tal in­ter­views, which typ­i­cally re­quire “a cer­tain style of self-pre­sen­ta­tion”.</p>
    <p>That was an is­sue that Emy, 35, (not her real name) grap­pled with. Af­ter leav­ing her cus­tomer ser­vice job last year, she fi­nally landed a job in­ter­view in April, which had to be done over Zoom. Think­ing it was</p>
    <p>“just a video in­ter­view”, she did not dress in proper busi­ness at­tire for it.</p>
    <p>“I ended up bomb­ing the in­ter­view,” re­called Emy, who even­tu­ally se­cured an ad­min­is­tra­tive job af­ter get­ting ca­reer coach­ing from Im­age Mis­sion, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that helps low-in­come or dis­ad­van­taged women by pro­vid­ing ca­reer coach­ing and job in­ter­view prepa­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>“They re­minded me to pre­pare things that I never even thought about, like en­sur­ing I had a sta­ble In­ter­net con­nec­tion to do the in­ter­view, and to put my phone on a sta­ble sur­face so that it wouldn’t be shaky,” said Emy.</p>
    <p>Some clients may also lack the equip­ment to con­duct job searches or at­tend on­line cour­ses, noted a spokesman for Im­age Mis­sion.</p>
    <p>A sur­vey of 98 clients con­ducted in April found that while four in five of them have a mo­bile phone, al­most half do not have a desk­top or lap­top com­puter at home to use the In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>“This in­di­cates that many do not have an op­ti­mal ex­pe­ri­ence for writ­ing their re­sume, con­duct­ing on­line job searches, and at­tend­ing on­line train­ing or job in­ter­views,” said its spokesman.</p>
    <p>Sin­gle mother Diyanah (not her real name), who is work­ing part­time as a HR as­sis­tant while com­plet­ing a poly­tech­nic di­ploma in hu­man re­source man­age­ment, faced is­sues se­cur­ing a lap­top.</p>
    <p>Though her school of­fered a lap­top sub­sidy scheme, she said that stu­dents have to be un­der 25 years old to qual­ify. This ex­cluded Diyanah, who is 33. She even­tu­ally re­ceived one from Care Com­mu­nity Ser­vices So­ci­ety, a charity.</p>
    <p>“The lap­top is some­thing per­sonal to you. You don’t just use it for en­ter­tain­ment; it is also used for (writ­ing) doc­u­ments, for or­gan­is­ing your life, and to do ev­ery­thing you need to do at work and in school,” she said.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said less priv­i­leged house­holds tend to rely on mo­bile phones to ac­cess the In­ter­net in­stead of us­ing lap­tops or desk­top com­put­ers.</p>
    <p>Labour economist Wal­ter Th­e­seira noted that while smart­phones and the mo­bile In­ter­net are great for dig­i­tal con­sump­tion, these tools are poorly suited for “pro­duc­tion” – be it writ­ing a doc­u­ment or pre­par­ing a CV. Re­sults from such tools are markedly in­fe­rior to that pro­duced by com­put­ers, com­ing with “tell­tale prob­lems” like odd align­ment.</p>
    <p>“There­fore we should not mea­sure dig­i­tal in­clu­sion solely by whether some­one has a smart­phone and mo­bile In­ter­net,” he said.</p>
    <p>Just as how sec­ondary school stu­dents will now be pro­vided with a lap­top or tablet from next year, lap­tops should be built in as part of course ma­te­ri­als for ca­reer cour­ses and in­cluded in the com­pu­ta­tion for fi­nan­cial aid as well, or loaned out, said Prof Ng.</p>
    <p>Prof Th­e­seira said it is also im­por­tant to ex­am­ine whether the real chal­lenge faced by this group is the lack of the cor­rect tech­nol­ogy or de­vice, the lack of train­ing in the use of the de­vice or soft­ware, or the lack of skills re­quired for one to be pro­duc­tive when us­ing tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“If the real is­sue is the last type of prob­lem, more foun­da­tional train­ing may be re­quired,” he said.</p>
    <p>It is... im­por­tant to ex­am­ine whether the real chal­lenge faced by this group is the lack of the cor­rect tech­nol­ogy or de­vice, the lack of train­ing in the use of the de­vice or soft­ware, or the lack of skills re­quired for one to be pro­duc­tive when us­ing tech­nol­ogy.</p>
