    <p>Q What is the new hand­ball law for this sea­son?</p>
    <p>A Strictly speak­ing there is no “new” hand­ball law in the Premier League this sea­son. The Premier League is, how­ever, en­act­ing the same law and in­ter­pre­ta­tion of it that was seen across other Euro­pean leagues last sea­son. English of­fi­cials had pre­vi­ously taken a more lib­eral at­ti­tude to­wards that law.</p>
    <p>Q Why has it done that? A</p>
    <p>In July, world gov­ern­ing body Fifa took charge of mat­ters re­lat­ing to video as­sis­tant ref­eree (VAR) from the rule-mak­ing body, the In­ter­na­tional Football As­so­ci­a­tion Board (Ifab), and Fifa of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing for­mer Ital­ian ref­eree, Pier­luigi Col­lina, made it clear that all leagues should play by the same laws and in­ter­pre­ta­tions of them.</p>
    <p>Q So why did Ifab change the hand­ball law?</p>
    <p>A The old law stated that de­lib­er­ate han­dling of the ball, with hand or arm, was an of­fence. This was clearly a sub­jec­tive mat­ter in­volv­ing an as­sess­ment of in­tent and led to much ar­gu­ment over de­ci­sions. The changes were an at­tempt to re­duce the sub­jec­tiv­ity and put the fo­cus on what Ifab calls “fac­tual” as­pects – such as the po­si­tion of the arm, which can be as­sessed through video re­view.</p>
    <p>Q How has this worked? A</p>
    <p>We have seen hand­ball de­ci­sions in the Premier League that were un­likely to have been given pre­vi­ously. For ex­am­ple, Eric Dier’s of­fence for Tot­ten­ham against New­cas­tle on Sun­day when he had his back turned to an op­po­nent while he jumped and the ball was headed against his out­stretched arm. Play­ers have been pe­nalised for shots at close-range which have struck their arm in­vol­un­tar­ily.</p>
    <p>Q I thought it wasn’t a foul if the de­fender was close to the at­tacker?</p>
    <p>A That is the case only “if the hand/arm is close to the body and does not make the body un­nat­u­rally big­ger”.</p>
    <p>Q Doesn’t a player tend to raise his arms when he jumps for a header?</p>
    <p>A That has been ar­gued by some for­mer play­ers. The law, how­ever, states that the arms should not be raised above shoul­der level to avoid the risk of a hand­ball de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Q</p>
    <p>So if this is caus­ing con­tro­versy and more hand­ball penal­ties in Eng­land, what hap­pened when it was in­tro­duced else­where last sea­son?</p>
    <p>A The num­ber of penal­ties for hand­ball had al­ready in­creased with the in­tro­duc­tion of VAR. Yet last sea­son in Italy’s Serie A for ex­am­ple, the num­ber of hand­ball penal­ties rose from 37 to 57. In Spain, they rose from 35 to 48.</p>
    <p>Q There are calls for the law to be changed, is that likely?</p>
    <p>A Ifab has been will­ing to tweak and al­ter laws with in­creas­ing fre­quency, so some change can­not be ruled out, but with VAR now part of the game, they are un­likely to re­turn to the old law based purely on in­tent to han­dle.</p>
