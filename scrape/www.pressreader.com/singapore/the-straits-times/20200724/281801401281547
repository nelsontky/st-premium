    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Coro­n­avirus cases in the United States topped four mil­lion yes­ter­day, with over 2,600 new cases every hour on av­er­age, the high­est rate in the world, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally.</p>
    <p>In­fec­tions in Amer­ica have rapidly ac­cel­er­ated since the first case was de­tected on Jan 21.</p>
    <p>It took the US 98 days to reach one mil­lion cases. It took the coun­try 43 days to reach two mil­lion and then 27 days to reach three mil­lion. But it has taken the US only 16 days to reach four mil­lion cases – at a rate of 43 new cases a minute.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia has over­taken New York, the orig­i­nal epi­cen­tre of the US coro­n­avirus out­break, as the worst-hit state for cases, ac­cord­ing to the Reuters tally of county data.</p>
    <p>The over­all tally of cases in the most pop­u­lous US state rose by 12,112 on Wed­nes­day to more than 421,000, the big­gest sin­gle-day in­crease since the pan­demic started.</p>
    <p>Cal­i­for­nia deaths also set a one­day record, ris­ing by 159. New York has recorded by far the most deaths of any US state at more than 32,000, with Cal­i­for­nia in fourth place with over 8,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Texas on Wed­nes­day set one-day records for in­creases in Covid-19 deaths and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions in the state, forc­ing one county to store bodies in re­frig­er­ated trucks and prompt­ing a top health of­fi­cial there to call for new stay-at-home orders.</p>
    <p>Texas, which re­ported 197 deaths and 10,893 hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions that day, has been one of the states hard­est hit by the resur­gent coro­n­avirus. Hi­dalgo County, at the south­ern tip of the state along the US bor­der with Mexico, has seen cases rise by 60 per cent in the last week, ac­cord­ing to the Reuters tally, with deaths dou­bling to more than 360.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to lasso this virus, this stal­lion, bring the num­bers back down and get con­trol of this thing,” Hi­dalgo County Judge Richard</p>
    <p>Cortez said. “Be­cause our hos­pi­tals – they’re war zones, they are re­ally strug­gling right now.”</p>
    <p>Cre­ma­to­ri­ums in the Hi­dalgo area have a wait list of two weeks, Mr Cortez said, forc­ing the county to use five re­frig­er­ated trucks that can hold 50 bodies each.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a cafe­te­ria em­ployee who works in a build­ing where some White House staff have of­fices has tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus, re­ported NBC News.</p>
    <p>The White House is con­duct­ing con­tact trac­ing af­ter the worker in the Eisen­hower Ex­ec­u­tive Of­fice Build­ing, which is next to the White House, tested pos­i­tive, NBC News added.</p>
    <p>The fed­eral gov­ern­ment, state gov­er­nors and city lead­ers have of­ten clashed over the best way to tackle the pan­demic, lead­ing to a con­fus­ing patch­work of rules on is­sues like wear­ing masks in pub­lic and when busi­nesses can re­open.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump re­cently shifted his tone. He had pre</p>
    <p>It took the US 98 days to reach one mil­lion cases. It took the coun­try 43 days to reach two mil­lion and then 27 days to reach three mil­lion. But it has taken the US only 16 days to reach four mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>vi­ously been re­luc­tant to wear a mask but this week en­cour­aged Amer­i­cans to wear face cov­er­ings. He even ap­peared in pub­lic for the first time with a mask re­cently.</p>
    <p>Of the 20 coun­tries with the big­gest Covid-19 out­break, the US ranks sec­ond for cases per capita, at 120 in­fec­tions per 10,000 peo­ple, ex­ceeded only by Chile.</p>
    <p>With over 143,000 deaths, or 4.4 fa­tal­i­ties per 10,000 peo­ple, the US ranks sixth glob­ally for the most deaths per capita. It is ex­ceeded by the United King­dom, Spain, Italy, Chile and France.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the rate of new in­fec­tions shows no sign of slow­ing, with the dis­ease ac­cel­er­at­ing the fastest in the US and South Amer­ica, ac­cord­ing to the Reuters tally, based on of­fi­cial re­ports.</p>
    <p>Brazil reg­is­tered a new daily record for con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases on Wed­nes­day, push­ing the to­tal con­firmed cases across Latin Amer­ica past four mil­lion.</p>
