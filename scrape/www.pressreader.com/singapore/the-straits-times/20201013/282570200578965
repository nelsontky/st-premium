    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Your help is much needed. It is one of those days when you need to be sure your ac­tions are directed to­wards the right peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20) Your great per­sonal en­ergy makes oth­ers lean in close and try harder than usual to hear what you have to say.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>Try to catch up with your e-mail. Your en­ergy is some­what sti­fled and the only an­swer is to clear out some of the back­log.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>Your so­cial con­nec­tions are making life sweeter. Go to net­work­ing events or just chat up strangers as you are more com­pelling than ever.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Check out your bud­get. Your mind is ready to ab­sorb all the fi­nan­cial in­for­ma­tion and your soul can han­dle all the tiny de­tails.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You are leg­endary for your or­gan­i­sa­tional skills. Now is the time for you to show what you are made of and keep up the mo­men­tum.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>There is just way too much go­ing on. Try to pare back on cer­tain tasks so your sched­ule does not start to get over­whelm­ing.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>You are great at keep­ing se­crets, so much so that you may find a dear friend en­trust­ing you with a big one. Ac­cept it as an hon­our, not a bur­den.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) You have to be care­ful with your words – it is easy to of­fend the wrong per­son and you may have to backpedal re­ally quickly.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You have the right kind of men­tal en­ergy for a big meet­ing or job. Any­thing you dream up should work out well for ev­ery­one.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>While your ideas may not soar into the ether, you should be more in touch with your feel­ings and those of your friends.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>Project your­self in ac­tiv­i­ties – your voice, ac­tions and opin­ions need to be recog­nised. It is eas­ier than you think, even if it is awk­ward at first.</p>
