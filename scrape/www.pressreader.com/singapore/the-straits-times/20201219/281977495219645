    <p>LON­DON • The Euro­pean Union said yes­ter­day that there were just hours left to strike a Brexit trade deal, while Britain called on the bloc to see sense as the two sides race to pre­vent a tur­bu­lent fi­nale to the Brexit cri­sis at the end of the month.</p>
    <p>Both sides are de­mand­ing that the other com­pro­mise amid a flurry of of­ten-con­flict­ing mes­sages that vary from a deal is pos­si­ble, to a deal is in se­ri­ous trou­ble, to a deal is im­mi­nent.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral hours af­ter EU chief ne­go­tia­tor Michel Barnier told Lon­don that there were just hours left to nav­i­gate a nar­row path to­wards a deal, Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son said the Bri­tish door was open, adding that the EU should see sense and com­pro­mise.</p>
    <p>“It’s the mo­ment of truth,” Mr Barnier told the Euro­pean Par­lia­ment in Brus­sels. “There is a chance of get­ting an agree­ment, but the path to such an agree­ment is very nar­row.”</p>
    <p>Mr John­son said Britain would keep talk­ing, but he would not com­pro­mise on tak­ing back con­trol of its laws and its fishing waters – which he sees as the fun­da­men­tal point of leav­ing the EU.</p>
    <p>He told re­porters: “We hope that our EU friends will see sense and come to the ta­ble with some­thing them­selves – be­cause that’s re­ally where we are.”</p>
    <p>Britain for­mally left on Jan 31 af­ter its 2016 ref­er­en­dum, but it has been in a tran­si­tion pe­riod un­der which rules on trade, travel and busi­ness re­main un­changed. That pe­riod ends on Dec 31.</p>
    <p>An ac­cord would en­sure that the goods trade which makes up half of an­nual EU-UK com­merce, worth nearly US$1 tril­lion (S$1.33 tril­lion) in all, would re­main free of tar­iffs and quo­tas.</p>
    <p>Ster­ling fell yes­ter­day, re­vers­ing some of its re­cent gains, af­ter Mr Barnier’s warn­ing of time run­ning out to reach the trade deal.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish cur­rency is still on track for its best week since the end of July as mar­ket con­fi­dence has risen sharply this week on hopes that a last-minute trade deal would be reached.</p>
    <p>The pound hit 21/ year highs, 2 above US$1.36, this week, but yes­ter­day’s trad­ing ses­sion served as a re­minder that the two sides still have di­ver­gent ideas on how they want to build their post-Brexit re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Britain says the talks are stuck on two is­sues – the so-called level play­ing field and fishing – and has re­peat­edly said the EU has to budge or there will be no deal.</p>
    <p>“We have very lit­tle time re­main­ing, j ust a few hours to work through th­ese ne­go­ti­a­tions in a use­ful fash­ion if we want this agree­ment to en­ter into force on Jan 1,” Mr Barnier said.</p>
    <p>For fish­eries, he said the bloc also wanted to be free to re­tal­i­ate by curb­ing mar­ket ac­cess to UK fish prod­ucts – should Britain squeeze Euro­pean ships out of its waters.</p>
    <p>Mr John­son por­trays Brexit as a chance to build a fully in­de­pen­dent Bri­tish econ­omy that would be much more ag­ile than its com­peti­tors, and so does not want to be tied to the EU’s or­bit and its rules for years to come.</p>
    <p>Britain’s big­gest busi­ness lobby group called on the EU to de­lay in­tro­duc­ing new cus­toms checks af­ter Brexit be­cause firms have not had enough prepa­ra­tion time ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Con­fed­er­a­tion of Bri­tish Industry, which rep­re­sents 190,000 busi­nesses, is also ask­ing for com­pa­nies to be given a grace pe­riod to com­ply with new pa­per­work that will be re­quired at the end of the year whether or not a trade deal is reached.</p>
    <p>TIME RUN­NING OUT</p>
    <p>We have very lit­tle time re­main­ing, just a few hours to work through th­ese ne­go­ti­a­tions in a use­ful fash­ion if we want this agree­ment to en­ter into force on Jan 1.</p>
    <p>EU CHIEF NE­GO­TIA­TOR MICHEL BARNIER</p>
