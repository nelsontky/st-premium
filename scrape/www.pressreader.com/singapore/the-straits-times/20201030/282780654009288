    <p>I long for the day when mask wear­ing is a thing of the past.</p>
    <p>How we used to take fresh air for granted! These days, even when I am not thirsty, I sip from my wa­ter bot­tle for the briefest chance to breathe un­en­cum­bered.</p>
    <p>So it is with some ap­pre­hen­sion that I pull on the Un­der Ar­mour Sports­mask for a work­out.</p>
    <p>It is touted as of­fer­ing bet­ter air­flow, a se­cure yet com­fort­able fit and in­ner­most fab­ric that is both cool­ing and an­timi­cro­bial. The nose wire is mold­able with­out be­ing rigid and the soft straps are gen­tle on my ears.</p>
    <p>The whole thing feels thick and plush, like wear­ing a pil­low on my face. Cer­tainly com­fort­able if I want to lay on my cheek for a nap, but will I be smoth­ered dur­ing a work­out?</p>
    <p>I start with a low-im­pact, be­gin­ner-friendly out­door yoga class, where mask-wear­ing is not manda­tory.</p>
    <p>Within the first 15 min­utes, I spot the first droplets of per­spi­ra­tion on my mat while hold­ing a plank pose. Even so, breath­ing comes easy. The struc­tured de­sign means my lips and nos­trils never once graze the in­side of the mask. In­hal­ing is close to ef­fort­less.</p>
    <p>When the hour is up, I even have to re­mind my­self to re­move the mask dur­ing savasana, or the fi­nal rest­ing pose.</p>
    <p>So far, so com­fort­able. I amp it up with a high-in­ten­sity in­ter­val train­ing work­out from the Nike Train­ing Club app.</p>
    <p>Again, the mask feels great dur­ing a low-im­pact warm-up, and even dur­ing bi­cy­cle crunches and oblique twists dur­ing the core­fo­cused com­po­nent.</p>
    <p>But when ply­o­met­rics, or jump train­ing, kicks in, it be­comes harder to catch my breath. Brief spells be­tween sets of jump squats and jump­ing lunges – meant for rest – be­come a race to slow my pound­ing heart.</p>
    <p>The air grows warmer with each ex­hale. Fi­nally, I give in and re­move the mask. Sweet re­lief.</p>
    <p>As a com­par­i­son, I do the same work­out with the first re­us­able fab­ric mask is­sued by the Gov­ern­ment in April. Al­though flat and much thinner, it plas­ters to my nos­trils and mouth and my breath­ing grows even more laboured. I last all of five min­utes be­fore pulling off the mask.</p>
    <p>At $35, the Un­der Ar­mour Sports­mask does not come cheap, but far out­per­forms masks that are not made for sports.</p>
    <p>It is a wor­thy in­vest­ment for an added sense of se­cu­rity as gyms and fit­ness classes grow more crowded, or while do­ing semistren­u­ous ac­tiv­i­ties such as rock climb­ing, where a mask is man­dated.</p>
    <p>Per­haps, like me, you might also for­get to take it off when you’re done.</p>
    <p>The Un­der Ar­mour Sports­mask will be avail­able at un­der­ar­mour.com.sg and at stores from next Fri­day.</p>
