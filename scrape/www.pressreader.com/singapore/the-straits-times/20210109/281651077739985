    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Deep in­side the United States Capi­tol, gun­shots rang out­side the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives as a hand­ful of se­cu­rity of­fi­cers in­side the cham­ber scram­bled to pile fur­ni­ture against the doors to keep out the surg­ing crowd.</p>
    <p>In­side, con­gress­men and women cow­ered, strug­gling to put on gas marks that were stored un­der their seats.</p>
    <p>It was un­prece­dented for the heart of Amer­i­can democ­racy. Ques­tions are mount­ing over the se­cu­rity fail­ure that al­lowed thou­sands of Trump sup­port­ers to storm the build­ing on Wed­nes­day, with hun­dreds forc­ing their way in, smash­ing win­dows and van­dal­is­ing of­fices.</p>
    <p>An un­known num­ber of pa­pers and at least one law­maker’s lap­top were stolen as the crowd ram­paged through of­fices. One per­son walked off proudly car­ry­ing Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s lectern.</p>
    <p>News pho­tog­ra­phers were as­saulted, and “Mur­der the me­dia” was scrawled on a door in the build­ing. On Thurs­day, Capi­tol Po­lice chief Steven Sund re­signed, as did the Sergeants-at-Arms for the Se­nate and House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives.</p>
    <p>Even with ad­vance news of the rally and open chat­ter in on­line fo­rums that the Capi­tol was a tar­get, se­cu­rity was far lighter than at events such as the Black Lives Mat­ter protests last sum­mer. The con­trast, and irony, were hard to miss.</p>
    <p>“We spend US$750 bil­lion (S$992 bil­lion) on de­fence and the Pen­tagon, and we… couldn’t con­trol an in­sur­rec­tion in the US Capi­tol,” Demo­cratic con­gress­woman Pramila Jaya­pal said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>As many as 60 Capi­tol Po­lice of­fi­cers were in­jured in the may­hem, many hit on the head with lead pipes. At least 15 had to be hos­pi­talised. On Thurs­day, one died.</p>
    <p>Capi­tol Po­lice are some 2,000-strong, but with­out ad­di­tional crowd-con­trol re­sources, they were ut­terly over­whelmed.</p>
    <p>With­out back-up, the only way to stop a crowd of thou­sands would have been to shoot at them – so the po­lice, while re­sist­ing to the point of hand-to-hand fight­ing in the halls and cor­ri­dors of the hal­lowed build­ing, had to give way.</p>
    <p>Still, one Trump sup­porter, a woman iden­ti­fied as Ms Ashli Bab­bitt, was fa­tally shot by a Capi­tol Po­lice of­fi­cer. An­other woman and two men died dur­ing the may­hem be­cause of heart at­tacks and strokes.</p>
    <p>But some videos cir­cu­lat­ing on­line ap­pear to show one Capi­tol Po­lice of­fi­cer tak­ing self­ies with the mob. And a Wash­ing­ton Metro po­lice of­fi­cer in a public Face­book post wrote that among the ri­ot­ers were off-duty po­lice of­fi­cers and mem­bers of the mil­i­tary who flashed their badges and iden­tity cards as they over­ran the build­ing.</p>
    <p>Adding to the con­cern, Pen­tagon of­fi­cials said on Thurs­day that Capi­tol Po­lice ear­lier turned down an of­fer of ad­di­tional Na­tional Guard troops. Re­in­force­ments ar­rived only af­ter 2pm, af­ter Act­ing De­fence Sec­re­tary Chris Miller called up 1,100 mem­bers of the Wash­ing­ton Na­tional Guard. Later, around 6pm, the gov­er­nor of neigh­bour­ing Vir­ginia rushed in ad­di­tional Na­tional Guard troops.</p>
    <p>Even Repub­li­can Sen­a­tor Lind­sey Graham, a Trump ally, noted that there was bet­ter pro­tec­tion in place dur­ing Black Lives Mat­ter marches last year.</p>
    <p>“Any­one in charge of de­fend­ing the Capi­tol failed their du­ties. If they would have been in the mil­i­tary, they would have been re­lieved of their com­mands and most likely court-mar­tialled,” Mr Graham said.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, who spent 36 years in the Se­nate, said in a video state­ment: “No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Mat­ter (pro­test­ers) yes­ter­day, they wouldn’t have been treated very, very dif­fer­ently than the mob of thugs that stormed the Capi­tol. We all know that is true, and it is un­ac­cept­able.”</p>
    <p>Pho­to­graphs of the pro-Trump mob re­veal sev­eral who seemed to have come with clear in­tent. One re­vealed a man with plas­tic ties of the sort po­lice use to hand­cuff peo­ple. Capi­tol Po­lice did make 14 ar­rests, in­clud­ing a 70-year-old man from Alabama who they said had a gun and ma­te­ri­als for Molo­tov cock­tails.</p>
    <p>Ari­zona congressma­n Ruben Gal­lego, a Demo­crat, told Politico: “If this were an or­gan­ised, fully in­tent ter­ror­ist group – and there were cer­tainly ter­ror­ist ac­tiv­i­ties yes­ter­day, but I mean, Al-Qaeda style – they could have killed a lot of rep­re­sen­ta­tives and god knows what else.”</p>
    <p>Mr Malcolm Nance, a na­tional se­cu­rity an­a­lyst, told ra­dio sta­tion WBUR that Capi­tol Po­lice should be in­ves­ti­gated for po­ten­tial com­plic­ity. “We saw this com­ing a long time ago,” he said.</p>
