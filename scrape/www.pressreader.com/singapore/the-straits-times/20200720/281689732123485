    <p>The newly elected Sengkang GRC MPs from the Work­ers’ Party (WP) have in­formed the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment (MND) that they in­tend to run the new Sengkang Town Coun­cil on its own, with­out merg­ing with any other con­stituency.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day to up­date res­i­dents on de­vel­op­ments, WP’s Sengkang team leader He Ting Ru also said she would chair the new town coun­cil.</p>
    <p>She noted that her team had writ­ten to both Ang Mo Kio Town Coun­cil (AMKTC) and Pasir Ris-Pung­gol Town Coun­cil (PRPTC) on July 11 to re­quest a pre­lim­i­nary meet­ing to dis­cuss the han­dover.</p>
    <p>The An­chor­vale ward in the new</p>
    <p>GRC is cur­rently man­aged by AMKTC, while the Pung­gol East and Sengkang Cen­tral ar­eas are over­seen by PRPTC.</p>
    <p>Last Wed­nes­day, the WP team made a spe­cific re­quest for copies of the con­tracts for man­ag­ing agent ser­vices and use of town coun­cil man­age­ment soft­ware to be pro­vided to them as soon as pos­si­ble, Ms He said.</p>
    <p>“PRPTC, whom we un­der­stand to be co­or­di­nat­ing the han­dover with AMKTC, sug­gested a vir­tual meet­ing on Fri­day, July 17,” she added.</p>
    <p>The lawyer said her team re­peated their re­quest for copies of the con­tracts at the vir­tual meet­ing last Fri­day. They also asked for an in-per­son meet­ing soon to fur­ther dis­cuss the han­dover and get a brief­ing on op­er­a­tional mat­ters re­lat­ing to both town coun­cils. added. “Our ini­tial con­tact had been through in­di­vid­u­als who were not the elected SKTC mem­bers, and we had re­quested that the dis­cus­sion should be with the SKTC chair­man and duly ap­pointed team.”</p>
    <p>He said the mat­ter was sorted out at last Fri­day’s vir­tual meet­ing ar­ranged by the Alju­nied-Hougang Town Coun­cil (AHTC) and at­tended by Ms He, her fel­low Sengkang GRC MP Louis Chua, WP chair­man Sylvia Lim, for­mer Hougang MP Png Eng Huat and an AHTC staff mem­ber.</p>
    <p>“Ms He e-mailed us on July 18 con­firm­ing the point of con­tact for the process. We have replied to con­firm that we will pro­vide her with the re­quested ma­te­rial on Mon­day, July 20,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The SKTC team were not ready to re­ceive the brief­ing that we of­fered at the meet­ing on July 17, but we look for­ward to dis­cussing the is­sues at the in-per­son meet­ing on July 23.”</p>
    <p>Ms He, 37, had led a team com­pris­ing eco­nomics pro­fes­sor Ja­mus Lim, 44, so­cial en­ter­prise founder Raeesah Khan, 26, and eq­uity re­search an­a­lyst Louis Chua, 33, to vic­tory in the July 10 polls, with 52.12 per cent of the votes in Sengkang.</p>
    <p>In an­other Face­book post last night, Ms He an­nounced the di­vi­sion of MPs in the GRC, and de­tails of Meet-the-Peo­ple Ses­sions. She is the MP for Buangkok ward in Sengkang. As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim takes charge of An­chor­vale, with Ms Raeesah and Mr Chua over­see­ing Com­pass­vale and River­vale re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Ms He also noted that some Sengkang res­i­dents have been call­ing the AHTC to re­port es­tate mat­ters.</p>
    <p>She told res­i­dents that they should still re­port es­tate mat­ters and pay ser­vice and con­ser­vancy charges to AMKTC and PRPTC un­til fur­ther no­tice, as these town coun­cils are still in charge of man­ag­ing the HDB es­tates in Sengkang.</p>
