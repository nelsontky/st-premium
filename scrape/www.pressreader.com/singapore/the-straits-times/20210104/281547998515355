    <p>na­tion re­sults – for se­condary school leavers, the O-level re­sults are likely to be re­leased next week.</p>
    <p>The EAE is an ap­ti­tude-based ad­mis­sions ex­er­cise that al­lows stu­dents to ap­ply for and re­ceive con­di­tional of­fers for ad­mis­sion to poly­tech­nics be­fore they get their fi­nal grades. Ap­pli­cants are usu­ally re­quired to un­dergo in­ter­views and take ap­ti­tude tests as part of the se­lec­tion process.</p>
    <p>First in­tro­duced in 2016, the EAE is part of a con­certed move by MOE to recog­nise stu­dents’ achieve­ments be­yond aca­demic grades at the ter­tiary level, span­ning across the ITE, poly­tech­nics and uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
    <p>From an ini­tial in­take guide­line of just 2.5 per cent, the min­istry pro­gres­sively raised the fig­ure to 12.5 per cent, 15 per cent, and then to 20 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>MOE also said about 430 work­ing adults ap­plied via the polytech­nic EAE for ad­mis­sion in the 2021 aca­demic year, of whom 50 got of­fers.</p>
    <p>Since 2019, the ex­er­cise has been opened up to work­ing adults to ex­pand polytech­nic ad­mis­sion path­ways for them. Gen­er­ally, they need at least two years of work ex­pe­ri­ence and must meet the course re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Polytech­nic of­fi­cials wel­comed the fact that more stu­dents are tak­ing ad­van­tage of the scheme.</p>
    <p>Te­masek Polytech­nic prin­ci­pal Peter Lam said: “The early, ap­ti­tude-based ad­mis­sions scheme has worked well in al­low­ing more poros­ity across path­ways and en­cour­ag­ing our young peo­ple to pur­sue their pas­sion and in­ter­ests.”</p>
    <p>He said in se­lect­ing stu­dents, the poly­tech­nics take into ac­count the full range of an in­di­vid­ual’s ap­ti­tude and at­tributes.</p>
    <p>“Gen­er­ally, stu­dents who have come through this ad­mis­sions ex­er­cise have a clear idea of their pas­sion and strengths. They tend to do well in their cour­ses, even if their O-level re­sults might not have given them the op­por­tu­nity to pur­sue the course.”</p>
    <p>He said about 1,000 stu­dents have been ac­cepted into Te­masek Polytech­nic this year via the EAE.</p>
    <p>Among the cour­ses most in de­mand are those re­lated to IT, de­sign and early child­hood ed­u­ca­tion, as well as culi­nary cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Repub­lic Polytech­nic (RP) prin­ci­pal Yeo Li Pheow said that with each pass­ing year, more are ap­ply­ing for places through the scheme and those who get in are driven to achieve good out­comes.</p>
    <p>He said that al­though the se­lec­tion in­ter­views and port­fo­lio as­sess­ments were con­ducted on­line last year be­cause of the pan­demic, the stu­dents, be­ing dig­i­tal na­tives, took to the for­mat quite well.</p>
    <p>RP of­fered 1,123 places to Olevel and ITE ap­pli­cants. Cour­ses re­lated to sports, bio­med­i­cal sci­ence and avi­a­tion man­age­ment were the top choices.</p>
    <p>Aileen Tan, 17, who got an of­fer to study de­sign at Te­masek Polytech­nic, de­scribed the EAE as a “god­send”. “I don’t think I will be able to get into the course at Te­masek based on my re­sults alone. I’m glad that I was able to show my en­thu­si­asm and tal­ent in the field through my port­fo­lio and in­ter­view.”</p>
    <p>Aside from the Joint Ad­mis­sions Ex­er­cise, the route that most stu­dents take to get into poly­tech­nics, there are other pro­cesses that al­low stu­dents to take dif­fer­ent paths to diploma pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>1. The Polytech­nic Early Ad­mis­sions Ex­er­cise (EAE)</p>
    <p>The EAE is an ap­ti­tude-based ad­mis­sions ex­er­cise in which stu­dents ap­ply to and re­ceive con­di­tional of­fers from poly­tech­nics be­fore re­ceiv­ing their fi­nal grades.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE ) web­site, each polytech­nic has its own se­lec­tion cri­te­ria, tak­ing into ac­count in­ter­est and ap­ti­tude through sub­mit­ted port­fo­lios, in­ter­views and tests.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents can ap­ply from var­i­ous ed­u­ca­tional routes.</p>
    <p>O-level stu­dents and stu­dents from the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion (ITE) will re­ceive con­di­tional of­fers be­fore their fi­nal grades are re­leased and must meet the re­quire­ments of the of­fers.</p>
    <p>The scheme is also open to work­ing adults who are Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zens or per­ma­nent res­i­dents with at least two years of rel­e­vant work ex­pe­ri­ence and meet the course re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>2. The Di­rect En­try Scheme to Polytech­nic Pro­gramme (DPP)</p>
    <p>The DPP scheme al­lows stu­dents to go straight from N lev­els to ITE and on to polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents who ap­ply for the DPP pro­gramme first en­rol in ITE to do a Higher Nitec cer­tifi­cate be­fore mov­ing on to a polytech­nic diploma if they meet the grades.</p>
    <p>This al­lows stu­dents to skip fin­ish­ing a Nitec cer­tifi­cate be­fore get­ting the Higher Nitec.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents can ap­ply for the DPP with their N-level re­sults or their pre­lim­i­nary O-level re­sults, or a com­bi­na­tion of their N-level and O-level re­sults.</p>
    <p>Suc­cess­ful ap­pli­cants en­rol in ITE for a 10-week prepara­tory course in Jan­uary be­fore join­ing the Higher Nitec course in April.</p>
    <p>3 The Polytech­nic Foun­da­tion Pro­gramme (PFP)</p>
    <p>The PFP is a one-year foun­da­tional pro­gramme run by the var­i­ous poly­tech­nics as an al­ter­na­tive to the Se­condary 5 year for “Nor­mal” aca­demic stu­dents.</p>
    <p>It is taught by polytech­nic lec­tur­ers and pre­pares stu­dents for en­try into their cho­sen cour­ses.</p>
    <p>It is taught over two polytech­nic semesters and stu­dents must pass all their PFP mod­ules to move on to the first year of their cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents can ap­ply with their N-level and O-level re­sults.</p>
