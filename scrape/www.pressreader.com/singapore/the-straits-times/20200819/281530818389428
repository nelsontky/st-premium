    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has vowed to cre­ate 10 mil­lion jobs in 10 months, in part by set­ting up tax cred­its for US com­pa­nies that re­lo­cate man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­i­ties to the United States from China. He also pre­dicted the US econ­omy would bounce back strongly from the Covid-19 pan­demic – as long as he is re-elected. WORLD</p>
    <p>MIN­NESOTA/WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has vowed to cre­ate 10 mil­lion jobs in 10 months, in part by set­ting up tax cred­its for US com­pa­nies that re­lo­cate man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­i­ties to the United States from China.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, seek­ing to build sup­port ahead of the Nov 3 elec­tion, told sup­port­ers dur­ing a visit to Mankato, Min­nesota on Mon­day his ad­min­is­tra­tion would also strip fed­eral con­tracts from com­pa­nies that out­sourced work to China.</p>
    <p>“We will cre­ate tax cred­its for com­pa­nies that bring j obs from China back to Amer­ica,” Mr Trump said dur­ing an hour-long speech.</p>
    <p>He also pre­dicted the US econ­omy would bounce back strongly from the eco­nomic shock caused by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic – as long as he was re-elected.</p>
    <p>“What we’re do­ing to­gether is noth­ing short of an eco­nomic mir­a­cle and now we’re do­ing it again,” Mr Trump told cheer­ing sup­port­ers. “We built the great­est econ­omy in the his­tory of the world and now I have to do it again.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump hailed in­creased re­tail sales in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>But data re­leased last week showed US re­tail sales in­creased less than ex­pected last month as con­sumers cut back on pur­chases of mo­tor ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>They could slow fur­ther in the months ahead amid spi­ralling new Covid-19 in­fec­tions and a cut in un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fit cheques.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is tak­ing ac­tion on mul­ti­ple fronts to re­bal­ance US eco­nomic ties with China, in­clud­ing through re­stric­tions on Chi­nese firms like tech­nol­ogy gi­ant Huawei, bans on pop­u­lar apps like TikTok, and a spate of ex­ec­u­tive or­ders aimed at en­sur­ing do­mes­tic pro­duc­tion of key prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>At the time, the ad­min­is­tra­tion is us­ing “Buy Amer­ica” re­quire­ments and in­cen­tives to per­suade US firms to bol­ster do­mes­tic sup­ply chains, es­pe­cially for crit­i­cal sup­plies, such as drugs and med­i­cal equip­ment.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent, who is trail­ing pre­sump­tive Demo­cratic nom­i­nee Joe Bi­den in opin­ion polls, said his tax cuts and other mea­sures were strength­en­ing the US econ­omy de­spite the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said the ad­min­is­tra­tion planned fur­ther tax cuts, and re­duc­tions in reg­u­la­tions to en­cour­age more in­vest­ment at home, but gave no spe­cific de­tails.</p>
    <p>“We will end our reliance on China, we will make our crit­i­cal drugs and sup­plies right here in the United States,” he said, in an ap­par­ent ref­er­ence to an ex­ec­u­tive or­der signed last month to boost pro­duc­tion of medicines and med­i­cal equip­ment.</p>
    <p>A whole host of US prod­ucts are made over­seas for con­sumers back home in Amer­ica, a busi­ness strat­egy known as out­sourc­ing.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a num­ber of global brands are now re­view­ing their op­er­a­tions in China amid the pan­demic, with tem­po­rary fac­tory clo­sures caus­ing ma­jor sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions.</p>
    <p>China is well known as the “world’s fac­tory”, due to its large man­u­fac­tur­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the coun­try’s share of global ex­ports has been bat­tered by the trade dis­pute with the US and the pan­demic.</p>
