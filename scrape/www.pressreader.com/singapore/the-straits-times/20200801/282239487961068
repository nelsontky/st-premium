    <p>Should schools place more em­pha­sis on char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion (CCE) classes?</p>
    <p>Yes, no doubt about it. Schools should work with par­ents in CCE to in­cul­cate in our chil­dren (the abil­ity) to be­come more re­silient to chal­lenges and more gra­cious to so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>Nel­lie Lim</p>
    <p>Stu­dents should be taught how to be re­spect­ful and obe­di­ent. They should also be taught how to help oth­ers and the el­derly.</p>
    <p>Emily Tan</p>
    <p>Par­ents are the best teach­ers. If CCE were an ex­am­inable sub­ject, then maybe par­ents would look into it more than aca­demic re­sults and top schools.</p>
    <p>Con­nie Tay</p>
    <p>In Ja­pan, schools don’t have jan­i­tors and stu­dents clean ev­ery­thing them­selves. But in Sin­ga­pore, ev­ery par­ent treats his child like an em­peror. If par­ents can’t teach their chil­dren cor­rect be­hav­iour, why push it to schools?</p>
    <p>Don De Voy Tan</p>
    <p>Char­ac­ter can­not be taught by books. It is built through ex­pe­ri­ences along with guid­ance from those that lead by ex­am­ple. It’s also af­fected by the sys­tem/en­vi­ron­ment. If the sys­tem em­pha­sises aca­demic per­for­mance and separates stu­dents ac­cord­ingly, how will the strong learn hu­mil­ity by help­ing the weak?</p>
    <p>Maybe one stu­dent is weak in math­e­mat­ics but strong in phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion. Only if we al­low stu­dents to study and play to­gether will they learn how to be in­clu­sive and sup­port one an­other.</p>
    <p>Cather­ine Dee</p>
    <p>Man­ners and val­ues must be taught at home. Schools are there just to re­in­force them, not to take over the teach­ing of them.</p>
    <p>Nunu Ben­net</p>
    <p>Schools should never have to re­place par­ents.</p>
    <p>Shaun Foo</p>
    <p>Why is it that learn­ing how to be­come a de­cent hu­man be­ing even needs to be taught as a “sub­ject”?</p>
    <p>Leonard Low</p>
    <p>It’s not ex­am­inable and does not af­fect a teacher’s key per­for­mance in­di­ca­tors, so all the books go into the bin.</p>
