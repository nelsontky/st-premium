    <p>Uefa used Thurs­day’s Su­per Cup game be­tween Bay­ern Mu­nich and Sevilla in Bu­da­pest as a trial run to see if foot­ball can be played in front of live au­di­ences again. Some 15,500 fans were at the 67,000-seat Puskas Sta­dium to watch Bay­ern win 2-1. It was the first ma­jor Euro­pean club game to al­low sup­port­ers since foot­ball re­turned. SPORT</p>
    <p>BU­DA­PEST • For Bay­ern Mu­nich fan Sven Wid­mann, it was worth driv­ing to Bu­da­pest just to watch the Cham­pi­ons League win­ners play in Thurs­day’s Uefa Su­per Cup, the first Euro­pean game played with some fans in the stands since the sport re­turned amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“My last game at the sta­dium was in March,” said Wid­mann, sport­ing a new Bay­ern jersey and smil­ing broadly at Bu­da­pest’s 67,000-seat Puskas Sta­dium be­hind his face mask.</p>
    <p>As a pi­lot project to al­low fans to re­turn, around 15,500 fans watched the con­test in Bu­da­pest, which proved con­tro­ver­sial since the Ger­man gov­ern­ment classed the Hun­gar­ian cap­i­tal a risk zone.</p>
    <p>“We all know that it is not easy, es­pe­cially with this (health) sit­u­a­tion, to make good de­ci­sions,” said Bay­ern coach Hansi Flick af­ter the 2-1 win over Sevilla.</p>
    <p>“It was good to have this at­mos­phere, it’s great that fans came, it’s bet­ter for foot­ball ob­vi­ously. It was more like foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing had to pass in front of spe­cial ther­mal cam­eras which mea­sure fans’ body tem­per­a­tures be­fore en­ter­ing the sta­dium, Wid­mann was one of around only a thou­sand Bay­ern fans who made the trip from Ger­many.</p>
    <p>The sea­son ticket holder at Mu­nich’s Al­lianz Arena was re­warded as the Bavar­ian giants com­pleted a quadru­ple.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally spe­cial, be­cause Bay­ern have spoilt us in re­cent months. So there’s a lot of joy,” added Wid­mann, who had to cheer last sea­son’s Bun­desliga, Ger­man Cup and Cham­pi­ons League tri­umphs via tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>The match in Bu­da­pest was also the first time Sevilla fans could see the Span­ish La Liga team play live in a sta­dium since March. A noisy group of 350 Sevilla fans cheered their team.</p>
    <p>At the start of the match, so­cial dis­tanc­ing was ob­served fairly well – un­like in Hun­gar­ian do­mes­tic league games, when it has not been en­forced.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the first goal, a penalty by Sevilla winger Lu­cas Ocam­pos, even hard­core fans in a cor­ner sec­tion stayed well apart – although four Span­ish re­porters in the stands came to­gether for a quick bear hug.</p>
    <p>The equaliser by Bay­ern mid­fielder Leon Goret­zka showed that most peo­ple in the arena were over­whelm­ingly fans of the Bavar­ian club but they re­mained safely spread out as they cel­e­brated loudly. They also showed re­straint when mid­fielder Javi Martinez put Bay­ern ahead in the first pe­riod of ex­tra time and the Ger­man cham­pi­ons hung on.</p>
    <p>All fans re­turn­ing to Ger­many must test neg­a­tive for Covid-19 or face a two-week quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Uefa pres­i­dent Alek­sander Ce­ferin said the or­gan­i­sa­tion would use the ex­pe­ri­ence to de­cide what to do about fu­ture games.</p>
    <p>It was good to have this at­mos­phere, it’s great that fans came, it’s bet­ter for foot­ball ob­vi­ously. It was more like foot­ball.</p>
