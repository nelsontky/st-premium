    <p>The new Khoo Teck Puat-Na­tional Univer­sity Chil­dren’s Med­i­cal In­sti­tute aims to put its child visi­tors at ease from the get-go. The 10-storey am­bu­la­tory cen­tre has adopted a “playscape” de­sign ap­proach (above) to make vis­it­ing the hos­pi­tal less stress­ful for chil­dren, their fam­i­lies and care­givers.</p>
    <p>The Khoo Teck Puat-Na­tional Univer­sity Chil­dren’s Med­i­cal In­sti­tute wants to make kids’ med­i­cal ap­point­ments en­joy­able with its play­ful de­sign</p>
    <p>The new Khoo Teck Puat-Na­tional Univer­sity Chil­dren’s Med­i­cal In­sti­tute aims to put its child visi­tors at ease from the get-go.</p>
    <p>The 10-storey am­bu­la­tory cen­tre in Lower Kent Ridge Road has adopted a “playscape” de­sign ap­proach to make vis­it­ing the hos­pi­tal less stress­ful for chil­dren, their fam­i­lies and care­givers.</p>
    <p>Re­cep­tion ar­eas, for in­stance, have green rain­for­est, rus­tic sa­van­nah and cool arc­tic themes.</p>
    <p>The in­sti­tute re­cently won two global de­sign awards for meld­ing na­ture and sci­ence in its in­te­rior de­sign.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, it bagged the 2020 Health­care De­sign Award in the am­bu­la­tory and pae­di­atric cat­e­gory given out by the In­ter­na­tional In­te­rior De­sign As­so­ci­a­tion in the United States. A month ear­lier, it re­ceived the Best In­ter­na­tional Health Project 2020 Un­der 40,000 Square Me­tres awarded by the In­ter­na­tional Academy for De­sign and Health in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>The new build­ing, which groups the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal’s pae­di­atric out­pa­tient ser­vices un­der one roof, was funded by a $50 mil­lion do­na­tion from the es­tate of the late hote­lier and phi­lan­thropist Khoo Teck Puat in 2010. It took two years to com­plete.</p>
    <p>Since the in­sti­tute opened its doors on Jan 14 last year, it has seen about 150,000 pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Un­der the “playscape” ethos, the en­vi­ron­ment and in­te­ri­ors pro­vide chil­dren and par­ents with a holis­tic ap­proach to care, says Pro­fes­sor Lee Yung Seng, head of the in­sti­tute and group di­rec­tor of Na­tional Univer­sity Health Sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“Stud­ies have shown that through good play, a child’s body, mind and soul are stim­u­lated and this en­cour­ages in­ter­ac­tion and cre­ative devel­op­ment,” says Prof Lee.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Daniel Goh, the in­sti­tute’s se­nior consultant, was in­volved in the devel­op­ment of the build­ing in 2015. He says the mo­ti­va­tion be­hind the plan­ning and de­sign was pri­mar­ily the pa­tients and the fam­i­lies the cen­tre cares for, as well as the staff.</p>
    <p>“We want our pa­tients to feel happy, com­fort­able and less anx­ious dur­ing clinic vis­its, and for staff to work op­ti­mally in an en­vi­ron­ment that is con­ducive to de­liv­er­ing the best care pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>The idea of hav­ing var­i­ous themes across the dif­fer­ent floors of the cen­tre was jointly de­vel­oped by the project team and ar­chi­tects, he says.</p>
    <p>“The con­cept was to cre­ate ‘dif­fer­ent worlds’ in each area, with fa­mil­iar and friendly de­signs that ev­ery child, even adult visi­tors, can im­merse them­selves in,” says Prof Goh.</p>
    <p>“For in­stance, at some lev­els, there are dif­fer­ent an­i­mals hid­den on the sides of the wooden slats on the wall decor, vis­i­ble only at cer­tain an­gles – a bit of a fun ‘hide-and-seek’ fea­ture.”</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute pa­tient G’lin Chua, seven, no longer has in­hi­bi­tions about play­ing when vis­it­ing the doc­tor. “I like the play­grounds and my favourite is the one with the tree­house slide,” she says.</p>
    <p>Her mother, who wants to be known only as Mrs Chua, is grate­ful the doc­tors take time to lis­ten and un­der­stand par­ents’ con­cerns about their chil­dren.</p>
    <p>“The spe­cial­ity nurse will al­ways try to make G’lin com­fort­able and happy dur­ing treat­ments and blood tests,” says Mrs Chua. “It helps that the new cen­tre is much qui­eter com­pared with the old clinic. It is more spa­cious and we feel more at peace while wait­ing. The kids are also en­ter­tained with the play ar­eas and don’t get bored or even scared while wait­ing to see the doc­tor.”</p>
    <p>Prof Goh says that the de­sign of health­care fa­cil­i­ties will play a more im­por­tant role in the light of de­mands for in­creas­ingly com­plex med­i­cal ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Pa­tients with com­plex con­di­tions that re­quire care in­volv­ing dif­fer­ent med­i­cal spe­cial­i­ties can now seek treat­ment un­der one roof.</p>
    <p>“Our out­pa­tient cen­tre was planned with these new­gen­er­a­tion ser­vices in mind and we are glad to see the many mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary com­plex ser­vices take shape to­gether with the nu­mer­ous sup­port ser­vices de­vel­oped for these pa­tients.</p>
    <p>“We ex­pect to de­liver greater con­ve­nience and bet­ter pa­tient out­comes over time.”</p>
