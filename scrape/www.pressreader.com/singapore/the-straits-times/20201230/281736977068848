    <p>WASHINGTON • US Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den has said that his tran­si­tion team faced “ob­struc­tion” from the De­fence De­part­ment, rais­ing new con­cerns about the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s co­op­er­a­tion with tran­si­tion of­fi­cials with just a lit­tle more than three weeks un­til in­au­gu­ra­tion day.</p>
    <p>“Right now, we just aren’t get­ting all the in­for­ma­tion that we need from the out­go­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion in key na­tional se­cu­rity ar­eas,” Mr Bi­den said in Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware, on Mon­day, after he and Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris were briefed by mem­bers of the tran­si­tion’s agency re­view teams for agen­cies deal­ing with na­tional se­cu­rity and for­eign pol­icy, like the De­fence and State depart­ments.</p>
    <p>“It’s noth­ing short, in my view, of ir­re­spon­si­bil­ity,” Mr Bi­den said.</p>
    <p>In his re­marks, the Pres­i­den­t­elect said his team had “en­coun­tered road­blocks” from po­lit­i­cal lead­ers at the De­fence De­part­ment as well as at the Of­fice of Man­age­ment and Budget.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den em­pha­sised the im­por­tance of a smooth tran­si­tion.</p>
    <p>“Right now, as our na­tion is in a pe­riod of tran­si­tion, we need to make sure that noth­ing is lost in the hand-off be­tween ad­min­is­tra­tions,” he said</p>
    <p>“My team needs a clear pic­ture of our force pos­ture around the world and our op­er­a­tions to de­ter our ene­mies. We need full vis­i­bil­ity into the budget plan­ning un­der­way at the De­fence De­part­ment and other agen­cies in or­der to avoid any win­dow of con­fu­sion or catchup that our ad­ver­saries may try to ex­ploit,” he added.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Mon­day, Act­ing De­fence Sec­re­tary Christo­pher Miller de­fended the de­part­ment’s level of co­op­er­a­tion with the Bi­den team.</p>
    <p>He said the de­part­ment was con­tin­u­ing “to sched­ule ad­di­tional meet­ings for the re­main­der of the tran­si­tion and an­swer any and all re­quests for in­for­ma­tion in our purview”.</p>
    <p>“Our (de­part­ment’s) po­lit­i­cal and ca­reer of­fi­cials have been work­ing with the ut­most pro­fes­sion­al­ism to sup­port tran­si­tion ac­tiv­i­ties in a com­pressed time sched­ule, and they will con­tinue to do so in a trans­par­ent and col­le­gial man­ner that up­holds the finest tra­di­tions of the de­part­ment,” Mr Miller said.</p>
    <p>“The Amer­i­can peo­ple ex­pect noth­ing less, and that is what I re­main com­mit­ted to.”</p>
    <p>The Bi­den tran­si­tion was ham­strung at the out­set by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s de­lay in for­mally des­ig­nat­ing Mr Bi­den as the ap­par­ent win­ner of the elec­tion.</p>
