    <p>D.E. Shaw & Co will open an of­fice in Sin­ga­pore next year, join­ing other hedge funds ex­pand­ing in the city state to ex­tend their reach in Asia.</p>
    <p>The firm, one of the world’s big­gest hedge funds with more than US$50 bil­lion (S$68 bil­lion) in in­vest­ment cap­i­tal, has ap­plied for a fund man­age­ment li­cence from the Sin­ga­pore cen­tral bank, adding to ex­ist­ing Asian op­er­a­tions in Hong Kong and Shang­hai, ac­cord­ing to a state­ment on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>It is the lat­est fund man­age­ment gi­ant to open Asian of­fices be­yond Hong Kong amid ris­ing so­cial and po­lit­i­cal un­cer­tainty in the city. Bil­lion­aire Ken Griffin’s Ci­tadel an­nounced in Au­gust it would open an of­fice in Sin­ga­pore. Lon­don-based Mar­shall Wace is do­ing the same, the Fi­nan­cial Times re­ported last month.</p>
    <p>All three firms have of­fices in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore has not been ac­tively court­ing money man­agers wor­ried about tur­moil in Hong Kong, it has reaped some ben­e­fits. The num­ber of sin­gle-fam­ily of­fices in Sin­ga­pore has grown in re­cent years to about 200, while over­all as­sets un­der man­age­ment rose by 16 per cent last year to $4 tril­lion.</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can in­vestor Izzy Eng­lan­der’s Mil­len­nium Man­age­ment re­cently in­vested in Sin­ga­pore-based RV Cap­i­tal Man­age­ment, bring­ing its as­sets un­der man­age­ment to US$1 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>“Open­ing an of­fice in Sin­ga­pore will fur­ther en­able us to tap into the re­gion’s tal­ent, cap­i­tal, and in­vest­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties,” D.E. Shaw group Asia-Pa­cific gen­eral man­ager Kevin Pa­tric said in the state­ment. “This is a log­i­cal next step in the growth of our ge­o­graphic foot­print.”</p>
    <p>China is a key mar­ket for the New York-based D.E. Shaw, which was granted a fund li­cence there last year to raise pri­vate cap­i­tal to in­vest in the do­mes­tic mar­ket. Fund rais­ing for its first on­shore prod­uct largely con­cluded in May.</p>
    <p>The firm has also been at­tract­ing money from other parts of the world de­spite the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In July, it was plan­ning to raise about US$1 bil­lion for its lat­est pri­vate eq­uity-style fund, ac­cord­ing to fil­ings and peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter. And in March, when it opened its doors to fresh cap­i­tal for the first time in seven years, it raised US$2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1988 by com­puter sci­en­tist David Shaw, the group runs one of the world’s long­est-run­ning hedge funds and was among the ear­li­est to use com­plex math­e­mat­i­cal mod­els for trad­ing.</p>
    <p>The com­pany opened its Hong Kong of­fice in 2007 and has been in Shang­hai since 2010.</p>
