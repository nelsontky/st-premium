    <p>Bri­tain’s min­is­ters are con­sid­er­ing strength­en­ing ex­ist­ing se­cu­rity laws after a re­port by MPs in Lon­don ac­cused the gov­ern­ment of un­der­es­ti­mat­ing al­leged Rus­sian in­ter­fer­ence in the coun­try’s do­mes­tic pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Home Of­fice Min­is­ter James Bro­ken­shire has told Par­lia­ment that his gov­ern­ment is “com­mit­ted to new es­pi­onage leg­is­la­tion” and ad­di­tional laws against “hos­tile state ac­tiv­ity”. He says this will in­clude con­sid­er­ing whether to force for­eign agents to reg­is­ter, and the cre­ation of new of­fences and pow­ers for deal­ing with for­eign spies.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the gov­ern­ment re­sponse was dis­missed by Labour, Bri­tain’s main op­po­si­tion party, as in­ad­e­quate in ad­dress­ing the “mul­ti­ple short­com­ings” iden­ti­fied in the lat­est par­lia­men­tary se­cu­rity re­port into Rus­sian ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish Par­lia­ment’s In­tel­li­gence and Se­cu­rity Com­mit­tee an­a­lysed Rus­sia’s op­er­a­tions in the United King­dom for most of last year. Par­lia­men­tar­i­ans looked at al­le­ga­tions of Rus­sian in­ter­fer­ence in two ref­er­en­dums: the one on Scot­land’s in­de­pen­dence, which took place in 2014, and the one on Bri­tain’s con­tin­ued mem­ber­ship in the Euro­pean Union, held in 2016. In ad­di­tion, MPs also looked at al­le­ga­tions of Rus­sian in­volve­ment in the 2015 Bri­tish gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>As such, the Bri­tish par­lia­men­tary re­port is prob­a­bly the most com­pre­hen­sive of­fi­cial anal­y­sis of Rus­sia’s al­leged es­pi­onage and desta­bil­i­sa­tion ac­tiv­i­ties com­piled in the West.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar ef­forts un­der­taken by the United States Congress or the Amer­i­can in­tel­li­gence agen­cies have ei­ther re­mained se­cret, or been con­fined to al­leged Rus­sian in­ter­fer­ence in the 2016 Amer­i­can pres­i­den­tial elec­toral cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish re­port was ready for re­lease last Novem­ber, but its pub­li­ca­tion was de­layed by Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son for rea­sons that were never fully ex­plained.</p>
    <p>The ver­sion that was fi­nally re­leased this week is still heav­ily edited, with the *** sym­bol ap­pear­ing on most pages, in­di­cat­ing in Bri­tish of­fi­cial lan­guage a sec­tion that was re­moved for na­tional se­cu­rity rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Still, the re­port paints a pic­ture of sus­tained in­volve­ment by Rus­sian agents of in­flu­ence and by real or imag­ined ac­tors on so­cial plat­forms in all the three bal­lots un­der investigat­ion.</p>
    <p>The com­mit­tee claims that the UK gov­ern­ment “badly un­der­es­ti­mated” the Rus­sian threat and the re­sponse it re­quired.</p>
    <p>The re­port also claims Rus­sian desta­bil­i­sa­tion ac­tions in the UK should from now on be treated as “the new nor­mal”, and that the UK was a top West­ern in­tel­li­gence tar­get for the Rus­sian gov­ern­ment, be­hind only Nato – the US-led mil­i­tary al­liance in Europe – and, of course, the US it­self.</p>
    <p>There is no ques­tion that the ac­cu­sa­tions are se­verely dam­ag­ing for the gov­ern­ment in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>For not only are MPs al­leg­ing that Bri­tain’s in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity “took its eye off the ball, be­cause of its fo­cus on counter-ter­ror­ism”; but the log­i­cal con­clu­sion of the re­port is that, had the Bri­tish been more alert, they could also have alerted their Amer­i­can col­leagues of what was afoot well be­fore the Novem­ber 2016 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion when the en­tire ques­tion of</p>
    <p>Rus­sian in­ter­fer­ence rose to in­ter­na­tional promi­nence.</p>
    <p>In an im­me­di­ate re­sponse to the re­port, For­eign Sec­re­tary Do­minic Raab “cat­e­gor­i­cally re­jected” the claim made by one MP mem­ber of the com­mit­tee that the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment had “ac­tively avoided look­ing for ev­i­dence of Rus­sian in­ter­fer­ence”.</p>
    <p>And a spokesman for Mr John­son sub­se­quently claimed that the Bri­tish gov­ern­ment was “fully aware of the sig­nif­i­cant and en­dur­ing threat” Rus­sia posed.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in Lon­don will prob­a­bly be able to es­cape a se­ri­ous dis­cus­sion about ad­dress­ing the fail­ures of their in­tel­li­gence ser­vices by in­vok­ing the tra­di­tional need for se­crecy.</p>
    <p>Yet what Bri­tish min­is­ters may find much more dif­fi­cult to de­flect are the re­port’s ac­cu­sa­tions that “the UK wel­comed Rus­sian money, and few ques­tions – if any – were asked about the prove­nance of this con­sid­er­able wealth”.</p>
    <p>“A large pri­vate se­cu­rity in­dus­try has de­vel­oped in the UK to ser­vice the needs of the Rus­sian elite,” MPs claimed; “lawyers, ac­coun­tants, es­tate agents and PR pro­fes­sion­als have played a role, wit­tingly or un­wit­tingly, in the ex­ten­sion of Rus­sian in­flu­ence which is of­ten linked to pro­mot­ing the ne­far­i­ous in­ter­ests of the Rus­sian state,” they added.</p>
    <p>The re­port not only con­firms what fi­nance spe­cial­ists have known for years about Lon­don’s role as a main cen­tre for the laun­der­ing of Rus­sian oli­garchs’ cash; but, amid all the redac­tions, it is also full of tan­ta­lis­ing hints about do­na­tions to po­lit­i­cal par­ties, and of politi­cians be­ing re­tained by ma­jor Rus­sian busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Rus­sian For­eign Min­istry has dis­missed all ac­cu­sa­tions as the prod­ucts of “Rus­so­pho­bia”. Although in pri­vate, the Rus­sians are prob­a­bly not too un­happy with be­ing de­picted as Bri­tain’s top ad­ver­saries.</p>
