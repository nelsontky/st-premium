    <p>Ear­lier this year, four art teach­ers banded to­gether to bring the joy of art to un­der­priv­i­leged chil­dren and to those with spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>That is how project Hearts of Hope was born at CHIJ Our Lady of the Na­tiv­ity (OLN).</p>
    <p>Led by Ms Nur Ilyana Mo­hamed An­war, 38, who has been an art teacher for 15 years, the team put to­gether more than 260 art ma­te­rial kits and dis­trib­uted them as part of Chil­dren’s Day cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>The idea came to Ms Ilyana dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, af­ter she saw a Face­book post about a grant of­fered for ground-up ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>She then asked her fel­low art teach­ers at CHIJ OLN if they were keen to do some­thing for the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Ms Ilyana said: “I drew up the pro­posal, sub­mit­ted it, and that got the ball rolling.”</p>
    <p>The teacher wanted to cre­ate the kits to en­gage the chil­dren in mean­ing­ful creative ac­tiv­i­ties and give them an op­por­tu­nity to de­velop their self-es­teem.</p>
    <p>The kits con­tain items such as wa­ter­colours and con­struc­tion pa­per, and are each worth $40 to $50.</p>
    <p>They were given out to 105 pupils on the fi­nan­cial as­sis­tance scheme and to 110 stu­dents from Minds’ Fern­vale Gar­dens School.</p>
    <p>Fifty kits were given to the In­fant Je­sus Homes and Chil­dren’s Cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Pupils from CHIJ OLN were also in­volved in the project. Some did step-by-step draw­ings that were compiled into a dig­i­tal work­sheet for the ben­e­fi­cia­ries to fol­low and learn to draw dif­fer­ent things, while oth­ers helped pack the kits.</p>
    <p>The project will cul­mi­nate in a vir­tual art ex­hi­bi­tion that will be launched on Dec 31, for which ben­e­fi­cia­ries and CHIJ OLN pupils have con­trib­uted 54 art pieces al­to­gether.</p>
    <p>The pieces will also be up­loaded on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“The idea be­hind the ex­hi­bi­tion is to give them the op­por­tu­nity to show­case their art­work and drive the idea that to cre­ate some­thing is not beyond any­one but some­thing ev­ery­one can do,” said Ms Ilyana.</p>
    <p>“This will give them a sense of pride and con­fi­dence, so they know their art­work is ap­pre­ci­ated and val­ued by oth­ers,” she added.</p>
    <p>The project re­ceived fund­ing from the os­car@sg fund, which helped cover the ex­penses from the art kits, said Ms Ilyana.</p>
    <p>The os­car@sg fund, an­chored by a $10 mil­lion do­na­tion from Te­masek, sup­ports ground-up ini­tia­tives ad­dress­ing sig­nif­i­cant or ur­gent com­mu­nity needs in Sin­ga­pore amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ms Ilyana hopes to make the art ex­hi­bi­tion a yearly af­fair.</p>
    <p>“An­other dream is to turn this vir­tual ex­hi­bi­tion into a phys­i­cal ex­hi­bi­tion. If we can put the art­work up for sale, we could do­nate the pro­ceeds to other ben­e­fi­cia­ries.”</p>
