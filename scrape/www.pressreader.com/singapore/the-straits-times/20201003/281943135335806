    <p>Although the Al­ways Home Cam is mar­keted as a home de­vice, Univer­sity of Wash­ing­ton law pro­fes­sor and pri­vacy re­searcher Ryan Calo said it could be used in a work­place as well and “al­lows the per­son who con­trols it to check on any­one – and there isn’t any­where to hide” .</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON • It could be the wack­i­est prod­uct yet from Ama­zon – a tiny in­door drone which buzzes around peo­ple’s homes as a se­cu­rity sen­try.</p>
    <p>The in­tro­duc­tion of the Ring Al­ways Home Cam planned for next year has opened up fresh de­bate on the po­ten­tial for in­tru­sive sur­veil­lance and pri­vacy in­fringe­ment.</p>
    <p>Ama­zon says the tiny drone is “built with pri­vacy in mind” and op­er­ates at the di­rec­tion of its cus­tomers. Nes­tled in a charg­ing dock, the drone can be de­ployed re­motely and send up to five minutes of video to the user.</p>
    <p>But some ac­tivists ex­press con­cerns about the de­vice – part of a fam­ily of Ring-branded home se­cu­rity tech­nol­ogy which has been scru­ti­nised over its links to law en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr John Verdi, vice-pres­i­dent of pol­icy at the Fu­ture of Pri­vacy Fo­rum, a Wash­ing­ton think-tank, said the de­ploy­ment may con­trib­ute to a “nor­mal­i­sa­tion of sur­veil­lance” in ev­ery­day life as more con­sumers in­stall de­vices that lis­ten and see in­side the home.</p>
    <p>“When cam­eras and mi­cro­phones and other sen­sors are de­ployed in pri­vate spa­ces like liv­ing rooms and bed­rooms, that leads to an ac­cep­tance of ev­ery­day sur­veil­lance,” Mr Verdi said.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, Mr Verdi noted that “Ama­zon has put some thought into pri­vacy pro­tec­tions for this prod­uct both in the hard­ware and in the soft­ware poli­cies”.</p>
    <p>Univer­sity of Wash­ing­ton law pro­fes­sor and pri­vacy re­searcher Ryan Calo noted that even the per­cep­tion of be­ing watched can make peo­ple change be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>With any form of elec­tronic mon­i­tor­ing, “you feel like there is a so­cial agent in your midst”, Prof Calo said.</p>
    <p>“A cam­era like this can make peo­ple feel ob­served and it threat­ens one of the few re­main­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for soli­tude.”</p>
    <p>Prof Calo said the fly­ing cam “could be in­cre­men­tally more harm­ful than a reg­u­lar cam­era” by al­low­ing some­one to mon­i­tor other peo­ple with­out their con­sent.</p>
    <p>Although it is mar­keted as a home de­vice, Prof Calo said it could be used in a work­place as well and “al­lows the per­son who con­trols it to check on any­one – and there isn’t any­where to hide”. This could en­able an abu­sive spouse to mon­i­tor a part­ner, for ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>Bri­tish-based pri­vacy group Big Brother Watch was more blunt, call­ing the cam “ar­guably Ama­zon’s most chill­ing sur­veil­lance prod­uct yet”.</p>
    <p>An Ama­zon spokesman said of the new de­vice: “Our cus­tomers are look­ing for ways to keep their homes and fam­i­lies safe, con­nected, and se­cure – and our new prod­ucts and fea­tures, in­clud­ing the Al­ways Home Cam, help do just that.”</p>
    <p>Ama­zon, which pur­chased Ring in 2018, has faced a wave of crit­i­cism over its shar­ing of sur­veil­lance footage from its door­bell cam­era and part­ner­ships with po­lice de­part­ments which have en­cour­aged home­own­ers to use the de­vices.</p>
    <p>But Ama­zon said Ring in­door cam­eras are not sub­ject to law en­force­ment re­quests and have no mi­cro­phone to record au­dio.</p>
    <p>Prof Calo said that de­spite Ama­zon’s pledge not to share video with law en­force­ment, “it may not be up to Ama­zon – it might be up to a court if po­lice re­quest a war­rant”.</p>
    <p>Separately, some fear these mon­i­tor­ing de­vices could be sur­rep­ti­tiously used to gather data for mar­ket­ing by Ama­zon or its part­ners.</p>
    <p>While it was not clear how data from the drones might be used, Prof Calo said “Ama­zon has a long track record of at­tempt­ing to mon­e­tise what it knows about you from search his­tory or pur­chase his­tory. It’s part of its business model”.</p>
