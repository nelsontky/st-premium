    <p>NEW YORK • The dom­i­nance of tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies has eclipsed ev­ery other story in this year’s pan­demic-up­ended stock mar­ket. Now it is forc­ing a re­order­ing of the world’s most fa­mous stock bench­mark.</p>
    <p>In the big­gest reshuf­fling in seven years, Exxon Mo­bil, Pfizer and Raytheon Tech­nolo­gies were kicked out of the Dow Jones In­dus­trial Av­er­age, moves that will boost the in­flu­ence of tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies that have dom­i­nated the stock mar­ket this year.</p>
    <p>Sales­force.com, Am­gen and Honey­well In­ter­na­tional will enter the 124-year-old equity gauge next week, its over­seers said.</p>
    <p>The ac­tions were prompted when Apple – which is cur­rently 12 per cent of the 30-stock in­dex – an­nounced a stock split that ef­fec­tively re­duced the sway of com­puter and soft­ware stocks in the price-weighted av­er­age. Apple is worth more than US$2 tril­lion (S$2.7 tril­lion).</p>
    <p>The moves rep­re­sent an equally sig­nif­i­cant em­brace of tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies, whose gi­ant ral­lies have fre­quently caused the Dow to trail other ma­jor in­dexes this year.</p>
    <p>“Those changes are a sign of the times – out with en­ergy and in with cloud,” said Mr Chris Zac­carelli, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer for In­de­pen­dent Ad­vi­sor Al­liance.</p>
    <p>The lat­est reshuf­fling comes as tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies have come to dom­i­nate the stock mar­ket in a trend am­pli­fied by this year’s Covid-19 lock­downs.</p>
    <p>While the Dow av­er­age is still 4.2 per cent off its Fe­bru­ary record, the tech-heavy Nas­daq 100 is al­most 20 per cent above the pre-pan­demic all-time high.</p>
    <p>While any change to the Dow is notable, the ejec­tion of Exxon Mo­bil – the world’s big­gest com­pany as re­cently as 2011 – marks a par­tic­u­larly stun­ning fall from grace, re­flect­ing the de­cline of com­mod­ity com­pa­nies in the Amer­i­can econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Worth US$525 bil­lion in 2007 and more than US$450 bil­lion as re­cently as 2014, the stock had fallen in four of six years be­fore this year and is down an­other 40 per cent since Jan­uary. It is now worth about</p>
    <p>US$180 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Founded in 1999, Sales­force was one of the best-per­form­ing stocks of the bull mar­ket fol­low­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, ris­ing 27-fold since March 2009.</p>
    <p>Am­gen is among the world’s big­gest biotech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies with a mar­ket value of about US$137 bil­lion, though it is re­plac­ing a com­pany – Pfizer – that is about US$90 bil­lion larger.</p>
    <p>Stocks of the af­fected com­pa­nies were quick to price in the shakeup. Shares of Exxon dropped 2 per cent as of 6.10pm in New York, in af­ter-hours trad­ing, while Raytheon fell 3 per cent. Honey­well climbed 3.5 per cent and Sales­force.com rose 4 per cent. Pfizer dropped 1.9 per cent and Am­gen rose 4 per cent.</p>
    <p>This is the sec­ond time a stock split by Apple has had pro­found con­se­quences for the Dow av­er­age. The first was in 2014, when its seven-for-one split low­ered the price of its shares enough to make in­clu­sion fea­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Apple’s de­ci­sion to do it again this year ef­fec­tively low­ered its sway on the price-weighted av­er­age, mak­ing the in­flu­ence of tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies too small in the eyes of the Dow’s han­dlers.</p>
    <p>Un­der-rep­re­sen­ta­tion of tech­nol</p>
    <p>Stocks of the af­fected com­pa­nies were quick to price in the shake-up. Shares of Exxon dropped 2 per cent as of 6.10pm in New York, in af­ter-hours trad­ing, while Raytheon fell 3 per cent. Honey­well climbed 3.5 per cent and Sales­force.com rose 4 per cent. Pfizer dropped 1.9 per cent and Am­gen rose 4 per cent.</p>
    <p>ogy com­pa­nies has oc­ca­sion­ally pe­nalised the Dow this year, when it has fre­quently trailed the mar­ket­cap weighted S&P 500, whose con­cen­tra­tion on mega­cap com­pa­nies like Ama­zon.com and Al­pha­bet has juiced its re­turns.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther of those com­pa­nies is ef­fec­tively el­i­gi­ble for the Dow, given their US$1,000-plus share prices.</p>
    <p>The blue-chip in­dex weights its con­stituents by price rather than mar­ket value, mak­ing it dif­fer­ent from the broader S&P 500.</p>
    <p>Honey­well, mean­while, is re­turn­ing to the av­er­age af­ter be­ing kicked out 12 years ago to make way for a fi­nan­cial ser­vices com­pany, Bank of Amer­ica, and an en­ergy pro­ducer, Chevron.</p>
    <p>While the Dow’s in­flu­ence has faded over the years as pas­sive man­agers linked to bench­marks based on mar­ket value, the in­dex re­mains an ex­clu­sive club and still serves as one of the high­est pro­file show­case of Amer­i­can in­dus­trial heft.</p>
    <p>Roughly US$31.5 bil­lion of as­sets are bench­marked to the Dow, with US$28.2 bil­lion of pas­sively man­aged funds linked.</p>
    <p>The last time three com­pa­nies were added to the Dow was seven years ago, when Visa, Gold­man Sachs Group and Nike dis­placed Bank of Amer­ica, Hewlett-Packard and Al­coa.</p>
