    <p>With the out­break of the mos­quito-borne dengue fever in Sin­ga­pore this year, it seems pru­dent to stock up on mos­quito re­pel­lent and traps.</p>
    <p>And as the haze is an­other peren­nial is­sue here, would it not be perfect if there was a de­vice that could catch mos­qui­toes and clean the air at the same time?</p>
    <p>Sharp’s air pu­ri­fier (FP-JM40E-B) claims to do both. As a bonus, it is also said to in­hibit bac­te­ria and viruses in the air through the re­lease of charged ions.</p>
    <p>Its mos­quito catcher func­tion re­lies on a com­bi­na­tion of ul­tra­vi­o­let light and a black fin­ish to lure mos­qui­toes to the open­ings at the back of the air pu­ri­fier, where they will be sucked in and caught by a glue sheet.</p>
    <p>Sharp says a lab­o­ra­tory test con­ducted with the In­sti­tute for Med­i­cal Re­search in Malaysia found that its air pu­ri­fier could re­duce up to 91 per cent of Culex mos­qui­toes and, more im­por­tantly, up to 73 per cent of the Aedes vari­ant that spreads dengue.</p>
    <p>To find out its real-world ef­fi­cacy, I left the Sharp air pu­ri­fier turned on 24/7 in my home. Three weeks later, there was just one dead mos­quito on the glue sheet.</p>
    <p>Of course, I had some inkling that the mos­quito catcher is not quite up to scratch. Dur­ing the test pe­riod, I was bit­ten sev­eral times by mos­qui­toes while seated near the air pu­ri­fier. And in one of my prouder mo­ments, I ac­tu­ally killed two mos­qui­toes with a sin­gle squirt of in­sec­ti­cide within a me­tre of the air pu­ri­fier.</p>
    <p>The in­sec­ti­cide in­ci­dent showed that the Sharp air pu­ri­fier is com­pe­tent at its pri­mary task of clean­ing the air. Within 30 sec­onds of the in­sec­ti­cide be­ing re­leased near it, the de­vice’s LED in­di­ca­tor (dubbed the Clean­li­ness mon­i­tor) changed from blue to red to sig­nal the pres­ence of im­pu­ri­ties in the air. The air pu­ri­fier then au­to­mat­i­cally in­creased the fan speed to re­move the un­pleas­ant odour of the in­sec­ti­cide. Air qual­ity was back to a healthy level in un­der 10 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Sharp says that the air pu­ri­fier can fight cer­tain types of flu viruses by re­leas­ing charged hy­dro­gen and oxy­gen ions. The ions would bond to the sur­face of air­borne viruses and in­hibit their in­fec­tious­ness, ac­cord­ing to stud­ies con­ducted by Sharp with a num­ber of re­search in­sti­tutes.</p>
    <p>In­side the air pu­ri­fier are three dif­fer­ent types of fil­ters – a pre-fil­ter that re­moves larger par­ti­cles, a car­bon fil­ter that re­moves un­pleas­ant odours and a Hepa fil­ter that re­moves up to 99.7 per cent of par­tic­u­late mat­ter, in­clud­ing fine par­ti­cles of less than 2.5 mi­crome­tres (PM2.5).</p>
    <p>Users are prompted via light in­di­ca­tors on the air pu­ri­fier’s con­trol panel to change the fil­ters or re­place the glue sheet. The process is sim­ple and takes a few min­utes. Depend­ing on the en­vi­ron­ment and us­age, the fil­ters ($79 each) are said to last about two years while the glue sheet ($19) about two months.</p>
    <p>At the Auto fan set­ting, this model is quiet – you prob­a­bly will not no­tice its pres­ence. At its max­i­mum fan speed, the noise is that of an elec­tric fan at mod­er­ate speed.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with other air pu­ri­fiers, this model lacks mod­ern func­tions such as sup­port for a smart­phone app.</p>
    <p>While I have no com­plaints about its abil­ity to pu­rify the air, its mos­quito-catch­ing fea­ture does not quite live up to ex­pec­ta­tions.</p>
