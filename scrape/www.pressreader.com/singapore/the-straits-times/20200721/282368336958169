    <p>Chat­ting on­line with friends and fam­ily dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker made me ex­pe­ri­ence how iso­lated some do­mes­tic helpers must feel through­out their work­ing lives.</p>
    <p>My sit­u­a­tion is nowhere as dif­fi­cult as theirs – I live with my im­me­di­ate fam­ily and my stay-home ex­pe­ri­ence was only seven weeks long – but there were some par­al­lels.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, do­mes­tic work­ers get to visit their fam­i­lies only once a year, or every two years. With travel re­stric­tions in place, many of us with fam­ily over­seas are plunged into a sim­i­lar sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Last week, I came across a piece of art which cap­tured th­ese thoughts in a vis­ual medium.</p>
    <p>The art­work de­picted a do­mes­tic worker, on a mat­tress on the ground, back lean­ing against a cold con­crete wall. On the mat­tress is a mo­bile phone propped up by a pil­low – in­di­cat­ing that this must be a rel­a­tively long chat.</p>
    <p>On the screen of the phone is a tiny face – the dif­fer­ence in size between the two in con­ver­sa­tion fur­ther em­pha­sis­ing the iso­la­tion as the do­mes­tic worker has to make do with this min­i­mal amount of facetime.</p>
    <p>The words in the work read: “A do­mes­tic worker lives a lock­down life on a daily ba­sis.”</p>
    <p>See­ing my thoughts mir­rored in the work by Sin­ga­pore artist Weng Pixin, 37, made it all the more vis­ceral.</p>
    <p>A cri­sis can make one more aware of the less priv­i­leged among us, and art that re­sponds to a cri­sis can, in tan­dem, re­in­force our em­pa­thy.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, works speak to peo­ple for dif­fer­ent rea­sons: a pow­er­ful brush­stroke can in­spire awe, while a burst of colour can prompt a well­spring of emo­tions.</p>
    <p>But for a work to res­onate with a larger au­di­ence and truly mat­ter, it must cap­ture a mo­ment, whether through tech­nique, sub­ject mat­ter, or form; it must re­flect the com­mon ex­pe­ri­ence and col­lec­tive sighs and laugh­ter of the times we live through. Oth­er­wise, it is just a dec­o­ra­tive piece, of which we have no lack.</p>
    <p>Vis­ual art is spe­cial in that a piece that cap­tures a sliver of time does not lose its rel­e­vance as quickly as other art­forms might. In­stead, it might be all the more prized for its in­ter­pre­ta­tion or doc­u­men­ta­tion of his­tory in years to come.</p>
    <p>Take Chua Mia Tee’s Na­tional Lan­guage Class, for ex­am­ple. Painted in 1959, it shows nine stu­dents gath­ered in a small class­room learn­ing Malay. This was in the years lead­ing up to the merger of Sin­ga­pore, the Fed­er­a­tion of Malaya, North Bor­neo (Sabah) and Sarawak in 1963 and the work is val­ued for cap­tur­ing the po­lit­i­cal aware­ness and anti-colo­nial sen­ti­ment of the time.</p>
    <p>It takes pride of place in Na­tional Gallery Sin­ga­pore and is re­garded as a must-see piece.</p>
    <p>To­day, works that re­flect our sit­u­a­tion and are shared in a timely fash­ion on so­cial me­dia have added cur­rency and rel­e­vance.</p>
    <p>I have had my reser­va­tions about the re­la­tion­ship between art and In­sta­gram, but un­der cur­rent cir­cum­stances, the plat­form has re­ally demon­strated its abil­ity to help us con­nect and trans­mit works from the artist’s stu­dio to the viewer.</p>
    <p>Weng’s piece on the do­mes­tic worker was an ex­am­ple of this.</p>
    <p>In see­ing the work, I re­alised that the grow­ing strug­gle I have about do­mes­tic work­ers and their iso­la­tion was also shared by oth­ers, mak­ing me, iron­i­cally, feel less alone.</p>
    <p>So I thank the artists out there who are still cre­at­ing in th­ese strange times and hope more will feel in­clined to do so.</p>
    <p>As Chi­nese artist Ai Wei Wei put it quite saliently in an In­sta­gram post: “It is not enough to re­flect on the new con­di­tions and while away the time with­out fully in­hab­it­ing this mo­ment. Ac­tu­al­is­ing one’s in­ner need to par­tic­i­pate gives life dur­ing Covid a new mean­ing.”</p>
    <p>Here are some artists heed­ing that call.</p>
