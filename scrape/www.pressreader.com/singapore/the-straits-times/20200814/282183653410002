    <p>LONDON • After a frus­trat­ing sum­mer of can­cel­la­tions, ex­hi­bi­tions and vir­tual com­pe­ti­tions, ath­let­ics will fi­nally able to un­veil its shop win­dow as the Di­a­mond League swings into be­lated ac­tion with a star-stud­ded field in Monaco to­day.</p>
    <p>Track and field should have been tak­ing cen­tre stage at the Tokyo Olympics this week, but that highlight has long been wiped from this year’s cal­en­dar due to Covid-19, along with a host of Di­a­mond League events.</p>
    <p>So it is no ex­ag­ger­a­tion to de­scribe to­day’s sea­son-open­ing</p>
    <p>Meet­ing Her­culis as ea­gerly awaited, and top­ping a high-class bill in the prin­ci­pal­ity will be Noah Lyles in the 200 me­tres.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old world cham­pion faces some qual­ity com­pe­ti­tion in the shape of Ramil Guliyev and Christophe Le­maitre, as well as his younger brother, Jose­phus, 22.</p>
    <p>Lyles has ad­mit­ted hav­ing psy­cho­log­i­cal prob­lems wors­ened by the Covid-19 out­break, the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment and the post­pone­ment of the Tokyo Olympics at which he was hotly tipped for suc­cess. Now on anti-de­pres­sants, he is rar­ing to go, say­ing: “I know it’s go­ing to be a re­ally good track... I want to do every­thing in my power to make sure that this race is re­ally fast.”</p>
    <p>Beatrice Chep­koech, who broke the women’s 3,000m steeple­chase world record in 2018 with a time of 8min 44.32sec, and Si­fan Has­san, who did the same over a mile last year (4:12.33), face off over 5,000m in a race also fea­tur­ing world cham­pion Hellen Obiri.</p>
    <p>Pole vaulter Ar­mand Du­plan­tis is an­other world record holder on duty and, after en­joy­ing a suc­cess­ful sum­mer of some­what left-field ex­hi­bi­tions, faces more tra­di­tional com­pe­ti­tion from reign­ing world and Di­a­mond League cham­pion Sam Ken­dricks.</p>
    <p>There will also be two high-qual­ity 1,500m races on the pro­gramme. In the women’s event, 800m world cham­pion Halimah</p>
    <p>Nakaayi will be up against Olympic cham­pion Faith Kipye­gon and Briton Laura Muir.</p>
    <p>In the men’s race, world cham­pion Ti­mothy Cheruiyot gets reac­quainted with the Inge­brigt­sen broth­ers, Filip and Jakob.</p>
    <p>World cham­pion Karsten Warholm is on duty in the men’s 400m hur­dles, while Marie-Josee Ta Lou will start as the favourite in the women’s 100m.</p>
    <p>Ahead of the event, the sport’s gov­ern­ing body World Ath­let­ics, has is­sued a re­minder about the re­cently in­tro­duced “Rule 5”, which puts a sole height limit of 25mm on all shoes worn in track events of 800m and above in dis­tance.</p>
    <p>The rule was in­tro­duced after con­cerns that shoes such as Nike’s Al­phafly were giv­ing ath­letes an un­fair tech­ni­cal ad­van­tage.</p>
    <p>All ath­letes will be Covid-19 tested as part of the strict guide­lines that have al­lowed the event to be held with com­peti­tors trav­el­ling in from around the world.</p>
    <p>“We’ve changed every­thing, from the ath­letes’ travel and ac­com­mo­da­tion lo­gis­tics to the way the com­pe­ti­tion will be staged and con­ducted,” said the Monaco meet’s direc­tor Jean-Pierre Schoebel.</p>
    <p>There has al­ready been one high­pro­file ca­su­alty, with Cons­es­lus Kipruto, the Olympic and world 3,000m steeple­chase cham­pion, drop­ping out ear­lier this week after test­ing pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
