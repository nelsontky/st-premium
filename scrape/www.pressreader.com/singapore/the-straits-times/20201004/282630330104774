    <p>The stream of tourists had dried up, so it was time to woo back lo­cals.</p>
    <p>When restau­rants re­sumed busi­ness i n J une after the cir­cuit breaker, Ma­jes­tic Bay restau­rant at Gar­dens by the Bay de­cided it needed to do some­thing im­pact­ful to at­tract din­ers’ at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>The up­scale Chi­nese seafood restau­rant launched a one-for-one dim sum buf­fet daily deal for lunch and din­ner that cut prices to $21 a per­son. From this month, the deal is avail­able only from Mon­days to Fri­days.</p>
    <p>With more than 10 dim sum items like xiao long bao and steamed honey pork buns, as well as dishes like roast duck, sea prawns with gar­lic and sauteed beef hor fun mak­ing up a to­tal se­lec­tion of about 30 items, it was an in­stant hit.</p>
    <p>Its two lunch seat­ings and sin­gle din­ner seat­ing were al­most fully booked up by fam­i­lies and those hun­gry for a good deal over the past three months.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of din­ers jumped by 60 per cent, said the spokesman, but be­cause of the mas­sive dis­count, it trans­lated to a mod­est rev­enue in­crease.</p>
    <p>“We are lo­cated within a pre­dom­i­nantly tourist area, so we had to pivot to at­tract­ing lo­cals to this lo­ca­tion,” its spokesman said.</p>
    <p>This is not the only fan­tas­tic dim sum of­fer in town.</p>
    <p>An­other seafood restau­rant Red House, which has out­lets in Prin­sep Street and the Grand Copthorne Wa­ter­front Ho­tel, also launched a dim sum and seafood a la carte buf­fet in late June.</p>
    <p>Priced at $28.80 on weekdays and $33.80 on week­ends, the menu con­sists of 52 items, i nclud­ing dishes like pump­kin cray­fish, salted egg cala­mari and deluxe seafood fried rice.</p>
    <p>Dim sum items in­clude har gau, siew mai, cus­tard buns and truf­fle wild mush­room dumplings.</p>
    <p>The price, said the restau­rant’s spokesman Elaine Heng, is about 40 per cent of what it would cost for a sim­i­lar a la carte meal.</p>
    <p>“With the clo­sure of bor­ders and in the cur­rent cli­mate with peo­ple be­ing gen­er­ally more pru­dent with their spend­ing, it is im­por­tant that we tweak our of­fer­ings to meet mar­ket needs,” she said.</p>
    <p>The buf­fet strat­egy is work­ing. The restau­rant has seen its lunch busi­ness re­cover by al­most 40 per cent after an ini­tial dras­tic drop from the loss of cor­po­rate din­ers and tourists.</p>
    <p>While Ma­jes­tic Bay said it will even­tu­ally dis­con­tinue its one-forone dim sum deal as that is not its in­tended “cui­sine con­cept” and brand po­si­tion­ing, Red House has no plans to stop its buf­fet.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Heng: “Through the dim sum and seafood a la carte buf­fet, we man­aged to pivot our busi­ness while stay­ing true to our com­mit­ment to qual­ity food. This al­lows cus­tomers to en­joy our food at more pocket-friendly prices.”</p>
    <p>Chi­nese restau­rant chain Peach Gar­den also started its high tea buf­fet with dim sum last year in what has turned out to be a pre­scient move.</p>
    <p>The buf­fet is avail­able at its Thom­son Plaza branch on week­ends and its Chi­na­town Point out­let daily. Prices start at $38 on weekdays and $42 on week­ends.</p>
    <p>There is also a 50 per cent dis­count off buf­fet prices on weekdays and 40 per cent off on week­ends, mak­ing this likely the best dim sum deal in town for a premier restau­rant brand.</p>
    <p>Its other out­lets at Mi­ra­mar Ho­tel, OCBC Cen­tre and Me­trop­o­lis do not have buf­fets, but of­fer dis­counts rang­ing from 20 to 50 per cent for a la carte dim sum.</p>
    <p>Its spokesman said: “The high tea works out to less than $20 a per­son. This is lower than the av­er­age check of $25 a per­son for a la carte dim sum or­ders.”</p>
    <p>This at­tracts cus­tomers who are not look­ing for a fill­ing meal, but rather, a hearty snack, she added.</p>
    <p>There are 12 dim sum items in the buf­fet, with pop­u­lar items like baked “bo lo” bun with char siew and pineap­ple, steamed dumpling in Sichuan style and baked mini egg tarts. The menu is re­viewed ev­ery quar­ter, with some items changed.</p>
    <p>These dim sum pro­mo­tions have helped the group in­crease rev­enue by about 30 per cent, mainly from women in their 30s to 50s who go with fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>Re­sponse has been grow­ing steadily, so the pro­mo­tions are likely to re­main a per­ma­nent fea­ture, said the spokesman.</p>
    <p>Even the newly opened Tang Lung Restau­rant at Robert­son Quay is bank­ing on a dim sum a la carte buf­fet to draw cus­tomers on Sun­day af­ter­noons.</p>
    <p>It is priced at $26.80 a per­son, and for this month, one dines free with ev­ery two pay­ing adults.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese restau­rant has items such as pineap­ple char siew tart and pork siew mai with salted egg yolk.</p>
