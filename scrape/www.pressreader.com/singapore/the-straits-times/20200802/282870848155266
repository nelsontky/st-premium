    <p>Build­ing solid fi­nan­cial foun­da­tions through in­vest­ing for the long term is something that has stood Mr Lau­rent Bertrand in good stead over the years.</p>
    <p>He also hopes to help oth­ers re­duce fi­nan­cial anx­i­ety through de­vel­op­ing their own fi­nan­cial-plan­ning road maps.</p>
    <p>Mr Bertrand, 47, is the founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of fin­tech firm Bet­terTradeOf­f, which helps peo­ple build fi­nan­cial plans on­line.</p>
    <p>The busi­ness started here in 2015 and has since raised more than $10 mil­lion in three fund­ing rounds.</p>
    <p>He said: “We started Bet­terTradeOf­f with the be­lief that we could lever­age tech­nol­ogy to pro­vide peo­ple with a means of mak­ing bet­ter decisions re­gard­ing their fi­nan­cial fu­ture, in a way that was easy enough for ev­ery­one to do it.”</p>
    <p>The busi­ness started as a B2B so­lu­tion for fi­nan­cial ad­vis­ers, and an end-con­sumer ver­sion called Up was launched last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Up has nearly 10,000 users now.</p>
    <p>For Mr Bertrand, cre­at­ing a sound fi­nan­cial plan is also something close to his heart, hav­ing weath­ered the fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2008 with a new­born baby then.</p>
    <p>“Keep­ing a long-term per­spec­tive and com­mit­ment helped, but it wasn’t easy to make dif­fi­cult decisions. Should I re­duce my life in­sur­ance to re­duce cost? What would hap­pen to my fam­ily then?</p>
    <p>“That ex­pe­ri­ence con­vinced me that I should try to help peo­ple make bet­ter fi­nan­cial decisions.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bertrand, a French­man and Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent, is mar­ried to a Korean artist.</p>
    <p>They have two chil­dren, aged 12 and 16.</p>
    <p>He has a mas­ter’s de­gree in busi­ness ad­min­is­tra­tion from Insead and another mas­ter’s in physics.</p>
    <p>He started his ca­reer as the head of in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy with cos­met­ics firm L’Oreal, before work­ing with a con­sult­ing firm and banks.</p>
    <p>Q What’s the next stage of growth for your busi­nesses?</p>
    <p>A Fol­low­ing sev­eral suc­cess­ful pi­lots with ma­jor global in­sti­tu­tions, we’re now work­ing on long-term li­cens­ing deals and part­ner­ships that will al­low us to bring our so­lu­tion to new coun­tries and a vast num­ber of new cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>We have also signed sev­eral lead­ing fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory firms to our ad­viser plat­form, and added a well-re­spected for­mer ad­viser to our ex­ec­u­tive team to con­tinue to ex­pand this im­por­tant pil­lar of our busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, we have Up, a plat­form which con­tin­ues to grow in Sin­ga­pore. We con­tinue to im­prove and ex­pand this so­lu­tion in Sin­ga­pore, while de­vel­op­ing it for launch in new mar­kets later this year.</p>
    <p>The ob­jec­tive is to demon­strate our abil­ity to scale all as­pects of our busi­ness, while gen­er­at­ing re­cur­ring rev­enue quickly before en­ter­ing the United States, the largest and most com­pet­i­tive mar­ket for fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 neg­a­tively im­pact­ing so many peo­ple, es­pe­cially the poor­est, we also hope to make our so­lu­tion avail­able in coun­tries like the Philip­pines, where we feel we can have an even greater im­pact on peo­ple’s lives and so­ci­ety as a whole.</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your port­fo­lio?</p>
    <p>A Most of my wealth is tied to my com­pany. As an an­gel in­vestor, I’ve also in­vested in other tech star­tups, like MyRepub­lic. My port­fo­lio is mostly in eq­uity with stocks, funds and ex­change-traded funds. Re­gard­ing prop­erty, I in­vest through real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts which pro­vide good in­come, di­ver­si­fi­ca­tion and liq­uid­ity. My par­ents in­vested in prop­er­ties and did quite well. I just hap­pen to have bet­ter op­por­tu­ni­ties with my own com­pany at this stage.</p>
    <p>Q How did you get in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing?</p>
    <p>A With the change of the re­tire­ment mech­a­nism in Swe­den, where I was at the time, sud­denly I had to choose where to in­vest 2 per cent of my salary. I de­cided to in­vest in In­ter­net and mo­bile tech­nol­ogy. And if I’m not mis­taken, the date for the first in­vest­ment was at the peak of the tech bub­ble. I was trav­el­ling a lot and the head­lines were all talk­ing about the bub­ble burst­ing. Some­how, I made the link be­tween the news and my in­vest­ment only when I re­ceived an or­ange en­ve­lope with the state­ments in­side. I had lost 60 per cent of my re­tire­ment sav­ings in a few months. Fol­low­ing this shock, I de­cided to study in­vest­ing more se­ri­ously and be­gan read­ing any book I could find on the sub­ject.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A I fo­cus on in­vest­ing with a longterm view on busi­nesses that solve im­por­tant prob­lems at scale and thus have a pos­i­tive macro im­pact. Ul­ti­mately, you in­vest in the peo­ple that make it hap­pen. Thanks to my ca­reer and in­ter­est in tech, I have been for­tu­nate to meet and col­lab­o­rate with many ex­tra­or­di­nary peo­ple. Some of them in­vested with me, some of them joined us.</p>
    <p>More tra­di­tion­ally, I also in­vest ev­ery month in eq­uity in­dex funds for my re­tire­ment to ben­e­fit from dol­lar-cost av­er­ag­ing and, most im­por­tantly, from com­pound­ing. Many peo­ple don’t un­der­stand how in­vest­ing over the long term can make a dif­fer­ence. I try not to think too much about it or time the mar­ket. I do in­vest in sin­gle stocks from time to time when I have strong con­vic­tion. In such cases, I make sure the amount is big enough to make a dif­fer­ence, but small enough that I can afford to be wrong.</p>
    <p>It also helps to be able to vi­su­alise how time can help you build wealth even if you start late.</p>
    <p>Buy­ing a prop­erty is also on the hori­zon – not hav­ing to make rental pay­ments is es­pe­cially im­por­tant when you don’t have in­come from salary at re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>Q What else is in your fi­nan­cial plan? A I come from a fam­ily where, short of un­fore­see­able ac­ci­dents, we die of old age and gen­er­ally in good health. How­ever, wit­ness­ing the im­pact of my grand­mother’s de­men­tia on my mother who was car­ing for her, we have made sure that we have suit­able legacy plan­ning in place, in­clud­ing a will and Last­ing Power of At­tor­ney.</p>
    <p>I use our so­lu­tion, Up, to keep track of all our ac­counts, as­sets and in­sur­ance poli­cies.</p>
    <p>It’s also eas­ier now that there is an ac­count ag­gre­ga­tion ser­vice to keep the plan up­dated.</p>
    <p>Q How are you plan­ning for re­tire­ment?</p>
    <p>A I use Up to es­ti­mate how much money I will need when re­tir­ing. Like 80 per cent of Sin­ga­pore­ans, I’d like to main­tain the same life­style I have now. But the truth is, our spend­ing pat­terns – like health­care costs and fam­ily com­po­si­tion – change with age. If you fac­tor in in­fla­tion by the var­i­ous ex­pense cat­e­gories, fig­ur­ing out how much is needed can be quite com­plex. I un­der­es­ti­mated my ex­penses by 40 per cent.</p>
    <p>Like many, my as­pi­ra­tion is fi­nan­cial in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>Q Money-wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A My par­ents were en­trepreneur­s and, from a young age, I wit­nessed them work­ing very long hours. I re­mem­ber my grand­par­ents tak­ing care of me and my sis­ter for three years to help them.</p>
    <p>My fa­ther was a gifted jeweller, but it was my mother who was the driv­ing force be­hind the busi­ness. She has an in­nate sense of busi­ness and in­no­va­tion. At the time when shop own­ers were trav­el­ling to Paris to visit jew­ellery de­sign­ers and pro­duc­ers, she or­gan­ised trade rep­re­sen­ta­tive tours. She also de­vel­oped a pri­vate cus­tomer base of high-net­worth in­di­vid­u­als. I was very for­tu­nate to have such role mod­els.</p>
    <p>Q Home is now...</p>
    <p>A We rent a con­do­minium apart­ment near the Botanic Gar­dens. While rel­a­tively old by Sin­ga­pore stan­dards, we love the place, the sur­round­ings and our friendly neigh­bours. It’s a big place with lots of nat­u­ral light – which are both im­por­tant for my wife, who is a painter.</p>
    <p>Q I drive...</p>
    <p>A My first car was my fa­ther’s car, a Volvo 240 with over 600,000km! I still drive a Volvo, this time a red XC60 with much less mileage on the odome­ter.</p>
