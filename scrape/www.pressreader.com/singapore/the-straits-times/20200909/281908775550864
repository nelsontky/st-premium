    <p>LONDON • Bri­tain headed into a fresh round of Brexit trade talks yes­ter­day, ac­knowl­edg­ing it could break in­ter­na­tional law but only in “a lim­ited way” af­ter re­ports say­ing it may un­der­cut its di­vorce treaty with the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>As the pound fell on fears of a nodeal exit, the gov­ern­ment’s le­gal depart­ment head quit be­cause he felt a plan to over­write parts of the with­drawal agree­ment treaty signed in Jan­uary was wrong.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain left the EU on Jan 31, but trade talks have made lit­tle head­way as the clock ticks down to an Oct 15 dead­line and then the end of the sta­tus quo tran­si­tion ar­range­ment in late De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>As diplo­mats gauged whether Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son was blus­ter­ing or se­ri­ous about al­low­ing a tu­mul­tuous fi­nale to the fouryear saga, Bri­tain in­sisted it would abide by the treaty.</p>
    <p>Asked if any­thing in the pro­posed leg­is­la­tion po­ten­tially breached in­ter­na­tional le­gal obli­ga­tions or ar­range­ments, Min­is­ter for North­ern Ire­land Bran­don Lewis said: “Yes, this does break in­ter­na­tional law in a very spe­cific and lim­ited way.”</p>
    <p>“We are tak­ing the pow­ers to dis­ap­ply the EU law con­cept of di­rect ef­fect re­quired by Ar­ti­cle 4 in a cer­tain, very tightly de­fined cir­cum­stance,” he told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>He added that the gov­ern­ment sup­ported the North­ern Ire­land pro­to­col of the with­drawal agree­ment.</p>
    <p>Amid EU warn­ings that if Bri­tain re­neged on the di­vorce deal there would be no trade agree­ment, for­mer prime min­is­ter Theresa May told the gov­ern­ment it risked se­ri­ous dam­age to its in­ter­na­tional im­age. “How can the gov­ern­ment re­as­sure fu­ture in­ter­na­tional part­ners that the UK can be trusted to abide by the le­gal obli­ga­tions of the agree­ments it signs?” Mrs May, who re­signed af­ter her Brexit deal was re­peat­edly re­jected, told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>The Fi­nan­cial Times said the gov­ern­ment’s “very un­happy” le­gal head Jonathan Jones walked out in protest over the pos­si­ble plan to un­der­cut the with­drawal agree­ment in re­la­tion to the pro­to­col for Bri­tish-ruled North­ern Ire­land.</p>
    <p>The prospect of a messy di­vorce be­tween the EU’s US$16 tril­lion (S$22 tril­lion) and the United King­dom’s US$3 tril­lion economies pushed ster­ling to two-week lows.</p>
    <p>The lat­est round of ne­go­ti­a­tions in London is likely to be tough: Bri­tain says the EU has failed to un­der­stand it is now in­de­pen­dent – es­pe­cially when it comes to fish­ing and state aid. The EU says it needs specifics from London and that Bri­tain can­not make its own rules and have pref­er­en­tial ac­cess to its mar­kets.</p>
