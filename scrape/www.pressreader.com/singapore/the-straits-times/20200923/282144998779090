    <p>A rub­bish chute might not be the most pho­to­genic ob­ject, but sec­ondary school maths teacher Keith Wee saw a golden op­por­tu­nity when he found his six-year-old daugh­ter Kei danc­ing next to the chute out­side his flat one af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee, 38, who cap­tured the mo­ment on his dig­i­tal cam­era, said: “She takes dance lessons and used her shadow on the floor to check her move­ments while prac­tis­ing... I re­alised that even com­mon spa­ces like a cor­ri­dor can be places where they can work on their dreams.”</p>
    <p>The im­age is among more than 1,000 con­tri­bu­tions so far to the Shapes Of Home con­test – a col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the Hous­ing Board and Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings’ Pho­ton­ico plat­form, to cel­e­brate the HDB’s 60th an­niver­sary. These en­tries were sub­mit­ted on the Pho­ton­ico web­site and on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee has also sub­mit­ted four other im­ages de­pict­ing the ar­chi­tec­ture and heart­land life near his five-room Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flat in Pung­gol and his par­ents’ home in Tampines.</p>
    <p>Mr Wee, whose wife Amy, 39, is a client ser­vice man­ager, picked up pho­tog­ra­phy to doc­u­ment his chil­dren’s grow­ing-up years.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Daniel Tan, 37, finds in­spi­ra­tion on his daily walks to get break­fast at a nearby cof­fee shop be­fore he starts his work day at home. Mr Tan, who car­ries a dig­i­tal cam­era wher­ever he goes, no­ticed a woman work­ing out alone at an ex­er­cise cor­ner on Sept 14.</p>
    <p>The mo­ment spoke of how per­sonal space can be carved out of crowded places, he said. It was an added bonus that her pink shirt matched the colours of the blocks of HDB flats in the back­ground. He up­loaded the photo on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>“How of­ten do you see pock­ets of space in a play­ground or park? The in­ter­est­ing thing is that she had flats be­hind her, and it’s of­ten crowded in the heart­land, yet she had all the space to her­self,” said Mr Tan, who works in cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions and lives with his wife in a three-room BTO flat in Tampines.</p>
    <p>Mr Soh Eng Kien, 34, used his new drone to cap­ture a bird’s-eye view of the Sengkang Sculp­ture Park near Sengkang MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>He lives in River­vale Drive and has passed the park many times in the past 20 years while tak­ing the LRT. But the drone gave the tech­ni­cal of­fi­cer in the con­struc­tion in­dus­try a new per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic are in­vited to share what home means to them in ei­ther of two cat­e­gories: green and dis­tinc­tive HDB de­signs, and heart­land mo­ments. Sub­mis­sions close on Oct 16.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times photo ed­i­tor Stephanie Yeow, who is on the panel of judges, said the con­test has drawn a good num­ber of en­tries, mostly ar­chi­tec­tural.</p>
    <p>“While shape and form can be beau­ti­ful, we hope to see more im­ages with the hu­man el­e­ment, ones that cap­ture the spirit of liv­ing in a com­mu­nity within pub­lic hous­ing, in­ter­ac­tions and ac­tiv­i­ties that make HDB liv­ing unique.”</p>
    <p>She added that the judges are look­ing for pic­tures that have an ex­tra spe­cial com­po­nent that will catch their eye and stand out.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Mr Soh Eng Kien took this photo of the Sengkang Sculp&#xAD;ture Park near Sengkang MRT sta&#xAD;tion us&#xAD;ing a drone. He says: &#x201C;My ac&#xAD;tual in&#xAD;ten&#xAD;tion was to cap&#xAD;ture the in&#xAD;ter&#xAD;twin&#xAD;ing LRT tracks from di&#xAD;rectly above them and I didn&#x2019;t no&#xAD;tice the park be&#xAD;low or the&#xD;&#xA;HDB blocks in the back&#xAD;ground un&#xAD;til I flew the drone back to me. I saw from my screen how the colours of the park and blocks would liven up my photo if they&#x2019;re in it.&#x201D;</p>
