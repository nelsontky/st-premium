    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has con­demned protests in Port­land, Ore­gon, and vi­o­lence in “Demo­crat-run” cities as his Repub­li­can ad­min­is­tra­tion moves to in­ter­vene in ur­ban cen­tres that he says have lost con­trol of anti-racism protests. Af­ter a chaotic night of clashes in Port­land, Mr Trump and the city’s mayor traded barbs over who was to blame for the es­ca­lat­ing un­rest.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump over the week­end fu­elled spec­u­la­tion he would not ac­cept the re­sult if he were to lose in Novem­ber’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>In an of­ten testy in­ter­view with Fox News host Chris Wal­lace, aired on Sun­day, Mr Trump was asked di­rectly if he would ac­cept a loss. The Pres­i­dent replied: “I will have to see.”</p>
    <p>“Look, you – I have to see. No, I’m not go­ing to just say ‘yes’. I’m not go­ing to say ‘no’ and I didn’t last time ei­ther,” Mr Trump said.</p>
    <p>Mr Wal­lace asked the Pres­i­dent at one point whether he was</p>
    <p>“a good loser”. He re­sponded by say­ing that he was not.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent also re­peated what he said in re­cent weeks and months – that he thinks mail-in vot­ing will be li­able to fraud to rig the Nov 3 elec­tion. “I think mail-in vot­ing is go­ing to rig the elec­tion. I re­ally do,” he said.</p>
    <p>It was in that con­text that Mr Wal­lace asked the di­rect ques­tion about los­ing the vote.</p>
    <p>The idea that Pres­i­dent Trump may not ac­cept the re­sult if he loses – and espe­cially if he loses nar­rowly – has been gain­ing ground in Wash­ing­ton, in­clud­ing in diplo­matic cir­cles, for some weeks as he has ramped up con­cerns about al­leged rig­ging.</p>
    <p>On June 22, for ex­am­ple, Mr Trump tweeted that the elec­tion would be rigged, with “mil­lions of mail-in bal­lots… printed by for­eign coun­tries, and oth­ers”.</p>
    <p>But an­a­lysts have said there is no rea­son to be­lieve that mail-in bal­lots, while as­sum­ing more im­por­tance as the on­go­ing Covid-19 pan­demic could af­fect phys­i­cal turnout at the polls, will lead to a rigged elec­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, that the Pres­i­dent’s own words in­di­cate he could refuse to ac­cept the re­sult if he loses makes such a sce­nario plau­si­ble, even if still im­prob­a­ble.</p>
    <p>If it were to tran­spire, it would be both a test of the strength and re­silience of US in­sti­tu­tions, and a test of which vi­sion of Amer­ica will ul­ti­mately pre­vail.</p>
    <p>To be sure, talk does not mean ac­tion. Pres­i­dent Trump is adept at cre­at­ing ten­sion and dis­trac­tion. In fact, in 2016, dur­ing a cam­paign de­bate with his ri­val Hil­lary Clin­ton, when asked – also by Mr Wal­lace, who was one of the mod­er­a­tors – he also said: “I will tell you at the time.</p>
    <p>I’ll keep you in sus­pense.”</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, Mr An­drew Bates, a spokesman for Mr Trump’s pre­sump­tive Demo­cratic Party ri­val Joe Bi­den, who cur­rently leads Mr Trump in a num­ber of opin­ion polls, said: “The Amer­i­can peo­ple will de­cide this elec­tion. And the United States gov­ern­ment is per­fectly ca­pa­ble of es­cort­ing tres­passers out of the White House.”</p>
    <p>Many an­a­lysts be­lieve the</p>
    <p>US is head­ing to­wards the most volatile elec­tion in its mod­ern his­tory. “If this elec­tion were be­ing run in an­other coun­try, there’s a pretty high like­li­hood that Amer­i­cans would be say­ing ‘we need to send in ob­servers’,” Mr Ian Brem­mer, chief ex­ec­u­tive and founder of The Eura­sia Group, told MSNBC last week.</p>
    <p>Still, a par­tic­u­lar strength and re­silience of the US is peace­ful tran­si­tion of power.</p>
    <p>Twenty years ago, the in­fa­mous Florida re­count was, af­ter some five weeks of wran­gling, set­tled by a Supreme Court rul­ing – and Demo­cratic Party can­di­date Al Gore, who had ear­lier been tipped as the win­ner (and won the pop­u­lar vote), had to ac­cept the de­ci­sion and his Repub­li­can ri­val Ge­orge W. Bush be­came pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>“The sys­tem would make fast work of any pres­i­dent who at­tempted to deny the re­sults of the elec­tion,” Pro­fes­sor Jonathan</p>
    <p>Tur­ley of the Ge­orge Wash­ing­ton Univer­sity Law School told Politico late last month.</p>
    <p>But oth­ers are not so sure. Last month, Amherst Col­lege law pro­fes­sor Lawrence Douglas told Vox : “We have a pres­i­dent of the United States who has pretty con­sis­tently and ag­gres­sively tele­graphed his in­ten­tion not to con­cede in the face of an elec­toral de­feat, espe­cially if that elec­toral de­feat is of a very nar­row mar­gin.</p>
    <p>“And it looks like it prob­a­bly will be a nar­row mar­gin. In all like­li­hood, the 2020 elec­tion is go­ing to turn on the re­sults in prob­a­bly the three swing states that de­ter­mined the re­sults in 2016: Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and Wis­con­sin.”</p>
