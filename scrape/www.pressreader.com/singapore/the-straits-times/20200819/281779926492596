    <p>The Jobs Growth In­cen­tive will help com­pa­nies get very sub­stan­tial sav­ings on their wage bill, al­low­ing them to be bolder in man­power ex­pan­sion and bring for­ward hir­ing, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She added: “As Sin­ga­pore grad­u­ally re­opens our econ­omy and bor­ders, some sec­tors will re­cover faster than oth­ers, some may be com­pletely trans­formed. Com­pa­nies will there­fore have to pivot, to po­si­tion them­selves better for the post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>“This means new jobs open­ing up in some ar­eas even as oth­ers see job losses. In the grow­ing ar­eas, we want to nudge em­ploy­ers to hire and also train Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>The scheme helps stretch bud­gets for man­power growth to cre­ate more good jobs, she said.</p>
    <p>Take a com­pany with 10 lo­cal staff on av­er­age from Jan­uary to Au­gust, which then has two new hires in Septem­ber. These two new lo­cal hires can at­tract salary sup­port of 25 per cent for the next 12 months for the first $5,000 of their salary.</p>
    <p>If one of them is 45 years old, the salary sup­port for the worker will dou­ble to 50 per cent, which means up to $45,000 in to­tal for both of them. This is on top of the Jobs Sup­port Scheme help for all 12 staff.</p>
    <p>The firm must main­tain a lo­cal work­force of more than 10 to re­ceive the in­cen­tive for the full 12 months. The to­tal pay­out is re­duced pro­por­tion­ally any time some­one from the orig­i­nal team leaves.</p>
    <p>This means if one of the orig­i­nal 10 work­ers leaves the firm in Oc­to­ber and a third lo­cal is hired as re­place­ment, the firm will get the in­cen­tive for all three new lo­cal hires, but at a 90 per cent rate, as the orig­i­nal work­force shrank by 10 per cent. “That is fair, so com­pa­nies don’t just ben­e­fit from a re­place­ment spree,” Mrs Teo said.</p>
