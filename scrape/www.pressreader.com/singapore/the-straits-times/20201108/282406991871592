    <p>WHERE Stall 2, Block 4 Defu Lane 10 OPEN Mon­days to Satur­days, 11.30am to 9pm; closed on Sun­days</p>
    <p>TEL 8236-8031/8798-3903</p>
    <p>Lo­cated off the beaten track in a Defu Lane in­dus­trial can­teen, Pong Cheer Cheer Thai Food at­tracts a steady crowd of bluecol­lar work­ers from the vicin­ity.</p>
    <p>It is not where you would ex­pect to find de­li­cious Thai food, but the kway chap here makes it a place worth vis­it­ing.</p>
    <p>To keep prices af­ford­able, es­pe­cially in the pan­demic, stall owner Nachatchad­a­porn Sir­imueang, 38, re­cently re­duced the price of the</p>
    <p>Thai Kway Chap from $5 to $4 a bowl.</p>
    <p>It is a huge bowl too, filled to the brim with large pieces of deep­fried tau kee (dried bean­curd skin), chunks of braised pork trot­ter meat, thick slices of fried pork skin and shi­itake mush­room.</p>
    <p>The kway is thin, smooth and ten­der. The fried gar­lic-ac­cented soup is nat­u­rally sweet with the gen­er­ous use of radish.</p>
    <p>The soup is also slightly pep­pery – to cater to the lo­cal palate – and aro­matic with fresh co­rian­der, huai shan (Chi­nese wild yam) and lo­tus seeds.</p>
    <p>Ms Nachatchad­a­porn, who is known to her cus­tomers as Ploy, is a Thai-Chi­nese from Nong Khai prov­ince in Isan, north-east Thai­land. Her mother is of the Teochew di­alect group and in­flu­enced her love of braised pork trot­ters.</p>
    <p>A must-try is the stall’s new dish, Khao Khoonchi­ang, which is rice with sausage or Lap Cheong Fan ($5).</p>
    <p>It will be avail­able from Fri­day in lim­ited quan­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>The thin slices of pan-fried sausage are crispy at the edges, springy and flavour­some on the in­side, with­out be­ing overly oily or salty.</p>
    <p>They are served with braised caixin and a large por­tion of jas­mine rice.</p>
