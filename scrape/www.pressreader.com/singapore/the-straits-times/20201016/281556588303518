    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the 146,000 pub­lic ser­vants here will be able to ac­cess the In­ter­net se­curely with­out the need for a sep­a­rate de­vice come Nov 2, thanks to a new re­mote brows­ing tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tion. Se­cure In­ter­net Surf­ing will al­low pub­lic ser­vants to use their work lap­tops when surf­ing the In­ter­net for in­for­ma­tion.</p>

    <p>GOV­ERN­MENT GROUP, on the new Se­cure In­ter­net Surf­ing so­lu­tion and the cur­rent model of In­ter­net surf­ing sep­a­ra­tion for pub­lic ser­vants.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the 146,000 pub­lic ser­vants here will be able to ac­cess the In­ter­net se­curely with­out the need for a sep­a­rate de­vice come Nov 2, thanks to a new re­mote brows­ing tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Se­cure In­ter­net Surf­ing (SIS) will al­low pub­lic ser­vants to use their work lap­tops when surf­ing the In­ter­net for in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>They will also be able to log in to so­cial me­dia sites to make textbased posts, as well as open links di­rectly from e-mails and doc­u­ments, the Smart Nation and Dig­i­tal Gov­ern­ment Group (SNDGG) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>SIS re­places the cur­rent model of In­ter­net surf­ing sep­a­ra­tion (ISS), which delinks pub­lic ser­vants’ work sys­tems from In­ter­net ac­cess to safe­guard gov­ern­ment data.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 108,000 pub­lic ser­vants will move over to SIS, with about 18,000 who have to han­dle clas­si­fied in­for­ma­tion con­tin­u­ing to use a sep­a­rate de­vice.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 20,000 are not un­der In­ter­net surf­ing sep­a­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>SNDGG said the roll-out of SIS, which was made pos­si­ble by re­cent ad­vances in re­mote brows­ing tech­nol­ogy, will im­prove pro­duc­tiv­ity</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ent com­bi­na­tions of tech­nolo­gies can now be im­ple­mented to­gether to pro­vide mul­ti­ple lay­ers of se­cu­rity con­trol, and for us to have in place a more ad­vanced and se­cure sys­tem to safe­guard gov­ern­ment data.</p>
    <p>across the pub­lic ser­vice.</p>
    <p>It will also re­duce the costs of up­grad­ing or main­tain­ing ad­di­tional In­ter­net-ac­ces­si­ble ma­chines.</p>
    <p>“Dif­fer­ent com­bi­na­tions of tech­nolo­gies can now be im­ple­mented to­gether to pro­vide mul­ti­ple lay­ers of se­cu­rity con­trol, and for us to have in place a more ad­vanced and se­cure sys­tem to safe­guard gov­ern­ment data,” SNDGG said.</p>
    <p>Re­mote brows­ing tech­nol­ogy works by cre­at­ing an iso­lated con­tainer, which han­dles all In­ter­net con­tent ac­cessed by the user and pre­vents di­rect in­ter­ac­tion be­tween gov­ern­ment sys­tems and mal­ware or viruses lurk­ing on the</p>
    <p>In­ter­net.</p>
    <p>The con­tainer can also be con­fig­ured to fil­ter out cer­tain types of con­tent deemed un­safe, to fur­ther re­duce the risks of mal­ware in­fec­tion and data theft.</p>
    <p>Pub­lic ser­vants on SIS will also be able to up­load files to the In­ter­net, but only to ap­proved web­sites.</p>
    <p>ISS was launched in 2016 and rolled out fully across the pub­lic ser­vice in 2017.</p>
    <p>SNDGG said ISS was i mple­mented as there were no “suit­able ma­ture” so­lu­tions or prod­ucts at the time to en­able pub­lic ser­vants to ac­cess the In­ter­net se­curely.</p>
    <p>It was also in­tro­duced on a tem­po­rary ba­sis across all pub­lic health­care in­sti­tu­tions in 2018, fol­low­ing a SingHealth breach that in­volved the data of 1.5 mil­lion pa­tients and is Sin­ga­pore’s worst cy­ber at­tack to date.</p>
    <p>An In­te­grated Health In­for­ma­tion Sys­tems spokesman said yes­ter­day that the pub­lic health­care sec­tor is work­ing to im­ple­ment a sim­i­lar so­lu­tion to SIS, with test­ing and eval­u­a­tion al­ready com­pleted.</p>
    <p>“Due to the sen­si­tive na­ture of health­care sys­tems, the im­ple­men­ta­tion plan is cur­rently be­ing re­viewed by the rel­e­vant au­thor­i­ties,” the spokesman said.</p>
