    <p>•</p>
    <p>LA PAZ (Bo­livia) Vot­ers in Bo­livia ex­pect so­cial up­heaval for the sec­ond time in a year, no mat­ter who wins yes­ter­day’s gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>For the first time in 20 years, the elec­tion does not fea­ture for­mer pres­i­dent Evo Mo­rales.</p>
    <p>It comes a year af­ter Mr Mo­rales won an un­con­sti­tu­tional fourth term in an elec­tion that sparked weeks of protests.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­rales, who re­signed and fled into ex­ile, is barred from tak­ing part, but his suc­ces­sor as leader of the Move­ment for So­cial­ism (MAS) party, Mr Luis Arce, has topped ev­ery opin­ion poll since he was nom­i­nated in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions have been run­ning high, with MAS warn­ing of a pend­ing “fraud” and threat­en­ing to protest should they not get their way, while mis­in­for­ma­tion has been cir­cu­lat­ing freely.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously there will be so­cial up­heaval... we just hope it won’t last long,” Ms Clara Quitalba, 49, from the MAS bas­tion of El Alto on the out­skirts of La Paz, told AFP.</p>
    <p>Last year, protests broke out against Mr Mo­rales’ vic­tory fol­low­ing a 24-hour halt in the live vote count that saw the in­cum­bent’s lead jump dra­mat­i­cally once it re­sumed. A later au­dit by the Or­gan­i­sa­tion of Amer­i­can States found clear ev­i­dence of fraud.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully it will be calm be­cause we don’t want to go through what hap­pened last year. It was ter­ri­ble,” said Ms Re­nata Za­p­ata, 24, in La Paz.</p>
    <p>The protests did not end with Mr Mo­rales’ ex­ile, as his sup­port­ers took to the streets in turn. The un­rest left 36 dead and 800 in­jured.</p>
    <p>Mr Arce was ex­pected to win yes­ter­day’s first round, but the ques­tion is whether the 57-year-old can achieve the re­quired 40 per cent with a 10-point lead to avoid a runoff.</p>
    <p>Sur­veys sug­gest cen­trist for­mer pres­i­dent Car­los Mesa, 67, will take enough votes to en­sure there is a run-off, which he would be ex­pected to win, with the other four can­di­dates likely to then en­dorse him.</p>
    <p>“While the mar­gin will be close, we re­main of the view that Mesa will take the race to a Nov 29 runoff, which he would be favoured to win,” said Eura­sia Group’s an­a­lyst for Brazil and Bo­livia, Mr Filipe Grup­pelli Car­valho.</p>
    <p>But there is rea­son to be hope­ful of a re­turn to democ­racy and sta­bil­ity af­ter Mr Mo­rales tried to hold on to power de­spite the Con­sti­tu­tion lim­it­ing a pres­i­dent to two suc­ces­sive terms.</p>
    <p>“It’s the end of a cy­cle of the Evo Mo­rales gov­ern­ment and the po­lit­i­cal cri­sis,” po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist Car­los Cordero from the Catholic Univer­sity told AFP.</p>
    <p>Mr Mo­rales, Bo­livia’s first in­dige­nous pres­i­dent, ruled for nearly 14 years.</p>
    <p>“We hope a process to strengthen the (po­lit­i­cal) in­sti­tu­tions will be­gin,” added Mr Cordero.</p>
