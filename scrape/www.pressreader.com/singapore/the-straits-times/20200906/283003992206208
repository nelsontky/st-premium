    <p>Pro­tec­tion­ist calls to re­serve em­ploy­ment for lo­cals are get­ting louder in some In­dian states as provin­cial gov­ern­ments try to com­bat ris­ing unem­ploy­ment while en­sur­ing labour mo­bil­ity, which is es­sen­tial for eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>Mad­hya Pradesh Chief Min­is­ter Shivraj Singh Chouhan an­nounced last month that all govern­ment jobs would be re­served for “the chil­dren of Mad­hya Pradesh”. The Haryana govern­ment also plans to in­tro­duce a Bill in the state assem­bly in an ef­fort to re­serve 75 per cent of all pri­vate-sec­tor jobs for the state’s youth.</p>
    <p>Even Ma­ha­rash­tra, which serves as a key des­ti­na­tion for mi­grants, wants to bring in a law that would se­cure 80 per cent of jobs in lo­cal in­dus­tries for res­i­dents of the state.</p>
    <p>In July, the Ma­ha­rash­tra govern­ment launched a jobs por­tal to con­nect work­ers with prospec­tive em­ploy­ers, but it re­quires ap­pli­cants to show proof of res­i­dence in the state.</p>
    <p>Many ex­perts fear that such pro­tec­tion­ist moves could mul­ti­ply amid the on­go­ing eco­nomic cri­sis brought on by the Covid-19 pan­demic at a time when mi­grants are headed back to the cities af­ter be­ing forced to re­turn to their vil­lages by the lockdown im­posed in March.</p>
    <p>The In­dian econ­omy con­tracted by 23.9 per cent in the April to June quar­ter – the high­est con­trac­tion since In­dia be­gan main­tain­ing quar­terly records in 1996.</p>
    <p>Unem­ploy­ment reached 8.35 per cent last month, up from 7.43 per cent in July, ac­cord­ing to data from the Cen­tre for Mon­i­tor­ing In­dian Econ­omy. It had peaked in April at 23.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre es­ti­mates that around 19 mil­lion salaried, for­mal econ­omy jobs have been lost af­ter the lockdown.</p>
    <p>While the pan­demic has dealt a se­vere blow to the econ­omy, it had al­ready been ail­ing with years of job­less growth. Govern­ment data shows that the labour par­tic­i­pa­tion rate in the work­force – de­fined as the per­cent­age of peo­ple work­ing or seek­ing work among the pop­u­la­tion – fell from 43 per cent in 2004-2005 to 36.9 per cent in 2017-2018. It crept up marginally to 37.5 per cent in 2018-2019.</p>
    <p>A fall­ing labour par­tic­i­pa­tion rate im­plies that a lower pro­por­tion of the work­ing age pop­u­la­tion is will­ing to work. A key rea­son cited for this is a lack of de­sir­able jobs.</p>
    <p>A study by Azim Premji Univer­sity (APU) last month found that em­ploy­ment growth be­tween 2011 and 2017 lagged be­hind pop­u­la­tion growth for both men and women. For in­stance, em­ploy­ment for men aged 25 and above grew at just 60 per cent of the rate of their pop­u­la­tion growth dur­ing that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>“Work is not be­ing made avail­able in pro­por­tion to the peo­ple who are likely to seek work,” said Dr Amit Ba­sole, an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of eco­nomics at APU’s Cen­tre for Sus­tain­able Em­ploy­ment. Over the years, this has re­sulted in not just fall­ing labour par­tic­i­pa­tion rates and ris­ing unem­ploy­ment, but also grow­ing calls for pro­tec­tion­ism that have be­come even louder since the start of the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause the labour mar­ket is stag­nat­ing, it has led to this back­lash – that we all need to look out for our­selves when the pie is not grow­ing,” Dr Ba­sole told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>The Mad­hya Pradesh pro­posal to re­serve all govern­ment jobs for lo­cals is con­tentious as Ar­ti­cle 16 of the In­dian Con­sti­tu­tion guar­an­tees equal treat­ment when it comes to pub­lic em­ploy­ment. Only Par­lia­ment is al­lowed to leg­is­late “pre­scrib­ing” a re­quire­ment of res­i­dence for jobs in a par­tic­u­lar state.</p>
    <p>The move to re­serve pri­vate-sec­tor jobs will meet with dif­fi­cul­ties if al­lowed to go ahead. Firms in In­dia have be­come heav­ily re­liant on mi­grant labour from other states to fill lo­cal sup­ply gaps and work at cheaper rates.</p>
    <p>In 2016, Kar­nataka had pro­posed re­serv­ing all pri­vate-sec­tor jobs that se­cure con­ces­sions from the state, with the ex­cep­tion of jobs in the size­able IT and biotech­nol­ogy in­dus­tries that were re­liant on out­side labour. The move was dropped af­ter wide­spread op­po­si­tion and be­cause of po­ten­tial le­gal com­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Gau­tam Mody, gen­eral-sec­re­tary of the New Trade Union Ini­tia­tive, said such pro­pos­als risk ag­gra­vat­ing ex­ist­ing di­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>“We must ask our­selves again: are we one coun­try, one peo­ple, or are we many peo­ple who are go­ing to be at war with each other for the lim­ited num­ber of jobs by caste, by race, by com­mu­nity, by re­li­gion, by re­gion and by state?” he told ST.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Deepak Sood, sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the As­so­ci­ated Cham­bers of Com­merce and In­dus­try of In­dia, told ST in an e-mail that he did not ex­pect these pro­pos­als to cause “ma­jor dis­rup­tion”.</p>
    <p>He said that such poli­cies ex­clude se­nior man­age­ment and spe­cialised roles as well as the in­for­mal sec­tor, which ac­counts for a large chunk of mi­grant em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>“Most ser­vice in­dus­tries like IT have been per­mit­ted to work with­out any lo­ca­tional re­stric­tions and we be­lieve it would re­main so,” he added.</p>
    <p>While In­dia an­nounced a 20 tril­lion ru­pee (S$372 bil­lion) eco­nomic pack­age in May, in­clud­ing col­lat­eral-free loans and eq­uity in­fu­sion, there have been calls for the govern­ment to put more money into peo­ple’s pock­ets to boost con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>“The govern­ment must in­vest in boost­ing de­mand which will help the pri­vate sec­tor to in­vest. It also must en­sure its own ex­pen­di­ture is ori­ented to­wards cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture for job cre­ation,” said Mr Mody.</p>
    <p>“This is not rocket sci­ence, it is pub­lic pol­icy that has ex­isted on this planet for close to over a cen­tury since the Great De­pres­sion.”</p>
