    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans with more than one bank ac­count will soon be able to view all their funds and in­vest­ments in one place on­line, in­stead of hav­ing to visit each bank or its web­site.</p>
    <p>They can con­sent to share their con­sol­i­dated per­sonal fi­nan­cial data across seven banks – Citibank, POSB and DBS, HSBC, May­bank, OCBC, Stan­dard Char­tered and UOB – and three agen­cies: the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Board, Hous­ing Board and In­land Rev­enue Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (Iras).</p>
    <p>The Straits Times un­der­stands that the Sin­ga­pore Fi­nan­cial Data Ex­change (SGFinDex), an on­line plat­form which takes ref­er­ence from “open bank­ing” in Europe, will be an­nounced soon.</p>
    <p>Open bank­ing is the prac­tice of pro­vid­ing third-party fi­nan­cial ser­vice providers with ac­cess to fi­nan­cial data from banks and non-bank fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>This is done us­ing ap­pli­ca­tion pro­gram­ming in­ter­faces (APIs), or codes that en­able com­puter ap­pli­ca­tions to speak to one an­other. Third par­ties will be able to in­te­grate their ser­vices with those of a bank to cre­ate a bet­ter con­sumer ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Users of SGFinDex will be redi­rected to the SingPass log-in page, af­ter which they can se­lect the fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions they would like to be con­nected to.</p>
    <p>In­for­ma­tion from the CPF Board, Iras and HDB is au­to­mat­i­cally linked via MyInfo when users log in us­ing SingPass.</p>
    <p>Data that can be re­trieved in­clude cur­rent and sav­ings ac­count bal­ances, unit trust hold­ings, CPF In­vest­ment Scheme and Sup­ple­men­tary Re­tire­ment Scheme ac­counts and hold­ings, and loan out­stand­ing bal­ances.</p>
    <p>Af­ter suc­cess­fully link­ing their ac­counts, users are asked for con­sent to their data one more time. The in­for­ma­tion is se­cured with SingPass MyInfo.</p>
    <p>SGFinDex can al­ready be ac­cessed from some banks’ plat­forms, such as DBS’ NAV Plan­ner.</p>
    <p>The bank’s web­site states that as a se­cu­rity mea­sure, the plat­form does not store or have ac­cess to users’ fi­nan­cial data. Also, users are not al­lowed to per­form any trans­ac­tions through the plat­form.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to DBS, more than one mil­lion users have used it to do bud­get­ing and mon­i­tor their in­vest­ment per­for­mance, as well as ob­tain per­son­alised fi­nan­cial in­sights and rec­om­men­da­tions.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lawrence Loh from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness School said the take-up rate for SGFinDex, es­pe­cially at the out­set, would de­pend on how con­sumers weigh the ben­e­fits against the time spent on en­abling ac­cess.</p>
    <p>“The in­cen­tive will be stronger if trans­ac­tions can also be per­formed be­yond the avail­abil­ity of in­for­ma­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Aurobindo Ghosh from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s Lee Kong Chian School of Busi­ness cau­tioned that there may be some kinks at the out­set be­cause of legacy sys­tems in dif­fer­ent banks.</p>
    <p>“The main hur­dle is to have some uni­for­mity or stan­dard­i­s­a­tion of fi­nan­cial ser­vices and pro­to­cols that are uni­ver­sally adopted, in­clud­ing ac­cess to data APIs across dif­fer­ent in­sti­tu­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Data se­cu­rity would also have to be held to a very high stan­dard for th­ese plat­forms to be more widely adopted and to carry in­no­va­tive prod­ucts such as debt con­sol­i­da­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC MP Sak­tiandi Su­paat, who is on the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Fi­nance and Trade and In­dus­try, said SGFinDex al­lows for eas­ier de­lib­er­a­tions on fi­nan­cial plan­ning.</p>
    <p>He added: “For now, the ser­vices avail­able seem lim­ited. But in fu­ture, is­sues about data pri­vacy and who has ac­cess to th­ese data within the part­ner fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions may be an is­sue.”</p>
