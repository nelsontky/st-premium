    <p>A free trade agree­ment be­tween the United King­dom and Sin­ga­pore takes ef­fect from 7am to­day, en­sur­ing that com­pa­nies from both coun­tries con­tinue to en­joy the same trad­ing ben­e­fits even as the United King­dom leaves the tran­si­tion pe­riod for its exit from the Euro­pean Union.</p>
    <p>A free trade agree­ment (FTA) be­tween the United King­dom and Sin­ga­pore takes ef­fect from 7am to­day, en­sur­ing that com­pa­nies from both coun­tries con­tinue to en­joy the same trad­ing ben­e­fits, even as the tran­si­tion pe­riod for the UK’s exit from the Euro­pean Union ends.</p>
    <p>The EU-Sin­ga­pore Free Trade Agree­ment will no longer ap­ply to trade be­tween UK and Sin­ga­pore when the new deal kicks in, the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Both coun­tries have com­pleted their re­spec­tive do­mes­tic pro­ce­dures for the FTA’s pro­vi­sional ap­pli­ca­tion, which en­ables them to ap­ply treaty com­mit­ments on a pro­vi­sional ba­sis un­til the FTA is rat­i­fied by both sides and en­ters into force.</p>
    <p>The UK is Sin­ga­pore’s third and se­cond largest trad­ing part­ner for goods and ser­vices, re­spec­tively, as well as its top in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tion in Europe. In turn, Sin­ga­pore is the UK’s largest trade and in­vest­ment part­ner in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The UK-Sin­ga­pore FTA was inked on Dec 10 by Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try Chan Chun Sing and UK Sec­re­tary of State for In­ter­na­tional Trade El­iz­a­beth Truss.</p>
    <p>MTI said the UK-Sin­ga­pore FTA pro­vides cer­tainty and clar­ity in trad­ing ar­range­ments be­tween both coun­tries. “Com­pa­nies will be able to en­joy the same EU-Sin­ga­pore FTA ben­e­fits when trad­ing be­tween the UK and Sin­ga­pore un­der the UK-Sin­ga­pore FTA,” MTI said.</p>
    <p>These in­clude tar­iff elim­i­na­tion for goods trade, in­creased ac­cess to ser­vices and gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment mar­kets, as well as re­duc­tion of non-tar­iff bar­ri­ers.</p>
    <p>In terms of tar­iffs, the UK-Sin­ga­pore FTA will main­tain the same time­line for tar­iff re­duc­tions as the EU-Sin­ga­pore FTA. This means that 84 per cent of Sin­ga­pore ex­ports en­ter­ing Bri­tain will con­tinue to be duty-free once the agree­ment en­ters into force. By Nov 21, 2024, tar­iffs on vir­tu­ally all re­main­ing prod­ucts will be elim­i­nated.</p>
    <p>Lib­eral and flex­i­ble rules of ori­gin for Bri­tain and Sin­ga­pore’s key ex­ports to each other’s mar­kets, such as cars, chem­i­cals, elec­tron­ics and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, will con­tinue to be pro­vided for. Sin­ga­pore firms will con­tinue to en­joy en­hanced mar­ket ac­cess in the UK for Asian food prod­ucts made in Sin­ga­pore such as har gow (prawn dumplings) and sam­bal ikan bilis (spicy crispy an­chovies). These goods will en­ter the UK tar­iff-free un­der flex­i­ble rules of ori­gin, up to a com­bined quota of 350 tonnes an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>Ser­vice providers, pro­fes­sion­als and in­vestors will have en­hanced mar­ket ac­cess, cre­at­ing a level play­ing field for busi­nesses in both Bri­tain and Sin­ga­pore. This in­cludes sec­tor-spe­cific rules on nondis­crim­i­na­tion and trans­parency.</p>
    <p>A wide range of ser­vices is cov­ered un­der the deal, in­clud­ing ar­chi­tec­ture and en­gi­neer­ing, as well as ho­tel and res­tau­rant ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The UK will grant Sin­ga­pore en­hanced ac­cess to city-level and mu­nic­i­pal-level gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties, which means that firms here can bid for more gov­ern­ment projects in Bri­tain. Com­pa­nies that are ex­pected to ben­e­fit in­clude those in trans­port, fi­nan­cial ser­vices and util­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The deal will also do away with un­nec­es­sary tech­ni­cal bar­ri­ers to trade for Sin­ga­pore and UK ex­porters. For ex­am­ple, it will re­duce du­plica­tive test­ing, low­er­ing costs for ex­porters. Sec­tors that will ben­e­fit in­clude elec­tron­ics and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals.</p>
    <p>The FTA also al­lows Sin­ga­pore and Bri­tain to con­tinue en­joy­ing a com­pre­hen­sive In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Rights Chap­ter which cov­ers copyright, en­force­ment and ge­o­graph­i­cal in­di­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Beyond the agree­ment, Sin­ga­pore and the UK have com­mit­ted to start ne­go­ti­a­tions for a high stan­dard in­vest­ment pro­tec­tion agree­ment within two years of the FTA com­ing into force, and aim to con­clude the talks within four years.</p>
    <p>MTI said: “This will en­sure that our bi­lat­eral in­vest­ments will be cov­ered by ro­bust and up-to-date treaty pro­tec­tions, and pro­vide our busi­nesses and in­vestors with the cer­tainty of in­vest­ment pro­tec­tion.”</p>
