    <p>Stricter mea­sures are in place for Hindu devo­tees par­tic­i­pat­ing in the Thai­pusam fes­ti­val next month due to the Covid-19 pan­demic. For in­stance, devo­tees must pre-book time slots and kavadis are not al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Hindu devo­tees who wish to par­tic­i­pate in the Thai­pusam fes­ti­val next month will have to abide by a host of strin­gent mea­sures, in­clud­ing pre-book­ing time slots to en­ter the tem­ple and us­ing only pre-pre­pared of­fer­ings.</p>
    <p>Un­like pre­vi­ous years, there will be no foot pro­ces­sion from the Sri Srini­vasa Peru­mal Tem­ple in Seran­goon Road to Sri Then­dayutha­pani Tem­ple in Tank Road dur­ing the fes­ti­val on Jan 28, and ac­tiv­i­ties will be con­ducted only in and around the lat­ter tem­ple, it was an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The two temples and the Hindu En­dow­ments Board said in a joint state­ment that these re­stric­tions are nec­es­sary in the light of the Covid-19 pan­demic, and the de­ci­sion to con­tinue hold­ing the fes­ti­val was taken be­cause of its his­tor­i­cal sig­nif­i­cance.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the fes­ti­val, devo­tees typ­i­cally ful­fil their vows and carry paal ku­dams or milk pots, or kavadis, which are wooden or metal struc­tures with milk of­fer­ings, into the Tank Road tem­ple.</p>
    <p>To pre­vent any po­ten­tial out­breaks of Covid-19, the or­gan­is­ers will ban all forms of kavadis for the up­com­ing fes­ti­val.</p>
    <p>It is “im­pos­si­ble to main­tain safe dis­tanc­ing” as a team is re­quired to as­sem­ble and mount the kavadi on the car­rier, said the or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>Kavadis that pierce the body – in­clud­ing the tongue, cheeks, arms or legs – in­volve too close a con­tact be­tween in­di­vid­u­als and go against safe dis­tanc­ing rec­om­men­da­tions, said the or­gan­is­ers.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, devo­tees who wish to carry paal ku­dams into the tem­ple can use only pots that are prepre­pared by the tem­ple. But the num­ber of paal ku­dams avail­able will be capped, and each devo­tee bear­ing a paal ku­dam can be ac­com­pa­nied by only one per­son.</p>
    <p>The Sri Then­dayutha­pani Tem­ple will also deny entry to devo­tees who have not pre-booked time slots and groups car­ry­ing mu­si­cal in­stru­ments or any form of am­pli­fi­ca­tion de­vice.</p>
    <p>Devo­tees will not be al­lowed to gather out­side the tem­ple and must fol­low a path­way as­signed by the tem­ple after they fin­ish giv­ing their of­fer­ings and prayers.</p>
    <p>“All of the above mea­sures are car­ried out for the safety and well­be­ing of the devo­tees and their fam­i­lies,” said the state­ment, adding that the or­gan­is­ers in­tend to ac­com­mo­date as many devo­tees as pos­si­ble with­out breach­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The el­derly, the young and those who are phys­i­cally chal­lenged are en­cour­aged to pray at home in­stead via a live stream of the Thai­pusam prayer ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr A. Sun­dera­son, 32, said he would still head down to the tem­ple on Thai­pusam to pray and give of­fer­ings, as he be­lieves the mea­sures would help keep devo­tees safe.</p>
    <p>“I think things will be a lot safer (with these mea­sures), and I think peo­ple will man­age to get their basic duty of pray­ing done and get some en­joy­ment out of it,” said Mr Sun­dera­son, who runs a land­scap­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>But some are dis­ap­pointed that the fes­ti­val will be a much muted af­fair, with­out mu­sic and the usual crowd.</p>
    <p>Mr Navind Ku­mar, 30, said he would pre­fer to cel­e­brate the fes­ti­val at home, given that the at­mos­phere at the tem­ple would be vastly dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>“Maybe the Gov­ern­ment can con­sider al­low­ing big­ger groups to gather so that more of us can cel­e­brate the fes­ti­val to­gether,” said Mr Navind, who owns a clean­ing firm.</p>
    <p>Devo­tees can make their on­line book­ings on the Sri Then­dayutha­pani web­site from Jan 3. More details will be pro­vided closer to the event date.</p>

To pre&#xAD;vent po&#xAD;ten&#xAD;tial out&#xAD;breaks of Covid-19, all forms of kavadis will be banned for the up&#xAD;com&#xAD;ing fes&#xAD;ti&#xAD;val.</p>
