        C12 | THURSDAY, JULY 16 , 2020 Essentials for easy living and working Vehiclemai­ntenanceti­psforPhase­2 By ARUL JOHN The good news for car, van and motorcycle owners is that workshops offering car grooming services will be open in Phase 2. So do give your preferred workshop a call to check if they have resumed services.
Vehicle owners should take note of the following tips with regard to their vehicles.
• If car grooming workshops are still not open, you may choose to purchase car-grooming products and D.I.Y., but you must apply safe distancing rules.
• You can also wash your vehicle on your own but you have to wear a mask while doing so as it is not considered a strenuous activity. If someone else is coming along with you, you need to ensure a safe distance of 2m. More good news is that ERP operations will cease until July 26, so it will be cheaper to drive to visit your relatives now.
• Physical car sales will resume and COE bidding will resume on July 6, so you can start checking out the ;latest car models at the showrooms now! Alternativ­ely, you may still purchase your vehicles online too.
If your vehicle inspection is due between April 7 and June 30, LTA will defer periodic inspection­s for private cars by 6 months. LTA had also announced that the road tax for these private cars to be renewed for six months if they have valid insurance coverage. • All other vehicles, such as goods vehicles, buses, taxis, private-hire cars and motorcycle­s, are still required to go for periodic inspection­s and the authorised Inspection Centres will remain open for these inspection­s.
If your car insurance is expiring during this period, check with your insurance provider on how to renew the insurance. If you prefer not to drive your own vehicle during Phase 2, check with your insurance provider about suspending insurance payments for the duration that the vehicle is not used. • • PHOTO: GettyimaPg­HesOTO: Gettyimage­s BLDC HVLS CEILING FANS GET EQUIPPED!
