    <p>Mak­ing East Coast greener and set­ting up sup­port groups for res­i­dents were among the ideas mooted at the first East Coast Con­ver­sa­tion, which took place on­line yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>More than 100 res­i­dents in the con­stituency took part, along with Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat and the GRC’s four other MPs.</p>
    <p>The monthly con­ver­sa­tions, mod­elled af­ter the Our Sin­ga­pore Con­ver­sa­tion se­ries, were first an­nounced in July dur­ing the gen­eral elec­tion cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The plat­form is meant to give East Coast res­i­dents a space to dis­cuss the is­sues that mat­ter to them and work to­gether to put their ideas into ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing yes­ter­day’s dis­cus­sion, res­i­dents ex­plored how neigh­bours could look out for one another. Form­ing sup­port groups for care­givers to share their com­mon chal­lenges was sug­gested.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers pro­posed set­ting up art in­stal­la­tions in neigh­bour­hoods to make them more vi­brant, and draw­ing up a sched­ule of events in which res­i­dents could par­tic­i­pate.</p>
    <p>To make East Coast greener, some sug­gested re­cruit­ing a crew of “green am­bas­sadors” to help raise aware­ness of en­vi­ron­men­tal is­sues.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post last night, Mr Heng wrote that the ses­sion was in­sight­ful, with sev­eral use­ful and cre­ative sug­ges­tions on how res­i­dents can take ac­tion and make a dif­fer­ence in sim­ple ways.</p>
    <p>“Col­lec­tively, these con­ver­sa­tions will en­able res­i­dents to come to­gether, work­ing with com­mu­nity part­ners to gen­er­ate good ideas and to turn these ideas into ac­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice and for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Tan Kiat How, who is also an MP for the GRC, added that he was heart­ened to see that many res­i­dents wanted to step for­ward to re­alise the ideas dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>“We look for­ward to work­ing with our res­i­dents to make East Coast a spe­cial and ex­tra­or­di­nary home for ev­ery­one,” he said.</p>
    <p>Ms Rianne Goh, who was one of the fa­cil­i­ta­tors for yes­ter­day’s con­ver­sa­tion, said it took some time for res­i­dents to warm up to one another. “But once some­one started shar­ing, the ideas started flow­ing.”</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old added: “Through the dis­cus­sions, we hope that res­i­dents will have a deeper sense that they have a stake in the com­mu­nity and that there are av­enues for them to reach out and con­trib­ute their valu­able time and skills.”</p>
    <p>Mr Heng added that the East Coast Sil­ver Blue­print, which aims to ad­dress se­niors’ phys­i­cal, so­cial, emo­tional and dig­i­tal needs, will be un­veiled next week­end.</p>
    <p>The next con­ver­sa­tion on build­ing a de­men­ti­afriendly com­mu­nity will be held on Oct 24.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing yes­ter­day’s dis­cus­sion, res­i­dents ex­plored how neigh­bours could look out for one another. Form­ing sup­port groups for care­givers to share their com­mon chal­lenges was sug­gested. Oth­ers pro­posed set­ting up art in­stal­la­tions in neigh­bour­hoods to make them more vi­brant, and draw­ing up a sched­ule of events in which res­i­dents could par­tic­i­pate.</p>
