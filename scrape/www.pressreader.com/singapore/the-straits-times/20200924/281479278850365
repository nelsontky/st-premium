    <p>Malaysia’s op­po­si­tion leader An­war Ibrahim said yes­ter­day that he has a “strong, con­vinc­ing, for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity” to form a new government and that Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin’s government has “col­lapsed”.</p>
    <p>He de­clined to give the num­ber of MPs now on his side. A min­i­mum of 112 MPs are needed to con­trol Par­lia­ment in the 222-seat House.</p>
    <p>Prior to this, the three-party Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) coali­tion that he leads has 91 MPs – 38 law­mak­ers from his Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat, 42 from the Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party and 11 from Parti Amanah Ne­gara.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri An­war, 73, told a news con­fer­ence at a ho­tel in Kuala Lumpur that the MPs with him now in­clude those from the rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional (PN) al­liance.</p>
    <p>“We have a strong, con­vinc­ing, for­mi­da­ble ma­jor­ity,” Mr An­war told re­porters. “We need a strong stable government to run this coun­try and to save the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>He said the num­ber of MPs on his side would be re­vealed only af­ter his meet­ing with the King, Sul­tan</p>
    <p>Ab­dul­lah Ri’ay­atud­din, to con­firm that he now has par­lia­men­tary ma­jor­ity. The National Palace an­nounced on Tues­day evening that Sul­tan Ab­dul­lah, 61, has been hos­pi­talised with an un­spec­i­fied ail­ment.</p>
    <p>“With a clear and in­dis­putable sup­port and ma­jor­ity be­hind me, the government led by Tan Sri Muhyid­din Yassin has col­lapsed,” added Mr An­war. The shock an­nounce­ment comes seven months af­ter the collapse of the PH government in late Fe­bru­ary. It was led by Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad at the time.</p>
    <p>The spec­u­la­tion yes­ter­day was that Mr An­war’s 91 MPs will be joined by a bloc of MPs from the</p>
    <p>Gabun­gan Parti Sarawak (GPS) coali­tion and an­other group from Umno.</p>
    <p>But a string of lead­ers from GPS, which has 19 MPs, de­nied that they are switch­ing camp. Umno pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi, though, said he was in­formed that some MPs from Umno and his Barisan Na­sional coali­tion had ex­pressed their sup­port for Mr An­war. “I re­spect their stand,” Mr Zahid said.</p>
    <p>Mr An­war said Dr Ma­hathir’s group of five MPs, in­clud­ing the states­man him­self, would not be join­ing his new government.</p>
    <p>It was also not known if an­other group of nine MPs from Sabah, who have aligned them­selves with</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir, will throw in their lot with Mr An­war.</p>
    <p>When Par­lia­ment sat on July 13, PN had 113 law­mak­ers on its side.</p>
    <p>PH had sup­port from 109 MPs, in­clud­ing its al­lies in Sabah.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din fought back yes­ter­day, say­ing in a state­ment that he is still Malaysia’s le­git­i­mate leader and that his PN government re­mains in power un­til Mr An­war has proven through con­sti­tu­tional means his claim of ma­jor­ity sup­port from the fed­eral law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>“I take note of Datuk Seri An­war Ibrahim’s state­ment claim­ing he has ma­jor­ity sup­port from Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment to form the government. The claim must be proven through the process and meth­ods de­ter­mined by the Fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion,” Mr Muhyid­din said.</p>
    <p>“With­out this process, the state­ment by Datuk Seri An­war is only a claim. Un­til proven oth­er­wise, the Perikatan Na­sional government is still in­tact and I am the le­git­i­mate prime min­is­ter,” he added.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, the 12 po­lit­i­cal par­ties that back the PN ad­min­is­tra­tion said the government has re­mained in­tact and re­jected the claim that some law­mak­ers had jumped par­ties to sup­port Mr An­war.</p>
