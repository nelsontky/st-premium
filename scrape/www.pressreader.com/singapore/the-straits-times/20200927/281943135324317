    <p>MUM­BAI • In­dian po­lice hauled in Bol­ly­wood megas­tar Deepika Padukone for ques­tion­ing yes­ter­day in an es­ca­lat­ing drug in­ves­ti­ga­tion fol­low­ing the death of ac­tor Sushant Singh Ra­jput.</p>
    <p>Ra­jput, 34, was found dead in his apart­ment in June. This sparked a me­dia frenzy which saw rolling news chan­nels spec­u­lat­ing that his for­mer girl­friend, ac­tress Rhea Chakrabort­y drove him to kill him­self with nar­cotics and even black magic.</p>
    <p>Ra­jput’s fam­ily dis­puted re­ports that he suf­fered from de­pres­sion and openly ac­cused Chakrabort­y, 28, of steal­ing his money and ha­rass­ing him.</p>
    <p>The ac­tress, who de­nies any wrong­do­ing and who has been hounded for months by the me­dia to­gether with her fam­ily, was ar­rested this month over claims that she bought cannabis for Ra­jput. She was de­nied bail last week.</p>
    <p>The saga has now mor­phed into a probe by the au­thor­i­ties into drug­tak­ing within the multi-bil­lion-dol­lar film in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The 34-year-old Padukone, who is one of Bol­ly­wood’s big­gest stars, was sum­moned ear­lier last week for ques­tion­ing by the Nar­cotics Con­trol Bureau (NCB) in Mum­bai, as were ac­tresses Sara Ali Khan, Shrad­dha Kapoor and Rakul Preet Singh.</p>
    <p>Singh’s state­ment was recorded on Friday. Kapoor and Khan were also ex­pected to ap­pear be­fore the NCB yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in the week, tele­vi­sion chan­nel Times Now broad­cast sec­tions of a What­sApp con­ver­sa­tion about procur­ing hash, al­leg­ing that the two peo­ple chat­ting were Padukone and her man­ager.</p>
    <p>Direc­tor Karan Jo­har, who has also been a tar­get of tele­vi­sion chan­nels and so­cial me­dia users since the death of Ra­jput, re­leased a state­ment on Friday re­ject­ing claims that drugs were con­sumed at a party that he hosted at his home last year.</p>
