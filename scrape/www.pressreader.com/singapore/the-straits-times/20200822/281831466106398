    <p>• The health au­thor­i­ties in China’s cap­i­tal Bei­jing have re­moved a re­quire­ment for peo­ple to wear masks out­doors, fur­ther re­lax­ing rules aimed at pre­vent­ing the spread of the coro­n­avirus, af­ter the city re­ported 13 con­sec­u­tive days with­out new cases.</p>
    <p>De­spite the re­laxed guide­lines, a large pro­por­tion of peo­ple con­tin­ued to wear masks in Bei­jing yes­ter­day. Some said the masks made them feel safer, while oth­ers said so­cial pres­sures to wear masks were also a fac­tor.</p>
    <p>“I think I can take off my mask any­time, but I’ll need to see if oth­ers ac­cept it. Be­cause I’m afraid that peo­ple would be scared if they see me not wear­ing a mask,” one 24-year-old Bei­jing woman sur­named Cao said.</p>
    <p>It is the sec­ond time Bei­jing’s health au­thor­i­ties have re­laxed guide­lines on mask wear­ing in the cap­i­tal, which has largely re­turned to nor­mal af­ter two rounds of tar­geted lock­downs.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s mu­nic­i­pal Cen­tres for Dis­ease Con­trol first said res­i­dents could go with­out masks in out­door ar­eas in late April, but the rules were re­versed in June af­ter a new out­break in the mas­sive Xin­fadi whole­sale mar­ket in the city’s south.</p>
    <p>Xin­fadi re­opened last Satur­day, af­ter its busi­ness was sus­pended on June 13. The mar­ket will, how­ever, cease its re­tail busi­ness and close its doors to in­di­vid­ual con­sumers, and all sellers and buy­ers are re­quired to com­plete real-name au­then­ti­ca­tion be­fore en­ter­ing.</p>
    <p>Since June 11, Bei­jing has re­ported 335 cases linked to the Xin­fadi clus</p>
    <p>CAN OTH­ERS AC­CEPT IT?</p>
    <p>I think I can take off my mask any­time, but I’ll need to see if oth­ers ac­cept it. Be­cause I’m afraid that peo­ple would be scared if they see me not wear­ing a mask. ’’</p>
    <p>MS CAO, a 24-year-old woman, af­ter Bei­jing lifted a rule on wear­ing masks out­doors.</p>
    <p>ter. By Aug 6, all of the pa­tients had been dis­charged af­ter re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>China has re­ported no new lo­cally trans­mit­ted cases on the main­land for five days af­ter suc­cess­fully con­trol­ling flare-ups in Bei­jing, the Xin­jiang re­gion and else­where.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts say the key to the coun­try’s suc­cess in con­trol­ling the dis­ease has been the strict en­force­ment of lo­cal rules, in­clud­ing wear­ing masks, manda­tory home quar­an­tine and par­tic­i­pat­ing in mass testing.</p>
    <p>The National Health Com­mis­sion said yes­ter­day that there were 22 im­ported cases on the main­land on Thurs­day. The coun­try has re­ported a to­tal of 84,917 cases since the out­break be­gan late last year, and a death toll of 4,634.</p>
