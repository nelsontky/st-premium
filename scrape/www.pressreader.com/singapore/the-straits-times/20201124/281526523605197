    <p>Un­de­terred by the high price tag, home seek­ers rushed for the five-room Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flats in Toa Payoh (Bi­dadari) – the most ex­pen­sive units in this month’s sales launch. As at 5pm yes­ter­day, each of the 144 five-room flats in Bart­ley Bea­con had more than six first-time ap­pli­cants vy­ing for the unit.</p>
    <p>Un­de­terred by the high price tag, home seek­ers rushed for the five­room Build-To-Or­der (BTO) flats in Toa Payoh (Bi­dadari) – the most ex­pen­sive units in this month’s sales launch.</p>
    <p>As at 5pm yes­ter­day, each of the 144 five-room flats in Bart­ley Bea­con had more than six first-time ap­pli­cants vy­ing for the unit.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-time ap­pli­cants face an even bleaker prospect, with more than 152 ap­pli­cants vy­ing for each five-roomer.</p>
    <p>Prices for these flats – the largest flat types in the Bi­dadari es­tate project – range from $627,000 to $726,000, ex­clud­ing grants.</p>
    <p>The last time new BTO flats were launched in Bi­dadari es­tate, which is clas­si­fied un­der Toa Payoh town, was in May 2017.</p>
    <p>Then, prices for the five-room flats in a project named Woodleigh Hill­side started from $579,000, ex­clud­ing grants.</p>
    <p>In this month’s sales ex­er­cise, which con­cluded at mid­night, the 910 four-room flats in Bart­ley Bea­con and ParkView @ Bi­dadari were less pop­u­lar, at­tract­ing around three first-time ap­pli­cants for each unit.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, first-time ap­pli­cants for the 184 three-room flats in both projects stood a bet­ter chance at se­cur­ing a flat as they at­tracted just slightly more ap­pli­cants than the num­ber of avail­able units.</p>
    <p>Also in de­mand were the four­room flats in Bis­han Ridges, with close to five first-time ap­pli­cants vy­ing for each of the 1,222 flats.</p>
    <p>These flats, within walk­ing dis­tance of Bis­han MRT sta­tion, were the sec­ond most ex­pen­sive units in this launch, with prices rang­ing from $528,000 to $679,000.</p>
    <p>The 124 three-room flats in Bis­han Ridges drew less in­ter­est at slightly fewer than three first-time ap­pli­cants for each unit.</p>
    <p>In Tampines, there were around three first-time ap­pli­cants for each of the 360 four-room and 244 five­room flats in a hous­ing project named Tampines GreenEmer­ald.</p>
    <p>Big­ger flats in the non-ma­ture es­tate of Sem­bawang were also hotly con­tested, with more than four first-time ap­pli­cants vy­ing for each of the 184 five-room flats in the Sun Sails project.</p>
    <p>The odds were slightly bet­ter for the 238 four-room flats and 84 three-room flats, with around three first-time ap­pli­cants for each avail­able unit.</p>
    <p>In Ten­gah, the first Hous­ing Board new town in over 20 years, there were al­most three first-time ap­pli­cants for each of the 327 five­room flats and around two ap­pli­cants for each of the 570 four­room flats.</p>
    <p>These flats are spread across two hous­ing projects named Gar­den Court @ Ten­gah and Gar­den Ter­race @ Ten­gah, and will be the first to be com­pleted around the first quar­ter of 2024.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary next year, the HDB will launch some 3,500 BTO flats in Bukit Ba­tok, Ten­gah, Kal­lang/Wham­poa and Toa Payoh (Bi­dadari).</p>
    <p>An­other 3,800 BTO flats will be of­fered in Bukit Merah, Gey­lang, Ten­gah and Wood­lands next May.</p>
