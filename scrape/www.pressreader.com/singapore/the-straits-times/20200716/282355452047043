    <p>DUBAI • Saudi Ara­bia’s Gen­eral Author­ity for Com­pe­ti­tion (GAC) has can­celled the li­cence of Qatari broad­caster beIN Sports, which has been barred from broad­cast­ing in the king­dom since mid-2017 due to a diplo­matic dis­pute be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>GAC said on Tues­day it was also fin­ing beIN Sports 10 mil­lion riyals (S$3.7 mil­lion) for “mo­nop­o­lis­tic prac­tices”, a charge the broad­caster de­nied.</p>
    <p>BeIN holds re­gional broad­cast­ing rights for sev­eral ma­jor global sport­ing events, i nclud­ing the English Pre­mier League.</p>
    <p>The broad­caster was ini­tially blocked in Saudi un­der a boy­cott im­posed when Riyadh and its al­lies sev­ered diplo­matic and trade ties with Qatar i n 2017 over Doha’s al­leged sup­port of ter­ror­ism, a charge Qatar de­nies.</p>
    <p>GAC said it found beIN Sports had “abused its dom­i­nant po­si­tion through sev­eral mo­nop­o­lis­tic prac­tices” re­lated to what it de­scribed as an ex­clu­sive sports broad­cast bun­dle for Euro 2016.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, BeIN dis­missed the de­ci­sion as “non­sen­si­cal”. It said: “The idea that per­ma­nently ban­ning a l ead­ing com­peti­tor from a mar­ket could in any way pro­mote com­pe­ti­tion is... ab­surd.”</p>
    <p>In 2018, Qatar filed a com­plaint with the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO), say­ing Saudi Ara­bia was block­ing beIN from broad­cast­ing in the king­dom and said it had re­fused to take ef­fec­tive ac­tion against al­leged piracy of beIN’s con­tent by be­outQ, a com­mer­cialscale pi­rat­ing op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>A WTO panel last month found Saudi Ara­bia had breached global rules on in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty rights by fail­ing to pros­e­cute be­outQ, while sup­port­ing Riyadh’s view that it could block the Qatari broad­caster from ob­tain­ing le­gal coun­sel in the king­dom on grounds of na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Be­outQ is widely avail­able in Saudi Ara­bia but Riyadh in­sists it is not based there, and that the gov­ern­ment is com­mit­ted to pro­tect­ing IP rights.</p>
    <p>The Saudi sov­er­eign wealth fund is seek­ing to buy Pre­mier League club New­cas­tle United but the WTO rul­ing could have se­ri­ous im­pli­ca­tions for its pro­posed £300 mil­lion (S$525.2 mil­lion) takeover.</p>
    <p>Pre­mier League foot­ball chief ex­ec­u­tive Richard Mas­ters ad­mit­ted last month that the deal was “com­pli­cated” and with this lat­est move, there is now also no le­gal way for any­one in Saudi Ara­bia to watch Eng­land’s top tier.</p>
