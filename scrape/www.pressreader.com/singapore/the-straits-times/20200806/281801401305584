    <p>JERUSALEM • Is­rael on Tues­day of­fered hu­man­i­tar­ian aid to Le­banon, with which it is still tech­ni­cally at war, fol­low­ing the huge ex­plo­sions that rocked Beirut, killing dozens of peo­ple and wound­ing thou­sands.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Ben­jamin Ne­tanyahu said he had in­structed his Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil to make con­tact with United Na­tions Mid­dle East en­voy Nick­o­lay Mlade­nov “in or­der to clar­ify how Is­rael can fur­ther as­sist Le­banon”.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, De­fence Min­is­ter Benny Gantz and For­eign Min­is­ter Gabi Ashkenazi said Is­rael had “of­fered the Le­banese gov­ern­ment – via in­ter­na­tional in­ter­me­di­aries – med­i­cal and hu­man­i­tar­ian aid, as well as im­me­di­ate emer­gency as­sis­tance”.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Reu­ven Rivlin said: “We share the pain of the Le­banese peo­ple and sin­cerely reach out to of­fer our aid at this dif­fi­cult time.”</p>
    <p>The of­fers come af­ter two weeks of height­ened ten­sions be­tween the ri­val neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Last week, Is­rael ac­cused the Le­banese group Hizbol­lah of try­ing to send gun­men across the UN-de­mar­cated “Blue Line” bor­der and said it held the Beirut gov­ern­ment re­spon­si­ble for what it termed an at­tempted “ter­ror­ist” at­tack.</p>
    <p>Hizbol­lah and Is­rael last fought a 33-day war in the sum­mer of 2006.</p>
    <p>Close al­lies and tra­di­tional ad­ver­saries of Le­banon paid trib­ute on Tues­day to the vic­tims of the twin blasts, as con­do­lences and of­fers of help poured in.</p>
    <p>Le­banon’s Prime Min­is­ter Has­san Diab called on “friendly coun­tries” to sup­port the coun­try al­ready reel­ing from its worst eco­nomic cri­sis in decades as well as the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Gulf na­tions were among the first to re­act, with Qatar promis­ing to send field hos­pi­tals to sup­port the med­i­cal re­sponse. Qatar’s ruler, Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Ha­mad AlThani, wished “a speedy re­cov­ery for the in­jured”, while the United Arab Emi­rates’ Vice-Pres­i­dent and ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mo­hammed bin Rashid Al-Mak­toum, tweeted “our con­do­lences to our beloved peo­ple in Le­banon”.</p>
    <p>Kuwait said it would also send emer­gency aid. Egypt ex­pressed “deep con­cern” at the de­struc­tion, and Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit of­fered con­do­lences, stress­ing “the im­por­tance of find­ing the truth about the ex­plo­sions”.</p>
    <p>Jor­dan’s For­eign Min­is­ter Ay­man Safadi said Am­man was ready to pro­vide any help Le­banon needed, while Iran said it was “fully pre­pared to ren­der as­sis­tance in any way nec­es­sary”.</p>
    <p>“Our thoughts and prayers are with the great and re­silient peo­ple of Le­banon,” Ira­nian For­eign Min­is­ter Mo­ham­mad Javad Zarif tweeted. “Stay strong, Le­banon.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin said: “Rus­sia shares the grief of the Le­banese peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton said it too would help.</p>
