    <p>Sev­eral sports teams in Sin­ga­pore have been in­cur­ring more costs dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic as they have to book ad­di­tional fa­cil­i­ties be­cause only five play­ers are al­lowed on one court at any one time. For the Swifts Bar­racu­das, ex­penses have dou­bled as the Net­ball Su­per League club has to book an ad­di­tional court for 20 play­ers to train twice a week at the Kal­lang Net­ball Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>GENEVA • Lionel Messi and Cris­tiano Ron­aldo will come up against each other in this sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League af­ter Barcelona and Ju­ven­tus were placed in the same group in yes­ter­day’s draw.</p>
    <p>The two for­mer win­ners were drawn in Group G along with Dy­namo Kiev of Ukraine and Hun­gar­ian side Ferenc­varos.</p>
    <p>Messi and Ron­aldo will re­sume the ri­valry they de­vel­oped when the Por­tuguese su­per­star was at Real Madrid. Be­tween them they have won 11 of the last 12 Bal­lon d’Or awards.</p>
    <p>How­ever, t he duo have not clashed in the early stage of the Cham­pi­ons League.</p>
    <p>They met in the 2009 fi­nal, when Messi’s Barcelona beat Ron­aldo and Manch­ester United 2-0.</p>
    <p>Beaten 2020 fi­nal­ists Paris Saint-Ger­main will have a chance for re­venge against United, who ousted the French club in the last 16 two sea­sons ago.</p>
    <p>PSG will also come up against RB Leipzig and Is­tan­bul Basak­se­hir in Group H.</p>
    <p>PSG and Leipzig met in last sea­son’s semi-fi­nals in Lis­bon in Au­gust, with PSG win­ning 3-0 be­fore los­ing to Bay­ern Mu­nich in their first-ever fi­nal ap­pear­ance.</p>
    <p>Hold­ers Bay­ern will face Atletico Madrid and a short trip across the bor­der to Aus­tria to take on Salzburg in Group A. Loko­mo­tiv Moscow com­plete the group.</p>
    <p>English Premier League cham­pi­ons Liver­pool, who won the Cham­pi­ons League in 2019, will face Ajax as well as Ata­lanta and Midtjyl­land in Group D.</p>
    <p>Manch­ester City are in Group C with Por­tuguese cham­pi­ons Porto, Olympiakos and Mar­seille.</p>
    <p>Chelsea will meet Europa League cham­pi­ons Sevilla in Group E, along­side Krasnodar and Rennes.</p>
    <p>The group stage starts on Oct 20, and all six rounds of games will be crammed into eight weeks in a sched­ule that is even more packed than usual be­cause of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the draw yes­ter­day, for­mer Chelsea striker Di­dier Drogba was pre­sented with the Uefa Pres­i­dent’s Award.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern’s Manuel Neuer was named men’s Goal­keeper of the Year and Sarah Bouhaddi of Lyon claimed the women’s hon­our.</p>
    <p>Lyon’s Wendie Re­nard was the women’s De­fender of the Year with team­mate Dzsenifer Marozsan the best mid­fielder, while Bay­ern’s Joshua Kim­mich was the No. 1 men’s de­fender and Manch­ester City’s Kevin De Bruyne named best mid­fielder.</p>
    <p>Bay­ern’s Robert Lewandowsk­i won awards for the best men’s for­ward and over­all best player, while new Chelsea sign­ing Pernille Harder was named the best women’s for­ward.</p>
