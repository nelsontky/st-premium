    <p>US tech­nol­ogy firms, in­clud­ing Ama­zon, Ap­ple, Face­book and Google, face fines of up to 10 per cent of their an­nual turnover and could even be forced to break up un­der draft Euro­pean Union rules aimed at curb­ing their pow­ers. Reg­u­la­tory scru­tiny of tech gi­ants and their power has been grow­ing fol­low­ing a string of scan­dals.</p>
    <p>BRUS­SELS • US tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies in­clud­ing Ama­zon, Ap­ple, Face­book and Google face fines of up to 10 per cent of their an­nual turnover and could even be forced to break up un­der draft EU rules aimed at curb­ing their pow­ers.</p>
    <p>The rules un­veiled on Tues­day are the most se­ri­ous at­tempt by the 27-coun­try bloc to tame tech com­pa­nies that con­trol troves of data and on­line plat­forms re­lied on by thou­sands of com­pa­nies and mil­lions of Euro­peans for their work and so­cial in­ter­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>They also mark the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion’s frus­tra­tion with its anti-trust cases against the tech gi­ants, no­tably Al­pha­bet’s Google, which crit­ics say did not ad­dress the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tory scru­tiny of tech gi­ants and their power has been grow­ing world­wide, fol­low­ing a string of scan­dals over pri­vacy and mis­in­for­ma­tion. Euro­pean Com­pe­ti­tion com­mis­sioner Mar­grethe Vestager and EU In­ter­nal Mar­ket com­mis­sioner Thierry Bre­ton both see the rules as a bid to pre­vent the emer­gence of anti-com­pet­i­tive dom­i­nant com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>One set of reg­u­la­tions, the Dig­i­tal Mar­kets Act (DMA), calls for fines up to 10 per cent of an­nual global turnover for so-called on­line gate­keep­ers that do not com­ply with the new rules as well as a break-up or­der as a last re­sort.</p>
    <p>It also sets out a list of dos and don’ts for gate­keep­ers, de­fined as firms with an en­trenched po­si­tion, a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact on the EU mar­ket and with a core plat­form ser­vice which is an im­por­tant gate­way to users.</p>
    <p>These com­pa­nies will also be re­quired to re­port merger bids to the author­i­ties, a move aimed at pre­vent­ing ac­qui­si­tions that kill off ri­val busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond set of reg­u­la­tions, the Dig­i­tal Ser­vices Act, also tar­gets very large on­line plat­forms, such as those with more than 45 mil­lion users. They will be re­quired to do more to tackle il­le­gal con­tent, mis­uses of their plat­forms that in­fringe fun­da­men­tal rights and in­ten­tional ma­nip­u­la­tion of plat­forms to in­flu­ence elec­tions and pub­lic health, among other re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>The com­pa­nies will also have to show de­tails of po­lit­i­cal ad­ver­tis­ing on their plat­forms and the pa­ram­e­ters used by their al­go­rithms to sug­gest and rank in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>The draft rules need to be ap­proved by EU coun­tries and their law­mak­ers, some of which have pushed for tougher laws, while oth­ers are con­cerned about reg­u­la­tory over-reach and the im­pact on in­no­va­tion. Tech com­pa­nies, which have called for pro­por­tion­ate and balanced laws, are ex­pected to take ad­van­tage of this split to lobby for weaker rules, with the fi­nal draft ex­pected in the com­ing months or even years.</p>
    <p>Dif­fer­ences be­tween the tech gi­ants could di­lute the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Face­book, for one, has urged the EU to rein in Ap­ple. “We hope the DMA will also set bound­aries for Ap­ple. Ap­ple con­trols an en­tire ecosys­tem from de­vice to app store and apps, and uses this power to harm de­vel­op­ers and con­sumers, as well as large plat­forms like Face­book,” the US so­cial network said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>In an­other devel­op­ment, Aus­tralia’s con­sumer watch­dog yes­ter­day launched le­gal ac­tion against Face­book, al­leg­ing the so­cial me­dia gi­ant “mis­led” thou­sands of Aus­tralians by col­lect­ing user data from a free VPN ser­vice ad­ver­tised as pri­vate.</p>
    <p>The plat­form could face a fine if found guilty of de­ceiv­ing users, as Aus­tralia takes an in­creas­ingly as­sertive stance to­wards pow­er­ful US tech ti­tans. The watch­dog had pre­vi­ously helped draft a law that threat­ens Face­book and Google with mil­lions of dol­lars in fines un­less they agree to pay me­dia out­lets when their plat­forms host news con­tent.</p>
    <p>FACE­BOOK TURNS ON AP­PLE</p>
    <p>We hope the DMA (Dig­i­tal Mar­kets Act) will also set bound­aries for Ap­ple. Ap­ple con­trols an en­tire ecosys­tem from de­vice to app store and apps, and uses this power to harm de­vel­op­ers and con­sumers, as well as large plat­forms like Face­book.</p>
    <p>FACE­BOOK, urg­ing the Euro­pean Union to rein in Ap­ple.</p>
