    <p>MEM­PHIS (Ten­nessee) • Phil Mick­el­son was one over af­ter three holes in the third round of the WGC-St Jude In­vi­ta­tional on Satur­day, but still felt in­spired to send his brother and cad­die a pos­i­tive mes­sage.</p>
    <p>“On the fourth tee I said to Tim, ‘This is so much fun’,” he said. “I’m hav­ing so much fun be­cause I can feel my game turn around.</p>
    <p>“I’m start­ing to play well again. I’m start­ing to putt well and start­ing to drive the ball well... I just think the re­sults are go­ing to start to slowly come back.”</p>
    <p>The re­sults came back rather quickly as Mick­el­son shot a fou­run­der 66 to move up to tied-sixth at seven-un­der 203 over­all, five strokes be­hind leader and fel­low</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can Bren­don Todd (69) head­ing into the fi­nal round in Mem­phis.</p>
    <p>This is the high­est on the leader­board a player aged 50 or over has been af­ter 54 holes of a WGC event since Spain’s Miguel An­gel Jimenez at the 2014 Mex­ico tour­na­ment.</p>
    <p>While he re­mains an out­side bet to win his first PGA Tour tour­na­ment since Fe­bru­ary last year at Peb­ble Beach, the five-time Ma­jor cham­pion feels he is build­ing some mo­men­tum ahead of Thurs­day’s PGA Cham­pi­onship – the year’s first Ma­jor – at TPC Hard­ing Park in San Fran­cisco.</p>
    <p>“I’m go­ing to have to shoot some­thing re­ally low, prob­a­bly 63, 64 to have a re­al­is­tic chance,” the 50-year-old said.</p>
    <p>“It’s cer­tainly out there, I’ve shot it be­fore, but good test of golf.”</p>
    <p>He has just one top-10 fin­ish in 13 Tour starts this sea­son, but TPC South­wind has al­ways of­fered him low-scor­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>He has not fin­ished lower than 12th be­tween 2013 and 2018, when he was se­cond twice and third once.</p>
    <p>And hav­ing made the cut in his three pre­vi­ous events, “Lefty” is hop­ing to gather a head of steam with a sixth Ma­jor in mind.</p>
    <p>“I’ve had a lit­tle bit more con­sis­tency the last few weeks and this has been a good week so far,” he added. “It’s ex­cit­ing that I’m start­ing to play well as we head into them.”</p>
