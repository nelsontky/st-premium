    <p>The days of fac­ing a stern in­ter­viewer in a cold board­room may be over, with com­pa­nies such as in­surer Great Eastern mov­ing to­wards an en­tirely dig­i­tal re­cruit­ment process.</p>
    <p>The firm said it be­gan to dig­i­talise its hir­ing pro­ce­dures as part of an over­all trans­for­ma­tion ef­fort even be­fore the coro­n­avirus pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>It in­tro­duced an end-to-end re­cruit­ment so­lu­tion at the start of the year, which means the en­tire process – from req­ui­si­tion to in­ter­views to even the sign­ing of the job of­fer doc­u­ment – is dig­i­talised.</p>
    <p>Great Eastern is also look­ing to launch a plat­form en­abled by ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, with video in­ter­views, in the fourth quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>The tool will as­sess body lan­guage and ver­bal re­sponses, while of­fer­ing gam­i­fied as­sess­ments.</p>
    <p>This aims to en­hance vir­tual re­cruit­ment in a data-en­abled en­vi­ron­ment, said Mr James Lee, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for group hu­man cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Con­tracts are also signed through dig­i­tal sig­na­tures.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the firm con­tin­ues to reach out to job seek­ers through monthly the­matic ca­reer we­bi­nars, which cater to dif­fer­ent de­mo­graph­ics such as un­der­grad­u­ates, fresh grad­u­ates and mid-ca­reer work­ers look­ing to switch in­dus­tries or jobs.</p>
    <p>Mr Ben Tan, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor for re­gional agency, fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory and ban­cas­sur­ance at Great Eastern, said: “Our seam­less pivot to dig­i­tal, with the use of on­line in­ter­view plat­forms and dig­i­tal forms for hir­ing fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tives due to the pan­demic, has fa­cil­i­tated the re­cruit­ment process in a busi­ness-as-usual way, to sup­port our re­cruit­ment needs.”</p>
    <p>He added that the po­ten­tial fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tives still go through the same strin­gent qual­i­fi­ca­tion process, which in­cludes tak­ing a test by Cap­i­tal Mar­kets and Fi­nan­cial Ad­vi­sory Ser­vices, be­fore they can sell in­sur­ance prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>They are also li­censed through the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore, be­fore sign­ing the con­tract and un­der­go­ing train­ing that cov­ers ad­viser, prod­uct and sys­tem skills and knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>The firm has been hir­ing for both cor­po­rate per­ma­nent po­si­tions and around 200 po­si­tions un­der an SGUnited trainee­ship pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>It is also of­fer­ing in­tern­ships for more than 100 stu­dents from in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing.</p>
    <p>The per­ma­nent po­si­tions span di­vi­sions such as IT in­fra­struc­ture and se­cu­rity, dig­i­tal-re­lated roles such as UI/UX de­vel­op­ment and an­a­lyt­ics, risk man­age­ment and busi­ness de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>From J an­uary to last month, Great Eastern hired 217 per­ma­nent staff and 110 peo­ple un­der the SGUnited trainee­ship pro­gramme. It has also taken in more than 500 fi­nan­cial rep­re­sen­ta­tives since April.</p>
