    <p>Sin­ga­pore is un­likely to see a Bud­get sur­plus next Fe­bru­ary, given the on­go­ing eco­nomic crisis, and even a bal­anced Bud­get will be very hard to achieve, said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>In fact, it may take some time for Sin­ga­pore to re­turn to “pru­dence and bal­anced Bud­gets”, he added.</p>
    <p>“You have to spend money on Covid and the econ­omy is down. Just from a coun­ter­cycli­cal point of view, you do not want to have a neg­a­tive fis­cal im­pulse,” PM Lee said yes­ter­day. “You must keep the econ­omy on an even keel and peo­ple as far as pos­si­ble in jobs, or if not in jobs, some help is ren­dered so that they are able to get past this dif­fi­cult pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>He was re­spond­ing to Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Mick­leth­wait, who had asked if the Gov­ern­ment will run a Bud­get deficit for some time, given that Sin­ga­pore has drawn $52 bil­lion from its re­serves to see the coun­try through the crisis.</p>
    <p>“I hope that we will be able to come back to pru­dence and bal­anced Bud­gets, but it may take a while,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>The mindset that Sin­ga­pore­ans have to earn their keep, and that re­serves are not bot­tom­less, has to be deeply in­grained in the pop­u­la­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>“It is not easy be­cause the op­po­si­tion will say, ‘Well, how much do you have? Let me have a look. Why not take a lit­tle bit more? We are not broke yet.’”</p>
    <p>At present, some sec­tors of the econ­omy, such as avi­a­tion, tourism and en­ter­tain­ment, are in sus­pended an­i­ma­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>“It is bet­ter for me to take care of them and keep th­ese sec­tors in sus­pended an­i­ma­tion, than to risk re­viv­ing them be­fore we are ready to deal with the con­se­quences, and then we have another ma­jor Covid out­break.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has to deal with the im­me­di­ate and medium-term pub­lic health and eco­nomic re­quire­ments, he said.</p>
    <p>“But one day this too will pass, and when it does, we must make sure that we can get back to the habit of bal­anc­ing our Bud­gets.”</p>
    <p>Asked about lead­er­ship suc­ces­sion, PM Lee also re­it­er­ated his pledge to see Sin­ga­pore through the pan­demic be­fore step­ping down as prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is in the mid­dle of an ex­is­ten­tial crisis, he said.</p>
    <p>“It is my re­spon­si­bil­ity to see us through this crisis be­fore I hand it over i n good shape i nto good hands,” he said. “I hope that will be be­fore too long.”</p>
