    <p>Q What has been your big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take?</p>
    <p>A My big­gest in­vest­ing mis­take is that I missed out on us­ing quan­ti­ta­tive meth­ods dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis from 2008 to 2009.</p>
    <p>Quan­ti­ta­tive meth­ods re­fer to re­search strate­gies that fo­cus on quan­ti­fy­ing the col­lec­tion and anal­y­sis of data.</p>
    <p>They are formed from a de­duc­tive ap­proach where the em­pha­sis is on the test­ing of the­o­ries, shaped by em­pir­i­cal ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>But I re­lied just on fun­da­men­tal and tech­ni­cal anal­y­sis, so I took un­nec­es­sary losses and did not have a re­silient game plan to see i nvest­ments through the time the mar­ket hit bot­tom in March 2009.</p>
    <p>At that time, that could have reaped dou­ble-digit re­turns, in terms of per­cent­age.</p>
    <p>The les­son learnt is that hav­ing fun­da­men­tal and tech­ni­cal anal­y­sis is not enough to nav­i­gate the tu­mul­tuous stock mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Q And your best in­vest­ment?</p>
    <p>A My best in­vest­ment is the cre­ation of a sys­tem that har­nesses the strengths of fun­da­men­tal anal­y­sis, tech­ni­cal anal­y­sis and quan­ti­ta­tive meth­ods.</p>
    <p>This sys­tem is used for my clients and has man­aged to iden­tify most of the ma­jor peaks and troughs of the mar­ket since 2015.</p>
    <p>In the Covid-19-in­duced crash in March, we were blessed to be able to catch the mar­ket hit­ting the bot­tom.</p>
    <p>This sys­tem came about from the painful les­son I learnt dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, when the com­bi­na­tion of fun­da­men­tal and tech­ni­cal anal­y­sis did not work as well as I had en­vi­sioned.</p>
    <p>A brand new way of ap­proach to the mar­ket was re­quired and the miss­ing piece of the puz­zle was quan­ti­ta­tive meth­ods.</p>
