    <p>Lo­gis­tics ser­vice provider DHL Ex­press (Sin­ga­pore) is the best work­place in Sin­ga­pore this year, as ranked by global in­sti­tute Great Place to Work.</p>
    <p>Tak­ing swift ac­tion to pro­tect work­ers at the start of the coro­n­avirus out­break and con­stantly en­gag­ing em­ploy­ees are two rea­sons why DHL bagged this award, said man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and se­nior vi­cepres­i­dent Christo­pher Ong.</p>
    <p>The firm em­ploys 981 peo­ple here.</p>
    <p>It started an in­ter­nal multi-func­tional task force as early as Jan­uary to deal with the emerg­ing pub­lic health sit­u­a­tion, Mr Ong noted.</p>
    <p>“At the on­set, the task force met daily to dis­cuss cri­sis con­tain­ment mea­sures, poli­cies and ad­vi­sories to be put in place, re­solve op­er­a­tional chal­lenges, man­power is­sues, and make ad­just­ments for lo­cal in­ter­nal reg­u­la­tions as the sit­u­a­tion un­folded.”</p>
    <p>This early ac­tion helped the com­pany to be swift and de­ci­sive in keep­ing its staff safe even as they car­ried out a front-line ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and care packs were pro­vided, while non-front-line staff worked re­motely, in­clud­ing 180 con­tact cen­tre agents.</p>
    <p>DHL con­tin­ued to pay salary in­cre­ments and bonuses, de­spite “daunt­ing” busi­ness per­for­mance in the first quar­ter, Mr Ong said. It also held a vir­tual en­vi­ron­men­tal health and safety aware­ness week to pro­mote health and well-be­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong added that en­gag­ing staff has ben­e­fits for all, in­clud­ing cus­tomers. “At DHL, we take a ‘Peo­ple First’ ap­proach as we have seen that a more en­gaged work­force takes greater dis­cre­tionary ef­fort to do things right the first time, which is im­por­tant in the in­ter­na­tional ex­press de­liv­ery busi­ness that we are in,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This, in turn, trans­lates into great ser­vice qual­ity for our cus­tomers who con­tinue to use us as their provider of choice.”</p>
    <p>DHL will con­tinue to lis­ten to em­ploy­ees and gather feed­back so it can iden­tify ar­eas for im­prove­ment, he said.</p>
