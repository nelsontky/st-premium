    <p>It was nice to see Mem­bers of Par­lia­ment want­ing to get down to serv­ing their con­stituents quickly (MPs get go­ing with Meet-the-Peo­ple Ses­sions on­line, July 14).</p>
    <p>With res­i­dents bring­ing up a wide range of is­sues, it would be ideal for MPs to han­dle those is­sues on a full-time ba­sis if they hope to dis­charge their du­ties ef­fec­tively and in a timely fash­ion.</p>
    <p>They must pay max­i­mum at­ten­tion to their grass­roots. They need to es­ca­late res­i­dents’ woes and con­cerns to our Gov­ern­ment, and re­flect res­i­dents’ sen­ti­ments. This is what res­i­dents and younger vot­ers ex­pect.</p>
    <p>If an MP holds a sep­a­rate full-time job, it would be dif­fi­cult for him to dis­charge his du­ties pas­sion­ately.</p>
    <p>By be­com­ing a full-time MP, he can ded­i­cate him­self to res­i­dents and de­liver what he promised dur­ing cam­paign­ing. MPs must walk the talk.</p>
    <p>Res­i­dents would also be more will­ing to put their faith in a full-time MP.</p>
