    <p>Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte has ex­pressed hope that the Philip­pines “will be back to nor­mal” by De­cem­ber, when he ex­pects a vac­cine against the coro­n­avirus to emerge from China.</p>
    <p>“I prom­ise you, by the grace of God, I hope by De­cem­ber we will be back to nor­mal,” he said dur­ing his reg­u­lar brief­ing aired yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“Let’s just wait for a vac­cine. Let’s wait till De­cem­ber, if we can just be pa­tient... We are not go­ing back to a ‘new nor­mal’. It’s go­ing to be nor­mal again,” he said, as he ex­tended re­stric­tions in Metro Manila un­til the mid­dle of this month.</p>
    <p>The coun­try last month recorded South-east Asia’s big­gest daily jump in Covid-19 deaths and big­gest sin­gle-day in­crease of con­firmed in­fec­tions, over­whelm­ing some cities’ health­care sys­tems.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials con­firmed 3,954 new in­fec­tions on Thurs­day, the coun­try’s largest sin­gle-day in­crease in new coro­n­avirus cases.</p>
    <p>On July 13, they an­nounced 227 deaths, a spike from a daily av­er­age of about 10 in pre­vi­ous days.</p>
    <p>The cap­i­tal re­gion, the prov­inces south of it and cities in the cen­tral Philip­pines have been un­der quar­an­tine re­stric­tions since June.</p>
    <p>Move­ments of the el­derly and chil­dren have been curbed, and the op­er­a­tions of busi­nesses from restau­rants to gyms lim­ited.</p>
    <p>“My plea is to en­dure some more,” said Mr Duterte.</p>
    <p>He said it was good that the Philip­pines had kept good re­la­tions with China, as he ex­pressed hope that China’s top phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and re­search firms would be ready with a vac­cine against the coro­n­avirus be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>The virus, which has in­fected over 17 mil­lion world­wide, killed over 670,000 and up­ended the global econ­omy, first emerged in</p>
    <p>China’s Wuhan prov­ince.</p>
    <p>“That’s what I’ve been re­peat­ing: vac­cine, vac­cine, vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“If there’s no vac­cine, if this per­sists, we will run out of money,” said Mr Duterte.</p>
    <p>Fi­nance Mi n i s t e r Car­los Dominguez said the Philip­pines was ready to buy doses for at least 20 mil­lion peo­ple which it would dis­trib­ute for free.</p>
    <p>State-run fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions were ready to ear­mark some US$400 mil­lion (S$549 mil­lion) for vac­cine pur­chases, he said.</p>
    <p>“This will be over by De­cem­ber… We’re in good shape to over­come this cri­sis,” he said.</p>
    <p>Eight of the nearly two dozen po­ten­tial vac­cines against Covid-19 are from China, the most from any coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Duterte men­tioned China’s Sinopharm and Si­no­vac Biotech as po­ten­tial sources of vac­cines.</p>
    <p>Sinopharm has two vac­cines that it has been se­lec­tively test­ing on small groups of peo­ple. Both have</p>
    <p>GO­ING BACK TO NOR­MAL</p>
    <p>I prom­ise you, by the grace of God, I hope by De­cem­ber we will be back to nor­mal. Let’s just wait for a vac­cine. Let’s wait till De­cem­ber, if we can just be pa­tient... We are not go­ing back to a ‘new nor­mal’. It’s go­ing to be nor­mal again. ’’</p>

    <p>com­pleted phase two tri­als.</p>
    <p>Si­no­vac Biotech is team­ing up with In­sti­tuto Bu­tan­tan in Brazil, where about 600,000 have signed up for phase three tri­als.</p>
    <p>CanSino Bi­o­log­ics, a part­ner of China’s Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army, has pub­lished re­sults that said its vac­cine, tested in a trial of about 500 par­tic­i­pants in China, has pro­duced strong im­mune re­sponses with only mi­nor side ef­fects.</p>
    <p>Sinopharm and Si­no­vac Biotech are cur­rently build­ing fac­to­ries ca­pa­ble of pro­duc­ing 300 mil­lion doses a year.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing an ap­peal from Mr Duterte, China’s For­eign Min­istry as­sured the Philip­pines it would have pri­or­ity ac­cess to China’s vac­cines. “The Philip­pines is a friendly close neigh­bour and we will give pri­or­ity to its needs once we suc­ceed in de­vel­op­ing a vac­cine,” said the min­istry’s spokesman Wang Wen­bin.</p>
