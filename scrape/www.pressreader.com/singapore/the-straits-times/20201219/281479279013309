    <p>Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) will be re­sum­ing daily non-stop flights be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Los An­ge­les, San Fran­cisco, and New York’s JFK In­ter­na­tional from Jan 18.</p>
    <p>Mr Joey Seow, SIA’s re­gional vi­cepres­i­dent for the Amer­i­cas, noted in a state­ment on Thurs­day that there are “promis­ing signs for re­cov­ery in in­ter­na­tional air travel, par­tic­u­larly with the start of the vac­cine in­oc­u­la­tion pro­gramme”.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view on Thurs­day, he said Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s an­nounce­ment of fur­ther eas­ing of travel mea­sures and the World Eco­nomic Fo­rum switch­ing next year to Sin­ga­pore from Davos, Switzer­land, sig­nalled that “Sin­ga­pore is open for busi­ness”.</p>
    <p>“The Govern­ment has taken on the ob­jec­tive of open­ing up Sin­ga­pore,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that Amer­i­cans are al­lowed to tran­sit in Sin­ga­pore, which was ini­tially not the case. This means there are more op­por­tu­ni­ties to go on a flight.</p>
    <p>“Step by step, there are all th­ese signs, there’s a lot more pos­i­tiv­ity,” he said. He also cited the dis­cus­sions Sin­ga­pore’s Govern­ment is hav­ing with Viet­nam on “green lane” travel bub­ble ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>“As more and more of th­ese travel bub­bles and green lanes are be­ing ne­go­ti­ated, busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties will come about. The coun­try be­gins to slowly but safely open up and we see en­cour­ag­ing signs, which are cause for fur­ther op­ti­mism.”</p>
    <p>Be­fore the Covid-19 pan­demic, SIA op­er­ated 57 flights a week be­tween Sin­ga­pore and the US.</p>
    <p>“When Covid-19 hit us in March, we were down to three a week,” Mr Seow said. “We... closed our US net­work and left only a three-times-aweek Los An­ge­les ser­vice.”</p>
    <p>Gone were the busy Sin­ga­poreNew York and Sin­ga­pore-San Fran­cisco routes.</p>
    <p>But this month, SIA be­gan three flights a week to New York; th­ese will be upped to daily next month.</p>
    <p>This week, SIA started fly­ing three times a week into San Fran­cisco. “We used to have (flights) 17 times a week,” Mr Seow said. “Now, (it’s) three times a week; but that will go up to daily.”</p>
    <p>“For LA, we are now at five a week, we will go up to daily in Jan­uary. There are other ser­vices... Seat­tle (and) Hous­ton, th­ese will come back later.”</p>
    <p>All the flights will be non-stop. SIA will op­er­ate Air­bus A350-900 ul­tra-long-range air­craft on routes from JFK and San Fran­cisco, in a two-class con­fig­u­ra­tion with 67 busi­ness class and 94 pre­mium econ­omy seats, the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Three-cabin A350-900 LH air­craft will con­tinue to be op­er­ated from Los An­ge­les, ac­com­mo­dat­ing 42 busi­ness class, 24 pre­mium econ­omy class and 187 econ­omy class pas­sen­gers.</p>
    <p>“All SIA air­craft are equipped with the Hepa air­flow man­age­ment sys­tems elim­i­nat­ing up to 99.97 per­cent of bac­te­ria, viruses and par­tic­u­late mat­ter from cabin air, which is re­placed every two to three min­utes,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>Asked if, with vac­ci­na­tions now start­ing to be ad­min­is­tered, the air­line would re­quire pas­sen­gers to show any kind of cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of vac­ci­na­tion, Mr Seow said it de­pended on rules in dif­fer­ent states.</p>
    <p>“We don’t set the rules, but we will com­mu­ni­cate to cus­tomers what the rules are and make sure that they do not have dif­fi­cul­ties when they ar­rive at the des­ti­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>SIA’s cargo busi­ness op­er­at­ing out of Los An­ge­les and Dal­las-Fort Worth in Texas is do­ing “ex­tremely well”, he said. He added that the boom in e-com­merce with peo­ple stuck at home and mak­ing more pur­chases from online re­tail­ers had also helped.</p>
    <p>“We get a fair bit of e-com­merce traffic… that has been do­ing very well.”</p>
    <p>SIA had also drawn busi­ness from the mar­ket as other car­ri­ers re­duced their pas­sen­ger flights with belly-hold ca­pac­ity. “We have main­tained our cargo fre­quency. Cargo loads into the United States and out have been very strong,” Mr Seow said.</p>
    <p>SIA would also be car­ry­ing vac­cines, he said.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the state­ment, SIA “ex­pects sig­nif­i­cant cargo traffic on each of the ex­panded ser­vices, pri­mar­ily serv­ing time-sen­si­tive, high­value freight sec­tors such as phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, tech­nol­ogy and fresh pro­duce, among oth­ers”.</p>
    <p>CAUSE FOR OP­TI­MISM</p>
    <p>As more and more of th­ese travel bub­bles and green lanes are be­ing ne­go­ti­ated, busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties will come about.</p>
    <p>The coun­try be­gins to slowly but safely open up and we see en­cour­ag­ing signs, which are cause for fur­ther op­ti­mism.</p>
    <p>MR JOEY SEOW, SIA’s re­gional vice-pres­i­dent for the Amer­i­cas.</p>
