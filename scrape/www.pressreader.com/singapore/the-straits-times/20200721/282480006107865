    <p>FICTION</p>
    <p>IF I HAD YOUR FACE</p>
    <p>By Frances Cha Vik­ing/Paperback/288 pages/ $27.82/Avail­able at bit.ly/IfHYFace_Cha</p>
    <p>There is a pop­u­lar meme on Twit­ter – a sign which says “Men” and be­neath it – the words “Omi­nous mu­sic” in clin­i­cal white font.</p>
    <p>That feels like an apt, if ad­mit­tedly sim­plis­tic, meme for au­thor Frances Cha’s de­but novel – the ur­ban fiction tale If I Had Your Face. Cha, who grew up in the United States, Hong Kong and South Korea, is now based in Brook­lyn.</p>
    <p>The story fol­lows five women who live in the same build­ing in Seoul and their strug­gles to make bet­ter lives for them­selves in the glossy, ap­pear­ance-ob­sessed, pa­tri­ar­chal and class-di­vided South Korean so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>They face prob­lems that stem in large part from gen­der in­equal­i­ties and lim­ited so­cial mo­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>All the men, mean­while, are like car­toon char­ac­ters in how twodi­men­sion­ally evil or in­sipid they are.</p>
    <p>The women, though of­ten prickly and un­lik­able, have rich in­ner lives.</p>
    <p>There is Kyuri, who works in a “room sa­lon” where men pay to drink with her; Ara, a mute hair­styl­ist ob­sessed with a K-pop idol; Su­jin, who yearns for plas­tic surgery so she too can work in a room sa­lon; art stu­dent Miho, who is dat­ing a man from a well-to-do fam­ily; and Wonna, an un­hap­pily mar­ried work­ing woman.</p>
    <p>The book takes its ti­tle from Kyuri. At a plas­tic surgery clinic, she spots a dis­graced K-pop girl group mem­ber and thinks: “I would live your life so much bet­ter than you if I had your face.”</p>
    <p>De­spite that procla­ma­tion, the novel makes the point that be­ing beau­ti­ful means very lit­tle when you have nei­ther money nor power.</p>
    <p>Kyuri and Su­jin suf­fer enor­mous pain af­ter ex­ten­sive plas­tic surgery to look con­ven­tion­ally beau­ti­ful, but be­ing de­sir­able does not change their cir­cum­stances sig­nif­i­cantly. They are still ex­ploited and poor.</p>
    <p>Miho, an or­phan, is de­scribed to be nat­u­rally at­trac­tive and still, her rich boyfriend’s mother is con­de­scend­ing and un­ac­cept­ing of her.</p>
    <p>Cha gives the women, who ro­tate as point-of-view char­ac­ters, dis­tinct voices. Switch­ing seam­lessly between voices, Cha makes all of them, in­clud­ing Su­jin who is seen only through the lenses of other char­ac­ters, real and en­gross­ing.</p>
    <p>While the book’s end­ing may seem abrupt ini­tially, it is fit­ting that none of the prob­lems the women face is re­solved.</p>
    <p>There are no vil­lains who re­form and have a change of heart, no one gets a vic­to­ri­ous mo­ment con­fronting the of­ten struc­tural sys­tems that keep the main five char­ac­ters down in the lower ech­e­lons of so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>In­stead, all the end­ing of­fers is the power of fe­male friend­ship. In the brief time spent with th­ese five char­ac­ters, they form a sis­ter­hood, sup­port­ing one an­other in small but sig­nif­i­cant ways.</p>
    <p>If you like this, read: Kim Ji-young, Born 1982 by Cho Nam-joo (Si­mon & Schus­ter, 2020, $22.95, avail­able at bit.ly/Kim_Jiy­oung), about a woman who suf­fers the ef­fects of gen­der in­equal­ity at every turn in her life since birth, when she was born to a mother whose in-laws wanted a grand­son.</p>
