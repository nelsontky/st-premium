    <p>How can va­cated school premises be given a new lease of life?</p>
    <p>Best thing to do is con­vert them into hos­tels for stu­dents and ser­vice in­dus­try for­eign work­ers. Joshua Sel­vaku­mar</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is small. An un­used school area is a waste. De­mol­ish it to build a higher build­ing for bet­ter use, or for bet­ter in­come. That is the right thing to do. John Tang</p>
    <p>Un­less the school build­ing is ar­chi­tec­turally unique, keep­ing it is less im­por­tant than keep­ing the school name and her­itage. The cul­ture and his­tory of a school are very im­por­tant in in­still­ing pride among stu­dents.</p>
    <p>It’s very dis­ap­point­ing that some schools with longer his­tory than in­de­pen­dent Sin­ga­pore were closed down or merged and re­named be­cause of fall­ing en­rol­ment. The Ed­u­ca­tion Min­istry should re­lo­cate these old schools to new es­tates.</p>
    <p>That way, the her­itage of the school can be pre­served. TY Ho</p>
    <p>They can be used for aged or nurs­ing homes in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>To build a new home costs a lot of money; these old re­dun­dant schools could be a saviour. We just need some ren­o­va­tion work. Peter Tan</p>
    <p>Night classes, dance lessons, gym ses­sions? Dar­ren Pachai Is prac­tis­ing safe dis­tanc­ing get­ting more dif­fi­cult? What can be done to ad­dress this?</p>
    <p>Ac­tu­ally it’s very easy, but peo­ple are re­bel­lious, refuse to change for a safer en­vi­ron­ment. Jim Chua</p>
    <p>With bor­ders closed and Sin­ga­pore be­ing a small is­land, it’s no won­der that peo­ple gather at malls, parks, beaches and ko­pi­ti­ams.</p>
    <p>So long as ev­ery­one masks up prop­erly and keeps clean, it should be OK. Klu­ang Views</p>
    <p>If con­ges­tion on trains and buses were an ideal en­vi­ron­ment for trans­mis­sion, we would’ve seen surges in cases al­ready. But that has not been the case. Af­ter two to three weeks of cin­e­mas open­ing, the in­fec­tion rate has not surged ei­ther.</p>
    <p>The same with crowds in malls. But of course, that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t op­ti­mise safety pre­cau­tions when we can. Frank Young</p>
    <p>When phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing is a prob­lem, the next best thing is to not talk, to breathe lightly and to get away as soon as pos­si­ble. Mar­garet Chong</p>
    <p>De­velop a sys­tem or app that shows the con­cen­tra­tion of peo­ple (real time) at var­i­ous lo­ca­tions, malls, beach, parks, etc. Alan Leong</p>
    <p>Sit­u­a­tions that seem to be be­yond our con­trol, such as in buses and trains dur­ing peak hour, we have no choice. We can­not all drive cars, ride mo­tor­cy­cles or take taxis.</p>
    <p>But sit­u­a­tions that we can choose to avoid, we should avoid at all costs, such as crowds in shop­ping cen­tres, eater­ies, cin­e­mas. Ben­jamin Chew</p>
    <p>Just fo­cus on boost­ing your im­mune sys­tem, your body’s de­fence sys­tem against pathogens. Lawrence Lee</p>
