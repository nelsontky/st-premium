    <p>PARIS • World lead­ers con­demned yes­ter­day’s deadly stab­bings in the French city of Nice and ex­pressed sol­i­dar­ity with France.</p>
    <p>Con­dem­na­tion came from the Pope and Euro­pean lead­ers, as well as from Turkey, which is in­volved in a heated diplo­matic spat with Paris over car­toons mock­ing</p>
    <p>Prophet Muham­mad.</p>
    <p>“We strongly con­demn the at­tack com­mit­ted to­day in­side the Notre-Dame church in Nice,” a Turk­ish For­eign Min­istry state­ment said.</p>
    <p>It also ex­pressed sol­i­dar­ity with France, and of­fered con­do­lences to the rel­a­tives of the three peo­ple killed in the at­tack.</p>
    <p>Euro­pean Union lead­ers pledged to con­front “those that seek to in­cite and spread ha­tred”.</p>
    <p>“I con­demn the odi­ous and bru­tal at­tack that has just taken place in Nice, and I am with France with all my heart,” Euro­pean Com­mis­sion Pres­i­dent Ur­sula von der Leyen tweeted.</p>
    <p>“My thoughts are with the vic­tims of this hate­ful act. All of Europe is in sol­i­dar­ity with France. We will re­main united and de­ter­mined in the face of bar­bar­ity and fa­nati­cism.”</p>
    <p>Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel said: “I am deeply shaken by the bru­tal mur­ders in the church in Nice. My thoughts are with the rel­a­tives of those mur­dered and in­jured. Ger­many stands with France at this dif­fi­cult time.”</p>
    <p>Ital­ian Prime Min­is­ter Giuseppe Conte con­demned what he called a “vile at­tack”, and said it “will not shake the com­mon front de­fend­ing the val­ues of free­dom and peace”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Our con­vic­tions are stronger than fa­nati­cism, ha­tred and ter­ror.”</p>
    <p>Span­ish Prime Min­is­ter Pe­dro Sanchez said: “We con­tinue to de­fend free­dom, our demo­cratic val­ues, peace and the se­cu­rity of our cit­i­zens. United against ter­ror and ha­tred.”</p>
    <p>Pope Fran­cis prayed for the vic­tims, as the Vat­i­can said that “ter­ror­ism and vi­o­lence can never be ac­cepted”.</p>
    <p>“To­day’s at­tack has sown death in a place of love and con­so­la­tion. The Pope is aware of the sit­u­a­tion and is close to the mourn­ing Catholic com­mu­nity,” Vat­i­can spokesman Mat­teo Bruni said.</p>
    <p>The pon­tiff urged peo­ple in France to “unite to com­bat evil with good”.</p>
    <p>I con­demn the odi­ous and bru­tal at­tack that has just taken place in Nice, and I am with France with all my heart.</p>
    <p>EURO­PEAN COM­MIS­SION PRES­I­DENT UR­SULA VON DER LEYEN</p>
    <p>I am deeply shaken by the bru­tal mur­ders in the church in Nice. My thoughts are with the rel­a­tives of those mur­dered and in­jured. Ger­many stands with France at this dif­fi­cult time.</p>
