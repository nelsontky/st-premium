    <p>The 11th edi­tion of the Af­ford­able Art Fair, sched­uled to be held at the F1 Pit Build­ing in Novem­ber, is the lat­est ca­su­alty of the Covid-19 pan­demic. While the phys­i­cal event has been can­celled, fair di­rec­tor Alan Koh noted that the fair has an on­line mar­ket­place “where we help gal­leries sell art 365 days a year in the com­fort of their own gallery”.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE • The Af­ford­able Art Fair has can­celled its 11th edi­tion. The fair, which was sched­uled to be held at the F1 Pit Build­ing in Novem­ber, is the lat­est ca­su­alty of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Fair di­rec­tor Alan Koh told The Straits Times: “We as a fair feel re­spon­si­ble for tak­ing care of our ex­hibitors, part­ners and vis­i­tors and there­fore this de­ci­sion to can­cel (the) Novem­ber 2020 (event) is to safe­guard the in­ter­ests of all of them in this un­cer­tain time, and not to put them at risk, health-wise and fi­nan­cially.”</p>
    <p>He added that more than 75 gal­leries had ap­plied for this year’s fair, not in­clud­ing those which were un­cer­tain be­cause of travel re­stric­tions: “Al­most all of these gal­leries would like to roll over to 2021 and have a thirst for events/fairs like ours to be able to op­er­ate again.”</p>
    <p>While the phys­i­cal event has been can­celled, he noted that the fair has an on­line mar­ket­place “where we help gal­leries sell art 365 days a year in the com­fort of their own gallery, and to help gal­leries con­nect with art lovers from all over the world”.</p>
    <p>The fair’s dig­i­tal plat­form reaches 265,000 art lovers and 400,000 fol­low­ers on so­cial me­dia in 10 coun­tries. He added the fair is plan­ning to lever­age this fol­low­ing. “We are in the midst of plan­ning a new on­line ini­tia­tive,” he said.</p>
    <p>The fair, founded in Lon­don two decades ago by gallery owner Will Ram­say, came to Sin­ga­pore in 2010 and has been cred­ited with mak­ing art buy­ing fun and ac­ces­si­ble for main­stream au­di­ences here.</p>
    <p>In its first year, it at­tracted 9,500 vis­i­tors and sold $1.75 mil­lion worth of art. Last year’s edi­tion drew 13,000 vis­i­tors and rang up $3.4 mil­lion in sales.</p>
    <p>The art scene here has been strug­gling with the ef­fects of the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Vet­eran gallery Chan + Hori Con­tem­po­rary closed its brick-and-mor­tar gallery in June and the NTU Centre for Con­tem­po­rary Art an­nounced plans to close its ex­hi­bi­tion and stu­dio spa­ces next year. Both venues were lo­cated at the Gill­man Bar­racks arts en­clave.</p>
