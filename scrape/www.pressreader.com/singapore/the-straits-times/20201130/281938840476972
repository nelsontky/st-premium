    <p>Hu­mans are gre­gar­i­ous. Our qual­ity of life de­pends to no small de­gree on our re­la­tion­ships with other peo­ple (Woman’s re­mains found al­most two years af­ter she was last seen, Nov 26).</p>
    <p>Old age is closely as­so­ci­ated with an in­creased ex­pe­ri­ence of iso­la­tion. It is easy to find older peo­ple liv­ing alone and, in many cases, suf­fer­ing the recog­nis­able ef­fects of “soli­tary con­fine­ment”, namely ap­a­thy, de­pres­sion and, ul­ti­mately, self-ne­glect.</p>
    <p>Too of­ten, it is an ac­cepted norm that older peo­ple have to ex­pect, and that it is part of the process of grow­ing old. More­over, so­cial pol­icy is mov­ing away from in­sti­tu­tion­alised forms of care, and con­cen­trat­ing in­stead on main­tain­ing peo­ple in their own homes. While community care poli­cies are soundly based on prin­ci­ples that seek to main­tain peo­ple’s in­de­pen­dence, they can also lead to so­cial iso­la­tion.</p>
    <p>So­cial change has con­trib­uted to the in­creas­ing iso­la­tion of older peo­ple. How­ever, we should not for­get that the fam­ily still per­forms most car­ing func­tions for the ma­jor­ity of older peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The main­te­nance of so­cial en­gage­ment is cru­cial. If older peo­ple can main­tain a rea­son­able level of so­cial in­volve­ment, in­clud­ing hav­ing sat­is­fy­ing re­la­tion­ships with other peo­ple, their qual­ity of life can re­main as ful­fill­ing as at any other stage of their lives.</p>
    <p>No one has the abil­ity to live in iso­la­tion. In­stead of keep­ing to the com­fort of our homes, we could show up without mo­tive at the doorsteps of the el­derly and lonely neigh­bours around us, bring­ing them what they need.</p>
    <p>Who does not need hope in their lives? Hope that some­thing can change, that some­one cares, that not only can bad things hap­pen un­ex­pect­edly but good things can also hap­pen to us. Sher­man Goh Keng Hwee</p>
