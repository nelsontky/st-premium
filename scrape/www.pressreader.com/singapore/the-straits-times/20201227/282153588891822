    <p>MARK LEE, 52 Ac­tor-co­me­dian</p>
    <p>Vet­eran fun­ny­man Mark Lee had his day in the sun as the year drew to a rainy close.</p>
    <p>The 52-year-old had two box-of­fice-top­ping movie re­leases these past weeks – the drag queen mu­si­cal Num­ber 1 and the Jack Neo fea­ture The Diam Diam Era.</p>
    <p>Both movies, now show­ing in cin­e­mas here, have crossed the lo­cal box-of­fice mile­stones of $852,000 and $1.37 mil­lion re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>But it was Num­ber 1 – in which Lee plays a re­trenched civil en­gi­neer who finds a job at a drag night­club – that gar­nered him a Golden Horse Award nom­i­na­tion, the most pres­ti­gious recog­ni­tion of his 30-year ca­reer.</p>
    <p>He was nom­i­nated for Best Leading Ac­tor, the sec­ond Sin­ga­porean to be nom­i­nated in the cat­e­gory since Gur­mit Singh for Just Fol­low Law (2007).</p>
    <p>While Lee ul­ti­mately lost to Tai­wanese ac­tor Mo Tzu-yi, who won for his per­for­mance in Dear Ten­ant, Num­ber 1 took home Best Make-up and Cos­tume De­sign.</p>
    <p>Lee con­fessed that he felt dis­ap­pointed go­ing home emp­tyended, es­pe­cially af­ter serv­ing a manda­tory 14-day quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Still, the chance to go to the awards cer­e­mony held in Taipei was well worth it.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back on the year, he tells ST: “Of course, my great­est ac­com­plish­ment this year is get­ting nom­i­nated for the Golden Horse Awards as Best Leading Ac­tor. Even though I didn’t win, I still feel I have gained so much.</p>
    <p>“In my en­tire act­ing and film ca­reer, I’ve fi­nally been recog­nised by the Golden Horse Awards, so I’m very happy. This is a year of har­vest for me.”</p>
    <p>Num­ber 1 will pre­miere in cin­e­mas in Tai­wan early next year – giv­ing a fur­ther boost to the film.</p>
    <p>Aside from act­ing, Lee has many off-screen achieve­ments this year.</p>
    <p>His chicken rice and cof­fee ven­ture, 13 Stages, pulled through the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod by re­ly­ing on de­liv­er­ies. It also re­cently picked up the best chicken rice ac­co­lade i n the Ha­lal Awards or­gan­ised by Ha­lal Food Hunt, a lo­cal on­line plat­form con­nect­ing ha­lal mer­chants and cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>King Kong Me­dia Pro­duc­tion, the me­dia com­pany he founded, is also one of the cor­ner­stone in­vestors in the re­cent ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing of entertainm­ent and con­tent provider G.H.Y Cul­ture & Me­dia in Sin­ga­pore. The newly listed com­pany is fronted by Chi­nese di­rec­tor Guo Jingyu, which bodes for more col­lab­o­ra­tion be­tween the two com­pa­nies in the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Next year, Lee will put his fo­cus on more on­line ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He says: “It’ll still be a tough year for films next year – to find in­vestors and so on. So I’ll fo­cus on on­line plat­forms, maybe work with over­seas plat­forms on va­ri­ety se­ries or short films.</p>
    <p>“I hope we’ll weather Covid-19 and that the film in­dus­try will re­cover quickly from the pan­demic. I’m look­ing for­ward to a ful­fill­ing year ahead.”</p>

    <p>Even though I didn’t win, I still feel I have gained so much... I’ve fi­nally been recog­nised by the Golden Horse Awards, so I’m very happy. This is a year of har­vest for me.</p>
