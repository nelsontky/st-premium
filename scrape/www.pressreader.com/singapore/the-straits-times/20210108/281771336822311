    <p>IS­SUE POLITI­CISED</p>
    <p>Malaysia’s Reg­is­trar of So­ci­eties (RoS) has re­jected an ap­pli­ca­tion by for­mer prime min­is­ter Ma­hathir Mo­hamad’s Parti Pe­juang Tanah Air (Pe­juang) to be reg­is­tered as a po­lit­i­cal party.</p>
    <p>“They gave the rea­son that we did not ful­fil some cri­te­ria and our ap­pli­ca­tion was re­jected,” Tun Dr Ma­hathir told a news con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, adding that the party would lodge an ap­peal to the Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter to­day.</p>
    <p>“Our sec­re­tary-gen­eral fre­quently met up with RoS (dur­ing the process) and they in­formed us ver­bally that everything was okay and would be ap­proved, but that they would re­fer to the (Home Af­fairs) Min­is­ter,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This means that the ad­min­is­tra­tive process has be­come po­lit­i­cal. Why do you need to re­fer to the min­is­ter, it is not re­quired un­der the law.”</p>
    <p>The RoS yes­ter­day also re­jected a sep­a­rate ap­pli­ca­tion to regis­ter the new Malaysian United Demo­cratic Al­liance (Muda) party for youth, led by for­mer Cab­i­net min­is­ter Syed Sad­diq Ab­dul Rah­man.</p>
    <p>Muda co-founder Luq­man Long said the reg­is­trar had sent an email on Wed­nes­day about the re­jec­tion of the party’s ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir and four other MPs formed Pe­juang, or Fight­ers of the Na­tion Party, fol­low­ing their sack­ing from Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia (Ber­satu) i n May last year af­ter they sat with op­po­si­tion MPs in a par­lia­men­tary ses­sion that month.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu is now led by Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin.</p>
    <p>Pe­juang sub­mit­ted its ap­pli­ca­tion to the RoS to be­come a reg­is­tered po­lit­i­cal party at the RoS head­quar­ters i n Pu­tra­jaya on Aug 19.</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, the RoS brushed aside a com­plaint by Pe­juang that there had been no word on the party’s ap­pli­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber, Pe­juang filed a ju­di­cial re­view ap­pli­ca­tion to com­pel the RoS to de­cide on its reg­is­tra­tion sta­tus, but the case is now aca­demic as the RoS has made a de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Op­po­si­tion l eader and Parti Kead­i­lan Rakyat pres­i­dent An­war Ibrahim said yes­ter­day that the move to re­ject the reg­is­tra­tion of Pe­juang and Muda was “com­pletely un­ac­cept­able”.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese rights are en­shrined in our Fed­eral Con­sti­tu­tion. We must de­mand that the Reg­is­trar state to all of us why th­ese two par­ties were de­nied reg­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>“The of­fice of the RoS is not a po­lit­i­cal tool for the gov­ern­ment to use and ma­nip­u­late to suit its agenda,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>If the two par­ties are still not reg­is­tered by the next elec­tion, the politi­cians be­hind them can run as in­de­pen­dents, or on the tick­ets of other par­ties, said po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Awang Az­man Awang Pawi from Univer­siti Malaya.</p>
    <p>A Pe­juang politi­cian ran in a by­elec­tion in Perak state last year as an in­de­pen­dent.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Dr Ma­hathir was also asked on what ad­vice he would give to PM Muhyid­din, amid in­fight­ing within the shaky rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional coali­tion.</p>
    <p>Umno had re­cently threat­ened to stop work­ing with Tan Sri Muhyid­din’s Ber­satu party at the next gen­eral elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir said: “The best ad­vice is that you don’t look strong enough, just re­sign.”</p>
    <p>This means that the ad­min­is­tra­tive process has be­come po­lit­i­cal. Why do you need to re­fer to the min­is­ter, it is not re­quired un­der the law.</p>
