    <p>Find­ing a job and start­ing a ca­reer should be a thrilling time for young peo­ple, but with the pan­demic stran­gling the job mar­ket, the ex­pe­ri­ence has been daunt­ing and anx­i­ety-in­duc­ing in­stead.</p>
    <p>Some grad­u­ates had job of­fers with­drawn, while oth­ers had their in­tern­ships cut short. Some be­gan new jobs only to end up hav­ing to switch to other paths when things did not work out.</p>
    <p>But there is some­thing about the re­silience and op­ti­mism of youth that is see­ing them through.</p>
    <p>Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) busi­ness grad­u­ate Rachel Tsang, 23, who had some job of­fers with­drawn, says: “I was emo­tion­ally af­fected by my cir­cum­stances, although I knew it was not my fault since the econ­omy was not do­ing well and it was not within my con­trol.”</p>
    <p>Like this year’s crop of fresh grad­u­ates, she of­fi­cially left school in July.</p>
    <p>She de­cided to look for learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and the chance to gain trans­fer­able skills. She is now a trainee in a role aligned with her in­ter­ests in sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>NTU en­gi­neer­ing un­der­grad­u­ate Lim Xuan Zheng, 25, found his six­month in­tern­ship with Is­raeli con­struc­tion start-up CivDrone cut short when the Gov­ern­ment re­called over­seas stu­dents.</p>
    <p>He says: “Find­ing an in­tern­ship place­ment was par­tic­u­larly dif­fi­cult when I came back to Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Although he had planned to ap­ply for prod­uct man­age­ment roles ahead of his grad­u­a­tion next May, he said he might look for a more tech­ni­cal job in­stead, which could be less com­pet­i­tive.</p>
    <p>NTU busi­ness stu­dent Muham­mad Ir­fan­ul­lah Mo­hamed Kasim Aman­ul­lah, 24, had his in­tern­ship in Ethiopia can­celled. The in­tern­ship had come with a schol­ar­ship and the chance to be con­verted to a full-time job.</p>
    <p>“As long as I am will­ing to learn and adapt to the chang­ing en­vi­ron­ment, I be­lieve I will be able to se­cure a job in the fu­ture,” he says.</p>
    <p>“To help me stay rel­e­vant in the job mar­ket, I have been tak­ing cour­ses on (on­line ed­u­ca­tion plat­form) Cours­era. By up­skilling my­self dur­ing this pe­riod, I be­lieve I will be able to pur­sue my ca­reer as­pi­ra­tions even if Covid-19 is around for the next few years.”</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power es­ti­mates that about 41,300 res­i­dents be­low 30 years old were un­em­ployed in June, ac­cord­ing to pre­lim­i­nary fig­ures. The sea­son­ally ad­justed res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate for those be­low 30 stood at 7.3 per cent in June, higher than the 6.8 per cent in March this year and the 6 per cent in June last year.</p>
    <p>Arts man­age­ment grad­u­ate from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts Priscilla Wee, 23, says the search since May for jobs such as gallery as­sis­tant or arts pro­gram­mer has been tough.</p>
    <p>She says: “I am slowly start­ing to think about ex­pand­ing my search to other com­pa­nies or maybe try a mar­ket­ing job. It’s not been easy... and I’ve had to change my ex­pec­ta­tions for not just salary but also job se­cu­rity.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity (SMU) busi­ness stu­dent Vic­to­ria Neo, 23, says she may ex­pand her op­tions from jobs in mar­ket­ing and brand­ing to en­trepreneur­ship in the on­line space.</p>
    <p>She says: “I think it re­ally puts what I want to do in the fu­ture into per­spec­tive. It’s so un­cer­tain.”</p>
    <p>Some young peo­ple are opt­ing for trainee­ships in the mean­time to gain ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>SMU law stu­dent Gwee Jia Wei, 23, who is a trainee at the Centre for Re­search On Suc­cess­ful Age­ing, says: “I think tak­ing on in­tern­ships would def­i­nitely help, as (it) proves you have ex­po­sure and some train­ing.”</p>
    <p>Fel­low trainee and eco­nomics grad­u­ate Yew Jee Yuen, 27, still hopes to find a re­search-re­lated job when things im­prove.</p>
    <p>“While the emer­gence of the pan­demic made it dif­fi­cult to se­cure full-time op­por­tu­ni­ties, and may have tem­porar­ily dis­rupted my ca</p>
    <p>I couldn’t af­ford to wait un­til I landed a full-time job. I felt like I was wast­ing a valu­able op­por­tu­nity if I did not sign up for such a pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>REPUB­LIC POLYTECH­NIC GRAD­U­ATE NUR SAKINAH MOHD NOOR,</p>
    <p>reer plans, I still as­pire to do what I had orig­i­nally set out to do.”</p>
    <p>Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ho Kong Chong says: “Young peo­ple want to find short-term safe har­bours, but they haven’t given up on their dream jobs. In the mean­time, they’re try­ing for some­thing short term un­til op­por­tu­ni­ties open up again.”</p>
    <p>Repub­lic Polytech­nic grad­u­ate Nur Sakinah Mohd Noor, 21, says the job hunt since May has been chal­leng­ing, as she had to com­pete not just with fel­low grad­u­ates, but also with work­ers who were re­trenched.</p>
    <p>So, she de­cided to take a trainee­ship as a sales ad­min­is­tra­tor with man­u­fac­turer 3D Me­tal­forge.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t af­ford to wait un­til I landed a full-time job. I felt like I was wast­ing a valu­able op­por­tu­nity if I did not sign up for such a pro­gramme,” she says.</p>
    <p>“This will also mean I can pol­ish my re­sume by in­clud­ing the skills I have ac­quired dur­ing the trainee­ship. Aside from get­ting skills and knowl­edge and a boosted re­sume, the com­pany may con­vert trainees to a full-time po­si­tion. I be­lieve there is noth­ing to lose.”</p>
    <p>Berklee Col­lege of Mu­sic grad­u­ate Cherie Rui Min’s plans of a mu­sic ca­reer in Los An­ge­les also went up in smoke. In­stead, the 24-yearold came home, and launched mu­sic school Vine Mu­sic Stu­dio this year. She also or­gan­ised an on­line char­ity con­cert to help un­der­priv­i­leged women.</p>
    <p>“We have to adapt and find ways to pur­sue our pas­sions while mak­ing a liv­ing,” she says.</p>
    <p>But even those who had jobs had to grap­ple with new­found un­cer­tainty or find ex­tra sources of in­come.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan Hui Lin, 23, worked in the fam­ily busi­ness, man­ag­ing beauty pageants with her mother.</p>
    <p>She says: “Events were the main source of our fam­ily’s in­come and the pan­demic caused a sig­nif­i­cant im­pact as ev­ery­thing was held up.”</p>
    <p>So Ms Tan tapped her en­trepreneur­ial vein, cre­at­ing flo­ral ar­range­ment busi­ness Blooms & Buds SG and a home-based pork slider bun busi­ness called Kiap It. She is also ex­plor­ing jew­ellery sales on­line.</p>
    <p>She is not the only one.</p>
    <p>Mas­ter of cer­e­monies and sports coach de­vel­oper El­son Leong, 30, con­ducted on­line train­ing, de­liv­ered parcels and man­aged swab test­ing sites when the pan­demic put a stop to phys­i­cal events.</p>
    <p>He says: “I have taken an op­ti­mistic at­ti­tude to­wards all that has hap­pened. I am open to ex­plor­ing more op­tions if op­por­tu­ni­ties arise.”</p>
    <p>Some jug­gle work and school, like SMU eco­nomics un­der­grad­u­ate Jar­rod Wong, 23, who is also work­ing with IPP Fi­nan­cial Ad­vis­ers. “I think that fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory will al­ways be in de­mand and is per­haps even more im­por­tant when the econ­omy is volatile and un­cer­tain,” he says.</p>
    <p>Para­dox­i­cally, the pan­demic has in­stilled flex­i­bil­ity and adapt­abil­ity in this gen­er­a­tion, say ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Man­pow­erGroup Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>coun­try man­ager Linda Teo says: “The pan­demic may have also prompted some to re-eval­u­ate their ca­reer plans, with some de­cid­ing to switch to jobs that help them gain a greater pur­pose in life or in­dus­tries with more growth op­por­tu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>NTU As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Trevor Yu says: “The chal­leng­ing con­di­tions of the job mar­ket may sug­gest that peo­ple may be more will­ing to ex­plore dif­fer­ent types of ca­reer paths, com­pared with the tra­di­tional climb­ing of cor­po­rate lad­ders, and non-stan­dard work ar­range­ments, such as con­tract­based or part-time work and ap­pren­tice­ships.”</p>
    <p>And all is not lost, as the pan­demic has ex­panded the realm of pos­si­bil­i­ties, for in­stance by al­low­ing peo­ple to work re­motely for over­seas firms, says SMU Pro­fes­sor Paulin Straughan.</p>
    <p>“It has shifted us to imag­ine a lit­tle bit more. In the past, grad­u­ates were very tra­di­tional and stuck to big firms, but now, they look around and see which com­pa­nies have risen from this.”</p>
