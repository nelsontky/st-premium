    <p>United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den will hold du­elling prime-time town halls in­stead of their sec­ond pres­i­den­tial de­bate, which was can­celled after Mr Trump de­clined to take part in a vir­tual match-up. Mr Trump’s town hall will take place in Mi­ami, while Mr Bi­den will ap­pear in Philadel­phia.</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re­fusal to hold a vir­tual town hall de­bate with his Demo­cratic ri­val Joe Bi­den after his hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion for the coro­n­avirus has cre­ated one of the stranger events of the 2020 cam­paign – two town halls, each fea­tur­ing a can­di­date, be­fore dif­fer­ent au­di­ences in dif­fer­ent cities at the same time.</p>
    <p>The con­cur­rent hour-long events – start­ing at 8pm in New York (8am to­day in Sin­ga­pore) with Mr Trump on NBC and Mr Bi­den on ABC – threaten to frac­ture tele­vi­sion view­er­ship, mak­ing it harder for the can­di­dates to de­liver their mes­sages to a broad au­di­ence. NBC News said Mr Trump’s event in Mi­ami would take place out­doors to pre­vent the spread of the coro­n­avirus. Mr Bi­den’s ABC News event will take place in Philadel­phia.</p>
    <p>The event will give Mr Trump one of his high­est-pro­file op­por­tu­ni­ties be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion to re­verse his slide in polls that show Mr Bi­den ahead.</p>
    <p>In­stead of spar­ring with each other over top­ics such as the han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, the econ­omy and health­care, the town hall for­mat gives the can­di­dates a less con­tentious op­por­tu­nity to lay out their po­si­tions, and en­gage one-on-one with vot­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump backed out of the orig­i­nally sched­uled de­bate for yes­ter­day that was planned as a town hall for­mat. His cam­paign re­jected re­vised plans by the non-par­ti­san Com­mis­sion on Pres­i­den­tial De­bates for the can­di­dates to ap­pear re­motely after Mr Trump was hos­pi­talised for Covid-19, in­sist­ing that the Pres­i­dent and his aides – a num­ber of whom also tested pos­i­tive for the virus – posed no health risk.</p>
    <p>With 18 days be­fore the elec­tion, early vot­ing has started in two dozen states. In-per­son and mail-in vot­ing are sur­pass­ing records amid con­cerns about Covid-19 trans­mis­sion at polling places and what strate­gists in both par­ties say is height­ened in­ter­est in the race.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic, which has killed more than 216,000 in the United States and left more than 7 mil­lion in­fected, is sure to be a top topic among vot­ers’ questions for each of the can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>Two-thirds of regis­tered vot­ers say the Pres­i­dent failed to take ap­pro­pri­ate pre­cau­tions against the virus, ac­cord­ing to a Wash­ing­ton Post-ABC News poll re­leased over the weekend.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has ham­mered Mr Trump for his cav­a­lier ap­proach to­wards the pan­demic. The Pres­i­dent has spent re­cent days down­play­ing the threat posed by Covid-19, tout­ing an ex­per­i­men­tal an­ti­body treat­ment he re­ceived while hos­pi­talised and say­ing so­cial-dis­tanc­ing mea­sures ad­vo­cated by Democrats did more harm than good.</p>
    <p>“The cure can­not be worse than the prob­lem it­self,” Mr Trump said on Wed­nes­day in re­marks to the Eco­nomic Club of New York.</p>
    <p>Both can­di­dates are also likely to face questions about the Supreme</p>
    <p>Court. The town halls are tak­ing place dur­ing the con­fir­ma­tion process for Mr Trump’s high court nom­i­nee, Ms Amy Coney Bar­rett.</p>
    <p>Democrats ar­gue that the nom­i­na­tion should not be con­sid­ered while vot­ing for the next pres­i­dent is un­der way. They are warn­ing that Ms Bar­rett could cast a de­cid­ing vote to over­turn the Af­ford­able Care Act, which has be­come in­creas­ingly pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent and his cam­paign aides, mean­while, see the nom­i­na­tion as a way to ac­ti­vate con­ser­va­tive and re­li­gious vot­ers who care deeply about the court’s com­po­si­tion. Ms Bar­rett’s con­fir­ma­tion to the life­time post – a vir­tual cer­tainty given Repub­li­cans’ Se­nate ma­jor­ity – would drive the Supreme Court fur­ther right with a 6-3 con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and other Repub­li­cans have been press­ing Mr Bi­den to say whether he sup­ports adding seats to the court, or “court pack­ing”, an idea that has sup­port from pro­gres­sives who see it as the only way to re­gain a ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>After weeks of duck­ing the ques­tion, Mr Bi­den said on Mon­day that he’s “not a fan of court pack­ing”, but still left open the pos­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump ar­gued that Mr Bi­den’s re­fusal to an­swer is ev­i­dence that the former vice-pres­i­dent is a pup­pet of the more ex­treme el­e­ments of the Demo­cratic Party.</p>
    <p>More than 13 mil­lion Amer­i­cans have al­ready voted, set­ting a record early pace, ac­cord­ing to the US Elec­tions Project at the Univer­sity of Florida.</p>
    <p>Many wanted to avoid the large crowds ex­pected on elec­tion day. In the last polls, in 2016, some 1.4 mil­lion Amer­i­cans had cast early votes as of Oct 16 that year.</p>
