    <p>The unique yet fa­mil­iar ex­pe­ri­ence of eat­ing at hawker cen­tres could soon be in­ter­na­tion­ally recog­nised as a prac­tice to be pro­tected, af­ter an ex­pert body rec­om­mended that Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture be added to the Unesco in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage list.</p>
    <p>A 24-mem­ber Unesco in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal com­mit­tee will give the fi­nal verdict next month, but the report on Mon­day by the in­ter­na­tional eval­u­a­tion body puts Sin­ga­pore in good stead to have its first in­scrip­tion on the list.</p>
    <p>If suc­cess­ful, hawker cul­ture will join more than 463 other items sim­i­larly iden­ti­fied, in­clud­ing Chi­nese shadow pup­petry in China, the mak­ing and shar­ing of kim­chi in North and South Korea, and In­dia’s yoga.</p>
    <p>Ms Chang Hwee Nee, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB), said: “The eval­u­a­tion body’s rec­om­men­da­tion is an af­fir­ma­tion by in­ter­na­tional ex­perts of Sin­ga­pore’s bid.</p>
    <p>“Com­pris­ing a unique com­bi­na­tion of food, space and com­mu­nity, hawker cul­ture has evolved into a mi­cro­cosm of our mul­ti­cul­tural so­ci­ety, and is an in­te­gral part of our liv­ing her­itage.”</p>
    <p>The NHB, the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA)</p>
    <p>and the Fed­er­a­tion of Mer­chants’ As­so­ci­a­tions jointly sub­mit­ted the bid in March last year, although prepara­tory work started ear­lier in April 2018.</p>
    <p>The list, cre­ated by Unesco in 2008, hopes to give added pres­tige to “liv­ing her­itage” such as per­form­ing arts, fes­tive events, rit­u­als and oral tra­di­tions.</p>
    <p>By af­ford­ing en­tries i nter­na­tional recog­ni­tion, it also com­mits states to mak­ing sure th­ese prac­tices are trans­mit­ted to the next gen­er­a­tion, while pro­mot­ing in­ter­cul­tural di­a­logue and mu­tual re­spect for other ways of life.</p>
    <p>If hawker cul­ture is suc­cess­fully in­scribed on the list, Sin­ga­pore will have to sub­mit a report to Unesco ev­ery six years on its ef­forts to safe­guard hawker cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan Meng Dui, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of the NEA, said Sin­ga­pore’s bid it­self al­ready shows the coun­try’s com­mit­ment to the preser­va­tion of hawker cul­ture, and that his agency “re­mains stead­fast” in its ef­forts to at­tract new en­trants and work with cur­rent stake­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>He said: “Hawker cul­ture is syn­ony­mous to Sin­ga­pore, and is a uni­fy­ing cul­ture that binds our peo­ple and so­ci­ety.”</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently about 6,000 hawk­ers spread over 110 hawker cen­tres. Evolv­ing to­gether with Sin­ga­pore’s ur­ban­i­sa­tion through the years, hawk­ers have trans­formed from be­ing in­di­vid­u­als sell­ing their fare on the streets to the stall­hold­ers at the more built-up hawker cen­tres of to­day.</p>
    <p>The report by the ex­perts said that Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture ful­filled all the cri­te­ria in the nom­i­na­tion process, not­ing that the mass par­tic­i­pa­tion by Sin­ga­pore­ans in the ap­pli­ca­tion process re­vealed the pub­lic aware­ness and “sig­nif­i­cant vi­tal­ity” of hawker cul­ture.</p>
    <p>Over 850,000 peo­ple, through var­i­ous means such as at­tend­ing trav­el­ling ex­hi­bi­tions and sign­ing let­ters of con­sent, par­tic­i­pated in gen­er­at­ing the let­ters, pho­to­graphs and videos used in the ap­pli­ca­tion doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>There were 42 sub­mis­sions in this year’s bid, in­clud­ing me­chan­i­cal watch­mak­ing by Switzer­land and France, Budima dance by Zam­bia and tree bee­keep­ing cul­ture by Poland and Be­larus.</p>
    <p>Among th­ese, 25 en­tries – in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore’s – were rec­om­mended to be in­scribed on the of­fi­cial In­tan­gi­ble Cul­tural Her­itage of Hu­man­ity list.</p>
    <p>Unesco refers to the United Na­tions Ed­u­ca­tional, Sci­en­tific and Cul­tural Or­gan­i­sa­tion, which hopes to fur­ther in­ter­na­tional peace through ed­u­ca­tion such as the pro­mo­tion of her­itage.</p>
    <p>The report by the ex­perts said that Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture ful­filled all the cri­te­ria in the nom­i­na­tion process, not­ing that the mass par­tic­i­pa­tion by Sin­ga­pore­ans in the ap­pli­ca­tion process re­vealed the pub­lic aware­ness and “sig­nif­i­cant vi­tal­ity” of hawker cul­ture.</p>
    <p>The chances of Sin­ga­pore’s hawker cul­ture be­ing in­scribed as an of­fi­cial Unesco in­tan­gi­ble cul­tural her­itage have been boosted, with an ex­pert body rec­om­mend­ing that it be put on the list. An eval­u­a­tion body com­pris­ing 12 ex­perts from around the world, ap­pointed by a 24-mem­ber in­ter­gov­ern­men­tal com­mit­tee that will give the fi­nal verdict next month, said in a much-awaited report that Sin­ga­pore’s ap­pli­ca­tion ful­fils all the nec­es­sary cri­te­ria. Although this does not mean that the coun­try’s bid is suc­cess­ful al­ready, there is rea­son to be­lieve that it will go through. The news will not only de­light the 6,000 hawk­ers spread over 110 hawker cen­tres here, but also sharpen the ap­petite and en­hance the ap­pre­ci­a­tion of cul­tural her­itage among all seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion, be­cause there is hardly any­one who has not vis­ited, does not visit, or will not visit a hawker cen­tre in the course of liv­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In­deed, it is im­pos­si­ble to imag­ine Sin­ga­pore with­out the ev­ery­day ap­peal of food at hawker cen­tres. Th­ese cater to the di­verse tastes of a mul­tira­cial pop­u­la­tion, each of whose com­mu­ni­ties pos­sesses a wide range of culi­nary tra­di­tions. What hawker cen­tres do is to bring th­ese culi­nary cul­tures to­gether in an un­ob­tru­sive way that Sin­ga­pore­ans have grown to ap­pre­ci­ate from a young age, and some­times even take for granted. It is not far-fetched to be­lieve that Sin­ga­pore’s mul­ti­cul­tural and cos­mopoli­tan iden­tity would not have flow­ered as it has done with­out the ap­petis­ing cat­alytic role played by hawker food and the cen­tres where it is served day in and day out.</p>
    <p>Cer­tainly, food­courts and restau­rants, too, cel­e­brate Sin­ga­pore’s culi­nary di­ver­sity. But hawker cen­tres are af­ford­able for most Sin­ga­pore­ans, so much so that they have pop­u­larised the habit of eat­ing out fre­quently. In their in­tan­gi­ble way, they have contribute­d to the con­struc­tion of a dis­tinc­tive and en­dur­ing Sin­ga­pore iden­tity. This is not to deny the pres­ence and im­por­tance of hawk­ers in other na­tions. But there can­not be any doubt that hawker cen­tres have played an in­tan­gi­ble and ir­re­place­able role in the fos­ter­ing of a na­tional way of life here. Therein lies the cul­tural ba­sis of the claim to its in­clu­sion in the Unesco list.</p>
    <p>This is also an op­por­tune time to re­flect on the need to keep hawk­ing tra­di­tions alive. Turn­ing hawk­ers into wok stars, along the lines of the so­cial recog­ni­tion and re­spect ac­corded to chefs in fine-din­ing restau­rants, might not be easy. Long hours spent cook­ing and serv­ing cus­tomers in rel­a­tively cramped work­ing con­di­tions mil­i­tate against at­tract­ing the young into the pro­fes­sion. But “hawk­er­preneurs” could buy an old recipe, or mass pro­duc­tion or a cen­tral kitchen could also be op­tions to con­sider, pro­vided qual­ity and taste can be main­tained. But for th­ese to oc­cur, pa­trons would have to con­tem­plate and be pre­pared to pay a lit­tle more to keep the woks busy.</p>
