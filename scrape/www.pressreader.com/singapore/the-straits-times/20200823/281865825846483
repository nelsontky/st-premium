    <p>It is not a given that peo­ple will pull to­gether in a cri­sis to help one another, but many groups and peo­ple have come to­gether to help one another dur­ing the pan­demic, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health Janil Puthuc­heary said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He noted that this has been one of the sil­ver lin­ings of the Covid-19 pan­demic, and said this com­ing to­gether of the com­mu­nity is what Sin­ga­pore’s SGUnited ef­fort hopes to drive and de­velop.</p>
    <p>He was speak­ing at the Vir­tual Sin­ga­pore Mind­ful­ness Con­fer­ence 2020. The event, held since 2018, had been moved on­line this year for the first time ow­ing to the pan­demic and was made free. Some 4,000 peo­ple signed up this year, com­pared with 1,000 last year.</p>
    <p>Dr Janil noted that if it had been sug­gested a year ago that a con­fer­ence of such scale fea­tur­ing ex­perts from around the world could be or­gan­ised by a team of fewer than 10, most peo­ple would not have been per­suaded.</p>
    <p>But it had been made pos­si­ble in a way by the pan­demic, and was a tes­ta­ment to the will­ing­ness of those in­volved to part­ner one another and work to­gether.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Dr Janil said the pan­demic, like other crises, also sig­nals the im­por­tance and com­plex­ity of en­hanc­ing men­tal and com­mu­nity re­silience.</p>
    <p>He said the pri­mary un­cer­tainty that peo­ple have been grap­pling with is how long the pan­demic will go on, adding that the cur­rent new nor­mal may be the water­mark for some time and peo­ple will have to find a way to adapt and ad­just the way they live, work and play, po­ten­tially for a year or so.</p>
    <p>Adding to this is the un­cer­tainty of the mea­sures, as well as the un­cer­tainty of the ef­fec­tive­ness of what is be­ing done. “What we are all go­ing through is en­tirely nat­u­ral and ex­pected, given the cir­cum­stances,” he said, adding that it would be ab­nor­mal not to feel stress or anx­i­ety or to pre­tend that Covid-19 does not af­fect peo­ple and their re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>This was why the Gov­ern­ment set up the Na­tional Care Hot­line, which is manned by 900 coun­sel­lors, psy­chi­a­trists, so­cial work­ers and pub­lic of­fi­cers, to pro­vide sup­port to the com­mu­nity on men­tal health con­cerns such as anx­i­ety and ad­just­ment is­sues re­lated to Covid-19. As of last Thurs­day, the hot­line had han­dled some 28,000 calls, of which 12,000 were chan­nelled to trained vol­un­teers to ad­min­is­ter psy­cho­log­i­cal first aid.</p>
    <p>The is­sue of stress caused by Covid-19 has been in the spot­light.</p>
    <p>Dr Janil noted that agen­cies and the com­mu­nity had been work­ing to ramp up out­reach and sup­port on men­tal health con­cerns for some time. The Agency for In­te­grated Care has set up a net­work of 43 com­mu­nity out­reach teams and trained over 24,000 front-line staff. As of last year, it had reached out to over 300,000 per­sons.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Angie Chew, 56, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Brahm Cen­tre, which co-or­gan­ised the two-day con­fer­ence with the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, said prac­tis­ing mind­ful­ness can help peo­ple fo­cus on the present dur­ing this pe­riod, so that they can stay calm and con­serve en­ergy while they pre­pare for the pos­si­bil­i­ties ahead.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, key­note speaker John Fran­cis, an en­vi­ron­men­tal­ist, urged peo­ple to be kind to one another, par­tic­u­larly dur­ing this pe­riod. The event in­cludes work­shops on how peo­ple can trans­form their diet and man­age age­ing, among other things.</p>
