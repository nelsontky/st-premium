    <p>TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try is more ef­fec­tive for con­tact trac­ing and pro­vides bet­ter cy­ber hy­giene says tech edi­tor Irene Tham. Com­bin­ing the two sys­tems is a good way to get at least 75 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion to take part in con­tact trac­ing, the min­i­mum rate for the sys­tem to per­form the way it was de­signed to.</p>
    <p>By the end of the year, Sin­ga­pore will be switch­ing to a new Covid-19 man­age­ment tool: TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try.</p>
    <p>This sys­tem is more ef­fec­tive for con­tact trac­ing and pro­vides bet­ter cy­ber hy­giene, mak­ing the switchover a no-brainer.</p>
    <p>TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try com­bines what are now two sep­a­rate sys­tems: TraceTo­gether, to iden­tify those in close con­tact with Covid-19 pa­tients; and SafeEn­try – which dig­i­tally checks in vis­i­tors at most venues – to de­ter­mine which premises have been vis­ited by those in­fected with the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Once the in­te­grated TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try sys­tem is fully rolled out, no one will be able to use their phone cam­eras or the SingPass mo­bile app to scan the SafeEn­try QR code to en­ter cin­e­mas, restau­rants, work­places, schools and shopping malls. And venue op­er­a­tors will not scan bar­codes on NRICs to al­low peo­ple en­try.</p>
    <p>With the above-men­tioned check-in meth­ods dis­con­tin­ued, peo­ple will have to use their TraceTo­gether app for scan­ning the SafeEn­try QR code, or TraceTo­gether to­ken, which sports a unique QR code, for scan­ning by venue op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Since SafeEn­try is al­ready manda­tory at most venues, com­bin­ing the two tech­nolo­gies is a con­ve­nient way to also com­pel peo­ple to use TraceTo­gether, which is vol­un­tary at present.</p>
    <p>Why is this move nec­es­sary?</p>
    <p>It is to get at least 75 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion to par­tic­i­pate in dig­i­tal con­tact trac­ing. This is the min­i­mum adop­tion rate re­quired for TraceTo­gether to per­form the way it was de­signed to.</p>
    <p>The TraceTo­gether smart­phone app and wear­able to­ken work by ex­chang­ing Blue­tooth sig­nals with one an­other to iden­tify who has been within 2m of a Covid-19 pa­tient for longer than 30 min­utes.</p>
    <p>This in­for­ma­tion makes for speedy con­tact trac­ing to curb the spread of Covid-19. With­out it, Sin­ga­pore would not be able to host more trav­ellers, busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties and so­cial gath­er­ings un­der phase three of its re­open­ing.</p>
    <p>QR CODE SCAMS</p>
    <p>Cy­ber hy­giene is where it gets re­ally in­ter­est­ing: QR code scan­ning with a phone cam­era makes one vul­ner­a­ble to scam­ming.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have not warned the pub­lic against us­ing their smart­phone cam­era to scan the SafeEn­try QR code. But scan­ning the SafeEn­try QR code us­ing the phone cam­era is un­safe.</p>
    <p>A hacker in­tent on har­vest­ing a data­base of NRIC and phone num­bers can eas­ily re­place the SafeEn­try QR code with a rogue code that points users to a fake on­line form. This is not some­thing a smart­phone cam­era can de­tect or pre­vent.</p>
    <p>It is easy to re­place QR codes since they are pub­licly dis­played.</p>
    <p>QR code scams have be­come a con­cern of late, as peo­ple are be­com­ing more de­pen­dent on dig­i­tal tools. The en­tire na­tion be­came used to the idea of scan­ning a QR code af­ter SafeEn­try use was man­dated at most venues in May.</p>
    <p>Now, peo­ple are scan­ning a QR code to pay for their bub­ble tea or down­load lo­ca­tion maps, dis­count coupons, prod­uct in­for­ma­tion and restau­rant menus. But most users are not con­scious of the dan­gers as­so­ci­ated with QR codes. This is prac­ti­cally a gift to cy­ber­crooks.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, QR codes can be en­coded with ma­li­cious links to reroute users to fake web­sites, where they are asked for sen­si­tive in­for­ma­tion such as bank­ing cre­den­tials.</p>
    <p>Ma­li­cious links may also bring users to mal­ware-in­fested web­sites where snoop­ing pro­grams can be un­know­ingly down­loaded.</p>
    <p>Recognisin­g this prob­lem, the Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency (CSA) of Sin­ga­pore has warned the pub­lic about the per­ils as­so­ci­ated with scan­ning QR codes.</p>
    <p>“It is easy for an at­tacker to print and su­per­im­pose his own ma­li­cious QR codes on top of the le­git­i­mate QR codes,” CSA posted on its web­site. “You might be­come the vic­tim of a phish­ing oper­a­tion if you in­put your lo­gin cre­den­tials af­ter scan­ning a QR code.”</p>
    <p>En­ter­ing venues us­ing the SingPass app helps to get around the QR code safety is­sue, but the app is bloated and slow. Plus, the SingPass app does not have the Blue­tooth ca­pa­bil­i­ties of TraceTo­gether.</p>
    <p>En­ter TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try.</p>
    <p>The TraceTo­gether app is able to val­i­date the QR code it scans. When it comes across an un­sanc­tioned QR code, the app will alert users with: “This doesn’t seem like a SafeEn­try QR code.”</p>
    <p>To­ken users, how­ever, need not scan any­thing. The to­ken sports a unique QR code for scan­ning by venue op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>As at Nov 1, about 570,000 to­kens had been given out and 2.7 mil­lion TraceTo­gether app down­loads reg­is­tered.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties plan to pro­duce 2.7 mil­lion to­kens or more, if de­mand goes up.</p>
    <p>It is in ev­ery­one’s in­ter­est to switch over to the new TraceTo­gether-only SafeEn­try sys­tem and to do so quickly.</p>
    <p>Not only will its use cur­tail huge op­por­tu­nity costs from de­layed travel and busi­ness ac­tiv­ity re­sump­tion – or worse still, an­other cir­cuit breaker – the new sys­tem will also plug ex­ist­ing cy­ber hy­giene gaps that could lead to mas­sive data leaks.</p>
    <p>A hacker in­tent on har­vest­ing a data­base of NRIC and phone num­bers can eas­ily re­place the SafeEn­try QR code with a rogue code that points users to a fake on­line form. This is not some­thing the smart­phone cam­era can de­tect or pre­vent.</p>
    <p>It is easy to re­place QR codes since they are pub­licly dis­played.</p>
