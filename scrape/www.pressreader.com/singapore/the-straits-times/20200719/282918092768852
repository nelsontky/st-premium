    <p>When I de­cided a few years ago to spend US$150,000 (S$209,000) on a master of busi­ness ad­min­is­tra­tion (MBA) de­gree while a reporter at Bloomberg, I had an am­bi­tious goal: be the best fi­nan­cial reporter the world has ever seen.</p>
    <p>This de­gree, I thought, would help me bet­ter un­der­stand the work­ings of Wall Street. It would also give me a leg up in an in­dus­try still dom­i­nated by white men and plagued by job losses.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, many of my class­mates at New York Univer­sity’s Stern School of Busi­ness had fairly straight­for­ward plans. They wanted to be pro­moted to a di­rec­tor’s po­si­tion at UBS, get into Bain’s first-year pro­gramme or move on from a non-profit. Al­most ev­ery­one in the grad­u­at­ing class ex­pected to spend May this year lock­ing in ca­reer op­por­tu­ni­ties and be­ing cat­a­pulted into new, bet­ter lives.</p>
    <p>In­stead, my grad­u­at­ing class has now been watch­ing its op­tions dis­ap­pear, as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic paral­ysed the US econ­omy.</p>
    <p>New MBAs would be look­ing for work while cor­po­rate Amer­ica was busy lay­ing off peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“I just in­vested US$150,000 in an ed­u­ca­tion that’s sup­posed to pro­vide an ROI of 300 per cent to 400 per cent,” my class­mate Emal Rustemi said. “How do I cap­ture that? We have hit rock bot­tom. The world econ­omy has stopped.”</p>
    <p>Many of us are im­mi­grants or first-gen­er­a­tion Amer­i­cans, and the MBA was sup­posed to be a step­ping stone to the kind of job that we couldn’t get through fam­ily con­nec­tions. The classes with pro­fes­sors such as Nouriel Roubini, Aswath Damodaran and Scott Gal­loway; all-you-can-drink beer hall af­ter class in the NYU base­ment; trips my class­mates took to places like Aus­tralia, Tel Aviv or Hong Kong to learn about do­ing busi­ness abroad – that’s what would set our lives on the right track.</p>
    <p>And, of course, there was that</p>
    <p>US$150,000. It was a risk, but I thought in­vest­ing in my­self would be a bet­ter bet than buy­ing real es­tate. Af­ter all, just look at the stats: The av­er­age start­ing salary for an MBA grad in 2019 was US$115,000, com­pared with US$55,000 for peo­ple with bach­e­lor’s de­grees, ac­cord­ing to the Grad­u­ate Man­age­ment Ad­mis­sion Council.</p>
    <p>Plus, over the past few years, it felt safe to take a leap. It was easy to get stu­dent loans to finance tu­ition. Un­em­ploy­ment was low, so the­o­ret­i­cally there would be fierce com­pe­ti­tion to hire or pro­mote us.</p>
    <p>My class­mates moved eas­ily in and out of jobs. One of them quit her job in mar­ket­ing for Saks Fifth Avenue in the mid­dle of B-school and quickly found work again at tooth­brush start-up Quip. An­other class­mate last year told me how he’d turned down a job in New York to run part of a bil­lion­aire’s fam­ily of­fice, the kind of job that can pay up­wards of US$300,000 in an in­vest­ment bank­ing-type role, and can in­stantly make your de­gree worth it.</p>
    <p>We were all so cocky. We could do any­thing we wanted. Would I take the plunge again now?</p>
    <p>To our par­ents’ gen­er­a­tion, an MBA was a sig­nal that the bearer was suc­cess­ful, both fi­nan­cially and in the busi­ness world. For some com­pa­nies, it was a ba­sic re­quire­ment of em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Now, we are wor­ried about whether per­cep­tions are chang­ing. Ap­pli­ca­tions to MBA pro­grammes have been fall­ing over the past few years. Pur­due Univer­sity said this year that it would be shut­ting down its res­i­den­tial MBA pro­gramme, once one of the top 30 in the United States. How many more will fol­low suit? Will em­ploy­ers make the MBA op­tional, like some col­leges are do­ing with the SAT?</p>
    <p>To ad­just, many of us are re­defin­ing what it means to be suc­cess­ful, and even what we want out of life. “The world is giv­ing you a chance to re­assess your pri­or­i­ties and do what you want,” my friend Shao Zhou said.</p>
    <p>I recog­nise how lucky I am to still have my job, re­port­ing on Wall Street, at a time when many news­rooms are down­siz­ing and lay­offs more gen­er­ally are soar­ing. I have a rare op­por­tu­nity to in­ter­view CEOs and peo­ple mak­ing de­ci­sions about what the work­force will look like in the fu­ture. I have to be­lieve that my stud­ies have helped me to flu­idly trans­late “in­vestor speak” into a story on-air.</p>
    <p>Course­work on how to value a com­pany, dis­count cash flows and boot­strap a yield curve helped me learn how to pick apart the in­ner work­ings of finance. But the work on lead­er­ship and ethics – re­quired cour­ses that I had to drag my­self to at­tend – had some of the most last­ing im­pacts.</p>
