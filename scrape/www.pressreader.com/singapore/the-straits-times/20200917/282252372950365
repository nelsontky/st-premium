    <p>Cus­tomers will have eas­ier ac­cess to prod­ucts such as health in­surance and in­vest­ment and sav­ings plans once Aviva and Sin­ga­pore Life com­plete a $3.2 bil­lion merger an­nounced late last week.</p>
    <p>The pledge came from Singlife group chief ex­ec­u­tive Wal­ter de Oude, who also told The Straits Times on Tues­day that ex­ist­ing pol­i­cy­holder terms and con­di­tions will not be af­fected.</p>
    <p>“All that will hap­pen over time is that the way we en­gage with cus­tomers will be­come more dig­i­tal and mo­bile as the busi­ness builds up its ca­pa­bil­i­ties,” he noted.</p>
    <p>“We have ob­served that al­though cus­tomers pre­fer to have a dig­i­tal and mo­bile-first re­la­tion­ship with their fi­nan­cial ser­vices provider, they still like to have in­de­pen­dent and good qual­ity of fi­nan­cial ad­vice,” he said.</p>
    <p>“All of our prod­ucts and ser­vices will be geared to di­rect en­gage­ment.”</p>
    <p>Home-grown Singlife was set up in 2017 and now has 50,000 cus­tomers, a num­ber that it said in­creases by about 450 ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>The fully li­censed di­rect life in­surer of­fers dig­i­tal pro­tec­tion and sav­ings so­lu­tions through the Singlife Ac­count app, which al­lows users to with­draw money at any time or spend it through a Singlife Visa debit card.</p>
    <p>Be­sides its Sin­ga­pore busi­ness, the in­surer has part­nered mo­bile payments com­pany GCash in the Philip­pines to roll out mi­cro-in­surance prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>It also plans to ex­pand to Malaysia, Thai­land, Viet­nam and In­done­sia after the merger with Aviva is com­plete, said Mr de Oude.</p>
    <p>Singlife an­nounced last Fri­day that it plans to merge with Aviva Sin­ga­pore in a deal val­ued at $3.2 bil­lion, mak­ing it the largest in the in­surance sec­tor in Sin­ga­pore and one of the largest in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>The trans­ac­tion is ex­pected to com­plete by Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>Mr de Oude said the move will al­low Singlife to take “all of the tech­no­log­i­cal ad­vance­ment that we have cre­ated, com­bin­ing it with the deep prod­uct his­tory, large cus­tomer seg­ment and qual­ity ad­vi­sory ca­pa­bil­i­ties in the Aviva busi­ness”.</p>
    <p>Aviva Sin­ga­pore had about 1.5 mil­lion cus­tomers and man­aged $11.8 bil­lion in as­sets as at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>Mr de Oude noted that Aviva is one of the firms ap­pointed by the Min­istry of Health to run se­vere dis­abil­ity in­surance scheme ElderShiel­d.</p>
    <p>It also of­fers a group in­surance scheme with the Gov­ern­ment for na­tional ser­vice­men.</p>
    <p>“These sug­gest a very com­pre­hen­sive prod­uct base in ex­is­tence,” he noted.</p>
    <p>“Our job, go­ing for­ward, is to re­fine and im­prove that prod­uct base for cus­tomers as we evolve the busi­ness into a more dig­i­tally em­brac­ing or­gan­i­sa­tion.”</p>
    <p>Singlife, which man­ages about $7 bil­lion in life in­surance cov­er­age, ac­quired Zurich Life Sin­ga­pore in 2018.</p>
    <p>“The Singlife-Aviva merger is much more com­pli­cated and will take some time to in­te­grate... but our ex­pe­ri­ence in the Zurich case sug­gests we are well equipped to go for­ward,” said Mr de Oude.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts said Singlife’s lat­est move bodes well for the busi­ness and in­surance sec­tors.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant pro­fes­sor of fi­nance Aurobindo Ghosh from Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s Lee Kong Chian School of Busi­ness said: “This would help them in­crease scal­a­bil­ity in their prod­uct suite and re­duce cost of op­er­a­tions us­ing in­surtech so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>“For cus­tomers, it will pro­vide a one-stop shop for mul­ti­ple prod­ucts in in­surance, and pos­si­bly fi­nan­cial and re­tire­ment plan­ning.</p>
    <p>He added that the com­bined en­tity “might also get in­creas­ing re­turns to scale in terms of cost, which can po­ten­tially be passed on to con­sumers”.</p>
    <p>Mr Ivan Guan, as­so­ciate di­rec­tor at fi­nan­cial ad­vi­sory PromiseLan­d In­de­pen­dent, said the move will cre­ate more brand aware­ness for Singlife.</p>
    <p>“The chal­lenge for Singlife is that its name is not well known... whereas Aviva al­ready has an es­tab­lished pres­ence here,” he said.</p>
    <p>“When they launch new in­no­va­tive prod­ucts in the fu­ture, they will prob­a­bly be more ac­cepted by con­sumers.”</p>
    <p>The Singlife-Aviva merger is much more com­pli­cated and will take some time to in­te­grate... but our ex­pe­ri­ence in the Zurich case sug­gests we are well equipped to go for­ward.</p>
