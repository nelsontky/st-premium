    <p>Dr Cham Tao Soon, the found­ing pres­i­dent of Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU), is a pi­o­neer and an in­de­pen­dent thinker.</p>
    <p>He is not one to mince his words, even in re­tire­ment.</p>
    <p>He lamented that NTU, which started as a prac­tice-ori­ented univer­sity, is now con­cen­trat­ing too much on re­search, and he thinks it pays too much at­ten­tion to rank­ings (Life is noth­ing but solv­ing prob­lems, Dec 3).</p>
    <p>In 1981, when Dr Cham launched the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal In­sti­tute (NTI), the pre­cur­sor to NTU, I was a first-year en­gi­neer­ing stu­dent at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS). The safe and proven path then was to fin­ish my next three years at NUS.</p>
    <p>But I was in­spired by Dr Cham’s vi­sion of prac­tice-ori­ented en­gi­neers who are able to roll up their sleeves, grab a tool­box and fix real-life en­gi­neer­ing prob­lems in the field.</p>
    <p>We did have a taste of that in our first year at NTI with the op­por­tu­nity to take apart a Dai­hatsu van and re­assem­ble it.</p>
    <p>Dr Cham also dan­gled the po­ten­tial for us to grad­u­ate from NTI and then work with the univer­sity to spin off en­gi­neer­ing start-ups.</p>
    <p>Al­most 40 years later, this as­pect of Dr Cham’s vi­sion still seems to be a dis­tant dream.</p>
    <p>But there is hope.</p>
    <p>This year, NanoFilm de­buted on Sin­ga­pore’s stock ex­change with over­whelm­ing suc­cess.</p>
    <p>The com­pany started as a tech start-up spun off from NTU, where founder Shi Xu worked as an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor.</p>
    <p>His work found com­mer­cial suc­cess af­ter Ja­panese con­glom­er­ate Hi­tachi sought to adopt his coat­ing tech­nol­ogy to its hard-disk drives.</p>
    <p>But I was in­spired by Dr Cham Tao Soon’s vi­sion of prac­tice-ori­ented en­gi­neers who are able to roll up their sleeves, grab a tool­box and fix real-life en­gi­neer­ing prob­lems in the field.</p>
