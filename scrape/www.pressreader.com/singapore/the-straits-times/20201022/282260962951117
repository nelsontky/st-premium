    <p>Buy­ers are flock­ing back into the shop­house mar­ket af­ter the pan­demic-in­duced lull put the sec­tor in the dol­drums for months.</p>
    <p>Sales are pow­er­ing ahead while new launches are fur­ther ig­nit­ing in­vestor in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>Sav­ills Sin­ga­pore direc­tor of in­vest­ment sales Yap Hui Yee said the rar­ity of such build­ings and their abil­ity to pre­serve their value make them highly at­trac­tive, espe­cially given low in­ter­est rates.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts have also noted the higher yields on com­mer­cial shop­houses over res­i­den­tial prop­erty.</p>
    <p>PropNex as­so­ciate divi­sion direc­tor Loy­alle Chin added that shop­houses are “the per­fect al­ter­na­tive” to pent­houses and good class bun­ga­lows for for­eign in­vestors as they can own cov­eted land in prime dis­tricts with­out hav­ing to pay ad­di­tional buyer’s stamp duty.</p>
    <p>Re­cent trans­ac­tions in­clude 52 Amoy Street that sold for $8.5 million, 44-46 Amoy Street that went for $21.3 million and 534 North Bridge Road that reaped $10 million. Word is that another shop­house in Amoy Street was pur­chased for close to $30 million.</p>
    <p>A four-storey, 999-year lease­hold con­ser­va­tion shop­house at 14 Mo­hamed Sul­tan Road near Fort Can­ning Park was sold to a de­vel­oper on Tues­day for $12.2 million, noted Is­abel Re­drup Agency.</p>
    <p>It said the buyer plans to trans­form the prop­erty, which can be built up to 10 storeys at its rear, into lux­ury apart­ments.</p>
    <p>Buy­ers still have a wealth of choice, with shop­houses in River Val­ley, Bugis, Telok Ayer and Tiong Bahru among the re­cent launches.</p>
    <p>RIVER VAL­LEY</p>
    <p>They in­clude three ad­join­ing free­hold shop­houses at 262, 264 and 266 River Val­ley Road that are on sale via an ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est, said mar­ket­ing agent Ed­mund Tie.</p>
    <p>They carry a guide price of $2,500 per square foot (psf) based on the to­tal built-up area of about 8,778 sq ft, mak­ing an over­all price of $21.9 million, al­though the three can also be pur­chased separately and have in­di­vid­ual land ti­tles.</p>
    <p>The three fully ten­anted shop­houses have an 18m-wide frontage. They are zoned “res­i­den­tial with com­mer­cial at first storey” with a plot ra­tio of 2.8 and an al­low­able build­ing height of up to four storeys.</p>
    <p>They are in a non-con­ser­va­tion area and so are not sub­ject to the con­ser­va­tion reg­u­la­tions, un­like many shop­houses in prime dis­tricts.</p>
    <p>The ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est ex­er­cise closes at 3pm on Dec 2.</p>
    <p>TELOK AYER</p>
    <p>The home of Swee Kee Eat­ing House – also known as Ka-Soh – at 96 Amoy Street in the Telok Ayer con­ser­va­tion area is on the mar­ket for pur­chase by ten­der, said sole mar­ket­ing agent PropNex Realty.</p>
    <p>Its price starts from $18 million, or about $3,871 psf based on a to­tal built-up area of 4,650 sq ft.</p>
    <p>The 999-year lease­hold prop­erty com­prises two storeys with an at­tic, and spans 2,083 sq ft.</p>
    <p>The Can­tonese-style fish soup restau­rant, which has oc­cu­pied the site for over two decades, is likely to ex­tend its ten­ancy.</p>
    <p>For­eign­ers can buy the prop­erty, and the sale will not in­cur ad­di­tional buyer’s or seller’s stamp duty.</p>
    <p>Amoy Street is within walk­ing dis­tance to Telok Ayer MRT sta­tion and Raf­fles Place. The ten­der closes at 3pm on Nov 26.</p>
    <p>BUGIS</p>
    <p>A shop­house i n Tan Quee Lan Street in Bugis and two others in nearby Bali Lane are up for grabs, also mar­keted by PropNex.</p>
    <p>A 999-year lease­hold site at 5 Tan Quee Lan Street just across from Bugis MRT has an in­dica­tive price start­ing from $15 million.</p>
    <p>All three storeys have been ap­proved for food and bev­er­age use. The shop­house has a gross plot ra­tio of 4.2, with the po­ten­tial to in­crease the floor area up to about 4,629 sq ft.</p>
    <p>It will be sold with the ex­ist­ing ten­ant – South Korean mak­ge­olli bar and restau­rant Joo Bar.</p>
    <p>PropNex noted that a shop­house at 534 North Bridge Road nearby was re­cently sold at $10 million while 32 Liang Seah Street changed hands at $12.2 million.</p>
    <p>Two free­hold shop­houses at 13 and 14 Bali Lane are also on sale with the owner seek­ing a clos­ing price of $9.5 million to $9.8 million.</p>
    <p>They both have two storeys, are zoned “com­mer­cial” and oc­cupy a 1,470 sq ft site and a floor area to­talling 2,616 sq ft.</p>
    <p>The site is next to en­ter­tain­ment venue Blu Jaz Cafe.</p>
    <p>The 999-year lease­hold site where Blu Jaz Cafe sits was sold last year at $18.8 million, or about $4,100 psf while nearby 18 Bali Lane went for $5 million, noted PropNex’s Mr Chin.</p>
    <p>Ten­ders for the three Bugis sites close at 3pm on Nov 26.</p>
    <p>TIONG BAHRU</p>
    <p>A row of four ad­join­ing free­hold con­served shop­houses near Tiong Bahru mar­ket will be put up for sale to­day via an ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>The four-storey shop­houses, at 265, 267, 269 and 271 Ou­tram Road, have an in­dica­tive price of $50 million.</p>
    <p>This trans­lates to about $2,733 psf based on an ex­ist­ing gross floor area of 18,295 sq ft, said Col­liers In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>They have a to­tal land area of 6,125 sq ft and a net let­table area of around 16,049 sq ft.</p>
    <p>The shop­houses are zoned “res­i­den­tial with com­mer­cial at first storey”, with four com­mer­cial units on the first floor and 17 res­i­den­tial units on the up­per floors.</p>
    <p>They are fully oc­cu­pied and will be sold with the ex­ist­ing ten­an­cies, said Col­liers. The ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est ex­er­cise closes on Nov 19, 3pm.</p>
