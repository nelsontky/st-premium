    <p>The num­ber of Covid-19 cases world­wide sur­passed 40 mil­lion yes­ter­day as the on­set of win­ter in the north­ern hemi­sphere fu­elled a resur­gence in the spread of the dis­ease. The pace of the pan­demic con­tin­ues to pick up, tak­ing just 32 days to add an­other 10 mil­lion global cases, com­pared with 38 days and 44 days pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • World­wide coro­n­avirus cases crossed 40 mil­lion yes­ter­day, ac­cord­ing to a Reuters tally, as the on­set of win­ter in the north­ern hemi­sphere fu­elled a resur­gence in the spread of the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>The Reuters tally is based on of­fi­cial re­port­ing by in­di­vid­ual coun­tries. Ex­perts be­lieve the true num­bers of both cases and deaths are likely much higher, given de­fi­cien­cies in testing and po­ten­tial un­der­re­port­ing by some coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The Reuters data shows the pace of the pan­demic con­tin­ues to pick up. It took just 32 days to go from 30 mil­lion global cases to 40 mil­lion, com­pared with the 38 days it took to get from 20 mil­lion to 30 mil­lion, the 44 days between 10 mil­lion and 20 mil­lion, and the three months it took to reach 10 mil­lion cases from when the first in­fec­tions were re­ported in Wuhan, China, in early Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Record one-day in­creases in new in­fec­tions were seen at the end of last week, with global coro­n­avirus cases ris­ing above 400,000 for the first time.</p>
    <p>There were an av­er­age of around 347,000 cases each day over the past week, com­pared with 292,000 in the first week of Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The United States, In­dia and Brazil re­main the worst af­fected coun­tries in the world. Covid-19 cases in North, Cen­tral and South Amer­ica rep­re­sent about 47.27 per cent or nearly half of global cases.</p>
    <p>Around 247 cases are seen per 10,000 peo­ple in the US. For In­dia and Brazil, those num­bers stand at 55 cases and 248 cases per 10,000 peo­ple, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>New cases are grow­ing at over 150,000 a day in Europe, as many coun­tries, in­clud­ing Italy, the Nether­lands, Ger­many, Austria, Poland, Ukraine, Cyprus and the Czech Repub­lic, have re­ported record daily in­creases in the num­ber of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>Europe now ac­counts for over 17 per cent of the global cases and nearly 22 per cent of the deaths re­lated to the virus world­wide.</p>
    <p>Parts of the United King­dom were put un­der lock­down as Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son at­tempted to con­tain a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tions through lo­cal mea­sures.</p>
    <p>France im­posed cur­fews, while other Euro­pean na­tions closed schools, can­celled surgery and en­listed stu­dent medics.</p>
    <p>US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump called for a big eco­nomic stim­u­lus as the coun­try’s in­fec­tions sur­passed eight mil­lion, with record spikes in sev­eral states.</p>
    <p>States across the Mid­west are see­ing a rise in coro­n­avirus cases, with new in­fec­tions and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions hit­ting record lev­els.</p>
    <p>In­dia’s cu­mu­la­tive tally of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions stood at 7.43 mil­lion last Satur­day, with the num­ber of ac­tive in­fec­tions slip­ping be­low 800,000 for the first time in 11/ months. 2</p>
    <p>Iran, the Mid­dle East­ern coun­try hard­est hit by the coro­n­avirus, ex­tended re­stric­tions and clo­sures in the cap­i­tal Te­heran into a third week last Satur­day as its death toll rose above 30,000.</p>
    <p>Since the pan­demic started, over 1.1 mil­lion peo­ple have died due to Covid-19, with the global fa­tal­ity rate hov­er­ing around 2.8 per cent of the to­tal cases.</p>
    <p>An of­fi­cial at the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has said that the global death toll from Covid-19 could dou­ble to two mil­lion be­fore a suc­cess­ful vac­cine is widely used, and could be even higher with­out con­certed ac­tion to curb the pan­demic.</p>
