    <p>HANOI • Viet­namese weaver Phan Thi Thuan hitches up her trousers as she wades into a lo­tus paddy to gather the stems needed to make a rare and highly sought-af­ter thread.</p>
    <p>Her great-aunt made and sold tra­di­tional silk to the French dur­ing colo­nial rule, pass­ing the tech­nique on to Ms Thuan, who started weav­ing when she was six in her vil­lage on the out­skirts of Hanoi.</p>
    <p>But three years ago, Ms Thuan spot­ted a new op­por­tu­nity in the lo­tus stems left to rot in nearby fields af­ter the seeds had been har­vested for food.</p>
    <p>She be­gan ex­tract­ing the fi­bre found in the stems to make “lo­tus silk”, an ex­clu­sive fab­ric highly sought by fash­ion de­sign­ers.</p>
    <p>“I was the first in Viet­nam,” the 65-year-old said proudly.</p>
    <p>“I started all by my­self, then I trained those al­ready in my work­shop,” she added.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers of­ten toil for hours to clear lo­tus pad­dies of rot­ting stems, which ruin the soil and bring un­wanted in­sects.</p>
    <p>But thanks to her vi­sion, Ms Thuan to­day leads a team of about 20 mostly fe­male work­ers who snap off the stems in the pad­dies be­fore they tease out the frag­ile fi­bres and roll them into thread.</p>
    <p>Dressed head-to-toe in brown silk and wear­ing a pearl neck­lace – the same out­fit she dons as she picks through the lo­tus pad­dies – Ms Thuan de­scribes her work.</p>
    <p>It is a painstak­ing process – a large scarf re­quires the thread of around 9,200 stems and would take one worker around two months to com­plete – but Ms Thuan in­sists it is worth it.</p>
    <p>“I see this as my task now, to gen­er­ate jobs and to do my bit for the en­vi­ron­ment,” she said, adding that dur­ing busy pe­ri­ods, she em­ploys hun­dreds to weave from home.</p>
    <p>The prof­its are an­other rea­son to per­se­vere.</p>
    <p>While a reg­u­lar silk scarf might go for US$20 (S$27), even a smaller lo­tus ver­sion – pop­u­lar with pre­co­ro­n­avirus tourists – fetches more than 10 times that.</p>
    <p>Al­though lo­tus silk is made in a hand­ful of coun­tries – in­clud­ing Myan­mar and Cam­bo­dia – Ms Thuan is seen as an in­no­va­tor in Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>She has been sup­ported by the Min­istry of Science and Tech­nol­ogy, which kick­started a three-year na­tional-level project to fur­ther de­velop the har­vest­ing tech­nique.</p>
    <p>Ms Thuan also runs train­ing ses­sions dur­ing the school hol­i­days, hop­ing to show chil­dren there is space for dy­namism even in this an­cient pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>Ms Nguyen Thi Xoa, 40, was taught by Ms Thuan in 2017 and she now wants her chil­dren to fol­low in her thread.</p>
    <p>“At the be­gin­ning it was very dif­fi­cult, but now I love do­ing it,” she said. “It’s a sta­ble job and I’m proud of it.”</p>
