    <p>MEL­BOURNE • The leader of the state at the cen­tre of Aus­tralia’s coro­n­avirus out­break said he does not know who in his gov­ern­ment made the de­ci­sion to hire pri­vate se­cu­rity firms to mon­i­tor quar­an­tine pro­ce­dures in Mel­bourne ho­tels that sub­se­quently failed.</p>
    <p>“The de­ci­sion to en­gage pri­vate se­cu­rity con­trac­tors, and many de­ci­sions like it, were of an op­er­a­tional na­ture,” Vic­to­ria Premier Daniel An­drews said in a state­ment to the i nquiry i nto his gov­ern­ment’s ho­tel quar­an­tine scheme.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieved that those di­rectly in­volved in the de­sign and de­liv­ery of the pro­gramme would care­fully con­sider in­fec­tion con­trol pro­to­cols as part of their de­lib­er­a­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews and his Labor gov­ern­ment have been un­der pres­sure over se­cu­rity fail­ures at quar­an­tine ho­tels for re­turned over­seas trav­ellers that led to a resur­gence of com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion in Vic­to­ria.</p>
    <p>The re­newed out­break means state cap­i­tal Mel­bourne will be un­der a strict lock­down and cur­few un­til the end of next month.</p>
    <p>In the state­ment, sub­mit­ted be­fore he ap­peared at the in­quiry for ques­tion­ing yes­ter­day, Mr An­drews said that while he was aware of the fed­eral gov­ern­ment’s of­fer to pro­vide Aus­tralian De­fence Force per­son­nel to help with quar­an­tine mea­sures, “I cer­tainly had no ex­pec­ta­tion that the ADF would have any ex­ten­sive in­volve­ment at that time” in his state’s pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­ol­o­gist Charles Al­pren told the in­quiry last month that at least 90 per cent of the state’s coro­n­avirus cases since May could be linked to the ho­tel breaches. Among a litany of prob­lems, the con­trac­tors failed to use per­sonal pro­tec­tion equip­ment, and some guards had sex with quar­an­tined guests, the Herald Sun news­pa­per re­ported. Ac­cord­ing to the re­port, the virus spread among the guards who car­pooled or shared cig­a­rette lighters.</p>
    <p>They then un­wit­tingly in­tro­duced the virus to their own com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Faced with a surge of cases that reached a daily high of 686 on Aug 4, Mr An­drews locked down Mel­bourne, and then the rest of the state. Fed­eral Trea­surer Josh Fry­den­berg has been par­tic­u­larly scathing of the Premier’s han­dling of the cri­sis, say­ing it was “like watch­ing a car crash”.</p>
    <p>While the num­bers are fall­ing, with 14 new cases recorded yes­ter­day, more progress is needed be­fore the lock­down can be lifted.</p>
    <p>Mr An­drews said that would not hap­pen un­til the rolling 14-day av­er­age of new cases in Mel­bourne falls be­low five. It stood at 25.1 yes­ter­day.</p>
