    <p>NO DOUBT</p>
    <p>With each em­phatic goal, the Lion City Sailors chipped away at the doubts sur­round­ing their Sin­ga­pore Pre­mier League (SPL) ti­tle cre­den­tials, as they thumped Balestier Khalsa 7-1 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>After an in­con­sis­tent run since they made head­lines in Fe­bru­ary by pri­vatis­ing, Aurelio Vid­mar’s men pro­duced a re­sound­ing vic­tory to leapfrog the Tigers and move to sec­ond on goal dif­fer­ence with 11 points from seven matches.</p>
    <p>Cru­cially, they have a game in hand on Tampines Rovers, who lead the stand­ings on 16 points but were left ru­ing their 1-1 draw with 10-man Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional at Our Tampines Hub in yes­ter­day’s other clash.</p>
    <p>There are only 14 rounds of fix­tures in this sea­son’s short­ened SPL due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and the Sailors will un­likely face op­po­nents as agree­able as Marko Kral­je­vic’s side was at the Bis­han Sta­dium.</p>
    <p>With no fans in the grounds, the Croat’s shouts of “too easy” were clearly au­di­ble and his frus­tra­tions were well-founded.</p>
    <p>It took just 10 min­utes for Stipe Plaz­i­bat to head in Shah­dan Su­laiman’s free kick and, by half­time, they were up by five goals. The ex­cel­lent Plaz­i­bat had his hat­trick along­side two as­sists for Song Ui-young and Sai­ful­lah Ak­bar.</p>
    <p>The Tigers de­fence, miss­ing the tow­er­ing pres­ence of cen­tre-back En­sar Brun­sce­vic who was out with a knee in­jury, con­ceded two more after the in­ter­val to Ta­jeli Sala­mat and Adam Swandi with for­ward Kris­ti­jan Kra­jcek’s strike of­fer­ing lit­tle con­so­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Call­ing it a “fan­tas­tic per­for­mance”, Vid­mar said: “I’m ex­tremely pleased... We had many great play­ers tonight.</p>
    <p>“We were play­ing our third game in seven days, and we kept push­ing the in­ten­sity. And it is go­ing to be like this for the rest of the sea­son – play, re­cover and get ready.</p>
    <p>“Even if the re­sults haven’t al­ways gone our way, we have been con­sis­tent with the way we are try­ing to play at­tack­ing foot­ball. If we do our jobs prop­erly, every­thing will come to­gether like they did tonight.”</p>
    <p>The play­ers and of­fi­cials ob­served a minute of si­lence for for­mer Sin­ga­pore in­ter­na­tional Salim Moin, who died on Fri­day night after a heart at­tack. He was 59.</p>
    <p>Salim pre­vi­ously coached the na­tional Un­der-18s and had coach­ing stints at SPL clubs Gom­bak United, Balestier, Wood­lands Wellington, Tampines and Hougang United.</p>
    <p>Plaz­i­bat, a for­mer Hougang striker, paid trib­ute and ded­i­cated his tre­ble to his for­mer as­sis­tant coach. He said: “I was so shocked and sad to hear the news. Coach Salim was a very nice guy who gave good ad­vice on and off the pitch.</p>
    <p>“He had an eye for de­tail and knew when to say the right things to calm down a ner­vous player.”</p>
    <p>As for the ti­tle race, Plaz­i­bat added: “We al­ways felt we are in it. Luck was not on our side when we lost to Al­birex and drew with Hougang, but we al­ways be­lieved we would bounce back.</p>
    <p>“We have good mo­men­tum now to keep push­ing and putting pres­sure on the lead­ers. Ev­ery team will drop points with this sched­ule, but I’m very con­fi­dent our fit­ness help us come through on top.”</p>
    <p>We al­ways felt we are in it. Luck was not on our side when we lost to Al­birex and drew with Hougang, but we al­ways be­lieved we would bounce back.</p>
    <p>STIPE PLAZ­I­BAT, Lion City Sailors’ striker, on how his side’s con­fi­dence never wa­vered.</p>
