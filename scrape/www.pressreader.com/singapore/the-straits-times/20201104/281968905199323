    <p>BANGKOK • Stu­dent Napawn Somsak took to the stage in her school uni­form to de­nounce sex­ism in Thai so­ci­ety and ques­tion the treat­ment of a royal princess – an act un­think­able be­fore the protests that have roiled the coun­try in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>Be­fore a cheer­ing crowd of more than 2,000 peo­ple in the north­ern prov­ince of Chi­ang Mai, the 18-year-old de­manded to know why women are paid less than men and can­not be or­dained into the influentia­l Bud­dhist monk­hood.</p>
    <p>Ms Napawn is among the large num­bers of young Thai women call­ing pub­licly for change, em­bold­ened by wide­spread protests to de­mand the de­par­ture of Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha and re­forms to the pow­er­ful monar­chy.</p>
    <p>“If we be­lieve that ev­ery­one is equal and there is a need to re­form the value of pa­tri­archy in Thai so­ci­ety, then no one, in­clud­ing the monar­chy, should be ex­empted,” she told the Thom­son Reuters Foun­da­tion in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The protests have swept away a long­stand­ing taboo on dis­cussing the royal fam­ily, al­low­ing Ms Napawn to re­fer in her ad­dress to a royal princess stripped of her ti­tles after mar­ry­ing a for­eigner – although she stopped short of nam­ing her.</p>
    <p>Princess Ubol­ratana Ra­jakanya</p>
    <p>Siri­vad­hana Bar­navadi was re­quired to give up the ti­tle Her Royal High­ness after mar­ry­ing an Amer­i­can fel­low stu­dent while study­ing in the United States.</p>
    <p>The Royal Palace and the De­part­ment of Women’s Af­fairs and Fam­ily Developmen­t de­clined to com­ment on the protests, which be­gan as po­lit­i­cal but have ex­panded to cover ev­ery­thing from cor­rup­tion in the mil­i­tary to women’s rights.</p>
    <p>The palace has made no of­fi­cial com­ment on the pro­test­ers, but on Sun­day, King Maha Va­ji­ra­longkorn said “we love them all the same” in his first di­rect public com­ments on months of demon­stra­tions.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers say they do not seek to abol­ish the monar­chy, only re­form it. But the Thai Con­sti­tu­tion says the monar­chy is “en­throned in a po­si­tion of revered wor­ship” and con­ser­va­tives are hor­ri­fied by at­tacks on it.</p>
    <p>Many of the young pro­test­ers are stu­dents who also com­plain of a school sys­tem that em­pha­sises obe­di­ence and tra­di­tion, from lin­ing up daily for the na­tional an­them to strict rules on uni­forms, hair­cuts and be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Dr Ti­tipol Phakdee­wanich, dean of Ubon Ratchathan­i Univer­sity’s Fac­ulty of Po­lit­i­cal Sci­ence, said women faced more sup­pres­sion than men in schools. “The po­lit­i­cal space is open­ing up for young girls, who have long been sup­pressed.”</p>
    <p>At protest sites across the coun­try, peo­ple are be­ing asked to sign pe­ti­tions call­ing for abor­tion and pros­ti­tu­tion to be de­crim­i­nalised.</p>
    <p>Women for Free­dom and Democ­racy, a pres­sure group formed in Au­gust, dis­trib­utes san­i­tary pads and has also de­vel­oped an on­line sys­tem to re­port sex­ual ha­rass­ment. More than 40 cases have been re­ported, and it is pro­vid­ing le­gal ad­vice on some.</p>
    <p>The King was of­fi­cially crowned as con­sti­tu­tional monarch in May last year after first tak­ing the throne fol­low­ing the 2016 death of his widely revered fa­ther, who reigned for 70 years.</p>
    <p>He has been mar­ried four times, and his re­la­tion­ships with women have been the sub­ject of scru­tiny.</p>
    <p>Last year, he stripped his royal con­sort of her ti­tles and mil­i­tary ranks for be­ing “dis­loyal”, only to re­in­state them in Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Thai stu­dent groups have laid out 10 de­mands for change, in­clud­ing re­duc­ing the King’s con­sti­tu­tional pow­ers as well as his per­sonal con­trol of the royal for­tune and of some units of the army.</p>
    <p>Ms Chuma­porn Taengk­liang, who co-founded Women for Free­dom and Democ­racy, wants another de­mand added: im­punity for do­mes­tic or sex­ual vi­o­lence to end.</p>
    <p>“The monar­chy is an im­por­tant role model for the coun­try, and if they have im­punity when it comes to do­mes­tic or sex­ual vi­o­lence, it is not sur­pris­ing that a hus­band or fa­ther has im­punity when they use vi­o­lence among fam­ily mem­bers,” she said.</p>
    <p>“In a so­ci­ety in which peo­ple of all lev­els are op­pressed, women are op­pressed even more. They can’t stand it any more.”</p>
    <p>ALL ARE EQUAL</p>
    <p>If we be­lieve that ev­ery­one is equal and there is a need to re­form the value of pa­tri­archy in Thai so­ci­ety, then no one, in­clud­ing the monar­chy, should be ex­empted.</p>
