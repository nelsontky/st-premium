    <p>• China has re­buffed the lat­est of­fer of talks from Tai­wan, say­ing the govern­ment was en­gag­ing in a “cheap trick” and provo­ca­tion, and not­ing that it has sought con­fronta­tion with Bei­jing at ev­ery turn.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan is ready to have “mean­ing­ful” talks with China as equals as long as it is will­ing to put aside con­fronta­tion, Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing­wen had said in her New Year’s speech on Fri­day, which is seen by some as of­fer­ing another olive branch to Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>China views the self-gov­erned is­land as part of its own ter­ri­tory, and cut off a for­mal talks mech­a­nism in 2016 af­ter Ms Tsai, from the pro-in­de­pen­dence Demo­cratic Pro­gres­sive Party (DPP), was first elected.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the pres­i­den­tial of­fice, Ms Tsai said that in the past year, Chi­nese mil­i­tary ac­tiv­ity near Tai­wan has threat­ened peace and sta­bil­ity in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>“As long as the Bei­jing au­thor­i­ties are de­ter­mined to defuse an­tag­o­nism and im­prove cross-strait re­la­tions, in line with the prin­ci­ples of rec­i­proc­ity and dig­nity, we are will­ing to jointly pro­mote mean­ing­ful dia­logue,” Ms Tsai said, echo­ing com­ments in her na­tional day speech last Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment late on Fri­day, China’s Cabi­net-level Tai­wan Af­fairs Of­fice (TAO) said there was no way of chang­ing the re­al­ity that the is­land was part of China, and the re­fusal of Tai­wan’s govern­ment to ac­cept that was the root cause of present ten­sions.</p>
    <p>Since 2016, Tai­wan’s rul­ing DPP “has con­tin­ued to pro­voke by seek­ing in­de­pen­dence, con­fronting the main­land at ev­ery turn, de­lib­er­ately cre­at­ing con­fronta­tion across the Tai­wan Strait”, the TAO said.</p>
    <p>“They again talked about so­called ‘ dia­logue,’ but where can that come from?” the of­fice said, adding: “We urge the DPP au­thor­i­ties to stop these cheap tricks that dupe peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai, re-elected by a land­slide last year on a pledge to stand up to China and de­fend Tai­wan’s democ­racy and se­cu­rity, has re­peat­edly said Tai­wan is al­ready an in­de­pen­dent coun­try called the Repub­lic of China, its for­mal name.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan now has de facto in­de­pen­dence; for China, re­uni­fi­ca­tion is the ul­ti­mate goal, and by force if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions have risen in re­cent months af­ter two se­nior US of­fi­cials made high-pro­file vis­its to Tai­wan: Health Sec­re­tary Alex Azar in August, and Un­der­sec­re­tary of State Keith Krach in Septem­ber. China has ramped up its mil­i­tary ac­tiv­i­ties near Tai­wan, in­clud­ing on oc­ca­sion fly­ing fighter jets across the me­dian line of the nar­row Tai­wan Strait, which usu­ally serves as an unof­fi­cial buf­fer.</p>
    <p>China has said it is re­spond­ing to “col­lu­sion” be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Taipei, an­gered at grow­ing US sup­port for the is­land. Bei­jing views this as a pre­cur­sor to Tai­wan declar­ing for­mal in­de­pen­dence, a red line for China.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese State Coun­cil­lor and For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi has also re­it­er­ated China’s firm re­solve to safe­guard na­tional in­ter­ests, while stress­ing that the Chi­nese side is obliged to speak up for jus­tice when faced with power politics and bullying.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang clar­i­fied the stance in a re­cent in­ter­view with Xin­hua News Agency and China Me­dia Group on the in­ter­na­tional sit­u­a­tion and China’s diplo­macy last year.</p>
    <p>“We have re­sponded res­o­lutely and ra­tio­nally to un­jus­ti­fied moves by the United States. We have han­dled is­sues re­lat­ing to Tai­wan, Hong Kong, Xin­jiang and Ti­bet with jus­ti­fied, strong and pro­por­tion­ate coun­ter­mea­sures and won one fierce bat­tle af­ter another in in­ter­na­tional or­gan­i­sa­tions, vig­or­ously safe­guard­ing China’s sovereignt­y, dig­nity and de­vel­op­ment in­ter­ests,” he said.</p>
