    <p>The NUS Baba House is a rather over­looked op­tion on the mu­seum scene, partly be­cause one has to do ap­point­ment view­ing. But this also means you get a nice do­cent-led tour of a con­ser­va­tion shop­house which is also a teach­ing tool for the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore stu­dents.</p>
    <p>This is ev­i­dent in the front hall, where a square of blue paint stands out against the oth­er­wise white­washed walls. This, I learn from my tour guide, is a test patch to see how the paint re­acts to mois­ture in the walls.</p>
    <p>Vis­i­tors who have been to Pe­nang’s Blue Man­sion will note that this hue is no­tice­ably lighter than the rich cobalt of the former, but it is true to the orig­i­nal shade the hall was painted in.</p>
    <p>Built around 1895, the house was oc­cu­pied by the Per­anakan-Chi­nese Wee fam­ily and then left un­in­hab­ited for about 20 years un­til the univer­sity bought it in 2006. It has been care­fully doc­u­mented and is still be­ing pro­gres­sively re­stored.</p>
    <p>Some in­trigu­ing things to look out for in­clude a pair of an­ces­tral por­traits of the Wee ma­tri­arch and pa­tri­arch in for­mal Qing dress, which de­noted their (bought) po­si­tions in the court, and a West­ern-style four-poster bed, mounted on cas­tors, in a bed­room up­stairs.</p>
    <p>Pho­tog­ra­pher and print­maker Chris Yap has also in­stalled the lat­est it­er­a­tion of his long-run­ning ex­plo­ration of Per­anakan iden­ti­ties – of Cross-dress­ing & Cul­ture (an ac­tor) – on the third level of the house.</p>
    <p>Draw­ing from the long tra­di­tion of male ac­tors play­ing women in wayang Per­anakan, the dress­ing ta­ble dis­play in­cludes ma­te­rial hand-dyed in bunga telang (but­ter­fly pea flower) usu­ally used in cook­ing, hand­writ­ten notes that in­clude English and Ja­panese, and lines from the tele­vi­sion se­ries The Lit­tle Ny­onya (2008) trans­lated into Baba Malay.</p>
    <p>The work questions an ar­ray of is­sues, rang­ing from gen­der stereo­types to the ap­pro­pri­a­tion of Per­anakan cul­ture in pop cul­ture en­ter­tain­ment. WHERE: 157 Neil Road WHEN: Tues­days to Fri­days, 10am; Satur­days, 1 to 4pm MRT: Ou­tram Park</p>
    <p>AD­MIS­SION: By ap­point­ment only. Groups are lim­ited to five peo­ple INFO: str.sg/J2Dq</p>
