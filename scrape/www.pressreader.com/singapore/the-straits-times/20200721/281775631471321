    <p>SYD­NEY • A surge i n Covid-19 cases in Aus­tralia’s sec­ond-big­gest city could take weeks to sub­side de­spite a lock­down and or­ders to wear masks, Aus­tralia’s act­ing chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer said yes­ter­day as the coun­try braces it­self for a sec­ond wave of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The author­i­ties in the state of Vic­to­ria, whose cap­i­tal Mel­bourne is in par­tial lock­down amid a new out­break, re­ported 275 new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, down from a daily record of 438 three days ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia’s act­ing chief med­i­cal of­fi­cer Paul Kelly said it would take weeks to slow the out­break to lev­els seen as re­cently as last month, when Vic­to­ria and the rest of Aus­tralia re­ported sin­gle or dou­ble-digit daily in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“We have learnt over time that the time between in­tro­duc­ing a mea­sure and see­ing its ef­fect is at least two weeks, and some­times longer than that,” Pro­fes­sor Kelly told Aus­tralian Broad­cast­ing Cor­po­ra­tion ra­dio.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has recorded about 11,800 coro­n­avirus cases with a death toll of 123, a frac­tion of what has been seen in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>In most Aus­tralian states, the dis­ease has been ef­fec­tively elim­i­nated. Less than a month ago, Aus­tralia was widely her­alded as a global leader in com­bat­ing Covid-19, but quar­an­tine lapses in Vic­to­ria trig­gered a flare-up in in­fec­tions last month.</p>
    <p>Hear­ings be­gan yes­ter­day for an of­fi­cial in­quiry into the out­break.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­ria’s gov­ern­ment has or­dered about five mil­lion peo­ple into a par­tial lock­down for six weeks and told res­i­dents around Mel­bourne to cover their faces if they have to leave their homes.</p>
    <p>Vic­to­rian Premier Daniel An­drews said it was too soon to de­clare that such mea­sures had flat­tened the out­break.</p>
    <p>“Un­til we bring some sta­bil­ity to this, we won’t be able to talk about a trend,” he said, re­fer­ring to the drop in daily new cases.</p>
    <p>The Vic­to­rian out­break and ris­ing daily cases in neigh­bour­ing New South Wales, the coun­try’s most-pop­u­lous state, are stok­ing fears of a na­tional sec­ond wave.</p>
    <p>NSW re­ported 20 new in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, the high­est i n three months.</p>
    <p>The trans­mis­sion rate i n the state is higher than in Vic­to­ria, de­spite so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions be­ing tight­ened.</p>
    <p>The NSW author­i­ties have been un­able to trace some of the clus­ters, and the state author­i­ties have urged peo­ple to avoid un­nec­es­sary travel and pub­lic trans­port.</p>
    <p>NSW Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian said she would con­sider tight­en­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing re­stric­tions i n cities such as Syd­ney if the num­bers con­tinue to rise over the next few weeks.</p>
    <p>Should NSW be forced to im­ple­ment new re­stric­tions, it would be a ham­mer blow to Aus­tralia’s hopes for a quick eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia is al­ready fac­ing its first re­ces­sion i n nearly three decades, with un­em­ploy­ment at a 22-year high.</p>
    <p>Deloitte Ac­cess Eco­nomics es­ti­mated that around 240,000 busi­nesses in the hos­pi­tal­ity, pro­fes­sional ser­vices and trans­port in­dus­tries, in par­tic­u­lar, are at high risk of fail­ure af­ter Septem­ber with­out en­dur­ing gov­ern­ment sup­port.</p>
