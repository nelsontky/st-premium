    <p>PETALING JAYA • A surge in the num­ber of prison­ers in­fected with the coro­n­avirus in Jo­hor and Pa­hang has kept up the num­ber of to­tal cases re­ported in Malaysia over the last two days.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry yes­ter­day re­ported 1,870 to­tal new Covid-19 cases, with Jo­hor lead­ing the tally for the first time.</p>
    <p>Jo­hor state recorded 607 new cases, of which 374 – 61.6 per cent – were at­trib­uted to a newly iden­ti­fied clus­ter called Tem­bok Choh, which in­volves a prison. The govern­ment did not say where the prison was lo­cated.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, a sep­a­rate new clus­ter de­tected in a prison in eastern Pa­hang state led to a surge in Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The min­istry’s di­rec­tor-gen­eral, Dr Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah, said on Tues­day that the Tem­bok Mem­paga clus­ter in Pa­hang’s Ben­tong district recorded 282 cases, mak­ing up 98 per cent of the to­tal 288 new cases in the state that day.</p>
    <p>The Pa­hang de­tainee clus­ter started with a per­son in the prison who was di­ag­nosed pos­i­tive on Dec 22. The virus quickly spread to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>The spread of the coro­n­avirus in the Jo­hor and Pa­hang prisons came after other clus­ters formed in prisons and de­ten­tion cen­tres in Malaysia over the last few months, as de­tainees are of­ten placed closely to­gether in cells.</p>
    <p>Clus­ters in­volv­ing lock-ups, im­mi­gra­tion de­ten­tion de­pots and prisons in sev­eral Malaysian states ac­counted for 307, or 16 per cent, of the to­tal 1,925 new cases logged on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the pris­oner and de­tainee clus­ters to­talled 402, or 21.5 per cent, of the 1,870 new cases.</p>
    <p>The wor­ry­ing rise in the num­ber of cases among those be­hind bars has eclipsed that in­volv­ing for­eign work­ers at glove fac­to­ries in the last two months.</p>
    <p>There has also been an in­crease in cases in­volv­ing con­struc­tion sites.</p>
    <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day logged six new fa­tal­i­ties to bring the to­tal num­ber of coro­n­avirus deaths to 463.</p>
    <p>“For now, we are mon­i­tor­ing 220 ac­tive clus­ters and 50 of them saw an in­crease in cases,” Dr Noor Hisham said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, as Covid-19 screen­ing be­came manda­tory for all for­eign work­ers, em­ploy­ers have urged the Malaysian govern­ment to control the ser­vice fee im­posed by clin­ics and hos­pi­tals for tests.</p>
    <p>“Prices have gone up now that it’s manda­tory to test all for­eign work­ers,” said Real Es­tate and Hous­ing De­vel­op­ers’ As­so­ci­a­tion Malaysia pres­i­dent Soam Heng Choon.</p>
    <p>He said the prices of the anti­gen rapid test kit that used to cost be­tween RM50 (S$16) and RM60 sev­eral months ago were now be­tween RM100 and RM120.</p>
