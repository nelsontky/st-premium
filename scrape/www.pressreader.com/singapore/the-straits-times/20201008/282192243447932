    <p>•</p>
    <p>When Aus­tralia’s rul­ing coali­tion first at­tempted to de­liver a post-pan­demic eco­nomic up­date in July, the fig­ures be­came ob­so­lete within days as the state of Vic­to­ria suf­fered a sec­ond wave of Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ence demon­strated the enor­mous difficulty of plan­ning ahead in the midst of an un­pre­dictable global health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>This week, Aus­tralia’s coali­tion has again been forced to look ahead as it de­liv­ered its first bud­get since the out­break. The bud­get, un­veiled on Tues­day, was pri­mar­ily de­signed to boost business and con­sumer con­fi­dence and to per­suade the pub­lic that the coali­tion has a plan to re­cover from the na­tion’s first re­ces­sion in more than 28 years.</p>
    <p>The plan, as out­lined in the bud­get, is to take on mas­sive debt to en­able lav­ish spend­ing on tax cuts, in­cen­tives to pro­mote business in­vest­ment, and sup­port hir­ing of peo­ple aged 16 to 35.</p>
    <p>But much of the re­ac­tion to the bud­get was not fo­cused on its gen­er­ous hand­outs or its spec­tac­u­lar debt lev­els, which are due to peak at a record A$966 bil­lion (S$937.7 bil­lion) in 2024. In­stead, many of the ques­tions fo­cused on the bud­get’s as­sump­tions and on how long they will re­main in­tact.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment is bank­ing on: no fur­ther sec­ond waves, a vac­cine be­ing rolled out from July 1 and avail­able na­tion­wide by late next year, a grad­ual re­turn of in­ter­na­tional stu­dents and mi­grants next year, and in­ter­na­tional travel grad­u­ally re­sum­ing from the end of next year. It also as­sumes that debt will re­main cheap and easy to ac­cess, and that much of the world will en­joy a V-shaped eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Economists and pub­lic health ex­perts have pointed out that some of these as­sump­tions are overly op­ti­mistic, and po­ten­tially shaky.</p>
    <p>The pres­i­dent of the Aus­tralian Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion, Dr Omar</p>
    <p>Khor­shid, said the prospect of a safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cine be­ing avail­able by the mid­dle of next year was “very un­likely”. “The most likely out­come is that the vac­cine is par­tially ef­fec­tive, lim­ited in the num­ber of peo­ple who de­velop a re­sponse or it’s only ef­fec­tive for a short du­ra­tion,” he told ABC News.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers pointed out the risks in the gov­ern­ment’s as­sump­tion that fur­ther Covid-19 out­breaks will be lo­calised.</p>
    <p>In­deed, hours af­ter the bud­get was re­leased, the New South Wales gov­ern­ment re­vealed yes­ter­day that a 12-day run with­out any com­mu­nity trans­mis­sions had ended af­ter the au­thor­i­ties de­tected three mys­te­ri­ous lo­cally ac­quired cases. The cases are un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion, but fur­ther cases in the state could end plans to re­open the bor­der with Queens­land state, which would fur­ther set back plans to boost do­mes­tic tourism.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the health-based as­sump­tions, economists ques­tioned some of the fi­nan­cial un­der­pin­nings of the bud­get.</p>
    <p>An econ­o­mist and for­mer coali­tion leader, Dr John Hew­son, now at the Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity, said yes­ter­day that Aus­tralia and other coun­tries were fail­ing to ap­pre­ci­ate the risk of a debt cri­sis. “It is an in­her­ent weak­ness of global Covid-19 eco­nomic strate­gies to ig­nore pos­si­ble longer-term con­se­quences of mas­sive mon­e­tary ex­pan­sions by cen­tral banks… and fis­cal ex­pan­sions by gov­ern­ments,” he wrote in The Syd­ney Morn­ing Her­ald. “The pos­si­bil­ity of a pan­demic-in­duced sys­temic debt cri­sis can­not be ruled out.”</p>
    <p>Be­yond crit­i­cisms of the gov­ern­ment’s bud­get as­sump­tions, there was praise for the coali­tion, which has pre­vi­ously tended to es­chew debt, for its will­ing­ness to run up size­able deficits for the fore­see­able fu­ture to try to re­store the econ­omy to health. Most com­men­ta­tors backed the de­ci­sion to in­cur heavy debt.</p>
    <p>“This is one of the most stim­u­la­tory bud­gets we have ever seen,” said an analysis by Na­tional Aus­tralia Bank’s chief econ­o­mist Alan Oster. But he noted that the bud­get’s fore­casts for the pan­demic’s hits to gross do­mes­tic prod­uct and un­em­ploy­ment were “op­ti­mistic”.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment be­lieves that re­build­ing the econ­omy de­pends on restor­ing pub­lic con­fi­dence about the na­tion’s fu­ture. But, to in­stil hope, Aus­tralia’s lead­ers will first need to per­suade the pub­lic that their cur­rent out­look is plau­si­ble, and not wish­ful think­ing.</p>
