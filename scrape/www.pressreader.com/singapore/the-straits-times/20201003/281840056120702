    <p>As the pan­demic be­gan to spread rapidly in the early part of the year, so did mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Such was its tempo that it kept fact check­ers on their toes, ac­cord­ing to a re­port by lead­ing factcheck­ing or­gan­i­sa­tion First Draft that ex­am­ined fact-check­ing ef­forts be­tween Jan­uary and June.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent fig­ures, such as in­fec­tious dis­eases ex­pert An­thony Fauci and phi­lan­thropist Bill Gates, be­came tar­gets of mis­in­for­ma­tion on­line. Claims that well-known peo­ple like United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump had con­tracted Covid-19 gained trac­tion.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus cri­sis, of an un­prece­dented scale, re­mains a ma­jor chal­lenge to the fact-check­ing in­dus­try and the job is far from done, First Draft cau­tioned.</p>
    <p>New chal­lenges will emerge with the sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions and the roll-out of vac­cines, and new strands of mis­in­for­ma­tion will re­quire a ro­bust re­sponse, said First Draft in a re­port pub­lished by lead­ing jour­nal­ism web­site Nie­man Lab, a part of the Nie­man Foun­da­tion at Har­vard Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>“This is a moment to look back in or­der to pre­pare for what’s ahead,” it said.</p>
    <p>First Draft’s re­port is the lat­est in a se­ries of sim­i­lar stud­ies draw­ing at­ten­tion to the is­sue of in­ac­cu­rate in­for­ma­tion that has been surg­ing dur­ing the months of Covid-19, of­ten in tan­dem with the num­ber of cases.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions and the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion is­sued a joint state­ment at the UN Gen­eral Assem­bly last month draw­ing at­ten­tion to the “in­fo­demic” and urg­ing pol­i­cy­mak­ers, gov­ern­ments and oth­ers to step up mea­sures to counter its spread.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can Jour­nal Of Trop­i­cal Medicine And Hy­giene, in a re­cent re­port, said that ru­mours, con­spir­acy the­o­ries and mis­in­for­ma­tion abounded in In­dia, the US, China, Spain, In­done­sia, and Brazil – coun­tries that had se­vere out­breaks of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>It noted with con­cern the dan­gers of the is­sue, point­ing out, for in­stance, that mis­in­for­ma­tion re­lat­ing to the con­sump­tion of highly con­cen­trated al­co­hol as a way to kill the virus had re­sulted in deaths, thou­sands of peo­ple get­ting hos­pi­talised and some 60 peo­ple go­ing blind.</p>
    <p>First Draft said: “The out­put of fact-check­ing or­gan­i­sa­tions rose rapidly at the end of Jan­uary as news of the out­break in Wuhan be­gan to emerge and the prospect of it spread­ing glob­ally grew.”</p>
    <p>It added: “Or­gan­i­sa­tions fur­ther ramped up their cov­er­age as we headed into March, as cases be­gan ris­ing around the world and gov­ern­ments be­gan tak­ing ac­tion to stop the virus’ spread.”</p>
    <p>First Draft an­a­lysed 9,722 fact checks and found that so­cial me­dia was awash with spec­u­la­tion about the ori­gins of the virus in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>There were sev­eral con­spir­acy the­o­ries too, such as base­less claims that the virus was cre­ated in a lab as part of a bioweapons pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The months of Fe­bru­ary, as well as March, saw a “tor­rent of false claims about home reme­dies, self­di­ag­nos­tics, ef­fects, and signs of the dis­ease”, said First Draft.</p>
    <p>Mis­in­for­ma­tion about false cures and treat­ments spread quickly, as did con­cerns about food short­ages, ex­ac­er­bated by old pic­tures of empty su­per­mar­ket shelves that led to panic buy­ing.</p>
    <p>In March, false claims and base­less ac­cu­sa­tions that cer­tain com­mu­ni­ties were spread­ing the virus, whether in­ten­tion­ally or not, cir­cu­lated widely, said First Draft.</p>
    <p>There was also a sharp in­crease in mis­in­for­ma­tion about pub­lic au­thor­i­ties when gov­ern­ments in­tro­duced lock­downs and so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Mis­in­for­ma­tion spread across bor­ders. In April, there was more de­bunk­ing of false claims about com­mu­nity spread of the dis­ease and its im­pact than any other cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>As pub­lic fig­ures like Dr Fauci and Mr Gates be­came tar­gets of mis­in­for­ma­tion, there were ar­ti­cles claim­ing that they were prof­it­ing from the pan­demic or were part of larger con­spir­acy the­o­ries.</p>
    <p>Ne­ti­zens pointed to records of fund­ing for re­search projects as proof of vested in­ter­ests, said First Draft.</p>
    <p>With sev­eral politi­cians and celebri­ties catch­ing the virus, fact check­ers had to de­bunk sev­eral re­ports about politi­cians and other pub­lic fig­ures break­ing lock­down mea­sures.</p>
