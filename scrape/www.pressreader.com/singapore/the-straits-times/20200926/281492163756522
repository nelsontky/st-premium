    <p>Since De­cem­ber, more than 32 mil­lion peo­ple have been in­fected with Covid-19 as the coro­n­avirus con­tin­ues its reign of ter­ror. Deaths are ex­pected to reach one mil­lion this weekend, based on fig­ures from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity. The real num­bers, how­ever, are likely much higher be­cause of gaps in test­ing and re­port­ing.</p>
    <p>A mil­lion lives lost. A mil­lion sto­ries of tragedy.</p>
    <p>Since De­cem­ber, when Covid-19 first sur­faced in Wuhan, China, over 32 mil­lion peo­ple have been in­fected, and the coro­n­avirus con­tin­ues its reign of ter­ror around the globe.</p>
    <p>Deaths are ex­pected to reach one mil­lion this weekend, based on fig­ures from Johns Hop­kins Univer­sity, which has been col­lect­ing global coro­n­avirus data since the be­gin­ning of the out­break. The real num­bers, how­ever, are likely much higher be­cause of gaps in test­ing and re­port­ing.</p>
    <p>In­stead of im­prov­ing, the sit­u­a­tion has wors­ened in many places, with cases and deaths ac­cel­er­at­ing and coun­tries bat­tling re­peated waves of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>The pace is re­lent­less. In the time taken to read the first few sen­tences of this re­port, one more per­son has lost his fight against the virus.</p>
    <p>The world’s worst-hit coun­tries – the United States, Brazil, In­dia and Mex­ico – ac­count for more than half of the Covid-19 deaths glob­ally, with one in five oc­cur­ring in the US.</p>
    <p>The re­main­der are spread over about 190 other coun­tries and ter­ri­to­ries.</p>
    <p>In­dia now con­sis­tently re­ports the world’s high­est daily tally of in­fec­tions, as over­stretched health ser­vices strug­gle to con­trol the pan­demic. With over 5.8 mil­lion in­fec­tions, it is sec­ond only to the US, which has about seven mil­lion</p>
    <p>cases. In con­trast, China – once the Covid-19 epi­cen­tre – has largely brought the spread of the virus un­der con­trol with strict lock­downs, ag­gres­sive con­tact trac­ing and close mon­i­tor­ing of neigh­bour­hoods, among other mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Among South-east Asian coun­tries, In­done­sia and the Philip­pines have been hard­est hit.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has man­aged to min­imise lives lost, and keep hos­pi­tals free to treat the most se­ri­ous cases through strin­gent mea­sures across gov­ern­ment and so­ci­ety – rang­ing from quar­an­tine of at-risk in­di­vid­u­als to manda­tory mask-wear­ing – and is grad­u­ally re­open­ing the econ­omy amid low com­mu­nity in­fec­tion fig­ures.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the coun­try’s Covid-19 death toll stood at 27, with over 57,000 in­fec­tions, the bulk of which have been among mi­grant work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>As the world mourns a mil­lion deaths from t he virus, The Straits Times, with its net­work of cor­re­spon­dents, has put to­gether a spe­cial re­port high­light­ing the faces of the pan­demic in the re­gion and be­yond. From pa­tients and their loved ones to those on the front lines, each has a tale of an­guish and de­spair, but also of ac­cep­tance and hope.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, which has seen more than 10,000 deaths – the high­est num­ber in South-east Asia – gravedig­ger Adang Sa­pu­tra’s work is un­end­ing, as he some­times buries more than 30 peo­ple a day who have died from the dis­ease. But he be­lieves the victims have a spe­cial place in heaven.</p>
    <p>Mr Judd de Leon was one of about 300,000 cases i n the Philip­pines, which now has the re­gion’s high­est recorded cases. The 40-year-old was at death’s door, and has yet to re­cover fully. Though he emerged from his hos­pi­tal stay poorer, he cel­e­brates sim­ply be­ing alive.</p>
    <p>And for a fam­ily in Sin­ga­pore where the in­fec­tion hit three gen­er­a­tions – grand­mother, mother and daugh­ter – the ex­pe­ri­ence has brought them closer.</p>
    <p>The fastest route to end­ing the pan­demic and ac­cel­er­at­ing global eco­nomic re­cov­ery is to en­sure that some peo­ple are vac­ci­nated in all coun­tries, rather than all peo­ple in some coun­tries, says the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>Al­most 200 pos­si­ble vac­cines are be­ing tested in the race to find one that is safe and ef­fec­tive. The aim is to have two bil­lion doses avail­able by the end of next year un­der a global scheme for their fair dis­tri­bu­tion.</p>
    <p>But un­til vac­cines are ap­proved and made widely avail­able, mea­sures such as test­ing, so­cial dis­tanc­ing and mask-wear­ing must be the new nor­mal amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>WHO di­rec­tor-gen­eral Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu­s has called on all coun­tries to use every tool at their dis­posal to sup­press trans­mis­sion and save lives, un­til and af­ter a vac­cine ar­rives.</p>
    <p>“We must move heaven and earth to en­sure eq­ui­table ac­cess to di­ag­nos­tics, ther­a­peu­tics and vac­cines,” he said at a press con­fer­ence this week. “We sink or we swim to­gether,” he said. “For the world to re­cover faster then it has to re­cover to­gether.”</p>
    <p>We must move heaven and earth to en­sure eq­ui­table ac­cess to di­ag­nos­tics, ther­a­peu­tics and vac­cines... We sink or we swim to­gether... For the world to re­cover faster then it has to re­cover to­gether.</p>
