    <p>Look no fur­ther than emerg­ing mar­kets if you need ev­i­dence that the K-shaped re­cov­ery is tak­ing hold. Stocks and cur­ren­cies from wealth­ier de­vel­op­ing na­tions are out­per­form­ing their poorer peers amid the coro­n­avirus out­break, mag­ni­fy­ing the gap be­tween the “haves” and “have-nots” of the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The gulf may even get wider if the pan­demic leads to deeper re­ces­sions in less wealthy na­tions due to their lower ca­pac­ity for con­tain­ing the virus.</p>
    <p>A Bloomberg study of 17 emerg­ing mar­kets has found a 42 per cent cor­re­la­tion be­tween per capita gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) and stock per­for­mance since the virus­fu­elled risk sell-off be­gan on Jan 20 un­til early last week. The cor­re­la­tion be­tween per capita GDP and cur­rency re­turns was 31 per cent.</p>
    <p>As long as the virus is around, the K-shaped di­ver­gence will con­tinue, said Mr Rob Subbaraman, global head of macro re­search at No­mura Hold­ings in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“In the world with rapidly ris­ing debt and deep re­ces­sions, the cost of ser­vic­ing debt is go­ing to get more bur­den­some and we can­not rule out some fi­nan­cial crises or ma­jor debt re­struc­tur­ing,” he said.</p>
    <p>Wealth­ier emerg­ing mar­kets have been bet­ter placed to re­bound from the March sell-off due to more ad­vanced tech­nol­ogy and gov­er­nance that have given them greater flex­i­bil­ity to re­spond to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They have been able to limit the impact of lock­downs and social dis­tanc­ing, make larger fis­cal re­sponses, and are also bet­ter equipped with the re­sources needed to curb the out­break, such as hos­pi­tals, test cen­tres and quar­an­tine fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries such as South Korea and Poland have seen the small­est in­crease in eco­nomic dis­rup­tions, ac­cord­ing to an ef­fec­tive lock­down in­dex com­piled by Gold­man Sachs.</p>
    <p>The gauge takes into ac­count a com­bi­na­tion of gov­ern­ment re­stric­tions that sup­press ac­tiv­ity and adds social dis­tanc­ing num­bers based on Google mo­bil­ity data.</p>
    <p>There has been a neg­a­tive cor­re­la­tion of 54 per cent be­tween Gold­man’s gauges and per capita GDP. In turn, coun­tries with the low­est lock­down in­dex have tended to see the best stock mar­ket and cur­rency per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>GROW­ING BUR­DEN WIDEST DIVIDE IN ASIA</p>
    <p>The rich-poor divide among emerg­ing mar­kets is widest in Asia. The stock re­turns from the four economies with per capita GDP above US$10,000 (S$13,700) last year – China, South Korea, Tai­wan and Malaysia – have been 20 per cent above that of the na­tions which fall be­low that level, in­clud­ing In­dia, In­done­sia, the Philip­pines and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>This is partly be­cause of the num­ber of tech­nol­ogy firms listed in the for­mer coun­tries, and also due to the fact that their au­thor­i­ties have been able to spend more to re­as­sure cit­i­zens and in­vestors.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s fis­cal re­sponse to the pan­demic, in­clud­ing three sup­ple­men­tary bud­gets, to­tals 270 tril­lion won (S$312 bil­lion), or about 14 per cent of GDP, pro­vid­ing sup­port to the stock mar­ket even as the lo­cal out­break has wors­ened.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the Philip­pine gov­ern­ment has said it is un­able to fund the 1.3 tril­lion peso (S$37 bil­lion) stim­u­lus pack­age ap­proved in June. The na­tion’s stock mar­ket is the re­gion’s worst per­former this year, los­ing more than 25 per cent.</p>
    <p>Look­ing ahead, lower rates of virus in­fec­tion, greater pol­icy space and stronger health ser­vices may help more af­flu­ent coun­tries main­tain their lead in the eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>Richer emerg­ing economies are likely to gain ac­cess to ef­fec­tive coro­n­avirus vac­cines sooner, fol­low­ing the steps of wealthy de­vel­oped na­tions. There is even a risk big­ger economies will mo­nop­o­lise sup­ply, a sce­nario that played out in the 2009 swine flu pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Not many emerg­ing mar­kets have ac­cess to cut­ting-edge tech­nol­ogy, and they will con­tinue to strug­gle,” said Mr Tsu­tomu Soma, a bond trader at Monex in Tokyo.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to see the di­ver­gence in de­vel­oped and emerg­ing mar­kets go­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>In the world with rapidly ris­ing debt and deep re­ces­sions, the cost of ser­vic­ing debt is go­ing to get more bur­den­some and we can­not rule out some fi­nan­cial crises or ma­jor debt re­struc­tur­ing.</p>
