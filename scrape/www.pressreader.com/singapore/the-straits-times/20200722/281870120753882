    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Vot­ers in the cru­cial bat­tle­ground states of Michi­gan, Penn­syl­va­nia and North Carolina will be­gin cast­ing bal­lots for the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Septem­ber, giv­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and his ri­val Joe Bi­den just weeks to ar­gue their cases.</p>
    <p>The first ab­sen­tee bal­lots will be sent out in North Carolina start­ing on Sept 4. Vot­ers in Penn­syl­va­nia will be able to re­quest, fill in and turn in ab­sen­tee bal­lots in per­son start­ing on Sept 14, fol­lowed by vot­ers in Michi­gan on Sept 19.</p>
    <p>That could spell trou­ble for Mr Trump, who is be­hind the Demo­cratic nom­i­nee in na­tional polls as well as the most re­cent polls in all three states.</p>
    <p>Mr Lon John­son, former chair of the Michi­gan Demo­cratic Party, said early vot­ing would force Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den to make their “closing ar­gu­ments” much sooner than in pre­vi­ous years.</p>
    <p>“In the past, cam­paigns had a three-week win­dow be­fore the elec­tion where it was crunch time,” he said. “That win­dow has ex­panded sig­nif­i­cantly.”</p>
    <p>In 2016, more than 47 mil­lion vot­ers cast their bal­lots be­fore elec­tion day, either in per­son or by mail, ac­cord­ing to an ac­count­ing by Dr Michael McDon­ald of the Univer­sity of Florida.</p>
    <p>Elec­tion ad­min­is­tra­tors are en­cour­ag­ing vot­ing even ear­lier this year to avoid prob­lems at the polls and to en­sure their votes are counted dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Early vot­ing is def­i­nitely a part of the so­lu­tion to Covid-19,” said Mr Don Palmer, a Trump-ap­pointed mem­ber of the US Elec­tion As­sis­tance Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“If you’re go­ing to vote ab­sen­tee or mail, it is al­ways good from my per­spec­tive to start early, and make that re­quest, be­cause of­ten you’ll have a process where you are deal­ing with the bu­reau­cra­cies of the post of­fice or the elec­tion of­fice.”</p>
    <p>Early vot­ing has also com­pressed the elec­tion cal­en­dar. North Carolina will be­gin mail­ing bal­lots out just eight days af­ter the Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion ends late next month, while vot­ers in all three states will be able to cast a bal­lot be­fore the first pres­i­den­tial de­bate on Sept 29.</p>
