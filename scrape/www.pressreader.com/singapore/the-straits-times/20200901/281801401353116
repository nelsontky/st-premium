    <p>NEW DELHI • Mr Pranab Mukher­jee, a for­mer In­dian fi­nance min­is­ter who rose to be­come the na­tion’s pres­i­dent, has died. He was 84.</p>
    <p>Mr Mukher­jee died yes­ter­day at a hos­pi­tal in New Delhi where he was be­ing treated for a lung in­fec­tion. His son made the an­nounce­ment via a tweet.</p>
    <p>The vet­eran politi­cian was also found to have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, mak­ing him the first high-pro­file fig­ure in the coun­try to have died af­ter be­ing in­fected.</p>
    <p>Mr Mukher­jee, of­ten called Pranab-da – a suf­fix added to a name to de­note “elder brother” in Ben­gali, was born in Mi­rati vil­lage on Dec 11, 1935, un­der the then Ben­gal Pres­i­dency in Bri­tish In­dia.</p>
    <p>He earned a de­gree in law, and also pur­sued master’s de­grees in his­tory and po­lit­i­cal science. He was a teacher and a jour­nal­ist be­fore en­ter­ing pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>He was nom­i­nated to In­dia’s Up­per House of Par­lia­ment in 1969 by the Congress party, for which he served as a key troublesho­oter.</p>
    <p>A close aide of for­mer prime min­is­ter Indira Gandhi, Mr Mukher­jee had stints as a fed­eral min­is­ter of fi­nance, de­fence, trade and ex­ter­nal af­fairs, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>In July 2012, Mr Mukher­jee was elected as head of the world’s most­pop­u­lous democ­racy, although the role of In­dia’s pres­i­dent is largely cer­e­mo­nial.</p>
    <p>His lead­er­ship in steer­ing In­dia’s econ­omy in the af­ter­math of the 2008 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis is well ac­claimed, but he will be most re­mem­bered for his tax move in 2012 as fi­nance min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Mr Mukher­jee in­tro­duced a ret­ro­spec­tive tax af­ter In­dia’s in­come tax of­fice lost a case de­mand­ing that Voda­fone Group pay cap­i­tal gains le­vies for its 2007 ac­qui­si­tion of the then Hutchi­son Wham­poa’s</p>
    <p>In­dian op­er­a­tions, spook­ing global in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The move was aimed at shor­ing up govern­ment cof­fers af­ter an eco­nomic slow­down had sapped tax rev­enues, leav­ing the econ­omy with a yawn­ing bud­get deficit – then the widest among the big­gest emerg­ing mar­kets.</p>
    <p>“The amend­ment be­came ap­pli­ca­ble not only to Voda­fone, but also a num­ber of other cases in the pipe­line and led to the re­open­ing” of sev­eral tax cases, Mr Mon­tek Singh Ah­luwalia, a for­mer sec­re­tary in the fi­nance min­istry, wrote in his book Back­stage: The Story Be­hind In­dia’s High Growth Years.</p>
    <p>As min­is­ter for ex­ter­nal af­fairs, Mr Mukher­jee signed a deal with then United States Sec­re­tary of State Con­doleezza Rice in 2008 that al­lowed any coun­try ac­cess to nu­clear trade with In­dia de­spite the na­tion not be­ing a sig­na­tory to the Non-Pro­lif­er­a­tion Treaty.</p>
    <p>Last year, Mr Mukher­jee was awarded the Bharat Ratna, In­dia’s top civil­ian hon­our.</p>
