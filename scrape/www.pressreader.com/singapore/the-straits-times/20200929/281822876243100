    <p>NEW DELHI • When eight-year-old In­dian climate change ac­tivist Li­cypriya Kan­gu­jam is older, she wants to launch a solo mis­sion to the moon to re­search ways to save planet earth.</p>
    <p>One of the world’s youngest climate change ac­tivists, Li­cypriya was in­flu­enced by the im­ages of the dev­as­ta­tion caused by the Nepal earthquake­s i n 2015 that killed some 9,000 peo­ple and de­stroyed one mil­lion homes.</p>
    <p>As a four-year-old, she helped her fa­ther raise funds and gather re­lief sup­plies for the mil­lions of peo­ple dis­placed by the tragedy.</p>
    <p>Now she is lead­ing a youth move­ment call­ing for Prime Min­is­ter</p>
    <p>Naren­dra Modi and In­dian law­mak­ers to pass a new law aimed at cap­ping car­bon emis­sions in the world’s third-largest pro­ducer of green­house gases.</p>
    <p>“I am fight­ing to save our planet and our fu­ture,” she said as she protested out­side Par­lia­ment House in New Delhi last Wed­nes­day, clutch­ing a plac­ard that read: “Child move­ment for climate, pass the climate change law.”</p>
    <p>Delhi, a sprawl­ing me­trop­o­lis of some 19 mil­lion peo­ple, is one of the world’s most pol­luted cities and dur­ing the win­ter months toxic haze of­ten keeps fam­i­lies at home.</p>
    <p>Li­cypriya, born in In­dia’s north­east­ern state of Ma­nipur which is</p>
    <p>home to pris­tine moun­tains and crys­tal clear air, is out­raged by the air qual­ity she has seen in Delhi.</p>
    <p>“I am wor­ried about the health of the school chil­dren and small, small ba­bies,” she said from her high-rise apart­ment in Noida, a satel­lite town of New Delhi.</p>
    <p>Just a week shy of her ninth birth­day, her home is tes­ta­ment to both her ac­tivism and her youth. Awards and tro­phies from in­ter­na­tional agen­cies fill a cab­i­net, while she and her six-year-old sis­ter Irina have pil­low fights, sing karaoke, dance and watch films like Frozen.</p>
    <p>Li­cypriya’s ul­ti­mate am­bi­tion is to be­come a “space sci­en­tist” in a bid to save hu­mans back on earth.</p>
    <p>“I will go to the moon and I will re­search how we can get the fresh air to breathe, and how we can get wa­ter, fresh wa­ter to drink, and food, how to grow the crops,” she said. “Be­cause our planet is dy­ing soon.”</p>
