    <p>Tay­lor Swift clar­i­fied she does not have an­other sur­prise al­bum up her sleeve af­ter ru­mours of a pos­si­ble third record cir­cu­lated among her fans.</p>
    <p>The award-win­ning singer ad­dressed the spec­u­la­tions while ap­pear­ing on Jimmy Kim­mel Live on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Host Kim­mel noted that her sup­port­ers be­gan to spec­u­late about a third record called Wood­vale af­ter find­ing the word on the cover of her sur­prise eighth al­bum, Folklore.</p>
    <p>While Swift ad­mits she likes to drop hints for her fans, she said that the word was not one of them.</p>
    <p>“When I was mak­ing Folklore, the al­bum that came out back in July, I was too afraid to un­veil the ti­tle of the al­bum to even my clos­est team­mates and man­age­ment. I didn’t tell any­body the al­bum ti­tle un­til right be­fore it came out.”</p>
    <p>She then used Wood­vale as a fake code name for the record since it had the same num­ber of let­ters as Folklore.</p>
    <p>“I wanted to see how it would look on the al­bum cov­ers, mocked them up and then de­cided, I don’t ac­tu­ally want to have a ti­tle on the al­bum cov­ers and we for­got to take the fake code name off of one of them,” she added.</p>
    <p>Kim­mel then j oked about an­other po­ten­tial al­bum, but Swift quipped: “Jimmy, I’m so tired. I’m so ex­hausted. I’ve tired my­self out. I have noth­ing left.”</p>
