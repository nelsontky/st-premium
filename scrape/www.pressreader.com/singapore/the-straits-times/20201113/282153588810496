    <p>Sin­ga­pore has moved one place up to rank ninth in this year’s list of the most com­pet­i­tive places for ta­lent in the world, ac­cord­ing to a re­port out yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But Sin­ga­pore’s rank­ing in the fu­ture may be af­fected by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, like many other coun­tries that rely on for­eign ta­lent such as the United States, Aus­tralia and Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is the only Asian coun­try to make it to the top 10 in the lat­est rank­ing, which saw Switzer­land at No. 1, fol­lowed by Den­mark and Lux­em­bourg.</p>
    <p>The re­port and rank­ing, re­leased by Swiss busi­ness school In­sti­tute for Man­age­ment De­vel­op­ment (IMD), eval­u­ate the de­vel­op­ment, at­trac­tion and re­ten­tion of hu­man cap­i­tal in 63 economies.</p>
    <p>It looks at mea­sures such as the re­sources ear­marked to cul­ti­vate a home-grown work­force, the ex­tent to which an econ­omy at­tracts for­eign ta­lent and re­tains lo­cal ta­lent, and the qual­ity of the skills and com­pe­ten­cies that are avail­able in a coun­try’s ta­lent pool.</p>
    <p>Eight out of the top 10 economies are Euro­pean, and this is down to qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion and good mo­bil­ity, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>“Over­all, coun­tries in Western Europe re­main, on av­er­age, the most ta­lent-com­pet­i­tive i n the world... But be­cause of their age­ing pop­u­la­tions, these economies need to re­main open and at­trac­tive to a young, in­ter­na­tional, highly skilled work­force in or­der to offset fu­ture labour short­ages,” the IMD World Com­pet­i­tive­ness Cen­tre said in a news re­lease.</p>
    <p>It said the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion had been rel­a­tively sta­ble in the last few years, with im­prove­ments in Sin­ga­pore and the Philip­pines and small de­clines in Malaysia, Thai­land and In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Al­though Asia-Pa­cific coun­tries reg­is­tered a slow in­crease in fe­male par­tic­i­pa­tion in the labour force over the last few years, the re­port said they still per­formed poorly rel­a­tive to other economies.</p>
    <p>This year, Sin­ga­pore has im­proved in in­vest­ment and de­vel­op­ment, with ad­vances in in­di­ca­tors such as ap­pren­tice­ship pro­gramme im­ple­men­ta­tion, em­ployee train­ing, qual­ity of ed­u­ca­tion and fe­male par­tic­i­pa­tion in the work­force, the re­port noted.</p>
    <p>It also re­mains at the top of the rank­ing in readi­ness, with its avail­abil­ity of skilled labour and fi­nance skills.</p>
    <p>But its age­ing pop­u­la­tion, high cost of liv­ing and pol­lu­tion may be fu­ture chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s place could also be af­fected by the pan­demic, which could se­verely hit those coun­tries that base their over­all com­pet­i­tive­ness on the ta­lent econ­omy as a large part of this is from at­tract­ing ta­lent from abroad, the cen­tre said.</p>
    <p>Among them are Sin­ga­pore, Aus­tralia, the US and Bri­tain, all of which have a long his­tory of wel­com­ing for­eign stu­dents who may then join the work­force.</p>
    <p>“These coun­tries can­not be sure to lure in the best work­ers for the time be­ing and may well look into other ways to be com­pet­i­tive. There is a risk that they will de­cide to turn in­wards in their ef­forts to re­vi­talise their economies, back­track­ing in their open­ness, which will do noth­ing to at­tract for­eign ta­lent nor re­tain lo­cal ta­lent,” said Mr Chris­tos Cabolis, chief economist at the cen­tre.</p>
    <p>But he added that for Sin­ga­pore, travel re­stric­tions now should not sub­stan­tially im­pact its ap­peal to highly skilled for­eign pro­fes­sion­als in the short term, es­pe­cially if a vac­cine also be­comes avail­able next year.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, a last­ing ef­fect of the pan­demic in the medium to long term could be a more open ap­proach of com­pa­nies to­wards work­ing from home or re­motely, there­fore de­creas­ing the need for staff to move abroad,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore should keep im­prov­ing in the ar­eas that have proven to be ap­peal­ing to for­eign ta­lent, such as pro­vid­ing a su­pe­rior qual­ity of life, ful­fill­ing pro­fes­sional op­por­tu­ni­ties, a safe en­vi­ron­ment with low crim­i­nal­ity rates, good en­vi­ron­men­tal con­di­tions (low level of pol­lu­tion) and at­trac­tive salaries.”</p>
