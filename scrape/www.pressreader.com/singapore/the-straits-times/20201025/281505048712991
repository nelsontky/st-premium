    <p>Mr Lau Jia Cai has some fas­ci­nat­ing sto­ries about food wastage.</p>
    <p>He once met a poul­try sup­plier who was throw­ing away about seven tonnes of chicken a day.</p>
    <p>“Partly be­cause the chick­ens are not the right size,” the 28-year-old says. “Many of their cus­tomers from the food and bev­er­age (F&B) in­dus­try want chick­ens of a cer­tain size, say 1.3kg.</p>
    <p>“When the sup­plier can’t find the right buy­ers be­cause the birds are too big or too small, they chuck them aside. And when they can no longer sell them, they just throw them away.”</p>
    <p>The level of food wastage, he con­tin­ues, is “in­sane”, es­pe­cially in busi­ness-to-busi­ness (B2B) trans­ac­tions. In­deed, statis­tics by the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency show that Sin­ga­pore­ans wasted 744 mil­lion kg of food last year.</p>
    <p>This dis­mal state of af­fairs prompted Mr Lau and two for­mer class­mates from Pres­by­te­rian High – Mr Ty­lor Jong and Mr Ni­cholas Lim – to set up TreeDots in 2017. The so­cial en­ter­prise is a bridge be­tween un­sold food in­ven­tory and buy­ers – usu­ally F&B busi­nesses – will­ing to buy them at dis­counted prices of up to 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>TreeDots uses a dig­i­tal plat­form which does a nifty job of match­ing buyer and seller, and en­abling quick trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>For the for­mer ac­coun­tant and his part­ners – also from the fi­nance trade – the busi­ness makes sense on sev­eral lev­els: It is sus­tain­able, helps busi­nesses save money, pre­vents food wastage and has so­cial im­pact. He says: “We told our­selves: ‘No mat­ter how al­tru­is­tic, what we do has to make busi­ness sense. It has to be sus­tain­able’.”</p>
    <p>Pleas­ant and per­son­able, Mr Lau is the youngest of three chil­dren of a house­wife and a re­tired Grab driver.</p>
    <p>His par­ents gave him a long leash. “For them, it was do what­ever you want as long as you take care of your grades. Don’t cause trou­ble,” he says.</p>
    <p>To earn pocket money, he took on all sorts of gigs – “sell­ing ice cream, dis­tribut­ing fly­ers, and work­ing in cafes and restau­rants”.</p>
    <p>“You learn to in­ter­act with all sorts of peo­ple and to be streets­mart,” says Mr Lau, who also ran a blogshop sell­ing men’s T-shirts.</p>
    <p>At school, he hung out with a group of about 10 friends, in­clud­ing Mr Jong and Mr Lim. “What do we have in com­mon? I’d say we are old souls. We still get to­gether at least once a month,” he says.</p>
    <p>He opted for ac­coun­tancy in­stead of busi­ness at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, even though he was sure he would end up start­ing a busi­ness. “A good com­pany needs strong fi­nan­cials and I wanted to un­der­stand that.”</p>
    <p>His so­cial con­science got a prod when he lived in a small town near Frank­furt for six months on a stu­dent ex­change pro­gramme in 2015.</p>
    <p>The Ger­mans are very green and en­vi­ron­men­tally con­scious, he says. He re­calls how his land­lord once be­rated him for throw­ing out the trash with­out sort­ing out the items for re­cy­cling.</p>
    <p>“He said: ‘Ev­ery­body does it. Why can’t you guys do it?’ So, we started to do it too and it felt good.”</p>
    <p>Upon grad­u­at­ing in 2016, Mr Lau joined pro­fes­sional ser­vices firm Price­wa­ter­house­C­oop­ers as a fi­nan­cial ser­vices au­di­tor and fin­tech as­so­ci­ate. He was well-paid and his ca­reer prospects were good, but he did not find work ful­fill­ing.</p>
    <p>Over din­ner one night with Mr Jong and Mr Lim – both Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity grad­u­ates then work­ing in the con­sult­ing and fi­nance in­dus­tries – the is­sue of sus­tain­able liv­ing and food wastage cropped up.</p>
    <p>“We all had strong feel­ings about it and felt it was a good cause we could sup­port, so we de­cided to find out more about it,” he says.</p>
    <p>Their re­search shocked them, es­pe­cially statis­tics which in­di­cated that B2B trans­ac­tions ac­counted for more than 85 per cent of food wastage.</p>
    <p>“Think­ing about the large amounts of food be­ing thrown, the ques­tions on our minds were: ‘Does this food have mar­ket value? Why is it be­ing thrown? Is there a way we can mon­e­tise this by cre­at­ing a ser­vice to clear such prod­ucts?’”</p>
    <p>The first to quit his job to get the ball rolling, Mr Lau was not fazed by what many saw as a risky un­der­tak­ing. “I be­lieve ev­ery­thing is fated. Things hap­pen for a rea­son, so let’s just go with the flow. Any­way, I have an ac­coun­tancy de­gree to fall back on and there will al­ways be a de­mand for ac­coun­tants,” he says, adding that his co-founders share the same sen­ti­ments.</p>
    <p>Get­ting it off the ground was ar­du­ous. The trio made cold calls and knocked on doors to speak to F&B busi­nesses which they knew noth­ing about.</p>
    <p>It re­quired thick skin, grit and stamina, but it helped them un­der­stand the in­dus­try and how they could add value to their op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>To save money on tech costs, Mr Lau turned pro­gram­mer. The three friends worked from home and did the de­liv­er­ies them­selves at the be­gin­ning. “I had two ac­ci­dents while do­ing de­liv­er­ies,” he re­calls, re­veal­ing the scars on his left leg.</p>
    <p>“We started pay­ing our­selves a salary only last year,” adds Mr Lau, who is in this year’s Forbes list of 30 Un­der 30 en­trepreneur­s and change-mak­ers in Asia.</p>
    <p>To keep them chug­ging along, they ap­plied for grants and took part in and won sev­eral com­pe­ti­tions, in­clud­ing So­cial Startup Chal­lenge 2018, us­ing the prize money to fund op­er­a­tions. Last year, DBS Foun­da­tion awarded them a grant to ac­cel­er­ate their growth and linked them up with other busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>TreeDots is com­ing along nicely. “We sold 900kg in 2018. Now, we are do­ing three to four tonnes of pro­duce a day,” Mr Lau says.</p>
    <p>Plans are afoot to ex­pand to neigh­bour­ing coun­tries, start­ing with Malaysia. “This is just the tip of the ice­berg. There’s so much that needs to be done. A lot of ed­u­ca­tion is needed to make busi­nesses and peo­ple re­alise how much food is be­ing wasted.”</p>
    <p>What are some of the big­gest mis­con­cep­tions about the food you sell?</p>
    <p>The big­gest mis­con­cep­tion is that the food is ei­ther ex­pir­ing or ugly and de­fec­tive. But most of the prod­ucts we deal with are un­sold due to rea­sons such as over-im­port and un­der-de­mand. As a re­sult, it has to be thrown away af­ter some time.</p>
    <p>How big is the food wastage prob­lem in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>Last year, Sin­ga­pore alone gen­er­ated about 744 mil­lion kg of food waste and over the past 10 years, this fig­ure has grown by about 20 per cent. You can get more in­for­ma­tion at str.sg/J6E9.</p>
    <p>Many of the food ven­dors you ap­proached are tra­di­tional fam­ily busi­nesses. Were they re­sis­tant and how dif­fi­cult was it to get them on board?</p>
    <p>In­ter­est­ingly, the con­cept of un­sold in­ven­to­ries isn’t new to food ven­dors. It ul­ti­mately still boils down to the pric­ing and qual­ity of the prod­ucts. It took us some time to un­der­stand the mar­ket and gain the ex­per­tise in match­ing the right prod­ucts to the right food ven­dors.</p>
    <p>What is not easy is get­ting the ven­dors to go dig­i­tal to stream­line trans­ac­tions. It took a lot of per­sua­sion and train­ing to get them on our plat­form and to pur­chase di­rectly through our app.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, or un­for­tu­nately, this is made slightly eas­ier with the wide­spread adop­tion of tech­nol­ogy, es­pe­cially among the older cit­i­zens, due to the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>You prob­a­bly have had many doors slammed in your face. Is fail­ure and re­jec­tion good for the soul?</p>
    <p>I’ve al­ways be­lieved that what is meant to be will be. It is un­avoid­able to en­counter fail­ure, but the fail­ures will build you up and pre­pare you for suc­cess in the fu­ture, even though you may not know when it will come.</p>
    <p>I’ve ex­pe­ri­enced this a cou­ple of times. I re­ally be­lieve fail­ures are lessons that pre­pare you for big­ger op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Do you agree food-waste knowl­edge is low? How can we im­prove it?</p>
    <p>I think food wastage is a topic that is highly dis­cussed among con­sumers, who can re­late to it. The food waste oc­cur­ring at the busi­ness level, how­ever, is an­other mat­ter. It is in­sane, but it is hush-hush.</p>
    <p>It is great to see the me­dia shin­ing more light on these is­sues. To im­prove the sit­u­a­tion and raise greater aware­ness. It is im­por­tant for those who know to ad­vo­cate and spread the word. Let oth­ers know about the prob­lems and so­lu­tions. En­cour­age one an­other to be sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>What are the three most ef­fec­tive ways to re­duce food waste in our daily lives?</p>
    <p>Do not be picky about pro­duce. Cos­metic fil­ter­ing is a big cause of food wastage and a re­sult of try­ing to sat­isfy the con­sumer’s un­re­al­is­tic ex­pec­ta­tion of what pro­duce should look like.</p>
    <p>Buy only what is needed. When you do that, the sup­pli­ers will pro­duce less to meet de­mand. With less pro­duc­tion, there is likely to be less wastage.</p>
    <p>Fin­ish your meals. Food wastage at the con­sumer level is small com­pared with the busi­ness level, but fin­ish­ing what is on your plate helps build the mind­set of not wast­ing food and it’s an im­por­tant first step.</p>
    <p>What does pur­pose mean to you?</p>
    <p>It is some­thing that drives me ev­ery day, the rea­son for me to get up ev­ery morn­ing. To me, TreeDots is the pur­pose.</p>
