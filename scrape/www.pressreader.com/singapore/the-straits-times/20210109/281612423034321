    <p>Here are some facts about the Bali bomb­ings and In­done­sia’s ef­forts to crack down on mil­i­tants. • On Oct 12, 2002, blasts tar­get­ing nightspots pop­u­lar with tourists in Bali’s Kuta Beach killed 202 peo­ple, in­clud­ing 88 Aus­tralians. Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI), a mil­i­tant net­work with ties to Al-Qaeda, was blamed for In­done­sia’s worst ter­ror­ist at­tack, and three mem­bers of the group were later ex­e­cuted for their role in the bomb­ings. JI was also linked to a se­ries of other at­tacks, in­clud­ing the 2003 bomb­ing of the JW Mar­riott ho­tel in Jakarta, the 2004 Aus­tralian Em­bassy bomb­ing, a sec­ond round of bomb­ings in Bali in 2005 and an­other at­tack on the</p>
    <p>Mar­riott and the Ritz-Carl­ton ho­tel in 2009.</p>
    <p>In the wake of the Bali at­tacks and with back­ing from Aus­tralia and the United States, In­done­sia set up an elite anti-ter­ror­ist unit called Den­sus 88 that weak­ened JI and re­sulted in scores of sus­pected mil­i­tants be­ing ar­rested or killed.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia has also pi­o­neered de­rad­i­cal­i­sa­tion schemes for con­victed mil­i­tants, some of whom had trained in Afghanista­n, Pak­istan and the south­ern Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>As JI has dropped out of the head­lines, other groups such as Ja­maah An­sharut Daulah (JAD), in­spired by the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have in­creased in promi­nence and been blamed for new at­tacks.</p>
    <p>A resur­gence in at­tacks has also been linked to the hun­dreds of In­done­sians who went to Syria and Iraq to fight for ISIS be­fore re­turn­ing home.</p>
    <p>Po­lice blamed JAD for sui­cide at­tacks in 2018 on churches and a po­lice post in the city of Surabaya that killed over 30 peo­ple and were car­ried out by two rad­i­calised fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>In the af­ter­math of these at­tacks, In­done­sia’s Par­lia­ment ap­proved tougher anti-ter­ror­ism laws, in­clud­ing pow­ers to pre-emp­tively detain sus­pects for longer and pros­e­cute those who join or re­cruit for mil­i­tant groups. De­spite JI’s fad­ing promi­nence, Zulka­r­naen, a man be­lieved to be one of JI’s most se­nior mem­bers and in­volved in mak­ing bombs for its at­tacks, was ar­rested last month af­ter avoid­ing de­tec­tion for years.</p>
    <p>Ms Nava Nu­raniyah, a re­searcher on mil­i­tant Is­lam study­ing at the Aus­tralian Na­tional Univer­sity, said JI cur­rently ap­peared less of a risk than ISIS-linked cells for launch­ing at­tacks. JI was now fo­cused on re­cruit­ment, build­ing net­works, fund­ing and pre­par­ing mil­i­tary ca­pac­ity, she said. It had also used the Syr­ian con­flict as a way of send­ing mem­bers for train­ing abroad. “JI re­mains dan­ger­ous, but dan­ger­ous in the long run,” she said.</p>
