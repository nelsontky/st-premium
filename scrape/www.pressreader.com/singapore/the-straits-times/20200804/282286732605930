    <p>TOKYO • Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ers yes­ter­day un­veiled the new sched­ule for the coro­n­avirus-post­poned Par­a­lympics next year, with only mi­nor mod­i­fi­ca­tions to the orig­i­nal cal­en­dar for the event.</p>
    <p>The his­toric de­ci­sion to de­lay the 2020 Games over the pan­demic means the Par­a­lympics are now sched­uled to run from Aug 24 to Sept 5, 2021.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme will fea­ture 539 events across 22 sports, with mod­i­fi­ca­tions made only to start and fin­ish times for some events, or­gan­is­ers said at a press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing the sched­ule fixed is a big step for ath­letes. We would like to con­tinue our work to cre­ate a safe and se­cure Games,” Tokyo 2020 Games de­liv­ery of­fi­cer Hide­masa Naka­mura told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The post­pone­ment of the qua­dren­nial event has cre­ated a mas­sive headache for or­gan­is­ers, as they nav­i­gate ev­ery­thing from se­cur­ing venues to de­vis­ing coro­n­avirus coun­ter­mea­sures.</p>
    <p>So far spe­cific mea­sures to pre­vent in­fec­tion have not been an­nounced, with de­ci­sions ex­pected some time this au­tumn.</p>
    <p>For the Par­a­lympics in par­tic­u­lar, of­fi­cials said they are mind­ful that they must cater to the needs of in­di­vid­ual ath­letes and spec­ta­tors with a range of dif­fer­ent health and phys­i­cal re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tional mea­sures against the virus may also be needed be­cause of the ex­tra time re­quired to move para-ath­letes be­tween venues.</p>
    <p>Tokyo or­gan­is­ers said they are also work­ing with the In­ter­na­tional Par­a­lympic Com­mit­tee to as­sess how the vi­ral pan­demic has af­fected ath­letes in var­i­ous coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese Par­a­lympian and taek­wondo fighter Mit­suya Tanaka told re­porters at the brief­ing that the pan­demic has deeply af­fected ath­letes.</p>
    <p>“In taek­wondo, we go face to face. We have re­stric­tions dur­ing spar­ring, for ex­am­ple. Com­pared to the time be­fore the coro­n­avirus, we can­not prac­tise like we used to,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Of course we are all con­cerned. I am too. But we will do what we can to man­age our safety. All the other ath­letes are do­ing the same as they pre­pare for this. I be­lieve that’s the duty of ath­letes.”</p>
    <p>Much about the resched­uled Games re­mains un­cer­tain, in­clud­ing the cost of the post­pone­ment and whether the event will be fea­si­ble if a vac­cine or treat­ment for the virus is not found.</p>
    <p>Among the pro­pos­als mooted for hold­ing the Games dur­ing a pan­demic is a re­duc­tion in the num­ber of spec­ta­tors, though Olympic of­fi­cials have said they are not keen on lim­it­ing fans and do not want to hold the event be­hind closed doors.</p>
