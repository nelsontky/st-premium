    <p>For nearly two years, home-grown cup­cake chain Twelve Cupcakes un­der­paid seven of its for­eign em­ploy­ees, even short-chang­ing one worker by about half the wages at times.</p>
    <p>The com­pany yes­ter­day pleaded guilty to 15 counts of un­der­pay­ing the em­ploy­ees in 2017 and 2018.</p>
    <p>Four­teen other sim­i­lar charges will be taken into con­sid­er­a­tion by District Judge Adam Nakhoda dur­ing sen­tenc­ing, which is ex­pected to take place on Jan 7.</p>
    <p>Twelve Cupcakes was founded by ra­dio DJ Daniel Ong and for­mer model Jaime Teo in 2011 and was ac­quired for $2.5 mil­lion by Kolkatabas­ed Dhun­seri Group in 2016.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments state that all seven em­ploy­ees were S-Pass hold­ers at the time of the of­fences.</p>
    <p>It is not stated if they are still work­ing for the com­pany.</p>
    <p>While their fixed monthly salaries ranged from $2,200 to $2,600, they were in­stead paid about $1,400 to $2,050 by the com­pany.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Twelve Cupcakes un­der­paid six of the em­ploy­ees – who were in cus­tomer ser­vice and sales roles – their salaries for the pe­riod be­tween De­cem­ber 2016 and Septem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>One of these six work­ers was also un­der­paid the Oc­to­ber and Novem­ber 2018 wages.</p>
    <p>The com­pany also paid less than the fixed monthly salary – for the pe­riod be­tween Jan­uary 2017 and Septem­ber 2018 – due to the re­main­ing em­ployee, a pas­try chef.</p>
    <p>Twelve Cupcakes had ini­tially cred­ited the re­duced salaries to the em­ploy­ees’ bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>But they later changed tac­tics, pay­ing the work­ers their full salary from May 2018, but then telling the em­ploy­ees that they had to re­turn a por­tion to the com­pany in cash.</p>
    <p>Twelve Cupcakes had done so to con­ceal a pa­per trail of its of­fences, said Min­istry of Man­power pros­e­cu­tor Max­i­m­il­ian Chew, urg­ing the court to im­pose a fine of $127,000.</p>
    <p>He said that Twelve Cupcakes would have con­tin­ued un­der­pay­ing the em­ploy­ees if the of­fences had not been dis­cov­ered.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tor also said that Sin­ga­pore is heav­ily re­liant on for­eign em­ploy­ees in many sec­tors, in­clud­ing the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>There was there­fore “enor­mous pub­lic in­ter­est” in hold­ing com­pa­nies ac­count­able for their wel­fare, in­clud­ing pay­ing their salaries fully and promptly, he added.</p>
    <p>De­fence lawyer Sel­vara­jan Bala­mu­ru­gan said in mit­i­ga­tion that his client had made full resti­tu­tion to the em­ploy­ees even be­fore court pro­ceed­ings started.</p>
    <p>For each of­fence in­volv­ing un­der­pay­ing its for­eign em­ploy­ees, a com­pany may be fined up to $10,000.</p>
