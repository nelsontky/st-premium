    <p>GENEVA • This year is on course to be one of the three warm­est recorded and could even top the record set in 2016, the United Na­tions has said.</p>
    <p>The past six years, 2015 to 2020, are there­fore set to make up all six of the hottest years since mod­ern records be­gan in 1850, the UN’s World Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WMO) said in its pro­vi­sional 2020 State of the Global Cli­mate re­port.</p>
    <p>“2020 has, un­for­tu­nately, been yet an­other ex­tra­or­di­nary year for our cli­mate,” said WMO sec­re­tary-gen­eral Pet­teri Taalas.</p>
    <p>“The av­er­age global tem­per­a­ture in 2020 is set to be about 1.2 deg C above the pre-in­dus­trial level,” said Pro­fes­sor Taalas.</p>
    <p>“There is at least a one in five chance of it tem­po­rar­ily ex­ceed­ing 1.5 deg C by 2024.”</p>
    <p>The WMO said 2020 seemed on course to be the sec­ond-hottest year – but the dif­fer­ence be­tween the top three is small and the pic­ture could change once this year’s data sets are com­plete.</p>
    <p>The years from 2015 to 2020 are there­fore in­di­vid­u­ally “likely to be the six warm­est on record”, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>Prof Taalas said this year saw “new ex­treme tem­per­a­tures on land, sea and es­pe­cially in the Arc­tic”.</p>
    <p>“Wild­fires con­sumed vast ar­eas in Aus­tralia, Siberia, the US West Coast and South Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>“Flood­ing in parts of Africa and South-east Asia led to mas­sive pop­u­la­tion dis­place­ment and un­der­mined food se­cu­rity for mil­lions.”</p>
    <p>Green­house gases in the at­mos­phere – the main driver of cli­mate change – hit record highs last year and con­tin­ued climb­ing this year de­spite mea­sures to halt the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Yet the world is plan­ning to pro­duce more than dou­ble the amount of coal, oil and gas in 2030 than would be con­sis­tent with curb­ing global warm­ing, the UN and re­search groups said sep­a­rately on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Some of the largest fos­sil fuel pro­duc­ers in the world, in­clud­ing Aus­tralia, China, Canada and the United States, are among those pur­su­ing ma­jor ex­pan­sions in fos­sil fuel sup­ply.</p>
    <p>Un­der the 2015 Paris Agree­ment, na­tions have com­mit­ted to a long-term goal of lim­it­ing av­er­age tem­per­a­ture rise to be­low 2 deg C above pre-in­dus­trial lev­els and to pur­sue ef­forts to limit it even fur­ther to 1.5 deg C.</p>
    <p>The 1.5 deg C tar­get re­quires fos­sil fuel pro­duc­tion to de­crease by around 6 per cent per year be­tween 2020 and 2030.</p>
    <p>In­stead, coun­tries are plan­ning an av­er­age an­nual in­crease of 2 per cent, which by 2030 would re­sult in more than dou­ble the pro­duc­tion con­sis­tent with the 1.5 deg C limit, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>Be­tween 2020 and 2030, global coal, oil, and gas pro­duc­tion would have to fall an­nu­ally by 11 per cent, 4 per cent, and 3 per cent re­spec­tively to be con­sis­tent with a 1.5 deg C path­way.</p>
    <p>“This gap is large, with coun­tries aim­ing to pro­duce 120 per cent more fos­sil fu­els by 2030 than would be con­sis­tent with lim­it­ing global warm­ing to 1.5 deg C,” the re­port said.</p>
    <p>The re­port was pro­duced by the UN En­vi­ron­ment Pro­gramme, as well as ex­perts from the Stock­holm En­vi­ron­ment In­sti­tute, the In­ter­na­tional In­sti­tute for Sus­tain­able De­vel­op­ment, the Over­seas De­vel­op­ment In­sti­tute, think-tank E3G and uni­ver­si­ties.</p>
