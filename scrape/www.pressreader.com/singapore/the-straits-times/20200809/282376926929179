    <p>At the height of the Covid-19 pan­demic in Sin­ga­pore, Ms Emily Yap’s 81-year-old grand­mother, who lives with her fam­ily and usu­ally does the gro­cery shop­ping, was afraid to go to the su­per­mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Know­ing the el­derly are most vul­ner­a­ble to the virus, she was re­luc­tant to stand in long queues and jos­tle with oth­ers, es­pe­cially when many items were un­avail­able.</p>
    <p>Her grand­mother’s fears made Ms Yap re­alise needy fam­i­lies might be even worse off.</p>
    <p>“On top of money be­ing tight, food stocks might be in short sup­ply in the neigh­bour­hoods where they live,” says the 21-yearold un­der­grad­u­ate, who is do­ing a nurs­ing de­gree of­fered by the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy and the Uni­ver­sity of Glas­gow.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing vol­un­teered reg­u­larly at grass­roots events for the past eight years, in­clud­ing some that in­volved chil­dren from the Move­ment for the In­tel­lec­tu­ally Dis­abled of Sin­ga­pore (Minds), Ms Yap knew how she could help.</p>
    <p>Funded by the Na­tional Youth Coun­cil’s Young Change­Mak­ers</p>
    <p>Grant, she roped in friends and fam­ily to de­liver gro­ceries and es­sen­tial items to 10 low-in­come fam­i­lies whose chil­dren are ben­e­fi­cia­ries of Minds.</p>
    <p>These fam­i­lies, who live in rental flats, are on short-term ComCare as­sis­tance, which means they have a max­i­mum house­hold in­come of $1,900, or $650 a per­son, each month.</p>
    <p>Each fam­ily could choose the items they needed within a $100 bud­get, and were given a Health Pro­mo­tion Board pam­phlet on healthy eat­ing to help them se­lect the items.</p>
    <p>“As a nurs­ing un­der­grad­u­ate, I un­der­stand that diet makes a dif­fer­ence in health and well­be­ing,” says Ms Yap, who de­liv­ered the items in June.</p>
    <p>About a week later, she fol­lowed up by post­ing a note of en­cour­age­ment to the stu­dents.</p>
    <p>She says: “Dur­ing this pe­riod, some might feel iso­lated or lonely. I wanted to let them know that bad days don’t last for­ever.</p>
    <p>“If ev­ery­one helps one an­other along the way, our com­mu­nity will be much hap­pier and more united.”</p>
