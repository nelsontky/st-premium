    <p>The western part of Sin­ga­pore is an up-and-com­ing area and holds promise for prop­erty buy­ers look­ing for bet­ter rental yields, says ERA se­nior di­vi­sion di­rec­tor Neo Chee Seng.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old is wait­ing for his new home in Cle­menti, which will be com­pleted around 2023. The 1,292 sq ft Parc Clema­tis con­do­minium unit will have four bed­rooms.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo says: “The rea­son we picked Parc Clema­tis is its lo­ca­tion and the de­vel­op­ments planned for the area. There is the de­vel­op­ment of Sin­ga­pore’s sec­ond Cen­tral Busi­ness District (CBD) in the Jurong Lake District, Jurong In­no­va­tion District and the new Tuas port, which com­bined will cre­ate (many) new jobs.”</p>
    <p>He also notes the con­struc­tion of two MRT lines – the Jurong Re­gion Line, which will be ready from around 2026, and the Cross Is­land Line from around 2029.</p>
    <p>“With new jobs cre­ated in the area, we be­lieve that more peo­ple will move to the western part of Sin­ga­pore in the com­ing years, driv­ing up de­mand for prop­er­ties.”</p>
    <p>Parc Clema­tis, a 99-year lease­hold con­do­minium, will be lo­cated close to Cle­menti MRT sta­tion.</p>
    <p>While wait­ing for his new home, Mr Neo is liv­ing with his fam­ily in a three-bed­room rented unit at Sig­na­ture Park con­do­minium in Toh Tuck Road.</p>
    <p>He has two chil­dren, aged 13 and 15, with his 47-year-old wife, who works as a se­nior qual­ity as­sur­ance ex­ec­u­tive in a phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo says: “Sig­na­ture Park came as the most nat­u­ral choice as this is an area that we have been liv­ing in for the past eight to nine years.</p>
    <p>“The unit is around 1,300 to 1,400 sq ft in size and the rental, slightly less than $3,000.”</p>
    <p>The fam­ily pre­vi­ously lived at the High Oak Con­do­minium in Toh Tuck Road, less than 300m from their cur­rent home. They bought the prop­erty in 2013.</p>
    <p>Mr Neo has an elec­tri­cal and elec­tronic en­gi­neer­ing de­gree from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, and a mas­ter’s in busi­ness and in­ter­na­tional mar­ket­ing from Curtin Univer­sity in Aus­tralia.</p>
    <p>Q What’s in your prop­erty port­fo­lio? A In 2004, I bought a re­sale 4A (largest model of four-room flats) Hous­ing Board flat in Jurong West for $220,000 with my wife, with a $40,000 hous­ing grant.</p>
    <p>We paid off our mort­gage in 2009 and rented out the flat for slightly more than 10 years, be­fore even­tu­ally sell­ing it for $372,000 to­wards the end of last year.</p>
    <p>In 2009, I also bought a 1,292 sq ft three-bed­room unit at The Flo­ravale in Jurong West for $622,000. It is a 99-year lease­hold de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>The plan was to use the rent from our HDB flat and my wife’s monthly Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) con­tri­bu­tion to cover the mort­gage on the con­do­minium, as well as prop­erty taxes.</p>
    <p>We rented out the prop­erty, which gave us a yield of around 3.8 per cent based on the val­u­a­tion then, and the rent we got was enough to cover the monthly instalment.</p>
    <p>In 2011, I be­gan a search for an af­ford­able in­dus­trial or com­mer­cial prop­erty and even­tu­ally bought a B1 in­dus­trial prop­erty in Toh Guan Road East, pay­ing $270,000 in March 2011.</p>
    <p>I pur­chased the unit through an in­vest­ment hold­ing com­pany I had in­cor­po­rated, and sold it in 2012 for $400,000.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter, I bought an­other B1 in­dus­trial prop­erty in Wood­lands In­dus­trial Park E1 in the same year.</p>
    <p>I paid $345,000 and its cur­rent es­ti­mated val­u­a­tion is around $380,000. I am pay­ing a mort­gage for the unit, which is cur­rently leased and earn­ing us a rental yield of around 4.7 per cent, based on present val­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The rent we earn is suf­fi­cient to cover the monthly instalment, main­te­nance fees and prop­erty tax.</p>
    <p>In 2013, I bought over my wife’s share in The Flo­ravale and there­after, she bought a three-bed­room, 1,195 sq ft unit at the High Oak Con­do­minium for $1.19 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The rent we got for our HDB flat and our monthly CPF Or­di­nary Ac­count con­tri­bu­tions cov­ered the monthly mort­gage pay­ments for the High Oak Con­do­minium, which we sold ear­lier this year for $1.22 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Early this year, we bought the prop­erty at Parc Clema­tis.</p>
    <p>I also re­cently sold The Flo­ravale unit for $863,000. The trans­ac­tion was com­pleted in mid-Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Q De­scribe your prop­erty in­vest­ing strat­egy.</p>
    <p>A Since 2013, we ob­served that the val­u­a­tions of HDB flats were falling as they got older. The price ap­pre­ci­a­tion of older con­do­mini­ums was also much slower than newer ones.</p>
    <p>We be­lieve this was the right time to re­ju­ve­nate our prop­erty port­fo­lio by sell­ing our HDB flat and the High Oak Con­do­minium unit and putting our money into newer prop­er­ties with bet­ter price</p>
    <p>ap­pre­ci­a­tion po­ten­tial.</p>
    <p>When buy­ing prop­erty, I usu­ally take a look at its up­side po­ten­tial, rentabil­ity, prox­im­ity to train sta­tions, ameni­ties and dis­tance from the work­place and schools.</p>
    <p>For a prop­erty that is both for in­vest­ment and liv­ing, I con­sider how con­ve­nient it is to get to the of­fice and my chil­dren’s schools, which are now Hwa Chong In­sti­tu­tion and River Val­ley High School.</p>
    <p>Q What’s your view of the prop­erty mar­ket?</p>
    <p>A I be­lieve this is a good time to en­ter the mar­ket. The Gov­ern­ment has done an ex­cel­lent job of man­ag­ing the prop­erty mar­ket in the past seven years.</p>
    <p>But while the mar­ket may seem ro­bust de­spite fi­nan­cial strains caused by the Covid-19 out­break, buy­ers should still prac­tise care­ful con­sid­er­a­tion be­fore buy­ing a prop­erty.</p>
    <p>I ad­vise buy­ers to check their loan el­i­gi­bil­ity and en­sure there is suf­fi­cient cash for a down pay­ment.</p>
    <p>Avoid over­stretch­ing monthly ex­pen­di­tures to fund the mort­gage. Pur­chas­ing a prop­erty that is within a com­fort­able bud­get is im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>They should en­sure there are enough re­serve funds for at least one to two years, in case there is a need to tide over dif­fi­cult times, such as un­em­ploy­ment or med­i­cal emer­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>Buy­ers should also research and sign up for mort­gage in­sur­ance. The in­sur­ance pro­vides se­cu­rity and pro­tects fam­ily and loved ones in case of death or per­ma­nent dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Q What’s your fi­nanc­ing strat­egy?</p>
    <p>A Usu­ally, I will stretch the loan ten­ure so that the monthly com­mit­ment is lower.</p>
    <p>De­pend­ing on whether the in­ter­est rates are likely to in­crease or de­crease, I will choose a fixed in­ter­est rate or float­ing in­ter­est rate ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>I re­fi­nance my prop­erty loan reg­u­larly to en­sure I don’t have to pay ex­ces­sive in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>I will al­ways en­sure that both my wife and I take suf­fi­cient term in­sur­ance to cover our out­stand­ing loans in case of death or per­ma­nent dis­abil­ity. I have term in­sur­ance cov­er­age of $800,000, while my wife is cov­ered for $1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Q What’s your over­all in­vest­ing strat­egy?</p>
    <p>A I in­vest in shares, land bank­ing and en­dow­ment poli­cies. To re­duce taxes and plan for my re­tire­ment, I will con­trib­ute to the Sup­ple­men­tary Re­tire­ment Scheme.</p>
    <p>The funds will then be used to buy prod­ucts that give a low risk of 2 per cent to 3 per cent av­er­age re­turns.</p>
    <p>I will also max out on vol­un­tary CPF con­tri­bu­tions, which of­fer high in­ter­est rates, and I can choose to with­draw them af­ter I turn 55, hav­ing met the pre­vail­ing CPF re­tire­ment sum re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>About 60 per cent of my in­vest­ment is in prop­erty, 10 per cent in other in­stru­ments such as shares, land bank­ing and en­dow­ment poli­cies, 20 per cent as work­ing funds to grow my real es­tate busi­ness, and an­other 10 per cent is emer­gency funds for un­ex­pected events within the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Q My dream home is...</p>
    <p>A A three-storey landed prop­erty with four to five bed­rooms, with each bed­room able to ac­com­mo­date a king-size bed and a study or work area.</p>
    <p>It would also have de­cent-sized din­ing and liv­ing ar­eas, where the whole fam­ily can gather.</p>
    <p>Ide­ally, the house would also have a gar­den so I can in­vite friends, busi­ness part­ners and as­so­ciates for a bar­be­cue or get-to­gether.</p>
    <p>Q With re­gard to your busi­ness, what is your in­vest­ing strat­egy?</p>
    <p>A I started my real es­tate ca­reer as a sales­man in Jan­uary 2006 with $20,000 start-up cap­i­tal to last me for at least six to nine months. I broke even within a month, though my cash flow turned pos­i­tive only about six months later.</p>
    <p>I started team build­ing in 2007 and to­day, along­side three part­ners, I am lead­ing the Dy­namic Force Group, which con­sists of more than 400 real es­tate sales­men and women in ERA Sin­ga­pore. We hope to dou­ble our team sales and size in the next three to five years.</p>
    <p>Q Money­wise, what were your grow­ing-up years like?</p>
    <p>A My fa­ther was a truck driver who ran a small trans­port com­pany and my mother worked part-time. They are now re­tired. I have a younger brother and sister.</p>
    <p>We lived in an HDB rental flat un­til I was 12 years old. Af­ter my Pri­mary School Leav­ing Ex­am­i­na­tion, we fi­nally moved to my par­ents’ first HDB home, which they are still liv­ing in to­day.</p>
    <p>Our fam­ily was not well-to-do, so we learnt to be thrifty.</p>
    <p>Walk­ing 20 min­utes to save on bus fare and wear­ing over­sized uni­forms so that we did not have to buy new ones every year were the norm. We also made it a point to save part of our pocket money, even though it was not much to be­gin with.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing school holidays, my friends and I would of­ten go door to door to sell home­made fried bee hoon and fish­balls to make some money to help out with our fam­ily ex­penses.</p>
    <p>With a tight bud­get, we did not buy brand-new ap­pli­ances or re­place old ones. As long as they served their func­tion and were still work­ing fine, we were con­tent. Money did not come eas­ily, so we tried to save when­ever pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>My par­ents are firm be­liev­ers in the value of ed­u­ca­tion. They pushed us to study hard when we were young.</p>
    <p>They be­lieve that only through ed­u­ca­tion could my sib­lings and I have a bet­ter life when we grew up. My par­ents must be proud to see all of us com­plete our univer­sity ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
