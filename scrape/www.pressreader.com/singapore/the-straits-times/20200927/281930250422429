    <p>• South Korea urged the North yes­ter­day to fur­ther in­ves­ti­gate the fa­tal shoot­ing of a South Korean fish­eries of­fi­cial and sug­gested it could be an un­prece­dented joint probe by the two sides, as pub­lic and po­lit­i­cal out­rage over the killing grew.</p>
    <p>The move came as a rare apol­ogy from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ap­pears to have failed to soothe pub­lic crit­i­cism over the han­dling of the in­ci­dent by Pres­i­dent Moon</p>
    <p>Jae-in’s gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a Na­tional Se­cu­rity Coun­cil meet­ing last night, South Korea’s pres­i­den­tial of­fice said it would call for a joint probe into the case with the North if needed, say­ing there were dis­crep­an­cies in ac­counts of the ac­ci­dent from the two sides.</p>
    <p>The South Korean mil­i­tary last Thurs­day said sol­diers from the North killed the man, doused his body in fuel and set it on fire near the sea border.</p>
    <p>But the Py­ongyang gov­ern­ment said in a mes­sage on Friday that its sol­diers shot the “il­le­gal in­truder” and de­nied burn­ing his body.</p>
    <p>The two Koreas have not con­ducted joint probes into pre­vi­ous ac­ci­dents, in­clud­ing the death of a South Korean tourist who was shot at the North’s moun­tain re­sort of Kum­gang in 2008, and the North’s bomb­ing of Yeon­pyeong Is­land which killed four South Kore­ans in 2010. The two Koreas are tech­ni­cally still at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce.</p>
    <p>“A chance of a joint probe is low. How on earth can we in­ves­ti­gate the North Korean mil­i­tary?” said Uni­ver­sity of North Korean Stud­ies pro­fes­sor Yang Moo-jin in Seoul.</p>
    <p>The North has tight­ened border con­trols due to the Covid-19 out­break, which fur­ther com­pli­cates the prospect of the joint in­ves­ti­ga­tion, he said.</p>
    <p>“Given Kim quickly of­fered a rare apol­ogy, there is a pos­si­bil­ity of an ex­change of writ­ten ques­tions and an­swers be­tween two Koreas,” Pro­fes­sor Yang said.</p>
    <p>The op­po­si­tion Peo­ple Power Party yes­ter­day said Mr Kim’s apol­ogy was not gen­uine, call­ing on the Moon gov­ern­ment to send the case to the In­ter­na­tional Crim­i­nal Court and the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>The Moon ad­min­is­tra­tion faces an in­tense po­lit­i­cal back­lash over how it re­sponded to the in­ci­dent, which co­in­cided with a re­newed push by the Pres­i­dent for en­gage­ment with Py­ongyang.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics ques­tioned why the mil­i­tary did not at­tempt to save the man de­spite al­legedly spot­ting him six hours be­fore he was shot dead.</p>
    <p>“Peace is im­por­tant in in­ter-Korean re­la­tions, but the most im­por­tant thing is the lives of our peo­ple. Our peo­ple were shot by North Korea and why there is no such move­ment as ‘Korean lives mat­ter’ in South Korea?” said Mr Thae Yong Ho, a for­mer North Korean deputy am­bas­sador to Lon­don who de­fected to the South, and be­came a law­maker.</p>
