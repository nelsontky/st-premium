    <p>As strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion with Bei­jing and its con­duct in han­dling the coro­n­avirus pan­demic be­come hot po­lit­i­cal is­sues in the United States, Amer­i­cans’ views of China have con­tin­ued to sour, ac­cord­ing to a new Pew Re­search Cen­tre sur­vey.</p>
    <p>To­day, 73 per cent of US adults say they have an un­favourable view of the coun­try, up 26 per­cent­age points since 2018, the Pew Re­search found.</p>
    <p>The data was ob­tained from a na­tion­ally rep­re­sen­ta­tive sur­vey of 1,003 US adults con­ducted by tele­phone from June 16 to July 14.</p>
    <p>“Since March alone, neg­a­tive views of China have in­creased 7 points, and there is a wide­spread sense that China mis­han­dled the ini­tial out­break and sub­se­quent spread of Covid-19,” it said.</p>
    <p>Around two-thirds of Amer­i­cans (64 per cent) say China has done a bad job of deal­ing with the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>Seventy-eight per cent placed “a great deal or fair amount of the blame for the global spread of the coro­n­avirus on the Chi­nese govern­ment’s ini­tial han­dling of the Covid-19 out­break in Wuhan”, the sur­vey found.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans are par­tic­u­larly crit­i­cal; 73 per cent be­lieve China’s early han­dling of the pan­demic</p>
    <p>Pro­por­tion of Amer­i­cans who say China has done a bad job of deal­ing with the coro­n­avirus out­break. con­trib­uted a great deal to its spread, com­pared with 38 per cent of Democrats who say the same, the report said.</p>
    <p>Faith in China’s Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping to “do the right thing in world af­fairs” has also de­te­ri­o­rated.</p>
    <p>As many as 77 per cent of those sur­veyed have lit­tle or no con­fi­dence in him, up six per­cent­age points since March and 27 points since last year.</p>
    <p>Also, around seven in 10 (68 per cent) said cur­rent eco­nomic ties be­tween the su­per­pow­ers are in bad shape. This is up 15 per­cent­age points since May last year.</p>
    <p>And around one in four de­scribes China as an en­emy of the US – al­most dou­ble the share who said this when the ques­tion was last asked in 2012.</p>
    <p>Older Amer­i­cans have a more un­favourable view of China.</p>
    <p>“Amer­i­cans (aged) 50 and older are sub­stan­tially more neg­a­tive (81 per cent) than those… un­der 30 (56 per cent),” Pew Re­search said.</p>
    <p>And con­sis­tent with Amer­ica’s po­lit­i­cal di­vide, the sur­vey also found that Repub­li­cans, and Repub­li­can-lean­ing in­de­pen­dents, are sig­nif­i­cantly more likely than Democrats and Demo­cratic lean­ers to have a very un­favourable view of China, to crit­i­cise the Chi­nese govern­ment’s role in the global pan­demic, and to want to take a tougher pol­icy ap­proach to China.</p>
    <p>While the di­vided per­cep­tion of China has been a fea­ture for 15 years, the gap is widen­ing, the report noted.</p>
    <p>“In the past four months, neg­a­tive views to­wards China among Repub­li­cans have in­creased 11 per­cent­age points,” it said. “Over the same pe­riod of time, un­favourable views among Democrats have in­creased 6 points, re­sult­ing in a 15 point gap be­tween the par­ties.”</p>
