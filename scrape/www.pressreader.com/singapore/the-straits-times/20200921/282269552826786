    <p>More than a dozen cen­tral banks will this week con­front a new re­al­ity where mon­e­tary pol­icy in the world’s big­gest econ­omy is set to stay ul­tra-loose for the fore­see­able fu­ture.</p>
    <p>With the Fed­eral Re­serve’s re­cent sig­nal that United States in­ter­est rates should be kept low for at least three years, of­fi­cials meet­ing from Swe­den to New Zealand have one more as­sump­tion on which to base their de­ci­sion-mak­ing, be­yond the knowl­edge that the coro­n­avirus re­mains un­tamed.</p>
    <p>That guid­ance from the Fed in­cor­po­rates a reimag­ined pol­icy frame­work to al­low in­fla­tion to over­shoot af­ter pe­ri­ods of un­der­per­for­mance, a stance that al­ready star­tled the global mon­e­tary au­thor­i­ties by weak­en­ing the dol­lar when it was un­veiled last month.</p>
    <p>While a cheaper US cur­rency, en­trenched by low rates, could af­fect the in­fla­tion out­looks of other cen­tral banks, few are likely to re­spond with im­me­di­ate loos­en­ing them­selves.</p>
    <p>Of the 16 or so de­ci­sions sched­uled for the next few days, most should show pol­icy on hold at an al­ready easy set­ting. Colom­bia and Mex­ico, both prox­i­mate to the US, may still cut their bench­marks.</p>
    <p>US AND CANADA</p>
    <p>Fed chair­man Jerome Pow­ell tes­ti­fies be­fore con­gres­sional com­mit­tees for three straight days – to­mor­row, Wed­nes­day and Thurs­day – to dis­cuss the re­sponse to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He will likely face ques­tions about the broader state of the econ­omy and fis­cal stim­u­lus.</p>
    <p>Weekly data on Thurs­day will show­case the level of con­tin­u­ing un­em­ploy­ment ben­e­fit claims for the week ended Sept 12, a key met­ric in econ­o­mists’ es­ti­mates for the monthly jobs report that is due on Oct 2.</p>
    <p>Au­gust home sales and durable-goods or­ders are also com­ing out.</p>
    <p>EUROPE, MID­DLE EAST, AFRICA</p>
    <p>Bank of Eng­land (BOE) gov­er­nor An­drew Bai­ley will have a chance to clar­ify the BOE’s sur­pris­ing com­ments on prepa­ra­tions for neg­a­tive rates when he speaks to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>That same day, Bri­tish data will shed more light on the dam­age that the fall­out from the pan­demic has done to pub­lic fi­nances.</p>
    <p>Sur­veys in Bri­tain and the euro area later in the week will give in­vestors in­sight into whether the re­bound from the pan­demic has peaked, with a surge in new in­fec­tions now threat­en­ing to put that re­cov­ery in jeop­ardy.</p>
    <p>Switzer­land’s cen­tral bank is set to keep its rate at mi­nus 0.75 per cent, while Nor­way and Swe­den are fore­cast to stick with zero per cent, and Czech pol­i­cy­mak­ers will prob­a­bly stay at 0.25 per cent.</p>
    <p>In Hun­gary, pol­i­cy­mak­ers will de­cide on rates too, with in­fla­tion hov­er­ing around the top of their tol­er­ance band and the forint near a record low.</p>
    <p>Turkey holds its rate-set­ting meet­ing on Thurs­day af­ter the lira hit con­sec­u­tive record lows in past weeks. The mon­e­tary author­ity has so far re­sorted to back­door tight­en­ing to avoid an out­right rate hike, a move that Pres­i­dent Re­cep Tayyip Er­do­gan has said he would op­pose.</p>
    <p>Nige­ria will prob­a­bly hold the key rate with in­fla­tion stuck above the tar­get band of 6 per cent to 9 per cent since 2015 and show­ing no sign of eas­ing.</p>
    <p>Egypt, one of the few economies in the re­gion ex­pected to ex­pand this year, may also main­tain pol­icy as the au­thor­i­ties seek to en­tice for­eign in­vestors with a rel­a­tively high yield.</p>
    <p>ASIA</p>
    <p>China sets its loan prime rate today, with no change ex­pected.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the Re­serve Bank of New Zealand’s pol­icy meet­ing will be scru­ti­nised for any signs that it is closer to adopt­ing neg­a­tive rates.</p>
    <p>Thai­land’s cen­tral bank also meets on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>On the data front, South Korean trade data for the first 20 days of this month will be closely watched to see whether a re­cov­ery in global com­merce con­tin­ues.</p>
    <p>LATIN AMER­ICA</p>
    <p>Brazil’s cen­tral bank posts to­mor­row the min­utes of last week’s meet­ing, which will of­fer a closer look at the de­ci­sion to hold at a record-low 2 per cent.</p>
    <p>Two days later, the bank pub­lishes its quar­terly in­fla­tion report up­dat­ing crit­i­cal eco­nomic forecasts and for­ward guid­ance.</p>
    <p>Later on Thurs­day, Mex­ico may opt to ease for a record 11th straight meet­ing to put the key rate at 4.25 per cent, even with in­fla­tion just above the top of the bank’s tar­get range.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, Colom­bia may ex­tend a six-month eas­ing cy­cle and lower bor­row­ing costs to a record-low 1.75 per cent.</p>
    <p>On the data front, Ar­gentina is the last of the re­gion’s big economies to report sec­ond-quar­ter out­put, with the year-on-year fig­ure ex­pected to come in near Mex­ico’s mi­nus 18.9 per cent.</p>
