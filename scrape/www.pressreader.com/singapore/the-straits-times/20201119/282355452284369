    <p>• The Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) will use a play-off tour­na­ment to de­ter­mine the sev­enth and eighth seeds in both con­fer­ences in the 2020-2021 post-sea­son, ac­cord­ing to a new for­mat un­veiled by the league on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The short­ened sea­son tips off on Dec 22, with each team play­ing 72 games rather than the tra­di­tional 82 games, so the play-offs can be com­pleted in July and play­ers made avail­able for the Olympics.</p>
    <p>The post-sea­son will open on May 18. The big­gest change to the for­mat is the new method for de­ter­min­ing the top eight post-sea­son teams from the Eastern and Western Con­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, the top eight teams in each con­fer­ence ad­vanced to the play-offs. Un­der the new for­mat, the teams in each con­fer­ence with the sev­enth- and eighth-high­est win­ning per­cent­ages will play each other.</p>
    <p>The win­ner of that game will take the sev­enth seed­ing. The loser will then play the win­ner of a play-off be­tween the ninth- and 10th-placed teams for the eighth and fi­nal play-off berth.</p>
    <p>A sim­i­lar sys­tem was used last sea­son when the league restarted in the Or­lando “bub­ble” fol­low­ing a four-month shut­down due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A full sched­ule for the new sea­son will be rolled out in stages, with the first half re­vealed dur­ing pre-sea­son train­ing camps.</p>
    <p>Fixtures for the se­cond half of the cam­paign will be con­firmed mid­way through the sea­son but the 72-game sched­ule is not ex­pected to be per­fectly bal­anced.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Mil­wau­kee Bucks, un­der im­mense pres­sure to up­grade their ros­ter to per­suade reign­ing Most Valu­able Player Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo to pledge his long-term fu­ture, ar­ranged a bold trade late on Mon­day to ac­quire the in-de­mand Jrue Hol­i­day from the New Orleans Pel­i­cans.</p>
    <p>For­ward Bog­dan Bog­danovich will also move to the Bucks from the Sacra­mento Kings, with both trades not made of­fi­cial un­til the NBA league year be­gins this week­end.</p>
