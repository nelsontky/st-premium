    <p>China’s an­titrust watch­dog is seek­ing feed­back on a raft of reg­u­la­tions that es­tab­lish a frame­work for curb­ing be­hav­iour such as col­lud­ing on shar­ing sen­si­tive con­sumer data, al­liances that squeeze out smaller ri­vals and sub­si­dis­ing ser­vices at be­low cost to elim­i­nate com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>This is a wa­ter­shed mo­ment. MR MA CHEN, a Bei­jing-based part­ner at Han Kun Law Of­fices, on greater fin­tech scru­tiny by the au­thor­i­ties.</p>
    <p>• China’s top bank­ing watch­dog dou­bled down on a re­newed push to rein in fi­nan­cial tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies such as Ant Group, promis­ing to elim­i­nate mo­nop­o­lis­tic prac­tices and strengthen risk con­trols in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The news sent Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy shares tum­bling for a sec­ond day, wip­ing out more than US$200 bil­lion (S$270 bil­lion) of value.</p>
    <p>Mr Liang Tao, a vice-chair­man of the China Bank­ing and In­sur­ance Reg­u­la­tory Com­mis­sion (CBIRC), said at a con­fer­ence in Bei­jing yes­ter­day that fin­tech does not change the na­ture of the fi­nan­cial in­dus­try and reg­u­la­tors should be at­ten­tive to the risks and chal­lenges of dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Firms should get the same su­per­vi­sion and risk man­age­ment stan­dards as banks, he added.</p>
    <p>His com­ments add to a widen­ing crack­down on fin­tech firms, which last week de­railed Ant’s US$37 bil­lion ini­tial public of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­la­tors have roiled mar­kets with a spate of new rules to curb their dom­i­nance and also tar­geted</p>
    <p>In­ter­net gi­ants such as Ten­cent Hold­ings and Alibaba Group Hold­ing, which owns a third of Ant.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, the Hang Seng Tech In­dex slumped 2.5 per cent in Hong Kong, tak­ing its two-day loss to 7.5 per cent. Shares of Alibaba Group Hold­ing, Ten­cent Hold­ings, JD.com, Meituan and Xiaomi slumped at least 5.8 per cent in the two days as well.</p>
    <p>While the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has been steadily tight­en­ing its grip on the world’s sec­ond-largest econ­omy, it has un­til re­cently taken a rel­a­tively hands-off ap­proach to­wards busi­nesses that dom­i­nate the coun­try’s bur­geon­ing In­ter­net, e-com­merce and dig­i­tal fi­nance in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are con­cerned the com­pa­nies have be­come too pow­er­ful, said Mr Ma Chen, a Bei­jing-based part­ner at Han Kun Law Of­fices. “This is a wa­ter­shed mo­ment,” said Mr Ma, who spe­cialises in an­titrust is­sues.</p>
    <p>Alibaba, Ant and Ten­cent alone com­manded a com­bined mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of nearly US$2 tril­lion be­fore last week, eas­ily sur­pass­ing state-owned be­he­moths like Bank of China as the coun­try’s most valu­able com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s sell-off sent Alibaba shares down an­other 7 per cent to the low­est since Au­gust in Hong Kong, while an­a­lysts have es­ti­mated that Ant’s US$280 bil­lion val­u­a­tion could be cut in half due to stricter reg­u­la­tions. That is af­ter Alibaba’s 5 per cent de­cline on Tues­day. Both com­pa­nies were co­founded by bil­lion­aire Jack Ma.</p>
    <p>Ten­cent, the gam­ing to pay­ments gi­ant whose rise turned co­founder Pony Ma into China’s rich­est man, fell as much as 6 per cent yes­ter­day af­ter sink­ing 4.4 per cent the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
    <p>Meituan, the food-de­liv­ery startup that has ex­panded into ho­tel book­ings and movie tick­ets, dived 6 per cent be­fore par­ing losses. It tum­bled 10.5 per cent on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>China’s an­titrust watch­dog is seek­ing feed­back on a raft of reg­u­la­tions that es­tab­lish a frame­work for curb­ing be­hav­iour such as col­lud­ing on shar­ing sen­si­tive con­sumer data, al­liances that squeeze out smaller ri­vals and sub­si­dis­ing ser­vices at be­low cost to elim­i­nate com­peti­tors.</p>
    <p>Us­ing big data gleaned from their hold on on­line pay­ments, Ant and firms such as Ten­cent have grabbed mar­ket share from com­mer­cial banks in the lu­cra­tive con­sumer lend­ing space by pro­vid­ing eas­ier ac­cess to credit for younger users on­line, many of whom have lit­tle in­come or credit his­tory.</p>
    <p>CBIRC called for bet­ter ed­u­ca­tion for bor­row­ers and bans on in­duc­ing cus­tomers to bor­row be­yond their means. In ar­eas where a mar­ket mo­nop­oly can be spot­ted, the reg­u­la­tor will step up probes to en­sure fair com­pe­ti­tion and mar­ket or­der, Mr Liang said.</p>
    <p>Li­censed fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions should also as­sess the risks of their part­ners and are re­stricted from out­sourc­ing their in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy, risk man­age­ment and in­ter­nal au­dit­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>Other speak­ers at the con­fer­ence, in­clud­ing ex­ec­u­tives from In­dus­trial and Com­mer­cial Bank of China and Bei­jing Fi­nan­cial Hold­ings Group, joined in the clam­p­down cho­rus.</p>
    <p>Mr Fang Wen­zhong, chair­man of Bei­jing Fi­nan­cial and a for­mer CBIRC di­rec­tor, said none of the fi­nan­cial in­no­va­tions has re­moved or even re­duced risks.</p>
    <p>He added that the Basel Ac­cords were not out­dated but de­vel­oped from the lessons of the past fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Those com­ments were in re­sponse to a speech late last month by Mr Jack Ma, who com­pared the Basel cap­i­tal rules to a club for the el­derly. Ant, which op­er­ates the Ali­pay pay­ments app, also spans lend­ing, as­set man­age­ment and in­sur­ance.</p>
