    <p>This year’s po­lit­i­cal con­ven­tions high­light how di­a­met­ri­cally op­posed the Demo­cratic and Repub­li­can par­ties are from each other on the most crit­i­cal is­sues fac­ing the United States.</p>
    <p>When it comes to prob­lems re­lated to racial jus­tice, im­mi­gra­tion, en­ergy and the en­vi­ron­ment, health­care and taxes, al­most no agree­ment ex­ists on how to tackle them. Nor does any agree­ment ex­ist on how to ad­dress the state of the econ­omy. As for Covid-19, Amer­i­cans view Mr Don­ald Trump’s lead­er­ship as either heroic (Repub­li­cans) or fa­tally flawed (Democrats).</p>
    <p>How­ever, in one way both par­ties are in lock­step. Each be­lieves if the other wins, the coun­try they love will no longer ex­ist. For the Democrats, four more years of a Trump pres­i­dency could de­stroy Amer­i­can democ­racy and in­crease civil un­rest. For Mr Trump’s party, a vic­tory for Mr Joe Bi­den would bring rad­i­cal so­cial­ism, the tak­ing of in­di­vid­ual lib­er­ties, and crime.</p>
    <p>THE VI­SION THING</p>
    <p>All else be­ing equal, the cam­paign that frames the over­ar­ch­ing nar­ra­tive of an elec­tion wins be­cause the can­di­date with a com­pelling nar­ra­tive drives a party’s base to vote while also at­tract­ing in­de­pen­dents and swing vot­ers.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den cam­paign came into 2020 with this nar­ra­tive-setting ad­van­tage be­cause the start­ing nar­ra­tive of a re-elec­tion cam­paign cen­tres on the re­sults of the pres­i­dent’s first term and whether he de­serves a se­cond one.</p>
    <p>With this as a bench­mark, trou­ble lies ahead for Mr Trump. He re­ceives neg­a­tive marks on his han­dling of the pan­demic and it’s al­most im­pos­si­ble for a pres­i­dent to be re-elected with an econ­omy in re­ces­sion. Ac­cord­ingly, Mr</p>
    <p>Trump’s ap­proval rat­ing re­mains below what any tra­di­tional in­cum­bent needs for re-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump was an in­sur­gent can­di­date run­ning against the es­tab­lish­ment in 2016, and his “Make Amer­ica Great Again” slo­gan res­onated while fuelling in­sur­gent sub-themes such as “Drain The Swamp” and “Build The Wall”.</p>
    <p>When run­ning for re-elec­tion, “Make Amer­ica Great Again, Again” does not work.</p>
    <p>The Democrats can frame their nar­ra­tive in any num­ber of suc­cess­ful ways, but the chal­lenge re­mains how to do so ag­gres­sively to pin their charges against Mr Trump. The Bi­den cam­paign will work to pin why the ma­jor­ity of vot­ers think the US is on the “wrong path” on Mr Trump by dis­cussing how Covid-19 runs unchecked through­out the coun­try, killing tens of thou­sands of Amer­i­cans while Mr Trump fans the flames of di­vi­sion rather than calm­ing ten­sions.</p>
    <p>DEEPEN THE BASE AND PEEL OFF A FEW DEMOCRATS</p>
    <p>For Mr Trump to win, given he has gov­erned with an eye on his core sup­port­ers, he must re­peat his suc­cess­ful 2016 strat­egy of turn­ing out his base while de­press­ing the vote of Democrats as much as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s core sup­port­ers are white men with no col­lege de­gree. He will eas­ily get those vot­ers in that de­mo­graphic who voted for him last time to do so again. But that alone may not be enough to win this time.</p>
    <p>His cam­paign has spent the past three years find­ing vot­ers sus­cep­ti­ble to his mes­sage who did not vote last time, es­pe­cially men in that de­mo­graphic, reg­is­ter­ing them and get­ting them ready to vote.</p>
    <p>At the same time, although Mr Trump’s sup­port among black vot­ers is anaemic, his cam­paign gives its rea­sons why blacks should not vote for Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“Many blacks didn’t go out to vote for Hil­lary (Clinton) ‘cause they liked me’,” Mr Trump said in a record­ing ob­tained by Politico from a meet­ing just af­ter the 2016 elec­tion. “That was al­most as good as get­ting the vote, you know, and it was great.”</p>
    <p>In an ef­fort to re­peat that per­for­mance, Team Trump made sure that last week’s Repub­li­can con­ven­tion had a slate of black speak­ers to praise Mr Trump and his ef­forts in im­prov­ing their com­mu­nity eco­nom­i­cally, thereby giv­ing a rea­son for blacks to sup­port him, or at least not sup­port the other side.</p>
    <p>SCARE THE SUB­URBS</p>
    <p>Mr Trump must keep white women, a vot­ing bloc that slightly leans Repub­li­can, to stay with him to the same ex­tent they did in 2016. In par­tic­u­lar, he needs to hold on to his 49 per cent share of col­lege-ed­u­cated white women who voted for him last time. It’s no easy task, es­pe­cially given their dis­like of his misog­y­nis­tic rhetoric.</p>
    <p>Scar­ing them into vot­ing for him may be the only way to keep a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of them on his side. Last time, he did this by por­tray­ing the US as at risk from im­mi­grants who would bring vi­o­lence and ter­ror to the coun­try if Mrs Clinton were to win.</p>
    <p>Now, Mr Trump makes the case based on the vi­o­lence he says will come from within, claim­ing:</p>
    <p>“Make no mis­take, if you give power to Joe Bi­den, the rad­i­cal left will de­fund po­lice de­part­ments all across Amer­ica. They will pass fed­eral leg­is­la­tion to re­duce law en­force­ment na­tion­wide. They will make every city look like Demo­crat-run Port­land, Ore­gon. No one will be safe in Bi­den’s Amer­ica.”</p>
    <p>And he dou­bles down on those fears with claims that only his re-elec­tion stands be­tween them and the elim­i­na­tion of their Se­cond Amend­ment gun rights.</p>
    <p>Se­na­tor Ka­mala Har­ris, Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate, recog­nises the po­ten­tial po­tency of this mes­sage, even though the vi­o­lence that oc­curs does so un­der Pres­i­dent Trump. “For some, the fear tac­tics by Trump and the Repub­li­can Party are gonna work,” she said in re­sponse to a ques­tion about Mr Trump’s use of such scare tac­tics.</p>
    <p>The Bi­den cam­paign has time to counter this nar­ra­tive by show­ing that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s ac­tions led to the civil un­rest the coun­try now faces.</p>
    <p>But cut­ting through the vi­su­als of ri­ots in the cities will not be easy for the Bi­den cam­paign to counter this ugly mes­sage, es­pe­cially if it per­sists.</p>
    <p>In one of her last in­ter­views while still in the White House, Ms Kellyanne Con­way an­a­lysed that Mr Trump ben­e­fits po­lit­i­cally from so­cial un­rest. “The more chaos and an­ar­chy and van­dal­ism and vi­o­lence reigns, the bet­ter it is for the very clear choice on who’s best on pub­lic safety and law and or­der,” she said.</p>
    <p>If the Repub­li­cans can turn this cam­paign’s fo­cus away from a ref­er­en­dum on Mr Trump’s first term and to­wards a de­bate on law en­force­ment, with their party marked as the party of “Law and Or­der”, just as Richard Nixon did in 1968, their chances for vic­tory im­prove.</p>
    <p>With the elec­toral bat­tle­field favour­ing Mr Bi­den, Mr Trump will do ev­ery­thing pos­si­ble to change the nar­ra­tive, in­clud­ing em­ploy­ing the most heated rhetoric avail­able in tweets and rally speeches.</p>
    <p>THE END OF AMER­ICA AS WE KNOW IT</p>
    <p>In the pres­i­den­tial cam­paign be­tween then se­na­tors John McCain and Barack Obama, each showed mu­tual re­spect for the other while dis­agree­ing on nearly every ma­jor pol­icy is­sue. That seems like for­ever ago.</p>
    <p>In this era of hy­per-par­ti­san­ship, the two par­ties can­not even come to­gether to pass a des­per­ately needed Covid-19 re­lief pack­age, leav­ing millions to suf­fer.</p>
    <p>At one con­ven­tion, the nom­i­nee’s ac­cep­tance speech in­cluded this: “At no time be­fore have vot­ers faced a clearer choice be­tween two par­ties, two vi­sions, two philosophi­es, or two agen­das.”</p>
    <p>At the other con­ven­tion, the nom­i­nee said: “This is a life-chang­ing elec­tion. This will de­ter­mine what Amer­ica’s go­ing to look like for a long, long time... Who we are as a na­tion, what we stand for, and most im­por­tantly, who we want to be, that’s all on the bal­lot.”</p>
    <p>You can be for­given for not be­ing able to tell which can­di­date said which. (Mr Trump de­liv­ered the former).</p>
    <p>With each party believ­ing the elec­tion out­come has such grave con­se­quences, in­tense neg­a­tive cam­paign­ing will be more than any we have wit­nessed.</p>

    <p>This cam­paign re­veals one sim­i­lar­ity, how­ever – each party agrees that if it loses it will be the end of the United States as we know it. And they will not feel fine.</p>
