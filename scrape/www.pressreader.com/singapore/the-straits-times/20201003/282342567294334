    <p>Cordlife Group’s board has backed chair­man and in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor Goh Jin Hian – amid in­ves­ti­ga­tions into the New Silkroutes Group that he re­cently ran.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh, the son of for­mer prime min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong, was chief ex­ec­u­tive of New Silkroutes un­til he quit on Thurs­day. How­ever, he re­mains the firm’s chair­man.</p>
    <p>The Com­mer­cial Af­fairs De­part­ment (CAD) is look­ing into a pos­si­ble of­fence un­der the Securities and Fu­tures Act.</p>
    <p>New Silkroutes said on Wed­nes­day that it be­lieves this in­volves false trad­ing and mar­ket rig­ging, in view of past share buy­backs and stock pur­chases.</p>
    <p>Dr Goh, 51, is one of the in­di­vid­u­als as­sist­ing the CAD.</p>
    <p>Cordlife’s board – with Dr Goh ab­stain­ing – said yes­ter­day that his as­sist­ing the probe “does not com­pro­mise his abil­ity to ful­fil his duty as the chair­man and in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor of the com­pany”, based on the in­for­ma­tion it has.</p>
    <p>It added that it will mon­i­tor the progress of the CAD in­ves­ti­ga­tion and make fur­ther an­nounce­ments if needed.</p>
    <p>The board said it will also ask Dr Goh to up­date it on the case, so it can com­ply with dis­clo­sure obli­ga­tions un­der listing rules.</p>
    <p>It noted that it be­lieves the in­ves­ti­ga­tions are not re­lated to Cordlife or its sub­sidiaries.</p>
    <p>Be­sides Dr Goh, New Silkroutes fi­nance di­rec­tor Wil­liam Teo and its for­mer chief cor­po­rate of­fi­cer Kelvyn Oo are also as­sist­ing with the in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Oo, who left New Silkroutes in Au­gust, is an in­de­pen­dent di­rec­tor of Catal­ist-listed en­ergy com­pany Teho In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>New Silkroutes ap­pointed spe­cial­ist or­tho­don­tist VicPearly Wong as its new chief ex­ec­u­tive on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Separately, the High Court has ap­proved the bid by two ma­jor bank cred­i­tors to fund In­ter-Pa­cific Petroleum’s law­suit against Dr Goh, its for­mer di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ete Gen­erale and May­bank are seek­ing to re­cover at least US$156 mil­lion (S$212.8 mil­lion) in losses they claim were a re­sult of Dr Goh’s al­leged neg­li­gence, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>New Silkroutes shares closed up 4.67 per cent at 11.2 cents yes­ter­day.</p>
