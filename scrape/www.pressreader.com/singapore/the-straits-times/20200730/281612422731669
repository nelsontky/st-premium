    <p>Mr Lawrence Wong shared his ex­pe­ri­ence of hav­ing to “scram­ble” and plug knowl­edge gaps yes­ter­day, the se­cond day of work in his role as Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter, at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity, where he launched a se­ries of vir­tual work­shops to help Sin­ga­pore­ans keep up with new work de­mands.</p>
    <p>In 1997, Mr Lawrence Wong stepped into the work­ing world, fresh out of col­lege as an eco­nom­ics grad­u­ate.</p>
    <p>“As most fresh grad­u­ates are, I was brim­ming with con­fi­dence. I thought I knew ev­ery­thing there was to know about eco­nom­ics,” said Mr Wong, who be­gan his ca­reer as a civil ser­vant at the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Then the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis struck.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Wong: “One of my first as­sign­ments was to put up a pa­per to my bosses to as­sess the im­pact on the re­gional economies and the im­pli­ca­tions for Sin­ga­pore. Noth­ing that I learnt in school pre­pared me for such an as­sign­ment.”</p>
    <p>Mr Wong talked about hav­ing to “scram­ble” and plug knowl­edge gaps yes­ter­day at Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU), where he launched Skill­sFu­ture@NTU, a se­ries of vir­tual work­shops to help Sin­ga­pore­ans keep up with new work de­mands.</p>
    <p>It was Mr Wong’s se­cond day in his new role as Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter, and his first of­fi­cial event in his new ap­point­ment.</p>
    <p>He said: “I re­alised how big a gap there was from my text­book un­der­stand­ing of eco­nom­ics and the way things work in the real world.</p>
    <p>“Since that ex­pe­ri­ence, it has been a jour­ney of con­tin­u­ous learn­ing be­cause there are many, many gaps in my knowl­edge that I still con­tinue to plug to this very day.”</p>
    <p>These in­clude keep­ing up to date on de­vel­op­ments, and pick­ing up soft skills like writ­ing pol­icy pa­pers and pre­sent­ing tech­ni­cal in­for­ma­tion to a non-tech­ni­cal au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>“As a young econ­o­mist, I learnt very quickly that how you present data and charts is quite im­por­tant. And I took a lot of time and ef­fort to im­prove my skills in do­ing these things; it’s not just about us­ing Ex­cel and Pow­erPoint,” said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>With the Covid-19 out­break, the pace of change has ac­cel­er­ated, and so has the im­pe­tus for con­tin­u­ous learn­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>Learn­ing does not stop at grad­u­a­tion, he said. “I know this is a tough pe­riod for job seek­ers, es­pe­cially for our fresh grad­u­ates who are now look­ing to en­ter the work­force.”</p>
    <p>The in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing (IHLs) have stepped up ef­forts for fresh grad­u­ates this year, he said. The sup­port in­cludes sourc­ing job open­ings and hold­ing ca­reer fairs.</p>
    <p>IHLs have a heavy re­spon­si­bil­ity in con­tin­u­ing ed­u­ca­tion and train­ing, said Mr Wong, who served at the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) from May 2011 to Novem­ber 2012, where he was Min­is­ter of State, and then Se­nior Min­is­ter of State.</p>
    <p>“For a long time, we have been try­ing to bring IHLs and in­dus­try closer to­gether,” said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>“In the past, cer­tainly in my first stint at MOE, when I asked IHLs, do you have any in­dus­try links, all of them would say ‘yes’ im­me­di­ately, we do. Then you ask in­dus­try, do you think of your links with the IHLs, and they will tell you that the IHLs tend to be a bit too aca­demic and too far re­moved from re­al­world prac­ti­cal­i­ties.”</p>
    <p>But the sit­u­a­tion has changed over the years, he said.</p>
    <p>“We see the im­por­tance of Skill­sFu­ture, even in our fight against Covid-19,” said Mr Wong, who cochairs the multi-min­istry task force tack­ling the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He said doc­tors at com­mu­nity care fa­cil­i­ties were con­cerned about the pos­si­ble spread of com­mu­ni­ca­ble dis­eases, given that so many peo­ple are housed to­gether.</p>
    <p>So, to pick up early signs of such out­breaks, a group of young doc­tors de­vel­oped their own mo­bile ap­pli­ca­tion to mon­i­tor pa­tients’ con­di­tions and symp­toms, said Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>The typ­i­cal way would be to out­source the work to an IT com­pany, he said, but these doc­tors also knew how to code, and could de­velop an app and roll it out within a few days.</p>
    <p>About 8,750 par­tic­i­pants, in­clud­ing fresh grad­u­ates and mid-ca­reer job seek­ers, took part in yes­ter­day’s event, which was or­gan­ised with Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore and sup­ported by all lo­cal uni­ver­si­ties, poly­tech­nics and the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>REAL-WORLD LESSONS</p>
    <p>Since that ex­pe­ri­ence, it has been a jour­ney of con­tin­u­ous learn­ing be­cause there are many, many gaps in my knowl­edge that I still con­tinue to plug to this ’’ very day.</p>
