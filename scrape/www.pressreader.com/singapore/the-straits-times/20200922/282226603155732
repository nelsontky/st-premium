    <p>Con­struc­tion firm Swee Hong will have to delist by to­mor­row af­ter its last ditch ap­peals to the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change for a stay of ex­e­cu­tion were re­jected.</p>
    <p>The watch-listed firm had ap­pealed against the delist­ing and asked for an ex­ten­sion of six months for it to sub­mit its re­sump­tion pro­posal.</p>
    <p>The SGX said on Sun­day night that it took into ac­count the fact that Swee Hong’s scheme of ar­range­ment ap­proved on Sept 2 would re­sult in the com­pany no longer be­ing in a net li­a­bil­ity po­si­tion on com­ple­tion of the scheme.</p>
    <p>Even ap­prov­ing the scheme would not en­able the com­pany to meet any of the ex­ten­sion cri­te­ria re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>It also noted that the firm had sub­mit­ted that in­vestor CIIC Group could pro­cure the en­try into agree­ments with large Chi­nese sta­te­owned en­ter­prises and a pub­lic listed firm to par­tic­i­pate on con­struc­tion projects here and across the re­gion.</p>
    <p>But the SGX pointed out that Swee Hong had not en­tered into fur­ther de­fin­i­tive deals or been awarded ac­tual projects.</p>
    <p>It said these deals were highly spec­u­la­tive with no cer­tainty that the com­pany would be able to se­cure any ac­tual projects.</p>
    <p>The SGX noted that as the firm op­er­ates only in Sin­ga­pore, there was no ev­i­dence that se­cur­ing such projects would en­able it to achieve prof­itabil­ity and have a market cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of at least $40 mil­lion to meet the re­quire­ments for its re­moval from the watch-list.</p>
    <p>Dis­crep­an­cies were also cited be­tween unau­dited and au­dited ac­counts, with the re­stated rev­enue for 2019 re­duced by $36 mil­lion to a neg­a­tive $11.2 mil­lion from a pre­vi­ously re­ported $25.14 mil­lion. This was due to an al­lowance for im­pair­ment loss of $32.3 mil­lion against rev­enue.</p>
    <p>There was also a sig­nif­i­cant re­duc­tion in gross rev­enue, from $25.1 mil­lion last year to $4.7 mil­lion in 2020.</p>
    <p>The com­pany gen­er­ated neg­a­tive cash flow from op­er­at­ing ac­tiv­i­ties of $5.4 mil­lion last year and $4.1 mil­lion in 2020.</p>
    <p>Swee Hong also re­ported an in­crease in its loss be­fore tax for 2019 af­ter the re­state­ment, which widened fur­ther to a loss of $57.9 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>SGX also said that Swee Hong had sub­mit­ted that if it failed to main­tain its list­ing sta­tus, there can be no as­sur­ance that the CIIC Group would con­tinue to sup­port it.</p>
    <p>Swee Hong’s board said the com­pany was not able to make any exit of­fer to share­hold­ers, given its fi­nan­cial po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Trad­ing in Swee Hong shares was sus­pended in May last year.</p>
