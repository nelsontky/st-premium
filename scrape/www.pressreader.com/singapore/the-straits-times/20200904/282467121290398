    <p>Not all di­a­monds were cre­ated equal in the Earth’s core.</p>
    <p>Size and num­ber of carats cer­tainly mat­ter, but on their own do not dic­tate rar­ity or price. Apart from the uni­ver­sally known 4Cs – colour, cut, carat and clar­ity – graded by the Ge­mo­log­i­cal In­sti­tute of Amer­ica (GIA), a wide spec­trum of char­ac­ter­is­tics in­clud­ing his­tory and crafts­man­ship also af­fects the price points for a di­a­mond, say ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Coloured di­a­monds – par­tic­u­larly blue, green, pink and red – are also rarer and typ­i­cally val­ued more than colour­less di­a­monds.</p>
    <p>And not all are for sale on the open mar­ket ei­ther. Here are some of the world’s most ex­pen­sive and prom­i­nent di­a­monds.</p>
    <p>Hope Di­a­mond (US$250 mil­lion)</p>
    <p>This 45.52-carat blue di­a­mond (above) reigns as one of the most fa­mous jew­els in the world, with a long and trou­bled his­tory and even talk of a curse.</p>
    <p>Be­lieved to have been mined in In­dia in the 1600s, it was once owned by the French royal fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Over the decades, it changed nu­mer­ous hands, be­fore Amer­i­can jew­eller Harry Win­ston pur­chased it in 1949 and later do­nated it to the Smith­so­nian In­sti­tu­tion in Washington, DC, where it re­mains on ex­hi­bi­tion to­day.</p>
    <p>The Cul­li­nan Di­a­mond (US$2 bil­lion)</p>
    <p>The record for the largest rough di­a­mond ever found goes to the mas­sive 3,106.75-carat Cul­li­nan, dis­cov­ered in the Premier Mine in Cul­li­nan, South Africa, in 1905.</p>
    <p>It has pro­duced stones of var­i­ous cuts and sizes – the most fa­mous be­ing the 530.2-carat Cul­li­nan I and 317.4-carat Cul­li­nan II (above), which are both part of the Bri­tish Crown Jew­els.</p>
    <p>The near colour­less di­a­mond in its en­tirety is es­ti­mated to be worth up to US$2 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The Cen­te­nary Di­a­mond (US$100 mil­lion)</p>
    <p>The clos­est in value to Bel­la­graph Jew­elry’s mys­tery sale, the Cen­te­nary Di­a­mond is in­sured for more than US$100 mil­lion and weighs 273.85 carats.</p>
    <p>Dis­cov­ered in the same mine in South Africa where the Cul­li­nan was found, the orig­i­nal rough di­a­mond weighed 599 carats be­fore it was care­fully cut into its cur­rent mod­i­fied heart shape. It was given a grade D colour rat­ing by the GIA – the high­est grade of colour­less di­a­mond. While it orig­i­nally be­longed to di­a­mond com­pany De Beers, its cur­rent own­er­ship re­mains a mys­tery.</p>
    <p>Pink Star Di­a­mond (US$71.2 mil­lion)</p>
    <p>Sold to Hong Kong jew­eller Chow Tai Fook in a tele­phone bid at the 2017 Sotheby’s auction in Hong Kong, this 59.6-carat beauty (above) is the largest in­ter­nally flaw­less Fancy Vivid Pink di­a­mond that the GIA has ever graded.</p>
    <p>Mined in Africa by De Beers in 1999, the rough 132.5-carat gem was first sold for a record</p>
    <p>US$83 mil­lion in 2013 at a Sotheby’s auction in Geneva. How­ever, the buyer later de­faulted on the pur­chase, re­turn­ing the gi­ant gem to Sotheby’s pos­ses­sion.</p>
    <p>To­day, it holds the record for the most ex­pen­sive gem sold at an auction.</p>
    <p>Graff Pink Di­a­mond (US$46 mil­lion)</p>
    <p>Mounted in a ring, the rare 24.78-carat pink di­a­mond (left) mined in In­dia was sold at a Sotheby’s auction in Geneva in 2010.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally es­ti­mated to fetch be­tween US$27 mil­lion and US$38 mil­lion, it sold for a record-break­ing</p>
    <p>US$46 mil­lion, mak­ing it the most ex­pen­sive sin­gle jewel ever sold at an auction at the time. It went to English jew­eller Lau­rence Graff of Graff Di­a­monds, who chris­tened it Graff Pink. Mr Graff later re­cut the stone, trim­ming it down to 23.88 carats to heighten its colour and in­ten­sity.</p>
    <p>Op­pen­heimer Blue Di­a­mond (US$57.5 mil­lion)</p>
    <p>Be­fore the 2017 sale of the Pink</p>
    <p>Star, the Op­pen­heimer Blue Di­a­mond (above) held the record for the most ex­pen­sive di­a­mond sold at an auction. It went un­der the ham­mer at a Christie’s auction in Geneva in 2016 and sold for</p>
    <p>US$57.5 mil­lion to an un­known col­lec­tor.</p>
    <p>The 14.62-carat emer­ald-cut stone is the largest Fancy Vivid Blue di­a­mond ever of­fered at auction.</p>
    <p>Mous­saieff Red Di­a­mond (US$7 mil­lion to US$8 mil­lion)</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rate from ru­bies, red di­a­monds are some of the rarest in the world. Weigh­ing at 5.11 carats, the Mous­saieff Red Di­a­mond is the largest known red di­a­mond ever graded by the GIA – and the most fa­mous too.</p>
    <p>It was dis­cov­ered in the 1990s in an un­known mine in Brazil and was pur­chased in 2001 by Is­raeli-born jew­ellery dealer Shlomo Mous­saieff of Mous­saieff Jewellers, which still owns it to­day.</p>
    <p>The tri­an­gu­lar bril­liant cut red stone is es­ti­mated to be worth</p>
    <p>US$8 mil­lion. It was ex­hib­ited at the Na­tional Mu­seum of Nat­u­ral His­tory at the Smith­so­nian In­sti­tu­tion in 2003 and 2005.</p>
