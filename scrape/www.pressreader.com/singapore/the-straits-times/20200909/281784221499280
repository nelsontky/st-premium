    <p>China is the first ma­jor econ­omy to re­sume growth since the coro­n­avirus out­break wreaked havoc world­wide, and it is paving the way in Covid-19 con­trol and eco­nomic re­cov­ery, Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping said yes­ter­day, in his most ex­ten­sive re­marks on the pan­demic yet.</p>
    <p>In a 70-minute speech trum­pet­ing his na­tion’s achieve­ments in over­com­ing the out­break, Mr Xi told an au­di­ence of top of­fi­cials, party cadres and health­care work­ers that the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party (CCP) was “the most re­li­able back­bone of the Chi­nese peo­ple when a storm hits”, and it was un­der its strong lead­er­ship that the coun­try could emerge from the dev­as­tat­ing cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi’s speech came as China main­tained a record of more than three weeks with no do­mes­tic Covid-19 cases. His com­ments also come as Sino-US re­la­tions fall to a decades-low, af­ter US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump blamed the pan­demic on China while his ad­min­is­tra­tion sought to de­monise the CCP, call­ing on Amer­i­can al­lies to stand up to “this new tyranny”.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Mr Xi praised his coun­try’s po­lit­i­cal model, say­ing the fight against the virus “has once again proven the sig­nif­i­cant ad­van­tages of the so­cial­ist sys­tem with Chi­nese char­ac­ter­is­tics in de­fend­ing risks and chal­lenges and im­prov­ing the ef­fec­tive­ness of na­tional gov­er­nance”.</p>
    <p>“An im­por­tant as­pect of mea­sur­ing the suc­cess and su­pe­ri­or­ity of a coun­try’s sys­tem is to see whether it can give or­ders from all sides and or­gan­ise all par­ties to cope with ma­jor risks and chal­lenges,” he added.</p>
    <p>China’s “so­cial­ist sys­tem has ex­tra­or­di­nary or­gan­i­sa­tional and mo­bil­i­sa­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties, over­all plan­ning and co­or­di­na­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties and im­ple­men­ta­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties”.</p>
    <p>He did not ad­dress short­com­ings in China’s han­dling of the out­break, which had caused much un­hap­pi­ness in the early days, es­pe­cially af­ter the death of Dr Li Wen­liang, a Wuhan doc­tor who was sanc­tioned for warn­ing last De­cem­ber about the then-mys­te­ri­ous dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s cer­e­mony, held at the Great Hall of the Peo­ple in Bei</p>
    <p>jing, was meant to laud those who had con­trib­uted to China’s fight in the Covid-19 war.</p>
    <p>Mr Xi con­ferred the Medal of the Repub­lic, the high­est na­tional hon­our, on well-known res­pi­ra­tory dis­ease ex­pert Zhong Nan­shan.</p>
    <p>He also pre­sented awards to three other “na­tional he­roes”: tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine ex­pert Zhang Boli, Wuhan hos­pi­tal chief Zhang Dingyu and mil­i­tary med­i­cal doc­tor Chen Wei, who led re­search and devel­op­ment into vac­cines and treat­ment.</p>
    <p>More than 2,000 health­care work­ers, po­lice of­fi­cers, san­i­ta­tion work­ers and vol­un­teers were also hon­oured at the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic rages on i n other parts of the world, China has gone for more than three weeks with no do­mes­tic cases. Since the out­break started in the cen­tral city</p>
    <p>of Wuhan last De­cem­ber, it has recorded just over 85,000 cases and 4,634 deaths.</p>
    <p>More than 27 mil­lion cases world­wide have been recorded so far, with nearly 900,000 deaths.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial news agency Xin­hua yes­ter­day ran a glow­ing spe­cial re­port in English, ti­tled Chron­i­cle Of Xi’s Lead­er­ship In China’s War Against Coro­n­avirus, say­ing the Chi­nese leader “did not sleep well on Chi­nese New Year’s Eve as he shoul­dered the heavy re­spon­si­bil­ity to fight the epi­demic”.</p>
    <p>China has also helped to save tens of thou­sands of lives around the world, and showed its sin­cer­ity in pro­mot­ing the com­mon good, said Mr Xi in his speech.</p>
    <p>In an ap­par­ent dig at the United States, the Chi­nese leader called for global unity and co­op­er­a­tion in deal­ing with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Any prac­tice that is self­ish, that blames oth­ers, re­verses right and wrong, and con­fuses black with white will not only cause harm to the coun­try and its peo­ple, but also to the peo­ple of the world.”</p>
    <p>The US has come un­der fire for with­draw­ing from the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion, the United Na­tions health body lead­ing the global re­sponse to the out­break.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese state me­dia has, af­ter Mr Trump be­gan call­ing the coro­n­avirus the “Wuhan virus” and the “Chi­nese virus”, rou­tinely re­ported the mis­han­dling of the pan­demic and the soar­ing num­ber of in­fec­tions and deaths in the US.</p>
    <p>Nearly 200,000 peo­ple have died in the US, which has recorded over six mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>Turn­ing to do­mes­tic chal­lenges, Mr Xi urged of­fi­cials and party cadres to de­velop a long-term strat</p>
    <p>egy to deal with the coro­n­avirus, while the coun­try pow­ers on with its eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>He said: “We must in­crease our con­fi­dence and en­thu­si­asm, and strive to re­gain the lost time and make up for the losses caused by the epi­demic.”</p>
    <p>China’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct grew by a stronger-than-ex­pected 3.2 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter of this year from a year ear­lier, mak­ing it the world’s first ma­jor econ­omy to re­bound pos­i­tively af­ter the coro­n­avirus pan­demic struck.</p>
    <p>It has also been the world’s largest provider of Covid-19-re­lated med­i­cal sup­plies, ex­port­ing 209,000 ven­ti­la­tors, 1.4 bil­lion pro­tec­tive suits and 151.5 bil­lion masks be­tween March 15 and Sept 6, said Mr Xi.</p>
