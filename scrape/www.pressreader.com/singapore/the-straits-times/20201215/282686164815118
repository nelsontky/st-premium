    <p>Hong Kong ac­tor-direc­tor Stephen Chow was in the news re­cently af­ter he tes­ti­fied in a law­suit brought against him by his for­mer girl­friend Alice Yu, who had ac­cused him of fail­ing to pay her com­mis­sion of more than HK$70 mil­lion (S$12 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>Vet­eran Hong Kong ac­tress-host Carol Cheng, 63, took the chance to clear the air about a long-held mis­con­cep­tion about her look­ing down on Chow, 58.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the ru­mour, Cheng had re­port­edly told Chow years ago, be­fore he had made it big, that he would never be­come a lead­ing ac­tor. Both were re­port­edly not on talk­ing terms for many years as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Cheng clar­i­fied re­cently that she had never said such a thing to Chow.</p>
    <p>On her ra­dio show When I Was Young I Lis­ten To The Ra­dio, Cheng took the ini­tia­tive to ad­dress the ru­mour with­out be­ing prompted.</p>
    <p>Cheng – once termed one of the four pil­lars of broad­caster TVB, to­gether with Liza Wang, Nancy Sit and the late Ly­dia Sum – said she al­ready ad­mired Chow’s tal­ent when he was host­ing the chil­dren’s show 430 Space Shut­tle (1982 to 1989).</p>
    <p>Cheng and Chow acted to­gether in the tele­vi­sion se­rial The Price Of Grow­ing Up (1987), which also starred Alex Man, Fran­cis Ng and Kathy Chow.</p>
    <p>Cheng said she did not of­ten chat with Chow in pri­vate, but once when they were wait­ing to film a scene, Chow asked her if he had any fu­ture in act­ing.</p>
    <p>Cheng, who was al­ready a star at that time af­ter act­ing in se­ri­als such as The Good, The Bad And The Ugly (1979 to 1980) and The Feud Of Two Broth­ers (1985 to 1986), re­mem­bered telling Chow: “You have the po­ten­tial, work hard.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ver­sion of her com­ments re­ported in the me­dia was “You may as well don’t do it”, with the me­dia say­ing that Cheng looked down on Chow.</p>
    <p>Cheng said she was still an­gry with the mag­a­zine which first re­ported the ru­mour, for not check­ing with her be­fore it car­ried the news.</p>
    <p>Chow left TVB later and Cheng re­called only work­ing with him one more time. She said there was no need for her to ex­plain to Chow back then as she was mis­quoted by the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Af­ter leav­ing TVB, Chow went on to be­come an es­tab­lished comic ac­tor in movies such as Fight Back To School (1991), For­bid­den City Cop (1996) and King Of Com­edy (1999).</p>
    <p>He l ater went into di­rect­ing, win­ning Best Direc­tor for Kung Fu Hus­tle (2004) at the Golden Horse Awards and di­rect­ing other movies such as CJ7 (2008) and The Mer­maid (2016).</p>
