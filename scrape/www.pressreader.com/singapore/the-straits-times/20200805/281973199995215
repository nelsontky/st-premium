    <p>On June 1, 2018, I was in­vited by the In­ter­na­tional In­sti­tute for Strate­gic Stud­ies, the or­gan­iser of the Shangri-La Di­a­logue, to speak at a special ses­sion en­ti­tled Com­pe­ti­tion And Co­op­er­a­tion In China-In­dia Re­la­tions, right be­fore In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s key­note speech. The other pan­el­list was Mr Ram Madhav, the na­tional gen­eral sec­re­tary of</p>
    <p>In­dia’s Bharatiya Janata Party.</p>
    <p>I was sur­prised to find how we both fo­cused on co­op­er­a­tion rather than com­pe­ti­tion as if the dif­fer­ent speeches were writ­ten by the same per­son.</p>
    <p>But what hap­pened on June 15 this year at Gal­wan Val­ley along the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol (LAC) be­tween China and In­dia is a far dif­fer­ent story. Fol­low­ing tense mil­i­tary stand-offs since April, a brawl in­volv­ing fists, rocks and wooden clubs be­tween Chi­nese and In­dian sol­diers left 20 In­dian ser­vice­men dead.</p>
    <p>With­out men­tion­ing the num­ber of its own ca­su­al­ties, China stressed that the Gal­wan Val­ley was lo­cated on the Chi­nese side of the LAC. It added that the trig­ger for the brawl was tres­pass­ing by In­dian bor­der troops into China’s ter­ri­tory to build for­ti­fi­ca­tion and bar­ri­cades.</p>
    <p>The In­dian side claimed it was the Chi­nese who were the tres­passers.</p>
    <p>A root cause of the prob­lem is the fuzzy na­ture of the LAC. It is not sur­pris­ing then that bound­ary dis­putes have flared up on sev­eral oc­ca­sions since the 1980s, al­though none has been as deadly as the June en­counter.</p>
    <p>It’s fair to say that both gov­ern­ments have made great ef­forts in avoid­ing con­flict. Since 1993, at least five bor­der agree­ments have been made, both at gov­ern­men­tal and mil­i­tary lev­els, to­wards this end. But as al­ways the chal­lenge re­mains the lack of a com­monly agreed LAC.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the 1993 agree­ment states: “No ac­tiv­i­ties of ei­ther side shall over­step the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol. In case per­son­nel of one side cross the Line of Ac­tual Con­trol, upon be­ing cau­tioned by the other side, they shall im­me­di­ately pull back to their own side.”</p>
    <p>But how can they pull back to their side of the LAC if they don’t even know where the line ac­tu­ally lies?</p>
    <p>TWO DIF­FER­ENT AP­PROACHES</p>
    <p>Such a Catch-22 sit­u­a­tion is in part the re­sult of the dif­fer­ent ap­proaches taken by China and In­dia to re­solve the bor­der prob­lem. Bei­jing’s way is to pro­pose that both sides should, as a start­ing point, agree to the gen­eral prin­ci­ple of mu­tual ac­com­mo­da­tion of the dis­puted ter­ri­to­ries be­fore ver­i­fy­ing the align­ment of the LAC; New Delhi’s ap­proach is more bot­tom-up, that is, to ver­ify the</p>
    <p>LAC first be­fore talk­ing about any­thing else.</p>
    <p>Seen from the per­spec­tive of op­pos­ing ap­proaches, it ex­plains why so far ne­go­ti­a­tions over the LAC have made lit­tle head­way.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, it ex­plains why New Delhi has shown no in­ter­est in ne­go­ti­a­tions, say, over Arunachal Pradesh that is al­ready un­der In­dia’s con­trol, but claimed by Bei­jing as Chi­nese ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>The only achieve­ment seems to be a tacit un­der­stand­ing to not shoot at each other un­der any cir­cum­stances.</p>
    <p>As Mr Modi noted in an in­ter­view with the Hin­dus­tan Times two years ago: “Over the last four decades, not a sin­gle bul­let has been fired across the In­dia-China bor­der.”</p>
    <p>But if the in­tent of the “no-shoot­ing” guide­line is to avoid es­ca­la­tion to a deadly con­flict, then the fa­tal Gal­wan Val­ley episode has greatly un­der­mined that un­der­stand­ing. It is sad to see the two largest armed forces in Asia, in an at­tempt to avoid shoot­ing, turn in­stead to the most prim­i­tive meth­ods of fist fights and stone throw­ing. Iron­i­cally, the sol­diers in­volved could very well have been the same peo­ple who in the past would have hap­pily joined the other side for na­tional day or armed forces day cel­e­bra­tions, de­spite the bor­der dis­putes.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent pro­vides a chance to re­con­sider what mea­sures both sides have to take to avoid con­flicts. This might in­clude keep­ing a safe dis­tance from each other, not build­ing fa­cil­i­ties on ter­ri­to­ries taken by the other side as its own and es­tab­lish­ing hot­lines be­tween their mil­i­tary com­mands that are crit­i­cal in a cri­sis.</p>
    <p>CHI­NESE VIEWS ON IN­DIA</p>
    <p>What are the take­aways and big­ger is­sues raised by the deadly brawl in the Gal­wan Val­ley?</p>
    <p>For Bei­jing, it is the lat­est of re­cent in­ci­dents that leaves it won­der­ing about In­dia’s chang­ing at­ti­tudes to­wards China and where the grow­ing an­i­mus might lead.</p>
    <p>Prior to this, there was the 2017 mil­i­tary stand-off over Chi­nese con­struc­tion of a road in Dok­lam near a tri­junc­tion bor­der area, known as Donglang in Chi­nese. Even if In­dia be­lieves Dok­lam is Bhutanese rather than Chi­nese ter­ri­tory as China claims, it should not step into a face-off with China on for­eign ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>When asked what lessons In­dia might learn from the Dok­lam stand-off that lasted 73 days, then De­fence Min­is­ter Arun Jait­ley said: “In­dia of 2017 is dif­fer­ent from In­dia of 1962.”</p>
    <p>A Chi­nese spokesman’s pithy re­ply: “So is China.”</p>
    <p>The re­lated ques­tion is, to what ex­tent will In­dia side with the United States, which has clearly marked China as its pri­mary strate­gic com­peti­tor?</p>
    <p>Al­though In­dia is said to pur­sue a for­eign pol­icy of non-al­liance, it has in re­cent years been shift­ing ever closer to the US. In­dia is part of the so-called “Quad” – a group that in­cludes the US, Aus­tralia and Ja­pan. None of the Quad mem­bers would ad­mit it is against China, but their pro­mo­tion of a free and open Indo-Pa­cific is a thin veil of their true in­tent.</p>
    <p>At the Raisina Di­a­logue in</p>
    <p>New Delhi in Jan­uary last year, a Chi­nese scholar asked the In­dian pan­el­lists if in­deed the Indo-Pa­cific was free and open, could the Quad ac­cept China as a mem­ber? The re­sponse was a burst of laugh­ter from the au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>So, China has to ask it­self, if the US grows ever more hos­tile, how will the Quad evolve? And what role will In­dia play in it?</p>
    <p>Some In­dian strate­gists have long sug­gested that China wants to “en­cir­cle” In­dia from the bor­der in the north and the In­dian Ocean in the south and per­haps, with the help of Pak­istan. Such wor­ries, fu­elled by a con­cern that China may even­tu­ally es­tab­lish “a string of pearls” of mil­i­tary bases in the In­dian Ocean, have grown par­tic­u­larly wild af­ter the Chi­nese navy started anti-piracy pa­trols in the Gulf of Aden and the So­mali Basin at the end of 2008.</p>
    <p>There is no need for China to en­cir­cle In­dia. China’s econ­omy is five times larger than In­dia’s.</p>
    <p>Un­like the In­dian de­fence in­dus­try, the Chi­nese de­fence in­dus­try is ca­pa­ble of in­dige­nously pro­duc­ing al­most ev­ery­thing the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA) wants. In terms of over­all mil­i­tary strength, the PLA that is try­ing to catch up with the US can only leave the In­dian mil­i­tary fur­ther be­hind.</p>
    <p>The string of pearls was par­tic­u­larly well-re­ceived in the In­dian me­dia. But 15 years af­ter the term was first coined, in 2005, the much-hyped gar­rote is nowhere to be seen – there is just one Chi­nese lo­gis­tics base in Dji­bouti and that was built in 2017, in sup­port of its counter-piracy op­er­a­tions in the In­dian Ocean.</p>
    <p>Both China and In­dia de­scribe them­selves as de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. For China, no ob­jec­tive is more as­pi­ra­tional than re­al­is­ing “the great re­ju­ve­na­tion of the Chi­nese na­tion”. This, de­scribed as “China’s dream”, is sim­i­lar to the Modi gov­ern­ment’s New In­dia blue­print. It is also in­ter­est­ing to see China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive go west, while In­dia’s Act East plan ex­tends to the east.</p>
    <p>The brawl in the Gal­wan Val­ley is un­for­tu­nate, but it should not be seen as some kind of wa­ter­shed that re­de­fines China-In­dia ties for the worse. Rather, it works bet­ter as a use­ful re­minder: Be­fore the dragon and the ele­phant fig­ure out a way to stay in the same room, the art of co­ex­is­tence is to keep a safe dis­tance.</p>
