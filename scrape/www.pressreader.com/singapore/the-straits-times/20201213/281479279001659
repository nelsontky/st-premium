    <p>When Daren Tang was pack­ing to move from Sin­ga­pore to Switzer­land for his new job post­ing, he de­cided to ship his trusted Yamaha pi­ano along as well.</p>
    <p>Mu­sic – in par­tic­u­lar, jazz – is a big love for the lawyer who made his­tory when he be­came the first Sin­ga­porean to head a United Na­tions agency.</p>
    <p>An­other pas­sion, not quite as lyri­cal, but with a con­nec­tion to mu­sic, is in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty (IP).</p>
    <p>In Oc­to­ber, Mr Tang took up the po­si­tion of di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the World In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Or­gan­i­sa­tion (Wipo), which is head­quar­tered in Geneva.</p>
    <p>Wipo is one of the United Na­tions’ 15 spe­cialised agen­cies. Oth­ers in­clude the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and In­ter­na­tional Civil Avi­a­tion Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The agency cur­rently has 193 mem­ber states, in­clud­ing the United States and China. Among other things, it en­sures the pro­tec­tion of IP and also the use of IP to sup­port in­no­va­tion and cre­ativ­ity to ben­e­fit the world.</p>
    <p>Prior to this, Mr Tang was chief ex­ec­u­tive of the In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty Of­fice of Sin­ga­pore (Ipos), a statu­tory board which helps in­no­va­tors use IP to take their ideas to mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In that role, Mr Tang had served on a com­mit­tee at Wipo. With Aus­tralian lawyer Fran­cis Gurry re­tir­ing as Wipo di­rec­tor-gen­eral this year, Sin­ga­pore nom­i­nated Mr Tang for the top job.</p>
    <p>This was ap­proved by Wipo’s gen­eral as­sem­bly in a closely watched race. Other coun­tries, in­clud­ing China, had also of­fered can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>We’re meet­ing vir­tu­ally in late Novem­ber. The time dif­fer­ence means he will be hav­ing lunch while I will be eat­ing din­ner.</p>
    <p>His peo­ple have ar­ranged for him to do a Zoom call from Wipo’s im­pres­sive stu­dio, com­plete with three cam­era an­gles and a vir­tual back­drop show­ing a sunny Alpine scene of moun­tains and lake. I’m told it’s a pho­to­graph of what he sees from his of­fice win­dow.</p>
    <p>I’m calling in from The Straits Times’ recre­ation room in our much less pic­turesque news­room in Toa Payoh.</p>
    <p>He ap­pears on screen at our ar­ranged time and set­tles into the stu­dio chair. You have a nice view from your of­fice, I re­mark.</p>
    <p>“But to­day it’s not sunny and bril­liant like that,” he laughs, re­fer­ring to the vir­tual back­drop. “To­day is cloudy and foggy. The tem­per­a­ture is about 5 deg C.”</p>
    <p>Over the com­puter screen 10,482km away, the 48-year-old is ami­able – “call me Daren” – and has the care­ful, cour­te­ous man­ner one of­ten sees in a diplo­mat.</p>
    <p>He’s hav­ing cream of pump­kin soup. It’s what he nor­mally has over there – “it’s con­ve­nient and it keeps me warm”. To add a Swiss touch, there’s a plate of Swiss choco­lates.</p>
    <p>I’ve de­cided to go Swiss my­self with a fon­due. I’d gone to Carousell to buy a mini fon­due set. It’s filled with a gruyere cheese dip I made, and I’ve also pre­pared a plate of bread, veg­eta­bles and fruit.</p>
    <p>“Bon ap­petit,” he says.</p>
    <p>GO WITH THE FLOW</p>
    <p>His Wipo role wasn’t some­thing he had fore­seen. “I don’t try to struc­ture my life in a very planned way,” he says.</p>
    <p>He has a go-with-the-flow at­ti­tude, and this has given him space to en­joy dif­fer­ent ex­pe­ri­ences.</p>
    <p>What he has dis­cov­ered is that “later on in life, all those past ex­pe­ri­ences will en­rich you and put you in a po­si­tion where you can do your cur­rent work in the best pos­si­ble way”.</p>
    <p>He grew up in a four-room flat in Com­mon­wealth Av­enue West. His fa­ther, now 74, is Eurasian-Per­anakan. He was a busi­ness­man and ran a den­tal stu­dio that made den­tures, and is now a tour guide.</p>
    <p>His house­wife mother, who died 18 years ago, was Can­tonese, and he has a younger brother in the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Tang says he’s grate­ful for his mul­ti­cul­tural her­itage. “My dad’s side, they en­joy life, and from my mum’s side, I got the dis­ci­pline and the com­mit­ment to study­ing and all that. So it’s the best of both worlds.”</p>
    <p>An­other ad­van­tage of his back­ground is how he grew up with lots of good food from both sides of the fam­ily.</p>
    <p>One of the things he and his well­ness con­sul­tant wife made sure to take along to Geneva was ikan bilis for mak­ing soup, and an­other was chicken pow­der for use in stir-fry­ing. He has three chil­dren – daugh­ters aged 20 and 10, and an 18-year-old son.</p>
    <p>He stud­ied at Henry Park Pri­mary, then Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion, where he was in the scouts, and Raf­fles Ju­nior Col­lege.</p>
    <p>He was al­ways in­ter­ested in mu­sic and had pi­ano lessons, although he found mu­sic much more en­joy­able with­out a teacher and ex­ams.</p>
    <p>Jazz has been a large part of his life, and he helped start the NUS Jazz Band when he was study­ing law at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He’s also a found­ing mem­ber of the Thomson Jazz Club and Thomson Jazz Band. “I don’t think I stud­ied very much in law school,” he says with a chuckle.</p>
    <p>A law school­mate re­mem­bers him in the fac­ulty band. “In be­tween Madonna’s Like A Vir­gin and Ma­te­rial Girl, he would qui­etly run through bits of jazz stan­dards. I never quite found out if he was amus­ing or con­sol­ing him­self. But there he was, a gifted jazz pi­anist play­ing rock and metal at boozy fac­ulty jam and hops.”</p>
    <p>The school­mate also re­mem­bers Mr Tang’s dry and la­conic sense of hu­mour “plus a first-class poker face, so you can never quite tell when he is pulling your leg”.</p>
    <p>“He’ll be go­ing on about some­thing very se­ri­ous, like the Pelo­pon­nesian War, in that very se­ri­ous way of his and ev­ery­body will be lis­ten­ing in­tently. And just when ev­ery­one is com­pletely hooked, he will sud­denly start guf­faw­ing. That’s when you re­alise you’ve just been pranked by Daren.”</p>
    <p>At NUS, he did con­sti­tu­tional law and in­ter­na­tional law – not IP law – and thought he would en­ter pri­vate prac­tice.</p>
    <p>In his third year, he went on an ex­change pro­gramme at McGill Univer­sity in Mon­treal for a year. He had an amaz­ing time there, but when he re­turned to his fi­nal year, all the pupil­lage places at law firms had been given out.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t re­ally have that many choices left. So I thought, why not join the Gov­ern­ment? It’s go­ing to be an in­ter­est­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.”</p>
    <p>He joined the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, was a deputy pub­lic pros­e­cu­tor for a while, then trans­ferred to the in­ter­na­tional af­fairs di­vi­sion, where he later be­came se­nior state coun­sel.</p>
    <p>He was posted to the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try to help ne­go­ti­ate the US-Sin­ga­pore Free Trade Agree­ment (FTA), and was also part of the le­gal team which ar­gued Sin­ga­pore’s case in the dis­pute with Malaysia over the sovereignt­y of Pe­dra Branca.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with ex­pe­ri­enced diplo­mats and civil ser­vants gave him a “broader, more holis­tic view of the law”, he says.</p>
    <p>The ex­pe­ri­ences also taught him about diplo­macy, man­ag­ing re­la­tion­ships and un­der­stand­ing geopol­i­tics – all of which have come in use­ful.</p>
    <p>In 2012, he moved to Ipos as deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive. “That started my ar­ranged mar­riage with IP, but I’ve gone on to fall in love with it quite deeply”, is how he puts it. He be­came chief ex­ec­u­tive in 2015.</p>
    <p>CRE­AT­ING JOBS</p>
    <p>Mr Tang will be the first to agree that IP is not a topic peo­ple find ex­cit­ing. Most see it in le­gal tech­ni­cal terms, like trade­marks, copy­right and patents.</p>
    <p>“But when you see it in its broader con­text, when you see how it im­pacts our lives, it sud­denly be­comes alive,” he says.</p>
    <p>He de­clares, with feel­ing: “I don’t talk about patents, I talk about tech­nol­ogy. I don’t talk about trade­marks, I talk about brands. I don’t talk about in­dus­trial de­signs, I talk about de­sign and pack­ag­ing. I don’t talk about copy­right, I talk about con­tent.”</p>
    <p>IP cre­ates jobs, drives en­ter­prise growth and spurs eco­nomic devel­op­ment. He points out how Sin­ga­pore house­hold names like Ya Kun Kaya Toast have been able to make it over­seas be­cause they are pro­tected by trade­mark.</p>
    <p>He refers to how Sin­ga­pore’s ST Engi­neer­ing came up with the Air+ Smart mask, which has a unique mi­croven­ti­la­tor. IP al­lows the in­ven­tion to be sold glob­ally and pro­tected from be­ing copied.</p>
    <p>The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has also am­pli­fied the rel­e­vance of IP.</p>
    <p>The Ger­man com­pany BioNTech, which worked with Pfizer to push out a Covid-19 vac­cine, has filed close to 70 patents us­ing Wipo’s and other sys­tems, he says.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, Asia has be­come a big driver of IP, and not just North-east Asia but also</p>
    <p>South-east and South Asia, like in Viet­nam and In­dia. Six out of 10 IP fil­ings with Wipo now come from Asia, com­pared with four out of 10, 20 years ago.</p>
    <p>“You see more and more coun­tries look­ing at in­no­va­tion as a way of driv­ing eco­nomic growth.”</p>
    <p>His term at Wipo, which has 1,500 em­ploy­ees and a bi­en­nial bud­get of about $1 bil­lion, is for six years.</p>
    <p>It comes at a time of con­tin­u­ing US-China ten­sions. The pan­demic and race to de­velop vac­cines and treat­ments have also resur­faced is­sues like phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal mo­nop­o­lies, IP pro­tec­tion and wider pub­lic ac­cess to medicine.</p>
    <p>I ask what’s on his to-do list. He has many and lists them all, but high up there is to help in­no­va­tors and creators take their ideas to mar­ket.</p>
    <p>What does be­ing a Sin­ga­porean bring to his UN role?</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, he says, does well in world rank­ings on IP sys­tems. “We are re­garded highly for the devel­op­ment of our IP sys­tems, so we are seen as be­ing tech­ni­cally com­pe­tent in this area.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is also viewed as a very neu­tral party that is a bridge builder be­tween dif­fer­ent coun­tries.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic’s multi-eth­nic back­ground – and his own – al­lows him to con­nect to dif­fer­ent parts of the world too.</p>
    <p>Any down­sides?</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore­ans some­times think that the tech­ni­cal so­lu­tion is the only facet of a prob­lem, and that once you ar­rive at a good tech­ni­cal so­lu­tion, the prob­lem can get solved,” he of­fers.</p>
    <p>“We tend to for­get that the re­la­tional as­pects are very im­por­tant. We tend to down­play the po­lit­i­cal parts of it. That, I think, needs to be ad­justed.”</p>
    <p>His back­ground in in­ter­na­tional work, how­ever, has taught him the re­quire­ments needed of a leader op­er­at­ing on the world stage.</p>
    <p>Am­bas­sador-at-large Tommy Koh says Mr Tang was an “out­stand­ing col­league” when they worked on Pe­dra Branca and the US-Sin­ga­pore FTA.</p>
    <p>“He is a good lawyer, a good diplo­mat, a good team player and a con­cil­ia­tor. I am con­fi­dent that he would be a very suc­cess­ful di­rec­tor-gen­eral of Wipo and bring great credit to Sin­ga­pore,” Pro­fes­sor Koh tells me when I ask for a quote.</p>
    <p>Mr Tang and I wrap up the meal and he heads for more meet­ings. His days have been packed since he ar­rived and, no, he hasn’t had time to play his pi­ano.</p>
    <p>We aren’t able to take a por­trait of him, so his of­fice gets a photo done and e-mails it to me.</p>
    <p>I couldn’t tell from our Zoom call, but be­neath his suit he has on cheeky, mul­ti­coloured socks.</p>
    <p>I write to thank him for the photo and ask: Are colour­ful socks a trade­mark?</p>
    <p>“Ha­haha,” comes his e-mail re­ply. “It wasn’t de­lib­er­ate, but a bit of flair does no harm at all in an agency that sup­ports in­no­va­tors and creators!”</p>
