    <p>Den­tist Daniel Liew Yaox­i­ang, who is serv­ing a jail term for his role in a Medis­ave scam, has been struck off the of­fi­cial den­tal reg­is­ter after a dis­ci­plinary in­quiry by the Sin­ga­pore Den­tal Coun­cil (SDC).</p>
    <p>He will not be able to prac­tise after he is re­leased from pri­son.</p>
    <p>The den­tist pro­fes­sional watch­dog said yes­ter­day that it held a dis­ci­plinary in­quiry on July 27 and Aug 12 against Liew, who pre­vi­ously prac­tised at The Smile Di­vi­sion Den­tal Group.</p>
    <p>Liew, a for­mer na­tional swim­mer, faced seven charges un­der the Den­tal Reg­is­tra­tion Act for hav­ing been con­victed here of of­fences in­volv­ing dis­hon­esty.</p>
    <p>He had con­spired to cheat the Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) Board of monies from the CPF ac­counts of pa­tients for treat­ments that were not performed. Liew pleaded guilty to all seven charges.</p>
    <p>The dis­ci­plinary com­mit­tee noted that Liew’s con­duct and con­vic­tions had brought dis­hon­our to the den­tal pro­fes­sion.</p>
    <p>On Aug 12, it or­dered that Liew be re­moved from the den­tal reg­is­ter and that he had to pay the costs and ex­penses of and in­ci­den­tal to the pro­ceed­ings, in­clud­ing costs of coun­sel to the SDC.</p>
    <p>Liew’s re­moval from the Reg­is­ter of Den­tists took ef­fect yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The SDC urged all den­tal pro­fes­sion­als to be cog­nisant of the laws and reg­u­la­tions gov­ern­ing den­tal prac­tices, and to com­ply with the pro­vi­sions of the code of ethics of the pro­fes­sion as well as di­rec­tives and guide­lines is­sued by the Health Min­istry.</p>
    <p>In May last year, Liew was sen­tenced to two years’ jail for scam­ming 13 pa­tients of $388,700. Two oth­ers in­volved in the scam have also been jailed.</p>
    <p>Steven Ang Kiam Hau, the den­tist who de­vised the scheme, was jailed for 21/ years in Au­gust 2018 and</p>
    <p>2 struck off the den­tal reg­is­ter last Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>Yeo Meow Koon, a clinic’s prac­tice man­ager, was jailed for 48 weeks in June this year.</p>
    <p>The case of an­other al­leged ac­com­plice, den­tist Ce­cil Goh Chin Chye, is still pend­ing.</p>
