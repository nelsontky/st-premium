    <p>Stu­dents in Sin­ga­pore know more about is­sues like cli­mate change and global warm­ing but lack knowl­edge in other ar­eas like in­ter­na­tional con­flicts.</p>
    <p>More than eight in 10 of them said they felt con­fi­dent ex­plain­ing is­sues re­lated to global cli­mate change. These in­clude, for in­stance, the im­pact of car­bon diox­ide emis­sions and why some coun­tries suf­fer from cli­mate change more than oth­ers.</p>
    <p>This is higher than the Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion and De­vel­op­ment (OECD) av­er­age of about six to seven in 10 stu­dents.</p>
    <p>This was one of the main find­ings re­leased yes­ter­day from the global com­pe­tence seg­ment of the Pro­gramme for In­ter­na­tional Stu­dent Assess­ment (Pisa), an in­ter­na­tional bench­mark­ing study con­ducted by the OECD.</p>
    <p>About 6,670 stu­dents in Sin­ga­pore took part in the study in 2018. They were then 15 years old.</p>
    <p>While they fared well in their knowl­edge of cli­mate change, they were less fa­mil­iar with other top­ics, just like their OECD peers.</p>
    <p>Some 66 per cent of the Sin­ga­pore stu­dents said they knew some­thing about in­ter­na­tional con­flicts and could ex­plain it to some ex­tent. And 64 per cent re­ported the same for global health is­sues such as epi­demics.</p>
    <p>More than 70 per cent of stu­dents here said they were fa­mil­iar with world is­sues like hunger or mal­nu­tri­tion, and the causes of poverty.</p>
    <p>How­ever, they were also less cer­tain when ex­plain­ing mat­ters re­lated to the global econ­omy.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, only about half of them could “es­tab­lish a con­nec­tion be­tween prices of tex­tiles and work­ing con­di­tions in the coun­tries of pro­duc­tion”. The OECD av­er­age was 58 per cent.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the find­ings, the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE) said: “Through sub­jects such as sci­ence, ge­og­ra­phy and so­cial stud­ies, our stu­dents are ex­posed to top­ics like cli­mate change, the driv­ing forces of glob­al­i­sa­tion, and racial or re­li­gious con­flicts.”</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it will con­tinue to en­cour­age stu­dents to read widely, so that they gain a bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of global is­sues and deeper ap­pre­ci­a­tion of dif­fer­ent per­spec­tives and cul­tures.</p>
    <p>As part of next year’s re­freshed char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion cur­ricu­lum, dis­cus­sions of con­tem­po­rary is­sues will be in­cluded in lessons, it added.</p>
    <p>Across the sci­ences, stu­dents will deepen their un­der­stand­ing of global and na­tional health is­sues, such as di­a­betes, air pol­lu­tion and the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In hu­man­i­ties, stu­dents now learn about is­sues re­lated to global health.</p>
    <p>From next year, the re­vised syl­labuses will see ge­og­ra­phy stu­dents study­ing is­sues re­lated to sus­tain­able de­vel­op­ment, such as the health and well-be­ing of world pop­u­la­tions.</p>
    <p>English lan­guage and mother tongue lan­guage teach­ers are also en­cour­aged to use news and cur­rent af­fairs to en­gage stu­dents, said MOE.</p>
    <p>The Pisa 2018 study also un­cov­ered other find­ings, one of which was that Sin­ga­pore stu­dents re­ported be­ing less able to adapt to new sit­u­a­tions or chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Only half of them said that they can deal with unusual sit­u­a­tions, com­pared with the OECD av­er­age of 59 per cent.</p>
    <p>North Mace­do­nia, a coun­try in south-east Europe, had the high­est pro­por­tion of stu­dents – 79 per cent – who said they were able to han­dle unusual sit­u­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­lar to their OECD peers, about half of stu­dents in Sin­ga­pore said they could ad­just to a new cul­ture, while 55 per cent of them in­di­cated that they could adapt to dif­fer­ent sit­u­a­tions even when un­der stress or pres­sure.</p>
    <p>The MOE said that Pisa 2018 noted that stu­dents who are bet­ter able to adapt to novel or chal­leng­ing sit­u­a­tions tend to be more re­silient. The min­istry added that it will con­tinue to work on build­ing con­fi­dence in stu­dents as they face chal­lenges, through learn­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties such as char­ac­ter and cit­i­zen­ship ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>EX­POSED TO DIF­FER­ENT TOP­ICS Through sub­jects such as sci­ence, ge­og­ra­phy and so­cial stud­ies, our stu­dents are ex­posed to top­ics like cli­mate change, the driv­ing forces of glob­al­i­sa­tion, and racial or re­li­gious con­flicts. MIN­ISTRY OF ED­U­CA­TION</p>
