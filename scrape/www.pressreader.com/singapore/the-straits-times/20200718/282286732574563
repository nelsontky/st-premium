    <p>They (18-year-olds) are liv­ing off their par­ents and have yet to face chal­lenges in life. I have no idea if they can re­late to par­ties’ man­i­festos. Zhi Yin</p>
    <p>Please don’t. You can see how young peo­ple be­have reck­lessly when rid­ing their per­sonal mo­bil­ity de­vices on the road and pave­ment. Go­ing through na­tional ser­vice and work­ing life will shape them up to think more re­spon­si­bly. Bob Lee</p>
    <p>Frankly, as a young adult my­self, I wouldn’t rec­om­mend al­low­ing 18-year-olds to vote. Since they may not be fi­nan­cially in­de­pen­dent, may not have fam­i­lies of their own and may lack ex­pe­ri­ence in the work­force, they may not be well in­formed about how poli­cies and reg­u­la­tions work, and how poli­cies and reg­u­la­tions af­fect them and their fam­i­lies. As­ren J</p>
    <p>At 18, I wasn’t well in­formed, and lacked the ma­tu­rity to un­der­stand the whole po­lit­i­cal sit­u­a­tion. Mon­al­isa Sharma</p>
    <p>At the age of 18, vot­ers are young adults. As a demo­cratic na­tion, it is im­por­tant for younger gen­er­a­tions to en­gage in pol­i­tics. Sim Jen Lun</p>
    <p>The min­i­mum age to drive in Sin­ga­pore is 18, which some peo­ple use as an ex­am­ple to sup­port low­er­ing the vot­ing age. But have you won­dered why driv­ing in­surance charges are much higher for young and in­ex­pe­ri­enced driv­ers? Robin Yeo Meng Cer</p>
    <p>Al­most all coun­tries in the world have a vot­ing age of 18. Ariespief Ariespief</p>
    <p>Young peo­ple are eas­ily swayed, and some may not have done their own re­search, and form their opin­ions based on opin­ions that are wide­spread on­line, which may not be based on facts. Cather­ine Leck</p>
    <p>I think it’s great to get younger folk in­volved in vot­ing and po­lit­i­cal con­ver­sa­tions. They are smart, can form well-thought-out opin­ions and learn fast. But they may not have the life ex­pe­ri­ence in the work­place or have enough knowl­edge about health, hous­ing and global is­sues to un­der­stand the full con­text of gov­ern­ment poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Then again, how many of us older folk re­ally read into the poli­cies? Some peo­ple I know voted based on memes or how they don’t like their MP’s face. Po­lit­i­cal lit­er­acy and ma­tu­rity aren’t com­pletely tied to age. Bill Zheng</p>
    <p>I don’t think 18 is a good age to be able to vote. The mind­sets of these teenagers, most of whom are still in school, can be eas­ily ma­nip­u­lated. And the is­sues raised dur­ing an elec­tion con­cern bread-and-butter is­sues, which are more rel­e­vant to adults. Zeus He</p>
