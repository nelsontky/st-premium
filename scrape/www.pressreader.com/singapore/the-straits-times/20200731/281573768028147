    <p>In­vestors sold off shares of DBS Group Hold­ings, OCBC Bank and United Over­seas Bank after Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral bank asked len­ders to cap div­i­dends this year to en­sure they can sup­port busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als in the face of sig­nif­i­cant un­cer­tain­ties ahead. The three banks ac­count for nearly 40 per cent of the Straits Times In­dex.</p>
    <p>In­vestors sold off shares of DBS Group Hold­ings, Oversea-Chi­nese Bank­ing Corp (OCBC) and United Over­seas Bank (UOB) after Sin­ga­pore’s cen­tral bank asked the len­ders to cap div­i­dends this year to en­sure they can sup­port busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als in the face of sig­nif­i­cant un­cer­tain­ties ahead.</p>
    <p>In what an­a­lysts called the reg­u­la­tor’s first such pre-emp­tive move spurred by eco­nomic un­cer­tainty amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) on Wednes­day urged banks to cap their to­tal div­i­dends per share this year to 60 per cent of last year’s amount. It also said they can of­fer share­hold­ers the op­tion of re­ceiv­ing the div­i­dends in the form of ad­di­tional shares in­stead of cash.</p>
    <p>While this is a short-term neg­a­tive on the share prices of lo­cal banks, an­a­lysts said the MAS move is pru­dent and will place the banks in a stronger po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>DBS and UOB each shed more than 4 per cent be­fore end­ing the day down 3.1 per cent at $19.77 and $19.39 re­spec­tively. OCBC tum­bled more than 5 per cent be­fore clos­ing 3.8 per cent lower at $8.56 a share.</p>
    <p>The three banks ac­count for nearly 40 per cent of the Straits Times In­dex, which dropped as much as 2.4 per cent be­fore end­ing down 1.7 per cent.</p>
    <p>MAS man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Ravi Menon said on Wednes­day that the cen­tral bank re­quested the cap on pay­outs be­cause it wanted to “en­sure the banks’ cap­i­tal buf­fers re­main am­ple... so they can sus­tain lend­ing to the econ­omy”.</p>
    <p>The cen­tral bank also urged the lo­cal len­ders to show re­straint in their ex­penses and man­age­ment com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This fol­lows sim­i­lar moves taken by reg­u­la­tors in Europe, UK, the US and Aus­tralia to re­strict div­i­dend pay­outs or share buy­backs this year to con­serve cap­i­tal amid po­ten­tial as­set qual­ity de­te­ri­o­ra­tion due to the pan­demic, CGS-CIMB an­a­lyst An­drea Choong noted.</p>
    <p>The MAS move had been ex­pected, as Mr Menon had told a me­dia brief­ing ear­lier this month that the reg­u­la­tor was in talks with the banks on their cap­i­tal man­age­ment. DBS and UOB will report their re­sults on Aug 6, and OCBC on Aug 7, and should pro­vide more clar­ity on their div­i­dends and as­set qual­ity out­look.</p>
    <p>For banks that have paid in­terim div­i­dends in the first quar­ter this year, the div­i­dend cap and of­fer­ing of scrip will be ex­tended un­til the first quar­ter of 2021, OCBC In­vest­ment Re­search said.</p>
    <p>It noted DBS has said that sub­ject to board ap­proval, its cu­mu­la­tive div­i­dends will be cut to 72 cents per share for the next four quar­ters start­ing from Q2 this year (that is, 18 cents per quar­ter).</p>
    <p>Mean­while, OCBC has said that Sin­ga­pore banks are “still rel­a­tively less con­strained than Euro­pean banks, which have been re­stricted on all div­i­dends and share buy­backs this year”.</p>
    <p>There are glim­mers of hope. Sin­ga­pore banks may is­sue spe­cial div­i­dends, if the pan­demic sta­bilises and the eco­nomic out­look im­proves in fi­nan­cial year 2021, DBS group re­search eq­uity an­a­lyst Lim Rui Wen said.</p>
    <p>But she cau­tioned that risks re­main, say­ing weak­ness in the sec­ond half may spill into 2021 as re­lief mea­sures like the Jobs Sup­port Scheme ta­per off, and if there is still no vac­cine for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>She said: “Var­i­ous mort­gage and debt mora­to­ri­ums for SMEs (small and medium-sized en­ter­prises) amount­ing to $26.4 bil­lion will also ex­pire to­wards year-end... From a pol­icy stand­point, we be­lieve mora­to­rium ex­ten­sions into 1Q21 may be given.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim added: “Should (bank) as­set qual­ity be sig­nif­i­cantly worse than ex­pected, we be­lieve the div­i­dend cap may be ex­tended.”</p>
