    <p>PARIS • Since they both lost in the open­ing round in Rome, at their only clay-court tour­na­ment be­fore the French Open, Sofia Kenin and Iga Swiatek have taken rad­i­cally dif­fer­ent paths to their un­ex­pected places in to­day’s fi­nal.</p>
    <p>Kenin, the 21-year-old Amer­i­can who won the Aus­tralian Open in Fe­bru­ary, has had to scrap and im­pro­vise to avert de­feat, fight­ing through four three-set matches.</p>
    <p>But she has worked her way into a much more au­thor­i­ta­tive place, as she demon­strated on Thurs­day. She blunted Pe­tra Kvi­tova’s power and read the an­gles of her game, tak­ing a quick step in just the right di­rec­tion and re­peat­edly win­ning the ex­changes that mat­tered most in a 6-4, 7-5 semi-fi­nal vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“She just has some­thing you can’t teach: The big­ger the point, the more she wants it,” said for­mer world No. 1 Lind­say Daven­port, now a Tennis Chan­nel an­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>Swiatek, an un­seeded 19-yearold from Poland, has not had to dig nearly so deep. In­stead, she has been a force of na­ture, con­struct­ing points and de­mol­ish­ing op­po­nents with­out los­ing a set.</p>
    <p>Out of nowhere in this Grand Slam, no one has come close to find­ing a so­lu­tion to her com­pact blend of of­fence and de­fence.</p>
    <p>Not the No. 1 seed and for­mer cham­pion Si­mona Halep, whom Swiatek crushed, 6-1, 6-2, in the fourth round. Not the qual­i­fier Na­dia Podor­oska, whom Swiatek routed 6-2, 6-1 in a semi-fi­nal that lasted lit­tle more than an hour.</p>
    <p>Swiatek has yet to win a Tour ti­tle, yet she came close to play­ing in two Grand Slam fi­nals this week­end. She and part­ner Ni­cole Melichar fell to De­sirae Krawczyk and Alexa Guarachi 6-7 (5-7), 6-1, 4-6 in yes­ter­day’s women’s dou­bles semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>“It seems un­real,” said Swiatek, who is ranked 54th in sin­gles and de­cided to put off go­ing to univer­sity for two years in or­der to try to make it in tennis.</p>
    <p>“On one hand, I know that I can play great tennis. On the other hand, it’s kind of sur­pris­ing for me. I never would have thought that I’m go­ing to be in the fi­nal.”</p>
    <p>If she pre­vails she will be­come the youngest player to lift the Suzanne Lenglen Cup since Mon­ica Se­les (18) in 1992.</p>
    <p>The women’s tour­na­ment has been a dizzy­ing suc­ces­sion of up­sets and in­tro­duc­tions, with play­ers like Ar­gentina’s Podor­oska, 23, mak­ing their French Open de­buts with rank­ings out­side the top 100 and out­play­ing the vet­er­ans.</p>
    <p>The match be­tween the fourth­seeded Kenin and sev­enth-seeded Kvi­tova was only the fourth be­tween seeded play­ers i n the women’s sin­gles. The men will have a to­tal of 11 such matches.</p>
    <p>But it is hard to call the fi­nal a fluke. Swiatek’s game has been ir­re­sistible, and Kenin has shown she be­longs at this lofty level, win­ning her first Ma­jor ti­tle at the Aus­tralian Open by beat­ing lo­cal hero Ashleigh Barty and two-time Ma­jor cham­pion Gar­bine Mugu­ruza.</p>
    <p>Kenin reached the fourth round of the US Open last month, is 16-1 in Grand Slam sin­gles play this year and is in her sec­ond Ma­jor fi­nal of the sea­son. She has turned things around af­ter los­ing, 6-0, 6-0, to Vic­to­ria Azarenka last month in Rome.</p>
    <p>“I’m just re­ally grate­ful with the way that I’m play­ing, with the way things are go­ing,” said Kenin, who had never been past the quar­ter-fi­nals in a clay-court event un­til this tour­na­ment. “It’s not easy get­ting to a Grand Slam fi­nal. Hav­ing two this year, it’s re­ally spe­cial.”</p>
    <p>It seems un­real. On one hand, I know that I can play great tennis. On the other hand, it’s kind of sur­pris­ing for me. ’’</p>
