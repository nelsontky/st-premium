    <h3>THE BIG STORY</h3>
    <p>
        THE BIG STORY A7 THE STRAITS TIMES WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2020 | | | Mr Trump and Mr Biden have a 50-50 chance of
most of these states, even though the President won them by comfortabl­e margins in 2016. • No Republican president has won the White House without Florida in 100 years, and losing Florida will be very hard for Mr Trump to come back from.
• Florida tends to tally its votes quickly and a Biden win could signal it being over early for Mr Trump, while a Trump win keeps him very much in the game.
Democrats also believe that parts of the “red wall” in the Sun Belt, Georgia and Texas, are in play for them in this election. Texas, with its 38 votes, would be a big prize. If Mr Biden flips states like Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and Texas, he may be headed for a decisive victory. PRINTED AND DISTRIBUTE­D BY PRESSREADE­R PressReade­r.com +1 604 278 4604 ORIGINAL COPY .
