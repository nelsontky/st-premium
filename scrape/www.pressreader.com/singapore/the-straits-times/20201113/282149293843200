    <p>HONG KONG • South-east Asian stocks, hit par­tic­u­larly hard by the shut­down of tourism and other ser­vice in­dus­tries, are mak­ing a come­back as op­ti­mism grows over a re­turn to travel.</p>
    <p>The MSCI Asean I ndex has surged 14 per cent in an eight-day win­ning streak, al­most dou­ble the 7.4 per cent rally in the MSCI Asi­aPa­cific In­dex over the same pe­riod. At its high­est since March, the gauge of South-east Asian shares has nar­rowed the gap with its peers but still re­mains down about 14 per cent for the year. The broader Asian gauge is up 8 per cent.</p>
    <p>In­vestors are jump­ing on South­east Asian stocks as part of a global ro­ta­tion into value and out of growth sec­tors af­ter pos­i­tive re­sults from a Pfizer vac­cine boosted sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments across the re­gion are look­ing to ease so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures, with Sin­ga­pore and Hong Kong an­nounc­ing on Wed­nes­day that they will start an air travel bub­ble, re­plac­ing quar­an­tine with Covid-19 test­ing from Nov 22.</p>
    <p>“The vac­cine news opens up sec­tors un­der great stress like air­lines and ho­tels,” Mr Leon Gold­feld, head of multi-as­set so­lu­tions for the Asia-Pa­cific at JP­Mor­gan As­set Man­age­ment, said in a press brief­ing. “What we’ve seen is a mas­sive ro­ta­tion in the mar­ket from growth to value.”</p>
    <p>The value ro­ta­tion will likely last three to six months and has “some room to run”, he added.</p>
    <p>The “stars are align­ing” for a resur­gence in South-east Asian stocks, amid signs that earn­ings have bot­tomed out, ac­cord­ing to Mr Deven­dra Joshi, a strate­gist at HSBC Hold­ings. The bank is over­weight on shares from In­done­sia, Sin­ga­pore and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>“Ac­tiv­ity in Asean has picked up con­sid­er­ably since the trough, as in­di­cated by man­u­fac­tur­ing PMIs (pur­chas­ing man­agers’ in­dexes) and mo­bil­ity,” Mr Joshi wrote in a note on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>With about a third of firms hav­ing re­ported earn­ings so far, 60 per cent have met or ex­ceeded ex­pec­ta­tions, a higher pro­por­tion than the first two quar­ters of the year, he said.</p>
    <p>The Thai mar­ket, hit es­pe­cially hard due to the down­turn in tourism and wide­spread protests over the monar­chy, is start­ing to draw in­ter­est from over­seas in­vestors again.</p>
    <p>For­eign buy­ers piled a net of more than US$600 mil­lion (S$809 mil­lion) into Thai stocks on Tues­day, the big­gest pur­chase in 10 years, as the bench­mark SET In­dex jumped the most since April.</p>
    <p>Credit Suisse Group an­a­lysts have raised their rat­ing for Thai stocks to over­weight, thanks to progress on the coro­n­avirus vac­cine.</p>
    <p>For UBS Group strate­gist Niall Ma­cLeod, South-east Asian stocks are fi­nally re­act­ing to the po­ten­tial for a vac­cine, af­ter miss­ing out on past ral­lies on the theme. That in­creases the pos­si­bil­ity that, at the very least, they can out­per­form larger peers like China.</p>
    <p>“It might still be too early to call for a ro­ta­tion where South-east Asia leads the over­all mar­ket,” he wrote in a note with col­leagues on Wed­nes­day. “Nev­er­the­less, the rel­a­tive val­u­a­tion and out­per­for­mance year-to-date sug­gest China and Tai­wan could un­der­per­form the re­gion on bet­ter vac­cine news and broader open­ing up of the global econ­omy.”</p>
