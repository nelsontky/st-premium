    <p>Sup­port­ing the em­ploy­ment of peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties (PWDs) should be made part of the na­tional pol­icy on jobs, said Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>She was vis­it­ing so­cial ser­vice agency Cere­bral Palsy Al­liance Sin­ga­pore (CPAS) when she called upon co-work­ers and cus­tomers to pro­vide a sup­port­ive en­vi­ron­ment for PWDs in the work­place.</p>
    <p>Not­ing that Covid-19 has made the un­der-rep­re­sen­ta­tion of PWDs in the work­force even more ob­vi­ous, Madam Hal­imah said: “A na­tional pol­icy on jobs which in­clude PWD will en­sure greater fo­cus and plan­ning, in­clud­ing the kind of in­fras­truc­ture that is needed to pro­mote their em­ploy­ment in­stead of sub­se­quent adap­ta­tion which is more dif­fi­cult to do.</p>
    <p>“Also, with tech­nol­ogy as the en­abler, more work can be done from home or at cen­tres such as CPAS, so there should be more job op­por­tu­ni­ties ac­ces­si­ble to them.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to fig­ures re­leased by the Min­istry of Man­power last year, the res­i­dent em­ploy­ment rate for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties was 28.6 per cent, while an­other 4.2 per cent were ac­tive job seek­ers.</p>
    <p>To build a more in­clu­sive work­force, over 140 or­gan­i­sa­tions have signed the Pres­i­dent’s Chal­lenge En­abling Em­ploy­ment Pledge since it was launched in March. Madam Hal­imah urged more com­pa­nies to come on board the ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>Mr Bobby Lee Seng Tong, a trainee at CPAS, shared his ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing dis­crim­i­nated against at the work­place. The 54-year-old, who has had cere­bral palsy since birth, has been re­trenched twice in the past, with em­ploy­ers not be­ing clear to him re­gard­ing his ter­mi­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Lee was pre­vi­ously as­signed to op­er­ate CPAS push carts at Changi Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal. As push­cart oper­a­tions are sus­pended due to Covid-19, he is work­ing at CPAS’</p>
    <p>Good­will, Re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and Oc­cu­pa­tional Work­shop (Grow) un­der shel­tered em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>Find­ing sta­ble em­ploy­ment and com­mut­ing daily are chal­lenges fac­ing Mr Lee, who uses crutches and needs space to ma­noeu­vre him­self. With in­creased so­cial aware­ness of spe­cial needs, em­ploy­ers would bet­ter un­der­stand the chal­lenges fac­ing PWDs and ad­just their ex­pec­ta­tions ac­cord­ingly, he said.</p>
    <p>CPAS is com­mem­o­rat­ing World Cere­bral Palsy Day, which fell on</p>
    <p>Tues­day, with a fund-rais­ing cam­paign that runs un­til Oct 31.</p>
    <p>The #SpareYourC­hange­forSuzy cam­paign aims to reach out to at least 100 in­di­vid­ual or cor­po­rate fund-rais­ers to help CPAS achieve a tar­get of $100,000 in dona­tions. The cam­paign be­gan in Au­gust and has raised over $50,000 to date.</p>
