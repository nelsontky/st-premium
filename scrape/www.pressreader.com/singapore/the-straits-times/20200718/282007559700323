    <p>Gen­eral Elec­tion 2020 is over.</p>
    <p>The PAP (Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party) Gov­ern­ment has been re­turned to of­fice with 61.2 per cent of the vote and 83 of the 93 seats. The Work­ers’ Party now holds two GRCs (group rep­re­sen­ta­tion con­stituen­cies) and a sin­gle-mem­ber con­stituency, 10 seats in all, and for the first time since in­de­pen­dence, Sin­ga­pore has a Leader of the Op­po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>This is a his­toric wa­ter­shed. The elec­tion demon­strated that the elec­torate chose safety, se­cu­rity and so­lu­tions by re­turn­ing the in­cum­bent PAP, but at the same time wanted to strengthen op­po­si­tion voices and checks and bal­ances in the leg­is­la­ture.</p>
    <p>The elec­toral re­sult was a vote on the last five years, the last five months and the last nine days.</p>
    <p>The last five years: Vot­ers were look­ing at PAP pre­dom­i­nance or the “su­per ma­jor­ity” and how gover­nance and par­lia­men­tary de­bate had been con­ducted. They did not ap­prove of the way the elected pres­i­dent was in­tro­duced and other poli­cies as well, like Pofma (Pro­tec­tion from On­line False­hoods and Ma­nip­u­la­tion Act).</p>
    <p>The last five months. The vote was also on how the Covid pan­demic was han­dled, with the lack of clar­ity and mi­cro­manag­ing of rules and pro­to­cols for busi­nesses. There were also grow­ing fears and anx­i­eties about jobs. And in the last nine days of the cam­paign, it was about mes­sag­ing, com­mu­ni­cat­ing and the on­line pres­ence and savvi­ness of the par­ties.</p>
    <p>Which brings me to an im­por­tant fact and trend in our so­ci­ety. We talk a great deal about the youth vote and younger vot­ers.</p>
    <p>What has not been high­lighted in the commentari­es is that GE2020 oc­curs at a time when Sin­ga­pore is at its youth peak.</p>
    <p>The big­gest youth bulge is aged be­tween 25 and 35, and if you in­clude those in the age group 20 to 24, it is a huge group. The Work­ers’ Party un­der­stood this and chose youth­ful can­di­dates and is­sues for the Zoomer gen­er­a­tion who pre­fer per­sonal nar­ra­tives and “I feel your pain” con­nec­tiv­ity, ap­proach­a­bil­ity and au­then­tic­ity. This on­line dig­i­tal pol­i­tics is now the new re­tail pol­i­tics. Up close and per­sonal.</p>
    <p>Clearly, this age group bought the op­po­si­tion mes­sage of the need for di­verse voices in Par­lia­ment and the need for checks and bal­ances.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is: As this de­mo­graphic group grows older, will their val­ues and is­sues change? It has been con­ven­tional wis­dom that as peo­ple get older, they be­come more con­ser­va­tive, but a Pew Re­search re­port sug­gests Amer­i­can mil­len­ni­als and Gen Xers are dif­fer­ent from boomers and the silent older gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>They buck the trend of chang­ing, and on many is­sues, they have a dis­tinct and in­creas­ingly lib­eral out­look. So I ex­pect our mil­len­ni­als will con­tinue to sup­port di­verse voices and an op­po­si­tion in Par­lia­ment as a good thing even as they age. They will have spe­cific per­sonal con­cerns too in dif­fer­ent phases of their lives. The in­cum­bent party will have to un­der­stand this group bet­ter to win back their vote.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cam­paign and in the post-GE anal­y­sis, the word that comes up in most con­ver­sa­tions is “fair”. There is a strong de­sire to see the in­cum­bents play pol­i­tics more fairly when deal­ing with the op­po­si­tion. I have been think­ing about the evolv­ing po­lit­i­cal cul­ture of Sin­ga­pore for some time now. As</p>
    <p>I lis­ten to pan­el­lists and read the on­line posts, it is ev­i­dent that a new po­lit­i­cal cul­ture is emerg­ing.</p>
    <p>On the one hand is the cul­ture of gov­ern­ment which em­pha­sises strong gov­ern­ment, ef­fec­tive­ness, a le­gal­is­tic cul­ture, de­liv­ery of public goods and ser­vices, and a bet­ter life for the peo­ple. Crit­ics have char­ac­terised the PAP po­lit­i­cal style as pa­ter­nal­is­tic. On the other hand, many Sin­ga­pore­ans in­voke democ­racy and want to see Sin­ga­pore evolve into a full-fledged democ­racy.</p>
    <p>Yet, po­lit­i­cal com­men­ta­tors have asked why the PAP is ask­ing for a strong man­date, and why they are not more mag­nan­i­mous in the treat­ment of op­po­nents. They would like to see rules ap­plied to all po­lit­i­cal par­tic­i­pants fairly, that ger­ry­man­der­ing be re­strained.</p>
    <p>A KINDER, GEN­TLER POL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>It strikes me that even as we yearn for demo­cratic com­pe­ti­tion, com­pet­i­tive pol­i­tics, we are ask­ing for a kinder and gen­tler pol­i­tics. We seem to be re­pulsed by the com­pet­i­tive mean pol­i­tics of some Western democ­ra­cies.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­cated and younger Sin­ga­pore­ans do not want to see po­lit­i­cal overkill when the Gov­ern­ment deals with po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents. This may be the re­sult of the decades-long pre­dom­i­nance of the rul­ing party in Par­lia­ment and in gov­ern­ment that, as pol­i­tics ma­tures and evolves, these are the val­ues and norms that have come to be shared by the so­ci­ety and com­mu­nity. This is who we are.</p>
    <p>Con­se­quently, the po­lit­i­cal tools in the tool­box that worked in the past may not be ac­cept­able or as ef­fec­tive go­ing for­ward. Prime Min­is­ter Lee (Hsien Loong) was seen by many as gra­cious and hon­est in his re­ac­tion to the elec­tion re­sults, and his reach­ing out to the Work­ers’ Party leader Pri­tam Singh was ap­plauded.</p>
    <p>Post-elec­tion, the PAP as a party would seek to un­der­stand the mes­sages vot­ers were send­ing in the re­sults and as (Law and Home Af­fairs) Min­is­ter Shan­mugam said: “It re­quires a lot of soul-search­ing and re­flec­tion.” I be­lieve we will see changes. The tone post-elec­tion was a uni­fy­ing one.</p>
    <p>I’ve re­ceived a num­ber of ques­tions which have been sub­mit­ted through Face­book. What is the great­est chal­lenge for Sin­ga­pore in unit­ing our peo­ple post-this elec­tion? Are we get­ting more tol­er­ant as the pol­i­tics gets more com­pli­cated? How do we avoid this kind of po­lar­i­sa­tion, and do you think that it is cer­tain that a mul­ti­party or at least a bi-party sys­tem is go­ing to evolve in Sin­ga­pore?</p>
    <p>There is a de­vel­op­ing po­lit­i­cal cul­ture in Sin­ga­pore that wants a kinder, gen­tler pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>I do not think Sin­ga­pore­ans want to imi­tate the very di­vi­sive and mean pol­i­tics of the democ­ra­cies of the West even when they want democ­racy. So that’s a good start.</p>
    <p>BK: CHC: NA­TURE OF COM­PET­I­TIVE POL­I­TICS</p>
    <p>But in com­pet­i­tive pol­i­tics, as you get more com­pet­i­tive, willy-nilly, you will be­come more po­larised. That’s a re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>When I hear younger peo­ple say, “Why should the PAP ask for a strong man­date?” Have you ever seen a po­lit­i­cal party go­ing for elec­tions in a democ­racy say­ing, “Give me a weak man­date”?</p>
    <p>It comes with the turf. Democ­ra­cies need some of that. Just be­cause 10 op­po­si­tion mem­bers were voted in and the op­po­si­tion party had a bet­ter vote, it doesn’t mean Sin­ga­pore is di­vided. Please do not por­tray us that way. We are just ma­tur­ing and it’s been a healthy ex­pres­sion of views, and mes­sages are be­ing sent. I do not think we are at the point of be­ing dis­united or be­ing too di­vi­sive.</p>
    <p>And how do you unify the group? Well, you can’t truly unify be­cause those who voted for the op­po­si­tion and are com­mit­ted Work­ers’ Party or PSP (Progress Sin­ga­pore Party) mem­bers or SDP (Sin­ga­pore Demo­cratic Party), what­ever, will feel that way, and the com­mit­ted PAP mem­bers will feel very strongly PAP. That’s the way pol­i­tics is; it’s in ev­ery other coun­try, but you don’t con­sider that di­vi­sive pol­i­tics. Each one now has cho­sen a side to back.</p>
    <p>Does lib­er­al­ism lead to in­tol­er­ance? You can be too po­lit­i­cally cor­rect with lib­er­al­ism, and that’s in­tol­er­ant, and I’ve seen that on some cam­puses in the West and I think that’s not healthy. That’s lib­er­al­ism gone a bit funny. But lib­er­al­ism should not lead to greater in­tol­er­ance of di­ver­gent views. But peo­ple get so ex­cited or so con­vinced that they are right in their lib­eral view that they can be il­lib­eral to­wards those who do not share their lib­eral view. So yes, that’s some­thing we have to look out for. Maybe I’m op­ti­mistic but I re­ally don’t think that’s our prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Is a mul­ti­party sys­tem good for Sin­ga­pore? We will have a mul­ti­party sys­tem. Frankly, the two-party sys­tem is an aber­ra­tion that only the United States and Bri­tain have, and oc­ca­sion­ally the Lib­eral Party pops up. Most other democ­ra­cies have many par­ties.</p>
    <p>How do we ed­u­cate our young so as to live in this more com­plex po­lit­i­cal en­vi­ron­ment so that the in­evitable po­lit­i­cal dis­agree­ments do not get out of hand?</p>
    <p>How do you avoid group po­lar­i­sa­tion? We can only keep pro­duc­ing more op­por­tu­ni­ties for a class of multi-eth­nic­i­ties, multi-races to be together – it’s ex­po­sure to it and how do we keep or­gan­is­ing that. I am very glad that in re­cent years we have be­come more and more aware of multi-eth­nic­i­ties, al­though we have to im­prove still on tol­er­ance. Not ev­ery­one has the same tol­er­ance or think of dif­fer­ent eth­nic­i­ties other than their own in the same pos­i­tive way, and that we’ve got to try to change.</p>
    <p>BK: CHC: DIG­I­TAL SI­LOS</p>
    <p>The prob­lem is, in this dig­i­tal world, we are all just go­ing into the web­sites and the chat groups of maybe our own kind, our own val­ues, our own pol­i­tics. So we are quite “siloed”.</p>
    <p>And how do you break through those si­los which are build­ing up with tech­nol­ogy and the dig­i­tal world? I think it’s a very se­ri­ous ques­tion. It’s a whole bunch of ac­tions, not just one ac­tion. It has to hap­pen in school, it has to hap­pen in the so­cial space. And I’m al­ways very aware of en­sur­ing that we have di­ver­sity when we hire, when we have a party, when we have speak­ers on a plat­form, but I can’t say ev­ery­one shares the same kind of re­flex.</p>
    <p>I re­mem­ber walk­ing into an event on an Amer­i­can cam­pus or­gan­ised by Sin­ga­pore and I walked in and I looked. I said: “Why are there so few mi­nori­ties here?” The or­gan­iser did not think of it; they just al­lowed every­body to reg­is­ter and did not go out of the way to make sure that there was a broad rep­re­sen­ta­tion. So the point is, be aware of it, work for it, in­crease the so­cial spa­ces for en­gage­ment, and you hope with time we learn.</p>
    <p>I like to think of younger peo­ple as more lib­eral, more multi-eth­nic, in­ter-eth­nic, but there is also a num­ber of younger peo­ple that live in their own sep­a­rate siloed worlds.</p>
    <p>GOOD GOVER­NANCE BK:</p>
    <p>Are Sin­ga­pore­ans be­ing too crit­i­cal of good gover­nance or maybe in­suf­fi­ciently ap­pre­cia­tive of good gover­nance? To what ex­tent did the “flight to safety” mech­a­nism fail be­cause of the PAP’s real or per­ceived fail­ings in han­dling Covid? In other words, is good gover­nance un­der­rated now or not enough?</p>
    <p>A short and easy an­swer is that we have taken good gover­nance for granted, be­cause we’ve had good gover­nance all the time. The one way to know it is when you travel out of Sin­ga­pore. I am con­stantly be­ing told in the United States what a won­der­ful gov­ern­ment we have and we wish we could have your gov­ern­ment, etc. In Sin­ga­pore, Sin­ga­pore­ans are</p>
    <p>CHC:</p>
    <p>very crit­i­cal of the Gov­ern­ment, and they point to all the lit­tle pock­marks on the face. I think we just got used to good gover­nance and we take good gover­nance for granted. And I think we should try to ap­pre­ci­ate that. Of course, the best les­son is when you start hav­ing bad gover­nance, but I hope we never get to that point.</p>
    <p>The val­ues that are be­ing em­pha­sised, even by some of the op­po­si­tion par­ties, show they un­der­stand what good gover­nance en­tails. The fact that the Work­ers’ Party is very much a mod­er­ate party and like the PAP; they don’t want to dif­fer too much, which means they un­der­stand what are the val­ues at stake and what a large pro­por­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans value, and that must in­clude all the prin­ci­ples that make up good gover­nance.</p>
    <p>But, we should not see an elec­tion like this as a re­jec­tion of good gover­nance ei­ther. It’s an elec­tion where griev­ances were there, peo­ple were los­ing jobs and their busi­nesses were in trou­ble, so all these are spe­cific rea­sons at a par­tic­u­lar elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Also, many peo­ple be­lieve the PAP would win any­way. All of us know we re­ceived all those bookie an­nounce­ments – I saw a cou­ple which said the PAP would sweep ev­ery­thing, and there were other bookie an­nounce­ments where they said that the op­po­si­tion will sweep ev­ery­thing. So there’s a lot of dis­in­for­ma­tion be­ing cir­cu­lated pre-elec­tion.</p>
    <p>But I think Sin­ga­pore­ans knew they would have the PAP in gov­ern­ment, so you are as­sured of safety and in­cum­bency of the in­cum­bents. But they do yearn to have an op­po­si­tion voice in Par­lia­ment, and I think the re­sults show that, and younger Sin­ga­pore­ans show that they value this.</p>
    <p>Now I would say that, frankly, if the PAP were ever in a po­si­tion where the seats in Par­lia­ment be­come – like you have 83 (PAP) seats now, let’s say, if it gets to about 30 op­po­si­tion seats in Par­lia­ment, peo­ple will think very care­fully when they vote.</p>
    <p>If the op­po­si­tion par­ties come up to ex­pec­ta­tions, well, peo­ple will say, “Let’s see”. But if the per­for­mance is not good, there will be the feel­ing about what the PAP of­fered as good gover­nance, (which) would also be ap­pre­ci­ated again. But then the PAP could also get com­pla­cent and not at­tend to what they have at­tended to in the past... and they would be also in some tight spot.</p>
    <p>WILL SIN­GA­PORE BE BY­PASSED? BK:</p>
    <p>Okay, a clus­ter of ques­tions on glob­al­i­sa­tion. I’m go­ing to try to sum­marise them.</p>
    <p>With glob­al­i­sa­tion, do you think the na­tion state would en­dure? Re­lated to that is, there seems to be a lack of global lead­er­ship right now. When any ma­jor po­lit­i­cal power takes an ini­tia­tive, it is op­posed by some other ma­jor power or it ap­pears that way. And, his­tor­i­cally Sin­ga­pore’s ge­o­graphic lo­ca­tion was a cru­cial fac­tor. Is that still go­ing to be a cru­cial fac­tor, go­ing for­ward?</p>
    <p>I’ll take the last ques­tion first. Is it the lo­ca­tion that has helped us?</p>
    <p>CHC:</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is a global city. Will we be by­passed?</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who read and an­a­lyse global cities will point out that if a global city such as Sin­ga­pore de­vel­ops a num­ber of ac­tiv­i­ties, and you ag­glom­er­ate ac­tiv­i­ties, and you spe­cialise and they all be­come so in­evitable that you are the go-to place to be, you keep your po­si­tion, and peo­ple will make a stop be­cause you are the place to be.</p>
    <p>If we think of it that way, Sin­ga­pore has ag­glom­er­ated its ac­tiv­i­ties very well, no mat­ter whether it is ship­ping, com­mu­ni­ca­tions, oil, bank­ing – you have a whole slew of an­cil­lary ac­tiv­i­ties around an in­dus­try that builds up the im­por­tance of that in­dus­try. Now that will make it hard to shift things off.</p>
    <p>Will our lo­ca­tion ever be, in fact, ir­rel­e­vant? Will we be made ir­rel­e­vant?</p>
    <p>That’s a ques­tion that’s al­ways asked. And I have told many peo­ple overseas – do you know the Sin­ga­pore Cabi­net, in fact, must be the only Cabi­net in the world that read A His­tory Of Venice (by John Julius Nor­wich), this big thick book, in the 80s or 90s? Be­cause what hap­pened to Venice could hap­pen to us and you can be made ir­rel­e­vant.</p>
    <p>So we must al­ways find out what is the im­por­tant trend, what is the im­por­tant tech­no­log­i­cal de­vel­op­ment so that you are not blind­sided. I think that’s what Sin­ga­pore has to do. That’s what the PAP Gov­ern­ment has been do­ing – how not to be blind­sided, how to an­tic­i­pate what is hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>But you never know. Honolulu was by­passed when the size of aero­planes changed and you don’t have to stop in Honolulu any more. So in Sin­ga­pore, we must al­ways find out what tech­nol­ogy can ren­der us ob­so­lete, but also what will come up in­stead, the new wave of eco­nomic ac­tiv­i­ties and us­ing dif­fer­ent kinds of tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>So, maybe in the fu­ture, it is not lo­ca­tion, lo­ca­tion and lo­ca­tion, but we could have lo­ca­tion as the dig­i­tal hub, and that’s a dif­fer­ent kind of lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>HEALTHY EX­PRES­SION OF VIEWS</p>
    <p>When I hear younger peo­ple say, ‘Why should the PAP ask for a strong man­date?’ Have you ever seen a po­lit­i­cal party go­ing for elec­tions in a democ­racy say­ing, ‘Give me a weak man­date’? It comes with the turf. Democ­ra­cies need some of that. Just be­cause 10 op­po­si­tion mem­bers were voted in and the op­po­si­tion party had a bet­ter vote, it doesn’t mean Sin­ga­pore is di­vided... We are just ma­tur­ing and it’s been a healthy ex­pres­sion of views, and mes­sages are ’’ be­ing sent.</p>
    <p>PRO­FES­SOR CHAN HENG CHEE</p>
    <p>GLOBAL LEAD­ER­SHIP</p>
    <p>Lack of global lead­er­ship: Yes, there’s a lack of global lead­er­ship and it’s very dif­fi­cult to gov­ern well to­day, be­cause the world has gone so com­plex.</p>
    <p>We al­ways look back to World War II, which pro­duced all your giants or we thought they were giants. Now they want to pull down Win­ston Churchill’s statue, but Win­ston Churchill is con­sid­ered a gi­ant. Roo­sevelt. Even Stalin is a gi­ant in the Soviet Union, but, of course, there are so many neg­a­tives there. But they were giants at a par­tic­u­lar time in his­tory. To­day, the world is get­ting very com­plex, so that it is very hard to see giants stride across the stage.</p>
    <p>We re­ally have to come to grips with tech­nol­ogy and how dis­rup­tive tech­nol­ogy can be, and how tech­nol­ogy can re­shape so­ci­ety, so that it’s hard for even those in gov­ern­ment to try to con­nect with so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>And that’s why I said that the dis­rup­tion caused by tech­nol­ogy is greater than the dis­rup­tion caused by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>So yes, there’s a lack of global lead­er­ship, but (through) re­gional group­ings, in re­gions, coun­tries are try­ing to come together to make up for that deficit by of­fer­ing re­gional lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>With glob­al­i­sa­tion, will the na­tion state en­dure? We first thought (with) glob­al­i­sa­tion, will we be one global com­mu­nity? We found that was not true.</p>
    <p>With glob­al­i­sa­tion, there was greater turn­ing in­wards and an em­pha­sis on lo­cal­i­sa­tion. When you are so global, you lose your iden­tity, and you do not know where you be­long. So, peo­ple yearn for their own dis­tinc­tive iden­tity in the coun­try or in the tribe. That’s the other face of glob­al­i­sa­tion – glob­al­i­sa­tion and lo­cal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Will na­tion states en­dure and sur­vive? I’m a po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist. I be­lieve in mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism, but I also think na­tion states will sur­vive. You look at the projects of mul­ti­lat­er­al­ism. Europe – you find that the na­tion state is alive and well in Europe, but they also share cer­tain com­mon Euro­pean projects together. But the na­tion state is, in fact, very strong.</p>
