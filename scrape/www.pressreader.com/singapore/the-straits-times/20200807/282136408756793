    <p>Mil­lions of In­done­sia’s mi­cro, small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (MSMEs) are strug­gling to sur­vive amid the Covid-19 out­break, which has seen 119,000 in­fec­tions and 5,500 deaths in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>While many of the busi­nesses are turn­ing to cre­ative ways to keep afloat, such as go­ing on­line, oth­ers are jump­ing into new ven­tures as they wait for the sit­u­a­tion to im­prove.</p>
    <p>Mr Deni Gaos, a shoe­maker in Ban­dung, West Java, saw his sales drop by around 80 per cent af­ter a ma­jor client – a prom­i­nent lo­cal shoe brand – stopped buy­ing in early April.</p>
    <p>As his rev­enue plunged, he laid off his five em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>The 43-year-old fa­ther of two switched to sell­ing shoes on­line, but sales have barely reached half of pre-pandemic lev­els.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally hope the sit­u­a­tion will soon im­prove and the econ­omy can re­cover so that my or­ders can re­turn,” Mr Deni, who be­gan his busi­ness in 2011, told The Straits Times over the phone.</p>
    <p>While he has man­aged to sol­dier on, many oth­ers have not been able to do so.</p>
    <p>Around 70 per cent of In­done­sian MSMEs have stopped op­er­a­tions, ei­ther tem­po­rar­ily or per­ma­nently, ac­cord­ing to a sur­vey on 571 SMEs by the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion in April.</p>
    <p>There are about 64 mil­lion MSMEs in In­done­sia that em­ploy 116.9 mil­lion peo­ple, or 97 per cent of the labour force. These com­pa­nies con­trib­ute al­most 61 per cent to In­done­sia’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, ac­cord­ing to data from Bank Rakyat In­done­sia, the coun­try’s largest lender by as­sets.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the 1997-1998 fi­nan­cial cri­sis, many MSMEs proved re­silient. But now they have been hit hard by the out­break be­cause the coun­try’s par­tial lock­downs have hin­dered con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>Ban­dung-based sarong pro­ducer Rendi Ak­bar Sid­diq is among those shift­ing to other types of busi­nesses to make ends meet, while hop­ing for a quick eco­nomic re­bound.</p>
    <p>He lost his in­come in March as de­mand from his traders in South­east Asia’s largest tex­tile mar­ket in Tanah Abang in Jakarta weak­ened. He used to sell around 6,000 sarongs each month, earn­ing 100 mil­lion ru­piah (S$9,400).</p>
    <p>With thou­sands of sarongs piled up in his ware­house, the 28-yearold halted op­er­a­tions and fired his five em­ploy­ees in March.</p>
    <p>Mr Rendi, who be­gan his busi­ness in 2017, has had his loans at two banks re­struc­tured, with only one of the banks still re­quir­ing him to pay a small monthly in­stal­ment.</p>
    <p>To earn some money, he started sell­ing rice in late June.</p>
    <p>“I think it will take more than six months for the tex­tile in­dus­try to re­cover,” Mr Rendi said.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has rolled out a num­ber of in­cen­tives for MSMEs to­talling 123.46 tril­lion ru­piah, in­clud­ing in­ter­est sub­si­dies and tax in­cen­tives, to tide them over the hard times.</p>
    <p>Late last month, the gov­ern­ment vowed to chan­nel work­ing cap­i­tal to 12 mil­lion MSMEs, with each set to get 2.4 mil­lion ru­piah.</p>
    <p>But Dr Enny Sri Har­tati, an econ­o­mist at the In­sti­tute for De­vel­op­ment of Eco­nomics and Fi­nance , said some of the in­cen­tives are not well tar­geted.</p>
    <p>Cit­ing tax in­cen­tives as an ex­am­ple, she said that around 98 per cent of lo­cal MSMEs do not pay taxes be­cause of the small scale of their busi­nesses and tiny rev­enues.</p>
    <p>“Most as­sis­tance of­fered by the gov­ern­ment con­cerns fi­nanc­ing, while the prob­lem is not the liq­uid­ity,” she said, adding that the gov­ern­ment now needs to speed up the dis­burse­ment of funds al­lo­cated for pro­grammes aimed at in­creas­ing peo­ple’s pur­chas­ing power, which can help push up de­mand.</p>
