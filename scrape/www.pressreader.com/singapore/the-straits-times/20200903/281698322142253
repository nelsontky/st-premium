    <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yes­ter­day warned against Sin­ga­pore’s pol­i­tics go­ing down the path of po­lar­i­sa­tion, as this would di­vide the coun­try and send it into a down­ward spi­ral.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will not just cease be­ing an ex­cep­tional na­tion if pol­i­tics per­me­ates ev­ery is­sue and ev­ery sub­ject be­comes par­ti­san, he added. “It will be the end of us.”</p>
    <p>In a speech set­ting out why it is cru­cial for the coun­try to get its pol­i­tics right, PM Lee said that hav­ing an ad­e­quate num­ber of op­po­si­tion MPs in Par­lia­ment is good for Sin­ga­pore, as it keeps the Gov­ern­ment on its toes and shows Sin­ga­pore­ans that it has noth­ing to hide.</p>
    <p>But for pol­i­tics here to work, the Gov­ern­ment and the op­po­si­tion must share the over­rid­ing ob­jec­tive of work­ing for Sin­ga­pore, and not just for their party or sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing more op­po­si­tion MPs and fiercer de­bate in the House may not nec­es­sar­ily be bet­ter, the Prime Minister said, cau­tion­ing that the tone of Sin­ga­pore’s po­lit­i­cal de­bate could change for the worse.</p>
    <p>“We all hope that di­ver­sity will make a hun­dred flow­ers bloom. But how do we pre­vent di­ver­sity from pro­duc­ing po­lar­i­sa­tion?” he said.</p>
    <p>“How do we make sure that dis­agree­ment does not re­sult in paral­y­sis?” he asked, not­ing that this has hap­pened in many other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects the tone of de­bate in Par­lia­ment to shift with a stronger op­po­si­tion pres­ence, and said Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party MPs will have to raise their game, be pre­pared for sharper ques­tion­ing, and de­fend the Gov­ern­ment’s poli­cies and de­ci­sions while speak­ing up for their con­stituents.</p>
    <p>PM Lee called on op­po­si­tion MPs to also step up and go be­yond crit­i­cis­ing gov­ern­ment pro­pos­als to putting up their own pro­pos­als to be ex­am­ined and de­bated.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment, on its part, will take an open and con­struc­tive ap­proach, he said.</p>
    <p>“On the spe­cific de­tails of poli­cies... we will be open-minded, we will lis­ten to the dif­fer­ent voices. We can try dif­fer­ent schemes, so­lu­tions. We will take in all con­struc­tive views and per­spec­tives.”</p>
    <p>But on ma­jor is­sues con­cern­ing Sin­ga­pore’s fun­da­men­tal in­ter­ests, the Gov­ern­ment can­not wait pas­sively for con­sen­sus to form, he added. If there re­main dif­fer­ent views at the end of a full dis­cus­sion, it will have to make the de­ci­sion it judges best, and take re­spon­si­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing been elected to gov­ern, we must gov­ern,” he said.</p>
    <p>It is the Gov­ern­ment’s duty to make such de­ci­sions, and be ac­count­able to Sin­ga­pore­ans for them, he added.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if the is­sue is not poli­cies and pri­or­i­ties but a chal­lenge to his team’s fit­ness to gov­ern, then the Gov­ern­ment will have to stand up and de­fend it­self vig­or­ously, PM Lee said. “It must put down the chal­lenge and prove that it de­serves to be the gov­ern­ment,” he said. “Be­cause oth­er­wise, it must step aside and let an­other team take over.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s West­min­ster-style democ­racy, based on the Bri­tish model, is in­her­ently ad­ver­sar­ial, PM Lee noted.</p>
    <p>In Par­lia­ment, the leader of the op­po­si­tion sits op­po­site the prime minister, chal­leng­ing the in­cum­bent and point­ing out his faults, he said. The leader of the op­po­si­tion highlights the Gov­ern­ment’s short­com­ings and chips away at his op­po­nents’ cred­i­bil­ity, with the ul­ti­mate goal of tak­ing their place in gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>PM Lee noted that Mr Keir Starmer, the Labour Party’s new leader, is do­ing his best to “show up cur­rent Bri­tish PM Boris John­son, and to make a name for him­self”. In Aus­tralia, ques­tion time for Prime Minister Scott Mor­ri­son hap­pens ev­ery day when Par­lia­ment sits, of­ten last­ing more than an hour.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery en­counter is a glad­i­a­to­rial con­test,” he said.</p>
    <p>In both these ju­ris­dic­tions, the prime minister has to “stand his ground, de­fend his gov­ern­ment’s poli­cies and main­tain psy­cho­log­i­cal dom­i­nance, to show that he de­serves to be PM”.</p>
    <p>“If not, MPs on both sides will sense it, and so will the pub­lic, and this will in­flu­ence elec­tion out­comes as well as lead­er­ship con­tests in their par­ties,” PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the tone of par­lia­men­tary de­bate is less com­bat­ive and its po­lit­i­cal tra­di­tions have de­vel­oped dif­fer­ently, he noted.</p>
    <p>PM Lee said he lis­tened closely to Leader of the Op­po­si­tion Pri­tam</p>
    <p>Singh’s speech on Mon­day, on how he in­tends to per­form his new role.</p>
    <p>“I ap­plaud his tone and ap­proach,” he said of the Work­ers’ Party chief. “The gov­ern­ment benches will do our part to work with him, to keep Par­lia­ment a con­struc­tive fo­rum for de­bate.”</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, the type of pol­i­tics that Sin­ga­pore has de­pends on Sin­ga­pore­ans, who have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to en­gage in pub­lic dis­course, send the right sig­nals at the bal­lot box and re­ward par­ties that do the right thing and de­liver, he said.</p>
    <p>“The standards they de­mand of po­lit­i­cal lead­ers, PAP and op­po­si­tion, will in­flu­ence the qual­ity of the po­lit­i­cal lead­er­ship, the level of dis­cus­sion and de­bate in Par­lia­ment; they will de­ter­mine whether our pol­i­tics en­ables us to thrive and pros­per, or di­vides and de­stroys us,” he added.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the PAP Gov­ern­ment has been able to do the right things for Sin­ga­pore­ans and still get re-elected, PM Lee noted. “Some­times we’ve paid the price in the vote, but over­all, we’ve con­tin­ued to win elec­tions. And there­fore the Gov­ern­ment has been able to think long term, well be­yond the next gen­eral elec­tion.”</p>
    <p>The coun­try pro­gresses, Sin­ga­pore­ans ben­e­fit and the PAP con­tin­ues to win elec­tions in a “vir­tu­ous, self-re­in­forc­ing cir­cle”.</p>
    <p>“This model has worked well for Sin­ga­pore,” PM Lee said. “Once bro­ken, it will be very dif­fi­cult to put back together again.”</p>
    <p>He asked if Sin­ga­pore could con­tinue to work this way, and keep its fo­cus on the long term with more di­ver­sity and con­tes­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>“At what point does a vote for a strong op­po­si­tion be­come a vote for a dif­fer­ent gov­ern­ment?</p>
    <p>“Is it re­ally true that one day if there is a change of gov­ern­ment, a new party can run Sin­ga­pore equally well be­cause we have such a good pub­lic ser­vice, as Mr Pri­tam Singh sug­gested on Mon­day?</p>
    <p>“It’s like say­ing you have the New York Phil­har­monic Or­ches­tra, any­body can be the con­duc­tor.”</p>
    <p>These ques­tions have no easy an­swers, and in the na­ture of pol­i­tics and hu­man so­ci­eties, things can and do go wrong, PM Lee said.</p>
    <p>“Each suc­ces­sive gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans has to keep on do­ing its best to keep the sys­tem work­ing right,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The PAP feels acutely its spe­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity to keep on do­ing its best for Sin­ga­pore, and keep Sin­ga­pore work­ing in this unique way. That is our sa­cred mis­sion.</p>
    <p>“We will do our ut­most to per­suade good men and women to en­ter pol­i­tics, to take over the torch and lead the next gen­er­a­tion for­ward. We will fight hard to win the hearts and minds of Sin­ga­pore­ans, and show Sin­ga­pore­ans that the PAP con­tin­ues to de­serve their sup­port and trust.”</p>
