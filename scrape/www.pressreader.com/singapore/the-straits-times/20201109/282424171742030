    <p>LONDON • Bit­coin’s rally above US$15,000 has reignited de­bate over whether the cryp­tocur­rency is so-called dig­i­tal gold or a per­ilously risky bet as in­vestors grap­ple with the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The world’s most pop­u­lar vir­tual unit has gained over 30 per cent in value in al­most three weeks up to last Fri­day, tak­ing it close to its De­cem­ber 2017 peak when it reached nearly US$20,000.</p>
    <p>After a roller­coaster ride on mar­kets since then, it be­gan its lat­est me­te­oric rise on Oct 21, fol­low­ing an an­nounce­ment by US on­line pay­ments provider PayPal that it would en­able ac­count hold­ers to use cryp­tocur­rency.</p>
    <p>“It is the val­i­da­tion of a mar­ket which was still rel­a­tively un­cer­tain a few years ago,” said Mr Si­mon Pol­rot, pres­i­dent of the Paris-based crypto-as­sets as­so­ci­a­tion Adan.</p>
    <p>Bit­coin was cre­ated in 2008 by the pseudony­mous Satoshi Nakamoto, and mar­keted as an al­ter­na­tive to tra­di­tional cur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>Un­reg­u­lated by cen­tral banks, it was sold as an at­trac­tive op­tion for in­vestors with an ap­petite for the ex­otic – and crim­i­nals have also seen its un­der-the-radar ap­peal.</p>
    <p>How­ever, after bit­coin sur­passed US$1,000 for the first time in 2013, it has in­creas­ingly at­tracted the at­ten­tion of fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>The more re­cent ar­rival of big play­ers in the vir­tual mar­ket, such as PayPal and Mastercard, are “very im­por­tant sig­nals” so­lid­i­fy­ing that trend, said Mr Pol­rot.</p>
    <p>PayPal said it would al­low users to buy and sell us­ing bit­coin as well as other cryp­tocur­ren­cies such as Ethereum and Lite­coin.</p>
    <p>“The mi­gra­tion to­wards dig­i­tal pay­ments and dig­i­tal rep­re­sen­ta­tions of value con­tin­ues to ac­cel­er­ate, driven by the Covid-19 pan­demic and the in­creased in­ter­est in dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies from cen­tral banks and con­sumers,” the com­pany said.</p>
    <p>The US Fed­eral Re­serve and Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank are hold­ing con­sul­ta­tions on the pos­si­ble launch of their own vir­tual cur­ren­cies, while China’s cen­tral bank started ex­per­i­ment­ing with dig­i­tal pay­ments in four ci­ties in April.</p>
    <p>Also, in­vest­ment bank­ing gi­ant JPMor­gan Chase has joined in­dus­try play­ers in the in­creas­ing op­ti­mism around bit­coin.</p>
    <p>After PayPal’s an­nounce­ment, an­a­lysts at the bank com­pared the cryp­tocur­rency to gold.</p>
    <p>“Bit­coin could com­pete more in­tensely with gold as an ‘al­ter­na­tive’ cur­rency over the com­ing years, given that mil­len­ni­als will be­come over time a more im­por­tant com­po­nent of in­vestors’ uni­verse,” they said.</p>
    <p>They also noted that the to­tal cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of the cryp­tocur­rency mar­ket is 10 times lower than gold, with some spec­u­lat­ing that it could steadily close that gulf.</p>
    <p>That view­point rep­re­sents a sig­nif­i­cant shift, given that JPMor­gan chief Jamie Di­mon had de­scribed bit­coin as a “fraud” two years ago.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, its price leapt nearly 9 per cent and gold ral­lied 2.45 per cent, as the election in the United States im­pacted the mar­ket. The rises sparked fresh com­par­isons of the two as­sets.</p>
    <p>“Crypto could con­sti­tute a form of safe haven in a con­text where con­fi­dence in fiat money is a lit­tle un­der­mined,” said Mr Pol­rot.</p>
    <p>As with gold, bit­coin could ben­e­fit as cen­tral banks world­wide gush out tril­lions in stim­u­lus sup­port to counter the dev­as­tat­ing ef­fects of the Covid-19 pan­demic, po­ten­tially di­lut­ing the value of their cur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>Both gold and bit­coin are “mined” – vir­tu­ally, by com­puter users, in the cryp­tocur­rency’s case – and have a fi­nite sup­ply, in con­trast to hard cash printed in un­lim­ited amounts by cen­tral banks.</p>
    <p>How­ever, oth­ers have pointed to the highly volatile and spec­u­la­tive na­ture of cryp­tocur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>“There is no room for bit­coin in a se­ri­ous forex port­fo­lio,” said a London trader who asked to re­main anony­mous, not­ing that the unit had lost a quar­ter of its value in March alone be­fore re­sum­ing its rally more re­cently.</p>
    <p>“That would be a catas­tro­phe for a forex trader – we use gold to bal­ance our port­fo­lio.”</p>
