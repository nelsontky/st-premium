    <p>Ms Greer McVay in­sists she is</p>
    <p>“not an anti-vaxxer – not at all”.</p>
    <p>She is up to date with her own im­mu­ni­sa­tions and had her son vac­ci­nated when he was a child. But she fears the devel­op­ment of a vac­cine for coro­n­avirus is be­ing dan­ger­ously rushed, in part to im­prove United States Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s prospects ahead of the pres­i­den­tial election in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>“This sit­u­a­tion is dif­fer­ent be­cause of the pol­i­tics that have been in­jected into the process and the speed at which they’re de­vel­op­ing the vac­cines,” says Ms McVay, a com­mu­ni­ca­tions con­sul­tant from Cal­i­for­nia and a sup­porter of the Demo­cratic Party. “Frankly, I don’t trust this pres­i­dent. It just gives me pause.”</p>
    <p>Ms McVay, 53, is one of a grow­ing num­ber of “vac­cine hes­i­tant” Amer­i­cans who have not pre­vi­ously iden­ti­fied with the anti-vaxxer move­ment, which has tra­di­tion­ally been dom­i­nated by lib­er­tar­ian Repub­li­cans and those on the left who preach the ben­e­fits of al­ter­na­tive medicine over phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals. “I don’t fall into ei­ther cat­e­gory,” she says.</p>
    <p>Rather, she fears Mr Trump will put pres­sure on the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) to quickly ap­prove a vac­cine be­fore the election. She cites as ev­i­dence the FDA’s de­ci­sion to al­low the use of hy­drox­y­chloro­quine – a dis­proved drug touted by Mr Trump – to treat the virus be­fore it per­formed a U-turn af­ter sev­eral stud­ies showed the medicine did not ben­e­fit pa­tients.</p>
    <p>She is also mis­trust­ful of Op­er­a­tion Warp Speed, a fed­er­ally funded ef­fort that has paid bil­lions of dol­lars to drug com­pa­nies – in­clud­ing US$1.2 bil­lion (S$1.64 bil­lion) to As­traZeneca and US$1.6 bil­lion to No­vavax – to man­u­fac­ture hun­dreds of mil­lions of doses of their vac­cine “at risk” or with­out full clin­i­cal tri­als in ad­vance of de­fin­i­tive data.</p>
    <p>“The way they are ex­pe­dit­ing the process is by do­ing things con­cur­rently,” she says. “They’re be­gin­ning man­u­fac­tur­ing be­fore they’ve even com­pleted the trial.”</p>
    <p>The dis­cov­ery of a vac­cine be­fore the election might well boost Mr Trump’s chances by al­low­ing him to claim he has turned the tide against a dis­ease that has killed more than 177,000 Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>But pub­lic health ex­perts fear it could also lead to a hard­en­ing of anti-vac­ci­na­tion sen­ti­ment among peo­ple like Ms McVay ahead of what will be one of the largest mass im­mu­ni­sa­tion pro­grammes in re­cent US history.</p>
    <p>Two vac­cines have al­ready been ap­proved – one in Russia and a sec­ond in China – while eight are in the fi­nal stage of clin­i­cal test­ing.</p>
    <p>“Anti-vac­ci­na­tion sen­ti­ment is go­ing into the main­stream,” says Pro­fes­sor Heidi Lar­son, direc­tor of the Vac­cine Con­fi­dence Project at the Lon­don School of Hy­giene and Trop­i­cal Medicine. “A lot of peo­ple you never would have imag­ined are now say­ing that maybe the anti-vac­ci­na­tion lobby has a point.”</p>
    <p>Dr Har­vey Fineberg, the chair of a com­mit­tee on coro­n­avirus set up by the Na­tional Acad­e­mies of Sci­ences, En­gi­neer­ing and Medicine, says: “I am con­cerned about peo­ple re­sist­ing im­mu­ni­sa­tion for ir­ra­tional rea­sons based on generic dis­trust of any­thing the pres­i­dent says.”</p>
    <p>TWO CAMPS OF VAC­CINE SCEPTICS</p>
    <p>Polls show that as the pan­demic has con­tin­ued, Amer­i­can cit­i­zens have be­come less con­fi­dent about the safety of a vac­cine. Polling by YouGov in May found that around 55 per cent of US adults said they would get a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>By the end of last month, that fig­ure had dropped to 41 per cent – well be­low the 60 to 70 per cent pub­lic health ex­perts think will be needed to achieve “herd im­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>Mr Joe Bi­den, Mr Trump’s Demo­cratic op­po­nent, has seized on the sur­veys as proof that the pres­i­dent is fu­elling vac­cine scep­ti­cism. “It’s not the usual anti-vac­cine crowd – it’s be­yond that – be­cause peo­ple are los­ing faith in what the pres­i­dent says,” Mr Bi­den said last month.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there is also sub­stan­tial op­po­si­tion to vac­cines in other high-in­come coun­tries which are likely to be more scep­ti­cal about the safety of im­mu­ni­sa­tions, ac­cord­ing to a re­cent study by the Well­come Trust, a Bri­tish re­search char­ity. In France, less than half of peo­ple be­lieve vac­cines are safe, the re­port found. In Ukraine, the fig­ure is just 29 per cent.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who worry about vac­cines fall broadly into two camps: those who are out­right op­posed to them and a far big­ger num­ber who are un­sure that they are safe. Aca­demics term the lat­ter group “vac­cine hes­i­tant”.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns about vac­ci­na­tions vary from coun­try to coun­try, but they are of­ten held by peo­ple not nor­mally associated with fringe views or con­spir­acy the­o­ries. Many are highly ed­u­cated and they are just as likely to be lib­eral as con­ser­va­tive.</p>
    <p>“If you want to map where the anti-vac­ci­na­tion move­ment is strong­est, just look for your near­est Whole Foods,” says Dr Barry Bloom, a pro­fes­sor of pub­lic health at Har­vard Uni­ver­sity, re­fer­ring to the high-end su­per­mar­ket chain.</p>
    <p>Those who study the phenomenon say they have be­gun to find anti-vac­ci­na­tion ma­te­rial be­ing shared among a far wider group of peo­ple since the out­break of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“My re­searchers have found Face­book groups which have noth­ing to do with vac­ci­na­tions sud­denly widely shar­ing mis­in­for­ma­tion about them,” says Prof Lar­son. “There is a lot of anger and emo­tion in the world right now, and the de­bate around vac­cines has been an op­por­tu­nity for that to bub­ble up.”</p>
    <p>One ex­am­ple of this is how sup­port­ers of QAnon, a pro-Trump net­work of con­spir­acy the­o­rists, are in­creas­ingly shar­ing anti-vac­ci­na­tion ma­te­rial. High-pro­file mem­bers have been pro­mot­ing the false the­ory that the coro­n­avirus was de­lib­er­ately de­vel­oped and spread by Mi­crosoft co-founder Bill Gates, who is a pro-vac­ci­na­tion health cam­paigner.</p>
    <p>BREAKNECK SPEED OF RE­SEARCH</p>
    <p>Much of the doubt stems from the breakneck speed at which coro­n­avirus vac­cines are be­ing de­vel­oped. The pre­vi­ous record for de­vel­op­ing a vac­cine is four years for mumps and that was more than five decades ago. If one is proven to be suc­cess­ful in Oc­to­ber, it will have taken just nine months.</p>
    <p>Even some phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ex­ec­u­tives, such as Merck chief ex­ec­u­tive Ken Fra­zier, have warned of the dan­gers of mov­ing too quickly.</p>
    <p>Anti-vaxxers have also seized on the fact that some de­vel­op­ers are us­ing a rel­a­tively new tech­nol­ogy called mes­sen­ger RNA that at­tempts to al­ter the body’s pro­tein-mak­ing ma­chin­ery.</p>
    <p>In late June, Dr Car­rie Madej, a long-term anti-vaxxer physi­cian from Ge­or­gia, re­leased a video on YouTube that has been viewed more than 409,000 times, in which she mixed truths about mRNA vac­cines, such as the fact that they are be­ing stud­ied in hu­mans with­out hav­ing been first tested in an­i­mals, with out­landish the­o­ries.</p>
    <p>She warns that vac­cines and “an­cil­lary products” such as health apps could be used to “cre­ate a new species” that could be hooked up to “an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence in­ter­face”. The video ends with a tear­ful plea from Dr Madej to her view­ers, whom she urges to “start flood­ing so­cial me­dia with this”.</p>
    <p>ON­LINE BAT­TLE, PUB­LIC OPINION</p>
    <p>Dr Madej is right about one thing: the bat­tle to shape pub­lic opinion on vac­cines will be won or lost on­line, ac­cord­ing to Ge­orge Washington Uni­ver­sity physics pro­fes­sor Neil John­son.</p>
    <p>He re­cently pub­lished a pa­per in the sci­en­tific jour­nal Na­ture con­clud­ing that the an­ti­vac­ci­na­tion move­ment was win­ning the on­line in­for­ma­tion war be­cause it was or­gan­ised around smaller “clus­ters” that were able to in­fil­trate groups of un­de­cided peo­ple. He says the move­ment has its roots in the anti-vac­ci­na­tion sen­ti­ment to­wards measles jabs that has sur­faced in re­cent years, and which has been blamed for a spate of out­breaks.</p>
    <p>“Since 2019, the (anti-vac­ci­na­tion) com­mu­ni­ties have grown enor­mously and it’s al­most like the whole thing is in some sort of over­drive, it’s kind of on steroids,” he says. “It’s the par­ent­ing groups, the school par­ents’ as­so­ci­a­tions – peo­ple who would never usu­ally talk about vac­cines, but now they are ab­so­lutely en­gaged.”</p>
    <p>Ad­min­is­tra­tors of the on­line groups are fo­cused on the news­flow sur­round­ing vac­cines and quick to seize on de­vel­op­ments that can be used to sup­port their stance. Ear­lier this month, anti-vaxxer Face­book groups lit up with the news that As­traZeneca had se­cured pro­tec­tion from li­a­bil­ity claims re­lated to its vac­cines; the ad­min­is­tra­tors pre­sented it as proof that the drug­maker knows the jab will cause se­ri­ous side ef­fects and is try­ing to in­dem­nify it­self.</p>
    <p>Anti-vac­ci­na­tion groups also have a pro­lif­er­a­tion of dif­fer­ent mes­sages that ap­peal to dif­fer­ent peo­ple, notes Prof John­son, in­clud­ing safety fears; doubts over whether Covid-19 re­ally poses a risk, es­pe­cially to young peo­ple and chil­dren; scep­ti­cism over the role of the pharma in­dus­try and stan­dard-bear­ers for vac­ci­na­tions like Mr Gates; and a gen­eral mis­trust of science.</p>
    <p>Even if an un­de­cided per­son is not swayed by all of th­ese ar­gu­ments, just one is enough to make him or her hes­i­tant, he says.</p>
    <p>“They each have dif­fer­ent flavours ver­sus the pro-vac­ci­na­tion vanilla mes­sage which is just, ‘have your vac­cine, it’s good for you’.”</p>
    <p>One ques­tion that con­cerns pub­lic health ex­perts is how much the anti-vac­ci­na­tion move­ment is grow­ing or­gan­i­cally and how much it is be­ing stoked by a small but well-or­gan­ised and well-funded group of ac­tivists.</p>
    <p>A study last year found that most anti-vac­ci­na­tion ad­ver­tise­ments on Face­book stemmed from two sources: a Cal­i­for­nian or­gan­i­sa­tion called Stop Manda­tory Vac­ci­na­tion and The World Mer­cury Project, headed by Mr Robert F. Kennedy Jr, son of for­mer sen­a­tor Robert F. Kennedy and an anti-vac­ci­na­tion cam­paigner.</p>
    <p>Stop Manda­tory Vac­ci­na­tion is run by Mr Larry Cook, who de­scribes him­self as a “nat­u­ral liv­ing” ad­vo­cate who so­lic­its do­na­tions on his web­site for the cause, which go di­rectly into his per­sonal bank ac­count, ac­cord­ing to his web­site.</p>
    <p>HOW TO COUNTER ANTI-VAX MES­SAGES</p>
    <p>Who­ever is be­hind the in­crease in anti-vac­ci­na­tion sen­ti­ment, pub­lic health of­fi­cials in the US know they have to act fast to halt it if they want to en­sure any Covid-19 vac­cine pro­vides herd im­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Part of that is about com­mu­ni­ca­tion. Prof John­son warns that un­less sup­port­ers of vac­ci­na­tions can counter the anti-vaxxers with “guer­rilla mar­ket­ing” that reaches peo­ple on­line, they run the risk of los­ing the bat­tle over im­mu­ni­sa­tion:</p>
    <p>“Oth­er­wise, I think it’s a lost cause.”</p>
    <p>Re­searchers sug­gest other tac­tics too. A re­port by Johns Hop­kins Uni­ver­sity last month rec­om­mended de­liv­er­ing vac­cines in more fa­mil­iar sur­round­ings rather than hos­pi­tals and large health cen­tres, as well as mak­ing sure ad­vo­cacy cam­paigns are led by com­mu­nity lead­ers rather than just doc­tors.</p>
    <p>How­ever, many pub­lic health ex­perts fear that gov­ern­ment com­pul­sion is un­likely to be ef­fec­tive and warn that heavy polic­ing of vac­cine up­take could back­fire.</p>
    <p>“It would be very dif­fi­cult to push peo­ple to get vac­ci­nated with heavy gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion,” says Dr Bloom. “If you can­not even man­date face masks, how are you go­ing to man­date that peo­ple take a per­sonal risk with a vac­cine? I can’t imag­ine that be­ing po­lit­i­cally vi­able.”</p>
    <p>Oth­ers be­lieve the cur­rent surge in peo­ple ex­press­ing doubts over a Covid-19 vac­cine will dis­si­pate once one be­comes a re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>Dr Fineberg says many of the vac­cines that have at­tracted op­po­si­tion in the past were for dis­eases that had been all but erad­i­cated, lead­ing to a sense of com­pla­cency, whereas the coro­n­avirus is a near and present dan­ger.</p>
    <p>“The big dif­fer­ence with Covid-19 is that it’s not in­vis­i­ble. It is highly feared and enor­mously dis­rup­tive. One of the key in­gre­di­ents that feeds the gen­eral anti-vaxxer move­ment – the in­vis­i­bil­ity of the health threat – is miss­ing in Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>He also points to the fact that drug­mak­ers have been able to quickly en­rol vol­un­teers for tri­als of their vac­cines as a sign that the anti-vaxxer move­ment might not be as strong as some fear. “Thou­sands of peo­ple, mostly young and healthy, have said, ‘Yes, I’ll vol­un­teer, I’ll be the guinea pig.’”</p>
    <p>He sug­gests that schools, uni­ver­si­ties and em­ploy­ers might have more suc­cess than the gov­ern­ment in spurring vac­ci­na­tions, es­pe­cially if they in­sist stu­dents and work­ers get vac­ci­nated as a pre­con­di­tion of at­tend­ing places of work or ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>“If Congress ex­tended vac­cine li­a­bil­ity pro­tec­tions to any in­sti­tu­tion that re­quires it and in­su­lated them, that would change the equa­tion,” he says.</p>
    <p>Such a move would not be enough to change Ms McVay’s mind. If her son’s uni­ver­sity were to in­sist on his vac­ci­na­tion be­fore he could at­tend classes, “I think my ad­vice to him would be to sit out a se­mes­ter”, she says.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns about vac­ci­na­tions vary from coun­try to coun­try, but they are of­ten held by peo­ple not nor­mally associated with fringe views or con­spir­acy the­o­ries. Many are highly ed­u­cated and they are just as likely to be lib­eral as con­ser­va­tive.</p>
