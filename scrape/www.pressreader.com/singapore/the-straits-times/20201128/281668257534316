    <p>DUBAI • An Ira­nian sci­en­tist long sus­pected by the West of mas­ter­mind­ing a se­cret nu­clear bomb pro­gramme was killed in an am­bush near Teheran yes­ter­day, an in­ci­dent that is likely to pro­voke a con­fronta­tion be­tween Iran and its foes in the last weeks of Mr Don­ald Trump’s pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>The mil­i­tary ad­viser to Ira­nian Supreme Leader Ay­a­tol­lah Ali Khamenei vowed to strike against the killers of Dr Mohsen Fakhrizade­h, who died of in­juries in hospi­tal after armed as­sas­sins fired on his car, state me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>“We will strike as thun­der at the killers of this op­pressed martyr and will make them re­gret their ac­tion,” tweeted Mr Hos­sein De­hghan, also a mil­i­tary com­man­der.</p>
    <p>The Tas­nim and Fars news agen­cies, both close to se­cu­rity sources, said the at­tack took place in Ab­sard city in Teheran prov­ince’s east­ern Da­ma­vand county, with “ter­ror­ists bomb­ing a car be­fore shoot­ing at Dr Fakhrizade­h’s car”.</p>
    <p>“Un­for­tu­nately, the med­i­cal team did not suc­ceed in re­viv­ing him, and a few min­utes ago, this man­ager and sci­en­tist achieved the high sta­tus of mar­tyr­dom after years of ef­fort and strug­gle,” a state­ment by Iran’s armed forces car­ried by state me­dia said.</p>
    <p>Iran’s For­eign Min­is­ter Mohammad Javad Zarif con­demned the killing as “an act of state ter­ror”.</p>
    <p>Dr Fakhrizade­h is thought to have headed what the United Na­tions nu­clear watch­dog and US in­tel­li­gence ser­vices be­lieve was a co­or­di­nated covert nu­clear weapons pro­gramme in Iran that was shelved in 2003.</p>
    <p>Iran has long de­nied seek­ing to weaponise nu­clear en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Who­ever is re­spon­si­ble for the at­tack, it is cer­tain to es­ca­late ten­sion be­tween Iran and the United States in the fi­nal weeks of Mr Trump’s pres­i­dency.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who lost his re-elec­tion bid on Nov 3 and leaves of­fice on Jan 20, has re­peat­edly ac­cused Iran of se­cretly seek­ing nu­clear weapons.</p>
    <p>He pulled the US out of a deal un­der which sanc­tions on Iran were lifted in re­turn for curbs on its nu­clear pro­gramme. Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has said he would re­store it. A US of­fi­cial con­firmed ear­lier this month that Mr Trump had sought from mil­i­tary aides a plan for a pos­si­ble strike on Iran, but had de­cided against it at that time.</p>
    <p>Dr Fakhrizade­h had the rare dis­tinc­tion of be­ing the only Ira­nian sci­en­tist named in the In­ter­na­tional Atomic En­ergy Agency’s (IAEA) 2015 “fi­nal as­sess­ment” of open ques­tions about Iran’s nu­clear pro­gramme and whether it was aimed at de­vel­op­ing a nu­clear bomb.</p>
    <p>The IAEA’s re­port said he over­saw ac­tiv­i­ties “in sup­port of a pos­si­ble mil­i­tary di­men­sion to (Iran’s) nu­clear pro­gramme” within the so-called Amad (Hope) plan. Is­rael has de­scribed the Amad plan as Iran’s se­cret nu­clear weapons pro­gramme, and said it seized a large chunk of an Ira­nian nu­clear “ar­chive” de­tail­ing its work.</p>
    <p>“Re­mem­ber that name, Fakhrizade­h,” Is­raeli Prime Min­is­ter Benjamin Ne­tanyahu said in a 2018 speech re­veal­ing de­tails from the ar­chive, nam­ing Dr Fakhrizade­h as Amad’s chief.</p>
    <p>Mr Ne­tanyahu said that after Amad was shut down, Dr Fakhrizade­h con­tin­ued work­ing at an or­gan­i­sa­tion within Iran’s De­fence Min­istry on “spe­cial projects”.</p>
