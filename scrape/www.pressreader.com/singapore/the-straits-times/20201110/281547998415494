    <p>More than 50 or­gan­i­sa­tions have ex­pressed in­ter­est in Sin­ga­pore Air­lines’ (SIA) train­ing pro­grammes launched last week which will see the national car­rier’s train­ers work with com­pa­nies to de­sign cour­ses and in­struct their em­ploy­ees in ar­eas such as cus­tomer ser­vice.</p>
    <p>More than 50 or­gan­i­sa­tions have ex­pressed in­ter­est in Sin­ga­pore Air­lines’ (SIA) train­ing pro­grammes launched last week which will see the national car­rier’s train­ers work with com­pa­nies to de­sign cour­ses and in­struct their em­ploy­ees in ar­eas such as cus­tomer ser­vice.</p>
    <p>SIA chief ex­ec­u­tive Goh Choon Phong pro­vided the up­date yes­ter­day, as he laid out the group’s busi­ness strat­egy af­ter it re­ported nearly $3.5 bil­lion in losses for the six months to Septem­ber last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>He said the new train­ing pro­grammes were one of SIA’s in­no­va­tions to cope with the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus on the air­line.</p>
    <p>This, to­gether with cost-cut­ting mea­sures and other ven­tures to in­crease rev­enue, like the hugely pop­u­lar A-380 din­ing ex­pe­ri­ence that was quickly sold out re­cently, has en­abled the air­line to re­duce its bleed­ing from a rate of about $350 mil­lion a month in July to $300 mil­lion now.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh said: “We will con­tinue to be very nim­ble and flex­i­ble to see what other op­por­tu­ni­ties the mar­ket may bring... The mar­ket is very dy­namic at the mo­ment.”</p>
    <p>The losses suf­fered in the six months to Septem­ber have been pri­mar­ily at­trib­uted to the mas­sive fall in pas­sen­ger num­bers since Covid-19 hit. The group was op­er­at­ing at about 9.5 per cent of preCovid-19 pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity last month, and hopes for it to re­turn to 16 per cent by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>It has re­lied on the trans­port of cargo to mit­i­gate the fall­out, even re­mov­ing seats on planes to in­crease stor­age space on flights that are half-empty.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh said he re­mained hope­ful that with new Covid-19 quick­test­ing regimes, more pas­sen­ger flights could take to the skies.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, the up­com­ing air travel bub­ble with Hong Kong, which will al­low peo­ple on both sides to travel with­out quar­an­tine, stay-home no­tices or con­trolled itin­er­ar­ies, is “a very good ex­am­ple of how we can ac­tu­ally open up and travel in a safe man­ner”, he said.</p>
    <p>“All of th­ese travel ar­range­ments are sup­ported by ad­vances in test­ing pro­to­cols and the abil­ity to test in the mar­ket. We be­lieve that the con­tin­u­ous in­vest­ment in all th­ese test schemes and ap­proaches would fur­ther ease travel go­ing for­ward.”</p>
    <p>But he also cau­tioned that a sec­ond or third virus wave would wipe out th­ese achieve­ments.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, SIA will fo­cus on strength­en­ing its fi­nan­cial po­si­tion through schemes like the sale or leas­ing of its air­craft, although it has yet to de­cide whether to is­sue an ad­di­tional $6.2 bil­lion worth of manda­tory con­vert­ible bonds.</p>
    <p>It will also strive for op­er­a­tions to be more en­vi­ron­men­tally sus­tain­able, in line with its com­mit­ment to re­duce car­bon emis­sions.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, it is look­ing at us­ing more biodegrad­able ma­te­rial like bam­boo for its cut­lery and pa­per for its con­tain­ers, which can re­duce the weight of food trays by more than 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>It has also in­stalled more than 9,700 so­lar pan­els at its of­fices.</p>
