    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s le­gal sys­tem is work­ing well, and strikes a bal­ance be­tween spe­cial­i­sa­tion and in­te­gra­tion in the le­gal ser­vice, said Min­is­ter for Law and Home Af­fairs K. Shan­mugam.</p>
    <p>There are also safe­guards for ju­di­cial in­de­pen­dence, and judges with pros­e­cu­to­rial ex­pe­ri­ence will bring fur­ther ex­per­tise to their work, he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam was re­spond­ing in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day to Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mount­bat­ten), who had asked how many judges in the State Courts were for­mer prosecutor­s in the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers, and if the Law Min­istry would re­view its pol­icy on the sep­a­ra­tion of du­ties in the le­gal ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of of­fi­cers in the le­gal ser­vice and ju­di­ciary, ex­clud­ing High Court judges, is 801 – a rel­a­tively small num­ber, Mr Shan­mugam said.</p>
    <p>In this con­text, there may be ques­tions about why of­fi­cers are posted be­tween the State Courts and other parts of the le­gal ser­vice, he added.</p>
    <p>He said: “Can there be in­de­pen­dence, if they are li­able to be cross­posted?”</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam said the Le­gal Ser­vice Com­mis­sion be­lieves that ro­ta­tion pro­vides ac­cess to a larger pool of tal­ent, helps its of­fi­cers be­come more well-rounded, and gives the sys­tem flex­i­bil­ity to ac­com­mo­date of­fi­cers who want to try dif­fer­ent types of work.</p>
    <p>All move­ments in the le­gal ser­vice are over­seen by per­son­nel boards and/or com­mit­tees, which are chaired by the Chief Jus­tice and the Le­gal Ser­vice Com­mis­sion, of which the Chief Jus­tice is pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Mr Shan­mugam also re­sponded to Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai’s ques­tion on whether the trial process can be ex­pe­dited for eco­nom­i­cally vul­ner­a­ble for­eign na­tion­als.</p>
    <p>If cases are ex­pe­dited for for­eign­ers, then Sin­ga­pore­ans ac­cused of crimes will have to wait much longer, he said.</p>
    <p>Now, there are 55 judges at the State Courts han­dling about 600 crim­i­nal tri­als each year – which is a heavy load. About 22 per cent of these cases in­volved for­eign­ers, Mr Shan­mugam said.</p>
    <p>He added that the me­dian time taken for crim­i­nal tri­als in the State Courts – from the time a per­son is charged in court to the judg­ment be­ing de­liv­ered – is 15 months.</p>
    <p>This de­pends on var­i­ous fac­tors such as the na­ture of the case, the avail­abil­ity of lawyers, as well as doc­u­ments and wit­nesses.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong also asked about the in­ter­pre­ta­tion ser­vices avail­able in the Sin­ga­pore Po­lice Force. Mr Shan­mugam replied that there is a pool of in­ter­preters avail­able for the three of­fi­cial work­ing lan­guages as well as the more com­mon lo­cal di­alects. For for­eign lan­guages, in­ter­preters are en­gaged on an ad hoc ba­sis.</p>
    <p>In­ter­preters are used when in­ter­vie­wees are un­able to un­der­stand in­ter­view­ers, or vice versa, he said. There is a frame­work to as­sess the suit­abil­ity of in­ter­preters, which in­cludes their qual­i­fi­ca­tions and rel­e­vant work ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>In the spe­cific case of for­mer maid Parti Liyani, she was asked and said she could speak in Malay, Mr Shan­mugam said.</p>
    <p>“The point is whether the in­ter­vie­wee un­der­stands the lan­guage be­ing used, and as I said ear­lier, the po­lice have been told they must check this,” he added.</p>
