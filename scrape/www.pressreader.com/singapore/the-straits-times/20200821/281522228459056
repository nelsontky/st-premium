    <p>The Yangtze River’s wa­ter level in Chongqing mu­nic­i­pal­ity ex­ceeded his­tor­i­cal highs yes­ter­day and hit 191.55m, pos­ing an un­prece­dented threat to the me­trop­o­lis in south-west China. The city has been flooded since Mon­day due to re­cent heavy down­pours in the Sichuan Basin in the up­per reaches of the Yangtze. WORLD</p>
    <p>CHONGQING • The Yangtze River’s wa­ter level in Chongqing mu­nic­i­pal­ity ex­ceeded a his­tor­i­cal high yes­ter­day morn­ing, pos­ing an un­prece­dented threat to the me­trop­o­lis in south-west China.</p>
    <p>Around 8am yes­ter­day, the wa­ter level at the Cun­tan hy­dro­logic sta­tion in Chongqing reached 191.55m – 14cm higher than the record in 1981 – and was still ris­ing.</p>
    <p>Chongqing, lo­cated in the up­per reaches of China’s big­gest river, up­graded its flood-con­trol re­sponse to Level I on Tues­day, the high­est rung in the coun­try’s fourtier emer­gency re­sponse sys­tem for floods.</p>
    <p>At least 250,000 Chongqing res­i­dents have been re­lo­cated to safe places.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to t he Chongqing Emer­gency Re­sponse Bureau, the wa­ter level at Cun­tan was higher than the dev­as­tat­ing flood which left 1.5 mil­lion peo­ple home­less in 1981.</p>
    <p>More than 8,660 sq km of arable land was flooded.</p>
    <p>The di­rect eco­nomic loss caused by the floods was about two bil­lion yuan.</p>
    <p>Since Mon­day, Chongqing, which is lo­cated in the up­per Yangtze wa­ter­shed, has been hit by heavy flood­ing for the fifth time this year due to heavy down­pours in the up­per Yangtze re­gion.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in Hubei prov­ince – Chongqing’s eastern neigh­bour– the author­i­ties warned that the Three Gorges reser­voir in the prov­ince would see the most se­vere round of floods since it started to hold wa­ter in 2003.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a fore­cast by the Changjiang Wa­ter Re­sources Com­mis­sion of the Min­istry of Wa­ter Re­sources, the in­bound flow of wa­ter is ex­pected to reach more than 74,000 cu­bic m per sec­ond after con­tin­u­ous heavy rain bat­tered the up­per reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
    <p>The river flows for 6,300km from glaciers in the Qing­hai-Ti­bet Plateau through Chongqing, and then to Wuhan in Hubei prov­ince and Nan­jing in Jiangsu prov­ince, be­fore reach­ing the East China Sea at Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>The Three Gorges pro­ject is a multi-func­tional wa­ter-con­trol sys­tem con­sist­ing of a 2,309m-long and 185m-high dam, a five-tier ship lock on the north and south, and 34 turbo-gen­er­a­tors with a com­bined gen­er­at­ing ca­pac­ity of 22.5 mil­lion kilo­watts.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese gov­ern­ment has ear­marked 460 mil­lion yuan (S$91 mil­lion) for flood re­lief in the Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Chongqing re­gions, said the Min­istry of Emer­gency Man­age­ment on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The funds would be used for flood con­trol, emer­gency res­cue and post-dis­as­ter re­con­struc­tion in the af­fected ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it has sent a team of 500 dis­as­ter-re­lief pro­fes­sion­als to Sichuan to aid in lo­cal flood con­trol and emer­gency res­cue work.</p>
