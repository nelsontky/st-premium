    <p>The $400,000 Group 1 Raf­fles Cup over 1,600m will now be run on Oct 10, in­stead of Sept 19, re­vealed the Sin­ga­pore Turf Club (STC) yes­ter­day, as it an­nounced new dates for its re­main­ing fea­ture races for the year.</p>
    <p>The STC said the new date will pro­vide a gap of two weeks from the Sin­ga­pore Guineas, which al­lows the win­ner and place-get­ters of the 1,600m fea­ture to also take part in the Raf­fles Cup.</p>
    <p>The $400,000 Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Guineas was post­poned from July 26 to Sept 26 due to the coronaviru­s pandemic, which shut down racing for three months, from early April to July 11.</p>
    <p>Among the top races resched­uled were the $1 mil­lion Group 1 Kranji Mile and the $500,000 Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Derby, which were won by Ara­maayo on Aug 16 and Top Knight last Satur­day re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>The $400,000 Group 1 Queen El­iz­a­beth II Cup over 1,800m will now be staged two weeks later, from Oct 17 to Oct 31.</p>
    <p>Ditto the $1 mil­lion Group 1 Sin­ga­pore Gold Cup over 2,000m, from Nov 7 to Nov 21.</p>
    <p>“This sched­ule will pro­vide a smooth se­quence over Oc­to­ber and Novem­ber for po­ten­tial run­ners of these fea­ture races to step up i n dis­tance over 1,600m, 1,800m and 2,000m,” said the STC.</p>
    <p>The Lion City Cup over 1,200m is moved to Oct 25 “in the ab­sence of a sprint fea­ture race dur­ing this pe­riod, adding bal­ance to the racing fix­ture”.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally, the $400,000 Group 1 race was sched­uled for May 23, the same day as the first Kranji Mile date.</p>
    <p>The $250,000 Group 2 EW Barker Tro­phy over 1,400m is now on Nov 15, in­stead of Nov 7.</p>
    <p>The Group 3 $125,000 Sin­ga­pore Golden Horse­shoe, a 1,200m race for two-year-olds, is moved to Dec 5, from July 26.</p>
    <p>This gives the young horses more time to grow and ma­ture, said the STC.</p>
    <p>The fi­nal fea­ture – the $150,000 Group 3 Colo­nial Chief Stakes over the Poly­track 1,600m – is now on Dec 19, from Dec 5.</p>
    <p>The STC also an­nounced that Sin­ga­pore racing will con­tinue for the full month of De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally, the sea­son was to end on Dec 5, giv­ing the fra­ter­nity a four-week break be­fore racing re­sumes on New Year’s Day.</p>
