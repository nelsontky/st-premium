    <p>BEIJING • A frigid win­ter is lead­ing to power short­ages in parts of China, driv­ing up de­mand for diesel, as fac­to­ries rush to in­stall gen­er­a­tors to keep the lights on.</p>
    <p>Some prov­inces have started ra­tioning elec­tric­ity to in­dus­trial and com­mer­cial users to en­sure there is enough power to heat homes dur­ing a colder-than-nor­mal win­ter.</p>
    <p>That is prompt­ing fac­to­ries to snap up por­ta­ble gen­er­a­tors and the diesel they run on to en­sure plants stay open to meet or­ders amid record-high ex­ports.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal au­thor­ity ear­lier is­sued an orange alert na­tion­wide – the sec­ond­high­est level in its four-tier sys­tem – as a cold wave sweeps through the na­tion. With tem­per­a­tures still ex­pected to dip fur­ther, grid op­er­a­tors are pri­ori­tis­ing the sup­ply of en­ergy to homes and the com­mu­nity, leav­ing other clients to scram­ble for al­ter­na­tive power sources.</p>
    <p>“Power cuts have brought us ex­tra or­ders,” Ms Huang Yu, a sales man­ager at Shan­dong Dianyuan Vil­lage Power Tech­nol­ogy, which sup­plies gen­er­a­tors. “We have been quite busy since Novem­ber, re­ceiv­ing non-stop or­ders from cus­tomers in Jiangsu and Zhe­jiang.”</p>
    <p>The firm, which has a wide range of gen­er­a­tors in­clud­ing some large enough to power a small town, has sold more than 20 a day re­cently, more than triple the nor­mal level, Ms Huang said. Its so­cial me­dia ac­count posted a video on Dec 17 show­ing trucks load­ing dozens of power gen­er­a­tors for ship­ment to re­gions suf­fer­ing power cuts.</p>
    <p>Whole­sale diesel prices in China rose to the high­est level since April, based on data from the Na­tional Bureau of Sta­tis­tics.</p>
    <p>In­ven­to­ries of the fuel across the coun­try fell 5.26 per cent, in the month to Dec 25, to 20.76 mil­lion tonnes, ac­cord­ing to in­for­ma­tion provider OilChem.</p>
    <p>“Even 0.5 per cent of China’s elec­tric­ity switch­ing to power by diesel would make a large im­pact on diesel de­mand,” said an­a­lyst Tee Seng-Yick from Beijing-based SIA En­ergy.</p>
    <p>China’s power de­mand surged in the sec­ond half of last year as its econ­omy re­cov­ered from the Covid-19 pan­demic and global de­mand for pro­tec­tive gear and med­i­cal equip­ment it pro­duces soared.</p>
    <p>A colder-than-nor­mal win­ter caused by a La Nina weather pat­tern added to that, boost­ing con­sump­tion by 11 per cent last month, more than dou­ble the growth of a year ago, said the Na­tional De­vel­op­ment and Re­form Com­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Coal sup­plies have also been tight amid im­port re­stric­tions and safety checks at do­mes­tic mines, and nat­u­ral gas has been ra­tioned to en­sure sup­plies for heat­ing. Diesel gen­er­a­tors are of­ten used as back­ups be­cause the fuel is easy to find and rel­a­tively cheap.</p>
