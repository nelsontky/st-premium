    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK In May, with most global sports com­pe­ti­tions sus­pended be­cause of the pan­demic, veter­ans Dustin Johnson, Rory McIl­roy and Rickie Fowler com­peted in a made-for-TV char­ity golf match.</p>
    <p>Al­most as a lark, or per­haps to lure a younger au­di­ence, Matthew Wolff, a 21-year-old PGA Tour new­comer, was in­vited to play, too.</p>
    <p>At the time, he was known mostly for his pe­cu­liar pre-shot twitch, his quirky swing and his long drives, and he clearly ap­peared ner­vous at the start as he sprayed shots around the course.</p>
    <p>But his pres­ence was charm­ing, like an over­anx­ious kid brother who none­the­less puts ev­ery­one at ease. At one point, in mock de­ri­sion, McIl­roy re­ferred to him as “young­ster”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Satur­day’s third round of the US Open, in which Wolff shot a five-un­der 65 for a five-un­der 205 to­tal to take a two-stroke lead, the Ul­ster­man chose dif­fer­ent words when de­scrib­ing his friend.</p>
    <p>“That’s just awe­some golf,” the 31-year-old said of Wolff’s dy­namic play on Satur­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>“I mean, ev­ery­one knows how tal­ented Matt is.”</p>
    <p>Wolff has awell chance for a his­toric US Open vic­tory, but the Amer­i­can copes with his nerves by keep­ing his golf success in per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>The youngest 54-hole US Open leader since 1975, he could be­come the first player to win on his US Open de­but since am­a­teur Fran­cis Ouimet in 1913.</p>
    <p>And af­ter his share of fourth spot in his Ma­jor de­but at last month’s PGA Cham­pi­onship, there are few doubters that his early success is well earned.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­ally early in my ca­reer, but I feel like I have the game to win,” Wolff said. “I feel like I’m ready to win out here and win a Ma­jor.</p>
    <p>“I’ve al­ready won a PGA Tour event and I knew my game was in a re­ally good spot. I’ve been feel­ing re­ally good, re­ally con­fi­dent.</p>
    <p>“But I’m not go­ing to think about it too much and just go out there and do the same things I’ve done the last three days.”</p>
    <p>Wolff, a win­ner at Min­neapo­lis last year in his third PGA Tour start,</p>
    <p>has been think­ing about the stom­ach can­cer his agent has been bat­tling. Sud­denly his is­sues on the golf course are less sig­nif­i­cant.</p>
    <p>“It’s just golf, even though it is the US Open,” he said. “My agent, John, is strug­gling right now.</p>
    <p>“He doesn’t want any­one to feel bad for him, but it just puts things in per­spec­tive. And I’m go­ing to go out there, try to make him proud... he loves watch­ing me play golf.</p>
    <p>“It’s im­por­tant. It’s the US Open. But it’s just golf.”</p>
    <p>It was an­other dif­fi­cult day of scor­ing at Winged Foot as only seven play­ers man­aged to break par on a lay­out renowned for its nar­row fair­ways, thick rough and wildly un­du­lat­ing and speedy greens.</p>
    <p>Among those who strug­gled and faded from con­tention were for­mer world No. 1s Justin Thomas and Jon Rahm af­ter match­ing 76s.</p>
    <p>Bryson DeCham­beau (70), who be­gan one shot back of leader Pa­trick Reed, made a bo­gey-bo­gey start but leaned on his power to chase down Wolff. He squan­dered a chance to fin­ish within one stroke of the lead when he two-putted from six feet for a clos­ing bo­gey.</p>
    <p>For­mer Bri­tish Open cham­pion Louis Oosthuizen (68) was alone in third place, four shots back of Wolff, while Hideki Mat­suyama (70), Xan­der Schauf­fele (70) and Har­ris English (72) were a fur­ther stroke adrift.</p>
    <p>Four-time Ma­jor cham­pion McIl­roy was six shots back af­ter a 68.</p>
    <p>World No. 10 Reed (77) drained a nine-foot birdie at the ninth hole to share the lead. But he fell apart over a night­mar­ish in­ward nine, dur­ing which he made six bo­geys and a dou­ble bo­gey to fall into a tie for 11th place, eight shots back of Wolff.</p>
