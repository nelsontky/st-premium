    <p>These days, mem­bers of Malaysia’s pre-em­i­nent party, the United Malays Na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion (Umno), are feel­ing hot and both­ered.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing a pe­riod in the wilder­ness af­ter its 2018 de­feat, the party was brought into the gov­ern­ing coali­tion in late Fe­bru­ary af­ter the in­fa­mous “Sher­a­ton Move”, a back­room ma­noeu­vre that led to the oust­ing of Tun Dr Ma­hathir Mo­hamad’s Pakatan Hara­pan (PH) gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>While im­mea­sur­ably bet­ter than be­ing in op­po­si­tion, Umno’s cur­rent po­si­tion in the Perikatan Na­sional ad­min­is­tra­tion is rather un­ful­fill­ing.</p>
    <p>Wist­fully eye­ing the prime min­is­te­rial po­si­tion, its lead­ers are de­nied key Cabi­net port­fo­lios, over­looked for di­rec­tor­ships of gov­ern­ment-linked cor­po­ra­tions, and by­passed for chief min­is­ter­ships. In the words of a se­nior op­po­si­tion strate­gist, “long used to dom­i­nat­ing, Umno is exquisitel­y sen­si­tive to be­ing dom­i­nated”.</p>
    <p>To rub salt in the party’s wounds,</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir stated last month that Umno un­der cur­rent pres­i­dent Ahmad Zahid Hamidi is di­rec­tion­less and riven by fac­tion­al­ism. Like so many of the se­nior states­man’s acer­bic state­ments, this charge is largely true – but over­looks his own role in the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Many of Umno’s cur­rent ail­ments were ac­cen­tu­ated dur­ing Dr Ma­hathir’s party pres­i­dency in the 1980s and 1990s. Keenly aware of his own po­si­tion, he re­fused to groom his suc­ces­sors or pro­tect them from chal­lengers, in­stead en­cour­ag­ing his lieu­tenants to con­test against each other.</p>
    <p>The early pe­riod of his party lead­er­ship was rid­dled with pro­longed fac­tional bat­tles, such as those be­tween “Team A” and “Team B”. One lead­er­ship chal­lenge led to the party split­ting, with Dr Ma­hathir es­tab­lish­ing a new ver­sion of Umno (Umno Baru) in 1988 and mov­ing to ban the other or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Af­ter his pres­i­dency, Dr Ma­hathir also un­der­mined party unity by openly crit­i­cis­ing all of his suc­ces­sors at the head of the party and in gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>THE ALL-POW­ER­FUL PARTY PRES­I­DENT</p>
    <p>The party struc­ture that</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir helped de­velop has con­trib­uted to Umno’s cur­rent anomie in an­other way.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the 1987 party split and the found­ing of the “new” Umno, Dr Ma­hathir made it harder for bud­ding lead­ers to run against the party pres­i­dent, in­creased the power of the party leader over di­vi­sion chiefs, and gave the party’s apex body, the Supreme Coun­cil, the abil­ity to de­lay in­ter­nal elec­tions if needed.</p>
    <p>Thus, the levers of power in the hands of the party pres­i­dent make it al­most im­pos­si­ble to re­move a re­cal­ci­trant in­cum­bent.</p>
    <p>Dr Ma­hathir stepped down of his</p>
    <p>own vo­li­tion in 2003. His suc­ces­sor, Tun Ab­dul­lah Badawi, vol­un­tar­ily re­lin­quished the pres­i­dency once he felt he was no longer wanted.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Na­jib Razak’s long and con­tro­ver­sial reign in the face of pro­longed crit­i­cism from se­nior party lead­ers such as Dr Ma­hathir (again), cur­rent Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin, Datuk Seri Shafie Ap­dal and Datuk Seri Mukhriz Ma­hathir is tes­ta­ment to the strength of the party pres­i­dency. It lit­er­ally took an elec­toral earth­quake to drive</p>
    <p>Na­jib from gov­ern­ment in or­der to force him to re­sign as Umno leader – hand­ing the in­terim lead­er­ship to then deputy pres­i­dent Zahid.</p>
    <p>And it was the link be­tween the Umno party pres­i­dent and the di­vi­sion chiefs that ob­vi­ated any mean­ing­ful soul-search­ing or or­gan­i­sa­tional re­form in the wake of the 2018 de­feat.</p>
    <p>De­spite calls for re­form and lead­er­ship re­newal, in­cum­bency car­ried the day, as di­vi­sion heads loyal to Na­jib threw their sup­port be­hind Zahid, by­pass­ing veteran Tengku Raza­leigh Hamzah and the re­formist Khairy Ja­malud­din in the process.</p>
    <p>The op­por­tu­nity for re­form and re­newal was missed, and the party</p>
    <p>be­gan its drift right­ward. Search­ing for a nar­ra­tive, Umno fo­cused on eth­nona­tion­al­ism as it was de­prived of cred­i­ble al­ter­na­tives.</p>
    <p>Due to the 1MDB (1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had) scan­dal, the party could not cred­i­bly run on a record of good gov­er­nance, nor could it point to its past record of eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment, as the per­son most as­so­ci­ated with that – Dr Ma­hathir – was now the leader of its elec­toral neme­sis, PH.</p>
    <p>In­deed, sens­ing blood, Dr Ma­hathir en­ticed and ca­joled a sub­stan­tial por­tion of Umno MPs to jump ship – fur­ther ex­ac­er­bat­ing his for­mer party’s vul­ner­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>While Umno’s po­lit­i­cal for­tunes have since im­proved, its par­tial ac­cess to power has fur­ther di­vided the party.</p>
    <p>Those who are closer to Tan Sri Muhyid­din and have Cabi­net po­si­tions are loath to lose them. In con­trast, those fac­ing cor­rup­tion cases and de­prived of any po­si­tions want to head to a gen­eral elec­tion now – in the hope that an en­larged Umno ma­jor­ity in Par­lia­ment would be to their ben­e­fit.</p>
    <p>THE FAC­TIONS AT CROSS PUR­POSES</p>
    <p>Let us turn then to these in­tra-party fac­tions. The first is as­so­ci­ated with Datuk Seri Hisham­mud­din</p>
    <p>Hussein, the Min­is­ter of For­eign Af­fairs and son of Malaysia’s third prime min­is­ter and grand­son of Umno’s founder.</p>
    <p>De­spite hav­ing been a close ally (and cousin) of Na­jib, he quit all se­nior party po­si­tions fol­low­ing the 2018 de­feat.</p>
    <p>Mr Hisham­mud­din en­joys good rap­port with Mr Muhyid­din and is one of the sup­posed mas­ter­minds of the Sher­a­ton Move that led to the fall of PH. He is from the Umno heart­land of Jo­hor and is as­so­ci­ated with a group of Cabi­net mem­bers from the same state. The po­lit­i­cal blue blood is a nat­u­ral can­di­date for the party’s lead­er­ship and con­se­quently ben­e­fits from re­main­ing in Cabi­net and bid­ing his time.</p>
    <p>The next vis­i­ble fac­tion com­prises a group of mod­er­ates that is said to clus­ter largely, but not ex­clu­sively, around Umno deputy pres­i­dent Mo­hamad</p>
    <p>Hasan.</p>
    <p>Many are based in more ur­ban and mixed con­stituen­cies in the cen­tre and south of the penin­sula, and a num­ber were hit by the ur­ban swing against Barisan Na­sional in 2018. While count­ing sev­eral pop­u­lar mem­bers such as Datuk Seri Mo­hamed Khaled Nordin and Mr Khairy among their ranks, this group is not very co­he­sive and is not that pow­er­ful at the party’s apex.</p>
    <p>The third fac­tion is said to com­prise the “old guard” or “main­stream”, per­son­i­fied by</p>
    <p>Zahid and Na­jib. Many of this group hold high-level po­si­tions in the party and also face cor­rup­tion cases.</p>
    <p>Be­yond the cur­rent and for­mer party pres­i­dent, this fac­tion in­cludes sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ahmad Maslan, trea­surer Tengku Ad­nan and vice-pres­i­dent Mahdzir</p>
    <p>Khalid.</p>
    <p>Some mem­bers of this group are less con­tro­ver­sial and have been awarded Cabi­net po­si­tions. They in­clude Datuk Seri Is­mail Sabri Yaakob, Tan Sri An­nuar Musa and Datuk Sham­sul Anuar Nasarah, who are the min­is­ters of De­fence, Fed­eral Ter­ri­to­ries, and En­ergy and Nat­u­ral Re­sources, re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Yet, it is worth not­ing that even within this group, there are di­vi­sions. Be­yond those with Cabi­net po­si­tions and com­pany di­rec­tor­ships on one side, and those fac­ing lengthy court pro­cesses on the other, there are also strate­gic dif­fer­ences.</p>
    <p>Na­jib, al­ready con­victed of one set of charges and fac­ing a bar­rage more, has burned his bridges with all se­nior po­lit­i­cal fig­ures, in­clud­ing Dr Ma­hathir, Mr Muhyid­din and PH leader An­war Ibrahim. He has lit­tle op­tion but to tip the ap­ple cart and shoot for early polls.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Zahid has a work­ing re­la­tion­ship with Mr Muhyid­din, a close per­sonal re­la­tion­ship with Datuk Seri An­war, and a num­ber of Cabi­net mem­bers who owe him favours. He may yet har­bour hopes of a ne­go­ti­ated so­lu­tion to his le­gal woes.</p>
    <p>Par­tially in gov­ern­ment and en­joy­ing the perks – yet tempted by hopes of a stronger hand in Par­lia­ment – Umno has yet to de­cide whether it stays or goes.</p>
    <p>While the party is an in­flu­en­tial force, it is be­set by in­ter­nal con­tra­dic­tions that have built up over the decades, in­clud­ing un­der Dr Ma­hathir’s watch. Umno today shows that not only are there no per­ma­nent en­e­mies or friends, but even in­ter­ests are mu­ta­ble.</p>
