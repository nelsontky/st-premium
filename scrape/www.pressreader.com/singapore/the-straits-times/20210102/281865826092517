    <p>TAIPEI • Tai­wan is ready to have “mean­ing­ful” talks with China as equals as long as they are will­ing to put aside con­fronta­tion, Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen said yes­ter­day, of­fer­ing another olive branch to Bei­jing in her New Year’s speech.</p>
    <p>Demo­cratic Tai­wan, claimed by China as its sov­er­eign ter­ri­tory, has come un­der in­creas­ing pres­sure from Bei­jing, which has ramped up mil­i­tary ac­tiv­ity near the is­land.</p>
    <p>China, an­gered at grow­ing Amer­i­can sup­port for the self-gov­erned is­land, says it is re­spond­ing to “col­lu­sion” be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Taipei.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing views US sup­port for the is­land as a pre­cur­sor to Tai­wan declar­ing for­mal in­de­pen­dence, a red line for China.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the pres­i­den­tial of­fice, Ms Tsai said that in the past year, Chi­nese mil­i­tary ac­tiv­i­ties near Tai­wan had threat­ened peace and sta­bil­ity in the Indo-Pa­cific re­gion.</p>
    <p>“I want to re­it­er­ate, that when it comes to cross-strait re­la­tions we will not ad­vance rashly and will stick to our prin­ci­ples,” Ms Tsai said.</p>
    <p>“As long as the Bei­jing au­thor­i­ties are de­ter­mined to defuse an­tag­o­nism and im­prove cross-strait re­la­tions, in line with the prin­ci­ples of rec­i­proc­ity and dig­nity, we are will­ing to jointly pro­mote mean­ing­ful dia­logue,” she added, echo­ing com­ments she made last Oc­to­ber in her na­tional day speech.</p>
    <p>China, which cut off a for­mal mech­a­nism for talks in 2016 af­ter Ms Tsai first won of­fice, has re­peat­edly re­jected her ad­vances, say­ing she has to first ac­cept that Tai­wan is part of China, some­thing Ms Tsai has re­fused to do.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai also ex­pressed her hope that once the Covid-19 epi­demic is un­der con­trol, “nor­mal and or­derly ex­changes to in­crease un­der­stand­ing and re­duce mis­un­der­stand­ings” be­tween peo­ple on both sides of the Tai­wan Strait can re­sume.</p>
    <p>Switch­ing to English, Ms Tsai said she was deeply grate­ful for the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity’s con­tin­ued back­ing for Tai­wan, adding: “Our democ­racy is stronger be­cause of your sup­port.”</p>
    <p>While there was no di­rect re­sponse from Bei­jing, Mr Liu Jieyi, the head of China’s Tai­wan Af­fairs Of­fice, said in his New Year’s mes­sage that they would stand by the “one China” prin­ci­ple.</p>
    <p>“Only by elim­i­nat­ing the scourge of ‘Tai­wan in­de­pen­dence’ can there be peace and sta­bil­ity in the Tai­wan Strait,” he said.</p>
