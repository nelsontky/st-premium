    <p>With the re­open­ing of Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy – and show-flats – on June 19, new home sales posted a sur­prise re­bound last month as pent-up de­mand was un­leashed.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is un­der­go­ing its worst re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence, but de­vel­op­ers sold 998 non-landed pri­vate homes last month, up 105 per cent from May, when 487 pri­vate homes were trans­acted.</p>
    <p>It was also the high­est num­ber of monthly sales recorded for June in seven years, and seems to in­di­cate re­silience in the prop­erty mar­ket de­spite the re­ces­sion and the ab­sence of ma­jor new launches.</p>
    <p>New units booked last month saw an in­crease of 21.6 per cent from the 821 sold in June last year.</p>
    <p>Not all buy­ers are af­fected by the re­ces­sion. Work­ers in tech­nol­ogy and the civil ser­vice – sec­tors that have not yet felt the pain of the pan­demic-in­duced re­ces­sion – as well as dis­counts and lower in­ter­est rates, un­der­pinned de­mand, said Mr Ni­cholas Mak, ERA Realty’s head of re­search and con­sul­tancy.</p>
    <p>But buy­ers largely re­main price­sen­si­tive.</p>
    <p>“We es­ti­mate 86 per cent of the to­tal de­vel­oper sales in June were (trans­acted) at the me­dian price of $1,000 psf to $2,000 psf, sim­i­lar to May,” said Ms Tri­cia Song, head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore at Col­liers In­ter­na­tional.</p>
    <p>She warned that the sales mo­men­tum may slow down as job losses and eco­nomic re­al­i­ties sink in.</p>
    <p>For the first half of this year, new home sales to­talled 3,911 units, a drop of 6.6 per cent year on year.</p>
    <p>“With home prices highly cor­re­lated to house­hold in­come and job se­cu­rity, we ex­pect pri­vate res­i­den­tial prices could de­cline 5 per cent this year,” Ms Song added.</p>
    <p>Last month, 597 new pri­vate homes were launched for sale, down from 615 units in May and a de­cline of nearly 11 per cent from the 670 sold a year ago.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures re­leased by the Ur­ban</p>
    <p>Rede­vel­op­ment Author­ity yes­ter­day ex­clude ex­ec­u­tive con­do­minium (EC) units, which are a pub­lic-pri­vate hous­ing hy­brid.</p>
    <p>In­clud­ing 33 EC units sold, 1,031 new non-landed homes were taken up last month, about 25 per cent more than a year ago.</p>
    <p>Only one new pro­ject was launched last month: the 18-unit Park­wood Res­i­dences in Yio Chu Kang, which sold one unit at $1,323 psf, or $1.74 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The bulk of last month’s sales came from projects launched ear­lier, driven by de­mand for mass-mar­ket homes in sub­ur­ban ar­eas or out­side the cen­tral re­gion, PropNex said.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong Teck Hui, se­nior di­rec­tor of re­search and con­sul­tancy at JLL, said: “OCR (out­side cen­tral re­gion) posted a 4.2 per cent in­crease over the first quar­ter, while RCR (rest of cen­tral re­gion) and CCR (core cen­tral re­gion) suf­fered de­clines of 10.7 per cent and 60.4 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>“The OCR sub-mar­ket has proven more re­silient, due to more af­ford­ably priced projects and de­mand from HDB up­graders.”</p>
    <p>The re­bound might cause de­vel­op­ers to launch more projects in the sec­ond half of the year, ac­cord­ing to some an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>New launches may in­clude the 633-unit Forett at Bukit Timah, the 566-unit Pen­rose in Sims Drive and the 640-unit Clavon in Cle­menti Av­enue 1.</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ers may of­fer se­lec­tive dis­counts to main­tain sales mo­men­tum, said Mr Leonard Tay, head of re­search at Knight Frank Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>More for­eign buy­ers with deeper pock­ets re­turned to the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket, said Ms Chris­tine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to URA Realis data yes­ter­day, for­eign­ers bought 49 non­landed homes last month, up from 33 units a year ago, while per­ma­nent res­i­dents pur­chased 120 units, up from 86 units a year ago.</p>
    <p>The data also showed that, ex­clud­ing ECs, the num­ber of pri­vate homes trans­acted at $2 mil­lion and above rose to 129 units last month from 23 units in May.</p>
    <p>In the lux­ury seg­ment, 15 Hol­land Hill sold two units for $7.7 mil­lion and $15 mil­lion re­spec­tively, or a me­dian price of $2,914 psf, while Boule­vard 88 sold two units for $6.3 mil­lion and $10.2 mil­lion re­spec­tively, at a me­dian price of $3,621 psf, said Ms Song.</p>
    <p>Ms Sun said: “Many for­eign­ers bought prop­er­ties last month as macroe­co­nomic un­cer­tain­ties drove more over­seas in­vestors to seek shel­ter in safe-haven as­sets here.</p>
    <p>“Al­though show-flats re­opened last month, more for­eign buy­ers are pur­chas­ing pri­vate homes re­motely due to bor­der lock­downs or travel re­stric­tions. This is in stark con­trast to the past, where many for­eign­ers typ­i­cally bought a unit only af­ter vis­it­ing the show-flat.”</p>
