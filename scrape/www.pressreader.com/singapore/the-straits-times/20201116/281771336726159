    <p>WASH­ING­TON • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ap­point­ment of Mr Christo­pher Miller, a for­mer Green Beret and White House counter-ter­ror­ism co­or­di­na­tor, as Act­ing De­fence Sec­re­tary raises “two lay­ers of fear”, the head of the House Armed Ser­vices panel has said.</p>
    <p>The first is the “in­cred­i­bly steep learn­ing curve” on global mil­i­tary op­er­a­tions, op­tions and con­tro­ver­sies that Mr Miller faces after Mr Trump’s dis­missal-by-tweet of Mr Mark Esper as Pen­tagon chief, said Demo­cratic Rep­re­sen­ta­tive Adam Smith of Wash­ing­ton.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond is whether Mr Miller would have the abil­ity and in­cli­na­tion to talk the lame-duck pres­i­dent “off the edge” of an im­promptu de­ci­sion of global con­se­quence, such as de­liv­er­ing on his tweet pledg­ing to with­draw all US troops from Afghanista­n by Christ­mas or his past threats to pull the United States out of Nato.</p>
    <p>“The fear would be the pres­i­dent wakes up one day in the next few months and de­cides that he wants to do some­thing like that, and a brand new sec­re­tary of de­fence doesn’t know how to stop him,” Mr Smith said.</p>
    <p>His sce­nar­ios re­flect con­fu­sion in Wash­ing­ton over the mo­ti­va­tion for Mr Trump’s abrupt post­elec­tion el­e­va­tion of Mr Miller and in­stal­la­tion to key posts of sev­eral other Trump loy­al­ists with lim­ited</p>
    <p>ex­pe­ri­ence in the De­fence De­part­ment’s in­ner work­ings.</p>
    <p>“It should be of con­cern to any­body, be­cause there shouldn’t be a politi­ci­sa­tion of the mil­i­tary,” said Ms Jen Psaki, a spokesman for Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>With­out set­ting out de­tails of new dead­lines to bring US troops home from abroad, Mr Miller said in a memo last Friday to all De­fence De­part­ment em­ploy­ees that “end­ing wars re­quires com­pro­mise and part­ner­ship”.</p>
    <p>“We met the chal­lenge; we gave it our all,” he said in the memo. “Now, it’s time to come home.”</p>
    <p>The Wash­ing­ton Post re­ported that Mr Esper had sent a clas­si­fied memo to the White House this month ex­press­ing con­cerns about ad­di­tional troop cuts.</p>
    <p>The de­bate among de­fence an­a­lysts is whether Mr Trump, re­puted to have fired Mr Esper for be­ing in­suf­fi­ciently loyal, was sim­ply opt­ing for his op­po­site by in­stalling en­thu­si­as­tic boost­ers – or if they were put in place to de­liver tan­gi­ble pol­icy changes in the clos­ing weeks of his ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>There is “worry that these are con­sid­ered deep loy­al­ists to Trump and so may have an agenda be­yond the scope of the job”, said Amer­i­can En­ter­prise In­sti­tute de­fence an­a­lyst Macken­zie Ea­glen.</p>
    <p>The new ap­pointees in­clude Mr Ezra Co­hen-Wat­nick, a friend of Mr Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kush­ner, as Act­ing Un­der­sec­re­tary of De­fence for In­tel­li­gence and Se­cu­rity, and Mr An­thony Tata to the role of Un­der­sec­re­tary for Pol­icy.</p>
    <p>Mr Tata’s pre­vi­ous nom­i­na­tion to that role failed amid crit­i­cism over his past re­marks, in­clud­ing in­sult­ing com­ments about Is­lam.</p>
    <p>While law­mak­ers and an­a­lysts strug­gle to divine Mr Miller’s mis­sion, the tur­moil makes the US vul­ner­a­ble to ad­ver­saries, said mil­i­tary and in­ter­na­tional re­la­tions his­to­rian An­drew Bace­vich.</p>
    <p>“If our ad­ver­saries are plot­ting against us, then the dis­ar­ray that Trump has caused in the na­tional se­cu­rity ap­pa­ra­tus sim­ply in­creases our vul­ner­a­bil­ity,” he said.</p>
    <p>“It presents an op­por­tu­nity (for) our ad­ver­saries... What’s re­ally go­ing on here is that the pres­i­dent has ceased to gov­ern.” If Mr Trump were to is­sue an or­der to speed up with­drawal from Afghanista­n, he said, the com­man­ders “would not dis­obey... but they would kind of slow-walk their ex­e­cu­tion of the or­der”.</p>
    <p>“They can run the clock out,” he said.</p>
