    <p>Thou­sands of jobs are up for grabs in Sin­ga­pore’s boom­ing start-up ecosys­tem, as firms seek out new growth op­por­tu­ni­ties in the chang­ing eco­nomic land­scape amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. The Straits Times looks at promis­ing Sin­ga­pore start-ups in the third part of a four-part se­ries.</p>
    <p>Health-tech start-up Sen­zeHub de­vel­ops wear­ables that mon­i­tor pa­tients’ vi­tal signs such as heart rate and tem­per­a­ture. These de­vices help to flag any de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in the user’s con­di­tion and pro­vide an early alert for emer­gen­cies.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore-head­quar­tered firm was set up last year af­ter re­spond­ing to an in­no­va­tion chal­lenge by In­tel­lec­tual Prop­erty In­ter­me­di­ary, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion es­tab­lished by the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Its de­vice, called the Senze wear­able, is cur­rently be­ing tri­alled at five nurs­ing homes and a gov­ern­ment agency, which can­not be named due to pri­vacy agree­ments.</p>
    <p>The start-up has set up the sys­tem and pro­vided a lap­top, as well as five wear­able de­vices, to each nurs­ing home to get the pilot go­ing. The health in­di­ca­tors are sent to a spec­i­fied care­giver pro­file, such as the nurs­ing sta­tion in a ward, where they can be tracked and mon­i­tored.</p>
    <p>Emer­gency alerts are sent when in­di­ca­tors are trig­gered or falls oc­cur.</p>
    <p>The firm’s founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive Ge­orge Heng, 55, said: “Some of (the nurs­ing homes) have ac­tu­ally asked for more de­vices, but we have a lim­ited bud­get.”</p>
    <p>The de­vices are use­ful for nurs­ing homes as they help to mit­i­gate the short­age of nurs­ing man­power that the homes are fac­ing in the cur­rent coro­n­avirus pan­demic. With these de­vices, less face-to-face in­ter­ac­tion is re­quired too.</p>
    <p>“Of course, there’s a need for nurs­ing care to check on pa­tients phys­i­cally once in a while, but it sup­ple­ments what the nurses are do­ing,” said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>The wear­ables took the team of six about 18 months to de­velop, he said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier ver­sions of the de­vices were de­vel­oped in Sin­ga­pore, but the cur­rent it­er­a­tions are be­ing made in China and Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Sen­zeHub has re­ceived close to $200,000 in grants through ac­cel­er­a­tor pro­grammes and com­pe­ti­tions, such as telco Singtel’s Spe­cial Pan­demic Sup­port Award.</p>
    <p>It was also one of the fi­nal­ists in the Singtel Fu­ture Mak­ers pro­gramme this year, and is part of a num­ber of ac­cel­er­a­tor pro­grammes such as 500Star­tups.</p>
    <p>The start-up has nine em­ploy­ees, and also around five ad­vis­ers from sci­ence, en­gi­neer­ing and med­i­cal back­grounds.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who has worked for global fi­nance and tech firms such as Visa and Or­a­cle, said that given the start-up’s fo­cus on hard­ware prod­ucts, fund­ing is a chal­lenge as not many ven­ture cap­i­tal (VC) firms in the re­gion are in­ter­ested in such cap­i­tal-in­ten­sive ar­eas.</p>
    <p>The firm’s chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer An­drew Schill added that most VCs tend to fo­cus on apps and soft­ware, but the start-up has ben­e­fited from the coro­n­avirus cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“Even though Covid-19 has been dis­as­trous around the world, I think the one sil­ver lin­ing has been this re­newed in­ter­est in health tech so­lu­tions like ours,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng said that with enough peo­ple us­ing its wear­ables in the long term, there are op­por­tu­ni­ties to be ex­plored with the data col­lected for pre­dict­ing ill­nesses in a user. He cited how Stan­ford Medicine re­searchers, along with fit­ness tracker com­pany Fit­bit and med­i­cal re­search fa­cil­ity Scripps Re­search, has been us­ing data from wear­able de­vices to pre­dict if a user is at risk of get­ting in­fec­tions such as Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“Some of the data col­lected in Sin­ga­pore is rather unique as we have dif­fer­ent races. Straight off the bat, you have ge­netic changes, chronic diseases, dif­fer­ent age groups.</p>
    <p>“The data would be very use­ful (in re­search) for com­pa­nies like phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms, or even the gov­ern­ment. So that’s the longer term plan if we get there,” said Mr Heng.</p>
