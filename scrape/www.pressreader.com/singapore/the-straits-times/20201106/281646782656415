    <p>•</p>
    <p>NEW YORK As the re­sults rolled in on Tues­day night, so did a strong sense of deja vu. Pre-elec­tion polls, it ap­peared, had been mis­lead­ing once again.</p>
    <p>While the coun­try awaits fi­nal re­sults from sev­eral key bat­tle­ground states, it is al­ready clear – no mat­ter who ends up win­ning – that the in­dus­try failed to fully ac­count for the mis­steps that led it to un­der­es­ti­mate Mr Don­ald Trump’s sup­port four years ago.</p>
    <p>And it raises the ques­tion of whether the polling in­dus­try can sur­vive yet an­other cri­sis of con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>“I want to see all the re­sults in, I want to see where those de­vi­a­tions are from pre-elec­tion polls and fi­nal mar­gins,” Mr Christophe­r Borick, di­rec­tor of polling at Muh­len­berg Col­lege in Penn­syl­va­nia, said in an in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“But there is am­ple ev­i­dence that there were ma­jor is­sues again. Just how deep they are, we will see.”</p>
    <p>In some states where polls had pro­jected Mr Trump los­ing nar­rowly – like Ohio, Iowa and Florida – he had al­ready been de­clared the win­ner by a com­fort­able mar­gin by late Tues­day evening. And in states that had seemed more than likely to go for Mr Joe Bi­den, like Michi­gan and Ne­vada, the re­sult had been too close to call.</p>
    <p>To some de­gree, it was clear this process would be un­wieldy. With large num­bers of mail-in bal­lots and early in-per­son votes still un­counted, the ear­li­est re­turns in most states gave an in­flated sense of Mr Trump’s strength be­cause vot­ers in Repub­li­can ar­eas turned out in higher num­bers on elec­tion day – and those bal­lots were of­ten the first to be tab­u­lated.</p>
    <p>It was also pos­si­ble, said Mr Pa­trick Mur­ray, polling di­rec­tor at Mon­mouth Univer­sity, that Repub­li­cans’ ef­forts to pre­vent cer­tain pop­u­la­tions from voting eas­ily had a size­able im­pact – a fac­tor that poll­sters knew would be im­mea­sur­able in their sur­veys.</p>
    <p>“We need to know how many votes were re­jected,” he said. “I won’t know un­til some­body ac­tu­ally gives me some data... And it is pos­si­ble that we will never know.”</p>
    <p>He added: “We will never know how many bal­lots were not de­liv­ered by the post of­fice.”</p>
    <p>But what is now clear based on the bal­lots that have been counted – and in al­most all states, a ma­jor­ity have been – is that there was an over­es­ti­ma­tion of Mr Bi­den’s sup­port across the board – par­tic­u­larly with white vot­ers and with men, pre­lim­i­nary exit polls in­di­cated.</p>
    <p>While polling had pre­saged a swing away from Mr Trump among white vot­ers age 65 and over, that never fully took shape.</p>
    <p>Partly as a re­sult, Mr Bi­den un­der­per­formed not only in poly­glot states like Florida, but also in heav­ily white, sub­ur­ban ar­eas like Ma­comb County, Michi­gan, where he had been ex­pected to do well.</p>
    <p>Mr Borick pointed out that while state-level polls had widely mis­fired in 2016, they held steady in the 2018 midterms. This led him to con­clude that peo­ple’s views on Mr Trump may be par­tic­u­larly dif­fi­cult to mea­sure. “In the end, like so many Trump-re­lated things, there may be dif­fer­ent rules when polling an elec­tion with him on the bal­lot,” Mr Borick said.</p>
    <p>“I am a quan­tifi­able type of hu­man be­ing; I want to see ev­i­dence. And I only have two elec­tions with Don­ald Trump in them – but both seem to be be­hav­ing in ways that oth­ers don’t be­have.”</p>
