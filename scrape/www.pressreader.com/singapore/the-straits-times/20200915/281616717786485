    <p>Krem­lin-backed can­di­dates swept most ma­jor con­tests in Rus­sian re­gional elec­tions over the weekend but op­po­si­tion leader Alexei Navalny’s sup­port­ers claimed wins in two Siberian cities – Novosibirs­k and Tomsk, where he was poi­soned last month. Ob­servers said the op­po­si­tion’s per­for­mance proved a de­sire for po­lit­i­cal change in the cities.</p>
    <p>MOSCOW Krem­lin-backed can­di­dates swept most ma­jor con­tests in Rus­sian re­gional elec­tions over the weekend but op­po­si­tion leader Alexey Navalny’s sup­port­ers claimed wins in two Siberian cities, in­clud­ing the one where he was poi­soned last month.</p>
    <p>“The au­thor­i­ties have shown they con­trol the sit­u­a­tion in the coun­try,” said deputy di­rec­tor Alexei Makarkin of the Cen­tre for Po­lit­i­cal Tech­nolo­gies in Moscow. “But the op­po­si­tion’s per­for­mance proves there’s a de­sire for po­lit­i­cal change in ma­jor cities.”</p>
    <p>Rus­sians voted for rep­re­sen­ta­tives at dif­fer­ent lev­els of gov­ern­ment in 83 re­gions, in­clud­ing 18 gov­er­nors over three days end­ing Sun­day, in a key test of sup­port for Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin ahead of next year’s par­lia­men­tary elec­tions.</p>
    <p>The polls came amid un­prece­dented anti-gov­ern­ment protests in neigh­bour­ing Belarus and daily protests in Rus­sia’s eastern Khabarovsk re­gion over the July ar­rest of a pop­u­lar gov­er­nor from out­side the rul­ing party.</p>
    <p>Even as his pop­u­lar­ity hit a record low ear­lier this year amid the eco­nomic dis­lo­ca­tion of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Mr Putin, 67, pushed through con­sti­tu­tional changes in July that al­low him to ex­tend his two-decade rule to as long as 2036. His poll rat­ings picked up last month as the coro­n­avirus epi­demic eased in Rus­sia.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny was cam­paign­ing for can­di­dates against the rul­ing United Rus­sia party when he fell vic­tim in Siberia last month to what Ger­man doc­tors later iden­ti­fied as poisoning by the mil­i­tary nerve agent Novi­chok. He emerged last week from a coma in a Ber­lin hos­pi­tal, where he had been flown to for treat­ment.</p>
    <p>His al­lies pro­claimed vic­to­ries in city coun­cil races in Tomsk and Novosibirs­k, where he had made videos. United Rus­sia can­di­dates won eight of 27 sin­gle man­dates in the Tomsk race. Top Navalny ally Leonid Volkov said the re­sults de­stroy “the whole myth about ‘2 per cent of lib­er­als’ and that they ‘only have sup­port of hip­sters in­side the Gar­den Ring’” road of Moscow. Else­where, cam­paign­ers backed by ex­iled ty­coon Mikhail Khodor­kovsky won 60 mu­nic­i­pal seats in four re­gions.</p>
    <p>Still, United Rus­sia swept gu­ber­na­to­rial polls where op­po­nents were chal­leng­ing the in­cum­bents. In Krasnodar, Gov­er­nor Ve­ni­amin Kon­dratyev won with 85 per cent of the vote ver­sus around 7 per cent for his com­mu­nist chal­lenger. In Irkutsk, Siberia, Mr Igor Kobzev de­feated a com­mu­nist for­mer in­tel­li­gence of­fi­cer, win­ning 60 per cent of the vote.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny, 44, has built a fol­low­ing of mil­lions with online videos ex­pos­ing high-level cor­rup­tion in Rus­sia. Moscow has so far failed to in­ves­ti­gate the poisoning of the cam­paigner, as­sert­ing that it has no ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>How­ever, France’s in­de­pen­dent anal­y­sis has con­cluded that Mr Navalny was poi­soned by Novi­chok in an at­tempted as­sas­si­na­tion, the of­fice of Pres­i­dent Em­manuel Macron said in a state­ment yes­ter­day. Ger­many said ear­lier that lab­o­ra­to­ries in Swe­den and France had in­de­pen­dently cor­rob­o­rated Ger­man re­sults from ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>Mr Navalny had ap­pealed to vot­ers to adopt his “smart vot­ing” ini­tia­tive to sup­port the politi­cian in each area with the best chance of de­feat­ing the United Rus­sia can­di­date. The rul­ing party lost a third of its seats when the tac­tic was pro­moted in last year’s Moscow city coun­cil elec­tions.</p>
    <p>The vote was con­ducted cleanly with only “min­i­mal” ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties, Tass news ser­vice quoted Cen­tral Elec­tion Com­mis­sion chair Ella Pam­filova as say­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
