    <p>OCBC Bank and United Over­seas Bank (UOB) are es­ti­mated at be­tween 1.55 per cent and 1.64 per cent for the quar­ter, ac­cord­ing to Refini­tiv data.</p>
    <p>Be­sides the im­pact of the global pan­demic on tourism and re­tail busi­nesses weigh­ing on re­sults, banks’ earn­ings could also be hurt by larger-than-ex­pected non-per­form­ing loans in the sec­ond quar­ter from generic sec­tors or as com­bined with com­modi­ties-re­lated ex­po­sure.</p>
    <p>This is fur­ther com­pounded by un­em­ploy­ment aris­ing from a deep re­ces­sion that could pose risks to mort­gages and un­se­cured con­sumer loans, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-quar­ter profit at DBS, which re­ports its re­sults to­mor­row, is set to rise nearly 3 per cent to $1.19 bil­lion from a quar­ter ago but slump about 25 per cent on the year, ac­cord­ing to the av­er­age es­ti­mate of five an­a­lysts, Refini­tiv data shows.</p>
    <p>Net profit for OCBC, which re­ports on Fri­day, is set to ad­vance 40 per cent from a quar­ter ago, helped by higher trad­ing in­come and gains from its in­sur­ance unit. On the year, an­a­lysts ex­pect profit to fall 20 per cent.</p>
    <p>Refini­tiv data also shows UOB’s quar­terly profit is es­ti­mated to fall on the quar­ter and from a year ear­lier. UOB will re­lease its re­sults to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish len­ders have of­fered a taste of how much the worst re­ces­sion in cen­turies is go­ing to cost. The bill’s al­ready at £17.2 bil­lion (S$31 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Write-offs at Bri­tain’s six big­gest banks so far this year roughly equal Bar­clays’ cur­rent mar­ket value.</p>
    <p>“There’s likely more of that to come, and with low in­ter­est rates drag­ging on rev­enues, full-year prof­its will not be pretty,” said Mr Ni­cholas Hyett, an an­a­lyst at Har­g­reaves Lans­down.</p>
    <p>The pro­vi­sions are re­quired un­der ac­count­ing rules, but also re­flect con­cerns about how Bri­tish house­holds are go­ing to cope with what the Bank of Eng­land has said could be the worst down­turn in 300 years.</p>
    <p>For some bor­row­ers, “ser­vic­ing will be­come more dif­fi­cult”, said Ms Katie Mur­ray, chief fi­nan­cial of­fi­cer at NatWest Group, which booked £2.1 bil­lion in charges in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Lloyds Bank­ing Group’s profit for the pe­riod was wiped out by a £2.4 bil­lion pro­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Lloyds ex­pects to set aside be­tween £4.5 bil­lion and £5.5 bil­lion this year, hint­ing that the largest pro­vi­sions have al­ready been taken.</p>
    <p>Four months ago, HSBC Hold­ings put the top es­ti­mate on pro­vi­sions this year at US$11 bil­lion (S$15 bil­lion). This week, Europe’s largest bank said the cost could now reach US$13 bil­lion as the global econ­omy de­te­ri­o­rates.</p>
    <p>The largest sin­gle source of the in­crease was Bri­tain, which ac­counted for US$1.45 bil­lion of the US$3.8 bil­lion of the group’s sec­ond-quar­ter charge.</p>
    <p>“Cost-cut­ting is likely in Europe and the US and we would not rule out a break-up op­tion be­ing con­sid­ered,” said Mr Gary Green­wood, an an­a­lyst at Shore Cap­i­tal, as he weighed up the op­tions for HSBC in the face of mount­ing pan­demic costs.</p>
    <p>Bar­clays took a £1.6 bil­lion charge, more than an­a­lysts an­tic­i­pated. The bank, whose bleak out­look was coun­ter­bal­anced by a surge in trad­ing gains, said im­pair­ments in the sec­ond half would be­gin to fall.</p>
    <p>These pre­dic­tions on fu­ture pro­vi­sions de­pend on how the econ­omy fares as Bri­tish lead­ers try to re­open the coun­try while avoid­ing a feared win­ter spike in Covid-19 cases. HSBC said that in its worst-case sce­nario, Bri­tain’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct could fall 9.6 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>It as­signed a 10 per cent prob­a­bil­ity weight­ing to its view – the high­est chance it has given any coun­try for such a dire per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Deutsche Bank an­a­lysts have es­ti­mated that if Bri­tish un­em­ploy­ment reaches 7 per cent, Bri­tish banks might book as much as £40 bil­lion in pro­vi­sions over two years.</p>
    <p>One of the gloomi­est re­ac­tions to Bri­tain’s prospects came from Spain. Banco San­tander wrote down the value of its Bri­tish sub­sidiary by €6.1 bil­lion (S$9.9 bil­lion), wip­ing out al­most all of the value pre­vi­ously as­cribed to the busi­ness and ac­count­ing for more than a third of the pro­vi­sions taken by the Span­ish lender in the last quar­ter.</p>

DBS Bank and United Over&#xAD;seas Bank will re&#xAD;port their quar&#xAD;terly fig&#xAD;ures to&#xAD;mor&#xAD;row, while OCBC Bank re&#xAD;ports its data on Fri&#xAD;day.</p>
