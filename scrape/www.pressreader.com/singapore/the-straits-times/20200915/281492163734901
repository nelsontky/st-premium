    <p>TOKYO • Ja­pan’s Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary Yoshi­hide Suga, a faith­ful loy­al­ist of Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, yes­ter­day won a rul­ing party elec­tion to suc­ceed him as leader of the world’s third-largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, 71, is a rare Ja­panese leader with no po­lit­i­cal blood nor fac­tional af­fil­i­a­tion. The son of straw­berry farm­ers from north­east­ern Akita pre­fec­ture, he is a self-made politi­cian who reached the pin­na­cle of Ja­panese politics by pulling him­self up by his own boot­straps.</p>
    <p>He won com­fort­ably in the Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) race, and pledged to con­tinue Mr Abe’s eco­nomic and for­eign poli­cies.</p>
    <p>How­ever, he also pre­sented him­self as a re­formist who will tackle in­ef­fi­cien­cies in the bu­reau­cracy, and promised to set up new in­sti­tu­tions such as a dig­i­tal agency, given how Covid-19 has ex­posed how woe­ful Ja­pan is on the dig­i­tal front.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe yes­ter­day praised Mr Suga’s cre­den­tials, say­ing that he had “sweated and toiled silently” for Ja­pan and was “in­dis­putably” the best per­son to take the coun­try for­ward.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga will be in­au­gu­rated as prime min­is­ter to­mor­row, when the Diet con­venes for a three-day ex­tra­or­di­nary ses­sion.</p>
    <p>He will se­lect the top LDP lead­er­ship to­day, and name his Cab­i­net team to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>All eyes will be on his Cab­i­net ap­point­ments, given that Mr Suga has vowed to name his team on merit, in­stead of the tra­di­tional horse-trad­ing where back­ing from a fac­tion is given in ex­change for min­is­te­rial po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga quickly won the sup­port of five out of seven LDP fac­tions in the party lead­er­ship con­test, win­ning 377 of the 534 votes cast. This placed him far ahead of for­mer for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida with 89 votes, and for­mer de­fence chief Shigeru Ishiba, with 68 votes.</p>
    <p>The LDP pres­i­dency has a term of three years, but Mr Suga will serve out only the rest of Mr Abe’s ten­ure, which is due to ex­pire next Septem­ber. An­other party elec­tion will be held then.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga has re­jected talk that he will be an “in­terim” leader, and will likely run again next year. The re­sound­ing vic­tory has fu­elled talk that a snap elec­tion might hap­pen as soon as next month for Mr Suga to ce­ment his lead­er­ship with a pub­lic man­date.</p>
    <p>The Ja­panese busi­ness com­mu­nity has cheered the result. Sun­tory Hold­ings chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Tak Ni­inami said that he an­tic­i­pated a smooth takeover and pro­gres­sion of Abe-era poli­cies, but also urged the new gov­ern­ment to ad­vance dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and raise pro­duc­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s new prime min­is­ter will be Mr Yoshi­hide Suga, a trusty lieu­tenant and close con­fi­dant of out­go­ing leader Shinzo Abe who ap­pointed him Chief Cab­i­net Sec­re­tary when he took of­fice in De­cem­ber 2012.</p>
    <p>Their po­lit­i­cal ca­reers have been in­ex­orably linked, with Mr Suga, 71, be­ing the mouth­piece of the gov­ern­ment for its poli­cies and shield­ing Mr Abe when he came un­der pres­sure over scan­dals.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga won com­fort­ably in a rul­ing party elec­tion yes­ter­day and, shortly there­after, pledged to con­tinue Mr Abe’s eco­nomic and for­eign poli­cies. He also pre­sented him­self as a re­formist who will tackle in­ef­fi­cien­cies.</p>
    <p>The change in Na­gat­a­cho, Ja­pan’s po­lit­i­cal cen­tre, will of­fi­cially take place to­mor­row, when the Diet con­venes for a three-day ex­tra­or­di­nary ses­sion.</p>
    <p>This comes after Mr Abe, who turns 66 next Mon­day, sud­denly re­signed last month over a re­lapse of ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis. The stress-in­duced chronic di­ges­tive con­di­tion had al­ready forced a pre­ma­ture end to his lead­er­ship once be­fore, in 2007.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, a rare Ja­panese leader with nei­ther po­lit­i­cal blood nor fac­tion af­fil­i­a­tion, stressed in his vic­tory speech that a po­lit­i­cal vac­uum can­not be al­lowed dur­ing a time of na­tional crisis caused by Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“I want to cre­ate a gov­ern­ment that peo­ple can trust,” he said. “I will push ahead with dereg­u­la­tion and put an end to min­istry sec­tion­al­ism, endemic vested in­ter­ests and the prac­tice of blindly fol­low­ing past prece­dents.”</p>
    <p>He told a news con­fer­ence that he will pri­ori­tise re­form-minded peo­ple as well as sub­ject ex­perts for his Cab­i­net min­is­ters, in­stead of keep­ing closely to the party’s tra­di­tion of horse-trad­ing where Cab­i­net posts are al­lo­cated as a quid pro quo for elec­tion back­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga had quickly won the back­ing of five of the seven Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) fac­tions after he threw his hat into the ring with Mr Abe’s tacit sup­port.</p>
    <p>The win­ner was cho­sen by 394 LDP law­mak­ers, who got one bal­lot each, and the party’s 47 pre­fec­ture chap­ters, which had three del­e­gate votes each.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, who was com­pet­ing in the LDP lead­er­ship race for the first time, was the run­away cham­pion. He won 377 out of the 534 valid bal­lots cast, or 70.6 per cent of the vote, com­pris­ing 288 MP votes and 89 lo­cal del­e­gate votes.</p>
    <p>In sec­ond place was for­mer for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida, 63, like­wise a first-time con­tender, whose 89 votes came from 79 law­mak­ers and 10 lo­cal del­e­gates.</p>
    <p>In last place was for­mer de­fence chief Shigeru Ishiba, 63, who is com­pet­ing in the LDP elec­tion for the fourth time. His 68 votes came from 26 law­mak­ers and 42 lo­cal del­e­gates.</p>
    <p>While the LDP pres­i­dent’s term is for three years, Mr Suga was elected to serve out the re­main­der of Mr Abe’s ten­ure, which is due to ex­pire in Septem­ber next year. An­other party lead­er­ship vote will be called then.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe yes­ter­day said in brief re­marks after the elec­toral out­come was an­nounced that Mr Suga is “in­dis­putably” the best per­son to take Ja­pan for­ward. He said, to rau­cous ap­plause: “For the past seven years and eight months, I have watched Mr Suga silently sweat and toil for the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>Mr Suga is ex­pected to name the lead­er­ship in the LDP to­day and his new Cab­i­net to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>He in­her­its an econ­omy that is in re­ces­sion, bat­tered by Covid-19, and so­cial is­sues like a rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion, as ex­em­pli­fied by the fact that his hometown, Yuzawa city in Akita, is hol­low­ing out. He will also have to steer Ja­pan through geopo­lit­i­cal chal­lenges, amid ten­sions be­tween the United States and China.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin con­grat­u­lated Mr Suga at a daily news brief­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“China is ready to work with the new leader (to) deepen co­op­er­a­tion in the fight against Covid-19, as well as to pro­mote the steady im­prove­ment and de­vel­op­ment of China-Ja­pan re­la­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>TOILING SILENTLY FOR THE COUN­TRY</p>
    <p>For the past seven years and eight months, I have watched Mr Suga silently sweat and toil for the coun­try.</p>
