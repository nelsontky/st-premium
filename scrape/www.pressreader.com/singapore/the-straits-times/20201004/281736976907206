    <p>It has been more than a year since Ms Mon­ica Baey, a for­mer Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) stu­dent, sent a wake-up call to ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tions in the Re­pub­lic to take sex­ual ha­rass­ment se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>All it took was a string of In­sta­gram sto­ries ex­press­ing her dis­ap­point­ment about the lack of vic­tim sup­port, after a male stu­dent filmed her in the shower at Eu­soff Hall in Novem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>Word spread, stu­dents and the pub­lic got all fired up, and NUS took ac­tion by tough­en­ing penalties and tight­en­ing se­cu­rity on cam­pus.</p>
    <p>Other uni­ver­si­ties here fol­lowed suit. But since classes went on­line amid the Covid-19 out­break, stu­dents said en­gage­ment on such is­sues has taken a back­seat. Some also said they have not been on cam­pus as much in the past year.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, many, in­clud­ing a group known as Stu­dents for a Safer NUS (SafeNUS), feel that uni­ver­si­ties should con­tinue to dis­cuss sex­ual mis­con­duct openly, to en­sure last year’s episode is not for­got­ten.</p>
    <p>Court cases in­volv­ing ter­tiary stu­dents com­mit­ting sex­ual of­fences on and off cam­pus have drawn the pub­lic’s at­ten­tion in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>This year alone, nearly 10 for­mer or cur­rent univer­sity stu</p>
    <p>dents ended up in court for of­fences such as tak­ing videos of women show­er­ing and steal­ing fe­male un­der­gar­ments from hos­tel rooms.</p>
    <p>GREATER AWARE­NESS</p>
    <p>NUS tight­ened its dis­ci­plinary frame­work for sex­ual mis­con­duct in June last year to in­clude the sus­pen­sion and ex­pul­sion of of­fend­ing stu­dents.</p>
    <p>It re­in­forced safety and se­cu­rity mea­sures, in­clud­ing im­prov­ing closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion (CCTV) cam­era cov­er­age, up­grad­ing shower cu­bi­cles and toi­let locks to make them more se­cure, and in­creas­ing pa­trols by cam­pus se­cu­rity of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>These were im­ple­mented last year after Ms Baey’s com­plaints. Un­der grad­u­ates said that in the months that fol­lowed the up­roar, there was height­ened aware­ness of sex­ual mis­con­duct among their peers.</p>
    <p>A mod­ule on re­spect and con­sent was con­ducted for all stu­dents. A Vic­tim Care Unit (VCU) was also set up in Au­gust last year. The unit has since con­ducted a stu­dent sur­vey on sex­ual mis­con­duct and cam­pus safety, although the find­ings were not made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>An NUS spokesman said the VCU also kicked off a mini-con­fer­ence se­ries in Au­gust fea­tur­ing ex­pert ad­vice on a range of top­ics, in­clud­ing re­spect and con­sent in the con­text of dat­ing and in­ti­mate en­coun­ters.</p>
    <p>“Through such ses­sions, VCU seeks to pro­mote au­then­tic di­a­logue on top­ics sur­round­ing sex­u­al­ity and cam­pus life,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added that NUS reg­u­larly com­mu­ni­cates with the cam­pus com­mu­nity through e-mail blasts and talks with stu­dent groups. This in­cludes re­mind­ing those stay­ing on cam­pus to look out for one an­other, lock their room doors, and not to al­low non-res­i­dents to en­ter the hos­tels.</p>
    <p>Third-year eco­nom­ics stu­dent Bryan Chang, 23, said: “In the af­ter­math of the (Mon­ica Baey) in­ci­dent, NUS was quite prompt to lis­ten to stu­dents’ con­cerns and in­crease se­cu­rity mea­sures on cam­pus. It did make my friends – mostly guys – more con­scious of such is­sues.”</p>
    <p>RE­IN­FORC­ING CAM­PUS SAFETY</p>
    <p>First-year NUS stu­dent Rishika Ghanamoor­thy, 19, said grilles have been placed around the toi­let cu­bi­cles in her hall. Se­cu­rity pa­trols have also in­creased due to the re­cent spate of cases, she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Lynn Neo, 21, a third-year NUS busi­ness stu­dent, said she re­calls see­ing cam­pus se­cu­rity con­duct­ing pa­trols when she was stay­ing in a hall of res­i­dence last year, but it did not last.</p>
    <p>She then took per­sonal pre­cau­tions such as lock­ing her door while nap­ping, lis­ten­ing out for peo­ple en­ter­ing the toi­let while she was in the shower, and not let­ting any­one un­fa­mil­iar en­ter the res­i­den­tial col­lege with her.</p>
    <p>The col­lege now has a “newer, bet­ter sys­tem” where res­i­dents have to scan their ma­tric­u­la­tion cards in or­der to ac­cess the toi­lets, said Ms Neo, who is no longer re­sid­ing on cam­pus this se­mes­ter.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, they had to key in pass­words to en­ter the toi­lets but the locks were at times faulty, she said.</p>
    <p>Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity (NTU) said it re­vised its policy and pro­ce­dures on ha­rass­ment in Jan­uary last year. “All re­ports of ha­rass­ment are in­ves­ti­gated thor­oughly,” said a spokesman.</p>
    <p>Since the 2019 aca­demic year, all stu­dents have also been re­quired to take an on­line mod­ule on anti-ha­rass­ment. About 24,000 un­der­grad­u­ates have taken the mod­ule, which ex­plains ha­rass­ment and how to seek help.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, se­cu­rity per­son­nel are sta­tioned at halls of res­i­dence from 9pm to 9am, pa­trols have been stepped up, and CCTV cam­eras cover most of the com­mon ar­eas in the halls.</p>
    <p>But a first-year lin­guis­tics stu­dent from NTU who wanted to be known only as Ms Chee, 20, said she has not no­ticed ad­di­tional se­cu­rity mea­sures. She has tried to avoid leav­ing her hall room late at night and said she car­ries her phone to the toi­let in case any­thing hap­pens.</p>
    <p>Ms Chee said that con­ver­sa­tions be­tween stu­dents and the univer­sity ad­min­is­tra­tion to en­able feed­back to be pro­vided on mea­sures taken would be help­ful.</p>
    <p>PEER SUP­PORT</p>
    <p>Mean­while, SafeNUS has been busy re­cruit­ing mem­bers in the past year. Those in the group aim to give their peers a plat­form to dis­cuss sex­ual as­sault and find sup­port.</p>
    <p>The ground-up group was formed in Oc­to­ber last year by four NUS stu­dents – Ms Carissa Cheow, 25, Mr Luke Levy, 22, Ms Lune Loh, 23, and Ms Rayna Kway, 21. It now has 42 com­mit­tee mem­bers and a pool of ad hoc vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>Sup­port and out­reach are some of its key pri­or­i­ties and its plans in­clude a text mes­sag­ing ser­vice for stu­dents to seek sup­port and a sur­vivor sup­port group. It is also study­ing prac­tices in uni­ver­si­ties abroad and work­ing with the NUS Law Pro Bono Group on le­gal re­sources.</p>
    <p>“We wanted to en­gage fac­ul­ties face to face, but with Covid-19, we are now build­ing up an on­line pres­ence,” said Ms Cheow, who is in her fourth year of a con­cur­rent de­gree pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Chang: “Most of my peers feel like the (Mon­ica Baey) in­ci­dent is quite far back. They re­call it, but it’s not in the lime­light any more.”</p>
    <p>But sex­ual mis­con­duct is still perti­nent, and NUS could be more open about how it de­cides on the out­come of stu­dents in court cases, he said.</p>
    <p>“Even if they can’t com­ment pub­licly, after the court pro­ceed­ings are over, uni­ver­si­ties could use these cases to high­light learning points and warn stu­dents in­ter­nally about penalties,” he added.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Cheow: “It is heart­en­ing to see that peo­ple care about this is­sue and want to en­gage. We can­not wait for an­other in­ci­dent to hap­pen. The im­por­tant thing is keep­ing this is­sue on the agenda.”</p>
