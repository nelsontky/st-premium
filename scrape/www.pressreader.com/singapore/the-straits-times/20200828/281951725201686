    <p>In­dia is qui­etly tight­en­ing reg­u­la­tions against Chi­nese firms in the telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions sec­tor as bor­der trou­bles sim­mer, with China’s Huawei Tech­nolo­gies and ZTE Corp re­port­edly be­ing barred from up­com­ing 5G tri­als.</p>
    <p>But in­dus­try in­sid­ers and tele­com ex­perts said that de­cou­pling from the Chi­nese firms is not go­ing to be easy or cost ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>A deadly clash in Gal­wan Val­ley in Ladakh in June saw 20 In­dian and an un­known num­ber of Chi­nese sol­diers killed.</p>
    <p>While In­dia and China have suc­cess­fully delinked bor­der trou­bles from their economic re­la­tion­ship for the past 30 years, the tide has now turned.</p>
    <p>Last month, the In­dian gov­ern­ment tight­ened rules for com­pa­nies from neigh­bour­ing coun­tries seek­ing to bid for gov­ern­ment projects – es­sen­tially tar­get­ing Chi­nese firms.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, pub­lic tel­cos have been asked to re­frain from sourc­ing 4G or other equip­ment from Chi­nese firms. Just last year, the gov­ern­ment had said all firms would be in­vited for 5G tri­als.</p>
    <p>Firms like Bharti Air­tel had named Huawei and ZTE, among oth­ers, as 5G trial part­ners.</p>
    <p>Still, block­ing Chi­nese firms is eas­ier said than done, noted a se­nior ex­ec­u­tive work­ing for a Chi­nese broad­band equip­ment and net­work sys­tems provider.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing is up in the air and out of gear. There is so much pol­icy un­cer­tainty, we don’t know what is go­ing to hap­pen. It is eas­ier said than done to stop tak­ing from China, which is al­ready em­bed­ded in the cur­rent in­fra­struc­ture,” he said, adding that his firm was re­assess­ing its pres­ence in In­dia.</p>
    <p>“We are car­ry­ing on with our work, but then if we know there is noth­ing in the fu­ture for us, we may not want to stay on and may have to re­size to man­age old con­tracts.”</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese firms, which num­ber more than 100, are al­ready fac­ing dif­fi­cul­ties from get­ting ship­ments from China amid in­creased scru­tiny and pol­icy un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>“The mar­ket share of Chi­nese firms is more than one third. That’s</p>
    <p>There is so much pol­icy un­cer­tainty, we don’t know what is go­ing to hap­pen... We are car­ry­ing on with our work, but then if we know there is noth­ing in the fu­ture for us, we may not want to stay on and may have to re­size to man­age old con­tracts.</p>
    <p>UN­CER­TAIN TIMES</p>
    <p>In­dia is an im­por­tant mar­ket for Huawei and we have a long-term com­mit­ment (to In­dia). We are con­fi­dent of our fu­ture in In­dia based on our com­mit­ment and ca­pa­bil­ity to bring value to In­dia. not a small num­ber,” noted Mr Ma­hesh Up­pal, direc­tor of ComFirst, a con­sul­tant com­pany spe­cial­is­ing in reg­u­la­tion and pol­icy.</p>
    <p>This presents In­dian tel­cos with two sets of prob­lems, he said: hav­ing to choose the next best con­tender, and deal­ing with wor­ries about their ex­ist­ing in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>He noted that com­pa­nies had cho­sen Chi­nese firms due to “func­tion­al­ity and cost com­pet­i­tive­ness”.</p>
    <p>“Most tele­com com­pa­nies pro­vide equip­ment, which is sort of a com­plete so­lu­tion. Any kind of mix and match will not be im­pos­si­ble but will come at a cost in terms of money and maybe some de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in qual­ity of per­for­mance.”</p>
    <p>Still, Huawei, when asked for a comment on 5G tri­als and its plans for In­dia, re­mained bullish.</p>
    <p>“In­dia is an im­por­tant mar­ket for Huawei and we have a long-term com­mit­ment” to In­dia, the firm said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“We are con­fi­dent of our fu­ture in In­dia based on our com­mit­ment and ca­pa­bil­ity to bring value to In­dia. We will con­tinue to work closely with all stake­hold­ers in­clud­ing the gov­ern­ment, cus­tomers and in­dus­try part­ners.”</p>
    <p>The tele­com in­dus­try, con­sist­ing of fewer than half a dozen op­er­a­tors, has over the past two decades trans­formed the lives of mil­lions of In­di­ans to the point where even the poor can af­ford a phone and a con­nec­tion. Many com­pa­nies, how­ever, rid­den by debt and tough com­pe­ti­tion, have also folded.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts said knock­ing Chi­nese firms out of the com­pe­ti­tion would add to ex­ist­ing fi­nan­cial stress.</p>
    <p>“Stick­ing to purely tech­ni­cal and com­mer­cial is­sues, one can see that at a time when the com­pa­nies are al­ready strug­gling and they need max­i­mum flex­i­bil­ity, their choices will in fact be re­duced,” said Mr Up­pal.</p>
    <p>Still, at least one In­dian com­pany, Re­liance’s Jio Plat­forms, has an­nounced that it is de­vel­op­ing its own 5G net­work. It has not an­nounced a dead­line, and an­a­lysts said it re­mains to be seen how the tech­nol­ogy shapes up.</p>
    <p>Western firms like Nokia and Eric­s­son and South Korean firm Sam­sung now stand to ben­e­fit from the po­lit­i­cal fall­out.</p>
    <p>Mr Sandip Sab­har­wal, an in­vest­ment ad­viser, said: “Se­cu­rity con­cerns (re­gard­ing Chi­nese firms), both in terms of equip­ment and soft­ware and their apps, are world­wide. This scru­tiny (in In­dia) is go­ing to re­main in the fore­see­able fu­ture, ir­re­spec­tive of the res­o­lu­tion of the bor­der prob­lem. They will al­ways be looked at sus­pi­ciously for one or two years.”</p>
