    <p>Over time, there may have been a shift in of­fi­cial think­ing about the ex­tent of state in­ter­ven­tion needed to re­duce so­cial in­equal­ity.</p>
    <p>But th­ese ef­forts need to be fis­cally sus­tain­able, so that fu­ture gen­er­a­tions are not fi­nan­cially bur­dened even as the coun­try strives to build a re­silient and car­ing so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>This was Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and Fi­nance Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat’s mes­sage yes­ter­day when he out­lined the Min­istry of Fi­nance’s (MOF) plans for the new term of Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>His word of cau­tion, in the Ad­den­dum to the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, is a nec­es­sary re­minder given the un­prece­dented amount of money com­mit­ted this year to en­sure Sin­ga­pore will ride out the coro­n­avirus-in­duced re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>It is nearly $100 bil­lion and, as Mr Heng points out, a sum that can­not be sus­tained in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>Not when the Budget books will be squeezed at both ends: by the ris­ing ex­pen­di­ture to sup­port fam­i­lies and health­care needs, and fall­ing rev­enue from slower global growth and in­ter­na­tional com­pe­ti­tion over tax rev­enues.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, Sin­ga­pore­ans have been fore­warned that the goods and ser­vices tax (GST) will be raised to meet the grow­ing needs from health­care and so­cial spend­ing.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment, mean­while, will bor­row to fi­nance longer-term in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>There is also the is­sue of so­cial eq­uity in rev­enue-rais­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng al­luded in the Ad­den­dum to fu­ture ad­just­ments to in­come, con­sump­tion and as­set-re­lated taxes, adding that those who are more well-off will have to con­trib­ute more.</p>
    <p>“We are com­mit­ted to a fis­cal sys­tem that is fair and pro­gres­sive – with the bet­ter-off con­tribut­ing more, and lower- and mid­dle-in­come house­holds re­ceiv­ing more in ben­e­fits than the taxes they pay,” he said.</p>
    <p>No­body likes to pay more taxes. But it would be un­con­scionable for a priv­i­leged few to live in the lap of lux­ury while the vast ma­jor­ity strug­gle to make ends meet amid the se­vere economic fall­out from the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, com­men­ta­tors are speak­ing of a “K-shaped” recovery – an un­even one that will widen the di­vide be­tween the haves and the have-nots.</p>
    <p>As the af­flu­ent ben­e­fit from ris­ing as­set mar­kets and the recovery in eq­ui­ties, lower-skilled and lower-in­come work­ers are los­ing their jobs dis­pro­por­tion­ately as busi­nesses in the ser­vices and re­tail sec­tors con­tinue to bleed.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng ac­knowl­edged that there has been a shift in of­fi­cial think­ing on gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tions to im­prove so­cial eq­uity.</p>
    <p>He noted that the Gov­ern­ment has pro­gres­sively moved to­wards greater so­cial se­cu­rity over the years, through schemes such as Work­fare and Sil­ver Sup­port for the low-in­come and el­derly, and more sub­si­dies for pre-school ed­u­ca­tion and health­care.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment, he said, will con­tinue to strengthen sup­port for low-wage work­ers, vul­ner­a­ble se­niors and house­holds with greater care­giv­ing bur­dens. It will also sup­port af­ford­able and qual­ity ed­u­ca­tion, health­care, and hous­ing for the broad base of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese in­vest­ments build hu­man and so­cial cap­i­tal,” he added.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s Ad­denda by the MOF as well as the Min­istry of Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY), and sev­eral di­vi­sions in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice, spoke not just to the Budget books, but also the heart.</p>
    <p>The MCCY wants to nur­ture a kinder and more gen­er­ous heart among Sin­ga­pore­ans, and one of the ways it cited is to pro­vide the youth in the com­mu­nity and so­cial sec­tors with op­por­tu­ni­ties for trainee­ship and in­tern­ship.</p>
    <p>But the Gov­ern­ment can­not go it alone in build­ing a re­silient and car­ing so­ci­ety, ac­knowl­edged Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth Ed­win Tong as he called on Sin­ga­pore­ans to ac­tively part­ner the Gov­ern­ment, whether it is on com­mu­nity ini­tia­tives to help the vul­ner­a­ble or dia­logues on the sen­si­tive is­sues of race and re­li­gion.</p>
    <p>He also pledged gov­ern­ment sup­port for the groundswel­l of com­mu­nity-based move­ments for mu­tual sup­port, even af­ter</p>
    <p>Covid-19 is over.</p>
    <p>The mes­sage is clear – col­lec­tive ac­tion is needed at all lev­els of so­ci­ety if Sin­ga­pore is to emerge stronger from the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Whether it can be­come a more in­clu­sive so­ci­ety de­pends not just on gov­ern­ment largesse, but also on strong part­ner­ships be­tween the Gov­ern­ment, busi­nesses and the com­mu­nity.</p>
