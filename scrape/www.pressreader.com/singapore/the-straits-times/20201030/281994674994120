    <p>Demo­crat Joe Bi­den is lead­ing in the race for the White House and his party is favoured to win the Se­nate as well, in an un­der­looked con­test that could have far-reach­ing ram­i­fi­ca­tions for years to come.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump had told Repub­li­can donors at a closed­door meet­ing that it would be “very tough” for his party to hold the Se­nate, where it now has a 53 to 47 ma­jor­ity, the Wash­ing­ton</p>
    <p>Post re­ported this week.</p>
    <p>Even if Mr Trump is re-elected, a Demo­crat-con­trolled Se­nate and House could thwart his leg­isla­tive agenda as well as im­peach him again, al­though re­mov­ing him from of­fice re­quires a far higher thresh­old of 67 sen­a­tors than they will likely be able to muster.</p>
    <p>But should Democrats re­gain the White House, flip the Se­nate and keep the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, they would have uni­fied con­trol of the fed­eral gov­ern­ment for the first time since 2011, em­pow­er­ing them to pass broad re­forms in health­care, crim­i­nal jus­tice and en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Many more op­tions would also be open to the Democrats that could fun­da­men­tally shift the bal­ance be­tween the two par­ties, in­clud­ing ex­pand­ing vot­ing rights and turn­ing the Dis­trict of Columbia and pos­si­bly Puerto Rico into Amer­ica’s 51st and 52nd states.</p>
    <p>This goal is well within reach for the Democrats if Mr Bi­den wins and they gain a min­i­mum of three seats to con­trol the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Thirty-five Se­nate seats are up for grabs and the Repub­li­can Party is de­fend­ing 23 of them. But it is vul­ner­a­ble in 12 races, in­clud­ing seven which the non-par­ti­san Cook Po­lit­i­cal Re­port rates as tossups: two in Ge­or­gia, and one each in Iowa, Maine, Mon­tana, North Carolina and South Carolina.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the Democrats have 12 seats to de­fend and are vul­ner­a­ble in only two: Alabama and Michi­gan. They are also widely seen by poll­sters as likely to re­tain con­trol of the House and even ex­pand their cur­rent ma­jor­ity.</p>
    <p>Vul­ner­a­ble Repub­li­can sen­a­tors have been weighed down by a dip in the Pres­i­dent’s na­tional ap­proval rat­ings, stem­ming largely from his han­dling of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>And they are try­ing to dis­tance them­selves from Mr Trump in their com­ments and elec­tion ad­ver­tise­ments, they added.</p>
    <p>“Repub­li­can in­cum­bents seem not to have been able to es­tab­lish records of their own that would com­mend them to vot­ers, not only to those who sup­port Don­ald Trump but to some who don’t,” said con­ser­va­tive po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Michael Barone at an Amer­i­can En­ter­prise In­sti­tute panel on Oct 20.</p>
    <p>But Se­nate Ma­jor­ity leader Mitch McCon­nell said the nom­i­na­tion of con­ser­va­tive judge Amy Coney Bar­rett to the Supreme Court had boosted the re-elec­tion chances of Repub­li­cans in tight races. “I think it’s a 50-50 propo­si­tion,” he said of keep­ing the Repub­li­can Se­nate ma­jor­ity, in an in­ter­view with The Wash­ing­ton Post on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>DEMOCRATS’ DREAMS</p>
    <p>Pro­gres­sives are al­ready call­ing for broad re­forms – some of which were Bills passed by the Demo­cratic House but not ad­vanced by the Repub­li­can Se­nate this term – should they win the Se­nate.</p>
    <p>Among them are the elec­toral re­forms de­tailed in the For the Peo­ple Act, the first Bill passed by the cur­rent it­er­a­tion of the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives in Jan­uary 2019. They in­clude di­lut­ing the power of big money in pol­i­tics and curb­ing par­ti­san ger­ry­man­der­ing.</p>
    <p>The Bill’s ef­forts to ex­pand vot­ing rights, in­clud­ing mak­ing elec­tion day a fed­eral hol­i­day and cre­at­ing a na­tional au­to­matic voter reg­is­tra­tion pro­gramme, are aimed at boost­ing voter turnout.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic Party, which dom­i­nates the more pop­u­lous coastal states, is also dis­ad­van­taged by the Se­nate’s struc­ture of giv­ing ev­ery state two seats re­gard­less of its pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>So, some Democrats favour grant­ing state­hood to the Dis­trict of Columbia, which has three elec­toral col­lege votes but no rep­re­sen­ta­tion in the Se­nate or the House of Rep­re­sen­ta­tives, even though its pop­u­la­tion of 700,000 is larger</p>
    <p>than Wy­oming’s 580,000 and Ver­mont’s 630,000.</p>
    <p>The Dis­trict leans heav­ily blue, which would in the­ory give Democrats two more votes in the Se­nate and likely one in the House. The Demo­cratic House passed a Bill mak­ing DC the 51st state this sum­mer, but the Repub­li­can Se­nate did not take it up.</p>
    <p>The par­ti­san fight over Jus­tice Bar­rett’s re­cent con­fir­ma­tion has also prompted calls for a Demo­cratic Se­nate to raise the num­ber of Supreme Court jus­tices.</p>
    <p>“Re­mem­ber that Repub­li­cans have lost six of the last seven pop­u­lar votes, but have ap­pointed six of the last nine jus­tices,” pro­gres­sive law­maker Il­han Omar tweeted. “By ex­pand­ing the court we fix this bro­ken sys­tem and have the court bet­ter rep­re­sent the val­ues of the Amer­i­can peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Since 1869, the num­ber of Supreme Court jus­tices has been nine, al­though the num­ber changed six times be­fore that.</p>
    <p>A YouGov poll ear­lier this month found 47 per cent of vot­ers op­pose pack­ing the court to 34 per cent who favour it, and Mr Bi­den has been hes­i­tant to state where he stands, say­ing he would in­stead set up a com­mis­sion to study op­tions to over­haul the court.</p>
    <p>The sweep­ing re­forms will also not have the sup­port of ev­ery­one, with mod­er­ate Democrats, who fear it may hurt their re-elec­tion chances, less likely to be keen on them than pro­gres­sives, said com­men­ta­tors.</p>
