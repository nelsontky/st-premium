    <p>A pro­jec­tile anal­y­sis with the Health Sci­ences Author­ity (HSA) helped the po­lice track down the per­son re­spon­si­ble for fir­ing ball bear­ings near a bridal party which dam­aged two cars.</p>
    <p>The HSA was roped in af­ter a fu­tile search by the po­lice to track down the shooter.</p>
    <p>About two weeks af­ter the in­ci­dent on July 1, 2017, the po­lice had their man – Sa­muel Tan Joo Soon.</p>
    <p>The 53-year-old Sin­ga­porean was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to three weeks’ jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to one count of com­mit­ting a rash act.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Chong Kee En re­lated de­tails of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion and the events that un­folded that day.</p>
    <p>He said mem­bers of a bridal party were play­ing “gate­crash­ing” games at the void deck of Block 762, Wood­lands Av­enue 6 when they heard what sounded like shots be­ing fired.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the gate­crash­ing games, the grooms­men and brides­maids laughed and cheered loudly which gen­er­ated sub­stan­tial noise... At or about 7.15am, some of the brides­maids heard a few very loud ‘bang’ sounds whilst still at the void deck of Block 762 but were un­able to de­ter­mine the source of the noises.”</p>
    <p>About 15 min­utes later, two men from the bridal party no­ticed that a white Subaru Impreza and a sil­ver Mazda were dented, and there were holes on their rear wind­screens.</p>
    <p>The other three cars in their en­tourage were not dam­aged.</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, no one was in­jured in the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>One of them alerted the po­lice and of­fi­cers later found 12 metal ball bear­ings at the scene.</p>
    <p>On July 18, 2017, po­lice searched Tan’s fifth-storey unit at the nearby Block 764A and found two pack­ets of metal ball bear­ings as well as a wooden cat­a­pult with an elas­tic band.</p>
    <p>He had shot the ball bear­ings from his daugh­ter’s bed­room win­dow.</p>
    <p>Tan, who is job­less, told po­lice he was not ir­ri­tated by the bridal party and had not tar­geted them, but was shoot­ing at pi­geons to scare the birds.</p>
    <p>DPP Chong said Tan bought the wooden cat­a­pult in 2008 and used it to shoot stones at birds. But he re­alised cat­a­pults were il­le­gal in Sin­ga­pore when he watched some videos on YouTube.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, he did not throw it away and in­stead, went on­line in 2017 to pur­chase two pack­ets of ball bear­ings for $14.</p>
    <p>Tan had said he spot­ted some pi­geons on a ledge at nearby Block 765 on July 1, 2017, and fired the ball bear­ings at the birds even though he was aware of the bridal party at the ground floor.</p>
    <p>Tan’s bail was set at $5,000 yes­ter­day and he will sur­ren­der him­self on Sept 23 to be­gin serv­ing his sen­tence.</p>
