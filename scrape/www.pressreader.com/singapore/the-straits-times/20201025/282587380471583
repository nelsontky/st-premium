    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have had a long-last­ing love af­fair with Bali, con­sis­tently a top travel des­ti­na­tion due to its close ge­o­graph­i­cal lo­ca­tion and high-end ac­com­mo­da­tion of­fer­ings. But the Covid-19 cli­mate has meant that bor­ders are now closed and tourism on the Is­land of the Gods has ceased, caus­ing mas­sive un­em­ploy­ment. Life con­tin­ues, how­ever, thanks to small acts of kind­ness from a se­lec­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans liv­ing in Bali.</p>
    <p>It is no secret that Sin­ga­pore­ans love food, which makes it the per­fect way to show kind­ness to oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean cook An­drew Ro­drigues, 48, who runs Da­pur Panda, a shack sell­ing hawker fare i n Le­gian, has called Bali home for 10 years.</p>
    <p>Sit­ting at one of Da­pur Panda’s two ta­bles, you get the sense that this bolt­hole does more than serve up Sin­ga­porean clas­sics. Peo­ple pop by for a quick feed of fried bee­hoon or kway teow, but not be­fore check­ing in with Mr Ro­drigues. He is more a trusted un­cle than cook – lis­ten­ing, jok­ing and ad­vis­ing where needed. His sense of com­mu­nity-mind­ed­ness and com­mit­ment to feed­ing l oyal cus­tomers pre­vented him from shut­ting the shop when bor­ders closed.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing the l ock­down part of Covid-19 in Bali, I talked to my staff and told them we were go­ing to lose money, so I asked them what was the low­est salary they could work for to keep us open.</p>
    <p>“I have ex-staff and they come to me and I feed them if they need it. It’s about sur­vival now. I stay open to look af­ter my reg­u­lar cus­tomers, to be able to give them the kind of food they miss from their home in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Darny Man­cano, 47, who has lived in Bali for 21/ years,</p>
    <p>2 runs As­miera Spice Cooking Stu­dio in Umalas. It op­er­ates classes for chil­dren aged five to 12 and sup­plies hand­crafted Amer­i­can pies to cafes and clients. But the pandemic has im­pacted en­rol­ment and bills still need to be paid.</p>
    <p>“It is ob­vi­ous I can’t just give up due to the un­fore­seen ef­fects of the pandemic. Nei­ther can I force any­one to em­power me to teach their chil­dren how to bake and cook de­li­cious food,” she says from her cus­tom-built kitchen in a new shopping de­vel­op­ment in Jalan Raya Bum­bak. “What I do on a daily ba­sis is have faith, be strong and carry on – it’s busi­ness as usual.”</p>
    <p>Ms Darny has also been in­stru­men­tal in found­ing the Women’s Fel­low­ship Group, which meets up reg­u­larly in Bali to sup­port fel­low busi­ness own­ers.</p>
    <p>“This is a di­verse group of women from all across the In­done­sia ar­chi­pel­ago. Th­ese women have busi­nesses in Bali and we share our ideas, ex­pe­ri­ences and ex­per­tise, and talk through our chal­lenges by rec­om­mend­ing holis­tic so­lu­tions.</p>
    <p>“It is a way for us to help one an­other and this is es­pe­cially im­por­tant dur­ing th­ese chal­leng­ing times,” she adds.</p>
    <p>A re­cip­i­ent of this help is Ms Nathasha Priska, 35, cre­ator of dough­nut bak­ery So­bat Donat, who has lived in Den­pasar since 2014.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore Covid-19, I sup­plied my dough­nuts to cafes in Sun­set Road, Umalas and Ker­obokan, but th­ese cafes have closed. Through the sup­port and re­fer­rals of the Women’s Fel­low­ship Group, I have kept my small home busi­ness from clos­ing. Every bit has helped,” she says.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean-owned com­pany and lux­ury beach­front re­sort Como Uma Canggu was one of the first to help its em­ploy­ees.</p>
    <p>Ms Anna Rohm, 41, Como’s ex­ec­u­tive as­sis­tant man­ager, says it has re­mained open through­out this time, when many ho­tels have had to close, some in­def­i­nitely.</p>
    <p>“With the clo­sure of in­ter­na­tional bor­ders, every busi­ness has been af­fected, es­pe­cially in the hos­pi­tal­ity i ndus­try. We were able to re­main open by re­duc­ing our op­er­a­tions and shift­ing our fo­cus to the lo­cal and do­mes­tic mar­kets. De­spite the best ef­forts of the in­dus­try, a great num­ber of em­ploy­ees in Bali have been af­fected by the dra­matic re­duc­tion in busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>The Como se­nior man­age­ment team’s first re­sponse was to pro­vide food re­lief pack­ages in May to help their em­ploy­ees get through tough times. On Oct 16, Como also joined up with the Schol­ars of Sus­te­nance Bali chap­ter for World Food Day to feed those in need. Schol­ars of Sus­te­nance tack­les f ood waste while feed­ing the hun­gry.</p>
    <p>“We are ex­cited to get be­hind this project and par­tic­i­pate and do­nate to this cause. We are mak­ing a nowaste veg­e­tar­ian nasi cam­pur which we will of­fer guests to par­tic­i­pate in and do­nate as well. We can feed up to 20 peo­ple for as lit­tle as $5,” she says. “Even small ac­tions help right now.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean artist Jor­raine Lim, 35, has lived in Bali for five years and runs Ber­awa Art House, which pro­vides weekly art pro­grammes for kids and adults from her stu­dio in Canggu.</p>
    <p>“When I came to live in Bali, I wanted to help the lo­cal kids earn money by cre­at­ing wall art for restau­rants, but soon re­alised that what was needed was a prop­erly run and ded­i­cated art stu­dio for ex­pats. The Ber­awa Art House stu­dio is a place where I teach chil­dren and adults how to cre­ate dig­ni­fied can­vas art they are proud to dis­play at home.”</p>
    <p>As the pandemic wors­ened, she went back to Sin­ga­pore to be with fam­ily, but re­turned to Bali as soon as she could.</p>
    <p>“My fam­ily wants me back in Sin­ga­pore, but I have to hon­our my com­mit­ments here. Many of my stu­dents come to my class for ther­apy al­most – cre­at­ing art­work is ther­a­peu­tic, an in­ward prac­tice. So it can help a lot dur­ing stress­ful times. Plus, th­ese kids get to take home an amaz­ing piece of work to show their par­ents. I love that I can help peo­ple in this small way,” she says.</p>
    <p>Phi­lan­thropist Adrian Keet, 44, has lived in the Ber­awa area for seven years and seen it trans­form from a small vil­lage to the tourist of­fer­ing it is to­day.</p>
    <p>By day, he is a man­age­ment and strat­egy con­sul­tant, but in his spare time, he is busy with com­mu­nity ini­tia­tives like BGreener, a com­mu­nity of busi­ness own­ers and en­trepreneur­s pro­mot­ing an eth­i­cal and con­scious en­vi­ron­ment, and Schol­ars of Sus­te­nance.</p>
    <p>He also sup­ports Merah Pu­tih Hi­jau, which works to solve the waste-man­age­ment prob­lem in Bali’s wa­ter sup­ply, and set up Ber­awa Nip­pers, which teaches chil­dren valu­able surf life-sav­ing skills and does Sun­day morn­ing beach clean-ups.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been do­ing this kind of work for a while now. It started with Merah Pu­tih Hi­jau and, more re­cently, The Bali Pledge, which com­prises lo­cal busi­nesses and global com­mu­ni­ties com­mit­ting to and sup­port­ing sus­tain­able, con­scious tourism in Bali. My back­ground as an en­gi­neer is to solve the root cause and not just the symp­toms.</p>
    <p>“It’s not about get­ting through Covid-19 – we will get through this – but when we do, what is the Bali we want to build, not just for us ex­pats, but also what do the lo­cals want and how can we sup­port them?”</p>
    <p>And he says the feed­back from the lo­cals is that they want a more con­scious, sus­tain­able f orm of tourism, one that is re­spect­ful of lo­cal cul­tures, with en­vi­ron­men­tal aware­ness.</p>
    <p>He adds: “I con­sider Bali my home as long as I’m welcome here. It’s not my right­ful home or birth­place, but I’m com­fort­able here and that’s part of the rea­son I want to give back to the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>“It’s an ex­pres­sion of how you think and feel, but peo­ple can’t see how you think and feel. Peo­ple can see only through your ac­tions, so it’s about cre­at­ing a less self­ish way that is fairer to all, walk­ing your talk, and do­ing some­thing about it.”</p>
    <p>The au­thor is an Aus­tralian free­lance life­style writer and pas­sion­ate ob­server and re­porter of peo­ple do­ing great things. She is cur­rently based in Bali.</p>
