    <p>A na­tional re­view of is­sues in Sin­ga­pore af­fect­ing women was an­nounced last month. Led by three fe­male po­lit­i­cal of­fice-hold­ers, Con­ver­sa­tions on Women’s De­vel­op­ment aims to bring about a mind­set change on val­ues like gen­der equal­ity and re­spect for women.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a crit­i­cal part of it should be a se­ri­ous con­sid­er­a­tion of gen­eral, com­pre­hen­sive leg­is­la­tion of­fer­ing pro­tec­tion against dis­crim­i­na­tion at work.</p>
    <p>What we have in place is very lim­ited and frag­mented leg­is­la­tion, with Sin­ga­pore re­liant mainly on education for en­sur­ing em­ploy­ment equal­ity.</p>
    <p>Take a mar­ried woman em­ployee who is preg­nant and hopes to have a fam­ily. She is af­forded some pro­tec­tion un­der the Em­ploy­ment Act as re­gards dis­missal with­out suf­fi­cient cause dur­ing pregnancy and re­sult­ing loss of her pay while on ma­ter­nity leave. But her le­gal rights, ex­cept where her con­tract pro­vides, do not pro­tect against low­ered pro­mo­tional prospects and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties or re­as­sign­ment to me­nial tasks be­cause of ma­ter­nity. Nor, if she is look­ing for a job, do they pro­tect against dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing. Be­sides, the law is silent on her pro­tec­tion against a host of other ways, other than ma­ter­nity con­cerns, in which women and other vul­ner­a­ble groups face dis­crim­i­na­tion at work.</p>
    <p>Hence, we sug­gest Sin­ga­pore should have a new law – call it the Em­ploy­ment and Oc­cu­pa­tional Equal­ity Act – which will cover all kinds of un­equal treat­ment and var­i­ous cat­e­gories of peo­ple who may face em­ploy­ment and oc­cu­pa­tional dis­crim­i­na­tion. It will put the mus­cle of law be­hind the pro­tec­tion and be clearer and more trans­par­ent and ef­fec­tive than what we have now.</p>
    <p>It should be gen­eral in cov­er­ing pro­tec­tion for the main grounds on which peo­ple may find them­selves vul­ner­a­ble to dis­crim­i­na­tion at work: sex and sex­ual ori­en­ta­tion, race, eth­nic­ity, re­li­gion, age and dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>This as­pect will not de­tract from the main fo­cus of the cur­rent re­view – women’s is­sues – but re­in­force it by ground­ing that con­cern in the fun­da­men­tal prin­ci­ple that should be the bedrock for mak­ing a so­ci­ety to­gether: our equal dig­nity as hu­man per­sons.</p>
    <p>This pro­tec­tion should also be com­pre­hen­sive in two ways. First, it should cover em­ploy­ment and also ex­tend to en­sur­ing equal­ity in oc­cu­pa­tions, in­clud­ing the right to non-dis­crim­i­na­tion in ac­cess to pro­fes­sions and ap­point­ments.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, the pro­tec­tion should not be lim­ited to dis­crim­i­na­tory ter­mi­na­tions, but cover the full range of acts by which one group may be made less equal to oth­ers at work.</p>
    <p>Hence, it should af­ford pro­tec­tion against di­rect and in­di­rect dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing and fir­ing, and dis­crim­i­na­tory treat­ment in as­sess­ments and op­por­tu­ni­ties for ad­vance­ment and train­ing. And the pro­tec­tion should en­sure fair and equal re­mu­ner­a­tion for work, bear­ing in mind that there can be dif­fer­ences based on the prin­ci­ple of equal pay for work of equal value.</p>
    <p>These acts are dis­crim­i­na­tory where dif­fer­en­tial en­gage­ment, ter­mi­na­tion or treat­ment are with­out ob­jec­tive jus­ti­fi­ca­tion based on the proper na­ture and pur­pose of the work.</p>
    <p>A con­cern may be the fear of over-pro­tec­tion and pos­si­bil­ity of de­fen­sive hir­ing. This can be ad­dressed by a gen­eral ex­cep­tion made for bona fide oc­cu­pa­tional re­quire­ments: That is, those con­sid­er­a­tions for dif­fer­ent treat­ment which are held in good faith and are rel­e­vant to the pur­pose of the em­ploy­ment or oc­cu­pa­tion at hand would not be held to be dis­crim­i­na­tory. For ex­am­ple, where vis­ual ex­am­i­na­tion of some­thing is key to the job, then it would not be dis­crim­i­na­tory to rule out can­di­dates with eye­sight de­fi­cien­cies.</p>
    <p>PAR­TIAL LE­GAL PRO­TEC­TION</p>
    <p>The cur­rent pro­tec­tion rests on piece­meal and very lim­ited leg­is­la­tion. The prob­lem is that dis­crim­i­na­tory in­ten­tion ob­structed in one form can take a dif­fer­ent form.</p>
    <p>There is some pro­tec­tion in the Em­ploy­ment Act for preg­nant fe­male em­ploy­ees, against dis­missals dur­ing the pregnancy and on ab­sence on ma­ter­nity leave.</p>
    <p>But such pro­tec­tion is lim­ited to ma­ter­nity-re­lated cases and cov­ers only dis­missals.</p>
    <p>How­ever, there are other forms of dis­crim­i­na­tory prac­tices that women may face, such as those re­gard­ing pro­mo­tion, bonuses and op­por­tu­ni­ties for train­ing.</p>
    <p>An­other nar­rowly con­fined pro­tec­tion that may be con­sid­ered a form of anti-dis­crim­i­na­tion law is af­forded by the Re­tire­ment and Re-em­ploy­ment Act, which makes it an of­fence to dis­miss on the grounds of age any em­ployee who is be­low the min­i­mum re­tire­ment age of 62, and al­lows such em­ploy­ees to make writ­ten rep­re­sen­ta­tions to the Min­is­ter for Man­power for re­in­state­ment.</p>
    <p>An un­in­tended blow­back of this par­tial pro­tec­tion would be that where there is al­ready prej­u­dice, peo­ple ap­proach­ing their late 40s and 50s may find it harder to get em­ployed in the first place by such em­ploy­ers, or to ob­tain ad­vance­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties if al­ready em­ployed.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, un­der Sec­tion 14(2) of the Em­ploy­ment Act, an em­ployee who is “dis­missed with­out just cause or ex­cuse” may lodge a claim with the Em­ploy­ment Claims Tri­bunals for re­in­state­ment or com­pen­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>A dis­crim­i­na­tory ground of dis­missal would ar­guably be such a dis­missal “with­out just cause or ex­cuse”. Again, pro­tec­tion lim­ited to dis­missals on dis­crim­i­na­tory grounds can back­fire – by turn­ing the dis­crim­i­na­tory in­tent or fear to­wards un­equal hir­ing or treat­ment of that cat­e­gory of per­sons.</p>
    <p>EDUCATION AND EN­FORCE­MENT</p>
    <p>The main gen­eral pro­tec­tion re­lies on education. The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM), with em­ploy­ers’ as­so­ci­a­tions and unions, un­der the Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair and Pro­gres­sive Em­ploy­ment Prac­tices (Tafep), has drawn up guide­lines which the MOM sup­ports and tries within its ad­min­is­tra­tive means to en­force.</p>
    <p>There are many such guide­lines. The use of these and MOM’s ef­forts in sup­port­ing and en­forc­ing them rep­re­sent a mas­sive in­ter­ven­tion in how busi­nesses are run in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>So the ques­tion is not whether we should make na­tional ef­forts at promoting and pro­tect­ing em­ploy­ment equal­ity. We are al­ready do­ing a great deal of this that af­fects the way business is car­ried out.</p>
    <p>The ques­tion is whether the present sys­tem would not be bet­ter re­placed or sup­ple­mented by a gen­eral frame­work of laws giv­ing com­pre­hen­sive pro­tec­tion against dis­crim­i­na­tion that would con­sol­i­date the pro­tec­tion of­fered un­der one le­gal frame­work; ra­tio­nalise the pro­tec­tion so that there are not pock­ets and cor­ners of non-pro­tec­tion; and put it on a rule-based, trans­par­ent, and ul­ti­mately ju­di­cially ad­ju­di­cated sys­tem of law.</p>
    <p>The difficulty with promoting eth­i­cal prac­tices mainly with education is that some­times the lat­i­tude avail­able to per­sons or busi­nesses will­ing to be un­eth­i­cal (in this case, un­equal) gives them more room for ma­noeu­vre, and pro­vides them with a com­pet­i­tive advantage.</p>
    <p>This advantage may take the form of less care and scru­ples over hir­ing, fir­ing and man­age­ment, al­low­ing the em­ployer to spend less time, care and ex­pense over the process.</p>
    <p>Or it may be in re­sponse to a seg­ment of the pub­lic’s en­trenched dis­crim­i­na­tory pref­er­ences. Even en­light­ened busi­nesses and those with good­will would be con­cerned about how their clients would re­act to more equal business prac­tices.</p>
    <p>And there would be niche ad­van­tages to busi­nesses that pan­dered to these bi­ases. As a con­se­quence, some­times dis­crim­i­na­tion can be prof­itable. This, of course, does not make the con­sid­er­a­tion a rel­e­vant em­ploy­ment cri­te­rion. It is all the more egre­gious be­cause it re­in­forces and feeds off a pub­lic in­jus­tice.</p>
    <p>The ad­min­is­tra­tive means of en­force­ment which the MOM man­ages to mar­shal has the de­fect of be­ing overly re­liant on its pow­ers over the grant­ing of for­eign em­ploy­ment passes and work per­mits to en­force its ed­u­ca­tional ef­forts and Tafep’s. This means that its force is un­even, hav­ing more ef­fect on busi­nesses re­liant on such hu­man re­sources than lo­cals.</p>
    <p>WHY NEW ACT IS NEEDED</p>
    <p>The merit of the sug­gested new law is that the prin­ci­ple of equal­ity may be ap­plied more con­sis­tently in ev­ery as­pect of em­ploy­ment and oc­cu­pa­tions. Un­der the present sys­tem of guide­lines and MOM ad­min­is­tra­tive en­force­ment, what the em­ploy­ers gain through ap­par­ent flex­i­bil­ity is lost through the un­cer­tain­ties of an ex­er­cise of ad­min­is­tra­tive dis­cre­tion.</p>
    <p>A ma­jor con­cern for many, no doubt, is the po­ten­tial drag on eco­nomic ef­fi­ciency and im­po­si­tion of cost over com­pli­ance with leg­is­la­tion. It must not be thought that there would nec­es­sar­ily be a net loss. There are eco­nomic gains as well to be had from a clear, trans­par­ent, cer­tain and con­sis­tent pro­tec­tion through laws. It is un­cer­tainty and risk that cre­ate in­ef­fi­ciency and run up costs.</p>
    <p>Law courts, un­like ad­min­is­tra­tive bod­ies, give full pub­licly ac­ces­si­ble, rea­soned grounds for de­ci­sions.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther, they make these de­ci­sions af­ter hear­ing ev­i­dence and wit­nesses un­der oath and sub­ject to cross-ex­am­i­na­tion in cases where the facts are dis­puted. Not only must justice be done, it must also be seen to be done – a fea­ture not ad­e­quately ful­filled even by the best of ad­min­is­tra­tive pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>More­over, the pro­posed law, as op­posed to an ap­proach re­liant mainly on education, would level the play­ing field for busi­nesses be­tween those that play by the rules and those that do not.</p>
    <p>What is fair and equal for em­ploy­ees would also be fair and equal be­tween em­ploy­ers, dis­ad­van­tag­ing only those whose in­tent or prac­tices are dis­crim­i­na­tory.</p>
    <p>FI­NAL AR­GU­MENT</p>
    <p>Will there be dis­rup­tion of our cur­rent prac­tices and dis­com­fort from hav­ing to ad­just to new ways of think­ing and re­lat­ing to oth­ers? Of course.</p>
    <p>What would be the point of an ini­tia­tive that did not make a dif­fer­ence? This is what is meant by our hu­man dig­nity. We want to give ev­ery­one equal op­por­tu­nity to make a life for him­self or her­self and then be re­spon­si­ble for the free choices made in re­spect of those op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>But this must be avail­able on a level play­ing field. No field of op­por­tu­nity is more im­por­tant in a so­ci­ety than em­ploy­ment and oc­cu­pa­tion. It makes sense to se­cure equal pro­tec­tion here.</p>
