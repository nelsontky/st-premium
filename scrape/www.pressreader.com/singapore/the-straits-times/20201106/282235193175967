    <p>In­done­sia suf­fered its first re­ces­sion in over two decades in the third quar­ter and mil­lions of peo­ple lost their jobs over the past year as the Covid-19 pan­demic bat­tered South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy, the statis­tics bureau said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) shrank by a slightly more than ex­pected 3.49 per cent year on year as house­hold con­sump­tion fell while in­vest­ment also dropped in the third quar­ter, of­fi­cial data showed.</p>
    <p>Econ­o­mists in a Reuters poll had ex­pected GDP to fall 3 per cent af­ter a 5.32 per cent con­trac­tion in the sec­ond quar­ter.</p>
    <p>While Fi­nance Min­is­ter Sri</p>
    <p>Mulyani In­drawati said in a press con­fer­ence “the worst is over”, point­ing to a pick-up in quar­terly growth, the statis­tics bureau said some 2.67 mil­lion peo­ple had lost their jobs in the year to Au­gust due to the fall­out from Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A 9.8 per cent rise in gov­ern­ment spend­ing helped soften the blow, but econ­o­mists called on more stim­u­lus to help lift the econ­omy out of the dol­drums.</p>
    <p>“Given the un­fath­omably slow pace of fis­cal stim­u­lus dis­burse­ment... the pres­sure is on mone­tary pol­icy to do more,” said OCBC Bank econ­o­mist Wel­lian Wi­ranto.</p>
    <p>In­done­sia’s first re­ces­sion since the Asian fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 1998 – nor­mally de­fined as two con­sec­u­tive quar­ters of eco­nomic con­trac­tion – comes as the coun­try has strug­gled to con­tain the out­break.</p>
    <p>With the high­est case load and Covid-19 death toll in South-east Asia, In­done­sia’s gov­ern­ment in Septem­ber in­tro­duced a sec­ond round of re­stric­tions in the cap­i­tal Jakarta as it tried to con­tain the spread of the virus amid ris­ing cases.</p>
    <p>House­hold con­sump­tion, nor­mally the econ­omy’s main growth engine, fell 4 per cent on an an­nual ba­sis, while in­vest­ment dropped 6.5 per cent. In­done­sia’s ex­ports tum­bled 10.8 per cent as global de­mand re­mained tepid amid the global pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has pledged to ac­cel­er­ate spend­ing, while Bank In­done­sia gov­er­nor Perry War­jiyo has said the cen­tral bank has fur­ther room to act af­ter 100 ba­sis points of rate cuts this year and more than US$30 bil­lion (S$40.62 bil­lion) of gov­ern­ment bond pur­chases.</p>
    <p>The data comes af­ter thou­sands of peo­ple took to the streets in the na­tion last month calling for the re­ver­sal of a con­tro­ver­sial law aimed at job cre­ation but which some say favours busi­ness in­ter­ests at the ex­pense of the en­vi­ron­ment and labour.</p>
    <p>Bank Cen­tral Asia econ­o­mist David Su­mual said the re­ces­sion was un­likely to trig­ger so­cial un­rest due to the in­crease in so­cial spend­ing for the most af­fected com­mu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>On a quar­terly, non-sea­son­ally ad­justed ba­sis, GDP grew 5.05 per cent in the June-Septem­ber pe­riod, but that was also slightly be­low ex­pec­ta­tions for a 5.34 per cent rise in the Reuters poll.</p>
