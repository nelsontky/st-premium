    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Amer­i­can rock star Jon Bon Jovi (left) hits the hot­but­ton so­cial is­sues of the United States in 2020, his band’s 15th stu­dio al­bum.</p>
    <p>It touches on the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, race re­la­tions and po­lice vi­o­lence, but the 58-year-old says he is ask­ing ques­tions, not tak­ing sides.</p>
    <p>“I say it’s top­i­cal in­stead of po­lit­i­cal... that I don’t take sides,” he said.</p>
    <p>But he added: “I tried to con­sider my­self a wit­ness to his­tory. And if I was just wit­ness­ing his­tory, I could write down the facts and maybe I could pose a ques­tion. But that’s where I wanted to leave it.”</p>
    <p>Rock group Bon Jovi, in­ducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2018, were formed in 1983 and re­main one of the big­gest acts in the Amer­i­can mu­sic in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The band are fa­mous for songs such as Bed Of Roses, It’s My Life and I’ll Be There For You.</p>
    <p>They recorded 2020 in March last year in Nashville, with plans to re­lease the al­bum in May this year.</p>
    <p>But it was post­poned to yes­ter­day and two new songs were added – Do What You Can, which fea­tures a masked Jon Bon Jovi cel­e­brat­ing work­ers on the front line of the pan­demic; and Amer­i­can Reck­on­ing, about the death of Mr Ge­orge Floyd, a black man, un­der the knee of a Min­neapo­lis po­lice­man.</p>
    <p>The song Broth­ers In Arms is a nod to for­mer Na­tional Foot­ball League quar­ter­back Colin Kaeper­nick, who sparked a na­tional de­bate when he protested against racial in­jus­tice by kneel­ing as the US na­tional an­them played be­fore games.</p>
    <p>Asked if he was con­cerned about back­lash from singing about is­sues that have di­vided Amer­i­cans, es­pe­cially ahead of the pres­i­den­tial elec­tion next month, Jon Bon Jovi said he was “aware”, but not afraid.</p>
    <p>“I’ve def­i­nitely opened my­self up to crit­i­cism,” he said. “But there are mo­ments in my day, to be hon­est with you, that I sit around and I think I’m afraid of what the re­ac­tion to the record is go­ing to be and what peo­ple are go­ing to think of me.”</p>
    <p>“And then, there are hours in the day when I say, who cares? It mat­ters that you speak. And that’s what an artist is meant to do,” he added.</p>
