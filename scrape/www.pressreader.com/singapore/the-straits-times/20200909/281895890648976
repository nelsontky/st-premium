    <p>Ja­pan’s top gov­ern­ment spokesman Yoshi­hide Suga yes­ter­day de­scribed him­self as “an or­di­nary per­son” who rose against the odds and can be an in­spi­ra­tional tale were he to be­come prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“I won my first elec­tion at the age of 47, start­ing from zero with no blood ties,” he said. “And now I’m aim­ing to be­come prime min­is­ter. Even an or­di­nary per­son like my­self can have such am­bi­tions if they make an ef­fort.”</p>
    <p>The race to be­come leader of the rul­ing Lib­eral Demo­cratic Party (LDP) – and hence the coun­try’s prime min­is­ter, as the LDP has a ma­jor­ity in the Diet – of­fi­cially kicked off with the chal­lengers fil­ing their can­di­dacy pa­pers.</p>
    <p>The LDP will choose a suc­ces­sor next Mon­day to Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, who abruptly re­signed last month over a chronic di­ges­tive ail­ment. The vic­tor will be in­au­gu­rated in the Diet next Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, 71, has two chal­lengers for the top post: for­mer de­fence chief Shigeru Ishiba, 63; and for­mer for­eign min­is­ter Fu­mio Kishida, 63.</p>
    <p>But Mr Suga – Mr Abe’s trusty lieu­tenant since he came to power in De­cem­ber 2012 and who is now his pre­ferred suc­ces­sor – is the run­away favourite, hav­ing won the back­ing of more than 70 per cent of the LDP’s law­mak­ers.</p>
    <p>Should Mr Suga be­come prime min­is­ter, the na­tive of Akita pre­fec­ture and son of straw­berry farm­ers will be a rare Ja­panese leader who is not a po­lit­i­cal blue-blood.</p>
    <p>Mr Ishiba’s fa­ther was gov­er­nor of their na­tive Tot­tori pre­fec­ture while Mr Kishida’s fa­ther and grand­fa­ther were for­mer MPs.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga has pre­sented him­self as the ideal con­ti­nu­ity can­di­date for the years of sta­bil­ity that Mr Abe has brought to volatile Ja­panese pol­i­tics, vow­ing to fol­low the out­go­ing leader’s foot­steps in rais­ing Ja­pan’s diplo­matic pro­file and to con­tinue the Abe­nomics brand of eco­nomic poli­cies to stim­u­late growth.</p>
    <p>But he dis­tanced him­self from the faults of Mr Abe’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, es­pe­cially the con­cen­tra­tion of power in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice that has been blamed for a spate of crony­ism scan­dals and doc­u­ment-tam­per­ing by bu­reau­crats al­legedly try­ing to curry favour.</p>
    <p>He also said he will cre­ate a dig­i­tal agency, not­ing that the Covid-19 cri­sis has ex­posed how woe­fully lack­ing Ja­pan is in its dig­i­tal push. Among other things, the new body will pro­mote on­line learn­ing, telemedici­ne and pa­per­less ad­min­is­tra­tive pro­cesses.</p>
    <p>Mr Suga, who has no fac­tional af­fil­i­a­tion, promised to move away from the prac­tice of “re­ward­ing” loy­al­ists with min­is­te­rial posts or fol­low­ing a “Cab­i­net wait list” based on par­lia­men­tary se­nior­ity, in­stead giv­ing pri­or­ity to re­for­m­minded peo­ple and sub­ject ex­perts.</p>
    <p>Mr Ishiba de­scribed him­self as “bru­tally hon­est and tact­less to a fault”. He called for a dis­as­ter man­age­ment agency to be es­tab­lished, and to pro­mote ru­ral re­vi­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>And Mr Kishida framed him­self as a re­lat­able can­di­date who has en­dured mul­ti­ple fail­ures, in­clud­ing fail­ing his univer­sity en­trance ex­am­i­na­tion three times. Not­ing that the ben­e­fits of Abe­nomics have not been felt by those in the mid­dle-in­come group and in ru­ral ar­eas, he vowed to tackle grow­ing in­equal­ity.</p>
