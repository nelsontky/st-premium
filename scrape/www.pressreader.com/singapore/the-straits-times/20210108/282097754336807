    <p>A lamp post in Tuas that be­came a beacon for cy­clists to leave their mark is now also the only one in Sin­ga­pore on which stick­ers can be legally pasted.</p>
    <p>Lo­cated on the west­ern­most tip of the Repub­lic, Tuas Lamp Post 1 gained fame from the nu­mer­ous self­ies it ap­peared in with cy­clists, who pho­to­graph them­selves as proof of hav­ing made it there. Some cy­clists also paste stick­ers on it to com­mem­o­rate their jour­neys.</p>
    <p>It at­tracted a dif­fer­ent kind of at­ten­tion late last month af­ter a cy­clist spot­ted work­ers peel­ing stick­ers from it and posted a pic­ture on Face­book, spark­ing laments from fel­low ped­allers.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung said the re­moval was car­ried out by street light main­te­nance con­trac­tors dur­ing a rou­tine in­spec­tion.</p>
    <p>He said he had dis­cussed the is­sue with the Land Trans­port Author­ity (LTA), which then raised the mat­ter with JTC Cor­po­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said: “We de­cided to make an ex­cep­tion for this lamp post, given that it’s a far out lo­ca­tion and a spe­cial spot to help cy­clists find their way.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese are lit­tle ex­cep­tions to the rule which do not cause dis­ameni­ties or pose safety haz­ards to the public, to brighten up life in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>He added that he should “visit this lamp post one day”.</p>
    <p>The move was widely wel­comed by the cy­cling com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Prod­uct de­sign manager Woon Tai­woon, 47, who co-founded the Love Cy­cling SG in­ter­est group, said he started the prac­tice of past­ing a sticker on Tuas Lamp Post 1 in 2014 af­ter a cy­cling trip.</p>
    <p>Mr Woon said: “It was a long jour­ney, for me, at least... and I wanted to com­mem­o­rate the ride, so I pasted my beloved ‘pedal un­til sh­iok’ sticker to make my friends laugh.</p>
    <p>“It’s en­cour­ag­ing to see Mr Ong tak­ing a light touch. It’s a sign of a ma­tur­ing so­ci­ety and that we are able to be more ac­cept­ing of or­ganic move­ments.”</p>
