    <p>Stu­dent de­vel­op­ment of­fi­cer Hui Chew, 33, bought a pair of true wire­less in-ear head­phones (TWH) last month.</p>
    <p>He joins a grow­ing num­ber of con­sumers who are ditch­ing wired and con­ven­tional wire­less head­phones for a set of TWH, which are earbuds with no con­nect­ing ca­bles.</p>
    <p>“My new ear­phones are just much more con­ve­nient and I don’t have to worry about cable en­tan­gle­ments. Plus, they are more com­fort­able com­pared with some head­phones with head­bands that might get stuck at your neck,” says Mr Chew, who paid about $300 for the Jabra Elite 75t.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, 130 mil­lion units of TWH were sold last year, al­most triple the 46 mil­lion in 2018, ac­cord­ing to tech­nol­ogy re­search firm Coun­ter­point Re­search.</p>
    <p>Ms Liz Lee, a senior an­a­lyst at the firm, says: “Con­sumers started con­sid­er­ing TWH as they are con­ve­nient and sim­ple. They en­joy the sense of free­dom, in­stead of hav­ing to un­tan­gle ca­bles they stuffed into their pock­ets or hav­ing wires dan­gle around their heads.”</p>
    <p>She reck­ons the other “big trig­ger” comes from phone com­pa­nies re­mov­ing the head­phone jack.</p>
    <p>Ap­ple did that in 2016 – for the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. At the same time, the Cu­per­tino tech gi­ant launched its first TWH – the AirPods, which are now in their sec­ond gen­er­a­tion and have a pre­mium sib­ling, the AirPods Pro.</p>
    <p>Ri­vals Sam­sung and Huawei fol­lowed suit, re­mov­ing head­phone jacks from their pre­mium smart­phones.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, the pop­u­lar­ity of TWH has soared.</p>
    <p>Like much of the tech and elec­tron­ics sec­tor, which is en­joy­ing a boost dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, sales of TWH have re­mained strong. Global sales are ex­pected to reach 221 mil­lion units this year, rep­re­sent­ing a 69 per cent year-onyear growth, Coun­ter­point</p>
    <p>Re­search fore­casts.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, TWH ac­counted for half of over­all head­phone sales from Jan­uary to July this year, ac­cord­ing to mar­ket re­search firm GfK. In com­par­i­son, TWH had only 12 per cent of the lo­cal mar­ket share in 2018 and 37 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>Mr Alexan­der Dehmel, mar­ket in­sights lead for Asia Pa­cific at GfK, says: “TWH’s in­no­va­tive form fac­tor be­came a nov­elty when this tech­nol­ogy was in­tro­duced to the mass mar­ket. And the trend will con­tinue to grow rapidly, with more brands putting out models with lower prices.”</p>
    <p>While pre­mium brands like Sennheiser and Master & Dy­namic of­fer sets that cost over $400, the likes of Chi­nese com­pany Xiaomi have models go­ing for as low as $40.</p>
    <p>Even ac­ces­sories brands like Aukey and Anker have branched into the TWH mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Mr Jason Low, a senior an­a­lyst at mar­ket re­search firm Canalys, says: “With the low en­try bar­ri­ers, we are ex­pect­ing stronger par­tic­i­pa­tion by var­i­ous in­dus­try play­ers, each show­cas­ing their unique sell­ing point.”</p>
    <p>The firm pre­dicts that by 2023, more than 400 mil­lion TWH units will be shipped glob­ally.</p>
    <p>Mar­ket­ing man­ager Ku Juan Yeou, 39, who uses a $99 Aukey EP-N5, says: “They of­fer good au­dio qual­ity and great value for money, com­pared with ex­pen­sive models like the AirPods Pro.”</p>
    <p>Mr Low of Canalys says smart­phone ven­dors bundling TWH with phones has also helped boost the head­phones’ pop­u­lar­ity.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, Sam­sung of­fered its TWH for free to those who pre­ordered its flag­ship Gal­axy Note20 phone in Au­gust and the S20 FE last week.</p>
    <p>Many pre­mium TWH also have fea­tures such as ac­tive noise can­cel­la­tion (ANC), which fil­ters out am­bi­ent noise. They are also ideal for work­outs as they are small.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tor Tarin Teo, 29, re­cently signed up for a new credit card be­cause the bank was giv­ing away a pair of AirPods Pro to new ap­pli­cants, even though she al­ready owns two sets of TWH.</p>
    <p>She pairs one set each to sep­a­rate mo­bile de­vices, which she uses for dif­fer­ent pur­poses such as work and gym work­outs.</p>
    <p>“They are light­weight and ca­ble­less, which al­lows me to con­cen­trate on my work­outs with­out wor­ry­ing about the cable be­ing caught on weights or other gym equip­ment,” says Ms Teo, who uses her new AirPods Pro for work­outs.</p>
    <p>“Hav­ing ANC helps block out sur­round­ing noise, whether I am com­mut­ing or work­ing from home.”</p>
