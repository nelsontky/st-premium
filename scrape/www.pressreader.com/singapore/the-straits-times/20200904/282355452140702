    <p>NEW YORK • Fans and large en­tourages are out at the US Open amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, but the play­ers are still be­ing cheered on, al­beit vir­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>Naomi Osaka re­ceived plenty of en­cour­age­ment and ad­vice from her mother Tamaki af­ter her sec­ond-round win, although it came in the form of emo­jis printed on a sheet of pa­per.</p>
    <p>Af­ter beat­ing Italy’s Camila Giorgi 6-1, 6-2, the 2018 US Open cham­pion was led to a court­side big screen to take a video call from her mother in Florida, which mo­men­tar­ily caught the 22-year-old off guard.</p>
    <p>What fol­lowed was a slightly awk­ward ex­change be­tween mother and daugh­ter amid au­dio con­nec­tion is­sues, be­fore Tamaki held up a sheet of pa­per with her mes­sage.</p>
    <p>“I wasn’t ex­pect­ing it (the call) to hap­pen. It was a sur­prise. Ap­par­ently my sis­ter told my mum to do it,” the Ja­panese told re­porters, be­fore de­ci­pher­ing her mother’s mes­sage.</p>
    <p>“There were four lines. Thumbs up fire, which is like ‘Good job’. There was like a Twit­ter bird, what­ever. She was say­ing, ‘Don’t go on so­cial me­dia, get some sleep’. Then, ‘Drink a lot of green juice, get some rest’. And ‘I love you’.</p>
    <p>“It was kind of a tech is­sue be­cause nor­mally, I’m able to talk to her quite soundly. It would be kind of bad if all our con­ver­sa­tions ended up like that. Def­i­nitely was a tech is­sue.”</p>
    <p>Karolina Mu­chova had also in­ter­acted with a spe­cial guest im­me­di­ately af­ter beat­ing Venus Wil­liams on Tues­day, af­ter con­nect­ing vir­tu­ally with Aus­tralian ac­tress and co­me­dian Rebel Wil­son.</p>
    <p>“It was a bit odd be­cause I re­mem­ber I was watch­ing Mu­chova play­ing Venus, and then I saw that she got a call... from Rebel Wil­son. I was like, ‘Oh that’s kind of cool’,” Osaka added. “Yeah, def­i­nitely wasn’t ex­pect­ing my mum to call to­day.”</p>
    <p>The two-time Grand Slam cham­pion also con­tin­ued her so­cial jus­tice aware­ness cam­paign, wear­ing a new mask that read Elijah McClain, a black Amer­i­can who died last year af­ter be­ing placed in an il­le­gal choke­hold by a white po­lice of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>For­mer world No. 1 Osaka, who ear­lier this week told re­porters she had seven dif­fer­ent masks em­bla­zoned with the names of po­lice bru­tal­ity vic­tims and would wear them in­ter­change­ably, said: “The big­gest thing I can gain off of in­ter­na­tional view­ers watch­ing is for them to, like, Google the name, re­search the story, find out ex­actly what’s go­ing on.</p>
    <p>“Racism isn’t just an Amer­i­can thing; like, it’s all over the world. It af­fects peo­ple lit­er­ally ev­ery day.”</p>
