    <p>Anya Tay­lor-Joy is the charis­matic star of The Queen’s Gam­bit, the wildly pop­u­lar drama se­ries that made chess sexy and be­came Net­flix’s most-watched scripted lim­ited se­ries.</p>
    <p>And the 24-year-old be­lieves she knows why.</p>
    <p>The stream­ing ser­vice re­vealed last month that a record 62 mil­lion sub­scriber ac­counts had watched at least two min­utes of the se­ries within a month of its Oct 23 de­but, pro­pel­ling it to the top of Net­flix’s most-watched list in 63 coun­tries – in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, where it was No. 1 for more than a week and in the Top 10 for four weeks.</p>
    <p>And ob­servers say this, along with the pan­demic, is driv­ing boom­ing sales of chess sets and a resur­gence of in­ter­est in the game, with chess gam­ing sites and academies re­port­ing mil­lions of new mem­bers since the show pre­miered.</p>
    <p>Chat­ting to the press re­cently via video call, Tay­lor-Joy sug­gests it is the lone­li­ness and self-doubt of her char­ac­ter – bril­liant but trou­bled chess prodigy Beth Har­mon – which makes her jour­ney from or­phan to grand­mas­ter so com­pelling.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause I think ev­ery hu­man be­ing has a part of her­self that be­lieves she doesn’t be­long, that be­lieves there is some­thing dif­fer­ent about her,” says the Bri­tish-Ar­gen­tine ac­tress, who starred in the psy­cho­log­i­cal hor­ror films Split (2016) and Glass (2019).</p>
    <p>“What’s beau­ti­ful is Beth finds a place where she be­longs, then has to learn that un­less she makes a home within her­self, she’s never go­ing to be happy or con­tent.”</p>
    <p>Tay­lor-Joy won­ders if view­ers feel­ing cut off from friends and fam­ily dur­ing the pan­demic also con­nected with Beth’s iso­la­tion – and how she then finds her tribe in the world of chess.</p>
    <p>“The show has the beau­ti­ful idea that work­ing to­gether gets you fur­ther than work­ing by your­self. And when we’re all so iso­lated, it’s nice to be re­minded of that.”</p>
    <p>The ac­tress says she is of­ten drawn to char­ac­ters who feel alone.</p>
    <p>“That’s how I iden­ti­fied for the ma­jor­ity of my child­hood and young adult­hood. I found my com­mu­nity only when I started mak­ing films and, be­fore that, there were 18 years of be­ing the lone-wolf, off­beat in­di­vid­ual,” she says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>She adds that “with these char­ac­ters, I feel I have the per­spec­tive to be able to tell their story right, and also, it’s a form of cathar­sis for me”.</p>
    <p>Still, the suc­cess of the sev­enepisode se­ries – based on the 1983 com­ing-of-age novel of the same name – has caught the ac­tress off-guard. “My brain com­pletely ex­ploded,” she says in a lilt­ing mid-At­lantic ac­cent.</p>
    <p>“And I still don’t un­der­stand the global im­pact of it. I’ve heard the fig­ures, but it’s dif­fi­cult to wrap your head around them.</p>
    <p>“I’m just very touched and proud peo­ple have cho­sen to spend their time with Beth and her story,” says the star, whose break­out role was in the pe­riod hor­ror film The Witch (2015).</p>
    <p>View­ers have also raved about Beth’s glam­orous 1950s and 1960s out­fits, but for the ac­tress, they meant more than just look­ing good.</p>
    <p>“The du­al­ity of Beth’s love and pas­sion for chess and clothes was im­por­tant to me be­cause as women, we’re of­ten told we can’t be both – you’re either a beauty or a brain and never the two shall meet and that’s so re­duc­tive and an­ti­quated,” she says.</p>
    <p>“It’s not mu­tu­ally ex­clu­sive. You’re al­lowed to be a pas­sion­ate sports per­son and also have an ap­pre­ci­a­tion of clothes. So that was im­por­tant to show.”</p>
    <p>And true to that sen­ti­ment, the ac­tress geeked out as much over the chess scenes as the cos­tumes.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded a mem­o­rable speed-chess game in which Beth takes on three play­ers. “This was one of my favourite parts of the show. It was like prob­lem-solv­ing or see­ing how quickly you could com­plete chore­og­ra­phy.”</p>
    <p>She had mem­o­rised a book of 350-plus games she was given be­fore film­ing.</p>
    <p>But when the games in those scenes were changed at the last minute, she de­cided the only way to get through the shoot was “if I learn to do each match five min­utes be­fore­hand”. That was how she mem­o­rised those speed-chess moves on three boards.</p>
    <p>“It was such an in­ter­est­ing way to chal­lenge your brain,” she says. “And the feel­ing af­ter the first take in which we got it right was prob­a­bly one of the proud­est mo­ments I’ve ever had on set.”</p>
