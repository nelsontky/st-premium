    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) icon Michael Jor­dan an­nounced on Mon­day he has pur­chased a Nascar Cup series char­ter team and re­cruited trail­blaz­ing black driver Bubba Wal­lace to race for the new out­fit next sea­son.</p>
    <p>Jor­dan, widely re­garded to be the great­est player in NBA his­tory with an es­ti­mated net worth of US$1.6 bil­lion (S$2.2 bil­lion), will be the ma­jor­ity owner in the new fran­chise with vet­eran racer Denny Ham­lin as mi­nor­ity part­ner.</p>
    <p>“Grow­ing up in North Carolina, my par­ents would take my broth­ers, sis­ters and me to races, and I’ve been a Nascar fan my whole life,” he said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>“The op­por­tu­nity to own my own rac­ing team in part­ner­ship with my friend Denny Ham­lin, and to have Bubba Wal­lace driv­ing for us, is very ex­cit­ing for me.”</p>
    <p>Jor­dan, who also owns the Char­lotte Hornets NBA team, said he hoped his own­er­ship could bring new au­di­ences to the white-dom­i­nated world of Nascar and boost in­volve­ment of mi­nori­ties.</p>
    <p>“The tim­ing seemed per­fect as</p>
    <p>Nascar is evolving and em­brac­ing so­cial change more and more,” the 57-year-old said. “In ad­di­tion to the re­cent com­mit­ment and do­na­tions I have made to com­bat sys­temic racism, I see this as a chance to ed­u­cate a new au­di­ence and open more op­por­tu­ni­ties for black peo­ple in rac­ing.”</p>
    <p>Wal­lace, the only black driver in Nascar, will spear­head the team be­hind the wheel. The 26-year-old had con­firmed ear­lier this month that he would not race again for Richard Petty Mo­tor­sports.</p>
    <p>Wal­lace has spo­ken out against racism this year in the wake of Ge­orge Floyd’s killing in Min­neapo­lis, and in June called on Nascar chiefs to ban the Con­fed­er­ate flag from race­tracks used on the cir­cuit.</p>
    <p>The flag has been a sta­ple at Nascar tracks in the south­ern United States heart­land, but it re­mains a sym­bol of slav­ery and racism for many. Nascar later banned dis­plays of the flag at its races.</p>
    <p>The driver was also in­volved in controvers­y in June, af­ter his team reported that a noose had been found hang­ing in the team garage at Tal­ladega Su­per­speed­way. An in­ves­ti­ga­tion later by the Fed­eral Bureau of In­ves­ti­ga­tion de­ter­mined he had not been the vic­tim of a hate crime and that the noose was a rope on a garage door that had been there since last year.</p>
