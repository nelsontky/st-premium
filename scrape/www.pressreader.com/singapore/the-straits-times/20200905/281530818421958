    <p>An In­dian health­care worker tak­ing a swab for a rapid anti­gen test for Covid-19 at a gro­cery shop in Ahmed­abad, in west­ern In­dia, yes­ter­day. In­dia will soon be the se­cond worst-hit coun­try in the world, over­tak­ing Brazil, and trail­ing be­hind the United States.</p>
    <p>Ra­je­w­adi, a small vil­lage in the most af­fected Ma­ha­rash­tra state, of­fers a win­dow into why In­dia’s in­fec­tions are ris­ing faster than any­where else in the world. The surge there has been blamed largely on peo­ple no longer wear­ing masks and not prac­tis­ing so­cial dis­tanc­ing. Also, com­mu­nity gath­er­ings and re­li­gious events are back.</p>
    <p>RA­JE­W­ADI/GUWA­HATI • The quaint, su­gar­cane-grow­ing vil­lage of Ra­je­w­adi in In­dia’s west did not have a sin­gle con­firmed coro­n­avirus case un­til mid-Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Now one in ev­ery four peo­ple there is pos­i­tive for the virus, with the po­lice blam­ing a lo­cal re­li­gious event for the spread.</p>
    <p>Such spurts in cases in small towns and vil­lages, where mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing have nearly van­ished and com­mu­nity gath­er­ings are back, ex­plain why In­dia’s in­fec­tions are now ris­ing faster than any­where else in the world and why the coun­try is soon set to top 4 mil­lion cases.</p>
    <p>Based on cur­rent trends, In­dia will over­take Brazil as the sec­ond­worst af­fected na­tion af­ter the United States in days.</p>
    <p>The South Asian coun­try re­ported a daily jump of 83,341 coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions yes­ter­day, tak­ing its tally to 3.94 mil­lion. The num­ber was slightly be­low the record 83,883 daily in­crease in cases it re­ported the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said 1,096 peo­ple died from Covid-19 yes­ter­day, tak­ing the toll to 68,472.</p>
    <p>Cases are ac­cel­er­at­ing i n its towns, vil­lages and smaller cities while the sit­u­a­tion has sta­bilised in the big me­trop­o­lis of New Delhi and Mum­bai.</p>
    <p>The World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion has said In­dia’s low mor­tal­ity rate could rise as the virus fans out to the vast coun­try­side, where health fa­cil­i­ties are ba­sic at best.</p>
    <p>In Ra­je­w­adi – a small vil­lage of around 360 i n In­dia’s most-af­fected state of Ma­ha­rash­tra – the au­thor­i­ties launched wide­spread test­ing only af­ter an el­derly res­i­dent was found to have died of Covid-19 on Aug 17.</p>
    <p>Since then, 91 peo­ple there have tested pos­i­tive and the vil­lage has been sealed off by po­lice.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, po­lice and res­i­dents said days be­fore the death – the vil­lage’s only fatal­ity from the dis­ease – the per­son and about 30 oth­ers had gath­ered to of­fer prayers to a lo­cal de­ity. They also had din­ner to­gether, and through­out, no one wore masks or prac­tised so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said al­most all those who at­tended have tested pos­i­tive. They have lodged a com­plaint against the or­gan­iser for vi­o­lat­ing the state’s epi­demic act.</p>
    <p>A per­son who saw the func­tion but did not at­tend said “ev­ery­one was be­hav­ing like coro­n­avirus won’t catch them”. He de­clined to be named.</p>
    <p>The vil­lage is now bar­ri­caded with bam­boo and wood, with a poster de­scrib­ing it as a con­tain­ment zone.</p>
    <p>Mr San­jay Bhos­ale, a vil­lage gro­cery shop owner whose son has con­tracted the virus, said res­i­dents had grown tired of the rules and re­sumed in­ter­ac­tions like be­fore.</p>
    <p>“A per­cep­tion was cre­ated that coro­n­avirus was just a hype, that it’s not that se­ri­ous,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Only af­ter the per­son died, peo­ple took it se­ri­ously again, but by then the virus had spread across the vil­lage.”</p>
    <p>This trend has played out across In­dia’s coun­try­side where 60 per cent of its 1.35 bil­lion peo­ple live.</p>
    <p>As more cases are re­ported on the back of higher test­ing, some states such as As­sam in the north­east have asked po­lice to tighten en­force­ment of re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Largely ru­ral As­sam has re­ported one of the high­est in­fec­tion to­tals in In­dia.</p>
    <p>In Satara, to­tal cases dou­bled be­tween Aug 6 and Aug 23, the pe­riod in which In­dia added 1 mil­lion new in­fec­tions – the fastest such jump in the world.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials warn the sit­u­a­tion will get worse be­fore get­ting bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“In April and May, peo­ple were fol­low­ing all the rules but now the men­tal­ity has changed. They have be­come ca­sual and are tak­ing coro­n­avirus lightly,” civil sur­geon Sub­hash Cha­van from Satara said.</p>
    <p>Na­tion­ally, In­dia’s test­ing has more than dou­bled in a month to over a mil­lion a day. That is about 32 tests per 1,000 peo­ple, higher than in many de­vel­op­ing coun­tries but much lower than the United States’ rate of 253 per 1,000.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials say that be­cause In­dia’s ru­ral health in­fra­struc­ture is poor, the fo­cus is on test­ing so pa­tients can be iso­lated ear­lier at home, re­serv­ing scarce hos­pi­tal beds for the most crit­i­cal.</p>
    <p>Still, only 1.76 per cent of con­firmed pa­tients have died in In­dia, com­pared with the global case fatal­ity rate of 3.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>In­dia, which is star­ing at the worst eco­nomic down­turn in its his­tory, is mov­ing to ease lock­down re­stric­tions, de­spite the rise in in­fec­tions. It is set to re­sume ur­ban metro train op­er­a­tions and al­low up to 100 peo­ple to gather for events start­ing later this month.</p>
    <p>“We have to take into con­sid­er­a­tion the eco­nomic an­gle while deal­ing with the pan­demic,” said As­sam’s health and fi­nance min­is­ter Hi­manta Biswa Sarma. “Rather than fre­quent lock­downs, we must try to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing and use masks to con­tain the virus.”</p>
