    <p>Amid tech­no­log­i­cal and trade ten­sions be­tween the United States and China, it is im­por­tant to uphold a rules-based trad­ing sys­tem and de­velop the global dig­i­tal econ­omy for the next lap of growth, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing.</p>
    <p>This re­quires com­pa­nies and pol­i­cy­mak­ers to work closely to­gether, he said at a we­bi­nar held by in­ter­na­tional mag­a­zine The Econ­o­mist yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We are all richer if we are able to share the data, use it, an­a­lyse it, and pro­duce new prod­ucts and ser­vices. But we are all poorer if we set up dig­i­tal fire­walls, frag­ment the dig­i­tal space and can’t op­ti­mise at the global level,” he added.</p>
    <p>He en­cour­aged dig­i­tal gi­ants such as Google and Pay­Pal to play their part by per­suad­ing var­i­ous govern­ments to adopt an open po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Elab­o­rat­ing, he said: “Data is not like oil, where if I con­sume it, I de­prive you of con­sum­ing it. In fact, data has an in­creas­ing rate of re­turn – the more I use it to­gether with you, the more value we cre­ate out of it.”</p>
    <p>Adding that tech­no­log­i­cal bi­fur­ca­tion will lead to the frag­men­ta­tion of tech­ni­cal stan­dards, he said Sin­ga­pore hopes to play the role of an in­te­gra­tor.</p>
    <p>“We are able to al­low sys­tems from dif­fer­ent parts of the world and dif­fer­ent stan­dards to work to­gether, and pro­vide a plat­form for peo­ple to come up with new prod­ucts and ser­vices through the cross-pol­li­na­tion of ideas.”</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to a ques­tion from the mod­er­a­tor, Mr Christo­pher Clague from The Econ­o­mist In­tel­li­gence Unit, Mr Chan said ev­ery­one has an in­ter­est in mak­ing the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) work.</p>
    <p>He fur­ther pointed out that coun­tries need to re­ject beg­gar-thyneigh­bour trade poli­cies. “Can we imag­ine go­ing back to a sys­tem where ‘might is right’? It be­hoves us all to make sure that we have a set of rules that ev­ery­one can abide by, and that there is a fair mech­a­nism for dis­pute set­tle­ment.”</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber last year, US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump re­fused to nom­i­nate new judges to the WTO’s dis­pute res­o­lu­tion body. With­out the re­quired num­ber of judges to hear cases and ap­peals, the WTO’s abil­ity to en­force its treaties has been crip­pled.</p>
    <p>On US-China re­la­tions, ICBC Stan</p>
    <p>RULES-BASED SYS­TEM CRU­CIAL</p>
    <p>Can we imag­ine go­ing back to a sys­tem where ‘might is right’? It be­hoves us all to make sure that we have a set of rules that ev­ery­one can abide by, and that there is a fair mech­a­nism for dis­pute set­tle­ment. ’’</p>
    <p>TRADE AND IN­DUS­TRY MIN­IS­TER CHAN CHUN SING, on how coun­tries need to re­ject beg­gar-thy-neigh­bour trade poli­cies.</p>
    <p>dard Bank man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and chief China econ­o­mist Jinny Yan said tit-for-tat ac­tions can be ex­pected to es­ca­late in the months lead­ing to the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>She added that firms and in­vestors should di­ver­sify not just in terms of currency risk, but also into sec­tors such as re­new­ables and health­care, and en­vi­ron­men­tal, so­cial and cor­po­rate gov­er­nance­based in­vest­ing.</p>
    <p>In this re­gard, ma­jor free trade agree­ments such as the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship and Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship pro­vide a mea­sure of pre­dictabil­ity and sta­bil­ity in the global trad­ing regime, said Mr Kimura Fuku­nari, chief econ­o­mist of the Eco­nomic Re­search In­sti­tute for Asean and East Asia.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Ms Re­becca Fa­tima Sta Maria, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the</p>
    <p>Asia-Pa­cific Eco­nomic Co­op­er­a­tion Sec­re­tar­iat, ex­pressed con­fi­dence that Asia will pro­pel the world’s eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>She urged an­a­lysts to fo­cus on the ef­forts led by “mid­dle coun­tries” such as New Zealand, Sin­ga­pore and Chile. “The move­ment on free­ing up mar­kets, en­sur­ing the flow of goods and the dig­i­tal econ­omy are not com­ing from the two big pow­ers, but from these coun­tries.”</p>
    <p>Call­ing for dig­i­tal in­clu­siv­ity and a set of global dig­i­tal stan­dards, she added: “We need to look at data flows, pri­vacy rules, data in­fra­struc­ture – and also the fact that the dig­i­tal econ­omy can be less than in­clu­sive if not man­aged.</p>
    <p>“As we go to­wards this new phase of trade and in­vest­ment, govern­ments and busi­nesses should build re­silience and en­sure that no one is left be­hind.”</p>
