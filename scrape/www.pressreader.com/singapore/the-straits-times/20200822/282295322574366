    <p>The Of­fice of the Comptrolle­r Gen­eral of Brazil (CGU) has sus­pended its ad­min­is­tra­tive en­force­ment procedure (AEP) against five sub­sidiaries of Kep­pel Corp in re­la­tion to al­leged ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties un­der the Brazil­ian Anti-Cor­rup­tion Statute.</p>
    <p>In a bourse fil­ing on Thurs­day, Kep­pel an­nounced that it had re­ceived con­fir­ma­tion of the sus­pen­sion, and will make fur­ther an­nounce­ments should ma­te­rial de­vel­op­ments arise.</p>
    <p>The AEP, which was ini­ti­ated on June 11, was against Kep­pel Off­shore & Marine (Kep­pel O&M), Kep­pel Fels, Kep­pel Fels Brasil, BrasFELS, and Pris­matic Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel had been ad­vised that the CGU would carry out fur­ther in­ves­ti­ga­tions fol­low­ing the is­suance of the no­tice.</p>
    <p>The CGU had also ap­pointed two of­fi­cials to form a panel to pre­side over the pro­ceed­ings, which would de­cide if any sum­mons would be served on the sub­sidiaries, which would then have 30 days to file a de­fence.</p>
    <p>At that point in time, Kep­pel said, none of the sub­sidiaries in ques­tion had been served with a no­tice or sum­mons. Due to the lack of fac­tual par­tic­u­lars in the no­tice, the com­pany said it was “un­able to as­sess the mat­ter or its im­pact”.</p>
    <p>The CGU was also said to be mulling over the sus­pen­sion of the AEP, pend­ing on­go­ing dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel also un­der­stood from the CGU that the AEP would not af­fect its on­go­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions with the Brazil­ian au­thor­i­ties over the pay­ment of a US$422.2 mil­lion (S$577.5 mil­lion) fine im­posed in De­cem­ber 2017 for cor­rupt pay­ments made by Zwi Sko­r­nicki, a for­mer agent of a US unit in Kep­pel O&M.</p>
    <p>These cor­rupt pay­ments were made by Sko­r­nicki for sev­eral com­pany projects in Brazil that were car­ried out with the knowl­edge or ap­proval of for­mer Kep­pel O&M ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>Kep­pel O&M had con­cealed these pay­ments by pay­ing com­mis­sions – un­der the guise of le­git­i­mate con­sult­ing agree­ments – to an in­ter­me­di­ary who then made pay­ments for the ben­e­fit of of­fi­cials of Brazil’s largest sta­te­owned oil com­pany, Petro­bras, and other par­ties.</p>
    <p>The fine is part of Kep­pel’s global res­o­lu­tion with crim­i­nal au­thor­i­ties in the United States, Brazil and Sin­ga­pore, and was to be al­lo­cated be­tween the three coun­tries, with Brazil and the US re­ceiv­ing US$211.1 mil­lion and US$105.6 mil­lion re­spec­tively. Sin­ga­pore was slated to get up to US$105.6 mil­lion, said the US De­part­ment of Jus­tice.</p>
    <p>Shares of Kep­pel Corp closed up two cents, or 0.4 per cent, at $4.63 yes­ter­day.</p>
