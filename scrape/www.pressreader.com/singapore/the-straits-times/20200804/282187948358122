    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing ac­tiv­ity in Sin­ga­pore made a sur­prise jump into ex­pan­sion ter­ri­tory last month af­ter five straight months of con­trac­tion amid the coro­n­avirus-in­duced slump.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the out­look for the rest of the year re­mains un­cer­tain amid a resur­gence in in­fec­tions in sev­eral ma­jor economies, prompt­ing a reim­po­si­tion of some lock­down mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The Pur­chas­ing Man­agers’ In­dex (PMI) rose 2.2 points last month to 50.2 – higher than the 48.6 me­dian es­ti­mate in a Bloomberg sur­vey of econ­o­mists. A PMI read­ing of over 50 in­di­cates ex­pan­sion, while one be­low 50 shows con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>The elec­tron­ics sec­tor PMI also in­creased last month, but the 1.6point rise to 49.2 kept it within con­trac­tion ter­ri­tory for a sixth month in a row, ac­cord­ing to data re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“The July ex­pan­sion read­ing is a wel­come respite for Sin­ga­pore’s man­u­fac­tur­ing,” said Ms Sophia Poh, vice-pres­i­dent of in­dus­try en­gage­ment and de­vel­op­ment at the Sin­ga­pore In­sti­tute of Pur­chas­ing and Ma­te­ri­als Man­age­ment, which com­piles the PMI.</p>
    <p>Over­all, man­u­fac­tur­ing PMI had been in re­cov­ery af­ter hit­ting a trough of 44.7 in April – the low­est since Novem­ber 2008 dur­ing the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Man­u­fac­tur­ing, which ac­counts for nearly a quar­ter of the do­mes­tic econ­omy, has helped put a floor un­der the pre­cip­i­tous de­cline in gross do­mes­tic prod­uct led by the ser­vices sec­tor – re­tail, food and bev­er­age, travel and hos­pi­tal­ity – that is likely to pull Sin­ga­pore into its deep­est re­ces­sion since in­de­pen­dence.</p>
    <p>The coun­try ended the most strin­gent of its t wo-month cir­cuit breaker mea­sures on June 1, and fur­ther re­laxed curbs on June 19 to al­low more shops and busi­nesses to re­sume nor­mal op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>The July PMI in­crease was at­trib­uted to an im­prove­ment in new or­ders, a first-time ex­pan­sion in new ex­ports and fac­tory out­put, as well as a faster rate of ex­pan­sion in the in­ven­tory in­dex.</p>
    <p>Slower con­trac­tions were recorded for the in­dexes of fin­ished goods, im­ports and in­put prices, while the or­der back­log in­dex ex­panded for the first time af­ter five months of con­trac­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Ms Poh said man­u­fac­tur­ers are still con­cerned about the out­look due to per­sis­tent uncer­tain­ties around lock­down mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The resur­gence in in­fec­tions and the United States-China trade con­flict have raised fears of re­newed dis­rup­tion of sup­ply chains and damp­en­ing of global de­mand, she added.</p>
    <p>Those con­cerns were re­flected in yes­ter­day’s data, with in­dexes for em­ploy­ment and sup­plier de­liv­er­ies con­tract­ing at faster rates in July than June. The over­all em­ploy­ment in­dex for the man­u­fac­tur­ing sec­tor has now posted con­trac­tions for six con­sec­u­tive months.</p>
    <p>Ms Se­lena Ling, head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank, said the faster pace of con­trac­tions in the em­ploy­ment and sup­plier de­liv­er­ies in­dexes sug­gests that im­prove­ment in man­u­fac­tur­ing sen­ti­ment has yet to ex­tend to greater hir­ing in­ten­tions, and that global sup­ply dis­rup­tions have eased but are yet to fully sub­side.</p>
    <p>“Given the long tail of the Covid-19 pan­demic, the se­cond-half 2020 re­cov­ery may also be bumpy and po­ten­tially run into some speed bumps ahead,” Ms Ling said.</p>
    <p>The elec­tron­ics PMI failed to resur­face above the 50-point mark, de­spite re­cent earn­ings re­ports that show global tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies like Ap­ple, Ama­zon, Face­book and Al­pha­bet thriv­ing amid the pan­demic as con­sumers work, shop and en­ter­tain from home.</p>
    <p>“The ques­tion is if Sin­ga­pore’s elec­tron­ics in­dus­try can ride this wave to cap­i­talise on the broader in­dus­try trends,” said Ms Ling.</p>
    <p>UOB econ­o­mist Barn­abas Gan said fur­ther ex­pan­sions in Sin­ga­pore’s head­line PMI will de­pend on the global man­u­fac­tur­ing out­look for the rest of the year.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic prog­no­sis may still stay soft in the se­cond half, given the slow­down in global de­mand... amid the un­cer­tainty over how the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion could evolve... and the risk of a spike in in­fec­tion in Sin­ga­pore’s key trad­ing part­ners,” added Mr Gan.</p>
    <p>Re­gional man­u­fac­tur­ing PMI re­ports for last month re­flect a mixed pic­ture. China has led the re­cov­ery, fol­lowed by Tai­wan. How­ever, South Korea, In­done­sia, Thai­land and Ja­pan are still in con­trac­tion ter­ri­tory. PMI dropped in Malaysia back to the 50 mark, the Philip­pines went into deeper con­trac­tion, while Viet­nam slumped back to be­low the 50-point level.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Ling: “This sug­gests that while the man­u­fac­tur­ing re­cov­ery is likely to sus­tain in the months ahead, the rest of Asia may lag be­hind China’s first-in-first-out mo­men­tum.”</p>
