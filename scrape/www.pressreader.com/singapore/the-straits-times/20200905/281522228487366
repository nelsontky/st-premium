    <p>In­dus­trial de­sign­ers Ed­mund Zhang and Esli Ee see beauty in waste mar­ble, ce­ramic and wood thrown away by ren­o­va­tion con­trac­tors af­ter the com­ple­tion of a project.</p>
    <p>These “of­f­cuts” can be up­cy­cled by crafts­men and tech­ni­cians into a home decor item, says Mr Zhang, 29, who co-founded Of­f­cut Fac­tory with Mr Ee, an ini­tia­tive that turns con­struc­tion waste into source ma­te­rial to make con­tem­po­rary life­style ob­jects.</p>
    <p>“Many of these still-us­able of­f­cuts have a beauty of their own and need not be dis­carded,” says Mr Zhang.</p>
    <p>“We re­mem­ber how one owner ac­tively hoards a se­lec­tion of his favourite mar­ble of­f­cuts in his fac­tory space, as he finds it a pity to throw them away.</p>
    <p>“That led us to think how we could bet­ter re­frame our per­cep­tion and treat­ment of ma­te­rial waste through the lens of de­sign.”</p>
    <p>With help from the De­signSin­ga­pore Coun­cil’s (DSG) new Good De­sign Re­search fund­ing pro­gramme, a to­tal of seven lo­cal firms – in­clud­ing Of­f­cut Fac­tory – were awarded up to $35,000 each in July to fo­cus on is­sues such as the fu­ture of work, in­equal­ity and so­cial co­he­sion, and en­vi­ron­men­tal and busi­ness sus­tain­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>An­other cham­pion of re­duc­ing waste is Mr Mor­gan Yeo, co­founder of Roger&Sons, whose fam­ily-owned be­spoke wood­work­ing com­pany has been sav­ing lo­cal trees felled for ur­ban de­vel­op­ment since 2018.</p>
    <p>The com­pany was set up in 1988 as JR&P, and was re­branded in 2018 as Roger&Sons.</p>
    <p>“We work in a sun­set in­dus­try,” says the 32-year-old who, to­gether with brothers Lin­coln, 29, and Ryan, 25, turn aban­doned logs from angsana and suar wood into durable home decor items and fur­ni­ture.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing the younger pres­ence in this in­dus­try, we see the im­por­tance of elim­i­nat­ing meth­ods that are detri­men­tal to the earth and re­vi­tal­is­ing a dy­ing trade,” says Mr Yeo, who notes that most com­pa­nies that are still around have been us­ing the same meth­ods and ma­te­ri­als for decades.</p>
    <p>He says there are few com­pa­nies in Sin­ga­pore to­day that are de­vel­op­ing sus­tain­able ma­te­ri­als that can be used in the wood­work­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>His firm is us­ing the funds from DSG to con­duct re­search and de­vel­op­ment on lo­cal wood.</p>
    <p>The goal is to come up with ecofriendl­y prac­tices and medi­ums used in the wood­work­ing process to sta­bilise lo­cal wood so that it can be more durable when fash­ioned into pieces of fur­ni­ture.</p>
    <p>Be­sides sus­tain­abil­ity, the re­search will also help the firm min­imise its car­bon foot­print and, Mr Yeo hopes, in­spire other in­dus­try play­ers to do the same. “This will help pave the way for self­suf­fi­ciency and re­duce the reliance on im­ported ma­te­ri­als,” he adds.</p>
    <p>These are the solutions DSG wants to sup­port and de­velop in the lo­cal de­sign in­dus­try for Sin­ga­pore to be­come an in­no­va­tion-driven econ­omy.</p>
    <p>For DSG ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor Mark Wee, cli­mate change, sus­tain­abil­ity and an age­ing pop­u­la­tion are global is­sues. “The world ur­gently needs bold and bet­ter hu­man-cen­tred in­no­va­tions and we are con­fi­dent that our de­sign­ers have the skills to de­sign for these needed solutions,” he says.</p>
    <p>The first open call for DSG’s fund­ing pro­gramme from March 18 to April 30 re­ceived 60 el­i­gi­ble sub­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>These were eval­u­ated by a panel of mem­bers recog­nised by the de­sign in­dus­try for their ex­per­tise in busi­ness, tech­nol­ogy and de­sign. They in­clude Mr Yang Yeo, cre­ative of­fi­cer at global in­te­grated mar­ket­ing solutions com­pany Hakuhodo In­ter­na­tional; and Mr Tai Lee Siang, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of BuildSG at the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>The other firms that made the cut are de­sign prac­tice Agency; col­lab­o­ra­tive de­sign­ers Com­mon Ground; pro­to­typ­ing spe­cial­ists Pro­duce Work­shop; mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary prac­tice For­est & Whale; and wom­enswear de­signer Gin­lee Stu­dio.</p>
    <p>The next open call for the fund­ing pro­gramme is ex­pected to be on Oct 13.</p>
    <p>Adds Mr Wee, who chaired the eval­u­a­tion panel: “In or­der to de­sign solutions to mit­i­gate real-world prob­lems, it has be­come even more crit­i­cal now for our de­sign­ers to</p>
    <p>relook how, why and what they de­sign; re-ex­am­ine the ma­te­ri­als, tech­nol­ogy and pro­cesses they work with to stay rel­e­vant; and study the im­pact their works have on our so­ci­ety as a whole.”</p>
    <p>Solv­ing real-world prob­lems on a global scale pro­vided the im­pe­tus for Sin­ga­pore-based mul­ti­dis­ci­plinary de­sign prac­tice For­est & Whale to turn cur­rent forms of food pack­ag­ing on their head through de­sign.</p>
    <p>The com­pany de­signed a salad bowl con­tainer made from wa­ter­sol­u­ble and com­postable ma­te­ri­als that is re­us­able and re­duces reliance on non-biodegrad­able plas­tics.</p>
    <p>“Our project’s ob­jec­tive is to de­sign and de­velop a range of prod­ucts and solutions to im­prove ex­ist­ing food de­liv­ery and take­away sys­tems, so as to re­duce the amount of sin­gle-use plas­tic waste gen­er­ated by these ac­tiv­i­ties,” says Mr Gus­tavo Mag­gio, co-founder and cre­ative direc­tor at For­est & Whale.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old was mo­ti­vated to make a dif­fer­ence af­ter he learnt that the amount of waste dis­posed of in Sin­ga­pore in­creased sev­en­fold over the last 40 years, ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Gov­ern­ment’s Zero Waste Mas­ter­plan re­leased last year.</p>
    <p>At this rate, Se­makau Landfill, Sin­ga­pore’s only landfill, will run out of space by 2035.</p>
    <p>“When it comes to sus­tain­abil­ity, there is no sin­gle best so­lu­tion,” says Mr Mag­gio, an ar­chi­tect and de­signer who grew up in Ar­gentina and worked in Europe. He moved to Sin­ga­pore in 2010.</p>
    <p>“We be­lieve Sin­ga­pore and Sin­ga­pore­ans are ready for more sus­tain­abil­ity in the way we con­sume and dis­pose. We hope some of our re­search and de­sign solutions help make that tran­si­tion smoother.”</p>
