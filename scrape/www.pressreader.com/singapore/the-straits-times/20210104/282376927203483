    <p>WASH­ING­TON • A ma­jor av­enue for global money laun­der­ing and tax eva­sion has been closed off by a new law re­quir­ing dis­clo­sure of own­ers of US shell com­pa­nies used to hide bil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>The Cor­po­rate Trans­parency Act was in­cluded in the US de­fence ap­pro­pri­a­tions Bill passed into law by Congress last Fri­day, over­rid­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s veto.</p>
    <p>The law forces “ben­e­fi­cial own­ers” be­hind shell com­pa­nies to re­port their iden­ti­ties to the US Trea­sury’s Fi­nan­cial Crimes En­force­ment Net­work, or FinCEN.</p>
    <p>While the law still grants them pro­tec­tion from pub­lic knowl­edge – only the Trea­sury and law en­force­ment will be able to ac­cess the FinCEN data­base – trans­parency ad­vo­cates say it is a huge step against klep­to­crats, or­gan­ised crime and rich tax evaders who have been able to anony­mously wash their sus­pect wealth through the world’s largest econ­omy.</p>
    <p>“For years, ex­perts rou­tinely ranked anony­mous shell com­pa­nies... as the big­gest weak­ness in our anti-money laun­der­ing safe­guards,” said Mr Ian Gary, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the Fact Coali­tion, which lob­bied for the leg­is­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“It’s the sin­gle most im­por­tant step we could take to bet­ter pro­tect our fi­nan­cial sys­tem from abuse.”</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions es­ti­mates that US$800 bil­lion (S$1.05 tril­lion) to US$2 tril­lion is laun­dered through the global fi­nan­cial sys­tem ev­ery year.</p>
    <p>While much of the at­ten­tion has fo­cused on tax havens like Panama and the Cay­man Is­lands, ex­perts say that the size of the US econ­omy, and its abil­ity to ab­sorb bil­lions of dol­lars without no­tice, has made it cru­cial for con­vert­ing il­licit funds into le­git­i­mate as­sets.</p>
    <p>Early last year, the Tax Jus­tice Net­work ranked the Cay­man Is­lands and the United States as the global lead­ers in help­ing peo­ple con­ceal their fi­nances from law and tax en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>PROP­ERTY AND ART</p>
    <p>Mr Gary Kal­man, the US direc­tor of Trans­parency In­ter­na­tional, said the Cor­po­rate Trans­parency Act</p>
    <p>was “foun­da­tional” for fight­ing money laun­der­ing.</p>
    <p>De­spite geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions, he pointed out that money has flowed into the United States from China and Rus­sia be­cause it was the eas­i­est place to laun­der it, through prop­er­ties, cor­po­rate as­sets, se­cu­ri­ties and art.</p>
    <p>“We are the eas­i­est place in the world to set up an anony­mous com­pany,” he told Agence France-Presse be­fore the law had passed.</p>
    <p>“We are the dream of any klep­to­crat or crim­i­nal to hide money.” By forc­ing com­pany own­ers to di­vulge their iden­ti­ties, he said, the US is es­tab­lish­ing a “global norm” for the world’s fi­nan­cial sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“By chok­ing off ac­cess to the ad­vanced economies, you are mak­ing it much harder. You are up­ping the cost and the like­li­hood of get­ting caught,” he said.</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­tion sets penal­ties for not re­port­ing a com­pany’s ben­e­fi­cial own­ers of up to two years in jail and a US$10,000 fine.</p>
    <p>Fact said the law could re­sult in a sharp drop in all-cash busi­ness trans­ac­tions, es­pe­cially in real es­tate, a favoured way for out­siders to move large sums into the US econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Fact also says that anony­mous com­pa­nies un­der­pin trade in coun­ter­feit lux­ury goods, phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals and in­dus­trial equip­ment.</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­tion is not per­fect, say an­a­lysts. The FinCEN data­base will not be open to the pub­lic or me­dia, whose ef­forts have pro­duced the big­gest sto­ries about money laun­der­ing.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the In­ter­na­tional Con­sor­tium of In­ves­tiga­tive Jour­nal­ists was be­hind the ex­plo­sive re­lease in 2016 of the Panama Pa­pers, some 11.5 mil­lion doc­u­ments de­tail­ing se­cret com­pa­nies set up in the Cen­tral Amer­i­can coun­try.</p>
    <p>In that case, en­force­ment au­thor­i­ties around the world made use of the files made pub­lic by re­porters, which showed prom­i­nent politi­cians, celebri­ties and busi­ness peo­ple hid­ing money off­shore.</p>
    <p>Al­though they will have all the new data, the US Trea­sury and law en­force­ment have lim­ited ca­pac­ity to comb through files them­selves.</p>
    <p>“We think that the data­base should be pub­lic,” said Mr Kal­man.</p>
