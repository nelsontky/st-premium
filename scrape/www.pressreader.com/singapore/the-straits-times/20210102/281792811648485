    <p>MANILA • The Philip­pines will block for­eign trav­ellers from the US from to­mor­row, fol­low­ing the de­tec­tion of a new and more in­fec­tious coro­n­avirus vari­ant in that coun­try, pres­i­den­tial spokesman Harry Roque said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“For­eign pas­sen­gers com­ing from the US, or who have been to the US within 14 days pre­ced­ing ar­rival in the Philip­pines, shall be pro­hib­ited from en­ter­ing the coun­try ef­fec­tive 12.01am Manila time of Jan 3... un­til Jan 15,” he said.</p>
    <p>For­eign­ers who ar­rive be­fore 12.01am to­mor­row from the United States, or who have been to the US within 14 days be­fore com­ing to the Philip­pines, will be al­lowed to enter the coun­try.</p>
    <p>How­ever, these trav­ellers must un­dergo “an ab­so­lute fa­cil­i­ty­based 14-day quar­an­tine pe­riod”, even if their Covid-19 tests show neg­a­tive re­sults, Mr Roque added.</p>
    <p>He said Filipino cit­i­zens com­ing from the US, or who have been to the US within 14 days im­me­di­ately be­fore land­ing in the Philip­pines – in­clud­ing those ar­riv­ing af­ter to­mor­row – will be al­lowed to enter the coun­try.</p>
    <p>The US is the 21st place sub­jected by the Philip­pines to a 14-day en­try ban on flights and for­eign trav­ellers to pre­vent the spread of the new strain.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines ini­tially i mposed a tem­po­rary en­try ban on flights and for­eign­ers from Bri­tain – where the new vari­ant was first found – from Dec 24 un­til Dec 31. The govern­ment ex­tended the ban to Jan 15 and in­cluded 19 other coun­tries and ter­ri­to­ries with the re­ported new strain.</p>
    <p>The Philip­pines now has 475,820 confirmed Covid-19 cases, in­clud­ing 9,248 deaths.</p>
    <p>In his New Year’s mes­sage, Pres­i­dent Ro­drigo Duterte voiced con­fi­dence that the coun­try will sail through the pan­demic and see brighter days this year.</p>
    <p>“The Covid-19 pan­demic may have cost us so many lives and ma­te­rial re­sources, but we also learnt so much from it,” he said. “We re­alised the value of hu­man life and our re­la­tion­ships with each other. We un­der­stood what it means to be a fam­ily, a com­mu­nity, a na­tion. We learnt to share and to look af­ter the wel­fare of our brethren.”</p>
    <p>He added: “Now, we march on to a new year wiser, stronger and more pre­pared for the challenges ahead.”</p>
