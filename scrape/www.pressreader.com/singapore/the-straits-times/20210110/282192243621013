    <p>Ms Mar­lene Tan used to meet her friends Yao Shuy­ing and Rachel Soon once a month, usu­ally over a restau­rant meal or cock­tails at a bar.</p>
    <p>Like typ­i­cal besties, their con­ver­sa­tion top­ics re­volved around work, trav­els and fam­ily life.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic put paid to th­ese meet­ings at the start, but it also strength­ened and deep­ened their friend­ship.</p>
    <p>With bor­ders closed and f ewer dis­trac­tions, Covid-19 gave the trio an op­por­tu­nity to pri­ori­tise spend­ing time with and sup­port­ing one another.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, 30, a se­nior man­ager at Work­force Singapore’s ca­reer ad­vi­sors pro­gramme of­fice, says: “Iron­i­cally, we now see one another much more than be­fore the pan­demic. We used to meet for some­one’s birth­day, or when some­one scored a pro­mo­tion or fin­ished a big project. But now, we are so close that we don’t need any spe­cial rea­son to hang out.”</p>
    <p>Nowa­days, they visit one another’s homes al­most ev­ery week and es­pe­cially love play­ing with Ms Soon’s toy poo­dle, Can­non.</p>
    <p>Another of their favourite hangouts is Sen­tosa’s Tan­jong Beach, where they can swim, sun­tan and while away the week­ends.</p>
    <p>They still meet for meals at restau­rants, but Ms Tan and Ms Yao, who live one bus stop away from each other, have also met im­promptu sev­eral times for meals at the hawker cen­tre nearby, as well as gro­cery runs at a su­per­mar­ket close by.</p>
    <p>Ms Yao, 34, a user ex­pe­ri­ence con­sul­tant, says: “In the past, we never just hung out in our neigh­bour­hood. But now, we have learnt to ap­pre­ci­ate the sim­ple ac­tiv­i­ties we can do to­gether, which can be just as mean­ing­ful as an over­seas trip.”</p>
    <p>At a time when people were forced to adapt to new ways of work­ing and liv­ing, the trio were also quick to en­cour­age one another.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, Ms Soon, 28, a busi­ness an­a­lyst and part-time yoga in­struc­tor, felt ner­vous about do­ing yoga poses on In­sta­gram Live dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>She says: “When I knew Mar­lene and Shuy­ing were watch­ing my live stream and cheer­ing me on through their pres­ence and on­line com­ments, I felt very en­cour­aged.”</p>
    <p>One day in Novem­ber, af­ter Ms Soon had made a mis­take at work and felt es­pe­cially down, Ms Tan and Ms Yao were quick to com­fort her in their shared What­sApp chat group.</p>
    <p>That evening, they sur­prised Ms Soon by drop­ping by her home with Star­bucks cof­fee and talked through her day.</p>
    <p>“It was very un­ex­pected and sweet of them,” says Ms Soon. “I felt re­ally blessed to have such sup­port dur­ing that tough pe­riod.”</p>
    <p>Their con­ver­sa­tion top­ics are now more per­sonal and in­ti­mate. They con­fide in one another about chal­lenges they face at work and with their fam­i­lies, as well as their fears and hopes for the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan says: “When I felt trapped at home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, Shuy­ing and Rachel were the friends I thought about the most, and the ones I most wanted to talk to.</p>
    <p>“In this way, the Covid-19 pe­riod gave us time to re­flect on which friends mat­ter most to us, as well as to in­vest in and trea­sure th­ese friend­ships.”</p>
