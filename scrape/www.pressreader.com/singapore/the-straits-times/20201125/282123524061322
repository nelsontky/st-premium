    <p>Eighty-eight donors were recog­nised for their con­tri­bu­tions, to­talling $8.67 mil­lion, to var­i­ous her­itage causes last year. The value of in-kind sup­port, cash do­na­tions as well as arte­fact gifts and loans was about one-third higher than in 2018, said the Na­tional</p>
    <p>Her­itage Board.</p>
    <p>Af­ter 16 years, a pair of watches that once be­longed to the late Mr and Mrs Lee Kuan Yew were re­united in the Na­tional Mu­seum of Sin­ga­pore’s (NMS) Sin­ga­pore His­tory Gallery last year.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lee’s watch is on loan to the mu­seum from the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) for dis­play in a section that show­cases the found­ing fa­ther’s le­gacy as a lawyer. The show­case in­cludes his watch and other per­sonal items.</p>
    <p>The pair of Rolex watches was given by the Sin­ga­pore Union of</p>
    <p>Postal and Telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions Work­ers (SUPTW) to the cou­ple in 1953, in ap­pre­ci­a­tion of Mr Lee’s suc­cess­ful rep­re­sen­ta­tion of 1,000 clerks in a wage dis­pute ar­bi­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Loans and do­na­tions of items have en­abled the Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB) to “make her­itage rel­e­vant to Sin­ga­pore­ans and help shape the fu­ture for tomorrow’s gen­er­a­tions”, said Ms Chang Hwee Nee, NHB’s chief ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>She was speak­ing at a 2019 Pa­tron of Her­itage Awards vir­tual cer­e­mony held yes­ter­day to hon­our her­itage sup­port­ers.</p>
    <p>Eighty-eight donors were recog­nised for their con­tri­bu­tions, to­talling $8.67 mil­lion, to var­i­ous her</p>
    <p>itage causes last year. The value of in-kind sup­port, cash do­na­tions as well as arte­fact gifts and loans was about one-third higher than in 2018, said the NHB.</p>
    <p>The watches had been sep­a­rated since 2003, when the Amal­ga­mated Union of Pub­lic Em­ploy­ees (AUPE) made a suc­cess­ful bid of $100,000 for Mrs Lee’s watch at the Sotheby’s-Lee Kuan Yew Fam­ily Auc­tion. AUPE then do­nated the watch to NTUC.</p>
    <p>AUPE was formed in Septem­ber 1959 and in­cluded the SUPTW and the Postal and Telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions Uni­formed Staff Union.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on be­half of NTUC – among the pa­trons hon­oured by NHB – Mr Steve Tan, direc­tor of NTUC’s Ong Teng Cheong Labour Lead­er­ship In­sti­tute, said the watches rep­re­sented the sym­bi­otic re­la­tion­ship be­tween NTUC</p>
    <p>and the Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party (PAP), which has lasted to this day.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides Mr Lee rep­re­sent­ing the work­ers and help­ing them to be back-paid 28 months’ salary each, the watches also sym­bol­ise how his in­volve­ment with the unions seeded the roots of the PAP,” said Mr Tan.</p>
    <p>NHB chair­man Yeoh Chee Yan called last year a “cel­e­bra­tory year” that marked Sin­ga­pore’s bi­cen­ten­nial, and high­lighted the sup­port of pa­trons for the slew of ex­hi­bi­tions, fes­ti­vals and ini­tia­tives through do­na­tions, in-kind con­tri­bu­tions, loans of arte­facts, and ser­vices.</p>
    <p>She said the con­tri­bu­tions were “vi­tal to our con­tin­ued ef­forts to main­tain our cul­tural her­itage, en­sur­ing that what we have in­her­ited from the past will con­tinue to be­come a last­ing le­gacy for fu­ture gen­er­a­tions”.</p>
    <p>Mr Paul Supra­ma­niam, who was given a Sup­porter of Her­itage award for lend­ing fam­ily heir­looms to the In­dian Her­itage Cen­tre, said that he made the loans in the hope that the stories told of his rel­a­tives and an­ces­tors would help to in­spire Sin­ga­pore’s small Sri Lankan Tamil pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“Every­body is a de­scen­dant of some­one. We all have a his­tory that is sub­lim­i­nally im­printed to make us who we are today. It is im­por­tant that we har­ness the good as­pects and lessons learnt from our his­tory to en­rich so­ci­ety and our mul­ti­cul­tur­al­ism,” said the lawyer, whose con­tri­bu­tions to the her­itage cen­tre in­cluded medals awarded to his late fa­ther, Dr James Mark Jeyase­basingam Supra­ma­niam, for his World War II gal­lantry.</p>
