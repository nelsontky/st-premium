    <p>Af­ter nearly two years of train­ing, John (not his real name) and his fel­low cadet pi­lots were look­ing for­ward to fly­ing for the na­tional car­rier.</p>
    <p>In­stead, they will be without a job when their train­ing ends in a few months.</p>
    <p>With too many pi­lots and too few flights amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore Air­lines (SIA) said last month that it was let­ting go of about half of its cadet pi­lots and all cabin crew trainees.</p>
    <p>The rest, in­clud­ing John, who is in his 30s, will also have to leave, but af­ter their train­ing is com­pleted.</p>
    <p>He told The Sun­day Times: “My dream to take to the skies has to be post­poned. In three months, we will be re­leased by SIA but with a prom­ise that we will be called back when air travel picks up again.”</p>
    <p>Since he started his train­ing, he has got by on a monthly al­lowance of less than $1,000.</p>
    <p>SIA foots the en­tire cost of the train­ing – about $250,000 per cadet.</p>
    <p>But come next year, John could be work­ing in an en­gi­neer­ing firm or tak­ing on cor­po­rate roles at a fi­nan­cial com­pany.</p>
    <p>So far, though, he has not man­aged to land a job, he said, and will take “any­thing that comes my way”.</p>
    <p>The SIA group, which in­cludes the flag­ship air­line, SilkAir and Scoot, jointly em­ployed about 3,200 pi­lots and al­most 11,000 cabin crew at the start of the year.</p>
    <p>De­spite cost-cut­ting mea­sures such as vol­un­tary and com­pul­sory no-pay leave, it be­gan its re­trench­ment ex­er­cise last month, slash­ing about 20 per cent of its head­count.</p>
    <p>About 2,400 staff have been laid off. An­other 1,900 roles will be elim­i­nated through nat­u­ral at­tri­tion, a re­cruit­ment freeze and vol­un­tary de­par­ture schemes.</p>
    <p>Pi­lots and cabin crew have had to make ca­reer switches. Not all of them have re­stricted their am­bi­tions to jobs that tap their SIA-re­fined hospi­tal­ity and charm.</p>
    <p>Some have started their own on­line bak­ery shops. Oth­ers have re­turned to help out in fam­ily busi­nesses. Still oth­ers have ap­plied to be teach­ers at es­tab­lish­ments such as EtonHouse, or go back to school them­selves.</p>
    <p>Said a 24-year-old who was an air stew­ardess with SIA un­til last month: “Be­cause I am young, there is less in­er­tia (and so it is eas­ier) to move on to an­other job.”</p>
    <p>She had been with SIA for nearly a year, in­clud­ing the three months for train­ing, but re­signed when planes stopped tak­ing off.</p>
    <p>She is now work­ing in a food and bev­er­age com­pany where her job in­cludes stock or­der­ing and tak­ing, as well as de­liv­er­ies.</p>
    <p>Be­fore she quit, she was paid her ba­sic pay of about $1,500 a month, un­like the more than 6,000 other staff in the SIA group who were on no-pay leave, as part of cost-cut­ting mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“I might not re­turn to SIA af­ter this. It’s just too un­cer­tain, and I can’t imag­ine go­ing through the train­ing pro­cesses again,” she said.</p>
    <p>A Malaysian cabin crew mem­ber in his 30s will re­ceive his last pay cheque from SIA in De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>The tran­si­tion is more oner­ous for him, with many com­pa­nies fo­cused on hir­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite his hav­ing worked in Sin­ga­pore for 15 years, first as a man­ager of a com­pany which re­ported an­nual earn­ings of $30 mil­lion, then at SIA.</p>
    <p>He joined the air­line be­cause he al­ways “had a pas­sion to fly and wanted to learn the work cul­ture”, but may now have to re­turn to Malaysia, where his el­derly par­ents live, if he does not se­cure a job.</p>
    <p>He said: “I am grate­ful for the op­por­tu­nity and what the com­pany has done. There is no ill will, but I want to stay in Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Even with the re­trench­ments, closed bor­ders and the lack of a do­mes­tic mar­ket mean SIA’s re­main­ing em­ploy­ees are still far in ex­cess of what is needed.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore is work­ing with coun­tries to pro­gres­sively re­sume more flights and bring trav­ellers back, nor­mal ser­vice is un­likely to re­turn un­til at least 2022, ex­perts have said.</p>
    <p>SIA told The Sun­day Times that nearly 2,700 of the group’s ex­ist­ing staff who are not af­fected by the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise have had to take on other in­terim work.</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity – about 2,100 – work in pub­lic-fac­ing roles at pub­lic trans­port sta­tions, so­cial ser­vice of­fices and hos­pi­tals.</p>
    <p>An­other 600 have been linked up with tem­po­rary jobs in var­i­ous com­pa­nies. SIA de­clined to re­veal what these are.</p>
    <p>The fig­ures in­clude some pi­lots. Those who are earn­ing less than their ba­sic pay in their tem­po­rary job roles will have the dif­fer­ence topped up by SIA.</p>
    <p>Ren Ci Hos­pi­tal, which pro­vides med­i­cal, nurs­ing and re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive care for the el­derly, re­cently trained 30 cabin crew to help with its op­er­a­tions, join­ing other en­ti­ties such as Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal and Ng Teng Fong Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal that have been a refuge for grounded air­line staff.</p>
    <p>One of the 30 new em­ploy­ees at Ren Ci is Scoot cabin crew mem­ber Noor Seha Sayemi, a mother of three.</p>
    <p>She said the work was a life­line. “Both of my par­ents are un­der my care fi­nan­cially too. Though I have a small-scale, home-based busi­ness sell­ing desserts, it is not fi­nan­cially sus­tain­able in the long term (without the Ren Ci job).”</p>
    <p>In the past month or so since she be­gan car­ing for the nurs­ing home res­i­dents, the 30-year-old has learnt how to take their vi­tal health statis­tics, as well as sim­ple Hokkien and other Chi­nese ex­pres­sions.</p>
    <p>She said her pro­fes­sional in­stinct to be proac­tive and em­pa­thetic fits well with her new job scope, but noth­ing will beat the joy of flights re­sum­ing.</p>
    <p>“I miss fly­ing. I miss my fel­low crew, I miss do­ing what I love,” she said.</p>
