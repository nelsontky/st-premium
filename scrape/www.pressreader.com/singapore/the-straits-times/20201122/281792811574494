    <p>Chaotic scenes of men in white robes and match­ing tur­bans cel­e­brat­ing the re­turn of In­done­sian fire­brand cleric Rizieq Shi­hab from self-ex­ile in Saudi Ara­bia have hogged the me­dia spot­light for over a week now.</p>
    <p>Car­ry­ing posters of their “grand imam” and chant­ing “Al­lahu Ak­bar” (“God is great”), thousands wel­comed him at Jakarta’s in­ter­na­tional air­port on Nov 10, caus­ing massive jams and spark­ing fears of a coron­avirus spike in a coun­try with nearly half a mil­lion cases and more than 15,000 deaths – the high­est in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>They are sup­port­ers of the Is­lamic De­fend­ers Front, or Front Pem­bela Is­lam (FPI), a hard­line group Mr Rizieq founded a few months af­ter the fall of strong­man pres­i­dent Suharto in 1998.</p>
    <p>No­to­ri­ous for re­li­gious in­tol­er­ance and acts of vig­i­lan­tism, raid­ing bars dur­ing the Ra­madan fast­ing month and at­tack­ing mi­nori­ties with ma­chetes and swords, the FPI started as a civil group with back­ing from the po­lice and mil­i­tary to keep a lid on vice.</p>
    <p>Once on the fringes of In­done­sian pol­i­tics, the group, which claims five mil­lion mem­bers, has grown in­creas­ingly bold in de­mand­ing that syariah law be made of­fi­cial in the world’s largest Mus­lim na­tion, while muscling its way into the main­stream by lend­ing po­lit­i­cal sup­port to as­pir­ing of­fice-hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The FPI thrived un­der for­mer pres­i­dent Susilo Bam­bang Yud­hoy­ono, but Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo in 2017 warned that the au­thor­i­ties would “clob­ber” groups threat­en­ing In­done­sia’s plu­ral­ism and mod­er­ate Is­lam.</p>
    <p>At the time, hard­line groups in­clud­ing the FPI mo­bilised Mus­lims to rally against his ally, for­mer Jakarta gover­nor Ba­suki Tja­haja Pur­nama, a Chi­nese Chris­tian, over charges of blas­phemy against Is­lam. Mr Ba­suki, bet­ter known as Ahok, was jailed for two years.</p>
    <p>Mr Rizieq’s re­turn af­ter three years has raised con­cerns that he would again stoke divi­sion in In­done­sia’s mul­ti­cul­tural society and raise the po­lit­i­cal tem­per­a­ture just weeks ahead of the Dec 9 re­gional polls to elect gov­er­nors, re­gents and may­ors.</p>
    <p>But an­a­lysts say the huge turnouts who greeted the 55-year-old cleric at the air­port, and who at­tended his daugh­ter’s wed­ding and a re­li­gious event days later, posed lit­tle threat to sec­u­lar In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Since the 2016-2017 Is­lamist protests against Mr Ba­suki, Mr Joko, or Jokowi as he is widely called, has in­ten­si­fied com­mu­ni­ca­tion with Mus­lim lead­ers and em­braced his op­po­nents, in­clud­ing presidenti­al foe turned De­fence Min­is­ter Prabowo Su­bianto, who was seen as close to the FPI. Hence, a re­peat of un­rest on such a mega scale is un­likely, Para­mad­ina Univer­sity po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst Hen­dri Sa­trio told The Sun­day Times.</p>
    <p>“There’s lit­tle dan­ger as long as there con­tin­ues to be open com­mu­ni­ca­tion be­tween the govern­ment and FPI. It’s more dan­ger­ous to dis­band the FPI as it’s eas­ier for the govern­ment to con­trol a group that ex­ists than one that doesn’t,” he added.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Amin Ab­dul­lah, a pro­fes­sor of phi­los­o­phy at Su­nan Kal­i­jaga State Is­lamic Univer­sity, said Mr Rizieq and his fol­low­ers form a “tiny mi­nor­ity” in the coun­try of 270 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Even if the FPI wants to es­tab­lish it­self as a po­lit­i­cal party, it will be of lit­tle rel­e­vance to In­done­sians who have re­peat­edly proved at the bal­lot box that they are not too en­am­oured of Mus­lim par­ties.</p>
    <p>“The au­thor­i­ties will take ac­tion when vi­o­lence is in­volved. But if it’s just rhetoric on the podium, although cer­tainly an­noy­ing, it’s bet­ter to just let them be. Un­der In­done­sia’s sys­tem of democ­racy, we can’t sti­fle free­dom of ex­pres­sion and free­dom of as­so­ci­a­tion,” he added.</p>
    <p>In just a week, Mr Rizieq has been in­cit­ing the crowd with in­flam­ma­tory rhetoric. A video of his ser­mon has been mak­ing the rounds on so­cial me­dia urg­ing the govern­ment to be tough against blas­phe­mers, or “don’t blame the Mus­lims when a head is found on the streets”.</p>
    <p>Prom­i­nent Mus­lim scholar Azyu­mardi Azra said the FPI has “never been gen­uinely co­op­er­a­tive” with any In­done­sian ad­min­is­tra­tion, past or present.</p>
    <p>“He (Mr Rizieq) has stirred a lot of com­mo­tion, up­roar and po­lit­i­cal ten­sions in In­done­sia,” he told The Sun­day Times. “The govern­ment must stand firm and not fear Mus­lim back­lash as the main­stream Mus­lims will never side with or de­fend Rizieq if he’s ar­rested. It’s time for Pres­i­dent Jokowi to take ac­tion against Rizieq and the FPI.”</p>
