    <p>The Elec­tions Depart­ment (ELD) has filed a po­lice re­port against so­ciopo­lit­i­cal web­site New Naratif, say­ing it pub­lished unau­tho­rised paid ad­ver­tise­ments dur­ing the cam­paign pe­riod of the July Gen­eral Elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Its state­ment yes­ter­day said five such ads were pub­lished be­tween July 3 and 8.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Par­lia­men­tary Elec­tions Act, only elec­tion ad­ver­tis­ing that is done by or on be­half of a can­di­date is al­lowed.</p>
    <p>New Naratif al­legedly was not act­ing on be­half of any can­di­date when it pub­lished the ads on Face­book.</p>
    <p>The po­lice con­firmed yes­ter­day that the re­port was made and they are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>The cam­paign pe­riod for the 2020 Gen­eral Elec­tion was from June 30 to July 8.</p>
    <p>The ELD’s state­ment, which did not spec­ify when the po­lice re­port was made, said its as­sis­tant re­turn­ing of­fi­cer is­sued notices to Face­book on July 3, 7 and 8 to re­move the New Naratif ads pub­lished on the plat­form.</p>
    <p>The ELD said the ads amounted to elec­tion ac­tiv­ity, which the Act says is any ac­tiv­ity done to pro­mote or pro­cure elec­toral suc­cess at any elec­tion for one or more iden­ti­fi­able po­lit­i­cal par­ties, can­di­dates or groups of can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>It also in­cludes any ac­tiv­ity done to prej­u­dice the elec­toral prospects of other po­lit­i­cal par­ties, can­di­dates or groups of can­di­dates at the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>The ad­ver­tiser, there­fore, has to have a writ­ten doc­u­ment from the depart­ment to pub­lish the ad on be­half of the can­di­date. This doc­u­ment has to be signed by the can­di­date or elec­tion agent.</p>
    <p>The Act also states that ads can be con­sid­ered elec­tion ad­ver­tis­ing “even though it can rea­son­ably be re­garded as in­tended to achieve any other pur­pose as well and even though it does not ex­pressly men­tion the name of any po­lit­i­cal party or can­di­date”.</p>
    <p>The ELD said: “Nei­ther New Naratif nor its rep­re­sen­ta­tives or agents were au­tho­rised by any can­di­date or elec­tion agent in this gen­eral elec­tion to con­duct elec­tion ac­tiv­ity.”</p>
    <p>It said the first take­down no­tice to Face­book was is­sued on July 3, when the depart­ment also re­leased a me­dia state­ment say­ing New Naratif had been deemed to be con­duct­ing elec­tion ac­tiv­ity by plac­ing paid In­ter­net elec­tion ad­ver­tis­ing and that the so­ciopo­lit­i­cal web­site had not been au­tho­rised to do so.</p>
    <p>The public was also re­minded of the reg­u­la­tions, the ELD added.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, on July 4, New Naratif pub­li­cised the take­down de­ci­sion and con­tin­ued to pub­lish other paid ad­ver­tise­ments,” it said.</p>
    <p>On July 4, New Naratif said in a Face­book post that a “boosted post” it had paid for, fea­tur­ing a satir­i­cal video, had been re­moved af­ter the In­fo­comm Me­dia Devel­op­ment Au­thor­ity (IMDA) is­sued Face­book a no­tice.</p>
    <p>The video was a par­ody of a per­fume ad, fea­tur­ing clips of Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>Among other things, it ac­cused PM Lee of tar­get­ing his crit­ics un­der the guise of the rule of law.</p>
    <p>New Naratif said in its post: “The ar­gu­ment of this satir­i­cal video is that Sin­ga­porean laws are writ­ten so broadly as to ef­fec­tively make a huge swathe of le­git­i­mate po­lit­i­cal ac­tiv­ity il­le­gal with­out a per­mit, with the dis­cre­tion to take ac­tion in the hands of se­nior of­fi­cials and/or politi­cians.”</p>
    <p>It added: “By declar­ing this satir­i­cal ad­ver­tise­ment com­ment­ing on the rule of law in Sin­ga­pore to be elec­tion ad­ver­tis­ing, and order­ing the take­down, IMDA has demon­strated ex­actly the point of the video.”</p>
    <p>Any per­son con­victed of con­duct­ing unau­tho­rised elec­tion ac­tiv­ity can be fined up to $2,000, jailed for up to a year, or both.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times has con­tacted New Naratif for com­ment.</p>
