    <p>LON­DON­DERRY (New Hamp­shire) • Fresh from ac­cept­ing the Repub­li­can nom­i­na­tion, US Pres­i­dent Donald Trump had harsh words for anti-racism pro­test­ers dur­ing a cam­paign stop in the po­lit­i­cally im­por­tant state of New Hamp­shire.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing a crowd in an air­port hangar on Friday, he called the pro­test­ers who sought to dis­rupt his White House speech on Thurs­day night “thugs” and said Sen­a­tor Rand Paul could have died when he was swarmed by pro­test­ers after­wards.</p>
    <p>Mr Paul said on Friday that he was at­tacked by an “an­gry mob” of more than 100 peo­ple near the</p>
    <p>White House and had to be res­cued by the po­lice.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said of the Repub­li­can sen­a­tor: “He’d ei­ther be in very bad shape or dead, and that would in­clude his wife, if those po­lice­men didn’t hap­pen to be there.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has em­pha­sised a “law and or­der” theme to mo­ti­vate his po­lit­i­cal base and at­tract more vot­ers as he trails former vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den, the Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee, in na­tional polls ahead of the Nov 3 elec­tion.</p>
    <p>“You know what I say? Pro­test­ers, your ass. I don’t talk about my ass,” he said. “They’re not pro­test­ers. Those aren’t pro­test­ers. Those are an­ar­chists, they’re ag­i­ta­tors, they’re ri­ot­ers, they’re loot­ers.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has been crit­i­cised for not show­ing em­pa­thy in the wake of shoot­ings and killings of black men by po­lice, in­clud­ing Mr Ge­orge Floyd, who died in po­lice cus­tody in Min­neapo­lis in May, spark­ing an­tiracism demon­stra­tions world­wide.</p>
    <p>New protests erupted in Kenosha, Wis­con­sin, this week af­ter po­lice of­fi­cers shot Mr Ja­cob Blake, an­other black man, mul­ti­ple times in front of his chil­dren. He sur­vived.</p>
    <p>Thou­sands of peo­ple took part in a march in Wash­ing­ton on Friday to de­nounce racism.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has not com­mented ex­ten­sively about Mr Blake, but he spoke ex­ten­sively about pro­test­ers on Friday with­out spec­i­fy­ing which demon­stra­tion he was talk­ing about.</p>
    <p>“They’re just look­ing for trou­ble. This has noth­ing to do with Ge­orge Floyd, has noth­ing to do with any­thing. They don’t even know who Ge­orge Floyd is,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den and his run­ning mate, vice-pres­i­den­tial nom­i­nee Sen­a­tor Ka­mala Har­ris, said Mr Trump was mak­ing Amer­ica less safe with his rhetoric and his han­dling of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent in­cites vi­o­lence, in­spires white-su­prem­a­cist shoot­ers, and his failed Covid re­sponse is cost­ing thou­sands of lives per day. When you look at the world right now, ask your­self: Do you feel safe in Trump’s Amer­ica?” Mr Bi­den tweeted.</p>
    <p>Ms Har­ris said at a fund-raiser: “He (Trump) has been ob­sessed, I think, with spread­ing fear and us­ing di­vi­sion to pro­tect his own ego, and more fun­da­men­tally to erode the foun­da­tions of the democ­racy that he swore to de­fend.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, whose speech to the</p>
    <p>Repub­li­can Na­tional Con­ven­tion was low key com­pared with his rally ap­pear­ances, seemed to find his foot­ing in New Hamp­shire, a state he lost nar­rowly to Demo­cratic can­di­date Hil­lary Clin­ton in 2016 and where he is trail­ing Mr Bi­den this year.</p>
    <p>He went over some of his favourite themes, in­clud­ing his in­sis­tence that Mex­ico would pay for a wall along the US border and that Democrats would try to slash fund­ing for law en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den has re­jected calls from the left to “de­fund” the po­lice, but Mr Trump has er­ro­neously sug­gested that it is a pol­icy Mr Bi­den would em­brace.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has crit­i­cised Mr Bi­den for cam­paign­ing mostly from his Delaware home be­cause of the pan­demic, in­tends to travel ex­ten­sively in the com­ing months to boost his mo­men­tum. He has not been able to hold his sig­na­ture large ral­lies due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>A June rally at an in­door arena in Tulsa, Ok­la­homa, at­tracted a crowd that was well below ca­pac­ity. The area ex­pe­ri­enced an uptick in coro­n­avirus cases for weeks af­ter the event. And last month, Mr Trump had to can­cel a rally in New Hamp­shire over con­cerns about a trop­i­cal storm off the East Coast.</p>
