    <p>The white-throated king­fisher (above) is one of the most com­mon king­fish­ers in Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>This one was pho­tographed perched on a lamp post in Dempsey Road last week.</p>
    <p>The species, which is also known as Hal­cyon smyr­nen­sis, gets its name from the ob­vi­ous white patch on its throat that can ex­tend down to its breast.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Na­tional Parks Board, it is highly adapt­able and can be spot­ted along the fringes of reser­voirs and in open fields.</p>
    <p>It is known to be one of the big­ger king­fisher species that can be found in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Other than fish, it also preys on large in­sects and small an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>Those look­ing af­ter the vul­ner­a­ble, es­pe­cially the el­derly, re­ceived a boost amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic in the form of more than $5 mil­lion in do­na­tions, in­clud­ing more than $2 mil­lion in cash.</p>
    <p>The Agency for In­te­grated Care (AIC) said the do­na­tions will help arm the com­mu­nity care sec­tor in its fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the or­gan­i­sa­tion said com­mu­nity care providers have been step­ping up in­fec­tion con­trol and pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures, as well as im­ple­ment­ing new ways to de­liver care more safely.</p>
    <p>But these ef­forts cost money. “The sup­port from the spon­sors serves to not only en­hance our part­ners’ on­go­ing ef­forts, but is also a boost to our morale, know­ing that the larger com­mu­nity is with us in this fight,” said AIC chief ex­ec­u­tive Tan Kwang Cheak.</p>
    <p>The do­na­tions will go to­wards sup­port­ing com­mu­nity care providers – such as nurs­ing homes and or­gan­i­sa­tions like Ang Mo KioThye Hua Kwan Hos­pi­tal – in three ways.</p>
    <p>Com­mu­nity care providers can tap the re­sources to dig­i­talise for ser­vice con­ti­nu­ity; show ap­pre­ci­a­tion for their health­care staff; and off­set the costs of tak­ing pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures to clean their premises.</p>
    <p>AIC said the do­na­tions were from more than 20 or­gan­i­sa­tions and in­di­vid­u­als, in­clud­ing Te­masek Foun­da­tion, Sin­ga­pore Pools and Busi­ness China, a non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion that seeks to strengthen ties be­tween Sin­ga­pore and China.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness China CEO Tin Pei Ling said the or­gan­i­sa­tion had ral­lied its net­work of prom­i­nent Chi­nese busi­ness lead­ers “to show their sol­i­dar­ity with Sin­ga­pore by con­tribut­ing to AIC’s ef­fort in sup­port­ing our el­der­care sec­tor”.</p>
    <p>“Our se­niors are the most vul­ner­a­ble in this pan­demic and we must do our best to pro­tect them,” added Ms Tin, who is MP for MacPher­son.</p>
    <p>One of the ben­e­fi­cia­ries of these do­na­tions is All Saints Home, a nurs­ing home in Hougang.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a health­care as­sis­tant there tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, the home en­gaged a pro­fes­sional clean­ing com­pany to dis­in­fect its premises mul­ti­ple times as a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure.</p>
    <p>Funds re­ceived by AIC helped the home de­fray these costs.</p>
    <p>The home also boosted t he morale of its care staff by giv­ing them care pack­ages that in­cluded vi­ta­mins and hand sani­tiser.</p>
    <p>“We would like to en­cour­age like­minded in­di­vid­u­als and cor­po­rates to come on board and join their peers in sup­port­ing the com­mu­nity care providers’ on­go­ing ef­forts to pro­vide bet­ter and safer care for se­niors,” Mr Tan added.</p>
    <p>MORALE BOOST The sup­port from the spon­sors serves to not only en­hance our part­ners’ on­go­ing ef­forts, but is also a boost to our morale, know­ing that the larger com­mu­nity is with ’’ us in this fight. MR TAN KWANG CHEAK, chief ex­ec­u­tive of Agency for In­te­grated Care, on how the do­na­tions re­ceived will help com­mu­nity care providers fight the out­break.</p>
