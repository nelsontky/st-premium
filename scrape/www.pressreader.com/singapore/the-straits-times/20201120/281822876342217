    <p>BER­LIN • The num­ber of new Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Ger­many is still far too high but there are signs that social dis­tanc­ing mea­sures are work­ing, health of­fi­cials said, a day af­ter pro­test­ers clashed with the po­lice in cen­tral Ber­lin over gov­ern­ment mea­sures to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>The head of the Robert Koch In­sti­tute (RKI) for in­fec­tious dis­eases, Pro­fes­sor Lothar Wieler, said yesterday he was op­ti­mistic the pos­i­tive trend of case num­bers sta­bil­is­ing would con­tinue, though it is un­clear how long mea­sures to slow the pandemic will have to re­main in place.</p>
    <p>The head of RKI’s sur­veil­lance unit, Dr Ute Rexroth, added that there are in­di­ca­tions that Ger­many’s re­stric­tions are work­ing, as the num­ber of new in­fec­tions has sta­bilised.</p>
    <p>Con­firmed coro­n­avirus cases in the coun­try rose by 22,609 to 855,916, the big­gest in­crease in six days, RKI data showed yesterday, while the death toll rose by 251 to 13,370.</p>
    <p>Ger­many im­posed a month-long “lock­down light” on Nov 2 to rein in a sec­ond wave that is sweep­ing much of Europe.</p>
    <p>Two weeks into the par­tial shut­down – which closed bars and restau­rants but kept schools and most shops open – the coun­try’s con­ta­gion rates are still nearly triple the level the au­thor­i­ties have de­ter­mined to be man­age­able, rais­ing the prospect of tougher curbs over­shad­ow­ing Christ­mas and New Year fes­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>On Wed­nes­day, the po­lice un­leashed wa­ter can­non and pep­per spray in Ber­lin to dis­perse thou­sands of pro­test­ers an­gry over the re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>At least 365 ar­rests were made and 10 po­lice of­fi­cers in­jured as around 5,000 ac­tivists gath­ered at the city’s Bran­den­burg Gate, af­ter the gov­ern­ment banned ral­lies out­side Par­lia­ment due to fears of vi­o­lence.</p>
    <p>Af­ter re­peated warn­ings for the crowd to put on face cov­er­ings went un­heeded, the po­lice spent sev­eral hours try­ing to break up the demon­stra­tion.</p>
    <p>Pro­test­ers threw bot­tles, stones and fire­works at of­fi­cers and at­tacked them with pep­per spray, the po­lice said, prompt­ing them to “use phys­i­cal force and pep­per spray and ar­rest some of the at­tack­ers”.</p>
    <p>The demon­stra­tion mir­rored sim­i­lar protests seen across Europe against re­stric­tions which op­po­nents see as a vi­o­la­tion of their civil rights, de­spite gov­ern­ment warn­ings about the need to stop the spread of in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>“We don’t need emer­gency mea­sures,” said Mr Achim Ecker, a demon­stra­tor in his 50s who trav­elled to Ber­lin from neigh­bour­ing Bran­den­burg state. “I be­lieve in our own im­mune sys­tems.”</p>
