    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • There were plenty of pos­i­tives as the Bos­ton Celtics drew first blood in Game 1 of the first round of their Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) play-offs against the Philadel­phia 76ers, the league’s old­est ri­valry.</p>
    <p>Not only did they beat the Six­ers 109-101, they showed the fu­ture was bright on Mon­day, with Jayson Ta­tum and Jaylen Brown be­com­ing the first Bos­ton play­ers aged 23 or younger to score 25 or more points in the same play-off game.</p>
    <p>All-Star for­ward Ta­tum led all scor­ers with 32 points, while guard Brown added 29 to over­come a more ex­pe­ri­enced Six­ers team that missed All-Star Ben Sim­mons, who has been ruled out after un­der­go­ing sea­son-ending knee surgery.</p>
    <p>His ab­sence could swing the se­ries in favour of the Celtics, who lost three of their four reg­u­lar-sea­son match-ups, with the Aus­tralian guard prov­ing to be their best de­fen­sive as­set against Bos­ton’s perime­ter threats.</p>
    <p>With­out him, Ta­tum, who was pre­vi­ously re­stricted to 28 per cent ef­fec­tive field-goal per­cent­age, was able to drive to the rim re­peat­edly, lead­ing Bos­ton coach Brad Stevens to hail his bat­tling dis­play.</p>
    <p>“Yeah, he was re­ally good,” he told ESPN. “I thought he was un­be­liev­able de­fen­sively the whole game, talk­ing and help­ing, and com­mu­ni­cat­ing and read­ing, and he just makes a bunch of – he makes a huge im­pact on that end.</p>
    <p>“Then, of­fen­sively, it doesn’t feel like he got 32 at the end of the night. He just plays the game within him­self and finds the next right play. He did a lot of good things tonight.”</p>
    <p>The vic­tory, how­ever, came at a cost as they lost Gor­don Hay­ward, who had 12 points be­fore his night ended early, to an an­kle in­jury.</p>
    <p>The All-Star for­ward has been blighted by prob­lems since join­ing the Celtics in 2017, suf­fer­ing a bro­ken an­kle on his de­but and sub­se­quently miss­ing the rest of that sea­son.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this term, he frac­tured his hand and the 30-year-old could be a doubt for the rest of their se­ries after leav­ing Dis­ney World in a pro­tec­tive boot.</p>
    <p>Stevens said: “Sprained an­kle. Don’t know the sever­ity, but he’s clearly in pain, and it looked like it had some swelling al­ready. That’s my med­i­cal re­view.”</p>
    <p>Sim­mons, how­ever, is a big­ger loss to the Six­ers than Hay­ward is to the Celtics, and three-time Al­lS­tar Joel Em­biid ad­mit­ted he would have to do more ahead of Game 2 to­day, par­tic­u­larly as his team are de­pend­ing on him to pick up the scor­ing slack.</p>
    <p>The Cameroo­nian cen­tre paced Philadel­phia with 26 points and had 16 boards, but he con­ceded it was “ob­vi­ously not enough”.</p>
    <p>“I’ve got to be more ag­gres­sive. Maybe we need to call some more plays but I don’t know,” Em­biid said. “That’s an­other thing we’ve got to fix go­ing into Game 2.”</p>
