    <p>SEOUL • South Korea’s mil­i­tary has taken into cus­tody a North Korean man who crossed the heav­ily for­ti­fied bor­der with North Korea in a po­ten­tial de­fec­tion to the South, prompt­ing an ur­gent search op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The man was found at about 9.50am lo­cal time on the east­ern end of the demil­i­tarised zone (DMZ) di­vid­ing the two Koreas, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said yes­ter­day, adding that there was no un­usual move­ment among North Korean troops.</p>
    <p>“An in­ves­ti­ga­tion is planned to find out details about the man, in­clud­ing how he had come down and whether he wished to de­fect,” the JCS said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>The per­son was first spot­ted cross­ing barbed wire fences in­stalled along the bor­der at 7.26pm on Tues­day, the News1 agency re­ported, cit­ing an un­named mil­i­tary source.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s Yon­hap News Agency said that the mil­i­tary had is­sued a “Jin­dot­gae” anti-in­fil­tra­tion alert for the east­ern bor­der area, and that the man had ex­pressed a will­ing­ness to de­fect.</p>
    <p>The De­fence Min­istry de­clined to con­firm those re­ports, cit­ing an on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tion came as South Korea yes­ter­day restarted tours to the south­ern part of the DMZ, which had seen sev­eral armed clashes, but also served as a venue for key in­ter-Korea events, in­clud­ing some of the most re­cent sum­mits.</p>
    <p>But the pro­gramme was suspended in Oc­to­ber last year after an out­break of deadly African swine fever in North Korea, and then owing to con­cerns about the coro­n­avirus pan­demic this year.</p>
    <p>Uni­fi­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lee Iny­oung, cel­e­brat­ing the re­sump­tion of tours, made no men­tion of the North Korean man, but called for free travel among all Kore­ans within the DMZ and a re­cov­ery of in­ter-Korea hot­lines sev­ered amid strained ties.</p>
    <p>“Re-es­tab­lish­ing round-the­clock com­mu­ni­ca­tion chan­nels would be a ba­sis for restor­ing in­ter-Korean re­la­tions,” Mr Lee, who over­sees cross-bor­der af­fairs, told a cer­e­mony at the truce vil­lage of Pan­munjom within the DMZ.</p>
    <p>The lat­est case marked the first bor­der cross­ing since a North Korean soldier de­fected to the South via the cen­tral DMZ in July last year.</p>
    <p>In late 2018, another North Korean soldier de­fected via the east­ern DMZ.</p>
    <p>In a more dra­matic es­cape to the South in 2017, North Korean troops fired at a soldier when he drove an army truck through Pan­munjom.</p>
    <p>In­ter-Korea re­la­tions soured as de­nu­cle­ari­sa­tion talks be­tween Py­ongyang and Wash­ing­ton stalled last year. In Septem­ber, North Korean troops shot dead a South Korean fish­eries of­fi­cial who went miss­ing at sea, spark­ing furore in the South.</p>
