    <p>As Septem­ber rolled in, Mr Kam­lesh Gadage vis­ited the hos­pi­tal for the 10th time in eight months.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old veg­etable seller from Pune suf­fers from liver cir­rho­sis and had reg­is­tered for a liver trans­plant last De­cem­ber. “I am fifth on the wait­ing list, but due to Covid-19, my wait is ex­tend­ing for­ever. I have a lot of pain and visit the hos­pi­tal ev­ery 15 to 20 days,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic and the na­tion­wide lock­down have stopped nearly all or­gan do­na­tions in In­dia.</p>
    <p>So­cial dis­tanc­ing rules im­posed on March 25, wide­spread fear of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions, and a vir­tual sus­pen­sion of non-Covid-19 treat­ments in spe­cial­ity hospi­tals have left thou­sands of pa­tients in need of liver, kid­ney, lung and heart trans­plants un­cer­tain about their fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Dr R. Kan­thi­mathi, who heads the trans­plant author­ity in Tamil Nadu, the state with one of the largest num­bers of or­gan do­na­tions in In­dia, said: “Or­gan do­na­tions have fallen be­cause of the re­duced traf­fic ac­ci­dents un­der the lock­down.”</p>
    <p>Hearts and lungs are har­vested from dead donors – ac­ci­dent vic­tims who be­come brain dead. Liv­ers and kid­neys come usu­ally from live donors, of­ten rel­a­tives.</p>
    <p>Dr Aabha Na­gral, Mr Gadage’s physi­cian and a trustee at Mum­bai’s Chil­dren’s Liver Foun­da­tion, said: “Doc­tors and in­ten­sivists have been over­worked and stressed for months with Covid-19 pa­tients. Or­gan do­na­tions may not</p>
    <p>be their high­est pri­or­ity. There’s a short­age of ven­ti­la­tors and in­ten­sive care units too.”</p>
    <p>Amid the pan­demic, the num­ber of or­gan do­na­tions has fallen glob­ally. In­dia sees 0.65 or­gan do­na­tion per mil­lion pop­u­la­tion, com­pared with 49 per mil­lion in Spain and 36 per mil­lion in the United States last year, and 6.6 per mil­lion in Sin­ga­pore in 2017.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has fur­ther skewed that ra­tio. Tamil Nadu, for in­stance, had 15 heart, 17 lung, 34 liver and 69 kid­ney trans­plants from Jan­uary to March. The state did not see any dead donors dur­ing its lock­down, with donors re­turn­ing only when re­stric­tions were eased in July.</p>
    <p>Physi­cians have had to weigh the ben­e­fits of life-sav­ing surgery with the risk of ex­pos­ing their al­ready</p>
    <p>frag­ile pa­tients with heart or lung fail­ure to the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“There is a high chance of trans­mis­sion of in­fec­tion from the donor, doc­tors, ward boys, am­bu­lance driv­ers to the im­mune-com­pro­mised re­cip­i­ent, so there are medico-le­gal is­sues,” said Dr San­jeev Jad­hav, di­rec­tor of heart and lung trans­plants at Mum­bai’s Apollo Hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>As at Sept 8 in Tamil Nadu, there were 47 peo­ple wait­ing for a heart trans­plant, 27 for lung trans­plant, 474 for liver trans­plant and 5,789 for kid­ney trans­plant. In Ma­ha­rash­tra, as at Aug 29, there were 74 on the heart wait­ing list, 16 for lung trans­plant, 1,100 for liver trans­plant and 5,500 for kid­ney trans­plant.</p>
    <p>Dr Vas­an­thi Ramesh, di­rec­tor of the National Or­gan and Tis­sue Trans­plant Or­gan­i­sa­tion (Notto), which is build­ing a national registry of or­gans, said: “For­tu­nately, af­ter a near-to­tal stop to or­gan do­na­tions dur­ing the lock­down, num­bers have been go­ing up to sin­gle dig­its per month since July, as In­dia be­gan to un­lock its econ­omy in phases.”</p>
    <p>To min­imise the risk of in­fec­tion, some state gov­ern­ments have now de­vised stan­dard op­er­at­ing pro­ce­dures. Tamil Nadu tests the donor, the re­cip­i­ent and also the re­cip­i­ent’s close fam­ily mem­bers, for Covid-19. In Ma­ha­rash­tra, pa­tients and health­care work­ers are tested and mon­i­tored for a month be­fore and af­ter the trans­plant surgery.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a new group has en­tered the wait­ing list for lung and heart trans­plants: Covid-19 sur­vivors. On Aug 29, doc­tors in Chen­nai per­formed a lung trans­plant on a 48-year-old Covid-19 sur­vivor, and on Sept 11, a hos­pi­tal in Chandi­garh trans­planted lungs into a 32-year-old pa­tient.</p>
    <p>With In­dia see­ing over 5.2 mil­lion Covid-19 cases, Notto’s Dr Ramesh is wor­ried that there “may be a greater need for lungs and hearts in the fu­ture due to fi­bro­sis in coro­n­avirus-af­fected lungs. In that case, we should raise aware­ness about more or­gan do­na­tion now”.</p>
    <p>But Dr Paul Ramesh, a car­dio­tho­racic, heart and lung trans­plant sur­geon at Chen­nai’s Apollo Hos­pi­tal, was scep­ti­cal about trans­plan­ta­tion as a so­lu­tion for Covid-19 sur­vivors. “The success of a lung trans­plant is mea­sured ini­tially at 30 days af­ter surgery, then af­ter one year. This is an un­known data point in Covid-19 pa­tients any­where in the world.”</p>
