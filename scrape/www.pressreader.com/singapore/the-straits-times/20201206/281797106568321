    <p>WILM­ING­TON (Delaware) • Set­ting a sharp con­trast with Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump, whose ad­min­is­tra­tion be­gan with a fight over the size of his in­au­gu­ral crowds, Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den has said he plans a scaled-back event for safety’s sake dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Demo­cratic for­mer vi­cepres­i­dent said he does ex­pect to be sworn in on Jan 20 on the plat­form al­ready be­ing con­structed on the steps of the US Capi­tol, but wanted to avoid the crowds that typ­i­cally gather on the Na­tional Mall and along Penn­syl­va­nia Av­enue to view the cer­e­mony and pa­rade.</p>
    <p>“My guess is there prob­a­bly will not be a gi­gan­tic in­au­gu­ral pa­rade down Penn­syl­va­nia Av­enue.</p>
    <p>“But my guess is you’ll see a lot of vir­tual ac­tiv­ity in states all across Amer­ica, en­gag­ing even more peo­ple than be­fore,” Mr Bi­den said in his home­town of Wilm­ing­ton, Delaware, where he is pre­par­ing his new ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion mem­o­rably be­gan in January 2017 with his then spokesman Sean Spicer be­rat­ing the news me­dia for pub­lish­ing photos that showed far smaller crowds than had gath­ered for Mr Barack Obama’s his­toric swearingin as the na­tion’s first black pres­i­dent eight years ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said his team is work­ing with the same mem­bers who pro­duced Au­gust’s largely on­line Demo­cratic Na­tional Con­ven­tion to plan a swear­ing-in that did not raise the risks of ac­cel­er­at­ing the spread of Covid-19, which has surged to an­other record high in the United States.</p>
    <p>The cer­e­mony typ­i­cally be­gins with the out­go­ing pres­i­dent and the pres­i­dent-elect rid­ing to­gether from the White House to the Capi­tol. Af­ter the new pres­i­dent is sworn in, he rides back along Penn­syl­va­nia Av­enue to as­sume his new du­ties while the for­mer pres­i­dent de­parts, typ­i­cally by he­li­copter.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has re­fused to con­cede the elec­tion, has not said if he will at­tend the cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>In­stead, ac­cord­ing to a source in the know, he is con­sid­er­ing launch­ing his bid to run again in 2024 that day.</p>
