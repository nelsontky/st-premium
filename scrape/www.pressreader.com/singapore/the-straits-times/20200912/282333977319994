    <p>It is heart­en­ing to see that new guide­lines to stamp out er­rant pric­ing prac­tices by busi­nesses will kick in soon (Guide­lines on pric­ing prac­tices to kick in on Nov 1).</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic of­ten face un­fair prac­tices such as fake dis­counts, drip pric­ing and mis­lead­ing com­par­isons, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>It is also com­mon to have such un­fair en­coun­ters as we carry out our daily rou­tines. Just take the su­per­mar­ket. Many items are of­ten listed as be­ing on of­fer. The items are never priced at their nor­mal prices.</p>
    <p>I bought a tub of mar­garine which has had the same dis­counted price for the past three years. I have never seen the item sold at a nor­mal price.</p>
    <p>Some heart­land re­tail­ers have ban­ners scream­ing “clos­ing down sale”. Yet, they are still around a cou­ple of years later.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers are will­ing to pay a good price for a solid prod­uct. They also ex­pect a good dis­count as promised and will be put off by any in­flated pric­ing.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses should be con­ducted eth­i­cally, they should not be ven­tures aimed at fleec­ing oth­ers.</p>
