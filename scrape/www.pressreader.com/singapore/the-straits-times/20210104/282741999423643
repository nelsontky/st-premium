    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • In the mu­sic video for his song Any­one, Justin Bieber ap­pears to have turned back time a decade – at least when it comes to his skin.</p>
    <p>The heav­ily tat­tooed singer showed off his un­adorned body in the mu­sic video, in which he played a boxer-in-train­ing with ac­tress Zoey Deutch as his love in­ter­est.</p>
    <p>The song was re­leased at the stroke of mid­night on Jan 1 as the clos­ing num­ber of his New Year’s Eve con­cert, which was livestream­ed from The Bev­erly Hil­ton ho­tel in Los An­ge­les to mil­lions across the globe.</p>
    <p>Bieber later posted a re­veal­ing be­hind-the-scenes time lapse on In­sta­gram, clad i n noth­ing but white Calvin Klein briefs.</p>
    <p>In the clip, a team of make-up artists worked their magic on his torso, arms and legs, mirac­u­lously mak­ing all his tat­toos dis­ap­pear.</p>
    <p>“No tats for the #Any­onev­ideo,” Bieber wrote in the cap­tion.</p>
    <p>Fans mar­velled at the trans­for­ma­tion, with one say­ing: “It is like 2010.” An­other added: “Feels so weird to see you without tat­toos.”</p>
    <p>Bieber has spo­ken in the past of the sig­nif­i­cance of the in­tri­cate art­work on his body, which in­cludes a lion with a crown, a bear, a skele­ton and an ea­gle tak­ing flight.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber last year, he showed off a rose neck-piece, say­ing: “I think the thorns sym­bol­ise the rough spots in my life. The flower is such a rep­re­sen­ta­tion of beauty.”</p>
    <p>How­ever, Bieber said his wife Hai­ley Bald­win has put a stop to more tat­toos, at least on the neck. He said: “I think I’m done on my neck. That’s a Hai­ley re­quest.”</p>
