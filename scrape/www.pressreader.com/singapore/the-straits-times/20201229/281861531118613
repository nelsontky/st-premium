    <p>LONDON • “What we call the be­gin­ning is of­ten the end. And to make an end is to make a be­gin­ning.”</p>
    <p>When Ur­sula von der Leyen, the pres­i­dent of the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, re­cited these words by the Bri­tish poet T. S. Eliot at a press con­fer­ence in Brus­sels on Christ­mas Eve, she en­cap­su­lated in one sen­tence the essence of the his­tor­i­cal moment over which she was pre­sid­ing.</p>
    <p>The Union she rep­re­sents had just con­cluded a treaty with Bri­tain, gov­ern­ing their re­la­tion­ship for decades to come. This treaty be­came es­sen­tial as a re­sult of Bri­tain’s de­ci­sion to leave the EU. In that re­spect, there­fore, it rep­re­sents the end of a re­la­tion­ship. But it also stands for the be­gin­ning of a new, if very dif­fer­ent re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain and the Euro­pean Union are now fac­ing a new his­tor­i­cal junc­ture, and nei­ther side can map their fu­ture tra­jec­tory. How­ever, one con­clu­sion is in­evitable: the link be­tween the two will re­main much more im­por­tant than ei­ther side is now will­ing to ad­mit.</p>
    <p>Rather like a mar­riage doomed from the start, Bri­tain’s as­so­ci­a­tion with the EU be­gan in 1973 based on en­thu­si­as­tic vows and hope­ful prom­ises.</p>
    <p>But it quickly de­scended into decades of mis­trust, pe­ri­odic at­tempts at rec­on­cil­i­a­tion, all of which failed, fol­lowed by name-call­ing, open hos­til­ity and the in­evitable last-minute undig­ni­fied scrap about shar­ing the bro­ken house­hold’s worth­less trin­kets.</p>
    <p>Mer­ci­fully, this un­happy mar­riage was child­less, a re­lief shared by both es­tranged part­ners. So, al­though the sep­a­ra­tion was trau­matic, it also now ap­pears rea­son­ably clean-cut.</p>
    <p>MYTHS ABOUT THE BREAK-UP</p>
    <p>Books the length of en­cy­clopae­dias have been writ­ten about the rea­sons for this fun­da­men­tal break­down in re­la­tions. The ar­gu­ments are com­plex, but most of them need not de­tain us here. Still, no ac­cu­rate pre­dic­tion about Bri­tain’s fu­ture and the EU’s re­la­tion­ship is pos­si­ble with­out dis­miss­ing the myths which have emerged.</p>
    <p>One com­mon ex­pla­na­tion – be­lieved by many out­side the UK – is that the Bri­tish have sim­ply never got over the loss of their em­pire; leav­ing the EU is, al­legedly, the last gasp of their old im­pe­rial dream, a return to their old, sup­posed glo­ries.</p>
    <p>Ut­ter non­sense. Bri­tons in­deed spent much of the 1950s and 1960s try­ing to avoid mem­ber­ship in the Com­mon Market – as the EU was then called – pri­mar­ily be­cause they be­lieved that the Euro­pean project was be­neath them.</p>
    <p>But it is equally valid that by the time Bri­tain joined Europe, few of its peo­ple be­lieved in re­viv­ing the em­pire’s glo­ries. In­deed, Bri­tain joined the EU pre­cisely be­cause all its other op­tions had failed. One of the first man­i­fes­ta­tions of this was the with­drawal of Bri­tish troops from Asia, even if this en­tailed break­ing solemn de­fence prom­ises made to coun­tries such as Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>By now, it is largely for­got­ten that, when the Bri­tish voted back in 1975 in the first ref­er­en­dum on whether to re­main in the EU, the over­whelm­ing sup­port for Europe came from older peo­ple, pre­cisely those who did re­mem­ber the em­pire. To sug­gest that, some­how, old im­pe­rial dreams have come back to haunt to­day’s gen­er­a­tions like some Franken­stein mon­ster is to en­gage in fan­tasy.</p>
    <p>The truth re­mains that the bulk of those who voted to leave the EU are the low­est-ed­u­cated in the pop­u­la­tion, pre­cisely the sort of peo­ple who were the can­non fod­der of the old em­pire. They have noth­ing to gain from il­lu­sions of Bri­tish grandeur and prob­a­bly are not even aware of this his­tory. They voted to leave mainly be­cause they feared com­pe­ti­tion from un­con­trolled im­mi­gra­tion, a re­sult of the EU’s open bor­der poli­cies, not be­cause they dreamt of re­turn­ing to sip­ping pink gins on a colo­nial ve­randa in Delhi.</p>
    <p>An­other myth, con­ve­niently put about by those who hate Brexit, sug­gests that the en­tire Bri­tish pub­lic was hi­jacked by pop­ulist politi­cians who hood­winked them into vot­ing to leave.</p>
    <p>Yet again, un­true. The Bri­tish</p>
    <p>So­cial At­ti­tudes, an an­nual au­thor­i­ta­tive sur­vey of what the Bri­tish think about most top­i­cal sub­jects, has recorded a rise in anti-EU feel­ings for decades. Back in 1992, only 10 per cent of the Bri­tish pub­lic wanted to leave the EU. By the year 2000, that fig­ure rose to 17 per cent, in 2012, it stood at 30 per cent, and in 2016, when the ref­er­en­dum on this topic was held, it reached 41 per cent.</p>
    <p>True, pop­ulist politi­cians with catchy slo­gans and empty prom­ises en­sured that the “Leave” camp tri­umphed in 2016. But they only needed to per­suade a rel­a­tively small num­ber of peo­ple, for the ground was al­ready laid for such a de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Yes, then Prime Min­is­ter David Cameron could have avoided hold­ing the ref­er­en­dum. And, yes, Mr Cameron was naive to as­sume that he could win a de­bate which, by then, was not about facts but emo­tions. Be that as it may, it is in­con­testable that pop­ulist politi­cians were not the rea­son Bri­tain is now out­side the EU; in­stead, they are the prod­uct of a pop­u­lar move­ment which, for a va­ri­ety of rea­sons, had been brew­ing for decades.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lish­ing these facts now is es­sen­tial be­cause these set the pa­ram­e­ters of a more plau­si­ble sce­nario of what may be in store.</p>
    <p>ODDS OF A RETURN</p>
    <p>First, al­though there is anec­do­tal ev­i­dence that, if a fresh ref­er­en­dum was held to­day, the de­ci­sion to leave the EU might be re­versed, the chances of this hap­pen­ing are pre­cisely zero. No se­ri­ous Bri­tish political party will dare raise this ques­tion for at least a decade from now.</p>
    <p>And even if the ques­tion were to be raised, it is not ev­i­dent that the an­swer would be a return to the EU, if only be­cause the bloc it­self is chang­ing in ways which most or­di­nary Brits would find un­ac­cept­able.</p>
    <p>Just imag­ine Bri­tain was in the EU this year when the Union not only de­cided to bor­row vast quan­ti­ties of money to help its weak­est mem­bers dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic but also agreed to wait on the dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines un­til ev­ery EU mem­ber state had got its fair share.</p>
    <p>There is not the slight­est doubt that the Brits would have re­fused to go along with both ini­tia­tives. Nor is there much doubt that the EU will be tight­en­ing in­ter­nal co­op­er­a­tion even fur­ther in the years to come.</p>
    <p>So, even if pub­lic opin­ion in Bri­tain were to shift in favour of Europe, the thresh­old re­quired for join­ing the EU would get much steeper, and prob­a­bly well beyond what or­di­nary Brits are pre­pared to stom­ach. So, an ex­is­tence out­side the EU looks like the most plau­si­ble sce­nario for at least a gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>SCOT­TISH SPLIT?</p>
    <p>But ev­ery­thing beyond that gets much more un­pre­dictable.</p>
    <p>The big­gest ques­tion is whether the trauma of the past five years could her­ald the break-up of the United King­dom it­self.</p>
    <p>Scot­tish na­tion­al­ists are sure to win a ma­jor­ity in the elec­tions in their part of the coun­try in May. The de­mand for an­other ref­er­en­dum on in­de­pen­dence can­not be de­nied for much longer.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the con­nec­tions be­tween North­ern Ire­land and the Repub­lic of Ire­land, an EU mem­ber, are likely to grow as, un­der the with­drawal agree­ment, North­ern Ire­land will fol­low some sin­gle market rules to en­sure its bor­der with the lat­ter stays open.</p>
    <p>It is pre­ma­ture to pre­dict the UK’s break-up, if only be­cause those ar­gu­ing for Scot­tish in­de­pen­dence will have to ex­plain why leav­ing the UK – Scot­land’s big­gest market – is some­how the pre­ferred an­swer to the UK leav­ing the EU. And it is usu­ally for­got­ten that, while Scot­tish na­tion­al­ists like to claim that they are ar­dent Euro­peans, they refuse to ac­cept the euro as their fu­ture cur­rency, pri­mar­ily be­cause they know that this will cost Scot­land dear.</p>
    <p>In short, the ar­gu­ment for Scot­land re­main­ing in­side the UK may still be won. But un­til this is done – which is a mat­ter of a few years – politi­cians in London will re­main very touchy about their coun­try’s in­ter­ac­tions with</p>
    <p>Europe at ev­ery level.</p>
    <p>And then, there is trade. Ever the PR sales­man, Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son claims that the treaty with the EU set­tles out­stand­ing mat­ters, al­low­ing for free trade be­tween his coun­try and the rest of the con­ti­nent.</p>
    <p>MORE DIS­PUTES AHEAD</p>
    <p>But that is a pipe dream. To start with, al­though the treaty cov­ers trade in man­u­fac­tured goods, it says next to noth­ing about trade in ser­vices which ac­count for the bulk of Bri­tain’s ex­ports. Nor does the cur­rent treaty say any­thing about the fate of the City of London, Europe’s big­gest fi­nan­cial cen­tre, which re­mains ut­terly de­pen­dent on Europe for its con­tin­ued pros­per­ity.</p>
    <p>Fur­ther­more, al­though the Bri­tish have won the right to fix their own trade rules with the world, it is non­sense to sug­gest that this free­dom comes at no cost.</p>
    <p>In con­clud­ing the cur­rent treaty with the EU, the Bri­tish failed to con­vince the Euro­peans to re­duce the fre­quency of bor­der checks on food prod­ucts, or to en­sure that Bri­tish pro­fes­sional qual­i­fi­ca­tions – such as those of lawyers and ac­coun­tants – would be recog­nised across the con­ti­nent. So, the Bri­tish have the free­dom to do as they please on global trade, but only at the cost of fu­ture trade dis­putes with the EU.</p>
    <p>What can be said with a high de­gree of cer­tainty is that trade fric­tion and ne­go­ti­a­tions be­tween the EU and the UK will be­come a per­ma­nent fea­ture, a con­stant tus­sle. That is the in­evitable con­se­quence of be­ing ad­ja­cent to a big uni­fied market. So, at least in this re­spect, the cur­rent treaty is not the end of the dis­pute be­tween London and Brus­sels; it is not even the be­gin­ning of the end.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish gov­ern­ment will also dis­cover that it will not de­liver on an­other prom­ise it made when it pulled the coun­try out of the EU: that of tak­ing back con­trol of Bri­tain’s bor­ders. Al­though the num­ber of EU mi­grants has fallen and is guar­an­teed to fall fur­ther, the chances are high that cheap labour from east­ern Europe will still work il­le­gally in Bri­tain.</p>
    <p>And clos­ing the bor­der to EU cit­i­zens does noth­ing to con­trol mi­gra­tory pres­sures from Third World coun­tries. The lat­est im­mi­gra­tion fig­ures are among the high­est recorded, a lit­tle-known fact the gov­ern­ment in London does not wish to dwell upon too much.</p>
    <p>And then, there is co­op­er­a­tion over for­eign and se­cu­rity poli­cies, where the Bri­tish will al­ways try to out­flank the Euro­peans, ei­ther by show­ing them­selves to be closer and more flex­i­ble in co­op­er­at­ing with the United States or by try­ing to plug them­selves into ex­ist­ing global mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Ahead lie years of these petty and of­ten silly com­pe­ti­tions, as well as a return to what the Bri­tish used to do best – which is to try to nur­ture unique re­la­tion­ships with key Euro­pean coun­tries to weaken the EU from in­side.</p>
    <p>For the moment, ev­ery­one in London de­nies such in­ten­tions. But then, ev­ery­one does so with a smirk. There is no ques­tion that, as much as Brus­sels would like to for­get about London, it will not be able to do so.</p>
    <p>Per­haps that is why, as one EU ne­go­tia­tor de­scribed the scene when the two sides fi­nally reached their deal on Christ­mas Eve, they nei­ther shook hands nor cel­e­brated. “We just sat there, look­ing at each other.”</p>
