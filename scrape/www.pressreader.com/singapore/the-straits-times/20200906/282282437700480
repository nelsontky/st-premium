    <p>Ho­tel Soloha in Teck Lim Road pro­vides an ex­cel­lent base to ex­plore Keong Saik, one of Sin­ga­pore’s hottest din­ing and drinks stretches, as I dis­cover on my one-night stay­ca­tion at the bou­tique ho­tel.</p>
    <p>I am no stranger to this neigh­bour­hood, which I find my­self at ev­ery week, ei­ther for din­ner, cock­tails, or both.</p>
    <p>But ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the lux­ury and con­ve­nience of be­ing able to go back to a chic and com­fort­able ho­tel room, with a spa-wor­thy rain shower and bed, af­ter a night of bar hop­ping – in­stead of fight­ing with the masses to get a cab home – might have ru­ined me for­ever.</p>
    <p>The year-old ho­tel with 45 rooms is among those that have re­opened for stay­ca­tions since mid-July.</p>
    <p>Here, eclec­tic and eye-catch­ing de­signs take cen­tre stage.</p>
    <p>The lush, jewel tones of its In­sta­gram-friendly trop­i­cal mod­ernism and ur­ban jun­gle theme ex­tend from its lit-up bar-cum-re­cep­tion area to the menagerie of an­i­mals painted on the lift shaft.</p>
    <p>Built across three ad­ja­cent her­itage shop­houses, the rooms are small, rang­ing from 11 sq m for a deluxe sin­gle room to 28 sq m for a fam­ily loft. That said, the space feels more adult and bet­ter-suited for cou­ples or a solo stay. Prob­a­bly too much of a squeeze for a fam­ily.</p>
    <p>But an il­lu­sion of space is achieved via large win­dows, which let plenty of light in. There is also the op­tion to roll down dim-out or black-out blinds for pri­vacy.</p>
    <p>Mir­rors in the room add to the ex­pan­sive ef­fect, com­plete with space-op­ti­mis­ing touches like safes built into draw­ers.</p>
    <p>The space feels lux­u­ri­ous, thanks to the mar­ble fit­tings and a Ger­man-en­gi­neered shower, which is the high­light.</p>
    <p>My loft room ($168++) has a sturdy lad­der which climbs up to a sur­pris­ingly com­fort­able bed with a Sony flat screen, but I would prob­a­bly not want to mount a fid­dly lad­der af­ter a night out.</p>
    <p>Af­ter my check-in on a rainy Satur­day, I have lunch at the in-house Takeshi Noo­dle Bar, with its stand­out, rich tonkotsu broth. Then, it is on to plan­ning my night out on a street with both world-class wa­ter­ing holes and tra­di­tional favourites.</p>
    <p>When I say spots are a hop, skip, and a jump away, I am not ex­ag­ger­at­ing. It takes me less than a minute to saunter to Span­ish restau­rant Olivia for a cheeky mid-af­ter­noon cock­tail and dessert.</p>
    <p>I am also a short stroll from Dux­ton Hill, Chi­na­town and Tan­jong Pa­gar, but I de­cide to drink in Keong Saik, which has a calmer en­ergy in the day­time than when it fills up at night.</p>
    <p>I even con­tem­plate do­ing a burnt cheese­cake taste test, since Keong Saik Bak­ery, No Sleep Club, Olivia and Esquina, which of­fer it, are all within 100m of the ho­tel.</p>
    <p>But I save the space for beers and grub at the newly opened Heart Of Dark­ness brew­pub at the head of Keong Saik Road, which is the start­ing point for my drinks-fu­elled night. It in­cludes a stop at Ernest Hem­ing­way-themed The Old Man, ranked No. 38 on The World’s 50 Best Bars list.</p>
    <p>Frankly, I am spoilt for choice. The stretch bursts with meal op­tions at all times of the day, whether it is a tra­di­tional kaya toast and kopi break­fast at Tong Ah Eat­ing House; African fare for lunch at Kafe Utu; an es­cape to a Mi­lan- style tav­erna at Bar Mi­lano for aper­i­tivo hour; or a one-Miche­lin-star meal at Burnt Ends – just two doors away from the ho­tel, if only I can snag an elu­sive reser­va­tion.</p>
    <p>Op­tions also abound in Kreta Ayer Road, where sup­per awaits at Mount Faber Nasi Le­mak, open till 4.30am daily.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the ho­tel’s concierge ser­vice leaves much to be de­sired. Un­like high-end ho­tels, it does not seem to have tie-ups with its neigh­bours and is un­able to help se­cure a book­ing at the plethora of restau­rants sur­round­ing it.</p>
    <p>This just means that your stay­ca­tion will re­quire a lit­tle ex­tra plan­ning, but at least you will have a com­fort­able bed to re­turn to af­ter a night on the town.</p>
    <p>• HOT TIP: Even though you are stay­ing within walk­ing dis­tance of the hottest restau­rants and bars, do not count on rock­ing up to one at the last minute. A lways make a reser­va­tion be­cause places get booked out quickly, es­pe­cially on Fri­day nights.</p>
