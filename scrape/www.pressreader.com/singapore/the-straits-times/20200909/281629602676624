    <p>A to­tal of 11 mil­lion masks were given out to Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents, along with free hand sani­tiser, as part of ef­forts by Te­masek to sup­port the na­tion’s fight against the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, about one mil­lion face shields were dis­trib­uted to young school­child­ren and front-line work­ers in the food and bev­er­age in­dus­try, while 250,000 oxime­ters – de­vices used to mea­sure blood oxy­gen lev­els – were do­nated to var­i­ous groups in the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Mr Dil­han Pil­lay, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Te­masek In­ter­na­tional, told re­porters dur­ing its year-end re­view yes­ter­day that the do­na­tions were part of Te­masek’s ef­forts to strengthen lo­cal com­mu­ni­ties and foster col­lec­tive re­silience amid the Covid-19 cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The in­vest­ment com­pany’s so­cial and char­ity arm, Te­masek Foun­da­tion, has com­mit­ted $800 mil­lion to bat­tle Covid-19.</p>
    <p>As at July, around $400 mil­lion has been spent, with $250 mil­lion of this di­rected to Covid-19-re­lated ther­a­peu­tics, and re­search and devel­op­ment for vac­cines.</p>
    <p>“Capital has also been set aside in the in­vest­ment space for vac­cine devel­op­ment and man­u­fac­tur­ing, which is part of the com­pany’s ap­proach to deal­ing with Covid-19,” said Mr Pil­lay.</p>
    <p>Te­masek has sup­ported Te­masek</p>
    <p>Foun­da­tion and its part­ners in five key ar­eas: di­ag­no­sis, con­tain­ment and con­tact trac­ing, treat­ment, pro­tec­tion and pre­ven­tion, and en­able­ment, which en­tails the do­na­tion of key sup­plies such as masks, test kits and ven­ti­la­tors to some 35 coun­tries world­wide.</p>
    <p>More than 400 of its staff have vol­un­teered for both lo­cal and world­wide ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>Lo­cally, its sup­port spans key ar­eas such as pro­vid­ing swab test booths to lo­cal gen­eral prac­ti­tioner clin­ics, as well as sup­port­ing firms in com­ing up with a novel, re­motely con­trolled ven­ti­la­tor used to treat more se­ri­ous cases, and po­ten­tial drug treat­ments for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Yeoh Keat Chuan, deputy head of Sin­ga­pore projects and se­nior man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the en­ter­prise devel­op­ment group at Te­masek In­ter­na­tional, said he is heart­ened by the meld­ing of com­mu­nity ef­forts in both the pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors in the fight against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, lim­its in the overseas sup­ply of na­sopha­ryn­geal swab tests, which could in turn limit lo­cal test­ing, were over­come by the lo­cal com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Re­search in­sti­tutes, hos­pi­tals, and small and medium-sized en­ter­prises came to­gether to de­sign, val­i­date and sub­se­quently man­u­fac­ture their own swabs.</p>
    <p>“We started with 3D print­ing be­cause this was the fastest way to get the swabs made, and sub­se­quently we have moved to in­jec­tion mould­ing (once we had mas­tered) the skills needed, and by the end of the year, we would have man­u­fac­tured 20 mil­lion swabs,” Mr Yeoh said.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary, Te­masek an­nounced wage re­straint mea­sures to lend sup­port to its port­fo­lio com­pa­nies, and the sav­ings from this were chan­nelled to­wards Covid-19 com­mu­nity ini­tia­tives.</p>
    <p>Te­masek chair­man Lim Boon Heng said: “We de­cided very early to pitch in and mar­shal our re­sources and ca­pa­bil­i­ties across our net­work of part­ners and port­fo­lio com­pa­nies to help in the fight against Covid-19. Do­ing right and do­ing good has never been more crit­i­cal – no one is safe, till ev­ery­one is safe.”</p>
