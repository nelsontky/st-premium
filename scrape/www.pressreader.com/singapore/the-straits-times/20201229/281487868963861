    <p>The ar­chi­tec­ture firm be­hind the de­sign of three blocks at Build-ToOrder (BTO) project St Ge­orge’s Tow­ers has bagged a top de­sign award for Housing Board projects in a year that saw HDB name a record num­ber of win­ners.</p>
    <p>Built in the Kal­lang-Wham­poa district, and tow­er­ing over low­er­rise de­vel­op­ments in the ma­ture es­tate, each block boasts a sky ter­race on the 24th storey fit­ted with fit­ness equip­ment and benches where res­i­dents can catch un­blocked views of the city and the Wham­poa River.</p>
    <p>HDB yes­ter­day gave out 35 awards for de­sign, con­struc­tion and engi­neer­ing ex­cel­lence, the largest num­ber handed out since the HDB Awards started in 2008.</p>
    <p>The win­ners were picked from a short­list of 72 projects across the three cat­e­gories.</p>
    <p>The dis­tinc­tive fea­tures of St Ge­orge’s Tow­ers won Look Ar­chi­tects the HDB de­sign award un­der the housing cat­e­gory. Un­like most HDB blocks, win­dows in the three blocks are laid out in a stag­gered for­mat ev­ery six floors.</p>
    <p>Launched in 2014, St Ge­orge’s Tow­ers’ 738 homes com­prise stu­dio apartments as well as three­room and four-room flats. Half the 151 stu­dio apartments were set aside for se­niors who wished to move to a smaller flat in the same town or within 2km of their pre­vi­ous flat, or live near or with their par­ents and mar­ried child.</p>
    <p>To en­cour­age ac­tive age­ing, the housing project is in­te­grated with a se­nior ac­tiv­ity cen­tre and com­mu­nal spa­ces with roof as well as rain gar­dens that line the wa­ter­front. Pep­pered around the es­tate are mu­rals and precinct floor mark­ers de­pict­ing the area’s his­tory as a swamp­land.</p>
    <p>Alkaff Vista at Bi­dadari, de­signed by ADDP Ar­chi­tects, was the other project which won the HDB de­sign award un­der the same housing cat­e­gory.</p>
    <p>The up­graded Hougang Town Cen­tre, which is filled with fish­ing vil­lage im­agery and a swamptheme play­ground in­spired by its past as a fresh­wa­ter swamp, was also lauded for its good de­sign.</p>
    <p>SQFT Ar­chi­tects led the project un­der the HDB’s Re­mak­ing our Heart­land pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>All 10 housing projects which bagged HDB con­struc­tion awards achieved Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Author­ity’s qual­ity bench­mark Con­struc­tion Qual­ity Assess­ment Sys­tem (Con­quas) scores above 90.</p>
    <p>The de facto na­tional yard­stick for the in­dus­try was in­tro­duced in 1989.</p>
    <p>Two BTO projects – Tampines GreenView and Meadow Spring @ Yishun – by Ho Lee Con­struc­tion and BHCC Con­struc­tion re­spec­tively were awarded the Con­quas Star rat­ing, the high­est pos­si­ble ac­co­lade for con­struc­tion and work­man­ship qual­ity.</p>
    <p>HDB chief ex­ec­u­tive Cheong Koon Hean said the large num­ber of awards this year af­firms the high stan­dards achieved by in­dus­try part­ners in help­ing the HDB cre­ate a qual­ity liv­ing en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>“Our ar­chi­tec­tural and engi­neer­ing con­sul­tants have dis­played ex­cel­lent con­sid­er­a­tion of site con­text and pro­duced well thoughtout, at­trac­tive and creative de­signs, while our build­ing con­trac­tors have in­no­va­tively over­come con­straints and dis­played high con­struc­tion pro­duc­tiv­ity and ef­fi­ciency,” she added.</p>
