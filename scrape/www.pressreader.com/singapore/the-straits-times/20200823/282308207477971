    <p>The re­mote shrine, called Ber­lin Heilig­tum, on the western part of Pu­lau Ubin, hon­ours the mem­ory of a Ger­man girl who died dur­ing World War I.</p>
    <p>She is said to have fallen to her death in a gran­ite quarry one night in Au­gust 1914, while run­ning from Bri­tish sol­diers.</p>
    <p>The story goes that she lived on the is­land of Pu­lau Ubin hap­pily with her fam­ily at the on­set of World War I. As a re­sult of the war, Ger­man na­tion­als were sub­ject to in­tern­ment by the colo­nial Bri­tish gov­ern­ment as hos­tile aliens.</p>
    <p>It is be­lieved that her spirit is trapped in a time warp be­cause of the vi­o­lent na­ture of her death, and she still thinks she is alive.</p>
    <p>Mr Boyd says he has heard from</p>
    <p>Ubin vil­lagers that in the 1970s, a fire broke out near the shrine dur­ing a Chi­nese opera per­for­mance, caus­ing the deaths of sev­eral mem­bers of the per­form­ing troupe.</p>
    <p>“When I car­ried out a para­nor­mal in­ves­ti­ga­tion in 2013, which can be seen on my Ghost Files series on Face­book, the re­sults were off the charts. The cam­era recorded ghostly go­ings-on and a strange voice was even heard com­ing from in­side the shrine,” he claims.</p>
    <p>But gifts of dolls and cos­met­ics seem to please the Ger­man girl, say 4D and Toto diehards, who stack these of­fer­ings at her grave to hope­fully ex­tract win­ning num­bers.</p>
