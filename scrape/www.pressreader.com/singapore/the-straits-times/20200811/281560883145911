    <p>Peo­ple in In­done­sia are ditch­ing the queues at jew­ellers and in­stead snap­ping up gold on­line. In re­cent years, e-com­merce sites, jew­ellers, gold min­ers and mo­bile pay­ment plat­forms have col­lab­o­rated with one an­other to of­fer digital gold in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian house­wife Novi Ristyanie was shop­ping on e-com­merce start-up Bukala­pak last year when she stum­bled upon a glit­ter­ing of­fer to “buy gold on­line eas­ily and cheaply from only 100 ru­piah”, which is about one Sin­ga­pore cent.</p>
    <p>In­trigued, the 34-year-old opened an ac­count on the app’s BukaE­mas gold in­vest­ment fea­ture, bought $5 worth of the pre­cious metal and grew her in­vest­ment “lit­tle by lit­tle” to $400.</p>
    <p>She made a profit of $100 when she sold her in­vest­ment last month, as the price of gold soared to record highs amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“I did it for fun. The gold I bought is prob­a­bly the size of a grain of rice! Now I re­gret sell­ing too early as gold prices are at epic highs,” she said, laugh­ing.</p>
    <p>Ms Novi also in­vests in shares and bonds.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic down­turn and global un­cer­tainty have once again bur­nished gold’s ap­peal as a safe haven as­set, with its price breach­ing US$2,000 an ounce last Wed­nes­day for the first time in his­tory.</p>
    <p>In In­ter­net-crazy In­done­sia, where uni­corn start-ups thrive, peo­ple are ditch­ing the queues at jew­ellers to buy neck­laces and are in­stead snap­ping up gold on­line.</p>
    <p>In re­cent years, e-com­merce sites, jew­ellers, gold min­ers and mo­bile pay­ment plat­forms have col­lab­o­rated with one an­other to of­fer digital gold in­vest­ments.</p>
    <p>Val­ues may dif­fer among plat­forms, but gen­er­ally users are able to buy and sell gold for as lit­tle as 100 ru­piah for 0.0002g, through a mo­bile app.</p>
    <p>They can buy in in­stal­ments us­ing var­i­ous pay­ment meth­ods such as bank trans­fers or the app’s e-pay­ment sys­tem, and when their stash reaches at least 1g, they can have the phys­i­cal gold de­liv­ered to their doorsteps.</p>
    <p>Ms Dhinda Arisyiya, Bukala­pak’s head of in­vest­ment so­lu­tions, said the sim­plic­ity and af­ford­abil­ity of the plat­form’s BukaE­mas fea­ture – which has six mil­lion users – give In­done­sians from all walks of life a chance to in­vest in gold.</p>
    <p>Even those without bank ac­counts can do so, buy­ing through Bukala­pak’s part­ner mom-and-pop shops in small towns across the coun­try, she said.</p>
    <p>“Users can also trans­fer their bal­ance to their loved ones in vil­lages as a form of re­mit­tance any time they want, in a few min­utes,” she added.</p>
    <p>In­done­sians need lit­tle con­vinc­ing about the mer­its of gold. Af­ter all, South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy, with a pop­u­la­tion of 270 mil­lion, is one of the world’s top pro­duc­ers of gold. In­vest­ing in gold is not un­fa­mil­iar.</p>
    <p>“In­done­sian con­sumers tend to view gold as a pre­ferred in­vest­ment prod­uct due to its long-term sta­bil­ity, rel­a­tively lower risk pro­file and syariah-friendly na­ture,” said Mr Budi Gan­da­soe­brata, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of GoPay, the digital wal­let and pay­ment so­lu­tions plat­form of ride-hail­ing com­pany Go­jek.</p>
    <p>Go­jek launched GoIn­ves­tasi, its digital in­vest­ment plat­form that al­lows users to seam­lessly in­vest, start­ing with digital gold, in June.</p>
    <p>Un­tapped de­mand for digital gold in­vest­ments is also sig­nif­i­cant as many In­done­sians lack ac­cess to fi­nan­cial prod­ucts de­spite high mo­bile pen­e­tra­tion in the coun­try, Mr Budi added.</p>
    <p>Like any in­vest­ment, buy­ing digital gold is gen­er­ally safe, as long as users en­sure they buy from cred­i­ble com­pa­nies, cy­ber-se­cu­rity ex­pert Al­fons Tanu­jaya told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“Users should be care­ful not to buy from dodgy com­pa­nies, which tend not to pub­li­cise their ac­tiv­i­ties and in­stead get mem­bers to do the mar­ket­ing to avoid be­ing iden­ti­fied by the au­thor­i­ties. These are Ponzi schemes,” he said.</p>
    <p>THE GOLD RUSH</p>
    <p>Mr Ge­orge Budi Su­mantri, 44, whose fam­ily has been in the jew­ellery busi­ness for more than 60 years, de­cided to strike out on his own in 2004.</p>
    <p>He set up Orori, but it was not un­til 2012 that his jew­ellery busi­ness went fully on­line.</p>
    <p>With a sound mo­bile pay­ment sys­tem and bet­ter In­ter­net con­nec­tiv­ity in In­done­sia, he ven­tured into the digital gold busi­ness in 2017 and built the e-mas.com plat­form, which al­lows cus­tomers to not only buy and sell gold, but also trans­fer their bal­ance to any e-wal­let of their choice.</p>
    <p>About 280,000 peo­ple are ac­tively us­ing the app, with 80,000 join­ing this year as In­done­sia went into par­tial lock­down be­cause of the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic has changed peo­ple’s be­hav­iour. Since they can­not go any­where, they are ei­ther buy­ing phys­i­cal gold on­line or buy­ing digital gold,” Mr Ge­orge told The</p>
    <p>Straits Times. “Through their hand­phones, they can buy gold in­stantly, any­where, at any time, 24/7,” he added.</p>
    <p>Soft­ware en­gi­neer Ari Awan, 39, started buy­ing gold from e-mas.com only last year to di­ver­sify his in­vest­ment port­fo­lio. He said: “I buy digital gold for the con­ve­nience. I did not plan to sell it and (planned to) give it to my chil­dren, but look­ing at the prices now, the high­est in his­tory, I’m think­ing of sell­ing it.”</p>
    <p>The gold craze has proved ir­re­sistible to some busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>In­done­sian busi­ness con­glom­er­ate Sam­po­erna Group launched its gold bar line, Waris, last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The group’s sub­sidiary, Sam­po­erna Gold, is of­fer­ing 10g 99.99 per cent fine gold bars, and in the near fu­ture, 1g and 5g vari­ants, too.</p>
    <p>Sam­po­erna Gold chief ex­ec­u­tive Ge­orge Irawan told The Straits Times that the grow­ing mid­dle class as well as digital plat­forms will only drive the de­mand for pre­cious metal in In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing pe­ri­ods of eco­nomic un­cer­tainty, gold be­comes an at­trac­tive safe haven in­stru­ment and hedge against in­fla­tion,” he said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Mr Ivan Lingga, co­founder of jew­eller Lino & Sons, be­lieves phys­i­cal stores will be around for some time yet.</p>
    <p>He said that while gold sales re­main brisk on his busi­ness’ e-com­merce jew­ellery plat­form Whi­zliz.com, con­sumers still lack un­der­stand­ing of how on­line busi­nesses work.</p>
    <p>He said: “When you shop off­line, sales rep­re­sen­ta­tives can di­rectly as­sist. Take di­a­monds, for in­stance – they can ex­plain the qual­ity, the cut and the colour. There isn’t any­one to do that on­line.</p>
    <p>“Some cus­tomers may worry about items going miss­ing or (get­ting) stolen, but our ship­ping is se­cure and our items are in­sured. We need time to gain cus­tomers’ trust.</p>
    <p>“This virus is a bless­ing in dis­guise for our in­dus­try. Although the fu­ture of shop­ping is on­line, we need more time.”</p>
