    <p>A di­verse group of more than 100 peo­ple – stu­dents, re­tirees, house­wives and pro­fes­sion­als from fields such as law and tech­nol­ogy – have made com­mon cause over help­ing chil­dren from lower-in­come fam­i­lies in Chai Chee. The group serves them through free pro­grammes such as a home­work club and ex­cur­sions.</p>
    <p>We don’t want to be a tu­ition cen­tre or a day­care cen­tre, but a com­mu­nity – or a kam­pung – which comes to­gether to help those among us who need a bit more sup­port.</p>
    <p>MR JAREL TANG, who founded the KidzCare@Kem­ban­gan-Chai Chee ini­tia­tive seven years ago with his friend, Mr Fung Chun Chang.</p>
    <p>It is a di­verse group of more than 100 peo­ple – stu­dents, re­tirees, house­wives and pro­fes­sion­als from fields such as law and tech­nol­ogy – who have made com­mon cause over help­ing chil­dren from low­er­in­come fam­i­lies in Chai Chee.</p>
    <p>The vol­un­teers, re­cruited mostly through friends and word of mouth, are part of KidzCare@Kem­ban­gan-Chai Chee, an ini­tia­tive un­der the Kem­ban­gan Chai Chee Youth Net­work. They are keen to help the chil­dren suc­ceed in life and have ac­cess to op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive was founded seven years ago by two friends – Mr Jarel Tang, 25, a man­age­ment con­sul­tant, and Mr Fung Chun Chang, 28, a busi­ness de­vel­op­ment man­ager at an ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence start-up.</p>
    <p>Mr Tang said: “Not ev­ery child may have the same start­ing point in terms of fam­ily re­sources. Our hope is that we can pro­vide the chil­dren with some ad­di­tional sup­port so that ev­ery child has the op­por­tu­ni­ties to suc­ceed in life, and along the way, pro­vide their fam­i­lies with a bet­ter fu­ture as well.”</p>
    <p>The group serves about 150 chil­dren through its free pro­grammes, in­clud­ing its first – a home­work club where stu­dents can get help with their school­work from vol­un­teers – and tu­ition pro­grammes for Pri­mary 5 and 6 pupils and low­er­sec­ondary stu­dents. It also has a read­ing pro­gramme for kin­der­garten and lower pri­mary pupils.</p>
    <p>Prior to the Covid-19 pan­demic, the group also or­gan­ised ex­cur­sions to places of in­ter­est for the chil­dren sev­eral times a year. Ear­lier this month, this re­sumed with a trip to Jurong Bird Park.</p>
    <p>When the group first be­gan, the home­work club was held us­ing fold­able ta­bles and chairs at an open-air pav­il­ion lo­cated near some of the rental block flats in Chai Chee. Now, ESR-Reit, which op­er­ates Viva Busi­ness Park in the area, has al­lowed the group to use some of the air-con­di­tioned class­rooms in the build­ing for free, said Mr Tang.</p>
    <p>Through the pro­grammes, the chil­dren have been able to cope bet­ter in school, as well as de­velop self-con­fi­dence and val­ues like dis­ci­pline and re­spect for oth­ers, said Mr Tang.</p>
    <p>Some of the pro­grammes had to take a pause this year dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, and are now slowly be­ing ramped up. Next year, KidzCare plans to serve more chil­dren on a weekly ba­sis.</p>
    <p>The group reaches out to chil­dren through house vis­its and other out­reach ac­tiv­i­ties, said Mr Tang.</p>
    <p>“We’re also work­ing with Be­dok So­cial Ser­vice Of­fice to run a pi­lot for an af­ter-school study cor­ner start­ing 2021,” he added.</p>
    <p>“We don’t want to be a tu­ition cen­tre or a day­care cen­tre, but a com­mu­nity – or a kam­pung – which comes to­gether to help those among us who need a bit more sup­port.”</p>
