    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans can com­mem­o­rate the na­tion’s 55th birthday by par­tic­i­pat­ing in GetAc­tive! Singapore. There are a host of vir­tual events, in­clud­ing Chal­lenge 55, which re­quires par­tic­i­pants to clock 5,500 steps in­di­vid­u­ally or 55,000 steps as a team by Aug 9. The pro­ceeds from this event will go to a food char­ity.</p>
    <p>To com­mem­o­rate the na­tion’s 55th birthday, sports event com­pany Pink Ap­ple or­gan­ised Chal­lenge 55, a vir­tual event to en­cour­age people to be healthy while cel­e­brat­ing Na­tional Day.</p>
    <p>Chal­lenge 55 re­quires par­tic­i­pants to clock 5,500 steps in­di­vid­u­ally or 55,000 steps as a team by</p>
    <p>Aug 9 and the pro­ceeds from this event will go to food char­ity Food from the Heart.</p>
    <p>Sarah Pomegas, a se­nior events ex­ec­u­tive from Pink Ap­ple, said: “We wanted to re­late it to Singapore’s birthday and en­cour­age people to cel­e­brate to­gether as one.”</p>
    <p>The event is one of the more than 230 projects sup­ported by Sport Singapore (SportSG) un­der this year’s Ac­tive En­abler Pro­gramme (AEP), which of­fers $2 mil­lion in grants. SportSG called on the sports in­dus­try to come up with creative solutions that would en­able the masses to stay ac­tive while ad­her­ing to dis­tanc­ing mea­sures.</p>
    <p>The AEP is part of SportSG’s GetAc­tive! Singapore (GASG) cam­paign, which aims to rally people across the country through sport to cel­e­brate Na­tional Day amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of SportSG Lim Teck Yin said: “GetAc­tive! Singapore 2020 will con­tinue to en­able our people to con­nect as one and cel­e­brate the na­tion’s birthday.</p>
    <p>“It has been a chal­leng­ing year, but it has given us the im­pe­tus to de­velop creative and di­verse ways for the com­mu­nity to stay ac­tive, while prac­tis­ing safe dis­tanc­ing. We hope GetAc­tive! Singapore will in­spire all Sin­ga­pore­ans to get mov­ing, as­pire to live better and stay strong and united.”</p>
    <p>While many of the ac­tiv­i­ties for this year’s edi­tion of the an­nual na­tional sport cam­paign have been shifted on­line in light of the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion, there are still many ini­tia­tives for the local com­mu­nity to par­tic­i­pate in.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Day Pa­rade work­out has gone vir­tual and par­tic­i­pants can look for­ward to ex­er­cis­ing to a remix of the Na­tional Day Pa­rade theme song Ev­ery­thing I Am, ar­ranged by mu­sic di­rec­tor Don Rich­mond.</p>
    <p>Shar­ifa Nor­l­iza, who was in charge of the team that came up with this year’s work­out, said: “Now that it’s come on­line, it’s a lot eas­ier and it makes it even more ac­ces­si­ble. You don’t have to phys­i­cally come down to en­joy the work­outs or the fes­tiv­i­ties, we have things go­ing on through the vir­tual side of the house and ev­ery­one can be con­nected.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans are also en­cour­aged to take part in the cam­paign’s photo con­test by post­ing pic­tures of them­selves work­ing out in na­tional colours on social me­dia with the hash­tag #GetAc­tiveSG.</p>
    <p>The con­test will run from Fri­day to Aug 7, and 55 par­tic­i­pants stand a chance to win more than $4,000 worth of vouch­ers.</p>
    <p>There will also be the in­au­gu­ral Schools GASG Work­out Com­pe­ti­tion, which will see stu­dents across the country do­ing the work­out.</p>
    <p>One can also take part in var­i­ous vir­tual chal­lenges as part of GameOn Nila! E-spi­ra­tion Fit for Life (EFL). More than 7,600 stu­dents have signed up for EFL.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the pub­lic can show their sup­port for causes like ac­tive life­styles, giv­ing vul­ner­a­ble groups ac­cess to sport, vol­un­teer­ing as a mem­ber of Team Nila to pro­mote sport and also cheer on Team Singapore ath­letes through Pledges From The Heart.</p>
