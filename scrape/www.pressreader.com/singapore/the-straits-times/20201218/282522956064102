    <p>“Ev­ery­thing’s been such a whirl­wind since I won the Sin­ga­pore Fash­ion Award (at Sin­ga­pore Sto­ries 2020, held in Oc­to­ber by the Tex­tile and Fash­ion Fed­er­a­tion).</p>
    <p>My fi­ance and I have been apart for eight months be­cause of Covid-19 and I promised I’d visit him in the United States as soon as I was done with the com­pe­ti­tion. So, I’m cur­rently in Texas.</p>
    <p>An­other rea­son I went back to the US was to launch my de­signer face mask brand, Maskela, there.</p>
    <p>We’ve re­ceived good trac­tion in Sin­ga­pore – hit­ting six-fig­ure sales af­ter just four months. But un­for­tu­nately, face masks are still not fully em­braced in the US. I’m hop­ing Maskela can change at­ti­tudes by show­ing how masks can dou­ble as a stylish ac­ces­sory you can be proud to wear. My de­signer rental busi­ness, Covetella, is on hold in­def­i­nitely, so I can fo­cus on Maskela and my new fash­ion la­bel, Carol Chen.</p>
    <p>I had my eye on the cus­tomis­able Longchamp My Pliage bag (from $420) ever since a friend got it, and she ended up sur­pris­ing me with one right be­fore I left. It was so much fun go­ing to the store with our girl­friends to de­sign our own bags that re­flected our per­son­al­i­ties. So I guess I al­ready have my best gift this year.</p>
    <p>My fi­ance sur­prised me by get­ting us booked on the White House Christ­mas Tour, which I’m sure was no easy feat, given the re­duced ca­pac­ity this year. I’m so ex­cited to see all the mag­i­cal dec­o­ra­tions in per­son.</p>
    <p>It’s been a tur­bu­lent year for the US po­lit­i­cally, but hope­fully, some Christ­mas cheer will help bring peo­ple back to­gether.</p>
    <p>I’m just en­joy­ing be­ing home for the hol­i­days with my fam­ily. My sib­lings and I live in dif­fer­ent cities, so it’s re­ally spe­cial when we can all be to­gether. I’m es­pe­cially grate­ful ev­ery­one is healthy and that I de­cided to make the trip back de­spite the cir­cum­stances.”</p>
