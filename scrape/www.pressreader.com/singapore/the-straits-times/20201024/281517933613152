    <p>WASHINGTON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and ri­val Joe Bi­den be­gan a sprint through the fi­nal 11 days of the US pres­i­den­tial race yes­ter­day af­ter bat­tling over the Covid-19 pan­demic and per­sonal in­tegrity in their se­cond and fi­nal de­bate.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, 74, was to hold two ral­lies in the bat­tle­ground state of Florida, where opin­ion polls show a tight race. Mr Bi­den, 77, was slated to de­liver a speech in his home state of Delaware on his plans for lead­ing a re­cov­ery from the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, a Repub­li­can, adopted a more re­strained tone than he did dur­ing a chaotic first de­bate last month, when he re­peat­edly in­ter­rupted Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>But Thurs­day’s clash still fea­tured plenty of per­sonal at­tacks be­tween two men who evince lit­tle re­spect for each other, and Mr Trump kept fact-check­ers busy by lev­el­ling un­founded cor­rup­tion ac­cu­sa­tions at Mr Bi­den and his fam­ily.</p>
    <p>The ab­sence of dis­rup­tions yielded a more sub­stan­tive de­bate over a range of top­ics, in­clud­ing the econ­omy, race, cli­mate change, health­care and im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>But the coro­n­avirus, which has killed more than 222,000 peo­ple in the US, loomed over the pro­ceed­ings as it has through­out the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, who walked on­stage wear­ing a mask, de­liv­ered his clos­ing ar­gu­ment at the very start.</p>
    <p>“Any­one who’s re­spon­si­ble for that many deaths should not re­main as pres­i­dent of the United States of Amer­ica,” Mr Bi­den said in his first op­por­tu­nity to speak.</p>
    <p>“We’re about to go into a dark win­ter. A dark win­ter. And he has no clear plan,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, who has put his stew­ard­ship of the econ­omy at the cen­tre of his cam­paign, de­fended his ap­proach to the out­break and said the coun­try could not af­ford to close busi­nesses again de­spite fresh surges. “We’re learn­ing to live with it,” said Mr Trump, who has played down the virus for months. “We have no choice.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den re­torted: “Learn­ing to live with it? “Come on. We’re dy­ing with it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, whose in­stinct re­mains to run as an out­sider, por­trayed Mr Bi­den as a ca­reer politi­cian whose nearly 50-year record was in­sub­stan­tial. “You keep talk­ing about all th­ese things you’re go­ing to do,” Mr Trump pressed. “Why didn’t you get it done?”</p>
    <p>“All talk, no ac­tion,” he re­peated. But he did not lay out a clear agenda for a se­cond term, while Mr Bi­den re­turned again and again to Mr Trump’s four years as pres­i­dent, point­ing to the eco­nomic dam­age the virus has done to peo­ple’s lives.</p>
    <p>It was in the se­cond seg­ment of the de­bate that the ex­changes turned sharply per­sonal, as the fo­cus shifted to for­eign in­ter­fer­ence in US elec­tions. Mr Bi­den spoke first, warn­ing that coun­tries such as Rus­sia and Iran would “pay a price” for tam­per­ing with the cam­paign.</p>
    <p>Al­lud­ing to un­sub­stan­ti­ated sto­ries about him that have cir­cu­lated in con­ser­va­tive me­dia, Mr Bi­den chided Mr Trump for the ac­tions of “his buddy Rudy Gi­u­liani”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump rapidly es­ca­lated mat­ters, bran­dish­ing the un­proven al­le­ga­tions about Mr Bi­den’s son to ac­cuse his ri­val of per­son­ally tak­ing money from for­eign in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den re­jected the charge, say­ing he had “not taken a penny from any for­eign source ever in my life”.</p>
    <p>“There’s a rea­son why he’s bring­ing up all this malarkey,” Mr Bi­den said, look­ing di­rectly into the cam­era. “It’s not about his fam­ily and my fam­ily. It’s about your fam­ily, and your fam­ily’s hurt­ing badly.”</p>
    <p>Push­ing back on the Pres­i­dent, he cited a New York Times re­port that Mr Trump main­tained a Chi­nese bank ac­count. “Re­lease your tax re­turns,” Mr Bi­den said. “Or stop talk­ing about cor­rup­tion.”</p>
    <p>The for­mer vice-pres­i­dent was less sure-footed else­where in the de­bate. When un­der pres­sure from Mr Trump, he ap­peared to en­dorse the even­tual elim­i­na­tion of the oil in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump im­me­di­ately seized on Mr Bi­den’s re­mark for vot­ers in al­limpor­tant Penn­syl­va­nia, where Mr Bi­den’s po­si­tion on re­duc­ing frack­ing wins him few friends.</p>
    <p>But Mr Bi­den also had stand­out mo­ments of his own. He pounced when Mr Trump claimed he was the best pres­i­dent for black Amer­i­cans since Abra­ham Lin­coln, ac­cus­ing the Pres­i­dent of pour­ing “fuel on ev­ery sin­gle racist fire”.</p>
    <p>“Abra­ham Lin­coln here is one of the most racist pres­i­dents we’ve had in mod­ern his­tory,” Mr Bi­den quipped.</p>
    <p>In a de­bate that was orig­i­nally planned as a fo­rum on na­tional se­cu­rity, the two can­di­dates de­voted only a few glanc­ing ex­changes to the sub­ject.</p>
    <p>The tele­vised en­counter rep­re­sented one of Mr Trump’s last re­main­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties to re­shape a race that na­tional opin­ion polls show he has been los­ing for months, though the con­test is much tighter in some bat­tle­ground states likely to de­cide the elec­tion.</p>
