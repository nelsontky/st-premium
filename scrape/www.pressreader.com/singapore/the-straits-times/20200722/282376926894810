    <p>Last De­cem­ber, home-grown tech start-up Tem­pest re­leased Kirin, a tenkey­less (TKL) wire­less me­chan­i­cal key­board. It of­fers such su­perb value for money that I bought one.</p>
    <p>Now, Tem­pest has launched its suc­ces­sor – the Kirin v2. It comes in only black, un­like the orig­i­nal Kirin, which has black and white ver­sions.</p>
    <p>It of­fers three me­chan­i­cal switch op­tions – the clicky Kailh Box White (ver­sion tested), tac­tile Novelkeys x Kailh Box Royal and lin­ear Gateron Yel­low. Plus, it has a hotswop mod­u­lar­ity mech­a­nism that al­lows you to swop switches.</p>
    <p>So, if you pre­fer Cherry MX Blue, for in­stance, you can al­ways buy those switches and swop them with the ex­ist­ing ones on the Kirin v2.</p>
    <p>With the orig­i­nal Kirin, you get to choose from three types of Cherry MX me­chan­i­cal switches.</p>
    <p>As I have al­ways pre­ferred key­boards with clicky switches, I re­viewed the Kailh Box White ver­sion.</p>
    <p>At first look, the Kirin v2 does not seem to dif­fer much in ap­pear­ance from its pre­de­ces­sor, though its back­plate has been up­graded to alu­minium-al­loy from the orig­i­nal’s steel.</p>
    <p>The key­caps in the Kirin v2 have also been up­graded with dou­bleshot poly­buty­lene tereph­tha­late (PBT) ma­te­rial. The orig­i­nal Kirin al­ready uses PBT key­caps, which are of higher qual­ity than the acry­loni­trile bu­ta­di­ene styrene (ABS) key­caps found on most key­boards.</p>
    <p>PBT key­caps are more wear-re­sis­tant than ABS ones, so their let­ter­ing and tex­ture can be ex­pected to re­main in­tact even af­ter long and heavy us­age.</p>
    <p>Dou­bleshot PBT key­caps use two PBT lay­ers for even better wear-re­sis­tance. Also, the dou­bleshot PBT key­caps of the Kirin v2 do not have the grainy tex­ture of the ones on the orig­i­nal Kirin. They feel as smooth as ABS key­caps.</p>
    <p>The new key­board has RGB back­light (the orig­i­nal Kirin has white back­light). You can tog­gle through 19 pre­set light­ing ef­fects by press­ing the Func­tion and PageUp keys, as well as choose from nine colours by press­ing the Func­tion and PageDown keys. How­ever, there is no soft­ware like the Razer Sy­napse that of­fers fur­ther cus­tomi­sa­tion op­tions.</p>
    <p>Other im­prove­ments of the Kirin v2 in­clude the lat­est Blue­tooth 5.1 tech­nol­ogy for better power con­sump­tion and con­nec­tiv­ity, an im­proved 2,700mAh recharge­able bat­tery (up from the 1,850mAh ca­pac­ity of the orig­i­nal) and a car­ry­ing case.</p>
    <p>The Kirin v2 has a rather con­ser­va­tive colour scheme of black, white and pink key­caps, com­pared with the colour­ful scheme of the white ver­sion of the orig­i­nal Kirin (called Crayon).</p>
    <p>The ma­jor­ity of the key­caps are in white and black. The Escape, Enter and di­rec­tional key­caps are in pink, but can be swopped for black ones, which are in­cluded.</p>
    <p>As the Kirin v2 of­fers a con­ven­tional key­board lay­out, you do not need to re-learn the po­si­tion of keys. Mus­cle mem­ory al­lows me to type ef­fort­lessly with few er­rors.</p>
    <p>How­ever, I pre­fer the MX Cherry Blue switches over the Kailh Box White switches, as the lat­ter do not feel as “clicky” even though they re­quire less ac­tu­a­tion force.</p>
    <p>In the re­view, I used the Kirin v2 for about eight hours a day and the bat­tery went flat only af­ter two weeks. There were no in­stances of Blue­tooth con­nec­tiv­ity drops or lags.</p>
    <p>At $229, the Kirin v2 is a fair bit more ex­pen­sive than the orig­i­nal Kirin ($148).</p>
    <p>How­ever, I feel its fea­tures and im­prove­ments over the orig­i­nal make it well worth the ex­tra money.</p>
