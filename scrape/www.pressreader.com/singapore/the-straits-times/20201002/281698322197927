    <p>Wire­card’s de­par­ture leaves a big void in the pay­ments space, and could hit small busi­nesses and their cus­tomers most.</p>
    <p>As­sis­tant Pro­fes­sor Aurobindo Ghosh of Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity’s Lee Kong Chian School of Busi­ness said the episode will pro­pel more firms to use uni­ver­sally ac­cepted pay­ment sys­tems like PayNow, SGQR and mer­chant ac­qui­si­tion ser­vices pro­vided by the lo­cal banks. “This might also open up op­por­tu­ni­ties for new play­ers to come into the mar­ket to fill up the void,” he added.</p>
    <p>Most mar­ket watch­ers i nter­viewed noted that there is no lack of al­ter­na­tive providers, al­though the fees charged might be higher. Some busi­nesses may be tempted to pass on the costs, but this will be dif­fi­cult amid the down­turn in con­sumer spend­ing.</p>
    <p>Con­sumers may also find them­selves i ncon­ve­nienced as they may need to rely on cash if mer­chants are un­able to quickly find a suit­able re­place­ment to pro­vide pay­ment ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Dr Emir Hrn­jic of the Asian In­sti­tute of Dig­i­tal Fi­nance at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore noted that while Nets is an al­ter­na­tive, it is more ex­pen­sive and the ad­di­tional cost is likely to es­pe­cially hit small busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>“Other com­peti­tors of Wire­card, how­ever, may come up with in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions to drive the cost down,” he said. “For in­stance, soon af­ter the scan­dal broke, some com­peti­tors started poach­ing Wire­card’s cus­tomers by of­fer­ing them at­trac­tive cus­tom-tai­lored pack­ages and ex­pe­dited mi­gra­tion.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic’s busi­ness school se­nior lec­turer in mar­ket­ing and re­tail Amos Tan cited pay­ment op­tions like PayLah and PayNow that are gain­ing trac­tion.</p>
    <p>Ms Jac­que­lyn Tan, United Over­seas Bank’s head of group per­sonal fi­nan­cial ser­vices, said: “At the end of the day, it is about pro­vid­ing more op­tions to con­sumers. There will be con­ti­nu­ity for busi­nesses and their con­sumers as there are other mer­chant ac­quir­ers that can help them tran­si­tion to an al­ter­na­tive method. But in the end, it de­pends on the con­sumer, be­cause peo­ple choose which pay­ment method gives them the most value.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the many other op­tions avail­able, the Wire­card case also poses chal­lenges for busi­nesses, es­pe­cially smaller ones, as they tran­si­tion to al­ter­na­tive pay­ment ser­vice providers amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Prof Ghosh called it a “dou­ble whammy” for small firms.</p>
    <p>“Small and medium-sized en­ter­prises (SMEs) in dif­fer­ent sec­tors, par­tic­u­larly re­tail and F&B, in this cur­rent en­vi­ron­ment rely heav­ily on elec­tronic set­tle­ments of pay­ments from cus­tomers in a timely man­ner in or­der for them to pay their sup­pli­ers,” he noted.</p>
    <p>“The Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s an­nounce­ment for Wire­card to stop pay­ment pro­cess­ing means that small busi­nesses now have to spend time and money to look for al­ter­na­tive sys­tems, pur­chase equip­ment and pos­si­bly train for it. In the cur­rent cash­strapped en­vi­ron­ment, it might be dif­fi­cult for some SMEs to adopt the changes that eas­ily.”</p>
    <p>He added that these firms can­not wait long to ac­quire the new sys­tems as the de­lay could mean dif­fi­cul­ties in at­tract­ing and re­tain­ing cus­tomers in an en­vi­ron­ment where cash­less pay­ment is key.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said it is vi­tal for af­fected busi­nesses to en­sure they can con­tinue ac­cept­ing credit and debit cards, given how pop­u­lar these are as pay­ment op­tions.</p>
