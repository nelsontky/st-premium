    <p>LON­DON • One of the part­ners in the Saudi Ara­bian-led con­sor­tium has blamed the English Premier League for the col­lapse of their £305 mil­lion (S$540 mil­lion) takeover bid of Newcastle United.</p>
    <p>Amanda Stave­ley, whose in­vest­ment firm PCP Cap­i­tal Part­ners was part of a group com­pris­ing the king­dom’s sov­er­eign wealth arm, the Saudi Pub­lic In­vest­ment Fund (PIF), and Bri­tish prop­erty bil­lion­aire broth­ers, David and Si­mon Reuben, claimed their in­ter­est in the deal had died as the English top flight “kept mov­ing the goal posts”.</p>
    <p>Asked if the con­sor­tium blamed the Premier League, Bri­tish fi­nancier Stave­ley told The Times of Lon­don: “Of course we do. They had a chance, they say we have not an­swered all the ques­tions and we have done so. But the other clubs in the Premier League didn’t want it to hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“We are so heart­bro­ken for the Newcastle fans as the in­vest­ment that was go­ing to go into the club, es­pe­cially with ev­ery­thing hap­pen­ing with Brexit and Covid, would have been so im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“This is cat­a­strophic for them. It has been go­ing on for so long and the op­por­tu­nity was there.”</p>
    <p>When the bid was an­nounced in March, it ap­peared like the deal would be rub­ber-stamped, pend­ing the Premier League’s own­ers and di­rec­tors test.</p>
    <p>But the coro­n­avirus pan­demic meant it had to be placed on the back-burner, with the com­pe­ti­tion restart­ing only three months later.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing that pe­riod, ques­tions arose over pi­rate broad­casts of Premier League games in Saudi Ara­bia by state-spon­sored rogue net­work be­outQ, on top of op­po­si­tion by hu­man rights cam­paign­ers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Stave­ley in­sisted the group had cleared up the doubts only to be stonewalle­d by the Premier League, telling The Ath­letic: “The piracy is­sue was not an is­sue but we tried to re­solve it any­way. They tried to make the state of Saudi a di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>“The Premier League made it so hard. It would be un­prece­dented. No coun­try has ever be­come a di­rec­tor of a club. It’s ridicu­lous.”</p>
    <p>The fail­ure of the bid, which had a guar­an­tee of £250 mil­lion to be spent on build­ing the team over the next five years, left Newcastle fans dev­as­tated that Mike Ash­ley will re­main the club’s owner.</p>
    <p>Since tak­ing over at St James’ Park in 2007, the founder of Bri­tish sports good re­tailer Sport Di­rect has faced crit­i­cism over his un­will­ing­ness to dip into the trans­fer mar­ket and many Mag­pies fans saw the of­fer as a chance to re­vi­talise the sleep­ing gi­ants.</p>
    <p>Ex­press­ing their frus­tra­tion, the Newcastle United Sup­port­ers Trust said: “The sup­port­ers have been treated with con­tempt by large parts of the foot­ball me­dia and the Premier League dur­ing this failed takeover... We need an­swers.”</p>
