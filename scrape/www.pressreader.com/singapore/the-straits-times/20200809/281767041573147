    <p>When the coro­n­avirus ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore early this year, the coun­try’s key in­fec­tious dis­eases body had to move fast to re­spond, even though it was new and untested.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases (NCID) started full oper­a­tions in the mid­dle of last year, tak­ing over the func­tions of Tan Tock Seng Hospi­tal’s Com­mu­ni­ca­ble Dis­ease Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“We are op­er­at­ing un­der a very new set-up, a sys­tem and struc­ture that is yet to be tested. We had planned for a drill and ex­er­cise, but Covid-19 hap­pened first,” said NCID ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Leo Yee Sin, who has been awarded the Pub­lic Ad­min­is­tra­tion Medal (Sil­ver) in this year’s Na­tional Day Awards.</p>
    <p>“NCID’s ad­di­tional re­sources to han­dle an out­break... were stretched in the face of a fast-mov­ing virus of such large scale, much greater than the ex­pe­ri­ence of Sars had pre­pared us for,” she added.</p>
    <p>One of the most ful­fill­ing parts of fight­ing the pan­demic for Pro­fes­sor Leo is in mak­ing and shar­ing new dis­cov­er­ies about the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>She ex­plained that as Sin­ga­pore was among sev­eral Asian coun­tries to first de­tect Covid-19 cases from China, it could gen­er­ate new in­for­ma­tion through re­search to help other coun­tries de­velop their own re­sponses to the out­break.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing Covid-19 from other coron­aviruses, and sero­epi­de­mi­o­log­i­cal stud­ies look­ing at the de­gree of in­fec­tion in house­holds and close con­tacts of Covid-19 pa­tients and among health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>“Our staff have done a re­mark­able job. We un­der­stand our mis­sion, vi­sion and core val­ues,” said Prof Leo. “Every one of us has stepped up to fight the virus and there is unity and team­work. I also know they work very hard – be­yond their reg­u­lar hours – but I have not had any­one come to my room to com­plain.”</p>
    <p>She also com­mended the ef­forts and adapt­abil­ity of the staff from other health­care in­sti­tu­tions who have been de­ployed to beef up NCID oper­a­tions. The bat­tle is far from over, she said, adding that they are “rac­ing against time and yet still be­hind the virus”.</p>
