    <p>The is­sue of do­mes­tic maids work­ing il­le­gally for mul­ti­ple house­holds against their will has be­come a hot topic on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) clar­i­fied its stance on this il­le­gal de­ploy­ment (550 com­plaints yearly of maids il­le­gally de­ployed from 2017 to 2019, Sept 9). How­ever, there are maids who are will­ing to work il­le­gally as part-time maids dur­ing their rest days.</p>
    <p>MOM should clamp down on this and take stern ac­tion against the clean­ing agents that hire them, as well as the maids who work il­le­gally.</p>
    <p>Some time ago, I con­tacted an agent for a part-time maid to clean my house on week­ends. I was sur­prised when the maid told me she worked full time for her em­ployer but did side­line jobs dur­ing her days off on week­ends. I im­me­di­ately re­jected her ser­vice.</p>
    <p>I then ad­ver­tised in the clas­si­fied ads for a part-time maid. Those who re­sponded were full-time maids hold­ing work per­mits, but none was a Sin­ga­porean or PR.</p>
    <p>This in­di­cates that there are plenty of maids work­ing part time il­le­gally, which raises the ques­tion: Who is li­able for this il­le­gal de­ploy­ment? Would the in­no­cent em­ploy­ers be li­able? Would the per­son who hires them be li­able?</p>
    <p>The clean­ing agen­cies should be taken to task for hir­ing them to be de­ployed as part-time maids. The agents are break­ing the law by abet­ting a for­eigner to work on il­le­gal terms. House­holds which de­pend on part-time maids should stop us­ing them and re­port the agents to the au­thor­i­ties if the part-time maids are al­ready em­ployed full time at another house­hold.</p>
    <p>The self­ish ac­tions of the agents and part-time maids could sad­dle their in­no­cent em­ploy­ers with heavy fines and a ban on hir­ing other maids, while those who use their part-time ser­vices may face sim­i­lar penal­ties.</p>
