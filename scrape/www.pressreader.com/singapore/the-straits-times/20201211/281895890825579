    <p>Two in­ci­dents that were re­cently in the news high­light the need to con­sider a new ap­proach to health reg­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The first in­volved an In­te­grated Shield Plan (IP) in­surer, Aviva. Aviva was able to uni­lat­er­ally change the cov­er­age of its IPs with­out chang­ing its IP terms and con­di­tions. A let­ter in The Straits Times Fo­rum page asked the Min­istry of Health (MOH) and Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) to “ed­u­cate the pub­lic and doc­tors as to what spe­cific statutes are avail­able that can be used to reg­u­late an IP’s scope of cov­er­age” (Ed­u­cate pub­lic on laws reg­u­lat­ing IP plans, Oct 1). Thus far, this let­ter has not drawn any re­sponse from the au­thor­i­ties. We are also un­aware that such statutes ex­ist.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond in­ci­dent turned the spot­light on an on­line search en­gine op­ti­mi­sa­tion (SEO) com­pany called Doc­torxDen­tist (DXD). The com­pany drew the ire of the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal As­so­ci­a­tion as well as MOH and the Sin­ga­pore Med­i­cal Coun­cil (SMC) when it ini­tially re­fused to re­move the names and par­tic­u­lars of doc­tors and den­tists who did not want to be as­so­ci­ated with it from its web­site. The ob­jec­tions were twofold: First, that the pres­ence of the med­i­cal prac­ti­tion­ers’ par­tic­u­lars gave an “er­ro­neous im­pres­sion” that “MOH had en­dorsed or ap­proved” the plat­form; and sec­ond, that DXD had used the SMC’s doc­tor data­base with­out the coun­cil’s ap­proval.</p>
    <p>The SMC later pub­lished an ad­vi­sory to all doc­tors stat­ing that they should re­frain from par­tic­i­pat­ing in SEO plat­forms that make use of pa­tient feed­back and rat­ings, as such feed­back and rat­ings could be con­sid­ered pa­tient tes­ti­mo­ni­als. Publi­cis­ing pa­tient tes­ti­mo­ni­als is not per­mit­ted un­der the SMC’s Eth­i­cal Code and Eth­i­cal Guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Yet there was no men­tion that DXD had in­fringed any statute that reg­u­lated it as a health­care en­tity. For the in­flu­ence it sought to wield over health­care providers and their ser­vices, it is ironic that DXD could po­ten­tially get health­care providers in trou­ble for vi­o­lat­ing reg­u­la­tions and</p>
    <p>guide­lines but was ap­par­ently not it­self sub­ject to sim­i­lar du­ties and re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>If DXD had not mis­rep­re­sented MOH as en­dors­ing its plat­form or used the SMC data­base with­out per­mis­sion, then ar­guably DXD could have con­tin­ued with its core busi­ness model of pub­lish­ing all doc­tors’ names and cer­tain par­tic­u­lars with im­punity. In other words, it could tech­ni­cally es­cape any le­gal or reg­u­la­tory con­se­quences if it had constructe­d its own data­base from scratch.</p>
    <p>THE TRA­DI­TIONAL REG­U­LA­TORY AP­PROACH</p>
    <p>The tra­di­tional ap­proach to health reg­u­la­tion is to de­ter­mine what is li­cens­able or not and then pass laws that re­quire what is “li­cens­able” to in­deed be li­censed. To put it dif­fer­ently, li­cens­ing is the pre­ferred method to ef­fect di­rect reg­u­la­tion of a health­care en­tity or ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, li­cens­ing is tar­geted at:</p>
    <p>• Pro­fes­sion­als – they in­clude doc­tors, nurses, tra­di­tional Chi­nese medicine prac­ti­tion­ers, phys­io­ther­a­pists and con­tact lens prac­ti­tion­ers.</p>
    <p>• Fa­cil­i­ties – un­der the Pri­vate Hos­pi­tals and Med­i­cal Clinics Act (PHMC Act). In short, these in­clude hos­pi­tals, clinics, nurs­ing homes and clin­i­cal lab­o­ra­to­ries.</p>
    <p>• Products and equip­ment – the reg­u­la­tory in­stru­ments ap­pli­ca­ble here are the Medicines Act, Poi­sons Act, Health Products Act, Mis­use of Drugs Act and Ra­di­a­tion Pro­tec­tion Act.</p>
    <p>• Pro­ce­dures – as­sisted re­pro­duc­tion and tis­sue bank­ing are ex­am­ples of pro­ce­dures that re­quire a fa­cil­ity li­cence un­der the PHMC Act.</p>
    <p>This “de­ter­mine what is li­cens­able and reg­u­late through li­cens­ing” ap­proach has some draw­backs. In­vari­ably, some smaller groups of health­care work­ers such as chi­ro­prac­tors, home­opa­thy prac­ti­tion­ers and Ayurvedic medicine prac­ti­tion­ers fall through the cracks. The newly passed but yet to be op­er­a­tional Health­care Ser­vices Act (HCSA) ad­dresses some of the weak­nesses of the PHMC Act which it is sup­posed to re­place, but is al­ready look­ing like it does not go far enough.</p>
    <p>Un­der the PHMC Act, li­cens­able en­ti­ties must have a phys­i­cal ad­dress. Mo­bile clinics are for this rea­son not li­censed un­der this Act. The HCSA ad­dresses this gap by li­cens­ing an en­tity for the ser­vice it pro­vides, even if it does not have a phys­i­cal ad­dress. These “health­care ser­vices” are de­scribed un­der Sec­tion 3 of the Act:</p>
    <p>• as­sess­ment, di­ag­no­sis, treat­ment, pre­ven­tion or alle­vi­a­tion of any ail­ment, a con­di­tion, dis­abil­ity, dis­ease, dis­or­der or an in­jury af­fect­ing any part of the hu­man body or mind;</p>
    <p>• nurs­ing or re­ha­bil­i­ta­tive care of an in­di­vid­ual suf­fer­ing from an ail­ment, a con­di­tion, dis­abil­ity, dis­or­der or an in­jury;</p>
    <p>• con­duct of any clin­i­cal pro­ce­dure to change, or that is in­tended to change, the ap­pear­ance or anatomy of an in­di­vid­ual;</p>
    <p>• as­sess­ment of the health of an in­di­vid­ual; and</p>
    <p>• any other ser­vice of a med­i­cal or health­care na­ture that is pre­scribed.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the health­care en­vi­ron­ment and pro­vi­sion of health­care ser­vices have evolved to be sig­nif­i­cantly more com­plex and di­ver­si­fied than the “health­care ser­vices” frame­work that the HCSA will ad­dress.</p>
    <p>There are many be­hind-the-scenes stake­hold­ers in health­care ser­vices pro­vi­sion that need to be reg­u­lated di­rectly. En­ti­ties such as SEO plat­forms, third-party ad­min­is­tra­tors and man­aged care or­gan­i­sa­tions now ex­ert, or try to ex­ert, great in­flu­ence on health ser­vices pro­vi­sion, which in turn im­pacts pro­foundly how health­care pro­fes­sion­als and en­ti­ties give and pa­tients re­ceive health­care.</p>
    <p>While IP in­sur­ers are li­censed by the MAS, there does not ap­pear to be any leg­is­la­tion that di­rectly ap­plies to the health­care as­pects of IPs, such as scope of cov­er­age.</p>
    <p>The full bur­den and force of reg­u­la­tion of the cur­rent frame­work falls on li­censed en­ti­ties, while en­ti­ties that are just as im­pact­ful but not li­cens­able seem­ingly es­cape reg­u­la­tory scru­tiny. These reg­u­la­tory la­cu­nae need to be plugged.</p>
    <p>FAC­TOR IN HEALTH­CARE IM­PACT</p>
    <p>We would like to pro­pose a fur­ther evo­lu­tion of the “de­ter­mine what is li­cens­able and reg­u­late through li­cens­ing” ap­proach to reg­u­la­tion, one that also takes into ac­count “health­care im­pact”.</p>
    <p>In other words, an en­tity should be reg­u­lated not only be­cause it of­fers a health­care ser­vice, but also when its very ex­is­tence and busi­ness prac­tices di­rectly or in­di­rectly im­pact health­care de­liv­ery and pa­tient well-be­ing in sig­nif­i­cant ways.</p>
    <p>Real-life ex­am­ples in­clude man­aged care or­gan­i­sa­tions, third-party ad­min­is­tra­tors and IP in­sur­ers that can set prices for health­care providers and pa­tients, and de­ter­mine how re­fer­rals are made to only cer­tain providers as well as what pro­ce­dures and hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tions are re­im­bursable.</p>
    <p>There are also third-party ad­min­is­tra­tors and SEO com­pa­nies that claim to have “pa­tients” of their own and yet do not legally owe a duty of care to these “pa­tients”.</p>
    <p>In im­pact-based reg­u­la­tion, we pro­pose three cat­e­gories of non-li­censed en­ti­ties that should be reg­u­lated as li­cens­able en­ti­ties even if they do not pro­vide health­care ser­vices di­rectly; they are also re­quired to be in-prin­ci­ple com­pli­ant with the var­i­ous eth­i­cal codes and guide­lines of the li­censed health­care pro­fes­sion­als they have busi­ness trans­ac­tions with. The three cat­e­gories are:</p>
    <p>• en­ti­ties that are able to di­rect, or­gan­ise or in­flu­ence the pro­vi­sion of health­care ser­vices;</p>
    <p>• en­ti­ties that are able to set prices or in­flu­ence price-set­ting of health­care ser­vices; and</p>
    <p>• en­ti­ties that claim to have pa­tients and hence owe a di­rect or in­di­rect duty of care.</p>
    <p>If these en­ti­ties are com­pa­nies, then the di­rec­tors of these com­pa­nies must be held re­spon­si­ble for com­pli­ance. As there is a range of li­cens­able en­ti­ties, from pro­fes­sion­als to fa­cil­i­ties to products, MOH should be given lee­way to de­cide how the reg­u­la­tion of these non-li­censed en­ti­ties should ap­prox­i­mate, that is, whether as a pro­fes­sional (for ex­am­ple, a doc­tor) or as a fa­cil­ity (for ex­am­ple, a clinic).</p>
    <p>No doubt there will be reser­va­tions from cer­tain quar­ters that such an ap­proach will dis­cour­age in­no­va­tion. It need not be so. MOH has in the past em­ployed cer­tain reg­u­la­tory tools at its dis­posal that can be adapted for use in im­pact-based reg­u­la­tion. These in­clude the use of reg­u­la­tory sand­boxes as well as ex­emp­tion or­ders so that in­no­va­tors can find temporary shelter from reg­u­la­tion and en­force­ment un­der ex­ist­ing laws as they re­fine their busi­ness mod­els and health­care stake­hold­ers bet­ter un­der­stand new health­care pro­vi­sion and busi­ness mod­els.</p>
    <p>Such an “im­pact-based” ap­proach will fu­ture-proof our reg­u­la­tory frame­work by giv­ing the au­thor­i­ties greater flex­i­bil­ity and scope in plac­ing un­der scru­tiny the en­ti­ties that have ducked over­sight while prop­a­gat­ing prac­tices and busi­ness mod­els that could be con­trary to pub­lic in­ter­est. It will also in­crease pub­lic con­fi­dence in our health­care sys­tem as reg­u­la­tory ef­forts can be made to bear di­rectly on the un­seen (or poorly seen) hands that now in­flu­ence the de­liv­ery and busi­ness of health­care ser­vices pro­vi­sion.</p>
