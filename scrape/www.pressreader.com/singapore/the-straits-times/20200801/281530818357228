    <p>HELP­ING THOSE IN NEED</p>
    <p>There will be groups of peo­ple who are in greater need of our help and sup­port. We must con­tinue to help one an­other. We must al­ways be con­scious and sen­si­tive to the con­di­tions of those around ’’ us.</p>
    <p>THE MUFTI, DR NAZIRUDIN MOHD NASIR, in his ser­mon at Masjid Maarof in Jurong West yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>STAY­ING SAFE</p>
    <p>While I ap­pre­ci­ate that ar­range­ments have been made to visit the mosque to­day, I felt more com­fort­able pray­ing at ’’ home.</p>
    <p>MR AFIQ RAH­MAN, who used to pray at the Darus­salam Mosque in Cle­menti but stayed home this year.</p>
    <p>Prayers at mosques for Hari Raya Haji yes­ter­day were qui­eter due to safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to curb the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The usual prayer as­sem­bly at Masjid Sul­tan used to at­tract at least 5,000 wor­ship­pers but this year it was split into two ses­sions of just 50 peo­ple each.</p>
    <p>Mr Zainal Abidin, the head of sec­re­tariat at the mosque, which is one of Sin­ga­pore’s old­est and largest, told The Straits Times that clean­ers wiped down prayer mats and pub­lic ar­eas af­ter each ses­sion.</p>
    <p>Wor­ship­pers had to book a place and their tem­per­a­tures were checked be­fore en­try, he added.</p>
    <p>While 65 mosques were opened for Hari Raya Haji prayers yes­ter­day morn­ing, only a to­tal of 8,750 wor­ship­pers were able to at­tend.</p>
    <p>Most mosques held three ses­sions with no more than 50 wor­ship­pers – who had to book slots on­line – each time.</p>
    <p>Wor­ship­pers, in­clud­ing Mr Zainal, said the prayer ses­sions were more muted than in pre­vi­ous years due to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Se­nior ar­chi­tec­tural co­or­di­na­tor Sub­han Jab­bar Shah­je­han, 49, said he missed the bus­tle that usu­ally comes with Hari Raya Haji, in­clud­ing hav­ing the fam­ily rush to the mosque and catch­ing up with old friends and neigh­bours.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing to book spots meant los­ing some of the spon­tane­ity and festive fun of rush­ing to make it to the prayer ses­sions, added Mr Sub­han, who is mar­ried with two daugh­ters aged 16 and 17.</p>
    <p>Some wor­ship­pers who were un­able to se­cure a spot at a mosque con­ducted prayers at home.</p>
    <p>Mr Afiq Rah­man, 31, used to pray at the Darus­salam Mosque in Cle­menti near where he lives but he stayed put this year: “While I ap­pre­ci­ate that ar­range­ments have been made to visit the mosque to­day, I felt more com­fort­able pray­ing at home.</p>
    <p>“Be­sides, I think the slots were snapped up quickly on­line.”</p>
    <p>The Mufti, Dr Nazirudin Mohd Nasir, said in his ser­mon at Masjid Maarof in Jurong West yes­ter­day morn­ing that the Mus­lim com­mu­nity un­der­stands the spirit and wis­dom be­hind re­li­gious prac­tices, though Covid-19 placed lim­i­ta­tions on Hari Raya Haji cel­e­bra­tions this year.</p>
    <p>“We are also well aware that the sit­u­a­tion to­day will get more chal­leng­ing as many of us will be af­fected fi­nan­cially and in terms of em­ploy­ment,” he added.</p>
    <p>“There will be groups of peo­ple who are in greater need of our help and sup­port. We must con­tinue to help one an­other. We must al­ways be con­scious and sen­si­tive to the con­di­tions of those around us.”</p>
    <p>“Those among us who are in a rel­a­tively more com­fort­able state should help those fac­ing chal­lenges in these dif­fi­cult times.”</p>
    <p>Mus­lims mark Hari Raya Haji with prayers and the ko­r­ban rit­ual, which in­volves slaugh­ter­ing live­stock and dis­tribut­ing the meat to the poor.</p>
    <p>The ko­r­ban did not take place here this year. In­stead, the slaugh­ter was per­formed in Aus­tralia, and the meat will be chilled and shipped over to be dis­trib­uted to the needy.</p>

The haj sees one of the world&#x2019;s largest re&#xAD;li&#xAD;gious gath&#xAD;er&#xAD;ings. But lo&#xAD;cal me&#xAD;dia said that this year, only about 10,000 peo&#xAD;ple re&#xAD;sid&#xAD;ing in the king&#xAD;dom took part, com&#xAD;pared with last year&#x2019;s gath&#xAD;er&#xAD;ing of some 2.5 mil&#xAD;lion from all over the world.</p>
