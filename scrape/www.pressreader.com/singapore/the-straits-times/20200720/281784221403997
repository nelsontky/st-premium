    <p>HONG KONG • The coro­n­avirus is spread­ing out of con­trol in Hong Kong, with a record 108 new cases con­firmed, the fi­nance hub’s leader said yes­ter­day as she tight­ened so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures to tackle the sud­den surge in in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>In the last two weeks, in­fec­tions have spiked and doc­tors fear the lat­est out­break is now spread­ing un­de­tected in the densely packed ter­ri­tory of 7.5 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam told a news con­fer­ence that the city had recorded more than 100 cases in the past 24 hours, the most since the pan­demic took hold in late Jan­uary, tak­ing the tally to 1,886 pa­tients, 12 of whom have died.</p>
    <p>More than 500 in­fec­tions had been con­firmed in the last fort­night alone.</p>
    <p>“I think the sit­u­a­tion is re­ally crit­i­cal and there is no sign the sit­u­a­tion is be­ing brought un­der con­trol,” Mrs Lam told re­porters.</p>
    <p>She had an­nounced so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures last week, shut­ter­ing many busi­nesses in­clud­ing bars, gyms and night­clubs, and or­der­ing ev­ery­one to wear masks on pub­lic trans­port. Restau­rants were or­dered to only of­fer take­out ser­vices in the evenings.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam an­nounced even more reg­u­la­tions yes­ter­day, in­clud­ing plans to make it com­pul­sory to wear masks in in­door pub­lic places such as shop­ping cen­tres. Civil ser­vants are to work from home for a week from to­day, and only emer­gency and es­sen­tial pub­lic ser­vices will be pro­vided.</p>
    <p>As hos­pi­tal wards fill, of­fi­cials are also scram­bling to build a fur­ther 2,000 iso­la­tion rooms on bar­ren land near the city’s Dis­ney­land re­sort to mon­i­tor and treat those who test pos­i­tive, she added.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam called for land­lords to look at low­er­ing rents in the no­to­ri­ously ex­pen­sive city where in­equal­ity is ram­pant. She said fur­ther so­cial dis­tanc­ing mea­sures would be rolled out if the daily in­fec­tion rate did not ease in com­ing days. But she also said she was keen to avoid or­der­ing peo­ple to re­main at home.</p>
    <p>“We can’t just make a sim­ple and ex­treme move to cut ev­ery­thing at once,” Mrs Lam said.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties say test­ing will be ramped up, tar­get­ing high-risk pop­u­la­tions such as taxi driv­ers and restau­rant work­ers after clus­ters were found within their ranks.</p>
    <p>Some of the new in­fec­tions have swept through el­derly care homes, a ma­jor cause of con­cern given how deadly Covid-19 is to older peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said of­fi­cials would try to strike a bal­ance be­tween pro­tect­ing health and keep­ing the econ­omy par­tially afloat.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard to tell what kind of mea­sures we will need to roll out... many places have or­dered peo­ple to stay home,” she said, adding: “We haven’t adopted that in the last six months be­cause we wanted to main­tain a nor­mal life for ev­ery­one.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier yes­ter­day, an event by pro-democ­racy ac­tivists to mark the one-year an­niver­sary of an at­tack on a train sta­tion by an armed mob was stopped by po­lice for break­ing coro­n­avirus mea­sures that re­strict group gath­er­ings to four peo­ple.</p>
    <p>The Yuen Long at­tack, which saw demon­stra­tors and by­standers beaten up by more than 100 men with pipes and poles on July 21 last year, was one of the most vi­o­lent scenes of the city’s pro-democ­racy protests. Yes­ter­day, a small num­ber of protesters marked the an­niver­sary by chant­ing slo­gans in a shop­ping mall.</p>
