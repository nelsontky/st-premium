    <p>As she wrote and di­rected On The Rocks, a buddy movie about a fa­ther and a daugh­ter, film-maker Sofia Cop­pola drew on con­ver­sa­tions she had with own fa­ther, The God­fa­ther (1972) di­rec­tor Fran­cis Ford Cop­pola, and the un­usual re­la­tion­ship ad­vice he used to give her.</p>
    <p>Now stream­ing on Ap­ple TV+, Cop­pola’s film sees a young woman named Laura (Rashida Jones) start to worry that her hus­band Dean (Mar­lon Wayans) is cheat­ing on her.</p>
    <p>When she turns to her charm­ing but wom­an­is­ing fa­ther Felix (Bill Mur­ray) for ad­vice, he en­cour­ages her to stalk Dean and find out for sure. The two tail the lat­ter across New York City in var­i­ous latenight ca­pers, which were filmed be­fore the city went into its Covid-19 lock­down.</p>
    <p>Cop­pola – who won Best Orig­i­nal Screen­play Os­car for another com­edy drama she wrote and di­rected star­ring Mur­ray, 2003’s Lost In Trans­la­tion – spoke to the press by video call from her home in New York re­cently.</p>
    <p>The ini­tial spark for On The Rocks was a friend telling her “this story of her spy­ing on her hus­band with her dad, and they were in the bushes and the play­boy fa­ther was giv­ing his point of view” on ro­man­tic re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>“So the start­ing point was think­ing about a fa­ther-daugh­ter buddy movie. And I al­ways loved (1934 com­edy mys­tery film) The Thin Man and this kind of story.” She also wanted to ex­plore dif­fer­ences in how older and younger gen­er­a­tions view ro­man­tic re­la­tion­ships.</p>
    <p>“And look­ing at your par­ents and your re­la­tion­ships at this mo­ment in my life, hav­ing lit­tle kids, and how that af­fects you,” says the 49-year-old. She is mar­ried to French mu­si­cian Thomas Mars, 43, and has two daugh­ters aged 10 and 13.</p>
    <p>Other ma­jor sources of in­spi­ra­tion were the chats she had with her fa­ther and his friends, who would dis­sect her early ro­man­tic re­la­tion­ships from a very dif­fer­ent and prag­matic per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>“I re­mem­ber at dif­fer­ent points of my life, in my 20s, my dad and his pals chim­ing in with ad­vice about re­la­tion­ships and men. And it’s al­ways interestin­g to hear his point of view be­cause it’s so dif­fer­ent from what friends of your gen­er­a­tion or your girl­friends will tell you.”</p>
    <p>This is her most per­sonal film to date, adds Cop­pola, who won the Cannes Film Fes­ti­val’s Best Di­rec­tor hon­our for pe­riod drama The Beguiled (2017).</p>
    <p>“When­ever I write an orig­i­nal screen­play in­stead of adapt­ing, it’s al­ways more per­sonal, in the same way my two pre­vi­ous orig­i­nal scripts are,” says the film-maker, whose ac­claimed Lost In Trans­la­tion was also some­what au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal.</p>
    <p>“It’s re­flect­ing what I was think­ing about in my life at this mo­ment. And I just looked at my notes and re­alised I started work­ing on this seven years ago. I didn’t re­alise I’d been think­ing about it for so long,” she adds.</p>
    <p>“Es­pe­cially when my kids were lit­tle. It’s just that tran­si­tion of how to be a cre­ative per­son and then have this new role.”</p>
    <p>The film re­unites her with Mur­ray, 70, the beloved comedic star of Ghost­busters (1984) and Ground­hog Day (1993), who earned a Best Ac­tor Os­car nom­i­na­tion for his more dra­matic turn in Lost In Trans­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Work­ing with him was dif­fer­ent this time round. “I know him more now and we’re friends. When I first worked with him, I was just start­ing out and it was a lit­tle in­tim­i­dat­ing.”</p>
    <p>Just like be­fore, the ac­tor man­ages to put his quirky stamp on the char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>“It’s al­ways fun to see what he comes up with, be­cause he’s so imag­i­na­tive and he has so much heart.”</p>
    <p>Mur­ray also has a rep­u­ta­tion as a charmer in real life.</p>
    <p>Re­fer­ring to a scene where he sweet-talks a po­lice of­fi­cer who has pulled him over for driv­ing reck­lessly, Cop­pola says: “I’ve heard friends of Bill say, ‘ Yeah, that’s hap­pened.’”</p>
    <p>She adds: “There are those char­ac­ters who just carry them­selves like they’re the mayor of wher­ever they are, and his char­ac­ter in the film is that kind of guy.”</p>
