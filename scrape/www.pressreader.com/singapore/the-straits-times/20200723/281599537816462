    <p>Quincy Quek is among a host of dis­ap­pointed Asian golfers after this sea­son’s al­ready post­poned PGA Tour Se­ries-China was can­celled yesterday ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old, Sin­ga­pore’s top-ranked golfer, has played only one event this year, miss­ing the cut on home ground in Jan­uary.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sional golf in Asia re­ceived its lat­est set­back yesterday when this sea­son’s PGA Tour SeriesChin­a was can­celled ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>While the US-based PGA Tour is in full swing, al­beit without fans, and the Euro­pean Tour re­sumed yesterday with the Bri­tish Mas­ters, the ma­jor cir­cuits in Asia have yet to restart.</p>
    <p>The Asian Tour is aim­ing to restart in Septem­ber, the same time­line for the lu­cra­tive main tours in Ja­pan and South Korea.</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore’s No. 1 golfer Quincy Quek, who is the coun­try’s sole rep­re­sen­ta­tive on the PGA Tour Se­ries-China, in which he won his maiden ti­tle last year, the news was dis­ap­point­ing.</p>
    <p>But he added that he “ap­pre­ci­ated they have com­mit­ted to a de­ci­sion early rather than leave us hang­ing”.</p>
    <p>His mem­ber­ship and play­ing sta­tus will be car­ried for­ward au­to­mat­i­cally to next year.</p>
    <p>This term’s 14-tour­na­ment com­pe­ti­tion was orig­i­nally sched­uled to start in March but was post­poned due to the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Be­sides de­cent prize purses – rang­ing from 1.5 to 2 mil­lion yuan (S$300,000 to S$400,000) – the top five on the or­der of merit qual­ify di­rectly for the Korn Ferry Tour, which is the feeder cir­cuit into the PGA Tour where the likes of Tiger Woods and Rory McIl­roy com­pete.</p>
    <p>Quek, 33, fin­ished 12th in last year’s PGA Tour Se­ries-China stand­ings and earned 437,320 yuan. He col­lected an­other US$12,700 (S$17,580) on the sec­ond-tier Asian De­vel­op­ment Tour (ADT).</p>
    <p>A missed cut at the Sin­ga­pore Open in Jan­uary was his sole com­pet­i­tive out­ing this cam­paign.</p>
    <p>The world No. 538’s main source of in­come this year has been pri­vate coach­ing. He was giv­ing lessons at Na­tional Ser­vice Re­sort and Coun­try Club be­fore the cir­cuit breaker and con­tin­ued when Phase Two of the econ­omy’s re­open­ing be­gan last month.</p>
    <p>He was cau­tiously op­ti­mistic about the Asian Tour’s restart plans, which suf­fered a blow last week when the Sept 17-20 Tai­wan Mas­ters was can­celled. The US$950,000 event was the sec­ond of three tour­na­ments an­nounced in June to get the dis­rupted sea­son back on track after a six-month sus­pen­sion.</p>
    <p>The Tour staged four events be­fore the cam­paign was halted in March. It hopes to re­turn at the US$1.18 mil­lion Shin­han Dong­hae Open in South Korea from Sept 10 to 13, fol­lowed by the US$1.4 mil­lion Pana­sonic Open in Ja­pan from Sept 24 to 27.</p>
    <p>As for the PGA Tour Se­ries-China, its ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Greg Carl­son hopes the global pan­demic “al­le­vi­ates it­self so we can again re­sume tour­na­ment golf in this part of the world in 2021”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Like with the Macken­zie Tour-PGA Tour Canada, there was so much grow­ing un­cer­tainty in China with get­ting into the coun­try and all the things as­so­ci­ated with trav­el­ling there.</p>
    <p>“We looked at many dif­fer­ent options and sched­ul­ing models that might have al­lowed us to even play an ab­bre­vi­ated sched­ule, and it turned out to not be fea­si­ble.”</p>
