    <p>A re­cent spate of job post­ings by Tesla for roles based in Sin­ga­pore sig­nals the re­turn of the Amer­i­can elec­tric car­maker – an in­ten­tion The Straits Times first re­ported in 2016.</p>
    <p>But for the motoring pub­lic at large, what does the im­mi­nent ar­rival of Tesla sig­nal?</p>
    <p>First, a bit of his­tory. Tesla, led by the enig­matic bil­lion­aire Elon Musk, was first here in 2010. But in Fe­bru­ary 2011, it packed up and left – just six months af­ter set­ting up an of­fice here and, yes, hir­ing staff – with­out sell­ing a single car.</p>
    <p>It had failed to se­cure a spe­cial tax break which would have made its costly Road­ster – it had only one model back then – more vi­able. With­out the break, the Road­ster would have cost around half a mil­lion dol­lars – equiv­a­lent to two units of Lo­tus Elise, the car it was based on.</p>
    <p>And of course we have all read about Mr Musk’s tweets ac­cus­ing Sin­ga­pore of be­ing un­sup­port­ive of elec­tric cars. The first one was posted in mid-2018, fol­lowed by an­other early last year.</p>
    <p>Then in Au­gust last year, Mr Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli, the En­vi­ron­ment and Wa­ter Re­sources</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter then, said in an in­ter­view that Tesla cars are not about cli­mate change, but lifestyle. In other words, we do not need Tesla cars to go green here.</p>
    <p>But ear­lier this year, the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced a num­ber of tax changes which would make elec­tric ve­hi­cles (EVs) more palat­able. Th­ese in­clude an EV Early Adop­tion In­cen­tive which would grant up to $20,000 off an elec­tric car’s Ad­di­tional Regis­tra­tion Fee (its main tax com­po­nent) from Jan 1 next year.</p>
    <p>The road tax cal­cu­la­tion for elec­tric cars has been tweaked too, which re­duces the an­nual levy on a high-pow­ered model such as the Porsche Tay­can by around 25 per cent. (The Tay­can’s road tax would, how­ever, still be higher than that of an equiv­a­lent com­bus­tion en­gine car.)</p>
    <p>Else­where, a car­rot-and-stick scheme has been ex­tended to en­cour­age fleet own­ers to go for greener com­mer­cial ve­hi­cles. The big­gest car­rot goes to elec­tric work ve­hi­cles, which Tesla has in its pipe­line.</p>
    <p>Th­ese changes would be suf­fi­ciently mean­ing­ful for mass-mar­ket EVs such as the Hyundai Kona Elec­tric or MG ZS. But they would make only a mi­nor dent on prices and own­er­ship costs of mod­els such as the Tesla</p>
    <p>Model S and Model X.</p>
    <p>For Mr Musk to de­cide to re­turn now – more than four years af­ter say­ing he would – it prob­a­bly means more changes are afoot.</p>
    <p>The most sig­nif­i­cant change may well lie in the Ve­hic­u­lar Emis­sions Scheme (VES). The cur­rent scheme ex­pires at the end of this year and a new one will be an­nounced soon. There is a chance that the new VES will sweeten the EV deal fur­ther.</p>
    <p>If so, it would make sense for Tesla to be hir­ing now and be in time to set up shop to take ad­van­tage of all the new tax changes.</p>
    <p>With­out th­ese changes, Tesla is highly un­likely to suc­ceed here, go­ing by sales of grey-im­ported prod­ucts. There are only 21 Tes­las here as of end-2019, out of 1,120 elec­tric cars on the road.</p>
    <p>An­other fac­tor which would align the stars for Mr Musk is Tesla’s own prod­uct line-up. The com­pany’s lat­est Model 3 is a less costly model, which would be fol­lowed by the Model Y next year .</p>
    <p>Its new pro­duc­tion fa­cil­ity in China will also make it more eco­nom­i­cal to sup­ply ve­hi­cles to the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion, shield­ing it from any crip­pling tar­iff which might arise from the on­go­ing United States-China trade war.</p>
    <p>The grow­ing EV pub­lic charg­ing net­work here is also a pos­i­tive de­vel­op­ment, although most Tesla buy­ers are likely to live in landed prop­er­ties and have their own charg­ers.</p>
    <p>But any de­vel­op­ment which favours Tesla will favour all con­sumers who would like to buy an EV but are put off by the ex­or­bi­tant costs. And the ma­jor­ity do not live in landed homes.</p>
    <p>Tesla’s ar­rival will also mean those who have placed de­posits for a Model 3 since 2016 will at long last be able to get their cars.</p>
    <p>But it’s not-so-good news for Tesla grey im­porters, who source their cars from over­seas buy­ers. Their prices will im­me­di­ately be­come un­com­pet­i­tive once Tesla sets up its own re­tail out­fit here.</p>
    <p>For mo­torists, Tesla’s ar­rival marks more than a sym­bolic turn­ing point.</p>
    <p>Whether you like him or not, Mr Musk has forced the au­to­mo­tive world to play catch-up in the elec­tri­fi­ca­tion race. His brand gels with Sin­ga­pore’s aim to phase out all ve­hi­cles run­ning solely on com­bus­tion en­gines by 2040.</p>
    <p>His “just do it” ap­proach to tech­nol­ogy is also in line with our smart city ini­tia­tives and a les­son for those here who pre­fer only tried-and-tested sys­tems.</p>
    <p>All th­ese are as­sum­ing Tesla is re­turn­ing. The com­pany and Mr Musk have re­mained un­con­tactable since 2017, so there is no of­fi­cial word.</p>
    <p>But if it does re­turn, let’s hope it stays a bit longer this time.</p>
