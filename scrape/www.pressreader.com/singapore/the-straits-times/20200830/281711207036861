    <p>Some for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers are fac­ing dis­rupted so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties from this week­end and are not able to meet up with their friends at their usual haunts, as new en­try re­stric­tions at two malls pop­u­lar with such work­ers kicked in yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Among those for whom much of the buzz has been taken away is Filip­ina do­mes­tic worker Lu­div­ina El­lorengco, who is a fre­quent vis­i­tor to Lucky Plaza in Or­chard Road.</p>
    <p>New rules to re­duce over­crowd­ing on week­ends meant the usu­ally thriv­ing Or­chard Road mall was much qui­eter when she dropped in yes­ter­day. The re­stric­tions – which also ap­ply at Penin­sula Plaza in North Bridge Road – al­low en­try for peo­ple with iden­ti­fi­ca­tion card num­bers end­ing with an odd digit on odd dates; those with num­bers end­ing with an even digit can enter only on even dates.</p>
    <p>“All my friends’ (iden­ti­fi­ca­tion card num­bers end in) even dig­its, so I can’t meet them here,” said Ms El­lorengco, 35, who has been work­ing in Sin­ga­pore for five years.</p>
    <p>Ms Glyda Lopez, 34, is an­other fan of Lucky Plaza. She usu­ally spends her reg­u­lar Satur­days off there meet­ing friends and buy­ing clothes and food, as well as to eat at pop­u­lar Philip­pine fast-food chain Jol­libee.</p>
    <p>Her em­ployer des­ig­nated Sat­ur­day as her day off, as malls like Lucky Plaza are busier on Sun­days.</p>
    <p>“Some of my friends don’t come (to Lucky Plaza) when they’re off; they go to parks and open ar­eas like Botanic Gar­dens and East Coast Park,” Ms Lopez said.</p>
    <p>Ms Aye Aye Than, 35, used to meet friends at Penin­sula Plaza on al­ter­nate Sun­days, but that changed with the Covid-19 out­break.</p>
    <p>Her em­ployer has told her to avoid crowded places when she goes out, al­though they have come to a com­pro­mise by shift­ing her day off to Satur­days, when Penin­sula Plaza is less busy.</p>
    <p>“It’s nice to be able to come here and shop on week­ends, but it’s hard to meet friends be­cause most of them are only off on Sun­day,” said Ms Aye Aye Than.</p>
    <p>Her em­ployer, lo­gis­tics ex­ec­u­tive Kelvin Yeow, said: “It’s a good thing her card num­ber ends with an odd num­ber, so we can still ar­range for her to have her day off on Sat­ur­day (this week). Of course, we’d pre­fer if she avoids crowded places if pos­si­ble, and hope­fully the stag­gered en­try days will mean smaller crowds.”</p>
    <p>Other vis­i­tors The Sun­day Times spoke to yes­ter­day were not reg­u­lar pa­trons of ei­ther shop­ping cen­tre, but were there to run er­rands.</p>
    <p>A 44-year-old Filip­ina maid who wanted to be known only as Susie was send­ing a pack­age, which in­cluded a lap­top, back to her family in the Philip­pines, as she was not able to make her usual trip home last month due to the out­break.</p>
    <p>House­wife Ch­eryl Li, 57, was re­mit­ting money on be­half of her par­ents’ maid at Lucky Plaza. “Her (iden­ti­fi­ca­tion card) ends in an odd num­ber, but be­cause they’re old and not in the best of health, we feel it’s safer if their helper avoids go­ing to crowded places for now in case she gets in­fected,” Ms Li said.</p>
    <p>Shop own­ers at Lucky Plaza and Penin­sula Plaza said crowds were sig­nif­i­cantly down yes­ter­day com­pared with previous week­ends.</p>
    <p>Hair salon owner Jackie Yang, 58, said it was even qui­eter yes­ter­day than on Friday. “A few of my cus­tomers came (on Friday) be­cause they’re not able to come (yes­ter­day), and Sun­day would be quite crowded.”</p>
    <p>Mrs Yang, who has been op­er­at­ing her salon in Lucky Plaza for about a decade, was con­cerned about the slow foot traf­fic, es­pe­cially as rents re­main un­changed.</p>
    <p>Ms Iris Htet En­gine Thant, 21, whose mother owns gro­cery shop Ngwe Thaw Dar at Penin­sula Plaza, said that while the mall was qui­eter than usual yes­ter­day, it tends to be busier for them on Sun­days.</p>
    <p>But the shop is find­ing new ways of mak­ing sure that sales are not af­fected, she said.</p>
    <p>“We do pro­vide home de­liv­ery and have started sell­ing on on­line plat­forms like Shopee. Cus­tomers can also ar­range to pick up their items from out­side the shop­ping cen­tre, if they are not the right num­ber for that day,” Ms Iris added.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board and En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore said Lucky Plaza and Penin­sula Plaza were tak­ing a “more ad­vi­sory ap­proach” this week­end given that it was the early</p>
    <p>Some of my friends don’t come (to Lucky Plaza) when they’re off; they go to parks and open ar­eas like Botanic Gar­dens and East Coast Park.</p>

    <p>“The de­ploy­ment of safe-dis­tanc­ing am­bas­sadors has been ramped up at both malls to man­age crowds and en­sure proper im­ple­men­ta­tion of the en­try re­stric­tions,” the two agen­cies said in a statement.</p>
