    <p>It’s no sur­prise many of us are stressed given the way the pan­demic has put jobs at risk and forced peo­ple to dras­ti­cally change where and how they work, but there are ways to cope.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edge that you are stressed and then take steps to look af­ter your well-be­ing. Here are five tips:</p>
    <p>1. PRAC­TISE SELF-CARE</p>
    <p>Adopt a healthy life­style with a bal­anced diet and ad­e­quate sleep and ex­er­cise, says Dr Seng Kok Han, a con­sul­tant psy­chi­a­trist at No­bel Psy­cho­log­i­cal Well­ness Cen­tre.</p>
    <p>Iden­tify neg­a­tive thoughts that can be ir­ra­tional, change them to help­ful ones and fo­cus on what you can do to im­prove sit­u­a­tions. But be re­al­is­tic and learn to ac­cept what you can­not change, he adds.</p>
    <p>“Sup­port oth­ers within your ca­pac­ity, such as by check­ing on them and pro­vid­ing a lis­ten­ing ear... Af­ter all, al­tru­ism is known to be an ef­fec­tive cop­ing mech­a­nism,” he says.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Hu­man Re­sources In­sti­tute pres­i­dent Low Peck Kem rec­om­mends in­vest­ing in build­ing re­la­tion­ships and hav­ing en­gag­ing con­ver­sa­tions with col­leagues and bosses, es­pe­cially when work­ing re­motely.</p>
    <p>It takes more ef­fort to con­sciously “meet” when work­ing from home in­stead of in the of­fice, so con­sider sched­ul­ing such so­cial in­ter­ac­tions into your cal­en­dar, she says.</p>
    <p>2. SET BOUND­ARIES BE­TWEEN WORK AND REST IF WORK­ING FROM HOME</p>
    <p>Stick to a rou­tine that mir­rors your reg­u­lar of­fice day. This helps pro­vide struc­ture even if your per­sonal and work spa­ces have merged, says Dr Seng.</p>
    <p>There is no need to feel guilty about not re­spond­ing to non-ur­gent work texts and e-mails af­ter of­fice hours.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should re­spect such bound­aries and not hold meet­ings out­side work­day hours just be­cause ev­ery­one can at­tend them re­motely.</p>
    <p>3. CRE­ATE A CON­DUCIVE WORKSPACE WHERE POS­SI­BLE</p>
    <p>Re­mote work­ing is likely to re­main the norm for many peo­ple, so make your work­place con­ducive by de­clut­ter­ing and be­ing or­gan­ised, says Dr Seng.</p>
    <p>If pos­si­ble, cre­ate sep­a­rate phys­i­cal spa­ces for tak­ing work and so­cial calls to dif­fer­en­ti­ate be­tween these as­pects of your life.</p>
    <p>Dr Seng rec­om­mends hav­ing ground rules in your home for work and com­mu­ni­cat­ing these clearly to fam­ily mem­bers.</p>
    <p>If all these do not help, try hav­ing an hon­est con­ver­sa­tion with your man­ager to work out al­ter­na­tive ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>4. EM­PLOY­ERS CAN PLAY A PART</p>
    <p>Or­gan­i­sa­tions are com­ing up with more novel ways to in­tro­duce men­tal well­ness pro­grammes even in the vir­tual work­place, says Ms Low. These in­clude art ther­apy, work­out classes, men­tal well­ness we­bi­nars and pro­fes­sional coun­selling ses­sions.</p>
    <p>Bosses should also en­gage more of­ten with em­ploy­ees and cre­ate a buddy sys­tem to en­cour­age staff to check in with one an­other, adds Ms Low.</p>
    <p>Men­tal health ad­vo­cate and former nom­i­nated MP Anthea Ong calls on em­ploy­ers to re­frame the work­place “not as the cause of men­tal ills but as a source of pos­i­tive men­tal well-be­ing”.</p>
    <p>This means proac­tively sup­port­ing em­ploy­ees in the dif­fer­ent roles that they play out­side of work, such as in the fam­ily or com­mu­nity, so that they are in the pink of health men­tally be­cause of their time at work and in the work­place.</p>
    <p>She cites a multi­na­tional en­ergy firm that started pro­vid­ing work­shops on home­school­ing skills as well as coun­selling sup­port for staff with young chil­dren when schools moved to home-based learn­ing. The firm plans to con­tinue of­fer­ing par­ent­ing pro­grammes be­yond Covid-19.</p>
    <p>An­other global con­sult­ing com­pany has also im­ple­mented sup­port struc­tures for em­ploy­ees who are care­givers of se­niors with spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>Ms Ong sug­gests that bosses share hon­estly with work­ers about their own men­tal health dif­fi­cul­ties, which not only builds trust and breaks the stigma around these is­sues, but also helps the bosses be­come more at ease with who they are.</p>
    <p>5. SEEK PRO­FES­SIONAL HELP IF NEEDED</p>
    <p>Dr Seng notes that ev­ery cri­sis can be an op­por­tu­nity to be­come even more re­silient to­wards stress.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if anx­i­ety symp­toms are pro­longed, ex­ces­sive and out of pro­por­tion, they can cause dis­abil­ity and lead to emo­tional prob­lems and de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>Dr Seng ad­vises that in such sce­nar­ios, it is im­por­tant to seek pro­fes­sional help.</p>
