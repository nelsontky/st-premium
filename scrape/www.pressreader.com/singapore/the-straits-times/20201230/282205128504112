    <p>MUM­BAI • Mukesh Am­bani spent much of the year con­vinc­ing Face­book, Google and a clutch of Wall Street heavy­weights to buy into his vi­sion for one of the world’s most am­bi­tious cor­po­rate trans­for­ma­tions.</p>
    <p>Now flush with US$27 bil­lion (S$35.9 bil­lion) in fresh cap­i­tal, Asia’s rich­est man is un­der pres­sure to de­liver.</p>
    <p>The 63-year-old In­dian ty­coon is fo­cused on a hand­ful of pri­or­i­ties as he tries to turn Re­liance In­dus­tries from an old-econ­omy con­glom­er­ate into a tech­nol­ogy and ecom­merce ti­tan, ac­cord­ing to re­cent pub­lic state­ments and peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the com­pany’s plans.</p>
    <p>These in­clude de­vel­op­ing prod­ucts for the an­tic­i­pated roll-out next year of a lo­cal 5G net­work; in­cor­po­rat­ing Face­book’s What­sApp pay­ments service into Re­liance’s dig­i­tal plat­form; and in­te­grat­ing the com­pany’s e-com­merce of­fer­ings with a net­work of phys­i­cal mom-and-pop shops across the coun­try. Mr Am­bani is also push­ing for­ward with plans to sell a stake in Re­liance’s oil and petro­chem­i­cal units, a deal he had orig­i­nally hoped would re­duce debt and fi­nance his high-tech pivot ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>EV­ERY MOVE</p>
    <p>In­vestors are watch­ing his ev­ery move as he over­hauls his em­pire – with a mar­ket value of US$179 bil­lion – in the mid­dle of a pan­demic, wad­ing into highly com­pet­i­tive in­dus­tries and tak­ing on ri­vals from Ama­zon.com to Wal­mart. Re­liance shares rose as much as 55 per cent this year to an all-time high in Septem­ber, but they have since pared gains as stake­hold­ers look for more ev­i­dence that Mr Am­bani can ex­e­cute.</p>
    <p>While Mr Am­bani has pub­licly em­braced his new part­ner­ships with i nvestors i nclud­ing Face­book, the ty­coon’s fund-rais­ing spree was ini­tially meant to be more of a Plan B. His orig­i­nal goal was to sell a 20 per cent stake in Re­liance’s oil and petro­chem­i­cals divi­sion to Saudi Ara­bian Oil at an en­ter­prise value of US$75 bil­lion, im­ply­ing a US$15 bil­lion val­u­a­tion for the stake.</p>
    <p>The Aramco deal, first an­nounced in Au­gust last year, was sup­posed to help him de­liver on a pledge to get rid of his com­pany’s US$22 bil­lion in net debt in 18 months.</p>
    <p>But as talks with the Saudis stalled, Re­liance in­vestors grew more anx­ious. The stock tum­bled more than 40 per cent in the three months to March 23.</p>
    <p>HIT A WALL</p>
    <p>Mr Am­bani, who had be­gun ex­plor­ing stake sales in his dig­i­tal ser­vices and re­tail units months ear­lier, de­cided to ac­cel­er­ate those talks after the Aramco deal hit a wall, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said.</p>
    <p>The re­sponse from in­vestors ex­ceeded the com­pany’s ex­pec­ta­tions, one of the peo­ple said, with big-name back­ers in­clud­ing KKR & Co, Sil­ver Lake and Mubadala In­vest­ment com­mit­ting more than US$20 bil­lion to the dig­i­tal busi­ness and US$6.4 bil­lion to re­tail. Re­liance de­clared it­self free of net debt in June and its shares surged.</p>
    <p>At the com­pany’s an­nual share­holder meet­ing in July, Mr Am­bani and his el­dest chil­dren Isha and Akash sketched out the broad thrust of their high-tech am­bi­tions. Among the new ser­vices they touted was a 5G wire­less net­work as early as next year and a video-stream­ing plat­form that will bring Net­flix, Dis­ney+ Hot­star, Ama­zon Prime Video and dozens of TV chan­nels un­der one um­brella.</p>
    <p>Re­liance’s dig­i­tal unit, Jio Plat­forms, will also de­velop a port­fo­lio of tech­nol­ogy so­lu­tions and apps for In­dia’s mil­lions of mi­cro, small and medium-sized busi­nesses, Mr Am­bani said, adding that he plans to even­tu­ally ex­pand the plat­form over­seas.</p>
    <p>“The time has come for a truly global dig­i­tal prod­uct and ser­vices com­pany to emerge from In­dia,” he told share­hold­ers.</p>
    <p>The com­pany’s big­gest pri­or­ity for next year is 5G, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said. While reg­u­la­tors have yet to auc­tion rights to In­dia’s next-gen­er­a­tion air­waves, Mr Am­bani said this month that his com­pany “will pi­o­neer the 5G rev­o­lu­tion in In­dia in the sec­ond half of 2021”.</p>
    <p>US$54 SMART­PHONE</p>
    <p>Re­liance is plan­ning to show­case its line-up of 5G prod­ucts at next year’s share­holder meet­ing, which typ­i­cally takes place some time be­tween July and Septem­ber, one of the peo­ple said. The com­pany is also work­ing with Google on an An­droid-based US$54 smart­phone, part of the strat­egy to get more Indians to use mo­bile data for ser­vices in­clud­ing stream­ing video, on­line games and shop­ping.</p>
    <p>Re­liance views the in­te­gra­tion with What­sApp’s re­cently ap­proved pay­ments sys­tem as a cru­cial step in the de­vel­op­ment of its on­line shop­ping ser­vices, the peo­ple said. The com­pa­nies are work­ing to­gether as Re­liance’s e-com­merce plat­forms look to tap hun­dreds of mil­lions of Face­book, What­sApp and In­sta­gram users. Mr Am­bani’s big­gest chal­lenge now is to earn a re­turn on these in­vest­ments, said Mr James Crab­tree, au­thor of The Bil­lion­aire Raj: A Jour­ney Through In­dia’s New Gilded Age.</p>
    <p>‘KEY MAN’ RISK</p>
    <p>There’s also the chal­lenge of “key man” risk. Mr Am­bani – the face of Re­liance – isn’t get­ting any younger. While the com­pany has not pub­licly dis­closed a suc­ces­sion plan, In­dia’s Mint news­pa­per re­ported in Au­gust that the ty­coon, whose net worth is about US$77 bil­lion, is set­ting up a fam­ily coun­cil and aims to com­plete suc­ces­sion plan­ning by the end of next year.</p>
    <p>“Any large, sin­gle-pil­lar ed­i­fice has ma­jor in­her­ent risks,” said Pro­fes­sor Kavil Ra­machan­dran, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Thomas Sch­mid­heiny Cen­tre for Fam­ily En­ter­prise at the In­dian School of Busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Mr Am­bani’s sup­port­ers point to his re­cent track record of dis­rup­tion. He fa­mously up­ended In­dia’s telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions in­dus­try four years ago by of­fer­ing free calls and cheap data, push­ing some ri­vals into bank­ruptcy.</p>
    <p>“Mukesh has been a big part of this wave of in­no­va­tion,” said Mr Sun­dar Pichai, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Al­pha­bet, which owns Google. “His vi­sion and fo­cus of a fu­ture where ev­ery In­dian can ben­e­fit from the op­por­tu­ni­ties tech­nol­ogy cre­ates is re­ally ex­cit­ing to us and we are glad to be a part­ner in that work.”</p>
    <p>While Mr Mukesh Am­bani has pub­licly em­braced his new part­ner­ships with in­vestors in­clud­ing Face­book, the ty­coon’s fund-rais­ing spree was ini­tially meant to be more of a Plan B. His orig­i­nal goal was to sell a 20 per cent stake in Re­liance’s oil and petro­chem­i­cals divi­sion to Saudi Ara­bian Oil, at an en­ter­prise value of US$75 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$99.5 bil­lion), im­ply­ing a US$15 bil­lion val­u­a­tion for the stake.</p>
