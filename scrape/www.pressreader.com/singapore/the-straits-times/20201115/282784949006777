    <p>Golden State War­riors owner Joe La­cob is will­ing to pay the price to bring fans to Chase Cen­tre dur­ing the 2020-21 Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) reg­u­lar sea­son.</p>
    <p>His plan to al­low fans in the new San Fran­cisco home arena of the War­riors in­cludes rapid test­ing at a cost of about US$30 mil­lion (S$40.4 mil­lion). The plan calls for the new in­door fa­cil­ity to op­er­ate at 50 per cent ca­pac­ity for 2020-21.</p>
    <p>State and lo­cal of­fi­cials heard La­cob’s pitch be­fore the cur­rent 14-day travel shut­down was an­nounced on Thurs­day night.</p>
    <p>The plan, cre­ated i n March when the NBA shut down due to Covid-19, is in­ter­nally known as</p>
    <p>“Oper­a­tion Dub Na­tion”.</p>
    <p>The NBA is permitting teams to dis­cuss at­ten­dance plans and pro­to­col with their state and lo­cal of­fi­cials, but no fi­nal de­ci­sion at the league level on at­ten­dance poli­cies has been fully ap­proved.</p>
    <p>The NBA lost more than US$1 bil­lion in rev­enue last sea­son with­out fans for the fi­nal weeks of the reg­u­lar sea­son and play-offs, held in the“bub­ble” near Or­lando.</p>
    <p>“We’re go­ing to lose a lot of money,” La­cob told Bay Area News Group. “But it’s the right thing to do.”</p>
    <p>La­cob, a UCLA masters grad­u­ate in pub­lic health (epi­demi­ol­ogy), said ev­ery player, em­ployee and fan would be tested us­ing the most ac­cu­rate test on the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“I not only want to get this done and show the world how we can do it now, I’m will­ing to spend the money to do it,” the ven­ture cap­i­tal­ist said in an ESPN in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“You can­not sus­tain this league with no fans. You can do it for a year. We’ll all get by for a year. But sup­pose we’re in this sit­u­a­tion next year. Now we’re talk­ing some se­ri­ous, se­ri­ous fi­nan­cial dam­age to a lot of peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>Rapid PCR, or poly­merase chain re­ac­tion, tests or equiv­a­lent tests mea­sure the ge­netic ma­te­rial of the virus.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics pointed to eth­i­cal is­sues, in­clud­ing claim­ing large numbers of rapid tests that could other­wise go to at-risk seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion, nurs­ing homes, health­care work­ers and more.</p>
    <p>The NBA and MLB (Ma­jor League Base­ball) used rapid test­ing dur­ing the 2020 sea­sons, but of­ten re­sults were only avail­able overnight.</p>
    <p>La­cob said the lat­est test pro­duces “ac­cu­rate re­sults within 15 min­utes”. Cal­i­for­nia has not ap­proved fan at­ten­dance at any ca­pac­ity but the 64-year-old be­lieves his own back­ground and ex­per­tise can be the dif­fer­ence in get­ting ap­proval on all fronts.</p>
    <p>“Let us prove the con­cept. Let us use our money, our re­sources, our seven-eight months of work, our ex­per­tise to prove the con­cept,” he said. “That’s what I’m try­ing to get the state, the city and the gov­ern­ment to en­ter­tain.”</p>
