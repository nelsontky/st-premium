    <p>A maid who wanted to work for another house­hold de­lib­er­ately dipped the hand of her em­ployer’s 16-month-old baby girl into a pot of hot wa­ter af­ter learn­ing she would have to in­cur costs for a trans­fer.</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old Myan­mar na­tional, who can­not be named to pro­tect the girl’s iden­tity, was yes­ter­day sen­tenced to 14 months’ jail af­ter plead­ing guilty to one count of us­ing a heated sub­stance to vol­un­tar­ily cause hurt.</p>
    <p>The maid started work­ing for the fam­ily on Dec 8 last year.</p>
    <p>Her job scope in­cluded house­keep­ing and cook­ing, as well as tak­ing care of the baby and her eight-yearold sis­ter. Af­ter two weeks, the maid de­cided she wanted to work else­where as she did not know how to care for the baby.</p>
    <p>She ap­proached her agency, but when she learnt that she had to pay for a trans­fer, she con­tin­ued work­ing for the fam­ily. Court doc­u­ments did not state the costs in­volved.</p>
    <p>The maid was cook­ing chicken curry on Jan 14 this year at the fam­ily flat near Hougang when the baby started cry­ing at around 5.15pm. She car­ried the baby in her arms and con­tin­ued cook­ing.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Jane</p>
    <p>Lim said: “While the ac­cused was car­ry­ing the vic­tim, she felt ag­i­tated and moved the vic­tim’s left hand to­wards the pot con­tain­ing hot wa­ter, which was on a stove that was turned on, caus­ing the vic­tim’s left hand to come into con­tact with the pot and hot wa­ter two to three times, with the knowl­edge that she was likely to cause hurt to the vic­tim.”</p>
    <p>A closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion (CCTV) cam­era in the flat cap­tured the maid com­mit­ting the of­fence.</p>
    <p>The vic­tim’s sis­ter stepped out of the bath­room when she heard the baby cry, but the maid claimed the child had placed her hand in­side the pot.</p>
    <p>The older girl phoned their fa­ther, who ad­vised her to ap­ply some aloe vera and tooth­paste on the burn.</p>
    <p>He re­turned home at around 6.40pm and took the baby to a clinic af­ter see­ing the ex­tent of her in­juries. The child was then re­ferred to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal, where she was di­ag­nosed with sec­ond-de­gree burns on her left hand.</p>
    <p>The Myan­mar na­tional ini­tially lied to the girls’ par­ents when they ques­tioned her, claim­ing that the baby had ac­ci­den­tally touched the pot on the stove.</p>
    <p>But the fa­ther be­came sus­pi­cious the next day when the maid said that she wanted to stop work­ing for the house­hold.</p>
    <p>He viewed the CCTV clip with his wife and saw the maid com­mit­ting the of­fence.</p>
    <p>The girls’ mother then alerted the po­lice at around 11am on Jan 15.</p>
