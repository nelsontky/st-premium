    <p>Sur­bana Jurong’s board of di­rec­tors has ac­cepted the res­ig­na­tion of Mr Liew Mun Leong as chair­man, but did not name a suc­ces­sor.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment last night, the con­sult­ing firm’s group chief ex­ec­u­tive Wong Heang Fine said: “While the change in chair­man­ship has taken place un­ex­pect­edly, the board, man­age­ment and global work­force of Sur­bana Jurong have the col­lec­tive re­solve to carry on with busi­ness as usual.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing we have achieved thus far serves as a solid foun­da­tion to ad­vance our work as a tech­ni­cal plat­form for cre­at­ing a smart, sus­tain­able and re­silient built en­vi­ron­ment.”</p>
    <p>He added that Sur­bana Jurong re­mains fo­cused on its clients and sup­port­ing them in their plans for a post-Covid-19 fu­ture.</p>
    <p>Mr Liew, 74, re­signed from his posts in Sur­bana Jurong – an in­fra­struc­ture and ser­vices com­pany – and three other or­gan­i­sa­tions on Thurs­day af­ter the High Court ac­quit­ted his former maid of theft and ques­tioned his mo­ti­va­tion in lodg­ing a po­lice re­port against her, spark­ing an on­line back­lash.</p>
    <p>He stepped down as chair­man of Changi Air­port Group and Sur­bana Jurong, and from his po­si­tions as se­nior in­ter­na­tional busi­ness ad­viser at Sin­ga­pore in­vest­ment firm Te­masek and as a board mem­ber of Te­masek Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>An­nounc­ing his de­ci­sion to “bring for­ward” his re­tire­ment, Mr</p>
    <p>Liew said at the time that he did not want his cur­rent sit­u­a­tion to be a dis­trac­tion to the or­gan­i­sa­tions’ re­spec­tive boards, man­age­ment and staff, amid their many crit­i­cal pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>When asked yes­ter­day about who would suc­ceed Mr Liew, Sur­bana said it would make an an­nounce­ment in due course.</p>
    <p>In its state­ment last night, Sur­bana Jurong paid trib­ute to the con­tri­bu­tions made to the firm by Mr Liew, who was its found­ing chair­man from 2015.</p>
    <p>“Un­der his guid­ance, Sur­bana Jurong made a se­ries of trans­for­ma­tive ac­qui­si­tions to forge an in­te­grated tech­ni­cal con­sul­tancy ser­vices plat­form with a com­plete value propo­si­tion for the built en­vi­ron­ment,” it said.</p>
    <p>Aside from this, Sur­bana Jurong said that Mr Liew was “com­mit­ted to build­ing talent” and had made great ef­forts to strengthen its man­age­ment, go­ing so far as to per­son­ally in­ter­view po­ten­tial se­nior man­age­ment can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>“He will al­ways be re­mem­bered for the busi­ness and lead­er­ship lec­tures he de­liv­ered to staff and the Sun­day e-mails he in­vested time to write, a ve­hi­cle for shar­ing his wealth of in­sights and ex­pe­ri­ence,” said Sur­bana Jurong.</p>
    <p>It added: “His im­mea­sur­able con­tri­bu­tions to the group will not be for­got­ten. With deep­est grat­i­tude, we thank Mr Liew for his ser­vice and wish him the very best in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>WEALTH OF IN­SIGHT AND EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>He will al­ways be re­mem­bered for the busi­ness and lead­er­ship lec­tures he de­liv­ered to staff and the Sun­day e-mails he in­vested time to write, a ve­hi­cle for shar­ing his wealth of in­sights and ex­pe­ri­ence.’’</p>
