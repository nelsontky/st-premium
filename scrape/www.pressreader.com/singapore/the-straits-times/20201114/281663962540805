    <p>• China is fac­ing an in­creased risk of lo­cal trans­mis­sion of the coro­n­avirus in the win­ter due to im­ported cases as the spread of the global pan­demic ac­cel­er­ates, a se­nior of­fi­cial at the coun­try’s health author­ity has said.</p>
    <p>In win­ter, there might be spo­radic cases in some ar­eas in China and some pocket clus­ter cases in oth­ers, Dr Li Bin, Vice-Min­is­ter of the Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion (NHC), said at a press con­fer­ence on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“China’s epi­demic preven­tion and con­trol work can­not be re­laxed for a sin­gle mo­ment,” Dr Li said.</p>
    <p>Coun­tries such as In­dia, Brazil and France are re­port­ing tens of thou­sands of new in­fec­tions daily.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, China has largely con­trolled the spread of the coro­n­avirus since early sum­mer, although clus­ters of com­mu­nity in­fec­tions have pe­ri­od­i­cally hit parts of the coun­try, while im­ported cases among trav­ellers ar­riv­ing from abroad have risen.</p>
    <p>Mr Yin Chengji, deputy com­mis­sioner of the Na­tional Immigratio­n Ad­min­is­tra­tion, told re­porters China has con­tin­ued to halt is­su­ing visas to some for­eign na­tion­als while re­strict­ing non-ur­gent out­bound move­ments by Chi­nese ci­ti­zens.</p>
    <p>When asked if China would create so-called travel bub­bles with coun­tries less af­fected by the virus, Mr Luo Zhao­hui, Vice-Min­is­ter of For­eign Af­fairs, said now was not the right time.</p>
    <p>“For closed-loop travel bub­bles we do not deny this pos­si­bil­ity, but we think the con­di­tions are not right yet,” said Mr Luo.</p>
    <p>He also warned Chi­nese ci­ti­zens against out­bound travel.</p>
    <p>“Our advice is do not go over­seas,” Mr Luo said.</p>
    <p>In the past week, a hand­ful of lo­cal cases linked to food im­ports have emerged in the north­ern port city of Tian­jin, while an air­port worker in Shang­hai con­tracted the virus even though he has had no di­rect con­tact with in­fected pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Although the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion says the risk of catch­ing Covid-19 from frozen food is low, China has re­peat­edly sounded alarms af­ter de­tect­ing the virus on pack­ag­ing of prod­ucts rang­ing from Ger­man pork knuck­les to Ecuado­rian shrimp, trig­ger­ing dis­rup­tive im­port bans.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi Kexin, an of­fi­cial at the Gen­eral Ad­min­is­tra­tion of Cus­toms, said at the same press con­fer­ence on Thurs­day that the coun­try has done ran­dom checks on more than 870,000 sam­ples of im­ported frozen food. Im­ports of 99 sup­pli­ers from 20 coun­tries have been sus­pended, ac­cord­ing to the NHC.</p>
    <p>China’s Cus­toms of­fice said yes­ter­day that it will sus­pend im­ports from In­dia’s Basu In­ter­na­tional for one week af­ter de­tect­ing the virus on three sam­ples taken from the outer pack­ag­ing of frozen cut­tle­fish.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese city of Wuhan, where the virus was first de­tected last year, also said it had de­tected</p>
    <p>NOT READY FOR TRAVEL BUB­BLES</p>
    <p>For closed-loop travel bub­bles we do not deny this pos­si­bil­ity, but we think the con­di­tions are not right yet... Our advice is do not go over­seas.</p>
    <p>MR LUO ZHAO­HUI, Vice-Min­is­ter of For­eign Af­fairs, when asked if China would create so-called travel bub­bles with coun­tries less af­fected by the virus. He also warned Chi­nese ci­ti­zens against out­bound travel.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 on the pack­ag­ing of a batch of Brazil­ian beef.</p>
    <p>The beef had en­tered the coun­try at Qing­dao port on Aug 7 and it reached Wuhan on Aug 17, where it re­mained in a cold stor­age fa­cil­ity un­til re­cently.</p>
    <p>China’s tight­ened cold chain guide­lines call for “com­plete elim­i­na­tion” and “strict re­fusal of en­try” of any prod­ucts sus­pected of con­tact with the virus.</p>
    <p>The rules re­quire rou­tine dis­in­fec­tion, in­clud­ing of in­ner and outer pack­ag­ing, and blan­ket test­ing of im­ported goods.</p>
    <p>Al­ready, ex­porters whose prod­ucts tested pos­i­tive faced a week­long ban, ex­tended to a month for third-time of­fend­ers.</p>
    <p>“If it’s con­tam­i­nated they re­turn the whole of the food pack­ag­ing. That’s their right, but I don’t think that’s very nec­es­sary. A de­con­tam­i­na­tion process is al­ready suf­fi­cient”, said Dr Jin Dong-Yan, a vi­rol­ogy pro­fes­sor at the Univer­sity of Hong Kong.</p>
