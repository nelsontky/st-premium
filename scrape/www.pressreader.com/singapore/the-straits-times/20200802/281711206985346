    <p>PARIS • France’s busiest air­port has be­gun test­ing pas­sen­gers for Covid-19 on ar­rival from high-risk coun­tries, a move that could re­duce the need for quar­an­tine mea­sures caus­ing pain to the tourism in­dus­try across Europe.</p>
    <p>Those l and­ing at Charles de Gaulle air­port in Paris from one of 12 coun­tries i den­ti­fied by the French gov­ern­ment will be re­quired to visit the testers who are work­ing out of a makeshift space near the bag­gage re­claim area.</p>
    <p>One worker will record their con­tact de­tails, then di­rect them to a col­league who will in­sert a swab into their nasal pas­sage to gather a sam­ple for test­ing.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers are then al­lowed to con­tinue their jour­ney. Test re­sults will come through be­tween 24 and 48 hours later, when trav­ellers will be con­tacted by pub­lic health work­ers.</p>
    <p>“The test (re­sults) are not avail­able im­me­di­ately. We don’t know if some­one is pos­i­tive or neg­a­tive,” Paris pub­lic hos­pi­tal of­fi­cial Ben­jamin Pau­mier told Reuters at the air­port last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>“But the ob­jec­tive is to fol­low these peo­ple, es­pe­cially those who are pos­i­tive, to fol­low them up, and find out who they’ve been in con­tact with.”</p>
    <p>With fears around Europe of a sec­ond wave of the coron­avirus epi­demic, some gov­ern­ments have ad­vised against travel to high-risk des­ti­na­tions, or told trav­ellers they must quar­an­tine them­selves on their re­turn.</p>
    <p>Mean­while in Greece, maskwear­ing is now com­pul­sory in all in­door pub­lic spa­ces and also in outdoor ar­eas where proper so­cial dis­tanc­ing can­not be ob­served, the au­thor­i­ties said last Fri­day. Rules for bars, beach bars, live-mu­sic venues, bar-restau­rants, cafes and clubs where only seated clients will be al­lowed have also been tight­ened so as to avoid over­crowd­ing.</p>
    <p>In Ber­lin, thou­sands of demon­stra­tors ral­lied yes­ter­day to protest against mea­sures im­posed in Ger­many to stem the coron­avirus pan­demic, say­ing they vi­o­lated peo­ple’s rights and free­doms. Most peo­ple have re­spected mea­sures that in­clude wear­ing face masks in shops. But a vo­cal mi­nor­ity is chaf­ing against the re­stric­tions, say­ing they are crush­ing di­ver­sity of thought.</p>
