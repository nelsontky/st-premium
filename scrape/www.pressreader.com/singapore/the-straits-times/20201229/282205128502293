    <p>Novena Global Health­care’s cred­i­tors have been asked to sub­mit their claims, two weeks after the High Court granted an ap­pli­ca­tion from DBS Bank to wind up the scan­dal-hit com­pany.</p>
    <p>In a no­tice gazetted yes­ter­day, RSM part­ners Lin Yueh Hung and Oon Su Sun said cred­i­tors are re­quired to send in their per­sonal par­tic­u­lars and in­for­ma­tion on their debts and claims by March 27 next year. They will be ex­cluded from the dis­tri­bu­tion of ben­e­fits if they do not do so.</p>
    <p>RSM has been ap­pointed as the liq­uida­tor for the wind­ing-up or­der, which was granted on Dec 11.</p>
    <p>The or­der is re­lated only to Novena Global Health­care and not its other en­ti­ties or sub­sidiaries, RSM told The Straits Times pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Novena Global Health­care, which owes DBS more than $14 mil­lion, was co-founded by Sin­ga­porean cousins Ter­ence Loh and Nel­son Loh. They made the news in Au­gust when they made a £280 mil­lion (S$502 mil­lion) bid to take over English foot­ball club New­cas­tle United, un­der Bel­la­graph Nova Group, which they founded with Chi­nese en­tre­pre­neur Evan­ge­line Shen.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Ac­count­ing and Cor­po­rate Reg­u­la­tory Author­ity con­firmed that eight en­ti­ties owned by the Loh cousins had not filed their an­nual re­turns, and en­force­ment ac­tion is un­der way.</p>
    <p>Novena Global Health­care Group, the par­ent firm of Novena Global Health­care, has been un­der po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion for al­legedly us­ing unau­tho­rised sig­na­tures of ac­count­ing firm Ernst & Young in fi­nan­cial state­ments.</p>
    <p>The group also owes Citibank, UOB, Maybank and Stan­dard Char­tered Bank mil­lions of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, Mr Nel­son Loh trans­ferred all the shares he owned in Novena Global Health­care Group and its re­lated units to Mr Ter­ence Loh for $1. He also re­signed as direc­tor of three en­ti­ties, in­clud­ing the Cay­man Is­lands-reg­is­tered hold­ing com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mr Nel­son Loh has since left Sin­ga­pore.</p>
