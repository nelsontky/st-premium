    <p>RACE 1 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>1 Brand­ing Power has shown abil­ity in both starts. With fur­ther im­prove­ment, he is ca­pa­ble of break­ing through against a rel­a­tively in­ex­pe­ri­enced field.</p>
    <p>4 Lucky Fun closed off nicely on de­but. He is an­other who can fig­ure with fur­ther im­prove­ment and race ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>8 On Ex­cel Star is re­turn­ing firstup with a sound trial. He bears close watch­ing.</p>
    <p>10 Com­fort Life has race ex­pe­ri­ence. He is a win­ner al­ready.</p>
    <p>RACE 2 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>5 Cal­i­for­nia Leg­end is rac­ing with con­fi­dence. He can find the front and play catch-me-if-you-can. If he can over­come the wide gate, he is the one to beat.</p>
    <p>7 Vic­to­ri­ous Leader has re­turned to a com­pet­i­tive mark and gets Zac Pur­ton’s ser­vices for the first time this sea­son. One of his two wins was with the cham­pion jockey in De­cem­ber 2019.</p>
    <p>1 Won­der Ex­press is step­ping down to Class 5, where he is a one­time win­ner. He has the class edge and is aided by cham­pi­onship-lead­ing jockey Joao Mor­eira.</p>
    <p>2 Copart­ner Era mixes his form but can fin­ish in the money.</p>
    <p>RACE 3 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>3 Great Son does his best rac­ing in Class 5. The book­ing of Pur­ton war­rants re­spect. He should get ev­ery op­por­tu­nity from the good gate.</p>
    <p>6 Moon Peaks is look­ing for backto-back wins in the grade. His form is solid.</p>
    <p>5 Trea­sure Chest is also look­ing for back-to-back wins. He is con­sis­tent and should be around the mark again. How­ever, he will need to trans­late his last-start form from the dirt to the turf, which is al­ways a ques­tion mark.</p>
    <p>1 Jade The­atre gets a handy 7lb (4.5kg) claim. He should run well.</p>
    <p>RACE 4 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>8 Win­ning Steed turned his form around last start to grab sec­ond. He ap­pears ca­pa­ble of go­ing one bet­ter. He is on the up.</p>
    <p>9 Coun­try Boy has drawn a good gate and is open to im­prove­ment, es­pe­cially as a lightly raced prospect from the John Size yard. 13 Green Envy is look­ing for backto-back wins. He is step­ping up to Class 4, but has next to no weight on his back.</p>
    <p>3 Speed Fay Fay is con­sis­tent. He de­serves re­spect.</p>
    <p>RACE 5 (1,000M)</p>
    <p>5 Amaz­ing Rocky gets a 7lb claimer up. From the in­side draw, he could prove dif­fi­cult to reel in. 14 No­ble De­sire is win­less, but has gone close in his last two starts. He has a pow­er­ful fin­ish.</p>
    <p>4 United We Stand rarely runs a bad race and should have won more than just one race. He has four top-three ef­forts from five runs this term. It will not shock to see him go on to score again.</p>
    <p>11 Sight Hero is open to im­prove­ment and can fin­ish around the mark.</p>
    <p>RACE 6 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>10 Stun­ning Im­pact can ben­e­fit from a race loaded with early speed. He has abil­ity and a pow­er­ful fin­ish.</p>
    <p>4 Cheer­ful Days is run­ning out of chances, but has shown a stack of abil­ity. He can fig­ure with the right run but the awk­ward gate may prove costly.</p>
    <p>2 De­ci­sive Ac­tion has im­proved back in Class 4. He can be com­pet­i­tive in this grade.</p>
    <p>1 All For St Paul’s can roll for­ward. He will look the win­ner a long way from home.</p>
    <p>RACE 7 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>11 Sight Suc­cess could not have been more im­pres­sive when win­ning on de­but. He looks more than ca­pa­ble of do­ing the same again.</p>
    <p>1 Cir­cuit Six was a Group 3 win­ner in Aus­tralia. He has the class to win, but has drawn an awk­ward bar­rier.</p>
    <p>12 Sky Show slots in with next to no weight on his back. He is right in the mix.</p>
    <p>2 Pri­vate Rocket is ca­pa­ble of bounc­ing back to his best.</p>
    <p>RACE 8 (1,200M)</p>
    <p>2 Har­mony And Rich has per­formed well across seven starts and steps on the dirt for the first time. He tri­alled well on the sur­face re­cently and, with even luck, he is the one to beat.</p>
    <p>1 Sil­ver Fig is a two-time win­ner on the dirt. He has the class edge but does need to con­tend with top­weight du­ties.</p>
    <p>6 Su­per Alliances rel­ishes the sur­face and has drawn well. He is a two-time win­ner from his last three starts and is rac­ing with plenty of con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>3 Gun­nar is com­pet­i­tive in this grade.</p>
    <p>RACE 9 (1,600M)</p>
    <p>2 Kyrus Uni­corn turned his form around last start to fin­ish sec­ond.</p>
    <p>He has drawn well again. With a pos­i­tive ride, he ap­pears ca­pa­ble of go­ing one bet­ter.</p>
    <p>5 Su­per Football is on the up. He should rel­ish the step-up in dis­tance to 1,600m.</p>
    <p>6 Cheva­lier Prince is ca­pa­ble in this spot. He has drawn well and gets Mor­eira for the job.</p>
    <p>12 Casimiro has gone from strength to strength this sea­son, with two wins from his last three starts. He can run an­other bold race, as­sum­ing he han­dles the jump to Class 3.</p>
    <p>RACE 10 (1,400M)</p>
    <p>2 Ex­cel­lent Pro­posal is look­ing for his fourth straight win from just five starts. He was sec­ond on de­but. He is bound for the Four-YearOld Clas­sic Se­ries. He has been noth­ing short of im­pres­sive since ar­riv­ing in Hong Kong. How­ever, with a big weight and a sharp drop from 1,800m to 1,400m, some may want to op­pose him as the likely favourite.</p>
    <p>5 En­rich De­light could not have been more im­pres­sive when win­ning his Hong Kong de­but. With even luck, he is ca­pa­ble of scor­ing back-to-back wins, as he plots a path to­wards the Four-Year-Old Clas­sic Se­ries.</p>
    <p>1 Band Of Brothers is rac­ing well. He has the class edge over sev­eral ri­vals in the race.</p>
    <p>11 Lucky Patch is on the up. He just needs to han­dle the class rise to be com­pet­i­tive. He also looks to be a lead­ing con­tender for the FourYear-Old Clas­sic Se­ries. He is worth keep­ing an eye on.</p>
