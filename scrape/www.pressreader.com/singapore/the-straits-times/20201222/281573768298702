    <p>The trea­surer-gen­eral of Umno, the big­gest party in Malaysia’s rul­ing Perikatan Na­sional al­liance, was sen­tenced to a year in jail af­ter he was con­victed of cor­rup­tion by Malaysia’s High Court yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Tengku Ad­nan Tengku Man­sor, 70, was found guilty un­der Sec­tion 165 of the Pe­nal Code – which crim­i­nalises us­ing pub­lic of­fice to re­ceive grat­i­fi­ca­tion – of ac­cept­ing RM2 mil­lion (S$658,000) from a lo­cal busi­ness­man in 2016, when he was the fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>He was also fined RM2 mil­lion for the of­fence. How­ever, both the im­pris­on­ment and fine have been stayed pend­ing an ap­peal by Tengku Ad­nan to higher courts.</p>
    <p>The con­vic­tion, if up­held by higher courts, would strip Tengku Ad­nan of his fed­eral seat rep­re­sent­ing Pu­tra­jaya. A Mem­ber of Par­lia­ment is dis­qual­i­fied from hold­ing pub­lic of­fice if he or she is jailed for not less than a year or fined RM2,000 and above.</p>
    <p>As long as the con­vic­tion is not over­turned, Tengku Ad­nan will not be el­i­gi­ble to con­test the next na­tional elec­tions. He has been the MP for Pu­tra­jaya since the con­stituency was first formed 16 years ago.</p>
    <p>High Court Judge Mo­hamed Zaini Ma­zlan said yes­ter­day that the pros­e­cu­tion has proved its case “beyond rea­son­able doubt”, while also dis­miss­ing Tengku Ad­nan’s claims of po­lit­i­cal per­se­cu­tion in the case.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion comes just a fort­night af­ter Tengku Ad­nan was dis­charged from an­other cor­rup­tion trial by the High Court over a sep­a­rate charge in­volv­ing the re­ceipt of RM1 mil­lion from an­other busi­ness­man.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Cabi­net min­is­ter is the sec­ond high-pro­file Umno leader to be con­victed of cor­rup­tion in re­cent months, fol­low­ing the con­vic­tion of for­mer prime min­is­ter Na­jib Razak over the 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) scan­dal in July.</p>
    <p>Na­jib was sen­tenced to 12 years in jail and fined RM210 mil­lion, and is now out on bail pend­ing an ap­peal to the Court of Ap­peal.</p>
    <p>Tengku Ad­nan’s con­vic­tion came a day af­ter he hosted a grand drive-in wed­ding re­cep­tion for his son in front of the Fed­eral Court build­ing in the ad­min­is­tra­tive cap­i­tal Pu­tra­jaya. The wed­ding re­cep­tion, at­tended by thou­sands, co­in­cided with Tengku Ad­nan’s 70th birthday.</p>
    <p>Tengku Ad­nan’s l awyers had claimed that the RM2 mil­lion was a po­lit­i­cal do­na­tion given to him as Umno trea­surer, to be used for the party’s by-elec­tion cam­paigns in Se­lan­gor and Perak in 2016.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Jus­tice Mo­hamed Zaini said that he was un­able to ac­cept the ar­gu­ment, es­pe­cially af­ter the de­fence pro­duced a re­ceipt in court for the do­na­tion which was only writ­ten in 2018.</p>
    <p>In his wit­ness state­ment, the for­mer min­is­ter also de­scribed the RM2 mil­lion as “pocket money” to him. In the course of the trial, it was also re­vealed that Tengku Ad­nan’s as­sets stood at RM782.75 mil­lion as at 2016.</p>
    <p>Na­jib pre­vi­ously said that Tengku Ad­nan, who served in his Cabi­net for five years and was also sec­re­tary-gen­eral of the pre­vi­ous rul­ing coali­tion Barisan Na­sional, ac­quired his wealth through his share­hold­ings in var­i­ous com­pa­nies in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>Tengku Ad­nan him­self said that he had been fronting money for Umno for three decades with his own funds, and that the party still owed him to the tune of mil­lions.</p>
    <p>He was granted a dis­charge not amount­ing to ac­quit­tal i n his other RM1 mil­lion graft case ear­lier this month af­ter the pros­e­cu­tion said new de­vel­op­ments had emerged, prompt­ing crit­i­cism from the op­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>He was dis­charged even though the busi­ness­man in that case, Tan Eng Boon, en­tered a guilty plea for brib­ing the min­is­ter, and was fined RM1.5 mil­lion for the of­fence.</p>
