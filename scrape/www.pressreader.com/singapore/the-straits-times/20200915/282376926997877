    <p>The­atre vet­eran Adrian Pang, 54, has been fret­ting over how to en­gage au­di­ences online. It has been a tough time for arts groups in Sin­ga­pore, and Pangde­mo­nium, the the­atre com­pany he started with his wife 10 years ago, is no ex­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>With per­for­mance halls closed, the group – known for its pro­duc­tions of pop­u­lar Broad­way shows – has also strug­gled to get per­mis­sion to play them to au­di­ences at home.</p>
    <p>“The rights-hold­ers, by and large, do not al­low us to even have any archival footage, let alone share it or stream it with any­one,” says Pang.</p>
    <p>While Pangde­mo­nium was al­lowed to stream four old shows, which were pre­sented for a lim­ited time dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, most of its ef­forts hit a brick wall.</p>
    <p>But the an­swer fi­nally came in the form of Wait­ing For The Host, a Zoom-in­spired play that New York­based Marc Palmieri wrote for an online au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>Im­pressed by the script, Pang ap­proached Palmieri’s agent, who gave the green light. The show, about a crew of mis­fits who gather online to re­hearse a Pas­sion Play, will be adapted to a Sin­ga­pore con­text and streamed on Sis­tic Live.</p>
    <p>Wait­ing For The Host, which is be­ing filmed in ac­tors’ homes and directed re­motely by Tra­cie Pang, pre­mieres on Oct 15. Like many re­cent dig­i­tal shows, it is an ex­per­i­ment.</p>
    <p>The idea, Pang ex­plains, is to recre­ate the ex­pe­ri­ence of go­ing to the the­atre. There will be only up to 350 tick­ets a show, each priced at $45, and au­di­ences have to tune in at a spe­cific time. As a result, au­di­ences – even in the age of Zoom fa­tigue – have to be com­mit­ted.</p>
    <p>“Each stream of the play will be at a spe­cific time each night. They will be able to log in, as if go­ing to the the­atre foyer on time, ev­ery night, at 8.30pm. At 9 o’clock sharp, the cur­tain will go up vir­tu­ally and the play will start,” he says.</p>
    <p>While $45 a ticket might seem a bit steep, Pang points out that peo­ple of­ten watch online shows in pairs or in a group.</p>
    <p>He ex­pects the cost of the pro­duc­tion to amount to a six-fig­ure sum and hopes au­di­ences un­der­stand that they need to pay a rea­son­able price for tick­ets.</p>
    <p>“If not, we will con­tinue to bleed. We have had no real in­come for the past six months,” he adds.</p>
    <p>As the global pan­demic rages on, mon­etis­ing online con­tent has loomed large on artists’ minds.</p>
    <p>Most of the arts groups The Straits Times in­ter­viewed said that while putting their works online al­lows them to reach a wider au­di­ence, per­suad­ing them to pay for such con­tent is not easy.</p>
    <p>There are other con­cerns too – the cost of film­ing a per­for­mance pro­fes­sion­ally, the mul­ti­tude of dig­i­tal con­tent avail­able, and that peo­ple online tend to have shorter at­ten­tion spans.</p>
    <p>Last month, the Sin­ga­pore Chi­nese Orches­tra (SCO) pre­sented its first Covid-19-era tick­eted online show on Sis­tic’s live-stream­ing plat­form, Sis­tic Live. The cham­ber con­cert, ti­tled Ren­dezvous, sold 69 tick­ets, each priced at $15. (About 100 tick­ets were given out for free).</p>
    <p>SCO ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Ter­ence Ho says that while the orches­tra will launch more online tick­eted shows, it is think­ing about how to get more au­di­ences on board. This could in­volve of­fer­ing bun­dle pack­ages for con­cert tick­ets, or do­ing more to mar­ket the shows over­seas.</p>
    <p>Home-grown the­atre com­pany Wild Rice has made some of its old shows avail­able on the Wild@ Home plat­form.</p>
    <p>The seven shows have chalked up more than 446,000 views, of which about 35 per cent were from over­seas. The num­bers, how­ever, were lower for the tick­eted shows Merdeka and The Im­por­tance Of Be­ing Earnest. They cost US$10 (S$14) a view and sold 900 and 290 tick­ets re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think these dig­i­tal ini­tia­tives are sus­tain­able,” says Wild Rice’s found­ing artis­tic di­rec­tor Ivan Heng, 56, whose com­pany is ex­pect­ing losses to the tune of $2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“It’s won­der­ful that we are ex­per­i­ment­ing, and it’s opened up the pos­si­bil­i­ties of what the­atre can and might be... That said, this dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of the­atre is a stop­gap mea­sure to keep our com­pa­nies work­ing and keep au­di­ences en­gaged,” he adds.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has pushed groups to ex­per­i­ment with new forms of sto­ry­telling. Wild Rice re­cently teamed up with Pangde­mo­nium and the Sin­ga­pore Reper­tory The­atre to present The Pitch, a funny, sober­ing short film directed by Ken Kwek that shines a spot­light on their strug­gles.</p>
    <p>While peo­ple can watch the film for free online, the three groups are ac­cept­ing do­na­tions via Ray of Hope, with pro­ceeds to be di­vided equally among them.</p>
    <p>Prepa­ra­tions are now afoot for Wild Rice’s an­nual fund-rais­ing gala, the Rice Ball, which is go­ing dig­i­tal this year.</p>
    <p>Heng says it is also work­ing on a re­cov­ery plan for a safe re­turn to the the­atre – rather than cre­at­ing more online con­tent.</p>
    <p>Groups which want to stream their work online have sev­eral op­tions.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s Sis­tic Live, launched in May, has supported about 80 events by 30 arts event or­gan­is­ers so far. About 10 to 20 per cent of Sis­tic Live’s au­di­ences are based over­seas, Sis­tic’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Joe Ow tells The Strait­sTimes.</p>
    <p>In July, tick­et­ing plat­form Peatix launched the beta ver­sion of Peatix Live. Or­gan­is­ers can live-stream events di­rectly via their we­b­cams, or opt for broad­cast­ing soft­wares such as OBS or Stream Labs.</p>
    <p>Then there is The Fu­ture Stage, a 360-de­gree livestream tech­nol­ogy by home-grown the­atre com­pany Sight Lines En­ter­tain­ment and tech start-up Xc­tu­al­ity. It aims to be a one-stop plat­form for tick­et­ing, ad­ver­tise­ment place­ments and mer­chan­dise sales.</p>
    <p>Play­wright Chong Tze Chien, the project’s artis­tic di­rec­tor, says the plat­form launched last month has al­ready re­ceived many book­ings.</p>
    <p>In De­cem­ber, The Fu­ture Stage will present the se­quel to Chong’s vir­tual play Mur­der At Mandai Camp, which ran on Zoom ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>Mur­der At Mandai Camp had a pay-as-you-wish model, with tick­ets start­ing at $15. Peo­ple could pay more if they wanted to – and more than 40 per cent of them did. They sold more than 700 tick­ets for three shows, about a fifth of which were bought by peo­ple liv­ing over­seas.</p>
    <p>Sim Yan Ying, 25, who co-directed Who’s There?, a cross-con­ti­nen­tal work per­formed on Zoom, is keen to see what else the dig­i­tal for­mat has to of­fer.</p>
    <p>The play, which she directed with Alvin Tan, founder of The Nec­es­sary Stage, sold about 820 tick­ets, which were priced at a min­i­mum of $1. Most peo­ple paid at least the sug­gested price of $10 and there were a “sur­pris­ing amount of do­na­tions” after the show, she said.</p>
    <p>Need­less to say, artists are itch­ing to re­turn to the per­for­mance hall.</p>
    <p>Says Heng: “Our art form is about the con­gre­ga­tion. Our the­atre was built to cre­ate the most in­ti­mate, elec­tri­fy­ing and hu­man of ex­pe­ri­ences. You can’t re­ally repli­cate that.”</p>
