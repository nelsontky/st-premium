    <p>Be­fore she founded dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing start-up Quick­Desk in 2014, Ms Charmain Tan, 31, was sell­ing win­ter gloves.</p>
    <p>That busi­ness, which she started when she was 21, was then in the process of wind­ing up, and she was think­ing about what to do with the lessons learnt from be­ing a first-time busi­ness owner.</p>
    <p>Man­ag­ing phys­i­cal in­ven­tory was tough, she said, and so was deal­ing with oc­ca­sions when the com­pany got its es­ti­mates wrong and had to throw stock and ma­te­rial away.</p>
    <p>“There was a lot of wastage. So I thought of mov­ing to some­thing much more ag­ile, such as soft­ware,” added Ms Tan (right).</p>
    <p>“The sec­ond thing was – de­mand for win­ter gloves is sea­sonal. As an en­tre­pre­neur, I was think­ing of my own pain points and, to me, a sales so­lu­tion is al­ways a need.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tan stud­ied sta­tis­tics at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore, but works with col­leagues with ex­per­tise in var­i­ous tech­ni­cal ar­eas such as e-mail au­to­ma­tion and cloud com­mu­ni­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Quick­Desk, which has a team of 11 in­clud­ing Ms Tan, is her first foray into the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The com­pany started out with sell­ing its cus­tomer re­la­tion­ship man­age­ment (CRM) soft­ware plat­form, of­fered on a sub­scrip­tion ba­sis. A CRM plat­form typ­i­cally stores and man­ages cus­tomer in­for­ma­tion, tracks fol­low-up sales com­mu­ni­ca­tion, and au­to­mates repet­i­tive tasks such as in­voice gen­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The com­pany then piv­oted to also gen­er­at­ing dig­i­tal sales leads for clients, which in­volves iden­ti­fy­ing prospec­tive cus­tomers for a prod­uct or ser­vice.</p>
    <p>Quick­Desk be­gan of­fer­ing train­ing pro­grammes as well at the end of 2018, af­ter Ms Tan re­alised that there was sig­nif­i­cant in­ter­est from clients to learn more about dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing.</p>
    <p>The com­pany is look­ing to move next to­wards ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence-en­abled au­to­ma­tion, which could in­volve, for ex­am­ple, de­ter­min­ing when the best time is to mes­sage a con­sumer on Face­book or What­sApp and au­tomat­ing that process.</p>
    <p>“It’s chal­leng­ing be­cause the tech­nol­ogy keeps chang­ing and we have to keep in­no­vat­ing to keep up,” Ms Tan said.</p>
    <p>“But the ben­e­fits from in­vest­ing the time (to do so) are com­pounded, and it’s so fun too be­cause I never stop learn­ing.”</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said that as a fe­male en­tre­pre­neur in the tech space, she has al­ways tried to make the best of the cards she has been dealt.</p>
    <p>“Yes I’m fe­male, but there are also ad­van­tages to that. For one thing, that helps us stand out more,” she said.</p>
    <p>But she ac­knowl­edged that she has strug­gled with self-doubt at times be­cause she does not have prior tech­ni­cal ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan, who has been at­tend­ing cour­ses in prod­uct man­age­ment, said: “I feel help­less some­times when there’s a prob­lem with the (soft­ware) code and I don’t know what to do. But I’ve learnt from ex­pe­ri­ence to em­brace the role and not put my­self down.”</p>
