    <p>The for­mat also un­der­scores the dis­tance be­tween then and now, as if the pol­i­tics and cul­tural tempo of the early aughts were now pe­riod-piece re­vival ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>The episode Harts­field’s Land­ing, from the third sea­son of The West Wing, first aired in Fe­bru­ary 2002.</p>
    <p>Mr Don­ald Trump was still two years from join­ing The West Wing (1999 to 2006) on NBC with The Ap­pren­tice (2004 to 2017) – his main tele­vi­sion gig at the time was co-star­ring with Gri­mace in a com­mer­cial for the McDon­ald’s Big ’N Tasty burger.</p>
    <p>Mr Mark Zucker­berg had yet to start classes at Har­vard. Elec­tions played out at the rel­a­tively staid tempo of network tele­vi­sion news. And an ide­al­is­tic network drama about pol­i­tics could still be a Top 10 show, av­er­ag­ing more than 17 mil­lion view­ers an episode.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, HBO Max pre­miered a stage per­for­mance of Harts­field’s Land­ing.</p>
    <p>Its os­ten­si­ble pur­pose was to ben­e­fit non-profit group When We All Vote. But it could not help seem­ing like the pris­ing open of a time cap­sule.</p>
    <p>It is not alone, how­ever, in try­ing to fit in one last civics les­son be­fore the polls close. It joins sev­eral stage works ar­riv­ing on tele­vi­sion – in­clud­ing hip-hop mu­si­cal Hamil­ton – that are fram­ing the anx­i­eties of this year within the pop cul­ture of the past two decades.</p>
    <p>As tele­vi­sion se­ries go, The West</p>
    <p>Wing was a rel­a­tive no-brainer to adapt for the stage.</p>
    <p>Its cre­ator Aaron Sorkin al­ways sounds as if he were writ­ing for the theatre even when he is not. Recorded un­der coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols at the Or­pheum Theatre in Los An­ge­les, the per­for­mance in­stantly re­calls why the se­ries was such an in­tox­i­cat­ing en­ter­tain­ment and se­duc­tive ideal. The orig­i­nal cast mem­bers are greyer, but their in­ter­ac­tions still sparkle. Ster­ling K. Brown fills in for John Spencer, who died in 2005.</p>
    <p>But the for­mat also un­der­scores the dis­tance be­tween then and now, as if the pol­i­tics and cul­tural tempo of the early aughts were now pe­riod-piece re­vival ma­te­rial.</p>
    <p>Premier­ing in 1999 af­ter a run of rel­a­tive 20th-cen­tury in­sti­tu­tional sta­bil­ity, The West Wing be­lieved that the sys­tem worked, even if the peo­ple in it could al­ways be bet­ter.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Josiah Bart­let (Martin Sheen) was an as­pi­ra­tional Gal­lant to re­al­ity’s Goo­fuses. In the late Bill Clin­ton era, he was a fan­tasy of morally up­stand­ing, un­apolo­getic lib­er­al­ism. In the Bush years, he was a fan­tasy of a proudly in­tel­lec­tual pres­i­dent.</p>
    <p>Today – well, take your pick. Want­ing bet­ter lead­ers never goes out of style, but the se­ries’ rev­er­ent in­sti­tu­tion­al­ism now seems much more re­mote.</p>
    <p>Harts­field’s Land­ing takes its ti­tle from a sub­plot in which aide Josh Ly­man (Bradley Whit­ford) frets over the re­sults from the first small town to vote in the New Hamp­shire pri­mary.</p>
    <p>It is an odd story be­cause Bart­let is run­ning for renom­i­na­tion es­sen­tially un­op­posed. But for a show en­am­oured of retail democ­racy in all its ab­sur­dity, it is too much to re­sist.</p>
    <p>One does won­der, if the episode had been writ­ten this year, whether some­one might at least note the in­or­di­nate power that the quaint tra­di­tion gives a hand­ful of white vot­ers.</p>
    <p>This af­fec­tion for civic rit­ual, in norms-tram­pling Trumpian times, now seems star-crossed and naive.</p>
    <p>As ac­tor Sa­muel L. Jack­son put it dur­ing an act break: “Our pol­i­tics today are a far cry from the ro­man­tic no­tion of The West Wing.” Even the cen­tral metaphor of the episode, Bart­let’s play­ing his ad­vis­ers at chess, seems sadly nos­tal­gic in an era dom­i­nated by play­ers who pre­fer to kick over the board.</p>
    <p>Well, fan­tasy is part of what tele­vi­sion is for. And fan­tasy can be a strong mo­ti­va­tor.</p>
    <p>Ar­guably, part of what fu­els Mr Joe Bi­den’s cam­paign against the Twit­ter pres­i­dent today is the promise, how­ever im­prob­a­ble, of re­turn­ing to a time of rel­a­tive comity, rev­er­ence and quiet. But the show fed a lot of fan­tasies that have smashed hard and ugly against re­al­ity.</p>
    <p>The West Wing was smit­ten with the power of words. But in the real world, there is no speech so mas­terly that it stuns your ri­vals into awed silence, no de­bate ar­gu­ment so ir­refutable that your op­po­nent can’t just bark “Wrong!” over it a hun­dred times.</p>
    <p>It is nice to think that go­ing high al­ways beats go­ing low, but peo­ple know now what The West Wing learnt as it steadily lost au­di­ence to the likes of The Bach­e­lor (2002 to present).</p>
    <p>What works in scripted drama does not nec­es­sar­ily fly in a re­al­i­tytele­vi­sion world.</p>
