    <p>VI­ENNA • Aus­tria has an­nounced that pri­vate in­door gath­er­ings would be limited to 10 peo­ple in the bat­tle to con­tain a sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“From mid­night on Mon­day... all par­ties, pri­vate events and meet­ings in­doors are limited to 10 peo­ple,”</p>
    <p>Chan­cel­lor Se­bas­tian Kurz told a press con­fer­ence on Thurs­day. “We have an ex­po­nen­tial rise in new in­fec­tions in Aus­tria,” he said, adding that the coun­try was go­ing through a sec­ond wave of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Funer­als will be ex­empt from the new rules and the limit for out­doors will re­main at 100, with fur­ther ex­emp­tions for some cul­tural events.</p>
    <p>He ad­mit­ted it would not be legally pos­si­ble to en­force the new limit in peo­ple’s homes but added that he hoped Aus­tri­ans would fol­low the rule. Also from to­mor­row , cafe and restau­rant cus­tomers will have to wear a mask when­ever they’re not at their ta­bles. Pre­vi­ously only wait­ers and other staff had to wear a face cov­er­ing.</p>
    <p>Aus­tria is record­ing sev­eral hun­dred new daily in­fec­tions, with the one-day to­tal at 882 on Sept 11, the sec­ond-high­est of the whole cri­sis.</p>
    <p>Mr Kurz said he was aware the mea­sures “will once again mean sac­ri­fices” from the pop­u­la­tion but they were nec­es­sary “to hope­fully pre­vent a sec­ond lock­down” and the “cat­a­strophic con­se­quences” that would en­tail.</p>
