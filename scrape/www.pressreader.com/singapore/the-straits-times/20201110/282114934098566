    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures were eased at 10 mar­kets this month, said the National En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing this, shop­per ac­cess is no longer con­trolled and in­terim fenc­ing has been re­moved.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures to curb the spread of Covid-19 were in­tro­duced at 39 mar­kets in Sin­ga­pore dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in April.</p>
    <p>They were meant to re­strict the num­ber of pa­trons in each mar­ket.</p>
    <p>As the mar­ket at Block 85 Be­dok North Street 4 was un­der­go­ing re­pair and re­dec­o­ra­tion works, ac­cess con­trol and in­terim fenc­ing were put in place when it re­opened in June.</p>
    <p>Re­stric­tions were lifted this month at mar­kets lo­cated at Block 115 Bukit Merah View and Block 137 Tampines Street 11, as well as the Tiong Bahru Mar­ket, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>While queues were oc­ca­sion­ally seen out­side the mar­kets, es­pe­cially on week­ends, they were deemed to be short and man­age­able, said the agency.</p>
    <p>NEA added that ac­cess con­trol and in­terim fenc­ing had also been re­moved at 10 other mar­kets ear­lier in June, in­clud­ing Beo Cres­cent Mar­ket, Bukit Timah Mar­ket and Tan­glin Halt Mar­ket.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, ac­cess re­stric­tions to four pop­u­lar mar­kets were eased. When vis­it­ing on week­ends, pa­trons are no longer sub­jected to the even/odd day en­try re­quire­ment based on the last digit of their iden­tity card num­ber.</p>
    <p>The four mar­kets are: Gey­lang Serai Mar­ket, Chong Pang Mar­ket at Block 104/105 Yishun Road, the mar­ket at Block 20/21 Mar­sil­ing Lane and the one at Block 505 Jurong West Street 52.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in­terim fenc­ing and ac­cess con­trol will re­main in place at 20 mar­kets, in­clud­ing the four most pop­u­lar ones. Other mar­kets where th­ese re­stric­tions re­main in­clude mar­kets at Block 4A Eunos Cres­cent and Block 341 Ang Mo Kio Av­enue 1.</p>
    <p>“We still ob­serve rel­a­tively long queues when th­ese mar­kets reach their stip­u­lated al­low­able ca­pac­i­ties, and will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion on the ground,” said the agency.</p>
    <p>It added that it will con­tinue to re­view th­ese ar­range­ments, tak­ing into ac­count the crowd size and the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in Sin­ga­pore.</p>

        <p data-role="text">In&#xAD;terim fenc&#xAD;ing at the 79 Red&#xAD;hill Lane Mar&#xAD;ket Cen&#xAD;tre in Au&#xAD;gust. The National En&#xAD;vi&#xAD;ron&#xAD;ment Agency said this is one of 10 mar&#xAD;kets where re&#xAD;stric&#xAD;tions were lifted this month.
