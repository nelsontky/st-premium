    <p>Lib­eral stud­ies, a con­tro­ver­sial sub­ject in Hong Kong sec­ondary schools, can be re­tained but un­der strict pa­ram­e­ters, in­clud­ing vet­ting of the con­tent to be taught, a gov­ern­ment-ap­pointed task force has con­cluded. The sub­ject has been partly blamed for last year’s protests.</p>
    <p>Lib­eral stud­ies, a con­tro­ver­sial sub­ject in Hong Kong sec­ondary schools partly blamed for last year’s protests, can be re­tained but un­der strict pa­ram­e­ters, in­clud­ing do­ing away with cur­rent af­fairs dis­cus­sions and vet­ting the con­tent to be taught, a gov­ern­ment-ap­pointed task force has con­cluded.</p>
    <p>In a fi­nal re­port yes­ter­day, it pro­posed that lib­eral stud­ies be trimmed and for the con­tent to be con­stantly re­viewed to re­duce dis­putes about the sub­ject mat­ter.</p>
    <p>It said stu­dents should not dis­cuss cur­rent af­fairs at all un­less the topic is “ma­ture”.</p>
    <p>“Newly emerg­ing cur­rent is­sues that are still de­vel­op­ing are not suit­able be­cause when events are still de­vel­op­ing, it is dif­fi­cult for teach­ers and stu­dents to con­clude with­out the ben­e­fit of hind­sight or</p>
    <p>ver­ify the ob­jec­tiv­ity and re­li­a­bil­ity of the data and in­for­ma­tion gath­ered, and to en­gage in im­par­tial and ev­i­dence-based dis­cus­sions,” it said.</p>
    <p>The task force put for­ward other pro­pos­als, in­clud­ing hav­ing pub­lish</p>
    <p>ers send text­books sold on the mar­ket for vet­ting and for the gov­ern­ment to con­sider in­clud­ing ma­te­ri­als meant for the sub­ject to be in­cluded in the ex­ist­ing manda­tory text­book re­view sys­tem.</p>
    <p>It also sug­gested that the Ed­u­ca­tion Bureau or­gan­ise a “new series of pro­fes­sional devel­op­ment cour­ses for teach­ers” and con­tinue to con­duct dif­fer­ent forms of ac­tiv­i­ties such as main­land study tours.</p>
    <p>Head of the task force Anissa Chan-Wong said the pro­pos­als re­ceived gen­eral sup­port dur­ing the pub­lic con­sul­ta­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The chair­man of the Hong Kong Fed­er­a­tion of Ed­u­ca­tion Work­ers, Mr Wong Kam Leung, wel­comed them, say­ing the scrap­ping of cur­rent af­fairs dis­cus­sions would pre­vent teach­ers from in­ject­ing per­sonal and po­lit­i­cal views into the course. He added that par­ents would have more con­fi­dence in the sub­ject if text­books were vet­ted.</p>
    <p>“Al­though the vet­ting of text­books is now vol­un­tary for pub­lish­ers, it has al­ready shown to be ef­fec­tive in point­ing out in­ac­cu­rate or bi­ased con­tent,” Mr Wong said.</p>
    <p>But at least one lib­eral stud­ies teacher was scep­ti­cal, say­ing the pro­pos­als would pro­vide a foun­da­tion for the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment to strengthen its sur­veil­lance over teach­ing, teach­ers and stu­dents’ learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“These mea­sures may weaken the pro­fes­sional au­ton­omy of the teach­ers and the flex­i­bil­ity of learn­ing at school. The spe­cific sug­ges­tion of marginal­is­ing the IES (in­de­pen­dent en­quiry study) may even turn the se­nior cur­ricu­lum back­ward – from in­de­pen­dent en­quiry to drilling prac­tices,” said Mr Atung Chan.</p>
    <p>The IES por­tion of lib­eral stud­ies is a graded re­port that older stu­dents have to work on now to an­a­lyse spe­cific cur­rent af­fairs top­ics.</p>
    <p>In­tro­duced 10 years ago by for­mer Hong Kong chief Tung Chee Hwa, lib­eral stud­ies is one of four com­pul­sory sub­jects taught at se­nior sec­ondary school level.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics blame the sub­ject for rad­i­cal­is­ing the young who played a key role in last year’s un­rest on the city’s streets. They say the sub­ject has been used as a tool to spread the ex­treme views of some in the op­po­si­tion even though the in­tent is to equip stu­dents with crit­i­cal think­ing abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>WEAKEN TEACH­ERS’ AU­TON­OMY</p>
