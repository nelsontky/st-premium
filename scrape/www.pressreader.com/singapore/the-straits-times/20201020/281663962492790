    <p>De­lay­ing the in­crease in MediShield Life pre­mi­ums will only re­sult in steeper hikes down the road to catch up with ris­ing claims, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health Koh Poh Koon said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Pre­mi­ums for the com­pul­sory na­tional health in­sur­ance scheme are de­ter­mined by ac­tu­ar­ies and based on both cur­rent claims and fu­ture com­mit­ments, he added. This is why to­tal pre­mi­ums col­lected are higher than cur­rent payouts.</p>
    <p>“We are mind­ful of the im­pact of Covid-19, but we hope Sin­ga­pore­ans can un­der­stand that we need to keep MediShield Life sus­tain­able,” he said in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health (MOH) an­nounced last month that MediShield Life is set to get a re­vamp next year, which would see pre­mi­ums rise by up to a third.</p>
    <p>The in­crease will pay for a wider range of ben­e­fits – such as rais­ing the yearly claim l i mi t from $100,000 to $150,000 – as well as ris­ing health­care costs. It is the first time that MediShield Life pre­mi­ums will go up since the scheme was launched five years ago.</p>
    <p>To cush­ion the im­pact of the pre­mium in­crease, the Gov­ern­ment will roll out a $360 mil­lion Covid-19 sub­sidy for the first two years.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans will get a 70 per cent sub­sidy on the in­crease in the first year. This goes down to 30 per cent in the se­cond year.</p>
    <p>The net pre­mium in­crease af­ter sub­si­dies will be lim­ited to around 10 per cent in the first year, said Dr Koh.</p>
    <p>The i mpend­ing fee hike has sparked a strong re­ac­tion from the pub­lic. Some asked why pre­mi­ums had to go up so soon af­ter the scheme’s launch, while oth­ers ques­tioned the im­pact that the in­crease would have on pri­vate In­te­grated Shield Plans, which build upon what MediShield Life has to of­fer.</p>
    <p>Many who wrote to The Straits Times Fo­rum sec­tion called on the Gov­ern­ment to do more to check ris­ing health­care costs, which they saw as the root of the prob­lem. Sug­ges­tions in­cluded reining in the over-con­sump­tion of med­i­cal ser­vices and re­view­ing med­i­cal mal­prac­tice laws.</p>
    <p>One reader pointed out that pre­mi­ums col­lected un­der the scheme be­tween 2016 and last year were more than dou­ble what was paid out in claims. Oth­ers pro­posed that MOH con­sider re­ward­ing those who stay healthy with a “no­claims” bonus.</p>
    <p>Over the past four years, MediShield Life paid out $3.5 bil­lion for 2.3 mil­lion claims. It col­lected $7.6 bil­lion in pre­mi­ums dur­ing the same time pe­riod.</p>
    <p>In his post yes­ter­day, Dr Koh said to­tal pre­mi­ums are higher than cur­rent payouts be­cause some diseases cur­rently un­der treat­ment will re­quire multi-year care. These in­clude re­nal fail­ure and can­cer.</p>
    <p>“Pol­i­cy­hold­ers also pay more pre­mi­ums dur­ing their work­ing age, which are set aside for fu­ture pre­mium re­bates to mod­er­ate pre­mium i ncreases i n their old age,” he added.</p>
    <p>“This goes some way in mak­ing pre­mi­ums more af­ford­able when we are older.”</p>
    <p>Go­ing into the num­bers, Dr Koh said the av­er­age in­curred loss ra­tio of the MediShield Life fund from 2016 to last year was 104 per cent.</p>
    <p>“This means pre­mi­ums col­lected were slightly less than to­tal monies re­quired for cur­rent claims and fu­ture com­mit­ments,” he said, not­ing that the Gov­ern­ment paid for about 40 per cent of the pre­mi­ums through sub­si­dies for the lower- to mid­dle-in­come and var­i­ous other pre­mium sup­port.</p>
    <p>Over the last four years, an­nual payouts un­der MediShield Life have in­creased by 40 per cent, said Dr Koh.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the number of claimants has gone up by 30 per cent, while the av­er­age pay­out per claimant has gone up by 7 per cent.</p>
    <p>The bulk of the pre­mium in­crease is due to this and to ris­ing health­care costs, he added.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing ques­tions raised over higher pre­mi­ums for older people, Dr Koh said it is ex­pected for pre­mi­ums to rise with age. This is be­cause people are more likely to make claims as they get older.</p>
    <p>Among those aged above 65, roughly one in six re­ceived MediShield Life payouts last year, he said. This is com­pared with about one in 30 for the rest of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>He noted that older people also tend to have more serious con­di­tions that re­sult in larger bills. In this older age group, the av­er­age pay­out per claim was $1,620, com­pared with $1,420 for the rest of the pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>The MediShield Life scheme is not-for-profit, he stressed, adding that pre­mi­ums col­lected are placed in a fund and used solely to ben­e­fit pol­i­cy­hold­ers and ad­min­is­ter the scheme.</p>
    <p>“We will con­tinue to hold to our com­mit­ment that pre­mi­ums will be af­ford­able and no Sin­ga­porean will lose their MediShield Life cov­er­age due to fi­nan­cial dif­fi­cul­ties,” Dr Koh said.</p>
    <p>EAS­ING THE BUR­DEN IN OLD AGE</p>
    <p>Pol­i­cy­hold­ers also pay more pre­mi­ums dur­ing their work­ing age, which are set aside for fu­ture pre­mium re­bates to mod­er­ate pre­mium in­creases in their old age. This goes some way in mak­ing pre­mi­ums more af­ford­able when we are older.</p>
    <p>’’ SE­NIOR MIN­IS­TER OF STATE FOR HEALTH KOH POH KOON, ad­dress­ing the mat­ter some have brought up that to­tal MediShield Life pre­mi­ums col­lected are higher than cur­rent payouts.</p>
