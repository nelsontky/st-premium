    <p>Af­ter sev­eral set­backs, Hong Kong singer Hins Che­ung on Sun­day be­came the first singer to per­form at the Hong Kong Coli­seum with a live au­di­ence dur­ing the on­go­ing coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>It was also the first ma­jor con­cert held at the venue since Tai­wanese crooner Fei Yu-ching’s farewell con­cert last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong singer Ea­son Chan held a char­ity con­cert there in July, but there were no fans present and it was streamed on­line.</p>
    <p>Che­ung, 39, was ini­tially sched­uled to hold his con­cert last Novem­ber, but it was post­poned due to protests in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>He suc­ceeded in ap­pli­ca­tion in March to hold his con­cert this month, but the re­cent spike in Covid-19 cases in Hong Kong caused some un­cer­tainty.</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, the con­cert went ahead on Sun­day af­ter the or­gan­is­ers stepped up preven­tion mea­sures inside and out­side the venue.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of fans al­lowed into the in­door arena, which has a ca­pac­ity of 12,500, was more than halved to 6,000, with phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing man­dated be­tween groups in the sta­dium.</p>
    <p>All fans who at­tended the con­cert were re­quired to wear face masks and they had to use hand sani­tiser and have their tem­per­a­tures checked be­fore en­ter­ing the arena.</p>
    <p>The con­cert kicked off at 8.30pm, with Che­ung first play­ing a staff mem­ber in a video re­mind­ing au­di­ences of Covid-19 mea­sures and safety routes in case of emer­gency.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a per­for­mance by the Hong Kong Chi­nese Orches­tra, Che­ung then ap­peared in per­son to per­form the song Ar­dently Love.</p>
    <p>He thanked fans for at­tend­ing his con­cert. In the past, he said, he would have been un­happy to see the sta­dium only half-full, but in this pan­demic, he was grate­ful to all fans will­ing to come to his con­certs.</p>
    <p>Later in the con­cert, he also per­formed other songs such as Rave, Spring And Au­tumn and What Hurts A Man.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral of his celebrity friends were in at­ten­dance, in­clud­ing Em­peror Group chair­man Al­bert Ye­ung, singers Char­lene Choi and Kenny Kwan, ac­tress Cather­ine Chau and singer-ac­tor Deep Ng.</p>
    <p>Che­ung’s con­cert will be on till next Sun­day.</p>
