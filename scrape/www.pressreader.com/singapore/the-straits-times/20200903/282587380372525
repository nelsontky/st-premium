    <p>South Korean ac­tor Lee Joon-gi plays a mys­te­ri­ous man hid­ing a big se­cret from his wife in the thriller­ro­mance se­ries Flower Of Evil.</p>
    <p>But fans will be happy to know that the 38-year-old ac­tor is noth­ing like his char­ac­ter.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail in­ter­view with The Straits Times, he says: “I’m a re­ally bad liar. If I lie, I’ll get caught im­me­di­ately. So if I’m ever in a sit­u­a­tion like my char­ac­ter Hee-sung, I don’t think I can keep my past hid­den for long.”</p>
    <p>Flower Of Evil is avail­able on iQiyi and Viu, and airs Thurs­days and Fri­days on tvN (StarHub TV Chan­nel 824, Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 518) at 9.45pm.</p>
    <p>Lee stars as Hee-sung, a seem­ingly per­fect fam­ily man mar­ried to a po­lice de­tec­tive.</p>
    <p>But when his wife Ji-won, played by ac­tress Moon Chae-won, starts in­ves­ti­gat­ing an old se­rial killer case, she dis­cov­ers that her hus­band – whose real name is ac­tu­ally Hyun-soo – may have ties to the mur­ders.</p>
    <p>Lee says: “My char­ac­ter re­ally loves his wife, but at the same time, he’s hid­ing so much of him­self from her. It was a chal­lenge to por­tray.</p>
    <p>“I had to be re­ally con­scious of the looks in my eye, my ex­pres­sions and my re­ac­tions to other char­ac­ters.”</p>
    <p>The two ac­tors pre­vi­ously played col­leagues in the 2017 drama Crim­i­nal Minds, an adap­ta­tion of the long-run­ning Amer­i­can se­ries of the same name (2005 to 2020).</p>
    <p>Lee says: “I told Chae-won that we ought to act in a ro­mance drama in the fu­ture when we were work­ing on Crim­i­nal Minds and the op­por­tu­nity to do so came ear­lier than ex­pected.</p>
    <p>“We’re play­ing a mar­ried cou­ple of 14 years and we both find this set­ting to be re­ally fresh. We al­ready know each other’s strengths, hav­ing worked together be­fore.”</p>
    <p>He praises Moon’s act­ing as “con­fi­dent and nu­anced”.</p>
    <p>The 33-year-old ac­tress had good things to say about her on-screen</p>
    <p>hubby too. “He’s so hand­some, as al­ways. He has so many charms, it’s hard to pick one to talk about.”</p>
    <p>She adds: “He’s very sen­si­tive to his scene part­ner’s feel­ings and he’s also re­ally good at liven­ing up the</p>
    <p>at­mos­phere on set.”</p>
    <p>The two play par­ents in the se­ries and both say it was smooth sail­ing work­ing with Jung Seo-yeon, the child ac­tress who plays the cou­ple’s daugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Moon (Bril­liant Legacy, 2009) re­counts over e-mail: “She ran up to me once with a sweet smile and a piece of pa­per, and when I opened it up, it said: ‘Moon Chae-won un­nie (Korean for older sis­ter), Flower Of Evil, fight­ing!’</p>
    <p>“And I’ve con­tin­ued to re­ceive such notes. Watch­ing her write them so seriously with her tiny hands – it’s too adorable.”</p>
    <p>While the se­ries is billed as a mys­tery-ro­mance, Lee – who rose to fame on the big screen with his first lead­ing role in his­tor­i­cal drama The King And The Clown (2005) – says the love story out­weighs the sus­pense. “The mys­tery as­pect is about 20 per cent and the rest is the ro­mance.</p>
    <p>“While what hap­pens between the main cou­ple is re­ally dark, I think the story cul­mi­nates in love.”</p>
    <p>Both leads say that un­der­neath the de­cep­tion, there is a strong love bind­ing the main cou­ple.</p>
    <p>Lee says: “For my char­ac­ter, Ji-won is the first and only per­son to not have any prej­u­dices against him. Her i nno­cence is like a pre­cious gift to him.”</p>
    <p>Moon adds: “Ji-won is some­one who be­lieves in what she can see. She’s not i nflu­enced by oth­ers’ bi­ases and that’s why she can see the warmth and pas­sion in Heesung. She be­lieves he’s a good per­son.”</p>
    <p>Au­di­ences will have to wait a lit­tle longer for new episodes of Flower Of Evil, how­ever, as its pro­duc­tion was re­cently put on hold due to a resur­gence of the coro­n­avirus in South Korea.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to en­ter­tain­ment news por­tal Soompi, the drama’s 11th episode would have aired yes­ter­day i n South Korea, but up­com­ing episodes of the 16-parter will be de­layed un­til fur­ther no­tice.</p>
    <p>Of pre­par­ing for film­ing amid the pan­demic, Lee says: “I can’t prac­tise my ju­jutsu hobby (a form of Ja­panese mar­tial arts) or travel, but this means I have more time to be at home and study the script well.”</p>
    <p>• Flower Of Evil is avail­able on iQiyi and Viu, and airs Thurs­days and Fri­days on tvN (StarHub TV Chan­nel 824, Sing­tel TV Chan­nel 518) at 9.45pm.</p>
