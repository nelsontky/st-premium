    <p>With the spot­light on the newly un­veiled Changi Jurassic Mile, ex­pect queues at Hub & Spoke</p>
    <p>Cafe – which is lo­cated next to Changi Air­port’s Ter­mi­nal 2 – even on week­days.</p>
    <p>Head chef Mo­hamed Fir­dauz, 38, who used to work at The Co­conut Club, has worked with owner</p>
    <p>Jaryl Sim, 30, to come up with two ver­sions of nasi lemak.</p>
    <p>The Nasi Lemak With Chicken ($7.90, above) comes with a large chicken leg mar­i­nated in house­made rem­pah, which is slow-baked and then fried.</p>
    <p>While the skin is crisp and flavour­some, the chicken could have been mar­i­nated longer, as the flavour does not fully pen­e­trate the meat.</p>
    <p>The rice used is a short-grain va­ri­ety from Viet­nam. While it has the flavours of co­conut milk and shal­lots, it is slightly over­cooked with bro­ken grains.</p>
    <p>The house­made chilli paste saves the dish. Sweet, spicy and tangy with as­sam, it is well­bal­anced.</p>
    <p>The Nasi Lemak With Fish & Otah ($6.90) has three fried ikan kun­ing mar­i­nated in turmeric and salt.</p>
    <p>The fish is crispy but could do with more sea­son­ing.</p>
    <p>The Mee Re­bus Java ($6.90) is made us­ing house­made rem­pah and the gravy is thick, aro­matic and flavour­some. But the por­tion of noo­dles is overly gen­er­ous and soaks up the gravy too quickly, so ask for less noo­dles.</p>
    <p>The Eggs Bene­dict ($9.90) comes with two large, per­fectly poached eggs cooked sous-vide, an English muf­fin, two slices of pic­nic ham and a serv­ing of fresh salad leaves with vinai­grette. The Hol­landaise sauce lacks creami­ness and flavour, though.</p>
    <p>The cafe uses good-qual­ity cof­fee pow­der. The Kopi ($1.40) is de­cently strong but not bit­ter. For a sweet twist, go for Gula Me­laka Kopi</p>
    <p>($2.50 with ice).</p>
    <p>The Sig­na­ture Taro Milk ($4.20) is rich with yam that is steamed and mashed in-house.</p>
    <p>WHERE: 01-T2S-02, Changi Air­port Ter­mi­nal 2, 60 Air­port Boule­vard MRT: Changi Air­port</p>
    <p>OPEN: 7.30am to 9.30pm daily</p>
