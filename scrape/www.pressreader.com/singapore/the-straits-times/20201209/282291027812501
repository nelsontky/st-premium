    <p>Mrs Nilushika Silva Jayaweera first came to Sin­ga­pore in 2001 to work as a do­mes­tic helper.</p>
    <p>At the time, she could not have imag­ined cre­at­ing prod­ucts and sell­ing them here.</p>
    <p>Yet the in­trepid Sri Lankan went on to found start-up Nilu Tea. Yes­ter­day, a her­bal bev­er­age it co-cre­ated was launched to com­mem­o­rate 50 years of diplo­matic ties be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p>Said Mrs Jayaweera, 40: “To see a prod­uct I co-cre­ated be­ing sold in Sin­ga­pore dur­ing a time when the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Sri Lanka and Sin­ga­pore is stronger than ever is like a mir­a­cle.”</p>
    <p>The her­bal bev­er­age – named Simha In­fu­sion – was among the first cross-bor­der tie-ups to be launched in com­mem­o­ra­tion of a half cen­tury of bi­lat­eral re­la­tions be­tween the two coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It was cre­ated over 13 months by Nilu Tea and lo­cal food sci­ence and tech start-up As­mara.</p>
    <p>It blends herbs such as ranawara and bael vilva flow­ers from Sri Lanka with in­gre­di­ents com­monly used in Sin­ga­pore such as lemon­grass, liquorice and tulsi basil.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the launch event at the Smart Ur­ban Co-In­no­va­tion Lab in Sci­ence Park 2 that was livestream­ed, Mr Vikram Nair, chair­man of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for De­fence and For­eign Af­fairs, said the two coun­tries are long­stand­ing friends. Their eco­nomic co­op­er­a­tion cul­mi­nated in the sign­ing of a free trade agree­ment in 2018.</p>
    <p>Sri Lankan High Com­mis­sioner to Sin­ga­pore Sashikala Pre­maward­hane noted that one of the coun­try’s big­gest trad­ing part­ners is the Repub­lic, which was its fifth largest in­vestor last year.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Sri Lanka Cus­toms, bi­lat­eral trade last year came up to US$883 mil­lion (S$1.2 bil­lion), with the South Asian na­tion’s ex­ports amount­ing to US$115 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Mr Nair noted that “we’re liv­ing in a world in flux” that is made more chal­leng­ing by Covid-19. But “it has also pro­vided us with the op­por­tu­nity to pull our strengths to­gether and deepen our col­lab­o­ra­tion to face com­mon ad­ver­sity”.</p>
    <p>A vir­tual sign­ing and ex­change of let­ters of in­tent took place dur­ing the launch event be­tween GB Com­mu­nity Devel­op­ment (GBCDL), a con­sor­tium part­ner of the Asian Devel­op­ment Bank’s Global Tech­nol­ogy In­no­va­tion Vil­lage; Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic; and the Univer­sity Busi­ness Link­age Cell of the Univer­sity of Mo­ratuwa to fos­ter start-ups be­tween both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Ms Pre­maward­hane added: “Many in­ter­na­tional start-ups con­sider Sin­ga­pore to be the en­try point to the Asean bloc, with a mar­ket of over 600 mil­lion peo­ple. Fin­tech is one sec­tor that has at­tracted much at­ten­tion of Sri Lankan in­no­va­tors and start-ups.</p>
    <p>“I hope for more col­lab­o­ra­tions with Sin­ga­pore for Sri Lankan start-ups in this sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“The sign­ing of the let­ters of in­tent be­tween GBCDL and renowned Sri Lankan in­sti­tu­tions will no doubt fa­cil­i­tate this process.”</p>
