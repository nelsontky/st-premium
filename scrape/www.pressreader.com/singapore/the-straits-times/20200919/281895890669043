    <p>The Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment is set to in­flu­ence Euro­pean Union poli­cies as the bloc’s ex­ec­u­tive arm pre­pares to un­veil its first anti-racism ac­tion plan.</p>
    <p>Ci­ti­zens face a “re­al­ity of in­grained racism” that can no longer be ig­nored, the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion said i n the draft seen by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­ity vowed to sue na­tions that do not ap­ply the bloc’s strict laws on racism and xeno­pho­bia, and said it would also re­view the ex­ist­ing mea­sures to make sure they are tough enough.</p>
    <p>“Progress to fight racism and hate in Europe is not good enough, but we hope with time and more ef­fort, we can change the tide in Europe,” Ms Vera Jourova, com­mis­sion vi­cepres­i­dent for val­ues and trans­parency, told Bloomberg ahead of yes­ter­day’s planned re­lease of the doc­u­ment.</p>
    <p>“This is the goal of the new ac­tion plan and we will not hes­i­tate to act, in­clud­ing by strength­en­ing our leg­is­la­tion and by vig­or­ously en­forc­ing the rules.”</p>
    <p>The move in Europe comes as the United States is reel­ing from sev­eral highly charged episodes in which po­lice have killed black Amer­i­cans, prompt­ing protests in mul­ti­ple cities. The vic­tims in­clude Mr George Floyd, an un­armed black man who died af­ter a white po­lice of­fi­cer knelt on his neck for nearly nine min­utes. The of­fi­cer has been charged with mur­der.</p>
    <p>“These are times when we have to curb our cyn­i­cism and we should re­ally wel­come this as a very im­por­tant mo­ment in which we have the EU ex­ec­u­tive ac­knowl­edg­ing that racism is a prob­lem in Europe,” said Ms Ju­dith Sun­der­land, act­ing deputy direc­tor for Europe at Hu­man Rights Watch.</p>
    <p>One of the EU’s pri­or­i­ties, ac­cord­ing to the draft, should be to cre­ate a re­li­able set of data to prop­erly as­sess the scale and na­ture of dis­crim­i­na­tion across the bloc.</p>
    <p>Com­pared with data on other grounds of dis­crim­i­na­tion, such as gen­der, dis­abil­ity and age, data on dis­crim­i­na­tion by eth­nic or racial ori­gin is scarce. This is partly due to the back­lash in many na­tions af­ter World War II against the keeping of such records.</p>
    <p>“Ob­sta­cles in­clude prob­lems in es­tab­lish­ing a com­mon method­ol­ogy, with some mem­ber states col­lect­ing such data while oth­ers con­sciously avoid this ap­proach,” the draft says. “As a re­sult, many sur­veys fo­cus on the per­cep­tion of dis­crim­i­na­tion or use prox­ies such as ci­ti­zen­ship or coun­try of birth.”</p>
    <p>The com­mis­sion wants “a new ap­proach on equal­ity data col­lec­tion” and will or­gan­ise a round­table ses­sion to find ways to­wards a more har­monised col­lec­tion of data.</p>
    <p>“Ac­tion plans in gen­eral, while they are never prop­erly and fully im­ple­mented, send a mes­sage that this is an is­sue that we care about” and lay out a road map and spe­cific bench­marks, Ms Sun­der­land said.</p>
