    <p>A six-year-old Sin­ga­porean girl was among three im­ported Covid-19 cases an­nounced yes­ter­day by the Min­istry of Health.</p>
    <p>She ar­rived from In­dia on July 3 and was con­firmed to have Covid-19 on July 30.</p>
    <p>The two other im­ported cases are a 13-year-old boy, a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who ar­rived from In­dia on July 19, as well as a de­pen­dant’s pass holder, a 28-year-old woman who ar­rived from In­dia on July 19.</p>
    <p>All were asymp­to­matic and were tested while on stay-home no­tice at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>There were 396 new coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed as of noon yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 52,205.</p>
    <p>Most were mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, but there were also three com­mu­nity cases – a work pass holder, a work per­mit holder and a short-term visit pass holder.</p>
    <p>One of the three cases was picked up as a re­sult of the min­istry’s proac­tive sur­veil­lance and screen­ing, and an­other had al­ready been placed on quar­an­tine ear­lier. Two of the cases are un­linked.</p>
    <p>No new clus­ters were an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from eight cases two weeks ago to three cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from a daily av­er­age of four cases to one case over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Adi­das and KFC out­lets at Bugis Junc­tion were among places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious, said the Min­istry of Health yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Other places added to the list in­clude Al-Sahira Res­tau­rant at 200 Jalan Sul­tan and the Ng Ah Sio Bak Kut Teh out­let at 208 Ran­goon Road.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and the times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients have vis­ited to get those who were at these places dur­ing the spec­i­fied pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of l oca­tions and times can be found on the min­istry’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>With 183 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 46,476 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 136 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 5,551 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from eight cases two weeks ago to three cases in the past week.</p>
