    <p>To re­duce the red tape for low­in­come house­holds hop­ing to spend less on pub­lic trans­port, the Gov­ern­ment will di­rectly is­sue pub­lic trans­port vouch­ers to about 30,000 house­holds with­out the need for them to ap­ply for the scheme.</p>
    <p>The dead­line for oth­ers who wish to ap­ply for the $50 vouch­ers has also been ex­tended from Oct 31 to Jan 31 next year, giv­ing them more time to do the nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>A record 450,000 $50 vouch­ers are avail­able in to­tal, up from the 300,000 $30 vouch­ers given out pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>This comes as the Pub­lic Trans­port Coun­cil (PTC) rec­om­mended yes­ter­day that bus and train fares will re­main un­changed in the com­ing year de­spite op­er­a­tors SMRT and SBS Tran­sit hav­ing ap­plied for the max­i­mum al­low­able in­crease of 4.4 per cent.</p>
    <p>The coun­cil said it pri­ori­tised the af­ford­abil­ity of train and bus rides for com­muters, al­though it did not re­duce fares, given the broader eco­nomic sup­port al­ready ex­tended to the pub­lic in the four gov­ern­ment Bud­gets and the con­tin­ued con­ces­sion­ary schemes for vul­ner­a­ble groups.</p>
    <p>The Pub­lic Trans­port Voucher scheme is one such re­cur­ring mea­sure, avail­able for house­holds whose monthly in­come per per­son from all sources does not ex­ceed $1,200. The vouch­ers can be used to top up fare cards or buy monthly con­ces­sion passes.</p>
    <p>Those who are el­i­gi­ble for the vouch­ers can ap­ply at com­mu­nity cen­tres or clubs (CCs). Those who need more vouch­ers or who marginally miss the in­come cri­te­rion can also go to the CCs and have their case as­sessed.</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion and the Min­istry of Trans­port, in a joint state­ment yes­ter­day, said the 30,000 low-in­come house­holds that au­to­mat­i­cally qual­ify for the vouch­ers will re­ceive a redemp­tion let­ter in the post and get their vouch­ers as early as De­cem­ber.</p>
    <p>These house­holds are un­der the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment’s ComCare Shortto-Medium-Term As­sis­tance and Long-Term As­sis­tance schemes, and will re­ceive vouch­ers re­gard­less of whether they have pre­vi­ously ap­plied and re­ceived them.</p>
    <p>Mr Melvin Yong, MP and deputy chair­man of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Committee for Trans­port, said of the mea­sures: “This will cer­tainly ben­e­fit our lower-in­come house­holds, many of whom saw their sole bread­win­ner ad­versely af­fected by salary cuts or job losses due to Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>The PTC also rec­om­mended that con­ces­sions for se­nior cit­i­zens, stu­dents and other groups re­main un­changed.</p>
    <p>Up to two mil­lion peo­ple, or one in two Sin­ga­pore­ans, will con­tinue to en­joy con­ces­sion­ary fares un­til at least the next fare re­view.</p>
