    <p>Who­ever wins the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion next week, what is cer­tain is that the re­la­tion­ship be­tween Bei­jing and Wash­ing­ton has ir­re­vo­ca­bly changed and the hawk­ish stance to­wards China is likely to con­tinue, an­a­lysts say.</p>
    <p>Amid a trade war that never quite reached a de­tente and spi­ralling di­plo­matic re­la­tions also lie the co­nun­drums of Hong Kong and Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>For the Chi­nese lead­er­ship, a win for ei­ther Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump or Mr Joe Bi­den will each bring its own set of chal­lenges, but it would end the cur­rent China bash­ing that has dom­i­nated Amer­i­can pol­i­tics, said Mr Wang Huiyao, an ad­viser to China’s Cab­i­net and founder of the Cen­tre for China and Glob­al­i­sa­tion, a Bei­jing think-tank.</p>
    <p>“Trump no longer has an elec­tion to win so this rhetoric against China, that tends to pop up around elec­tion sea­son, will stop,” he said. “That is the time we would fi­nally be able to come to­gether at the ta­ble and talk again.”</p>
    <p>An im­por­tant area would be dis­cus­sions of phases two and three of a com­pre­hen­sive trade deal be­tween the United States and China.</p>
    <p>Yet, th­ese same at­tacks helped so­lid­ify Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping’s po­si­tion within China, draw­ing out a brand of na­tion­al­ism sparked by a na­tion feel­ing it was un­der blight.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s form of Twit­ter diplo­macy also gave rise to “wolf war­rior” diplo­mats in China, a more as­sertive and pub­lic form of con­duct­ing for­eign pol­icy.</p>
    <p>There is also a sense in Bei­jing that Mr Bi­den would bring more to the ta­ble, of­fer­ing co­op­er­a­tion in ar­eas such as cli­mate change and global pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>“There is a world­wide pub­lic health emer­gency and we want to</p>
    <p>co­op­er­ate in ar­eas like vac­cine devel­op­ment, but at the mo­ment, it ap­pears to be more of a com­pe­ti­tion,” Mr Wang said.</p>
    <p>“There’s prob­a­bly go­ing to be more en­gage­ment and di­a­logue (un­der Bi­den) but, of course, the Democrats will push China on is­sues like hu­man rights.”</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has been out­spo­ken about sup­port­ing democ­racy in Hong Kong and has con­tin­ued to en­gage with Tai­wan, which China views as a rene­gade prov­ince to be re­uni­fied by force if nec­es­sary.</p>
    <p>“Bei­jing will likely step up its sabre-rat­tling fol­low­ing the elec­tion, but, in the event of a Bi­den vic­tory, aim to avoid moves that would set back its en­gage­ment with the new ad­min­is­tra­tion,” wrote po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tancy Eura­sia Group in a re­search note.</p>
    <p>No mat­ter who wins, the “struc­ture of con­flict” is likely to re­main for the next decade or two, Mr Wang said. “But de­cou­pling is im­pos­si­ble be­cause we can’t live with­out the other, so China is ready to find a new way to co­ex­ist.”</p>
    <p>Trump no longer has an elec­tion to win so this rhetoric against China, that tends to pop up around elec­tion sea­son, will stop.</p>
