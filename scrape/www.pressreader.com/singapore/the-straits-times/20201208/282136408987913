    <p>The SkillsFutu­re Credit sup­ports in­di­vid­ual-ini­ti­ated train­ing. It is not in­tended to pay for train­ing pro­vided by em­ploy­ers, which should con­tinue to be borne by em­ploy­ers, SSG said.</p>
    <p>The SkillsFutu­re na­tional move­ment, in­tro­duced in 2015, aims to build a cul­ture of skills de­vel­op­ment and life­long learn­ing.</p>
    <p>All Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 25 and above re­ceive an open­ing credit of $500, to en­cour­age in­di­vid­u­als to take own­er­ship of their learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 25 and above as of Dec 31 this year will also re­ceive an ad­di­tional one-off SkillsFutu­re Credit top-up of $500, to fur­ther en­cour­age them to take timely ac­tion to reskill and up­skill. This ex­tra credit, if un­used, will ex­pire on Dec 31, 2025.</p>
    <p>On top of this, Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 40 to 60 (in­clu­sive) as of Dec 31 this year will get an­other $500 in cred­its to im­prove their ac­cess to ca­reer tran­si­tion pro­grammes. This credit will also ex­pire in five years’ time.</p>
    <p>Here are some an­swers to fre­quently asked ques­tions about the scheme.</p>
    <p>Q Can I use my SkillsFutu­re Credit for any course that I want, in­clud­ing those not re­lated to my cur­rent job? A Yes. Open­ing cred­its and the SkillsFutu­re Credit top-up can be used on top of ex­ist­ing gov­ern­ment course sub­si­dies to pay for a range of skills-re­lated cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­clude elected cour­ses that are of­fered by in­sti­tu­tions funded by the Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion (MOE), such as the In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion, poly­tech­nics and au­ton­o­mous univer­si­ties.</p>
    <p>Q If I am un­em­ployed, can I use my SkillsFutu­re Credit to off­set course fees for both the SGUnited Skills and SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways pro­grammes?</p>
    <p>A Yes, trainees may use it off­set the nett course fees once they are en­rolled. Th­ese fees range from $500 for a six-month pro­gramme to $1,000 for a 12-month pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Fees have been kept af­ford­able as the pro­grammes are tar­geted at un­em­ployed in­di­vid­u­als, said SkillsFutu­re Sin­ga­pore (SSG).</p>
    <p>In most cases, gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies for th­ese cour­ses will cover more than 95 per cent of the fees.</p>
    <p>Q What kind of cour­ses are suit­able for se­niors?</p>
    <p>A Se­niors can con­sider us­ing their SkillsFutu­re Credit on SkillsFutu­re cour­ses of­fered by the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion (PA), or cour­ses of­fered by In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity’s Sil­ver In­fo­comm Junc­tions, as well as se­lected cour­ses un­der the Na­tional Sil­ver Academy.</p>
    <p>Se­niors who are keen to pick up ba­sic dig­i­tal lit­er­acy skills can also con­sider us­ing their SkillsFutu­re Credit on the SkillsFutu­re for Dig­i­tal Work­place pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Un­der this pro­gramme, they can learn about emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies and their im­pact on work, as well as learn to in­ter­pret and use data, and adopt a pos­i­tive mind­set for change, in­no­va­tion and re­silience.</p>
    <p>Q Can I use my SkillsFutu­re Credit to co-fund the fees of train­ing cour­ses that my em­ployer will be send­ing me for?</p>
    <p>A No. The SkillsFutu­re Credit sup­ports in­di­vid­ual-ini­ti­ated train­ing.</p>
    <p>It is not in­tended to pay for train­ing pro­vided by em­ploy­ers, which should con­tinue to be borne by em­ploy­ers, SSG said.</p>
    <p>It added that it has been sup­port­ing em­ploy­ers’ train­ing ef­forts through sub­stan­tial sub­si­dies pro­vided for such em­ployer-sup­ported train­ing.</p>
    <p>Q The course I am in­ter­ested in is not SkillsFutu­re Credit-el­i­gi­ble. How can I appeal for the course to be el­i­gi­ble? A The SkillsFutu­re Credit can only be used for skills-re­lated cour­ses “with clear and rel­e­vant train­ing out­comes”, said SSG.</p>
    <p>In­di­vid­u­als may ap­proach the train­ing provider to con­sider sub­mit­ting the course to be ap­proved for use with the SkillsFutu­re Credit and the SkillsFutu­re Credit top-up, sub­ject to the el­i­gi­bil­ity cri­te­ria.</p>
