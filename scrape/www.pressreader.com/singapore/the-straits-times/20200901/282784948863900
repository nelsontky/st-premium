    <p>ROME • What if you threw a film fes­ti­val and no­body came?</p>
    <p>That, in essence, is the chal­lenge fac­ing or­gan­is­ers of this year’s Venice Film Fes­ti­val, the glam­orous an­nual com­pe­ti­tion where stars, crit­ics, pho­tog­ra­phers and in­dus­try ex­ec­u­tives min­gle on the bustling Lido, over­look­ing sandy beaches and the blue Adri­atic.</p>
    <p>Pro­vided, of course, it is a nor­mal year.</p>
    <p>But in 2020, the world’s old­est film fes­ti­val is forced to walk a tightrope be­tween pre­serv­ing its lustre as the premier launch pad for Academy Award-win­ning films, while safely nav­i­gat­ing the coro­n­avirus cri­sis and avert­ing the con­tro­versy over gen­der inequal­ity that has dogged it in the past.</p>
    <p>Open­ing to­mor­row and con­tin­u­ing un­til Sept 12, the pres­ti­gious event, now in its 77th year, will be the first in­ter­na­tional film fes­ti­val since the pan­demic shut­tered com­pe­ti­tions around the world.</p>
    <p>It has put in place a host of safety mea­sures – from lim­ited seat­ing to ther­mal scan­ners to a fan-free red car­pet – to pro­tect at­ten­dees as Covid-19 cases con­tinue to climb in Italy and around the world.</p>
    <p>In July, fes­ti­val di­rec­tor Al­berto Bar­bera de­clared the event “saved” as he an­nounced the 18 films among the ap­prox­i­mately 60 pre­sented that would vie for the top award, the Golden Lion. He promised that the fes­ti­val would pre­serve the “live­li­ness of con­tem­po­rary cin­ema”.</p>
    <p>De­spite its scaled-down size with the­atre ca­pac­ity re­duced by about half, La Bi­en­nale di Venezia takes on greater im­por­tance this year due to the can­cel­la­tion of ri­val film fes­ti­vals across the globe, among them the glitzy Cannes Film Fes­ti­val on the Cote d’Azur in France.</p>
    <p>But just days ahead of the open­ing, or­gan­is­ers are scram­bling to nav­i­gate un­prece­dented ter­ri­tory amid un­cer­tain at­ten­dance and last-minute can­cel­la­tions.</p>
    <p>Whereas ac­tors Brad Pitt, Meryl Streep and Scar­lett Jo­hans­son pro­vided the star fire­power at last year’s fes­ti­val, on­go­ing travel re­stric­tions – es­pe­cially a travel ban from the United States into Europe – mean that most Hol­ly­wood elites will be no-shows, along with ac­tors and di­rec­tors from China, In­dia and South Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>Those ar­riv­ing from out­side Europe’s Schen­gen zone will have to sub­mit re­sults of a Covid-19 test just be­fore their de­par­ture, with a sec­ond test car­ried out in Venice, mean­ing that some at­ten­dees may have to can­cel.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this week, the fes­ti­val an­nounced that Amer­i­can ac­tor Matt Dil­lon would be a last-minute sub­sti­tute on the jury for Ro­ma­nian di­rec­tor Cristi Puiu.</p>
    <p>No rea­son was given for Puiu’s ab­sence, but in­dus­try trade mag­a­zines noted he had given a speech ear­lier last month in which he said it was “in­hu­mane” to watch movies with a mask on.</p>
    <p>Those con­firmed as at­tend­ing in­clude, among oth­ers, Bri­tish ac­tress Tilda Swin­ton, Span­ish di­rec­tor Pe­dro Almod­ovar, US di­rec­tor Oliver Stone and Dan­ish ac­tor Mads Mikkelsen.</p>
    <p>The un­cer­tain line-up of stars and dearth of top names leaves Aus­tralian ac­tress Cate Blanchett, pres­i­dent of the jury, to take up the man­tle of celebrity – and so­cial ac­tivism – at Venice.</p>
    <p>She was the leader of the #Me­Too women’s march up the red car­pet steps at Cannes two years ago that sought to bring at­ten­tion to the lack of par­ity and di­ver­sity in cin­ema.</p>
    <p>The pres­ence of Blanchett helps raise such aware­ness while the fes­ti­val seeks to stanch crit­i­cism lev­elled in re­cent years over the glar­ing lack of women di­rec­tors in fes­ti­vals’ top line-ups.</p>
    <p>The Os­car-win­ning head­liner told Va­ri­ety magazine last Thurs­day that this year’s eight women di­rec­tors in the main com­pe­ti­tion in Venice is “a di­rect re­sponse to the pos­i­tive ad­vances that have been made this year”.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers say it is too early to tell whether a page has turned.</p>
    <p>“It’s all about be­ing con­sis­tent and dili­gent and be­liev­ing that women make movies as well as men, and us­ing that in the way you pro­gramme,” said Melissa Sil­ver­stein, founder and publisher of Women And Hol­ly­wood, which ad­vo­cates for gen­der di­ver­sity and in­clu­sion in film.</p>
    <p>Last year’s fes­ti­val opened un­der con­tro­versy af­ter the in­clu­sion in the line-up of French-Pol­ish di­rec­tor Roman Polan­ski, who fled the US af­ter his 1977 con­vic­tion for rape of a 13-year-old girl.</p>
    <p>There were also only two fe­male di­rec­tors in the se­lec­tion. In both 2018 and 2017, only one fe­male di­rec­tor was rep­re­sented.</p>
    <p>Blanchett said more was rid­ing on the jury’s de­ci­sions this year, given the lim­ited op­por­tu­ni­ties for film­mak­ers to show their work pub­licly, due to the coro­n­avirus clo­sures.</p>
    <p>“So, what­ever the de­lib­er­a­tions the jury will make will be more im­pact­ful. I don’t take that re­spon­si­bil­ity or priv­i­lege lightly.”</p>
