    <p>While the Gov­ern­ment has done well to get cit­i­zens’ feed­back on of­fi­cial poli­cies, the way it reaches out will have to change to bet­ter serve them, says the new chair­man of gov­ern­ment feed­back unit Reach, Mr Tan Kiat How.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan, who is Min­is­ter of State in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice, said Reach will con­tinue to be a bridge be­tween pol­i­cy­mak­ers and the Sin­ga­pore­ans whom pol­i­cy­mak­ers are try­ing to serve.</p>
    <p>“But we prob­a­bly have to rein­vent the modal­ity, while the mis­sion re­mains the same,” said Mr Tan, who took over as Reach chair­man from Mr Sam Tan last month.</p>
    <p>He ex­plained: “The way we do it, the way we en­gage, (and) the way we or­gan­ise our­selves to reach out to dif­fer­ent groups of peo­ple will have to change.”</p>
    <p>The new head – one of the PAP’s batch of 24 new MPs – out­lined his vi­sion for Reach to The Sunday Times on Thurs­day dur­ing an in­ter­view at the Min­istry of Na­tional De­vel­op­ment (MND), where he is a Min­is­ter of State.</p>
    <p>He noted that while Reach’s ob­jec­tives to im­prove peo­ple’s lives through en­gag­ing them is as rel­e­vant as it was 35 years ago when it started, much has changed since.</p>
    <p>The world has seen shifts in the global econ­omy, tech­nol­ogy, geopol­i­tics and the en­vi­ron­ment, said Mr Tan, adding that dif­fer­ent groups of peo­ple, such as the young, now ap­proach giv­ing feed­back in dif­fer­ent ways.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has re­sponded to this well, said Mr Tan, point­ing out that al­most every min­istry or of­fi­cial agency has a com­mu­nity en­gage­ment func­tion, and many of them have gone on­line through plat­forms like Face­book to do so.</p>
    <p>But more can be done by the Gov­ern­ment to rein­vent the way it gath­ers feed­back and cre­ates policy, he said, and he is think­ing about how this can be done bet­ter.</p>
    <p>“Rein­vent­ing our­selves means that we will look at some of the poli­cies, relook as­sump­tions, think of new ways of do­ing things,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Cre­at­ing new op­por­tu­ni­ties, and our style of pol­i­cy­mak­ing, our style of de­vel­op­ing strate­gies and plan­ning pro­grammes, will have to be much more nim­ble.”</p>
    <p>A chal­lenge that he and his team at Reach iden­ti­fied is to find the best way to reach out to as di­verse a group of Sin­ga­pore­ans as pos­si­ble, with­out al­low­ing “echo cham­ber” ef­fects on so­cial me­dia to dom­i­nate con­ver­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially im­por­tant for sen­si­tive is­sues tied strongly to an in­di­vid­ual’s iden­tity like race, re­li­gion or fam­ily sta­tus. Mr Tan said while such con­ver­sa­tions might not be easy to have, the Gov­ern­ment should not shy away from them.</p>
    <p>But the im­me­di­ate pri­or­ity for Reach will be to find out from Sin­ga­pore­ans how they are cop­ing with the Covid-19 pan­demic, which has hit the econ­omy badly, and cost some Sin­ga­pore­ans their jobs, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan added that Reach will also ad­just its work plans and iden­tify what ar­eas to fo­cus on after Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob de­liv­ers her ad­dress to­mor­row to open the 14th term of Par­lia­ment, which will set out the agenda and plans of the Gov­ern­ment for its five-year term.</p>
    <p>Last Thurs­day, Mr Tan also out­lined the ar­eas on which he will be fo­cus­ing in his MND port­fo­lio.</p>
    <p>He said that he has been tasked by Min­is­ter for Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Des­mond Lee to look at “ABC” – A for an­i­mal-re­lated is­sues, B for the built en­vi­ron­ment sec­tor’s trans­for­ma­tion mat­ters, and C for the con­struc­tion in­dus­try and how to get it back on its feet.</p>
    <p>When asked how his pre­vi­ous role as the former chief ex­ec­u­tive of the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Author­ity com­pares with his port­fo­lios in Gov­ern­ment now, he said that the sub­ject mat­ter might be dif­fer­ent, but ul­ti­mately he is guided by the same aim to im­prove peo­ple’s lives.</p>
    <p>“It’s still the way of think­ing about pub­lic policy, think­ing about trade-offs, think­ing about how to ac­tu­ally im­ple­ment those poli­cies,” he said.</p>
