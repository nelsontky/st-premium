    <p>For months since the start of the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod in April, firms in the con­struc­tion, marine ship­yard and process sec­tors have had to halt all work.</p>
    <p>With rev­enues ceas­ing while they con­tin­ued to pay salaries and other over­head costs, many firms had to dig into their re­serves.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, they wel­comed the ex­ten­sion of the for­eign worker levy waiver and re­bates, say­ing this would help to re­duce some of the fi­nan­cial pres­sure on them.</p>
    <p>But they added that what will ul­ti­mately keep firms afloat is to be able to restart projects so they can keep up with on­go­ing costs.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Con­trac­tors As­so­ci­a­tion Lim­ited (SCAL) pres­i­dent Ng Yek Meng said the ex­tra support will ben­e­fit es­pe­cially small and medium-sized sub­con­trac­tors that em­ploy the bulk of the for­eign work­ers in the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Some of them hire up to 500 for­eign work­ers, and the levy, along with ac­com­mo­da­tion costs, means that these com­pa­nies have to fork out $1,000 per worker per month on av­er­age, ex­clud­ing salaries, he said in an in­ter­view con­ducted over video con­fer­enc­ing.</p>
    <p>He es­ti­mates that these firms stand to save about 50 per cent of their sunk costs with the re­liefs.</p>
    <p>“With­out the gov­ern­ment support pack­ages such as the Jobs Support Scheme and levy waiver and re­bate, many com­pa­nies may not have gone this far,” said the SCAL, which rep­re­sents over 3,000 firms in the con­struc­tion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“The var­i­ous gov­ern­ment support schemes helped many com­pa­nies re­duce their losses and keep them afloat. The support schemes helped to re­duce large lay­offs and ben­e­fited more than 100,000 in the lo­cal work­force in the con­struc­tion in­dus­try.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore Marine In­dus­tries pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Si­mon Kuik said cash flow is a ma­jor con­cern for many com­pa­nies in his in­dus­try, since pay­ment is tied to com­ple­tion mile­stones and com­pa­nies have high over­heads.</p>
    <p>He said the ex­tended support will tide com­pa­nies over this dif­fi­cult pe­riod while the sec­tor gets its work­force back to work.</p>
    <p>Team­build Engi­neer­ing and Con­struc­tion ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Johnny Lim said re­sum­ing full op­er­a­tions as soon as pos­si­ble is im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>“If you can only work with 30 to 50 per cent of your work­ers, progress be­comes im­peded and pro­duc­tiv­ity is not quite there,” he said, though ac­knowl­edg­ing this was something that could not be rushed.</p>
    <p>Mr Kuik said com­pa­nies may go un­der if another wave of out­breaks leads to a sec­ond round of work be­ing stopped.</p>
    <p>He said: “The as­so­ci­a­tion ap­pre­ci­ates the op­por­tu­nity to closely work with gov­ern­ment agen­cies on the shut­ting down and SafeRes­tart for the sec­tor, so we can quickly be ready to op­er­ate in full force un­der the new nor­malcy.”</p>
    <p>HOW SCHEMES HAVE HELPED</p>
    <p>With­out the gov­ern­ment support pack­ages such as the Jobs Support Scheme and levy waiver and re­bate, many com­pa­nies may not have gone this far... The support schemes helped to re­duce large lay­offs and ben­e­fited more than 100,000 in the lo­cal work­force in the con­struc­tion in­dus­try.</p>
