    <p>Thai­land’s much an­tic­i­pated Cab­i­net reshuf­fle be­gan in a messy fash­ion yes­ter­day, with the gov­ern­ment’s eco­nomic team quit­ting while Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-o-cha was away on a pro­vin­cial trip.</p>
    <p>Those who re­signed were Fi­nance Min­is­ter Ut­tama Sa­vanayana; En­ergy Min­is­ter Son­ti­rat Son­ti­ji­ra­wong; Higher Ed­u­ca­tion, Sci­ence, Re­search and In­no­va­tion Min­is­ter Su­vit Maesincee; and Deputy Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral to the Prime Min­is­ter for Po­lit­i­cal Af­fairs Kob­sak Pootrakool.</p>
    <p>They left with about as lit­tle fan­fare as when they first joined the Cab­i­net con­trolled by the pre­vi­ous mil­i­tary gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>In part­ing re­marks to the press, Dr Ut­tama con­firmed re­ports that the group’s men­tor, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter and eco­nomic czar Somkid Ja­tus­rip­i­tak, had also re­signed.</p>
    <p>Their de­par­ture leaves a big void. If pro­jec­tions here come true, Thai­land’s econ­omy is ex­pected to con­tract by 8.1 per cent for the year and lose some 10 mil­lion jobs.</p>
    <p>While this is an op­por­tu­nity for Mr Prayut to revamp his ad­min­is­tra­tion, a mis­step could lead to disas­ter, say an­a­lysts.</p>
    <p>On one level, the res­ig­na­tions could not have come at a worse time. Bangkok is grap­pling with a cri­sis of con­fi­dence, af­ter lapses in Covid-19 con­trol mea­sures last week trig­gered panic about re­newed com­mu­nity trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Un­til last week, the king­dom was look­ing for­ward to re­build­ing its bat­tered tourism in­dus­try af­ter staving off lo­cal trans­mis­sions for over a month. Bangkok had kept its state of emer­gency in place un­til July 31, say­ing it would bet­ter con­trol move­ment in and out of the king­dom.</p>
    <p>But an Egyp­tian mil­i­tary of­fi­cer, who was not quar­an­tined on ar­rival, and even vis­ited a shop­ping mall in Ray­ong prov­ince, was found to be in­fected af­ter he had left the coun­try last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The day ear­lier, on Fri­day, the nine-year-old daugh­ter of a diplo­mat was found to be in­fected when she ar­rived from Su­dan with her fam­ily and trav­elled to a Bangkok con­do­minium.</p>
    <p>Ho­tels in Ray­ong, a coastal prov­ince lined with beach re­sorts, saw mass can­cel­la­tions of book­ings as the gov­ern­ment scram­bled to tighten quar­an­tine loop­holes.</p>
    <p>Irate Thais flooded Twit­ter with vul­gar­ity-laden hash­tags. Some were vis­i­bly hos­tile when Mr Prayut per­son­ally vis­ited Ray­ong on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>A shake-up in the Cab­i­net would al­low Mr Prayut to show that he is do­ing some­thing about the cri­sis, said Mr Stithorn Thananithi­chot, a po­lit­i­cal sci­en­tist at King</p>
    <p>Pra­jad­hipok In­sti­tute. He told The Straits Times: “If he doesn’t drop Somkid, how can he say he is re­spond­ing to the new nor­mal?”</p>
    <p>But he added that the Pre­mier would need to act fast to re­store con­fi­dence. “The peo­ple need to know what ex­actly the gov­ern­ment wants to do to deal with the cri­sis, and who will take care of it, rather than whether now is the time for a reshuf­fle,” he said.</p>
    <p>The big question now is whether the new team will have fresh ideas. Dr Somkid was the driv­ing force be­hind the Eastern Eco­nomic Cor­ri­dor, the next-gen­er­a­tion in­vest­ment hub now laid low by the pan­demic. The other four min­is­ters were es­sen­tially tech­nocrats who sat un­easily in the rul­ing Palang Pracharath Party, which was cob­bled to­gether from sea­soned politi­cians of var­i­ous ilk.</p>
    <p>While there is re­port­edly fierce jock­ey­ing within Palang</p>
    <p>Pracharath for va­cated seats, pun­dits ex­pect Mr Prayut to give the most im­por­tant posts to out­siders with eco­nomic or busi­ness cre­den­tials. There is lit­tle fat avail­able for pork bar­rel pol­i­tics, be­cause the tu­mul­tuous global econ­omy will pun­ish fis­cal mis­takes heav­ily.</p>
    <p>The new team will need to un­der­stand and com­mu­ni­cate the dif­fi­cult trade-offs that need to be made be­tween con­trol­ling Covid-19 trans­mis­sion and keep­ing the econ­omy afloat, said Dr Viroj Na Ranong, a re­search di­rec­tor at the Thai­land De­vel­op­ment Re­search In­sti­tute. “If we em­brace this po­si­tion that we need to be Covid-free and don’t open up to for­eign tourists, we will suf­fer a very bad eco­nomic re­ces­sion this and next year,” he said.</p>
