    <p>Ms Alyssa Marie Loo Li Ann had Pres­i­dent Halimah Yacob all to her­self yesterday when the 19-year-old was the only one to be awarded the Pres­i­dent’s Schol­ar­ship at a vir­tual cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>Start­ing this year, only schol­ar­ship re­cip­i­ents who are pur­su­ing their stud­ies in the cur­rent year will be an­nounced by the Pub­lic Ser­vice Com­mis­sion (PSC).</p>
    <p>When asked how many oth­ers were of­fered the schol­ar­ship this year, the PSC de­clined to pro­vide num­bers but said: “There are oth­ers... in­clud­ing those who are cur­rently do­ing their na­tional ser­vice.”</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent’s Scholarshi­ps have been awarded since 1966. Four to six have been awarded each year for the past 10 years.</p>
    <p>Ms Loo at­tended the vir­tual cer­e­mony from home with her mother Agnes Phuah, who works as an ad­min­is­tra­tive of­fi­cer. Her fa­ther is a hu­man re­source direc­tor, while her younger sis­ter is in Se­condary 3 this year.</p>
    <p>Also in at­ten­dance at the ses­sion were Min­is­ter for Trade and In­dus­try and Min­is­ter-in-charge of the Pub­lic Ser­vice Chan Chun Sing and PSC chair­man Lee Tzu Yang.</p>
    <p>Ms Loo, who is headed to Brown Univer­sity in the United States in Jan­uary to read lin­guis­tics, is in­ter­ested in ex­plor­ing top­ics such as hav­ing Singlish as a cul­tural icon, and the ef­fects of a bilin­gual pol­icy. Said the for­mer Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion stu­dent: “Sin­ga­pore has a very com­plex lin­guis­tic land­scape that de­serves more at­ten­tion and re­search”.</p>
    <p>Ad­dress­ing Ms Loo in a speech at the vir­tual cer­e­mony, Pres­i­dent Halimah said: “The start of your jour­ney in pub­lic ser­vice comes at a crit­i­cal point in mod­ern his­tory. The Covid-19 cri­sis has dis­rupted the global econ­omy and ev­ery as­pect of our lives.”</p>
    <p>In­tegrity, ser­vice and ex­cel­lence form the foun­da­tion of trust that Sin­ga­pore­ans have in the Gov­ern­ment’s abil­ity to ex­e­cute poli­cies, plans and ini­tia­tives, she said, and “strength­en­ing this foun­da­tion is es­pe­cially crit­i­cal as it is no longer busi­ness as usual”.</p>
    <p>“We have a pop­u­la­tion that is more dis­cern­ing, with strong views on what is in their best in­ter­ests and wants to be more en­gaged in de­ci­sions af­fect­ing them.</p>
    <p>“They also have a strong sense of fair­ness and equal­ity and want these values re­flected more clearly in what­ever we do. In the years to come, there will be new paths to forge and dif­fi­cult de­ci­sions to make. This is a chal­lenge for this gen­er­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore­ans – a trial of our for­ti­tude and a test of our re­silience.”</p>
    <p>With Covid-19 hav­ing changed the eco­nomic en­vi­ron­ment around Sin­ga­pore, some time­tested ideas and strate­gies will have to be re-ex­am­ined, and the coun­try will need “civil ser­vants who can not only think crit­i­cally but who also have un­ortho­dox ideas or unique so­lu­tions in a sit­u­a­tion where the path to growth is not so clear”, she said.</p>
    <p>Urg­ing Ms Loo to broaden her hori­zons, ex­pand her net­works and de­velop fresh per­spec­tives, Madam Halimah said: “I en­cour­age you to step out of your com­fort zone, open your­self to new ex­pe­ri­ences and seize ev­ery op­por­tu­nity to de­velop the skills and ex­per­tise Sin­ga­pore will need for the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Ms Loo said that be­ing the only re­cip­i­ent at this year’s Pres­i­dent’s Schol­ar­ship cer­e­mony is “a big hon­our... I feel very lucky to have the chance to speak to Pres­i­dent Halimah per­son­ally”.</p>
    <p>CRIT­I­CAL JUNC­TURE</p>
    <p>The start of your jour­ney in pub­lic ser­vice comes at a crit­i­cal point in mod­ern his­tory. The Covid-19 cri­sis has dis­rupted the global econ­omy and ev­ery as­pect of our lives.’’</p>
