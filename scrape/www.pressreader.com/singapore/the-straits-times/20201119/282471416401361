    <p>Emma Cor­rin and Josh O’Con­nor play Princess Diana and Prince Charles in the new­est sea­son of the award-win­ning biopic of the Bri­tish roy­als, The Crown, which recre­ates an in­fa­mously tur­bu­lent pe­riod of their re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>But even after do­ing ex­ten­sive re­search on the cou­ple, the ac­tors came to the con­clu­sion that it is im­pos­si­ble to know what was truly go­ing on in that mar­riage – and maybe that is how it ought to be.</p>
    <p>The stars, who are both English, jumped on a video call to chat with the press about Sea­son 4 of the ac­claimed drama, which has won 10 Em­mys since de­but­ing on Net­flix four years ago, in­clud­ing Out­stand­ing Lead Ac­tress in a Drama for Claire Foy, who played a younger ver­sion of Queen El­iz­a­beth II.</p>
    <p>This sea­son picks up the story in the 1970s with the first decade of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana’s re­la­tion­ship, from their courtship and mar­riage to her grow­ing celebrity sta­tus to their even­tual drift­ing apart.</p>
    <p>Also prom­i­nent this sea­son are the ten­sions be­tween the queen, played by Olivia Col­man, and prime min­is­ter Mar­garet Thatcher (Gil­lian An­der­son).</p>
    <p>Cor­rin, 24, and O’Con­nor, 30, are asked if they feel the royal cou­ple and the break­down of their mar­riage – which was ruth­lessly dis­sected by the Bri­tish tabloids – were mis­un­der­stood.</p>
    <p>Cor­rin says: “Ob­vi­ously, ev­ery­thing that ev­ery­one knows about them comes through the me­dia, and the me­dia’s por­trayal is very mis­lead­ing at times and very bi­ased. So I think that maybe we don’t ever, and will never, have an au­then­tic un­der­stand­ing of what they were ac­tu­ally like.”</p>
    <p>“But I also don’t think that’s a bad thing – I think we shouldn’t know. It’s none of any­one’s busi­ness,” says the ac­tress, who ap­peared in the Bat­man spin-off se­ries Pen­ny­worth (2019). “The se­ries just tries to go be­hind the doors of it in a fic­tional way.”</p>
    <p>O’Con­nor agrees. “It didn’t take long for either of us, when we were re­search­ing these parts, to re­alise that it’s lit­er­ally im­pos­si­ble to find the truth on this mar­riage – just as it is with any mar­riage in the world.</p>
    <p>“There will al­ways be one per­son who thinks this and the other per­son who thinks that. And each will have 100 friends who will think the other per­son is guilty,” says the ac­tor, who starred in the ro­man­tic drama God’s Own Coun­try (2017).</p>
    <p>At the same time, the enigma of the re­la­tion­ship af­fords the cre­ators and cast of The Crown some room for lit­er­ary li­cence.</p>
    <p>“It’s in­cred­i­bly lib­er­at­ing for Emma and I be­cause it means we can cre­ate what we want and make the de­ci­sions we want to make.”</p>
    <p>The co-stars did, how­ever, feel a sense of re­spon­si­bil­ity in tak­ing on these roles, given how in­vested in the royal fam­ily many Bri­tons feel, how beloved Princess Diana was and the fact that Prince Charles is still alive.</p>
    <p>“There was a lot of pres­sure,” ad­mits Cor­rin. “And cer­tainly when I was do­ing my re­search, I be­came over­whelmed by the amount of in­for­ma­tion out there and how much of it was quite mis­lead­ing.</p>
    <p>“What re­ally helped in tak­ing away that pres­sure, though, was just get­ting on set and start­ing to do it. Un­der­stand­ing the story we were telling also helped and we had amaz­ing move­ment and di­alect coaches that made it feel much more ac­ces­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>O’Con­nor dealt with the pres­sure by fo­cus­ing on the fic­tional el­e­ments of the nar­ra­tive.</p>
    <p>“It’s about mak­ing a dis­tinc­tion be­tween the char­ac­ter and the real per­son,” he says. “There are as­pects of Charles and Diana we wanted to be spe­cific about so that peo­ple feel safe in the knowl­edge that we are play­ing those real peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“But the in­ter­est­ing bit as an ac­tor is all the stuff you cre­ate around that, and I think as soon as you start see­ing it as a fic­tion­alised ver­sion of these peo­ple, the pres­sure kind of lifts.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause it’s about in­ter­pre­ta­tion rather than repli­ca­tion.”</p>
