    <p>NEW DEHLI If it were not for a cricket ac­ci­dent that al­most killed him, Mr Uday Ko­tak prob­a­bly would not be the world’s rich­est banker.</p>
    <p>A ball that hit him in the head and led to emer­gency surgery pushed Mr Ko­tak, then 20, to aban­don his dream of be­com­ing a pro­fes­sional player. Af­ter a brief stint at the fam­ily’s cot­ton-trad­ing busi­ness, he went on to pur­sue his Master of Busi­ness Ad­min­is­tra­tion at Mum­bai’s pres­ti­gious Jam­nalal Ba­jaj In­sti­tute of Man­age­ment Stud­ies, be­fore start­ing out in fi­nance in 1985 at the age of 26.</p>
    <p>Mr Ko­tak, now 61, has a for­tune es­ti­mated at around US$16 bil­lion (S$21 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to the Bloomberg Billionair­es In­dex.</p>
    <p>While In­dia has been grap­pling with a shadow-lend­ing cri­sis, his Ko­tak Mahin­dra Bank (KMB) has been able to rise through the crowd, gain­ing in­vestors’ trust by start­ing to slow lend­ing to riskier sec­tors more than two years ago and keep­ing good cor­po­rate gov­er­nance.</p>
    <p>When the pan­demic added to the industry’s woes by erod­ing bor­row­ers’ abil­ity to re­pay, the firm was one of the first to raise cap­i­tal to for­tify its bal­ance sheet, help­ing to boost in­vestors’ con­fi­dence that it will be among the big­gest win­ners as the na­tion emerges from its Covid-19-in­duced re­ces­sion.</p>
    <p>The strat­egy paid off: As lenders have plunged glob­ally, KMB shares are up 17 per cent this year, and Mr Ko­tak just gained an ex­ten­sion to his chief ex­ec­u­tive term for an­other three years.</p>
    <p>“As far as I am con­cerned, be­com­ing the world’s rich­est banker is only a proxy for Uday be­ing one of the world’s smartest bankers,” said Mahin­dra Group chair­man Anand Mahin­dra, whose tie-up with Mr Ko­tak back in 1986 led to the firm’s name. “More im­por­tantly, he has un­der­stood that what makes a bank sus­tain­able and durable is not just smart strate­gies but unas­sail­able gov­er­nance.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ko­tak’s firm stands out in a na­tion where lenders have some of the worst bad-loan ra­tios in the world.</p>
    <p>Trou­ble started brew­ing for the firms in 2015 when In­dia’s reg­u­la­tor ini­ti­ated a mas­sive au­dit that un­earthed hid­den sour­ing loans.</p>
    <p>That led to a shadow-bank­ing cri­sis that con­strained the broader econ­omy and fur­ther hurt as­setqual­ity scores and prof­its.</p>
    <p>KMB, though, was able to adapt. It re­duced lend­ing to small and medium-sized com­pa­nies and un­se­cured in­di­vid­u­als. Its shares have ral­lied more than 24 per cent in each of the past three years.</p>
    <p>While its bad-loan ra­tio has risen this year, it ranked as the sec­ond low­est among peers, with its cap­i­tal-ad­e­quacy score be­ing the high­est. The na­tion’s sec­ond-largest lender by mar­ket value re­ported an un­ex­pected 27 per cent profit surge in the quar­ter ended Sept 30.</p>
    <p>The firm got an­other boost last month, when the cen­tral bank pro­posed in­creas­ing the own­er­ship limit for founders, ef­fec­tively re­duc­ing the risk that Mr Ko­tak will be forced to di­lute his 26 per cent stake in the lender as pre­vi­ously de­manded by the Re­serve Bank of In­dia (RBI).</p>
    <p>Mr Ko­tak set up an in­vest­ment com­pany in 1985 with a 3 mil­lion ru­pee loan from fam­ily and friends and part­nered with Mr Mahin­dra the fol­low­ing year.</p>
    <p>The firm, which started off dis­count­ing bills, later ex­panded its loan port­fo­lio and got into stock bro­ker­ing, in­vest­ment bank­ing, in­sur­ance and mu­tual funds.</p>
    <p>It con­verted into a lender in 2003 af­ter get­ting RBI’s nod.</p>
    <p>The fi­nancier has been KMB’s CEO since its be­gin­ning and gained more con­trol of it in 2006 by end­ing a part­ner­ship of more than a decade with Gold­man Sachs Group.</p>
    <p>He rose through the ranks by keep­ing strong un­der­writ­ing prac­tices and avoid­ing lend­ing to riskier sec­tors, fo­cus­ing in­stead on ex­pand­ing col­lat­eral-backed loans for farm equip­ment, mort­gages and ve­hi­cles, ac­cord­ing to HDFC Se­cu­ri­ties re­searcher Deepak Jasani.</p>
    <p>While RBI just ap­proved the ex­ten­sion of Mr Ko­tak’s CEO term, in­vestors are start­ing to won­der what will hap­pen af­ter he hands over the reins. Un­like the heads of many fam­ily-owned en­ter­prises in In­dia, Mr Ko­tak has avoided en­rolling fam­ily mem­bers into the lender’s board or in top ex­ec­u­tive po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>That helped main­tain in­vestors’ and de­pos­i­tors’ con­fi­dence in a coun­try where the lack of cor­po­rate gov­er­nance and trans­parency has al­ready brought down three banks and pushed two shadow lenders to bank­ruptcy in fewer than two years.</p>
    <p>“It has been all Uday,” said Mr Ananth Narayan, a for­mer banker and now an as­so­ciate pro­fes­sor of fi­nance at Mum­bai’s S.P. Jain In­sti­tute of Man­age­ment & Re­search.</p>
    <p>“There are a lot of good peo­ple un­der him but, frankly, they are all over­shad­owed by Uday. Any­body who has to step into Uday’s shoes has a tough job.”</p>
    <p>For now, Mr Ko­tak is still very much at the helm.</p>
    <p>The firm is ex­plor­ing a takeover of smaller ri­val In­dusInd Bank, peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the mat­ter said in Oc­to­ber, a move that would ce­ment KMB’s po­si­tion as one of In­dia’s lead­ing pri­vate lenders and boost its as­sets by more than 80 per cent.</p>
    <p>Look­ing back, Mr Mahin­dra says his de­ci­sion in the 1980s to bet on Mr Ko­tak has been re­ward­ing.</p>
    <p>“I vividly re­call both my fa­ther and un­cle ask­ing me at that time why I had so much faith in this young man fresh out of busi­ness school,” he said. “I told them that I had a hunch that one day we would be very pleased to have our name as­so­ci­ated with his.”</p>
    <p>As far as I am con­cerned, be­com­ing the world’s rich­est banker is only a proxy for Uday be­ing one of the world’s smartest bankers. ’’</p>
