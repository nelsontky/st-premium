    <p>As a prospec­tive Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion con­tem­plates its de­fence pol­icy, what ma­jor chal­lenges lie ahead in the Indo-Pa­cific? Some are po­lit­i­cal, oth­ers more struc­tural.</p>
    <p>Most ob­vi­ous on the po­lit­i­cal side is a need to re­pair US bi­lat­eral al­liances dam­aged by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s toxic mix of hy­per-trans­ac­tion­al­ism and ne­glect. Trust in the United States has suf­fered gen­er­ally among its al­lies and a larger group of part­ner coun­tries in the Indo-Pa­cific.</p>
    <p>But it could be worse. Some, like Aus­tralia, have weath­ered the past four years with­out sig­nif­i­cant harm to the de­fence and se­cu­rity re­la­tion­ship. Ja­pan has also averted se­ri­ous cri­sis, ow­ing to for­mer prime min­is­ter Shinzo Abe’s wily mit­i­ga­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>South Korea has suf­fered most among US Pa­cific al­lies, un­der­cut by Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s di­rect deal­ings with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, while si­mul­ta­ne­ously hit with ex­or­bi­tant hikes to host-na­tion fi­nan­cial sup­port and threats to with­draw US troops from the penin­sula. The US al­liance with the Philip­pines has frayed for rea­sons that have lit­tle to do with Mr Trump, and are more struc­tural and do­mes­tic in na­ture.</p>
    <p>In an era of fis­cal over-ex­ten­sion in the US, a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion will still want Ja­pan to spend more and ac­quire new mil­i­tary ca­pa­bil­i­ties that boost de­ter­rence, though Mr Abe’s suc­ces­sor, Mr Yoshi­hide Suga, may prove less forth­com­ing on de­fence than he was. The US-South Korea al­liance will need a first prin­ci­ples re­think, not just al­liance man­age­ment, in order to sat­isfy both the South Korean de­sire for more au­ton­omy in de­fence and greater flex­i­bil­ity that en­ables US forces in South Korea to con­trib­ute to re­gional se­cu­rity beyond the penin­sula. In­dia, al­ready the most im­por­tant US re­gional part­ner out­side of its al­liances, is likely to cleave closer to Wash­ing­ton, as it grows ever warier of China.</p>
    <p>UN­PALAT­ABLE CON­TI­NU­ITY CHALLENGE</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den can be ex­pected to show much greater affin­ity for and ap­pre­ci­a­tion of al­lies than Mr Trump. Get­ting them to work more closely to­gether, as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion is be­lat­edly dis­cov­er­ing, will be im­por­tant.</p>
    <p>How­ever, al­liances and part­ner­ships are no more than strate­gic means – ends are what count ul­ti­mately. More­over, Indo-Pa­cific coun­tries are not all set on dis­con­ti­nu­ity from Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>The view one of­ten hears pri­vately in the re­gion is that the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has got more right than wrong on China. There is a tacit recog­ni­tion that strate­gic com­pe­ti­tion be­tween the US and China is struc­tural, and here to stay. There is no nos­tal­gia for the Obama era and zero de­sire for pol­icy som­er­saults be­tween US ad­min­is­tra­tions of dif­fer­ent ide­o­log­i­cal stripes. Amer­ica’s re­gional al­lies and part­ners want con­sis­tency, not apolo­gies.</p>
    <p>Team Bi­den may find it un­palat­able, but they will need to frame ba­sic el­e­ments of pol­icy con­ti­nu­ity from Mr Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion, es­pe­cially re­gard­ing China. Mr Bi­den is un­likely to re­verse course on tech­no­log­i­cal bi­fur­ca­tion from China, for ex­am­ple, but could ditch the di­vi­sive “de­cou­pling” fram­ing in favour of “re­silience” that is in­clu­sive of al­lies.</p>
    <p>The fact that the US has lost its tech­no­log­i­cal lead in some sec­tors means that lever­ag­ing its al­lies’ and part­ners’ de­fence re­search and de­vel­op­ment ef­forts will be vi­tal for Wash­ing­ton to main­tain a mil­i­tary edge vis-a-vis China. That will re­quire a dif­fer­ent sort of de­fence-in­dus­trial model and higher-level in­te­gra­tion with al­lies. Here, a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would need to com­mit po­lit­i­cal cap­i­tal in Congress in order to ef­fect nec­es­sary changes to the le­gal frame­work.</p>
    <p>MIS­MATCH BE­TWEEN COM­MIT­MENTS AND RE­SOURCES</p>
    <p>The wickedest chal­lenges con­fronting who­ever in­hab­its the White House next year are struc­tural in na­ture, stem­ming from the shift­ing bal­ance of power.</p>
    <p>China, North Korea and Rus­sia (to a lesser ex­tent) have de­signed and pos­tured their strate­gic ca­pa­bil­i­ties so as to un­der­cut US mil­i­tary pre-emi­nence and cred­i­bil­ity as a re­gional se­cu­rity guar­an­tor.</p>
    <p>The most ba­sic challenge in tailoring US de­fence strat­egy to a re­gion as vast as the Indo-Pa­cific is the mis­match be­tween com­mit­ments and re­sources.</p>
    <p>Suc­ces­sive US de­fence sec­re­taries, ad­dress­ing the In­ter­na­tional In­sti­tute for Strate­gic Stud­ies Shangri-La Di­a­logue, have de­scribed the Indo-Pa­cific Com­mand as their “pri­or­ity theatre”. But the flow of re­sources tells a dif­fer­ent story, both di­rectly and in terms of ca­pac­ity-build­ing as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>The Indo-Pa­cific has been the des­ig­nated pri­or­ity for a decade, but lit­tle has hap­pened beyond tin­ker­ing at the edges of the US re­gional force pos­ture. China’s mil­i­tary moderni­sa­tion is out­pac­ing Amer­ica’s abil­ity to re­spond on the scale re­quired.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing is not Wash­ing­ton’s only po­ten­tial ad­ver­sary in the re­gion or glob­ally, but grap­pling with China’s challenge alone could ab­sorb US strate­gic at­ten­tion for the fore­see­able fu­ture. A con­ven­tional US force pos­ture in the Indo-Pa­cific that pre­serves a mil­i­tary bal­ance ca­pa­ble of de­ter­ring Bei­jing is still achiev­able. But this will re­quire po­lit­i­cal will and dis­ci­pline from the Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to make the nec­es­sary re­source trade-offs, es­pe­cially in Europe and the Mid­dle East. Team Bi­den’s start­ing point must be to recog­nise that an over­stretched, heav­ily in­debted US no longer has the re­sources to act as a su­per­power in all re­gions.</p>
    <p>IN­VEST­ING IN DE­TER­RENCE</p>
    <p>Tai­wan will re­main the most im­por­tant strate­gic is­sue in US-China re­la­tions and a key flash­point for the next ad­min­is­tra­tion. As­sum­ing that the Bi­den camp in­tends to de­fend Tai­wan from a forcible takeover by China, main­tain­ing the forces nec­es­sary to de­ter and, if nec­es­sary, to de­feat the Peo­ple’s Lib­er­a­tion Army (PLA) in a “lim­ited” war presents a daunt­ing re­source challenge. The US needs to grap­ple with the grow­ing vul­ner­a­bil­ity of its for­ward forces in the western Pa­cific to China’s counter-in­ter­ven­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties, es­pe­cially its land-launched mis­siles.</p>
    <p>Fu­ture war-fight­ing ca­pa­bil­i­ties are likely to look dif­fer­ent from those tra­di­tion­ally as­so­ci­ated with re­as­sur­ance. The US mil­i­tary, long an an­chor of the coun­try’s re­gional re­la­tion­ships, may find it­self pulling in dif­fer­ent di­rec­tions as it seeks to square the cir­cle be­tween re­as­sur­ing al­lies and de­ter­ring China. Al­lies are likely to ex­pe­ri­ence en­trap­ment and aban­don­ment fears si­mul­ta­ne­ously, beyond Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>If a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion stays out of the Intermedia­te-Range Nu­clear Forces Treaty, will it look to de­ploy new mis­siles into the western Pa­cific? If so, which al­lies will ac­cept them? If not, is Wash­ing­ton will­ing to share tech­nol­ogy en­abling them to field their own mis­siles, boost­ing col­lec­tive de­ter­rence?</p>
    <p>ARMS-CON­TROL CHAL­LENGES</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, the shadow of nu­clear weapons looms larger over the re­gion. North Korea’s ad­vances to­wards a nu­clear-tipped in­ter-con­ti­nen­tal bal­lis­tic mis­sile are part of the struc­tural prob­lem.</p>
    <p>But the US ap­proach to­wards Py­ongyang should be pri­mar­ily po­lit­i­cal. An early test of a new ad­min­is­tra­tion by Py­ongyang is in­evitable and Mr Bi­den would need to avoid a re­peat of the dis­tract­ing cri­sis from 2017. The price could be of­fer­ing an arms di­a­logue up­front to North Korea, grant­ing it de facto sta­tus as a nu­clear-weapons state in re­turn for a nu­clear and mis­sile test­ing freeze.</p>
    <p>Beyond North Korea, would a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion at­tempt to draw China into some mul­ti­lat­er­alised form of arms con­trol? China’s nu­clear arse­nal re­mains nu­mer­i­cally mod­est. But as noted in the Pen­tagon’s most re­cent as­sess­ment of China’s mil­i­tary power, the PLA is ad­just­ing its nu­clear pos­ture to in­clude launch on warn­ing and blur­ring the line be­tween con­ven­tional and nu­clear pay­loads within its mis­sile in­ven­tory. This po­ten­tially low­ers the thresh­old of nu­clear es­ca­la­tion in a Tai­wan sce­nario.</p>
