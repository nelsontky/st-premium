    <p>NEW YORK • Ser­ena Wil­liams will face a de­pleted field at the US Open which starts to­mor­row, but her re­cent form has made clear that her lat­est quest for a record-ty­ing 24th Grand Slam sin­gles ti­tle will hardly be a cake­walk.</p>
    <p>Since ten­nis re­turned from a Covid-19 hia­tus that lasted nearly five months, the former world No. 1 has gone 3-2 in matches that lasted three sets and have taken a toll on her weary legs.</p>
    <p>“It’s hard to play the way I have been play­ing and to stay pos­i­tive,” she said.</p>
    <p>“And to play nine hours in a week is too much. I don’t usu­ally play like that. It’s all new for me.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter fall­ing to world No. 116</p>
    <p>Shelby Rogers in the Top Seed Open quar­ter-fi­nals, Wil­liams went on to the Western and South­ern Open where she lost in the third round to 13th-seeded Maria Sakkari.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can squan­dered an op­por­tu­nity to close out her Greek op­po­nent on serve in the se­cond set and started get­ting cramps as her op­po­nent launched a come­back.</p>
    <p>With so many of the world’s top play­ers opt­ing not to travel to New York amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, the path to a Grand Slam ti­tle might never again ap­pear so un­trou­bled for Wil­liams.</p>
    <p>The 38-year-old will be seeded third at the US Open. She has been drawn into the same quar­ter as former cham­pion Sloane Stephens, 2017 fi­nal­ist Madi­son Keys, twotime Grand Slam win­ner Gar­bine Mugu­ruza and Sakkari.</p>
    <p>“If she doesn’t win this one, I would think peo­ple, and more specif­i­cally, she her­self would most prob­a­bly doubt that she can win an­other one,” said seven-time Grand Slam cham­pion Mats Wi­lan­der.</p>
    <p>“If she doesn’t win this one, it’s go­ing to be harder to win the next one and the one af­ter that.”</p>
    <p>With six of the world’s top 10 – in­clud­ing the top-ranked Ash­leigh Barty, Si­mona Halep (se­cond) and holder Bianca An­dreescu (sixth) – pulling out of the hard-court event for var­i­ous rea­sons, one of Wil­liams’ ri­vals will be Aus­tralian Open cham­pion and fel­low Amer­i­can Sofia Kenin.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the 21-year-old’s prepa­ra­tions for Flush­ing Mead­ows has been equally out of sync, ex­it­ing the open­ing round of the Western and South­ern Open in a straight-set de­feat by French­woman Al­ize Cor­net.</p>
    <p>Kenin will be the only reign­ing</p>
    <p>Grand Slam cham­pion i n t he women’s draw this year, but she ad­mit­ted win­ning in Mel­bourne had no bear­ing on her chances of tri­umph­ing in New York.</p>
    <p>“It is ob­vi­ously there and no one can ever take that away, but I feel like I have to some­how set that aside,” the world No. 4 said.</p>
    <p>“Hope­fully I’ll play a bit bet­ter (this week), and hope­fully I’ll have enough match play... we’ll see how it goes.”</p>
    <p>At No. 3, Karolina Pliskova is the top seed and the Czech, who is also chas­ing a maiden Slam, will fancy her chances, hav­ing come clos­est when fin­ish­ing run­ner-up in New York in 2016.</p>
    <p>The US Open has pro­duced a dif­fer­ent cham­pion in each of the previous five years and, given the lack of big names and match prac­tice, there could very well be a new name again come Sept 13.</p>
