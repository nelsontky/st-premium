    <p>Pedes­tri­ans will not be po­liced based on how they walk un­der the new pedes­trian code of con­duct.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Par­lia­men­tary Sec­re­tary for Trans­port Baey Yam Keng told The Straits Times last Fri­day that the code was meant to raise aware­ness and build a gra­cious cul­ture.</p>
    <p>“The pur­pose of the code of con­duct for pedes­tri­ans is not de­ter­rence; we do not in­tend to po­lice how peo­ple walk,” he said. “The High­way Code, sim­i­larly, sets out cer­tain norms to guide pedes­tri­ans on safe be­hav­iour, such as how to cross roads safely.”</p>
    <p>He was com­ment­ing on the is­sue af­ter the in­tro­duc­tion of the code drew con­tro­versy.</p>
    <p>Mr Baey said fo­cus group ses­sions held by the Ac­tive Mo­bil­ity Ad­vi­sory Panel (AMAP) in the last two years had found that it was com­mon to spot pedes­tri­ans and de­vice users “glued to their phones and un­aware of their sur­round­ings”.</p>
    <p>He said he has also ob­served in­con­sid­er­ate de­vice users who choose to ride on foot­paths, even when cy­cling paths are avail­able, or fail to dis­mount from their bike or slow down when they en­ter a crowded space. “Such be­hav­iour puts ev­ery­one else at risk on paths,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Trans­port Min­istry, af­ter tak­ing into ac­count AMAP’s rec­om­men­da­tions, de­cided to ex­pand the code of con­duct for path users to also in­clude pedes­tri­ans. Mr Baey noted that the code of­fers safety tips, and is meant to be sim­ple and in­tu­itive.</p>
    <p>“For ex­am­ple, the guide­line en­cour­ag­ing pedes­tri­ans to keep left on foot­paths mir­rors com­mon prac­tice to­day where users keep left on es­ca­la­tors,” he said. “The ba­sic prin­ci­ple is that ev­ery­one should play their part and look out for one an­other to stay safe in these com­mon spa­ces.”</p>
    <p>He said that most peo­ple “al­ready have good com­mon sense” and take ref­er­ence from of­fi­cial guide­lines.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to sug­ges­tions that sep­a­rate paths could be built for cy­clists and pedes­tri­ans, Mr Baey said that there is “just not enough space in Sin­ga­pore to build dis­tinct paths for dif­fer­ent users”.</p>
    <p>He added: “Nev­er­the­less, with the right foun­da­tion for a gra­cious ac­tive mo­bil­ity cul­ture, we can make more spa­ces in our neigh­bour­hoods and city a safer and friend­lier place to walk, cy­cle and ride in to­gether.”</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to sug­ges­tions that sep­a­rate paths could be built for cy­clists and pedes­tri­ans, Mr Baey said that there is “just not enough space in Sin­ga­pore to build dis­tinct paths for dif­fer­ent users”.</p>
    <p>You tell cy­clists, mo­torists to look out for pedes­tri­ans, but fail to ad­vise the pedes­tri­ans to re­spect other road users. Many walk­ers do not even check if there’s a car com­ing. Or that the green man is flash­ing. Safety is a duty for all. Re­spect who­ever uses the roads or path­way. GW Xyey PG</p>
    <p>I am from the Pioneer Gen­er­a­tion and I walk a lot. I do not use an ear­piece or my mo­bile phone when walk­ing.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery day, I find my­self try­ing to avoid ag­gres­sive cy­clists. Re­gret­tably, this code em­bold­ens the ag­gres­sive cy­clists even more. Christo­pher Chan</p>
    <p>We all have to do our part to stay safe. Kyle Gue­varra</p>
    <p>I think we need a more con­certed pas­toral and civics ed­u­ca­tion pro­gramme, where ci­ti­zens are taught self-aware­ness and self-re­flec­tion from a young age. How to put them­selves in an­other per­son’s shoes. How to put oth­ers be­fore self.</p>
    <p>If we get these ba­sics right from an early age, then we won’t need polic­ing from the state.</p>
    <p>The code of con­duct is a good step to ad­dress the symp­toms of anti-so­cial be­hav­iour. But it’s not the cure. Shoop Oei</p>
    <p>The root of the prob­lem is the path­way. Broaden the path­ways; some are ridicu­lously nar­row. Bit­ing Cyn­thia</p>
    <p>Al­most ev­ery day, we need to look out for “traf­fic” on the pave­ment. Yap Pear­lyn</p>
    <p>Please spare a thought for those who need to cy­cle for work pur­poses... don’t risk their lives by forc­ing them onto the road. We all need to live on this small is­land more grace­fully, and be con­sid­er­ate to both pedes­tri­ans and cy­clists. Wong Danny Do you think a bolder code of con­duct on pedes­trian paths is needed?</p>
    <p>My whole life, I have had lit­tle or no prob­lem with cy­clists. They ring the bell from far away, I move to one side.</p>
    <p>Some peo­ple have a prob­lem with giv­ing way to cy­clists.</p>
    <p>These peo­ple are usu­ally seg­ments of the pop­u­la­tion that be­lieve side­walks are not meant to be shared by cy­clists, skaters and run­ners. Ba­si­cally lane hog­gers without cars. Mohamed Fir­daus</p>
