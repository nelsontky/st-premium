    <p>JUSTICE IN SIN­GA­PORE</p>
    <p>The high-pro­file case of for­mer do­mes­tic worker Parti Liyani looks set to dom­i­nate the de­bate when Par­lia­ment sits next Mon­day, as MPs have filed 14 ques­tions on the is­sue.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat will also de­liver a min­is­te­rial state­ment on the Gov­ern­ment’s ef­forts to com­bat the coro­n­avirus, ac­cord­ing to the agenda set in the Or­der Pa­per is­sued by the Clerk of Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ques­tions on the crim­i­nal case of Ms Parti, who was ac­quit­ted on ap­peal, came from both sides of the House.</p>
    <p>They in­clude what went wrong in the in­ves­ti­ga­tions; if the Gov­ern­ment would con­sider al­low­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers to be ac­com­pa­nied by non-le­gal per­son­nel for po­lice in­ter­views; and if the Gov­ern­ment could pro­vide di­rect le­gal aid to vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als who are charged with crim­i­nal of­fences.</p>
    <p>Ms Parti, 46, had been ac­cused by the fam­ily of prom­i­nent business chief Liew Mun Leong of steal­ing items worth a to­tal of $34,000.</p>
    <p>The case sparked an up­roar af­ter a High Court judge found, on ap­peal, that Ms Parti’s con­vic­tion by the trial judge was “un­safe” for var­i­ous rea­sons. These in­cluded the way the po­lice han­dled the ev­i­dence and the mo­tive be­hind the ac­cu­sa­tions made by some mem­bers of the Liew fam­ily. It led to ques­tions be­ing raised about the crim­i­nal justice sys­tem’s treat­ment of peo­ple who are less well-off.</p>
    <p>In­ter­nal re­views are also be­ing con­ducted by the At­tor­ney-Gen­eral’s Cham­bers (AGC) and the po­lice, while Law and Home Af­fairs Min­is­ter K. Shan­mugam has said he will make a min­is­te­rial state­ment in Par­lia­ment next month.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Murali Pil­lai (Bukit Ba­tok) has asked what steps will be taken by the dif­fer­ent agen­cies to iden­tify why the is­sues raised in the case oc­curred, and how these is­sues will be ad­dressed in fu­ture.</p>
    <p>“We must take all nec­es­sary steps to main­tain a high stan­dard of pro­bity and com­pe­tence in the ad­min­is­tra­tion of justice in Sin­ga­pore that en­joys the con­fi­dence of fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans,” Mr Murali, who is the chair­man of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee (GPC) for Home Af­fairs and Law, told The</p>
    <p>Straits Times yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Non-Con­stituency MP Leong Mun Wai wants to know if a com­mit­tee of in­quiry with peo­ple not af­fil­i­ated to the Gov­ern­ment could be ap­pointed to look into the con­duct of the po­lice and pros­e­cu­tors.</p>
    <p>As for the Covid-19 pan­demic, Ms Jes­sica Tan (East Coast GRC) asked when Covid-19 mea­sures can be fur­ther eased, con­sid­er­ing the low num­ber of com­mu­nity cases, and what can be ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party MP Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC) asked, among other things, about the Gov­ern­ment’s re­view of work-from-home ar­range­ments.</p>
    <p>Some MPs have asked about the next-gen­er­a­tion Elec­tronic Road Pric­ing (ERP) sys­tem that will be in­tro­duced next year.</p>
    <p>The chair­man of the GPC for Trans­port, Mr Sak­tiandi Su­paat (Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC), asked what steps the au­thor­i­ties will take to avoid long queues for the in­stal­la­tion of the new ERP de­vice and whether motorists will have to pay to re­place it should it be spoilt.</p>
    <p>Five Bills will be de­bated and four new Bills will be tabled, in­clud­ing the Per­sonal Data Pro­tec­tion (Amend­ment) Bill, which in­volves pri­vate or­gan­i­sa­tions fac­ing stiffer fines for data breaches.</p>
    <p>We must take all nec­es­sary steps to main­tain a high stan­dard of pro­bity and com­pe­tence in the ad­min­is­tra­tion of justice in Sin­ga­pore that en­joys the con­fi­dence of fel­low Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>MR MURALI PIL­LAI (Bukit Ba­tok), who is the chair­man of the Gov­ern­ment Par­lia­men­tary Com­mit­tee for Home Af­fairs and Law.</p>
