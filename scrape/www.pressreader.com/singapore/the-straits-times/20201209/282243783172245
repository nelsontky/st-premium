    <p>The world has been dragged fur­ther back from the goal of uni­ver­sal fi­nan­cial in­clu­sion by the Covid-19 pan­demic, said Mi­crosoft co-founder Bill Gates at the Sin­ga­pore Fin­tech Fes­ti­val yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The bil­lion­aire phi­lan­thropist said in an on­line ses­sion that the pan­demic had been a huge set­back, hit­ting health sys­tems and ed­u­ca­tion and af­fect­ing fi­nan­cial and eco­nomic sta­bil­ity world­wide.</p>
    <p>“Once we get the vac­cines out on a broad ba­sis, I’m op­ti­mistic that we will re­sume the growth that we had be­fore. So I’m not try­ing to be neg­a­tive. But yes, we are not go­ing to be as far along, say by 2030, as we would have been with­out the pan­demic,” said Mr Gates, who heads the Bill and Melinda Gates Foun­da­tion with his wife.</p>
    <p>It is the world’s largest pri­vate char­i­ta­ble or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Fi­nan­cial in­clu­sion is de­fined by the World Bank as ac­cess to dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices crit­i­cal for both poverty re­duc­tion and op­por­tu­ni­ties for eco­nomic growth.</p>
    <p>Mr Gates said to­day, more than 1.7 bil­lion peo­ple live out­side the for­mal fi­nan­cial sec­tor and the gap be­tween the de­vel­oped and un­der­de­vel­oped coun­tries is huge in terms of ac­cess to even ba­sic ser­vices such as bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>While 94 per cent of adults have a bank ac­count in higher-in­come coun­tries, only 35 per cent in low­er­in­come na­tions do so, he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Gates said that 70 per cent of his foun­da­tion’s re­sources are com­mit­ted to health­care and re­lated sci­en­tific re­search.</p>
    <p>But given the strong link­ages be­tween ac­cess to high qual­ity and af­ford­able fi­nan­cial ser­vices and poverty al­le­vi­a­tion, the foun­da­tion has in­creased its fo­cus on ways to de­liver these ser­vices to the poor – prof­itably and at scale – by us­ing dig­i­tal pay­ment plat­forms.</p>
    <p>His foun­da­tion also works with part­ner or­gan­i­sa­tions to as­sist reg­u­la­tors, such as cen­tral banks, that are ex­plor­ing pol­icy op­tions for en­abling the devel­op­ment of in­clu­sive dig­i­tal fi­nan­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>On health­care, Mr Gates said his foun­da­tion is work­ing with phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies and govern­ments in de­vel­op­ing coun­tries with the goal to de­liver as many Covid-19 vac­cines as pos­si­ble through next year.</p>
    <p>“Our goal is to get these vac­cines out as much as pos­si­ble within 2021, so that even in the de­vel­op­ing coun­tries the pan­demic is over by some time in 2022,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We need to make sure we do this (vac­ci­na­tion) in an eq­ui­table way so that it is not how rich you are that de­ter­mines whether you get ac­cess to this vac­cine. That’s where our foun­da­tion comes in,” he added.</p>
