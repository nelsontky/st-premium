    <p>A Chi­nook heli­copter from the Re­pub­lic of Sin­ga­pore Air Force (RSAF) has made its first land­ing on an Aus­tralian ship, a move which demon­strates the trust and in­ter­op­er­abil­ity be­tween the two sides and could lead to bet­ter co­op­er­a­tion in times of cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The land­ing of the CH-47D Chi­nook, from the RSAF’s Oakey De­tach­ment in Queens­land, Aus­tralia, on the land­ing heli­copter dock ship HMAS Adelaide took place in the wa­ters off Townsville last Saturday. The de­fence min­istries of both coun­tries said the move demon­strated the close­ness of the two armed forces and their abil­ity to work to­gether.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post on Tues­day, the Min­istry of De­fence said land­ing on a ship was not easy as it in­volves pre­cise ma­noeu­vres and team­work due to chal­leng­ing con­di­tions at sea.</p>
    <p>“The deck land­ing is a re­flec­tion of the high lev­els of co­op­er­a­tion and in­ter­op­er­abil­ity be­tween the two mil­i­taries,” it said.</p>
    <p>The event was part of the lead-up to the com­mem­o­ra­tion of 30 years of Sin­ga­pore Armed Forces train­ing in Shoal­wa­ter Bay Train­ing Area,</p>
    <p>Queens­land, later this year.</p>
    <p>Oakey De­tach­ment Com­man­der, Lieu­tenant-Colonel Jimmy Neo, said: “It means a lot to Oakey De­tach­ment for the suc­cess­ful cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of our CH-47D to land on the HMAS Adelaide.</p>
    <p>“It is another mile­stone that high­lights the mu­tual trust and pro­fes­sion­al­ism be­tween our crews and reaf­firms the in­ter­op­er­abil­ity be­tween both armed forces,” he said in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>Oakey is home to the RSAF’s CH-47D heli­copter de­tach­ment, as well as RSAF air­men and their fam­i­lies. The de­tach­ment opened in 2018, but Sin­ga­pore has trained heli­copter crew in the ru­ral town in Queens­land since 1998.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nook can be de­ployed for var­i­ous op­er­a­tions, such as search and res­cue, trans­port­ing cargo, troop lift, fire fight­ing, and hu­man­i­tar­ian aid and dis­as­ter re­lief mis­sions.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Sun­day, Aus­tralian De­fence Min­is­ter Linda Reynolds said the Sin­ga­pore crew spent two days fly­ing from Townsville to HMAS Adelaide – which is among Aus­tralia’s largest ves­sels – to un­der­take the deck­land­ing qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>These in­cluded com­mu­ni­cat­ing with the war­ship’s flight con­trol room and be­ing guided by Aus­tralian sailors on the flight deck. A to­tal of 34 RSAF per­son­nel were in­volved in the op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>The Aus­tralian min­is­ter said the move was a clear demon­stra­tion of the close­ness of the friend­ship be­tween the two coun­tries, as well as the in­creas­ing in­ter­op­er­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>“The abil­ity to op­er­ate our largest am­phibi­ous ves­sels with Sin­ga­pore’s CH-47 Chi­nook he­li­copters means we can work to­gether to mo­bilise and move per­son­nel or sup­plies at sea, and en­hance our com­bined joint ca­pa­bil­ity,” added Ms Reynolds, who made her in­tro­duc­tory visit to Sin­ga­pore last week.</p>
    <p>She noted that the heli­copter was the same air­craft that came to Aus­tralia’s aid early this year dur­ing the bush fire emer­gency, and this un­der­scored the util­ity of be­ing able to op­er­ate with Sin­ga­pore in a cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“We will al­ways be grate­ful for Sin­ga­pore’s as­sis­tance dur­ing our time of need,” she added.</p>
