    <p>A man­ag­ing di­rec­tor and his Sin­ga­pore-based whole­sale trad­ing com­pany un­law­fully sup­plied goods – mainly wines and spir­its – worth more than $745,000 to North Korea be­tween 2013 and 2018.</p>
    <p>Due to United Na­tions sanc­tions, it is il­le­gal for anyone in Sin­ga­pore to sup­ply, sell or trans­fer des­ig­nated lux­ury items to North Korean en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­porean Lim Cheng Hwee, 49, was jailed for two months yes­ter­day af­ter he pleaded guilty to three counts of un­law­fully sup­ply­ing the al­co­holic bev­er­ages worth over $530,000 to North Korea.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, SINSMS, which is also a freight for­warder, was fined $30,000 af­ter it was con­victed of three sim­i­lar charges.</p>
    <p>Lim and the com­pany each faced six other charges linked to the re­main­ing amount. They were con­sid­ered dur­ing sen­tenc­ing.</p>
    <p>Lim’s wife Hong Leng Ooi, also 49, who helped him with the firm’s ad­min­is­tra­tive op­er­a­tions, was fined $4,000 yes­ter­day. The Sin­ga­porean pleaded guilty to two counts of fail­ing to in­form the au­thor­i­ties about the un­law­ful deals.</p>
    <p>Lim’s al­leged ac­com­plices are Chi­nese na­tional Liang Ye, 44, who was a di­rec­tor and share­holder of SINSMS, and North Korean Mun</p>
    <p>Chol My­ong, 53. They are still at large.</p>
    <p>Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tors V. Je­sude­van, Koh Mun Keong and Sarah Thaker stated in court doc­u­ments that some time be­fore Oc­to­ber 2016, Mun ap­proached one Richard Goh, the di­rec­tor of a com­pany called Mega-Tech In­dus­tries, for the pur­chase of wines and spir­its to be ex­ported from Sin­ga­pore to Dalian in China.</p>
    <p>The out­come of Mr Goh’s case was not stated in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>The DPPs added: “Mega-Tech would source for the wines and spir­its or­dered by Mun. The said wines and spir­its would be stored in a li­censed ware­house in Sin­ga­pore... Af­ter Mega-Tech re­ceived full pay­ment from Mun, Me­gaTech would re­lease the wines and spir­its to SINSMS, the freight for­warders ap­pointed by Mun.”</p>
    <p>The court heard that Mun also in­formed Lim that the al­co­holic bev­er­ages to be shipped by SINSMS to Dalian were bound for North Korea. Lim then in­structed his firm to ar­range for their freight from Sin­ga­pore to Dalian.</p>
    <p>Liang then ar­ranged for the goods to be sent to Nampo in North Korea, the court heard.</p>
    <p>On her part, Hong took in­struc­tions from her hus­band and over­saw the ad­min­is­tra­tive de­tails for the sup­ply of the goods to North Korea.</p>
