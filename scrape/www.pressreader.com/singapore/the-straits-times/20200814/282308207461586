    <p>From the tulip skirt to the Trib­ute heels, Ital­ian de­signer Ste­fano Pi­lati’s eight-year ten­ure at Yves Saint Lau­rent yielded plenty of com­mer­cial hits and an al­lur­ing take on French chic.</p>
    <p>He fol­lowed that up with three years at Ermenegild­o Zegna, bring­ing a softer, more lan­guid el­e­gance to the Ital­ian menswear gi­ant.</p>
    <p>Dis­il­lu­sioned with the cor­po­rate fash­ion sys­tem, Pi­lati re­treated from the pub­lic eye in 2016.</p>
    <p>He resur­faced in late 2018 with the launch of Ran­dom Iden­ti­ties – a la­bel in­spired by the en­er­getic club cul­ture of his new home city, Ber­lin.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing out of the fash­ion main­land is a con­scious de­ci­sion,” said Pi­lati to An­gelo Flac­cavento for Busi­ness of Fash­ion in April last year of his new la­bel. “Ber­lin is a city with a mod­ern men­tal­ity – a free place for free think­ing, where I can op­er­ate in my own bub­ble and do my own thing the way I want to do it, at my own pace.”</p>
    <p>From the get-go, Ran­dom Iden­ti­ties stood out for how dif­fer­ent it was from the old lux­ury model in which Pi­lati used to op­er­ate. Dur­ing his hia­tus, the de­signer has come to see lux­ury as some­thing de­fined not by pric­ing, but by qual­ity, scarcity and its value to its in­tended au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>As such, the brand does not play by con­ven­tional fash­ion rules. Prices hover around $100 to $800 and there are no sea­sonal col­lec­tions, lav­ish run­way shows, splashy cam­paigns, flag­ship store, e-com­merce or de­lin­eation be­tween the sexes.</p>
    <p>In­stead, its pieces are gen­der­less and re­leased in the­matic drops – way be­fore singer Ri­hanna adopted the model for her LVMH-backed Fenty la­bel – with dis­tri­bu­tion limited to Ssense on­line and the Dover Street Mar­ket net­work off­line.</p>
    <p>What con­nects each cap­sule is a dis­tinct mix of the util­i­tar­ian and mil­i­taris­tic un­der­cut with a touch of sub­ver­sion and kink – clothes that would fit right in at Ber­lin’s iconic techno club Berghain.</p>
    <p>In a sign that Pi­lati’s game-chang­ing gam­bit has caught on with the in­dus­try at large, Ran­dom Iden­ti­ties was in­vited by the world’s largest menswear trade show, Pitti Uomo, to feature as a spe­cial guest at its Jan­uary edi­tion – giv­ing the de­signer a larger plat­form to broad­cast his rad­i­cal mes­sage and prov­ing that one does not have to con­form in or­der to win.</p>
