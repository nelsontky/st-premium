    <p>When Chi­nese busi­ness­man Wang Xi first gam­bled at Shel­don Adel­son’s Ma­rina Bay Sands casino in Sin­ga­pore, he hit the jack­pot, win­ning US$3.7 mil­lion (S$4.9 mil­lion). Af­ter more wins in later trips, his luck turned sour and he racked up mil­lions in losses.</p>
    <p>Af­ter one par­tic­u­larly tough day in the high-roller room, he threw a wa­ter glass at a staff mem­ber, and brought his fa­ther in to re­view his ac­counts, ac­cord­ing to doc­u­ments seen by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>The fam­ily probe yielded a wind­fall of a dif­fer­ent sort.</p>
    <p>In a law­suit last year, Mr Wang claimed Ma­rina Bay Sands had trans­ferred $9.1 mil­lion of his money to third par­ties in 22 sep­a­rate transactio­ns with­out his au­tho­ri­sa­tion. The forms for wiring his money were not signed by him and ap­pear to have been forged, with the orig­i­nals de­stroyed, ac­cord­ing to the suit.</p>
    <p>The casino set­tled the case in June and re­paid Mr Wang, with­out ad­mit­ting wrong­do­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Wang’s suit and sim­i­lar ones shone a light on the murky world of third-party trans­fers that casi­nos and gam­blers use to set­tle ac­counts.</p>
    <p>Since gam­bling is il­le­gal on the Chi­nese main­land, so-called jun­ket op­er­a­tors have stepped in to fa­cil­i­tate it, es­pe­cially in Ma­cau, a favourite for Chi­nese gam­blers.</p>
    <p>It is not easy for Chi­nese cit­i­zens to wire money abroad, so in ad­di­tion to book­ing five-star ho­tels and pri­vate jets, jun­ket op­er­a­tors of­ten act as an in­for­mal bank, pro­vid­ing gam­blers with credit, stash­ing win­nings and set­tling losses with casi­nos and other bet­tors.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, Ma­rina Bay Sands pro­hibits the use of th­ese jun­kets, con­cerned that the un­trace­able flow of money opens the door to money laun­der­ing. In­stead, the casino al­lows pa­trons to trans­fer money to other gam­blers they know, cov­er­ing losses or shar­ing win­nings. Think of it as an in­for­mal lend­ing club among mil­lion­aires.</p>
    <p>For the casino, the so-called let­ters of au­tho­ri­sa­tion seemed like a way to avoid the jun­kets while still fa­cil­i­tat­ing gam­bling by the “whales” who gen­er­ate so much profit for its busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Third-party trans­fers, which are le­gal, have been used by the casino for years, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>An in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion showed 3,419 trans­fers worth $1.64 bil­lion were shuf­fled among gam­blers by casino em­ploy­ees from Oc­to­ber 2010 to De­cem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>A prob­lem for Ma­rina Bay Sands is that sev­eral em­ploy­ees ap­pear to have hi­jacked the process from about 2013 to 2018. They would get the pa­trons to sign a blank au­tho­ri­sa­tion form to get things started, then fill in the amount of the trans­fer and other de­tails for sub­se­quent wires.</p>
    <p>At times they would use pho­to­copies of the same doc­u­ment on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions to ex­pe­dite the moves, copy sig­na­tures if needed, and de­stroy the orig­i­nals af­ter the funds were sent, the peo­ple say.</p>
    <p>The Ma­rina Bay Sands man­age­ment was largely un­aware of the trans­fer prob­lem un­til 2018, ac­cord­ing to a former com­pli­ance ex­ec­u­tive who was in­ter­viewed as part of an in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>When the ex­ec­u­tive brought up the is­sue and tried to tackle it, the op­er­a­tions and le­gal teams urged him to back off. Later, his con­tract was not re­newed, the of­fi­cial told the law firm con­duct­ing the probe.</p>
    <p>Ma­rina Bay Sands said it has cut back on third-party trans­fers and tight­ened se­cu­rity over their use. Doc­u­ments seen by Bloomberg show the amount of trans­fers dropped to just six in 2018 from a peak of 1,011 in 2014.</p>
    <p>In a June let­ter to Sin­ga­pore’s casino reg­u­la­tor, Ma­rina Bay Sands said it took steps in 2018 to in­crease its scru­tiny of all trans­fers, and fur­ther beefed up the mea­sures this year.</p>
    <p>Th­ese steps in­cluded en­sur­ing that all trans­fer let­ters had fresh “wet ink” sig­na­tures and that staff re­ceived a ver­bal con­fir­ma­tion from the pa­tron be­fore mov­ing any funds.</p>
    <p>Third-party trans­fers “are sub­ject to en­hanced due dili­gence checks which will in­clude screen­ing of the pa­tron and third party for jun­ket af­fil­i­a­tion and dec­la­ra­tion of the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the pa­trons and the rea­sons for the pa­tron mak­ing the third-party pay­ment”, the casino wrote. “MBS (Ma­rina Bay Sands) re­mains fo­cused on hav­ing high­est-level best prac­tices of gov­er­nance, com­pli­ance and in­ter­nal con­trols that are con­tin­u­ously im­proved.”</p>
    <p>Unau­tho­rised trans­fers were not the casino’s only prob­lem be­fore they were dealt with start­ing in 2018. While Ma­rina Bay Sands’ pol­icy is not to deal with jun­kets, some rogue em­ploy­ees were work­ing with th­ese op­er­a­tors to at­tract Chi­nese gam­blers, ac­cord­ing to doc­u­ments re­viewed by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>There have been cases in which Chi­nese clients said they set­tled their gam­bling ac­counts through the jun­kets, which did not pass along the money to the casino, re­sult­ing in un­col­lected debts and sub­se­quent le­gal ac­tion.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, in 2018, Ma­rina Bay Sands sued a cus­tomer named Luo Shan­dong, seek­ing re­pay­ment of $3.5 mil­lion in gam­bling debts and in­ter­est, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments. Mr Luo said he paid the money through Tian Du Gam­ing Pro­mo­tion, a jun­ket com­pany that op­er­ated in the casino’s VIP lounge. He said Tian Du pro­vided him with credit and col­lected re­pay­ments on be­half of Ma­rina Bay Sands. The casino de­nied the con­nec­tion.</p>
    <p>A Sands col­lec­tions ex­ec­u­tive said it was com­mon for pa­trons to in­form the casino that they had paid a third party. The ex­ec­u­tive would then be obliged to in­form them that they had paid the wrong party, ac­cord­ing to the in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>The whales are the big mon­ey­mak­ers for casi­nos, and some em­ploy­ees said they needed to work with jun­kets to at­tract them. One former mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive said that when Sands Sin­ga­pore opened, it needed to call in the jun­kets be­cause of a lack of lo­cal con­tacts.</p>
    <p>While it is not clear how much money the unau­tho­rised trans­fers and un­paid debts cost Ma­rina Bay Sands, from 2013 to March this year, the casino wrote off US$717 mil­lion from 928 ac­counts, ac­cord­ing to an in­ter­nal doc­u­ment seen by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>A former Sands ex­ec­u­tive said typ­i­cal losses for a casino that size are US$20 mil­lion to US$30 mil­lion a year. The peak write-offs were in the pe­riod from 2015 to 2017, the years im­me­di­ately fol­low­ing the big­gest trans­fers, while 67 per cent of the dol­lar value was tied to Chi­nese clients, the doc­u­ment shows.</p>
    <p>The casino de­nied the trans­fers con­trib­uted to the write-downs.</p>
    <p>“Third-party trans­fers are part of the or­di­nary course of busi­ness within our in­dus­try. We re­main con­fi­dent that the pro­cesses we have in place re­lat­ing to such trans­fers are se­cure, with ap­pro­pri­ate lev­els of au­tho­ri­sa­tion and con­trols,” the casino said in a state­ment to Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>“By the same to­ken, be­cause pa­trons some­times fi­nance their play at our prop­erty by bor­row­ing funds which they then fail to re­pay, write-downs are not un­com­mon in our busi­ness,” the casino added. “Any sug­ges­tion that write-downs are com­monly the re­sult of third­party trans­fers, or that write­downs at our prop­erty ex­ceed in­dus­try norms, is in­ac­cu­rate.”</p>
    <p>Ma­rina Bay Sands re­mains un­der scru­tiny. The United States De­part­ment of Jus­tice (DOJ) is re­view­ing whether the casino breached money laun­der­ing con­trols in its treat­ment of high rollers and re­tal­i­ated against whis­tle-blow­ers who are cur­rent or former em­ploy­ees, ac­cord­ing to a Jan­uary sub­poena is­sued to a former chief com­pli­ance of­fi­cer at the casino.</p>
    <p>The US At­tor­ney’s Of­fice in Las Ve­gas de­clined to com­ment about the Jus­tice De­part­ment probe.</p>
    <p>“Ma­rina Bay Sands is com­mit­ted to run­ning a best-in-class com­pli­ance pro­gramme and has ded­i­cated sig­nif­i­cant re­sources to de­vel­op­ing the ro­bust pro­gramme cur­rently in place,” the casino said in the state­ment to Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>“As part of that pro­gramme, we eval­u­ate our in­ter­nal poli­cies on a reg­u­lar ba­sis and make changes where our com­pli­ance and busi­ness goals are not be­ing achieved or our busi­ness val­ues are not be­ing met.”</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore po­lice force is also prob­ing the trans­fers in the wake of the Wang case, and the casino has hired another law firm – Davin­der Singh Cham­bers – to con­duct an in­ves­ti­ga­tion into the em­ployee wires.</p>
    <p>The Casino Reg­u­la­tory Au­thor­ity has com­pleted its in­ves­ti­ga­tions, and there are no on­go­ing re­views, a spokesman for the agency said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore had early reser­va­tions about casi­nos. Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong was wor­ried that gam­bling would bring “un­de­sir­able ac­tiv­i­ties” – money laun­der­ing and or­gan­ised crime, namely – to the is­land off the tip of Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Bil­lion­aire Adel­son, the 23rdrich­est per­son in the US, ac­cen­tu­ated the pos­i­tive af­ter Sin­ga­pore ended its casino ban: thou­sands of jobs, bil­lions of dol­lars in tourism rev­enue, and a chance for Sin­ga­pore to shed its rep­u­ta­tion as one of the sleepier places in Asia.</p>
    <p>A decade later, it ap­pears both sides may have been right. Ma­rina Bay Sands is a run­away suc­cess. Covid-19 not­with­stand­ing, it is one of the most prof­itable casi­nos in the world based on mar­gins, ac­count­ing for a third of earn­ings at Mr Adel­son’s Las Ve­gas Sands Corp.</p>
    <p>Asian bet­tors have flocked to the 600 game ta­bles and 1,500 slot ma­chines spread over four cav­ernous, smoke-filled floors, with goldtrimme­d fix­tures that are a cut above the more pedes­trian halls of Ma­cau.</p>
    <p>While pa­trons in the up­per-floor Ruby sa­lons en­joy un­lim­ited food and drink, the real money flows through the 36 pri­vate Paiza rooms that at­tract high rollers with gam­bling bud­gets as high as US$50 mil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the peo­ple fa­mil­iar with the op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>Th­ese big spenders, most of them from China, wa­ger at least $10,000 a hand and re­ceive red­car­pet treat­ment, es­corted in Mercedes-Benz S-class sedans to a dis­creet en­trance. In th­ese gilded rooms, they can bet as much as $1.5 mil­lion at bac­carat, the pre­ferred card game in Asia that re­lies more on luck than on skill.</p>
    <p>There is so much money flow­ing through the halls that one of the gam­blers stores US$17 mil­lion worth of wine in the cel­lars at the casino’s Im­pe­rial Palace restau­rant, a per­son fa­mil­iar said.</p>
    <p>Away from the gam­ing ta­bles, the Moshe Safdie-de­signed com­plex of three curved ho­tel tow­ers linked by a boat-shaped canopy with an in­fin­ity pool has be­come the city’s tourism icon, fea­tured in the Hol­ly­wood hit Crazy Rich Asians.</p>
    <p>And while Sin­ga­pore­ans are wel­come to shop in the com­plex’s mall, ex­plore the ArtS­cience Mu­seum on-site and sip whiskies at the rooftop Ce La Vi bar, they are dis­cour­aged from ac­tu­ally gam­bling. They must pay a $150 fee just to en­ter the casino, eu­phemisti­cally known as an “in­te­grated re­sort”, to ac­cen­tu­ate the fam­ily fun. Vis­i­tors are hard-pressed to find a “casino” sign any­where.</p>
    <p>Mr Adel­son is showing no signs of pulling back. In fact, he is dou­bling down in Asia while ex­plor­ing a sale of his Las Ve­gas prop­er­ties, peo­ple fa­mil­iar say. He has al­ready com­mit­ted to a US$3.3 bil­lion ex­pan­sion of Ma­rina Bay Sands, which will in­clude a fourth ho­tel tower, a 15,000-seat arena and a con­ven­tion cen­tre.</p>
    <p>“His­tory has shown us that th­ese busi­nesses are, to an ex­tent, too big to fail,” said Mr Ben Lee, the Ma­cau-based manag­ing part­ner at IGamiX. Las Ve­gas Sands “al­ready had a cou­ple of run-ins with the DOJ, which re­sulted in mi­nor fines, a slap on the wrist, and then busi­ness as usual.”</p>
    <p>The whales are the big mon­ey­mak­ers for casi­nos, and some em­ploy­ees said they needed to work with jun­kets to at­tract them. One former mar­ket­ing ex­ec­u­tive said that when Sands Sin­ga­pore opened, it needed to call in the jun­kets be­cause of a lack of lo­cal con­tacts.</p>
    <p>Th­ese big spenders, most of them from China, wa­ger at least $10,000 a hand and re­ceive red-car­pet treat­ment, es­corted in Mercedes-Benz S-class sedans to a dis­creet en­trance. In th­ese gilded rooms they can bet as much as $1.5 mil­lion at bac­carat, the pre­ferred card game in Asia that re­lies more on luck than on skill.</p>
