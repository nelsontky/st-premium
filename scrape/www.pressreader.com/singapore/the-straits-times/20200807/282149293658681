    <p>While other firms have had to re­sort to mass lay­offs amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Chi­nese tech com­pany Black Sesame Tech­nolo­gies plans to more than dou­ble its head­count in Sin­ga­pore within 11/</p>
    <p>2 years.</p>
    <p>The ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) and au­to­mo­tive chip de­vel­oper is ac­tively re­cruit­ing AI tal­ent and hopes to in­crease the num­ber of em­ploy­ees from 20 now to 50 by the end of next year, said the firm’s Sin­ga­pore gen­eral man­ager Xu Jin.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times in a video call, Mr Xu added that the fo­cus will be on hir­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents for its re­search and de­vel­op­ment (R&D) cen­tre here – the com­pany’s only one out­side of the United States.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore has a lot of tal­ent we can tap to grow our deep-tech and ma­chine-learn­ing com­pe­ten­cies,” he said.</p>
    <p>The firm’s chief ex­ec­u­tive Johnson Shan said, dur­ing the same call, that the firm is mostly look­ing for engi­neers and re­searchers with skills in writ­ing im­age pro­cess­ing al­go­rithms.</p>
    <p>He did not rule out the pos­si­bil­ity of hir­ing fresh grad­u­ates and train­ing them, if they lack the work ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>“We plan to build a big of­fice here. Sin­ga­pore has a vi­brant in­no­va­tion en­vi­ron­ment, and the Gov­ern­ment is very sup­port­ive of tech start-ups like ours. I be­lieve it will be ben­e­fi­cial for the growth of our R&D ca­pa­bil­i­ties,” said Mr Shan.</p>
    <p>He added that the com­pany, which is lo­cated in one-north, is com­mit­ting be­tween $50 mil­lion and $100 mil­lion over the next five years to ex­pand op­er­a­tions here.</p>
    <p>In June, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat an­nounced in a tele­vised speech that the Gov­ern­ment was set­ting aside more than $20 bil­lion to sup­port ba­sic and ap­plied re­search in high-im­pact ar­eas such as AI.</p>
    <p>Black Sesame, which raised US$100 mil­lion (S$137 mil­lion) in its Se­ries B fi­nanc­ing round last year, is known for its vis­ual per­cep­tion so­lu­tions used for au­ton­o­mous driv­ing and ad­vanced driver-as­sis­tance sys­tems. For ex­am­ple, it has de­vel­oped in-ve­hi­cle mon­i­tor­ing sys­tems with fa­cial recog­ni­tion ca­pa­bil­i­ties, which can mon­i­tor driver fa­tigue and poor driv­ing be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>In June, the com­pany re­leased au­to­mo­tive chips that can sup­port lev­els three and above of au­ton­o­mous driv­ing.</p>
    <p>Level three means that ve­hi­cles can make in­formed de­ci­sions but still re­quire hu­man over­rides, while level four ve­hi­cles can op­er­ate in self-driv­ing mode within limited ar­eas.</p>
