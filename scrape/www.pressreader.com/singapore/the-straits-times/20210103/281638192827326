    <p>Shore-based staff in the mar­itime sec­tor will now have to be tested ev­ery seven days in­stead of 14 be­fore they are al­lowed to board ships for work.</p>
    <p>This is among the mea­sures tight­ened for the test­ing of all shore­based staff go­ing on board ships, in the light of two cases in which a marine sur­veyor and a har­bour pi­lot tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19, said the Mar­itime and Port Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The more than 20,000 shore­based staff here will need to take a Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion test by Fri­day, to give as­sur­ance that they are clear of the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>MPA also said all shore-based staff are re­quired to give the au­thor­ity ad­vance no­tice be­fore they board ships to carry out works or pro­vide ser­vices. It said firm ac­tion will be taken against a ship’s owner, mas­ter or agent if there is non-com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­ity, the Eco­nomic De­vel­op­ment Board (EDB) and other agen­cies will be step­ping up checks to en­sure Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures are ad­hered to, said MPA.</p>
    <p>“In­di­vid­u­als and com­pa­nies which are found to have vi­o­lated these mea­sures will be taken to task. Agen­cies will also re­view the need to en­hance per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment and in­fec­tion con­trol mea­sures in the sec­tor,” it said.</p>
    <p>The tight­ened rules for the marine sec­tor come af­ter a sim­i­lar move for air­line crew, fol­low­ing news that a Sin­ga­pore Air­lines cabin crew mem­ber and a pi­lot had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are also in­ves­ti­gat­ing a pos­si­ble breach of Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures for the cases in the marine sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­veal that the marine sur­veyor, like the marine ser­vice en­gi­neer who tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in­fec­tion ear­lier on Nov 26, 2020, con­sumed food pro­vided by or with the crew on board the ships, which was against a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure,” said MPA.</p>
    <p>“MPA, EDB and the Min­istry of Health take a se­ri­ous view of non­com­pli­ance with Covid-19 safe man­age­ment mea­sures and will not hes­i­tate to take firm ac­tions against the er­rant com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als,” added the au­thor­ity.</p>
    <p>MPA has also stopped Mas­ter Sys­tems Marine from send­ing its staff to work on board ships af­ter the case in­volv­ing its em­ployee, the marine ser­vice en­gi­neer, was de­tected. The halt will con­tinue till the firm is able to demon­strate that its em­ploy­ees will ad­here to safe man­age­ment mea­sures on board ships.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the case in­volv­ing the marine sur­veyor from Lloyd’s Reg­is­ter Sin­ga­pore, the firm has sus­pended all ship­board sur­vey and au­dit ac­tiv­i­ties and will be test­ing all its marine sur­vey­ors for Covid-19, said MPA.</p>
    <p>It added that fur­ther ac­tion may be taken against the com­pa­nies and in­di­vid­u­als af­ter in­ves­ti­ga­tions are com­pleted.</p>
