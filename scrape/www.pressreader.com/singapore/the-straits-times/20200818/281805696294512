    <p>WASHINGTON • The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion an­nounced yes­ter­day it will fur­ther tighten re­stric­tions on Huawei Tech­nolo­gies, aimed at crack­ing down on its access to com­mer­cially avail­able chips.</p>
    <p>The US Com­merce Depart­ment ac­tions, first re­ported by Reuters, will ex­pand re­stric­tions an­nounced in May and aimed at pre­vent­ing the Chi­nese telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions gi­ant from ob­tain­ing semi­con­duc­tors with­out a spe­cial li­cence – in­clud­ing chips made by for­eign firms that have been de­vel­oped or pro­duced with US soft­ware or tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion will also add 38 Huawei af­fil­i­ates in 21 coun­tries to the US govern­ment’s eco­nomic black­list, the sources said, raising the to­tal to 152 af­fil­i­ates since Huawei was first added in May last year.</p>
    <p>US Com­merce Sec­re­tary Wil­bur Ross told Fox Busi­ness that the re­stric­tions on Huawei-de­signed chips im­posed in May “led them to do some eva­sive mea­sures. They were go­ing through third par­ties”.</p>
    <p>“The new rule makes it clear that any use of Amer­i­can soft­ware or Amer­i­can fab­ri­ca­tion equip­ment is banned and re­quires a li­cence,” added Mr Ross.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo said the rule change “will pre­vent Huawei from cir­cum­vent­ing US law through al­ter­na­tive chip pro­duc­tion and pro­vi­sion of off-theshelf chips”.</p>
    <p>He added in a state­ment that “Huawei has con­tin­u­ously tried to evade” the US re­stric­tions im­posed in May.</p>
    <p>Huawei did not im­me­di­ately com­ment.</p>
    <p>With US-China re­la­tions at their worst in decades, Washington is push­ing gov­ern­ments around to world to squeeze Huawei out, ar­gu­ing that the com­pany would hand over data to the Chi­nese govern­ment for spy­ing. Huawei de­nies that it spies for China.</p>
    <p>The new ac­tions, ef­fec­tive im­me­di­ately, should pre­vent Huawei’s at­tempts to cir­cum­vent US ex­port con­trols. It “makes clear that we’re cov­er­ing off-the-shelf de­signs that Huawei may be seek­ing to pur­chase from a third-party de­sign house”, one Com­merce Depart­ment official told Reuters.</p>
    <p>A new sep­a­rate rule re­quires com­pa­nies on the eco­nomic black­list to ob­tain a li­cence when a com­pany like Huawei on the list acts</p>
    <p>“as a pur­chaser, in­ter­me­di­ate con­signee, ul­ti­mate con­signee or end user”.</p>
    <p>The US depart­ment also con­firmed that it will not ex­tend a tem­po­rary gen­eral li­cence that ex­pired last Fri­day for users of Huawei devices and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tion providers. Par­ties must now sub­mit li­cence ap­pli­ca­tions for transactio­ns pre­vi­ously au­tho­rised.</p>
    <p>The Com­merce Depart­ment is adopt­ing a lim­ited per­ma­nent au­tho­ri­sa­tion for Huawei en­ti­ties to al­low “on­go­ing se­cu­rity re­search crit­i­cal to main­tain­ing the in­tegrity and re­li­a­bil­ity of ex­ist­ing” net­works and equip­ment.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing US re­stric­tions have al­ready had a heavy im­pact on Huawei and its sup­pli­ers. The May re­stric­tions do not fully go into ef­fect un­til Sept 14.</p>
    <p>On Aug 8, fi­nan­cial mag­a­zine Caixin re­ported that Huawei will stop making its flag­ship Kirin chipsets next month due to US pres­sure on sup­pli­ers.</p>
    <p>Huawei’s HiSil­i­con di­vi­sion has re­lied on soft­ware from US com­pa­nies such as Ca­dence De­sign Sys­tems and Synop­sys to de­sign its chips, and out­sourced the pro­duc­tion to Tai­wan Semi­con­duc­tor Man­u­fac­tur­ing Co (TSMC), which uses equip­ment from US com­pa­nies. TSMC has said it will not ship wafers to Huawei af­ter Sept 15.</p>
