    <p>As Sin­ga­pore re­sets its econ­omy to nav­i­gate a post-pandemic world, it has de­cided to take a fresh ap­proach to growth and ini­ti­ated sev­eral projects that could hold the key to the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>These range from the safe and grad­ual re­sump­tion of large-scale con­fer­ences to a trial of au­ton­o­mous shut­tles, re­vealed the Emerg­ing Stronger Task­force (EST), six months af­ter it started ex­plor­ing new ideas to reignite the econ­omy.</p>
    <p>The EST is also adding a new area of fo­cus, med­i­cal tech­nol­ogy, which will look into de­vel­op­ing di­ag­nos­tics for dis­eases like Covid-19 and cancer. It is also looking at tieups with South-east Asian part­ners.</p>
    <p>Giv­ing an up­date on the work of the task force yesterday, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat noted that it has taken a new ap­proach to col­lab­o­ra­tion un­der which in­dus­try-led groups dubbed Sin­ga­pore To­gether Al­liances for Ac­tion are given lee­way – much like start-ups – to pro­to­type new ideas.</p>
    <p>“This is in keep­ing with the spirit of Sin­ga­pore To­gether, where we work in part­ner­ship to achieve more than the sum of our parts,” said Mr Heng, re­fer­ring to the move­ment he and his fourth-gen­er­a­tion col­leagues started to give cit­i­zens more say in pol­i­cy­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>“This new ap­proach to eco­nomic growth will pro­pel our econ­omy through Covid into a new nor­mal post-pandemic,” he added.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the task force said at a press con­fer­ence that this has al­lowed the pri­vate and pub­lic sec­tors to work along­side each other as part­ners – rather than as reg­u­la­tors and the reg­u­lated.</p>
    <p>PSA In­ter­na­tional group chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Tan Chong Meng, an EST co-chair, de­scribed it as “cross­ing the stream while feel­ing the stones”, rather than feel­ing all the stones and map­ping out the way be­fore cross­ing the stream.</p>
    <p>This has borne fruit. A project by the meet­ings, in­cen­tive travel, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions al­liance, to pi­lot rapid test­ing at mass events, saw all vis­i­tors to last month’s Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week tested on the spot be­fore be­ing al­lowed into the venue.</p>
    <p>The al­liance on ro­bot­ics has ini­ti­ated a project which will see early ver­sions of au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles de­ployed by the end of the year.</p>
    <p>And the al­liance on sup­ply chains has brought to­gether 50 or­gan­i­sa­tions to cre­ate a set of data stan­dards that will al­low dif­fer­ent seg­ments of the sup­ply chain ecosys­tem to work to­gether.</p>
    <p>The other four al­liances are looking at sus­tain­abil­ity, dig­i­tal­is­ing the built en­vi­ron­ment, smart com­merce and ed­u­ca­tion tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>In all, the seven al­liances have col­lec­tively en­gaged over 600 peo­ple and over 330 busi­nesses, trade as­so­ci­a­tions and cham­bers, and pub­lic agen­cies, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for Na­tional Devel­op­ment Desmond Lee, the other EST co-chair, said this ag­ile ap­proach to col­lab­o­ra­tion can be a com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage for Sin­ga­pore and may soon be­come the norm.</p>
    <p>He added that it is key to be nim­ble as the task force has iden­ti­fied six shifts in the global econ­omy from which op­por­tu­ni­ties will emerge: A chang­ing global or­der; a re­bal­ance be­tween ef­fi­ciency and re­silience in sup­ply chains and pro­duc­tion; dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion and in­no­va­tion; changes in con­sumer pref­er­ences; greater fo­cus on sus­tain­abil­ity; and ac­cel­er­at­ing in­dus­try con­sol­i­da­tion and churn.</p>
    <p>In nav­i­gat­ing these shifts, the task force is guided by two themes, Mr Lee said, that must un­der­pin the fu­ture econ­omy: A Sin­ga­pore that is con­nected to the world, and one that is sus­tain­able for the en­vi­ron­ment and in­clu­sive for its peo­ple.</p>
    <p>He called on peo­ple to share their ideas through the EST’s new web­site emerg­ingstronge­r.sg, saying: “The EST needs both the sup­port and the ideas and cre­ativ­ity of Sin­ga­pore­ans to build a Sin­ga­pore that en­ables vir­tu­ally un­lim­ited pos­si­bil­i­ties.”</p>
