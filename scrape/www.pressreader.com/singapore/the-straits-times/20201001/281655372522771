    <p>MANILA • The Philip­pine cen­tral bank said it will ban from the in­dus­try for­mer bank em­ploy­ees who al­legedly fal­si­fied doc­u­ments for Ger­man pay­ment com­pany Wire­card.</p>
    <p>Bangko Sen­tral ng Pilip­inas is adding the for­mer bankers to a list of peo­ple dis­qual­i­fied from be­com­ing direc­tors or of­fi­cers at any su­per­vised fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion, it said in an e-mail to Bloomberg yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Wire­card filed for bank­ruptcy in June af­ter ac­knowl­edg­ing that €1.9 bil­lion (S$3.05 bil­lion) it had listed as as­sets did not ex­ist, trig­ger­ing an in­ves­ti­ga­tion that has spanned re­gions from Europe to Asia.</p>
    <p>BDO Uni­bank and Bank of the Philip­pine Is­lands have said that rogue em­ploy­ees fal­si­fied doc­u­ments pur­port­ing to show Wire­card had de­posit ac­counts at two of the coun­try’s largest lenders.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Philip­pines’ dirty-money watch­dog said yes­ter­day that it has been co­or­di­nat­ing with the Ger­man and Sin­ga­porean au­thor­i­ties in in­ves­ti­gat­ing Wire­card and peo­ple of in­ter­est. It re­minded banks to strengthen their know-your-cus­tomer pro­to­cols.</p>
    <p>The Anti-Money Laundering Coun­cil on Sept 11 said it had iden­ti­fied 57 “per­sons of in­ter­est”, in­clud­ing for­eign­ers as well as lo­cal bank of­fi­cers and gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, whose links to Wire­card are be­ing scru­ti­nised.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Frank­furt pros­e­cu­tors are in­ves­ti­gat­ing a sub­sidiary of state lender KfW for a €100 mil­lion credit line to Wire­card.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment on Tues­day, pub­lic pros­e­cu­tors in Ger­many’s fi­nan­cial cap­i­tal said a Frank­furt-based lender had granted Wire­card the credit in 2018 and ex­tended it last year with­out re­quir­ing col­lat­eral to pro­tect against losses.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tors did not name the bank, but KfW sep­a­rately said that its sub­sidiary Ipex-Bank was the subject of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Wire­card’s ad­min­is­tra­tor is fac­ing de­clin­ing in­ter­est in the com­pany’s Ger­man as­sets af­ter an­other po­ten­tial buyer, So­lar­is­bank, fol­lowed Deutsche Bank’s lead and pulled out of the bid­ding last week.</p>
    <p>So­lar­is­bank is backed by com­pa­nies that in­clude Banco Bil­bao Viz­caya Ar­gen­taria and ABN Amro Bank.</p>
    <p>Four com­pa­nies are still in­volved in the sale process, ac­cord­ing to peo­ple with knowl­edge of the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>They in­clude Banco San­tander, Ly­camo­bile and Ital­ian pay­ment com­pany SIA as well as Hei­del­pay, the sources said.</p>
