    <p>Ja­pan yes­ter­day marked 75 years since the world’s first atomic bomb at­tack, with the coro­n­avirus pandemic forc­ing a scal­ing back of cer­e­monies to re­mem­ber the vic­tims. En­trance to this year’s memo­rial at the Peace Park in Hiroshima was limited and only sur­vivors and their fam­i­lies could at­tend. WORLD</p>
    <p>TOKYO • Bells tolled in Hiroshima yes­ter­day for the 75th an­niver­sary of the world’s first atomic bomb­ing, with cer­e­monies down­sized due to the coro­n­avirus out­break and the city’s mayor urg­ing na­tions to re­ject self­ish na­tion­al­ism and unite to fight all threats.</p>
    <p>Though thou­sands usu­ally pack the Peace Park in the cen­tre of the Ja­panese city to pray, sing and of­fer pa­per cranes as a sym­bol of peace, en­trance this year was limited and only sur­vivors and their fam­i­lies could at­tend the memo­rial.</p>
    <p>The city said the sig­nif­i­cance of the an­niver­sary of the bomb­ing that killed 140,000 peo­ple be­fore the end of 1945 had prompted its de­ci­sion to hold the cer­e­mony de­spite the spread of the virus, but tak­ing strict pre­cau­tions.</p>
    <p>“On Aug 6, 1945, a sin­gle atomic bomb de­stroyed our city. Ru­mour at the time had it that ‘noth­ing will grow here for 75 years’,” said Mayor Kazumi Mat­sui.</p>
    <p>“And yet, Hiroshima re­cov­ered, be­com­ing a sym­bol of peace.”</p>
    <p>At 8:15am on Aug 6, 1945, the US B-29 war­plane Enola Gay dropped a bomb nick­named “Lit­tle Boy” and oblit­er­ated the city with an es­ti­mated pop­u­la­tion of 350,000. Thou­sands more died later from their in­juries and ra­di­a­tion-re­lated ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day morn­ing, as ci­cadas shrilled in the heavy sum­mer heat and the Peace Bell sounded, the crowd stood to ob­serve a mo­ment of si­lence at the ex­act time that the bomb ex­ploded.</p>
    <p>“When the 1918 flu pandemic at­tacked a cen­tury ago, it took tens of mil­lions of lives and ter­rorised the world be­cause na­tions fight­ing World War I were un­able to meet the threat to­gether,” Mr Mat­sui said. “A sub­se­quent up­surge in na­tion­al­ism led to World War II and the atomic bomb­ings. We must never al­low this painful past to re­peat it­self. Civil so­ci­ety must re­ject self-cen­tred na­tion­al­ism and unite against all threats.”</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe at­tended the memo­rial as usual, but the num­ber of for­eign vis­i­tors was down. Over­all at­ten­dance was less than a tenth of the usual fig­ure, with chairs spaced far apart and most peo­ple wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>Mr Mat­sui also urged Tokyo to rat­ify a 2017 United Na­tions pact ban­ning nu­clear arms, but Mr Abe avoided any di­rect ref­er­ence, say­ing Ja­pan would “work as a bridge be­tween na­tions” to abol­ish nu­clear weapons.</p>
    <p>Ms Keiko Ogura, who was eight when the ex­plo­sion from the bomb knocked her off her feet, has ded­i­cated her life to work­ing for peace.</p>
    <p>“The nu­clear dan­ger is spread­ing around the world, and un­der that mush­room cloud, no one can es­cape,” she told a re­cent news con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The an­niver­sary was a top trend­ing topic on Ja­panese Twit­ter, with most users of­fer­ing prayers for world peace, al­though one drew a par­al­lel with the huge blast on Tues­day that killed at least 135 in Beirut, the Le­banese cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>“I re­ally hadn’t been able to imag­ine it be­fore, but look­ing at the dam­age from the Beirut ex­plo­sion and imag­in­ing some­thing sev­eral times more pow­er­ful, I was struck with a huge sense of fear,” wrote the com­menter, iden­ti­fied as Sato-san.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Hiroshima, an­other atomic bomb was dropped on Na­gasaki on Aug 9. More than 75,000 peo­ple were killed in­stantly.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan sur­ren­dered six days later, end­ing World War II.</p>
