    <p>When Pro­fes­sor Utai Uprasen first moved to South Korea from Thai­land a decade ago, he used to get cu­ri­ous ques­tions about his her­itage.</p>
    <p>“When I say I’m from Thai­land, they’d au­to­mat­i­cally think I’m a mi­grant worker in fac­to­ries,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“When I tell them I’m a pro­fes­sor, they’d seem so amazed. Some would ask: ‘Are you re­ally from Thai­land? Aren’t you sup­posed to have tanned skin?’”</p>
    <p>Dr Diane Rozells got the same puz­zled looks when she told South Kore­ans that she is from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“They’d be like, ‘Oh re­ally? But you’re not Chi­nese’,” she said.</p>
    <p>“I’d take the op­por­tu­nity to share with them that Sin­ga­pore is a multiracia­l coun­try with four main races. I’d also ex­plain to them that my an­ces­tors are from both Europe and Asia, mak­ing me Eurasian,” said Dr Rozells, who is of Dutch, Por­tuguese, Ger­man and In­dian de­scent.</p>
    <p>Largely ho­mo­ge­neous, South Korea has long grap­pled with its for­eign pop­u­la­tion, even as the num­ber of such res­i­dents swelled to a high of 2.52 mil­lion last year.</p>
    <p>South-east Asians liv­ing in the coun­try are typ­i­cally viewed as mi­grants by way of mar­riage or lowwage work­ers, and un­der­stand­ably so, with sta­tis­tics show­ing that 89 per cent of those work­ing in South Korea hold visas in the man­u­fac­tur­ing, con­struc­tion, agri­cul­ture, fish­ery and ser­vices sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial data shows there were 647,460 South-east Asians liv­ing in South Korea as at last year, about a third of whom were work­ers. Mi­grants through mar­riage and stu­dents also made up a size­able pro­por­tion of that num­ber.</p>
    <p>But at­ti­tudes to­wards t hem started to change in re­cent years as South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jaein’s New South­ern Pol­icy (NSP) fo­cused on deep­en­ing en­gage­ment with Asean took root and pro­moted greater aware­ness about the im­por­tance of the re­gional bloc since 2017.</p>
    <p>Asean is South Korea’s sec­ond­largest trad­ing part­ner af­ter China, with bi­lat­eral trade reach­ing US$151 bil­lion (S$204.7 bil­lion) last year – a 20-fold in­crease since bi­lat­eral ties were first es­tab­lished 30 years ago. South Korean di­rect in­vest­ment in Asean in­creased to US$9.3 bil­lion last year, up from US$4.3 bil­lion in 2015.</p>
    <p>But the prob­lem with the NSP is that it is “very high level and has not trick­led down to or­di­nary peo­ple yet”, noted Pro­fes­sor Jo­ef­frey Cal­imag from the Philip­pines, who first lived in South Korea as a schol­ar­ship holder in 2002 and is now teach­ing at the Univer­sity of Ul­san.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple like him can help im­prove the sit­u­a­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>Prof Cal­imag is pres­i­dent of the Coun­cil of Asean Pro­fes­sors in Korea (CAPK), an ad­vi­sory com­mit­tee launched in Au­gust last year to pro­mote grass­roots-level ex­changes and part­ner­ship between Asean and South Korean schol­ars, while at the same time help­ing South Kore­ans un­der­stand Asean bet­ter.</p>
    <p>CAPK is an ini­tia­tive of the Asean-Korea Cen­tre (AKC), a Seoul-based in­ter-govern­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tion. The coun­cil com­prises 100 mem­bers from nine Asean states – ex­clud­ing Brunei – out of 603 Asean na­tion­als work­ing in South Korea as pro­fes­sors, for­eign lan­guage in­struc­tors, teach­ing as­sis­tants and re­searchers.</p>
    <p>CAPK pro­fes­sors, whose areas of ex­per­tise range from ed­u­ca­tion and medicine to en­gi­neer­ing and business, gather for con­fer­ences and we­bi­nars, among other things.</p>
    <p>AKC sec­re­tary-gen­eral Lee Hyuk has urged CAPK mem­bers to con­trib­ute more ar­ti­cles to the South Korean me­dia so that readers “will come to re­alise that Asean has quite an im­por­tant pres­ence in academia and in our so­ci­ety”.</p>
    <p>Prof Cal­imag, who teaches internatio­nal business and trade, said he would try to cite more ex­am­ples re­lated to South-east Asia in his class­room so as to pro­mote bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of Asean’s eco­nomic value.</p>
    <p>He said South-east Asians rank in the mid­dle in a hi­er­ar­chy of “pre­ferred for­eign­ers” among South Kore­ans, who typ­i­cally look up to the United States and Europe, and this ap­plied to ed­u­ca­tors too.</p>
    <p>“If you’re white, you’re al­ready 50 per cent in for the job ap­pli­ca­tion, whereas South-east Asians have to prove two to three times more that we are qual­i­fied to teach,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Asean pro­fes­sors rep­re­sent a small com­mu­nity, but it tells Korean peo­ple that we do ex­ist, and that is one way to change their mind­set,” he added.</p>
    <p>Show­cas­ing Asean na­tion­als in a dif­fer­ent light would help counter the stereo­types that some South Kore­ans have of South-east Asia, said Dr Rozells, an as­sis­tant pro­fes­sor at Sook­myung Women’s Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Prof Utai, who teaches at Puky­ong Na­tional Univer­sity, noted that in­ter­est in Asean has in­creased among his South Korean stu­dents, who view the re­gional bloc as a haven for job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“It’s a grow­ing trend among young peo­ple, who talk about Hell Cho­sun a lot,” he said, re­fer­ring to the term of­ten used by South Kore­ans in de­scrib­ing their mod­ern na­tion as a liv­ing hell stuck in the 19th cen­tury.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of that, many of my Korean stu­dents get the idea to go out of Korea to find jobs, and South­east Asia is one of the clos­est places, so they like to know more about South-east Asia.”</p>
    <p>CHANG­ING MIS­CON­CEP­TIONS They’d be like, ‘Oh re­ally? But you’re not Chi­nese.’ I’d take the op­por­tu­nity to share with them that Sin­ga­pore is a multiracia­l coun­try with four main races. DR DIANE ROZELLS, who is of Dutch, Por­tuguese, Ger­man and In­dian de­scent. She says she got puz­zled looks when she told South Kore­ans that she is from Sin­ga­pore.</p>
