    <p>Avid trav­ellers may soon be able to scratch that itch with the planned Sin­ga­pore-Hong Kong travel bub­ble late this month.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Sec­re­tary for Com­merce and Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Ed­ward Yau yes­ter­day ex­pressed op­ti­mism that peo­ple will be able to start fly­ing be­tween the two ci­ties by the end of the month, as both gov­ern­ments fi­nalise de­tails of the travel bub­ble that was an­nounced in mid-Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to re­porters af­ter a TV in­ter­view, Mr Yau said travel agen­cies would likely start sell­ing tick­ets from the mid­dle of this month.</p>
    <p>At least one des­ig­nated flight be­tween the two ci­ties ev­ery day is ex­pected dur­ing the ini­tial phase of the travel bub­ble.</p>
    <p>More flights could be sched­uled if the ar­range­ment proves pop­u­lar, Mr Yau said, adding that there are mea­sures in place to sus­pend the travel bub­ble if the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in ei­ther city wors­ens.</p>
    <p>Separately, Hong Kong of­fi­cials are still in the midst of talks with their Guang­dong coun­ter­parts over a de­layed plan to re­open bor­ders with the main­land.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong had seven new con­firmed cases yes­ter­day, bring­ing its tally to 5,330, in­clud­ing 105 deaths. Of the new cases, six were im­ported and one was lo­cal.</p>
    <p>Health au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day that a woman from China await­ing de­por­ta­tion is among the new cases.</p>
    <p>The 42-year-old was ar­rested last Wed­nes­day for be­ing an al­leged over­stayer. She had spent time in Mong Kok Po­lice Sta­tion and de­ten­tion cen­tres in Cas­tle Peak Bay and Ma Tau Kok, com­ing into con­tact with a dozen de­tainees who slept in the same room.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are try­ing to trace the source of her in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>They are also keep­ing a close watch on a clus­ter of po­ten­tial in­fec­tions, in­clud­ing a woman and a man, both 26, who had stayed at the Seav­iew Hol­i­day Re­sort in Sil­ver­mine Bay with six oth­ers be­tween Oct 25 and 27.</p>
    <p>A 15-year-old boy who came into con­tact with the woman dur­ing a sep­a­rate fam­ily gath­er­ing also tested pos­i­tive in a pre­lim­i­nary test. His school in Fan­ling will be shut for two weeks for dis­in­fec­tion.</p>
