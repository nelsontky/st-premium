    <p>Emer­i­tus Se­nior Min­is­ter Goh Chok Tong will be un­der­go­ing four weeks of ra­dio­ther­apy fol­low­ing the re­moval of a lump in his lar­ynx.</p>
    <p>This is to en­sure that all can­cer­ous cells are killed off.</p>
    <p>“Just like the weather th­ese days, it never rains but pours for me med­i­cally,” the for­mer prime min­is­ter wrote in a Face­book post.</p>
    <p>“What a way to cel­e­brate the fes­tive sea­son!”</p>
    <p>In the post, ESM Goh said the sus­pi­cious lump in his lar­ynx was found to have can­cer­ous squa­mous cells.</p>
    <p>Although scans found no trace of th­ese cells in his neck or chest, he will be un­der­go­ing ra­dio­ther­apy to make sure all can­cer­ous cells are killed off.</p>
    <p>“I share my med­i­cal episodes to en­cour­age ev­ery­one to go for reg­u­lar or an­nual health screen­ings,” said ESM Goh, en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to seek med­i­cal help if they find that their voice has changed and they have a lump in their throat.</p>
    <p>The Health Min­istry has a pro­gramme called Screen For Life, which heav­ily sub­sidises the cost of screen­ing for ail­ments such as cer­vi­cal, breast and col­orec­tal can­cers.</p>
    <p>“Ig­no­rance, de­lay and de­nial may be costly,” wrote ESM Goh.</p>
    <p>“Spot and treat the can­cer early, the five-year sur­vival rate is over 90 per cent. Do it af­ter it has spread, the sur­vival rate drops to be­low 30 per cent.”</p>
    <p>The five-year sur­vival rate refers to the per­cent­age of pa­tients who are alive five years af­ter the can­cer has been found and treated.</p>
    <p>ESM Goh re­ceived many mes­sages from well-wish­ers on his Face­book post, in­clud­ing a note from Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice Tan See Leng en­cour­ag­ing him to take heart.</p>
    <p>“We will all be pray­ing and root­ing for you,” Dr Tan said. “May you have a speedy re­cov­ery.”</p>
    <p>The lump is the lat­est in a string of health scares the 79-year-old el­der states­man has ex­pe­ri­enced in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Last month, he doc­u­mented his surgery to re­move a “big­gish” kid­ney stone and the sub­se­quent re­cov­ery process in sev­eral Face­book posts.</p>
    <p>He had the kid­ney stone laserblast­ed at the Sin­ga­pore Gen­eral Hos­pi­tal, re­turn­ing a week later for a fol­low-up pro­ce­dure to re­move all rem­nants of the stone.</p>
    <p>Apart from some dis­com­fort from hav­ing a catheter and a stent in­serted into his uri­nary tract, the en­tire pro­ce­dure felt like a non­event, he wrote.</p>
    <p>“We have a world-class med­i­cal ser­vice but preven­tion is al­ways bet­ter than cure. To pre­vent stones from form­ing, drink plenty of wa­ter and watch your diet.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, ESM Goh also wrote about how he was saved from an asth­matic at­tack and a near to­tal block­age of two ar­ter­ies in the nick of time.</p>
    <p>“My thun­dery show­ers will pass,” he said in his lat­est post. “I am look­ing for­ward to clear blue sky be­fore the Chi­nese New Year – and more good years there­after.”</p>
