    <p>The Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA), JTC Cor­po­ra­tion and Sin­ga­pore Land Au­thor­ity (SLA) will have new chief ex­ec­u­tives from next month.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent LTA chief Ngien Hoon Ping, who took on the role in Novem­ber 2016, will leave the Ad­min­is­tra­tive Ser­vice to join the FairPrice group.</p>
    <p>Cur­rent JTC chief Ng Lang will re­place him, while SLA chief Tan Boon Khai will take over Mr Ng’s job. Mean­while, cur­rent SLA deputy chief ex­ec­u­tive Si­mon Ong Hung Eng will step up as the act­ing chief ex­ec­u­tive.</p>
    <p>The changes were an­nounced in a joint state­ment by the Min­istry of Trans­port, Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try, and Min­istry of Law (MinLaw) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The Trans­port Min­istry said Mr Ngien had served with dis­tinc­tion and de­vo­tion. Un­der his lead­er­ship, the LTA achieved mile­stones such as the sig­nif­i­cant im­prove­ment in rail re­li­a­bil­ity, with a bench­mark show­ing an al­most ten­fold im­prove­ment.</p>
    <p>He is also cred­ited with lead­ing the de­liv­ery of sev­eral ma­jor in­fras­truc­ture projects such as the Thom­son-East Coast Line, Mandai De­pot and the new Lornie High­way.</p>
    <p>Mr Ngien’s re­place­ment at the LTA, Mr Ng, will step down from JTC af­ter helm­ing it since Septem­ber 2017.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try said Mr Ng had over­seen the de­vel­op­ment of the nextgen­er­a­tion in­dus­trial es­tates in Jurong In­no­va­tion District, Pung­gol Dig­i­tal District and Wood­lands North Coast to help an­chor and trans­form key growth sec­tors.Within JTC, he laid the ground­work to dig­i­talise how it works and trans­acts with cus­tomers. He had also cham­pi­oned sus­tain­abil­ity ef­forts across JTC’s in­dus­trial es­tates.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng’s suc­ces­sor Mr Tan has headed the SLA since May 2015.</p>
    <p>MinLaw said he trans­formed the SLA into a for­ward-look­ing and cus­tomer-cen­tric or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>“Mr Tan pushed ag­gres­sively a broad se­ries of digi­ti­sa­tion and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts to build a more in­te­grated data-driven struc­ture for SLA and its stake­hold­ers, and drive in­no­va­tion through bet­ter use of tech­nol­ogy,” added MinLaw, cit­ing the ex­am­ple of how the SLA suc­cess­fully digi­tised more than one mil­lion pa­per records of Hous­ing Board leases over the past four years.</p>
