    <p>KATH­MANDU/DHAKA • Heavy rain in Nepal trig­gered land­slides yes­ter­day that killed eight labour­ers at a con­struc­tion site and two mem­bers of a fam­ily, tak­ing the toll in floods and land­slides to 177 since late May.</p>
    <p>Else­where in South Asia, the an­nual rainy sea­son brought more mis­ery, with at least 135 peo­ple killed in Bangladesh since late June in the long­est-run­ning floods there in more than two decades.</p>
    <p>Floods have also killed nearly 120 peo­ple and dis­placed mil­lions in the In­dian states of Assam and Bi­har.</p>
    <p>Nepali gov­ern­ment of­fi­cial Mu­rari Wasti told Reuters that the labour­ers were sleep­ing in a tin­roofed shel­ter near the cap­i­tal</p>
    <p>Kath­mandu when the land­slide hit. “Res­cuers dug through the mud and took out all eight bod­ies,” Mr Wasti said.</p>
    <p>One in­jured labourer has been taken to hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>A se­cond land­slide nearby killed a woman and her hus­band.</p>
    <p>Mr Wasti said 57 peo­ple were miss­ing and 111 in­jured in floods or land­slides caused by the May-Septem­ber mon­soon rains.</p>
    <p>Bhutan has also been hit, with four sol­diers killed there last month while res­cu­ing vil­lagers trapped in floods, of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>The flood con­di­tions have com­pli­cated the poor re­gion’s ef­forts to fight the coro­n­avirus outbreak, es­pe­cially in densely pop­u­lated Bangladesh, which has re­ported 240,746 in­fec­tions with 3,154 deaths.</p>
    <p>More than one mil­lion peo­ple are ma­rooned in Bangladesh and thou­sands of hectares of land have been sub­merged, forc­ing over 60,000 to crowd into shel­ters, said Mr Ena­mur Rah­man, a ju­nior min­is­ter in the Dis­as­ter Man­age­ment and Re­lief Min­istry.</p>
    <p>“This is re­ally chal­leng­ing,” he said, adding that ef­forts were be­ing made to main­tain so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>The run-off from heavy rain across the In­dian moun­tains had pushed the lev­els of many of Bangladesh’s rivers into the dan­ger zone, said an ex­pert, con­tribut­ing to the worst flood­ing since 1998.</p>
