    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United States State Depart­ment is ask­ing col­leges and uni­ver­si­ties to di­vest from Chi­nese hold­ings in their en­dow­ments, warn­ing schools in a let­ter on Tues­day to get ahead of po­ten­tially more oner­ous mea­sures on hold­ing the shares.</p>
    <p>“Boards of US uni­ver­sity en­dow­ments would be pru­dent to di­vest from Peo­ple’s Repub­lic of China (PRC) firms’ stocks in the likely out­come that en­hanced list­ing stan­dards l ead to a whole­sale delist­ing of PRC firms from US ex­changes by the end of next year,” Mr Keith Krach, un­der­sec­re­tary for eco­nomic growth, en­ergy and the en­vi­ron­ment, wrote in the let­ter ad­dressed to the board of di­rec­tors of Amer­i­can uni­ver­si­ties and col­leges, and viewed by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>“Hold­ing these stocks also runs the high risks as­so­ci­ated with PRC com­pa­nies hav­ing to re­state fi­nan­cials,” he said.</p>
    <p>The warn­ing to en­dow­ments opens a new front in the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s mul­ti­pronged cam­paign against China’s govern­ment, busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>The col­lege and uni­ver­sity funds rep­re­sent bil­lions of in­vest­ment in Chi­nese com­pa­nies, ac­cord­ing to a 2019 in­ves­ti­ga­tion by Bloomberg, driven by the prospect of bet­ter re­turns.</p>
    <p>China’s For­eign Min­istry yes­ter­day called the US an “im­por­tant” part­ner in in­vest­ment, say­ing both sides had gained from their fi­nan­cial co­op­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“Putting up ob­sta­cles for such co­op­er­a­tion does not serve the in­ter­ests of our cap­i­tal mar­kets,” min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian told a reg­u­lar news brief­ing in Bei­jing, in re­sponse to a ques­tion about the US warn­ing.</p>
    <p>“We urge the US side to cre­ate a fair, just and non-dis­crim­i­na­tory en­vi­ron­ment for Chi­nese com­pa­nies’ in­vest­ment in the US.”</p>
    <p>Ten­sions be­tween the two pow­ers are ris­ing over trade, the Covid-19 pan­demic and a US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion that has fu­elled an es­ca­la­tion of anti-China rhetoric.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s ad­min­is­tra­tion has tight­ened lim­its on Chi­nese uni­ver­sity stu­dents, or­der­ing new re­stric­tions in June that can­celled the US visas of cer­tain grad­u­ate stu­dents and uni­ver­sity re­searchers.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ear­lier this month also went after two of China’s largest tech com­pa­nies, putting out twin ex­ec­u­tive or­ders pro­hibit­ing US per­sons and com­pa­nies from do­ing busi­ness with ByteDance’s TikTok video app and Ten­cent Hold­ings’ WeChat mes­sag­ing ser­vice.</p>
    <p>En­dow­ments will be ea­ger to ex­am­ine the is­sues the govern­ment is rais­ing, Mr Krach said on Tues­day in a Bloomberg Ra­dio interview.</p>
    <p>“These boards have a moral re­spon­si­bil­ity, and per­haps a fidu­ciary duty, to re­ally look into this, to make sure their in­vest­ments are clean,” said Mr Krach, for­mer chair­man of the Pur­due Uni­ver­sity Board of Trus­tees.</p>
    <p>Tues­day’s warn­ing is part of a larger cam­paign by US of­fi­cials to slow the money that has flowed from in­vest­ment funds into Chi­nese com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Sec­re­tary of State Michael Pom­peo told state gov­er­nors in Fe­bru­ary that some pen­sion funds are play­ing into China’s hands.</p>
    <p>The flow of US pen­sion and en­dow­ment cash into Chi­nese eq­ui­ties has boosted the suc­cess of global gi­ants such as on­line re­tailer Alibaba Group Hold­ing, as well as ris­ing stars like ar­ti­fi­cial-in­tel­li­gence com­pany SenseTime Group, which is now on a list of tech com­pa­nies banned from do­ing busi­ness in the US.</p>
    <p>For­eign eq­ui­ties made up 13.9 per cent of col­lege en­dow­ments with more than US$1 bil­lion (S$1.36 bil­lion), ac­cord­ing to the most re­cent data com­piled by the Na­tional As­so­ci­a­tion of Col­lege and Uni­ver­sity Busi­ness Of­fi­cers for the year ended June 2019.</p>
    <p>The State Depart­ment let­ter also warns uni­ver­si­ties of China’s grow­ing in­flu­ence on cam­puses and said the US is ac­cel­er­at­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions of what it called “il­licit PRC fund­ing of re­search, in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty theft and the re­cruit­ment of tal­ent”.</p>
