    <p>Cli­mate change is a uni­ver­sal prob­lem, and its scale and im­pact are un­prece­dented. As hu­mans are re­spon­si­ble for the chang­ing cli­mate and its ef­fects, we must en­sure that our ac­tions do not cause fur­ther dam­age to our en­vi­ron­ment. The clock is tick­ing – the time to act is now.</p>
    <p>In my city of Jakarta, we are learn­ing the lessons of cli­mate change the hard way. Ex­treme weather and flood­ing have been peren­nial prob­lems for Jakarta, and over the years, they have be­come more fre­quent and se­vere.</p>
    <p>The longer-than-usual dry sea­son (musim ke­ma­rau) de­grades the air qual­ity, and changes in weather pat­terns threaten our food sup­ply and ex­ac­er­bate sea-level rise and flood­ing.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate change also poses so­cio-eco­nomic risks such as dis­rup­tions to our chil­dren’s school ac­tiv­i­ties due to floods. Such ef­fects are not eas­ily mea­sured, but they are crit­i­cal to the long-term de­vel­op­ment and well-be­ing of our peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Jakarta is one of the largest cities in South-east Asia, with 10 mil­lion to 14 mil­lion res­i­dents com­mut­ing on a typ­i­cal work day. As the cap­i­tal of In­done­sia and the largest eco­nomic con­trib­u­tor to the na­tion, it ac­counted for 17 per cent of na­tional gross do­mes­tic prod­uct last year.</p>
    <p>This places great ex­pec­ta­tions on Jakarta, as other cities in In­done­sia and the wider re­gion look to it as a cen­tre of eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity and lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>JAKARTA RE­GEN­ER­A­TION PLAN</p>
    <p>To tackle the un­prece­dented cli­mate cri­sis, the Jakarta gov­ern­ment has in­tro­duced the Jakarta Re­gen­er­a­tion Plan, a se­ries of col­lab­o­ra­tive cli­mate ac­tion strate­gies that build on the col­lec­tive ef­forts of gov­ern­ment, busi­nesses, non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions and the com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>The plan seeks to transform our in­fra­struc­ture and ur­ban spa­tial poli­cies to en­sure sus­tain­able com­mu­nity de­vel­op­ment, with a fo­cus on the trans­port sec­tor, which con­trib­utes more than half of Jakarta’s cli­mate-dam­ag­ing emis­sions.</p>
    <p>First, the plan aims to re­duce pri­vate ve­hi­cle use by tran­si­tion­ing from pri­vate ve­hi­cle-ori­ented de­vel­op­ment to tran­sit-ori­ented de­vel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes work­ing with bus and rail op­er­a­tors to ex­pand and in­te­grate all pub­lic trans­port modes into the one-fare Jak Lingko sys­tem.</p>
    <p>To date, pub­lic mini­vans, minibuses and mi­crobuses, which serve up to one mil­lion pas­sen­gers daily, have joined the in­te­grated sys­tem. The pub­lic trans­port fleet and pas­sen­gers have dou­bled since 2017, and the pub­lic tran­sit cov­er­age has risen to around</p>
    <p>80 per cent of the Jakarta area.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, we aim to re­duce com­mut­ing time by pro­vid­ing more af­ford­able high-rise hous­ing near the city cen­tre. Through the Zero Down Pay­ment (DP 0) scheme, we are pro­vid­ing in­cen­tives to pri­vate devel­op­ers to build af­ford­able high-rise hous­ing in the city cen­tre.</p>
    <p>This will po­ten­tially shift the res­i­den­tial pop­u­la­tion from the city pe­riph­ery closer to the city cen­tre or to a pub­lic trans­port node, thus fur­ther re­duc­ing travel time and de­pen­dency on pri­vate ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>The third strat­egy is to ad­dress un­der-in­vest­ment in ba­sic ser­vices such as ac­cess to clean water and waste man­age­ment fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>To re­duce our de­pen­dency on the mas­sive Ban­tar Ge­bang land­fill site in Bekasi district, we aim to re­duce waste pro­duc­tion by 30 per cent and in­crease waste treat­ment by 70 per cent by 2025.</p>
    <p>Through the Sam­tama Move­ment (Joint Waste Re­spon­si­bil­ity), we are work­ing with gov­ern­ment, busi­nesses, the com­mu­nity and other stake­hold­ers to raise aware­ness of the con­cept of</p>
    <p>“re­duce, re­use, re­cy­cle” in man­ag­ing our waste.</p>
    <p>The Jakarta Re­gen­er­a­tion Plan also in­cludes kam­pung de­vel­op­ment. We have in­tro­duced the con­cept of Com­mu­nity Ac­tion Plan­ning, fo­cus­ing on how com­mu­nal plan­ning and ex­e­cu­tion can pre­pare res­i­dents for cli­mate change mit­i­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>In South Jakarta’s Cipete Se­la­tan vil­lage, for ex­am­ple, res­i­dents have been work­ing to­gether since 2012 to build 17 in­fil­tra­tion points along 50m of the road or in the hous­ing es­tate. This helped to al­le­vi­ate flood­ing this year, when ar­eas with in­fil­tra­tion wells were spared the wide­spread flood­ing that af­flicted sur­round­ing ar­eas.</p>
    <p>THE WAY FOR­WARD</p>
    <p>To date, Jakarta’s ini­tia­tives for en­vi­ron­men­tal im­prove­ment have pro­duced some pos­i­tive re­sults.</p>
    <p>Our air qual­ity has shown a no­tice­able de­crease in PM2.5 con­cen­tra­tion lev­els, with a re­duc­tion of 21.9 per cent since 2017. This achieve­ment was proudly cel­e­brated by Jakarta res­i­dents through the pop­u­lar #Jakar­taLan­gitBiru so­cial me­dia posts. The city’s ef­forts have also been wel­comed by the cen­tral gov­ern­ment of In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>The suc­cess of this plan is cer­tainly not through the sole ef­forts of the Jakarta gov­ern­ment. Over the past two years, the gov­ern­ment of the city has co­or­di­nated and col­lab­o­rated with the cen­tral gov­ern­ment, aca­demics and en­vi­ron­men­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions such as C40 Cities, WRI In­done­sia, In­sti­tute for Trans­porta­tion and De­vel­op­ment Pol­icy, Vi­tal Strate­gies and ICLEI – Lo­cal Gov­ern­ments for Sus­tain­abil­ity, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>But the work is far from fin­ished – much re­mains to be done, and our ef­forts must con­tinue. Jakarta has com­mit­ted to the Paris Agree­ment to keep global tem­per­a­ture rise be­low 2 deg C above pre-in­dus­trial lev­els. It will take a pool­ing of re­sources and con­sid­er­able, con­certed and con­tin­u­ous ef­forts to re­alise the Paris Agree­ment goals and be­yond.</p>
    <p>Cli­mate change is a global ex­is­ten­tial chal­lenge that af­fects ev­ery city, large or small, and col­lab­o­ra­tion with many par­ties is needed to solve the chal­lenges we face. More than ever be­fore, Jakarta and other cities across the globe must work to­gether to face this ur­gent threat and build a live­able, sus­tain­able and healthy en­vi­ron­ment for all. Let us join hands to achieve our am­bi­tious car­bon emis­sion tar­gets and erad­i­cate this global chal­lenge to­gether.</p>
