    <p>For peo­ple who have al­ways wanted to train like a Marvel su­per­hero, there is now a place for that.</p>
    <p>At the new Home Team NS Club­house in Khatib, one can work out like Cap­tain Amer­ica and Iron Man in a four-storey com­plex that has a mid-air ob­sta­cle course, rap­pelling and speed-climb­ing sta­tions, and ninja-war­rior-style cir­cuit train­ing.</p>
    <p>The 21,000 sq m club­house also boasts a 14m in­door slide, one of the long­est in Sin­ga­pore, and a fully equip­ped gym with a 300-per­son ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The club­house is home to Ad­ven­ture HQ, an in­door hub com­plete with mid-air ae­rial in­stal­la­tions such as a roll glider, rock climb­ing walls, sen­sory ad­ven­ture trails and rope cour­ses.</p>
    <p>Also in the works is Tac­tSim, a player-ver­sus-player air­soft arena de­signed as a tac­ti­cal sim­u­la­tor.</p>
    <p>This is to help Home Team op­er­a­tionally ready na­tional ser­vice­men im­prove their marks­man­ship, as well as de­ci­sion-mak­ing and lead­er­ship skills in an ur­ban en­vi­ron­ment through game­play.</p>
    <p>The Khatib club­house is the fifth Home Team NS club­house to open in Sin­ga­pore. There are four other lo­ca­tions in Balestier, Bukit Ba­tok, Chi­na­town and Tampines. Two other club­houses in Be­dok and Ten­gah are set to open from 2022.</p>
    <p>“The open­ing of the Home Team NS Khatib Club­house is very timely, given that we are also cel­e­brat­ing our 15th an­niver­sary this year,” said Min­is­ter of State for Home Af­fairs and Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Muham­mad</p>
    <p>Ibrahim.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Faishal, who is also pres­i­dent of Home Team NS, added that it has “come a long way” since its in­cep­tion in 2005.</p>
    <p>Home Team NS chief ex­ec­u­tive Agnes Eu said the club was de­signed and pur­pose-built for en­vi­ron­men­tal sus­tain­abil­ity, to cater to the needs of cur­rent and fu­ture gen­er­a­tions of the Home Team NS com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the club­house comes with en­ergy-ef­ficient features, such as charg­ing sta­tions for elec­tric cars and smart light­ing con­trols. About 1,370 sq m of so­lar pho­to­voltaic pan­els are housed on the</p>
    <p>Faishal rooftop, while a rain­wa­ter-har­vest­ing sys­tem will help sig­nif­i­cantly with wa­ter conservati­on.</p>
    <p>An Olympic-size swim­ming pool is also out­fit­ted with a fil­tra­tion sys­tem that sani­tises the wa­ter with­out the need for chem­i­cals like chlo­rine, while re­duc­ing the wa­ter re­quired for clean­ing by around 30 per cent.</p>
    <p>“By in­tro­duc­ing unique ex­pe­ri­ences sup­ported by eco-conscious tech­nol­ogy, we aim to in­spire new bench­marks for how club­houses op­er­ate in terms of de­sign, fa­cil­i­ties and of­fer­ings,” Ms Eu said.</p>
    <p>Other fa­cil­i­ties in­clude a ball­room that can hold 600 guests and a Per­anakan-themed in­door play­ground for chil­dren un­der 12, com­plete with a ball pit and climb­ing slide tun­nels.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures such as ca­pac­ity lim­its, as well as steppedup hy­giene practices, will be in place at the Home Team NS Khatib Club­house un­til fur­ther no­tice.</p>
    <p>Home Team NS mem­bers can down­load the Home Team NS mo­bile app to check crowd lev­els and make book­ings ac­cord­ingly.</p>
    <p>Club­house fa­cil­i­ties are also open to mem­bers of the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Rates and open­ing hours can be found on www.home­teamns.sg/khatib/</p>
