    <p>LON­DON • Manch­ester United are clos­ing in on the sign­ing of Donny van de Beek from Ajax Am­s­ter­dam af­ter the English Premier League club agreed a £ 4 0 mi l l i o n (S$72.6 mil­lion) deal for the Nether­lands mid­fielder.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to multiple me­dia re­ports, in­clud­ing Dutch news­pa­per De Tele­graaf, per­sonal terms have been agreed and he is set to sign a five- year deal later this week.</p>
    <p>Ajax coach Erik ten Hag all but con­firmed the 23-year-old’s de­par­ture, con­firm­ing to lo­cal TV chan­nel Ziggo Sport that de Beek was left out of the Ere­di­visie club’s friendly with Ein­tra­cht Frank­furt on Satur­day be­cause of United’s bid.</p>
    <p>“There have been some de­vel­op­ments that made us de­cide to keep him out of the squad,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We will see what hap­pens. We’ll make an an­nounce­ment as soon as there’s some clar­ity.”</p>
    <p>Van de Beek will rep­re­sent the Red Dev­ils’ first buy of the trans­fer win­dow and will be a wel­come sight for United fans af­ter in­ter­est in Borus­sia Dort­mund for­ward</p>
    <p>Jadon San­cho cooled fol­low­ing the Bun­desliga club’s re­fusal to budge from their £108 mil­lion val­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing scored 40 goals in all com­pe­ti­tions since his 2015 de­but, the Ajax academy grad­u­ate is known as a box-to-box mid­fielder, but he can also give Ole Gun­nar Sol­sk­jaer op­tions with his abil­ity to sit deep.</p>
    <p>Last sea­son, he made two tack­les per game in the Dutch league – the fourth-high­est in the team de­spite play­ing a more ad­vanced role – and the United man­ager is a known ad­mirer of his ver­sa­til­ity.</p>
    <p>The exit of van de Beek, who was heav­ily linked with a move to La Liga cham­pi­ons Real Madrid in the</p>
    <p>Jan­uary trans­fer win­dow, will rep­re­sent the fi­nal break-up of the Ajax side that reached the Cham­pi­ons League semi-fi­nals last year.</p>
    <p>Frenkie de Jong and Matthijs de Ligt, their two best-known youthteam prod­ucts, left last sum­mer in big-money moves to Barcelona and Ju­ven­tus re­spec­tively, while Hakim Ziyech com­pleted his €45 mil­lion (S$73.1 mil­lion) trans­fer to Chelsea in July.</p>
    <p>Van de Beek will not be the only big-name player mov­ing to the English top flight in the com­ing days af­ter The Guardian yes­ter­day said an ini­tial £72 mil­lion deal had been agreed be­tween Chelsea and Bun­desliga out­fit Bayer Lev­erkusen for Ger­many mid­fielder Kai Havertz.</p>
    <p>The trans­fer, which ex­cludes £18 mil­lion in add-ons, will make the 21-year-old the club’s most ex­pen­sive player ever and make him the Blues’ sixth new face this sum­mer, tak­ing their win­dow spend­ing past the £200 mil­lion mark.</p>
    <p>Lev­erkusen man­ager Peter Bosz prac­ti­cally con­firmed his exit yes­ter­day, say­ing: “I don’t ex­pect Kai Havertz to train with us again.”</p>
