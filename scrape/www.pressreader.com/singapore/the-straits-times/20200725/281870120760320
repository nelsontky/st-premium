    <p>China yes­ter­day or­dered the clo­sure of the United States con­sulate in Chengdu in re­tal­i­a­tion for the abrupt shut­ting of the Chi­nese con­sulate in Hous­ton, Texas.</p>
    <p>The move is a “le­git­i­mate and nec­es­sary re­sponse” to “un­rea­son­able” US ac­tions, said a state­ment from China’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs, squarely blam­ing the Amer­i­cans for the cur­rent state of diplo­matic ties.</p>
    <p>“China has de­cided to re­voke the li­cence for the es­tab­lish­ment and op­er­a­tion of the US Con­sulate Gen­eral in Chengdu and put for­ward spe­cific re­quire­ments for the Con­sulate Gen­eral to stop all busi­ness and ac­tiv­i­ties,” the state­ment said.</p>
    <p>US diplo­mats have un­til Mon­day morn­ing to leave the mis­sion in Chengdu, Sichuan prov­ince. Since the an­nounce­ment, state broad­caster CCTV has set up a live stream from out­side the con­sulate, draw­ing nearly 30 mil­lion view­ers de­spite the lack of ac­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing said the Chengdu con­sulate was cho­sen be­cause some con­sular staff had been en­gag­ing in ac­tiv­ity that “did not match their iden­ti­ties, in­ter­fered in China’s in­ter­nal af­fairs and harmed China’s se­cu­rity in­ter­ests”.</p>
    <p>“The Chi­nese side has made rep­re­sen­ta­tions on this many times, and the US side is well aware of this,” said For­eign Min­istry spokesman Wang Wen­bin in a reg­u­lar press brief­ing yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the US Em­bassy web­site, the Chengdu con­sulate over­sees the western Chi­nese prov­inces of Yun­nan, Sichuan and Guizhou, as well as Chongqing mu­nic­i­pal­ity and Ti­bet.</p>
    <p>In main­land China, the US also has diplo­matic mis­sions in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang and Wuhan, be­sides the em­bassy in Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Es­tab­lished in 1985, the Chengdu con­sulate has been mired in con­tro­versy be­fore. In 2013, China de­manded an ex­pla­na­tion from the US af­ter news re­ports said a top-se­cret map leaked by fugi­tive in­tel­li­gence an­a­lyst Edward Snow­den showed sur­veil­lance fa­cil­i­ties at Amer­i­can em­bassies and con­sulates world­wide – with the Chengdu con­sulate among them.</p>
    <p>A year ear­lier, in 2012, se­nior se­cu­rity of­fi­cial Wang Li­jun made a dash to the con­sulate while flee­ing from his pow­er­ful boss Bo Xi­lai, then party chief of nearby Chongqing.</p>
    <p>Ties be­tween China and the US are at their worst in years, with the world’s two largest economies at odds over a range of is­sues in­clud­ing trade, es­pi­onage and Bei­jing’s han­dling of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, in or­der­ing the clo­sure of China’s con­sulate in Hous­ton on Tues­day, cited the need to pro­tect Amer­i­can in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty and in­tel­li­gence. It de­scribed the mis­sion as the “epi­cen­tre” of China’s mil­i­tary-backed in­dus­trial es­pi­onage.</p>
    <p>Shortly af­ter the or­dered clo­sure, wit­nesses in Hous­ton saw doc­u­ments be­ing burnt in open bins in the con­sulate com­pound.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese diplo­mats were given 72 hours – un­til yes­ter­day af­ter­noon US time – to va­cate the premises.</p>
    <p>As the dead­line loomed, Chi­nese Con­sul Gen­eral Cai Wei vowed to keep the con­sulate open de­spite US de­mands. “We are still op­er­at­ing nor­mally, so we will see what will hap­pen (on Fri­day),” he told Amer­i­can news web­site Politico in an in­ter­view, but de­clined to elab­o­rate.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing’s re­tal­ia­tory an­nounce­ment came just hours af­ter US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo called on Chi­nese peo­ple and “free na­tions of the world” to change the be­hav­iour of the Chi­nese Com­mu­nist Party, in a ma­jor pol­icy speech.</p>
    <p>It caps a se­ries of speeches in re­cent weeks from se­nior US of­fi­cials high­light­ing what they said was the im­bal­anced na­ture of the re­la­tion­ship be­tween the world’s two largest economies.</p>
    <p>Bei­jing has hit back at Mr Pom­peo, say­ing his speech was filled with ide­o­log­i­cal bias, and also called on the US to dis­card its “Cold War men­tal­ity”.</p>
