    <p>Home-grown tai­lor and cos­tume de­signer Azni Samdin was do­ing what he does best when he was an­nounced as the win­ner of the Best Makeup & Cos­tume De­sign Award at the Golden Horse Awards last Saturday night – sew­ing at his stu­dio in Ali­wal Street.</p>
    <p>The 50-year-old, who won for his work on lo­cal drag mu­si­cal com­edy film Num­ber 1, found out the news from a stranger who mes­saged him on so­cial me­dia with the sim­ple words: “You won.”</p>
    <p>Azni re­counts the happy mo­ment in a tele­phone in­ter­view with The Straits Times: “I was go­ing to stream the cer­e­mony live, but the Wi-Fi in my stu­dio was a bit spotty, so I thought, ‘Okay lah, never mind.’</p>
    <p>“Then at around 7pm, I got a mes­sage from a com­plete stranger who told me I had won. And I was like, ‘I won?’</p>
    <p>“A while later, my phone started buzzing non-stop with mes­sages from friends and the cast.” He adds: “I was so shocked and happy, I couldn’t sew any­more, so I went out to have a lit­tle cel­e­bra­tory din­ner.”</p>
    <p>He shares the accolade with Malaysian stylist Ray­mond Kuek, who did the hair and make-up de­sign. Kuek col­lected the award on­stage in Taipei with di­rec­tor Ong Kuo Sin.</p>
    <p>Num­ber 1, now show­ing in cin­e­mas, was also nom­i­nated for Best Lead­ing Ac­tor for Mark Lee, who did not win.</p>
    <p>Azni, who stud­ied graphic de­sign at Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa) and learnt how to sew at Bunka Fash­ion School, founded his own bri­dal wear stu­dio in 2015.</p>
    <p>But his his­tory with the lo­cal en­ter­tain­ment scene goes way back.</p>
    <p>In the 1990s, he was a tele­vi­sion pro­ducer and later joined tal­ent agency Mu­sic & Move­ment, help­ing to style and de­sign con­cert cos­tumes for pop stars like Tanya Chua and Sandy Lam.</p>
    <p>He has also been do­ing free­lance styling for pro­grammes on lo­cal tele­vi­sion chan­nels like Suria.</p>
    <p>Even so, he never con­sid­ered the</p>
    <p>Golden Horse Awards – the Os­cars of Chi­nese-lan­guage cin­ema – to be within reach.</p>
    <p>“When I heard I was nom­i­nated, I felt like I was float­ing. I still feel like that be­cause from a young age, I’ve known the Golden Horse Awards and the peo­ple who ap­pear at the cer­e­mony are like my ‘ou xiang’ (idol in Man­darin),” says the long-time fan of Can­topop and Man­dopop stars such as Lam.</p>
    <p>A lot of hard work went into Num­ber 1. Azni de­signed more than 35 pieces for the movie, which has var­i­ous song-and-dance drag queen per­for­mances. While he has a team of tai­lors, he per­son­ally put the fin­ish­ing touches on the cos­tumes.</p>
    <p>“Things like the head­pieces, ear­rings – a lot of it was hand­made. A lot of the ac­tors in the cast don’t have ear­ring holes, so I had to make clip-on ear­rings for them,” he says.</p>
    <p>It was not his first ex­pe­ri­ence with drag cos­tume de­sign.</p>
    <p>While study­ing at Nafa, he worked as an as­sis­tant stylist in the now-de­funct cabaret club Boom Boom Room, where lo­cal drag</p>
    <p>queen Ku­mar got his start.</p>
    <p>Azni says of de­sign­ing drag cos­tumes: “We have to un­der­stand what the per­for­mance is about, when the cos­tume will be used, and also whether the wearer feels com­fort­able. Be­cause with the in­ner pieces, like the bras with sponges, the stock­ings, the heavy wigs and thick make-up – we want to make sure the wearer isn’t bogged down by the clothes and it’s still easy to move around and dance.”</p>
    <p>Given the quar­an­tine re­quire­ments for trav­el­ling to Taipei and back, Azni, who is di­vorced with a son, chose not to at­tend the Golden Horse Awards cer­e­mony.</p>
    <p>But he has imag­ined what it would have been like at the event.</p>
    <p>He says: “I think I would have cried. Even just watch­ing a clip of the team col­lect­ing the award, with the cam­era pan­ning to Mark, his wife and the cast tear­ing up, I teared up too.”</p>
