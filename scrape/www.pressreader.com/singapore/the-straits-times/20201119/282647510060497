    <p>More than 30 art gal­leries in Sin­ga­pore will take part in a three-day open house event start­ing to­mor­row, with ex­hi­bi­tions, guided tours and work­shops.</p>
    <p>The in­au­gu­ral Sin­ga­pore Gallery Week­end, or­gan­ised by the Art Gal­leries As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore (Agas), fea­tures on-site and on­line events such as shows at Gill­man Bar­racks and other parts of the is­land, pa­per-mak­ing ac­tiv­i­ties at STPI – Creative Work­shop & Gallery in Robert­son Quay, and the Af­ford­able On­line Art Fair.</p>
    <p>Agas’ vice-pres­i­dent Rita Tar­gui, the di­rec­tor of STPI Gallery, says Covid-19 was “in­stru­men­tal” in bring­ing gal­leries closer. While the idea of a gallery week­end had been float­ing around for sev­eral years, they only de­cided to act on it now.</p>
    <p>“For once in our lives, we are not run­ning all over the globe par­tic­i­pat­ing in art fairs,” she says. “(The pan­demic) has helped us get much closer, more strate­gic, get dis­cus­sions on the ta­ble and set a new di­rec­tion for Agas. Bangkok has done (a gallery week­end), Malaysia has done it, so why can’t we?”</p>
    <p>The gallery week­end is spear­headed by Agas’ new ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee, which re­cently mod­i­fied the as­so­ci­a­tion’s con­sti­tu­tion to make it more in­clu­sive.</p>
    <p>In the past two months, mem­ber­ship has gone up by 50 per cent. It now comes in three tiers – a core tier for groups that deal with the sale of art, in­clud­ing on­line gal­leries; an af­fil­i­ate tier for pro­fes­sion­als such as con­ser­va­tors, art han­dlers and con­sul­tants; and a roundtable tier where state agen­cies and in­sti­tu­tions are in­vited to share their ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>Agas pres­i­dent Khairud­din Hori, who is also the di­rec­tor and part­ner at Chan + Hori Con­tem­po­rary, adds that new gal­leries can now join im­me­di­ately as af­fil­i­ate mem­bers. “Be­fore this, you would need to be a work­ing gallery for a min­i­mum of three years be­fore you could be con­sid­ered a mem­ber.”</p>
    <p>Asked if they had mod­elled the event on those in other coun­tries, he says Gallery Week­end Ber­lin was a source of in­spi­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Khairud­din re­calls one pre­sen­ta­tion by artists at that event who had funded their pro­gramme by sell­ing prints of their own works.</p>
    <p>“It would be great if in fu­ture the SG Gallery Week­end could be as or­ganic and ground-up as this – to be as in­de­pen­dent as pos­si­ble and not rely too much on grants. To not to have that crutch men­tal­ity. There’s crit­i­cism that the arts scene is over­sup­ported, that is why it is fall­ing onto it­self.”</p>
    <p>Other gallery week­end high­lights in­clude the Young Tal­ent Pro­gramme Win­ners’ Solo Ex­hi­bi­tions at Ion Art Gallery, an art pod­cast hosted by Chan + Hori Con­tem­po­rary and week­end res­i­dency stu­dio vis­its at Cu­turi Gallery in Kam­pong Glam.</p>
    <p>Asked about col­lec­tors’ be­hav­iour amid the pan­demic, Mr Khairud­din says they tend to ask for more dis­counts, and are also trad­ing works or sell­ing them to one an­other. He notes that Chan + Hori, which now has a pop-up space rather than a per­ma­nent gallery, has also reached out to new clients, in­clud­ing over­seas ones.</p>
    <p>Gal­lerist Au­drey Yeo of Yeo Work­shop, chair of the as­so­ci­a­tion’s plan­ning and de­vel­op­ment com­mit­tee, says there are peo­ple – such as those who in­vested in tech stocks – who have still been able to buy art. “Of course we’ve been try­ing to be very sen­si­tive – you don’t know, in this pan­demic sit­u­a­tion, who has lost and who has gained,” she adds.</p>
    <p>Ms Tar­gui says STPI has had deeper con­ver­sa­tions with its clients. She adds: “It’s not just the lower-priced works that are go­ing, but works that col­lec­tors have been study­ing, that they are fa­mil­iar with. These works sell, even if it is an on­line pre­sen­ta­tion.”</p>
