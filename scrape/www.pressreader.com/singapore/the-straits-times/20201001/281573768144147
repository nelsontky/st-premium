    <p>How has Is­rael, a coun­try of just</p>
    <p>8.6 mil­lion, man­aged to pro­duce and in­spire so many in­ter­na­tion­ally pop­u­lar tele­vi­sion shows – es­pe­cially on Amer­i­can TV, where it is one of the top providers of con­tent? Screen­writer Moshe Zon­der tells The Straits Times that this is a re­sult of the coun­try’s dra­matic his­tory and hav­ing to work with lim­ited pro­duc­tion bud­gets.</p>
    <p>How has Is­rael, a coun­try of just 8.6 mil­lion, man­aged to pro­duce and in­spire so many in­ter­na­tion­ally pop­u­lar tele­vi­sion shows – es­pe­cially on Amer­i­can TV, where it is one of the top providers of con­tent?</p>
    <p>This in­cludes the award-win­ning Hol­ly­wood dra­mas Home­land (2011 to 2020) and Eu­pho­ria (2019 to now), both adapted from Is­raeli se­ries. The lat­ter saw its star, Zendaya, take home the award for Out­stand­ing Lead Ac­tress In A Drama Se­ries at last week’s Em­mys.</p>
    <p>Moshe Zon­der, who wrote the ac­claimed Is­raeli spy thriller Fauda (2015 to now) – an in­ter­na­tional hit since be­ing picked up by Net­flix – thinks the coun­try’s suc­cess stems from its dra­matic his­tory and, para­dox­i­cally, the lim­ited TV bud­gets it works with.</p>
    <p>Zon­der spoke to The Straits Times and other press re­cently about his lat­est es­pi­onage drama, Tehran.</p>
    <p>Now stream­ing on Ap­ple TV+, the nail-bit­ing se­ries fol­lows an Is­raeli agent trapped in Iran – one of the world’s most dan­ger­ous places for Is­raelis, who are banned from trav­el­ling there be­cause of the en­mity be­tween the two na­tions.</p>
    <p>Zon­der, 54, was the head writer on Fauda, which has been widely praised for its de­pic­tion of an un­der­cover unit in Is­rael’s armed forces.</p>
    <p>Like Fauda, Tehran of­fers a more sym­pa­thetic and nu­anced per­spec­tive on char­ac­ters that Is­raeli film and TV would once have por­trayed as two-di­men­sional vil­lains, he says.</p>
    <p>Zon­der ar­rived at this per­spec­tive be­cause of his pre­vi­ous ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“For many years, in par­al­lel to be­ing a screen­writer, I was an in­ves­tiga­tive jour­nal­ist and I was able to go to the West Bank and the Gaza</p>
    <p>Strip and meet char­ac­ters like the head of the mil­i­tary regime of the Ha­mas move­ment. And I was able to in­ter­view him, hear him talk about his fam­ily and un­der­stand his point of view.”</p>
    <p>This is why the an­tag­o­nists on Fauda and Tehran are mul­ti­di­men­sional.</p>
    <p>“In Is­raeli so­ci­ety, Abu Ah­mad – the an­tag­o­nist in Fauda – would never have been (seen as) a hu­man be­ing. As a char­ac­ter, the only ques­tion about some­one like him would have been whether we man­aged to kill him or not,” Zon­der ex­plains.</p>
    <p>“But I wrote him as some­one who has a wife and chil­dren he loves, and a mo­tive that an Is­raeli au­di­ence could un­der­stand. It would’ve been like sci­ence fic­tion to show this kind of char­ac­ter on Is­raeli prime time TV only five years ago.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the hos­til­ity many Is­raelis might feel to­wards Iran, in creat­ing the new se­ries Tehran, Zon­der adopted the same ap­proach to re­flect the re­al­ity that “peo­ple are com­pli­cated” and “ev­ery tribe is telling its story”.</p>
    <p>“I have al­ways wanted to cross bor­ders – phys­i­cally and men­tally. So Tehran has the same DNA as Fauda: there are no good guys or bad guys. I think it’s also good writ­ing not to use th­ese stereo­types,” he adds.</p>
    <p>He also wanted to chal­lenge view­ers’ ex­pec­ta­tions for the char­ac­ter Faraz Ka­mali (played by Home­land’s Shaun Toub) – an of­fi­cial from Iran’s Revo­lu­tion­ary Guard try­ing to hunt down Is­raeli hacker Ta­mar (Niv Sul­tan),</p>
    <p>“You’re sure he’s the vil­lain at the be­gin­ning, but later in the show you ac­tu­ally fall in love with him, be­cause he is a fam­ily man, a man of hon­our and a true pa­triot.”</p>
    <p>To write this and other se­ries, Zon­der taps his ex­pe­ri­ence as an in­ves­tiga­tive re­porter. “It helps me ev­ery minute while we are do­ing re­search and in­ter­view­ing peo­ple in or­der to get the in­for­ma­tion we need.</p>
    <p>“And while be­ing a jour­nal­ist, I wrote a lot about de­fence and in­tel­li­gence mat­ters and I know quite a lot about the Mos­sad and how the Is­raeli in­tel­li­gence com­mu­nity works.”</p>
    <p>Asked why Is­rael is able to pro­duce so many hit se­ries de­spite its small size, Zon­der and Tehran cocre­ator Dana Eden point to the coun­try’s tur­bu­lent past.</p>
    <p>Says Eden: “Be­cause we live in a coun­try full of con­flicts and re­ally in­ter­est­ing, amaz­ing sto­ries, we know how to tell those sto­ries and make them en­ter­tain­ing.</p>
    <p>“Shows like Fauda and Tehran take huge con­flicts that could be very dark, but present them in a way ev­ery­body can re­late to, and in a hu­man way.”</p>
    <p>Zon­der be­lieves hav­ing lim­ited re­sources for TV pro­duc­tions com­pels Is­raeli crews to get creative.</p>
    <p>“Our bud­gets in Is­raeli TV shows are very low, es­pe­cially com­pared with the United States and Europe.</p>
    <p>“This has forced us, in a good way, to deal with the char­ac­ters and their in­ner world be­cause we don’t have the abil­ity to do spec­tac­u­lar things on screen. And this is ac­tu­ally the core of a good show.”</p>
    <p>I have al­ways wanted to cross bor­ders – phys­i­cally and men­tally. So Tehran has the same DNA as Fauda: there are no good guys or bad guys. I think it’s also good writ­ing not to use th­ese stereo­types.</p>
