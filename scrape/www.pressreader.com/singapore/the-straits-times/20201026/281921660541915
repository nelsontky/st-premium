    <p>Hate has en­joyed a free­wheel­ing ride on In­dian tele­vi­sion news pro­grammes in re­cent years. Com­mu­nal pas­sions were in­cited, mi­nori­ties tar­geted and hate speech pro­lif­er­ated.</p>
    <p>Even self-reg­u­la­tion by the me­dia in­dus­try has failed to stem this wor­ry­ing tide, prompt­ing many cam­paign­ers to name and shame brands that ad­ver­tise on chan­nels ped­dling hate. But the cam­paign has met with lit­tle suc­cess, un­til now.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral lead­ing In­dian brands, in­clud­ing Ba­jaj Auto and Parle Prod­ucts, have made public their dis­plea­sure over the state of In­dian TV jour­nal­ism in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>Mr Ra­jiv Ba­jaj, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of Ba­jaj Auto, told CNBC TV18 on Oct 8 that his firm has de­cided not to ad­ver­tise on three un­named chan­nels be­cause the firm does not en­dorse tox­i­c­ity and hate-mon­ger­ing.</p>
    <p>“To me it is a wise de­ci­sion be­cause my child, my brother’s chil­dren can’t in­herit an In­dia and a so­ci­ety where such hate fes­ters,” Mr Ba­jaj later told Gulf News, a Dubaibased daily. He de­clined to com­ment fur­ther to The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Amul, a ma­jor In­dian dairy brand, has also said it does not want to be associated with hate.</p>
    <p>Dr R.S. Sodhi, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor of the Gu­jarat Co-op­er­a­tive Milk Mar­ket­ing Fed­er­a­tion, which owns and man­ages the Amul brand, told ST: “We have con­veyed to tele­vi­sion chan­nels pub­licly (through me­dia in­ter­views) that the brand should not be associated with any un­sub­stan­ti­ated news that spreads hate.”</p>
    <p>This push­back from ad­ver­tis­ers comes amid grow­ing crit­i­cism of how tele­vi­sion chan­nels have cov­ered the al­leged sui­cide of a young Bol­ly­wood ac­tor, seek­ing to lay the blame on his for­mer girl­friend.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions into a re­ported fake tele­vi­sion ratings scan­dal have also forced ad­ver­tis­ers to reeval­u­ate their me­dia strat­egy.</p>
    <p>“Tele­vi­sion news has gone way too far down the rab­bit hole. It is no longer a ques­tion of po­lit­i­cal par­ti­san­ship or pro­pa­ganda, all of which has been around for many years,” said Ms Man­isha Pande, ex­ec­u­tive ed­i­tor of Newslaun­dry, a me­dia critique and cur­rent af­fairs site.</p>
    <p>“This is about chan­nels now fu­elling out­right mis­in­for­ma­tion, hate and tox­i­c­ity against in­di­vid­u­als and com­mu­ni­ties.”</p>
    <p>Last Oc­to­ber, Newslaun­dry be­gan a se­ries named Blood­lust TV to call out TV an­chors, chan­nels and spon­sors of tele­vi­sion de­bates that prop­a­gate hate.</p>
    <p>French car­maker Renault stopped ad­ver­tis­ing on Repub­lic Bharat, a Hindi news chan­nel, in May this year af­ter be­ing called out by the web­site and other groups.</p>
    <p>Amul, too, faced crit­i­cism in Au­gust for ad­ver­tis­ing on Su­dar­shan News, a con­tro­ver­sial chan­nel that in­vited wide­spread crit­i­cism for its se­ries of pro­grammes that in­sin­u­ated Mus­lim “in­fil­tra­tion” into the coun­try’s bu­reau­cracy.</p>
    <p>Dr Sodhi said that when Amul was made aware of this, it reached out to the chan­nel to ask that it not dis­play the brand with any such topic. The chan­nel com­plied with the brand’s re­quest.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, Face­book pro­hib­ited con­tent that “de­nies or dis­torts” the Holo­caust, fol­low­ing a pro­longed cam­paign that saw many ad­ver­tis­ers pull out their sup­port for the so­cial me­dia firm.</p>
    <p>“Such an ad­ver­tis­ing boy­cott won’t sink Face­book but that’s not the point,” said Mr Akash Ban­er­jee, founder of The DeshBhakt, an on­line plat­form for satire and me­dia critique. “The point is to make peo­ple un­der­stand that these guys are prof­it­ing from hate, that these peo­ple de­lib­er­ately al­low con­tent that gen­er­ates ha­tred, de­bate and out­rage so that they can earn from it,” he told ST.</p>
    <p>The boy­cott of Face­book in July is be­lieved to have con­vinced de­ci­sion-mak­ers within the so­cial me­dia gi­ant to tackle hate speech more ef­fec­tively.</p>
    <p>If ad­ver­tis­ers pull out, Mr Ban­er­jee added, me­dia firms tend to be­have bet­ter. “Be­cause they are not here for the na­tion as they would like to say. They are here for the cash.”</p>
    <p>Ms Pande said news con­sumers need to stop be­ing pas­sive.</p>
    <p>“They need to ac­tively but po­litely call out the me­dia when there is mis­re­port­ing and de­mand ac­count­abil­ity, de­mand bet­ter of the me­dia as well as brands,” she told ST. “Ul­ti­mately, a Parle or an Amul makes its money from cit­i­zens of In­dia – Hin­dus and Mus­lims alike – so com­mu­ni­ties, who are de­monised by news chan­nels they fund, have the right to ques­tion brands for their choices.”</p>
    <p>This push­back from ad­ver­tis­ers comes amid grow­ing crit­i­cism of how tele­vi­sion chan­nels have cov­ered the al­leged sui­cide of a young Bol­ly­wood ac­tor, seek­ing to lay the blame on his for­mer girl­friend.</p>
