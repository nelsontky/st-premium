    <p>• Last month was the world’s third-hottest July on record, new data shows – the lat­est mile­stone i n a global warm­ing trend that has seen the three hottest Julys within the past five years.</p>
    <p>With the heat has come a high level of ice melt in the Arc­tic, where the ex­tent of sea ice last month hit the low­est level for July since the po­lar satel­lite record-keep­ing be­gan four decades ago, ac­cord­ing to the Euro­pean Union’s Coper­ni­cus Cli­mate Change Ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The new find­ings come as France and Bel­gium brace them­selves for a pos­si­ble week­end heat wave, while Ital­ian roads near an Alpine glacier were closed amid warn­ings that high tem­per­a­tures could cause ice to col­lapse.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just a sum­mer thing,” said Coper­ni­cus se­nior sci­en­tist Freja Vam­borg. “It’s on a global scale, and all months are warm­ing.”</p>
    <p>At­mo­spheric tem­per­a­ture records dat­ing back to the mid-19th cen­tury re­veal the past five years to be the hottest yet. In terms of records for the month of July, only 2019 and 2016 were warmer com­pared with last month.</p>
    <p>Last month, the US states of New Mex­ico and Texas posted record highs. The Mid­dle East also saw record heat, with Bahrain record­ing its hottest July since 1902.</p>
    <p>Even above the wa­ters of the north-east­ern Pa­cific Ocean, sea sur­face tem­per­a­tures reached nearly 5 deg C above the 40-year av­er­age in some places, the data shows.</p>
    <p>In the Arc­tic, which has been warm­ing at more than twice the global rate in re­cent decades, the ex­panse of sea ice shrank to its low­est level recorded for any July since 1979. The data ser­vice said satel­lite im­ages re­veal ice-free con­di­tions “al­most ev­ery­where” along the Siberian coast­line – a ship­ping route that, un­til a few years ago, could be crossed only with an ice­break­ing ves­sel.</p>
    <p>“It’s dif­fi­cult to talk about av­er­age con­di­tions in the Arc­tic,” where ice cover fluc­tu­ates from year to year, Dr Vam­borg said. “But this is a very, very clear down­ward trend over the last 40 years.”</p>
    <p>The heat has also been linked with wild­fires that have been scorch­ing patches of Siberian for­est and per­mafrost since mid-June. An image on Wed­nes­day from a Coper­ni­cus satel­lite showed a mas­sive smoke cloud over the re­mote Rus­sian re­gion.</p>
    <p>Car­bon monox­ide lev­els over Siberia sug­gest the wild­fires “re­ally took off” in the past two years, said Coper­ni­cus se­nior sci­en­tist Mark Par­ring­ton, who tracks wild­fire emis­sions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Siberian fires this year have al­ready re­leased roughly 200 mil­lion tonnes of car­bon diox­ide – more than in any of the pre­vi­ous 17 years, he said.</p>
