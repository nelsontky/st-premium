    <p>Prices and ren­tals of in­dus­trial space fell year on year in the sec­ond quar­ter and will con­tinue to see down­ward pres­sure in the com­ing quar­ters due to the pan­demic, said in­dus­trial land and in­fra­struc­ture agency JTC Corp.</p>
    <p>Prices of i ndus­trial space de­clined by 1.7 per cent year on year and 1.1 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter, while rents came down by 0.8 per cent year on year and 0.7 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter.</p>
    <p>Oc­cu­pancy rates bucked the trend by edg­ing up 0.1 per­cent­age point year on year and 0.2 per­cent­age point quar­ter on quar­ter to 89.4 per cent, lifted by sin­gle-user fac­tory and ware­house space. This stemmed from pre-com­mit­ments and stock­pil­ing and stor­age. But oc­cu­pancy rates for mul­ti­ple-user fac­to­ries and busi­ness park space fell.</p>
    <p>High­light­ing that the data might not have fully cap­tured the eco­nomic im­pact of Covid-19, JTC said: “Some trans­ac­tions were pre-com­mit­ted be­fore the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, and there was a rel­a­tive lack of re­cent mar­ket trans­ac­tions.”</p>
    <p>JTC also flagged that most con­struc­tion ac­tiv­i­ties were halted due to the cir­cuit breaker and some project own­ers could not pro­vide com­plete as­sess­ments on con­struc­tion progress. For sta­tis­ti­cal com­pi­la­tion and re­port­ing, the ex­pected com­ple­tion pe­ri­ods for such projects were ex­tended by three months from the orig­i­nal ex­pected com­ple­tion pe­riod.</p>
    <p>As of end last month, around 1.3 mil­lion sq m of new in­dus­trial space is ex­pected to be com­pleted in the sec­ond half of this year, while only 0.2 mil­lion sq m of new in­dus­trial space was com­pleted in the sec­ond quar­ter. This sug­gests new in­dus­trial space will not meet the ear­lier pro­jec­tion of 2.1 mil­lion sq m for this year.</p>
    <p>JTC said: “We can expect fur­ther de­lays in com­ple­tion for some in­dus­trial build­ing projects, as project own­ers and con­trac­tors ad­just to meet the Build­ing and Con­struc­tion Au­thor­ity’s Safe Restart re­quire­ments.”</p>
    <p>For in­dus­tri­al­ists look­ing to own pro­duc­tion spa­ces, there were 147 units to­talling about 74,000 sq m in un­com­pleted devel­op­ments avail­able for sale at the end of the sec­ond quar­ter this year.</p>
