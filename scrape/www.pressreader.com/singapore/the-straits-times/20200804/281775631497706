    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has ex­panded the reach of the Chi­nese en­ter­tain­ment app Tik­Tok in Sin­ga­pore even as con­cerns mount over its se­cu­rity and pri­vacy is­sues.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the mo­bile app an­a­lyt­ics firm Sen­sor Tower, an es­ti­mated 1.04 mil­lion new down­loads were racked up in Sin­ga­pore dur­ing the pe­riod be­tween Jan­uary and July.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­na­tional ver­sion of the app, launched in Septem­ber 2017, has about 3.4 mil­lion users here based on to­tal down­loads from the Google Play Store and Ap­ple’s App Store, a spokesman for Sen­sor Tower told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter has about 2.3 mil­lion users here while Face­book and In­sta­gram’s users in Sin­ga­pore num­ber 8.7 mil­lion and 5.2 mil­lion, re­spec­tively. This is ac­cord­ing to Sen­sor Tower’s data, which dates back to Jan­uary 2014.</p>
    <p>Tik­Tok is most pop­u­lar among young adults and teenagers, said Dr Crys­tal Abidin, a se­nior re­search fel­low in In­ter­net stud­ies at Curtin Univer­sity who has re­searched on­line user be­hav­iour pat­terns.</p>
    <p>But she said this trend has shifted some­what amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, when in­flu­encers and brands in search of new au­di­ences have ex­panded their reach to new plat­forms.</p>
    <p>“This di­ver­si­fied the age range in terms of pro­fes­sional creators who are mak­ing money off the plat­forms,” Dr Abidin said. “We also saw a lot of news an­chors, tra­di­tional en­ter­tain­ment celebri­ties, politi­cians and other pub­lic fig­ures who used to band­wagon onto Face­book and sub­se­quently In­sta­gram, also mi­grate onto Tik­Tok dur­ing Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Dr Abidin said re­cent up­dates to the app, such as the re­lease of fea­tures like livestream­ing and ad­ver­tis­ing, have brought more spon­sored posts and cor­po­rate part­ner­ships onto the plat­form, with its con­tent be­com­ing more pro­fes­sional as a re­sult.</p>
    <p>Avid Sin­ga­pore fans of the app told ST they were drawn by its hu­mor­ous short-form videos, which typ­i­cally last any­where from a few sec­onds to a minute. Its sim­plic­ity also means any­one can be­come a con­tent cre­ator, they said.</p>
    <p>Some of Tik­Tok’s most pop­u­lar con­tent fea­tures danc­ing, lip-sync­ing and short skits set to au­dio clips, which are end­lessly re­pro­duced, par­o­died and re-imag­ined by ca­sual users, in­flu­encers and big­time celebri­ties alike.</p>
    <p>Re­search as­sis­tant Nikki Chin, 25, said she uses Tik­Tok daily and can spend hours on it. She spends more time on Tik­Tok than all other so­cial me­dia plat­forms, like Face­book and In­sta­gram, com­bined. “I use Tik­Tok to just laugh and un­wind. Also, I’m re­ally into memes and I feel Tik­Tok is filled with them.”</p>
    <p>Ms Chin added that she has heard about the con­cerns sur­round­ing the app but is un­fazed as she is mainly a viewer and does not pro­duce any videos.</p>
    <p>Mr Ni­cholas Tan, an an­a­lyst with a tech­nol­ogy firm, said the app’s main ap­peal for him is see­ing how users adapt a joke to many dif­fer­ent con­texts and make it uniquely theirs.</p>
    <p>“I like watch­ing point-of-view TikToks where an in­di­vid­ual can mimic a char­ac­ter we all know very well, like a school prin­ci­pal, and it be­comes hi­lar­i­ous be­cause it is so re­lat­able,” said the 25-year-old, who uses the app for about an hour a day.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said he would con­tinue to use Tik­Tok. “The con­tent is hi­lar­i­ous and I’m sure ByteDance (Tik­Tok’s par­ent com­pany) is do­ing some­thing to ad­dress th­ese ru­mours and con­cerns, and per­haps change the way data is be­ing col­lected,” he said.</p>
    <p>Some other users, how­ever, have ditched the plat­form as they are wary of the app’s se­cu­rity flaws and the amount of data it col­lects.</p>
    <p>Ad­ver­tis­ing ex­ec­u­tive Ben­jamin See, 27, who used to spend an hour putting to­gether 15-se­cond videos on the app, said: “I deleted it about a month ago.”</p>
