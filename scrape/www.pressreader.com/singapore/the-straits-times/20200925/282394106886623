    <p>TOKYO • Olympic boss Thomas Bach said yes­ter­day that the Tokyo Games could take place next year even without a coronaviru­s vac­cine, point­ing to the suc­cess of the Tour de France.</p>
    <p>Strik­ing an op­ti­mistic note at a meet­ing with Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ers, he vowed to make the post­poned event a tri­umph de­spite the un­cer­tain­ties of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“We can see that sport is com­ing back slowly but surely, and that a num­ber of big sport events have been suc­cess­fully or­gan­ised re­cently, in­clud­ing matches in dif­fer­ent Ja­panese leagues,” he said via a video link from the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee (IOC) head­quar­ters in Lau­sanne, Switzer­land.</p>
    <p>“Also very com­plex events like the Tour de France and oth­ers, which showed to us and showed to the world that we can or­gan­ise safe sport events even without a vac­cine.”</p>
    <p>The Tour de France – the world’s big­gest cy­cling race – started with an in­ter­na­tional field of 176 rid­ers on Aug 29 and fol­lowed a 3,484km course over three weeks.</p>
    <p>IOC head Bach said a vac­cine and progress in rapid test­ing “would of course greatly fa­cil­i­tate” hold­ing the Olympics.</p>
    <p>The 2020 Games were post­poned ear­lier this year as the deadly new ill­ness spread around the globe.</p>
    <p>They are now set to open on July 23 next year, with or­gan­is­ers in­sist­ing they will go ahead in some form – and be safe for all in­volved.</p>
    <p>Drugs com­pa­nies are rac­ing to pro­duce an ef­fec­tive jab to counter a virus that has now killed more than 980,000 peo­ple around the world and in­fected over 32 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral lead­ing vac­cine can­di­dates are cur­rently in late-stage tri­als.</p>
    <p>Bach said it was im­pos­si­ble to make a con­tin­gency plan for ev­ery sce­nario, and said or­gan­is­ers would not be pres­sured into mak­ing pre­ma­ture an­nounce­ments on how the Games would take place.</p>
    <p>“We have to work dili­gently and we have to work com­pre­hen­sively, and then at the ap­pro­pri­ate time, take the right de­ci­sions,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This work will con­tinue un­til the open­ing of the Olympics. This cri­sis re­quires a lot of flex­i­bil­ity and sac­ri­fice from all of us.</p>
    <p>“I’m sure that we will make... these Olympic Games, which will be his­toric in dif­fer­ent re­spects, a suc­cess, and we will make it a suc­cess to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Bach and new Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga spoke by tele­phone on Wed­nes­day and agreed to co­op­er­ate closely to stage a safe and se­cure Games for ath­letes and spec­ta­tors.</p>
    <p>“We are sit­ting to­gether in one boat. The only thing we have to do now is to row in the same di­rec­tion,” Bach said dur­ing the meet­ing, in which Tokyo Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike, Olympics Min­is­ter Seiko Hashimoto and other of­fi­cials par­tic­i­pated.</p>
