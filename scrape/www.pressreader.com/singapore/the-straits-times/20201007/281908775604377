    <p>In­done­sia is caught in a blame game as its Covid-19 cases surge.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment has blamed it on the fail­ure of peo­ple to com­ply with safety pro­to­cols but crit­ics say the gov­ern­ment has pri­ori­tised re­sus­ci­tat­ing the econ­omy over deal­ing with the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Much of the anger against the gov­ern­ment has been di­rected at Health Min­is­ter Ter­awan Agus Pu­tranto. Thou­sands of In­done­sians have signed an on­line pe­ti­tion call­ing for his dis­missal be­cause he has</p>
    <p>“failed” to curb the surge in cases.</p>
    <p>About 40,000 peo­ple so far have signed the pe­ti­tion posted on the Change.org web­site last Wed­nes­day by a coali­tion of civil so­ci­ety and so­cial groups, and aca­demics.</p>
    <p>“From the be­gin­ning, Health Min­is­ter Ter­awan has taken this out­break lightly. His han­dling (of the pan­demic) is not se­ri­ous,” the coali­tion wrote.</p>
    <p>They de­manded that Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo re­place the min­is­ter with some­one more com­pe­tent.</p>
    <p>Dr Irma Hi­dayana, one of the pe­ti­tion or­gan­is­ers, told The Straits Times more than 250 health work­ers had suc­cumbed to the virus due to lack of pro­tec­tive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, In­done­sia, the world’s fourth most pop­u­lous coun­try with 270 mil­lion peo­ple, had recorded 311,176 Covid-19 cases, the sec­ond high­est in South-east Asia af­ter the Philip­pines. But In­done­sia has the high­est death toll in the re­gion with 11,374 fa­tal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The main rea­sons for the spike in cases in South-east Asia’s largest econ­omy in­clude in­suf­fi­cient test­ing, weak con­tact trac­ing and the lift­ing of large-scale so­cial dis­tanc­ing, known lo­cally by the acro­nym PSBB, in the prov­inces since June.</p>
    <p>The pub­lic has crit­i­cised the gov­ern­ment’s han­dling of the health cri­sis, say­ing it was more con­cerned about the econ­omy than pub­lic health.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Joko, in a video state­ment last Satur­day, said: “Pri­ori­tis­ing health mat­ters does not mean we are sacri­fic­ing the econ­omy, be­cause sacri­fic­ing the econ­omy is equal to sacri­fic­ing the lives of tens of mil­lions of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“Over­com­ing the pan­demic is dif­fi­cult, it re­quires hard work to­gether, but I’m sure we can do it.</p>
    <p>“The most im­por­tant thing in this sit­u­a­tion is that we should not be in­dulging in polemics and there should be no com­mo­tion.”</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Covid-19 task force has blamed the pub­lic for ig­nor­ing health pro­to­cols such as wear­ing masks and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Jakarta, a city of 11 mil­lion, re­mains the worst-hit place in the coun­try, ac­count­ing for 80,979 cases and 1,802 deaths as of yes­ter­day. The city’s ad­min­is­tra­tion has re-im­posed a par­tial lock­down to try and con­tain the spread of the virus amid re­ports of a short­age of hos­pi­tal beds to treat pa­tients.</p>
    <p>Other badly af­fected prov­inces are West Java, Cen­tral Java and East Java. And tourism-de­pen­dent Bali, whose econ­omy has been hit se­verely, has had to de­lay a plan to wel­come for­eign vis­i­tors by Septem­ber, push­ing it back in­stead to the end of this year. The re­sort is­land, which re­opened to lo­cal tourists in July, has re­fo­cused ef­forts on this front for now.</p>
