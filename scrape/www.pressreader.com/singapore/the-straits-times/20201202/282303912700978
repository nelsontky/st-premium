    <p>Sov­er­eign debt has spiked glob­ally, spark­ing con­cerns that it may be un­sus­tain­able.</p>
    <p>Deficits have widened this year due to un­prece­dented fis­cal stim­u­lus to cush­ion the im­pact of Covid-19 and fall­ing tax rev­enues, said the Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS).</p>
    <p>“To­gether with the eco­nomic con­trac­tion caused by Covid-19, sov­er­eign debt as a per­cent­age of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) rose and could con­tinue to do so should fur­ther fis­cal sup­port be deemed nec­es­sary,” it said in its Fi­nan­cial Sta­bil­ity Re­view that was re­leased yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the joint World Bank-In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund (IMF) Debt Sus­tain­abil­ity Frame­work, the pan­demic has had a neg­a­tive ef­fect on low-in­come coun­tries’ sol­vency and liq­uid­ity. More than 50 per cent of them are now as­sessed to be in debt dis­tress or at a high risk of it.</p>
    <p>Loose credit and as­set pur­chase pro­grammes by cen­tral banks since the on­set of the pan­demic have brought down the cost of bor­row­ing. But while the sit­u­a­tion does not ap­pear dire in ad­vanced economies and the Asean-4 – In­done­sia, Malaysia, the Philip­pines and Thai­land – the MAS said ris­ing sov­er­eign debt as a per­cent­age of GDP raises the risk of a loss of in­vestor con­fi­dence, which in turn puts pres­sure on debt re­fi­nanc­ing.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ments is­su­ing large num­bers of se­cu­ri­ties to fund the Covid-19 re­sponse will also have be­come more in­ter­con­nected with banks, it noted.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, banks in the euro zone pe­riph­ery have in­creased their hold­ings of sov­er­eign debt.</p>
    <p>The MAS added that higher bank ex­po­sure raises the like­li­hood of spillovers to the bank­ing sys­tem through two main chan­nels: “First, a repric­ing of gov­ern­ment se­cu­ri­ties could lead to sig­nif­i­cant mark-to-mar­ket losses for banks, with knock-on ef­fects on cap­i­tal po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>“Se­cond, a de­cline in sov­er­eign credit rat­ings could im­pact banks’ own credit rat­ings, in­creas­ing bank fund­ing costs, which could cur­tail their will­ing­ness and abil­ity to pro­vide credit.”</p>
    <p>The MAS also ob­served that cap­i­tal flows to emerg­ing mar­ket economies re­main volatile. Geopo­lit­i­cal risks and the re­sult­ing pol­icy un­cer­tainty, too, may ad­versely im­pact in­vestor con­fi­dence.</p>
    <p>The reg­u­la­tor said that while progress in vac­cine de­vel­op­ment could bol­ster eco­nomic prospects in the lat­ter half of next year, much de­pends on the vac­cines’ ef­fec­tive­ness and de­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>In the past few weeks, news of promis­ing in­terim re­sults for three vac­cine can­di­dates has come thick and fast, sending stock mar­kets soar­ing.</p>
    <p>But fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity risks will re­main el­e­vated in the medium term, said the MAS, and pol­i­cy­mak­ers need to tread a care­ful bal­ance be­tween supporting eco­nomic re­cov­ery and man­ag­ing risks to fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity. “Th­ese down­side risks need to be adequately recog­nised, es­pe­cially given the present dis­con­nect be­tween mar­ket val­u­a­tions and the real econ­omy,” it said.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, the IMF warned that soar­ing eq­uity val­u­a­tions point to stronger prospects of re­cov­ery than ac­tual ac­tiv­ity in the pan­demic-hit real econ­omy sug­gests.</p>
    <p>“Pol­i­cy­mak­ers will need to work with in­dus­try to strengthen the re­silience of the fi­nan­cial sys­tem, in­clud­ing by fa­cil­i­tat­ing changes to mar­ket struc­ture that ad­dress the vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties re­vealed by the cri­sis,” the MAS said.</p>
