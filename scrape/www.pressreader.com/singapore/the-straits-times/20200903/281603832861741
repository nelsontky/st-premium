    <p>Covid-19 will not be Sin­ga­pore’s last pub­lic health cri­sis, and the coun­try can ap­ply lessons it has learnt in man­ag­ing this dis­ease to pre­pare for fu­ture pan­demics, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
    <p>He noted that sci­en­tists talk about Dis­ease X – a new un­known dis­ease that is highly in­fec­tious, deadly and mu­tates eas­ily – be­ing over­due.</p>
    <p>When Covid-19 started to spread around the world, PM Lee said peo­ple asked if Dis­ease X had ar­rived.</p>
    <p>“Covid-19 has been a dis­as­ter for the world, but it is not Dis­ease X,” said PM Lee dur­ing the de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress in Par­lia­ment yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“It is by far not the worst new dis­ease that can be­fall mankind.”</p>
    <p>PM Lee noted that in the 17 years since the se­vere acute res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome out­break, the Mid­dle East res­pi­ra­tory syn­drome (Mers), H1N1 and Ebola have all emerged as threats. H1N1 was highly trans­mis­si­ble but mostly mild, Mers was for­tu­nately not very trans­mis­si­ble, and Ebola re­mained con­fined in some African coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Dis­ease X rep­re­sents the knowl­edge that a se­ri­ous in­ter­na­tional epi­demic could be caused by a pathogen cur­rently un­known to cause hu­man dis­ease, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>He warned that it is only a mat­ter of time be­fore Dis­ease X hap­pens, and Sin­ga­pore should be pre­pared.</p>
    <p>“So we had bet­ter learn from Covid-19, how to deal with a pan­demic, and be as ready as we can, should a worse one – when a worse one – be­falls us,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>“We should build up our re­silience, our in­stincts, our prepa­ra­tions. So that when Dis­ease X comes one day, we will be pre­pared.”</p>
