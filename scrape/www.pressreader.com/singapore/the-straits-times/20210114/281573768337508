        <p>The wa­ter in the wa­ter­way run­ning through Sen­tosa South Cove has turned an un­nat­u­ral pink­ish pur­ple, alarm­ing res­i­dents. Warn­ing signs emerged on Jan 5 when a foul smell came from the wa­ter­way. As the odour be­came stronger over the next few days, dead fishes were found near the banks from Wed­nes­day to Sun­day.</p>
        <p>The wa­ter­way run­ning through Sen­tosa South Cove has turned an un­nat­u­ral pink­ish-pur­ple since Tues­day af­ter­noon, alarm­ing res­i­dents.</p>
        <p>Warn­ing signs emerged on Jan 5 when a foul, sewage-like smell came from the wa­ter­way. As the odour be­came stronger over the next few days, dead fish were found near the banks from Wed­nes­day last week to Sun­day.</p>
        <p>Last Satur­day saw the “largest clean-up and haul of dead fish”, said Knight Frank Prop­erty As­set Man­age­ment on be­half of Sen­tosa Cove Re­sort Man­age­ment (SCRM), in a let­ter sent to res­i­dents on Mon­day, which was seen by The Straits Times.</p>
        <p>Ma­rine ex­perts iden­ti­fied rab­bit­fish, moony­fish, bat­fish and leather­jacket fish among the dead fish.</p>
        <p>In re­sponse to queries from ST, an SCRM spokesman said dead fish were ob­served in the wa­ter­way of South Cove be­tween Jan 6 and last Satur­day, and sub­se­quently, a change in colour in the wa­ters on Tues­day. The North Cove wa­ter­way has not been af­fected.</p>
        <p>The re­sort man­age­ment is work­ing with the Na­tional Environmen­t Agency (NEA) on in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p>
        <p>“As a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, SCRM has ad­vised res­i­dents to re­frain from wa­ter sport ac­tiv­i­ties in the wa­ter­way. SCRM will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the wa­ters,” said the spokesman.</p>
        <p>Dr San­dric Leong, se­nior re­search fel­low at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Trop­i­cal Ma­rine Sci­ence In­sti­tute, said the coloured wa­ter was caused by a pico-cyanobac­te­ria bloom – a form of al­gae bloom.</p>
        <p>A bloom is caused when a large amount of al­gae or cyanobac­te­ria ac­cu­mu­lates in the wa­ter, re­sult­ing from high amounts of nu­tri­ents such as phos­pho­rus and ni­tro­gen.</p>
        <p>Dr Leong said the heavy and per­sis­tent rain over the past cou­ple of weeks may have con­trib­uted to the bloom.</p>
        <p>“The fast-adap­ta­tion char­ac­ter­is­tics of cyanobac­te­ria to sud­den changes in en­vi­ron­men­tal con­di­tions, like the re­cent con­tin­u­ous rain­fall, en­able cyanobac­te­ria to out­com­pete other phy­to­plank­ton or al­gae. Due to the rain­fall, the light con­di­tion was low, and cyanobac­te­ria could grow bet­ter in low light lev­els,” he said.</p>
        <p>The sec­ond mon­soon surge for this month brought heavy and per­sis­tent rain to the is­land last week­end, and Jan 2 saw rain­fall that was among the heav­i­est in 39 years.</p>
        <p>The NEA said there is no in­di­ca­tion of any in­dus­trial or ma­rine pol­lu­tion that could have af­fected the wa­ters in the sur­round­ing area.</p>
        <p>Al­gae blooms can re­move dis­solved oxy­gen from the wa­ter, harm­ing ma­rine life. But it is un­clear if the fish deaths and coloured wa­ter are linked, ex­perts em­pha­sised.</p>
        <p>Com­mon causes of fish deaths in­clude oxy­gen de­pri­va­tion, tox­ins pro­duced by al­gae blooms, and high con­cen­tra­tions of al­gae species that can dam­age the gills of fish, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Fed­erico Lauro from Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s Asian School of the Environmen­t.</p>
        <p>The let­ter on Mon­day to Sen­tosa res­i­dents said the wa­ter­ways were combed on Mon­day morn­ing and no dead fish were found, and the foul smell had also cleared up.</p>
        <p>When res­i­dents thought the worst was over, the wa­ters turned pink­ish-pur­ple on Tues­day.</p>
        <p>“The smell dur­ing the week­end was aw­ful. Even up on the eighth floor where I live, you could still smell it. It smelled like dead fish and sewage,” said a res­i­dent of Seas­cape con­do­minium who de­clined to have her name pub­lished.</p>
        <p>Mr Dan Paris, 54, a res­i­dent of South Cove’s Turquoise con­do­minium, be­moaned how life­less the wa­ter­way has be­come this past week.</p>
        <p>“In Sen­tosa Cove, you have this ma­rine life around you – fish, herons, ot­ters. I didn’t see any ot­ters last week­end,” said Mr Paris, who works in mar­ket­ing.</p>
        <p>“And the herons, ea­gles and king­fish­ers were pick­ing up the dead fish float­ing in the wa­ters. Those fish might be con­tam­i­nated.”</p>
        <p>The ex­perts said wa­ter cir­cu­la­tion be­tween the wa­ter­ways and the sea­wa­ter be­yond South Cove can help to break up the al­gae and bring in fresher salt­wa­ter, which will in­crease the oxy­gen lev­els in the wa­ter­ways.</p>
