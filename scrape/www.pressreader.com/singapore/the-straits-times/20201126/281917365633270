    <p>ZURICH A Swiss woman who knifed a vic­tim in the neck and grabbed an­other by the throat in a Lugano depart­ment store on Tues­day was a known mil­i­tant who fell in love with an Is­lamist mil­i­tant on­line and had tried in vain to meet him in Syria, po­lice said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral prose­cu­tors have called the in­ci­dent in the Ital­ian-speak­ing south­ern can­ton of Ti­cino a sus­pected ter­ror­ist at­tack and taken charge of the in­ves­ti­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>“Po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tions in 2017 re­vealed that the woman had formed a re­la­tion­ship via so­cial me­dia with a ji­hadist fighter from Syria,” the Fed­eral Of­fice of Po­lice (Fed­pol) tweeted.</p>
    <p>The Turk­ish au­thor­i­ties turned her away at the border to Syria when she tried to travel there to meet the man, and re­turned her to Switzer­land at the time, it added.</p>
    <p>“The woman was suf­fer­ing from men­tal health prob­lems at this time. Af­ter re­turn­ing to Switzer­land, she was ad­mit­ted to a psy­chi­atric clinic,” Fed­pol added, say­ing she had not come to its at­ten­tion in any ter­ror-re­lated in­ves­ti­ga­tion since 2017.</p>
    <p>The 28-year-old woman, who lives in the area, was in cus­tody af­ter passers-by sub­dued her un­til the po­lice ar­rived.</p>
    <p>One vic­tim had se­ri­ous but non­life-threat­en­ing in­juries, and an­other had light in­juries.</p>
    <p>Neu­tral Switzer­land has so far been spared the kind of large-scale mil­i­tant at­tacks that prompted France and Germany this month to push for tighter Euro­pean Union bor­ders, af­ter sus­pected Is­lamist mil­i­tants killed eight peo­ple in Paris, Nice and Vi­enna within a month.</p>
    <p>But Switzer­land has iden­ti­fied hun­dreds of res­i­dents deemed a threat and mil­i­tants who have trav­elled to war zones. Two men ar­rested in the town of Win­terthur this month over pos­si­ble links to a mil­i­tant shoot­ing at­tack in Vi­enna that killed four peo­ple on Nov 2 had vis­ited the at­tacker in July.</p>
    <p>In Septem­ber, a man Swiss me­dia dubbed the “Emir of Win­terthur” and de­scribed as a lead­ing Is­lamist mil­i­tant in Switzer­land was sen­tenced to 50 months in prison for ties to the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria.</p>
    <p>Fed­eral prose­cu­tors said the fa­tal stab­bing of a Por­tuguese man in Septem­ber in the town of Morges, in western Switzer­land, was still be­ing in­ves­ti­gated for a pos­si­ble “ter­ror­ist mo­tive”.</p>
    <p>A Swiss-Turk­ish na­tional has been ar­rested.</p>
