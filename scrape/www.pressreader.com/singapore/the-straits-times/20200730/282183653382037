    <p>An ini­tia­tive by United Overseas Bank (UOB) has brought wel­come re­lief to par­ents who were wor­ried about how their chil­dren would cope when schools closed in April and home-based learn­ing kicked in.</p>
    <p>With eight school-go­ing chil­dren at home and only one lap­top to share among them, Rachel (not her real name), 39, was afraid her chil­dren would fall be­hind.</p>
    <p>“It was a very chal­leng­ing time when the schools closed. We only had one lap­top at home and it was over­all quite tough for the kids,” said the wid­owed mother of nine.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the UOB My Dig­i­tal Space pro­gramme proved to be a life­line for the fam­ily, by pro­vid­ing them with two lap­tops.</p>
    <p>Un­der the scheme, UOB gives out dig­i­tal learn­ing kits to stu­dents from low-in­come fam­i­lies in Sin­ga­pore, Brunei, Hong Kong and Malaysia. It will even­tu­ally in­clude In­done­sia and Thai­land.</p>
    <p>More than 560 kits have been dis­trib­uted to stu­dents across the region, in­clud­ing about 250 in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>UOB has also part­nered with Sing­tel and Sin­ga­pore Press Hold­ings to help Sin­ga­pore stu­dents by do­nat­ing a Wi-Fi pack­age and a com­pli­men­tary sub­scrip­tion to The Straits Times and a ver­nac­u­lar news­pa­per of the stu­dent’s choice, as part of these kits.</p>
    <p>The lap­tops are on loan to the stu­dents for a year, with an op­tion to ex­tend the loan pe­riod, de­pend­ing on their needs.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents who get the lap­tops also have ac­cess to an on­line re­source cen­tre where they can learn about top­ics such as sus­tain­abil­ity and cy­ber se­cu­rity, be­yond their school cur­ricu­lum.</p>
    <p>Rachel said it was a re­lief to re­ceive the de­vices as “there was no need for the kids to fight” to use the one lap­top at home.</p>
    <p>Her daugh­ter Joy (not her real name), who is in Pri­mary 1, said she en­joyed hav­ing lessons on­line. She added that now, she does not have to bor­row her el­dest brother’s lap­top when­ever she has home-based learn­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­sides this ini­tia­tive, UOB has also raised more than $1.65 mil­lion from staff and cus­tomers for the UOB Heart­beat Covid-19 Re­lief</p>
    <p>Fund, which helps 31 ben­e­fi­cia­ries across the region.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the fund has gone to­wards pro­duc­ing 500,000 3Dprinted face shields for front-line health­care work­ers at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal and the Na­tional Cen­tre for In­fec­tious Dis­eases, as well as pro­vid­ing es­sen­tial food sup­plies to nearly 900 needy fam­i­lies with school-go­ing chil­dren for a year.</p>
    <p>Ms Lil­ian Chong, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of UOB’s group strate­gic com­mu­ni­ca­tions and brand, said the bank aims to dis­trib­ute one mil­lion pieces of per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment to health­care work­ers and those in need.</p>
    <p>“Given its far-reach­ing im­pact, we wanted to ex­tend the reach of our cor­po­rate so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity pro­gramme, UOB Heart­beat, to help vul­ner­a­ble com­mu­ni­ties in these try­ing times,” she added.</p>
