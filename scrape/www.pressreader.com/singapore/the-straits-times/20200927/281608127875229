    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The United States’ top in­fec­tious dis­ease expert has said the coun­try could face a “prob­lem­atic” au­tumn and win­ter in the fight against the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The com­ments by Dr An­thony Fauci, direc­tor of the Na­tional In­sti­tute of Al­lergy and In­fec­tious Dis­eases, came as the US sur­passed the grim mile­stone of over seven mil­lion to­tal in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>“We’re afraid things could ac­tu­ally get worse,” Dr Fauci said in an interview with Ir­ish pub­lic broad­caster RTE.</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to get our base­line down; we’ve got to get con­trol of this.”</p>
    <p>But he also struck an op­ti­mistic note, say­ing the pan­demic will end, and it should be clear by the end of the year whether a safe vac­cine has been de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, in neigh­bour­ing Canada, the coun­try’s two most pop­u­lous prov­inces on Friday moved to clamp down fur­ther on so­cial gath­er­ings, in a bid to slow a sec­ond wave of coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions that now to­tal more than 150,000 na­tion­wide.</p>
    <p>On­tario or­dered the clo­sure of bars and restau­rants from mid­night to 5am, ex­cept for take­outs and de­liv­er­ies, and said strip clubs would have to shut down from yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Premier Doug Ford, whose gov­ern­ment has al­ready slashed the size of per­mit­ted gath­er­ings in­doors and out­doors, re­peated his con­cerns that the ma­jor­ity of new cases were peo­ple un­der 40.</p>
    <p>“I can tell you I don’t see seniors go­ing into night­clubs too of­ten,” he told a daily brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Health of­fi­cials in Canada have been mak­ing in­creas­ingly gloomy com­ments in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>Dr Theresa Tam, the chief pub­lic health of­fi­cer, told re­porters on Friday that some lo­cal au­thor­i­ties could be over­whelmed un­less the wave was curbed.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Justin Trudeau said at the same event: “We now have ac­tive cases in ev­ery sin­gle prov­ince.</p>
    <p>“What we do now will be crit­i­cal for the weeks and months to come.”</p>
    <p>In Que­bec, Health Min­is­ter Chris­tian Dube urged res­i­dents to cut down on so­cial in­ter­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“We’re ask­ing you to make a spe­cial ef­fort for the next 28 days,” he told a news con­fer­ence, say­ing the gov­ern­ment did not want to close bars be­cause peo­ple might then at­tend pri­vate par­ties that are harder to con­trol.</p>
    <p>On­tario and Que­bec to­gether ac­count for 79 per cent of the 150,456 cases re­ported in Canada so far and 93 per cent of the 9,255 deaths.</p>
    <p>Mr Trudeau said Canada has signed a deal with As­traZeneca to buy up to 20 mil­lion doses of its Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date.</p>
    <p>It is among the lead­ing can­di­dates in the global race for a vac­cine.</p>
