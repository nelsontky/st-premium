    <p>• E-com­merce con­glom­er­ate Alibaba, hand­set maker Xiaomi and WuXi Bi­o­log­ics will en­ter Hong Kong’s Hang Seng In­dex next month, the bench­mark’s pub­lisher an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Alibaba and Xiaomi, along with de­liv­ery plat­form Meituan Dian­ping, will also j oin the H-share Hang Seng China Enterprise­s In­dex, which rep­re­sents Chi­nese com­pa­nies listed in the city.</p>
    <p>Changes to both in­dexes are ef­fec­tive Sept 7.</p>
    <p>About $19.7 bil­lion of as­sets un­der man­age­ment i n ex­change­traded prod­ucts was linked to the Hang Seng In­dex, with an­other $5.4 bil­lion tied to the H-share in­dex as of last month, the in­dex provider said.</p>
    <p>The Hang Seng In­dex will drop Sino Land, Want Want China and China Shen­hua En­ergy, while</p>
    <p>Sinopharm, BYD and Citic Se­cu­ri­ties will leave the H-share in­dex.</p>
    <p>The long-awaited in­clu­sion of tech giant Alibaba marks a mile­stone in one of the big­gest re­vamps in the ex­change’s 50-year his­tory.</p>
    <p>It comes as the Hang Seng In­dexes un­veiled the first ma­jor changes un­der new rules to al­low dual-class shares and sec­ondary list­ings.</p>
    <p>The em­brace of bench­mark-beat­ing tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies is con­sid­ered an over­due move for an un­der­per­form­ing gauge that is over­stuffed with banks and fi­nan­cial stocks.</p>
    <p>The Hang Seng In­dex is down 11 per cent for the year, com­pared with a 13 per cent gain for China’s CSI 300 In­dex and the Nas­daq Com­pos­ite’s 23 per cent rise.</p>
    <p>Its com­piler re­cently launched a new mea­sure fo­cused on China’s tech giants to pro­vide in­vestors bet­ter ac­cess to their in­creas­ing sway in the city’s equity mar­ket.</p>
    <p>“The in­evitable trend is for Hong Kong’s equity bench­mark to lose more lo­cal fea­tures and rep­re­sent more of the Chi­nese econ­omy,” said Mr Jack­son Wong, as­set man­age­ment di­rec­tor at Am­ber Hill Cap­i­tal. “Adding these com­pa­nies will help it bet­ter re­flect changes in the city’s equity mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>At least 26 com­pa­nies out the 50 Hang Seng mem­bers gen­er­ate the ma­jor­ity of their rev­enue from the main­land.</p>
    <p>More list­ings of Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy firms are in the pipe­line. List­ing closer to home has be­come more at­trac­tive as ten­sions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Bei­jing threaten to cur­tail Chi­nese com­pa­nies’ ac­cess to US cap­i­tal markets.</p>
    <p>Dual-class and sec­ondary list­ings will each be sub­ject to a 5 per cent weight­ing cap. Dual-class shares were long blocked from list­ing in Hong Kong due to con­cern over un­equal vot­ing rights un­til Xiaomi Corp’s de­but in 2018.</p>
    <p>Alibaba joined the bourse last year after a US$13 bil­lion (S$17.8 bil­lion) sec­ondary list­ing. Its stock has gained around 18 per cent in Hong Kong since Hang Seng In­dexes un­veiled in May the new list­ing rules that would make it el­i­gi­ble to join the bench­mark.</p>
