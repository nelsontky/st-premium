    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia said yes­ter­day that it had opened an in­ves­ti­ga­tion and would take le­gal ac­tion against the world’s largest glove man­u­fac­turer, Top Glove, af­ter find­ing that the firm did not com­ply with stan­dards for worker ac­com­mo­da­tions.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Hu­man Re­sources’ Labour Depart­ment said that en­force­ment op­er­a­tions were car­ried out last week at six of Top Glove’s com­pa­nies in five states, in­ves­ti­gat­ing con­di­tions at worker ac­com­mo­da­tions and hos­tels.</p>
    <p>Nine­teen in­ves­ti­ga­tions have been opened and the depart­ment has rec­om­mended charges against the man­u­fac­turer, but it did not spec­ify how many.</p>
    <p>The depart­ment said the op­er­a­tions were prompted by a Covid-19 out­break at a Top Glove fac­tory in an in­dus­trial area near Kuala Lumpur last month.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tors found the ac­com­mo­da­tions to be cramped and un­com­fort­able, to have poor ven­ti­la­tion and to lack rest and kitchen ar­eas, Depart­ment of Labour Penin­su­lar Malaysia di­rec­tor-gen­eral Asri Ab Rah­man told re­porters.</p>
    <p>He said that charges would be filed, and that the depart­ment would con­tinue to con­duct such op­er­a­tions from time to time.</p>
    <p>“There is con­cern at the min­istry and pres­sure on the depart­ment to en­sure that worker ac­com­mo­da­tions pro­vided do not be­come the source of spread­ing diseases, and that does not be­come the rea­son the coun­try is con­victed of forced labour,” he said.</p>
    <p>Malaysia shut down some of Top Glove’s fac­to­ries in stages last week to fa­cil­i­tate screen­ing and quar­an­tin­ing em­ploy­ees for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Top Glove has around 21,000 em­ploy­ees glob­ally, with about 11,000 in Malaysia. About 5,900 of the Malaysia-based work­ers live in the com­pany’s premises in Se­lan­gor’s Klang district.</p>
    <p>Tighter curbs on move­ment, in place since Nov 14, in the ar­eas where the fac­to­ries and hos­tels are lo­cated have been ex­tended to Dec 14.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 3,406 Top Glove work­ers tested pos­i­tive by Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Malaysia yes­ter­day logged 1,472 new Covid-19 in­fec­tions, bring­ing to­tal cases to 67,169, said the Health Min­istry. There were three new fa­tal­i­ties, tak­ing the coun­try’s death toll to 363.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 13 ho­tels in Jo­hor have ceased op­er­a­tions this year due to the sharp drop in vis­i­tors, Ber­nama news agency quoted the state’s Tourism, Youth and Sports Com­mit­tee chair­man Onn Hafiz Ghazi as say­ing.</p>
