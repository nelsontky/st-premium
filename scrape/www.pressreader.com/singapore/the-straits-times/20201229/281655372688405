    <p>KUALA LUMPUR Malaysia is ad­vis­ing peo­ple who have tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus but have no Covid-19 symp­toms to self-iso­late at home first, as cases in­volv­ing for­eign work­ers are surg­ing.</p>
    <p>These asymp­to­matic pa­tients should keep in con­tact with their district health of­fices, said the Health Min­istry’s direc­tor-gen­eral, Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Ab­dul­lah.</p>
    <p>These pa­tients may not be taken to hos­pi­tals im­me­di­ately as the health­care sys­tem is over­loaded, Malay Mail on­line news re­ported him as say­ing yes­ter­day. He said hos­pi­tals are cur­rently at 59 per cent of their bed ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is grap­pling with lo­gis­ti­cal is­sues such as the fer­ry­ing of peo­ple to hos­pi­tals and a high num­ber of for­eign work­ers be­ing tested and found to have Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“We are talk­ing about more than 1,000 cases a day. This is be­cause of in­creased test­ing among for­eign work­ers and, as ex­pected, more cases be­ing di­ag­nosed,” Dr Noor Hisham said, as quoted by Malay Mail. “For­eign work­ers have no place to be isolated in... We have thou­sands here.”</p>
    <p>Malaysia has stepped up the test­ing of for­eign work­ers for Covid-19. En­force­ment on the manda­tory Covid-19 screen­ing for for­eign work­ers will start on Jan 1 for six high-risk states and fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries, said Hu­man Re­sources Min­is­ter M. Sar­a­vanan, The Star daily re­ported.</p>
    <p>These states com­prise Se­lan­gor, Negeri Sem­bi­lan, Pe­nang and Sabah, along with the fed­eral ter­ri­to­ries of Kuala Lumpur and Labuan, in­volv­ing some 800,000 for­eign work­ers.</p>
    <p>Datuk Seri Sar­a­vanan said that as at Sun­day, a to­tal of 68,460 for­eign work­ers had been screened, in­volv­ing 2,385 em­ploy­ers, ac­cord­ing to The Star.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties have been check­ing in­tensely on for­eign­worker ac­com­mo­da­tion in the last few weeks and is­su­ing fines to com­pa­nies, in­clud­ing glove mak­ers, for housing the mi­grants in cramped and poor con­di­tions that have partly caused the spread of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Malaysia last Satur­day logged a record high num­ber of daily cases since the start of the pan­demic, with 2,335 in­fec­tions. Kuala Lumpur made up the largest share – 31.2 per cent – of the new in­fec­tions, with 728 cases. This was fol­lowed by Se­lan­gor with 710 cases and Jo­hor with 412 cases.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment yes­ter­day ex­tended the con­di­tional move­ment con­trol or­der for Se­lan­gor and Sabah as well as the fed­eral ter­ri­tory of KL by two more weeks to Jan 14.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Health Min­istry has dou­bled the num­ber of beds at a gov­ern­ment quar­an­tine and treat­ment cen­tre in Ser­dang, Se­lan­gor, to more than 6,000 due to the ris­ing num­ber of Covid-19 cases. The ca­pac­ity at the cen­tre could be fur­ther raised to 10,000 beds if re­quired, the min­istry said.</p>
