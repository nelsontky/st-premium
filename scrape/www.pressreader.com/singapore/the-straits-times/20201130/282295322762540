    <p>The frail el­derly and post-surgery pa­tients who are too weak to un­dergo phys­i­cal re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion may be able to do so when a pro­tein in the body is ac­ti­vated by mag­netic fields, caus­ing mus­cles to re­spond as if the pa­tient has ex­er­cised.</p>
    <p>A team of re­searchers from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) are hope­ful that now that they un­der­stand how the TRPC1 pro­tein re­sponds to mag­netic fields, it can lead to tar­geted ther­apy.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alfredo Franco-Obre­gon from the univer­sity’s In­sti­tute for Health In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy said that with TRPC1-based ther­a­pies, in­ten­sive care unit (ICU) pa­tients may not have to wait till they can move to un­dergo re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion and re­gain their mus­cle strength.</p>
    <p>“Drug de­vel­op­ment can take place... You can make a drug that ac­ti­vates TRPC1. You can re­in­sti­tute TRPC1 to dam­aged tis­sues.</p>
    <p>“By know­ing the tar­get, we know the pro­cesses in­volved, and now we have a way of reg­u­lat­ing that process,” said Prof Fran­coObre­gon, who is also from the NUS depart­ment of surgery.</p>
    <p>Last year, the re­searchers de­vel­oped a mag­netic field-gen­er­at­ing de­vice and tested it on pa­tients and se­niors.</p>
    <p>When a num­ber of se­niors used the de­vice, the re­searchers found that by plac­ing their legs in the cylin­dri­cal ma­chine twice a week, for 10 weeks, the se­niors saw at least a 10 per cent in­crease in their limb strength.</p>
    <p>But it was only re­cently that Prof Franco-Obre­gon and his team un­der­stood why this hap­pened.</p>
    <p>They learnt that when TRPC1 was ex­posed to mag­netic fields, it started tak­ing up cal­cium, which ac­ti­vated a cas­cade of en­zymes and sub­stances that caused mus­cles to pro­duce en­ergy and get stronger.</p>
    <p>To prove that mag­netic fields ac­ti­vated the pro­tein, the re­searchers cre­ated vesi­cles – tiny sacs containing TRPC1 – and in­serted them into mu­tant mus­cle cells that had the pro­teins re­moved. The TRPC1 in the vesi­cles re­sponded to the mag­netic fields and started tak­ing up cal­cium.</p>
    <p>The NUS team, which worked with the Swiss Fed­eral In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy on the TRPC1 study, had their pa­per fea­tured on the cover of the jour­nal Ad­vanced Biosys­tems last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Prof Franco-Obre­gon is hope­ful that tar­geted ther­apy can be ad­min­is­tered to pre­vent the loss of mus­cle in ICU pa­tients and se­niors.</p>
    <p>“Nat­u­rally, we start los­ing mus­cle from about midlife un­til we die. It gets crit­i­cal when se­niors de­velop sar­cope­nia – a con­di­tion where you have so lit­tle mus­cle that you can’t even sup­port bod­ily func­tions. Your other sys­tems start to go ka­put, and you be­come even less ac­tive. And then the process just ac­cel­er­ates.</p>
    <p>“Our hope is that by ac­ti­vat­ing TRPC1, we can short-cir­cuit that es­cape from con­trol.”</p>
    <p>There may be an­other ben­e­fit – when mus­cles are ac­ti­vated ei­ther through ex­er­cise or the pro­tein, a se­ries of meta­bolic ac­tiv­i­ties are also trig­gered, from burn­ing fat to</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Alfredo Franco-Obre­gon of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s In­sti­tute for Health In­no­va­tion and Tech­nol­ogy show­ing an im­age with the dif­fer­ent mus­cle fibre types. The green fi­bres are those where TRPC1, which con­fers sen­si­tiv­ity to mag­netic fields, is most prom­i­nent. in­creas­ing in­sulin sen­si­tiv­ity, which re­duces blood sugar lev­els.</p>
    <p>With that in mind, Prof Fran­coObre­gon is cur­rently car­ry­ing out clin­i­cal tri­als with mod­er­ately di­a­betic pa­tients to see if TRPC1-based ther­apy can re­duce the pa­tients’ re­liance on drugs to man­age their di­a­betes.</p>
    <p>But there is a catch. If a cer­tain class of an­tibi­otics, called amino­gly­co­sides, are in the body, the TRPC1 pro­tein gets blocked and is un­able to re­spond to mag­netic fields and me­chan­i­cal forces like ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Amino­gly­co­side an­tibi­otics are used to treat con­di­tions such as ab­domen, uri­nary tract and blood­stream in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>This means that frail, di­a­betic or post-surgery pa­tients who are on these an­tibi­otics can­not ben­e­fit from TRPC1.</p>
    <p>For such pa­tients, other an­tibi­otics have to be used, or this gap could drive fur­ther med­i­cal re­search, said Prof Franco-Obre­gon.</p>
