    <p>Sev­eral Or­chard Road malls – Wisma Atria, The Cen­tre­point, Ngee Ann City and Lucky Plaza – were among the lat­est places vis­ited by in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Also newly added to the list of lo­ca­tions that coro­n­avirus pa­tients vis­ited were Com­pass One in Sengkang, Jewel Changi Air­port, Nex and FairPrice Hub in Joo Koon.</p>
    <p>Nex was on the list ear­lier, but a fresh visit there was recorded, this time at the Din Tai Fung restau­rant in the mall. MOH pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes and the times they vis­ited them to get peo­ple who were at those places to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from when they were there.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied, and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if nec­es­sary</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a new clus­ter in a dor­mi­tory was an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>MOH said 33 pa­tients were linked, form­ing a new clus­ter at Blue Stars Dor­mi­tory at 3 Kian Teck Lane.</p>
    <p>The min­istry also said it has con­tacted 254 peo­ple who vis­ited SLR Revo­lu­tion at Ex­cel­sior Shop­ping Cen­tre be­tween Aug 15 and 18, and helped them get tested.</p>
    <p>This was done af­ter three pa­tients who had worked at or vis­ited the shop were con­firmed to have Covid-19, even though the risk of in­fec­tion for vis­i­tors was as­sessed to be low.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 250 in­di­vid­u­als were tested as of yes­ter­day, and all the re­sults have come back neg­a­tive, said MOH. It is fa­cil­i­tat­ing test­ing for the re­main­ing four peo­ple who have yet to be swabbed.</p>
    <p>No cases in the com­mu­nity were re­ported yes­ter­day, but there were three im­ported pa­tients, all of whom ar­rived from In­dia.</p>
    <p>Among them are a Sin­ga­porean and a per­ma­nent res­i­dent who ar­rived sep­a­rately on Aug 23 and Aug 28.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing pa­tient is a short­term visit pass holder who ar­rived on Aug 26. He was al­lowed en­try into Sin­ga­pore as his spouse has been seek­ing med­i­cal treat­ment here, said MOH.</p>
    <p>All three had been placed on 14-day stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and were tested while serv­ing their no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 37 of the 40 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 56,948.</p>
    <p>Among the 37, five were iden­ti­fied ear­lier as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases, and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to pre­vent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing 32 cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as bi­weekly ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has in­creased from two cases two weeks ago to three in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also risen from a daily av­er­age of one case to two cases over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 146 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 56,159 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 51 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal as of yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, while 696 were re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
