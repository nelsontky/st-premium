    <p>WASH­ING­TON The Repub­li­can­led US Se­nate Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee has ap­proved Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s nom­i­na­tion of Ms Amy Coney Bar­rett to a life­time US Supreme Court seat, de­spite a Demo­cratic boy­cott, clear­ing the way for a full Se­nate vote on her con­fir­ma­tion planned for next Mon­day.</p>
    <p>By a 12-0 vote, the panel yes­ter­day ap­proved Ms Bar­rett, with all Repub­li­can mem­bers vot­ing yes and the 10 com­mit­tee Democrats boy­cotting the meet­ing after call­ing the con­fir­ma­tion process a sham.</p>
    <p>With Mr Trump’s fel­low Repub­li­cans hold­ing a 53-47 Se­nate ma­jor­ity, Ms Bar­rett’s con­fir­ma­tion ap­pears cer­tain.</p>
    <p>Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee chair­man Lind­sey Gra­ham said the Demo­cratic boy­cott was “their choice”, adding: “We’re not go­ing to al­low them to take over the com­mit­tee.”</p>
    <p>Mr Gra­ham called the com­mit­tee vote “a ground-break­ing his­toric mo­ment”.</p>
    <p>The empty seats for the Demo­cratic com­mit­tee mem­bers had posters placed on them for the meet­ing. The posters car­ried pho­to­graphs of peo­ple whom the Democrats ar­gue would be hurt if the Af­ford­able Care Act health­care law, also known as Oba­macare, is struck down, as Mr Trump has sought in a case to be ar­gued be­fore the jus­tices on Nov 10.</p>
    <p>Ms Bar­rett has crit­i­cised pre­vi­ous rul­ings up­hold­ing Oba­macare, but said dur­ing her con­fir­ma­tion hear­ings that she has no agenda to in­val­i­date the mea­sure.</p>
    <p>The con­fir­ma­tion of Ms Bar­rett, a fed­eral ap­peals court judge, would ex­pand the top US ju­di­cial body’s con­ser­va­tive ma­jor­ity to 6-3.</p>
    <p>Democrats were in­censed that Se­nate Repub­li­cans moved for­ward with the nom­i­na­tion so near an elec­tion after re­fus­ing in 2016 to al­low the Cham­ber to act on a Supreme Court nom­i­na­tion by Mr Trump’s Demo­cratic pre­de­ces­sor, Mr Barack Obama, be­cause it was an elec­tion year.</p>
    <p>Se­nate Ma­jor­ity Leader Mitch McCon­nell’s plan for a con­fir­ma­tion vote next Mon­day would en­able the Se­nate to con­firm Ms Bar­rett be­fore the Nov 3 elec­tion as Mr Trump has re­quested.</p>
    <p>In an­nounc­ing their boy­cott of yes­ter­day’s vote, Se­nate Demo­cratic leader Chuck Schumer and Ju­di­ciary Com­mit­tee Democrats said they “will not grant this process any fur­ther le­git­i­macy by par­tic­i­pat­ing” in the com­mit­tee’s vote so near the elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump nom­i­nated Ms Bar­rett to suc­ceed the late lib­eral Jus­tice Ruth Bader Gins­burg. Ms Bar­rett is Mr Trump’s third Supreme Court nom­i­nee as he moves it fur­ther to the right.</p>
    <p>No nom­i­nee to the Supreme Court has ever been con­firmed by the Se­nate this close to a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>A favourite of Chris­tian con­ser­va­tives, Ms Bar­rett frus­trated Judi</p>
    <p>ciary Com­mit­tee Democrats dur­ing her con­fir­ma­tion hear­ing last week by sidestep­ping ques­tions on abor­tion, pres­i­den­tial pow­ers, cli­mate change, vot­ing rights, Oba­macare and other is­sues.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old is a de­vout Catholic who per­son­ally op­poses abor­tion.</p>
    <p>Se­nate Repub­li­cans have made con­fir­ma­tion of Mr Trump’s con­ser­va­tive ju­di­cial ap­pointees a high pri­or­ity. Mr Trump has said he be­lieves the Supreme Court will de­cide the elec­tion’s out­come and has made it clear that he wants Ms Bar­rett on the bench for any elec­tion­re­lated cases.</p>
    <p>Repub­li­cans are hop­ing that Ms</p>
    <p>Bar­rett’s con­fir­ma­tion can give an elec­tion boost to in­cum­bent sen­a­tors in the party fac­ing tough re­elec­tion fights, in­clud­ing Mr Gra­ham in South Carolina and panel mem­bers Joni Ernst in Iowa and Thom Til­lis in North Carolina.</p>
    <p>In an interview with CBS pro­gramme 60 Min­utes, Mr Trump’s Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den said that if elected, he would cre­ate a bi­par­ti­san com­mis­sion of con­sti­tu­tional schol­ars to look into ju­di­cial re­forms, say­ing there could be var­i­ous “al­ter­na­tives” to con­sider be­sides ex­pand­ing the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den said the ju­di­ciary is“get­ting out of whack”.</p>
