    <p>The sight of el­derly Sin­ga­pore­ans clean­ing hawker cen­tre ta­bles and toi­lets or col­lect­ing dis­carded card­board for sale pricks the hearts of Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>Many, un­der­stand­ably, see it as in­dica­tive of cracks in our so­cial safety net that are in ur­gent need of mend­ing.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­na­tional me­dia, from the United States to China, has chipped in with com­men­taries ex­press­ing sen­ti­ments rang­ing from as­ton­ish­ment to con­dem­na­tion.</p>
    <p>Our pol­icy re­sponse must be guided by a thor­ough un­der­stand­ing of the facts. For ex­am­ple, how many of th­ese el­derly Sin­ga­pore­ans work out of ne­ces­sity and how many out of choice?</p>
    <p>What are the cir­cum­stances of those who work out of ne­ces­sity and how can they be helped? For those who do not need to but choose to work, are there other jobs for them that are less phys­i­cally de­mand­ing?</p>
    <p>Can those who choose to work to re­main ac­tive be per­suaded to pur­sue more com­fort­able op­tions that are equally ef­fec­tive in keep­ing them ac­tive?</p>
    <p>This is a po­ten­tially po­lit­i­cally charged is­sue for which an ob­jec­tive and com­pre­hen­sive pic­ture has not yet been ob­tained.</p>
    <p>From time to time, spe­cific cases of the el­derly do­ing me­nial work are high­lighted and, of­ten, gov­ern­ment agen­cies then come out to pro­vide fur­ther facts to as­sure Sin­ga­pore­ans that as­sis­tance is al­ready be­ing pro­vided.</p>
    <p>But what is needed is a com­pre­hen­sive and re­li­able pic­ture of the is­sue so that Sin­ga­pore­ans can have some un­der­stand­ing of the cir­cum­stances be­hind a sight that trou­bles them. An independen­t and sub­stan­tive sur­vey is called for.</p>
