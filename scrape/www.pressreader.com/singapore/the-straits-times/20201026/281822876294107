    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s lead­ers yes­ter­day of­fered con­do­lences to Brunei’s Sultan Has­sanal Bolkiah on the death of his son, Prince ‘Abdul ‘Azim.</p>
    <p>In a let­ter to the Bruneian ruler, Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob said the Prince will be greatly missed by Brunei cit­i­zens.</p>
    <p>“He will be re­mem­bered for his pas­sion for the arts and kind­ness to the needy,” she said.</p>
    <p>Prince ‘Abdul ‘Azim died on Satur­day. He was 38.</p>
    <p>News of his death was re­ported by Brunei’s state broad­caster Ra­dio Tele­vi­sion Brunei in an of­fi­cial an­nounce­ment and also by the Bor­neo Bul­letin news­pa­per.</p>
    <p>The cause of his death was not stated.</p>
    <p>Brunei is now in a seven-day mourn­ing pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong paid trib­ute to the late prince, say­ing that Prince ‘Abdul ‘Azim was known for his kind and gen­er­ous spirit, and for his ded­i­ca­tion to char­i­ta­ble, ed­u­ca­tional and youth causes.</p>
    <p>“It was Sin­ga­pore’s priv­i­lege to have had the op­por­tu­nity to host him in our schools for his pri­mary and sec­ondary ed­u­ca­tion,” said PM Lee.</p>
    <p>“I re­call him from my in­ter­ac­tions with him over the years, as a per­son with great char­ac­ter. He will be dearly missed.”</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­is­ter Vivian Balakr­ish­nan also ex­tended his con­do­lences to the Sultan.</p>
    <p>“Through his com­pas­sion and em­pa­thy, Prince ‘Abdul ‘Azim had en­deared him­self to Bruneians and all who knew him,” said Dr Balakr­ish­nan.</p>
    <p>Fourth in line to suc­ceed the throne of Brunei, Prince ‘Abdul ‘Azim was the sec­ond-born prince of the Sultan.</p>
    <p>He was born in Ban­dar Seri Be­gawan on July 29, 1982, and stud­ied at Internatio­nal School Brunei, Sin­ga­pore’s Raf­fles In­sti­tu­tion and Ox­ford Brookes Univer­sity.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Bor­neo Bul­letin, the late prince was laid to rest at the Royal Mau­soleum in the Bruneian cap­i­tal on Satur­day.</p>
