    <p>There were nine new im­ported coro­n­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>There were no new com­mu­nity cases and none from work­ers’ dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>The lat­est cases take Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 58,386. The im­ported cases in­clude two Sin­ga­pore­ans and a Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent who re­turned from In­dia and Aus­tria. They were all asymp­to­matic.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing cases are three work per­mit hold­ers who are cur­rently em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, a de­pen­dant’s pass holder, a short-term visit pass holder and a special pass holder.</p>
    <p>The special pass holder ar­rived here from In­dia to board a ship docked here as a crew mem­ber.</p>
    <p>MOH said all the im­ported cases had been placed on stay-home no­tice, or were iso­lated upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and were tested dur­ing that pe­riod.</p>
    <p>MOH added that the num­ber of new cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained low, with no new cases in the past week.</p>
    <p>With 13 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 58,250 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the disease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 36 pa­tients re­mained in hos­pi­tal yes­ter­day, with none in in­ten­sive care, and 56 pa­tients were still re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 29 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break, which be­gan in De­cem­ber last year, has in­fected more than 74.2 mil­lion peo­ple. More than 1.6 mil­lion peo­ple have died.</p>
