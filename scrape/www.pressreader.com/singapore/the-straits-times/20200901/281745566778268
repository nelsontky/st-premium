    <p>The oper­a­tors of three food es­tab­lish­ments have been or­dered to close their premises by the Sin­ga­pore Food Agency (SFA) for flout­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
    <p>S-Tripes Hot­pot, a restau­rant in Have­lock Road, will have to close from to­mor­row to Sept 11, af­ter SFA of­fi­cers found that it had flouted the mea­sures on multiple oc­ca­sions.</p>
    <p>This in­cluded sell­ing al­co­holic bev­er­ages af­ter 10.30 pm.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant’s staff trans­ferred the al­co­holic bev­er­ages into teapots and empty green tea bot­tles be­fore serv­ing them to avoid de­tec­tion. Staff were also not wear­ing masks or not wear­ing them prop­erly de­spite re­minders to do so, said the agency.</p>
    <p>The restau­rant was fined $2,000 for the of­fences.</p>
    <p>Whim­si­cal Bar in Science Park Drive was or­dered to close with im­me­di­ate ef­fect af­ter SFA of­fi­cers found that cus­tomers were con­sum­ing al­co­holic bev­er­ages af­ter 10.30pm.</p>
    <p>The bar had also al­lowed groups of more than five peo­ple to sit to</p>
    <p>gether and min­gle, the SFA said in a re­lease last night.</p>
    <p>The bar was also found to be op­er­at­ing with­out a food shop li­cence, and ta­bles were placed less than 1m apart. It will have to re­main closed un­til a li­cence is ob­tained, said the agency.</p>
    <p>Its ad­ja­cent unit, Cre­ate Kitchen, also vi­o­lated sim­i­lar safe man­age­ment mea­sures, and was or­dered to close from to­mor­row to Sept 11. Both th­ese busi­nesses were fined $1,000 each for the of­fences.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Covid-19 (Tem­po­rary Mea­sures) Act 2020, first-time of­fend­ers can be sen­tenced to a fine of up to $10,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.</p>
    <p>Re­peat of­fend­ers may face a fine of up to $20,000, im­pris­on­ment of up to twelve months, or both.</p>
