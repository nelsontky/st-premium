    <p>First, apolo­gies. I have to say sorry to ev­ery­one who went to GV Plaza last Tues­day evening.</p>
    <p>They were hop­ing to have a quiet screen­ing of Digi­mon Ad­ven­ture: Last Evo­lu­tion Kizuna, a movie fea­tur­ing anime char­ac­ters they love.</p>
    <p>When they got there, they saw a weird, sweaty guy in a wig, a grotesque and ob­scene ver­sion of their beloved icon Taichi Yagami.</p>
    <p>As they stood in line for tick­ets, he would lunge at them, scream­ing: “Wanna take a pic­ture with me?”, like a street ped­dler push­ing knick-knacks on tourists.</p>
    <p>To say this low-bud­get mas­cot was poorly pre­pared would be gen­er­ous. Not only did he know noth­ing of his char­ac­ter, but he also had the twitchy en­ergy of a guy who took the job be­cause no­body else was des­per­ate enough.</p>
    <p>The real Taichi is hand­some, tall and smooth-com­plex­ioned; this guy is Taichi if he were made of cheese and left un­der a hot grill.</p>
    <p>Their looks of dis­gust and pity should have warned him off, but in a man­ner that only a sick mind could un­der­stand, the re­vul­sion he saw in their eyes only made him greed­ier for at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>So to ev­ery­one who saw me cos­play: I’m sorry. I did not mean to ruin your cher­ished mem­o­ries.</p>
    <p>I was go­ing to be the only cos­player there meet­ing fans at the screen­ing, so be­fore I left, I did some In­ter­net research.</p>
    <p>Two facts jumped out. Pro­fes­sional cos­play­ers tend to be young and at­trac­tive. They also tend to be women. Since I am nei­ther, I would have to rely on other skills, such as in­tim­i­da­tion and beg­ging.</p>
    <p>The good peo­ple at Golden Vil­lage rented the cos­tume for me. It was re­ally my fault that I looked like a poor man’s ver­sion of an anime cos­player. If I had given them more no­tice, they might have been able to find what I re­ally wanted, which was a mon­ster suit that en­cased me – and my shame – com­pletely.</p>
    <p>For back­ground, the Digi­mon fran­chise be­gan, as these things tend to do, in Ja­pan. From a toy and game, it be­came an anime tele­vi­sion se­ries in the 2000s. So while there were a few kids in the fan crowd that showed up at GV Plaza, most were folks of vot­ing age and be­yond, ca­pa­ble of sniff­ing out a bam­boo­zle if they saw one.</p>
    <p>But to be hon­est, per­haps it was best that at the short dead­line I had given them, the GV folks were able to pro­cure an out­fit that con­sisted mostly of a wig and gog­gles. Call­ing up ev­ery­thing I had learnt from in­ter­view­ing ac­tors, I “let my wardrobe do the work for me”, as they say in the film trade.</p>
    <p>Out in the lobby area of the cin­ema, where fans queued for tick­ets and gifts, I did my thing. I strut­ted. I twirled. I stuck my Agu­mon mon­ster soft toy into un­car­ing faces. I whipped peo­ple up into a frenzy of ex­cite­ment. And when I say frenzy, I mean a mild state of be­ing aware that I ex­isted and thus make eye con­tact with me rather than scur­ry­ing away as one would from a guy try­ing to talk to you at the bus in­ter­change.</p>
    <p>A few did that thing, where I made an of­fer and they raised a palm to my face to say, “It’s okay.” No, sir. It is very much not okay. To my re­lief, a cou­ple of peo­ple said yes to my selfie of­fer. Per­haps be­cause af­ter long weeks of cir­cuit breaker shel­ter­ing, and more than three months of cin­e­mas go­ing dark, stan­dards had fallen.</p>
    <p>What­ever. I was pumped. I started slowly with just stand­ing next to them – at a 1m safe dis­tance, of course – but as I be­gan warm­ing to my role as am­bas­sador of a beloved Ja­panese cul­tural icon, the poses be­came more in­volved.</p>
    <p>There was the stan­dard “fall­ing back from a punch” and ev­ery­one’s favourite of “look­ing into the dis­tance like he­roes” – and, of course, the ev­er­green “fly­ing with one arm out­stretched”. Then came the piece de re­sis­tance, the “launched into the air by a kick”. As ac­tors go, I must say I’m pretty ver­sa­tile.</p>
    <p>When it was over, per­haps about six or seven per­sons had taken self­ies with the last-minute, slap­dash, make-do mas­cot, and to them, I say thank you. And to the rest, again, I of­fer my apolo­gies. Maybe one day, with ther­apy, you may once again find the in­no­cence you lost last Tues­day.</p>
