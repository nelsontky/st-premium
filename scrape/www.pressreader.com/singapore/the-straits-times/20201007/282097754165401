    <p>Busi­nesses in Sin­ga­pore are set to ben­e­fit from free cy­ber-health screen­ings to spot weak­nesses in their Web do­mains, e-mail sys­tems and con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>This is part of the newly un­veiled Safer Cy­berspace Master­plan 2020, which aims to pro­tect Sin­ga­pore’s dig­i­tal sphere.</p>
    <p>The na­tional plan also out­lines the use of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) to sniff out se­cu­rity threats in key in­fras­truc­ture, in­clud­ing broad­band and 5G net­works, and con­sumer de­vices such as we­b­cams and Wi-Fi routers.</p>
    <p>Co­or­di­nated by the Cy­ber Se­cu­rity Agency (CSA) of Sin­ga­pore, the master­plan is cen­tral to Sin­ga­pore’s plans to lead in AI and Smart Na­tion de­ploy­ment glob­ally, and comes amid the rapid dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion that has taken place in re­cent months.</p>
    <p>“The pan­demic ac­cel­er­ated the pace of change... Telecom­mut­ing, video calls, e-learning, on­line shop­ping and dig­i­tal pay­ment surged,” said Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat when he un­veiled the master­plan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This means Sin­ga­pore must re­dou­ble its ef­forts to fend off cy­ber threats, which are grow­ing, said Mr Heng, who is also Min­is­ter for Fi­nance, at the open­ing of the fifth an­nual Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Cy­ber Week, which is a par­tially vir­tual event this year.</p>
    <p>More than 9,400 cy­ber­crime cases were re­ported last year, an in­crease of more than 50 per cent from the 6,200 cases re­ported in 2018, ac­cord­ing to the Sin­ga­pore Cy­ber Land­scape 2019 report re­leased in June by CSA.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng urged the cy­ber se­cu­rity in­dus­try, busi­nesses and in­di­vid­u­als to do their part, not­ing that a se­cure cy­berspace re­quires col­lec­tive ef­fort, with the master­plan be­ing the Gov­ern­ment’s part.</p>
    <p>The master­plan – which builds on Sin­ga­pore’s 2016 cy­ber se­cu­rity blue­print that in­cluded the roll-out of In­ter­net surf­ing sep­a­ra­tion in the pub­lic sec­tor – was first men­tioned in Par­lia­ment in March.</p>
    <p>CSA said yes­ter­day that one of the key ini­tia­tives is to pro­vide free cy­ber health screen­ings through a por­tal, which will be launched as early as next year.</p>
    <p>Busi­nesses will be able to check in­stantly if their Web do­mains, email sys­tems and Web con­nec­tiv­ity are in the pink of health through the CSA-run In­ter­net Cy­ber Hy­giene Por­tal. Self-help guides and tool­kits will also be avail­able for down­load.</p>
    <p>Also un­der the Master­plan, AI tech­nolo­gies will be pow­er­ing two new sys­tems – a Cy­ber Fu­sion Plat­form and an In­ter­net of Things (IoT) Threat An­a­lyt­ics Plat­form – to de­fend the Re­pub­lic’s cy­berspace against more per­sis­tent, so­phis­ti­cated threats.</p>
    <p>Greater use of AI to boost the na­tion’s cy­ber de­fences is one of the nine key ini­tia­tives un­der Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional AI plan, which was launched last Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>The Cy­ber Fu­sion Plat­form will pro­vide CSA with early warn­ing against ma­li­cious at­tacks by analysing vo­lu­mi­nous on­line data at great speed.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, the In­ter­net of Things or IoT Threat An­a­lyt­ics Plat­form will de­tect and pre­dict im­pend­ing, large-scale IoT at­tacks, thus al­low­ing CSA and other gov­ern­ment agen­cies to take pre-emp­tive strikes against at­tack­ers.</p>
    <p>The two plat­forms could be launched as early as next year.</p>
    <p>The IoT Threat An­a­lyt­ics Plat­form will com­ple­ment an IoT la­bel sim­i­lar to the en­ergy-ef­fi­ciency la­bels on home ap­pli­ances that help buy­ers of smart de­vices bet­ter judge how ex­posed they are to cy­ber risks.</p>
    <p>This la­bel, which is cur­rently be­ing rolled out, can be vol­un­tar­ily pasted on Wi-Fi routers and smart home hubs, for a start. It will in­di­cate if the de­vice mak­ers en­sure that de­fault pass­words are not used, among other as­sess­ment cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>“Mov­ing for­ward, we would like to work with other coun­tries to es­tab­lish mu­tual recog­ni­tion for cy­ber se­cu­rity la­belling and col­lec­tively advance the se­cu­rity stan­dards of IoT de­vices world­wide,” said Mr Heng, not­ing that tech firms have a “cy­ber duty of care” to their cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>“Co­op­er­a­tion be­tween coun­tries, across busi­nesses, and with our peo­ples will make all the dif­fer­ence as we build back bet­ter from Covid-19.”</p>
