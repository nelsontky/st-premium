    <p>As In­dia saw its big­gest sin­gle-day jump in new Covid-19 cases yes­ter­day, with 75,760 in­fec­tions con­firmed and a tally of over 3.3 mil­lion cases, small but loud groups of pan­demic de­niers and anti-maskers have emerged.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is now en­ter­ing the sev­enth month of mo­bil­ity re­stric­tions and the gov­ern­ment man­dates wear­ing masks in pub­lic. But in a video a week ago, five young peo­ple called for a boy­cott of masks, call­ing them “sym­bols of slav­ery” that are use­less to pre­vent the coro­n­avirus from en­ter­ing the body. They then burned the masks.</p>
    <p>This video had 617,000 views af­ter it was shared by Mr Biswa­roop Roy Chowd­hury, a so­cial me­dia in­flu­encer with a tal­ent for snappy Hindi videos and an evan­gel­i­cal mis­trust of vac­cines and an­tibi­otics.</p>
    <p>Twit­ter took the video down for vi­o­lat­ing its rules, but it is still up on</p>
    <p>Mr Chowd­hury’s YouTube chan­nel.</p>
    <p>He pro­claims to be a doc­tor – on his web­site, Twit­ter han­dle, Face­book ac­count, YouTube chan­nel and in over 25 books. His staff re­fer to him as “Dr Biswa­roop”.</p>
    <p>He has no med­i­cal train­ing, but has a PhD in di­a­betes from Al­liance In­ter­na­tional Uni­ver­sity in Zam­bia. His core busi­ness en­ter­prise com­prises camps across In­dia, Malaysia and Viet­nam that claim to “cure di­a­betes” in 72 hours.</p>
    <p>Since Jan­u­ary, he has de­clared that Covid-19 is “just a flu” and the pan­demic is a “pro­pa­ganda to lock down the world”.</p>
    <p>Re­cent posts in a Face­book group called “The Covid-19 Con­spir­acy By Dr Biswa­roop Roy Chowd­hury”, which has 1,900 mem­bers, show him pho­tographed with the Delhi Chief Min­is­ter and In­dia’s Health Min­is­ter. Both politi­cians are seen hold­ing Mr Chowd­hury’s book on his “cure” for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mr Chowd­hury said his “zero money, zero medicines and zero mor­tal­ity” treat­ment, based on di­etary changes, has “cured over 80 per cent of 21,000 pa­tients of Covid and in­fluenza-like ill­nesses”.</p>
    <p>“My team of 50 peo­ple, me, even my child, in­ter­acted with hun­dreds of peo­ple with Covid. We didn’t wear masks. My an­ti­body sta­tus is neg­a­tive!” he de­clared.</p>
    <p>The on­line “doc­tor” has pre­vi­ously de­nied the ex­is­tence of HIV/Aids, and has claimed to treat cancer and di­a­betes with di­etary changes.</p>
    <p>In 2015, the Delhi Med­i­cal Coun­cil’s Anti-Quack­ery Cell warned the Health Min­istry about Mr Chowd­hury’s “il­le­gal” claims about cur­ing “an in­cur­able dis­ease”.</p>
    <p>Yet, de­spite his du­bi­ous cred­i­bil­ity, a grow­ing num­ber of on­line posts and videos show In­di­ans doubt­ing the ef­fi­cacy of masks, ques­tion­ing vac­cines and re­fus­ing to fol­low so­cial dis­tanc­ing guide­lines.</p>
    <p>The In­dian Coun­cil of Med­i­cal Re­search, which helms anti-Covid-19 poli­cies, has de­clared it “ir­re­spon­si­ble” not to wear masks. Many states im­pose hefty fines on those with­out masks in pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Anti-maskers cite the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s (WHO) changed guide­lines about masks as proof of its in­com­pe­tence.</p>
    <p>In Jan­u­ary, WHO said the use of masks by healthy peo­ple was “not yet sup­ported by high-qual­ity or di­rect sci­en­tific ev­i­dence”. In June, it en­cour­aged the pub­lic to wear masks where phys­i­cal dis­tanc­ing is dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>Dr Anant Bhan, a physi­cian and re­searcher in bioethics and global health, said: “It’s to WHO’s credit that it is up­dat­ing rec­om­men­da­tions as new ev­i­dence comes up. Quacks are ex­ploit­ing this to am­plify con­fu­sions.”</p>
