    <p>Four men aged be­tween 19 and 26 have been ar­rested for their sus­pected in­volve­ment in an armed rob­bery in Jurong Gate­way Road, po­lice said yes­ter­day. The in­ci­dent took place on Thurs­day af­ter­noon at li­censed money­len­der OT Credit, where the men al­legedly con­fined a man­ager in a room and fled with about $48,000.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions found that three of the quar­tet had al­legedly car­ried out the rob­bery. One of them is said to have pointed a knife at a fe­male staff mem­ber, pulled her hair and de­manded that she hand over the money in the unit. The men then al­legedly dragged her into a room in the shop to con­fine her be­fore flee­ing with about $48,000 in cash.</p>
    <p>As one of the rob­bers lunged to­wards her and pulled out a knife, the first thing Ms S. Yang thought of was her three young chil­dren.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old man­ager at a li­censed money­len­der, who de­clined to give her full name, was alone at OT Credit on Thurs­day af­ter­noon when three men walked into the shop at Block 135 Jurong Gate­way Road.</p>
    <p>They had face masks on and did not wear gloves. They fled the scene with about $48,000, said Ms Yang.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day morn­ing, the po­lice in­formed her that the men have been ar­rested.</p>
    <p>“As a mother, the first thing I thought of when I saw the knife was my kids, and what would hap­pen to them if some­thing had hap­pened to me,” Ms Yang told The Straits Times yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Her chil­dren are be­tween two and six years old.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, the po­lice said four men aged be­tween 19 and 26 have been ar­rested for their sus­pected in­volve­ment in an armed rob­bery at a unit in Jurong Gate­way Road.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions found that three of the quar­tet had al­legedly car­ried out the rob­bery.</p>
    <p>One of them is said to have pointed a knife at a fe­male staff mem­ber, pulled her hair and de­manded that she hand over the</p>
    <p>money in the unit. The men then al­legedly dragged her into a room in the shop to con­fine her be­fore flee­ing with about $48,000 in cash.</p>
    <p>The fourth man ar­rested is sus­pected of help­ing to dis­pose of the knife used in the rob­bery.</p>
    <p>Within 12 hours of the rob­bery, of­fi­cers from the Po­lice In­tel­li­gence De­part­ment and Cle­menti Po­lice Di­vi­sion iden­ti­fied the three men who car­ried it out. About $30,000 has been re­cov­ered, with ef­forts to re­cover the rest un­der way.</p>
    <p>All four men are ex­pected to be charged in court today with armed rob­bery with hurt. If con­victed, they face five to 20 years in jail and at least 12 strokes of the cane.</p>
    <p>Com­man­der of the Cle­menti Po­lice Di­vi­sion, Deputy As­sis­tant Com­mis­sioner of Po­lice Marc E, said: “This is a very egre­gious case; it hap­pened in broad day­light in a place where many mem­bers of the pub­lic go. The po­lice will spare no ef­fort to ar­rest such crim­i­nals.”</p>
    <p>Ms Yang, who has worked at OT Credit for five years, said that two of the men vis­ited the shop ear­lier on Thurs­day, be­fore the rob­bery.</p>
    <p>One kept his mo­tor­cy­cle hel­met on while he spoke to her, but she recog­nised him later from his eyes and the foot­ball jer­sey he was wear­ing. The other man opened the door to the shop and poked his head in but did not speak to her.</p>
    <p>When the duo re­turned at about 4pm with an­other man, they asked for a loan. Sud­denly, one of them lunged across the table and grabbed her by her hair while hold­ing a knife, Ms Yang said.</p>
    <p>The other two re­port­edly kept watch in the front and back of the shop as the first man pulled her around by her hair, look­ing for the safe, while still hold­ing the knife.</p>
    <p>Be­fore they fled, they locked her in the back room.</p>
    <p>Staff of the neigh­bour­ing unit, a money changer, told ST they heard Ms Yang knock­ing on the par­ti­tion be­tween the shops and shout­ing for help. Madam Lut­fun­nesa Sha­hanaz, 50, an as­sis­tant man­ager at the money changer, said: “She seemed very shocked and shaken. She said that some­one took their money and ran away. Once we let her out, she called the po­lice.”</p>
