    <p>Trans­port com­pany BM Mo­bil­ity will be delisted from the main­board after it failed to com­ply with con­di­tions that would have al­lowed it to get an ex­ten­sion of time to re­sume trad­ing.</p>
    <p>The com­pany re­ceived a delist­ing no­ti­fi­ca­tion from the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>BM Mo­bil­ity must now pro­vide a rea­son­able exit of­fer to share­hold­ers and in­form the SGX of it “no later than one month from the date of the no­ti­fi­ca­tion of delist­ing”. The firm must also pro­vide up­dates on the sta­tus of the pro­posal.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, which op­er­ates in the ar­eas of green en­ergy, charg­ing equip­ment and elec­tric ve­hi­cles, asked for a trad­ing sus­pen­sion in July last year un­der a list­ing rule where the is­suer is un­able to con­tinue as a go­ing con­cern.</p>
    <p>If trad­ing is sus­pended un­der this rule, a firm must sub­mit a pro­posal with a view to re­sum­ing trad­ing within 12 months of the sus­pen­sion or risk be­ing delisted.</p>
    <p>BM Mo­bil­ity said on May 29 that its in­terim ju­di­cial man­agers had re­ceived a non-bind­ing ex­pres­sion of in­ter­est from an online game de­vel­oper and op­er­a­tor in China for a po­ten­tial re­struc­tur­ing in­volv­ing a trans­fer-of-list­ing ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>The firm said it was en­gag­ing in talks with the com­pany and wanted an ex­ten­sion of time to ob­serve its list­ing obli­ga­tions.</p>
    <p>BM Mo­bil­ity said on June 16 that it had been granted ex­ten­sions un­til Aug 31 to sign an ac­qui­si­tion agree­ment. On Aug 31, it said that no de­fin­i­tive agree­ment had been signed.</p>
    <p>The SGX’s delist­ing no­ti­fi­ca­tion said BM Mo­bil­ity did not ful­fil the con­di­tions for an ex­ten­sion as it had not sub­mit­ted a re­sump­tion pro­posal and no ac­qui­si­tion deal had been signed by the dead­line.</p>
