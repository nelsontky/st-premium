    <p>BANGKOK/SEOUL The deaths of hun­dreds of mainly un­doc­u­mented Thai mi­grant work­ers in South Korea have been un­cov­ered by the Thom­son Reuters Foun­da­tion, prompt­ing the United Na­tions to call for in­quiry into the fate of mi­grants known as “lit­tle ghosts”.</p>
    <p>At least 522 Thais have died in South Korea since 2015 – 84 per cent of whom were un­doc­u­mented – ac­cord­ing to data from the Thai em­bassy in Seoul ob­tained via a Free­dom of In­for­ma­tion (FOI) re­quest.</p>
    <p>Four in 10 deaths were recorded as due to un­known causes while oth­ers were health re­lated, ac­ci­dents and sui­cides.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of worker deaths hit a record an­nual high this year – 122 as at the mid­dle of this month – ac­cord­ing to the newly-re­vealed data from the Thai em­bassy, amid grow­ing con­cerns about the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic on labour con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>More Thais died in South Korea – 283 – than any other for­eign coun­try between 2015 and 2018, ac­cord­ing to data ob­tained via a sep­a­rate FOI re­quest to Thailand’s For­eign Min­istry. There are no avail­able sta­tis­tics for last year and this one.</p>
    <p>“(The data) is con­cern­ing and re­quires at­ten­tion and in­ves­ti­ga­tion,” said Mr Nilim Baruah, a spe­cial­ist on labour mi­gra­tion at the UN In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion, adding: “Un­doc­u­mented mi­grant work­ers are the least pro­tected and their health and safety are a con­cern.”</p>
    <p>Cur­rent and for­mer mi­grant work­ers, cam­paign­ers and Thai of­fi­cials said tens of thou­sands of un­doc­u­mented mi­grants in South Korea were over­worked, un­able to ac­cess health­care, and un­likely to re­port ex­ploita­tion for fear of be­ing de­ported.</p>
    <p>Data on mi­grant deaths is not made pub­lic by ei­ther gov­ern­ment so there is lit­tle at­ten­tion on labour con­di­tions or scope to im­prove the sit­u­a­tion at a time when the fall­out from Covid-19 has left more for­eign work­ers at risk, ac­tivists said.</p>
    <p>The UN In­ter­na­tional Or­gan­i­sa­tion for Mi­gra­tion said it was “con­cerned” about the data un­cov­ered by the Thom­son Reuters Foun­da­tion and was mon­i­tor­ing the sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>South Korea’s min­istries for labour, jus­tice and for­eign af­fairs de­clined to com­ment on the data.</p>
    <p>The South Korean em­bassy in Bangkok did not re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>At least 460,000 Thais work abroad, legally and il­le­gally, ac­cord­ing to sta­tis­tics from Thailand’s For­eign Min­istry.</p>
    <p>South Korea is the top des­ti­na­tion, home to about 185,000 Thai mi­grants who can earn sig­nif­i­cantly more than they would re­ceive in Thailand.</p>
    <p>About a tenth of the 185,000 Thai mi­grants in South Korea work there legally through a labour mi­gra­tion scheme called the em­ploy­ment per­mit sys­tem, the Thai em­bassy in Seoul said.</p>
    <p>The rest are mi­grants with­out le­gal doc­u­men­ta­tion – called phi noi in Thai or “lit­tle ghosts” – who pay bro­kers in Thailand hefty re­cruit­ment fees to or­gan­ise jobs abroad.</p>
    <p>The fees can in­clude pay­ment for flights and ac­com­mo­da­tion in South Korea.</p>
    <p>These mi­grants – who be­come un­doc­u­mented af­ter over­stay­ing a 90-day limit for visa-free travel for Thais in South Korea – said they could earn at least 1.2 mil­lion Korean won (S$1,450) a month, which is more than triple the min­i­mum wage in Thailand.</p>
    <p>Thailand’s For­eign Min­istry has said that its em­bassies are du­ty­bound to look af­ter Thai peo­ple over­seas re­gard­less of their sta­tus, but gain­ing ac­cess to un­doc­u­mented work­ers is dif­fi­cult.</p>
    <p>The Thai em­bassy in Seoul com­piles data on mi­grant deaths based on re­ports from hos­pi­tals or po­lice for deaths that oc­cur at work or home. All deaths are fol­lowed up with an au­topsy but the re­sults are not made pub­lic, ac­cord­ing to the em­bassy.</p>
    <p>“Many il­le­gal Thai work­ers die un­ex­pect­edly dur­ing sleep, likely due to over­work­ing and per­sonal health prob­lems with­out proper med­i­ca­tion,” said Thai of­fi­cial Ban­cha Yueny­ong­chongcharo­en, a min­is­ter at the em­bassy in Seoul.</p>
    <p>“These work­ers un­der­take hard and dirty work and do not have ac­cess to state health­care,” the of­fi­cial said by phone.</p>
    <p>The Asan Mi­grant Work­ers Cen­tre said there were con­cerns that un­doc­u­mented work­ers from other na­tions, in­clud­ing Nepal, Indonesia and Viet­nam, were also dy­ing of un­known causes.</p>
    <p>“If you have no visa, your ac­cess to med­i­cal care is cut off and it’ll cost you 10 mil­lion won to go to the hospi­tal and get surgery,” said the civic group’s man­ager Woo Samyeol.</p>
