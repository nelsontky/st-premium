    <p>Ap­pointed head hon­cho of Tag Heuer in July, 25-year-old Frederic Ar­nault is prob­a­bly the youngest chief ex­ec­u­tive in Swiss lux­ury watch­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>De­trac­tors will un­doubt­edly say he is there be­cause his fa­ther is Mr Bernard Ar­nault, the bil­lion­aire boss of lux­ury con­glom­er­ate LVMH, which owns Tag and three other watch brands – Hublot, Zenith and Bvl­gari.</p>
    <p>But the young French­man will have you know he has been work­ing at the com­pany for three years.</p>
    <p>Be­fore tak­ing over the reins from Mr Stephane Bianchi, the 55-yearold pres­i­dent of LVMH’s watch divi­sion, he was Tag’s head of strat­egy and dig­i­tal over­see­ing the Con­nected Watch, the brand’s smart time­piece.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been tak­ing risks on key projects... and learn­ing a lot about the in­dus­try,” he says in an in­ter­view over Zoom from Geneva.</p>
    <p>Any­way, the 160-year-old com­pany has his­tor­i­cally been run by quite young CEOs, he says.</p>
    <p>“Edouard Heuer was 20 when he founded the brand. And mem­bers of the Heuer fam­ily, who man­aged the brand for a cen­tury, were all be­tween 20 and 27 when they be­came CEO,” says Mr Frederic Ar­nault, who has a de­gree in ap­plied math­e­mat­ics and com­puter science from Ecole Polytech­nique, one of France’s top ter­tiary in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>His work, he says, is cut out for him.</p>
    <p>He wants to en­er­gise the brand, kick off in­no­va­tion not just tech­ni­cally, but also cre­atively, spear­head kick-a** com­mu­ni­ca­tion cam­paigns and ini­ti­ate ex­cit­ing col­lab­o­ra­tions with artists and other cre­atives.</p>
    <p>“Our pri­or­ity is re­ally on tra­di­tional watches – it is our core busi­ness and what we live for. I think it is very im­por­tant to build icons and re­ally work on iconic prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>“We have the chance with prod­ucts that are 50, 60 years old and it’s im­por­tant to con­tinue to build on that, al­ways mod­ernising and giv­ing them a new twist.</p>
    <p>“That’s what we did with the Car­rera, which is the main aim of the brand this year,” he says.</p>
    <p>This year, the brand launched four limited-edi­tion Car­rera watches and two new Car­rera col­lec­tions – the Car­rera Sport Chrono­graph and Car­rera Chrono­graph.</p>
    <p>The watches are tributes to a time­piece – one of the in­dus­try’s most iconic – which was first launched in 1963.</p>
    <p>But Mr Ar­nault is also de­vot­ing a lot of his en­er­gies to the brand’s Con­nected Watch, which saw its third it­er­a­tion this year. Tag is the first Swiss lux­ury watch­maker to de­velop its own smart­watch.</p>
    <p>“The Con­nected Watch is very im­por­tant for us and we are go­ing to build it as a key pil­lar for the brand. It is per­form­ing very well this year, even though we launched it just be­fore the global lock­down.</p>
    <p>“We are in­vest­ing a lot, not only on the de­sign, but also on the func­tion­al­i­ties and user ex­pe­ri­ence. We have our own ecosys­tem we’re build­ing and mainly in the sports arena,” he says, re­fer­ring to the watch’s sports app, which boasts key met­rics in­clud­ing speed, dis­tance, heart rate and pace dis­played in real time for golf, run­ning, cy­cling, walk­ing and other sports.</p>
    <p>The rea­son, he adds, is sim­ple – “pure ad­di­tional busi­ness”.</p>
    <p>“It’s new con­sumers for the brand and also new con­sumers for the watch in­dus­try. We have a lot of cus­tomers who pur­chased this watch who didn’t have a watch be­fore, so that’s why I’m say­ing tra­di­tional watches are re­ally our core fo­cus.”</p>
    <p>He is philo­soph­i­cal when asked what it felt like to take on a busi­ness at a time when the world is fac­ing one of its great­est crises: Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“It’s a cri­sis that has af­fected the whole in­dus­try and has a strong im­pact on our busi­ness,” he ad­mits.</p>
    <p>“But it hasn’t dam­aged the brand’s eq­uity,” he adds, point­ing to pos­i­tive signs of lo­cal con­sump­tion in places like South-east Asia and China.</p>
    <p>“The de­sire to pur­chase watches is still su­per strong and will come back and be even stronger in the fu­ture to what it was. So we’re spend­ing a lot of time on the brand. That’s what’s re­ally im­por­tant.”</p>
