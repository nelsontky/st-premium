    <p>• Walt Dis­ney on Thurs­day post­poned the de­but of its movie Mu­lan in­def­i­nitely, deal­ing a new blow to theatre op­er­a­tors that were count­ing on the live­ac­tion epic to help at­tract au­di­ences dur­ing a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mu­lan was sched­uled to reach the­atres in March, but its re­lease has been post­poned sev­eral times as many cin­e­mas re­main closed.</p>
    <p>The film was most re­cently set to de­but on Aug 21 and cin­ema op­er­a­tors had hoped it would help spark a late-sum­mer re­bound in moviego­ing.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney also said it had de­layed the next film in­stal­ments from two of its big­gest fran­chises, Avatar and Star Wars, by one year as the novel coro­n­avirus has dis­rupted pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>The Avatar se­quel is now set to de­but i n the­atres i n De­cem­ber 2022 and the next Star Wars movie in De­cem­ber 2023.</p>
    <p>“It’s be­come clear that noth­ing can be set in stone when it comes to how we re­lease films dur­ing this global health cri­sis,” a Dis­ney rep­re­sen­ta­tive said.</p>
    <p>“To­day, that means paus­ing our re­lease plans for Mu­lan as we as­sess how we can most ef­fec­tively bring this film to au­di­ences around the world.”</p>
    <p>The Mu­lan de­lay fol­lows Warner Bros’ de­ci­sion to post­pone the Au­gust re­lease of the Christo­pher Nolan thriller, Tenet. The two films were seen as cin­e­mas’ best chance to sal­vage part of the lu­cra­tive sum­mer sea­son.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Sony Pic­tures will de­lay the se­quel to Spi­der-Man: Far From Home by one month to Dec 17, 2021, re­ported en­ter­tain­ment news out­let Va­ri­ety.</p>
    <p>The AMC and Cineworld movie theatre chains on Thurs­day pushed back the re­open­ing date for their United States the­atres to at least mid-Au­gust from the end of the month.</p>
    <p>The Avatar de­lay re­moves one of next year’s big­gest movies.</p>
    <p>The fol­low-up to James Cameron’s 2009 blockbuste­r – the sec­ond high­est-gross­ing film of all time – Avatar 2 had faced nu­mer­ous de­lays even be­fore the coro­n­avirus out­break. At one time, it had been ex­pected to reach the­atres in 2014.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney has not re­leased de­tails on the next Star Wars film.</p>
