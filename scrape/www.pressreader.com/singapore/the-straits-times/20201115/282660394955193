    <p>The James Bond movie made it look cool by hav­ing an as­sas­sin who used a golden gun with only gold bul­lets. The killer was por­trayed as a very dan­ger­ous man be­cause he could shoot faster and more ac­cu­rately than other gun­men.</p>
    <p>Other movies also por­trayed peo­ple lug­ging brief­cases or bags con­tain­ing big bars of gold as they made quick get­aways. In scenes of bank rob­beries, the cul­prits were of­ten shown putting bars of gold into black can­vas bags.</p>
    <p>Then there is the clas­sic, The Ital­ian Job, in which three small cars were used to ferry al­most half a tonne of gold each dur­ing a heist.</p>
    <p>In re­al­ity, all that glitters in the movies is not gold be­cause none of these tasks would be pos­si­ble if real gold was in­volved.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause gold is one of the dens­est met­als on earth and it is heav­ier than it looks.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, sil­ver is al­most half the den­sity of gold and thus it would take twice the amount of gold to fill the same space with the same amount of sil­ver.</p>
    <p>Mr Vic­tor Foo of gold trad­ing plat­form Sin­ga­pore Pre­cious Met­als Ex­change (SGPMX) says: “A small gold wafer may be easy to steal. How­ever, when it comes to a large quan­tity, phys­i­cally car­ry­ing it is im­pos­si­ble. In The Ital­ian Job, they used Mi­nis to carry mas­sive amounts of gold. If the heist were real, ex­ten­sive mod­i­fi­ca­tions to the chas­sis, sus­pen­sion and en­gine would be needed, as well as highly skilled driv­ers.”</p>
    <p>Most gold bul­lion from re­finer­ies is packed in boxes con­tain­ing 25 1kg bars. These boxes are no big­ger than boxes of choco­lates or bis­cuits. But it takes a lot of ef­fort to lift each box.</p>
    <p>Imag­ine try­ing to carry around your large check-in lug­gage, stuffed to the brim by the end of your hol­i­day, in the palms of your two hands. So it is quite im­pos­si­ble to ca­su­ally lug around a bag full of gold – even if the base of the bag does not give way first.</p>
    <p>Ow­ing to their small sizes, it is phys­i­cally pos­si­ble to put three boxes of gold bul­lion into a hardy brief­case. But lug­ging it around would be a dif­fer­ent story – un­less you can carry 75kg, or about the weight of an av­er­age built man, with one hand.</p>
    <p>For those who have to ex­am­ine a lot of gold bars, there is the con­stant worry that the ta­ble on which the work is done will col­lapse if too many bars are in­ad­ver­tently placed there at the same time.</p>
    <p>At SGPMX, the ta­bles are spe­cially struc­tured with re­in­forced steel be­cause em­ploy­ees rou­tinely place boxes of gold on them for in­spec­tion checks when­ever a ship­ment from a re­fin­ery comes in.</p>
    <p>So now you know why the man with the golden gun in the James Bond movie lost – if he truly used pure gold for his gun, the weight of his gun would have slowed him down in a quick draw.</p>
