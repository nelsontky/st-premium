    <p>Three events this week showed that the Covid-19 pan­demic has not de­railed the global fight against cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>If any­thing, it seems to have in­ten­si­fied the fo­cus of gov­ern­ments and in­vestors on the need to has­ten the switch to cleaner en­ergy sources for in­dus­tries, homes and trans­port.</p>
    <p>This was clear dur­ing the an­nual Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week (SIEW) this week which, de­spite the pan­demic, drew a large au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>The con­fer­ence, the first in the Repub­lic to use pre-event Covid-19 swab­bing, at­tracted up to 250 par­tic­i­pants at the Sands Expo and Con­ven­tion Cen­tre, 300 speak­ers in-per­son and vir­tu­ally, more than 30 min­is­ters and 20,000 on­line view­ers from more than 80 coun­tries, said an En­ergy Mar­ket Au­thor­ity (EMA) spokesman.</p>
    <p>The event, which opened on Mon­day, ended yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Over the five days, the clear mes­sage was that green in­dus­tries can be an en­gine of post-pan­demic re­cov­ery and good for the planet.</p>
    <p>Switch­ing from fos­sil fuel-pow­ered economies to wind, so­lar, bat­tery stor­age and even­tu­ally hy­dro­gen will not only cut planet-warm­ing green­house gas emis­sions, but also cre­ate new in­dus­tries and new jobs, as well as im­prove air qual­ity. What’s more, much of the tech­nol­ogy is af­ford­able.</p>
    <p>In a boost to SIEW, Ja­pan’s Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga on Mon­day set 2050 as the tar­get for the coun­try to be car­bon neu­tral.</p>
    <p>Two days later, South Korean Pres­i­dent Moon Jae-in made the same pledge.</p>
    <p>Last month, China’s Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping set 2060 as the tar­get for the coun­try, the world’s top car­bon pol­luter, to be car­bon neu­tral.</p>
    <p>The pledges from some of the world’s top economies her­ald a grow­ing global shift to­wards cleaner en­ergy.</p>
    <p>“The mes­sage of the en­ergy tran­si­tion need­ing to be green is very timely,” Mr Frank Phuan, chief ex­ec­u­tive and ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of Sin­ga­pore clean en­ergy firm Sun­seap, told The Straits Times, when asked about this year’s SIEW.</p>
    <p>He said: “I al­ways think that Covid-19 is like a drown­ing man but cli­mate change is a tsunami on the hori­zon. If any­thing, the pan­demic has made us more aware of dis­rup­tions, sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions, en­ergy in­de­pen­dence, or the ‘what ifs’, the black swan events. I think it makes us re­alise that sus­tain­abil­ity is an even more im­por­tant topic now.”</p>
    <p>South-east Asia is a grow­ing eco­nomic cen­tre and has huge en­ergy de­mands. Elec­tric­ity con­sump­tion in the re­gion is ex­pected to dou­ble in the next 20 years, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Agency (IEA).</p>
    <p>The fo­cus is meet­ing those de­mands with green, not black, en­ergy, and build­ing re­gional grids.</p>
    <p>In­creas­ingly, ma­jor in­vestors such as pen­sion funds are look­ing to in­vest in green en­ergy projects in the re­gion. The fi­nanc­ing is there and, in­creas­ingly, Sin­ga­pore is re­garded as a re­gional hub, but it still needs to quickly build ex­per­tise lo­cally in the re­new­able en­ergy sec­tor, car­bon ser­vices and green build­ings.</p>
    <p>Big green in­vest­ments are good for jobs, SIEW heard.</p>
    <p>“Each US$1 mil­lion (S$1.36 mil­lion) in­vested in re­new­ables in en­ergy trans­for­ma­tion will cre­ate 25 jobs. The same in­vest­ment will cre­ate 10 jobs in en­ergy ef­fi­ciency – three times more than the tra­di­tional con­ven­tional fos­sil fuel plant in­vest­ments,” Mr Francesco La Cam­era, di­rec­tor-gen­eral of the In­ter­na­tional Re­new­able En­ergy Agency, told SIEW.</p>
    <p>He said net gains in terms of jobs would be high­est in South-east Asia and sub-Sa­ha­ran Africa.</p>
    <p>Dr Fatih Birol, ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the IEA, said that while fos­sil fuel in­vest­ment has suf­fered dur­ing the pan­demic, re­new­ables has fared much bet­ter and de­mand is set to ac­cel­er­ate.</p>
    <p>“In the next 10 years, more than 80 per cent of the growth in global elec­tric­ity de­mand will be met by re­new­able en­ergy,” he said from Paris.</p>
    <p>Re­flect­ing the rapidly chang­ing en­ergy land­scape, the Sin­ga­pore Govern­ment an­nounced this week a so­lar en­ergy tar­get of 1.5 gi­gawatt-peak by 2025, al­most four times the cur­rent so­lar us­age of 390 megawatt-peak (MWp).</p>
    <p>Mr Phuan said that achiev­ing this could lead to the cre­ation of hun­dreds of new jobs.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing SIEW, mem­o­ran­dums of un­der­stand­ing were also signed – in­clud­ing one be­tween Sin­ga­pore and Aus­tralia on co­op­er­a­tion on low-emis­sions so­lu­tions such as hy­dro­gen and re­new­able en­ergy trade.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment also an­nounced a plan to im­port 100MW of elec­tric­ity from Malaysia over a trial pe­riod of two years, us­ing an ex­ist­ing in­ter­con­nec­tor. The EMA will is­sue a re­quest for a pro­posal by March next year, with a pref­er­ence for green en­ergy.</p>
    <p>As in­vest­ments in green en­ergy grow in the re­gion, along with en­ergy de­mand, the need to di­ver­sify grids will grow as well.</p>
    <p>This should help Sin­ga­pore bring in green power from other Asean states, or even Aus­tralia, in the not too dis­tant fu­ture.</p>
