    <p>I re­fer to the re­cent dis­cus­sion on maids tak­ing on care­giv­ing du­ties (Do­mes­tic workers car­ing for the el­derly over­worked, lack sup­port in Sin­ga­pore: Re­port, ST On­line, Nov 11; Time to see and value care­giv­ing as a pro­fes­sion; and Maids can­not be trained to be su­per­hu­mans, both Nov 14).</p>
    <p>Not all el­derly peo­ple are bedrid­den or so in­ca­pac­i­tated that they need pro­fes­sional care­givers. Some just need an ex­tra pair of hands to help out with do­mes­tic chores which they may find de­mand­ing.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, when my fam­ily first hired a maid for my aged par­ents, it was to re­lieve them of do­mes­tic chores. How­ever, over six or seven years, their health de­te­ri­o­rated to the ex­tent that we con­sid­ered get­ting one more maid or pro­fes­sional care­givers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, by then, both par­ents had be­come at­tached to the maid. The maid, too, was very at­tached to them.</p>
    <p>Switch­ing from maid to pro­fes­sional care­giver was thus not as easy as we ex­pected.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, a live-in trained care­giver’s main re­spon­si­bil­ity is the well-be­ing of the aged per­son in her care. General house­hold chores may be out­side her job scope.</p>
    <p>A house­hold with two aged par­ents or grand­par­ents re­quir­ing two care­givers and prob­a­bly a live-in maid for house­hold chores might find the costs pro­hib­i­tive. Not to men­tion pro­vid­ing suf­fi­cient, com­fort­able rest ar­eas or bed­rooms for them.</p>
    <p>My sib­lings and I also con­sid­ered the op­tion of nurs­ing homes, but such homes can also be costly. And the el­derly may also wish to live and die at home.</p>
    <p>My con­clu­sion, there­fore, is that many fac­tors have to be con­sid­ered in plan­ning for the care of one’s el­derly rel­a­tives, and while em­ploy­ing a maid may not be the best way to meet their needs, it may be the most vi­able one, given one’s con­straints.</p>
    <p>What is per­haps more im­por­tant is to pro­vide ad­e­quate sup­port for the maid, in terms of ask­ing about her well-be­ing and not just that of the old folks, and also be­ing eas­ily con­tactable in case of emer­gency, to re­duce the maid’s stress in what is a highly stress­ful and de­mand­ing job.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Some se&#xAD;niors may find switch&#xAD;ing from maid to pro&#xAD;fes&#xAD;sional care&#xAD;giver not easy as they may have grown at&#xAD;tached to the maid, and the maid to them. That was the writer&#x2019;s ex&#xAD;pe&#xAD;ri&#xAD;ence with her aged par&#xAD;ents.</p>
