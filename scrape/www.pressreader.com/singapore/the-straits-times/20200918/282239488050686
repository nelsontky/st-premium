    <p>NEW YORK • It still sur­prises many peo­ple that pro­fes­sional video-game tour­na­ments fill 50,000-seat are­nas and that mil­lions of fans watch from their bed­rooms, as­pir­ing to com­pete them­selves one day.</p>
    <p>What has not passed some en­trepreneur­s by, how­ever, is that this is qui­etly fu­elling a big mar­ket op­por­tu­nity around the world. Am­a­teur teams are spring­ing up spe­cial­is­ing i n e-sports games such as League of Leg­ends, Coun­terStrike and Dota 2, and they want places to meet and com­pete.</p>
    <p>Vacancies in Amer­i­can city cen­tres cre­ated by the shift to on­line shop­ping and mag­ni­fied by the Covid-19 pan­demic are per­fectly placed to fill the gap, said sev­eral ex­ec­u­tives.</p>
    <p>Simplicity Esports has about 40 gam­ing cen­tres in 15 US states, which let am­a­teurs meet and play to­gether on high-end com­put­ers with­out wor­ry­ing about cheats or slow net­work con­nec­tions.</p>
    <p>Its pres­i­dent, Ro­man Franklin, said that since Jan­uary, he has seen a 40 to 70 per cent im­prove­ment in lease terms for po­ten­tial new venues. At some lo­ca­tions, the com­pany has se­cured flex­i­ble rents rep­re­sent­ing 10 per cent of the sites’ gross sales, with no min­i­mum rent and ad­di­tional costs.</p>
    <p>Nas­daq-listed Al­lied Esports En­ter­tain­ment Inc. is plan­ning to build ad­di­tional venues mod­elled on its flag­ship e-sports hub.</p>
    <p>Built in­side The Luxor in Las Ve­gas, the 9,146 sq m HyperX Esports Arena opened in 2018 and is kit­ted out with gam­ing PCs and con­soles loaded with a va­ri­ety of e-sports ti­tles. It also hosts weekly tour­na­ments and events.</p>
    <p>Af­ter start­ing with are­nas in China and mo­bile gam­ing cen­tres mounted on 18-wheeler trucks, Al­lied Esports brought in real es­tate giants Brook­field and Si­mon Prop­erty Group Inc. as share­hold­ers to fur­ther ex­pand its bricks-and­mor­tar busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Af­ter paus­ing work due to the pan­demic, Al­lied Esports chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Jud Han­ni­gan is wait­ing for the right mo­ment to re­sume devel­op­ment of three sites.</p>
    <p>“The in­dus­try is ob­vi­ously go­ing through a dif­fi­cult patch here,” he said, but added that “we be­lieve in malls suc­cess­fully mov­ing to be ex­pe­ri­ence desti­na­tions, not just re­tail desti­na­tions”.</p>
    <p>Am­a­teur Fort­nite or League of Leg­ends fa­nat­ics in­spired by high­pro­file gamers – such as 16-yearold Kyle “Bugha” Giers­dorf, who won US$3 mil­lion (S$4.1 mil­lion) in last year’s Fort­nite World Cup fi­nal – want to prac­tise and com­pete in en­vi­ron­ments where no one can gain a tech­ni­cal ad­van­tage and it is harder to cheat.</p>
    <p>“Play­ing from home is like play­ing bas­ket­ball in your drive­way – the hoop may not be 10 feet high and the drive­way might be a bit sloped at the front,” said Zack John­son, CEO of e-sports ser­vices com­pany GGCir­cuit, which de­vel­ops and sells cloud-based soft­ware used by about 1,000 e-sports cen­tres around the world.</p>
    <p>In­dus­try ex­ec­u­tives say lock­downs de­layed bricks-and-mor­tar ex­pan­sion plans, but John­son said more than half of the 20,000 screens that run on its equip­ment are now back on­line.</p>
    <p>Venues were ap­pear­ing across Eu­rope be­fore the pan­demic too, led by a crop of young com­pa­nies such as France’s Team Vi­tal­ity and Melt­down, Swe­den’s Space, and Lon­don-based Game Dig­i­tal’s Be­long net­work.</p>
    <p>Kin­guin runs a 6,560 sq ft boot­camp-ho­tel for pro­fes­sional teams in War­saw. It is now go­ing af­ter the am­a­teur mar­ket and opened an Esports Lounge in the port city of Gdansk in June.</p>
    <p>Even tra­di­tional sports stars are no stranger to the po­ten­tial: Guild Esports, part-owned by English foot­ball great David Beck­ham, last week an­nounced plans for an ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing that will help fund a train­ing acad­emy and scout­ing net­work.</p>
