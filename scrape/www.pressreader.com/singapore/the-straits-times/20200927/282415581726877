    <p>Lo­cally, we have the woke Kheng sib­lings, Narelle and Ben­jamin, us­ing their in­flu­encer sta­tus to pro­mote men­tal health and sus­tain­abil­ity, along with their mu­sic and act­ing ca­reers.</p>
    <p>We have Sin­ga­porean chil­dren as young as age 11 com­plet­ing Grade Eight pi­ano prac­ti­cal qual­i­fi­ca­tions, while the typ­i­cal age is 16.</p>
    <p>In Bri­tain, my 17-year-old daugh­ter Happy’s school­mate, Ruby, at age 13, spoke at the United Na­tions, cam­paign­ing to end Pe­riod Poverty, where girls and women do not have ac­cess to safe, hy­gienic men­strual prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Malala Yousafzai, at 17, be­came the youngest No­bel Prize win­ner in 2014. Two years prior, the Tale­ban tried to as­sas­si­nate her on the school bus be­cause she blogged of its grow­ing in­flu­ence in Pak­istan. Malala sur­vived the tragedy and con­tin­ues to ad­vo­cate for girls’ rights.</p>
    <p>There is 16-year-old Charli D’Ame­lio, TikTok’s most fol­lowed per­son with more than 88 mil­lion fol­low­ers, earn­ing US$50,000 (S$68,890) a paid post on the lip-sync­ing app, whop­ping up</p>
    <p>US$4 mil­lion in the last year.</p>
    <p>More than ever, peo­ple are ex­tra­or­di­nary and nearly all of us, at ev­ery age, want to be ex­cep­tional ex­cep­tions. This univer­sal fer­vour has us lust­ing to be smarter, bet­ter-look­ing, richer, more fa­mous than oth­ers. The more driven we are, the more we de­sire to stand out, to be any­thing but or­di­nary. For an or­di­nary life feels just wrong.</p>
    <p>Per­haps par­ents are to blame: We do spend our chil­dren’s de­vel­op­men­tal years telling them how ut­terly in­cred­i­ble they are.</p>
    <p>In some vari­a­tion, we were all told, “If you work hard, then you will achieve your goal”, although we recog­nise few will be­come rocket sci­en­tists, fa­mous ac­tresses, Olympians or prime min­is­ters, no mat­ter how hard we per­se­vere.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy, so­cial me­dia specif­i­cally, is among the salves feed­ing this “ex­tra­or­di­nary” frenzy. Ev­ery­one wants a piece of the pie.</p>
    <p>YouTube claims 31 mil­lion chan­nels. More than 160,000 of those have 100,000 sub­scribers or more, while 16,000 YouTube chan­nels have over one mil­lion fol­low­ers.</p>
    <p>TikTok, world­wide, claims 800 mil­lion ac­tive users and In­sta­gram in Sin­ga­pore has 2.1 mil­lion users. That is 34.4 per cent of the pop­u­la­tion, with 40 per cent be­tween 25 and 34 years old, un­doubt­edly an ad­ver­tiser’s dream de­mo­graphic.</p>
    <p>We will­ingly drink the Kool-Aid of advertiser­s who con­vince us their prod­ucts will make us pret­tier, more fash­ion­able, smarter, less or­di­nary. We are all about self-ex­pres­sion, fol­low­ing dreams, pro­mot­ing a utopian life, made all the love­lier with the lat­est fil­ter, en­hanc­ing our “per­fec­tion” for so­cial me­dia feeds. Our nor­mal has us aim­ing to at­tract more fol­low­ers to ap­pre­ci­ate said spe­cial­ness.</p>
    <p>Striv­ing for sub­scribers and “likes”, we are ad­dicted to the adren­a­line rush brought on by our end­less self-pro­mo­tion.</p>
    <p>The praise trig­gers our neu­ro­trans­mit­ter dopamine, which I now know is in­volved in most ad­dic­tive be­hav­iours. As a re­sult, so­cial me­dia keeps us ob­sessed, al­beit mis­er­able, yet keen to re­turn and check, again and again, for another like.</p>
    <p>I blame the “Cult of Me” cul­ture on the Kardashian­s, who have fas­ci­nated the world since 2007. From their re­al­ity tele­vi­sion show, Keep­ing Up With The Kardashian­s, we have wit­nessed how truly spe­cial they are. Af­ter the an­nounce­ment that the show will con­clude with the 2021 sea­son, we need not worry.</p>
    <p>The re­sult­ing re­al­ity TV shows – hun­dreds of them, since their low pro­duc­tion costs bring high rev­enue re­turns for the net­works – will con­tinue to show nor­mal folks how un-spe­cial and run-of-the-mill we are.</p>
    <p>So, we keep as­pir­ing to stand out, to be su­per­stars, be­cause we are all ex­tra­or­di­nary. But maybe, the time is nigh for us to re­turn to that bril­liant book we all read as chil­dren, Oh, The Places You’ll Go! by</p>
    <p>Dr Seuss.</p>
    <p>Re­call the lines: “Wher­ever you fly, you’ll be the best of the best. Wher­ever you go, you will top all the rest.”</p>
    <p>Sounds good, right? But wait, we know what is about to drop: “Ex­cept, when you don’t. Be­cause, some­times, you won’t.”</p>
    <p>We can­not al­ways be the best, faster than the rest, smarter than the smartest and strong­est in the pack. Why can we not ac­cept that most of us are plain old or­di­nary? Av­er­age. And there is ab­so­lutely noth­ing wrong with this.</p>
    <p>We learn to walk, talk, eat, drive and work, pro­ceed­ing through life with fam­ily, friends and com­mu­nity as our fo­cus. Only a few will visit the moon or dis­cover the cure for can­cer.</p>
    <p>The never-end­ing de­sire for more, bet­ter spe­cial­ness does not bring us con­tent­ment but, in­stead, a se­rial state of un­hap­pi­ness and dis­sat­is­fac­tion. Liv­ing the un­re­al­is­tic dream of how ex­tra­or­di­nary we are leads to a gen­uine sense of in­ad­e­quacy.</p>
    <p>Since our so­ci­ety val­ues and re­wards over­work­ing, step­ping away from the mad­ness, the spot­light or the slog of self-pro­mo­tion is dif­fi­cult. The prom­ise of a po­ten­tial pay­off from over­work­ing, con­vinc­ing our­selves we are spe­cial, has us do­ing all kinds of crazy hours, con­sumed with get­ting ahead, re­ceiv­ing another pro­mo­tion, buy­ing a bet­ter car or condo, only to re­ceive a di­vorce let­ter from our spouse.</p>
    <p>How many chil­dren’s awards cer­e­monies and track meets, even wed­ding an­niver­saries, can we miss be­fore re­al­is­ing where the true pri­or­i­ties lie in a mean­ing­ful life?</p>
    <p>For those mar­ried to ca­reers, we learn of­ten too late, with fail­ing men­tal health, that per­sonal re­la­tion­ships are far more ful­fill­ing than pro­fes­sional ones.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, The At­lantic mag­a­zine stud­ied “suc­cess ad­dicts”, where peo­ple value be­ing spe­cial over be­ing happy. This is a real thing. We are ad­dicted to suc­cess. Peo­ple will­ingly al­low them­selves to suf­fer phys­i­cally and men­tally, work­ing too long, too hard, pur­su­ing that de­sired suc­cess.</p>
    <p>But one can walk away. Look at chef An­dre Chi­ang. The day be­fore he closed his two-Miche­lin-starred Restau­rant An­dre here in 2018, he said: “This can’t be all that I can do.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter eight years, he wanted more, so he left his ex­tra­or­di­nary life – a chef with two stars is ex­tra­or­di­nary – to re­turn home to Tai­wan, fo­cus­ing in­stead on what he deemed im­por­tant ver­sus gain­ing that third Miche­lin star.</p>
    <p>He, though, may be truly ex­tra­or­di­nary, since his Taipei restau­rant RAW re­ceived two stars last month, for the sec­ond con­sec­u­tive year. My hus­band Jim says: “It’s be­cause chef An­dre is happy. When one is happy, he does not need more.”</p>
    <p>I want to be­lieve this, but I think most of us are con­sumed with suc­cess and, thus, not sat­is­fied.</p>
    <p>Thank­fully, the cir­cuit breaker did open some eyes. We found con­tent­ment in the “lit­tle things”: spend­ing time with fam­ily, bak­ing to­gether, en­joy­ing walks and, in my house, com­plet­ing te­dious yet re­ward­ing, old-fash­ioned jig­saw puz­zles.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic al­lowed time to pause, re­flect and re­con­sider hap­pi­ness. With per­spec­tive, I have come to un­der­stand that it is per­fectly ac­cept­able to be ex­tra­or­di­nary in a small way, in our own lives, with those who mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Since I was a lit­tle girl, I wanted to leave my small home town in the United States. Now, I recog­nise that deep-seated de­sire to “es­cape”, to be where I was not, was more about not let­ting life elude me.</p>
    <p>Once I moved to New York City, then trav­elled the world with Jim, this or­di­nary girl from Rocky Mount, North Carolina, be­came kind of ex­tra­or­di­nary, earn­ing a Guin­ness World Record for cir­cum­nav­i­gat­ing the globe, vis­it­ing 116 coun­tries.</p>
    <p>That ad­ven­ture led us to move from New York to Sin­ga­pore be­cause we be­lieved Asia was the fu­ture. We wanted our chil­dren to grow up here, speak­ing Man­darin. Both Jim and I were con­scious of of­fer­ing them an X-fac­tor, an abil­ity that might make them ex­tra­or­di­nary, set­ting them apart in such a com­pet­i­tive world.</p>
    <p>The irony is that Happy, as she pre­pares ap­pli­ca­tions for univer­si­ties, wants to at­tend schools only in the US. She feels Jim and I have stripped her of her Amer­i­can iden­tity by rear­ing her on the other side of the world. “I want to know who I am, where I come from, mother,” she says.</p>
    <p>Now, she sim­ply wants to be an or­di­nary girl. As a mother, I won­der if I should have given Happy and her sis­ter Bee, 12, a more con­ven­tional life. One where they of­ten vis­ited their grand­par­ents, cousins, aunts and un­cles, as I did as a child.</p>
    <p>Of late, I pon­der if Jim and I made the cor­rect de­ci­sion leav­ing the US to make our home here some 13 years ago.</p>
    <p>My gut says Sin­ga­pore is home, but I have known both worlds. Happy now seeks to know her other home. That makes com­plete sense. Maybe she is a lit­tle bit ex­tra­or­di­nary, while I re­main con­tent in my role as an or­di­nary mum, like most, want­ing only the best for my chil­dren.</p>
