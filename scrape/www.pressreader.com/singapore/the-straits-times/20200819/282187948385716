    <p>Bigo Tech­nol­ogy, a smaller ri­val of em­bat­tled Chi­nese app-maker ByteDance, is shift­ing servers from Hong Kong to Sin­ga­pore, out of the reach of a new na­tional se­cu­rity law at a time when it is seek­ing to em­pha­sise in­de­pen­dence from its Chi­nese par­ent.</p>
    <p>The move, which fol­lows In­dia’s ban on the firm’s apps dur­ing this year’s flare-up in hos­til­i­ties be­tween New Delhi and Bei­jing, comes as the United States tough­ens scrutiny of Chi­nese-owned firms.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has said the US could ex­ert more pres­sure on China-owned com­pa­nies after threat­en­ing to ban ByteDance’s pop­u­lar short-video app TikTok over con­cerns about the safety of the per­sonal data it han­dles.</p>
    <p>Bigo, whose equiv­a­lent app Li­kee and live-stream­ing app Bigo Live com­pete with TikTok, has not been named by the US au­thor­i­ties, but a se­nior of­fi­cial of the firm told Reuters it hoped “not to be caught in the cross­fire”.</p>
    <p>“The un­for­tu­nate thing is some­times we can’t con­trol what other peo­ple think,” Mr Mike Ong, vi­cepres­i­dent of gov­ern­ment re­la­tions, said in the firm’s head­quar­ters in the city state, where it was founded in 2014.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said the firm runs “to­tally in­de­pen­dently” of Joyy, a US-listed Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy firm that bought it last year in a deal valu­ing Bigo at US$2.1 bil­lion (S$2.9 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>Bigo is an ab­bre­vi­a­tion of “Be­fore I Get Old”. Joyy’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, Chi­nese na­tional David Li, is a co­founder and chair­man of both firms.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said Bigo does not pro­vide ser­vices in China, and has its own man­age­ment, re­sources and in­fra­struc­ture, in­clud­ing data cen­tres.</p>
    <p>With Hong Kong’s new na­tional se­cu­rity law giv­ing Bei­jing author­ity to demand that com­pa­nies turn over user data, Bigo, like other global tech firms, is moving its servers out of the semi-au­tonomous city.</p>
    <p>“There’s a cer­tain ap­pre­hen­sion with what’s go­ing on in Hong Kong,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>“To be safe, we have de­cided to make sure that we re­lo­cate them (the servers) to Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Bigo’s big­gest data cen­tre ca­pac­ity is in Sin­ga­pore, along with other mar­kets where it op­er­ates, such as In­dia, the US, Europe and the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>Still, de­spite its re­peated as­ser­tions of in­de­pen­dence and Sin­ga­pore ori­gins, In­dia banned it, along with some Chi­nese apps, in June as pre­sent­ing threats to its “sovereignt­y and in­tegrity”, after a bor­der clash with China.</p>
    <p>In­dia is among Bigo’s big­gest mar­kets and the base of more than one­fifth of its global staff of 5,000.</p>
    <p>Bigo said it has ap­pealed to the Sin­ga­pore and In­dian gov­ern­ments for help in the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is among the most pop­u­lar lo­ca­tions for Chi­nese firms look­ing to ex­pand over­seas, since eth­nic Chi­nese make up a ma­jor­ity of its pop­u­la­tion and Man­darin is widely spo­ken.</p>
    <p>But even there, Bigo’s sit­u­a­tion ex­em­pli­fies the grow­ing chal­lenges for firms in a world of in­creas­ingly po­larised tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>“The own­er­ship of a com­pany isn’t de­cided by where the head­quar­ters is, but who takes the ma­jor­ity share,” said an­a­lyst Wang Xiaofeng of re­search firm For­rester.</p>
    <p>If coun­tries were to ban apps based on pol­i­tics, com­pa­nies would have few op­tions even if they were sep­a­rate en­ti­ties from their par­ents with dif­fer­ent brands, she added.</p>
    <p>Asked if the com­pany was look­ing at list­ing Bigo, di­ver­si­fy­ing its own­er­ship or sell­ing its US busi­ness, Mr Ong said it was weigh­ing var­i­ous sce­nar­ios.</p>
    <p>As the pan­demic forces peo­ple to stay home, Bigo has be­come a ma­jor growth driver for par­ent Joyy.</p>
    <p>Bigo Live has seen growth of more than 30 per cent in monthly ac­tive users since the start of the year, with a cor­re­spond­ing fig­ure of 50 per cent for Li­kee.</p>
