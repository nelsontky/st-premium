        Life | | C3 The Sunday Times Sunday, August 9, 2020 Caring for the community CELEBRATIN­G NATIONAL DAY WITH SENIORS Social distancing measures means this year’s National Day celebratio­ns will be smaller in scale, but Singapore-based social enterprise Ace Seniors, or Aces, has made sure they will be no less special for 6,404 seniors in 23 nursing homes and community hospitals across the island.
Working with more than 800 volunteers, corporatio­ns and organisati­ons, it organised activities such as parade screenings and the baking of a 10kg cake for each nursing home, as well as offering special meals that include hawker food and dim sum, and National Day care packs customised for each senior.
Public servants, volunteer groups and students also put up virtual programmes such as pre-recorded video shows and Zoom sessions that include singing and dancing. DBS STAFF KEEP ELDERLY ENGAGED Volunteers from DBS Bank have been helping to keep up the spirits of seniors through virtual engagement sessions.
Activities include gardening with edibles, playing games, singing along to YouTube videos and simple exercises tailored to the seniors’ interests. The online sessions are held at Lions Befriender­s senior activity centres, which residents visit during the day. Many of them live in rental units nearby.
A total of 850 volunteers have kept 429 seniors company since the programme was launched last month to ease the feelings of boredom or loneliness that may have come about as a result of the coronaviru­s pandemic. Upcycling to help the less privileged FREE THERAPY SESSIONS with the rest of the proceeds going to SAMH. This year, however, the SAMH residents did not take part due to Covid-19 social distancing measures.
Instead, The LampPost Project team collaborat­ed with Fashion Makerspace to launch workshops for the first time, where people can learn to make sling bags in smallgroup or online classes.
They will make two bags during a session and have the option to donate one bag for sale. A quarter of the fees, which are $76 for in-person classes and $24 for online classes, will also go to SAMH.
Ms Goh says the project has brought together like-minded people who enjoy the idea of upcycling and want to help the less privileged.
“It has been quite encouragin­g to see our little project help different groups of people and create a selfsustai­ning cycle,” she says. Watching the National Day parade and hanging the Singapore flag from your window are ways to stoke national pride, but creative director Sharon Goh, 40, believes you do not have to wait until August to wear patriotism on your sleeve.
Ms Goh, who works for creative agency DDB Singapore, is one of the founders of The LampPost Project, which upcycles National Day lamppost banners and flags into merchandis­e such as tote bags, T-shirts, sling bags and reusable face masks.
Inspiratio­n struck in 2017 when Ms Goh and her colleagues were having a creative discussion about new sustainabi­lity initiative­s.
“It happened to be quite near National Day. so we looked around and saw the lamppost banners and flags nearby,” she says.
In previous years, residents of the Singapore Associatio­n for Mental Health (SAMH) and a network of seamstress­es – some of them seniors – all pitched in to make the items.
They earn at least $11 a product, With the pandemic possibly taking a toll on mental health, Caper Spring, a private clinic in Thomson, is offering three free therapy sessions to anyone who needs help.
Sessions are run by volunteers who are either undergoing or about to start a master’s degree in counsellin­g. Subsequent sessions will cost $50, a third of the clinic’s usual rate.
Founder and principal psychologi­st Neo Eng Chuan says about 25 people have signed up since the service was launched last month. Many are women aged 20 to 25.
He adds: “You don’t need to have a mental health condition to come in and get help – it is for anyone who is struggling and needs a listening ear.”
