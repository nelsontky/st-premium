    <p>•</p>
    <p>MON­TE­V­IDEO Last sea­son was a tur­bu­lent one for Arthur Melo. The 24-year-old breached La Liga coro­n­avirus pro­to­cols, was caught drink driv­ing and re­fused to take part in Barcelona’s Cham­pi­ons League prepa­ra­tions so as to force a trans­fer to Ju­ven­tus.</p>
    <p>His an­tics has­tened his €72 mil­lion (S$114.7 mil­lion) move to the Ital­ian cham­pi­ons in the sum­mer, with Mi­ralem Pjanic head­ing the other way but it also meant be­ing over­looked by Brazil coach Tite.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with Casemiro ab­sent after test­ing pos­i­tive for Covid-19 nearly two weeks ago, Arthur earned a re­call on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old mid­fielder marked his first Sele­cao ap­pear­ance of the year with his maiden in­ter­na­tional goal, set­ting Brazil on their way to a 2-0 World Cup qual­i­fy­ing vic­tory over Uruguay.</p>
    <p>Arthur’s opener was for­tu­nate as it took a de­flec­tion that wrong­footed Martin Cam­pana, but the stroke of luck helped ease the nerves of a side miss­ing free-scor­ing Ney­mar.</p>
    <p>Ever­ton for­ward Richarli­son added a se­cond on the stroke of half-time as the vis­i­tors in­flicted only the se­cond de­feat in 32 home games – both times by Brazil – for Uruguay, who could not call on Covid-hit Luis Suarez and had Edin­son Ca­vani sent off late on.</p>
    <p>While the hosts will count them­selves un­for­tu­nate after hit­ting the wood­work twice and hav­ing a goal dis­al­lowed, Tite’s men now have four wins in as many games, en­sur­ing they re­main on top of the stand­ings to qual­ify for Qatar 2022, while Uruguay are fifth.</p>
    <p>Arthur later claimed Brazil de­served the hard-fought win but urged his team­mates not to get cocky over their 100 per cent record. “There is al­ways room for im­prove­ment,” he said. “We are not get­ting ar­ro­gant be­cause we’re un­beaten.</p>
    <p>“We know that every game is dif­fi­cult and every game dif­fer­ent but we are on the right path. Not be­cause we’ve won but be­cause some­times, we’ve been play­ing well.</p>
    <p>“We are on the right path, we have to­tal faith in the coaches and they have faith in us and so we’ll keep look­ing to achieve our ob­jec­tive, which is to qual­ify for the World Cup fi­nals.</p>
    <p>“I think we were re­warded with the win be­cause we went after it more than they did.”</p>
    <p>Arch-ri­vals Ar­gentina also re­mained within touch­ing dis­tance after a 2-0 away win over Peru to leave them se­cond and two points be­hind Brazil (12).</p>
    <p>La Al­bice­leste were un­lucky not to score more in a dom­i­nant dis­play, with Stuttgart’s Ni­co­las Gon­za­lez and fel­low strike part­ner Lau­taro Martinez of In­ter Mi­lan get­ting on the score­sheet.</p>
    <p>Skip­per and Barcelona for­ward Lionel Messi was pleased with their in­ci­sive at­tack, say­ing: “From the very start, we played a great game, the goals came and we cre­ated lots of chances.</p>
    <p>“Happy with the vic­tory, we needed it after the game we played the other day (last week’s 1-1 home draw with Paraguay).”</p>
    <p>The South Amer­i­can World Cup qual­i­fiers re­sume next March.</p>
