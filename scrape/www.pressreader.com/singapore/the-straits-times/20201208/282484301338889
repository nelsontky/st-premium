    <p>The Asean Foot­ball Fed­er­a­tion (AFF) Suzuki Cup has been post­poned for a sec­ond time and will now take place from Dec 5 next year to Jan 1, 2022.</p>
    <p>The bi­en­nial tour­na­ment was orig­i­nally sched­uled for last month be­fore it was pushed back to April next year ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment yes­ter­day, the AFF said: “This de­ci­sion re­flects the con­tin­ued pri­or­ity of AFF which is the health and safety of ev­ery­one, and (it) has also been made to pro­vide greater cer­tainty to all of the event’s stake­hold­ers, in­clud­ing the AFF mem­ber as­so­ci­a­tions, teams, play­ers and of­fi­cials, com­mer­cial part­ners and fans.</p>
    <p>AFF pres­i­dent Khiev Sameth of Cam­bo­dia noted that De­cem­ber was ideal for the tour­na­ment as the foot­ball sched­ule next year will be crowded due to in­ter­na­tional and do­mes­tic events be­ing held over from this year.</p>
    <p>He said: “The new dates will pro­vide the best op­por­tu­nity for the event to be staged in its full for­mat with home and away fix­tures in both the group and knock­out stages, and with sta­di­ums filled with fans to en­cour­age and cel­e­brate their teams.”</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore na­tional team are the sec­ond most suc­cess­ful team in the com­pe­ti­tion’s his­tory with four ti­tles, one be­hind Thai­land. How­ever, the Li­ons have not made it past the group stage into the two-legged semi­fi­nals in the three edi­tions af­ter they last won the tour­na­ment in 2012.</p>
    <p>Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore pres­i­dent Lim Kia Tong said: “We sup­port the de­ci­sion to post­pone the tour­na­ment be­cause this al­lows more time for the pan­demic sit­u­a­tion to sta­bilise, and give the Li­ons more time to pre­pare and get back into the groove of things.”</p>
    <p>Li­ons for­ward Gabriel Quak added: “The Suzuki Cup is the big­gest tour­na­ment in the re­gion and we are all look­ing for­ward to play in it.</p>
    <p>“We can no longer take any­thing for granted in th­ese un­cer­tain times, and this post­pone­ment will give play­ers more op­por­tu­ni­ties to im­press the na­tional coach.”</p>
