    <p>The re­sump­tion of more se­nior-cen­tric ac­tiv­i­ties marks an im­por­tant step in the psy­cho­log­i­cal “re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion” of a group that is con­sid­er­ably vul­ner­a­ble to the spread of Covid-19. The el­derly, par­tic­u­larly those with un­der­ly­ing health con­di­tions – which is to be ex­pected among some of those who are aged – have been the sub­ject of na­tional at­ten­tion since the on­set of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. This has re­sulted in a con­trac­tion of the social space they used to en­joy, for their own good.</p>
    <p>How­ever, given that com­mu­nity in­fec­tion rates have re­mained low and sta­ble gen­er­ally, it is time to fo­cus again on the men­tal well-be­ing of se­niors. This is be­ing done in­cre­men­tally, with small group ac­tiv­i­ties of up to five peo­ple be­ing al­lowed to re­sume for se­nior-cen­tric pro­grammes or­gan­ised by the Peo­ple’s As­so­ci­a­tion, the Health Pro­mo­tion Board, Sport Sin­ga­pore and the Coun­cil for Third Age. Ex­am­ples of th­ese group ac­tiv­i­ties in­clude board games, class­room ac­tiv­i­ties and group ex­er­cise classes.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, ac­tiv­i­ties in such set­tings were lim­ited to those that could be car­ried out in­di­vid­u­ally. How­ever, singing classes will not be al­lowed still. Nat­u­rally, se­niors will have to abide by pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sures hav­ing to do with hy­giene, safe dis­tanc­ing, and stick­ing to a small and reg­u­lar cir­cle of con­tacts when go­ing out. Th­ese are sen­si­ble mea­sures to re­mind them that Covid-19 re­mains a real threat to Sin­ga­pore – and to them.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic has been a disas­ter around the world this year, af­fect­ing lives, liveli­hoods and social in­ter­ac­tions. Al­most ev­ery­one has paid the price in some way or the other. The el­derly in Sin­ga­pore might not have been bat­tered by Covid-19’s eco­nomic impact to the ex­tent borne by younger peo­ple fac­ing job losses, but the psy­cho­log­i­cal bur­den of iso­la­tion has been a dif­fi­cult one for them to bear. The lat­est move will make it eas­ier for them to rein­te­grate them­selves so­cially.</p>
