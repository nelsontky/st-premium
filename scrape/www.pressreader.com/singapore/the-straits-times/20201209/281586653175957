    <p>Sin­ga­pore is hot. But this does not mean noth­ing can be done about it. Lo­cal re­searchers keen to prove that the ef­fects of heat can be tamed have em­barked on a re­search project to study its im­pact on the health and work pro­duc­tiv­ity of those with more phys­i­cally in­ten­sive jobs, such as mi­grant workers and hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore is hot, hot, hot. But this does not mean noth­ing can be done about it.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal re­searchers keen to prove that the ef­fects of heat can be tamed have em­barked on a re­search project to study its im­pact on the health and work pro­duc­tiv­ity of those with more phys­i­cally in­ten­sive jobs here, such as mi­grant workers, sol­diers and hawk­ers.</p>
    <p>Named Project Heat-Safe, the three-year project will also iden­tify pol­icy changes that can be made and other ac­tions that can be taken to re­duce the im­pact of heat on these groups.</p>
    <p>The study, launched on Oct 1, in­volves re­searchers from the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS), Sin­ga­pore-ETH Cen­tre and for­eign coun­ter­parts from places such as Viet­nam, Cam­bo­dia and China. It is sup­ported by the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion of the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice.</p>
    <p>The project’s lead prin­ci­pal in­ves­ti­ga­tor, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Ja­son Lee, told The Straits Times on Mon­day that Sin­ga­pore sees about one heat-re­lated death ev­ery five years. But while this num­ber may seem small to some, he added that the main con­cern is of ac­ci­dents oc­cur­ring as a re­sult of heat stress.</p>
    <p>“When you are hot, you com­pro­mise your de­ci­sion mak­ing and, there­fore, ac­ci­dents do in­crease,” said Prof Lee, who is deputy direc­tor of the Hu­man Po­ten­tial Trans­la­tional Re­search Pro­gramme at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.</p>
    <p>So he and his fel­low re­searchers are try­ing to un­der­stand how heat may ad­versely af­fect those who spend long hours do­ing phys­i­cal labour and what can be done about it.</p>
    <p>Such a project will ben­e­fit not only man­ual labour­ers, but also the rest of the pop­u­la­tion, he said, even though many peo­ple may sim­ply take it for granted that Sin­ga­pore is nat­u­rally hot and they can­not do any­thing about it.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, he said: “We are so be­haviourall­y ad­justed to this sort of cli­mate that the price we pay is not a short-term one. We avoid ex­er­cise out­doors dur­ing a cer­tain win­dow of the day and, there­fore, we lose the op­por­tu­nity to keep our­selves fit.”</p>
    <p>This can later lead to other is­sues linked to a seden­tary life­style.</p>
    <p>But this mind­set is flawed, he added, as in­di­vid­u­als can re­spond to heat dif­fer­ently de­pend­ing on var­i­ous fac­tors, in­clud­ing the clothes they wear, the type of ex­er­cises they are en­gaged in and how they are con­di­tioned.</p>
    <p>Prof Lee said that this is the first project of its kind here to in­volve not just sci­en­tific per­spec­tives, but also eco­nomic and so­cial ones.</p>
    <p>“We are not just pro­duc­ing good sci­ence, but (try­ing) to change pol­icy. We want to go into the board­room and say that we know the prob­lem, this is our rec­om­men­da­tion: it will cost $1 mil­lion but you will reap $10 mil­lion, and there is no need to com­pro­mise be­tween health and pro­duc­tiv­ity be­cause you can achieve both,” he said.</p>
    <p>The project will in­volve a sur­vey of hourly heat lev­els in se­lected work en­vi­ron­ments across Sin­ga­pore, Viet­nam and Cam­bo­dia, and a study of the heat im­pacts on workers and their health and pro­duc­tiv­ity in the three coun­tries.</p>
    <p>It will also try to un­der­stand the in­di­vid­ual prac­tices of workers and how they at­tempt to man­age heat stress, and an­a­lyse the coun­try-level eco­nomic and well­be­ing im­pact of work pro­duc­tiv­ity loss due to heat, and com­pare it with the costs of heat preven­tion poli­cies and mea­sures.</p>
    <p>Project Heat-Safe will also ex­am­ine whether heat stress has an im­pact on fer­til­ity and preg­nancy out­comes in Sin­ga­pore, and the po­ten­tial im­pact of heat on ed­u­ca­tion and stu­dents’ abil­ity to fo­cus after ac­tiv­i­ties such as phys­i­cal ed­u­ca­tion classes.</p>
    <p>Prof Lee said: “I hope this project will cre­ate more aware­ness that the im­pact of heat stress is very sig­nif­i­cant in our con­text, where the loss of pro­duc­tiv­ity is some­thing that is un­seen.”</p>
    <p>HEAT INFLUENCES AC­TIONS</p>
    <p>We are so be­haviourall­y ad­justed to this sort of cli­mate that the price we pay is not a short-term one.</p>
