    <p>Unity and trust will be at the fore­front of the bat­tle for Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics’ top posts as the lo­cal track and field fra­ter­nity elects its new lead­ers on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>SA’s 23 af­fil­i­ates will de­cide just their fourth pres­i­dent in al­most four decades against a back­drop of le­gal is­sues and high-pro­file dis­putes that have dogged the sport in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Ath­let­ics’ hot seat will be filled for the next two years by ei­ther lawyer Ed­mond Pereira, a 70-yearold stal­wart of the lo­cal scene, or ride-hail­ing firm Go­jek’s gen­eral man­ager Lien Choong Luen, 43. Each is lead­ing a slate of nine.</p>
    <p>But will the change in lead­er­ship fi­nally bring about har­mony in a frac­tured scene? Both hope­fuls ad­mit the lo­cal fra­ter­nity is dis­united.</p>
    <p>CUL­TURE OF CON­FLICT</p>
    <p>Pereira, who had un­suc­cess­ful bids for the SA pres­i­dency in 1984, 2000 and 2016, counted this as the big­gest chal­lenge SA’s in­com­ing lead­er­ship faces.</p>
    <p>“There is a lot of dis­cord. This is un­for­tu­nate and at­ten­tion is taken away from the ath­letes and their as­pi­ra­tions,” said the leader of TeamSGP Ath­let­ics.</p>
    <p>“Ath­letes, coaches and the ad­min­is­tra­tion must sit down and work on their dif­fer­ences. All the stake­hold­ers must work to­wards a com­mon goal.”</p>
    <p>Lien, when asked to sum up in one word what SA ur­gently needs, replied: “Trust.”</p>
    <p>The lack of it, said the leader of Team Ground Up, is partly the rea­son SA has found it­self em­broiled in le­gal cases.</p>
    <p>Lien, who vowed to try to bring the dis­putes back to the me­di­a­tion ta­ble and out of the me­dia spot­light, said: “Struc­turally, th­ese cases arise due to a deficit of trust among the community, as well as con­flict of in­ter­ests be­tween the re­spon­si­bil­ity of their of­fi­cial po­si­tions and cases that may arise.</p>
    <p>“We need to stop the cul­ture of res­o­lu­tion through me­dia or lit­i­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>“This hap­pens be­cause ath­letes feel that there is no due process or op­por­tu­nity for re­course when there is con­flict.”</p>
    <p>SA is cur­rently in­volved in le­gal pro­ceed­ings with two-time SEA Games marathon gold medal­list Soh Rui Yong over com­ments made re­gard­ing his omis­sion from the 2019 Games.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal ath­let­ics has also courted neg­a­tive head­lines in re­cent years with leaked What­sApp chats ap­pear­ing to show plots against coaches and the sud­den res­ig­na­tions of national coaches and man­age­ment com­mit­tee mem­bers fol­low­ing in­ter­nal dis­putes.</p>
    <p>Ath­letes’ per­for­mances have been af­fected, as seen in the 2019 SEA Games when the team failed to win a sin­gle gold medal for the first time since 1991.</p>
    <p>BACK TO WIN­NING WAYS</p>
    <p>Both Pereira and Lien hope to de­liver some im­prove­ment at the next edi­tion of the SEA Games in Hanoi next Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>While Lien noted that the win­dow to ef­fect change is small, he said there is much SA can do to help its ath­letes, such as “pro­vide suit­able lo­cal op­por­tu­ni­ties for qual­i­fi­ca­tions with op­ti­mised con­di­tions”.</p>
    <p>For Pereira, he hopes to have enough time to groom po­ten­tial tal­ents who his team have ear­marked to “win at re­gional level, and then higher”.</p>
    <p>To that end, Pereira and his team, who fea­ture in­cum­bent SA vice-pres­i­dent (train­ing and se­lec­tion) Ang Peng Siong and vice-pres­i­dent (com­pe­ti­tions) S. Govin­daraju, have pledged to carry out the multi-year sports plan (MYSP) laid out by the cur­rent lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>Team Ground Up fea­ture no mem­bers of the cur­rent com­mit­tee, al­though two of their can­di­dates, Joe Yap and Gary Yeo, had served pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>While Lien said they agree with the plan’s broad strokes, he added that there are “po­ten­tial op­por­tu­ni­ties to en­hance be­yond the MYSP”.</p>
    <p>“A multi-year plan is im­por­tant, but more crit­i­cal is the abil­ity to have a strong ex­e­cu­tion abil­ity with the will­ing­ness to main­tain open lines of com­mu­ni­ca­tions and feed­back,” he said.</p>
    <p>GET­TING BACK ON TRACK</p>
    <p>Over the past two weeks, both TeamSGP Ath­let­ics and Team Ground Up have pre­sented their plans to help lift track and field to the af­fil­i­ates.</p>
    <p>Lien’s team an­nounced that they have se­cured $100,000 in do­na­tions to get their plans go­ing if they are voted in. Th­ese in­clude turn­ing In­sti­tutes of Higher Learn­ing into re­gional train­ing cen­tres and pro­vid­ing coaches for ath­letes from schools that do not fo­cus on ath­let­ics, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Pereira’s team un­veiled eight work­ing com­mit­tees over­see­ing ar­eas such as ath­lete de­vel­op­ment, coach­ing and train­ing, fund-rais­ing and spon­sor­ship. It has also set a goal of rais­ing up to $1 mil­lion in spon­sor­ship to carry out its plans.</p>
    <p>But TeamSGP Ath­let­ics hit a hur­dle last week when man­age­ment com­mit­tee can­di­date and for­mer national sprinter U.K. Shyam with­drew his can­di­dacy, cit­ing work com­mit­ments. He was re­placed by Fahmy Raimi, the chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer of dig­i­tal mar­ket­ing firm RAWR Global.</p>
    <p>But Pereira said: “Ul­ti­mately, it is the en­tire team dy­nam­ics which mat­ter, and we have a good di­verse team of tal­ents at the ta­ble want­ing to serve.</p>
    <p>“I strongly be­lieve they have the abil­ity to make a dif­fer­ence and help to move the sport ahead.”</p>
    <p>Lien was equally bullish about his team’s abil­ity to steer lo­cal ath­let­ics back on the right path, say­ing he be­lieved that those within the fra­ter­nity have been “mo­ti­vated by what they think is best for the sport”, de­spite the re­cent trou­bles.</p>
    <p>He added: “We are a fresh team un­en­cum­bered by his­tory which al­lows the best op­por­tu­nity to break from the cur­rent cul­ture.”</p>
