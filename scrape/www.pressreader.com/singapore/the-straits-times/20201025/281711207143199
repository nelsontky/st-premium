    <p>SOFIA • Bul­garia’s cap­i­tal Sofia, home to some two mil­lion peo­ple, will close night­clubs and dis­cos for two weeks from to­day as it grap­ples to con­tain a surge in coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions strain­ing its health system, Mayor Yor­danka Fan­dakova said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing on na­tional BTV tele­vi­sion, Ms Fan­dakova also urged Sofia uni­ver­si­ties to switch to on­line ed­u­ca­tion and ap­pealed to busi­nesses to have as many em­ploy­ees as pos­si­ble work from home.</p>
    <p>“The sit­u­a­tion is Sofia is be­com­ing in­creas­ingly alarm­ing. We have a new in­crease in in­fec­tions and of peo­ple who need hospi­tal treat­ment. This is strain­ing the hos­pi­tals,” she said.</p>
    <p>Bul­garia, like many other Euro­pean Union coun­tries, has seen a steep rise in new in­fec­tions over the past three weeks.</p>
    <p>There were 1,589 new in­fec­tions re­ported yes­ter­day in the coun­try of seven mil­lion peo­ple, bring­ing the to­tal to 36,519.</p>
    <p>Num­ber of Bul­gar­ian Cab­i­net mem­bers, in­clud­ing Prime Min­is­ter Boyko Borissov, who have been self-iso­lat­ing since Fri­day af­ter a deputy min­is­ter they were in con­tact with tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>New cases in Sofia alone were 584, data from the coro­n­avirus in­for­ma­tion plat­form showed.</p>
    <p>Smaller pro­vin­cial cities with high num­bers of in­fec­tions like Pernik, 36km west of Sofia, as well as Sliven in the south-west and Shu­men in the north-east, have also opted to close night­clubs for two weeks.</p>
    <p>The fast spread of the in­fec­tion is putting the Balkan coun­try’s health system un­der great stress and the Bul­gar­ian au­thor­i­ties have banned non-ur­gent surgery in re­gions that have more than 120 in­fec­tions per 100,000 peo­ple, to pro­vide more bed ca­pac­ity for coro­n­avirus pa­tients.</p>
    <p>As of yes­ter­day, some 1,886 peo­ple with Covid-19 were be­ing treated in hos­pi­tals, with 127 in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boyko Borissov along with three min­is­ters of his Cab­i­net have been self-iso­lat­ing since Fri­day af­ter a deputy min­is­ter they were in con­tact with tested pos­i­tive for the virus.</p>
