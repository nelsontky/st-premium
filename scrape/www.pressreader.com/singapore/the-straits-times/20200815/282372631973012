    <p>• Mesut Ozil has dug his heels in, in­sist­ing he will not be forced out of Arse­nal de­spite the English Premier League club’s des­per­a­tion to get him off the wage bill.</p>
    <p>The 2014 World Cup win­ner with Ger­many did not play a sin­gle minute for the Gun­ners after the English top flight restarted in June, and was not even on the bench.</p>
    <p>It ap­pears he is tak­ing the same path as former Nether­lands cen­tre­back Win­ston Bog­a­rde, who fa­mously re­fused to leave Chelsea de­spite the club’s at­tempts to sell him, pre­fer­ring to run down his £40,000 (S$72,000)-a-week deal in the re­serves till it ex­pired in 2004.</p>
    <p>Ozil, 31, earns a re­ported £350,000 a week, but has rarely pro­vided good value since his 2013 move from Real Madrid.</p>
    <p>How­ever, with one year left on his deal, he re­mains in a po­si­tion of power with re­gards to his fu­ture.</p>
    <p>While Turk­ish clubs are said to be keen, they can­not af­ford his wages and, with lit­tle in­ter­est else­where, he has ev­ery in­ten­tion of re­main­ing at the Emi­rates next sea­son.</p>
    <p>Ozil told The Ath­letic on Thurs­day: “Things have been dif­fi­cult but I love Arse­nal. I’ll de­cide when I go, not other peo­ple.</p>
    <p>“I’ll give ev­ery­thing I have for this club. Si­t­u­a­tions like these will never break me, they only make me stronger. I showed in the past that I can come back into the team and I will show it again.”</p>
    <p>Arse­nal man­ager Mikel Arteta claimed the player’s ex­ile was down to “foot­ball rea­sons”, but Ozil, who started all 10 of the club’s league games un­til the coron­avirus pan­demic prompted the com­pe­ti­tion’s shut­down in March, be­lieves he de­serves an­other chance.</p>
    <p>Arteta and most of the Arse­nal squad ac­cepted a 12.5 per cent pay cut in April as a re­sult of the fi­nan­cial fall­out from the pan­demic, although Ozil was one of three play­ers who re­fused.</p>
    <p>He is con­cerned that de­ci­sion is be­ing held against him and feels that there is an agenda to get him to leave against his will.</p>
    <p>“I guess that’s be­cause it is me and peo­ple have been try­ing for two years to de­stroy me, to make me un­happy, to push an agenda they hope will turn the sup­port­ers against me and paint a pic­ture that is not true,” he said.</p>
    <p>Separately, Arse­nal yes­ter­day an­nounced the sign­ing of Wil­lian, 32, on a free trans­fer from Chelsea.</p>
    <p>Arteta lauded the Brazil mid­fielder, who had nine league goals for the Blues last term and will earn a re­ported £200,000 a week un­til 2023, as “a player that can re­ally make a dif­fer­ence for us”.</p>
