    <p>For some pet own­ers, ar­rang­ing dig­ni­fied fu­neral rites for their dead pets is a must, even if it means fork­ing out hun­dreds of dol­lars.</p>
    <p>They have en­gaged or­gan­i­sa­tions that run pet cre­ma­tion ser­vices to help them ar­range a send-off for their pets, which range from dogs to ham­sters to prized arowana.</p>
    <p>Some pet own­ers even get Bud­dhist monks and pas­tors to per­form fi­nal rites.</p>
    <p>A check by The Sun­day Times found that there are at least five ser­vice providers of­fer­ing pet cre­ma­tion ser­vices in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Dr Chang Siow Foong, group di­rec­tor of pro­fes­sional and sci­en­tific ser­vices at the Na­tional Parks Board’s An­i­mal and Vet­eri­nary Ser­vice (AVS), told ST that while the AVS reg­u­lates an­i­mal-re­lated ac­tiv­i­ties in or­der to safe­guard an­i­mal health and wel­fare, cre­ma­tion ser­vices for pets are not re­quired to be li­censed by AVS.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if an AVS-li­censed vet­eri­nary clinic wants to pro­vide pet cre­ma­tion ser­vices on its premises, it would have to seek ap­provals from AVS and other rel­e­vant agen­cies.</p>
    <p>There are cur­rently two cre­ma­tion ser­vice providers for pets op­er­at­ing within AVS-li­censed premises: Mount Pleas­ant Vet­eri­nary Cen­tre at 5 Mandai Road, and The An­i­mal Re­sort at Sele­tar West Farmway 5.</p>
    <p>“AVS recog­nises that cre­ma­tion ser­vices for pets when they have passed on should be pro­vided in a sen­si­tive man­ner, with em­pa­thy to­wards the griev­ing pet owner,” said Dr Chang.</p>
    <p>ST asked both Mount Pleas­ant</p>
    <p>Vet­eri­nary Cen­tre and The An­i­mal Re­sort for com­ment for this re­port, but did not re­ceive a re­sponse by press time.</p>
    <p>Mr Ilex Tan, a staff mem­ber at Rain­bow Paradise Pet Cre­ma­tion Ser­vices, said it charges $228 to cre­mate dogs un­der 10kg in a pri­vate, cus­tomis­able cer­e­mony, and $548 for huge dogs that weigh over 40kg.</p>
    <p>Family mem­bers and friends are al­lowed to view the cre­ma­tion process. Mr Tan han­dles ap­prox­i­mately 10 cre­ma­tions a week.</p>
    <p>Other than dogs, Rain­bow Paradise, which opened in 2018, has han­dled the fu­ner­als of many other kinds of pets, in­clud­ing ham­sters, rab­bits, birds and, re­cently, an arowana.</p>
    <p>Own­ers can cus­tomise their pets’ fi­nal jour­neys, such as by plac­ing the an­i­mals on lush beds of flow­ers, with some en­gag­ing pas­tors and Bud­dhist monks to per­form the last rites.</p>
    <p>Hedge fund man­ager Daniel Kim or­gan­ised a pri­vate cer­e­mony at Mount Pleas­ant last year for his friends and family to bid farewell to his 12-year-old jindo dog named Light­ning.</p>
    <p>The 31-year-old spared no ex­pense: Light­ning was placed on a bed of white roses and a pas­tor was en­gaged to per­form a Chris­tian cer­e­mony, while sooth­ing mu­sic played in the back­ground.</p>
    <p>“It was a very sweet mo­ment for all of us,” said Mr Kim. “We had so many good mem­o­ries with Light­ning and we wanted to give him the grand good­bye he de­served.”</p>
