    <p>Mr Adar Poon­awalla gave him­self a head start in the race to pro­duce a Covid-19 vac­cine.</p>
    <p>In April, Mr Poon­awalla, 39, an­nounced that his com­pany, Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia, the world’s largest vac­cine man­u­fac­turer, would start crank­ing out vac­cine doses be­ing de­vel­oped by the Univer­sity of Ox­ford and the global bio­pharma com­pany As­traZeneca.</p>
    <p>Fail­ure would have meant a use­less stock­pile of vac­cines, but the bet has so far paid off.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine, AZD1222, has so far shown an ef­fi­cacy of up 90 per cent in ad­vanced tri­als.</p>
    <p>“Risk tak­ing is a part of ev­ery busi­ness. I be­lieve that since we have the ca­pa­bil­ity and the ca­pac­ity to help, it is our re­spon­si­bil­ity to take the man­tle ahead, es­pe­cially in the on­go­ing pan­demic,” said Mr Poon­awalla in an e-mail in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>The Serum In­sti­tute of In­dia, which pro­duces and sells 1.5 bil­lion doses an­nu­ally, is ex­pected to help ef­forts to­wards lev­el­ling the play­ing field for In­dia and other mid­dle- and lower-in­come coun­tries in en­sur­ing cost-ef­fec­tive vac­cines.</p>
    <p>The in­sti­tute has started off by pro­duc­ing 40 mil­lion doses of the vac­cine, which will re­tail for US$3 (S$4) to US$4 per dose for gov­ern­ment pro­cure­ment and US$5 to US$6 for direct pri­vate sales.</p>
    <p>It has also inked vac­cine deals with Coda­genix, an Amer­i­can clin­i­cal-stage biotech firm, global pharma gi­ant Merck and US firm No­vavax.</p>
    <p>By next month, the In­dian firm will have 100 mil­lion doses ready.</p>
    <p>Nearly half of the As­traZeneca and No­vavax doses will be for In­dia and other mid­dle- and low-in­come coun­tries apart from 200 mil­lion doses through Gavi, The Vac­cine Al­liance – a pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ship that helps vac­ci­nate half the world’s chil­dren – and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foun­da­tion.</p>
    <p>All this has thrust Mr Poon­awalla, the ar­tic­u­late face of the fam­ily-run firm, into the global lime­light. The Serum In­sti­tute was founded by his fa­ther Cyrus Poon­awalla in 1966, branch­ing off from the fam­ily’s stud farm busi­ness.</p>
    <p>The younger Poon­awalla, who took over as chief ex­ec­u­tive at 30, has driven the com­pany’s ex­pan­sion. Its pres­ence has grown from 35 coun­tries to 170. The firm has ramped up its pro­duc­tion of po­lio vac­cines. Last month, it added a new fa­cil­ity that can man­u­fac­ture half a bil­lion vac­cine doses a year.</p>
    <p>Mr Poon­awalla noted that the pharma in­dus­try is a tough place to do busi­ness, but is proud that 65 per cent of all chil­dren glob­ally have re­ceived a Serum In­sti­tute vac­cine at least once.</p>
    <p>Mr Poon­awalla and his wife Natasha, the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the in­sti­tute, are also known for their jet-set­ting life­style and for hob­nob­bing with Bol­ly­wood celebri­ties.</p>
    <p>He told GQ mag­a­zine this year that un­der nor­mal cir­cum­stances, he would have been sail­ing down the coast in Cannes on a yacht with his fam­ily, watch­ing the Grand Prix and at­tend­ing the film fes­ti­val, but said what he was do­ing now “more than com­pen­sates”.</p>
