    <p>Rents for busi­ness parks in the city fringe in Sin­ga­pore are pro­jected to rise as more com­pa­nies seek out busi­ness parks with Grade A of­fice spec­i­fi­ca­tions in a bid to cut their real es­tate costs.</p>
    <p>In the third quar­ter of this year, their rents stood at $5.91 per square foot (psf) per month, up 0.2 per cent quar­ter on quar­ter and 2.4 per cent from a year ago, ac­cord­ing to data from real es­tate ser­vices com­pany Cush­man & Wake­field.</p>
    <p>An­other fac­tor in the shift to busi­ness parks is the num­ber of cor­po­rates with a large pro­por­tion of em­ploy­ees work­ing from home, re­sult­ing in less need for Cen­tral Busi­ness District (CBD) of­fice space, said Ms Chris­tine Li, its head of re­search for Sin­ga­pore and South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>“The move­ment to­wards busi­ness parks with Grade A spec­i­fi­ca­tions along with the con­tin­ued mod­er­a­tion of Grade A CBD rents will fur­ther nar­row the rental gap be­tween CBD of­fice and city fringe busi­ness park space over the next few quar­ters.”</p>
    <p>This trend is ex­pected to re­verse af­ter Grade A CBD rents fall by a pro­jected 20 per cent next year and be­come more af­ford­able. How­ever, rents for busi­ness parks in out­ly­ing ar­eas will slide due to their older stock. Rents in the third quar­ter stood at $3.64 psf per month.</p>
    <p>An­other bright spot is the prime lo­gis­tics seg­ment, where rents are ex­pected to rise due to a strong pref­er­ence for ramp-up fa­cil­i­ties. In the third quar­ter, the rents rose by 1.5 per cent on the quar­ter.</p>
