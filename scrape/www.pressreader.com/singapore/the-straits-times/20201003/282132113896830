    <p>De­spite surge pric­ing, es­pe­cially when it is rain­ing or dur­ing an MRT break­down, Sin­ga­pore­ans feel like they have no choice but to ac­cept the higher costs when us­ing ride-hail­ing apps, re­search by three Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore (NUS) pro­fes­sors showed.</p>
    <p>This, and other in­sights, are con­tained in Ki­a­su­nomics 2: Eco­nomic In­sights For Ever­day Life.</p>
    <p>The book aims to help peo­ple un­der­stand how Sin­ga­pore­ans make eco­nomic de­ci­sions, and also gives tips on avoid­ing the pit­falls of act­ing based sim­ply on gut feel­ing.</p>
    <p>The se­quel to Ki­a­su­nomics: Sto­ries Of Singaporea­n Eco­nomic Be­hav­iours also prom­ises to an­swer ques­tions such as “Why would you shop more un­der sunny weather?” and “What ef­fects does a bank­rupt neigh­bour have on res­i­dents liv­ing in the es­tate?”</p>
    <p>It is sup­ple­mented with comics which the writ­ers hope will help make the dense aca­demic re­search ac­ces­si­ble to, as one of the three au­thors, Pro­fes­sor Sumit Agar­wal put it, even “my 10-yearold daughter”.</p>
    <p>The NUS Business School pro­fes­sor said: “What we want to tell the lay­man is that we are busy solv­ing the prob­lems and pro­vid­ing an­swers to their day-to-day prob­lems.</p>
    <p>“Ob­vi­ously, the world is a com­plex place and we can­not solve all the is­sues but we try to help the pol­i­cy­mak­ers and the pri­vate sec­tor make bet­ter poli­cies and bet­ter prod­ucts,” he said.</p>
    <p>At the vir­tual book launch held at NUS business school on Thurs­day, pan­el­lists in­clud­ing Min­is­ter for Trans­port Ong Ye Kung talked about how the Hous­ing Board (HDB) sub­si­dies have helped main­tain so­cial mo­bil­ity be­tween the lower and mid­dle classes.</p>
    <p>They also dis­cussed the prof­its and con­ve­niences elec­tronic pay­ment has brought to banks, busi­nesses and buy­ers by re­duc­ing the use of cash, as well as how re­tirees who are on gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies are spend­ing their money.</p>
    <p>A re­cur­ring theme was how such analy­ses are only pos­si­ble with data sup­plied by min­istries as well as lenders like DBS Bank, with co­op­er­a­tion be­tween aca­demics and these play­ers reap­ing ben­e­fits that can be en­joyed by all.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said gov­ern­ment agen­cies have been more will­ing to share data in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>“We are mak­ing progress. If you ask most gov­ern­ment agen­cies and min­istries ‘Should you share data with re­searchers to un­der­stand your prob­lem bet­ter?’, most of them will say yes,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added: “You all (aca­demics) need to be thick-skinned enough to ask.”</p>
    <p>But he also said that for or­gan­i­sa­tions to be will­ing to share data, re­searchers will have to cul­ti­vate good work­ing re­la­tion­ships with them so that there is trust.</p>
    <p>“Ul­ti­mately data come when you have good re­la­tions as well, and to (look at) prob­lems in a way that all of us are in­ter­ested to solve them and tackle them.”</p>
    <p>Books that are firmly si­t­u­ated in the lo­cal con­text can also help at­tract more young Sin­ga­pore­ans to be­come aca­demics in­ter­ested in solv­ing lo­cal prob­lems, he said.</p>
    <p>The other two au­thors of Ki­a­su­nomics 2 are NUS pro­fes­sors Ang Swee Hoon and Sing Tien Foo.</p>
    <p>The pa­per­back ver­sion is avail­able at $28, and the hard­back at $58, at all ma­jor book­stores.</p>
    <p>SOLV­ING EV­ERY­DAY PROB­LEMS</p>
    <p>What we want to tell the lay­man is that we are busy solv­ing the prob­lems and pro­vid­ing an­swers to their day-to-day prob­lems... we can­not solve all the is­sues but we try to help the pol­i­cy­mak­ers and the pri­vate sec­tor make bet­ter poli­cies and bet­ter prod­ucts.</p>
