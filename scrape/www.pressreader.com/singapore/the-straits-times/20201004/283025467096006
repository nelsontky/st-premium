    <p>There were 89,700 un­em­ployed Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents here in June, in­clud­ing fresh grad­u­ates and newly re­trenched in­di­vid­u­als.</p>
    <p>De­ter­mined to land a job, you’ve sent in hun­dreds of ap­pli­ca­tions and fi­nally lined up some in­ter­views.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness pre­sen­ta­tion coach Steve Daw­son says get­ting to the in­ter­view stage based on your writ­ten ap­pli­ca­tion, cur­ricu­lum vi­tae (CV) and qual­i­fi­ca­tions means you are some­body the hirer thinks can do the job.</p>
    <p>“The in­ter­view is there­fore all about whether you will be a good fit – whether you match the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s cul­ture and have the char­ac­ter for the unique de­mands of the role,” he says.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­view is go­ing to be a con­ver­sa­tion, so be pre­pared to be open and ap­proach­able, he adds.</p>
    <p>Here are five tips on how to make a good im­pres­sion:</p>
    <p>1. Nerves are good</p>
    <p>Have a little smile to your­self if you feel ner­vous, says Mr Daw­son.</p>
    <p>Nerves help you fo­cus on the task at hand and al­low you to be present, rather than dis­tracted. They are your body’s way of telling you that this is a moment where you can rise to the chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>If you are too re­laxed, you will nei­ther per­form nor ap­pear en­thu­si­as­tic or en­gaged.</p>
    <p>But if nerves start to over­whelm you, breathe in through the nose, hold for two sec­onds and ex­hale.</p>
    <p>2. Re­search the com­pany</p>
    <p>This is where you can as­sess and then demon­strate whether you will be a good cul­tural fit.</p>
    <p>Ex­plore the com­pany’s web­site and make sure you un­der­stand ex­actly what it does in Sin­ga­pore. But also check if it has overseas oper­a­tions and learn what the com­pany does glob­ally.</p>
    <p>If you are for­tu­nate enough to know some peo­ple from the com­pany, speak to them be­fore your in­ter­view. Ask them about the cul­ture, what it is like to work there and what the firm seems to value, says Mr Daw­son.</p>
    <p>Get to know its prod­ucts or ser­vices first-hand if pos­si­ble, so that it will be much eas­ier to speak about a tan­gi­ble con­nec­tion be­tween your­self and what the com­pany of­fers.</p>
    <p>3. Re­search your­self</p>
    <p>Be fa­mil­iar with your CV, as it in­cludes the key ref­er­ence points for in­ter­view­ers to quiz you.</p>
    <p>Re­view your CV to spot the ques­tions and talk­ing points they might se­lect. Ask your­self the ques­tions you would ask if a can­di­date pre­sented this CV to you.</p>
    <p>“Talk­ing about your­self is usu­ally among the eas­i­est things you can do in an in­ter­view, so mine your rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ences for the more in­ter­est­ing anec­dotes and learning points that have come from the mile­stones de­tailed on your CV,” says Mr Daw­son.</p>
    <p>Above all, he re­minds, be au­then­tic. Do not get caught out try­ing to be some­thing you are not.</p>
    <p>4. Mind your body lan­guage</p>
    <p>This will be­come a key in­di­ca­tor as the in­ter­viewer tries to as­sess whether you will be a good fit for the team.</p>
    <p>Lean for­ward, smile and lis­ten. When you speak, do not sit on your hands. In­stead, use them to am­plify what you are say­ing and show your en­thu­si­asm.</p>
    <p>Ap­pear­ing at­ten­tive and en­gaged shows a will­ing­ness to take part, con­trib­ute and ex­plore the un­known.</p>
    <p>5. Pre­pare for on­line in­ter­views</p>
    <p>Dress ap­pro­pri­ately for on­line in­ter­views, even though they are not face-to-face meet­ings.</p>
    <p>You can take this down a notch, how­ever, if you are be­ing in­ter­viewed in your home. There is no need for a suit and tie if you are sit­ting in your bed­room, says Mr Daw­son.</p>
    <p>He rec­om­mends think­ing of the or­gan­i­sa­tion and role you are ap­ply­ing for, and us­ing that as a guide for the dress code.</p>
    <p>It is of­ten about con­form­ity and how you will fit in with the group you will be work­ing with. In­di­vid­u­al­ism is val­ued but the in­ter­view­ers need to know that if they hire you and take you to meet the big boss or a client, you will look the part and rep­re­sent the brand well.</p>
    <p>“When I was a stu­dent, I didn’t have a pair of black dress socks to go with my suit, so I im­pro­vised,” says Mr Daw­son.</p>
    <p>“The in­ter­viewer men­tioned that I might be called back for a sec­ond in­ter­view, but added: ‘Next time, don’t wear foot­ball socks.’”</p>
