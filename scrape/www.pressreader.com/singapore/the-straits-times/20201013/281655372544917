    <p>The re­tail sec­tor may have taken a beat­ing dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, but there are still some 2,500 jobs on of­fer as stores re­open and more busi­nesses turn to e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>Nearly two in five of these jobs are for pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs), said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo in her weekly jobs sit­u­a­tion re­port yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>These are roles such as sales, mar­ket­ing and busi­ness de­vel­op­ment man­agers, with monthly salaries of be­tween $2,750 and $6,500, with a me­dian of $3,750.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, re­tail and whole­sale trade man­agers typ­i­cally earn be­tween $2,000 and $3,750 each month, with a me­dian of $2,700.</p>
    <p>The job roles also in­clude com­mer­cial and mar­ket­ing sales ex­ec­u­tives, who typ­i­cally re­ceive be­tween $2,400 and $4,250 monthly, with a me­dian of $3,200.</p>
    <p>The non-PMET jobs such as shop sales staff typ­i­cally re­ceive monthly salaries of $1,400 to $1,900, with a me­dian of $1,600.</p>
    <p>These non-PMET roles are nec­es­sary to meet im­me­di­ate man­power</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic forced many re­tail­ers to move their op­er­a­tions on­line on e-com­merce plat­forms, and use tech­nolo­gies such as live-stream­ing and vir­tual re­al­ity to en­gage with cus­tomers, said MOM... To help re­tail­ers re­design jobs and cre­ate higher-value roles, as well as transform their busi­nesses, Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s Job Re­design Reskilling Pro­gramme was en­hanced in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>needs for front-of-house op­er­a­tions, as re­tail stores re­sumed op­er­a­tions af­ter the end of the cir­cuit breaker, said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>At the same time, re­tail­ers are also in­creas­ingly look­ing to hire PMETs who have dig­i­tal skills to help their busi­nesses grow on e-com­merce plat­forms, she added.</p>
    <p>Apart from jobs, there are also about 610 com­pany-hosted trainee­ships and at­tach­ments as well as about 430 train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties avail­able in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Be­tween April and last month, 770 in­di­vid­u­als were placed into jobs, en­hanced roles, trainee­ships and at­tach­ments as well as train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in the re­tail sec­tor, said the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM).</p>
    <p>Of these, about 700 ei­ther found a job or were able to re­tain their job in new or en­hanced roles within the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>RE­DESIGN­ING JOBS</p>
    <p>The im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic forced many re­tail­ers to move their op­er­a­tions on­line on ecom­merce plat­forms, and use tech­nolo­gies such as live-stream­ing and vir­tual re­al­ity to en­gage with cus­tomers, said MOM.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, nearly 11 per cent of to­tal re­tail sales value came from on­line pur­chases, said the min­istry.</p>
    <p>This was higher in cer­tain sub­sec­tors such as com­puter and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions equip­ment, which saw e-com­merce ac­count for nearly 50 per cent of their sales.</p>
    <p>To help re­tail­ers re­design jobs and cre­ate higher-value roles, as well as transform their busi­nesses, Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s Job Re­design Reskilling Pro­gramme was en­hanced in Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>As at end-Au­gust, more than 550 work­ers from 37 re­tail­ers</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo and Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing ob­serv­ing a live-stream­ing re­hearsal yes­ter­day by SK Jew­ellery Group at the com­pany’s head­quar­ters in Changi Busi­ness Park. Re­tail­ers are in­creas­ingly look­ing to hire PMETs who have dig­i­tal skills to help their busi­nesses grow on e-com­merce plat­forms, said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>have been or are be­ing trained and re­de­ployed into new or high­er­value job roles through the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>About 40 per cent of them will re­ceive a higher wage af­ter com­plet­ing the train­ing, while the em­ploy­ers of the rest have com­mit­ted to re­view­ing their wages af­ter the Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion sta­bilises, said MOM.</p>
    <p>EM­PLOY­ING SE­NIORS</p>
    <p>MOM also gave an up­date yes­ter­day on its ef­forts to en­cour­age com­pa­nies to hire older work­ers in re­tail and other sec­tors.</p>
    <p>In July, ap­pli­ca­tions opened for em­ploy­ers to seek fund­ing sup­port of up to $375,000 through the Se</p>
    <p>nior Worker Early Adopter Grant (SW EAG) and Part-time Re-em­ploy­ment Grant (PTRG), which were in­tro­duced as part of the $1.3 bil­lion Se­nior Worker Sup­port Pack­age.</p>
    <p>In the first three months of ap­pli­ca­tions, nearly 650 com­pa­nies ap­plied for the SW EAG, while about 440 ap­plied for the PTRG, said MOM.</p>
    <p>Al­most all were small to medi­um­sized en­ter­prises, in­clud­ing those in the re­tail sec­tor, and about 37,000 em­ploy­ees will ben­e­fit from the grants.</p>
    <p>The re­tail sec­tor is one of the top sec­tors em­ploy­ing se­nior work­ers, with nearly one in three em­ploy­ees aged 55 or older.</p>
