    <p>Im­pos­ing quo­tas on higher-end for­eign pro­fes­sion­als on Em­ploy­ment Passes is not un­think­able, but such a move would prob­a­bly be un­wise, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo told Par­lia­ment. It is much bet­ter to use salary re­quire­ments, she said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Im­pos­ing quo­tas on higher-end for­eign pro­fes­sion­als on Em­ploy­ment Passes (EPs) is not un­think­able, but such a move would prob­a­bly be un­wise, Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo told Par­lia­ment.</p>
    <p>It is much bet­ter to use salary re­quire­ments to en­sure com­pa­nies can ac­cess for­eign pro­fes­sion­als of the right qual­ity while com­mit­ting to build up their lo­cal staff over time, she said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“With­out such flex­i­bil­ity, many of the top-qual­ity in­vest­ments would have been lost to our com­peti­tors, and the j ob op­por­tu­ni­ties along with them,” she said.</p>
    <p>Eco­nomic agen­cies also need flex­i­bil­ity when com­pet­ing for the most cut­ting-edge in­vest­ments and so­phis­ti­cated ac­tiv­i­ties to be moved to Sin­ga­pore, she added.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo was re­spond­ing to MPs in the par­lia­men­tary de­bate on the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress, and out­lined the Govern­ment’s con­sid­er­a­tions in man­ag­ing the for­eign work­force here as well as its ef­forts to sup­port Sin­ga­porean pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians (PMETs), es­pe­cially those in their 40s and 50s.</p>
    <p>“We must there­fore not miss the wood for the trees, by fo­cus­ing nar­rowly on keep­ing for­eign­ers out, and miss­ing the larger pic­ture of grow­ing the pie and giv­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans the chance of the best slice,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mr Pa­trick Tay (Pi­o­neer) and Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) had on Mon­day sug­gested in­tro­duc­ing tiered quo­tas for EP hold­ers based on dif­fer­ent pay lev­els or sec­tors, which would limit the share of a firm’s em­ploy­ees who can be on EPs.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said that at the work per­mit level, the Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) uses levies on top of quo­tas to reg­u­late de­mand be­cause the num­bers of work­ers are large – 737,200 as at last De­cem­ber, not in­clud­ing do­mes­tic helpers.</p>
    <p>There are also quo­tas lim­it­ing a firm’s share of for­eign­ers on S Passes, who are those earn­ing at least $2,400 a month.</p>
    <p>But at the EP level where the num­bers are not as big – there were 190,000 work­ing here in June – the key ob­jec­tive is to reg­u­late qual­ity, said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>The min­i­mum qual­i­fy­ing salary for new EP ap­pli­ca­tions rose to $4,500 yes­ter­day, up from $3,900. The change af­fects pass re­newals from May next year.</p>
    <p>With the ad­just­ment in salary re­quire­ment, lower-end EP hold­ers will be pushed down to the S Pass level where they are sub­ject to the quota, some­thing which levies do not do, said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>As for em­ploy­ers who falsely de­clare salaries to meet the higher bar, and then claw back money from for­eign em­ploy­ees un­der the ta­ble, the an­swer is to strengthen en­force­ment, she added.</p>
    <p>In the last five years, MOM has taken ac­tion in over 1,200 cases of false dec­la­ra­tions or kick­backs, which led to 388 con­vic­tions through pros­e­cu­tion, she said.</p>
    <p>She noted the anx­i­ety and height­ened sense of in­se­cu­rity about jobs, amid the se­vere im­pact of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Although un­em­ploy­ment has not reached the highs of past re­ces­sions, it is not a given that this will re­main so, she said.</p>
    <p>In the last se­vere eco­nomic down­turn amid the 2009 global fi­nan­cial cri­sis, Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct (GDP) man­aged to grow by 0.1 per cent af­ter a $20.5 bil­lion Re­silience Pack­age.</p>
    <p>This year, the Govern­ment has in­tro­duced four Bud­gets with sup­port cost­ing close to $100 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>But GDP is ex­pected to shrink by 5 per cent to 7 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Said Mrs Teo: “We are still in the mid­dle of a storm, and it will be some time be­fore we see ‘green shoots’.”</p>
    <p>The num­ber of EP and S Pass hold­ers has fallen by 22,000 be­tween Jan­uary and July this year, she added.</p>
    <p>Still, said the min­is­ter, in this pe­riod of great un­cer­tainty, mid­dleaged lo­cal PMETs are es­pe­cially con­cerned about be­ing dis­ad­van­taged dur­ing re­trench­ments com­pared with younger for­eign col­leagues, and be­ing passed over in job ap­pli­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo said MOM ac­tively mon­i­tors re­trench­ment prac­tices, and looks into as­pects such as whether the em­ployer tried other cost-sav­ing mea­sures be­fore con­sid­er­ing re­trench­ments and whether the com­pany’s Sin­ga­porean core was weak­ened as a re­sult of the re­trench­ment ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>She noted that some­times, older work­ers com­prise a larger share of work­ers re­trenched by a firm be­cause their skill sets are less rel­e­vant to core func­tions.</p>
    <p>But there has gen­er­ally not been a weak­en­ing of the Sin­ga­porean core in cases seen by the min­istry, she said. For in­stance, when Re­sorts World Sen­tosa laid off work­ers in July, for­eign em­ploy­ees had to meet a higher per­for­mance bar than lo­cals to be re­tained.</p>
    <p>There are also schemes to fur­ther sup­port lo­cal PMETs, such as the new $1 bil­lion Jobs Growth In­cen­tive, the na­tion’s “big­gest push ever” to help em­ploy­ers stretch their man­power bud­gets and hire more lo­cals, she added.</p>
    <p>BEN­E­FIT OF SALARY RE­QUIRE­MENTS</p>
    <p>With­out such flex­i­bil­ity, many of the top-qual­ity in­vest­ments would have been lost to our com­peti­tors, and the job op­por­tu­ni­ties ’’ along with them.</p>

    <p>DON’T MISS THE BIG PIC­TURE</p>
    <p>We must there­fore not miss the wood for the trees, by fo­cus­ing nar­rowly on keep­ing for­eign­ers out, and miss­ing the larger pic­ture of grow­ing the pie and giv­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans the chance of the best ’’ slice.</p>
