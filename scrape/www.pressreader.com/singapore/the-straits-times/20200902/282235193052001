    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) • Call Jimmy But­ler a ball hog all you want, but when he is in the mood, there is lit­tle other Na­tional Bas­ket­ball As­so­ci­a­tion teams can do to con­tain him, even when they are the top seeds.</p>
    <p>The Mil­wau­kee Bucks learnt that the hard way as the All-Star seized con­trol down the stretch, scor­ing a ca­reer play-off high of 40 points as the Mi­ami Heat stunned the ti­tle con­tenders 115-104 in the open­ing game of their East­ern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nals on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>But­ler was a one-man wreck­ing crew, scor­ing 13 of Mi­ami’s fi­nal 16 points at Dis­ney World, with 27 of them com­ing in the se­cond half.</p>
    <p>The for­ward even warned team­mates not to ex­pect any passes with the game on the line and that sin­gle-mind­ed­ness is set to con­tinue for the rest of the se­ries.</p>
    <p>“I told (them) I prob­a­bly wasn’t go­ing to pass the ball. I made a cou­ple of shots and they said, ‘That’s fine with me’,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I took it up a level in the fourth. If that’s what needs to hap­pen every game, I have got to do it.”</p>
    <p>The 30-year-old is well known for his abra­sive per­son­al­ity, hav­ing bumped heads at former teams Min­nesota Tim­ber­wolves and Philadel­phia 76ers.</p>
    <p>But it ap­pears that he is now feel­ing at home in Mi­ami, where the fifth-seeded team is cen­tred around his two-way tal­ents.</p>
    <p>Af­ter be­com­ing j ust the third player i n team his­tory with a 40-point game in the play-offs, join­ing greats LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, Heat coach Erik Spoel­stra in­sisted But­ler’s rep­u­ta­tion as a toxic in­flu­ence in the locker room was far from the truth.</p>
    <p>“Jimmy, de­spite what the nar­ra­tive is out there, he’s a very like­able guy, and that helps in a setting like this (the bub­ble),” he said.</p>
    <p>“He just fits ev­ery­thing about us, our fab­ric and who we are. Make or miss, every­body feels com­fort­able when he’s mak­ing those de­ci­sions. He hap­pened to score but he’s a very un­selfish player.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just about him scor­ing the ball, he makes the ap­pro­pri­ate reads depend­ing on what’s needed for that par­tic­u­lar game... we ba­si­cally had to put the ball in his hands. He wants these kinds of mo­ments.”</p>
    <p>But­ler won over Wade and his team­mates since ar­riv­ing from the Six­ers last sum­mer.</p>
    <p>“It’s great to have D-Wade in my cor­ner, I’m telling you. He’s al­ways in my phone, telling me about the game, what to look for. He’s been a huge help. He’s the first per­son that texts me tonight when­ever I get back to the locker room,” he said of the re­tired guard. “I’m learn­ing. I’ve been learn­ing. I will con­tinue to learn. I just want to win, though. I can’t say it enough.</p>
    <p>“An­dre (Iguo­dala) com­ing to me: ‘Yo, win the game’. Go­ran (Dragic): ‘Win the game’. Dun­can (Robin­son): ‘Win the game’. And it’s not about just scor­ing – it’s about guard­ing, it’s about mak­ing the right play, get­ting the 50-50 ball. That’s all part of win­ning the game.”</p>
    <p>The all-round de­fen­sive ef­fort by the Heat al­lowed But­ler to flour­ish and smoth­ered reign­ing Most Valu­able Player Gian­nis An­te­tok­oun­mpo, whose 18 points was his low­est since he was held to 12 in Game 3 of the East Fi­nals last year.</p>
    <p>Mi­ami are 5-0 in the post-sea­son, but the Greek for­ward is con­vinced his team, who were sim­i­larly shocked in the open­ing game against the Or­lando Magic only to win the first-round se­ries 4-1, can bounce back in Game 2 to­day.</p>
    <p>“We’ve been here be­fore,” he said. “Go­ing down against Or­lando. We did the same thing last year against Bos­ton (Celtics).</p>
    <p>“We’ve got to come out and play Game 2, man. It’s a big game. Our sea­son is on the line. We’ve got to play hard, watch the tape, make the ad­just­ment, be ag­gres­sive, make the right play and hope­fully, we can win the game.”</p>
    <p>NO LET­TING UP I’m learn­ing. I’ve been learn­ing. I will con­tinue to learn. I just want to ’’ win, though. I can’t say it enough. JIMMY BUT­LER, Mi­ami Heat for­ward, on how he is adapt­ing to the team since ar­riv­ing from the Philadel­phia 76ers last sum­mer.</p>
