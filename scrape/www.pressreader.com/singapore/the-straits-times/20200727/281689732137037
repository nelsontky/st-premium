    <p>Two of the four new im­ported Covid-19 cases an­nounced yes­ter­day were a Sin­ga­porean and a per­ma­nent res­i­dent (PR) who re­turned to Sin­ga­pore from In­done­sia last Fri­day, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) said.</p>
    <p>One is a 30-year-old woman PR and the other is a one-year-old boy, who is a Sin­ga­pore cit­i­zen. MOH did not say if they were re­lated.</p>
    <p>The other two cases are work per­mit hold­ers who ar­rived from the Philip­pines on July 14.</p>
    <p>All four were placed on 14-day stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and tested while they were serv­ing their no­tices.</p>
    <p>There were five com­mu­nity cases re­ported yes­ter­day, com­pris­ing one work pass holder and four work per­mit hold­ers. MOH said all five cases are asymp­to­matic and were de­tected through proac­tive test­ing.</p>
    <p>Of the five, two are linked to pre­vi­ous cases or clus­ters, hav­ing been iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ously con­firmed cases and placed on quar­an­tine ear­lier.</p>
    <p>The other three are cur­rently un­linked, and were de­tected as a re­sult of MOH’s pe­ri­odic screen­ing of work­ers in es­sen­tial ser­vices who are stay­ing out­side dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>Epi­demi­o­log­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tions of the un­linked cases are in progress.</p>
    <p>There were 481 new coronaviru­s cases con­firmed as of noon yes­ter­day, bring­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 50,369. Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 472 new cases.</p>
    <p>Of the new cases, 98 per cent are linked to known clus­ters while the rest are pend­ing con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Gi­ant Hyper­mar­ket in Pioneer Mall in Jurong West Street 61, Mustafa Cen­tre and City Square Mall were added to a list of places vis­ited by Covid-19 pa­tients while they were still in­fec­tious.</p>
    <p>Tekka Cen­tre and Fu­nan Mall were also new ad­di­tions on the list, which can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 pa­tients vis­ited to get those who were there to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>MOH has said close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid th­ese places as they would have been cleaned, if needed.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from an av­er­age of 10 cases per day two weeks ago to seven in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has also de­creased from an av­er­age of five cases per day two weeks ago to four in the past week.</p>
    <p>With 169 cases dis­charged from hos­pi­tals or com­mu­nity iso­la­tion fa­cil­i­ties yes­ter­day, 45,506 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 173 pa­tients re­main in hospi­tal, with none in the in­ten­sive care unit, while 4,648 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions,</p>
    <p>To­tal dis­charged: 45,506 Dis­charged yes­ter­day:</p>
    <p>TO­TAL CASES: 50,369 while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>Glob­ally, the virus out­break, which be­gan in De­cem­ber last year, has in­fected more than 16 mil­lion peo­ple. More than 649,000 peo­ple have died. and com­mon fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>As a pre­cau­tion­ary mea­sure, SMRT has closed off the can­teen and staff lounge at the trans­port hub for thor­ough clean­ing and dis­in­fec­tion, said the LTA spokesman, who added that the risk of trans­mis­sion from tran­sient con­tact such as com­mut­ing on public trans­port is as­sessed to be low.</p>
    <p>The spokesman said: “We have also re­it­er­ated to all public trans­port op­er­a­tors the need to con­tinue to en­force strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures for public trans­port work­ers, which in­clude spaced seat­ing and stag­gered break times.</p>
    <p>“If they are un­well, they should seek med­i­cal at­ten­tion im­me­di­ately and re­main at home.”</p>
    <p>LTA re­it­er­ated that all com­muters are re­quired to wear masks when tak­ing public trans­port, and that they should also re­frain from talk­ing on public trans­port, prac­tise good per­sonal hy­giene and avoid tak­ing public trans­port if they are un­well. 169</p>
