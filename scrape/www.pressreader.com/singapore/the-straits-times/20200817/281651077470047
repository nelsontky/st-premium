    <p>At 62, Mr Ray­mond Leong is not look­ing to re­tire.</p>
    <p>This is de­spite fac­ing an emo­tional few weeks after he was re­trenched in late Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The for­mer se­nior sales man­ager used to work for a cruise and events com­pany. But about 11/ years after</p>
    <p>2 he joined the firm, he was told that he would be laid off due to the im­pact of the Covid-19 pan­demic on the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>“By the mid­dle of Fe­bru­ary, clients started can­celling or post­pon­ing events, and ac­tiv­ity was more or less dead,” said Mr Leong, adding that like many other firms in the tourism in­dus­try, the com­pany was hit badly by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Re­count­ing the ex­pe­ri­ence of be­ing laid off, he said: “When they told me, I didn’t re­act. In fact, it was my im­me­di­ate boss who burst into tears, and my col­leagues were in shock.”</p>
    <p>While he packed up his be­long­ings and was out of the of­fice in 30 min­utes be­cause he did not want to cause a scene, he spent the next month cry­ing him­self to sleep once the re­al­ity of the sit­u­a­tion set in.</p>
    <p>“I felt I was treated un­fairly, and I kept think­ing, ‘Why me?’ It felt per­sonal,” said Mr Leong, adding that to his knowl­edge, he was the only per­son laid off by the com­pany.</p>
    <p>Mr Leong, who lives alone, has spent more than 30 years in the tourism and travel in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Now, he hits the road ev­ery morn­ing at 6.30am as a Grab driver and usu­ally works a 12-hour shift.</p>
    <p>He can make up to $180 “on a good day”, but hopes to still use his years of ex­pe­ri­ence in the travel in­dus­try to do some­thing more.</p>
    <p>“I have learnt to let it go. But I am still look­ing for work part-time,” said Mr Leong, who has been ac­tively searching for job op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>He even ap­plied to be a tem­per­a­ture taker for an or­gan­i­sa­tion but was re­jected be­cause of his age.</p>
    <p>“I think that some peo­ple just look at the CV, they might say, ‘oh he is too old’, and they might not give me a chance,” said Mr Leong, who works out in the gym al­most ev­ery day. “It is tough, but I am try­ing to be pos­i­tive and open about it.”</p>
    <p>“You need to come to terms with the re­al­ity of re­trench­ment be­cause Covid-19 has cre­ated un­prece­dented times,” he added.</p>
