    <p>As the bat­tle with dengue con­tin­ues, more own­ers of build­ings and premises are turn­ing to fog­ging as part of dengue con­trol ef­forts.</p>
    <p>In re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times (ST), the Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) said there was a 82 per cent rise in the num­ber of fog­ging op­er­a­tions here between May and June this year, com­pared to the two-month pe­riod from Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>The agency also said it was no­ti­fied of 38,300 fog­ging ex­er­cises via the e-fog­ging sub­mis­sion sys­tem in the three months between April and June this year.</p>
    <p>The in­crease co­in­cided with the start of the spike in dengue cases in the cur­rent out­break, the agency added in a state­ment on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>A record high of 1,671 cases were re­ported in a sin­gle week in Sin­ga­pore early this month.</p>
    <p>Last week was the sixth con­sec­u­tive week that the num­ber of weekly dengue cases in Sin­ga­pore ex­ceeded 1,000.</p>
    <p>But while there is more fog­ging now, ex­perts are not so clear if it ac­tu­ally helps.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Ooi Eng Eong said there is “no solid and con­sis­tent ev­i­dence” that fog­ging works to bring the num­ber of dengue cases down even in ar­eas where there are clus­ters. The deputy di­rec­tor of the emerg­ing in­fec­tious dis­eases pro­gramme at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School added: “What is clear, how­ever, is that if the num­ber of Aedes mos­quito breed­ing sites can be elim­i­nated, the mos­quito pop­u­la­tion and in­ci­dence of dengue cases will cor­re­spond­ingly shrink.</p>
    <p>“We should all thus take steps to pre­vent Aedes breed­ing in­stead of plac­ing hopes on mos­quito fog­ging to re­duce the risk of dengue.”</p>
    <p>Mr De­clan Ee, di­rec­tor of lo­cal pest con­trol com­pany Ikari Ser­vices, said fog­ging only kills mosquitoes pre­sent at that time, and also in­sects that prey on them. “Most of the time, the mosquitoes sim­ply move away to the neigh­bour­ing ar­eas (when you do fog­ging). There have been numer­ous aca­demic ar­ti­cles in which ex­perts have talked about the in­ef­fec­tive­ness,” said Mr Ee.</p>
    <p>In its re­ply to ST, NEA said that fog­ging should be “used ju­di­ciously, and not as a rou­tine mos­quito con­trol mea­sure”.</p>
    <p>“Fog­ging is not manda­tory, but is rec­om­mended where there is an in­creased pres­ence of adult mosquitoes, or ne­ces­si­tated by the need to elim­i­nate in­fec­tive mosquitoes im­me­di­ately dur­ing a dengue or other mos­quito-borne dis­ease out­break,” the agency added.</p>
    <p>There are other mea­sures such as lar­vi­cid­ing. Mr Ed­win Kwek of PestWerkz So­lu­tions said it con­sists of ap­ply­ing anti-malaria oil or sand gran­ules onto wa­ter sur­faces to kill ex­ist­ing lar­vae. “Peo­ple think that adult mosquitoes bite, but lar­vae don’t, so they do fog­ging. Some end-users also have the mind­set that when they see fog, then mos­quito con­trol is done. But you can’t re­ally con­trol adult mosquitoes, as with all fly­ing in­sects. You can con­trol lar­vae breed­ing, how­ever, by elim­i­nat­ing wa­ter sources, and if you can­not re­move wa­ter sources – lar­vi­cid­ing.”</p>
    <p>ST reached out to a num­ber of town coun­cils to ask how they are deal­ing with the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>Nee Soon Town Coun­cil said it con­sulted vec­tor con­trol spe­cial­ists on the ef­fec­tive­ness of fog­ging and was told it may do more harm than good. So the town coun­cil fo­cuses on pre­ven­tion mea­sures – such as adding oil to drains – and con­ducts weekly in­spec­tions in the es­tate as part of preven­tive mea­sures.</p>
    <p>“On top of that, our clean­ers check on po­ten­tial wa­ter pond­ing spots and clear off stag­nant wa­ter dur­ing their daily clean­ing,” a spokesman said, adding that Yishun has also been se­lected as one of the lo­ca­tions for the launch of the Project Wol­bachia field study.</p>
    <p>The study, in­tro­duced in Nee Soon East in April 2018 by NEA’s En­vi­ron­men­tal Health In­sti­tute, sees male Wol­bachia-Aedes mosquitoes re­leased around res­i­den­tial blocks and along com­mon cor­ri­dors.</p>
    <p>When th­ese re­leased male Wol­bachia-Aedes mosquitoes mate with ur­ban Aedes ae­gypti fe­males in the com­mu­nity, the re­sul­tant eggs do not hatch.</p>
    <p>Over time, this may re­duce the vi­a­bil­ity of Aedes ae­gypti eggs, and cut the ur­ban Aedes ae­gypti mos­quito pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>In May this year, NEA said that Project Wol­bachia has been suc­cess­ful in sup­press­ing more than 90 per cent of the ur­ban Aedes ae­gypti mos­quito pop­u­la­tion at the ex­ist­ing study sites in Yishun and Tampines towns, and has kept th­ese pop­u­la­tions at low dengue-risk lev­els for more than a year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Mr Ee said de­mand for mos­quito con­trol mea­sures, in­clud­ing fog­ging, were up 50 per cent last month com­pared to the same pe­riod last year. His ser­vices are in de­mand in res­i­den­tial ar­eas such as at con­dos and in­dus­trial build­ings.</p>
    <p>With more fog­ging ex­er­cises ex­pected, NEA re­it­er­ated that pest con­trol op­er­a­tors, man­ag­ing agents and premise own­ers are to pro­vide ad­vance no­tice to in­form the pub­lic of up­com­ing such op­er­a­tions, with­out ex­cep­tion.</p>
    <p>The agency em­pha­sised that fog­ging should be “used ju­di­ciously, and not as a rou­tine mos­quito con­trol mea­sure”.</p>
