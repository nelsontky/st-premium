    <p>BEI­JING • Chi­nese war drama The Eight Hun­dred has be­come the world’s top-gross­ing movie so far this year af­ter it over­took pre­vi­ous cham­pion Bad Boys For Life.</p>
    <p>Bad Boys For Life, the third in­stal­ment in the Bad Boys tril­ogy, was re­leased in Jan­uary and starred Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.</p>
    <p>The Eight Hun­dred, which was re­leased in China on Aug 21, earned more than 2.91 bil­lion yuan (S$590 mil­lion) as of Mon­day, sur­pass­ing Bad Boys For Life’s US$425 mil­lion (S$580 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>The Eight Hun­dred is be­lieved to be the first Chi­nese-lan­guage film to top the global box of­fice.</p>
    <p>The movie is also show­ing in cin­e­mas in Sin­ga­pore and has grossed more than $242,000 as of Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Di­rected by Guan Hu, who is best known for the 2015 film Mr Six, The Eight Hun­dred is based on true sto­ries and de­picts the Chi­nese sol­diers’ de­fence of a ware­house against the in­vad­ing Ja­panese army dur­ing the Bat­tle of Shang­hai in 1937.</p>
    <p>De­spite be­ing out­num­bered and out­gunned by the en­emy, a bat­tal­ion of around 400 sol­diers, dubbed The Eight Hun­dred He­roes, held out against nu­mer­ous waves of Ja­panese forces for four days and four nights.</p>
    <p>“The Eight Hun­dred is ul­ti­mately about a na­tion and its peo­ple com­ing to­gether dur­ing a time of un­prece­dented cri­sis,” said Guan, 52, in a press re­lease. “It’s a univer­sal story that has a re­newed rel­e­vance in these cur­rent times.”</p>
    <p>The movie, with a pro­duc­tion cost of more than 550 mil­lion yuan, starred ac­tors such as Wang Qianyuan, Jiang Wu and Zhang Yi.</p>
    <p>The Eight Hun­dred, shot en­tirely with Imax cam­eras, is China’s first ma­jor theatri­cal re­lease since lo­cal cin­e­mas re­opened in July fol­low­ing months of clo­sure due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese movie-tick­et­ing and film data plat­form Maoyan es­ti­mated that The Eight Hun­dred will gross more than three bil­lion yuan af­ter it ends its run in China.</p>
    <p>The film cur­rently boasts a rat­ing of 9.2 points out of 10 on Maoyan and a rat­ing of 7.7 on Douban, a re­view plat­form.</p>
    <p>The Eight Hun­dred hit the big screen in lim­ited theatri­cal re­lease in North Amer­ica late last month and was re­leased in Bri­tain last Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The film cur­rently ranked ninth on the Chi­nese box of­fice chart which cov­ered all films screened in China, ac­cord­ing to data com­piled by the China Movie Data In­for­ma­tion Net­work.</p>
    <p>The 2017 block­buster Wolf War­rior 2, star­ring Wu Jing, cur­rently topped the Chi­nese chart with 5.69 bil­lion yuan.</p>
