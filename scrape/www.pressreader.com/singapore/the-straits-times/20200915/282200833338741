    <p>Busi­nesses in­volved in dis­putes with Ja­panese com­pa­nies dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic can re­solve them more cost ef­fec­tively and quickly through a new me­di­a­tion ser­vice started by the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Me­di­a­tion Cen­tre (SIMC) and its coun­ter­part in Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>Un­der the joint pro­to­col launched last Satur­day, com­pa­nies will have ac­cess to me­di­a­tion at fees start­ing from $6,500 and capped at $16,000 per party, re­gard­less of the value in dis­pute.</p>
    <p>This costs less than other forms of dis­pute res­o­lu­tion – such as ar­bi­tra­tion and lit­i­ga­tion – which typ­i­cally run to six fig­ures.</p>
    <p>The me­di­a­tion will also be or­gan­ised within 10 days, with SIMC and the Ja­pan In­ter­na­tional Me­di­a­tion Cen­tre (JIMC) each pro­vid­ing a me­di­a­tor to bridge the le­gal and cul­tural dif­fer­ences be­tween the par­ties.</p>
    <p>Set­tle­ment agree­ments aris­ing from the me­di­a­tion may be en­forced un­der the Sin­ga­pore Con­ven­tion on Me­di­a­tion, which came into force last Satur­day in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The United Na­tions treaty has also been rat­i­fied by five other coun­tries – Fiji, Qatar, Saudi Ara­bia, Belarus and Ecuador.</p>
    <p>The joint pro­to­col comes on the back of con­cerns that dis­putes aris­ing from dis­rup­tions re­lated to Covid-19 should be re­solved quickly in the in­ter­ests of busi­ness and eco­nomic re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>It fol­lows a sim­i­lar pro­to­col launched in Sin­ga­pore by SIMC ear­lier this year, the SIMC Covid-19 Pro­to­col.</p>
    <p>SIMC said it is also work­ing with part­ners around the world on sim­i­lar pro­to­cols that will be cus­tomised to the needs of the spe­cific ju­ris­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>With Ja­pan and Sin­ga­pore among each other’s largest in­vestors, the two coun­tries share ex­ten­sive busi­ness ties.</p>
    <p>In a state­ment, SIMC said the pro­to­col was the first tie-up of its kind be­tween two in­ter­na­tional cen­tres.</p>
    <p>SIMC chair­man Ge­orge Lim said: “The joint pro­to­col of­fers par­ties the best of both worlds as they can dis­cuss their dis­putes with me­di­a­tors who un­der­stand the unique as­pects of their re­spec­tive cul­tures and ju­ris­dic­tions.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, chief di­rec­tor of JIMC Haruo Okada said the pan­demic has caused “dis­rup­tions and con­flicts all over the world that no one has ever ex­pe­ri­enced” and for which there are no ap­pli­ca­ble rules and prece­dents, mak­ing such dis­putes par­tic­u­larly suitable for me­di­a­tion.</p>
