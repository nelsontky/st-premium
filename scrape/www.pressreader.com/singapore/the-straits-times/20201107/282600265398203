    <p>More than 100 mid-ca­reer work­ers have been suc­cess­fully placed in com­pany at­tach­ments as at the end of last month, with around a quar­ter of them be­ing ma­ture work­ers, said Work­force Sin­ga­pore (WSG) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>More than 2,100 host or­gan­i­sa­tions have also stepped up to of­fer mid-ca­reer work­ers about 10,600 com­pany at­tach­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties as at the end of last month.</p>
    <p>Roles are across di­verse sec­tors, and in­clude in­vest­ment bank­ing an­a­lyst, graphic de­signer, acous­tic en­gi­neer, re­la­tion­ship con­sul­tant, cus­tomer ser­vice ex­pe­ri­ence of­fi­cer, learn­ing ex­pe­ri­ence ex­ec­u­tive, con­tent cre­ator and fi­nance an­a­lyst.</p>
    <p>The at­tach­ments come un­der the SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme, which was launched in Au­gust to help mid-ca­reer work­ers build use­ful skills as a step to­wards per­ma­nent jobs.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme is run by Work­force Sin­ga­pore to­gether with its pro­gramme man­ager, the Sin­ga­pore Busi­ness Fed­er­a­tion.</p>
    <p>WSG said: “Tak­ing that first step into un­fa­mil­iar ter­ri­tory, es­pe­cially for ma­ture mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als, is not easy, and we would like to en­cour­age more mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als to come on board the pro­gramme.”</p>
    <p>Mr Chan Kien Teck, chief ex­ec­u­tive of elec­tron­ics dis­trib­u­tor MEDs Tech­nolo­gies, one of the firms un­der the pro­gramme, said mid-ca­reer work­ers bring with them di­verse ex­pe­ri­ences, dif­fer­ent back­grounds and ex­po­sure to var­i­ous in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>“They have some of the best prac­tices f rom their pre­vi­ous work or­gan­i­sa­tions, and by in­ject­ing them into ours, they help en­rich us all.”</p>
    <p>He called it a win-win sit­u­a­tion for em­ploy­ers and job seek­ers look­ing for a change.</p>
    <p>“It al­lows us to tap WSG’s re­sources to reach out to ex­pe­ri­enced job seek­ers, and with some train­ing in­ter­nally, help them un­der­stand our busi­ness. They will in turn be able to help us el­e­vate fur­ther,” he said.</p>
    <p>Semi­con­duc­tor firm Glob­alFoundrie­s also j oined the pro­gramme to find ad­di­tional sources of tal­ent to drive com­pany growth.</p>
    <p>“The com­pany needed more re­sources to meet the in­creas­ing op­er­a­tional de­mand and to build our lo­cal work­force as a core hu­man cap­i­tal,” said Ms Jan­ice Lee, the firm’s vice-pres­i­dent and hu­man re­source lead for in­ter­na­tional fab op­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“Many mid-ca­reer trainees may not pos­sess the spe­cific skill sets that we re­quire; how­ever, there are trans­fer­able skills and knowl­edge which they have gained through their past pro­fes­sional em­ploy­ments. These ex­pe­ri­enced work­ers may also bring di­verse and fresh per­spec­tives into the way things could be done dif­fer­ently.”</p>
    <p>Even younger work­ers can ben­e­fit from the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Mr Mar­cus Lim, 28, who is a sales op­er­a­tions trainee at MEDs Tech­nolo­gies, said the pro­gramme is an op­por­tu­nity for him to switch out of his pre­vi­ous role do­ing sales in the fi­nance in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“(This pro­gramme) is an op­por­tu­nity for us to pre­pare our­selves for the fu­ture and to build as much ex­pe­ri­ence as we can for now. When the econ­omy re­cov­ers, we will be ready. I see this as a chance to gain more ex­pe­ri­ence and learn new skills.”</p>
