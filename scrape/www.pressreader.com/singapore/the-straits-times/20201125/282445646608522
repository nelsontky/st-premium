    <p>Ar­gentina will not have the el­e­ment of sur­prise on their side i n New­cas­tle on Satur­day when they try to re­peat their shock Tri-Na­tions win over New Zealand, All Blacks as­sis­tant coach John Plumtree has said.</p>
    <p>The Pu­mas pro­duced a su­perb de­fen­sive ef­fort to record a his­toric 25-15 vic­tory two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>That de­feat came af­ter New Zealand had lost 24-22 to Aus­tralia the week be­fore, with the back-to­back re­ver­sals putting the heat on new coach Ian Fos­ter and staff.</p>
    <p>The All Blacks have not lost three suc­ces­sive Tests since 1998, when they dropped five in a row.</p>
    <p>The Pu­mas fol­lowed up their first win over New Zealand with a 15-15 draw against the Wal­la­bies last week, when they seemed content to al­low the Aus­tralians to play all the rugby and put them un­der pres­sure to earn kick­able penal­ties.</p>
    <p>“We know what the Ar­gen­tini­ans are all about now,” Plumtree told re­porters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We’ve seen them play twice, and we’ll see how we get on against them in the week­end.”</p>
    <p>The All Blacks were heav­ily crit­i­cised for a lack of pen­e­tra­tion in their back­line against the Pu­mas in Syd­ney on Nov 14, and seemed un­will­ing or un­able to change their game plan to get through their op­po­nents’ sti­fling de­fence.</p>
    <p>“When the All Blacks get beaten it’s when de­fences dom­i­nate our at­tack,” Plumtree said.</p>
    <p>“We do see op­por­tu­ni­ties, but we’ve got to be good enough to take those op­por­tu­ni­ties and see that space and look to get the ball to that space.</p>
    <p>“That’s not just run­ning the ball, it’s also kick­ing and ap­ply­ing pres­sure in dif­fer­ent parts of the game.”</p>
    <p>He sug­gested there might be some changes to per­son­nel on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>Loose for­wards Akira Ioane and Hoskins So­tutu are look­ing the most likely to get the nod with the side need­ing more phys­i­cal­ity and both play­ers im­press­ing in their op­por­tu­ni­ties so far.</p>
    <p>He also said that the All Blacks are be­ing de­lib­er­ately pro­voked dur­ing prac­tice to im­prove their dis­ci­pline ahead of the clash.</p>
    <p>“We’ve put a big fo­cus on it dur­ing train­ing, putting play­ers un­der pres­sure,” Plumtree said.</p>
    <p>“Fozzie (Fos­ter) has been work­ing re­ally hard on coming up with some cre­ative games where po­ten­tially the play­ers might get a lit­tle bit up­set with some of his de­ci­sions, par­tic­u­larly on ref­er­ee­ing.”</p>
    <p>He added that the play­ers had “come a long way” in con­tain­ing their emo­tions on the pitch and help­ing one another re­main calm.</p>
