    <p>If this vac­cine doesn’t work, our health could be at risk. But if it works, I will be the first to ben­e­fit... Ev­ery­body ben­e­fits.</p>
    <p>When the call for In­done­sian vol­un­teers to test a po­ten­tial vac­cine against Covid-19 was sounded in July, mo­tor­cy­cle-taxi driver Fadly Barjadi Kusuma and seven fam­ily mem­bers signed up for the trial with­out hes­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Fadly and his wife, Ms Mira Nu­rani, both 32, passed the health screen­ing and were deemed el­i­gi­ble to take part in the late-stage clin­i­cal hu­man trial.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine in ques­tion is be­ing de­vel­oped by Si­no­vac Biotech, a pri­vate Chi­nese phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firm. The com­pany is also tri­alling the vac­cine in other coun­tries, in­clud­ing Brazil and Turkey.</p>
    <p>Ms Mira’s three sis­ters and an­other rel­a­tive also signed up for the trial. While they do not re­side un­der one roof, they live close to one an­other in Ban­dung, which is a 21/ hour drive from Jakarta.</p>
    <p>Mr Fadly’s sis­ter and mother-in­law, how­ever, did not make the cut due to high blood pres­sure.</p>
    <p>Mr Fadly told The Straits Times that he and his fam­ily hope a vac­cine will be found soon.</p>
    <p>“Be­ing a trial vol­un­teer means help­ing ev­ery­one to fight the virus,” he said. “If this vac­cine doesn’t work, our health could be at risk. But if it works, I will be the first to ben­e­fit. Oth­ers will also ben­e­fit. Ev­ery­body ben­e­fits.”</p>
    <p>Ms Mira said she signed up a week af­ter Mr Fadly took his first dose on Aug 11 and showed no neg­a­tive symp­toms. She was also per­suaded by her sis­ter, who had vol­un­teered in a vac­cine trial for the H5N1 avian in­fluenza – also known as bird flu – around a decade ago.</p>
    <p>“We are priv­i­leged to be able to get the vac­cines ear­lier than oth­ers. I hope to help oth­ers by join­ing,” the laun­dry at­ten­dant told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>“When I signed up, many peo­ple I know also did the same. That fur­ther en­cour­aged me,” she added.</p>
    <p>In In­done­sia, Si­no­vac Biotech has teamed up with state-owned phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pany Bio Farma to carry out the late-stage trial. This is the fi­nal step for get­ting reg­u­la­tory ap­proval from BPOM, the In­done­sian food and drug au­thor­ity. Pad­jad­jaran Univer­sity in Ban­dung is as­sist­ing in the trial.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials say they are tar­get­ing to vac­ci­nate around 160 mil­lion peo­ple – out of a pop­u­la­tion of 270 mil­lion – to achieve “herd im­mu­nity”.</p>
    <p>Mr Fadly said it would be bet­ter to be vac­ci­nated early rather than wait in a queue of tens of mil­lions of peo­ple later.</p>
    <p>“When the vac­cine is fi­nally found, just in my city of Ban­dung, thou­sands would queue for it, and who knows whether we would have to pay for it,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I am prone to catch­ing the coro­n­avirus. I need self-de­fence. A vac­cine will help me.”</p>
    <p>NO NEG­A­TIVE SYMP­TOMS</p>
    <p>Mr Fadly re­ceived his first vac­ci­na­tion on Aug 11, and the next one two weeks later.</p>
    <p>“The first in­jec­tion made me so drowsy that I felt like I hadn’t slept well for days,” he re­called. “I went</p>
    <p>to bed at 5pm. This has never hap­pened be­fore as I am a night owl.”</p>
    <p>The se­cond shot left him with a headache and a sore arm.</p>
    <p>“I took parac­eta­mol, and the symp­toms went away. The headache was prob­a­bly due to fa­tigue. I con­tin­ued work­ing even af­ter the vac­ci­na­tions,” he said. Ms Mira’s ex­pe­ri­ence was bet­ter. All she felt was the prick of the nee­dle, and the se­cond vac­ci­na­tion just en­hanced her ap­petite.</p>
    <p>“My ap­petite surged for three days. Then, ev­ery­thing went back to nor­mal,” she said.</p>
    <p>It has been two months since, and all the fam­ily mem­bers have not had any neg­a­tive re­ac­tion to the vac­ci­na­tions.</p>
    <p>“I feel fine. I sleep and eat nor­mally... no cough­ing,” Mr Fadly said.</p>
    <p>OVER­COM­ING INI­TIAL FEARS, COM­BAT­ING OSTRACISM</p>
    <p>Many of Mr Fadly’s friends ad­mon­ished him for tak­ing part in the clin­i­cal trial. They told him he was a fool for putting his life on the line.</p>
    <p>Vol­un­teers are not paid. Their</p>
    <p>only re­im­burse­ment is for trans­port fares to the Ban­dung lab­o­ra­tory. In Mr Fadly’s case, this is a 30-minute drive from home.</p>
    <p>“They called me ‘stupid’. They said, ‘What if you die be­cause of the vac­cine?’ I told them, ‘If I die, it is not your busi­ness.’”</p>
    <p>Some of his friends had even mis­tak­enly be­lieved he had caught the dis­ease and os­tracised him.</p>
    <p>“They think I am get­ting vac­ci­nated be­cause I am sick. I told them if it were true, then they could have just vac­ci­nated pa­tients at the hospi­tal, not me,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Fadly, who has three chil­dren be­tween four months and six years old, ad­mit­ted that he ini­tially had doubts. “Cer­tainly I was scared... about get­ting some­thing (for­eign) in­jected into my body.”</p>
    <p>But he found com­fort in know­ing that he was not the only vol­un­teer in In­done­sia – or in the world, for that mat­ter – to be tak­ing part in Covid-19 vac­cine tri­als.</p>
    <p>“A lot of peo­ple are overly wor­ried be­cause they do not know much about it. They watch TV but do not probe deeper,” he added.</p>
    <p>Dr Achmad Yurianto, a se­nior of­fi­cial at the Health Min­istry, said that in gen­eral, “safety is very much guar­an­teed” in late-stage clin­i­cal tri­als. “If it weren’t safe, we wouldn’t have gone ahead with phase three,” he told a Covid-19 we­bi­nar on Oct 19, in a re­sponse to a query by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>HOP­ING FOR THE BEST</p>
    <p>It will take an­other four months be­fore Mr Fadly and his fam­ily un­dergo their fi­nal screen­ing, which will mark the trial’s com­ple­tion. He and fel­low vol­un­teers will have an in­terim health screen­ing, in­volv­ing blood tests, on Nov 24.</p>
    <p>Ev­ery month, they re­ceive a phone call from testers ask­ing af­ter their health and gen­eral well­be­ing.</p>
    <p>Be­sides ob­serv­ing the usual Covid-19 health pro­to­cols, in­clud­ing wear­ing a mask, wash­ing their hands fre­quently and keep­ing a safe dis­tance from oth­ers, they are also barred from leav­ing Ban­dung.</p>
    <p>“We are be­ing closely mon­i­tored. We are not sup­posed to take any med­i­ca­tion that could weaken our im­mune sys­tem,” he said.</p>
    <p>But oth­er­wise, they are able to go about their daily rou­tines as usual.</p>
    <p>“There are no other spe­cial mea­sures. They (testers) told us to con­tinue with nor­mal ac­tiv­i­ties. We can con­tinue to work,” he added.</p>
    <p>Fel­low vol­un­teers have set up a sup­port net­work in the form of a What­sApp group so they can com­mu­ni­cate with one an­other.</p>
    <p>It is too early to say whether the vac­cine is work­ing as hoped.</p>
    <p>Ms Mira said: “We leave it to God. We just say ‘ bis­mil­lah’ (in the name of God).”</p>
    <p>Mr Fadly added: “At least if any­thing hap­pens to me, if I die, I will have died try­ing to help oth­ers. I will die a mar­tyr.”</p>
    <p>MR FADLY BARJADI KUSUMA, a mo­tor­cy­cle-taxi driver and one of the vac­cine vol­un­teers from a fam­ily in Ban­dung.</p>
    <p>They called me ‘stupid’. They said, ‘What if you die be­cause of the vac­cine?’ I told them, ‘If I die, it is not your busi­ness.’</p>
    <p>MR FADLY, say­ing that his friends ad­mon­ished him for tak­ing part in the clin­i­cal trial.</p>
    <p>If it weren’t safe, we wouldn’t have gone ahead with phase three.</p>
