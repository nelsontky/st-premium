    <p>The bat­tered re­tail sec­tor has claimed an­other ca­su­alty with Ja­panese de­part­ment store op­er­a­tor Ise­tan Sin­ga­pore sink­ing into the red for the half year.</p>
    <p>It racked up a net l oss of $317,000 for the three months to June 30, com­pared with a net profit of $1.6 mil­lion in the same pe­riod a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>This was mainly due to a de­cline in sales as well as im­pair­ment losses on fi­nan­cial as­sets, the com­pany said on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Loss per share stood at 0.77 cent for the six months ver­sus earn­ings per share of 3.82 cents a year ear­lier.</p>
    <p>Rev­enue fell 39.6 per cent to $34 mil­lion, due to lower sales of goods from the re­tail seg­ment, re­duced con­sign­ment in­come and de­clin­ing rental i ncome from its Ise­tan Wisma Atria in­vest­ment prop­erty.</p>
    <p>The de­crease was mainly due to the clo­sure of de­part­ment stores from April 7 to June 18, the im­pact the pan­demic had on the re­tail in­dus­try and dis­con­tin­ued op­er­a­tions for its Jurong East store in March, noted Ise­tan.</p>
    <p>No div­i­dend was de­clared, un­changed from last year.</p>
    <p>Ise­tan said the re­tail en­vi­ron­ment re­mains “very chal­leng­ing” and that a ma­te­rial re­cov­ery is not ex­pected this year.</p>
    <p>None­the­less, the Ise­tan Scotts ren­o­va­tion project is on track for com­ple­tion this year, and the firm re­mains “cau­tiously op­ti­mistic” that this will con­trib­ute to its rev­enue upon com­ple­tion.</p>
    <p>Ise­tan shares closed un­changed at $2.96 yes­ter­day.</p>
