    <p>WASH­ING­TON • The US econ­omy showed more signs that the re­cov­ery is stalling as Covid-19 cases surge and more busi­nesses are forced to close, adding a dis­ap­point­ing 245,000 new j obs last month, the gov­ern­ment re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>And while the Labour Depart­ment data showed the un­em­ploy­ment rate dipped to 6.7 per cent from 6.9 per cent, the low­est since the pan­demic struck, 10.7 mil­lion work­ers re­main un­em­ployed.</p>
    <p>The ranks of long-term un­em­ployed – those job­less for 27 weeks or more – rose by 385,000 to 3.9 mil­lion, and more Amer­i­cans left the work­force en­tirely, the re­port said, as the par­tic­i­pa­tion rate dipped two-tenths to 61.5 per cent.</p>
    <p>The con­sen­sus es­ti­mate was for a gain of 650,000 po­si­tions last month, but many econ­o­mists warned the re­sult could come in much lower, given signs that hir­ing had slowed last month as the coro­n­avirus re­turned with a vengeance.</p>
    <p>That was re­flected in the loss of nearly 35,000 re­tail jobs in Novem­ber. And as mostly lower-wage po­si­tions fall vic­tim to the pan­demic, av­er­age hourly earn­ings rose slightly to US$29.58 (S$39.40), ac­cord­ing to the re­port.</p>
    <p>Gov­ern­ment em­ploy­ment fell by 99,000, largely due to lay­offs of tem­po­rary cen­sus work­ers, while pri­vate hir­ing rose by 344,000, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of tem­po­rary lay­offs dropped by 441,000 to 2.8 mil­lion, but that is two mil­lion higher than the pre-pan­demic level.</p>
    <p>The data raises the chances that Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den will in­herit an even weaker labour mar­ket next year, with the re­cov­ery at risk of stalling dur­ing the wait for wide­spread vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion. With al­most four mil­lion Amer­i­cans en­dur­ing long-term job­less­ness, the re­port may also help push Congress to pass new fis­cal aid by year-end and could make Fed­eral Re­serve of­fi­cials more in­clined to pro­vide new stim­u­lus when they meet from Dec 15 to 16.</p>
    <p>US stock fu­tures pared their in­crease af­ter the re­port, while 10-year Trea­sury yields ex­tended gains and the dol­lar fluc­tu­ated. “You are see­ing the im­pact of the pan­demic surge here,” Mr Jef­frey Rosen­berg, a se­nior port­fo­lio man­ager at Black­Rock, said on Bloomberg Tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“The mar­ket re­ac­tion is re­ally look­ing through this to the pol­icy re­sponse.”</p>
    <p>The em­ploy­ment re­port is a mid­month snap­shot, so jobs lost amid new re­stric­tions and lock­downs put into place in the weeks since will not be re­flected un­til De­cem­ber’s data.</p>
    <p>The shift to on­line shop­ping this hol­i­day sea­son was es­pe­cially ev­i­dent in the data.</p>
    <p>Trans­porta­tion and ware­hous­ing added 145,000 work­ers – the most since 1997 – while re­tail em­ploy­ment fell by 34,700, re­flect­ing less sea­sonal hir­ing than nor­mal in some sec­tors. Leisure and hos­pi­tal­ity jobs rose by 31,000 fol­low­ing a 270,000 gain in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Though ef­fec­tive vac­cines could be rolled out as soon as this month, eco­nomic head­winds are likely to keep mount­ing be­fore Mr Bi­den’s Jan 20 inau­gu­ra­tion.</p>
