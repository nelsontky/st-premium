    <p>PHILADEL­PHIA • US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has said that a vac­cine against the deadly coro­n­avirus could be three or four weeks away, despite cau­tion sounded by some Amer­i­can pub­lic health of­fi­cials over the ac­cel­er­ated time­line.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, speak­ing at a town hall meet­ing hosted by ABC News in Philadel­phia on Tues­day, de­fended his han­dling of the Covid-19 cri­sis, and said a vac­cine could be ready for dis­tri­bu­tion before the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>“We’re very close to hav­ing a vac­cine,” he said. “If you want to know the truth, the pre­vi­ous ad­min­is­tra­tion would have taken per­haps years to have a vac­cine be­cause of the FDA (Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion) and all the ap­provals. And we’re within weeks of get­ting it... Could be three weeks, four weeks.”</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, top US in­fec­tious dis­ease ex­pert An­thony Fauci told CNN most ex­perts be­lieve a vac­cine will be ready by Novem­ber or De­cem­ber. Other ex­perts said a sci­en­tif­i­cally cred­i­ble vac­cine will not be avail­able un­til early next year.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump bris­tled at tough ques­tions at the meet­ing, ar­gu­ing that his de­ci­sion to im­pose travel bans on China and Europe had saved thou­sands, if not mil­lions, of lives.</p>
    <p>The United States has re­ported nearly 6.6 mil­lion Covid-19 cases, the high­est num­ber world­wide, and nearly 195,000 deaths. That ac­counts for 20 per cent of the cases world­wide, though the US has just 4 per cent of the world’s pop­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump had said the num­ber was due to the US con­duct­ing more test­ing than other coun­tries. He had also said the virus would dis­ap­pear on its own.</p>
