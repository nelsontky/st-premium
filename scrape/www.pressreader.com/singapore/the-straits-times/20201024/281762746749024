    <p>While res­i­dents of Sin­ga­pore are the least wor­ried about con­tract­ing Covid-19 com­pared with peo­ple from five other South-east Asian coun­tries, they are also the most pes­simistic about an eco­nomic re­cov­ery, ac­cord­ing to a re­search sur­vey.</p>
    <p>The find­ings re­leased yes­ter­day show that more than half of 500 Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents in­di­cated they are less con­fi­dent about their job se­cu­rity than three months ear­lier – the high­est pro­por­tion ob­served com­pared with re­spon­dents from In­done­sia, Malaysia, the Philip­pines, Thai­land and Viet­nam.</p>
    <p>Only 27 per cent of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents are ex­pect­ing the econ­omy to im­prove in the next six months, mar­ket re­search firm Ip­sos said.</p>
    <p>Ip­sos con­ducted the on­line sur­vey from Sept 18 to 22, ask­ing re­spon­dents ques­tions re­lated to the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>They in­cluded how res­i­dents of the six South-east Asian coun­tries have adapted to Covid-19 re­stric­tions, as well as their house­hold in­come and spend­ing pat­terns.</p>
    <p>Five hun­dred peo­ple aged 18 and above – who Ip­sos said were na­tion­ally rep­re­sen­ta­tive in terms of age, gen­der and eth­nic­ity – were sur­veyed from each of the coun­tries.</p>
    <p>On the coro­n­avirus, 73 per cent of Sin­ga­pore re­spon­dents said they are ei­ther “very wor­ried” or “some­what wor­ried” about get­ting it.</p>
    <p>The coun­tries with the most num­ber of peo­ple wor­ried were the Philip­pines (95 per cent), and Viet­nam and Malaysia (both 93 per cent).</p>
    <p>But 56 per cent of Sin­ga­pore re­spon­dents said they are “less con­fi­dent” about job se­cu­rity for them­selves, their fam­i­lies or other peo­ple they know per­son­ally, com­pared with three months ear­lier.</p>
    <p>This is the high­est pro­por­tion among the coun­tries sur­veyed, which av­er­aged 49 per cent.</p>
    <p>When it came to eco­nomic re­cov­ery in the next six months, res­i­dents of In­done­sia are the most op­ti­mistic, with 75 per cent say­ing the econ­omy will be “some­what stronger” or “much stronger”.</p>
    <p>The fig­ure was 51 per cent for Viet­nam and 50 per cent for the Philip­pines, and only 27 per cent for Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>When asked what the pri­or­ity for the gov­ern­ment in the next six months should be, 32 per cent of Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents said “pro­tect­ing jobs”. This is more than in the other South-east Asian coun­tries such as Malaysia (20 per cent) or In­done­sia (13 per cent).</p>
    <p>The three other choices pre­sented to re­spon­dents for this ques­tion were: “con­trol prices of goods”, “pro­vide cash as­sis­tance to house­holds” and “keep ev­ery­one safe from Covid-19”.</p>
    <p>Mr Prasad Shinde, se­nior client of­fi­cer at Ip­sos in Sin­ga­pore, said Sin­ga­pore­ans are re­as­sured by the steps taken by the Gov­ern­ment in con­tain­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“They are, how­ever, more con­cerned about their job se­cu­rity and feel the Gov­ern­ment could do more in this area,” he added in the state­ment.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Mr Shinde noted that the pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the adop­tion of cash­less pay­ments in Sin­ga­pore and the re­gion.</p>
    <p>In gen­eral, 43 per cent more sur­vey re­spon­dents are buy­ing more items on­line, 42 per cent more peo­ple are us­ing cash­less pay­ments and 29 per cent more peo­ple are stream­ing more on­line con­tent.</p>
    <p>He said: “Such habits are likely to per­sist be­yond the pan­demic. Most brands and mar­keters are in the plan­ning stage for their busi­ness in 2021, and tak­ing note of th­ese changed habits in their plans for 2021 is im­por­tant.”</p>
