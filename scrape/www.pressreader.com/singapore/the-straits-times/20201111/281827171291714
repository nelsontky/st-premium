    <p>BRASILIA/MEX­ICO CITY • The pres­i­dents of Latin Amer­ica’s two largest coun­tries have held back from con­grat­u­lat­ing Mr Joe Bi­den on win­ning the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, even as other lead­ers of al­lied coun­tries around the globe sent their best wishes.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den, a Demo­crat, cleared the thresh­old of 270 elec­toral col­lege votes needed to win the pres­i­dency last Satur­day, af­ter four days of bal­lot count­ing fol­low­ing the Nov 3 elec­tion. In­cum­bent Repub­li­can Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump has yet to con­cede.</p>
    <p>Brazil’s right-wing Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro had boasted he would be the first leader in the world to con­grat­u­late Mr Trump, for whom he has ex­pressed ad­mi­ra­tion, on his re-elec­tion. But he has been silent on the mat­ter in re­cent days.</p>
    <p>In Mex­ico, left­ist Pres­i­dent An­dres Manuel Lopez Obrador re­it­er­ated that he would not recog­nise the elec­tion win­ner un­til le­gal dis­putes were re­solved, but said he had “no prob­lem” with Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump has launched an ar­ray of law­suits to press claims of elec­tion fraud, with­out pro­duc­ing ev­i­dence. State of­fi­cials have said they are not aware of any sig­nif­i­cant ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mr Lopez Obrador and Mr Bol­sonaro are part of a shrink­ing group of world lead­ers to not con­grat­u­late Mr Bi­den. They in­clude Rus­sia’s Vladimir Putin, China’s Xi Jin­ping and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, the lead­ers of US al­lies such as Bri­tain, Ja­pan, France, South Korea and Aus­tralia, as well as Sin­ga­pore, Malaysia, In­done­sia and Thai­land, have all con­grat­u­lated Mr Bi­den and his run­ning mate, Ms Ka­mala Har­ris.</p>
    <p>Mr Bol­sonaro’s si­lence could her­ald a rocky start in bi­lat­eral re­la­tions with Mr Bi­den, who is ex­pected to put Ama­zon de­for­esta­tion and hu­man rights at the top of his agenda with Brazil.</p>
    <p>“I think the Pres­i­dent is wait­ing for this im­broglio over fraud­u­lent votes to be re­solved: if there is noth­ing, he will give his view,” Brazil Vice-Pres­i­dent Hamil­ton Mourao told re­porters on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Lopez Obrador, who ac­cused his op­po­nents of elec­toral fraud dur­ing his un­suc­cess­ful 2006 and 2012 pres­i­den­tial bids, said he could not com­ment un­til the le­gal process was ex­hausted. “We have no dif­fer­ences with the Demo­cratic Party can­di­date, Mr Bi­den. No prob­lem with him.”</p>
