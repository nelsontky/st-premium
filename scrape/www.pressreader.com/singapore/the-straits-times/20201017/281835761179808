    <p>Umno’s lead­er­ship has de­manded a Cab­i­net reshuf­fle that ad­heres to the of­fi­cial hi­er­ar­chy in Malaysia’s largest rul­ing party, putting em­bat­tled Prime Min­is­ter Muhyid­din Yassin in a quandary over whether to ac­cede to the ul­ti­ma­tum that would mean ap­point­ing min­is­ters with graft cases hang­ing over their heads.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times has learnt that emis­saries, in­clud­ing Umno sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ah­mad Maslan, pre­sented their case to the Pre­mier on Wed­nes­day, af­ter the party’s po­lit­i­cal bureau chaired by pres­i­dent Ah­mad Zahid Hamidi de­cided on Tues­day it would set new con­di­tions in ex­change for its con­tin­ued sup­port for the</p>
    <p>Perikatan Na­sional (PN) gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>It would mean drop­ping up to four min­is­ters from Umno al­lied to Tan Sri Muhyid­din who are not in the once-dom­i­nant Malay party’s supreme coun­cil, and in­stead in­stalling lead­ers – in­clud­ing Zahid and Ah­mad – who are fac­ing cor­rup­tion charges or im­pli­cated in on­go­ing graft tri­als.</p>
    <p>“As Umno pres­i­dent, Zahid would have to be above vice-pres­i­dent Is­mail Sabri Yaakob, who is now Se­nior Min­is­ter – mean­ing Deputy Prime Min­is­ter,” said a rul­ing pact of­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>The Muhyid­din Cab­i­net has four se­nior min­is­ters but no deputy pre­mier, with Parti Pribumi Ber­satu Malaysia hav­ing 11 min­is­ters com­pared with Umno’s nine.</p>
    <p>When con­tacted on the pos­si­bil­ity of such a reshuf­fle, Ber­satu in­for­ma­tion chief Wan Sai­ful Wan Jan re­sponded that his pres­i­dent Muhyid­din has re­peat­edly stressed that “the party must up­hold a gov­ern­ment that is com­mit­ted to in­tegrity and unity among the Mus­lim faith­ful”.</p>
    <p>“The Cab­i­net can be made up of any qual­i­fied in­di­vid­u­als based on th­ese prin­ci­ples,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Mr Muhyid­din has re­lied on a di­vided Umno – whose schisms he has helped to widen – to keep him­self on top of Malaysian pol­i­tics since be­ing sworn in seven months ago.</p>
    <p>While there is a fac­tion – mostly made up of those who are en­joy­ing plum po­si­tions in gov­ern­ment – in Umno loyal to the Pre­mier, dis­sent at hav­ing to play sec­ond fid­dle among the rest of the party lead­er­ship has reached fever pitch.</p>
    <p>This comes amid a scramble for power af­ter Op­po­si­tion Leader An­war Ibrahim claimed on Tues­day fol­low­ing an au­di­ence with the King that he had the sup­port of more than 120 mem­bers of the 222-strong Par­lia­ment. How­ever, he has pro­vided no proof of this as­ser­tion.</p>
    <p>With other top fig­ures in the party gain­ing in­flu­ence, Zahid, a for­mer deputy pre­mier, has ag­i­tated for a shake-up of gov­ern­ment ahead of Umno lead­er­ship elec­tions sched­uled for next year.</p>
    <p>His weak­en­ing grip on the party was ev­i­denced by Fed­eral Ter­ri­to­ries Min­is­ter An­nuar Musa – a for­mer Umno sec­re­tary-gen­eral ap­pointed by Zahid – crit­i­cis­ing the quests for po­si­tions amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cial sources con­firm that Datuk Seri An­war pre­sented the palace with pledges of sup­port from party lead­ers in­clud­ing Zahid.</p>
    <p>Rul­ing pact sources re­vealed that Malaysia’s long­est-serv­ing law­maker, Tengku Raza­leigh Hamzah, has also thrown his hat into the ring.</p>
    <p>His ac­tion would suit those in Umno un­happy with Tan Sri Muhyid­din, with­out them hav­ing to back Mr An­war – a neme­sis for the past two decades – or co­op­er­ate with Mr An­war’s Chi­nese-dom­i­nated ally Demo­cratic Ac­tion Party, which they ac­cuse of try­ing to un­der­mine Malay-Mus­lim in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>Ber­satu of­fi­cials be­lieve their pres­i­dent – whose PN had a ra­zor-thin con­trol of Par­lia­ment with just 113 MPs be­fore this week’s drama – re­mains the front run­ner given the di­vi­sions among other pre­tenders.</p>
