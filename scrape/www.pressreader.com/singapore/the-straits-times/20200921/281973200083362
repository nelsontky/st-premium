    <p>Af­ter plan­ning their wed­ding for a year, Mr De­van Lak­shamanan, 34, and Ms Vanitha Jayaku­mar, 31, were in­formed at the last minute by the Registry of Mar­riages (ROM) that their solem­ni­sa­tion on April 10 had to be post­poned.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties had im­posed cir­cuit breaker mea­sures to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pan­demic and the cou­ple’s plans, like those of thou­sands of oth­ers in Sin­ga­pore, were dashed.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, who had been dat­ing for five years, can­celled the wed­ding din­ner on April 10 they had planned for 250 guests at the Civil Ser­vice Club.</p>
    <p>Mr Lak­shamanan, a busi­ness de­vel­op­ment ex­ec­u­tive, said: “We were dis­traught and lost as we had in­vested so much emo­tional en­ergy into it.”</p>
    <p>There was noth­ing to do but wait. In July, when the Gov­ern­ment an­nounced that from Aug 4, a wed­ding party can have up to 50 peo­ple, Mr Lak­shamanan and Ms Jayaku­mar jumped for joy and brought their wed­ding fin­ery out of stor­age.</p>
    <p>On Sept 6 – an aus­pi­cious date in the Hindu as­tro­log­i­cal cal­en­dar – the cou­ple solem­nised their union and per­formed Hindu prayers and wed­ding rit­u­als at Or­chid Coun­try Club. All in, there were 48 guests at the event.</p>
    <p>Ms Jayaku­mar, a se­nior l and­scape de­signer, said they were re­lieved to fi­nally be able to take their mar­riage vows.</p>
    <p>The happy oc­ca­sion, how­ever, was tinged with sad­ness – she was up­set that the cou­ple could not in­vite many mem­bers of their ex­tended fam­ily and close friends to share their joy.</p>
    <p>So, they are plan­ning to hold an­other wed­ding cer­e­mony in Jan­uary next year at a Hindu tem­ple and hope that, by then, they can in­vite more guests.</p>
    <p>Like the Lak­shamanans, thou­sands of cou­ples in Sin­ga­pore have had their wed­ding plans dis­rupted by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of cou­ples who solem­nised their mar­riages from Jan­uary to July last year was 13,626.</p>
    <p>That num­ber fell 23 per cent to 10,542 dur­ing the same pe­riod this year.</p>
    <p>An ROM spokesman, in re­sponse to queries from The Straits Times, said more cou­ples are ex­pected to wed in the last quar­ter of the year.</p>
    <p>On Sept 2 in Par­lia­ment, Min­is­ter of State for So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment and for Ed­u­ca­tion Sun Xuel­ing said there was a fall in the num­ber of nup­tials this year.</p>
    <p>“This will have a neg­a­tive im­pact on the num­ber of new­borns in Sin­ga­pore,” she said.</p>
    <p>So­ci­ol­o­gist Tan Ern Ser said Sin­ga­pore­ans gen­er­ally do not have chil­dren out of wed­lock.</p>
    <p>If there are fewer cou­ples get­ting mar­ried, it fol­lows that there are likely to be fewer ba­bies be­ing born.</p>
    <p>That is a wor­ry­ing de­vel­op­ment, given Sin­ga­pore’s baby drought and rapidly age­ing pop­u­la­tion, added Dr Tan.</p>
    <p>Wed­ding solem­nis­ers and plan­ners said many cou­ples have de­cided to post­pone their wed­dings due to the pan­demic, lead­ing to a sharp fall in solem­ni­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, most of the 2,723 solem­ni­sa­tions sched­uled dur­ing</p>
    <p>the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod last­ing from April 7 to June 1 had to be post­poned.</p>
    <p>The ROM spokesman said this was be­cause cou­ples were not al­lowed to solem­nise their mar­riages in per­son, ex­cept if they were suc­cess­ful on ap­peal.</p>
    <p>From May 20, solem­ni­sa­tions con­ducted by video link were al­lowed.</p>
    <p>From Aug 4, up to 50 peo­ple are al­lowed to at­tend wed­ding cer­e­monies, in­clud­ing the wed­ding cou­ple but ex­clud­ing the solem­niser and staff of the ven­dors in­volved in the event.</p>
    <p>This was up from a max­i­mum of 10 peo­ple dur­ing phase one of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing on June 2, and a cap of 20 peo­ple in phase two, which started on June 19.</p>
    <p>Solem­niser Joanna Por­tilla said some cou­ples opted to post­pone their wed­ding. With the 50-per­son cap in place now, she said: “They have planned for their ideal wed­ding and they are dis­ap­pointed as they can­not in­vite all the peo­ple they want.”</p>
    <p>Wed­ding plan­ner Her­lina Mak­mur from Chere Wed­dings and Events said some cou­ples have also post­poned their wed­dings be­cause the bor­ders of many coun­tries are closed and im­por­tant fam­ily mem­bers or friends are not able to travel to Sin­ga­pore to cel­e­brate their big day.</p>
    <p>While most cou­ples choose to solem­nise their mar­riages in per­son, 7 per cent of all solem­ni­sa­tions, or 405, have been con­ducted via video link since June 2, when cou­ples could solem­nise mar­riages in per­son again.</p>
    <p>The ROM spokesman said: “There is still de­mand for vide­olink solem­ni­sa­tions, mainly from</p>
    <p>cou­ples who wish to in­clude more fam­ily and friends, in­clud­ing those from over­seas, dur­ing the solem­ni­sa­tion. And they would like to en­sure safety by min­imis­ing phys­i­cal gath­er­ings.”</p>
    <p>Solem­niser Chia Swee Tin said the im­prov­ing Covid-19 sit­u­a­tion in</p>
    <p>Num­ber of mar­riage no­tices that had been filed for solem­ni­sa­tions on Oct 10, as at Sept 7. In com­par­i­son, there were 57 solem­ni­sa­tions on Oct 10 last year.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore could be a key rea­son for more cou­ples plan­ning to tie the knot in the last three months of the year.</p>
    <p>In par­tic­u­lar, Oct 10 is turn­ing out to be a very pop­u­lar date – 800 mar­riage no­tices had been filed for solem­ni­sa­tions for that day, as at Sept 7.</p>
    <p>In com­par­i­son, there were 57 solem­ni­sa­tions on Oct 10 last year.</p>
    <p>Ms Zhang Wenxin from the Wed­ding Stylist said Oct 10 sig­ni­fies per­fec­tion in Chi­nese, al­lud­ing to the Man­darin id­iom shi quan shi mei, or per­fect in ev­ery way.</p>
    <p>Be­sides, the date falls on a Satur­day this year, and cou­ples gen­er­ally like dou­ble num­bers – such as Aug 8 and Oct 10 – be­cause they are easy to re­mem­ber, among other rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Mr Josiah Koh, 27, and Ms Eve­lyn Fong, 25, tied the knot on Aug 22.</p>
    <p>The cou­ple, both oc­cu­pa­tional ther­a­pists, had booked their ban­quet for 250 guests at the Re­gent Ho­tel about a year be­fore the big day.</p>
    <p>Al­though the pan­demic dis­rupted their plans, they de­cided to go ahead with their solem­ni­sa­tion and ban­quet, and cel­e­brated the event with 48 of their fam­ily mem­bers and clos­est friends. They also live-streamed their solem­ni­sa­tion for guests who could not at­tend.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Fong: “This is my dream wed­ding – a smaller and less pompous event.”</p>
    <p>An added bonus, Mr Koh said, was that they saved be­tween $30,000 and $40,000 af­ter hav­ing to trim their guest list by 200.</p>
    <p>The money saved will go a long way to­wards help­ing to set up their new home, he added.</p>
