    <p>Sin­ga­pore wel­comed a wet and windy start to 2021, with mod­er­ate to heavy show­ers around the is­land through­out New Year’s Day.</p>
    <p>Tem­per­a­tures fell be­low 22 deg C in parts of Sin­ga­pore ow­ing to pro­longed rain that be­gan yes­ter­day morning.</p>
    <p>Cool weather was felt in sev­eral lo­ca­tions on the is­land, with tem­per­a­tures drop­ping to 21.2 deg C in Bukit Timah and New­ton, and 21.4 deg C in Ad­mi­ralty.</p>
    <p>Heavy rain over parts of the is­land also sparked warn­ings of po­ten­tial flash floods at five lo­ca­tions yes­ter­day af­ter­noon.</p>
    <p>Na­tional wa­ter agency PUB said in a Face­book post at around 12.55pm yes­ter­day that the public should avoid Jalan Seav­iew and Mount­bat­ten Road for the next hour as wa­ter lev­els in drains and canals in these ar­eas had reached 90 per cent.</p>
    <p>In an up­date, PUB added Siang Kuang Av­enue and Langsat Road / Lorong 105 Changi at around 1.40pm to the list, and West Coast Road at 1.58pm.</p>
    <p>The show­ers also led to sev­eral ve­hi­cles be­ing stranded in Pasir Ris Farmway. Videos cir­cu­lat­ing on so­cial me­dia yes­ter­day showed a Re­nault Me­gane stuck in an­kle­high wa­ter. Three Sin­ga­pore Civil De­fence Force (SCDF) of­fi­cers were seen push­ing the ve­hi­cle.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries from The</p>
    <p>Straits Times, SCDF said it re­ceived a call for as­sis­tance near the junc­tion of Pasir Ris Farmway 3 and Lorong Halus at about 2.30pm.</p>
    <p>Four ve­hi­cles were re­moved from the af­fected area by SCDF of­fi­cers. There were no re­ported in­juries, it added.</p>
    <p>The cool and windy con­di­tions are set to per­sist, ac­cord­ing to a weather ad­vi­sory by the Me­te­o­ro­log­i­cal Ser­vice Sin­ga­pore (MSS) on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>The first week of the year is fore­cast to be cool and windy, with pe­ri­ods of mod­er­ate to heavy show­ers over Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The wet weather is ex­pected with the strength­en­ing of a high-pres­sure sys­tem over north­ern Asia, which will bring about a surge of strong north-east­erly winds over the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Over­all, rain­fall for the first half of this month is fore­cast to be above av­er­age over most parts of the is­land, said the MSS.</p>
    <p>Mod­er­ate thun­dery show­ers can be ex­pected in the af­ter­noon on most days over the fort­night ow­ing to strong so­lar heat­ing of land ar­eas. These could ex­tend into the evening on a few days.</p>
    <p>Heavy and wide­spread thun­dery show­ers over the is­land will also occur on a cou­ple of days.</p>
    <p>Daily tem­per­a­tures are look­ing to be rel­a­tively low, with the MSS fore­cast­ing an av­er­age of 23 deg C to 33 deg C over the fort­night, dip­ping to about 22 deg C on some days.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the daily max­i­mum tem­per­a­ture may still hit as high as 34 deg C on one or two days.</p>
    <p>Last month saw sim­i­larly cool and rainy weather.</p>
    <p>Most parts of the is­land recorded near av­er­age rain­fall last month, ex­cept for a few parts of western Sin­ga­pore. The Choa Chu Kang area recorded rain­fall that was 39 per cent be­low av­er­age.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age daily tem­per­a­ture last month was be­tween 22.2 deg C and 35.1 deg C.</p>
    <p>The high­est recorded tem­per­a­ture in the month was 35.1 deg C on Christ­mas Day in Ad­mi­ralty, and the low­est was recorded three days later, at 22.2 deg C in Sem­bawang on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>While it rained over the is­land on most days of the month, the mean monthly tem­per­a­ture of 27.2 deg C for De­cem­ber at the Changi climate sta­tion was 0.8 deg C higher than the month’s long-term av­er­age, said the MSS.</p>
