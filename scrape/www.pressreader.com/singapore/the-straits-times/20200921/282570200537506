    <p>Tai­wanese tele­vi­sion host Jacky Wu hinted that Mr Player, the pop­u­lar out­door va­ri­ety pro­gramme he co-hosted with singer-host Alien Huang, may end af­ter Huang’s sud­den death last week.</p>
    <p>Wu was one of the more than 70 celebri­ties who at­tended Huang’s three-day wake last Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The 36-year-old singer, ac­tor and TV pre­sen­ter was found dead at home last Wed­nes­day. An au­topsy con­cluded that he died of an aor­tic dis­sec­tion, which had led to a block­age of his blood ves­sels.</p>
    <p>An aor­tic dis­sec­tion is a lifethreat­en­ing con­di­tion which oc­curs when the in­ner layer of the aorta – the large blood ves­sel branch­ing off the heart – tears.</p>
    <p>Wu, 62, was at the wake for about two hours with his daugh­ter, TV host Sandy Wu, and Kid Lin, the other Mr Player co-host yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Wu told Tai­wanese me­dia: “Kid and I are un­able to con­tinue record­ing the show. We will air the re­main­ing five episodes we have recorded be­fore dis­cussing the next step.”</p>
    <p>He said he and Lin have writ­ten a song ti­tled ? for Huang. They used the ques­tion mark to show they could not come to terms with their co-host’s death at such a young age.</p>
    <p>The lyrics in­clude: “How far is heaven? Did you bring enough lug­gage?”</p>
    <p>Other celebri­ties who at­tended the wake were Huang’s ex-girl­friend, singer Rainie Yang; TV host Sam Tseng as well as ac­tors Ann Hsu, James Wen and Sunny Wang.</p>
    <p>His cur­rent girl­friend is cheer­leader Wu Han-chun, whom he had been dat­ing in secret for the past 11/ years. 2</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese en­ter­tainer Show Lo, who co-hosted the long-run­ning va­ri­ety show 100% En­ter­tain­ment with Huang, was be­lieved to have gone to pay his re­spects at around mid­night yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He posted on In­sta­gram a photo of him­self out­side the wake venue and wrote: “I have come to see you. I hope you can hear me as I have many things to say to you. RIP.”</p>
    <p>Huang and Lo used to be good friends while host­ing 100% En­ter­tain­ment, but did not keep in touch when the for­mer left the show af­ter a mis­un­der­stand­ing.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Huang’s younger sis­ter Huang Ting-ting lamented on so­cial me­dia how much she missed him and said she re­gret­ted not tak­ing more photos with him.</p>
    <p>She also posted a fam­ily photo taken be­fore her brother’s death.</p>
