    <p>Ital­ian lux­ury brand Bul­gari is the lat­est en­tity to re­fute claims that it has any con­nec­tion to the Bel­la­graph Nova (BN) Group, the Sin­ga­pore-based com­pany be­hind a bid for English Premier League club New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>The brand’s Bul­gari Ho­tel Shang­hai had been men­tioned in mar­ket­ing ma­te­ri­als and in­ter­views as the lo­ca­tion of a “lux­u­ri­ous anti-age­ing” clinic that is be­ing set up by the group.</p>
    <p>But Ms Jenny Cheah, the re­gional man­ag­ing direc­tor of Bul­gari South Asia Op­er­a­tions, told The Straits Times yes­ter­day: “With ref­er­ence to the claimed ‘clinic’ at Bul­gari Ho­tel Shang­hai, there is no such fa­cil­ity planned.”</p>
    <p>She added: “We have no con­tact or as­so­ci­a­tion with the Bel­la­graph Nova Group and any of their re­lated group of com­pa­nies.”</p>
    <p>The BN Group was co-founded by Sin­ga­porean cousins Ter­ence Loh and Nel­son Loh and Chi­nese jew­ellery mer­chant Evan­ge­line Shen, also known as Shen Che.</p>
    <p>Its pub­lic­ity ma­te­rial has been un­der scru­tiny af­ter it emerged that it had doc­tored images fea­tur­ing its own­ers and for­mer US pres­i­dent</p>
    <p>Barack Obama. Other state­ments have also been dis­puted.</p>
    <p>A com­pany linked to one of the Loh cousins be­hind the group is called Novena Bul­gari Aes­thet­ics, with its reg­is­tered of­fice at the Novena Gar­dens build­ing in Thom­son Road.</p>
    <p>Re­spond­ing to queries by The Straits Times on whether Bul­gari is linked to this, Ms Cheah said: “The Bul­gari group is the ex­clu­sive owner of the Bul­gari/Bvl­gari trade­marks and will force­fully de­fend its rights in the ap­pro­pri­ate way.”</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with The Busi­ness Times in June, Mr Ter­ence Loh said the group ex­pects to open its US$40 mil­lion (S$54.5 mil­lion) “first uber lux­ury anti-age­ing med­i­cal well­ness fa­cil­ity” within the Bul­gari Ho­tel Shang­hai, and that this is a tie-up with Switzer­land’s Clin­ique La Prairie.</p>
    <p>This fa­cil­ity was an­nounced un­der Novena Bel­la­graph Aes­thet­ics and was set to be launched at the end of this year.</p>
    <p>A press state­ment said Ms Shen was “launch­ing Asia’s largest and most lux­u­ri­ous anti-age­ing hospi­tal clinic at the lux­u­ri­ous Bvl­gari Ho­tel in Shang­hai”.</p>
    <p>It was said in an­other state­ment that the fa­cil­ity was 8,000 sq m in size and that it would pro­vide “ex­clu­sive un­par­al­leled at­ten­tion and ser­vice, fea­tur­ing the lat­est sta­teof-the-art med­i­cal and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tech­nol­ogy that ex­ists, to its ex­clu­sive group of clients”.</p>
    <p>Bul­gari’s state­ment comes af­ter other or­gan­i­sa­tions and in­di­vid­u­als have dis­tanced them­selves from the group and its af­fil­i­ates.</p>
    <p>Among them is for­mer United States am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Kirk Wa­gar, who re­signed from his in­de­pen­dent direc­tor po­si­tion in Catal­ist-listed Ax­ing­ton, where the Lohs are con­trol­ling share­hold­ers and Ms Shen is its non-in­de­pen­dent non-ex­ec­u­tive chair­man.</p>
    <p>The bad pub­lic­ity has also led some anx­ious lo­cal and re­gional in­vestors to step up ef­forts to pull out mil­lions of dol­lars in­vested in en­ti­ties un­der the Novena Global Health­care Group founded by the cousins, The Busi­ness Times re­ported.</p>
    <p>NO FA­CIL­ITY PLANNED</p>
    <p>With ref­er­ence to the claimed ‘clinic’ at Bul­gari Ho­tel Shang­hai, there is no such fa­cil­ity planned. We have no con­tact or as­so­ci­a­tion with the Bel­la­graph Nova Group and any of their re­lated ’’ group of com­pa­nies.</p>
