    <p>I of­ten hear peo­ple prais­ing hawker food, say­ing it tastes nicer and is cheaper com­pared with food sold at food­courts and cof­fee shops (Build hawker cen­tre in Bukit Ba­tok town, Dec 25).</p>
    <p>This is not nec­es­sar­ily true. Gone are the days when hawker food was cheap, and stall­hold­ers did every­thing them­selves with no added cost from the en­gage­ment of clean­ers and dish­wash­ers, thereby sav­ing op­er­a­tional costs.</p>
    <p>I find that apart from food sold at air-con­di­tioned food­courts in shopping malls that may be a lit­tle pricier, most food sold at non-air-con­di­tioned food­courts and cof­fee shops in the heart­land is cheaper than the food sold at hawker cen­tres, or com­pa­ra­ble in price.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, it tastes just as good, and there is no lack of va­ri­ety.</p>
    <p>The stall­hold­ers also seem to take fewer days off and work long hours, which al­lows din­ers to have their meals even late at night.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, at hawker cen­tres, stall­hold­ers tend to sell sim­i­lar or re­peated dishes. For ex­am­ple, at Maxwell Food Cen­tre, which is fa­mous for chicken rice, I found no fewer than six chicken rice stalls. At Hong Lim Food Cen­tre, there are at least three stalls sell­ing chicken curry noo­dles.</p>
    <p>With more com­pe­ti­tion among hawk­ers sell­ing the same food items, each stall owner’s share of tak­ings would be re­duced.</p>
    <p>Such a sit­u­a­tion may not al­low these hawk­ers to earn enough to cover their op­er­at­ing costs and ren­tal, in spite of the hard work and long hours they put in.</p>
    <p>Thus, it may not be the case that op­er­at­ing a stall at a hawker cen­tre in the heart­land would pro­vide a steady source of in­come.</p>
    <p>The hawker trade does not seem to be like it was in the past.</p>
