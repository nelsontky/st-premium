    <p>HONG KONG China’s Ping An In­sur­ance Group raised its stake in HSBC Hold­ings af­ter HSBC shares slumped to their low­est in a quar­ter of a cen­tury, giv­ing sup­port to the lender that is fac­ing mount­ing dif­fi­cul­ties on sev­eral fronts.</p>
    <p>Ping An As­set Man­age­ment, a unit of the in­surer, re­vealed in an ex­change fil­ing that last week, it bought 10.8 mil­lion shares of HSBC, bring­ing its stake to 8 per cent and ce­ment­ing its place as the largest share­holder.</p>
    <p>Ping An pur­chased the shares at an av­er­age of HK$28.2859 apiece. HSBC ended last Fri­day at</p>
    <p>HK$28.20. Last week, HSBC’s shares plunged to a 25-year low, in part on spec­u­la­tion that its push into China could be thwarted.</p>
    <p>The rul­ing Com­mu­nist Party’s Global Times news­pa­per re­ported that the bank could be put on an “un­re­li­able en­tity” list that aims to pun­ish firms, or­gan­i­sa­tions or in­di­vid­u­als that dam­age na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>Ping An said last week that its hold­ing is a “long-term fi­nan­cial in­vest­ment”. The Shen­zhen-based com­pany, which has owned a ma­jor stake in HSBC since late 2017, has seen the value of those shares tum­ble by at least US$8.6 bil­lion (S$11.8 bil­lion) over the past three years, ac­cord­ing to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong-based in­sur­ance an­a­lyst Steven Lam from Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence said: “Ping An is a long-term in­vestor, so the crit­i­cal point is whether there are struc­tural is­sues at the bank that go against the in­surer’s in­vest­ment phi­los­o­phy.”</p>
    <p>HSBC was also among the global banks named in a re­port by the In­ter­na­tional Con­sor­tium of In­ves­tiga­tive Jour­nal­ists on lenders that “kept prof­it­ing from pow­er­ful and dan­ger­ous play­ers” in the past two decades, even af­ter the United States im­posed penal­ties on the in­sti­tu­tions.</p>
    <p>Fac­ing dif­fi­cul­ties in nav­i­gat­ing low in­ter­est rates and surg­ing loan losses sparked by the global pan­demic, the bank’s profit halved in the first half of this year.</p>
