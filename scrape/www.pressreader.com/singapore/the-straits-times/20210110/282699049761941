    <p>In its bid to kick-start a new era of wa­ter polo supremacy in the re­gion and make the Asian Games podium by 2030, the Singapore Swim­ming As­so­ci­a­tion (SSA) an­nounced yes­ter­day the ap­point­ment of for­mer Aus­tralia as­sis­tant coach Paul Oberman as its wa­ter polo tech­ni­cal direc­tor.</p>
    <p>The 52-year-old, who is on a two-year con­tract, is a fa­mil­iar face in the lo­cal fra­ter­nity, hav­ing been SSA’s wa­ter polo coach­ing direc­tor from 2007 to 2008. The for­mer player had com­peted at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, where Aus­tralia fin­ished fifth.</p>
    <p>He said: “Singapore wa­ter polo has a stel­lar track record at Asean level but has the po­ten­tial to go so much fur­ther.</p>
    <p>“The SSA has rightly iden­ti­fied long-term sus­tain­abil­ity in pipe­line and tech­ni­cal ca­pa­bil­ity de­vel­op­ment as the strat­egy that will en­able Singapore to re­alise its full po­ten­tial. I look for­ward to be­ing part of the team in im­ple­ment­ing this cru­cial piece of the strat­egy and work­ing with the head coach and ath­letes.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter win­ning 27 straight gold medals at the SEA Games since 1965, Singapore’s men’s wa­ter polo team re­turned from the Philip­pines with a bronze in 2019, while the women’s team were sil­ver medal­lists from 2015 to 2019.</p>
    <p>The SSA sub­se­quently con­ducted a re­view of its wa­ter polo strat­egy and iden­ti­fied key ar­eas in which the team could im­prove, in­clud­ing the limited pool of play­ers for the na­tional squad, men­tal re­silience in com­pe­ti­tion, and lead­er­ship.</p>
    <p>While Oberman, a for­mer Western Aus­tralian In­sti­tute of Sport (WAIS) coach, told The Sun­day Times he will be meet­ing the SSA ex­ec­u­tive com­mit­tee to align their vi­sion and goals, he noted the im­por­tance of build­ing a crit­i­cal mass of play­ers and in­creas­ing their in­ter­na­tional ex­po­sure, and com­mu­ni­cat­ing with ath­letes and rel­e­vant stake­hold­ers such as par­ents and schools.</p>
    <p>He said: “We need to go to the grass­roots and schools to cre­ate a re­ally strong path­way and pipe­line. And it’s not just the ath­letes, it’s also coach ed­u­ca­tion, ref­eree de­vel­op­ment and en­abling vol­un­teers to be­come tech­ni­cal of­fi­cials to move for­ward as a whole.”</p>
    <p>Not­ing the pres­sure ath­letes face to bal­ance stud­ies and sports, he added: “It is all about putting to­gether a plan for the ath­lete, and think­ing about the qual­ity more than the quan­tity of train­ing. There needs to be a bit of com­pro­mise be­tween the com­pet­ing en­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>“When I was at WAIS, the pro­grammes were based on an ath­lete-cen­tred, coach-led, multi-dis­ci­plinary ap­proach. This takes into con­sid­er­a­tion all the com­pet­ing el­e­ments for the ath­lete’s time and en­ergy to help them get bet­ter in ev­ery area.”</p>
    <p>The na­tional youth teams can also broaden their hori­zons by aim­ing to com­pete at the world ju­nior cham­pi­onships, said Oberman.</p>
    <p>On the SSA’s new role, Do­minic Soh, its vice-pres­i­dent for wa­ter polo, said that Oberman will com­ple­ment the role of its head coach by fo­cus­ing on re­view­ing and im­prov­ing l ong-term ath­lete and coach de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes at club and school lev­els, while the lat­ter fo­cuses on the tac­ti­cal im­prove­ment of the na­tional teams.</p>
    <p>While wa­ter polo has been omit­ted from the 2021 SEA Games in Vietnam – it was among more than 15 sports and events dropped by the hosts – the sport is still hold­ing out hope for in­clu­sion via an ap­peal through the Singapore Na­tional Olympic Coun­cil.</p>
    <p>If that hap­pens, Soh be­lieves that the team are in good hands as they re­build for their gold-medal chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>He said: “While we have had good coaches in the past who were able to steer the men’s teams to glory at each SEA Games, longterm sus­tain­abil­ity was an is­sue as we had gaps in pipe­line and tech­ni­cal de­vel­op­ment ca­pa­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“This meant that our progress would even­tu­ally stag­nate and oth­ers would catch up and they did.</p>
    <p>“The tech­ni­cal direc­tor role is a cru­cial piece in our strat­egy that will not only help us re­gain our SEA Games gold medal but en­able us to up our game at the Asian Games level.”</p>
    <p>QUAL­ITY OVER QUAN­TITY</p>
    <p>It is all about putting to­gether a plan for the ath­lete, and think­ing about the qual­ity more than the quan­tity of train­ing. There needs to be a bit of com­pro­mise be­tween the com­pet­ing en­ti­ties.</p>
