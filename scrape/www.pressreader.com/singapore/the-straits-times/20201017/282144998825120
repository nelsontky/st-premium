    <p>The Build­ing Con­struc­tion and Tim­ber In­dus­tries Em­ploy­ees’ Union (Batu) has al­ways fought for the rights of our es­sen­tial ser­vices work­ers in the en­vi­ron­men­tal ser­vices in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>In my for­mer roles with it, I rep­re­sented the union in the tri­par­tite clus­ter for clean­ers and also the tri­par­tite clus­ter for land­scape which made the rec­om­men­da­tions for the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model (PWM) in the two in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>It is re­gret­ful that the Work­ers’ Party’s Ja­mus Lim made comments in Par­lia­ment on Thurs­day not just be­lit­tling our hard work all th­ese years, but also seem­ingly putting down the in­tri­cate is­sues in­volved in out­sourced in­dus­tries such as clean­ing, land­scape and lift main­te­nance.</p>
    <p>Folksy, as we un­der­stand the term, refers to a sim­ple man­ner of one be­ing friendly and, per­haps, in­for­mal in be­hav­iour. In other cir­cum­stances, union­ists like us may not take of­fence at the term.</p>
    <p>How­ever, in the con­text of the par­lia­men­tary de­bate, when As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Lim al­luded to “folksy” union lead­ers who think that the Sun re­volves around the</p>
    <p>Earth, it be­lit­tles the years of hard work put in by union­ists.</p>
    <p>When work­ing at the PWM for the clean­ing and land­scape in­dus­tries, Batu en­gaged many work­ers to get feed­back, and went be­yond just facts and fig­ures from the stake­hold­ers in the tri­par­tite com­mit­tees.</p>
    <p>Between 2013 and 2018, real me­dian monthly gross wages of full-time clean­ers and land­scape work­ers grew cu­mu­la­tively by around 30 per cent and 32 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Batu con­tin­ued to lobby for im­prove­ments to the ex­ist­ing manda­tory PWM sec­tors and, at the same time, pushed for ex­pan­sion to other sec­tors as well.</p>
    <p>There is no doubt all union­ists care deeply for our work­ers. We wish for them to achieve more in their jobs, giv­ing them the dig­nity of earn­ing a de­cent liv­ing and the pride of ca­reer pro­gres­sion.</p>
    <p>The PWM al­lows for that. Since the PWM was im­ple­mented, it has been eas­ier to en­cour­age work­ers to up­skill them­selves. We are con­fi­dent this will bode well for them in the near fu­ture, even as the econ­omy re­shapes dur­ing this cri­sis. Na­sor­din B. Mohd Hashim</p>
