    <p>From next month, em­ploy­ers must pay a one-time place­ment fee that used to be borne by in­com­ing maids from In­done­sia. A new rul­ing by the In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties will add an ex­tra cost of up to $3,000. The fee is meant to cover ex­penses in­curred by new maids com­ing to Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>From next month, em­ploy­ers must pay a one-time place­ment fee that used to be borne by in­com­ing for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers (FDWs) from In­done­sia.</p>
    <p>Sin­gle mother Lynda Lee, who has re­lied on FDWs from In­done­sia for the last 10 years, is re­signed to look­ing else­where to re­place her for­mer helper.</p>
    <p>This is be­cause a new rul­ing by the In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties – to pass the cost of an FDW’s place­ment fee to the em­ployer from next month – will add an ex­tra cost of up to $3,000.</p>
    <p>The one-time fee – to cover ex­penses such as trans­porta­tion, ac­com­mo­da­tion and med­i­cal ex­am­i­na­tions in­curred by new FDWs com­ing to Sin­ga­pore – used to be clawed back from the maid by de­duct­ing her salary for months.</p>
    <p>A Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) spokesman told The New Pa­per it has re­ceived feed­back from em­ploy­ment agen­cies here that the In­done­sian au­thor­i­ties are en­forc­ing a “zero place­ment fee pol­icy” from Jan 1 next year. The rul­ing means em­ploy­ers must now pay this fee to en­able new In­done­sian FDWs to come to Sin­ga­pore debt-free.</p>
    <p>Like many em­ploy­ers, Ms Lee, who lives with her two young chil­dren and 84-year-old par­ents, is baulk­ing at the ex­tra ex­pense.</p>
    <p>The sales man­ager, 52, said she will con­sider other na­tion­al­i­ties to re­place the helper who had just left her em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>She told TNP: “It al­ready costs so much to hire a new maid. I have no choice but to look else­where.”</p>
    <p>In­done­sian maid Rini Supriy­ati said that $340 was de­ducted from her salary for nine months to set­tle her debt when she be­gan work­ing here 11 years ago.</p>
    <p>The 35-year-old said: “It was dif­fi­cult as I had to sup­port my hus­band and three-year-old son. This new rule will help new maids.”</p>
    <p>But in­dus­try play­ers TNP spoke to feel the rule may end up dis­ad­van­tag­ing both em­ploy­ers and FDWs.</p>
    <p>Ms K. Jayaprema, pres­i­dent of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Em­ploy­ment Agen­cies, said em­ploy­ers may look for lower-cost maids from other coun­tries such as Myan­mar.</p>
    <p>She said the place­ment fee is $2,000 on av­er­age but can rise to $3,000, and takes about six months for an FDW to pay off.</p>
    <p>Of the 252,000 FDWs in Sin­ga­pore as at June, 127,000 are In­done­sian. The min­i­mum wage of an In­done­sian FDW is $550 a month, and $570 and $450 for Filipino and Myan­mar FDWs re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Ms Jayaprema said: “What hap­pens if the FDW de­cides to leave a month or two af­ter the em­ployer pays the fee? There is cur­rently no re­course for this.”</p>
    <p>FI­NAN­CIAL BUR­DEN</p>
    <p>Mr Brian Tan, di­rec­tor of maid agency Na­tion Hu­man Re­sources, said the Covid-19 pan­demic has al­ready been a fi­nan­cial bur­den on em­ploy­ers who must pay up to $1,700 for an in­com­ing FDW’s swab tests and quar­an­tine at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>He added: “We hope that MOM can con­sider speak­ing to the In­done­sian gov­ern­ment to help al­le­vi­ate some of the bur­den on Sin­ga­pore em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>The MOM spokesman said: “Em­ploy­ment agen­cies are in dis­cus­sion with their In­done­sian re­cruiters on how they can meet the re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>“Em­ploy­ers who have ur­gent needs and are fac­ing de­lays in bring­ing in FDWs from In­done­sia can dis­cuss their op­tions with the em­ploy­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>“MOM has, in the last few weeks, been ap­prov­ing a larger num­ber of FDWs from var­i­ous coun­tries to en­ter Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>In a ra­dio in­ter­view, Cen­tre for Do­mes­tic Em­ploy­ees chair­man Yeo Guat Kwang ex­pressed his con­cern about the un­in­tended con­se­quences this pol­icy may have on em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>“If an em­ployer is pay­ing a high price to hire an In­done­sian FDW, there could be a per­cep­tion among em­ploy­ers that the higher costs of hir­ing equate to a more qual­i­fied FDW. We are con­cerned that if the FDW fails to meet the ex­pec­ta­tions of the em­ployer... due to cul­tural mis­match, per­ceived lack of rel­e­vant skills or com­mu­ni­ca­tion is­sues, then it will lead to a break­down in the em­ploy­ment re­la­tion­ship,” he said.</p>
    <p>“The FDW may end up be­ing sent back to the agent or, worse, repa­tri­ated in the early stages of em­ploy­ment.”</p>
