    <p>He may be 67 years old, but Mr Francis Chew had no qualms about go­ing back to school to pick up a new skill.</p>
    <p>After four decades in the food and bev­er­age (F&B) sec­tor, he left his job this year as a se­nior man­ager with a com­pany that runs restau­rants, to start a year-long SGUnited Skills maritime busi­ness man­age­ment pro­gramme at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>He be­gan the course after se­cur­ing one of the 1,000 train­ing and at­tach­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties in the maritime in­dus­try for re­cent grad­u­ates and mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als un­der the var­i­ous SGUnited Skills pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>The Govern­ment had an­nounced 200 open­ings in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and For­eign Af­fairs Chee Hong Tat said an additional 800 open­ings in the maritime in­dus­try are now avail­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew had worked for var­i­ous F&B es­tab­lish­ments, in­clud­ing McDon­ald’s, over 40 years.</p>
    <p>In 2017, he was en­trusted by a com­pany he worked for to fly to Aus­tralia to set up an eatery.</p>
    <p>But when the Covid-19 pan­demic hit the in­dus­try hard, Mr Chew sensed a lack of prospects and de­cided to part with the com­pany, leav­ing on good terms.</p>
    <p>In­stead of re­tir­ing, he chose to ex­plore a new in­dus­try. At a ca­reer fair, he learnt about the course at Sin­ga­pore Polytech­nic.</p>
    <p>The part-time diploma course al­lows Mr Chew, who has an A-level cer­tifi­cate, to pick up new do­main knowl­edge while re­ceiv­ing a monthly al­lowance of $1,200.</p>
    <p>After sub­si­dies, he paid $1,000 to at­tend the course. Of that sum, $500 came from his Skill­sFu­ture Credit.</p>
    <p>Those in the pro­gramme learn skills in ship­ping op­er­a­tions and lo­gis­tics, and off­shore man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew said his in­ter­est in the maritime in­dus­try was piqued dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker that be­gan in April. He also learnt that it is a growth area.</p>
    <p>“I need to keep on learn­ing to main­tain my men­tal and phys­i­cal health, and my ac­tive life­style. At 67, I’m still ac­tive, I can still run and swim. I want to live hap­pily and healthily,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Chew lives with his wife in a Hous­ing Board flat in Wood­lands.</p>
    <p>He started the course on Oct 5, but has al­ready looked for jobs. “The maritime in­dus­try is very wide, and I want to at least know what roles I can take on in the fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>Like Mr Chew, Mr Luq­manul Yu­sof is new to the maritime in­dus­try. He has taken up a nine-month trainee­ship position as a tech­ni­cal as­sis­tant at Bern­hard Schulte Ship­man­age­ment, where he sup­ports the pro­cure­ment and cer­ti­fi­ca­tion of ves­sels.</p>
    <p>The 23-year-old started in July, after grad­u­at­ing from Bri­tain’s Univer­sity of Ply­mouth with a maritime busi­ness and lo­gis­tics de­gree.</p>
    <p>His in­ter­est in the maritime sec­tor was aroused in sec­ondary school by friends and fam­ily mem­bers who worked on ves­sels in var­i­ous roles, in­clud­ing engi­neer­ing ones.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that in­ter­est in the maritime in­dus­try is slowly gain­ing ex­po­sure among young peo­ple,” he said.</p>
