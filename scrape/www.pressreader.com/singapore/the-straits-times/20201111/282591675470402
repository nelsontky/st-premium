    <p>A seden­tary of­fice job with long hours, cou­pled with work stress, can take a toll on your health. Here are some tips to stay healthy at work.</p>
    <p>HAVE LIGHT MEALS</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery­one has the lux­ury of hav­ing break­fast at home. But don’t set­tle for a packet of oily econ­omy bee hoon that you can con­ve­niently buy on the way to work. Have a bowl of oat­meal in­stead. It’s high in fi­bre and pro­tein, and helps to reg­u­late blood sugar and choles­terol lev­els.</p>
    <p>At lunchtime, skip greasy hawker fare such as chicken rice and char kway teow in favour of health­ier dishes such as fish soup and yong tau foo. Apart from be­ing de­li­cious, they help pre­vent a food coma at your desk later.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tively, pack a sand­wich or salad from home. You get to con­trol the in­gre­di­ents and the amount of oil, sodium and fat. Sim­ply put in some prep work the night be­fore and grab your food as you head out the door in the morn­ing.</p>
    <p>SNACK WISELY</p>
    <p>It might be tempt­ing to reach for a bag of po­tato chips or cook­ies when the mid-af­ter­noon crav­ings hit.</p>
    <p>Re­sist these high-fat snacks and choose fruits, nuts or yo­gurt in­stead. Ba­nanas and al­monds will sa­ti­ate your hunger while pro­vid­ing an en­ergy boost. Opt for low-fat plain yo­gurt and add muesli, blue­ber­ries or honey for a yummy and sat­is­fy­ing snack.</p>
    <p>If you must have some­thing sweet, go for dark choco­late that is rich in an­tiox­i­dants that may help to lower the risk of heart dis­ease.</p>
    <p>TAKE A BREAK FROM YOUR SCREEN</p>
    <p>Break the monotony of star­ing at your com­puter screen and look away ev­ery 20 min­utes for 20 sec­onds, fo­cus­ing on a dis­tance of 20 feet. Known as the 20-20-20 rule, this prac­tice min­imises one’s ex­po­sure to harm­ful blue light, which can cause eye strain, blurred vi­sion and sleep dis­or­ders.</p>
    <p>GET MOV­ING</p>
    <p>Sit­ting down all day isn’t good for you, so get up and stretch those legs ev­ery hour. Make a trip to the pantry to get wa­ter or take a longer route to the printer. If you have more time, step out to walk around your build­ing or climb a few flights of stairs. Even a five-minute walk can do won­ders by ex­er­cis­ing your mus­cles and get­ting your blood flow­ing — you'll re­turn to your desk more en­er­gised and re­freshed.</p>
