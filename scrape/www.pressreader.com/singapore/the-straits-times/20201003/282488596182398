    <p>LONDON Leeds United man­ager Marcelo Bielsa said on Thurs­day that Manch­ester City play a unique style of foot­ball un­der boss Pep Guardi­ola and praised the Spa­niard for his “imag­i­na­tive” ap­proach.</p>
    <p>Bielsa, who led Leeds to pro­mo­tion last sea­son from the Cham­pi­onship to the Premier League af­ter a 16-year ab­sence, was hailed by Guardi­ola as one of the im­por­tant in­flu­ences on the 49-year-old’s tro­phy-laden man­age­rial ca­reer.</p>
    <p>Bielsa, how­ever, said that he does not re­gard him­self as a master to Guardi­ola, who has made an im­pact at City by guid­ing them to two league ti­tles with his trade­mark pass­ing style.</p>
    <p>“I don’t feel like a men­tor to Guardi­ola, there is ev­i­dence that it is not the case,” Bielsa said ahead of to­day’s Premier League clash with City at El­land Road. “If there is a man­ager who is in­de­pen­dent in his ideas, it is Guardi­ola.</p>
    <p>“It’s not just be­cause I say it, it’s be­cause his teams play like no other teams. He’s imag­i­na­tive. He is able to in­stantly cre­ate so­lu­tions to prob­lems he comes across and he is able to im­ple­ment the things he pro­poses.</p>
    <p>“We see foot­ball in an imag­i­na­tive way and Guardi­ola imag­ines foot­ball in terms of free­dom in how they pro­pose so­lu­tions in the game and how they don’t need a lot of time to in­cor­po­rate that.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know many other coaches who would be de­serv­ing of this type of praise.”</p>
    <p>City bounced back from last week’s 5-2 home thrash­ing by</p>
    <p>Le­ices­ter City with a com­fort­able 3-0 win at Burn­ley in Wed­nes­day’s last-16 League Cup tie and Bielsa ex­pects a tricky test this week­end.</p>
    <p>“It’s one of the big­gest games in the Premier League,” the Ar­gen­tinian said. “We will try to play the way we al­ways do.”</p>
    <p>At his pre-match press con­fer­ence yes­ter­day, Guardi­ola re­it­er­ated that Bielsa “is the per­son in world foot­ball I ad­mire the most”.</p>
    <p>He added: “My the­ory is the man­ager is not about the ti­tles be­cause I feel far away from his knowl­edge.</p>
    <p>“My teams won more ti­tles than his, but in terms of knowl­edge of the game, I am away from him. It is a good present, a good gift to have him in the Premier League.</p>
    <p>“Leeds do ex­actly what they have to do. They are a team, fight for each other, de­fend a lot around the box.</p>
    <p>“They have good build-up. At the right moment, they ar­rive with a lot of play­ers.”</p>
    <p>The City boss did not give a de­fin­i­tive an­swer as to whether cen­tre­back Ruben Dias, the club’s lat­est sign­ing, will start to­day.</p>
    <p>“He will get it and we are de­lighted to have him here. He trained two ses­sions. Set­tles good and is part of the team. We will see,” Guardi­ola said.</p>
    <p>City, who are in 13th place af­ter one win and one loss, have sev­eral play­ers on the in­jury list.</p>
    <p>John Stones re­mains doubt­ful while Olek­sandr Zinchenko has suf­fered a fresh in­jury, just when he was on the cusp of re­turn­ing.</p>
    <p>Guardi­ola is also with­out a recog­nised se­nior striker, with Gabriel Je­sus and Ser­gio Aguero on the side­lines. Ra­heem Ster­ling could play as a false nine again af­ter scor­ing twice in the win over Burn­ley.</p>
    <p>Ilkay Gun­do­gan has com­pleted his 10-day iso­la­tion pe­riod fol­low­ing a pos­i­tive coro­n­avirus test but he is un­likely to fea­ture, while Joao Cancelo is also ab­sent.</p>
    <p>Leeds will be with­out loa­nee Jack Har­ri­son, who is in­el­i­gi­ble to face his par­ent club, while Pablo Her­nan­dez, Adam For­shaw and Kiko Casilla are still in­jured.</p>
