    <p>The ath­letic dis­ci­pline of javelin is in the spot­light – some­thing it rarely gets – af­ter good re­cent dis­plays: Justyn Phoa broke the 32-year-old men’s na­tional record, and Roy Ng set two age-group – Un­der-20 and U-18 – records.</p>
    <p>But while the show­ings are en­cour­ag­ing, they are still some way short of the SEA Games qual­i­fy­ing stan­dard.</p>
    <p>For years, javelin in Sin­ga­pore has been over­shad­owed by the goldmedal feats of ath­letes from other throw­ing events such as dis­cus and shot put.</p>
    <p>Dis­cus had James Wong, who won seven con­sec­u­tive SEA Games golds from 1993 to 2005 and nine over­all, be­sides one in ham­mer throw (1997).</p>
    <p>Shot put had six-time SEA Games cham­pion Zhang Guirong. Not only did she es­tab­lish her­self as South-east Asia’s best for over a decade, the two-time Olympian was also sec­ond at the 2005 Asian cham­pi­onships and Asian In­door Games.</p>
    <p>Yet the last time Sin­ga­pore won a men’s javelin medal, a bronze, in the re­gional Games was in 1973, when the bi­en­nial event was known as the South-east Asian Penin­su­lar Games. No one has reached the podium in the women’s event since Zhang’s bronze medal at the 2005 Games.</p>
    <p>But in the past few weeks, the na­tion’s javelin throwers have made their mark, with Justyn Phoa break­ing the 32-year-old men’s na­tional record and Roy Ng set­ting two na­tional age group – Un­der-20 and U-18 – marks.</p>
    <p>At the Sin­ga­pore Ath­let­ics (SA) Per­for­mance Trial 1 on Nov 29, Phoa rewrote Ng Bock Huat’s na­tional record of 59.22m with his 61.07m ef­fort.</p>
    <p>In the same meet, Roy, 17, set the U-20 mark of 57.19m and se­cured the U-18 record on Sun­day at the SA Per­for­mance Trial 2 af­ter a 61.79m ef­fort.</p>
    <p>Na­tional throws coach Akid Chong at­trib­uted the re­cent per­for­mances in part to tal­ent, de­scrib­ing this batch of ath­letes as the most tal­ented in over 30 years.</p>
    <p>Apart from the duo, he also iden­ti­fied Wang Tingjia, who pre­vi­ously held the U-20 and U-18 records that Roy broke, as an­other promis­ing prospect. Two of Wang’s at­tempts at the Home of Ath­let­ics in Kal­lang last Sun­day ex­ceeded 60m, with the 20-year-old record­ing throws of 60.28m and 60.56m.</p>
    <p>At the 2017 SEA Games, Koh Thong En had come close to the pre­vi­ous na­tional mark of 59.22m when he achieved 59.05m at the Bukit Jalil Na­tional Sta­dium in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
    <p>Chong, a throws coach since 2010, said: “The ath­letes them­selves are very tal­ented, they are the ma­jor fac­tor why we have 60m throws nowa­days.”</p>
    <p>Roy’s coach Chen Jin­long agreed, adding that the records are a re­sult of them be­ing mo­ti­vated and dis­ci­plined. De­spite the long lay­off from com­pe­ti­tion ow­ing to the coron­avirus pan­demic, the throwers still found ways to main­tain their form even when they were re­stricted to train­ing at home.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, Roy was do­ing weights and car­dio ex­er­cises to keep fit.</p>
    <p>Chen said: “They take the time to train on their own out­side of nor­mal train­ing hours. It’s all be­cause of their per­sis­tence, train­ing and pas­sion.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing coaches who can prop­erly guide them has been benefi</p>
    <p>cial for their de­vel­op­ment too.</p>
    <p>Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity stu­dent Phoa, 21, be­lieves that train­ing un­der Chong since the start of the year has been cru­cial be­cause he has a struc­tured train­ing pro­gramme to fol­low, un­like in 2018 when he was train­ing by him­self af­ter en­list­ing for na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>CON­DUCIVE EN­VI­RON­MENT</p>
    <p>Be­ing able to train in a ded­i­cated fa­cil­ity with­out dis­rup­tions has also helped.</p>
    <p>Since the start of the year, the na­tional ath­letes have had des­ig­nated time slots to train at the Home of Ath­let­ics.</p>
    <p>Chong, 30, said: “When you have a gym, run­ning track and throw­ing run­way that you can use with­out the pub­lic in­ter­fer­ing, you have peace of mind to train. You don’t have to worry about hit­ting an­other per­son at the other end, so psy­cho­log­i­cally they feel safe.”</p>
    <p>With many schools switch­ing to an ar­ti­fi­cial turf, Chen feels that train­ing at the Home of Ath­let­ics is good for ses­sions that re­quire the javelin. How­ever, the chances to use the field are also lim­ited as it is shared with other sports and pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>GET­TING TO SEA GAMES</p>
    <p>While the records are en­cour­ag­ing, those in the fra­ter­nity ac­knowl­edged that there is still some way to go be­fore the javelin throwers catch up with those in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>The qual­i­fy­ing mark for the SEA Games next year is 70.88m, the bronze medal dis­tance at last year’s Games, won by Melvin Calano of the Philip­pines with an ef­fort of 72.86m. The Games record is 76.30m.</p>
    <p>Gary Yeo, SA’s vice-pres­i­dent for train­ing and se­lec­tion, said: “I’m very happy that they are break­ing records... It’s not a SEA Games qual­i­fy­ing mark, but what it does is that</p>
    <p>it serves as en­cour­age­ment for ath­letes to con­tinue plug­ging away in their bid for the SEA Games.”</p>
    <p>Chong is con­fi­dent that if given proper guid­ance, it is pos­si­ble for Phoa or Wang to qual­ify for next year’s SEA Games in Viet­nam, or the 2023 edi­tion.</p>
    <p>He hopes to work with the throwers twice a day, but that is cur­rently not fea­si­ble as the ath­letes have other com­mit­ments such as school. They now train once a day for about two hours.</p>
    <p>“It will be a bonus to see both of them in the SEA Games be­cause it will be a very big jump from 60, 61 to go to 70 – that’s 10m in a year. In some cases, when over­seas ath­letes jump that dis­tance, they likely have twice daily train­ing ses­sions.”</p>
    <p>From next year, Chong will be­gin to work with Stu­art Car­law, a coach from the United Kingdom, for throw­ing events as part of the coaches’ ed­u­ca­tion ses­sions.</p>
    <p>They take the time to train on their own out­side of nor­mal train­ing hours. It’s all be­cause of their per­sis­tence, train­ing and pas­sion.</p>
