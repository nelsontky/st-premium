    <p>One of the most com­pelling virtues of the re­cent 2219: Fu­tures Imag­ined ex­hibit at the ArtS­cience Mu­seum was that it made a rad­i­cal sce­nario – Sin­ga­pore as a high-rise Venice, with canals, hang­ing gar­dens and ver­ti­cal farm­ing – ap­pear en­tirely plau­si­ble. But 2219 could well be 2119, or even sooner.</p>
    <p>I have fre­quently no­ticed this para­dox in sce­nario-plan­ning ex­er­cises. A decade ago, while ad­vis­ing the US Na­tional In­tel­li­gence Coun­cil’s Global Trends 2030 pro­gramme, the team posited a fu­ture in which ur­ban­i­sa­tion, tech­nol­ogy and cap­i­tal ac­cu­mu­la­tion had brought about a land­scape in which cities, fed­eral gov­ern­ments, pro­vin­cial au­thor­i­ties and cor­po­rate sup­ply chains com­pete for in­flu­ence across var­i­ous en­claves and le­gal zones. My re­sponse: This is the world of 2013, not 2030.</p>
    <p>From re­mote work to travel bub­bles, the pan­demic has taught us to speed up our ac­cep­tance of the “next nor­mal”. Sin­ga­pore’s own “30 by 30” plan to gen­er­ate 30 per cent of its fish and veg­etable con­sump­tion through lo­cal aquaponic farm­ing by 2030 has been brought for­ward to 2023.</p>
    <p>When con­jur­ing up vi­sions for the Asia of 2050, two lessons from count­less sce­nario ex­er­cises are es­sen­tial to bear in mind.</p>
    <p>LESSONS FROM SCE­NAR­IOS</p>
    <p>First, we must be imag­i­na­tive. His­tory is ac­cel­er­at­ing. Tech­nolo­gies from ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to gene ther­apy are evolv­ing far more rapidly than we pre­vi­ously thought, and are col­lid­ing in novel and un­ex­pected ways.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, we must em­brace com­plex­ity. The chain re­ac­tions across eco­nom­ics, geopol­i­tics, cli­mate and de­mo­graph­ics make a mock­ery of lin­ear pro­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>Two decades ago, when the United States in­vaded Afghanista­n and Iraq, pun­dits were quick to de­clare an eter­nal ex­ten­sion of Amer­i­can “hy­per­power”. Yet here we are, nearly 20 years into the spec­tac­u­lar dele­git­i­ma­tion of the An­glo-Amer­i­can sys­tem.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Europe, which even West­ern an­a­lysts dis­missed as a geopo­lit­i­cal mu­seum, has em­barked on a fis­cal com­pact to match its mon­e­tary union, trades more with Asia than it does with the US, and leads the world in cli­mate-re­silient in­vest­ments. Any holis­tic ap­proach to mea­sur­ing power and in­flu­ence does more than look at mil­i­tary as­sets.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, in re­cent years, com­men­ta­tors have been far too quick to project that China’s Belt and Road Ini­tia­tive (BRI) her­alded the in­evitable re­turn of the Ming dy­nasty’s trib­u­tary sys­tem of hi­er­ar­chy across Asia. But rather than res­ur­rect a Chi­nese ver­sion of the Bri­tish East In­dia Com­pany (an­other com­mon anal­ogy for the BRI), strong back­lash has al­ready eroded China’s abil­ity to co­erce.</p>
    <p>Ma­jor pow­ers such as the US, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and Europe have erected sig­nif­i­cant bar­ri­ers to Chi­nese in­vest­ment while de­mand­ing re­cip­ro­cal mar­ket ac­cess, formed a “Quad” coali­tion of navies to main­tain a free and open Indo-Pa­cific re­gion, and are work­ing with weaker states to of­fer al­ter­na­tive life­lines of credit to di­lute China’s “debt trap” diplo­macy.</p>
    <p>Both cases em­body geopo­lit­i­cal com­plex­ity: The re­ac­tion to one power’s ac­tions proves to be more de­ci­sive than that power’s orig­i­nal ac­tion. What it took the Bri­tish nearly 300 years to learn, China is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing in the span of three years. China has told us what it wants its place to be in 2049. His­tory will have a dif­fer­ent opin­ion.</p>
    <p>En­vi­sion­ing Asia’s fu­ture by way of lin­ear pro­jec­tion is there­fore dan­ger­ous and so too is us­ing static analo­gies and an­ti­quated the­o­ries. West­ern his­tory teaches that unipo­lar orders are more sta­ble, but Asia’s 4,000 years of his­tory have been al­most ex­clu­sively mul­ti­po­lar, with di­verse and dis­persed civil­i­sa­tions fo­cus­ing on com­mer­cial ties and cul­tural ex­change rather than con­flict.</p>
    <p>The most re­cent power to vi­o­late that norm was 20th-cen­tury Ja­pan, an ex­pe­ri­ence of which China is well aware. In­deed, with more neigh­bours than any other coun­try in the world, China is even more deeply en­meshed in the re­gion and knows it can­not win a 14-front war.</p>
    <p>Ex­treme sce­nar­ios grab head­lines: US Hege­mony 2.0, China Takes Over the World, New Cold War, or World War III. Take your pick. But if global his­tory is any guide, we would be bet­ter served by draw­ing on prece­dents from Asia’s broad past while in­fus­ing dis­rup­tive el­e­ments com­ing at us from the fu­ture.</p>
    <p>As the world grav­i­tates more to­wards re­gional con­structs than fric­tion­less glob­al­i­sa­tion, the most salient tem­plate harkens back to the pre-colo­nial world, namely the 15th- and 16th-cen­tury Afro-Eurasian sys­tem that spanned the In­dian Ocean.</p>
    <p>Today, once again, the In­dian Ocean re­gion is the cen­tre of grav­ity in global trade, link­ing highly com­ple­men­tary re­gions from East Africa to Asean in an ever more fluid mi­lieu. This is com­ple­mented by the re­vival of an­other pre-colo­nial arte­fact, the “Silk Roads” span­ning from Ara­bia to the Far East.</p>
    <p>The res­ur­rec­tion of this trans-re­gional con­nec­tiv­ity has far more to do with the col­lapse of the Soviet Union three decades ago than the rise of China, hence we can ex­pect these Silk Roads to flour­ish in all di­rec­tions, ir­re­spec­tive of China’s in­flu­ence over the Asian sys­tem.</p>
    <p>VARI­ABLES FOR THE FU­TURE</p>
    <p>Now let us in­fuse some un­prece­dented vari­ables into our con­struct of the Asian fu­ture.</p>
    <p>First, de­mo­graph­ics. The world is headed not to­wards ram­pant over­pop­u­la­tion as many feared two decades ago, but rather a plateau of per­haps no more than nine bil­lion peo­ple – fol­lowed by a rather pre­cip­i­tous col­lapse. China, Ja­pan, South Korea, Sin­ga­pore and other Asian na­tions are age­ing rapidly and have fallen below re­place­ment fer­til­ity lev­els. Their need to im­port for­eign man­power is ev­i­dent in Ja­pan, which is now home to nearly three mil­lion foreigners, in­clud­ing le­gions of young Viet­namese and In­di­ans. The coun­try least known for wel­com­ing out­siders has be­come an im­mi­grant mag­net.</p>
    <p>China too has a very cau­tious ap­proach to­wards im­mi­grants, yet is also heav­ily im­port­ing South-east Asians to fill its labour short­ages. We are wit­ness­ing a new era of Asian mass mi­gra­tions from young to old so­ci­eties, re­in­forc­ing the melt­ing pot na­ture of the re­gion.</p>
    <p>An­other driver of this de­mo­graphic swirl: cli­mate change. The es­ti­mated 10 mil­lion In­done­sians work­ing in Malaysia al­ready rep­re­sent the re­gion’s largest cross-bor­der com­mu­nity. What will hap­pen as ris­ing sea lev­els en­gulf In­done­sia’s coast­lines, drought scorches its agri­cul­ture, and heat ef­fects broil its pop­u­la­tion?</p>
    <p>No place is immune to cli­mate ef­fects, but In­ter­gov­ern­men­tal Panel on Cli­mate Change mod­els are more favourable to­wards up­per penin­su­lar Malaysia, Myan­mar, Ja­pan and Mon­go­lia than equa­to­rial lat­i­tudes. We should not be sur­prised to find tens of mil­lions of Bangladesh­is in north­ern Myan­mar, and per­haps hun­dreds of mil­lions of Chi­nese in Siberia decades from now.</p>
    <p>Today’s tech­no­log­i­cal break­throughs be­fit a world of peo­ple more on the move. We are mov­ing from re­liance on heavy and pol­lut­ing hy­dro­car­bon en­ergy to­wards more lo­calised re­new­able and al­ter­na­tive re­sources such as wind and so­lar ones. Thou­sands of satel­lites cir­cu­late in or­bit and portable 5G base sta­tions can be erected any­where. A large share of the work­force is made up of telecom­muters. There may still be ten­sions across Asia and glob­ally. Armed in­ter­ven­tions and land grabs may be the new ter­ri­to­rial geopol­i­tics. Ac­cess to cli­mate oases may be re­stricted while oth­ers scav­enge in a more neo-me­di­ae­val land­scape. Bio-ther­a­pies and other med­i­cal treat­ments could ex­ac­er­bate in­equal­ity, both eco­nomic and ge­netic.</p>
    <p>SIN­GA­PORE IN A CHANG­ING WORLD</p>
    <p>Where does all of this leave Sin­ga­pore? The more un­pre­dictable the fu­ture ap­pears, the more in­di­vid­u­als seek refuge in is­lands of sta­bil­ity, well-gov­erned en­claves that of­fer the virtues of se­cu­rity and con­nec­tion hu­mans in­nately de­sire. Al­ready we have enough hous­ing stock to sup­port a pop­u­la­tion of seven mil­lion or more if we so choose, and de­mo­graphic tran­si­tion makes higher im­mi­gra­tion an even­tual ne­ces­sity.</p>
    <p>At the same time, be­com­ing a leader in sec­tors rang­ing from ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing to vac­cines re­quires fresh minds and knowl­edge­able tech­ni­cians, as well as man­power to ex­port in­no­va­tions to a global so­ci­ety that con­stantly craves up­grades.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s suc­cess to date is owed in no small part to be­ing pre­pared for a wide range of sce­nar­ios, equally para­noid about both threats im­plied in the proverb “come hell or high wa­ter”. The fu­ture is al­most never ei­ther/or; it is far more of­ten both/and. That means it is nei­ther all utopia nor all dystopia, not all hy­per-glob­al­i­sa­tion, nor all hy­per-lo­cal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>Our global sys­tem evolves the way hu­man­ity does, not through grand de­sign or ran­dom ac­ci­dent but by adap­ta­tion to chang­ing re­al­i­ties. The faster we re­act to an ac­cel­er­at­ing world, the bet­ter our chances of shap­ing the fu­ture to our ben­e­fit.</p>
