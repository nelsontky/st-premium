    <p>When 2gether The Se­ries aired in Thai­land ear­lier this year, it was a hit which turned its leads Win Metawin Opasi­amka­jorn and</p>
    <p>Bright Vachi­rawit Chivaa­ree into stars. They graced mag­a­zine covers, ap­peared on va­ri­ety shows and en­dorsed ev­ery­thing from sk­in­care prod­ucts to snacks.</p>
    <p>Strik­ing while they are red hot, the five-episode se­quel Still 2gether pre­miered in Thai­land and on pro­duc­tion house GMMTV’s YouTube chan­nel last Fri­day.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the orig­i­nal se­ries – based on the 2019 novel of the same name by Jit­tiRain – has been picked up by Net­flix, in­tro­duc­ing it to a wider au­di­ence.</p>
    <p>To ward off the un­wanted at­ten­tions of an­other male col­lege stu­dent, Tine (Win) de­cides to get the coolly aloof gui­tar player</p>
    <p>Sarawat (Bright) to be his pre­tend boyfriend. After an ini­tial show of re­luc­tance, Sarawat agrees.</p>
    <p>Against a back­drop of ir­re­sistible tracks from Thai indie pop duo Scrubb, Tine starts to fall for Sarawat.</p>
    <p>As far as premises go, the “will you be my fake boyfriend” one is not par­tic­u­larly orig­i­nal.</p>
    <p>It was the set-up for Love Sick (2014 to 2015), the Thai school ro­mance which paved the way for all the oth­ers.</p>
    <p>But thanks to the cast, 2gether works.</p>
    <p>Tine is chirpy and some­what clue­less in the ro­mance depart­ment, de­spite his pre­vi­ous string of girl­friends, and rookie ac­tor Win brings charm and en­ergy to the role.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Bright (So­cial Death Vote, 2018) is fun to watch as the curt and cut­ting Sarawat. At first, he seems to barely tol­er­ate Tine, but ev­ery now and then, he would let slip a lit­tle smile that be­trays his true feel­ings.</p>
    <p>And the ac­tor is not just an on-screen mu­si­cian. The mu­sic video of him singing the end­ing theme Kan Goo (a play on Koo Gan, which means “to­gether” in Thai) has crossed 27 mil­lion views on YouTube.</p>
    <p>Win and Bright have great chem­istry as their char­ac­ters tease, bicker and nav­i­gate their way around a fake re­la­tion­ship that be­comes some­thing more.</p>
    <p>Sur­round­ing them are friends who both help and hin­der the pair, in­clud­ing Man (Mike Chin­narat Si­riphongcha­walit), whose crush turns out to have a con­nec­tion to Tine.</p>
    <p>From a light-hearted romp, view­ers cross over to the dark tale of mur­der and mys­tery that is K-drama Flower Of Evil.</p>
    <p>On the sur­face, Baek Hee-sung (Lee Joon-gi) seems to have it all. He is a metal crafts­man who is hap­pily mar­ried to Cha Ji-won (Moon Chae-won) and they have a cute lit­tle daugh­ter. But Hee-sung is ac­tu­ally Do Hyun-soo, the son of a se­rial killer, and on the run since he was ac­cused of mur­der­ing the vil­lage fore­man.</p>
    <p>When his de­tec­tive wife in­ves­ti­gates a copy­cat mur­der and re­porter Kim Moo-jin (Seo Hyun-woo) be­gins sniff­ing around, Hyun-soo’s care­fully con­structed fa­cade threat­ens to crum­ble.</p>
    <p>Flower Of Evil re­unites Crim­i­nal Minds (2017) co-stars Lee and Moon, ex­cept this time, they are on op­po­site sides of the law.</p>
    <p>While Ji-won is an ob­ser­vant de­tec­tive, she has some­how missed the signs that all is not quite right with her per­fect hus­band. Or is it that peo­ple sim­ply do not see what is right in front of them?</p>
    <p>Lee has the more chal­leng­ing role. A scene of him learn­ing to ex­press hap­pi­ness sets off alarm bells, but is he merely lack­ing in em­pa­thy or a murderous psy­chopath?</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Kim Chul-gyu (Emer­gency Cou­ple, 2014) and scriptwrit­er Yoo Jung-hee (Naked Fire­man, 2017) have to pull off a del­i­cate bal­anc­ing act: dish out enough in­for­ma­tion so that au­di­ences are sat­is­fied, yet not too much, so as to keep them guess­ing.</p>
    <p>There are se­crets to be un­earthed and thrills to be had. In the third episode, Hyun-soo is snoop­ing in an apart­ment when his wife and a team of cops sud­denly bang on the door. A de­li­ciously tense scene fol­lows, though it is re­solved too con­ve­niently.</p>
    <p>The big­ger prob­lem is that after the first few episodes, it seems fairly clear what kind of man Hyun-soo re­ally is.</p>
