    <p>Mau­r­izio Sarri was in charge the last time Chelsea were in pole po­si­tion in the Premier League in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
    <p>The Blues may not be top af­ter the week­end is over, but Tammy Abra­ham be­lieves his side are firmly in the ti­tle hunt fol­low­ing their 2-0 Premier League away win over New­cas­tle yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The England for­ward put the game to bed in the se­cond half af­ter an early own goal by Fed­erico Fer­nan­dez set up the vic­tory at St</p>
    <p>James’ Park, pro­vi­sion­ally mov­ing them to first in the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>Chelsea had won only once in their pre­vi­ous seven vis­its to New­cas­tle but, de­spite the com­plaints of an early kick-off – which ruled out Thi­ago Silva, who ar­rived back in England from in­ter­na­tional duty on Thurs­day – the vis­i­tors were sel­dom trou­bled.</p>
    <p>The hosts were not helped by Fer­nan­dez’s howler – since his de­but in 2014, no player has scored more own goals than the Ar­gen­tinian de­fender (five).</p>
    <p>With Mag­pies’ top scorer Cal­lum Wil­son, who has net­ted six of their 10 league goals this sea­son, miss­ing with a ham­string in­jury, the hosts looked tooth­less in at­tack.</p>
    <p>Chelsea handed An­to­nio Rudi­ger his first league start of the cam­paign in place of Silva and could have scored more than the two goals. The se­cond came as Timo Werner sprinted clear be­fore slip­ping a pass to Abra­ham, who calmly fin­ished past Karl Dar­low.</p>
    <p>Sean Longstaff hit the bar from long range late on, but there was to be no come­back, mean­ing Frank Lam­pard’s side are now un­beaten in nine games in all com­pe­ti­tions.</p>
    <p>With five clean-sheets in their last six matches and a third straight league win, Abra­ham said it was the per­fect way to start a hec­tic pe­riod lead­ing up to Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>“It’s a fan­tas­tic re­sult, we had to dig deep as it’s never an easy place to come. It was 1-0 for a very long time, they cre­ated a few chances, but so did we and we de­fended well,” he told BT Sport.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t let the in­ter­na­tional break dis­tract us. We had to come out all guns blaz­ing, we did that. It’s a massive three points.</p>
    <p>“Th­ese games are al­ways tricky when you can’t get that se­cond goal. It’s very easy to drop your head and lose con­fi­dence, but we didn’t do that and kept go­ing.</p>
    <p>“No pres­sure (be­ing in the ti­tle mix). That’s where we want to be, we just need to keep get­ting the three points and hope­fully, we will stay up there.”</p>
    <p>Lam­pard agreed his side “put the game away with a profession­al per­for­mance” but, with only nine topflight games played, it was far too early to make any pre­dic­tions.</p>
    <p>“We played well, the re­sult is key be­cause the Premier League is tough and re­lent­less. I thought the lads dealt with the chal­lenge to­day and I’m re­ally pleased,” the Blues boss said.</p>
    <p>“It’s pleas­ing, but I’m not go­ing to get ex­cited about be­ing at the top of the ta­ble for five min­utes.</p>
    <p>“We dom­i­nated the game, we could have scored more goals. But the lads dealt with it very well. We lost here last year, so it’s good pro­gres­sion to come here and get the right re­sult.</p>
    <p>“We have to think about the big pic­ture and there’s im­prove­ment and work to be done. We need the squad, we need ev­ery­body.</p>
    <p>“It’s a gru­elling sea­son and it’s good for the team’s con­fi­dence we got an­other clean sheet.”</p>
    <p>AIM­ING HIGH</p>
    <p>No pres­sure (be­ing in the ti­tle mix). That’s where we want to be.</p>
    <p>TAMMY ABRA­HAM, Chelsea striker, ex­em­pli­fy­ing the con­fi­dence within the squad. The last time the west Lon­don club were top of the Premier League was un­der Mau­r­izio Sarri in Septem­ber 2018.</p>
