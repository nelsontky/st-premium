    <p>Three water fea­ture main­te­nance com­pa­nies – CU Water Ser­vices, Crys­ta­l­ene Prod­uct (S) and Crys­tal Clear Con­trac­tor – have been fined by the com­pe­ti­tion watch­dog for con­duct­ing car­tel-style bid-rig­ging ac­tiv­i­ties for close to a decade. The bid rig­ging con­cerned 521 con­tracts and 220 cus­tomers, in­clud­ing ho­tels like the Shangri-La.</p>
    <p>Three water fea­ture main­te­nance com­pa­nies have been fined by the com­pe­ti­tion watch­dog for con­duct­ing car­tel-style bid-rig­ging ac­tiv­i­ties for close to a decade.</p>
    <p>CU Water Ser­vices, Crys­ta­l­ene Prod­uct (S) and Crys­tal Clear Con­trac­tor ex­changed in­for­ma­tion and co­or­di­nated their bids for main­te­nance ser­vices for swim­ming pools, spas, foun­tains and other water fea­tures at de­vel­op­ments such as ho­tels and con­do­mini­ums.</p>
    <p>The il­le­gal bid rig­ging con­cerned 521 con­tracts and 220 cus­tomers, and took place be­tween Oc­to­ber 2008 and June 2017. Cus­tomers in­cluded ho­tels like the Shangri-La and Grand Copthorne Waterfront, as well as the man­age­ment cor­po­ra­tions and man­ag­ing agents of con­do­mini­ums.</p>
    <p>For this col­lu­sion, the Com­pe­ti­tion and Con­sumer Com­mis­sion of Singapore (CCCS) fined CU Water $308,680. Crys­ta­l­ene and Crys­tal Clear were fined $41,541 and $68,793, re­spec­tively, af­ter re­ceiv­ing a “le­niency dis­count” to have their fi­nan­cial penal­ties re­duced be­cause they came for­ward to share in­for­ma­tion on the cases.</p>
    <p>The watch­dog be­gan l ook­ing into the three com­pa­nies’ prac­tices af­ter a tip-off by a whistle­blower in July 2017. It served the com­pa­nies with le­gal doc­u­ments in March this year to say they il­le­gally rigged their bids in ten­ders called by pri­vately owned de­vel­op­ments.</p>
    <p>In Novem­ber 2017, CCCS con­ducted unan­nounced in­spec­tions at the com­pa­nies’ premises and in­ter­viewed key per­son­nel.</p>
    <p>At that point, it re­ceived l eniency ap­pli­ca­tions from Crys­tal Clear and Crys­ta­l­ene.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions found that there were agree­ments be­tween CU Water and Crys­ta­l­ene, as well as be­tween CU Water and Crys­tal Clear, to col­lude in their bids for ten­ders.</p>
    <p>In­stead of sub­mit­ting ten­der bids in­de­pen­dently, one com­pany would re­quest a sup­port­ing quo­ta­tion from an­other, which it be­lieved would be higher than its own. The sec­ond com­pany would then give the higher quo­ta­tion to the cus­tomer. At times, one com­pany would spec­ify a price for the other to use in the sup­port­ing quo­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>Th­ese ar­range­ments meant the com­pa­nies were able to sub­mit higher-priced quo­ta­tions across the board. There was no com­pet­i­tive pres­sure to sub­mit their best of­fers to the cus­tomers, said the watch­dog. Cus­tomers were un­able to ob­tain of­fers that best met their re­quire­ments and pro­vided the best value, it added.</p>
    <p>The ten­ders af­fected by the ar­range­ments be­tween CU Water and Crys­ta­l­ene were called from Oct 11, 2008, to May 29, 2017, while those af­fected by the agree­ments be­tween CU Water and Crys­tal Clear were called from Aug 20, 2011, to June 16, 2017.</p>
    <p>CCCS chief ex­ec­u­tive Sia Aik Kor said: “Bid rig­ging is one of the most harm­ful types of anti-com­pet­i­tive con­duct as it dis­torts the com­pet­i­tive bid­ding process, thereby pre­vent­ing cus­tomers from get­ting the best value for their ten­ders.”</p>
    <p>Ms Sia added that any busi­ness that is ap­proached to join in an­ti­com­pet­i­tive agree­ments should im­me­di­ately re­ject the ap­proach and pub­licly dis­tance it­self from any such dis­cus­sions.</p>
    <p>She urged busi­nesses that are in­volved in a car­tel to con­sider mak­ing a le­niency ap­pli­ca­tion as soon as pos­si­ble. “The first busi­ness to come for­ward and pro­vide ev­i­dence of the car­tel ac­tiv­i­ties be­fore CCCS com­mences a for­mal in­ves­ti­ga­tion will be given a full waiver of the fi­nan­cial penalty,” she said.</p>
    <p>“In ad­di­tion, busi­nesses that ad­mit li­a­bil­ity for their in­fring­ing con­duct un­der the Fast Track Pro­ce­dure will be el­i­gi­ble for a re­duc­tion of their fi­nan­cial penalty.”</p>
    <p>HARM­FUL BE­HAV­IOUR</p>
