    <p>The ur­gency i n tack­ling the Covid-19 pan­demic has seen a quick­ened process in de­vel­op­ing and ap­prov­ing a vac­cine, but ex­perts say mul­ti­ple steps have been taken to en­sure that any vac­cine rolled out in Sin­ga­pore is safe.</p>
    <p>The first ship­ment of Covid-19 vac­cines ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore on Mon­day night, mark­ing the first time the coun­try is buy­ing in large quan­ti­ties drugs that have been ap­proved for use in a pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The vac­cine de­vel­oped by Pfizer and its Ger­man part­ner BioNTech was granted au­tho­ri­sa­tion for use here by the Health Sciences Au­thor­ity (HSA) un­der the Pan­demic Spe­cial Ac­cess Route.</p>
    <p>It is so far the only vac­cine ap­proved by the HSA, although oth­ers are be­ing stud­ied.</p>
    <p>But even dur­ing these un­prece­dented times, steps have been taken to en­sure the safety of vac­cines that will be used here, said two ex­perts at a press con­fer­ence on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Tan Say Beng and Pro­fes­sor Ben­jamin Seet, both on an ex­pert panel that ad­vises the Gov­ern­ment on ther­a­peu­tics and vac­cines, pointed to nu­mer­ous safety checks along the vac­cine devel­op­ment process.</p>
    <p>First, the data must show safety in an­i­mal stud­ies be­fore the vac­cine is tested on hu­mans.</p>
    <p>Data from the clin­i­cal tri­als is also re­viewed by the HSA when it as­sesses whether to ap­prove a vac­cine for use here.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan, who is ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of the Min­istry of Health’s Na­tional Med­i­cal Re­search Coun­cil, said: “Dur­ing the whole process, there are many vac­cine can­di­dates, and many may drop out along the way.</p>
    <p>“Some an­i­mal stud­ies show that (a vac­cine) may not be safe enough, for ex­am­ple, while oth­ers make it to hu­man stud­ies but they don’t make it through all the dif­fer­ent phases of clin­i­cal tri­als.”</p>
    <p>He added: “So you can think of it as there be­ing mul­ti­ple safety checks all along the way.”</p>
    <p>The first two phases of clin­i­cal tri­als, known as early-phase tri­als, are mainly car­ried out among smaller groups of up to hun­dreds of vol­un­teers to test the safety and ef­fi­cacy of a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>In these stages, re­searchers look out for dan­ger­ous side ef­fects and an­a­lyse pa­tient sam­ples to see how the hu­man im­mune sys­tem is re­spond­ing to the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>Phase three tri­als are much larger, usu­ally in­volv­ing thou</p>
    <p>sands to tens of thou­sands of peo­ple. These are of­ten held across mul­ti­ple ju­ris­dic­tions or coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Prof Tan said: “Many agen­cies in many coun­tries are con­fi­dent that the clin­i­cal trial process was abided by, even though things were quick­ened in terms of ur­gency. It was not at risk of com­pro­mis­ing the in­tegrity of the study.”</p>
    <p>For in­stance, phase three tri­als must be sized cor­rectly so that the re­sults are rep­re­sen­ta­tive of a larger group, he said.</p>
    <p>The phase three trial of the Pfizer-BioNTech vac­cine in­volved over 43,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>An­other Covid-19 vac­cine front run­ner, de­vel­oped by Moderna, had a phase three trial in­volv­ing more than 30,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>But re­spond­ing to a ques­tion on why other re­ac­tions to the Pfiz­erBioNTech vac­cine – such as se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions re­ported in the United States, for in­stance – were picked up only af­ter those tri­als, Prof Seet, who over­sees the ex­pert panel, said some re­ac­tions were very rare.</p>
    <p>Such re­ac­tions are not unique to Covid-19 vac­cines, but ap­ply to all types of drugs or shots, he added.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause some side ef­fects are very rare, you may need to in­volve hun­dreds of thou­sands, or some­times even a mil­lion or two mil­lion peo­ple, be­fore you ac­tu­ally see these very, very rare events, and the only way you can pick that up is ac­tu­ally through post-im­ple­men­ta­tion (mon­i­tor­ing),” he said.</p>
    <p>That is why the Gov­ern­ment will con­tinue to mon­i­tor the sit­u­a­tion as the vac­cine is rolled out here.</p>
    <p>But Prof Seet, who is deputy group chief ex­ec­u­tive for ed­u­ca­tion and re­search at the Na­tional Health­care Group, noted that not all side ef­fects were dan­ger­ous.</p>
    <p>Safety is about whether a vac­cine or drug will cause ac­tual harm to an in­di­vid­ual, he said.</p>
    <p>Tol­er­a­bil­ity, on the other hand, refers to ef­fects like a fever or headache af­ter a shot.</p>
    <p>“So that is quite dif­fer­ent from safety. Some peo­ple will ex­pe­ri­ence some of these side ef­fects – but that doesn’t af­fect over­all safety,” he said.</p>
