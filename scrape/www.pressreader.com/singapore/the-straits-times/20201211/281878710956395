    <p>WASH­ING­TON • A pro­to­type of the fu­ture gi­ant SpaceX rocket, Star­ship, which the com­pany hopes will be­come its go-to for Mars mis­sions, has crashed in a fiery ex­plo­sion dur­ing a test launch along the Texas coast.</p>
    <p>But the com­pany line was up­beat as a live stream of Wed­nes­day’s launch dis­played on-screen mes­sages such as “AWE­SOME TEST. CON­GRATS STAR­SHIP TEAM!” and “Mars, here we come!!”</p>
    <p>SpaceX founder, Tesla’s Elon Musk, tweeted just min­utes after the flight, ex­plain­ing that a too-fast land­ing speed was to blame for the crash. He re­counted the suc­cess­ful parts of the rocket’s short l ate af­ter­noon trip: the take-off, the change of po­si­tion in flight and its (pre-ex­plo­sion) pre­cise land­ing tra­jec­tory.</p>
    <p>“We got all the data we needed! Con­grats SpaceX team,” he said in his tweet.</p>
    <p>The test launch took off and as­cended prop­erly in a seem­ingly straight line, be­fore one and then another of its en­gines went out. After 4 min­utes and 45 sec­onds of flight, its third en­gine ex­tin­guished and the rocket be­gan its de­scent in its ex­pected po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The en­gines were restarted just sec­onds be­fore land­ing in an ef­fort to slow the ship, but it crashed hard into the earth.</p>
    <p>Smaller pro­to­types have al­ready blasted off sev­eral hun­dred me­tres into the air for less than a minute as part of a se­ries of tests aimed at de­vel­op­ing the next gen­er­a­tion of rock­ets from the firm.</p>
    <p>After sev­eral aborted at­tempts this week, the flight was livestream­ed on the @SpaceX Twit­ter ac­count.</p>
    <p>The test flight had been planned to check the huge metal body of SN8 (Star­ship No. 8) and its three en­gines for their aero­dy­namism, in­clud­ing dur­ing the ship’s re­turn to Earth – which happens ver­ti­cally, in the same vein as SpaceX’s pioneer­ing Fal­con 9 rocket.</p>
    <p>“With a test such as this, suc­cess is not mea­sured by com­ple­tion of spe­cific ob­jec­tives but rather how much we can learn, which will in­form and im­prove the prob­a­bil­ity of suc­cess in the fu­ture as SpaceX rapidly ad­vances devel­op­ment of Star­ship,” the firm said on its web­site, im­ply­ing even be­fore the launch that an ex­plo­sion or crash would not mean a failed mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Con­struc­tion on SN9, the next pro­to­type, is al­most fin­ished.</p>
    <p>The ex­per­i­men­tal flights are tak­ing place in a nearly de­serted part of south­ern Texas on the Gulf of Mex­ico near the United States’ bor­der with Mex­ico – an area empty enough that any flight mal­func­tion would be un­likely to cause phys­i­cal or prop­erty dam­age.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk re­cently said he plans to move to the vast south­ern US state from Cal­i­for­nia.</p>
    <p>Any fu­ture com­pleted Star­ship rocket will be equipped with 37 en­gines in­stead of nine, and will mea­sure 120m tall and be ca­pa­ble of car­ry­ing 100 tonnes of cargo into or­bit around the Earth.</p>
    <p>Mr Musk hopes to be able to one day launch sev­eral of these space ships to Mars, though they could be use­ful even in the short term as the Na­tional Aero­nau­tics and Space Ad­min­is­tra­tion eyes re-es­tab­lish­ing an on­go­ing pres­ence on the Moon in 2024.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese bil­lion­aire Yusaku Maezawa is sched­uled to pay an undis­closed sum to take Star­ship for a spin around the Moon in 2023 – at the ear­li­est.</p>
    <p>The test flight had been planned to check the huge metal body of SN8 (Star­ship No. 8) and its three en­gines for their aero­dy­namism, in­clud­ing dur­ing the ship’s re­turn to Earth.</p>
