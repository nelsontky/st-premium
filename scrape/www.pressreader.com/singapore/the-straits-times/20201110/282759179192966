    <p>HONG KONG • Both were said to be good friends, with their friend­ship go­ing back to 2012, when they took part in the Miss Hong Kong Pageant.</p>
    <p>But it looks like ac­tresses Jac­que­line Wong and Rox­anne Tong are on chummy terms no more – at least not on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>Ob­ser­vant ne­ti­zens re­cently dis­cov­ered that Wong, 31, and Tong, 33, no longer fol­low each other on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>Some won­der if this was be­cause Tong had not only taken over Wong’s role in a TVB drama, but also re­placed her as the girl­friend of ac­tor Ken­neth Ma in real life.</p>
    <p>Spec­u­la­tion over the two ac­tresses’ re­la­tion­ship comes as the Hong Kong me­dia re­ported over the week­end that broad­caster TVB was likely to ter­mi­nate Wong’s con­tract.</p>
    <p>In April last year, Wong was caught in a cheat­ing scan­dal with singer Andy Hui, who is mar­ried to Can­topop diva Sammi Cheng.</p>
    <p>The tele­vi­sion se­ri­als that Wong had acted in were quickly canned, with her role in tele­vi­sion se­rial Foren­sic He­roes IV taken over by Tong.</p>
    <p>Wong’s then boyfriend Ma, 46, broke up with her af­ter the scan­dal. In June this year, he ad­mit­ted that he and Tong were dat­ing.</p>
    <p>Wong con­grat­u­lated the cou­ple, but it seems she is no longer close to Tong, who told the me­dia later that they had not kept in touch since Wong left Hong Kong for the United States af­ter the scan­dal.</p>
    <p>Asked about Wong un­fol­low­ing her and even block­ing her on so­cial me­dia, Tong said she was un­aware of it and would l ook i nto the mat­ter.</p>
    <p>Ma, who does not fol­low Wong on In­sta­gram, said he was un­aware of the mat­ter too.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier, it seemed as if things were look­ing up for Wong.</p>
    <p>Two of her canned drama se­ri­als – Find­ing Her Voice and Hand­maid­ens United – were be­lat­edly re­leased late last year, with a third one – The Of­fliners – fi­nally sched­uled to be broad­cast in Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>But Ori­en­tal Daily News re­ported over the week­end that TVB made the de­ci­sion to ter­mi­nate her con­tract as it con­cluded that Wong’s im­age had not im­proved 18 months af­ter the scan­dal and was un­likely to im­prove soon.</p>
    <p>While Wong is still un­der con­tract and on no-pay leave, TVB de­cided that it is bet­ter to let her go now, given the wors­en­ing econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Wong nei­ther con­firmed nor de­nied the re­port when ap­proached by the Hong Kong me­dia and sim­ply said she would in­form the me­dia if there were up­dates.</p>
