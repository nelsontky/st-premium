    <p>Sin­ga­pore shares capped a rather broody week on a flat note.</p>
    <p>The key Straits Times In­dex (STI) was down two points or 0.08 per cent at 2,490.09 yes­ter­day, af­ter a re­newed rout in United States mega-cap tech­nol­ogy shares.</p>
    <p>The mar­ket’s key barom­e­ter lost 0.8 per cent over the week on wor­ries that the US tech bears could por­tend some­thing deeper. For one, will the melt­down turn more broad-based and en­gulf other stocks and as­set classes?</p>
    <p>Dashed Covid-19 vac­cine hopes – seen as vi­tal to jump-start­ing the global eco­nomic re­cov­ery – and a bear­ish oil mar­ket, plus the like­li­hood of a no-deal hard Brexit, added to the un­cer­tainty, curb­ing traders’ risk ap­petite.</p>
    <p>Across Asia, mar­kets in Ja­pan, Hong Kong, China, South Korea and Malaysia pock­eted gains de­spite Wall Street’s overnight fal­ter­ing, but Tai­wan and Aus­tralia ended in the red.</p>
    <p>FXTM an­a­lysts Luk­man Otunuga and Han Tan said in a note: “Look­ing ahead, there could be even more volatil­ity in store, with the quadruple witch­ing day for US mar­kets tak­ing place next Friday.”</p>
    <p>They noted that the fu­tures and op­tions on in­dices and stocks are set to meet their quar­terly ex­pi­ra­tion on Sept 18, which can trig­ger height­ened volatil­ity and a surge in trade vol­umes.</p>
    <p>The Euro­pean Cen­tral Bank kept rates un­changed at its pol­icy meeting on Thurs­day. And with that, all eyes will be on the US’ Fed­eral</p>
    <p>Open Mar­ket Com­mit­tee meeting next week.</p>
    <p>Over­all trad­ing vol­ume in the Sin­ga­pore mar­ket stood at 1.24 bil­lion shares worth $925.7 mil­lion. Among the STI con­stituents, 13 coun­ters were up and 11, down.</p>
    <p>Buck­ing the stock mar­ket’s over­all sour note, AEM Hold­ings jumped over 10 per cent to $3.63 af­ter it raised its FY2020 rev­enue guid­ance on the back of sales or­der vis­i­bil­ity and busi­ness out­look.</p>
    <p>Wil­mar In­ter­na­tional rose 0.7 per cent to $4.20. Citi Re­search said the re­cent price weak­ness could be tem­po­rary, as in­vestors await the fi­nal reg­u­la­tory nod for the muchawaite­d ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing of its Chi­nese arm.</p>
    <p>As­cen­das Reit closed un­changed at $3.27. Its man­ager said the day be­fore that the real es­tate in­vest­ment trust (Reit) had priced its $300 mil­lion green sub­or­di­nated per­pet­ual se­cu­ri­ties un­der its $7 bil­lion euro medium-term se­cu­ri­ties pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The se­cu­ri­ties will re­place the ex­ist­ing per­pet­ual se­cu­ri­ties, which are callable next month, and do not ma­te­ri­ally change the Reit’s credit met­rics, said Moody’s In­vestors Ser­vice.</p>
