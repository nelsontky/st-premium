    <p>Har­sha Kakar</p>
    <p>The States­man, In­dia</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Work­ing Mech­a­nism for Con­sul­ta­tion and Co­or­di­na­tion on Indo-China border af­fairs meet­ing on Aug 20, both sides is­sued vague and guarded state­ments.</p>
    <p>The In­dian statement made no men­tion of “progress” nor “early and com­plete dis­en­gage­ment”.</p>
    <p>It read: “The two sides had a can­did and in-depth ex­change of views on the ex­ist­ing sit­u­a­tion in the In­dia-China border ar­eas. They agreed to re­solve out­stand­ing is­sues in an ex­pe­di­tious man­ner and in ac­cor­dance with ex­ist­ing agree­ments and pro­to­cols.”</p>
    <p>Bei­jing com­mented that the meet­ing “pos­i­tively eval­u­ated the process made in the dis­en­gage­ment of front-line forces of the two coun­tries and agreed to con­sci­en­tiously im­ple­ment the con­sen­sus reached be­tween the two sides”. The Chi­nese am­bas­sador com­mented along sim­i­lar lines.</p>
    <p>Ev­i­dently, a stale­mate has been reached, with China stick­ing to its claim lines and plac­ing un­rea­son­able de­mands for with­drawal.</p>
    <p>In­dia has an­nounced that it would main­tain its forces in the re­gion till dis­en­gage­ment is com­plete. To that end, it has be­gun con­struct­ing ac­com­mo­da­tion for ad­di­tional forces de­ployed in the re­gion. The cur­rent sce­nario re­mains sta­ble, with equal force lev­els main­tained at a dis­tance to pre­vent re­cur­rence of any clashes.</p>
    <p>With its cur­rent de­ploy­ment in Ladakh, China has al­ready raised the costs for In­dia by ty­ing down ad­di­tional army for­ma­tions in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic im­pact on In­dia is high as it is com­pelled to al­lo­cate funds for de­fence pro­cure­ments, as well as for stock­ing and cloth­ing its forces through win­ters, de­spite funds be­ing needed for boost­ing the econ­omy and med­i­cal sup­port in view of the spread­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>The In­dian strat­egy of han­dling Chi­nese in­cur­sions has not changed since they com­menced decades ago. It is ba­si­cally to pre­vent China from ex­pand­ing by de­ploy­ing sim­i­lar force lev­els while hold­ing talks to re­solve the sit­u­a­tion. Each time the de­mand has been the same – the side which en­tered first must pull back first.</p>
    <p>China is now at­tempt­ing the strat­egy it adopted in the Sum­dorong Chu stand-off, where it sought equal with­drawal by both forces, with In­dia with­draw­ing within its own ter­ri­tory. In­dia has re­fused to com­ply with this de­mand.</p>
    <p>This oft-adopted strat­egy is cur­rently not work­ing, though In­dian strate­gists be­lieve it will at some stage. In­dia had ear­lier never adopted any other ac­tion to in­crease costs to China. This time, in re­tal­i­a­tion, it is seek­ing to raise the cost by ac­ti­vat­ing mul­ti­ple mea­sures, mainly eco­nomic and diplo­matic.</p>
    <p>Ba­si­cally, Delhi is con­vey­ing to Bei­jing that it can­not be busi­ness as usual if China does not back down and end the stand-off.</p>
    <p>In­dia may have to con­sider fur­ther op­tions to com­pel China to with­draw.</p>
    <p>Hasjim Djalal</p>
    <p>The Jakarta Post, In­done­sia</p>
    <p>In view of the com­plex is­sues of the South China Sea (SCS), I have sug­gested a 6+4+2 or 6+4+1+1 for­mat in the sense that the six Asean non-claimants to sovereignt­y over is­lands and fea­tures in the SCS (In­done­sia, Sin­ga­pore, Cam­bo­dia, Laos, Thai­land and Myan­mar), act­ing as fa­cil­i­ta­tors, should en­cour­age and in­vite the four Asean claimants (the Philip­pines, Brunei, Malaysia and Viet­nam) to sit down and ne­go­ti­ate the mat­ter with the two non-Asean claimants (China and Tai­wan), al­beit in­for­mally.</p>
    <p>The Asean chair­man could take the ini­tia­tive.</p>
    <p>The Jakarta In­for­mal Meet­ing of invit­ing the rel­e­vant par­ties dur­ing the Cam­bo­dian Con­flict in the 1980s to “in­for­mal cock­tail par­ties” in Bo­gor, West Java, and Jakarta could serve as an ex­am­ple.</p>
    <p>The re­ac­tion to this sug­ges­tion has been mixed, but I have not heard ob­jec­tions from the dis­putants.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, Asean as a group could and should con­tinue to in­duce China to agree to and to ac­cel­er­ate the for­mu­la­tion and agree­ment on the code of con­duct for the SCS on the ba­sis of the al­ready agreed Dec­la­ra­tion of Con­duct of 2002 and its “guide­lines” and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>In fact, In­done­sia has al­ready drafted a cer­tain Zero Draft for the code of con­duct.</p>
    <p>It would also be help­ful if the rel­e­vant Asean coun­tries could set­tle their own mar­itime bound­aries with their neigh­bours, par­tic­u­larly be­tween Malaysia and the Philip­pines, as al­ready in­di­cated by Malaysia and Brunei.</p>
    <p>The rel­e­vant par­ties in the SCS should clar­ify as pre­cisely as pos­si­ble the na­ture of their claims as well as the le­gal ba­sis for those claims.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, In­done­sia should be able to take steps to im­ple­ment and ex­er­cise its ba­sic for­eign pol­icy method­ol­ogy of “nav­i­gat­ing be­tween two rocks”, in this case be­tween two of its friends, namely China and the United States (as well as its “al­lies”, the Quad), all of whom are also In­done­sian friends.</p>
    <p>It would be also im­por­tant for In­done­sia to use the im­ple­men­ta­tion of its doc­trine of Asean cen­tral­ity in this is­sue, pri­mar­ily be­cause Asean coun­tries are “sand­wiched” in this quar­rel, par­tic­u­larly be­tween China and the US and some of its friends that are in­volved in this case.</p>
    <p>Edi­to­rial</p>
    <p>Philip­pine Daily In­quirer The Philip­pines</p>
    <p>De­fence Sec­re­tary Delfin Loren­zana blasted China for its out­ra­geous claim that the Philip­pines had been con­duct­ing “il­le­gal provoca­tive ac­tiv­i­ties” in the West Philip­pine Sea.</p>
    <p>In a statement, Mr Loren­zana hit out at the con­tention of Chi­nese for­eign min­istry spokesman Zhao Li­jian that the Philip­pines had in­fringed on China’s sovereignt­y and se­cu­rity when it sent mil­i­tary air­craft to Panatag (Scar­bor­ough) Shoal, and that the Philip­pines should “im­me­di­ately stop il­le­gal provo­ca­tions”.</p>
    <p>“Il­le­gal provo­ca­tions? That area is within our EEZ (exclusive eco­nomic zone). Their (China’s) so-called his­tor­i­cal rights over an area en­closed by their nine-dash line doesn’t ex­ist ex­cept in their imag­i­na­tions,” said Mr Loren­zana.</p>
    <p>Mr Zhao was re­act­ing to the diplo­matic protest filed two weeks ago by the Depart­ment of For­eign Af­fairs over China’s il­le­gal con­fis­ca­tion back in May of Filipino fish­er­men’s equip­ment in Scar­bor­ough Shoal.</p>
    <p>China seized Scar­bor­ough from the Philip­pines in 2012 fol­low­ing a tense stand-off, which then led to the fil­ing of a case at the Per­ma­nent Court of Ar­bi­tra­tion in The Hague.</p>
    <p>In 2016, the Philip­pines won the ar­bi­tra­tion award, which in­val­i­dated China’s claims of his­tor­i­cal own­er­ship over much of the South China Sea and up­held the Philip­pines’ ter­ri­to­rial claims.</p>
    <p>How­ever, ev­i­dently subscribin­g to the dic­tum that a lie re­peated of­ten enough be­comes the truth, China has re­jected the rul­ing and con­tin­ues to in­sist on its so-called nine-dash-line claim to the re­gion, which no coun­try in the world recog­nises.</p>
    <p>Edi­to­rial</p>
    <p>The Yomi­uri Shim­bun, Ja­pan</p>
    <p>There is a growing sense of cau­tion in the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity about China’s for­eign loans.</p>
    <p>Loans from the Asian In­fra­struc­ture In­vest­ment Bank (AIIB), which is a China-led in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tion es­tab­lished with much fan­fare, have been slug­gish, ap­par­ently due to scep­ti­cism that they could be used as a tool for China’s hege­mony.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese govern­ment should make ef­forts to dis­pel the in­ter­na­tional con­cerns.</p>
    <p>Since its open­ing in 2016, the</p>
    <p>AIIB has ap­proved 87 loans to­talling about US$20 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$27 bil­lion).</p>
    <p>The fig­ure is a lot less than the ini­tial es­ti­mate, and falls far short of the per­for­mance of the Asian</p>
    <p>De­vel­op­ment Bank backed mainly by the United States and Ja­pan.</p>
    <p>In Asia, there is strong de­mand for funds for in­fra­struc­ture de­vel­op­ment. The AIIB’s loans have not in­creased de­spite ro­bust de­mand, prob­a­bly be­cause of the bank’s poor man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>The AIIB has a small num­ber of staff. It does not per­ma­nently sta­tion mem­bers of the board of di­rec­tors who are se­lected from ma­jor coun­tries at its head­quar­ters in Bei­jing, and the board’s sur­veil­lance and gov­er­nance sys­tem is in­suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>China is in con­flict with In­dia, its largest lend­ing part­ner, over a border that has yet to be de­mar­cated.</p>
    <p>It tight­ened its crack­down on Hong Kong and im­posed high tar­iffs on some im­ports from Aus­tralia, which crit­i­cised the coun­try’s re­sponse to the novel coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>This hard-line diplo­matic stance seems to have had a neg­a­tive im­pact on the AIIB’s loans.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, it is wor­ri­some that China is ex­pand­ing its bi­lat­eral ex­ter­nal loans to mainly African coun­tries.</p>
    <p>As at the end of 2018, China had loaned about US$100 bil­lion to nearly 60 de­vel­op­ing coun­tries. This fig­ure is com­pa­ra­ble to that of the World Bank.</p>
    <p>The loans have been crit­i­cised as “debt traps” that earn eco­nomic and se­cu­rity ben­e­fits by bur­den­ing de­vel­op­ing coun­tries with debts.</p>
    <p>Sri Lanka granted China the right to use a port for 99 years in re­turn for its in­abil­ity to re­pay a debt.</p>
    <p>The in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity needs to make ef­forts to grasp the sit­u­a­tion and urge China to ex­tend loans that will lead to the sound de­vel­op­ment of de­vel­op­ing coun­tries.</p>
