    <p>The un­em­ploy­ment rate for Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents dipped slightly last Novem­ber com­pared with the pre­vi­ous month, the first drop in 2020, fig­ures from the Min­istry of Man­power showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The monthly res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate for Novem­ber was 4.6 per cent, an im­prove­ment from 4.8 per cent in Oc­to­ber. The rate among ci­ti­zens also im­proved slightly, from 4.9 per cent in Oc­to­ber to 4.7 per cent in Novem­ber.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the un­em­ploy­ment rate was 3.3 per cent in Novem­ber, com­pared with 3.6 per cent the pre­vi­ous month.</p>
    <p>Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo, who was vis­it­ing the Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute (e2i) in Jurong East yes­ter­day, said that while the fig­ures are a re­lief, it is still too early to say whether the job mar­ket is out of the woods. She cau­tioned against look­ing at the sit­u­a­tion through a sin­gle statis­tic.</p>
    <p>“Those who fol­low the jobs sit­u­a­tion re­ports will know that I have al­ways cau­tioned about the need to look at labour mar­ket sta­tis­tics holis­ti­cally. Un­em­ploy­ment rate is only one di­men­sion. We should also look at em­ploy­ment lev­els to know if our work­force par­tic­i­pa­tion has ex­panded or con­tracted,” she said.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo added that the re­lease of em­ploy­ment, un­em­ploy­ment and re­dun­dancy fig­ures for the fourth quar­ter of last year later this month will bring a fuller pic­ture of the labour mar­ket sit­u­a­tion.</p>
    <p>She said the Gov­ern­ment will re­main cau­tious, as re­cov­ery of the labour mar­ket is ex­pected to be bumpy, un­like pre­vi­ous crises, and the pan­demic con­tin­ues to rage, with a resur­gence in some coun­tries and the emer­gence of a new strain.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic is also ex­pected to have long-last­ing ef­fects on busi­nesses, putting pres­sure on work­ers to con­tinue to up­grade their skills, she said.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo also thanked tri­par­tite part­ners Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the Sin­ga­pore Na­tional Em­ploy­ers Fed­er­a­tion for their ef­forts in main­tain­ing a strong pro­por­tion of lo­cals in the work­force.</p>
    <p>NTUC sec­re­tary-gen­eral Ng Chee Meng, who was also at e2i, said the 10,000 em­ploy­ers who are part of the NTUC Job Se­cu­rity Council played an im­por­tant role in job­match­ing ef­forts. “Up to now, we have se­cured 28,000 suc­cess­ful job matches across all in­dus­tries.”</p>
    <p>“While this is just a num­ber, im­por­tantly, be­hind all these are the men and women in NTUC, in e2i, do­ing all the dif­fer­ent work in job sup­port, in job match­ing and... job train­ing as well,” he added.</p>
    <p>“All the ecosys­tems that we have built up in these nine months are due to the very ded­i­cated, hard work of union lead­ers on the ground, staff at NTUC, our gov­ern­ment col­leagues and em­ploy­ers that are will­ing to step for­ward.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ng said NTUC will con­tinue to sup­port work­ers to face labour chal­lenges this year.</p>
    <p>Com­ment­ing on the lat­est fig­ures, OCBC Bank’s chief economist Se­lena Ling said the labour mar­ket is be­gin­ning to sta­bilise. “This could po­ten­tially sig­nify that the un­em­ploy­ment rate peaked in Oc­to­ber and should grad­u­ally start to ease in the com­ing months,” said Ms Ling, who is head of trea­sury re­search and strat­egy at OCBC Bank.</p>
    <p>But she added that the rate will likely re­main el­e­vated this year with dig­i­tal dis­rup­tion, and the re­open­ing of bor­ders ex­pected to take some time.</p>
