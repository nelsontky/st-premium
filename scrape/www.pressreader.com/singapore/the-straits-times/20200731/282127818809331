    <p>HONG KONG • There is con­cern among Hong Kong’s com­mer­cial len­ders as build­ing val­ues fell 30 per cent in the past 12 months, and they may call in or re­struc­ture loans if val­ues fall fur­ther.</p>
    <p>If len­ders de­mand re­pay­ment of loans or try to tighten terms, it could set off a wave of prop­erty sales that might de­press prices even fur­ther in the Chi­nese-run ter­ri­tory, which is al­ready stuck in a re­ces­sion due to the US-China trade spat, vi­o­lent street protests last year and the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>“The mar­ket is not go­ing to get bet­ter in the next half to one year,” said a real es­tate in­vestor who pro­vides fi­nanc­ing i n the city. “If you’re in the Hong Kong mar­ket, I’d say de-risk if you can. Get your money back.”</p>
    <p>Banks and non-bank len­ders – the bro­kers and in­vest­ment firms that make up the un­reg­u­lated “shadow bank” sec­tor – have lent bil­lions of dol­lars over the past few years in the world’s most valu­able real es­tate mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Len­ders and bor­row­ers were happy when prices were ris­ing, but there is now con­cern as val­ues de­cline. Mez­za­nine in­vestors, firms which lend money in shorter time frames and at higher in­ter­est rates, are seen as most at risk.</p>
    <p>Un­der Hong Kong Mone­tary Author­ity rules, banks can­not lend more than 40 per cent of the as­set value to com­mer­cial prop­erty buy­ers in or­der to min­imise the dam­age caused by de­faults. Mez­za­nine in­vestors and other shadow banks are not bound by that.</p>
    <p>“There are mez­za­nine in­vestors that are overly ag­gres­sive in pro­vid­ing ex­cep­tion­ally high loan-to­value (LTV) at circa 80 per cent against un­der­ly­ing as­sets’ true value,” said Mr Ryan Chung, man­ag­ing di­rec­tor at Hu­atai In­ter­na­tional, a ma­jor mez­za­nine in­vestor.</p>
    <p>“Given of­fice rental has re­treated roughly 10 per cent in the first half (of this year) and oc­cu­pancy rate is on the soft side, it def­i­nitely im­pacts the as­set valu­a­tion and po­ten­tially trig­gers fi­nan­cial covenants,” said Mr Chung, re­fer­ring to the con­di­tions of loans.</p>
    <p>He said some len­ders are now de­mand­ing new prop­erty val­u­a­tions in or­der to check that the lat­est value does not breach the LTV limit set out in the covenant.</p>
    <p>Re­cently, mez­za­nine in­vestors de­manded that Goldin Fi­nan­cial re­pay about HK$3.5 bil­lion (S$621 mil­lion) on a loan fa­cil­ity pledged to an of­fice tower in a sec­ond-tier east­ern Kowloon busi­ness dis­trict.</p>
    <p>Goldin sold a res­i­den­tial plot this week for HK$3.5 bil­lion in or­der to re­pay the debt, tak­ing a HK$2.75 bil­lion loss on its orig­i­nal in­vest­ment. The cred­i­tors took pos­ses­sion of the 27-storey prop­erty.</p>
    <p>Goldin bought the tower in 2018 from its chair­man for HK$17 bil­lion, mak­ing the to­tal LTV ra­tio 60 per cent. Goldin said this month the prop­erty had a mar­ket value of be­tween HK$15 bil­lion and HK$16.5 bil­lion, but some valuers and cred­i­tors told Reuters that even a valu­a­tion of HK$15 bil­lion – which would put the LTV ra­tio at 68 per cent – was too high.</p>
    <p>Fall­ing val­u­a­tions are wor­ry­ing banks, which are dis­cussing the gap be­tween “eco­nomic re­al­i­ties and mar­ket val­u­a­tions”, one ex­ec­u­tive at a ma­jor for­eign bank with sig­nif­i­cant mort­gage busi­ness in Hong Kong told Reuters.</p>
    <p>De­faults have al­ready hap­pened, said the fi­nanc­ing in­vestor who pre­dicted no im­prove­ment in the mar­ket, but banks are not dis­clos­ing them.</p>
