    <p>Three women, aged be­tween 32 and 55, were ar­rested fol­low­ing a scuf­fle near Block 13 Ma­rine Ter­race in Ma­rine Pa­rade on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>Two fe­male teenagers, aged 14 and 15, and a 38-year-old man are also be­ing in­ves­ti­gated, po­lice said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Po­lice said they were called to the scene at about 1.45pm on Tues­day. Two of­fi­cers ar­rived and found two groups of peo­ple, in­volv­ing a to­tal of 11 peo­ple, in a heated dis­pute.</p>
    <p>“Mem­bers of one group were seen ap­proach­ing the other group in an ag­gres­sive man­ner and one of­fi­cer took a mem­ber of the first group aside to en­gage sep­a­rately. The other of­fi­cer at­tempted to calm and sep­a­rate the rest.</p>
    <p>“Some mem­bers of both groups sub­se­quently broke into a scuf­fle, de­spite re­peated ad­vice and in­ter­ven­tion by the of­fi­cer. Both of­fi­cers suc­cess­fully broke up the scuf­fle shortly,” said po­lice.</p>
    <p>Six other of­fi­cers ar­rived within min­utes to pro­vide as­sis­tance.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions found that the t wo fe­male teenagers knew each other and the other nine peo­ple were their fam­ily mem­bers and a friend. The dis­pute ini­tially arose due to of­fen­sive re­marks ex­changed be­tween mem­bers of both groups on Mon­day, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>In­ves­ti­ga­tions are con­tin­u­ing. On Thurs­day, a video of the scuf­fle was up­loaded onto al­ter­na­tive me­dia All Sin­ga­pore Stuff’s Face­book page.</p>
    <p>If con­victed of af­fray, the three women could each be jailed for up to a year, fined $5,000, or both.</p>
    <p>The po­lice re­it­er­ate that they do not con­done acts of vi­o­lence. Mem­bers of the public have also been ad­vised to fol­low the in­struc­tions of po­lice of­fi­cers and not take the law into their own hands.</p>
    <p>Pre­lim­i­nary in­ves­ti­ga­tions found that the two fe­male teenagers knew each other and the other nine peo­ple were their fam­ily mem­bers and a friend. The dis­pute ini­tially arose due to of­fen­sive re­marks ex­changed be­tween mem­bers of both groups on Mon­day, po­lice said.</p>
