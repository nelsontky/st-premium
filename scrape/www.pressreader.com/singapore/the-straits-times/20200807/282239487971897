    <p>SAN FRAN­CISCO • Rory McIl­roy is hop­ing the first Ma­jor of the year, the PGA Cham­pi­onship, can spark his game and get him back to the form that saw him reach the world No. 1 rank­ing ear­lier this year for an eighth time.</p>
    <p>The four-time Ma­jor win­ner got off to a rous­ing start this sea­son with a string of top-10 fin­ishes, but then the coro­n­avirus pandemic hit, prompt­ing a three-month hia­tus for the PGA Tour.</p>
    <p>“Be­fore the world sort of shut down, I was play­ing some re­ally good golf,” he said. “Hav­ing that break, and then com­ing back ev­ery­thing sort of changed. Ev­ery­thing feels dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>McIl­roy has al­ready won two PGA Cham­pi­onships, and while his last one in 2014 also ac­counts for his most re­cent Ma­jor, he has won at TPC Hard­ing Park be­fore.</p>
    <p>“It’s the first Ma­jor in over a year, and it would be a great week to get back into some form and give it a good run,” the North­ern Ir­ish­man, who clinched the 2015 WGC-Cadil­lac Match­play event here, said ahead of his open­ing round, in a group com­pris­ing Amer­i­can duo Tiger Woods and Justin Thomas.</p>
    <p>Fans will not be present as they have been barred for the re­main­der of the sea­son ow­ing to the pandemic, so in­stead of feed­ing off the gallery, McIl­roy’s point of ref­er­ence will be the leader­board.</p>
    <p>“There’s no feed­back from any­where else,” he said. “There’s even no score­board hold­ers, so you don’t know how the guys in your group are do­ing. It’s go­ing to be like this for the fore­see­able fu­ture.”</p>
    <p>McIl­roy is one of sev­eral play­ers who have held the world No. 1 rank­ing at some point this sea­son, in­clud­ing Spain’s Jon Rahm, English­man Justin Rose and cur­rent topranked golfer Thomas.</p>
    <p>They will all be in the frame, but the 31-year-old McIl­roy knows if he can get his short game in or­der, he will be a threat to win his third PGA Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>Al­though McIl­roy is not com­ing into form – he has not had a top-10 fin­ish in five starts since the Tour’s restart in June – he feels it is a mat­ter of mi­nor ad­just­ments as he bids to end his six-year Ma­jor drought.</p>
    <p>“My game doesn’t feel that far away... It’s just the sharp­ness and be­ing ef­fi­cient with my scor­ing. Turn­ing the 73s that I’ve shot into 70s,” he said.</p>
    <p>“When I play these Ma­jor cham­pi­onships, it’s (the win­less streak) some­thing that I’m ob­vi­ously re­minded of.”</p>
    <p>That lin­ger­ing sense of un­der­achieve­ment is also what drives Thomas as he bids to earn just his sec­ond Ma­jor suc­cess af­ter the 2017 PGA Cham­pi­onship.</p>
    <p>Last Sun­day, the 27-year-old won the WGC-St Jude In­vi­ta­tional to be­come the third-youngest player to rack up 13 Tour vic­to­ries, be­hind only Woods and Jack Nick­laus. But his Ma­jor record is nowhere as stel­lar, with only one other top-10 fin­ish at the 2017 US Open.</p>
    <p>Be­com­ing world No. 1 for the sec­ond time in his ca­reer has, how­ever, boosted his be­lief.</p>
    <p>“I’ve got my­self to the point now where I do have it (the top rank­ing) back, which is an awe­some feel­ing. But it’s not like I’m out here play­ing this week to... try and grow my lead. I’m out here for one rea­son, it’s just to try to win a golf tour­na­ment.”</p>
    <p>RE­VIVAL HOPE</p>
    <p>Be­fore the world sort of shut down, I was play­ing some re­ally good golf. Hav­ing that break, and then com­ing back ev­ery­thing sort of changed. Ev­ery­thing feels dif­fer­ent.</p>
    <p>’’</p>
