    <p>Well be­fore the pan­demic hit, the Pil­lai fam­ily were al­ready ex­perts in hy­giene and so­cial dis­tanc­ing.</p>
    <p>They did not have a choice. Their youngest child, Lash­wyn Nis­han, was born at 24 weeks old in Jan­uary 2018 at 677g af­ter an emer­gency Csec­tion that also threat­ened the life of his mother, Ms Tu­nitha Reku.</p>
    <p>Ms Reku, 40, an as­sis­tant teacher at a spe­cial-needs school, re­calls that the nurses told her Lash­wyn ap­peared life­less af­ter de­liv­ery, while she lost con­scious­ness af­ter mas­sive in­ter­nal bleed­ing. “But when they brought me back, he started cry­ing,” she says.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing his frag­ile im­mune sys­tem safe was a pri­or­ity when his par­ents took him home af­ter about five months in the neona­tal in­ten­sive care unit at the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal (NUH).</p>
    <p>Be­sides stock­ing up on hand sani­tis­ers and bar­ring ex­tended fam­ily from vis­it­ing, Mr Nis­han Pil­lai, 41, a fi­nance and op­er­a­tions man­ager, and Ms Reku both went for flu jabs and checks for chick­en­pox.</p>
    <p>So did their three other kids, now aged nine to 11, and both sets of grand­par­ents. Their helper was not al­lowed to han­dle the baby in the be­gin­ning too.</p>
    <p>Lash­wyn’s first year at home was a whirl­wind of med­i­cal fol­low-ups, surgery for her­nia and a con­stant bat­tle against com­mon vi­ral in­fec­tions. Be­cause of his lung is­sues, a com­mon cold would es­ca­late quickly into a cough, fol­lowed by breath­less episodes that some­times re­quired emer­gency vis­its to the hos­pi­tal.</p>
    <p>In­stead of the cus­tom­ary first­month cel­e­bra­tion, ex­tended rel­a­tives met the tod­dler only last year when he was about one year old.</p>
    <p>As Lash­wyn’s health im­proved, the Pil­lais en­rolled him in a child­care cen­tre nearby in March, only to pull him out quickly be­cause of the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>He grad­u­ally re­sumed les­sons in June and “loves school”, his mother says of her chatty lit­tle one, who made friends with this re­porter and the pho­tog­ra­pher dur­ing the in­ter­view.</p>
    <p>“He’s got a spe­cial place in ev­ery­one’s heart. He’s the small­est at the child­care cen­tre. Even the K1 and K2 chil­dren want to play with him.”</p>
    <p>Just as things were look­ing up, Lash­wyn had a seizure last month dur­ing a vi­ral fever. Thank­fully, he was with a doc­tor at the ac­ci­dent and emer­gency depart­ment when it hap­pened, and was ad­mit­ted for two nights.</p>
    <p>“That’s when all the emo­tions came back – the wor­ries, why he had to go through this again,” says Mr Pil­lai.</p>
    <p>That episode had a sil­ver lin­ing, how­ever, when Ms Reku dis­cov­ered that her son could use a fork and feed him­self in­de­pen­dently.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t know whether to be up­set that he’s in the hos­pi­tal or be su­per proud that he’s eat­ing the noo­dles by him­self,” she says.</p>
    <p>The Pil­lais are grate­ful that Lash­wyn has ral­lied the en­tire fam­ily to­gether. His el­der sis­ter Lashell, 11, who dotes on him, loves “how much grit he has and how cute he is”.</p>
    <p>Hav­ing him has also re­framed the par­ent­ing pa­ram­e­ters for Ms Reku and her hus­band.</p>
    <p>“As long as he’s bet­ter than the day be­fore, it’s an achieve­ment to me,” she says.</p>
