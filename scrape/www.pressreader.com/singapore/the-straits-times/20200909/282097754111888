    <p>Ms Hany Soh, an MP for Mar­sil­ing-Yew Tee GRC, sug­gested that a 15-minute park­ing grace pe­riod be pro­vided for food de­liv­ery rid­ers and that malls have des­ig­nated food de­liv­ery pickup points (New MPs Speak, Sept 5).</p>
    <p>There are prob­a­bly thou­sands of peo­ple em­ployed by food de­liv­ery plat­forms Food­panda, Grab and De­liv­eroo.</p>
    <p>I once had a con­ver­sa­tion with a Grab food de­liv­ery rider at an In­dian Mus­lim restau­rant as he waited to pick up an or­der. I asked him how much he made in a month and he said about $3,000.</p>
    <p>He added that he started his 10-hour shift from as early as 6am and that it was a very rushed and tir­ing job. Re­gard­less of rain or shine, he was con­stantly on the move, he said.</p>
    <p>While talk­ing to me, he no­ticed a park­ing war­den stand­ing be­side his mo­tor­cy­cle parked out­side the restau­rant.</p>
    <p>He im­me­di­ately rushed out and pleaded with the war­den to over­look his in­dis­cre­tion. I also weighed in on his be­half and he was let off even­tu­ally.</p>
    <p>If a vi­o­la­tion ticket is is­sued to such rid­ers, it trans­lates to at least one day of earn­ings.</p>
    <p>Per­haps the Land Trans­port Author­ity should se­ri­ously con­sider Ms Soh’s pro­posal.</p>
