    <p>•</p>
    <p>Mil­i­tants linked to the Is­lamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) have mur­dered four peo­ple in a re­mote Chris­tian com­mu­nity on the In­done­sian is­land of Su­lawesi, the au­thor­i­ties said yes­ter­day, with one vic­tim be­headed and an­other burned to death.</p>
    <p>The group of sword-and-gun-wield­ing at­tack­ers am­bushed Lem­ban­ton­goa vil­lage in Cen­tral Su­lawesi prov­ince on Fri­day morn­ing, killing sev­eral res­i­dents and torch­ing half a dozen homes, in­clud­ing one used for reg­u­lar prayers and ser­vices, po­lice said.</p>
    <p>No ar­rests have yet been made and the mo­tive for the at­tack is not im­me­di­ately clear.</p>
    <p>But the au­thor­i­ties pointed the fin­ger at the Su­lawesi-based East In­done­sia Mu­jahideen (MIT), one of dozens of rad­i­cal groups across the sprawl­ing South-east Asian ar­chi­pel­ago that have pledged al­le­giance to ISIS. In­done­sia, the world’s big­gest Mus­lim­ma­jor­ity coun­try, has long wres­tled with Is­lamist mil­i­tancy and ter­ror at­tacks, while Cen­tral Su­lawesi has seen in­ter­mit­tent vi­o­lence be­tween Chris­tians and Mus­lims for decades.</p>
    <p>“We reached the con­clu­sion that they (the at­tack­ers) were from MIT after show­ing pic­tures of its mem­bers to rel­a­tives of the vic­tims,” said Sigi re­gency po­lice chief Yoga Priyahutam­a. The makeshift church was empty at the time of the early morn­ing at­tack by around eight mil­i­tants, he added. “Peo­ple were just in their homes when it hap­pened,” Mr Yoga said.</p>
    <p>Lem­ban­ton­goa vil­lage head Ri­fai said one vic­tim was be­headed and an­other was nearly de­cap­i­tated. One of the other all-male vic­tims was stabbed while a fourth was burned to death in his home.</p>
    <p>If con­firmed to be the work of MIT, Fri­day’s killings would be its first sig­nif­i­cant at­tack since the or­gan­i­sa­tion’s leader was killed four years ago by In­done­sia’s elite anti-ter­ror squad, ac­cord­ing to Jakarta-based ter­ror­ism ex­pert Sid­ney Jones.</p>
