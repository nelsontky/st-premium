    <p>Hong Kong singer Sammi Cheng has a strong so­cial me­dia game, but fans sus­pected some­thing was amiss when there were no post­ings from her for about two months.</p>
    <p>The Can­topop queen’s last post was on Oct 26, about ac­tor Louis Koo’s 50th birth­day cel­e­bra­tion.</p>
    <p>She re­turned to so­cial me­dia on Sun­day, post­ing a photo taken with her father and re­veal­ing he died last month.</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old singer wrote that she and her sib­lings were pre­par­ing for their father’s fu­neral last month.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing this pe­riod, be­sides pre­par­ing qui­etly for my father’s fu­neral, I was ad­just­ing my mind,” she wrote in Chi­nese. “My sib­lings and I are also tak­ing care of my mother (who has lost her part­ner of many years).”</p>
    <p>Cheng re­vealed in Oc­to­ber that her father, who was in his 80s, was hos­pi­talised for more than 10 days.</p>
    <p>She and her sib­lings took turns to care for him.</p>
    <p>She also re­vealed in early Oc­to­ber t he death of Lucky, her 15-year-old pet dog.</p>
    <p>“I have ex­pe­ri­enced con­tin­u­ous pain af­ter first los­ing Lucky and then my dad,” Cheng wrote.</p>
    <p>“My tears fall un­con­trol­lably oc­ca­sion­ally when I think of them. We are mor­tals af­ter all and some­times have to al­low our­selves to be strong and vul­ner­a­ble at the same time.”</p>
    <p>Cheng ap­peared to have re­cov­ered from her sor­row the next day when she wrote three posts on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The fit­ness buff wrote in one of the posts that her fit­ness reg­i­men has re­mained un­changed in the last two months as she be­lieves that ex­er­cise and sweat­ing ward off neg­a­tive en­ergy.</p>
    <p>As usual, there was no men­tion of her hus­band, singer Andy Hui.</p>
    <p>Hui, 53, who was caught in a cheating scan­dal with ac­tress Jac­que­line Wong in April last year, has not posted on so­cial me­dia since his last post on Lucky on Oct 7.</p>
