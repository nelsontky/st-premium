    <p>Many Sin­ga­pore­ans study­ing in Bri­tain are choos­ing to hun­ker down and wait it out de­spite a new wave of Covid-19 sweep­ing through the coun­try, in­clud­ing in more than 30 uni­ver­si­ties, with few con­sid­er­ing re­turn­ing home.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to Bri­tish me­dia, thou­sands of stu­dents have been in self­iso­la­tion since the new school term started last month, and at least 33 uni­ver­si­ties were re­ported to have con­firmed cases of Covid-19 amid a sec­ond wave in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>They in­clude Aberdeen Univer­sity, Durham Univer­sity, Manch­ester Metropoli­tan Univer­sity and the Univer­sity of Glas­gow.</p>
    <p>Ms Teresa Yong, 22, a third-year stu­dent at the Univer­sity of Manch­ester, which is just 500m away from Manch­ester Metropoli­tan Univer­sity, said the news makes her “a lit­tle wor­ried about at­tend­ing in­per­son classes now”.</p>
    <p>“But in terms of long-term con­sid­er­a­tions, I’m not that wor­ried be­cause my univer­sity is quite pre­pared to move ev­ery­thing on­line as well as take strong ac­tion against any­one who vi­o­lates so­cial dis­tanc­ing rules in school com­pounds,” said Ms Yong, who is read­ing so­cial an­thro­pol­ogy. She re­turned to Manch­ester in late Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Last month, Bri­tish Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock said that univer­sity stu­dents might have to re­main on cam­pus over the Christ­mas break to re­duce the spread of the coro­n­avirus, if there were wide­spread is­sues with out­breaks on cam­puses.</p>
    <p>Ms Yong said that de­spite this, she is still choos­ing to re­main in Manch­ester. “The plan is to stay, un­less stu­dents are asked to evac­u­ate the coun­try.”</p>
    <p>She and most of her Sin­ga­porean friends “had not planned to head back dur­ing Christ­mas in the first place due to the un­cer­tain­ties of fly­ing and hav­ing to quar­an­tine back in Sin­ga­pore”, she added.</p>
    <p>Trav­ellers from Sin­ga­pore were added to the UK’s travel cor­ri­dor list last month, and they do not have to en­ter quar­an­tine if they have not been in or tran­sited through any other non-ex­empt coun­tries in the 14 days pre­ced­ing their ar­rival.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond-year med­i­cal stu­dent Wong E-Shuen, who is back at the Univer­sity of Aberdeen, said she is sup­posed to at­tend a num­ber of clin­i­cal ses­sions on cam­pus, as well as ward place­ments, which the univer­sity would pro­vide more in­for­ma­tion on in time. “But we’ll be wear­ing per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment dur­ing these ses­sions, so I’m not wor­ried,” said the 20-year-old.</p>
    <p>Most lec­tures and tu­to­ri­als are be­ing car­ried out on­line, while meet­ings with pa­tient-part­ners for med­i­cal stu­dents are also car­ried out via phone calls and vir­tu­ally, she added.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said she has no plans to go home yet though “the cases do seem to be in­creas­ing”.</p>
    <p>“I was well aware of the sit­u­a­tion be­fore I came over,” she said.</p>
    <p>She has been plan­ning her study sched­ule for on­line lec­tures and tu­to­ri­als, cook­ing her meals in her apartment and us­ing home de­liv­ery for gro­ceries and other ne­ces­si­ties to avoid go­ing into shops too of­ten.</p>
    <p>Univer­sity of Glas­gow stu­dent Ng Wei­han re­turned to Sin­ga­pore in March.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond-year stu­dent has not made plans to travel back to Glas­gow as she “feels it is not quite safe to re­turn as of now”.</p>
    <p>Ms Ng, 19, who is read­ing com­put­ing sci­ence and mu­sic, said she is glad to have avoided the wave of in­fec­tions in her school and has heard of some of her school­mates hav­ing to self-iso­late.</p>
    <p>But she said that re­mote learning has its chal­lenges, adding that it is eas­ier to han­dle her com­put­ing sciences classes on­line, though her mu­sic mod­ules can be chal­leng­ing.</p>
    <p>“On­line learning is tough, es­pe­cially with the time dif­fer­ence, but I am cop­ing well.”</p>
