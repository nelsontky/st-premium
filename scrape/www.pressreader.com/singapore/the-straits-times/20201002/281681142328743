    <p>Trou­bled fi­nan­cial ser­vices provider Wire­card pulled the plug on its ser­vices yes­ter­day, leav­ing lo­cal busi­nesses scram­bling to switch pay­ments providers.</p>
    <p>The Mone­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) had ear­lier di­rected the Ger­man pay­ments firm to stop its pay­ment ser­vices and re­turn all cus­tomers’ funds by Oct 14.</p>
    <p>MAS told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that Wire­card has in­formed the author­ity that it has ceased pro­vid­ing pay­ment pro­cess­ing ser­vices to cus­tomers and that it is as­sist­ing them on al­ter­na­tive providers.</p>
    <p>Some re­tail­ers said it has been tough find­ing al­ter­na­tive e-pay­ments com­pa­nies that of­fer com­pet­i­tive rates.</p>
    <p>Ms Ariel Lee, di­rec­tor of food and bev­er­age (F&B) firm Sun­park Sin­ga­pore, which runs brands such as Tonkotsu Kazan Ra­men and BelleVille pan­cake cafe, said: “We didn’t switch ear­lier be­cause there was no con­crete news that (Wire­card) can’t pro­vide ser­vices, and they were pay­ing us on time.”</p>
    <p>Credit card trans­ac­tions be­gan be­ing re­jected by the sys­tem at the group’s out­lets just af­ter noon yes­ter­day. While it has other pay­ment op­tions, credit cards make up 20 per cent of its to­tal trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Ms Lee added: “The new quotes I got from other firms are at least 0.5 to 1 per­cent­age point higher, which trans­lates to pretty high fees in the long run. Some com­pa­nies also want to charge ter­mi­nal fees for the phys­i­cal scan­ner.”</p>
    <p>The So­cial Al­ley restau­rant in Hol­land Vil­lage has used a bank as its mer­chant ac­qui­si­tion ser­vice provider since it opened this year.</p>
    <p>A mer­chant ac­quirer helps busi­nesses process debit or credit card pay­ments for their cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Mr James Tay, chief ex­ec­u­tive of J Cap­i­tal Plus, which owns the out­let un­der its F&B arm, said: “We wanted to use Wire­card but held back be­cause of the re­cent de­vel­op­ments in the news.”</p>
    <p>He added that the bank’s fees are higher by about 0.2 to 0.3 per­cent­age point, which adds up sub­stan­tially over time. “We chose to put up with this be­cause we did not want to deal with the has­sle of chang­ing op­er­a­tors mid­way.”</p>
    <p>Wire­card said yes­ter­day that it re­grets the MAS de­ci­sion, adding: “We would like to as­sure all our cus­tomers that we will work with MAS to min­imise dis­rup­tion to pay­ment ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“Our teams, in­clud­ing call cen­tre and re­la­tion­ship man­agers, are here to sup­port, should any of our mer­chants re­quire as­sis­tance or have fur­ther ques­tions.”</p>
    <p>Wire­card’s main busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties here in­volve pro­cess­ing Visa and Mastercard pay­ments for mer­chants and help­ing com­pa­nies to is­sue pre-paid cards. It also pro­vides ser­vices for card is­suers, but does not is­sue pre-paid cards di­rectly to con­sumers here.</p>
    <p>Mastercard and Visa did not re­ply to The Straits Times’ queries by press time.</p>
    <p>Wire­card’s ma­jor clients here in­clude taxi firm Com­fortDelGro.</p>
    <p>Ms Tammy Tan, Com­fortDelGro’s chief cor­po­rate com­mu­ni­ca­tions of­fi­cer, said the com­pany is work­ing with sev­eral al­ter­na­tive providers to min­imise im­pact to its cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for NTUC In­come said its di­rect ar­range­ments with Wire­card ceased in Au­gust.</p>
    <p>Al­ter­na­tive forms of e-pay­ment in­clude Nets, PayNow and SGQR.</p>
    <p>Banks said they have been help­ing mer­chants to switch pay­ment ser­vice providers in the last few months, but added that the process usu­ally takes some time.</p>
    <p>United Over­seas Bank (UOB) has seen an 80 per cent to 90 per cent in­crease in the num­ber of mer­chants in­quir­ing about its ac­quir­ing busi­ness in the last two to three months.</p>
    <p>Ms Jac­que­lyn Tan, head of its group per­sonal fi­nan­cial ser­vices, said: “We un­der­stand that it is im­por­tant to as­sist the tran­si­tion of busi­nesses and to present them with the op­tions avail­able so they en­sure the con­ti­nu­ity of their busi­ness.”</p>
    <p>UOB has been in the mer­chant ac­quir­ing busi­ness for three decades and sup­ports about a third of firms here, it said.</p>
    <p>Ms Tan said the process of switch­ing ac­quir­ers can take a cou­ple of days to a month, de­pend­ing on the firm’s busi­ness model.</p>
    <p>Fac­tors that can in­flu­ence the tran­si­tion time in­clude whether the busi­ness is a chain or a sin­gle out­let, if it al­lows for mul­ti­ple cur­ren­cies and how many touch points it has.</p>
    <p>E-com­merce firms might also take longer be­cause of tech­ni­cal re­quire­ments, com­pared with phys­i­cal op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank said that it also has been help­ing mer­chants make the tran­si­tion for sev­eral months.</p>
    <p>OCBC Bank’s head of cards busi­ness Vin­cent Tan noted that the bank has been get­ting queries since July from mer­chants who were look­ing to switch from Wire­card.</p>
    <p>“We have since on-boarded sev­eral new mer­chants from the re­tail, F&B and even ed­u­ca­tion in­dus­tries,” he said.</p>
    <p>It also re­ceived more queries yes­ter­day morn­ing from mer­chants af­fected by the news.</p>
    <p>“The usual on-board­ing process takes place within seven days, and we have al­ready stepped up man­power to deal with the higher amount of re­quests dur­ing this pe­riod,” he said.</p>
    <p>“This is to en­sure that all our mer­chants will be able to re­sume usual pay­ment op­er­a­tions as soon as pos­si­ble and as fuss-free as pos­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Five fur­ther charges were lodged against a Sin­ga­porean man in re­la­tion to Wire­card.</p>
    <p>R. Shan­mu­garat­nam, a di­rec­tor of Ci­tadelle Cor­po­rate Ser­vices, had al­legedly faked five more let­ters in early 2017 stat­ing bo­gus bal­ances held in his com­pany’s ac­counts.</p>
    <p>The po­lice said it could not com­ment on on­go­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tions, in re­sponse to The Straits Times’ queries on the probe into firms linked to Wire­card.</p>
