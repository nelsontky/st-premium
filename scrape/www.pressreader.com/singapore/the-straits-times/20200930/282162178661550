    <p>A new cen­tre that aims to boost re­gional col­lab­o­ra­tion so as to pre­pare Asean for the chang­ing na­ture of work was launched yesterday.</p>
    <p>The Re­gional Cen­tre for the Fu­ture of Work will bring to­gether in­ter­na­tional ex­perts and re­gional tri­par­tite stake­hold­ers to foster so­cial di­a­logue, share knowl­edge and build ca­pa­bil­i­ties, said Man­power Min­is­ter Josephine Teo, an­nounc­ing the launch at a vir­tual con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>This comes as Covid-19 causes up­heaval in labour mar­kets world­wide.</p>
    <p>Mrs Teo high­lighted how, in the Asia-Pa­cific re­gion alone, the amount of work­ing hours lost in the se­cond quar­ter of the year was equiv­a­lent to 235 mil­lion full-time jobs.</p>
    <p>Vul­ner­a­ble work­ers in in­for­mal and low-wage work were the hard­est hit.</p>
    <p>“We (Asean coun­tries) face com­mon chal­lenges re­lated to the dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion of in­dus­tries, im­ple­ment­ing safe work­place mea­sures and adapt­ing HR (hu­man re­source) strate­gies to en­able work­ers to ful­fil their po­ten­tial,” said the min­is­ter in her key­note ad­dress at the start of the three-day HR Tech Fes­ti­val Asia con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>The new re­gional cen­tre was mooted by Sin­ga­pore at a con­fer­ence last year, where Asean labour min­is­ters adopted a joint state­ment on the fu­ture of work.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre will sup­port Asean in putting the state­ment into ac­tion by fo­cus­ing on three ar­eas that have be­come even more rel­e­vant dur­ing the pan­demic, said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>The first i nvolves em­brac­ing tech­nol­ogy for in­clu­sive growth. The Covid-19 pan­demic has shown that the work­force’s adop­tion of tech­nol­ogy can be sped up if there is a strong enough im­pe­tus, noted the min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>Pri­ori­tis­ing work­place safety and health, in­clud­ing the fight against virus trans­mis­sion, is also of grow­ing importance and an area of con­sen­sus, she said.</p>
    <p>Lastly, tri­par­tite col­lab­o­ra­tion in de­sign­ing prac­ti­cal so­lu­tions to ad­dress emerg­ing chal­lenges is ever more crit­i­cal amid a con­tin­u­ing eco­nomic cri­sis.</p>
    <p>“Whether it is cre­at­ing new jobs and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties, im­ple­ment­ing cost-cut­ting mea­sures or man­ag­ing ex­cess man­power, gov­ern­ments, em­ploy­ers’ and work­ers’ or­gan­i­sa­tions must work to­gether to en­sure that busi­nesses and work­ers can con­tinue to thrive dur­ing this pan­demic and beyond, es­pe­cially those in lower-end and more pre­car­i­ous jobs,” said Mrs Teo.</p>
    <p>She said the cen­tre’s first ini­tia­tive is the Asean Fu­ture of Work con­fer­ence track, part of the HR Tech Fes­ti­val Asia event.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre is also work­ing with the Work­place Safety and Health Council to or­gan­ise the Sin­ga­pore Work­place Safety and Health eCon­fer­ence 2020 in Novem­ber, and plans to or­gan­ise a work­shop called Lead­ers In Tri­par­tism early next year.</p>
    <p>For a start, it will have as ad­vis­ers Asean sec­re­tary-gen­eral Lim Jock Hoi, Korea Oc­cu­pa­tional Safety and Health Agency pres­i­dent Park Doo-yong and Sin­ga­pore’s Na­tional Trades Union Congress pres­i­dent Mary Liew, who is a deputy mem­ber of the work­ers’ group of the In­ter­na­tional Labour Or­gan­i­sa­tion’s gov­ern­ing body.</p>
    <p>A Mi n i s t r y of Man­power spokesman told The Straits Times that the full slate of ad­vis­ers will be an­nounced later this year, and that the cen­tre is hosted and staffed by a team from the min­istry.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing about the im­pact of Covid-19 on labour mar­kets, Mrs Teo said work­ers in Sin­ga­pore have not been spared.</p>
    <p>But in man­ag­ing the cri­sis, there is also the op­por­tu­nity to pre­pare for an even­tual eco­nomic re­cov­ery and for the fu­ture of work, she said.</p>
    <p>“We can do this by help­ing work­ers stay em­ployed and em­ploy­able, en­sur­ing safe work­ing and trans­form­ing our econ­omy and busi­nesses to seize op­por­tu­ni­ties. Th­ese con­tinue to be pri­or­i­ties for Sin­ga­pore, even as we fo­cus on bat­tling the public health cri­sis,” she added.</p>
