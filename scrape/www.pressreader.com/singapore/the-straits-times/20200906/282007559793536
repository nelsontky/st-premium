    <p>VIENNA • Iran has let the UN nu­clear watch­dog in­spect one of the two sites it agreed last month to grant ac­cess to af­ter a pro­tracted stand­off, while Te­heran’s stock­pile of en­riched ura­nium has risen fur­ther, quar­terly re­ports by t he agency said on Fri­day.</p>
    <p>The In­ter­na­tional Atomic En­ergy Agency (IAEA) in­spected one of the sites and took en­vi­ron­men­tal sam­ples there, one of the two re­ports ob­tained by Reuters said, re­fer­ring to sam­ples aimed at de­tect­ing traces of nu­clear ma­te­rial that may have been present.</p>
    <p>The agency’s in­spec­tors will visit the other site “later in Septem­ber 2020 on a date al­ready agreed with Iran, to take en­vi­ron­men­tal sam­ples”, the re­port said.</p>
    <p>The other re­port said that Iran’s stock of low-en­riched ura­nium (LEU) rose by 534kg in the most re­cent quar­ter, roughly the same amount as in the pre­vi­ous three months, to 2,105.4kg. That is more than 10 times the 202.8kg limit set by Iran’s 2015 nu­clear ac­cord with big pow­ers, which Iran has been breach­ing in re­sponse to Wash­ing­ton’s with­drawal from the deal in 2018 and reim­po­si­tion of sanc­tions against Te­heran.</p>
    <p>The stock­pile, how­ever, re­mains far below the many tonnes of en­riched ura­nium Iran had ac­cu­mu­lated be­fore the 2015 deal. Te­heran is en­rich­ing up to a fis­sile pu­rity of 4.5 per cent, which, while above the deal’s 3.67 per cent limit, is still far short of the 20 per cent level it achieved be­fore the deal.</p>
    <p>Roughly 90 per cent pu­rity is con­sid­ered weapons-grade, suit­able for an atomic bomb.</p>
    <p>Iran agreed on Aug 26, dur­ing the first visit to Te­heran by IAEA di­rec­tor-gen­eral Rafael Grossi, to al­low ac­cess for United Na­tions in­spec­tors to two sites sus­pected of once host­ing covert ura­nium con­ver­sion and nu­clear test­ing ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>While the IAEA says it has the right to ex­am­ine such sites with­out per­mis­sion, Iran ob­jected be­cause at least some of the in­for­ma­tion about them came from a trove of doc­u­ments on its past ac­tiv­i­ties that Te­heran’s main Mid­dle East ad­ver­sary, Is­rael, says it seized inside Iran.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, Pres­i­dent Has­san Rouhani yes­ter­day be­moaned Iran’s friends for not stand­ing up to the United States and break­ing crip­pling sanc­tions dur­ing the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>He also said that if the US had a “bit of hu­man­ity or brain”, it would have lifted sanc­tions on Iran for the du­ra­tion of the health cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The United States has threat­ened to im­pose sanc­tions on who­ever con­ducts busi­ness with Iran.</p>
    <p>The sanc­tions are part of the US ef­fort to slash Ira­nian rev­enues af­ter US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump with­drew in 2018 from the 2015 Iran nu­clear deal.</p>
    <p>Iran, with more than 380,000 reg­is­tered cases and over 22,000 deaths from Covid-19, is one of the coun­tries worst hit by the pan­demic in the Mid­dle East.</p>
    <p>“Over the past months since the coro­n­avirus ar­rived in our coun­try... no one came to our help,” Mr Rouhani said in re­marks broad­cast live on Ira­nian state tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>At the same time, he said, “not a sin­gle friendly coun­try told us that in this time of coro­n­avirus and hard­ship and for the sake of hu­man­ity ‘we will stand up to Amer­ica’” and do busi­ness with Iran de­spite threats of US re­tal­i­a­tion.</p>
