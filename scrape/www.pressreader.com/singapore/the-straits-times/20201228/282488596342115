    <p>Premier League club Wolver­hamp­ton Wan­der­ers have banned their play­ers from shop­ping, amid fears they could catch the coro­n­avirus with in­fec­tions ris­ing across Eng­land.</p>
    <p>Test­ing for play­ers and staff in foot­ball’s top flight is to dou­ble to twice a week in ar­eas of the coun­try un­der Tier 4 re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Last Mon­day’s round of test­ing in the league re­vealed seven pos­i­tive cases from 1,569 tests.</p>
    <p>How­ever, since then, Manchester City have con­firmed an­other four pos­i­tive tests for Gabriel Je­sus, Kyle Walker and two staff mem­bers and as such, Wolves are tak­ing no chances.</p>
    <p>“We have staff to go shop­ping and to the su­per­mar­kets for them,” man­ager Nuno Espir­ito Santo said. “We have to avoid any kind of risk be­cause we have a small squad and we have prob­lems with some play­ers out.</p>
    <p>“We can­not af­ford to lose any player, we tell them on a daily ba­sis, ‘Don’t re­lax and try to be more care­ful’.”</p>
    <p>Wolves also told play­ers to avoid su­per­mar­kets dur­ing Bri­tain’s first three-month lock­down be­tween March and May.</p>
    <p>“Our kitchen staff puts to­gether a big box of the ba­sic things that we need,” added Nuno. “Dur­ing the high mo­ment of the pan­demic ev­ery­body had it.</p>
    <p>“When the sit­u­a­tion im­proved, we said to play­ers, ‘You are free to go and do your own shop­ping’.</p>
    <p>“But now as the lev­els are in­creas­ing so high, and we have this new mu­ta­tion that ev­ery­one is so wor­ried about, we start putting this to­gether again. It’s about pro­tect­ing our­selves.”</p>
    <p>Un­like dur­ing Project Restart in June when the Premier League con­ducted twice-weekly manda­tory Covid-19 tests, only one test is car­ried out per week this sea­son.</p>
    <p>But fol­low­ing a se­vere out­break that led to the first post­pone­ment of a Premier League game this sea­son, New­cas­tle boss Steve Bruce wants the test­ing to be upped.</p>
    <p>Given that the new Covid mu­ta­tion, which is re­port­edly 70 per cent more trans­mis­si­ble and has led to other coun­tries im­pos­ing travel bans on Bri­tain, is spread­ing through­out the coun­try, Nuno be­lieves it is com­mon sense to ramp up test­ing for all clubs.</p>
    <p>“The in­fec­tion rate is in­creas­ing so much. Maybe it is nec­es­sary and un­for­tu­nately, we have to go back to two tests per week,” he said.</p>
    <p>“We need to avoid po­ten­tial sit­u­a­tions where play­ers ar­rive at the ground, and then find they have tested pos­i­tive and are un­able to play.”</p>
