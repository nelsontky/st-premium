    <p>New of­fer­ings kept com­ing in re­cent months: Banksy, Ge­orge Condo, Zao Wou-Ki.</p>
    <p>A New York start-up that al­lows in­vestors to buy a tiny stake in paint­ings by world-class artists for just US$20 (S$27) has seen a surge in de­mand dur­ing the pan­demic, ac­cord­ing to its founder, and it has bought 15 art­works since the on­set of Covid-19 to feed their ap­petite.</p>
    <p>A re­cent US$1.52 mil­lion ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing of a piece by the Amer­i­can graf­fiti artist Kaws sold out in a few hours.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple feel that eq­uity mar­kets are over­val­ued and they are look­ing for other places to put money,” said col­lec­tor Scott Lynn, who started the com­pany, Master­works, in 2017.</p>
    <p>Master­works is at the fore­front of a bur­geon­ing niche in frac­tional own­er­ship in lux­ury as­sets such as fine art, col­lectibles, vin­tage cars and even race horses such as Authen­tic, the win­ner of this year’s Ken­tucky Derby last Sat­ur­day.</p>
    <p>The start-ups of­fer the shares as an af­ford­able way to in­vest in ex­pen­sive, rar­efied fields that are typ­i­cally avail­able only to the mega-rich.</p>
    <p>Think of it as the art mar­ket’s ver­sion of the pop­u­lar trad­ing plat­form Robin­hood Mar­kets, which lets users buy a frac­tion of a com­pany’s share for a few dol­lars. It mir­rors the democrati­sa­tion move­ment un­fold­ing in the stock mar­ket – ex­cept that the as­sets are in­her­ently more risky and lack­ing of a track record.</p>
    <p>Auc­tions are filled with ca­su­al­ties, and even works by star artists can im­plode once prices get over­heated.</p>
    <p>The con­cept of frac­tional own­er­ship is not new in the art mar­ket – or for thor­ough­breds. It is a buyer-beware in­vest­ment: Robin­hood it­self is un­der pres­sure af­ter com­plaints from novice in­vestors and is fac­ing a United States reg­u­la­tory probe.</p>
    <p>But the pan­demic has height­ened the taste for those risky bets.</p>
    <p>It is about the ex­pe­ri­ence and the ex­cite­ment of own­ing a part of some­thing unique – even as many will likely take a loss.</p>
    <p>“Folks are stuck in the house, bored, and, if they’re lucky enough to be work­ing, aren’t spend­ing money on things they nor­mally would,” said Bloomberg In­tel­li­gence an­a­lyst David Rit­ter. “So, they have money to play with.”</p>
    <p>Mr James Scol­lick, 40, an avid user of Robin­hood from Los An­ge­les, dis­cov­ered Master­works on In­sta­gram in July and in­vested US$10,000 two weeks later.</p>
    <p>Half of that went into buy­ing shares of a Condo paint­ing and the rest into sec­ondary-mar­ket shares for Banksy’s “Mona Lisa”.</p>
    <p>“It felt like a nat­u­ral way to in­vest some of my money,” he said.</p>
    <p>Master­works has been draw­ing about 10,000 new users a month dur­ing the pan­demic, Mr Lynn said, and it is not alone.</p>
    <p>Ac­qui­cent, a com­pany founded last year to de­velop a trad­ing plat­form for frac­tional-share own­ers of clas­sic cars, saw an 80 per cent jump in the num­ber of po­ten­tial in­vestors in the past three months, ac­cord­ing to founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive An­thony Ci­trano. “It’s an as­set class that 99.9 per cent of peo­ple could not touch or­di­nar­ily,” he said.</p>
    <p>“As far as peo­ple in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing, it’s very hot right now.”</p>
    <p>At MyRacehors­e, the num­ber of in­vestors has tripled since April, ac­cord­ing to founder Michael Behrens. More than 12,000 in­vestors watched a race at Santa Anita Park in Cal­i­for­nia on Zoom re­cently, some wear­ing #myrace­horsewins T-shirts and hats.</p>
    <p>In June, the two-year-old com­pany bought a 12.5 per cent stake in Authen­tic, in a deal that val­ued the race­horse at US$15 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“You have to go into it un­der­stand­ing that it’s not a tra­di­tional in­vest­ment,” Mr Behrens said.</p>
    <p>“We en­cour­age peo­ple to em­brace the ex­pe­ri­en­tial part of it.”</p>
    <p>Otis, a one-year-old firm of­fer­ing emerg­ing art and col­lectibles such as sneak­ers and comic books, is also see­ing an in­crease in de­mand.</p>
    <p>Of the 35 pieces it owns, 20 were pur­chased since March, ac­cord­ing to founder Michael Karn­janaprakor­n.</p>
    <p>Shares go for as low as US$10.</p>
    <p>The most ex­pen­sive of­fer­ing was a US$425,000 paint­ing by Banksy.</p>
    <p>“Maybe two years ago, this seemed like a very stupid idea,” said</p>
    <p>Mr Karn­janaprakor­n.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple were like, ‘Why would you do that?’ – now it’s a real thing.”</p>
    <p>The frac­tional-own­er­ship com­pa­nies have dif­fer­ent busi­ness mod­els, but most file doc­u­ments with the US Se­cu­ri­ties and Ex­change Com­mis­sion and host ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ings sim­i­lar to new eq­uity is­sues.</p>
    <p>At Master­works, there is a sec­ondary ex­change mar­ket for those in­ter­ested in quicker re­turns by trad­ing shares. In re­cent months, the com­pany has emerged as an ac­tive buyer of works un­der US$5 mil­lion even as deals in the broader art mar­ket slowed down.</p>
    <p>It ac­quired 15 art­works for US$31.8 mil­lion since March 17, com­pared with five in the pre­vi­ous two years, ac­cord­ing to Mr Lynn, who added that he plans to spend more than US$100 mil­lion on art this year.</p>
    <p>Master­works buys at auc­tions or through pri­vate sales, plan­ning to hold on to the works for as many as seven years. It charges a 1.5 per cent an­nual man­age­ment fee and takes 20 per cent of the profit when the pieces even­tu­ally sell.</p>
    <p>To keep up with de­mand, Mr Lynn more than dou­bled his staff to 40 peo­ple since March.</p>
    <p>User Aaron Shu­maker, 37, has spent more than US$200,000 on shares of six art­works at Master­works in the past year, in­clud­ing by Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Yayoi Kusama.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think I’d feel so com­fort­able to have one of these works dis­played on my wall,” said the Washington, DC-based en­tre­pre­neur, who has not laid eyes on any of his hold­ings.</p>
    <p>“That seems like a lot of risk.” In­stead, he is happy for Master­works to store them in a fa­cil­ity with proper se­cu­rity, cli­mate con­trol and in­sur­ance, while he hopes to make a fi­nan­cial re­turn on his in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>The sober­ing re­al­ity is that most art does not go up in value.</p>
    <p>“Even great, great artists be­come over­val­ued to the rest of the mar­ket,” said Mr Jef­frey Deitch, who co­founded an art ad­vi­sory ser­vice for Citibank in 1979 and has cham­pi­oned street art as a gallery owner and mu­seum di­rec­tor.</p>
    <p>“There were times when I bought works of art, when I was con­vinced it would be a great score, and I barely got out alive.”</p>
