    <p>FAN­TAS­TIC WHILE IT LASTED</p>
    <p>What hap­pened af­ter was un­for­tu­nate, but we tried to make the most of what­ever train­ing ses­sions and games we had to­gether. And that’s what made it spe­cial. ’’</p>
    <p>JEF­FREY LIGHT­FOOT, then Cubs cap­tain, on en­joy­ing their great ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>A decade af­ter Singapore made his­tory by be­com­ing host of the in­au­gu­ral 2010 Youth Olympic Games, The Straits</p>
    <p>Times looks at the im­pact and legacy of the event and the youth ath­letes who in­spired a na­tion. This is the sec­ond of a two-part se­ries.</p>
    <p>Even min­utes be­fore their first match at the 2010 Youth Olympic Games (YOG), not a sin­gle Singapore foot­baller knew what to ex­pect.</p>
    <p>“In the chang­ing room, we were won­der­ing among our­selves about what the crowd was go­ing to be like,” re­called winger Bran­don Koh.</p>
    <p>“We were jok­ing that maybe it could be sim­i­lar to the Asian Youth Games (a year prior), with just a few fans here and there in the stands.”</p>
    <p>The Singapore Un­der-15 boys got their an­swer soon af­ter, from the hair-raising re­cep­tion their two goal­keep­ers got when they strode out first onto the Jalan Be­sar Sta­dium field for the warm-up.</p>
    <p>“We all turned to one an­other,” said Koh, “and asked: Did you hear that?”</p>
    <p>Close to 5,000 fans turned up at the 6,000-ca­pac­ity Jalan Be­sar Sta­dium for that game against Zim­babwe and wit­nessed the Cubs post a 3-1 win which trans­formed them, al­most overnight, into the new dar­lings of Singapore foot­ball.</p>
    <p>With a multi-racial mix – three Chi­nese, one In­dian, one Eurasian and six Malay boys made up the first XI – the team cap­tured the at­ten­tion of lo­cal fans.</p>
    <p>Their whole­hearted, de­ter­mined dis­plays and slick skil­ful play – drilled by former na­tional de­fender Kadir Ya­haya – also made them a favourite with fans.</p>
    <p>Now all aged 25, eight mem­bers of the squad re­turned to their old Jalan Be­sar stomp­ing ground to re­flect on the ex­pe­ri­ence which cul­mi­nated with them win­ning a bronze medal.</p>
    <p>Bo­livia took the YOG gold af­ter beat­ing Haiti 5-0 in the fi­nal.</p>
    <p>De­spite the packed stands through­out the tour­na­ment with over 21,000 at­tend­ing their four matches – in­clud­ing Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong, who watched their sec­ond game against Mon­tene­gro – the Singapore play­ers claimed they did not feel the weight of ex­pec­ta­tion or re­alise the buzz they were cre­at­ing.</p>
    <p>“We were just fo­cused on the foot­ball and re­ally, just liv­ing in the mo­ment,” said de­fender Illyas Lee.</p>
    <p>Fel­low de­fender Dhukhi­lan Jee­va­mani said the team’s fol­low­ing only dawned on him when he was sus­pended for the semi-fi­nal against Haiti and no­ticed, from the stands, fans try­ing to catch the sold-out game from atop the multi-storey carpark next to Jalan Be­sar.</p>
    <p>Team skip­per Jef­frey Light­foot added: “At the ap­pre­ci­a­tion din­ner (a month af­ter the YOG), one of the Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Singapore staff gave each of us a book­let of all the news­pa­per ar­ti­cles that were writ­ten about the team. Only then did we re­alise how big (the im­pact) had been.”</p>
    <p>For all their happy mem­o­ries, the play­ers are still ran­kled by what hap­pened af­ter the YOG. To­day, only two from the 18-strong squad – goal­keeper Fashah Iskan­dar and for­ward Muhaimin Suhaimi – play foot­ball pro­fes­sion­ally. None have earned a cap for the se­nior Lions.</p>
    <p>Some in the lo­cal fra­ter­nity have la­belled them the “lost gen­er­a­tion”, and when asked how they felt about the de­scrip­tion, the hulk­ing Fashah, who was largely quiet dur­ing the in­ter­view, replied tersely: “How do you think we feel?”</p>
    <p>Shak­ing his head, Muhaimin said: “Af­ter the YOG, there was no fol­low-up… We had no coach, and we didn’t even have a sin­gle train­ing ses­sion for seven or eight months.”</p>
    <p>Kadir, a highly re­spected coach but one who did not al­ways see eye to eye with the top brass in FAS, left just five months af­ter the YOG.</p>
    <p>De­spite this, the play­ers proved their YOG show­ing was no flash in the pan when they knocked out the youth sides of Ju­ven­tus and Ever­ton en route to a run­ner-up fin­ish in the 2011 Lion City Cup un­der Ja­panese coach Takuma Koga.</p>
    <p>Still, the squad was bro­ken up just two years later when most were let go from the now-de­funct Na­tional Foot­ball Academy af­ter they turned 18.</p>
    <p>Said mid­fielder Am­mirul Emm­ran: “Right af­ter the YOG, a lot of peo­ple said a lot of things about us and what was ahead.</p>
    <p>“But in terms of on-the-ground work, noth­ing was re­ally done… We were on our own, things soon went down­hill, and even­tu­ally they for­got about us.”</p>
    <p>With a pained smile, Koh added: “Through­out that whole (jour­ney), you saw our de­vel­op­ment – from be­ing noth­ing, to some­thing, to be­com­ing no-ones.”</p>
    <p>Dhukhi­lan said they have come to terms with the re­al­ity of not be­ing able to ful­fil their po­ten­tial as a team, but also said: “We would rather be thought of as the boys who cre­ated his­tory in the first YOG, who helped bring the na­tion to­gether through foot­ball.”</p>
    <p>While they were not all able to pur­sue their passion as a ca­reer, many of the YOG squad have gone on to fur­ther their stud­ies. Among the eight that The Straits Times in­ter­viewed, Light­foot has a Bach­e­lor’s de­gree in com­mu­ni­ca­tions, while four oth­ers are pur­su­ing their de­grees.</p>
    <p>Dhukhi­lan be­lieves their YOG ad­ven­ture also helped the play­ers de­velop into “good hu­man be­ings”.</p>
    <p>He re­counted a story about how, on a train­ing tour in Aus­tralia, Kadir tore into the en­tire squad be­cause no­body had thanked the bus driver when they alighted the bus upon ar­riv­ing at the team ho­tel.</p>
    <p>“He gave us the hairdryer treat­ment, kicked a chair and every­thing, and scolded us say­ing, ‘Who do you think you are’, things like that,” added Lee, with a chuckle.</p>
    <p>“Be­cause of that, even now when I take the SBS (pub­lic) bus, I greet the driver,” quipped Fashah, leav­ing the whole group howl­ing in laugh­ter.</p>
    <p>Even af­ter a decade, the group still share a close bond, which was ev­i­dent dur­ing the hour-long in­ter­view at Jalan Be­sar. They still meet at least once a year to play fut­sal or a foot­ball game.</p>
    <p>Said Light­foot: “The whole YOG was a mag­i­cal ex­pe­ri­ence. What hap­pened af­ter was un­for­tu­nate, but we tried to make the most of what­ever train­ing ses­sions and games we had to­gether. And that’s what made it spe­cial.”</p>
