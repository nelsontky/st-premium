    <p>In the past four weeks, the world greeted the con­tin­ual pos­i­tive find­ings from sev­eral late-stage Covid-19 vac­cine tri­als with loud cheers. Global stock mar­kets ral­lied, and the surge in share prices of avi­a­tion and tourism coun­ters re­vealed the widespread op­ti­mism of the world about a re­turn to pre-Covid-19 nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>This en­thu­si­asm is re­in­forced when­ever gov­ern­ments world­wide an­nounce their plans to pro­cure and de­liver the vac­cines, re­gard­less of the im­por­tant caveat to pri­ori­tise lim­ited vac­cine doses for front-line work­ers and high-risk groups be­fore mass distri­bu­tion to the rest of the pop­u­la­tion is pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>What has been over­looked in this vac­cine furore, how­ever, is the dis­tinc­tion be­tween pro­tect­ing in­di­vid­u­als from in­fec­tion and mor­tal­ity, and al­low­ing so­ci­eties and com­mu­ni­ties to re­turn to pre-Covid-19 nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>While the two ob­jec­tives may ap­pear to be aligned, there are</p>
    <p>fun­da­men­tal dif­fer­ences in the re­quire­ments to at­tain the de­sired out­comes. Nu­mer­ous re­ports have dis­cussed how the avail­abil­ity and pub­lic ac­cep­tance of safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cines make a pow­er­ful con­tri­bu­tion to the ex­ist­ing pub­lic health tool­kit in the fight against Covid-19 that in­cludes mask wear­ing and so­cial dis­tanc­ing to pro­tect peo­ple against in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, this nar­ra­tive tends to fo­cus on how the risk to in­di­vid­u­als is low­ered and, in re­turn, the health­care ser­vices are pro­tected from be­ing over­whelmed, but it does not ac­tu­ally ad­dress how so­ci­eties can re­turn to reg­u­lar ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The lat­ter can hap­pen only when ap­pro­pri­ate na­tional and in­ter­na­tional in­fra­struc­ture is es­tab­lished for record­ing and ver­i­fy­ing who has re­ceived an ac­cred­ited vac­cine.</p>
    <p>This sounds triv­ial, but the re­al­ity is far from so.</p>
    <p>Lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenges</p>
    <p>Let us start from the fact that, re­gard­less of the sup­ply of vac­cines that is avail­able to a coun­try, it will be im­pos­si­ble to ex­pect ev­ery­one to be vac­ci­nated.</p>
    <p>This may be due to the lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenges of vac­ci­nat­ing mil­lions of peo­ple dis­trib­uted over a vast ge­o­graph­i­cal ex­panse, the in­abil­ity to reach out to ev­ery­one in a</p>
    <p>com­mu­nity, or sim­ply im­per­fect knowl­edge of the vac­cine lead­ing to peo­ple be­ing hes­i­tant and re­luc­tant to get vac­ci­nated. Af­ter all, th­ese are the rea­sons why the up­take of life-sav­ing vac­cines such as those for small­pox, in­fluenza, and the hu­man pa­pil­lo­mavirus re­mains im­per­fect in most coun­tries.</p>
    <p>This means that at any one time, there will be groups of peo­ple within a com­mu­nity that have not been vac­ci­nated. The ques­tion then is – how does so­ci­ety dis­tin­guish be­tween those who have been vac­ci­nated and those who have not? Fol­low­ing from that, there is the ques­tion of whether there should be dif­fer­ent rules for th­ese two broad cat­e­gories of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, should a pub owner be empowered to re­ject pa­trons who have not been vac­ci­nated? Or a school prin­ci­pal man­dated to block un­vac­ci­nated stu­dents from at­tend­ing classes? Th­ese ex­am­ples may sound ex­treme, but al­ready some in­ter­na­tional air­lines</p>
    <p>have an­nounced the fu­ture re­quire­ment for proof of vac­ci­na­tion from pas­sen­gers prior to em­barka­tion. Cur­rently, the only vac­ci­na­tion man­dated for in­ter­na­tional travel is for yel­low fever, and even that is re­quired only when one trav­els to and from an en­demic coun­try.</p>
    <p>An In­ter­na­tional Cer­tifi­cate of Vac­ci­na­tion is awarded when­ever one re­ceives an ap­proved yel­low fever vac­cine, and this frame­work is gov­erned by the In­ter­na­tional Health Reg­u­la­tions (IHR) un­der the purview of the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>As yel­low fever is en­demic only to a hand­ful of coun­tries in the tropics where to­tal in­ter­na­tional traffic is com­par­a­tively light, vac­ci­na­tion cer­tifi­cates have re­mained in a pa­per form that is in­spected by bor­der con­trol of­fi­cials upon en­try and exit.</p>
    <p>It is safe to as­sume that Covid-19 will be­come en­demic in most coun­tries glob­ally, and this im­plies that a vac­cine cer­ti­fi­ca­tion sys­tem for the coro­n­avirus must be scal­able and adapt­able for use by bil­lions world­wide.</p>
    <p>Will WHO then es­tab­lish new guide­lines un­der the IHR specif­i­cally to ac­credit Covid-19 vac­cines, and to co­or­di­nate the es­tab­lish­ment of a global cer­ti­fi­ca­tion sys­tem that is elec­tronic in­stead of in pa­per form?</p>
    <p>The ac­cred­i­ta­tion process alone is fraught with mas­sive po­lit­i­cal haz­ards, given the lack of trans­parency over the ef­fi­cacy and safety of some vac­cines that are al­ready be­ing dis­trib­uted in some coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Health in­for­ma­tion sys­tems</p>
    <p>Be­yond in­ter­na­tional con­sid­er­a­tions, proof of vac­ci­na­tion may soon be nec­es­sary within a coun­try in or­der for in­di­vid­u­als to move about and in­ter­act with oth­ers more freely in the com­mu­nity. This re­quires a na­tional frame­work to record who has been vac­ci­nated, and that th­ese records be ac­ces­si­ble to in­di­vid­u­als or cor­po­ra­tions.</p>
    <p>The good news is that a na­tional sys­tem to record and ver­ify vac­ci­na­tions al­ready ex­ists in many coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, and this can be mod­i­fied and adapted to per­mit</p>
    <p>the re­trieval of Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion records.</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, the na­tional im­mu­ni­sa­tion sched­ules for chil­dren and adults can be aug­mented to in­clude the Covid-19 vac­cine. The in­for­ma­tion can then be di­rectly linked to a dig­i­tal plat­form such as TraceTo­gether to al­low for a straight­for­ward ver­i­fi­ca­tion of vac­ci­na­tion – cer­tainly an im­por­tant el­e­ment to per­mit the re­sump­tion of mass ac­tiv­i­ties and gath­er­ings.</p>
    <p>Even for those coun­tries still in the process of es­tab­lish­ing or im­prov­ing their health in­for­ma­tion sys­tems, the push to record and ver­ify Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tions prop­erly means over­seas de­vel­op­ment aid fund­ing can be mo­bilised. This may ac­tu­ally im­prove their abil­ity to de­liver all forms of life-sav­ing vac­ci­na­tion and not just that for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The bad news, how­ever, is that when coun­tries adopt their own na­tional so­lu­tions for record­ing and ver­i­fy­ing, con­verg­ing to­wards a global con­sen­sus may be im­pos­si­ble with­out an over­ar­ch­ing in­ter­na­tional frame­work.</p>
    <p>Clearly, na­tional records must be made in­ter­op­er­a­ble with an in­ter­na­tional sys­tem to per­mit the recog­ni­tion and use of such elec­tronic cer­ti­fi­ca­tions across bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Th­ese in­ter­na­tional co­or­di­na­tion frame­works and in­fra­struc­ture are nec­es­sary be­fore the avail­abil­ity of safe and ef­fec­tive vac­cines trans­lates into the re­turn to pre-Covid-19 nor­malcy.</p>
    <p>As such, bi­lat­eral ar­range­ments be­tween a hand­ful of coun­tries to recog­nise mu­tual vac­ci­na­tion strate­gies will per­haps be nec­es­sary in the short term to restart in­ter­na­tional travel. Oth­er­wise, I am less san­guine about that flight to any over­seas hol­i­day des­ti­na­tion in the next 12 months.</p>
    <p>In the above nar­ra­tive, we have not even dis­cussed the ad­di­tional com­plex­i­ties of the vac­ci­na­tion roll-out, not least the fact that in most coun­tries the process is likely to be patchy ini­tially be­cause of lim­ited sup­plies. There is also the pos­si­bil­ity that vac­cines may con­fer only short-term pro­tec­tion, and re­peated vac­ci­na­tions are nec­es­sary for life­long de­fence against Sars-CoV-2.</p>
    <p>So while there is cer­tainly light at the end of the tun­nel, it still re­mains a very long tun­nel ahead. What each of us can do at this point in time is to make an ef­fort to learn about the Covid-19 vac­cines be­fore they are ready for distri­bu­tion. In do­ing so, we are play­ing our role as re­spon­si­ble cit­i­zens of the world as we start walk­ing to­wards the light.</p>
