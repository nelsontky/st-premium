    <p>SEOUL • South Korea’s big­gest golf tour­na­ment was moved to Las Ve­gas be­cause of coronaviru­s restric­tions yes­ter­day, with the rest of the PGA Tour’s US$30 mil­lion (S$41 mil­lion) Asian swing look­ing in doubt.</p>
    <p>The CJ Cup, orig­i­nally due to take place on Jeju Is­land from Oct 15-18, will now be played at the Shadow Creek course in Ne­vada on the same dates, the Tour and spon­sors CJ Group said in a joint state­ment.</p>
    <p>South Korea – which had brought its out­break largely un­der con­trol, but is now tack­ling sev­eral clus­ters of in­fec­tions – has im­posed strict lim­its on travel, with all ar­rivals re­quired to spend two weeks in quar­an­tine.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, the Tour said it was in talks over the fate of Ja­pan’s Zozo Cham­pi­onship and the WGC-HSBC Cham­pi­ons in Shang­hai, which are sched­uled to be held in con­sec­u­tive weeks af­ter the CJ Cup.</p>
    <p>With com­bined purses of US$29.75 mil­lion, the Tour’s three­stop swing has been the high­light of Asia’s golf cal­en­dar in re­cent sea­sons.</p>
    <p>“We are cur­rently en­gaged in dis­cus­sions with the stake­hold­ers of both the Zozo Cham­pi­onship and World Golf Cham­pi­onships-HSBC</p>
    <p>Cham­pi­ons and will make an an­nounce­ment shortly on the sta­tus of both events,” the US-based men’s cir­cuit said in a state­ment to Agence France-Presse.</p>
    <p>The US$10.25 mil­lion Shang­hai tour­na­ment has been un­der a cloud since Chi­nese au­thor­i­ties banned most in­ter­na­tional sports events this year to guard against coronaviru­s out­breaks.</p>
    <p>The maiden Zozo Cham­pi­onship was won last year by Tiger Woods, who equalled Sam Snead’s record of 82 Tour vic­to­ries.</p>
    <p>In its three years of ex­is­tence, the CJ Cup has been won by two for­mer world No. 1s – Justin Thomas in 2017 and last year, ei­ther side of Brooks Koepka’s vic­tory in 2018.</p>
    <p>“While our play­ers have al­ways looked for­ward to vis­it­ing Korea, the cur­rent cir­cum­stances pro­vided this new op­por­tu­nity to bring the event to Las Ve­gas,” said Ty Votaw, the Tour’s ex­ec­u­tive vice pres­i­dent of in­ter­na­tional oper­a­tions. The CJ Group added it planned to bring the event back to South Korea next year.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, re­gional golf suf­fered an­other blow as the Asian Tour, on hold since March, an­nounced the loss of the only re­main­ing event on this year’s cal­en­dar. Next month’s Shin­han Dong­hae Open will now be played as a do­mes­tic event on the Korean Tour be­cause of the travel restric­tions, the Asian body said.</p>
    <p>Just four events, in­clud­ing the SMBC Sin­ga­pore Open, have been pos­si­ble on the Asian Tour this year and all oc­curred be­fore mid-March.</p>
    <p>The LPGA Tour’s BMW Ladies’ Cham­pi­onship, due to be held in Bu­san in Oc­to­ber, could fall by the way­side with of­fi­cials await­ing gov­ern­ment ad­vice if it can go ahead.</p>
    <p>A can­cel­la­tion would leave Novem­ber’s Toto Clas­sic in Ja­pan as the last re­main­ing Asia-based tour­na­ment for the year and that is also said to be in doubt. Should it be scrapped, no LPGA events would be held on the con­ti­nent this year.</p>
