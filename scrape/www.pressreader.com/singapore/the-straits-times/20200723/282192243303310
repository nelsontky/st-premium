    <p>So­lu­tions en­vi­sioned in a postCovid-19 world in­clude bet­ter track­ing and trac­ing of cargo, tap­ping an aug­mented vir­tual re­al­ity plat­form to cre­ate new tourism ex­pe­ri­ences and pi­o­neer­ing a sys­tem that can en­sure a safe work en­vi­ron­ment for the con­struc­tion in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>A call for such so­lu­tions has been launched, with $40 mil­lion set aside for Na­tional In­no­va­tion Chal­lenges (NICs), ini­tia­tives meant to ac­cel­er­ate in­no­va­tion ef­forts and help en­ter­prises de­velop them.</p>
    <p>Seven chal­lenges across five sec­tors – trans­port and lo­gis­tics; built en­vi­ron­ment; meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions (Mice); tourism; and the mar­itime in­dus­try</p>
    <p>– were un­veiled by gov­ern­ment agen­cies En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore (ESG), the In­fo­comm Me­dia De­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity and the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion Sin­ga­pore yesterday.</p>
    <p>They are aimed at ac­cel­er­at­ing in­dus­try-led in­no­va­tion calls to help firms build re­silience and emerge stronger in the post-Covid-19 era.</p>
    <p>Three chal­lenge state­ments, which are also part of ESG’s Trade and Con­nec­tiv­ity Chal­lenge 2020, ad­dress the need for higher ac­cu­racy of ship­ping con­tainer in­spec­tions, tackle the is­sue of more pro­duc­tive track­ing and trac­ing of cargo, and seek to in­crease pro­duc­tiv­ity through ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>The other four aim to po­si­tion Sin­ga­pore as a safe place to con­duct busi­ness both lo­cally and in­ter­na­tion­ally, while help­ing to re­vive the events and con­struc­tion sec­tors after the coro­n­avirus out­break.</p>
    <p>The cross-in­dus­try col­lab­o­ra­tions will tackle the im­me­di­ate need for safe re­open­ing after the pan­demic and also ad­dress mi­dand long-term sec­toral chal­lenges to help firms emerge stronger after the cri­sis, the agen­cies said.</p>
    <p>The next round of chal­lenges is ex­pected to launch in the fourth quar­ter, with up to $2 mil­lion in fund­ing al­lo­cated for each chal­lenge.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat, who an­nounced the se­ries of chal­lenges dur­ing the For­ti­tude Bud­get in May, said in a Face­book post yesterday: “Through th­ese ef­forts, we also hope to build a stronger cul­ture of in­no­va­tion here in Sin­ga­pore – among in­di­vid­u­als, com­pa­nies, trade as­so­ci­a­tions, re­search and aca­demic in­sti­tu­tions and the Gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>“In an in­creas­ingly com­plex and un­cer­tain world, our abil­ity to work to­gether and in­no­vate will give us an edge in seek­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties at home and abroad. Our strengths at home will en­able us to con­trib­ute to the global com­mu­nity.”</p>
    <p>ESG’s Trade and Con­nec­tiv­ity Chal­lenge 2020, which was also launched yesterday, has drawn par­tic­i­pa­tion from 13 cor­po­ra­tions and or­gan­i­sa­tions look­ing for in­no­va­tive so­lu­tions to strengthen sup­ply chain pro­cesses and en­sure busi­ness con­ti­nu­ity.</p>
    <p>Start-ups and firms will work on 28 chal­lenge state­ments fo­cus­ing pri­mar­ily on so­lu­tions that lever­age big data an­a­lyt­ics, au­to­ma­tion, sus­tain­abil­ity and post-Covid-19 ef­forts. The chal­lenge state­ments are di­vided into two tracks – in­dus­tryspe­cific and en­ter­prise-level is­sues.</p>
    <p>Of th­ese, three of them are un­der the in­dus­try track, which is new to this year’s chal­lenge and in­vites cor­po­rates and trade as­so­ci­a­tions and cham­bers to ex­plore so­lu­tions that have the po­ten­tial to be scaled for sec­tor-wide ap­pli­ca­tions. Th­ese chal­lenges, cham­pi­oned by the Con­tainer De­pot and Lo­gis­tics As­so­ci­a­tion Sin­ga­pore, ground-han­dling firm Sats and sup­ply chain player YCH Group, are part of the NICs.</p>
    <p>For the 25 other chal­lenges, un­der the en­ter­prise track, short­listed start-ups will be able to trial and as­sess the ef­fec­tive­ness of so­lu­tions via paid tri­als with cor­po­rates.</p>
    <p>Among the chal­lenges is one from lo­cal car rental com­pany Lu­mens Auto, which is look­ing for technology-en­abled so­lu­tions to re­duce ac­ci­dent rates among driv­ers.</p>
    <p>The prize pool for the en­ter­prise track has been dou­bled to $100,000, with the win­ning start-up re­ceiv­ing $30,000 and a fast track to start-up com­pe­ti­tion Sling­shot 2020.</p>
    <p>The call for en­tries un­der the en­ter­prise track ends on Sept 15, while in­dus­try track sub­mis­sions close on Oct 1. Ap­pli­ca­tions can be sub­mit­ted at https://trade­and­con­nec­tiv­ity.in­no­va­tion-chal­lenge.sg/</p>
    <p>In last year’s in­au­gu­ral chal­lenge, six cor­po­rates put out prob­lem state­ments on themes like blockchain, draw­ing sub­mis­sions from around 50 lo­cal and over­seas en­ti­ties.</p>
