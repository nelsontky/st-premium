    <p>Around 400,000 lower-wage Sin­ga­pore­ans will be re­ceiv­ing $1,500 from Tues­day, their first pay­out of the Work­fare Spe­cial Pay­ment.</p>
    <p>An­nounced by Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat in his Bud­get speech in March, the scheme pro­vides el­i­gi­ble lower-in­come work­ers with a $3,000 cash pay­out that will be given in two equal parts this month and in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>The pay­out will be given to work­ers who were el­i­gi­ble for the Work­fare In­come Sup­ple­ment (WIS) scheme be­fore March 31, for their work done last year.</p>
    <p>WIS tar­gets the bot­tom 20 per cent of the work­force, and is paid in the form of cash and Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund top-ups. Those el­i­gi­ble will re­ceive the pay­out the same way they re­ceive their WIS pay­ments, via di­rect cred­it­ing into their bank ac­count or through a cheque sent to their res­i­den­tial ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Re­cip­i­ents will be no­ti­fied via SMS of pay­ment de­tails if they have reg­is­tered their mo­bile num­bers with SingPass, while oth­ers will re­ceive let­ters by the fol­low­ing week, the Min­istry of Fi­nance (MOF) said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>To ver­ify the au­then­tic­ity of the SMS, re­cip­i­ents should check that the SMS is sent by SG-Work­fare. They will not be asked to re­spond or pro­vide any in­for­ma­tion to the sender.</p>
    <p>Those with gov­ern­ment-reg­is­tered bank ac­counts will re­ceive the July pay­out ear­lier via di­rect bank cred­it­ing on Tues­day. The rest will re­ceive the pay­out later by cheque by Aug 15, said MOF. The sec­ond pay­ment will be is­sued via di­rect bank cred­it­ing on Oct 28, or via cheque by Nov 15, the min­istry added.</p>
    <p>Those who wish to re­ceive the sec­ond pay­out via di­rect bank cred­it­ing can go to the Work­fare web­site by Oct 14.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans who qual­ify for WIS for the 2019 work year af­ter this month and be­fore March 31 next year will re­ceive the full Work­fare Spe­cial Pay­ment in the month that they be­come el­i­gi­ble for the WIS.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post yes­ter­day, DPM Heng said that an in­te­gral part of Work­fare is the ad­di­tional sup­port for train­ing. Work­fare was in­tro­duced in 2007 as a per­ma­nent scheme to ad­dress wage in­equal­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Taken to­gether with Skill­sFu­ture SG and the Pro­gres­sive Wage Model, we have a strong ecosys­tem of sup­port to up­lift our lower-wage work­ers in a sus­tain­able way,” he wrote.</p>
    <p>While many work­ers around the world are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing wage stag­na­tion, lower-wage work­ers in Sin­ga­pore have ex­pe­ri­enced “strong” real wage growth av­er­ag­ing more than 4 per cent a year in the past five years – faster than the growth in me­dian wages, said Mr Heng.</p>
    <p>“We can and we will con­tinue to in­vest in and sup­port our lower-wage work­ers so that they can con­tinue to learn and grow,” he added.</p>
    <p>Around 29,000 lower-in­come Sin­ga­pore­ans who are union mem­bers of the Na­tional Trades Union Congress (NTUC) will also be able to re­ceive up to $100 in as­sis­tance for daily essen­tials and school sup­plies at par­tic­i­pat­ing mer­chants, with an ad­di­tional $100 for each el­i­gi­ble school­go­ing child.</p>
    <p>The NTUC Care Fund (e-Vouch­ers) pro­gramme, which will cost $6 mil­lion this year, will run yearly. More de­tails are avail­able at www.ntuc.org.sg/Care FundEVouch­ers</p>
