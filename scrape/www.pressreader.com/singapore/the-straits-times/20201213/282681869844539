    <p>Clients oc­ca­sion­ally fire highly tech­ni­cal ques­tions at re­gional sales man­ager Lawrence Low that can leave him stumped, which is no great sur­prise given he joined the pre­ci­sion tool­ing sec­tor only a cou­ple of years ago.</p>
    <p>Mr Low cer­tainly jumped into the deep end, hav­ing come out of re­tire­ment and with no engi­neer­ing back­ground.</p>
    <p>But when he tells clients hon­estly about his lim­i­ta­tions, asks to learn from them and as­sures them he will con­sult his engi­neer­ing col­leagues, he has found that it ac­tu­ally strength­ens the re­la­tion­ship.</p>
    <p>“It might be a short­com­ing now, but af­ter meet­ing one client, I learn. The next client I meet might face the same kind of dif­fi­cul­ties and I will be able to over­come it,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Low, 62, had pre­vi­ously worked in the spec­ta­cle whole­sale and aero­space chem­i­cal in­dus­tries be­fore re­tir­ing in 2016.</p>
    <p>He joined Del­phic Man­u­fac­tur­ing So­lu­tion in 2018 on a part-time ba­sis af­ter a friend who worked there alerted him to the open­ing.</p>
    <p>Mr Low went full-time last year af­ter com­plet­ing the Pro­fes­sional Con­ver­sion Pro­gramme for tech­ni­cal sales man­ager, which helped him un­der­stand qual­ity con­trol, de­liv­ery is­sues and cus­tomer ex­pec­ta­tions in man­u­fac­tur­ing.</p>
    <p>Although his pay is lower than what he earned in his last po­si­tion as a gen­eral man­ager, he sees it as part and par­cel of en­ter­ing a new in­dus­try: “It is more im­por­tant to en­joy the new job and grow along</p>
    <p>with it.”</p>
    <p>Mr Low’s wife and son are both work­ing, so his de­ci­sion to re­turn to work was fu­elled not so much by fi­nances but by a de­sire to make good use of his time and keep in touch with mar­ket trends.</p>
    <p>“If I did not come back to work, I wouldn’t know how to use Zoom or Mi­crosoft Teams,” he quipped.</p>
    <p>“I’m glad I get to ac­quire new skills, it keeps life much hap­pier.”</p>
    <p>He cred­its his em­ployer for en­cour­ag­ing staff to un­der­take reg­u­lar train­ing, an op­por­tu­nity he is keen to em­brace.</p>
    <p>Mr Low is now on a course about op­er­a­tions man­age­ment in­no­va­tion and he has com­pleted ones on mar­ket­ing an­a­lyt­ics and emo­tional in­tel­li­gence.</p>
    <p>His ad­vice to other re­tirees who want to re-en­ter the work­force but worry about start­ing afresh in a new field: Put aside your fears and al­ways be will­ing to learn.</p>
    <p>“As re­tirees, we usu­ally stay in our com­fort zones, and there are a lot of un­cer­tain­ties, like will I lose face, will I be able to learn, will col­leagues be able to ac­cept me?</p>
    <p>“If we re­ally want to do some­thing new, we have to erase these fears from our hearts,” he said.</p>

He had no prior ex&#xAD;pe&#xAD;ri&#xAD;ence in man&#xAD;u&#xAD;fac&#xAD;tur&#xAD;ing but was con&#xAD;fi&#xAD;dent about learn&#xAD;ing and con&#xAD;tribut&#xAD;ing in a new field. ST</p>
