    <p>Covid-19 has stalled most in­ter­na­tional travel, but there is still plenty to do right here.</p>
    <p>This was the main mes­sage that Mr Keith Tan, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB), wanted to send to Sin­ga­pore­ans on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>Al­though most Sin­ga­pore­ans may not be able to travel abroad un­til next year, there is no short­age of things to do with their an­nual leave.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to Straits Times travel cor­re­spon­dent Clara Lock, 30, as part of askST@NLB’s sec­ond Novem­ber session, Mr Tan said: “We have a lot more at­trac­tions than most peo­ple think we have. The big hits – the zoo, Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios – those are the tip of the ice­berg. There’s so much to dis­cover.”</p>
    <p>For the past few months, the STB has been work­ing with En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and the Sen­tosa Devel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion on the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers cam­paign.</p>
    <p>In the process, they had to tai­lor ex­pe­ri­ences for the lo­cal mar­ket. Un­like tourists who save and bud­get to travel here, Sin­ga­pore­ans rarely look to spend big lo­cally.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan said this meant that the STB and its tourism part­ners have had to “work harder to cre­ate pack­ages and bun­dles that rep­re­sent good value to Sin­ga­pore­ans”.</p>
    <p>They had no lack of do­mes­tic at­trac­tions to work with. Ms Lock pointed to lo­cal tourism busi­nesses that have sprung up dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, such as Ninja Kayak­ers and In­die Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan agreed that those were</p>
    <p>MANY AT­TRAC­TIONS</p>
    <p>“great ex­am­ples of in­no­va­tive young en­trepreneur­s” and stressed that “STB wants to sup­port such ef­forts”.</p>
    <p>As part of the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers cam­paign, all Sin­ga­pore­ans aged 18 and above will re­ceive $100 worth of vouch­ers next month.</p>
    <p>These can be used for stay­ca­tions, tick­ets to leisure at­trac­tions and lo­cal tours. They will be dis­trib­uted via SingPass in de­nom­i­na­tions of $10, and will be valid un­til the end of June next year.</p>
    <p>The hope is that Sin­ga­pore­ans will dis­cover hid­den gems and un­known his­tory close to home.</p>
    <p>Mr Tan re­counted how he and his fam­ily re­cently ex­plored Lit­tle India, which he had not vis­ited “for al­most 20 years, apart from the main road (Seran­goon Road)”.</p>
    <p>The 46-year-old, who has four chil­dren, de­scribed how they went on a walk­ing tour and dis­cov­ered “beau­ti­ful art­work and mu­rals”, as well as their “new favourite place to eat naan and but­ter chicken”.</p>
    <p>Given the pan­demic, clean­li­ness and hy­giene will re­main the pri­mary con­cern of peo­ple ven­tur­ing out­doors.</p>
    <p>As at Oct 30, the STB has given more than 1,300 SG Clean Qual­ity Mark cer­tifi­cates to tourism en­ter</p>
    <p>Board. prises. These sig­nal that the es­tab­lish­ment in ques­tion is com­mit­ted to up­hold­ing good san­i­ta­tion and hy­giene prac­tices.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Mr Tan also ex­pressed his be­lief in the im­por­tance of “our na­tional pos­ture, our per­sonal at­ti­tudes, our be­hav­iours” in the long term.</p>
    <p>“I firmly be­lieve that there’s a lot here in Sin­ga­pore that makes us quite unique,” he said. “I hope that Sin­ga­pore­ans will take the time to slow down, step out and be proud of this beau­ti­ful lit­tle coun­try we have.”</p>
    <p>We have a lot more at­trac­tions than most peo­ple think we have. The big hits – the zoo, Uni­ver­sal Stu­dios – those are the tip of the ice­berg. There’s so much to dis­cover.</p>
