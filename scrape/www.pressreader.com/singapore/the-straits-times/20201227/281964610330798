    <p>The amount of food waste gen­er­ated in Sin­ga­pore has risen by about 20 per cent over the past 10 years and is ex­pected to in­crease with the grow­ing pop­u­la­tion and eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity. Yet only 18 per cent of the to­tal food waste was re­cy­cled last year, ac­cord­ing to the NEA. But things are chang­ing as more Sin­ga­pore­ans and lo­cal com­pa­nies are be­com­ing more en­vi­ron­men­tally con­scious.</p>
    <p>The Sunday Times, in part­ner­ship with DBS Bank, gets to the bot­tom of up­cy­cling, as Ju­dith Tan and Vanessa Liu check out how four groups have added value to food waste.</p>
    <p>Food waste is one of the big­gest waste streams in Sin­ga­pore. While the au­thor­i­ties look at how to con­vert food waste into high value prod­ucts that can give back to the econ­omy, var­i­ous groups have taken steps to up­cy­cle food waste.</p>
    <p>Big fu­ture in tiny in­sects</p>
    <p>The hum­ble black sol­dier fly, with its vo­ra­cious appetite as larva, is be­ing har­nessed to eat dis­carded food and cre­ate rich nu­tri­ents for plants and an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>This ubiq­ui­tous and harm­less in­sect is be­ing put to good use in the val­ori­sa­tion of food waste, which oth­er­wise has negative value as it can­not be re­cy­cled, says co­founder and chief mar­ket­ing of­fi­cer of In­sectta Chua Kai-Ning, 25.</p>
    <p>“Food waste is a big prob­lem in Sin­ga­pore. In fact, we have one of the high­est per capita rates of food waste in our re­gion. The power of black sol­dier flies is their abil­ity to up­cy­cle food waste by eat­ing it and con­vert­ing it into valu­able bio-ma­te­ri­als,” she adds.</p>
    <p>In­sectta is the first ur­ban in­sect farm in Sin­ga­pore to rear black sol­dier flies to process food waste and turn fly frass into or­ganic food for plants and its lar­vae for an­i­mals.</p>
    <p>The biotech com­pany de­vel­ops high-value, in­sect-de­rived bio­ma­te­ri­als, such as chi­tosan, for both the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and cos­metic in­dus­tries. Re­search by In­sectta found that bio­chem­i­cals ex­tracted from the lar­vae can be used to pro­duce chi­tosan.</p>
    <p>“By har­ness­ing these flies to trans­form or­ganic mat­ter into valu­able re­sources, we have in­creased the value of the food waste – where it once was a negative-value prod­uct – to a pos­i­tive-value prod­uct that is worth a few hun­dred dol­lars a gram,” Ms Chua says.</p>
    <p>The global chi­tosan mar­ket is val­ued at US$7 bil­lion (S$9.34 bil­lion) and is ex­pected to ex­pand by 25 per cent be­tween 2020 and 2030.</p>
    <p>“Chi­tosan is a very po­tent wound-heal­ing agent that can be used in ban­dages, su­tures and an­timi­cro­bial coat­ings. Other than that, it can be used as a mois­turiser for your face. Imag­ine – in­sect-de­rived cos­met­ics. Chi­tosan is also known to be a sup­ple­ment used to lower choles­terol lev­els in the blood,” she adds.</p>
    <p>In­sectta’s re­search and de­vel­op­ment team is work­ing with the Agency for Sci­ence, Tech­nol­ogy and Re­search (A*Star) to yield mul­ti­ple other high-value bio­ma­te­ri­als from the flies.</p>
    <p>Pretty ugly food</p>
    <p>Pro­duce deemed too un­sightly for sale, boxes con­tain­ing ex­cess veg­etable, and bas­kets of over-ripe ba­nanas and pa­paya are des­tined for the bins ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>Co-founder of Ug­lyFood Yeo Pei Shan, 25, found this not only waste­ful but so sad that she had to do some­thing about it.</p>
    <p>To­gether with her friends, she set up her so­cial ini­tia­tive in 2016 to buy, at dis­counts, ed­i­ble pro­duce that would have been thrown away by whole­salers and re­tail­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeo started Ug­lyFood while she was a stu­dent at the Sin­ga­pore</p>
    <p>Univer­sity of Tech­nol­ogy and De­sign (SUTD)</p>
    <p>“We use the blem­ished fruit to pro­duce juices, soy milk­shakes and pop­si­cles. We also re­pur­pose it by cut­ting it up for the acai bowls that we serve in our cafe.”</p>
    <p>Cut­ting up a pear, Ms Yeo shows how the blem­ishes on the skin are not on the flesh in­side, which is white.</p>
    <p>“The blem­ish is only skin deep and does not af­fect the pear, which is still safe to con­sume,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Sur­plus pro­duce tends to be in better con­di­tion and have a higher shelf life, so we re­sell it as fresh pro­duce both at our on­line and in the phys­i­cal store,” she adds.</p>
    <p>The Ug­lyFood cafe and store is lo­cated on the grounds of SUTD.</p>
    <p>Ug­lyFood also asks cus­tomers to do­nate used plas­tic boxes that are still in good con­di­tion and can be used to repack the loose fruit.</p>
    <p>“We may not be plas­tic-free but we try to avoid sin­gle-use plas­tics,” she says.</p>
    <p>Di­gest­ing food waste in just 24 hours</p>
    <p>Sit­ting in the bin cen­tre of the JTC Avi­a­tion 2 @ Sele­tar Aero­space Park is a ma­chine that is con­stantly hun­gry.</p>
    <p>One of the small­est di­gesters in the sta­ble of West­com, a com­pany that de­vel­ops and pro­duces equip­ment and prod­ucts in food waste and other tech­nol­ogy, it can trans­form 50kg of un­con­sumed food into 5kg of or­ganic fer­tiliser in just 24 hours.</p>
    <p>West­com’s largest di­gester can process more than 1,000kg of food waste in the same amount of time.</p>
    <p>The com­pany was set up in 2016 by en­tre­pre­neur David Tan to re­duce and re­cy­cle food waste.</p>
    <p>He im­ported 10 such ma­chines from Ja­pan, only to find that Ja­panese mi­cro or­gan­isms could not ef­fec­tively de­com­pose lo­cal foods such as curry and hot­pot meals, which are higher in oil and salt than Ja­panese food.</p>
    <p>“This cur­rent tech­nol­ogy is code­vel­oped by A*Star and West­com Sin­ga­pore typ­i­cally for lo­cal food waste. The mi­cro or­gan­isms in the ma­chine help to re­cy­cle food waste into odour­less or­ganic fer­tiliser,” says Ms Ruby Fang, 29, vice-pres­i­dent of busi­ness de­vel­op­ment at West­com Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The mi­cro­bial treat­ment breaks down food waste, in­clud­ing bones, dough and even sugar cane safely and ef­fec­tively, help­ing West­com cap­ture a slice of the global food waste processing mar­ket worth an es­ti­mated US$31.7 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>“We col­lect both cooked and un­cooked food waste such as veg­eta­bles, eggshells and rice. The unique ad­van­tage of this tech­nol­ogy is the low op­er­at­ing tem­per­a­ture. We are us­ing about 30 deg C to re­cy­cle food waste, which can save up to 100 per cent of en­ergy,” she adds.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for JTC says the cor­po­ra­tion has tried out sev­eral mod­els of food waste di­gesters since 2016, and fi­nally set­tled on the West Com ver­sion last year, which now pro­duces fer­tiliser that JTC uses in its es­tates.</p>
    <p>Other sites where West­com’s di­gesters are lo­cated in­clude JTC Pan­dan Loop In­dus­trial Es­tate, Jurong-Cle­menti Town Coun­cil, Khoo Teck Puat Hos­pi­tal and One North.</p>
    <p>The di­gesters use the food waste that comes from the can­teens, cafes, hos­pi­tal kitchen, and su­per­mar­ket lo­cated in these ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Grow­ing veg­gies on fish poop</p>
    <p>Nes­tled be­hind a cof­feeshop in Tampines In­dus­trial Park A is a com­mu­nity gar­den “powered” by a high-tech aquapon­ics sys­tem that con­verts fish waste from a tilapia pond into or­ganic nu­tri­ents.</p>
    <p>These nu­tri­ents are used to fat­ten or­ganic veg­eta­bles such as xiao bai cai, kale, cherry toma­toes, win­ter melon, curry leaves and chilli padi.</p>
    <p>“The idea of a com­mu­nity gar­den came about from a group of ten­ants who are pas­sion­ate about gar­den­ing and keen to do some­thing for the com­mu­nity, so I pro­posed one within the in­dus­trial es­tate,” says Ms Cather­ine Koh, 51, pres­i­dent of the Tampines Small and Medium En­ter­prise As­so­ci­a­tion.</p>
    <p>Be­sides us­ing re­cy­cled ma­te­ri­als to build the 185.8 sq m gar­den, JTC also in­tro­duced the group to Metro Farm, a com­mer­cial or­ganic smart farm­ing firm which con­ducts re­search and de­vel­op­ment on smart aquapon­ics farm­ing sys­tems.</p>
    <p>The com­pany spon­sored about $30,000 to build a cus­tom ver­ti­cal smart aquapon­ics farm­ing sys­tem for the group, and trains vol­un­teers on how to plant and har­vest veg­eta­bles us­ing it.</p>
    <p>The sys­tem com­prises a fish tank, a fil­ter sys­tem and an area where the veg­eta­bles grow.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor of Metro Farm Chris Toh, 39, says it is a close-loop, self­sus­tain­ing sys­tem.</p>
    <p>“The waste in the wa­ter goes through the fil­ter and is bro­ken down by ben­e­fi­cial bac­te­ria,” he says.</p>
    <p>“The veg­eta­bles then ab­sorb the nu­tri­ents, pu­ri­fy­ing the wa­ter, which is pumped back to the fish.”</p>
    <p>The sys­tem also uses cam­eras, sen­sors and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence to mon­i­tor and au­to­mate pro­cesses such as ad­just­ments to the lev­els of the PH, tem­per­a­ture and nu­tri­ents.</p>
    <p>Mr Toh ex­plains that the red tilapia was cho­sen be­cause “they have a higher rate of pro­duc­ing waste com­pared to the other breeds of fish”.</p>
    <p>“They are kept in the sys­tem for up to six months – from fin­ger­ling to table size of 600g – be­fore we sell them to restau­rants and zi char stalls,” Mr Toh says.</p>
    <p>Ms Koh says: “The com­mu­nity ben­e­fits from the veg­etable har­vest, which is sold for the up­keep of the sys­tem and to pay for fish food. A por­tion of the pro­ceeds is do­nated to the needy.”</p>
