    <p>An ad­joined re­sale flat in Tiong Bahru with just over 51 years of lease left fetched more than a mil­lion dol­lars this month.</p>
    <p>The unit at Block 43 Moh Guan Ter­race was sold for $1,088,000, Hous­ing Board data showed.</p>
    <p>PropNex real es­tate agent Wong Han Yee, who closed the deal, said the flat is a rare gem be­cause of its size and lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>The unit, which started its lease in 1973, is 131 sq m and listed as a four-room flat. It was cre­ated by join­ing two two-room flats.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong told The New Paper on Sun­day: “It is in a cen­tral lo­ca­tion, be­ing a short walk from Tiong Bahru MRT sta­tion, and will also be a short dis­tance from the up­com­ing Have­lock sta­tion, which will be two stops from Or­chard sta­tion.”</p>
    <p>She added that when the prop­erty was put up for sale in the third quar­ter of last year, there were many in­ter­ested par­ties, most of them with rel­a­tively young fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>The unit is about the size of a jumbo flat, which is not nor­mally found in cen­tral ar­eas but in the heart­land, such as Wood­lands and Yishun. The struc­ture of the flat also al­lows for most of the walls to be knocked down, giv­ing the owner the free­dom to re­con­fig­ure his space.</p>
    <p>“Buyers who look for flats in this area are drawn to its old-world charm. Moh Guan Ter­race has walk-up apart­ments that are not your usual cookie-cut­ter type of flat and have a dis­tinc­tive look,” said Ms Wong.</p>
    <p>She said the mar­ket price for a stan­dard 10-year-old four-room HDB flat in Tiong Bahru is $700,000 to $800,000.</p>
    <p>Ms Christine Sun, head of re­search and con­sul­tancy at OrangeTee & Tie, said the unit could fetch such a high price be­cause of its rare size in a prime lo­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>She said: “Some may not mind pay­ing the amount to en­joy the lo­ca­tion and space, which oth­er­wise will be very ex­pen­sive if it is a pri­vate con­do­minium.”</p>
    <p>While his­tor­i­cal value may play a role, she said the flat’s ten­ure, size and lo­ca­tion are more im­por­tant fac­tors af­fect­ing the buyer’s de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Ms Wong said that while the unit has a short lease of slightly over 51 years that could make it dif­fi­cult to re­sell, there is high de­mand for flats in the Tiong Bahru area.</p>
    <p>“I think there will be con­tin­ued de­mand for prop­er­ties in this area, as the charm of the area is unique. The area is also highly live­able and has seen high rental de­mand,” she said.</p>
    <p>Long-time Tiong Bahru res­i­dents who spoke to TNP said their fam­i­lies are un­likely to sell their homes de­spite know­ing that they could pos­si­bly fetch a high price, given the pop­u­lar­ity of the area.</p>
    <p>Miss Lim Zhimin, 25, who lives in Jalan Klinik, said the lo­ca­tion and sur­round­ing ameni­ties are a great draw. She added that the re­sale price of the Moh Guan Ter­race flat did not sur­prise her.</p>
    <p>“It is right where the Tiong Bahru her­itage area is and, cul­tur­ally speak­ing, it is a lot richer com­pared with the rest of the precinct.”</p>
    <p>In April last year, a 112 sq m five­room flat at Block 9A Boon Tiong Road was resold for a record $1.2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The price pipped the pre­vi­ous record of $1.185 mil­lion set by a 237 sq m HDB ter­race house in Jalan Ba­ha­gia sold in Septem­ber 2018 as well as a five-room flat at City View @ Boon Keng in Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>The record has since been bro­ken by at least two transactio­ns – a five­room flat at Pin­na­cle @ Dux­ton that was sold for $1.232 mil­lion in March this year and a five-room unit at City View @ Boon Keng that went for $1.205 mil­lion in July last year.</p>
