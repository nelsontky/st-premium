    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia aims to file 30 charges against glove maker Bright­way Hold­ings and two of its sub­sidiaries, after raids that found their work­ers’ ac­com­mo­da­tion was not up to le­gal stan­dards.</p>
    <p>The Labour Depart­ment, part of the Min­istry of Hu­man Re­sources, last week con­ducted a raid on one of the com­pany’s glove-mak­ing fac­to­ries in Ka­jang district, just out­side Kuala Lumpur, and found work­ers liv­ing in cramped, dirty ship­ping con­tain­ers stacked be­hind the premises.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said in a state­ment late on Sun­day it had found “fa­cil­i­ties that do not meet the min­i­mum stan­dard spec­i­fi­ca­tions” and that the em­ployer did not have a proper cer­tifi­cate of ac­com­mo­da­tion. Bright­way did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The min­istry said it was in the process of com­plet­ing in­ves­ti­ga­tion pa­pers against Bright­way and its sub­sidiaries Bio­pro and La Glove.</p>
    <p>Malaysia is the world’s top pro­ducer of rub­ber gloves and its fac­to­ries have been par­tic­u­larly busy meet­ing or­ders since the coro­n­avirus pan­demic be­gan.</p>
    <p>The charges come as Malaysia steps up scru­tiny of work­ers’ ac­com­mo­da­tion at glove man­u­fac­tur­ing firms after a Covid-19 out­break at Top Glove Corp, the world’s big­gest maker of med­i­cal gloves.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment said this month it would file charges against Top Glove be­cause of poor work­ers’ ac­com­mo­da­tion, which it found to be cramped and poorly ven­ti­lated.</p>
    <p>Malaysia has seen a spike in coro­n­avirus cases since Septem­ber, with more than 105,000 cases and 452 Covid-19 deaths re­ported. Last Satur­day, the coun­try logged a record high num­ber of daily cases since the start of the pan­demic, with 2,335 in­fec­tions.</p>
