    <p>Friends star Matthew Perry, 51, has an­nounced he is set to tie the knot with his 29-year-old girl­friend Molly Hur­witz.</p>
    <p>He con­firmed the news when he spoke to Peo­ple mag­a­zine on Thurs­day.</p>
    <p>“I de­cided to get en­gaged. Luck­ily, I hap­pened to be dat­ing the great­est woman on the face of the planet at this time,” said the ac­tor, who has been with Hur­witz since 2018.</p>
    <p>Hur­witz, who works as a lit­er­ary man­ager, has posted about her re­la­tion­ship with Perry on her pri­vate In­sta­gram ac­count, in­clud­ing a sweet trib­ute to him on Valen­tine’s Day this year, around the time he joined the so­cial me­dia plat­form and amassed more than four mil­lion fol­low­ers in 24 hours.</p>
    <p>She wrote: “Sec­ond year be­ing my valen­tine, but his first as an In­sta­gram in­flu­encer.”</p>
    <p>Perry and his co-stars Jennifer Anis­ton, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Sch­wim­mer from Friends – a sit­com which ran from 1994 to 2004</p>
    <p>– have a re­union show in the works. How­ever, film­ing has been de­layed be­cause of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this month, he tweeted: “Friends re­union be­ing resched­uled for the be­gin­ning of March. Looks like we have a busy year com­ing up. And that’s the way I like it.”</p>
    <p>Va­ri­ety re­ported that the six Friends stars will each re­ceive at least US$2.5 mil­lion (S$3.35 mil­lion) for tak­ing part in the one-off spe­cial.</p>
