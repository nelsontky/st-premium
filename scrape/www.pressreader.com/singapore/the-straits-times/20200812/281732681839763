    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Global coro­n­avirus cases pushed past 20 mil­lion on Mon­day, with the US, Brazil and In­dia ac­count­ing for more than half of all known in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>The res­pi­ra­tory disease has in­fected at least four times the av­er­age num­ber of peo­ple struck down with se­vere in­fluenza ill­nesses an­nu­ally, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WHO).</p>
    <p>The death toll from Covid-19, at more than 740,000, has out­paced the up­per range of an­nual deaths from the flu.</p>
    <p>The tally, which is based on gov­ern­ment re­ports, shows the spread of the disease is ac­cel­er­at­ing.</p>
    <p>It took al­most six months to reach 10 mil­lion cases af­ter the first in­fec­tion was re­ported in Wuhan, China, in early Jan­uary, but just 43 days for the tally to dou­ble to 20 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts be­lieve the of­fi­cial data likely un­der­counts both in­fec­tions and deaths, par­tic­u­larly in coun­tries with lim­ited test­ing ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The United States is re­spon­si­ble for around five mil­lion cases, Brazil three mil­lion and In­dia two mil­lion. Rus­sia and South Africa round out the top five.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is ac­cel­er­at­ing fastest in Latin Amer­ica, which ac­counts for al­most 28 per cent of the world’s cases and more than 30 per cent of deaths.</p>
    <p>With the first wave of the virus yet to peak in some coun­tries and a resur­gence of cases in oth­ers, gov­ern­ments are still di­vided in their re­sponses to com­bat the spread of the coro­n­avirus. Some coun­tries are rein­tro­duc­ing strict public health mea­sures, while oth­ers con­tinue to re­lax re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Health ex­perts ex­pect dilem­mas about how to pro­ceed with school, work and so­cial life to last – and re­stric­tions to fluc­tu­ate – un­til a vac­cine is avail­able.</p>
    <p>There are more than 150 vac­cine can­di­dates be­ing de­vel­oped and tested around the world, with 25 in hu­man clin­i­cal tri­als, ac­cord­ing to the WHO.</p>
    <p>Rus­sian Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin yes­ter­day an­nounced that his coun­try had be­come the first in the world to grant reg­u­la­tory ap­proval to a Covid-19 vac­cine af­ter less than two months of hu­man test­ing.</p>
    <p>The WHO and the Rus­sian health au­thor­i­ties are dis­cussing the process for pos­si­ble WHO pre-qual­i­fi­ca­tion for the newly ap­proved vac­cine, a WHO spokesman said.</p>
    <p>In the US, chil­dren be­gan re­turn­ing to their class­rooms last week, even as con­tro­versy over school safety swirled.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has added both Spain and Bel­gium to a list of coun­tries from which re­turn­ing trav­ellers must quar­an­tine at home for 14 days be­cause of fresh upticks in some Euro­pean lo­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>In Asia, China con­tin­ues to quash surges us­ing strict, lo­cal lock­downs, bring­ing its daily num­bers down into the low dou­ble dig­its on the main­land. Hong Kong yes­ter­day re­ported the fewest new cases since its lat­est out­break be­gan about a month ago.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has in­tro­duced a strict lock­down and night cur­few in the city of Mel­bourne, aim­ing to sti­fle an out­break there.</p>
    <p>In neigh­bour­ing New Zealand, where life had largely re­turned to nor­mal af­ter 102 days with no new lo­cal trans­mis­sions, the largest city of Auck­land was shut down yes­ter­day af­ter new com­mu­nity cases were dis­cov­ered.</p>
