    <p>Re­searchers at the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s (NTU) Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine have come up with a way to tell if a per­son has Covid-19 or dengue in just 36 min­utes. This is just one quar­ter of the time taken by cur­rent test­ing meth­ods for the same dis­eases, NTU said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Re­searchers at the Nanyang Tech­no­log­i­cal Univer­sity’s (NTU) Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine have come up with a way to tell if a per­son has Covid-19 or dengue in just 36 min­utes.</p>
    <p>This is just a quar­ter of the time taken by cur­rent test­ing meth­ods for the same dis­eases, NTU said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>At the moment, the most sen­si­tive way to de­tect Covid-19 is through a poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tech­nique in a lab­o­ra­tory, which uses a ma­chine to “am­plify” vi­ral ge­netic ma­te­rial by copy­ing it over and over again so any trace of the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, can be de­tected.</p>
    <p>But while such a method is ac­cu­rate, it can take a few hours to com­plete, par­tially due to a step known as RNA pu­rifi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>When a pa­tient is swab tested, his RNA needs to be ex­tracted from the swab sam­ple to re­move any sub­stances in the sam­ple that in­hibit the PCR test from work­ing, such as mucin – a main com­po­nent of mu­cus.</p>
    <p>It also re­quires chem­i­cals that are now in short sup­ply world­wide, and needs to be car­ried out by highly trained staff us­ing ex­pen­sive equip­ment.</p>
    <p>But the NTU team’s method, known as “di­rect-PCR”, uses a se­ries of com­mer­cially avail­able en­zymes and reagents that are re­sis­tant to in­hibitor sub­stances to over­come this ob­sta­cle.</p>
    <p>By mix­ing them to­gether with pa­tient swab sam­ples in a test tube, the team is able to skip the RNA pu­rifi­ca­tion step and per­form the test on the sam­ple di­rectly, pro­duc­ing ac­cu­rate re­sults in a shorter time.</p>
    <p>Dr Sivalingam Paramaling­am Suppiah, a se­nior re­search fel­low who is part of the team, said: “By skip­ping the RNA ex­trac­tion step with our di­rect-PCR method, we see cost sav­ings... and avoid the prob­lem of reagents in short sup­ply when lab test­ing is ramped up and the de­mand in­creases glob­ally.”</p>
    <p>The team’s method can also be de­ployed out­side of a lab­o­ra­tory us­ing a ma­chine known as a por­ta­ble ther­mo­cy­cler.</p>
    <p>This means there is a pos­si­bil­ity that its test­ing method can be used in com­mu­nity health­care set­tings by front-line health­care work­ers, rather than need­ing to send the re­sults to a lab­o­ra­tory and wait for them to be pro­cessed there.</p>
    <p>The team’s leader, As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Eric Yap, noted that fur­ther stud­ies need to be done to see how ef­fec­tive the test method is in a real-world set­ting.</p>
    <p>By skip­ping the RNA ex­trac­tion step with our di­rect-PCR method, we see cost sav­ings... and avoid the prob­lem of reagents in short sup­ply when lab test­ing is ramped up and the de­mand in­creases glob­ally. ’’</p>
    <p>DR SIVALINGAM PARAMALING­AM SUPPIAH, se­nior re­search fel­low.</p>
    <p>“When one bot­tle­neck is re­moved, other chal­lenges may emerge, like en­sur­ing qual­ity con­trol or re­duc­ing man­ual er­rors,” he said.</p>
    <p>They are cur­rently aim­ing to use the method in Covid-19 test­ing at the NTU Clin­i­cal Di­ag­nos­tic Lab­o­ra­tory.</p>
    <p>Prof Yap said that the team’s method works on the dengue virus as well, pro­duc­ing re­sults in just 28 min­utes. “As Sin­ga­pore bat­tles the dual out­break of dengue and Covid-19, both with sim­i­lar early symp­toms, our test could help in dif­fer­en­ti­at­ing be­tween the two in­fec­tious dis­eases,” he said.</p>
    <p>He added: “Our goal is to develop ul­tra­fast and au­to­mated tests that yield re­sults in min­utes, and that can be per­formed by health­care work­ers in the clinic with sim­i­lar ac­cu­racy and sen­si­tiv­ity as in spe­cialised lab­o­ra­to­ries.</p>
    <p>“This will al­low us to take PCR test­ing out of con­ven­tional lab­o­ra­to­ries nearer to the point of care, and into the low-re­source set­tings that need them the most.”</p>
