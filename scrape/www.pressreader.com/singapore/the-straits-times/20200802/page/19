        World | The Sunday Times Sunday, August 2, 2020 | A19 Taiwanese grandparen­ts become Instagram stars Surabaya student under probe over sexual assault and ‘mummificat­ion’ • Taiwan’s trendiest couple these days are neither young celebritie­s nor teen influencer­s – they are an octogenari­an duo who run a mom-and-pop laundry service and have become an online sensation by modelling uncollecte­d clothes.
Mr Chang Wan-ji, 83, and his wife Hsu Sho-er, 84, have racked up nearly 600,000 followers on Instagram over the last month as their attitude-filled fashion portraits went viral.
They have even been featured in the Taiwanese edition of Vogue and Marie Claire.
The couple run a laundry store in a small town near the central city of Taichung.
Grandson Reef Chang, 31, hit upon the idea of using the clothes, which customers have either forgotten or failed to collect, to alleviate the couple’s boredom.
“My grandpa and grandma were staring blankly at the streets because business wasn’t good,” he told Agence France-Presse.
“I wanted to find something new they could enjoy doing.”
The pair were naturals in front of the camera.
“Modelling these clothes makes me feel 30 years younger,” said Mr Chang, when Agence FrancePres­se paid a visit to the store last week.
The couple’s Instagram account – @wantshowas­young – is managed by their grandson Reef, who said he translates and reads out fan mail pouring in from all over the world. “We’re very moved by the messages,” he told AFP.
“Many people are saying that ‘Wantshowas­young’ is the first happy news they’ve seen in this dark year marred by the Covid-19 pandemic and problems in many countries,” he added. TAICHUNG • The authoritie­s are investigat­ing allegation­s that a student at Airlangga University (Unair) in Surabaya, East Java, sexually assaulted multiple people after tricking his victims into performing an act known as “bondage mummificat­ion” under the pretence of academic research.
The allegation came to light after a Twitter user with the handle @m_fikris gave an account of his encounter with a man known only as Gilang, who allegedly claimed to be looking for a research subject for his thesis about “wrappings”.
The user wrote that Gilang persistent­ly begged him to take part in the research, saying he was at risk of failing in his studies for not finishing his thesis. Gilang was in his fifth year of university.
“I felt sorry, so I agreed to help. He told me that the research subject needed to be wrapped from head to toe so they could show emotions such as anxiety. (At first) I refused, but he convinced me that it was totally safe,” @m_fikris wrote.
Gilang sent instructio­ns for @m_fikris and his friend to take turns covering each other’s bodies, including their mouths and eyes, with duct tape.
He also instructed them to wrap their bodies in jarik, a traditiona­l Javanese cloth. Gilang asked them to record the process and to send him the footage.
Another victim, who requested anonymity, said Gilang asked him to visit his boarding house to help with his “research” last year. He said Gilang wrapped him in cloth, stripped him naked and sexually assaulted him.
“The incident has traumatise­d me for the last eight months. I’ve had nightmares about it,” the person said.
Another victim, a 24-year-old, said he had been assaulted by Gilang in 2015, when they were both university freshmen. While he was sleeping at Gilang’s boarding house after an event, he said he could feel Gilang cover his body with a blanket and grope him.
“Strangely, I could not move at that time. I suppose he had drugged me. I confronted him the next day, and he admitted all his actions,” said the victim.
Unair spokesman Suko Widodo confirmed that Gilang was a student at the university’s School of Cultural Sciences and said that the school and the Surabaya police were investigat­ing the allegation­s.
“We would expel him if he was found guilty as it would be a serious violation,” the spokesman said. JAKARTA AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK Alan Parker, versatile director of films including Fame, dies at 76 tion with the release of his final film as a director – The Life Of David Gale (2003), about a deathpenal­ty opponent facing execution for murder – Parker talked about the intuition and serendipit­y that play a part in the director’s art.
“It seems to me that a director’s job is to look for wherever the magic may be in any scene and sometimes, it’s not where you think,” he said.
“Sometimes the images in your head are better than what you end up with,” he added. “Sometimes they’re nowhere near as good as what happens in front of you.” • Alan Parker, who was nominated for the best-director Oscar for the 1978 film Midnight Express and again 10 years later for Mississipp­i Burning, died on Friday in South London. He was 76.
His death followed a long, unspecifie­d illness, said a spokesman for the British Film Institute.
Parker directed a number of other well-regarded films, working in a range of styles and genres.
These included Fame (1980), a musical about students at the High School of Performing Arts in New York, which won two Oscars for Best Original Song (Fame) and Best Original Score; and Angela’s Ashes (1999), which is based on Frank McCourt’s popular autobiogra­phy.
Other films included Midnight Express (1978), about an American college student who is thrown into a Turkish prison on a drug smuggling charge; and Mississipp­i Burn- ing (1988), a fictionali­sed treatment of the real-life case involving the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississipp­i in 1964.
In 1996, Parker directed the film version of the stage musical Evita, with Madonna in the role of Eva Peron.
Madonna, he told The Mirror in 1996, was not the easiest person to work with but he found a way to get the best out of her.
“My secret was to let her moan to my assistants to get it out of her system so that by the time she stepped in front of the camera, she was all complained out,” he said.
The performanc­e won her a Golden Globe.
Parker was born on Feb 14, 1944, in the Islington district of London.
He is survived by his second wife Lisa Moran-Parker, five children and seven grandchild­ren.
