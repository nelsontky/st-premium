    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo’s state­ment on July 13 is not a rad­i­cal de­par­ture from the United States’ ex­ist­ing South China Sea pol­icy but rather an evo­lu­tion­ary step in its har­den­ing stance to­wards the dis­putes.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, the state­ment will lead to a fur­ther de­te­ri­o­ra­tion in US-China re­la­tions and has im­por­tant im­pli­ca­tions for the South-east Asian claimants.</p>
    <p>US pol­icy on the South China Sea has been con­sis­tent for 25 years. In 1995, following China’s oc­cu­pa­tion of Philip­pine-claimed Mis­chief Reef, the US is­sued a state­ment that de­clared Amer­ica’s fun­da­men­tal in­ter­est in free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion in the South China Sea and called for a peace­ful res­o­lu­tion of the dis­pute in ac­cor­dance with in­ter­na­tional law.</p>
    <p>While the US de­clined to take a po­si­tion on com­pet­ing sovereignt­y claims, it did ex­press se­ri­ous con­cern over mar­itime claims or ac­tions that were in­con­sis­tent with the 1982 United Na­tions Con­ven­tion on the Law of the Sea (Unclos).</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the 2000s, as China be­came more as­sertive in the South China Sea, US of­fi­cials be­came more crit­i­cal of Bei­jing’s co­er­cive ac­tions and the le­gal am­bi­gu­ity of its claims as rep­re­sented by the “nine-dash line”, which cov­ers 80 per cent of the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>But when the ar­bi­tral tri­bunal is­sued its his­toric award on July 12, 2016, the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion merely called on China and the Philip­pines to abide by the rul­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, the US has adopted a more hard-nosed pol­icy to­wards China over a range of is­sues, in­clud­ing on the South China Sea. Wash­ing­ton has ac­cused China of mil­i­taris­ing the South China Sea, bul­ly­ing South-east Asian claimants and un­der­min­ing free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion. In re­sponse, the US dis­in­vited the Chi­nese navy from mul­ti­lat­eral US-led naval ex­er­cises, strength­ened de­fence co­op­er­a­tion with South-east Asian coun­tries and in­creased the fre­quency of free­dom of nav­i­ga­tion op­er­a­tions (Fonops), which are de­signed to chal­lenge ex­ces­sive mar­itime claims in the Paracels and Spratlys.</p>
    <p>Mr Pom­peo’s state­ment co­in­cided with the fourth an­niver­sary of the ar­bi­tra­tion rul­ing and serves two main pur­poses.</p>
    <p>First, it is an ex­pres­sion of Wash­ing­ton’s in­creas­ing anger with Bei­jing over its be­hav­iour in the South China Sea over the past few months. The US has ac­cused China of tak­ing ad­van­tage of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic to double down on its claims by cre­at­ing two new ad­min­is­tra­tive dis­tricts to cover the dis­puted is­lands, harass­ing Viet­namese fish­ing boats and a Malaysian-char­tered drilling rig, and con­duct­ing a se­ries of high-pro­file naval ex­er­cises.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, it seeks to re­as­sure South-east Asian coun­tries of Amer­ica’s com­mit­ment to re­gional se­cu­rity and re­spond to concerns that US in­ter­ests are pri­mar­ily fo­cused on safe­guard­ing nav­i­ga­tional free­doms for its own war­ships rather than pro­mot­ing the sov­er­eign rights of claimant coun­tries to fish­eries and en­ergy re­sources in their ex­clu­sive eco­nomic zones (EEZs).</p>
    <p>WHAT’S NEXT FOR THE US?</p>
    <p>Over the com­ing months, the US is likely to in­crease the pace of its Fonops and other pres­ence mis­sions in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Both be­fore and af­ter the state­ment, the US Navy sent two air­craft car­ri­ers through the area, and the day af­ter con­ducted its 23rd Fonop in the area since Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump took of­fice (only four took place dur­ing the en­tire Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion). The US will also step up its se­cu­rity as­sis­tance to the South-east Asian claimants, pro­vid­ing them with radars and other equip­ment to better mon­i­tor their EEZs.</p>
    <p>By declar­ing China’s ac­tions il­le­gal, Wash­ing­ton has opened the door to im­pos­ing sanc­tions against Chi­nese cit­i­zens and cor­po­rate en­ti­ties that im­ple­ment Bei­jing’s pol­icy in the South China Sea. The day af­ter Mr Pom­peo’s state­ment, US As­sis­tant Sec­re­tary of State for East Asian and Pa­cific Af­fairs</p>
    <p>David Stil­well raised this pos­si­bil­ity in a speech to a US think-tank. The US Congress would likely sup­port such a move as it has done over Hong Kong, Xin­jiang and Ti­bet.</p>
    <p>At a press con­fer­ence on July 15, Mr Pom­peo promised that the US would pro­vide diplo­matic and le­gal sup­port to coun­tries whose mar­itime rights have been vi­o­lated by China. That leaves open the ques­tion on whether and how far Wash­ing­ton is will­ing to lend its sup­port by mil­i­tary means. It is un­likely that the US would as­sign war­ships to pro­tect South-east Asian fish­ing boats, sur­vey ves­sels and drilling plat­forms as this would be ex­pen­sive and in­crease the risk of a mil­i­tary con­fronta­tion with Chi­nese govern­ment ves­sels.</p>
    <p>BE­TWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE</p>
    <p>Most lit­toral South-east Asian states in the South China Sea qui­etly wel­comed Mr Pom­peo’s state­ment, but this will not nec­es­sar­ily trans­late into a ro­bust, united Asean push­back against China’s ex­ces­sive mar­itime claims and en­croach­ments.</p>
    <p>Much has been made about the un­prece­dented lan­guage of the 36th Asean Sum­mit last month, which stated that Unclos was the “ba­sis for de­ter­min­ing mar­itime en­ti­tle­ments, sov­er­eign rights, ju­ris­dic­tion and le­git­i­mate in­ter­ests over mar­itime zones”. This new lan­guage adds fur­ther clar­ity and speci­ficity that would lend cre­dence to Asean’s gen­eral ref­er­ence to “up­hold­ing in­ter­na­tional law, in­clud­ing Unclos”. How­ever, the text fell within the pre­rog­a­tive of Viet­nam, this year’s Asean chair­man, and did not re­quire the con­sen­sus of all the mem­ber states.</p>
    <p>For sus­tained sig­nif­i­cance, the lan­guage must be em­bed­ded in Asean’s future canon texts.</p>
    <p>While a strong and co­he­sive Asean po­si­tion re­mains elu­sive, key lit­toral states – In­done­sia, Malaysia, the Philip­pines and Viet­nam – are not likely to squan­der this op­por­tu­nity to bol­ster their le­gal po­si­tions re­gard­ing the dis­pute.</p>
    <p>Even prior to Mr Pom­peo’s state­ment, these coun­tries and the US had em­pha­sised the ar­bi­tral tri­bunal’s find­ings to re­ject China’s claims, as demon­strated in their re­cent ex­change of notes ver­bales to the UN Sec­re­tary-Gen­eral. For some time, they have lamented that the US should be do­ing more.</p>
    <p>Now, the ball is in their court to push this mo­men­tum for­ward to their ben­e­fit while tread­ing care­fully so as not to anger China.</p>
    <p>Im­me­di­ate re­sponses from some re­gional states in­di­cate that while they are care­ful not to be seen sid­ing with the US, they are es­sen­tially on the same page.</p>
    <p>On July 16, Malaysia af­firmed that mat­ters re­lat­ing to the South China Sea must “be re­solved peace­fully based on the uni­ver­sally recog­nised prin­ci­ples of in­ter­na­tional law, in­clud­ing Unclos”. Viet­nam went fur­ther to im­plic­itly en­dorse the US state­ment by wel­com­ing “coun­tries’ po­si­tions on the East Sea is­sues which are con­sis­tent with in­ter­na­tional law”. (East Sea is how Hanoi refers to the South China Sea). Mean­while, the Philip­pines, in its first ever state­ment on the an­niver­sary of the is­suance of the award, re­it­er­ated that it “is a mile­stone in the cor­pus of in­ter­na­tional law, the cor­ner­stone of a rules-based re­gional and in­ter­na­tional or­der”.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Mr Pom­peo’s state­ment, Philip­pine De­fence Sec­re­tary Delfin Loren­zana called on China to im­ple­ment the tri­bunal’s award.</p>
    <p>Al­though these state­ments are not com­pletely sim­i­lar, one can dis­cern a shared mes­sage that these coun­tries will per­sist with the re­course to in­ter­na­tional law, es­pe­cially Unclos, to de­fend their mar­itime ju­ris­dic­tional rights. If any­thing, Mr Pom­peo’s state­ment will em­bolden their de­ter­mi­na­tion and confidence in mak­ing sure that Unclos, as in­ter­preted by the ar­bi­tra­tion rul­ing, would form a le­gal ba­sis for the on­go­ing ne­go­ti­a­tions with China on a Code of Con­duct (COC) for the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>How­ever, when it comes to the more ro­bust US mil­i­tary pres­ence in the South China Sea, South-east Asian re­sponses would be more di­vided. Some qui­etly wel­come it while oth­ers like Malaysia may not, at least of­fi­cially. For its part, China con­tin­ues to por­tray the US as med­dling in the dis­pute and projects it­self as be­ing in lock­step with Asean through the COC process. Given China’s per­sis­tent en­croach­ments into the mar­itime zones of In­done­sia, Malaysia, the Philip­pines and Viet­nam over the past year, this nar­ra­tive does not find any tak­ers in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>In the im­me­di­ate af­ter­math of the Pom­peo state­ment, Bei­jing stepped up pres­sure on sev­eral Asean coun­tries to keep them from en­dors­ing the US state­ment. For ex­am­ple, For­eign Min­is­ter Wang Yi ad­vised his Philip­pine coun­ter­part to “cher­ish” their im­proved re­la­tions since 2016, while Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping told Singapore Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong that the two coun­tries should work to­gether to “over­come dis­trac­tions” to safe­guard peace and sta­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The onus is now on South-east Asian coun­tries to make a clear and prin­ci­pled po­si­tion to Bei­jing that in tak­ing the side of in­ter­na­tional law, they are not act­ing at the be­hest of Wash­ing­ton but are pro­tect­ing their le­git­i­mate sov­er­eign rights and mar­itime en­ti­tle­ments.</p>
