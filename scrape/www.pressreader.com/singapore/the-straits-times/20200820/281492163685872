    <p>Net­flix view­ers can ex­pect more made-in-In­dia ti­tles as the stream­ing ser­vice ramps up its in­vest­ment in shows from the na­tion.</p>
    <p>In the com­ing months, 17 films and tele­vi­sion se­ries will be re­leased, run­ning the gamut from ro­mance and drama to come­dies and thrillers.</p>
    <p>In an e-mail, Ms Monika Shergill, vice-pres­i­dent of con­tent at Net­flix In­dia, tells The Straits Times the slate is “well-bal­anced”.</p>
    <p>“It gives al­most equal rep­re­sen­ta­tion to male and fe­male writ­ers, di­rec­tors, pro­duc­ers and ac­tors. These sto­ries from In­dia’s finest cre­ators rep­re­sent the tremen­dous di­ver­sity that In­dian sto­ry­telling holds for the world,” she says.</p>
    <p>One film, re­leased last week, is the biopic Gun­jan Saxena: The Kargil Girl (PG13, 112 min­utes). The story of In­dia’s first fe­male air force of­fi­cer to fly in com­bat is now among the top 10 most-watched films on Net­flix Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Sha­ran Sharma says in a sep­a­rate e-mail interview that shoot­ing the aerial scenes – mostly in the east­ern Euro­pean coun­try of Georgia – was a “sur­real” ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>The pro­duc­tion team was “clear from the start” that real air­craft would be used as much as pos­si­ble in­stead of re­ly­ing on com­puter ef­fects.</p>
    <p>“The aerial ac­tion was def­i­nitely a ma­jor chal­lenge, as it needed a very spe­cific kind of ex­per­tise.</p>
    <p>“How­ever, it was also the most thrilling part of the shoot,” says the di­rec­tor, who makes his fea­ture de­but with the film.</p>
    <p>The fly­ing scenes de­pict he­li­copter pi­lot Gun­jan Saxena – played by young ac­tress Jan­hvi Kapoor – in train­ing as well as in ac­tion dur­ing the 1999 Kargil War, an armed con­flict be­tween In­dia and Pak­istan.</p>
    <p>“It was al­most sur­real for me, my di­rec­tor of pho­tog­ra­phy and Jan­hvi to be up in the air, film­ing for six days. We were glad we stuck to that de­ci­sion. It was a lot more chal­leng­ing and prob­a­bly more ex­pen­sive, but I feel it was worth it,” Sharma says.</p>
    <p>The story de­picts Saxena’s strug­gle against the prej­u­dices of the 1990s. Of­fi­cially, the walls stop­ping women from be­com­ing pi­lots had come down, but un­of­fi­cially, male pi­lots cre­ated new ob­sta­cles.</p>
    <p>View­ing women as en­e­mies of cher­ished mas­cu­line tra­di­tions, the men set women pi­lots up to fail, such as by fail­ing to build chang­ing rooms for them and as­sign­ing flight du­ties to only men.</p>
    <p>“The film is a re­flec­tion of Saxena’s jour­ney and the kind of mind­sets she had to tackle. It is a re­flec­tion of the world we lived in and con­tinue to live in. In 2020, it feels like a lot has changed, but there still is a long way to go,” Sharma says.</p>
    <p>Also mak­ing his fea­ture film de­but is di­rec­tor Honey Tre­han, whose crime thriller Raat Akeli Hai (NC16, 149 min­utes) was re­leased on July 31. Through the eyes of po­lice­man Ya­dav, played by Nawazud­din Sid­diqui, the norms of life out­side In­dia’s ma­jor cities are ex­posed.</p>
    <p>The screen­play, writ­ten by Smita Singh, shows how “cul­ture in a lot of small towns is still steeped in a feu­dal­is­tic men­tal­ity”, says Tre­han via e-mail.</p>
    <p>Ya­dav’s at­tempt at track­ing down a mur­derer is com­pli­cated by the in­volve­ment of a pow­er­ful fam­ily who is linked to the traf­fick­ing of women. The cop is re­peat­edly re­minded of his place in the lo­cal peck­ing or­der, one de­fined not just by fam­ily con­nec­tions, but also by caste.</p>
    <p>“The dark­ness is al­ways hid­den deep within, where every­one knows it ex­ists, but no­body talks about it,” he says.</p>
    <p>Com­ing to Net­flix Sin­ga­pore to­mor­row is the crime thriller Class Of ’83 (NC16, 98 min­utes).</p>
    <p>Set in the 1980s, it stars Bobby Deol as Vi­jay Singh, the tough but mys­te­ri­ous dean of the po­lice acad­emy in Bom­bay (now Mumbai). He re­cruits a group of cadets and shapes them into a se­cret vig­i­lante team, em­bed­ded with the po­lice but act­ing out­side the law.</p>
    <p>Di­rec­tor Atul Sab­har­wal says the film, loosely based on a non-fic­tion book by S. Hus­sain Zaidi, seeks to cap­ture the spirit of a tur­bu­lent pe­riod.</p>
    <p>He says in an e-mail: “1980s In­dia holds a spe­cial in­ter­est for my gen­er­a­tion. It was event­ful, and not al­ways in the best pos­si­ble ways.”</p>
    <p>It was a time of in­creased mil­i­tancy and po­lit­i­cal as­sas­si­na­tions, and closed mar­kets made smug­gling a lu­cra­tive busi­ness. Any­one seek­ing to open a busi­ness had to ob­tain a be­wil­der­ing ar­ray of per­mits is­sued by bu­reau­cracy dubbed the “Li­cence Raj”.</p>
    <p>“Cor­rup­tion was ram­pant in govern­ment de­part­ments be­cause of the Li­cence Raj,” Sab­har­wal says.</p>
    <p>The story, which deals with the use of mur­der to clean up the streets, is not based on any sin­gle case.</p>
    <p>“Zaidi, writer of the book, was present as a re­search con­sul­tant and al­ways help­ful with anec­dotes and facts,” Sab­har­wal says.</p>
    <p>“The film uses fic­tional archetypes, in sit­u­a­tions in­spired by real events all over the coun­try, not just from Bom­bay of the 1980s.”</p>
    <p>Here are some up­com­ing made-in-In­dia works on Net­flix. Re­lease dates are to be con­firmed.</p>
    <p>A SUIT­ABLE BOY</p>
    <p>Di­rected by the Os­car- and Golden Globe-nom­i­nated Mira Nair (for the 1988 crime drama Salaam Bom­bay!), this four-episode minis­eries is pro­duced by BBC One and dis­trib­uted by Net­flix in this re­gion.</p>
    <p>It is adapted from Vikram Seth’s cel­e­brated 1993 novel of the same name. Screen­writer An­drew Davies (ro­man­tic com­edy Brid­get Jones’s Diary, 2001, and its se­quel Brid­get Jones: The Edge Of Rea­son, 2004) tells the story of col­lege stu­dent Lata (Tanya Manik­tala, above, left, with Mahira Kakkar) and her friends and fam­ily in 1950s In­dia as they as­pire to love and sta­bil­ity in a chang­ing coun­try.</p>
    <p>LUDO</p>
    <p>This com­edy-drama, which stars Fa­tima Sana Shaikh and Ra­jkum­mar Rao (both above), is about four peo­ple whose lives in­ter­twine in un­ex­pected ways. Called a “dark com­edy an­thol­ogy” by some news sites, it is helmed by re­al­ity show judge and film-maker Anurag Basu.</p>
    <p>AK VS AK</p>
    <p>This drama stars two of In­dia’s big­gest male leads, Anurag Kashyap (above, left) and Anil Kapoor (above, right), who play ver­sions of them­selves. In this film-within-a-film mind-twis­ter, Kashyap is a film di­rec­tor who kid­naps Kapoor’s daugh­ter and films the ac­tor’s des­per­ate search in real time in the hope of creat­ing a hit.</p>
    <p>BOM­BAY ROSE</p>
    <p>In­dian an­i­ma­tion is not well-known in this part of the world, but this film, se­lected to open In­ter­na­tional Crit­ics’ Week at the 2019 Venice Film Fes­ti­val, might make the for­mat more pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>It tells three tales of ro­mance, each in­ter­rupted by the re­al­i­ties of com­mu­nal fric­tion and re­li­gious tra­di­tion that rule Bom­bay.</p>
    <p>Writ­ten, de­signed and di­rected by ac­tress and film-maker Gi­tan­jali Rao, the film takes its tra­di­tional look from the use of hand-drawn com­puter art, cre­ated by 60 artists over 18 months.</p>
