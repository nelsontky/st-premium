    <p>Cor­ner­stone Com­mu­nity Church is now a phys­i­cal and dig­i­tal hy­brid that reaches an au­di­ence in Sin­ga­pore and be­yond.</p>
    <p>The 5,000-strong church streams week­end ser­vices for its stay-home con­gre­ga­tion. This month, it also joined the na­tion in the phase two re­open­ing, with groups of 50 re­gath­er­ing at its Ka­tong and Bugis premises, the pas­tors preach­ing be­hind face shields.</p>
    <p>On a visit to the Ka­tong au­di­to­rium on July 11, chairs were spaced more than the manda­tory me­tre apart i n t he once-packed hall where 950 peo­ple would sing to con­tem­po­rary mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Now, 50 peo­ple wor­shipped silently, while a re­mote wor­ship team, frag­mented into Zoom rec­tan­gles, was beamed onto the jum­botron screen.</p>
    <p>A sense of the pan­demic was preva­lent. KYMO – Keep Your Mask On – flashed on-screen. Ser­vice time was halved to 45 min­utes for sur­faces to be sani­tised, while wor­ship­pers ex­ited promptly with­out cross-min­gling with the next con­gre­ga­tion.</p>
    <p>Al­though it is eas­ier for the in­de­pen­dent church to stick to on­li­neonly ser­vices, its lead­ers want to pre­pare for the step-by-step lift­ing of ca­pac­ity lim­its. Also, col­lec­tive wor­ship is in­grained in Chris­tian life, its pas­tors say.</p>
    <p>Teacher Lee Chin Sin, 50, has been set­ting an alarm ev­ery Fri­day at noon to make sure she gets seats for Cor­ner­stone’s on-site ser­vice.</p>
    <p>“I was very moved, even on the way to church. We have been go­ing to church for 30 years, and it’s very much part of our life,” she says. “Of course, there was a tinge of sad­ness be­cause the au­di­to­rium was so empty.”</p>
    <p>Changes like the no-singing rule do not bother her. “Wor­ship is re­ally the mind fo­cus­ing on God,” she rea­sons.</p>
    <p>Watch­ing an on­line ser­vice on a com­puter at home can be “a bit im­per­sonal” – al­though there is an in­ter­ac­tive live chat, plus apps aplenty, say, for ser­mon notes.</p>
    <p>While not all churches are new hy­brids like Cor­ner­stone, most have on­line ser­vices. Most of their lead­ers are con­tem­plat­ing the rise of the e-church, with its pos­si­bil­i­ties and per­ils.</p>
    <p>The up­side is that vir­tual churches can go global. On­line cell groups and prayer meet­ings at churches big and small – in­clud­ing the Pres­by­te­rian de­nom­i­na­tion with 37 con­gre­ga­tions – are well at­tended be­cause time-crunched parish­ioners sim­ply click on a link at home.</p>
    <p>The flip side is some find it novel to church-hop when brows­ing a never-end­ing menu of Sun­day ser­vices here or glob­ally.</p>
    <p>As such, pas­tors are seek­ing new ways to con­nect with their scat­tered flock, whether through on­line prayer, prizes mailed to Sun­day school kids who nail Bi­ble quizzes, or even home­spun cook­ing tu­to­ri­als.</p>
    <p>As needs es­ca­late, churches are sup­port­ing the job­less in their midst. The more tech-savvy churches also pitch in to help less­re­sourced ones set up vir­tual churches.</p>
    <p>While these larger forces are at play, over at the Church of the Holy Fam­ily, a Ro­man Catholic par­ish down the road from Cor­ner­stone in Ka­tong, re­tired ac­coun­tant Sylvia Khoo savoured the in­ti­macy of on-site mass when the doors opened again to cir­cles of 50 ear­lier this month.</p>
    <p>“It was joy­ful to hear the peal­ing of the bells again,” says the 60some­thing Ms Khoo. Af­ter get­ting used to on­line mass for five months, she felt a “sud­den wow” see­ing the al­tar and the pews again – even if many were cor­doned off. Other pews had hand sani­tis­ers and QR codes for con­tact trac­ing.</p>
    <p>“Wor­ship­ping to­gether as a com­mu­nity is so im­por­tant,” adds Ms Khoo, who can now take part in ri­tu­als like com­mu­nion at the church of 8,000, al­beit by slot book­ing.</p>
    <p>As Catholic churches pro­gres­sively re­open this month, parish­ioners are lim­ited to one mass a month at a church they se­lect, with rou­tine church-hop­ping now dis­al­lowed.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the first week­end, close to 2,000 Catholics cel­e­brated mass in eight churches. There are 360,000 Catholics spread across 32 churches.</p>
    <p>The Ro­man Catholic Arch­dio­cese of Sin­ga­pore still urges the vul­ner­a­ble, such as se­nior ci­ti­zens above age 60 and those with med­i­cal con­di­tions, to stick with mass on­line.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some smaller Protes­tant parishes with fewer than 500 mem­bers, such as Sem­bawang Pres­by­te­rian Church, are also cir­cling back to phys­i­cal ser­vices, while megachurch­es like City Har­vest and New Cre­ation are stay­ing on­line for now.</p>
    <p>The de­sire for on-site ser­vices was borne out in an on­line survey of Christians con­ducted from May 11 to 18, in the mid­dle of the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Over 1,600 re­sponses were logged for this burn­ing ques­tion: “If/when things re­turn to a state of nor­malcy, are you likely to at­tend on­line church ser­vices?”</p>
    <p>HAPPY WITH A HY­BRID</p>
    <p>Mr Edric Sng, chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer of Thirst Col­lec­tive, a dig­i­tal Chris­tian news plat­form which in­cludes the Thir.st and Salt&Light web­sites and pushed out the straw poll, says of the over­all re­sult: “Al­most 95 per cent said they would con­tinue to do on-site church.”</p>
    <p>Of this 95 per cent ma­jor­ity, more than half said they much pre­fer phys­i­cally at­tend­ing church. The rest were happy with a hy­brid, say­ing they would likely go to both phys­i­cal and on­line churches.</p>
    <p>“Only 5.38 per cent said they would de­fault to on­line only,” he says.</p>
    <p>Mind­ful of the real need for com­mu­nity, churches are tend­ing to their charges afresh – and from afar.</p>
    <p>At City Har­vest, a megachurch of 16,000, kids aged three to 12 join Zoom ser­vices. Those who sub­mit cor­rect an­swers to Bi­ble quizzes get prizes in the mail.</p>
    <p>The di­alect-speak­ing elderly can view video ser­mons in Can­tonese and Hokkien on YouTube, or re­ceive calls and care packs that in­clude masks and Bi­ble verses from staff. Vis­its in phase two are now pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>More hy­per staff meet for Zoom work­outs be­fore work or join cook­ing tu­to­ri­als by the hos­pi­tal­ity pastor, whose reper­toire in­cludes Hakka bak chor mee.</p>
    <p>Such per­sonal touches are also im­por­tant for Cor­ner­stone. Its staff made 4,300 phone calls to church mem­bers dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Among its on­line moves are 8am de­vo­tion­als where spir­i­tual lead­ers share wis­dom in bite-sized videos. There are con­ver­sa­tions with pas­tors to keep ev­ery­one in the loop or ask ques­tions, for ex­am­ple, about Se­nior Pastor Yang Tuck Yoong’s book-writ­ing plans.</p>
    <p>With the fall­out from Covid-19, Cor­ner­stone is among many churches now boost­ing sup­port sys­tems for their mem­bers and the lo­cal com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Some years back, the Cor­ner­stone lead­er­ship pre­sciently cre­ated a spe­cial fund for the con­gre­ga­tion ahead of tough times. “Well, the time did come and in April, we of­fi­cially launched the Cor­ner­stone Cares Fund,” says Pastor Yang.</p>
    <p>The church set aside a $1-mil­lion seed fund. It also pledged to match do­na­tions dol­lar for dol­lar, up to a to­tal of $3 mil­lion of co-fund­ing. The to­tal tar­get is $4 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>“More than 100 fam­i­lies have ap­plied for the fund suc­cess­fully since the launch in April, and near to $250,000 has been dis­bursed.”</p>
    <p>The youth­ful Heart of God Church has since April given $170,100 in fi­nan­cial aid to 144 mem­bers. One hun­dred re­cip­i­ents are stu­dents, in the church of 5,000-plus where the av­er­age age is 22.</p>
    <p>To re­plen­ish na­tional blood stocks sapped by the pan­demic, the church teamed up with Khalid Mosque and two clan as­so­ci­a­tions for a blood do­na­tion drive last month.</p>
    <p>New Cre­ation Church, which has over 30,000 mem­bers, also had a blood do­na­tion drive. It has dis­trib­uted food-court gift cards to clean­ers at Tan Tock Seng Hos­pi­tal and sent more than 600 per­son­alised cards to cheer up the elderly.</p>
    <p>Else­where, the Hope Church, aware that the pan­demic can cause mar­i­tal rifts, in­vited any af­fected mem­bers to seek sup­port at its fam­ily life min­istry. Be­yond Sin­ga­pore, many churches like The Bi­ble Church are sup­port­ing over­seas mis­sions work, and have stepped up this role.</p>
    <p>In an e-church sce­nario, do­ing good, or preach­ing good news, can have a wider reach here or over­seas. So churches are think­ing hard about the emer­gence of the on­line church.</p>
    <p>Rev­erend Keith Lai, the Synod mod­er­a­tor or hon­orary head of the Pre­byste­rian de­nom­i­na­tion here, says: “We are forced by the pan­demic to re­con­sider and re­think the Church strate­gi­cally.”</p>
    <p>The de­nom­i­na­tion is hold­ing “new norms” we­bi­nars among its pas­tors. One in­trigu­ing is­sue is the re­or­gan­is­ing of the churches.</p>
    <p>“It is not just about mak­ing a few cos­metic changes or al­ter­ations here and there, but also to build ac­cord­ing to New Tes­ta­ment pat­terns, which are more or­ganic and spon­ta­neous,” says Rev Lai, who is also pres­i­dent of the Na­tional Council of Churches of Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>“Re­cently in a con­ver­sa­tion, I heard a help­ful de­scrip­tion of ‘or­ganic’, which is de­fined as some­thing that starts from ‘every­where to every­where’. It is nei­ther top down nor bot­tom up.”</p>
    <p>This may well be the tra­jec­tory of the post-Covid-19 church.</p>
    <p>Pas­tors in­ter­viewed cite the work of Chris­tian blog­ger and Cana­dian church founder Carey Nieuwhof, who wrote: “Grow­ing churches in the fu­ture will be­come dig­i­tal or­gan­i­sa­tions with phys­i­cal ex­pres­sions, not phys­i­cal or­gan­i­sa­tions with a dig­i­tal pres­ence.”</p>
    <p>This trend is a win­dow for churches to “break out of the four walls of a build­ing and en­ter into the liv­ing rooms of mem­bers and po­ten­tial parish­ioners alike”, Cor­ner­stone’s Pastor Yang be­lieves.</p>
    <p>While this is ex­cit­ing, he coun­sels: “Church is very much still a phys­i­cal gath­er­ing of be­liev­ers who must con­tinue to meet in per­son to build com­mu­nity and do life to­gether.”</p>
    <p>He is not over-per­turbed that peo­ple will vir­tu­ally church-hop. “Church at­ten­dance met­rics for on­line church are quite tricky to mea­sure as com­pared with phys­i­cal ser­vices. You don’t know how many are watch­ing from be­hind the screen, or how en­gaged they are,” he says.</p>
    <p>At t he on­set of t he cir­cuit breaker, he reck­ons peo­ple prob­a­bly did a bit of e-church hop­ping be­cause of the nov­elty. “Many churches saw an ini­tial surge in on­line at­ten­dance, pos­si­bly through many who e-church hopped.</p>
    <p>“And we’re talk­ing about a world­wide phe­nom­e­non caused by a global pan­demic, not just a lo­calised one. So you’d prob­a­bly have peo­ple tun­ing in from all over the world, across bound­aries and time zones.”</p>
    <p>But his guess is, af­ter the “fizz” set­tles, most would hop back to their home church.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Pastor Kenny Chee of the World Re­vival Prayer Fel­low­ship, who has blogged about how churches are trans­form­ing, says most of them will keep a stronger pres­ence on­line than they had be­fore. “This au­gurs well for the ‘new nor­mal’ church.”</p>
    <p>Also alert to the pos­i­tives, Se­nior Pastor Tan Seow How from Heart of God Church says: “While this pan­demic is hor­ri­ble, there are also pos­si­bil­i­ties. We don’t see it as a dis­rup­tor, but a driver.”</p>
    <p>The church is now run­ning both on­line and on-site ser­vices. “Our on­line ser­vices are run by and for young peo­ple with unique and in­ter­ac­tive con­tent.”</p>
    <p>Grate­ful for phase two, which al­lows in-per­son ser­vices, he says: “This of­fers at­ten­dees non­down­load­able ex­pe­ri­ences such as per­son­alised pas­toral care, train­ing and a sense of com­mu­nity, with safe man­age­ment mea­sures i n place.”</p>
