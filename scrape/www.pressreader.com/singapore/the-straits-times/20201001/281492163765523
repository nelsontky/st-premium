    <p>The num­ber of centenaria­ns – those aged 100 and above – in Sin­ga­pore has dou­bled over the past 10 years, from 700 in June 2010 to 1,500 in June this year.</p>
    <p>The fig­ure com­prises cit­i­zens as well as per­ma­nent res­i­dents, who are clas­si­fied as Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents, said a spokesman for the Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics.</p>
    <p>Old folk in their 80s and 90s have also gone up sub­stan­tially.</p>
    <p>The Pop­u­la­tion Trends 2020 re­port re­leased last week showed that in June, there were 103,100 Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents aged be­tween 80 and 89. The fig­ure is a 77 per cent in­crease from the 58,300 se­niors in this age group in June 2010.</p>
    <p>There were 20,900 Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents aged 90 and older in June, a 94 per cent jump from the 10,800 peo­ple in this age group a decade ago.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts who study age­ing is­sues say sev­eral fac­tors have helped Sin­ga­pore­ans live longer, in­clud­ing ad­vances in med­i­cal sci­ence and pub­lic health ser­vices, as well as higher stan­dards of liv­ing.</p>
    <p>A Sin­ga­pore res­i­dent baby born last year can ex­pect to live till about 84.</p>
    <p>One se­nior who is still go­ing strong in his twilight years spoke to The Straits Times, as the world marks the In­ter­na­tional Day of Older Per­sons to­day. The day was des­ig­nated by the United Na­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Kas­sim Sul­tan cel­e­brated his 100th birth­day on Sept 20.</p>
    <p>The cen­te­nar­ian is still sharp as ever – he is able to rat­tle off the phone num­bers of all his 12 chil­dren.</p>
    <p>Apart from a few mi­nor op­er­a­tions, such as for cataract and her­nia, he has had no health woes un­til re­cently when he fell down twice at home. He had to be hos­pi­talised and re­ceived two stitches on his head.</p>
    <p>Mr Kas­sim, who has 32 grand­chil­dren and 43 great-grand­chil­dren, now walks with the help of a walk­ing frame. The for­mer typ­ing in­struc­tor re­tired when he was 68.</p>
    <p>Be­fore those falls, he would walk to the shops ev­ery morn­ing to buy a copy of Malay news­pa­per Berita Har­ian. He would also go for walks around his Jurong West neigh­bour­hood.</p>
    <p>Mr Kas­sim, who lives with his 90-year-old wife, daugh­ter and son-in-law, would also wash and iron his own clothes.</p>
    <p>Asked about his secret to longevity, he said: “The secret is that I don’t drink ice wa­ter, and haven’t for 52 years. Ev­ery day, I also wake up to pray at 4am.”</p>
    <p>He is also a gen­er­ous man, hav­ing do­nated about $260,000 to var­i­ous mosques from the sales of two landed prop­er­ties.</p>
    <p>Aca­demics in­ter­viewed say the surge of se­niors aged 80 and older is sig­nif­i­cant and rapid.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans have the world’s long­est life ex­pectancy, said As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor An­gelique Chan, ex­ec­u­tive direc­tor of the Cen­tre for Age­ing Re­search and Ed­u­ca­tion at Duke-NUS Med­i­cal School.</p>
    <p>In fact, those aged 80 and older are the fastest-grow­ing seg­ment in Sin­ga­pore’s pop­u­la­tion, she said. And this surge, which comes as Sin­ga­pore ex­pe­ri­ences a per­sis­tent baby drought, has se­ri­ous im­pli­ca­tions for in­di­vid­u­als and Sin­ga­pore so­ci­ety.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, se­niors spend more years of their lives in frail health as they live longer, said Prof Chan, cit­ing re­search such as that done by the cen­tre. More of them are likely to be af­flicted with de­men­tia as the pro­por­tion of the “old­est old” – as those aged over 85 are called – rises sharply, she said.</p>
    <p>With more se­niors in frail health and need­ing care, this places a strain on their and their fam­ily’s fi­nances and care-giv­ing ar­range­ments, among other things.</p>
    <p>She said: “Due to smaller fam­ily sizes, the old­est old have fewer fam­ily mem­bers to rely on for so­cial and fi­nan­cial sup­port.”</p>
    <p>As life­spans in­crease, more are also likely to work for a longer pe­riod of time, Prof Chan said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore will raise the re­tire­ment age from 62 to 65 by 2030, while the re-em­ploy­ment age will go up from the cur­rent age of 67 to 70 by 2030.</p>
    <p>Be­sides rais­ing the re­tire­ment age, Ms Peh Kim Choo, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Tsao Foun­da­tion, feels that more can be done to ad­vo­cate against ageism in the work­place and in so­ci­ety, as Sin­ga­pore­ans live and work for longer pe­ri­ods of time.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Kang Soon Hock, Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sciences’ vice-dean of the School of Hu­man­i­ties and Be­havioural Sciences, noted that the el­derly are not a ho­mo­ge­neous group with younger se­niors be­ing bet­ter ed­u­cated.</p>
    <p>Among other things, many are likely to be ac­tive and pro­duc­tive, even in their old age, he said.</p>
    <p>Prof Kang said: “While the in­creases (in those aged 80 and older) may seem alarm­ing to some, it does not nec­es­sar­ily mean doom and gloom.”</p>
    <p>In­sti­tute of Pol­icy Stud­ies se­nior re­search fel­low Mathew Mathews called for more pro­grammes and ser­vices to en­gage se­niors to pre­vent so­cial iso­la­tion, among other things.</p>
    <p>As Prof Chan pointed out: “Older per­sons who have mean­ing and pur­pose in their lives, a sat­is­fy­ing so­cial life, a good sup­port sys­tem and fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity are far more likely to re­main healthy or re­cover suc­cess­fully from health is­sues.</p>
    <p>“This is com­pared with older adults who are lonely, so­cially iso­lated and with­out fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity.”</p>
    <p>HOLD THE ICE, PLEASE</p>
    <p>The secret is that I don’t drink ice wa­ter, and haven’t for 52 years. Ev­ery day, I also wake up to pray at 4am.</p>
