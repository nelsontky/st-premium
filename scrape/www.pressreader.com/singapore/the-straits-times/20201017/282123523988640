    <p>We re­fer to Ms Quek Shi­wei’s let­ter (Al­low par­ents to at­tend pre-school grad­u­a­tion con­certs, Oct 15).</p>
    <p>We recog­nise that kinder­garten grad­u­a­tion is a mile­stone for par­ents and chil­dren. How­ever, we have to take a care­ful ap­proach when re­sum­ing ac­tiv­i­ties in pre-schools, given the young age of the chil­dren and the pre-school set­ting.</p>
    <p>While more eco­nomic and so­cial ac­tiv­i­ties have grad­u­ally re­sumed in the com­mu­nity, strict safe man­age­ment mea­sures have been put in place and only some ac­tiv­i­ties have re­sumed on a pi­lot ba­sis.</p>
    <p>As pre-school premises are gen­er­ally smaller and more com­pact, safe dis­tanc­ing for large groups is more chal­leng­ing and this in­creases the risk of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>Young chil­dren also tend to need more time to get used to re­quire­ments, and it may be chal­leng­ing for them to ad­here to the ad­di­tional safe man­age­ment mea­sures re­quired for big group ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Grad­u­a­tion cer­e­monies typ­i­cally in­volve many chil­dren and par­ents com­ing to­gether across classes, and this presents sig­nif­i­cant trans­mis­sion risk.</p>
    <p>Grad­u­a­tion con­certs, in par­tic­u­lar, pose a risk as the chil­dren will in­ter­act with one another on stage, and the con­certs typ­i­cally in­volve singing, which leads to a greater ex­pul­sion of res­pi­ra­tory droplets and po­ten­tial virus par­ti­cles.</p>
    <p>To en­sure the safety and well-be­ing of chil­dren and staff, pre-schools have there­fore been guided to con­duct grad­u­a­tion cer­e­monies dif­fer­ently this year.</p>
    <p>This is aligned to the virtual grad­u­a­tion cer­e­monies for stu­dents in schools and other in­sti­tu­tions this year.</p>
    <p>Although grad­u­a­tion cer­e­monies will be con­ducted dif­fer­ently, many pre-schools are ex­plor­ing ways to make them spe­cial for the chil­dren and fam­i­lies.</p>
    <p>We ac­knowl­edge that the ar­range­ments for pre-school grad­u­a­tion cer­e­monies this year may cause dis­ap­point­ment for some par­ents and chil­dren.</p>
    <p>We seek par­ents’ un­der­stand­ing that the young age of the chil­dren re­quires us to take a more cau­tious stance.</p>
