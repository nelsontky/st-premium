    <p>My 13-year-old daugh­ter was re­cently di­ag­nosed with</p>
    <p>Avoidant Re­stric­tive Food In­take Disor­der, also re­ferred to as Se­lec­tive Eat­ing Disor­der.</p>
    <p>At the Na­tional Univer­sity Hos­pi­tal where she was ad­mit­ted re­cently, a group of very spe­cial peo­ple at­tended to her.</p>
    <p>My deep­est ap­pre­ci­a­tion goes to con­sul­tant Mary Sa­jani, psy­chol­o­gist Feli­cia Tay, di­eti­tian Denise Teo, art ther­a­pist Vic­to­ria and med­i­cal so­cial worker Lim Jia Yi.</p>
    <p>They took time out of their busy sched­ules to visit my daugh­ter at the ward, en­cour­age her and psy­che her up when they did not have to.</p>
    <p>I also com­pli­ment the nurses and health work­ers of Ward 47 who are re­lent­lessly try­ing to lift the spir­its of their pa­tients in these chal­leng­ing times.</p>
    <p>The road to full re­cov­ery might be long and fraught with anx­i­eties, but I am con­fi­dent, with the network of sup­port that my fam­ily and daugh­ter are re­ceiv­ing, that we will reach there soon.</p>
