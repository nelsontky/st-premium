    <p>About 17,000 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats will be launched next year, keep­ing the sup­ply of new flats i n line with what was launched this year.</p>
    <p>How­ever, given the eco­nomic un­cer­tainty due to Covid-19, the Hous­ing Board will mon­i­tor the mar­ket closely and cal­i­brate flat sup­ply if re­quired, said Na­tional De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Des­mond Lee in a Face­book post yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 16,752 BTO flats were launched across three sales ex­er­cises this year.</p>
    <p>Typ­i­cally, the HDB holds four BTO sales ex­er­cises in a year but due to the pan­demic, the May ex­er­cise was de­ferred and com­bined with the Au­gust BTO ex­er­cise.</p>
    <p>Next year, new flats will be of­fered in ma­ture es­tates such as Gey­lang, Kal­lang/Wham­poa, Bi­dadari es­tate in Toa Payoh and Ulu Pan­dan es­tate i n Queen­stown.</p>
    <p>Non-ma­ture es­tates such as Bukit Ba­tok, Ten­gah and Wood­lands will also see new flats, to of­fer flat buy­ers “a wide range of op­tions to choose from”, said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes Sin­ga­pore’s first as­sisted liv­ing pub­lic hous­ing for se­niors in Bukit Ba­tok, which will</p>
    <p>be launched next Fe­bru­ary.</p>
    <p>Th­ese 160 flats, ex­pected to be com­pleted in 2024, come with a manda­tory ser­vice pack­age to sup­port se­niors who wish to live on their own and yet en­joy some care, sup­port and com­mu­nal ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Many of the up­com­ing pub­lic hous­ing de­vel­op­ments will in­cor­po­rate fea­tures such as elec­tric ve­hi­cle-ready carparks, smart LED light­ing in com­mon ar­eas that dims when there is lit­tle hu­man traf­fic and smart pneu­matic waste con­veyance sys­tems, which send house­hold waste via an en­closed un­der­ground pipe net­work to a cen­tralised bin cen­tre, said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>Th­ese fea­tures are part of HDB’s new road map called De­sign­ing for Life that will guide the de­sign­ing and plan­ning of HDB towns and flats for the next decade or so.</p>
    <p>Green­ery will con­tinue to be a big part of pub­lic hous­ing de­vel­op­ments. “In com­ing up with the hous­ing plans, HDB has en­gaged and taken in the feed­back of var­i­ous part­ners, in­clud­ing na­ture groups, to try and strike a bal­ance be­tween con­ser­va­tion and de­vel­op­men­tal needs,” he said.</p>
    <p>This year, for the first time in 14 years, BTO flats were launched in the ma­ture es­tate of Bis­han across two hous­ing projects and both were heav­ily over­sub­scribed.</p>
    <p>The first batch of BTO flats was also launched in Ten­gah’s new­est Park dis­trict, as the “for­est town” con­tin­ues to take shape.</p>
    <p>Due to the pan­demic, the com­ple­tion dates of sev­eral BTO projects were also de­layed by be­tween six and nine months.</p>
    <p>BAL­ANC­ING DIF­FER­ENT NEEDS</p>
    <p>In com­ing up with the hous­ing plans, HDB has en­gaged and taken in the feed­back of var­i­ous part­ners, in­clud­ing na­ture groups, to try and strike a bal­ance be­tween con­ser­va­tion and de­vel­op­men­tal needs.</p>
