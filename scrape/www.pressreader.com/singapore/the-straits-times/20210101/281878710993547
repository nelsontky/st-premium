    <p>WASH­ING­TON • Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump was briefed l ast month about in­tel­li­gence re­ports that China had of­fered to pay boun­ties to fight­ers in Afghanista­n who at­tacked US sol­diers there, but the in­for­ma­tion was un­cor­rob­o­rated and comes months af­ter Mr Trump dis­missed as a “hoax” a Cen­tral In­tel­li­gence Agency as­sess­ment that Rus­sia had paid for such at­tacks.</p>
    <p>It is un­clear whether the in­tel­li­gence on China shows that any boun­ties were paid or whether any at­tacks on US per­son­nel were even at­tempted. US in­tel­li­gence agen­cies col­lect enor­mous amounts of in­for­ma­tion, much of which turns out to be false or mis­lead­ing.</p>
    <p>The in­for­ma­tion, in­cluded in the Pres­i­dent’s writ­ten brief­ing on Dec 17 and re­layed ver­bally by Na­tional Se­cu­rity Ad­viser Robert O’Brien, was re­ported by news web­site Ax­ios and con­firmed by US of­fi­cials. It comes at a time when Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials, in­clud­ing Di­rec­tor of Na­tional In­tel­li­gence John Rat­cliffe, have sought to put more pres­sure on China, partly in the hope of lim­it­ing any plans by the in­com­ing Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion to ease ten­sions with Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump, Mr Rat­cliffe and other of­fi­cials have also sought to di­rect at­ten­tion to­wards Chi­nese mis­be­haviour in ar­eas where other US of­fi­cials con­sider Rus­sia to be a greater threat, in­clud­ing com­puter hack­ing and the use of dis­in­for­ma­tion to dis­rupt Amer­i­can pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the dis­clo­sure last month that the US gov­ern­ment had been sub­jected to a huge cy­ber­breach which US of­fi­cials con­fi­dently at­trib­uted to Rus­sia, Mr Trump an­grily cast doubt on that no­tion and sought to im­pli­cate Bei­jing, say­ing on Twit­ter that “it may be China”.</p>
    <p>The Ax­ios re­port said the un­der­ly­ing in­tel­li­gence on the boun­ties would be de­clas­si­fied, but it was un­clear why or for whom. White House of­fi­cials would not elab­o­rate but did not dis­pute that it was un­cor­rob­o­rated.</p>
    <p>Al­though ten­sions be­tween the United States and China have es­ca­lated dur­ing the Trump era, Bei­jing is not known to pro­vide sub­stan­tial sup­port to anti-Amer­i­can prox­ies in com­bat zones like Afghanista­n. Some US na­tional se­cu­rity ex­perts were also scep­ti­cal Bei­jing would sup­port at­tacks on Amer­i­cans but many saw sim­i­lar re­ports about Rus­sian boun­ties to be cred­i­ble.</p>
    <p>Months be­fore the re­port in­volv­ing China, the Pen­tagon and US in­tel­li­gence were probing re­ports that Rus­sian mil­i­tary in­tel­li­gence agents had of­fered to pay Tale­ban­linked fight­ers in Afghanista­n for the killing of US sol­diers there. Mr Trump pub­licly dis­missed it as “fake news” and an ex­ten­sion of the “Rus­sia hoax”.</p>
