    <p>The open­ing whis­tle for the re­sump­tion of lo­cal sport was blown af­ter mixed mar­tial arts and foot­ball both made sig­nif­i­cant strides yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Hours be­fore One Cham­pi­onship’s Reign of Dy­nas­ties event played out be­hind closed doors at the Sin­ga­pore In­door Sta­dium, Min­is­ter for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth (MCCY) Ed­win Tong an­nounced that the Sin­ga­pore Premier League would re­sume next Satur­day af­ter a 211-day hia­tus.</p>
    <p>He in­di­cated that the foot­ball com­pe­ti­tion which, like all lo­cal sports, had been sus­pended due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, would also not be open to a live au­di­ence though fans can catch the ac­tion via live streams and on cable tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>Mr Tong, who is also the Sec­ond Min­is­ter for Law, wrote on his Face­book page: “Glad to hear that the Covid-19 swab test re­sults came back neg­a­tive for all 223 play­ers and match of­fi­cials. Coaches and team of­fi­cials will be masked up dur­ing games, along­side other safe man­age­ment mea­sures. Only the 22 play­ers and four match ref­er­ees on the field can be un­masked.”</p>
    <p>The Foot­ball As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore (FAS) also short­ened the sea­son from three rounds to two so that teams face each other only twice, thus al­low­ing the tour­na­ment to fin­ish by year end.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore Cup has also been an­nulled to avoid fix­ture con­ges­tion, a prob­lem many overseas leagues such as the English Premier League have faced on re­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>How­ever, a cloud re­mains over the par­tic­i­pa­tion of Ban­dar Seri Be­gawan-based Brunei DPMM, with travel re­stric­tions still in place in both coun­tries.</p>
    <p>FAS pres­i­dent Lim Kia Tong said the de­fend­ing cham­pi­ons have been pro­vided an op­tion to play their matches in Sin­ga­pore, and will wait for a favourable re­ply by Mon­day. He said: “This is an out­come that the FAS and the SPL clubs, along with Sport Sin­ga­pore and the rel­e­vant gov­ern­ment au­thor­i­ties, have worked tire­lessly to­wards in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>“The FAS will en­sure that all the nec­es­sary Covid-19 safe pro­to­cols are strictly ad­hered to, to en­sure the smooth restart of the league and hopes it will pave the way for more lo­cal sports leagues and events to re­sume.”</p>
    <p>With the Re­pub­lic host­ing sev­eral mar­quee sports events such as the For­mula One Sin­ga­pore Grand Prix an­nu­ally, which in­volve global stars who travel here from var­i­ous parts of the world, the One event had been touted as a pi­lot project by the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board. It fea­tures for­eign ath­letes who ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore and un­der­went quar­an­tine pe­ri­ods shorter than the stip­u­lated 14 days, among other re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the SPL’s re­sump­tion date was wel­comed by the foot­ball com­mu­nity. Gey­lang In­ter­na­tional coach Noor Ali said: “It is good news. We have one week to pre­pare and we are rar­ing to go. In the next few days, we hope to get more clar­ity in terms of any rule changes such as the num­ber of sub­sti­tu­tions al­lowed, so we can pre­pare ac­cord­ingly.”</p>
    <p>It is un­der­stood that the FAS will meet club of­fi­cials on Mon­day to share more de­tails.</p>
