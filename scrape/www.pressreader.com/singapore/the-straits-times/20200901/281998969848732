    <p>TOKYO • Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe told US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump that the strength­en­ing of their two na­tions’ al­liance would be main­tained even af­ter Mr Abe’s de­par­ture from of­fice, a Ja­panese govern­ment spokesman said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe an­nounced last Fri­day that he was re­sign­ing be­cause of poor health, his long-run­ning bat­tle with ul­cer­a­tive col­i­tis end­ing his ten­ure as Ja­pan’s long­est-serv­ing prime min­is­ter.</p>
    <p>“He wants Pres­i­dent Trump to rest as­sured be­cause the pol­icy of bol­ster­ing the Ja­pan-US al­liance will re­main un­changed,” Deputy Chief Cabi­net Sec­re­tary Ak­i­hiro Nishimura said.</p>
    <p>Mr Nishimura was speak­ing to re­porters af­ter a 30-minute tele­phone call be­tween Mr Abe and Mr Trump early yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump called Mr Abe the “great­est prime min­is­ter in Ja­pan’s his­tory”, ac­cord­ing to a White House spokesman.</p>
    <p>Mr Abe also told Mr Trump that Ja­pan would like to co­op­er­ate closely with the United States as it draws up a new mis­sile de­fence strat­egy, Mr Nishimura said.</p>
    <p>In a Twit­ter post yes­ter­day, Mr Abe wrote: “Don­ald, thank you for hon­our­ing me with your kind words. Since I first met you at Trump Tower in New York four years ago, we have de­vel­oped a deep re­la­tion­ship of trust and had so many bi­lat­eral meet­ings and phone calls.</p>
    <p>“Our part­ner­ship has made the Ja­pan-US re­la­tions more ro­bust than ever be­fore. My friend­ship and trust with you, Don­ald, means so much. I ap­pre­ci­ate your friend­ship from the bot­tom of my heart.”</p>
    <p>White House spokesman Judd Deere said Mr Trump told Mr Abe he had done a “fan­tas­tic job” and that the re­la­tion­ship be­tween their two coun­tries was stronger than it has ever been.</p>
