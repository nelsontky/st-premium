    <p>The ar­rival of the first batch of Covid-19 vac­cines on Mon­day marks a de­ci­sive step in Sin­ga­pore’s fight against the coro­n­avirus pan­demic. The vac­cines, the first ship­ment from Pfizer-BioNTech to ar­rive in Asia, were car­ried by a Sin­ga­pore Air­lines freighter whose land­ing at Changi Air­port was a sym­bolic mile­stone. The vac­cines are the next stage in the con­tin­u­ing ef­fort to re­verse the cu­mu­la­tive ef­fects of al­most a year of dis­rup­tion that has dev­as­tated the econ­omy and tested the so­cial sinews of the na­tion. Covid-19 has been one of the more se­vere chal­lenges that Sin­ga­pore has faced since in­de­pen­dence. The good news is that the coun­try is emerg­ing from this cri­sis with its re­silience in­tact.</p>
    <p>The ar­rival of the vac­cines speaks of the ef­forts made by the au­thor­i­ties to en­sure that Sin­ga­pore is not edged out by larger na­tions in the race to se­cure ac­cess to the es­sen­tial drugs. The coun­try needed to be proac­tive. That called for a com­bi­na­tion of strate­gies. First, Sin­ga­pore gained ac­cess to avail­able in­for­ma­tion, a process en­hanced by the for­ma­tion of a ther­a­peu­tics and vac­cines ex­pert panel. Its mem­bers went through data on po­ten­tial drugs and vac­cine can­di­dates to iden­tify the most promis­ing.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, an­other group was formed to make strate­gic as­sess­ments on some of the vac­cine can­di­dates rec­om­mended by the ex­pert panel. The Eco­nomic Devel­op­ment Board con­tacted a wide range of vac­cine mak­ers. Diver­si­fy­ing po­ten­tial sources of sup­ply not only made Sin­ga­pore less de­pen­dent on a sin­gle man­u­fac­turer even if all vac­cines should be ef­fec­tive, but re­duced its vul­ner­a­bil­ity to un­cer­tainty that even the more promis­ing vac­cines would suc­ceed even­tu­ally. Third, the more than $1 bil­lion that has been set aside to sup­port Sin­ga­pore’s search for vac­cines at­tests to the need for fi­nan­cial re­sources to make bids cred­i­ble. All in all, there was a clearly thought-out and im­ple­mented method­ol­ogy to the process that led to the ar­rival of the first batch at Changi Air­port this week. In­deed, the air­port could re­gain some of its clout in Asian con­nec­tiv­ity links, thanks to its po­si­tion as an avi­a­tion hub for the on­ward trans­mis­sion of vac­cines in the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Within Sin­ga­pore, the next step will be to en­sure the tar­geted dis­tri­bu­tion of vac­cines once they ar­rive. Thus far, only the Pfizer vac­cine has been au­tho­rised for use – not yet those pro­duced by Moderna or Si­no­vac. That ap­proval, should it oc­cur, along with the ca­pac­ity of the man­u­fac­tur­ers to de­liver the drugs, would de­ter­mine the time­line of the na­tional vac­ci­na­tion process. How­ever, the tar­get is to in­oc­u­late ev­ery­one by the third quar­ter of next year. The vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme could be pushed back or brought for­ward de­pend­ing on cir­cum­stances, but the time­line is re­as­sur­ing. Hope is around the cor­ner.</p>
