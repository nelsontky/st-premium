    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tish Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s gov­ern­ment was fac­ing fresh crit­i­cism yes­ter­day over its han­dling of grading for school ex­am­i­na­tions after re­sults for hun­dreds of thou­sands of stu­dents were pulled.</p>
    <p>Ed­u­ca­tion Sec­re­tary Gavin Wil­liamson has been ac­cused of over­see­ing a fi­asco in how grades have been awarded to teenagers who were un­able to take their ex­ams be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Exam board Pear­son an­nounced late on Wed­nes­day, just hours be­fore stu­dents were due to re­ceive their re­sults, that it would re­cal­cu­late grades for the BTECs – spe­cial­ist work-re­lated qual­i­fi­ca­tions.</p>
    <p>Its de­ci­sion came days after the gov­ern­ment bowed to pres­sure from an­gry stu­dents, teach­ers and law­mak­ers and ditched an al­go­rithm that had down­graded A-level re­sults for al­most 40 per cent of school leavers last week, with those in dis­ad­van­taged ar­eas more ad­versely af­fected.</p>
    <p>Stu­dents were told on Mon­day that they would now be awarded the grade that their teach­ers had pre­dicted for them based on past per­for­mance, and that process is also be­ing adopted for younger stu­dents who were set to re­ceive their GCSE re­sults yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>But Pear­son said that change meant it was now hav­ing to change its BTEC grades.</p>
    <p>“We have be­come con­cerned about un­fair­ness, in­clud­ing con­sis­tency with the ap­proaches now be­ing used for GCSE and A lev­els,” it said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Wil­liamson has been ac­cused of ig­nor­ing warn­ings that the grading sys­tem would lead to un­fair re­sults, and both he and Mr John­son have been lam­pooned by the me­dia for their han­dling of the is­sue.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery step of this way there are prob­lems you have to en­counter and deal with, and we are deal­ing with them swiftly,” Schools Min­is­ter Nick Gibb told BBC tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>“We’re work­ing, as I said, night and day to get these is­sues right.”</p>
    <p>He echoed Mr Wil­liamson’s apol­ogy for the un­cer­tainty and con­fu­sion caused.</p>
    <p>Ms Kate Green, ed­u­ca­tion spokesman for the op­po­si­tion Labour Party, said: “Mr Gavin Wil­liamson was warned again and again about the prob­lems with the grading al­go­rithm, and each time, he did noth­ing.</p>
    <p>“This end­less pat­tern of in­com­pe­tence is no way to run a coun­try.”</p>
