    <p>•</p>
    <p>For­mer cham­pion Si­mona Halep ar­rives at the resched­uled French Open as the player to beat in a women’s draw miss­ing ti­tle holder Ash­leigh Barty and US Open cham­pion Naomi Osaka.</p>
    <p>Two of the world’s top three women’s ten­nis play­ers will not be in Paris, while world No. 7 Bianca An­dreescu and 10th-ranked Belinda Ben­cic will also be giv­ing the Grand Slam a miss.</p>
    <p>That makes Halep the heavy favourite to add a sec­ond French Open ti­tle to her Grand Slam cab­i­net when the tour­na­ment starts to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>The world No. 2 is brim­ming with con­fi­dence on t he back of a 14-match win­ning streak and fight­ing fit, hav­ing skipped the US hard­court swing due to Covid-19 fears.</p>
    <p>She has spent the past few weeks hon­ing her game on clay and re­cent ti­tles in Prague and Rome ap­pear to vin­di­cate her de­ci­sion not to play at Flush­ing Mead­ows.</p>
    <p>The Ro­ma­nian be­lieves she is bet­ter placed, both phys­i­cally and men­tally, to chal­lenge for her third Slam ti­tle over­all.</p>
    <p>“It is dif­fer­ent (this year). It is true that I am fresher,” said Halep, who faces Spain’s Sara Sor­ribes Tormo in the first round. “Of course, I did work hard at home but I didn’t have many matches, so my body is not that used... And with th­ese matches (I won), I also feel con­fi­dent. So it’s a bet­ter chance.”</p>
    <p>But the tag of be­ing the woman to beat does not sit well with her.</p>
    <p>Be­fore tast­ing suc­cess at Roland Gar­ros two years ago, she had lost three Slam fi­nals, in­clud­ing against Je­lena Ostapenko in 2017 at the same venue as the Lat­vian pulled off a big up­set for her maiden Ma­jor. So Halep is de­ter­mined to put no ex­tra pres­sure on her­self at this year’s event, which she de­scribes as “just an­other tour­na­ment”.</p>
    <p>“I’ve played re­ally well this year with three ti­tles (in­clud­ing Dubai in March) al­ready,” the Wim­ble­don cham­pion said. “I’ve played so much on clay, so I feel con­fi­dent... I’ll just be happy to take pos­i­tives from this (Rome) tour­na­ment and go there smil­ing... and try to win every match I play. Every match is a bat­tle, I am ready for it.</p>
    <p>“As I said al­ways, many girls from the top 10, top 15 have a chance to win a Grand Slam. Roland Gar­ros is very open, be­cause it’s clay court but it’s a lit­tle bit faster, so also the big hit­ters can win it easy.</p>
    <p>“I can­not think about win­ning the ti­tle in Roland Gar­ros, be­cause the tour­na­ment didn’t start yet. But I will give my best. I will dream for it, for sure.”</p>
    <p>While she feels that this year’s French Open re­mains as open as ever, her peers think oth­er­wise.</p>
    <p>World No. 4 Karolina Pliskova, who is still gun­ning for her maiden Ma­jor, is tip­ping Halep to make a deep run at an event where she has reached the last eight and be­yond four times in the past six years.</p>
    <p>“The way she’s played... of course, she’s go­ing to be the most favourite from the women’s tour­na­ment,” the Czech said. “So I feel like she’s con­fi­dent.</p>
    <p>“For sure, she’s go­ing to be dan­ger­ous. I know the weather is not look­ing that great in Paris, so I think the con­di­tions just to like play ag­gres­sive game against her is go­ing to be quite tough.”</p>
    <p>Pliskova’s record in Paris is not great – she only once pro­gressed past the third round – but there are other se­ri­ous con­tenders in the ab­sence of world No. 3 Osaka and topranked Barty. While Roland Gar­ros is Ser­ena Wil­liams’ least suc­cess­ful Ma­jor with three vic­to­ries here, the for­mer world No. 1 can never be dis­counted ahead of an­other record­e­qualling 24th Slam sin­gles ti­tle bid. But she has had zero com­pet­i­tive clay matches lead­ing up to this event.</p>
    <p>Spa­niard Garbine Muguruza, who de­feated the Amer­i­can in the 2016 fi­nal here, is an­other con­tender and fel­low for­mer world No. 1 Vic­to­ria Azarenka of Be­larus is hop­ing to carry the mo­men­tum from her run to the US Open fi­nal to clay.</p>
