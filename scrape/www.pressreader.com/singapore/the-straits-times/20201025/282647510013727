    <p>From fried chicken to pizza and rice bowls to cur­ries, you can now have a full din­ner at some bars and clubs, as more drink­ing des­ti­na­tions turn “din­ers”.</p>
    <p>Be­yond strict Covid-19 re­stric­tions like early clos­ing times, smaller head­counts and softer mu­sic, many are now mak­ing the pivot from dance floor to din­ing, with the Gov­ern­ment’s an­nounce­ment ear­lier this week that venues such as bars, clubs, karaoke lounges and night­clubs are not likely to re­sume ac­tiv­i­ties af­ter Sin­ga­pore en­ters phase three.</p>
    <p>While many venues are still wait­ing for the au­thor­i­ties to ap­prove re­quests for change of use from nightlife venue to din­ing es­tab­lish­ment, a hand­ful – with the help of sup­port­ive land­lords – have powered ahead to re­make them­selves af­ter get­ting the rel­e­vant li­cences.</p>
    <p>On the cock­tail bar front, pi­o­neer­ing venue 28 Hong Kong Street (28HKS) and Jig­ger & Pony, crowned No. 1 on the list of Asia’s 50 Best Bars this year, both now serve din­ner op­tions while still run­ning cock­tail pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Eight-year-old Jig­ger & Pony was pre­vi­ously un­der the “bar, pub, night­club, disco” cat­e­gory, but has since tran­si­tioned to the “restau­rant and bar” cat­e­gory of li­cens­ing as part of its re­open­ing last month.</p>
    <p>Nine-year-old 28HKS has i ntro­duced a Proper Din­ner menu from 5pm to 7pm to try to make up for the fall in its usual late-night rev­enue.</p>
    <p>While it has al­ways served bar food like mac ‘n’ cheese balls and burg­ers, it now of­fers fried chicken and seabass plated meals as a way to get cus­tomers to come in ear­lier, now that venues have to close at 10.30pm.</p>
    <p>“28HKS is well-known as a high-en­ergy late-night venue, where his­tor­i­cally the ma­jor­ity of our rev­enue is gen­er­ated from 10pm to 2am, but (the re­stric­tions have) forced us to re­think what our op­er­a­tions must be,” says gen­eral man­ager Justin Pal­lack, 39.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, night­club op­er­a­tions re­main sus­pended, but clubs such as Cherry Dis­cotheque in Ce­cil Street and Magic Car­pet in Beach Road are re­open­ing and in­tro­duc­ing full-fledged food menus.</p>
    <p>Bol­ly­wood club Magic Car­pet, shut since late March, is look­ing to re­open next month as a multi-cui­sine restau­rant, serv­ing up ke­bab rolls, piz­zas, cur­ries and veg­e­tar­ian op­tions.</p>
    <p>But while it hopes to even­tu­ally open five days a week, founder Sanjay Rekhi feels that one of the chal­lenges will be chang­ing din­ers’ mind­sets about head­ing out to clubs on week­days, not just week­ends, and din­ing ear­lier.</p>
    <p>“Cus­tomers still as­so­ciate the place with week­end ac­tiv­i­ties, hence we will open only on Fri­days and Satur­days and for a paratha brunch on Sun­days,” he says.</p>
    <p>“We have to be re­al­is­tic; night­clubs may well be the last ones to open, but we can ei­ther wait for the storm to pass or learn to dance in the rain.”</p>
