    <p>The first signs for Mr Jared Goh that his sis­ter was not quite her­self were when he re­ceived phone calls af­ter she had faint­ing spells in public. Soon af­ter that, she be­came with­drawn and iso­lated her­self at home. That was more than 20 years ago. What Mr Goh, 55, did not know then was that she was suf­fer­ing from sev­eral men­tal health con­di­tions. It was only sev­eral years later that she told him and their par­ents that she had been di­ag­nosed with de­pres­sion.</p>
    <p>She was later also found to have anx­i­ety, panic dis­or­der and ago­ra­pho­bia – a con­di­tion of be­ing anx­ious in un­fa­mil­iar en­vi­ron­ments.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh said he and his par­ents could not un­der­stand what his sis­ter, 50, was go­ing through. He said: “Not know­ing any­thing about de­pres­sion or men­tal ill­nesses, I con­stantly told my sis­ter to snap out of it, telling her ev­ery­one has prob­lems and needs to han­dle them.”</p>
    <p>Even­tu­ally, she was warded at the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health (IMH). She was put on med­i­ca­tion but stopped tak­ing her pills in 2013, and had a ma­jor re­lapse and be­came sui­ci­dal.</p>
    <p>Mr Goh slowly gave up leisure ac­tiv­i­ties, and felt he had no peace of mind. All the time, he was kept busy wor­ry­ing about his sis­ter, and spend­ing much of his free time af­ter work with her.</p>
    <p>He said: “I was feel­ing anx­ious, not know­ing what else may hap­pen next. I was feel­ing lost, not too sure how I could help her. I also felt frus­trated at times, es­pe­cially when I thought I could have some time for my­self, and then I got ac­ti­vated to at­tend to her.</p>
    <p>“There were thoughts of ‘Why me?’ and ‘Who else?’ I didn’t sleep well, and be­cause my work was also de­mand­ing, I al­most broke down.”</p>
    <p>He even­tu­ally quit his job at a multi­na­tional com­pany to take care of his sis­ter and his mother, who was also hav­ing health prob­lems.</p>
    <p>The pres­sure that comes with car­ing for peo­ple with men­tal health is­sues was in the spot­light re­cently af­ter a man was jailed for killing his men­tally ill daugh­ter. A psy­chi­atric as­sess­ment found that he was suf­fer­ing from a ma­jor de­pres­sive episode and care­giver stress.</p>
    <p>Ex­perts told The Straits Times that the stress of car­ing for per­sons with men­tal health dis­or­ders can take a toll on their care­givers’ men­tal and phys­i­cal health, and can even cause burnout.</p>
    <p>Ad­junct As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Lee Cheng, a se­nior con­sul­tant and vice-chair­man (clin­i­cal) of the med­i­cal board at IMH, said: “The most com­mon men­tal health con­se­quences iden­ti­fied among the care­givers are de­pres­sion, anx­i­ety, burnout or even post-trau­matic stress symp­toms.”</p>
    <p>Care­giver bur­den can be seen in three ar­eas – dis­rup­tion of the care­giver’s life, the emo­tional im­pact of care­giv­ing, and the ex­tent that the care­giver feels the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties are overly de­mand­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>When car­ing for a per­son re­cov­er­ing from a men­tal health con­di­tion, care­givers may find them­selves on an emo­tional roller coaster that closely fol­lows the ups and downs of the per­son’s con­di­tion, said Ms Heather Ong, lead spe­cial­ist for projects and pro­grammes at the Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion for Men­tal Health. They may also strug­gle with per­suad­ing the per­son to be com­pli­ant with treat­ment, she added.</p>
    <p>Some­times, care­givers may not re­alise that they need to seek help for them­selves. Mr Calvin Leong, a nurse man­ager with Care­giverAsia, said: “One can be tired phys­i­cally, men­tally and emo­tion­ally from car­ing for a men­tal health pa­tient and not know it be­cause the signs and symp­toms creep in slowly.”</p>
    <p>Signs to look out for in­clude pro­longed feel­ings of sad­ness and anx­ious­ness, neg­a­tive changes in at­ti­tude to­wards the per­son one is tak­ing care of, fa­tigue, ir­ri­tabil­ity, in­abil­ity to con­cen­trate, so­cial with­drawal, and changes in eat­ing and sleep­ing pat­terns, said ex­perts.</p>
    <p>In the worst case, anger, help­less­ness, frus­tra­tion or guilt may lead to harm­ing or hav­ing thoughts of harm­ing the pa­tient. Some peo­ple may even want to com­mit sui­cide so they can be free of care­giv­ing.</p>
    <p>But not all who need help seek it. This could be due to a fear of stigma, not know­ing they are burnt out or not know­ing where to find sup­port, said Mr Leong.</p>
    <p>A Fei Yue Com­mu­nity Ser­vices spokesman said care­givers need emo­tional sup­port and psy­cho-ed­u­ca­tion to learn how to bet­ter sup­port loved ones with men­tal health is­sues and respite ser­vices.</p>
    <p>For Mr Goh, a psy­chi­a­trist rec­om­mended that he seek sup­port from non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion Care­givers Al­liance Lim­ited (CAL).</p>
    <p>He signed up for a 12-week Care­givers-to-Care­givers Train­ing pro­gramme, where he learnt about men­tal health con­di­tions, skills like cri­sis man­age­ment and com­mu­ni­ca­tions, strate­gies to han­dle re­lapses, how to un­der­stand his own emo­tional needs and care for him­self.</p>
    <p>He later be­gan vol­un­teer­ing with CAL, and later joined the or­gan­i­sa­tion, where he is now head of op­er­a­tions and part­ner­ships.</p>
    <p>Travel and ex­er­cise have also been his go-to av­enues for self­care, as well as tak­ing care of his plants at home, added Mr Goh.</p>
    <p>His sis­ter, who lives with their par­ents, is in a sta­ble con­di­tion now.</p>
    <p>Care­givers look­ing for sup­port can turn to sev­eral av­enues. CAL also has an emo­tional sup­port pro­gramme and care­giver sup­port groups. Agen­cies such as Club Heal, Sin­ga­pore As­so­ci­a­tion for Men­tal Health and Care Cor­ner Coun­selling Cen­tre pro­vide coun­selling.</p>
    <p>An Agency for In­te­grated Care spokesman said it has worked with com­mu­nity men­tal health part­ners since 2012 to de­velop a net­work to sup­port pa­tients and care­givers.</p>
