    <p>THO­LEY (Ger­many) • For Ab­bot Mau­ri­tius Cho­riol, the new church win­dows cer­e­mo­ni­ously in­au­gu­rated last Satur­day at Tho­ley Abbey are a gift: from God, from two gen­er­ous pa­trons and from Ger­hard Richter.</p>
    <p>The three win­dows – with deep reds and blues pre­vail­ing on the two outer dis­plays and the cen­tral one dom­i­nated by ra­di­ant gold – are made in stained glass to a sym­met­ri­cal de­sign by Richter, the revered Ger­man artist.</p>
    <p>“Ab­stract art is not nor­mally my thing,” said the ab­bot, who over­sees Tho­ley Abbey. “But you don’t need to be an art ex­pert to ap­pre­ci­ate the qual­i­ties of these.”</p>
    <p>Since the in­stal­la­tion was com­pleted on Sept 10, the abbey’s monks have been able to en­joy the win­dows in peace. But if all goes ac­cord­ing to plan, that will change: The win­dows, at more than 9m tall, play a key role in the monks’ plan to se­cure the abbey’s fu­ture by turn­ing it into a cen­tre for hos­pi­tal­ity and ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Be­gin­ning next month, the abbey grounds will be open to the pub­lic six days a week. A re­port com­mis­sioned by the monks said the new work by Richter could at­tract up to 100,000 vis­i­tors by next Septem­ber.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion to Richter’s win­dows, the abbey com­mis­sioned Mah­buba Maq­soodi, an Afghan-Ger­man artist, to cre­ate 34 more win­dows for the church. Her fig­u­ra­tive im­ages por­tray saints and scenes from the Bi­ble.</p>
    <p>Tho­ley is the old­est work­ing abbey in Ger­many. The first sur­viv­ing doc­u­ment that men­tions it dates from AD 634. Si­t­u­ated in tran­quil green hills near the bor­ders with France and Lux­em­bourg, the abbey is home to 12 Bene­dic­tine monks who meet five times a day to pray. They also grow fruit, keep rab­bits and chick­ens, and make quince</p>
    <p>schnapps, honey and jam.</p>
    <p>Twelve years ago, the abbey was near to clos­ing. The gar­den was a jun­gle, the win­dows were drafty, the walls were damp, and the ab­bot at the time was tired of his job, ac</p>
    <p>cord­ing to Cho­riol. “It was in a very sorry sit­u­a­tion, fi­nan­cially and in per­son­nel terms,” he said.</p>
    <p>Then, in 2008, a pair of wealthy bene­fac­tors stepped in. Mr and Mrs Ed­mund and Ur­sula Meiser, a lo­cal busi­ness­man and his wife, who are both com­mit­ted Catholics, first of­fered to build a fence around the abbey’s gar­den. They then paid for a ren­o­va­tion of the chap­ter house, built a new gate and re­stored a baroque pavil­ion on the abbey grounds.</p>
    <p>In 2018, the monks and the Meis­ers turned their at­ten­tion to the abbey church, whose cor­roded win­dows were “flak­ing away like pas­try”, the ab­bot said. They set up an anony­mous com­pe­ti­tion for an artist to re­design most of them, which Maq­soodi won.</p>
    <p>Yet the monks also wanted a work by a fa­mous artist for the church’s choir win­dows, a fo­cal point be­hind the al­tar, where the morn­ing sun shines through into the nave. Cho­riol said their in­spi­ra­tion was the cathe­dral win­dows in the nearby city of Metz, France, which are by Marc Cha­gall and at­tract thou­sands of vis­i­tors a year.</p>
    <p>“But Cha­gall is dead,” the ab­bot said. “So we asked, ‘Who is the most fa­mous artist in the world?’ Ger­hard Richter sprang to mind. We didn’t think he would say yes.”</p>
    <p>A lo­cal or­gan­ist, Bern­hard Leonardy, wrote to Richter. In June, the artist called Leonardy and left a voice­mail mes­sage. “Ger­hard Richter from Cologne here,” he said. “It’s about the old­est monastery in Ger­many. It all sounds won­der­ful, but I am too busy and sim­ply too old. I don’t think I can do it.” Then fol­lowed a 10-sec­ond pause. “Al­though – I would like to do it,” he added.</p>
    <p>The monks wrote to Richter ex­press­ing con­cern that his fee might be too high. Af­ter all, an ab­stract paint­ing by Richter fetched about US$45 mil­lion at Sotheby’s in London in 2015. The artist replied to say he would de­sign the win­dows for free. “Not a cent,” Cho­riol said. “We were speech­less.”</p>
    <p>Richter, 88, de­clined to be in­ter­viewed for this ar­ti­cle. His stu­dio said he was not well enough. But in brief com­ments re­ported by the Ger­man press agency DPA last Wed­nes­day, Richter said the Tho­ley win­dows might be the last en­try in the of­fi­cial cat­a­log of his works, which be­gins with the 1962 paint­ing Ta­ble. The win­dows will be No. 957 in the cat­a­logue. Short of a mir­a­cle, “that’s it”, DPA re­ported him as say­ing. These are not Richter’s first church win­dows, how­ever.</p>
    <p>A stained-glass struc­ture that he de­signed for Cologne Cathe­dral, con­tain­ing 11,263 ran­domly ar­ranged coloured squares, was met with crit­i­cism and ad­mi­ra­tion when in­au­gu­rated in 2007. Cologne’s arch­bishop at the time, Car­di­nal Joachim Meisner, caused a furore when he said the ab­stract de­sign with no di­rect ref­er­ence to the Bi­ble was “bet­ter suited to a mosque”.</p>
    <p>With their re­cur­ring pat­terns and in­tense colours, Richter’s win­dows at Tho­ley Abbey re­sem­ble the de­sign of a Per­sian rug. But not only has the abbey in­stalled a win­dow whose East­ern flair and ab­stract de­sign Meisner may have con­sid­ered bet­ter suited to a mosque, but it also com­mis­sioned Maq­soodi, an artist who grew up in a Mus­lim fam­ily.</p>
    <p>Maq­soodi, who was granted po­lit­i­cal asy­lum in Ger­many in 1994, trained as a minia­tur­ist in Herat, Afghanista­n. “It is won­der­ful to find a place to ex­hibit that is per­ma­nent, and where the doors are al­ways open,” she said of the abbey, adding that she felt her win­dows com­ple­mented Richter’s. “The colours,” she said. “I think our works har­monise.” And the main dif­fer­ence? “No one knows me,” she said. “His name is known around the world.”</p>
