    <p>We thank Mr Tan Tor Seng (Brief ex­ten­sion for 5-year COE pe­riod, Nov 27) for his feed­back.</p>
    <p>All new cer­tifi­cates of en­ti­tle­ment (COEs) are valid for 10 years in the first in­stance. The owner of a 10-year-old ve­hi­cle can re­new the COE for an­other 10 years based on the Pre­vail­ing Quota Pre­mium (PQP). Own­ers who do so will re­ceive a re­bate on the PQP paid if they sub­se­quently dereg­is­ter their ve­hi­cles early.</p>
    <p>As an ex­cep­tion, the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity pro­vides a five-year re­newal op­tion for own­ers who feel that their ve­hi­cles may not last for an­other 10 years. This is on the con­di­tion that their ve­hi­cles must be dereg­is­tered at the end of five years. This con­di­tion is made known to ve­hi­cle own­ers when they re­new their COEs.</p>
    <p>Un­der­stand­ably, some own­ers may feel dif­fer­ently af­ter five years, but it will not be fair to the other car own­ers for an ex­cep­tion to be granted.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, as the COEs from dereg­is­tered ve­hi­cles are re­turned to the pool of COEs avail­able for bid­ding, al­low­ing fur­ther ex­ten­sion of five-year COEs could re­duce the sup­ply of COEs avail­able for bid­ding, which may then push up COE prices. This will then af­fect peo­ple who need to buy new ve­hi­cles, es­pe­cially dur­ing this pe­riod.</p>
    <p>As a whole, our ve­hi­cle own­er­ship sys­tem aims to be fair, while tak­ing into ac­count the dif­fer­ent needs of ex­ist­ing car own­ers and prospec­tive own­ers. Ong Hui Guan</p>
    <p>Deputy Group Di­rec­tor,</p>
