    <p>OR­LANDO (Florida) The Toronto Rap­tors had won only one of four games against the Bos­ton Celtics in the 2019-20 Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) reg­u­lar sea­son.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day night, they were half a se­cond away from los­ing their third straight game to the Celtics in the East­ern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nals.</p>
    <p>Down by two points and two games, the reign­ing NBA cham­pi­ons needed some­one to con­jure up some magic to break this curse. Up stepped O.G. Anunoby.</p>
    <p>The Bri­tish-Nige­rian Rap­tors for­ward drained a buzzer-beat­ing three-pointer, as Toronto re­sus­ci­tated their NBA ti­tle de­fence with a 104-103 vic­tory over Bos­ton.</p>
    <p>Kyle Lowry, tasked with in­bound­ing the ball with half a se­cond on the clock and the Rap­tors down 103-101, lofted a per­fect arc­ing pass over Bos­ton’s tow­er­ing Tacko Fall to Anunoby on the op­po­site side­line.</p>
    <p>Anunoby set his feet and fired, and the Rap­tors nar­rowed the deficit in the best-of-seven East­ern Con­fer­ence semi-fi­nal se­ries to 2-1.</p>
    <p>“I ex­pected to make it. I don’t shoot try­ing to miss... I wasn’t sur­prised,” said Anunoby, who was mobbed by his team­mates.</p>
    <p>The Rap­tors avoided a 0-3 hole – from which no NBA team has come back to win a post-sea­son se­ries.</p>
    <p>“The pass was noth­ing. O.G. made the shot,” said Lowry, who led the Rap­tors with 31 points, six re­bounds and eight as­sists.</p>
    <p>“All the credit goes to the shot, man. That’s a tough shot. Give O.G. that credit.”</p>
    <p>Fred VanVleet scored 17 of his 25 points in the se­cond half and Pas­cal Si­akam scored 14 of his 16 af­ter the in­ter­val while Anunoby con­tributed 12 points for the Rap­tors, who bat­tled back from a 57-47 half-time deficit.</p>
    <p>“We scrapped and clawed and fought,” said Lowry. “We never quit.”</p>
    <p>In a fourth quar­ter that saw seven lead changes – nei­ther team up by more than four points – Bos­ton looked set to take a stran­gle­hold on the se­ries when cen­tre Daniel Theis, fed by Kemba Walker’s savvy pass through traf­fic, slammed home a dunk for a 103-101 lead with 0.5 se­cond on the clock.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the en­su­ing time­out, Bos­ton brought in Fall, who tops out at 2.26m, to de­fend the in­bounds play, but he could not hold back the 2019 cham­pi­ons.</p>
    <p>“Much credit to those guys. That was a hell of a shot,” said Bos­ton’s Walker, who led the Celtics with 29 points. Jaylen Brown added 19 with 12 re­bounds and Jayson Ta­tum chipped in 15, but Bos­ton have a se­ries on their hands now.</p>
    <p>Game 4 is to­day and Celtics coach Brad Stevens has urged his side to be on their toes for the clash. “It hurts and stings to lose,” he said. “But we’ll just get back to it and get ready for Satur­day.”</p>
    <p>The Rap­tors, mean­while, will be build­ing on mo­men­tum but Lowry has warned his team­mates not to get ahead of them­selves af­ter this vi­tal vic­tory.</p>
    <p>“One game at a time,” he said of the Rap­tors’ mind­set as they look to level the se­ries in the NBA’s Covid-19 quar­an­tine bub­ble in Or­lando, Florida.</p>
    <p>“Great emo­tional mo­ment right there (but) that’s over. Now we have to fo­cus on the next game.”</p>
