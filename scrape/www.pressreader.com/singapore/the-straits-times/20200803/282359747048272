    <p>LON­DON • Frank Lam­pard ac­cused his Chelsea side of com­pla­cency af­ter slip­ping to a 2-1 FA Cup fi­nal de­feat by Arsenal on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The Blues made the per­fect start af­ter Chris­tian Pulisic fired them ahead just five minutes in.</p>
    <p>But Arsenal stepped up a gear af­ter the early blow, with cap­tain Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang equal­is­ing from the penalty spot be­fore half-time, then mak­ing it 2-1 with a fine fin­ish af­ter the in­ter­val.</p>
    <p>Chelsea tried to pull level, but were ham­pered by a lack of cut­ting edge, while their de­fen­sive frail­ties – a con­sis­tent theme through­out the sea­son – proved to be their un­do­ing at Wem­b­ley.</p>
    <p>They were not helped by the ex­tremely harsh se­cond-half dis­missal of Ma­teo Ko­vacic for a se­cond yel­low card, on top of in­juries to Pulisic, Ce­sar Azpilicuet­a and sub­sti­tute Pe­dro, although Lam­pard re­fused to make ex­cuses.</p>
    <p>“We started well for 10 or 15 minutes, scored a goal and had other chances,” he told the BBC. “From that point, we can only blame our­selves in foot­ball terms.</p>
    <p>“We de­cided to take con­trol as in be­ing com­pla­cent, let’s try and play short passes like it is a bit of a stroll. A fi­nal can never be a stroll and we al­lowed them back into the game.”</p>
    <p>Lam­pard, who was aim­ing for his first tro­phy as a man­ager, had tried to get his play­ers to re­fo­cus, but was un­able to get his mes­sage across to his side.</p>
    <p>“All I can do from the side­lines is shout. There are el­e­ments in our game that we have worked hard on all year, but that is in you as a group,” the 42-year-old for­mer mid­fielder said.</p>
    <p>“We were slow, we played back on our­selves, in­vited pres­sure, then didn’t re­ally know where to go from that. We didn’t play well enough to win a fi­nal.</p>
    <p>“It doesn’t help to have two ham­strings and a dis­lo­cated shoul­der, then Wil­lian got in­jured yes­ter­day and had to pull out.</p>
    <p>“It’s the end of a long, long sea­son and it was the tip­ping point for us.”</p>
    <p>De­spite their Cup fi­nal mis­ery, Chelsea have achieved their main aim by qual­i­fy­ing for next sea­son’s Cham­pi­ons League via a fourth­placed English Pre­mier League fin­ish.</p>
    <p>Their cam­paign is not over as they travel to Bay­ern Mu­nich on Satur­day for the se­cond leg of their Cham­pi­ons League last-16 tie.</p>
    <p>It will, how­ever, be an up­hill task for the Blues at the home of the Ger­man cham­pi­ons, who lead 3-0 from the first leg.</p>
    <p>Both Pulisic and Azpilicuet­a will miss that clash, while Pe­dro has joined Roma fol­low­ing the Cup’s con­clu­sion.</p>
    <p>I think he wants to stay, it is about get­ting the deal done. Mo­ments like that will help to re­alise and give him be­lief we are on the right path and he is a big part of it. ’’</p>
    <p>MIKEL ARTETA, Arsenal man­ager, hopes that the FA Cup win will con­vince striker Pierre-Em­er­ick Aubameyang to stay at the Emi­rates.</p>
