    <p>They take great pains to en­sure that their web­sites are pro­fes­sion­ally de­signed. The prod­ucts are well-dis­played and there is even a sec­tion high­light­ing pop­u­lar items based on cus­tomer pur­chases.</p>
    <p>The check­out process is also user-friendly: buy­ers just need to in­put their credit card de­tails; there is no need to sign up.</p>
    <p>To en­sure they get good traf­fic on­line, they even op­ti­mise their web­sites so that any­one us­ing Google to search for re­lated prod­ucts will be di­rected to their site as well.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has be­come a boom time for them be­cause the lock­downs that have shut many shops world­wide have driven on­line trans­ac­tions to record lev­els.</p>
    <p>As they are sell­ing var­i­ous health­care and med­i­cal items, more peo­ple are likely to con­sider buy­ing.</p>
    <p>Sounds like a great suc­cess story amid these bleak times? Un­for­tu­nately these folks are not hon­est busi­ness peo­ple but du­bi­ous char­ac­ters us­ing e-com­merce in in­no­va­tive new ways to dupe peo­ple.</p>
    <p>They are no longer tak­ing the lazy way of send­ing poorly writ­ten emails to po­ten­tial vic­tims who they hope will re­spond to their fake deals. In­stead, du­bi­ous mer­chants are set­ting up very well-de­signed on­line stores that some­times look even bet­ter than le­git­i­mate ones.</p>
    <p>Their on­line tac­tics are so so­phis­ti­cated that when­ever some­one is search­ing for a par­tic­u­lar prod­uct, a pic­ture of the same prod­uct from the dodgy web­site of­ten gets listed to­gether with the re­sults from gen­uine sellers.</p>
    <p>Un­sus­pect­ing cus­tomers un­for­tu­nate enough to buy from them will lose their money be­cause they will never re­ceive the goods.</p>
    <p>The Health Sci­ences Au­thor­ity (HSA) re­cently flagged one such scam – a site called Oph­thal­me­try that pur­ported to sell top-grade med­i­cal equip­ment for op­tometrists.</p>
    <p>The e-store claimed to be based at 212 Or­chard Turn but the ad­dress does not ex­ist and the com­pany is not reg­is­tered here.</p>
    <p>The HSA re­ported the case to the po­lice. The web­site, which has been around since at least 2018, has been taken down.</p>
    <p>There are some over­seas e-stores that claim to be Sin­ga­porean com­pa­nies pur­port­edly sell­ing health­care-re­lated prod­ucts here.</p>
    <p>The peo­ple be­hind this are based over­seas. These e-stores op­er­ate with a .sg do­main to make cus­tomers think they are le­git­i­mate Sin­ga­pore busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>One such store – ninelife.sg – even has “Sin­ga­pore” ap­pear­ing next to its name on its web­site but it does not in­clude an ad­dress here. In­stead, it lists of­fices in the United States, Bri­tain, Hong Kong and In­dia.</p>
    <p>But a Google map search of these ad­dresses tells a dif­fer­ent story.</p>
    <p>The US ad­dress leads to an an­tique store along a coastal high­way in the state of Delaware, while the ad­dress in Lon­don shows a row of empty of­fices. The site also lists a +65 Sin­ga­pore tele­phone num­ber but call­ing it leads to a ma­chine with an in­com­pre­hen­si­ble mes­sage.</p>
    <p>A check shows that this same “store” has a sim­i­lar web­site with a Ninelife.uk do­main as well. An on­line search with the name re­veals many com­plaints about this es­tore.</p>
    <p>The pan­demic is driv­ing the pro­lif­er­a­tion of such web­sites so con­sumers would do well to pro­tect them­selves. Here are some tips:</p>
    <p>DON’T JUST BE­LIEVE WHAT YOU SEE</p>
    <p>Do not rely only on your on­line search en­gine re­sults. On­line crooks are very good in us­ing such tools to trap their vic­tims.</p>
    <p>In sev­eral scams re­ported over­seas, fake air­line sites are be­ing used to dupe peo­ple who want to post­pone their flights due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>These sites use the name of gen­uine air­lines so vic­tims who handed over their tick­ets thought they were deal­ing with the ac­tual car­rier when they clicked on the links pro­duced by the search en­gines.</p>
    <p>Sim­i­larly, if you are shop­ping on­line, don’t blindly buy from the first mer­chant that pops up in your search en­gine re­sults un­less it is from a rep­utable store.</p>
    <p>BUY FROM REP­UTABLE E-STORES</p>
    <p>Think twice be­fore you buy from an un­fa­mil­iar stand­alone store. Rep­utable on­line e-com­merce firms have their own re­fund and se­cu­rity poli­cies that pro­tect cus­tomers. They will not know­ingly al­low crooks to sell on their plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Even if you want to pur­chase from stand­alone on­line stores, make sure you buy only from those which list suf­fi­cient gen­uine de­tails such as ad­dresses, tele­phone num­bers and e-mails. Af­ter all, what busi­ness does not want to make it easy for cus­tomers to reach them?</p>
    <p>If you are buy­ing an ex­pen­sive item, try to call or visit the mer­chant if it is in Sin­ga­pore to ver­ify that it is a gen­uine busi­ness.</p>
    <p>While list­ing con­tact de­tails is no guar­an­tee of a sat­is­fac­tory ser­vice, avoid those who don’t even bother to pro­vide ad­dresses and so on.</p>
    <p>FIND OUT WHAT OTH­ERS SAY</p>
    <p>Look for re­views of a mer­chant. You can al­ways count on ag­grieved vic­tims shar­ing their feed­back on­line to warn oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Yes, a bad re­view does not mean the store is crooked but you should be wary if the neg­a­tive feed­back is about the mer­chant not de­liv­er­ing the items at all or when the word “scam” is used by many cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Note that some scam­mers like to neu­tralise bad com­ments with their own five-star re­views too.</p>
    <p>If you see both re­views, you should prob­a­bly buy from another mer­chant.</p>
    <p>BE WARY OF WHEN “EX­PERTS” ARE THROWN IN</p>
    <p>Any­one surf­ing for videos on­line would have stum­bled on this re­cent phe­nom­e­non – video ads that ped­dle highly in­no­va­tive prod­ucts that are sup­pos­edly in­vented by “ex­perts” who are again based in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>But if you note the names, you might be sur­prised that a search on­line will not pro­duce any re­sults on these “ex­perts”.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, sev­eral “ex­perts” in Sin­ga­pore with West­ern names have ap­par­ently in­vented new ways to watch TV, cool the air in your room and brush your teeth with gad­gets that cost less than $100.</p>
    <p>This begs the ques­tion: If they are in­deed bril­liant Sin­ga­pore in­ven­tors who have come up with these revo­lu­tion­ary new gad­gets, would it not make sense for them to call a press con­fer­ence so that their sto­ries are told to the world le­git­i­mately?</p>
    <p>At the very least, they should have a de­cent on­line site with links to pop­u­lar so­cial me­dia plat­forms that enable cus­tomers to get in touch with them eas­ily.</p>
    <p>And fi­nally, be wary when such mer­chants claim they can sell their prod­ucts at low prices be­cause they “don’t be­lieve in ad­ver­tis­ing”. It’s a strange con­tra­dic­tion when this claim is made in a video ad that is cir­cu­lated on­line.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple sel­dom get duped at phys­i­cal stores be­cause they com­pare prices and only shop at mer­chants they are com­fort­able with.</p>
    <p>When you shop on­line, you should do so with the same mind­set – don’t let the con­ve­nience of on­line make you a care­less shop­per.</p>
    <p>Stan­dard Char­tered Bank’s Natalia Goh says card hold­ers should set up SMS alerts to be kept in­formed of all trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Vin­cent Tan from OCBC Bank warns that cus­tomers can be li­able for card losses if they are lax on se­cu­rity.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Du&#xAD;bi&#xAD;ous mer&#xAD;chants are set&#xAD;ting up well-de&#xAD;signed on&#xAD;line stores and us&#xAD;ing so&#xAD;phis&#xAD;ti&#xAD;cated on&#xAD;line tac&#xAD;tics to dupe un&#xAD;sus&#xAD;pect&#xAD;ing cus&#xAD;tomers, the writer warns. Some over&#xAD;seas e-stores claim to be Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;porean com&#xAD;pa&#xAD;nies, but one such store&#x2019;s web&#xAD;site does not list an ad&#xAD;dress here. In&#xAD;stead it lists an of&#xAD;fice in the United States, and a Google Maps search shows the US ad&#xAD;dress lead&#xAD;ing to an an&#xAD;tique store along a coastal high&#xAD;way in the state of Delaware.</p>
