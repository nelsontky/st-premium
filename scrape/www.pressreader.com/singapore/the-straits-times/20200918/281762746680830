    <p>There were 18 new coron­avirus cases con­firmed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>This is the low­est daily fig­ure since March 16, which had 17 cases.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s new cases in­cluded one com­mu­nity case who is a work pass holder, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old In­dian na­tional is un­linked to pre­vi­ous cases.</p>
    <p>He was con­firmed to be pos­i­tive on Wed­nes­day. Al­though asymp­to­matic, he was de­tected from the ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers in the con­struc­tion, ma­rine and pro­cess sec­tors who are liv­ing out­side dor­mi­to­ries.</p>
    <p>There were also two new im­ported cases – a work pass holder who re­turned from France and a de­pen­dant’s pass holder who re­turned from In­dia.</p>
    <p>Both were asymp­to­matic and had been placed on stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>Sim Lim Square was the only new place added to the list of lo­ca­tions vis­ited by Covid-19 patients while they were still in­fec­tious, MOH said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A visit to the mall was recorded on Sept 4.</p>
    <p>The min­istry pro­vides the list of lo­ca­tions and the times that in­fec­tious Covid-19 patients have vis­ited for at least 30 min­utes, to get those who were at these places at spe­cific pe­ri­ods to mon­i­tor their health closely for two weeks from the date of their visit.</p>
    <p>The full list of lo­ca­tions and times can be found on MOH’s web­site.</p>
    <p>MOH has said that close con­tacts would al­ready have been no­ti­fied and that there is no need to avoid these places as they would have been cleaned if needed.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 15 new coron­avirus cases an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing the to­tal to 57,532.</p>
    <p>Among these, 10 were iden­ti­fied as con­tacts of pre­vi­ous cases and had al­ready been quar­an­tined to prevent fur­ther trans­mis­sion. They were tested dur­ing their quar­an­tine pe­riod, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing five cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing, such as ros­tered rou­tine test­ing of work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries, which is con­ducted ev­ery fort­night.</p>
    <p>No new clus­ters were an­nounced by MOH yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The av­er­age num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity in a week has de­creased from two cases two weeks ago to one in the past week.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at fewer than one case per day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>With 84 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,024 patients have fully recovered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 43 patients remain in hos­pi­tal, while 423 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
