    <p>More pri­vate clin­ics, lab­o­ra­to­ries and other health­care providers will be able to ad­min­is­ter Covid-19 poly­merase chain re­ac­tion (PCR) tests for the pub­lic, apart from some 600 that are cur­rently ap­proved to con­duct these tests, Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Beef­ing up test­ing ca­pac­ity in the pri­vate sec­tor will gen­er­ate com­pe­ti­tion and in­crease the avail­abil­ity of sup­plies, he added.</p>
    <p>“And by do­ing so, we will en­sure that the price they are of­fered (at) will be com­pet­i­tive, and that will re­flect the true cost of the test,” said Mr Gan, co-chair of the Multi-min­istry Task­force tack­ling Covid-19, at a vir­tual press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>From Dec 1, more peo­ple will be able to take these PCR tests, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) an­nounced yes­ter­day. Any com­pany or in­di­vid­ual who needs a PCR test can pro­cure the ser­vice from ap­proved providers.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, PCR tests are only for mem­bers of the pub­lic with Covid-19 symp­toms, or who need to meet spe­cific test­ing re­quire­ments, such as for pre-de­par­ture test­ing if they are trav­el­ling, or if they are work­ers who need to un­dergo ros­tered rou­tine test­ing.</p>
    <p>PCR test­ing, which re­quires skilled lab­o­ra­tory tech­ni­cians to process sam­ples, is the gold stan­dard in terms of ac­cu­racy. But they are more costly and take slightly longer to process than other op­tions such as anti­gen rapid tests or breathal­yser tests.</p>
    <p>Cur­rently, a PCR test here is es­ti­mated to cost around $200.</p>
    <p>The pro­cured PCR tests will not be sub­sidised, and those who seek these tests at pri­vate providers will have to bear the cost, said MOH’s direc­tor of med­i­cal ser­vices Ken­neth Mak.</p>
    <p>But the au­thor­i­ties are work­ing with var­i­ous lab­o­ra­to­ries and ser­vice providers to fur­ther re­duce the cost of PCR tests, he added.</p>
    <p>MOH said that en­hanc­ing the ac­ces­si­bil­ity of PCR tests will al­low Sin­ga­pore to sup­port a larger range of needs as the coun­try re­sumes more eco­nomic and com­mu­nity ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>This is also a crit­i­cal part of Sin­ga­pore’s strat­egy against Covid-19 as it moves to­wards phase three of its re­open­ing, Ed­u­ca­tion Min­is­ter Lawrence Wong, co-chair of the task force, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>As for anti­gen rapid tests, Mr Gan said the au­thor­i­ties are con­tin­u­ing to use them in pi­lot runs of pre-event test­ing, which will en­able more large-scale and high­er­risk ac­tiv­i­ties to re­sume in a safer man­ner.</p>
    <p>Pi­lots runs were con­ducted at the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Week and the One Cham­pi­onship mixed mar­tial arts events last month, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Anti­gen rapid tests can give re­sults more quickly, are cheaper and are eas­ier to ad­min­is­ter than PCR tests, al­though they are slightly less ac­cu­rate. It is not known how much they will cost.</p>
    <p>A pi­lot scheme for karaoke es­tab­lish­ments and night­clubs that will kick off by Jan­uary will re­quire them to en­sure cus­tomers test neg­a­tive for Covid-19 within the past 24 hours via a PCR test or an anti­gen rapid test.</p>
    <p>Asked if the cost of anti­gen rapid tests can be low­ered, Mr Gan said the au­thor­i­ties are in dis­cus­sions with labs and sup­pli­ers on whether the pric­ing can be fine-tuned.</p>
    <p>“But also it’s an is­sue re­lat­ing to vol­ume. I would imag­ine that with more test­ing be­ing ap­plied, with the vol­ume be­ing driven up, the pric­ing can prob­a­bly come down some­what,” he said.</p>
    <p>But there are also sig­nif­i­cant costs in­volved in set­ting up test­ing fa­cil­i­ties, be­sides the cost of the test it­self, he added, and the au­thor­i­ties are try­ing to es­tab­lish what kind of set-up for anti­gen test­ing will be more ef­fi­cient and cost-ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>As­so­ci­ate Pro­fes­sor Mak added that Sin­ga­pore is work­ing with var­i­ous com­pa­nies to bring in more anti­gen rapid tests. The ca­pac­ity of the tests will also grow in tan­dem as pi­lot runs of pre-event test­ing are be­ing ex­panded, he said.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties are also work­ing through the pro­cesses that should be in place for the use of anti­gen rapid tests at events, rang­ing from smaller events like wed­dings to Mice (meet­ings, in­cen­tives, con­ven­tions and ex­hi­bi­tions) events.</p>
    <p>“We hope to be able to ex­tend the scale of events for which preevent test­ing can be pro­vided us­ing these anti­gen rapid tests,” said Prof Mak.</p>
