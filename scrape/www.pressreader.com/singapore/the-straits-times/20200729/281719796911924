    <p>Jaunts to Sin­ga­pore’s South­ern Is­lands and vir­tual tours for over­seas view­ers are among the of­fer­ings lo­cal tour op­er­a­tors have in the works to sur­vive the tourist drought.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tors were given some re­lief yes­ter­day when the Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board (STB) an­nounced that walk­ing, cy­cling and kayak­ing tours may now ac­com­mo­date up to 10 par­tic­i­pants, double the pre­vi­ous limit.</p>
    <p>As five re­mains the cur­rent limit for public gath­er­ings, how­ever, groups that ex­ceed this must be split into two, with no in­ter­min­gling al­lowed, ac­cord­ing to up­dated guide­lines for tour op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>Tours may also now run for a max­i­mum of eight hours, up from two pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Th­ese al­lowances come amid a newly launched cam­paign to en­cour­age lo­cals to prop up tourism busi­nesses, as well as low num­bers of Covid-19 com­mu­nity cases.</p>
    <p>Tour op­er­a­tors and tourist guides have been al­lowed to re­sume oper­a­tions from this month, sub­ject to ap­proval from the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try.</p>
    <p>The STB told The Straits Times that it has re­ceived 47 ap­pli­ca­tions so far, of which 36 have ob­tained ap­proval to go ahead with their sub­mit­ted tour itin­er­ar­ies and sched­ules.</p>
    <p>“While the up­dated guide­lines al­low for in­creased group size and longer tours, tour op­er­a­tors must still com­ply with all pre­vail­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures,” the STB said.</p>
    <p>The tourism board, to­gether with En­ter­prise Sin­ga­pore and Sen­tosa Devel­op­ment Cor­po­ra­tion, launched a $45 mil­lion cam­paign last week to drive lo­cal spend­ing at eater­ies, shops and leisure at­trac­tions, which have been hit hard.</p>
    <p>Tour op­er­a­tors that The Straits Times spoke to said they have seen a healthy num­ber of book­ings over the last two weeks, though not enough to turn a profit.</p>
    <p>Mr Stan­ley Foo, co-founder of Ori­en­tal Travel and Tours, said the firm is fo­cus­ing on its Creepy Tales Of Sin­ga­pore night tour for now as it had proven pop­u­lar among lo­cals even be­fore the pan­demic hit.</p>
    <p>The op­er­a­tor is also de­vel­op­ing other of­fer­ings for the lo­cal mar­ket, such as trips to Pu­lau Ubin and the South­ern Is­lands.</p>
    <p>While he ex­pects at least 40 to 50 lo­cal book­ings this month – twice the usual num­ber – that is not enough to sus­tain busi­ness in the long term, he said.</p>
    <p>“Right now, it is just about hang­ing in there and cre­at­ing jobs for our guides and trans­port op­er­a­tors rather than mak­ing money.”</p>
    <p>Mr Foo noted that the re­laxed rules on group size will help with cost sav­ings, though the ex­ten­sion of tour du­ra­tion limit from two to eight hours is a big­ger re­lief.</p>
    <p>Mr Suen Tat Yam, founder of Mon­ster Day Tours, said he has re­ceived about eight book­ings for the com­ing long week­end.</p>
    <p>The firm’s walk­ing tours of precincts like Lit­tle In­dia and Kam­pong Glam have been branded as SG55 tours, in line with the lo­cal fo­cus and Na­tional Day cel­e­bra­tions.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has also re­cently launched vir­tual tours, a prod­uct that it ex­pects to have mileage be­yond the cur­rent travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“Vir­tual tours have the ad­van­tage of be­ing able to reach out to peo­ple over­seas, and cor­po­rate events are all on hold,” Mr Suen noted.</p>
    <p>For $10, par­tic­i­pants can book a time slot for a tour of the one-north area, mar­keted as Sin­ga­pore’s Sil­i­con Val­ley. Dur­ing the live stream­ing, they can ask the guide ques­tions and par­tic­i­pate in quizzes and other ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“We didn’t want to de­velop a prod­uct just for the cur­rent sit­u­a­tion. More peo­ple are now open to the idea of vir­tual tours... so we think that even af­ter Covid, it can still be a good prod­uct.”</p>
    <p>SAFETY FIRST</p>
    <p>While the up­dated guide­lines al­low for in­creased group size and longer tours, tour op­er­a­tors must still com­ply with all pre­vail­ing safe man­age­ment mea­sures.</p>
