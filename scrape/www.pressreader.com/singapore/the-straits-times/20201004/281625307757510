    <p>Coro­n­avirus-stricken Pres­i­dent Donald Trump, 74, has been given an ex­per­i­men­tal treat­ment de­signed to com­bat the dis­ease, the White House said.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s gen­der, age and weight make him more vul­ner­a­ble to de­vel­op­ing se­vere Covid-19, and give him a no­tional risk of around 4 per cent of dy­ing from it, health ex­perts said.</p>
    <p>What is the ex­per­i­men­tal treat­ment Mr Trump is tak­ing?</p>
    <p>Mr Trump is tak­ing an an­ti­body cock­tail, the use of which has been re­ported to im­prove symp­toms in non­hos­pi­talised Covid-19 pa­tients, with no se­ri­ous side ef­fects in tri­als.</p>
    <p>The man­u­fac­tured copies of hu­man an­ti­bod­ies to Covid-19 are de­signed to fight the virus im­me­di­ately. United States in­fec­tious dis­eases chief An­thony Fauci is among those say­ing it shows prom­ise.</p>
    <p>What else is Mr Trump tak­ing?</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s doc­tor said the Pres­i­dent is tak­ing sev­eral medicines, in­clud­ing: • Vi­ta­min D and min­eral zinc, both of which are im­por­tant to the im­mune sys­tem.</p>
    <p>• Heart­burn drug famo­ti­dine, which re­searchers are study­ing as a po­ten­tial treat­ment.</p>
    <p>• Mela­tonin, a sleep aid.</p>
    <p>• As­pirin, which Mr Trump has pre­vi­ously said he takes daily. It can help avoid heart at­tacks and is a fever re­ducer.</p>
    <p>How about hy­drox­y­chloro­quine?</p>
    <p>Mr Trump early in the pan­demic backed the idea of us­ing an­ti­malaria drug hy­drox­y­chloro­quine to treat Covid-19. The Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) briefly al­lowed its use be­fore say­ing in June it had de­ter­mined hy­drox­y­chloro­quine was not ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>What hap­pens if Mr Trump’s con­di­tion wors­ens?</p>
    <p>For pa­tients hos­pi­talised with Covid-19, the FDA has given emer­gency-use au­tho­ri­sa­tion for two treat­ments: Vek­lury, also known as remde­sivir, an in­tra­venous an­tivi­ral drug shown to shorten hos­pi­tal stays, and con­va­les­cent plasma, which is de­rived from the blood of peo­ple who have sur­vived the dis­ease. Mr Trump has re­ceived a first dose of remde­sivir, his doc­tor said on Fri­day.</p>
