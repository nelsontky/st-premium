    <p>•</p>
    <p>With the lat­est coro­n­avirus flare-up in Thai­land hit­ting al­most two-thirds of the coun­try, the author­i­ties are tight­en­ing mea­sures to con­tain in­fec­tion risks ahead of the New Year hol­i­days.</p>
    <p>Bangkok or­dered sports and en­ter­tain­ment venues to close from yes­ter­day through Jan 4, with a pos­si­ble ex­ten­sion if things do not im­prove in a week. Tak, a prov­ince bor­der­ing Myan­mar, and the na­tion’s virus hot spots – Sa­mut Sakhon and Ray­ong – have im­posed sim­i­lar re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>The lat­est wave of cases, which started after a seafood ven­dor tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 two weeks ago, has spread to 60 per cent of Thai­land’s 77 prov­inces.</p>
    <p>Thai­land was bet­ting on a tourism re­vival to pull it out of re­ces­sion. But the lat­est out­break has added more than 2,000 cases in the past 10 days, mak­ing up 30 per cent of the coun­try’s to­tal tally.</p>
    <p>There has been “a large surge” in new cases in Ray­ong, Chon­buri, Chantaburi and Sa­mut Prakarn prov­inces, Mr Taweesilp Wit­sanuy­otin, a spokesman for the na­tional Covid-19 re­sponse cen­tre, said yes­ter­day. A to­tal of 45 prov­inces have re­ported lo­cal trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Prayut Chan-ocha’s gov­ern­ment has to choose be­tween short-term gains from spending dur­ing New Year cel­e­bra­tions and the risk of long-term dam­age to the econ­omy from an out­break go­ing out of con­trol, pub­lic health ex­pert Thira Wo­rata­narat, an as­so­ci­ate pro­fes­sor at Chu­la­longkorn Univer­sity’s fac­ulty of medicine, said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple also have to de­cide be­tween having a party and risk­ing spread­ing the virus, he said.</p>
    <p>“Whether a lock­down needs to be im­posed will de­pend on how co­op­er­a­tive peo­ple are with the cur­rent mea­sures,” Mr Prayut said after a Cabi­net meet­ing yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The new cases may spike to as high as 18,000 a day in Jan­uary if no con­trols are im­ple­mented, Mr Taweesilp said.</p>
    <p>The coun­try can limit new in­fec­tions to about 1,000 cases a day with curbs, he said.</p>
    <p>“The win­dow to con­tain the out­break is within four weeks from the start so we have un­til mid-Jan­uary be­fore cases in­crease ex­po­nen­tially,” Pro­fes­sor Thira said.</p>
    <p>“There needs to be strict mea­sures in place, and we need to test as many peo­ple as pos­si­ble... If we don’t curb in­fec­tions now it could take as long as three months to con­tain the out­break.”</p>
