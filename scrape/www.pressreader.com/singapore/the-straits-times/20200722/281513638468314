    <p>Te­masek’s port­fo­lio has taken a hit amid the Covid-19 pan­demic, pre­lim­i­nary fig­ures re­leased yes­ter­day showed.</p>
    <p>The Singapore in­vest­ment com­pany saw its net port­fo­lio value shrink for the first time in four years to $306 bil­lion as of March 31, 2.2 per cent lower than its record $313 bil­lion last year. Its port­fo­lio value was $308 bil­lion in 2018.</p>
    <p>The to­tal share­holder re­turn for one year also en­tered neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory, drop­ping to mi­nus 2.3 per cent, from 1.49 per cent pre­vi­ously.</p>
    <p>Te­masek In­ter­na­tional chief ex­ec­u­tive Dil­han Pil­lay said that on the whole, it was pleased with its per­for­mance, in the face of the global cri­sis caused by Covid-19. Te­masek’s fi­nal num­bers, which are not ex­pected to dif­fer ma­te­ri­ally, will be out in Septem­ber as the pan­demic has af­fected fi­nan­cial re­port­ing for many of its port­fo­lio com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic took its toll on the port­fo­lio of Te­masek, but did not hurt it too badly, pre­lim­i­nary num­bers re­leased yes­ter­day showed.</p>
    <p>The net port­fo­lio value (NPV) shrank for the first time in four years and the to­tal share­holder re­turn (TSR) for one year slipped into neg­a­tive ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>Still, given how hard the pan­demic has hit markets over­all, Te­masek In­ter­na­tional chief ex­ec­u­tive Dil­han Pil­lay San­drasegara said in a me­dia state­ment: “On the whole, we are pleased with our per­for­mance, de­spite the sharp cor­rec­tion due to Covid-19.”</p>
    <p>Te­masek’s NPV stood at $306 bil­lion as of March 31, lower than its record $313 bil­lion last year and $308 bil­lion in 2018.</p>
    <p>Its one-year TSR dropped to mi­nus 2.3 per cent, from 1.49 per cent pre­vi­ously, ac­cord­ing to pre­lim­i­nary fig­ures that are based on cur­rent unau­dited in­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>Te­masek’s fi­nal num­bers will be re­leased in Septem­ber, as its chief ex­ec­u­tive Ho Ching had flagged ear­lier that the pan­demic had af­fected fi­nan­cial re­port­ing for many of its port­fo­lio com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Still, the group’s fi­nal per­for­mance re­sults are not likely to dif­fer ma­te­ri­ally from the pre­lim­i­nary num­bers, it noted.</p>
    <p>“We were not spared the im­pact of Covid,” said Mr Pil­lay, adding that the end of Te­masek’s fi­nan­cial year co­in­cided with some of the worst of the mar­ket dis­lo­ca­tion dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Since then, how­ever, the value of its listed as­sets has risen.</p>
    <p>Te­masek also said it out­per­formed mar­ket in­dexes dur­ing the virus-in­duced down­turn, as it did dur­ing the Sars epi­demic in 2003 and the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in 2009.</p>
    <p>It stressed that it is an in­vestor with a long-term hori­zon. Its NPV had grown steadily be­fore the on­set of the virus and tripled from $90 bil­lion in 2004, when it pro­duced its first an­nual per­for­mance re­port.</p>
    <p>Its TSR over the last 16 years is 7.5 per cent. TSR takes into ac­count all div­i­dends dis­trib­uted to share­hold­ers mi­nus cap­i­tal in­jec­tions.</p>
    <p>On how it has per­formed over the past year rel­a­tive to mar­ket in­dexes in Asia, Te­masek said its port­fo­lio “stayed re­silient” with a 2.3 per cent de­cline, com­pared with the MSCI Singapore In­dex and the MSCI AC Asia ex-Ja­pan In­dex, which fell 18.3 per cent and 9.0 per cent re­spec­tively.</p>
    <p>Mr Pil­lay cau­tioned that ris­ing geopo­lit­i­cal and trade ten­sions – now ex­ac­er­bated by Covid-19 – will cre­ate more un­cer­tain­ties for longterm in­vestors and as­set own­ers.</p>
    <p>But Te­masek has a good mix of listed and un­listed in­vest­ments, a good bal­ance be­tween port­fo­lio stal­warts, and new in­vest­ments into emerg­ing and longer-term trends, which add to its re­silience, he said.</p>
    <p>Its un­listed port­fo­lio com­pa­nies such as port op­er­a­tor PSA also con­tinue to pro­vide steady re­turns, said Mr Pil­lay, even as it gears up for future chal­lenges like the hy­dro­gen econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Amid the pan­demic, Te­masek led a multi­bil­lion-dol­lar res­cue pack­age for Singapore Air­lines and sup­ported a rights is­sue by loss-mak­ing rig builder Sem­b­corp Marine.</p>
    <p>May­bank Kim Eng se­nior economist Chua Hak Bin told The Straits Times yes­ter­day that Te­masek’s per­for­mance was com­mend­able, given the steep stock mar­ket plunge in March.</p>
    <p>“Most eq­uity funds were prob­a­bly down 10 to 20 per cent in that same time­frame,” he said.</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing economist Song Seng Wun called the re­sults “less bad than ex­pected”, adding: “This is a chal­leng­ing time try­ing to nav­i­gate through a re­ces­sion­ary pe­riod, while await­ing the start of a new sus­tain­able growth cy­cle.”</p>
    <p>On the whole, we are pleased with our per­for­mance, de­spite the sharp cor­rec­tion due to Covid-19. ’’</p>
