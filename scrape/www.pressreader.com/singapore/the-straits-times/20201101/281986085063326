    <p>Ms Claire Lim, 32, had been sit­ting with a mid-20th cen­tury rice bas­ket for hours, con­sid­er­ing if there was any­thing to fix and, if so, how.</p>
    <p>The con­ser­va­tor at the Her­itage Con­ser­va­tion Cen­tre (HCC) in Jurong is acutely aware of how ev­ery de­ci­sion she makes will have his­tor­i­cal sig­nif­i­cance, and could change how peo­ple un­der­stand and in­ter­pret the cen­tury-old ob­ject.</p>
    <p>The rice bas­ket in ques­tion was last used for serv­ing rice on cer­e­mo­nial oc­ca­sions on the In­done­sian is­land of Madura and is now in the cus­tody of the HCC.</p>
    <p>Tasked to get it ready for ex­hi­bi­tion, Ms Lim likens what she does to “surgery” – it will en­tail ex­pe­ri­ence, dis­cern­ment and cre­ativ­ity.</p>
    <p>“Not ev­ery­thing that’s dirty needs to be cleaned. Not ev­ery­thing that’s bro­ken needs to be stitched back to­gether,” she said.</p>
    <p>“We want to make sure what we do is re­versible and that it is all recorded and not hid­den. It could change the ob­ject’s sig­nif­i­cance, its value and what is im­por­tant about it.”</p>
    <p>Ob­jects gain mean­ing as they are used. Un­think­ingly mak­ing a used bas­ket pris­tine could negate decades of change that would ob­fus­cate in­stead of help his­to­ri­ans un­der­stand how they were used in the real world.</p>
    <p>The HCC stores, pre­serves and dis­trib­utes the more than 200,000 arte­facts and paint­ings in Sin­ga­pore’s na­tional col­lec­tion. Ev­ery piece is pro­cessed here, but only a</p>
    <p>frac­tion is dis­played to the pub­lic in mu­se­ums like the Na­tional Gallery and the Asian Civil­i­sa­tions Mu­seum at any time.</p>
    <p>While it plays a sup­port­ing role to the gal­leries, the HCC has in fact been at the cen­tre of Sin­ga­pore’s cul­tural land­scape for 20 years.</p>
    <p>To­day, it will take a step from the wings onto the main stage for a change. Amid muted cel­e­bra­tions of its mile­stone an­niver­sary, it is launch­ing a video se­ries to take view­ers on a live tour of its fa­cil­i­ties that are usu­ally out of bounds to the pub­lic.</p>
    <p>“Hear from the pas­sion­ate col­lec­tions team, con­ser­va­tors, pho­tog­ra­phers and es­tate man­agers as they take you be­hind the scenes, giv­ing you a rare op­por­tu­nity to wit­ness what they do ev­ery day,” prom­ises the Na­tional Her­itage Board (NHB), which will host the Face­book Live videos on its page.</p>
    <p>NHB over­sees the HCC and other cul­tural in­sti­tu­tions here.</p>
    <p>HCC di­rec­tor Ong Chiew Yen, 47, took The Sun­day Times on an ex­clu­sive tour of the cen­tre’s premises last month.</p>
    <p>Now in her sec­ond year at the helm, Ms Ong high­lighted how, just 20 years ago, hav­ing such world­class, pur­pose-built fa­cil­i­ties for cul­tural ob­jects was a pipe dream.</p>
    <p>“It is a priv­i­lege for us to be work­ing so close to the na­tional col­lec­tion – hav­ing this fa­cil­ity here and a team of this size,” she said.</p>
    <p>The cen­tre now has on its pay­roll 33 con­ser­va­tors and 26 oth­ers in charge of man­ag­ing the col­lec­tion. It has 26 col­lec­tion stores, many of which are cal­i­brated to main­tain a pre­cise tem­per­a­ture and hu­mid­ity so ob­jects are not dam­aged in stor­age.</p>
    <p>In prac­tice, this some­times means em­ploy­ees work in rooms with no win­dows. Ms Agnes Sing, 48, a se­nior col­lec­tions of­fi­cer, said she works in to­tal si­lence and can­not see if the sun has gone down or what the weather out­side is.</p>
    <p>Yet, her love of the job has kept her go­ing for nearly 22 years. She finds the quiet and soli­tude “ther­a­peu­tic”, and said the beauty and cul­tural value of the pa­per and paint­ings which she helps ar­chive make it all worth­while.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tor Chen Chuance, 37, wanted to work in the fash­ion in­dus­try when he was younger, but now spe­cialises in tex­tiles at the HCC.</p>
    <p>He fre­quently deals with silk threads when restor­ing items and some­times can be found squint­ing as he uses tweez­ers to make stitches be­cause of how thin the ma­te­rial is.</p>
    <p>Point­ing at a Per­anakan bead slip­per, he said what needs main­te­nance is of­ten un­ex­pected. It is sym­bolic of the work the con­ser­va­tors at the HCC do.</p>
    <p>“You would think it is the beads that need care, but it is the threads that are bind­ing the beads to­gether. That is my job,” he said. “There is no short­cut to re­fin­ing my skill. I do it 100 times.”</p>
    <p>So eas­ily dis­placed are the gos­samer threads that “when I sew, I some­times re­mind my­self not to breathe”, he said.</p>
    <p>Some con­ser­va­tors at the HCC are branch­ing out, in­creas­ing the scope of their du­ties in ways that they find more ful­fill­ing.</p>
    <p>In the paint­ings sec­tion where three con­ser­va­tors are help­ing to</p>
    <p>pre­pare Sin­ga­pore painter Ge­or­gette Chen’s paint­ings for ex­hi­bi­tion, the ex­cel­lent state of the works has al­lowed them time to do re­search, write aca­demic es­says and form new con­clu­sions about how she fits into Sin­ga­pore’s art his­tory and her re­la­tion­ship with other artists.</p>
    <p>Con­ser­va­tor Maria Del Mar Cusso Solana, 44, said: “We are writ­ing an ar­ti­cle and it is very ex­cit­ing. There is al­ways more and more to do.”</p>
    <p>Ms Ong said her job in the com­ing years is to ce­ment Sin­ga­pore’s po­si­tion as the leader in the field in South-east Asia.</p>
    <p>Just last year, the HCC held its first in­ter­na­tional con­fer­ence, with 300 par­tic­i­pants from Asia and Europe. With the right re­sources and sup­port, more of th­ese sem­i­nars could be ar­ranged, she said.</p>
    <p>“We can share our knowl­edge and ex­per­tise with pro­fes­sion­als in South-east Asia,” said Ms Ong. “We want to reach out and build our lead­er­ship and col­lec­tion.”</p>
    <p>KEEP­ING HIS­TORY IN­TACT</p>
    <p>Not ev­ery­thing that’s dirty needs to be cleaned. Not ev­ery­thing that’s bro­ken needs to be stitched back to­gether... We want to make sure what we do is re­versible and that it is all recorded and not hid­den. It could change the ob­ject’s sig­nif­i­cance, its value and what is im­por­tant about it.</p>
