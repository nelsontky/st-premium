    <p>Okay, ad­mit it. How many of you ex­pected a re­peat of Sil­ver­stone last week, with Max Ver­stap­pen and Red Bull leav­ing Lewis Hamil­ton and Valt­teri Bot­tas blis­ter­ing their Pirelli tyres try­ing to keep pace in an ex­cru­ci­at­ingly hot Span­ish Grand Prix on Sun­day? And how many of you were thus sur­prised when Hamil­ton handed out a beat­ing of his own, not just to Ver­stap­pen but also to Bot­tas?</p>
    <p>Over the years we’ve be­come ac­cus­tomed to his bril­liance. But how did he do it on Sun­day? How did he and his team turn the ta­bles so quickly and so ef­fec­tively?</p>
    <p>Well, here’s how the drama in four parts un­folded – qual­ify on pole po­si­tion; make a per­fect start; look af­ter your tyres; cross the fin­ish line 24.177 sec­onds ahead of your clos­est ri­val.</p>
    <p>Ex­cept, of course, that it’s never that easy, just that the best can of­ten make it seem so.</p>
    <p>Hamil­ton’s 88th vic­tory – within three of Michael Schu­macher’s record – ac­tu­ally be­gan as he crossed the fin­ish line, a beaten sec­ond, at that race in Sil­ver­stone the pre­vi­ous week.</p>
    <p>In the in­ter­ven­ing days, all of</p>
    <p>Mercedes’ brain­power was fo­cused on work­ing out what they had done wrong with the set-up on his and Bot­tas’ cars, which caused their soft and medium Pirelli tyres to blis­ter when Red Bull’s didn’t.</p>
    <p>Then they worked even harder at the Cir­cuit de Catalunya on Fri­day night, to fig­ure out why the Red</p>
    <p>Bull still ap­peared to have bet­ter race pace even though the Mercedes were fastest in prac­tice.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Hamil­ton pored end­lessly over all the data, learning ex­actly what he could ex­pect of the hard, medium and soft tyres at his dis­posal. And what he needed to do to keep them alive on a cir­cuit which even with­out last weekend’s 50 deg C track tem­per­a­tures pun­ishes tyres – espe­cially the left front – and of­ten kills them be­fore they get to the cru­cial, third sec­tor. He also needed to un­der­stand why his own fa­bled tyre man­age­ment had not been able to over­come the pre­vi­ous week’s prob­lems.</p>
    <p>It was home­work, plain and sim­ple. The un­ro­man­tic side of be­ing a race driver. Then he shaded Bot­tas by a mere 0.59sec to take pole po­si­tion for the 92nd time in his ca­reer, and did in­deed make a start so per­fect that he called it “sweet”, and didn’t even have to change his line to de­fend the po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>Early on he seemed to be in con­trol as Ver­stap­pen chased and Bot­tas wore out his tyres re­cov­er­ing from an­other poor start. And as the race went on, it be­came clear that all that home­work had paid off, that Mercedes were back on their game. Well, one of them.</p>
    <p>This time, it was Ver­stap­pen moan­ing to his en­gi­neers.</p>
    <p>The other key came on the 49th lap, when Hamil­ton told his team ahead of his sec­ond pit stop not to switch him to soft tyres (on which all of the top 10 had started), but to give him a sec­ond set of medi­ums. Bot­tas had ac­cepted softs in his stop, and was strug­gling. Hamil­ton’s home­work was still pay­ing off.</p>
    <p>Again, one Mercedes driver had it right, the other didn’t. But what can Bot­tas do? He has sim­i­lar speed to Lewis at times, but that isn’t enough. Nor is ask­ing Hamil­ton’s old team­mate Nico Ros­berg for ad­vice. Nico told Valt­teri to man up, rub wheels a few times with Lewis, cook burg­ers out­side the ve­gan Lewis’ mo­torhome. Lay down mark­ers. Do any­thing to get into his head, the way he had tried – but usu­ally failed – to do.</p>
    <p>As Se­bas­tian Vet­tel is show­ing right now, even topline driv­ers can sink into psy­cho­log­i­cal mire when their plan­ets no longer align, but it’s hard to see any­one, let alone some­body fun­da­men­tally as de­cent as Bot­tas, be­ing able to win a psy­cho­log­i­cal war with the man many be­lieve to be the best there has ever been.</p>
    <p>As if dish­ing out yet an­other beat­ing to his team-mate, whom he leads by 43 points af­ter seven races, wasn’t bad enough for Bot­tas, Hamil­ton revealed that he was driv­ing in such a dif­fer­ent head space on Sun­day that he was get­ting the best feel­ings he has had in a long while, as his driv­ing flowed from lap to lap with­out mis­takes.</p>
    <p>Nei­ther Ver­stap­pen nor Bot­tas, the only re­al­is­tic chal­lengers who stand be­tween him and a record-equalling sev­enth world cham­pi­onship, are the type to give up. But deep in their hearts both prob­a­bly ac­knowl­edge that the game may al­ready be up.</p>
    <p>The other key came on the 49th lap, when Hamil­ton told his team ahead of his sec­ond pit stop not to switch him to soft tyres, but to give him a sec­ond set of medi­ums... Hamil­ton’s home­work was still pay­ing off.</p>
