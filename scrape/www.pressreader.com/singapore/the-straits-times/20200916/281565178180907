    <p>Q&AIs it pos­si­ble for a com­pany to achieve gen­der diversity in a male-dom­i­nated in­dus­try with deep-rooted stereo­types?</p>
    <p>A di­verse work­force pro­vides bet­ter rep­re­sen­ta­tion and brings more bal­anced per­spec­tives to the ta­ble. To achieve an in­clu­sive and di­verse work­force, both man­age­ment and staff must make a con­scious ef­fort to com­bat gen­der bias.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes giv­ing fair con­sid­er­a­tion to women and build­ing new paths of suc­cess for them at ev­ery op­por­tu­nity, even in tra­di­tion­ally male-dom­i­nated sec­tors like ship­ping, engi­neer­ing, and in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The Tri­par­tite Al­liance for Fair & Pro­gres­sive Employment Prac­tices (Tafep) sees gen­der diversity as a mark of a pro­gres­sive em­ployer and en­cour­ages com­pa­nies to make it a pri­or­ity in the workplace.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should also sup­port their em­ploy­ees, re­gard­less of gen­der, by pro­vid­ing them with the flex­i­bil­ity to take on more ac­tive roles at home.</p>
    <p>With greater gen­der diversity and fam­ily-friendly prac­tices, em­ploy­ers can ben­e­fit from greater in­no­va­tion and higher en­gage­ment that result from var­ied per­spec­tives in their work­force.</p>
    <p>Gen­der diversity sounds good in the­ory, but how can I ap­ply that at my workplace?</p>
    <p>Gen­der diversity at the workplace is achiev­able with com­mit­ment from both em­ploy­ers and em­ploy­ees. Em­ploy­ers can take these steps dur­ing their hir­ing process and through­out the employment jour­ney to build in­clu­sive­ness in the workplace:</p>
    <p>Re­move gen­der bias when hir­ing</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should re­view their ex­ist­ing hu­man re­source (HR) prac­tices and avoid us­ing gen­der as a se­lec­tion cri­te­rion un­less there are op­er­a­tional con­straints.</p>
    <p>In such cases, em­ploy­ers must clearly state the rea­son for these re­quire­ments.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers should also re­frain from ask­ing non-job-re­lated ques­tions per­tain­ing to gen­der or fam­ily re­spon­si­bil­i­ties dur­ing in­ter­views. In­stead, em­ploy­ers should focus on ask­ing ques­tions that al­low them to as­sess a po­ten­tial can­di­date’s abil­ity to per­form the job.</p>
    <p>Both men and women need to be treated fairly through­out their employment. This be­gins from the job re­quire­ments stated in job ad­ver­tise­ments and in­cludes key as­pects such as com­pen­sa­tion, train­ing and suc­ces­sion plan­ning.</p>
    <p>In­vest in in­clu­sive prac­tices</p>
    <p>It is cru­cial for a com­pany ’s man­age­ment team to sup­port and pro­mote in­clu­sive HR poli­cies and pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>Such pro­grammes in­clude train­ing the next gen­er­a­tion of lead­ers to proac­tively iden­tify and re­move any un­con­scious gen­der bias, as well as to ad­dress any lack of gen­der diversity.</p>
    <p>Com­pa­nies can also adopt the Tri­par­tite Stan­dards to sig­nal to em­ploy­ees and job­seek­ers their com­mit­ment in pro­vid­ing fair op­por­tu­ni­ties for ev­ery­one. ploy­ment Prac­tices states that em­ploy­ees should be as­sessed on the ba­sis of merit and that em­ploy­ers should con­duct reg­u­lar and con­struc­tive per­for­mance re­views, which can help ev­ery­one to im­prove their per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Tafep en­cour­ages em­ploy­ers to speak reg­u­larly with em­ploy­ees who have new fam­ily re­spon­si­bil­i­ties to un­der­stand their needs and work out suitable flex­i­ble work ar­range­ments, rather than mak­ing uni­lat­eral changes in al­lo­cat­ing work .</p>
    <p>A cul­ture of open­ness at the workplace where em­ploy­ees can ini­ti­ate con­ver­sa­tions is im­por­tant in fa­cil­i­tat­ing two-way com­mu­ni­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>While you could mean well, em­ploy­ers should not as­sume that preg­nant em­ploy­ees or those with care­giv­ing re­spon­si­bil­i­ties would be un­able to cope as be­fore. With sup­port from em­ploy­ers, em­ploy­ees can con­tinue to con­trib­ute ac­tively at the workplace.</p>
    <p>I wish to lighten the work­load of one of my em­ploy­ees who has just in­formed me about her preg­nancy as I am con­cerned that she might not be able to cope. How­ever I’m wor­ried that she might mis­un­der­stand that as a form of dis­crim­i­na­tion. How can I be a sup­port­ive em­ployer to­wards my preg­nant em­ployee?
