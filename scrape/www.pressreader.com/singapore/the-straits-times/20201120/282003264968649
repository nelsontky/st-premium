    <p>L. Rafael Reif, pres­i­dent of the Mas­sachusetts In­sti­tute of Tech­nol­ogy (MIT), de­liv­ered an in­tel­lec­tual call to arms to the univer­sity’s fac­ulty in Novem­ber 2017: Help gen­er­ate in­sights into how ad­vanc­ing tech­nol­ogy has changed and will change the work­force, and what poli­cies would cre­ate op­por­tu­nity for more Amer­i­cans in the dig­i­tal econ­omy.</p>
    <p>That is­sue, he wrote, is the “defin­ing chal­lenge of our time”.</p>
    <p>Three years later, the task force as­sem­bled to ad­dress it is pub­lish­ing its wide-rang­ing con­clu­sions.</p>
    <p>The 92-page re­port, “The work of the fu­ture: Build­ing bet­ter jobs in an age of in­tel­li­gent ma­chines”, was re­leased this week.</p>
    <p>The group is made up of MIT pro­fes­sors and grad­u­ate stu­dents, re­searchers from other uni­ver­si­ties, and an ad­vi­sory board of cor­po­rate ex­ec­u­tives, gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials, ed­u­ca­tors and labour lead­ers.</p>
    <p>In an ex­traor­di­nar­ily com­pre­hen­sive ef­fort, they in­cluded labour mar­ket anal­y­sis, field stud­ies and pol­icy sug­ges­tions for changes in skills-train­ing pro­grammes, the tax code, labour laws and min­i­mum-wage rates. Here are four of the key find­ings in the re­port:</p>
    <p>1</p>
    <p>MOST AMER­I­CAN WORKERS HAVE FARED POORLY</p>
    <p>It is well known that those on the top rungs of the job lad­der have pros­pered for decades while wages for av­er­age Amer­i­can workers have stag­nated. But the MIT anal­y­sis goes fur­ther. It found, for ex­am­ple, that real wages for men with­out four-year college de­grees have de­clined 10 per cent to 20 per cent since their peak in 1980. (Two-thirds of Amer­i­can workers do not have four-year college de­grees.)</p>
    <p>The US econ­omy pro­duces larger wage gaps, pro­por­tion­ately fewer high-qual­ity jobs and less in­ter­gen­er­a­tional mo­bil­ity than most other de­vel­oped na­tions do, the re­searchers found. And Amer­ica does not seem to get a com­pen­sat­ing pay­off in growth. “The US is get­ting a low ‘re­turn’ on its in­equal­ity,” the re­port said.</p>
    <p>Nor does the lag­ging po­si­tion of Amer­i­can workers ap­pear to be the re­sult of tech­nol­ogy. “It’s not that we have bet­ter tech­nol­ogy, au­tomat­ing more mid­dle-wage jobs,” said Pro­fes­sor David Au­tor, an MIT labour econ­o­mist and a co-author of the re­port. “We have worse in­sti­tu­tions.”</p>
    <p>2</p>
    <p>RO­BOTS, AI ARE NOT ABOUT TO DE­LIVER A JOB­LESS FU­TURE</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy has al­ways re­placed some jobs, cre­ated new ones and changed oth­ers. The ques­tion is whether things will be dif­fer­ent this time as ro­bots and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence (AI) quickly take over from hu­mans on fac­tory floors and in of­fices.</p>
    <p>The MIT re­searchers con­cluded that the change would be more evo­lu­tion­ary than revo­lu­tion­ary.</p>
    <p>In fact, they wrote, “we an­tic­i­pate that in the next two decades, in­dus­tri­alised coun­tries will have more job open­ings than workers to fill them”. That judg­ment is in­formed by field research in sev­eral in­dus­tries and sec­tors in­clud­ing in­sur­ance, health­care, driver­less ve­hi­cles, lo­gis­tics and ware­houses, ad­vanced man­u­fac­tur­ing, and small and medium-sized man­u­fac­tur­ers.</p>
    <p>For self-driv­ing cars and trucks, the MIT re­searchers con­cluded that wide­spread use was still a decade or more away. In ware­houses, Ama­zon has made great strides with au­to­mated con­veyance sys­tems and some ro­bot­ics, but its ware­houses run on hu­man labour, and will for years.</p>
    <p>De­spite ad­vances, ro­bots sim­ply don’t have the flex­i­bil­ity and dex­ter­ity of hu­man workers. To­day’s ro­bots learn from data and rep­e­ti­tion. They can be re­mark­ably adept at a cer­tain task, but only that one.</p>
    <p>The re­port cited a fine-tuned grip­ping ro­bot that could pluck a glazed dough­nut and care­fully place it in a box, with its shiny glaze undis­turbed. “But that grip­per only works on dough­nuts,” the re­port said. “It can’t pick up a clump of as­para­gus or a car tyre.”</p>
    <p>The cost and op­er­a­tional ex­per­tise re­quired will also slow the wide­spread adop­tion of ro­bots. A research team sur­veyed dozens of small and medium-sized man­u­fac­tur­ers in Mas­sachusetts, Ohio and Ari­zona, and found “very few ro­bots any­where”. (Small and medium-sized com­pa­nies, with fewer than 500 workers, ac­count for 98 per cent of the na­tion’s man­u­fac­tur­ing firms and 43 per cent of man­u­fac­tur­ing em­ploy­ment.)</p>
    <p>3</p>
    <p>WORKER TRAIN­ING IN AMER­ICA NEEDS TO MATCH THE MAR­KET</p>
    <p>“The key in­gre­di­ent for suc­cess is pub­lic-pri­vate part­ner­ships,” said Dr An­nette Parker, pres­i­dent of South Cen­tral College, a com­mu­nity college in Min­nesota, and a mem­ber of the ad­vi­sory board of the MIT project. The schools, non­prof­its and cor­po­rate-spon­sored pro­grammes that have suc­ceeded in lift­ing peo­ple into mid­dle-class jobs all echo her point: the need to link skills train­ing to busi­ness de­mand.</p>
    <p>Dr Parker points to the devel­op­ment of the hybrid field of “mecha­tron­ics”, which com­bines ba­sic me­chan­i­cal, elec­tron­ics and dig­i­tal skills for main­tain­ing mod­ern ma­chin­ery. Salaries go up to US$80,000 (S$107,500), she said, adding that “every­body who is au­tomat­ing needs them”.</p>
    <p>The re­port points to suc­cess­ful pro­grammes that of­fer al­ter­na­tive paths to ed­u­ca­tion and skills train­ing. IBM cre­ated a pro­gramme, P-Tech, that com­bines high school, com­mu­nity college and work ex­pe­ri­ence with IBM and many other com­pa­nies. The six-year pro­gramme is geared to sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy fields, and to stu­dents from un­der-served com­mu­ni­ties. Be­gun in 2011, the pro­gramme is now in more than 160 schools in Amer­ica.</p>
    <p>“Tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies have an obli­ga­tion to help re­spon­si­bly prepare so­ci­ety for these higher-skill jobs,” said IBM ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Ginni Rometty, who is a mem­ber of the MIT ad­vi­sory board.</p>
    <p>Google has a lead­ing tech­nol­ogy cer­tifi­cate pro­gramme. The on­line course typ­i­cally takes three to six months, and grad­u­ates get a Google IT sup­port pro­fes­sional cer­tifi­cate. More than 50 com­pa­nies have pledged to recog­nise the Google cer­tifi­cate when hir­ing tech­nol­ogy sup­port staff. The pro­gramme is the most pop­u­lar cer­tifi­cate course on Cours­era, the on­line learn­ing network.</p>
    <p>The re­port rec­om­mends an em­ployer train­ing tax credit, sim­i­lar to the cur­rent research and devel­op­ment tax credit, that can be ap­plied only to in­dus­tryrecog­nised cer­ti­fi­ca­tions. There are a hand­ful of non­profit job-train­ing pro­grammes with proven track records, in­clud­ing Year Up, Per Scholas, Project Quest and JVS.</p>
    <p>The MIT group sug­gests mak­ing fed­eral grants avail­able to such non-college train­ing and job pro­grammes. But those non­profit ven­tures are still small, reach­ing tens of thou­sands a year in to­tal. By con­trast, the na­tion’s 1,100 com­mu­nity col­leges serve mil­lions of stu­dents. The re­port calls them “the linch­pin to Amer­ica’s train­ing ecosys­tem”, and rec­om­mends in­creas­ing gov­ern­ment fund­ing, with sup­port linked to adopt­ing best prac­tices and plac­ing stu­dents in good-pay­ing jobs.</p>
    <p>4</p>
    <p>WORKERS NEED MORE POWER, VOICE AND REP­RE­SEN­TA­TION</p>
    <p>The re­port calls for rais­ing the min­i­mum wage, broad­en­ing un­em­ploy­ment in­sur­ance and mod­i­fy­ing labour laws to en­able col­lec­tive bar­gain­ing in oc­cu­pa­tions like do­mes­tic and home-care workers and free­lance workers. Such rep­re­sen­ta­tion, the re­port notes, could come from tra­di­tional unions or worker ad­vo­cacy groups like the Na­tional Do­mes­tic Workers Al­liance, Jobs With Jus­tice and the Free­lancers Union. The MIT re­searchers also rec­om­mend changes to tax laws that favour cor­po­rate spend­ing on ma­chines rather than workers.</p>
