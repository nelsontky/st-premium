You are heading in the right direction though it may feel as if you are going backwards. You just need some downtime, so go on home. Taurus (April 20 - May 20)
Take care of little things around the home – you have a domestic glow that will not go away. Make sure that you are sharing the burden though. Gemini (May 21 - June 20)
You need to figure out how to adapt to this new situation. You definitely cannot run away. Try to get advice from a parent or family member. Cancer (June 21 - July 22)
What do you want to do today? It is all about you, even if there are other demands on your time, so make sure you are focused on personal needs. Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)
You have to maintain a tight control over your emotions. Things are getting crazy, but your sanity is rock solid. Things will settle down soon. Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)
It is a good time to trade favours as most of your people are willing to admit that they are all part of a big interdepen­dent network. Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)
Your flexible nature comes into play. You may find your mental energy incredibly useful as you find new ways to handle issues. Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)
Your energy feels dominant, but that should give you the chance to walk away from whatever you have been trying to control. Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) You and your partner are mismatched, but it is not necessaril­y a sign of anything major. You just need to ride it out. Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) Someone lets loose with a stinging rebuke that may make you feel like fighting back, but stand down. You may be the only calm head today. Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18) Today is all about physical fitness and improving your physical energy. So form a plan and stick to it. C: Children; CA: Current Affairs;

Let your emotions run rampant. You may feel a surge of positive energy that carries you away, but even the darker stuff is valuable. CNA AM PM AM Singapore Tonight
