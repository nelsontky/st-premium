    <p>In the months of the cir­cuit breaker, when din­ing in was not al­lowed and most people were cooped up at home, Sin­ga­porean Reg­gie Ng, 34, made at least four new friends.</p>
    <p>The youth worker with a non­profit or­gan­i­sa­tion had wanted to ex­pand his social cir­cle.</p>
    <p>He par­tic­i­pated in two on­line neigh­bour­hood gath­er­ings or­gan­ised by Friend­zone, a ground-up ini­tia­tive un­der the Singapore Kind­ness Move­ment that is ded­i­cated to fos­ter­ing a cul­ture of con­nect­ed­ness and care.</p>
    <p>On April 26 and May 16, Mr Ng, a MacPher­son res­i­dent, got to know other youth liv­ing in sur­round­ing ar­eas, such as Alju­nied, Seran­goon and Hougang, through the ses­sions, each of which lasted about 11/</p>
    <p>2 hours and had about 25 at­ten­dees.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the gath­er­ings, par­tic­i­pants an­swered ice-breaker ques­tions and spoke about their per­sonal hob­bies and in­ter­ests, as well as in­ter­est­ing lo­ca­tions in their neigh­bour­hoods, such as the best food joints. They also had a chance to share their thoughts about Covid-19 and how the pan­demic had af­fected them.</p>
    <p>Mr Ng found the video con­ver­sa­tions fun and mean­ing­ful. He says: “In your 30s, it is hard to meet new friends, es­pe­cially dur­ing a time when ev­ery­one is sup­posed to be so­cially dis­tant. I was glad to hear from other at­ten­dees who were also go­ing through iso­la­tion and worry brought on by the coron­avirus. It made me feel more con­nected and less alone.”</p>
    <p>Af­ter the ses­sions, the at­ten­dees were added to a Tele­gram group where they con­tin­ued chat­ting. Some even took the ini­tia­tive to or­gan­ise more get-to­geth­ers.</p>
    <p>On May 2, Mr Ng at­tended a games night con­ducted over Zoom, dur­ing which at­ten­dees played party games such as Co­de­names, where two teams race to guess all the codes as­signed to them.</p>
    <p>On Nov 16, he had din­ner with four other at­ten­dees at a Lau Wang Clay­pot De­lights out­let in Seran­goon.</p>
    <p>He says: “Meet­ing in per­son for the first time will al­ways feel slightly un­fa­mil­iar. But over din­ner, we chat­ted and loos­ened up.</p>
    <p>“I learnt that one man could speak five languages, in­clud­ing Span­ish, and was im­pressed to know that he was mo­ti­vated to learn th­ese languages so he could con­nect with people from other cul­tures.</p>
    <p>“One woman, a fi­nan­cial plan­ner, also re­vealed that she had ini­tially planned to be an ac­tress, but faced ob­sta­cles and parental ob­jec­tion. I was moved by how re­silient she was de­spite the chal­lenges she faced.</p>
    <p>“It was great to be­come friends with them. With time, per­haps our friend­ship can de­velop fur­ther.”</p>
    <p>Full-time na­tional ser­vice­man Ad­win Ang, 20, and his girl­friend, stu­dent Althea Isis Giron, 19, also par­tic­i­pated in a Friend­zone on­line gath­er­ing with res­i­dents from Marine Pa­rade on May 17.</p>
    <p>Through the ses­sion, Mr Ang, who had stud­ied in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy at a poly­tech­nic, be­friended a com­puter-science univer­sity stu­dent who shared his in­ter­est in tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>They be­gan ex­chang­ing in­sights and ex­pe­ri­ences on tech-re­lated top­ics such as ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and Google Cloud, as well as in­form­ing each other about cour­ses they could join on on­line learn­ing provider Cours­era.</p>
    <p>Mr Ang says: “Although we have never met in per­son, we be­came study bud­dies and I am quite happy that he was there for me to bounce ideas off and im­prove our tech knowl­edge and skills. With­out him, try­ing to do so on my own could have been very bor­ing and lonely.”</p>
