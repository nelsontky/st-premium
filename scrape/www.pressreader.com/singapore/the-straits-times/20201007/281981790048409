    <p>•</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Roger Pen­rose of Bri­tain, Pro­fes­sor Rein­hard Gen­zel of Ger­many and Pro­fes­sor An­drea Ghez of the United States have won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their re­search i nto black holes, the Nobel jury said.</p>
    <p>The physi­cists were se­lected “for their dis­cov­er­ies about one of the most ex­otic phe­nom­ena in the uni­verse, the black hole”, the Nobel com­mit­tee said.</p>
    <p>Prof Pen­rose, 89, was hon­oured for show­ing “that the gen­eral the­ory of relativity leads to the for­ma­tion of black holes”, while Prof Gen­zel, 68, and Prof Ghez, 55, were jointly awarded for dis­cov­er­ing “that an in­vis­i­ble and ex­tremely heavy ob­ject gov­erns the or­bits of stars at the cen­tre of our gal­axy”, the jury said.</p>
    <p>Prof Ghez is only the fourth woman to re­ceive the physics prize since 1901, when the first Nobel prizes were handed out.</p>
    <p>Prof Pen­rose used math­e­mat­i­cal mod­el­ling to prove in 1965 that black holes can form and be­come an en­tity from which noth­ing, not even light, may es­cape.</p>
    <p>Prof Gen­zel and Prof Ghez have led re­search since the early 1990s fo­cus­ing on a re­gion called Sagittariu­s A* at the cen­tre of the Milky Way.</p>
    <p>Us­ing the world’s largest te­le­scopes, they dis­cov­ered an ex­tremely heavy, in­vis­i­ble ob­ject – around four mil­lion times greater than the mass of our Sun – that pulls on sur­round­ing stars, giv­ing our gal­axy its char­ac­ter­is­tic swirl.</p>
    <p>The trio will share the prize sum of 10 mil­lion Swedish kro­nor (S$1.5 mil­lion), with half go­ing to Prof Pen­rose and the other half jointly to Prof Gen­zel and Prof Ghez.</p>
    <p>The in-per­son award cer­e­mony on Dec 10 has been can­celled ow­ing to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and re­placed with a tele­vised cer­e­mony show­ing the lau­re­ates re­ceiv­ing their awards in their home coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Last year, the hon­our went to Cana­dian-Amer­i­can cos­mol­o­gist James Pee­bles and Swiss astronomer­s Michel Mayor and Di­dier Queloz for re­search that in­creased the un­der­stand­ing of our place in the uni­verse.</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Emer­i­tus Pee­bles won for show­ing that most of the uni­verse is made up of an “un­known dark mat­ter and dark en­ergy”, while Pro­fes­sor Emer­i­tus Mayor and Pro­fes­sor Queloz won for the first dis­cov­ery of an ex­o­planet out­side our so­lar sys­tem.</p>
    <p>This year’s Nobel sea­son kicked off on Mon­day, with the medicine prize go­ing to Amer­i­cans Har­vey Al­ter and Charles Rice, to­gether with Bri­ton Michael Houghton, for the dis­cov­ery of the hep­ati­tis C virus that paved the way for a cure.</p>
