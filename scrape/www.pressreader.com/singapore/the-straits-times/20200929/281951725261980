    <p>Nurs­ing homes and hos­pices are beef­ing up their dig­i­tal and phys­i­cal in­fras­truc­ture to help ease the lone­li­ness and frus­tra­tion of se­niors so­cially iso­lated amid the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In Pasir Ris, Apex Har­mony Lodge, which cares for de­men­tia pa­tients, has tested a new ap­proach called Na­maste Care, which in­volves giv­ing res­i­dents gen­tle mas­sages and man­i­cures, and us­ing aro­mather­apy oils and coloured lights to stim­u­late their dif­fer­ent senses.</p>
    <p>The pi­lot, which in­volved three res­i­dents in March, was suc­cess­ful, said Apex Har­mony chief ex­ec­u­tive Soh Mee Chu.</p>
    <p>Safe dis­tanc­ing mea­sures mean vis­its from fam­ily mem­bers are less fre­quent, and pa­tients with se­vere cog­ni­tive im­pair­ments are un­able to con­nect vir­tu­ally with fam­ily mem­bers and are thus less stim­u­lated. This ap­proach will help them to re­lax, said Ms Soh.</p>
    <p>Apex Har­mony staff nurse Karl Zamora said the pro­gramme has helped el­derly res­i­dents sleep bet­ter, and re­duced in­ci­dents of shout­ing and ag­gres­sive be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Madam Ang Sew Chu, 95, who has been a res­i­dent at the lodge for many years, goes for Na­maste Care ses­sions about three times a week.</p>
    <p>Ms Zamora said she is now more alert, able to com­mu­ni­cate through sounds and sleeps through the night.</p>
    <p>The lodge plans to roll out the project to 60 res­i­dents, up from 30 now, as more staff have been trained in it, said Ms Soh.</p>
    <p>The fund­ing for the pro­gramme’s ex­pan­sion is pro­vided by the Lien Foun­da­tion, which has helped other char­i­ties and or­gan­i­sa­tions with fi­nan­cial sup­port dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>All in, it has com­mit­ted $3.28 mil­lion in two tranches to 18 so­cial ser­vice agen­cies and three hos­pi­tals un­der its Char­i­ta­ble Or­gan­i­sa­tions Vi­tal In Down­turn (Covid) Fund.</p>
    <p>Lien Foun­da­tion chief ex­ec­u­tive Lee Poh Wah said: “Many of the dis­rup­tions and dif­fi­cul­ties that have sur­faced amid the pan­demic are se­vere and unan­tic­i­pated for our sec­tor and grantee part­ners.”</p>
    <p>The ser­vices pro­vided by the Lien Foun­da­tion are a key part of Sin­ga­pore’s so­cial safety net, said Mr Lee, adding that the foun­da­tion had an­tic­i­pated pain on the hori­zon for many char­i­ties.</p>
    <p>In April, it gave $1.2 mil­lion to 18 so­cial ser­vice agen­cies with no con­di­tions at­tached on how the money must be used. This was to give agen</p>
    <p>cies the free­dom and flex­i­bil­ity to quickly re­spond to the cri­sis.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond tranche of funds, awarded this month, aims to help char­ity or­gan­i­sa­tions seed new pro­grammes and test-bed so­lu­tions to meet chang­ing needs as they trans­form and adapt to a “new nor­mal”.</p>
    <p>Agen­cies have been given funds of up to $100,000 each, and most of them are us­ing the money to adopt dig­i­tal so­lu­tions, said Mr Lee.</p>
    <p>An­other or­gan­i­sa­tion re­ceiv­ing fund­ing from the Lien Foun­da­tion is HCA Hos­pice Care, which or­gan­ised a “make-be­lieve out­ing” for pa­tients at its Seran­goon day hos­pice in June.</p>
    <p>Many of the se­nior cit­i­zens had never been on a plane be­fore, so the hos­pice de­cided to cre­ate the expe</p>
    <p>ri­ence for them – from check­ing in and board­ing a plane to watch­ing in-flight en­ter­tain­ment, dis­em­bark­ing and go­ing through im­mi­gra­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Antony Lee, who is HCA’s as­sis­tant day hos­pice cen­tre man­ager, said one pa­tient told him he was over­joyed with the ex­pe­ri­ence and had “no re­grets”.</p>
    <p>The hos­pice plans to roll out a dig­i­tal plat­form for its vol­un­teers us­ing the fund­ing from Lien Foun­da­tion, so they can bet­ter en­gage with their pa­tients through vir­tual be­friend­ing. The hos­pice’s com­mu­ni­ca­tions man­ager Jemin Chua said HCA also hopes to use the plat­form to bring the make-be­lieve out­ings to the next level, such as hav­ing vol­un­teers pro­vide live trans­la­tion for the pa­tients, some of whom do not</p>
    <p>speak English – the lan­guage ses­sions are usu­ally con­ducted in.</p>
    <p>The Sal­va­tion Army Peace­haven Nurs­ing Home is an­other Lien Foun­da­tion ben­e­fi­ciary that will use the funds to up­grade it­self.</p>
    <p>Last Novem­ber, it launched for its res­i­dents a life­style club called the Jade Cir­cle Arena on its premises, but due to the Covid-19 pan­demic, res­i­dents have not been able to use it as reg­u­larly.</p>
    <p>Peace­haven ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Low Mui Lang said the home plans to have three smaller are­nas by the end of Novem­ber, fea­tur­ing new ma­chines with old-school games so that life still goes on for the res­i­dents and they can have fun.</p>
