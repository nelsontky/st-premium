    <p>There is good news and bad news for traders in Gey­lang.</p>
    <p>Shop­pers have re­turned since phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s re­open­ing, but not in suf­fi­cient num­bers, with sales a far cry from that of pre-Covid-19 days.</p>
    <p>Busi­ness own­ers at Joo Chiat Com­plex and Tan­jong Ka­tong Com­plex told Malay-lan­guage daily Berita Harian on Sun­day that reg­u­la­tions con­strain­ing func­tions such as weddings and fes­ti­vals were among the rea­sons for the low foot­fall in the area.</p>
    <p>Mr Huang Jian­hui, 36, man­ag­ing part­ner of Bewa Fash­ion, said sales for its ready-to-wear cloth­ing and sewing ser­vices have fallen by about 50 per cent com­pared with the same month last year.</p>
    <p>Like a num­ber of busi­nesses at the two cen­tres, Bewa Fash­ion has taken to in­tro­duc­ing new lines to boost sales.</p>
    <p>At the be­gin­ning of phase two, it started sell­ing re­us­able masks with lace and satin lin­ing.</p>
    <p>The masks re­ceived pos­i­tive re­sponse from walk-in cus­tomers and on­line.</p>
    <p>“Mask sales help sup­port weak sales of our cloth­ing. We are in­vest­ing more time and en­ergy in de­sign­ing new masks in the short term,” Mr Huang said.</p>
    <p>He added that the cur­rent mea­sures, which re­strict peo­ple com­ing to­gether for func­tions such as weddings, meant that there was less de­mand for cus­tom cloth­ing and tai­lor­ing.</p>
    <p>An­other store, Bimla, has turned to pro­mo­tions to at­tract cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>Joo Chiat Com­plex, which is usu­ally crowded dur­ing the week­ends, has been un­usu­ally quiet dur­ing the pan­demic. At Tan­jong Ka­tong Com­plex, the num­ber of cus­tomers vis­it­ing the mall has re­port­edly de­clined by about 60 per cent.</p>
    <p>Shop­keep­ers in­ter­viewed by Berita Harian said that un­less the sit­u­a­tion changes, it would be dif­fi­cult to main­tain their busi­nesses.</p>
    <p>Mr Awie Sho­hod, 60, who runs Adam’s Bar­ber­shop at Tan­jong Ka­tong Com­plex, said: “There are some busi­nesses here that can­not sur­vive and even­tu­ally have to close. It will be dif­fi­cult for us to get cus­tomers all day.”</p>
