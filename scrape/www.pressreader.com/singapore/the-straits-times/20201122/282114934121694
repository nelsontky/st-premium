    <p>BAN­GA­LORE • Re­turn­ing to my home town, Ban­ga­lore, in 2013 af­ter years away, I took to read­ing the city pages of the news­pa­per like I was watch­ing a hor­ror movie. One eye shut tight in fear, ready to bolt, my heart pound­ing. Ev­ery few weeks, as if pos­sessed, the city cor­po­ra­tion was hack­ing down 100-year-old rain­trees and slic­ing away green lungs.</p>
    <p>I was not para­noid.</p>
    <p>Be­tween the 1970s and 2017, paved sur­faces grew a hun­dred times in Ban­ga­lore – once known as the Gar­den City of In­dia. Green sur­faces dropped from 68 per cent of the city in 1973 to 20 per cent to­day. There is only one tree for ev­ery seven per­sons now.</p>
    <p>Doc­tors have long said the city is un­suit­able for those with re­s­pi­ra­tory ail­ments. My mother moved out in 2017 to give her wheez­ing lungs a rest.</p>
    <p>In Fe­bru­ary that year, I joined more than a thou­sand Ban­ga­lore­ans in a hu­man chain around 112 trees in Jayama­hal Road, known for its great canopy and sud­den drop in tem­per­a­ture, that were slated to be re­moved for devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>There were clever slo­gans as well as noise and right­eous anger. Ex­perts of­fered sci­en­tific, sus­tain­able al­ter­na­tives. Teenagers painted Don’t Cut Me on the trees.</p>
    <p>We went home with hope in 2017, and the cor­po­ra­tion shelved its plan.</p>
    <p>But this year, the pro­posal is back. This time, 225 trees are marked for the chop. Res­i­dents are plan­ning loud ob­jec­tions in the next few months.</p>
    <p>While some bat­tle to save ex­ist­ing trees, in the past few years, oth­ers have been zeal­ously plant­ing new ones that will be hard to up­root.</p>
    <p>To off­set ex­pand­ing in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy parks and apart­ment com­plexes re­plac­ing lake beds, padi farms and dense green hillocks, cit­i­zen groups, non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tions and a hand­ful of af­foresta­tion com­pa­nies are creat­ing ur­ban forests.</p>
    <p>Since space is scarce, most are us­ing a method in­vented by Ja­panese botanist Akira Miyawaki in the 1960s.</p>
    <p>The Miyawaki tech­nique tries to make the most of lim­ited space, so dozens of na­tive species are planted close to one an­other, ran­domly. The plants re­ceive sun­light only from the top, and grow up­wards rather than side­ways.</p>
    <p>Along the high­way to the Ban­ga­lore air­port, one such for­est stands like a drink of cool wa­ter. In this 0.4ha is­land amid a scorch­ing con­crete desert, trees stretch to­wards the sky, glossy leaves quiv­er­ing in the breeze and flow­ers and fruit grow­ing un­tu­tored.</p>
    <p>Gar­den­ers em­ployed by the air­port visit the green patch to have their lunch in its cool shade. Em­ploy­ees walk in it for undis­turbed chats.</p>
    <p>This tiny and tight-as-a-fist for­est came up on bar­ren, dusty land. It was planted in six months, then tended to for two years. It can thrive on its own now – with­out wa­ter­ing, prun­ing or weed­ing – for at least 100 years.</p>
    <p>Ban­ga­lore-based com­pany Af­forestt, awarded a con­tract from air­port con­struc­tion com­pany GMR, planted it in 2018.</p>
    <p>Af­forestt founder Shub­hendu Sharma and his small team of 20 dug pits, added mi­crobes and cre­ated mois­ture.</p>
    <p>They planted thousands of saplings of na­tive trees, shrubs and bushes that would grow to four dif­fer­ent heights.</p>
    <p>For two years, Af­forestt propped the soft-stemmed young trees with bam­boo, wa­tered the plants and added worms and com­post. Then, they left the patch alone.</p>
    <p>To­day, the air­port gar­den is a self-sus­tain­ing plan­ta­tion. It is im­pen­e­tra­ble.</p>
    <p>Di­rect sun­light barely reaches the ground. Leaves fall and cre­ate mulch, re­tain­ing soil mois­ture.</p>
    <p>“The Miyawaki method en­sures that plant growth is 10 times faster and the for­est is 30 times denser than usual. Only na­tive plants are used, so they can be in har­mony, and in a few years, they at­tract bio­di­ver­sity, lo­cal birds and squir­rels,” said Af­forestt’s site su­per­vi­sor Ir­fan Ahmed.</p>
    <p>Mr Sharma first heard of the method at a 2008 lec­ture by Dr Miyawaki at Toy­ota Ban­ga­lore, where he worked as an en­gi­neer. Six months later, he vol­un­teered with Dr Miyawaki’s team to cre­ate a for­est on the car man­u­fac­tur­ing cam­pus.</p>
    <p>“We made a car ev­ery three min­utes in Toy­ota. I thought, does the world need so many cars? Th­ese things in­dus­tries man­u­fac­ture will de­te­ri­o­rate as they age. But I re­alised that forests, once cre­ated and left even for 200 years, will get only more com­plex and beau­ti­ful,” said Mr Sharma.</p>
    <p>In 2011, he set up Af­forestt. The com­pany has since cre­ated 138 forests in 44 cities in five coun­tries, in­clud­ing a 200 sq m rain­for­est for Te­masek at the Sin­ga­pore Zoo as a case study for the up­com­ing Mandai na­ture precinct.</p>
    <p>“The bril­liance of the Miyawaki method is that it can cre­ate a for­est even in 20 sq ft (of space). In cities with shrink­ing space, isn’t that just what we need?” he said.</p>
    <p>While Af­forestt has paid staff, SayTrees, a Ban­ga­lore non-profit or­gan­i­sa­tion, has worked with cit­i­zen groups to plant 27 Miyawaki forests in the city.</p>
    <p>Mr Kapil Sharma, who founded SayTrees, grew up in blaz­ing Raipur, a coal-min­ing hub in cen­tral In­dia, and moved to Ban­ga­lore in 2001 to study soft­ware en­gi­neer­ing. By the time he grad­u­ated, the south­ern city was hot­ter, greyer and drier.</p>
    <p>He be­gan to plant saplings along roads, invit­ing bik­ers’ clubs and photograph­y groups to join him.</p>
    <p>In 2011, he founded the non-profit en­tity, which by 2016 also be­gan to cre­ate Miyawaki forests. They have since cre­ated forests in park zones, govern­ment waste­land, res­i­den­tial es­tates and school cam­puses.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, they re­ceive calls from res­i­dents like Mrs Malathi Prasad, 55, a for­mer man­ager at an elec­tron­ics man­u­fac­turer, now an avid gar­dener who lives in Many­ata Res­i­dency, a new hous­ing es­tate ad­ja­cent to a steel-and-glass tech park.</p>
    <p>“Fif­teen of us sug­gested to other res­i­dents that we build mini-forests in­stead of parks. But peo­ple were very di­vided – they wanted the usual paved walk­ways and chil­dren’s play area. Fi­nally, we agreed to al­lot half the park area for forests,” said Mrs Prasad.</p>
    <p>SayTrees found cor­po­ra­tions to fund the forest­ing, and, with 15 res­i­dents, planted more than 12,600 na­tive saplings in five patches. A year in, the trees are about 6.1m tall, and will reach 10.7m in five years.</p>
    <p>When work­ers tried to cut trees in one of Many­ata Res­i­dency’s forests for a govern­ment-run milk par­lour, res­i­dents pro­duced doc­u­ments show­ing it was a green zone and fought with mu­nic­i­pal­ity of­fi­cials.</p>
    <p>Per­haps it is this tenac­ity that will save my city. Mr Kapil Sharma said: “To­day, if we send out one e-mail, we eas­ily get at least 1,000 vol­un­teers. Vol­un­teer­ing not only builds forests but also a sense of own­er­ship of the city’s green cover.”</p>
