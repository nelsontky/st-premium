    <p>It takes a pan­demic to make us re­alise just how de­pen­dent we are on food im­ports. Al­most ev­ery­thing we see in su­per­mar­kets comes from some­place else.</p>
    <p>And for a long time, be­ing a lo­ca­vore was a pipe dream. Sin­ga­pore is tiny with lit­tle land for farm­ing.</p>
    <p>How things have changed.</p>
    <p>These days, it is en­tirely pos­si­ble to put to­gether a meal us­ing pro­duce grown in one of more than 190 high-tech and tra­di­tional farms here.</p>
    <p>And if you or­der Peter Butch­ery’s Love Our Back­yard Box ($55), you will know what I mean.</p>
    <p>The box of good­ies is well-cu­rated. There are two fil­lets of fish – one of Golden Pom­fret (150 to 250g) and the other of Grey Mul­let (200 to 250g, right) – from The Fish Farmer. From Meod, a veg­etable farm, there is 150g of mizuna, a ten­der leafy Ja­panese veg­etable that is de­li­cious raw or cooked; and a 100g mesclun mix from Just Pro­duce.</p>
    <p>Slice the pom­fret, mar­i­nate quickly in shoyu, mirin and sake, then poach in stock and add the mizuna for a quick, light and pro­tein-filled meal. The mul­let I would steam and eat with por­ridge, with a dip of white vine­gar, chilli and gar­lic on the side. The mesclun would form the base of a sub­stan­tial salad with grilled prawns, toma­toes and sliced av­o­cado.</p>
    <p>As if all this is not enough, the box also comes with a 500g sour­dough loaf from BAO, or Bak­ery Ar­ti­san Orig­i­nal, which usu­ally sup­plies to other busi­nesses; and a 200g jar of Ba­con But­ter from Cure restau­rant in Keong Saik Road. Spread the but­ter lav­ishly on a slice of sour­dough toast for a de­li­cious snack.</p>
    <p>For ev­ery box or­dered, $5.50 goes to Food Bank Sin­ga­pore, whose mis­sion is to end food in­se­cu­rity in Sin­ga­pore. It is avail­able un­til Oct 31.</p>
    <p>Do good and eat well. Why not?</p>
