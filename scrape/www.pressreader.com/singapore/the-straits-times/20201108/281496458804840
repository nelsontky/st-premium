    <p>Pa­tience is key when it comes to get­ting a good real es­tate deal amid the kind of un­cer­tainty we are go­ing through now.</p>
    <p>Food and bev­er­age con­sul­tant San­dra Lim and her hus­band opted for the slow and steady ap­proach by rent­ing homes at Sen­tosa Cove be­fore they were fi­nally ready to buy.</p>
    <p>Their wait­ing game ended in 2017 when the cou­ple bought a three-storey ter­raced house on Ocean Drive for $5.08 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>The seller wasn’t so pleased, mind you. He paid $7 mil­lion for the 2,700 sq ft house in 2012, so took a hit of close to $2 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim, 38, reck­ons the price of $1,860 per square foot was a good deal: “I don’t think it can go lower than that.”</p>
    <p>She does ac­knowl­edge that the price they paid could have landed a larger, free­hold res­i­dence as op­posed to the lease­hold Sen­tosa home.</p>
    <p>“We could have bought some­thing big­ger, but I don’t think we will be happy,” said Ms Lim, who added that it was love at first sight when she first set foot on the is­land and the life­style it of­fers.</p>
    <p>Life on Sen­tosa is so re­laxed that the cou­ple did not feel any rush to move into their new home, which is still be­ing ren­o­vated, mainly be­cause this year has been lost due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>That means they are still rent­ing, pay­ing $11,000 a month for a 3,300 sq ft, sea-view pent­house at Seas­cape. “We didn’t re­ally feel a rush to move,” said Ms Lim.</p>
    <p>“We re­ally love this place. I don’t think you can find a view like this in Sin­ga­pore, any­where. And the fact that we can kayak across to St John’s Is­land and Sis­ters’ Is­lands... It’s re­ally a life­style thing.”</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said a friend will lease the pent­house unit when she and her hus­band move out.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral prop­erty agents and in­vestors The Sun­day Times spoke to said Sen­tosa homes have been a draw as more peo­ple are work­ing from home due to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Tai­wanese in­vestor Jackie Yeh, who owns 10 con­do­minium apart­ments on Sen­tosa, said all her units are leased, mostly by for­eign­ers.</p>
    <p>Ms Yeh, 50, moved to Sin­ga­pore in 1986 and owns about 20 res­i­den­tial prop­er­ties in Sin­ga­pore, Bangkok and China.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore per­ma­nent res­i­dent was one of the early birds to see Sen­tosa Cove’s po­ten­tial and she re­mains sold on the area: “Sen­tosa prop­erty yields good rental. If I sell now, what am I go­ing to in­vest in?”</p>

    <p>A VIEW LIKE NO OTHER</p>
    <p>We re­ally love this place. I don’t think you can find a view like this in Sin­ga­pore, any­where. And the fact that we can kayak across to St John’s Is­land and Sis­ters’ Is­lands... It’s re­ally a life­style thing.</p>
