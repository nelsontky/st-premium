    <p>The Sin­ga­pore court on Thurs­day sen­tenced a for­mer CGS-CIMB Se­cu­ri­ties em­ployee to 20 months and 18 weeks’ jail for her in­volve­ment in ma­nip­u­lat­ing trad­ing in the shares of Catal­ist-listed Koyo In­ter­na­tional between Au­gust 2014 and Jan­uary 2016.</p>
    <p>Lau Wan Heng, 62, ini­tially a bro­ker and later a remisier at the bro­ker­age firm, will be­gin her sen­tence on Oct 29. She was part of an al­leged mul­ti­mem­ber scheme said to have ar­ti­fi­cially pushed up the share price of Koyo – a provider of in­te­grated me­chan­i­cal and elec­tri­cal en­gi­neer­ing ser­vices – dur­ing the pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Al­leged master­mind Lin Eng Jue, 43, was in­tro­duced to Lau by the Koyo chief ex­ec­u­tive in Jan­uary 2015, and he then asked for Lau’s as­sis­tance in the scheme. Between Fe­bru­ary 2015 and Oc­to­ber 2015, Lau ap­proached and con­vinced nine clients at CGSCIMB to let her use their trad­ing ac­counts to trade Koyo shares, from Fe­bru­ary till Jan­uary 2016. She also con­vinced her brother and his wife to hand over three of their trad­ing ac­counts for the same pur­pose, though her brother ex­e­cuted the trades di­rectly.</p>
    <p>Those who pro­vided their trad­ing ac­counts were promised a com­mis­sion of 10 per cent from any prof­its made through their ac­counts, while any losses in­curred would be paid by the scheme mem­bers.</p>
    <p>Between Oc­to­ber 2015 and Jan­uary 2016, Lau ob­tained more trad­ing ac­counts to be used, af­ter in­form­ing her clients ear­lier that she was con­sid­er­ing leav­ing CGS-CIMB to join ei­ther RHB Se­cu­ri­ties or KGI Se­cu­ri­ties. This came af­ter she re­alised CGSCIMB was re­strict­ing her credit lim­its. How­ever, Lau told her clients – with the ex­cep­tion of her brother – that she was leav­ing due to “work is­sues”.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, her CGS-CIMB clients opened or re­ac­ti­vated a to­tal of 17 RHB and KGI trad­ing ac­counts. She sought help from two em­ploy­ees at the firms to carry out the trades. Her brother also handed over two more ac­counts he opened in his name to her. Even­tu­ally, Lau did not leave CGS-CIMB.</p>
    <p>Over­all, she contribute­d to 31 of the to­tal 53 trad­ing ac­counts used in the scheme.</p>
    <p>On Thurs­day, she was con­victed on one count of en­gag­ing in a course of con­duct which she knew would likely cre­ate a false or mis­lead­ing im­pres­sion of ac­tive trad­ing in the shares un­der sec­tion 197(1A)(a) of the Se­cu­ri­ties and Fu­tures Act (SFA), and 12 counts of unau­tho­rised trad­ing un­der sec­tion 201(b) of the SFA. Nine­teen other sim­i­lar charges were taken into con­sid­er­a­tion for sen­tenc­ing. Ad­di­tion­ally, as a re­sult of CGS-CIMB’s le­gal ac­tion, Lau paid the firm some $231,000 on ac­count of their losses fol­low­ing the crash in Koyo share price in Jan­uary 2016.</p>
    <p>Lau is the fourth per­son in the scheme to have been sen­tenced. Lin and three oth­ers have been charged, and their cases are on­go­ing.</p>
    <p>Koyo shares closed down 0.5 cent or 6.25 per cent at 7.5 cents on Thurs­day.</p>
