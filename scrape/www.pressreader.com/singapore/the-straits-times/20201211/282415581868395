    <p>LON­DON For­mula One and gov­ern­ing body FIA yes­ter­day joined the Haas team in con­demn­ing newly signed Rus­sian driver Nikita Mazepin for post­ing a video on so­cial me­dia of a young woman be­ing groped in a car.</p>
    <p>The In­sta­gram Sto­ries clip, which Mazepin up­loaded, was swiftly deleted and the 21-yearold has apol­o­gised for what Haas called “ab­hor­rent” be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>The woman, iden­ti­fied as model Alma del Caribe, has de­fended his ac­tions, say­ing on In­sta­gram that she has been friends with Mazepin for a long time and “noth­ing from that video was se­ri­ous at all”.</p>
    <p>How­ever, F1 and FIA said in a joint state­ment: “We strongly sup­port the Haas F1 team in its re­sponse to the re­cent in­ap­pro­pri­ate ac­tions of its driver.</p>
    <p>“This mat­ter will con­tinue to be dealt with in­ter­nally by the Haas F1 team. The eth­i­cal prin­ci­ples and di­verse and in­clu­sive cul­ture of our sport are of the ut­most im­por­tance to the FIA and For­mula One.”</p>
    <p>The i nci­dent oc­curred after two races in Bahrain and be­fore For­mula One’s sea­son-end­ing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix at the Yas Ma­rina cir­cuit this week­end.</p>
    <p>Mazepin was re­vealed last week, along­side Mick Schu­macher, son of joint-record seven-time world cham­pion Michael, as Haas’ new driver duo for next sea­son.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Mercedes have fixed a ra­dio prob­lem that caused pit-stop con­fu­sion in Bahrain last week­end and wrecked their race, team boss Toto Wolff has said.</p>
    <p>The Sil­ver Ar­rows put Valt­teri Bot­tas’ front tyres on race leader Ge­orge Rus­sell’s car when both driv­ers pit­ted dur­ing a safety car pe­riod at Sakhir.</p>
    <p>The mis­take meant that Rus­sell, stand­ing in for the Covid­stricken Lewis Hamil­ton, had to pit again. He ended up ninth after a late punc­ture dealt a fur­ther set­back, but Wolff con­firmed “we’ve put mea­sures in place... to make sure it doesn’t hap­pen again”.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to the Daily Mail, Mercedes are ready to wait un­til to­mor­row to see if Hamil­ton can be fit to take part in Abu Dhabi.</p>
    <p>The Bri­ton, who is still in self­iso­lat­ing in Bahrain, must re­turn a neg­a­tive Covid-19 test be­fore he can travel.</p>
    <p>Un­der FIA rules, Hamil­ton can be ab­sent from to­day’s two prac­tice ses­sions, but must take part in ei­ther prac­tice or qual­i­fy­ing to­mor­row to be al­lowed to par­tic­i­pate on Sun­day.</p>
