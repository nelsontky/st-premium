    <p>Myan­mar’s key op­po­si­tion Union Sol­i­dar­ity and De­vel­op­ment Party (USDP) yes­ter­day de­nounced the Nov 8 gen­eral elec­tion, claim­ing it was full of ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties.</p>
    <p>But the elec­tion com­mis­sion, in a ram­bling press con­fer­ence the same af­ter­noon, shrugged off all al­le­ga­tions as “base­less”, seem­ingly obliv­i­ous that its opac­ity was sow­ing false­hood and ag­i­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>De­spite the con­tro­versy, the writ­ing is on the wall: The USDP, which is the mil­i­tary’s proxy that ran the gov­ern­ment from 2011 to 2016, ap­pears to have lost spec­tac­u­larly to the in­cum­bent civil­ian Na­tional League for Democ­racy (NLD) party, even in its per­ceived stronghold­s.</p>
    <p>While this re­flects the USDP’s grow­ing ir­rel­e­vance, an­a­lysts say, it could also make it more dif­fi­cult to strip the mil­i­tary of the priv­i­leges it en­joys un­der the junta-drafted Con­sti­tu­tion.</p>
    <p>Pend­ing full of­fi­cial re­sults, some ma­jor trends can be gleaned: The NLD top­pled the USDP even in the lat­ter’s “safe” con­stituen­cies in re­gions such as Bago, Man­dalay and Aye­yarwady.</p>
    <p>It also bat­ted away chal­lenges from high-pro­file for­mer al­lies such as the Peo­ple’s Party’s Ko Ko Gyi and Peo­ple’s Pioneer Party’s Thet Thet Khine.</p>
    <p>NLD leader Aung San Suu Kyi has not com­mented on the re­sults, even as crowds con­vened at its Yan­gon head­quar­ters to cel­e­brate the clear signs the party has won well over the 322 seats needed to form a gov­ern­ment.</p>
    <p>Mr Soe Myint Aung, founder of the Yan­gon Cen­tre for In­de­pen­dent Re­search, said: “Out­side the eth­nic (mi­nor­ity) ar­eas, the peo­ple’s sup­port for</p>
    <p>NLD was quite as­tound­ing.”</p>
    <p>De­spite the rag­ing Covid-19 pan­demic, which has hith­erto killed more than 1,400 peo­ple in the coun­try, vot­ers de­fied ex­pec­ta­tions by form­ing long queues out­side polling sta­tions on Sun­day.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts say they were likely spooked by the mil­i­tary’s at­tempts to cast it­self as a po­lit­i­cal ar­biter, de­spite it wield­ing sig­nif­i­cant po­lit­i­cal power through its con­trol of three min­istries and a quar­ter of</p>
    <p>all Par­lia­ment seats.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, com­man­der-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing re­port­edly met politi­cians from 34 par­ties, who sought his help should the elec­tion turn out to be un­fair.</p>
    <p>The se­nior gen­eral got on his LIM­ITED AP­PEAL</p>
    <p>soap­box the week be­fore the elec­tion, re­buk­ing the elec­tion com­mis­sion for its lapses and de­mand­ing the gov­ern­ment take re­spon­si­bil­ity for its per­for­mance.</p>
    <p>Mr Soe Myint Aung said: “The elec­toral out­come re­flects the Myan­mar peo­ple’s de­ci­sive re­jec­tion of mil­i­tary guardian­ship and mil­i­tary-af­fil­i­ated par­ties.</p>
    <p>“As in pre­vi­ous elec­tions in Myan­mar, this one again looks like a ref­er­en­dum be­tween democ­racy and au­thor­i­tar­i­an­ism.”</p>
    <p>One voter from Yan­gon, 30-year-old Ma May Than­dar, put it more bluntly on Sun­day: “Peo­ple are afraid of an­other term of junta rule in our coun­try. It is im­por­tant to have a gov­ern­ment ruled by the peo­ple.”</p>
    <p>NLD pared down its man­i­festo and stuck to its script, call­ing vot­ers to sup­port its still-un­fin­ished fight against mil­i­tary dic­ta­tor­ship.</p>
    <p>Ms Suu Kyi was the charis­matic ma­tri­arch fig­ure at the cen­tre of the cam­paign, her like­ness beam­ing from pub­lic­ity ma­te­rial that some­times did not even fea­ture the NLD can­di­dates’ own pic­tures.</p>
    <p>Ms Ying Lao, the Yan­gon-based deputy di­rec­tor of Sal­ween In­sti­tute for Public Pol­icy, said: “The vot­ers didn’t even need to know who was ac­tu­ally go­ing to be rep­re­sent­ing them, as long as that per­son was from Aung San Suu Kyi’s party. That’s how it works.”</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the USDP, a dis­tant run­ner-up in the last elec­tion, was stuck in its groove.</p>
    <p>Mr Soe Myint Aung said: “It was un­able to make it­self more ap­peal­ing to the public. It was play­ing mostly with the idea of ethno-re­li­gious na­tion­al­ism, and the need to pro­tect Myan­mar from for­eign in­ter­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>“But it didn’t re­alise that this mes­sage had lim­ited ap­peal with the ma­jor­ity of the pop­u­la­tion – the ur­ban, ed­u­cated mid­dle-class vot­ers who would find th­ese ideas quite ridicu­lous, and the rural pop­u­la­tion who re­lied and trusted mainly in Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s per­son­al­ity.”</p>
    <p>The USDP’s poor show­ing will likely put the mil­i­tary on the de­fen­sive go­ing for­ward.</p>
    <p>“Chances are they will cling more to their ex­ist­ing pre­rog­a­tives in the Con­sti­tu­tion,” said Mr Soe Myint Aung. “It is un­likely they will au­to­mat­i­cally start think­ing about grad­ual with­drawal from the leg­is­la­ture, or the ad­min­is­tra­tion.”</p>
    <p>It was un­able to make it­self more ap­peal­ing to the public. It was play­ing mostly with the idea of ethno-re­li­gious na­tion­al­ism, and the need to pro­tect Myan­mar from for­eign in­ter­fer­ence.</p>
