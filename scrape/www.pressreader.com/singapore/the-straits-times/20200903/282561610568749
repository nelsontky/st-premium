    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Over the years, ac­tress Mar­ilee Talk­ing­ton, who is legally blind, has re­peat­edly au­di­tioned for tele­vi­sion shows fea­tur­ing a char­ac­ter who is also blind.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral times, how­ever, the same thing hap­pened: The part went to an ac­tress who was not blind.</p>
    <p>“It’s a punch to the gut,” Talk­ing­ton said. “If you’re white and play­ing a per­son of colour, do you know how of­fen­sive that is? We need to look at dis­abil­ity the same way.”</p>
    <p>As Hol­ly­wood faces an­other reck­on­ing over its lack of di­ver­sity, ac­tors with dis­abil­i­ties are hop­ing they will be in­cluded in the con­ver­sa­tion this time.</p>
    <p>Stu­dios are un­der pres­sure to ad­dress racial and gen­der in­equal­ity. But the in­dus­try’s fail­ure to cre­ate more dis­abled char­ac­ters – and to cast ac­tors with dis­abil­i­ties in those roles – has re­ceived much less at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties rep­re­sent about 20 per cent of the United States’ pop­u­la­tion. Yet just 3 per cent of reg­u­lar char­ac­ters on TV shows have a dis­abil­ity.</p>
    <p>Of the dis­abled char­ac­ters on TV and stream­ing ser­vices, more than three-quar­ters were played by ac­tors who do not have the same dis­abil­ity, ac­cord­ing to the Ru­d­er­man Fam­ily Foun­da­tion, which works to pro­mote more in­clu­sive poli­cies for peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Ad­vo­cates say such cast­ing de­ci­sions are in­sult­ing and take op­por­tu­ni­ties from per­form­ers with dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“Try­ing to find an au­then­ti­cally played dis­abled char­ac­ter on screen is like try­ing to find Waldo,” said co­me­dian Maysoon Zayid, who has cere­bral palsy and plays a re­cur­ring role on soap opera Gen­eral Hospi­tal (1963 to present).</p>
    <p>“I don’t think Hol­ly­wood can truly be con­sid­ered in­clu­sive un­til they stop the hor­rid practice of cast­ing non-dis­abled ac­tors to play vis­i­bly dis­abled roles.”</p>
    <p>There are signs the in­dus­try is start­ing to change. Co­me­dian Steve Way, who has mus­cu­lar dys­tro­phy, has a part on Ramy (2019 to present), a com­edy on Hulu about a young Amer­i­can Mus­lim strug­gling with his faith.</p>
    <p>Talk­ing­ton has a re­cur­ring role on the first sea­son of See (2019 to present), a science-fiction show on Ap­ple TV+ in which the hu­man race has lost its sense of sight.</p>
    <p>Yet all too of­ten, ad­vo­cates say, the roles of dis­abled char­ac­ters are given to able-bod­ied ac­tors such as Bryan Cranston, who played a quad­ri­plegic in the movie The Up­side (2017), or Dwayne “The Rock” John­son, who played an am­putee in Sky­scraper (2018).</p>
    <p>Over the years, Hol­ly­wood has fre­quently given able-bod­ied ac­tors Os­cars for por­tray­ing dis­abled char­ac­ters, from Dustin Hoff­man in Rain Man (1988) to Ed­die Red­mayne in The Theory Of Ev­ery­thing (2014).</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery sin­gle time a non-dis­abled ac­tor is cast in a dis­abled role is a step back­wards,” said ac­tor Ryan Had­dad, who has cere­bral palsy and plays a stu­dent on Net­flix’s The Politi­cian (2019 to present).</p>
    <p>“Be­fore you even get to the au­di­tion process, you need to say, ‘if I’m writ­ing this char­ac­ter, it will be played by a dis­abled ac­tor and that’s it. There’s no other op­tion.’”</p>
    <p>Some ac­tors with dis­abil­i­ties are hope­ful the Black Lives Mat­ter move­ment will lead to greater in­clu­sion of all marginalis­ed groups in Hol­ly­wood. Oth­ers re­main scep­ti­cal, hav­ing seen peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties overlooked dur­ing sim­i­lar ini­tia­tives be­fore.</p>
    <p>“A cou­ple years ago, when the Os­cars put out that state­ment on di­ver­sity, dis­abled peo­ple were com­pletely left out,” Way said.</p>
    <p>“It wouldn’t sur­prise me if it hap­pens again.”</p>
    <p>In January, the Ru­d­er­man Fam­ily Foun­da­tion wrote an open let­ter call­ing for more cast­ing of peo­ple with dis­abil­i­ties, signed by ma­jor stars such as George Clooney and Olivia Munn.</p>
    <p>The group’s pres­i­dent, Mr Jay Ru­d­er­man, has asked all the ma­jor US media com­pa­nies to pledge to au­di­tion and cast more per­form­ers with dis­abil­i­ties. So far, only CBS has agreed.</p>
    <p>Mr Ru­d­er­man said: “The fact that I can name only one cor­po­rate leader who has come for­ward and said ‘this is the right thing to do’ is pretty sad.”</p>
    <p>Ad­vo­cates say there need to be more well-rounded roles for ac­tors that have lit­tle or noth­ing to do with their dis­abil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>“We need more sto­ries that don’t just i nvolve a dis­abled per­son want­ing to kill them­selves or lose their vir­gin­ity,” Way said.</p>
    <p>Such por­tray­als can be done right. Dur­ing the first sea­son of The Politi­cian, Had­dad’s char­ac­ter refers to his dis­abil­ity only once.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t the only rea­son I was there,” he said. “It was re­fresh­ing to just have my walker and be in the story, and not have my arc be ob­ses­sively about cere­bral palsy.”</p>

        <p data-role="text">Ad&#xAD;vo&#xAD;cates for di&#xAD;ver&#xAD;sity in film and tele&#xAD;vi&#xAD;sion say the roles of dis&#xAD;abled char&#xAD;ac&#xAD;ters are too of&#xAD;ten given to able-bod&#xAD;ied ac&#xAD;tors such as Dwayne John&#xAD;son (left, with ac&#xAD;tress McKenna Roberts), who played an am&#xAD;putee in the 2018 film Sky&#xAD;scraper.</p>
