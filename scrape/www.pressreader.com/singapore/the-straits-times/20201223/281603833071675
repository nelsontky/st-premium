    <p>Many shops shut­tered this year af­ter bear­ing the brunt of the Covid-19 cri­sis, but su­per­mar­kets con­tin­ued to reel cus­tomers in. Sheng Siong Group, in par­tic­u­lar, saw its earn­ings soar. Its profit for the first nine months of this year surged 82.6 per cent to</p>
    <p>$107 mil­lion and rev­enue was up 44.6 per cent to $1.07 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Many shops shut­tered this year af­ter bear­ing t he brunt of the Covid-19 cri­sis, but one cat­e­gory of re­tail stood its ground with no short­age of cus­tomers, and be­came even more pop­u­lar.</p>
    <p>Su­per­mar­kets and hy­per­mar­kets con­tin­ued to reel them in, with tak­ings at the till ris­ing by 22.3 per cent over the same time last year in Oc­to­ber, ac­cord­ing to the Depart­ment of Sta­tis­tics.</p>
    <p>One lo­cal chain, in par­tic­u­lar, saw its earn­ings soar.</p>
    <p>Sheng Siong Group’s third- quar­ter net profit surged 54.4 per cent to $31.8 mil­lion be­cause of higher de­mand for gro­ceries.</p>
    <p>Its profit f or the first nine months surged 82.6 per cent to $107 mil­lion, and rev­enue was up 44.6 per cent to $1.07 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>Aside from the early panic buy­ing, when peo­ple rushed to stock up in case of short­ages, cook­ing and eat­ing at home be­came the norm for most Sin­ga­pore­ans dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Sheng Siong also found a niche among heart­land res­i­dents and cost-con­scious con­sumers, es­pe­cially in the un­cer­tain eco­nomic cli­mate.</p>
    <p>Its push into e-com­merce, with an on­line shop­ping plat­form launched in 2014 for home de­liv­er­ies, also helped boost sales.</p>
    <p>The firm de­clined to com­ment on its per­for­mance this year when con­tacted by The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>Brothers Lim Hock Eng, Lim Hock Chee and Lim Hock Leng founded the su­per­mar­ket chain in 1985.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim Hock Chee, 59, who is Sheng Siong’s chief ex­ec­u­tive, and his wife, Madam Lee Moi Hong, also 59, started with a rented stall in a now-de­funct su­per­mar­ket in Ang Mo Kio selling chilled pork from his father’s pig farm. When the store owner put the place up for sale, Mr Lim and his brothers de­cided to take over the space, nam­ing it Sheng Siong.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s third-largest su­per­mar­ket chain, which listed on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change’s main­board in 2011, now has more than 60 stores across the is­land and a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of $2.35 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>DBS an­a­lysts Al­fie Yeo and Andy Sim ex­pect Sheng Siong to keep grow­ing next year, even as earn­ings are ex­pected to nor­malise when the econ­omy en­ters phase three of re­open­ing, as it grew its num­ber of stores this year and oper­a­tions are more ef­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>Sheng Siong opened five stores in the first nine months, in ar­eas such as Sengkang and Tampines.</p>
    <p>The DBS an­a­lysts wrote in a note in Oc­to­ber: “We see mar­gins con­tin­u­ing to strengthen through bet­ter sales mix of fresh food, higher sup­plier re­bates, more house brands and more di­rect sourc­ing ini­tia­tives.”</p>
