    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Check your in­box – you need to make sure you did not for­get some­one. This is a good day to catch up on all of your cor­re­spon­dence.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20) If you push your­self too hard, you may find that you are just spin­ning your wheels. Wait un­til to­mor­row to rev back into gear.</p>
    <p>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>To­day is all about con­ver­sa­tion. En­sure that you are work­ing with the right peo­ple. Things get more in­ter­est­ing as the day pro­gresses.</p>
    <p>Cancer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>You feel over­whelmed and there are far too many things go­ing on around you. Fo­cus on the stuff that makes sense and wait on the rest.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>Your great en­ergy helps you meet new peo­ple and make a great im­pres­sion. It is a great time to crash a party or to host one.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>Be at your best. Your en­ergy is best spent on things that are im­por­tant, so make sure you are fo­cused on your high­est pri­or­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>You are in the thick of things. Your ter­rific men­tal and so­cial en­er­gies are in sync, so you should be able to tackle all this ac­tiv­ity with ease.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>Do not gam­ble any­thing you can­not af­ford to lose. This may be one of those times when you are bet­ter off quit­ting.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>You should find your­self en­gaged in work or fam­ily life and you may hit on a new bal­ance that keeps you and your peo­ple happy and healthy.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>You need to cut to the chase and do not hem and haw. Some peo­ple are likely caus­ing dis­rup­tions, so try not to con­trib­ute to that.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Your ro­man­tic life gets a boost.</p>
    <p>You may meet some­one new or fall in love deeper with your sweet­heart. It feels great, so em­brace it.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>You can­not get a han­dle on your emo­tions. Get a loose sense by telling a story that res­onates with you in some way.</p>
