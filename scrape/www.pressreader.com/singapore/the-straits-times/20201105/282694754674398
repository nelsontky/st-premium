    <p>In the midst of film­ing her new Chan­nel 8 drama se­ries A Jun­gle Sur­vivor, lo­cal ac­tress Re­becca Lim was so tired one day that she fell asleep in her car, when she only in­tended to “rest her eyes”.</p>
    <p>In a phone call with The Straits Times, the 34-year-old ac­tress says: “This is my tough­est drama yet. It’s the first I shot after the cir­cuit breaker mea­sures, so there were new safety reg­u­la­tions and film­ing was ex­tended from the usual two months to three months. I had 500 scenes and only three days off dur­ing the en­tire process – polling day and my par­ents’ birth­days.”</p>
    <p>Her role did not make it any eas­ier ei­ther: she plays a jilted wife who joins her hus­band’s (Pierre Png) com­pany after over a decade away from the work­force and finds out that he is hav­ing an af­fair with a col­league (Feli­cia Chin).</p>
    <p>“She has a lot of ups and downs in her emo­tional jour­ney,” Lim ex­plains.</p>
    <p>In a trailer for the se­ries, she says to once ru­moured beau Ian Fang who has a cameo in the se­ries: “You’re just find­ing ex­cuses for your cheat­ing.”</p>
    <p>They were linked for sev­eral years, though their re­la­tion­ship was never con­firmed. Last year, texts of a sex­ual na­ture be­tween Fang and another Me­di­a­corp ac­tress Car­rie Wong were leaked.</p>
    <p>Lim says of work­ing with Fang, who sang the se­ries’ theme song: “It’s been awhile since we acted to­gether. I feel that he has ma­tured and it’s a pity we don’t have more scenes to­gether.</p>
    <p>“There’s no awk­ward­ness at all since we’re all friends.”</p>
    <p>When asked if she would, like in the drama se­ries, fight to win back her man if she was ever cheated on, she says: “I think 10 years ago I might have. But now I know how to love and trea­sure my­self. It de­pends where the re­la­tion­ship is at too – maybe it’s bet­ter not to be to­gether.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides ro­mance and mar­riage, of­fice pol­i­tics fig­ure promi­nently in the se­ries too, as most of the char­ac­ters are col­leagues in the same of­fice.</p>
    <p>Though Lim – who went into full-time act­ing after grad­u­at­ing from univer­sity – has lit­tle ex­pe­ri­ence with of­fice pol­i­tics, she says: “I think in this in­dus­try, time re­ally shows a per­son’s heart and who’s good to you and who’s not. I think I used to want to please ev­ery­one but I’ve def­i­nitely ma­tured.”</p>
    <p>Lim is one half of lo­cal en­ter­tain­ment’s most fa­mous for­mer friend­ships. She met ac­tor Des­mond Tan at an in­ter-ju­nior-col­lege beauty pageant as stu­dents and have been close from then un­til 2015.</p>
    <p>Tan, 34, was on an episode of talk show Hear U Out re­cently, where he ad­mit­ted a mis­un­der­stand­ing caused a rift in their friend­ship.</p>
    <p>When asked about the episode, Lim says some­what cryp­ti­cally: “I don’t think one needs a lot of friends, but one needs true friends. I’ve had plenty of good times in this in­dus­try with my col­leagues and I don’t think there’s any­thing such as for­ever friends or for­ever foes.”</p>
    <p>On-screen, how­ever, Lim does have a foe – Feli­cia Chin, 36, who plays her hus­band’s lover Olivia.</p>
    <p>In a phone in­ter­view, Chin, who is well-known for her girl-nextdoor im­age says act­ing as the “third party” in a mar­riage sig­ni­fies a new phase in her ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“From an act­ing per­spec­tive, it’s re­ally time for me to grow up,” she says.</p>
    <p>The star was fur­ther at­tracted by the nu­anced script­ing of her char­ac­ter in the show.</p>
    <p>She says: “I think the di­rec­tors wanted a se­ries that shows what a bro­ken mar­riage is like from all per­spec­tives. It’s a more re­flec­tive kind of look – it’s not so black and white.</p>
    <p>“Like my char­ac­ter Olivia – she’s ac­tu­ally a re­ally bro­ken woman with a very strong fa­cade. It’s quite rare to have such a script in a lo­cal con­text which ex­plores why a woman would be­come a third party to a mar­riage.”</p>
    <p>Chin, who says she be­lieves strongly in the sanc­tity of mar­riage, is un­sure what she might do if she had a phi­lan­der­ing hus­band.</p>
    <p>She says: “When you’re hurt there’s a process to go through. No one can re­ally say what they will do or not do in that sit­u­a­tion. You may not be very ra­tio­nal when you are hurt and still in love.”</p>
    <p>For­tu­nately, Chin has a ful­fill­ing ro­mance in real life, with ac­tor Jef­frey Xu. The cou­ple have been dat­ing openly since 2016.</p>
    <p>“He’s very sweet, he vis­ited me while I was on set and ev­ery­one seemed happy to see him,” she says.</p>
    <p>As to whether wed­ding bells will ring for her soon, she says with a laugh: “Not yet.”</p>
    <p>A Jun­gle Sur­vivor pre­mieres Nov 11 at 9pm on Chan­nel 8, and will be avail­able on meWatch from Nov 9.</p>
