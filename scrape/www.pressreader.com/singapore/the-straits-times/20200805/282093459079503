    <p>It was an anony­mous let­ter by a whis­tle-blower ac­cus­ing Fuji Xerox Sin­ga­pore man­ag­ing di­rec­tor Bert Wong of “bribery and crim­i­nal breach of trust” that trig­gered a special au­dit in 2017.</p>
    <p>But even though the three-month in­ves­ti­ga­tion by ex­ter­nal au­di­tors found no ev­i­dence of fraud on the part of Mr Wong, who was near­ing re­tire­ment, he was sacked and de­nied a re­tire­ment pay­out of close to $1.3 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, at the start of a High Court hear­ing into his wrong­ful dis­missal suit, his lawyers con­tended that top ex­ec­u­tives at the Ja­pan­head­quar­tered multi­na­tional cor­po­ra­tion had “or­ches­trated Mr Wong’s sum­mary dis­missal at the doorstep of his re­tire­ment”.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong, 64, who started out as a pho­to­copier sales­man in 1980 and rose through the ranks over 38 years, is claim­ing a to­tal of more than $1.5 mil­lion, com­pris­ing his re­tire­ment pay­out and other re­mu­ner­a­tion.</p>
    <p>“This is a case of cor­po­rate be­trayal,” said his lawyers, Mr Wendell Wong and Mr Jared Chen, in their open­ing state­ment.</p>
    <p>The lawyers said there was ev­i­dence that while the au­dit was still on­go­ing, sev­eral ex­ec­u­tives i n Ja­pan were hav­ing e-mail dis­cus­sions on the ac­tions to be taken against Mr Wong.</p>
    <p>The lawyers sug­gested that the com­pany, which was then reel­ing from a mas­sive ac­count­ing scan­dal at its Aus­tralia and New Zealand sub­sidiaries, had cast him aside to show stake­hold­ers that de­ci­sive ac­tion was be­ing taken through­out the en­tire group.</p>
    <p>Fuji Xerox, rep­re­sented by Mr Aaron Lee, de­nied the con­spir­acy claim, call­ing it “noth­ing more than a prod­uct of the plain­tiff’s s own cre­ative imag­i­na­tion and para­noia”.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has coun­ter­claimed against Mr Wong, al­leg­ing that he caused nearly $3 mil­lion in losses by “reck­lessly” caus­ing it to en­ter into nu­mer­ous busi­ness trans­ac­tions that were against its best in­ter­ests.</p>
    <p>In mid-2017, the Fuji Xerox brand took a hit world­wide af­ter a 52-day special au­dit in Aus­tralia and New Zealand re­vealed ac­count­ing ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties that caused losses of about US$350 mil­lion (S$482 mil­lion).</p>
    <p>In Au­gust 2017, the Sin­ga­pore sub­sidiary re­ceived a let­ter con­tain­ing al­le­ga­tions of mis­con­duct in the way Mr Wong man­aged the busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Deloitte & Touche was hired to in­ves­ti­gate the al­le­ga­tions, while an in­ter­nal team also car­ried out its own probe.</p>
    <p>Mr Wong was sacked with­out no­tice in De­cem­ber 2017. He said he was not told of the spe­cific grounds for his dis­missal un­til he started le­gal ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Fuji Xerox con­tended that the au­dit re­vealed nu­mer­ous ir­reg­u­lar­i­ties in past busi­ness trans­ac­tions, in­clud­ing agree­ments in 2014 and 2015 to lease div­ing equip­ment to a com­pany known as Marine Off­shore Ser­vices.</p>
    <p>It said it was en­ti­tled to dis­miss Mr Wong be­cause of the way he han­dled these trans­ac­tions and ex­posed the com­pany to un­nec­es­sary fi­nan­cial li­a­bil­ity.</p>
    <p>The trial, which is sched­uled for eight days, con­tin­ues to­day.</p>
