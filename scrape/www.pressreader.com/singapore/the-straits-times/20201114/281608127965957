    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump’s re­fusal to al­low Pres­i­den­t­elect Joe Bi­den and his tran­si­tion staff ac­cess to gov­ern­ment of­fices, se­cure com­mu­ni­ca­tions and clas­si­fied brief­ings has prompted grow­ing warn­ings, in­clud­ing from Repub­li­cans, that keep­ing Mr Bi­den in the dark po­ten­tially en­dan­gers the coun­try.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den yes­ter­day pulled fur­ther ahead from Mr Trump in the election by win­ning the state of Ari­zona, as called by US net­works. Ari­zona gives Mr Bi­den a 290 to 217 lead over Mr Trump in the Elec­toral Col­lege, with 270 needed to win the White House.</p>
    <p>On Capi­tol Hill, sev­eral Se­nate Repub­li­cans in­sisted that Mr Bi­den should at least be given ac­cess to the Pres­i­dent’s daily brief, the com­pen­dium of the na­tion’s most closely guarded in­tel­li­gence se­crets and as­sess­ments of threats like ter­ror­ist plots and cy­ber at­tack vul­ner­a­bil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Their call amounted to an ac­knowl­edge­ment that Mr Bi­den would be de­clared the vic­tor in the election.</p>
    <p>“I don’t think they need to know ev­ery­thing,” Sen­a­tor Roy Blunt, a mem­ber of the Se­nate Repub­li­can lead­er­ship, said of Mr Bi­den’s ad­vis­ers. “I think they do need to know some things, and na­tional se­cu­rity would be one of them.”</p>
    <p>“Pres­i­dent-elect Bi­den should be re­ceiv­ing in­tel­li­gence brief­ings right now; that is re­ally im­por­tant,” said Sen­a­tor Su­san Collins, a mem­ber of the In­tel­li­gence Com­mit­tee and one of the few Se­nate Repub­li­cans to pub­licly ac­knowl­edge Mr Bi­den’s</p>
    <p>vic­tory. “It’s prob­a­bly the most im­por­tant part of the tran­si­tion.”</p>
    <p>Giving Mr Bi­den and his top aides ac­cess to the daily brief­ing, as Mr Trump got right af­ter his election four years ago, would ad­dress only a frac­tion of the prob­lem. Mr Bi­den will con­front an ar­ray of com­plex dilem­mas: bruised re­la­tion­ships with for­eign al­lies, a weak econ­omy and slug­gish re­cov­ery, per­haps the most high-risk pe­riod yet of the coro­n­avirus, and a need to dis­trib­ute a vac­cine to 330 mil­lion Amer­i­cans.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent-elect’s team is con­cerned that it is be­ing shut out of plan­ning for the vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion, a huge un­der­tak­ing that the in­com­ing ad­min­is­tra­tion ex­pects to</p>
    <p>in­herit the mo­ment Mr Bi­den is sworn in. His ad­vis­ers said they have not had ac­cess to the de­tails of Warp Speed, the project that has vac­cine dis­tri­bu­tion plan­ning well un­der way, and un­der­stand lit­tle about its work­ings.</p>
    <p>It is fo­cus­ing on lo­gis­ti­cal chal­lenges and pol­icy ques­tions, one se­nior Bi­den ad­viser said, like how to pri­ori­tise who gets a vac­cine and how to make dis­tri­bu­tion eq­ui­table along racial and so­cioe­co­nomic lines – a pri­or­ity of Mr Bi­den’s, but one rarely dis­cussed by Mr Trump.</p>
    <p>His stonewalli­ng is al­ready cre­at­ing mod­est risks in the Pres­i­den­t­elect’s deal­ings with for­eign lead­ers: Mr Bi­den made his first con­tacts on un­se­cured tele­phone lines, with­out State De­part­ment trans­la­tors or brief­ings about what those lead­ers might seek from him.</p>
    <p>Aides to Mr Bi­den said that so far, the risks were man­age­able.</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s team of more than 500 for­mer of­fi­cials and out­side ex­perts has so far em­braced work­arounds, talk­ing over en­crypted apps like Sig­nal to shield their con­ver­sa­tions from the Chi­nese and meet­ing in out­door cof­fee shops with gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials they once worked along­side.</p>
    <p>The con­ver­sa­tions are cir­cum­spect be­cause of rules on both sides lim­it­ing their ex­changes of in­for­ma­tion, par­tic­i­pants said.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the first small cracks have be­gun to ap­pear in the Repub­li­can wall of sup­port for Pres­i­dent Trump and his un­founded claims of voter fraud. A grow­ing num­ber of elected of­fi­cials and party lead­ers sig­nalled on Thurs­day that they would in­dulge Mr Trump’s con­spir­acy the­o­ries for only so long. A few were will­ing to openly con­tra­dict him.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor Mike DeWine of Ohio said it was time to call Mr Joseph R. Bi­den Jr the “Pres­i­dent-elect”.</p>
    <p>The Repub­li­can At­tor­ney-Gen­eral of Ari­zona said Mr Trump would not end up win­ning his state, de­spite the Pres­i­dent’s protes­ta­tions.</p>
    <p>In­flu­en­tial party fi­nanciers and strate­gists have be­gun to weigh in, as well.</p>
    <p>“The Pres­i­dent does a dis­ser­vice to his more ra­bid sup­port­ers by in­sist­ing that he would have won the Nov 3 election ab­sent voter fraud,” said an ed­i­to­rial in The Las Ve­gas Re­view-Jour­nal, a news­pa­per owned by the fam­ily of the Repub­li­can megadonor Shel­don Adel­son. “That’s sim­ply false.”</p>
    <p>Mr Karl Rove, the Repub­li­can strate­gist, pub­lished a Wall Street Jour­nal op-ed es­say un­der the head­line, “This election re­sult won’t be over­turned”.</p>
