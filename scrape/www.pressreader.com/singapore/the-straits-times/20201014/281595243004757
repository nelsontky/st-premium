    <p>If Demo­cratic candidate Joe Biden wins the US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion, US eco­nomic pol­icy will be less capri­cious and more mul­ti­lat­eral, says as­so­ciate ed­i­tor Vikram Khanna (be­low).</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts have started putting out re­ports on “Bi­de­nomics”, and with good rea­son. Judg­ing from the opin­ion polls, there’s a fair chance – though it’s by no means cer­tain – that Demo­cratic candidate Joe Biden will win the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion on Nov 3.</p>
    <p>So it’s worth spec­u­lat­ing on what Bi­de­nomics will be about and its pos­si­ble im­pact on Asia, which could be far-reach­ing.</p>
    <p>Un­der cen­trist ad­min­is­tra­tions, there is of­ten a de­gree of con­ti­nu­ity in US eco­nomic pol­icy, as there was, for ex­am­ple, from the Ge­orge H.W. Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion to the Clin­ton ad­min­is­tra­tion, and from the lat­ter to the Ge­orge W. Bush ad­min­is­tra­tion, and even to the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>But in the case of the up­com­ing elec­tion, if there is a tran­si­tion, it will not be from one cen­trist ad­min­is­tra­tion to another; it will be a size­able swing from a rad­i­cally uni­lat­er­al­ist, con­ser­va­tive and pro-plu­to­cratic regime to what will prob­a­bly be the most left-of-cen­tre, pro-reg­u­la­tion and fis­cally ex­pan­sion­ary gov­ern­ment since that of Franklin D. Roo­sevelt in the 1930s.</p>
    <p>Just as the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has spent much of the past four years tear­ing up the eco­nomic and so­cial legacy of the cur­rent pres­i­dent’s pre­de­ces­sor, a Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion will sweep away a lot of the Trump-era poli­cies, from taxes and sub­si­dies to reg­u­la­tions, global trade and cli­mate change.</p>
    <p>US Democrats have al­most al­ways been sym­pa­thetic to tax­ing and spend­ing. But with Covid-19, this part of their agenda has be­come su­per­charged in the face of ris­ing job­less­ness, in­equal­ity and cor­po­rate dis­tress, es­pe­cially among small and medium-sized en­ter­prises.</p>
    <p>TAX MORE, SPEND MORE</p>
    <p>A Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion would, if it has its way, hike the top cor­po­rate tax rate from 21 per cent to 28 per cent, par­tially re­vers­ing the re­duc­tion (from 35 per cent to 21 per cent) im­ple­mented by the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion in 2017, and raise the min­i­mum tax on prof­its of for­eign sub­sidiaries of US firms.</p>
    <p>It will fur­ther im­pose a 10 per cent “off­shoring penalty sur­tax” on prof­its made by US com­pa­nies over­seas for sales back to the US.</p>
    <p>On per­sonal taxes, it would re­verse the Trump tax cuts on those earn­ing more than US$400,000 (S$543,400) a year and, for good mea­sure, tax cap­i­tal gains and div­i­dends for those mak­ing more than US$1 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>These tax hikes will pro­vide some of the rev­enue to fund a mas­sive US$7.3 tril­lion planned in­crease in pub­lic spend­ing over the next decade on in­fra­struc­ture, green en­ergy, health­care, re­search and devel­op­ment, ed­u­ca­tion and other so­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>A Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion would also boost in­fra­struc­ture spend­ing (al­though by less than a Biden one), but keep taxes low and cut sev­eral so­cial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>Un­der ei­ther ad­min­is­tra­tion, US pub­lic debt would soar, from just over 100 per cent of gross do­mes­tic prod­uct now to 125 per cent by 2030 un­der the Trump pro­pos­als, and close to 130 per cent un­der the Biden pro­pos­als, ac­cord­ing to the in­de­pen­dent Com­mit­tee for a Re­spon­si­ble Fed­eral Bud­get.</p>
    <p>One im­por­tant caveat: The ul­ti­mate size of the stim­u­lus would de­pend not only on which ad­min­is­tra­tion takes of­fice, but also the com­po­si­tion of Congress, and par­tic­u­larly the Se­nate, which could swing ei­ther way.</p>
    <p>A Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion plus a Se­nate with a Demo­cratic ma­jor­ity would yield the max­i­mum stim­u­lus. But if the Se­nate re­tains its Repub­li­can ma­jor­ity, the stim­u­lus would be wa­tered down.</p>
    <p>Moody’s An­a­lyt­ics, which at­taches a 40 per cent prob­a­bil­ity to this “Biden-lite” out­come, sug­gests that both tax in­creases and spend­ing pro­pos­als would be cut by slightly more than half.</p>
    <p>Even so, fis­cal deficits and pub­lic debt (which is al­ready the high­est since World War II) would soar. Much of the debt would be mon­e­tised by the Fed­eral Re­serve, which has pledged to keep in­ter­est rates at near zero till 2023.</p>
    <p>US eco­nomic growth would get a boost, even un­der the Biden-lite sce­nario, to 5.8 per cent next year, the fastest since 1984, ac­cord­ing to Ox­ford Eco­nom­ics.</p>
    <p>For Asian economies, this would be pos­i­tive on at least two counts.</p>
    <p>The US econ­omy would suck in more im­ports, ben­e­fit­ing Asian ex­porters. Ris­ing US deficits and debts, largely mon­e­tised by the Fed, could also be neg­a­tive (or at best, neu­tral) for the US dol­lar, which would ease dol­lar fund­ing pres­sures fac­ing emerg­ing economies and al­low them to con­tinue keep­ing their own in­ter­est rates low, thereby aid­ing their eco­nomic re­cov­er­ies.</p>
    <p>One neg­a­tive ef­fect, how­ever, will arise from the Biden pro­pos­als to raise taxes on prof­its of for­eign sub­sidiaries of US com­pa­nies and im­pose off­shore tax penal­ties – it would, to some ex­tent, dis­cour­age them from ex­pand­ing over­seas.</p>
    <p>A mas­sive “Buy Amer­i­can” pro­gramme – another pet pol­icy goal of the Biden Democrats that is es­sen­tially an im­port sub­sti­tu­tion strat­egy – would also be a net neg­a­tive for Asian ex­porters.</p>
    <p>DIF­FER­ENTLY TOUGH ON TRADE</p>
    <p>What will be of par­tic­u­lar in­ter­est to Asian coun­tries (but also oth­ers) will be a Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion trade pol­icy. The Demo­cratic Party plat­form in­di­cates it will not re­sort to “self-de­feat­ing, uni­lat­eral tar­iff wars” – which could mean a phased un­wind­ing of the Trump tar­iffs on im­ports from China as well as the Euro­pean Union and oth­ers.</p>
    <p>That said, a Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion will be tougher on trade, es­pe­cially vis-a-vis China, than the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion was; to­day’s Demo­cratic Party is no less hawk­ish on China’s trade poli­cies than the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The party plat­form pledges to “pro­tect the Amer­i­can worker from un­fair trade prac­tices by the Chi­nese gov­ern­ment, in­clud­ing cur­rency ma­nip­u­la­tion and ben­e­fit­ing from a mis­aligned ex­change rate with the dol­lar, il­le­gal sub­si­dies, and theft of in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty”.</p>
    <p>But a Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion will use dif­fer­ent mech­a­nisms to do this. “We will rally friends and al­lies across the world to push back against China or any other coun­try’s at­tempts to un­der­mine in­ter­na­tional norms,” the plat­form points out, which could mean align­ing with the EU and some Asian coun­tries to jointly push for more rec­i­proc­ity in trade with China, rather than act­ing uni­lat­er­ally.</p>
    <p>It might also seek a more col­lec­tive ap­proach to deal­ing with Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies such as Huawei, on which many Democrats share the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s sus­pi­cions of se­cu­rity risks.</p>
    <p>Some schol­ars sug­gest that it might, in fact, be even less tol­er­ant of coun­tries – in­clud­ing those in Asean – adopt­ing Huawei’s net­work­ing tech­nolo­gies.</p>
    <p>How­ever, it would be dis­crim­i­nat­ing in pick­ing its fights with China, col­lab­o­rat­ing with Bei­jing on is­sues such as pub­lic health and the en­vi­ron­ment. It will most likely re­join the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion and the Paris Agree­ment on cli­mate change, from which the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion ex­ited.</p>
    <p>MORE MUL­TI­LAT­ERAL</p>
    <p>Be­ing more sym­pa­thetic to mul­ti­lat­eral in­sti­tu­tions, a Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion might also res­ur­rect the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) by nom­i­nat­ing judges to its ap­pel­late body (which the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion has re­fused to do, thereby paralysing the in­sti­tu­tion), al­though it is un­likely to rely purely on the WTO to re­solve its trade dis­putes, es­pe­cially with China.</p>
    <p>A rein­vig­o­rated WTO would be wel­comed by all coun­tries, in­clud­ing China, but es­pe­cially by smaller na­tions which would re­gain some lever­age in their trade dis­putes with ma­jor eco­nomic pow­ers.</p>
    <p>Un­der a pres­i­dent Biden, the US might also re­join the Com­pre­hen­sive and Pro­gres­sive Agree­ment for Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (CPTPP), the 11-na­tion trade group­ing that suc­ceeded the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship (TPP), a brain­child of pres­i­dent Barack Obama, from which the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion with­drew the United States in 2017.</p>
    <p>But there would be con­di­tions. Dur­ing a pres­i­den­tial pri­mary de­bate in the mid­dle of last year, Mr Biden pointed out: “I would not join the TPP as it was ini­tially put for­ward. I would in­sist that we rene­go­ti­ate pieces of that with the Pa­cific na­tions... so that we could bring them to­gether to hold China ac­count­able.”</p>
    <p>The con­di­tions would prob­a­bly in­clude tougher en­vi­ron­men­tal and labour stan­dards, which would ap­peal to the Demo­cratic Party’s base.</p>
    <p>While the mem­ber coun­tries of the CPTPP have in­di­cated that the deal is not up for rene­go­ti­a­tion, they have made al­lowances for the US to re­join the re­con­fig­ured group­ing and would prob­a­bly wel­come it back, even at the cost of adding a few clauses to the agree­ment. This would pro­vide a fur­ther boost to US-Asian trade.</p>
    <p>A Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion might also re­sort to a col­lab­o­ra­tive ap­proach to counter China’s Belt and Road ini­tia­tive (BRI), a multi-tril­lion-dol­lar in­fra­struc­ture pro­gramme span­ning sev­eral coun­tries in Asia, Africa and Europe.</p>
    <p>At the Indo-Pa­cific Busi­ness Fo­rum in Thai­land last Novem­ber, the US, Ja­pan and Aus­tralia an­nounced an ini­tia­tive called the Blue Dot Net­work, which seeks to cer­tify in­fra­struc­ture projects world­wide that meet high stan­dards of trans­parency, sus­tain­abil­ity and de­vel­op­men­tal im­pact. The hope is to at­tract in­vest­ments from pri­vate in­vestors such as pen­sion funds and in­sur­ance com­pa­nies that man­age tril­lions of dol­lars and seek long-term re­turns.</p>
    <p>This would open the way for more US, Ja­panese and Aus­tralian in­vest­ments in Asian in­fra­struc­ture in par­tic­u­lar – al­though other coun­tries could join in too – which might give China’s BRI some com­pe­ti­tion and force it to raise its own stan­dards of trans­parency and sus­tain­abil­ity, all of which would ben­e­fit the re­gion.</p>
    <p>Al­though the Blue Dot Net­work was ini­ti­ated dur­ing the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, its col­lab­o­ra­tive ap­proach, as well as its goals, are likely to ap­peal to Biden</p>
    <p>Democrats, who seek in­sti­tu­tional so­lu­tions and part­ner­ships to deal with eco­nomic chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>A Biden ad­min­is­tra­tion will not be an Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion ver­sion 2.0. It will tilt fur­ther to the left, be­ing more fis­cally ex­pan­sion­ary, pro-reg­u­la­tion and more vig­i­lant and pro-ac­tive in the area of trade pol­icy.</p>
    <p>But af­ter four years of the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, Bi­de­nomics will usher in a less capri­cious, more pre­dictable and mul­ti­lat­eral ap­proach to eco­nomic pol­i­cy­mak­ing, which Asian coun­tries would wel­come.</p>
