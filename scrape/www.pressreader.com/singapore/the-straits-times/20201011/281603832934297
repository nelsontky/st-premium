    <p>MED­I­CA­TION-FREE</p>
    <p>•</p>
    <p>WASH­ING­TON US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump said he was “med­i­ca­tion-free” and re­vealed more de­tails of his fight with Covid-19 in a tele­vised in­ter­view aired on Fri­day, as he pre­pared to re­sume in-per­son cam­paign­ing yes­ter­day, one week af­ter he was di­ag­nosed.</p>
    <p>The Pres­i­dent ap­peared on Fox’s Tucker Carl­son Tonight for what the White House de­scribed as an on-air “med­i­cal eval­u­a­tion” con­ducted re­motely by Fox con­trib­u­tor doc­tor Marc Siegel.</p>
    <p>“Right now I’m med­i­ca­tion-free, I’m not tak­ing any med­i­ca­tion as of, you know, prob­a­bly eight hours ago,” Mr Trump told Dr Siegel.</p>
    <p>It was un­clear when the in­ter­view, which Mr Carl­son said was filmed by a White House cam­era crew, was taped.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s doc­tors had pre­vi­ously said they have given him an ag­gres­sive cock­tail of ther­a­peu­tic drugs in­clud­ing the steroid dex­am­etha­sone, usu­ally as­so­ci­ated with se­ri­ous Covid-19 cases.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump also said he had been tested again for the virus.</p>
    <p>“I have been retested and I haven’t even found out num­bers or any­thing yet but I’ve been retested, and I know I’m at ei­ther the bot­tom of the scale or free,” he said.</p>
    <p>He said he did not know when his next test would be, adding that it was “prob­a­bly to­mor­row... they test ev­ery cou­ple of days”.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump said the virus had sapped his en­ergy lev­els, adding he “didn’t feel very vi­tal”.</p>
    <p>He also said he “didn’t have a prob­lem with breath­ing”.</p>
    <p>His doc­tors have said he was put on sup­ple­men­tal oxy­gen at least twice, and the Pres­i­dent later said that lung tests had shown “some con­ges­tion in there”.</p>
    <p>Even as ques­tions re­main about whether he is still con­ta­gious, the Pres­i­dent was yes­ter­day sched­uled to make his first pub­lic ap­pear­ance since re­turn­ing from hos­pi­tal­i­sa­tion for Covid-19, set­ting the stage for his re­turn to the cam­paign trail.</p>
    <p>In an ad­dress from a White House bal­cony be­fore hun­dreds of in­vited guests, Mr Trump would seek to show that he has made a strong re­cov­ery from the coro­n­avirus and is ready to re­sume work and re-en­ter the re-elec­tion race against Demo­cratic nom­i­nee and front run­ner Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>The event kicks off what could be a full week of cam­paign travel for the Pres­i­dent, start­ing to­mor­row with a stop in cen­tral Florida for a rally at the Or­lando San­ford In­ter­na­tional Air­port to make up for one can­celled when Mr Trump fell ill.</p>
    <p>The White House event comes at the ear­li­est mo­ment doc­tors said the Pres­i­dent would be able to re­turn to pub­lic life.</p>
    <p>The gath­er­ing risks deep­en­ing con­cern among vot­ers about Mr Trump’s han­dling of a pan­demic that has left more than two dozen of his close as­so­ciates in­fected and more than 210,000 Amer­i­cans dead.</p>
    <p>Af­ter the Pres­i­dent’s last out­door event – a Sept 26 Rose Gar­den cer­e­mony to an­nounce his pick of Mrs Amy Coney Bar­rett for the Supreme Court – at least 11 at­ten­dees tested pos­i­tive for the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>While the White House had a test­ing regime in place to screen for virus cases, few guests wore masks and at­ten­dees min­gled and sat in close prox­im­ity to one another, both in­doors and out­doors.</p>
    <p>With a vir­tual de­bate this week against Mr Bi­den can­celled be­cause Mr Trump re­fused to par­tic­i­pate, the Pres­i­dent is ea­ger to hold sig­na­ture ral­lies that can of­fer him a chance to re­con­nect with vot­ers and rekin­dle en­thu­si­asm for his can­di­dacy.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, Mr Trump is plan­ning an event in west­ern Penn­syl­va­nia, ac­cord­ing to WPXI-TV in Pitts­burgh. His cam­paign is ne­go­ti­at­ing a town hall on net­work tele­vi­sion on Thurs­day, ac­cord­ing to CNN.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s de­ci­sion to re­sume cam­paign­ing was sharply crit­i­cised by Mr Bi­den.</p>
    <p>“Good luck. I wouldn’t show up un­less you have a mask and can dis­tance,” he told reporters in Par­adise, Ne­vada.</p>
    <p>Right now I’m med­i­ca­tion-free, I’m not tak­ing any med­i­ca­tion as of, you know, prob­a­bly eight hours ago.</p>

    <p>DON’T TAKE CHANCES</p>
    <p>Good luck. I wouldn’t show up un­less you have a mask and can dis­tance.</p>
