    <p>De­cathlon is ex­pand­ing its foot­print in Sin­ga­pore as its fifth ex­pe­ri­ence store, De­cathlon Or­chard, opens its doors to­day.</p>
    <p>The Cen­tre­point out­let is the French re­tail gi­ant’s first store in the Or­chard Road shop­ping belt.</p>
    <p>The sports re­tail spe­cial­ist un­veiled the 3,200 sq m store to the me­dia yes­ter­day, one day ahead of its of­fi­cial open­ing.</p>
    <p>The two-storey out­let, which spans six units, is re­plac­ing Metro as The Cen­tre­point’s an­chor ten­ant. This is the first time that Frasers Prop­erty Re­tail, which owns The Cen­tre­point, has a sports re­tailer as the an­chor ten­ant in one of its malls.</p>
    <p>Mr Nils Swolkien, man­ag­ing direc­tor of De­cathlon Sin­ga­pore, said: “We are ex­cited to bring sports closer to the heart of town and make sports ac­ces­si­ble to even more Sin­ga­pore­ans.”</p>
    <p>Like its other ex­pe­ri­ence stores, De­cathlon Or­chard in­cor­po­rates tech­nol­ogy in its op­er­a­tions. For ex­am­ple, shop­pers can ex­plore tents through a vir­tual re­al­ity head­set and ex­pe­ri­ence how these hold up in dif­fer­ent en­vi­ron­ments and weather con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Mr Foo Chai Hong, Frasers Prop­erty Re­tail’s head of cen­tral leas­ing, said: “De­cathlon’s en­try at The Cen­tre­point fits our vi­sion to cre­ate im­mer­sive re­tail ex­pe­ri­ences for our shop­pers’ evolv­ing pref­er­ences. We be­lieve the shop­ping ex­pe­ri­ence must be­come more in­ter­ac­tive, creative and per­son­alised.”</p>
    <p>De­cathlon first ar­rived on Sin­ga­pore’s shores in 2013 as an on­line store. It launched its first phys­i­cal out­let at Viva Busi­ness Park in Chai Chee three years later. Be­sides the five ex­pe­ri­ence stores, it also has seven click-and-col­lect stores.</p>
    <p>Its range of af­ford­able goods – a pair of run­ning socks, for in­stance, costs as lit­tle as $2.50 – has helped it ride out the down­turn caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>While over­all re­tail num­bers in Sin­ga­pore were down by close to 9 per cent in July, De­cathlon ex­pe­ri­enced a 38 per cent in­crease in sales. Its on­line sales in July also grew by more than 300 per cent.</p>
    <p>But De­cathlon is not the only sports re­tailer to see an uptick since the coronaviru­s pandemic.</p>
    <p>Bike shop Bikes n Bites said that sales of its bi­cy­cles per ship­ment, which do not in­clude pre-or­ders, have more than dou­bled since March.</p>
    <p>Its dig­i­tal sales and mar­ket­ing man­ager, Mr Ben­jamin Lee, said: “Sup­ply has not been able to keep up with the de­mand.”</p>
    <p>Al­though sales of sport­ing goods have sky­rock­eted over the past few months, Mr James Wal­ton, sports busi­ness group leader for Deloitte South-east Asia, be­lieves that this might not lead di­rectly to a sig­nif­i­cant con­tri­bu­tion to the lo­cal sports in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Smaller busi­nesses that do not have as great an on­line pres­ence as sport­ing goods gi­ants such as Nike, adi­das, Un­der Ar­mour and De­cathlon may be at the los­ing end.</p>
    <p>“A lot of the shops in Queensway that don’t have an on­line chan­nel miss out,” Mr Wal­ton noted.</p>
    <p>Since malls re­opened un­der phase two of Sin­ga­pore’s Covid-19 mea­sures, Mr Sabeer Mo­hamad, owner of Sah Sports Cen­tre, a sports shop in Queensway Shop­ping Cen­tre, has no­ticed about a 30 per cent drop in the num­ber of cus­tomers. He said: “Some peo­ple are scared to come out. Some say they don’t have enough cash to spend on these things.”</p>
