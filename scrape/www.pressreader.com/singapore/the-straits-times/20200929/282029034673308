    <p>So­cial ser­vice agen­cies can now tap a sec­ond round of fund­ing to trans­form their ser­vice de­liv­ery and op­er­a­tions to cope bet­ter with fu­ture de­mands, such as by ac­quir­ing dig­i­tal tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>The sec­ond tranche of The In­vic­tus Fund, launched in April, is open for ap­pli­ca­tions from now un­til Oct 30.</p>
    <p>The fund is meant to help so­cial ser­vice agen­cies con­tinue pro­vid­ing crit­i­cal ser­vices to vul­ner­a­ble groups amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli an­nounced this to about 500 so­cial ser­vice pro­fes­sion­als, com­pa­nies, donors and public sec­tor rep­re­sen­ta­tives over video­con­fer­enc­ing plat­form Zoom yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>He said: “To make the so­cial ser­vice sec­tor more re­silient and able to cope with fu­ture de­mands, we need to en­able our so­cial ser­vice agen­cies (SSAs) to trans­form to SSA 3.0 – driven by com­mit­ted so­cial ser­vice pro­fes­sion­als, who are aug­mented by vol­un­teers, and or­gan­i­sa­tions that are en­abled by tech­nol­ogy.”</p>
    <p>As of Sept 21, $9.2 mil­lion has been raised from mem­bers of the public, and Bud­get 2020 also pro­vided an $18.3 mil­lion top-up.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos noted that the Com­mu­nity Chest has seen a sig­nif­i­cant drop in do­na­tions to its funded pro­grammes that are not di­rectly re­lated to Covid-19.</p>
    <p>“In fact, we project a 20 to 30 per cent drop in do­na­tions in 2020. If this con­tin­ues, it would be­come a longer-term fund­ing is­sue for the sec­tor,” he said.</p>
    <p>He urged com­pa­nies to con­tinue do­nat­ing so that the Com­mu­nity Chest and SSAs can con­tinue to pro­vide their much­needed ser­vices.</p>
    <p>The first round of fund­ing from The In­vic­tus Fund saw close to $6 mil­lion dis­bursed to 89 SSAs in June, said the Na­tional Coun­cil of So­cial Ser­vice (NCSS), which man­ages the fund.</p>
    <p>About 82 per cent of the funds went to­wards sup­port­ing agen­cies to keep their ser­vices ac­ces­si­ble to ser­vice users, while the re­main­ing 18 per cent went to­wards build­ing SSAs’ dig­i­tal ca­pa­bil­ity and in­fras­truc­ture for bet­ter con­nec­tiv­ity and IT se­cu­rity, said the agency.</p>
    <p>This in­cludes equip­ping prac­ti­tion­ers with ap­pro­pri­ate soft­ware and hard­ware to en­sure ser­vice con­ti­nu­ity and ac­ces­si­bil­ity to their clients as they work from home dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod.</p>
    <p>Vul­ner­a­ble se­niors and clients also re­ceived pre­paid cards to en­sure con­nec­tiv­ity to crit­i­cal ser­vices, and front-line prac­ti­tion­ers and clients were given care pack­ages to im­prove their well­be­ing.</p>
    <p>One SSA t hat ben­e­fited is Lutheran Com­mu­nity Care Ser­vices, which dig­i­talised its work pro­cesses with the fund­ing.</p>
    <p>Its clients can now sub­mit child adop­tion ap­pli­ca­tions dig­i­tally, in­stead of hav­ing to go in per­son, and they can also ac­cess sup­port via vir­tual i nter­views through video­con­fer­enc­ing tools.</p>
    <p>NCSS has also set up one-stop tech­nol­ogy hub Tech-and-GO! (www.go.gov.sg/tng) to help the SSAs with their trans­for­ma­tion.</p>
    <p>It aims to cut down the amount of time needed by the SSAs to search for suit­able dig­i­tal so­lu­tions, and will also of­fer con­sul­tancy ser­vices and cu­rated train­ing cour­ses.</p>
