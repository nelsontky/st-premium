    <p>When Mr Des­mond Toh, 42, was laid off from his restau­rant job at Re­sorts World Sen­tosa (RWS) in last week’s mass re­trench­ment ex­er­cise, he had rea­son to be wor­ried.</p>
    <p>As the sole bread­win­ner in a fam­ily of seven, with age­ing par­ents and three school-go­ing chil­dren, Mr Toh was cal­cu­lat­ing how long his sav­ings would last.</p>
    <p>But he need not have wor­ried, as he landed a job in the food and bev­er­age (F&B) sec­tor on Mon­day. He had been of­fered sev­eral job op­tions by e2i, the Na­tional Trades Union Congress’ (NTUC) Em­ploy­ment and Em­ploy­a­bil­ity In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>Though he will take a pay cut of around a third of his pre­vi­ous salary, he is thank­ful to have a job that will help him pay his father’s med­i­cal bills, among other ex­penses.</p>
    <p>“I was so happy to re­ceive news of get­ting a new job so soon af­ter I was re­trenched that I broke down over the phone,” said Mr Toh, who will be a server and pack food for de­liv­er­ies at a Chi­nese restau­rant.</p>
    <p>A week af­ter RWS laid off about 2,000 em­ploy­ees on July 15, some have al­ready landed on their feet.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times spoke to 13 Sin­ga­porean work­ers, but only two have al­ready found em­ploy­ment.</p>
    <p>One worker in his late 50s who wanted to be known as Azmi said he found a job as a cleaner af­ter ap­ply­ing for six or seven job open­ings.</p>
    <p>“I thought that it would be hard to find a job dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic, es­pe­cially since I am an older worker and do not have the qual­i­fi­ca­tions to do many other jobs,” he said.</p>
    <p>Mr Toh and Mr Azmi are lucky; most of the laid-off work­ers are still wait­ing for job of­fers. The 11 oth­ers ST spoke to said it was hard to find long-term jobs that did not re­quire them to take huge pay cuts.</p>
    <p>Some were of­fered short-term con­tracts, while some white-col­lar work­ers were asked to con­sider in­tern­ships, tem­po­rary place­ments or other lower-paid po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>“Beg­gars can’t be choosers, but I do have bills to pay and a fam­ily to sup­port,” said a for­mer RWS ad­min­is­tra­tive staff mem­ber in her 40s who wanted to be known as Doreen.</p>
    <p>The di­vorced mother of two has been of­fered a short-term con­tract to do data en­try that pays about $1,000 a month. She is hop­ing for a bet­ter op­tion, as “$1,000 is not nearly enough to cover (my) fam­ily’s monthly ex­penses”.</p>
    <p>“I never thought I would be forced to make a mid-ca­reer switch at this age or be scram­bling to find con­tract work,” she said.</p>
    <p>Still, there is help avail­able for work­ers who need more guid­ance and as­sis­tance to find new jobs.</p>
    <p>A job fair held by e2i on Mon­day saw 17 work­ers of­fered jobs on the spot by pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tor em­ploy­ers in the health­care, trans­port and lo­gis­tics, stu­dent care, se­cu­rity, F&B, and in­for­ma­tion and com­mu­ni­ca­tions tech­nol­ogy in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>All the lo­cal non-PMET (pro­fes­sional, man­ager, ex­ec­u­tive and tech­ni­cian) and ju­nior PMET work­ers who were laid off from RWS were in­vited to the fair, and of about 300 of them who showed up, 75 per cent were short­listed by em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>Mr Gil­bert Tan, e2i chief ex­ec­u­tive, said all the lo­cal re­trenched work­ers have been pre-matched to job op­por­tu­ni­ties but the ac­tual time taken be­fore suc­cess­ful place­ment could dif­fer. “This would be de­pen­dent on each in­di­vid­ual job seeker’s ex­pec­ta­tions, in­ter­ests, avail­able roles in their in­dus­try of in­ter­est and the cur­rent skill sets that they have which may be rel­e­vant or trans­fer­able in their new role.”</p>
