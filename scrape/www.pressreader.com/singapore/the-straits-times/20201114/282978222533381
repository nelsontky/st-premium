    <p>BMW iX to ar­rive in 2022</p>
    <p>BMW says its iN­ext con­cept will be called iX (above). About the size of the BMW X5, the largest elec­tric BMW an­nounced so far will be out late next year, which means it should ar­rive here by the sec­ond half of 2022. It has a max­i­mum out­put of more than 500hp, a range of 600km and a cen­tury sprint of 5 sec­onds.</p>
    <p>BMW says it will con­sume less than 21kWh/100km. With a high­pow­ered fast charger, the car’s bat­tery can be topped up for 100km in 10 min­utes.</p>
    <p>Volvo’s elec­tric heavy-duty trucks to hit roads next year</p>
    <p>Next year, hauliers in Europe will be able to or­der all-elec­tric ver­sions of Volvo’s heavy-duty trucks. The Swedish com­mer­cial ve­hi­cle group will of­fer a com­plete heavy­duty range with elec­tric driv­e­lines from next year, start­ing in Europe. The trucks will have a gross weight of up to 44 tonnes. De­pend­ing on the bat­tery con­fig­u­ra­tion, the range could be up to 300km.</p>
    <p>Jaguar, Land Rover first to in­te­grate ad­vanced noise-can­celling soft­ware</p>
    <p>Si­len­tium’s Ac­tive Acous­tics soft­ware re­moves 90 per cent of un­wanted noise across a broad band of fre­quen­cies.</p>
    <p>Jaguar and Land Rover are the first to in­te­grate this ad­vanced soft­ware into their ve­hi­cles. The Is­rael-based tech com­pany’s soft­ware al­lows car­mak­ers to re­duce their re­liance on costly and heavy pas­sive noise damp­ing and in­su­la­tion ma­te­ri­als.</p>
    <p>Longer Rolls-Royce Ghost</p>
    <p>The Rolls-Royce Ghost Ex­tended (above), with 170mm of ex­tra room in the cabin, has ar­rived. Re­tail­ing from $1,398,888, the long­wheel­base li­mou­sine has all­wheel-drive and four-wheel steer­ing for those who in­sist on be­ing at the wheel.</p>
    <p>BMW M2 CS sold out</p>
    <p>The BMW M2 CS (above) has landed. The car­bon fibre-re­in­forced plas­tic pocket rocket is pow­ered by a twin-turbo 3-litre in­li­ne­six mak­ing 450hp and 550Nm. It flies to 100kmh in 4.2 sec­onds and on to a top speed of 280kmh.</p>
    <p>BMW says only one unit was im­ported, and it was sold re­cently for around $420,000.</p>
    <p>Bent­ley to go fully elec­tric by 2030</p>
    <p>Bent­ley aims to be end-to-end car­bon neu­tral by 2030 and will of­fer only full-elec­tric or plug-in hy­brid mod­els by 2026, and only full-elec­tric cars by 2030.</p>
    <p>It says it will re­duce fac­tory en­vi­ron­men­tal im­pact by 75 per cent by 2025. One pos­si­ble new model is the EXP 100GT (above), an elec­tric car with a range of 700km.</p>
    <p>Re­freshed Hyundai Kona Elec­tric</p>
    <p>The 2021 Hyundai Kona Elec­tric (above) has un­der­gone ex­te­rior styling changes, with new safety, con­nec­tiv­ity and con­ve­nience fea­tures on­board.</p>
    <p>With a range of up to 480km, the com­pact cross­over has found 120,000 buy­ers since it was launched in 2018. In Au­gust, three pro­duc­tion mod­els set a new range record of 1,026km on a sin­gle bat­tery charge at the Lausitzrin­g in Ger­many. In March, Hyundai started pro­duc­tion of the Kona Elec­tric at its Czech plant.</p>
    <p>Du­cati Mul­tistrada V4 built for en­durance</p>
    <p>The Du­cati Mul­tistrada V4 (right) will ar­rive here in Jan­uary. The fourth-gen­er­a­tion model is more ro­bust and at the same time lighter. It also prom­ises more ver­sa­til­ity and com­fort.</p>
    <p>With 170hp, elec­tronic Mo­toGP aids and an ag­ile chas­sis, the 1,158ccc bike with a 22-litre fuel tank is made for en­durance. Oil change is sched­uled ev­ery 15,000km, while valve clear­ance check and even­tual ad­just­ment is re­quired ev­ery 60,000km – the long­est among pro­duc­tion bikes.</p>
    <p>Jeep Gla­di­a­tor with cus­tom­made flatbed stor­age sys­tem</p>
    <p>The Mopar S cus­tomi­sa­tion team has cre­ated a Jeep Gla­di­a­tor-based con­cept car for se­ri­ous moun­tain bik­ers. The Jeep Gla­di­a­tor Top Dog (right) ex­pands the cargo-car­ry­ing abil­i­ties of the Gla­di­a­tor truck by re­mov­ing the stan­dard cargo box and re­plac­ing it with a cus­tom­made flatbed stor­age sys­tem.</p>
    <p>On the pas­sen­ger side of the stor­age sys­tem, pull-out draw­ers se­curely store tools and sup­plies that moun­tain bik­ers need when out on the trails.</p>
    <p>Vast in­te­rior stor­age shelves, ex­te­rior light­ing switches and ex­tra power sup­plies are within easy reach.</p>
    <p>Aznom Pal­la­dium lux­ury ride based on Ram truck</p>
    <p>Ital­ian coach maker Aznom has un­veiled a “hy­per­limou­sine” called Pal­la­dium (above). Based on a Ram truck, the car which looks faintly like a Rolls-Royce Cul­li­nan (af­ter four beers) is al­most 6m long and 2m tall.</p>
    <p>Ca­pa­ble of travers­ing any ter­rain with two or four­wheel-drive, the car is equipped with a 5.7-litre biturbo en­gine mak­ing more than 700hp and 950Nm. In­side, ex­pect a “high-end de­sign tai­lor-made” cabin with re­clin­ing “busi­ness class” seats.</p>
    <p>Re­nault Trafic Pas­sen­ger for big fam­i­lies</p>
    <p>The Re­nault Trafic Pas­sen­ger comes with LED head­lights, a re­designed dash­board with more pre­mium ma­te­ri­als, and a range of diesel en­gines, in­clud­ing a pow­er­ful new dCi 150. Its in­fo­tain­ment sys­tem has An­droid Auto and Ap­ple CarPlay con­nec­tiv­ity.</p>
    <p>Aimed at large fam­i­lies, the van-based mul­ti­pur­pose ve­hi­cle car­ries up to nine peo­ple, with in­creased lug­gage ca­pac­ity. The Trafic SpaceClass eight-seat vari­ant of­fers more com­fort.</p>
    <p>Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S 4Matic+ sets new lap record</p>
    <p>The Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S 4Matic+ (above) has emerged as the fastest lux­ury car on the Nord­schleife of the Nur­bur­gring cir­cuit in Ger­many.</p>
    <p>The car clocked 7:23 min­utes for the 20.6km ver­sion (with­out straight-line mea­sure­ment for track sec­tion T13) and 7:27 min­utes for the 20.832km com­plete track.</p>
    <p>The 639hp lux­ury car­rier has fully vari­able all­wheel-drive, ac­tive rear-axle steer­ing, an elec­tron­i­cally con­trolled rear-axle lim­ited-slip dif­fer­en­tial and AMG Dy­nam­ics agility pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Scorpio Elec­tric raises $8.5m for first elec­tric mo­tor­cy­cle</p>
    <p>Home-grown elec­tric scooter maker Scorpio Elec­tric has raised US$6.3 mil­lion (S$8.5 mil­lion) in fund­ing.</p>
    <p>In 2018, Scorpio re­ceived $2 mil­lion in seed fund­ing from parent com­pany EuroS­ports Global, which holds the Lam­borgh­ini and Alfa Romeo deal­er­ships here.</p>
    <p>Pro­ceeds of the new fund­ing will be used for soft­ware and hard­ware de­vel­op­ment of Scorpio Elec­tric’s first elec­tric mo­tor­cy­cle. This will in­clude nu­mer­ous pro­to­types and pre-pro­duc­tion builds, the com­pany says. Scorpio is build­ing its head­quar­ters and assem­bly plant. The 3,600 sq m fa­cil­ity in Te­ban Gar­dens is ex­pected to pro­duce up to 8,000 elec­tric mo­tor­cy­cles an­nu­ally.</p>
