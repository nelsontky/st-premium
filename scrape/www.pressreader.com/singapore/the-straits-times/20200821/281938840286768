    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) has re­sponded to con­cerns over the work­force com­po­si­tion in banks in a way that touches on wider per­cep­tions about the pres­ence of for­eign work­ers, par­tic­u­larly pro­fes­sion­als, man­agers, ex­ec­u­tives and tech­ni­cians, in the Sin­ga­pore econ­omy. Re­fer­ring to fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions, MAS es­ti­mates that cit­i­zens make up 70 per cent of the sec­tor’s work­force, with per­ma­nent res­i­dents (PRs) ac­count­ing for an­other 14 per cent. Sin­ga­pore­ans take up 43 per cent of se­nior man­age­ment jobs across the sec­tor, re­flect­ing the Repub­lic’s role as an in­ter­na­tional fi­nan­cial hub. How­ever, MAS will in­ten­sify its en­gage­ment with the se­nior man­age­ment of fi­nan­cial in­sti­tu­tions on their work­force pro­files and plans to in­crease the Sin­ga­porean core.</p>
    <p>The peren­nial is­sue of for­eign tal­ent is in the spot­light again amid the coro­n­avirus pan­demic and the eco­nomic down­turn. Re­cently, Te­masek called out Face­book posts tar­get­ing its In­dian em­ploy­ees, fol­low­ing posts that high­lighted the LinkedIn ac­counts of such em­ploy­ees and ques­tion­ing why the in­vest­ment firm was hir­ing for­eign­ers in­stead of lo­cals. DBS Bank and Stan­dard Char­tered Bank, too, have come un­der sim­i­lar crit­i­cism on so­cial me­dia. Quite rightly, Te­masek took is­sue with a “di­vi­sive, racist cam­paign” based on “false claims”. It clar­i­fied that 90 per cent of its 600-strong staff at its head­quar­ters here are Sin­ga­pore­ans or PRs, a ra­tio sim­i­lar to that of its se­nior lead­er­ship. Glob­ally, the na­tion­al­ity mix of its em­ploy­ees is about 60 per cent Sin­ga­porean and 40 per cent other na­tion­als, of whom around 10 per cent are Sin­ga­pore PRs. The top five groups of for­eign­ers hired are from China, the United States, In­dia, Bri­tain and Malaysia. That gives the lie to dis­in­for­ma­tion of an In­dian slant in its work­force com­po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>The hir­ing prac­tices of Sin­ga­pore agen­cies and com­pa­nies need to be seen in the over­all per­spec­tive of the need for an ef­fec­tive mix of lo­cal and for­eign tal­ent. Dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing goes against the fun­da­men­tals of Sin­ga­pore be­ing an open econ­omy and a mer­i­to­cratic so­ci­ety. Just this month, a fresh group of 47 em­ploy­ers were placed on the Fair Con­sid­er­a­tion Frame­work watch list for po­ten­tially dis­crim­i­na­tory hir­ing prac­tices. Sanc­tions will ap­ply, as they should.</p>
    <p>But it is an en­tirely dif­fer­ent mat­ter when for­eign­ers are tar­geted by na­tion­al­ity or eth­nic­ity purely be­cause they work here. The glob­al­i­sa­tion that fu­els Sin­ga­pore’s growth is bor­der­less by def­i­ni­tion. For­eign­ers work­ing here who bring their spe­cialised skills and cul­tural and lin­guis­tic links to ma­jor mar­kets com­ple­ment and ex­pand the eco­nomic realm for Sin­ga­pore. There is also value in Sin­ga­pore­ans work­ing with for­eign col­leagues to col­lec­tively com­pete against the best across the world, in­clud­ing dur­ing a down­turn be­cause to­gether, they all work to lift the coun­try out of it.</p>
