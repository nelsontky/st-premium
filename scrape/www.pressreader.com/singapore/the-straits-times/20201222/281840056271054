    <p>SYD­NEY • With Syd­ney’s beach­side sub­urbs in lock­down due to a grow­ing Covid-19 out­break, res­i­dents of Aus­tralia’s largest city flocked in record num­bers to get tested for coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>Even at Bondi Beach, 45km away from the coro­n­avirus flare-up, driv­ers queued bumper to bumper in long lines around the fa­mous beach­front wait­ing to get into a drive-through test­ing cen­tre.</p>
    <p>New South Wales state of­fi­cials said 15 peo­ple had tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, bring­ing the to­tal num­ber of cases in its north­ern beaches out­break to 83. New cases were down from 36 the pre­vi­ous day.</p>
    <p>Des­per­ate to con­tain the spread, the state has opened dozens of new test­ing sites, some of which are run­ning 24 hours a day. More than 38,000 tests had been con­ducted in the past 24 hours, a new record.</p>
    <p>State Premier Gla­dys Bere­jik­lian said it was too early to say a larger out­break had been averted as north-eastern sub­urbs en­tered the third day of a five-day lock­down, adding that the sit­u­a­tion is volatile.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia also con­firmed it had de­tected cases of the fast-spread­ing new coro­n­avirus strain that has forced Bri­tain to re­verse plans to ease curbs over Christ­mas.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment would pro­vide an up­date by to­mor­row on “what Christ­mas and the next few days look like” in terms of fur­ther con­tain­ment mea­sures beyond those al­ready im­posed on the north-eastern sub­urbs, Ms Bere­jik­lian said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, other states and ter­ri­to­ries have moved quickly to close bor­ders to all of Syd­ney’s five mil­lion res­i­dents, throw­ing Christ­mas travel plans into dis­ar­ray.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Prime Min­is­ter Scott Mor­ri­son said: “2020 is not done with us yet. The events of the past few days... are in­cred­i­bly frus­trat</p>
    <p>ing and dis­ap­point­ing for peo­ple all around the coun­try who had plans in place to get to­gether and move in be­tween states.”</p>
    <p>New South Wales im­posed a lock­down last Fri­day in Syd­ney’s north­ern beaches area, home to more than 250,000 peo­ple, af­ter the clus­ter of cases emerged, cen­tred on</p>
    <p>two din­ing and en­ter­tain­ment venues. More than 80 lo­ca­tions, in­clud­ing cafes, gyms and su­per­mar­kets across Syd­ney, were iden­ti­fied as hav­ing been vis­ited by peo­ple with con­firmed in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralia has recorded just less than 28,200 cases and 908 deaths since the pan­demic be­gan.</p>
