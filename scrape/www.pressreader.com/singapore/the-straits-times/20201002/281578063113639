    <p>The Na­tional Li­brary Board is launch­ing a sub­scrip­tion ser­vice that de­liv­ers to cus­tomers eight cu­rated English chil­dren’s books a month. Up to 200 chil­dren from low-in­come fam­i­lies will get the sub­scrip­tion free as part of a part­ner­ship with The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund.</p>
    <p>The fa­cade of The Fuller­ton Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore is basked in a pink glow nightly this month to raise aware­ness about breast cancer.</p>
    <p>The pink light-up was launched by Min­is­ter in the Prime Min­is­ter’s Of­fice In­dra­nee Ra­jah yes­ter­day to kick off Breast Cancer Aware­ness Month, which falls in Oc­to­ber.</p>
    <p>Along with this, a pink-themed af­ter­noon tea has been cu­rated by the ho­tel and its sis­ter prop­erty, The Fuller­ton Bay Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore, for this month. For each af­ter­noon tea set sold, $5 will be do­nated to the Breast Cancer Foun­da­tion (BCF).</p>
    <p>Breast cancer claims the lives of more women in Sin­ga­pore than any other form of cancer. Six women here are di­ag­nosed with breast cancer daily and one dies from it ev­ery day.</p>
    <p>“(These) statis­tics are quite high and we re­ally would like to see it come down. I can­not over­state the im­por­tance of early de­tec­tion,” Ms In­dra­nee said.</p>
    <p>Only 62 per cent of women, how­ever, re­ported hav­ing ever done a breast self-ex­am­i­na­tion, noted a sur­vey com­mis­sioned by BCF in 2017.</p>
    <p>Dr Shya­mala Thi­la­garat­nam, group di­rec­tor of out­reach at the Health Pro­mo­tion Board, said the sur­vival rate is very high when breast cancer is de­tected in the early stages.</p>
    <p>“With about 30 per cent of breast cancer (cases) still be­ing di­ag­nosed in the third and fourth stages, we en­cour­age all women to make the first move and go for your mam­mo­gram, and do so reg­u­larly,” she urged.</p>
    <p>Madam Tang Kai Fong, 76, a re­tired seam­stress, ex­pe­ri­enced for her­self the ad­van­tage of early de­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>A rou­tine mam­mo­gram 15 years ago showed she had Stage 1 breast cancer, which is now un­der con­trol af­ter she un­der­went a mas­tec­tomy.</p>
    <p>“Early de­tec­tion can re­ally save lives and all women, young and old, need to be vig­i­lant” and go for checks, she said.</p>
