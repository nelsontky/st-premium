    <p>1 HOW TO AVOID A CLIMATE DIS­AS­TER</p>
    <p>By Bill Gates Ex­pected Feb 16</p>
    <p>The Mi­crosoft co-founder has spent a decade re­search­ing climate change and seek­ing the help of ex­perts in fields from physics to po­lit­i­cal science.</p>
    <p>In this non-fic­tion book, he sets out what has been touted as a wide-rang­ing and prac­ti­cal plan for how the world can work to­wards net zero green­house gas emissions in time to avoid to­tal en­vi­ron­men­tal dis­as­ter.</p>
    <p>2 KLARA AND THE SUN</p>
    <p>By Kazuo Ishig­uro Ex­pected March 2</p>
    <p>It has been five years since the Bri­tish writer’s last novel, The Buried Gi­ant.</p>
    <p>Klara And The Sun will be Ishig­uro’s first book since he won the No­bel Prize in lit­er­a­ture in 2017.</p>
    <p>The author of award-win­ning nov­els such as The Re­mains Of The Day (1989) and Never Let Me Go (2005), enters the realm of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence with Klara, a so­lar-pow­ered Ar­ti­fi­cial Friend who is an as­tute ob­server of hu­man be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>From her place in a store, she watches hu­mans come and go, hop­ing one of them will some­day choose her as a com­pan­ion.</p>
    <p>3 THE COM­MIT­TED</p>
    <p>By Viet Thanh Nguyen Ex­pected March 4</p>
    <p>The Sym­pa­thizer (2015), a tale of a con­flicted Viet­namese dou­ble agent try­ing to make his way in Amer­ica, won Nguyen the Pulitzer Prize for Fic­tion.</p>
    <p>Read­ers last saw the novel’s un­named nar­ra­tor in a crowd of refugees at sea, headed for an un­cer­tain fu­ture. The Com­mit­ted picks up with him in 1980s Paris, still re­cov­er­ing from his trau­matic tor­ture in Viet­nam, as he joins his close friend Bon in deal­ing drugs.</p>
    <p>4 LURKERS</p>
    <p>By Sandi Tan Ex­pected March 30</p>
    <p>This is the first novel by the Sin­ga­pore-born film-maker since her ghostly 2012 de­but, The Black Isle.</p>
    <p>Tan, who won a Sun­dance di­rect­ing award for her au­to­bi­o­graph­i­cal Net­flix doc­u­men­tary Shirk­ers (2018), sets the darkly comic Lurkers in sub­ur­ban Los An­ge­les.</p>
    <p>The cast of char­ac­ters ranges from two pre­co­cious Kore­anAmer­i­can sis­ters, whose lives are up­ended by a sui­cide, to an age­ing gay hor­ror nov­el­ist.</p>
    <p>In a Face­book post in 2019, Tan promised: “There will be mon­sters, there will be ghosts, there will be blood in the snow (from a hand­bag face-smash).”</p>
    <p>5</p>
    <p>FIRST PER­SON SIN­GU­LAR</p>
    <p>By Haruki Murakami, trans­lated by Philip Gabriel</p>
    <p>Ex­pected April 6</p>
    <p>A new Murakami book al­ways gets the lit­er­ary world in a tizzy. The renowned Ja­panese author’s last ex­cur­sion into fic­tion was the hefty Killing Com­menda­tore (2018).</p>
    <p>This time, he presents eight short sto­ries – all nar­rated, sur­pris­ingly, in the first per­son.</p>
    <p>Ex­pect your usual Murakami flavours: med­i­ta­tions on jazz, dream-like se­quences, child­hood mem­o­ries and so on.</p>
    <p>The author blurs the lines be­tween fic­tion and mem­oir in The Yakult Swal­lows Po­etry Collection, an es­say on how his pas­sions for base­ball and writ­ing in­ter­twined in his youth.</p>
    <p>6 WHERE­ABOUTS By Jhumpa Lahiri Ex­pected May 4</p>
    <p>Amer­i­can author Lahiri moved to Italy in 2011 and de­clared she would start writ­ing in Ital­ian.</p>
    <p>Her first novel in her new lan­guage was Dove Mi Trovo (2019), which she has since trans­lated into English as Where­abouts.</p>
    <p>She won the Pulitzer with her de­but collection of short sto­ries, Interprete­r Of Mal­adies (1999), and was short­listed for the Man Booker Prize for her last novel, The Low­land (2013). In Where­abouts, a woman wan­ders alone through a beau­ti­ful Ital­ian city.</p>
    <p>7 NOISE By Daniel Kah­ne­man, Olivier Si­bony and Cass R. Sun­stein</p>
    <p>Ex­pected May 18</p>
    <p>This non-fic­tion book, which was re­port­edly pre-empted in a sev­en­fig­ure deal, is pow­ered by a tri­fecta of thinkers – i nclud­ing Is­raeli psy­chol­o­gist, econ­o­mist and No­bel lau­re­ate Kah­ne­man, who au­thored the mul­ti­mil­lion-copy best­seller Think­ing, Fast And Slow (2011).</p>
    <p>Here, he joins forces with Har­vard Law pro­fes­sor Sun­stein – also the co-author of a best­seller, Nudge (2008) – and strate­gic think­ing spe­cial­ist Si­bony.</p>
    <p>To­gether, they aim to un­tan­gle the count­less fac­tors that im­pact and cloud ev­ery­day de­ci­sion­mak­ing.</p>
    <p>8</p>
    <p>THE NA­TURE OF MID­DLE-EARTH</p>
    <p>By J. R. R. Tolkien Ex­pected June 24</p>
    <p>Tolkien, the author of sem­i­nal fan­tasy epic The Lord Of The Rings (1954 to 1955), died in 1973, but new ma­te­rial from his vast imag­i­nary world con­tin­ues to sur­face.</p>
    <p>This never-be­fore-seen collection of es­says is pub­lished un­der the aus­pices of the author’s es­tate and edited by Carl Hostet­ter, a Tolkienian lin­guis­tic ex­pert.</p>
    <p>He pre­vi­ously worked with Tolkien’s youngest son Christo­pher, who guarded his fa­ther’s legacy un­til his own death at 95 in Jan­uary last year.</p>
    <p>The es­says will ex­am­ine top­ics such as the na­ture of the Valar, the deities of Tolkien’s world of Arda; the geog­ra­phy of Gon­dor, a king­dom of men; and the oft-de­bated sub­ject of whether dwar­ven women can grow beards.</p>
    <p>9 HAR­LEM SHUF­FLE</p>
    <p>By Col­son White­head Ex­pected Sept 14</p>
    <p>White­head is a two-time Pulitzer Prize-win­ner for his hard-hit­ting nov­els of African-Amer­i­can his­tory, The Un­der­ground Rail­road (2016) and The Nickel Boys (2019). This time, he jumps the tracks to a new, lighter genre: crime fic­tion.</p>
    <p>Set in 1960s Har­lem, New York, the novel fol­lows Ray Car­ney, a seem­ingly up­stand­ing fur­ni­ture sales­man whose ne’er-do-well cousin drags him deep into a dou­ble life as a fence for the crim­i­nal un­der­world.</p>
    <p>10 CHRON­I­CLES FROM THE LAND OF THE HAP­PI­EST PEO­PLE ON EARTH</p>
    <p>By Wole Soyinka Ex­pected Sept 28</p>
    <p>This will be the first novel in 48 years from the Nige­rian lit­er­ary ti­tan since Sea­son Of Anomy, his 1973 sopho­more novel.</p>
    <p>Soyinka, 86, is also a play­wright, poet and po­lit­i­cal ac­tivist who in 1986 be­came the first black African to win the No­bel prize for lit­er­a­ture.</p>
    <p>His new novel, a who­dunit and po­lit­i­cal satire, fea­tures mur­der and may­hem in con­tem­po­rary Nige­ria.</p>
    <p>2020 may have left us all on a cliffhange­r, but if your New Year’s res­o­lu­tion is to be more of a page-turner, here are 10 ti­tles to look for­ward to this year</p>
