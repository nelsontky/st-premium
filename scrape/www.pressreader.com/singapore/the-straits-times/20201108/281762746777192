    <p>The in­ci­dents in France and the Nether­lands un­der­line the grow­ing ten­sions be­tween gov­ern­ments in the re­gion that are tak­ing a hard line on is­sues such as free speech, and their many cit­i­zens of Mus­lim faith who have found ma­te­rial like the car­i­ca­tures pro­duced by Char­lie Hebdo and the lan­guage used to de­fend them deeply of­fen­sive.</p>
    <p>AMSTERDAM • A month after a teacher in France was be­headed for show­ing car­i­ca­tures of Prophet Muham­mad to his class, fears are grow­ing in the Nether­lands that the rip­ple ef­fects of the at­tack are spread­ing in that coun­try.</p>
    <p>On Fri­day, an 18-year-old woman in the Dutch city of Rot­ter­dam was ar­rested on sus­pi­cion of mak­ing on­line threats against a high school teacher who had dis­played in his class­room a cartoon sup­port­ing Char­lie Hebdo, the French satir­i­cal news­pa­per that had orig­i­nally pub­lished the Prophet car­i­ca­tures.</p>
    <p>Lo­cal me­dia had, the day be­fore, re­ported that an­other teacher was threat­ened after he showed a cartoon de­pict­ing Prophet Muham­mad dur­ing a class about free speech at a high school in the city of Den Bosch.</p>
    <p>“Ac­tions in re­la­tion to free­dom of speech in schools in Rot­ter­dam and Den Bosch have led to un­rest and even threats,” two Dutch ed­u­ca­tion min­is­ters wrote in a letter to Par­lia­ment to reg­is­ter their dis­may. “To in­tim­i­date and threaten teach­ers can­not be tol­er­ated in any way,” the min­is­ters, Mr Arie Slob and Ms In­grid van En­gelshoven, wrote.</p>
    <p>At the cen­tre of the in­ci­dent at the Em­maus­col­lege high school in Rot­ter­dam was a pic­ture shared on so­cial me­dia of a cartoon posted on a class­room wall by a teacher sev­eral years ago – but no­ticed by stu­dents last Mon­day and shared on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The cartoon de­picted a de­cap­i­tated per­son wear­ing a shirt la­belled “Char­lie Hebdo” stick­ing out his tongue at a bearded man hold­ing a sword, with the word “im­mor­tal” be­low it, ac­cord­ing to the Dutch news­pa­per NRC.</p>
    <p>Mr Joep Ber­trams, a Dutch po­lit­i­cal car­toon­ist, drew the cartoon in Jan­uary 2015, when Char­lie Hebdo was tar­geted by as­sailants an­gered by its car­i­ca­tures of the Prophet in a ter­ror­ist at­tack in Paris that killed 12 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Pic­tures of the cartoon in the Rot­ter­dam class­room were posted on</p>
    <p>In­sta­gram and Snapchat, and cir­cu­lated among stu­dents, at­tract­ing some an­gry at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>“If this isn’t re­moved quickly then we’re go­ing to deal with this dif­fer­ently,” read a caption un­der one pic­ture that showed the cartoon in the class­room on In­sta­gram.</p>
    <p>It was not clear if this comment in­volved the 18-year-old woman who was ar­rested but not named as the au­thor­i­ties did not spec­ify the na­ture of the threat she is ac­cused of mak­ing.</p>
    <p>The post has been deleted, but was pic­tured as a screengrab in the Dutch me­dia.</p>
    <p>The woman was ar­rested on sus­pi­cion of hav­ing posted a mes­sage on so­cial me­dia that “in­cited oth­ers to com­mit crim­i­nal of­fences against the school and teacher”, the po­lice said. The teacher has since gone into hid­ing.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dent came after Dutch schools held memo­ri­als last Mon­day for Mr Sa­muel Paty, the teacher who was killed in France last month.</p>
    <p>The in­ci­dents in France and the Nether­lands un­der­line the grow­ing ten­sions be­tween gov­ern­ments in the re­gion that are tak­ing a hard line on is­sues such as free speech, and their many cit­i­zens of Mus­lim faith who have found ma­te­rial like the car­i­ca­tures pro­duced by Char­lie Hebdo and the lan­guage used to de­fend them deeply of­fen­sive.</p>
    <p>Dutch Prime Min­is­ter Mark Rutte on Fri­day called threats against the teacher from Em­maus­col­lege “ab­surd” and “in­tol­er­a­ble”.</p>
