    <p>The Euro­pean Union and In­dia have pledged to boost trade and in­vest­ment re­la­tions by re­mov­ing Cus­toms hur­dles and ex­pand­ing mar­ket ac­cess as part of a new “broad-based strate­gic part­ner­ship”.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing after a vir­tual sum­mit be­tween the EU and In­dia which took place last Wed­nes­day, Mr Charles Michel, the pres­i­dent of the Euro­pean Coun­cil, the body which brings to­gether the heads of states and gov­ern­ments of the EU states, hailed In­dia as Europe’s “in­dis­pens­able part­ner”.</p>
    <p>And, in what was taken as a di­rect hint at Europe’s cur­rently tense re­la­tions with China, Mr</p>
    <p>Michel also noted that, “as the world’s two largest democ­ra­cies”, Europe and In­dia “share com­mon val­ues – free­dom, rule of law and re­spect for hu­man rights”.</p>
    <p>“We have con­verg­ing in­ter­ests,” the EU leader added, point­edly re­fer­ring to a fu­ture part­ner­ship be­tween the two in “re­gional and global se­cu­rity is­sues”.</p>
    <p>Yet, de­spite these en­cour­ag­ing mes­sages, the re­al­ity re­mains that re­la­tions be­tween the two trad­ing giants re­main cu­ri­ously hes­i­tant.</p>
    <p>The EU is al­ready In­dia’s largest trade and in­vest­ment part­ner, although the re­la­tion­ship is fun­da­men­tally lop­sided.</p>
    <p>Last year, bi­lat­eral trade rose to a to­tal of €80 bil­lion (S$127 bil­lion), with the EU ac­count­ing for no less than 11 per cent of In­dia’s to­tal trade, about the same as the United States’ share of In­dian trade, and way more than the to­tal vol­ume of In­dia’s trade with China.</p>
    <p>How­ever, In­dia rep­re­sents only about 2 per cent of the EU’s to­tal ex­ter­nal trade.</p>
    <p>EU of­fi­cials tout grand vi­sions for fur­ther trade op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>“We agreed to en­hance con­di­tions for traders and in­vestors,” said Mr Michel after talks with In­dia’s Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi.</p>
    <p>“We called for am­bi­tious cli­mate and en­vi­ron­men­tal ac­tion,” he added, “in­clud­ing through in­vest­ments by the Euro­pean In­vest­ment Bank, over €4 bil­lion”.</p>
    <p>Dr Ur­sula von der Leyen, who heads the Euro­pean Com­mis­sion, the EU’s ex­ec­u­tive body, went even fur­ther.</p>
    <p>“In­dia is a nat­u­ral part­ner for the EU in push­ing for­ward our dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion. I have, there­fore, pro­posed to PM Modi to or­gan­ise a high-level EU-In­dia dig­i­tal in­vest­ment fo­rum in which our busi­ness lead­ers can dis­cuss con­crete op­por­tu­ni­ties for co­op­er­a­tion,” she tweeted after the sum­mit.</p>
    <p>But she glossed over the in­con­ve­nient fact that the big tech­no­log­i­cal firms are in the US and not in the EU, so although a big dig­i­tal in­vest­ment get-to­gether may be good for me­dia ap­pear­ances, it is less use­ful for busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Still, the sum­mit made progress with an agree­ment which boosts co­op­er­a­tion on re­search and de­vel­op­ment of nu­clear en­ergy for peace­ful uses be­tween In­dia and Eu­ratom, the EU’s atomic en­ergy agency.</p>
    <p>This is a con­sid­er­able achieve­ment for In­dia, since many Euro­pean coun­tries used to shy away from co­op­er­a­tion in this field, given their re­luc­tance to recog­nise In­dia as a nu­clear mil­i­tary power.</p>
    <p>The sum­mit also saw a great deal of dis­cus­sion on im­prov­ing trade and reg­u­la­tory regimes for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal prod­ucts.</p>
    <p>Europe is de­ter­mined to break away from its de­pen­dence on China in this field – a de­pen­dency made painfully ob­vi­ous dur­ing this Covid-19 pan­demic – so an agree­ment with In­dia which re­moves qual­ity con­trol bar­ri­ers to key phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ingredient­s was in ev­ery­one’s in­ter­est, and rep­re­sented the ful­fil­ment of an­other key, long-stand­ing In­dian de­mand.</p>
    <p>This was ac­com­pa­nied by a series of other com­mit­ments to speed up co­op­er­a­tion on agri­cul­tural and marine trade, re­duce Cus­toms has­sles, pro­tect in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty and ge­o­graph­i­cal in­di­ca­tors and foster co­op­er­a­tion be­tween small busi­nesses and start-ups.</p>
    <p>In­dian of­fi­cials did not hide their dis­ap­point­ment, how­ever, at Europe’s re­luc­tance to take a firmer stand over China’s lat­est mil­i­tary in­cur­sions across its dis­puted bor­der with In­dia.</p>
    <p>Mr Michel read­ily ad­mit­ted that China was a key topic of dis­cus­sion dur­ing the sum­mit: “The Chi­nese ag­gres­sion was dis­cussed with In­dia,” he said after the talks.</p>
    <p>But he re­fused to pro­vide any spe­cific Euro­pean sup­port, be­yond some cliched state­ments such as declar­ing that Europe is “in favour of a peace­ful solution”.</p>
    <p>This EU stance was com­pared un­favourably by In­dian of­fi­cials with the po­si­tion taken by the US, which squarely ap­por­tioned blame to China for the mil­i­tary flare-up at the Sino-In­dian bor­der last month.</p>
    <p>Still, with In­dia due to serve on the UN Se­cu­rity Coun­cil from next year and sched­uled to as­sume the pres­i­dency of the Group of 20 most in­dus­tri­alised states from 2022, there is no ques­tion that the EU will have to of­fer New Delhi much more by the time their next bi­lat­eral sum­mit takes place.</p>
