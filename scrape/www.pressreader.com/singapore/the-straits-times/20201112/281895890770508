    <p>• Bri­tain plans sweep­ing pow­ers to in­ter­vene in for­eign takeovers of Bri­tish as­sets deemed a threat to na­tional se­cu­rity.</p>
    <p>A draft law which was to be pub­lished yes­ter­day would ex­pand the range of trans­ac­tions open to gov­ern­ment in­ter­ven­tion, said the Depart­ment for Busi­ness, En­ergy and In­dus­trial Strat­egy.</p>
    <p>There would be scope for fines and retroac­tive in­ter­ven­tions in deals that are com­pleted af­ter the Bill’s pub­li­ca­tion – a po­ten­tially con­tro­ver­sial pro­vi­sion that crit­ics warn could de­ter in­vestors.</p>
    <p>The leg­is­la­tion does not ex­plic­itly iden­tify any par­tic­u­lar coun­try, but comes against a back­drop of height­ened po­lit­i­cal con­cerns i n Bri­tain over China’s in­volve­ment in crit­i­cally im­por­tant in­fra­struc­ture projects.</p>
    <p>The pro­posed leg­is­la­tion cov­ers sec­tors such as de­fence, en­ergy and trans­port, as the gov­ern­ment seeks to stop Bri­tish com­pa­nies, in­fra­struc­ture and in­tel­lec­tual prop­erty fall­ing into “hos­tile” own­er­ship.</p>
    <p>At the same time, the depart­ment said the new scru­tiny process will be “slicker” than at present, by im­pos­ing set time­frames within which min­is­ters must come to a de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>“The UK re­mains one of the most at­trac­tive in­vest­ment des­ti­na­tions in the world and we want to keep it that way,” Busi­ness Sec­re­tary Alok Sharma said in a state­ment. “But hos­tile ac­tors should be in no doubt – there is no back door into the UK.”</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s Con­ser­va­tive Party have been cam­paign­ing for gov­ern­ment ac­tion against for­eign in­volve­ment in se­cu­rity-sen­si­tive projects, with a par­tic­u­lar fo­cus on the in­flu­ence of China.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier this year, they pressed the Premier to ban Huawei Tech­nolo­gies from Bri­tain’s next-gen­er­a­tion wire­less net­works, re­vers­ing an ear­lier de­ci­sion to al­low the com­pany a role.</p>
    <p>China’s in­volve­ment in Bri­tain’s nu­clear power pro­gramme has also given rise to con­cerns.</p>
    <p>In 2016, then Prime Min­is­ter Theresa May paused the Hink­ley Point C nu­clear project, which is backed by Chi­nese in­vest­ment, be­fore even­tu­ally al­low­ing it to pro­ceed.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Na­tional Se­cu­rity and In­vest­ment Bill, for­eign buy­ers from all coun­tries pur­chas­ing Bri­tish as­sets in 17 sec­tors would be obliged to no­tify the gov­ern­ment of the trans­ac­tion.</p>
    <p>Only some deals in those sec­tors will be cov­ered, and a sep­a­rate con­sul­ta­tion will de­ter­mine the full scope of the law. Min­is­ters would then have 30 days to ei­ther al­low a trans­ac­tion to pro­ceed or call it in for fur­ther scru­tiny on na­tional se­cu­rity grounds.</p>
    <p>If that path were cho­sen, the busi­ness sec­re­tary would have a fur­ther 30 days to make a de­ci­sion, ex­tend­able by an­other 45 days in the most com­plex cases.</p>
