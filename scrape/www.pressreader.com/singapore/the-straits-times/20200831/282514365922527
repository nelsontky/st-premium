    <p>TAIPEI • A cloud es­capes into the air as 80-year-old Tai­wanese street food ven­dor Wu Huang-yi lifts the lid on a gi­ant steam­ing bas­ket to un­veil a pip­ing hot batch of two dozen buns.</p>
    <p>It is lunchtime at Taipei’s Huaxi Night Mar­ket – the cap­i­tal’s old­est – and a queue has al­ready formed at Wu’s stall, with din­ers ea­ger to taste the pork belly whose aroma wafts from a steel pot bub­bling in the cramped kitchen.</p>
    <p>Wu, a self-taught chef, per­fected his meat mari­nade more than 20 years ago. He still goes to the mar­ket at 5am ev­ery day to hand­pick the pork belly, which he stews for hours in a special blend of in­gre­di­ents.</p>
    <p>“My gua bao (buns) are dif­fer­ent from oth­ers. They’re all hand­made. They’re tasty be­cause they are so soft and yet chewy,” he says.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing is done ac­cord­ing to tra­di­tion and that’s why the buns taste good.”</p>
    <p>Also known in Tai­wanese as hor ga ter (tiger bites pig), the gua bao is a cir­cu­lar flat steamed bun, which is folded in half and stuffed with braised meat, co­rian­der, salted veg­etable and ground peanuts.</p>
    <p>Its shape re­sem­bles the an­cient Chi­nese boat-shaped in­got, so gua bao sig­ni­fies pros­per­ity and is of­ten served at wed­ding ban­quets and cor­po­rate func­tions.</p>
    <p>Wu sells his gua bao for less than US$2 (S$2.70) each at his stall, where his whole family, in­clud­ing his wife, three adult chil­dren and a grand­son help out.</p>
    <p>His hard work and ded­i­ca­tion have fi­nally paid off – this month he was recog­nised by Miche­lin and awarded a place on the food guide’s Bib Gour­mand list, which is given to eater­ies that serve a top-class three­course meal for less than NT$1,000 (S$46.30).</p>
    <p>Tai­wan – which has a rich lo­cal culi­nary tra­di­tion as well as a huge ar­ray of cuisines brought to the is­land by main­land Chi­nese im­mi­grant com­mu­ni­ties – now has well over 200 en­tries on Miche­lin’s list.</p>
