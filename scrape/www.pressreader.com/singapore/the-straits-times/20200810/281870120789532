    <p>NEW DELHI • In­dian in­ves­ti­ga­tors yes­ter­day be­gan ex­am­in­ing the black box of the Boe­ing-737 that over­shot a run­way on its sec­ond at­tempt to land, killing 18 peo­ple in the coun­try’s worst avi­a­tion ac­ci­dent in a decade.</p>
    <p>The Air In­dia Ex­press plane was fly­ing home In­di­ans stranded in Dubai due to the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, and was caught in heavy rain. It over­shot the run­way of Cali­cut In­ter­na­tional Air­port near the city of Kozhikode in the south­ern state of Ker­ala last Friday.</p>
    <p>The air­craft, which had 190 pas­sen­gers and crew aboard, plunged more than 10m down an em­bank­ment and broke in two.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view with Reuters part­ner ANI yes­ter­day, Mr Arun Ku­mar, head of In­dia’s Direc­torateGen­eral of Civil Avi­a­tion, said the coun­try would open the re­cov­ered tran­scripts to in­ter­na­tional in­ves­ti­ga­tors, as well as the plane’s man­u­fac­turer, Boe­ing.</p>
    <p>“Only af­ter con­duct­ing a thor­ough and un­bi­ased probe can we tell what ex­actly hap­pened,” Mr Ku­mar said.</p>
    <p>The 2,700m run­way at the air­port is known as a “ta­ble-top”, an avi­a­tion term for run­ways with steep drops at one or both ends.</p>
    <p>They leave lit­tle room for er­ror should a pi­lot over­shoot the run­way, ei­ther through hu­man er­ror or me­chan­i­cal fail­ure.</p>
    <p>Late last Satur­day, Mr Ku­mar told CNN-News18 in an in­ter­view that the pi­lot made an aborted land­ing at­tempt into a head­wind and then made a sec­ond ap­proach with a tail­wind, land­ing 1,000m down the run­way.</p>
    <p>An air traf­fic con­trol of­fi­cial fa­mil­iar with the crash con­firmed this ver­sion of events, adding that it is un­usual to at­tempt a land­ing at the air­port with a tail­wind, which is typ­i­cally used for take-offs.</p>
    <p>“The length of the run­way in Cali­cut is around 2,700m and the plane touched the ground af­ter cross­ing 1,000m of the length, leav­ing less room to bring the air­craft to a halt,” the of­fi­cial, who de­clined to be named as he is not autho­rised to speak to the me­dia, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“It was windy and rainy and the run­way sur­face was wet. In such in­stances the weather is dy­namic,” he added.</p>
    <p>“An air­craft typ­i­cally lands and de­parts in a head­wind as a tail­wind in­creases the plane’s speed.”</p>
    <p>In­dia’s civil avi­a­tion min­is­ter, how­ever, has warned against spec­u­la­tion over the cause of the crash.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter Hardeep Singh Puri ac­knowl­edged that is­sues had been “rou­tinely red flagged” by the civil avi­a­tion author­ity about the run­way where the crash hap­pened, but they had been ad­dressed by the air­port owner.</p>
    <p>He added on Twit­ter: “I will en­cour­age all to ex­er­cise pa­tience and re­frain from mak­ing spec­u­la­tive ob­ser­va­tions bordering on the ir­re­spon­si­ble.”</p>
    <p>Some 149 peo­ple are still in lo­cal hospi­tals af­ter the crash.</p>
    <p>Res­cue of­fi­cials said it was “a miracle” that fuel that leaked did not catch fire.</p>
    <p>Ker­ala has been hit by deadly floods and land­slides in re­cent days and heavy down­pours had been fall­ing for sev­eral hours at Kozhikode as the plane landed.</p>
    <p>The plane re­peat­edly jumped up and down in buf­fet­ing winds be­fore the land­ing, sur­vivors told In­dian tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for Air In­dia did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to a re­quest for com­ment.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has al­ready said it will pay com­pen­sa­tion to the fam­i­lies of the de­ceased.</p>
