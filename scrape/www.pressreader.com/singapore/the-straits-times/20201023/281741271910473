    <p>TEHERAN Iran and Rus­sia have strongly de­nied Amer­i­can al­le­ga­tions of hav­ing taken ac­tions to in­flu­ence pub­lic opin­ion ahead of the Nov 3 US pres­i­den­tial elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Wash­ing­ton had ac­cused Iran of send­ing “spoofed” e-mails to Amer­i­cans “de­signed to in­tim­i­date vot­ers, in­cite so­cial un­rest and dam­age” Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump less than two weeks be­fore the vote.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to US di­rec­tor of na­tional in­tel­li­gence John Rat­cliffe, Iran had also dis­trib­uted a video that im­plies that peo­ple could send in fraud­u­lent bal­lots, in­clud­ing from out­side the United States.</p>
    <p>The US au­thor­i­ties “have put for­ward a base­less claim on the verge of the coun­try’s elec­tion so that they would ad­vance their un­demo­cratic and pre­de­fined sce­nario through shift­ing the blame”, Iran’s for­eign min­istry spokesman Saeed Khat­i­bzadeh said yes­ter­day in a state­ment, after sum­mon­ing the Swiss am­bas­sador.</p>
    <p>The Swiss em­bassy in Teheran has han­dled US in­ter­ests in Iran, since ties were cut in the af­ter­math of the 1979 Is­lamic rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>Mr Khat­i­bzadeh called the ac­cu­sa­tions “fab­ri­cated and clumsy”, and re­peated Iran’s stance that it favours nei­ther Mr Trump nor his Demo­cratic chal­lenger Joe Bi­den.</p>
    <p>Ten­sions be­tween Wash­ing­ton and Teheran have risen sharply since 2018, when Mr Trump uni­lat­er­ally pulled the US out of a land­mark nu­clear agree­ment with Iran and reim­posed crip­pling sanc­tions in a pol­icy of “max­i­mum pres­sure” against the Is­lamic re­pub­lic.</p>
    <p>Also point­ing the fin­ger at Rus­sia, Mr Rat­cliffe said both Teheran and Moscow seek to “com­mu­ni­cate false in­for­ma­tion to reg­is­tered vot­ers that they hope will cause con­fu­sion, sow chaos, and un­der­mine con­fi­dence in Amer­i­can democ­racy”.</p>
    <p>The Krem­lin dis­missed the ac­cu­sa­tions as “ab­so­lutely ground­less”.</p>
    <p>“Ac­cu­sa­tions are rain­ing down ev­ery day. All of them are ab­so­lutely ground­less, they are not based on any­thing,” Krem­lin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told re­porters.</p>
    <p>The US an­nounce­ment came after reg­is­tered Demo­cratic vot­ers re­ported re­ceiv­ing per­son­ally ad­dressed e-mails in the name of the Proud Boys mili­tia, and from an In­ter­net do­main linked to the Proud Boys. A num­ber of vot­ers in Florida and other key bat­tle­ground states said they had re­ceived the mes­sages.</p>
    <p>“You will vote for Trump on elec­tion day or we will come after you,” the e-mails said.</p>
    <p>Mr Rat­cliffe, with FBI di­rec­tor Christo­pher Wray be­side him, did not ex­plain how the Rus­sians and Ira­ni­ans had ob­tained the voter in­for­ma­tion, or how the Rus­sians might be us­ing it.</p>
