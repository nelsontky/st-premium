    <p>Tai­wan and the United States have signed a me­moran­dum of un­der­stand­ing (MOU) to es­tab­lish an­nual eco­nomic talks, which Tai­wanese Pres­i­dent Tsai Ing-wen called a “win-win sit­u­a­tion”.</p>
    <p>The MOU was signed af­ter an in­au­gu­ral round of eco­nomic talks in Wash­ing­ton on Fri­day. The talks kicked off the Eco­nomic Pros­per­ity Part­ner­ship Di­a­logue that was an­nounced by the US in late Au­gust.</p>
    <p>The US del­e­ga­tion was led by Un­der Sec­re­tary of State for Eco­nomic Growth, En­ergy and the En­vi­ron­ment Keith Krach. His Septem­ber visit to Tai­wan saw Chi­nese war planes cross­ing the mid­line of the Tai­wan Strait – which nor­mally serves as an of­fi­cial buf­fer be­tween the is­land and the main­land – in a se­ries of drills seen to de­ter the US from boost­ing its ties with Tai­wan. China con­sid­ers self-ruled Tai­wan its own territory with no right to for­mal re­la­tions with other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Tai­wan sent Deputy Min­is­ter of Eco­nomic Af­fairs Chen Ch­ernchyi and a team for the di­a­logue.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a state­ment from</p>
    <p>US Depart­ment of State, the di­a­logue cov­ered top­ics in­clud­ing “the Clean Net­work, 5G net­works and telecom­mu­ni­ca­tions se­cu­rity, sup­ply chains, in­vest­ment screen­ing, clean in­fra­struc­ture co­op­er­a­tion, re­new­able en­ergy, global health, science and tech­nol­ogy, and women’s eco­nomic em­pow­er­ment, ed­u­ca­tion and en­trepreneur­ship”.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai said in a Face­book post that the talks were able to achieve nine ac­com­plish­ments be­tween both sides, list­ing the ink­ing of the MOU and the es­tab­lish­ment of a task force for a fu­ture eco­nomic part­ner­ship, among oth­ers. She is op­ti­mistic about fur­ther col­lab­o­ra­tions with the US, and many in Tai­wan also see this as a pos­i­tive step to­wards sign­ing a free trade agree­ment (FTA) with the US. Her hash­tag for the Face­book post reads “#TrueFriend­sTrueDevel­op­ment” in Chi­nese, cel­e­brat­ing the stride for­ward for Tai­wan.</p>
    <p>Ms Tsai re­ceived back­lash from op­po­si­tion par­ties in Tai­wan when she said in Au­gust that the is­land would be green-light­ing the im­port of US pork, as well as US beef from cat­tle aged 30 months and above. The crit­i­cism is rooted in food safety con­cerns as the live­stock is fed rac­topamine, an ad­di­tive to pro­mote lean meat.</p>
    <p>Three days af­ter Ms Tsai’s Aug 28 an­nounce­ment on the pol­icy change on rac­topamine, the US an­nounced that the two sides will launch the di­a­logue.</p>
    <p>Dr Chen Fang-yu, a po­lit­i­cal an­a­lyst who writes for the non-profit re­search site, US-Tai­wan Watch, said: “The US needs an ally to stim­u­late eco­nomic growth and keep China in check, while Tai­wan has proven it­self an es­sen­tial eco­nomic part­ner in the high tech, biomed­i­cal and 5G in­dus­tries.”</p>
    <p>It may be a while un­til an FTA with the US ac­tu­ally ma­te­ri­alises, so for Tai­wan, th­ese talks with the US are a way to gain mo­men­tum on a global stage, Dr Chen told The Sun­day Times. He added that the form­ing of a task force in Fri­day’s talks was a high­light.</p>
    <p>“This means the talks are be­ing re­alised on a ‘work­ing level,’ tak­ing it be­yond just dis­cus­sions be­tween high-level of­fi­cials,” he said.</p>
    <p>China’s of­fi­cial Xin­hua news agency, in a com­men­tary, said yes­ter­day Wash­ing­ton is once again play­ing the Tai­wan card against China. This time, the ruse is the so-called Eco­nomic Pros­per­ity Part­ner­ship Di­a­logue held on Fri­day, it said. “Play­ing the Tai­wan card is toxic to cross-strait peace and sta­bil­ity,” it added.</p>
    <p>Next month, US En­vi­ron­men­tal Pro­tec­tion Agency head An­drew Wheeler is likely to visit Tai­wan. He will be the third high-rank­ing US of­fi­cial to visit Tai­wan this year, fol­low­ing Sec­re­tary of Health and Hu­man Ser­vices Alex Azar, and Mr Krach.</p>
