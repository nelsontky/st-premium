    <p>Amid the sweep­ing changes to the ex­ter­nal en­vi­ron­ment brought on by the coro­n­avirus pan­demic, Sin­ga­pore has been fac­ing a sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenge to breathe life into and main­tain the sta­tus of two key hubs which the broader econ­omy de­pends on: Changi Air­port and the sea port. Th­ese are not just vi­tal nodes in the global sup­ply chain, but their con­tin­ued func­tion­ing is also in­ex­tri­ca­bly tied to jobs and Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic com­pet­i­tive­ness. Newly ap­pointed Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung graph­i­cally de­scribed them as “two lungs” that nour­ish the rest of the body and which add vi­tal­ity and com­pet­i­tive­ness to all sec­tors of the coun­try. Th­ese range from re­tail to lo­gis­tics to ad­vanced en­gi­neer­ing. At every level of th­ese sec­tors are jobs and the well-be­ing of the em­ploy­ees car­ry­ing out th­ese tasks.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s sea port, the vi­tal se­cond lung that pow­ers an econ­omy whose trade is more than three times its gross do­mes­tic prod­uct, ap­pears to have man­aged bet­ter so far. It has, for in­stance, re­tained its po­si­tion as the world’s most im­por­tant ship­ping hub on the Xin­hua-Baltic In­ter­na­tional Ship­ping Cen­tre De­vel­op­ment In­dex for the sev­enth con­sec­u­tive year. A joint dec­la­ra­tion in late April by the port au­thor­i­ties in 20 coun­tries across three con­ti­nents to keep ports open for trade amid the pan­demic has also been im­por­tant to safe­guard unim­peded mar­itime trade.</p>
    <p>Avi­a­tion, how­ever, has not fared as well. Take</p>
    <p>Rolls-Royce, for in­stance. It pro­duced 200 jet en­gines here last year and was plan­ning to raise pro­duc­tion be­fore the pan­demic struck. Now, that strong de­mand is in ques­tion as air travel evap­o­rates and jobs are be­ing shed. The sharp slump in Sin­ga­pore Air­lines’ (SIA) stock price and vis­i­tor ar­rivals also re­flects the dis­mal sit­u­a­tion of the broader avi­a­tion and tourism sec­tors.</p>
    <p>Given Sin­ga­pore’s lo­ca­tion, it was al­ways a chal­lenge to be the pre­mier air hub be­tween Asia and Europe and the west coast of the United States. Nev­er­the­less, it had won that po­si­tion, aided in no small part by as­tute poli­cies, the ease of con­nec­tiv­ity from here, and the spurt in de­mand from South and South-east Asia. This was why a fifth ter­mi­nal was planned for Changi Air­port. Now, plans for T5 have been put back for at least two years and op­er­a­tions at two ex­ist­ing ter­mi­nals have been sus­pended. Mean­while, SIA has vowed to un­der­take a fun­da­men­tal relook of its busi­ness.</p>
    <p>Ne­go­ti­at­ing travel bub­bles and re­cip­ro­cal green lanes is pro­ceed­ing cau­tiously given the resur­gence of the virus in many coun­tries. But chal­lenges in main­tain­ing Sin­ga­pore’s avi­a­tion hub sta­tus will re­main, not least in the ever-present is­sue with neigh­bours over man­ag­ing airspace. Main­tain­ing Sin­ga­pore’s sta­tus is not a given in the post-Covid-19 world. Chang­ing de­mands and the na­tional mood of coun­tries in and around the re­gion will test Sin­ga­pore’s re­flexes and re­sponses.</p>
