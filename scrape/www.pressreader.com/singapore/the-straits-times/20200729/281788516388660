    <p>NEW YORK • The New York health au­thor­i­ties will in­ves­ti­gate a Hamp­tons char­ity con­cert opened by Gold­man Sachs chief David Solomon and head­lined by The Chainsmok­ers af­ter footage showed crowds of par­ty­go­ers.</p>
    <p>Gov­er­nor An­drew Cuomo said he was ap­palled by “egre­gious so­cial dis­tanc­ing vi­o­la­tions” seen in videos of l ast Satur­day night’s event in Southamp­ton. “We have no tol­er­ance for the il­le­gal and reck­less en­dan­ger­ment of public health,” Mr Cuomo said, not­ing that the Depart­ment of Health will lead the in­quiry.</p>
    <p>The event was held in a field and billed as the “Safe & Sound drivein con­cert” with at­ten­dees ex­pected to en­joy the mu­sic by their cars and in des­ig­nated spots.</p>
    <p>About 2,000 peo­ple turned up for the show which was opened by Gold­man’s chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer, who moon­lights as DJ D-Sol, and elec­tronic dance mu­sic duo The Chainsmok­ers as the main act.</p>
    <p>Videos shared by rev­ellers ap­peared to show groups gath­er­ing near the stage. Some con­cert­go­ers with­out masks con­gre­gated out­side cars to party with friends.</p>
    <p>Southamp­ton Town Su­per­vi­sor Jay Sch­nei­der­man was one of the per­form­ers, and Southamp­ton Vil­lage Mayor Jesse War­ren was em­cee. A rep­re­sen­ta­tive for the or­gan­is­ers de­clined to com­ment.</p>
    <p>New York was once the epi­cen­tre of the coro­n­avirus pan­demic in the United States be­fore it eased there and spread to other re­gions. Of­fi­cials have been cau­tiously re­open­ing the state.</p>
    <p>The or­gan­is­ers had pledged to abide by lo­cal and state health stan­dards. They set up tem­per­a­ture checks, ar­ranged for crews to clean por­ta­ble toi­lets every 10 min­utes and made fre­quent an­nounce­ments about wear­ing masks.</p>
    <p>About 500 cars were parked in spots that cost up to US$25,000 (S$34,500), with the top tier in­clud­ing an air-con­di­tioned recre­ational ve­hi­cle and private bath­room.</p>
