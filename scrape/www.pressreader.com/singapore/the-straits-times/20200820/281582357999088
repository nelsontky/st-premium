    <p>The Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party has reap­pointed Dr Janil Puthuc­heary as party Whip and Ms Sim Ann as deputy party Whip. Separately, the govern­ment par­lia­men­tary com­mit­tees (GPCs) have also been formed, and nine of the 12 GPCs will have new chair­men.</p>
    <p>The Peo­ple’s Ac­tion Party has reap­pointed Dr Janil Puthuc­heary as party Whip and Ms Sim Ann as deputy party Whip.</p>
    <p>Dr Janil has served as party Whip since June 6 last year, when he took over from Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing, who has held the po­si­tion since Septem­ber 2015.</p>
    <p>He is Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health as well as Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion, and MP for Pasir Ris-Pung­gol GRC.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim is Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion plus Na­tional Devel­op­ment, and an MP for Hol­landBukit Timah GRC.</p>
    <p>The role of a party Whip is to en­sure good com­mu­ni­ca­tion in the party ranks, con­trib­ute to the smooth run­ning of its par­lia­men­tary ma­chin­ery and serve as dis­ci­plinar­ian.</p>
    <p>The Whip also en­sures that the party’s MPs vote in Par­lia­ment ac­cord­ing to the party’s po­si­tion. But at times, this per­son can “lift the Whip”, al­low­ing party mem­bers to vote ac­cord­ing to their con­science.</p>
    <p>Ms Sim told The Straits Times yes­ter­day: “I’m look­ing for­ward to get to know our new par­lia­men­tary col­leagues and am hon­oured to con­tinue sup­port­ing party Whip Dr Janil Puthuc­heary as his deputy.”</p>
    <p>Separately, the govern­ment par­lia­men­tary com­mit­tees (GPCs) have also been formed, the PAP said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>Al­most all 12 of the com­mit­tees will have new chair­men, with the ex­cep­tion of three: de­fence and for­eign af­fairs, fi­nance and trade and in­dus­try, and so­cial and fam­ily devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>These three GPCs will con­tinue to be chaired, in that cor­re­spond­ing or­der, by Mr Vikram Nair, a Sem­bawang GRC MP; Mr Liang Eng Hwa, MP for Bukit Pan­jang SMC; and Mr Seah Kian Peng, an MP for Marine Pa­rade GRC, said the PAP.</p>
    <p>Mr Liang, who will head the largest GPC with nine mem­bers, told The Straits Times that while Sin­ga­pore was for­tu­nate to have a strong fis­cal po­si­tion, it needed to en­gi­neer new ar­eas of growth.</p>
    <p>“We will need to re­set cer­tain parts of the econ­omy and pivot into new op­por­tu­ni­ties,” he added.</p>
    <p>“I am happy to have GPC mem­bers with deep and vary­ing ex­per­tise in busi­nesses and the econ­omy. We look for­ward to frank and con­struc­tive en­gage­ments with the Min­istry of Fi­nance, and Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try, as we tackle the se­vere eco­nomic chal­lenges ahead.”</p>
    <p>Set up by the PAP in 1987, the GPCs – whose mem­bers are PAP back­benchers – scru­ti­nise leg­is­la­tion and pol­icy pro­grammes. They also serve as an ad­di­tional feed­back chan­nel on govern­ment poli­cies.</p>
    <p>Their ap­point­ments take ef­fect on Mon­day, when the 14th Par­lia­ment of Sin­ga­pore opens with an ad­dress by Pres­i­dent Hal­imah Ya­cob.</p>
    <p>MacPher­son MP Tin Pei Ling, pre­vi­ously deputy chair­man of the GPC for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion, will chair it in place of Mr Cedric Foo, who has re­tired from pol­i­tics.</p>
    <p>Ms Tin told The Straits Times that as the coro­n­avirus pan­demic speeds up dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion, it is im­por­tant that Sin­ga­pore is “ready for the fu­ture and con­tin­ues to have a place in the world”.</p>
    <p>“Hence, my top­ics of in­ter­est will in­clude dig­i­tal econ­omy, smart na­tion and dig­i­tal readi­ness – so that even the more vul­ner­a­ble will not be in­ad­ver­tently left be­hind.”</p>
    <p>Bis­han-Toa Payoh GRC MP Sak­tiandi Su­paat, who will head the GPC for Trans­port, said he will look at how trans­port poli­cies can stim­u­late growth – by adopt­ing new tech­nolo­gies, boost­ing sus­tain­abil­ity, and en­abling so­cial in­clu­sion through bet­ter ac­cess to trans­port ser­vices, es­pe­cially for the el­derly and the vul­ner­a­ble.</p>
    <p>“The next few years will be about the post-Covid-19 era and how Sin­ga­pore’s hub sta­tus can be sus­tained and en­hanced,” he added.</p>
    <p>Po­tong Pasir MP Si­toh Yih Pin, who will head the GPC for Cul­ture, Com­mu­nity and Youth, said: “These port­fo­lios will shape the heart and soul of who we are as a na­tion in the fu­ture. I very much look for­ward to my new role.”</p>
    <p>Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng will head the GPC for Sus­tain­abil­ity and the En­vi­ron­ment, in line with the re­nam­ing of the min­istry last month.</p>
    <p>He said: “I look for­ward to ac­tively de­bate cli­mate changes and sus­tain­abil­ity is­sues... and en­sure that all of us will have a healthy planet to live in.”</p>
    <p>He also said that he will adopt a con­sul­ta­tive ap­proach and en­sure Sin­ga­pore­ans’ voices are heard in Par­lia­ment.</p>
