    <p>It has been four months since Mr Terry Mariyadas, 35, was sep­a­rated from his fam­ily, and his wife is wor­ried sick.</p>
    <p>Their daily video calls end in teary good­byes and the stress of hav­ing to care for her two young sons – aged two and al­most one – with­out her hus­band, has caused Madam Kanamah Rathi­nasamy, 33, to lose al­most 30kg.</p>
    <p>“When­ever I see her (over video chat) I will re­mind her to eat,” said Mr Mariyadas about his wife.</p>
    <p>Mr Mariyadas is Malaysian. He is also the sole bread­win­ner of the fam­ily and has been stuck in Sin­ga­pore since mid-March, when Malaysia’s move­ment con­trol or­der was en­acted.</p>
    <p>It is still un­clear whether he will be al­lowed to visit his fam­ily in Jo­hor Baru un­der the re­cently an­nounced re­cip­ro­cal green lane and pe­ri­odic com­mut­ing ar­range­ment. But the se­nior tech­ni­cian is hope­ful that his wait to see his fam­ily will soon be over.</p>
    <p>“If I could just see them and hold my sons, that is all that I want. Just a few days back home is enough,” he said.</p>
    <p>He used to com­mute daily across the bor­der on mo­tor­bike, but since the bor­der closed four months ago, he has been stay­ing at the Four Sea­sons Ho­tel Sin­ga­pore, which is his em­ployer.</p>
    <p>Mr Mariyadas missed the last moments with his 70-year-old mother and her fu­neral in May. He had tried to ap­ply for an en­try per­mit to re­turn home for the rites but was un­suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>“One of the first things I will do when I re­turn is to visit my mother’s tomb­stone. I need to tell her that I’m sorry for not be­ing able to send her off,” he said.</p>
    <p>He hopes that he will not miss an­other im­por­tant event com­ing up – the first birth­day of his youngest son on Aug 28.</p>
    <p>“For now, I tell my wife to pre­tend that I’m work­ing in a far­away place like the Mid­dle East or the UK, and that I can only re­turn home once a year to visit,” he said.</p>
