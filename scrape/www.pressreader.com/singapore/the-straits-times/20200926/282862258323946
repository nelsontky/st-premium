    <p>SEOUL • Ms Kim Eun-hee wants to com­plete her col­lec­tion of mem­o­ra­bilia of Korean boy band BTS by bid­ding more than US$120,000 (S$165,040) to buy shares in the group’s mu­sic la­bel Big Hit En­ter­tain­ment in South Korea’s hottest ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO), which could even shake money mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Fer­vour is build­ing among diehard South Korean BTS fans to se­cure at least one share of the K-pop band’s la­bel as or­der books for next month’s list­ing opened this week.</p>
    <p>“I’m adding my sup­port to BTS by buy­ing shares. It will add to my col­lec­tion here,” Ms Kim, 51, said in the BTS-themed cafe she runs in Seoul, which is filled with BTS mer­chan­dise, from a 47-inch wide photo of band mem­ber Jin to toys de­signed by the group.</p>
    <p>Big Hit En­ter­tain­ment is bet­ting that go­ing pub­lic will be a smash hit rid­ing on the suc­cess of the sev­en­mem­ber band, who have be­come the first South Korean group to reach No. 1 on the US Bill­board Hot 100 sin­gles chart with catchy song Dy­na­mite.</p>
    <p>There is al­ready in­sa­tiable de­mand for new share list­ings from South Korean re­tail in­vestors – known as “Ants” – be­cause gov­ern­ment stim­u­lus ef­forts to bol­ster the econ­omy af­ter the coro­n­avirus cri­sis has flooded mar­kets with cash.</p>
    <p>An­a­lysts pre­dict Big Hit will take the crown as South Korea’s hottest IPO, one that the cen­tral bank is watch­ing closely as a mas­sive over­sub­scrip­tion of shares could send rip­ples through short-term money mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Big Hit is look­ing to raise as much as 962.6 bil­lion won (S$1.1 bil­lion) in the IPO that is set to be South Korea’s largest in three years. The of­fer­ing of about 7.1 mil­lion new shares is pegged at 105,000 - 135,000 won a share.</p>
    <p>But the stock’s val­u­a­tion is less of an is­sue for Ms Kim and other BTS fans – who are called Army. Ms Kim and four other fans bid­ding for shares said they would be lucky to pick up just one share even if they place bids for tens of thou­sands of dol­lars be­cause of the ex­pected strong re­tail de­mand.</p>
    <p>The Big Hit list­ing is ex­pected to make the seven BTS mem­bers mul­ti­mil­lion­aires, as chief ex­ec­u­tive of­fi­cer Bang Si-hyuk in Au­gust gave them 68,385 shares each.</p>
    <p>Some BTS fans plan to buy Big Hit shares for them­selves on band mem­bers’ birth­days or other an­niver­saries.</p>
    <p>Ms Alice Park, a 28-year old banker, is tak­ing out a per­sonal loan of “a cou­ple of hun­dred grand” to make a bid.</p>
    <p>Kim Seo-hyeon, a 12-year-old BTS fan in Seoul, has asked her par­ents to buy her one share so she could meet the mem­bers of the band at a fu­ture share­hold­ers meet­ing.</p>
    <p>“I don’t know about stock val­u­a­tions. I know my op­pas (BTS band mem­bers) are rich, but I hope me buy­ing shares make them even richer, so that they can buy some­thing nice to wear. That would make me happy.”</p>
