    <p>•</p>
    <p>SANETA (In­dia) Delhi’s smog cri­sis headed for a new toxic peak yes­ter­day, but farm­ers are re­fus­ing to stop the stub­ble burn­ing that is widely blamed for the poi­sonous clouds en­gulf­ing the In­dian cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>Air pol­lu­tion in parts of the city reached “se­vere” lev­els yes­ter­day – a day af­ter US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump de­scribed In­dian air as “filthy” – with mon­i­tor­ing agencies warn­ing con­di­tions would worsen in the next two days be­cause of the lack of wind.</p>
    <p>Teams in states around Delhi, home to some 20 mil­lion peo­ple, are hunt­ing the il­le­gal stub­ble burn­ers, even driv­ing around coun­try roads at night when most fires are started.</p>
    <p>In the past month, some 1,265 farm­ers have been fined in Pun­jab alone, ac­cord­ing to se­nior pol­lu­tion of­fi­cer Krunesh Garg, but satel­lite de­tec­tors have recorded more than 12,000 fires in the state.</p>
    <p>In an ef­fort to step up the cam­paign, the gov­ern­ment is of­fer­ing sub­sidised ma­chines to clear rice pad­dies, and farm­ers who are caught start­ing fires are blocked for bank loans.</p>
    <p>But thick grey clouds of smoke that carry deadly par­ti­cles to the world’s most pol­luted cap­i­tal can still be seen ev­ery­where.</p>
    <p>Be­cause of Delhi’s po­si­tion and weather pat­tern, the city is choked by deadly smog every win­ter.</p>
    <p>Farm­ers like Mr Param­jeet Singh say they un­der­stand in­hab­i­tants’ health con­cerns but con­sider stub­ble burn­ing a “nec­es­sary evil” in the race to clear fields for fresh crops.</p>
    <p>“The smoke is also bad for our eyes and lungs, but we don’t have the money to buy ma­chines that can clear the crop residue,” said Mr Singh, 42, in Saneta vil­lage, lo­cated about 230km north-west of Delhi, in Pun­jab state.</p>
    <p>“And why go af­ter only farm­ers? There are so many pol­lut­ing in­dus­tries in Delhi and Pun­jab but only we get blamed.”</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to state air qual­ity mon­i­tors, farm fire smoke ac­counted for 56 per cent of Delhi’s pol­lu­tion in 2018 and 44 per cent last year.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties say the share has fallen fur­ther this year, but not enough to ease the cri­sis in Delhi.</p>
    <p>Some ex­perts say the wors­en­ing</p>
    <p>smog is be­cause of the num­ber of cars on the roads, as well as con­struc­tion and in­dus­try ac­tiv­i­ties around the city.</p>
    <p>Delhi Chief Min­is­ter Arvind Ke­jri­wal has de­clared a “war on pol­lu­tion”, putting up bill­boards across the city, while plac­ard-wield­ing ac­tivists urge driv­ers to turn off their en­gines when they halt at traf­fic lights.</p>
    <p>But ex­perts say po­lit­i­cal will to tackle pol­lu­tion is still lack­ing, with the cen­tral gov­ern­ment and Delhi, Pun­jab and Harayana states un­able to agree on tough ac­tion.</p>
    <p>And this year, farm­ers, who rep­re­sent a pow­er­ful vot­ing bloc, are up­set over new laws they fear will let large pri­vate re­tail­ers con­trol pric­ing.</p>
    <p>“Yes, we are an­gry and we don’t care about the gov­ern­ment. Many farm­ers I know burnt the crop residue mainly to spite the gov­ern­ment,” said 62-year-old farmer Yash­pal Singh.</p>
    <p>“If the farm­ers wanted, they could have lis­tened to the gov­ern­ment but they chose not to.”</p>
