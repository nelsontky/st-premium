    <p>Of­fice rents in the cen­tral re­gion re­mained un­changed in the sec­ond quar­ter af­ter a 0.8 per cent drop in the first, but prices for space fell, data showed yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>It noted that buy­ing of­fices in that zone was cheaper af­ter val­ues con­tracted 4.3 per cent af­ter they eased 4 per cent in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>There was a to­tal sup­ply of about 668,000 sq m gross floor area of space in the pipe­line as of June 30, com­pared with 682,000 sq m as of March 31.</p>
    <p>Oc­cu­pied of­fice space de­creased by 55,000 sq m of net let­table area in the sec­ond quar­ter, a much big­ger drop than the 7,000 sq m de­crease in the first.</p>
    <p>But the stock of space ex­panded by 43,000 sq m of net let­table area af­ter ris­ing 33,000 sq m in the first quar­ter.</p>
    <p>This drove the is­land­wide va­cancy rate for of­fices to 12.1 per cent as of June 30, up from 11 per cent as of March 31.</p>
    <p>But re­tail rents in the cen­tral re­gion shrank 3.5 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, com­pared with the first three months, when they had eased 2.3 per cent.</p>
    <p>Prices of re­tail space in the cen­tral re­gion fell 1.5 per cent in the sec­ond quar­ter, a smaller drop than the 3.1 per cent de­crease in the first.</p>
    <p>The amount of oc­cu­pied re­tail space con­tracted by 93,000 sq m of net let­table area in the sec­ond quar­ter, com­pared with a 43,000 sq m drop in the first.</p>
    <p>But the stock of re­tail space rose by 4,000 sq m of net let­table area in the sec­ond quar­ter, com­pared with a de­crease of 15,000 sq m in the pre­vi­ous quar­ter.</p>
    <p>This sent the is­land­wide va­cancy rate to 9.6 per cent as of June 30, up from 8 per cent as of March 31.</p>
