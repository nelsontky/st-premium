    <p>LON­DON • Eng­lish ac­tor Ian McK­ellen (right), who played the wiz­ard Gan­dalf in the Lord Of The Rings movies (2001 to 2003), said he was eu­phoric af­ter re­ceiv­ing his first dose of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vac­cine and urged ev­ery­one who was of­fered the jab to ac­cept it.</p>
    <p>The state-run Na­tional Health Ser­vice (NHS), which is run­ning Britain’s mass coro­n­avirus vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme, posted sev­eral pic­tures of McK­ellen, clad in a blue T-shirt and a rain­bow-striped scarf, giv­ing a thumbs-up as he re­ceived the shot.</p>
    <p>“It’s a very special day. I feel eu­phoric,” McK­ellen, 81, was quoted as say­ing in one NHS post which he retweeted.</p>
    <p>“I would have no hes­i­ta­tion in rec­om­mend­ing it to any­one. I feel very lucky to have had the vac­ci­na­tion.”</p>
    <p>Nearly 140,000 peo­ple have re­ceived their first dose of the Pfizer vac­cine in Britain since roll­out be­gan on Dec 8.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple over the age of 80 are in the high­est-pri­or­ity group.</p>
    <p>A star of Bri­tish stage and screen since the 1960s, McK­ellen at­tained a new level of global fame in the 2000s when he ap­peared as Gan­dalf in the movies, which were based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s nov­els and di­rected by Peter Jack­son.</p>
    <p>He is the lat­est Bri­tish celebrity to go pub­lic about re­ceiv­ing the Covid-19 vac­cine, as part of a col­lec­tive ef­fort to re­as­sure mem­bers of the pub­lic who may be har­bour­ing doubts about the jab’s safety.</p>
    <p>Chef and cook­ery writer Prue Leith, 80, who presents pop­u­lar tele­vi­sion show The Great Bri­tish Bake Off (2010 to present), also posted a pic­ture of her­self re­ceiv­ing a shot.</p>
    <p>It is not known whether Queen El­iz­a­beth, 94, and her hus­band Prince Philip, 99, have been vac­ci­nated yet.</p>
    <p>The Times re­ported the roy­als may “let it be known” once they have re­ceived the vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The Queen is highly re­spected in Britain and her back­ing would be a pow­er­ful mes­sage to counter anti-vac­ci­na­tion mis­in­for­ma­tion.</p>
