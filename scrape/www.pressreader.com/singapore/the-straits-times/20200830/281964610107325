    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Chad­wick Bose­man, star of the ground-break­ing su­per­hero movie Black Pan­ther (2018), has died af­ter a four-year bat­tle with colon can­cer, his pub­li­cist said on Friday.</p>
    <p>Bose­man, 43, never pub­licly dis­cussed his con­di­tion and con­tin­ued to work on ma­jor Hol­ly­wood films dur­ing and be­tween “count­less” oper­a­tions and chemo­ther­apy, his family said in a statement.</p>
    <p>“It was the honour of his ca­reer to bring King T’Challa to life in Black Pan­ther. A true fighter, Chad­wick per­se­vered through it all,” they said, adding that the ac­tor died in his home “with his wife and family by his side”.</p>
    <p>Bose­man played the first black su­per­hero to get his own stand­alone film in the record-break­ing Marvel fran­chise with Black Pan­ther. The movie, set in the fic­tional African king­dom of Wakanda, was adored by crit­ics and au­di­ences, be­com­ing the first comic book film to be nom­i­nated for best pic­ture at the Os­cars and gross­ing over US$1 bil­lion (S$1.36 bil­lion) world­wide.</p>
    <p>The Marvel film was cel­e­brated as an im­por­tant cul­tural mo­ment for its mainly black cast, and for sub­vert­ing stereo­types by de­pict­ing a pros­per­ous African coun­try that takes in refugees and ex­tends its cul­ture and tech­nol­ogy to poorer na­tions.</p>
    <p>Ear­lier in his ca­reer, Bose­man played black icons Jackie Robinson and James Brown in the movies 42 (2013) and Get On Up (2014), re­spec­tively. Iron­i­cally, Friday was</p>
    <p>Jackie Robinson Day in the US.</p>
    <p>The news of Bose­man’s death sent shock waves through Hol­ly­wood and around the world.</p>
    <p>“The true power of @chad­wick­bose­man was big­ger than any­thing we saw on screen,” wrote Demo­cratic pres­i­den­tial can­di­date Joe Bi­den. “From the Black Pan­ther to Jackie Robinson, he in­spired gen­er­a­tions and showed them they can be any­thing they want – even su­per­heroes.”</p>
    <p>Mr Bi­den’s run­ning mate Ka­mala Har­ris said she was “heart­bro­ken” and ref­er­enced Howard Univer­sity in Wash­ing­ton, nick­named Bi­son, where they both studied.</p>
    <p>“My friend and fel­low Bi­son, Chad­wick Bose­man was bril­liant, kind, learned and humble,” she tweeted. “He left too early but his life made a dif­fer­ence. Send­ing my sin­cere con­do­lences to his family.”</p>
    <p>Bose­man’s fi­nal post on Twit­ter, on Aug 12, was to con­grat­u­late Ms Har­ris the day af­ter she was an­nounced as the Demo­cratic can­di­date for vice-pres­i­dent in Novem­ber’s elec­tion.</p>
    <p>Chris Evans, who played Cap­tain Amer­ica in the Marvel se­ries, tweeted: “Chad­wick was spe­cial. A true orig­i­nal. He was a deeply com­mit­ted and con­stantly cu­ri­ous artist. He had so much amaz­ing work still left to cre­ate. I’m end­lessly grate­ful for our friend­ship.”</p>
    <p>An­other of Bose­man’s Marvel co-stars, Mark Ruf­falo, tweeted: “Brother, you were one of the all­time greats and your great­ness was only be­gin­ning. Lord love ya.”</p>
    <p>Both Evans and Ruf­falo signed off their tweets: “Rest in power, King.”</p>
    <p>NAACP, the lead­ing civil rights or­gan­i­sa­tion in the US, praised Bose­man for “show­ing us how to con­quer ad­ver­sity with grace” and “to walk as a King, with­out los­ing the com­mon touch”.</p>
    <p>“#RestInPowe­r #Black­Pan­therFor­ever,” its tweet con­cluded.</p>
    <p>Bose­man re­cently ap­peared in</p>
    <p>Spike Lee’s Viet­nam War film, Da 5 Bloods, and was set to ap­pear in a se­quel to Black Pan­ther due in 2022.</p>
    <p>He shrugged off doubters who tried to con­vince him not to give the su­per­hero an African ac­cent.</p>
    <p>Bose­man said at the time: “There was a time pe­riod where peo­ple would ask me ques­tions about whether or not an au­di­ence could sit through a movie with a lead char­ac­ter that spoke with that ac­cent. I be­came adamant about the fact that it’s not true.”</p>
    <p>Born in South Carolina, the son of a nurse and an up­hol­stery en­tre­pre­neur, Bose­man has roots in the West African state of Sierra Leone.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Marvel, he was best known for his ac­claimed por­trayal of the leg­endary Robinson in Brian Hel­ge­land’s movie 42, which had the high­est-gross­ing de­but for a base­ball movie in Hol­ly­wood his­tory.</p>
    <p>He was also lav­ished with praise for his in­ter­pre­ta­tion of soul singer Brown in Get On Up, earn­ing in­clu­sion among the top 10 per­for­mances of 2014 by Time mag­a­zine.</p>
