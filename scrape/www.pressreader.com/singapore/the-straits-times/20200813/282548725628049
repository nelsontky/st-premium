    <p>What would hap­pen if you let a bunch of teenage boys run the govern­ment?</p>
    <p>The award-win­ning doc­u­men­tary Boys State, which pre­mieres on Ap­ple TV+ to­mor­row, fol­lows some of the thou­sand or so Texas high school­ers who gather for an an­nual mock-govern­ment ex­er­cise where they com­pete in elec­tions to build a state govern­ment.</p>
    <p>And what hap­pens sug­gests that, po­lit­i­cally, Gen­er­a­tion Z may be as cut-throat and cyn­i­cal as any other, al­though there are glim­mers of hope that they might do things dif­fer­ently than to­day’s lead­ers.</p>
    <p>Hus­band and wife Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine di­rected and pro­duced the film, which won the United States Grand Jury Prize for doc­u­men­taries when it pre­miered at the Sun­dance Film Fes­ti­val ear­lier this year.</p>
    <p>In a re­cent video chat, they and some of the young men de­picted in the film spoke to The Straits Times about what they wit­nessed dur­ing the week-long pro­gramme which, along with the fe­male equiv­a­lent, Girls State, is held in states across the US.</p>
    <p>The film-mak­ers, who also col­lab­o­rated on the award-win­ning doc­u­men­tary The Overnighte­rs (2014), about an oil boom in a small town, ad­mit they had some pre­con­cep­tions when they de­cided to make a movie about the Boys State pro­gramme in Texas in 2017.</p>
    <p>Moss says: “We thought, well, ‘This is Texas, and this pro­gramme has been around a long time and sounds pretty con­ser­va­tive and tra­di­tional.’ And to some ex­tent, that was what we en­coun­tered.</p>
    <p>“But while you could imag­ine a kind of Lord Of The Flies ex­pe­ri­ence where it quickly de­volves – and you see (that) in the be­gin­ning of the film – it be­comes some­thing more com­pli­cated.”</p>
    <p>He brings up spe­cific in­di­vid­u­als. “Can­di­dates like Stephen Garza and Re­nee Otero, whose pol­i­tics are not con­ser­va­tive and who are young men of colour, are able to nav­i­gate that space, find com­mon­al­ity with this group and, in Stephen’s case, sum­mon them to their bet­ter an­gels.</p>
    <p>“That was un­ex­pected and in­ter­est­ing and it al­lowed us to make a more fully di­men­sional, pris­matic look at the ten­sions and pos­si­bil­i­ties of rep­re­sen­ta­tive democ­racy within this mi­cro­cosm of na­tional pol­i­tics.”</p>
    <p>On dis­play, too, were the re­al­i­ties of pol­i­tics: Machi­avel­lian ma­noeu­vring, horse-trad­ing and po­lit­i­cal ex­pe­di­ency.</p>
    <p>The boys fea­tured are asked if they feel that, de­spite this, their gen­er­a­tion will be dif­fer­ent and do bet­ter when it comes to prob­lems and di­vi­sions.</p>
    <p>Robert Mac­Dougall, 20, says he is “cau­tiously op­ti­mistic” that it will. “What we saw at Boys State was that abil­ity to com­pro­mise, have civil con­ver­sa­tions and find com­mon paths to the same goal.</p>
    <p>“And I’ve been op­ti­mistic see­ing what young peo­ple have been do­ing around the na­tion re­cently. Young peo­ple right now are in the streets protest­ing for Black Lives Mat­ter and mak­ing their voices heard, and it’s very im­por­tant that they get in­volved in the po­lit­i­cal process and pub­lic ser­vice and make our na­tion bet­ter.”</p>
    <p>But he and Garza cau­tion that there are peo­ple on both the left and right of the po­lit­i­cal spec­trum who are un­will­ing to meet in the mid­dle.</p>
    <p>Garza, 19, points out: “It only takes a few peo­ple to cre­ate grid­lock and pre­vent progress from be­ing made.”</p>
    <p>Yet Otero, 19, is hope­ful. “In the older gen­er­a­tion, peo­ple rely so heav­ily on po­lit­i­cal lead­ers and the process, and I think this new gen­er­a­tion is more par­tic­i­pa­tory.</p>
    <p>“We see that now with the way young peo­ple are en­gag­ing on Covid-19 and Black Lives Mat­ter. I think this gen­er­a­tion is un­like pre­vi­ous ones.”</p>
    <p>But Ben Fe­in­stein, a self­de­scribed po­lit­i­cal junkie and stu­dent of his­tory, is more pes­simistic.</p>
    <p>The 19-year-old says: “If you look at the 1960s, the youth of Amer­ica were also en­gag­ing in the coun­ter­cul­ture. So I don’t think there’s any­thing new about what Gen Z is do­ing – it’s just dig­i­tal and it looks big­ger be­cause we can spread it over the In­ter­net.”</p>
    <p>He adds: “We’ve grown up in very tu­mul­tuous times – we were born into the Sept 11, 2001, at­tacks and the war on ter­ror, then the fi­nan­cial cri­sis and the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion – so I’m sure we’ll do some­thing dif­fer­ently.</p>
    <p>“But I think ev­ery gen­er­a­tion faces its unique set of prob­lems and short­com­ings, so I feel it’s too early to tell.”</p>
