    <p>LON­DON • Bri­tain yes­ter­day be­came the first coun­try to ap­prove a coro­n­avirus vac­cine de­vel­oped by Ox­ford Univer­sity and As­traZeneca, hop­ing that rapid ac­tion would help it stem a surge of in­fec­tions driven by a highly con­ta­gious vari­ant of the virus.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Boris John­son’s govern­ment, which has al­ready or­dered 100 mil­lion doses of the vac­cine, said it had ac­cepted a rec­om­men­da­tion from the Medicines and Health­care prod­ucts Reg­u­la­tory Agency to grant emer­gency au­tho­ri­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>The ap­proval is a vin­di­ca­tion for a shot seen as es­sen­tial for mass im­mu­ni­sa­tions in the de­vel­op­ing world as well as in Bri­tain, but does not elim­i­nate ques­tions about trial data that make it un­likely to be ap­proved so rapidly in the Euro­pean Union or the United States.</p>
    <p>“The NHS (Na­tional Health Ser­vice) will be able to de­liver these shots into peo­ple’s arms at the speed at which it can be man­u­fac­tured,” Health Sec­re­tary Matt Han­cock said. “I am also now, with this ap­proval this morn­ing, highly con­fi­dent that we can get enough vul­ner­a­ble peo­ple vac­ci­nated by the spring that we can now see our route out of this pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>Mr John­son called the ap­proval a “triumph for Bri­tish sci­ence”.</p>
    <p>Mr Han­cock said hun­dreds of thou­sands of doses would be avail­able to ad­min­is­ter next week in Bri­tain, which is al­ready rolling out Pfizer and BioNTech’s vac­cine.</p>
    <p>The Ox­ford vac­cine has been found in tri­als to be less ef­fec­tive than the Pfizer shot but, cru­cially for coun­tries with more ba­sic health in­fra­struc­ture, can be stored and trans­ported un­der nor­mal re</p>
    <p>frig­er­a­tion, rather than su­per­cooled to mi­nus 70 deg C.</p>
    <p>In­dia is keen to start ad­min­is­ter­ing the new shot next month. Chile is also in­ter­ested.</p>
    <p>Bri­tain has set it­self apart from other Western coun­tries with its fast-track ap­proach to vac­ci­na­tions, hav­ing green-lighted the Pfizer vac­cine weeks be­fore the</p>
    <p>EU’s Euro­pean Medicines Author­ity (EMA) did so.</p>
    <p>Un­cer­tainty has swirled over the most ef­fec­tive dos­ing pat­tern for the Ox­ford vac­cine since it re­leased data last month show­ing a 90 per cent suc­cess rate for a half­dose fol­lowed by a full dose, but only 62 per cent – still usu­ally more than enough for reg­u­la­tors – for two full doses.</p>
    <p>The more suc­cess­ful out­come emerged, by ac­ci­dent, in a much smaller num­ber of par­tic­i­pants, all aged un­der 55, and more tests are on­go­ing to see if that rate holds up in a big­ger set of vol­un­teers.</p>
    <p>As­traZeneca did not spec­ify which reg­i­men had been ap­proved yes­ter­day. The EMA has not yet re­ceived full data on the As­traZeneca vac­cine and is un­likely to be able to ap­prove it next month. A de­ci­sion from the US reg­u­la­tor is also not im­mi­nent.</p>
