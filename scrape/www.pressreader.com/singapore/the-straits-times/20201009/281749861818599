    <p>A two-year-old Sin­ga­porean girl who re­turned from Nepal on Sept 25 was among five im­ported Covid-19 cases re­ported yes­ter­day, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>Among the oth­ers were a 31-yearold French en­gi­neer who ar­rived from France on Mon­day for a short­term work project, and a 32-yearold Ja­panese na­tional who ar­rived on Tues­day.</p>
    <p>The three were tested while they were serv­ing their 14-day stay­home no­tices. None had symp­toms.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing two im­ported cases were crew mem­bers of a ship which ar­rived from Malaysia on Sept 23. They did not dis­em­bark and were iso­lated af­ter one of them was con­firmed to have Covid-19. They were taken by am­bu­lance to the hos­pi­tal af­ter their test re­sults came back pos­i­tive.</p>
    <p>No new cases in the com­mu­nity were re­ported yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing four of the nine new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, which took Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 57,849.</p>
    <p>Among them, one was iden­ti­fied ear­lier as a con­tact of pre­vi­ous cases and was al­ready in quar­an­tine. The re­main­ing three cases were de­tected through sur­veil­lance test­ing.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of one case per day in the past two weeks.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained sta­ble at an av­er­age of fewer than one case a day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 44 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 57,653 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 35 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, in­clud­ing one in crit­i­cal con­di­tion in the in­ten­sive care unit, while 119 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
