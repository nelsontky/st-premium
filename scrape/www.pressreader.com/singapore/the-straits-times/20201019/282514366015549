    <p>• Bol­ly­wood star San­jay Dutt (left), whose life has been so colour­ful and tragic that it be­came the sub­ject of a biopic, con­firmed he has can­cer fol­low­ing weeks of me­dia spec­u­la­tion.</p>
    <p>“This is a re­cent scar of my life, but I’ll beat it. I’ll be out of this can­cer soon,” Dutt, 61, said, point­ing to a scar run­ning from his left eye­brow across the side of his head in an In­sta­gram video posted by Bol­ly­wood hair­styl­ist Aalim Hakim.</p>
    <p>Dutt also con­firmed he would start shoot­ing his next movie, K.G.F: Chap­ter 2, next month.</p>
    <p>In Au­gust, he had is­sued a state­ment on so­cial me­dia say­ing he was “tak­ing a short break for some med­i­cal treat­ment”.</p>
    <p>The Hindi-lan­guage ac­tor, nick­named “Deadly Dutt”, served time in prison for pos­sess­ing guns supplied by gang­sters re­spon­si­ble for bomb­ings in Mumbai in 1993 and has also bat­tled drug ad­dic­tion.</p>
    <p>Dutt shot to fame in the mid-1980s in a string of ac­tion movies in which he per­formed his own stunts, earn­ing him his nick­name.</p>
    <p>But he was also strug­gling with sub­stance abuse – in­clud­ing heroin and co­caine – that was said to have been sparked by the pain of los­ing his mother, In­dian screen icon Nar­gis Dutt, to can­cer.</p>
    <p>Af­ter a break, he re­turned with a string of hits in the late 1980s and early 1990s in­clud­ing Jeete Hain Shaan Se (We Live With Style, 1987), Saa­jan (Beloved, 1991) and Khal Nayak (Vil­lain, 1993).</p>
    <p>His life took a dra­matic turn when he was ar­rested af­ter the or­ches­trated bomb­ings in Mumbai, then called Bom­bay, in March 1993 that killed 257 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Dutt was even­tu­ally con­victed in 2006 of hold­ing guns supplied by mafia bosses who had car­ried out the blasts. He was given a six-year term and spent 18 months in prison be­fore be­ing re­leased on bail in 2007, pend­ing an ap­peal. In 2013, his con­vic­tion was up­held, but his prison term was cut to five years. He was sent back to jail be­fore be­ing re­leased early in 2016.</p>
    <p>Dutt has been mar­ried three times. His first wife, ac­tress Richa Sharma, was di­ag­nosed with a brain tu­mour in 1987 and died in 1996. Dutt’s sec­ond mar­riage to model Rhea Pil­lai ended in 2008 and he mar­ried for­mer ac­tress Many­ata the same year.</p>
    <p>In 2018, a film about his life, Sanju, was re­leased cov­er­ing the pe­riod from just be­fore Dutt’s Bol­ly­wood de­but with ro­man­tic drama Rocky in 1981 to his re­lease from jail in 2016.</p>
