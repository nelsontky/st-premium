    <p>There have been around 80 cases of dis­putes in­volv­ing com­muters who did not mask up on pub­lic trans­port since April, said the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity yes­ter­day. About 40 peo­ple have been fined for not do­ing so, it added. The other cases still have their out­comes pend­ing or were re­solved with­out po­lice in­volve­ment.</p>
    <p>There have been around 80 cases of dis­putes in­volv­ing com­muters who did not mask up on pub­lic trans­port since April, said the Land Trans­port Au­thor­ity (LTA) yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>About 40 peo­ple have been fined for not do­ing so, it added.</p>
    <p>The other cases still have their out­comes pend­ing, or were re­solved with­out po­lice in­volve­ment.</p>
    <p>The wear­ing of masks in pub­lic was made com­pul­sory in Sin­ga­pore on April 14 as a mea­sure against the coro­n­avirus. Fail­ure to do so may re­sult in a fine of $300 for first-time of­fend­ers, and re­peat of­fend­ers face higher fines or pros­e­cu­tion in court.</p>
    <p>Dis­putes be­tween com­muters and pub­lic trans­port work­ers over mask rules have been in the spot­light af­ter videos of ar­gu­ments were up­loaded and shared on so­cial me­dia.</p>
    <p>The LTA noted that while most com­muters com­ply af­ter be­ing re­minded to wear their masks cor­rectly, some have re­fused to co­op­er­ate and re­sorted to ver­bal and phys­i­cal ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>“We do not con­done such be­hav­iour to­wards our pub­lic trans­port work­ers, and of­fend­ers will be dealt with ac­cord­ing to the law,” said its spokesman.</p>
    <p>On Sun­day, a com­muter on a Cir­cle Line train was caught on video hurl­ing vul­gar­i­ties at SMRT staff who had urged him to wear his mask prop­erly.</p>
    <p>“The com­muter ver­bally abused the staff and con­tin­ued the abu­sive be­hav­iour while trav­el­ling in the net­work,” said Ms Mar­garet Teo, the rail op­er­a­tor’s chief com­mu­ni­ca­tions of­fi­cer.</p>
    <p>The 51-year-old man was sub­se­quently ar­rested by the po­lice at Khatib MRT sta­tion. The po­lice said he reeked of al­co­hol, and was ar­rested for caus­ing an­noy­ance to the pub­lic when drunk un­der Sec­tion 14(2)(b) of the Liquor Con­trol Act and for us­ing abu­sive lan­guage against a pub­lic ser­vant.</p>
    <p>In a sep­a­rate in­ci­dent last week, Face­book user Ni­mal De Silva posted a 15-minute live video of him­self ver­bally abus­ing a bus driver who would not let him board a pub­lic bus wear­ing a neck gaiter in­stead of a face mask.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Health does not rec­om­mend the use of neck gaiters and ban­dan­nas as masks.</p>
    <p>The LTA noted that while most com­muters com­ply af­ter be­ing re­minded to wear their masks cor­rectly, some have re­fused to co­op­er­ate and re­sorted to ver­bal and phys­i­cal ha­rass­ment.</p>
    <p>“We do not con­done such be­hav­iour to­wards our pub­lic trans­port work­ers, and of­fend­ers will be dealt with ac­cord­ing to the law,” said its spokesman.</p>
    <p>$300</p>
    <p>The fine that first-time of­fend­ers may face for not wear­ing a mask in pub­lic. Re­peat of­fend­ers face higher fines or pros­e­cu­tion in court.</p>
