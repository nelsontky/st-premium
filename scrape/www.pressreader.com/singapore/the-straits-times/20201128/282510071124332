    <p>Ms Su­laimah Mah­mood re­calls with brac­ing clar­ity the mo­ment last year when India dropped the bomb­shell that it would pull out of the Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP).</p>
    <p>Eight years’ worth of hard­fought ne­go­ti­a­tions flashed past the eyes of Sin­ga­pore’s chief RCEP ne­go­tia­tor, as In­dian Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi said his “con­science” would not per­mit him to let India join the mega trade pact.</p>
    <p>“I lit­er­ally froze from shock and dis­ap­point­ment,” said Ms Su­laimah, 63, a se­nior direc­tor at the Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try (MTI).</p>
    <p>Teams from all 16 par­tic­i­pat­ing coun­tries had gath­ered in Bangkok and worked past mid­night, on the eve of India’s bomb­shell an­nounce­ment, to iron out the fi­nal kinks. New Delhi had faced in­tense do­mes­tic op­po­si­tion, out of fear that an in­flux of cheap Chi­nese goods would dec­i­mate its in­fant in­dus­tries.</p>
    <p>But there had been no sign from India that it would take the dras­tic step of walk­ing away, said Ms Su­laimah who, with five other ne­go­tia­tors from MTI, spoke to re­porters on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>One of them, Ms Giselle Lee, 27, said a key worry was that India’s with­drawal would trig­ger a domino ef­fect and cause other par­ties to pull out, as some had been very keen to have India on board.</p>
    <p>India’s pull­out was just one of the many twists and turns in the RCEP jour­ney that was steered by Asean, said Ms Su­laimah.</p>
    <p>She was quick to clar­ify the nar­ra­tive in some in­ter­na­tional me­dia that the process was China-led.</p>
    <p>Al­though the RCEP ne­go­ti­a­tions were of­fi­cially launched only in 2012, Asean had be­gun to think about the emerg­ing re­gional ar­chi­tec­ture as far back as 2006.</p>
    <p>This was after it had com­pleted all its Plus One free trade agree­ments (FTAs), which re­fer to its trade pacts with in­di­vid­ual na­tions like China, Ja­pan and South Korea.</p>
    <p>Said Ms Su­laimah: “What we’ve done with RCEP is to have one rule for each prod­uct that each coun­try can use for the other 14 par­ties.”</p>
    <p>The group­ing also came up with a set of guid­ing prin­ci­ples and ob­jec­tives for the trade pact in 2012.</p>
    <p>Ms Su­laimah said the re­al­ity is that agri­cul­tural prod­ucts like rice and sugar con­tinue to be sen­si­tive for some Asean mem­bers. Many are keen to pro­tect their farm­ers from a po­ten­tial in­flux of cheap im­ports. At the same time, coun­tries that did not have FTAs with each other then, such as China, Ja­pan and South Korea, were locked in bi­lat­eral talks, which added to the com­plex­ity of ne­go­ti­at­ing RCEP.</p>
    <p>Au­to­mo­tives were an­other stick­ing point, since there are many ma­jor au­to­mo­tive pro­duc­ers in the re­gion, said Mr Tay Lide, 33, who ne­go­ti­ated the goods, ser­vices and in­vest­ment chap­ters of the RCEP.</p>
    <p>He noted that most coun­tries had dif­fi­culty re­tain­ing the same set of ne­go­tia­tors for the eight years. “Ev­ery time some­one moves and we deal with a new per­son­al­ity, it is a new process of try­ing to gain trust.”</p>
    <p>The 46-strong Sin­ga­pore team is a mix of old and new faces from across gov­ern­ment agen­cies.</p>
    <p>Given the grow­ing im­por­tance of dig­i­tal trade in Asia, many had hoped RCEP would in­clude stronger pro­vi­sions that would lower bar­ri­ers for e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>While Sin­ga­pore, too, wanted a more am­bi­tious e-com­merce chap­ter, one must un­der­stand some of the least de­vel­oped economies did not even have e-com­merce reg­u­la­tions to be­gin with, said Ms Su­laimah. “But we man­aged to reach a land­ing zone where we said: ‘Okay, let’s con­clude this be­cause if we con­tinue for an­other two or three years, it will not get bet­ter.’”</p>
