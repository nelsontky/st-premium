    <p>For­mer foot­baller David Beck­ham, famed as much for his skills on the pitch as for his looks, is not too vain to ap­pear 30 years older for a good cause.</p>
    <p>In a cam­paign video to raise aware­ness of malaria, Beck­ham, 45, is dig­i­tally aged to look like he is in his 70s, with a full head of grey­ing hair, a bushy beard and deeply etched lines on his face.</p>
    <p>Un­sur­pris­ingly, even with wrinkly skin, age spots and faded tat­toos, he still looks dash­ing as a sil­ver fox.</p>
    <p>Re­leased on Thurs­day, the one-minute video by Malaria No More UK starts off with an aged Beck­ham, speak­ing with a mes­sage from the fu­ture, about how the dis­ease has been hy­po­thet­i­cally erad­i­cated.</p>
    <p>As he con­tin­ues, the years fall away and he is back in the present with the cam­paign slo­gan: “Malaria must die, so mil­lions will live”.</p>
    <p>Shot in a green room with help from a com­pany run by Hol­ly­wood di­rec­tor Ri­d­ley Scott, the film uses a mix­ture of tra­di­tional visual ef­fects and a new pro­pri­etary tech­nol­ogy known as Char­la­tan.</p>
    <p>The face-swop­ping pro­gram utilises ma­chine learn­ing to merge faces in real time, en­abling it to add decades to Beck­ham’s face while re­tain­ing his unique char­ac­ter­is­tics.</p>
    <p>As a fa­ther of four, Beck­ham says: “The fight against malaria is a cause close to my heart be­cause the dis­ease re­mains a huge killer of chil­dren and we have the op­por­tu­nity to change that in our life­time.”</p>
    <p>One of the world’s old­est and dead­li­est dis­eases, malaria claims the life of a child ev­ery two min­utes, ac­cord­ing to the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>It is a life-threat­en­ing trop­i­cal dis­ease spread by mos­qui­toes and most deaths oc­cur in Africa, where 250,000 chil­dren die from the dis­ease an­nu­ally.</p>
    <p>Beck­ham has been in­volved in the or­gan­i­sa­tion since 2009 and is a found­ing mem­ber of Malaria No More UK’s lead­er­ship coun­cil.</p>
    <p>At its launch more than a decade ago, he played ten­nis at Wem­b­ley Sta­dium over the world’s long­est mos­quito net with ten­nis champ Andy Mur­ray.</p>
