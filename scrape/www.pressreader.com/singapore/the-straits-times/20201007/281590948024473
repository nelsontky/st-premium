    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s mar­itime sec­tor has re­mained re­silient de­spite global eco­nomic head­winds, with the marine fuel or bunker seg­ment hold­ing steady amid the dou­ble shocks of the Covid-19 pan­demic and fluc­tu­at­ing oil prices. Nonethe­less, the Gov­ern­ment is push­ing on with plans to do more for the sec­tor, such as step­ping up dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>The Re­pub­lic’s mar­itime sec­tor has re­mained re­silient de­spite global eco­nomic head­winds, with the marine fuel or bunker seg­ment hold­ing steady amid the dou­ble shocks of the Covid-19 pan­demic and fluc­tu­at­ing oil prices.</p>
    <p>Nonethe­less, the Gov­ern­ment is push­ing on with plans to do more for the sec­tor, said Senior Min­is­ter of State for Trans­port and For­eign Af­fairs Chee Hong Tat yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>One key plank is to step up dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion ef­forts, he said.</p>
    <p>Covid-19, Mr Chee added, has changed the way the sec­tor does business. Telecom­mut­ing and elec­tronic trans­ac­tions are now the norm in­stead of face-to-face meet­ings and pa­per trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>Adapt­ing to these changes to im­prove pro­duc­tiv­ity and cut costs is not al­ways easy, he added.</p>
    <p>With that in mind, Mr Chee said the Gov­ern­ment is ear­mark­ing $30,000 per year for each small and medium-sized en­ter­prise (SME) to cover up to 70 per cent of costs to go dig­i­tal in ar­eas such as soft­ware sub­scrip­tion, pro­fes­sional ser­vices and train­ing.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment, he added, will also meet up to 50 per cent of the SMEs’ hard­ware costs.</p>
    <p>These are part of ef­forts to keep the marine fu­els sec­tor, which pow­ers the shipping in­dus­try, prof­itable and mov­ing for­ward, he said.</p>
    <p>In his open­ing ad­dress at the Sin­ga­pore In­ter­na­tional Bunker­ing Con­fer­ence and Ex­hi­bi­tion, Mr Chee said: “From Jan­uary to Au­gust 2020, bunker sales vol­ume in Sin­ga­pore was 5.3 per cent higher at 32.9 mil­lion tonnes, com­pared with the same pe­riod in 2019.”</p>
    <p>Marine fuel, he added, is “an in­te­gral part” of the mar­itime in­dus­try as it lets ves­sels trans­port es­sen­tial goods and sup­plies glob­ally.</p>
    <p>As part of the Sea Trans­port In­dus­try Dig­i­tal Plan un­der the SMEs Go Dig­i­tal pro­gramme, there will be a new road map for the marine fu­els sec­tor. Road maps for ship agency and har­bour craft are al­ready in place.</p>
    <p>Mr Chee said the sec­tor will move to­wards the use of elec­tronic bunker de­liv­ery notes to au­to­mate the col­lec­tion of data us­ing what are called mass flow me­ters.</p>
    <p>The me­ters – in­tro­duced in 2017 – re­move the need to man­u­ally gauge the amount of fuel trans­ferred. They are also more ac­cu­rate in mea­sur­ing the quan­tity trans­ferred.</p>
    <p>The elec­tronic bunker de­liv­ery notes also cut down the pa­per­work needed to trans­fer the data from the me­ter, and pre­vent ma­nip­u­la­tion of data.</p>
    <p>Said Mr Chee: “We have made good progress. At least two bunker­ing com­pa­nies are now con­duct­ing their proof of con­cept to fully in­te­grate and au­to­mate mass flow me­ter data into de­liv­ery notes. We look for­ward to more com­pa­nies com­ing on board.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore, he added, is com­mit­ted to main­tain­ing the in­tegrity of its bunker­ing sec­tor.</p>
    <p>“We are not per­fect. We have our share of black sheep and cases of mal­prac­tice, but what is clear is that we will not hes­i­tate to take firm ac­tion and re­voke bunker­ing li­cences of er­rant com­pa­nies,” he said.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s reg­u­la­tory frame­work, he added, makes it the only port in the world that im­ple­ments a li­cens­ing regime for bunker sup­pli­ers and bunker craft op­er­a­tors.</p>
    <p>In his speech, Mr Chee also touched on con­cerns that dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion will re­move jobs in the mar­itime in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“Yes, some rou­tine jobs will dis­ap­pear, but many new jobs will be cre­ated. And most im­por­tant of all, jobs will change for the bet­ter, be safer and pay more,” he said. To that end, firms and work­ers can tap a raft of train­ing grants and reskilling pro­grammes, he added.</p>
    <p>In terms of sus­tain­abil­ity, Sin­ga­pore has been de­vel­op­ing the in­fras­truc­ture to sup­port the use of liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas (LNG), Mr Chee said. LNG is a fuel that can cut car­bon diox­ide emis­sions from ships, and this helps the in­dus­try meet global tar­gets on re­duc­ing sul­phur and green­house gas emis­sions, he added.</p>
    <p>He said the Mar­itime and Port Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MPA) has is­sued two LNG bunker sup­plier li­cences, and will be launch­ing a Re­quest for Pro­posal in the com­ing weeks to is­sue more li­cences to meet the grow­ing de­mand.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day MPA signed a mem­o­ran­dum of co­op­er­a­tion with the Port of Rot­ter­dam in the Nether­lands and Ja­pan’s Min­istry of Land, In­fras­truc­ture, Trans­port and Tourism to de­velop a plan for the adop­tion of fu­ture marine fu­els to sup­port de­car­bon­i­sa­tion, among other things.</p>
