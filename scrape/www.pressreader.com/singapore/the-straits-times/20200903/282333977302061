    <p>Sin­ga­pore shares ended a tad firmer, but up­side was capped by an­a­lysts’ warn­ings that the high mar­ket val­u­a­tions in­spired by the tech­nol­ogy rally in the United States may lead to profit-tak­ing.</p>
    <p>In­vestors were mostly side­lined ahead of the Fed­eral Re­serve’s pub­li­ca­tion of its Beige Book re­port on the state of the US’ eco­nomic health yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“We ask our­selves the same ques­tion over and over – how ex­tended are val­u­a­tions?” Mr David Ko­tok, chief in­vest­ment of­fi­cer at Cumberland Ad­vi­sors, said on Bloomberg TV. “Then we see re­ports on earn­ings, and there are pos­i­tive earn­ings sur­prises com­ing from the tech com­pa­nies – and that would sug­gest that if that mo­men­tum con­tin­ues, then in fact they are not yet over­val­ued.”</p>
    <p>In Sin­ga­pore, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s par­lia­men­tary ad­dress lent some sup­port to the mar­ket, no­tably the real es­tate in­vest­ment trusts (Reits).</p>
    <p>PM Lee said that de­spite the de­pressed eco­nomic cli­mate, where some com­pa­nies are con­sol­i­dat­ing and lay­ing off work­ers, many in­vest­ment projects want to come to Sin­ga­pore be­cause of its sta­ble gover­nance and trans­par­ent laws. These in­vest­ments are in the ar­eas of bio­med­i­cal science, in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy, in­sur­ance and fi­nance.</p>
    <p>“His speech comes at a time when busi­nesses are worried with cor­po­rate down­siz­ing. The news gives some glim­mer of hope,” said a bro­ker.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times In­dex (STI) closed at 2,539.94, up 1.39 points, or 0.05 per cent. About 1.66 bil­lion se­cu­ri­ties, worth $1.02 bil­lion, changed hands.</p>
    <p>Maple­tree Com­mer­cial Trust, Maple­tree In­dus­trial Trust, Kep­pel DC Reit, and Frasers Cen­tre­point Trust were among the Reits that saw their prices ad­vance.</p>
    <p>Tech­nol­ogy stocks con­tin­ued to firm along with the US tech stocks. Ven­ture Corp closed at $20.20, up 1.2 per cent. AEM Hold­ings closed 2.45 per cent up at $4.18.</p>
    <p>Regional mar­kets mostly edged up yes­ter­day. South Korean shares gained 0.63 per cent on con­tin­ued for­eign sell­ing. Tokyo stocks closed 0.47 per cent higher.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian shares rose 1.8 per cent yes­ter­day, its big­gest one-day per­cent­age gain since Aug 4. In­vestors looked past Aus­tralia’s big­gest eco­nomic con­trac­tion on record to fo­cus on signs of a broader eco­nomic re­cov­ery fol­low­ing up­beat man­u­fac­tur­ing data from the US and China.</p>
    <p>But Hong Kong shares slipped 0.26 per cent. China’s bench­mark Shang­hai Com­pos­ite In­dex dipped 0.17 per cent, though the Shen­zhen Com­pos­ite In­dex on China’s sec­ond ex­change added 0.27 per cent.</p>
