    <p>NEW YORK • Now that bit­coin has topped US$20,000 for the first time, should you shift your hard-earned cash into dig­i­tal cur­ren­cies? His­tory sug­gests cau­tion should be your watch­word, no mat­ter how strong the fear of miss­ing out may be.</p>
    <p>News last week that One River As­set Man­age­ment has set up a fund com­pany that will have about US$1 bil­lion in bit­coin and fel­low dig­i­tal coin ether by early next year sug­gests that in­sti­tu­tional in­vestors are start­ing to take cryp­tocur­ren­cies more se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>There’s clearly se­ri­ous money in­volved. Chief ex­ec­u­tive Eric Peters told Bloomberg News’ Erik Schatzker that bil­lion­aire hedge fund man­ager Alan Howard is buy­ing a stake in the new busi­ness, called One River Dig­i­tal As­set Man­age­ment.</p>
    <p>But be­fore you race to open a dig­i­tal wal­let, look back to what hap­pened to bit­coin the last time it ap­proached these lev­els. A surge of 1,000 per cent in 2017 took its value to US$19,000. A year later, it had dropped to less than US$3,500.</p>
    <p>Hedge fund man­agers can af­ford to dab­ble in crypto. The lan­guage Mr Peters used to de­scribe the trade is the stuff of macro hedge fund shop talk, such as the “con­vex­ity” of volatile trades that soar in re­la­tion to other in­di­ca­tors like in­ter­est rates. That’s rem­i­nis­cent of other wealthy in­vestors climb­ing aboard the band­wagon, such as Mr Paul Tu­dor Jones, who com­pared bit­coin with “in­vest­ing in Google early”.</p>
    <p>Even if they get burned on a big bet, it’s money they won’t miss.</p>
    <p>But the Robin Hood crowd – re­tail in­vestors who may have made out like ban­dits this year by trad­ing stocks from their so­fas – should be­ware a bon­fire of their van­i­ties. While bit­coin is great as a bil­lion­aire’s spec­u­la­tive play­thing, it’s hardly a use­ful dig­i­tal cur­rency or safe-haven in­vest­ment for the av­er­age punter. Few peo­ple are go­ing to buy pizza or cof­fee us­ing a method of ex­change that is ca­pa­ble of fall­ing al­most 50 per cent in United States dol­lar terms in a mat­ter of days, as it did in March when Covid-19’s first wave hit the West.</p>
    <p>Even as pay­ments com­pa­nies like Pay­Pal or Square strive to bring bit­coin trad­ing to the masses, very few mer­chants di­rectly touch the stuff. Data from Chainal­y­sis es­ti­mates that mer­chants made up only about 1 per cent of cryp­tocur­rency ac­tiv­ity in North Amer­ica be­tween mid-2019 and mid-2020, while ex­changes ac­counted for al­most 90 per cent.</p>
    <p>None of this both­ers the cham­pi­ons of “dig­i­tal gold”, who push the nar­ra­tive that bit­coin serves as some kind of metaphor­i­cal mat­tress un­der which ev­ery­one should stuff rapidly de­pre­ci­at­ing dol­lars or eu­ros.</p>
    <p>But how safe is this safe haven? A study by the Kansas City Fed com­par­ing bonds, gold and bit­coin be­tween 1995 and Fe­bru­ary this year found that Trea­suries be­haved “con­sis­tently” as a safe haven, gold did so “oc­ca­sion­ally” and bit­coin got a “never”. The ar­ti­fi­cial scarcity that un­der­pins bit­coin – from its min­ing al­go­rithm to the be­hav­iour of “Hodlers”, who refuse to aban­don their in­vest­ment no mat­ter how low it goes – helps push its price higher in the boom times; it does noth­ing to pre­vent a tum­ble when whales cash out. Those who fol­low in the foot­steps of Mr Peters, Mr Howard and Mr Jones will have to hope they’re in this for the long haul.</p>
