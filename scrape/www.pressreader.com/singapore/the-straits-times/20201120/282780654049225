    <p>•</p>
    <p>The de­layed Warner Bros su­per­hero se­quel Won­der Woman 1984 will pre­miere on HBO Max and in the­atres si­mul­ta­ne­ously from Christ­mas Day in the United States, the stu­dio an­nounced on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>The de­ci­sion to re­lease the ea­gerly awaited movie on the company’s re­cently launched stream­ing plat­form rep­re­sents a gam­ble for a film which cost a re­ported US$200 mil­lion (S$269 mil­lion) and comes as Hol­ly­wood scram­bles to re­spond to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t an easy de­ci­sion and we never thought we’d have to hold on to the re­lease for such a long time, but Covid rocked all of our worlds,” wrote star Gal Gadot on her social media ac­counts.</p>
    <p>She added: “You can watch it in the­atres (they’re do­ing an amaz­ing job keep­ing it safe) and you can also watch it on HBO Max from your homes. Send­ing you my love. Please keep safe and wear a mask.”</p>
    <p>Won­der Woman 1984’s launch date was moved sev­eral times and is the last big-bud­get ac­tion film on this year’s sched­ule.</p>
    <p>The movie, which was orig­i­nally due to launch in June, will hit the­atres in other coun­tries a week ear­lier, start­ing on Dec 16. The re­lease date for Sin­ga­pore has not been con­firmed.</p>
    <p>Be­fore the pandemic, block­buster movies ran only on the big screen for a theatri­cal win­dow of 90 days, but with the­atres closed in many parts of the US, in­clud­ing New York and Los An­ge­les, dis­trib­u­tors have been forced to in­no­vate.</p>
    <p>The move comes af­ter Dis­ney re­leased Mu­lan on Dis­ney+ in Septem­ber, but un­like that launch, Won­der Woman 1984 will be of­fered at no ex­tra cost to sub­scribers of Warner’s ri­val stream­ing plat­form for one month.</p>
    <p>“As we nav­i­gate these un­prece­dented times, we’ve had to be in­no­va­tive in keep­ing our busi­nesses mov­ing for­ward while con­tin­u­ing to su­per-serve our fans,” said Warn­erMe­dia stu­dios and net­works chair­man Ann Sarnoff.</p>
    <p>The se­quel to 2017’s US$800 mil­lion-gross­ing Won­der Woman will see Gadot reprise the ti­tle role as one of the comic book uni­verse’s big­gest fe­male su­per­heroes.</p>
    <p>Chris Pine also re­turns for the se­quel, which is set in the 1980s, decades af­ter the World War I-set first movie. Patty Jenk­ins re­turns to di­rect.</p>
    <p>The orig­i­nal Won­der Woman re­ceived the best re­views of any of the in­ter­con­nected DC Uni­verse su­per­hero movies from Warner Bros, which also in­clude the lat­est Su­per­man and Bat­man films.</p>
