    <p>Straits Times as­so­ci­ate ed­i­tor Chua Mui Hoong is right that ed­u­cat­ing pedes­tri­ans, cy­clists and mo­torists re­gard­ing their re­spec­tive re­spon­si­bil­i­ties is a pre­req­ui­site to hav­ing a bi­cy­cle-friendly road sys­tem (More cy­cling lanes? Learn from PMD ex­pe­ri­ence, Oct 25).</p>
    <p>How­ever, that is not the root is­sue ham­per­ing our cy­cle-friendly as­pi­ra­tion.</p>
    <p>Our cur­rent in­fras­truc­tural and reg­u­la­tory pro­vi­sions put the com­muter-cy­clist in a quandary: be­ing a nui­sance to fast-flow­ing mo­torists on the road and a haz­ard to vul­ner­a­ble pedes­tri­ans off-road.</p>
    <p>While I agree with Mr Steven Lim, pres­i­dent of the Safe Cy­cling Task Force, that right of way per se is not a pro­duc­tive ap­proach to­wards safety, it must still be un­equiv­o­cally de­fined. Oth­er­wise, road safety cam­paigns, ad­vi­sories and reg­u­la­tions will con­tain con­flict­ing el­e­ments that con­tinue to cause con­fu­sion and non-com­pli­ance.</p>
    <p>And while I am ex­cited by the Trans­port Min­is­ter’s idea of new on-road cy­cling lanes on cur­rently un­der-used roads, with­out a de­clared com­mit­ment to pro­tect these lanes come what may, we risk a costly about-turn should they cause mas­sive con­ges­tion if road traf­fic pat­terns re­turn to what they were pre-Covid-19.</p>
    <p>All things con­sid­ered, our best bet is an off-road shared pave­ment sys­tem that not only works but is also wel­comed by both pedes­tri­ans and cy­clists.</p>
    <p>For that, we can­not sim­ply adopt over­seas ap­proaches of pro­vid­ing more and more cy­cling paths.</p>
    <p>Other coun­tries have the space to pro­vide ad­e­quate sep­a­ra­tion be­tween cy­cling and walk­ing paths. Our cy­cling paths are rou­tinely in­vaded by pedes­tri­ans, mak­ing them in­ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>In­stead, I hope the au­thor­i­ties would con­sider these two con­cepts:</p>
    <p>First is the gra­da­tion of rights. The prin­ci­pal right of way on pave­ments should be re­turned to pedes­tri­ans. Give cy­clists a sec­ondary right, sub­ject to them car­ing for the safety of pedes­tri­ans. Then in­cen­tivise them to care through the sec­ond con­cept.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond is the ap­pli­ca­tion of be­havioural in­sights to mod­u­late con­sid­er­ate cy­cling be­hav­iour through de­sign and ma­te­rial choices, in­stead of reg­u­lat­ing and pon­tif­i­cat­ing it on cy­clists.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, equip all walk­ing paths with over­tak­ing lanes along­side them that are man­age­able for cy­clists to ride on but un­pleas­ant for pedes­tri­ans to walk on. The pedes­trian-free lanes would in­cen­tivise cy­clists to evade rather than has­sle pedes­tri­ans for a way through.</p>
    <p>The same con­cept can be ap­plied along­side pedes­trian cross­ings and for di­vert­ing cy­clists to­wards the back of bus stops, to en­hance pedes­trian safety with­out in­con­ve­nienc­ing cy­clists.</p>
