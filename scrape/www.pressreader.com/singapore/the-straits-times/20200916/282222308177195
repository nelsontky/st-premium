    <p>A 31-year-old Bangladesh­i painter, who stran­gled his Indonesian girl­friend of six years after she re­fused to break up with an­other man she was see­ing, is now fac­ing the manda­tory death penalty for mur­der.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day, Ahmed Salim went on trial in the High Court for mur­der­ing domestic worker Nurhi­day­ati</p>
    <p>Wartono Su­rata, 34, in a room at the Golden Dragon Ho­tel in Gey­lang on the evening of Dec 30, 2018.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors ac­cuse him of in­tend­ing to kill the woman, as he had brought along a draw­string when they met that day.</p>
    <p>“He had been keep­ing the draw­string with him since dis­cov­er­ing the de­ceased’s new re­la­tion­ship on Dec 9, 2018,” said Deputy Pub­lic Prose­cu­tor Hay Hung Chun.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the de­fence con­tends that Ahmed had been pro­voked by the woman, who al­legedly told him: “The other man is bet­ter than you in bed and bet­ter fi­nan­cially. If you don’t be­lieve (me), I will take a video next week to show you.”</p>
    <p>Lawyer Eu­gene Thu­raisingam said the de­fence was also re­ly­ing on psy­chi­atric ev­i­dence that Ahmed’s re­spon­si­bil­ity for his ac­tions had been re­duced be­cause he was suf­fer­ing from an ad­just­ment dis­or­der at the time.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tor coun­tered that Ahmed’s claim that the woman had ut­tered those words was “fab­ri­cated” and that the ac­cused did not qual­ify for a di­min­ished-re­spon­si­bil­ity de­fence.</p>
    <p>The court heard that Ahmed and Ms Nurhi­day­ati started a re­la­tion­ship in May 2012. They went out on al­ter­nate Sun­days and had sex once a month.</p>
    <p>But in mid-2018, she started see­ing Bangladesh­i plumber Shamin Shamizur Rah­man, whom she met once a month on Sun­days.</p>
    <p>Ahmed sus­pected that Ms Nurhi­day­ati was cheat­ing on him, and after she ad­mit­ted she was dat­ing an­other man, Ahmed told his mother in Bangladesh to help him find a wife.</p>
    <p>Soon after, the pair rec­on­ciled, but quar­relled over her in­fi­delity.</p>
    <p>Once, in a ho­tel room, Ahmed pressed a towel over Ms Nurhi­day­ati’s mouth, but let go after she started strug­gling.</p>
    <p>Some time in late Oc­to­ber and early Novem­ber 2018, she be­friended an­other man on Face­book, Bangladesh­i gen­eral fit­ter Han­ifa Mo­ham­mad Abu.</p>
    <p>After she had sex with Mr Han­ifa at a ho­tel in Alju­nied, she promised her new beau that she would make a clean break with Ahmed.</p>
    <p>On Dec 9, 2018, she told Ahmed that she had a new boyfriend and that he should re­turn to Bangladesh for his ar­ranged mar­riage.</p>
    <p>On Dec 23, 2018, Ahmed and Ms Nurhi­day­ati met at a ho­tel room, where she told him she would con­tinue see­ing him, but after part­ing ways, she called him to break up with him.</p>
    <p>Ahmed con­vinced her to meet him again on Dec 30, 2018.</p>
    <p>“After they had sex at the ho­tel, the ac­cused re­peat­edly threat­ened to kill the de­ceased if she did not end her re­la­tion­ship with her new boyfriend. When the de­ceased re­fused, the ac­cused bru­tally stran­gled her with a towel around her neck,” said the prose­cu­tor.</p>
    <p>The prose­cu­tor said Ahmed put the towel around her neck, pushed the woman onto the bed, stood on the bed and stepped on one end of the towel while he pulled at the other end.</p>
    <p>He then wound the draw­string around her neck sev­eral times, tight­ened it and tied a few knots to make sure she was dead.</p>
    <p>“He twisted her head from left to right for good mea­sure,” the prose­cu­tor said.</p>
    <p>Ahmed took $30 from the dead woman, her mo­bile phone and her ez-link card, and re­turned to his dor­mi­tory at the Sungei Ten­gah Lodge.</p>
    <p>Ms Nurhi­day­ati’s body was found at about 10.15pm by a ho­tel re­cep­tion­ist.</p>
    <p>An au­topsy found the cause of death to be stran­gu­la­tion and cer­vi­cal spine in­jury.</p>
    <p>Ahmed was ar­rested at around 10.45am on Dec 31, 2018.</p>
    <p>The trial con­tin­ues to­day.</p>
