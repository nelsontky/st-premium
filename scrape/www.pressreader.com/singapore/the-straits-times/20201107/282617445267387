    <p>Af­ter be­ing in the mar­itime line for about 15 years, Mr Loo Fang Jing, 40, changed course to the semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­tur­ing in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Now a learn­ing and de­vel­op­ment trainee at semi­con­duc­tor man­u­fac­turer Glob­alFoundrie­s, he is worlds away from his pre­vi­ous work as a sailor and then a tech­ni­cal trainer in a ma­rine engi­neer­ing firm.</p>
    <p>He is one of the mid-ca­reer work­ers who took up com­pany at­tach­ments un­der the SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme, which aims to help mid-ca­reer job seek­ers gain in­dus­try-rel­e­vant ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>Mr Loo cur­rently helps with learn­ing man­age­ment sys­tems for Glob­alFoundrie­s.</p>
    <p>“In­stead of pay­ing to at­tend cour­ses, I thought I should go for an at­tach­ment with one of the com­pa­nies as I will also get work ex­pe­ri­ence, so it will be quite ben­e­fi­cial.”</p>
    <p>He ad­mit­ted that it was not easy to make the switch. For one, he</p>
    <p>BEN­E­FI­CIAL EX­PE­RI­ENCE</p>
    <p>In­stead of pay­ing to at­tend cour­ses, I thought I should go for an at­tach­ment with one of the com­pa­nies as I will also get work ex­pe­ri­ence, so it will be quite ben­e­fi­cial.</p>
    <p>MR LOO FANG JING, who cur­rently helps with learn­ing man­age­ment sys­tems for Glob­alFoundrie­s.</p>
    <p>had to take a pay cut of more than 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>“It was chal­leng­ing try­ing to pick up the ter­mi­nol­ogy and ad­just to the en­vi­ron­ment in the semi­con­duc­tor in­dus­try. Ini­tially ev­ery­thing was for­eign to me,” he said.</p>
    <p>“But I do have por­ta­ble skills like in­struc­tional de­sign, a bit of graphic de­sign and some e-learn­ing knowl­edge.”</p>
    <p>Hav­ing been with the firm for about a month, he has eight months left to the at­tach­ment and is hope­ful that the skills he picks up will make him at­trac­tive to fu­ture em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>“I was told up­front there is no guar­an­tee that I will be con­verted into a per­ma­nent hire,” he said.</p>
    <p>“I un­der­stand that it is only a trainee­ship pro­gramme. My mind­set is that I come in, I learn, I con­trib­ute wher­ever I can, such that at the end of the day I can leave on good terms.”</p>
