    <p>As the United States pres­i­den­tial elec­tion draws closer, mar­kets will in­creas­ingly brace them­selves for what could be an ac­ri­mo­nious cam­paign sea­son fol­lowed by a po­ten­tial tran­si­tion in power.</p>
    <p>The win­ner in Novem­ber will in­flu­ence a plethora of is­sues that drive fi­nan­cial mar­kets – from do­mes­tic tax­a­tion and reg­u­la­tion of Big Tech to health­care pol­icy and US geopo­lit­i­cal strat­egy in the South China Sea.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to RealClearP­ol­i­tics, former vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den is now lead­ing Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump in the polls by more than 9 per­cent­age points na­tion­ally, on av­er­age.</p>
    <p>In more nor­mal cir­cum­stances, this would ap­pear to be in­sur­mount­able odds for the Pres­i­dent, but th­ese are hardly nor­mal times, and Mr Trump is a for­mi­da­ble can­di­date with the power of the in­cum­bency be­hind him.</p>
    <p>Also, a lot can change in the next 90 or so days. The two can­di­dates’ per­for­mance in the de­bates, Mr Bi­den’s choice of vice-pres­i­dent and coro­n­avirus vac­cine de­vel­op­ments, which the cur­rent ad­min­is­tra­tion would be likely to claim credit for, can swiftly swing sen­ti­ment in ei­ther direc­tion.</p>
    <p>This elec­tion will there­fore re­main com­pet­i­tive de­spite the polling gap. En­er­gis­ing voter turnout, not just win­ning over in­de­pen­dents, will be key for both can­di­dates.</p>
    <p>So rather than po­si­tion­ing to­day for a spe­cific out­come, in­vestors should have a plan to stay in­vested while tac­ti­cally ad­just­ing to higher volatil­ity and po­ten­tially large moves among rel­a­tive win­ners and losers of pol­icy pro­pos­als.</p>
    <p>Fun­da­men­tally, the pace of eco­nomic re­open­ing and record-set­ting mon­e­tary eas­ing and fis­cal stim­u­lus re­main the more cru­cial driv­ers of risk as­sets in the com­ing months.</p>
    <p>HIGH STAKES FOR ASIA</p>
    <p>For Asia, and in par­tic­u­lar for trade-de­pen­dent economies like Sin­ga­pore, this elec­tion is likely to mat­ter more than any in the past.</p>
    <p>With US-China re­la­tions at their low­est point in more than four decades, de­vel­op­ments around trade, tech­nol­ogy and sup­ply chain re­stric­tions will be closely watched.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, Hong Kong has emerged as a new geopo­lit­i­cal flash­point as the threat of fi­nan­cial sanc­tions over the new na­tional se­cu­rity law looms.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump’s un­ortho­dox ap­proach to for­eign re­la­tions has raised ten­sions, but in­vestors should not as­sume that pressure from the US would dis­ap­pear if he were to leave of­fice.</p>
    <p>A great power ri­valry now de­fines the US-China re­la­tion­ship. A strat­egy of China con­tain­ment, driven not by pro­tec­tion­ism but by na­tional se­cu­rity con­sid­er­a­tions, has broad bi­par­ti­san sup­port and thus looks set to con­tinue, re­gard­less of who oc­cu­pies the White House.</p>
    <p>Mea­sures re­lat­ing to high-tech ex­port con­trols or the Huawei ban could well per­sist.</p>
    <p>In­vestors should brace them­selves for a fu­ture where there is in­creas­ing struc­tural de­cou­pling be­tween the two economies.</p>
    <p>How­ever, po­lit­i­cal sabre-rat­tling doesn’t read­ily trans­late into an im­me­di­ate or mean­ing­ful eco­nomic im­pact.</p>
    <p>Both the US and China are aware of the con­straints im­posed by their deep eco­nomic in­ter­de­pen­dence. Abrupt and ex­treme moves are still likely to be avoided even un­der a sec­ond Trump term, dur­ing which bi­lat­eral re­la­tions could re­main ran­corous yet func­tional.</p>
    <p>In a Bi­den pres­i­dency, re­la­tions should re­turn to a more pre­dictable foot­ing, and the de­ci­sion-mak­ing process should be less volatile.</p>
    <p>In terms of ap­proach, a Bi­den ad­min­is­tra­tion would be more mul­ti­lat­er­al­ist in gar­ner­ing the sup­port of al­lies to pressure China in­stead of go­ing at it alone. Tar­iff un­cer­tainty should also de­cline, which would boost in­vestor sen­ti­ment.</p>
    <p>That said, dif­fer­ences with China over hu­man rights is­sues might be a greater stick­ing point un­der a Demo­cratic ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>As the thrust for glob­al­i­sa­tion loses pop­u­lar sup­port, whether the US re­joins the Trans-Pa­cific Part­ner­ship un­der Mr Bi­den is now un­cer­tain.</p>
    <p>Although it re­mains of great in­ter­est for Ja­pan and other Asian economies, given the long-term im­pact on for­eign di­rect in­vest­ment, Mr Bi­den may look to rene­go­ti­ate new terms be­fore re­vi­tal­is­ing the trade pact.</p>
    <p>On bal­ance, Asian mar­kets should do bet­ter with Mr Bi­den at the helm.</p>
    <p>U.S. MAR­KET IM­PACT OF A BLUE VER­SUS RED WAVE</p>
    <p>Mr Trump and Mr Bi­den both favour greater in­fra­struc­ture spend­ing. Given the weak­ened state of the US econ­omy, the im­me­di­ate pri­or­ity of the next ad­min­is­tra­tion is likely to be to boost growth and jobs.</p>
    <p>Mr Trump favours fur­ther dereg­u­la­tion and lower taxes and an “Amer­ica first” ap­proach to in­ter­na­tional trade.</p>
    <p>In con­trast, Mr Bi­den seeks higher taxes and tighter reg­u­la­tions as well as more spend­ing on cli­mate change mit­i­ga­tion, fed­er­ally funded health­care and a higher min­i­mum wage.</p>
    <p>A “blue wave” (a uni­fied Demo­crat govern­ment) wouldn’t nec­es­sar­ily be neg­a­tive for US eq­ui­ties, as ac­cel­er­ated fis­cal spend­ing should off­set the im­pact of higher taxes.</p>
    <p>The en­ergy sec­tor would be likely to be badly hurt by tighter reg­u­la­tions, while the reg­u­la­tory tone on fi­nan­cials and Big Tech could cause some harm at the mar­gin.</p>
    <p>As­sets ex­posed to en­ergy ef­fi­ciency, smart mo­bil­ity and re­new­ables, both in the US and abroad, would ben­e­fit from Mr Bi­den’s greener agenda.</p>
    <p>A “red wave” (a uni­fied Repub­li­can govern­ment) would be slightly more pos­i­tive for US stocks.</p>
    <p>Po­ten­tial in­fra­struc­ture spend­ing, a tax cut ex­ten­sion and con­tin­ued dereg­u­la­tion would pro­vide sup­port for risk as­sets, but re­newed trade war risks and re­lated un­cer­tainty would loom large on the out­look for earn­ings.</p>
    <p>Se­lect en­ergy and fi­nan­cial com­pa­nies stand to gain as the threat of tighter reg­u­la­tion re­cedes, while space and de­fence firms could also do well in a sec­ond Trump term.</p>
    <p>WHY MAR­KETS CAN MOVE HIGHER IN THE SEC­OND HALF</p>
    <p>Risk as­sets glob­ally have re­bounded sub­stan­tially from the lows in March. And we think they should still march higher for four rea­sons: a re­peat of na­tional lock­downs is un­likely, pent-up de­mand is driv­ing eco­nomic re­cov­ery, the po­lit­i­cal con­sen­sus is now for sus­tained and large fis­cal stim­u­lus mea­sures, and the in­fi­nite liq­uid­ity pro­vided by global cen­tral banks is not go­ing away any time soon.</p>
    <p>US elec­tion out­comes are in­cred­i­bly hard to call, and poli­cies pledged dur­ing the cam­paign trail of­ten de­vi­ate upon im­ple­men­ta­tion.</p>
    <p>In­vestors should there­fore fo­cus on the longer-term fun­da­men­tals that drive earn­ings and val­u­a­tions, and avoid ex­ces­sive con­cen­tra­tion in stocks and sec­tors that could get whip­sawed by chang­ing po­lit­i­cal winds.</p>
