    <p>While Covid-19 has in­flicted much pain, it will also give rise to new job op­por­tu­ni­ties in the health­care sec­tor, in­clud­ing for those with­out health­care ex­pe­ri­ence. There will be about 7,500 jobs and 1,600 trainee­ships, at­tach­ments and skills train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties cre­ated from now un­til the end of next year, the Health Min­istry said.</p>
    <p>While Covid-19 has in­flicted much pain, it will also give rise to new job op­por­tu­ni­ties in the health­care sec­tor, with thou­sands of job and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties on of­fer for a wide spec­trum of peo­ple, in­clud­ing those with­out health­care ex­pe­ri­ence.</p>
    <p>There will be about 7,500 jobs and 1,600 trainee­ships, at­tach­ments and skills train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties cre­ated from now un­til the end of next year, the Min­istry of Health (MOH) an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Most of these po­si­tions are suit­able for fresh grad­u­ates en­ter­ing the work­force and mid-ca­reer job seek­ers – with or with­out a background in health­care.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 has taken a toll on the job mar­ket, with lower-wage and ma­ture work­ers and many mid-ca­reer Sin­ga­pore­ans hit hard.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment, on its part, is fo­cused on sav­ing and cre­at­ing jobs through var­i­ous schemes, in­clud­ing a $2 bil­lion SGUnited Jobs and Skills Pack­age to create 100,000 jobs, trainee­ships and train­ing places.</p>
    <p>The min­istry’s an­nounce­ment about the new health­care sec­tor jobs came as Health Min­is­ter Gan Kim Yong yes­ter­day said Sin­ga­pore will work to en­sure it has the re­sources to bat­tle the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Al­though it has pre­sented us with many chal­lenges, Covid-19 has also strength­ened our re­solve to trans­form health­care,” he said, shar­ing his min­istry’s plans fol­low­ing the Pres­i­dent’s Ad­dress.</p>
    <p>Mr Gan added that MOH will ramp up re­cruit­ment, even as it looks at how to im­prove the ca­reer devel­op­ment and wel­fare of health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>“We will... review salaries for com­pet­i­tive­ness as well as in recog­ni­tion of the sac­ri­fices made by our health­care work­ers,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily</p>
    <p>Devel­op­ment and Min­istry of Ed­u­ca­tion out­lined plans to con­tinue sup­port­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans, by re­view­ing and strength­en­ing so­cial safety nets and im­prov­ing so­cial mo­bil­ity, among other things.</p>
    <p>Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat said in a Face­book post yes­ter­day that the plans by the min­istries are about “keep­ing us safe, bring­ing out the best in us, and help­ing us when we are down and out”.</p>
    <p>Elab­o­rat­ing on the jobs in health­care, MOH said about a third of the 7,500 op­por­tu­ni­ties are for health­care pro­fes­sion­als, in­clud­ing nurses and al­lied health work­ers.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing two-thirds of vacancies are for var­i­ous po­si­tions, in­clud­ing sup­port care, ad­min­is­tra­tive and an­cil­lary roles, which will be suit­able for fresh grad­u­ates and mid-ca­reer job seek­ers from non­health­care back­grounds.</p>
    <p>The 1,600 trainee­ships, at­tach­ments and skills train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties will be pro­vided un­der the SGUnited ini­tia­tive, and help peo­ple ac­quire rel­e­vant work­ing ex­pe­ri­ence and skills needed in the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Em­ploy­ers and trainees will re­ceive fund­ing sup­port. Said MOH: “Em­ploy­ers can con­sider hir­ing well-per­form­ing trainees and mid­ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als at any time dur­ing or af­ter the com­ple­tion of the trainee­ship or at­tach­ment.”</p>
    <p>CIMB Pri­vate Bank­ing econ­o­mist Song Seng Wun said the op­por­tu­ni­ties will help to boost em­ploy­ment if there is an “over­whelm­ing re­sponse to work­ing in health­care”.</p>
    <p>“Per­haps this re­ces­sion will in­duce some who are sit­ting on the fence and with­out other job op­tions to con­sider health­care and al­lied in­dus­tries,” he added.</p>
    <p>“Much will de­pend on how re­cep­tive we are to work­ing in the sec­tor.”</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Jeremy Lim of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health said the sec­tor will need peo­ple with skills in ar­eas such as dig­i­tal tech­nolo­gies, e-lo­gis­tics and re­mote sen­sor de­vices as it grows and trans­forms.</p>
    <p>“Hence, there is a need for more man­power across the board – more clin­i­cal staff, more man­age­rial and ad­min­is­tra­tive sup­port, and new skill sets,” he said.</p>
    <p>There will be about 7,500 jobs and 1,600 trainee­ships, at­tach­ments and skills train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties cre­ated from now un­til the end of next year in the health­care sec­tor.</p>
    <p>About one-third of the 7,500 jobs are for health­care pro­fes­sion­als, in­clud­ing nurses and al­lied health pro­fes­sion­als.</p>
    <p>These vacancies are mainly for fresh grad­u­ates from health­care train­ing pro­grammes, as well as grad­u­ates of pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­grammes tar­geted at mid-ca­reer en­trants into the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>The re­main­ing vacancies are for roles suit­able for job seek­ers from non-health­care back­grounds. They in­clude ser­vice man­age­ment po­si­tions, such as pa­tient ser­vice as­so­ci­ates and ad­min­is­tra­tive oper­a­tions.</p>
    <p>There are also man­age­rial and ex­ec­u­tive roles avail­able in ar­eas such as fi­nan­cial man­age­ment, ac­count­ing, hu­man re­sources and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion of busi­ness pro­cesses over this year and the next.</p>
    <p>Job seek­ers can ap­ply for them through Work­force Sin­ga­pore’s (WSG) MyCa­reer­sFu­ture.sg job por­tal, and var­i­ous job fairs and re­cruit­ment plat­forms.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, 1,600 trainee­ship, at­tach­ment and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties will be pro­vided by WSG and Skill­sFu­ture Sin­ga­pore, to­gether with health­care and com­mu­nity care providers, train­ing in­sti­tu­tions and the health­care union.</p>
    <p>Fresh or re­cent grad­u­ates hop­ing to take up trainee­ships or at­tach­ments in the health­care sec­tor can tap op­por­tu­ni­ties un­der the SGUnited Trainee­ships Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Mid-ca­reer in­di­vid­u­als can ap­ply for at­tach­ments un­der the SGUnited Mid-Ca­reer Path­ways Pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The trainee­ships and at­tach­ments last between four and nine months, and are avail­able for var­i­ous roles, in­clud­ing pa­tient ser­vice as­so­ci­ates, den­tal</p>
    <p>surgery as­sis­tants and other an­cil­lary po­si­tions.</p>
    <p>Mid-ca­reer job seek­ers can tap the SGUnited Skills pro­gramme for skills train­ing in health­care po­si­tions, such as sup­port staff and ex­ec­u­tives in clin­i­cal and non-clin­i­cal roles.</p>
    <p>Skills train­ing lasts between six and 12 months for var­i­ous job roles, which in­clude health­care as­sis­tants, ther­apy as­sis­tants, com­mu­nity care co­or­di­na­tors, phar­macy tech­ni­cians, and health man­agers and ad­min­is­tra­tors.</p>
    <p>More than 1,300 train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties will be of­fered by seven train­ing part­ners, with classes start­ing pro­gres­sively from this month. The seven train­ing providers are the HMI In­sti­tute of Health Sci­ences, In­sti­tute of Tech­ni­cal Ed­u­ca­tion, NTUC Learn­ingHub, Repub­lic Polytech­nic, Sin­ga­pore Man­age­ment Univer­sity, Sin­ga­pore Univer­sity of So­cial Sci­ences and Te­masek Polytech­nic.</p>
