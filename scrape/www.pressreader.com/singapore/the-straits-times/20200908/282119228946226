    <p>The two-mem­ber board of Ax­ing­ton has ex­tended the of­fer pe­riod for a pro­posed rights is­sue as it awaits “fur­ther clar­ity” from the com­pany’s con­trol­ling share­hold­ers, who are also own­ers of the firm which made a bid for English Pre­mier League foot­ball club New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>The Catal­ist-listed com­pany had said last Thurs­day that it “in­tends for the rights is­sue to pro­ceed as per the timetable”, de­spite the ex­o­dus of five di­rec­tors.</p>
    <p>But in a fil­ing with the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change (SGX) late on Sun­day night, it an­nounced the ex­ten­sion fol­low­ing in­quiries from SGX and in or­der “to avoid lim­it­ing pos­si­bil­i­ties”. The board noted that Ax­ing­ton shares con­tinue to re­main vol­un­tar­ily sus­pended since Aug 31, pend­ing news of strate­gic changes to be made in the com­pany’s busi­ness di­rec­tion.</p>
    <p>As such, Ax­ing­ton in­tends to, among other things, recom­mence trad­ing of the nil-paid rights, which was due to end last Thurs­day, and ex­tend the Sept 9 clos­ing date for ac­cep­tance and pay­ment of all rights shares un­til the sus­pen­sion has been lifted and the shares re­sume trad­ing, the board said.</p>
    <p>The ex­ten­sion will pro­vide share­hold­ers with time to con­sider the ac­tion they should take and the op­por­tu­nity to trade in the nil-paid rights af­ter the stock re­sumes trad­ing and prior to mak­ing any ac­cep­tance and/or ap­pli­ca­tion for the rights shares and ex­cess rights shares, it added.</p>
    <p>Ax­ing­ton’s con­trol­ling share­hold­ers are cousins Nel­son Loh and Ter­ence Loh. They and busi­ness part­ner Evan­ge­line Shen are co­founders of the Sin­ga­pore-reg­is­tered Bel­la­graph Nova Group, which grabbed head­lines last month by mak­ing a bid for New­cas­tle United.</p>
    <p>But the com­pany be­came mired in con­tro­versy due to rev­e­la­tions rang­ing from doc­tored images of the co­founders with for­mer United States pres­i­dent Barack Obama to in­con­sis­ten­cies in claims.</p>
    <p>Ms Shen, a lawyer and jew­ellery mer­chant, re­signed last Wed­nes­day as Ax­ing­ton’s chair­man, along with three other di­rec­tors, a week af­ter for­mer US am­bas­sador to Sin­ga­pore Kirk Wa­gar quit the board.</p>
    <p>In July this year, Ax­ing­ton an­nounced a plan to change its core busi­ness from pro­fes­sional ad­vi­sory services to pro­vid­ing med­i­cal and con­sumer well­ness services, and in­vest­ments in ar­eas like ro­bot­ics and ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence tech­nol­ogy.</p>
    <p>On July 29, the firm pro­posed a non-un­der­writ­ten rights is­sue of up to 95.2 mil­lion new or­di­nary shares at 10 cents per share, on a one-fortwo ba­sis, to raise an es­ti­mated $9.4 mil­lion for busi­ness in­vest­ments and ac­qui­si­tions and gen­eral work­ing cap­i­tal.</p>
