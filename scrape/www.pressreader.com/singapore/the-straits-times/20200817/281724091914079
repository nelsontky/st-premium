    <p>MEL­BOURNE • New Zealand’s new Covid-19 out­break is growing, of­fi­cials said yes­ter­day, with the coun­try that had an early tri­umph over the pan­demic record­ing 13 new cases and putting next month’s gen­eral elec­tion in ques­tion.</p>
    <p>After sti­fling the virus ear­lier this year be­fore it be­came a pub­lic health cri­sis and 102 days without new in­fec­tions, an abrupt resur­gence last week i n Auck­land prompted an im­me­di­ate lock­down of the coun­try’s largest city.</p>
    <p>Yes­ter­day’s num­bers bring New Zealand’s to­tal ac­tive cases to 69, pro­vid­ing more am­mu­ni­tion to a con­ser­va­tive op­po­si­tion that wants to de­lay the Sept 19 elec­tion, which opin­ion polls show Prime Min­is­ter Jacinda Ardern’s Labour Party win­ning.</p>
    <p>Ms Ardern is ex­pected to re­sist a de­lay but has said she will de­cide by to­day. Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Win­ston Peters yes­ter­day also called for a de­lay, sug­gest­ing Oct 17 and Nov 21 as al­ter­na­tive dates.</p>
    <p>Health Min­is­ter John Hip­kins said the govern­ment was work­ing to en­sure ad­e­quate sup­plies of masks, which are cur­rently rec­om­mended but not manda­tory.</p>
    <p>In neigh­bour­ing Aus­tralia, which has also been strug­gling with a fresh out­break in two of its most pop­u­lous states, New South Wales and Vic­to­ria, there were signs of a fur­ther down­ward trend.</p>
    <p>New South Wales re­ported just five new cases yes­ter­day, while Vic­to­ria, where masks be­came com­pul­sory l ast month after the state be­came the cen­tre of the out­break, re­ported 279 new cases and 16 more deaths.</p>
    <p>On Satur­day, NSW had re­ported nine new in­fec­tions, while Vic­to­ria saw 303 new cases and four deaths.</p>
    <p>This past week’s daily num­ber of new cases has been well be­low the peak of 725 on Aug 5. Mel­bourne, the state’s cap­i­tal, re­mains un­der a strict lock­down.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing be­fore Vic­to­ria an­nounced its daily tally, Aus­tralia’s Health Min­is­ter Greg Hunt said the state still has a long way to go.</p>
    <p>“But the signs now are that the trend is of pro­gres­sive re­duc­tion,” Mr Hunt told Sky News tele­vi­sion.</p>
