    <p>Aus­tralian singer Kim­ber­ley Chen got quite a bit of at­ten­tion last year, but not for her mu­sic.</p>
    <p>The Tai­wan-based star had posted pho­tos of her­self in a bikini, walk­ing her dogs at what ap­peared to be a train sta­tion.</p>
    <p>Some ne­ti­zens crit­i­cised her at­tire as in­ap­pro­pri­ate, while oth­ers com­pli­mented her fig­ure.</p>
    <p>In an in­ter­view over Google Meet with Sin­ga­pore me­dia last Wednes­day to pro­mote her re­cent sin­gles, the singer re­sponded to re­ports on the in­ci­dent.</p>
    <p>The 26-year-old said: “I was tak­ing my dogs to go swim­ming, so I was wear­ing swimwear. Every­one wants to put the em­pha­sis on my body. I think it is dis­grace­ful... I was go­ing swim­ming – do you mean I can’t wear a bikini to go swim­ming?”</p>
    <p>Asked if the re­ports had changed her dog-walk­ing at­tire in any way, she replied: “Is there a prob­lem with the clothes I wear? Why should I pay at­ten­tion to what I wear?”</p>
    <p>No stranger to the lime­light, Chen started out as a child star at age six, singing and danc­ing on Aus­tralian na­tional tele­vi­sion.</p>
    <p>As a child, she also per­formed the role of young Nala in The Lion King stage mu­si­cal in Mel­bourne, and ap­peared as a child model for the Aus­tralian ver­sion of tele­vi­sion game show The Price Is Right.</p>
    <p>After mov­ing to Tai­wan, she com­peted in Tai­wanese singing com­pe­ti­tion One Mil­lion Star. In 2012, she re­leased her self-ti­tled de­but al­bum, with the ef­fer­ves­cent track Love You be­com­ing a run­away hit.</p>
    <p>With another two al­bums – Kim­bo­nomics (2013) and #Tag Me (2017) – un­der her belt, Chen joined record la­bel Chy­naHouse Dig­i­tal ear­lier this year, and has since re­leased the sin­gles 9 Mil­lion and 4am Calls. Th­ese deal with more ma­ture sub­jects than her pre­vi­ous work.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, the spunky R&B track 4am Calls is about stay­ing away from men who toy with women’s emo­tions.</p>
    <p>In the mu­sic video, Chen plays an em­ployee in a diner when one such man, played by her real-life boyfriend, Tai­wan-born singer Al­bert Lin, en­ters.</p>
    <p>Chen be­lieves every­one will see the hu­mour in cast­ing Lin in the role. After all, their re­la­tion­ship is</p>
    <p>“very good”, she said.</p>
    <p>How­ever, she has had ex­pe­ri­ences with “rub­bish men”.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, she once fan­cied a man who was not se­ri­ous about re­la­tion­ships. “I stopped lik­ing him be­cause I saw through him,” she re­vealed, adding that this ex­pe­ri­ence in­spired the song.</p>
    <p>In the groovy num­ber 9 Mil­lion, Chen sings about do­ing what she wants and hav­ing nine mil­lion dol­lars in her bank ac­count.</p>
    <p>When asked if this amount was in US dol­lars or New Tai­wan dol­lars, she laughed and replied good­na­turedly: “Both, both.” She said she used the fig­ure nine be­cause she felt it was a “nice” num­ber.</p>
    <p>Chen’s fu­ture plans in­clude re­leas­ing an al­bum around the end of the year. It will in­clude a va­ri­ety of mu­si­cal styles, such as bal­lads.</p>
    <p>Given her back­ground as a child star, who grew up in the public eye, might there be dif­fer­ent ex­pec­ta­tions of her, com­pared with other celebri­ties?</p>
    <p>“I do not really know what ex­pec­ta­tions au­di­ences have of me. I only know what ex­pec­ta­tions I have for my­self,” she replied.</p>
    <p>“I think the fans who really sup­port me – the very loyal fans – they will want me to be truly my­self and not pre­tend.”</p>
    <p>9 Mil­lion and 4am Calls are avail­able on on­line mu­sic plat­forms such as KKBox, Spo­tify and Ap­ple Mu­sic.</p>
    <p>Their mu­sic videos can be viewed at bit.ly/3jd­d3vq and bit.ly/2Ep­nAUN re­spec­tively.</p>
