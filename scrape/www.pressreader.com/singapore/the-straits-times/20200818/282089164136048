    <p>pre-Covid-19 lev­els any time be­fore 2024.</p>
    <p>In the mean­time, it projects global air­lines will col­lec­tively lose around US$84.3 bil­lion</p>
    <p>(S$115.5 bil­lion) this year and a fur­ther US$15.8 bil­lion next year.</p>
    <p>The SIA group – com­pris­ing SIA, SilkAir and Scoot – has around 220 planes, 3,273 pi­lots and 10,932 cabin crew.</p>
    <p>The to­tal num­ber of em­ploy­ees at the SIA group is about 28,000.</p>
    <p>Pre-pan­demic, SIA’s planes flew to 136 des­ti­na­tions. Dur­ing the height of the pan­demic in April, these planes flew to 15 des­ti­na­tions, largely to repa­tri­ate re­turn­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans.</p>
    <p>To­day, al­most 150 of its planes are parked at Changi Air­port and Alice Springs in Aus­tralia. Al­most 80 per cent of its pi­lots and cabin crew are grounded. The air­line now flies to just 39 des­ti­na­tions.</p>
    <p>By Oc­to­ber, even af­ter a slight re­cov­ery, it will op­er­ate at just 8 per cent of pas­sen­ger ca­pac­ity.</p>
    <p>The com­pany has man­aged to make it this far this year be­cause of the Gov­ern­ment’s gen­er­ous wage sup­port scheme and a mas­sive fund-raiser it car­ried out re­cently.</p>
    <p>The SIA group has raised</p>
    <p>$11 bil­lion via rights is­sues and se­cured loans.</p>
    <p>It has also tied up ad­di­tional credit lines, and can raise a fur­ther $6.2 bil­lion in manda­tory con­vert­ible bonds by July next year.</p>
    <p>This is the largest amount raised by any Asian car­rier group.</p>
    <p>This money serves two pur­poses. First, it pro­vides much-needed liq­uid­ity to get through the cash burn dur­ing a time when rev­enue has largely dried up.</p>
    <p>Sec­ond, it en­ables SIA to be in a strong enough po­si­tion to be among the lead­ers when the in­dus­try even­tu­ally re­cov­ers.</p>
    <p>Fail­ing on these two fronts means fail­ing its share­hold­ers who stumped up the money for its rights is­sue and its em­ploy­ees, who are sac­ri­fic­ing so much to help the com­pany get through this cri­sis.</p>
    <p>On the staff side, the com­pany has an­nounced sig­nif­i­cant wage cuts, of­fered no-pay leave, ar­ranged tem­po­rary re­de­ploy­ment to other in­dus­tries and rolled out early re­tire­ment for pi­lots and cabin crew.</p>
    <p>About 6,000 of its staff are still on no-pay leave, with 1,700 re­de­ployed in ex­ter­nal or­gan­i­sa­tions.</p>
    <p>So­bie Avi­a­tion an­a­lyst Bren­dan So­bie cal­cu­lates that the com­pany has ob­tained around $40 mil­lion a month from the Gov­ern­ment’s Jobs Sup­port Scheme. The Gov­ern­ment has just an­nounced an ex­ten­sion of a 50 per cent wage sup­port for the avi­a­tion sec­tor un­til end-March next year.</p>
    <p>But the bru­tal fact is, given the medium-term prog­no­sis for the in­dus­try, this may not be enough.</p>
    <p>Global avi­a­tion is un­likely to re­cover to pre­vi­ous lev­els for the next three years. Even if a vac­cine is found, it will take time to be de­ployed in many mar­kets.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, some travel habits may have changed, es­pe­cially on the cor­po­rate front where tech­nol­ogy has shown that a sig­nif­i­cant por­tion of busi­ness travel can be cut down.</p>
    <p>Yes, “travel bub­bles” and spe­cial</p>
    <p>“green lanes” will de­velop and grow. But will they grow fast enough to en­able SIA to sus­tain the scale of re­sources that it has in place right now? Not likely.</p>
    <p>The bottom line is that SIA will have to rescale too.</p>
    <p>Not scale down as a pre­mium car­rier but, rather,“right-size” for a mar­ket it will face for the next few years.</p>
    <p>As Mr So­bie points out, SIA will have to be much smaller than it is now, adding: “It will have to fly smaller air­craft, on a smaller net­work, with a smaller fleet.”</p>
    <p>In­deed, a sig­nif­i­cant num­ber of older and big­ger planes like the A-380 and B-777 will have to be moth­balled.</p>
    <p>The leased A-330s are al­ready re­turn­ing to Air­bus, while the older B777-200s are be­ing re­tired.</p>
    <p>Its fleet will have to com­prise the more ef­fi­cient and newer planes like the B-787 and A-350, while also tak­ing in the nar­row-body B-737s from SilkAir next year when the re­gional car­rier is merged into the par­ent air­line.</p>
    <p>As for staff, even af­ter all the mea­sures now in place, there will be sur­plus man­power if the mar­ket does not re­turn to pre-Covid-19 lev­els soon. And the mar­ket is un­likely to re­vert to pre-2020 lev­els any time soon.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, the Gov­ern­ment’s wage sup­port scheme will wind down this month.</p>
    <p>The Changi Air Hub em­ploys 190,000 peo­ple and ac­counts for 5 per cent of Sin­ga­pore’s gross do­mes­tic prod­uct. And SIA ac­counts for half of Changi’s traf­fic.</p>
    <p>Be­ing so crit­i­cal to Sin­ga­pore’s econ­omy, it is no sur­prise that the Gov­ern­ment has thrown so much sup­port be­hind both.</p>
    <p>Scal­ing down is a very dif­fi­cult propo­si­tion with grave con­se­quences for SIA if not done prop­erly.</p>
    <p>Cut back too much and the car­rier will be in dan­ger of los­ing its global pre­mium brand­ing. This is a mul­ti­ple-award-win­ning and world-beat­ing air­line known for its lat­est and most ef­fi­cient planes, won­der­fully ap­pointed cab­ins and the best pi­lots and crew in the world.</p>
    <p>Don’t do any­thing, and the group will be in dire fi­nan­cial straits by 2023.</p>
    <p>But SIA has to face stark new re­al­i­ties.</p>
    <p>A new re­al­ity where util­i­sa­tion of ca­pac­ity could re­main well un­der 50 per cent for the next three years.</p>
    <p>A new re­al­ity where costs will have to be man­aged against new mar­ket con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>A new re­al­ity where pre­mium travel – which ac­counts for 40 per cent of in­come – may not come back any time be­fore 2024 and, when it does, it might not be as big as it was be­fore.</p>
    <p>A new re­al­ity where air­lines have to de­fend their fi­nances just to sur­vive.</p>
    <p>A new re­al­ity where be­ing op­er­a­tionally nim­ble and flex­i­ble will sep­a­rate win­ners from losers. There is no play­book for this.</p>
    <p>This black swan event forces painful and un­prece­dented choices on the air­line in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>SIA’s day of reck­on­ing is draw­ing closer. Hard choices will have to be made, sooner rather than later.</p>
