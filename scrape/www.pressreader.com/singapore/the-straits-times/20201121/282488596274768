    <p>The Straits Times In­dex (STI) gained 36.01 points, or 1.3 per cent, to close at 2,813.01 yes­ter­day, on the back of a mod­est overnight re­bound by United States stocks that was led by tech stocks.</p>
    <p>On the lo­cal bourse, about 2.78 bil­lion shares worth $1.52 bil­lion changed hands, with gain­ers out­num­ber­ing losers 322 to 125.</p>
    <p>The in­dex’s largest gainer was Jardine Mathe­son, which added 4.8 per cent to US$53.68, fol­low­ing a se­ries of share buy­backs by the firm.</p>
    <p>Re­tailer group Dairy Farm In­ter­na­tional con­tin­ued its de­scent, fin­ish­ing 1.84 per cent lower at US$4.27.</p>
    <p>Oceanus was the most ac­tive counter of the day, trad­ing strong with a vol­ume of 642.7 mil­lion shares, as it added 22.22 per cent to close at $0.022. The stock has been ral­ly­ing since Nov 9, when the seafood and con­sumer goods firm posted its high­est rev­enue since FY2011 for the nine months ended Sept 30.</p>
    <p>Blu­mont also saw high trad­ing vol­ume, with 302.9 mil­lion shares chang­ing hands as its share price added 75 per cent to $0.007, af­ter an of­fer for the firm was made this week but at an ap­prox­i­mately 80 per cent dis­count.</p>
    <p>Over the week, the STI gained 3.75 per cent, with four days of gains and just one day of loss.</p>
    <p>Around the re­gion, mar­kets fin­ished mixed on the rel­a­tively data­l­ight trad­ing day. Shang­hai added 0.44 per cent, while the Hang Seng rose 0.36 per cent. Malaysia’s KLCI also added 0.64 per cent, but the Nikkei 225 shed 0.42 per cent.</p>
    <p>In­vestors are keep­ing an eye on Wash­ing­ton, where talks are due to re­sume on a new res­cue pack­age for the world’s top econ­omy.</p>
    <p>Oanda an­a­lyst Ed­ward Moya said: “A lot will need to go right, but the eco­nomic pain of many small busi­nesses... should keep Congress mo­ti­vated in get­ting a deal done.”</p>
    <p>Re­gional mar­kets end mixed on rel­a­tively data-light trad­ing day</p>
