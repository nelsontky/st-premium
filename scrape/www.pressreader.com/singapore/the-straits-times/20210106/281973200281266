    <p>In the thick of it, back in Moscow in 2003, it never seemed pos­si­ble that the on­slaught would go as far as it did. In the end, it took only months for Mr Mikhail Khodor­kovsky to find his oil em­pire un­der siege, and not much longer for the ed­i­fice to crum­ble.</p>
    <p>The par­al­lel be­tween the Yukos Oil de­ba­cle al­most two decades ago and the crack­down on Alibaba Group Hold­ing and af­fil­i­ate Ant Group over the past weeks will seem at best in­ex­act. And, to be clear, it is.</p>
    <p>Mr Jack Ma didn’t ben­e­fit from a chaotic and of­ten murky pri­vati­sa­tion process, nor has he been in­volved in the di­rect po­lit­i­cal machi­na­tions of the kind dab­bled in by Rus­sian oli­garchs in the 1990s.</p>
    <p>Ul­ti­mately, Mr Khodor­kovsky spent more than 10 years be­hind bars – though he has main­tained his in­no­cence – and the bulk of the com­pany he had turned around was taken over by state-owned Ros­neft. Blunt, dev­as­tat­ing blows.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, e-com­merce gi­ant Alibaba and the pay­ments com­pany it backs are fac­ing an­titrust scru­tiny and ques­tions over risks to fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity that many will ar­gue are long over­due, even if the method has been abrupt.</p>
    <p>Still, there are strik­ing sim­i­lar­i­ties. Here are two po­lit­i­cal sys­tems led by strong­men with a pen­chant for cut­ting hubris­tic en­trepreneur­s down to size with pre­ci­sion strikes – re­gard­less of the fi­nan­cial im­pact.</p>
    <p>Then, there’s the tim­ing. Mr Khodor­kovsky’s prob­lems be­gan af­ter he pub­licly chal­lenged Pres­i­dent Vladimir Putin on state cor­rup­tion, just as Mr Ma’s prob­lems sur­faced af­ter he was a lit­tle too can­did when dis­cussing China’s bank­ing sys­tem at a fi­nan­cial fo­rum, promptly de­rail­ing Ant’s record-break­ing ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing.</p>
    <p>Both fig­ures loom large in the econ­omy. And in both cases, there is a clear warn­ing for the wider busi­ness com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>Yukos marked a wa­ter­shed for Rus­sia. It was the end of the rel­a­tive lib­er­ties of the early 2000s and the start of a shift to­wards greater na­tional con­trol.</p>
    <p>The state, it was made clear to in­vestors, had clout and would use it. The en­tire episode fed an at­mos­phere of un­cer­tainty and fear which has pun­ished en­trepreneur­ship, in­no­va­tion and for­eign in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>It’s worth bear­ing that in mind when con­sid­er­ing what may be com­ing next in China, af­ter the past few weeks.</p>
    <p>That doesn’t mean fore­cast­ing Yukos-like an­ni­hi­la­tion. But it’s still an open question whether what fol­lows is sim­ply tighter reg­u­la­tion for Mr Ma’s realm and peer Ten­cent Hold­ings – which may well ben­e­fit the wider tech ecosys­tem in China – or a more dra­co­nian and dam­ag­ing, Rus­sia-style shift.</p>
    <p>There is clearly a need to re­dress the bal­ance in the Chi­nese tech uni­verse, and the tech com­pe­ti­tion de­bate is rag­ing well beyond China.</p>
    <p>Beijing’s reg­u­la­tors for years al­lowed in­no­va­tors like Ant to roam free, with oc­ca­sional raps on the knuckle – as, for ex­am­ple, with re­stric­tions im­posed af­ter a stu­dent died fol­low­ing an ex­per­i­men­tal can­cer treat­ment found among Baidu-pro­moted search re­sults or, more re­cently, by de­lay­ing video game ap­provals.</p>
    <p>Mr Ma ex­panded be­cause he was given space to. In this read­ing, and as Mr Martin Chorzempa of the Peter­son In­sti­tute for In­ter­na­tional Eco­nom­ics pointed out to me, the tim­ing of the crack­down may be partly ex­plained by the fact that the ex­tent of Ant’s breadth may not have been fully un­der­stood be­fore the de­tail in its IPO prospec­tus.</p>
    <p>There was then a need to step in quickly be­fore trade be­gan, to avoid hurt­ing mom-and-pop in­vestors. Mr Ma’s Shang­hai speech, which sug­gested pres­sure had been build­ing, made it po­lit­i­cally pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>It’s plau­si­ble, too, to ar­gue that a rel­a­tively young an­titrust sys­tem can over­com­pen­sate.</p>
    <p>In the past, the ty­coons who have come in for the dis­man­tling treat­ment in China have largely been pun­ished for dab­bling in debt-fu­elled sprees – like To­mor­row Hold­ing’s fi­nancier Xiao Jian­hua, seized from a lux­ury Hong Kong ho­tel de­spite his team of fe­male body­guards, or An­bang In­sur­ance Group’s Mr Wu Xiao­hui.</p>
    <p>That’s not true of Mr Ma, who has also been at pains to do his na­tional ser­vice.</p>
    <p>It’s worth go­ing back to Yukos. Then, too, there were le­git­i­mate ques­tions to be asked. Some high-pro­file in­vestors ac­tu­ally cheered the move at the time, says econ­o­mist Sergei Guriev at Sciences Po in Paris, who has writ­ten on the sig­nif­i­cance of the episode. But what fol­lowed was some­thing far more sweep­ing than an ef­fort to clean up af­ter the chaos of the 1990s.</p>
    <p>The state’s grip tight­ened. The very par­don­ing of Mr Khodor­kovsky in 2013, just be­fore the Sochi Olympics, was an ex­pres­sion of Mr Putin’s con­trol.</p>
    <p>The full im­pact of such light­ning bolts, a mark of pol­i­cy­mak­ing in coun­tries bal­anc­ing eco­nomic free­doms and po­lit­i­cal re­stric­tions, is al­ways hard to fore­cast.</p>
    <p>Al­low­ing more state-owned en­ti­ties to buy in, for ex­am­ple, may be a slip­pery slope. Cer­tainly, the rip­ple ef­fect from any fur­ther blows to Mr Ma and his em­pire would be sig­nif­i­cant, given his charis­matic im­age. He is far more pop­u­lar than Rus­sia’s widely dis­liked oli­garchs ever were.</p>
    <p>In the end, it may sim­ply be im­pos­si­ble to clip Mr Ma’s wings and pull back past free­doms with­out hurt­ing in­no­va­tion, as Rus­sia did.</p>
    <p>And then there’s the des­per­ate need for credit. Mr Ma’s sav­ing grace may be that he is not just a prob­lem, but part of the so­lu­tion.</p>
