    <p>An­other tech­ni­cian who boarded a ves­sel that car­ried 10 ear­lier im­ported coro­n­avirus cases was among the two new com­mu­nity cases re­ported yes­ter­day, said the Min­istry of Health (MOH).</p>
    <p>The 47-year-old Malaysian work per­mit holder boarded the ves­sel on Aug 9 to carry out es­sen­tial re­pair and main­te­nance work, a day after it ar­rived in Sin­ga­pore from In­dia for re­pair and re­fu­elling.</p>
    <p>After some of the ves­sel’s crew were con­firmed to have Covid-19, the tech­ni­cian was placed on quar­an­tine and swabbed for Covid-19 even though he was asymp­to­matic, the min­istry said.</p>
    <p>He was con­firmed to have the virus on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The man is the sec­ond tech­ni­cian con­nected to the ves­sel to have tested pos­i­tive for Covid-19.</p>
    <p>A Filipino tech­ni­cian who holds a work pass had boarded the same ves­sel be­tween Aug 8 and 12. He was one of the three new com­mu­nity cases re­ported on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The other new com­mu­nity case re­ported yes­ter­day was a 48year-old Sin­ga­porean man who was a con­tact of a pre­vi­ously con­firmed case.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, a Sin­ga­porean, a work pass holder, three de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers and a stu­dent’s pass holder made up the six new im­ported cases.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­porean, a 30-year-old man, had re­turned from In­done­sia on Aug 4. The work per­mit holder, a 31-year-old Filipino woman who is em­ployed in Sin­ga­pore, re­turned from the Philip­pines, also on Aug 4.</p>
    <p>The three de­pen­dant’s pass hold­ers are a five-year-old girl and a 27-year-old woman, both In­dian na­tion­als who ar­rived from In­dia on July 31, and a 34-year-old Filipino woman who ar­rived from the Philip­pines on Aug 4.</p>
    <p>The stu­dent’s pass holder is a 23-year-old Rus­sian man who ar­rived from Rus­sia on Aug 4.</p>
    <p>The MOH said all of them had been placed on 14-day stay-home no­tices upon ar­rival in Sin­ga­pore, and had been tested while serv­ing their no­tices at ded­i­cated fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>Mi­grant work­ers stay­ing in dor­mi­to­ries made up the re­main­ing 78 new coro­n­avirus pa­tients an­nounced yes­ter­day, tak­ing Sin­ga­pore’s to­tal to 55,747.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of new daily cases in the com­mu­nity has re­mained stable at an av­er­age of two cases per day in the past two weeks, said the MOH.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of un­linked cases in the com­mu­nity has also re­mained stable at an av­er­age of one case per day over the same pe­riod.</p>
    <p>With 432 cases dis­charged yes­ter­day, 51,938 pa­tients have fully re­cov­ered from the dis­ease.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore has had 27 deaths from Covid-19 com­pli­ca­tions, while 15 who tested pos­i­tive have died of other causes.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 82 pa­tients re­main in hos­pi­tal, while 3,685 are re­cu­per­at­ing in com­mu­nity fa­cil­i­ties. None is in in­ten­sive care.</p>
