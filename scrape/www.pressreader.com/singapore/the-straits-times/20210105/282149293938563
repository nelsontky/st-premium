    <p>Mea­sures to bet­ter counter money laun­der­ing and ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing were ap­proved yes­ter­day, un­der changes to the law that reg­u­lates vir­tual pay­ment ser­vice providers.</p>
    <p>These changes wi l l also strengthen laws gov­ern­ing dig­i­tal pay­ment to­kens (DPTs) to en­sure that com­pa­nies is­su­ing such to­kens pro­tect the as­sets of their users, said Trans­port Min­is­ter Ong Ye Kung, who is a Mon­e­tary Au­thor­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS) board mem­ber.</p>
    <p>Par­lia­ment passed the Pay­ment Ser­vices (Amend­ment) Bill yes­ter­day, fol­low­ing a roughly two-hour de­bate that saw 10 MPs tak­ing part.</p>
    <p>Un­der the changes, Sin­ga­pore will im­ple­ment en­hanced stan­dards for vir­tual as­set ser­vice providers who deal in DPTs, oth­er­wise known as cryp­tocur­ren­cies.</p>
    <p>Cryp­tocur­ren­cies have been gain­ing pop­u­lar­ity in­ter­na­tion­ally since the in­tro­duc­tion of the first one, bit­coin, in 2009. Over the past week­end, it was re­ported that bit­coin saw its price pass US$30,000 for the first time, based on data com­piled by Bloomberg news agency.</p>
    <p>Pre­vi­ously, MAS reg­u­lated cryp­tocur­rency ser­vice providers only when they pos­sessed money or the cryp­tocur­rency it­self – but this has now been ex­panded.</p>
    <p>Un­der the Bill, MAS has the power to reg­u­late ser­vice providers that fa­cil­i­tate the use of cryp­tocur­ren­cies for pay­ments, and who may not possess the money or cryp­tocur­ren­cies in­volved.</p>
    <p>This will cover three ac­tiv­i­ties: fa­cil­i­tat­ing the trans­mis­sion of cryp­tocur­ren­cies from one ac­count to an­other; cus­to­dial ser­vices for cryp­tocur­ren­cies; and fa­cil­i­tat­ing the ex­change of cryp­tocur­ren­cies where the ser­vice provider does not come into pos­ses­sion of the mon­eys or cryp­tocur­ren­cies in­volved.</p>
    <p>Al­though the use of cryp­tocur­rency has yet to fully take off in Sin­ga­pore, Mr Ong noted that the speed and cross-bor­der na­ture of cryp­tocur­rency ac­tiv­i­ties carry higher in­her­ent money laun­der­ing and ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing risks.</p>
    <p>They need to be reg­u­lated, and ser­vice providers must carry out proper cus­tomer due dili­gence and mon­i­tor­ing of trans­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>“Global stan­dards set­ting bod­ies, reg­u­la­tors and pol­i­cy­mak­ers around the world are fo­cused on ad­dress­ing these risks,” he said.</p>
    <p>“As a ma­jor fi­nan­cial cen­tre and fin­tech hub, Sin­ga­pore has played an ac­tive role in shap­ing in­ter­na­tional stan­dards, in­clud­ing at the Fi­nan­cial Ac­tion Task Force which sets stan­dards for com­bat­ing money laun­der­ing and ter­ror­ism fi­nanc­ing risks.”</p>
    <p>Mr Ong added that the Bill will broaden the def­i­ni­tion of cross­bor­der money trans­fer ser­vices to in­clude fa­cil­i­tat­ing trans­fers of money be­tween per­sons in dif­fer­ent ju­ris­dic­tions, where money is not ac­cepted or re­ceived by the ser­vice provider in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The changes to the law will al­low MAS to im­pose mea­sures on cryp­tocur­rency ser­vice providers to en­sure bet­ter con­sumer pro­tec­tion.</p>
    <p>Al­though the risks to con­sumers are not sig­nif­i­cant cur­rently due to the low us­age of cryp­tocur­rency here, Mr Ong pointed out that user adop­tion could gain trac­tion quickly as the in­dus­try comes out with prod­ucts to at­tract cus­tomers.</p>
    <p>He said that with the new laws, MAS could re­quire a cryp­tocur­rency ser­vice provider to seg­re­gate cus­tomer as­sets from its own as­sets, which will help safe­guard cus­tomer money from loss in the event of in­sol­vency.</p>
    <p>MAS will also be em­pow­ered to im­pose ad­di­tional mea­sures on cer­tain cryp­tocur­rency ser­vice providers to main­tain sta­bil­ity in Sin­ga­pore’s fi­nan­cial sys­tem, safe­guard the ef­fi­cacy of the mon­e­tary pol­icy, or where it is in the in­ter­est of the pub­lic to do so.</p>
    <p>Ac­knowl­edg­ing the broad scope of pow­ers that this gives MAS, Mr Ong said this was nec­es­sary so that the au­thor­ity can re­spond flex­i­bly and swiftly, given how fast-mov­ing the cryp­tocur­rency land­scape is.</p>
    <p>Some MPs like Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) and Ms Ng Ling Ling (Ang Mo Kio GRC) had asked if there would be en­hanced mea­sures to pre­vent peo­ple, in­clud­ing the el­derly, from be­ing mis­led by false mar­ket­ing to in­vest in cryp­tocur­ren­cies or from in­cur­ring large losses from in­vest­ing in them.</p>
    <p>Mr Ong said that MAS cur­rently re­quires li­censed cryp­tocur­rency ser­vice providers to clearly dis­close to their cus­tomers that they should in­vest in them only if they are fa­mil­iar with the prod­ucts, and are pre­pared to ac­cept the risk of los­ing all the money put into the ser­vice providers. “If DPT ser­vice providers make a state­ment that sug­gests that in­vest­ment in DPT is pro­tected un­der the Pay­ment Ser­vices Act, MAS will re­quire them to im­me­di­ately cor­rect or re­move the state­ment. And they will be sub­ject to en­force­ment ac­tions,” he said.</p>
    <p>Work­ers’ Party MPs Ja­mus Lim (Sengkang GRC) and Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC) had asked Mr Ong about the po­ten­tial detri­men­tal ef­fects from reg­u­lat­ing small play­ers in the cryp­tocur­rency space – to which the min­is­ter replied there was a need for bal­ance be­tween en­cour­ag­ing en­trepreneur­ship and pro­tect­ing con­sumers.</p>
    <p>“Com­pa­nies can come up with prod­ucts that are more at­trac­tive. And to­day, what we are do­ing, we believe, is an ap­pro­pri­ate and cal­i­brated re­sponse,” said Mr Ong.</p>
    <p>He added that the Govern­ment will con­tinue to ed­u­cate the pub­lic on cryp­tocur­ren­cies through the na­tional fi­nan­cial ed­u­ca­tion pro­gramme MoneySense.</p>
