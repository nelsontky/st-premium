    <p>A do­mes­tic helper, who was left to take care of an in­tel­lec­tu­ally dis­abled boy at home, ill-treated him by kick­ing him mul­ti­ple times.</p>
    <p>She was un­aware that the mother was record­ing the abuse through a closed-cir­cuit tele­vi­sion (CCTV) cam­era in­stalled in the home.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian maid, Yuni Suvi Yanti Sitepu, 38, was sen­tenced to six months’ jail in a district court yes­ter­day. She pleaded guilty to one count of ill-treat­ing the boy.</p>
    <p>Both the child and his mother can­not be named due to a gag or­der to pro­tect his iden­tity.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments stated that Yuni had been em­ployed as the fam­ily’s do­mes­tic helper for more than a month at the time of her of­fence. Her du­ties in­cluded tak­ing care of the boy, who is also suf­fer­ing from global devel­op­ment de­lay, epilepsy and hy­pothy­roidism.</p>
    <p>The court heard that at about 10am on May 16 last year, the mother used her mo­bile phone to view live footage from the CCTV cam­era in­stalled in the liv­ing room of her home.</p>
    <p>While view­ing the footage, she no­ticed Yuni was en­grossed in her mo­bile phone – singing and pos­ing in front of it – and was not pay­ing at­ten­tion to her son. The mother be­came sus­pi­cious when she saw the maid shov­ing the child aside, and de­cided to start record­ing.</p>
    <p>Sub­se­quent footage showed Yuni kick­ing the boy on mul­ti­ple oc­ca­sions, in­clud­ing once on the face, caus­ing him to fall back­wards. She also pushed the boy’s legs force­fully to­wards his face once, as he was ly­ing on his back.</p>
    <p>The mother stopped record­ing at about 11.45am after notic­ing that her hus­band had re­turned home from work. She made a po­lice re­port at 9.14pm.</p>
    <p>Court doc­u­ments stated that Yuni ad­mit­ted to kick­ing and push­ing the boy “in frus­tra­tion”.</p>
    <p>District Judge Ow Yong Tuck Leong back­dated her jail term to June 23, when she was re­manded.</p>
    <p>Yuni could have been jailed for up to four years and/or fined up to $4,000 for ill-treat­ing the boy.</p>
