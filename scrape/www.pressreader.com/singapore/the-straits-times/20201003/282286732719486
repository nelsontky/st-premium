    <p>We thank the var­i­ous writ­ers for their feed­back on the mat­ter of for­eign do­mes­tic work­ers (FDWs) be­ing al­lowed to work part-time.</p>
    <p>A for­eigner can work in Sin­ga­pore only if there is an em­ployer will­ing to un­der­take re­spon­si­bil­i­ties such as timely pay­ments of salary, preven­tion of work in­juries, pro­vi­sion of med­i­cal care and even­tual repa­tri­a­tion when the work pass is can­celled.</p>
    <p>We re­quire all work pass hold­ers, in­clud­ing FDWs, to work for only their des­ig­nated em­ploy­ers so that there is no dis­pute over who is re­spon­si­ble for the worker. This clar­ity is crit­i­cal to safe­guard the work­ers’ in­ter­ests and pre­vent prob­lems for the broader com­mu­nity.</p>
    <p>While we un­der­stand some work pass hold­ers may wish to earn more through ex­tra work, this can have un­in­tended con­se­quences for them and their em­ploy­ers. Work pass hold­ers, there­fore, can­not take on ad­di­tional jobs or en­gage in ac­tiv­i­ties to earn ad­di­tional in­come here. They should in­stead con­sider if the salary of­fered by their em­ployer is ac­cept­able be­fore tak­ing up the job in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In the case of FDWs, we are also con­cerned about the im­pact on their well-be­ing and abil­ity to per­form their du­ties. In­stead of work­ing as FDWs, those with ca­pac­ity to do more can con­sider work­ing for com­pa­nies that spe­cialise in house-clean­ing or care ser­vices, where they have po­ten­tial to earn over­time pay, sub­ject to statu­tory safe­guards be­ing met. Like­wise, em­ploy­ers should avail them­selves of such ser­vices if they pre­fer not to have a full-time FDW, in­stead of procur­ing ser­vices il­le­gally from other FDWs in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Man­power (MOM) takes a se­ri­ous view of il­le­gal em­ploy­ment. Be­tween 2017 and last year, MOM took more than 30 FDWs to task each year for work­ing il­le­gally. About half of these cases in­volved FDWs en­gag­ing in non-do­mes­tic work such as sell­ing items in pub­lic ar­eas or re­fer­ring other FDWs to take up loans from money­len­ders.</p>
    <p>MOM in­ves­ti­ga­tions also probe into whether any other par­ties, such as clean­ing agen­cies, fa­cil­i­tated the FDW’s il­le­gal em­ploy­ment. No ac­tion is taken against FDW em­ploy­ers if the in­ves­ti­ga­tion shows that they were not in­volved.</p>
