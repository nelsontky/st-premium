    <p>•</p>
    <p>New coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions in Tokyo hit a record high of more than 1,300 yes­ter­day, rais­ing fears of an ex­plo­sion in cases, lo­cal me­dia re­ported.</p>
    <p>New Year’s Eve cel­e­bra­tions were cur­tailed as the coun­try battles a third wave of the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Scores of flights were also can­celled as heavy snow­fall hit sev­eral ar­eas of Ja­pan yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Yoshi­hide Suga has urged peo­ple to cel­e­brate New Year qui­etly, and avoid non-es­sen­tial out­ings, amid the twin crises.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan Air­lines and All Nip­pon Air­ways can­celled or planned to can­cel some 140 flights, pub­lic broad­caster NHK re­ported, adding that a bul­let train had sus­pended ser­vices in some parts of the north­ern Ya­m­a­gata pre­fec­ture.</p>
    <p>A 70-year-old man died in the north­ern Iwate pre­fec­ture af­ter he re­port­edly fell into a river while try­ing to clear snow with a shovel loader ma­chine, NHK said.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan has been bat­tling a third wave of Covid-19 in­fec­tions in re­cent weeks.</p>
    <p>On Mon­day, the coun­try started bar­ring the en­try of non-res­i­dent for­eign na­tion­als af­ter de­tect­ing vari­ants of the virus from Bri­tain and South Africa.</p>
    <p>Ja­panese Econ­omy Min­is­ter Ya­su­toshi Nishimura said on Wed­nes­day that the gov­ern­ment may have to con­sider declar­ing a state of emer­gency if the num­ber of Covid-19 cases grows.</p>
    <p>Ja­pan’s Im­pe­rial House­hold Agency has can­celled an an­nual New Year’s event set for to­mor­row at which Emperor Naruhito and other im­pe­rial fam­ily mem­bers greet well-wish­ers.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple have been asked to stag­ger vis­its to shrines, tra­di­tion­ally pop­u­lar des­ti­na­tions over New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day.</p>
    <p>In Tokyo, where Gov­er­nor Yuriko Koike has warned of a po­ten­tial ex­plo­sion in Covid-19 cases amid record daily in­creases, ex­tra train ser­vices will be sus­pended un­til to­day.</p>
    <p>“I want to em­pha­sise again that there is no New Year hol­i­days for the coro­n­avirus. I urge peo­ple to spend quiet hol­i­days stay­ing at home with fam­i­lies,” Ms Koike told re­porters yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Suga was to meet min­is­ters, in­clud­ing Health Min­is­ter Nori­hisa Ta­mura and Econ­omy Min­is­ter Nishimura, later yes­ter­day, lo­cal me­dia said.</p>
    <p>About 3,400 peo­ple have died in Ja­pan from about 231,000 coro­n­avirus cases so far.</p>
