    <p>The US Cen­tres for Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion (CDC) said it was mon­i­tor­ing re­ports of al­ler­gic re­ac­tions to the Covid-19 vac­ci­na­tion and made rec­om­men­da­tions on how peo­ple with his­to­ries of al­ler­gies should pro­ceed.</p>
    <p>Any­one who has had a se­vere re­ac­tion to a Covid-19 vac­cine should not get the sec­ond dose, the agency said, defin­ing se­vere as need­ing the med­i­ca­tion ep­i­neph­rine or treat­ment in a hospi­tal.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple who have had a se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tion to any in­gre­di­ent in a Covid-19 vac­cine should avoid the vac­cine for­mu­la­tion con­tain­ing the in­gre­di­ent, CDC said.</p>
    <p>Those with his­to­ries of se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tion to vac­cines should con­sult their doc­tors about the Covid-19 shot.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple with se­vere al­ler­gies to food, pets, la­tex or en­vi­ron­men­tal con­di­tions and those with al­ler­gies to oral med­i­ca­tion or a fam­ily his­tory of se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions could still get vac­ci­nated, the CDC said on Satur­day.</p>
    <p>The US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion is in­ves­ti­gat­ing around five al­ler­gic re­ac­tions that hap­pened af­ter peo­ple were ad­min­is­tered Pfizer and BioNTech’s vac­cine in the United States last week.</p>
    <p>Last Fri­day, the FDA said the Moderna vac­cine should not be given to in­di­vid­u­als with a known his­tory of se­vere al­ler­gic re­ac­tions to any com­po­nents of the shot.</p>
    <p>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms must be</p>
    <p>“very trans­par­ent” about the risks and ben­e­fits of vac­cines, said the head of Asia’s largest drug­maker Takeda.</p>
    <p>Takeda, one of the world’s big­gest phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal firms, is not de­vel­op­ing its own vac­cine but has con­tracts with sev­eral firms to dis­trib­ute their jabs in Ja­pan and is also test­ing a virus treat­ment.</p>
    <p>“We have to man­age the sit­u­a­tion well, be very trans­par­ent and ex­tremely ed­uca­tive in the way we in­tro­duce prod­ucts,” said chief ex­ec­u­tive Christophe We­ber.</p>
    <p>“Medicines or vac­cines are never per­fect... there are al­ways some side ef­fects.”</p>
    <p>Mr We­ber sees a chance that the Covid-19 in­oc­u­la­tion could help push back the grow­ing tide of un­cer­tainty and out­right op­po­si­tion to vac­ci­na­tion world­wide.</p>
    <p>“Vac­cine hes­i­tancy is strong, es­pe­cially in some coun­tries, but many vac­cines are pro­tect­ing against dis­eases that peo­ple never see,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Here it’s dif­fer­ent, ev­ery­body is see­ing the im­pact of the coro­n­avirus... so it could ac­tu­ally re­demon­strate the value of vac­cines.”</p>
