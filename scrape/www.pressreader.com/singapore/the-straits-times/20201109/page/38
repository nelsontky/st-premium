        B18 | THE STRAITS TIMES MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2020 | | | OBITUARIES FOR BOOKINGS AND ENQUIRIES 1800-289-9988 6319-5192 or In Loving Memory Of Prof. "Paddy" Dennis Hugh Murphy Much loved father (to Ju and Nicco), grandfathe­r (to Tia), devoted Husband, friend and mentor to thousands. "Paddy" Murphy passed away peacefully at 2.15pm on 7 November 2020 Everyone who knew him would agree that he was man unlike any other; soft-spoken, brilliant, eccentric, witty, honourable and loyal. He was a gentleman, a polymath, a non-conformist and a teacher of immense stature. He taught his students more than ecology and entomology; he taught them wisdom. Paddy meant a great deal to many, and will be greatly missed. Paddy will always be remembered by generation­s of friends and students by his trademark safari suit, a cigarette clamped firmly in one hand and a butterfly net in the other - in an energetic pursuit of the secrets and wonders of nature that defies all convention. We know he is now in a celestial wilderness where he will be in his full elements: searching for insects to his heart’s content, satisfying his insatiable curiosity and enjoying a cold beer after a long day’s work. Paddy leaves behind: Son: Daughter-in-law: Daughter: Son-in-law: Granddaugh­ter:
Wife (deceased): Niccolai
