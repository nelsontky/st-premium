    <p>The fuel that pow­ers pas­sen­ger planes is nor­mally among the most ex­pen­sive oil prod­ucts, but in a sign of the times, the coro­n­avirus has turned it into a blend­ing com­po­nent for typ­i­cally cheaper ship­ping fuel.</p>
    <p>Straight-run kerosene, usu­ally pro­cessed into jet fuel, is now be­ing used to make very low-sul­fur fuel oil (VLSFO) for the mar­itime in­dus­try amid a plunge in con­sump­tion by air­lines. Higher than nor­mal amounts of diesel and vacuum gasoil are also find­ing their way into ship­ping fuel.</p>
    <p>The shift, al­most un­think­able just a year ago, re­flects the oblit­er­a­tion of de­mand the avi­a­tion in­dus­try has suf­fered in the wake of the Covid-19 pan­demic. And with the In­ter­na­tional Air Trans­port As­so­ci­a­tion not ex­pect­ing air travel to get back to pre-virus lev­els un­til 2024, it may be a fea­ture of the market for some time to come.</p>
    <p>Jet fuel com­po­nents were used for blend­ing in April and May in Sin­ga­pore be­fore it be­came un­eco­nomic as prices moved back to a pre­mium to VLSFO, said Mr Eu­gene Lin­dell, se­nior an­a­lyst at con­sul­tant JBC En­ergy GmbH. The switch­ing is pick­ing up again af­ter avi­a­tion fuel flipped back to a dis­count, he said.</p>
    <p>“Only in a sit­u­a­tion where the econ­omy is in com­plete tat­ters, do we see usu­ally more ex­pen­sive com­po­nents head­ing straight into VLSFO,” Mr Lin­dell said.</p>
    <p>Jet fuel prices in Sin­ga­pore plunged from above US$70 a bar­rel in Jan­uary to close to US$20 in early May be­fore re­cov­er­ing to trade around US$41, ac­cord­ing to Bloomberg Fair Value data. VLSFO bunker prices i n the Asian oil hub, mean­while, are now 54 per cent lower than they were at the end of last year.</p>
    <p>The de­struc­tion of de­mand for avi­a­tion and road trans­port fu­els has led to a greater avail­abil­ity of blend­ing com­po­nents for ship­ping fuel, Ms Unni Einemo, di­rec­tor of the In­ter­na­tional Bunker In­dus­try As­so­ci­a­tion, said at the Platts APPEC 2020 con­fer­ence last week.</p>
    <p>While jet fuel’s woes are re­sult­ing in cheaper prices for the ship­ping in­dus­try, blend­ing can po­ten­tially pose prob­lems. Trad­ing houses and re­fin­ers typ­i­cally buy a va­ri­ety of fuel oil and dis­til­lates to mix into fuel for ships. Us­ing too much straight-run kerosene, how­ever, can lower the tem­per­a­ture at which fu­els catch fire, a se­ri­ous risk for ves­sels.</p>
    <p>“As a very com­bustible petroleum prod­uct, j et fuel can be used in a ma­rine fuel blend, and so we would not be sur­prised this prac­tice may be oc­cur­ring,” Mr Tim Wil­son, prin­ci­pal spe­cial­ist for fu­els, lubes and emis­sions at Lloyd’s Reg­is­ter, told Bloomberg ear­lier this year. How­ever, jet fuel grades can have a far lower flash point, or tem­per­a­ture at which it ig­nites, than what’s re­quired for ship­ping fu­els, he said.</p>
