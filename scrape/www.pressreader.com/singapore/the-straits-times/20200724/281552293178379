    <p>The spirit of sol­i­dar­ity in Asean is in dan­ger of un­rav­el­ling as its mem­ber states seek self-de­feat­ing mea­sures to pro­tect their home mar­kets, says as­so­ciate editor Ravi Vel­loor (be­low).</p>
    <p>Just when you thought South-east Asia was on the thresh­old of a unique geoe­co­nomic op­por­tu­nity to soak up in­vest­ments leav­ing China and from oth­ers seek­ing neu­tral venues amid the strate­gic tus­sle be­tween Western na­tions and Bei­jing, it looks as though the eco­nomic crunch ac­cen­tu­ated by the pan­demic is spurring pro­tec­tion­ist in­stincts in­stead, to the re­gion’s detri­ment.</p>
    <p>To get a sense of this, look no fur­ther than the data on trade-re­lated non-tar­iff mea­sures (NTMs) put out by Cari, the CIMB Asean Re­search In­sti­tute.</p>
    <p>NTMs are pol­icy mea­sures other than Cus­toms tar­iffs. Ac­cord­ing to Cari, Asean mem­ber states have a com­bined 9,494 NTMs in place. That is way higher than their num­ber 20 years ago and about 4,000 more than the num­ber in 2015.</p>
    <p>Thai­land, the Philip­pines and In­done­sia have the most. In the decade to 2020, NTMs ac­tu­ally rose most in Viet­nam, one of the prin­ci­pal ben­e­fi­cia­ries of global in­vest­ments and trade ex­pan­sion.</p>
    <p>Now, not all NTMs are il­le­git­i­mate. But where they are in­tended to re­strict ac­cess to the do­mes­tic mar­ket, they are in­deed a cause for con­cern. In­deed, trade an­a­lysts say their num­ber has been ris­ing in the wake of the Covid-19 pan­demic as gov­ern­ments, es­pe­cially those with huge mar­kets, swivel to wall them off from out­side com­pe­ti­tion.</p>
    <p>It also is not a sur­prise that the coun­tries named above are the most pop­u­lated ones in the 10-mem­ber Asean group­ing and in a sense, jeal­ous of shar­ing the mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Flag­ging in­ter­est in re­gion­al­ism is cause for worry and when you see that hap­pen­ing in a coun­try like In­done­sia, the nat­u­ral leader of Asean and its big­gest econ­omy, it is par­tic­u­larly vex­ing.</p>
    <p>RE­MEM­BER THE ASEAN IN­DUS­TRIAL PROJECTS?</p>
    <p>Back in the 1980s and early 1990s, Jakarta used to be one of the strong­est ad­vo­cates for an Asean Free Trade Area and In­done­sia, the Philip­pines, Malaysia, Thai­land and Sin­ga­pore – the orig­i­nal five – had even talked of a se­ries of Asean In­dus­trial Projects (AIP), with each na­tion hav­ing at least one project in-coun­try.</p>
    <p>It was agreed then that once an Asean in­dus­trial project is al­lot­ted to a mem­ber na­tion, new na­tional projects of a sim­i­lar na­ture can be es­tab­lished only af­ter con­sul­ta­tion with fel­low mem­bers and on con­di­tion that the Asean project is not af­fected by the new projects pro­posed.</p>
    <p>To­day, one does not hear of the AIP. In­deed, some years ago, when heavy flood­ing in Thai­land af­fected pro­duc­tion in Ja­panese-owned car and an­cil­lary fac­to­ries, In­done­sia and the Philip­pines lob­bied to see if some of them would move over.</p>
    <p>To­day, far from wel­com­ing a re­gional grid, coun­tries such as In­done­sia even de­mand to see lo­cal­i­sa­tion plans from in­vestors, even if, for in­stance in phar­ma­ceu­ti­cals, the coun­try may not have the do­mes­tic tal­ent or re­sources to sus­tain the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>Like­wise, no Asean de­vel­op­ing coun­try has gained so much from ser­vices ex­ports as the Philip­pines, home to a boom­ing out­sourc­ing in­dus­try. Yet, ac­cord­ing to Cari, the most re­stric­tive coun­try for ser­vices to­day is the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>Mr Push­panathan Sun­dram, a for­mer Asean deputy sec­re­tary-gen­eral for the Asean Eco­nomic Com­mu­nity (AEC) and now head of an ad­vi­sory firm, says Asean is still strug­gling with its com­mit­ment to slash the time for sin­gle-win­dow clear­ance of goods from 10 to the promised three days.</p>
    <p>What’s more, he adds, Asean’s re­sponse to the pan­demic has been lack­ing in co­or­di­na­tion com­pared with, for in­stance, its per­for­mance dur­ing the fi­nan­cial crises when it came through with the Chi­ang Mai Ini­tia­tive and co­or­di­nated exit strate­gies.</p>
    <p>Be­yond, sig­nif­i­cant re­gional economies are weigh­ing the mer­its of free trade agree­ments (FTAs) they’ve signed. Last Novem­ber, In­dia, host to Asia’s No. 2 mar­ket by pop­u­la­tion, ex­ited ne­go­ti­a­tions for the Asean-led Re­gional Com­pre­hen­sive Eco­nomic Part­ner­ship (RCEP) trade agree­ment partly be­cause of the re­luc­tance of ne­go­ti­at­ing part­ners to free up ser­vices trade.</p>
    <p>This week, its for­eign min­is­ter said in a tele­vi­sion in­ter­view that FTAs, which pre­sum­ably in­clude those signed with Asean and Sin­ga­pore, had “not served the econ­omy in terms of build­ing our ca­pac­i­ties”. Sin­ga­pore is In­dia’s No. 1 trad­ing part­ner within the Asean cir­cle.</p>
    <p>It doesn’t help that the eco­nomic cri­sis is show­ing few signs of a let-up, spurring wor­ri­some so­cial trends, in­clud­ing xeno­pho­bia. In­deed, things may get worse; Moody’s this week said in its quar­terly In­side Asean re­port that the re­gion, while bet­ter off than many other re­gions, needs to brace it­self for sharp falls in ex­ter­nal trade flows, slug­gish com­mod­ity prices that weigh on the fis­cal rev­enues of com­mod­ity ex­porters, and fi­nan­cial mar­ket volatil­ity that can trig­ger cap­i­tal out­flows.</p>
    <p>Against that back­ground, it is un­sur­pris­ing that the first in­stinct of gov­ern­ments is to think of their own peo­ple first and, in the process, they are led to think that walling off the world is the so­lu­tion.</p>
    <p>While un­der­stand­able, this is a pity still. Asean has much to gain by pre­sent­ing it­self to the world as a broadly uni­fied US$3.3 tril­lion (S$4.6 tril­lion) econ­omy at a time when China and In­dia are strug­gling with their own is­sues and po­ten­tially face un­fa­mil­iar eco­nomic shrink­age.</p>
    <p>DAN­GER SIG­NALS FROM CHINA’S ECON­OMY</p>
    <p>China, whose econ­omy has been slow­ing in the past two years, is caught in a geopo­lit­i­cal con­test with the United States, its strate­gic space sought to be cor­ralled by a length­en­ing list of na­tions alarmed at its in­creas­ingly un­apolo­getic reach for global in­flu­ence, not to speak of ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>The gi­ant main­land econ­omy re­turned to growth in the sec­ond quar­ter af­ter a near 7 per cent con­trac­tion in the first quar­ter, and Amro, the re­gional sur­veil­lance unit set up un­der the Chi­ang Mai Ini­tia­tive, fore­casts it to eke out growth of 2.3 per cent this year.</p>
    <p>Nev­er­the­less, Asia’s big­gest econ­omy is ra­di­at­ing dan­ger sig­nals. Re­tail sales are shrink­ing and much of the in­vest­ment go­ing into the econ­omy is not from pri­vate com­pa­nies, which have scaled back, but state-owned com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>Mean­while, bub­bles are build­ing. Three months ago, this col­umn took note of bulging house­hold debt in China. Now, some an­a­lysts are pre­dict­ing a “Lehman mo­ment” for the econ­omy as an as­set bulge big­ger than that seen dur­ing the US hous­ing cri­sis in the 2000s takes shape.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, in the year ended in June, about US$1.4 tril­lion was re­port­edly in­vested in Chi­nese hous­ing, com­pared with about US$900 bil­lion a year that was be­ing in­vested in res­i­den­tial real es­tate at the peak of the US prop­erty boom. Since the bulk of real es­tate lend­ing is go­ing to those who own at least one prop­erty, the ev­i­dence sug­gests this is a spec­u­la­tive mar­ket where in­vestors are bet­ting that the state will not al­low it to fail.</p>
    <p>One an­a­lyst cites Lip­per An­a­lyt­ics, say­ing that the num­ber of empty apart­ments, es­ti­mated at 65 mil­lion at the end of last year, would have climbed sig­nif­i­cantly, were it not for the fact that com­ple­tion cer­tifi­cates for many were de­lib­er­ately de­layed so as not to bulk up the sta­tis­tics fur­ther.</p>
    <p>COVID-19 STRUG­GLES IN IN­DIA</p>
    <p>Mean­while, In­dia’s Covid-19 in­fec­tion rate has steep­ened, show­ing up gov­ern­ment in­ept­ness. Its Asean-sized econ­omy is per­ilously im­paired by fall­ing con­sump­tion and bad loans stack­ing up on the books of banks. De­spite the prom­ise of a good mon­soon this year, which helps farm in­comes and fu­els de­mand for con­sumer goods, mat­ters are dire.</p>
    <p>DBS Bank an­a­lysts say that about 7 per cent of the pan­demic-af­fected dis­tricts ac­count for 70 per cent of the to­tal in­fec­tion tally and they are in eco­nom­i­cally key states such as Ma­ha­rash­tra (14 per cent of na­tional out­put), Tamil Nadu (8.5 per cent) and Gu­jarat (8 per cent), all key trad­ing nodes as well.</p>
    <p>“If more states go down this path,” DBS econ­o­mist Rad­hika Rao said this week in a note to clients, it “might pose re­newed sup­ply chain dis­rup­tions as well as un­cer­tainty for man­u­fac­tur­ers, in­clud­ing au­tomak­ers, OEMs (orig­i­nal equip­ment man­u­fac­tur­ers), elec­tron­ics etc.”</p>
    <p>In­vestors will not miss what’s tak­ing shape in both huge na­tions, with the at­ten­dant eco­nomic and po­lit­i­cal risks.</p>
    <p>A sta­ble Asean tied to both the West and China, in­clined to stitch economies to­gether with har­monised stan­dards that al­low goods to flow with rel­a­tive seam­less­ness be­tween them, would be a ma­jor in­vest­ment al­lure. Yet, aside from Viet­nam and, in a more lim­ited way, Malaysia and Thai­land, the rest of Asean has missed this op­por­tu­nity. Even far­away Poland and Mexico have prof­ited from these flows more than, say In­done­sia or the Philip­pines.</p>
    <p>FLAG­GING IN­TRA-ASEAN TRADE</p>
    <p>In­vest­ments aside, greater in­tra-Asean trade would have been a use­ful dyke against the va­garies of global trade. Cur­rently, in­tra-Asean trade is short of a quar­ter of Asean’s over­all trade fig­ures and the tar­get is to dou­ble that by 2025. That am­bi­tion looks out of reach and even the cur­rent num­bers could be at risk.</p>
    <p>What’s more, says Dr Deb­o­rah Elms of the Asian Trade Cen­tre in Sin­ga­pore, even as dig­i­tal trade ex­pands, many gov­ern­ments are seek­ing to place re­stric­tions; Viet­nam, where many of­fi­cials have never bought a sin­gle prod­uct on­line, has been in­creas­ingly us­ing its cy­ber-se­cu­rity laws to crimp on­line trade in goods and ser­vices. In­done­sia is un­der in­ves­ti­ga­tion by the US au­thor­i­ties un­der Sec­tion 301, which re­lates to un­fair trade prac­tices.</p>
    <p>The RCEP deal, which many expect will be ready for sign­ing in Novem­ber, does help, but given that it is ne­go­ti­ated across 15 economies, it has to be lim­ited in am­bi­tion.</p>
    <p>The real deal has to be a strong AEC, and Dr Elms says trade ne­go­tia­tors should quickly fo­cus on strength­en­ing the AEC, par­tic­u­larly its ser­vices trade, once the RCEP is out of the way.</p>
    <p>While the RCEP does touch on ser­vices trade, the com­mit­ments are rel­a­tively light, she notes. The AEC, which in­cludes only Asean states, should be able to pur­sue a more mean­ing­ful agenda.</p>
    <p>Mr Ce­sar Purisima, the for­mer fi­nance sec­re­tary of the Philip­pines, put it ac­cu­rately last week when he said Asean was fac­ing an un­prece­dented “ex­is­ten­tial stress test”, with the ground shift­ing much faster than its lead­ers can cope with and its weak cen­tre lim­it­ing its abil­ity to tackle the mul­ti­ple chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Trade, he pointed out, has long been the re­gion’s premise for pros­per­ity and its for­tunes rode on the suc­cess of global eco­nomic in­te­gra­tion. That glob­al­i­sa­tion is now on pause can­not be good news for South-east Asians. That it could be un­wound would be even more dis­as­trous.</p>
