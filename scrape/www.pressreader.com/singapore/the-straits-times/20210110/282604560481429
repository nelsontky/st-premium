    <p>Com­pet­i­tive sport is of­ten a num­bers game – ath­letes aim to beat records and per­sonal bests by a frac­tion of a sec­ond, a mil­lime­tre; teams fight for points; coun­tries want to win as many medals as they can at a ma­jor Games.</p>
    <p>It is also about con­sis­tency – they want be at their best for as long as pos­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Yet, for all the joy that the South­east Asian Games bring to the re­gion once ev­ery two years, con­sis­tency with the num­ber of sports in­volved is sorely lack­ing.</p>
    <p>In their last 10 editions from 2001 to 2019, the num­ber of sports has fluc­tu­ated as such: 32-32-40-43-25-44-34-36-38-56. This year’s SEA Games in Hanoi, Vietnam will have 40 sports.</p>
    <p>If South-east Asia is to take sports de­vel­op­ment se­ri­ously and wants its show­piece event to be treated as such, it has to agree to end the whim­si­cal na­ture in which sports and events are added and dropped, and im­pose a stricter struc­ture for the SEA Games pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>While the num­bers may ap­pear ar­bi­trary to a lay­man, the lack of con­sis­tency could mean a floor­ball team win­ning a his­toric gold in one edi­tion of the Games, but find­ing them­selves un­able to de­fend it in the next one when the sport is dropped.</p>
    <p>The Hanoi SEA Games al­ready have a num­ber of eye-catch­ing in­clu­sions and omis­sions.</p>
    <p>For in­stance, fin swim­ming has made the cut while wa­ter polo, a com­pul­sory dis­ci­pline of aquat­ics which has been at the Games since 1965, has been dropped.</p>
    <p>Another Olympic sport left out is sail­ing, for rea­sons such as costs and lack of fa­cil­i­ties, which are odd con­sid­er­ing there are tech­ni­cal and equip­ment sup­port</p>
    <p>from other coun­tries and Ha­long Bay is less than a three-hour drive from the cap­i­tal.</p>
    <p>The more likely ex­pla­na­tion is Vietnam not hav­ing strong tra­di­tions in wa­ter polo and sail­ing – it did not field any ath­letes in th­ese sports in re­cent editions of the Games.</p>
    <p>Which brings us to the long­stand­ing crit­i­cism of the bi­en­nial meet as a “kam­pung Games” where shut­tle­cock kick­ing can feature along­side bad­minton and hosts end up with a glut of gold medals.</p>
    <p>The trend ap­pears to have be­gun in 1987 when In­done­sia bumped up the num­ber of sports from 18 in Bangkok 1985 to 29 and won a whop­ping 183 gold medals.</p>
    <p>There were 12 to 18 sports in the first 13 Games, and no coun­try had crossed the 100-gold mark be­fore that.</p>
    <p>Un­usual sports have ap­peared on the ros­ter since, such as</p>
    <p>paraglid­ing (In­done­sia won 11 out of 13 golds in 2011), chin­lone (Myan­mar won six out of eight golds in 2013), and ar­nis (the Philip­pines won 14 out of 20 golds in 2019).</p>
    <p>This propen­sity for Games hosts to in­clude sports they are strong in and that have a strong lo­cal fol­low­ing is not solely a SEA Games habit, as the Asian Games have fea­tured kabaddi while the 2020 Tokyo Olympics or­gan­is­ers lob­bied for the de­but of karate.</p>
    <p>While it is not wrong to add lo­cal flavour to a Games, in­clud­ing un­con­ven­tional events by bulk to skew the medal tally can be seen as un­sport­ing be­hav­iour.</p>
    <p>Con­sid­er­ing how Tokyo and Paris 2024 have 33 and 32 sports re­spec­tively, a max­i­mum of 40 sports seems like a sweet spot for the SEA Games.</p>
    <p>At the mo­ment, the SEA Games Fed­er­a­tion has its char­ter and rules which clas­sify the sports in three cat­e­gories – com­pul­sory sports, Olympic and Asian Games sports, and other sports.</p>
    <p>In 2019, the Philip­pines added 11 sports from the third cat­e­gory which con­trib­uted 34 golds to their haul.</p>
    <p>Other than ar­nis, they pock­eted all six ob­sta­cle rac­ing golds and five out of 11 in jiu-jitsu as both sports made their SEA Games de­buts.</p>
    <p>The hosts even­tu­ally topped the over­all stand­ings among 11 na­tions with 149 golds, a rare oc­cur­rence con­sid­er­ing they never fin­ished higher than fifth in the six pre­vi­ous editions.</p>
    <p>To in­crease the cred­i­bil­ity and sta­bil­ity of the meet, the SEA Games Fed­er­a­tion could fur­ther limit the cap of Cat­e­gory Three sports from a max­i­mum of 12 to five.</p>
    <p>Ad­di­tion­ally, it can also in­crease the min­i­mum quota of par­tic­i­pat­ing na­tions per sport from four to five, or even six, for a sport to be in­cluded in the pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>Not only would this in­crease com­pet­i­tive­ness, but it also gives lo­cal as­so­ci­a­tions the mo­ti­va­tion to help es­tab­lish and raise aware­ness and ca­pa­bil­i­ties for their sport in neigh­bour­ing coun­tries – like what the Singapore Floor­ball As­so­ci­a­tion and Net­ball Singapore have been try­ing to do in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>This must be a more sin­cere way of forg­ing re­gional unity than hand­ing out a bag of gold medals to dif­fer­ent hosts ev­ery two years.</p>
    <p>Since the first South-east Asian Penin­su­lar Games in Thai­land in 1959, this event has been a plat­form for the re­gion to blood young tal­ents for Olympic suc­cess, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­porean swim­mer Joseph School­ing, Malaysian diver Pan­delela Ri­nong, Viet­namese shooter Hoang Xuan Vinh and Philip­pine weightlift­er Hidi­lyn Diaz.</p>
    <p>Surely, it is time for the Games to move out of the “kam­pung” into a more ma­ture and mod­ern era.</p>
    <p>And that jour­ney should kick off with its sports pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>While it is not wrong to add lo­cal flavour to a Games, in­clud­ing un­con­ven­tional events by bulk to skew the medal tally can be seen as un­sport­ing be­hav­iour.</p>
