    <p>Sin­ga­pore­ans will be given $320 mil­lion in “tourism cred­its” to spend do­mes­ti­cally as part of a cam­paign to prop up lo­cal busi­nesses, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat an­nounced yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The cred­its will be called Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers, named for the $45 mil­lion cam­paign launched last month to drive lo­cal spend­ing to Sin­ga­pore’s eateries, shops, ho­tels and leisure at­trac­tions.</p>
    <p>This spend­ing ini­tia­tive and a seven-month ex­ten­sion to wage sub­si­dies for lo­cal work­ers are the key thrusts of ad­di­tional sup­port for the bat­tered tourism sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng, who is also Finance Min­is­ter, noted in his min­is­te­rial state­ment that for­eign vis­i­tor ar­rivals have dried up due to travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>“Lo­cal con­sump­tion will not fully make up for tourist spend­ing, but I hope Sin­ga­pore­ans will take the op­por­tu­nity to ex­plore our lo­cal cul­ture and her­itage, na­ture, art and ar­chi­tec­ture,” he said, adding that more details on the vouch­ers will be re­leased next month.</p>
    <p>The Jobs Sup­port Scheme, which pays part of the wages for lo­cal work­ers, will be set at 50 per cent sup­port for the hard­est-hit aero­space, avi­a­tion and tourism sec­tors for the next seven months.</p>
    <p>More tar­geted help may also be on the way for busi­nesses in the arts and cul­ture and sports sec­tors, which will also take much longer to re­sume full ac­tiv­i­ties, Mr Heng said.</p>
    <p>“These are im­por­tant sec­tors that strengthen our so­cial fab­ric and di­ver­sity,” he said.</p>
    <p>Things are look­ing less rosy for the nightlife sec­tor, how­ever.</p>
    <p>Mr Heng noted that a small num­ber of busi­nesses, such as those in the nightlife in­dus­try, may not be able to open any time soon, due to safe man­age­ment con­sid­er­a­tions.</p>
    <p>“For these busi­nesses, the Govern­ment will help them tran­si­tion to other ac­tiv­i­ties or ease their exit,” he said.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of Trade and In­dus­try said more details on this will be pro­vided shortly.</p>
    <p>The Straits Times re­ported last week that the Sin­ga­pore Nightlife Busi­ness As­so­ci­a­tion (SNBA) had ap­pealed to the Govern­ment to ei­ther al­low all nightlife op­er­a­tors to re­open, or help them to pivot, hi­ber­nate or liq­ui­date.</p>
    <p>About a third of the as­so­ci­a­tion’s 320 mem­bers remain shut as they do not have li­cences that al­low them to op­er­ate as food and bev­er­age es­tab­lish­ments.</p>
    <p>SNBA pres­i­dent Joseph Ong told The Straits Times that the ex­ten­sion of wage sub­si­dies came as a re­lief, though the in­dus­try is await­ing details on other av­enues of sup­port.</p>
    <p>“The way that DPM put it was ex­actly what we were propos­ing: Help us pivot or exit.”</p>
    <p>He hopes that SNBA’s sug­ges­tion for busi­ness con­sul­tants to help firms de­ter­mine their next steps will be taken on board.</p>
    <p>“Some may think clos­ing may be a good thing, but maybe there’s a chance to pivot. And for some who want to pivot, it might be best to close,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ms Francesca Way, co-founder of en­ter­tain­ment and nightlife firm A Phat Cat Col­lec­tive, said Mr Heng’s speech pro­vided a clearer time­line for the in­dus­try.</p>
    <p>“At least they’re up­front about our op­tions, which gives us more clar­ity on how to pro­ceed,” she said.</p>
    <p>The col­lec­tive is look­ing into li­cens­ing re­quire­ments and busi­ness tweaks that would al­low its ar­cade­themed bar and night­clubs Nine­teen80 and Pin­ball Wizard to re­open.</p>
    <p>It will also have to change plans for an up­com­ing venue that was con­cep­tu­alised as a house mu­s­ic­cen­tred night­club.</p>
    <p>“Given the cur­rent re­al­ity, we will prob­a­bly have to re­view how we can go into more of a din­ing con­cept,” said Ms Way.</p>
    <p>Ex­pe­dited ap­proval for busi­nesses ap­ply­ing for change of use and more clar­ity on the tech­ni­cal­i­ties of li­cens­ing and other re­quire­ments would be help­ful, she added.</p>
    <p>Dr Kevin Cheong, chair­man of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Sin­ga­pore At­trac­tions, said the ad­di­tional sup­port an­nounced for the tourism in­dus­try was bet­ter than he had ex­pected.</p>
    <p>The Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers will act as an in­di­rect form of dis­count­ing for busi­nesses, he noted, as some had said slash­ing prices would be dif­fi­cult with ca­pac­ity lim­its in place.</p>
    <p>Like other life­style op­er­a­tors, he ex­pressed hope that the cred­its would be spread out to help smaller busi­nesses across sec­tors, rather than hav­ing the bulk be­ing used to off­set staycation pack­ages.</p>
    <p>But how con­sumers choose to use their cred­its will also be a good in­di­ca­tor of which busi­nesses are here to stay, Dr Cheong said.</p>
    <p>“Mar­ket forces will save the ones in de­mand.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore Tourism Board chief ex­ec­u­tive Keith Tan said tourism busi­nesses have been in­tro­duc­ing safe and at­trac­tive ex­pe­ri­ences and pro­mo­tions as part of the drive to boost do­mes­tic spend­ing.</p>
    <p>“Through the Sin­gapoRedis­cov­ers vouch­ers, we hope to rally Sin­ga­pore­ans to en­joy and ap­pre­ci­ate what we have in Sin­ga­pore, while sup­port­ing our tourism sec­tor dur­ing this chal­leng­ing time,” he said.</p>
