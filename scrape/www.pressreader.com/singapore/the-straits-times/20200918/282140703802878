    <p>Global de­mand for safety items amid the pan­demic sent prof­its rock­et­ing by 1,646 per cent at Top Glove, which said yes­ter­day that its “best days are still ahead of us”.</p>
    <p>The Malaysian firm, which is dual-listed in Kuala Lumpur and Sin­ga­pore, posted record earn­ings of RM1.29 bil­lion (S$422 mil­lion) for the fourth quar­ter ended Aug 31.</p>
    <p>This was well above the RM74.2 mil­lion recorded a year ago and beat the me­dian an­a­lyst fore­cast of</p>
    <p>RM349.2 mil­lion in a Refini­tiv poll.</p>
    <p>Ex­ec­u­tive chair­man Lim Wee Chai yes­ter­day said the firm was in talks with bankers about a plan to list in Hong Kong within six to nine months, re­ported Reuters.</p>
    <p>“It’s only a plan and we are talk­ing to... see which is the most suit­able method to go for list­ing in Hong Kong,” he said in a vir­tual brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Fourth-quar­ter rev­enue jumped 161 per cent year on year to RM3.11 bil­lion. Earn­ings per share for the quar­ter rose from 0.95 sen a year ago to 15.82 sen.</p>
    <p>Full-year earn­ings shot up to</p>
    <p>RM1.87 bil­lion from RM364.7 mil­lion, while rev­enue rose 51 per cent over last year to RM7.24 bil­lion.</p>
    <p>The board has rec­om­mended a fi­nal dividend of 8.5 sen a share. This makes for a full-year pay­out of 11.8 sen per share – up 373 per cent from the pre­vi­ous year.</p>
    <p>The to­tal pay­out of about RM961.2 mil­lion trans­lates to a net profit pay­out ra­tio of 51 per cent.</p>
    <p>Top Glove said strong global de­mand al­lowed it to raise av­er­age sell­ing prices. Earn­ings were lifted by pro­duc­tiv­ity en­hance­ments, like util­i­sa­tion lev­els of close to 100 per cent, which boosted ef­fi­ciency and reaped economies of scale.</p>
    <p>High util­i­sa­tion also helped lower over­heads sig­nif­i­cantly, no­tably the cost of labour and nat­u­ral gas.</p>
    <p>The firm said its gloves would still be re­quired even when a virus vac­cine is avail­able. It es­ti­mates de­mand to grow 25 per cent next year and 15 per cent post-pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Mr Lim said: “Our un­prece­dented per­for­mance un­der­lines the ef­fec­tive­ness of our im­prove­ment ini­tia­tives, which fo­cus on qual­ity and cost ef­fi­ciency, and which have en­abled us to meet the in­crease in de­mand. With glove de­mand still on the up­trend, we be­lieve our best days are still ahead of us.”</p>
    <p>It has ear­marked RM8 bil­lion for cap­i­tal ex­pen­di­ture over the next six years. This will give it ad­di­tional ca­pac­ity of 100 bil­lion gloves. The funds will be for new ca­pac­ity and en­hanc­ing ex­ist­ing man­u­fac­tur­ing fa­cil­i­ties, among oth­ers.</p>
    <p>Top Glove also said it is in talks with United States Cus­toms Bor­der and Pro­tec­tion in try­ing to get a with­hold re­lease or­der lifted.</p>
    <p>The agency in July placed a de­ten­tion or­der on im­ports from two of</p>
    <p>Top Glove’s sub­sidiaries. Such ac­tion is nor­mally taken against firms sus­pected of us­ing forced labour.</p>
    <p>Top Glove said it had a to­tal of 4,000 lo­cal em­ploy­ees over the past year to meet grow­ing de­mand.</p>
    <p>It is the sec­ond-largest firm on Bursa Malaysia and the ninth­largest on the Sin­ga­pore Ex­change, with a mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion of RM68.6 bil­lion and $22.6 bil­lion as of Tues­day. Its stock closed down 12 per cent at $2.63 yes­ter­day. It is up about 69 per cent for the year.</p>
