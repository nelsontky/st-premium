        <p>Last week’s re­lease of Mus­lim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir from an In­done­sian prison while the Arab world cel­e­brated the peace deal that lifted the Saudi Ara­bia-led block­ade on Qatar serves to re­mind us of the link­ages that con­nect us to the western part of Asia, oth­er­wise known as the Mid­dle East.</p>
        <p>Bashir, 82, is of Ye­meni de­scent, and he func­tioned as spir­i­tual leader of the Je­maah Is­lamiah (JI) net­work that or­ches­trated the Bali bomb­ings of 2002 that killed more than 200 peo­ple, in­clud­ing 88 Aus­tralians.</p>
        <p>JI, which took eight years of sus­tained counter-ter­ror­ism ef­forts be­fore it was con­sid­ered to be quelled to a sat­is­fac­tory de­gree in South-east Asia, was it­self in­spired by Al-Qaeda, whose rise is linked to the blood-soaked siege of Mecca’s Grand Mosque in Novem­ber 1979. Given the var­i­ous na­tion­al­i­ties that par­tic­i­pated in that siege, it is con­sid­ered to be the first op­er­a­tion by the phe­nom­e­non we have come to know as global ji­had.</p>
        <p>The siege of Mecca was led by a fire­brand Saudi who preached that the Saudi royal fam­ily had be­come a will­ing tool of Amer­ica, and sought a re­turn to the glory of pu­ri­tan­i­cal Is­lam. Al­though most par­tic­i­pants in the coup were swiftly put to death, the Saudi roy­als’ en­su­ing com­pro­mise with the Wah­habi cler­ics in or­der to main­tain their own le­git­i­macy and rule would have reper­cus­sions around the globe.</p>
        <p>Like it or not, what hap­pens in West Asia does not stay in West Asia. This is why last week’s peace deal an­nounced on the side­lines of the Gulf Co­op­er­a­tion Coun­cil (GCC) meet­ing in Saudi Ara­bia has salience for the rest of Asia.</p>
        <p>Qataris are cheer­ing the restora­tion of ties with Saudi Ara­bia, the United Arab Emi­rates, Bahrain and Egypt af­ter the block­ade im­posed in 2017 by the quar­tet was lifted.</p>
        <p>The em­brace in the desert be­tween Saudi Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Salman, de facto ruler of the re­gional hege­mon, and Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Ha­mad Al-Thani was no doubt a mo­ment for the cam­eras. It is also a de­vel­op­ment that has sev­eral more an­gles to it than a sim­ple Be­douin dis­pute.</p>
        <p>For one thing, it un­der­scores just how quickly things can change when key play­ers in a re­gion feel they are poised to get special at­ten­tion from Washington, favourable or, in this case, un­favourable.</p>
        <p>SUB­TLE POWER SHIFTS</p>
        <p>It also masks some sub­tle power shifts. Qatar has shown that even the small­est states do not need to yield to un­equal treat­ment from a larger, pow­er­ful neigh­bour as long as they have the wits, hedg­ing op­tions and, need­less to say, strate­gic pa­tience for the land­scape to clear up.</p>
        <p>The UAE, thanks in part to the bril­liant strate­gic minds of Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Zayed and his Min­is­ter of State for For­eign Af­fairs An­war Gar­gash, has ma­noeu­vred it­self into pole po­si­tion in the Gulf over the past year. It is out of the war in Ye­men, which it pros­e­cuted along­side Saudi Ara­bia to take on Iran-backed Houthi rebels, has nor­malised ties with Is­rael, toned down its stri­dency on Iran, and is poised to be the first Arab na­tion likely to get the top-of-the-line F-35 stealth fighter from the US.</p>
        <p>The close ties be­tween the</p>
        <p>Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and his younger Saudi coun­ter­part is thought to have led the Saudis to make their lat­est, un­suc­cess­ful bid to bring Qatar to heel four years ago. How­ever, while the Emi­rati got out of the mess in time, his mentee – some now would say former pro­tege – has some catch­ing up to do both in ex­tri­cat­ing him­self from the Ye­meni quag­mire and in the tricky gam­bit of nor­mal­is­ing his own state-to-state ties with Is­rael, no mat­ter what the on­go­ing pri­vate con­tacts be­tween them may be.</p>
        <p>It is note­wor­thy that Abu Dhabi’s Prince Mo­hammed, Bahrain’s</p>
        <p>King Ha­mad and Egyp­tian Pres­i­dent Ab­del Fat­tah el-Sisi all chose to stay away from the fence-mend­ing sum­mit, send­ing stand-ins to watch the show of good faith, in­clud­ing the Saudi Crown Prince char­i­o­teer­ing the Qatari ruler around in his SUV.</p>
        <p>The UAE, for in­stance, sent Sheikh Mo­hammed bin Rashid Al Mak­toum, Vice-Pres­i­dent and Prime Min­is­ter. Sheikh Mo­hammed, who is ruler of Dubai, keeps a wary eye on the Saudi Crown Prince’s ef­forts to woo more global firms to base their re­gional oper­a­tions out of Riyadh and away from his own glit­ter­ing city, the Gulf’s premier hub.</p>
        <p>ALL SET FOR BI­DEN</p>
        <p>As US Pres­i­dent-elect Joe Bi­den, a staunch sup­porter of Is­rael, pre­pares to take of­fice, the United States has its al­lies in the re­gion in line. The GCC deal on Qatar re­moves a stone from the shoes of US al­lies and part­ners far­ther afield as well; Ja­pan, South Korea and In­dia ac­count for 75 per cent of Qatar’s liq­ue­fied nat­u­ral gas ex­ports.</p>
        <p>Mil­i­tar­ily, the US al­ready has hundreds of fourth-gen­er­a­tion fight­ers with Gulf and Arab forces it can call upon for net­work-cen­tric, com­mand and con­trol op­er­a­tional ca­pa­bil­i­ties. The F-35, so far sold only to Is­rael, will add to that heft.</p>
        <p>At a time when his na­tion’s own en­ergy self-suf­fi­ciency is as­sured, the new Amer­i­can leader is free to fo­cus at­ten­tion and en­ergy on Iran. The Qatar deal helps in this be­cause Doha has had a strong work­ing re­la­tion­ship with Te­heran and now needs less use of its airspace for the use of Qatar Air­ways, a fac­tor that will no doubt help Mr Bi­den pres­sure Iran as he ne­go­ti­ates to re­vive the nu­clear agree­ment that Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump had tossed out.</p>
        <p>For the rest of Asia, what all this means is that Mr Bi­den has more ex­ec­u­tive time to fo­cus on Amer­ica’s No. 1 strate­gic chal­lenge – China.</p>
        <p>With both houses of Congress now in Demo­cratic con­trol – the split Se­nate will see Vice-Pres­i­dent-elect Ka­mala Har­ris pos­si­bly need­ing to ex­er­cise her cast­ing vote fre­quently – Mr Bi­den’s do­mes­tic headache is re­duced some­what. Speedy ap­point­ments of am­bas­sadors to Asia also are guar­an­teed; cer­tainly, it is un­likely that key na­tions will be ne­glected for the du­ra­tion of a pres­i­den­tial term, as hap­pened un­der Mr Trump.</p>
        <p>South-east Asia should be ready for what is to come. Should Mr Bi­den re­tain the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion’s plan to have an In­dian Ocean fleet, or try to set up an al­liance of democ­ra­cies – the Quadri­lat­eral Se­cu­rity Di­a­logue group­ing the US, Ja­pan, Aus­tralia and In­dia is a start­ing point – the US at­ten­tion that some Asian an­a­lysts prayed for might show up sooner rather than later.</p>
        <p>SMALL STATES LES­SON</p>
        <p>That aside, the deal in the desert over Qatar holds im­por­tant lessons for South-east Asia. At the end of the day, its tus­sle with Saudi Ara­bia was a classic one of a small state re­sist­ing at­tempts to be shown its place in the neigh­bour­hood by the big­ger power.</p>
        <p>In­deed, the cur­rent Emir’s fa­ther, Emir Ha­mad bin Khal­ifa Al Thani, or­gan­ised the suc­cess­ful 1995 coup against his fa­ther pre­cisely be­cause he con­sid­ered his fa­ther too be­holden to the Saudis. Since then, Qatari wealth and power have only grown as the emi­rate emerged as the world’s largest gas sup­plier.</p>
        <p>Saudis did try to re­verse the coup, un­suc­cess­fully, tak­ing help from some of the very forces that also backed its 2017 block­ade. Qatar’s ties to Turkey and Iran were de­vel­oped as a tri­an­gu­la­tion at­tempt to keep the Saudis at bay.</p>
        <p>Saudi pres­sure didn’t work be­cause Qataris had the smarts; for in­stance, once al­most en­tirely de­pen­dent on Saudi Ara­bia, the only na­tion with which it has a land bor­der, and the UAE for its milk sup­plies, it built up an en­tire dairy in­dus­try from scratch in a short time.</p>
        <p>By next year, it ex­pects to have more than a thou­sand farms, cov­er­ing an area of 18,200ha that would use hy­dro­pon­ics as well as other tech­nol­ogy that aids cul­ti­va­tion with less wa­ter and soil.</p>
        <p>And the UAE paid a price when</p>
        <p>Qataris cut their de­pen­dence on Jebel Ali and built their own first-class port and free trade zones.</p>
        <p>In the af­ter­math of the 2017 sanc­tions, Turkey, ruled by a regime that has close ties with the Mus­lim Broth­er­hood which is so de­spised by both the Saudi and the Emi­rati elite, has only seen its in­flu­ence grow with Qatar. It sent troops to Qatar within weeks of the Saudi block­ade to give a form of phys­i­cal pro­tec­tion to the coun­try and Iran opened its airspace to Qatar Air­ways, earn­ing use­ful for­eign ex­change in the process for its sanc­tions-hit econ­omy.</p>
        <p>It is not clear what Qatar sur­ren­dered to clinch the deal; as much as it looks like the vic­tor in the tan­gle there surely must have been com­pro­mises made.</p>
        <p>For a while, it has been said that Doha had been us­ing Jewish lobby groups in the US to pres­sure the White House to lean on Saudi Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Salman. It is also pos­si­ble that it has gone some way to as­suage the UAE’s hub as­pi­ra­tions by agree­ing to hold some of the 2022 World Cup foot­ball matches in the Emi­rates, thus turn­ing the games into more of an “Arab World Cup” than just a Qatari-hosted one.</p>
        <p>It may even have some sur­prises in store vis-a-vis Is­rael, which it has not of­fi­cially recog­nised but whose com­mer­cial of­fice it has hosted in Doha for a quar­ter cen­tury.</p>
        <p>Al­though every­one is po­lite around Saudi Ara­bia, the Arab world knows that the Saudis over­reached. By go­ing all out against Qatar, it had very few cards left in its hand when it be­came ob­vi­ous that the Qataris proved more durable than Riyadh had sized them up to be. Think of it as some­thing akin to Deng Xiaop­ing’s ef­forts to “teach a les­son” to Viet­nam in 1979.</p>
        <p>Qataris are cheer­ing the restora­tion of ties with Saudi Ara­bia, the United Arab Emi­rates, Bahrain and Egypt af­ter the block­ade im­posed in 2017 by the quar­tet was lifted. The em­brace in the desert be­tween Saudi Crown Prince Mo­hammed bin Salman, de facto ruler of the re­gional hege­mon, and Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Ha­mad Al-Thani was no doubt a mo­ment for the cam­eras. It is also a de­vel­op­ment that has sev­eral more an­gles to it than a sim­ple Be­douin dis­pute.</p>
