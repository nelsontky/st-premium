    <p>Res­i­dents from about 633 house­holds stay­ing in five Hous­ing Board blocks in Tampines can now track their blocks’ util­i­ties us­age at “eco boards” in­stalled at their lift lob­bies un­der a pi­lot pro­gramme.</p>
    <p>The dig­i­tal boards pro­vide real-time fig­ures of the block’s ag­gre­gated wa­ter and elec­tric­ity con­sump­tion and the re­sult­ing car­bon emis­sions gen­er­ated over the pre­vi­ous 24 hours.</p>
    <p>They also of­fer res­i­dents tips on low­er­ing their util­i­ties con­sump­tion and will let them take part in en­ergy-sav­ing chal­lenges through com­pe­ti­tions with other blocks.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing at the launch event yes­ter­day morn­ing at Block 878A in Tampines Av­enue 8, Min­is­ter for So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment Masa­gos Zulk­i­fli said the eco boards are part of the Tampines Town Coun­cil’s ef­fort to make the es­tate Sin­ga­pore’s first “eco town”.</p>
    <p>Mr Masa­gos, who is the MP for the Tampines West ward of Tampines GRC, noted that Sin­ga­pore is aim­ing to re­duce the amount of wa­ter used by house­holds to 130 litres per per­son daily by 2030, down from the cur­rent amount of about 140 litres daily.</p>
    <p>“To get there, there are a lot of things that need to be done. First, we need to get in­for­ma­tion to our res­i­dents for them to know how they com­pare with oth­ers in terms of us­age and what they can do to re­duce their wa­ter us­age over time.”</p>
    <p>Three other Tampines GRC MPs – Ms Cheng Li Hui, Mr Des­mond Choo and Mr Baey Yam Keng – also at­tended the launch.</p>
    <p>More eco boards will be in­stalled at five other blocks in Tampines over the next two months un­der the pi­lot, which will last about six months.</p>
    <p>The pro­gramme is the re­sult of a part­ner­ship be­tween Tampines Town Coun­cil and util­i­ties provider SP Group, which de­signed and de­vel­oped the boards.</p>
    <p>Mr Chang Sau Sheong, chief ex­ec­u­tive of en­ergy tech com­pany SP Dig­i­tal un­der SP Group, said dur­ing the launch that the boards will com­ple­ment the SP Util­i­ties app, which was rolled out in 2015 to let con­sumers track their in­di­vid­ual con­sump­tion.</p>
    <p>On top of its main aim to change res­i­dents’ be­hav­iour and nudge them to re­duce their con­sump­tion, the boards will also help the town coun­cil and mu­nic­i­pal op­er­a­tors im­prove es­tate man­age­ment ef­fi­ciency by en­abling them to mon­i­tor util­i­ties used for com­mon ar­eas.</p>
    <p>This will al­low them to pick up any anom­alies and re­act quickly, Mr Chang said.</p>
    <p>“To­day, what they have is end of the month (fig­ures). This is of­ten too late, say, if there’s a leak­age in the wa­ter sup­ply or some is­sues with the elec­tric­ity us­age.”</p>
