    <p>It sounds like the plot of a big-bud­get Hol­ly­wood film but ex­perts say it is all too real: In a di­vided United States, a num­ber of ac­tors seek to ei­ther in­flu­ence the presidenti­al elec­tion or ex­ac­er­bate fis­sures in Amer­i­can so­ci­ety with the strate­gic goal of see­ing the coun­try im­plode.</p>
    <p>These ac­tors are not only for­eign pow­ers like Rus­sia, China and Iran, but also non-state play­ers like QAnon – the con­spir­acy the­ory that has moved from the fringes of the far right to the near-main­stream.</p>
    <p>“Rus­sia was the pri­mary player and in­sti­ga­tor in 2016,” said Mr Zach Sch­witzky, co-founder and chief ex­ec­u­tive of Lim­bik, a com­pany that works on cy­ber in­ves­ti­ga­tion with the con­sul­tancy So­ufan Group.</p>
    <p>“They con­tinue to be, from what we’re see­ing,” he told The Straits Times.</p>
    <p>But this year, China, Iran, North Korea and Saudi Ara­bia “could have an im­pact or will try to have an im­pact on the elec­tion... and be­tween elec­tion and in­au­gu­ra­tion”.</p>
    <p>Saudi Ara­bia, he said, was a rel­a­tively un­der­rated player.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion will take place on Nov 3. The win­ner’s in­au­gu­ra­tion will be held on Jan 20.</p>
    <p>“In 2016, Rus­sia was pri­mar­ily try­ing to in­sti­gate,” he said. “Now they’re… more play­ing the role of am­pli­fier. And a lot of the tac­tics that Rus­sia de­fined in 2016 are now be­ing utilised by the Chi­nese, the Saudi Ara­bi­ans, the Ira­ni­ans.”</p>
    <p>This re­al­ity was un­der­scored on Thurs­day when the US Trea­sury des­ig­nated four “Rus­sia-linked in­di­vid­u­als for at­tempt­ing to in­flu­ence Amer­ica’s elec­toral process”.</p>
    <p>On the same day, Mi­crosoft said Rus­sian, Chi­nese and Ira­nian hack­ers have been mount­ing cy­ber at­tacks against hun­dreds of or­gan­i­sa­tions and peo­ple in­volved in the 2020 presidenti­al race and US-Europe pol­icy de­bates.</p>
    <p>Tar­gets in­cluded the cam­paigns of both Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump and former vice-pres­i­dent Joe Bi­den; ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cials; and po­lit­i­cal par­ties, po­lit­i­cal con­sul­tants and think-tanks.</p>
    <p>Mi­crosoft said its se­cu­rity tools had blocked most at­tacks and warned that “for­eign ac­tiv­ity groups have stepped up their ef­forts tar­get­ing the 2020 elec­tion as had been an­tic­i­pated”.</p>
    <p>On Sept 1, Face­book said it had blocked sev­eral ac­counts that were con­nected to Rus­sia’s In­ter­net Re­search Agency.</p>
    <p>This was an­tic­i­pated. On Aug 7, Na­tional Counter-in­tel­li­gence and Se­cu­rity Cen­tre direc­tor Wil­liam Evan­ina listed Rus­sia, China and Iran as the main threats in an “Elec­tion threat up­date for the Amer­i­can pub­lic”.</p>
    <p>Beijing con­sid­ers Mr Trump un­pre­dictable and would pre­fer it if he did not win re-elec­tion, his re­port con­cluded.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia is mainly con­cerned with den­i­grat­ing Mr Bi­den and what it sees as an anti-Rus­sia “es­tab­lish­ment”, it said.</p>
    <p>And Iran was as­sessed to be in­tent on un­der­min­ing the US’ demo­cratic in­sti­tu­tions and di­vid­ing the coun­try.</p>
    <p>China has be­come more ag­gres­sive, said Mr Philip Cowdell, who leads the So­ufan Group’s con­sult­ing prac­tice and spear­heads its ca­pa­bil­i­ties in dis­in­for­ma­tion re­sponse.</p>
    <p>He said: “Coun­tries which have been ben­e­fi­cia­ries of China prod­ucts and sup­port post-Covid-19 get praised and sup­ported. Those which ques­tion the ‘aid’ they re­ceived are lam­basted as un­grate­ful and not good, true sup­port­ers of the regime.</p>
    <p>“They’ve used this op­por­tu­nity to show that they have been the most suc­cess­ful at con­tain­ing Covid, which they’re us­ing as a jus­ti­fi­ca­tion for the ef­fi­cacy of a Com­mu­nist ap­proach.”</p>
    <p>Do­mes­ti­cally, Mr Trump is very ob­vi­ously averse to Rus­sia get­ting any credit at all for his 2016 win – or if he wins again in Novem­ber. The Trump cam­paign is play­ing up the China bo­gey. The Demo­cratic Party wants to harp on the Rus­sia an­gle.</p>
    <p>“Who­ever’s the ben­e­fi­ciary of dis­in­for­ma­tion or in­for­ma­tion op­er­a­tions is not re­ally mo­ti­vated to do or say any­thing about it,” said Mr Sch­witzky.</p>
    <p>Mr Cowdell told The Straits Times: “If the Rus­sian broad agenda is to seed so­ci­etal dis­cord, then they’ve al­ready achieved their goal.”</p>
    <p>Rus­sian ef­forts, while favour­ing Mr Trump, would manipulate both sides of the Amer­i­can di­vide, as ei­ther out­come would con­trib­ute to deep­en­ing fault lines in the US.</p>
    <p>A Bi­den win would en­sure the pen­du­lum swings faster – from the lib­eral glob­al­ist former pres­i­dent Barack Obama to the right-wing con­ser­va­tive na­tivist Mr Trump and back again to a lib­eral Mr Bi­den with the back­ing of the so­cial­ists and pro­gres­sives in the Demo­cratic Party – spark­ing a back­lash.</p>
    <p>“If their goal is mas­sive dis­rup­tion in the US, by ac­tu­ally hav­ing Joe Bi­den win they will cre­ate even more dis­trust and dis­rup­tion… fun­da­men­tally mov­ing from vo­cal dis­cord to phys­i­cal dis­cord on the streets of Amer­ica,” said Mr Cowdell.</p>
    <p>“The goal is dis­cord,” he added. “Think im­mi­gra­tion, race, women’s rights.”</p>
    <p>When the Rus­sian ori­gin on­line posts from 2016 were an­a­lysed, it was found that 80 per cent of them did not talk about the elec­tion but about race.</p>
    <p>“It’s not about chang­ing the elec­toral process, it’s about un­der­min­ing so­ci­ety. It’s pick­ing the top­ics that are hot top­ics for dis­cord,” he said.</p>
