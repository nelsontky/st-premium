    <p>TOKYO • To pull off the first post­poned Olympics in mod­ern his­tory, the Tokyo 2020 or­gan­is­ers have said they will strip out much of the spec­ta­cle that typ­i­cally char­ac­terises the event.</p>
    <p>Now they have to fig­ure out what ex­actly that means.</p>
    <p>As plans be­gin to take shape, the sports di­rec­tor of the Tokyo or­gan­is­ing com­mit­tee, Koji Muro­fushi, says de­tails that used to pre­vi­ously go un­no­ticed, like the sounds ath­letes make in quiet sta­di­ums, will take on more fo­cus.</p>
    <p>That will bring new per­spec­tives and busi­ness op­por­tu­ni­ties.</p>
    <p>Asked the gold medal­list in the men’s ham­mer throw at the Athens 2004 Games: “Have you ever heard the sound of a steel wire at­tached to the ham­mer when it flies through the air?</p>
    <p>“Or the sound of run­ners’ spikes on the track and wa­ter splash­ing at the swim­ming pool?”</p>
    <p>Orig­i­nally sched­uled for this sum­mer, the event was post­poned to July next year ow­ing to the coron­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Or­gan­is­ers are con­sid­er­ing cost cuts in more than 200 ar­eas. That could in­clude lim­it­ing spec­ta­tors and re­duc­ing the size of cer­e­monies, ac­cord­ing to lo­cal me­dia re­ports.</p>
    <p>But the In­ter­na­tional Olympic Com­mit­tee re­mains “care­fully op­ti­mistic” the Tokyo 2020 Games can pro­ceed in good or­der.</p>
    <p>“When I say care­fully op­ti­mistic, it’s be­cause we don’t know what the san­i­tary sit­u­a­tion will be a year from now,” said Olympic Games ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor Christophe Dubi in a pre-recorded speech at the World Win­ter Sports Expo yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>“But we are op­ti­mistic be­cause we know we can do it be­cause we have a fan­tas­tic part­ner­ship with Tokyo.”</p>
    <p>With sec­ond waves of in­fec­tions hit­ting coun­tries around the world, and with­out any vac­cine, the or­gan­is­ers are likely to see con­tin­ued chal­lenges.</p>
    <p>Ac­cord­ing to a Ky­odo News poll con­ducted in July, only one in four peo­ple in Ja­pan sup­ports hold­ing the Games next year.</p>
    <p>Adding to un­cer­tainty is the abrupt res­ig­na­tion of Ja­panese Prime Min­is­ter Shinzo Abe, who played a ma­jor role in Tokyo’s win­ning bid to host.</p>
    <p>How­ever, Muro­fushi, 45, in­sisted that the com­mit­tee is de­voted to the safety of the Games, in­clud­ing fans, with the or­gan­is­ers keen to avoid a closed-door event.</p>
    <p>Tokyo 2020 chief ex­ec­u­tive Toshiro Muto added: “As for the spec­ta­tors, we don’t have any con­clu­sions yet. But if pos­si­ble, we’d like to avoid a ‘no spec­ta­tors’ sit­u­a­tion.”</p>
    <p>An in­terim sum­mary on bor­der con­trols, trans­porta­tion, anti-virus rules, fans and coun­ter­mea­sures for stake­hold­ers is ex­pected by the end of the year, and he be­lieves it will re­as­sure both Ja­panese and for­eign ath­letes that “next year’s Olympics is safe and se­cure be­cause of our coron­avirus mea­sures”.</p>
