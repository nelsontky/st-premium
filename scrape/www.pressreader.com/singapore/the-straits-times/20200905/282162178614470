    <p>SPE­CIAL CON­SID­ER­A­TION</p>
    <p>When con­sid­er­ing these ap­peals, the</p>
    <p>MSF would have taken into ac­count any spe­cial cir­cum­stances that would war­rant spe­cial con­sid­er­a­tion for in­di­vid­ual cases.</p>
    <p>MIN­IS­TER FOR SO­CIAL AND FAM­ILY DE­VEL­OP­MENT MASAGOS ZULK­I­FLI</p>
    <p>About a third of some 115,000 Sin­ga­pore res­i­dents who ap­plied for the Covid-19 Sup­port Grant were re­jected, said So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment Min­is­ter Masagos Zulk­i­fli.</p>
    <p>The grant, which gives up to $800 a month for three months, is aimed at help­ing Sin­ga­pore­ans and per­ma­nent res­i­dents who have lost their jobs or suf­fered a ma­jor drop in in­come dur­ing the on­go­ing pan­demic.</p>
    <p>In a writ­ten re­ply to a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion from Mr Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC), Mr Masagos yes­ter­day said about 41,000 ap­pli­cants were un­suc­cess­ful.</p>
    <p>The Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily De­vel­op­ment (MSF) ap­proved the grant for about 65,000 peo­ple, and as at Aug 16, about 9,000 ap­pli­ca­tions were still be­ing pro­cessed.</p>
    <p>Most of the ap­pli­ca­tions were re­jected be­cause the ap­pli­cants did not meet the el­i­gi­bil­ity re­quire­ments, such as be­ing re­trenched or hav­ing had their salary cut by at least 30 per cent for at least three con­sec­u­tive months.</p>
    <p>Oth­ers pro­vided em­ploy­ment-re­lated de­tails that could not be ver­i­fied, or they did not meet the house­hold in­come cri­te­ria.</p>
    <p>Mr Chua, a Work­ers’ Party MP, had asked, among other things, for a break­down of the num­ber of peo­ple who were un­suc­cess­ful in ob­tain­ing the grant, and the num­ber of ap­pli­cants who were re­jected but who re­ceived the grant af­ter an ap­peal or when they ap­plied again.</p>
    <p>In his re­ply, Mr Masagos said the MSF, as at Aug 16, had re­ceived</p>
    <p>about 8,000 ap­peals for the grant, and about 7,500 were ap­proved.</p>
    <p>He said: “When con­sid­er­ing these ap­peals, MSF would have taken into ac­count any spe­cial cir­cum­stances that would war­rant spe­cial con­sid­er­a­tion for in­di­vid­ual cases.”</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately, Mr Masagos ad­dressed a ques­tion from Mr Leon Per­era (Alju­nied GRC), who had asked for an up­date on an up­com­ing sur­vey on the Vul­ner­a­ble-InCom­mu­nity Net­work, and if the find­ings of the sur­vey would be made pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The net­work, com­pris­ing a mix of gov­ern­ment and com­mu­nity groups, was set up last Novem­ber to be­friend and ex­tend help to vul­ner­a­ble in­di­vid­u­als, such as those who sell tis­sue pa­per on the move, and</p>
    <p>card­board col­lec­tors.</p>
    <p>In his writ­ten re­ply, Mr Masagos said the sur­vey aims to bet­ter un­der­stand the needs of the peo­ple the net­work has con­nected with, so that it can pro­vide more tar­geted sup­port for them.</p>
    <p>He said the min­istry plans to con­duct the sur­vey to­wards the end of the year, and it is likely to take a few months to com­plete. MSF will re­lease the ag­gre­gated sur­vey re­sult when it is ready, he added.</p>
    <p>In an­other writ­ten re­ply to a par­lia­men­tary ques­tion from Mr Christo­pher de Souza (Hol­landBukit Timah GRC), Mr Masagos dis­cussed the Spe­cial Needs Sav­ing Scheme.</p>
    <p>Mr de Souza had asked if MSF would al­low par­ents with spe­cial</p>
    <p>needs chil­dren to spec­ify who will get the re­main­ing money in the scheme if a child with dis­abil­i­ties dies be­fore the par­ents do.</p>
    <p>The scheme en­ables par­ents to set aside Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund (CPF) sav­ings for the long-term care of chil­dren with spe­cial needs.</p>
    <p>Par­ents can nom­i­nate these chil­dren to re­ceive reg­u­lar pay­outs af­ter the par­ents die.</p>
    <p>How­ever, if the child dies be­fore the par­ents, the CPF money meant for the child re­mains in the par­ents’ CPF ac­count. The par­ents, if they wish, can up­date their CPF nom­i­na­tion to spec­ify how their CPF sav­ings will be dis­trib­uted when they die, Mr Masagos said.</p>
