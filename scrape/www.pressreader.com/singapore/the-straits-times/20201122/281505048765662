    <p>You learn new rit­u­als in a pan­demic. Be­fore we start our weeknight shifts at the mi­grant work­ers’ clinic, we don our per­sonal pro­tec­tive equip­ment (PPE).</p>
    <p>I tug the tight straps of the N95 mask over my head and pinch the metal strip over my nose. Sani­tiser. Then the pro­tec­tive gown, closed up at the back with mask­ing tape. More sani­tiser. Hair­net, face shield. One pair of gloves, taped around my wrists to form a makeshift seal. Se­cond pair of gloves. More sani­tiser.</p>
    <p>Fi­nally, as we are now nigh un­recog­nis­able, we write our names on bits of tape and stick them on our fronts. Some of us add smiley faces. You do not see many smiles on real faces th­ese days.</p>
    <p>For the past four years, I have been vol­un­teer­ing as a clinic as­sis­tant at the HealthServ­e clinic in Gey­lang, which of­fers sub­sidised treat­ment for mi­grant work­ers in Sin­ga­pore. It serves mostly con­struc­tion or ship­yard work­ers from Bangladesh, China and In­dia, who queue three days a week for a slot with the doc­tors and den­tist on duty.</p>
    <p>With the coron­avirus pan­demic – dur­ing which tens of thousands of mi­grant work­ers in Sin­ga­pore dor­mi­to­ries were in­fected – the clinic has evolved.</p>
    <p>The pa­tients used to sit knee to knee in the clinic; now they wait out­side, spaced out across the grass. Pa­tients with acute re­s­pi­ra­tory in­fec­tions are seen in a sep­a­rate room, which is swel­ter­ing de­spite be­ing ven­ti­lated by so many fans that talk­ing in it is like shout­ing in a wind tun­nel.</p>
    <p>Reg­is­ter­ing pa­tients now in­volves ask­ing them a set of ques­tions. Have they been in con­tact with a Covid-19 case in the past 14 days? They re­act with alarm at the very idea. Do they live or work in a Covid-19 high-risk area – say, a dor­mi­tory? More de­nials. Have they left Sin­ga­pore in the past 14 days? They throw me in­cred­u­lous looks. What do I think?</p>
    <p>Hav­ing no med­i­cal train­ing, I could not vol­un­teer dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod and so have only the barest inkling of those dark times, when the mi­grant ad­vo­cacy groups of Sin­ga­pore were needed most and had to do their best with very lit­tle.</p>
    <p>I re­turned in Au­gust to the new rit­u­als. I dis­cov­ered that be­ing in PPE takes get­ting used to, even for the scant three hours of my shift.</p>
    <p>There are the N95 headaches. There is the fid­dly process of open­ing Zi­ploc bags with gloved fin­gers. There is the breath­less­ness, the sour taste of the same stale air cir­cling the pocket of your mouth.</p>
    <p>But the hard­est thing is try­ing to talk to other peo­ple. The mask muf­fles your words. Be­tween the lay­ers of plas­tic and the lan­guage bar­rier, you shout un­til you are hoarse.</p>
    <p>Even then, you know that none of your ques­tions is big enough to en­cap­su­late what a per­son has been through. How did they pass the in­ert days of lock­down, how wide was the space be­tween their beds? How are their fam­i­lies? Have they enough to live on?</p>
    <p>“Six months, no work,” some­one tells you as you take his tem­per­a­ture. “No money. But to­mor­row I start, so it’s okay.”</p>
    <p>He takes a queue num­ber and makes way for the next in line.</p>
    <p>Though Sin­ga­pore is grad­u­ally re­open­ing, mi­grant work­ers are still mostly re­stricted to their work­places, dor­mi­to­ries and ap­proved lo­ca­tions like recre­ation cen­tres.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, many were placed un­der lock­down to re­duce vi­ral spread. Some would com­plete one stretch of quar­an­tine, only for an­other in­fec­tion to arise in their co­hort, a Sisyphean rock rolling them all back down the hill.</p>
    <p>“I am run­ning in vain,” writes Bangladesh­i con­struc­tion safety su­per­vi­sor Md Sharif Ud­din in his poem The Death Of Wishes, in which he dreams of wan­der­ing around Sin­ga­pore: rid­ing on bus 67, read­ing in the li­brary and lis­ten­ing to the foun­tains at Jewel Changi Air­port. “But wishes are lost in the city. All de­sires are blocked by four walls. I am a monk at night. The day is dust.”</p>
    <p>The toll the pan­demic has taken on the men­tal health of mi­grant work­ers is in­vis­i­ble and im­mense. I talk on the phone with an­other poet, con­struc­tion worker Md Mukul Hos­sine, who went home to Bangladesh to visit his sick father and was stranded there when Covid-19 closed bor­ders.</p>
    <p>Since he can­not work, he has been vol­un­teer­ing with the SG Ac­ci­dent Help Cen­tre hot­line, field­ing What­sApp calls from dis­tressed work­ers in Ben­gali. Dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker, he took 10 to 12 calls a day. Peo­ple call ask­ing for food or medicine, he says. Some are not get­ting paid. Some want to go home be­cause their par­ents are crit­i­cally ill.</p>
    <p>He tells me about the man who learnt in lock­down that his four-year-old daugh­ter had died. He wanted des­per­ately to re­turn home. Mukul called him back over the next 10 days, per­suad­ing him that, dev­as­tat­ing though the loss of his child might be, his fam­ily re­lied on him to do the sen­si­ble thing and stay put in Sin­ga­pore to keep his job. Hell of a choice. But this coun­try is built on choices like this. The num­ber of Covid-19 cases in dor­mi­to­ries has gone down. Some­times I find my­self think­ing that it is all go­ing back to nor­mal. Peo­ple have the prob­lems they had be­fore the pan­demic. The di­a­betes, the hy­per­ten­sion, the bleed­ing of ears from ov­er­en­thu­si­as­tic Q-tip­ping.</p>
    <p>And still in the mar­gins, you see “work­place ac­ci­dent”. You see “claims boss locked him in a room, punched him in the head, kicked him in the back”. You see “called po­lice and went to hos­pi­tal but could not af­ford med­i­cal fees, boss would not pay”. You think: Is this the nor­mal we are go­ing back to?</p>
    <p>Some weeks ago, I was in a car on the ex­press­way. Ahead of me was a lorry packed with mi­grant work­ers, in all de­fi­ance of the so­cial dis­tanc­ing reg­u­la­tions the Govern­ment has im­pressed upon em­ploy­ers.</p>
    <p>It be­gan to rain heav­ily. The work­ers stood up in the mov­ing lorry and tried un­steadily to put up a tarp for shel­ter. The road di­verged then, and the work­ers went one way, still strug­gling with the tarp, and I went the other, safe and dry.</p>
    <p>The out­break of Covid-19 in the mi­grant worker com­mu­nity was a reck­on­ing for the Sin­ga­porean con­science, prompt­ing an out­cry to im­prove their liv­ing con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>Since then, many new mea­sures have been put in place, from the Quick Build Dor­mi­to­ries to re­duce hous­ing den­sity to the re­cently an­nounced Pro­ject Dawn task force to boost men­tal health­care and sup­port for work­ers.</p>
    <p>But it is a very long road we are on. As the ur­gency of the pan­demic ebbs, I fear we are com­ing to the fork in the road where Sin­ga­pore­ans will go one way and the tran­sient work­force sup­port­ing them will go an­other.</p>
    <p>Yet I have seen so much good in the pan­demic. The doc­tor who steps up to do three clinic shifts a week when oth­ers drop out. The nurse who swabs 70 peo­ple a day for Covid-19 and still comes over at night to dis­pense med­i­ca­tion. The pa­tient with di­ar­rhoea who gives up his place in the line, which he has held for hours, to some­one with a fever.</p>
    <p>The peo­ple who send money, the peo­ple who de­liver sup­plies, the peo­ple who speak up. All of them re­defin­ing, cen­time­tre by cen­time­tre, day by day, what nor­mal means.</p>
    <p>At the end of each clinic shift, we dis­in­fect all the sur­faces, the queue cards and the face shields. Out­side, we tear off the gloves, the gowns, the masks and all the in­su­la­tion we are priv­i­leged to have.</p>
    <p>For a few sec­onds, we stand in the open, cheeks creased, gulp­ing the air. This is the only time we see one an­other’s faces.</p>
    <p>Some­times, be­fore we put our ev­ery­day masks back on and head off into the night, we get to see one an­other’s smile.</p>
