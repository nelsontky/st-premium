    <p>Seven virus test­ing pro­fes­sion­als from the Chi­nese main­land ar­rived in Hong Kong yes­ter­day af­ter­noon as the first batch of sup­port teams to tackle the spread of Covid-19 in the city. Mean­while, the Viet­namese gov­ern­ment will test all 1.1 mil­lion res­i­dents of Danang, the city at the cen­tre of a coro­n­avirus outbreak.</p>
    <p>HONG KONG/HANOI • Seven virus test­ing pro­fes­sion­als from the Chi­nese main­land ar­rived in Hong Kong yes­ter­day af­ter­noon as the first batch of main­land sup­port­ive teams to help tackle a wors­en­ing spread of Covid-19 in the city.</p>
    <p>The med­i­cal pro­fes­sion­als, who will help with lab­o­ra­tory work, are mem­bers of a 60-strong nu­cleic acid test­ing team es­tab­lished re­cently at the re­quest of the Hong Kong Spe­cial Ad­min­is­tra­tive Re­gion gov­ern­ment for as­sis­tance in the bat­tle against the epi­demic.</p>
    <p>Their ar­rival came at the time of a surge in Covid-19 in­fec­tions in Hong Kong, where med­i­cal re­sources have been stretched to the limit and virus test­ing ca­pac­ity is in­suf­fi­cient.</p>
    <p>Mem­bers of the team were se­lected from over 20 pub­lic hos­pi­tals in Guang­dong prov­ince. The team’s leader used to head the prov­ince’s sup­port­ive group to Wuhan, the cap­i­tal of Hubei prov­ince.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional Health Com­mis­sion said it will con­tinue to as­sem­ble main­land med­i­cal re­sources and send more sup­port at any time based on the Hong Kong gov­ern­ment’s needs to fight the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Six medics from Wuhan, where the virus outbreak first oc­curred, will also be sent to Hong Kong to help build a mo­bile hos­pi­tal to ad­mit pa­tients with mild symp­toms, the com­mis­sion said.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese state broad­caster CCTV re­ported on Satur­day that all 7.5 mil­lion Hong Kong res­i­dents will re­ceive free virus test­ing, with­out cit­ing sources.</p>
    <p>The re­port also es­ti­mated that the test­ing could be com­pleted within a few days.</p>
    <p>The ini­tia­tive is the first time that main­land health of­fi­cials have as­sisted Hong Kong in its bat­tle to con­trol the coro­n­avirus. Some lo­cal res­i­dents fear that China may use this as an ex­cuse to col­lect DNA sam­ples for surveil­lance pur­poses.</p>
    <p>Hong Kong’s Chief Ex­ec­u­tive Car­rie Lam said on Satur­day that the city asked for help from the cen­tral gov­ern­ment due to the resur­gence in cases.</p>
    <p>The Chi­nese ter­ri­tory saw a surge in lo­cally trans­mit­ted coro­n­avirus cases last month and in­tro­duced a raft of tight­en­ing mea­sures that in­cluded re­strict­ing gath­er­ings to two peo­ple and man­dat­ing face masks in all out­door pub­lic spa­ces.</p>
    <p>It recorded 125 new Covid-19 cases on Satur­day, the 11th day in a row that the city’s daily caseload has ex­ceeded 100.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam said last Fri­day that the key Leg­isla­tive Coun­cil elec­tion sched­uled for Septem­ber will be post­poned for a year, due to the re­cent virus surge.</p>
    <p>Sep­a­rately in Viet­nam, the gov­ern­ment will test all 1.1 mil­lion res­i­dents of Danang, the city at the cen­tre of a coro­n­avirus outbreak, Tuoi Tre news­pa­per re­ported, as the risk of a widen­ing spread in­creased.</p>
    <p>There were two more con­firmed cases linked to the Danang outbreak, the Health Min­istry said yes­ter­day, while an­other two were im­ported in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>More than 800,000 peo­ple had trav­elled to the coastal city since July 1, and re­turned to their home prov­inces and cities, ac­cord­ing to the gov­ern­ment, while about 41,000 peo­ple had vis­ited three hos­pi­tals there where most of the in­fec­tions oc­curred.</p>
    <p>The fi­nan­cial hub of Ho Chi Minh City recorded three cases af­ter test­ing more than 21,000 res­i­dents as of yes­ter­day, out of 32,000 who said they vis­ited Danang in the past month.</p>
    <p>Hanoi has quick-tested nearly 50,000 peo­ple who re­turned from Danang as of Satur­day, ac­cord­ing to the city’s gov­ern­ment, which said that an es­ti­mated 72,275 of its res­i­dents had been in the coastal city since July 8.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam has re­ported 174 new virus pa­tients, mostly from Danang, since July 25 when the first lo­cally trans­mit­ted case was con­firmed af­ter more than three months. Viet­nam has re­ported 590 virus cases, in­clud­ing 214 un­der treat­ment and three deaths.</p>
