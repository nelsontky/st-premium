    <p>Ju­liana Seow has worn many hats in sport – from national fencer to coach to pres­i­dent of Fenc­ing Sin­ga­pore – and she hopes her ex­pe­ri­ence will help her in her new role as vice-pres­i­dent of the Sin­ga­pore National Olympic Coun­cil (SNOC).</p>
    <p>The 48-year-old said: “What­ever po­si­tion I’m in, I’ll al­ways want to con­trib­ute and make sport a bet­ter place.</p>
    <p>“I’ve been an ath­lete and a coach so I know what it feels like and I hope with my ex­pe­ri­ence, I can em­pathise with ev­ery sit­u­a­tion and find a win-win so­lu­tion.”</p>
    <p>Seow and Sin­ga­pore Bowl­ing Fed­er­a­tion chief Jessie Phua were elected vice-pres­i­dents at the SNOC’s vir­tual an­nual gen­eral meet­ing (AGM) last night.</p>
    <p>Phua was de­fend­ing her seat</p>
    <p>while the other post had been va­cated by Dr Tan Eng Liang, who stood down af­ter 28 years of ser­vice.</p>
    <p>The other can­di­date in the race</p>
    <p>was former sepak takraw pres­i­dent Ab­dul Halim Kader.</p>
    <p>Phua and Seow will serve un­til 2024, join­ing in­cum­bent vice-pres­i­dents Bene­dict Tan and Mi­lan</p>
    <p>Kwee, who were elected at the 2018 AGM and will serve till 2022.</p>
    <p>The AGM was held via video con­fer­enc­ing be­cause of Covid-19 re­stric­tions and was at­tended by 225 rep­re­sen­ta­tives from 54 national sports as­so­ci­a­tions (NSAs).</p>
    <p>Seow paid trib­ute to Dr Tan, say­ing yes­ter­day: “I hope I can be as ef­fec­tive as Dr Tan, who has been a great role model.</p>
    <p>“He can be tough and strict but he’s also very car­ing and em­pa­thetic. He’s a very hands-on per­son who al­ways looks to find the root of the prob­lem.</p>
    <p>“I have many role mod­els in­clud­ing Jessie and Mi­lan and I hope to learn the best from ev­ery­one and cre­ate a unique iden­tity for my­self, but what’s more im­por­tant is I want sport to be­come a greater pas­sion for us.</p>
    <p>“I truly be­lieve that sport helps to build char­ac­ter, es­pe­cially in these cir­cum­stances when we need a lot of re­silience to push our­selves through.”</p>
    <p>Phua, who has been in the seat since 2014, added that the big­gest chal­lenge for most NSAs now is how to main­tain in­ter­est in their re­spec­tive sports dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>“Now it’s for our col­leagues in the sport­ing com­mu­nity to col­lec­tively get over this and meet this chal­lenge,” said the 65-year-old.</p>
    <p>“It’s up to us how we can be more cre­ative to keep the en­gage­ment there and to keep peo­ple en­thused so that when the light at the end of tun­nel gets big­ger and brighter, we can emerge and hit the ground run­ning.</p>
    <p>“I hope sport will con­tinue to be the uni­fier that brings all Sin­ga­pore­ans to­gether.”</p>
