    <p>A woman who pleaded guilty to throw­ing her new­born son into a rub­bish chute with the in­ten­tion of killing him was given an 18-month jail term yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The court heard that the 27-yearold Sin­ga­porean gave birth in the toi­let of her flat on Jan 7, placed the baby in a plas­tic bag and tossed him down the rub­bish chute from the third floor of a Hous­ing Board block in Be­dok North at about 6.15am.</p>
    <p>The mother, who can­not be named be­cause of a gag or­der to pro­tect the baby’s iden­tity, claimed that be­fore giv­ing birth, she did not know she was preg­nant.</p>
    <p>The baby was found more than two hours later by two town coun­cil clean­ers work­ing at the block of flats.</p>
    <p>The baby suf­fered mi­nor in­juries and is in fos­ter care.</p>
    <p>There was no men­tion of the baby’s fa­ther in court doc­u­ments.</p>
    <p>The pros­e­cu­tion had called for the woman to be given at least two years’ jail.</p>
    <p>How­ever, her lawyer, Ms Arias Lim from K&L Gates Straits Law, ar­gued for a “human touch” in what she said was an un­usual case, since the baby sur­vived and the woman has tried un­suc­cess­fully to see her child through the Min­istry of So­cial and Fam­ily Devel­op­ment.</p>
    <p>Ms Lim said her client acted out of shock as, in that one mo­ment, she went from be­ing a young, sin­gle woman to a mother.</p>
    <p>A part-time wait­ress and cleaner at the time, the woman felt pain in her ab­domen and went to the toi­let in the early hours of Jan 7.</p>
    <p>Al­though she had not had her pe­riod for many months and won­dered if she was preg­nant, she chose not to “dwell on it fur­ther”, the court heard.</p>
    <p>Her fam­ily was also un­aware that she was preg­nant.</p>
    <p>After she threw out the baby, she cleaned up the blood in the house, took a shower and went back to sleep.</p>
    <p>The clean­ers heard the baby’s cries com­ing from a white plas­tic bag.</p>
    <p>A prop­erty of­fi­cer from the town coun­cil later tore open the bag tied in a dead knot and found the cry­ing baby cov­ered in blood.</p>
    <p>The baby was taken to KK Women’s and Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal where he was di­ag­nosed with a frac­tured clav­i­cle, which a doc­tor said could be traced to a birth in­jury.</p>
    <p>Po­lice went door to door at the block the next day, but the mother de­nied know­ing any­thing about it.</p>
    <p>On Feb 9, the po­lice told her to report to the po­lice sta­tion on Feb 14 for an in­ter­view and a DNA test.</p>
    <p>But on the eve of the ap­point­ment, she turned her­self in.</p>
    <p>A psy­chi­a­trist from the In­sti­tute of Men­tal Health found that she was not suf­fer­ing from a ma­jor men­tal ill­ness at the time of the of­fence.</p>
    <p>The as­sess­ment was among the rea­sons that led Deputy Pub­lic Pros­e­cu­tor Yan Ji­akang to ar­gue that the woman was cog­nisant enough to clean up after her­self.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing sen­tenc­ing, Dis­trict Judge Salina Ishak said re­ha­bil­i­ta­tion did not dis­place de­ter­rence in this case and a pro­ba­tion or­der was not ap­pro­pri­ate.</p>
    <p>She also took into ac­count the baby’s vul­ner­a­bil­ity and that he was thrown from a height into an un­san­i­tary en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
