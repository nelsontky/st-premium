    <p>• A Chi­nese court yes­ter­day handed down a four-year jail term to a cit­i­zen jour­nal­ist who re­ported from the cen­tral city of Wuhan at the peak of the coro­n­avirus out­break, on grounds of “pick­ing quar­rels and pro­vok­ing trou­ble”, her lawyer said.</p>
    <p>Zhang Zhan, 37, the first such per­son known to have been tried over the mat­ter, was among a hand­ful of peo­ple whose first-hand ac­counts from crowded hos­pi­tals and empty streets painted a more dire pic­ture of the pan­demic epi­cen­tre than the of­fi­cial nar­ra­tive.</p>
    <p>“We will prob­a­bly ap­peal,” the lawyer, Mr Ren Quan­niu, told Reuters.</p>
    <p>“Ms Zhang be­lieves she is be­ing per­se­cuted for ex­er­cis­ing her free­dom of speech,” he had said be­fore the trial.</p>
    <p>Crit­i­cism of China’s early han­dling of the crisis has been cen­sored, and whis­tle-blow­ers, such as doc­tors, have been warned. State me­dia has cred­ited suc­cess in rein­ing in the coro­n­avirus pan­demic to the lead­er­ship of Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping.</p>
    <p>The virus has spread world­wide to in­fect more than 80 mil­lion peo­ple and kill over 1.76 mil­lion.</p>
    <p>In Shang­hai, po­lice en­forced tight se­cu­rity out­side the court where the trial opened seven months after Zhang’s de­ten­tion, al­though some sup­port­ers were un­de­terred.</p>
    <p>A man in a wheel­chair, who told Reuters he came from the cen­tral province of He­nan to demon­strate sup­port for Zhang, wrote her name on a poster be­fore po­lice ar­rived to es­cort him away.</p>
    <p>For­eign jour­nal­ists were de­nied en­try to the court “due to the epi­demic”, court se­cu­rity of­fi­cials said.</p>
    <p>Zhang, a for­mer lawyer, had ar­rived in Wuhan on Feb 1 from her home in Shang­hai.</p>
    <p>Her short video clips up­loaded to YouTube con­sist of in­ter­views with res­i­dents, com­men­tary and footage of a cre­ma­to­rium, train sta­tions, hos­pi­tals and the Wuhan In­sti­tute of Virol­ogy.</p>
    <p>De­tained in mid-May, she went on a hunger strike in late June, ac­cord­ing to court doc­u­ments seen by Reuters. Her lawyers told the court that po­lice strapped her hands and force-fed her with a tube. By this month, she was suf­fer­ing headaches, gid­di­ness, stom­ach ache, low blood pres­sure and a throat in­fec­tion.</p>
    <p>Re­quests to the court to re­lease Zhang on bail be­fore the trial and livestream the trial went ig­nored, her lawyer said.</p>
    <p>Other cit­i­zen jour­nal­ists who had dis­ap­peared with­out ex­pla­na­tion in­clude Fang Bin, Chen Qiushi and Li Ze­hua. While there has been no news of Fang, Li re-emerged in a YouTube video in April to say he was be­ing forcibly quar­an­tined. Chen, al­though re­leased, is un­der surveil­lance and has not spo­ken pub­licly, a friend has said.</p>
