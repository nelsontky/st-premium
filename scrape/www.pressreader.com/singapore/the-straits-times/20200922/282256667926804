    <p>OR­LANDO • It was a “spe­cial mo­ment” for An­thony Davis on Sun­day night when he drained a three­p­ointer as time ex­pired, to seal the Los An­ge­les Lak­ers’ 105-103 win over the Den­ver Nuggets for a 2-0 lead in the Na­tional Basketball As­so­ci­a­tion (NBA) West­ern Con­fer­ence Fi­nals.</p>
    <p>But to his coach Frank Vo­gel, the dra­matic buzzer beater was noth­ing new to the Lak­ers.</p>
    <p>“That’s a shot Kobe Bryant would hit,” he said of the team’s Hall of Fame guard who died aged 41 in Jan­uary in a he­li­copter crash.</p>
    <p>“To me, AD com­ing off, just fly­ing to the wing like that, catch-and­shoot with the biggest game on the line of our sea­son, noth­ing but net, it’s a Mamba shot.”</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers were wear­ing their “Black Mamba” jer­seys, co-de­signed by Bryant, and Davis could not be prouder.</p>
    <p>“Spe­cial mo­ment for me, spe­cial mo­ment for the team, es­pe­cially in a sit­u­a­tion like that try­ing to go up 2-0 against a spe­cial team, who are great com­peti­tors and (fought) for the en­tire 48 min­utes,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple talk about (how I’ve) never been in this mo­ment be­fore, pres­sure, am I ready for it? I want to take those shots.</p>
    <p>“So, to do some­thing like in the jer­seys we wore tonight makes it even more spe­cial.”</p>
    <p>He led all scor­ers with 31 points and pulled down nine re­bounds.</p>
    <p>LeBron James had 26 points and 11 re­bounds as the Lak­ers turned back the de­ter­mined Nuggets, who had taken a 103-102 lead on Nikola Jo­kic’s driv­ing bas­ket with 20.8 sec­onds re­main­ing.</p>
    <p>Jo­kic scored 11 straight points for the Nuggets down the stretch, fin­ish­ing with 30 points, six re­bounds and nine as­sists to lead Den­ver.</p>
    <p>Davis and Jo­kic traded bas­kets down the stretch, Jo­kic tip­ping in a miss from Ja­mal Mur­ray to put the Nuggets up 101-100 with 31.8 sec­onds left, only for Davis to an­swer at the other end.</p>
    <p>Af­ter Jo­kic scored to put the Nuggets ahead by one again, the Lak­ers’ Alex Caruso missed a three­p­ointer, and Mur­ray blocked a shot by Danny Green, giv­ing the Lak­ers a chance to in­bound the ball.</p>
    <p>Ra­jon Rondo found Davis, and the All-Star for­ward drained the game-win­ning bas­ket over Jo­kic.</p>
    <p>“We put the ef­fort, we put the fight,” Jo­kic said. “Maybe we lost the game, but I think we played well.</p>
    <p>“Most of the game we were down, but we came back again, so we’re go­ing to keep our heads up and (go) on to the next one.”</p>
    <p>For Davis, the game win­ner was a ca­reer mo­ment for a player who sought a trade from the New Or­leans Pel­i­cans so he would have a chance to chal­lenge for an NBA ti­tle.</p>
    <p>“Spe­cial mo­ment for a spe­cial player,” James re­it­er­ated.</p>
    <p>“It’s not about mak­ing the shot, it’s about hav­ing the be­lief of just tak­ing it, and liv­ing with the re­sult. Tonight was his mo­ment, big-time play.”</p>
    <p>The Lak­ers will try to take a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven se­ries to­day in the NBA’s quar­an­tine bub­ble in Or­lando, Florida.</p>
