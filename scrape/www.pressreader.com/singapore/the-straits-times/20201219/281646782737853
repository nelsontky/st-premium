    <p>NEW JERSEY John­son & John­son said on Thurs­day that it has en­rolled about 45,000 par­tic­i­pants for the first late-stage trial of its Covid-19 sin­gle-dose vac­cine can­di­date and that it ex­pects in­terim data by late next month.</p>
    <p>The com­pany, how­ever, is lag­ging be­hind ri­vals Pfizer and Moderna in the race for a vac­cine to com­bat the Covid-19 pan­demic that has in­fected about 75 mil­lion peo­ple glob­ally.</p>
    <p>J&J’s study, named En­sem­ble, is be­ing con­ducted by its unit Janssen, the drug­maker said in a state­ment.</p>
    <p>While seven coun­tries have al­ready au­tho­rised the emer­gency use of Pfizer and German firm BioNTech’s can­di­dates, Moderna’s ri­val vac­cine was set for reg­u­la­tory au­tho­ri­sa­tion this week in the United States.</p>
    <p>J&J also said it plans to sub­mit an emer­gency use au­tho­ri­sa­tion ap­pli­ca­tion to the US Food and Drug Ad­min­is­tra­tion (FDA) in Fe­bru­ary if the data from the study is safe and ef­fec­tive.</p>
    <p>The com­pany had ear­lier this month an­nounced cuts in en­rol­ment for the vac­cine trial from its orig­i­nal plan for 60,000, as higher rates of Covid-19 in­fec­tions amid a wors­en­ing pan­demic should gen­er­ate the data it needs with fewer study sub­jects.</p>
    <p>The En­sem­ble trial was paused for over a week in Oc­to­ber af­ter a pa­tient de­vel­oped an “un­ex­plained ill­ness” dur­ing the study.</p>
    <p>The com­pany later said it would re­sume the trial af­ter an eval­u­a­tion found no clear cause for the ill­ness.</p>
    <p>A separate late-stage clin­i­cal trial of an in­ves­ti­ga­tional Covid-19 vac­cine can­di­date by Janssen to ex­plore a two-dose reg­i­men was on­go­ing, J&J said.</p>
