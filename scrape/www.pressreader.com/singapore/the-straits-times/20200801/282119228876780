    <p>To­day, you rarely see con­tra­band ci­garette ped­dlers at the usual hot spots in Gey­lang and Sungei Kadut.</p>
    <p>Reg­u­lar en­force­ment mea­sures as well as the out­break of Covid-19 have re­duced face-to-face deal­ings be­tween these street ven­dors and il­le­gal ci­garette buy­ers.</p>
    <p>Still, the prob­lem has not been erad­i­cated as trades have sim­ply gone un­der­ground just like vice and gam­bling. Deals are con­ducted via pri­vate chat groups and so­cial me­dia plat­forms, away from un­wanted at­ten­tion. But such il­licit trades do not es­cape the watch­ful eye of law en­force­ment.</p>
    <p>On Tues­day, three Chi­nese na­tion­als were ar­rested when they had tried to sell part of their loot — 46 car­tons and 42 pack­ets of du­tyun­paid cig­a­rettes in all — to un­der­cover Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms of­fi­cers.</p>
    <p>Cus­toms’ Sup­pres­sion and Com­mu­nity En­gage­ment Branch (SCEB) had mounted two op­er­a­tions that day against ped­dlers who were deal­ing on WeChat, a pop­u­lar Chi­nese mes­sag­ing app. The me­dia was al­lowed to ob­serve the night op­er­a­tions in cen­tral Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>In the first op­er­a­tion, the SCEB had made ear­lier ar­range­ments to buy 20 car­tons of con­tra­band cig­a­rettes from a ped­dler near MacPher­son Lane. One of the lead­ers of the SCEB op­er­a­tion told The Straits Times that un­like street ped­dlers who sell loose pack­ets of cig­a­rettes, on­line ped­dlers pre­fer sell­ing larger quan­ti­ties.</p>
    <p>The of­fi­cer said: “The only way to lure them out is to make a pur­chase. But from ex­pe­ri­ence there’s no guar­an­tee they will show up.”</p>
    <p>That night the ped­dler, who lived at a nearby block, did show up – only to be ar­rested on the spot by plain­clothes Cus­toms of­fi­cers. In a red plas­tic bag, he had 15 ci­garette car­tons wrapped in black tape.</p>
    <p>“The ped­dler we ar­rested told us he kept more cig­a­rettes at home,” said Mr Chua Teck Hui, head of SCEB. “But we found none there.”</p>
    <p>Ini­tial in­ves­ti­ga­tions re­vealed the ped­dler’s co-ten­ant had seen the man get­ting ar­rested and rushed to their flat to get rid of ev­i­dence.</p>
    <p>He threw some cig­a­rettes down the rub­bish chute, and also stashed a bag con­tain­ing 17 car­tons and 14 pack­ets of il­licit cig­a­rettes on the 12th floor of the block.</p>
    <p>In the MacPher­son Lane op­er­a­tion, where 33 car­tons and 32 pack­ets of cig­a­rettes were seized, the to­tal duty and goods and ser­vices tax evaded amounted to $3,320.</p>
    <p>In a sec­ond sting later that night, an­other ped­dler was ar­rested near Jalan Da­mai in Kaki Bukit.</p>
    <p>Twenty-one on­line ped­dlers were caught in the first half of this year; 42 were ar­rested in all, last year.</p>
    <p>Some 2.9 mil­lion pack­ets of con­tra­band cig­a­rettes were seized from on­line sell­ers, street ped­dlers and smug­glers last year – 500,000 pack­ets more than in 2018.</p>
    <p>The num­ber of peo­ple caught buy­ing duty-un­paid cig­a­rettes last year – 6,920 – was also up from the 6,115 the year be­fore. This fig­ure has trended up­wards since 2016, when 5,184 buy­ers were caught for the of­fence.</p>
    <p>“Sin­ga­pore Cus­toms will clamp down hard on any­one who uses so­cial me­dia and mes­sag­ing plat­forms for any duty-un­paid ci­garette ac­tiv­i­ties,” said Mr Chua.</p>
