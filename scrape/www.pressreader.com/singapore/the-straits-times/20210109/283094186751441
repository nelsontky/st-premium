    <p>NEW YORK • The coro­n­avirus pan­demic has felled an­other Broad­way show – Mean Girls.</p>
    <p>The mu­si­cal’s pro­duc­ers, led by Lorne Michaels of Satur­day Night Live, an­nounced on Thurs­day that they would not seek to re­open in New York once the pan­demic eases.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the pro­duc­ers do plan to restart the show’s tour in the United States.</p>
    <p>The show is the fourth Broad­way clos­ing prompted by the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dis­ney an­nounced last year that it would not re­open Frozen, and the pro­duc­ers of two plays that had been in pre­views, play­wright Martin Mc­Don­agh’s Hang­men and a re­vival of late play­wright Ed­ward Albee’s Who’s Afraid Of Vir­ginia Woolf?, de­cided not to wait out the shut­down.</p>
    <p>The Mean Girls clos­ing was prompted by the costs of keep­ing the pro­duc­tion in­tact while the­atres are dark.</p>
    <p>Broad­way has been closed since last March and it seems likely that most shows will not re­turn un­til late this year.</p>
    <p>The mu­si­cal, adapted from a 2004 film star­ring Lind­say Lo­han and Rachel McA­dams, fea­tures a book by ac­tress Tina Fey; mu­sic by com­poser Jeff Rich­mond, who is mar­ried to Fey; lyrics by Nell Ben­jamin; and di­rec­tion by Casey Ni­cholaw.</p>
    <p>It opened in 2018 and was a hit, re­coup­ing its US$17 mil­lion (S$22.5 mil­lion) cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion costs and gross­ing US$124 mil­lion over 834 per­for­mances, ac­cord­ing to the pro­duc­tion.</p>
    <p>But it won none of the 12 Tony Awards for which it was nom­i­nated and its weekly box of­fice had soft­ened over time.</p>
    <p>The Mean Girls’ US tour be­gan in Buf­falo, New York, in 2019, and a Lon­don pro­duc­tion, which was in the works be­fore the pan­demic, is still planned, ac­cord­ing to Michaels.</p>
    <p>Para­mount Pic­tures an­nounced last Jan­uary that it would make a film ver­sion of the stage mu­si­cal, pro­duced by Michaels and Fey.</p>
