    <p>De­mand for man­power in the “re­ces­sion-proof” health­care sec­tor will con­tinue to grow in the com­ing years, said Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing.</p>
    <p>This is due to chang­ing de­mo­graph­ics, such as an age­ing pop­u­la­tion, and as­pi­ra­tions for bet­ter qual­ity health­care, he said at a vir­tual me­dia con­fer­ence yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing after a visit to the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Alice Lee Cen­tre for Nurs­ing Stud­ies, Mr Chan noted that ef­forts will be made to al­le­vi­ate bot­tle­necks in the train­ing of health­care work­ers.</p>
    <p>“We are com­mit­ted to pro­vide as many places as needed, so long as we can find peo­ple who have the de­sire, the pas­sion and the qual­i­ties to join this sec­tor,” he added.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s health­care sec­tor is sup­ported by a work­force of more than 100,000 peo­ple across both pub­lic and pri­vate sec­tors.</p>
    <p>But in the fu­ture, an age­ing pop­u­la­tion and ris­ing chronic dis­ease in­ci­dence will drive de­mand for man­power. New fa­cil­i­ties, such as in­te­grated fa­cil­i­ties, gen­eral hos­pi­tals, com­mu­nity hos­pi­tals and poly­clin­ics, will also be de­vel­oped.</p>
    <p>A three-pronged ap­proach is be­ing taken to help Sin­ga­pore­ans en­ter the health­care sec­tor and thrive in their ca­reers.</p>
    <p>One way is through pre­par­ing young Sin­ga­pore­ans for ca­reers in health­care. The Gov­ern­ment has been work­ing with in­sti­tutes of higher learn­ing to build a pipe­line of pro­fes­sion­als. For in­stance, lo­cal nurs­ing in­take rose from 1,500 in 2014 to 2,200 last year – an in­crease of about 50 per cent.</p>
    <p>New un­der­grad­u­ate al­lied health pro­grammes such as di­etet­ics and nu­tri­tion, and speech and lan­guage ther­apy, were in­tro­duced in re­cent years.</p>
    <p>Another ap­proach in­volves help­ing fresh grad­u­ates and mid­ca­reer job seek­ers with­out the rel­e­vant back­grounds to en­ter the sec­tor.</p>
    <p>Ini­tia­tives are in place to do so, such as ca­reer con­ver­sion pro­grammes and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties. This comes amid ris­ing in­ter­est among work­ers to switch to the sec­tor dur­ing the pan­demic. For in­stance, there were three times more ap­pli­ca­tions for the Oc­to­ber in­take of the pro­fes­sional con­ver­sion pro­gramme for reg­is­tered nurses (diploma) than the in­take back in April, said the Man­power Min­istry.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment plans to cre­ate a 900-place train­ing ca­pac­ity over the next three years to cater to mid-ca­reer switch­ers en­ter­ing nurs­ing and al­lied health roles. But this may be ad­justed de­pend­ing on the in­ter­est and par­tic­i­pa­tion rate.</p>
    <p>Mr Chan said the few years of foun­da­tion train­ing needed for some of the health­care roles should not be seen as an ob­sta­cle but an in­vest­ment, adding that many in the pro­fes­sion have stayed on and con­trib­uted for many years.</p>
    <p>“This is a re­ces­sion-proof pro­fes­sion be­cause in good times and bad times, health­care is im­por­tant to all of us,” he added.</p>
    <p>Ex­ist­ing work­ers will also be given con­tin­u­ous train­ing and devel­op­ment op­por­tu­ni­ties. These in­clude train­ing grants for pro­fes­sion­als to take on skills at­tach­ment or for­mal post­grad­u­ate ed­u­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Se­nior Min­is­ter of State for Health Koh Poh Koon, who was at the press con­fer­ence, urged Sin­ga­pore­ans to con­sider a health­care ca­reer.</p>
    <p>“Health­care is a sec­tor in which no two days are the same,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Every pa­tient brings dif­fer­ent chal­lenges. At the same time, it also brings the sat­is­fac­tion of you hav­ing made a dif­fer­ence in the lives of a per­son or a fam­ily.”</p>
