    <p>Ad­ver­sity sparks creativity. Lo­cal and overseas de­sign­ers are draw­ing in­spi­ra­tion from Covid-19 to cre­ate nifty gadgets to keep the virus at arm’s length.</p>
    <p>A search on­line throws up, among other items, colour­ful desk­top di­viders from Mel­bourne, plasma air pu­ri­fiers from Dublin and portable air clean­ers from South Korea.</p>
    <p>One Sin­ga­pore de­sign firm has even re­leased a se­ries of in­tel­lec­tual property-free de­sign tem­plates and ideas rang­ing from phone sani­tis­ers to splat­ter shields to help fight Covid-19.</p>
    <p>Mel­bourne-based de­signer Za­hava Elen­berg adds colour to so­cial dis­tanc­ing with her new range of desk­top par­ti­tions, or sneeze guards, called ClikClax.</p>
    <p>Mod­u­lar per­spex pieces that can be as­sem­bled to cre­ate desk­top par­ti­tions for home of­fices, hot-de­sk­ing spa­ces and com­mu­nal din­ing ar­eas, they were de­signed to curb the spread of harm­ful air­borne droplets.</p>
    <p>ClikClax’s ri­otous hues of neon orange, yel­low and red hark back to the cult tod­dler toys of in­ter­lock­ing squares called PlayPlax, de­signed by Bri­tish chil­dren’s toy de­signer Pa­trick Ry­lands in the 1960s.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Pa­trick Chia of the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s (NUS) Divi­sion of In­dus­trial De­sign says: “I would say the Clik</p>
    <p>Clax par­ti­tion sys­tem could work in some Covid-19 sce­nar­ios such as re­tail.”</p>
    <p>Can Covid-19 prod­ucts also be play­ful?</p>
    <p>“Yes, why not?” says the 51-yearold prod­uct de­sign pi­o­neer who won the Pres­i­dent’s De­sign Award in 2013.</p>
    <p>“It’s just that we don’t see much of this prob­a­bly be­cause the pan­demic is still quite new to us and most so­lu­tions are solv­ing more im­me­di­ate and prag­matic needs.”</p>
    <p>One com­pany that is bank­ing on prag­ma­tism is home-grown firm Wah Ye Ad­ver­tis­ing.</p>
    <p>The events man­age­ment out­fit, which cre­ates props for the ex­hi­bi­tion and events in­dus­try, worked dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker to cre­ate desk­top par­ti­tions with a dif­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>Wah Ye’s Sin­ga­pore team came up with a de­sign that, in­stead of so­cial dis­tanc­ing, brings peo­ple together but safely.</p>
    <p>Its trans­par­ent acrylic desk­top sep­a­ra­tors are al­most in­vis­i­ble, save for fine out­lines that catch the light. This al­lows front of­fice staff such as cus­tomer ser­vice and mar­ket­ing sales ex­ec­u­tives to in­ter­act and en­gage with the public with­out the fear of cross-con­tam­i­na­tion from harm­ful air­borne droplets through talk­ing, cough­ing or sneez­ing.</p>
    <p>The di­viders were ex­actly what Mr Pa­trick Keng’s of­fice needed.</p>
    <p>The hu­man re­sources man­ager at a lo­cal whole­sale trad­ing firm bought the acrylic di­viders from Wah Ye for 30 work­sta­tions in his com­pany be­cause it was the per­fect fit for his HR staff.</p>
    <p>“I spent about $3,000 on di­viders of dif­fer­ent shapes and sizes,” says Mr Keng, 45. “Our staff deal with em­ploy­ees face-to-face. The clear acrylic desk­top di­viders not only al­low for so­cial in­ter­ac­tion, but also en­sure some mea­sure of safe dis­tanc­ing.”</p>
    <p>Not all Covid-19 prod­uct de­signs are cre­ated to be mon­e­tised.</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore de­sign firm Stuck De­sign re­leased a range of free down­load­able de­signs be­tween April and this month for med­i­cal front-lin­ers as it felt a “moral obli­ga­tion” to do its part to “chip away at the pan­demic chal­lenge”, says Mr Donn Koh, Stuck’s co-founder and de­sign prin­ci­pal.</p>
    <p>“As de­sign in­no­va­tors, we know our skill sets are use­ful for many of these ex­per­i­ments, so we wanted to re­spond re­spon­si­bly,” says Mr Koh, 38, who is also a se­nior lec­turer at the NUS Divi­sion of In­dus­trial De­sign.</p>
    <p>He worked with a team of more than 20 de­sign­ers and col­lab­o­ra­tors to re­lease six free de­signs on­line for med­i­cal per­son­nel around the world to pro­tect them­selves against Covid-19.</p>
    <p>The prod­ucts in­clude “Stay Home” door han­dle hang­ers which “nudge” re­spon­si­ble be­haviour, splat­ter shields for front-line staff per­form­ing pro­ce­dures on pa­tients, and ul­travi­o­let (UV) mask ster­ilis­ers.</p>
    <p>The firm this week com­pleted the de­sign of a new UV phone sani­tiser and will re­lease it un­der the Mat­terClean brand in the next few months.</p>
    <p>“Dur­ing a cri­sis, de­sign­ers solve prob­lems by bring­ing in broader and un­ex­pected sources of in­spi­ra­tion. This is help­ful and of­fers new pos­si­bil­i­ties in sit­u­a­tions where the typ­i­cal so­lu­tions seem fu­tile,” he says.</p>
