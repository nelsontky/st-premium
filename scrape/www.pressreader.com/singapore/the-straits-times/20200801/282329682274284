    <p>Af­ter be­ing stuck in his Jo­hor Baru home for about five months, Malaysian ap­pren­tice jockey Iskandar Ros­man will be back rid­ing at Kranji to­mor­row.</p>
    <p>He has picked up two rides – River Ruby for trainer Mok Zhan Lun in Race 6 and Dont­look­downonme for trainer David Kok in Race 8.</p>
    <p>The 25-year-old and com­pa­tri­ots Wong Chin Chuen and Mohd Zaki were “stranded” in their JB base af­ter the Cause­way was closed be­cause of the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>But the trio have been given the green light to ride with the re­cent eas­ing of cer­tain re­stric­tions of the cir­cuit breaker.</p>
    <p>Iskandar, who is in­den­tured to trainer Lee Freed­man, left his wife Aina and one-year-old son Noah be­hind on July 14 to serve a two-week of quar­an­tine in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>He then passed the manda­tory Covid-19 test and re­turned to ride track­work on Wed­nes­day.</p>
    <p>Wong and Zaki will en­ter Sin­ga­pore early next week to serve the quar­an­tine and un­dergo the Covid-19 test af­ter that.</p>
    <p>“I’m so happy to be back. It was a very long time not rid­ing – al­most five months,” said Iskandar, who was serv­ing two care­less rid­ing sus­pen­sions amount­ing to about six weeks (March 8 to April 17), be­fore Sin­ga­pore rac­ing was sus­pended on April 7.</p>
    <p>“I went back to JB be­cause I was sus­pended then. Then rac­ing stopped, and since I couldn’t work, I had to go back to my wife and my lit­tle boy. I missed rid­ing so much. I would watch the race re­plays on the web­site and wish I were there.”</p>
    <p>He felt very frus­trated, es­pe­cially when rac­ing re­sumed on July 11.</p>
    <p>But, luck­ily, his wife just opened a shop sell­ing cook­ies to tide them through.</p>
    <p>“But, when the boss told me I fi­nally got the per­mis­sion to go back, I had to leave my fam­ily, even if I know I will miss them so much.</p>
    <p>“My wife said never mind, she sup­ported me. My son was born pre­ma­ture and needs reg­u­lar med­i­cal check-ups. But I have many fam­ily mem­bers who can help us even if I’m not around.”</p>
    <p>Iskandar has notched two wins and four sec­onds from 35 rides at Kranji this year.</p>
