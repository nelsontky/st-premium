    <p>NEW YORK • Karolina Pliskova and Sofia Kenin are the top two seeds at the US Open start­ing next Mon­day, but with so lit­tle com­pet­i­tive ten­nis un­der their belt, it is likely to be a far more open field at Flush­ing Mead­ows.</p>
    <p>Be­fore Sun­day, Pliskova had not played on the WTA Tour since Qatar in Fe­bru­ary, while Kenin was last on the court in March, cap­tur­ing the Lyon ti­tle.</p>
    <p>The women’s cir­cuit only recom­menced ear­lier this month af­ter a five-month coro­n­avirus-en­forced hia­tus and the match rusti­ness was ev­i­dent as the Western & South­ern Open lost its top seeds in the sec­ond round.</p>
    <p>Czech world No. 3 Pliskova, who had a first-round bye, slammed down 11 aces but also com­mit­ted nine dou­ble faults in a 7-5, 6-4 de­feat by Rus­sia’s Veronika Ku­d­er­me­tova.</p>
    <p>Aus­tralian Open cham­pion Kenin also strug­gled to get go­ing af­ter the long lay­off, los­ing 6-1, 7-6 (9-7) to France’s Al­ize Cor­net.</p>
    <p>“It didn’t feel like I had any rhythm,” said the fourth-ranked Amer­i­can. “I don’t know why I let that hap­pen.</p>
    <p>“I lit­er­ally couldn’t feel the ball, like lit­er­ally two sets. I don’t even know how I came back, to be hon­est. It was re­ally frus­trat­ing.”</p>
    <p>They were not the only big names to de­part the hard-court event – the last one be­fore the US Open – early.</p>
    <p>Mar­keta Von­drousova con­tin­ued her run of poor form as the Czech 10th seed lost 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-4 to Ger­man qual­i­fier Laura Siege­mund in their first-round clash.</p>
    <p>Last year’s French Open fi­nal­ist, who also lost in her opener at the Tour’s restart in Palermo, was up a break 4-2 in the third and look­ing set for vic­tory un­til her op­po­nent swept the last four games.</p>
    <p>In the men’s draw, Greek fourth seed Ste­fanos Tsit­si­pas eased to a 6-1, 6-3 sec­ond-round win over Kevin An­der­son of South Africa in 69 min­utes, while Bel­gian sev­enth seed David Gof­fin sailed past Croa­tia’s Borna Coric 7-6 (8-6), 6-4 into the third round.</p>
