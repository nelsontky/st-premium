    <p>KUALA LUMPUR • A Malaysian court will hand down its ver­dict in Na­jib Razak’s first cor­rup­tion trial to­mor­row, nearly 16 months af­ter it be­gan prob­ing the former prime min­is­ter’s role in the multi­bil­lion­dol­lar 1MDB scan­dal.</p>
    <p>Na­jib and his in­ner cir­cle are ac­cused of plun­der­ing sov­er­eign wealth fund 1Malaysia De­vel­op­ment Ber­had (1MDB) in a mind-bog­gling fraud that stretched around the world.</p>
    <p>Stolen cash was al­legedly used to bankroll Hol­ly­wood hit The Wolf Of Wall Street, star­ring Leonardo Di­Caprio, and US in­vest­ment ti­tan Gold­man Sachs also be­came em­broiled in the scan­dal.</p>
    <p>Anger at the loot­ing played a large part in the shock loss by Na­jib’s Barisan Na­sional coali­tion in an elec­tion two years ago af­ter six decades in power. He was sub­se­quently ar­rested and hit with dozens of charges over the fraud.</p>
    <p>Na­jib is cur­rently fac­ing three sep­a­rate 1MDB-linked tri­als, and the first fi­nally reaches its cli­max this week in the Kuala Lumpur High Court.</p>
    <p>The case cen­tres on the trans­fer of RM42 mil­lion (S$13.7 mil­lion) from former 1MDB unit SRC In­ter­na­tional into Na­jib’s bank ac­counts.</p>
    <p>He de­nies any wrong­do­ing, and his lawyer, Mr Muham­mad Shafee Ab­dul­lah, told Agence FrancePres­se ahead of the ver­dict: “I feel good about the defence.”</p>
    <p>The former prime min­is­ter, who is fac­ing four charges of cor­rup­tion and three of money laun­der­ing in the case, in­sists he was ig­no­rant of the bank trans­fers.</p>
    <p>His defence team has por­trayed him as a vic­tim and in­stead sought to paint fi­nancier Low Taek Jho, a key fig­ure in the scan­dal who has been charged in the United States and Malaysia, as the mas­ter­mind.</p>
    <p>Low, whose where­abouts are un­known, main­tains his in­no­cence.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors in­sist that Na­jib was in con­trol of the 1MDB unit and that they have a solid case, but ob­servers be­lieve re­cent po­lit­i­cal up­heaval in Malaysia could af­fect the out­come of the trial, which be­gan in April last year.</p>
    <p>Na­jib’s scan­dal-mired party re­turned to power in March as part of a coali­tion af­ter a re­formist ad­min­is­tra­tion col­lapsed.</p>
    <p>Since then, 1MDB-linked charges were un­ex­pect­edly dropped against the former leader’s step­son Riza Aziz, one of The Wolf Of Wall Street’s pro­duc­ers, in ex­change for him agree­ing to re­turn as­sets to Malaysia.</p>
    <p>Pros­e­cu­tors also dropped dozens of charges against Na­jib’s ally Musa Aman, the former leader of Sabah state.</p>
    <p>If Na­jib – cur­rently free on bail – is con­victed to­mor­row, he could be sen­tenced the same day.</p>
    <p>Each charge of cor­rup­tion car­ries a max­i­mum jail term of 20 years, and each money laun­der­ing count is pun­ish­able by a term of up to 15 years.</p>
    <p>But the 67-year-old is likely to ap­peal against any con­vic­tion, and may not be jailed straight away.</p>
    <p>If he is found guilty and the con­vic­tion is up­held, he would also be barred from po­lit­i­cal of­fice for sev­eral years.</p>
    <p>Ms Bridget Welsh, a Malaysia expert from the Univer­sity of Not­ting­ham, said a con­vic­tion would be viewed pos­i­tively by many for bring­ing “some ac­count­abil­ity on the scan­dal of 1MDB”.</p>
    <p>By con­trast, an ac­quit­tal “will do se­ri­ous dam­age to Malaysia’s in­ter­na­tional rep­u­ta­tion”, she added.</p>
    <p>The au­thor­i­ties in sev­eral coun­tries are in­ves­ti­gat­ing the 1MDB theft, which funded a global spend­ing spree that in­cluded the pur­chase of high-end real es­tate, art­works and a su­pery­acht.</p>
    <p>The amounts in­volved in Na­jib’s first case are small com­pared with those in his sec­ond and most sig­nif­i­cant trial, which cen­tres on al­le­ga­tions that he il­lic­itly ob­tained over US$500 mil­lion (S$691 mil­lion).</p>
