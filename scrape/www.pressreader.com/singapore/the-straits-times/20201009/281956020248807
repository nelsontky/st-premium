    <p>The lat­est jobs sit­u­a­tion report re­leased on Wed­nes­day is sober­ing, but also of­fers glim­mers of hope that the labour mar­ket is on the mend. The dis­ap­point­ing news is that the res­i­dent un­em­ploy­ment rate rose to 4.5 per cent in Au­gust, a level 0.4 per­cent­age points higher than in July, and the high­est since the peak of the global fi­nan­cial cri­sis in Septem­ber 2009. Some economists be­lieve that un­em­ploy­ment has not yet topped out, and this can­not be ruled out. How­ever, the eco­nomic con­trac­tion is likely to have bottomed out in the sec­ond quar­ter when the cir­cuit breaker was in force. As un­em­ploy­ment is a lag­ging in­di­ca­tor, there is a good chance that job cre­ation will pick up dur­ing the fourth quar­ter, es­pe­cially af­ter a fur­ther eas­ing of Covid-19 curbs ahead of and dur­ing the next phase of the econ­omy’s open­ing up. This will es­pe­cially ben­e­fit parts of the ser­vice sec­tor, which have been among the worst hit. The wage sub­si­dies un­der the Jobs Growth In­cen­tive, which started last month, should also help cre­ate more jobs.</p>
    <p>But job cre­ation aside, one of the big chal­lenges in the short term will be job match­ing. The Min­istry of Man­power re­ported that by the end of Au­gust, some 117,000 new work op­por­tu­ni­ties were cre­ated un­der the SG United Jobs and Skills Pack­age, which ex­ceeded the 100,000 tar­get. How­ever, the ac­tual place­ments to­talled just over 33,000, which means more than two-thirds of new po­si­tions re­main va­cant. Job match­ing was never go­ing to be easy. The scope of jobs cre­ated, whether with gov­ern­ment sub­si­dies or not, was al­ways likely to be in eco­nomic sec­tors (tech­nol­ogy, fi­nance, med­i­cal) dif­fer­ent from those where jobs were lost, such as avi­a­tion, en­ter­tain­ment and hos­pi­tal­ity.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has made the con­struc­tive sug­ges­tion that em­ploy­ers should be flex­i­ble and look be­yond can­di­dates with back­grounds that ex­actly fit avail­able jobs. But many em­ploy­ers are likely to start out by look­ing for can­di­dates whose qual­i­fi­ca­tions and ex­pe­ri­ence closely match their job va­can­cies. Only af­ter they fail to find such can­di­dates will they ad­just their hir­ing prac­tices, and there may need to be more train­ing pro­vided. Sim­i­larly, job seek­ers will, in the first in­stance, look for po­si­tions for which they feel they are best qual­i­fied. Look­ing fur­ther afield will be a sec­ond choice. Ca­reer coun­selling and match­ing ser­vices can speed up the process, but fill­ing va­can­cies will take time. Look­ing ahead, it is ap­pro­pri­ate that the Gov­ern­ment plans to fo­cus on struc­tural changes that the econ­omy will need over the next five to 10 years, such as boost­ing Sin­ga­pore’s role as a re­gional hub, ac­cel­er­at­ing dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion and up­grad­ing skills, as well as build­ing a more in­clu­sive, re­silient and green econ­omy. These will be im­por­tant sources of com­par­a­tive advantage for Sin­ga­pore long af­ter the pan­demic has passed.</p>
