    <p>Ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, 5G and cy­ber se­cu­rity will be the key driv­ers in grow­ing Sin­ga­pore’s dig­i­tal econ­omy in a post-Covid-19 world.</p>
    <p>Out­lin­ing the coun­try’s re­search plans to 2025, the Na­tional Re­search Foun­da­tion (NRF) said yes­ter­day that new op­por­tu­ni­ties ex­ist at the in­ter­sec­tion of AI, 5G and cy­ber se­cu­rity, and in dig­i­tal tools that en­gen­der trust in ar­eas such as food, medicine and vac­cine prove­nance.</p>
    <p>At a vir­tual press con­fer­ence an­nounc­ing Sin­ga­pore’s seventh Re­search, In­no­va­tion and En­ter­prise (RIE) plan, Deputy Prime Min­is­ter Heng Swee Keat noted that the pan­demic has in­creased the im­pe­tus to in­no­vate and dig­i­talise.</p>
    <p>“We must con­tinue to max­imise the value cre­ated by dig­i­tal in­no­va­tion, and bet­ter in­te­grate tech­nol­ogy and gov­er­nance,” added Mr Heng, who is also Fi­nance Min­is­ter and chairs the NRF.</p>
    <p>One key area, as out­lined in the RIE 2025, is AIen­abled cy­ber-se­cu­rity tools, as they are more ca­pa­ble than hu­man be­ings in sniff­ing out se­cu­rity threats in crit­i­cal in­fra­struc­ture.</p>
    <p>AI-en­abled cy­ber se­cu­rity is key if 5G net­works are to form the back­bone of Sin­ga­pore’s dig­i­tal econ­omy, with the net­work po­ten­tially sup­port­ing mis­sion­crit­i­cal ap­pli­ca­tions such as driverless car nav­i­ga­tion and re­mote surgery.</p>
    <p>Min­is­ter-in-charge of Cy­ber Se­cu­rity S. Iswaran said: “The new value is in the in­ter­sti­tials and the points of in­ter­sec­tion.”</p>
    <p>“All of th­ese (tech­nolo­gies) will un­der­gird the next bound of eco­nomic growth... th­ese tech­nolo­gies can catal­yse par­a­digm-shift­ing ap­pli­ca­tions,” Mr Iswaran, who is also Min­is­ter for Com­mu­ni­ca­tions and In­for­ma­tion, added at the vir­tual press con­fer­ence.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, AI and 5G can trans­form man­u­fac­tur­ing, health­care and trans­porta­tion via smart fac­to­ries, telemedici­ne and au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles, re­spec­tively, he said. AI also pow­ers highly au­to­mated smart fac­to­ries, where the fu­ture of man­u­fac­tur­ing lies. An emerg­ing area Sin­ga­pore is eye­ing is elec­tric and au­ton­o­mous ve­hi­cles.</p>
    <p>Trade and In­dus­try Min­is­ter Chan Chun Sing said: “I am quite sure we have no com­pet­i­tive ad­van­tage in pro­duc­ing cer­tain parts of the cars like the wind­screen and the tyre.”</p>
    <p>“We want to fo­cus on the high-value parts in the car man­u­fac­tur­ing process that in­cludes com­pu­ta­tional (and) nav­i­ga­tion sys­tems, and in­te­grate them into a prod­uct that is of value to the mar­ket.”</p>
    <p>In this way, Sin­ga­pore will not be eas­ily over­taken by play­ers that of­fer cheaper pro­duc­tion, he added.</p>
    <p>A por­tion of the re­search plan’s $25 bil­lion fund­ing will go to­wards ex­panded mis­sions. Th­ese in­clude:</p>
    <p>AI sys­tems to im­prove de­ci­sion-mak­ing at air and sea ports. Con­trol sys­tems with AI sen­sors can de­tect if air­craft have va­cated a run­way even in poor vis­i­bil­ity and bet­ter direct ground traf­fic;</p>
    <p>• Quan­tum com­put­ing tech­niques to en­hance cryp­tog­ra­phy meth­ods in cy­ber se­cu­rity to bet­ter safe­guard 5G ap­pli­ca­tions and con­nec­tiv­ity be­tween data cen­tres; and</p>
    <p>• Blockchain tech­nolo­gies to au­then­ti­cate the prove­nance of food, medicine and vac­cines. A blockchain is a de­cen­tralised dig­i­tal data­base that en­sures au­then­tic­ity and trans­parency in record keep­ing.</p>
    <p>DPM Heng also re­it­er­ated Sin­ga­pore’s con­tin­ued fo­cus on ba­sic re­search in fields such as quan­tum com­put­ing.</p>
    <p>It is known that quan­tum com­put­ing can be highly ben­e­fi­cial to sci­en­tific de­vel­op­ments due to the new and faster way of pro­cess­ing in­for­ma­tion. For ex­am­ple, the Cen­tre for Quan­tum Tech­nolo­gies at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore is work­ing with ST En­gi­neer­ing to de­velop new cy­ber-se­cu­rity tools which pro­duce en­cryp­tion codes that are un­break­able.</p>
    <p>One-third of RIE 2025’s $25 bil­lion fund­ing will go to­wards ba­sic re­search.</p>
