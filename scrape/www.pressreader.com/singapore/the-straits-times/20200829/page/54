Your energy is terrific for moving out from your home base. This is likelier to involve travel than anything permanent. Gemini (May 21 - June 20)
You are not having an easy time unless you are on your own.
Make sure you do not have to rely on anyone understand­ing you. Cancer (June 21 - July 22)
Your heightened awareness is making life interestin­g. See if you can get a better sense of what people are looking for. Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)
Try your best to show your bright side – it is easier than you think. You may also find that you can get others to see the good in things. Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)
It is a great day for romantic adventures, even if you are stuck at work. You are twice as hot when you are working or working it. Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)
You are feeling a bit stressed out over a domestic situation, but try not to give it more power.
You cannot ignore it, of course. Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)
The day is all about work, so even if you are unemployed, you should devote time to advancing your commercial interests. Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21) Do not worry too much about your spiritual or other needs for the moment – that stuff can sort itself out later. Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19) Someone close to you is impressed by something you say or do.
It is a good time to build up this relationsh­ip. Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18) Most of the cool stuff is going on beneath the level of awareness. Try to make sure you are taking things slow and soaking it all in. C: Children; CA: Current Affairs;
