Please e-mail your letter to stforum@sph.com.sg WRITE IN: Compel e-scooter rider to pay damages with future earnings I read with concern that a man who caused a female pedestrian to suffer severe brain injuries in an e-scooter accident is not paying the court-ordered damages of $445,000 (Tough fight for family to get compensati­on from PMD rider, Aug 2).
The reasons given were that the man has no assets and was not covered by insurance.
The victim, as a result of the accident, has lost considerab­le quality of life and will require financial resources for her upkeep.
The man responsibl­e for the injuries should be made, by law, to pay the damages with his future earnings, perhaps in instalment­s, if he is capable of making money in the future.
This is indeed just compensati­on for the victim who has a future of need, if the man has a future of earnings. Quah Boon Long E-scooter rider should make some effort to compensate accident victim make any effort at compensati­on for causing grievous injury to another person by his own negligent act.
At 21 years old, Mr Ting is already an adult. He is old enough to secure a job and start paying monthly instalment­s to Mr Leong.
He can and should also enlist the help of his family to settle his debt. Only by being held accountabl­e will he learn to take responsibi­lity for his future actions. I read with admiration about the many selfless and kind Singaporea­ns who have come forward to help Mr Leong Loon Wah pay for his wife’s medical expenses (Crowdfundi­ng drive launched for victim of e-scooter accident, Aug 15).
But it appears that Mr Nicholas Ting Nai Jie, the e-scooter rider who crashed into Mr Leong’s wife in 2016, has made no effort to compensate his victim’s family.
Should he be let off the hook just because he declared that he has no income? If so, what would be the message to young Singaporea­ns if they perceive that one need not OnFacebook So long as everything works with online or mobile banking, customer service is not necessary. Should something be not available or if there is a disruption, banks should respond immediatel­y and communicat­e to avoid anxiety or frustratio­n. As banks automate and go digital, has customer service suffered? Julie Chooi Kok Woon Be it banks or telcos, if we have a problem, we still prefer to talk to a person rather than a machine. Most cyclists look out for pedestrian­s pedestrian­s to pass regardless of whether the area is crowded or not. And we ring the bell to signal to the pedestrian­s that we are behind them.
When pedestrian­s are not observant, or are distracted by their smartphone­s, it is unfair to put the blame solely on cyclists.
Pedestrian­s should take some responsibi­lity by keeping to the left and not occupying the whole path. Siti Nor’aini A S Adrian Djong I changed my ATM card in less than five minutes at the POSB Tiong Bahru branch three weeks ago. I was surprised that this could be done via the ATM. Technology makes it possible – kudos to DBS/POSB in taking the lead. My daily observatio­ns tell me that cyclists prefer to ride on roads or on designated cycling paths such as the Park Connector Network (PCN) (Tough code of conduct needed for cyclists, by Mr Lawrence Loh Kiah Muan; and Pedestrian­s, cyclists sharing paths will lead to accidents, by Mr Lim Kock Lian, both Aug 13). They would usually pick cycling routes with the least pedestrian traffic to get to their destinatio­n. But in some cases, cyclists may have no choice but to go onto footpaths. It all depends on the traffic conditions, and also the rider’s confidence on the roads.
But one obstacle for cyclists is that even when separate paths are demarcated on the PCN, some pedestrian­s tend to ignore the markings and walk on the cycling paths.
From my own experience, as well as from what I have observed of other cyclists, we would definitely slow down and wait for Talking to a machine or using Internet banking is never easier than talking to a human being who could solve our problems within five minutes. James Fong How can we reduce the incidence of violence against women? Syed Ali Hng Jing Yuan You need to wait very long on the phone listening to automated messages before you can talk to a customer service officer. Path safety a shared responsibi­lity The very definition of violence against women should be expanded. Coercive control, emotional abuse and gaslightin­g – all are violence against women. Believing the victim and ensuring her safety is important. Malah Suppiah We thank Mr Ramamurthy Mahesh Kumar (Penalties the only way to harmony on shared paths, Aug 17) as well as Mr Lawrence Loh Kiah Muan and Mr Lim Kock Lian (Tough code of conduct needed for cyclists; and Pedestrian­s, cyclists sharing paths will lead to accidents, both Aug 13) for their feedback.
We have heard diverse views from both pedestrian­s and active mobility device users. Some have encountere­d inconsider­ate device users who do not dismount in crowded spaces, while others have seen pedestrian­s who continue to use their mobile devices and refuse to give way.
When the Code of Conduct for Active Mobility Device Users was introduced in 2018, we establishe­d 12 guidelines for cyclists and riders to ride in a safe and considerat­e manner on public paths.
For example, those on active mobility devices, being the faster ones on a path, should always give way to pedestrian­s – and slow down or dismount in crowded places.
We have now added four simple safety tips for pedestrian­s. In doing so, the code of conduct now applies to all path users, setting out behavioura­l norms for greater path safety.
It rests on one basic principle: Everyone has a part to play and should look out for one another to stay safe in these common public spaces.
In tandem with promoting gracious path-sharing behaviour, we will continue to expand our active mobility infrastruc­ture to improve connectivi­ty for device users and better safety for pedestrian­s.
Where there are cycling paths parallel to footpaths, active mobility device users should use them. However, there is just not enough space in Singapore for us to build distinct paths for every different user.
The Land Transport Authority will press on with active enforcemen­t of regulation­s as well as public education. Active mobility device users who flout the rules will face stiff penalties.
The safety of all path users is paramount as we continue to promote active mobility in Singapore.
Overall path safety has improved significan­tly, with active mobility accidents on public paths dropping by about half over the past year.
We can do even better together, as we build a culture of responsibi­lity and graciousne­ss, for safer paths and more enjoyable journeys. It has become more convenient for me. Saves me trips to the bank and I don’t have to worry about its operating hours. Vidya Gunashagra­n Liaw Sze Keong Make sure the offender is punished and not let off lightly. Press 1, press 2, press 3... the choices are not even audible sometimes. After a while, I get a bit dazed and confused. Not senior citizen-friendly. Can we have an option to speak to a customer service officer at the very first step? Tessa Koh Education has to start at home. It has to start with mothers teaching their children – boys to respect women and girls to set boundaries.
