    <p>In Bi­har, In­dia’s third most pop­u­lous state, prepa­ra­tions have started for hold­ing state assem­bly elec­tions in which Covid-19 pa­tients will also be able to vote.</p>
    <p>The eastern state has more than 8.7 mil­lion vot­ers, which poses a con­sid­er­able chal­lenge to hold­ing safe and fair elec­tions while coro­n­avirus in­fec­tions con­tinue to climb in the coun­try. In­dia has more than 3.54 mil­lion cases, of which Bi­har has around 130,000.</p>
    <p>The elec­tion com­mis­sion, which is un­der­stood to have fac­tored in how coun­tries such as Sin­ga­pore and South Korea had held elec­tions, has come up with guide­lines rang­ing from al­low­ing only five peo­ple, in­clud­ing the can­di­date, to go doorto-door cam­paign­ing, to pro­vid­ing gloves to vot­ers as well as fa­cil­i­ties for wash­ing hands and hand sani­tis­ers at ev­ery polling booth.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court last Friday said the coro­n­avirus cri­sis “can­not be a ground” for stop­ping elec­tions. The court de­clined to take up a pe­ti­tion seek­ing to stop them.</p>
    <p>Each polling sta­tion will have a max­i­mum of 1,000 vot­ers, in­stead of 1,500, and vot­ers will have to briefly re­move their masks for iden­ti­fi­ca­tion.</p>
    <p>Covid-19 pa­tients who are quar­an­tined will be al­lowed to cast their vote in the last hour of the polling day un­der the su­per­vi­sion of the health au­thor­i­ties, fol­low­ing pre­ven­tive mea­sures strictly, ac­cord­ing to the guide­lines.</p>
    <p>Of­fi­cials said the first stage of prepa­ra­tions in­cludes check­ing the elec­tronic vot­ing ma­chines and pro­vid­ing train­ing for its staff for the elec­tions, which will be held ei­ther in Oc­to­ber or Novem­ber, to pick all 243 seats in the state assem­bly.</p>
    <p>An elec­tion com­mis­sion of­fi­cial who did not want to be named said: “The re­cov­ery rate is 80 per cent (com­pared to the na­tional av­er­age of 76 per cent). If this rate keeps go­ing up, it will be good. Re­turn­ing of­fi­cers are get­ting train­ing in</p>
    <p>The elec­tion com­mis­sion, which is un­der­stood to have fac­tored in how coun­tries such as Sin­ga­pore and South Korea had held elec­tions, has come up with guide­lines rang­ing from al­low­ing only five peo­ple, in­clud­ing the can­di­date, to go door-to-door cam­paign­ing, to pro­vid­ing gloves to vot­ers as well as fa­cil­i­ties for wash­ing hands and hand sani­tis­ers at ev­ery polling booth.</p>
    <p>how to con­duct them­selves dur­ing this pan­demic.”</p>
    <p>The state saw cases start to climb when hun­dreds of thou­sands of mi­grant work­ers re­turned from dif­fer­ent parts of the coun­try af­ter a strin­gent lock­down was lifted in May. It is also cur­rently fac­ing flood­ing in the state, an an­nual event brought on by mon­soon rains which has af­fected more than 500,000 peo­ple.</p>
    <p>Bi­har, with a pop­u­la­tion of 99 mil­lion, is one of In­dia’s poor­est states. Its Chief Min­is­ter, Mr Ni­tish Ku­mar, is the leader of the Janata Dal (United) or JDU, which is in a rul­ing al­liance with Prime Min­is­ter Naren­dra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p>
    <p>The main op­po­si­tion par­ties, in­clud­ing the Con­gress and re­gional party Rah­striya Janata Dal (RJD), are op­posed to elec­tions be­ing held so soon, rais­ing con­cerns that so­cial dis­tanc­ing would be hard to en­force and that their can­di­dates could be un­fairly hit with mul­ti­ple poll code vi­o­la­tions.</p>
    <p>“Any MLA (Mem­ber of the Leg­isla­tive Assem­bly) or MP, when he goes into a con­stituency, will be sur­rounded by peo­ple. So, how will they man­age the five peo­ple rule? It can’t be en­forced. It is not vi­able,” said Mr Shivanand Ti­wari of the RJD.</p>
    <p>“Thou­sands of cases of poll code vi­o­la­tions will be filed. This is the sit­u­a­tion. All op­po­si­tion par­ties and even one rul­ing al­liance part­ner (Lok Jan­shakti Party) are op­posed to the elec­tions.”</p>
    <p>The RJD was ini­tially part of Mr Ku­mar’s JDU win­ning al­liance, which won 175 seats in 2015, while the BJP al­liance won 59 seats in the 243-seat assem­bly.</p>
    <p>But in 2017, Mr Ku­mar split with the RJD and tied up with the BJP, an old ally.</p>
    <p>The BJP-JDU al­liance is seen to have the edge in the up­com­ing elec­tions and is bank­ing on vir­tual ral­lies and so­cial me­dia cam­paigns, a strength of the BJP, to reach vot­ers.</p>
    <p>A spokesman for the party in Bi­har, Mr Prem Ran­jan Pa­tel, said that the party saw no prob­lems with hold­ing elec­tions in a coun­try where cam­paign­ing con­tin­ues to evolve.</p>
    <p>“First peo­ple went cam­paign­ing on bul­lock carts, and then bikes, cars and jeeps. Now, the vir­tual medium is go­ing to be ev­ery­thing. Tech­nol­ogy is de­vel­op­ing and in any vil­lage, there are 50 smart­phones min­i­mum,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Coro­n­avirus is not go­ing to end in three or four months. A vac­cine hasn’t come, and even when it does, it will take a year for ev­ery­one to get it. Elec­tions can’t be post­poned in­def­i­nitely.”</p>
    <p>The party plans to cam­paign on the is­sue of de­vel­op­ment and the work done by the chief min­is­ter and Prime Min­is­ter Modi.</p>
    <p>Still, elec­tion watch­ers said the pan­demic and use of tech­nol­ogy would de­prive poorer par­ties of a level play­ing field.</p>
    <p>Some four mil­lion peo­ple watched fed­eral Home Min­is­ter Amit Shah in a vir­tual rally on spe­cially set up LED screens, smart­phones and tele­vi­sions re­cently.</p>
    <p>“The guide­lines are fairly com­pre­hen­sive, but you know en­sur­ing those things in the field is al­ways the dif­fi­cult part,” said Mr Jagdeep S. Ch­hokar, founder-mem­ber of the As­so­ci­a­tion of Demo­cratic Re­forms.</p>
    <p>“It will be­come all about the party or can­di­date that has the money and, there­fore, can har­ness the state-of-the-art tech­nol­ogy. The ques­tion of a level play­ing field will not arise be­cause there will be no field.”</p>
