    <p>South Korea has re­ported yet an­other record daily high in Covid-19 cases, with new clus­ters found all over the coun­try, as the author­i­ties ex­panded test­ing ca­pa­bil­ity to track down asymp­to­matic cases in the third and most se­vere wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>There were 1,078 new cases yes­ter­day, beat­ing Sun­day’s record of 1,030 and rais­ing the tally to 45,442.</p>
    <p>The health author­i­ties ad­mit­ted that the cur­rent Level 2.5 so­cial dis­tanc­ing – in place since Dec 7 in Seoul and the greater Seoul area, where most of the clus­ters are – has failed to flat­ten the in­fec­tion curve, and the weekly av­er­age of 832.6 cases a day now calls for the high­est Level 3.</p>
    <p>South Korea has re­ported yet an­other record daily high in Covid-19 cases, with new clus­ters found all over the coun­try, in­clud­ing one at a pop­u­lar ski re­sort, as the author­i­ties ex­pand test­ing ca­pa­bil­ity to track down asymp­to­matic cases in the third and most se­vere wave of in­fec­tions.</p>
    <p>A to­tal of 1,078 new cases were added yes­ter­day, beat­ing Sun­day’s record of 1,030 and rais­ing the tally to 45,442.</p>
    <p>The health author­i­ties ad­mit­ted that the cur­rent Level 2.5 so­cial dis­tanc­ing – in place since Dec 7 in Seoul and the greater Seoul area, where most of the clus­ters are – has failed to flat­ten the in­fec­tion curve, and the weekly av­er­age of 832.6 cases a day now calls for the high­est Level 3.</p>
    <p>Most ar­eas out­side of the cap­i­tal area are un­der Level 2.</p>
    <p>Level 3, meant to be im­posed when the num­ber of daily cases hits 800 to 1,000, will ban gath­er­ings of 10 or more peo­ple and shut down all non-es­sen­tial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>This is the clos­est thing to a lock­down for South Kore­ans, al­though it may seem le­nient com­pared with more dras­tic mea­sures in other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>Calls have grown for Level 3 to be im­posed – even from small busi­ness own­ers, who have suf­fered losses from at least two rounds of manda­tory clo­sures but would rather face the tough­est mea­sures now to stem the chain of trans­mis­sion.</p>
    <p>But the gov­ern­ment in­sists that Level 3 should be a last re­sort.</p>
    <p>Prime Min­is­ter Chung Sye-kyun, chair­ing a daily in­ter-agency meet­ing yes­ter­day, or­dered min­istries to re­view sup­port mea­sures to mit­i­gate the im­pact on the economy and liveli­hoods if so­cial dis­tanc­ing is raised to the high­est level. “Pre­pared sup­port would pave the way for a quick re­cov­ery,” he said.</p>
    <p>For now, he added, the gov­ern­ment’s fo­cus is on se­cur­ing enough hospi­tal beds. Con­tain­ers have al­ready been con­verted into tem­po­rary wards, and mil­i­tary hos­pi­tals are be­ing opened up.</p>
    <p>The De­fence Min­istry said the Armed Forces Gen­eral Hospi­tal in the cen­tral city of Dae­jeon started re­ceiv­ing Covid-19 pa­tients yes­ter­day, and two more mil­i­tary hos­pi­tals will open to civil­ians soon.</p>
    <p>About 960 sol­diers and 41 army med­i­cal staff were dis­patched yes­ter­day to 160 pub­lic health cen­tres in the greater Seoul area to pro­vide virus-test­ing sup­port for three weeks.</p>
    <p>South Korea has been ex­pand­ing its test­ing ca­pa­bil­ity by set­ting up tem­po­rary test­ing cen­tres and ex­tend­ing op­er­at­ing hours of ex­ist­ing fa­cil­i­ties, as part of pre-emp­tive mea­sures to sniff out asymp­to­matic cases.</p>
    <p>Clus­ters have popped up na­tion­wide, out­pac­ing con­tact trac­ing ef­forts. Yong­py­ong ski re­sort, in the eastern province of Gang­won and made fa­mous glob­ally by the 2002 Korean drama Win­ter Sonata, re­ported 10 cases as at yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>A dor­mi­tory for Ajou Mo­tor Col­lege in Bo­ryeong city re­ported 21 cases, while a nurs­ing home in Goyang city, north of Seoul, found 30 cases.</p>
    <p>A study from Oct 1 to last Thurs­day by the Korea Dis­ease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency (KDCA) said the most com­mon source of trans­mis­sion is gath­er­ings with fam­ily and friends.</p>
    <p>Work­places were ranked sec</p>
    <p>ond, fol­lowed by con­va­les­cent/ care, fit­ness/recre­ational and health­care fa­cil­i­ties.</p>
    <p>The KDCA urged peo­ple to avoid non-es­sen­tial out­ings and spend the win­ter hol­i­days at home with house­hold mem­bers only, and to “ex­press love to fam­ily and friends through let­ters or video chat”.</p>
