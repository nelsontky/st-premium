    <p>MOSCOW • Rus­sia plans to share pre­lim­i­nary re­sults of its Covid-19 vac­cine trial based on the first six weeks of mon­i­tor­ing par­tic­i­pants, rais­ing the tempo in an al­ready fren­zied global race to end the coro­n­avirus pan­demic.</p>
    <p>Dr Alexan­der Gints­burg, head of the Ga­ma­leya In­sti­tute that pro­duced the Sput­nik V vac­cine, said the pace of its de­vel­op­ment was nec­es­sary un­der the “wartime” con­di­tions of a pan­demic but that no cor­ners were be­ing cut.</p>
    <p>Rus­sia has pushed ahead with its po­ten­tial Covid-19 vac­cine at top speed with mass public vac­ci­na­tions along­side the main hu­man trial, rais­ing con­cerns that it was pri­ori­tis­ing na­tional pres­tige over solid science and safety.</p>
    <p>“Peo­ple are dy­ing just like dur­ing a war. But this fast-tracked pace is not syn­ony­mous, as some me­dia have sug­gested, with cor­ners be­ing cut. No way,” said Dr Gints­burg, adding that all the guide­lines for test­ing Sput­nik V’s safety and ef­fi­cacy had been fol­lowed.</p>
    <p>The plan to pub­lish in­terim re­sults based on the first 42 days of mon­i­tor­ing vol­un­teers means Rus­sia has a high chance of be­com­ing the first world­wide to an­nounce any data from a fi­nal-stage trial, which is known as phase three.</p>
    <p>The first of 5,000 vol­un­teers was vac­ci­nated on Sept 9, which means in­terim re­sults could be is­sued some time after Oct 21.</p>
    <p>Sev­eral Western de­vel­op­ers are con­duct­ing fi­nal-stage tri­als that have been go­ing on for more than 42 days but have not pub­lished any in­terim re­sults.</p>
    <p>Dr Gints­burg said there was a public in­ter­est ar­gu­ment for shar­ing in­terim re­sults after 42 days as they would show the gen­eral trend in the data. “For me, it is too short. But for peo­ple who are in­ter­ested in how things are go­ing, it is al­ready too long.”</p>
    <p>He said vol­un­teers would be mon­i­tored for 180 days after the last of 40,000 par­tic­i­pants was vac­ci­nated. Six months on, his team planned to tally fi­nal re­sults and pub­lish them. Their early-stage trial re­sults were peer-re­viewed and pub­lished in The Lancet.</p>
    <p>In par­al­lel with the trial, Rus­sia be­gan inoc­u­lat­ing mem­bers of the gen­eral public con­sid­ered at high risk on Sept 8, another un­con­ven­tional move by Moscow in the race for a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>About 400 peo­ple have since been in­oc­u­lated. A govern­ment source said the in­terim phase three trial re­sults would likely in­form a de­ci­sion on whether to ex­pand this mass in­oc­u­la­tion drive, start­ing with peo­ple aged over 60.</p>
    <p>Moscow reg­is­tered 642 new Covid-19 cases on the day the trial be­gan. The in­fec­tion rate has risen since, with 2,217 new cases on Mon­day, though it is well below a peak of around 6,000 daily in­fec­tions in the cap­i­tal in early May.</p>
