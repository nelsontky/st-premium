    <p>LOS AN­GE­LES • Ac­tress Por­tia de Rossi de­fended Ellen DeGeneres on Mon­day af­ter a so­cial me­dia cam­paign called for the talk show host to step down, fol­low­ing re­ports of a hos­tile work en­vi­ron­ment for em­ploy­ees on set.</p>
    <p>De Rossi, who has been mar­ried to DeGeneres for 12 years, posted an “I Stand By Ellen” graphic on her In­sta­gram ac­count.</p>
    <p>“To all our fans... we see you. Thank you for your sup­port,” de Rossi, 47, wrote on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>The for­mer Ally McBeal (1997 to 2002) ac­tress also added the hash­tags #stop­b­o­tat­tacks and #bekind­toonean­other to her post.</p>
    <p>The Ellen DeGeneres Show (2003 to present) has won mul­ti­ple Emmy awards, but both the talk show and DeGeneres have been un­der fire for weeks.</p>
    <p>There were com­plaints by for­mer pro­duc­tions staff about a hos­tile work­place that in­cluded racism and bul­ly­ing by up­per man­age­ment and claims that the come­di­enne is mean-spir­ited.</p>
    <p>Warner Bros Tele­vi­sion, which pro­duces the talk show, con­ducted an in­ter­nal in­ves­ti­ga­tion and said last week that staffing changes and other mea­sures were be­ing taken to ad­dress the is­sue.</p>
    <p>DeGeneres, 62, also e-mailed staff, ex­press­ing re­grets about the gulf be­tween the show’s happy public face and what was some­times hap­pen­ing back­stage.</p>
    <p>Rather than damp­ing crit­i­cism, the de­vel­op­ments led to the #Re­placeEllen hash­tag, which went vi­ral on Mon­day.</p>
    <p>Users sug­gested that celebri­ties rang­ing from Bri­tish singer Harry Styles to for­mer United States first lady Michelle Obama should take over the show.</p>
    <p>Other celebri­ties such as Ar­gen­tine polo player Na­cho Figueras and DJ Sa­man­tha Ron­son pub­licly sup­ported DeGeneres.</p>
    <p>“She makes the world a bet­ter place for mil­lions of peo­ple every day and we can­not hit her be­cause some­thing may have not been perfect,” Figueras wrote on In­sta­gram.</p>
