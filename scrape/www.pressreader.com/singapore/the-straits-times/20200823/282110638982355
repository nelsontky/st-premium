    <p>BOS­TON • Dustin John­son looked poised to make golf history after a blis­ter­ing start at the North­ern Trust on Fri­day but had to set­tle for a sec­ond-round 11-un­der 60 and a two-stroke lead over Scot­tie Sch­ef­fler, who ear­lier be­came the new­est mem­ber of golf’s 59 club.</p>
    <p>John­son was 11 un­der through 11 holes and threat­ened to card the low­est sin­gle-round score in PGA Tour history. But he could only man­age pars over his fi­nal seven holes to sit two strokes clear of Sch­ef­fler and Cameron Davis head­ing into the week­end of the FedEx­Cup play-offs opener.</p>
    <p>The Amer­i­can had chances for 59 or bet­ter on his fi­nal two holes but his seven-foot birdie putt on 17 rimmed out of the cup and his 23-foot birdie at­tempt on 1 8 passed inches left of the hole be­fore he tapped i n for 60, the 36-year-old’s ca­reer low.</p>
    <p>Jim Furyk’s 58 in the fi­nal round of the 2016 Trav­el­ers Cham­pi­onship re­mains the low­est sin­gle round in Tour history.</p>
    <p>John­son said he was not l et down by his near-miss, leav­ing him with a 15-un­der 127 to­tal amid scorch­ing con­di­tions in Nor­ton, Mas­sachusetts.</p>
    <p>“Any­time you shoot a num­ber like that, you’re never go­ing to be dis­ap­pointed,” he said. “I feel like my game is in good form.”</p>
    <p>PGA Tour rookie Sch­ef­fler’s siz­zling shot-mak­ing led to a new TPC Bos­ton course record after his 59, just the 12th sub-60 round in PGA Tour history. The 24-yearold, who played in the fi­nal pair­ing of the PGA Cham­pi­onship l ess than two weeks ago, be­came the sec­ond-youngest player to shoot a 59 on the Tour after Justin Thomas, who was 23, in 2017.</p>
    <p>“Had some key up-and-downs at the beginning of the round that kind of got me rolling, freed me up a lit­tle bit,” said the world No. 45, who needed just 23 putts in his round. “Then the mo­men­tum just kind of kept go­ing.”</p>
    <p>Fif­teen-time Ma­jor win­ner Tiger Woods fin­ished his sec­ond round at even par and made the cut on the three-un­der cut­line.</p>
    <p>This week’s tour­na­ment, open to the top 125 golfers in the sea­son­long points stand­ings, is the first of three play-off events that cul­mi­nate in the Sept 4-7 Tour Cham­pi­onship in At­lanta and the US$15 mil­lion (S$20.7 mil­lion) prize to the FedEx­Cup cham­pion.</p>
    <p>Only the top 70 in the stand­ings after this week go on to the BMW Cham­pi­onship. From there, the top 30 move on to At­lanta.</p>
