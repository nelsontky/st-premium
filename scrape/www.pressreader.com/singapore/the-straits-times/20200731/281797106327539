    <p>BRASILIA/SAO PAULO • Brazil has re­opened in­ter­na­tional air travel to for­eign tourists, which had been banned since March, even as its coro­n­avirus out­break ranks as the world’s sec­ond worst.</p>
    <p>Tourists from all coun­tries can travel to Brazil as long as they have health insurance for the du­ra­tion of their trip, the govern­ment said in a de­cree on Wednes­day which did not ex­plain the ra­tio­nale for the de­ci­sion.</p>
    <p>Bans on for­eign trav­ellers ar­riv­ing by land or sea, how­ever, were ex­tended for an­other 30 days.</p>
    <p>Brazil, the sec­ond worst-hit coun­try after the United States, is re­open­ing its air bor­ders faster than other coun­tries in the re­gion with less se­vere out­breaks, such as Colom­bia, Ar­gentina, Panama and Peru, which re­main closed to in­ter­na­tional com­mer­cial flights.</p>
    <p>While tourists can now visit Brazil, many coun­tries have not taken re­cip­ro­cal ac­tion due to the sever­ity of the out­break. The US and Euro­pean Union, for ex­am­ple, are open for in­ter­na­tional travel but do not al­low tourists from Brazil.</p>
    <p>The coun­try is hurtling to­wards the mile­stone of 100,000 deaths from the coro­n­avirus.</p>
    <p>The 69,074 new con­firmed cases and 1,595 ad­di­tional deaths re­ported on Wednes­day – record daily fig­ures – pushed the coun­try past 2.5 mil­lion in­fec­tions and 90,000 dead.</p>
    <p>Pres­i­dent Jair Bol­sonaro has fought against re­stric­tions on eco­nomic ac­tiv­ity, and the dis­ease has ad­vanced as gov­er­nors and may­ors have yielded to the pres­sure. In some cases, Brazil­ians have packed bars and crowded pub­lic squares with­out masks, of­ten in de­fi­ance of lo­cal rules.</p>
    <p>Last week, Brazil recorded 7,677 deaths, the most fa­tal­i­ties in any week since the pan­demic be­gan, de­fy­ing re­peated pre­dic­tions that the out­break had peaked.</p>
    <p>“Brazil is ex­pe­ri­enc­ing the worst phase of the pan­demic,” said Dr Alexan­dre Naime, head of the depart­ment of in­fec­tious dis­eases at Sao Paulo State Univer­sity. “Para­dox­i­cally, pub­lic pol­icy and per­sonal be­hav­iour are go­ing in the op­po­site di­rec­tion, as if we are not liv­ing through a daily tragedy.”</p>
    <p>Brazil is fac­ing a record eco­nomic con­trac­tion of 9.1 per cent this year, ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional Mone­tary Fund.</p>
