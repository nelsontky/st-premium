    <p>HONG KONG • Wealth man­agers in Asia are pre­par­ing to lend more to their clients and help them raise cash by sell­ing in­vest­ments to en­sure they can get their hands on shares in Chi­nese fintech gi­ant Ant Group’s ini­tial pub­lic of­fer­ing (IPO) of up to US$30 bil­lion (S$41 bil­lion), bankers have said.</p>
    <p>The re­gion’s wealth man­agers rou­tinely of­fer loans to ma­jor clients for them to sub­scribe to IPOs, but they are now go­ing the ex­tra mile to of­fer ac­cess to what could be the world’s largest list­ing be­cause the deals are lu­cra­tive and come at a time when the Covid-19 pan­demic has hit new busi­ness growth.</p>
    <p>And get­ting the de­sired num­ber of shares al­lot­ted on the block­buster list­ing could be tricky be­cause the tech­nol­ogy sec­tor is fan­cied by in­vestors, and the big­ger the investment in the IPO, the greater the chances of se­cur­ing al­lot­ment, bankers said.</p>
    <p>“If it’s the world’s largest IPO, it be­comes manda­tory for the wealth man­agers to try to get their clients on the front seats,” said a Hong Kong-based se­nior banker at a Euro­pean wealth man­ager that man­ages more than US$200 bil­lion in as­sets.</p>
    <p>“For an of­fer­ing like this, you can boost your chances of al­lot­ment only by rais­ing the bid size, and that will hap­pen only by in­creased lever­age,” said the banker, de­clin­ing to be named as he was not au­tho­rised to speak to the me­dia.</p>
    <p>Ant, an arm of Chi­nese e-com­merce gi­ant Alibaba Group, did not dis­close the size, timetable or other key de­tails of the of­fer­ing in its pre­lim­i­nary prospec­tus filed last week. But sources have said the dual list­ing in Shanghai and Hong Kong could raise as much as US$30 bil­lion and come as soon as next month.</p>
    <p>Wealth man­age­ment firms i n Asia, in­clud­ing Bank of Sin­ga­pore, Credit Suisse, Julius Baer and UBS, al­ready pro­vide loans against se­cu­ri­ties. They profit from the in­ter­est they charge as well as from bro­ker­age fees.</p>
    <p>The loan-to-value ra­tio – the sum that one can bor­row against the to­tal value of the un­der­ly­ing as­set – at top wealth man­agers for IPOs in Asia ranges be­tween 30 per cent and 50 per cent, depend­ing on mar­ket con­di­tions and com­pany fun­da­men­tals.</p>
    <p>In Ant’s case, some banks are look­ing to raise that to as much as 80 per cent, said the sources.</p>
    <p>And given the low in­ter­est rates and a rally in tech­nol­ogy stocks, some pri­vate banks have re­versed moves in­tro­duced ear­lier this year to cut or even stop sin­gle-stock loans as they were deemed a high­risk busi­ness in a volatile mar­ket, they said.</p>
    <p>Some wealth man­agers are also ad­vis­ing clients in the re­gion to pare or exit their hold­ings in fixed-in­come and other un­der­per­form­ing se­cu­ri­ties to free up liq­uid­ity to par­tic­i­pate in the Ant IPO, the sources said.</p>
    <p>“De­spite the size of the IPO, de­mand for tech is huge, so there’ll be a scram­ble for al­lo­ca­tions,” said a Sin­ga­pore-based wealth man­ager at a French bank who also de­clined to be named as he was not au­tho­rised to speak to the me­dia.</p>
    <p>“I have told my clients to be pa­tient and look for trades in the sec­ondary mar­ket. This is a longterm trade, not just an IPO trade.”</p>
