    <p>Ac­tress Zoe Kravitz (left) took aim at stream­ing ser­vice Hulu af­ter it con­firmed the can­cel­la­tion of High Fidelity, point­ing out the lack of di­ver­sity in its con­tent.</p>
    <p>Kravitz, 31, played the pro­tag­o­nist in the show based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Nick Hornby, which cen­tred on the re­la­tion­ships of a record-store owner in a rapidly gen­tri­fy­ing neigh­bour­hood in Brook­lyn, New York.</p>
    <p>The Hulu se­ries, which ran for only one sea­son, was a re­boot of the 2000 John Cu­sack film. Kravitz’s mother, Lisa Bonet, had starred in the movie.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the news the show would not be re­newed, Kravitz posted a pic­ture of the cast on In­sta­gram last Fri­day with the cap­tion: “I wanna give a shout out to my #high­fi­delity fam­ily. Thank you for all the love and heart you put into this show. I’m in awe of all of you. And thank you to ev­ery­one who watched, loved and sup­ported us. #breakupssu­ck.”</p>
    <p>Sev­eral ac­tors, in­clud­ing Mindy Kal­ing and Reese Wither­spoon, ex­pressed their dis­may at the can­cel­la­tion, in­clud­ing Thor: Rag­narok (2017) ac­tress Tessa Thomp­son, 36, who wrote: “I will miss you al­l­l­l­l­l­l­l­l­l­lll so much.”</p>
    <p>Kravitz added: “It’s cool. At least Hulu has a ton of other shows star­ring women of colour we can watch. Oh wait.”</p>
    <p>Hulu has just a hand­ful of se­ries with women of colour in the lead, in­clud­ing Four Wed­dings And A Fu­neral, star­ring Game Of Thrones’ Nathalie Em­manuel; and The Mindy Project, star­ring Kal­ing. Lit­tle Fires Ev­ery­where has Scandal’s Kerry Wash­ing­ton in the lead.</p>
    <p>Most of Hulu’s pro­grammes with peo­ple of colour in the lead are male-dom­i­nated, such as Wu-Tang: An Amer­i­can Saga, fea­tur­ing a pre­dom­i­nantly black cast; as well as Ramy, star­ring Emmy-nom­i­nated Mus­lim ac­tor Ramy Youssef.</p>
