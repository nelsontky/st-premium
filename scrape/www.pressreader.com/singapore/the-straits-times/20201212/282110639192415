    <p>As a par­ent with young chil­dren, I am con­cerned about how lo­cal pre-schools and kinder­gartens han­dle cases of food poi­son­ing and in­fec­tious dis­eases (Num­ber of sick pupils from pre-school rises to 60, Dec 10).</p>
    <p>The way the pre-school in New­ton re­sponded to the re­cent in­ci­dent brings to mind how it was han­dled at my child’s school.</p>
    <p>In our case, we found out through fel­low par­ents who shared that their chil­dren were ill with food poi­son­ing symp­toms. By the time the school sent a formal com­mu­ni­ca­tion to all par­ents, there were at least eight known cases, di­ag­nosed over a pe­riod of two weeks.</p>
    <p>The school then took an­other week to re­spond to us on spe­cific ac­tions taken. Food sam­ples from the food caterer were taken for test­ing, and the re­sults were shared with par­ents nearly three months af­ter the out­break. While wait­ing for test re­sults, the school used the same food caterer.</p>
    <p>Par­ents should be in­formed as soon as mul­ti­ple cases of any dis­ease have been re­ported to the school or when sev­eral chil­dren dis­play sim­i­lar symp­toms.</p>
    <p>By do­ing so, par­ents can help to look out for symp­toms in their chil­dren and keep them at home to pre­vent fur­ther in­fec­tion. More im­por­tantly, in­formed par­ents can en­sure that their chil­dren re­ceive med­i­cal at­ten­tion promptly, es­pe­cially in cases where the dis­ease is life-threat­en­ing.</p>
    <p>Keep­ing par­ents in the dark not only jeop­ar­dises the well-be­ing of young chil­dren but could also have se­vere ram­i­fi­ca­tions on pub­lic health, as we have wit­nessed dur­ing the Covid-19 pan­demic.</p>
    <p>On this note, could the Early Child­hood Devel­op­ment Agency com­ment on the pro­to­cols that pre-schools and kinder­gartens should fol­low when it comes to in­fec­tious dis­ease man­age­ment?</p>
    <p>When should par­ents and the health au­thor­i­ties be in­formed af­ter cases of in­fec­tious dis­ease emerge within a school?</p>
    <p>Who is re­spon­si­ble for assess­ing that re­me­di­a­tion steps are im­ple­mented well enough to pre­vent a re­peat in­ci­dent?</p>

        <p data-role="text">Kid&#xAD;di&#xAD;winkie School&#xAD;house @ New&#xAD;ton saw an out&#xAD;break of sal&#xAD;mo&#xAD;nella and stom&#xAD;ach flu this week. Some par&#xAD;ents com&#xAD;plained that the pre-school had told them not to speak to other par&#xAD;ents about the out&#xAD;break when they called to ask about the sit&#xAD;u&#xAD;a&#xAD;tion. The writer says keep&#xAD;ing par&#xAD;ents in the dark jeop&#xAD;ar&#xAD;dises the well-be&#xAD;ing of young chil&#xAD;dren.</p>
