    <p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)</p>
    <p>Try not to worry too much about work or chores. You need to ex­er­cise your body and maybe your mind. Go for a run or a nice, long ride on your bike.</p>
    <p>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</p>
    <p>You and a friend or col­league are ar­gu­ing, but there is some­thing deeper go­ing on. Try not to worry too much about how it will all turn out.</p>
    <p>Gem­ini (May 21 - June 20)</p>
    <p>You may stum­ble upon a nifty so­lu­tion to an old prob­lem or you may just en­joy the give and take be­tween you and some­one of like mind.</p>
    <p>Can­cer (June 21 - July 22)</p>
    <p>The fu­ture is on your mind and you should be able to make some solid pre­dic­tions based on what you al­ready know.</p>
    <p>Leo (July 23 - Aug 22)</p>
    <p>A new day shows that your lat­est suc­cess is even big­ger than you thought it would be. Things should get even bet­ter from here.</p>
    <p>Virgo (Aug 23 - Sept 22)</p>
    <p>You want to help your friends, but there is only so much of you to go around.</p>
    <p>Try not to feel bad about the sit­u­a­tion – your heart is in the right place.</p>
    <p>Libra (Sept 23 - Oct 22)</p>
    <p>Your friends are key to your hap­pi­ness. Check in with your most im­por­tant pals and get them to spill what is re­ally hap­pen­ing.</p>
    <p>Scorpio (Oct 23 - Nov 21)</p>
    <p>The day could present a chal­lenge, but you can rise to it. You do not have to, but the fruits of suc­cess are great enough that you should think about it se­ri­ously.</p>
    <p>Sagittariu­s (Nov 22 - Dec 21)</p>
    <p>Show some­one what is go­ing on in­side you or chal­lenge as­sump­tions at work. Your com­mu­ni­ca­tion skills are en­hanced, so make the most of them.</p>
    <p>Capricorn (Dec 22 - Jan 19)</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are ask­ing too much of you.</p>
    <p>How you han­dle it says a lot about you and how much you have to en­dure from peo­ple with lit­tle per­spec­tive.</p>
    <p>Aquarius (Jan 20 - Feb 18)</p>
    <p>Big things are hap­pen­ing, so see if you can push your­self to take ad­van­tage of them. You may look back on the day as a turn­ing point.</p>
    <p>Pisces (Feb 19 - March 20)</p>
    <p>There is far too much drama swirling around for you to take events se­ri­ously. Things are not up to your stan­dards of truth and open­ness. • Pro­vided by Astrol­ogy.com (www.astrol­ogy.com)</p>
