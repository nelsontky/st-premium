    <p>In a sea of beau­ti­ful, stylish In­sta­gram It girls, Mae Tan (@marx­mae) stands out for the re­al­ness she brings to the ta­ble.</p>
    <p>A cur­sory glance at her so­cial me­dia re­veals an aes­thetic that is a far cry from the per­fectly lit, art­fully (if ar­ti­fi­cially) posed per­fec­tion that sat­u­rates peo­ple’s feeds.</p>
    <p>In­stead, Tan, who has 113,000 fol­low­ers on In­sta­gram, leans to­wards a rawer aes­thetic, am­pli­fied by her pen­chant for tomboy­ish pieces, vin­tage gear, cult streetwear brands and in­die de­sign­ers on the rise – a re­flec­tion of the cu­ra­to­rial eye she honed in her pre­vi­ous role as cre­ative man­ager for multi-la­bel bou­tique Sur­ren­der.</p>
    <p>That raw­ness seeps into con­ver­sa­tions as well. Tan, who is 25 and works as a cre­ative con­sul­tant, is can­did, un­fil­tered and un­var­nished – traits fa­mil­iar to those who binged on last year’s hit Net­flix re­al­ity show Sin­ga­pore So­cial, in which she was a cen­tral cast mem­ber.</p>
    <p>When I meet her, fresh from the Bazaar shoot, she had just changed into a black, over­sized Prada Re-Ny­lon shirt and match­ing boxer-like shorts. “Now I feel like my­self again,” she says, laugh­ing as she set­tles into a cross-legged po­si­tion.</p>
    <p>We are at her fam­ily home, a 31/ 2- storey Peter Tay-de­signed gem nes­tled in the quiet, leafy en­clave of Bukit Timah.</p>
    <p>The sleek, su­per­sized Mod­ernist mon­u­ment is ex­actly what one would ex­pect the res­i­dence of one of Sin­ga­pore’s most prom­i­nent re­tail fam­i­lies – her fa­ther Dave Tan brings in Swiss lux­ury watch brand Richard Mille, Mi­lan-based fash­ion la­bel Off-White and French per­fume brand Henry Jac­ques – to be.</p>
    <p>But within that, Mae Tan has carved out an idio­syn­cratic space all her own. Her gen­er­ously sized per­sonal quar­ters on the first floor have been split into three dis­tinct spa­ces.</p>
    <p>“I wanted the bed­room to be a calm space where I can chill, so the pal­ette is muted and re­laxed. I wanted to have plants and that’s also where my can­dles and books are. Af­ter a long day, I just sit on the bed and, im­me­di­ately, I feel calm,” she says.</p>
    <p>Her favourite space, though, is the lounge at the other end. “It’s where I spend the most time. My friends and I hang out there, watch­ing Net­flix or lis­ten­ing to mu­sic.”</p>
    <p>That space is grounded by a bright red For­nasetti rug fea­tur­ing a polka-dot­ted fe­line.</p>
    <p>“My dad bought all of us rugs when we moved in last year. Ini­tially, I wanted this space to be mel­low as well, but be­cause this be­came the cen­tre­piece, I worked ev­ery­thing else around it,” she says.</p>
    <p>As a re­sult, bright colours spill over onto the walls, with ev­ery sur­face cov­ered by prints, pho­to­graphs and paint­ings.</p>
    <p>A Takashi Mu­rakami paint­ing – “the first piece of art I ever bought” – takes pride of place, along­side posters bought on her trav­els, prints from fash­ion brands, paint­ings made by friends, framed scarves and hand­ker­chiefs, a skate deck, a vin­tage Karl Lager­feld photo and a wall hang­ing from a Vir­gil Abloh x Ikea col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>A re­fur­bished desk from Sec­ond Charm paired with a Pierre Jean­neret-in­spired chair make up her work space.</p>
    <p>In be­tween the bed­room and the lounge is Tan’s mas­sive walk-in</p>
    <p>Ev­ery­thing else can be su­per sub­tle, but I like to have one item – like a bag, shoe or a vin­tage jacket – that is a con­ver­sa­tion­starter piece.</p>
    <p>IN­FLU­ENCER MAE TAN (above) on her style</p>
    <p>wardrobe, an­chored around a huge cen­tral is­land on which a DJ con­sole sits.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t plan to put that there,” she says, “but some­how, ev­ery­one loves it in there, so now, when I have friends over, we just party in the wardrobe, which is crazy.”</p>
    <p>The fact she has enough space in the wardrobe to throw par­ties is, ad­mit­tedly, a lit­tle whack. “Ev­ery­body was ask­ing why I needed so much space for the wardrobe, but with my styling work, and es­pe­cially dur­ing fash­ion weeks, we’re pulling things in and out so much that I need as much floor space as pos­si­ble,” she says.</p>
    <p>The wardrobe is filled to the brim, but Tan con­fesses she has been try­ing to be more con­scious of her con­sump­tion. “I love fash­ion a lot, but at the same time, I’ve also been in the in­dus­try for so long that I un­der­stand how much waste goes into it,” she says.</p>
    <p>“Last year, I went through a sort of cri­sis be­cause I was torn be­tween my morals and what I loved do­ing. Then I re­alised it didn’t have to be one or the other. It’s about find­ing a bal­ance.</p>
    <p>“So now, I no longer buy fast fash­ion. I buy more vin­tage or if I buy de­signer pieces, I ask my­self, ‘Will this item hold its value? Will I love it just as much af­ter 20 years?’”</p>
    <p>The de­sign­ers she loves have proven their longevity and value far be­yond 20 years. “I love Vivi­enne West­wood and Prada be­cause their clothes make me feel strong, con­fi­dent,” she says.</p>
    <p>“For West­wood, even though the clothes are quite bo­hemian, she al­ways finds a way to struc­ture them that cre­ates this nice fit and strong sil­hou­ette.</p>
    <p>“With Prada, I’m drawn to the work­wear and the sim­pler stuff. Prada’s women are strong women. I love that she al­ways plays with the idea of fem­i­nin­ity and jux­ta­po­si­tions. She might add an el­e­ment of sex­i­ness. Her sexy is dif­fer­ent.”</p>
    <p>Asked if sex­i­ness is some­thing she strives for when dress­ing up, she says: “Nat­u­rally, I’m more of a tomboy­ish char­ac­ter, so for my day-to-day out­fits, I like big fits and men’s cloth­ing. But some­times, I do want some­thing that shows my fig­ure or a sense of sex­i­ness. Even then, it’s still all about jux­ta­po­si­tion for me, so it’ll prob­a­bly be a men’s shirt over a tight lit­tle cropped top and over­sized trousers.”</p>
    <p>Her ma­jor pre­oc­cu­pa­tion when it comes to fash­ion lies more in high-im­pact de­tails.</p>
    <p>“Ev­ery­thing else can be su­per sub­tle, but I like to have one item – like a bag, shoe or a vin­tage jacket – that is a con­ver­sa­tion-starter piece.”</p>
    <p>When it comes to vin­tage, she is spoilt for choice – her mother, Ms Janet Toh, 56, has an ex­ten­sive col­lec­tion.</p>
    <p>“I’m so happy I can take all her vin­tage stuff. I’ve stolen her belts, bags – ev­ery­thing, re­ally. Her first Chanel bag is with me, as well as her first Louis Vuit­ton Keepall,” she says with a laugh.</p>
    <p>Ms Toh chimes in: “From a young age, I was in­ter­ested in fash­ion. Ev­ery trend you can think of, I’ve pretty much tried it. Disco with the gogo trousers? I did that. And a lot of the things that are now in fash­ion are things from my time mak­ing a come­back. So I guess, in a way, her fash­ion sense came from me?”</p>
    <p>It seems Tan’s sar­to­rial bold­ness, too, was in some ways shaped by her mother.</p>
    <p>“When I don’t know if some­thing works, she’s the one I go to and ask, ‘Do I look too crazy?’” says Tan. “And she’ll usu­ally tell me, ‘You just do you. If you think you look good in it and you feel good in it, then just wear it.’”</p>
    <p>Ms Toh adds: “I’m open-minded about a lot of things. I don’t stop Mae from do­ing any­thing be­cause I feel you have to let your chil­dren learn and dis­cover on their own.”</p>
    <p>The learn­ing and the fash­ion in­flu­ence cer­tainly go both ways.</p>
    <p>Ms Toh says: “A lot of the things she likes are things I’d also like. And some­times, she also likes the things I buy.”</p>
    <p>Tan adds: “Like right now, she’s buy­ing more Prada, which I love. I think we meet some­where in the mid­dle.”</p>
    <p>That give-and-take is ev­i­dent in the way they ap­proached the decor of the fam­ily home as well.</p>
    <p>If she had her way, Tan would have kept the out­door area as wild, leafy and grassy as pos­si­ble, in­ter­ject­ing it with mod­ern, even avant­garde, art and sculp­tures. Her par­ents, how­ever, have a predilec­tion for tra­di­tional Asian art­work and a pol­ished, clas­si­cal aes­thetic.</p>
    <p>“At the end of the day, it’s a fam­ily home,” Tan says. “Even though I was su­per metic­u­lous dur­ing the de­sign process, I recog­nise it’s a joint ef­fort and if some­one else isn’t happy, I can’t just im­pose my wants on him or her.”</p>
    <p>The spa­ces the fam­ily built to­gether have brought t hem closer, es­pe­cially dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod, says Tan, “when we spent so much time to­gether, which was quite rare”.</p>
    <p>“The place we spent the most time as a fam­ily was the din­ing area, as we made an ef­fort to eat to­gether. My brother and I also spent a lot of time do­ing jig­saw puz­zles to­gether in the liv­ing room – which was de­signed to be a so­cial space, with no TV, be­cause we wanted it to be a place for peo­ple to gather and have con­ver­sa­tions.”</p>
    <p>It is this pre­cise com­bi­na­tion of heart and high style that makes Tan one of the most ex­cit­ing style­set­ters of a new gen­er­a­tion.</p>
