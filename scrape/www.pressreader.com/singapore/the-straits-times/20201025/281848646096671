    <p>Reg­u­la­tions on the es­tab­lish­ment of In­done­sia’s first sov­er­eign wealth fund (SWF) will be ready in two to three weeks, and dis­cus­sions on pos­si­ble joint in­vest­ment with for­eign SWFs in In­done­sian projects have been held with the Abu Dhabi In­vest­ment Author­ity, Sin­ga­pore’s GIC, and the US In­ter­na­tional De­vel­op­ment Fi­nance Cor­po­ra­tion (DFC).</p>
    <p>“The idea is for In­done­sia to cre­ate a spe­cial pur­pose en­tity that is in­vested by the would-be formed In­done­sia In­vest­ment Author­ity and th­ese po­ten­tial in­vestors,” said Mr Sep­tian Hario Seto, a deputy min­is­ter in charge of min­ing and in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>Other pen­sion funds in de­vel­oped coun­tries have also ex­pressed in­ter­est in join­ing, he added.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing in a we­bi­nar last Fri­day, Mr Seto said the ini­tial cap­i­tal for the In­done­sia In­vest­ment Author­ity would be US$5 billion (S$6.79 billion). Tech­ni­cal teams at the sta­te­owned en­ter­prise and fi­nance min­istries have been draft­ing de­tailed im­ple­ment­ing reg­u­la­tions, he added.</p>
    <p>The In­done­sian gov­ern­ment wants to at­tract more for­eign funds to its in­fra­struc­ture projects via an SWF. It is go­ing the ex­tra mile to cre­ate jobs and sup­port the pandemic-bat­tered econ­omy, which is South­east Asia’s largest.</p>
    <p>The cre­ation of the first SWF is stip­u­lated in the Job Cre­ation Law rat­i­fied by Par­lia­ment on Oct 5, which was met with days of street protests by labour groups. The so-called om­nibus law sim­pli­fies the coun­try’s com­plex le­gal system and bu­reau­cracy to en­cour­age in­vest­ment.</p>
    <p>While the gov­ern­ment says the law would boost for­eign in­vest­ment and re­vive the econ­omy, union lead­ers have slammed it as ex­ploita­tive of work­ers and harm­ful to the en­vi­ron­ment.</p>
    <p>The gov­ern­ment sub­mit­ted the Bill to Par­lia­ment in Fe­bru­ary for de­lib­er­a­tion but it was set aside for re­view in April af­ter labour groups stepped up street protests. Par­lia­ment re­vived the mea­sure for de­lib­er­a­tion in July.</p>
    <p>The eco­nomic slump due to the Covid-19 pandemic has helped the gov­ern­ment’s push for the new leg­is­la­tion. More than 3.7 mil­lion peo­ple have lost their jobs, bring­ing the es­ti­mated to­tal tally of the un­em­ployed to 10.6 mil­lion, or nearly 8 per cent of the 133 mil­lion work­ers in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>DFC chief ex­ec­u­tive Adam Boehler ar­rived in Jakarta last Fri­day on his sec­ond visit to dis­cuss pos­si­ble in­vest­ments. His agency had ear­lier ex­pressed in­ter­est in ex­plor­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties in phar­macy, de­fence and se­cu­rity, as well as en­ergy.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing his first visit in Jan­uary, Mr Boehler said the DFC is in­ter­ested in in­vest­ing in In­done­sia’s mar­itime zones, in­clud­ing in the Natuna is­lands.</p>
    <p>When asked by The Sun­day Times af­ter he met Pres­i­dent Joko Wi­dodo in Jan­uary, Mr Boehler said: “We are (go­ing to) look at a lot of dif­fer­ent in­vest­ments in the area… fish and tourism sound re­ally in­ter­est­ing.”</p>
    <p>He was re­fer­ring to In­done­sia’s ex­clu­sive eco­nomic zone near the Natuna is­lands.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the we­bi­nar or­gan­ised by the Jakarta For­eign Cor­re­spon­dents Club, Mr Seto also ad­dressed con­cerns that the om­nibus law would ham­per ef­forts to pro­tect the en­vi­ron­ment, say­ing that there were mis­con­cep­tions by var­i­ous par­ties.</p>
    <p>For ex­am­ple, he said, there is con­jec­ture that projects could start with­out the owner re­ceiv­ing an en­vi­ron­men­tal and im­pact as­sess­ment (Am­dal), which is a pre­req­ui­site to re­ceiv­ing an en­vi­ron­men­tal per­mit.</p>
    <p>Mr Seto stressed that the law clearly states that any party that has not been is­sued an Am­dal shall not pro­ceed with the pri­mary phase of any project.</p>
    <p>“For prac­ti­cal rea­sons, they can go ahead with cer­tain ac­tiv­i­ties that do not im­pact the en­vi­ron­ment – such as land pro­cure­ment, staff re­cruit­ment, pur­chases of ma­chin­ery – but they can­not start build­ing phys­i­cal fa­cil­i­ties or com­mence op­er­a­tions on a project with­out an Am­dal.”</p>
    <p>He added that the grant­ing of busi­ness li­cences un­der the om­nibus law is done with a risk-based method­ol­ogy. Ap­pli­cants in the medium- to high-risk cat­e­gory of busi­nesses – which pose po­ten­tial risks to health, safety and en­vi­ron­ment – face more strin­gent re­quire­ments, even if they are na­tional strate­gic projects.</p>
    <p>Mr Seto ar­gued that this new method will im­prove the ease of do­ing busi­ness in In­done­sia, as busi­nesses in the low-risk cat­e­gory – a sig­nif­i­cant chunk of the to­tal – would have an ac­cel­er­ated process in get­ting a busi­ness li­cence.</p>
