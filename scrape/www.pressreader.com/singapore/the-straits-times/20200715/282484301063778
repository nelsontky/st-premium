    <p>Ghost Of Tsushima is a love let­ter to chan­bara, or Ja­panese sa­mu­rai films.</p>
    <p>Think tense, bloody du­els amid fall­ing red leaves and stoic char­ac­ters strug­gling to cleave to bushido, the sa­mu­rai code of hon­our.</p>
    <p>A black-and-white fil­ter with a film grain ef­fect, dubbed Kuro­sawa mode af­ter leg­endary Ja­panese film­maker Akira Kuro­sawa, fur­ther adds to the vin­tage feel of the game.</p>
    <p>At the heart of the story is Jin Sakai, a lone sa­mu­rai who sur­vives a Mon­gol at­tack on the is­land of Tsushima in 1274. Faced with over­whelm­ing odds, Sakai adapts by strik­ing from the shad­ows, a less than hon­ourable way that brings him into con­flict with his un­cle and fa­ther-fig­ure, Lord Shimura.</p>
    <p>Mod­ern au­di­ences, though, are un­likely to be overly per­turbed by Sakai’s win-at-all-costs ap­proach. And the body count, while high, in­volves only en­emy com­bat­ants, not civil­ians.</p>
    <p>Trans­lated i nto game­play, the sa­mu­rai way is to con­front en­e­mies di­rectly. Dur­ing these “stand-offs”, the en­e­mies come at Sakai one at a time – hit­ting a but­ton at the right mo­ment in­stantly kills an en­emy.</p>
    <p>The stealthy ap­proach would be to sneak up be­hind en­e­mies and as­sas­si­nate them.</p>
    <p>The game of­fers an as­sort­ment of tools – from bows to smoke bombs to throw­ing knives – to kill or dis­tract en­e­mies.</p>
    <p>While I usu­ally pre­fer the sneaky way, the game gives you the free­dom and the gear – a va­ri­ety of ar­mour sets and charms – to make ei­ther ap­proach vi­able.</p>
    <p>Com­bat re­volves around Sakai’s katana. There are two types of at­tacks, as well as the abil­ity to parry or dodge. Cer­tain at­tacks (with a red vis­ual cue) can only be dodged, while a suc­cess­ful parry can lead to a killing blow. You can also switch among four com­bat stances to counter the four main en­emy types – based on the weapon they wield, like a spear or katana.</p>
    <p>Over­all, the com­bat re­wards pre­ci­sion and the switch­ing of stances over but­ton mash­ing. It is also ac­ces­si­ble enough that even ca­sual gamers should find it en­joy­able.</p>
    <p>Ghost fol­lows the open-world for­mula per­fected by games such as</p>
    <p>Far Cry and Hori­zon Zero Dawn. Gather re­sources such as bam­boo and hides – from killing bears and boars – to up­grade your gear. Ex­plore the is­land to find spe­cial lo­ca­tions that im­prove your char­ac­ter – for in­stance, baths per­ma­nently in­crease the health bar by a small amount.</p>
    <p>But Ghost does in­tro­duce a new trick in the form of the Guid­ing Wind. In­stead of hav­ing an al­waysp­re­sent map with ar­row in­di­ca­tors to guide a player to a quest lo­ca­tion, the game has a “wind” that blows the player in the right direc­tion. It is bril­liant as it stream­lines the game’s user in­ter­face to make it feel more like a movie. And you can up­grade the wind to guide you to spe­cific types of lo­ca­tions, like baths and shrines that of­fer gear up­grades.</p>
    <p>There are sev­eral longer, mem­o­rable side quests in­volv­ing sup­port­ing char­ac­ters that span the story’s three acts. But most of the quests in Ghost are for­get­table and in­volve res­cu­ing lo­cals from Mon­gols or de­stroy­ing a Mon­gol camp.</p>
    <p>By com­plet­ing most of these quests, I was able to un­lock every skill by the mid­dle of the third act. This made my char­ac­ter too pow­er­ful for most en­coun­ters. The game seems to ac­knowl­edge this as the num­ber of side quests dry up sig­nif­i­cantly by the third act. Thus, the pac­ing could have been bet­ter han­dled.</p>
    <p>With its cin­e­matic feel and stun­ning vi­su­als, it is per­haps fit­ting that Ghost Of Tsushima is one of the last games for the PlayS­ta­tion 4 con­sole. Even though I have com­pleted the game, I can­not wait to see how it looks on the up­com­ing PlayS­ta­tion 5 – as­sum­ing it is sup­ported.</p>
