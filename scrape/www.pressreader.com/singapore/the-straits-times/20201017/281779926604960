    <p>China has been mak­ing moves to res­ur­rect its in­ter­na­tional im­age and po­si­tion it­self as a key part of any global so­lu­tion to Covid-19, as it con­tin­ues with its vac­cine de­vel­op­ment pro­grammes.</p>
    <p>On Oct 8, the coun­try signed on to Covax, the World Health Or­gan­i­sa­tion-backed ini­tia­tive for the dis­tri­bu­tion of Covid-19 vac­cines, join­ing 170 other na­tions.</p>
    <p>Its move stood in con­trast to Wash­ing­ton’s re­fusal to join the global scheme, which it ac­cused of hav­ing ties to or­gan­i­sa­tions ex­ces­sively in­flu­enced by Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>On Monday, Chi­nese me­dia re­ported that the state-owned Sinopharm Group had be­gun tak­ing reser­va­tions for its Covid-19 vac­cines, but this ap­peared not to be the case when the reser­va­tion por­tal was taken off­line.</p>
    <p>At a time when much of the world is still grap­pling with ris­ing in­fec­tion num­bers, ex­perts said, it was clear that Bei­jing was po­si­tion­ing it­self to be key to any so­lu­tion to the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>China’s in­ter­na­tional im­age took a hit when the coro­n­avirus first emerged in Wuhan last December.</p>
    <p>Crit­ics say Bei­jing mis­han­dled the ini­tial stages of the out­break, which al­lowed the virus to spread world­wide, crip­pling economies through lock­downs and leav­ing over one mil­lion peo­ple dead so far.</p>
    <p>But the coun­try has been on a mis­sion to re­claim the nar­ra­tive on Covid-19 for some months now.</p>
    <p>In May, Chi­nese Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping pledged US$2 bil­lion (S$2.72 bil­lion) over the next two years to tackle Covid-19. Bei­jing has also of­fered ac­cess to its vac­cines to other coun­tries.</p>
    <p>For­eign Min­istry spokesman Hua Chun­y­ing said on Oct 9 that join­ing Covax was an “im­por­tant mea­sure”, and China was ful­fill­ing its prom­ise to pro­mote a vac­cine as a global pub­lic good.</p>
    <p>“This is a smart move to re­as­sure the world that Bei­jing works with the in­ter­na­tional frame­work while the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion does not, hope­fully to counter the neg­a­tive views of China that have arisen since ear­lier this year,” said</p>
    <p>Pro­fes­sor Steve Tsang of the SOAS China In­sti­tute in Lon­don.</p>
    <p>It could also strengthen Bei­jing’s po­si­tion among de­vel­op­ing coun­tries which do not have the re­sources to ac­cess vac­cines and at which Covax is largely aimed.</p>
    <p>As­so­ciate Pro­fes­sor Li Mingjiang of the S. Ra­jarat­nam School of In­ter­na­tional Stud­ies said join­ing Covax was “po­lit­i­cally sym­bolic” and helps sub­stan­ti­ate promises made by Bei­jing.</p>
    <p>“We’ve al­ready seen many Chi­nese pol­icy an­nounce­ments. When­ever a Chi­nese leader has a phone call with another coun­try’s po­lit­i­cal leader or when Chi­nese se­nior of­fi­cials like (For­eign Min­is­ter) Wang Yi visit other coun­tries, they’ve al­ways men­tioned China’s will­ing­ness to pro­vide vac­cines or other sup­port to for­eign coun­tries,” said Prof Li.</p>
    <p>China has 11 Covid-19 vac­cines that are cur­rently un­der­go­ing clinical tri­als, in­clud­ing four in the fi­nal phase of test­ing.</p>
    <p>Two of those in Phase 3 test­ing be­long to Sinopharm.</p>
    <p>The group’s chair­man Yang Xiaom­ing said last month that de­vel­op­ment was mov­ing faster than ex­pected and the vac­cines could be avail­able be­fore the end of the year.</p>
    <p>They have al­ready been ap­proved for emer­gency use in the coun­try and have been ad­min­is­tered to med­i­cal work­ers and em­ploy­ees of state-owned com­pa­nies.</p>
    <p>But news that the com­pany was will­ing to let the pub­lic book vac­cine shots had sparked talk of a wider roll-out.</p>
    <p>Chi­nese me­dia re­ported on Monday that more than 90,000 peo­ple had ap­plied to re­ceive the virus shot through an ap­plet on Chi­nese mes­sag­ing app WeChat.</p>
    <p>Fol­low­ing the re­ports, the ap­plet was taken down.</p>
    <p>Shang­hai-based me­dia out­let The Pa­per spec­u­lated that the com­pany had been float­ing a test bal­loon to gauge pub­lic will­ing­ness to re­ceive a vac­cine.</p>
    <p>But the rapid pace of China’s vac­cine de­vel­op­ment has sparked doubts over the ro­bust­ness of Chi­nese test­ing, es­pe­cially since other front run­ners, in­clud­ing John­son & John­son and As­traZeneca, have paused tri­als af­ter par­tic­i­pants came down with un­ex­plained ill­nesses.</p>
    <p>De­spite th­ese ques­tions, Prof Tsang said, it is clear Bei­jing is de­ter­mined to win the vac­cine race.</p>
    <p>“It clearly wants to be seen as the lead­ing player for a so­lu­tion to Covid-19,” he said.</p>
