    <p>OCBC Bank has launched a home loan that is based on the three­month com­pounded Sin­ga­pore Overnight Rate Av­er­age (Sora) that is pub­lished by the Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore (MAS).</p>
    <p>The three-month Com­pounded Sora Home Loan is avail­able for all cat­e­gories – com­pleted prop­er­ties, those un­der con­struc­tion, new mort­gages and ex­ist­ing ones be­ing repriced.</p>
    <p>OCBC’s move re­flects the in­dus­try’s shift to­wards adopt­ing Sora as the new in­ter­est rate bench­mark for the Sing­dol­lar cash and deriva­tives mar­ket.</p>
    <p>Sora refers to the av­er­age rate of unse­cured overnight in­ter­bank Sing­dol­lar trans­ac­tions bro­kered here.</p>
    <p>OCBC’s new Com­pounded Sora</p>
    <p>Home Loan re­places a Sora-based one launched on July 13 that based in­ter­est rates on a sim­ple av­er­age of the daily Sora rates in the pre­ced­ing 90 cal­en­dar days.</p>
    <p>OCBC said it ap­proved around $50 mil­lion in loans in the first two weeks of its launch.</p>
    <p>Like the three-month Sin­ga­pore In­ter­bank Of­fered Rate (Si­bor) home loan pack­age, the three­month Com­pounded Sora deal has a two-year lock-in pe­riod. Cus­tomers can make pre­pay­ments of up to 50 per cent of the loan amount in the first two years with no penalty.</p>
    <p>Mr Sunny Quek, head of con­sumer fi­nan­cial ser­vices at OCBC, said: “We re­ceived a pos­i­tive re­sponse to the in­dus­try’s first re­tail Sora-pegged home loan that was launched last month.</p>
    <p>“This shows that con­sumers are re­cep­tive to Sora as the new in­ter­est rate bench­mark for Sing­dol­lar mar­kets.”</p>
    <p>The MAS pub­lishes Sora – as well as the com­pounded Sora rates for the one-, three- and six-month tenors – for a given busi­ness day by 9am the next busi­ness day.</p>
    <p>OCBC’s three-month Com­pounded Sora pack­age will ref­er­ence the three-month com­pounded Sora rate to cal­cu­late the monthly loan in­stal­ment, with the rate up­dated monthly in­stead of ev­ery three months.</p>
    <p>Cus­tomers will be told the in­ter­est rate and in­stal­ment amount at the start of the month, with pay­ment due at the end of the month, mak­ing it eas­ier for them to plan their fi­nances.</p>

        <p data-role="text">Sin&#xAD;ga&#xAD;pore is adopt&#xAD;ing Sora as it moves away from the SGD Swap Of&#xAD;fer Rate, which uses Libor in com&#xAD;pu&#xAD;ta&#xAD;tion. A few debt se&#xAD;cu&#xAD;ri&#xAD;ties have al&#xAD;ready been is&#xAD;sued off Sora, and 11 banks, in&#xAD;clud&#xAD;ing Deutsche Bank, Stan&#xAD;dard Char&#xAD;tered Bank, Citibank and DBS Group, are ready to trade Sora deriva&#xAD;tives, ac&#xAD;cord&#xAD;ing to a June state&#xAD;ment.</p>
