    <p>The ac­tions of Sa­muel Tan Joo Soon who fired ball bear­ings and dam­aged two cars can­not be con­doned, but I can em­pathise with his frus­tra­tions (Man gets 3 weeks’ jail over ball bear­ings shot near bri­dal party, Sept 10).</p>
    <p>The bri­dal party’s “gate­crash­ing” games be­gan around 7am on a Satur­day morn­ing – which is a day of rest for many. Such games cre­ate sub­stan­tial noise, in­clud­ing shout­ing, cheer­ing and clap­ping. Cre­at­ing loud noises at 7am in the morn­ing in a hous­ing estate is un­neigh­bourly and ir­re­spon­si­ble.</p>
    <p>Peo­ple are bound to be sleep­ing, and to be wo­ken up by these loud sounds of rev­elry so early in the morn­ing is frus­trat­ing, to say the least.</p>
    <p>I live across the road from a Bud­dhist tem­ple in Fern­vale which reg­u­larly stages getai and Chi­nese opera shows that go past 10.30pm. These events take place through­out the year – in­clud­ing dur­ing exam pe­ri­ods – and of­ten the per­form­ers are scream­ing into the mi­cro­phones.</p>
    <p>Of­ten, my school-go­ing chil­dren are un­able to study or go to sleep due to the din.</p>
    <p>Clos­ing the win­dows or bal­cony doors doesn’t help ei­ther, as the speak­ers are usu­ally set at a very high vol­ume.</p>
    <p>The tem­ple is sur­rounded by HDB flats and I am sure many res­i­dents share my frus­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>The mea­sures put in place against pub­lic per­for­mances dur­ing Covid-19 have served as a wel­come re­prieve, but I dread the day when pub­lic per­for­mances will be al­lowed again at the tem­ple.</p>
    <p>The Na­tional En­vi­ron­ment Agency (NEA) and town coun­cils should re­view the per­mis­si­ble noise lev­els be­tween 7am and 10.30pm in hous­ing es­tates.</p>
    <p>This is es­pe­cially rel­e­vant now when more peo­ple are work­ing from home dur­ing the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>I would pro­pose amend­ing the time band allowing rev­elry and pub­lic per­for­mances to be­gin no ear­lier than 9am and to end no later than 8pm.</p>
    <p>The Gov­ern­ment has stressed the need for us to be­come a more car­ing so­ci­ety. This must start in our neigh­bour­hoods and with re­spect for our neigh­bours.</p>
