    <p>OCBC Bank cus­tomers in Sin­ga­pore can now use their SingPass app to ac­cess dig­i­tal bank­ing ser­vices via the bank’s mo­bile app or In­ter­net bank­ing.</p>
    <p>OCBC is the first bank in Sin­ga­pore to of­fer this ser­vice, which started on July 4, the bank said yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The SingPass Mo­bile app serves as an al­ter­na­tive to the tra­di­tional method of log­ging in with an ac­cess code and per­sonal iden­ti­fi­ca­tion num­ber, and elim­i­nates the need to re­mem­ber mul­ti­ple such codes for dif­fer­ent ac­counts.</p>
    <p>“In­clu­sion and ac­ces­si­bil­ity have been core to our dig­i­tal trans­for­ma­tion nar­ra­tive,” said OCBC’s head of dig­i­tal busi­ness for Sin­ga­pore and Malaysia, Mr Aditya Gupta.</p>
    <p>“I be­lieve that offering SingPass – a trusted and widely used mode of dig­i­tal au­then­ti­ca­tion in Sin­ga­pore – as an al­ter­nate lo­gin, will give more of our cus­tomers the con­fi­dence and con­ve­nience to bank with us dig­i­tally.”</p>
    <p>The SingPass Mo­bile app, launched in late 2018, lets its 1.6 mil­lion users ac­cess gov­ern­ment e-ser­vices – in­clud­ing check­ing their Cen­tral Prov­i­dent Fund bal­ances and ap­ply­ing for pub­lic hous­ing – from more than 60 pub­lic agen­cies.</p>
    <p>The Covid-19 pan­demic has ac­cel­er­ated the adop­tion of dig­i­tal bank­ing in Sin­ga­pore.</p>
    <p>OCBC said nearly 100,000 cus­tomers started us­ing its dig­i­tal bank­ing ser­vices for the first time this year.</p>
    <p>Dig­i­tal trans­ac­tions by those aged 50 to 64 in­creased by 40 per cent this year, and the bank also saw a 48 per cent jump in dig­i­tal trans­ac­tions by cus­tomers aged over 64.</p>
    <p>Strict stay-home mea­sures dur­ing the cir­cuit breaker pe­riod also served to sig­nif­i­cantly re­duce foot­fall at banks’ phys­i­cal branches and drive up on­line spend­ing.</p>
    <p>The Mon­e­tary Author­ity of Sin­ga­pore’s (MAS) chief fin­tech of­fi­cer Sop­nendu Mo­hanty noted that the foun­da­tion of Sin­ga­pore’s dig­i­tal econ­omy is laid on the seam­less in­te­gra­tion of pub­lic dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­tures with es­sen­tial ser­vices.</p>
    <p>“MAS has been work­ing closely with the fi­nan­cial in­dus­try to fos­ter adop­tion of foun­da­tional dig­i­tal in­fra­struc­tures such as na­tional dig­i­tal iden­tity,” he said.</p>
    <p>“With the con­ver­gence of SingPass Mo­bile, MyInfo and PayNow, cus­tomers can open bank ac­counts, ac­cess bank­ing ser­vices and make pay­ments on­line seam­lessly yet safely.”</p>
