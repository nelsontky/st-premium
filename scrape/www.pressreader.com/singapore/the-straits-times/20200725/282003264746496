    <p>• The Euro­pean Union is in a fix. As it watches with grow­ing anx­i­ety the US and China pum­mel each other over trade, tech­nol­ogy and a grow­ing list of other is­sues, it wants to stay out of the con­flict, but finds it­self drawn in.</p>
    <p>US Sec­re­tary of State Mike Pom­peo made it all too clear what he ex­pected the EU to do when he stated em­phat­i­cally: “This isn’t the United States con­fronting China, this is the world con­fronting China.”</p>
    <p>The Euro­peans feel trapped. They feel alien­ated from the US which, un­der the Trump ad­min­is­tra­tion, comes across as a bul­ly­ing, hos­tile power rather than a Western ally. But at the same time, they can­not ig­nore Chi­nese ac­tions in Hong Kong, re­ports of hu­man rights abuses in Xin­jiang and China’s in­creas­ingly ag­gres­sive as­ser­tions of rights over dis­puted ter­ri­tory.</p>
    <p>While some in Brus­sels be­lieve that the EU is bet­ter off if it main­tains an equidis­tance be­tween both China and the US, oth­ers say that is im­pos­si­ble. The dif­fer­ences be­tween Europe and China are sim­ply too wide, they say, whether they are about val­ues, po­lit­i­cal sys­tems or a rules-based in­ter­na­tional or­der. Fur­ther­more, that gap has only grown, and con­tin­ues to grow, with Pres­i­dent Xi Jin­ping at the helm in China.</p>
    <p>China re­mains an in­dis­pens­able part­ner to Europe in sev­eral ar­eas. One is cli­mate pro­tec­tion, where co­op­er­a­tion with China, a heavy CO2 emit­ter, is vi­tal to any ef­fort to bring down car­bon lev­els.</p>
    <p>For many Euro­pean na­tions, in par­tic­u­lar an eco­nomic pow­er­house such as Ger­many, China is also a ma­jor ex­port des­ti­na­tion. How­ever, Covid- 19 has up­ended the best-laid plans. A key EU-China sum­mit that was due to take place in Leipzig, Ger­many, has been shelved, along with its plans for “Agenda 2025”, meant to lay out joint strate­gic in­ter­ests. Other high-level meet­ings have been re­duced to video­con­fer­ences, not con­ducive to of­fer­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties for the much more im­por­tant in­for­mal talks.</p>
    <p>In ad­di­tion, Bri­tain, by of­fer­ing refuge to Hong Kongers and by ban­ning Chi­nese tech­nol­ogy com­pany Huawei from tak­ing part in build­ing its 5G net­work, has com­pletely changed the tra­jec­tory of the re­la­tion­ship. In­stead of pro­gress­ing, the new motto is: Limit the dam­age.</p>
    <p>The EU has de­nounced the de­ci­sion by China’s Par­lia­ment to pass na­tional se­cu­rity leg­is­la­tion for Hong Kong de­spite in­ter­na­tional protests.</p>
    <p>How­ever, while the EU’s for­eign af­fairs com­mis­sioner Josep Bor­rell gave a state­ment on China re­cently af­ter a meet­ing of the bloc’s for­eign min­is­ters ex­pressed sol­i­dar­ity with the peo­ple of Hong Kong, he was vague on what kind of ac­tion the EU might take.</p>
    <p>Mr Bor­rell cau­tiously talked about a “re­view of our ap­proach” to­wards China and said some mem­ber states may an­nounce na­tional mea­sures. At is­sue are re­stric­tions to ex­port tear gas, rub­ber bul­lets and sur­veil­lance tech­nol­ogy to China.</p>
    <p>He also said EU gov­ern­ments could re-ex­am­ine ex­tra­di­tion agree­ments with the Hong Kong au­thor­i­ties, re­view travel ad­vice, in­crease fel­low­ships for Hong Kong stu­dents, sci­en­tists and journalist­s to make it eas­ier for them to work and live in Europe, and of­fer more visas to Hong Kongers.</p>
    <p>How­ever, the EU has so far fallen short of im­pos­ing eco­nomic sanc­tions on China. There is too much at stake.</p>
    <p>TRADE A BIG FAC­TOR</p>
    <p>Last year, China was the third-largest part­ner for EU ex­ports and the largest part­ner for EU im­ports. While the EU was ex­port­ing goods worth €198 bil­lion (S$318 bil­lion) to China, it was also im­port­ing €362 bil­lion worth of prod­ucts from China. This trade im­bal­ance is one of the con­cerns the EU wanted to ad­dress this year.</p>
    <p>At the same time, more Euro­pean com­pa­nies are in­vest­ing in China. In 2018, Ger­man com­pa­nies alone spent €90 bil­lion in build­ing new plants and mod­ernising ex­ist­ing fa­cil­i­ties in China.</p>
    <p>In or­der to swiftly get back on its feet af­ter the Covid-19 lock­down, the Ger­man econ­omy is de­pend­ing on the Chi­nese mar­ket – a mar­ket that, ac­cord­ing to re­cent eco­nomic data, is re­cov­er­ing faster than ex­pected. Against this back­drop, it is no won­der that Ger­man Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel is tip­toe­ing around the del­i­cate is­sue of China.</p>
    <p>Al­though call­ing devel­op­ments in Hong Kong a “wor­ry­ing de­vel­op­ment” ear­lier this month, she also said “none of this is a rea­son for not con­tin­u­ing talks with China”.</p>
    <p>Dr Merkel, who be­lieves that “change through trade” even­tu­ally will work, was em­pha­sis­ing that a com­mon EU stance to­wards China is needed – know­ing all too well that this is ex­tremely dif­fi­cult to achieve. This is also true for how Euro­peans deal with the thorny is­sue of Huawei.</p>
    <p>Find­ing a unan­i­mous voice on whether Huawei can take part in the build­ing of 5G net­works in Europe is tricky.</p>
    <p>Ger­many still sees the door open for the com­pany to par­tic­i­pate.</p>
    <p>Ex­clud­ing Huawei could re­sult in a five-year de­lay in con­struct­ing the net­work, ac­cord­ing to Ger­many’s Min­is­ter of the In­te­rior Horst See­hofer.</p>
    <p>But while Ger­many may be able to weather a storm with the US over Huawei, other EU mem­bers may not.</p>
    <p>Iron­i­cally, the more Wash­ing­ton pres­sures Ber­lin to back­track on its Huawei po­si­tion, the more sup­port the Chan­cel­lor gets at home. Not giv­ing in to de­mands by US Pres­i­dent Don­ald Trump goes down well with the Ger­man pub­lic.</p>
    <p>The same is true for the dis­puted gas pipe­line, Nord Stream 2, from Rus­sia to Ger­many. Re­cently, the US threat­ened par­tic­i­pat­ing com­pa­nies and coun­tries with new, se­vere sanc­tions. In a state­ment, the Ger­man Min­istry of Eco­nom­ics called this “a vi­o­la­tion of in­ter­na­tional law”.</p>
    <p>While this strat­egy may work as long as Mr Trump is in charge, things will change if Demo­crat Joe Bi­den takes over in Jan­uary next year.</p>
    <p>“Then Ger­mans can no longer hide be­hind Trump as a bo­gey­man. They even­tu­ally have to put their cards on the ta­ble,” says a po­lit­i­cal ob­server in Ber­lin.</p>
