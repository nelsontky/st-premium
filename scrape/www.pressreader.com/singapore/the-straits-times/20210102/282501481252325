    <p>LON­DON • Ugan­dan run­ner Joshua Chep­tegei says he is tar­get­ing the 5,000m-10,000m dou­ble at the Tokyo Olympics af­ter break­ing the world records in both dis­tances last year.</p>
    <p>The 24-year-old set a 10,000m mark of 26min 11.00sec at the Va­len­cia World Record Day event in Oc­to­ber to beat Ke­nenisa Bekele’s 26:17.53 set in 2005.</p>
    <p>At the Monaco Di­a­mond League meet­ing two months ear­lier, he had also bet­tered Bekele’s 16-yearold 5,000m record by al­most two sec­onds with his 12:35.36.</p>
    <p>If Chep­tegei wins gold medals in both events at this year’s post­poned Games, he would be­come only the eighth man to com­plete the dou­ble.</p>
    <p>“It would be a mountain to climb, but the chal­lenge is up to me,” he told the BBC.</p>
    <p>“It’s de­mand­ing a lot, in terms of rac­ing and mind­set but I want to give my­self a try to win both gold medals.</p>
    <p>“It would be re­ally amaz­ing to win the dou­ble, but if I win gold in the 10,000m I would still be grate­ful.”</p>
    <p>Chep­tegei, who runs in Nike’s Dragon­fly spikes – a lightweigh­t shoe that com­bines a unique foam and car­bon plates – said that his gear helped him but was not the rea­son for his suc­cess last year.</p>
    <p>A de­bate over run­ners’ shoes has been rag­ing since high-tech footwear de­vel­oped by Nike played a star­ring role in two of the big­gest dis­tance-run­ning achieve­ments of 2019.</p>
    <p>“The shoes re­ally do help. But in this case the shoes are not only avail­able to Mr Chep­tegei. They are avail­able for ev­ery­one who wants to at­tack the world record,” he added.</p>
    <p>“You have seen the likes of Yomif Ke­jelcha, Sele­mon Barega... it’s not about shoes only, but ath­letes hav­ing this pe­riod con­cen­trat­ing more on train­ing and not trav­el­ling.</p>
    <p>“I was fo­cused on just this one thing... that was break­ing the world record.”</p>
