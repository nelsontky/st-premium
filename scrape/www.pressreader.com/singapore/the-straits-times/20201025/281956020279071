    <p>• The num­ber of South Kore­ans who have died af­ter get­ting flu shots has risen to 48, the Korea Disease Con­trol and Preven­tion Agency (KDCA) said yes­ter­day, adding that the vac­cines would con­tinue to re­duce the chance of hav­ing si­mul­ta­ne­ous epi­demics.</p>
    <p>The health au­thor­i­ties said they found no di­rect link be­tween the deaths and the shots. They plan to carry on with the state-run vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme to try and avoid hav­ing to fight both the flu and the coro­n­avirus in the com­ing win­ter.</p>
    <p>“Af­ter re­view­ing death cases so far, it is not the time to sus­pend a flu vac­ci­na­tion pro­gramme since vac­ci­na­tion is very cru­cial this year, con­sid­er­ing ... the Covid-19 out­breaks,”</p>
    <p>KDCA di­rec­tor Jeong Eun-kyung told a brief­ing.</p>
    <p>Dr Jeong said the re­view had shown no di­rect link be­tween the flu shots and the 26 deaths that have been in­ves­ti­gated.</p>
    <p>Some 20 ini­tial au­topsy re­sults from the po­lice and the Na­tional Foren­sic Ser­vice showed that 13 peo­ple died of car­dio­vas­cu­lar, cere­brovas­cu­lar and other dis­or­ders not caused by the vac­ci­na­tion.</p>
    <p>The death toll among those who have been vac­ci­nated rose by 12 cases from a day ear­lier to 48 yes­ter­day.</p>
    <p>The ris­ing fa­tal­i­ties have caused some doc­tors and politi­cians to call for a halt to the gov­ern­ment cam­paign to vac­ci­nate about 30 mil­lion of the coun­try’s 54 mil­lion peo­ple.</p>
    <p>While en­cour­ag­ing peo­ple to get flu jabs, Dr Jeong is­sued pre­cau­tions to take be­fore get­ting the shot, such as drink­ing enough wa­ter and telling health­care work­ers about any un­der­ly­ing med­i­cal con­di­tions.</p>
    <p>She also ad­vised peo­ple to wait for 15-30 min­utes be­fore leav­ing the clinic where they re­ceive their vac­cine.</p>
    <p>“If pos­si­ble, try to get the flu shot when it’s warm, since there are con­cerns that low tem­per­a­tures could af­fect car­dio­vas­cu­lar disease or cere­brovas­cu­lar disease,” she said.</p>
    <p>The KDCA said 9.4 mil­lion peo­ple had been in­oc­u­lated as of Fri­day in the pro­gramme that be­gan last month, with 1,154 cases of ad­verse re­ac­tions.</p>
    <p>South Korea re­ported 77 new coro­n­avirus cases as of Fri­day mid­night, bring­ing to­tal in­fec­tions to 25,775, with 457 deaths.</p>
