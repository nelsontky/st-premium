    <p>A group of for­eign min­is­ters from 30 small and medium coun­tries, in­clud­ing Sin­ga­pore, on Wed­nes­day stressed the need for the in­ter­na­tional com­mu­nity to build on the mo­men­tum from the Covid-19 pan­demic to speed up tech­no­log­i­cal devel­op­ment and dig­i­tal­i­sa­tion.</p>
    <p>This will make coun­tries better able to with­stand fu­ture shocks, said the mem­bers of the Global Gov­er­nance Group (3G) who also re­it­er­ated their sup­port for an en­vi­ron­men­tally sus­tain­able and in­clu­sive re­cov­ery, in line with the Paris Agree­ment, as a cru­cial el­e­ment of fu­ture re­silience.</p>
    <p>“The 3G min­is­ters strongly wel­comed the G-20’s con­tin­ued ef­forts in ad­vanc­ing the United Na­tions’ 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment, in­clud­ing cli­mate ac­tion, with a fo­cus on sup­port­ing de­vel­op­ing coun­tries in their im­ple­men­ta­tion ef­forts,” said the min­is­ters in a press state­ment re­leased by Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs af­ter the 3G’s 13th min­is­te­rial meet­ing.</p>
    <p>The 3G is an in­for­mal coali­tion of 30 states, which in­clude Sin­ga­pore, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philip­pines and Viet­nam, as well as Fin­land, New Zealand, Qatar, Switzer­land and the United Arab Emi­rates. It was formed in 2009 to in­flu­ence the Group of 20 (G-20) coun­tries to take into ac­count the in­ter­ests of smaller coun­tries af­fected by its de­ci­sions, and is reg­u­larly rep­re­sented at its sum­mits.</p>
    <p>Wed­nes­day’s min­is­te­rial meet­ing, which was held over video con­fer­ence, took place on the side­lines of the 75th ses­sion of the United Na­tions Gen­eral Assem­bly, which is be­ing held al­most en­tirely vir­tu­ally this year due to Covid-19 travel re­stric­tions.</p>
    <p>Dur­ing the meet­ing, other is­sues – such as the im­por­tance of fa­cil­i­tat­ing tech­nol­ogy trans­fer and nar­row­ing the dig­i­tal di­vide, as well as the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing open sup­ply chains glob­ally – were also dis­cussed.</p>
    <p>Con­cerns over in­ten­si­fied pro­tec­tion­ist ten­den­cies and con­tin­ued trade con­flicts were also raised, with the min­is­ters not­ing that these could ex­ac­er­bate the eco­nomic cri­sis and hin­der re­cov­ery.</p>
    <p>To this end, a univer­sal, rules­based, open, trans­par­ent, non-dis­crim­i­na­tory and eq­ui­table mul­ti­lat­eral trad­ing sys­tem un­der the World Trade Or­gan­i­sa­tion (WTO) should be pro­moted, said the min­is­ters. Trade-re­stric­tive emer­gency mea­sures aimed at pro­tect­ing health, if deemed nec­es­sary, should be tar­geted, pro­por­tion­ate, trans­par­ent, tem­po­rary, and be con­sis­tent with WTO rules, they added.</p>
    <p>The var­i­ous mea­sures en­dorsed by the G-20, in­clud­ing strate­gies such as trade reg­u­la­tion and fa­cil­i­ta­tion; the pro­vi­sion of sup­port for mi­cro, small and medium-sized en­ter­prises, as well as build­ing re­silience in global sup­ply chains, are much ap­pre­ci­ated, noted the min­is­ters.</p>
    <p>They also said they wel­comed the G-20’s ef­forts to reach out to non-G-20 mem­bers to re­flect a “broad and in­clu­sive range of in­ter­na­tional in­ter­ests and per­spec­tives”.</p>
    <p>The 3G also com­mended Saudi Arabia – which holds the G-20 pres­i­dency for this year – for its lead­er­ship in gal­vanis­ing in­ter­na­tional ef­forts to ad­dress the chal­lenges posed by Covid-19, and said it looked for­ward to con­tin­u­ing the part­ner­ship with the group­ing un­der Italy’s pres­i­dency next year.</p>
    <p>The 3G min­is­ters strongly wel­comed the G-20’s con­tin­ued ef­forts in ad­vanc­ing the United Na­tions’ 2030 Agenda for Sus­tain­able Devel­op­ment, in­clud­ing cli­mate ac­tion, with a fo­cus on sup­port­ing de­vel­op­ing coun­tries in their im­ple­men­ta­tion ef­forts.</p>
    <p>MIN­IS­TERS from mem­ber coun­tries of the Global Gov­er­nance Group, in a press state­ment re­leased by Sin­ga­pore’s Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs af­ter the 3G’s 13th min­is­te­rial meet­ing.</p>
