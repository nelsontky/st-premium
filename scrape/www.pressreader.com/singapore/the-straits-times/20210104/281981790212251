    <p>The pro­fes­sors at the Na­tional Univer­sity of Sin­ga­pore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Pub­lic Health raised good points in their com­men­tary about fight­ing the smok­ing scourge (Why stop at 21? Aim for higher min­i­mum age for to­bacco sales, Jan 1).</p>
    <p>I would like to make some sug­ges­tions re­gard­ing des­ig­nated smok­ing zones.</p>
    <p>Put up posters at all such des­ig­nated ar­eas show­ing neg­a­tive and pos­i­tive ex­am­ples of peo­ple.</p>
    <p>For neg­a­tive ex­am­ples, this could mean show­ing how smok­ing can cause lung dam­age and can­cer, sim­i­lar to some of the im­ages on cig­a­rette packs.</p>
    <p>For pos­i­tive ex­am­ples, show a photo of a healthy fam­ily, with a cap­tion of the par­ents say­ing: “If you want to live a long life and watch your chil­dren grow up, do not smoke.”</p>
    <p>Posters should in­clude cur­rent data on how many peo­ple in Sin­ga­pore die each year be­cause of ex­po­sure to sec­ond-hand smoke, com­pared with the death rate of Covid-19.</p>
    <p>This is just an­other way to get into the psy­che or sub­con­scious mind of the smoker while he smokes at these ar­eas.</p>
    <p>Hope­fully, af­ter see­ing these posters, he would have sec­ond thoughts about smok­ing – he would start to think of oth­ers in­stead of giv­ing in to his own habit, and make a per­sonal sac­ri­fice to stop smok­ing.</p>
    <p>For young smok­ers, it could also serve as a stark re­minder of what their fu­ture could be like, health-wise.</p>
