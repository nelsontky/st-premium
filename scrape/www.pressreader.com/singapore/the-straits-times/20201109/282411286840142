    <p>It is Viet­nam’s turn to chair the 10-mem­ber As­so­ci­a­tion for South­east Asian Na­tions (Asean) this year.</p>
    <p>While all eyes are on the Asean Sum­mit to be held in Hanoi from Wed­nes­day to Sun­day, Viet­nam’s eco­nomic suc­cess story, too, has been the sub­ject of much at­ten­tion.</p>
    <p>Its econ­omy has con­sis­tently turned in a strong per­for­mance in the past decade, grow­ing by 5 per cent to 7 per cent each year. For­eign in­vestors are es­pe­cially drawn by its ex­pand­ing mid­dle class, vi­brant pri­vate sec­tor and young pop­u­la­tion. About 70 per cent of its 95 mil­lion peo­ple are younger than 35.</p>
    <p>ECO­NOMIC OP­POR­TU­NI­TIES</p>
    <p>For Sin­ga­pore, eco­nomic ties are a “main­stay” of its re­la­tion­ship with Viet­nam, said its first fe­male Am­bas­sador to Viet­nam Cather­ine Wong.</p>
    <p>Speak­ing to The Straits Times last Wed­nes­day from Hanoi, where she is based, Ms Wong said Sin­ga­pore is the third-largest for­eign di­rect in­vestor in the coun­try.</p>
    <p>“This is very sig­nif­i­cant be­cause the top two in­vestors are South Korea and Ja­pan, which are far larger economies than us.”</p>
    <p>Long­stand­ing sym­bols of co­op­er­a­tion in­clude a 24-year-old Viet­nam-Sin­ga­pore In­dus­trial Park joint ven­ture, plus a con­nec­tiv­ity frame­work agree­ment since 2006 to boost col­lab­o­ra­tion in sec­tors such as fi­nance, in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy and trans­port.</p>
    <p>But there are new op­por­tu­ni­ties, and she has set her sights on Viet­nam’s rapidly grow­ing in­fra­struc­ture, ur­ban so­lu­tions, in­no­va­tion and start-ups, and e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>An­other growth area is agri­cul­tural trade. “We hope to di­ver­sify</p>
    <p>our sources of food sup­ply by bring­ing more Viet­namese agri­cul­tural prod­ucts and seafood into Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
    <p>Be­sides sup­port­ing Sin­ga­pore’s eco­nomic in­ter­ests, keep­ing in touch with Sin­ga­pore­ans liv­ing in Viet­nam and pro­vid­ing con­sular ser­vices are an im­por­tant part of the em­bassy’s work. They took on a re­newed fo­cus amid the pan­demic.</p>
    <p>When Viet­nam an­nounced the clo­sure of its bor­ders in March and in­ter­na­tional flights were about to be sus­pended, the em­bassy had to work fast with the rel­e­vant agen­cies to en­sure Sin­ga­pore­ans in Viet­nam who wanted to re­turn home could do so.</p>
    <p>FOOD AND CUL­TURAL OUT­REACH</p>
    <p>When the Na­tional Day re­cep­tion and reg­u­lar meet-ups with Sin­ga­pore­ans in the city were can­celled this year, Ms Wong found other ways to reach out to them.</p>
    <p>Her team put to­gether care pack­ages of Irvin’s salted egg fish skin snacks, Ya Kun Pocky bis­cuit sticks, re­us­able face masks and hand sani­tis­ers for Sin­ga­pore­ans in Hanoi.</p>
    <p>The Sin­ga­pore con­sulate-gen­eral in Ho Chi Minh City dis­patched Prima Taste laksa in­stant noo­dle packs and ready-to-cook packet sauces to pre­pare dishes such as chicken rice and ren­dang.</p>
    <p>To pro­mote bet­ter un­der­stand­ing of Sin­ga­pore and show­case its mul­ti­cul­tur­al­ism, the first Sin­ga­pore Fes­ti­val in Hanoi was held in March last year, fea­tur­ing art in­stal­la­tions and fash­ion shows.</p>
    <p>VIET­NAM’S HAN­DLING OF COVID-19</p>
    <p>Ms Wong had this to say of Viet­nam’s low Covid-19 death rate.</p>
    <p>“They took some very tough mea­sures, re­acted quickly, and pre­pared early for pos­si­ble lo­cal in­fec­tions after the first cases in China emerged. They also de­vel­oped their own test kits and ven­ti­la­tors, and are work­ing on de­vel­op­ing a vac­cine.”</p>
    <p>Viet­nam ex­pe­ri­enced two waves of in­fec­tions – one in March and April, and a more lo­calised out­break in Danang city in July and Au­gust. But the au­thor­i­ties’ swift re­sponse and com­pre­hen­sive lock­down mea­sures put a lid on lo­cal trans­mis­sions.</p>
    <p>For this rea­son, Sin­ga­pore was con­fi­dent in uni­lat­er­ally lift­ing bor­der re­stric­tions to its vis­i­tors from Oct 8, she said.</p>
    <p>Viet­nam’s bor­ders, how­ever, re­main closed. The next step is to see how two-way travel can be eased with health and safety pre­cau­tions in place, she added.</p>
    <p>WOMEN IN DIPLO­MACY</p>
    <p>Ms Wong, who is sin­gle and has worked in the Min­istry of For­eign Af­fairs (MFA) for 25 years, said she “never got bored enough to leave”.</p>
    <p>The job took her to Hong Kong, where she wit­nessed the han­dover of Hong Kong and Ma­cau to China in 1997; and to Washington, DC, in 2016, when she headed MFA’s Amer­i­cas Direc­torate and or­gan­ised Prime Min­is­ter Lee Hsien Loong’s of­fi­cial visit to the United States in the fi­nal year of the Obama ad­min­is­tra­tion.</p>
    <p>Do women in the for­eign ser­vice face par­tic­u­lar chal­lenges? One chal­lenge fac­ing sin­gle women of­fi­cers, she said, is that they have to play mul­ti­ple roles in over­seas post­ings. “I’m ex­pected to be the am­bas­sador in terms of sub­stan­tive mat­ters. But be­cause I don’t have a hus­band, and I’m a woman, I also have to play the role of a diplo­matic spouse.”</p>
    <p>This could mean see­ing to the ar­range­ments for host­ing diplo­matic events, or tak­ing part in rep­re­sen­ta­tional ac­tiv­i­ties that spouses usu­ally at­tend.</p>
    <p>But a for­eign ser­vice ca­reer of­fers unique ex­po­sure, she said.</p>
    <p>The trick is to be adapt­able. “You can plan un­til the cows come home, but the re­al­ity is some­thing will hap­pen to­mor­row that will mess up all your plans. The for­eign ser­vice is not just a ca­reer choice – it re­ally is a life­style choice.”</p>
    <p>Sin­ga­pore’s first fe­male Am­bas­sador to Viet­nam Cather­ine Wong has set her sights on Viet­nam’s rapidly grow­ing in­fra­struc­ture, ur­ban so­lu­tions, in­no­va­tion and start-ups, and e-com­merce.</p>
    <p>An­other growth area is agri­cul­tural trade. “We hope to di­ver­sify our sources of food sup­ply by bring­ing more Viet­namese agri­cul­tural prod­ucts and seafood into Sin­ga­pore.”</p>
